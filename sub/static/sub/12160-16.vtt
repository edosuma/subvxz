WEBVTT

00:08.119 --> 00:11.155
Aah! Holy crap!

00:11.223 --> 00:12.657
Eve, honey, look,

00:12.725 --> 00:14.358
if you don't want people
to think you're a tomboy,

00:14.426 --> 00:16.693
then maybe you shouldn't
talk like an auto mechanic.

00:16.761 --> 00:18.495
Hey, I'm just saying,

00:18.563 --> 00:21.998
this freakin' wind deserves
a little more than a <i>"wow."</i>

00:22.066 --> 00:25.702
Ho-ho! Holy crap!

00:25.770 --> 00:28.004
Nice. Nice. Where did
you girls get your eloquence?

00:28.072 --> 00:30.273
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:30.341 --> 00:33.309
Whoa. That wind is
blowing like a mother--

00:33.376 --> 00:35.511
Mike!

00:35.579 --> 00:36.879
Sorry. Just saying.

00:36.947 --> 00:38.981
We couldn't be more secure, though.

00:39.049 --> 00:43.553
'Cause this little piggy
made his house out of brick.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.988
You know, Boyd is actually
sleeping through this?

00:46.056 --> 00:48.022
That's 'cause he trusts his
grandpa to take care of things.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.059
He shows that trust by snoring
and peeing in those pull-ups.

00:51.126 --> 00:53.528
Ooh. I should get the candles ready.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.129
Why do you get the candles ready?

00:55.197 --> 00:56.698
The generator's all gassed up.

00:56.766 --> 01:00.201
Yeah, just like its owner.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.736
You're the one
that makes Brussels sprouts.

01:02.804 --> 01:05.438
Oh, my God. Daddy, I'm so scared.

01:05.507 --> 01:06.406
It's gonna be just fine.

01:06.475 --> 01:07.775
Aw, come on, Mandy.

01:07.843 --> 01:08.943
We've huddled through
bigger storms than this.

01:09.010 --> 01:11.812
But Kim Kardashian
is on her book tour.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.914
She could be on a plane right now,

01:13.982 --> 01:15.516
and the thought of her
bouncing around up there

01:15.584 --> 01:17.785
just terrifies me.

01:17.853 --> 01:19.619
Isn't the thought
of her bouncing around

01:19.687 --> 01:22.202
what made her famous
in the first place?

01:24.458 --> 01:26.726
You guys, Kim has been
through so much lately,

01:26.794 --> 01:28.461
but I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

01:28.529 --> 01:31.731
And... we don't.

01:31.799 --> 01:34.367
Dad, how would you feel
if your precious Tim Tebow

01:34.434 --> 01:35.868
was flying in this weather?

01:35.935 --> 01:37.736
I'm sure he'd be fine.
If the airplane got in trouble,

01:37.804 --> 01:41.054
he could just carry the plane
to safety on his back.

01:43.510 --> 01:45.443
Those trees look like
they're about to come down.

01:45.512 --> 01:47.412
I've trimmed all of our trees.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.114
Mother nature and I go
toe-to-toe all the time.

01:49.181 --> 01:50.781
She's never gotten
the better of your dad.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.082
What about when
the pipes froze and burst

01:52.150 --> 01:53.283
and flooded the cabin?

01:53.351 --> 01:56.387
Ah, that was <i>Mr.</i> Nature.

01:56.454 --> 01:58.055
That big one near the street

01:58.123 --> 01:59.857
looks like it could go at any second.

01:59.925 --> 02:02.126
Look. That's a city tree.
I've trimmed that, too.

02:02.193 --> 02:04.595
Come on. Look, guys, we're all right.

02:04.663 --> 02:05.963
We're in our own house.
We couldn't be safer.

02:06.931 --> 02:08.131
Ooh, whoa, whoa.

02:13.303 --> 02:15.438
Holy crap!

02:15.807 --> 02:17.866
Last Man Standing - S01E16
Tree of Strife

02:17.986 --> 02:19.785
Original air date
February 7, 2012

02:19.905 --> 02:22.905
Sync ad corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

02:23.513 --> 02:25.247
Can't believe that guy
from the city's already here.

02:25.314 --> 02:26.749
They usually make you wait all day.

02:26.816 --> 02:27.950
Yeah, well, dad said he saw the nest

02:28.018 --> 02:30.437
of an endangered spotted owl
in the tree.

02:31.988 --> 02:34.523
So if a taxpayer's property
is damaged,

02:34.591 --> 02:35.758
they can wait all day,

02:35.825 --> 02:36.926
but if a precious bird
is in jeopardy?

02:36.993 --> 02:39.861
"Oh, we'll get right on that."

02:39.929 --> 02:41.990
Government!

02:43.899 --> 02:47.068
It's like a Mike Baxter
with pigtails.

02:48.771 --> 02:52.373
Good news. You guys, Kim is
safely on the ground in Vegas.

02:52.441 --> 02:54.141
Thank God.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.211
Right on schedule for her trip...

02:58.279 --> 02:59.947
To the Cherry Hill
mall in Denver.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.448
Well, maybe you can stop
at a bookstore

03:01.515 --> 03:03.116
and pick up something
interesting to read.

03:03.184 --> 03:06.419
Oh, mama, when are you gonna
give up on me?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.989
So, guys, you only have one chance

03:09.057 --> 03:11.023
to make a first impression,
so when I meet Kim,

03:11.091 --> 03:13.693
should I recite
my haiku or my limerick?

03:13.760 --> 03:15.895
Let's hear 'em!
Okay.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.163
Haiku first...

03:18.231 --> 03:20.132
"Beauty, in and out.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.868
"Defining class, grace, and style.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.657
Kim Kardashian."

03:26.806 --> 03:28.539
That's--that's good, Mandy.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.108
That's good. Yeah.
Okay. <i>Or...</i>

03:30.175 --> 03:32.176
Should I go with the limerick?
Ready? Um...

03:32.244 --> 03:34.846
Okay. "The fairest
of Kardashian Lasses,

03:34.914 --> 03:37.348
"Kim K. Brought style to the masses.

03:37.416 --> 03:39.884
"She did it with flair
and a toss of her hair

03:39.952 --> 03:41.920
and one of the world's
most spectacular--"

03:41.988 --> 03:43.687
The haiku!

03:46.024 --> 03:51.762
So I don't see the nest
of any near-threatened species.

03:53.665 --> 03:56.366
Good hustle
getting over here, though.

03:57.702 --> 03:59.836
So what seems to be the issue?

04:05.575 --> 04:08.277
Uh...

04:08.345 --> 04:10.412
Well...

04:10.480 --> 04:14.450
What do you say we, uh, take a guess?

04:14.518 --> 04:16.551
Gotta do it in a hurry,
'cause I gotta get to work,

04:16.619 --> 04:20.088
earn some money
so I can pay your salary.

04:20.156 --> 04:22.124
Well, first things first,
mister, uh...

04:22.191 --> 04:23.458
- Baxter.
- Baxter, yes.

04:23.526 --> 04:26.061
Article II, section 57-17--

04:26.129 --> 04:29.430
a "tree" shall mean any
perennial Woody plant,

04:29.498 --> 04:33.267
usually, but not necessarily
single-stemmed and long-lived,

04:33.334 --> 04:35.936
with a height
greater than overall spread.

04:36.004 --> 04:37.204
Check.

04:42.644 --> 04:46.346
Wow. So we--we have established
that this is a tree?

04:46.414 --> 04:48.214
Yeah. Check.

04:48.282 --> 04:49.749
Right. Uh-huh.

04:49.817 --> 04:52.585
And as a tree,
per the recent council motion,

04:52.653 --> 04:55.521
the city is absolved
of all fiscal responsibility.

04:55.589 --> 04:59.125
The city voted not to be
responsible for city trees?

04:59.193 --> 05:02.628
Not <i>fiscally</i> responsible.

05:02.696 --> 05:05.964
Are you emotionally responsible?

05:06.032 --> 05:08.100
You know,
this is actually very lucky.

05:08.168 --> 05:09.467
Is it?

05:09.535 --> 05:11.570
Yeah. I mean, no one was hurt, right?

05:11.637 --> 05:13.972
Plus this black Walnut shows signs

05:14.040 --> 05:16.474
of thousand cankers disease.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.910
I got that in a locker room
once. Ever had that?

05:18.977 --> 05:22.613
It's very itchy.

05:22.681 --> 05:24.481
Not really much
of a sportsman myself.

05:24.549 --> 05:25.482
No kiddin'.

05:25.550 --> 05:26.851
Anywho,

05:26.919 --> 05:29.787
in accordance with article II,
section 57-21

05:29.855 --> 05:33.457
relating to the removal
of dead and dangerous trees,

05:33.525 --> 05:35.592
you're gonna need to chop down
this black Walnut.

05:35.659 --> 05:36.956
It's a hazard.

05:38.395 --> 05:41.497
This is the hazard. There's
nothing wrong with that one.

05:41.565 --> 05:43.533
Yes, there is, see?

05:43.601 --> 05:46.803
Well, you just made my tree
a hazard by checking it.

05:46.871 --> 05:49.135
Yeah. Well, now it's official.

05:51.074 --> 05:52.374
If you'd like to appeal the decision,

05:52.442 --> 05:53.743
you can always come down and appear

05:53.810 --> 05:55.177
before the city forestry board.

05:55.245 --> 05:57.446
I'm kind of the chairman
of that board.

05:57.513 --> 05:58.848
You know, I'd, uh,

05:58.915 --> 06:01.851
I'd rather have my left nut
caught in a car door.

06:06.056 --> 06:07.622
Okeydokey.

06:09.524 --> 06:11.025
I'm gonna go ahead and put you down

06:11.093 --> 06:13.728
as waiving your right to appeal.

06:13.796 --> 06:16.231
Walk me through this, all right?
Sure.

06:16.298 --> 06:18.532
So the city's not
gonna be responsible

06:18.600 --> 06:20.935
for one of your trees
that fell on my yard,

06:21.003 --> 06:23.170
but you want me to cut down
my tree on my yard?

06:23.238 --> 06:26.439
Oh, sir. You're not gonna make
this difficult, are you?

06:26.507 --> 06:28.642
Why don't we ask
the building inspector

06:28.709 --> 06:31.411
who's decomposing in my crawl space?

06:33.481 --> 06:34.764
Have a good one.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:43.881 --> 06:45.348
Hey, Mike, what's up?

06:45.416 --> 06:46.850
You're usually the first one in here.

06:46.918 --> 06:48.951
Oh, I spent the morning dealing
with the city bureaucrat.

06:49.019 --> 06:51.531
I've had prostate exams
that were more comfortable.

06:53.790 --> 06:57.293
There's no more soul-crushing
adversary than the man.

06:57.361 --> 06:58.694
- "The man"?
- Yeah.

06:58.762 --> 07:00.330
- What are you, a Black Panther?
- Oh, yeah.

07:00.397 --> 07:03.833
Briefly.
It was the '60s.

07:03.900 --> 07:07.902
Well, "the man" wants me to
remove a tree from my own yard.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.606
Oh, all right. Let me guess.
Now you love that tree

07:10.673 --> 07:13.575
because it symbolizes
the growth of your family.

07:13.643 --> 07:18.013
I couldn't give a duck fart
about that stupid tree.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.515
I just don't like <i>the man</i> telling me

07:19.582 --> 07:21.582
what I can and can't do
on my own property.

07:21.650 --> 07:22.750
Yeah, I understand.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.985
Well, that means you've got to fight.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.387
Not that book.
Don't bring that book out.

07:26.455 --> 07:31.659
Using the principles of
"The Art of War" by... Sun Tzu!

07:31.726 --> 07:35.563
That's just
for ancient Chinese warriors.

07:35.631 --> 07:38.131
Oh, really? Really?
How about when Ted's tackle box

07:38.199 --> 07:41.568
threatened to open
a store a mile from us, huh?

07:41.636 --> 07:45.238
Listen, I used the tactic
on page 37 right here.

07:45.306 --> 07:48.408
Is that in Chinese?

07:48.476 --> 07:49.676
The point is I bribed the realtor

07:49.743 --> 07:51.678
to sell us the lot, remember?

07:51.745 --> 07:54.280
Because all war is deception.

07:54.347 --> 07:55.447
Right, right.

07:55.515 --> 07:58.551
According to the great Sun Tzu.

07:58.618 --> 08:00.186
It's a cliche,

08:00.253 --> 08:02.655
but there's gotta be a way
that we can fight city hall.

08:02.722 --> 08:03.822
All right, you can use your agility

08:03.890 --> 08:05.891
against their clumsy, ponderous size.

08:05.958 --> 08:07.560
It's guerilla warfare, man.

08:07.627 --> 08:10.728
You know, as much as I'd like
to grab an assault rifle,

08:10.796 --> 08:12.330
paint myself green,
go in the mountains,

08:12.398 --> 08:15.333
this is happening in my suburban
front lawn, my friend.

08:15.401 --> 08:16.534
They--they move slow.
They move--I got it.

08:16.602 --> 08:17.868
They move fast.

08:17.936 --> 08:19.437
Don't say it again.
Don't say it again.

08:19.505 --> 08:20.938
This is to your infinite advantage

08:21.006 --> 08:22.940
according to the great <i>Sun Tzu!</i>

08:26.611 --> 08:28.011
Wow.

08:28.079 --> 08:30.314
I heard something let go, man.

08:30.381 --> 08:33.482
No, no, just--
okay.

08:35.986 --> 08:38.655
Oh. I always loved this tree.

08:38.722 --> 08:40.023
Yeah.

08:40.091 --> 08:41.924
Remember when I hit
my head on the low branch

08:41.991 --> 08:45.127
and got 15 stitches?

08:45.195 --> 08:46.095
Or when I fell out of the tire swing

08:46.162 --> 08:48.297
and broke my wrist?

08:48.365 --> 08:51.834
Yeah, so many incredible memories.

08:51.901 --> 08:54.903
- Guys, it's just a tree.
- Honey.

08:54.971 --> 08:57.272
Yeah, but this is the first tree
I kissed a boy under.

08:57.340 --> 08:59.541
Oh, my God. Me, too.

09:01.277 --> 09:02.977
Jake Borelli.

09:08.050 --> 09:11.353
Classy.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.420
Nobody's gonna cut
this tree down. You know why?

09:13.488 --> 09:15.122
'Cause they're bureaucrats,
and the only thing

09:15.189 --> 09:17.591
they can do quickly
is give themselves a raise.

09:17.659 --> 09:18.925
Mr. Baxter!

09:18.993 --> 09:20.494
Dad, it's the government.

09:20.562 --> 09:23.297
The city is acting in accordance
with article 2, section 57-21--

09:23.365 --> 09:25.031
listen, we have an document
we'd like to present.

09:25.099 --> 09:26.900
How about the bill of rights?

09:26.968 --> 09:28.834
Yeah, maybe you've heard
of the fourth amendment?

09:28.902 --> 09:31.404
Yeah, well, that protects
against searching and seizing,

09:31.472 --> 09:33.539
not, uh, not sawing.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.742
Hey, hey, do you even care
that this tree's been a part

09:35.809 --> 09:38.378
of our family and grown up
with us over the years?

09:38.445 --> 09:41.080
What do <i>you</i> think?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.615
Take it down.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.216
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:44.284 --> 09:48.387
Wait, wait. Do you have
an H-SR219 form?

09:48.454 --> 09:50.455
Uh... well...

09:50.523 --> 09:52.724
You do know you're required
to show proof that this action

09:52.792 --> 09:55.360
won't have a deleterious effect
on the soil.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.963
Yeah, deleterious.

09:59.031 --> 09:59.964
Suck it!

10:00.032 --> 10:02.722
Easy! Hey, hey.

10:04.536 --> 10:06.970
What are you,
some kind of a geologist?

10:07.038 --> 10:08.372
Yeah, the worst kind--

10:08.440 --> 10:12.064
a geologist with a bad attitude
and nothing to lose.

10:13.745 --> 10:15.813
All right. You're right.
You win this round,

10:15.880 --> 10:17.880
but we'll be back with an H-SR219,

10:17.948 --> 10:20.049
and then this tree is coming down.

10:20.117 --> 10:21.785
- You do that.
- Wow.

10:21.852 --> 10:23.787
"A geologist with a bad attitude
and nothing to lose."

10:23.854 --> 10:26.022
That's your mom talkin'.

10:26.089 --> 10:28.825
Damn straight.

10:28.892 --> 10:31.461
Yeah. What are we gonna do
when he comes back

10:31.529 --> 10:33.429
with an H-SR219?

10:34.013 --> 10:35.564
Tell you what we we're gonna do.
I told you girls always fight

10:35.632 --> 10:37.800
for what you believe in, right?
We're Baxters. We don't give up.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.968
I say we fight this in city hall.

10:40.036 --> 10:41.570
Honey, I thought you didn't
care about the tree.

10:41.638 --> 10:43.071
- I don't.
- Right.

10:43.139 --> 10:44.807
But I care about the people
that care about the tree.

10:44.874 --> 10:47.476
- Aw, daddy!
- All right, all right, all right.

10:47.544 --> 10:50.277
That's enough, that's enough,
that's enough.

10:50.346 --> 10:51.713
Little bit more.

10:57.386 --> 10:58.753
Okay, we're ready.

10:58.821 --> 11:01.222
All right, Eve.
What are you gonna do?

11:01.289 --> 11:03.090
I am circulating an online petition.

11:03.158 --> 11:04.958
That's a great idea.

11:05.025 --> 11:06.393
Oh, I signed one of those once. Yeah.

11:06.461 --> 11:10.122
Didn't have quite the effect
on the Taliban we'd hoped.

11:13.401 --> 11:14.835
All right, Kris,
what are you gonna do?

11:14.902 --> 11:17.371
Okay, well, I'm gonna call
the local environmental group,

11:17.438 --> 11:18.705
'cause I wanna see
if we can get, like,

11:18.773 --> 11:20.373
a big group of people together
for a tree sit-in.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.674
I like trees.
I don't like tree huggers.

11:21.742 --> 11:23.208
Let's not do that.

11:23.276 --> 11:25.043
Shoot for the emotions.

11:25.111 --> 11:27.713
Get an emotional appeal somehow.

11:27.781 --> 11:28.614
Okay, you know what?
I've got a great idea.

11:28.682 --> 11:29.815
Great. Great, great.

11:29.883 --> 11:31.717
All right, Mandy?
Um...

11:31.785 --> 11:33.318
I'm kinda spending tomorrow

11:33.387 --> 11:36.721
with my new best friend,
Kim Kardashian, so...

11:36.789 --> 11:39.391
You're never going to be
friends with a Kardashian,

11:39.458 --> 11:41.493
not even rob.

11:43.896 --> 11:45.096
Hater alert!

11:45.163 --> 11:46.831
Raising my shields.

11:46.899 --> 11:49.166
Blocking it out.

11:52.437 --> 11:54.037
Honey, what are you gonna do?

11:54.105 --> 11:56.473
I am gonna go dig up some dirt.

11:56.541 --> 11:59.676
Ah, blackmail city officials.
I like it.

11:59.744 --> 12:02.078
No, I'm gonna actually dig dirt,
get soil samples.

12:02.146 --> 12:03.614
Wanna help?

12:03.681 --> 12:07.951
<i>Oh,</i> yeah. I'd like to.

12:08.019 --> 12:11.921
I didn't think so.

12:30.039 --> 12:31.640
Hi.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.041
What's your name?

12:33.108 --> 12:35.376
Fandy!
I'm your biggest man.

12:35.445 --> 12:37.145
Oh, my God.
Kim, Kim, seriously,

12:37.212 --> 12:38.780
you look so beautiful.

12:38.848 --> 12:40.581
Thanks, Fandy.

12:40.649 --> 12:42.015
Can I give you a hug?

12:42.083 --> 12:43.584
Sure. I could use one.

12:43.652 --> 12:46.487
Oh, my God! I'm gonna give
Kim Kardashian a hug! I rule!

12:48.590 --> 12:50.223
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
Oh, God.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.692
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.126
No, I'm sorry. Um, we're still
doing the hug, though, right?

12:53.194 --> 12:54.962
Now I'm thinking no hug.

12:55.029 --> 12:57.864
I'm not leaving
till I hug you. No, sir. Sir!

12:57.932 --> 12:59.432
Please take your hands off of me!

12:59.500 --> 13:01.000
No, Kim, listen.
I wrote you two poems.

13:01.068 --> 13:04.170
Hey! One is a haiku!
It's really, really short!

13:04.237 --> 13:06.906
Kim, I love you!

13:13.050 --> 13:16.799
<i>Whoo! Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man,</i>

13:16.867 --> 13:19.568
<i>cruising across the Colorado
terrain in my A.T.V.</i>

13:19.636 --> 13:22.304
<i>That's right.
It's the 900 series reaper.</i>

13:22.372 --> 13:24.339
<i>Lot of power in this baby.
Thank God.</i>

13:24.407 --> 13:27.442
<i>Look at that!
See ya, suckers!</i>

13:27.510 --> 13:30.044
<i>That's right. It's an A.T.V.</i>

13:30.112 --> 13:31.880
<i>The government wants to call it
an S.T.V.--</i>

13:31.947 --> 13:33.347
<i>a</i> some <i>terrain vehicle--</i>

13:33.415 --> 13:34.782
<i>tell you where
you're supposed to drive it.</i>

13:34.849 --> 13:36.717
<i>You're not allowed to drive it
on public roads.</i>

13:36.785 --> 13:39.720
<i>Why? Well, 'cause frankly,
it's not that safe.</i>

13:39.788 --> 13:43.056
<i>Good call on that one,</i> man.

13:43.124 --> 13:45.626
<i>Yeah, the man--always wants to
tell you where and when</i>

13:45.694 --> 13:48.329
<i>you can do things.
When do they cross the line?</i>

13:48.397 --> 13:49.696
<i>You know when they cross the line?</i>

13:49.764 --> 13:51.164
<i>When they get into private property.</i>

13:51.231 --> 13:52.465
<i>The man shouldn't be telling me</i>

13:52.533 --> 13:53.833
<i>what to do on my private property.</i>

13:53.901 --> 13:56.135
<i>Heck, I don't tell him</i>

13:56.203 --> 13:58.104
<i>where his bridges to nowhere
should go.</i>

13:58.172 --> 14:00.039
<i>Where's the end of this thing?</i>

14:00.107 --> 14:03.376
<i>Oh, right there!</i>

14:03.444 --> 14:05.377
<i>But out here on my private property,</i>

14:05.445 --> 14:08.580
<i>he can't tell me what to do
'cause he can't find me.</i>

14:08.648 --> 14:11.950
<i>Damn! It's the man!
Always got the cool stuff!</i>

14:12.018 --> 14:13.785
<i>But they'll never take me alive!</i>

14:13.853 --> 14:16.721
<i>See ya, guys! Buh-bye!</i>

14:20.293 --> 14:23.895
A little more unhinged
than usual, Mike?

14:23.963 --> 14:26.497
It's bureaucrats.
I can't--

14:26.565 --> 14:28.065
I just can't handle it.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.634
Look, Mike, I know
you're upset with the city,

14:30.702 --> 14:32.569
but now more than ever
it's time to invoke

14:32.637 --> 14:34.905
the bend-but-don't-break strategy.

14:34.973 --> 14:39.310
Another great slogan from
the famous philosopher <i>Sun Tzu.</i>

14:39.377 --> 14:41.045
Forget Sun Tzu.
I googled him.

14:41.112 --> 14:43.347
It turned out
that China lost a lot of wars

14:43.414 --> 14:45.448
after he wrote his books.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.988
Okay, up next is...
Michael Baxter.

14:52.056 --> 14:53.189
Good, good.
Okay, girls. Let's go. Go, go.

14:53.257 --> 14:55.992
Whew.
Eve, honey. Wait. Get up.

14:58.863 --> 15:01.063
Eve, honey. Get up.
What is she doing?

15:01.130 --> 15:05.600
Hold on. Tebowing.
Need all the help we can get.

15:05.668 --> 15:08.170
Okay, honey.
I think he heard you.

15:10.039 --> 15:13.375
Ahh. Here's a online petition
in support of our tree.

15:13.442 --> 15:15.677
Oh, well, good for you.
It is great to see

15:15.745 --> 15:18.212
a young person
showing some initiative,

15:18.280 --> 15:21.349
although it will have no bearing
on this process.

15:21.416 --> 15:23.251
So I wasted my time?

15:23.318 --> 15:25.920
No. No, not at all,
because I have a button here

15:25.988 --> 15:28.822
for you with a picture
of our state flower.

15:31.393 --> 15:32.825
It's all right. Come...
You. You...

15:32.894 --> 15:35.161
Go on.

15:35.229 --> 15:36.596
I'd like to read a passage
from a book

15:36.663 --> 15:39.866
that talks about the impact
of a single tree--

15:39.934 --> 15:42.135
"The Giving Tree"
by Shel Silverstein.

15:44.038 --> 15:46.373
Aha. And don't they cut down
that tree in the end?

15:48.975 --> 15:50.209
Withdrawn.

15:50.277 --> 15:52.211
Dad!

15:52.279 --> 15:53.445
What?
I never finished the book.

15:53.513 --> 15:55.147
I read. She always fell
asleep in bed.

15:55.215 --> 15:55.915
I don't even know how the book ends.

15:55.982 --> 15:57.682
I didn't mean to do--

15:57.750 --> 16:03.055
uh, your honor, uh, I have done
my own geotechnical soil survey.

16:03.123 --> 16:04.789
Ooh! Here we go.

16:04.856 --> 16:07.525
And, uh, in our yard, we are
dealing with the parent material

16:07.592 --> 16:10.494
of glacial outwash,
which is a coarser soil

16:10.562 --> 16:11.829
than glacial till.

16:11.897 --> 16:13.998
Now the health of our soil

16:14.066 --> 16:16.500
is greatly enhanced
by the roots of our trees.

16:16.568 --> 16:19.037
Hmm.
And each layer of soil is called a horizon,

16:19.104 --> 16:21.671
and I have conducted tests
at four different boring depths.

16:21.739 --> 16:23.974
Yes, boring depths.
Well, mission accomplished.

16:27.312 --> 16:29.846
Ma'am, the city takes no joy
in removing this tree,

16:29.914 --> 16:31.081
but if we made an exception here,

16:31.149 --> 16:32.349
we'd have to do it for everybody.

16:32.417 --> 16:33.951
Yeah. And then you know
what'd happen.

16:34.018 --> 16:37.486
Next thing you know, the city
would be covered in... trees.

16:39.356 --> 16:41.157
Unless you have anything else to add,

16:41.224 --> 16:44.961
we will be moving on
to Vivienne Wilson.

16:45.028 --> 16:47.330
Just a second, just a second.
What we're trying to get at here

16:47.397 --> 16:50.799
is we planted this tree shortly
after we moved in the house,

16:50.867 --> 16:52.233
so we--we picnicked under this tree,

16:52.301 --> 16:54.569
and my--my youngest daughter
here has broken

16:54.636 --> 16:56.071
a lot of bones
falling out of that tree,

16:56.138 --> 16:59.474
and--and my other two daughters
made out with the same boy

16:59.541 --> 17:00.675
under that tree.

17:02.511 --> 17:05.113
Not at the same time.
I didn't say at the same time.

17:05.181 --> 17:06.781
It makes me look bad.
I did it first. It doesn't--it doesn't--

17:06.848 --> 17:08.147
it doesn't matter.
That Borelli kid--

17:08.215 --> 17:11.185
- The point is...
- Yes?

17:11.252 --> 17:13.220
If you cut down that tree,
it's not cutting a tree down.

17:13.288 --> 17:16.857
It's like removing
a member of our family.

17:16.924 --> 17:19.226
Hmm. Well, thank you, Mr. Baxter.

17:19.294 --> 17:21.761
Your speech is very persuasive.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.869
Not persuasive enough, I guess.

17:32.139 --> 17:34.874
Hmm. But on the positive side,

17:34.941 --> 17:38.644
its gonna be a lot brighter
in my den.

17:41.780 --> 17:43.248
<i>♪</i>

17:43.316 --> 17:45.484
<i>Did Lady Gaga wear
a catcher's mitt on her head</i>

17:45.551 --> 17:47.052
<i>to a funeral?</i>

17:47.120 --> 17:48.553
<i>We've got the pictures.</i>

17:48.621 --> 17:51.890
<i>But first, how meeting
Kim Kardashian proved to be</i>

17:51.957 --> 17:55.760
<i>too much for one excitable fan
in Denver.</i>

17:55.828 --> 17:58.562
No. No, Shaun Robinson, no!

17:58.630 --> 18:01.232
<i>Yes! I'm going in to hug
Kim Kardashian, you guys!</i>

18:01.299 --> 18:04.001
<i>Oh, my God!
Wow. So sorry.</i>

18:04.069 --> 18:06.103
Wow.
<i>No, it's fine, it's fine.</i>

18:08.540 --> 18:10.774
Gosh, Mandy's been through a lot.

18:10.842 --> 18:12.208
We should watch upstairs
so her bummed-out attitude

18:12.276 --> 18:13.910
doesn't make us feel weird
for laughing.

18:13.977 --> 18:15.412
Let's go.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.787
Surprise.

18:26.723 --> 18:28.090
My angel.

18:28.158 --> 18:29.658
No, it's just me.

18:29.725 --> 18:30.592
And I brought a small film crew.

18:30.660 --> 18:32.627
Uh, oh, my God.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.397
You-- you're in my house.

18:35.465 --> 18:37.699
Well, my producer thought
it would make good TV

18:37.767 --> 18:39.435
if we locate the clumsy poet
from the mall

18:39.502 --> 18:40.436
so I can console her.

18:40.503 --> 18:42.737
Um, how did you find me?

18:42.805 --> 18:44.805
It wasn't hard.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.274
As my security was dragging you out,

18:46.341 --> 18:47.608
you were screaming, "hello!
Don't you know who I am?

18:47.676 --> 18:49.910
My father's Outdoor Man!"

18:49.978 --> 18:52.046
Oh, no.

18:52.114 --> 18:55.383
Um...
Are they filming right now?

18:55.451 --> 18:56.884
Who?

18:56.952 --> 18:58.819
What do you mean, who?
The...

18:58.887 --> 19:00.787
Oh, them?

19:00.854 --> 19:03.557
You stop noticing after a while.

19:03.624 --> 19:04.891
Oh. I'm totally not camera-ready.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.226
Oh, no, yes, you are.

19:06.294 --> 19:07.227
Are you kidding me,
with this skin of yours?

19:08.496 --> 19:10.697
Oh, my God.
I'm getting such a hit

19:10.764 --> 19:13.166
of what it must be like
to be your sister right now,

19:13.234 --> 19:14.968
and it is awesome.

19:15.035 --> 19:18.270
Well, hey. Life knocks us all
down every once in a while,

19:18.338 --> 19:19.771
but it's what you do
when you get back up

19:19.839 --> 19:21.440
that really matters.

19:21.508 --> 19:22.508
Come here.

19:22.576 --> 19:25.377
I love you so much.

19:31.218 --> 19:32.817
You're gonna be fine.

19:32.884 --> 19:34.219
Well, you don't understand
what I've been through.

19:34.286 --> 19:35.920
I-I've been publicly humiliated.

19:35.988 --> 19:37.188
Do you even know what's that like?

19:42.060 --> 19:44.662
When I feel like
I'm the butt of the joke,

19:44.730 --> 19:46.063
you know what gives me strength?

19:46.132 --> 19:47.599
A silk bag full of money?

19:47.666 --> 19:49.433
Sometimes.

19:51.002 --> 19:53.403
But it's family.
They'll always be there for you,

19:53.471 --> 19:56.006
and you always have
to be there for them.

19:56.073 --> 19:58.208
You're so wise.

19:58.276 --> 20:01.545
You got that, right?

20:01.613 --> 20:03.380
Well, Fandy,
it was <i>so</i> nice meeting you.

20:03.448 --> 20:04.480
Oh, my God. You, too.

20:04.548 --> 20:06.149
If you ever come to California,

20:06.216 --> 20:08.117
you have to come see me.

20:08.185 --> 20:09.385
Oh, my God. That's amazing.
Can I get your number?

20:09.453 --> 20:10.886
Okay, then. See you soon.

20:10.954 --> 20:12.688
Okay! Bye, guys.

20:12.756 --> 20:16.225
See you soon!
See you in California!

20:18.495 --> 20:20.662
Wow, honey, why are you so happy?

20:20.729 --> 20:23.365
- Because I love my family so much.
- Oh.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.267
And it took an angel
to teach me that.

20:25.334 --> 20:27.235
Mandy, honey?

20:27.303 --> 20:30.539
Mandy, get back here!
Are your pupils dilated?

20:37.753 --> 20:39.480
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

20:39.547 --> 20:40.547
- Hey.
- Hey, dad.

20:40.615 --> 20:41.882
- Oh.
- What's that?

20:41.949 --> 20:43.783
Well, according to city code 57-15,

20:43.851 --> 20:47.221
this is, in fact, a tree.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.823
This is a little baby black Walnut,

20:49.891 --> 20:51.825
and we're gonna plant this
right out in front of the house.

20:51.893 --> 20:53.093
Aw.

20:53.161 --> 20:54.860
Oh, now, now, now don't
get all excited.

20:54.928 --> 20:56.429
It's gonna be a long time
before any of you

20:56.497 --> 20:59.232
can kiss a boy under that tree.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.902
Yeah, next time,
make it a different boy.

21:02.969 --> 21:04.404
I did it first.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.305
- I did it better.
- Guys!

21:06.373 --> 21:08.074
Wow.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.842
Do you realize dad is right here?

21:12.478 --> 21:14.012
Listen, here's the situation.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.448
We may have lost this battle,
but we didn't lose our spirit.

21:16.516 --> 21:17.749
Yeah.
So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna plant

21:17.816 --> 21:19.551
this little baby
out in front of the house,

21:19.618 --> 21:21.520
- and if the man comes out here and dares to cut this down...
- Mm?

21:21.587 --> 21:23.821
What we're gonna do--we're gonna
just plant another one.

21:23.889 --> 21:26.123
If he comes back a second time,
you're on your own,

21:26.191 --> 21:28.559
because literally, it's just a tree,

21:28.626 --> 21:31.028
and I got stuff to do.
