WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:07.107
Cheryl,
when did we start this
two-vegetable thing?

00:09.541 --> 00:13.211
It's peas and carrots.
It counts as one.

00:13.244 --> 00:15.714
So I guess that means
pie and ice cream
counts as one dessert?

00:15.747 --> 00:18.150
Oh...

00:15.747 --> 00:18.150
GIRLS: Yay!

00:18.184 --> 00:20.253
Okay, so I haven't
run this by
Reverend Pierson yet,

00:20.286 --> 00:22.655
but that's the layout
for the bingo tables.
What do you think?

00:22.687 --> 00:25.123
You know, I think these
tables near the entrance
look a little crowded.

00:25.157 --> 00:26.792
Yeah, just looking
for blind support here.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.829
Oh, then I love it.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.829
Oh, good.

00:29.861 --> 00:32.397
Jeez, enough with
the bingo talk.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.799
Every night for
the last two weeks,

00:33.832 --> 00:35.768
all I've been hearing
about is bingo night.

00:35.801 --> 00:39.138
Can't we just
have some civilized
dinner conversation?

00:39.170 --> 00:42.042
All right, Jim.
Read any good
books lately?

00:43.776 --> 00:46.312
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:46.344 --> 00:49.314
Well, you know, Dana,
I've been busy raising
a family.

00:49.347 --> 00:52.251
But don't worry, honey.
Maybe you'll meet
your husband in a book.

00:54.185 --> 00:55.454
All right,
you girls are done.

00:55.487 --> 00:58.290
You're too mature
for this conversation.

00:58.323 --> 00:59.725
Can we watch TV?

00:59.758 --> 01:01.359
Sure. Go ahead.

01:01.393 --> 01:04.162
Oh, Jim, no, no, no.
They're watching
too much TV.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.132
Yeah. You're right.

01:06.165 --> 01:08.234
Hey, girls,
put in a video game.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.237
So, Jim, do you mind
coming down early

01:12.271 --> 01:13.739
and helping me set up
the bingo tables
at church?

01:15.206 --> 01:17.342
You know,
big white building,
cross on top?

01:18.811 --> 01:21.814
No way. I am not going
to bingo night.

01:21.846 --> 01:24.583
Jim! Come on,
it's to raise money
for the church.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.519
Whatever happened
to "do unto others"?

01:26.552 --> 01:28.554
Cheryl, for everyone
to do unto others,

01:28.587 --> 01:32.625
there's got to be some
guy to be done unto.
I'm that guy!

01:32.658 --> 01:35.727
Oh, did I tell you
the grand prize is
a king-sized waterbed?

01:35.760 --> 01:36.896
(GASPS)

01:36.929 --> 01:38.564
You're kidding!

01:39.364 --> 01:41.433
I love waterbeds!

01:41.466 --> 01:43.201
I'm gonna win
that waterbed,
Cheryl.

01:43.234 --> 01:44.804
I'm gonna win that waterbed.
I'm gonna win it.

01:43.234 --> 01:44.804
No, no. Jim!

01:44.837 --> 01:47.305
I love our bed.
I don't want to
give up our mattress.

01:47.338 --> 01:49.275
To be fair,
she's already
given up her career,

01:49.308 --> 01:51.243
her ambition
and her dignity.

01:53.512 --> 01:56.382
Cheryl, don't you see
that this waterbed is
a sign from God?

01:56.415 --> 02:01.754
He's saying,
"My son walked on water.
Jim, you must sleep on it."

02:01.787 --> 02:03.422
I thought you weren't
even going to bingo night.

02:03.454 --> 02:04.789
Oh, that's that thing we do.

02:04.822 --> 02:07.292
You know, you always
want to do something

02:07.325 --> 02:10.794
that I don't want to do,
then you convince me.
It's fun!

02:10.829 --> 02:12.230
Go ahead,
let's do it again.

02:12.264 --> 02:13.633
Okay. Let's do the dishes.

02:13.665 --> 02:15.268
I don't want to.

02:24.842 --> 02:26.545
JIM: <i> Oh, baby!</i>

02:33.718 --> 02:35.420
<i> Thank you,
 Reverend Pierson.</i>

02:35.454 --> 02:37.590
<i> Oh, this one
 is so much fun!</i>

02:37.622 --> 02:41.927
<i> Okay, in the "B"
 column, people,
 it's B-4!</i>

02:41.961 --> 02:43.596
ALL: And after!

02:45.364 --> 02:48.501
And after we're
done here tonight,

02:48.533 --> 02:52.538
and B-4 we C-2 the...

02:54.907 --> 02:56.643
I don't know where
I'm going with this.
I'm sorry.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.579
Look, uh, if you want
to see heaven,

02:59.611 --> 03:00.812
cough up the green,
okay?

03:02.681 --> 03:05.718
Hey, you want to buy
a homemade cupcake?
Fifty cents.

03:06.685 --> 03:08.687
Oh, come on,
they're made with love.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.258
Butthead.

03:13.692 --> 03:17.362
Jim, what do you think
of my cupcakes?

03:17.395 --> 03:19.798
Well, they've held up
real nice with three
kids and all.

03:26.872 --> 03:28.975
<i> B-7. B-7.</i>

03:29.008 --> 03:31.510
B-7. Yeah, B-7's great.

03:31.543 --> 03:33.945
If this was 10 freakin'
minutes ago!

03:33.979 --> 03:36.482
Andy.

03:33.979 --> 03:36.482
Andy, would you
keep it down?

03:36.514 --> 03:38.416
Get lost!

03:38.449 --> 03:41.686
It's bad luck having
a dame eyeballing
your cards.

03:41.719 --> 03:42.955
Ah! Not the
church pinch!

03:42.987 --> 03:44.223
I'll be good!
I'll be good!

03:45.591 --> 03:48.861
<i> I-22. I-22.</i>

03:48.894 --> 03:51.730
I missed
the last number.
What was it?

03:52.698 --> 03:53.766
I-22.

03:54.432 --> 03:55.668
What?

03:55.700 --> 03:59.239
(ENUNCIATING) I-22.

04:00.538 --> 04:02.375
Thank you.

04:00.538 --> 04:02.375
Here. Here.

04:02.807 --> 04:05.010
I-22.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.812
There.

04:06.844 --> 04:08.848
Thank you.

04:06.844 --> 04:08.848
You're welcome.

04:10.014 --> 04:12.350
You remind me
of my husband.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.387
He had a beautiful voice.

04:16.487 --> 04:18.490
I slept with
Jack Kerouac.

04:25.898 --> 04:26.732
Bingo!

04:26.766 --> 04:29.502
Bingo! We have a bingo.
Hold all cards.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.037
Crap!

04:31.069 --> 04:33.471
There goes dinner for two
at the Rusty Schooner.

04:33.504 --> 04:36.375
Come on, Andyman,
you're better than this!

04:37.076 --> 04:38.811
<i> All right, bingo buddies,</i>

04:38.843 --> 04:41.713
<i> it's time for the
 grand prize game!</i>

04:41.747 --> 04:43.415
This is it!
This is it!

04:44.682 --> 04:46.052
<i> Well, Dana...</i>

04:46.918 --> 04:48.019
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)

04:48.052 --> 04:50.889
<i> Feast your eyes
 on this.</i>

04:50.923 --> 04:55.026
<i> It's a king-sized

 Swifty the Bed-czar.</i>

 in comfort is a sin,</i>

05:06.838 --> 05:10.410

05:19.817 --> 05:25.358
<i> So, let's get it on!</i>

05:25.391 --> 05:29.595
Um, that was supposed
to be my part, Reverend,
but, uh, okay.

05:31.129 --> 05:32.932
Get out of my way,
Andyman,

05:32.964 --> 05:34.566
because I'm going
to win that bed!

05:34.600 --> 05:35.935
I'm gonna win it!
I'm gonna win it!

05:35.968 --> 05:37.670
Hey, hey, if you do,
can I have your old one?

05:37.702 --> 05:40.439
The one that your sister
and I conceived three
children on? Sure.

05:43.574 --> 05:45.577
I'll stick
with the futon.

05:46.845 --> 05:48.681
<i> B-6. B-6.</i>

05:51.750 --> 05:54.420

05:59.891 --> 06:01.993

06:08.132 --> 06:09.468
O-67.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.039
Here.

06:38.629 --> 06:39.463
Bingo!

06:39.497 --> 06:41.867
Bingo! We have a bingo!
Hold all cards!

06:41.899 --> 06:42.935
JIM: Bingo!

06:42.968 --> 06:48.007
<i> â™ª B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O

06:49.507 --> 06:50.709

06:50.742 --> 06:53.513
<i> â™ª B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O â™ª</i>

06:57.783 --> 06:59.752
Oh, Jim,
what a pleasure
to see you.

06:59.785 --> 07:00.953
Yeah, Cheryl's
not with me.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.087
Oh, good. It's so hard
to keep up the facade.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.722
Yeah.

07:04.755 --> 07:06.491
So, uh, why don't you
fork over that waterbed,

07:06.524 --> 07:08.460
and I'll be
out of your hair
until Christmas?

07:09.093 --> 07:10.762
Uh, yeah.

07:10.795 --> 07:17.036
Um, you know, Jim,
many religions believe
in a omnipresent God.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.638
Whoa.
Okay, look, I didn't come
all the way down to church

07:19.670 --> 07:22.141
to be lectured
by some minister
about God.

07:25.276 --> 07:28.781
For instance,
some Hasidic Jews
believe that

07:28.814 --> 07:32.718
reality is a dream
that God has conjured,

07:32.750 --> 07:34.719
and therefore
God sees all

07:34.752 --> 07:36.955
and knows all
because he is all.

07:36.988 --> 07:38.823
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:38.857 --> 07:42.795
You got an altar boy
or something that can
help me move this waterbed?

07:42.827 --> 07:46.264
(CHUCKLING) Jim,
what I'm trying
to tell you

07:46.298 --> 07:49.935
is that God
is always watching.

07:51.702 --> 07:55.474
And sometimes,
so am I.

08:01.846 --> 08:04.082
A hidden camera
in a church?

08:04.115 --> 08:05.750
I know. You wouldn't
know it to look at me,

08:05.783 --> 08:08.788
but I'm actually quite
a bit of a techno-geek.

08:09.887 --> 08:11.757
All right,
what are you going to do?

08:11.790 --> 08:14.760
Me? I'm not going
to do anything.

08:14.793 --> 08:18.096
No, your conscience,
over time, is going
to eat at you.

08:19.630 --> 08:22.133
Wow. That's heavy.

08:24.168 --> 08:27.171
I'm gonna be thinking
about that all night.

08:27.204 --> 08:31.109
I'll be tossing and turning
on my new waterbed!
Where is it?

08:31.142 --> 08:34.078
It's in the rec hall.
Go ahead. Go get it.
Enjoy yourself.

08:34.111 --> 08:39.150
Have a great time,
Jim. Just remember,
God is watching you.

08:40.284 --> 08:42.254
Well, after I get
this waterbed set up,

08:42.287 --> 08:44.222
he may want to
avert his eyes.

08:49.727 --> 08:51.596
(SLOSHING)

08:51.629 --> 08:54.933
Say, baby,
you wanna catch a wave?

08:56.701 --> 08:58.870
You see, honey,
that wasn't so bad.

08:58.903 --> 09:00.972
You went to church,
you helped a charity,

09:01.005 --> 09:03.041
and you got
a free waterbed.

09:03.075 --> 09:05.076
Yeah, yeah, nice recap.
Lose the top.

09:06.311 --> 09:07.780
(LAUGHING)

09:11.783 --> 09:13.019
(EXHALES)

09:14.653 --> 09:16.822
See anything
you like, sweets?

09:17.788 --> 09:18.823
(SCREAMING)

09:23.195 --> 09:24.196
(PANTING)

09:24.229 --> 09:25.931
CHERYL: Honey,
what's wrong?

09:25.964 --> 09:27.667
Nothing. Nothing.

09:30.335 --> 09:33.139
Cupcakes. 50 cents.

09:35.673 --> 09:37.108
No!

09:47.753 --> 09:48.887
Hey.

09:48.919 --> 09:49.988
Hey!

09:51.188 --> 09:52.357
You worked late
tonight, huh?

09:52.390 --> 09:54.759
Uh-huh. Yeah.

09:54.793 --> 09:56.394
I thought
you'd be asleep.

09:56.427 --> 09:58.697
Yeah, well, honey,
I waited up.

09:58.730 --> 10:02.401
I mean, we've had
this waterbed for
a few days now,

10:02.433 --> 10:05.605
and still haven't felt
the motion of the ocean.

10:10.075 --> 10:12.612
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

10:15.147 --> 10:16.616
I doubt it.

10:20.985 --> 10:23.923
All right.
What's with you lately?

10:25.389 --> 10:27.292
Nothing.
Everything's great.

10:27.325 --> 10:29.995
Totally normal.

10:30.028 --> 10:32.298
Jim, you're
eating my tofu.

10:35.866 --> 10:38.770
It's obviously
a cry for help.

10:38.803 --> 10:41.240
Come on,
something's wrong.

10:41.273 --> 10:42.274
Is it me?

10:43.408 --> 10:45.144
What?

10:45.177 --> 10:47.046
No, no, no, honey.

10:48.245 --> 10:49.814
Uh...

10:49.847 --> 10:52.984
Okay, I didn't know
how to tell you this,

10:53.018 --> 10:54.286
but I'm seeing
somebody else.

10:57.121 --> 10:58.189
What?

10:57.121 --> 10:58.189
Whoa, whoa!

10:58.222 --> 10:59.991
No, maybe that was
a bad choice of words.

11:00.024 --> 11:02.894
I mean,
when I look at you,

11:02.927 --> 11:05.029
I actually see
somebody else.

11:05.062 --> 11:08.133
Oh. Oh. What?

11:08.166 --> 11:11.170
At bingo,
I switched cards
with Old Lady Meier

11:11.202 --> 11:13.971
while she was asleep
and won the bed.

11:14.004 --> 11:18.342
And then
Reverend Pierson saw it
and ratted me out to God.

11:18.375 --> 11:22.980
And because of that,
when I try to
be with you,

11:23.014 --> 11:24.850
all I see is Pierson!

11:26.451 --> 11:28.721
You cheated at bingo?

11:28.754 --> 11:31.757
Big picture, Cheryl!
Get the big picture here!

11:32.356 --> 11:33.457
I...

11:33.491 --> 11:37.062
We've got to fix this curse
that Pierson has put on me.

11:37.095 --> 11:41.365
(CHUCKLING)
Jim, it's not a curse.
It's your conscience.

11:41.399 --> 11:44.269
I know. People
keep saying that,
but I don't buy it.

11:45.537 --> 11:47.406
Look, honey, there's
an easy fix for this,

11:47.438 --> 11:48.807
and I think you know
what it is.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.008
I know, I know.

11:50.041 --> 11:52.111
I thought about
a blindfold, but I'd
still feel the beard.

11:58.482 --> 11:59.517
Yes?

11:59.551 --> 12:01.987
Hi. You remember me?

12:02.019 --> 12:04.155
Yes! You helped me
with the bingo.

12:04.188 --> 12:05.524
Such a nice boy.

12:05.557 --> 12:08.259
Yes, thank you.
I ripped you off.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.096
You ripped me off?

12:11.129 --> 12:13.532
Oh, yeah.
He skinned you real good.

12:13.565 --> 12:15.768
JIM: Yeah. Yeah, I...

12:17.067 --> 12:19.004
Well, long story short,

12:19.870 --> 12:21.874
you won the waterbed,

12:21.907 --> 12:23.841
and here it is.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.110
Oh.

12:25.143 --> 12:27.479
I wouldn't have any
use for a waterbed.

12:27.511 --> 12:29.847
But you won it.
You have to take it.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.182
But I don't want it.

12:31.216 --> 12:33.085
But you have to take it.

12:33.118 --> 12:34.887
But I don't want it.

12:33.118 --> 12:34.887
But you have to take...

12:34.919 --> 12:37.155
All right, all right,
all right.

12:40.158 --> 12:44.529
Look, if you won't
take the waterbed,

12:44.562 --> 12:47.064
please, let me
pay you for it.

12:47.097 --> 12:48.800
Oh, I couldn't
take your money.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.802
Drop the act
and take the money.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.772
Get, get, get,
get, get!

12:55.039 --> 12:57.074
Look,

12:57.107 --> 13:00.512
please,
will you take the money?
It's important to me.

13:01.980 --> 13:05.149
Well, all right.

13:05.182 --> 13:06.918
How much is
a waterbed worth?

13:14.192 --> 13:16.895
Well, how much do you
think it's worth?

13:22.167 --> 13:24.168
Aunt Dana,
who's smarter,
boys or girls?

13:24.201 --> 13:26.270
Girls by a long shot.

13:26.303 --> 13:28.139
Daddy says boys
are smarter.

13:28.173 --> 13:30.975
That's because
he's a boy,
and he's stupid.

13:32.076 --> 13:34.145
Where's Cheryl?
Where's Cheryl?

13:34.178 --> 13:36.113
Daddy, Aunt Dana
says you're stupid.

13:36.147 --> 13:38.517
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Where's Cheryl?

13:38.549 --> 13:39.951
In the bedroom.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.519
Yes!

13:41.552 --> 13:43.254
Okay, okay, here.
Here, here.

13:43.288 --> 13:46.191
Uh, girls, Aunt Dana's
going to take you out
for some ice cream.

13:46.224 --> 13:48.160
Come on, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

13:46.224 --> 13:48.160
What?

13:48.192 --> 13:52.129
I need some alone time
with your sister.

13:52.163 --> 13:54.466
Oh, my God,
girls, let's go!
Move, move, move!

13:54.499 --> 13:55.933
What about our shoes?

13:55.966 --> 13:58.470
There's no time! Run!

13:58.503 --> 14:00.605
Cheryl, Cheryl, Cheryl!

13:58.503 --> 14:00.605
CHERYL: Yeah?

14:00.639 --> 14:03.908
I've done a good thing,
now let's do the bad thing!

14:03.942 --> 14:05.610
Ooh!

14:03.942 --> 14:05.610
What's the matter?

14:05.644 --> 14:07.479
You're not still seeing
Reverend Pierson, are you?

14:07.511 --> 14:08.580
Mmm-mmm.

14:10.381 --> 14:11.549
Finally.

14:13.051 --> 14:15.221
It feels like
it's been years.

14:19.157 --> 14:20.993
Ah, come on!

14:30.668 --> 14:32.170
(SINGING)

14:35.639 --> 14:37.609
Pierson! Pierson!
Listen to me!

14:37.642 --> 14:40.012
Hey, come on,
this is my private time!

14:40.044 --> 14:42.580
Yeah, yeah. Well, you can
have it back as soon as
you take that curse off

14:42.614 --> 14:44.917
that you and the guy
upstairs put on me!

14:44.950 --> 14:48.552
Jim, the man upstairs
is not in the business of
putting curses on people.

14:48.586 --> 14:50.990
Oh, yeah?
He makes zombies.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.692
Right, I forgot
about the zombies.

14:54.725 --> 14:58.163
Yeah, and now he's
got me seeing you and
Old Lady Meier in bed.

14:58.196 --> 15:01.066
In bed? No, I just
flirt with her!

15:04.369 --> 15:08.240
No, we need central air.
She's got deep pockets.

15:08.273 --> 15:09.942
I'm not talking
about that.

15:09.975 --> 15:12.110
Instead of seeing
my wife, I see you,

15:12.143 --> 15:13.711
and then I see
Old Lady Meier.

15:13.745 --> 15:17.283
And because of that,
I can't even look
at Cheryl.

15:18.515 --> 15:19.750
Jeez.

15:19.783 --> 15:22.955
Well, you know,
Jim, if you need me to
make love to your wife,

15:22.988 --> 15:24.589
just come out and say it.

15:24.621 --> 15:26.223
(LAUGHING)
That's a joke!

15:26.256 --> 15:29.660
Come on, I use
that in my couples
counseling session.

15:29.693 --> 15:31.429
It gets
a bigger laugh there.

15:31.462 --> 15:33.264
Okay.

15:33.298 --> 15:36.268
You know, Jim,
it kind of seems to me

15:36.301 --> 15:39.437
like maybe you're
having a little struggle
with your conscience.

15:39.471 --> 15:42.006
No, no, no, no.

15:42.039 --> 15:43.375
Look, I told Cheryl
the truth.

15:43.408 --> 15:44.710
Yeah.

15:44.743 --> 15:49.047
And I went to
Old Lady Meier's house,
and I paid her for the bed.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.549
I'm clean.

15:50.581 --> 15:52.985
(SIGHS) Jeez.
Wonder what the
problem is, then.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.586
I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

15:54.619 --> 15:56.355
Hmm.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.990
How much money
did you pay her?

15:59.024 --> 16:02.293
Well, I might have
given her a little
less than market value.

16:02.326 --> 16:03.562
Okay, how much?

16:03.595 --> 16:05.663
Fifteen bucks.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.663
Fifteen bucks?

16:05.697 --> 16:07.466
Well, I thought
she'd counter.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.768
She didn't even counter.

16:09.801 --> 16:12.571
Whoa, Jimbo,
you are in big need

16:12.604 --> 16:14.473
of a little talk
with God, my friend.

16:14.505 --> 16:16.674
Aw, come on.
Nobody does that anymore.

16:16.707 --> 16:18.642
Uh, you know something?
As a matter of fact,
they do, Jim.

16:18.676 --> 16:22.180
Otherwise I'd be
working at my dad's
shoe store, so...

16:22.212 --> 16:25.416
Uh, come on, sit down.
I'll get you started.
All right?

16:25.450 --> 16:26.785
Okay.

16:26.817 --> 16:28.086
God, Jim.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.121
Jim, God.

16:30.154 --> 16:31.222
Hey.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.360
Big fan.

16:35.793 --> 16:38.062
First-time caller,
long-time listener.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.469
You know,
you got God's ear.

16:44.501 --> 16:46.337
Let's get to
the point, okay?

16:48.105 --> 16:52.344
Well, I know that you
know the things that
I've done wrong.

16:52.376 --> 16:54.245
You're kind of like
Santa that way.

16:55.846 --> 16:57.081
(SIGHS)

16:57.115 --> 16:58.383
Did I do
"long-time listener..."

16:58.416 --> 16:59.718
Uh-huh, yes.

17:00.618 --> 17:02.354
Well, then, I'm out.

17:02.386 --> 17:05.156
Come on, hold on.
Hold it. Hold it.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.125
Why don't you try
listing the things

17:07.156 --> 17:10.227
that you think God
might find bad?

17:10.260 --> 17:12.829
You mean,
like cheating little
old ladies at bingo?

17:12.864 --> 17:15.133
Well, that's an excellent
example. Go on.

17:15.165 --> 17:16.768
And then low-balling them
after you cheated them?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.537
All right, Jim,
you're on a roll.
Keep going.

17:18.569 --> 17:22.240
And then flirting with
them to get central air
for the church?

17:22.271 --> 17:24.541
Okay, let's wrap
this up, shall we?

17:26.510 --> 17:30.449
Jim, come on.
I mean, you know
what you got to do.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.384
Don't you?

17:35.420 --> 17:37.756
Yeah, I should give
Old Lady Meier

17:38.623 --> 17:41.526
a fair price
for the bed.

17:41.558 --> 17:44.062
And maybe stop calling
her Old Lady Meier.

17:47.432 --> 17:49.634
Welly, welly, welly.
Look at you, mister.

17:53.371 --> 17:54.538
You feel better?

17:54.571 --> 17:56.140
Yeah, well...

17:57.275 --> 17:58.677
It was kind of painless,
I guess.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.712
Yeah, well, you know,
when God's not smiting
the wicked,

18:01.746 --> 18:03.849
she's a pretty good lady.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.319
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:12.824 --> 18:14.226
Thanks.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.826
Sure.

18:15.859 --> 18:17.228
So, I guess I'll see you
in church Sunday, huh?

18:17.261 --> 18:18.563
Nope.

18:17.261 --> 18:18.563
Great.

18:21.633 --> 18:24.635
(IMITATES CROWD SCREAMING)
Thank you! I'm back!

18:25.470 --> 18:26.837
Hello, Chicago!

18:26.871 --> 18:29.574
And God said,
"Let there be rock!"

18:29.606 --> 18:30.808
(SINGING)

18:33.545 --> 18:36.882
Reverend? I've got
to talk to you.

18:36.914 --> 18:38.517
I'm at a moral
crossroads, and...

18:38.549 --> 18:41.752
Jeez. You know, um,
bartenders love
to listen, too.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.525
Ah, come on.
I'm joking,
I'm joking.

18:46.557 --> 18:48.359
Come on in. Come on.

18:49.894 --> 18:52.364
So, after I sold
the waterbed,

18:52.396 --> 18:54.499
I went right over
to Old Lady...

18:54.531 --> 18:58.336
Mrs. Meier's house,
and I gave her the money.

18:58.368 --> 19:00.237
And that's it?
You didn't steal
any lawn ornaments

19:00.270 --> 19:01.572
on your way out
or anything?

19:01.605 --> 19:04.843
No. I was very good.

19:04.875 --> 19:08.747
She made me oatmeal
and told me stories
about the Great Depression.

19:08.779 --> 19:12.550
Let me tell you
something. That lady
does not like the Irish.

19:12.584 --> 19:15.921
See, honey?
Doesn't it feel good to
have a clear conscience?

19:15.953 --> 19:17.888
Yeah. Yeah, it does,

19:17.922 --> 19:19.758
even though
I was forced into it.

19:19.790 --> 19:21.625
(GROANS)

19:21.659 --> 19:24.462
You know, honey,
it is kind of a shame
we never got a chance

19:24.494 --> 19:25.896
to try out
that waterbed.

19:25.930 --> 19:28.333
Well, next time we're
over at Andy's house,

19:28.365 --> 19:30.568
we'll have to sneak
into his bedroom.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.237
You sold it to Andy?

19:32.269 --> 19:36.775
Yeah. What other sap
would pay my 10%
transaction fee?

19:36.807 --> 19:38.210
(LAUGHING)

19:42.747 --> 19:44.449
Kitty wanna play.

19:48.619 --> 19:49.787
(PURRS)

19:54.358 --> 19:55.394
Ah.

19:59.463 --> 20:00.665
Damn it!

20:01.465 --> 20:03.934
Cheryl, call Andy!

20:03.968 --> 20:05.971
Tell him
I'm on my way over!
