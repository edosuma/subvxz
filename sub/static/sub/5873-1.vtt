01:27.671 --> 01:30.971
You all right?

01:31.006 --> 01:33.267
Ron.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.896
Are you okay?

01:41.810 --> 01:44.438
How could somebody
do something like this?

01:46.481 --> 01:50.361
Some gruesome stuff.

01:50.396 --> 01:51.782
Yeah.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.791
And just one town away.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.126
Makes you wonder...

02:01.161 --> 02:03.874
What's next?

02:03.909 --> 02:05.171
Yeah.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.462
What is this?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.217
At least tell how it's gonna work.

02:51.797 --> 02:55.847
All you need to know
is the air will burn.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.638
The air will burn?

03:17.447 --> 03:21.702
- Trial number four,
absolute perfection.

03:21.737 --> 03:23.830
Yes!

03:26.498 --> 03:29.607
Perfection!

03:33.839 --> 03:36.058
Absolute perfection.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.207
I'm gonna get you!

04:06.114 --> 04:07.796
<i>' No'.!</i>

04:07.831 --> 04:12.712
- Ron, do you have to get the kids
all riled up right at bedtime?

04:12.747 --> 04:16.341
No, I don't have to.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.571
I just want to!

04:18.759 --> 04:21.182
Let's go, family prayer.

04:21.216 --> 04:23.606
Cindy, Jason, come on.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.108
Ron.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.994
<i>All right, Ron, your turn.</i>

04:44.117 --> 04:46.666
- I think we should have
Cindy say it tonight.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.543
You never say it anymore.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.389
I will another time.

05:01.718 --> 05:06.440
- Dear God, thank You
for everything in the world.

05:06.475 --> 05:08.857
Please keep us safe.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.568
Please bless our blessings.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.402
We ask that You
can watch over us,

05:14.437 --> 05:16.991
that we can be a good family.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.013
Did you get what you needed?

05:41.049 --> 05:44.019
- What did I tell you
about you and your questions?

05:50.267 --> 05:52.816
With liberty and justice

05:52.851 --> 05:54.277
for all.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.030
Very good, Rachel.

05:57.190 --> 06:02.742
All right, who can tell me what number
President Thomas Jefferson was?

06:02.777 --> 06:04.865
- Oh, me.
- I know!

06:04.900 --> 06:06.219
Jason?

06:06.254 --> 06:07.499
18?

06:07.534 --> 06:11.334
- No, Thomas Jefferson
was number three.

06:11.369 --> 06:13.752
- Oh, yeah,
that was my next guess.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.838
- All right, children,
show me you know what to do.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.182
Put the crayon down.
Come on.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.266
If it was an emergency,
you'd stay low and crawl.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.289
Hey, Max, this one for real?

06:33.324 --> 06:36.313
Oh, it just went off again.

06:36.348 --> 06:38.441
Stupid thing.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.995
Hey, Dorsie!

07:09.030 --> 07:10.937
Where's Penny?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.145
Out being a teenager!

07:16.686 --> 07:18.905
Come look at this.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.156
What?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.910
I'll get it in the morning.

07:28.945 --> 07:31.584
I ask you to do one thing.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.335
You keep this place running

07:33.370 --> 07:36.374
while I take care
of the important stuff.

07:36.409 --> 07:38.796
One thing!

08:09.739 --> 08:12.162
Cunningham, it's David.

08:12.197 --> 08:14.542
Yeah, I got your check.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.503
Your investments about to pay off.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.963
Get Parker,
be in Cokeville on the 15th.

08:19.998 --> 08:22.586
Here comes the biggie.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.075
Hey, what's up?

08:47.819 --> 08:49.992
I got to figure this out.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.035
I can't sit in there having everybody
tell me they got all the answers,

08:55.070 --> 08:59.336
when every piece of scum just
keeps giving me more questions.

08:59.371 --> 09:02.209
That body in the motel
last week...

09:03.376 --> 09:06.630
Where are the answers
for that guy?

09:12.302 --> 09:14.352
Love you, Dad.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.516
- That's just too much of a coincidence
to just be a coincidence,

09:17.551 --> 09:19.872
'cause I love you too.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.194
Love you, Cinderella.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.796
Penny, we're not leaving forever.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.801
- Yeah, well, however long it is,
it's gonna seem like forever.

09:44.836 --> 09:46.636
It's gonna be an adventure.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.595
- Does it bother you
that I'm going to help him?

09:55.630 --> 09:57.228
No, he's your brother.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.314
Yeah, I know.
You should go help him.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.728
Maybe it could give you some time
to think things through.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.861
Look, Claudia, I-

10:08.942 --> 10:11.034
I'm sorry.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.679
I want us to be a close family.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.247
Well, maybe you could start

10:16.282 --> 10:18.660
by saying family prayers
with us again.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.922
It's all the cop stuff
you see, isn't it?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.426
- I just have a hard time
saying those praying things

10:26.461 --> 10:27.964
when the world
I live in is filled with-

10:27.999 --> 10:31.262
- Mom!
- In a minute, honey!

10:31.297 --> 10:34.050
- It's already been
about a million minutes.

10:34.085 --> 10:36.769
We'll talk when I get back.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.308
I hope so.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.773
Love you, Dad.

10:41.808 --> 10:45.312
- That's just too much
of a coincidence.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.596
I forgot how pretty it is here.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.981
This'll be where we make our mark.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.603
- It smells like somebody
already made their mark.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.870
The dump?

11:42.905 --> 11:44.752
Really?

11:44.787 --> 11:48.712
We pull into town, and the first place
we hit is the dump?

11:48.747 --> 11:50.377
Cut him some slack, Penny.

11:50.412 --> 11:51.968
You know he's brilliant.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.677
He just needs us to support him.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.895
- Oh, look, he found us
an empty bottle.

12:00.930 --> 12:03.982
Yeah, he is brilliant.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.691
- Don't you think it's kind of weird
that he hasn't told us the deal?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.995
They're here.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.622
- David.
- Hey, David!

12:20.657 --> 12:22.034
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

12:24.702 --> 12:26.045
You got here okay?

12:26.080 --> 12:27.462
Oh, yeah.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.250
We're, uh, just excited
to get going.

12:30.285 --> 12:32.002
Yeah.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.505
Not long till you
see what you bought into.

12:35.540 --> 12:37.348
They gave you money?

12:42.887 --> 12:46.107
- Come on, David,
we're like kids at Christmas here.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.021
- I'll tell you what] am ready
to let you in on.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.741
I did it.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.696
I've proven mathematically
how I can die and come back to life.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.498
That is just fantastic.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.807
He's been working on that for hours.

13:06.842 --> 13:10.339
Yeah, that's really great, David.

13:10.374 --> 13:13.836
But, anyways,
what's your big idea?

13:15.712 --> 13:18.137
- Now, you're going to have
to wait till tomorrow

13:18.172 --> 13:22.348
for the full business plan,
but for today, here's just a taste.

13:22.383 --> 13:23.768
We're good with that.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.938
- You ready, Dorsie?
- Yep.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.396
You ready to see this, boys?

13:29.431 --> 13:31.110
- Uh-huh.
- Let's see it.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.285
Ready?

13:43.614 --> 13:44.581
No!

13:47.577 --> 13:49.045
Whoa! Whoa.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.290
The air will burn.

13:51.325 --> 13:53.047
<i>Whoa'.!</i>

13:53.082 --> 13:55.964
- Now, just imagine
that times a billion, huh?

13:55.999 --> 13:58.846
- So what, are we going
in the firework business?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.555
- That's a good way
of looking at it, boys.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.343
Fireworks is gonna take us
into the brave new world.

14:03.378 --> 14:04.642
I told you.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.436
He's one of the smartest guys
I've ever known.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.315
- Did you see that?
We're going into the fireworks business.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.041
All the way to the top.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.515
That can thing part of the biggie?

14:53.184 --> 14:56.529
- David, I got to tell you,
I am excited.

14:56.564 --> 14:58.654
Big day.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.490
So what's with the painted windows?

15:00.525 --> 15:03.369
- I bet he's got to keep it cool
for the fireworks.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.577
- Hey, thanks for everything.
- Anytime.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.083
When's Dad get home?

15:17.118 --> 15:18.674
This afternoon.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.694
Are you all ready for your test?

15:20.729 --> 15:22.952
- Yep, for sure.
- Oh, good.

15:22.987 --> 15:25.139
So you know all about Wyoming?

15:25.174 --> 15:28.519
Okay, what is the capital of Wyoming?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.268
. Easy.?

15:31.303 --> 15:32.897
It's W.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.313
Jason.

15:35.348 --> 15:37.695
- Got to go, Mom.
- Love you.

15:37.730 --> 15:38.736
Love you.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.149
Be safe at school!

15:42.650 --> 15:44.402
Pull over right here.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.214
This...

15:58.666 --> 16:01.857
This is the day we lead people
into the brave new world.

16:01.892 --> 16:05.012
Our enforcer has been outfitted
with five blast caps

16:05.047 --> 16:10.304
placed in cans filled
with gunpowder, aluminum dust, flour,

16:10.339 --> 16:13.898
and it will explode
in the air like confetti.

16:13.933 --> 16:16.645
The gas will explode
on a delayed fuse,

16:16.680 --> 16:19.358
Which will ignite
the particles in the air,

16:19.393 --> 16:22.113
and the air will bum.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.573
Walls will collapse,
and everybody inside

16:25.608 --> 16:29.368
will immediately move as reincarnate

16:29.403 --> 16:31.786
to a world I preside over.

16:31.821 --> 16:33.332
Hold on.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.165
What walls collapse?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.044
Who's inside?

16:37.079 --> 16:40.173
The chosen ones.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.461
The children
of Cokeville Elementary School.

16:43.995 --> 16:45.386
No, really.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.472
What's the plan?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.599
This is a religious community.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.934
They'll do whatever it takes
to get their children back.

16:52.969 --> 16:54.270
No, really.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.246
What's the plan?

16:56.281 --> 16:58.149
This is the plan.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.731
Blowing up little kids is the plan?

16:59.766 --> 17:01.900
It's a good plan.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.032
12-4 to base.

17:12.068 --> 17:13.789
Go for base.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.708
Yeah, Nadene, anything going on?

17:15.742 --> 17:17.292
Well, with you two cops out of town,

17:17.328 --> 17:19.126
I can finally get
some work done around here.

17:19.161 --> 17:21.714
10-4.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.417
Come in!

17:40.452 --> 17:41.901
Come in!

17:44.957 --> 17:47.865
They're going back in.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.744
The biggie's about to happen.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.457
Daddy, what are you gonna do?

18:22.492 --> 18:25.483
You just do as you're told.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.950
You ready?

18:43.706 --> 18:46.215
David, does this have anything to do

18:46.250 --> 18:48.218
with when you
were the town marshal here?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.973
The air will burn.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.309
I'll be back in about an hour.

19:27.458 --> 19:31.383
- One more mess-up,
and I'll shoot you.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.541
Hello.

20:43.576 --> 20:47.171
- Miss Cook, we're holding
the school hostage.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.103
Don't push any alarms.

20:49.138 --> 20:50.965
Don't call for help.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.982
We have guns, and this is a bomb.

20:54.017 --> 20:56.929
I need just pull this trigger,

20:56.964 --> 20:59.183
and this building,
with everybody inside of it,

20:59.218 --> 21:02.226
will be blown sky high.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.185
Try and hit me over the head
or anything like that,

21:05.220 --> 21:08.560
and I will pull this trigger
when I go down.

21:08.595 --> 21:11.733
Do I make myself clear, Miss Cook?

21:12.980 --> 21:15.114
Stop!

21:15.149 --> 21:17.743
Get over here.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.222
Get over here!

21:23.257 --> 21:25.541
Are you crazy?

21:25.576 --> 21:29.331
I can't believe you would do this
to little kids!

21:29.366 --> 21:32.129
I am not going to do this.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.473
Keys.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.562
Get out of here!

21:54.230 --> 21:58.030
You're no daughter of mine,
no daughter of mine!

22:04.156 --> 22:05.998
It was so tempting

22:06.033 --> 22:09.043
that Goldilocks
set about helping herself.

22:09.078 --> 22:13.208
First she tried a spoonful
from Papa Bear's great, big bowl.

22:13.243 --> 22:15.380
"Ow! " she yelled.
"Too hot!"

22:16.627 --> 22:20.882
Next, she tried a spoonful from
Mama Bear's medium-sized bowl.

22:20.917 --> 22:24.016
"Brr, too cold. "

22:24.051 --> 22:29.182
Finally, Goldilocks tried a spoonful
from Baby Bear's tiny, little-

22:32.560 --> 22:35.063
What exactly are you doing here?

22:35.098 --> 22:37.404
Quiet, lady.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.191
You've got to be joking.

22:39.226 --> 22:40.407
This is my room.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.951
No, this is my room.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.159
Now sit down and shut up.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.907
- Follow me.
I have a surprise for you.

23:23.942 --> 23:25.621
What kind of a surprise?

23:25.656 --> 23:28.332
Come and see.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.295
- Is it a birthday?
- Yeah.

23:34.330 --> 23:38.460
Come to room 4
for a special surprise in room 4.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.717
Come on.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.311
Carson, wait for Mommy!

23:50.346 --> 23:53.099
Sweetie, Mommy will be
right back, okay?

23:57.937 --> 24:01.157
- Good. Come right on in.
Thank you.

24:01.192 --> 24:03.822
- Hi, Ashton.
- Sit down.

24:03.857 --> 24:05.326
Hello, hello, hello.

24:05.361 --> 24:08.114
Thank you.
Come right in.

24:09.031 --> 24:09.998
Come in.

24:15.996 --> 24:19.421
- What is this?
- Sit down, please.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.466
Hello, thank you.

24:23.501 --> 24:25.554
Welcome.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.889
Go to the back.
Sit down. Be quiet.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.287
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, Gracie.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.416
- Do you know where
Carson's class is?

24:52.451 --> 24:54.708
Urn...

24:54.743 --> 24:57.226
they might be in room 4.

24:57.261 --> 24:59.280
Okay, let's go to room 4.

24:59.315 --> 25:01.300
How you doing, Pal?

25:05.164 --> 25:07.548
There's your friends.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.229
Come in.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.062
Oh, no, I've got to go.

25:17.097 --> 25:20.106
No. Come in.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.973
You may want to stay.

25:33.008 --> 25:35.125
We have a problem here.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.548
What's going on?

25:53.218 --> 25:56.472
- Help me! Help!
Help, please, somebody!

25:56.507 --> 25:58.395
Somebody, I need some help!

25:58.430 --> 25:59.857
Please, please, some-

25:59.892 --> 26:01.940
Please, I need to talk
to a police officer!

26:01.975 --> 26:03.402
This is very important.

26:03.437 --> 26:04.859
- There's no officers here right now,
but I can help you.

26:04.894 --> 26:06.196
Please, you need to listen to me!

26:06.231 --> 26:09.326
Something very bad is gonna happen
if we don't talk to the police!

26:09.361 --> 26:11.366
No, listen to me.
I need to talk to the police.

26:11.401 --> 26:12.619
What is wrong with you?

26:12.654 --> 26:14.952
Why won't you get me
a police officer?

26:14.987 --> 26:16.495
Miss, what's the trouble?

26:16.530 --> 26:17.541
Listen to me.

26:17.576 --> 26:21.206
My dad has a bomb,
and he's gonna blow up the school.

26:22.956 --> 26:26.711
If you don't believe me,
come out to my van!

26:34.093 --> 26:35.949
- Hey, we didn't know
what he was gonna do!

26:35.984 --> 26:37.805
- He's gone crazy!
He used to be real smart.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.530
<i>' Tina?</i>

26:59.615 --> 27:01.419
These are all mine.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.289
Missiles ahoy.

27:03.324 --> 27:05.089
Here I come.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.673
Beep, beep, beep.

27:12.934 --> 27:15.789
What's going on here?

27:15.824 --> 27:18.602
Are you the principal?

27:18.637 --> 27:21.436
- Yes, I'm the principal.
What's going on here?

27:22.683 --> 27:26.654
This is what's going on here.

27:28.272 --> 27:29.696
David Young?

27:29.731 --> 27:33.656
- Just your old town marshal
here for a friendly visit.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.919
- Barn, bam, bam, bam, bam,
ham, barn, barn, barn, barn, barn.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.338
Yes, sir.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.298
What is it you want?

27:48.333 --> 27:51.758
- Bam, bam,
barn, ham, bam, barn, barn, bam.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.222
<i>' Shut</i>

27:55.257 --> 27:58.934
I am sick and tired of all this noise!

27:58.969 --> 28:02.599
This is the most important day
of my life,

28:02.634 --> 28:04.191
of our lives!

28:07.769 --> 28:10.943
So shut up and let me focus.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.173
And give me some space!

28:24.328 --> 28:28.754
I want you to go back to your office.

28:28.789 --> 28:30.674
Call the authorities.

28:30.709 --> 28:35.590
Tell them I want $2 million
for each child.

28:37.883 --> 28:42.810
Tell them I'm prepared to stay here
for ten days,

28:42.845 --> 28:44.602
if necessary.

28:46.016 --> 28:49.771
It might take Congress that long
to raise all that money.

28:49.806 --> 28:52.398
And if you're not back in 15 minutes...

28:56.151 --> 28:58.176
I'm gonna start shooting...

28:58.211 --> 29:00.201
Shooting.

29:00.236 --> 29:04.293
One by one.

29:05.244 --> 29:10.000
Anybody runs out, I shoot a kid.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.685
Listen, kids, do as you're told.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.102
Keep quiet.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.139
Everything will be all right.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.652
Max...

29:31.687 --> 29:34.987
it's gonna be
a brave new world.

29:39.152 --> 29:42.114
Max, the brave new world

29:42.149 --> 29:45.076
is basically the idea
of reincarnation.

29:45.111 --> 29:46.208
Hey!

29:46.243 --> 29:48.837
Let the authorities know.

29:51.707 --> 29:55.803
- Kids, this is an experience
you'll all tell your children

29:55.838 --> 29:59.012
and your grandchildren all about.

29:59.047 --> 30:03.473
So let's get out
some paper and crayons,

30:03.508 --> 30:05.846
and it'll all be nice in here.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.610
- Nadene, there's a mad man
here at the elementary school.

30:15.645 --> 30:16.863
He's got a-
- We know.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.321
- We've been notified.
- How could you know?

30:36.251 --> 30:39.886
- Teachers, we need
each of you to count up

30:39.921 --> 30:43.175
how many children you each have
from each of your classrooms.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.437
Yes?

30:48.472 --> 30:50.770
- You're not supposed
to say the same word so many times

30:50.805 --> 30:52.109
in a sentence.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.194
"Each. "

30:56.229 --> 31:00.484
You said "each" three times
in the same sentence.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.134
I have 18.

31:22.169 --> 31:23.672
10.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.140
15.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.927
- 14.
- 15.

31:26.962 --> 31:28.554
12.

31:28.589 --> 31:30.103
14.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.482
That's 98.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.152
That's right.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.152
Base to 12-4.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.784
Base to 12-4?

31:43.819 --> 31:46.789
Ron, we have a situation
down at the elementary school.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.621
Base to 12-4.

32:04.798 --> 32:09.520
- Hey, mister,
I was looking at your guns.

32:09.555 --> 32:10.977
Pretty cool guns,

32:11.012 --> 32:15.188
but why didn't you get an AK-47?

32:15.223 --> 32:18.819
AK-47?

32:18.854 --> 32:20.856
That would be illegal.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.687
- How long do you plan
on being here for?

32:39.722 --> 32:43.254
- I don't know.
Two days, three, ten?

32:43.289 --> 32:45.011
Excuse me, ma'am.

32:45.046 --> 32:48.156
Um, I left my baby in the car,

32:48.191 --> 32:50.835
and I need to go out and get her.

32:50.870 --> 32:53.437
You left your baby in the car?

32:53.472 --> 32:56.271
- I know, I know. I thought
I was gonna be just a second.

32:56.306 --> 32:57.441
Let me tell you something.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.777
You never leave a child like that.

33:00.812 --> 33:05.613
- Please, just let me go get her,
and I'll bring her right back in here.

33:05.648 --> 33:07.409
I promise.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.742
You're not going anywhere.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.247
Are you a mother?

33:12.282 --> 33:15.265
Because if you were, you would unders-
- Sit down.

33:15.300 --> 33:18.248
- Please, just can we just talk and-
- Sit down!

33:24.920 --> 33:26.595
- Like a brave new world-
- Okay, all right.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.678
- He told us we were gonna start
a fireworks business.

33:29.591 --> 33:32.140
- Nadene, you better start
calling some parents.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.277
Hello?

34:00.866 --> 34:01.797
Hello?

34:02.958 --> 34:06.838
Glenna, the kids are in trouble.

34:06.873 --> 34:09.679
What kind of trouble?

34:23.478 --> 34:26.071
- She has no one
to take care of her.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.734
- I don't even think
she has a kid in the car.

34:28.768 --> 34:31.953
- Excuse me again.
I, uh...

34:31.987 --> 34:33.870
I was just thinking,

34:33.905 --> 34:37.125
maybe you could send
somebody else to go get her?

34:37.159 --> 34:38.664
No.

34:40.704 --> 34:43.924
- Okay, well, then could you
just go get her?

34:43.958 --> 34:45.799
Please?

34:45.833 --> 34:48.337
She's my baby.

34:51.047 --> 34:54.224
Thank you.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.136
It's a gold sedan,
and it's parked in the drop-off,

34:56.170 --> 34:58.138
and she's in a car seat.

35:00.724 --> 35:03.733
- Hey!
- Shh.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.360
- I want you to stack
some tables and chairs

35:05.395 --> 35:09.116
and make a barricade
so nobody can go through there.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.429
Why can't we just shut the door?

35:14.464 --> 35:17.082
'Cause the bathrooms right there.

35:17.117 --> 35:19.121
Kids.
Bathroom.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.047
- Nadene, I've got to get
a truck over there right now.

35:32.082 --> 35:34.611
You better let the clergy know too.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.267
Hello?

35:45.602 --> 35:48.105
At our school?

35:58.073 --> 35:59.623
Oh, it's all right.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.081
It's okay, it's okay.
Come here.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.683
Get that off.

36:03.718 --> 36:05.796
You come with me?

36:05.831 --> 36:07.839
Big jump. Come on.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.253
Your mommy was bad.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.640
Verlene...

36:16.675 --> 36:19.269
I've read about this kind of thing.

36:19.304 --> 36:21.978
If he starts to sweat,

36:22.013 --> 36:25.187
that's when we're in real trouble.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.778
We can't just sit here.

36:32.813 --> 36:35.076
We've got to do something.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.045
Oh.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.917
Give her to me.

36:48.952 --> 36:50.715
Oh, sweetie.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.252
Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

36:52.287 --> 36:54.302
You're okay.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.385
I'm sorry I left you.

37:24.117 --> 37:25.915
Mr. Young?

37:27.454 --> 37:32.176
The children are getting sick
from the smell of gas.

37:32.211 --> 37:34.511
Can we take it out of here?

37:37.547 --> 37:40.141
Can we at least open the windows?

37:44.304 --> 37:47.415
Look, this could cause you real trouble

37:47.450 --> 37:50.527
as more and more
of these kids get sick.

37:52.353 --> 37:56.199
At least for now,
they're doing what they're told,

37:56.234 --> 37:58.319
but if they all get sick...

37:59.903 --> 38:01.701
<i>Do it.</i>

38:04.407 --> 38:08.537
But listen, don't you try nothing.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.063
These children are precious.

38:12.098 --> 38:14.339
I'll only shoot them with a .22.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.347
This is a .45.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.635
This is for the teachers.

38:25.220 --> 38:29.646
Your lives don't mean a thing to me.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.039
And your principals
got one minute to get back,

38:44.074 --> 38:46.203
or I start shooting.

38:59.212 --> 39:02.432
- The way he's got this bomb triggered,
I don't know what to do.

39:02.467 --> 39:05.267
- What do you think he wants?
- I don't know what he wants.

39:05.302 --> 39:07.262
I don't know if he knows what he wants.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.735
One minute he's talking
about wanting money.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.445
The next he's ranting about this bomb
creating his brave new world.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.566
What's that?

39:20.567 --> 39:24.071
- Ben said it's something
to do with reincarnation.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.119
Got to go.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.056
I'm here! I'm here!

39:45.174 --> 39:47.142
I told them.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.764
Now what?

39:50.346 --> 39:52.849
Now the White House.

40:02.523 --> 40:04.861
Base to 12-4.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.287
Go for 12-4.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.700
- Ron, we have a situation
down at the elementary school.

40:09.735 --> 40:11.082
How far out are you?

40:11.117 --> 40:13.915
- About two hours.
What kind of situation?

40:13.950 --> 40:16.714
- Some lunatic
has taken over the school.

40:16.749 --> 40:18.464
The elementary?

40:18.499 --> 40:21.127
- He's demanding a ransom.
That's all we know.

40:21.162 --> 40:22.468
Are my kids in there?

40:22.503 --> 40:24.050
Nadene, the FBI's on the line.

40:24.085 --> 40:26.220
- Nadene!
- Got to go.

40:26.255 --> 40:28.057
Oh.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.311
He better not touch my kids.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.670
- I hope we're not gonna have
any trouble.

41:03.705 --> 41:06.903
Your breath smells like Peaches.

41:06.938 --> 41:10.101
Well, I haven't been eating any.

41:10.136 --> 41:12.437
Peaches is my dog.

41:21.521 --> 41:25.276
- Hey, kids, kids,
we're going to play a game.

41:25.311 --> 41:26.991
Kids, hey.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.953
Come on, sweetie.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.761
- I'm gonna make a square,
a magic square.

41:32.796 --> 41:35.500
- What's a magic square?
- What's that?

41:35.535 --> 41:38.835
And no one is allowed
inside this magic square

41:38.870 --> 41:41.504
except Mr. Young...

41:46.791 --> 41:49.094
And Doris.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.014
Back up, guys.
Give me some room.

41:53.049 --> 41:54.979
Back up.
Give me some room.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.187
Can you give me some help?

42:07.650 --> 42:09.402
Okay.

42:16.159 --> 42:19.038
- Mr. Robbins,
what happens if somebody

42:19.073 --> 42:21.460
goes inside the magic square?

42:23.041 --> 42:24.918
<i>Then, uh...</i>

42:26.753 --> 42:29.506
They're out of the game.

42:35.261 --> 42:39.016
Okay, let's get a desk
for Mr. Young to sit on.

43:00.078 --> 43:02.476
Oh, yeah, everyone will know.

43:02.511 --> 43:04.875
Have you guys been on TV before?

43:04.910 --> 43:07.093
You will now.

43:07.877 --> 43:09.635
Hey, lady'?

43:09.670 --> 43:12.924
Is this your first time
kidnapping helpless, little children?

43:12.959 --> 43:15.518
Yeah, it's my first.

43:15.553 --> 43:17.471
But David...

43:17.506 --> 43:19.353
<i>Oh...</i>

43:19.388 --> 43:22.062
he has lots of great ideas.

43:23.101 --> 43:25.320
Even better ones than this?

43:29.565 --> 43:30.656
Yeah?

43:30.691 --> 43:32.944
But why are you doing this?

43:34.904 --> 43:37.552
- Well, my brother
is really sick in a hospital,

43:37.587 --> 43:40.201
so we're gonna send them money
so they'll keep

43:40.236 --> 43:42.374
taking care of him
so he can get better,

43:42.409 --> 43:43.997
so he can-

43:45.873 --> 43:48.467
Four "so"s.

44:00.930 --> 44:03.353
Do not try to enter the school.

44:03.388 --> 44:05.317
Stay back.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.567
The police will be here shortly.

44:08.602 --> 44:10.947
Stay back.

44:10.982 --> 44:14.361
It will only hurt your children
to push past barricades

44:14.396 --> 44:16.454
and go into the school.

44:18.573 --> 44:22.328
Teacher, are we going to die?

44:23.369 --> 44:26.543
- We can't die.
We're just little kids.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.218
I'll be right back, loves.

44:44.390 --> 44:45.937
Mr. Young?

44:55.359 --> 44:58.363
Mr. Young, I have
a proposition for you.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.165
You can keep me.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.999
You can shoot me
to make your point.

45:05.034 --> 45:07.170
I'm fine with that.

45:07.205 --> 45:10.084
But would you please
let the children go?

45:12.460 --> 45:16.465
I'll do whatever it takes
to keep them safe, Mr. Young.

45:22.094 --> 45:23.971
Mr. Young?

45:27.099 --> 45:30.228
- The best thing you can do
for these kids, lady,

45:30.263 --> 45:31.980
is sit down and shut up.

45:36.943 --> 45:39.116
How can a genius think around here?

45:44.617 --> 45:47.166
What do you want?

45:51.749 --> 45:53.626
Back off, little man!

45:55.044 --> 45:56.842
Come on, Jason.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.079
Oh, you're all sweaty.

46:07.114 --> 46:09.438
Help me get this off.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.725
The commissioner's here.

46:42.760 --> 46:45.059
- Nadene.
- Hey.

46:45.094 --> 46:47.188
- Now, I understand
this guy wants money.

46:48.931 --> 46:50.933
I'm ready to write him out a check.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.900
How much does he want?

46:57.106 --> 46:59.484
$200 million.

47:02.737 --> 47:04.739
Say again?

47:06.365 --> 47:10.086
$200 million.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.299
For those kids,

47:16.334 --> 47:20.305
I'll sell my entire ranch
if I have to, but...

47:21.922 --> 47:24.766
I don't have-
- I know.

47:24.801 --> 47:26.434
I know.

47:26.469 --> 47:28.517
The whole town couldn't.

47:37.104 --> 47:40.074
Hey, Billy, watch this.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.219
Magic foot in the magic square.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.387
Do you think this is funny'?

48:10.388 --> 48:13.141
Do you think this is a game?

48:15.476 --> 48:18.571
Go ahead and try it again.
We'll see who wins the game.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.776
Try it, big man!

48:23.901 --> 48:25.534
Try it

48:25.569 --> 48:28.197
- Hey, hey, he doesn't understand.
He's just a little kid.

48:28.232 --> 48:29.532
Shh, keep it down.

48:29.567 --> 48:30.790
- Hey.
- Shh.

48:30.825 --> 48:33.544
It's all right, sweetheart.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.174
<i>I...</i>

48:41.460 --> 48:44.088
I got to get out of here for a minute.

48:45.214 --> 48:46.466
Oh.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.183
I'm gonna put this on you.

48:49.218 --> 48:54.224
You can only move your hand
about this far.

48:54.259 --> 48:55.981
Okay.

48:56.016 --> 48:57.814
Don't even scratch your nose.

49:02.731 --> 49:05.280
When I come back,
this is all gonna end.

49:54.950 --> 49:59.330
Mrs. Young, do you have children?

50:02.583 --> 50:05.757
A child kind of opens up
your ability to care for others,

50:05.792 --> 50:07.096
don't you think?

50:08.339 --> 50:11.557
Oh, it sure did for me.

50:11.592 --> 50:15.847
- Would you want your child subjected
to this kind of terror?

50:19.183 --> 50:22.210
I can tell you're a good person.

50:22.245 --> 50:25.238
This wasn't your idea, was it?

50:27.691 --> 50:30.911
- Sometimes you just got to do
what it takes to keep the peace.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.748
This is keeping the peace?

50:40.579 --> 50:43.048
David is a visionary.

50:43.083 --> 50:45.132
He's brilliant.

50:45.167 --> 50:50.014
He figured out with a calculator
how to die and then come alive again.

50:50.049 --> 50:51.257
Amazing.

50:52.967 --> 50:54.468
What a mind.

50:54.503 --> 50:55.935
Okay, then...

50:55.970 --> 50:57.847
so don't get critical.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.522
Forgive me.

51:04.103 --> 51:06.276
I think it's the gasoline.

51:06.311 --> 51:07.947
I...

51:07.982 --> 51:10.130
I've got just such a headache.

51:10.165 --> 51:12.278
- Oh, me too. I...

51:25.114 --> 51:27.341
Children, go!

51:27.376 --> 51:30.380
Children, stay low.

51:30.415 --> 51:31.595
Get up!

51:51.400 --> 51:54.113
Stay away from the flames!

51:54.148 --> 51:56.826
Kids, kids, come to me!

51:56.861 --> 51:59.117
Children, go!

52:06.624 --> 52:09.047
Get down! Get down!

52:09.082 --> 52:11.045
Go! Go!

52:21.555 --> 52:24.104
- I can get you out.
Kids, come over here!

52:24.139 --> 52:26.022
Stay away from the flames!

52:31.148 --> 52:32.900
<i>' Go, go!</i>

52:44.244 --> 52:47.589
- Kids, get away from the building!
Run!

52:52.252 --> 52:54.675
- Hey, look, when I get there-
- It went off.

52:54.710 --> 52:56.891
The bomb went off!

52:59.635 --> 53:03.080
12-4 to base!

53:03.115 --> 53:06.482
12-4 to base!

53:06.517 --> 53:08.940
Nadene, you got to talk to me!

53:15.275 --> 53:17.869
How could You let this happen?

53:22.574 --> 53:24.872
'Cause You're not even there.

53:28.678 --> 53:30.322
Hurry, hurry, get out.

53:59.027 --> 54:01.495
Are there any children
left in the room?

54:01.530 --> 54:04.955
If there are any kids in the room,
come to me.

54:04.990 --> 54:06.952
Kids, follow my voice.

54:06.987 --> 54:08.293
Oh, come on.

54:08.328 --> 54:10.080
Gather on the far lawn!

54:10.115 --> 54:13.004
On the south lawn!

54:48.786 --> 54:51.539
<i>Jase, you doing okay?</i>

54:52.748 --> 54:56.844
Honey, do you want
anything to eat at all?

55:00.005 --> 55:02.765
Cindy's doing okay,

55:02.800 --> 55:05.476
but he isn't coming out of it.

55:05.511 --> 55:09.766
He just keeps watching
that cop show over and over.

55:11.308 --> 55:15.188
- Give him some time.
- Ron, he needs help.

55:21.819 --> 55:24.197
I'll see what I can set up.

55:25.239 --> 55:27.333
It's my fault.

55:29.409 --> 55:33.255
No child should be subjected
to that kind of terror.

55:34.414 --> 55:36.041
I should've been there to protect them.

55:37.866 --> 55:39.551
Where was I?

55:39.586 --> 55:41.088
Try it, big man!

55:46.051 --> 55:48.811
Mr. Hartley?

55:48.846 --> 55:50.348
Are you all right?

55:53.725 --> 55:56.103
He's been in there a long time.

55:56.138 --> 55:58.526
Almost two hours.

56:01.316 --> 56:03.569
Should I be worried?

56:08.967 --> 56:12.127
Mr. Hartley?

56:14.121 --> 56:16.129
How's he doing?

56:16.164 --> 56:18.465
Well, that's a good question.

56:18.500 --> 56:22.300
I think you and Jason need to sit down
and have a nice, long talk.

56:34.433 --> 56:37.061
- Yeah, you're right.
He's a good doctor.

56:39.104 --> 56:40.445
Why don't you go play for a minute?

56:40.480 --> 56:42.778
I'll grab your mom,
and then we'll talk, okay?

56:42.813 --> 56:44.947
Okay.

56:51.909 --> 56:54.182
- Hey.
How did it go?

56:54.217 --> 56:56.456
Oh, it went great.

56:58.332 --> 57:02.508
I guess there's a few things
he hasn't been telling us,

57:02.543 --> 57:04.845
so I think it's time we have a talk.

57:04.880 --> 57:09.226
- Ron, don't interrogate him
like he's a suspect.

57:13.931 --> 57:17.686
Jase, the doctor
said that we should talk.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.693
Do you know why he said that?

57:25.359 --> 57:27.703
Don't you want to talk to us?

57:29.363 --> 57:31.010
It's just-

57:31.045 --> 57:32.623
I'm scared.

57:32.658 --> 57:34.912
Don't be scared, honey.

57:34.947 --> 57:37.167
You can tell us anything.

57:40.624 --> 57:44.003
- It's about that day
with the mean guy.

57:45.796 --> 57:47.137
Okay.

57:47.172 --> 57:50.515
Well, the thing is,
what I didn't tell you

57:50.550 --> 57:54.475
was that there were other people
in the room with us.

57:54.510 --> 57:56.314
You mean the teachers?

58:00.268 --> 58:02.896
What other people?

58:05.065 --> 58:07.818
The ones all in white.

58:10.529 --> 58:12.910
One was a lady.

58:12.945 --> 58:15.248
She stood by me.

58:15.283 --> 58:18.207
She said that what those people
were doing was very bad

58:18.242 --> 58:20.879
and that the bomb was gonna go off.

58:20.914 --> 58:24.669
She said if I stood by the window,
everything would be okay.

58:26.294 --> 58:28.547
So she helped you?

58:30.882 --> 58:33.055
Did she tell you her name?

58:35.303 --> 58:37.806
- But I think it
was Grandma Meister.

58:39.516 --> 58:42.611
- Jase, Grandma Meister
lives in Pinedale.

58:42.646 --> 58:44.730
She wasn't at your school that day.

58:46.982 --> 58:49.076
Okay.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.720
That's Grandma Meister.

59:31.735 --> 59:33.535
That's her.

59:33.570 --> 59:36.449
That's the lady you saw?

59:36.484 --> 59:38.746
That's my angel.

59:46.333 --> 59:49.303
- I think that's just too much
of a coincidence

59:49.338 --> 59:51.672
to be a coincidence.

59:54.883 --> 59:58.854
- Jase, why didn't you
tell us about this before?

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:03.434
- 'Cause I knew
you wouldn't believe me.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.953
What do you think?

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:31.545
You don't want to know what I think.

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.388
Say it.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.896
I'm just not buying his angel story.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:45.772
I think it's his coping mechanism.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:50.359
- You don't believe our own son?
Y

01:00:50.394 --> 01:00:53.534
- You know how I think.
I need proof.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:58.743
- So you treat your son
like a criminal?

01:00:58.778 --> 01:01:01.160
That's how it works.

01:01:01.195 --> 01:01:03.543
I'm trained that way.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:07.627
Well, then go find your proof.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:12.711
Maybe Jason wasn't the only one.

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:17.383
You're the sheriff's investigator.

01:01:17.418 --> 01:01:20.056
Look into it.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:23.643
Okay.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:28.565
I'll pay some visits around town,
see what I can come up with.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.363
Anything at all?

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:35.949
Anything out of the ordinary?

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:37.742
- Well, the first thing
I'd tell you is the fact

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:41.116
that the fire alarms went off
for no reason a couple of times

01:01:41.151 --> 01:01:44.455
in the days just before the bombing.

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:47.140
Those alarms prepared
the kids in a big way.

01:01:47.175 --> 01:01:49.754
They learned to get
out of a room quickly,

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:52.713
to stay low, to crawl
if they needed to find air,

01:01:52.748 --> 01:01:55.637
but nobody knows
why the alarms were going off

01:01:55.672 --> 01:01:59.181
or why now they've just stopped.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:03.016
And then I'd look at that business
about the magic square.

01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:06.396
If Ben hadn't been prompted
to put that down,

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:09.810
there would've been kids right up
next to the bomb when it went off.

01:02:09.845 --> 01:02:12.483
They'd have ended up just like Doris.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:17.868
- But don't you think
that's just coincidences?

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:20.785
Maybe.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.369
But I don't think so.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:32.841
- Then I saw Rich Haskell.
He's the bomb expert.

01:02:32.876 --> 01:02:34.549
Hartley, when that bomb went off,

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.801
there shouldn't have been
any survivors,

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:40.552
but then there wasn't near as big
an explosion as there should've been.

01:02:40.587 --> 01:02:44.269
One big factor was that the meat-head
just happened to choose a milk jug

01:02:44.304 --> 01:02:46.684
as the container to put the gas in...

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:48.808
a container that leaked.

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:53.486
Now, the fumes that it gave off
got them to open the windows.

01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:55.230
Can we at least open the windows?

01:02:55.265 --> 01:02:57.948
<i>Do it.</i>

01:02:57.983 --> 01:03:00.719
He let them keep the doors open.

01:03:00.754 --> 01:03:03.411
'Cause the bathrooms right there.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:06.245
- Those openings created
a vent for the blast.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.668
Also, the leaking gas
ran down into a can

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:12.877
that he had filled
with aluminum particles and flour.

01:03:12.912 --> 01:03:15.091
They were designed
to shoot into the air on fire,

01:03:15.126 --> 01:03:17.467
creating an even bigger explosion.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:20.130
It would've been
like the air was on fire.

01:03:20.165 --> 01:03:21.680
Now.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:24.514
- But with it wet,
it couldn't happen.

01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:26.935
See, those things I understand,

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.440
but there were just too many things
that I cannot explain,

01:03:30.475 --> 01:03:33.692
like only two of the five
blasting caps went off.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:37.106
The wires that were set to trigger
the other blasting caps were cut.

01:03:37.141 --> 01:03:40.024
They weren't pulled out,
they weren't ripped,

01:03:40.059 --> 01:03:42.907
but cleanly cut,
like snipped with wire cutters.

01:03:42.942 --> 01:03:46.122
If those wires
had been connected,

01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:48.707
it would've kill-

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:51.916
it would've killed everyone
in the room.

01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:54.212
And then...

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:57.342
The cartridges that
he had rigged inside the bomb

01:03:57.377 --> 01:03:59.336
started exploding.

01:03:59.371 --> 01:04:01.261
Now, you tell me.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:07.019
How did the walls get all pocked up
and damaged

01:04:07.054 --> 01:04:09.263
Without shrapnel
going through people?

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.522
It doesn't make sense.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:18.608
It doesn't make sense.

01:04:18.643 --> 01:04:21.398
He wasn't that stupid.

01:04:21.433 --> 01:04:24.117
He wasn't that stupid.

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:27.076
I don't think he would have picked
a milk jug that leaked.

01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:31.999
I think whoever
or whatever cut those wires

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.371
made the milk jug leak.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.958
Well, we can think a lot of things,

01:04:37.993 --> 01:04:41.551
but here's a fact.

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:43.964
In his journal, the guy bragged
about how many times

01:04:43.999 --> 01:04:45.764
he assembled the bomb, tested it,

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:49.849
and every time it worked
exactly the way he planned,

01:04:49.884 --> 01:04:52.479
except this time.

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:54.858
What do you make of that?

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:01.363
Unexplainable things
happen all the time.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:04.277
I don't know. Maybe the guy
just messed up this time.

01:05:04.312 --> 01:05:06.744
And cut his own wires?

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.681
Well, that's just the bomb side of it.

01:05:13.716 --> 01:05:16.622
Then there's the other side of it...

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:19.840
The walkers.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:25.426
- Katie, can you tell
Mr. Hartley what you told me?

01:05:25.461 --> 01:05:28.096
Katie, he wants to hear from you.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.980
Well, I was coloring,

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:40.270
and then when I looked up,
there was this lady standing there.

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:47.201
She was all in white.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.621
She told me that she loved me

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:54.580
and that my brother
would come and get me

01:05:54.615 --> 01:05:57.127
and everything would be okay.

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.755
And then I looked down for a second...

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:06.719
And when I looked back up,
she was gone.

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:10.349
Then my brother came
and took me over by the window.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:18.392
- when the bomb went off,
she was right there to get out.

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:23.485
- And her sister claims
that she saw something too.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.615
- I was coloring,
and when I looked up,

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:32.281
I saw angels all around where
the tape on the floor was.

01:06:32.316 --> 01:06:34.038
The angel people,

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:37.871
they stayed between us and the bad guy.

01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:41.669
One was a lady, and she stood by me.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:46.090
Rachel, what did the lady look like?

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:48.508
It was like a white dress.

01:06:48.543 --> 01:06:50.889
What kind of hair?

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:54.929
Like yours but more curly.

01:06:54.964 --> 01:06:57.272
But my same color?

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.776
Excuse me a minute.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.706
Look at this.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.879
That's her.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:24.672
That's my angel.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:27.051
Except without the glasses.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.675
That's my mother, Mr. Hartley.

01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:34.676
She died when I was 15.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:40.607
Oh, she must've come back
to watch over them.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.729
And there were others.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.357
The Sorensen girl said a woman
helped her out of the room.

01:07:49.392 --> 01:07:51.576
- We got to get out of here!
- Come on!

01:07:51.611 --> 01:07:53.320
Go, kids, go!

01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:02.838
- Then when I got out the door,
the lady was gone.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:11.801
- Jennie later identified
the woman as her aunt

01:08:11.836 --> 01:08:13.969
who died ten years ago.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.054
So again it was an ancestor?

01:08:20.774 --> 01:08:22.354
Yeah.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.813
What's that about?

01:08:24.848 --> 01:08:26.776
Who else?

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:30.566
Who else would care more
about us than our own family?

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.322
Can't you see?

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:39.036
You can't see
what's going on here?

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:42.581
I don't know what I see.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.167
You are such a cop.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:56.429
Every adult and every child
made it out of that explosion alive,

01:08:56.464 --> 01:09:00.804
and you haven't the humility
to thank God for blessing us.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.613
Hey, bud.

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:19.283
Come here a minute.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:30.048
You Okay?

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.926
Did we wake you?

01:09:32.962 --> 01:09:34.636
Good.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.514
There's something else
I want to talk to you about.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:41.432
Jase, was there anything else

01:09:41.466 --> 01:09:45.189
that maybe you didn't tell us?

01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:46.939
Anything at all?

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:50.524
It would really help your dad
if you could think of something.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:56.071
Yeah, I know something else.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.245
Light-bulbs.

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.288
Right before the bomb went off,

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:05.372
lots of angels came down
through the ceiling.

01:10:05.407 --> 01:10:07.962
They looked like light-bulbs.

01:10:07.997 --> 01:10:09.877
Light-bulbs.

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:18.132
You mean like this?

01:10:18.167 --> 01:10:20.600
Uh-uh.

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:25.354
Like that.

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:40.702
There was an angel
for everybody.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:43.246
They were holding hands
in a circle around the bomb.

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:47.912
Then when the bomb happened,
they went fast up into the ceiling.

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:52.422
This guy had police training.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:54.980
He knew what he was doing
with that bomb,

01:10:55.015 --> 01:10:57.468
but it didn't work
like it was designed.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:11:00.177
It should've gone out,
but instead it went straight up

01:11:00.212 --> 01:11:01.641
through the ceiling.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:21.786
- Why don't you go on upstairs,
okay, honey?

01:11:21.821 --> 01:11:22.904
I'll be there in a minute.

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:29.749
There is no way
Jason could've known that.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:36.794
- There's something else that I learned
that happened that day.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.577
Do you think this is funny?

01:11:48.612 --> 01:11:50.897
Do you think this is a game?

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:54.687
Go ahead and try it again.
We'll see who wins this game.

01:11:54.722 --> 01:11:56.876
You want to talk miracles?

01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:59.031
I'll tell you a miracle.

01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:01.151
Try it, big man!

01:12:01.186 --> 01:12:02.658
Try in

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.786
That me and every other officer

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:07.826
just happened to be
out of town that day,

01:12:07.861 --> 01:12:10.792
because I know
that if I would've been there,

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:14.377
I would've stormed into that room
with so much hatred for that man...

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:20.719
I probably would've gotten myself
and everyone else killed.

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:26.057
But without me
and the other cops,

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.893
there was a chance
for it to go another way.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:32.023
- Hey, he doesn't understand.
He's just a little kid.

01:12:32.058 --> 01:12:34.062
<i>Hey -</i>

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:40.356
- Let's say a prayer.
Pass it on.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.741
- Let's say a prayer.
Pass it on.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:47.997
- Let's say a prayer.
- Let's say a prayer.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.120
Allyson, you say it.

01:12:54.155 --> 01:12:56.295
Why me?

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.334
- Because you're
the smartest in the class.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:05.012
Dear God,

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:08.893
We need Your help today,
especially if the bomb goes off.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:16.651
- Most every child prayed
sometime during the crisis...

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:21.439
<i>Not because
somebody told them to...</i>

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.067
But because they wanted to.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:28.988
And they weren't the only ones.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:03.819
Please, God, please.

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:07.945
- They won't allow us to be
on the elementary school grounds,

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.760
but we can do something right here.

01:14:10.795 --> 01:14:13.541
I may get fired for doing this,

01:14:13.576 --> 01:14:16.832
but if anyone wants to,

01:14:16.867 --> 01:14:20.089
please join me in prayer.

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:27.968
The entire high school got together

01:14:28.003 --> 01:14:30.513
and knelt in prayer.

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:36.143
Praying for their
little brothers and sisters,

01:14:36.178 --> 01:14:39.062
their moms and their dads.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.781
Prayers for their safety were going on,

01:14:53.816 --> 01:14:56.830
not just throughout the town...

01:14:56.865 --> 01:14:59.545
12-4 to base!

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:03.756
Nadene, you got to talk to me!

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:07.760
But as the news spread,
throughout the whole country.

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:10.719
- The man and his wife have herded
the entire student body

01:15:10.754 --> 01:15:11.973
into one classroom.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:13.391
They are demanding a ransom,

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:18.148
and we understand that that ransom
is $2 million for each child held.

01:15:18.183 --> 01:15:20.813
The nearest hospital
is in Montpelier, Idaho,

01:15:20.848 --> 01:15:22.775
which is about 30 miles away.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:24.652
That hospital and others are gearing up

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:29.568
for what could be a disaster
of epic proportions.

01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:34.620
Maybe even the world.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:44.794
Dear God...

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:57.475
- Even then you couldn't bring
yourself to pray?

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:07.067
It'd never worked before.

01:16:07.102 --> 01:16:08.861
Why should it then?

01:16:17.364 --> 01:16:20.618
- Hey.
It's all right, sweetheart.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.726
We pray that we will all be safe

01:16:24.761 --> 01:16:27.402
and that everyone will live.

01:16:27.437 --> 01:16:30.044
We pray in Jesus's name.
Amen.

01:16:30.079 --> 01:16:32.263
Amen.

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:37.260
I got to get out of here for a minute.

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:41.479
But if you ask me,

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:43.812
the most amazing thing...

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:53.196
Is that even though these kids
and these teachers

01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:57.497
were terrorized for two hours
by a raving lunatic...

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:02.752
<i>So many of them turned
and went back into that room to...</i>

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.713
make sure that everybody was out.

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:10.547
They went into a room
that was on fire

01:17:10.582 --> 01:17:12.545
that they could barely breathe in,

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.512
with a madman and his guns

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:18.302
and cartridges
exploding everywhere,

01:17:18.337 --> 01:17:19.722
trying to help others.

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.108
- You're gonna be okay.
Come on.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:43.250
Is there anyone still in here?

01:17:43.285 --> 01:17:44.333
Me.

01:17:45.821 --> 01:17:47.205
Cindy.
Oh.

01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:52.592
Out the window.
Go, go.

01:17:52.627 --> 01:17:54.802
Ben?

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:58.011
- And one of them that was saved
at the end was our Cindy.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:00.885
- I got her.
I got her.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.595
- Take her!
- I got her.

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:05.815
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.779
Oh, my babies.

01:18:15.814 --> 01:18:17.952
Oh, my goodness.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:22.119
Where's Daddy?

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:32.087
Ron, it's all right in front of you.

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:37.968
I see it.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.972
But I don't-

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.378
Hop out, bud.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:27.229
I'm staying with Dad.

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:41.861
- Well, I'm not staying.
I'm going in.

01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:52.455
- We'll meet you right here
after class, okay?

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:55.879
- Be good.
- Bye, bud.

01:19:55.914 --> 01:19:58.172
Hi. Hey.

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:06.093
Hi.

01:20:06.128 --> 01:20:08.430
What?

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.690
I shouldn't be here.

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:17.481
I thought I could do this for Jase,
but I can't.

01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:20.698
I've got so much hatred
for those people,

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:24.328
and I know they're dead,
and I'm glad they're dead.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:29.496
Ron, I love you.

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:34.295
You're the greatest man I know,

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:37.709
but I will not raise our children
seeing you like this.

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:42.755
You had better figure out
what's real in this world

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:45.472
and what's not,

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.475
or you could lose us.

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:04.493
- Hey, come on, you guys.
Let's go to class.

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:15.171
- It's only natural that our faith
is tested when bad things happen,

01:21:15.206 --> 01:21:19.508
to ask ourselves, if God is in control,

01:21:19.543 --> 01:21:21.550
then why didn't He stop this?

01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:25.277
Why did He let those people
enter the school?

01:21:25.312 --> 01:21:29.477
Why did He let any
of our innocent ones get hurt?

01:21:29.512 --> 01:21:33.643
And not just the children
and those in room 4.

01:21:33.678 --> 01:21:36.357
We've all been wounded

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:39.729
because those
we love the most have been hurt.

01:21:39.764 --> 01:21:43.030
And because we're human,
it's only natural

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:46.160
that we have feelings of hatred
towards those that did this,

01:21:46.195 --> 01:21:51.097
but hatred toward them
is a dead-end journey.

01:21:51.132 --> 01:21:56.000
Hatred towards them
is like drinking a poison

01:21:56.035 --> 01:21:57.996
and hoping it will kill your enemies.

01:21:58.031 --> 01:21:59.964
It doesn't work.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:05.634
What will work, what will save us
from a lifetime of hatred and loathing

01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:10.180
is the same thing that saved
our children in that room...

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:14.188
Prayer.

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:18.476
We've all witnessed the miracle
of how prayer can save lives.

01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:22.403
Now let's let it heal our hearts.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:47.634
<i># Pray He is there #</i>

01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:49.638
<i># Speak #</i>

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:53.475
<i># He is listening #</i>

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:58.061
<i># You are His child #</i>

01:22:58.096 --> 01:23:00.774
<i># His love #</i>

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:05.112
<i># Now surrounds you #</i>

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:10.405
<i># He hears your prayers #</i>

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:15.762
<i># He loves the children #</i>

01:23:15.797 --> 01:23:21.487
<i># Of such is the kingdom #</i>

01:23:21.522 --> 01:23:25.267
<i># The kingdom of Heaven #</i>

01:23:25.302 --> 01:23:28.969
<i># Heavenly Father #</i>

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:32.389
<i># Are You really there? #</i>

01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:38.352
<i># And do You hear and answer
every child's prayer? #</i>

01:23:38.387 --> 01:23:43.692
<i># Some say that Heaven is far away u#</i>

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:49.676
<i># But I feel it close around me
as I pray #</i>

01:23:50.111 --> 01:23:54.538
<i># Heavenly Father, I remember now #</i>

01:23:54.573 --> 01:23:58.665
Dear God, please forgive me.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.419
<i># Something that Jesus
told his disciples long ago #</i>

01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:06.715
<i># Suffer the children to come 10 me #</i>

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:11.347
<i># Father, in prayer
I'm coming now to Thee #</i>

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.810
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:22.899
Can you forgive me?

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:26.691
Let's go find your mom, okay?

01:24:26.726 --> 01:24:27.688
Come on.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:34.491
<i># Father, in prayer
I'm coming now to Thee #</i>

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:25.776
- We knew that a miracle
had happened,

01:31:25.811 --> 01:31:29.242
and there was a spirit
about the town.

01:31:29.277 --> 01:31:30.909
We loved each other.

01:31:30.944 --> 01:31:34.681
It was a gift, and we knew it.

01:31:34.716 --> 01:31:37.922
We know that there are people

01:31:37.957 --> 01:31:40.665
on the other side who care.

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:43.374
We know we're not alone.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:47.300
We know.

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:50.011
I know I'm here for a reason,

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:52.265
and it's my children and my husband.

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:54.950
And I was saved that day

01:31:54.985 --> 01:31:57.600
to be a mother to them

01:31:57.635 --> 01:31:59.980
and to teach them

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:03.895
that not everyone
in this world is good,

01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:06.456
but that we can forgive

01:32:06.491 --> 01:32:08.947
and that we can move on.

01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:11.366
Doris Young told us that...

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:15.247
- Kids, this is an experience
you'll all tell your children

01:32:15.282 --> 01:32:18.037
and your grandchildren all about.

01:32:18.072 --> 01:32:19.708
And she was right.

01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:22.166
I will tell my children
and my grandchildren

01:32:22.201 --> 01:32:24.587
over and over

01:32:24.622 --> 01:32:28.005
of the miracles of that day

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:31.344
and that prayers are answered.

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:35.345
I know that He protected us that day.

01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:39.269
He sent His angels to protect us,

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:43.025
and I'm not ashamed
to be a voice of that.

01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:45.749
Before I go to bed at night,

01:32:45.784 --> 01:32:48.439
I check on my four children.

01:32:52.067 --> 01:32:54.115
They are miracles to me.

01:32:57.072 --> 01:33:01.623
They wouldn't be here if I wasn't here.
