IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.675 --> 00:11.145
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.714
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.747 --> 00:15.483
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.516 --> 00:16.784
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:16.817 --> 00:18.819
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.488
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.158
>> CASEY KNOWS HER STUFF,
MR. OSWALD.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.426
DOUBLE-COATED ANNEALING,

00:25.459 --> 00:27.195
PRECIOUS METAL
ON HEAVY-BASED GLASS,

00:27.228 --> 00:29.397
REALLY DIVINE
COLORS AND TEXTURES...

00:29.430 --> 00:30.831
>> I LIKE TEXTURE.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.102
>> [giggling] SHE DOESN'T LIKE
TO MASS PRODUCE.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.403
EVERY PIECE IS UNIQUE.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.770
>> COME ON, EVIE.

00:36.804 --> 00:40.174
>> CASEY, I'VE BROUGHT SOMEONE
BY TO SEE YOUR CERAMICS.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.643
OH, GOD!

00:52.620 --> 00:59.393
[camera flashing]

00:59.427 --> 01:01.829
>> LEICA'S DONE.
YOU CAN COME IN NOW.

01:01.862 --> 01:05.433
CASEY CHAPMAN, 28,
UP-AND-COMING CERAMICS ARTIST.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.469
NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY.
ONE WINDOW FOUND OPEN.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.138
>> MUST'VE CONNED HIS WAY IN.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.472
>> [sighs]

01:11.505 --> 01:13.841
SHE'S GOT PETECHIAE.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.244
TORTURED, HOG-TIED,
POSED FOR SHOCK VALUE,

01:16.277 --> 01:17.878
JUST LIKE APRIL SILVA
THREE WEEKS AGO.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.114
>> SAME GLUED LIP LOCK, TOO.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.482
>> LET'S JUST
HOPE THIS CRIME SCENE

01:21.515 --> 01:22.650
IS NOT AS CLEAN AS THAT ONE.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.118
>> HE'S LEARNING.

01:24.152 --> 01:27.221
HE TOOK HIS RESTRAINTS
WITH HIM THIS TIME.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.856
CHECK THESE BLISTERS OUT.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.458
THAT LOOK LIKE AN ACID BURN?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.293
>> MORE LIKE A SCALD
FROM BOILING WATER.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.128
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

01:34.162 --> 01:36.497
I GOT FIVE KIDS, SOMETIMES THEY
GRAB A POT FROM A HOT STOVE.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.466
BANDAGED MY FAIR SHARE
OF WOUNDS.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.269
>> WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE SADIST IS ESCALATING.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.371
AND HE NEEDS MORE PAIN
TO GET OFF.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.638
>> OR DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.739
HOT WATER, BLEACH.

01:45.773 --> 01:46.907
THAT'LL DEGRADE
FLUIDS AND FIBERS.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.142
>> I DON'T KNOW.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.511
I THINK HE'S JUST WINDING UP.

01:50.544 --> 01:54.715
>> WELL, THEN WE SHUT HIM DOWN
BEFORE HE GOES THREE FOR THREE.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.853
[dramatic music]

01:59.887 --> 02:06.160
*

02:44.298 --> 02:46.600
>> THERE'S NO FOREIGN
HAIRS OR FIBERS ON THE BODY.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.269
>> SO WE'RE NOWHERE.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.303
>> LIGHTS.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.406
CSU VACUUMED
THREE FOREIGN PUBIC HAIRS

02:52.440 --> 02:53.474
FROM THE CARPET.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.776
THEY'RE RUNNING DNA NOW.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.278
>> TIME OF DEATH?

02:57.311 --> 02:59.813
>> APPROXIMATELY 34 HOURS
PRIOR TO DISCOVERY.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.783
CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ASPHYXIA
FROM STRANGULATION.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.952
PRE-MORTEM INJURIES
INCLUDE FRACTURES

03:04.985 --> 03:07.421
OF THE LEFT ZYGOMATIC ARCH
AND THE MAXILLA.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.389
>> SAME AS APRIL SILVA,

03:08.422 --> 03:09.957
PUNCHED IN THE FACE
DURING A BLITZ ATTACK.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.559
>> ANY OTHER SIMILARITIES?

03:11.592 --> 03:12.960
>> THEY BOTH HAD
THEIR MOUTHS GLUED SHUT.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.695
AND BOTH HYOIDS WERE BROKEN.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.297
BUT WITHOUT THE RESTRAINTS,

03:16.330 --> 03:19.233
I CAN'T CONCLUDE THAT
CASEY CHAPMAN WAS HOG-TIED.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.635
>> WHAT ABOUT THE LIGATURE MARKS
ON THE WRIST, ANKLES, AND NECK?

03:21.669 --> 03:24.838
>> LIVIDITY PROVES
SHE WAS BOUND, NOT HOW.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.907
THIS NEW VICTIM
WASN'T SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.477
AND HE USED MORE GLUE
TO SEAL HER RECTUM.

03:29.510 --> 03:33.581
IT TOOK AN ACETONE LEVAGE
JUST TO GET THE SCOPE IN.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.982
>> YOU'RE SURE
SHE WASN'T RAPED FIRST?

03:35.015 --> 03:37.985
>> THERE WAS NO FLUIDS,
NO LUBRICANTS...

03:38.018 --> 03:40.421
NO TEARING, NO VAGINAL SWELLING.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.722
>> COULD BE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.357
A LOT OF SERIAL RAPISTS
CAN'T PERFORM.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.493
>> WHICH JUST FEEDS THEIR RAGE.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.694
>> THEN FIND HIM FAST.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.961
IF HE'S GOING THIS FAR,
WHAT'S NEXT?

03:49.062 --> 03:52.566
>> TWO VICTIMS, SAME TYPE
OF INJURIES, SAME M.O.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.036
NO FORCED ENTRY, NO DNA,
NO FLUIDS, NO FIBERS.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.906
ONE BIG DIFFERENCE--
HE RAPED APRIL, NOT CASEY.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.374
>> COULD BE TWO DIFFERENT GUYS.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.742
>> YOU THINKING COPYCAT?

04:01.775 --> 04:02.743
>> WELL,
DETAILS WEREN'T RELEASED.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.877
MORE LIKE TWO GUYS HUNTING.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.046
>> THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
TO SUGGEST

04:06.079 --> 04:07.681
THAT THERE ARE
TWO DIFFERENT PERPS HERE.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.916
>> THERE'S NO EVIDENCE, PERIOD.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.017
>> WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE VICTIM?

04:10.050 --> 04:12.986
>> CASEY CHAPMAN, SHE'S
A 28-YEAR-OLD WHITE FEMALE,

04:13.020 --> 04:16.290
SHE LIVES IN AN ARTIST'S LOFT
NEAR STRIVER'S ROW.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.459
>> APRIL SILVA,
25-YEAR-OLD LATINA,

04:18.492 --> 04:21.495
SHE WAS A POST-GRADUATE MATH
STUDENT AT HUDSON.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.631
SHE LIVED IN A CLOSET IN
SPANISH HARLEM.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.333
HER WALLS WERE PAPER-THIN

04:25.366 --> 04:27.301
AND THE NEIGHBORS HEARD NADA.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.969
>> YEAH,
BECAUSE THE BASTARD GLUED

04:29.002 --> 04:30.604
HER MOUTH SHUT
TO KEEP HER QUIET.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.806
>> THE ONLY SIMILARITY
SO FAR IS...

04:32.840 --> 04:33.807
THEY LIVED IN HARLEM.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.309
HIS HUNTING GROUND.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.510
>> DON'T FORGET BUSHWICK,

04:36.544 --> 04:38.379
QUEENS, AND EAST NEW YORK,
GENTLEMEN.

04:39.547 --> 04:42.350
I'M DETECTIVE VICTOR MORAN,
MAJOR CRIMES.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.785
HERE'S A FLASH DRIVE WITH
SOME OTHER CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.620
>> ARE YOU SAYING OUR PERP
HAS HIT BEFORE?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.389
>> WITH YOUR TWO,
THAT'S FIVE DEAD.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.557
>> THIS GUY'S ALL OVER THE MAP,

04:49.590 --> 04:50.891
HOW COULD YOU BE SO SURE?

04:50.924 --> 04:53.961
>> THE SIGNATURE WAS THE SAME
ON EACH VICTIM.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.396
WE FOUND THEM HOG-TIED,

04:55.429 --> 04:57.365
AND ALL THREE MOUTHS
WERE GLUED SHUT.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.635
BUSHWICK AND EAST NEW YORK
VICTIMS WERE BOTH RAPED.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.104
HE ADDED SODOMY
WITH APRIL SILVA.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.408
AS WITH CASEY CHAPMAN, QUEENS
WAS NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTED,

05:07.441 --> 05:08.876
BUT THEY FOUND GLUE IN HER ASS.

05:08.909 --> 05:09.743
I'M THINKING IT'S ONE GUY

05:09.777 --> 05:11.345
GETTING SMARTER
WITH EVERY CRIME SCENE.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.513
>> YEAH, ME TOO.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.615
THE PERP'S NEED TO DEBASE
AND HUMILIATE IS CONSISTENT,

05:14.648 --> 05:15.716
WHETHER HE RAPES THEM OR NOT.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.084
>> WELL,
IF THIS IS THE SAME HUMP,

05:17.117 --> 05:19.753
WHY ARE WE JUST HEARING
ABOUT YOUR CASES NOW?

05:19.787 --> 05:21.622
>> IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO PUT IT TOGETHER.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.125
THE FIRST VICTIM WAS
BOUND WITH HER OWN BELTS.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.927
THE SECOND HERE WITH SCARVES.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.096
THE THIRD WITH ROPE
HE BROUGHT WITH HIM.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.865
>> FUNNY THING, WHEN I
RAN THE M.O. THROUGH VICAP,

05:31.899 --> 05:33.133
NONE OF YOUR THREE CASES
CAME UP.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.403
>> I BLOCKED YOUR ACCESS.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.970
>> A GLORY HOG.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.472
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.940
IT'S ABOUT THEM.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.542
>> REALLY? THEN WHY CLOG
THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.477
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING
THIS CASE FOR SIX MONTHS,

05:43.511 --> 05:44.978
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE IN MY WAY.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.747
NOW, HE WAS ATTACKING
EVERY 55 DAYS,

05:46.780 --> 05:48.449
NOW IT'S DOWN TO 19.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.383
SOON, IT'LL BE TEN.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.452
THEN SEVEN.
UNTIL HE'S DOING TWO A DAY.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.786
>> WELL, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.455
WE'VE GOT HIM NOW THAT
WE'VE GOT ALL THE FACTS.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.723
>> HE'S MINE, DETECTIVE.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.591
I KNOW HIM.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.992
>> WE HAVE THE LAST TWO VICTIMS.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.027
>> NOT FOR LONG,

06:00.060 --> 06:02.496
CHIEF OF D'S IS IN
WITH YOUR CAPTAIN RIGHT NOW.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.833
>> MY SQUAD CAN CLOSE THIS.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.568
>> YOU THINK YOUR SQUAD
CAN CLOSE IT.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.603
I KNOW MORAN WILL.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.572
>> YOU JUST GOT PROMOTED,
AND YOUR FIRST ORDER

06:11.605 --> 06:14.074
AS CHIEF OF DETECTIVES
IS TO BEND ME OVER MY DESK?

06:14.107 --> 06:15.609
>> THIS IS NO REFLECTION

06:15.643 --> 06:18.479
ON YOUR SQUAD'S
INVESTIGATIVE SKILLS, CAPTAIN.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.014
MORAN I.D.'D THE PATTERN
ON THIS GUY.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.916
HE WORKED THESE HOMICIDES.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.518
IT'S THE ONLY ONE ON HIS PLATE.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.887
>> WE'VE BEEN WORKING
THESE CASES AROUND THE CLOCK.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.856
>> AND YOU STILL
DON'T KNOW ENOUGH.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.693
TWO OF THE VICTIMS
HAVE A DOCTOR IN COMMON.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.962
THREE GO TO
THE SAME GROCERY STORE,

06:34.995 --> 06:36.464
HALF TOOK A RECENT TRIP.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.631
>> AND HOW CAN WE KNOW THAT

06:37.665 --> 06:38.899
WITH YOU KEEPING
EVERYBODY IN THE DARK?

06:38.932 --> 06:40.468
>> IT WOULDN'T MATTER.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.502
YOU'D STILL BE PLAYING CATCH-UP.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.470
I'M STILL ON THE MAN'S TRAIL.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.638
>> YOU GOT A SUSPECT PROFILE?

06:44.672 --> 06:46.774
>> BLACK, LATINO MALE.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.476
LATE 20'S TO EARLY 30'S.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.544
>> A SERIAL KILLER'S
PREDATION USUALLY LASTS

06:50.578 --> 06:52.446
WITHIN THEIR OWN ETHNIC GROUP.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.047
THESE VICTIMS ARE MOSTLY WHITE.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.550
>> LOOK AT HIS PLAYGROUND.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.152
HE'S TARGETING MINORITY AREAS.

06:59.186 --> 07:02.690
HARLEM, THE BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS
OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS;

07:02.723 --> 07:04.124
THAT'S HIS COMFORT ZONE.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.660
>> PROFILING SEXUAL SADISTS
101, RIGHT?

07:06.694 --> 07:07.595
NEXT THING
HE'S GONNA DO IS TELL US

07:07.628 --> 07:10.130
HE PROBABLY DRIVES
A CLEAN, LATE MODEL CAR,

07:10.163 --> 07:12.866
HAS TROUBLE KEEPING A JOB
BECAUSE HE'S GOT A BAD TEMPER.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.536
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY COP
WHO'S SPENT TIME AT QUANTICO.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.204
>> BUT I'M THE ONLY COP
WORKING IT, SPORT.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.706
>> IT'S NOT OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.475
GIVE MORAN WHAT HE NEEDS,
AND STAY OUT OF HIS WAY.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.052
>> FEEL BETTER?

07:32.085 --> 07:34.855
>> NOT WITH YOU
USING THOSE VICTIMS

07:34.888 --> 07:36.590
TO GET A GOLD STAR
FROM THE BOSSES, NO.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.226
>> MY CAREER'S JUST FINE.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.729
>> 15 YEARS IN HOMICIDE,
FIVE IN MAJOR CRIMES.

07:43.831 --> 07:44.932
WHAT STALLED YOUR RISE?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.601
>> YOU ACCUSING ME OF SOMETHING?

07:47.635 --> 07:51.639
>> THE WORD IS YOU STOPPED BEING
A TEAM PLAYER ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.541
I WORK MUCH BETTER
BY MYSELF, TRUST ME.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.709
>> SO YOU'RE WILLING
TO RISK WOMEN'S LIVES

07:55.743 --> 07:58.011
ALL BECAUSE...

07:58.045 --> 07:59.179
YOU CAN'T SHARE.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.714
>> LOOK...

08:00.748 --> 08:03.283
NAILING THIS PRICK
IS MY ONLY PRIORITY.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.520
NOW, CAN YOU SAY THE SAME
WHEN THERE'S A SEXUAL ASSAULT

08:06.554 --> 08:08.221
EVERY FIVE MINUTES?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.624
YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO DEAL WITH.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.528
I'D LIKE SOME PRIVACY.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.304
>> WELL, I GOT A POTENTIAL
WITNESS ON THE CHAPMAN MURDER.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.973
>> WHO?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.074
>> HER NAME IS
DEBRA HUGGINS.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.609
SHE LIVES ONE FLOOR
BELOW CHAPMAN.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.910
SHE WORKS NIGHTS.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.880
AND SHE FOUND THE CARD WE LEFT
ON HER DOOR DURING THE CANVASS.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.314
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.650
>> KEEP HIM OCCUPIED.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.586
WE'RE NOT READY TO ROLL OVER
AND PLAY DEAD JUST YET.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.191
>> WHERE'S STABLER?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.826
>> HE NEEDED A BREAK.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.728
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THESE PETTY CONFLICTS.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.563
>> THAT'S WHY I FIGURED
I SHOULD TELL YOU

08:49.597 --> 08:50.831
WHAT ISN'T IN THOSE FILES.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.634
APRIL SILVA'S PARENTS
DIDN'T KNOW

08:53.667 --> 08:56.069
SHE HAD A GIRLFRIEND,
SHE WAS CATHOLIC.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.337
>> CASEY CHAPMAN?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.573
>> HER ART DEALER TOLD ME
SHE WAS INTO KINK.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.942
WE FOUND FUR CUFFS
AND OTHER TOYS IN HER CLOSET.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.578
>> NO MATCH FROM CODIS
ON THE PUBIC HAIRS

09:04.612 --> 09:05.713
FOUND AT
THE CHAPMAN CRIME SCENE.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.915
>> THIS GUY SHOULD BE
IN THE SYSTEM.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.684
THE WAY HE HUNTS,
HE'S BEEN AT THIS A WHILE.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.853
>> WE CAN WIDEN THIS SEARCH
WITH FAMILIAR DNA.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.155
>> SERIAL KILLERS
HAVE ABUSIVE PARENTS.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.624
SO IF THE HUMP'S
GOT ANY SIBLINGS,

09:16.657 --> 09:17.524
THEY PROBABLY HAVE RECORDS.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.827
>> I DON'T NEED CONVINCING,
DETECTIVE.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.894
JUST RUN IT.

09:20.928 --> 09:25.265
>> YES, SIR.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.300
>> I'M TRYING TO CATCH
A KILLER, NOT MAKE FRIENDS.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.269
>> BY YOURSELF.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.638
>> YOU THINK I'M OUT OF LINE?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.339
>> FROM THE MINUTE
YOU GOT HERE.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.245
>> IT'S AWFUL ABOUT CASEY.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.346
>> DID YOU KNOW HER WELL?

09:39.379 --> 09:41.882
>> NO, I ADMIRED ONE
OF HER BOWLS...

09:41.915 --> 09:44.618
SO SHE ASKED ME UP
TO HER STUDIO TO SEE HER WORK.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.186
>> YOU SAID YOU MAY
HAVE SEEN HER KILLER?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.355
>> THERE WAS A MAN
WAITING FOR THE ELEVATOR

09:48.388 --> 09:51.324
WHEN I CAME HOME,
AND HE SEEMED OFF SOMEHOW.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.126
>> WHAT MADE YOU SUSPICIOUS?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.394
>> HE WAS WEARING
A MAINTENANCE UNIFORM

09:54.427 --> 09:56.664
WITH NO COMPANY OR NAME PATCHES.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.798
BELLS WENT OFF.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.132
>> RACE?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.668
>> BLACK.
>> MM.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.202
WHAT'D HE LOOK LIKE?

10:02.235 --> 10:06.674
>> MID-TO-LATE 20s, 5'10",
CLOSE-CROPPED HAIR,

10:06.707 --> 10:10.811
LANKY BUILD, NO SCARS
OR TATTOOS THAT I COULD SEE.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.345
>> PRETTY GOOD MEMORY.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.014
>> YEAH, I STUDIED HIM.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.983
ONCE WE GOT INSIDE THE ELEVATOR,
IT HIT ME.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.217
HE DIDN'T HAVE A TOOL BOX.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.954
I ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING,
WHO HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SEE.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.723
HE WOULDN'T ANSWER.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.958
I...HURRIED INTO MY APARTMENT

10:24.992 --> 10:27.761
AND DOUBLE-BOLTED THE DOOR.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.730
>> I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO COME DOWN TO THE PRECINCT

10:29.763 --> 10:32.666
TO SIT WITH THE SKETCH ARTIST.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.433
>> YOU THINK
IF I CALLED THE POLICE,

10:33.466 --> 10:35.335
SHE MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE?

10:37.805 --> 10:39.272
>> NO.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.408
>> ANY SOLID LEADS
OFF THE SKETCH?

10:41.441 --> 10:43.376
>> STILL SEPARATING
THE KOOKS FROM THE CRANKS.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.444
>> WHERE'S MORAN?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.446
>> HE LEFT WITH OUR FILES.
YOU WANT ME TO CALL HIM?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.215
>> LET'S WAIT
UNTIL WE HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.717
>> GRAB YOUR JACKET.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.118
SOMEONE MATCHING THE SKETCH
IS GETTING CHASED

10:51.151 --> 10:52.953
BY A GROUP OF YOUNG MEN
OUT FOR BLOOD.

10:54.454 --> 10:59.392
[police sirens]

10:59.426 --> 11:03.831
[tires screeching]

11:17.845 --> 11:19.446
HEY, HEY, HEY, STOP!

11:19.479 --> 11:20.447
>> BACK UP!
>> AH!

11:20.480 --> 11:22.315

11:22.349 --> 11:25.252
>> [groaning]

11:25.285 --> 11:27.454
[sniffing]

11:27.487 --> 11:29.089
>> HE'S A LITTLE WORSE FOR WEAR,
BUT I THINK HE'S OUR GUY.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.191
>> I TOLD YOU

WHEN WE SPOTTED HIM.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.968
RECOGNIZED HIS UGLY FACE
FROM THE NEWS.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.070
HE WAS GOING INTO THE BUILDING
WHERE MY NANA LIVES.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.938
I WASN'T GONNA LET HIM
RAPE AND KILL HER.

>> LOCK PICKS.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.809
>> PERV DROPPED
THOSE IN THE STREETS.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.343
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

11:50.377 --> 11:52.813
>> HEY, KID, YOU DID GOOD.
DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK.

11:52.846 --> 11:53.646
>> I DON'T CARE.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.182
>> YEAH, WHAT
WOULD YOUR NANA SAY?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.184
>> YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

11:59.052 --> 11:59.887
>> YO, GET UP.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.323
>> OFFICER...
ALL RIGHT, PROCESS HIM.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.792
PUT HIM IN LOCKUP.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.860
>> HEY, THANK YOU.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.895
>> THANK YOU FOR WHAT?

12:07.928 --> 12:09.096
>> SAVING MY LIFE.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.231
>> CAN'T SAY
THAT I'M GLAD I DID.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.076
>> LOOK AT ALL THIS DNA.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.145
>> YOU GONNA ASK ME SOMETHING?

12:25.178 --> 12:27.014
>> WHAT'S THERE TO ASK?
WE HAVE YOUR SHEET.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.149
TRESPASSING AND B & E'S.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.385
>> WHEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,
YOU STARTED WINDOW PEEPING.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.821
WORKING UP THE COURAGE
TO GO INSIDE

12:33.854 --> 12:34.855
AND SHOW THEM WHO'S BOSS?

12:34.888 --> 12:37.390
IT'S ALL IN YOUR JACKET, STEFAN.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.326
>> DON'T GET IT TWISTED.
I WASN'T TRYING TO GET LUCKY.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.462
>> YOU CALL RAPING WOMEN
GETTING LUCKY?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.964
OR IS IT WHEN YOU TORTURE THEM?

12:43.997 --> 12:46.333
YOU GET JUICED OFF
HEARING THEM SCREAM.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.500
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

12:47.534 --> 12:51.338

PAYS ATTENTION TO YOU, HUH?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.173
CAN'T KEEP A JOB.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.142
VIOLENT MAN, VIOLENT TEMPER.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.577
YOU PEEK IN WINDOWS
AND YOU DREAM ABOUT

12:57.610 --> 12:59.546
ALL THOSE STUCK-UP BITCHES
WHO TURNED YOU DOWN.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.248

13:01.281 --> 13:02.449
>> STEFAN, YOU WERE SEEN.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.518
WE GOT A WITNESS.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.087
WE HAVE DNA.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.257
>> NO WAY IT'S MINE.
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING LIKE THAT.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.993
AND I ALWAYS WEAR GLOVES.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.533
>> OF COURSE YOU DO.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.370
AND YOU'RE NOT STUPID.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.408
>> EH,
I THINK I NEED A LAWYER.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.577

>> NAH, RAW'S
WHAT HAPPENS IN LOCK-DOWN

13:35.215 --> 13:36.349

GONNA DO IT TO YOU.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.623
>> DON'T TOUCH ME!
>> SHH. DON'T SAY THAT.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.193
AND NEVER FIGHT BACK
WHEN THEY COME FOR YOU.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.195
[scuffling]

13:48.228 --> 13:50.130
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENS.
>> LET GO OF ME!

13:50.163 --> 13:51.431
>> EH?

13:51.464 --> 13:52.599
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT HITS YOU.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.367
YOU BETTER GET USED TO
THIS POSITION,

13:54.401 --> 13:56.436
'CAUSE THEY LIKE TO COME BACK
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

13:56.469 --> 14:00.941
>> GET OFF OF ME!

14:00.974 --> 14:01.674

>> WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.351
>> SOCIAL WORKERS
PUT IT IN HIS FILE,

14:11.384 --> 14:12.519
HIS BIGGEST FEAR WAS PRISON.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.254
WE FIGURED STICK FIRST,
CARROT LATER.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.223
>> WELL, THAT STUNT IS GROUNDS
FOR AN ASSAULT CHARGE

14:16.256 --> 14:17.357
WHILE IN CUSTODY.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.892
>> I'D LIKE
TO SEE HIS LAWYERS TRY.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.227
>> HE DID ASK FOR ONE.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.229
>> THINKING YOU NEED
A LAWYER, AND ASKING FOR ONE

14:22.262 --> 14:23.330
IS DEBATABLE.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.298
HE'S AN IDIOT, BUT IS HE GUILTY?

14:25.332 --> 14:27.300
>> YOU ALL OVERHEARD HIM
SLIP UP WITH THE GLOVES.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.536
>> WELL, I'M HAVING TROUBLE
RECONCILING THAT JELLY FISH

14:29.569 --> 14:31.638
WITH THE KIND OF MAN THAT
BRUTALLY MURDERED FIVE WOMEN.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.207
>> A LOT OF SHORT-TERM
SERIAL KILLERS FALL APART

14:34.241 --> 14:35.408
WHEN THEY GET PINCHED.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.010

REPEATERS TO TALK TO YOU,

14:38.946 --> 14:40.080
YOU EITHER GOTTA
CATCH THEM IN THE ACT,

14:40.113 --> 14:41.214
OR AFTER A FRESH KILL.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.184

>> I'D LIKE TO INDICT WITH MORE

14:49.422 --> 14:51.558
THAN JUST THREE PUBIC HAIRS
AND A PARTIAL CONFESSION.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.692
>> OKAY, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.261
>> FIND THE MURDER KIT.

THE ONLY ONE GETTING BURIED.

>> YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.272
I'M PRETTY SURE
I TOOK YOU OFF THIS CASE.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.340
>> WE HAD A LEAD AND RAN IT.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.976
>> WITHOUT INFORMING MORAN.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.043
>> THE GUY SAYS HE LIKES
TO WORK ALONE.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.379
>> I DON'T BELIEVE
I WAS TALKING TO YOU, DETECTIVE.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.714
WELL, THE WORD'S OUT.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.985
THE PRESS BLINDSIDED ME ABOUT A
SERIAL KILLER LOOSE IN THE CITY,

15:18.018 --> 15:19.987
AND THE DNA HE LEFT BEHIND.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.588

THIS IS SVU GRANDSTANDING.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.628
AND NOW
YOU'VE GOT A POOCH SCREW.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.730
>> IT'S ANYTHING BUT, SIR.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.501
AND IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED,
WE HAVE A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.568
>> DID HE CONFESS?

15:35.602 --> 15:38.038
>> WE'RE STILL TALKING TO HIM.
>> WHICH MEANS NO.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.339
>> WE'LL GET IT DONE, CHIEF.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.108
>> YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT THE OTHER VICTIMS

15:41.141 --> 15:43.010
TILL MORAN SET YOU STRAIGHT.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.279
HE LINKED THESE CASES TOGETHER
ON HIS OWN TIME,

15:46.313 --> 15:48.048
WITH A KID IN THE HOSPITAL.

DAMN BUSINESS.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.228
>> FINISH THAT INTERROGATION,

16:01.261 --> 16:03.730
AND THEN TRANSPORT THE SUSPECT
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

TAKE YOUR COMMAND,

>> ONLY IF
WE DON'T CLOSE THE CASE.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.404
ALL ONE P.P. CARES ABOUT
ARE RESULTS.

16:11.438 --> 16:15.508
NEVER FORGET THAT.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.479
>> WHERE'D HE GO?

16:21.348 --> 16:22.682
>> WHAT THE HELL?

16:22.715 --> 16:25.018
THE UNIS WERE SUPPOSED
TO SEARCH HIM.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.077
>> YOU'RE NOT COMING?

16:50.110 --> 16:51.111
>> I CALLED MAJOR CRIMES.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.345
THEY SAID
MORAN'S AT THE HOSPITAL,

16:52.379 --> 16:53.780
I'M JUST GONNA LET HIM
KNOW WHERE THINGS STAND.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.116
>> STEFAN CONFESSED, ELLIOT.
IT'S DONE.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.617
MAKE SURE YOU TELL HIM THAT.

17:09.229 --> 17:13.133
>> I APOLOGIZE FOR INTRUDING
ON YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.267
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.341
>> HOW LONG'S
SHE BEEN LIKE THIS?

17:21.374 --> 17:24.277
>> FIVE MONTHS,
THREE WEEKS, AND TWO DAYS.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.549
>> YOU MIND ME ASKING
HOW IT HAPPENED?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.553
>> I'D JUST LINKED TWO
OF THE VICTIMS...

17:34.854 --> 17:36.589
BACK AND FORTH AT QUANTICO,

17:36.623 --> 17:39.392
AND I GOT THE FEDS
TELLING ME I GOT THE GIFT.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.595
I GOT A FED-UP WIFE
TELLING ME SHE'S HAD ENOUGH.

17:43.796 --> 17:48.435
SHE TOOK OFF
WITH JOY IN THE BACK SEAT.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.869
>> CAR ACCIDENT.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.205
>> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY
WERE GONE UNTIL HIGHWAY PATROL

17:52.239 --> 17:53.840
KNOCKED ON MY DOOR.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.408
>> YOUR WIFE?

17:58.711 --> 18:01.748
>> MY WIFE...DIED ON IMPACT.

18:01.781 --> 18:06.386

18:15.862 --> 18:18.598
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DATING BOYS
THAT I DON'T LIKE.

18:18.631 --> 18:23.670
DECIDING WHAT SHE WANTS TO BE
WHEN SHE GROWS UP.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.139
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO HA--

18:28.441 --> 18:31.544
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE A LIFE.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.294
>> SOLVING THE CASE ISN'T
GONNA BRING YOUR FAMILY BACK.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.163
>> YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

18:50.197 --> 18:54.334
>> THIS OBSESSION IS--
IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.536
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
ABOUT THE VICTIMS, EITHER.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.371
>> SINCE WHEN?

18:58.405 --> 18:59.672
>> SINCE YOU STARTED
BLAMING THE KILLER

18:59.706 --> 19:00.807
FOR YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.742
THEY'RE COLLATERAL DAMAGE
THAT HE'S GOT TO PAY FOR.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.645
>> YOU'RE WRONG.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.480
>> YOU PULL
AWAY FROM YOUR SQUAD.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.683
YOU DON'T WORK WITH ANY PARTNER.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.719
YOU DON'T NEED--
OR YOU WON'T ACCEPT--

19:12.752 --> 19:14.287
ANY OTHER KIND OF HELP.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.822
AND THE VICTIMS PAY FOR IT.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.759
>> LOOK, I CAN STILL
DO MY DAMN JOB.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.194
>> WHILE YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO BLAME,

19:21.228 --> 19:25.232
HOW MANY THINGS
HAVE YOU MISSED?

19:25.265 --> 19:26.899
SOMETHING THAT FRESH EYES
WOULD'VE CAUGHT.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.504
>> I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.906
>> WELL, AFTER FIVE MURDERS,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD FIND OUT.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.544
>> HEY, HEY.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.216
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

19:43.250 --> 19:45.885
>> A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.654
STEFAN HENRIQUES.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.789
>> TELL ME YOU WEREN'T
TRYING TO CUT ME OUT OF THIS.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.558
>> YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T
GIVE US MUCH OF AN OPTION.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.560
NOW WE WANT
TO CATCH THIS SON-OF-A-BITCH

19:53.593 --> 19:54.827
JUST AS BADLY AS YOU DO.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.230
>> ENOUGH TO, UH...

19:57.264 --> 19:58.798
LEAK SOME DNA EVIDENCE
TO THE PRESS?

19:58.831 --> 19:59.999
>> WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE,

20:00.032 --> 20:01.868
NOBODY FROM MY UNIT TALKED
TO A REPORTERS.

20:01.901 --> 20:06.639
>> [phone ringing]

20:06.673 --> 20:07.874
>> IS STEFAN OUR BOY?

20:07.907 --> 20:10.310
>> HE FITS YOUR PROFILE,
AND HE CONFESSED.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.278
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.879
>> YEAH,
I'D PROBABLY BUY THAT...

20:12.912 --> 20:15.382
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER BODY.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.924
>> WHAT DO WE HAVE?
>> A MESS.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.025
>> HE'S NEVER
BURNED IT UP BEFORE.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.927
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'S OUR GUY?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.996
>> A SMALL PIECE OF KNOTTED ROPE
SURVIVED THE BLAZE.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.432
GIVEN THE VICTIM'S POSITION,

20:32.465 --> 20:33.900
I'D HAVE TO SAY
SHE WAS HOG-TIED,

20:33.933 --> 20:35.302
CONSISTENT WITH OUR KILLER.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.369
>> WHAT KIND OF ACCELERANT
DID HE USE?

20:36.403 --> 20:38.538
>> ALCOHOL AND STARTER FLUID.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.607
HE DOUSED HER AND LIT HER UP.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.375
>> TELL ME SHE WASN'T
STILL ALIVE.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.843
>> I WON'T KNOW THAT
UNTIL I LOOK AT HER LUNGS.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.512
>> WILL YOU BE ABLE
TO DETERMINE TIME OF DEATH?

20:45.545 --> 20:47.314
>> I'LL DO MY BEST.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.981
SHALL I BE EXPECTING
MORE OF THESE?

20:49.015 --> 20:50.049
>> YES.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.018
WE'VE LEFT HIM NO CHOICE.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.521
YOU KNOW WHY HE SET HER ON FIRE?

20:54.554 --> 20:55.955
>> BECAUSE WE FOUND HIS DNA.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.325
>> AND THEN BRAGGED ABOUT IT
ON THE EVENING NEWS.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.299
>> ANY CHANCE STEFAN HENRIQUES
DID THE HOMICIDE

21:06.333 --> 21:08.401
BEFORE HE WAS COLLARED?
>> NO, SIR.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.903
THE M.E. CONFIRMED
THE LUNGS WERE SCORCHED.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.506
SHE WAS BURNED ALIVE
WHILE HE WAS IN CUSTODY.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.744
>> AND STILL NO IDEA
WHERE THE PRESS LEAK CAME FROM?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.912
>> MY SQUAD,
THE M.E.'S OFFICE, AND THE LAB

21:19.946 --> 21:21.481
ALL KNEW
ABOUT THE COLLECTED HAIRS.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.450
20, 30 PEOPLE COULD'VE
TIPPED THE MEDIA.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.385
>> WELL, PLUG THE LEAK.

21:25.418 --> 21:28.054
WE CAN'T AFFORD ANY MORE
ATTENTION FROM THESE JACKHOLES.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.622
>> WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO WASTE ANY MORE TIME, CHIEF.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.692
STEFAN HENRIQUES
IS NOT OUR KILLER.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.327
>> WHAT'S HE CONFESSING TO?

21:34.361 --> 21:35.428
>> BURGLARY.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.397
THE OLD MAN FOUGHT HIM.
HE HIT HIM BACK.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.399
THE VICTIM DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.967
>> YOUR SQUAD SCREWED THIS UP.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.502
>> CHIEF...

21:42.535 --> 21:44.103
CHIEF...

21:44.136 --> 21:46.339
THEY GOT A LEAD, THEY WORKED IT.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.074
I WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING, SO WOULD YOU.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.776
>> I GAVE THIS CASE TO YOU.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.943
>> THEN LET ME WORK IT HERE.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.112
>> FINE.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.081
BUT MAKE IT HAPPEN.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.450
FAST.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.889
>> YOU SAW THE LIGHT?

22:04.757 --> 22:06.092
>> MAYBE.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.960
>> YOU'RE NOT
A TEAM PLAYER, MORAN.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.998
YOU HOLD ANYTHING ELSE BACK,
I'LL HAVE YOUR ASS.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.824
>> SO WHERE ARE WE?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.392
>> THE VICTIMS
ARE ALL THE SAME AGE,

22:39.426 --> 22:41.761
BUT THEY VARY RACIALLY,
SOCIALLY, AND PROFESSIONALLY.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.863
>> YEAH, PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES
ARE ALL OVER THE MAP, TOO.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.866
TALL, SHORT, THIN, FAT,
EYE COLOR, HAIR COLOR--

22:46.899 --> 22:48.635
THIS GUY IS NOT CHOOSY.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.637
>> NO, OKAY. NOW, LET'S
LOOK AT THE SIMILARITIES

22:50.670 --> 22:52.739
BETWEEN THE WOMEN
THAT HE DIDN'T SEXUALLY ASSAULT.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.006
>> WHY?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.675
>> 'CAUSE THEIR DEVIATIONS
RULE HIS BEHAVIOR.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.476
LOOK AT THE QUEENS VICTIM.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.678
IN HER DMV PHOTO,
SHE'S A BLONDE.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.948
IN THE MORGUE PHOTO,

23:01.981 --> 23:03.816
SHE'S A REDHEAD,
RIGHT DOWN TO HER EYEBROWS.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.619
>> SHE DYED HER HAIR.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.488
CURTAINS DON'T MATCH THE RUG.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.623
>> AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN
THAT UNTIL HE GOT HER NAKED.

23:10.657 --> 23:11.958
>> TURNS OUT CASEY CHAPMAN

23:11.991 --> 23:13.493
BOUGHT NEW BOOBS.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.962
>> THERE YOU GO; HE'S A PURIST.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.631
IF THEY'RE NOT NATURAL,
HE'S NOT GONNA RAPE THEM.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.700
>> AND HE GLUES THEM SHUT
WHEN HE DOESN'T WANT THEM.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.437
>> OUR PROFILE IS WRONG.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.938
THIS GUY--

23:25.972 --> 23:27.807
HE'S NOT LATE 20s, EARLY 30s.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.542
HE'S OVER 40.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.210
HIS PSYCHO-SEXUAL TYPE
WAS SET AT PUBERTY

23:31.243 --> 23:33.713
WHEN COSMETIC SURGERY
WAS LESS COMMON.

23:33.746 --> 23:34.914
>> AND NO MIDDLE-AGED MAN
IS SUDDENLY

23:34.947 --> 23:36.749
GONNA BECOME A SEXUAL SADIST.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.584
THIS GUY'S BEEN RAPING
FOR DECADES.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.751
>> BRUSHING UP
ON POLICE PROCEDURE,

23:38.785 --> 23:40.887
FORENSIC SCIENCE, LAW...

23:40.920 --> 23:42.889
FANTASIZING, READING UP
ON OTHER SERIAL KILLERS--

23:42.922 --> 23:44.457
THEIR VARIOUS EXPLOITS.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.459
>> SERIAL KILLING'S
A BOOMING BUSINESS.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.127
CHECK THE TRUE CRIME SECTION
IN ANY BOOK STORE.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.830
>> FAMILIAL DNA CAME BACK
WITH THREE POSSIBLE HITS.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.465
A 16-ALLELE MATCH

23:52.499 --> 23:55.535
TO ANGELA OCURRO, TYRONE
BECKWITH, AND DAVID PAIGE.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.809
>> WHAT THE HELL IS IT
THIS TIME?

24:02.842 --> 24:05.144
I PAY THAT BITCH
THE FIRST OF EVERY MONTH.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.914
DNA SAYS IT'S NOT EVEN MY KID.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.649
AND I STILL
GOTTA PAY CHILD SUPPORT.

24:09.682 --> 24:10.917
IS THAT FAIR?

24:10.950 --> 24:13.185
>> YEAH, WE KNOW YOU GOT BONED,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.987
>> THEN WHY?
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY BROTHERS?

24:15.021 --> 24:16.489
>> NO.

24:16.523 --> 24:17.757
>> THIS FILE SAYS DIFFERENT.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.058
>> AND I GOT OPEN MURDERS
HE LOOKS GOOD FOR.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.493
>> WELL, THAT'S CRAP.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.028
'CAUSE MY BROTHER
NEVER KILLED ANYBODY.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.696
>> WE'RE GONNA STILL NEED
TO TALK TO HIM.

24:23.730 --> 24:24.997
>> WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.033
'CAUSE I BURIED CRAIG
EIGHT MONTHS AGO.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.703
>> THIS IS NOT RIGHT.
>> SIX DEAD WOMEN, MUNCH.

24:30.737 --> 24:33.205
>> THAT MAN HAD A GENETIC TEST
TO ESTABLISH PATERNITY.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.174
AND WE USE HIS RESULTS
WITHOUT HIS CONSENT

24:35.207 --> 24:36.843
TO TRY AND CATCH A KILLER.
>> UH-HUH.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.545
>> THAT'S INVASION OF PRIVACY,
MAN.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.813
>> SIX DEAD WOMEN, MUNCH.

24:40.847 --> 24:41.714
LET'S GO.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.850
>> WHY YOU ASKING
ABOUT MY FAMILY FOR?

24:43.883 --> 24:45.752
>> MISS, JUST TELL US HOW MANY
BROTHERS YOU HAVE, ALL RIGHT?

24:45.785 --> 24:46.686
>> THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.955
>> MISS OCURRO,
TALK, OR YOU'RE GOING IN.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.657
>> FOR WHAT?
I AIN'T DO ANYTHING.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.892
SO GO TO HELL.
>> WHOA, WHOA, OKAY.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.828
NOW, DO YOU THINK
I'M MESSING AROUND WITH YOU?

24:57.964 --> 24:59.799
>> ALL RIGHT.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.233
I HAVE FOUR BROTHERS, ALL RIGHT?

25:01.267 --> 25:03.069
>> WHERE ARE THEY?
>> I DON'T KNOW.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.303
>> OKAY, YOU'RE GOING IN.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.205
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.274
TWO OF THEM ARE AWAY AT SCHOOL,

25:08.307 --> 25:10.777
ONE WORKS FOR THE AIRLINE,
AND ONE IS DOWN SOUTH.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.145
>> I WANT NAMES,
ADDRESSES, ALIASES.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.882
DON'T MAKE ME HAVE TO COME BACK.

25:15.915 --> 25:16.983
>> NAME AND ADDRESS.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.818
>> IT'LL COST YOU.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.020
50 BUCKS
ON MY COMMISSARY ACCOUNT.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.055
>> YOU'D SELL OUT
YOUR BROTHER FOR 50 BUCKS?

25:23.089 --> 25:25.558
YOU ARE A STAND-UP GUY.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.960
>> IF I THOUGHT HE DID IT,
I'D KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.862
>> IF YOU KNOW HE'S INNOCENT,
GIVE ME HIS NAME.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.598
50 BUCKS, MAN.
I NEED THAT.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.900
I'M CARBED OUT IN HERE, MAN.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.635
>> YOU HAVE MY WORD.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.306
>> HIS NAME IS TYRESE.

25:40.339 --> 25:45.011
LANCE CORPORAL TYRESE BECKWITH.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.846
>> MILITARY CONFIRMED TYRESE

25:46.879 --> 25:49.015
IS ON ACTIVE DUTY
IN AFGHANISTAN.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.282
HASN'T HAD LEAVE IN A YEAR.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.318
>> CRAIG PAIGE OD'D LAST SUMMER.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.787
M.E. FAXED OVER
THE AUTOPSY RESULTS.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.889
ALL RIGHT, SO THAT LEAVES US
WITH THE OCURRO BROTHERS:

25:56.923 --> 25:58.858
LUKE, MARK, JOHN, AND JAMES.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.792
>> ALL SAINTS, I'M SURE.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.193
>> THEIR FATHER
WAS A PART-TIME MINISTER.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.929
>> CURRENT WHEREABOUTS OF
THESE GENTLEMEN?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.864
>> MARK OCURRO
WORKS FOR THE AIRLINES.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.933
TWO ARRESTS FOR ASSAULTS,
CHARGES WERE DROPPED.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.001
LUKE OCURRO LIVES
IN NORTH CAROLINA.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.036
HE'S A FARMER.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.738
>> I THINK WE CAN RULE HIM OUT.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.240
>> ANGELA OCURRO TOLD US THAT
HER OTHER TWO BROTHERS

26:14.273 --> 26:16.108
WERE IN SCHOOL, SHE LIED.

26:16.142 --> 26:19.378
JAMES IS IN REHAB,
AND JOHN...I HAVE YET TO FIND.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.180
>> THAT LEAVES OUR AIRLINE GUY.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.083
MUNCH, BRING UP
THE LAST THREE CRIME PHOTOS

26:24.116 --> 26:25.685
ON THE SCAN STATION, WOULD YOU?

26:25.718 --> 26:27.086
>> MM-HMM.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.689
WHAT'RE YOU LOOKING FOR?

26:29.722 --> 26:30.857
>> BAGGAGE.

26:30.890 --> 26:35.828
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING HERE.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.765
>> APRIL SILVA AND CASEY CHAPMAN
HAD JUST COME BACK FROM TRIPS.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.933
>> ONE HAD
RECENTLY BEEN ON VACATION,

26:40.967 --> 26:42.301
BUT THERE WERE
NO CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS

26:42.334 --> 26:43.970
FOR THE AIRLINE TICKETS.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.938
>> WELL, SOMEBODY COULD'VE
BOUGHT THE TICKETS FOR THEM.

26:45.972 --> 26:46.806
>> OR IF WERE A BUSINESS TRIP,

26:46.839 --> 26:47.807
THEIR EMPLOYER
WOULD'VE PAID FOR IT.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.076
>> DO WE KNOW WHAT OCURRO DOES
FOR THE AIRLINE?

26:50.109 --> 26:52.244
>> IF HE'S A TICKETING AGENT,
YOU COULD TRACK THEIR TRAVEL.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.680
>> A LITTLE
MORE PERSONAL CONTACT,

26:53.713 --> 26:54.747
MAYBE A FLIGHT ATTENDANT?

26:54.781 --> 26:55.982
>> OCURRO'S A DELIVERY MAN.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.084
HE RETURNS LOST LUGGAGE.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.154
>> HOLA.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.856
WE FOUND
YOUR MISSING LUGGAGE, MA'AM.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.992
>> I THOUGHT
I'D NEVER GET MY STUFF BACK.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.128
>> IT'S KINDA HEAVY,
WHERE DO YOU WANT IT?

27:09.161 --> 27:10.897
>> IN THE BEDROOM.

27:14.934 --> 27:15.868
>> YOU WANNA CHECK IT?

27:15.902 --> 27:17.870
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING
IS THERE BEFORE I GO?

27:17.904 --> 27:19.338
>> I'M SURE IT'S FINE.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.207
I'M JUST GLAD YOU FOUND IT.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.975
I'D HATE TO HAVE
TO BUY NEW CLOTHES.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.044
>> YOU WON'T NEED NEW CLOTHES,
I PROMISE.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.312
>> OH!

27:26.345 --> 27:28.147
[struggling]

27:28.180 --> 27:29.782
>> DON'T MOVE.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.286
>> YOU WANT THE HONORS?
IT'S YOUR COLLAR.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.055
>> THANKS, DETECTIVE.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.958
MARK OCURRO,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

27:38.991 --> 27:41.093
FOR SIX COUNTS
OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.965
FIND ANYTHING?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.399
>> THE MOTHER LODE.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.702
ROPE, GLOVES, GLUE...

27:51.003 --> 27:53.105
CONDOMS,
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.373
>> WELL, WELL, WELL.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.908
THAT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY'S MURDER KIT.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.309
>> HEY, IT GETS EVEN BETTER.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.079
ALL THE FEMALE NAMES CIRCLED.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.182
OH, YEAH.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.921
GOT YOU NOW.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.959
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

28:19.832 --> 28:22.468
>> SO YOU FEEL
LIKE TALKING, MR. OCURRO?

28:22.501 --> 28:23.936
>> YOU PULLED A GUN ON ME.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.271
>> YOU ASSAULTED
A POLICE OFFICER.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.239
>> SHE DIDN'T IDENTIFY HERSELF.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.141
I'M NOT PSYCHIC.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.743
>> NO, YOU'RE PSYCHOPATHIC.

28:33.980 --> 28:34.981
>> WHO ARE THEY?

28:36.148 --> 28:38.350
>> THESE ARE ALL YOUNG WOMEN
WITH ONE THING IN COMMON.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.887
THEY WERE CHOSEN,
TORTURED, AND MURDERED...

28:40.920 --> 28:41.954
BY YOU.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.255
>> NO.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.857
I LOVE WOMEN,
AND ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME

28:44.891 --> 28:45.958
WOULD TELL YOU THAT.

28:45.992 --> 28:49.261
ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE REAL YOU
IS DEAD, MR. OCURRO.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.999
>> WELL...

28:54.100 --> 28:55.968
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANY OF THEM BEFORE.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.169
>> WELL, YOU DELIVERED
LOST LUGGAGE

28:57.203 --> 28:58.270
TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM.

28:58.304 --> 29:01.407
>> MUST BE A DREAM JOB
FOR A MAN WITH YOUR TALENTS.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.977
UNLIMITED ACCESS
TO AN ENDLESS VICTIM POOL.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.980
>> I DELIVER
HUNDREDS OF LOST BAGS.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.950
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THEM.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.518
I FEEL BAD FOR THEIR FAM--

29:12.551 --> 29:14.086
>> YOU DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.858
I MEAN, HE FEELS EXCITEMENT WHEN
HE GOES UP TO THEIR DOOR...

29:20.092 --> 29:22.995
WONDERING IF SHE'S THE ONE.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.031
IF SHE'S RIGHT, IF SHE'S MINE.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.166
>> AND WHEN HE MAKES HIS MOVE...

29:27.199 --> 29:29.201
SHE REJECTS HIM, SEE.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.904
YELLS AT HIM.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.240
SO HE GETS ENRAGED,
AND HE PUNCHES HER IN THE FACE

29:34.273 --> 29:35.374
JUST TO TEACH HER A LESSON.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.110
>> YEAH, AND SEEING HER
LYING THERE, BLEEDING, HELPLESS.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.278
THAT TURNS HIM ON.
>> MM-HMM.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.313
>> HE LUSTS AFTER HER.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.515
>> AND THEN HE TIES HER UP.

29:43.549 --> 29:47.119
AND THEN SHE IS HIS
FOR AS LONG AS HE WANTS.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.121
AND WHEN HE'S FINISHED...

29:49.155 --> 29:51.157
HE LOOKS AT WHAT HE'S DONE.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.860
>> AT THIS BROKEN, BATTERED,
DEAD THING

29:53.893 --> 29:55.094
THAT YOU MADE.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.929
AND YOU'RE PUMPED WITH POWER.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.865
SO PROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

29:58.898 --> 30:00.166
THAT YOU JUST GOTTA SHOW IT OFF.

30:01.233 --> 30:04.203
SO YOU POSE THE VICTIM
FOR WHOEVER FINDS HER.

30:04.236 --> 30:07.239
>> YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.876
>> WELL, WE WILL BECAUSE WE'RE
SEARCHING YOUR APARTMENT.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.246
WE'RE GOING THROUGH
YOUR PRIVATE THINGS.

30:16.148 --> 30:21.353
>> HOW'S IT FEEL
TO BE VIOLATED, MR. OCURRO?

30:23.956 --> 30:25.357
>> I WANT A LAWYER.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.094
NOW.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.630
>> YOU CAN EAT OFF THIS FLOOR.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.065
>> THIS GUY'S A SQUIRREL.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.902
>> I DON'T SEE ANY PORN.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.536
>> IT'S GOTTA BE HERE.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.238
THE WAY HE TRUSTS HIS VICTIMS,

30:39.271 --> 30:41.373
HE GOT HIS INSPIRATION
SOMEWHERE.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.509
>> FIN, CHECK THESE BOOKS.

30:46.145 --> 30:49.448
>> HOMICIDE, AUTOPSY,
AND FORENSIC TEXTBOOKS.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.984
HELL, HE EVEN PULLED
COURT TRANSCRIPTS

30:52.018 --> 30:54.220
ON SERIAL KILLERS
FOR HIS READING PLEASURE.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.256
NOT YOUR TYPE OF ART?

30:57.289 --> 30:58.624
>> NOT THE ARTWORK, THE WIRES.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.159
THEY'RE TWISTED.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.529
YOU THINK AN
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE LIKE OCURRO

31:03.562 --> 31:04.663
WOULD TOLERATE THAT?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.899
>> NOT WITHOUT A GOOD REASON.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.978
>> NOW, THAT'S TWISTED.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.082
>> SO MY CLIENT LIKES TO READ;
THAT'S NOT A CRIME.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.018
>> WELL, HE ALSO LIKES
TO TORTURE AND MURDER WOMEN.

31:29.355 --> 31:30.489
>> YOU CAN'T PROVE A CONNECTION.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.491
A LOT OF PEOPLE COLLECT
THESE MAGAZINES.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.393
>> BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM LEFT
THREE PUBIC HAIRS

31:34.426 --> 31:36.495
IN CASEY CHAPMAN'S
APARTMENT, COUNSELOR.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.965
>> DID WE FORGET
TO MENTION THE DNA MATCHES?

31:40.132 --> 31:41.300
>> YOU'RE SCREWED.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.207
>> THE PEOPLE WILL SHOW PROOF

31:48.240 --> 31:51.343
THAT THE DEFENDANT TORTURED,
RAPED, AND MURDERED SIX WOMEN.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.013
DNA CONCLUSIVELY
LINKS MR. OCURRO

31:54.046 --> 31:55.381
TO THE CASEY CHAPMAN HOMICIDE,

31:55.414 --> 31:58.184
WHICH IS IDENTICAL
TO FIVE PREVIOUS MURDERS.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.552
>> ARE YOU CHARGING ALL SIX
BASED ON PROBATIVE LINKAGE?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.421
>> VICTIM BONDAGE
IS EXACTLY THE SAME.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.323
EVEN THE USE OF THE GLUE
IS UNIQUE.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.658
>> THE PEOPLE CONTEND ONE MAN
COMMITTED ALL SIX MURDERS.

32:06.692 --> 32:09.128
>> ARE YOU OBJECTING
TO PATTERN TESTIMONY?

32:09.161 --> 32:10.196
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT, YOUR HONOR.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.331
ONE MAN MAY HAVE DONE IT,
BUT IT WASN'T MY CLIENT.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.200
>> WE HAVE HIS DNA, COUNSELOR.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.068
>> MR. OCURRO ANSWERED A CALL
OF NATURE

32:16.102 --> 32:18.137
WHEN HE DELIVERED
MS. CHAPMAN'S SUITCASE.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.071
THE PUBIC HAIRS COULD EASILY

32:19.105 --> 32:20.339
HAVE TRANSFERRED
FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.609
>> IF HE USED THE FACILITIES,
WHY DIDN'T WE FIND HIS PRINTS?

32:23.642 --> 32:25.544
>> MY CLIENT
DOESN'T ALWAYS WASH HIS HANDS.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.980
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE TO,
SINCE HE WEARS GLOVES.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.316
A SEARCH OF HIS VAN TURNED UP
A MURDER KIT

32:30.349 --> 32:32.284
OF ROPE, LATEX, AND GLUE.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.585
>> IT'S AIRLINE POLICY,
YOUR HONOR.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.254
BAGS MUST BE RETURNED UNDAMAGED.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.689
>> AND HOW DOES HE USE THE
CONDOMS TO FIX THE DAMAGED BAGS?

32:37.723 --> 32:39.725
>> WELL, SINCE THEY WERE FOUND
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT,

32:39.758 --> 32:41.327
WE CAN ONLY ASSUME
THAT MR. OCURRO

32:41.360 --> 32:43.329
IS SEXUALLY ACTIVE
OR WANTS TO BE.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.430
>> THAT IS
A SPECIOUS EXPLANATION

32:44.463 --> 32:46.032
FOR RAPE, TORTURE, AND MURDER.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.334
>> FEEL FREE TO REBUT ON CROSS,
IF WE EVER GET THAT FAR.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.735
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING YET

32:49.768 --> 32:52.038
TO SUGGEST WE WON'T BE GOING
TO TRIAL, COUNSELOR.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.173
>> HOW ABOUT AN ALIBI
FOR THE CASEY CHAPMAN MURDER?

32:54.206 --> 32:55.441
I HAVE A WITNESS WHO SAYS

32:55.474 --> 32:58.377
MR. OCURRO NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE
AT THE VICTIM'S TIME OF DEATH.

32:58.410 --> 32:59.245
>> WHO?

32:59.278 --> 33:00.279
A GLUE SALESMAN?

33:00.312 --> 33:01.680
>> HIS MOTHER, ELENA OCURRO.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.082
>> COULD YOU
AT LEAST MAKE AN EFFORT

33:03.115 --> 33:04.316
TO FIND A MORE CREDIBLE WITNESS?

33:04.350 --> 33:05.351
>> WELL, WOULD YOU
ACCEPT THE TESTIMONY

33:05.384 --> 33:07.119
OF HER BRIDGE CLUB?

33:07.153 --> 33:09.255
I HAVE FIVE INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTS

33:09.288 --> 33:11.157
THAT ALL SUPPORT
MRS. OCURRO'S CLAIM.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.324
IF HE'S ALIBIED FOR ONE,

33:12.358 --> 33:13.525
HE'S ALIBIED FOR ALL,
YOUR HONOR.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.127
MS. CABOT SAID AS MUCH HERSELF.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.696
ONLY ONE MAN COMMITTED
THESE SIX HOMICIDES.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.366
I JUST HOPE THE DETECTIVES
CAN FIND HIM.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.334
>> SHE'S RIGHT, MS. CABOT.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.570
IF THE DEFENDANT'S ALIBI IS
VERIFIED,

33:24.603 --> 33:27.139
THEN LINKAGE IS BROKEN
AND I'LL HAVE TO DISMISS.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.440
[gavel bangs]

33:40.352 --> 33:41.787
[tapping]

33:41.820 --> 33:43.055
>> MRS. OCURRO.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.391
I'M DETECTIVE STABLER.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.293
DETECTIVE MORAN.
>> GOOD MORNING.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.794
>> THIS IS ABOUT MARK.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.429
COFFEE?

33:50.462 --> 33:51.330
>> NO, THANK YOU.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.133
>> I'M SORRY TO SAY MY SON
WAS WITH ME.

33:54.166 --> 33:57.103
I KNOW MY BOY BELONGS IN PRISON.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.770
I'VE KNOWN IT A LONG TIME.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.772
>> MRS. OCURRO, DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THESE MURDERS?

34:00.806 --> 34:02.474
>> NO.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.276
MARK CALLED OUT OF THE BLUE

34:04.310 --> 34:06.145
WANTING TO COME OVER.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.146
>> THAT UNUSUAL?

34:07.179 --> 34:08.314
>> YES.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.249
HE KNOWS I DON'T LIKE HIM.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.284
WHICH IS WHY
I INVITED MY BRIDGE CLUB OVER.

34:12.318 --> 34:13.419
>> HE SCARES YOU?

34:13.452 --> 34:15.754
>> HE ONCE TIED A CAT TO A BUS.

34:15.787 --> 34:18.524
HE DROPPED ANOTHER
FROM A SIXTH FLOOR WALK-UP.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.426
HE'S A MISTAKE,
I DON'T KNOW WHOSE--

34:20.459 --> 34:22.461
MINE OR GOD'S.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.396
>> DID HE LEAVE YOU APARTMENT
THAT DAY, MRS. OCURRO?

34:24.430 --> 34:25.464
>> NOT ONCE.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.133
>> HOW LONG DID HE STAY?

34:27.166 --> 34:28.467
>> THE WHOLE DAMN DAY.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.602
I COULDN'T WAIT FOR HIM
TO LEAVE.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.539
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> THANK YOU.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.777
>> AS THOROUGH AS OCURRO IS...

34:38.810 --> 34:40.312
NO ONE'S LUCK LASTS FOREVER.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.348
HE PLANNED THIS.
>> MM-HMM.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.415
HE LEARNS FROM EVERY KILL.

34:43.449 --> 34:44.683
WE GOT HIM ON A FEW HAIRS.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.586
IF HE WALKS, HE'S GONNA SHAVE
HIS HEAD AND WAX HIS GENITALS.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.887
>> HE READS THE SAME BOOKS
WE DO.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.456
HE HAD TO CREATE THIS ALIBI.

34:50.489 --> 34:51.723
>> YEAH, IT'S THE PERFECT ONE.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.260
WITH HIS MOTHER
WHEN CASEY CHAPMAN WAS MURDERED.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.496
>> HEY...

34:57.529 --> 34:58.897
THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW
WHEN SHE DIED

34:58.930 --> 35:01.567
IS BASED ON WARNER'S
CALCULATIONS ON DECOMPOSITION.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.471
>> MAYBE SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.240
>> DETERMINING TIME OF DEATH
ISN'T A PERFECT SCIENCE.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.876
THIS TISSUE PUTREFACTION

35:10.909 --> 35:12.444
IS CONSISTENT WITH MY FINDINGS.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.480
I COULD'VE BEEN A FEW HOURS OFF,
NOT A WHOLE DAY.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.415
>> IS THERE ANY WAY HE COULD'VE
ACCELERATED THE PROCESS?

35:16.448 --> 35:18.650
MAKE THE BODY LOOK LIKE
IT HAD BEEN DEAD LONGER?

35:18.684 --> 35:21.453
>> EXTREME HEAT OR WATER
CAN AFFECT DECOMP,

35:21.487 --> 35:22.888
BUT THERE WAS
NO EVIDENCE OF EITHER.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.423
IN FACT, THE WINDOW WAS OPEN.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.425
>> WHAT IF HE TURNED
THE THERMOSTAT UP

35:26.458 --> 35:28.160
WHILE HE WAS THERE,
AND THEN OPENED UP THE WINDOW

35:28.194 --> 35:29.228
TO THROW US OFF?

35:29.261 --> 35:31.797
>> RESIDENTIAL HEATING
DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH BTU'S

35:31.830 --> 35:33.632
TO CAUSE
THAT KIND OF RAPID DECAY.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.402
>> HOW ABOUT A KILN?

35:39.771 --> 35:43.342
KILNS CAN BE USED TO DRY WOOD,
MELT METALS, GLASSES.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.878
THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS A
MAXIMUM OUTPUT OF 2,000 DEGREES.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.547
IT'S GOT
ELECTRONIC PROGRAMMING

35:48.580 --> 35:51.450
FOR TEMPERATURE, FIRING TIME,
AND AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.352
>> SO HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO GET HOT?

35:53.385 --> 35:54.553
>> EIGHT TO TEN HOURS.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.888
BUT TWICE THAT LONG TO COOL OFF.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.925
>> SO IN ORDER
TO COVER HIS ACTIONS,

35:59.958 --> 36:01.727
OCURRO HAD TO COME BACK HERE
AND OPEN A WINDOW.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.694
>> HE HAD NO CHOICE.

36:02.728 --> 36:05.431
IF IT WAS STILL HOT
WHEN THE BODY WAS FOUND,

36:05.464 --> 36:06.532
WARNER WOULD'VE KNOWN.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.967
>> BUT WHY GO TO ALL THE TROUBLE
TO CREATE AN ALIBI,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.669
WHEN WE WEREN'T EVEN
ONTO HIM YET?

36:10.702 --> 36:12.438
