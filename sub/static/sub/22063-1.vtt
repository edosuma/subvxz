02:00.744 --> 02:02.182
And whenever my
photos are picked

02:02.184 --> 02:05.621
for the main story, his
face goes completely red.

02:05.623 --> 02:07.983
And he looks like
he wants to kill me.

02:07.985 --> 02:09.663
Well what does he expect?

02:09.664 --> 02:12.581
You're a much better
photographer than he is.

02:12.583 --> 02:15.622
Which is exactly why Paul
gave you the Anderson report.

02:15.624 --> 02:18.022
Yeah well it's
not 'til next year.

02:18.024 --> 02:20.585
I just hope it actually happens.

02:22.745 --> 02:24.823
Hey Ronnie, you wanna pee?

02:26.503 --> 02:28.464
I think that means yes.

02:41.983 --> 02:42.785
That's it.

02:50.424 --> 02:52.344
Ronnie, go.

03:01.025 --> 03:03.341
A lot of open space huh?

03:03.343 --> 03:05.103
It is beautiful.

03:05.105 --> 03:06.624
But very different.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.702
Living here will
save us a lot of money.

03:13.704 --> 03:16.423
And it's only an
hour to the city.

03:23.544 --> 03:24.343
Ronnie.

04:02.383 --> 04:03.581
Wow.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.261
I told you so.

04:05.263 --> 04:07.505
Wait 'til you see the inside.

04:10.345 --> 04:12.344
Welcome to your new home.

04:13.303 --> 04:15.983
Wow, this place is huge!

04:15.985 --> 04:18.305
How are we gonna fill it all?

04:19.745 --> 04:21.505
We have all the time

04:23.905 --> 04:25.223
in the world.

04:25.225 --> 04:26.024
Awe.

07:19.265 --> 07:20.065
John?

07:21.343 --> 07:22.983
John are you here?

07:22.985 --> 07:23.785
In here.

07:36.625 --> 07:39.503
We really need a yard sale.

07:39.505 --> 07:41.381
Oh, careful with the
hole in the corner.

07:41.383 --> 07:43.623
I saw a cockroach go in.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.623
Oh god, that's disgusting.

07:45.625 --> 07:46.943
Can you fix it?

07:46.945 --> 07:49.743
Yes ma'am, tomorrow
I'll fill it in.

07:49.745 --> 07:51.503
Listen, I was
just in the garden

07:51.505 --> 07:54.821
and I'm sure I someone standing
at the end of the road.

07:54.823 --> 07:57.063
They seemed to be staring at me.

07:57.065 --> 07:58.585
Curious neighbor.

07:59.503 --> 08:02.064
Or perhaps, the first incursions

08:03.064 --> 08:05.702
of the murderous villagers.

08:05.704 --> 08:07.302
Very funny.

08:07.304 --> 08:11.222
We'll see who's laughing
if someone breaks in.

08:11.224 --> 08:15.022
How 'bout you help me
take these to the attic.

08:15.024 --> 08:17.182
Do I look like a housemaid?

08:17.184 --> 08:19.662
You filthy misogynist.

08:19.664 --> 08:22.145
Filthy, slave driving, sexist...

08:23.024 --> 08:23.825
Thanks.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.383
This is the last.

08:40.385 --> 08:41.741
Oh great.

08:41.744 --> 08:43.825
We'll sort them out later.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.984
Oh, I desperately need a shower.

08:49.745 --> 08:52.625
Actually, so do you.

08:54.264 --> 08:55.704
I like the idea.

10:13.385 --> 10:14.504
Christ Ronnie.

10:47.784 --> 10:48.905
What the hell?

13:00.744 --> 13:01.543
Slowly.

13:03.144 --> 13:04.025
And slowly.

13:04.904 --> 13:05.705
Perfect.

13:06.584 --> 13:08.345
Stop fooling around.

13:10.304 --> 13:11.105
Stop it!

13:19.145 --> 13:19.944
Enough!

13:21.584 --> 13:23.022
What is that?

13:23.024 --> 13:25.023
Oh this is a
present for Ronnie.

13:25.025 --> 13:27.222
Hey Ronnie, come here boy.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.342
Here.

13:28.344 --> 13:29.143
Hey.

13:30.344 --> 13:32.182
I don't think he likes it.

13:32.184 --> 13:33.463
Obviously not.

13:35.825 --> 13:36.624
Smile.

16:09.065 --> 16:11.103
The basement is huge.

16:11.105 --> 16:14.141
That's a lot of space
for a dark room.

16:14.143 --> 16:16.661
The whole house is huge.

16:16.663 --> 16:19.022
I don't know how
we're gonna fill it.

16:19.024 --> 16:21.422
Well let's hope
that before long

16:21.424 --> 16:23.584
we find the creative subject.

16:25.183 --> 16:29.102
If it's a boy, what do
you think about Billy?

16:29.104 --> 16:31.502
No, it's gotta be macho like

16:31.504 --> 16:33.343
Jason or Vick or Chuck.

16:34.705 --> 16:36.983
And if it's a girl?

16:36.985 --> 16:37.784
A girl.

16:39.745 --> 16:43.585
Vanesser, Dalier, Kareen.

16:46.145 --> 16:48.023
Hey, I don't want
a scene tomorrow.

16:48.025 --> 16:49.421
Promise me.

16:49.423 --> 16:51.983
No, no, no, tomorrow
I'll go to the drug store,

16:51.985 --> 16:53.303
get some liquid Valium.

16:53.305 --> 16:54.983
She likes to drink right?

16:54.985 --> 16:56.425
You're so funny.

17:06.145 --> 17:08.501
Yes, I was calling about...

17:08.502 --> 17:11.141
He has some grin, he is great.

17:11.143 --> 17:12.502
That's great.

17:12.505 --> 17:13.421
I know.

17:13.423 --> 17:15.383
He's really interested.

17:15.385 --> 17:17.305
I will give you the contact.

17:18.265 --> 17:19.463
Awe it's amazing.

17:19.464 --> 17:20.703
Since I've been
here I haven't had

17:20.704 --> 17:21.941
so much inspiration.

17:21.943 --> 17:24.502
I'm not really sure
if I can sell them.

17:24.505 --> 17:25.943
And two of my latest paintings,

17:25.944 --> 17:28.502
I'm like just to have that
contact would be great.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.303
Yeah?

17:29.305 --> 17:30.701
Yeah.

17:30.703 --> 17:32.303
You know I
trust you, you're so great.

17:32.305 --> 17:33.104
Mmm mmm.

17:41.743 --> 17:42.783
Viola.

17:42.785 --> 17:44.381
What a service.

17:44.383 --> 17:46.301
Perfect.

17:46.303 --> 17:49.063
Oh thank you
Kareen, I'm honored.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.263
This house is huge.

17:54.385 --> 17:55.301
I'd have a panic
attack every time

17:55.303 --> 17:57.461
I opened the front door.

17:57.463 --> 17:58.463
Yeah the house is...

17:58.465 --> 18:00.221
It's exactly why we want it.

18:00.223 --> 18:03.823
It's large, great value,
and not in the city.

18:04.705 --> 18:05.465
Well,

18:06.625 --> 18:09.101
if you ever get fed up
of being a photographer,

18:09.103 --> 18:11.103
at least you know what to do.

18:11.105 --> 18:13.863
Mmm, Chef
Johnny has a ring to it.

18:13.865 --> 18:15.263
Well thank you both
for being so concerned

18:15.265 --> 18:16.544
about my career.

18:33.305 --> 18:34.903
Thanks.

18:56.065 --> 18:58.743
You made the big step.

18:58.745 --> 19:00.785
How do you feel about it?

19:02.105 --> 19:04.781
John and I are really happy.

19:04.783 --> 19:07.703
You know how I felt
about moving out here.

19:07.705 --> 19:11.103
But I think we made
the right decision.

19:11.105 --> 19:14.225
So, now everything
is okay with John?

19:15.065 --> 19:15.865
Oh.

19:16.903 --> 19:19.023
John's a sweetheart.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.103
We really love each other.

19:22.025 --> 19:24.265
And we're trying for a baby.

19:25.745 --> 19:26.545
Oh.

19:34.105 --> 19:36.423
We've known each other for ages.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.583
You know what I
think about John.

19:38.585 --> 19:41.663
He doesn't have a home
after what happened.

19:41.665 --> 19:42.623
Come on Kari.

19:42.625 --> 19:44.861
We only seriously argued once.

19:44.863 --> 19:46.143
Argued?

19:46.145 --> 19:47.343
He hit you Kate.

19:47.345 --> 19:49.945
It happened once,
four years ago.

19:52.543 --> 19:55.863
Katie, you're
like a sister to me.

19:55.865 --> 19:57.701
I only want the best for you.

19:57.703 --> 20:01.623
If you think this is
the best for you...

20:01.625 --> 20:04.823
Ladies, dessert
is ready.

20:04.825 --> 20:06.545
We'll be right out.

20:07.903 --> 20:11.023
Look, let's talk
about this later okay?

20:19.345 --> 20:20.981
Thanks guys.

20:20.983 --> 20:22.781
It was great to see you.

20:22.783 --> 20:25.061
It was a pleasure.

20:25.063 --> 20:26.943
Really Kareen,
you're always welcome.

20:26.945 --> 20:28.103
Thank you.

20:28.105 --> 20:29.663
And good luck for
everything Kate.

20:29.665 --> 20:32.381
Treat her well or
I'll hunt you down.

20:32.383 --> 20:33.903
I'm not gonna risk that

20:33.905 --> 20:35.345
so I guess I will.

20:36.823 --> 20:38.021
Kate, I will send
you the details

20:38.023 --> 20:39.543
of the gallery where I'm at.

20:39.545 --> 20:40.863
Oh great.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.183
Speak to you soon.

23:37.705 --> 23:38.861
You busy?

23:38.863 --> 23:39.984
Hey come in.

23:43.663 --> 23:46.063
Hey, check out these photos.

23:49.423 --> 23:51.581
What do you think?

23:51.583 --> 23:54.543
It's something on the lens.

23:54.545 --> 23:56.223
That's what I thought.

23:56.225 --> 23:58.901
So I used the same
camera and took

23:58.903 --> 24:01.704
some photos in the
garden and look.

24:05.143 --> 24:05.945
Nothing.

24:09.625 --> 24:10.825
I don't get it.

24:14.263 --> 24:15.504
I'm pregnant.

24:18.943 --> 24:19.745
What?

24:23.983 --> 24:25.145
I'm pregnant.

24:40.183 --> 24:41.583
John?

24:41.585 --> 24:43.025
John are you here?

24:48.545 --> 24:50.183
John are you down there?

24:55.265 --> 24:59.263
John could you come up and
help me with something?

25:02.743 --> 25:03.545
John?

25:11.425 --> 25:13.825
Ronnie Ronnie.

25:20.825 --> 25:21.743
John, could you
come and help me

25:21.745 --> 25:23.984
with something in the attic?

25:26.105 --> 25:27.865
I'll be right there.

25:29.105 --> 25:31.103
You wanna go inside, huh?

25:31.105 --> 25:31.863
Yeah, go go.

27:16.145 --> 27:18.783
Honey what's wrong?

27:18.785 --> 27:20.065
I had a dream.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.223
Another nightmare?

27:26.185 --> 27:27.025
I'm okay.

27:28.423 --> 27:30.024
Go on back to sleep.

27:32.945 --> 27:36.265
Are you sure you're
not having regrets?

27:37.505 --> 27:38.305
No.

27:46.303 --> 27:47.705
You and our child

27:48.823 --> 27:52.104
are the most beautiful
thing I could ask for.

29:58.945 --> 30:00.063
John!

30:05.545 --> 30:06.903
It was horrible.

30:06.905 --> 30:08.103
There was a little girl.

30:08.105 --> 30:10.863
She woke me up and
she ran in here.

30:10.865 --> 30:12.865
I didn't know what to do.

30:13.865 --> 30:16.025
You're okay, you're okay.

30:18.305 --> 30:19.703
Kate,

30:19.705 --> 30:21.944
you have a lot on your mind.

30:22.903 --> 30:24.341
This was just your imagination,

30:24.343 --> 30:25.944
there's nobody here.

30:27.305 --> 30:31.303
The only child in this
house will be ours.

30:31.783 --> 30:32.424
Okay?

30:37.945 --> 30:40.181
I need to print some negatives.

30:40.183 --> 30:42.144
Then I'll make us dinner.

30:46.423 --> 30:48.221
Oh tomorrow I need
to go to the city

30:48.223 --> 30:50.903
and get some film,
you need anything?

30:50.905 --> 30:54.143
Yes, I need you
to be more present.

30:54.145 --> 30:56.223
John you spend half
your time taking photos

30:56.225 --> 30:58.863
and the other half
locked in your dark room.

30:58.865 --> 31:00.543
I can't even remember
the last time

31:00.545 --> 31:02.345
we had a meal together.

31:03.665 --> 31:06.183
Kate, I'm working
on a project.

31:06.185 --> 31:08.381
I'm nearly finished.

31:08.383 --> 31:11.263
So why don't you
get some rest okay?

31:12.223 --> 31:13.505
I won't be long.

31:58.465 --> 32:00.865
Kate, perhaps you shouldn't.

32:01.985 --> 32:03.665
Yeah, you're right.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.623
Ugh, it's all so absurd.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.743
I'm so stressed out.

32:09.745 --> 32:11.463
I can't take anymore.

32:11.465 --> 32:14.021
In your state it's
natural to be stressed out.

32:14.023 --> 32:16.463
But John, what's wrong with him?

32:16.465 --> 32:19.421
I don't know, he's strange.

32:19.423 --> 32:21.821
He photographs things
I don't understand.

32:21.823 --> 32:23.103
100's of shots.

32:23.105 --> 32:24.423
And then he locks
himself away in his

32:24.425 --> 32:25.703
darkroom and won't let me in.

32:25.705 --> 32:27.545
Huh, what a surprise.

32:29.425 --> 32:32.783
Listen, don't get anxious
about it right now.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.301
Just think about giving birth

32:34.303 --> 32:37.503
and then you can try
to sort things out.

32:39.423 --> 32:40.621
Fuck.

32:40.623 --> 32:43.182
You made the wrong
choice Kate, sorry.

32:43.184 --> 32:44.341
What do you mean?

32:44.343 --> 32:46.703
By accepting his
apologies at the time.

32:46.705 --> 32:49.141
By agreeing to come here,
isolated from everybody

32:49.143 --> 32:50.701
and all your contacts.

32:50.703 --> 32:53.142
And yes, by getting
yourself pregnant

32:53.144 --> 32:54.745
by someone like him.

32:55.904 --> 32:57.743
Kareen are you
out of your mind?

32:57.745 --> 32:59.941
No Kate, I'm just
speaking from the heart.

32:59.943 --> 33:01.141
You called me for advice,

33:01.143 --> 33:03.863
or maybe just to get
things off your chest.

33:03.865 --> 33:06.102
And I find you
exactly how I feared

33:06.104 --> 33:07.424
I would find you.

33:09.303 --> 33:12.102
Please, as soon as
your son is born,

33:12.104 --> 33:14.183
get away from here.

33:14.185 --> 33:16.021
I can't believe
you'd say that.

33:16.023 --> 33:17.543
Come on.

33:17.545 --> 33:21.503
Kate, this child is the
last thing you needed.

33:21.505 --> 33:25.143
And I'm sure deep
down you know it too

33:25.145 --> 33:26.703
Look, it's getting late

33:26.705 --> 33:29.423
and I wouldn't want you
to get caught in traffic.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.184
Yeah okay, I got it.

33:37.145 --> 33:38.105
I'm leaving.

33:57.344 --> 33:58.145
Kate.

34:03.425 --> 34:04.225
Kate!

36:26.425 --> 36:29.022
What are you doing in here?

36:29.024 --> 36:31.863
I thought I heard something.

36:31.865 --> 36:33.983
More nightmares?

36:33.985 --> 36:36.745
Please John, do
you wanna get help?

36:37.544 --> 36:39.462
Maybe talk to someone?

36:39.464 --> 36:41.982
I think it would be
best for all of us.

36:41.984 --> 36:43.424
No, I'm alright.

36:44.425 --> 36:45.224
Really.

36:46.184 --> 36:48.344
Wait a minute, come here.

36:50.225 --> 36:53.183
Yeah, I don't
know what that is.

36:53.185 --> 36:54.863
I noticed it before.

36:54.865 --> 36:56.785
It's gotten worse honey.

36:58.184 --> 36:59.903
I don't like it, I think you
should get it checked out.

36:59.905 --> 37:01.902
It looks like an inflammation.

37:01.904 --> 37:03.503
I'll go to the
doctor tomorrow.

37:03.505 --> 37:04.304
I promise.

37:05.545 --> 37:07.265
Let's go back to bed.

38:07.385 --> 38:11.425
John could you come inside
and look at something?

38:13.865 --> 38:15.222
What happened?

38:15.224 --> 38:17.264
Come on, I'll show you.

38:29.825 --> 38:31.184
See for yourself.

38:43.465 --> 38:45.342
You must've fallen
asleep and had a bad dream.

38:45.344 --> 38:47.982
No, no these were different.

38:47.984 --> 38:49.424
I wasn't dreaming.

38:52.424 --> 38:55.263
Something's not right
with this house John.

38:55.265 --> 38:57.183
I can feel it.

38:57.185 --> 38:59.063
I can see it in you.

38:59.065 --> 39:00.704
Like I saw in Kareen.

39:01.825 --> 39:04.143
What are you really
trying to say huh?

39:04.145 --> 39:07.343
That we should leave our
home, go back to the city?

39:07.345 --> 39:11.345
You are not the first
woman to give birth.

39:11.905 --> 39:15.425
You're letting your spoiled
brat paranoia get to you.

39:16.225 --> 39:18.344
And I'm the one who needs help?

39:49.784 --> 39:52.943
A woman in your condition
shouldn't be smoking you know.

39:52.945 --> 39:56.063
To tell the truth, you
shouldn't smoke at all.

39:56.065 --> 39:57.702
Allow me to introduce myself.

39:57.704 --> 40:00.423
My name is Andrew Powell and
I'm the local parish priest.

40:00.425 --> 40:02.583
Oh, Kate Davis,
nice to meet you.

40:02.585 --> 40:04.943
So, how is it in the new home?

40:04.945 --> 40:06.383
How did you know?

40:06.385 --> 40:09.383
As soon as you moved
in rumors started flying.

40:09.385 --> 40:10.983
After the foreigners arrived.

40:10.985 --> 40:14.303
Living here is like living
in a huge aquarium Ms. Davis.

40:14.305 --> 40:15.663
Oh please, call me Kate.

40:15.665 --> 40:17.862
Kate, here everybody
knows everybody.

40:17.864 --> 40:20.823
And in your event even
the most irrelevant

40:20.825 --> 40:22.424
seems like an alien.

40:23.465 --> 40:25.062
Like an invasion.

40:25.064 --> 40:26.663
Like an invasion.

40:26.665 --> 40:28.103
But the truth of
the matter is always

40:28.105 --> 40:31.062
far more interesting than
the rumors they create.

40:31.064 --> 40:34.143
That old house had been
abandoned for far too long.

40:34.145 --> 40:36.503
Did you know the family
that used to live there?

40:36.505 --> 40:38.982
The Macknamara's, yes.

40:38.984 --> 40:40.983
William lived there
with his wife Shelley

40:40.985 --> 40:43.503
and their young daughter Maggie.

40:43.505 --> 40:46.703
Unfortunately a terrible
tragedy occurred in the house.

40:46.705 --> 40:49.743
But William had been
unwell for quite some time.

40:49.745 --> 40:50.943
What happened?

40:50.945 --> 40:52.943
What happened
is not important.

40:52.945 --> 40:56.022
But, as you can imagine,
it did shock the villages.

40:56.024 --> 40:58.263
They let themselves
get carried away with

40:58.265 --> 41:00.342
old legends and city charm.

41:00.344 --> 41:01.782
Oh, god, I'm sorry.

41:01.784 --> 41:02.943
I didn't realize the time.

41:02.945 --> 41:04.182
I've gotta go.

41:04.184 --> 41:06.342
Of course, it was a
pleasure to meet you.

41:06.344 --> 41:08.543
And I'm sure you know where
to find me if you need me.

41:08.545 --> 41:09.462
Thank you.

41:09.464 --> 41:12.102
And please, do stop smoking.

41:12.104 --> 41:13.823
At least for the
child you're carrying.

41:13.825 --> 41:14.624
I will.

41:32.305 --> 41:33.265
Good walk?

41:35.305 --> 41:37.544
The fresh air did me good.

41:38.384 --> 41:41.343
I met the local parish priest.

41:41.345 --> 41:44.823
He told me about the family
that used to live here.

41:44.825 --> 41:46.223
Apparently the
whole village thinks

41:46.225 --> 41:47.905
this house is cursed.

41:55.025 --> 41:58.062
So you're saying
that you met a priest

41:58.064 --> 42:00.865
and he told you
our home is cursed?

42:04.385 --> 42:05.825
We are not leaving.

42:07.945 --> 42:10.143
I know, I didn't mean that.

42:10.145 --> 42:13.345
I don't wanna leave,
we're staying here.

43:39.185 --> 43:40.503
John.

43:40.505 --> 43:41.305
John.

43:42.305 --> 43:43.345
John wake up!

45:36.785 --> 45:37.585
John.

45:38.864 --> 45:39.665
John.

47:39.145 --> 47:39.944
Ronnie!

47:40.904 --> 47:42.265
Ronnie, here boy!

47:43.625 --> 47:44.425
Ronnie?

48:21.104 --> 48:23.185
John have you seen Ronnie?

48:26.225 --> 48:27.185
No.

48:28.625 --> 48:29.783
Can you stop
taking damn photos

48:29.785 --> 48:32.305
for a minute and listen to me?!

48:33.464 --> 48:34.265
What?

48:35.665 --> 48:38.423
Oh Christ John, you said
you'd fill in that hole.

48:38.425 --> 48:42.183
This house is gonna be
infested by those creatures.

48:42.185 --> 48:44.945
And you're taking
pictures of them.

48:46.385 --> 48:49.225
John, I am really
worried about you.

48:52.145 --> 48:54.344
I'm working on a project.

48:56.585 --> 48:59.862
I found this
photograph in the attic.

48:59.864 --> 49:03.025
It's the family that
used to live here.

49:04.105 --> 49:07.103
What were you
doing in the attic?

49:07.105 --> 49:08.622
Nothing.

49:08.624 --> 49:10.784
John would you look at me?!

49:18.065 --> 49:19.745
I'm working.

49:33.464 --> 49:35.663
John, you have
to listen to me!

49:35.665 --> 49:37.503
There's something
strange in this house.

49:37.505 --> 49:38.742
That family...

49:38.744 --> 49:40.782
Who they were
and what they did

49:40.784 --> 49:42.942
is not my concern.

49:42.944 --> 49:44.545
And it's not yours either.

49:53.545 --> 49:54.344
John.

49:55.265 --> 49:56.862
Open this door!

49:57.665 --> 49:58.623
John!

49:58.625 --> 50:00.063
Open this door!

50:01.585 --> 50:02.783
John!

50:04.705 --> 50:06.224
Open this door now!

50:13.505 --> 50:16.182
So, why did
you want to see me?

50:16.184 --> 50:18.503
Have you finally
decided to tie the knot?

50:18.505 --> 50:20.262
Father, I need
to speak to you about

50:20.264 --> 50:22.223
the family that
lived in the house.

50:22.225 --> 50:25.503
Listen Kate, when I spoke
to you I didn't mean to...

50:25.505 --> 50:28.902
No no please, I've
gotta talk to you.

50:28.904 --> 50:30.185
It's about this.

50:32.105 --> 50:33.625
The Macknamara's.

50:34.745 --> 50:36.423
Their things are
still in the house?

50:36.425 --> 50:37.784
Father, please.

50:38.825 --> 50:40.422
Tell me what happened.

50:40.424 --> 50:42.505
I need to know everything.

50:44.384 --> 50:45.185
Kate,

50:46.385 --> 50:47.585
let's sit down.

50:58.025 --> 51:00.063
William didn't immediately
start showing signs

51:00.065 --> 51:01.265
of his illness.

51:02.065 --> 51:04.943
They seemed like a happy couple.

51:04.945 --> 51:07.223
But I was surprised
when after three months

51:07.225 --> 51:09.543
Shelley came to confession.

51:09.545 --> 51:11.783
She told me that
she was frightened,

51:11.785 --> 51:13.902
worried about her husband.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.745
Said that she didn't
recognize him.

51:17.905 --> 51:19.782
At the start I didn't
give it much thought.

51:19.784 --> 51:22.863
But then she kept
coming again and again.

51:22.865 --> 51:26.022
And each time she was
more and more worried.

51:26.024 --> 51:29.945
Until one day she came
with her daughter, Maggie.

51:31.064 --> 51:32.823
She asked me to look after her.

51:32.825 --> 51:36.863
She was convinced that
William wanted to harm her.

51:36.865 --> 51:39.783
I couldn't help
her so I refused.

51:39.785 --> 51:42.503
I told her to go
to the authorities.

51:42.505 --> 51:44.343
But she was convinced that her

51:44.345 --> 51:48.063
husbands problems were
not of an earthly nature.

51:48.065 --> 51:49.263
What do you mean?

51:49.265 --> 51:52.865
She was convinced her
husband was possessed.

51:53.984 --> 51:56.862
When she left I was
overwhelmed with guilt

51:56.864 --> 52:00.545
so I went to the house
to see if I could help.

52:02.024 --> 52:04.863
But when I arrived
it was too late.

52:04.865 --> 52:07.383
William had killed his
wife with a hammer.

52:07.385 --> 52:08.585
And hanged his daughter.

52:12.305 --> 52:15.983
Often faith can explode
in an uncontrolled way.

52:15.985 --> 52:19.943
Even those who are lowly
or have serious problems.

52:19.945 --> 52:22.782
The fine line between
suggestion and reality

52:22.784 --> 52:25.103
becomes increasingly blurred.

52:25.105 --> 52:26.823
So William was mad?

52:26.825 --> 52:28.263
Yes.

52:28.265 --> 52:30.783
He told me that his family
suffered from schizophrenia.

52:30.785 --> 52:33.263
Shelley couldn't handle it.

52:33.265 --> 52:36.183
It's a difficult enough
problem to deal with now.

52:36.185 --> 52:40.105
You can imagine what it
was like 20 years ago.

52:55.025 --> 52:58.062
Father, I think I've been
seeing things in the house.

52:58.064 --> 52:59.982
Connected to the family.

52:59.984 --> 53:02.384
And John, he's so strange now.

53:09.665 --> 53:10.983
He locks himself away all day.

53:10.985 --> 53:13.265
I don't know what he's doing.

53:14.144 --> 53:16.263
He's not himself.

53:16.265 --> 53:18.743
And he's so distant
and distracted.

53:25.225 --> 53:27.743
Kate, there is nothing

53:27.745 --> 53:30.263
linking the Macknamara's
to your family.

53:30.265 --> 53:33.702
What happened to them
was a terrible disgrace.

53:33.704 --> 53:35.903
You are going through
a difficult period.

53:35.905 --> 53:39.102
And the power of suggestion
is a terrible weapon.

53:39.104 --> 53:41.823
As a priest I can
assure you of this.

53:41.825 --> 53:44.103
Suggestion is an
open door that can

53:44.105 --> 53:45.584
lead to great evil.

53:46.424 --> 53:48.303
You are a rational person.

53:48.305 --> 53:50.543
There is no need for
you to take refuge

53:50.545 --> 53:53.382
in basically that which
is a convention for

53:53.384 --> 53:56.423
for the ignorant
or for the lonely.

53:56.425 --> 53:57.582
Father I...

53:57.584 --> 54:00.942
Kate, you are neither
ignorant nor alone.

54:00.944 --> 54:02.703
And you know this well.

54:02.705 --> 54:04.782
Hardly the words
of a parish priest.

54:04.784 --> 54:06.623
One must learn
to be objective.

54:06.625 --> 54:09.383
And to look at faith
in all of it's assets.

54:09.385 --> 54:12.942
For that which we tend to
define as good and evil.

54:12.944 --> 54:16.703
God and the devil is
merely a convention

54:16.705 --> 54:19.904
for something that
is much more complex.

54:45.305 --> 54:46.105
Kate.

54:50.465 --> 54:51.985
Kate are you there?

54:55.304 --> 54:58.345
Listen, I'm sorry
about the last time.

55:01.184 --> 55:01.985
Hello.

55:03.625 --> 55:05.024
Is anybody there?

55:23.264 --> 55:24.065
John?

55:26.945 --> 55:27.745
John.

56:49.265 --> 56:51.102
Do you realize
it's been two hours

56:51.104 --> 56:53.982
since you said you
wouldn't be long?

56:53.984 --> 56:55.825
Two fucking hours John.

57:02.585 --> 57:06.263
I finished working
and I had a shower.

57:06.265 --> 57:07.863
You had a shower.

57:07.865 --> 57:09.545
Needed to freshen up?

57:10.385 --> 57:12.425
I saw a cockroach earlier.

57:14.905 --> 57:16.664
I'll do it tomorrow.

57:19.865 --> 57:22.422
What'd you wanna talk about?

57:22.424 --> 57:25.385
I went to speak
with Father Powell.

57:27.824 --> 57:29.663
Christ Kate I told you...

57:29.665 --> 57:31.062
I know.

57:31.064 --> 57:33.102
Okay would you just
listen to me for a minute?

57:33.104 --> 57:35.703
He told me about the family
that used to live here.

57:35.705 --> 57:37.263
The things that
happened to them.

57:37.265 --> 57:39.743
John there was a massacre here.

57:39.745 --> 57:40.544
No Kate.

57:41.384 --> 57:43.263
You listen to me.

57:43.265 --> 57:47.103
You're letting yourself
be influenced by bullshit.

57:47.105 --> 57:50.382
They are rumors
created by villagers.

57:50.384 --> 57:51.822
Wake up.

57:51.824 --> 57:54.222
Are you listening
to what you're saying?

57:54.224 --> 57:56.543
Something's not right here!

57:56.545 --> 57:58.782
Don't you understand?

57:58.784 --> 58:00.385
I am done talking.

58:02.185 --> 58:03.143
Right.

58:03.145 --> 58:04.745
You're done talking.

58:05.624 --> 58:07.463
That's what you do best.

58:07.465 --> 58:09.303
Avoiding any discussion,

58:09.305 --> 58:12.344
any difficulties,
any goddam problems!

58:13.465 --> 58:16.743
Fine, if that's the
way you want it,

58:16.745 --> 58:20.065
I won't be bringing
up my child with you.

58:30.224 --> 58:31.025
Kate.

58:33.625 --> 58:34.422
I'm sorry.

58:34.424 --> 58:35.785
Don't touch me.

58:40.985 --> 58:42.344
I'm sorry Kate.

58:45.704 --> 58:46.983
I'm sorry.

58:48.425 --> 58:50.465
What's happening to us?

58:54.385 --> 58:56.423
I'm sorry.

01:02:28.585 --> 01:02:29.384
John?

01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:32.665
What are you doing down here?

01:02:33.944 --> 01:02:35.185
I was just...

01:02:37.945 --> 01:02:41.022
John we have to
get away from here.

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:44.504
I can't spend another
minute in this house!

01:02:45.464 --> 01:02:46.265
John!

01:02:49.105 --> 01:02:51.865
I have told you
a thousand times,

01:02:53.504 --> 01:02:54.305
no.

01:02:56.024 --> 01:02:59.465
John, I am really
starting to get scared.

01:03:02.105 --> 01:03:05.624
I have no intention
of leaving this house.

01:03:07.385 --> 01:03:09.145
Our child will be born

01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:11.545
as I planned.

01:03:13.505 --> 01:03:14.305
Ronnie.

01:03:15.745 --> 01:03:17.024
What did you do?

01:03:19.904 --> 01:03:21.102
Perhaps somebody killed him

01:03:21.104 --> 01:03:24.222
because he wouldn't
stop barking.

01:03:24.224 --> 01:03:25.025
Oh god.

01:03:27.425 --> 01:03:29.022
Listen to me!

01:03:29.024 --> 01:03:30.425
We have to leave!

01:05:08.345 --> 01:05:09.145
Kate.

01:05:11.705 --> 01:05:12.505
Help me.

01:05:15.224 --> 01:05:16.505
John I'm here.

01:05:37.304 --> 01:05:38.103
That's it.

01:06:38.304 --> 01:06:39.103
What?

01:06:40.743 --> 01:06:42.663
This doesn't make sense!

01:07:02.225 --> 01:07:03.384
Take me home.

01:07:20.064 --> 01:07:20.863
No.

01:07:21.824 --> 01:07:22.625
Fuck!

01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:26.623
Kate.

01:07:32.345 --> 01:07:34.503
That's it.

01:07:34.505 --> 01:07:35.304
Come on.

01:07:39.384 --> 01:07:40.263
No!

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:41.662
John!

01:07:41.664 --> 01:07:42.463
John!

01:07:45.305 --> 01:07:47.225
John. John.

01:07:48.824 --> 01:07:49.784
John.

01:10:34.145 --> 01:10:34.944
John?

01:10:37.424 --> 01:10:38.823
John.

01:10:38.825 --> 01:10:40.822
What are you doing?

01:10:40.824 --> 01:10:44.022
John, stay back.

01:10:44.024 --> 01:10:44.825
John.

01:10:48.065 --> 01:10:48.864
John.

01:14:10.664 --> 01:14:11.465
Kitty.

01:15:54.824 --> 01:15:56.105
What happened?

01:15:57.944 --> 01:15:58.825
Where am I?

01:16:03.185 --> 01:16:04.865
Who are these people?

01:16:11.705 --> 01:16:12.464
My son.

01:16:13.784 --> 01:16:14.984
Where's my son?

01:16:20.744 --> 01:16:21.545
Jackson?

01:16:22.664 --> 01:16:23.465
My baby!

01:16:24.305 --> 01:16:25.104
Jackson.

01:16:30.944 --> 01:16:31.904
Who are you?

01:16:33.944 --> 01:16:37.784
Kate, your child
is not John's son.

01:16:39.905 --> 01:16:42.102
What are you talking about?

01:16:42.104 --> 01:16:44.542
Ms. Davis, we
are an organization

01:16:44.544 --> 01:16:46.822
which is much older
and much larger

01:16:46.824 --> 01:16:49.383
than you could possibly imagine.

01:16:49.385 --> 01:16:52.263
But myself, those gathered here,

01:16:52.265 --> 01:16:54.303
and ironically you,

01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:57.342
we are just tiny
elements of a much

01:16:57.344 --> 01:17:00.785
greater reality which
we can only perceive.

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:04.942
About a year before
the unfortunate

01:17:04.944 --> 01:17:08.742
Macknamara family moved
into this abandoned house,

01:17:08.744 --> 01:17:11.305
we gathered here to contact him.

01:17:22.824 --> 01:17:24.502
I understood that
William was not the

01:17:24.504 --> 01:17:26.742
father of their future child.

01:17:26.744 --> 01:17:29.343
And when I realized what
had actually happened,

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:32.225
Shelley had to, but
it was too late.

01:17:43.304 --> 01:17:45.423
We thought it had ended there,

01:17:45.425 --> 01:17:47.902
but a few years later
after the Macknamara's

01:17:47.904 --> 01:17:51.382
had moved in I was
able to understand

01:17:51.384 --> 01:17:53.182
thanks to their confessions,

01:17:53.184 --> 01:17:55.302
that what was happening to them

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:58.345
was due to what we
had performed here.

01:17:59.705 --> 01:18:02.825
And it has happened
again Kate, to you.

01:18:04.385 --> 01:18:06.702
Your child is the
fruit of his seed.

01:18:06.704 --> 01:18:09.183
The end of an
evercation in which you

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:12.183
unknowingly were the main pawn.

01:18:12.185 --> 01:18:13.743
This child was
born in the temple

01:18:13.745 --> 01:18:15.582
where he was evoked.

01:18:15.584 --> 01:18:18.582
And his destiny unfortunately

01:18:18.584 --> 01:18:22.585
is something that your decisions
can no longer influence.

01:18:23.225 --> 01:18:24.822
You're crazy.

01:18:24.824 --> 01:18:26.622
You're crazy!

01:18:26.624 --> 01:18:27.745
I want my son!

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:32.182
Where are you taking him?

01:18:32.184 --> 01:18:34.222
Where are you taking him?!

01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:35.023
Oh god!

01:18:38.024 --> 01:18:39.462
Where is he going?

01:18:39.464 --> 01:18:42.382
Ms. Davis, if this
unfortunate occasion

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.662
is the last time
you see your son,

01:18:44.664 --> 01:18:48.063
it will be because
you have decided so.

01:18:48.065 --> 01:18:49.863
But you conceived him.

01:18:49.865 --> 01:18:52.383
We can offer you the
chance to join us

01:18:52.385 --> 01:18:53.424
to raise him.

01:18:54.545 --> 01:18:56.982
In time, you will
learn to understand

01:18:56.984 --> 01:19:00.183
how important your
child really is.

01:19:00.185 --> 01:19:03.303
Otherwise for you,
it will be as if

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:04.704
he never existed.

01:19:05.664 --> 01:19:07.063
As Shelley's mom.

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:10.944
No, no.

01:19:12.144 --> 01:19:13.342
No!

01:19:13.344 --> 01:19:14.943
Jackson!

01:19:14.945 --> 01:19:15.744
No!

01:19:16.625 --> 01:19:17.664
Give me back!

01:19:18.785 --> 01:19:20.624
Give me my baby please!

01:19:21.665 --> 01:19:22.464
No!

01:19:23.304 --> 01:19:24.103
No!

01:19:54.982 --> 01:19:58.822
