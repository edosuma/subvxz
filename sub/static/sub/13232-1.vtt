04:02.720 --> 04:03.881
What are you doing?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.440
- Where'd I come from?
- Let me down.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.006
- Who knows? Where you been?
- Let me down.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.851
- Please don't take my top off.
- I won't.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.485
- Please, don't.
- I promise. I won't.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.481
I got it.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.330
You're such a pew.

04:23.440 --> 04:24.441
You want it?

04:24.560 --> 04:25.641
- Thanks.
- All right. Here.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.405
This is not a nude beach.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.522
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.920
You're so going to go get that.
Go get it.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.771
No, I'm gonna get something to eat.
But I'll be back.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.565
You're so bad.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.649
(GRuNTING>

06:11.240 --> 06:12.651
That's a frag.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.965
Here we go. Come on.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.966
Kaboom!

06:17.080 --> 06:19.526
Hey, douchey, why weren't you
at the loading bay?

06:19.640 --> 06:21.847
- Are you kidding me?
- No, you were supposed to be flanking.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.645
Just shut up. Respawn
and meet me at the dock.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.725
Ooh. Hey everyone, Wonsuk is PMSing
on the battlefield again. This is fun.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.047
Gordon, do you think you could maybe just
out it out for a second here?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.964
- I'm trying to...
- Is that friendly fire?

06:35.160 --> 06:37.288
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you
from the enemy.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.004
OK, seriously, you're killing me here.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.408
Can you just come over and help me here?
These guys are getting pwned

06:42.520 --> 06:45.520
Right, playing XBOX that's what's going
to pop on my med school application.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.604
Just put the books down
and relax for a second.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.046
I can't relax Gordon, all right,

06:50.160 --> 06:52.481
'cause not all of us
are on the 7-year graduation program.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.122
Not hearing you, because I just logged
you in and you're losing gamer points.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.641
Dude, it took me six months
to get those points.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.921
Yes, it did, get involved.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.530
Hey, boys, you shit the bed.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.603
I got a new partner
who actually knows how to flank.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.210
So long, boys.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.081
Nick!

07:08.480 --> 07:09.481
Malik?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.001
What...

07:12.160 --> 07:13.207
What's going on, man?

07:13.320 --> 07:15.320
I'm going to beat your bony ass
is what's going on.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.283
- Shit.
- The athletic department said

07:17.400 --> 07:19.050
you were the best tutor on campus?

07:19.760 --> 07:21.967
Man, you knew I needed a "C"
to keep my scholarship.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.490
And without my ride, I'm ghost.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.366
No degree
and I'm back living in the 4-1-O.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.845
And I told you about the 4-1-0.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.203
- He did tell you about the 4-1-O.
- OK, thanks, Gordon.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.881
Yeah, come here, Nick.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.131
I don't want to come there.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.610
I said come here, Nick.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.290
B-plus, baby.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.567
- What?
- Yeah, come on, Nick.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.570
- Oh, man! You, you...
- And now I'm going to pay you back.

08:01.680 --> 08:05.287
We are going up to Lake Crosby
to celebrate.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.126
Oh, no, I've got, Malik, I, I can't...

08:09.240 --> 08:12.767
I mean, I got my MCAT coming up,
a chem final on Monday, I can't...

08:12.880 --> 08:14.689
Shh, Shh, Shh.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.211
Feel me on this.

08:17.320 --> 08:21.405
We are going to Sara Palski's house.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.804
Sara Palski.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.449
'Sup, baby girl, you ready for the lake?

08:59.640 --> 09:03.361
- Yeah, I can't talk right now, Maya.
- What's his name?

09:03.520 --> 09:05.522
I don't know. I didn't even ask.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.287
I'll be ready in 30 minutes, more like 15
if he knows what he's doing.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.210
You are so bad.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.081
Do me.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.411
- Yo, Nick. Check this out.
- What?

09:45.560 --> 09:46.607
Wow!

09:46.720 --> 09:48.760
Yeah, I'm thinking about doing
it this weekend, man.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.922
Grab some wine, build a little fire,
drop a knee, and...

09:53.400 --> 09:56.961
- look her down for good, man.
- Are you snorting steroids?

09:57.440 --> 09:59.204
- We don't need to bring him, by the way.
- I'm just saying...

09:59.320 --> 10:01.322
You're a projected
top ten draft pick.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.330
You know? That means,
it's like a guaranteed four mil.

10:04.440 --> 10:08.809
You know, that's hot tubs and strip joints,
and groupies after every game.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.361
Why you want to handcuff yourself
to like, one piece of ass?

10:11.520 --> 10:14.091
- I've got no love for the hos, all right?
- Well, I do.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.044
I have a lot of love for said hos,
and I'm gonna need you for that.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.446
He does. He does.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.882
Look, man, Maya was with me
when I was poor, all right?

10:21.040 --> 10:23.361
Now she deserves me
when I'm ballin'.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.926
All right. You're a disgrace
to the modern athlete.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.360
Blake, what up?

10:28.840 --> 10:31.207
What's up, bitches?

10:33.080 --> 10:35.003
'Sup big guy?

10:35.120 --> 10:37.930
Hey, I know you.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.648
Yeah, Intro to Human Portrait
last semester.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.088
I had the pleasure of sketching your
genitals every Tuesday and Thursday.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.248
Nice. You're welcome.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.164
Hey, boys.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.851
You kids want some candy?
All you got to do is get inside.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.128
- Totally.
- Yep. Yep.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.281
Hey, baby.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.930
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.246
- Sara.
- Room for one more?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.084
Yeah, totally.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.890
- Threesome.
- Shut up.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.161
If you just wanna...

11:09.280 --> 11:11.521
- Right there's probably no problem.
- Cool.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.247
Good boy. You guys have fun back there.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.449
Not quite what we
had in mind there, but...

12:27.520 --> 12:29.727
Nothing like the smell
of fish in the morning.

12:29.840 --> 12:30.841
Finally.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.570
- I gotta pee.
- Oh, yo, look at this lake.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.966
- Who is that?
- Good morning, ladies.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.923
- All right.
- Almost as pretty as you, girl.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.803
Just so you guys know, your cell phones
are not gonna work out here, so...

12:39.920 --> 12:41.490
- make your calls now.
- OK.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.968
- Oh, God.
- Gross.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.008
- OK, thought of the day.
- OK.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.407
Nick is definitely hot.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.364
What, I am just saying that

13:00.840 --> 13:04.208
it might be kind of fun
to slaughter his innocence this weekend.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.405
Beth. Just be gentle with that one.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.726
- Maybe start with a...
- Sara.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.201
Beth. Can you start
with the rubber handcuffs, OK?

13:12.360 --> 13:14.328
I mean, jeez.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.845
What happened to you
hooking up with Blake?

13:15.960 --> 13:19.487
Oh, gross. I told you
he spray tans his junk, right?

13:19.600 --> 13:22.331
Last time, I had these stains,
like, all over my...

13:22.440 --> 13:24.249
OK. I don't need a play-by-play.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.561
Thank you, Beth.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.247
So you're probably going to have
to get her drunk, right?

13:29.360 --> 13:32.284
I mean, she's not gonna let you
tickle her privates sober.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.721
Actually, not trying to tickle
anyone's privates.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.162
Yeah, but if you're gonna be a doctor,
you should probably see a woman naked.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.566
Seen plenty of women naked.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.200
- Cadavers don't count, so...
- OK.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.207
What are you gonna do?

13:43.320 --> 13:46.927
You gonna make her one of your
awesome mix-tapes? Those are amazing.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.769
Don't disrespect the mix-tape, OK?

13:48.880 --> 13:50.769
- First of all, your mom loves them.
- That's cute.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.326
And, two, I'm not sure
if there's really a connection, even.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.568
OK, I see what's going on here.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.126
You're trying to play it cool
and stand back, right?

13:58.240 --> 14:01.961
'Cause you're too much of a puss
to step up your game, so meanwhile,

14:02.080 --> 14:05.004
somebody else is just going
to swoop in and grab that little rabbit.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.283
And I get the pleasure of listening to
your vagina cry itself to sleep at night.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.284
It's fun for me all around.
Here, you know what?

14:11.400 --> 14:14.927
Grab that and practice making some
babies. It's going to be fun.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.005
All right.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.809
Hey, what's up, man?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.448
I mean, I know you're scared,

14:40.560 --> 14:42.130
because, you know,
you're hung like a toddler,

14:42.280 --> 14:43.884
- but you'll work it out.
- That's not funny.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.604
That's a sensitive issue there.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.363
What you watching there, guy?

14:54.640 --> 14:55.880
Wow.

14:59.800 --> 15:04.249
OK, you just officially creeped me out,
so he's buying.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.685
Just these items.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.322
That's awful sweet of you.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.171
What's that?

15:18.320 --> 15:20.687
Letting the help sit up front like that.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.449
What the hell did you just say?

15:30.720 --> 15:34.327
I could give you English lessons
in the back of my truck if you like.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.967
What? What? Say it again.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.170
Give me an English lesson.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.281
Hey.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.491
What's your problem, boy?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.201
What'?!

15:46.880 --> 15:48.609
Who you calling boy?

15:49.520 --> 15:51.204
It's about to get gritty right here.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.964
Malik, let's just go.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.327
Try not to mess up my face.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.364
Dennis?

16:07.560 --> 16:10.040
- Sara?
- What's going on here?

16:10.800 --> 16:13.770
It's just a misunderstanding, that's all.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.283
Red's had a few too many today.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.284
My name's Red.
I'm an alcoholic.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.411
Sara Palski.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.722
Wow, look at you.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.210
How's college life?

16:31.800 --> 16:32.801
One more year.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.647
What are you, like,
an English major now, or something?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.684
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess...

16:44.760 --> 16:46.046
. . psychology.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.286
Well, I got to go.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.805
It was really good seeing you, Dennis.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.926
You too, Sara.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.484
Sweet crew, Sara.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.560
Hey, seriously, Sara, I was this close
to putting my foot up Scarf ace's ass.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.040
I'm sorry. They're harmless.
They're just locals.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.608
It's all ready for you, Sara.
You guys have fun on the island.

17:33.880 --> 17:34.881
Awesome.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.480
Fancy.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.480
Watch out, cooler coming,
cooler coming.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.484
Most important pan of the trip.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.483
Y'all have fun on the island.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.324
I'm on a boat.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.891
You want to drive the boat?

18:14.800 --> 18:17.007
- Really?
- Yeah, it's insured.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.887
Oh. OK, sure.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.370
No, you're not ready.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.087
Good one. That's funny.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.125
Is it always this hot here?

19:05.720 --> 19:08.929
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm hot. And you're hot.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.924
Like... sweatiness.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.402
- I look sweaty?
- Hot. I mean, I'm not, I'm not...

19:28.280 --> 19:30.408
Whoo!

19:35.040 --> 19:36.201
Geronimo!

19:40.040 --> 19:41.246
Sara, what are you doing?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.724
- Sara! Sara, stop!
- Sara!

19:56.880 --> 19:58.962
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.927
- Oh, shit.
- Nick.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.646
Sara, I think, maybe we should just
maybe stop for a second.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.249
OK, OK.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.284
- Slow down!
- He's right behind us.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.083
Well, well, well, little missy.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.129
You should consider yourself...

21:06.440 --> 21:07.851
still undefeated.

21:09.680 --> 21:10.886
Hey, Sar-bear.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.081
Hey, Sheriff Sabin.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.521
I almost didn't recognize you
with the 'stache.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.045
Yeah, it gives me authority, huh?

21:16.920 --> 21:19.127
I got to convince your daddy
to buy me one of these buckets

21:19.240 --> 21:20.605
to even things up.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.883
So, are these some of your...
Bible class buddies?

21:24.040 --> 21:26.361
Yeah, something like that.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.842
How's the crime fighting business going?

21:28.960 --> 21:31.884
Same old, same old
CSI Lake Crosby, you know.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.321
Excessive noise complaints,
salinity measurements,

21:34.440 --> 21:37.330
fishing hooks caught in toes,
ugly stuff.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.890
So, you animals have fun.
Oh, but first, hey,

21:41.040 --> 21:43.520
Tarzan, why don't you toss me
one of them cold ones you got in there?

21:43.720 --> 21:46.041
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.843
- Take two, Sheriff.
- Thank you.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.564
Hey, is this how you college kids do it?

21:56.120 --> 21:58.043
- There we go. All right.
- Nice.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.282
- Nice.
- Sheriffs still got it.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.680
I'm going to be dropping by tomorrow.
I told your mama I'd drop the mail off, OK?

22:05.960 --> 22:09.726
Good to see you back again, Sara.
It's been three years too long.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.571
- Thanks, Sheriff.
- Nice meeting you all.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.887
- All right. Sheriff.
- Take care. Be safe.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.489
- We're here, guys.
- OK.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.242
Whoo!

23:06.720 --> 23:09.690
Hey, boys.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.291
It's going to be a good weekend.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.445
So, Dr. Creeper,
you want to finish eye-humping Sara

23:32.560 --> 23:36.645
- after we do this thing or what?
- Yeah, no, yeah, sorry, sorry.

23:36.760 --> 23:41.288
But hey, what's her story, anyway?
Is she...

23:42.360 --> 23:44.806
She like hanging out with anybody?

23:44.920 --> 23:48.163
No, man, it's kind of weird. I mean,
we've known her for about three years,

23:48.360 --> 23:51.523
and never seen her go out on a date.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.364
Not even hook up at a party.

23:54.160 --> 23:59.041
She's just always hanging out
with Sherman, the dog.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.289
Come on, come on, come on, go fetch it.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.727
Come on, boy, bring it back.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.886
Good boy, good boy. Come here.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.926
Come here, good boy, good boy, good boy.
Come on, come on, come on.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.889
- Come on, baby.
- The elbow, and the release.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.207
- Oh, it was off.
- Another miss.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.290
- Never going to get this. And yet again.
- Oh, come on.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.765
- You're hopeless. Ready?
- Yeah, I am.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.922
- Honestly, at this point, I'm hopeless.
- You ready for this?

24:57.040 --> 24:58.804
- Yep. Yeah.
- You sure?

25:02.160 --> 25:06.131
Oh, my God. Check out Tan-zilla.

25:07.480 --> 25:10.086
Oh, wait, wait, wait for it,
wait, here it comes.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.447
- No, no, he's not going to.
- Yeah.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.681
That's classy.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.768
When are you going to drop the
boy toy and saddle up with a real man?

25:19.880 --> 25:22.326
- Really, you got someone in mind?
- Yeah.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.329
I could show you my erotic secrets

25:24.440 --> 25:27.364
right on this inflatable
beer pong mattress here, huh?

25:27.800 --> 25:29.404
I can make some waves right here.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.648
Looks pretty sturdy. Let's rock it out.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.962
Let's shock the Western World together.

25:35.080 --> 25:38.721
- Oh! Snap.
- Who is the champion of the world?

25:39.400 --> 25:40.401
Be careful, Malik.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.329
Come on, you're talking
to Superman, girl.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.921
Crank it up, Nick. Oh, yeah.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.811
Do a trick for me!

25:51.640 --> 25:54.405
Ha, ha, ha! Yeah, baby!

25:54.520 --> 25:55.806
Get them, Malik!

25:59.560 --> 26:00.560
Shit!

26:00.600 --> 26:03.171
- One hand, baby, what's good.
- Did you see that?

26:07.280 --> 26:08.645
Good job, man!

26:08.800 --> 26:11.849
- Hey, let's take him down over there.
- Yeah, OK.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.247
Whoo!

26:39.200 --> 26:40.326
Hey, let's turn around.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.488
- Turning around!
- Let's turn around!

26:42.600 --> 26:45.490
Turning around!

27:19.880 --> 27:21.245
That's my man!

27:22.240 --> 27:23.241
Yeah!

27:29.080 --> 27:30.286
Yeah!

27:36.040 --> 27:37.371
Oh!

27:39.480 --> 27:40.480
Ahh!

27:42.000 --> 27:43.525
Oh, my God!

27:43.680 --> 27:44.841
Kid's about to eat it!

27:46.080 --> 27:47.411
Go faster, man, go!

27:47.600 --> 27:50.683
- Faster, baby!
- Go faster, Nick, speed up. Speed up!

27:50.800 --> 27:53.451
- Oh, Oh, Oh!
- MAYA Whoa!

27:57.920 --> 27:59.285
Oh, Shit!

28:00.160 --> 28:02.925
- Yo, Nick! Nick, he's down!
- Turn around, Nick.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.842
- What happened?
- He fell.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.689
Good surfing, 'Lika

28:13.640 --> 28:15.642
- See him?
- Malik!

28:16.640 --> 28:18.881
- Malik!
- Anywhere?

28:21.720 --> 28:22.960
Malik!

28:26.520 --> 28:28.124
(THuDDING>

28:31.200 --> 28:33.441
- Malik!
- Yo, where the hell is he?

28:34.680 --> 28:36.762
Malik, come on, stop playing!

28:39.920 --> 28:41.126
There he is.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.046
Sara.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.411
Sara.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.329
Beth, Gordon, help!

29:11.160 --> 29:12.525
Hey, what the hell happened?!

29:13.640 --> 29:14.880
(PANTING>

29:16.760 --> 29:18.569
Get him up, get him up, get him up!

29:22.520 --> 29:25.524
Put him down right here.
All right, put him down slowly, slowly.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.011
- I'll get the phone.
- Gordon, Gordon, call for help!

29:29.160 --> 29:31.367
- No, there's no reception out here.
- Just try anyway.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.409
We gotta stop the bleeding.
We need a first aid kit.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.960
- Sara, do you have a first aid kit?
- Yes, it's in the house.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.286
Quick, go get it.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.210
- Shit, I'm not getting anything.
- Just keep trying.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.802
- You bastard!
- What did you do?

29:55.920 --> 29:58.082
- You ran over his arm.
- What? No. He fell.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.845
He fell, right? You guys saw him.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.406
I saw him fall, I didn't see
his goddamn arm get ripped off!

30:03.560 --> 30:05.130
- All right, calm down.
- Sit down, you little bitch!

30:05.280 --> 30:06.850
- Come on, asshole!
- Stop! It doesn't matter!

30:06.960 --> 30:08.160
Somebody do something, please.

30:08.280 --> 30:11.682
I was just driving around and he fell,
you saw him. I just drove.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.167
Nick. You're the only one
who knows what to do.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.886
Malik! Malik, can you hear me?

30:23.400 --> 30:26.961
Gordon, I need you to go and get a stick,
or like a branch, or something,

30:27.080 --> 30:29.560
- about a foot long and an inch thick, OK?
- OK.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.806
Be careful.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.210
Malik? Malik, can you hear me, man?

30:37.320 --> 30:39.163
- Can you hear me?
- Here.

30:40.480 --> 30:41.606
Be careful.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.326
Constant pressure, OK,
keep that pressure on.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.201
Maya, I need you to lift his head up,
all right? Keep it elevated, OK?

30:51.240 --> 30:53.402
- It's going to be OK.
- Gordon, give me your phone.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.010
I need the time, need the time.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.123
OK, OK, OK.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.088
Wait, wait, where the hell are you going?!

32:31.960 --> 32:34.167
Nick, Nick, hurry!

32:34.400 --> 32:36.289
Nick! Nick!

32:37.840 --> 32:38.966
Come on!

32:48.120 --> 32:49.565
Holy shit.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.404
- Slowly, slowly.
- It's OK, it's OK.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.401
A shark, man? This is insane.
This is a lake.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.760
- It's a saltwater lake.
- What the hell does that mean?

32:59.800 --> 33:02.280
- It means it's not impossible.
- Think they can save it?

33:02.400 --> 33:04.562
If we find an orthopedic surgeon
in the middle of the bayou.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.802
- How much time do we have?
- About two hours.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.088
- How far is the nearest hospital?
- About two hours.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.242
All right, I need everyone
off the boat, OK?

33:11.400 --> 33:12.845
Sara's gonna drive
and I'm gonna keep Malik stable.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.400
- Everyone else will just slow us down.
- I'm not leaving him.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.728
- Can you guys push us off?
- Put pressure here.

33:17.840 --> 33:20.360
Yeah, we'll send someone back
as soon as we can, just hang tight

33:20.440 --> 33:23.250
and whatever you do,
stay out of the water.

33:36.320 --> 33:39.244
It's going to be OK, Malik.
You're OK.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.204
Don't worry, we're going to save your arm.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.561
Nick.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.600
Maya!

34:00.200 --> 34:01.611
Sara, stop the boat!

34:02.400 --> 34:04.880
Help! Help!

34:10.199 --> 34:11.804
Come on, Maya, swim!

34:13.600 --> 34:15.762
Hang on! Go, Sara, go, go.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.607
Hang on, Maya! Faster, Sara!

34:33.719 --> 34:34.721
Hang on!

34:41.400 --> 34:42.764
Sara, faster!

34:51.960 --> 34:53.007
Maya!

34:55.920 --> 34:57.126
Maya!

35:03.240 --> 35:05.368
Nick! Nick!

35:06.920 --> 35:07.920
What is it?

35:08.040 --> 35:10.691
- What happened?
- The steering is gone!

35:10.800 --> 35:12.165
We've got to slow down!

35:12.280 --> 35:13.566
The throttle is jammed.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.041
I can't stop it!

35:17.200 --> 35:19.160
All right, we've got to bail, OK?
Grab the cooler.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.048
Come on, buddy.
Come on, we got to go.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.805
- Ready?
- Yeah!

35:26.800 --> 35:28.325
Now!

35:50.400 --> 35:52.402
- Oh, my God.
- Move, move, move.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.403
- Oh, my God.
- Easy, easy, easy.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.362
Shit, we got to get someone out here.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.129
I saw a flare in the boathouse.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.402
- Maya's dead. Maya's dead.
- Beth, don't say that.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.561
Don't say that!

36:04.720 --> 36:06.609
- He doesn't need to hear that.
- Calm down.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.768
You need to calm down.
Get me out of here.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.649
Beth, you're not
helping anything right now.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.331
- Right now, we all need to stay calm.
- This is a nightmare.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.606
Beth, listen to me, OK?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.647
I know that you're scared, OK?
We're all scared.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.411
This is your fault.
You brought us here.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.885
This is your fault!

36:22.000 --> 36:24.890
Hey, hey, look, guys, just relax.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.126
I'm sorry.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.121
How's Beth?

36:58.640 --> 37:01.120
Threatening to press charges
before the Xanax kicked in.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.007
Oh, hold on.

37:12.800 --> 37:13.801
Thanks.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.843
You stay here. Watch him.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.841
Hey!

37:40.840 --> 37:42.968
Hey, Blake, who is it?

37:47.840 --> 37:48.841
Oh.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.246
Well, well, well.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.686
- Hello, boys.
- It's the guys from the bait shop.

37:54.840 --> 37:58.731
That is right, skinny pole.
The guy from the bait shop.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.685
Listen, there's been an accident,
we need your help.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.480
Well, what's the matter?
Somebody get hurt playing spin the bottle?

38:06.880 --> 38:10.123
Well, I sure do hope
it wasn't my mamacita.

38:10.640 --> 38:14.201
You see, we've got some vacuuming
that needs done on our yacht...

38:14.360 --> 38:16.203
Shut your damn mouth,
you son of a bitch!

38:16.320 --> 38:18.721
- Put the gun down.
- Easy, Blake. They don't know.

38:19.560 --> 38:22.404
Yeah, Blake, we don't know.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.049
Whoa, whoa, whoa now.

38:28.880 --> 38:29.881
Red.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.044
BLam!

38:38.120 --> 38:41.442
Yeah, college boy,
what don't we know?

38:41.920 --> 38:45.561
Her name was Maya
and she's dead.

38:53.360 --> 38:56.682
Jesus, love, and Mary,
your boy got jacked.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.929
We got to get you all back to shore
and down to Manchac's ER.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.367
- All right, come on.
- No, Manchac's a dump.

39:02.520 --> 39:04.204
They can't handle this kind of trauma.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.283
He's going to sit,
waiting to get transferred

39:06.440 --> 39:08.408
or else they're going to
butcher him even worse.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.763
- We got to get him to St. Francis.
- No, no, we can't move him.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.526
He's lost too much blood already, OK?
I have to keep him stable.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.880
All right, all right.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.403
We'll head to the marina. As soon as we
grab a signal, we'll radio the Medevac.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.602
They'll chopper out a surgeon
within the hour.

39:23.680 --> 39:26.445
- Who's coming?
- Take me.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.131
- Hey, no, Beth.
- No, no, no.

39:28.280 --> 39:31.727
I'm not staying here any longer.
Let me get my stuff.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.840
Hey, look, are you sure about this, man?

39:44.960 --> 39:46.928
Yeah, OK? Beth is a mess right now.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.041
Yeah, Gordon, you can't.

39:48.160 --> 39:52.643
I'm not going to let her go on that boat
alone with swamp thing here. I'm going.

39:52.760 --> 39:56.446
- Hey, you saw what it did to our boat.
- Don't fret there, cupcake.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.482
Ain't nothing to worry about...

40:00.440 --> 40:01.726
not with this thing.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.325
You see, this here...

40:05.480 --> 40:08.484
will paralyze anything
that swims within 100 yards

40:08.600 --> 40:10.329
of this here fine vessel.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.521
We shouldn't see a fin.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.611
Even if we do.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.764
We always got this.

40:22.200 --> 40:26.046
All right, boy. No time to dilly-dally.
Let's get a move on.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.446
Thanks, Dennis.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.366
I owe you.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.450
No. We're good, Sara.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.411
How you feeling, big dog?

40:47.680 --> 40:49.284
Like a one-armed linebacker.

40:50.560 --> 40:53.530
Yeah. We got a doctor
coming down here.

40:53.640 --> 40:56.211
He's going to Humpty Dumpty your ass
back together, OK?

40:57.920 --> 40:59.046
So...

40:59.760 --> 41:00.886
if...

41:02.520 --> 41:03.851
I don't make it...

41:05.640 --> 41:07.563
I gotta know
what she was gonna say.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.207
If she'd still marry half a man.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.890
Well, let's just worry about getting you
back together and right, OK?

41:21.720 --> 41:25.770
Yeah. Hey, where's she at?

41:28.920 --> 41:31.082
- Where is she?
- She's, she's...

41:33.360 --> 41:36.443
- She what?
- She's...

41:38.480 --> 41:39.641
She what?

41:40.920 --> 41:42.570
She what?!
Look at me, Blake!

41:44.040 --> 41:45.166
Where's Maya?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.729
I'm so sorry.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.691
Hey, man.
We really appreciate your help.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.201
Now.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.610
You just sit back.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.883
And enjoy the view.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.090
I can't stop seeing her face.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.171
I shouldn't have let her on.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.324
You couldn't have stopped her.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.331
I could have jumped in after her.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.485
Nick, don't play this game.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.402
You can't win and trust me,
it never ends.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.810
Why haven't you been back here
for three years?

43:08.400 --> 43:12.803
Every summer, all the little
rich girls around here would

43:12.920 --> 43:15.764
sign up for diving lessons
with Dennis Crim.

43:18.080 --> 43:23.371
He was the hot blonde,
with sensitive blue eyes.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.048
Some kind of teenage fantasy, I guess.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.363
For two summers,
we did everything together.

43:33.400 --> 43:38.201
Then I had to go to college, and
he was never going to leave the water,

43:38.320 --> 43:41.210
so I broke it off.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.641
So a few days
before I was supposed to leave...

43:49.200 --> 43:54.206
he took me to our favorite
diving spot to say goodbye.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.328
We were only down there
for a few minutes...

44:00.040 --> 44:01.565
and suddenly I couldn't breathe.

44:03.560 --> 44:07.724
I figured my air gauge was broken,
so I gave him the signal...

44:11.880 --> 44:15.726
and he just, he just stared at me.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.401
And...

44:20.760 --> 44:25.766
I reached out to share his air and...

44:29.160 --> 44:31.083
and he just kind of drifted away.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.601
Jesus.

44:37.200 --> 44:39.089
Somehow I made it to the surface.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.921
And I climbed up to our skiff and...

44:44.120 --> 44:47.010
I spun around to leave him there and...

44:50.560 --> 44:52.688
I out his face open with the propeller.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.127
It was an accident, Sara.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.088
After I took him to the hospital...

45:08.600 --> 45:09.931
I never went back.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.009
And that was on purpose.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.881
Beth was right, I never should have
brought you guys here.

45:23.800 --> 45:24.801
L-leY'

45:28.120 --> 45:31.567
It's gonna be OK.
Sara, we're going to be OK.

45:33.080 --> 45:34.809
I really wish I could believe you.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.890
My eyes are up here.

45:58.160 --> 45:59.571
Yeah.

46:00.720 --> 46:03.007
I know where your eyes are, darling.

46:03.120 --> 46:07.284
OK, so why don't we just try
to keep this clean, huh?

46:14.720 --> 46:15.926
How big?

46:16.640 --> 46:17.721
Excuse me?

46:20.640 --> 46:21.766
How big?

46:24.840 --> 46:26.888
The shark that got your friend.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.044
How big was it?

46:30.440 --> 46:32.363
I don't know. We didn't see it.

46:33.680 --> 46:36.570
- Must have been a bull.
- Why?

46:36.720 --> 46:41.408
Well, 'cause the bulls, they just wind up
in the damnedest places.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.961
Yeah, a couple years back...

46:45.640 --> 46:49.247
one went all the way upriver,
wound up in Missouri.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.762
That's the Show Me state.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.569
Well, how the hell does it get in a lake?

46:57.720 --> 47:00.929
We had a heavy hurricane season
this year.

47:02.440 --> 47:06.240
My guess is,
maybe one came out of the Gulf,

47:06.360 --> 47:10.490
flooded up over the interstate,
wound up here...

47:11.680 --> 47:13.489
got comfortable and made a home.

47:18.160 --> 47:20.049
Or it could have been something else.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.441
Malik.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.521
What are you doing, man?

47:32.880 --> 47:34.609
West Baltimore rules, Nick.

47:36.160 --> 47:40.006
You take one of mine,
I take one of yours.

47:40.120 --> 47:42.248
Malik, don't be crazy.
Get out of the water.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.486
I'm gonna kill it, Nick!

47:46.520 --> 47:47.521
I have to.

47:47.640 --> 47:50.120
No, you don't. Beth and Gordon
went for help.

47:50.280 --> 47:51.520
And Maya's dead.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.126
Yeah, I know.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.647
No, no, no, you don't know.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.042
Look, you got a nice GPA
and all that, all right?

48:02.600 --> 48:04.728
But you don't know
a damn thing about this.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.810
She was my life, man.

48:07.720 --> 48:10.291
She was the only part of me
that I couldn't lose.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.681
I'm sorry, Malik.

48:15.680 --> 48:19.321
We boys, all right? We're boys.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.047
But you need to take
your ass back inside.

48:30.920 --> 48:33.002
- How you going to find it?
- I'm not.

48:33.960 --> 48:35.200
It's going to find me.

48:43.440 --> 48:46.603
Hey, what's going on?

48:46.720 --> 48:48.085
What's wrong with the engine?

48:51.600 --> 48:53.090
Nothing wrong with the engine.

48:53.240 --> 48:55.322
Well, then, why'd you stop?
We got to get the Medevac out to Malik.

48:55.440 --> 48:58.011
Sit down.

49:01.320 --> 49:02.731
Come on. Sit down.

49:07.880 --> 49:09.689
Five minutes, we're good to go.

49:10.200 --> 49:13.044
Five minutes? Five minutes to what?

49:15.800 --> 49:19.088
Five minutes to show time, darling.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.690
Malik, please, man.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.241
Come on!

50:18.480 --> 50:19.891
Malik!

50:26.080 --> 50:27.161
Come on!

50:55.080 --> 50:57.765
This doesn't feel right.
Why does he have the computer on?

50:57.880 --> 51:00.531
Hey, Buddy. Got any
new friend requests?

51:01.640 --> 51:04.928
I'm Gordon79,
if you want to stay in touch.

51:08.600 --> 51:09.931
You. On your feet.

51:10.160 --> 51:13.562
- I need some help.
- Me?

51:18.400 --> 51:20.050
- Don't get up.
- It's fine.

51:22.960 --> 51:24.121
What do you want me to do?

51:25.480 --> 51:26.845
I want you to get in the water.

51:30.960 --> 51:33.804
What? No. I'm not going to get
in the water.

51:35.600 --> 51:37.682
- In the water, now!
- Calm down.

51:37.800 --> 51:40.326
- It's fine. it's fine.
- Get in the water.

51:40.440 --> 51:43.762
Listen. I can't get in the water.
There's a...

51:43.880 --> 51:45.006
A shark?

51:45.520 --> 51:48.683
- Yeah, I know.
- Who do you think put them there?

51:50.080 --> 51:51.206
Oh, my God.

51:52.360 --> 51:53.521
OK, OK.

51:55.880 --> 51:56.881
Just.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.683
Dennis, please don't make me.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.848
- No!
- You'll get your turn.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.002
- No!
- You'll get your turn, baby.

53:31.360 --> 53:32.964
I told you I'd kill it.

53:34.040 --> 53:35.610
Yeah.

53:39.120 --> 53:42.010
The shark that I saw
wasn't a hammerhead.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.485
What?

53:44.240 --> 53:47.642
It swam right past me, and it was
a completely different shark.

53:48.960 --> 53:50.371
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

53:51.480 --> 53:54.643
Yeah, I just, I don't know
how the hell they got in here.

53:57.080 --> 54:00.289
I don't know, during hurricane season
they open the floodgates

54:00.400 --> 54:02.004
underneath the I-10.

54:02.720 --> 54:05.644
I don't know, all that Gulf water
pouring in, maybe they...

54:06.200 --> 54:08.487
maybe they snuck in somehow.
I don't know.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.211
Or maybe someone put them there.

54:18.560 --> 54:19.800
What the hell is that?

54:20.680 --> 54:22.011
It's a camera.

54:22.120 --> 54:24.088
What?

54:24.840 --> 54:27.366
- I'm taking him across.
- What? What are you talking about?

54:27.480 --> 54:28.845
How fast is your Wave runner?

54:29.360 --> 54:31.886
- Blake, I think we should just wait for...
- No. Look at him!

54:32.840 --> 54:35.047
How much longer did you want
to just sit here and wait?

54:35.160 --> 54:36.730
Blake, listen, man,
we can't take him back in the water.

54:36.840 --> 54:39.446
I'm not just going to sit here
and watch him die, Nick!

54:40.360 --> 54:42.044
Are you guys going to help me, or what?

54:45.600 --> 54:47.125
Who are you freaks?

54:48.040 --> 54:51.965
Isn't that sweet, Red?
She wants to get to know us better.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.808
- Bra and panties.
- Screw you.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.050
Screw both of you.

54:59.280 --> 55:01.089
OK, OK, OK.

55:09.400 --> 55:11.926
Oh, nice.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.722
They going to like them titties.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.364
Oh, yeah.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.401
That's a mighty fine rack of lamb.

55:41.080 --> 55:42.445
Red, I like this one.

55:46.600 --> 55:47.601
No!

55:48.120 --> 55:50.122
Red! Red.

55:52.520 --> 55:53.601
Relax.

55:56.880 --> 55:58.450
Scars build character.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.809
Just a little nibble.

56:01.720 --> 56:02.721
Red.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.202
Do you know how many species
of sharks there are?

56:16.120 --> 56:17.201
- No.
- No?

56:18.680 --> 56:22.082
There's 350.

56:22.760 --> 56:24.330
Yeah, that's right.

56:25.160 --> 56:26.366
It's a lot.

56:27.080 --> 56:30.448
I know. I've been diving with them forever.

56:30.800 --> 56:34.441
Bulls, nurses,

56:34.560 --> 56:36.801
threshers, lemons.

56:38.560 --> 56:40.562
Hell, I've only seen,
how many, now, Red?

56:40.720 --> 56:45.009
Forty-five, as of yesterday, but...

56:45.520 --> 56:47.682
we went diving this morning.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.164
Guess what we found?

56:52.920 --> 56:54.729
This makes 46.

56:56.320 --> 56:59.210
- I'm sorry about earlier, man.
- Hey, don't worry about it.

56:59.480 --> 57:01.840
We'll hug it out on the other side,
just get him across, OK?

57:19.280 --> 57:20.964
Red, pan the camera a little left.

57:22.040 --> 57:23.121
What is that?

57:27.040 --> 57:28.201
It's pretty, huh?

57:29.480 --> 57:31.050
They're called photophores.

57:31.680 --> 57:34.809
That means cells that light up.

57:35.560 --> 57:39.281
- Unique to?
- Isi... Isitoru... Isi...

57:39.400 --> 57:42.563
isistius brasiliensis.

57:42.680 --> 57:44.569
Isi... exactly.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.964
Or more commonly known as...

57:48.240 --> 57:49.969
the cookie-cutter shark.

57:58.040 --> 57:59.485
Goodbye, boys.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.720
You know what else is weird about them?

58:23.040 --> 58:25.042
They swallow their own teeth.

58:26.240 --> 58:28.607
That's the only way
they can get calcium.

58:28.720 --> 58:33.601
'Cause their normal diet
is nothing more than... skin, blubber.

58:36.400 --> 58:37.401
Flesh.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.411
Get me out of here.

58:51.520 --> 58:52.840
Get in there. Get in there tight.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.321
Yeah.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.560
- Get in there.
- All right. All right.

59:27.400 --> 59:28.686
That's it, man.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.646
The end.

59:41.680 --> 59:44.490
- Hey, kids, what's shaking?
- Did the Medevac come?

59:44.640 --> 59:45.971
- Is Malik OK?
- Is he at the hospital?

59:46.080 --> 59:47.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.330
- Slow your roll.
- Wait, nobody sent you?

59:49.480 --> 59:51.289
I saw the bonfire.

59:53.080 --> 59:55.082
What in the hell is that?

59:55.920 --> 59:58.764
Hang in there, buddy,
hang in there, Malik.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.969
We're almost there, buddy,
hang in there.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.047
Malik, you OK? You with me?

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.131
We're almost there, buddy.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.326
I don't give a rat's ass.
Look, tell Fish and Game

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.522
I want eyes on that lake yesterday.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.166
And make sure St. Francis
has trauma on standby. 10-10.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.842
- Anything?
- We got more boats in the water

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.760
and Manchac P.D.'s sitting cars on piers,
so, we'll find them.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.844
- Nick, are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.489
Nick, hey!

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.650
- Nick.
- I think he just fainted.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.683
- Come on, let's help him to the couch.
- OK.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.721
Grab his legs.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.207
Not too much longer, buddy, all right?

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.203
I'm not taking you with me, Blake.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.648
Malik, no! No!

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.645
Malik!

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.964
Oh, God! No! No, Malik!

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.329
He's sleeping just
like a little baby.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.122
All the stress
probably just got to him.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.527
Hey, Sar-bear, why don't you do him
a favor and go get a really cold towel

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.205
and we'll bring this boy
back to life?

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.130
OK. Anything else?

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.807
Nope. All I need is right there.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.761
Sherman?

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.201
Sherman?

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.930
Make it extra special cold,
all right, Sar-bear?

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.969
What's your 20, Sheriff?
You missed a hell of a happy hour.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.446
Made a blood smoothie
out of that tattoo chick.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.041
Now why don't you bring blondie out here
so we can have ourselves some fun?

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.721
Sheriff

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.767
Sara?

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.962
- Sara!
- I'm coming.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.363
I just saved your ass, Greg.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.760
Rock and roll, partner.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.285
You know, if you two could just get past
the whole "who tore up whose face" thing,

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.522
y'all would make an adorable couple.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.609
Why'd you try to run, Sara?

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.411
You made it all hard on yourself.
You should have had the soup.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.249
Sweet dreams, baby.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.411
Good shot, partner.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.205
- Where's Nick?
- So that's your type now?

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.851
- I bet he's a good listener.
- Where is he?

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.165
He's playing with the Sheriff.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.125
Why are you doing this, Dennis?

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.404
I'm sorry. I missed that.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.724
Would you mind repeating it
in the ear you didn't run over?

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.442
It was an accident. I swear to God
it was an accident.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.087
I was drowning, OK?
I couldn't breathe.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.890
I was drowning.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.650
But you didn't, Sara.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.083
You sure you were out of air?

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.450
'Cause I sure as hell remember waking up
in the hospital with my face falling off.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.561
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.888
Damn it, Red,
I told you not to bring the dog.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.570
Oh, come on, Dennis.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.762
He just needs a little bit of attention.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.010
- That's right.
- Get rid of him.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.888
- Can we just keep him?
- No, you can't keep him.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.730
- He's so pretty, look at him.
- Get rid of him.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.763
All right.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.161
No.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.322
Oh, you bastard. Sherman.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.646
Tiger sharks.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.164
Also known as requiems.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.649
That ain't too perfect, is it?

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.803
Dustbins of the sea,
they'll eat anything...

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.527
license plates,
tin cans, college pricks.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.127
Oh, yeah, I bet people
like to watch that.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.840
Watch?

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.640
What are you talking about?

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.681
Well, we popped our cherry
on that one last month.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.767
This beamed back up to us...

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.522
from an 8-foot thresher
we threw in the lake.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.211
What is this?

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.883
Well, I know it's not good etiquette,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.890
but I'm going to answer your question
with a question.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:30.046
What is cable television's
longest running programming event?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.090
Last year alone, it was watched
by over 20 million viewers.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.044
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.171
Shark Week, loser.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.048
And a few of those 20 million...

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:48.563
want to watch the real hardcore shit
you can't get on basic cable.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.167
And we're willing to bet
that they'll pay top dollar for it.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.326
You're sick.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.528
There's no such thing
as sickness anymore.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.965
It's all moral relativism. Come on,
you remember Faces of Death?

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.401
Real killing on tape?
Banned in 40 countries.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.326
An eight-year-old can download it
on the Internet today for free, man.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.399
Come on. It's beyond good and evil.
Someone's got to raise the bar.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.603
Here's an interesting factoid
for you, Nick.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:20.720
The cameras that we use
are the same ones...

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.961
that they used
on March of the Penguins.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.011
You know what would be funny?

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.081
To hear Morgan Freeman do a voice over

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.841
of you getting your head torn off
by that beautiful animal right there.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.404
So what happened, Sara?

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.283
I was 18, OK? I was scared...

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.443
I didn't know how to handle the situation.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.284
I Couldn't even look at myself.
How could I bear to look at you?

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.130
Were you scarred on the inside?

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.562
God, it's been, it's been
three years since...

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.408
I haven't been able to come close
to another guy.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.041
Please.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.962
I came back here to make it right.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.806
I loved you.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.004
I loved you so much.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.801
I never forgot that, ever.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.441
- Whoa. Hey, easy, now.
- Just shut up!

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.969
- Open the goddamn cage, now.
- Easy now.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.441
Shut up!

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.405
Easy now.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.481
Bitch!

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.321
Carl.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.887
It's almost dawn.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.525
Wake up the big girl.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.089
It's feeding time.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.801
Copy that.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.082
Hundreds of millions of years of evolution
perfected these babies.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.044
They can smell a single drop of blood...

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.887
in a body of water
the size of an Olympic swimming pool.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.451
No!

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.240
You don't have to do this.
Sabin, this can't be worth it!

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.806
It's worth it, man. Yeah, it's worth it.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.527
I'm willing to give up my position
as lowly janitor on the lake.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.969
I let someone else get shat on by rich
college punks for 12 bucks an hour, man,

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.208
I see it. Whoo-hoo!

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.210
"Retard sheriff."
"I can buy and sell you."

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.004
Well, I bought you, Nick.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.403
And I own you.
So now I'm going to sell you.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.688
No. No!

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.131
No!

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.686
Oh, yeah.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.768
Come on, just pretend it's a carnival.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.368
It's like a big old dunk tank
with a twist.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.006
Please.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.884
Oh, yeah...

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.041
"psych,

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.291
Yeah.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.242
Hey, Nick. You know,
you're 15 times more likely

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.840
to get killed by a falling coconut
than a shark?

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.483
Fifty times more likely to get crushed
by a falling soda machine, man.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.884
Think of it this way, Nick,
you're beating some weird-ass odds.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.809
Whoo!

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.724
Heavy metal music, man, I'm a fan.
Guilty as charged.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.482
Yeah, I love the old big hair metal.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.962
I'd wear leather pants on the force
if they'd let me,

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:31.005
but if there's something you'd rather
listen to while you're dying,

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.406
the sheriff takes requests.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.289
How about some Guns and Roses?

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.011
What was that?

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.170
- Guns and Roses, Sheriff.
- I know what you're trying to do.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.847
You're making me love you. All right!

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.010
It's working, yeah! Whoo!

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.963
Happens to be my favorite.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.450
Come on, man! Oh, don't, Nick!

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.560
Dennis, no, please,
you don't have to do this.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.285
Please, HO.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.050
We had some good times, Sara.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.647
What are you doing?
What are you going to do?

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.841
It's a shame.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.246
Dennis. Dennis, please
let me out of here.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.130
- Dennis!
- Bring her up!

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.687
- Nick!
- Bring her up.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.365
Come on, Dennis.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.525
Dennis. This ain't funny.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.487
OK. All right.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.121
Hey, Sara, looks like your lucky day.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.563
- Nick.
- Your white knight is here.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.922
You want to play poker, son,
you better know what you're holding.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.366
Hang on, Sara.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:41.841
Nick.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.401
Hold on, Sara.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.326
Behind you.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.205
Nick! Nick!

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.881
Sara!

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.481
Fuck you!

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.361
Sherman.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.369
Sherman, good boy, good boy.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.688
Good boy, Sherman.
Good boy, Sherman.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.041
OK.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.447
Come on, Sara.
Come on, Sara!

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.886
Come on, Sara!

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:51.681
Breathe!

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.726
Come on!
Come on, come on.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.888
Yes, OK.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.171
Just breathe. It's OK.
It's OK. It's over.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.166
It's over.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.721
Thank you.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.401
English - US - PSDH
