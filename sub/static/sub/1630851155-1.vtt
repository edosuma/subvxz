WEBVTT

04:33.738 --> 04:35.540
They say that when flies

04:35.574 --> 04:39.679
become sticky, it means
a storm is brewing.

05:21.887 --> 05:22.789
I am Juan.

05:24.389 --> 05:25.357
Tell me, Juan,

05:27.425 --> 05:29.728
why has nobody taken this
house for their home?

05:30.562 --> 05:33.433
Old man once
lived here, señor.

05:35.867 --> 05:38.603
There is a hole in the roof.

05:58.857 --> 06:00.727
Señor, who are you?

06:01.959 --> 06:04.896
 Alonzo.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.499
Alonzo Murrieta.

07:31.850 --> 07:33.753
Sir, I can help you with that.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.059
I don't know who in hell
you think you are, Mister,

09:20.091 --> 09:22.594
but that's our well
you're stealing from.

09:24.395 --> 09:26.598
My grandfather
built that well.

09:28.866 --> 09:31.803
I say you ain't nothing
but a thieving trespasser.

09:31.836 --> 09:32.737
Search him.

09:42.980 --> 09:43.781
He's unshucked.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.953
Your grandpa, huh?

09:47.852 --> 09:50.755
Should imagine that gives
a man a right to a drink.

09:50.788 --> 09:53.825
That depends on what side
of town he might be from, see?

09:53.859 --> 09:56.862
Last I heard, we done
shifted the border over some.

09:56.894 --> 10:00.065
That is to say, we ain't
in no Mexico no more, boy.

10:01.232 --> 10:02.767
What brings you here?

10:04.235 --> 10:07.238
I'm here to reclaim
my father's possessions.

10:07.272 --> 10:09.075
Pedro Alonzo Murrieta.

10:10.741 --> 10:12.777
It was his dying wish
that I reclaim his house.

10:12.811 --> 10:14.680
Why would a man think
of this cursed place

10:14.712 --> 10:15.213
when he busy dying?

10:15.246 --> 10:17.048
Don't make no sense.

10:17.081 --> 10:17.982
Don't make no sense, Verne.

10:18.015 --> 10:18.984
What do you think?

10:20.052 --> 10:22.922
I think I'll strip him
out of them fancy clothes,

10:23.989 --> 10:25.024
put him in a wooden suit.

10:26.224 --> 10:27.760
He may even be rich.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.996
Did you come in a wagon?

10:31.028 --> 10:31.763
Huh?

10:32.864 --> 10:36.636
Hell, ain't this one lucky day?

10:37.836 --> 10:38.738
Huh?

10:40.038 --> 10:41.006
Shut up, Reid.

10:41.038 --> 10:42.941
I ain't shutting up, Cooper.

10:43.741 --> 10:45.243
No siree, Mother's
already digging

10:45.277 --> 10:47.947
a grave for this lying squatter.

10:53.118 --> 10:54.020
Beautiful.

11:05.062 --> 11:06.197
I can kill him now, huh?

11:07.231 --> 11:08.967
  brother.

11:11.870 --> 11:13.806
They don't mean no good.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.108
They'll wreck his
pants in this place.

11:21.913 --> 11:25.884
Now, why don't you tell us
what you're doing, Mister?

11:25.917 --> 11:28.988
'Cause I ain't seen shit worth
a Boston dollar around here.

11:30.087 --> 11:35.727
The house, ruined as it
may be, I'm making a claim.

11:38.096 --> 11:39.098
May I?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.862
Mexican bosch.

12:12.029 --> 12:13.098
The house deeds.

12:20.572 --> 12:22.274
I bet he killed that man.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.845
You killed that man you call
your father, you yellow screw?

12:27.946 --> 12:32.785
I came to claim my house
and my share of water.

12:37.589 --> 12:39.992
You want some of
that there water, huh?

12:40.024 --> 12:43.961
Well, you can just go right
on ahead and take some.

12:51.302 --> 12:52.837
Come on, y'all.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.139
Better not keep me,
.

12:55.974 --> 12:56.775
There's water for everyone.

12:56.807 --> 12:59.043
Today, you can
take what you want.

13:20.331 --> 13:22.066
That bastard knows something.

13:51.229 --> 13:55.334
I was born alone, now
I'll surely die alone

13:55.366 --> 13:57.135
if I'm to stay here.

14:00.471 --> 14:01.372
Forgive me.

14:33.971 --> 14:36.040
I'm gonna make the bell sing.

14:36.073 --> 14:38.109
I'm gonna get you
boys outta bed.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.059
Close.

14:54.725 --> 14:55.994
Real close.

15:04.535 --> 15:05.904
Like this.

15:44.075 --> 15:45.244
You a greedy man.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.016
Greedy man don't got
no place in Dry River.

15:51.048 --> 15:53.151
I draw only what you allow.

15:54.351 --> 15:55.553
Once a day.

15:55.586 --> 15:57.421
Just like the rest.

15:57.455 --> 15:58.958
You double dipping.

16:02.594 --> 16:05.030
Go on and finish up
now then, grandpa.

16:06.197 --> 16:07.099
Go on now!

16:14.438 --> 16:17.308
Dang, Reid, your aim's
just as bad as your coffee!

16:18.610 --> 16:22.247
Well, this time I'm
gonna make the bell sing

16:22.279 --> 16:23.481
for you, brother.

16:23.514 --> 16:25.249
 I bet you can't.

17:00.684 --> 17:02.386
Goddamn it.

17:05.521 --> 17:07.224
It was an accident.

17:09.126 --> 17:11.229
It was God's work,
I swear, Cooper.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.134
It was God's work.

17:16.701 --> 17:22.174
Pedro, I always
knew you would return.

17:24.442 --> 17:25.310
Help us.

17:42.192 --> 17:43.061
Water.

17:44.628 --> 17:45.663
Water.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.629
 Clarissa!

18:26.171 --> 18:30.175
Now, let this be a
lesson to all y'all!

18:31.241 --> 18:34.112
Even fate don't got no
sympathy for rule-breakers.

18:34.945 --> 18:38.716
Out here, we decide who
drinks and who dies.

18:46.391 --> 18:47.426
Comprende?

18:49.727 --> 18:51.396
Huh?

18:55.633 --> 18:57.169
Damn straight!

20:02.299 --> 20:05.369
There's enough for a few
weeks of muddy tortillas, Papa.

20:07.571 --> 20:08.673
Don't you go now worrying.

20:22.886 --> 20:26.390
I hear they raise
prize cattle Midwest.

20:27.825 --> 20:29.528
That's what you need.

20:36.433 --> 20:40.504
I'll be able to live
on what you leave me.

20:42.906 --> 20:49.247
At the well earlier,
there was a stranger.

20:51.648 --> 20:54.852
A man, just another man.

20:54.885 --> 20:58.589
 A gentle soul.

20:59.891 --> 21:02.761
I ain't interested in
no light-footed stranger.

21:03.594 --> 21:06.498
He'll be going on,
like all them others.

21:06.530 --> 21:09.267
He smelled of
honesty, Clarissa.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.654
Hold still.

21:29.686 --> 21:32.856
Whatever in hell do
I need to be clean for?

21:32.890 --> 21:34.459
Shush, Father.

23:09.586 --> 23:13.924
The man that died at the
well, he recognized you.

23:13.958 --> 23:16.595
It was my father
he recognized.

23:18.061 --> 23:19.697
We wear the same face.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.603
The same clothes, also.

23:26.002 --> 23:27.505
Same eyes.

23:29.707 --> 23:30.776
And the same gun.

23:33.044 --> 23:34.746
They best work
together when you come

23:34.778 --> 23:36.414
from a family of hunters.

23:38.950 --> 23:39.818
Some water?

23:40.951 --> 23:43.654
Take it, I have enough.

23:44.055 --> 23:48.693
There's no such luxury
here, not normally.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.430
Then I travel with
good luck on my side.

23:52.096 --> 23:55.867
Good luck doesn't go
by the name of Dry River.

23:56.701 --> 24:00.839
There's nothing but ruin and,
beyond that, only desert.

24:04.541 --> 24:06.544
I must get back to my father.

24:07.577 --> 24:10.848
He'd like you to eat
with us, if you care to.

24:11.715 --> 24:13.818
If she'd care
for me to oblige,

24:16.554 --> 24:18.557
I may be more than
willing to accept.

24:19.923 --> 24:21.459
She would.

25:01.332 --> 25:03.101
What do you
think you're doing?

25:03.134 --> 25:05.504
Back the hell away!

25:08.038 --> 25:09.974
Stubborn like a mule.

25:16.913 --> 25:19.049
Let me see that face.

25:31.895 --> 25:35.599
Murrieta, sure thing!

25:49.814 --> 25:51.349
A gentleman should
remove his gun

25:51.382 --> 25:53.552
if he's to dine at the table.

25:54.652 --> 25:55.820
My apologies, Miss.

25:59.923 --> 26:01.658
Pedro Murrieta.

26:01.692 --> 26:04.796
He said he'd find where
the rain had gone.

26:04.828 --> 26:05.829
The mountains.

26:06.963 --> 26:08.966
Quiet's all he was.

26:12.103 --> 26:13.872
I would've brought him here.

26:19.009 --> 26:19.910
Men came.

26:22.980 --> 26:23.882
Landowners,

26:26.884 --> 26:29.621
empowered by Porfirio
Diaz's regime.

26:33.657 --> 26:39.697
They took his
land, and his life.

26:42.967 --> 26:45.003
 Well, that
ain't good to hear.

26:48.005 --> 26:49.007
I sorted them.

26:51.976 --> 26:52.977
I did.

27:00.917 --> 27:03.787
And with that, I wish
for no hunting no more.

27:03.820 --> 27:07.958
Did he ever mention
the burial of a priest?

27:09.759 --> 27:13.831
A priest with a
passion for gold.

27:15.266 --> 27:16.835
No, sir.

27:17.968 --> 27:21.439
The only name he mentioned
was before his last breath.

27:21.471 --> 27:23.807
That of Miguel de Sandoval.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.843
Do you know where
Don Miguel rests?

27:27.912 --> 27:28.880
I do not, Miss.

27:30.047 --> 27:31.950
Then it's for the better good.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.020
I figure this is in
relation to those settlers.

27:35.920 --> 27:40.925
Don Miguel, the priest,
he beguiled the villagers

27:40.958 --> 27:45.029
to his faith, convinced
them that the statue

27:45.061 --> 27:46.229
in the church would turn to gold

27:46.262 --> 27:48.098
if they followed him in prayer.

27:48.898 --> 27:51.935
One day, the town woke
up to find exactly that.

27:52.936 --> 27:56.173
I heard similar
tales, mainly from men

27:56.207 --> 27:58.677
with a crazy, yellow
gleam in their eye.

27:59.109 --> 28:02.913
Fool's gold, maybe,
but it don't much deter

28:02.946 --> 28:05.115
the likes of those
that come looking.

28:11.154 --> 28:15.726
I assure you, an empty
house with a hole in its roof

28:15.759 --> 28:17.861
is as much as I'm
laying claim to.

28:22.799 --> 28:25.769
I gathered a few
of Murrieta's things.

28:27.337 --> 28:31.008
The trunk in the stable,
it's still there.

28:32.343 --> 28:33.878
We'll find it.

28:39.950 --> 28:43.955
Do you see any future, son?

28:46.289 --> 28:50.794
I lost my future when
I bloodied my hands

28:50.827 --> 28:52.930
with my father's murderers.

28:56.267 --> 28:58.103
All I hoped to find
here was peace.

29:01.204 --> 29:03.107
I guess there is no such place.

30:14.444 --> 30:15.813
Dry River.

30:26.957 --> 30:28.960
Do you still
think he's honest?

30:31.461 --> 30:34.998
His heart beats strong,

30:36.000 --> 30:40.939
whether for love or
gold, I neither know.

31:00.257 --> 31:01.459
 Follow me.

31:52.142 --> 31:53.311
See those tracks?

31:55.445 --> 31:58.115
Supply wagons use this route.

31:59.316 --> 32:05.023
They used to stop here, but
gave up on us a few years ago.

32:07.557 --> 32:09.259
It's like waiting for the rain.

32:11.362 --> 32:13.197
Then they're sure to return.

32:15.566 --> 32:20.571
They will come, but
not while word is out

32:20.604 --> 32:22.974
there are robbers among us.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.247
How far to the nearest towns?

32:31.015 --> 32:34.485
About five full days'
ride that way, Nogales.

32:35.152 --> 32:37.989
Seven the other way to El Paso.

32:39.155 --> 32:42.960
I used to travel there often
before Boone lost his sight.

32:46.063 --> 32:49.267
she also went blind.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.370
A fash of gunpowder
from a faulty round.

32:55.605 --> 32:58.208
My father likes to
say he lost his sight

32:58.241 --> 33:02.245
from staring
incessantly straight

33:02.278 --> 33:05.415
at the bright, blinding
beauty of my mother.

33:11.521 --> 33:15.192
What will a hunter prey in
a starved country like this?

33:23.133 --> 33:26.270
We're the ones
being hunted tonight.

33:26.303 --> 33:27.405
We should get back.

34:36.139 --> 34:37.440
Good evening, ma'am.

35:40.670 --> 35:42.439
You take my water?

36:03.793 --> 36:04.794
Good try, boy.

36:14.371 --> 36:16.374
There's more lead
in him than meat.

36:17.673 --> 36:19.742
No joke, you
ungrateful bastard.

36:19.775 --> 36:20.676
Yeah, but how many
times did you have

36:20.710 --> 36:23.780
to go shoot the poor
little critter, huh?

36:23.813 --> 36:25.682
This ain't no time to
go wasting bullets!

36:25.715 --> 36:27.450
Hell, I have enough
bullets left to make

36:27.483 --> 36:29.552
a colander out of
your ugly face.

36:29.585 --> 36:30.553
Dang, Reid!

36:30.586 --> 36:32.455
When are you gonna learn
to start using your head

36:32.489 --> 36:34.592
for something
other than combing?

36:43.867 --> 36:46.570
Wasting bullets or wasting time,

36:46.603 --> 36:48.539
we ain't got time to do neither.

36:49.773 --> 36:51.509
Clean yourselves up.

36:53.043 --> 36:54.445
Damned disgrace.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.281
Reid's been hunting.

36:59.615 --> 37:01.351
Stupid asses.

37:02.351 --> 37:06.223
Get it on a plate, and wipe
the blood off the table!

37:08.425 --> 37:12.530
That little prince, he thinks
he's some kind of sheriff.

37:14.297 --> 37:17.467
I trust him about as much
as I trust you, Cooper.

37:17.501 --> 37:20.838
At least he has the
decency to visit the church.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.606
Because he knows
something, that's why.

37:22.639 --> 37:27.278
If he does, then the
Lord God brought him to us.

37:27.311 --> 37:30.248
Me, I don't
believe in nothing.

37:31.547 --> 37:32.415
Only this.

37:34.684 --> 37:35.752
Mother's become
so damned religious,

37:35.786 --> 37:39.623
she's training the town
rats to stand up and pray.

37:45.661 --> 37:49.766
Tomorrow, we can really start,

37:49.800 --> 37:53.404
dig out the last section
where we planned.

37:54.570 --> 37:57.340
We are close now.

37:58.574 --> 38:04.547
Once the news spreads, people
will come from far and beyond.

38:06.349 --> 38:10.420
Women will come and
build their homes here,

38:11.420 --> 38:14.691
and their communities
under new laws.

38:15.858 --> 38:20.397
Hear me when I say,
they will come.

38:21.697 --> 38:24.400
They will!

38:24.434 --> 38:27.638
War widows will come,
and they'll turn

38:27.670 --> 38:35.312
this dirty wasteland into a
fertile, child-rearing plain.

38:38.949 --> 38:42.920
♪ Near the priest,
I asked my boys ♪

38:42.952 --> 38:45.955
♪ Whenever there's a storm ♪

38:45.989 --> 38:49.827
♪ Montana is too cold for me ♪

38:49.860 --> 38:52.529
♪ The winters are too long ♪

38:52.561 --> 38:54.931
♪ Before the rounds do begin ♪

38:54.965 --> 38:58.536
♪ The money is all gone ♪

39:00.170 --> 39:01.439
 What we got here?

39:04.740 --> 39:05.942
Howdy, stranger.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.378
 Just shut
up and dig, Reid.

39:07.411 --> 39:09.513
We need to find the damn statue.

39:09.545 --> 39:10.513
Get out the way.

39:34.003 --> 39:35.705
Dang, there's nothing here.

39:38.574 --> 39:41.978
That priest, I reckon
he was as crooked

39:42.012 --> 39:43.614
as a dog's hind legs.

39:43.646 --> 39:46.516
Yeah, well, you try
telling sweet Mother that.

39:47.483 --> 39:50.520
We got one spot left to
try, boys, and that's it.

39:54.590 --> 39:56.659
 Who in the
hell do he think he is?

40:00.230 --> 40:04.668
He ain't been doing
much but mending his roof.

40:04.701 --> 40:05.870
Old Reid's been watching.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.589
This place is much improved.

41:02.592 --> 41:05.529
I had a mind to come
find you as soon as it was.

41:12.101 --> 41:13.803
I can't stay here.

41:16.672 --> 41:18.608
It's not safe for me to stay.

41:26.682 --> 41:29.585
A couple of days ago,
they did it again.

41:29.619 --> 41:33.123
Knocked a man galley-west for
taking one bucket of water.

41:33.155 --> 41:36.893
Yeah, I heard it,
from the boy Juan.

41:38.827 --> 41:42.899
Child of that age should not
have to witness such savagery.

41:55.177 --> 41:57.113
It was beautiful here once.

42:13.163 --> 42:16.133
You really do think
the rains will come?

43:40.050 --> 43:45.055
Might could just as well
be digging our own graves.

43:49.693 --> 43:52.696
A man sure as hell needs to be

43:53.896 --> 43:55.731
fixing to make
something of himself

43:55.764 --> 43:57.734
if he wants to
call himself a man.

43:59.936 --> 44:04.108
Needs a pretty woman,
too, real pretty.

44:05.175 --> 44:07.210
Like Clarissa Hawkins.

44:07.242 --> 44:10.146
Don't you even dream
of her, you dirty dog!

44:15.318 --> 44:16.787
Good day, brother.

44:18.253 --> 44:19.956
May I ask you of water?

44:23.126 --> 44:24.061
I trade you.

44:28.030 --> 44:29.198
Here.

44:29.231 --> 44:30.133
Take it.

44:31.201 --> 44:32.069
Take it.

44:33.202 --> 44:35.871
It will bring fortune on you.

44:35.905 --> 44:37.174
Take it.

44:37.206 --> 44:38.675
It's all I have.

44:58.327 --> 44:59.962
Sorry to be nosy.

44:59.996 --> 45:02.166
I just saw you .

45:03.333 --> 45:06.136
I just follow you.

45:09.005 --> 45:10.307
You're leaving.

45:12.041 --> 45:12.943
On foot?

45:19.916 --> 45:23.854
There is nothing here
left for me to hold on to.

45:26.255 --> 45:30.126
If I stay, I die.

45:32.094 --> 45:37.133
But if I go, I might
die, too.

45:45.875 --> 45:49.079
I'd rather feed the
vultures than die

45:50.146 --> 45:51.949
down there by bullets.

45:58.855 --> 46:03.761
Greed, fools,
digging for nothing.

46:04.893 --> 46:05.762
Maybe.

46:06.963 --> 46:07.865
Maybe not.

46:09.264 --> 46:11.200
Perhaps they dig
in the wrong place.

46:14.036 --> 46:18.007
Soil, gold, makes
no difference.

46:19.309 --> 46:20.343
Takes more than food and water

46:20.376 --> 46:22.179
for the human soul to thrive.

46:28.217 --> 46:31.187
You came here with good
intentions huh?

46:31.221 --> 46:32.823
I hear that.

46:35.057 --> 46:39.796
But beware, to bring
honor to this town,

46:40.996 --> 46:45.001
it might cost you your life.

47:02.452 --> 47:04.955
When did you draw this water?

47:04.987 --> 47:06.088
Sunup.

47:06.123 --> 47:12.029
Hmm, I have taste this
before, and it was bad medicine.

47:16.365 --> 47:18.100
Hold up, sheriff.

47:18.134 --> 47:21.038
I'll put a bullet right
between your pretty eyes.

47:24.072 --> 47:26.075
Time we all got
properly acquainted.

47:32.114 --> 47:33.850
You're safe here.

47:36.119 --> 47:40.991
So you are Alonzo Murrieta,
son of Pedro Murrieta,

47:41.023 --> 47:42.491
a man who buried the dead.

47:42.525 --> 47:44.261
You've been well informed.

47:47.030 --> 47:50.167
I got everything
he owns right here.

47:53.168 --> 47:56.072
This sucker ain't worth a
can of corned beef no more.

47:59.275 --> 48:00.277
Mama.

48:03.012 --> 48:04.214
You wanna take a look?

48:09.351 --> 48:11.187
Fine drawings.

48:13.489 --> 48:15.893
A worthy document.

48:18.061 --> 48:21.298
Pedro Murrieta was a
man of many talents.

48:24.467 --> 48:26.703
He must've been a good father.

48:26.735 --> 48:27.703
Brought me up
well enough to know

48:27.737 --> 48:30.307
a family of jackals,
should I run into them.

48:34.043 --> 48:37.314
It must be so
tiresome to be so alone.

48:38.313 --> 48:40.482
I don't blame your bitterness.

48:40.516 --> 48:44.354
Us humans weren't
born to live alone.

48:44.387 --> 48:46.056
Wouldn't you agree?

48:47.190 --> 48:52.930
Family is the most important
institution for humans.

48:53.429 --> 48:56.300
And family needs rules.

48:57.166 --> 49:02.272
Without them, life descends
into a spiral of sin.

49:03.539 --> 49:09.980
You, I wonder, so
handsome, so young,

49:10.346 --> 49:14.551
why'd you come to this
decayed and thirsty town

49:14.583 --> 49:17.052
that's only meant for the dead?

49:17.085 --> 49:20.122
I'm here to honor my
father, and the town

49:20.155 --> 49:24.159
that his father and his father's
father before him built.

49:24.193 --> 49:25.095
He's lying.

49:26.628 --> 49:30.232
I have lived much,
been shoved around,

49:30.266 --> 49:34.371
stolen from, pushed
to wield a gun.

49:35.637 --> 49:40.977
When I heard about this
place, I had a vision

49:41.244 --> 49:46.249
that there was a town that
history could be rewritten.

49:46.416 --> 49:51.555
I knew it was me, and
transcend this town, I will.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.057
That's quite some work to
be done against the odds.

49:55.090 --> 49:58.060
There are no odds
that don't shrink

49:58.094 --> 50:00.297
at the point of a gun, son.

50:02.130 --> 50:07.103
I very much believe we
share a common ambition.

50:07.536 --> 50:08.337
Don't we?

50:08.371 --> 50:11.141
Except my ambition
for this place

50:11.173 --> 50:15.311
doesn't allow room for
thieves and murderers.

50:16.211 --> 50:19.181
I think it's time you told us

50:19.215 --> 50:22.052
your interest in our business.

50:24.420 --> 50:26.156
I saw him.

50:26.188 --> 50:29.291
Yes, I saw him, when I
was asking for charity.

50:31.561 --> 50:33.296
He was watching you, he was.

50:34.429 --> 50:35.331
He has it.

50:39.568 --> 50:41.237
That thing.

50:49.244 --> 50:50.479
What you up to, stranger?

50:53.682 --> 50:56.185
Gonna tell us the truth
now, ain't you, boy?

50:56.652 --> 50:58.555
I ain't got
nothing to tell you.

50:59.688 --> 51:00.589
Ain't nothing gets
my balls on fire

51:00.623 --> 51:03.425
like a man trying to
take me for a fool.

51:06.128 --> 51:08.064
Blow his bloody brains out.

51:08.731 --> 51:11.101
Blow his bloody brains
out, that's what I say!

51:11.134 --> 51:13.570
Unload that pistol in here,

51:13.603 --> 51:15.472
and you'll have me to answer to!

51:36.726 --> 51:39.196
Wanna play with me, boy, huh?

51:39.494 --> 51:41.330
You wanna play with me?

51:41.364 --> 51:41.898
Come on now.

52:00.782 --> 52:03.419
Get off me, get off me now.

52:04.619 --> 52:05.487
Cooper!

52:16.431 --> 52:18.334
 Get off me!

52:20.235 --> 52:21.437
Got him, brother.

52:23.972 --> 52:25.407
We just playing, Ma.

52:25.440 --> 52:26.341
We just playing.

52:26.375 --> 52:28.411
Ain't no thing.

52:29.512 --> 52:31.414
Enough of this vulgarity.

52:33.516 --> 52:37.154
I was starting to like
you, son of a gravedigger.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.421
You ain't got but
five seconds left

52:38.454 --> 52:42.525
for you to explain what's
in that fancy book of yours.

52:48.264 --> 52:52.202
They're my father's drawings
of old Dry River's town.

52:53.268 --> 52:55.171
Shows how it was
before the drought.

52:55.771 --> 52:58.675
Why, he ain't-
- Let him speak, Cooper.

52:58.708 --> 53:00.777
Give him some
water, not too much.

53:01.577 --> 53:05.248
People been treating this
place like a candy store.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.684
Señor, señor, that
table water is flawed.

53:08.717 --> 53:11.687
I've tasted and
seen, it's no good.

53:11.721 --> 53:13.590
 Shut your mouth!

53:13.623 --> 53:14.591
My mama's talking.

53:18.360 --> 53:20.462
You better start
flapping your gums, boy.

53:23.365 --> 53:26.435
The few that didn't
die of thirst and left

53:26.469 --> 53:29.239
buried what they had so they
could come back for it later.

53:29.271 --> 53:31.240
I ain't interested
in no one else

53:31.273 --> 53:34.276
but Miguel de Sandoval
and what he buried.

53:34.309 --> 53:38.414
There ain't no record of
no priest, and no statue.

53:40.349 --> 53:42.719
He's lying like a rug, Cooper.

53:44.619 --> 53:47.289
He lie, he lying.

53:47.322 --> 53:50.726
He told me you were digging
in the wrong place, huh?

53:53.628 --> 53:54.596
I swear it.

53:54.630 --> 53:55.531
Is this true?

53:55.565 --> 53:57.300
You better start
talking, boy, 'cause I'm

53:57.333 --> 53:59.703
just about down with
digging, you hear me?

54:03.505 --> 54:04.373
The cemetery.

54:05.273 --> 54:07.476
It ain't the only
place they got buried.

54:09.778 --> 54:11.513
 Spit it out, boy.

54:13.782 --> 54:14.683
The orchard.

54:16.351 --> 54:18.053
They used the orchard.

54:18.086 --> 54:22.491
Say, in the interests
of all, we need

54:22.525 --> 54:27.063
strong men for the town,
for those who will come.

54:27.096 --> 54:29.866
You work with me,
and, in return,

54:29.898 --> 54:32.768
God willing, when
all is said and done,

54:32.802 --> 54:38.341
peace will prevail, and that
is what you desire, is it not?

54:40.509 --> 54:43.647
Peaceful will be the day that
sees you riding out of here.

54:45.581 --> 54:50.620
Now, show our new partner
some homegrown respect.

54:52.655 --> 54:54.591
Not too rough on him, boys.

54:55.623 --> 54:58.560
Give him some breathing
space, you got that?

55:00.128 --> 55:01.563
Sure, Mama.

55:01.597 --> 55:03.700
I'll look after him
like my own blood.

55:04.699 --> 55:06.401
Show him home.

55:06.434 --> 55:08.704
We start tomorrow
for the orchard.

55:11.407 --> 55:13.343
One more thing, Murrieta.

55:13.376 --> 55:14.577
We kill deserters.

55:22.851 --> 55:24.753
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

55:51.447 --> 55:53.583
 Damn right.

56:12.934 --> 56:18.507
 Yesiree, I'd eat my
own boots for a taste of rain.

56:21.443 --> 56:23.412
 Shut
your cock holster.

58:48.791 --> 58:49.659
No killing.

58:51.860 --> 58:54.998
You, your father, and
others need to stay safe.

58:56.731 --> 58:57.633
They'll leave.

59:02.170 --> 59:03.839
It's a cruel life.

59:05.940 --> 59:09.645
You get a glimpse of hope,
just to tear it away.

59:16.085 --> 59:20.857
Clarissa, I'm
not dead, not yet.

59:22.657 --> 59:24.626
I intend to survive.

59:26.695 --> 59:29.865
You have, your
father, and many more.

59:29.898 --> 59:31.668
And many have died.

59:35.137 --> 59:38.808
The desert is vast,
that is certain.

59:40.775 --> 59:41.777
But dreams.

59:45.246 --> 59:50.719
My heart is beating,
and I hope yours is, too.

59:53.121 --> 59:54.723
I call that love.

59:57.092 --> 01:00:00.663
My heart is feeling, also,

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:02.965
and nothing can stop that now.

01:00:02.998 --> 01:00:04.601
Not me, not you.

01:00:06.101 --> 01:00:07.937
I call that a gift.

01:00:09.204 --> 01:00:10.073
I am scared.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.211
Despite the
oppression, believe me,

01:00:16.244 --> 01:00:19.081
I would rather die
with you in my sight

01:00:20.048 --> 01:00:21.683
than live anywhere else.

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:29.025
Promise me you
will fight, Alonzo.

01:00:31.025 --> 01:00:32.728
Fight for your life.

01:00:35.463 --> 01:00:37.265
If you die now that
I have found you,

01:00:37.298 --> 01:00:39.034
I will surely die, too.

01:01:15.003 --> 01:01:16.072
Dang, Verne.

01:01:17.072 --> 01:01:19.175
You ain't gonna
do it, brother.

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:21.177
What do we need
him for, anyway?

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.111
We need him.

01:01:22.144 --> 01:01:24.746
I've gone and invested
way too much sweat

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:25.781
to have you take it out from me

01:01:25.813 --> 01:01:28.183
for the infatuation of a woman.

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.919
Yeah, I'm looking
at you, Cooper.

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.988
What do you know
about feelings, huh?

01:01:33.088 --> 01:01:36.693
Straighten out, or I'll
be taking that there gun.

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.795
The hell you will.

01:02:00.815 --> 01:02:02.117
Get some water.

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.118
We're getting low.

01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:05.987
 He's sick.

01:02:08.956 --> 01:02:11.727
That bonny girl he
set his sights on,

01:02:14.963 --> 01:02:16.999
she got eyes for the sheriff.

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:28.544
On your feet.

01:02:30.144 --> 01:02:33.348
Look like this one done caught
that yellow fever, brother!

01:02:36.918 --> 01:02:38.219
Hell, there's no
remains in here,

01:02:38.253 --> 01:02:39.956
but we could easily change that.

01:02:40.588 --> 01:02:42.124
 Where next, sheriff?

01:02:45.427 --> 01:02:48.264
 Hey, he's talking
to you, mountain boy!

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:50.266
Let me tell you something
about those mountains, Cooper!

01:02:50.298 --> 01:02:51.366
Easy, boy.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.202
They're full of animals,
some big, and some small,

01:02:53.235 --> 01:02:56.138
but all of them have brains
bigger than your own.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:56.938
That's why you've been out here

01:02:56.972 --> 01:02:58.808
for six months
and found nothing!

01:03:03.244 --> 01:03:05.146
 You boys need water.

01:03:16.925 --> 01:03:18.928
You might could've killed me.

01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:57.834
Hell.

01:03:59.934 --> 01:04:05.307
Mama, Mama, the well,
the well's almost dry.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.245
It ain't good, no.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:11.981
Then, it never was.

01:04:13.447 --> 01:04:16.217
 Well, what
are we gonna do?

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:17.854
 Carry on, son.

01:04:21.222 --> 01:04:22.257
This ain't right, Mama.

01:04:23.958 --> 01:04:26.261
We should leave while the
horses are still healthy.

01:04:27.461 --> 01:04:29.364
You don't wanna do that, Reid.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:30.967
Think about it.

01:04:31.432 --> 01:04:34.235
You don't wanna abandon
what you've sweated

01:04:34.268 --> 01:04:36.137
so hard for, do you?

01:04:36.704 --> 01:04:39.007
Go back to being nobodies?

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.343
I don't care for
anyone's laughter, Mama.

01:04:41.376 --> 01:04:43.212
I don't need nothing,

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:47.149
nothing else than being alive.

01:04:48.516 --> 01:04:51.119
My gut tells me
this ain't right,

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.088
messing with the dead and all.

01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:56.892
I don't like the way
you're talking, Reid.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:08.237
We Ryles, we stay close,
through good and bad.

01:05:10.304 --> 01:05:12.040
We stick together.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:12.975
Catch.

01:05:21.182 --> 01:05:23.318
Go tell your brothers
we must hurry.

01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:39.168
Now is the time to
plead to the Lord.

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.971
The water in the
well is vanishing.

01:05:42.003 --> 01:05:45.440
We must plead with
truth and propriety.

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:49.145
We must unite our
voices together

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:56.018
to invite the Lord to
reconsider his resolution.

01:06:00.021 --> 01:06:04.325
Dear Lord, in thy
mercy, send rain

01:06:04.358 --> 01:06:06.261
on this dry and waterless town.

01:06:07.295 --> 01:06:08.965
We pray in your name.

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:20.376
These are blessing stones
of the holy church.

01:06:25.579 --> 01:06:27.148
Do as I do.

01:06:27.181 --> 01:06:30.318
We pray in your name.

01:06:30.351 --> 01:06:32.620
Pray.

01:06:32.653 --> 01:06:34.355
As I pray.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.476
Come and pray with me.

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:57.279
 It's not
God I come to find.

01:06:57.846 --> 01:06:59.115
 I see.

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:05.121
 I heard
you at the well.

01:07:06.153 --> 01:07:09.424
I wish to tell you me
and my father's thoughts.

01:07:14.362 --> 01:07:19.502
And why would I be
interested in you?

01:07:22.503 --> 01:07:24.506
Forgive me for saying,

01:07:26.141 --> 01:07:29.345
but waiting for God
to do something,

01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:33.114
it would make more sense
to send the men for help

01:07:33.148 --> 01:07:35.184
to Nogales or El Paso.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:38.187
And what kind of help
do you think we'd get

01:07:38.219 --> 01:07:40.355
with nothing of value here?

01:07:41.255 --> 01:07:44.459
Human lives,
they are valuable.

01:07:45.726 --> 01:07:49.097
If the God you serve
has reached those towns,

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:50.432
they will show us mercy.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.336
I have only ever
seen you in shadow,

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.340
like so many around here.

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.444
We have land.

01:08:02.277 --> 01:08:07.316
The men could go get a loan
and dig the well deeper.

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:10.486
I know when a young
woman exudes love.

01:08:12.219 --> 01:08:15.390
You weren't born to grow
old and lonely here.

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:20.295
This is all about Alonzo
Murrieta, ain't it?

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:23.099
I knew you wouldn't listen.

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:27.103
Faith, young woman!

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:30.206
We must prove our faith!

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:33.108
It's all or nothing.

01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:36.477
 Then
the God you serve

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:38.481
is just as dead as your heart.

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:43.118
Clarissa Hawkins,
no one leaves.

01:08:52.426 --> 01:08:54.529
 The
well is almost empty.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.269
Now, listen.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:07.308
I hear nothing,
only my breathing.

01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:09.478
 Only your fear.

01:09:11.377 --> 01:09:12.412
Listen.

01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:16.517
We have no means.

01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:18.520
Etta is the priest returned.

01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:20.354
She holds the town.

01:09:21.456 --> 01:09:23.225
We must leave.

01:09:23.256 --> 01:09:28.162
I am at the wrong end of life,

01:09:28.563 --> 01:09:32.768
and I didn't make it
all the way to this age

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:35.337
by choosing to follow fear.

01:09:35.368 --> 01:09:42.676
Every scar, every ache,
every white hair you see,

01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:46.482
earned the hard way every
day by not giving up.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.582
Every day.

01:09:50.385 --> 01:09:56.558
Now, you let me
take those with me,

01:09:56.591 --> 01:10:00.796
you let me take the worry and
the fear with me, my child,

01:10:00.828 --> 01:10:12.207
and you, yes, you, just
make sure to be free.

01:10:13.307 --> 01:10:16.511
Dare to follow your heart.

01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:21.283
And give me pride.

01:10:21.315 --> 01:10:23.618
That's all I ask of you.

01:10:27.488 --> 01:10:28.423
No, no, no.

01:10:34.529 --> 01:10:36.598
Father!
- Shush.

01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:37.700
Clarissa...

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:44.306
trust Alonzo.

01:10:44.639 --> 01:10:49.311
And now, my dear,
you must...

01:10:52.546 --> 01:10:55.483
fight for survival.

01:11:28.382 --> 01:11:29.717
Now load the pistol.

01:11:33.387 --> 01:11:34.855
I'm not minded
to do no killing.

01:11:34.889 --> 01:11:36.558
Load the pistol.

01:12:12.926 --> 01:12:14.562
Needs oil.

01:12:17.164 --> 01:12:18.499
Try the peacemaker.

01:12:40.988 --> 01:12:42.557
Now hold it firm.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:27.603
There's a coffin here,
and I'm gonna find it.

01:13:34.742 --> 01:13:35.644
Dig!

01:13:39.713 --> 01:13:43.951
You've gone all wrongheaded
since that woman got at you.

01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:45.486
 She'll be mine.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.590
Wrong, sweet
brother, she'll be his.

01:13:50.958 --> 01:13:53.994
Ain't nothing gonna fix that
mud fence ugly face of yours.

01:13:54.028 --> 01:13:56.565
You mean this
little critter here?

01:14:00.033 --> 01:14:01.469
Huh?

01:14:02.737 --> 01:14:03.672
Look at him.

01:14:03.704 --> 01:14:05.740
He can't tell skunks
from house cats, huh?

01:14:21.122 --> 01:14:23.725
What you looking at, huh?

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.565
What you looking at?

01:14:30.564 --> 01:14:33.534
De Sandoval.
- What'd you say?

01:14:33.568 --> 01:14:34.269
Huh?

01:14:34.301 --> 01:14:35.970
De Sandoval.

01:14:36.003 --> 01:14:37.772
What you say, boy?

01:14:39.774 --> 01:14:42.578
That's it right there,
that's the tree there.

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.912
That what you mean?

01:14:44.945 --> 01:14:46.747
We're supposed to
be digging there?

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.548
Is that what you mean?

01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:49.885
He says we should
be digging there!

01:15:19.113 --> 01:15:21.617
What you got there boy?

01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:23.819
 What is it?

01:15:28.756 --> 01:15:29.925
Son of a gun!

01:15:30.858 --> 01:15:32.027
Woo!

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.595
Yeehaw!
- What you got?

01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:35.029
It's down here, Reid!

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:35.998
 Come on.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.601
What is it?

01:15:40.601 --> 01:15:44.905
Affection for my
mind, spirit, and soul,

01:15:44.939 --> 01:15:45.908
be granted.

01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:49.544
Come on now, help
me get that lid off.

01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:14.835
Huh?

01:16:16.938 --> 01:16:17.839
Huh?

01:16:23.144 --> 01:16:25.080
It's just a bunch of damn crap!

01:16:37.992 --> 01:16:41.663
Now leave this town,
and tell those you meet

01:16:41.695 --> 01:16:43.798
there is no hidden
gold in Dry River.

01:16:44.798 --> 01:16:47.001
What are you gonna
do, Alonzo Murrieta?

01:16:48.703 --> 01:16:49.838
 We will
live our lives.

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:50.872
Without water?

01:16:52.939 --> 01:16:56.611
 I will ride
to Nogales, bring help.

01:16:57.278 --> 01:16:58.714
And then?

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:01.984
 I will
marry the woman I love.

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:07.856
Well, I say we hang him
from that there Apache pine.

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:14.129
Whisky just ain't
my temple.

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.673
Hold up, hold up.

01:17:27.007 --> 01:17:31.112
We will do this, but
we'll do it proper.

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:37.885
We gonna hang you where
the whole town can see you.

01:17:41.021 --> 01:17:44.191
Pack your war bags,
gather the horses,

01:17:44.225 --> 01:17:46.161
any water you can find.

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:47.963
We'll hang him in the morning.

01:17:48.796 --> 01:17:49.931
Then we'll ride on.

01:17:57.505 --> 01:17:58.940
Keep him pretty.

01:18:00.073 --> 01:18:02.977
You don't wanna spoil the
spectacle for the onlookers.

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.216
It ain't about
her no more, Mama.

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.318
Of course it is, son.

01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:12.286
It's about me.

01:18:12.319 --> 01:18:17.024
Our kin never did
like to feel humiliated.

01:18:18.091 --> 01:18:21.028
Go, tell her you love her.

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:28.003
I gave you a brain,
damn it, use it!

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:31.105
 Okay, Mama.

01:18:40.547 --> 01:18:43.017
You will have three days,

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:47.122
three days until your
skin starts to shrink,

01:18:48.355 --> 01:18:50.725
your blood starts to thicken,

01:18:51.826 --> 01:18:53.829
and your organs start bleeding.

01:19:00.067 --> 01:19:05.040
I like it when you're
thinking of me, Sheriff.

01:19:09.143 --> 01:19:14.115
Come the dawn, you will swing,
and that's a stiff fact.

01:19:14.148 --> 01:19:15.016
Yes, sir.

01:19:21.889 --> 01:19:22.991
Watch him, brother.

01:20:13.006 --> 01:20:13.941
Clarissa.

01:20:17.645 --> 01:20:19.114
I come to you unarmed.

01:20:22.216 --> 01:20:23.885
Then you made a mistake.

01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:26.187
I made a few, but
now I wanna make good.

01:20:31.057 --> 01:20:34.929
Then you'll turn around
and take me to Alonzo.

01:20:37.398 --> 01:20:40.435
You're gonna leave
here with me, princess.

01:20:40.467 --> 01:20:43.070
I'm offering you a
chance to start over.

01:20:44.204 --> 01:20:45.139
You're drunk.

01:20:46.239 --> 01:20:48.342
I'm asking for your hand.

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:52.113
I would rather die
than go with you.

01:20:56.984 --> 01:20:59.254
Just put the gun down
now, please, sweetie pie.

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:02.257
 Clarissa!

01:21:06.159 --> 01:21:07.227
Clarissa!

01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:15.035
 Pa!

01:21:21.408 --> 01:21:23.043
No, no, no, no.

01:21:34.087 --> 01:21:34.788
No!

01:21:50.203 --> 01:21:54.308
No, no.

01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:57.345
Daddy.

01:22:05.118 --> 01:22:06.119
No.

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.385
Step aside!

01:24:51.685 --> 01:24:55.223
Your weapons are no
match for our guns!

01:24:58.692 --> 01:25:00.361
Our fight is not with you.

01:25:02.296 --> 01:25:04.532
Lead us to Murrieta,
and we will ride on.

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:09.203
I'm right here, Cooper.

01:25:09.235 --> 01:25:14.141
Now, drop your
guns, do it slowly.

01:25:15.309 --> 01:25:17.245
You heard what
he said, cowboy.

01:25:26.953 --> 01:25:31.625
Is this what I get for
all the help I give you?

01:25:31.658 --> 01:25:34.495
Y'all know what's
been going on here,

01:25:35.729 --> 01:25:39.400
and, yet, look at ya.

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:44.505
Not one of you willing to
do what has to be done.

01:25:44.537 --> 01:25:46.406
The Lord's work!

01:25:47.774 --> 01:25:52.146
This town has been dealt
a great disservice,

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:57.152
a tremendous disservice
to town and country.

01:25:59.386 --> 01:26:05.493
I have worked tirelessly on
this lawless southern border

01:26:06.793 --> 01:26:11.165
to rebuild, to establish rules,

01:26:12.832 --> 01:26:19.273
to make you all more righteous
in the eyes of our Lord.

01:26:20.306 --> 01:26:25.445
And you, your blasphemous father

01:26:25.645 --> 01:26:27.481
got what he had coming to him.

01:26:28.448 --> 01:26:34.421
Neither he nor you possess
the guts to honor this land,

01:26:34.454 --> 01:26:36.590
and you call
yourself an American?

01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:42.330
Well, I got
something to tell ya.

01:26:44.331 --> 01:26:48.236
This town belongs in the Union.

01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:53.308
Warning has passed.

01:26:55.275 --> 01:26:58.445
This is Satan's
last stronghold.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:26:59.514
Enough!

01:27:00.847 --> 01:27:03.517
Now step down off that
horse, Etta Ryles.

01:27:04.451 --> 01:27:05.753
Real slow.

01:27:05.786 --> 01:27:07.455
You stay where you are, Ma.

01:27:08.855 --> 01:27:11.291
Ain't you glad we're leaving?

01:27:11.324 --> 01:27:13.026
Happy to have the town back?

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.429
You ain't leaving.

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:18.466
You gave up that right when
you murdered my father.

01:27:19.699 --> 01:27:21.334
Seems we can't agree none.

01:27:21.368 --> 01:27:25.240
Get off of that horse,
Etta, or Verne gets it first.

01:27:34.914 --> 01:27:36.516
I'm unarmed, son.

01:27:38.085 --> 01:27:42.723
Verne, Reid, drop your guns.

01:27:53.667 --> 01:27:54.769
Now you.

01:28:13.386 --> 01:28:14.688
Get off that horse.

01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:19.427
And make one false move,
and I'll blow your face off.

01:28:26.667 --> 01:28:28.669
Word is, Confederate
State Army are passing

01:28:28.702 --> 01:28:29.770
through here in five days.

01:28:29.802 --> 01:28:32.506
You'll be handed over to
them when they come through.

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.610
I'm taking my horse
and I'm riding on.

01:28:37.411 --> 01:28:39.347
That's right, ain't it, Sheriff?

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.316
Can't let you do that, Reid.

01:28:45.685 --> 01:28:47.788
What have you done, son?

01:28:53.827 --> 01:28:55.530
What have you done?

01:28:58.798 --> 01:29:00.467
 You ain't no family.

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:34.735
 Cooper!

01:30:13.539 --> 01:30:17.043
You will swing from that
noose either dead or alive!

01:30:54.981 --> 01:30:55.882
Come on, little prince.

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:58.819
You ain't nothing but
a little rowdydow.

01:32:23.069 --> 01:32:24.604
Cooper!

01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:28.842
Cooper!

01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:12.686
Cooper!

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:18.893
I'm done running.

01:33:21.261 --> 01:33:22.730
You brought this on
yourself, Clarissa.

01:33:22.762 --> 01:33:24.664
If you'd have just loved me,

01:33:24.698 --> 01:33:26.000
your father would
still be alive.

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:26.968
But he's in a better place now.

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:29.103
Where my father is
and where you're going

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:31.105
are two different places.

01:33:43.115 --> 01:33:44.884
You won't shoot me, Clarissa.

01:33:44.917 --> 01:33:47.621
I know you, your kindness
is your weakness.

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:51.626
Throw down.

01:33:52.158 --> 01:33:53.827
I told you, Clarissa.

01:33:55.261 --> 01:33:56.229
I'm done running.

01:33:56.262 --> 01:33:57.831
Yes, you are.

01:34:04.237 --> 01:34:06.874
Marry me in hell, Cooper Ryles.

01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:42.222
 Sand and
dust from old, heavenly books.

01:37:43.122 --> 01:37:49.996
Tales of fertile
lands, golden wheat,

01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:52.933
