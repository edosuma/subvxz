00:03.583 --> 00:06.208
(Franklin)
'Personal log, January 8, 2261.'

00:06.292 --> 00:08.250
'Dr. Stephen Franklin
recording.'

00:08.333 --> 00:10.250
'It's been nine days
since Captain Sheridan'

00:10.333 --> 00:12.333
was presumed killed
at Z'Ha'Dum.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.333
Nine days since Mr. Garibaldi

00:15.417 --> 00:17.583
disappeared on patrol
outside the station.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.125
'Medlab's quiet these days.'

00:23.500 --> 00:25.333
The League of Non-Aligned Worlds
has broken up

00:25.417 --> 00:27.292
and everyone's going back
to their homeworlds

00:27.375 --> 00:29.875
to prepare
for the next stage of war.

00:32.375 --> 00:34.458
We know the enemy's
gonna strike back.

00:36.250 --> 00:39.708
Rumor has it that this time
is gonna be the last time.

00:39.792 --> 00:41.792
This time they're gonna end it.

00:47.083 --> 00:49.125
All we can do now is

00:49.208 --> 00:50.958
wait for the other shoe
to drop

00:51.042 --> 00:54.333
or try and find something
useful to do before the end.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.625
And right now..

00:59.708 --> 01:02.958
...short of hand-holding
or a sympathetic ear..

01:04.417 --> 01:06.750
...I can't think
of one damn thing.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.625
Yes, Lennier?

01:12.708 --> 01:15.458
In coming to you, I'm committing
a breach of protocol.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.542
But you should know,
someone should know.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.625
There's a problem with Delenn.

01:23.208 --> 01:28.542
(Lorien)
Who are you? What do you want?
Who are you? What do you want?

01:28.625 --> 01:31.708
Who are you? Who are you?

01:49.417 --> 01:51.083
You were dreaming.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.625
Yes.

01:58.708 --> 02:00.000
About what?

02:05.917 --> 02:09.042
You're thinking about escape
again, aren't you?

02:09.125 --> 02:10.583
Don't.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.792
There's no way off Z'Ha'Dum.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.583
Might as well give up.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.292
Reconcile yourself as I did.

02:17.375 --> 02:20.333
First obligation of a prisoner
is to escape.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.458
Ah.

02:22.542 --> 02:26.250
So if one is a prisoner of love

02:26.333 --> 02:29.958
one must escape to solitude?

02:30.042 --> 02:34.708
If one is a prisoner to joy,
must one escape to sadness?

02:41.875 --> 02:45.500
I see you're still upset
that I won't tell you my name.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.417
'Well, what does it matter?'

02:49.875 --> 02:52.625
If I tell you
my name is Lorien..

02:53.542 --> 02:54.958
...what good is that?

02:55.042 --> 02:59.208
It tells you nothing,
but leaves me at a disadvantage.

02:59.292 --> 03:01.250
Words have meaning

03:01.333 --> 03:04.250
and names have power.

03:04.333 --> 03:07.625
The universe began
with a word, you know.

03:09.708 --> 03:12.667
But which came first.

03:12.750 --> 03:16.750
The word or the thought
behind the word?

03:18.167 --> 03:21.375
You can't create language
without thought.

03:21.458 --> 03:24.833
And you can't conceive
a thought without language.

03:24.917 --> 03:28.667
So which created the other..

03:28.750 --> 03:32.208
...and thus,
created the universe?

03:37.667 --> 03:40.792
[sighs]
No.

03:40.875 --> 03:44.333
I see you're far too wrapped up
in your question

03:44.417 --> 03:47.500
to consider the larger issues.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.250
What question?

03:49.333 --> 03:51.250
Who are you?

03:51.333 --> 03:53.375
How did you know about..

03:53.458 --> 03:56.250
It's a dangerous question,
isn't it?

03:56.333 --> 03:58.667
There's never
a good answer to it.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.708
I suppose that's the point.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.500
Now what you are?

04:05.583 --> 04:09.250
That's a question I can answer
at least in your case.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.458
You're dead.

04:12.542 --> 04:16.167
- Now that's enough.
- How long have you been here?

04:16.250 --> 04:17.792
I-I don't know.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.333
A day, maybe two.

04:19.417 --> 04:22.458
(Lorien)
'The sun has risen
and set nine times.'

04:22.542 --> 04:25.750
You haven't eaten.
You ought to be starving.

04:26.833 --> 04:30.042
'Are you hungry? Thirsty?'

04:30.125 --> 04:33.750
'Does blood still flow
through your veins?'

04:33.833 --> 04:34.917
Does it?

04:43.583 --> 04:45.208
There-there's no pulse.

04:45.292 --> 04:48.125
Because, my reluctant friend

04:48.208 --> 04:51.833
you are quite, quite dead.

05:01.292 --> 05:03.375
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.208
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

05:05.292 --> 05:07.917
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.917
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.250
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.875
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

05:13.958 --> 05:15.500
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.375
(Londo)
It was a new age.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.292
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

05:19.375 --> 05:22.083
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

05:24.542 --> 05:27.208
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

05:27.292 --> 05:30.667
(Sheridan)
The place, Babylon 5.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.208
[theme music]

06:00.792 --> 06:03.333
[music continues]

06:31.500 --> 06:33.833
Nothing to say about being dead?

06:33.917 --> 06:36.667
- It's a trick.
- Is it?

06:37.917 --> 06:39.625
What is the last thing
you remember

06:39.708 --> 06:42.167
before waking up here?

06:44.792 --> 06:47.042
(Sheridan)
I was falling.

06:49.083 --> 06:52.333
I fell a long way.

06:53.917 --> 06:56.542
It seemed to go on forever.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.000
Nothing goes on forever.

06:59.083 --> 07:02.792
Not falls, not you, not I

07:02.875 --> 07:05.583
not love, not life.

07:05.667 --> 07:08.875
Entropy consumes everything.

07:08.958 --> 07:13.208
We all hit bottom
sooner or later.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.292
Did you hit bottom?

07:19.583 --> 07:21.667
I-I don't remember.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.000
There are only
two possibilities.

07:24.083 --> 07:27.083
If you hit bottom,
then you are dead.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.958
If you did not hit bottom

07:30.042 --> 07:34.167
you are still falling
and all of this is a dream.

07:36.167 --> 07:39.958
Unless you're in between.

07:40.042 --> 07:44.125
- Between what?
- Between moments.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.625
When we are born

07:45.708 --> 07:48.417
we are allocated
a finite number of seconds.

07:48.500 --> 07:53.333
Each tick of the clock
slices off a piece of us.

07:53.417 --> 07:56.875
Tick.
A possibility for joy is gone.

07:56.958 --> 08:02.250
Tock. A careless word ends
one path, opens another.

08:02.333 --> 08:05.000
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.667
Always running out of time.

08:07.750 --> 08:11.167
Yours is almost used up.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.333
You're between seconds

08:13.417 --> 08:15.833
lost in the infinite
possibilities

08:15.917 --> 08:18.542
between tick and tock.

08:18.625 --> 08:21.042
Tick, you're alive.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.375
Tock..

08:23.708 --> 08:27.875
Well, it was a good life,
but a short one.

08:27.958 --> 08:31.417
Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick..

08:31.500 --> 08:33.875
How do I know you're not behind
all of this, huh?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.083
Just what are you up to?

08:37.167 --> 08:38.833
Who are you?

08:41.167 --> 08:44.833
(Lorien)
Who are you?
What do you want?

08:49.667 --> 08:52.000
'You're closer now, aren't you?'

08:53.208 --> 08:55.333
Yes, I see you are.

08:56.542 --> 09:00.500
'But closer to tick
or closer to tock?'

09:00.583 --> 09:02.458
I don't know.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.167
Only time will tell.

09:06.708 --> 09:10.958
And here between the moments..

09:11.042 --> 09:15.042
...we have all the time
in the world.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.167
[thunder rumbling]

09:26.250 --> 09:28.375
[indistinct chatter]

09:50.125 --> 09:51.792
You are Isaac?

09:54.750 --> 09:57.708
I was told you might be able
to give me some information.

09:57.792 --> 10:00.000
Maybe. It depends.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.708
This was part of a Starfury

10:02.792 --> 10:05.792
you sold to a trader
on Zafran 7.

10:05.875 --> 10:09.458
Could be. I don't remember
that particular piece.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.583
It's legal.
It was salvaged.

10:11.667 --> 10:15.333
Finders keepers,
losers buys them from finders.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.208
[laughing]

10:19.542 --> 10:23.583
I'm told you salvaged this
from an abandoned Starfury

10:23.667 --> 10:26.208
you found floating dead
in Sector 87.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.833
Is that correct?

10:29.708 --> 10:31.917
There's a partial serial number
on this piece.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.917
It matches the ID number
of a Starfury

10:34.000 --> 10:35.375
that belongs
to a friend of mine.

10:35.458 --> 10:38.333
His name is Michael Garibaldi.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.875
'He disappeared
almost two weeks ago.'

10:40.958 --> 10:42.125
'If this is from his ship--'

10:42.208 --> 10:43.833
I don't wanna talk
to you no more.

10:43.917 --> 10:46.125
A Starfury drifting
in the vastness of space

10:46.208 --> 10:49.333
is too small to run across
by accident.

10:49.417 --> 10:50.708
How did you know
where to find it?

10:50.792 --> 10:52.250
I said I got nothing
to say to you.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.750
- How did you know?
- I had a tip, okay?

10:56.250 --> 10:58.208
The man says he doesn't
wanna talk to you.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.042
Leave him alone.

11:02.208 --> 11:05.208
We're having
a private conversation.

11:05.292 --> 11:08.917
- It's no concern of yours.
- It's my bar.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.458
I'm making it my concern.

11:11.542 --> 11:13.167
'Now, get out.'

11:13.250 --> 11:15.125
I've come a long way.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.125
I intend to finish
my conversation.

11:18.208 --> 11:19.750
I don't think so.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.167
Such a negative personality.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.292
[grunts]

11:36.958 --> 11:38.833
[alarm blaring]

11:38.917 --> 11:40.333
Come on.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.458
Not now. They're gone.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.750
But find out
where they're staying.

11:51.875 --> 11:54.708
I might have something for you.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.292
[doorbell rings]

12:09.625 --> 12:10.833
Yes?

12:17.167 --> 12:18.958
Ambassador.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.167
Sorry for not answering at once.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.542
I was meditating.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.500
Is there a problem?

12:25.583 --> 12:27.792
Well, you tell me.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.417
I hear you haven't had
anything to eat or drink

12:29.500 --> 12:31.250
in almost seven days.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.917
Minbari can fast
as long as two weeks.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.792
A normal Minbari, yes.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.708
But you're partly human now.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.667
Your system can't handle
the stress you're putting on it.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.125
If you don't stop,
you're going to hurt yourself.

12:49.792 --> 12:53.292
Look, look, I-I know
this is how your people

12:53.375 --> 12:55.417
deal with grief, alright?
You fast.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.417
You purify yourselves
physically and spiritually.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.833
But nothing is
going to be served

12:59.917 --> 13:02.333
by endangering your own life.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.667
Justice is served.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.500
It is my fault
that John is gone.

13:06.583 --> 13:07.625
My fault that the Alliance

13:07.708 --> 13:09.167
against the Shadows
has crumbled.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.750
That the heart has
gone out of them.

13:10.833 --> 13:11.875
Delenn--

13:11.958 --> 13:13.292
For a long time

13:13.375 --> 13:15.583
I was afraid his wife might
still be alive on Z'Ha'Dum

13:15.667 --> 13:19.042
but I, I never asked.
I never told him.

13:19.125 --> 13:22.542
I denied him the right
to choose his actions wisely.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.708
I broke the trust between us.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.833
And when he learned
the truth on his own

13:27.917 --> 13:29.583
he didn't choose his actions.

13:29.667 --> 13:32.000
His actions chose him.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.958
And he went away.

13:36.042 --> 13:38.792
I have sometimes
heard humans say

13:38.875 --> 13:41.917
"Minbari never tell anyone
the whole truth."

13:43.833 --> 13:45.708
But I am no longer
wholly Minbari.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.167
I should have changed my heart
more than I did.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.042
But I, I loved him

13:50.125 --> 13:53.833
and I, I wanted to protect him.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.417
I should have loved him less
and trusted him more.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.917
Thank you for coming,
Stephen, but..

14:09.000 --> 14:11.083
...my fast will continue.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.833
If John does not return
from Z'Ha'Dum, if he's..

14:15.583 --> 14:17.542
If he's dead..

14:17.625 --> 14:21.250
...then my soul will join him
even if I cannot.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.375
And as I promised him long ago..

14:25.667 --> 14:27.833
...I will see him again

14:27.917 --> 14:30.208
in the place
where no Shadows fall.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.542
[instrumental music]

14:53.208 --> 14:55.125
Good thing I went out on my own.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.708
You're rather difficult to hide.

14:56.792 --> 14:59.667
- How is it outside?
- They're still looking for you.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.625
I don't think it would be safe
for you to leave for a while.

15:01.708 --> 15:04.458
Mm. Strange that they are
still after us.

15:04.542 --> 15:07.625
The altercation was a small one.
No one was harmed.

15:07.708 --> 15:09.792
- It doesn't make sense.
- You're right.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.708
That's the bit that worries me.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.542
If you're going to be worried
every time the universe

15:13.625 --> 15:15.292
doesn't make sense,
you're going to be worried

15:15.375 --> 15:18.083
every moment of every day for
the rest of your natural life.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.417
- Your point being?
- My point being..

15:21.583 --> 15:23.375
Why am I talking to you?

15:23.458 --> 15:25.667
And what are you doing here?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.583
I heard you were
looking for Mr. Garibaldi

15:27.667 --> 15:29.917
on the assumption
he was in trouble.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.333
So I went looking for you

15:31.417 --> 15:34.042
on the assumption
you'd probably get into trouble.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.667
I was doing fine
until you showed up

15:36.750 --> 15:38.542
with that thing in hand.

15:38.625 --> 15:41.333
It's a Minbari fighting pike
several hundred years old.

15:41.417 --> 15:44.167
You're just jealous
because you don't have one.

15:44.250 --> 15:47.083
Bad case of pikal envy
if you ask me.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.000
So you think you have
a lead on Mr. Garibaldi?

15:51.083 --> 15:52.917
If that was his Starfury
they found

15:53.000 --> 15:55.375
then he may have escaped
or been intercepted.

15:55.458 --> 15:56.625
I'll go back later and..

15:56.708 --> 15:58.250
[footsteps]

16:02.833 --> 16:05.750
I think it would be better
if you let me do it.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.500
They seem rather eager
to find you.

16:07.583 --> 16:10.333
- Eagerness like that--
- Worries you.

16:11.958 --> 16:15.208
Hell, I suppose I should
appreciate your concern.

16:15.292 --> 16:19.208
Compassion is a rare
commodity these days.

16:19.292 --> 16:21.833
So why are you doing this?

16:24.500 --> 16:25.750
He's my friend.

16:27.125 --> 16:30.875
I've never had a friend
before who wasn't a Narn.

16:30.958 --> 16:32.208
And you?

16:33.542 --> 16:36.167
I've never had a friend
before who was a Narn.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.958
Damn few of any other kind.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.958
Most of them are dead.

16:48.417 --> 16:49.792
(G'Kar)
May I?

17:03.042 --> 17:04.708
To open it, you press..

17:08.333 --> 17:09.542
I like it.

17:10.583 --> 17:11.750
(male #1)
'No.'

17:12.917 --> 17:14.083
No.

17:15.042 --> 17:17.250
Close, but too tall.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.958
You're sure it was a Narn?

17:19.042 --> 17:21.000
What, did I suddenly
become stupid overnight?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.250
Of course, it was a Narn.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.875
It's not like
they're easy to miss.

17:23.958 --> 17:25.250
No.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.542
No.

17:29.375 --> 17:32.333
That's him. That's the one.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.000
Citizen G'Kar.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.667
The last of the Kha'Ri
still free.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.333
There's a reward
for his capture

17:42.417 --> 17:44.417
dead or alive.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.083
Yeah?

17:46.167 --> 17:48.333
Which pays the most?

17:59.083 --> 18:00.750
Wakey wakey.

18:00.833 --> 18:03.542
'I'm here with your
weather report for the evening.'

18:03.625 --> 18:05.500
I see rain

18:05.583 --> 18:07.667
lightning, thunder

18:07.750 --> 18:10.875
and your head nailed
to that wall over there

18:10.958 --> 18:13.875
if you don't tell me what
my friend and I need to know.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.125
Any questions?

18:19.792 --> 18:22.292
[instrumental music]

18:33.208 --> 18:36.208
- You wanted to see me.
- Yes.

18:36.292 --> 18:38.958
Ivanova wanted me to go through
the captain's personal effects

18:39.042 --> 18:42.750
and figure out what to keep
and what to store.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.458
What to, uh, send back
to his family.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.792
She, uh, gave me the password

18:49.875 --> 18:55.000
to his personal log
and other official files.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.708
I was looking through them
when I found this.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.667
I thought you might like
to take a look at that.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.875
I'll be outside
when you're through.

19:21.667 --> 19:25.292
Personal log, May 14, 2260.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.417
We actually
had a quiet day today.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.667
'It's hard to believe
with so much going on lately.'

19:33.750 --> 19:35.917
'And now that we've
broken away from Earth'

19:36.000 --> 19:38.042
'everything has hit the fan.'

19:38.958 --> 19:40.958
It's not what I wanted.

19:42.292 --> 19:44.167
Frankly, it scares
the hell out of me.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.083
But it had to be done.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.875
The job now is to

19:49.958 --> 19:53.375
turn this around and make it
into something positive.

19:55.208 --> 19:58.542
My dad always told me that's
the only way you deal with pain.

19:59.667 --> 20:03.083
You don't surrender.
You don't fight it.

20:03.167 --> 20:05.417
'You turn it
into something positive.'

20:07.167 --> 20:08.750
He used to say

20:08.833 --> 20:12.000
"If you're falling off a cliff,
you may as well try to fly.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.375
You've got nothing to lose."

20:16.917 --> 20:18.250
In a way..

20:21.125 --> 20:23.250
...I feel the same way
about Delenn.

20:24.958 --> 20:27.792
'I mean, During the war,
I, I fought Minbari.'

20:27.875 --> 20:30.208
'I killed Minbari.'

20:30.292 --> 20:33.042
'Saw many of my friends
die at Minbari hands.'

20:34.875 --> 20:35.958
Here I am..

20:37.167 --> 20:39.333
...in love with one of them.

20:41.375 --> 20:44.542
For a long time, I thought about
not saying anything, but..

20:46.000 --> 20:49.458
...the moment my heart
crossed that line

20:49.542 --> 20:52.500
there wasn't much I could do
but see it through.

20:54.417 --> 20:57.625
'Yeah, I've, I've fallen off
one hell of a cliff.'

21:00.333 --> 21:02.708
When I look in her eyes..

21:06.000 --> 21:10.375
...I let myself think
maybe I really can fly.

21:16.958 --> 21:19.042
And according
to our newfound friend

21:19.125 --> 21:21.875
he was given the location
of Mr. Garibaldi's Starfury

21:21.958 --> 21:25.458
by someone from
Interplanetary Expeditions.

21:25.542 --> 21:28.708
His contact would get ten
percent of the salvage price.

21:28.792 --> 21:30.167
Did you get a name?

21:30.250 --> 21:32.500
Montagne. That's all he had.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.250
So what's our next step?

21:36.333 --> 21:38.125
After I get some sleep

21:38.208 --> 21:41.083
I'll go back to the place
where his ship was found.

21:41.167 --> 21:44.000
It's possible I may find
more information.

21:44.083 --> 21:46.208
You should go back
to Babylon 5 to--

21:46.292 --> 21:48.875
No, I'm staying here with you.

21:48.958 --> 21:50.375
Marcus, if you stay here

21:50.458 --> 21:53.833
we'll never find out who
and where this Montagne is.

21:53.917 --> 21:56.458
We need Babylon 5's
resources for that.

21:56.542 --> 21:58.500
I'd rather not leave
until I know you're--

21:58.583 --> 21:59.875
Marcus.

22:01.375 --> 22:04.000
I am the last of the Kha'Ri.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.625
I fought in our war
of liberation

22:05.708 --> 22:06.792
against the Centauri.

22:06.875 --> 22:08.958
I can take care of myself.

22:09.042 --> 22:11.875
If you stay,
I will be deeply offended.

22:11.958 --> 22:14.292
And there is little more
inherently dangerous

22:14.375 --> 22:15.458
than an offended Narn.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.583
G'Kar--

22:16.667 --> 22:19.083
This is
a personal mission for me.

22:19.167 --> 22:22.250
And I must pursue it alone
wherever that takes me.

22:22.333 --> 22:27.125
I need Babylon 5's resources
more than I need the company

22:27.208 --> 22:28.917
however pleasant.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.208
Alright.

22:34.667 --> 22:35.625
Get some sleep.

22:35.708 --> 22:36.958
I'll send word
if I find anything.

22:37.042 --> 22:38.500
Thank you.

22:43.042 --> 22:45.583
[exhales]

22:54.167 --> 22:56.625
[instrumental music]

23:00.917 --> 23:03.792
[footsteps]

23:24.208 --> 23:26.667
[music continues]

23:34.125 --> 23:35.458
[explosion]

23:35.542 --> 23:36.750
[gunfire]

23:42.458 --> 23:44.167
[groans]

23:55.417 --> 23:57.333
[instrumental music]

24:04.958 --> 24:06.542
(Delenn)
Thank you all for coming.

24:06.625 --> 24:08.833
From their beginnings,
a 1000 years ago

24:08.917 --> 24:11.208
when they were
first created by Valen

24:11.292 --> 24:14.458
the Rangers have always been
our first line of defense

24:14.542 --> 24:16.333
against the Shadows.

24:16.417 --> 24:18.917
Many of you have been
working in dark places.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.750
Your names and your work
unknown to anyone outside.

24:22.833 --> 24:27.250
I hold before you a chance
to shine in the night

24:27.333 --> 24:29.333
to strike one last blow

24:29.417 --> 24:31.042
that will be heard
and remembered

24:31.125 --> 24:33.375
a thousand years from now.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.875
The League of Non-Aligned Worlds
has collapsed

24:35.958 --> 24:39.042
but there are a few among them
who still believe in our cause.

24:39.125 --> 24:40.708
Who would prefer
to go down fighting

24:40.792 --> 24:42.375
if that is to be our destiny.

24:42.458 --> 24:45.000
'They need only
a single rallying cry.'

24:45.083 --> 24:48.208
(Delenn)
'I call upon you, upon
the entire White Star fleet'

24:48.292 --> 24:49.917
'to be that voice.'

24:50.000 --> 24:51.208
If the others are afraid

24:51.292 --> 24:53.042
then we will show them
what must be done.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.708
And if our deaths are required

24:54.792 --> 24:57.083
they will at least
light the way.

24:57.167 --> 24:59.708
We will attack Z'Ha'Dum.

24:59.792 --> 25:02.333
[indistinct murmuring]

25:02.417 --> 25:04.292
(Delenn)
'The plan is to wait
seven more days'

25:04.375 --> 25:07.250
so that any ships that wish
to join us can arrive.

25:07.333 --> 25:11.750
Then with darkness before us
and destruction behind

25:11.833 --> 25:13.375
we will strike.

25:14.417 --> 25:17.000
Our chances of success
are small.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.250
But if we stay here
and do nothing

25:19.333 --> 25:21.083
they're even smaller.

25:21.167 --> 25:22.917
So we go.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
As a dear friend said to me

25:25.083 --> 25:27.708
"If you're falling
off a mountain

25:27.792 --> 25:29.958
you may as well try to fly."

25:30.875 --> 25:32.875
Here, at the end

25:32.958 --> 25:37.167
I offer you
one final chance to fly.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.792
[knock on door]

25:42.875 --> 25:44.500
What is it?

25:44.583 --> 25:47.125
[knock on door]

25:47.208 --> 25:49.417
What? What is it?

25:51.875 --> 25:53.333
Just a moment.

25:56.792 --> 25:58.875
[knock on door]

26:04.125 --> 26:07.333
- Oh, Mollari.
- Do you know what time it is?

26:07.417 --> 26:10.125
Yes, but the emperor
was most insistent.

26:10.208 --> 26:13.333
He says you must come
this moment.

26:13.417 --> 26:14.458
Why?

26:14.542 --> 26:17.208
He does not reveal
his mind to me

26:17.292 --> 26:19.292
only his intentions.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.000
Please, hurry.

26:21.083 --> 26:22.583
Alright. Give me a moment.

26:22.667 --> 26:23.917
Oh, no, uh..

26:28.667 --> 26:31.333
(Emperor Cartagia)
Yes, yes, later. Go.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.667
Mollari, you've kept us waiting.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.042
I should be very upset with you.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.208
My apologies.

26:39.292 --> 26:41.000
Before I entered
Your Majesty's presence

26:41.083 --> 26:43.375
I had to be properly attired

26:43.458 --> 26:45.333
or it would be disrespectful.

26:45.417 --> 26:47.167
I see.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.667
Then I should not
have you killed for it?

26:51.167 --> 26:54.167
Your Majesty may act
as he believes is correct

26:54.250 --> 26:58.833
but I was motivated only
by the respect to your position.

26:58.917 --> 27:02.333
I had Your Majesty's spirit
in my heart.

27:02.417 --> 27:04.750
And so by killing me,
you would also be killing

27:04.833 --> 27:06.333
a part of yourself.

27:06.417 --> 27:10.250
And as a loyal Centauri

27:10.333 --> 27:12.667
I would strongly object to that.

27:13.625 --> 27:14.500
Well said.

27:14.583 --> 27:16.583
Well said. I like you.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.792
I like you a great deal.
Did you know that?

27:18.875 --> 27:21.833
I feel we have
so much in common.

27:21.917 --> 27:25.792
Which is why I have
secured you a gift.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.417
- A gift?
- A gift.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.333
I wanted you to see it
as soon as it arrived.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.708
But it is unnecessary
for you to--

27:32.792 --> 27:34.875
Nonsense!

27:34.958 --> 27:37.708
No one turns down
one of my gifts.

27:37.792 --> 27:40.125
Besides,
I know you'll like this one.

27:40.208 --> 27:44.667
It's something you've wanted
for a long, long time.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.708
Would you like to
see your gift now?

27:47.792 --> 27:49.875
- Yes, Majesty.
- Good!

27:51.000 --> 27:52.708
[bell chimes]

27:58.833 --> 28:00.875
[chains rattling]

28:12.875 --> 28:16.125
(Emperor Cartagia)
'There he is,
the last of the Kha'Ri.'

28:16.208 --> 28:19.042
'I know he's been
a great burden to you.'

28:19.125 --> 28:20.958
'But now he's here
for our amusement.'

28:21.042 --> 28:24.417
'And, well, when he ceases
to be amusing, mm..'

28:26.542 --> 28:27.500
Ah?

28:27.583 --> 28:29.250
[laughs]

28:29.333 --> 28:32.208
Oh, Mollari,
have you nothing to say?

28:34.875 --> 28:36.583
Yes, Majesty.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.542
Thank you.

28:38.625 --> 28:40.417
Thank you for this..

28:42.708 --> 28:44.083
...gift.

28:51.833 --> 28:53.667
And you.

28:54.542 --> 28:57.417
Have you anything to say?

28:57.500 --> 29:01.167
Do you, by any chance,
happen to know

29:01.250 --> 29:04.042
where Mr. Garibaldi might be?

29:09.417 --> 29:10.708
Who?

29:13.250 --> 29:15.292
[grunting]

29:23.583 --> 29:25.708
(man on speaker)
'Please restrain yourself,
Mr. Garibaldi'

29:25.792 --> 29:28.417
'or you will hurt yourself.
We can't allow that.'

29:28.500 --> 29:30.208
Yeah, why not?

29:30.292 --> 29:32.542
- 'We have orders.'
- Orders? Whose orders?

29:32.625 --> 29:34.083
Orders? Whose orders?
Whose orders?

29:34.167 --> 29:35.500
(man on speaker)
'We can't tell you that.'

29:35.583 --> 29:36.958
'You must know that by now.'

29:37.042 --> 29:39.708
Look, just,
what do you want from me?

29:39.792 --> 29:41.292
(man on speaker)
'We want to know
what you remember'

29:41.375 --> 29:45.000
'after you were taken
from Babylon 5.'

29:45.083 --> 29:47.333
I told you,
I don't remember anything.

29:47.417 --> 29:48.875
(man on speaker)
'Your vital signs indicate'

29:48.958 --> 29:51.042
'you're being somewhat
less than honest.'

29:51.125 --> 29:52.750
'You're just trying
to avoid discomfort'

29:52.833 --> 29:54.792
'by telling us what you think
we want to hear.'

29:54.875 --> 29:56.167
And why would I do that, huh?

29:56.250 --> 29:58.042
Maybe because you got me
stuck in this tomb.

29:58.125 --> 29:59.458
I don't know
where the hell I'm at.

29:59.542 --> 30:01.542
Maybe figuring out what you want
is the only way out.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.500
- Well, silly me.
- 'Don't think, Mr. Garibaldi.'

30:04.583 --> 30:06.458
(man on speaker)
'Don't think, Mr. Garibaldi.'

30:06.542 --> 30:08.625
- 'Just tell us the truth.'
- Oh, give me a break.

30:08.708 --> 30:10.375
(man on speaker)
'What happened
after you left Babylon 5?

30:10.458 --> 30:11.917
I told you I don't remember.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.417
- 'What happened after--'
- I said I don't remember.

30:14.500 --> 30:18.792

'What happened? What happened?
Stop that, Mr. Garibaldi.'

30:20.792 --> 30:24.708

[coughs]

31:00.667 --> 31:02.083
Hello.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.292
Hello, G'Kar.

31:16.250 --> 31:19.042
You were foolish to leave
Babylon 5, you know.

31:19.125 --> 31:21.125
You had sanctuary there.

31:21.208 --> 31:24.417
As soon as you left,
you were vulnerable.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.083
If you wished to die,
you could have simply told me.

31:30.167 --> 31:32.750
I would have attended
to it quickly.

31:35.458 --> 31:39.375
With at least a,
a measure of dignity.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.625
But here..

31:48.667 --> 31:50.167
Here..

31:53.250 --> 31:55.375
...they will make you a toy.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.292
You will be tortured.

32:00.583 --> 32:02.708
You will be tortured
for a very long time.

32:02.792 --> 32:06.917
I have seen them prolong
suffering for days..

32:08.542 --> 32:12.583
...weeks...months.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.833
And when they have finished

32:17.917 --> 32:21.167
they will strap you to a table.

32:21.250 --> 32:24.167
Not much longer than this bench.

32:26.083 --> 32:29.167
And they will make
an incision here

32:29.250 --> 32:31.000
just beneath the neck..

32:32.250 --> 32:35.000
...and open you..

32:36.583 --> 32:38.708
...all the way down.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.875
'Assuming you are
still conscious'

32:42.958 --> 32:45.542

32:45.625 --> 32:48.542
they will begin removing
your internal organs..

32:49.958 --> 32:51.542
...in pieces..

32:52.833 --> 32:55.000
...no longer than this.

32:57.708 --> 33:00.750
Somewhere along the line..

33:00.833 --> 33:04.000
...as they make a mountain
of your parts and pieces..

33:05.625 --> 33:07.500
...you will die.

33:08.708 --> 33:10.958
And does this please you?

33:13.167 --> 33:14.500
No.

33:14.583 --> 33:15.875
No, it doesn't.

33:18.542 --> 33:21.083
Once, long ago..

33:24.667 --> 33:26.625
No, not even then.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.083
You have never been
a friend to me

33:31.167 --> 33:34.042
but what he would do to you..

33:34.125 --> 33:36.458
...I would not wish for anyone.

33:45.833 --> 33:50.417
There is a monster
on the throne, G'Kar.

33:51.667 --> 33:53.958
A well-protected monster.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.917
He must be removed.

33:58.167 --> 34:02.667
And you may be the means
I have been waiting for.

34:06.292 --> 34:09.125
I believe I can save your life

34:09.208 --> 34:11.208
but it will not be easy.

34:11.292 --> 34:14.500
And you will suffer greatly
before this is over.

34:16.167 --> 34:18.542
I cannot help that.
I wish I could.

34:20.042 --> 34:22.542
I have no desire
to see you suffer.

34:24.042 --> 34:27.875
But...I must watch.

34:29.625 --> 34:33.375
And you must endure
until the time is right.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.542
And then I will act.

34:37.417 --> 34:39.417
And you will help me.

34:41.125 --> 34:42.708
'Yes?'

34:52.583 --> 34:54.667
You didn't ask the price..

34:55.667 --> 34:57.542
...for my cooperation.

35:01.083 --> 35:04.333
You are not exactly
in a position to bargain, G'Kar.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.083
Neither are you.

35:10.083 --> 35:11.667
You want my help..

35:12.750 --> 35:14.750
...for the sake of your people.

35:16.417 --> 35:20.542
I will give it
for the sake of my own.

35:22.708 --> 35:26.542
If I remove the monster
from your throne..

35:28.750 --> 35:33.292
...you will remove the monster
from my world.

35:34.750 --> 35:37.000
Leave Narn.

35:38.125 --> 35:40.625
Set my world free.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.000
Promise me this.

35:45.792 --> 35:48.000
And I will do as you ask.

35:53.708 --> 35:55.792
You have my word.

36:12.833 --> 36:15.375
[instrumental music]

36:15.458 --> 36:18.875
This is the fire I set
when I woke up down here.

36:22.208 --> 36:24.250
I've come full circle.

36:24.333 --> 36:25.917
Don't we all?

36:27.167 --> 36:29.000
Look.

36:29.083 --> 36:30.917
You've been down here
longer than I have.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.250
Oh, much, much longer.

36:32.333 --> 36:34.208
Well, there must be
some way out of here.

36:34.292 --> 36:38.250
Tick, you're alive.
Tock, you're dead.

36:38.333 --> 36:41.417
The only way out
is to surrender to tock.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.750
No.

36:44.083 --> 36:46.750
No, I can't do that.
Don't you understand?

36:48.167 --> 36:50.583
There's a war on out there.

36:50.667 --> 36:51.917
If we don't do something

36:52.000 --> 36:53.083
billions of people
are going to die.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.792
Now don't you care about that?

36:54.875 --> 36:57.458
Yes, of course, I care.

36:57.542 --> 37:01.167
It's a terrible thing
when your children fight.

37:01.250 --> 37:04.292
I warned the others,
but they didn't listen.

37:04.375 --> 37:05.958
They never listen.

37:06.042 --> 37:08.958
Your children?

37:09.042 --> 37:11.125
Metaphorically speaking.

37:11.208 --> 37:13.125
Those who came after me.

37:13.208 --> 37:15.750
Children. Younger siblings.

37:16.875 --> 37:19.250
How long have you been here?

37:19.333 --> 37:21.042
A long time.

37:22.625 --> 37:24.208
So long.

37:26.208 --> 37:29.625
I was old when the molecules
of your world joined

37:29.708 --> 37:35.417
and called themselves land
and sea and fish and man.

37:36.958 --> 37:39.417
You're one of the first ones.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.917
No.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.083
Not one of the first ones.

37:44.292 --> 37:47.875
I am...the first one.

37:57.208 --> 38:01.542
You know a way
out of here, don't you?

38:01.625 --> 38:03.708
Perhaps.

38:03.792 --> 38:06.208
Then why are you still here?

38:06.292 --> 38:08.833
- I'm waiting.
- For what?

38:09.667 --> 38:12.500
Someone to talk to.

38:12.583 --> 38:15.958
You're the first
to make it this far.

38:19.208 --> 38:21.042
Do they know?

38:21.125 --> 38:23.083
Of course.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.875
That's why they come back
to Z'Ha'Dum

38:24.958 --> 38:26.875
every time they're driven off.

38:26.958 --> 38:29.167
Because I'm here.

38:29.250 --> 38:32.208
They think
they're showing respect.

38:32.292 --> 38:34.542
They don't understand.

38:34.625 --> 38:36.333
They used to

38:36.417 --> 38:39.083
but that was a long time ago.

38:39.167 --> 38:41.250
A million years.

38:41.333 --> 38:43.500
You don't look a..

38:44.458 --> 38:46.250
No, I don't.

38:46.333 --> 38:48.833
Well, not at the moment.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.750
(Lorien)
Who are you?

38:54.708 --> 38:57.250
That was you.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.667
Perhaps.

38:58.750 --> 39:02.125
We all have secrets
and surprises.

39:04.208 --> 39:07.583
Did you know you have
a Vorlon inside you?

39:07.667 --> 39:09.667
'Well, a piece of one.'

39:11.167 --> 39:15.583
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'Ha'Dum,
you will die.

39:15.667 --> 39:16.833
Jump.

39:16.917 --> 39:18.750
Jump now.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.375
- Kosh.
- Is that its name?

39:25.458 --> 39:27.667
I think I met it once long ago.

39:28.833 --> 39:30.875
He told me to jump.

39:33.042 --> 39:35.833
- Did he know?
- 'That I was here?'

39:37.167 --> 39:38.792
Almost certainly.

39:39.583 --> 39:41.208
How did..

(Lorien)
'They can break off pieces
of their consciousness'

39:44.375 --> 39:46.500
'and put it
into other organisms.'

39:46.583 --> 39:49.625
It allows them to travel
hidden through the galaxy

39:49.708 --> 39:51.875
using others
as their eyes and ears.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.667
Kosh is in you

39:55.750 --> 39:58.125
and he's part of the problem.

39:58.208 --> 39:59.958
'You're the other part.'

40:00.042 --> 40:02.542
'You're both still
clinging to life.'

40:02.625 --> 40:04.542
'Both afraid to let go.'

40:06.333 --> 40:08.958
You must lay down
the burden of life

40:09.042 --> 40:10.292
both of you

40:10.375 --> 40:13.208
and surrender yourself to tock.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.500
No, I can't.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.458
The others need me.

40:21.542 --> 40:24.333
You can't turn away from death
simply because you're afraid

40:24.417 --> 40:26.208
of what might happen
without you.

40:26.292 --> 40:28.625
That's not enough.

40:28.708 --> 40:31.833
You're not embracing life.
You're fleeing death.

40:31.917 --> 40:34.708
And so you're caught
in between

40:34.792 --> 40:36.917
'unable to go forward
or backward.'

40:38.208 --> 40:40.208
Your friends need
what you can be

40:40.292 --> 40:42.750
when you are no longer afraid.

40:42.833 --> 40:45.792
When you know who you are
and why you are

40:45.875 --> 40:47.625
and what you want.

40:47.708 --> 40:51.500
'When you are no longer
looking for reasons to live'

40:51.583 --> 40:53.875
'but can simply be.'

40:57.167 --> 40:59.000
I can't.

40:59.083 --> 41:01.958
I don't know how to do that.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.292
Then I cannot help you.

41:04.375 --> 41:07.500
And you will be caught
forever in between.

41:09.958 --> 41:12.000

the death of fear.

41:22.125 --> 41:24.917
Step into the abyss..

41:25.958 --> 41:27.750
...and let go.

41:31.542 --> 41:33.333
It's getting darker.

41:34.167 --> 41:36.208
I know.

41:36.292 --> 41:38.167
You're close, friend.

41:38.250 --> 41:40.542
Very close.

41:40.625 --> 41:45.250
It's easy to find
something worth dying for.

41:45.333 --> 41:48.042
Do you have anything
worth living for?

How will I know
if you'll catch me?

42:01.625 --> 42:03.750
(Lorien)
'I caught you before.'
