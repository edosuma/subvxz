DNA from a kid that's been missing
20 years turns up at a crime scene.

00:05.070 --> 00:06.470
Mark, it's Jesse.

00:06.630 --> 00:08.310
- Dad, he didn't do it.
- He admitted to it.

00:08.470 --> 00:11.430
- I want you to talk about my brother.
- Who else is lying about that day?

00:11.590 --> 00:13.430
Are you, are your friends?

00:13.590 --> 00:15.830
There was another man
and he was gentle.

00:15.990 --> 00:18.310
They're saying cause your dad
led the initial investigation,

00:18.470 --> 00:20.350
<i>maybe you're out to prove something.</i>

00:21.670 --> 00:24.110
Don't mention Jesse's DNA
being found on Newman's shirt.

00:24.270 --> 00:26.950
- I don't need telling.
- <i>Is that the murder victim?</i>

00:27.110 --> 00:28.790
<i>We think she's possibly a prostitute.</i>

00:28.950 --> 00:30.350
I promise to make amends.

00:30.510 --> 00:32.750
Geography teacher called Mr Marshall
or Mr Kenton Marshall?

00:32.910 --> 00:34.030
Are you a policeman?

00:34.190 --> 00:35.550
<i>I married the wrong man.</i>

00:37.750 --> 00:38.590
I helped him.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.110
I've got to put my hands up
and face what I did.

00:47.270 --> 00:48.830
<i>♪ Who broke my heart? ♪</i>

00:48.990 --> 00:51.630
<i>♪ You did, you did
Bow to the target ♪</i>

00:51.790 --> 00:53.630
Know what fascinates me
about this song?

00:53.790 --> 00:55.470
The bit where he says:

00:55.630 --> 00:58.750
<i>♪ I thought you loved me
but it seems like you don't care ♪</i>

00:58.910 --> 01:00.790
And she's all, like...

01:00.950 --> 01:03.390
"I care enough to know
that I could never love you."

01:03.550 --> 01:05.030
A cheesy line some guy would say.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.590
- What the hell does that mean?
- It's romantic.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.910
Cause she says she cares enough
to know that she'll never love him.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.390
But what does that mean?

01:12.550 --> 01:15.630
She's softening the blow.
She doesn't really care for him at all.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.950
Right, but earlier,
he's insulting her.

01:18.110 --> 01:21.390
He's saying, "You think you're smart.
Stupid, stupid."

01:21.550 --> 01:23.590
No, no, he's not calling her stupid.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.550
It sounds like it. "You think
you're smart. Stupid, stupid."

01:27.710 --> 01:30.670
He says "Right from the start
when you knew we would part".

01:30.830 --> 01:33.990
So she's too good for him.
And they both know it.

01:34.150 --> 01:35.150
Yeah.

01:35.310 --> 01:36.790
What he said!

01:38.750 --> 01:41.110
He's going along with her
because she's fit.

01:41.270 --> 01:43.950
You know, she's hot,
she's sexy, she's gorgeous.

01:44.110 --> 01:47.190
He knows it's not gonna work
but the sex is fantastic.

01:47.350 --> 01:50.590
And in the end, she cares enough
to know she can never love him?

01:50.750 --> 01:51.990
Got it.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074

04:14.110 --> 04:15.710
Brit?

06:08.550 --> 06:10.550
- Mark?
- Aye. Mm!

06:10.710 --> 06:13.110
Mark, I've got to go.
What am I doing here?

06:13.270 --> 06:15.630
I've got no memory
of anything after the bar.

06:15.790 --> 06:19.190
Well, we came back here
and we drank a lot.

06:19.350 --> 06:20.510
And then...

06:21.950 --> 06:23.390
I just put you to bed.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.910
Did anything happen?

06:25.070 --> 06:26.630
I had a quick look down your top.

06:26.790 --> 06:28.030
- Other than that...
- Oh, my God.

06:28.190 --> 06:31.150
I've really got to go!
Please can you drive me home?

06:31.310 --> 06:34.310
No way, not in this state.
I'll call you a cab.

06:35.630 --> 06:38.030
God, what am I gonna tell him?

06:38.510 --> 06:40.590
I don't dare turn my phone on.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.750
Please! Mark, please help me!

06:42.910 --> 06:44.710
All right. Jesus.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.150
Morning.

06:52.230 --> 06:55.350
No explanations necessary,
you're both consenting adults.

06:55.510 --> 06:57.750
- Will you drive me home?
- Yeah.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.150
Bye.

06:59.750 --> 07:00.990
Come on.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.390
Dad.

07:32.070 --> 07:33.590
All right...

07:50.910 --> 07:52.830
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

07:54.710 --> 07:56.950
What is wrong with you?

08:05.030 --> 08:06.590
Watch your head.

08:18.750 --> 08:19.830
Hi.

08:19.990 --> 08:22.550
- Mummy!
- Hi, gorgeous.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.350
Hi, darling.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.990
Daddy says you've been
on a sleepover.

08:31.230 --> 08:32.750
That's right.

08:32.909 --> 08:34.470
Did you have a midnight feast?

08:34.630 --> 08:38.030
Absolutely. You've got to have
a midnight feast on a sleepover.

08:38.190 --> 08:39.789
Which friend did you stay with?

08:42.750 --> 08:43.909
Erm...

08:45.550 --> 08:47.710
You don't really know them, darling.

08:49.870 --> 08:52.030
- Oh, can I have some of your cereal?
- Yeah.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.750
Thank you.

08:54.990 --> 08:57.430
- Did you sleep with him?
- No.

08:57.590 --> 08:59.310
- Did you want to?
- No!

08:59.950 --> 09:02.110
So why end up at his place?

09:02.270 --> 09:03.990
Erm...

09:04.590 --> 09:06.270
I was pissed.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.510
I drank on an empty stomach, Stuart.
He was being nice.

09:10.670 --> 09:11.910
Bullshit!

09:12.070 --> 09:14.590
Nice is bringing you home,
nice is calling you a cab.

09:14.750 --> 09:16.030
Not taking you back to his place

09:16.190 --> 09:18.430
and trying to stick his tongue
down your throat!

09:18.590 --> 09:20.270
That didn't happen.

09:21.390 --> 09:23.510
I'm sorry, Stuart, I messed up, OK?

09:23.670 --> 09:25.470
But if you want grovelling, then...

09:25.630 --> 09:27.670
- Grovelling?
- I texted you!

09:27.830 --> 09:29.070
I texted you in the pub.

09:29.230 --> 09:32.150
I told you we were having drinks
and I might be late.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.030
When I called, your phone was off.

09:34.190 --> 09:36.030
What am I supposed to think
about that?

09:36.190 --> 09:37.470
I'm laying in bed awake.

09:37.630 --> 09:40.430
Hours passing by
and still you're not here.

09:40.590 --> 09:42.750
- I called the hospitals.
- You called the hospitals?

09:42.910 --> 09:44.350
When do you ever not come home?

09:44.510 --> 09:47.070
I thought something
had happened to you.

09:47.230 --> 09:49.670
But by five in the morning, I knew.

09:49.830 --> 09:52.390
I knew you were somewhere
you shouldn't be.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.790
I mean, an ex-boyfriend, Pru.

09:55.950 --> 09:57.910
What am I supposed to feel
about that, huh?

09:58.950 --> 10:01.230
Put the shoe on the other foot
for a second.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.390
I'm sorry.

10:08.870 --> 10:10.310
I messed up.

10:12.630 --> 10:15.590
But for one night,
the old Pru reared her head.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.350
And it felt good.

10:17.510 --> 10:19.350
The old Pru?

10:19.510 --> 10:20.670
Which one's that?

10:22.190 --> 10:25.030
- The addict? The degenerate?
- Screw you!

10:25.190 --> 10:27.030
Do you think this is me?

10:27.750 --> 10:29.750
The private GP?

10:29.910 --> 10:32.230
The status wife?

10:32.390 --> 10:33.990
And he makes you feel young
and free again?

10:34.150 --> 10:36.190
Before the big bad world
corrupted you.

10:36.350 --> 10:37.830
Well, boo-hoo! Grow up!

10:37.990 --> 10:39.670
You wouldn't understand.

10:39.830 --> 10:42.710
No, sure.
I've never had those feelings.

10:44.030 --> 10:46.230
I wasn't this person.

10:46.870 --> 10:49.270
I've never been this person.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.030
But nothing happened.

10:54.550 --> 10:55.710
OK?

10:56.510 --> 10:57.870
Nothing happened.

11:02.950 --> 11:05.910
Moving back here was the worst thing
we ever did!

11:08.510 --> 11:10.630
This is the place, Dad, look.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.390
Jesse Wells.

11:18.550 --> 11:19.670
Jesse.

11:19.830 --> 11:21.350
Mark's brother.

11:22.910 --> 11:23.910
Je...

11:30.150 --> 11:31.870
It's a missing child.

11:33.190 --> 11:34.670
It's Je...

11:37.590 --> 11:39.350
You investigated.

11:40.310 --> 11:42.430
Months and months and months
on that case.

11:45.510 --> 11:47.430
Where are the files, Dad?

11:51.070 --> 11:54.990
I looked in the place they should be,
that box: they're not there.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.830
Where are the files, Dad?

12:26.630 --> 12:27.990
Sorry.

12:58.430 --> 13:00.510
<i>Mark, it's me.</i>

13:01.350 --> 13:03.830
<i>It's Britnay, she's dead.</i>

13:19.870 --> 13:21.910
<i>Someone killed her.</i>

13:36.670 --> 13:40.110
<i>I'm going away for a while.
I just need some time.</i>

14:38.030 --> 14:40.030
The body that we found
out at Newman's.

14:40.190 --> 14:41.870
We've got a match.

14:42.030 --> 14:45.390
It's a 58-year-old local man
called Dr Aldus Croft.

14:46.350 --> 14:49.150
Well, he was a doctor
till he was struck off.

14:49.310 --> 14:51.470
He's a convicted rapist.

14:51.630 --> 14:54.790
They think he's been buried there
for about a year.

14:54.950 --> 14:57.670
And we've cross-checked the DNA
with Jesse?

14:57.830 --> 15:00.110
- Yeah, there's no match.
- OK.

15:00.270 --> 15:03.310
All right.
Let me just get this straight.

15:03.470 --> 15:08.150
We thought that this body may have
been Jesse/Gentle Hands.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.750
It's not, it's Croft.

15:11.470 --> 15:15.550
But that doesn't mean that Jesse
couldn't still be Gentle Hands.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.750
- Right?
- Right.

15:17.910 --> 15:20.990
We called Sasha and she corroborated
with what Jane said.

15:21.150 --> 15:24.190
We need to show her the picture
and see if she recognises him.

15:24.350 --> 15:26.630
I don't really like going inside
any more.

15:26.790 --> 15:28.190
It scares me.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.590
I'm sleeping in a caravan.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.790
This is the guy we found.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.030
Aldus Croft.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.790
Is he the guy who...

15:43.470 --> 15:45.350
Er... Gentle Hands.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.190
Yeah.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.390
I remember his eyes.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.950
That's definitely him.

15:59.630 --> 16:01.270
Hi.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.430
That's terrible.

16:28.230 --> 16:29.710
<i>Oh, Britnay.</i>

16:29.870 --> 16:32.070
For her to be in that place
for all those years,

16:32.230 --> 16:33.830
and then for this to happen.

16:34.390 --> 16:36.070
Yeah, it's awful.

16:40.750 --> 16:44.670
What is going on, Mark?
What are we all involved in?

16:46.990 --> 16:48.990
It scares me.

17:15.910 --> 17:16.950
Hello.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.990
Aw, thank you.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.350
- We'd better find your mum.
- There you are.

17:29.510 --> 17:32.750
What have I told you?
I've been looking everywhere.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.630
I should leave you.
Better off without.

17:35.550 --> 17:38.310
Oh, you dare!
Just you try it! Come on.

17:38.470 --> 17:40.310
Leave him alone.

17:41.030 --> 17:43.830
- You what?
- I said, leave him alone.

17:44.670 --> 17:45.990
He's just a child, he's a little boy.

17:46.150 --> 17:48.110
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

17:48.270 --> 17:50.710
You telling me how to deal
with my own kid?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.190
Eh?

17:52.350 --> 17:53.790
Who are you?

17:53.950 --> 17:55.550
You interfering old bitch.

17:57.350 --> 17:59.070
You should be cherishing him,

17:59.230 --> 18:01.630
not dragging him around
like some animal.

18:02.270 --> 18:05.070
That's your advice, is it?
That's what you've got for me?

18:05.230 --> 18:06.670
That's good advice.

18:07.550 --> 18:08.990
Ohh!

18:11.070 --> 18:13.590
Mind your own business, you old bag.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.990
Hey, Slade, it's me.

18:21.150 --> 18:23.790
<i>Listen, I hope you're OK, mate.
It's a real shock to all of us.</i>

18:23.950 --> 18:25.270
<i>But if you need me,</i>

18:25.430 --> 18:27.190
I'm here for you, OK?

18:27.350 --> 18:29.030
Take it easy, man.

18:29.950 --> 18:31.030
Excuse me.

18:31.190 --> 18:33.310
You can't just walk in!
Hello?

18:34.430 --> 18:35.390
Sorry, Stuart?

18:35.550 --> 18:37.350
Why do transvestites like Christmas?

18:37.510 --> 18:40.630
Cos they can eat, drink and be Mary.
Boom-boom.

18:42.350 --> 18:45.030
Right. Sorry, Stuart,
is there something you wanted?

18:45.190 --> 18:46.790
Shall we get some privacy?

18:47.870 --> 18:49.630
Sorry, Larry.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.430
Stuart, take a seat.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.590
I won't, thanks.

18:56.270 --> 18:58.550
Mark, you're an old friend
of my wife's.

18:58.710 --> 19:00.590
A childhood sweetheart, maybe.

19:00.750 --> 19:04.710
Now you're reconnecting and enjoying
it and that's great and wonderful.

19:04.870 --> 19:08.070
But if she contacts you again,
I'd like you to do me a favour.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.150
Don't answer the call.

19:12.590 --> 19:15.630
Pru's been through some tough times,
Mark, you may not know.

19:15.790 --> 19:18.310
But she needs stability, equilibrium.

19:18.470 --> 19:20.430
We're her oldest friends, Stuart.

19:25.630 --> 19:28.190
You are not part of her life
any more.

19:29.510 --> 19:31.110
Have you heard what I've said, Mark?

19:31.990 --> 19:34.030
Because she's my wife.

19:34.190 --> 19:35.990
And I know what's best for her.

19:37.870 --> 19:40.230
I think you better go, mate.

19:40.390 --> 19:42.350
Would you like me
to show this gentleman out?

19:42.510 --> 19:43.950
Yes, please, Larry.

19:44.110 --> 19:45.910
Don't answer her calls.

19:51.630 --> 19:53.510
Oh, Jesus Christ.

19:54.270 --> 19:55.710
Julie.

19:57.950 --> 19:59.430
I'm OK.

19:59.590 --> 20:02.510
Before you start fussing.

20:02.670 --> 20:05.030
- I've had worse.
- When, in your street-fighting days?

20:07.990 --> 20:11.350
It was my fault. I slapped her.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.470
You slapped her?
What did she say to you?

20:14.670 --> 20:17.830
- I was sticking my nose in.
- Quite literally.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.230
Julie.

20:19.830 --> 20:21.350
Just forget about it.

20:30.070 --> 20:32.150
Did he look like him?

20:33.150 --> 20:34.270
The kid?

20:34.910 --> 20:36.910
Did he look like Jesse?

20:38.350 --> 20:39.750
Not really.

20:40.830 --> 20:42.630
Same sort of age.

20:43.470 --> 20:46.310
Doesn't know how lucky she is.
Bitch of a woman.

20:47.350 --> 20:49.230
Screaming at him...

20:49.390 --> 20:51.150
dragging his arm.

20:54.990 --> 20:56.430
Were we like that?

20:57.230 --> 20:59.590
- Did we take him for granted?
- No.

21:00.110 --> 21:02.870
I mean, we drank too much,
we were tired.

21:03.030 --> 21:05.750
Two young boys... short fuse.

21:05.910 --> 21:07.670
He was loved.

21:10.590 --> 21:12.150
He was loved.

21:30.350 --> 21:31.550
Then... Wham!

21:31.710 --> 21:34.630
This Payne guy attacks me,
tells me to stay away.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.310
And where does this Payne guy work?
Porter and Starr.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.150
These can't be coincidences.

21:39.310 --> 21:43.790
So I think, if I find out what
the deal is with this Alexa Mills,

21:43.950 --> 21:46.030
then I'm gonna be able
to get some answers about Jesse.

21:46.190 --> 21:48.390
Selena Callaway's daughter's
called Alexa.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.350
We're looking for her.

21:52.550 --> 21:57.110
You know, Mark, when someone attacks
you and tells you to stay away,

21:57.270 --> 21:58.670
there's usually
a good reason for that.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.590
It means we're onto something,
doesn't it?

22:03.550 --> 22:05.430
Look, you're upset about Britnay.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.950
You really think this is the time
to be chasing after Jesse?

22:08.790 --> 22:10.910
You know, you might not like
what you find.

22:11.070 --> 22:12.830
What does that mean?

22:14.310 --> 22:16.430
Danny, you're not telling me
something.

22:18.910 --> 22:20.190
- Danny?
- Mark...

22:20.350 --> 22:23.110
Don't lie to me, mate.
I can tell by your face.

22:23.270 --> 22:26.350
You know what I need from you now?
To leave this to the police.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.150
What is it?

22:28.310 --> 22:30.790
I need you and Slade to stop
marching around town thinking...

22:30.950 --> 22:32.070
What is it?

22:36.470 --> 22:38.630
We found something.

22:41.590 --> 22:45.030
The studio where the girls
were kept, Gemma and Britnay.

22:46.190 --> 22:49.190
We found traces of blood
and it matches Jesse's DNA.

22:54.350 --> 22:58.230
<i>Listen, Larry... I'm not coming
into the office today.</i>

22:58.390 --> 23:01.510
<i>I need to find out more
about this Selena Callaway.</i>

23:01.670 --> 23:03.950
<i>I think she can lead me to Jesse.</i>

23:21.190 --> 23:24.550
I was wondering if you know
a woman called Selena Callaway.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.350
Tash?

23:44.510 --> 23:47.430
Mark, I'm Slade's friend.
I work at the shelter sometimes.

23:47.590 --> 23:50.230
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen you with him.

23:50.390 --> 23:53.030
What are you doing down these parts?
Looking for someone?

23:53.190 --> 23:55.750
Kind of. I'm looking for this woman.

23:56.790 --> 23:57.990
Selena.

23:58.150 --> 24:01.390
Well, you ain't gonna find her.
She got murdered.

24:01.550 --> 24:03.110
Yeah, I know, yeah.

24:03.270 --> 24:04.950
What do you know about her?

24:05.110 --> 24:07.030
Selena was working for these guys.

24:07.190 --> 24:10.070
I'd seen them around,
didn't like their faces.

24:10.230 --> 24:12.590
Some people give off vibes,
you know?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.910
But in this game,
if there's the offer of easy cash,

24:15.070 --> 24:16.790
people are all too willing.

24:16.950 --> 24:19.350
- And Selena was?
- She was always short of cash.

24:19.510 --> 24:21.030
- Drug habit?
- No.

24:21.190 --> 24:24.590
She thought she was better than us.
Did some college course - computers.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.870
I guess that's how
she got involved in the scam.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.150
What scam?

24:28.310 --> 24:31.150
- They were robbing people.
- What do you mean? How?

24:31.310 --> 24:33.710
They set up some device
that punters would log into,

24:33.870 --> 24:35.110
thinking it was free Wi-Fi.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.430
It stripped info from their phone.

24:37.590 --> 24:38.830
What kind of info?

24:38.990 --> 24:43.470
Like the fact that they pay money
for sex, bank details, all sorts.

24:43.630 --> 24:45.230
She took me to the hotel they used.

24:45.390 --> 24:47.310
But I told her I wasn't interested.

24:47.470 --> 24:50.750
She's yelling at me: "You'd rather
suck cock than earn real money!"

24:50.910 --> 24:53.230
But maybe it saved my life.

24:55.150 --> 24:57.230
So the hotel that they used...

24:57.390 --> 24:59.670
was that the same hotel
that she was killed in?

24:59.830 --> 25:02.350
No. That was the strange thing.

25:02.910 --> 25:06.150
The scam ran out of a different
place, the Old Town Hotel.

25:06.310 --> 25:09.510
The Old Town Hotel?
Were they involved in the scam?

25:10.430 --> 25:11.950
You'd think so.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.510
It's a real dive,
it has these themed rooms.

25:14.670 --> 25:16.590
They always used the Envy Room.

25:16.750 --> 25:19.510
- People like that shit.
- The Envy Room?

25:19.670 --> 25:21.030
Listen...

25:21.190 --> 25:23.230
No offence,
but you're costing me money.

25:23.750 --> 25:24.710
Sure.

26:21.470 --> 26:22.990
Will his tree grow
as big as my tree?

26:24.710 --> 26:25.670
One day.

26:25.830 --> 26:29.350
When you're both bigger,
they'll be as high as the house.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.630
Oh, Julie.

27:20.110 --> 27:21.990
- I'm doing it.
- Julie.

27:22.150 --> 27:25.190
You're right what you said.
I have wasted all those years.

27:25.350 --> 27:27.110
Julie, no, just stop.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.790
Stop.

27:28.950 --> 27:31.310
Come here. Julie, no more. No more.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.070
I've wasted so much time.

27:34.710 --> 27:37.030
Why did it have to happen to us?

27:37.190 --> 27:38.630
Why us?

27:38.790 --> 27:42.710
Why not the bitch in the market?
I mean, we're good people.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.710
We're good people!

27:44.870 --> 27:47.350
We're never gonna get
those years back.

27:47.510 --> 27:50.390
We've still got time.

27:50.550 --> 27:52.590
We don't have to die
as these people.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.470
We don't have to be victims.

28:01.190 --> 28:03.350
It's all right now. It's all right.

28:03.510 --> 28:05.430
It's all right.

28:05.590 --> 28:06.790
Yeah?

28:06.950 --> 28:08.670
Ally, do you have any raisins?

28:09.390 --> 28:11.990
I'm sorry.
I said, do you have any raisins?

28:13.830 --> 28:15.710
OK, well how about a date?

28:15.870 --> 28:17.750
I'm busy, Karl.

28:17.910 --> 28:19.790
See, are you Jamaican?

28:19.950 --> 28:22.870
Cause you're Ja-maican me crazy.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.190
Are you serious?

28:25.350 --> 28:27.470
Yes, I'm serious.
Let me take you out.

28:29.070 --> 28:30.670
I don't think so.

28:31.390 --> 28:33.270
You... me...

28:34.110 --> 28:35.590
Think about it.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.670
We could have a great time.

28:39.310 --> 28:40.710
Sleep on it.

28:41.510 --> 28:43.390
And for the meantime...

28:43.550 --> 28:47.470
here is a sneak... preview.

28:50.630 --> 28:52.030
Get out.

28:54.990 --> 28:56.270
Ally?

28:59.270 --> 29:01.790
Look, we've got to go see
Jakob Marosi.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.750
Marosi, why?

29:08.110 --> 29:11.430
The timeline's off, OK?
He couldn't have done it.

29:11.590 --> 29:12.950
He's lying.

29:13.110 --> 29:14.710
Well, did you check the case files?

29:17.030 --> 29:18.390
What is it?

29:21.350 --> 29:25.030
I'm gonna tell you something
but this stays between us, OK?

29:25.190 --> 29:26.070
Yeah, of course.

29:27.350 --> 29:28.790
They're missing.

29:28.950 --> 29:30.870
What do you mean, they're missing?

29:31.030 --> 29:33.430
I don't know.
I don't know, they're just missing.

29:33.590 --> 29:36.630
But what I do know is that
Marosi's confession is bullshit.

29:55.070 --> 29:56.270
Pretty girl.

29:58.150 --> 30:00.470
We'd like to ask you some questions

30:00.630 --> 30:03.110
about the disappearance
of Jesse Wells in 1995.

30:04.190 --> 30:06.550
He was good,
one of my favourites.

30:06.710 --> 30:08.590
Oh, you can skip the performance.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.990
There's a book about you,
you've been immortalised.

30:11.150 --> 30:13.630
We don't need
the whole child-killer routine.

30:15.870 --> 30:17.430
Charmer.

30:20.030 --> 30:21.590
Is he like this with you?

30:24.510 --> 30:27.190
So, erm... you confessed
to murdering him.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.390
That's because I did it.

30:29.790 --> 30:33.710
Yeah, you know, new evidence
suggests that's highly unlikely.

30:33.870 --> 30:35.550
- New evidence?
- Yeah.

30:38.750 --> 30:41.190
OK, then, I didn't.

30:41.350 --> 30:43.750
Oh, I'm convinced you didn't.

30:45.910 --> 30:50.070
So that being the case,
why did you lie about killing him?

30:50.510 --> 30:54.270
Are you saying your fellow policemen
got it all wrong?

30:55.270 --> 30:57.870
They were happy enough
to believe it at the time.

30:58.030 --> 31:02.950
Happy enough to let the press
splash it across their front pages.

31:03.110 --> 31:06.750
Oh, I know. The officer in charge
of that case was my father.

31:08.230 --> 31:11.270
- What is your name again?
- DS Daniel Kenwood.

31:12.790 --> 31:14.630
Ray's boy?

31:14.790 --> 31:15.790
Yeah.

31:16.390 --> 31:18.390
Oh, no.

31:19.270 --> 31:20.750
I should have known.

31:21.110 --> 31:23.070
Interview's terminated.

31:23.230 --> 31:24.590
- I'm sorry...
- Interview over.

31:24.750 --> 31:27.070
I have nothing more to say to you.

31:28.430 --> 31:29.910
Son of Ray Kenwood!

31:30.350 --> 31:32.950
Black man doing a white man's job.

31:34.350 --> 31:37.110
Trying to prove
he was up to the cut.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.550
Willing to do whatever it takes
to get result.

31:42.870 --> 31:44.550
Interview over.

31:45.190 --> 31:48.390
I have nothing more to say
to the son of Ray Kenwood.

32:15.950 --> 32:18.510
Hi. I was wondering
if you could help me.

32:18.670 --> 32:22.350
That's what I'm here for, sir,
and my sign is the confirmation.

32:24.350 --> 32:28.510
So, we do rooms by the hour,
rooms by the day, rooms by the week.

32:28.670 --> 32:29.710
The week?

32:29.870 --> 32:31.430
Yes, it's what people want.

32:31.590 --> 32:34.430
Mine is not to reason why,
mine is to take their money.

32:34.590 --> 32:37.630
I can arrange for female company,
I can arrange male company,

32:37.790 --> 32:39.670
I can arrange anything you like.

32:39.830 --> 32:41.550
No kink too strange.

32:41.710 --> 32:45.070
So, my good friend,
how can I help you?

32:45.230 --> 32:47.310
I want to see the Envy Room.

32:47.470 --> 32:49.150
Ah, the Envy man.

32:49.310 --> 32:53.030
A man with a penchant
for fruitless yearning, are we?

32:53.630 --> 32:55.070
I just want to see it.

32:56.150 --> 33:00.150
I'm afraid it's occupied at the moment.
Somebody took it for a month.

33:00.310 --> 33:02.630
A month? I thought you said
the longest was a week?

33:02.790 --> 33:04.310
Yes, well, they took it for a week,

33:04.470 --> 33:06.710
then at the end of that week,
they took it for another.

33:06.870 --> 33:09.430
And then at the end of that week,
they took it for another week.

33:09.590 --> 33:12.670
I get the picture. I guess you're
not prepared to tell me who took it?

33:12.830 --> 33:13.950
Correct.

33:14.110 --> 33:16.390
Confidentiality is my middle name.

33:16.550 --> 33:18.430
Well, actually, it's Leonard.

33:18.590 --> 33:21.190
That's because my parents
were Reggie Perrin fans.

33:21.350 --> 33:23.270
Is the occupant in right now?

33:24.070 --> 33:27.510
I wouldn't know.
He doesn't even let us in to clean.

33:27.670 --> 33:31.510
Right. Well, how about we take
a walk down there, see if he's in?

33:31.670 --> 33:34.470
If he's not in,
I can have a little peep inside.

33:35.110 --> 33:36.710
- A peep?
- Thirty seconds.

33:37.550 --> 33:41.030
Breach of guest's privacy.
I'm sorry, sir.

33:41.190 --> 33:44.550
There are no possible circumstances
in which that scenario could happen.

33:44.710 --> 33:46.070
- Fifty quid.
- Done.

33:55.670 --> 33:57.110
Hello?

33:57.550 --> 34:00.590
In and out quick as you can.
That's our motto.

34:07.150 --> 34:09.550
Jesus Christ.

34:10.270 --> 34:12.150
Get out.
Did you know about this?

34:12.310 --> 34:14.710
- No.
- Why did you want to see the room?

34:14.870 --> 34:16.790
Who are you? What's happening?

34:16.949 --> 34:19.510
- I don't know.
- Where are you going? Come back here!

34:19.670 --> 34:22.230
I'm calling the... police.

34:31.310 --> 34:33.550
Slade, it's Mark.

34:33.710 --> 34:35.909
I hope you're OK, mate.

34:36.469 --> 34:37.949
Look, just um...

34:38.110 --> 34:40.710
Give us a call, yeah? Because...

34:41.909 --> 34:43.989
we're all really worried
about you.

34:44.150 --> 34:48.389
You know, I know that you can
look after yourself, right? But...

34:50.870 --> 34:52.310
You loved her.

34:56.870 --> 35:00.070
I'm just trying to say...
just come back soon.

35:02.990 --> 35:05.510
I need you, mate.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.270
- Show me your phone!
- No.

36:28.430 --> 36:30.110
I know it's from him.
Show me your phone.

36:30.270 --> 36:32.550
- You are being...
- Show me the goddamn phone!

36:32.710 --> 36:34.990
You want to see it?
There's the phone!

36:37.630 --> 36:39.630
From Mark. Surprise, surprise.

36:40.510 --> 36:43.750
"I need to speak to you.
Call me. Kiss"

36:45.150 --> 36:47.790
Well, here you go, Pru.

36:48.390 --> 36:51.070
You'd better give him a call. Kiss.

36:51.230 --> 36:52.750
I don't need this.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.870
Oh, beautiful, storming out!
How convenient!

36:56.030 --> 36:58.070
Storm out, blame me, go to him.

36:58.230 --> 37:00.350
- I'm not going to him.
- Where are you going?

37:00.510 --> 37:03.510
- I'm getting away from you!
- From me? What about your daughter?

37:03.670 --> 37:07.230
You've got a daughter. Will you be
back or shall I prepare your excuses?

37:07.390 --> 37:11.190
Stuart, please, just let me
have some time on my own.

37:11.350 --> 37:13.710
- I'll know if you've been with him.
- I can't be around you now.

37:13.870 --> 37:15.550
Just leave me alone!

37:27.510 --> 37:30.630
Hi, can I get a gin and tonic,
please? A double.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.390
Rough day?

37:40.030 --> 37:42.070
Sometimes, Karl, I wish I had a job

37:42.230 --> 37:46.230
that didn't constantly remind me what
a disturbing place the world can be.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.270
Well, you know what they say.

37:48.430 --> 37:52.590
Alcohol is the anaesthetic by which
we endure the operation of life.

37:54.550 --> 37:56.190
That's almost profound.

37:57.230 --> 37:59.030
It was on a beer mat.

38:01.390 --> 38:04.870
- Just get me drunk.
- I think I can manage that.

39:43.310 --> 39:46.270
Oh, hi. Sorry, I should have called.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.230
Can we talk?

39:50.350 --> 39:52.350
Sure, yeah. Come in.

40:25.550 --> 40:26.470
Thanks.

40:30.550 --> 40:33.030
I... I just wanted to say...

40:34.630 --> 40:37.910
I really appreciate
everything you've been doing.

40:38.070 --> 40:41.750
Looking for Kenton, helping Simon.

40:42.670 --> 40:44.710
He really appreciates it too.

40:45.430 --> 40:47.430
It's OK, he's a good kid.

40:58.710 --> 41:00.870
I also wanted to say...

41:02.870 --> 41:07.310
the months we spent together,
they really meant a lot to me.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.430
They were really special, Mark.

41:13.270 --> 41:17.350
To be honest, I'd never felt like that
before. You know, it scared me.

41:17.510 --> 41:20.910
I felt out of control.

41:21.070 --> 41:24.790
You know, when you're running down
a hill and you can't stop?

41:26.030 --> 41:28.310
I don't know why
I'm saying any of this,

41:28.470 --> 41:30.830
or how I expect you to react,
I just...

41:35.750 --> 41:37.750
I wasn't there for you.

41:40.470 --> 41:44.590
Hardest time in your life
with Jesse and...

41:44.750 --> 41:46.750
you needed me.

41:46.910 --> 41:49.030
- It's OK.
- No. No, it's not.

41:49.190 --> 41:52.510
I'm sorry.

41:55.590 --> 41:57.670
I'm really sorry, Mark.

42:40.190 --> 42:41.830
All right, all right!

42:42.550 --> 42:44.830
- Where is she?
- Stuart?

42:44.990 --> 42:48.310
Where's my wife?
I warned you! I warned you!

42:48.470 --> 42:49.790
- She's not here.
- Bullshit!

42:49.950 --> 42:53.070
Whoa, whoa! You're in my house.
You need to calm down.

42:53.230 --> 42:55.990
You're gonna lie to my face?
Think you can hide her?

42:56.150 --> 42:58.350
What is she, naked,
bent over for you?

42:58.510 --> 43:01.190
Stuart, I'm telling you.
She is not here.

43:01.350 --> 43:03.630
Bullshit! I know she's here.

43:03.790 --> 43:06.270
I know she's here
because I tracked her.

43:06.990 --> 43:10.110
Now, where is she?
Where's my wife, huh?

43:10.830 --> 43:11.790
Wait.

43:13.150 --> 43:15.550
Will you tell this prick
there's no one else here?

43:15.710 --> 43:17.510
- Who is he?
- Who are you?

43:20.350 --> 43:22.590
- There's no one else here.
- Get out of my flat.

43:24.470 --> 43:27.350
- She's here. She has to be here.
- You out of your mind?

43:29.950 --> 43:31.190
Wait.

43:36.630 --> 43:39.230
Pru! Pru, stop!

43:40.910 --> 43:42.350
Enough!

43:53.510 --> 43:55.230
Three acts.

43:58.470 --> 44:00.070
Act one.

44:03.670 --> 44:05.070
Act two.

44:08.070 --> 44:09.630
And finally...

44:11.390 --> 44:13.070
act three.
