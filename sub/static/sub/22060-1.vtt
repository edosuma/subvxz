An off-duty cop,

shot and killed

00:22.873 --> 00:24.907

no knife, no gun--

is swarming.

00:33.183 --> 00:35.050

deadly force?

00:35.052 --> 00:36.351
The victim was shoplifting,

00:36.353 --> 00:38.754
and when the officer tried to
intervene, it became physical.

00:38.756 --> 00:40.556
So shot
in the commission of a crime?

00:40.558 --> 00:41.757

Assault, four counts
of robbery dating back

with intent to sell,

00:47.498 --> 00:49.531

walking around with pills,

10:06.774 --> 10:09.041
asking if anyone wanted Molly.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.910
Next thing, kids were
dropping like flies.

10:10.912 --> 10:12.778
A guy? What did
he look like?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.180
It was so dark, I...

10:14.182 --> 10:15.748
Give me a break, you didn't
get a name or a description?

10:15.750 --> 10:18.584
He uses the nickname "Ice."
<b><font color="#FF0080">JANKO:</font></b> Uses?

10:18.586 --> 10:22.388
- You know this guy?
- No.

10:22.390 --> 10:23.622
All right, let's
see some ID.

10:23.624 --> 10:27.493
Look, you're not gonna tell
my mom about this, right?

10:27.495 --> 10:30.296
Let me see some ID.

10:30.298 --> 10:31.997
His appointment book

10:31.999 --> 10:33.954
is full of clients
and court dates.

10:33.978 --> 10:34.668
Yeah.

10:34.669 --> 10:37.069
His last appointment
was at 5:00.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.805
Hey, I already told you we're
not working the case, okay?

10:39.807 --> 10:42.341
We're gonna hand it off
to Homicide, so just stop.

10:42.343 --> 10:44.743
I know.
Okay, then.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.278
According to this,

10:46.280 --> 10:47.880
Jack was meeting

10:47.882 --> 10:49.448
a Dr. W. here.

10:49.450 --> 10:50.583
Baez.

10:50.585 --> 10:51.784
Detectives.

10:55.056 --> 10:56.489
Are you
Jack Boyle's assistant?

10:56.491 --> 10:57.857
Maria Cuesta.
I'm Detective Baez.

10:57.859 --> 11:00.426
Where were you
when Jack was attacked?

11:00.428 --> 11:02.728
He sent me to court
to file a motion.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.764
And who was this
Dr. W. at 5:00?

11:05.766 --> 11:07.132
Dr. Weber.

11:08.369 --> 11:11.737
Hold on. You're talking
about the same Dr. Weber

11:11.739 --> 11:13.739
that Jack represented
against Erin?

11:13.741 --> 11:16.242
Yup.
How'd that meeting go?

11:16.244 --> 11:18.511
He came to ask Mr. Boyle
to represent him.

11:18.513 --> 11:20.145
Again?

11:20.147 --> 11:21.480
In what case?

11:21.482 --> 11:23.949
I don't know.
Because Mr. Boyle said

11:23.951 --> 11:26.852
he would never
represent him on any case.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.256
All right.
If we need anything else,

11:30.258 --> 11:32.424
we'll let you know.

11:35.897 --> 11:39.064
So where's this homicide
detective who caught the case?

11:39.934 --> 11:41.500
I guess you're looking at him.

11:55.024 --> 11:57.191
<font color="#0CEC0C">(heart monitor beeping steadily)</font>

12:06.402 --> 12:09.737
Really, Jack?

12:09.739 --> 12:11.939
Our wedding photo?

12:24.987 --> 12:28.355
I need to remind you that
Nicky is graduating this year

12:28.357 --> 12:30.591
and you need to be there.

12:30.593 --> 12:33.093
And when she gets married,

12:33.095 --> 12:35.229
that's your job
to walk her down the aisle.

12:35.231 --> 12:36.730
You got that?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.968
You've got to pull
through, Jack.

12:40.970 --> 12:43.337
You owe that to her.

12:43.339 --> 12:45.739
You hear me?

12:45.741 --> 12:47.908
Ms. Reagan?

12:47.910 --> 12:49.409
We got the results back.

12:49.411 --> 12:51.078
Your husband needs surgery.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.046
Ex-h... Ex-husband.
Uh, when?

12:53.048 --> 12:54.882
Immediately. He's got
internal bleeding,

12:54.884 --> 12:56.283
a ruptured spleen.

12:56.285 --> 12:58.018
We're prepping
the O.R. right now.

12:58.020 --> 12:59.253
We'll need your consent.

12:59.255 --> 13:01.655
W... My...
Uh, I don't understand.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.757
You're the one listed
as his next of kin.

13:05.461 --> 13:06.994
We need to do this ASAP

13:06.996 --> 13:08.896
or he's not gonna make it.

13:08.898 --> 13:11.999
I'll send in a nurse with the
consent forms for you to sign.

13:15.404 --> 13:17.337
I remember the day
you got this.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.107
First time I ever met
a sitting president.

13:20.109 --> 13:22.576
- Had a lot of people cross this floor.
- Yeah.

13:22.578 --> 13:24.611
Bill Clinton
was my personal favorite.

13:24.613 --> 13:27.381
I want you both to know
I've secured positions for you

13:27.383 --> 13:28.715
within the department.

13:28.717 --> 13:30.350
Sid, you'll be
the new C.O.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.786
of Manhattan North,
and, Baker...

13:32.788 --> 13:35.956
this department can always use
a decorated detective.

13:35.958 --> 13:37.958
I'd rather be here.
Me, too.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.295
Well, you'll have to
take that up with my successor.

13:41.297 --> 13:43.864
Chapter one, point ten
of the city charter:

13:43.866 --> 13:46.867
"While so acting
temporarily as mayor,

13:46.869 --> 13:49.169
"the public advocate
shall not exercise

13:49.171 --> 13:52.773
"any power of appointment to
or removal from office

13:52.775 --> 13:55.042
"or any power
lawfully delegated

13:55.044 --> 13:56.310
by the mayor."

13:56.312 --> 13:57.978
She can't fire you.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.815
I'm aware of that.

14:01.817 --> 14:03.317
Are you kidding?
That's great.

14:03.319 --> 14:04.751
Thing is...

14:06.055 --> 14:08.689
...my new boss wants me gone.

14:08.691 --> 14:10.624
It doesn't matter
what she wants.

14:10.626 --> 14:11.992
It's what <i>you</i> want.

14:11.994 --> 14:14.494
You think I should
just barricade in here

14:14.496 --> 14:17.064
because of some fine print
in the city charter?

14:17.066 --> 14:18.732
Boss, are you telling us

14:18.734 --> 14:20.500
you got no more fight
left in you?

14:20.502 --> 14:22.769
Oh, that's not gonna work, Sid.
What, you can't

14:22.771 --> 14:24.071
take a challenge?
And I'm not

14:24.073 --> 14:27.307
ten years old and you are not
Sister Mary Damien

14:27.309 --> 14:30.277
screaming at me
from the sidelines.

14:30.279 --> 14:31.879
All right, you're your age now,
and you're the PC

14:31.881 --> 14:33.580
and they're stringing up a noose
for one of your men.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.115
You're just gonna let them?
Please.

14:35.117 --> 14:37.251
Shaming me's not gonna work, either.
<b><font color="#FF0080">BAKER:</font></b> I would like

14:37.253 --> 14:39.319
to say something.
As a woman.

14:39.321 --> 14:40.854
That is the biggest
load of crap

14:40.856 --> 14:42.155
that I have
ever heard.

14:42.157 --> 14:43.857
You're just gonna
let this broad

14:43.859 --> 14:45.092
push you out the door?

14:45.094 --> 14:47.794
This broad happens to be
mayor of New York City.

14:47.796 --> 14:50.030
So what?
That's all you've got--

14:50.032 --> 14:51.798
"I don't think
the mayor likes me"?!

14:51.800 --> 14:54.368
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to here?!

15:10.586 --> 15:11.985
I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

15:11.987 --> 15:14.621
Lieutenant Simon Kinnear.
Narcotics.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.089
Please, have a seat.

15:16.091 --> 15:17.824
This about the overdoses
at the party?

15:17.826 --> 15:19.793
Six kids died at that
party last night because

15:19.795 --> 15:21.528
some punk drug dealer
decided to mix

15:21.530 --> 15:23.263
a lethal amount of
fentanyl in the capsules.

15:23.265 --> 15:25.198
What's that
got to do with us?

15:25.200 --> 15:27.200
Well, when you responded to the
club, you got some information

15:27.202 --> 15:29.903
from a kid whose girlfriend
went into arrest.

15:29.905 --> 15:30.904
Ryan Young.

15:30.906 --> 15:31.939
We flipped him.

15:31.941 --> 15:33.373
He's willing to
make an introduction

15:33.375 --> 15:36.043
to the drug dealer who sold the
drugs. Goes by the name of Ice.

15:36.045 --> 15:37.477
That's great.

15:37.479 --> 15:40.781
Yeah. But he will
only work with you.

15:42.084 --> 15:43.116
You interested?

15:43.118 --> 15:44.785
To get a drug dealer

15:44.787 --> 15:45.704
off the streets?
Hell yeah.

15:45.728 --> 15:46.854
Good.

15:46.855 --> 15:48.622
Have to make it look
a little less suspicious.

15:48.624 --> 15:49.923
You need a girlfriend.

15:49.925 --> 15:52.025
Guess that's where
I come in?

15:52.027 --> 15:53.393
I've always wanted
to be arm candy.

15:53.395 --> 15:55.896
Now, we want you
to make a buy.

15:55.898 --> 15:58.765
Young will meet you
inside the club

15:58.767 --> 16:00.033
and introduce you

16:00.035 --> 16:02.836
to Bryce Medero,

16:02.838 --> 16:04.304
aka Ice.

16:04.306 --> 16:06.106
What happens
if we get into trouble?

16:06.108 --> 16:07.607
If things get
out of hand,

16:07.609 --> 16:11.178
you'll use an agreed-upon
safe word to alert us.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.547
How about
"get us the hell out of here"?

16:13.549 --> 16:16.149
Yeah, would that work?

16:17.987 --> 16:20.854
Apparently Weber wanted
to retain Jack's services again.

16:20.856 --> 16:22.289
You know what that was about?

16:22.291 --> 16:24.758
After I lost the case
against Weber,

16:24.760 --> 16:27.127
I took a magnifying glass
to his life.

16:27.129 --> 16:29.196
Apparently... another one
of his girlfriends

16:29.198 --> 16:30.731
disappeared five years ago.

16:30.733 --> 16:32.399
Body was never found.

16:32.401 --> 16:34.134
So I reopened that case.

16:34.136 --> 16:36.370
And he wanted Jack
to represent him,

16:36.372 --> 16:38.372
Jack said no.

16:38.374 --> 16:40.774
Which may have set Weber off.

16:40.776 --> 16:44.277
All I know is Jack was anxious
to talk about something.

16:44.279 --> 16:46.146
Does Weber have an alibi for
the day this girl disappeared?

16:46.148 --> 16:49.316
He says he put her on a train to
Manhattan, never saw her again.

16:49.318 --> 16:50.027
Oh, my goodness.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.864
Without a body
it's hard to convict.

16:52.421 --> 16:53.487
Well, what do you think?

16:53.489 --> 16:54.921
Were you able to get a subpoena

16:54.923 --> 16:56.256
for his phone records
or something?

16:56.258 --> 16:57.357
Based on what?

16:57.359 --> 16:58.692
Based on the fact
that he's already

16:58.694 --> 16:59.826
confessed to <i>one</i> murder.

16:59.828 --> 17:01.528
That has no bearing
on this case.

17:01.530 --> 17:03.163
Oh, come on.

17:03.165 --> 17:05.332
Mom! Quick!

17:05.334 --> 17:07.099
What? What happened?

17:08.069 --> 17:09.469
No, Dad's awake.

17:12.207 --> 17:13.740
Hi.
Oh.

17:15.477 --> 17:17.778
How you feeling?

17:17.780 --> 17:21.448
Like I've gone through
a wood chipper.

17:21.450 --> 17:24.284
Well, it proves you
got thick skin, Jack.

17:24.286 --> 17:26.185
Mom and Uncle Danny

17:26.188 --> 17:28.855
are the ones that found you
and got you to the hospital.

17:30.826 --> 17:32.726
Did you get a look
at their face,

17:32.728 --> 17:34.594
remember their voice, anything?

17:34.596 --> 17:38.131
All I remember is someone...

17:38.133 --> 17:41.601
h-hitting me in the head
from behind.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.075
I love you, Dad.

17:48.077 --> 17:49.476
I'm so happy

17:49.478 --> 17:51.711
you woke up.

18:09.298 --> 18:13.233
Why don't you tell me
how you see the problem?

18:16.071 --> 18:17.437
You do realize

18:17.439 --> 18:19.206
you're taking advice
from a murderer, right?

18:19.208 --> 18:20.807
Might want to save
yourself some money

18:20.809 --> 18:22.109
and save yourself, possibly,

18:22.111 --> 18:24.144
by getting the hell out of here
as quick as you can.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.513
Detective...

18:26.515 --> 18:27.781
I'm just saying.

18:27.783 --> 18:29.683
Is this absolutely necessary?
Well, I didn't want

18:29.685 --> 18:32.419
to embarrass you in front
of your, uh, patient there.

fight about?

18:38.227 --> 18:40.494
I-I would love to help you
but, unfortunately,

18:40.496 --> 18:43.096
I think that's covered
under attorney-client privilege.

18:43.098 --> 18:44.931
Where were you yesterday
at 11:00 a.m.?

18:44.933 --> 18:48.101
Where were you May 28?

18:49.037 --> 18:51.571
What did you just say?

18:51.573 --> 18:54.074
Where were you May 28?

18:59.414 --> 19:01.314
Danny! Danny.

19:01.316 --> 19:03.917
Walk away! Just walk away!

19:29.943 --> 19:32.143
Are you sure you don't
want me to unpack that?

19:32.145 --> 19:34.512
No, thank you.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.915
Should I put it away, then?

19:37.917 --> 19:40.685
It's fine where it is.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.055
May I ask what's in it?

19:48.094 --> 19:50.862
The cash, the weapons,
the secret tapes.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.466
Abigail...

19:55.468 --> 19:57.402
I'm tired.

21:09.843 --> 21:10.742
Listen, how you holding up?

21:10.744 --> 21:11.876
Considering the papers
are saying

21:11.878 --> 21:13.411
that I killed
a defenseless woman,

21:13.413 --> 21:14.812
that I'm a murderer?

21:14.814 --> 21:17.882
Well, you'd do well not to pay
any attention to the press.

21:17.884 --> 21:19.617
Tell that to my
five-year-old.

21:19.619 --> 21:21.185
<font color="#FF5500">(exhales)</font>

21:21.187 --> 21:22.720
When there's a police shooting,

21:22.722 --> 21:26.023
the first 24 hours
are always a free-for-all.

21:26.025 --> 21:27.959
But it's the PC's job
to be a real champion

21:27.961 --> 21:29.394
for the guys in blue.

21:29.396 --> 21:31.028
Without that, there'd
be a lot more cops

21:31.030 --> 21:33.030
dropping out of the department.

21:33.032 --> 21:35.700
I'm walking the beat
with a target on my back.

21:35.702 --> 21:37.435
The truth is gonna come out.

21:37.437 --> 21:39.070
The press can be brutal,
for sure,

21:39.072 --> 21:40.605
but that's what we're here for.

21:40.607 --> 21:42.273
To make sure you get your say.

21:42.275 --> 21:44.609
To know that you've got someone
at the top watching your back.

21:44.611 --> 21:47.545
I'm resigning.

21:51.651 --> 21:53.818
Don't pull your pin.

21:53.820 --> 21:56.454
Clear your name.

21:56.456 --> 21:58.289
And,

21:58.291 --> 22:00.558
please, there's nothing
that you're gonna say

22:00.560 --> 22:02.493
that's going to change my mind.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.973

22:15.975 --> 22:18.176
Yeah, well, that's because the
guy is a cold-blooded killer

22:18.178 --> 22:19.610
who's walking around free.
Eh.

22:19.612 --> 22:21.446

22:23.917 --> 22:25.416
was when he mentioned May 28.

22:25.418 --> 22:26.236
- Hey. No.
- The day that...

22:26.237 --> 22:27.886
No, I can't do this, okay?

22:27.887 --> 22:29.487
You can't do what?
You can't talk about it?

22:29.489 --> 22:30.354
I just said I can't!

22:30.356 --> 22:31.823
Can't what?!

22:32.692 --> 22:34.859
<font color="#FF5500">(sighs)</font>

22:35.728 --> 22:39.330
I can't do this without my wife.

22:39.332 --> 22:41.532
Okay?

22:44.204 --> 22:46.771
I think you can.

22:50.743 --> 22:52.710
I know what it's like

22:52.712 --> 22:55.313
to lose the love of your life.

22:55.315 --> 22:58.483
I lost mine ten years ago.

22:58.485 --> 23:00.685
Well, what does that mean?

23:00.687 --> 23:04.589
That you're supposed to shed
some light on it for me?

23:04.591 --> 23:07.058
Teach me how to cope?

23:07.060 --> 23:09.660
Unfortunately, I...

23:09.662 --> 23:14.499
I don't have a...
a magic formula.

23:14.501 --> 23:15.933
I still miss her.

23:15.935 --> 23:17.935
But I'm able
to live my life.

23:17.937 --> 23:20.838
And that's what
everyone wants for you.

23:22.842 --> 23:26.511
Linda's death wasn't your fault.

23:30.650 --> 23:33.284
I know.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.319
So whose fault was it?

23:35.321 --> 23:36.888
No one's.

23:36.890 --> 23:39.824
Really?

23:39.826 --> 23:42.360
'Cause, see,
if I hadn't been working late

23:42.362 --> 23:45.329
and she hadn't changed her shift
because of me,

23:45.331 --> 23:47.365
because of my job...

23:47.367 --> 23:50.067
Just as she had done
a dozen times before that.

23:50.069 --> 23:52.603
She was doing
her job.

23:52.605 --> 23:56.541
She died doing what she loved.

23:56.543 --> 23:58.643
What you would have done.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.178
I should've stopped her.

24:01.180 --> 24:03.080
No, Danny, she...

24:03.082 --> 24:07.118
Danny, she died in a helicopter
crash airlifting her patient.

24:14.027 --> 24:17.061
I should've been home more, Doc.

24:17.864 --> 24:20.064
You know?

24:20.900 --> 24:22.867
I wasn't.

24:22.869 --> 24:25.202
You've been coming
here for months,

24:25.204 --> 24:28.306
and you have never uttered
the words that she's gone,

24:28.308 --> 24:30.875
that she's dead,
she's never coming back.

24:30.877 --> 24:34.211
It's not healthy,
Danny, and you know it.

24:34.213 --> 24:35.746
What about Sean and Jack?

24:35.748 --> 24:37.048
Hmm?

24:37.050 --> 24:41.118
You want them to live in
anger and denial because...

24:41.120 --> 24:44.255
because you can't get over it?

24:45.158 --> 24:49.260
I just don't know how.

24:49.262 --> 24:52.763
Very small steps.

24:52.765 --> 24:55.733
And if I can't?

24:56.636 --> 25:00.638
If you can't,
you lean on your family.

25:00.640 --> 25:05.042
Linda's the one
I always lean on.

Hey.

This is Bryce.

25:35.341 --> 25:36.941
This is Jamie.
He's a friend of mine.

25:36.943 --> 25:38.042
He's cool.

25:38.044 --> 25:40.044
Hey.
I've never seen you here.

25:40.046 --> 25:40.945
I've never seen you either.

25:40.947 --> 25:42.647
He just wants to score
some Molly.

25:42.649 --> 25:44.215
He looks like a cop.

25:44.217 --> 25:46.050
That's funny. I was thinking
you look like a criminal.

25:46.052 --> 25:47.385
Give him a toss.

25:47.387 --> 25:48.653
What?

25:48.655 --> 25:49.654
You have a problem with that?

25:49.656 --> 25:50.955
I think we should
take our business

25:50.957 --> 25:52.023
someplace else.

25:52.025 --> 25:53.290
I think you're a little jumpy.

25:53.292 --> 25:55.793

your guy was cool.

you looking to score?

to catch up.

26:15.615 --> 26:16.747
Maybe we can go and have

26:16.749 --> 26:18.349
a drink together.
Why don't you take a hike.

26:18.351 --> 26:19.850
Yeah, this is
really not a good time.

26:19.852 --> 26:20.918
Never is a good time.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.053
All right?

26:22.055 --> 26:24.388

26:25.224 --> 26:27.558

That's good news
for Olivet's defense.

27:05.565 --> 27:07.264
Unfortunately, it
came after the media

27:07.266 --> 27:09.200
had beaten him
up pretty good.

27:09.202 --> 27:10.768
He resigned.

27:10.770 --> 27:13.604
Oh, you didn't tell me
he resigned.

27:13.606 --> 27:15.272
Collateral damage.

27:16.142 --> 27:18.442
Things'll get better.

27:22.081 --> 27:24.482
I'm on my third mayor, Pop.

27:24.484 --> 27:26.584
I think I'm used up.

27:26.586 --> 27:28.552
I don't think we need
two of us sitting here

27:28.554 --> 27:30.688
worrying about Danny.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.690
Is he back yet?

27:32.692 --> 27:34.859
Came in the front door
and went straight upstairs.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.827
No dinner,
no chitchat,

27:36.829 --> 27:38.462
no nothing.

27:38.464 --> 27:41.465
He should be down here
with his boys.

27:44.370 --> 27:46.737
Of all my kids,

27:46.739 --> 27:49.039
I think he's the most like me.

27:49.041 --> 27:53.511
When we lost Mary,
you checked out completely.

27:53.513 --> 27:55.946
I was stuck in quicksand.

27:55.948 --> 27:58.949
I remember.

27:59.786 --> 28:02.353
You know what got me out?

28:02.355 --> 28:03.387
Work?

28:03.389 --> 28:05.055
Purpose?

28:07.727 --> 28:10.761
<font color="#FF5500">(sighs)</font>

28:10.763 --> 28:15.166
My kids became my purpose.

28:23.943 --> 28:25.743
What are you doing?

28:25.745 --> 28:28.345
I got Judge Barton
to sign a subpoena

28:28.347 --> 28:30.214
for Weber's phone and computer.

28:30.216 --> 28:31.348
Based on what?

28:31.350 --> 28:32.750
Well, based on the fact
that Weber's

28:32.752 --> 28:36.187
a person of interest in his
ex-girlfriend's disappearance.

28:36.189 --> 28:37.988
This was signed
at 2:00 a.m.

28:37.990 --> 28:40.891
Yeah. Judge Barton, you know,
he likes to play bridge

28:40.893 --> 28:42.526
until all hours of the night.

28:42.528 --> 28:45.663
Oh, and he also does have
a taste for good Scotch.

28:45.665 --> 28:47.298
How much did that
set you back?

28:47.300 --> 28:48.299
You don't want to know.

28:48.301 --> 28:49.667
So, what have you got?

28:49.669 --> 28:52.269
Well, seems Weber didn't have
his cell phone turned on

28:52.271 --> 28:54.905
the morning Jack was stabbed, so
I couldn't track him that way.

28:54.907 --> 28:56.473
But he does have a ZipPoint.

28:56.475 --> 28:56.983
A ZipPoint?

28:57.007 --> 28:59.054
Yeah, it's to help you find
your car if it was stolen

28:59.078 --> 29:00.511
or if you can't remember
where you parked.

29:00.513 --> 29:02.246
Kind of like a mini GPS.

29:02.248 --> 29:05.316
The ZipPoint puts his vehicle
at the scene.

29:05.318 --> 29:07.685
It's still not
enough to arrest.

29:07.687 --> 29:09.320
No, it's not enough to arrest,
but it is enough

29:09.322 --> 29:11.121
to get a warrant
for Weber's house.

29:12.525 --> 29:16.093
Which is exactly what
we're gonna do.

in the right places.

30:43.959 --> 30:46.159
The mayor said
you can go right in.

30:57.839 --> 31:00.840
Commissioner Reagan,
thank you for coming.

31:00.842 --> 31:01.975
"Frank" will do fine.

31:01.977 --> 31:03.476
Close the door, have a seat.

31:16.391 --> 31:18.224
I read the autopsy report.

31:18.226 --> 31:19.893
Mm.
She was

31:19.895 --> 31:21.528
clearly under the influence.

31:21.530 --> 31:23.163
To put it mildly.

31:23.165 --> 31:24.431
Well, how would you put it?

31:24.433 --> 31:27.400
Officer Olivet was trying
to reason with someone

31:27.402 --> 31:29.169
who had snorted enough jet fuel

31:29.171 --> 31:31.838
to win the ninth race
at Belmont.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.174
I'm not going to pressure
the DA's office

31:34.176 --> 31:37.177
to pursue any criminal charges

31:37.179 --> 31:40.280
against Officer Olivet.

31:43.185 --> 31:45.185
There's something
you should know

31:45.187 --> 31:46.753
about police officers.

31:46.755 --> 31:49.823
Oh, I think I know...
Hold on.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.691
Okay.

31:51.693 --> 31:55.195
They know what people
are capable of

31:55.197 --> 31:58.732
in ways that most,
thankfully, do not.

31:58.734 --> 32:01.835
They have seen firsthand
the cigarette burns

32:01.837 --> 32:04.304
on an infant's back
or the black eyes

32:04.306 --> 32:06.606
and the sideways jaw

32:06.608 --> 32:09.542
on an 80-year-old
rape victim.

32:09.544 --> 32:12.812
And they assume the worst.

32:12.814 --> 32:15.081
And they take that on

32:15.083 --> 32:18.351
so that good people
can go about their lives

32:18.353 --> 32:22.188
and think generously
about their fellow man.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.592
They provide that luxury.

32:26.628 --> 32:29.195
You say that as if it's a fact.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.731
It is to me.

32:31.733 --> 32:34.567
And a hard-earned one.

32:34.569 --> 32:36.970
And whoever is in my office,
he or she,

32:36.972 --> 32:39.139
if they're any good,
is gonna feel the same way.

32:39.141 --> 32:43.610
My job is to advocate
for the people.

32:44.913 --> 32:47.414
And if that calls
for an investigation

32:47.416 --> 32:51.284
into your department
or any of your officers,

32:51.286 --> 32:54.387
it's not personal.
It's going to happen.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.123
Because of your rush
to judgment,

32:57.125 --> 32:59.993
this city has lost
a good police officer

32:59.995 --> 33:01.928
as surely and as finally

33:01.930 --> 33:05.098
as if he were killed
in the line of duty.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.067
I didn't ask you here to argue

33:07.069 --> 33:10.003
the-the finer points
of the shooting.

33:10.005 --> 33:13.773
I called you in here
to apologize.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.880
As it turns out,
I can't fire you.

33:20.882 --> 33:24.184
Really?

33:24.186 --> 33:26.386
I didn't know that.

33:28.223 --> 33:32.058
I guess I could just resign.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.328
Your polling numbers are higher

33:35.330 --> 33:38.798
than any mayor's in memory.

33:40.068 --> 33:42.168
Oh, don't pay any attention
to those.

33:42.170 --> 33:44.537
<font color="#FF5500">(chuckling)</font>:
Why do you say that?

33:44.539 --> 33:48.575
They don't poll the folks
who we put behind bars.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.646
But I'm kind of like one of
those last century buildings

33:53.648 --> 33:57.117
you fought to save when you were
on the landmark commission.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.618
How's that?

33:58.620 --> 34:01.121
Oh, people walk by me every day

34:01.123 --> 34:04.791
and I look like an anachronism
against all the glass and steel,

34:04.793 --> 34:07.761
but tear me down...

34:07.763 --> 34:10.830
all of a sudden, I'm beloved.

34:15.203 --> 34:17.837
That's it? We're done?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.306
I am.

34:23.110 --> 34:26.846
Do you want to stay on the job?

34:26.848 --> 34:29.415
Only if I'm wanted.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.417
Madam Mayor.

34:31.418 --> 34:33.920
Good day.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.090
Maggie.

34:40.929 --> 34:43.096
Maggie.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.436
<font color="#FF5500">(sighs)</font>

34:50.438 --> 34:51.804
You found our body.

34:51.806 --> 34:54.306
Yep. Crime scene has it.

34:54.309 --> 34:56.109
You'll be able
to put him away.

34:56.110 --> 34:57.844
Thank you.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.380
How is Jack?

35:00.382 --> 35:03.149
He's gonna make it.

35:04.286 --> 35:07.287
Somehow I feel guilty
about that.

35:07.289 --> 35:09.189
Don't.
You were right.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.958
I asked you to work this case
so you were too busy

35:11.960 --> 35:14.093
to even think about Linda.

35:14.095 --> 35:16.496
Yeah.

35:16.498 --> 35:19.299
Wasn't too hard to figure
that one out.

35:19.301 --> 35:23.436
Trouble is, all I do
is think about Linda, anyway.

35:23.438 --> 35:25.004
Maybe you should
think about

35:25.006 --> 35:28.007
what Linda would say if you told
her you were gonna quit.

35:28.009 --> 35:30.476
I know what she'd say.

35:30.478 --> 35:32.312
She'd be ecstatic.

35:32.314 --> 35:34.914
<font color="#FF5500">(laughing)</font>:
No, she wouldn't.

35:34.916 --> 35:37.517
You would have
driven her insane at home.

35:37.519 --> 35:39.619
What are you gonna do?

35:39.621 --> 35:42.121
You suck at fishing,
you hate golf.

35:42.123 --> 35:44.858
What you're good at is the job.

35:44.860 --> 35:48.528
The job doesn't need me anymore.

35:48.530 --> 35:51.497
Well, maybe you need the job.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.902
Will you just think about it?

35:59.307 --> 36:01.140
Yeah.

36:01.142 --> 36:05.545
And if you ever need
a shoulder to cry on...

36:05.547 --> 36:07.413
Call Jamie?

36:08.283 --> 36:11.184
Exactly.

36:31.506 --> 36:33.573
Come on, Danny.
Just take a minute, man.

36:33.575 --> 36:36.142
No. You said you were
gonna drop me off.

36:36.144 --> 36:37.443
It's one little stop.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.545
Yeah, well, I don't feel
like socializing.

36:39.547 --> 36:41.414
Come on. It's Pop's friend,
Mrs. Ginty, all right?

36:41.416 --> 36:43.116
She hasn't seen us since
we were kids. I promised.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.884
Great. Then we'll send her
a picture.

36:44.886 --> 36:47.186
Get out of the car now.

What's going on?

37:11.546 --> 37:13.579
Wait till you see the game room.
The what?

37:13.581 --> 37:15.248
It's not a game room,
it's a man cave.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.917

This is your new home.

38:28.189 --> 38:30.723
I don't know what to say.

Okay.

38:41.569 --> 38:45.071
<font color="#FF5500">(sighs)</font>
I did read an obit a while back.

38:45.073 --> 38:48.341
When you reach a certain age,
you do that sort of thing.

38:49.978 --> 38:52.045
And someone said,

38:52.047 --> 38:56.249
"We are all just passing time.

38:56.251 --> 39:00.086
And occupy our chair
very briefly."

39:03.291 --> 39:07.894
The time we had with Linda
was a gift.

39:09.431 --> 39:11.230
And we are all the better

39:11.232 --> 39:15.535
that she occupied her chair...

39:15.537 --> 39:18.671
so well.

39:20.675 --> 39:22.942

Some say

39:22.944 --> 39:26.879
we have more than
our share of loss.

39:28.616 --> 39:32.418
But I see God's light
in this family every day.

39:32.420 --> 39:34.954
And though I may not
understand it,

39:34.956 --> 39:38.391
I trust in His plan for us all.

39:42.764 --> 39:45.298
When Mary died...

39:47.102 --> 39:50.903
When I lost my wife...

39:50.905 --> 39:53.272
I was a mess.

39:53.274 --> 39:55.842
And it was my kids...

39:55.844 --> 39:58.211
Joe, Erin,

39:58.213 --> 40:00.079
Jamie,

40:00.081 --> 40:04.016
and Danny, who...

40:04.018 --> 40:07.753
even though they
had lost their mom...

40:09.557 --> 40:13.459
always made sure,
each in their own way,

40:13.461 --> 40:16.395
to be there for me.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.032
I'm not sure

40:20.034 --> 40:22.368
what a shrink would say
about that.

40:24.139 --> 40:26.906
But it was appreciated.

I'd like to say it.
