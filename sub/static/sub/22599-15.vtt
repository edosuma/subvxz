[SCREAMS]

21:21.448 --> 21:23.408
[MOANING]

21:27.329 --> 21:29.164
Time to go.

21:34.753 --> 21:38.298
Thank you for your help, Batman.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.175
Before you depart, I must know.

21:40.425 --> 21:43.262
How did you really deduce my identity?

21:43.512 --> 21:45.055
Everyone knows who you are.

21:46.265 --> 21:49.017
You're the world's greatest detective.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.187
Indeed.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.439
And what of Craddock?

21:55.357 --> 21:59.069
I daresay he won't be causing
any more trouble for humanity.

21:59.319 --> 22:02.239
The jury will make sure of that.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.289
GENTLEMAN GHOST:
No matter how many centuries...

22:10.289 --> 22:12.582
...I have to wait to face you, Batman...

22:12.833 --> 22:15.168
...I will find you again...

22:15.419 --> 22:19.381
...and I will have my revenge.
