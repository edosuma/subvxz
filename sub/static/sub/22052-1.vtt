09:33.467 --> 09:35.467
Wait, are you guys so excited?
'Cause I am.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.467
>> KOURTNEY: We're going to the
land.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.100
>> KHLOE: To the land down
under.

09:39.100 --> 09:42.567
>> KIM: The land and beyond.
>> KHLOE: My family and everyone

09:42.567 --> 09:45.467
coming to Cleveland is working
out perfectly, because we have

09:45.467 --> 09:49.000
time to enjoy Cleveland and not
be a distraction to Tristan in

09:49.000 --> 09:51.800
any way.
He is on the road and then he

09:51.800 --> 09:54.633
gets back the last night
before everybody leaves.

09:54.633 --> 09:57.867
So he gets to see everybody
and... just, everything's

09:57.867 --> 09:59.900
working out perfectly.
Tristan is like, "Where are they

09:59.900 --> 10:01.433
staying?"
And I was like, "Why do you care

10:01.433 --> 10:03.100
so much?"
And he was like, "I just want

10:03.100 --> 10:05.100
everybody to want to come back
a second time.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.100
So I want everything to be so
nice."

10:07.100 --> 10:08.800
>> MALIKA: He's just being a
sweetheart.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.800
I'm sure we'll be fine and
nothing will keep us from coming

10:10.800 --> 10:12.800
to visit you.
>> KHLOE: It was like, "Oh, my

10:12.800 --> 10:14.900
God."
>> KIM: Wait, so you guys.

10:14.900 --> 10:17.600
I'm looking online.
So, like, things are coming out

10:17.600 --> 10:19.667
about Caitlyn's book.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah?

10:19.667 --> 10:22.300
>> KIM: And it says, "Caitlyn
Jenner reveals she has now

10:22.300 --> 10:25.000
undergone gender reassignment
surgery."

10:25.000 --> 10:28.066
>> KOURTNEY: Stop.
So that means they snipped?

10:28.066 --> 10:30.066
>> KIM: Yeah, they snipped.
But, like, why couldn't she say

10:30.066 --> 10:33.767
that to us?
I... Like, we would understand.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.367
She makes it, woe is me,
woe is me.

10:36.367 --> 10:38.467
>> KHLOE: I'm the victim.
I'm this, and...

10:38.467 --> 10:40.967
They don't want to see me.
It's like, (bleep) off.

10:40.967 --> 10:43.900
And it's not 'cause you're
trans; that's not why I'm not

10:43.900 --> 10:45.734
talking to you.
I'm not talking to you

10:45.734 --> 10:49.767
because you're a bad, mean
person.

10:49.767 --> 10:53.433
>> KIM: I just don't get why
you would go to the trouble of

10:53.433 --> 10:56.533
giving me a book, and saying,
"Here's my book, I want you to

10:56.533 --> 10:58.800
read it."
Clearly, she gave me a

10:58.800 --> 11:01.467
different book with everything
edited out that she didn't

11:01.467 --> 11:04.700
want us to see.
It's just again, that, like...

11:04.700 --> 11:06.200
>> KOURTNEY: It's just...
>> KIM: ...fakeness.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.567
>> KOURTNEY: ...the personality
just doesn't vibe with ours.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.533
>> KHLOE: I wonder what the
weather's like.

11:11.533 --> 11:14.467
Weirdly, it said it was gonna
be, like, 75 when I checked,

11:14.467 --> 11:17.734
but it was snowing on Friday.

35:13.066 --> 35:16.800
Oh, look, you guys, there are so
many Kanyes in here.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.800
(Khloe gasps)
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.800
Oh, my God.
(bleating)

35:20.800 --> 35:22.600
Best day of my life.
>> KOURTNEY: Where are we going

35:22.600 --> 35:24.600
next?
>> KIM: Alien Invasion.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.467
>> KHLOE: Alien Invasion!
>> KOURTNEY: Alien Invasion!

35:26.467 --> 35:30.767
Everyone, if you don't go on
Alien Invasion, you're not a

35:30.767 --> 35:33.100
part of the crew anymore.
(man laughs)

35:33.100 --> 35:35.867
Just get on the ride.
>> KHLOE: There's, like, a whole

35:35.867 --> 35:38.100
new Kourt ever since she's not
been with Scott, and I love it.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.100
>> KIM: Totally.
Unrecognizable.

35:40.100 --> 35:41.934
>> KHLOE: Like, a way lighter,
fun.

35:41.934 --> 35:44.200
She's, like, bullying people
into going on all the rides.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.467
Like, she's just, like, down for
whatever.

35:46.467 --> 35:48.333
>> KOURTNEY: Are we doing the
Gravitron?

35:48.333 --> 35:50.166
>> KHLOE: Yeah!
>> KOURTNEY: You're such a

35:50.166 --> 35:51.934
(bleep) idiot if you don't get
on.

35:51.934 --> 35:53.767
Why aren't you doing it?
>> STEPHANIE: I'm not a dropper.

35:53.767 --> 35:55.600
>> KOURTNEY: It's just a quick
drop.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.867
It's like you're falling in
love.

35:58.867 --> 36:02.400
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God.
Kim, we won't charge you for the

36:02.400 --> 36:06.433
Kimojis.
Kimberly!

36:06.433 --> 36:09.800
(screaming)
>> STEPHANIE: Look at Tristan's

36:09.800 --> 36:11.800
face.
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, my God.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.700
Let's do it again.

36:15.934 --> 36:21.700
>> KHLOE: Tristan. Really?
Oh, damn!

36:21.700 --> 36:23.600
Babe.

36:24.700 --> 36:31.000
>> STEPHANIE: Yeah!
(laughing)

36:31.000 --> 36:35.533
>> KIM: We really do miss Khloe,
and just knowing that so much of

36:35.533 --> 36:39.066
her life is here in Cleveland
is, you know, just hard to

36:39.066 --> 36:41.700
accept.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah. I think it's

36:41.700 --> 36:44.100
just bittersweet, you know?
Like, I'm happy for her that

36:44.100 --> 36:48.734
she's with Tristan, but then,
it's just sad that she's, like,

36:48.734 --> 36:51.433
definitely not coming back
anytime soon.

36:51.433 --> 36:53.333
(laughter)

36:59.100 --> 37:00.734
>> KHLOE: I just want to say
thank you guys so much for

37:00.734 --> 37:03.033
coming to Cleveland.
I appreciate you guys taking

37:03.033 --> 37:06.567
time away from your kids and
being here for me and seeing,

37:06.567 --> 37:09.266
like, an experience of my life.
>> KOURTNEY: You are living life

37:09.266 --> 37:13.000
over here.
>> KHLOE: Seriously, thank you.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.300
Like, you guys to come all the
way to Cleveland...

37:15.300 --> 37:17.900
You don't owe me anything, and
you don't need to come here.

37:17.900 --> 37:20.133
I appreciate that, and I'm sure
Tristan appreciates that.

37:20.133 --> 37:21.934
>> TRISTAN: Very much so.
>> KHLOE: And thank you, and

37:21.934 --> 37:23.934
that's all.
>> STEPHANIE: Oh.

37:23.934 --> 37:26.233
>> KIM: Aw.
I'm definitely sad that Khloe's

37:26.233 --> 37:29.767
gone, but Khloe and Tristan are
really cute together.

37:29.767 --> 37:31.767
Like, she's got a good crew over
there.

37:31.767 --> 37:33.900
She's got a good support system.
>> KOURTNEY: We know she's safe.

37:33.900 --> 37:36.066
We don't have to worry.
She's in good hands.

37:36.066 --> 37:37.900
>> KIM: Yeah.
>> KOURTNEY: And I feel like

37:37.900 --> 37:40.633
we're all living our lives and
doing our own thing, so let her

37:40.633 --> 37:42.467
live hers.
>> KIM: Let her live. Yeah.

37:42.467 --> 37:44.300
>> KOURTNEY: We're here for you.
>> KHLOE: I wish you guys would

37:44.300 --> 37:46.133
come to a game, but that will be
next time.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.667
>> KOURTNEY: I know. I can't
believe we didn't stay an extra

37:47.667 --> 37:49.667
day.
>> KIM: A game?

37:49.667 --> 37:51.467
>> KHLOE: A basketball game.
You know.

37:51.467 --> 37:53.266
>> KOURTNEY: There's a game
tomorrow.

37:53.266 --> 37:54.934
>> KIM: Basketball? Why?
>> TRISTAN: You know, play a

37:54.934 --> 37:56.934
little... little rubber ball
here and there.

37:56.934 --> 38:00.333
>> KOURTNEY: You can't say we
didn't live life today.

38:00.333 --> 38:02.333
(laughs) Did it.
>> KHLOE: Bye.

38:02.333 --> 38:15.300
>> KIM: Good-bye.
>> KHLOE: I love you.

38:15.300 --> 38:21.400
(Kendall sniffles)
>> KENDALL: Hi.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.567
>> KIM: What's wrong?
>> KENDALL: Someone calls me

38:24.567 --> 38:26.633
with more bad news, like, every
five minutes.

38:26.633 --> 38:30.300
It's just so stressful.
>> KIM: How are you doing with,

38:30.300 --> 38:33.533
like, things in the book-- how
it says she did the gender

38:33.533 --> 38:35.533
reassignment surgery and all
that?

38:35.533 --> 38:38.367
>> KENDALL: She told Kylie and I
before the book came out.

38:38.367 --> 38:40.467
>> KIM: Okay.
>> KENDALL: What upsets me the

38:40.467 --> 38:43.066
most is that Dad brought up the
commercial without even me

38:43.066 --> 38:44.900
saying anything.
>> KIM: And I called her and

38:44.900 --> 38:46.734
said, "Don't say anything."
>> KENDALL: I know, I remember.

38:46.734 --> 38:48.734
>> KIM: Like, I was so...
Couldn't have been more clear.

38:48.734 --> 38:52.233
>> KENDALL: Yeah.
My dad brought up the commercial

38:52.233 --> 38:54.600
in her interview.
>> MAN: Caitlyn Jenner said she

38:54.600 --> 38:57.100
watched her daughter's
controversial commercial.

38:57.100 --> 39:00.433
She notes that Kendall is a
model, and they hired her to go

39:00.433 --> 39:03.567
do this, adding that Kendall
saw the script beforehand and

39:03.567 --> 39:05.567
thought it was fine.
>> KENDALL: My dad doesn't

39:05.567 --> 39:08.233
actually know what happened,
and so the fact that she's

39:08.233 --> 39:10.233
gonna act like she, like...
>> KIM: "Kendall knew."

39:10.233 --> 39:12.066
>> KENDALL: Yeah.
>> KIM: "Kendall saw the...

39:12.066 --> 39:13.800
She read the script."
>> KENDALL: She didn't even...

39:13.800 --> 39:15.533
She wouldn't know if I had known
or not.

39:15.533 --> 39:17.333
>> KIM: Yeah.
>> KOURTNEY: Like, she was not

39:17.333 --> 39:19.133
in the works of it or behind the
scenes of it at all.

39:19.133 --> 39:21.667
>> KIM: Yeah.
>> KENDALL: She has no idea, and

39:21.667 --> 39:24.834
she just, like, word-vomits.
>> KIM: It's like, you're not

39:24.834 --> 39:26.867
the person to, like, have this
conversation.

39:26.867 --> 39:29.000
You're gonna make it worse, so
please leave it alone.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.667
>> KENDALL: Yeah.
>> KIM: And they didn't.

39:32.667 --> 39:35.000
>> KENDALL: I just feel really,
really bad.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.200
Like, I feel really bad that
anyone was ever offended.

39:38.200 --> 39:42.633
I feel really bad that this was
taken s-such a wrong way.

39:42.633 --> 39:46.166
And I genuinely feel like
(bleep).

39:46.166 --> 39:49.734
And I have no idea how I'm gonna
bounce back from it.

39:49.734 --> 39:52.166
Like, I don't even know what to
do.

39:52.166 --> 39:54.066
Like, my, uh...

40:06.400 --> 40:08.400
>> KENDALL: I just feel really,
really bad.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.700
Like, I feel really bad that
anyone was ever offended.

40:11.700 --> 40:15.467
I feel really bad that this was
taken s-such a wrong way.

40:15.467 --> 40:17.600
And I genuinely feel like
(bleep).

40:17.600 --> 40:20.967
And I have no idea how I'm gonna
bounce back from it.

40:20.967 --> 40:25.567
Like, I don't even know what to
do.

40:25.567 --> 40:27.900
>> KIM: This is the first time
you've had a scandal.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.066
It's, like, your first...
This is your first real

40:30.066 --> 40:32.066
experience with something like
this.

40:32.066 --> 40:33.934
>> KENDALL: Yeah, but it's a
very bad one.

40:33.934 --> 40:35.700
>> KIM: A very bad one.
>> KENDALL: Like, it's not like

40:35.700 --> 40:37.300
it's, like, a little scandal...
>> KIM: And, like, you were...

40:37.300 --> 40:39.000
>> KENDALL: ...that'll, like, go
away.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
>> KIM: Like, this is-- it's
okay.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.333
Like, people...
>> KENDALL: Everyone was like--

40:44.333 --> 40:46.700
every-- like, the text messages
I would get from people-- they'd

40:46.700 --> 40:49.900
be like, "It's gonna be fine,
like, you know everything blows

40:49.900 --> 40:53.467
over in, like, a week's time" or
whatever, and I'm just like,

40:53.467 --> 40:56.667
"Okay, but it's been, like,
three weeks and it's not going

40:56.667 --> 40:58.800
anywhere."
>> KIM: Yeah, but it will,

40:58.800 --> 41:05.266
and... this is just gonna be the
biggest lesson learned for you.

41:05.266 --> 41:07.433
>> KENDALL: But I-I really don't
even know what to do at this

41:07.433 --> 41:09.667
point.
Like, it's really depressing,

41:09.667 --> 41:13.300
and it bothers me every single
day because I'm like...

41:13.300 --> 41:15.967
>> KIM: Well, I know you're so
sensitive and I know that you

41:15.967 --> 41:19.834
never would have, like, ever...
You're the last person to want

41:19.834 --> 41:22.500
to hurt someone or be
insensitive, but it's, like, it

41:22.500 --> 41:24.834
really sucks.
I think the only thing you can

41:24.834 --> 41:28.066
really do is, like, just be,
like, real and honest, because

41:28.066 --> 41:31.800
you can't ignore it.
Like, you can't.

41:31.800 --> 41:34.467
It should affect you in a way
where you grow from it, and

41:34.467 --> 41:38.867
you're like, "Okay, I'm a better
person."

41:38.867 --> 41:41.233
>> KENDALL: Yeah.
>> KIM: You know?

41:41.233 --> 41:44.633
But I just wish that you could
see that there's light at the

41:44.633 --> 41:47.300
end of the tunnel.
>> KENDALL: Yeah.

41:47.300 --> 41:49.400
>> KIM: And that it will be okay
if you're just, like, honest and

41:49.400 --> 41:56.100
open.
>> KENDALL: Mm-hmm.

41:56.100 --> 41:58.000
(Kendall sniffles)

41:59.200 --> 42:02.800
I would never purposely hurt
someone, ever, and I would...

42:02.800 --> 42:05.400
Obviously, if I knew that this
was gonna be the outcome, like,

42:05.400 --> 42:07.266
I would have never done
something like this, but you...

42:07.266 --> 42:09.500
you don't know when you're in
the moment, and, like...

42:09.500 --> 42:11.500
(sniffles)
It was the most...

42:11.500 --> 42:14.867
Like, it was...
Like, it was so...

42:14.867 --> 42:18.066
Like, I just felt so (bleep)
stupid.

42:18.066 --> 42:20.867
The fact that I would offend
other people or hurt other

42:20.867 --> 42:26.100
people was definitely not the
intent, and that's what, that's

42:26.100 --> 42:30.200
what got me the most, is that I
would have ever made anyone else

42:30.200 --> 42:34.633
upset.
>> KIM: I'm always here.

42:34.633 --> 42:37.500
I've been through it.
>> KENDALL: I appreciate it a

42:37.500 --> 42:39.934
lot.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.266
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

42:44.266 --> 42:47.967
>> KIM: MILFs gone wild.
(whooping and laughter)

42:47.967 --> 42:50.333
Let's cue the cute music.
>> KOURTNEY: This is not your

42:50.333 --> 42:52.900
job.
>> KRIS: What is wrong with you?

42:52.900 --> 42:55.100
>> KHLOE: It's just, like, fun
to (bleep) with her.

42:55.100 --> 42:57.533
(blows)
>> KIM: I've never seen anything

42:57.533 --> 42:59.800
like this.
It's just, like, heartbreaking.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.333
>> KRIS: Why would the
restraining order have to do

43:02.333 --> 43:05.266
with his amount of custody?
>> KOURTNEY: I've given up on

43:05.266 --> 43:07.333
being with the person that I
have three kids with.

43:07.333 --> 43:08.867
>> KHLOE: Do you have a
boyfriend now?

43:08.867 --> 43:11.333
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: Kim is now so

43:11.333 --> 43:13.467
insecure.
>> KIM: Why did I come?

43:13.467 --> 43:15.333
>> SCOTT: I definitely am out of
control.

43:15.333 --> 43:19.600
>> KOURTNEY: When is it going to
be enough?

43:19.600 --> 43:22.133
>> KRIS: In our family you never
know what you're going to get.

43:22.133 --> 43:24.133
>> KHLOE: Guess who's coming
home, kid.

43:24.133 --> 43:28.467
(cheering)
>> KIM: What happens every time

43:28.467 --> 43:30.934
I say "Guess what"?
>> KHLOE: Pregnant or the-the

43:30.934 --> 43:33.500
person's pregnant.
>> KIM: We're having a baby.

43:33.500 --> 43:36.000
