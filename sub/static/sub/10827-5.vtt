-I couldn't sleep the night
before my first

00:26.336 --> 00:27.441
transformation, either.

00:29.926 --> 00:32.860
-I feel like I'm about
to explode.

00:32.894 --> 00:35.552
-There's nothing to
be scared of.

00:35.587 --> 00:36.726
You'll be right here with us.

never speak.

To my grave the secret goes.

beating heart.

MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]: The
Isle of Lindisfarne, as I

01:18.181 --> 01:21.598
express in my book, "Resources
and Religion on Medieval

01:21.633 --> 01:24.222
Lindisfarne," has always
been a sentry.

01:24.256 --> 01:28.226
A magic safe haven, as it is cut
off from the outside world

01:28.260 --> 01:31.263
from most of the day, which
why we have timed

01:31.298 --> 01:33.265
our visit so carefully.

01:41.756 --> 01:42.481
-Maddy!

01:42.516 --> 01:43.413
Rhydian!

01:43.448 --> 01:44.380
Come on, how old are you?

01:44.414 --> 01:45.933
Calm down.

01:45.967 --> 01:46.899
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]: All
right, Kay, Katrina, come on.

01:46.934 --> 01:47.555
-What's up with you, Mads?

01:47.590 --> 01:48.349
-Nothing.

01:48.384 --> 01:49.557
I'm just excited.

01:49.592 --> 01:50.731
-What's everyone doing
when we get back?

01:50.765 --> 01:52.146
My mums just hatched
some chicks.

01:52.181 --> 01:54.217
They are so fluffy you
have to see them.

01:54.252 --> 01:55.149
-Sorry, Shan.

01:55.184 --> 01:55.874
-I'm going round Maddy's.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.496
-Oh, yeah?

01:57.531 --> 01:59.464
-Mom's making a family tree,
finding out about Rhydian's

01:59.498 --> 02:00.637
side of the family.

02:00.672 --> 02:01.500
-Oh!

02:01.535 --> 02:01.949
-Oh, the black sheep.

02:01.983 --> 02:02.570
Ha, ha.

02:02.605 --> 02:03.502
Ha.

02:03.537 --> 02:04.779

02:06.367 --> 02:07.575
Off we go.

02:07.610 --> 02:10.233
Lindisfarne Castle was
built around 15--

02:10.268 --> 02:14.858
1550 using stones from the
abandoned monastery.

02:14.893 --> 02:18.379
-Which may explain why the
castle is haunted.

TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Haunt--

02:19.691 --> 02:20.485
MISS FITZGERALD [OFFSCREEN]:
Imagine you're

02:20.519 --> 02:22.003
a Lindisfarne monk.

02:22.038 --> 02:26.318
Armed men are riding down
the causeway to attack.

02:26.353 --> 02:29.425
You run inside the monastery,
a place of

02:29.459 --> 02:30.909
safety, a sacred place.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.739
No one would dare
harm you here.

02:33.774 --> 02:35.293
You lock yourself inside.

02:35.327 --> 02:36.604
Only trapped to yourself.

02:36.639 --> 02:38.951
You have to get out.

-That night in the cellar
is not looking too

02:46.821 --> 02:48.685
good now, is it?

02:48.720 --> 02:50.825
-It's gonna be horrible.

02:50.860 --> 02:53.207
I don't know how my
parents do it.

02:53.242 --> 02:54.691
-How are we gonna do it?

02:54.726 --> 02:56.383
-They're up here.

02:56.417 --> 02:57.936
Aw, you two missed
the best bit.

02:57.970 --> 02:58.833
Monks were getting their
heads chopped off.

02:58.868 --> 03:00.904
It was brilliant.

03:00.939 --> 03:02.423
-Ah, there you are.

03:02.458 --> 03:07.497
Oh, dear, we're rather high
up here, aren't we?

03:07.532 --> 03:12.330
Um, I got a bit carried away
down there, I'm--I'm sorry.

03:12.364 --> 03:13.676
-It wasn't you, Miss.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.470
-Claustrophobia.

03:14.504 --> 03:15.643
-I understand that.

03:15.678 --> 03:18.715
The Imagination is
far more powerful

03:18.750 --> 03:20.683
than the logical brain.

03:20.717 --> 03:23.789
We know there's no danger
stood on a roof or in a

03:23.824 --> 03:26.447
crowded room, but, um, still--

03:26.482 --> 03:29.381
-So what do we do, Miss, when
you need to get in some place

03:29.416 --> 03:32.729
and instinct tells you it's
too scary to even try?

03:32.764 --> 03:36.802
-If I knew the answer to that,
Maddy, I would feel a lot

03:36.837 --> 03:38.666
better stood on this roof.

03:38.701 --> 03:41.359
See you downstairs when
you're ready.

03:41.393 --> 03:42.981
-Didn't know claustrophobia
was catching.

03:48.883 --> 03:54.441
-OK, people, the questions cover
the castle, the lime

03:54.475 --> 03:59.584
kilns, together with the
church and the priory.

03:59.618 --> 04:03.104
So for those of you who have
been paying attention, this

04:03.139 --> 04:05.348
should be very easy.

04:05.383 --> 04:10.422
And there is a prize for the
most correct answers.

04:10.457 --> 04:14.771
And remember to be back at the
mini bus by 5 o'clock, without

04:14.806 --> 04:18.774
fail, or we will
miss the tide.

04:18.810 --> 04:19.810
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Come on.

04:19.845 --> 04:21.468
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]:
All right.

04:21.502 --> 04:26.300
-Right, well we know questions
12 to 15, so we just need to

04:26.335 --> 04:30.373
answer three questions in the
village, two in the lime kiln,

04:30.408 --> 04:32.686
four in the priory, and
two on the beach.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.032
-OK.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.447
Then you two take the church
and the village and

04:35.482 --> 04:36.137
we'll do the rest.

04:36.172 --> 04:37.000
Sort it.

04:37.035 --> 04:37.932
-But, we're a team.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.486
We're not supposed to be--

04:39.520 --> 04:40.487
-Oh, Jeff--Jeffries doesn't care
how we get the answers,

04:40.521 --> 04:42.040
as long as we get good marks.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.110
-And if we finish fast enough,
we'll have time to go for ice

04:43.144 --> 04:43.938
cream.

04:43.973 --> 04:45.112
-Aw, yeah, brilliant!

04:45.146 --> 04:46.941
All right, so we'll meet
you both at the

04:46.976 --> 04:48.115
priory later, yeah?

04:58.436 --> 05:00.921
-This would be a brilliant
place to spend full moon.

05:00.955 --> 05:02.094
-Here?

05:02.129 --> 05:03.095
-Yeah.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.511
On an island.

05:04.545 --> 05:05.891
What could be safer?

05:05.926 --> 05:09.999
Running on the beaches,
playing in the ruins.

05:10.033 --> 05:11.690
-It would be amazing.

05:11.725 --> 05:14.348
-So let's do it.

05:14.383 --> 05:15.694
-Rhydian, [sigh]

05:15.729 --> 05:16.833
I can't.

05:16.868 --> 05:18.628
My parents are expecting
us home.

05:18.663 --> 05:21.838
-Yeah, to share that
cozy little den.

05:21.873 --> 05:24.738
-This is my first
transformation.

05:24.772 --> 05:26.118
I want to be with me family.

05:26.153 --> 05:28.466
And you promised you'd spend
full moon with her.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.813
So there's nothing else to
talk about, is there?

05:39.891 --> 05:41.202
-Idiots, ahoy.

05:41.237 --> 05:42.514
What are you doing, Jimi?

05:42.549 --> 05:44.067
Steeling the crab's
lunch money?

05:44.102 --> 05:44.965
-Haven't got any.

05:44.999 --> 05:46.035
They're feeling the pinch.

05:46.069 --> 05:46.932
[laughing]

05:46.967 --> 05:48.140
-I tell you what.

05:48.175 --> 05:50.591
I'll settle for your
worksheet answers.

05:50.626 --> 05:51.730
Help yourself.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.011
-It's blank.

05:57.046 --> 05:58.737
Go fetch, bleat boy.

05:58.772 --> 06:01.015
[laughing]

06:01.050 --> 06:02.085
-On your way.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.018
Go on, go and get
it, bleat boy.

06:04.053 --> 06:05.088
Ha, ha.

06:05.123 --> 06:06.642
SAM [OFFSCREEN]: Good
throw, Jimi.

06:06.676 --> 06:07.712
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: He'll
change his mind.

06:07.746 --> 06:08.644
SAM [OFFSCREEN]: What's
he going up there for?

06:08.678 --> 06:09.886
LIAM [OFFSCREEN]: Good
luck with that.

06:09.921 --> 06:11.440
Watch him, he's going to fall.

06:11.474 --> 06:12.682
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: Ask me,
he's kind of an idiot.

06:12.717 --> 06:13.614
SAM [OFFSCREEN]: I'm gonna
watch him fall.

06:13.649 --> 06:14.201
He's gonna take a tumble.

06:14.235 --> 06:15.409
Look at him.

06:15.444 --> 06:16.030
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]:
Such an idiot.

06:16.065 --> 06:17.446
He's gonna fall.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.033
-Come on, Rhydian, we don't
have time for this.

06:19.068 --> 06:20.518
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: Yeah,
listen to her, man.

06:20.552 --> 06:20.966
SAM [OFFSCREEN]: Shake it.

06:21.001 --> 06:21.864
Shake!

06:21.898 --> 06:23.210
He's gonna fall.

06:23.244 --> 06:23.866
Watch him.

06:23.900 --> 06:24.936
Watch him.

06:27.145 --> 06:28.905
-Rhydian!

06:28.940 --> 06:29.527
-Ugh!

06:29.561 --> 06:30.804
-Rhydian!

06:30.838 --> 06:32.944
Don't move him, he might
have broken a bone.

06:32.978 --> 06:34.221
Just go get help.

06:34.255 --> 06:35.636
Go!

06:35.671 --> 06:36.465
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: Um,
out of my way, Liam.

06:36.499 --> 06:37.017
Sam, where are you?

06:37.051 --> 06:38.432
-Are you OK?

06:38.467 --> 06:39.088
-Yeah.

06:39.122 --> 06:39.847
-Where does it hurt?

06:39.882 --> 06:42.160
-My ankle.

06:42.194 --> 06:43.023
-Surprise, surprise.

06:43.057 --> 06:44.542
No Rhydian, no Maddy.

06:44.576 --> 06:47.786
Probably smooching on
the beach somewhere.

06:47.821 --> 06:49.616
-Right, we have two competing
theories.

06:49.650 --> 06:51.928
One, they're dating,
and two she's--

06:51.963 --> 06:53.240
-Roar!

06:53.274 --> 06:54.897
-What we need is evidence.

06:54.931 --> 06:58.038
So from now on, we stick to them
like glue, on the bus, at

06:58.072 --> 06:59.280
school, after school.

06:59.315 --> 07:01.524
Everywhere they go,
we're there.

07:01.559 --> 07:03.250
Either we'll find some evidence,
or they get so fed

07:03.284 --> 07:04.872
up with us they have
to start talking.

07:04.907 --> 07:05.735
Agreed?

07:05.770 --> 07:07.047
-Agreed.

07:07.081 --> 07:08.151
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: You
need to get to the bus.

07:08.186 --> 07:09.118
You can still get
off the island.

07:09.152 --> 07:09.981
-And leave you on your own?

07:10.015 --> 07:11.189
-I won't be on my own.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.742
One of the teachers
will stay with me.

07:12.777 --> 07:14.951
The other one will get you home
before the moon rises.

07:14.986 --> 07:17.229
-You can't transform with a
teacher staying with you.

07:17.264 --> 07:18.645
-I'll be fine.

07:18.679 --> 07:19.749
Just get off the island
while you still can.

07:19.784 --> 07:21.026
-I'm not going anywhere.

07:21.061 --> 07:22.821
I'm going to make sure
you get through this.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.203
-Maddy, if you want to transform
with your parents

07:25.237 --> 07:26.100
you have to go now.

07:26.135 --> 07:28.309
-I can't leave you here.

07:28.344 --> 07:30.208
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: Ugh!

07:30.242 --> 07:31.209
-Rhydian's hurt.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.004
He fell off a roof.

07:33.038 --> 07:34.764
-Keep everyone on the coach.

07:34.799 --> 07:36.490
-Tom, Shannon, sit down.

07:36.525 --> 07:37.560
-But, Miss!

07:37.595 --> 07:39.217
-Let Mr. Jeffries
deal with it.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.011
-Maddy, I'm fine.

07:40.045 --> 07:41.322
Go.

07:41.357 --> 07:43.186
She has to go home, sir.

07:43.221 --> 07:43.946
-It's all right.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.154
Now don't worry.

07:45.188 --> 07:46.051
We're all going to get
home tonight, Don't

07:46.086 --> 07:46.949
you worry about that.

07:46.983 --> 07:48.019
OK.

07:48.053 --> 07:48.951
It doesn't appear
to be broken.

07:48.985 --> 07:50.504
Jimi, take his other arm.

07:50.539 --> 07:51.609
-But the tide, sir.

07:51.643 --> 07:52.955
-It's all right.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.888
I told you to be back at the
bus 15 minutes early.

07:54.922 --> 07:58.270
If we hurry up, we can
still make it.

07:58.305 --> 08:01.860
Maddy, come on.

08:01.895 --> 08:02.551
OK?

08:02.585 --> 08:03.034
You all right?

08:03.068 --> 08:03.759
-Yeah.

08:03.793 --> 08:04.587
-OK.

08:04.622 --> 08:05.657
Come on up, up we go.

08:05.692 --> 08:06.589
Up we go.

08:06.624 --> 08:07.728
All right.

08:07.763 --> 08:09.316
It's all right everyone,
don't panic.

08:09.350 --> 08:09.937
It's OK.

08:09.972 --> 08:10.869
You OK?

08:10.904 --> 08:11.560
-Yeah.

08:11.594 --> 08:12.112
-You all right?

08:12.146 --> 08:13.216
In Jimi, in.

08:16.703 --> 08:18.152
Get us moving.

08:18.187 --> 08:19.982
MISS FITZGERALD [OFFSCREEN]:
Please get me off the island.

08:29.578 --> 08:30.371
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
All right.

08:30.406 --> 08:31.890
Just calm down, everyone.

08:37.136 --> 08:38.172
Everyone calm down.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.312
-Yeah.

08:40.347 --> 08:42.245
-Next low tide, midnight.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.073

There's no way

08:43.107 --> 08:44.109
out tonight, folks.

08:46.353 --> 08:47.250
-All right, quiet.

08:47.285 --> 08:49.736
All right, quiet please.

08:49.770 --> 08:52.014
I've spoken to the head teacher,
and we've taken the

08:52.048 --> 08:54.637
decision that we're going
to stay here overnight.

08:54.672 --> 08:57.571
Now we're going to go back first
thing in the morning.

08:57.606 --> 09:01.333
Luckily, the hotel can squeeze
us all in, yay!

09:01.368 --> 09:04.129
But it's going to be three
or four to a room.

09:04.164 --> 09:06.062
So gather up your
things, please.

09:06.097 --> 09:07.823
We'll allocate you a room.

09:07.857 --> 09:09.997
-Operation stick like glue.

09:10.032 --> 09:10.929
Sure, right.

09:10.964 --> 09:12.275
We've lost Maddy already.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.898
-Rhydian can't walk.

09:13.932 --> 09:16.003
We're stuck on an island, and
my best mate already thinks

09:16.038 --> 09:18.730
I'm the beast of Stoneybridge
Moor.

09:18.765 --> 09:19.973
-Look, don't panic.

09:20.007 --> 09:21.802
Rhydian will be fine
once he transforms.

09:21.837 --> 09:24.391
The full moon heals almost
anything in a wolfblood.

09:24.425 --> 09:27.877
But you both have to be out
of the village by 8:30.

09:27.912 --> 09:29.292
-Wish we had never come here.

09:29.327 --> 09:31.605
I'd give anything to
be back at home.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.987
-Maybe we could get
to you by boat.

09:34.021 --> 09:36.023
-How would you explain
that to the teachers?

09:36.058 --> 09:38.716
You wouldn't get here by
8:30 unless you can

09:38.750 --> 09:40.096
paddle with your paws.

09:40.131 --> 09:41.857
-Listen, Maddy, you and Rhydian
are going to have to

09:41.891 --> 09:43.099
think your way out of this.

09:43.134 --> 09:45.170
The two of you, you're
on your own now, pet.

09:45.205 --> 09:47.621
But whatever you do, make
sure you get out of

09:47.656 --> 09:48.795
the village in time.

09:59.875 --> 10:02.774
-Not exactly luxurious,
but you really

10:02.809 --> 10:04.707
can't manage the stairs.

10:04.742 --> 10:06.088
-I'll be fine, Miss.

10:06.122 --> 10:07.227
Thanks.

10:11.265 --> 10:12.681
Private room.

10:12.715 --> 10:14.821
Job done.

10:14.855 --> 10:18.445
-Can I, uh, give you
a hand with that?

10:18.479 --> 10:20.861
-Yeah, cool.

10:20.896 --> 10:21.690
MISS FITZGERALD [OFFSCREEN]:
Right.

10:21.724 --> 10:22.725
There you go, girls.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.453
[laughing]

10:26.487 --> 10:27.765
-So I'll go in there.

10:27.799 --> 10:28.973
-Um, nope.

10:29.007 --> 10:30.699
That's reserved for,
uh, another guest.

10:30.733 --> 10:33.149
You have to go in
with the K's.

10:33.184 --> 10:34.081
Maddy, go.

10:34.116 --> 10:35.255
Go on.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.138
-Oh, look!

10:56.172 --> 10:57.242
It's Rhydian's girlfriend.

10:57.277 --> 10:58.519
-I'm not his girlfriend.

10:58.554 --> 11:00.107
-He fell because he was
showing off to you.

11:00.142 --> 11:01.488
-Which means it's your fault
we're stuck on the Isle of

11:01.522 --> 11:02.903
Lindisfarne with no pj's.

11:02.938 --> 11:03.801
-Nor cleansers.

11:03.835 --> 11:05.941
-And no clean underwear.

11:05.975 --> 11:07.287
-It's not my--

11:07.321 --> 11:09.358
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: Oh, great,
it's allergy girl.

11:18.954 --> 11:20.852
[sneezing]

11:27.410 --> 11:31.207
-Hey, Mads, this house has
a room downstairs.

11:31.242 --> 11:32.381
Let's go look.

11:39.906 --> 11:42.529
I think we should complain.

11:42.563 --> 11:43.841
Poor animals.

11:53.816 --> 11:54.955
Maddy?

11:56.577 --> 11:57.820
-Where have you been?

11:57.855 --> 11:59.270
-I couldn't get rid
of Shannon.

11:59.304 --> 12:01.444
-Yeah, Tom was in here
being all matey.

12:01.479 --> 12:02.929
They know something's up.

12:02.963 --> 12:04.793
How are you going to get out
without missing you?

12:04.827 --> 12:06.518
Shannon will think I'm
with three K's.

12:06.553 --> 12:07.865
I'll tell the three K's
I've moved back

12:07.899 --> 12:08.831
into Shannon's room.

12:08.866 --> 12:09.798
She'll think I'm with them.

12:09.832 --> 12:10.557
They'll think I'm with her.

12:10.591 --> 12:11.592
Simples.

12:11.627 --> 12:12.939
And then I'll help
get you out.

12:12.973 --> 12:13.525
-Help me?

12:13.560 --> 12:14.872
Oh, my leg.

12:14.906 --> 12:16.425
Yeah, I really wouldn't
worry about that.

12:16.459 --> 12:18.427
-Mom says it'll heal
once you transform.

12:18.461 --> 12:20.981
We both need to get out of
the village by 8:30.

12:21.016 --> 12:21.948
-OK.

12:21.982 --> 12:22.845
We should leave separately.

12:22.880 --> 12:23.812
Meet at the boat sheds?

12:23.846 --> 12:26.504
-OK.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.126
-Look.

12:28.161 --> 12:29.093
It'll be OK.

12:29.127 --> 12:31.198
I've done this loads of times.

12:31.233 --> 12:32.165
-Twice.

12:32.199 --> 12:33.787
-OK, twice.

12:33.822 --> 12:35.409
But it will be all
right, Maddy.

12:35.444 --> 12:38.481
I'll look after you.

12:38.516 --> 12:44.142
-The ghost dog of Lindisfarne,
only last year, a young couple

12:44.177 --> 12:49.009
wandering near Lindisfarne
Castle came across the

12:49.044 --> 12:53.842
entrance to the abandoned
lime mine.

12:53.876 --> 13:00.814
Inside they heard a strange,
unearthly howl.

13:00.849 --> 13:03.265
Thinking it was a dog that had
got trapped in one of the

13:03.299 --> 13:08.132
tunnels, foolishly went
inside to investigate.

13:08.166 --> 13:08.926
Little did they know--

13:08.960 --> 13:10.444
[clock chimes]

13:10.479 --> 13:12.170
MISS FITZGERALD [OFFSCREEN]:
--they were entering the lair

13:12.205 --> 13:18.073
of the ghostly white
dog of Lindisfarne.

13:18.107 --> 13:19.453
And they were never
going to come out.

13:19.488 --> 13:21.524
For the next day, their friends
went in search of

13:21.559 --> 13:23.250
them, but the couple
had disappeared.

13:23.285 --> 13:27.876
All they found were
the mobile phones.

13:27.910 --> 13:30.844
On one was a recording,
a terrible

13:30.879 --> 13:33.088
snarling, and screams.

13:33.122 --> 13:34.917
As if the couple had
been attacked by

13:34.952 --> 13:36.850
some sort of monster.

13:36.885 --> 13:38.127
[gasps]

13:38.162 --> 13:38.990
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Officially, the

13:39.025 --> 13:40.681
case remains unsolved.

13:40.716 --> 13:47.619
Unofficially they blame the
white dog of Lindisfarne.

13:47.654 --> 13:49.345
All right.

13:49.380 --> 13:51.451
Who's got another good--

13:51.485 --> 13:52.521
-I'm just going to--

13:52.555 --> 13:53.418
-Oh, me, too.

13:53.453 --> 13:55.179
-What's wrong with you?

13:55.213 --> 13:56.697
-Nothing.

13:56.732 --> 13:58.561
-Well, you've been following us
around like James Bond on a

13:58.596 --> 13:59.355
mission.

13:59.390 --> 14:00.287
-Just hanging out.

14:00.322 --> 14:01.910
That's what mates do.

14:01.944 --> 14:05.051
-If you were really my friend,
you'd just back off and give

14:05.085 --> 14:06.190
me some space.

14:13.369 --> 14:14.992
-No cleanser, no toner.

14:15.026 --> 14:16.683
My skin's gonna end up
worse than yours.

14:20.583 --> 14:21.688
Where you going?

14:21.722 --> 14:23.932
-Um, moving to Shannon's room.

14:23.966 --> 14:25.174
-Good riddance.

14:25.209 --> 14:29.040
Don't need geek in a
powder room anyway.

14:29.075 --> 14:31.698
-Maddy?

14:31.732 --> 14:33.182
Maddy!

14:33.217 --> 14:34.356
Maddy!

14:37.773 --> 14:39.499
Maddy.

14:39.533 --> 14:41.673
Maddy?

14:41.708 --> 14:42.640
-Oh, no.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.746
A geek convention.

14:45.781 --> 14:47.300
[knocking]

14:47.334 --> 14:48.611
Maddy.

14:48.646 --> 14:50.510
[knocking]

14:55.964 --> 14:57.586
-She's moved into your
room, lame brain.

15:01.141 --> 15:02.280
-No, she hasn't.

15:21.990 --> 15:23.750
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Going somewhere, Tom?

15:23.784 --> 15:25.131
-No, sir, I was just going--

15:37.833 --> 15:39.110
-Maddy's disappeared.

15:41.009 --> 15:44.391
-Guess what, Rhydian's
like to, too.

15:44.426 --> 15:46.566
-That's it.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.568
I'm going to find them.

15:48.602 --> 15:51.157
And I'm going to get
some answers.

15:51.191 --> 15:52.054
Coming?

15:52.089 --> 15:53.228
-Oh, yes.

17:12.652 --> 17:14.550
[growling]

18:29.246 --> 18:32.145
[wolf howling]

18:32.180 --> 18:35.838
-Did hear that ghost story that
Miss Fitzgerald told?

18:35.873 --> 18:37.461
-I don't think that
was a ghost.

18:41.810 --> 18:44.675
It's a full moon.

18:44.709 --> 18:45.745
Maddy's changed.

18:45.779 --> 18:47.643
-You're kidding me?

18:47.678 --> 18:49.956
You've got to be
kidding, right?

18:49.990 --> 18:50.922
Shannon.

18:50.957 --> 18:54.650
[wolf howling]

18:54.685 --> 18:55.858
-She's on the beach.

18:55.893 --> 18:57.136
Let's go.

19:11.219 --> 19:12.289
[wolf howling]

19:12.323 --> 19:13.324
-That's the lime kilns.

19:13.359 --> 19:14.843
-The haunted lime kilns?

19:14.877 --> 19:17.949
The white dog from Lindisfarne
lime kilns?

19:17.984 --> 19:19.641
-We've got her now, come on.

19:23.852 --> 19:25.302
[growling]

19:29.927 --> 19:31.031
-Look, see there's nothing her.

19:31.066 --> 19:31.894
Great.

19:31.929 --> 19:32.550
Can we go now please?

19:41.697 --> 19:42.836
-Paw prints.

19:46.668 --> 19:47.772
Come on, Tom.

19:49.843 --> 19:51.224
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Is
this a good idea?

19:51.259 --> 19:52.536
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Don't
be such a baby.

19:52.570 --> 19:54.469
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Ugh!

19:54.503 --> 19:55.332
It's cold and dark.

19:55.366 --> 19:56.298
Look, we need to go.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.437
There's nothing here, Shan.

20:01.476 --> 20:05.721
Ugh, it's wet.

20:05.756 --> 20:06.860
-This way.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.842
-What was that?

20:22.876 --> 20:24.015
-Relax.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.819
[wolf howling]

20:34.854 --> 20:35.682
-Did you hear that?

20:35.717 --> 20:36.821
We've got her now.

20:41.447 --> 20:42.758
-Please, Shan, let's go.

20:50.835 --> 20:52.285
There's nothing here.

21:01.743 --> 21:02.675
[growling]

21:02.709 --> 21:04.021
[scurrying]

21:04.055 --> 21:06.610
-What's that noise?

21:06.644 --> 21:07.542
Agh!

21:07.576 --> 21:09.475
Ugh!

21:09.509 --> 21:10.614
-Ugh!

21:13.720 --> 21:14.652
-Ugh!

21:14.687 --> 21:17.931
It's the ghost dog!

21:17.966 --> 21:19.623
-There's no such thing
as ghosts.

21:19.657 --> 21:22.419
-Well, what do you think
knocked us over, Shan?

21:22.453 --> 21:23.109
-It was Maddy.

21:23.143 --> 21:24.386
-Huh?

21:26.802 --> 21:29.149
You saw it, right?

21:29.184 --> 21:30.634
[whimpering]

21:38.607 --> 21:40.540
MISS FITZGERALD [OFFSCREEN]:
Anyone not in bed in 30

21:40.575 --> 21:42.404
seconds gets extra homework!

21:48.928 --> 21:50.412
[knocking]

21:54.589 --> 21:55.728
-Where were you last night?

21:58.040 --> 21:58.834
-What?

21:58.869 --> 21:59.697
-Shannon has this idea--

21:59.732 --> 22:00.560
-You were there, Tom.

22:00.595 --> 22:01.389
You know I'm right.

22:01.423 --> 22:03.770
-Right about what?

22:03.805 --> 22:05.565
-Maddy was out all night.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.015
And you went with her.

22:07.049 --> 22:11.053
We followed the sound of the
howling to the lime kiln.

22:11.088 --> 22:13.021
And there was something there.

22:13.055 --> 22:13.815
We think--

22:13.849 --> 22:14.954
-You think.

22:17.646 --> 22:20.511
-I think Maddy changed
last night.

22:20.546 --> 22:21.961
Became something else.

22:21.995 --> 22:24.170
And you know about it.

22:24.204 --> 22:25.620
-What are you talking about?

22:25.654 --> 22:28.381
-Something knocked Tom over,
and it wasn't human.

22:28.416 --> 22:33.041
-Well, it could have been a dog,
a fox, or it could have

22:33.075 --> 22:35.181
been a bunch of local
kids who thought you

22:35.215 --> 22:37.079
were that ghost dog.

22:37.114 --> 22:38.529
It could have been anything.

22:38.564 --> 22:40.428
-Then where was Maddy
all night?

22:40.462 --> 22:41.601
-Well, I've got an idea.

22:41.636 --> 22:44.501
Let's ask her.

22:44.535 --> 22:45.640
-Fine.

22:49.713 --> 22:50.645
[knocking]

22:50.679 --> 22:52.060
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Open up!

22:52.094 --> 22:53.682
-Go away, loser.

22:53.717 --> 22:54.890
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]:
I'm coming in.

22:54.925 --> 22:55.788
-No!

22:55.822 --> 22:57.065
-Don't come in.

22:57.099 --> 22:59.895
-We don't have any makeup on.

22:59.930 --> 23:00.620
-Where's Maddy?

23:00.655 --> 23:01.552
-Don't ask us.

23:01.587 --> 23:03.416
-Haven't seen her all right.

23:03.451 --> 23:03.865
Ugh!

23:03.899 --> 23:04.590
Boys!

23:04.624 --> 23:05.107
Get them out.

23:12.494 --> 23:14.013
-Oh, there you are.

23:14.047 --> 23:15.670
-Well, you didn't think
I was going to share

23:15.704 --> 23:17.050
with them, did you?

23:17.085 --> 23:20.019
I sneaked downstairs, spent
the night on the sofa.

23:20.053 --> 23:21.469
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: We can
still hear you.

23:21.503 --> 23:22.815
-Where did you go with
Rhydian last night?

23:22.849 --> 23:25.818
-Me and Rhydian went
on a walk.

23:25.852 --> 23:26.957
His leg was hurting.

23:32.618 --> 23:33.791
I can smell bacon.

23:33.826 --> 23:35.448
Does anyone want to
come to breakfast?

23:35.483 --> 23:36.276
-Me.

23:36.311 --> 23:37.554
I could eat a whole pig.

23:40.557 --> 23:41.696
-You coming?

23:45.700 --> 23:48.081
-Home sweet home, OK, come on.

23:48.116 --> 23:48.668
-Sir.

23:48.703 --> 23:50.014
-Um, hm.

23:50.049 --> 23:51.153
-You never gave out the prize
for the worksheet.

23:51.188 --> 23:53.086
-That is a very good
point, Jimi.

23:53.121 --> 23:54.743
I'll tell you what, let's
call it a draw.

23:54.778 --> 23:56.745
Everybody wins.

23:56.780 --> 23:59.161
Take one and hand them out.

23:59.196 --> 24:00.508
Save one for Miss Fitzgerald.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.233
-Yeah.

24:02.268 --> 24:04.132
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: They're
so going out.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.547
-They're lying.

24:05.582 --> 24:07.273
They have to be.

24:07.307 --> 24:08.688
You know there was something
up there.

24:08.723 --> 24:10.483
-Ah, Rhydian was right.

24:10.518 --> 24:12.002
Only just a stray dog.

24:12.036 --> 24:12.727
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Tom!

24:12.761 --> 24:13.762
-It was dark.

24:13.797 --> 24:15.902
All those ghost stories.

24:15.937 --> 24:18.042
Use your Occum's Razor thing.

24:18.077 --> 24:19.906
The simplest explanation wins.

24:19.941 --> 24:22.046
Rhydian disappeared,
Maddy disappeared.

24:22.081 --> 24:23.979
They're dating.

24:24.014 --> 24:26.257
Simplest explanation, right?

24:26.292 --> 24:29.088
-Maybe.

24:29.122 --> 24:31.918
-That was amazing.

24:31.953 --> 24:34.576
I so get it now.

24:34.611 --> 24:37.821
Being a wolfblood is
gonna be so great.

24:37.855 --> 24:38.960
Come on.

24:45.932 --> 24:49.932
