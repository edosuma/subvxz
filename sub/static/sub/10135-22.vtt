07:33.203 --> 07:34.704
My pleasure.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.874
We never clean at my house.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.376
We move in, trash the place

07:39.418 --> 07:41.253
for five years,

07:39.418 --> 07:41.253
then move out.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.505
Okay, here we go.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.757
Just check in here.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.471
Ha.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.931
Well..

07:52.973 --> 07:54.724
...what do we have here?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.728
Yes, what do we have here?

08:00.563 --> 08:01.773
Man, it's just a little soot.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.985
[scoffs]

08:01.815 --> 08:04.985
Just a little soot?

08:05.026 --> 08:06.361
Did you hear that, Michelle?

08:06.403 --> 08:08.571
I'm afraid I did.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.741
You know, I've been making

08:09.906 --> 08:11.741
random inspections

08:11.783 --> 08:13.285
of every room in the house

08:11.783 --> 08:13.285
and so far

08:13.327 --> 08:15.203
I've found the following,

08:13.327 --> 08:15.203
mold, mildew

08:15.245 --> 08:16.537
fungus, soap scum.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.207
[gasps]

08:16.579 --> 08:19.207
Not soap scum.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.751
- Yes, soap scum.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.751
- Ooh!

08:22.377 --> 08:23.878
Guys, come on.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.713
Once a year I ask you

08:23.920 --> 08:25.713
all to roll up your sleeves

08:25.755 --> 08:27.132
and really do a job

08:25.755 --> 08:27.132
on this house.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.216
Now, if you're gonna do a job

08:28.258 --> 08:29.426
you gotta give it 100%.

08:29.468 --> 08:30.802
Otherwise, let's not

08:29.468 --> 08:30.802
do a job at all.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.304
Hey, let's not

08:30.844 --> 08:32.304
do the job at all.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.514
- Sounds good.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.514
- 'Oh, come on.'

08:34.555 --> 08:36.808
I know you don't mean that.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.353
You all take as much pride

08:36.850 --> 08:39.353
in a clean house as I do.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.396
Now, let's get back

08:39.394 --> 08:41.396
out there and really clean.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.940
And when you're all done, I got

08:41.438 --> 08:43.940
a special surprise for you.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.942
You're taking us

08:43.982 --> 08:45.942
to Happy Mountain?

08:45.984 --> 08:47.819
No, it's even better

08:45.984 --> 08:47.819
than that, honey.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.114
I'm putting new shelf paper

08:47.861 --> 08:51.114
in all of your closets.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.491
Yay!

08:54.159 --> 08:55.285
What?

08:57.287 --> 08:59.373
[instrumental music]

09:01.249 --> 09:02.667
Everyone, come in.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.667
I have to tell you something.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.793
- What?

09:02.709 --> 09:03.793
- Come on.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.045
What is it?

09:06.587 --> 09:10.050
Is it just me, or is Dad

09:06.587 --> 09:10.050
worse than ever this year?

09:10.091 --> 09:11.385
Hey, there's nothin' wrong

09:10.091 --> 09:11.385
with your dad

09:11.426 --> 09:13.053
wanting to be little clean.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.139
Alright, wanting to be

09:14.262 --> 09:16.139
very clean.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.228
Alright, he's a psycho

09:17.682 --> 09:21.228
with a dust mop.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.731
It's not just the cleaning.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.731
He gets so carried away.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.650
He's the only parent who packs

09:24.772 --> 09:27.650
a coaster in your lunch.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.737
What about all his rules?

09:30.778 --> 09:34.241
Does it really matter if you

09:30.778 --> 09:34.241
chew each bite of food 24 times?

09:34.282 --> 09:36.451
Yesterday, I only did it 22

09:36.493 --> 09:39.829
and let me tell you,

09:36.493 --> 09:39.829
it felt good.

09:39.871 --> 09:43.041
Well, your dad does like

09:39.871 --> 09:43.041
to pay attention to detail.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.626
Every detail,

09:43.083 --> 09:45.626
on every subject..

09:45.668 --> 09:47.670
...in the universe.

09:47.712 --> 09:48.838
What drives you crazier?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.007
His-his stories or his rambles?

09:51.049 --> 09:52.342
What's the difference?

09:53.427 --> 09:54.677
Here you are.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.137
Did we forget today

09:56.179 --> 09:57.931
that it was spring-cleaning?

09:59.391 --> 10:00.600
That's another thing.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.935
He turned our

10:00.641 --> 10:01.935
sweet little Michelle

10:01.976 --> 10:04.271
into a junior neat freak.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.813
Michelle, do you really care

10:04.312 --> 10:05.813
if the inside

10:05.855 --> 10:07.023
of the chimney is clean?

10:07.065 --> 10:09.776
Yes, I do.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.776
And so does Santa Claus.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.821
She's totally brainwashed.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.698
Everything should be washed.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.867
Now let's get busy!

10:19.702 --> 10:23.123
Poor kid.

10:19.702 --> 10:23.123
She's really turning into Dad.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.666
Yeah, before you know it,

10:23.164 --> 10:25.666
she's gonna start rambling.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.335
Making up crazy rules.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.296
Making stupid schedules.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.048
The last thing we need

10:29.337 --> 10:32.048
around here is another Danny.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.883
- Yeah, I hear you.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.883
- Yeah.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.182
[instrumental music]

10:53.069 --> 10:55.029
Dad's coming down.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.073
Line up for inspections.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.994
Do we line up by size,

10:57.115 --> 11:00.994
alphabetically or by age?

11:01.035 --> 11:04.080
IQ. Joey, you're at the end

11:01.035 --> 11:04.080
of the line.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.458
Okay, everybody stand up

11:04.122 --> 11:06.458
straight and look clean.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.211
Ready for inspection,

11:07.959 --> 11:10.211
O Prince of Tidiness.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.008
Here's your white glove.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.635
Uh, I won't be needing

11:15.049 --> 11:16.635
that, honey.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.261
There's not gonna be

11:16.675 --> 11:18.261
any inspection.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.180
No inspection?

11:20.221 --> 11:22.599
Dad, we just cleaned

11:20.221 --> 11:22.599
for four hours.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.351
Well, thanks, but, uh..

11:24.392 --> 11:26.019
Look, I'm gonna take

11:24.392 --> 11:26.019
a little drive

11:26.060 --> 11:28.229
up to the mountains and just

11:26.060 --> 11:28.229
do some thinking, okay.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.981
So I'll be back later.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.566
You guys just

11:30.023 --> 11:31.566
have a nice day.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.569
[instrumental music]

11:37.905 --> 11:39.949
[water gurgling]

11:41.742 --> 11:44.996
Atta boy, Norman.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.996
You're doing great.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.208
Boy, the guy at the Rent-A-Burro

11:45.038 --> 11:48.208
place was right.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.169
I'm glad I sprang

11:48.249 --> 11:51.169
for the midsize. Alright.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.047
Keep going.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.047
Alright! You made it.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.298
Good boy!

11:56.341 --> 11:57.342
Ooh.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.593
Oh, yeah.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.887
Oh, this feels great.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.763
I'm gonna start riding

12:00.928 --> 12:02.763
a burro to work every day.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.893
Oh, man,

12:04.558 --> 12:06.893
would you look at that.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.020
Come here, Norman.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.065
Right there is fine.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.065
That's fine.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.820
You know..

12:17.862 --> 12:19.614
...I've had a lot of time

12:17.862 --> 12:19.614
to think today.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.326
Oh, man,

12:20.907 --> 12:23.326
what an eye opener.

12:24.619 --> 12:27.414
You should've been

12:24.619 --> 12:27.414
in that closet with me.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.208
People I love most in the world

12:27.455 --> 12:30.208
think I'm nothing but a..

12:30.250 --> 12:33.752
...compulsive, neurotic,

12:30.250 --> 12:33.752
rambling jackass.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.088
No offense.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.092
How did I get

12:37.340 --> 12:39.092
so messed up?

12:40.051 --> 12:42.303
Guess it goes

12:40.051 --> 12:42.303
back to my mom.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.180
On my 5th birthday,

12:42.345 --> 12:44.180
she gave me my own

12:44.222 --> 12:46.182
set of vacuum cleaner

12:44.222 --> 12:46.182
attachments.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.644
She used to call me

12:47.975 --> 12:49.644
her special helper.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.855
Oh, my God.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.191
That's exactly

12:52.897 --> 12:55.191
what I'm doing to Michelle.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.444
She-she's probably

12:55.233 --> 12:57.444
gonna grow up and..

12:57.485 --> 13:00.405
...write one of those tell all

12:57.485 --> 13:00.405
books, "Daddy Cleanest."

13:03.366 --> 13:06.077
I-I gotta make some

13:03.366 --> 13:06.077
changes in my life.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.163
Norman, thanks

13:06.119 --> 13:09.163
for listening to me, buddy.

13:09.205 --> 13:12.292
I guess you get a lotta guys

13:09.205 --> 13:12.292
who come here just to talk, huh?

13:12.333 --> 13:13.585
Hey, if you're ever

13:12.333 --> 13:13.585
in San Francisco

13:13.627 --> 13:15.503

13:13.627 --> 13:15.503
some cappuccino okay?

13:16.795 --> 13:18.131
[sighs]

13:18.172 --> 13:20.425
Isn't this view amazing?

13:20.467 --> 13:21.968
Oh, man.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.137
Nature is just so beautiful.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.097
[inhales]

13:26.139 --> 13:28.891
It's so...so natural.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.394
And yet...so dirty.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.814
Look at this.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.814
Th-there's dirt everywhere.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.692
Look, look at

13:35.856 --> 13:37.692
this mountain, Norman.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.153
It's-It's just one

13:37.734 --> 13:40.153
big pile of dirt.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.574
But do you animals care

13:41.696 --> 13:44.574
if the forest isn't vacuumed?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.701
I saw what you did on

13:44.616 --> 13:46.701
the trail back there, Norman.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.750
For you guys, nature is just one

13:50.871 --> 13:53.750
big restroom, isn't it?

13:55.293 --> 13:56.586
[sighs]

13:56.628 --> 13:57.962
You know what?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.464
From now on..

13:59.506 --> 14:02.133
...there's gonna be

13:59.506 --> 14:02.133
a new Danny Tanner.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.637
Somebody who everybody likes

14:02.175 --> 14:05.637
and they wanna be around.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.222
Norman, it's the dawn

14:05.679 --> 14:08.222
of a new man.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.890
Yeah, natural.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.811
Spontaneous, carefree..

14:27.033 --> 14:28.785

14:28.827 --> 14:31.538
Come on, i-it's very simple,

14:28.827 --> 14:31.538
it's right hand, left knee.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.040
Left hand, right knee.

Very simple. Let's take off.

Oh, what a good boy.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.638
I wanna see my kids crawl.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.348
Is that too much to ask

14:48.680 --> 14:50.348
for a father?

- Jess, look!

- What?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.945
like little Slinkies.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.781
Now we're gonna have

15:04.987 --> 15:06.781
to baby proof the house.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.282
That's alright,

15:06.823 --> 15:08.282
we'll dig their gates out.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.535
Good going, boys, alright!

15:10.577 --> 15:11.952
You're such a good boy.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.329
Hey, you guys, do some laps

15:11.994 --> 15:13.329
around the playpen

15:13.371 --> 15:15.456
till we make this place

15:13.371 --> 15:15.456
safe for you.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.624
Dad's back.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.626
Yeah, we just saw him pull up.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.795
I'm home!

15:20.837 --> 15:22.589
- Danny.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.589
- Hi, how you doing?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.215
- Whoa.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.845
Dad, someone has to say it.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.054
You don't smell good.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.891
Honey, I-I smell like nature.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.017
Like the mountains

15:32.932 --> 15:35.017
and the trees.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.562
You smell like

15:35.059 --> 15:37.562
a donkey to me.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.064
But, hey, it's just great

15:37.604 --> 15:40.064
to have you back.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.358
[coughing]

15:42.400 --> 15:44.360
Yeah, don't worry about it.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.779
There we go.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.115
Danny, aren't you gonna

15:47.113 --> 15:49.115
pick that up?

15:49.156 --> 15:51.158
Sure, next time

15:49.156 --> 15:51.158
I go out.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.745
You see, everybody,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.745
I've changed all my priorities.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.204
You can say goodbye

15:53.787 --> 15:55.204
to Captain Clean

15:55.246 --> 15:56.664
because from now on..

15:56.706 --> 15:58.625
...I'm gonna live

15:56.706 --> 15:58.625
my life totally natural.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.918
Hmm. Naked?

16:01.628 --> 16:05.172
Oh, great, potato chips.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.172
Thank you. I'm starved.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.966
Mmm. Thank you.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.011
Who the heck is that guy?

16:18.018 --> 16:21.272
A man works up a powerful

16:18.018 --> 16:21.272
thirst riding a burro.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.608
Dad, you're drinking

16:21.314 --> 16:23.608
from the milk carton.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.443
You said that was illegal.

16:26.694 --> 16:30.072
Well, the new law is,

16:26.694 --> 16:30.072
hey, it's cool.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.827
Danny, were you kidnapped

16:31.741 --> 16:33.827
by the Grateful Dead?

16:39.624 --> 16:42.502
Hey, who's the

16:39.624 --> 16:42.502
tall dirty guy?

16:42.543 --> 16:43.586
[sniffs]

16:43.628 --> 16:46.005
Who smells like a donkey?

16:46.046 --> 16:47.632
<i>Hola,</i> Gibblerito.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.342
Is that really you?

16:49.383 --> 16:51.719
I'll find out

16:49.383 --> 16:51.719
if it's the real him.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.931
The real Danny Tanner

16:51.761 --> 16:54.931
would not tolerate

16:54.973 --> 16:57.057
a nice glop of chocolate

16:57.099 --> 16:59.143
on his nice clean refrigerator.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.688
There you go.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.315
What do you say to that?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.483
What do I say to that?

17:07.401 --> 17:09.236
I say, hey, it's cool.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.239
Okay, yeah,

17:10.864 --> 17:12.239
that-that's fine.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.325
But so what if

17:12.281 --> 17:14.325
somebody a little

17:14.367 --> 17:15.702
less mature came along

17:15.743 --> 17:18.371
and turned that

17:15.743 --> 17:18.371
little glop of chocolate

17:18.412 --> 17:21.541
into a smiley face, huh?

17:24.502 --> 17:25.962
Daddy, do something!

17:26.004 --> 17:28.756
Joey's makin' a mess!

17:28.798 --> 17:30.299
I'll do something.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.551
I'll add some hair.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.969
There we go.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.472
Alright. Perfect.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.224
I'll find out if

17:36.514 --> 17:38.224
it's for real.

17:48.693 --> 17:52.238
Okay, Mr. T, have a cow

17:48.693 --> 17:52.238
and toss my rear out of here.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.616
Oh, Kimmy, I love

17:53.447 --> 17:55.616
your high jinks.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.662
Daddy, you're scaring me.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.623
Oh, don't worry, honey.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.792
Your dad's just

18:02.665 --> 18:04.792
a fun-loving guy.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.836
Not some psycho

18:04.834 --> 18:06.836
with a dust mop.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.256
Come on, everybody, why don't

18:08.462 --> 18:10.256
we have some ice cream?

18:10.297 --> 18:11.841
That'll be fun.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.551
Here we go.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.844
Everybody, grab a spoon.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.723
No dishes?

18:18.765 --> 18:21.851
No, sweetheart, we're gonna eat

18:18.765 --> 18:21.851
this right out of the carton.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.270
Mmm, there you go.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.356
This is very wrong,

18:24.311 --> 18:27.356
but I'll eat it.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.402
Dig in.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.402
Come on, you guys.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.529
[instrumental music]

18:38.284 --> 18:39.702
Oh, man.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.870
Fix this.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.371
Here we go.

18:42.413 --> 18:43.998
Alright. Yeah.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.959
That looks a lot more natural.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.293
Okay. Oh.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.797
Dad, what are you doing?

18:50.838 --> 18:54.133
Oh, I'm, uh,

18:50.838 --> 18:54.133
I'm un-organizing my closet.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.927
What kind of nut

18:54.174 --> 18:55.927
lived in here, huh?

18:57.095 --> 18:58.345
Hey, Danny,

18:57.095 --> 18:58.345
back in the kitchen

18:58.387 --> 18:59.513
when you said

18:59.555 --> 19:01.808
"psycho with a dust mop."

19:01.849 --> 19:03.392
Where'd you get that from?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.980
Oh, I don't know.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.107
Yes, you do.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.107
You heard me say it, didn't you?

19:10.858 --> 19:14.445
Okay, uh, look, I was, uh,

19:10.858 --> 19:14.445
putting shelf paper

19:14.487 --> 19:15.655
in D.J.'s closet

19:15.696 --> 19:17.115
when you all

19:15.696 --> 19:17.115
were having your

19:17.156 --> 19:18.825
little family meeting.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.993
Ouch.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.954
Listen, Danny, we're, uh

19:22.996 --> 19:24.789
we're sorry, we're-we're

19:22.996 --> 19:24.789
embarrassed by that.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.624
We didn't mean those

19:24.831 --> 19:26.624
things we said.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.375
We're just letting

19:26.666 --> 19:28.375
off a little steam, that's all.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.920
No, no, what

19:28.417 --> 19:30.920
you said was true.

19:30.962 --> 19:34.132
And...and

19:30.962 --> 19:34.132
you hurt my feelings but

19:34.173 --> 19:36.843
I'm glad I know how

19:34.173 --> 19:36.843
you really feel about me now.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.887
A-and I've changed.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.887
Let me show you.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.388
Watch this.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.975
No more baking soda

19:41.430 --> 19:43.975
in my sock drawer.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.060
There you go.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.770
You girls have

19:46.102 --> 19:47.770
a brand new dad.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.231
I don't want a new dad.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.901
I'll chew each bite 24 times,

19:51.273 --> 19:53.901
just like you said.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.030
I just want my old dad back.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.033
So do I.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.205
Who cares if you're

20:04.162 --> 20:06.205
a neat freak?

20:06.246 --> 20:08.499
If it wasn't for you,

20:06.246 --> 20:08.499
I would never make my bed.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.251
Me neither.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.505
You guys really

20:12.712 --> 20:14.505
mean all this?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.423
Danny, of course we mean it.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.675
You keep this family running.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.926
Yeah, you keep us organized.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.178
And there's nine people

20:18.968 --> 20:20.178
living here.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.596
Without you,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.596
it'd be total chaos.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.558
You know, I think

20:22.638 --> 20:25.558
I went too far the other way.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.601
I gotta find a balance between

20:25.599 --> 20:27.601
Captain Clean

20:27.643 --> 20:29.645
and Sergeant Sludge.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.148
And could you help

20:29.687 --> 20:32.148
Michelle find a balance?

20:32.190 --> 20:35.902
Today, she made my bed,

20:32.190 --> 20:35.902
and I was still in it.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.948
Yeah, I guess I better have

20:37.570 --> 20:40.948
a talk with my special helper.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.616
But, you know what,

20:40.990 --> 20:42.616
I-I gotta vacuum up

20:42.658 --> 20:45.912
this baking soda first

20:42.658 --> 20:45.912
'cause it's driving me crazy.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.999
Listen, before you do that, uh,

20:45.953 --> 20:49.999
do us all kind of a big favor.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.250
Take a shower.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.794
Okay. I'll be right out.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.922
[instrumental music]

20:58.216 --> 20:59.842
Michelle, I, uh

20:59.884 --> 21:01.928
think we have

20:59.884 --> 21:01.928
to have a little talk.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.345
I lined up all my animals.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.765
They go to little to big.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.851
Look, sweetheart.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.941
Why do you want

21:12.354 --> 21:14.941
your animals like that?

21:14.982 --> 21:16.400
Because they're neat

21:14.982 --> 21:16.400
and they're clean

21:16.442 --> 21:18.194
and that's the way

21:16.442 --> 21:18.194
you like them.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.905
Sweetie, come here.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.033
Honey..

21:24.992 --> 21:26.202
...I think it's wonderful that

21:26.244 --> 21:28.788
you want things neat and clean.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.540
But sometimes your dad likes

21:28.829 --> 21:31.540
things a little bit

21:31.582 --> 21:33.918
too neat and too clean.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.212
And too much

21:33.960 --> 21:36.212
of anything is not good.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.547
Even ice cream?

21:40.091 --> 21:42.176
Yes, even ice cream.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.264
Look, I think maybe you should

21:43.844 --> 21:46.264
be a little less like your dad

21:46.305 --> 21:48.057
and maybe a little more

21:46.305 --> 21:48.057
like your sisters.

21:48.099 --> 21:50.476
You want me to be a slob?

21:51.685 --> 21:54.147
No, I don't want you

21:51.685 --> 21:54.147
to be a slob.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.523
But just because your dad

21:54.188 --> 21:56.523
likes things neat and tidy

21:56.565 --> 21:58.358
doesn't mean you have

21:56.565 --> 21:58.358
to be exactly like me.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.487
I just want you to be

21:59.568 --> 22:01.487
Michelle Tanner.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.156
I can do it.

22:03.197 --> 22:05.532
Oh. That's great, honey.

22:05.574 --> 22:09.203
Now, are you sure you want

22:05.574 --> 22:09.203
your animals to sleep like that?

22:09.245 --> 22:11.664
Could they sleep

22:09.245 --> 22:11.664
on my bed with me?

22:11.705 --> 22:13.499
Yeah, but only

22:11.705 --> 22:13.499
if you get in it.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.959
Go ahead.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.959
I'll throw them to you.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.752
- Okay?

22:15.001 --> 22:16.752
- Okay.

Here's Blinky and Pookie.

There, here's

a little Joel bear with

22:22.549 --> 22:23.926
