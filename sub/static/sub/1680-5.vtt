WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:02.320
kids,back to the forwards 2007

00:02.330 --> 00:04.090
i was dating the girl named...

00:04.100 --> 00:05.100
oh, god, what was her name?

00:05.100 --> 00:08.250
you know, it's been 23 years,i can't remember all the staff

00:08.260 --> 00:09.650
for the sake of the story,let's call her...

00:09.660 --> 00:11.000
everyone, this is blahblah.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.330
please, call me blah.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.250
so, blah, how did you two meet?

00:16.260 --> 00:18.390
well, i was taking this cooking class,

00:18.400 --> 00:21.450
french fusion, and everyone already had a partner,

00:21.460 --> 00:25.160
but then i looked up and across a crowded room,

00:25.430 --> 00:26.650
i saw ted.it was magical.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.150
it was so magical.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.720
except it wasn't.

00:31.730 --> 00:34.520
she's gonna tell story about the cooking class,

00:34.530 --> 00:38.030
because she's embarrassed we met online.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.120
what? there's no stigma anymore.

00:40.130 --> 00:41.620
oh, there's a stigma.

00:41.630 --> 00:44.120
there's why people always say,"there's no stigma anymore."

00:44.130 --> 00:45.420
so, she's hot?

00:45.430 --> 00:46.520
oh, she's gorgeous.

00:46.530 --> 00:47.590
then she's crazy.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.890
no, she's not.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.490
ted, the only hot girls that troll the internet

00:51.500 --> 00:55.650
for dudes are crazy,hookers, or dude

00:55.660 --> 00:56.390
okay, she's not crazy.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.420
she's not a hooker.

00:57.430 --> 00:58.350
she's not a dude.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.890
there's this guy i pass on my way to work every day

01:00.900 --> 01:03.450
who's all three-- scares the crap out of me.

01:03.460 --> 01:04.989
there is no way she is above the line

01:05.000 --> 01:06.420
on the hot/crazy scale.

01:06.430 --> 01:07.950
she's not even on the hot/crazy scale.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.150
she's just hot.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.990
wait. "hot/crazy scale"?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.250
let me illustrate.

01:13.260 --> 01:14.920
a girl is allowed to be crazy

01:14.930 --> 01:18.790
as long as she is equally hot.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.390
thus, if she's this crazy,

01:20.400 --> 01:22.390
she has to be this hot.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.520
if she's this crazy,

01:23.530 --> 01:26.420
she has to be this hot.

01:26.430 --> 01:29.150
you want a girl to be above this line,

01:29.160 --> 01:32.220
also known as the vickie mendoza diagonal.

01:32.230 --> 01:35.050
this girl i dated, she played jump rope with that line.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.390
she'd shave her head,then lose ten pounds.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.050
she'd stab me with a fork,then get a boob job.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.000
i should give her a call.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074

01:57.000 --> 01:57.690
okay, so please,

01:57.700 --> 01:58.920
just play along with her fake story.

01:58.930 --> 02:01.190
we met in a cooking class.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.350
i don't know, ted.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.750
i don't know if i can just play along

02:03.760 --> 02:06.420
with your crazy girlfriend's fake story.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.320
now, if you had said fake breasts...

02:08.330 --> 02:09.990
she's not crazy.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.520
okay. we'll see.

02:12.530 --> 02:16.050
long story short, thank goodness i'm such a bad cook

02:16.060 --> 02:19.490
or i never would have met ted.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.990
oh, crazy.how cute that is.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.750
it's crazy.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.250
you know who else has a really cute story of how they met?

02:25.260 --> 02:26.590
marshal and lily.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.550
you guys should tell that story, right now.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.050
all right.but spoiler alert.

02:30.060 --> 02:31.520
it ends with everyone saying, "aw!"

02:31.530 --> 02:32.520
aw.

02:32.530 --> 02:34.250
starts with it, too.

02:34.260 --> 02:37.250
when you've been a couple as long as marshal and lily,

02:37.260 --> 02:40.490
telling the how-we-met story becomes a choreographed dance.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.890
it was late august, 1996.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.890
lily and i were both freshman moving into...

02:44.900 --> 02:47.020
hewitt hall.

02:47.030 --> 02:49.090
and she needed some help setting up her stereo.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.250
for some unknown reason,

02:52.260 --> 02:54.490
i felt drawn to room 110.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.020
as if she knew

02:56.030 --> 02:59.120
that someone very special was behind that door.

02:59.130 --> 03:04.220
and as fate would have it that someone was marshall.

03:04.230 --> 03:08.830
it was love at first sight.

03:09.430 --> 03:10.650
aw...

03:10.660 --> 03:12.950
i know, right?

03:12.960 --> 03:15.720
now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings.

03:15.730 --> 03:17.690
the first time marshall told it to me,

03:17.700 --> 03:19.120
it was a little different.

03:19.130 --> 03:21.490
dude, this black-haired goth chick stopped by today.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.890
want to tap it.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.620
you guys are so lucky.

03:27.630 --> 03:29.350
you know, when ted and i were cooking

03:29.360 --> 03:30.820
and our hands touched for the first time,

03:30.830 --> 03:32.920
i knew right then that after class

03:32.930 --> 03:35.320
he would take me up on the roof,kiss me and give me a rose.

03:35.330 --> 03:38.350
which he did!

03:38.360 --> 03:39.290
say, "aw."

03:39.300 --> 03:42.050
aw.

03:42.060 --> 03:43.450
i know, right?

03:43.460 --> 03:47.060
i'll get the next round,okay, guys?

03:50.060 --> 03:54.220
anybody would be stressed out meeting new people.

03:54.230 --> 03:55.650
she's not crazy.

03:55.660 --> 03:59.090
crazy-generous maybe,buying us drinks.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.730
shut up.

04:03.050 --> 04:05.360
so how marshall and lily met 

04:05.360 --> 04:07.890
robin, how did you and barney meet?

04:07.900 --> 04:10.190
no... 

04:10.200 --> 04:12.220
no, no, no, no.

04:12.230 --> 04:15.820
no, no, no, no.no, no, no.

04:15.830 --> 04:20.190
no. no. barney and i are not together. no. no.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.690
really? 16 no's?really?

04:23.700 --> 04:24.720
so you're...

04:24.730 --> 04:25.790
single?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.960
yeah.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.920
oh. so, pretty and single and friends with ted.

04:30.930 --> 04:33.890
great.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.120
you know who else is friends with ted?

04:36.130 --> 04:37.120
marshall.

04:37.130 --> 04:38.350
how did we meet?

04:38.360 --> 04:39.750
it was a good story.

04:39.760 --> 04:40.920
i'm going to tell it,right now.

04:40.930 --> 04:42.720
uh, it was the first day of college.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.520
kids, to understand this story,you need to know

04:44.530 --> 04:46.590
that your uncle marshall was doing something

04:46.600 --> 04:48.050
that lots of college kids do.

04:48.060 --> 04:49.450
how do i say this?

04:49.460 --> 04:55.230
he was, uh...let's say, eating a sandwich.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.250
dude, i heard the dean is coming.

04:59.260 --> 05:02.760
put out your sandwich.

05:09.660 --> 05:12.790
good afternoon, sir.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.250
i'm marshall erickson.

05:14.260 --> 05:17.150
"sir"? no, please,just call me ted.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.190
okay, dean ted.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.350
someone's been eating a sandwich.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.950
what? no. really?

05:25.960 --> 05:29.450
i don't know 'cause i don't even know what sandwiches smell like.

05:29.460 --> 05:33.950
my parents are going to donate a lot of money to this school.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.090
so you're bottom bunk that's cool.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.490
i wanted the top bunk anyway.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.750
what do you mean?

05:39.760 --> 05:43.230
i'm you're new roommate.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.790
so unfair.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.220
i didn't realize ted wasn't the dean

05:48.230 --> 05:50.960
until later that night.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.150
you're not the dean.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.150
college-- good times.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.590
oh, i get it. ted told you.i didn't go to college,

06:03.600 --> 06:06.120
so now you're giving me a cute, little backhanded slap.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.950
oh, here we go.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.620
well, while you were busy majoring

06:10.630 --> 06:11.950
in being freakin' beautiful,

06:11.960 --> 06:12.950
i was starting

06:12.960 --> 06:14.490
my own line of handbags.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.920
your own line of handbags?

06:15.930 --> 06:17.620
that's crazy.

06:17.630 --> 06:19.220
these have sold in japan.

06:19.230 --> 06:21.050
robin, have you ever sold anything in japan?

06:21.060 --> 06:24.790
uh, no. but i would love to buy one of them, if...

06:24.800 --> 06:26.520
where can i get one?

06:26.530 --> 06:28.190
i don't have a distributor here yet,

06:28.200 --> 06:29.620
but thanks for rubbing that in.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.890
why are you trying to undermine me in front of ted?

06:31.900 --> 06:34.590
look, there's nothing going on between me and ted.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.320
wow, that just.came out of nowhere.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.150
no, i'm just saying that you have nothing to worry about.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.150
i wasn't worried.are you saying i should be?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.220
no, i'm saying that you shouldn't be.

06:44.230 --> 06:45.290
oh, good, 'cause i'm not.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.850
now, robin,can you just let it go?

06:46.860 --> 06:50.550
you're making all of us really uncomfortable.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.590
you know what else is a good story?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.990
how barney and i met.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.350
barney, tell that story,right now, please.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.190
okay, ted.this is a crazy story.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.590
you're going to love it.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.790
tonight's the first time

07:00.800 --> 07:02.190
i'm taking my deaf brother out

07:02.200 --> 07:03.720
since our mom died.

07:03.730 --> 07:06.390
oh, i'm sorry about that.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.890
no, that's okay.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.990
i have to take care of him now.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.790
of course, i have had to put my dreams on hold

07:13.800 --> 07:16.420
in order to do it,but...

07:16.430 --> 07:18.950
i'm happy to.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.890
he's my brother and i love him.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.950
i'm sorry,it's all still so fresh.

07:23.960 --> 07:29.200
well, man, i'm, uh...i'm really sorry.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.790
wow, you bought that?

07:30.800 --> 07:32.050
what?

07:32.060 --> 07:33.720
i just made that up in mid-pee.

07:33.730 --> 07:35.120
if it worked on you,it's definitely going to work

07:35.130 --> 07:37.750
on the blonde chick at the end of the bar.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.020
unless you're a total idiot.

07:39.030 --> 07:40.090
what's your name?

07:40.100 --> 07:41.390
ted.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.120
are you a total idiot, ted?

07:43.130 --> 07:46.150
well, i'm still having this conversation, so...

07:46.160 --> 07:49.200
well played.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.890
i like you, ted.

07:51.900 --> 07:55.950
ted, i'm going to teach you how to live.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.550
barney.we met at the urinal.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.450
oh, right. hi.

07:59.460 --> 08:02.490
lesson one: lose the goatee;it doesn't go with your suit.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.650
i'm not wearing a suit.

08:03.660 --> 08:04.920
lesson two: get a suit.

08:04.930 --> 08:07.350
suits are cool--exhibit a.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.850
lesson three: don't even think about getting married

08:09.860 --> 08:11.190
until you're 30.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.850
and lesson four:

08:12.860 --> 08:14.590
be totally silent for the next five minutes.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.690
hey, audrey.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.550
uh, this is my deaf brother, edward.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.990
edward!

08:20.000 --> 08:24.190
this is audrey!

08:24.200 --> 08:28.160
you know, i actually know some sign language.

08:34.130 --> 08:35.520
he doesn't sign.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.720
he's embarrassed by his hands.

08:37.730 --> 08:40.760
they're tiny...and lady-like.

08:43.490 --> 08:47.390
what? you...are over your hand issues.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.950
it's about time.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.430
here. call me.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.690
and even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number,

09:09.700 --> 09:12.990
i knew that ted and i would be each others wingmen forever.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.050
barney, it's time you knew.

09:15.060 --> 09:17.670
um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.750
great. funny.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.790
god, with a wingman like ted,i might need to resort

09:30.800 --> 09:33.720
to meeting someone in a super,desperate and lame way,

09:33.730 --> 09:36.500
like online.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.790
online.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.790
online.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.420
oh, my god!you told them?!

09:43.430 --> 09:44.890
okay, yes, i told them.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.520
but it's not a big deal.

09:46.530 --> 09:48.350
lots of people meet on the internet.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.620
that whole scene, a stranger across a crowded room thing--

09:50.630 --> 09:52.390
that only happens in the movies.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.690
yeah, that never happens.oh, wait, except you and robin.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.000
that's how you guys met, right?

10:02.460 --> 10:05.650
wait, you guys dated?

10:05.660 --> 10:06.650
for how long?

10:06.660 --> 10:08.550
a year.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.620
but don't worry.

10:09.630 --> 10:11.320
the relationship wasn't that good.

10:11.330 --> 10:13.890
by the end, it was mostly about sex.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.950
which was not that good.

10:15.960 --> 10:16.990
but i was the problem.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.220
i'd just lie there.

10:19.230 --> 10:20.490
ted is, uh,very good.

10:20.500 --> 10:25.600
i'm sure he will get you where you need to go.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.290
can i buy your bags online?

10:28.300 --> 10:31.420
oh, oh, i see what's going on here, ted.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.320
i'm just some random girl to make robin jealous,

10:33.330 --> 10:34.450
and after she takes you back,

10:34.460 --> 10:35.920
you probably won't even remember my name.

10:35.930 --> 10:39.290
come on, blahblah,it's not like that.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.690
well, we're closing in the half.

10:40.700 --> 10:45.120
let's see how blahblah is doing on the crazy/hot scale.

10:45.130 --> 10:48.390
she started the night here,but as the night's progressed,

10:48.400 --> 10:50.890
she's gotten crazier but no hotter,

10:50.900 --> 10:54.350
which has caused her to drift across the mendoza diagonal

10:54.360 --> 10:57.890
and dangerously close to the shelly gilespie zone.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.490
another girl i dated--

10:59.500 --> 11:02.590
she gained 20 pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.790
i'm sorry i didn't tell you, but seriously,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.420
there's nothing going on with me and robin.

11:06.430 --> 11:08.890
then why has she been trying to undermine me all night?

11:08.900 --> 11:09.920
i mean, look at her.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.960
she's laughing at me right now.

11:15.530 --> 11:17.390
i'm sorry,it's just, you know,

11:17.400 --> 11:19.920
lily and marshall's story is so romantic.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.320
i just wish we had something like that.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.450
well, their story's not as magical as it seems.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.020
what do you mean?

11:26.030 --> 11:28.990
no, i, i can't, it's,it's kind of a secret.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.950
well, how about i tell you a little secret

11:31.960 --> 11:36.760
about what you might get to do later tonight?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.320
the night before lily met marshall...

11:42.330 --> 11:43.000
...there was this party.

11:50.230 --> 11:51.290
you a freshwoman?

11:51.300 --> 11:52.750
i never use the word "freshman."

11:52.760 --> 11:54.120
sexist.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.090
yeah, i'm a first year.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.750
i'm in hewitt 220.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.620
no way. hewitt 110.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.820
you should totally come by.

12:00.830 --> 12:03.520
maybe i will, hewitt 110.

12:03.530 --> 12:05.150
chug! chug! chug!

12:05.160 --> 12:06.720
chug! chug! chug!

12:06.730 --> 12:09.430
chug!chug! chug!

12:13.200 --> 12:15.320
look at these drunk idiots.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.990
hey, don't drink their two dollar beer.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.220
this is a pinot noir.

12:19.230 --> 12:22.260
from europe.

12:24.730 --> 12:26.750
oh, it's fruity.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.450
yeah, i cut it with some cranberry juice.

12:28.460 --> 12:31.160
it was pretty strong.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.450
do you have a girlfriend?

12:34.460 --> 12:35.950
yeah.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.250
not sure about the whole "long distance" thing, though.

12:38.260 --> 12:39.320
it's like descartes says.

12:39.330 --> 12:40.950
"in order to determine

12:40.960 --> 12:43.590
"whether there is anything we can know with certainty,

12:43.600 --> 12:46.890
we first have to doubt everything we know."

12:46.900 --> 12:49.460
you know?

12:54.200 --> 12:56.590
but as drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning,

12:56.600 --> 12:58.820
she still remembered room 110.

12:58.830 --> 13:00.650
that's why she knocked on the door.

13:00.660 --> 13:02.020
she was looking for me.

13:02.030 --> 13:03.150
oh, my god.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.750
yeah, and in all these years,

13:04.760 --> 13:06.620
lily and i have never even spoken about it,

13:06.630 --> 13:08.250
so again, mum's thword, okay?

13:08.260 --> 13:09.990
you have to tell marshall.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.650
no, if, if he heard that, it would destroy him.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.150
if you don't tell him...

13:16.160 --> 13:18.250
...i will.

13:18.260 --> 13:21.700
oh, come on, you wouldn't.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.120
so, lily,how did you and ted meet?

13:29.130 --> 13:31.620
come on, lily, the real story.

13:31.630 --> 13:33.550
i don't think anyone wants to hear that story.

13:33.560 --> 13:37.520
aw, don't be embarrassed, ted,it was a long time ago.

13:37.530 --> 13:39.950
and i made a huge mistake last night,

13:39.960 --> 13:41.820
but it's like descartes says.

13:41.830 --> 13:43.150
"in order to determine whether there is anything

13:43.160 --> 13:44.520
"we can know with certainty,

13:44.530 --> 13:47.930
we first have to doubt everything we know."

13:48.430 --> 13:52.320
and i now know for certain that i love you, karen.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.720
anyway, call me back when you get this.

13:54.730 --> 13:56.350
i'm also going down to the computer center

13:56.360 --> 13:59.800
to send you an electronic mail.

14:00.860 --> 14:02.950
ted.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.390
this is lily.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.220
no, no, i'm sorry,but i love karen.

14:08.230 --> 14:11.250
yes, that is the unabridged story of how lily and i met.

14:11.260 --> 14:12.720
how embarrassing.

14:12.730 --> 14:14.150
-who wants another round? -that's not the story.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.250
ted, tell 'em.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.550
tell us what?um, lily,

14:16.560 --> 14:18.020
will you help us get the next round?

14:18.030 --> 14:19.950
ted, what's going on?

14:19.960 --> 14:24.150
she knows about us,about how we really met.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.950
yeah, i know,i just told her.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.890
no, the real story.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.990
ted, what are you talking about?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.720
lily... come on.

14:32.730 --> 14:34.150
come on, what?

14:34.160 --> 14:37.390
lily... come on.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.550
ted, i honestly don't know what you're talking about.

14:40.560 --> 14:44.250
lily... come on.

14:44.260 --> 14:46.190
i know that you and ted made out

14:46.200 --> 14:48.120
the night before you met marshall.

14:48.130 --> 14:49.220
what?

14:49.230 --> 14:50.450
ted and i never made out.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.290
yeah... we did.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.720
i only made out with one other guy in college

14:54.730 --> 14:58.050
before i met marshall, and it was just some random dude.

14:58.060 --> 15:00.120
i, i don't even remember his name.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.820
i just call him too much tongue guy.

15:01.830 --> 15:03.520
what? too much tongue guy?

15:03.530 --> 15:05.290
well, i'm not surprised to hear that

15:05.300 --> 15:07.450
coming from unreasonably small mouth opening girl.

15:07.460 --> 15:09.120
that wasn't me.

15:09.130 --> 15:11.790
yes, it was, at the freshman orientation party.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.990
no, no, no, no, no.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.090
no, no.

15:16.100 --> 15:19.920
no, no, no, no, no!

15:19.930 --> 15:21.520
how much fun is this?

15:21.530 --> 15:24.320
all of us reminiscing about how we met me?

15:24.330 --> 15:26.720
robin, have i told you how i met marshall?

15:26.730 --> 15:28.290
uh, yeah,like five or six times--

15:28.300 --> 15:29.890
it was right over there.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.150
here's your problem.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.120
you've only slept with one woman.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.450
those kind of stats are only okay if you're 11,

15:35.460 --> 15:36.450
but tonight

15:36.460 --> 15:38.650
we're getting you a new girl

15:38.660 --> 15:40.320
because,marshall eriksen,

15:40.330 --> 15:44.550
from this moment on, i make all your decisions for you.

15:44.560 --> 15:48.690
i'm sorry,who, who are you again?

15:48.700 --> 15:50.490
this is barney; i met him the other day.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.520
he's kind of a jackass.

15:51.530 --> 15:53.520
i'm teaching ted how to live,

15:53.530 --> 15:55.790
and-- lucky you-- i have room for one more student.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.290
think of me as yoda

15:57.300 --> 15:59.850
as yoda, only instead of being little and green,

15:59.860 --> 16:01.990
i wear suits and i'm awesome.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.290
i'm your bro.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.820
i'm bro-da.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.150
and tonight,

16:06.160 --> 16:07.690
you're going to use the force

16:07.700 --> 16:10.290
to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.990
he's going to use force?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.420
cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.

16:14.430 --> 16:16.020
no, the force.

16:16.030 --> 16:17.950
it's a star wars reference.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.920
so we should make lots of star wars references around girls.

16:19.930 --> 16:21.320
that's what you're saying?

16:21.330 --> 16:23.320
i'm not going to cheat on my girlfriend.

16:23.330 --> 16:26.690
yes, you are, with the hottiest that just walked in.

16:26.700 --> 16:27.650
look at her.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.220
how much hotter is she

16:29.230 --> 16:31.720
than your girlfriend?

16:31.730 --> 16:34.690
there's no comparison.

16:34.700 --> 16:35.720
what do you think, ted?

16:35.730 --> 16:36.720
-no. -should i go for it?

16:36.730 --> 16:37.920
don't do it, man.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.050
i mean, think about lily.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.320
you know what? i don't care.

16:41.330 --> 16:43.350
i've been with one woman for too long.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.430
i need me some strange.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.690
pep talk.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.320
you can do this,

16:50.330 --> 16:52.950
but to be more accurate, you probably can't.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.950
you're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you,

16:55.960 --> 16:59.350
so remember, tonight isn't about scoring.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.250
it's about believing that you can do it

17:02.260 --> 17:05.220
even though you probably can't.

17:05.230 --> 17:08.000
go get 'em, tiger.

17:15.500 --> 17:19.000
poor guy's going to crash and burn.

17:21.130 --> 17:24.589
that man is a god.

17:24.599 --> 17:25.650
for like a week after,

17:25.660 --> 17:27.750
barney followed me around

17:27.760 --> 17:29.490
asking me to teach him how to live.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.350
i even got him to do my laundry once.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.390
i thought it was a mr.miyagi kind of thing.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.520
marshall, i need to talk to you.

17:36.530 --> 17:38.120
can we go somewhere in private?

17:38.130 --> 17:39.790
yeah, of course. what's wrong?

17:39.800 --> 17:41.250
lily and ted made out.

17:41.260 --> 17:44.050
what do you think of that, robin?

17:44.060 --> 17:45.350
what are you talking about?

17:45.360 --> 17:47.020
you know that guy i made out with

17:47.030 --> 17:48.990
at the freshman orientation party?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.920
too much tongue guy, yeah.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.320
and you know that girl i made out with

17:52.330 --> 17:53.890
at the freshman orientation party?

17:53.900 --> 17:57.020
unreasonably small mouth opening girl, yeah.

17:57.030 --> 17:58.490
i'm too much tongue guy.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.120
and i'm unreasonably small mouth opening girl.

18:01.130 --> 18:03.320
worst superheroes ever.

18:03.330 --> 18:05.750
oh, baby, i am so sorry.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.390
i dot think you need to be.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.590
i was at that party.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.250
it was dark and, granted,

18:10.260 --> 18:13.790
i had eaten quite a few sandwiches, but i'm 100% sure

18:13.800 --> 18:15.720
that unreasonably small mouth opening girl

18:15.730 --> 18:17.620
was alexa leskeys, not lily.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.650
really?

18:18.660 --> 18:20.020
yeah, i'm positive,

18:20.030 --> 18:22.920
and too much tongue guy was colin o'reilly.

18:22.930 --> 18:23.950
are you sure?

18:23.960 --> 18:25.290
if it wasn't,

18:25.300 --> 18:29.030
i peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.220
you don't really believe that, do you?

18:32.230 --> 18:36.550
you swore it was lily.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.250
i guess i made a mistake.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.650
must have been alexa.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.350
another girl, ted?

18:44.360 --> 18:45.890
who haven't you made out with?

18:45.900 --> 18:47.690
you know what? i don't need this.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.790
i design handbags, i'm writing a memoir,

18:49.800 --> 18:52.120
i'm a superstar, this is totally my year.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.450
someday the name blahblah will be up in lights.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.550
and, ted, next time you're online

18:56.560 --> 18:57.920
playing world of warcraft,

18:57.930 --> 19:01.460
don't even think about chatting with me.

19:03.330 --> 19:06.220
world of warcraft?

19:06.230 --> 19:07.350
the online

19:07.360 --> 19:08.850
role-playing game?

19:08.860 --> 19:10.350
that's how you two

19:10.360 --> 19:12.490
"met online"?

19:24.230 --> 19:26.190
yeah, it's a really--it's a cool game.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.820
so suffice it to say,

19:27.830 --> 19:30.490
blahblah did not turn out to be your mother,

19:30.500 --> 19:32.690
and as for the girl i made out with at the party,

19:32.700 --> 19:35.350
there wasn't a doubt in my mind that was your aunt lily.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.190
but, you know, that magical story

19:37.200 --> 19:39.020
of how she and uncle marshall met,

19:39.030 --> 19:42.690
it was worth preserving, so i kept my mouth shut.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.050
i guess i made a mistake.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.550
must have been alexa.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.450
until our 20th college reunion

19:49.460 --> 19:52.850
when i ran into alexa leskeys.

19:52.860 --> 19:57.420
so, ted, remember the last time we were here?

19:57.430 --> 19:58.420
you and me?

19:58.430 --> 19:59.420
no idea.

19:59.430 --> 20:03.220
ted... come on.
