WEBVTT

00:05.270 --> 00:06.134
(door opens)

00:06.170 --> 00:08.092
Shouldn't be more
than an hour, okay?

00:08.140 --> 00:09.562
Last time, it was
20 minutes. Before then,

00:09.610 --> 00:12.033
it was just a moment.
We are going bacloNards here.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.206
Your obsession with time
speaks as to why

00:13.240 --> 00:15.037
this experiment is worthwhile.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.446
I guarantee you
that making a homemade lightbulb

00:17.480 --> 00:19.675
is not worth the cost
of a new electrical panel.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.210
You're baiting me.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.515
A xenon arc lamp
of this size is unheard of.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.108
Had my design been successful,

00:26.160 --> 00:27.718
every mental health benefit
of sunlight

00:27.760 --> 00:30.627
would have been ours to enjoy
at any hour of the day or night.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.548
Day and night being concepts
which would have become

00:32.600 --> 00:34.454
devoid of meaning
within these walls.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.058
Well, it didn't work,
and I cannot find

00:36.100 --> 00:37.590
my new scarf anywhere.

00:37.630 --> 00:39.234
The paisley one?
I threw that out.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.396
It was covered
In chewed-up

00:40.440 --> 00:42.362
plantain and saliva.
Not that I recall.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.139
The pit viper incident
last week.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.068
I needed a poultice.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.577
Oh, and so you used my...

00:46.610 --> 00:48.077
My mother gave me that scarf.

00:48.110 --> 00:50.249
I was gonna wear it
to our lunch tomorrow.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.645
Well, that's curious.
What is?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.819
Well, as well as being
an enthusiastic practitioner

00:53.850 --> 00:56.114
of maternal judgment,
Mary Watson is also a model

00:56.150 --> 00:58.084
of consistency.
You don't usually dine until

00:58.120 --> 01:00.384
the third Monday of each month,
so why the change?

01:00.420 --> 01:02.229
All I know is that
she sounded unhappy

01:02.260 --> 01:04.785
when she called me, so I thought
I'd buy myself some grace

01:04.830 --> 01:06.457
by wearing the present
that she gave me.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.627
Oh, well, then I did you
a favor. When confronted

01:08.660 --> 01:10.662
with the profundity of her
sartorial error, she would have

01:10.700 --> 01:12.861
no doubt have questioned your
taste as well as her own, so...

01:12.900 --> 01:16.666
You know,
just go fix the light.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.564
(dance music playing)
WOMAN: I swear, he's such
a creeper. Like I'm really

01:18.610 --> 01:20.237
supposed to believe
Dennis just happened to go

01:20.280 --> 01:22.544
to the same random club
as me tonight? I'm telling you,

01:22.580 --> 01:24.207
one day they're gonna
find my skeleton

01:24.250 --> 01:25.808
propped up on his futon.

01:25.850 --> 01:29.638
Hold on. I hate this song,
and I'm, like, lost as hell.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.511
(music continues quietly)

01:44.700 --> 01:46.691
(gas hissing)

01:55.240 --> 01:57.174
Hey.

01:57.210 --> 02:00.111
Hey, are you okay?

02:05.890 --> 02:08.450
Oh, my God.

02:13.260 --> 02:16.195
You guys got here fast.

02:16.230 --> 02:18.289
We were already awake
when you texted.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.831
Early to bed, early to rise.

02:19.870 --> 02:22.304
A life without electricity
confers certain advantages.

02:22.340 --> 02:23.705
So what have we here?

02:23.740 --> 02:25.469
Road rage, it looks like.

02:25.510 --> 02:28.707
The vic is Allie Newmeyer--
college kid from Yonkers.

02:28.740 --> 02:31.470
Given the car, the clothes,
I'd say she got lost

02:31.510 --> 02:33.478
on her way home from
partying, ran the stop sign,

02:33.520 --> 02:36.614
T-boned the perp,
and he caved her skull in.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.208
Hmm. Paint transfer
give you anything?

02:38.250 --> 02:40.286
The height and color tell us

02:40.320 --> 02:42.356
we're looking for
a white van or truck,

02:42.390 --> 02:44.358
but that's all _
that tells us anything

02:44.390 --> 02:45.459
about who
we're looking for.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.720
No traffic cams, no witnesses.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.321
Nevertheless, you seem to have
the matter well in hand.

02:51.370 --> 02:52.837
You begging off?

02:52.870 --> 02:55.691
From what?
The issuance of an APB?

02:55.740 --> 02:57.958
A more thorough canvassing
of the neighborhood?

02:58.010 --> 02:59.534
Respectfully, whether
you're scoring

02:59.580 --> 03:01.901
on novelty or complexity,
this crime scene

03:01.940 --> 03:03.544
doesn't really rate, does it?

03:03.580 --> 03:05.377
Take a look at the body.

03:05.410 --> 03:08.447
Detective. ..
Would you just
take a look at the body?

03:19.460 --> 03:22.497
Would it _not have been
Simpler just to tell us?

03:22.530 --> 03:24.191
What?

03:26.030 --> 03:28.794
This woman wasn't just murdered.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.378
She was rapidly
turning into a mummy.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.478
You're not gonna believe
what did this to her.

04:07.510 --> 04:08.807
Refrigerant?
Refrigerant.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.377
Lab gave you
the mass spec results?

04:11.410 --> 04:12.809
No, but I've
seen it before.

04:12.850 --> 04:14.772
Air conditioning repairman
came into the ER.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.516
He was draining a condenser and
spilled some fluid on his arm.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.586
Mm, I just knew.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.315
Don't sulk.
Tell us which variety.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.329
R22. Nasty business.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.692
Caused that medical
defatting you see there.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.493
Not a bad way to leech
every last drop

04:28.530 --> 04:30.498
of moisture out of human flesh.

04:30.530 --> 04:32.532
Would have been agonizing
if she wasn't already dead.

04:32.570 --> 04:34.595
So you know the order
of events, too.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.461
Well, her facial musculature
was slack, which means

04:37.510 --> 04:39.330
that she wasn't suffering
at the moment of death.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.529
I can give you
my best guess about

04:40.580 --> 04:42.309
the murder weapon
if you want it.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.500
An old tire iron. Little
bit of rust in the wound.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.643
Judging by the angle,
I'd say you're looking for

04:46.680 --> 04:49.342
a big right-handed guy--
tall, strong.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.789
Shouldn't be more than
a million people

04:50.820 --> 04:52.515
fitting that description
in New York.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.516
Body and clothes were dusted.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.528
No prints.
I wish I could give you

04:56.560 --> 04:57.458
something else
to narrow it down.

04:57.490 --> 05:00.050
The formulation
of the coolant may suffice.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.522
There can't be
that many people

05:01.560 --> 05:04.097
toting around
large quantities of R22.

05:04.130 --> 05:06.462
We'll need to compile
a list of businesses which house

05:06.500 --> 05:09.401
caches of refrigerant--
HVAC repair companies,

05:09.440 --> 05:12.432
chemical plants and of course
any food distribution warehouses

05:12.480 --> 05:14.573
in the vicinity of the accident.
Shall we?

05:14.610 --> 05:16.441
Oh, you should. I can't.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.107
I have that lunch with
my mother, remember?

05:18.150 --> 05:19.447
Don't look so glum.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.414
I'm the one
who has to sort through

05:21.450 --> 05:23.418
thousands of Bronx meatpackers.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.441
You only have to contend
with one small vegetarian.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.460
Mom, did you not get my text?
I told you I was gonna be late.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.832
I had a hair appointment.
I couldn't move it.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.088
You're busy, too, I see?

05:42.140 --> 05:44.506
Yes, new case, but I'll
catch you up another time.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.576
This probably isn't
the best place.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.931
It's just as well.
I have to get going

05:48.980 --> 05:51.540
and I should
just get right to it.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.618
You have to talk
to your brother.

05:54.650 --> 05:56.515
Why?

05:56.550 --> 05:57.983
He's having an affair.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.954
What?

05:59.990 --> 06:03.756
Six months after the wedding,
and already this.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.429
He's going to ruin his marriage.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.859
Where is this coming from?
Did he say something?

06:07.900 --> 06:11.495
You know I went to see them
the other week.

06:11.530 --> 06:14.567
He seemed happy.
Gabrielle seemed happy.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.706
Like newlyweds, but...

06:17.740 --> 06:20.504
I took a car to Faneuil Hall
to shop one day.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.771
When I came back, I saw Oren
kissing some blonde woman

06:23.810 --> 06:25.744
in the driveway.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.941
Well, what did he have to say
for himself?

06:27.980 --> 06:30.517
I didn't let him know I'd seen.

06:30.550 --> 06:31.539
You didn't talk to him?

06:31.590 --> 06:33.717
I couldn't.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.115
Oren hardly
spoke to me or Dad

06:36.160 --> 06:40.051
after your father's affair,
and I wasn't to blame.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.954
But I understood.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.628
It's a hard thing to talk about.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.093
Yes, it is, but I don't see how
me getting in the middle of it

06:47.140 --> 06:49.563
is gonna make it any better.
Except maybe for you.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.602
What do you want
me to do here?

06:52.640 --> 06:54.608
He listens to you, Joan.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.508
Maybe he'll listen if you
tell him not to ruin his life.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.215
GREGSON:
You two are leaving?

07:02.250 --> 07:05.788
I'm gonna assume you caught
a break on the road rage thing?

07:05.820 --> 07:09.187
Yeah, we've been calling
the big R22 vendors and buyers,

07:09.220 --> 07:11.780
found out there's a lot fewer
companies that trade In

07:11.830 --> 07:13.695
this particular chemical
than there used to be.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.790
In the 19905, the EPA
launched a long-term phaseout

07:16.830 --> 07:18.718
of the type of refrigerant
carried by our killer--

07:18.770 --> 07:20.533
part of their effort
to curb emissions

07:20.570 --> 07:21.639
that erode the ozone layer.

07:21.670 --> 07:23.661
By 2020,
R22's sale and manufacture

07:23.710 --> 07:26.577
will be entirely illegal within
the U.S., and this year will see

07:26.610 --> 07:28.908
a mandatory 56% reduction.
And as you're no doubt

07:28.940 --> 07:31.500
already surmising,
that kind of regulatory pressure

07:31.550 --> 07:34.075
has led to soaring prices
in the nascent black market.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.611
So, what, the refrigeration
business is the Wild West now?

07:36.650 --> 07:37.617
BELL:
quwm,

07:37.650 --> 07:39.140
but a friend at the FBI says

07:39.190 --> 07:41.715
a lot of the manufacturers
are exceeding their allocations

07:41.760 --> 07:43.648
and selling the surplus
off the books.

07:43.690 --> 07:46.079
Good news is thefts
are on the rIse as well.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.655
That is good news.
BELL: Well, it gives us
a couple leads.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.692
Out of a dozen open cases, two
of them have witness statements

07:51.730 --> 07:53.595
_ _that mention _
suspICIous white vehicles.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.733
So while I'm gonna meet Watson
at an ice rink, the detective is

07:55.770 --> 07:57.704
on his way to a fish market.
I'm expecting

07:57.740 --> 07:59.833
a lot of interesting smells,
in case you want to join me.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.646
I'm good.
Let me know what you find.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.788
Where is this guy?

08:09.820 --> 08:11.708
The report said
the complainant

08:11.750 --> 08:13.286
had been managing this
facility for 12 years.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.754
Were this my lot in life,
you'd have to stir me

08:15.790 --> 08:18.088
to action with
a cattle prod.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.928
Your impatience
is uncharacteristic.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.598
What, you're not cold?

08:23.730 --> 08:25.994
How was your lunch
with your mother?

08:26.030 --> 08:28.260
(sighs) Well, my brother
is having an affair.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.030
Oren is having an affair?

08:31.070 --> 08:34.631
Yeah. She wants me to,
I don't know, fix it, I guess.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.102
How is it your problem?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.607
It's not. It's just, you know,

08:37.650 --> 08:40.016
I'm the least weird person
in my family.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.211
My mother, my stepfather,
by brother--

08:42.250 --> 08:44.548
they all have their issues
and, you know,

08:44.590 --> 08:46.046
sometimes they need a referee.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.058
You're beginning to see
the wisdom in keeping

08:48.090 --> 08:50.786
an ocean in between one's
self and one's relatives.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.752
Oh, right, because
you and your family--

08:52.800 --> 08:54.051
you've got it all
figured out. Right.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.658
Nothing weird about you guys.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.065
We do not require referees.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.136
Were it not for

09:00.170 --> 09:02.707
the evolutionary quirk that
a mature human brain cannot pass

09:02.740 --> 09:05.800
through a dilated cervix,
we might be rid of the pair bond

09:05.840 --> 09:07.728
between parent and child
entirely.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.099
Well, I love my family.

09:09.140 --> 09:12.143
Mm. You enjoy
the occasional meal with Oren

09:12.180 --> 09:14.671
and you exchange Christmas
cards, but the reason you're

09:14.720 --> 09:17.314
vexed is the notion that the
thinnest tendril of shared DNA

09:17.350 --> 09:20.808
makes his extramarital__
gymnastics your responSIbility.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.624
Family is the tie
that binds, but while

09:23.660 --> 09:26.128
one end undergirds
human civilization,

09:26.160 --> 09:29.323
the other is a noose,
choking away our individuation.

09:30.930 --> 09:33.831
You can cut the cord, Watson.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.134
You're the cops?

09:37.170 --> 09:40.230
We're consultants
with the NYPD.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.929
I'm Joan Watson.
This is Sherlock Holmes.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.278
Uh, you're the facilities
manager, Mr. Weissman?

09:44.310 --> 09:47.074
Yes. Uh, Kimmy said
you wanted to talk to me.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.145
_Ms. Watson and I are
investigating a murder.

09:49.180 --> 09:50.909
A murder?

09:50.950 --> 09:52.781
We have an inkling that
the thief who stole

09:52.820 --> 09:54.981
your R22 canisters
last month

09:55.020 --> 09:57.124
may have beaten a
young girl to death.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.718
Would you be so kind

09:58.760 --> 10:00.819
as to show us where the
burglary took place?

10:04.870 --> 10:06.326
Couple of months ago,

10:06.370 --> 10:09.703
I come down here to put
our Christmas decorations away,

10:09.740 --> 10:12.709
I find the door here
wide open.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.879
Guy left in a hurry, I guess.

10:14.910 --> 10:17.003
Well, who else access
to this room?
Just me.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.746
That's how I knew
something was up.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.816
Cops said they
picked the lock.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.386
Well, that's hogwash, isn't it?

10:23.420 --> 10:25.012
You perpetrated the crime

10:25.050 --> 10:27.018
and then you filed
a false report.
Excuse me?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.016
You stole the refrigerant.
These little nicks here--

10:31.790 --> 10:33.849
Teeth on a blank are filed
very, very sharply,

10:33.900 --> 10:35.128
the bump key is then

10:35.160 --> 10:37.390
inserted into the lock,
whacked with some force--

10:37.430 --> 10:40.297
too much force, in this case--
but then, you meant to leave

10:40.340 --> 10:43.002
proof of some malfeasance,
didn't you?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.838
I got the key. Why would I
even want to do something...?

10:45.870 --> 10:47.735
Because you've got a key,
'cause you've got the only key.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.735
There needed to be
an alternative

10:48.780 --> 10:49.633
explanation for the crime.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.046
Anyway, this model has
a side-locking bar--

10:52.080 --> 10:54.241
it's unbumpable.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.919
This was a charade
to fool investigators.

10:56.950 --> 10:58.315
WATSON :
So you reported

10:58.350 --> 11:00.159
25 tanks of R22 were stolen.

11:00.190 --> 11:02.351
Other black market deals
have it hovering

11:02.390 --> 11:04.255
about $200 per tank,

11:04.290 --> 11:06.383
so if we pull your bank records,
are we gonna find

11:06.430 --> 11:08.955
a $4,000 cash deposit
that you can't account for?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.924
I didn't kill anyone.

11:11.970 --> 11:13.267
That's not
what we're implying.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.734
We wish to determine
whether your buyer did.

11:15.770 --> 11:17.408
Your receptionist, Kimmy--

11:17.440 --> 11:19.908
she said she noticed
a white van parked illegally

11:19.940 --> 11:21.737
the morning of the robbery.

11:21.780 --> 11:25.477
Now, if you have something
useful to tell us about that?

11:25.510 --> 11:29.071
I never got his name.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.089
I don't have a telephone number,
credit card, anything like that.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.281
Our deal was cash,
like you said.

11:34.320 --> 11:38.086
He was a little
older than me,

11:38.130 --> 11:39.324
tall white guy.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.827
Came in off the street,

11:40.860 --> 11:42.259
made me an offer,
just like that.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.369
Was it his van?

11:43.400 --> 11:44.822
Yeah.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.326
He wanted me
to deliver the stuff,

11:46.370 --> 11:48.258
but I was worried
it was a setup,

11:48.300 --> 11:51.337
so I told him he had to pick up
the canisters himself.

11:51.370 --> 11:53.338
But he'd already given me
the address.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.769
I've got it written down
in the office somewhere.

11:55.810 --> 11:56.947
Was it in the Bronx?

11:56.980 --> 11:58.743
Yeah, matter of fact.

12:03.450 --> 12:05.418
Well, this is plainly
not the vehicle

12:05.450 --> 12:07.486
that Allie Newmeyer
crashed into.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.886
Yet there are reasons
to believe

12:09.930 --> 12:12.251
that its owner is our killer.

12:12.290 --> 12:13.848
I don't see anything.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.197
That's my point.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.391
Seven years old,
but it's pristine.

12:17.430 --> 12:20.194
There's no plates,
no lint, no smudges.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.959
Just a hint of adhesive
on the windshield

12:23.010 --> 12:25.433
to suggest a recently-removed
"for sale" sticker.

12:25.470 --> 12:28.200
It is parked at the address
given to us by Mr. Weissman.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.434
These are all indicators

12:29.480 --> 12:31.368
that this is
a hasty replacement

12:31.410 --> 12:34.049
for the van which Miss Newmeyer
crashed into last night.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.342
But what is this place?

12:35.380 --> 12:37.314
There's no signage,
there's no business.

12:37.350 --> 12:38.988
You think our guy
squatted here?

12:39.020 --> 12:41.159
Difficult to say.

12:41.190 --> 12:45.126
But answers..._
are at our fingertips.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.526
Hold on. Let me call it in,
see if the captain thinks

12:47.560 --> 12:49.118
we've got enough for a warrant.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.491
(blowing on hands)

12:50.530 --> 12:51.929
It's 12 degrees.

12:51.970 --> 12:53.369
How long would
you wait here

12:53.400 --> 12:55.231
listening to the unattended
infant crying inside?

12:55.270 --> 12:57.465
There's no baby in there.
Now I hear two infants.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.159
There's no rush; nobody's here.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.178
There's no reason
not to do this right.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.974
You would blithely dismiss
the risk of acute hypothermia?

13:04.010 --> 13:05.443
Captain, can you hear me?

13:05.480 --> 13:08.074
Hold on. I want to try
to get a better signal.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.351
(door creaks open)

13:42.220 --> 13:44.211
(door rumbles open)

13:59.170 --> 14:00.592
WATSON:
Sherlock?

14:05.440 --> 14:09.001
I'm not easily surprised,

14:09.040 --> 14:11.474
but I do confess
to not expecting this.

14:22.060 --> 14:25.120
BELL: So we've got Folsom,
Jenkins, Diener,

14:25.160 --> 14:26.627
Choi and the Narducci family.

14:26.660 --> 14:29.026
Is that all of them,
or are there others?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.925
Actually, there are ten more
here in Flushing.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.198
It's been busy lately.

14:32.230 --> 14:33.629
HOLMES:
Tell us, Mr. Misraki,

14:33.670 --> 14:37.231
when your life extension firm
signs a new client,

14:37.270 --> 14:39.261
do your reps explain
that their frozen remains

14:39.310 --> 14:41.938
will one day be laid out
in a meat locker?

14:41.980 --> 14:43.345
BELL:
Supposed to be

14:43.380 --> 14:45.109
keeping them in these things,
aren't you?

14:45.150 --> 14:48.540
As soon as a cryoNYC
member dies,

14:48.580 --> 14:51.344
their body in injected
with a glycol-based solution

14:51.390 --> 14:54.052
and lowered
to 77 degrees Kelvin.

14:54.090 --> 14:57.548
We do that in one of
the cryostats pictured here.

14:57.590 --> 15:00.252
The goal is to make
cellular deterioration

15:00.300 --> 15:01.699
impossible.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.595
That's our pledge--

15:03.630 --> 15:06.019
that all members will be
preserved in sta5is

15:06.070 --> 15:07.958
until nanotechnology
is developed

15:08.000 --> 15:09.934
to restore them to life.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.938
HOLMES: Well, it was
cold in your freezer,

15:11.970 --> 15:14.279
but it was not
minus 196 degrees Centigrade.

15:14.310 --> 15:17.245
_ _ Iwill admit _ _
to instituting some pOIICIes

15:17.280 --> 15:19.339
that might offend decorum.

15:19.380 --> 15:23.180
The truth is, we've oversold
our current facilities,

15:23.220 --> 15:27.657
but we're raising capital
to grow and catch up to demand.

15:27.690 --> 15:29.282
Right.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.254
So, in other words,
when a new client dies,

15:31.290 --> 15:34.498
you throw an old one...
in the meat locker.

15:34.530 --> 15:35.997
We rotate them.

15:36.030 --> 15:38.066
But all clients'
core temperatures

15:38.100 --> 15:40.466
are kept below
the threshold

15:40.500 --> 15:43.958
that industry leaders have
theorized to be sufficient.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.602
"Industry leaders"
meaning you, right?

15:45.640 --> 15:49.371
So you're just keeping them on
ice and hoping for the best?

15:49.410 --> 15:52.345
CryoNYC has to keep costs down.

15:52.380 --> 15:55.213
We invest
every dollar we can,

15:55.250 --> 15:59.516
a forward-looking strategy
to insure financial solvency

15:59.550 --> 16:01.984
for as long as it takes.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.079
Millennia if necessary.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.449
Oh, is that what you call

16:05.490 --> 16:08.425
buying stolen coolant
from ice rinks? Investing?

16:08.460 --> 16:10.291
I wouldn't bother denying it.

16:10.330 --> 16:12.423
Gary Weissman at Skate Pelham
already identified you.

16:12.470 --> 16:14.438
I offered him a price
for some refrigerant.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.267
I had no way of knowing

16:16.300 --> 16:18.359
that he wouldn't clear the deal
with his employer.

16:18.410 --> 16:20.275
I'm a bargain hunter,
not a criminal.

16:20.310 --> 16:21.436
HOLMES:
Ah, well,

16:21.480 --> 16:24.176
we're not here about R22,

16:24.210 --> 16:27.577
or the improper storage
of dead nutters.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.645
Allie Newmeyer

16:30.690 --> 16:33.318
was murdered two nights ago

16:33.360 --> 16:35.316
after she struck
one of your vans. Now,

16:35.360 --> 16:39.182
perhaps she got a look
at the ghastly shell game

16:39.230 --> 16:42.324
that you're playing, and you
decided to kill the witness.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.725
Wait. You think someone here...?

16:43.770 --> 16:46.261
No, we would never...

16:46.300 --> 16:47.631
You said two nights ago, right?

16:47.670 --> 16:50.104
Mm.
Two nights ago,
we were robbed.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.461
The person you're looking for
took that van.

16:52.510 --> 16:54.501
Then I'm sure we'll find
that you filed a report

16:54.540 --> 16:56.132
with the police?

16:56.180 --> 16:58.148
No. It was... complicated.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.602
But please, talk to my people.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.175
You'll see,
I'm telling the truth.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.347
MAN:
When I got in yesterday,

17:04.390 --> 17:06.449
I saw the van
wasn't here.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.082
It's a little out
of the ordinary,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.088
but every once in a while,
we'll park it at...

17:10.130 --> 17:12.325
at an off-site facility
that we maintain.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.726
It's okay, Scott.
They know about Hunts Point.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.092
BELL: Yeah, by all
means, Mr. Resnick,

17:17.130 --> 17:18.495
speak freely.

17:18.530 --> 17:20.361
You might just avoid
a hindering prosecution charge.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.833
Hey, I said we
should call you guys

17:21.870 --> 17:23.428
as soon as we realized
everything that happened.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.461
What constitutes
"everything"?

17:25.510 --> 17:27.705
There was a break-in.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.072
Uh, I came in early
to take some readings.

17:30.110 --> 17:31.771
_ I'm the chief
engineer, so normally,

17:31.810 --> 17:34.119
I'm one of the
first people here.

17:34.150 --> 17:35.617
I noticed that
somebody had kicked in

17:35.650 --> 17:37.311
the door to
the main office.

17:37.350 --> 17:39.386
Probably to get the
keys to the van.

17:39.420 --> 17:42.412
And that's when I realized
that Mr. Sullivan was missing.

17:42.460 --> 17:43.722
And who's Mr. Sullivan?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.580
Jim Sullivan--
he was interred

17:45.630 --> 17:47.552
in tank six two months ago.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.249
Wait a second.
A body was stolen,

17:49.300 --> 17:50.392
and you didn't report it?

17:50.430 --> 17:52.318
This was only yesterday,

17:52.370 --> 17:54.463
and given our new protocols
with respect to Hunts Point,

17:54.500 --> 17:57.765
there was a chance Mr. Sullivan
had simply been misplaced.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.368
I felt it was prudent

17:59.410 --> 18:01.537
to conduct a search
of all of our facilities...

18:01.580 --> 18:03.707
You felt it was prudent
to avoid a police probe

18:03.750 --> 18:05.377
of your shady
business practices.

18:05.410 --> 18:07.719
I am trying
to do the right thing here.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.877
Better late
than never.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.649
If you like, Watson
and I can look

18:11.690 --> 18:13.885
into the alleged break-in here
while you take Mr. Misraki

18:13.920 --> 18:15.478
to the station.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.817
I would ask, however,
that Mr. Resnick's interview

18:16.860 --> 18:18.384
be delayed
until we are finished,

18:18.430 --> 18:21.456
'cause we might require
his technical expertise.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.525
I told you everything I know.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.889
Yeah, and it's
great stuff.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.433
Our fraud people are gonna
want to hear it, too.

18:34.610 --> 18:36.578
So, if you could show us

18:36.610 --> 18:39.477
the almost-final resting
place of Jim Sullivan.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.645
Well?

18:46.690 --> 18:49.352
Well, what? You said you were
going for coffee an hour ago.

18:49.390 --> 18:51.255
I did go for coffee.
It wasn't very good.

18:51.290 --> 18:52.257
How have you fared?

18:52.290 --> 18:53.757
Well, as crazy as he is,

18:53.800 --> 18:55.597
everything Misraki said
checks out.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.461
Hmm. It's hardly
surprising.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.889
He seemed to think that
full candor at the 11th hour

18:59.930 --> 19:02.535
would save his company
from exposure.

19:02.570 --> 19:04.765
Theft _of the van seems a little
conveniently exculpatory though,

19:04.810 --> 19:06.368
don't you think?

19:06.410 --> 19:08.332
Well, cryoNYC kept
pretty detailed logs

19:08.380 --> 19:09.904
about when
the bodies were swapped

19:09.940 --> 19:11.578
between the tanks
and Hunts Point.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.271
They didn't have
anything scheduled

19:13.320 --> 19:14.469
within three days
of the crash.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.408
According to his files.

19:16.450 --> 19:19.487
A snake oil salesman needn't
be disbelieved in all things,

19:19.520 --> 19:22.683
but his claims _
do warrant extra scrutiny.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.426
_ It's all consistent _
With the temperature readings

19:24.460 --> 19:26.519
we took from the tanks,
the bodies.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.189
I don't think that van_was there
on company busmess.

19:30.230 --> 19:32.494
Let's say that
you're right.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.794
Allie Newmeyer's attacker
was driving a stolen vehicle.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.832
Beyond putting out a more
specific APB for the van,

19:37.870 --> 19:40.577
that suggests that our
resources are best applied

19:40.610 --> 19:43.499
to the unsolved strangulation
of Jim Sullivan.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.939
Wait. Our missing dead guy
is a murder victim?

19:45.980 --> 19:47.845
Choked to death
several months ago.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.587
I've been reviewing the
specifics with Detective Bell.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.679
Corpsicles having so little
resale value,

19:52.720 --> 19:56.349
it seems an unlikely coincidence
that the only homicide victim

19:56.390 --> 20:00.258
in cryoNYC's cold storage
was the target of our thief.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.791
So, somebody got away
with murder,

20:02.830 --> 20:05.219
but then couldn't resist
going back for a trophy?

20:05.270 --> 20:07.488
Perhaps the killer felt
some incriminating evidence

20:07.540 --> 20:09.428
had been preserved
by the irregular method

20:09.470 --> 20:10.732
of his victim's burial.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.635
Perhaps he wanted
to desecrate the corpse.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.332
No matter the motive
of the heist,

20:15.380 --> 20:17.439
I submit that solving
Jim Sullivan's murder gives us

20:17.480 --> 20:19.471
our best chance
at solvmg Allie Newmeyer's.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.508
WATSON: Strangulation is usually
a crime of passion, right?

20:24.550 --> 20:26.711
Man was a psychiatrist
attacked in his home office.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.355
Spent his days plumbing
uncomfortable truths about

20:29.390 --> 20:31.358
his patient's
most closely-held secrets,

20:31.390 --> 20:32.721
so motives abound.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.648
Yet all of his patients
appear to have solid alibis.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.258
Well, the best evidence
was physical.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.665
The killer

20:37.700 --> 20:40.533
tracked muddy size-11
boot prints into the foyer

20:40.570 --> 20:41.764
before he killed Sullivan.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.438
The M.E. thought
it looked like the work

20:43.470 --> 20:44.562
of a strong right-handed man.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.464
Well, they're out
in force lately.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.432
The lead investigator
initially fixated on the man

20:48.480 --> 20:50.573
who discovered the
body-- Vance Ford.

20:50.610 --> 20:52.703
He said he was a_first-time
patient of Sullivan's,

20:52.750 --> 20:54.672
but there was nothing
in Sullivan's files

20:54.720 --> 20:56.472
to confirm
he had an appomtment.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.488
In Ford's telling, he
happened upon the murder

20:58.520 --> 21:01.455
as it was being completed,
but was unable to catch up

21:01.490 --> 21:03.651
to the culprit
who fled on foot.

21:03.690 --> 21:06.818
Oh. Maybe because
Wyatt Earp got back

21:06.860 --> 21:09.522
into his time machine
and vanished.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.697
Needless to say,
the fact

21:10.730 --> 21:12.459
that no other
witnesses recalled

21:12.500 --> 21:14.388
such a striking figure
bolting down the street

21:14.440 --> 21:15.998
did raise a
few eyebrows.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.463
Mr. Ford was interviewed
three times,

21:18.510 --> 21:19.966
and_ he _was steadfast
in his account.

21:20.010 --> 21:22.604
And it has to be said,
he had no motive.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.608
What is it?

21:24.650 --> 21:26.470
It's crazy, but...

21:26.510 --> 21:28.717
I feel like I know him
from somewhere.

21:28.750 --> 21:29.944
Former lover?
Wouldn't be the strangest.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.016
It's like I went to
high school with him

21:32.050 --> 21:33.654
or something.

21:33.690 --> 21:36.557
Maybe he's connected to
some case we were working.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.558
After years spent staring
at suspects,

21:38.590 --> 21:40.558
the average detective
has catalogued

21:40.600 --> 21:43.569
almost every combination
of facial features.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.990
A cloud of dj vu can be
a natural byproduct.

21:47.030 --> 21:49.590
Well, I got to tag back in
on the Misraki interview.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.562
Feel free to go hunting
through mug shots

21:51.610 --> 21:53.669
if you can't shake
the feeling, all right?

21:53.710 --> 21:56.736
I think our time would be better
spent chatting with Mr. Ford.

21:56.780 --> 21:59.078
He seems a better bet _
to recall something interesting

21:59.110 --> 22:02.739
about our mystery man,
don't you think?

22:02.780 --> 22:04.088
I was heading out
when you called,

22:04.120 --> 22:05.940
but always happy
to help the police.

22:05.990 --> 22:07.617
Have a seat.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.958
You seem very eager
to get off your feet.

22:09.990 --> 22:11.582
I must ask you,
have you been

22:11.630 --> 22:13.689
in a car accident recently?

22:13.730 --> 22:15.357
I'm a subway guy,
born and raised.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.960
The limp is just...
I woke up a little sore.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.592
That should happen
less often

22:19.630 --> 22:21.495
once you're through
with the radiation.

22:21.540 --> 22:22.837
I saw your medication--
Vorinostat.

22:22.870 --> 22:24.599
I hope it's working.

22:24.640 --> 22:28.838
Relapsing acute myeloid
leukemia. Kicking my ass.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.144
Supposedly I've only
got a month, but...

22:31.180 --> 22:33.148
I'm gonna stick
until Tribeca at least.

22:33.180 --> 22:36.149
_ I'm in film_ finance. _
Finally got one in the festival.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.512
Well, we don't wish
to waste your time or ours,

22:38.550 --> 22:39.812
so I will be direct.

22:39.850 --> 22:41.511
You don't appear
physically capable

22:41.560 --> 22:43.084
of the crime _
that we're investigating,

22:43.120 --> 22:45.088
but I imagine
you were in better form

22:45.130 --> 22:46.779
when Jim Sullivan was killed.

22:46.830 --> 22:49.628
Finally,
someone comes out and asks.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.924
I knew they suspected me,
the way they kept coming back

22:51.970 --> 22:54.393
and asking why
I went there.

22:54.440 --> 22:58.103
Suppose I should've come clean,
but back then nobody knew.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.938
My oncologist said I should talk
to someone about,

23:00.980 --> 23:02.675
you know, death.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.041
Ironic, right?

23:04.080 --> 23:06.071
Anyway, I found him online.

23:06.110 --> 23:07.748
We had an appointment.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.577
The guy just didn't keep
his calendar up-to-date.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.838
So you two never met.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.448
Kind of begs the question:

23:13.490 --> 23:15.185
why the hell
would I kill him, right?

23:15.220 --> 23:17.723
I didn't.
I would tell you ifI did.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.751
Not exactly afraid
of a life sentence here.

23:19.790 --> 23:22.623
The man that you saw
fleeing the scene...

23:22.660 --> 23:23.922
They worked up a sketch.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.722
Well, you would be doing us
a great service

23:25.770 --> 23:27.863
if you could just set the stage
one more time.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.891
And, please,
leave out no details.

23:29.940 --> 23:33.569
You never know what grain
might be useful.

23:33.610 --> 23:37.501
I came up the street
just as he was walking out

23:37.550 --> 23:39.609
of Dr. Sullivan's front door.

23:39.650 --> 23:42.517
When he saw me,
he took off.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.984
He had a beard,
sort of auburn colored,

23:45.020 --> 23:46.988
and a cowboy kind of hat.

23:47.020 --> 23:49.989
Pretty sure there was a scar
over his eye.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.181
That's it.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.727
You wouldn't add
or change a thing?

23:57.770 --> 24:01.228
I asked the guy who drew that
if he did portraits.

24:01.270 --> 24:03.158
He nailed it.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.964
OREN (over phone):
Are you high?

24:06.010 --> 24:07.773
Oren, calm down.

24:07.810 --> 24:09.869
Calm down? You just accused me
of cheating on my wife.

24:09.910 --> 24:11.502
I didn't accuse you of anything.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.074
I'm just telling you
what Mom thought she saw.

24:13.110 --> 24:14.839
Well, then she's going blind.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.541
Or she's high.
No.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.047
She seemed pretty sure.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.684
She didn't see anything.
Th-There was nothing to see.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.688
I'll tell you what this is.
It's payback.

24:22.720 --> 24:23.926
I've never gotten out
of the doghouse

24:23.960 --> 24:25.552
since clad cheated on her.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.023
I didn't yell
about what a heel he is,

24:27.060 --> 24:28.755
so she thought
I was taking his side.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.791
I really don't think
that's what it is.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.092
You weren't up here last week.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.893
She could be doing this
because I forgot

24:33.940 --> 24:36.090
to change the guest towels.
The woman is nuts.

24:38.570 --> 24:40.060
"this is
what she thought she saw."

24:40.110 --> 24:42.874
No. I got to go.
Gabrielle's calling.

24:42.910 --> 24:45.743
Who never needs to hear
about this garbage. Got it?

24:45.780 --> 24:47.771
Got it.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.280
VANCE (over speakers): His
beard, it was auburn colored.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.653
And he had this cowboy hat
with a wide brim.

24:55.690 --> 24:57.829
I'm pretty sure
there was a scar over his eye.

24:57.860 --> 25:01.648
There's an 81% chance
Vance Ford is lying

25:01.700 --> 25:03.793
_ _ about his role
in Jim Sullivan's murder.

25:03.830 --> 25:04.967
You taped our meeting?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.888
No. What you've just heard

25:06.930 --> 25:08.795
is a recording of the second
of three interviews

25:08.840 --> 25:11.900
that the police conducted
with Mr. Ford.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.703
It only sounds like
our meeting today

25:13.740 --> 25:16.675
because he hewed so closely
to his original description.

25:16.710 --> 25:19.270
There's virtually no variance
in each of his accounts.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.846
His story never changes.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.916
Ergo, lying.

25:22.950 --> 25:24.212
Well, if he was
telling the truth,

25:24.250 --> 25:25.979
then why would you
expect it to change?

25:26.020 --> 25:28.659
Our meeting today brought
to mind this recent study

25:28.690 --> 25:30.282
by a group
of psychologists.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.289
They found that counting
the number of unique words used

25:33.330 --> 25:36.891
by witnesses was an exceptional
lie detection technique.

25:36.930 --> 25:39.125
Liars stick
to streamlined stories.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.889
(kettle whistling)
They don't deviate
from the linguistic avenues

25:41.940 --> 25:44.135
they've already mapped out
in their original telling.

25:44.170 --> 25:45.899
They use fewer words

25:45.940 --> 25:49.137
and particularly ones
that evoke sense memory.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.876
Because they're not drawing
from memory.

25:51.910 --> 25:54.049
Law enforcement agencies
pour considerable resources

25:54.080 --> 25:56.048
into the study
of microexpressions

25:56.080 --> 25:58.219
and into polygraph technology,

25:58.250 --> 26:00.889
but no matter how finely
they measure facial tics

26:00.920 --> 26:04.151
and heart rates, they rarely
do better than a coin flip.

26:04.190 --> 26:07.591
Tallying singular words
may be the best way

26:07.630 --> 26:09.951
to root out liars
such as Mr. Ford.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.820
And it's absolutely free.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.895
(sighs)

26:14.940 --> 26:17.829
A significant development
in our case

26:17.870 --> 26:19.838
and a revolutionary breakthrough
in our field.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.338
And you could not be more bored.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.348
(sighs)
I'm distracted.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.974
I just got off the phone
with Oren.

26:27.010 --> 26:29.319
Denied having the affair.

26:29.350 --> 26:33.980
And he used plenty of words,
in case you're wondering.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.784
And I think he was ready
to use a lot more

26:36.820 --> 26:38.026
to describe my mother.

26:38.060 --> 26:41.689
You believe him?

26:41.730 --> 26:45.029
Well, like you said, he's not
really the affair-having type.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.698
So these other words he would
use to describe your mother,

26:47.740 --> 26:48.866
would "forgetful"
be one of them?

26:48.900 --> 26:51.209
What do you mean?

26:51.240 --> 26:53.834
When I was in
London last summer,

26:53.880 --> 26:55.905
I received two phone
calls from her.

26:55.940 --> 26:58.204
The first one, she was
trying to track you down.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.206
She was unaware that I
was no longer state5ide.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.013
The second one
was one week later.

27:02.050 --> 27:05.281
Before the question was out
of her mouth, she admitted

27:05.320 --> 27:07.811
that my move had
slipped her mind.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.283
I assumed you just
hadn't mentioned it,

27:10.320 --> 27:12.356
thought she'd only
forgotten once.

27:12.390 --> 27:15.188
No, I told her you went to
London the day after you left.

27:15.230 --> 27:18.119
Your mother's in her
late 605, correct?

27:18.170 --> 27:19.967
Yeah, 68.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.399
Still pretty early
for Alzheimer's or dementia,

27:21.440 --> 27:23.135
if that's what you're thinking.

27:23.170 --> 27:26.901
General cognitive decline is
usually underway at that point.

27:26.940 --> 27:28.931
Bits of memory loss.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.006
I mean, it might not be so
dire as a chronic case, but...

27:32.050 --> 27:34.712
could explain why she's
mistaken about Oren.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.210
No, she was sure.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.979
And you know how she is.
She's...

27:39.020 --> 27:41.011
She's razor sharp.
She's your mother.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.949
I'm not suggesting she's
gripped by fantasies.

27:43.990 --> 27:46.686
But she might have transposed
Oren into the memory

27:46.730 --> 27:48.197
_ _of someone else
kissmg a blonde woman.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.321
(phone ringing)

27:53.800 --> 27:55.233
Detective.

27:55.270 --> 27:56.794
BELL:
Hey, you guys talked to

27:56.840 --> 27:58.159
Vance Ford
this afternoon, right?

27:58.210 --> 28:00.098
Did you see anything
that set off your antennae?

28:00.140 --> 28:01.402
No, but we heard plenty
of things

28:01.440 --> 28:03.169
that were very suspicious.

28:03.210 --> 28:06.145
He spun a too-familiar yarn
about a bearded cowboy killer.

28:06.180 --> 28:08.410
Well, I hope you got
a good description.

28:08.450 --> 28:11.248
There's a chance _
that the same perp struck again.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.054
Vance Ford was strangled
tonight.

28:14.090 --> 28:16.411
It looks just like
the Jim Sullivan murder.

28:21.030 --> 28:23.294
BELL:
Jim Sullivan. Vance Ford.

28:23.330 --> 28:25.491
I'm thinking about putting
stickers on these photos

28:25.530 --> 28:27.930
to keep them straight.

28:27.970 --> 28:31.235
Sullivan's home has
French Colonial flourishes.

28:31.270 --> 28:34.808
Ford's is a juvenile paean
to pop culture obsession.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.035
My point is there are a lot of
similarities between the crimes.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.049
You don't see men strangled to
death by bare hands too often.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.945
GREGSON: No forced entry,
not enough evidence

28:41.980 --> 28:44.517
to suggest a long
fight at either scene.

28:44.550 --> 28:48.486
Looks like both guys were
surprised by someone they knew.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.920
One notable dissimilarity
is that the scene

28:50.960 --> 28:52.928
of Ford's murder is pristine.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.326
Sullivan's killer, meanwhile,
tracked his size 11 prints

28:55.360 --> 28:57.294
everywhere.

28:57.330 --> 28:59.264
BELL: Maybe he's learned
from his mistakes.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.439
My point is that we should
remain open to the possibility

29:01.470 --> 29:03.438
this is the work
of two different killers.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.335
GREGSON: If it wasn't, Ford
just got proven innocent

29:05.370 --> 29:07.975
of the Sullivan murder,
in the worst possible way.

29:08.010 --> 29:09.875
(phone vibrates)

29:09.910 --> 29:11.377
No Joan today?

29:11.410 --> 29:14.516
She has a familial obligation.
She'll join us shortly.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.814
You should tell her we may not
be here at the station.

29:16.850 --> 29:18.909
We got guys rolling on
a 10-24 at cryoNYC.

29:18.950 --> 29:21.350
Somebody there called 911.

29:21.390 --> 29:22.914
An intruder in the crypt

29:22.960 --> 29:25.053
_ knocked one of _
their engineers unconSCIous.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.892
So it might be time for some,
uh, surveillance cameras

29:33.940 --> 29:35.567
and some new locks, Mr. Resnick.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.001
We saw the ambulance
leavmg on our way in.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.008
The guy who got hit,
he gonna be okay?

29:41.040 --> 29:42.837
Ryan Lee.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.370
Yeah. My partner's
riding with him.

29:44.410 --> 29:46.401
He was coming around. I thought
we'd get a full statement.

29:46.450 --> 29:49.544
So when we left yesterday, this
place was a sealed crime scene.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.411
Today you're back
hosting an open house?

29:51.450 --> 29:53.213
The lawyers cleared it.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.411
Somebody has to come in
and maintain the cryostats.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.916
Ryan and I

29:56.960 --> 29:59.428
came in early to check gauges,
make sure nothing

29:59.460 --> 30:01.519
had been disturbed by the police
who'd been poking around.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.118
All of a sudden,

30:03.160 --> 30:05.469
we heard something
from behind this tank.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.525
Someone was tampering
with the tank

30:07.570 --> 30:09.435
that used to house Jim Sullivan?

30:09.470 --> 30:12.268
When we went to check it out,
this guy came out of nowhere

30:12.310 --> 30:14.039
and whacked Ryan in the head.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.433
He hit him with a wrench.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.572
I-I thought
he might kill him.

30:16.610 --> 30:17.599
Then what happened?

30:17.640 --> 30:19.244
Uh, I shoved the guy,

30:19.280 --> 30:21.145
and he swung at me,
but he missed.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.943
He hit the side of the tank.

30:22.980 --> 30:24.982
Yeah.

30:25.020 --> 30:27.318
And then he took off.

30:27.350 --> 30:28.908
Ran out the fire exit.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.451
He leave any scratches,
any other marks on you?

30:31.490 --> 30:33.481
No, but you got a
good look at him?

30:33.530 --> 30:35.555
Both of us.
He's a white guy.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.921
Late 305,
ifI had to guess.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.325
Sort of
a wispy brown beard.

30:40.370 --> 30:43.339
And I couldn't be sure, because
he was wearing this weird hat,

30:43.370 --> 30:45.133
but I think he had a scar
over his eye.

30:45.170 --> 30:46.398
Right here.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.601
OFFICER:
His friend was pretty groggy,

30:48.640 --> 30:49.629
but he gave us
the same description

30:49.680 --> 30:51.443
before we sent him
to the hospital.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.146
SCOTT:
That's him.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.341
You know who he is?

30:57.380 --> 31:00.247
We're familiar
with his work.

31:00.290 --> 31:02.258
MARY_:
I promise

31:02.290 --> 31:05.327
I'm not trying to get back
at you for being late on Monday.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.554
The cable was out,

31:06.590 --> 31:08.558
and dealing with those people
is a nightmare.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.420
I had to wait. I'm sorry.

31:10.460 --> 31:12.064
You should've ordered.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.068
It's no problem.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.465
Is everything all right?

31:15.500 --> 31:17.263
Did you talk to Oren?

31:17.300 --> 31:18.904
I did. He denied it.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.362
He said it never happened.

31:20.410 --> 31:22.605
Well, I guess
that's to be expected.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.244
This is so frustrating.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.248
I really don't know what to do.

31:26.280 --> 31:30.410
I have to ask, are you sure
it was Oren you saw?

31:30.450 --> 31:32.281
What do you mean? Of course.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.515
Uh, you know what,
we just need another minute.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.448
Thanks.

31:36.490 --> 31:38.583
If you think
you've done what you can do,

31:38.630 --> 31:40.518
then you've done
what you can do.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.619
Thank you for trying.

31:44.330 --> 31:48.039
So what was it you ordered
last time that looked good?

31:48.070 --> 31:50.129
You're testing me.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.660
What?

31:51.710 --> 31:53.701
I used to do the same thing
with my mother.

31:53.740 --> 31:55.401
You don't believe me about Oren.

31:55.440 --> 31:58.546
You think I'm confused.
You're wrong.

31:58.580 --> 32:01.549
You're not a doctor anymore,
and I'm not your patient.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.116
No, I'm not a doctor anymore,

32:03.150 --> 32:05.015
but I do think
you should see one.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.608
There's some easy tests
they can run.

32:06.650 --> 32:10.051
We're not discussing this.

32:10.090 --> 32:11.523
I spoke to Dad.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.653
He said that you don't
like to talk about it,

32:13.690 --> 32:15.624
but you've been forgetting
where you put things.

32:15.660 --> 32:18.026
My keys, once.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.129
He said it was more than that.

32:20.170 --> 32:22.991
(sighs)
This is ridiculous.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.031
He has more senior moments
than I do.

32:25.070 --> 32:26.503
You're gonna have them,
too, someday.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.371
It happens to everyone.

32:28.410 --> 32:30.708
It doesn't mean that I can't
be trusted to remember

32:30.740 --> 32:32.605
my own son
disgracing his marriage.

32:32.650 --> 32:34.242
Mom...

32:34.280 --> 32:35.713
Forget it.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.218
I'm not gonna
sit here and be ambushed.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.241
Mom, please, I...

32:46.460 --> 32:48.599
I wonder what
a psychiatrist would make

32:48.630 --> 32:50.427
of the temptation
to use this software

32:50.460 --> 32:52.667
to turn a violent criminal's
face into one's own.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.588
I could take a guess.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.596
So the cryoNYC
guys were not able

32:56.640 --> 32:58.403
to improve on
Ford's sketch?

32:58.440 --> 33:01.671
Given how prolific this man's
been over the last two days--

33:01.710 --> 33:04.270
let alone two months-- _
I assumed he would have priors.

33:04.310 --> 33:07.643
But if he does have a record,
I've been unable to find it.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.671
Even with
the modifications

33:09.720 --> 33:11.642
to his various features,
I've been unable to generate

33:11.690 --> 33:15.751
a facial recognition match
to anyone in the NYPD database.

33:15.790 --> 33:16.586
Well, yesterday you thought

33:16.620 --> 33:18.485
Vance Ford was lying
about this guy.

33:18.530 --> 33:21.328
Mm. Today Vance Ford is dead.
And if memory serves,

33:21.360 --> 33:23.453
I said there was
an 81% chance he was lying,

33:23.500 --> 33:25.695
which means there's a 19% chance
he was telling the truth.

33:25.730 --> 33:28.494
Something about
this guy's face.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.735
If the witnesses at cryoNYC
hadn't been so certain,

33:30.770 --> 33:32.658
I'd say that your mind
was playing tricks on you.

33:32.710 --> 33:35.372
(sighs)
Well, maybe it is.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.776
There's a happy thought.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.779
Didn't go well with your mother.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.744
Well, I shouldn't be surprised.
I mean, I've seen it before

33:42.780 --> 33:45.044
with patients.
Mental health care is triclq.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.479
You know, you see
these families

33:47.520 --> 33:49.317
battling with one another,
you know?

33:49.360 --> 33:51.225
Trying to convince
their loved ones to accept help.

33:51.260 --> 33:53.228
I really don't
want that battle.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.488
Surely your stepfather
could persuade her

33:54.530 --> 33:56.122
to see a specialist.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.367
He convinced my mother
to order breadsticks once

33:58.400 --> 34:00.493
with our pizza-- I
think we were watching

34:00.530 --> 34:01.838
a new episode of MASH.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.758
So there's him
and then there's my brother,

34:03.800 --> 34:06.598
who's furious with her
and 500 miles away.
(phone chimes)

34:06.640 --> 34:08.733
I think I'm on
my own here.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.736
Sorry. Uh, we're
cordially invited

34:10.780 --> 34:13.305
to review the autopsy
results of Vance Ford.

34:13.350 --> 34:16.319
If you're still in the mind
to find solace in work.

34:18.850 --> 34:21.045
(elevator bell dings)

34:24.660 --> 34:27.754
Already used the cyanoacrylate
fuming wand you like.

34:27.790 --> 34:30.156
Didn't turn up any
prints around his neck.

34:30.200 --> 34:33.624
I can, however, answer the
question you called about.

34:33.670 --> 34:36.434
No way this guy killed
Allie Newmeyer.

34:36.470 --> 34:39.234
Yeah, we were pretty sure about
that the moment we saw him.

34:39.270 --> 34:40.760
Well, now it's
official.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.732
Leukemia would have
taken him soon

34:42.780 --> 34:45.305
if he hadn't
been strangled.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.306
You don't see blood labs
like this very often

34:47.350 --> 34:48.749
outside of_ academic
medicme.

34:48.780 --> 34:51.681
His white blood cell
count was 312.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.720
Explains why the bruising
is so bad, too.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.819
It explains
some of the bruising.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.794
HAWES: You noticed
the feet, too, huh?

35:01.830 --> 35:03.718
I was thinking maybe
it was some kind of, uh,

35:03.760 --> 35:05.899
weird double lividity,
but coroner's assistant

35:05.930 --> 35:08.364
swears they kept him level
in the van.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.563
Actually, the explanation
is much simpler.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.602
This man was a liar
and a killer after all.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.339
So you're saying Vance Ford
didn't just kill Jim Sullivan

35:24.390 --> 35:27.211
two months ago,
he also stole his shoes?

35:27.250 --> 35:28.854
All it took to get
away with murder.

35:28.890 --> 35:31.154
You'll recall the
killer had tracked

35:31.190 --> 35:33.852
size-11 boot prints
all over Sullivan's foyer.

35:33.890 --> 35:36.324
WATSON: Now, maybe Ford was in
a hurry because the neighbors

35:36.360 --> 35:38.169
heard the struggle,
or maybe he was worried

35:38.200 --> 35:40.668
he was gonna miss a spot
if he cleaned the scene.

35:40.700 --> 35:43.362
Either way,
he saw an opportunity.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.561
He put on this pair
of Sullivan's smaller shoes

35:45.610 --> 35:47.760
and then made a show
of discovering the body.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.199
We found these
size 11 shoes

35:50.240 --> 35:52.902
at Ford's home--
his closet was full of them.

35:52.950 --> 35:57.239
When we met him, he was wearing
these size-nine loafers.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.885
It registered
when I noticed his limp.

35:59.920 --> 36:03.253
It's a mature choice for a _man
of such juvenile aesthetics.

36:03.290 --> 36:05.178
But it's difficult to match
your look when you shop

36:05.230 --> 36:06.822
in a dead man's wardrobe.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.828
So we think that Ford
squeezed into these loafers

36:08.860 --> 36:10.623
whenever he met with police.

36:10.660 --> 36:13.959
These bruises are
the price he paid

36:14.000 --> 36:17.231
for sticking
to his story.

36:17.270 --> 36:20.205
Maybe. Maybe not.
It's not like we can ask him.

36:20.240 --> 36:23.437
No need. We believe we may have
uncovered his motive.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.948
What would posses a man
dying of leukemia

36:25.980 --> 36:27.709
to kill a complete stranger?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.718
WATSON:
We had a hunch,

36:29.750 --> 36:31.843
so we asked the lab
to test their DNA.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.346
Sullivan was a bone marrow match

36:33.390 --> 36:34.948
for Ford.

36:34.990 --> 36:37.288
HOLMES: Underneath not one
but two name changes

36:37.320 --> 36:41.950
at the county clerk's office,
we uncovered an explanation.

36:43.930 --> 36:46.228
They are estranged cousins.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.397
So one side of the family
doesn't like the other.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.000
Sullivan doesn't want to go
through a painful procedure

36:51.040 --> 36:53.929
to give up his marrow, but Ford
won't take no for an answer.

36:53.970 --> 36:57.007
It's a crime of passion,
as Watson said.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.940
Now, Ford continued
to deteriorate.

36:58.980 --> 37:01.847
All seemed lost,
until he discovered

37:01.880 --> 37:04.986
that his victim was interred
at cryoNYC.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.647
Now, bone marrow and stem cells

37:06.690 --> 37:08.658
are cryogenically frozen
all the time.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.612
So you think Ford
was behind the theft

37:10.660 --> 37:12.719
at cryoNYC, too?

37:12.760 --> 37:14.455
Behind, but not capable.
He would need help

37:14.500 --> 37:16.252
to pull a corpse
out of a cryotank,

37:16.300 --> 37:18.393
and he'd need an expert
to harvest the marrow.

37:18.430 --> 37:20.728
Our friend with the cowboy hat.

37:20.770 --> 37:23.398
I'm now quite certain he doesn't
exist. Ford made him up.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.329
Then who?
The two techs at cryoNYC.

37:26.370 --> 37:29.339
The ones who claimed
they were attacked by this man.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.631
Ford paid them

37:30.680 --> 37:32.272
to help harvest the bone marrow.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.915
One or both of them ran into
trouble the other night

37:34.950 --> 37:36.747
when Allie Newmeyer
struck their van.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.486
She had to die.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.784
We think they were worried about
Ford clearing his conscience

37:40.820 --> 37:43.482
before he died, so they cut
his time even shorter.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.784
And then they piggybacked
onto the boogeyman he described

37:45.830 --> 37:48.321
two months ago,
kept us chasing our tails.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.624
It's interesting.

37:50.660 --> 37:54.027
But I don't see us
getting a warrant off of it.

37:54.070 --> 37:57.528
Not unless one of the techs you
like just hands us something.

37:57.570 --> 38:00.437
Oh, my God,
I know who he is now--

38:00.470 --> 38:03.007
cowboy hat.
GREGSON: Am I crazy,

38:03.040 --> 38:04.974
or did your partner not
just say that Ford made him up?

38:05.010 --> 38:07.342
No, you were wrong;
he's real.

38:08.110 --> 38:10.317
Sort of. And...

38:10.350 --> 38:12.386
I think he can help us.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.388
SCOTT:
Oh, my God.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.389
Yeah. You can see why we
think we're onto something.

38:18.430 --> 38:21.058
Our colleagues are at the
hospital checking with Mr. Lee,

38:21.090 --> 38:24.765
but we hope you'll be
able to make the ID.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.768
His testimony will be
worth less at trial

38:26.800 --> 38:27.892
'cause of his
concu55ion.

38:30.570 --> 38:33.801
I know you could probably put
a lot of people in that hat,

38:33.840 --> 38:37.401
give them a beard,
but it's the eyes.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.375
I'll never forget the way
he looked when he came at Ryan

38:40.410 --> 38:43.345
with that wrench in his hand.

38:43.380 --> 38:45.484
That's him.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.488
You're absolutely
positive?

38:47.520 --> 38:48.782
Hundred percent.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.428
What?

38:51.460 --> 38:52.825
WATSON:
You just I.D.'d

38:52.860 --> 38:54.851
a man named John Reynolds,
an actor.

38:56.130 --> 38:58.121
This isn't really a mug shot,

38:58.160 --> 38:59.798
it's a still_
from a mowe.

38:59.830 --> 39:02.435
Manos: Hands of Fate.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.097
He played a character
named Torgo.

39:06.570 --> 39:08.470
What?
Manos might be

39:08.510 --> 39:10.034
the worst movie of all time,

39:10.080 --> 39:11.968
_ so of course _
it has a cult followmg.

39:12.010 --> 39:14.046
My brother
always got a kick out of it.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.445
He was a movie nerd.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.038
Now, it's been
bothering me

39:17.080 --> 39:19.719
since_I saw it
at your friend's house.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.889
He liked B movies, too.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.717
What the hell
are you talking about?

39:23.760 --> 39:25.978
What friend?
BELL:
Vance Ford.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.420
Now, this man-- the one you
just pinned your crime on--

39:29.460 --> 39:31.428
died in 1966.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.097
WATSON: When Ford was
asked to describe

39:33.130 --> 39:36.395
Jim Sullivan's killer,
he picked a face he knew well.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.601
It's a good strategy
for a liar.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.164
Helped him keep his
story consistent.

39:40.210 --> 39:41.768
You were kind enough

39:41.810 --> 39:43.573
to allow us to
tape this meeting.

39:43.610 --> 39:45.475
We're pretty sure it's
going to be enough

39:45.510 --> 39:48.070
to get us a warrant to search
your home and Mr. Lee's.

39:48.110 --> 39:50.510
Maybe we'll find the
money Ford paid you.

39:50.550 --> 39:53.439
Hell, maybe we'll even find
Dr. Sullivan's remains.

39:53.490 --> 39:54.752
They still haven't
turned up.

39:54.790 --> 39:57.759
This is nuts.

40:00.130 --> 40:01.791
after you killed Ford.

40:01.830 --> 40:04.492
Not sure how you figured out
which one of you was gonna

40:04.530 --> 40:06.964
hit the other with the wrench,
but since he's the one

40:07.000 --> 40:09.798
in the hospital, I'm guessing
he's not quite as sharp as you.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.091
WATSON:
We're curious--

40:11.140 --> 40:12.630
when our colleagues
tell him the truth

40:12.670 --> 40:14.206
about the man in the sketch,

40:14.240 --> 40:16.105
when they explain
that the first person to testify

40:16.140 --> 40:18.131
against the other
will be able to cut a deal

40:18.180 --> 40:20.478
with the D.A.'s office,

40:20.510 --> 40:22.614
do you think
he'll stick to the script,

40:22.650 --> 40:24.686
or do you think
he'll save himself?

40:27.590 --> 40:29.808
Chew on it,
Mr. Resnick.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.487
We'll be back
in a while.

40:33.990 --> 40:35.799
Leave it on.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.494
There's more I want to tell you.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.232
You texted?

40:48.270 --> 40:49.669
Been shopping?

40:49.710 --> 40:51.940
Yeah, it's a make-up present
for my mother.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.777
IfI can get her
to pick up the phone,

40:53.810 --> 40:55.016
I'm gonna try
and talk to her again.

40:55.050 --> 40:56.745
I thought a spoonful of sugar.

40:56.780 --> 40:59.180
I've always found a
crowbar more effective.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.211
But do as you wish.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.751
She should be here
momentarily.

41:02.790 --> 41:05.179
What?
You were wrong, Watson.

41:05.230 --> 41:08.529
You needn't take care of your
mother's care on your own.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.563
You have a larger family
than you imagined.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.761
Anyway, I don't want you
shirking off our work.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.735
That's a pretty selfish way
to phrase a generous offer.

41:16.770 --> 41:18.192
What happened
to cutting the cord?

41:18.240 --> 41:20.504
I like Mary.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.679
No, I appreciate that, but
you don't know her like I do.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.541
I mean, she's not
gonna just, you know...

41:24.580 --> 41:26.605
Mary!

41:26.650 --> 41:28.618
Act naturally.

41:28.650 --> 41:30.709
We're taking her to see an
acquaintance at St. Bede's.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.547
What acquaintance?
Neurologist.

41:32.590 --> 41:34.217
Okay, does she know that?
Of course she does.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.252
How did you get her to, uh...

41:36.290 --> 41:38.178
I called her up earlier
and I convinced her

41:38.220 --> 41:39.858
that she'd forgotten your
birthday the other month.

41:39.890 --> 41:41.699
But she didn't. She got me
that scarf you ruined.

41:41.730 --> 41:43.789
HOLMES: I convinced her
that she did not.

41:43.830 --> 41:45.695
Took some doing,
mind you.

41:45.730 --> 41:49.860
In the end, and for her
own good, I prevailed.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.765
That's pretty cruel,
actually.

41:51.810 --> 41:58.079
Crowbar, Watson. That's
how we do it in my family.

41:58.110 --> 41:59.805
Hi, Mom.
