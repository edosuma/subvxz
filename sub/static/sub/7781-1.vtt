Let us always be together.

02:16.669 --> 02:19.069
That's it, Jin-sung.
Like that.

02:24.377 --> 02:27.107
Very good, that's the way.

02:27.614 --> 02:30.742
Relax your arm, relax

02:31.017 --> 02:33.781
- So-hee, cue
- Yes

03:20.967 --> 03:22.457
What if we're caught?

03:22.769 --> 03:24.396
It's not our major anyway.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.127
But what if he tells Ms. Muhn?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.564
Say you took me to the hospital.

03:28.708 --> 03:29.732
That's ridiculous.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.312
You're the one who wanted
to see the concert

03:33.546 --> 03:35.070
What are you so worried about?

03:36.519 --> 03:38.180
Jin-sung, are you coming?

03:38.220 --> 03:38.686
No.

03:39.321 --> 03:40.549
Don't make me laugh.
Come on.

03:42.725 --> 03:43.419
You two there

03:46.028 --> 03:46.551
Hey!

03:46.942 --> 03:51.845
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you...

03:52.547 --> 03:55.015
Happy birthday, dear Hae-ju

03:56.485 --> 04:00.444
Happy birthday to you.

04:05.394 --> 04:06.122
No

04:08.730 --> 04:10.561
It's fattening.

04:15.137 --> 04:16.832
Only for today.

04:18.940 --> 04:22.069
My favorite cream cake.

04:27.950 --> 04:29.815
Happy birthday, Hae-ju.

04:36.024 --> 04:37.286
My pretty's shoes.

05:15.597 --> 05:19.192
What are you doing here?
What're you hiding?

05:22.070 --> 05:22.968
It's your birthday?

05:24.072 --> 05:25.539
You ate the whole cake?

05:27.509 --> 05:29.101
That's why you're so fat.

05:30.245 --> 05:33.078
Look in the mirror.
It's pretty serious.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.748
How long have you been
coming here?

05:42.758 --> 05:44.089
Let's use it together
from now on.

05:51.666 --> 05:53.293
But doesn't it smell in here?

05:55.737 --> 05:56.863
Is it pork fat?

05:59.107 --> 06:00.199
You preparing for the art show?

06:03.612 --> 06:04.601
The fox's stairs.

06:06.748 --> 06:07.942
That make your wish come true...

06:10.585 --> 06:11.279
How childish.

06:15.023 --> 06:20.359
It's true. If the 29th stair
appears, it grants your wish.

06:21.596 --> 06:22.528
You believe that?

06:22.731 --> 06:23.197
Why not?

06:23.932 --> 06:24.660
Have you heard?

06:25.867 --> 06:29.633
If you wish real hard,
the fox listens out of pity.

06:34.509 --> 06:35.635
What do you wish for?

06:37.679 --> 06:39.613
To be a famous ballerina?

06:42.084 --> 06:44.245
All I want is you.

06:44.619 --> 06:46.746
What the heck?

06:47.889 --> 06:48.548
It's my mom.

06:49.691 --> 06:51.591
You're dead. Go on.

06:51.693 --> 06:52.523
You go first.

06:52.661 --> 06:53.992
- Hurry up.
- Hurry

06:55.030 --> 06:55.792
See you tomorrow

07:03.538 --> 07:08.168
So-hee, thanks for the concert

07:09.711 --> 07:10.609
I love you.

07:31.299 --> 07:32.926
Do you have gym clothes?

07:35.170 --> 07:36.569
Don't forget next time.

07:36.738 --> 07:39.730
All right. Why don't you
wash them?

07:41.977 --> 07:44.036
You see?

07:44.846 --> 07:47.576
Nah, she's lying. Right?

07:49.851 --> 07:52.115
See? You're dead.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.319
Looking for someone?

08:04.332 --> 08:06.664
They won't fit me, but...

08:06.968 --> 08:08.492
What?

08:11.072 --> 08:12.767
I have gym class next...

08:13.141 --> 08:16.167
Gym clothes? Take mine.

08:17.379 --> 08:18.073
So cute.

08:21.516 --> 08:26.886
One, two, three, four...

08:31.993 --> 08:35.827
Her pants are bursting
There are diet pills for that...

08:36.131 --> 08:37.256
Stop it

08:37.999 --> 08:39.260
Hey, your pants ripped.

08:46.708 --> 08:48.835
Can't you girls run properly?

08:49.010 --> 08:53.242
In time. One, two...

08:53.785 --> 08:55.082
Good afternoon

08:58.756 --> 08:59.620
Good afternoon

09:00.057 --> 09:01.957
Hey, put your hair up.

09:17.108 --> 09:19.941
Jin-sung, what's your problem?

09:20.445 --> 09:22.436
Who told you to skip class
and see a concert?

09:24.182 --> 09:26.980
I kept praising you, so
your head started to swell?

09:30.922 --> 09:32.856
A lot of girls are
as good as you.

09:34.892 --> 09:37.190
What did I tell you
was most important?

09:38.696 --> 09:39.492
Practice

09:40.765 --> 09:42.960
With your body, you need to
practice till it kills you.

09:44.735 --> 09:46.100
That goes for all of you.

09:49.407 --> 09:52.342
Teacher...

09:53.144 --> 09:53.735
What now?

09:57.248 --> 09:59.216
Jin-sung didn't want to...

10:00.651 --> 10:03.381
I forced her to go.

10:09.227 --> 10:11.457
You girls are taking me
for a ride.

10:13.264 --> 10:16.756
So-hee, is your leg okay?
You can stop seeing a doctor?

10:52.463 --> 10:54.431
- Hello?
- Hello?

10:55.999 --> 10:57.296
- Where are you?
- Hello?

10:57.901 --> 10:58.993
Where are you?

11:00.070 --> 11:01.594
I'm in the dorm.

11:01.839 --> 11:02.430
What are you doing?

11:03.440 --> 11:04.304
Hello?

11:04.441 --> 11:05.305
Hello?

11:05.709 --> 11:08.177
So-hee, I can't hear you.

11:08.879 --> 11:09.743
Hello?

11:10.848 --> 11:11.542
Hello?

11:11.715 --> 11:12.545
I guess she can't hear.

11:13.117 --> 11:14.414
- Hello?
- Hello?

12:01.198 --> 12:01.994
Jin-sung

12:03.567 --> 12:04.534
Hey

12:05.302 --> 12:06.098
Quiet.

12:09.940 --> 12:11.066
Grab me.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.866
- You scared me
- Quiet

12:16.180 --> 12:17.169
I snuck out of home

12:17.314 --> 12:18.872
What's with you?

12:21.785 --> 12:22.843
It's okay if I sleep here?

12:35.065 --> 12:36.157
Why are you so scared?

12:42.973 --> 12:44.065
Oh, my stomach.

12:48.445 --> 12:50.606
You know why my mom
made me take ballet?

12:52.049 --> 12:56.076
She always wanted to do it,
so now I have to.

12:57.554 --> 13:01.115
Wish I could live somewhere
without mom or ballet.

13:03.293 --> 13:06.319
When we turn 20,
let's live together.

13:07.965 --> 13:08.659
Okay?

13:10.367 --> 13:13.564
Hey, answer me.

13:13.904 --> 13:14.962
All right.

13:17.674 --> 13:18.333
You're done.

13:24.014 --> 13:27.711
Hey, what the hell?

13:27.951 --> 13:31.853
I've always had
potential as a stylist.

13:32.189 --> 13:33.417
- You'll drive me crazy.
- Let's take a picture.

13:34.391 --> 13:37.292
- Looking like this?
- It's pretty

13:37.461 --> 13:38.189
Here I go.

14:03.487 --> 14:06.513
Bored? Eat some more.

14:06.923 --> 14:09.824
I won't leave you,
we're friends forever.

14:12.896 --> 14:13.419
You too.

14:21.938 --> 14:23.906
Bored? Eat some more.

14:24.107 --> 14:26.735
I won't leave you,
we're friends forever.

14:30.447 --> 14:31.937
Fifteen

14:32.482 --> 14:33.847
sixteen

14:34.584 --> 14:35.516
twenty-seven

14:36.953 --> 14:38.147
twenty-eight

14:39.856 --> 14:41.153
Twenty-nine?

14:41.758 --> 14:44.192
Fox, fox, please
grant my wish.

14:44.828 --> 14:46.625
Make me lose weight...

14:46.997 --> 14:47.929
Ta-dah

14:50.367 --> 14:51.129
Jin-sung.

14:52.402 --> 14:56.736
Actually... I'm happiest
when doing ballet.

15:00.577 --> 15:04.604
In ten years, we'll be at
London Opera House.

15:07.651 --> 15:11.485
I'll be Giselle,
and you'll be Albrecht.

15:14.091 --> 15:16.423
It'll be gorgeous, won't it?

15:19.296 --> 15:22.197
I'm going home.
See you at school.

15:29.906 --> 15:33.637
Why am I Albrecht?
I'll be Giselle.

15:36.580 --> 15:37.842
Did you see the notice?

15:38.682 --> 15:40.445
Only one person from
our school can go.

15:40.884 --> 15:44.479
If you win the competition, you
go to a Russian ballet school.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.788
You'll try? Take a look.

15:53.764 --> 15:57.359
If you just do well at Giselle,
the prize is yours.

15:57.801 --> 15:58.597
You can do it.

16:00.437 --> 16:04.737
Technique's important, but
you need emotion for Giselle.

16:05.442 --> 16:06.841
You're good at that.

16:08.545 --> 16:11.070
You've got the fundamentals,
so if you prepare,

16:11.681 --> 16:13.114
I hope you can go.

16:15.485 --> 16:17.783
Why do you fool around
with Jin-sung these days?

16:18.789 --> 16:20.848
Is your leg healed?
Let me look.

16:24.594 --> 16:28.530
Crybaby. Your mom
said you were all better.

16:29.533 --> 16:30.431
Is your mother well?

16:30.934 --> 16:31.332
Yes

16:31.668 --> 16:34.330
So-hee, give this
to your mom.

17:26.122 --> 17:29.455
Jin-sung, did I scare you?

17:32.929 --> 17:35.090
Our little Jin-sung...

17:40.537 --> 17:43.233
Where were you?
I looked all over.

17:44.975 --> 17:47.739
Let's have a chat, okay?

17:49.913 --> 17:50.709
Just a minute.

17:54.017 --> 17:54.711
Hello?

17:56.119 --> 17:59.213
Yeah. Okay, mom.

18:02.058 --> 18:02.490
Yeah.

18:03.393 --> 18:06.726
It's all worked out.

18:23.523 --> 18:26.048
Hey, you scared me.

18:30.630 --> 18:31.392
Why are you laughing?

18:33.533 --> 18:34.431
Sorry.

18:55.054 --> 18:57.488
I look different, don't I?

18:59.359 --> 19:01.919
It's not just looking different.

19:03.763 --> 19:06.129
You lost a ton of weight.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.362
You look real pretty now.

19:14.407 --> 19:15.499
Did you make this?

19:17.877 --> 19:22.337
The fox's stairs in
front of the dorm, right?

19:27.553 --> 19:29.453
They say your wish comes true,

19:30.490 --> 19:32.355
if the 29th step appears.

19:36.262 --> 19:39.390
That stairway was the
first thing to listen to me.

19:41.434 --> 19:47.270
It believed me,
and granted my wish.

19:50.710 --> 19:52.473
So I believe in the stairs.

19:54.947 --> 19:56.141
If you give your heart to it,

19:57.984 --> 20:02.011
the 29th step will really appear,

20:03.790 --> 20:06.725
and grant your wish.

20:11.731 --> 20:12.925
You really believe that?

20:13.966 --> 20:19.268
I begged for it to
make me lose weight.

20:38.991 --> 20:41.289
Oh god, my toe
shoes are gone

20:41.394 --> 20:42.861
What? Look harder.

20:48.101 --> 20:49.125
Hurry, we're late.

20:50.103 --> 20:52.196
Jin-sung, can I
borrow your toe shoes?

22:51.824 --> 22:53.985
The bandages come off, and
she's flying across the floor.

22:54.494 --> 22:55.859
Was she faking it?

22:57.897 --> 22:59.592
Poor me...

23:04.737 --> 23:06.762
Not all of you can take
part in this competition.

23:07.173 --> 23:08.765
Only one student can go.

23:12.245 --> 23:13.542
It's not my choice,

23:14.647 --> 23:17.980
so we'll hold auditions
to choose one person fairly.

23:19.085 --> 23:22.248
If you're interested,
come to the office later.

23:23.923 --> 23:27.188
Hey, you'll never get
anywhere with that attitude.

23:28.027 --> 23:29.517
You need to try harder.

23:31.297 --> 23:34.892
It's a good opportunity,
so fight tooth and nail.

23:36.502 --> 23:37.332
Say something

23:39.805 --> 23:40.601
Good luck.

23:42.308 --> 23:44.003
That's all for now.

23:50.216 --> 23:51.683
An audition in name only.

23:52.852 --> 23:54.479
They gave Giselle to So-hee.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.620
Whoever dances
Giselle there wins.

23:56.722 --> 23:59.384
Jin-sung, you need
new toe shoes.

23:59.992 --> 24:01.220
They're all worn out.

24:06.599 --> 24:07.293
Teacher...

24:07.967 --> 24:08.934
See you later.

24:09.235 --> 24:09.701
Okay.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.471
I need to talk to you.

24:14.273 --> 24:15.706
- Now?
- Yes.

24:17.443 --> 24:20.469
You know Giselle
is a high level role?

24:21.647 --> 24:26.243
I know how you feel, but you
need more than just desire.

24:27.553 --> 24:31.683
You understand what I'm saying?
See you tomorrow.

24:57.483 --> 24:59.144
Hey you there

25:05.625 --> 25:06.523
Hey, Jinny

25:18.838 --> 25:20.271
What are you doing?

25:25.277 --> 25:30.374
Let's go buy toe shoes.
I'll treat you to dinner.

25:38.457 --> 25:40.857
Hey, you trying to look cool?

25:50.236 --> 25:50.895
One

25:54.874 --> 25:55.533
two

25:58.978 --> 25:59.467
three

26:02.581 --> 26:03.013
four

26:05.951 --> 26:06.383
five

26:09.889 --> 26:10.548
six

26:13.492 --> 26:14.254
seven

26:18.030 --> 26:18.519
eight

26:21.701 --> 26:22.360
nine

26:25.938 --> 26:26.461
ten

26:29.642 --> 26:30.472
eleven

26:36.082 --> 26:37.014
twelve

26:40.119 --> 26:40.915
thirteen

26:44.323 --> 26:45.290
fourteen

26:48.194 --> 26:49.456
fifteen

26:51.530 --> 26:53.327
sixteen

26:57.103 --> 26:58.263
twenty-three

27:02.007 --> 27:02.905
twenty-four

27:07.446 --> 27:09.437
twenty-five

27:11.417 --> 27:13.681
twenty-six

27:23.229 --> 27:26.062
twenty-seven

27:29.101 --> 27:32.832
twenty-eight

27:48.053 --> 27:55.482
Fox, fox, please
grant my wish.

27:58.330 --> 28:00.093
Let me go to the competition.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.424
Point your toe.

28:19.464 --> 28:21.830
Lower your shoulders.
Elbows... Good.

28:25.937 --> 28:26.926
And, one

28:29.508 --> 28:30.566
Straighten your back.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.415
Jin-sung, tighten
your stomach.

28:40.485 --> 28:42.817
Elance, fifth.

28:55.534 --> 28:56.466
Eyes.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.167
Are you coming?

29:01.606 --> 29:02.197
Go ahead.

29:02.407 --> 29:03.806
- Bye.
- See you.

29:38.443 --> 29:38.841
Hey

29:44.015 --> 29:45.983
Stop, Hae-ju

29:47.686 --> 29:48.482
Hae-ju

29:49.821 --> 29:50.788
Wait

30:18.690 --> 30:21.591
Good luck tomorrow.
Your toe shoes are too old

30:50.989 --> 30:51.614
Jin-sung.

32:20.578 --> 32:21.340
Over here

32:24.282 --> 32:25.180
Jin-sung

32:26.517 --> 32:27.609
YOON Jin-sung

32:41.866 --> 32:43.231
Leave me alone.

32:45.470 --> 32:47.028
Jin-sung, what's wrong?

32:48.106 --> 32:49.073
Let's talk.

32:50.108 --> 32:52.201
Stop bothering me

32:55.380 --> 32:56.369
It's because of
the competition?

33:08.126 --> 33:08.820
KIM So-hee.

33:12.063 --> 33:13.360
I really can't stand you.

33:17.101 --> 33:20.696
You make me miserable.

33:32.750 --> 33:35.514
If you leave like this,
we're through

33:43.094 --> 33:46.894
Jin-sung, all I need is you.

33:48.433 --> 33:49.923
I like you so much.

33:52.203 --> 33:52.601
Let go

34:51.529 --> 34:52.324
Very, very good.

34:56.000 --> 34:56.830
Um, teacher...

34:57.001 --> 34:58.434
What's the result?

35:00.438 --> 35:03.737
Yes, well...

35:03.975 --> 35:04.634
What?

35:08.513 --> 35:09.480
Grand prize

35:10.982 --> 35:12.415
I knew it. Congratulations

35:13.518 --> 35:14.951
You did so well.

35:45.783 --> 35:47.341
What'll we do, So-hee?

35:47.585 --> 35:49.553
What do you mean?

35:51.589 --> 35:52.749
What do you want me to do?

35:53.391 --> 35:55.382
I don't care if
I can't do ballet

36:07.672 --> 36:12.268
Mom, don't cry.

36:17.548 --> 36:18.515
Stop it.

36:20.051 --> 36:21.177
I'm sorry.

36:48.446 --> 36:49.310
So-hee.

37:51.241 --> 37:52.071
Jin-sung.

37:55.612 --> 37:56.476
YOON Jin-sung.

38:05.589 --> 38:09.184
You left your umbrella.
I worried about you.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.327
Sorry to have sent you
out in the rain that way.

38:19.803 --> 38:20.701
It was cold, huh?

38:22.906 --> 38:25.602
So-hee, how'd you get here?

38:27.478 --> 38:28.570
Is your leg okay?

38:31.815 --> 38:35.182
I waited 3 hours
at the hospital today.

38:36.987 --> 38:42.892
But then I thought you'd
refuse to see me again.

38:45.295 --> 38:47.092
And when you
and your mother...

38:47.197 --> 38:52.829
Jin-sung, congratulations.

39:04.148 --> 39:05.240
I'm okay.

39:06.216 --> 39:07.843
All I need is you.

39:12.456 --> 39:14.253
- Jinny.
- Sso.

39:58.402 --> 39:58.868
Jin-sung.

40:07.444 --> 40:08.103
Hi

41:06.436 --> 41:09.963
So-hee is dead.

41:25.555 --> 41:27.489
She pushed her
down the stairs.

41:28.392 --> 41:29.086
Oh my god

42:01.792 --> 42:02.349
Jin-sung.

42:03.860 --> 42:04.952
You're awake.

42:06.296 --> 42:07.024
Teacher.

42:09.533 --> 42:12.525
Yesterday So-hee
came to my room.

42:16.106 --> 42:19.303
We fell asleep together.

43:10.394 --> 43:12.089
Jin-sung, how are you?

43:12.863 --> 43:13.352
Are you okay?

43:17.734 --> 43:19.702
Do I have to change rooms?

43:22.139 --> 43:25.336
The teachers said it's
for your benefit. Okay?

43:26.343 --> 43:27.139
Hurry up.

43:32.682 --> 43:33.979
Hey, Eun-mi

43:34.651 --> 43:36.312
Is this your padded bra?

43:36.520 --> 43:37.452
Teacher

43:39.089 --> 43:39.851
Don't be so careless.

43:44.795 --> 43:45.557
Hurry up.

45:28.298 --> 45:28.787
What?

45:30.834 --> 45:31.960
Aren't these So-hee's?

45:32.102 --> 45:34.161
What's a dead girl's
stuff doing here?

45:37.407 --> 45:38.431
Hey, psycho's here.

45:52.789 --> 45:53.551
Is this yours?

45:55.592 --> 45:57.059
If it is, I'll give it to you.

46:03.833 --> 46:04.265
Give it

46:39.045 --> 46:41.104
I said to go to the snack bar.

46:41.281 --> 46:43.408
What is this?
We're not sheep.

46:57.964 --> 47:00.956
I've been so
hungry all this time.

47:06.372 --> 47:09.705
- Here, have some.
- Mine, too.

47:19.419 --> 47:21.887
Do you think I'm a pig?

47:24.324 --> 47:26.292
What a freak.

47:28.027 --> 47:29.961
What's gotten into her?

47:31.130 --> 47:34.065
They think we're rabbits?
Feeding us grass...

47:34.467 --> 47:36.935
- Let's go to the restroom.
- Why? The bell rang. Go yourself.

47:37.370 --> 47:41.704
Why are you
dragging me along?

47:42.975 --> 47:46.001
Slow down,
my stomach's full.

47:46.112 --> 47:46.840
Pot belly

47:50.249 --> 47:53.776
Hey, you've gained weight, huh?
Shouldn't you lose a few kilos?

47:54.387 --> 47:55.547
I gained weight?

47:56.055 --> 47:58.046
Nobody else said that.

47:58.624 --> 48:01.149
- I gained weight?
- Maybe not.

48:01.361 --> 48:05.695
You're just teasing
You cute little pot belly.

48:08.234 --> 48:12.898
If you diet, the first thing
to go are your breasts.

48:13.740 --> 48:16.937
If yours get any smaller,
the guys won't like it...

48:17.510 --> 48:22.209
With breasts, if guys feel
them they'll get bigger.

48:23.683 --> 48:24.809
How's Young-tae doing?

48:25.651 --> 48:28.085
Hey, I told you
not to mention him

48:28.354 --> 48:29.013
You're dead.

48:29.455 --> 48:32.720
You're the one who
started those rumors?

48:34.794 --> 48:36.421
Just you try
mentioning him again

48:59.518 --> 49:00.143
One

49:02.755 --> 49:03.346
two

49:05.891 --> 49:06.721
three

49:09.895 --> 49:10.623
four

49:14.300 --> 49:14.925
five

49:17.703 --> 49:18.567
six...

49:22.007 --> 49:23.702
twenty-eight

49:30.015 --> 49:34.076
twenty-nine

49:38.824 --> 49:43.124
Fox, fox, please grant my wish.

49:44.897 --> 49:47.092
Please send
So-hee back to me.

50:02.220 --> 50:03.016
YOON Jin-sung.

50:04.389 --> 50:05.014
YOON Jin-sung

50:06.058 --> 50:06.683
Wait

50:07.592 --> 50:08.957
Keep standing there.

50:14.333 --> 50:15.493
Sit, you little punk.

50:17.235 --> 50:18.065
Attention

50:26.545 --> 50:28.012
Our Jin-sung here...

50:28.914 --> 50:34.978
...has been invited to
a Russian ballet school.

50:36.054 --> 50:42.152
It's an honor for her and
the school. I'm very proud.

50:44.463 --> 50:47.591
What? No reaction?

50:48.233 --> 50:50.292
Let's all applaud her.

50:55.040 --> 50:58.100
Applause Don't be rude.
Applause

52:25.030 --> 52:26.019
Hi

53:18.884 --> 53:20.613
For Hae-ju's use only

53:50.916 --> 53:52.440
Do you feel lonely?

53:53.151 --> 53:55.585
Like you're the only
person in the world?

53:56.821 --> 54:01.281
At such times, try to show
friends or family your love.

54:02.594 --> 54:06.655
Those who feel lonely
don't allow love to start.

54:07.966 --> 54:12.335
An honest love will receive
back twice what is given.

54:13.371 --> 54:17.171
If you gave your heart in vain,
how bleak a world it would be.

54:18.710 --> 54:22.646
If you loved and were ignored,
wouldn't it be better to die?

54:23.348 --> 54:24.440
Why bother living?

55:18.603 --> 55:21.401
Your hair would
be prettier black.

56:00.145 --> 56:02.238
I've always wanted
to get close to you.

56:03.748 --> 56:04.612
Really.

56:06.284 --> 56:07.876
I like you so much.

56:24.402 --> 56:26.233
That's not it, Young-sun.

56:28.006 --> 56:31.066
Lift your leg higher and
pull back your shoulders.

56:31.710 --> 56:33.439
Make a line with your leg.

56:33.745 --> 56:34.507
Try it again.

56:37.782 --> 56:38.976
Together with the music.

56:58.203 --> 56:58.897
Let's stop.

57:00.605 --> 57:02.937
But we only did it twice.

57:03.608 --> 57:05.269
Just say we did it all.

57:07.011 --> 57:08.740
The audio's broken anyway...

57:10.248 --> 57:13.911
Back during the audition,

57:14.652 --> 57:16.483
you changed
toe-shoes with So-hee.

57:17.756 --> 57:19.121
Why was that?

57:20.492 --> 57:21.584
Why do you care?

57:30.034 --> 57:31.194
Oh, what is this?

57:40.712 --> 57:42.236
Hey, turn on the light.

57:42.881 --> 57:44.143
It wasn't me.

57:44.849 --> 57:45.747
Wait a sec.

58:40.004 --> 58:41.835
Stop it, calm down

58:42.073 --> 58:43.438
It was rusty water.

58:46.077 --> 58:47.567
Why are you freaking out?

58:48.112 --> 58:51.639
If they repair pipes,
they should let us know.

59:04.596 --> 59:07.997
It's just the wind.
Back to your rooms

59:10.001 --> 59:11.662
- But I saw a ghost.
- Here's no such thing

59:13.671 --> 59:15.764
Hey, quiet

59:21.312 --> 59:23.439
I really hate the dark.

59:36.427 --> 59:40.557
Don't you hear something?
I hear it.

59:43.368 --> 59:44.801
I really do.

59:49.874 --> 59:52.775
But would black hair suit me?

59:54.779 --> 59:56.246
Me with black hair?

59:58.016 --> 01:00:01.713
A stylist? I know
you have that talent.

01:00:04.489 --> 01:00:06.252
Really? Thank you.

01:00:08.493 --> 01:00:10.893
Stop it. It tickles

01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:15.056
All right, I'll do what you say.

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:33.001
Who is it?

01:01:36.481 --> 01:01:37.277
Who is it?

01:01:38.483 --> 01:01:40.110
It's Hae-ju.

01:02:00.071 --> 01:02:04.667
I keep hearing noises.
I can't sleep.

01:02:09.147 --> 01:02:11.342
Like someone's
tapping at my window.

01:02:14.719 --> 01:02:17.119
Let me sleep here,
just for tonight.

01:02:20.058 --> 01:02:23.824
What noise? It's the wind.

01:02:24.429 --> 01:02:25.623
I'm scared.

01:02:27.165 --> 01:02:28.564
What's there to be scared of?

01:02:30.535 --> 01:02:34.369
We'll get yelled at if
you stay. Go back.

01:02:41.079 --> 01:02:41.773
I'm sorry.

01:02:53.624 --> 01:02:55.489
- Should we wish too?
- Should we?

01:02:55.827 --> 01:02:59.263
- I want bigger breasts. You?
- I want a boyfriend.

01:02:59.597 --> 01:03:03.294
- With that face of yours?
- Your breasts are even worse.

01:03:03.534 --> 01:03:06.435
- What the hell? My breasts?
- That's right.

01:03:06.604 --> 01:03:10.131
Hey, you all go ahead.
I forgot something.

01:03:10.908 --> 01:03:12.773
- Okay, see you.
- Bye

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.947
Fox, fox, please grant my wish.

01:03:23.387 --> 01:03:27.619
Once again, this self-portrait
serves as your final exam.

01:03:29.026 --> 01:03:32.757
And if you go make something
weird, you'll get a zero.

01:03:33.764 --> 01:03:34.423
Got it?

01:03:34.532 --> 01:03:35.556
Yes.

01:03:36.067 --> 01:03:36.761
Yoon-ji

01:03:38.436 --> 01:03:38.731
Yes?

01:03:39.504 --> 01:03:41.768
You bored working
with younger kids?

01:03:43.074 --> 01:03:46.009
I'll be going down to check
your work. Understand?

01:03:46.777 --> 01:03:47.573
Got it.

01:03:48.412 --> 01:03:49.106
You punk.

01:03:50.114 --> 01:03:51.513
I said I got it.

01:03:51.983 --> 01:03:53.041
Hey, HAN Yoon-ji!

01:04:08.399 --> 01:04:12.165
Now let's have an interview
with the best artist.

01:04:14.138 --> 01:04:16.606
Yoon-ji, when did
you start taking art?

01:04:17.942 --> 01:04:19.204
Elementary school, 2nd grade.

01:04:19.911 --> 01:04:23.210
Ah, so from then you
exhibited a rare talent?

01:04:24.215 --> 01:04:25.341
Indeed so.

01:04:28.886 --> 01:04:32.822
Congratulations on winning
the art competition.

01:05:45.096 --> 01:05:49.123
What? I told you to
stay out of my way.

01:05:54.238 --> 01:05:57.366
You smell like rot. Get out!

01:05:58.909 --> 01:06:00.774
This isn't your chair!

01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:06.313
You're insane!

01:06:14.692 --> 01:06:16.182
Why do you torment Hae-ju?

01:06:17.928 --> 01:06:19.589
Don't you feel pity for her?

01:06:24.635 --> 01:06:26.102
I know your wish.

01:06:28.205 --> 01:06:30.537
Today I'll make
your wish come true.

01:07:28.299 --> 01:07:30.767
What a little brat.

01:07:32.737 --> 01:07:34.534
What the hell
does she do here?

01:08:07.204 --> 01:08:10.173
HAN Yoon-ji, you're the best

01:08:31.328 --> 01:08:33.421
That was too far.

01:08:34.365 --> 01:08:36.662
You didn't need
to do that, So-hee.

01:08:38.068 --> 01:08:41.526
Okay, I'll do what you say.

01:08:41.671 --> 01:08:46.268
Don't abandon me.

01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:55.381
I won't abandon you.

01:08:57.898 --> 01:09:02.267
I sent the letter from Russia
to the dorm. Check it later.

01:09:21.688 --> 01:09:22.346
What is it, Jin-sung?

01:09:23.724 --> 01:09:24.520
The letter...

01:09:24.691 --> 01:09:26.818
- I put it in your room.
- Okay.

01:10:19.923 --> 01:10:20.821
Teacher...

01:10:35.071 --> 01:10:36.971
Congratulations, Jin-sung!

01:10:37.641 --> 01:10:44.376
Congratulations on
your admission!

01:10:48.752 --> 01:10:51.346
Surprised? We
planned it for you.

01:10:51.588 --> 01:10:52.486
We're friends, after all.

01:10:58.862 --> 01:11:01.422
Thank you. Really.

01:11:08.038 --> 01:11:08.629
Congratulations.

01:11:09.973 --> 01:11:13.033
Jin-sung, have a nice trip.

01:11:18.515 --> 01:11:19.539
- Let's go.
- See ya.

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:37.298
Come to the sculpture
room at 7:00, So-hee

01:14:36.658 --> 01:14:37.124
Hey!

01:14:40.062 --> 01:14:42.963
Jin-sung, did I scare you?

01:14:57.079 --> 01:15:01.209
You know how sad
I am that you're leaving?

01:15:08.724 --> 01:15:13.787
How will I get by without you?

01:15:22.805 --> 01:15:26.832
Jin-sung, I prepared
something for today.

01:15:27.976 --> 01:15:28.670
One minute.

01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.684
Ta-dah!

01:15:50.098 --> 01:15:51.588
Why are you doing this to me?

01:15:52.034 --> 01:15:55.231
That's obvious. We're friends.

01:15:55.838 --> 01:15:58.671
How can you make
me feel so sad?

01:15:59.575 --> 01:16:01.270
Jinny...

01:16:04.613 --> 01:16:06.308
Pretty me will have to bear it.

01:16:09.084 --> 01:16:10.142
There's no corkscrew!

01:16:16.758 --> 01:16:20.524
Jin-sung, I'll go get one now.

01:16:21.897 --> 01:16:23.694
Wait a sec, okay?

01:17:06.975 --> 01:17:11.639
Jin-sung, So-hee
keeps coming to me.

01:17:13.782 --> 01:17:20.745
Help me, please.

01:17:22.057 --> 01:17:29.623
Help me, help me.

01:17:45.847 --> 01:17:47.178
All I need is you.

01:17:49.151 --> 01:17:49.810
Don't go.

01:19:07.462 --> 01:19:09.089
Please.

01:19:22.144 --> 01:19:23.304
Jin-sung

01:19:28.884 --> 01:19:30.613
I know you're here.

01:20:44.693 --> 01:20:50.359
Hey, Jinny.
Why are you hiding?

01:20:51.933 --> 01:20:56.461
Because of that? I'm fine.

01:21:00.408 --> 01:21:03.172
Even though you pushed
me down the stairs...

01:21:05.981 --> 01:21:07.471
I'm right here.

01:21:11.052 --> 01:21:12.986
All I need is you.

01:21:26.134 --> 01:21:26.998
Found you!

01:21:36.611 --> 01:21:37.373
Hae-ju.

01:21:38.413 --> 01:21:39.778
There's something
you don't know.

01:21:41.449 --> 01:21:43.349
I didn't push her
down the stairs.

01:21:45.954 --> 01:21:47.649
If you were So-hee,
you'd know.

01:21:49.624 --> 01:21:52.092
You're crazy, Hae-ju!

01:21:53.862 --> 01:21:54.794
Jin-sung.

01:21:56.498 --> 01:21:59.490
How could you mistake
me for that dirty pig?

01:22:17.285 --> 01:22:20.846
Hae-ju, out of the way.

01:22:28.029 --> 01:22:28.859
Jin-sung.

01:22:30.298 --> 01:22:32.858
Hae-ju, you're crazy!

01:22:33.835 --> 01:22:34.824
You're crazy.

01:22:40.308 --> 01:22:42.173
Hae-ju, out of the way.

01:22:49.551 --> 01:22:51.178
Hae-ju, please.

01:22:52.654 --> 01:22:54.952
Please Hae-ju, please.

01:22:59.928 --> 01:23:03.591
Jin-sung. Don't you
know who I am?

01:23:05.433 --> 01:23:06.559
I'm So-hee.

01:23:24.619 --> 01:23:26.086
Don't go, Jin-sung.

01:23:28.089 --> 01:23:28.817
Please don't go.

01:23:32.594 --> 01:23:35.791
If you leave like this,
we're through!

01:23:43.471 --> 01:23:45.462
I like you so much.

01:24:20.275 --> 01:24:21.867
I'm so tired.

01:24:31.619 --> 01:24:33.416
I won't leave you.

01:24:35.056 --> 01:24:36.318
We're friends.

01:25:02.884 --> 01:25:08.117
I guess Jin-sung
doesn't like you.

01:28:01.228 --> 01:28:09.693
Jin-sung, you can do it.
It'll all be fine.

01:32:54.855 --> 01:32:57.085
Make it go back.

01:32:57.491 --> 01:32:58.116
Seventeen

01:32:58.325 --> 01:32:58.984
eighteen

01:33:10.804 --> 01:33:16.037
Make it all turn back.
Make it turn back!

01:33:49.509 --> 01:33:50.635
Jin-sung, don't go.

01:33:54.781 --> 01:33:56.078
Why do you avoid me?

01:33:59.119 --> 01:34:01.349
I've been waiting
here for you.

01:34:05.292 --> 01:34:06.224
Jin-sung.

01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:13.791
You're all I have, Jin-sung.

01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:21.234
I guess we can never go back?

01:34:24.311 --> 01:34:30.807
I'm scared to leave you
here and go alone.

01:34:32.319 --> 01:34:33.047
I'm sorry.

01:34:35.655 --> 01:34:37.179
I didn't hate you.

01:34:40.026 --> 01:34:45.692
I just... wanted to win once.

01:34:47.634 --> 01:34:48.464
It's okay.

01:34:50.504 --> 01:34:51.630
We're friends.

01:34:55.776 --> 01:34:57.368
You'll forgive me?

01:34:58.645 --> 01:35:05.073
How could I ever hate you?

01:35:09.523 --> 01:35:10.353
Jin-sung.

01:35:11.892 --> 01:35:16.090
You don't seem to like me
as much as I like you.

01:35:17.697 --> 01:35:22.691
Don't make me wait for you
so long.

01:35:24.571 --> 01:35:29.008
I want to be with you forever.

01:36:13.639 --> 01:36:14.469
One

01:36:16.142 --> 01:36:16.904
two

01:36:19.012 --> 01:36:19.808
three

01:36:21.481 --> 01:36:22.243
four

01:36:22.715 --> 01:36:23.443
twenty-one

01:36:24.283 --> 01:36:25.375
twenty-two

01:36:26.219 --> 01:36:27.311
twenty-three

01:36:28.354 --> 01:36:29.184
twenty-four

01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:31.479
twenty-five

01:36:32.592 --> 01:36:33.581
twenty-seven

01:36:34.827 --> 01:36:35.156
Huh?

01:36:35.795 --> 01:36:37.422
Twenty-five!

01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:38.728
Twenty-seven?

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:41.926
Twenty-six

01:36:42.168 --> 01:36:42.759
twenty-seven

01:36:42.902 --> 01:36:43.425
wenty-eight

01:36:43.936 --> 01:36:44.994
That was nothing.

01:36:45.705 --> 01:36:49.163
Lights out at ten, don't dare
visit other rooms after that.

01:36:49.675 --> 01:36:50.141
Got it?

01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:58.879
Laundry's in the basement.
You got a question, ask me.

01:37:05.792 --> 01:37:10.229
This room's been empty, so open
the window. And let some air in.

01:37:37.757 --> 01:37:38.849
What's this tune?

01:37:40.393 --> 01:37:41.417
Do I know this song?

01:37:42.305 --> 01:37:48.931
