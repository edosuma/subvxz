We need to work together
because I'm the guy holding
your golden ticket.

00:08.593 --> 00:10.299
You made your choice.
You chose you.

00:10.595 --> 00:11.584
I'm reprogramming it.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.668
Will it work?

00:12.763 --> 00:14.378
That's the question
I'm afraid to ask myself.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.464
Somewhere
in time, the Traveler
changed something.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.970

to exist. A moment is coming.

I think he's here
for the key.

but I've got a deadline.

00:25.443 --> 00:26.432

00:26.611 --> 00:28.647

haven't made a move.

They can't.

When's your team going in?
Well, we're gearing up now.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.968
I know I can't stop you.
I don't want to.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.178
But I need to ask
one last favor.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.143
Please. Give me
a head start before
you launch your assault.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.798
Ah. Don't worry about it.

01:30.675 --> 01:32.666
Okay. I won't.

01:35.346 --> 01:36.335

at this point.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.271
Those officers, Travis,

01:45.231 --> 01:48.223
they died trying to
prevent what Kellog's
army is about to do.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.439
The least we can do
is finish the job.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.276
You know, even if I figured
out a way to send you
forward in time,

01:59.370 --> 02:02.862
I'm still not entirely
sure which future I'll
be sending you to.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.874
Odds are it'll be
linked to Kellog's
dark future, which,

02:07.420 --> 02:10.753
if we don't stop him now,
it could be a very nasty
place in sixty years.

02:11.257 --> 02:14.249
But if there's even the
slightest chance that
I can be with Sam again,

02:16.387 --> 02:17.968
I'm willing to risk
everything.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.214

Once we send the pulse signal
to our future and tether,
we will be locked.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.765
When that happens,
you only have 90 minutes
to get everyone through

03:07.897 --> 03:10.309

degrades completely.
Is that gonna be enough?

03:10.483 --> 03:11.939

came to this timeline,

06:28.973 --> 06:31.339
I thought that having it all
was within my grasp.

we're all done here.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.929
All right.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.356
I suppose it doesn't make
a difference now.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.648
Yeah, Marcellus knew.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.230
It was his idea to convince
you otherwise.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.941
He knew the first minute we
arrived, you went soft.

17:16.328 --> 17:17.784
l betrayed people

17:17.996 --> 17:19.952
thinking this was the
only way to save families!

17:20.040 --> 17:21.621
Nothing's changed, Tonkin.

17:22.584 --> 17:23.869
We're still saving families.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.367
Ours.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.841
Kiera?
Yeah?

17:38.642 --> 17:39.882
You saved me.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.224
What are you
talking about?

17:43.563 --> 17:46.350
We all go through life
thinking we know how
it's gonna turn out.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.935
We imagine ourfuture,

17:49.027 --> 17:51.609
we make moves
and decisions that
lead us in that direction.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.441
But you changed
that for me.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.194
You gave me knowledge
of what would be.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.079
The life that l was
supposed to have,

18:00.163 --> 18:01.994
the future that I built
that you came from.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.874
A profound regret
is what you spared me.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.374
I don't think I'll ever be
able to thank you enough.

18:11.007 --> 18:11.996
Alec.

18:12.509 --> 18:17.799
The simple fact that you want
to change is all the thanks
I will ever need.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.839
I won't let you down.

18:22.978 --> 18:23.967
I know.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.310
We don't have much time.
Go.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.441
Zorin says they're close
to opening the portal.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.397
And you should
know they brought
through reinforcements.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.902
How many?
Three.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.610
Carlos and the VPD will be
hitting this place any minute.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.570
Your security team
needs to do its thing

18:43.665 --> 18:46.031
and draw the soldiers
into a two-front fight.
Zack.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.995
l'll prepare them.
I'm a man of my word.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.166
Not really.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.162
Alec, what do you need?
Access to the machine.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.748
I'll need at least 30 seconds
at the panel, assuming
it's straightforward.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.723
You know I've always been
an admirer of yours.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.306
Women like you
are rare in any time.

19:04.436 --> 19:05.721
Past, present or future.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.220
Whatever happens in there,

19:09.441 --> 19:11.477
I'll always know I met my
match in Kiera Cameron.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.768
Wow. Thank you.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.647
Don't... Don't you have
anything nice you wanna
say about me?

19:20.702 --> 19:21.691
Not really.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.324
I'm going to go
to the portal room,
do some recon.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.404
You stay here.
I'll be back.

19:31.921 --> 19:32.910
(DOOR CLOSES)

19:36.801 --> 19:38.052
CARLOS: Let's get somebody
on the north and south,

19:38.136 --> 19:39.751
we'll need eyes on this
entrance as well.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.673
Get eyes over here, let me
know if you see any movement.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.267
We arrested him trying to get
through our perimeter.
Says he knows you?

19:48.355 --> 19:50.812
Yeah, it's all good,
cut him loose. What are
you doing here?

19:50.899 --> 19:52.855
Warning you.
I wanted to warn you.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.143
Kiera, Alec...
Those two of ours are inside.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.269
l'll brief the squad.
But there's something else.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.782
The machine in there
is essentially an anti-matter
fusion bomb.

20:03.078 --> 20:07.538
Once those guns start
firing, you could set off
a chain reaction explosion.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.368
What kind of damage
are we talking about?

20:09.459 --> 20:11.245
Worst-case scenario...

20:12.587 --> 20:13.793
Half the city.

20:17.926 --> 20:18.915
ALEC: lronic.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.382
What's that?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.293
This is near where you killed
Lucas in cold blood.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.630
That was different.
KIERA: I don't see how.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.970
You made your choice,
now you live with it.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.346
Things aren't always
black and white, Kiera.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.814
You of all people
should know that.
Oh, that's right.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.727
You're either fighting for an
idea that's bigger than you,

20:34.901 --> 20:36.186
or you're fighting
for yourself.

20:37.153 --> 20:40.236
Which is it?
I'm not sure.

20:41.658 --> 20:44.900
lam. You're conflicted, Brad.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.069
You want clarity,

20:47.539 --> 20:49.655
and clarity is a luxury
in this business.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.367
Time travel screws with
our notions about what's
supposed to happen.

20:54.129 --> 20:56.165
It gives us a false
sense of control,

20:56.673 --> 21:00.006
but really, we're all
just pawns.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.759
And all this?

21:05.265 --> 21:07.506
This is to keep
the darkness at bay.

21:08.059 --> 21:11.142
And you of all people
should understand that.

21:21.156 --> 21:22.521
Marcellus lied to me.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.235
He told me we were
building a portal to rescue
our brothers and sisters

21:29.330 --> 21:30.866
from an oncoming massacre,

21:32.667 --> 21:34.328
but it's a full-scale
invasion.

21:35.086 --> 21:39.079
They want to bring the war
to this time and win it
before it even starts.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.375
Audacious.

21:40.717 --> 21:44.756
This whole thing is insane.
So what do you want
to do about it?

21:50.560 --> 21:52.096
I want to prevent
more suffering.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.805
Brad's right.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.063
Mission priority:

22:03.573 --> 22:05.279
destroy the machine
and the portal.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.233
What? What about you?

22:08.536 --> 22:11.744
If it's my time, we'll find
out one way or another.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.079
But either way,

22:19.589 --> 22:20.578
change of plans.

22:27.931 --> 22:28.920
(PHONE RINGING)

22:29.766 --> 22:31.757

What are we looking at?

22:32.268 --> 22:33.929
Piron security's
gonnaletusin.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.894
The northwest door.
My guys will go through
their machine room

22:36.981 --> 22:38.096
and hit them from
the other side.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.606
Copy, northwest door.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.856
Hey, Kiera,
do we trust Kellog?

22:47.784 --> 22:51.572
I'm not sure.
Good luck, Carlos.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.280
Well, that's my cue.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.500
I like to leave before
the shooting starts,
as you know.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.546
Goodbye, Kiera.

23:04.092 --> 23:09.382
It's been...
Well... Never mind.

23:20.817 --> 23:25.561
Sir, I'm here to
offer my services,
limited as they are.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.408
Bradley, let me see
your firearm please.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.705
We can use every cop
we can get.

23:34.789 --> 23:35.778
(COCKS GUN)

23:37.625 --> 23:39.161
Gentlemen.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.004
(GRUNTS)

24:00.064 --> 24:02.020
So how long have
you known about Kiera?

24:03.735 --> 24:04.895
Long enough.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.185
Probably should have
told you sooner.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.525
We only would have
screwed lt up.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.981
(SIGHS) lwasn't
ready to listen.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.237
Where the hell
have you been?

24:57.288 --> 24:58.573
Vasquez is dead.

25:00.958 --> 25:01.947
What?

25:04.962 --> 25:05.951
And Kellog?

25:06.047 --> 25:07.753
I don't know. He's
not where he should be.

25:08.883 --> 25:12.250
If something happens to him,
this was all for nothing.
Yeah, I know.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.134
Grimes, get your
people ready.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.926
Somebody find Kellog.
I'm on it.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.745
We can't open the portal
without all of them.
I know.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.077
We need to buy
ourselves some time.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.452
You know what to do.

25:48.673 --> 25:49.788
What are they up to?

25:50.591 --> 25:52.968
I don't know,
but I don't like
the looks of it.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.337
Okay, there's Carlos.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.344
Okay, remember, do not
hit the machine.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.814
Where are your men?
There.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.194
All right.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.492
Here we go.

26:36.679 --> 26:37.919

26:39.974 --> 26:40.963
Oh, shit.

26:41.684 --> 26:45.677

down and lay face down
with your hands on the floor!

27:21.641 --> 27:23.256
Whose orders?
Mr. Kellog's orders.

in the others.

27:54.465 --> 27:55.796
It's not on the
blueprints that l have.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.841
There's a utility corridor
that runs underneath
the south wall.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.485
What do you think you're
doing, Cameron?

28:22.952 --> 28:26.194
I think you don't want
anything to happen
to your supreme leader

that might ripple
into the future.

28:37.592 --> 28:38.832
Get out of my way, Curtis.

a stop to this.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.797
You've never wavered,
Jasmine.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.550
Never stopped
fighting for the cause.

28:44.974 --> 28:48.307
You're so focused
you haven't noticed that
you're already victorious.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.013
That might be so,

28:50.771 --> 28:53.763
but I'm not going to let you
or anyone else risk the lives

28:53.858 --> 28:57.271
of everyone in this timeline
so that Kellog can screw
us all over.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.151
Kellog has his own path
that he must take.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.819
Neither you nor I
can change that.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.526
I don't remember being your
hostage as part of our deal.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.402
And I don't recall you
mentioning your plan to
time travel using the portal.

29:07.663 --> 29:08.698
What?

29:10.416 --> 29:12.998
Why would he do that?
Because he knows
he's screwed.

29:13.461 --> 29:16.203
In this time, and in the one
that you come from.

29:16.881 --> 29:18.291
He's got nowhere
to go but backwards.

29:18.424 --> 29:22.212
You have been playing both
sides since the beginning.
That's right.

29:22.303 --> 29:23.543
So why should
I trust you?

29:23.638 --> 29:26.630
Because I think you want
what's best for the protector
as much as I do.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.223
She left 2077
against her own will

29:29.310 --> 29:32.347
and she's done more to change
the future than Liber8
could have ever done.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.601
At the end of the day,
she is our best weapon.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.349
Backwards? What are
you talking about?

29:38.736 --> 29:43.070
You wait under that bridge for
all of us to arrive from 2077

29:43.199 --> 29:44.609
and then you kill everyone.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.031
You're insane.
No.

down to business.

30:07.848 --> 30:08.883
Now.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.059
I'll kill him, right now.

30:11.394 --> 30:14.261
Will you? 'Cause I don't
think you will.

30:15.231 --> 30:19.065
I think you need that portal
open just as much as I do.

30:20.236 --> 30:23.728
I think you could have raided
this place days ago,

30:23.948 --> 30:27.657
but you didn't.
You needed us to fix
that machine.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.869
You sabotaged
that key to stall us.
Why?

30:34.500 --> 30:38.743

Weaver, take the kid.

32:32.076 --> 32:34.408
This invasion starts now.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.538
(GRUNTING)

32:38.916 --> 32:39.905
(GUN SHOT)

32:40.334 --> 32:41.414
Carlos!

32:46.549 --> 32:48.005
Gun! Gun!

32:49.009 --> 32:49.998
Kill everyone!

32:54.557 --> 32:56.047
(GUNFIRE)

33:02.690 --> 33:03.679

(PORTAL POWERS UP)

33:43.772 --> 33:45.603

(GROANS)

34:14.929 --> 34:16.385
(GUNSHOTS)
(GRUNTS)

34:20.601 --> 34:21.932
Dillon!

34:24.897 --> 34:26.307
I choose me!

34:26.398 --> 34:27.558
KeHog,no!

34:36.659 --> 34:37.648
(GRUNTS)

34:39.328 --> 34:40.317
No!

34:56.011 --> 34:58.047
Kiera, the portal is
collapsing.

34:58.472 --> 35:00.212
Kellog destroyed that future
when he went through.

35:00.307 --> 35:02.468
You're gonna be okay,
we're gonna get you
out of here, Jack.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.890
It's now or never.

35:04.853 --> 35:05.842
Listen to the kid.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.054
Kiera?

35:08.232 --> 35:09.221
Kiera, please.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.431
No.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.865
ALEC: Kiera, please.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.004
You don't have
to say anything.

35:31.547 --> 35:32.627
I know.

35:34.675 --> 35:36.165
l'll build you
a better future.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.167
I'll do it for you,
Kiera Cameron.

35:39.722 --> 35:40.711
Thank you.

35:52.693 --> 35:53.682
Thank you.

36:09.668 --> 36:10.874
We gotta clear
out of here.

36:10.961 --> 36:12.576
Everyone, fall back!

36:12.921 --> 36:13.910
Fall back!

36:26.435 --> 36:28.596
CARLOS: It's a shame to lose
Dillon and all those officers.

36:29.271 --> 36:30.431
For what?

36:31.774 --> 36:32.889
ls Kiera dead?

36:35.444 --> 36:36.433
Alec?

36:38.655 --> 36:39.815
She might not be.

36:41.658 --> 36:43.489
The machine was
tethered to my future.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.781
The future that was
destroyed the moment
Kellog went through,

36:46.997 --> 36:49.409
allowing the traveler to
return to his own time.

36:50.209 --> 36:51.494
What the hell
happened to Kiera?

36:53.462 --> 36:54.577
There's no way to know.

36:56.799 --> 36:58.835
It might be another 60 years
before we figure it out.

37:01.303 --> 37:04.010
Look, what we do
with this is up to us.

37:04.431 --> 37:05.466
All of us.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.465
We have a chance to build
something better.

37:08.977 --> 37:09.966
ForheL

37:10.187 --> 37:11.677
No, except we're screwed.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.933
Kellog stepped through.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.402
Kiera had the notion
that Kellog would try
something like this.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.603
We used Piron's equipment to
program Kiera's time ball.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.197
By allowing us to have
access to his system,

37:24.284 --> 37:27.151
Kellog thought he could learn
how to program his time ball,

37:27.579 --> 37:30.286
but instead itjust
allowed us to feed him
the wrong information

37:30.374 --> 37:33.992
regarding how to select dates,
which apparently he assumed
was genuine.

37:35.254 --> 37:38.246
He might have thought he was
going back to the day that
Kiera and Liber8 arrived.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.087
But he didn't.

37:40.717 --> 37:41.706
No.

37:42.678 --> 37:45.920
So where...
When did he go?

37:51.103 --> 37:52.092
(SIGHS)

37:53.689 --> 37:55.304
(INSECTS BUZZING)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

38:04.408 --> 38:05.864
(SOFTLY) Oh, my God.

38:16.170 --> 38:17.501
Oh, that little shit.

38:34.730 --> 38:35.765
No.

38:37.232 --> 38:38.733
(GRUNTS) No.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.307
No.

38:42.821 --> 38:43.901
What does this mean?

38:44.740 --> 38:46.605
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.367
Liber8 won.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.490
What's Liber8?

38:53.874 --> 38:54.863
No, wait.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.832
I remember
the stories now.

38:59.755 --> 39:01.837
Uncle Julian used
to tell me

39:02.090 --> 39:05.253
about his younger
days protesting the
old corporations.

39:06.303 --> 39:09.466
A barbaric and uncivilized age
by all accounts.

39:11.141 --> 39:12.722
But you would know that,
wouldn't you?

39:15.145 --> 39:16.760
You would have
known him then.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.265
Kiera?

39:24.029 --> 39:25.144
OLDER ALEC: I missed it!

39:27.366 --> 39:28.526
I didn't want to miss it!

39:28.700 --> 39:33.615
I warned you, Alec.
I warned you, but as usual
you don't listen.

39:37.668 --> 39:38.748
It worked.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.834
I've been waiting
for you, Kiera.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.623
For 60 years I didn't know
ifyou died that day
in the portal.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.758
That, that's right, it's me.

39:50.055 --> 39:54.799
The same one you left
just a second ago,
from your perspective.

39:55.602 --> 39:56.591
Alec?

39:58.021 --> 39:59.636
Oh, Alec!

40:01.149 --> 40:02.434
(BOTH SOBBlNG)

40:02.818 --> 40:04.809
I know, you were
just with me!

40:09.783 --> 40:11.193
This is so strange.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.321
Imagine what it's
like for me.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.040
You did it.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.741
You did it.

40:24.464 --> 40:25.453
Sam?

40:27.509 --> 40:28.498
Is he here?

40:30.887 --> 40:32.013
I'll take you to him.

40:32.889 --> 40:33.878
(SOBS)

40:38.437 --> 40:41.019
Emily lobbied City Hall for
that before she passed.

40:41.690 --> 40:44.227
You were together?
Every day until the end.

40:46.028 --> 40:47.017
PoHce?

40:48.697 --> 40:49.982
Not CPS?

40:50.866 --> 40:52.231
CPS never formed.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.152
There was no collapse,
no uprising, no revolution.

40:57.289 --> 41:00.201
No corporate congress.
And no corporate congress.

41:02.502 --> 41:05.994
Julian and Edouard
and I saw to that.
Amazing.

41:07.549 --> 41:08.959
It's because
of you, Kiera.

41:11.386 --> 41:12.375
And Sam?

41:13.305 --> 41:14.886
Sam's over there. See?

41:16.224 --> 41:17.213
Sam.

41:18.894 --> 41:22.011
OLDER ALEC: I set the time
coordinates as close as
I could to the year you left.

41:23.190 --> 41:25.055
I knew you'd have some
adjustments to make.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.401
You're not angry?

41:31.323 --> 41:32.654
No, how could I be?

41:34.326 --> 41:36.066
You've given me
the greatest gift.

41:37.579 --> 41:38.739
l have to see him.

41:42.376 --> 41:44.037
You made
a better world, Kiera.

41:44.878 --> 41:45.867
What?

41:46.338 --> 41:47.703
VVethoughtyou
died that day.

41:48.799 --> 41:52.542
Carlos, Julian and l
dedicated ourselves to
building a better future.

41:54.513 --> 41:57.676
And we steered civilization,
inspired by your sacrifice.

41:59.309 --> 42:00.298
KIERA: But Sam?

42:02.354 --> 42:05.061
OLDER ALEC: This is the price
for making the world
a better place.

42:06.942 --> 42:10.981
This Sam will grow up in a
world free of violence,

42:12.072 --> 42:14.279
free of revolution,
free of corruption.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.274
His future is bright.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.027
And it's because
of you, Kiera.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.126
That's the price of love.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.666
(SOBBING)

42:26.753 --> 42:28.084
Real love.

42:30.632 --> 42:34.170
You'll understand. In time.
