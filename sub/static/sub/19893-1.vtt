WEBVTT

02:27.971 --> 02:29.757
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.442
Oh, Jesus! Jesus!
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

02:33.862 --> 02:34.195
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:34.844 --> 02:39.042
Keep your head down. Look at me.
You're going to be okay.

02:39.148 --> 02:40.752
Where's he from?

02:42.618 --> 02:44.154
13th skirt.

02:44.220 --> 02:47.235
I thought the Black Watch were up
around Hill 60 or somewhere.

02:47.290 --> 02:50.930
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Must've lost his head.

02:51.593 --> 02:53.584
Must've lost his head...

03:00.736 --> 03:03.375
- They in there, Sarge?
- Yeah, they would seem to be.

03:03.438 --> 03:05.383
Who the hell would put a gun nest
in a church?

03:05.440 --> 03:08.523
Up round "Wipers" they put one in a bar.
Think about that.

03:08.577 --> 03:10.215
Alright, listen up.

03:10.278 --> 03:12.621
Highway, you and Skinner,
you work your way up that side.

03:12.681 --> 03:14.421
Peters, you come with me.

03:14.483 --> 03:16.474
We cover. We lead.

03:16.918 --> 03:18.909
Everybody ready?

03:21.074 --> 03:22.075
Okay...

03:25.227 --> 03:27.218
Let's go.

03:43.244 --> 03:45.735
Skinner! Drag him out of there!

03:46.714 --> 03:49.751
Goddamnit!
Stay here. Keep your head down.

03:49.770 --> 03:52.439
No, please don't. No...

03:59.363 --> 04:01.240
You're gonna be alright, Highway.

04:01.629 --> 04:04.326
You're gonna be fine.
Skinner, give me your dressing.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.824
Stay down! Get your head down!

04:09.537 --> 04:12.756
- This is kind of funny, eh?
- For God's sake, Skinner!

04:27.922 --> 04:31.197
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

04:49.209 --> 04:52.372
Leave your rifle.
Get in behind me.

04:56.850 --> 04:58.795
- I'm going home.
- What are you doing?

04:58.852 --> 05:00.592
- Halt!
- Get your hands up!

05:00.653 --> 05:04.350
Wait! He isn't doing anything.
He's just clearing his pack.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.430
No, no! Wait!

05:06.559 --> 05:08.845
Wait! Kamerad! Kamerad!

05:08.962 --> 05:10.736
- I'm going home!
- No!

06:11.022 --> 06:12.717
Kamerad?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.524
<i>Let's go, double line!</i>

06:40.566 --> 06:42.484
<i>Bombers over here, gunners on the flanks!</i>

06:46.657 --> 06:48.852
<i>Hey, we got a live one here!</i>

06:51.395 --> 06:53.385
<i>- Where's Highway?
- He went that way.</i>

07:18.922 --> 07:23.120
It's alright now.
You're alright now, Sergeant.

07:23.927 --> 07:28.261
You're back home.
You're safe.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.235
You know, they have
these birds of prey over there.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.133
They call them kestrels,

07:45.347 --> 07:50.068
and every time I look at you it's like
I've got one banging around right in here.

07:51.987 --> 07:55.115
You're a patient, Sergeant.
It's a common feeling.

07:55.190 --> 07:59.923
Not to me it isn't.
I don't even know your first name.

08:00.529 --> 08:04.192
- I'm not allowed to tell you that.
- I know.

08:05.034 --> 08:08.140
- You should go back to sleep.
- I don't sleep.

08:09.271 --> 08:12.069
Then how can you have these nightmares?

08:12.441 --> 08:14.136
I don't know.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.197
Good night, Sergeant.

08:18.047 --> 08:19.833
Good night, Kestrel.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.557
What?

09:36.356 --> 09:42.101
I think I should take this opportunity to underscore
the elusive relationship between desire and social order.

09:42.129 --> 09:44.723
- You're crazy, aren't you?
- Crazy for you.

09:55.843 --> 09:56.703
David?

09:57.244 --> 10:00.441
- David?
- It's McKinnon.

10:00.490 --> 10:01.308
Yeah...

10:02.728 --> 10:05.312
Oh no...
No... David.

10:07.753 --> 10:09.543
It's okay.

10:09.556 --> 10:11.550
David?

10:11.653 --> 10:13.561
- Just breathe.
- You in yet?

10:14.553 --> 10:16.398
David?

10:25.337 --> 10:27.049
Are you okay?

10:28.785 --> 10:29.928
Let's go.

10:57.902 --> 10:59.688
Hello there, Mr. Harper.

11:13.017 --> 11:15.508
- Hello?
- We're in here.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.723
David?

11:22.293 --> 11:24.818
- Mr. McKinnon.
- Didn't show up for work this morning.

11:24.863 --> 11:29.618
Third time this month.
Sarah here tells me you had an attack...

11:30.068 --> 11:31.956
of your asthma things.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.909
- That's the truth, sir. I did.
- But now you're alright?

11:34.973 --> 11:38.113
I went down to the river.
Sometimes the humidity helps.

11:38.176 --> 11:41.828
Humidity.
Good one. That's good.

11:44.848 --> 11:47.590
I don't know how to put this,
but this job...

11:47.651 --> 11:52.566
I know it's just a local newspaper and I know
it's not going to change the outcome of the war or anything,

11:53.123 --> 11:56.160
but it's a good job, and your father...

11:57.995 --> 12:02.295
Well, you both understand that I'm doing this
for your father, don't you?

12:06.203 --> 12:08.239
Well, I'll just see myself out.

12:11.775 --> 12:14.460
I expect to see you in the morning.

12:19.750 --> 12:23.993
- I can't keep lying for you.
- I'm not asking you to.

12:24.054 --> 12:27.649
- Were you with Cassie?
- What if I was?

12:28.625 --> 12:31.582
Friends don't get friends in trouble, David.

12:31.661 --> 12:36.610
What would you know about friends?
All you've got is me and you don't even like me.

12:36.666 --> 12:38.452
Why do you talk like that?

12:39.035 --> 12:42.914
If there's anyone that doesn't like you,
it's you, not me.

12:42.972 --> 12:45.293
Is that supposed to pass for insight?

12:47.376 --> 12:49.867
By the way, her dad hates me too.

13:15.318 --> 13:17.003
- Good evening.
- Good evening, George.

13:21.977 --> 13:25.390
- Still no news?
- Still "missing in action."

13:25.447 --> 13:29.213
It's not easy, I can tell you that much.

13:30.485 --> 13:33.113
But I'm the Mayor, I can't be seen to falter,

13:33.188 --> 13:38.171
and our son has a good head on his shoulders,
so we remain hopeful.

13:48.370 --> 13:53.012
- Are you crazy?
- I'm here to talk to your father.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.931
Oh, hello. This is your friend.
David, isn't it?

13:57.245 --> 14:01.625
- Yes, sir. I wonder if I could have a word with you.
- By all means. Come on in.

14:02.550 --> 14:06.839
- No, sir... I don't want to intrude.
- Don't be silly. Come along.

14:13.961 --> 14:18.034
Hello, everybody.
I'd like to introduce you to David, uh...

14:18.065 --> 14:20.011
- Good Lord, I've forgotten your last name.
- It's Mann, sir.

14:20.068 --> 14:23.013
- David Mann.
- I'm very honored to meet you.

14:23.070 --> 14:27.848
It appears that young David
has conceived of a passion for my daughter.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.603
Daddy, please!

14:29.943 --> 14:33.231
A passion, is it? Well, then I'd be guessing
you'd still be a student.

14:33.297 --> 14:34.455
And you'd be wide of the mark.

14:34.548 --> 14:38.587
- David here counts himself among the ranks of the working men.
- I work for a newspaper.

14:38.619 --> 14:42.658
But he's not a scribe.
He sets type. He's a typesetter.

14:42.723 --> 14:43.917
Phil...

14:44.024 --> 14:47.061
But you must be 18 years old
and you're not in uniform. Why is that?

14:47.127 --> 14:50.403
It's a medical thing, sir.
He's doing what he can.

14:51.031 --> 14:54.171
Yes, well, he'll have to do better than that
if he wants to earn the respect of your father.

14:54.234 --> 14:59.000
That's what I intend to do, sir,
and I'm open to suggestions.

14:59.072 --> 15:03.771
For God's sake, son, we're at war.
Use your imagination.

15:11.818 --> 15:15.515
I'm sorry. I don't know,
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say.

15:17.090 --> 15:20.491
There's no formula here, Sergeant.
We're just talking.

15:21.694 --> 15:25.084
You, uh, want to tell me
about your nightmares?

15:28.801 --> 15:33.079
They consistently feature the image
of a Canadian soldier and a cross.

15:33.139 --> 15:35.130
Why is that, you imagine?

15:35.942 --> 15:40.436
I don't sleep, so I don't really know
how to answer that.

15:40.513 --> 15:42.743
In 1915, in retreat outside Ypres,

15:42.782 --> 15:46.308
German soldiers nailed a Canadian N.C.O.
to a barn door.

15:46.351 --> 15:48.046
You were there, were you not?

15:48.153 --> 15:52.157
Yes sir, I did take part in that retreat, but...

15:52.424 --> 15:55.717
if they had time to stop
and nail a guy to a door, they're...

15:55.977 --> 15:57.916
they're even better
than I already know them to be.

15:58.063 --> 16:01.146
- Are you saying it didn't happen?
- I'm saying artillery throws soldiers

16:01.199 --> 16:03.565
into positions you can't even imagine.

16:04.469 --> 16:09.406
A man in a trench...
he's gonna see what he needs to see.

16:12.611 --> 16:17.526
- Michael, you are a decorated soldier--
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

16:20.085 --> 16:23.828
And I received that medal for sticking
a 17-inch piece of steel into a boy's forehead.

16:23.889 --> 16:25.550
As soon as you were well enough to walk,
you went AWOL.

16:25.624 --> 16:27.660
I went AWOL because I received a medal

16:27.726 --> 16:30.058
for sticking a piece of steel
into a boy's forehead!

16:30.095 --> 16:33.882
- This is insubordinate!
- Understand your situation here, Sergeant.

16:34.231 --> 16:36.756
We are trying to determine
your status of discharge.

16:36.801 --> 16:38.837
Your physical wounds have,
for the most part, healed.

16:38.903 --> 16:41.827
Dr. Walker would like to give you
a clean bill of health,

16:41.906 --> 16:46.900
in which case you'd be sent back to the battlefield,
stand trial for desertion

16:46.977 --> 16:49.537
and more than likely be executed.

16:50.047 --> 16:54.290
I'm going to end up back there
one way or another.

16:54.785 --> 16:58.983
- Michael, I'm trying to save your life.
- I know that.

16:59.423 --> 17:01.914
And I appreciate it, I do, but... this...

17:09.733 --> 17:11.473
Go on.

17:11.502 --> 17:14.790
The house... we grew up in...

17:16.473 --> 17:21.194
it was at the bottom of this hill,
and every time one of my brothers, uh...

17:21.743 --> 17:23.530
- Died?
- Yeah.

17:27.150 --> 17:32.133
The telegraph guy, he'd bring the notification down the hill
and my mother never got any other news.

17:35.091 --> 17:39.755
After all, three of my younger brothers,
one, two, three and me, AWOL...

17:41.097 --> 17:43.770
And they don't say
"Absent without leave."

17:43.833 --> 17:47.951
They say "Missing in action",
which to her meant I was dead.

17:51.074 --> 17:54.885
So when that telegraph guy
came down the fourth time...

17:54.944 --> 17:56.730
it broke her heart.

17:58.882 --> 18:02.374
She... she died of a broken heart.

18:08.558 --> 18:11.778
Nurse Mann, would you please escort
the sergeant back to the ward.

18:23.071 --> 18:26.017
Major Nigel Bernard,
Canadian Army Medical Corps,

18:26.074 --> 18:29.362
re: patient T-331,
Sergeant Michael Dunne.

18:30.245 --> 18:32.930
Physically the patient nears repair.

18:33.282 --> 18:36.092
Diagnosis remains however neurasthenia,

18:36.151 --> 18:39.131
Dr. Walker's dissent noted.

18:39.755 --> 18:43.703
In light of his service record, the recommendation is
that the soldier be reassigned to the home front,

18:43.759 --> 18:48.605
possibly in recruitment,
in support of our ongoing effort.

18:59.273 --> 19:01.468
I came to wish you luck.

19:02.143 --> 19:04.998
It's not likely I'll see you again, is it?

19:06.781 --> 19:07.972
I don't want to leave.

19:08.091 --> 19:09.137
No...

19:10.484 --> 19:13.976
that's not accurate.
I don't want to leave you.

19:14.088 --> 19:18.297
- I'm not what you think I am.
- You don't know what I think you are.

19:18.326 --> 19:20.214
You talk in your sleep.

19:20.628 --> 19:23.301
I don't sleep.
How can I talk?

19:23.364 --> 19:28.154
- You don't even know my first name.
- No, I don't. No.

19:29.303 --> 19:32.101
And that's a hell of a thing, that is.

19:38.179 --> 19:40.875
- Good-bye, Nurse Mann.
- Bye.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.843
- It's Sarah.
- What?

19:48.722 --> 19:51.714
Her name... is Sarah.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.389
Thanks.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.353
Rigor, Sergeant.
Rigor is our shibboleth.

20:04.904 --> 20:09.796
No slight intended to my immediate predecessor,
but the sails on this ship are slack.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.976
The home front is awash
in saboteurs and provocateurs.

20:14.047 --> 20:18.677
Odd those words sound French, what?
Allies and all.

20:18.852 --> 20:22.037
Be that as it may,
our immediate concern is recruitment.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.624
Minimum age 18.

20:23.690 --> 20:28.673
Infantry, Service and Medical Corps: minimum height
5 foot 3 inches, chest 33 and one half inches.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.018
Gunners--
Carmichael, remove this.

20:31.528 --> 20:33.318
Ah, yes sir!

20:36.969 --> 20:38.869
Capital asset, Carmichael.

20:38.937 --> 20:42.691
Gunners: minimum height 5 foot 7 inches,
chest 34 and one half inches,

20:42.731 --> 20:45.218
give or take, you understand.

20:45.411 --> 20:49.552
Preference given to unmarried men.
The blind and the deaf are to be avoided,

20:49.615 --> 20:54.439
and asthmatics are strictly ne touche pas,
given the problems associated with gas.

20:54.486 --> 20:57.683
And on that note, may I say, in confidence...

21:01.360 --> 21:04.523
I have seen acts of depravity, Dunne.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.157
Kroonstad.
Human depravity.

21:07.933 --> 21:12.586
But gas?
Even the Boer would not sink so low.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.583
We use gas, sir.

21:14.640 --> 21:19.623
Of course we do.
Cut from the same cloth, you and I.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.429
A rarefying experience, combat.

21:24.549 --> 21:28.292
Something Carmichael will never encounter.
Blind as a bat, feet like a fried egg.

21:28.352 --> 21:31.742
- Isn't that right, Carmichael?
- More than right, sir.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.610
You saw action in South Africa, sir?

21:39.030 --> 21:41.772
I've studied your dossier, Sergeant.

21:41.933 --> 21:45.721
But you can rest easy.
I have my eye on you.

22:20.437 --> 22:24.680
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you
a Distinguished Conduct Medal winner,

22:24.741 --> 22:29.075
a proud member of Calgary's own 10th Battalion,
Second Brigade, First Canadian Division.

22:29.112 --> 22:32.400
Please rise for Sergeant Michael Dunne!

22:38.155 --> 22:40.100
I thought he'd be bigger.

22:40.157 --> 22:43.900
- In what sense?
- In the sense that he'd be bigger.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.305
Please, please.
You're embarrassing the good sergeant.

22:47.364 --> 22:50.356
Would all of those women who are present
please resume your seats?

22:54.104 --> 22:55.190
Thank you.

22:56.206 --> 23:00.983
And all those men too old to serve,
would you also resume your seats?

23:04.680 --> 23:09.640
And all the boys who are not yet of age to serve,
would you take your seats as well?

23:17.259 --> 23:22.162
And now, I ask you to look at the men
who stand amongst you...

23:26.735 --> 23:35.531
and explain to Sergeant Dunne why they are not doing
their part for their King, their country and their God!

23:44.420 --> 23:45.510
Kamerad.

23:53.528 --> 23:56.122
Eyes wide open.

24:01.836 --> 24:02.622
Next.

24:05.106 --> 24:08.098
- Name?
- David Mann.

24:10.111 --> 24:12.056
- What's your marital status, David?
- Single.

24:12.113 --> 24:15.560
- And you're of legal age?
- Look, I applied before.

24:15.583 --> 24:19.428
Yeah, I see that, and according to this form,
you were rejected because you have asthma.

24:19.487 --> 24:23.878
- Do you now have medical clearance on that asthma?
- I wouldn't be here, would I?

24:23.958 --> 24:26.597
And this isn't Germany.
I don't carry documents with me.

24:26.661 --> 24:30.108
You're in uniform, but you aren't at the front.
You have anything to document that?

24:30.164 --> 24:31.859
As a matter of fact I do.

24:31.966 --> 24:36.107
They diagnosed me as neurasthenic,
which means 'shell shock',

24:36.170 --> 24:39.991
which means I'm mentally incompetent,
and this is the paper that proves it.

24:41.975 --> 24:44.899
Haven't you ever heard of patriotism?

24:50.517 --> 24:53.862
Do you have a relative who's a nurse?
A sister or something?

24:54.087 --> 24:57.921
- And you live out on Stewart Avenue?
- Maybe.

24:58.825 --> 25:03.478
Okay, as long as I'm sitting at this desk,
you will not be going to this war.

25:04.197 --> 25:05.687
Next.

25:10.270 --> 25:11.158
Name.

25:20.847 --> 25:23.042
How's that feel, war hero?

25:33.559 --> 25:38.337
- You only got one arm.
- Sad, ain't it? How 'bout we get drunk?

25:39.734 --> 25:45.577
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey! Forget about the nurse!
There's a gaggle of women, all free and clear,

25:45.591 --> 25:48.882
- ready to hike up their skirts. You want to know why?
- 'Cause you give them money.

25:48.941 --> 25:52.490
No, because I let them know they are
in the presence of a real-life war hero.

25:52.545 --> 25:54.388
- When did you become a hero?
- When I lost my arm.

25:54.447 --> 25:56.893
- You lost your arm in a lumber mill.
- Which the ladies don't know,

25:56.949 --> 25:59.873
which is what I love about this war.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.807
Got a postcard from Highway.

26:04.156 --> 26:09.651
Seems like the Redskin's back on his feet, and by the sounds of it,
he's cutting a swath right through London town.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.383
That's what I hear.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.320
- Hey, John.
- Michael Dunne.

26:14.432 --> 26:17.572
- Lord God, it's good to see you in one piece.
- Oh, more or less.

26:17.635 --> 26:20.274
On the house, my friend. Your call.

26:20.338 --> 26:23.626
I'll have whatever you got underneath the counter.
I'll be back in a second.

26:23.675 --> 26:26.872
- Hey, Royster.
- To Dunne.

26:29.011 --> 26:30.341
Well, well, well...

26:30.482 --> 26:33.770
You two are so... jesusly rhetorical.

26:35.053 --> 26:40.322
This man who just left, this man
would not allow me to serve, and why?

26:40.457 --> 26:42.096
He's been over there.

26:42.160 --> 26:45.903
- He's run Fritz through with a bayonet.
- Johnny, what's this kid doing in here?

26:45.964 --> 26:48.944
- Time to go, son.
- Do I smell Kraut?

26:49.000 --> 26:53.175
- You calling me a Kraut, boy?
- You calling me a boy, Kraut?

26:53.238 --> 26:57.020
I'm just a one-armed man.
What are you trying to do here, kid?

26:57.076 --> 27:00.082
Mister...
I'm just trying to save my soul...

27:07.575 --> 27:09.177
Hey, leave the boy alone!

27:10.587 --> 27:12.578
Let it go, Roy.

27:17.294 --> 27:19.285
What, are you nuts?

27:20.030 --> 27:22.019
He would have killed you.
You know that?

27:29.373 --> 27:31.261
You come with me.

27:52.161 --> 27:56.439
- Thank you for bringing him home.
- You don't have to thank me.

27:56.499 --> 27:59.195
It's, uh, a good excuse to see you again.

27:59.735 --> 28:01.726
- Well, thank you anyway.
- Okay.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.434
Hey...

28:11.747 --> 28:14.910
Do you think maybe I could accompany you
to a dance or...?

28:15.618 --> 28:19.714
- I don't dance with soldiers.
- I could lose the uniform.

28:19.789 --> 28:22.178
I don't dance with naked soldiers.

28:23.092 --> 28:25.083
I'm trying to flirt.

28:25.261 --> 28:28.207
- And I'm not making it easy, am I?
- No.

28:28.264 --> 28:31.244
What if I asked your father for permission?

28:32.268 --> 28:36.034
- That would be difficult.
- He doesn't like suitors?

28:37.373 --> 28:42.275
No. My father's dead, Sergeant.
He was killed on Vimy Ridge.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.982
Ah, Jesus.

28:47.516 --> 28:49.302
I'm sorry.

28:52.053 --> 28:53.839
I'm really sorry.

28:56.925 --> 28:59.415
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:34.261 --> 29:36.752
Ah Christ, that's harsh.

29:42.503 --> 29:44.528
Lot of rum over there, I guess.

29:45.539 --> 29:49.794
- Yeah, but they water it down.
- Plentiful though, no?

29:49.877 --> 29:53.335
- If there's a show on.
- Battle, you mean?

29:53.380 --> 29:56.577
Christ, that word's got a ring.

29:57.818 --> 29:59.604
It's like...

30:00.854 --> 30:03.345
It must be like top of the world.

30:04.692 --> 30:07.274
And all the shit these Krauts get up to!

30:07.328 --> 30:10.832
- They crucified one of our guys, for God's sake!
- That never happened.

30:10.898 --> 30:13.037
- Still.
- No, it's a good story.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.954
- It just never happened.
- Still...

30:18.274 --> 30:19.534
You know...

30:20.940 --> 30:22.726
I follow it.

30:24.110 --> 30:29.725
Lot of people, they take it, leave it.
But me?

30:30.183 --> 30:35.172
Every day come five o'clock I got a paper
in my hand, nose right to the print.

30:35.655 --> 30:40.581
Every step you two take, you and Highway,
I'm right there with it.

30:41.361 --> 30:45.264
And it ain't just the liquor talking,
but I am.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.788
You're what?

30:48.902 --> 30:53.047
- Okay, Mikey. I am.
- Okay, you're what?

30:53.940 --> 30:55.635
Proud.

30:56.009 --> 30:57.795
I'm proud of you.

30:59.245 --> 31:01.133
And I'll tell you something else,

31:01.414 --> 31:05.741
if I didn't have this stump, I'd be right
between you and Highway on the firing step,

31:05.745 --> 31:08.296
right in the middle of it.

31:09.921 --> 31:11.707
That'd be me.

31:38.250 --> 31:42.553
I know you don't dance with soldiers,
but do you think maybe you could go ride with one?

32:40.477 --> 32:42.320
Did you carve this?

32:43.913 --> 32:46.052
No. No, it was whiskey carved that.

32:46.449 --> 32:49.282
I ran a mining camp up near
Rocky Mountain House.

32:49.352 --> 32:52.844
The gold ran dry about the same time
the war started up, so...

32:53.723 --> 32:57.638
I figured I'd go sign up and...
go get killed.

32:58.695 --> 33:00.981
Can I ask you something, Sergeant?

33:02.432 --> 33:06.323
Do you think maybe you could call me,
uh, you could call me Michael?

33:07.971 --> 33:09.962
Were you at Vimy Ridge?

33:11.307 --> 33:13.753
I did attend that fight, yeah.

33:14.844 --> 33:16.835
What was it like?

33:21.184 --> 33:23.175
It was cold.

33:28.224 --> 33:32.068
But we took that ridge and we held it.
Nobody else did that.

33:32.127 --> 33:36.530
The British couldn't do it; the French couldn't do it.
It was just us, the Canadian Corps.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.089
You should be proud of your father.

33:42.104 --> 33:45.688
- I am.
- And it's not common, by the way.

33:47.843 --> 33:51.131
- What isn't?
- This feeling.

33:59.855 --> 34:01.846
Would you do something for me?

34:02.524 --> 34:05.015
I think I'd do just about anything for you.

34:07.129 --> 34:11.589
Tell me about this.
Paint me a picture of it.

34:12.234 --> 34:16.898
- I'm not a painter.
- I'm not all that particular.

34:17.062 --> 34:18.420
Okay.

34:19.516 --> 34:20.590
Um...

34:26.813 --> 34:33.512
In this picture, there is a river and, uh,
there's a horse, and there's a man sitting that horse...

34:34.088 --> 34:37.080
and together they ford that river.

34:37.891 --> 34:40.507
And all these things are in the Foothills.

34:43.097 --> 34:46.998
And the man rides to a place he thought
he knew like the back of his hand.

34:47.068 --> 34:50.344
But there's something about this day
that's different.

34:50.404 --> 34:52.292
Why this day?

34:53.574 --> 34:55.417
There's a woman with him.

34:57.278 --> 34:59.064
Is this woman frightened?

34:59.814 --> 35:01.896
You'd have to ask her.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.546
What about him?

35:06.663 --> 35:08.717
Well...

35:09.222 --> 35:14.068
that's the thing.
He doesn't have a word for this,

35:14.995 --> 35:16.781
for what he feels.

35:17.323 --> 35:21.173
All day long he searches for it,
and it's not 'til he's sitting next to the woman

35:21.234 --> 35:25.396
- and they're looking over a river he can finally put a name to it.
- You should stop.

35:32.512 --> 35:37.154
In a heartbeat I could fall so hard...

35:40.587 --> 35:42.475
but I'm-- I'm not...

35:45.625 --> 35:48.014
I'm broken... somewhere.

35:49.029 --> 35:50.724
Quite broken.

35:52.732 --> 35:56.258
So I'd start to think you were stupid
for loving me.

35:56.302 --> 36:01.080
Then I'd begin to resent you and eventually,
I would hate you.

36:15.254 --> 36:16.744
I should go.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.650
Really, I'd...
I really rather you didn't.

36:22.394 --> 36:23.986
I know.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.809
I'm, uh...

36:30.235 --> 36:32.430
I'm just gonna sit here for a bit.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.731
You can keep that horse.

36:54.025 --> 36:58.553
The soldier in the modern battlefield
is beset with many challenges,

36:58.629 --> 37:00.267
most notably artillery.

37:00.331 --> 37:05.598
Tissue damage results from shell fragments,
which are irregular in shape.

37:05.837 --> 37:10.319
Wounds are therefore jagged or,
at best, unpredictable.

37:10.842 --> 37:15.438
In the soft parts,
wounds show deep and extensive attritions

37:15.580 --> 37:19.175
and are marked by extensive effusion
of blood and or serum.

37:20.318 --> 37:25.713
Invariably, shell fragments will introduce
foreign matter into the wound,

37:25.826 --> 37:27.713
making infection inevitable.

37:28.359 --> 37:30.622
Your father wrote this.

37:30.731 --> 37:31.801
Jesus.

37:31.995 --> 37:33.587
Pretty scary, eh?

37:34.031 --> 37:36.625
- Are you scared?
- No. Are you?

37:37.506 --> 37:38.731
No.

37:39.936 --> 37:43.123
Do you want to introduce
some foreign matter into me?

37:44.408 --> 37:46.182
Why should we wait?

37:56.386 --> 38:00.374
Contused wounds are vast erosions,

38:00.424 --> 38:03.882
large lesions forming a cul-de-sac...

38:05.595 --> 38:10.986
They are abrasions with torn surfaces
and quivering and herniated muscles.

38:11.168 --> 38:18.119
They are doomed to suppuration and are threatened
by grave complications such as gangrene and tetanus.

38:18.375 --> 38:19.966
In summary...

38:20.276 --> 38:22.858
artillery shells will splinter...

38:23.579 --> 38:30.178
amputate, decapitate, bisect, quarter
or otherwise grossly mutilate the human frame.

38:31.220 --> 38:36.123
In the worst of cases,
a direct explosion will obliterate the man.

38:36.859 --> 38:39.851
The soldier will simply disappear.

38:40.963 --> 38:42.749
Thank you.

38:52.808 --> 38:57.829
- Sergeant, you have anything to add to this subject?
- No. No, that's pretty much what it does.

38:57.880 --> 39:02.806
So you would agree that artillery represents
the greatest challenge to an individual on the battlefield?

39:17.832 --> 39:20.153
Sergeant, do you agree?

39:21.603 --> 39:24.106
No, sir. I'm sorry, I don't.

39:26.307 --> 39:29.413
The single greatest challenge to an individual
on the battlefield...

39:30.912 --> 39:33.528
is trying to keep his matches dry.

39:37.986 --> 39:43.913
"Keep your matches dry?" One of the wittier phrases Dr. Walker
singles out as having turned his lecture into a farce.

39:43.956 --> 39:44.765
Sir, I didn't mean--

39:44.826 --> 39:47.169
- You have permission to speak?
- No, sir, you did not.

39:47.228 --> 39:50.629
- These are the drawings of your machine?
- They are.

39:51.065 --> 39:54.102
- You had a diagnosis, did you not?
- Yes, sir. Neurasthenia.

39:54.169 --> 39:56.853
And I think, we both know what "that" means.

39:57.104 --> 40:00.972
- Your draftsmanship is impressive.
- You're holding them upside down.

40:01.041 --> 40:02.736
So I am.

40:09.850 --> 40:12.239
and what I see disturbs me.

40:12.819 --> 40:20.112
You'll notice I've left out certain mechanical secrets
that can only be revealed upon payment of one million dollars.

40:20.360 --> 40:25.150
A lovely round figure. And what exactly
will this invention of yours accomplish?

40:26.033 --> 40:28.775
It will bring the war to an end in 48 hours.

40:29.036 --> 40:32.437
Delightful.
And how exactly will it achieve that?

40:32.706 --> 40:39.100
With this machine, an individual can circle the globe
in exactly 15 minutes.

40:40.581 --> 40:42.367
Sparkling.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.037
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

40:46.021 --> 40:47.531
- Thank you--
- No, I thank you!

40:47.785 --> 40:50.571
- Thank you very much.
- No! Thank you!

40:52.124 --> 40:55.002
The very ground we are standing on is shifting.

40:55.061 --> 40:58.701
Civilization hangs in the balance,
so I offer a word of warning:

40:58.764 --> 41:01.210
Do not plow a foreign field.

41:01.467 --> 41:04.504
Sir, I just don't see
what this has to do with dry matches.

41:04.570 --> 41:07.710
For God's sake, man!
We are talking about our nation's security,

41:07.773 --> 41:10.810
which means we are talking about
a certain lady named Sarah Mann,

41:10.876 --> 41:14.744
on whose attendance, I am reliably informed,
you have been dancing.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.226
More specifically,
we are talking about her father.

41:17.283 --> 41:19.729
Her father was a soldier
who fought on the same ridge I did.

41:19.785 --> 41:22.731
The only difference I'm aware of
is that he died and I didn't.

41:22.788 --> 41:24.983
The only difference you're aware of?

41:25.232 --> 41:26.816
Carmichael!

41:29.328 --> 41:32.273
"Martin Mann was born in Ingolstadt, Bavaria.

41:32.330 --> 41:38.155
He returned to his native land in 1915 and was assigned
to the Second Bavarian Reserve Regiment."

41:39.437 --> 41:43.771
- He fought for the enemy.
- The blood is tainted, Sergeant.

41:43.842 --> 41:48.677
Ottawa mandates that we must root out the Hun
in sheep's clothing, and root him out we will.

41:49.047 --> 41:50.742
Like a pig.

41:54.786 --> 41:57.732
- With regret our mandate is uncompromising.
- You regret nothing.

41:57.789 --> 42:02.849
I don't expect a woman to comprehend this,
but our country is rife with saboteurs.

42:02.994 --> 42:06.441
When did nursing wounded soldiers
become a threat to the homeland?

42:06.498 --> 42:08.238
If I'm so dangerous,
why don't you lock me up?

42:08.300 --> 42:11.042
At the moment internment
is not under consideration.

42:12.203 --> 42:16.242
Listen to him! Listen to the sound of his voice!
How long has he been living in this country?

42:16.308 --> 42:19.027
My duration of residency is hardly the point.

42:19.077 --> 42:23.001
- I've lived here my entire life! I'm a Canadian!
- Technically, yes.

42:23.080 --> 42:28.063
But here's the sticky wicket, whereas I was born
under the sun of the British Empire,

42:28.319 --> 42:32.562
you, Miss Mann, were born
under the cloud of Germany.

43:33.783 --> 43:36.399
We could move. Start over.

43:36.619 --> 43:40.407
- Or I could try to find another job.
- Doing what?

43:41.724 --> 43:45.603
- I don't know. Cleaning maybe?
- Cleaning...

43:46.362 --> 43:48.148
This is our home.

43:49.065 --> 43:51.056
These are our neighbors.

43:51.367 --> 43:54.165
You can't hate a dead man, David.

43:55.104 --> 43:59.483
- And where is that writ, oh sister of mine?
- Don't talk like that. You sound ridiculous.

43:59.541 --> 44:04.149
I don't hate our father. He shames me.
There's a difference.

44:05.580 --> 44:08.435
If I could kill him, I would.

44:08.750 --> 44:13.653
- He can only be killed once.
- Well, I'm not just going to sit here.

44:13.688 --> 44:16.486
- Where are you going?
- What does it matter?

44:55.095 --> 44:56.585
- Sarah?
- I'm in here.

45:03.804 --> 45:06.489
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

45:06.574 --> 45:11.489
He may have gone to Cassie's, or maybe
our mother's grave. He does that quite often.

45:12.046 --> 45:16.164
I'll take that horse and go find him.
I don't think you should stay here.

45:16.217 --> 45:18.777
I want you to go to my place.

45:19.620 --> 45:24.569
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I fought on the same ridge your father died on.

45:24.892 --> 45:28.100
It might have been me that killed him.
I know it probably wasn't,

45:28.162 --> 45:30.050
but it might have been.

45:32.266 --> 45:36.029
Use that door. It's 213 Stephen Avenue.
I'll come find you.

45:37.170 --> 45:38.660
Thank you.

45:45.845 --> 45:47.836
You mind if I have a word with you?

45:54.020 --> 45:55.408
My nose...

46:05.632 --> 46:07.623
Schmidt! Dead German!

46:11.838 --> 46:14.830
Wutz! Dead German!

46:22.681 --> 46:24.467
"Mutti...

46:25.083 --> 46:28.723
- Ich liebe dich."
- Will you stop that now?

46:31.857 --> 46:35.315
Ah, come on, kid.
Don't make me chase you.

46:37.068 --> 46:39.019
Goddamnit!

47:01.991 --> 47:02.910
Shit!

47:16.400 --> 47:18.891
Idiot!
What the hell's wrong with you?!

47:19.003 --> 47:22.120
- Why don't you just kill me?
- I don't want to kill you, just want to talk to you.

47:22.173 --> 47:25.995
- You should have signed me up!
- You want to go to war that badly?

47:29.013 --> 47:31.152
Where do you think I already am?

47:31.749 --> 47:33.387
Jesus! Look around you!

47:33.451 --> 47:38.093
Everything you can see, everything you can imagine,
the entire goddamned universe is at war!

47:38.155 --> 47:42.694
And if that ever stopped, oh boy,
that would be the end of history!

47:43.427 --> 47:46.043
I don't know what you're talking about.

47:46.731 --> 47:49.074
All I know is that you got
to draw a line somewhere.

47:49.133 --> 47:51.340
And I draw the line at my father.

47:51.402 --> 47:55.099
- You think it's that simple?
- You don't?

47:57.475 --> 47:59.260
No. No, I don't.

48:00.877 --> 48:02.868
Lines are tricky...

48:03.880 --> 48:06.303
There's so goddamned many of them.

48:06.349 --> 48:08.840
There's front line, sap line, behind the line,

48:08.918 --> 48:13.127
lines you don't even know about,
lines you can't see 'til you cross them...

48:13.189 --> 48:15.783
but once you do, you're not fit.

48:15.992 --> 48:17.687
You understand?

48:18.128 --> 48:23.088
You're not fit for this world.
You live over there. You got men underneath you.

48:29.072 --> 48:31.757
What the hell am I doing?

48:35.345 --> 48:39.569
Christ didn't die for our sins.
He just laid down the template, that`s all.

48:41.951 --> 48:45.762
- I don't understand you.
- If I have my way, you never will.

48:45.822 --> 48:49.416
You're looking for romance, kid.
You're not going to find it in a trench.

48:49.458 --> 48:52.245
Get up.
I'm going to go find that horse.

49:06.842 --> 49:08.537
Sergeant.

49:09.029 --> 49:09.987
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:10.679 --> 49:14.308
I found your brother, and he's gonna stay
with a friend of mine.

49:14.349 --> 49:16.635
I'm just on the corner.

49:35.204 --> 49:38.991
Uh, you can have the bed.
It hasn't been slept in.

49:45.780 --> 49:50.023
This could get a little rocky.
You saw the morphine.

49:51.719 --> 49:54.256
When I was 23,
I robbed a bank in Fort Macleod.

49:54.322 --> 49:58.918
- I don't do it every day.
- I don't rob banks every day.

49:58.993 --> 50:02.565
After my father left, um,
I had trouble sleeping,

50:02.630 --> 50:06.578
and there was this ready supply
at the hospital.

50:08.102 --> 50:10.002
I can't explain it.

50:10.138 --> 50:12.129
You don't have to.

52:26.604 --> 52:29.141
I've tried everything I can to do my part but--

52:29.207 --> 52:33.064
But you were frustrated.
No, I understand that.

52:33.177 --> 52:36.749
And I commend you, son.
I commend your selflessness.

52:36.814 --> 52:41.410
It would seem my daughter has indeed
picked herself a fine young man.

52:44.822 --> 52:48.679
Present this letter to the recruiting officer
and your way should be clear.

52:48.760 --> 52:51.398
And with that,
you have my blessing on your union.

52:51.461 --> 52:52.951
Oh, Daddy!

52:56.633 --> 52:59.079
It tore my father in half, this war.

52:59.236 --> 53:01.830
It just made our lives...

53:03.373 --> 53:07.594
impossible.
So I forced him to make a decision.

53:07.878 --> 53:09.869
It was them or us.

53:11.214 --> 53:14.433
I really didn't think he'd leave or...

53:15.352 --> 53:17.912
that I was sending him to be killed...

53:19.856 --> 53:22.848
which seems to be killing my brother...

53:25.629 --> 53:29.611
All this. For what?

53:34.705 --> 53:36.696
I killed a kid.

53:38.808 --> 53:42.153
I killed a lot of men,
but I killed this one kid.

53:45.514 --> 53:47.505
He had these blue eyes.

53:51.053 --> 53:53.044
They were like water.

53:56.726 --> 54:00.844
And I didn't have to kill him.
I wasn't scared or...

54:05.201 --> 54:07.192
I just killed him.

54:17.013 --> 54:19.937
I'm going to have to answer for that.

54:21.150 --> 54:23.141
One way or another.

54:26.821 --> 54:30.336
Congratulations, son!
You've proven yourself a true patriot.

54:30.458 --> 54:35.350
Excuse me, sir. But I can't imagine Sergeant Dunne
rejecting a candidate without cause.

54:35.397 --> 54:38.036
And this form identifies the cause as asthma.

54:38.099 --> 54:39.748
- Do you have asthma, son?
- Not me, sir.

54:39.801 --> 54:41.473
- There you go. Fit as a fiddle.
- But sir...

54:41.536 --> 54:43.322
Shut up, Carmichael!

54:43.705 --> 54:47.926
In your encounters with Sergeant Dunne
he bore no signs of ill health, did he?

54:47.976 --> 54:53.539
- And yet he is not in the field. Why is that, do you imagine?
- He told me he had neurasthenia.

54:57.018 --> 55:00.055
The military is a curious and beautiful beast.

55:00.355 --> 55:05.076
Neurasthenia is our way of saying
that Sergeant Dunne is a coward.

55:08.329 --> 55:13.756
I've always thought that, way down, somewhere,
it was all about sacrifice. Why? I don't know.

55:14.368 --> 55:16.154
And now there's you.

55:17.871 --> 55:20.669
If I asked you, would you kiss me?

55:21.075 --> 55:22.861
Ask me.

55:30.117 --> 55:32.108
There's only one rule...

55:34.655 --> 55:36.441
don't die.

56:14.193 --> 56:16.923
- What are you doing?
- I'm going.

56:16.963 --> 56:19.056
- Where?
- Where do you think?

56:21.200 --> 56:25.580
Oh God, David! Please don't.
No. No. I won't have this.

56:25.739 --> 56:27.099
- You're a boy.
- I'm not a boy!

56:27.131 --> 56:29.382
- You have asthma!
- I'm not a cripple!

56:29.386 --> 56:30.219
God, they can't let you...

56:30.243 --> 56:32.889
David, talk to Sergeant Dunne.
He'll tell you not to go.

56:32.945 --> 56:35.891
- Really?
- He would explain to them, they would let you out.

56:35.948 --> 56:37.688
What makes you think they'd listen to him?

56:37.750 --> 56:42.653
You think he's some kind of hero?
Is he missing an arm? A leg? Is he blind?

56:44.690 --> 56:46.931
- Why isn't he still over there?
- I don't know.

56:46.993 --> 56:51.144
He's got neurasthenia! You know what that means
in the army? The man's a coward.

56:51.196 --> 56:53.039
- No. No, he's not!
- No, he's not?

56:54.432 --> 56:57.287
Who do you think signed me up?

56:57.769 --> 57:00.215
He's the reason I'm going to war.

57:09.509 --> 57:11.677
Oh, my God...

57:17.989 --> 57:23.529
Gentlemen, I'm honored to have you in my home
to observe this solemn and hopeful occasion.

57:23.995 --> 57:25.883
I turn it over to you, Major.

57:26.164 --> 57:31.124
Gentlemen, the eastbound train carries our valiant youth
on the long road to glory.

57:31.369 --> 57:33.815
May God go with them.
To the boys.

57:33.872 --> 57:35.612
- To the boys!
- To the men.

57:35.674 --> 57:37.969
- To the men!
- Hear hear.

57:55.659 --> 57:57.604
This is how you raise an army?

57:57.661 --> 58:02.132
You rake the very bottom and find the weak,
the young, the sick and you send them?

58:02.199 --> 58:05.646
My brother is just a boy!
He's not well; he's not fit!

58:05.703 --> 58:07.694
Why do you want him?

58:10.941 --> 58:13.933
Oh, you have nothing to say?
Nothing at all?

58:15.212 --> 58:18.249
This isn't out of the blue, Sergeant.

58:18.849 --> 58:20.635
I'm not out of the blue.

58:20.718 --> 58:25.621
I'm right here, right now and I'm asking you:
who will be there to watch over my brother?

59:00.156 --> 59:02.533
You know you can take anyone of them.

59:02.692 --> 59:06.531
Artillery, gas, wire, rain, rats,
the fucking bayonet...

59:06.595 --> 59:10.316
Not one of these can you control.
The matches you can control.

59:10.366 --> 59:12.812
You can have some effect upon them.

59:13.169 --> 59:15.808
If you're in the middle of a barrage
and you think a smoke might steady you up

59:15.871 --> 59:18.613
and you reach for those matches
and they're wet...

59:20.475 --> 59:22.466
well sir, your whole world buckles.

59:23.945 --> 59:26.800
It feels like it's coming apart at the seams.

59:27.783 --> 59:29.671
And that's not farce.

59:30.018 --> 59:31.906
That is not farce.

59:37.025 --> 59:38.811
I need you to sign this.

59:49.838 --> 59:53.330
- McRea?
- It's my mother's maiden name.

59:55.043 --> 59:58.740
I'm going back and you're gonna assign me
to the Fighting 10th.

01:00:01.316 --> 01:00:04.295
You're going to try and protect that boy?

01:00:09.824 --> 01:00:12.201
You really are neurasthenic, aren't you?

01:00:14.261 --> 01:00:16.855
Cut from the same cloth, you and I.

01:00:20.034 --> 01:00:22.525
You know I'll track you down.

01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:24.925
Be my guest.

01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:38.817
- Miss Mann?
- Come in.

01:01:41.213 --> 01:01:45.445
- Oh, hello, Cassie.
- How could anyone do this?

01:01:46.518 --> 01:01:48.213
I don't know.

01:01:50.055 --> 01:01:52.194
Why are you packing?

01:01:53.025 --> 01:01:56.290
I can't find a job,
so I can't afford the upkeep.

01:01:56.361 --> 01:02:00.206
I could talk to my father.
I mean, you're almost family.

01:02:00.265 --> 01:02:02.256
How is that, do you imagine?

01:02:03.902 --> 01:02:07.326
- You haven't heard from David?
- No.

01:02:07.372 --> 01:02:11.911
I haven't heard from him either,
which is strange considering we're engaged.

01:02:11.977 --> 01:02:14.616
- You're engaged?
- That's the whole reason he joined up.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.820
'Cause my father has his 'ways'
and David had to prove himself.

01:02:17.883 --> 01:02:21.944
- Is that why Dunne signed him up?
- You mean that Sergeant?

01:02:22.287 --> 01:02:24.551
God, no.
He had nothing to do with it.

01:02:25.424 --> 01:02:26.868
I-- I don't understand.

01:02:26.925 --> 01:02:29.848
He wasn't going to sign David up
come hell or high water.

01:02:29.927 --> 01:02:32.066
I had to get my father to write
this medical thing saying--

01:02:32.129 --> 01:02:34.723
- So it wasn't Sergeant Dunne?
- No.

01:02:34.759 --> 01:02:37.085
It was the other one, the British one.

01:02:38.236 --> 01:02:39.931
Oh, my God!

01:02:41.639 --> 01:02:43.834
I'm sorry, I... I don't...

01:02:44.613 --> 01:02:47.552
- What have you done?
- What do you mean?

01:02:48.613 --> 01:02:50.752
Your father doesn't want David to come home.

01:02:50.815 --> 01:02:55.798
He wants him to stay over there with a white cross
to mark his spot for the rest of time.

01:02:56.454 --> 01:02:58.149
What are you saying?

01:03:17.542 --> 01:03:21.536
<i>"Dearest Sarah,
I'm not sure if you'll get this.</i>

01:03:21.576 --> 01:03:24.936
<i>I don't know if I'm only good
at painting these pictures, but I am trying.</i>

01:03:25.982 --> 01:03:31.784
<i>In this picture there is a river and there is a horse
and there is a man sitting that horse,</i>

01:03:32.022 --> 01:03:35.423
<i>and all these things are in the Foothills...</i>

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.363
<i>And when this man closes his eyes...</i>

01:03:40.263 --> 01:03:44.563
<i>he can see a woman kissing him
as like as to smother him.</i>

01:03:45.168 --> 01:03:49.650
<i>And this man knows that kings may die
and countries may crumble,</i>

01:03:49.706 --> 01:03:53.893
<i>but if people look close enough,
they just might, as I have, Sarah,</i>

01:03:54.878 --> 01:03:58.996
<i>they just might find something to believe in.</i>

01:03:59.316 --> 01:04:04.299
<i>I have to go now, but before I do,
remember that rule...</i>

01:04:05.188 --> 01:04:06.973
<i>don't die."</i>

01:04:59.169 --> 01:05:00.053
Go on.

01:05:14.922 --> 01:05:17.208
Let him go! Let him go!

01:05:55.909 --> 01:05:56.910
Wait up!

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:06.910
- Okay, sound off!
- What's in the bag, Lieutenant?

01:06:06.973 --> 01:06:08.317
In a minute. Sound off!

01:06:08.375 --> 01:06:09.512
- Highway.
- Cahill.

01:06:09.576 --> 01:06:10.918
- Godin.
- Witchell.

01:06:10.977 --> 01:06:12.217
- Horne.
- Miles.

01:06:13.046 --> 01:06:15.219
- Johnson.
- Mann.

01:06:15.844 --> 01:06:16.513
McRea.

01:06:17.451 --> 01:06:20.193
Here we go!
A little gift from the C.O.

01:06:20.387 --> 01:06:22.412
A "Last Supper" kind of thing.

01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:24.230
Let's get yourselves together, gentlemen!

01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:26.987
Get that bird plucked.
I need to check in with H.Q.

01:06:30.464 --> 01:06:34.047
- Nice form. Had practice with that?
- Just around the house.

01:06:36.135 --> 01:06:37.921
You want me to give you a hand with that?

01:06:39.071 --> 01:06:42.655
For the last goddamned time,
I don't need your help.

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:48.266
Hey, MPs.
The RSM's with them.

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:51.269
Form up!

01:06:56.388 --> 01:06:57.878
McRea!

01:07:24.087 --> 01:07:25.048
H.Q.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.952
Private McRea, sir.

01:07:36.661 --> 01:07:39.494
Last time I met you,
your name was Michael Dunne.

01:07:39.531 --> 01:07:41.726
April 22nd, Kitchener's Wood.

01:07:41.833 --> 01:07:44.825
820 men went in; 174 came out.

01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:49.520
Lieutenant Hanson, Second Field Artillery.
Immediate response.

01:07:49.574 --> 01:07:51.041
We were getting mauled, Major Bingham.

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:55.034
Dunne here had a bullet in his thigh.
Crawled across a field of corpses to get us support.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.422
Should have been a V.C.

01:07:57.482 --> 01:08:00.701
Unacceptable.
I want a 'yes' within the hour.

01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:04.621
- Mr. Watchman.
- Sir.

01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:07.924
You mind having that conversation
with Lt. Maxwell?

01:08:07.991 --> 01:08:10.312
- Outside, if you could?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:11.862 --> 01:08:14.183
Major, you want to step forward?

01:08:22.506 --> 01:08:24.747
Turns out you falsified some records.

01:08:24.808 --> 01:08:28.846
Somewhat aggressively, according to Dobson-Hughes here,
and he wants your head.

01:08:28.912 --> 01:08:30.899
- So... what do I do?
- You have to turn him in, Col--

01:08:30.913 --> 01:08:33.091
I wasn't asking you, Major.

01:08:33.383 --> 01:08:35.772
What do I do with you, Dunne?

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.924
- I suppose he's right, sir.
- Alright, then. That's what I'll do.

01:08:39.957 --> 01:08:44.644
But I'm not going to turn you in to the military police,
I'm going to turn you into a platoon leader.

01:08:44.862 --> 01:08:46.944
And you will hold your tongue, Major.

01:08:47.064 --> 01:08:50.625
Maxwell will come back to H.Q.
with us and Dunne.

01:08:50.701 --> 01:08:53.147
You're going to take over 'Number 2' platoon.

01:08:55.706 --> 01:08:59.152
This party we call Passchendaele
started three months ago,

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:02.564
but it's been raining ever since,
so the battlefield's like a bowl of stew

01:09:02.612 --> 01:09:04.352
and the whole thing's stalled,

01:09:04.412 --> 01:09:07.859
so the job of breaking out falls
to the only outfit in this entire circus

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:10.658
that seems capable of getting anything done,
and that's us,

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.915
the Canadian Corps.

01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:18.354
You know they got a name for us?
The enemy?

01:09:18.426 --> 01:09:20.509
They call us 'storm troopers'.

01:09:20.863 --> 01:09:24.651
- Major Bingham?
- The assault has two thrusts.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.014
On the right, brigades from 2nd Division
will clear the village of Passchendaele.

01:09:29.071 --> 01:09:33.019
On the left, the Little Black Devils
and the 7th Battalion, with us in support,

01:09:33.075 --> 01:09:35.566
will attack along the Mosselmarkt-Meetcheele Road.

01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:40.756
This is the assault front; this is our support line;
and this is battalion headquarters.

01:09:40.816 --> 01:09:42.555
And we have three objectives:

01:09:42.618 --> 01:09:45.529
Venture Farm, Vindictive Crossroads

01:09:45.553 --> 01:09:48.545
and Hill 52.
That's where we stop and dig in.

01:09:49.991 --> 01:09:51.982
These are your battle orders.

01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:55.883
- You got any questions?
- No, sir.

01:09:56.398 --> 01:09:58.389
Well, I got one.

01:09:59.401 --> 01:10:03.280
You were free and clear of this freak show.
Why'd you come back?

01:10:05.774 --> 01:10:07.765
For love, sir.

01:10:09.077 --> 01:10:12.672
That's a sorry bastard reason.
Good luck, Dunne.

01:10:16.952 --> 01:10:21.127
With respect, sir,
I feel compelled to lodge a formal complaint!

01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:24.272
This is no time for personal vendettas, Major.

01:10:24.326 --> 01:10:28.956
In case you haven't noticed, we're neck deep in hell
and Currie's projecting 16,000 casualties.

01:10:28.997 --> 01:10:32.524
The General's never wrong so I need soldiers.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:38.253
Now I'm not sure I count you as one but I'm going
to keep you close. It might improve your chances.

01:10:39.306 --> 01:10:42.594
I bow to your superior judgment, sir.

01:10:52.052 --> 01:10:54.589
Not sure what I should say to the men.

01:10:54.655 --> 01:10:57.203
- You know, sir, I didn't ask for this.
- I know.

01:10:57.257 --> 01:10:59.896
It's funny, though.
You come all this way...

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.746
You got a light?

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:08.429
We need a stretcher bearer here!

01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:34.930
- I need a doctor!
- We all need a doctor.

01:11:35.862 --> 01:11:37.818
Here. Put him down here, soldier.

01:12:02.088 --> 01:12:03.874
Oh, my God.

01:12:09.362 --> 01:12:11.317
We have to take his jacket off.

01:12:15.634 --> 01:12:17.124
What are you doing here?

01:12:17.169 --> 01:12:20.411
It's what I'm good at.
And where else was I going to go?

01:12:20.472 --> 01:12:22.360
Anywhere but here, Sarah.
Jesus.

01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:24.659
I volunteered out of Regina.

01:12:24.743 --> 01:12:26.756
- Royster helped me.
- How'd you get here?

01:12:26.812 --> 01:12:29.781
It took me a month to catch up to you.

01:12:29.848 --> 01:12:32.294
It's okay. You'll be fine.

01:12:33.618 --> 01:12:35.256
- How's David?
- Okay. He's with me.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.118
- We're keeping our heads down.
- Oh God...

01:12:38.757 --> 01:12:41.373
They're going to make you leave.

01:12:41.493 --> 01:12:43.358
- My shift is over soon.
- Okay.

01:12:43.428 --> 01:12:46.374
Picadilly and King's Cross.
I'll meet you there.

01:12:46.431 --> 01:12:48.217
You can go now, soldier.

01:12:51.048 --> 01:12:54.009
Clear the truck!
We've got enough for everyone here!

01:13:01.476 --> 01:13:03.444
Make way! Coming through!

01:13:04.946 --> 01:13:06.998
- Fall in!
- Yes, sir!

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:51.688
- Are you worried?
- Yeah.

01:13:51.717 --> 01:13:53.009
Don't be.

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:57.383
We're just a support company.
We won't even see action.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:00.108
- What about David?
- If I could get you to him I would;

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:01.808
but it's not safe past here.

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:05.011
But I promise you this:
I will bring your brother home.

01:14:05.074 --> 01:14:06.894
Look what I made you come back to.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.922
It wasn't you, Sarah.

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:12.926
I was going to end up back here
one way or another.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:09.296
All companies A through F, battle muster,
we're heading in!

01:16:09.338 --> 01:16:10.773
Men, fall in!

01:16:10.865 --> 01:16:12.650
I have to go.

01:16:19.572 --> 01:16:21.597
Can you give this to David?

01:16:24.878 --> 01:16:26.664
And remember the rule.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.666
You're gonna see me again.

01:18:13.518 --> 01:18:15.156
All right, this is it.

01:18:15.219 --> 01:18:17.710
- This is what?
- This is our trench.

01:18:18.222 --> 01:18:19.917
Where?

01:18:20.525 --> 01:18:22.481
- Right here.
- Here?

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.881
String out.
Tudor, Crader, let's go!

01:18:50.554 --> 01:18:54.138
- Shit. You got any matches?
- I gave them all to you.

01:18:54.491 --> 01:18:55.435
What?

01:18:55.492 --> 01:18:58.131
- I gave them all to you.
- Yeah, but don't you have like a reserve?

01:18:58.195 --> 01:19:00.186
Well, they're reserve matches.

01:19:00.831 --> 01:19:02.719
- Those will do.
- Okay.

01:19:05.068 --> 01:19:07.559
Uh, they're wet too, though.

01:19:09.639 --> 01:19:13.985
I just don't understand you can say you don't like Sudbury
when you've never even been there.

01:19:14.044 --> 01:19:17.787
I don't have to go there.
I'm a Skin. Skins just know.

01:19:17.848 --> 01:19:21.545
Fuck you and the stolen horse you rode in on.

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:48.365
Oh! Goddamnit!

01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:50.993
Fuck!

01:19:52.381 --> 01:19:55.456
- This is insane!
- Yeah.

01:19:55.518 --> 01:19:58.305
- It's what you signed up for.
- No. Sir.

01:19:58.787 --> 01:20:01.028
Wrong.
I signed up to kill Germans.

01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:05.390
No, you didn't.
You signed up to kill your father.

01:20:07.062 --> 01:20:12.056
Hey, I've been carrying this around since Calgary.
Your sister wanted me to give it to you.

01:20:20.308 --> 01:20:22.299
What the hell's wrong with me?

01:20:25.813 --> 01:20:28.134
I haven't even written her.

01:20:29.817 --> 01:20:31.808
And my own sister?

01:20:31.853 --> 01:20:35.471
What if something happened to me?
How would I atone for that?

01:20:35.557 --> 01:20:40.381
If that's what you're looking for,
you've really come to the wrong place.

01:20:40.728 --> 01:20:43.265
- How can you say that?
- Come on, David. Look around you.

01:20:43.331 --> 01:20:45.572
You see any poets in this shit?

01:20:45.633 --> 01:20:49.546
We're all in a slaughter yard and there isn't
a single guy here who knows why.

01:20:49.604 --> 01:20:53.096
No. No. You wouldn't be here
if you believed that.

01:20:54.976 --> 01:20:57.661
I'm only here because of your sister.

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.566
Listen to me...

01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:07.991
Forests burn 'cause they have to; and oceans,
they go up and down 'cause they have to.

01:21:08.055 --> 01:21:09.773
I don't think we're that different.

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:12.462
If you want to get through this,
you gotta start seeing it for what it is;

01:21:12.526 --> 01:21:16.098
it's something we do all the time
'cause we're good at it;

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:19.781
and we're good at it
'cause we're used to it;

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:23.826
and we're used to it
'cause we do it all the time.

01:21:29.743 --> 01:21:32.189
You better hang on to something.

01:21:32.779 --> 01:21:35.065
The guns are coming.

01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:45.190
- Everyone synchronized?
- Yes, sir.

01:21:45.892 --> 01:21:48.383
Our assault starts... now.

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.948
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:21:53.591 --> 01:21:55.525
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.617
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:22:07.779 --> 01:22:10.767
Bore 800!

01:22:17.515 --> 01:22:19.725
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:22:23.262 --> 01:22:26.709
Forward posts reporting:
7th and Devils in No Man's Land, sir.

01:22:26.766 --> 01:22:28.654
Fifty yards, light resistance.

01:22:28.701 --> 01:22:30.566
German counter-attack reported, sir.

01:22:30.636 --> 01:22:35.300
Get me Division Headquarters. I want to know
if they've heard anything further--

01:22:38.703 --> 01:22:41.622
- Make sure the lines are okay.
- Is everyone all right?

01:22:41.679 --> 01:22:43.665
Light?
Somebody bring me a light.

01:22:54.392 --> 01:22:56.769
Câlisse! Fucking mud, eh!

01:23:00.498 --> 01:23:02.238
We got a real problem.

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:04.291
- No matches?
- Oui.

01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:08.883
How does it look, you think?
Are we going in?

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:11.864
I don't know.
It's too early to tell.

01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:13.219
Keep your head down, kid.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.199
Oh, shit. Fuck.

01:23:22.288 --> 01:23:24.248
- Field dressing!
- Fire crew!

01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:26.570
- Mr. Watchman.
- Where's the fire crew!

01:23:27.091 --> 01:23:28.877
- Stretcher!
- One second, sir.

01:23:30.227 --> 01:23:34.049
Dobson-Hughes,
you're acting 2IC eyes here.

01:23:34.199 --> 01:23:35.801
Eyes here!

01:23:41.071 --> 01:23:44.814
Come here. It's all right.
It's all right. You're okay.

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:48.936
Objectives consolidated, both flanks.
Field of fire 200 yards.

01:23:49.012 --> 01:23:52.397
- Venture and Vindictive have fallen.
- So far so good.

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:55.743
So far so good?

01:23:57.187 --> 01:23:59.269
So far so good, yeah?

01:23:59.723 --> 01:24:01.714
We'll get you out of here soon.

01:24:07.831 --> 01:24:09.617
You're okay.

01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:11.031
Okay.

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.131
- You're alright?
- Yeah.

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.424
Okay.

01:24:24.147 --> 01:24:29.130
Flare sighted, S.O.S.
Devil's left flank under counter-attack, sir.

01:24:29.152 --> 01:24:31.234
Get me 8th Battalion.

01:24:32.855 --> 01:24:34.743
Line's down, sir.

01:24:41.764 --> 01:24:44.050
- Something's wrong.
- What?

01:24:46.302 --> 01:24:49.578
Second flare sighted.
Left flank, 8th.

01:24:50.206 --> 01:24:54.540
Third S.O.S. flare sighted, left flank.
The 8th is taking a beating, sir.

01:24:54.964 --> 01:24:56.465
- Is your company ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:59.513
All right, Major.
In you go. Give 'em hell.

01:25:03.685 --> 01:25:06.301
There's a runner headed this way.

01:25:06.755 --> 01:25:09.747
Shit. All right, this is it, boys!
We're going in!

01:25:10.292 --> 01:25:12.078
Check your gear!

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:16.276
You don't need this,
and you don't need this,

01:25:17.933 --> 01:25:20.436
and you don't need this coat.

01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:23.376
Where are you going?

01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:25.076
Don't leave me.

01:25:25.807 --> 01:25:28.071
Jesus, please, don't leave me.

01:25:30.912 --> 01:25:33.627
It's okay. I'm right here.

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:38.969
The Devils are being hammered, sir.
There's a crack in the line.

01:25:46.194 --> 01:25:47.786
Reload!

01:25:48.697 --> 01:25:51.393
Goddamnit!
Where's the fucking relief?!

01:25:57.738 --> 01:26:01.720
If you can get past the mud,
the country's quite beautiful, no?

01:26:01.775 --> 01:26:04.573
Would you kindly shut up?

01:26:04.612 --> 01:26:07.558
- Hey, is that a hawk?
- No, it's a kestrel.

01:26:07.615 --> 01:26:11.619
- What the hell's a kestrel?
- It's a hawk.

01:26:14.855 --> 01:26:16.937
We need some relief!

01:26:25.666 --> 01:26:28.453
- They're coming!
- Here comes the relief!

01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:31.761
It's here!
Relief's here!

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:35.397
It's coming, boy!
It's coming!

01:26:36.243 --> 01:26:40.292
- Company commander. Where is he?
- Dead. All dead. Everyone with a stripe is down.

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.824
Where the hell are you going?

01:26:41.881 --> 01:26:44.406
I've had the shit kicked out of me
for 8 straight hours, sir!

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:48.147
- You won't leave this position!
- Sorry.

01:26:48.301 --> 01:26:51.632
Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on!
You can't leave us strung out here!

01:26:51.691 --> 01:26:53.830
You're 800.
We're just a company, 60 guys.

01:26:53.893 --> 01:26:56.817
You want me to stay,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

01:26:56.863 --> 01:26:58.649
Beat it!

01:27:02.902 --> 01:27:06.360
- Where are you going?
- What the hell's going on?

01:27:06.802 --> 01:27:10.082
- Don't leave!
- Get back here!

01:27:10.176 --> 01:27:13.623
H.Q. Little Black Devils pulling out.
Situation critical.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.568
Stress. Critical.

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.586
- The Alleymen are regrouping.
- I see them.

01:27:37.803 --> 01:27:42.160
- They're gonna counterattack.
- We don't have enough guys! Fuck!

01:27:52.617 --> 01:27:54.517
We got what we got.

01:27:54.586 --> 01:27:57.635
Two to a crater!
Horne, Miles, to my right!

01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:59.475
- Lewis gunners on the flanks!
- Let's move.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.234
- Go! Go!
- Two down there.

01:28:06.465 --> 01:28:08.760
- Get her down. Get her down.
- Let's go!

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.710
- Nothing from 'A' Company?
- Still down, sir.

01:28:10.769 --> 01:28:13.181
Third Brigade is stalled.
Fusiliers are being routed.

01:28:13.238 --> 01:28:14.478
Rout them all to hell.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:17.177
Black Devils have pulled out.
Our flank will be open, sir.

01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:19.067
And our whole fucking line will collapse.

01:28:19.141 --> 01:28:21.967
- Follow me, I want to talk to the Devils.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:43.391 --> 01:28:44.318
Hey.

01:28:46.537 --> 01:28:50.428
- Enemy target marker!
- Hold it!

01:28:51.008 --> 01:28:52.896
That's a second marker!

01:28:55.778 --> 01:28:56.846
Hey.

01:29:02.153 --> 01:29:03.541
Thanks.

01:29:03.954 --> 01:29:06.046
Bring on the hell.

01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:08.508
Here come the guns!

01:29:27.243 --> 01:29:29.438
- What are you doing?
- My gun's stuck! Fuck!

01:29:33.049 --> 01:29:34.539
Horne?

01:29:34.951 --> 01:29:35.494
Christ!

01:29:49.099 --> 01:29:50.635
Steady! Hold it!

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.486
Hold it!

01:30:01.043 --> 01:30:02.429
Can't shoot me.

01:30:07.449 --> 01:30:09.685
- Too fucking many of them!
- Hold it!

01:30:09.751 --> 01:30:13.336
- They're awfully close, Sergeant.
- Steady!

01:30:13.616 --> 01:30:14.866
Mon tabernac!

01:30:18.329 --> 01:30:20.080
Steady! Steady!

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:22.582
You fuck, fucking, fuckers...

01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:24.209
Come on, come on...

01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:29.860
Come on, come on...

01:30:30.305 --> 01:30:31.795
Now!

01:31:04.374 --> 01:31:05.917
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:31:07.642 --> 01:31:09.837
They're fucking on top of us!

01:31:13.366 --> 01:31:15.177
Hey, we're up! We're up!

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:17.387
Allez, allez, allez!

01:31:23.491 --> 01:31:25.834
I sent you a support company,
sixty men.

01:31:25.893 --> 01:31:29.090
You pulled out a whole fucking battalion?
Jesus Christ!

01:31:30.697 --> 01:31:32.437
Sir. Sixty men? It's impossible.

01:31:32.465 --> 01:31:34.558
They'll be overrun.
Then we'll be overrun.

01:31:34.634 --> 01:31:37.523
- We have to withdraw!
- We don't withdraw a fucking inch!

01:31:37.571 --> 01:31:40.745
We don't give ground, we don't lose an objective
and we don't give up a single gun!

01:31:40.807 --> 01:31:45.585
But, Colonel, if the enemy breaks through,
we'll be in danger!

01:31:50.283 --> 01:31:53.923
Lieutenant Hanson, you're acting 2IC.
Let`s go!

01:31:58.425 --> 01:32:00.120
Here we go.

01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:37.843
Come on!

01:33:24.776 --> 01:33:26.676
Goddamnit! The whole battalion!

01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:29.811
<i>- When do you want this for, sir?</i>
- Now!!

01:33:29.846 --> 01:33:32.644
Every last one of them!
Get them in there now!

01:33:33.524 --> 01:33:35.934
All eyes here!
They're piling up out there,

01:33:36.018 --> 01:33:39.923
so all personnel not immediately engaged
report outside for triage.

01:33:59.743 --> 01:34:01.233
Shoot!

01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:03.345
Goddamnit!

01:34:08.085 --> 01:34:10.576
Shoot the goddamn rifle!

01:34:21.405 --> 01:34:22.748
Form up!

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:25.825
Form up! Let's move!

01:34:27.170 --> 01:34:29.565
Hold the line!
Hold that line!

01:34:35.479 --> 01:34:37.800
They're turning.
Up and down the line.

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:39.485
Yeah, they'll be back.
Load up.

01:34:39.683 --> 01:34:42.578
Reload! Reload!

01:34:43.393 --> 01:34:44.344
Reload!

01:35:00.136 --> 01:35:02.127
- Sound off! Miles?
- Dead.

01:35:02.338 --> 01:35:03.874
- Cahill?
- Dead.

01:35:03.939 --> 01:35:06.134
- Horne?
- Really dead.

01:35:06.976 --> 01:35:08.568
Mann?

01:35:11.747 --> 01:35:13.533
David Mann?

01:35:22.358 --> 01:35:24.303
David Mann?

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.203
- Nein, nein.
- Deutsch?

01:35:30.399 --> 01:35:31.888
Artillerie!

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:45.947
Jeez...

01:36:00.829 --> 01:36:02.421
What are you doing, Mikey?

01:36:07.836 --> 01:36:09.724
- Cover fire!
- Covering fire!

01:37:43.036 --> 01:37:44.724
It`s so quiet.

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.396
Come on. Come on.

01:41:19.281 --> 01:41:21.908
Get your asses moving!

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:27.098
- Set him down.
- Set him down.

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:30.564
You're okay.
You made it. You're okay.

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:31.845
Hey, they're forming up!

01:41:32.787 --> 01:41:34.698
- Give me some morphine.
- Can't get any fucking relief?

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:36.871
Sarge, here.
You need some water.

01:41:36.957 --> 01:41:38.091
Anybody got ammunition?

01:41:38.133 --> 01:41:39.539
- I'm out.
- Spent.

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:41.333
Ah, here they come again!

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:43.101
- We need some relief!
- Damn it!

01:41:43.164 --> 01:41:45.428
- 8th Battalion! They're here!
- Here comes the relief!

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:47.969
The whole goddamn battalion's here!

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:51.148
Stretcher-bearers!
Both these men!

01:42:13.726 --> 01:42:16.172
Battalion's in line, sir,
and the line is holding.

01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:17.867
Objectives are secure.

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:20.092
Aid posts reporting still more wounded en route,

01:42:20.166 --> 01:42:21.952
so let's make room for 'em.

01:42:22.368 --> 01:42:26.134
We did it, by the way.
We took Passchendaele.

01:42:53.332 --> 01:42:55.323
Nurse, I need an assessment over there.

01:43:07.145 --> 01:43:09.033
He's okay.

01:43:09.748 --> 01:43:11.636
David's okay.

01:43:15.354 --> 01:43:17.140
Look at you...

01:43:18.624 --> 01:43:21.411
Yeah, look at me,
all broken up like this.

01:43:25.264 --> 01:43:28.119
I think maybe you're forgetting the rule.

01:43:30.869 --> 01:43:33.611
No, I'm just trying to finish that picture.

01:43:33.672 --> 01:43:37.311
But I don't think I'm all that good
at these pictures, so...

01:43:39.710 --> 01:43:42.816
maybe, maybe this man
could just write to her?

01:43:44.515 --> 01:43:45.857
And will he?

01:43:45.917 --> 01:43:47.612
Yes, Sarah. He will.

01:43:49.921 --> 01:43:52.901
He'll sit at this little table...

01:43:53.557 --> 01:43:55.878
and what he'll write is...

01:43:57.595 --> 01:43:59.734
"In this picture, there is a river

01:44:00.464 --> 01:44:02.250
and there is a horse,

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.192
and there is a man sitting that horse;

01:44:06.771 --> 01:44:09.262
and together they ford that river."

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.674
And all these things are in the Foothills.

01:44:20.885 --> 01:44:23.445
I think you're forgetting the rule.

01:44:25.689 --> 01:44:29.386
- No, I'm gonna cross that river.
- Michael, don't...

01:44:30.927 --> 01:44:32.815
'Cause I have you...

01:44:39.869 --> 01:44:41.757
Mike...

01:47:21.059 --> 01:47:24.145
<i>After the guns are silent</i>

01:47:25.647 --> 01:47:29.150
<i>After your wounds have healed</i>

01:47:30.652 --> 01:47:34.655
<i>After those crosses</i>

01:47:34.698 --> 01:47:38.159
<i>Have been planted in all those fields</i>

01:47:40.078 --> 01:47:44.415
<i>After that long boat ride</i>

01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:48.419
<i>All the way across the sea</i>

01:47:49.337 --> 01:47:53.007
<i>And after this train</i>

01:47:53.049 --> 01:47:55.509
<i>Carries me</i>

01:47:59.014 --> 01:48:02.558
<i>I will love you</i>

01:48:04.728 --> 01:48:08.314
<i>After the war</i>

01:48:08.356 --> 01:48:10.274
<i>Love you</i>

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:12.234
<i>For always</i>

01:48:13.737 --> 01:48:16.405
<i>Forever more</i>

01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:21.410
<i>I will love you</i>

01:48:23.747 --> 01:48:27.291
<i>After the war</i>

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:29.793
<i>Forever</i>

01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:31.712
<i>For always</i>

01:48:31.755 --> 01:48:33.923
<i>And more</i>

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:45.809
<i>After your boots dry</i>

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:47.686
<i>And the tobacco's</i>

01:48:47.729 --> 01:48:51.398
<i>All but gone</i>

01:48:51.441 --> 01:48:55.778
<i>Along with all those postcards</i>

01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:57.905
<i>You've carried</i>

01:48:57.948 --> 01:49:00.908
<i>Under your arm</i>

01:49:00.951 --> 01:49:05.287
<i>After I remember</i>

01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:09.375
<i>All the words I couldn't say</i>

01:49:10.418 --> 01:49:14.255
<i>And after this long night</i>

01:49:14.297 --> 01:49:16.882
<i>Fades away</i>

01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:23.389
<i>I will love you</i>

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:28.852
<i>After the war</i>

01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:31.564
<i>I love you</i>

01:49:31.606 --> 01:49:34.567
<i>For always</i>

01:49:34.609 --> 01:49:37.152
<i>Forever more</i>

01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:42.741
<i>I will love you</i>

01:49:44.786 --> 01:49:48.289
<i>After the war</i>

01:49:48.331 --> 01:49:50.249
<i>Forever</i>

01:49:50.292 --> 01:49:52.876
<i>For always</i>

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:55.921
<i>And more</i>

01:50:02.637 --> 01:50:06.432
<i>After this blackbird</i>

01:50:06.474 --> 01:50:08.267
<i>Lifts up</i>

01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:10.811
<i>From off your chest</i>

01:50:12.063 --> 01:50:15.733
<i>And after your soul</i>

01:50:15.775 --> 01:50:20.779
<i>Takes its final rest</i>

01:50:21.406 --> 01:50:25.242
<i>My love, I forgive you</i>

01:50:26.745 --> 01:50:30.998
<i>You never planned to die</i>

01:50:31.041 --> 01:50:35.294
<i>And love, I'll place two pennies</i>

01:50:35.337 --> 01:50:37.504
<i>Over your eyes</i>

01:50:43.261 --> 01:50:46.722
<i>I will love you</i>

01:50:48.892 --> 01:50:51.685

<i>Forever more</i>

01:51:02.113 --> 01:51:05.783
<i>I will love you</i>

01:51:07.952 --> 01:51:11.288
