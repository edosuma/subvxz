Oh, i am too amped

and a dragon?

00:52.486 --> 00:53.385

Are there naked chicks?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.520
Oh, tons, bro.

00:54.522 --> 00:55.521
Why do you think
he watches it?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.222
It's a historical drama.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.491
- It's medieval tits and ass.
- Middle earth porn.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.326
Middle earth porn?
Okay, i haven't done that.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.662
But i'm not gonna see
naked midgets or anything, am i?

At the very beginning
of the band, they agreed,

01:46.707 --> 01:48.774

would split everything--

01:48.776 --> 01:50.609

He's so boring sometimes.

Yeah, you know why
he's so boring?

That's what the problem is.

If you were going out
with ron wood,

I would be, like,

- Yeah.

slept with flash yet?

- Uh, no.
- Okay.

- I don't want to know that.

Oh, but you ask her
if she's slept with him?

04:14.588 --> 04:16.054
- That's different.
- What the hell?

04:16.056 --> 04:17.356
- How?
- Because i'm your father.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.690
I think i have
the right to know

04:18.692 --> 04:20.359
If you're sleeping
with somebody,

04:20.361 --> 04:21.893
And that's a normal thing
for a father to ask.

Okay, honey, let me clue
you in on this, okay?

- She's on the verge.
- No, she's not.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.898
- Yes, she is.
- She's just--you know--

04:26.900 --> 04:28.033
I'm just going
down on him?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.568
Please don't say that, okay?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.436
Which is different--
it doesn't really count.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.071
- Oh, and how is that different?
- It doesn't count.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.573
What do you mean
it doesn't count?

04:34.575 --> 04:36.041
- How does it not count?
- Since when did it count?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.609
Like, since
the beginning of time.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.077
From a woman's
point of view,

04:39.079 --> 04:41.046
Basically since eve
has been blowing adam.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.914
Oh, really? Okay.
I think you forget, honey--

04:42.916 --> 04:44.783
I went 12 years
at catholic school.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.452
I don't remember anything about
blow jobs in the bible, okay?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.388
Okay, well, do you remember
they were together

04:49.390 --> 04:50.389
For, like, 900 years?

04:50.391 --> 04:51.590
Yes, i do.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.058
Yeah, that's a lot
of blow jobs.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.060
Okay, will you please
stop saying that, okay?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.962
I'm sorry.
Listen, you brought it up.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.897
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, i--

04:58.899 --> 05:01.099
- I go down on a guy--
- i don't want--

05:01.101 --> 05:02.567
I said--
i changed the words!

05:02.569 --> 05:04.102
I go down on a guy i like

05:04.104 --> 05:06.138
To decide whether or not
i want to sleep with him.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.440
Like, i'll do it, like,
two or three times

05:08.442 --> 05:11.243
To keep him interested,
and, you know--

05:11.245 --> 05:12.411
It's my system.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.745
Okay--you have a system?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.614
Yeah, of course i do.
Every girl does.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.249
Really? 'cause ava
didn't have a system.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.650
That must be
a generational thing.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.085
Uh, do you remember
when we first met?

05:20.087 --> 05:21.420
Yes, i do.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.288
Okay, how many blow jobs
did i give you

05:23.290 --> 05:27.592
Before you were begging me
to be your girlfriend?

05:27.594 --> 05:29.261
Just that one,
that first night.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.762
Oh, yeah.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.964
Oh, you must be
really good.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.599
Oh, hall of fame, kid.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.268
Hey, i can suck the stripes
off a candy cane.

05:36.270 --> 05:37.669
Okay, she doesn't need
to know that.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.438
I will teach you things
that will make flash

05:39.440 --> 05:40.672
Go weak in the knees.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.274
You have to tell me.
You see, dad,

05:42.276 --> 05:44.443
I could never talk to my real
mom about stuff like this.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.012
(johnny)
you're not supposed to talk to
your mom about stuff like that.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.313
I do this thing where
i tickle the taint.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.948
- You tickle the taint!
- Don't tell her

05:49.950 --> 05:51.149
- About the taint!
- Fascinating. Taint!

05:51.151 --> 05:52.384
- Telling her about the taint!
- Taint!

05:54.321 --> 05:57.289
Oh, my god.
Who is that?

05:57.291 --> 05:59.124
Holy shit,
he's gorgeous.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.360
Yes, he is.
It's jim.

06:01.362 --> 06:04.463
The singer/songwriter from
the two-man band jim and mike.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.464
I just signed them.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.832
They have more heat on them

06:06.834 --> 06:08.300
Than the heathens had
back in your heyday.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.202
- Yeah, can he sing?
- Who cares?

06:10.204 --> 06:11.470
Look at him.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.038
He's so suburban.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.173
Well, jim is a leader
in the "norm-core" movement.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.976
It's purposely dressing like
you're on the way to the mall.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.344
So jim's kind of like
a trendsetter,

06:19.346 --> 06:20.879
Like i was
back in the day?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.481
Yeah, but hopefully
he won't be wearing

06:22.483 --> 06:24.149
The exact same outfit
two decades from now.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.717
Honey, this is
my look, okay?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.653
No, no, this is axl rose's
look from 1987.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.322
[laughs]

06:30.324 --> 06:32.057
I think he looks
pretty douche-y.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.227
Well, looking douche-y is
the new not looking douche-y.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.895
Why can't she go out
with a guy like this,

06:36.897 --> 06:38.730
Her own age, instead of flash?
I don't get it.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.165
Well, because
you're a moron.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.500
What do you mean?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.535
She's 21, right?
You're her old man.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.736
Yeah.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.171
What did you do
when you were her age

06:46.173 --> 06:48.240
And your mom wanted you
to become billy joel?

06:48.242 --> 06:50.041
I said,
"[...] billy joel."

06:50.043 --> 06:51.843
Exactly.
That's reverse psychology.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.044
She's all over flash

06:53.046 --> 06:54.713
Because from the day
she first showed up,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.848
The last guy you wanted
her to sleep with was him.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.084
This is basic parenting 101,
john.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.253
I mean, steve the monkey
could google this shit.

07:01.255 --> 07:05.190
I wanted my daughter
to marry a jewish guy.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.358
You know what i told her?

07:06.360 --> 07:07.559
"don't marry a jew?"

07:07.561 --> 07:10.429
Now i have a son-in-law
named "noah."
