00:08.442 --> 00:09.575
- ¶

00:09.577 --> 00:11.143
- ALL: [laughing]

00:11.145 --> 00:13.545
- Are you guys watching
that video of Max eating

00:13.547 --> 00:14.413
that spicy hot wing?

00:14.415 --> 00:17.249
- No, because that
video is not funny.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.120
- Ah, sure it is.

00:21.122 --> 00:25.190
You were all like, "Ah,
my tongue is melting."

00:25.192 --> 00:27.960
- Actually, we're watching
this viral video

00:27.962 --> 00:29.061
of a wimpy survivalist

00:29.063 --> 00:31.263
who totally freaks out
over nothing.

00:31.265 --> 00:31.764
- Yeah.

00:31.766 --> 00:34.533
- MAN: The number-one rule
to surviving in the wild is--

00:34.535 --> 00:36.268
- [owl hooting]

00:36.270 --> 00:37.603
- MAN: I want my mommy!

00:37.605 --> 00:39.671
- ALL: [laughing]

00:39.673 --> 00:42.441
- He calls his mom mommy, Mommy.

00:44.678 --> 00:48.247
- What kind of loser can't
handle one night in the wild?

00:48.249 --> 00:48.714
- Ha-ha!

00:48.716 --> 00:51.750
- It's easy to judge someone
from the comfort of your sofa.

00:51.752 --> 00:56.021
- Barb, survival is in
the Thunderman blood!

00:56.023 --> 00:58.290
- Please.
Max wouldn't last five minutes

00:58.292 --> 01:00.626
in the wilderness
without his hairdryer.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.295
- I don't have to.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.030
I'm my own hairdryer.

01:05.032 --> 01:06.632
Ahh-ahh!

01:06.634 --> 01:08.133
[sizzling]

01:08.135 --> 01:09.435
- You're smoking, Max.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.536
- Thank you, Chloe.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.505
- No, no, no, your hair
is actually smoking.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.440
- Ah, ah!

01:14.442 --> 01:17.009
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Ah, ah!

01:17.011 --> 01:19.078
Freeze spray, freeze spray!

01:19.080 --> 01:22.481
- See? Less outdoorsy,
more indoor-sy.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.449
- Less camping, more glamping.

01:23.451 --> 01:27.786
- Yeah, less tough, more...you
could never survive in the wild.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.558
- Did you--did they---about us?

01:32.560 --> 01:34.193
- Uh.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.228
Son, I will handle this.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.565
Did you--did they--about us?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.066
- Look, there's no shame in it.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.435
It's just who you guys are.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.069
- Oh, okay.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.705
Thunder Men, we need
to prove them wrong.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.674
Tomorrow night,
the great outdoors

01:48.676 --> 01:51.810
becomes the great our doors.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.512
[laughs]

01:54.348 --> 01:57.349
I mean, we're going camping.

01:58.552 --> 02:01.587
- ¶

02:01.589 --> 02:02.287
- [phone beeping]

02:02.289 --> 02:04.756
- BOTH: [screams]
Did you see this? What?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.291
You go! I'll go!

02:06.293 --> 02:07.359
You go!

02:07.361 --> 02:09.361
- Okay. I'll go.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.396
They're dropping all 12 episodes
of the new season

02:11.398 --> 02:12.798
of "Best Chefs Forever" tonight!

02:12.800 --> 02:13.499
- [screams]

02:13.501 --> 02:17.636
This means the chefs survive
the exploding the pork roast.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.139
- You and I have to stay up
all night and watch

02:20.141 --> 02:22.441
the entire season so that nobody
spoils it for us

02:22.443 --> 02:24.076
at school on Monday.

02:24.078 --> 02:24.676
- Girls!

02:24.678 --> 02:28.080
I had a totally brills idea!

02:29.216 --> 02:34.386
- Mom, I thought we talked about
you using words like "brills."

02:34.388 --> 02:37.089
- Sorry, I'm just super jazzed!

02:37.091 --> 02:39.491
- Add jazzed to the list.
- Yeah.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.460
- Okay, since the boys
are going camping,

02:41.462 --> 02:48.634
I planned an old-fashion
McBooger girls' night! What?

02:48.636 --> 02:49.334
- BOTH: Tonight?

02:49.336 --> 02:52.738
- It's finally time to introduce
Chloe to all the fun traditions

02:52.740 --> 02:56.108
we McBoogers had
down on the family farm.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.843
[gasps] Hit it, Chloe!

02:57.845 --> 03:00.479
- Mom, needs
some cowbell, baby!

03:00.481 --> 03:05.384
- [cowbell ringing]

03:07.821 --> 03:08.654
- What are we gonna do?

03:08.656 --> 03:10.689
- If we don't watch
every single episode tonight,

03:10.691 --> 03:13.292
it'll get spoiled,
and our lives will be over.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.494
- I know. One of us is gonna
have to tell Mom

03:15.496 --> 03:17.462
we already have plans.
- BOTH: You tell her!

03:17.464 --> 03:19.565
No, you tell her! You tell her!

03:19.567 --> 03:20.566
- [laughing]

03:20.568 --> 03:23.902
Oh, there's nothing I would want
more in this world

03:23.904 --> 03:26.305
then one night with my girls.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.873
Or maybe a pig or two.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.442
Soiee!

03:30.444 --> 03:32.311
- [cowbell ringing]

03:32.313 --> 03:34.179
- ¶

03:34.181 --> 03:35.514
- Mosquito net?
- Check!

03:35.516 --> 03:36.448
- Sleeping bags?
- Check!

03:36.450 --> 03:38.850
- Prove to the girls that
we have survival skills?

03:38.852 --> 03:41.353
- Oooh, that's a big check!

03:41.355 --> 03:42.454
- Yeah!

03:42.456 --> 03:45.390
How dare they say
we're not outdoorsy?

03:45.392 --> 03:48.727
- Yeah! We're outdoors
right now.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.264
- Help me with my bag, Dad.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.299
- Oooh!
What is in this thing?

03:54.301 --> 03:56.602
Feels like you're carrying
a ton of rocks.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.603
- I am.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.937
Whoa!

04:00.407 --> 04:03.775
- Well, I've managed to pack
all my survival looks

04:03.777 --> 04:06.178
into only eight bags.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.580
- Hold up, Colosso,
you're not coming.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.949
- A bunny can't survive
in nature.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.552
- Where do you think
bunnies are from?

04:13.554 --> 04:15.387
- France.

04:16.323 --> 04:21.526
- Sorry, Colosso, but this trip
is for the Thunder men only.

04:21.528 --> 04:22.761
You understand, right?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.496
- Uh, yeah, totally.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.298
Uh, I was joking.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.600
These suitcases are empty.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.535
- [boing]
- Ah!

04:31.338 --> 04:34.239
Uh, this is all
still part of the joke.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.674
[nervous laugh]

04:35.676 --> 04:37.943
So are these tears.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.446
- Time to go.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.514
Grab ahold, boys.

04:42.516 --> 04:46.351
Thunder men, off to survive!

04:46.353 --> 04:47.786
- ¶

04:49.657 --> 04:53.759
- Thunder men,
we barely survived!

04:53.761 --> 04:55.894
- The bats were in my hair!

04:55.896 --> 04:57.629
My hair!

04:58.265 --> 05:00.365
- And those squirrels
stole my jerky!

05:00.367 --> 05:02.234
My jerky!

05:02.403 --> 05:06.405
- Then I saw that scary
Sasquatch bathing in the river.

05:07.408 --> 05:11.677
- Yes, that was a Sasquatch.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.879
Uh, I guess we better
tell the girls they were right

05:13.881 --> 05:16.815
about us not being able
to survive outdoors.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.417
- Dad, we can't tell them that!

05:18.419 --> 05:19.584
We'll never hear the end of it!

05:19.586 --> 05:21.887
Let's just sneak
into my lair, hide out,

05:21.889 --> 05:27.459
and return in the morning
after a night full of "nature."

05:27.461 --> 05:29.928
- No, I'm not gonna
lie to your mom.

05:29.930 --> 05:30.829
- Me neither.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.897
- We can order pizza.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.498
- BOTH: We're in!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.834
- ¶

05:35.836 --> 05:38.704
¶ What you see
is not what you get ¶

05:38.706 --> 05:41.807
¶ Living our lives
with a secret ¶

05:41.809 --> 05:44.776
¶ We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess ¶

05:44.778 --> 05:48.347
¶ Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest ¶

05:48.349 --> 05:51.883
¶ A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be ¶

05:51.885 --> 05:55.587
¶ But closer you might see
the crazy things we do ¶

05:55.589 --> 05:57.356
¶ This isn't make-believe ¶

05:57.358 --> 05:58.423
¶ It's our reality ¶

05:58.425 --> 06:01.660
¶ Just your average family
trying to be normal ¶

06:01.662 --> 06:03.495
¶ And stay out of trouble ¶

06:03.497 --> 06:07.632

06:10.838 --> 06:13.772
- [owl hooting]

06:13.774 --> 06:15.607
- MAN: I want my mommy!

06:15.609 --> 06:16.775
- [laughing]

06:16.777 --> 06:17.876
- What a loser!

06:17.878 --> 06:20.011
- Oh, can't handle the wild.

06:20.013 --> 06:20.812
Pathetic.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.247
- [knocking at door]
- Ah!

06:22.249 --> 06:24.816
It was all Max's idea, Barb!

06:26.053 --> 06:27.786
- It's just the pizza.

06:27.788 --> 06:28.987
- I know it's the pizza.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.923
[whispers] I did not know
it was the pizza.

06:34.128 --> 06:38.263
- Sorry, I'd give you a tip,
but I'm camping.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.067
Okay, guys, before we eat,
need to cover our tracks

06:42.069 --> 06:44.703
and send the girls proof
that we're in the wild.

06:44.705 --> 06:49.107
- Ooh, you can't
make me go back there!

06:49.109 --> 06:49.674
- Relax.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.310
All we have to do is
stage a photo of us camping.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.012
Dad, remember
that picture I sent you

06:54.014 --> 06:55.213
from the Statue of Liberty?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.114
- Remember it?

06:56.116 --> 06:59.885
I made a T-shirt out of it!

06:59.887 --> 07:02.220
- Well, there's
something you should know.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.123
- [machine buzzing]

07:06.960 --> 07:10.362
- [gasps]
I've been wearing a lie.

07:11.832 --> 07:15.200
- Does this mean you weren't
at the running of the bulls?

07:15.202 --> 07:17.903
- [machine buzzes]

07:19.139 --> 07:21.440
- Max, watch out!

07:21.975 --> 07:25.410
- As your father,
I am very disappointed!

07:25.412 --> 07:30.348
But as a partner in a lie,
I say, take us to the forest.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.452
- [machine beeps]

07:34.188 --> 07:36.054
- Say, "Surviving!"

07:36.056 --> 07:37.823
- ALL: Surviving!

07:37.825 --> 07:40.258
- [camera clicks]

07:40.260 --> 07:41.993
- Howdy-do!

07:41.995 --> 07:46.264
Gather round, farm girls, and
let's get in the McBooger spirit

07:46.266 --> 07:47.933
with some hay facials,

07:47.935 --> 07:50.936
a little jug band music.
- [guitar plays]

07:50.938 --> 07:51.403
- And...

07:51.405 --> 07:54.172
- Please say watching
"Best Chefs Forever."

07:54.174 --> 07:58.009
- Pin the tail on the alpaca!

07:59.880 --> 08:00.779
- What's an alpaca?

08:00.781 --> 08:04.950
- Oh, uh, it's kinda like
a fluffy dog that spits.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.252
- Mom's family raised alpacas
on their farm.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.255
- Not to brag, but we were
the most respected

08:10.257 --> 08:13.091
alpaca breeders
in the tristate area.

08:13.093 --> 08:17.295
- Were there many alpaca
breeders in the tristate area?

08:17.297 --> 08:19.297
- No, just us.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.201
- Howdy-do!

08:24.171 --> 08:27.372
Hey, got room
for one more farm girl?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.175
- Sorry, Colosso,
but this is reserved

08:30.177 --> 08:34.846
for McBooger girls only,
so get to hopping.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.215
- Uh, yeah, totally.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.884
[laughing] I was just joking.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.186
I didn't want to hang out
with you guys.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.387
[laughing]

08:42.389 --> 08:44.956
Another Colosso joke scores.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.758
[laughing]

08:49.396 --> 08:51.830
- I have an idea.
Follow my lead.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.467
Hey, Mom, why don't you
take the first hay mask?

08:55.469 --> 08:58.770
- Well, I did work my buns off
setting this thing up.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.804
- Yeah, you sure did.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.206
Now hit the hay.
- Oh!

09:01.208 --> 09:04.276
- And stay
as cool as a cucumber

09:04.278 --> 09:08.547
while you listen to
the calming sounds of the farm.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.382
- [rooster crowing]

09:10.384 --> 09:12.484
- Ah, isn't this nice?

09:12.486 --> 09:15.287
Just us McBooger gals bonding?

09:15.289 --> 09:17.455
- Yep.
- You said it.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.226
- Whatcha watching?
- Sssh.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.360
- Girls!

09:22.362 --> 09:24.062
No phones on the farm.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.031
Now, as we used to say
back home,

09:26.033 --> 09:29.301
alpaca these up for later.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.804
- Uh, "alpaca these
up for later."

09:32.806 --> 09:35.140
That's so funny, Mom.
Isn't that so funny, Nora?

09:35.142 --> 09:37.576
- That is so funny, Phoebe.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.644
- Okay, she's gone. Plan B.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.980
You keep Farmer Barb busy
while I go down to Max's lair

09:41.982 --> 09:43.315
and watch "Best Chefs Forever"
on his computer.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.550
- Wait, I don't get to watch
"Best Chefs Forever"?

09:45.552 --> 09:47.385
- I'll tell you what happens.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.920
Ow!

09:48.922 --> 09:50.956
Fine, we'll take turns.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.558
- This is what
it's all about, boys.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.094
Back to basics.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.264
[burps]

09:59.266 --> 10:01.032
- Nice!

10:01.935 --> 10:03.101
- You ever stop to think...

10:03.103 --> 10:07.238
a burp is like a memory
of the meal you just ate?

10:08.475 --> 10:11.376
- That's pretty deep, Billy.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.410
- COMPUTER: Alert, alert.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.145
Phoebe Thunderman approaching.

10:14.147 --> 10:18.416
- I didn't know
the Thunder Monitor had a baby.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.919
- No, it's a mini
Thunder Monitor to alert me

10:20.921 --> 10:21.753
every time Phoebe's coming.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.489
- It doesn't warn you when
we come down here, does it?

10:24.491 --> 10:26.891
- Uh...quick, hide!

10:31.498 --> 10:34.199
- Looks like Mom
turned this place into a pigsty,

10:34.201 --> 10:36.167
am I right?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.870
Oh, wait, I'm alone.

10:38.872 --> 10:42.907
And now, a recipe for friendship
with a dollop of intrigue

10:42.909 --> 10:46.277
and a dash of drama!

10:46.279 --> 10:47.312
[humming]

10:47.314 --> 10:50.115
¶ These girls know a bit
about a boilie base ¶

10:50.117 --> 10:53.318
¶ But they also know a thing
about cracking a case ¶

10:53.320 --> 10:58.990
¶ It's cooking time,
they're fighting crime ¶

10:58.992 --> 11:00.358
¶ Sticking together ¶

11:00.360 --> 11:03.995
¶ Boom, Best Chefs Forever ¶

11:03.997 --> 11:07.399
¶ Best Chefs Forever ¶

11:07.401 --> 11:11.069
¶ Oh, yeah ¶¶

11:13.440 --> 11:14.406
- ¶

11:14.408 --> 11:19.577
- Alright, well, who's ready
for a little jug band jamboree?

11:19.579 --> 11:20.412
- Me!
- Me.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.313
- Okay. You know,
back in the day,

11:22.315 --> 11:24.349
the McBooger barnyard band
was considered

11:24.351 --> 11:28.053
the most respected jug band
in the tristate area?

11:28.055 --> 11:31.923
- Were there many jug bands
in the tristate area?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.558
- No, just us.

11:34.628 --> 11:35.927
Hope Phoebe's okay.

11:35.929 --> 11:36.695
She's been gone awhile.

11:36.697 --> 11:40.398
- She better be back soon,
because it's my turn to...

11:40.400 --> 11:42.167
go to the outhouse.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.102
- Alright, go ahead,
tell Phoebe to hurry back.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.639
She is not gonna wanna miss me
jamming out on my spoons.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.574
Hit me with some cowbell, Chloe!

11:49.576 --> 11:53.011
- First I gotta
hit this dirt juice.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.615
Ah, that's farm fresh.

11:59.086 --> 11:59.517
- ¶

11:59.519 --> 12:01.419
- Brr, getting cold
just watching the chefs

12:01.421 --> 12:04.255
locked in that Little Tokyo
meat freezer.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.328
- NORA: [whispers] Phoebe.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.232
- [whispers] Get out of here.
This is my spot.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.434
- I'm in here.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.476
- Ahhh!
- Ah!

12:25.278 --> 12:26.010
Quick question.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.546
Have you ever tasted a glass
of goopy dirt juice?

12:28.548 --> 12:29.514
- Ew, no.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.349
- Well I have!

12:31.651 --> 12:34.319
Which means it's your turn
to McBooger sit.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.287
- But Chef Brielle
and Chef Brianne

12:36.289 --> 12:37.388
are about to cater
a ninja wedding.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.991
Just stay down here, and we'll
finish the episode together.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.326
- Okay. Give me the headphones.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.160
- Hey! They're mine.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.063
Go find Max's.
They're probably under his bed.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.270
- Ew!

12:52.272 --> 12:55.106
Feels like I touched
a rotten jack-o-lantern.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.677
Got 'em!

13:01.481 --> 13:02.447
- That was close.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.082
We're finally safe.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.483
- Hey, guys!
- Ah!

13:05.485 --> 13:08.586
- Colosso, you're not gonna
rat us out, are you?

13:08.588 --> 13:09.587
- I'm no rat.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.556
- We know. You're a bunny.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.592
What is wrong with this guy?

13:14.594 --> 13:15.627
- I'm here to help.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.428
Barb's coming down here.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.096
- She is?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.397
- Yeah. You better
hide in the slide

13:19.399 --> 13:22.033
so she doesn't find out
you aren't camping.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.034
Go now!

13:23.036 --> 13:25.069
Go, go, go!

13:25.705 --> 13:27.806
- BARB: Girls!
- COLOSSO: Hurry!

13:27.808 --> 13:29.808
[laughs]

13:32.212 --> 13:33.278
- [electricity zapping]

13:33.280 --> 13:34.612
- No!
- No!

13:34.614 --> 13:37.649
- I can't believe you two.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.150
- Mom, we can explain.

13:39.152 --> 13:39.784
- Explain what?

13:39.786 --> 13:42.053
That you pretended to go
to the outhouse so you could

13:42.055 --> 13:44.489
sneak down here
and avoid my girls' night?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.624
- Oh, so you're all caught up.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.326
- Well, don't worry.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.297
There will never be another
McBooger's girls' night.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.300
- Wait, Mom!

13:57.704 --> 14:00.638
- Oh, hold on a second.
They might come back.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.640
- Thanks for having
our backs, buddy.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.242
Wait, how did you know
Mom was coming?

14:04.244 --> 14:07.111
- Well, because I called her
down to get revenge on the girls

14:07.113 --> 14:09.280
for not including me
in their night.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.482
- Ha, that's funny.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.752
Wait, we left you
out of our night, too.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.221
- I know.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.455
Revenge!

14:17.457 --> 14:21.793
[evil laughing]

14:21.795 --> 14:23.328
- ¶

14:26.533 --> 14:27.966
- ¶

14:27.968 --> 14:28.967
- Colosso!

14:28.969 --> 14:31.502
Let us out of here, you traitor!

14:31.504 --> 14:32.270
- You can't yell!

14:32.272 --> 14:34.539
You have to sweet talk him.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.907
Hey, Colosso!

14:35.909 --> 14:39.110
Let us out,
you fashionable traitor.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.847
- You guys
are wasting your time.

14:42.849 --> 14:43.581
Nobody can hear us.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.950
- Well, then I'll have
to punch our way out!

14:45.952 --> 14:47.151
- Dad, no!
- [bang]

14:47.153 --> 14:49.520
- Ow!
- [loud ringing]

14:49.522 --> 14:50.521
- I tried to tell you.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.690
I sealed this entire place
in Thunder-tanium.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.259
There's literally no way out.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.194
- What? Why would you do that?

14:56.196 --> 14:58.930
- Well, back in my evil days,
I was gonna trap you

14:58.932 --> 15:00.698
and sell you to Dark Mayhem.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.067
I don't wanna bore you
with details.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.736
- The girls think
we're out camping.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.537
It could be days
before anyone finds us.

15:06.539 --> 15:10.074
- Well, hey, Colosso can never
just leave us here.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.309
I'm sure he feels terrible,

15:11.311 --> 15:14.212
and he's gonna let us out
any second.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.248
- ¶ They're fighting crime ¶

15:17.250 --> 15:19.918
¶ Sticking together ¶

15:19.920 --> 15:23.054
¶ Best Chefs Forever ¶

15:23.056 --> 15:26.958
¶ Best Chefs Forev-ever ¶

15:26.960 --> 15:31.262
¶ Oh, yeah ¶¶

15:33.333 --> 15:35.867
Ah, good stuff.

15:35.869 --> 15:36.668
- ¶

15:36.670 --> 15:38.870
- Wow, we really
broke Mom's heart.

15:38.872 --> 15:41.873
- Yeah, I've never
seen her do that before.

15:41.875 --> 15:47.712
- [thunder rumbling]

15:48.615 --> 15:51.916
- Whatever you did to Mommy,
you better fix it!

15:51.918 --> 15:53.284
- [thunder rumbles]

15:53.286 --> 15:53.952
- Chloe's right.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.820
We were so worried about
our show being spoiled,

15:55.822 --> 15:57.822
we ended up spoiling
Mom's special night.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.624
- Let's get out there,
apologize,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.693
and give her a big hug.

16:01.695 --> 16:04.195
- [thunder rumbling]
- ALL: Ah!

16:05.198 --> 16:06.364
- Alright, new plan.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.800
We are gonna give her
the best girls' night

16:08.802 --> 16:10.635
in the history of the McBoogers!

16:10.637 --> 16:13.338
Boy, that is
an unfortunate last name.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.040
- ¶

16:16.042 --> 16:18.676
- I'm so cold and hungry.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.912
- [growling]

16:20.914 --> 16:21.713
- What was that?

16:21.715 --> 16:24.782
- My stomach.
I said I was hungry.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.650
- The girls were right.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.786
We're no better
than that whiny survivalist.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.722
- You're right.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.858
But maybe that's a good thing.

16:33.860 --> 16:34.759
- What do you mean?

16:34.761 --> 16:37.328
- I mean, all the best stuff
is inside.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.131
Like the couch, and the TV.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.165
- Ooh, and the refrigerator.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.868
- And the Grand Canyon!

16:43.870 --> 16:46.104
- No, but I like your passion.

16:46.106 --> 16:50.174
My point is, we should be proud
of who we are.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.643
We're not outdoorsmen.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.746
We're indoorsmen.

16:54.748 --> 16:55.346
- BOTH: Yeah!

16:55.348 --> 16:57.215
- And we will survive
this slide!

16:57.217 --> 16:57.915
- BOTH: Yeah!

16:57.917 --> 16:59.817
- Because it's indoors!
- BOTH: Yeah!

16:59.819 --> 17:02.954
- Now, does anyone have a plan
to get us out of here?

17:02.956 --> 17:04.689
- BOTH: No!

17:04.691 --> 17:07.959
- ¶

17:07.961 --> 17:08.693
- Come look, Mommy.

17:08.695 --> 17:12.230
- Chloe, I already told you,
McBooger night's a McBust.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.399
- You sure about that?

17:14.401 --> 17:17.201
- BOTH: Howdy-do!

17:17.203 --> 17:18.836
- What's going on?

17:18.838 --> 17:20.705
- We behaved like
a couple of cow patties,

17:20.707 --> 17:23.107
so we're giving you
the McBooger girls' night

17:23.109 --> 17:24.876
of your dreams.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.178
- ALPACA: [vocalizes]

17:27.180 --> 17:29.247
- A real alpaca?

17:29.249 --> 17:32.083
Girls, you don't
have to pretend anymore.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.118
I know you don't wanna
do my girls' night.

17:34.120 --> 17:40.324
- Just enjoy the jug band sounds
of the Thunder Gals!

17:41.995 --> 17:43.061
- ¶

17:43.063 --> 17:45.263
¶ Well, there ain't no jugging
if we don't have Barb ¶

17:45.265 --> 17:47.432
¶ No, there ain't no jugging,
though she worked so hard ¶

17:47.434 --> 17:50.101
¶ With her family and her ap
making sweet, sweet music ¶

17:50.103 --> 17:53.071
¶ Family and her ap
like there's nothing to it ¶

17:53.073 --> 17:55.973
¶ A country girl at heart, a
McBooger through and through ¶

17:55.975 --> 17:57.909
¶ Looks, smart,
lightning power too ¶

17:57.911 --> 18:00.044
¶ With her family and her heart,
and her family pride ¶

18:00.046 --> 18:05.149
¶ With her children and her
husband always by her side ¶¶

18:08.188 --> 18:12.790
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

18:12.792 --> 18:14.425
- I don't think
she liked the song.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.128
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

18:17.130 --> 18:20.765
- Girls, is this a wild alpaca?

18:20.767 --> 18:21.766
- Uh, we don't know.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.201
Colosso helped us find it.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.869
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

18:24.871 --> 18:27.271
- Oh yeah,
this baby's wild alright.

18:27.273 --> 18:31.309
And that's what you get for
leaving me out of girls' night.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.343
- It's a girls' night!

18:32.345 --> 18:34.779
Not a 48-year-old rabbit night!

18:34.781 --> 18:38.783
- [gasps] You told them my age!

18:38.785 --> 18:41.219
Enjoy your alpaca-lypse!

18:41.221 --> 18:43.187
[evil laughing]

18:43.189 --> 18:44.922
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

18:44.924 --> 18:46.157
- I should go.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.859
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

18:47.861 --> 18:48.860
- Me, too!

18:48.862 --> 18:50.795
Later.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.231
- Girls, take cover!

18:53.233 --> 18:57.468
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

18:57.470 --> 19:00.071
- [glass shattering]

19:00.073 --> 19:02.373
- We should be safe
from the raging alpaca

19:02.375 --> 19:05.176
as long as she's not a spitter!

19:05.178 --> 19:09.147
- [water spraying]

19:09.149 --> 19:12.216
- I think she's a spitter.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.384
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

19:13.386 --> 19:15.219
- Phoebe, freeze
that fluffy beast!

19:15.221 --> 19:16.554
- No! No, I'll handle it!

19:16.556 --> 19:20.024
I was the best alpaca barker
in the tristate area.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.926
- Where there many?
- Actually, yes.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.162
They taught it
at the high school.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.934
[growling]

19:29.936 --> 19:32.870
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

19:32.872 --> 19:33.371
- Okay.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.507
She wants to hear an apology
from all of us.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.043
- Are you sure?
- Just do it.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.046
- [clears throat]

19:42.048 --> 19:43.581
- GIRLS: [growling]

19:43.583 --> 19:45.850
- No, like you mean it.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.420
- GIRLS: [growling]

19:49.422 --> 19:54.258
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

19:54.260 --> 19:56.594
- There, there, little friend.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.266
- Oh, Mom, that was
beyond impressive.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.267
- We are beyond sorry.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.304
We never should have put our
show above your girls' night.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.072
- We know how important
they are to you.

20:08.074 --> 20:11.275
- Well, it's not the activities
I look forward to.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.376
I'd be happy doing anything

20:12.378 --> 20:16.080
as long as I'm doing it
with my girls.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.084
- Best McBooger night ever!

20:20.086 --> 20:20.551
- Aw!

20:20.553 --> 20:24.288
You know, after you clean up
this mess, I think I know

20:24.290 --> 20:28.993
a way we can spend
the next 12 hours together.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.896
- ¶

20:31.898 --> 20:34.365
- Can't believe she gave her
the last piece of wedding sushi

20:34.367 --> 20:36.267
even though she knew
it had the antidote.

20:36.269 --> 20:40.271
- That's what Best Chefs Forever
do for each other.

20:40.273 --> 20:43.140
- That was the worst show
I've ever seen.

20:44.043 --> 20:47.111
But I love hanging out
with you guys.

20:47.113 --> 20:50.081
- Hey! Didn't boys
use to live here?

20:50.083 --> 20:50.581
- Yeah.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.482
- Yeah, they aren't home yet.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.417
I guess they actually
made it through the night.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.152
- Yeah, we were
awfully hard on them.

20:55.154 --> 20:58.122
Maybe they are
survivors after all.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.124
- Think again!

21:00.126 --> 21:02.059
- [machine beeps]

21:03.663 --> 21:07.064
- We're free!

21:07.066 --> 21:07.932
- [laughing]

21:07.934 --> 21:11.335
The refrigerator! Mwah!

21:11.337 --> 21:12.637
- [heavy breathing]

21:12.639 --> 21:15.506
The couch!

21:15.508 --> 21:17.308
- The Thunder Monitor!

21:17.310 --> 21:19.377
I met your baby.

21:20.146 --> 21:23.180
- Wait, you guys
were in the slide all night?

21:23.182 --> 21:23.781
- Correction.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.217
We were surviving
in the slide all night,

21:26.219 --> 21:27.418
'cause we're Thunder men.

21:27.420 --> 21:32.490
- ¶ Thunder men, Thunder men,
Thunder men ¶

21:35.094 --> 21:37.428
- We were attacked by
a wild alpaca in our own home,

21:37.430 --> 21:40.231
and that's still
the weirdest thing we've seen.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.200
- Well, I hope you all learned
a valuable lesson

21:43.202 --> 21:45.970
for leaving me out
of your plans.

21:45.972 --> 21:46.570
- We did, buddy.

21:46.572 --> 21:49.640
And I know exactly how to make
it feel like you were

21:49.642 --> 21:52.310
part of all of our nights.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.311
- ¶

21:53.313 --> 21:55.046
- Very funny, Max!

21:55.048 --> 21:56.247
Ha-ha-ha!

21:56.249 --> 21:57.114
Joke's over!

21:57.116 --> 21:59.984
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]
- Hm?

21:59.986 --> 22:02.119
Is the alpaca in here?

22:02.121 --> 22:03.487
Take it easy, buddy!

22:03.489 --> 22:05.623
- ALPACA: [vocalizing]

22:05.625 --> 22:08.459
- I want my mommy!
