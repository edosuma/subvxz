WEBVTT

00:10.386 --> 00:13.389
Never thought I'd have
to be afraid in Margrave.

00:13.389 --> 00:15.307
Still no leads?

00:15.391 --> 00:17.768
Nothing useful.

00:17.852 --> 00:21.230
Stuff we're being told
to chase down...

00:21.230 --> 00:22.940
don't feel like the way to go.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.443
You talk to Finlay about it?

00:25.443 --> 00:28.237
He keeps shutting me down.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.572
When he's even around.

00:29.572 --> 00:32.158
Since Roscoe slugged Teale,
I haven't see him.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.160
Me and Baker are kind of
on our own.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.454
I tried calling Paul
again today.

00:36.454 --> 00:38.497
Charlie, too.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.918
They ain't gonna answer.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.421
They're in the wind or...

00:45.421 --> 00:47.590
or worse.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.843
I've been thinking
maybe we should leave.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.846
Even if y'all solve this,
with Mr. Kliner dead,

00:53.846 --> 00:55.681
I'm afraid this town
will just go right back

00:55.765 --> 00:57.808
to the way it was
before he came here.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.060
My parents would love
to have us in Tupelo.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.062
I know.

01:02.146 --> 01:05.107
And pretty soon, we're gonna
need the free babysitting.

01:06.776 --> 01:08.527
When can we start
telling people?

01:08.611 --> 01:11.489
Soon.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.079
Taxi? Taxi!

02:00.079 --> 02:02.373
Over here! Hi.

02:12.967 --> 02:16.095
Germany.
A new adventure, no?

02:16.095 --> 02:18.347
This is not an adventure.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.683
It's a punishment.
Germany's boring.

02:20.683 --> 02:22.476
It will be different this time.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.021
Look at my boys.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.065
You look so confused right now.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.109
You see good people
getting punished,

02:30.109 --> 02:31.610
bad people getting
what they want,

02:31.694 --> 02:33.070
and don't understand why.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.697
I'm going to tell you something

02:34.697 --> 02:36.574
that won't make much sense now,

02:36.574 --> 02:39.952
but hopefully, it will one day,
when you're older.

02:39.952 --> 02:44.415
Joe, you don't need to solve
all the world's problems.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.625
Solving some
is more than enough.

02:46.709 --> 02:51.171
And Reacher, you have the
strength of three boys your age.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.549
What will you do
with that strength, hmm?

02:56.719 --> 02:59.513
You're going to do what's right.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.004
Nice outfit.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.214
My other clothes
got blood on them.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.050
Some of it was mine.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.676
Knife. Gun.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.929
It's in the console.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.813
So what'd you learn in New York?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.607
It's all about the paper.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.400
Ink's easy to get,
plates are doable;

03:53.484 --> 03:55.527
acquiring the right
currency paper,

03:55.611 --> 03:57.237
- that's the trick.
- And?

03:57.321 --> 03:58.989
Well, there was only one place
in the country that made

03:59.073 --> 04:02.117
the paper and Joe had it
locked down like Sing Sing...

04:02.201 --> 04:05.120
- Unless...
- Unless he didn't.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.748
Unless he didn't.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.210
Could've been someone dirty on
the inside Joe wasn't aware of.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.963
Hubble was a currency manager,
dealt in hard cash.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.798
He could've been working
with somebody at the supplier

04:15.798 --> 04:17.800
- who was compromised.
- Okay.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.885
Anything else?

04:19.969 --> 04:22.429
Ran into another one
of those Venezuelan guys.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.306
What happened?

04:24.390 --> 04:26.266
We played Hangman.

04:29.812 --> 04:33.065
Take me to the body shop.
Got to pick up the Bentley.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.027
I need to make a stop first.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.988
You're going to want
to stay in the car.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.077
Mr. Kliner didn't
have many blood relatives

04:45.077 --> 04:46.495
in Margrave.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.914
Just his son and nephew.

04:48.998 --> 04:52.418
But I like to think he had
a town full of family.

04:52.418 --> 04:56.171
I know he embraced us like kin.

04:56.255 --> 05:00.801
The righteous perish,
and no one takes it to heart.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.638
The devout are taken away,

05:04.722 --> 05:08.767
and no one understands that
the righteous are taken away

05:08.851 --> 05:10.894
to be spared from evil.

05:12.563 --> 05:16.483
Those who walk uprightly
enter into peace.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.906
They find rest
as they lie in death.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.983
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

05:58.067 --> 06:00.027
Paying my respects.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.572
Really? Know what I think?

06:03.572 --> 06:05.657
I think you killed him.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.286
How would you like it
if I sliced you up

06:09.286 --> 06:10.913
just like you sliced him?

06:10.913 --> 06:12.414
Hmm?

06:14.875 --> 06:18.712
One, I'm not paying
my respects to your uncle,

06:18.796 --> 06:20.672
'cause I never respected him.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.634
But he meant a lot
to the people of this town,

06:23.634 --> 06:26.929
so I'm paying my respects to
Margrave as its chief detective.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.890
Two.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.767
Take a step back, son,

06:31.767 --> 06:34.770
or there will be two Kliners
in that grave.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.274
I'll see you around, Finlay.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.901
Mm-hmm.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.043
Seems like that went well.

06:58.127 --> 06:59.795
Shut up.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.591
Let's go get the car.

07:10.139 --> 07:12.266
Did Roscoe check in
with you lately?

07:12.266 --> 07:15.769
No, but I should hear
from Picard later today.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.116
Hey, Bentley man.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.993
Sorry, boss, you'll have
to come back this afternoon.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.537
I ain't got but two
of them windows tinted yet.

07:33.537 --> 07:34.955
Good enough.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.582
You want to take it half-done?

07:36.582 --> 07:39.251
Only rock stars need
four tinted windows.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.170
I'll pay full price.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.551
Suit yourself, Chief.
I'll bring it around.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.762
Tim, get some kitty litter
on that oil spill.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.893
Now, you sure are comfortable
spending a counterfeit roll.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.312
You want me
to buy you something?

07:58.312 --> 08:00.772
How about some jeans and tickets
to a Hall & Oates concert?

08:08.071 --> 08:10.991
Yeah, this is Captain Finlay.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.712
Okay, I'll be right there.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.218
What's going on?

08:43.565 --> 08:46.235
Guess this answers our question.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.155
Which one?

08:50.239 --> 08:52.157
Whether Stevenson was dirty.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.368
He must've been involved
to get the same treatment

08:54.368 --> 08:57.329
- as the Morrisons.
- This isn't the same.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.415
Way Chief Morrison was killed
was about sending a message.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.627
- This is different.
- How so?

09:03.627 --> 09:06.255
Well, for one,
they left his balls attached.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.923
It's the first thing I checked.

09:07.923 --> 09:11.551
Exactly. They didn't want
Stevenson going into shock.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.970
They wanted him lucid.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.846
Wanted him to watch.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.598
The tape, the mirrors.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.059
They tortured his wife
in front of him.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.479
And there was nowhere he could
look and not see. Jesus.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.357
This was about
getting information.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.693
It means Stevenson
wasn't involved.

09:27.693 --> 09:30.821
Dawson must have found the hole
in the roof of his truck,

09:30.821 --> 09:32.823
knew we were getting close
to the truth.

09:32.823 --> 09:36.743
We were all MIA, so they went
after the next best source.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.912
Stevenson and Hubble
were family.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.373
They saw him talking
to Roscoe, to you, to me.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.916
We thought he was
working with them

09:43.000 --> 09:44.334
while they thought he was
working with us.

09:46.086 --> 09:50.090
If we'd let him in, maybe
we could've protected these two.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.383
Three.

09:53.385 --> 09:56.680
Finlay? Reacher? A word.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.821
What do you want?

10:14.031 --> 10:16.491
I'm letting you go.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.909
On what grounds?

10:17.993 --> 10:19.578
On the grounds
that you're not up to the task.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.955
How many more of my men
have to be slaughtered

10:22.039 --> 10:23.790
before you accept the job
is too big for you?

10:23.874 --> 10:25.167
Hell, you couldn't even
hold onto

10:25.167 --> 10:27.252
a little girl cop
that assaulted me.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.588
This town is crooked
as scoliosis, and the cop

10:29.588 --> 10:31.965
that's barely been here is the
one that's getting railroaded?

10:32.049 --> 10:33.633
I'm doing you a favor.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.427
You leave before there's
any more stink on you,

10:35.427 --> 10:38.388
maybe you can land a paycheck
as a security guard somewhere.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.350
Now go on back to the station,
pack up your shit.

10:41.350 --> 10:44.895
Leave your gun and your badge
on my desk on the way out.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.104
And you.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.190
You're not a cop.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.608
You got one minute
to leave my crime scene

10:49.608 --> 10:51.485
or I'm taking you in.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.529
I buried one good man today
and saw another one gutted,

10:54.613 --> 10:55.947
not to mention his bride.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.366
Don't test me.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.743
Now I've got to call
over to Warburton County,

10:59.743 --> 11:02.245
have them send me
some real police.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.961
So he gets rid of me without
having to drop another body.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.339
We won't get access
to evidence now.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.590
Maybe we can
get something off Jasper

11:13.590 --> 11:14.966
when the lab work comes back.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.176
Hey, hey. Hey.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.388
I got to tell Stevenson's
parents what happened.

11:19.388 --> 11:23.183
Might not be a cop anymore,
but he was under my charge.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.352
Least I can do
is look them in the eye

11:25.352 --> 11:27.604
and tell them they lost
their son and daughter-in-law.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.065
And grandchild.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.484
Yeah.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.361
I know you're angry.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.488
I am, too.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.615
But don't do anything crazy
while I'm gone.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.158
Stick to the plan.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.494
Go see what you can find
at Hubble's.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.037
I will.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.123
But first, I'm gonna ask the
last cop in Margrave to lunch.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.176
Barely touched your grub.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.263
Not much of an appetite.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.723
You're not upset
about Stevenson?

12:05.058 --> 12:08.520
What the hell kind of thing
is that to say?

12:08.520 --> 12:12.190
I've known that kid
since he was our paperboy.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.527
My aunt taught his wife choir
in high school. It's just...

12:16.528 --> 12:17.571
Just what?

12:19.573 --> 12:22.367
Crying about it ain't gonna
do them any good.

12:22.451 --> 12:25.370
Way to honor them
is you find out who did it

12:25.454 --> 12:27.080
and you switch off their lights.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.878
Think Stevenson made an enemy
of someone he put in jail, too?

12:32.878 --> 12:35.464
Just like Teale
thinks Morrison did?

12:36.548 --> 12:38.133
Sounds like you don't.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.510
Teale's theory is bullshit.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.345
Want me
to bag that up for you?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.555
Please.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.265
Peach pie, darling.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.683
What about you, hon?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.643
- I guess I'll take the peach...
- Anything but pie.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.812
Officer Baker just ordered
our last piece.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.148
See, you snooze,
you lose, Reacher.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.774
Place has the best peach pie
in the state.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.694
So I've heard.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.696
Nothing for me, thanks.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.364
So,

13:01.448 --> 13:03.492
if you don't think
Teale's right,

13:03.492 --> 13:05.827
who do you think is cutting down
all these people?

13:05.911 --> 13:08.622
- And why are you telling me?
- Second question first.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.212
I think you're the only one
in Margrave I can trust.

13:15.212 --> 13:18.215
You got that right.
What makes you say so?

13:18.215 --> 13:20.383
Well, Morrison,
Kliner and Stevenson

13:20.467 --> 13:22.636
were all killed
in dramatic ways.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.179
Someone was trying

13:24.179 --> 13:26.640
"This is what happens
when you screw up."

13:26.640 --> 13:28.850
They went after Roscoe, too.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.186
But you know who
they didn't go after?

13:31.186 --> 13:33.104
They didn't go after you.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.148
Means you're not involved.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.817
But maybe you are.

13:37.901 --> 13:41.071
Now, all this started happening
when you showed up, right?

13:41.071 --> 13:42.906
Why should I trust you?

13:42.906 --> 13:45.200
That takes us
to your first question,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.786
who's cutting
all these people down?

13:47.786 --> 13:49.454
I was in Memphis
when Kliner was murdered,

13:49.538 --> 13:51.039
New York when the Stevensons
were killed,

13:51.039 --> 13:52.791
Alabama the night
someone went after Roscoe

13:52.791 --> 13:55.126
and Florida when Jobling
and my brother died.

13:55.210 --> 13:58.505
There are bus company and
FAA records to confirm it all.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.341
My alibi's airtight.
You can check for yourself.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.011
Already did.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.472
I keep eyes on outsiders.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.099
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

14:09.099 --> 14:13.353
'Cause we both know I'm not
the only outsider in Margrave.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.942
Talking about your buddy Finlay.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.403
He's not my buddy.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.489
He's someone I'm using
to find who killed Joe.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.366
But I started thinking,

14:26.366 --> 14:29.869
this whole thing's about
dirty cops, and you're clean.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.872
And Teale didn't become chief
until after the killing started.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.499
Finlay's the only one left.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.377
He was in Margrave
when all the murders happened.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.462
Seems like every time I leave
town and the guy's alone,

14:39.546 --> 14:41.214
someone else dies.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.468
Come on, Baker.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.012
Minute he walked in
the station house

14:47.012 --> 14:49.180
I could feel the hate
between you two.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.599
There's something off
about Finlay.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.142
You sensed it
from the beginning.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.147
Damn right I did.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.316
One goodbye bag,

14:59.316 --> 15:01.818
one slice of heaven.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.863
Need anything else,
you let me know.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.197
Thanks.

15:06.281 --> 15:09.826
Finlay's behind all this
and I'm gonna prove it.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.411
Think about it.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.455
He finds Hubble's phone number
in my brother's shoe,

15:13.455 --> 15:16.499
then Hubble suddenly panics
and confesses to the murder?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.126
Sounds like bullshit.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.047
There's got to be a reason
Finlay wanted Hubble

15:22.047 --> 15:24.215
to go down for killing Joe.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.594
I'm breaking in
to Hubble's house tonight

15:27.594 --> 15:29.638
and I'm turning the place
upside down

15:29.638 --> 15:32.474
till I find something
that directly connects

15:32.474 --> 15:33.850
Hubble to Finlay.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.979
Good.

15:38.063 --> 15:41.816
You find anything,
you bring it straight to me.

15:41.900 --> 15:45.445
Back at you.
You know where I'll be.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.031
Absolutely.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.038
Got a new shipment

16:37.122 --> 16:38.623
Not hunting deer.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.725

tomorrow morning,

20:35.652 --> 20:38.821
<i>we also have

<i>Margrave, Peachtree City,

20:42.742 --> 20:44.243
<i>Greenville and Zebulon.</i>

20:44.327 --> 20:45.954
<i>The greater Macon area
is still under watch,</i>

20:45.954 --> 20:48.039
<i>but that could change,
uh, seeing as rain</i>

20:48.039 --> 20:49.958
<i>is coming down at a rate
of two to three inches</i>

20:49.958 --> 20:51.501
<i>per hour right now.</i>

21:20.655 --> 21:22.448
<i>...in parts of the metro area,</i>

21:22.532 --> 21:24.867
<i>and we're getting reports
of some low-lying spots</i>

21:24.951 --> 21:26.244
<i>becoming inundated.</i>

21:26.244 --> 21:28.663
<i>Keep that in mind,

21:28.663 --> 21:30.915
<i>it's difficult to tell how deep</i>

21:30.999 --> 21:33.960
<i>some of this ponding

21:58.192 --> 21:59.527
<i>...reports coming.</i>

21:59.527 --> 22:00.987
<i>A viewer in Warburton County</i>

22:00.987 --> 22:02.947
<i>sent us this video
of his basement flooding.</i>

22:03.031 --> 22:05.783
<i>He says that the sump pump
isn't able to keep up...</i>

22:30.683 --> 22:34.145
<i>...now under
a flash flood warning.</i>

22:54.707 --> 22:56.501
Go see what he wants.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.570
<i>Lightning is dangerous.</i>

23:24.654 --> 23:26.197
<i>Take shelter in homes,</i>

23:26.197 --> 23:28.783
<i>businesses and hard-topped vehicles...</i>

23:31.077 --> 23:33.121
<i>But if you find yourself
out there in the elements,</i>

23:33.121 --> 23:35.289
<i>stay off elevated areas.</i>

23:53.724 --> 23:57.061
<i>...Fulton County

23:57.145 --> 23:58.229
<i>We also have

24:09.282 --> 24:11.951
<i>and Zebulon, as well

24:57.538 --> 25:01.250
<i>It only takes a foot of water
to wash a car off the road.</i>

25:03.002 --> 25:04.921
<i>Please be careful out there.</i>

28:21.784 --> 28:22.910
Reacher?

28:22.910 --> 28:24.620
I figured it out.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.248
I know how they're manufacturing
their money.

28:27.248 --> 28:28.999
What? How?

28:29.083 --> 28:31.919
The Columbia professor said
it all comes down to the paper,

28:31.919 --> 28:33.879
and Joe could never figure out
how they were getting the paper

28:33.963 --> 28:35.381
to print their cash.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.425
But I've traveled
all over the world,

28:37.425 --> 28:39.051
handled all kinds of currency.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.887
<i>Know what's unique
about U.S. banknotes?</i>

28:41.971 --> 28:43.764
Dollars are all the same size.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.724
<i>Bleach the ink
off a dollar bill,</i>

28:45.808 --> 28:47.601
<i>and you're left with perfect
paper that you can reprint</i>

28:47.685 --> 28:49.311
as any denomination you want.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.896
<i>Hubble was a skilled
currency manager.</i>

28:50.980 --> 28:53.274
<i>He kept Kliner flush with a
fresh supply of one-dollar bills</i>

28:53.274 --> 28:54.567
<i>from cash-intensive industries</i>

28:54.567 --> 28:57.111
that wanted to hide their income
from the government.

28:57.111 --> 28:59.447
<i>Payday loan services, casinos,</i>

28:59.447 --> 29:01.657
national chains
from immigrant neighborhoods.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.284
<i>The singles would be
shipped into Margrave</i>

29:03.284 --> 29:05.453
<i>from all over the country.</i>

29:05.453 --> 29:07.288
So much as one buck
goes missing,

29:07.288 --> 29:09.582
I'll cut off your hand
like it's Saudi Arabia.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.917
<i>Kliner Chemicals
must have developed something</i>

29:12.001 --> 29:13.043
to bleach the ink off the money

29:13.127 --> 29:14.587
without harming
the paper itself.

29:14.587 --> 29:18.090
<i>Runoff from this process
destroyed Chester, Mississippi.</i>

29:18.174 --> 29:19.884
Murdering an EPA agent
makes sense.

29:19.884 --> 29:22.011
If you're protecting a massive
counterfeiting operation,

29:22.011 --> 29:23.471
you can justify the kill.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.222
<i>Kliner protected it another way.</i>

29:25.306 --> 29:26.474
Animal feed.

29:26.474 --> 29:29.143
You got to be shitting me.

29:29.143 --> 29:30.895
Know why people
use kitty litter

29:30.895 --> 29:32.396
<i>to clean up oil spills?</i>

29:32.480 --> 29:34.398
<i>It contains diatomaceous earth.</i>

29:34.482 --> 29:36.358
It's an absorbent
coagulating agent

29:36.442 --> 29:38.152
used in everything
from pesticides

29:38.152 --> 29:40.404
- <i>to pool filters to...</i>
- Animal feed.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.739
<i>Damn right.</i>

29:41.739 --> 29:43.407
<i>You start ordering
massive amounts of D.E.,</i>

29:43.491 --> 29:44.825
<i>people get suspicious.</i>

29:44.909 --> 29:46.702
<i>But you buy feed
when you've got cows,</i>

29:46.702 --> 29:48.245
no one looks at you twice.

29:48.329 --> 29:49.872
<i>You grind it into a powder
to make</i>

29:49.872 --> 29:52.124
<i>an effective cleaning agent
for your chemical waste.</i>

29:52.208 --> 29:53.542
And since dumping it
into the river

29:53.626 --> 29:55.294
almost got you busted
last time...

29:55.294 --> 29:56.629
You bury it under some pasture

29:56.629 --> 29:58.589
where you've got
enough cows to sell the lies,

29:58.589 --> 30:00.591
but not enough to bring
state inspectors on your land.

30:00.591 --> 30:02.259
He was buying
truckloads of that.

30:02.343 --> 30:04.261
<i>I mean, his operation
must be massive.</i>

30:04.345 --> 30:06.972
Probably had a few
dozen people working for him,

30:07.056 --> 30:08.766
<i>all kept in line
with money and threats.</i>

30:08.766 --> 30:11.435
<i>Once the bills were washed,
they were dried,</i>

30:11.519 --> 30:12.811
<i>printed.</i>

30:12.895 --> 30:15.814
<i>One side, then the other.</i>

30:15.898 --> 30:18.859
<i>They use the old version
of the hundreds, pre-1990,</i>

30:18.943 --> 30:20.903
<i>so they don't have to make
the magnetic security strip</i>

30:20.903 --> 30:22.947
<i>they use in today's bills.</i>

30:22.947 --> 30:25.824
<i>The new hundreds are beat up,
made to look old</i>

30:25.908 --> 30:27.618
<i>so no one gives them
a second look.</i>

30:27.618 --> 30:30.496
<i>Truckers then drive the money
down to Florida,</i>

30:30.496 --> 30:33.374
<i>where it awaits its final
journey overseas to Venezuela.</i>

30:33.374 --> 30:35.626
Okay, but this
is just all theory.

30:35.626 --> 30:37.044
If we're gonna take this
to the feds,

30:37.044 --> 30:38.921
we need hard evidence,
and that's more than just

30:38.921 --> 30:40.089
those loose hundreds
that are in your pockets.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.633
We need fake cash

30:42.633 --> 30:44.718
that we can link
to Kliner's company.

30:44.802 --> 30:47.555
Joe put "Joblings' Garage"
on his punch list for a reason.

30:47.555 --> 30:50.432
He must have had some cash
stashed somewhere at his home.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.976
<i>Jobling's wife
showed us that garage.</i>

30:51.976 --> 30:54.144
There was nothing
in those boxes.

30:54.228 --> 30:56.313
I'm gonna go back
and tear the place apart.

30:56.397 --> 30:58.190
- Take Finlay with you.
- <i>I will.</i>

30:58.274 --> 31:00.192
How's everything on your end?

31:00.276 --> 31:02.486
Well, we had
a little excitement.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.946
- You okay?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

31:03.946 --> 31:05.364
Yeah, we are now.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.991
We're at, uh, Picard's place.

31:06.991 --> 31:09.785
Charlie and the kids are asleep.
I'm on first watch.

31:09.785 --> 31:10.995
It's actually probably
just about time

31:10.995 --> 31:12.329
for Picard to spell me.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.292
Go get some rest.
I'll fill Finlay in.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.502
You called me first?

31:19.587 --> 31:22.464
Yeah. I-I just wanted

31:22.548 --> 31:24.883
<i>to, you know, uh...</i>

31:24.967 --> 31:27.011
I missed talking to you, too.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.014
Good night, Roscoe.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.810
Everything cool?

31:36.270 --> 31:37.730
Better than cool.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.566
I think Reacher just busted
this whole thing wide open.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.160
Reacher.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.745
Meet me at Pete Jobling's house.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.788
We're about to close the lid
on this thing.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.959
Hold that thought.

32:03.881 --> 32:05.799
- We got a problem.
- What kind of problem?

32:05.883 --> 32:07.176
Three hitters.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.136
One headed
toward the motel office,

32:09.136 --> 32:10.262
probably to find out
which room I'm in.

32:10.346 --> 32:11.263
<i>That won't take long.</i>

32:11.347 --> 32:12.765
What about the other two?

32:12.765 --> 32:16.560
Standing out front,
looking scary.

32:16.644 --> 32:18.604
- <i>How'd they find me?</i>
- Teale may not like you,

32:18.604 --> 32:20.397
but he knows
what kind of guy you are.

32:20.481 --> 32:22.900
The kind that wants to look a
dead cop's parents in the eyes.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.319
I checked in under a fake name.

32:25.319 --> 32:28.113
Tell me you didn't park
your car right out front.

32:32.576 --> 32:33.702
Of course not.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.746
Okay. All right, listen closely.

32:35.746 --> 32:38.082
Is this where you say,
"They're gonna take you"?

32:38.082 --> 32:40.626
No. This is where I say,
"They're gonna kill you,

32:40.626 --> 32:41.835
unless you do what you're told."

32:41.919 --> 32:43.837
<i>Do you have a gun?</i>

32:46.340 --> 32:48.133
Yeah, my backup piece, uh...

32:48.217 --> 32:49.885
.32 snub nose.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.388
Better than screaming
for help. Barely.

32:52.388 --> 32:54.765
<i>Okay. Tell me what you see.</i>

32:57.059 --> 33:00.020
I see I'm in trouble.
Can't use the front door.

33:00.104 --> 33:02.731
So you make your own.
Turn the TV up loud.

33:04.817 --> 33:07.569
<i>Cavendish, drop that gun.</i>

33:07.653 --> 33:09.363
How close are you
to an end unit?

33:09.363 --> 33:11.907
- Uh, one room down.
- <i>Okay, good.</i>

33:11.907 --> 33:13.784
Tell me about the motel.
What kind of construction?

33:13.784 --> 33:15.828
Uh, low-rent, single-story.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.414
Probably in late '60s,
early '70s.

33:18.414 --> 33:19.665
So, cheap,
quarter-inch Sheetrock.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.625
Probably 24-inch spacing
between the studs.

33:21.709 --> 33:22.751
Do you have a pocket knife?

33:22.835 --> 33:24.086
What am I, a Boy Scout?

33:24.086 --> 33:27.172
Okay. Grab the bar
from the closet.

33:27.256 --> 33:28.632
He's on
the side of the law.

33:28.716 --> 33:31.427
<i>Well, this crook
is gonna take over Colby.</i>

33:38.392 --> 33:39.935
I need to speed this up.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.603
Ever seen a Kool-Aid commercial?

33:41.687 --> 33:42.855
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

33:46.817 --> 33:48.610
Here you are, Doc.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.696
- <i>While I tie him up.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

33:50.696 --> 33:52.948
<i>I hope they do make a move.</i>

33:52.948 --> 33:54.241
<i>Especially this one.</i>

33:56.827 --> 33:57.911
Jesus, what the hell?

33:57.995 --> 33:59.329
I'm a cop. Call 911.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.204
He shot out the tires! Run!

34:46.627 --> 34:48.462
Thanks for the assist.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.757
Anytime, Finlay.
See you at Jobling's.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.842
Be there by morning.

35:00.474 --> 35:03.477
I see.
Thank you, Chief.

35:05.687 --> 35:09.107
Near as they can tell, no one
was inside when it burned.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.568
Neighbor says Judy packed up
and left town a couple days ago.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.278
Good. Chief thinks
it could be arson.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.530
Probably started about the time

35:14.530 --> 35:16.031
those guys took
a run at me in Tupelo.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.533
They're cleaning up loose ends.

35:17.533 --> 35:18.909
Anything in there
that could've incriminated them

35:18.909 --> 35:20.410
is gone by now.

35:20.494 --> 35:22.162
They're spooked
after what happened

35:22.246 --> 35:23.914
at Hubble's house last night.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.457
What happened at Hubble's house?

35:25.541 --> 35:28.001
I killed Dawson Kliner
and four other guys.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.838
Okay.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.381
So now we've got nothing.

35:32.381 --> 35:35.551
Only bright side is Mrs. Jobling
wasn't here when they did it.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.637
She wasn't Mrs. Jobling.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.181
Judy never took
Pete's last name.

35:41.265 --> 35:43.725
Look at how Joe wrote
"Joblings' Garage."

35:43.809 --> 35:47.020
He put the apostrophe after
the "S." Plural possessive.

35:47.104 --> 35:48.605
Whatever was important to Joe

35:48.689 --> 35:50.232
is in a house
where two Joblings reside.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.067
- His parents' house.
- I keep telling you, Finlay...

35:52.067 --> 35:53.110
I know. Details matter.

35:53.110 --> 35:54.778
Let's go.

35:56.697 --> 35:58.907
If you think Pete hid something
out here, you're free to look.

35:58.991 --> 36:01.410
Just put everything back
where you found it.

36:01.410 --> 36:04.371
We will, ma'am. Thank you.

36:07.332 --> 36:10.752
Did you know my boy was dead
the last time you were here?

36:10.836 --> 36:12.671
Yes, ma'am.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.214
I did.

36:14.298 --> 36:16.842
Why didn't you tell us?

36:18.427 --> 36:21.513
You seemed like nice people.

36:21.597 --> 36:23.223
I didn't have the heart.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.570
How are we supposed to find
anything in all this mess?

36:36.570 --> 36:39.489
That was exactly the point
when Jobling hid it here.

36:39.573 --> 36:41.241
Mix it in with the clutter,
make it so you can't see

36:41.325 --> 36:43.869
the trees through the forest.

36:45.621 --> 36:47.205
That's how I used
to hide my fireworks.

36:47.289 --> 36:49.374
Parents never know
what their kids are into.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.712
But we know exactly
what we're looking for.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.757
Boxes just like the one
Roscoe and I saw at his house.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.389
Like these?

37:20.822 --> 37:22.199
Call Picard.

37:22.199 --> 37:23.408
Tell him to meet us
at the farmhouse

37:23.492 --> 37:24.952
where we left the Jaguar.

37:24.952 --> 37:26.703
We've got everything he needs to
take down the Kliner Foundation

37:26.787 --> 37:29.039
and Teale at the same time.

37:29.039 --> 37:31.959
I'll load this up in the Bentley
and meet you there.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.669
We got them, don't we?

37:33.669 --> 37:36.505
Damn right we do.

37:46.098 --> 37:48.016
Neagley.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.811
Found something on the shooter
who killed that EPA agent Wilks.

37:50.811 --> 37:54.690
- <i>Give it to me.</i>
- FBI agent named Nittmo caught the case.

37:54.690 --> 37:56.900
This is the guy who closed it
after barely looking into it?

37:56.984 --> 37:59.820
Yep. Called it a "burglary
gone bad" and wrapped it up.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.363
<i>I dug into Nittmo.</i>

38:01.363 --> 38:03.824
<i>Had an expensive home,
drove a pricey car.</i>

38:03.824 --> 38:05.534
Like Morrison
and Jobling.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.953
Living above apparent means.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.621
Got a copy of his ID badge.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.498
Six three, 220 pounds,

38:11.498 --> 38:14.167
<i>blonde, blue eyes.</i>

38:14.251 --> 38:16.586
Could definitely see people
calling him The Viking.

38:16.670 --> 38:20.424
Nickname of the hit man
hired to kill our EPA agent.

38:20.424 --> 38:21.883
I'd say we're making progress,

38:21.967 --> 38:24.428
but you keep talking about
Nittmo in the past tense.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.888
That's 'cause he died of cancer
three years ago.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.057
<i>But his old partner
is still with the Bureau.</i>

38:29.141 --> 38:30.517
<i>We can question him.</i>

38:30.517 --> 38:32.561
He's based out of
the Atlanta field office.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.229
Guy named...

38:34.229 --> 38:35.480
Picard.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.316
How the hell did you know that?

38:38.400 --> 38:39.985
Lucky guess.

38:42.112 --> 38:44.114
Got to go, Neagley.
