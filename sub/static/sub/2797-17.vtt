00:26.667 --> 00:28.667
(slo-motion laughing)

00:28.750 --> 00:34.375
I say I say, how-do! I am Victor Von Van,
builder of Norrisville's first

00:34.458 --> 00:37.709
Hydroelectric Plant:
the Van Dam!

00:37.792 --> 00:38.917
(laughing)

00:39.000 --> 00:41.458
Oh! That costume
is the cheese!

00:41.542 --> 00:44.166
We are so getting an "A"
on our history report!

00:44.250 --> 00:46.875
Yes, after crash-landing
on your planet,

00:46.959 --> 00:50.917
I harnessed the power of
the Brontosaurus Rex to construct...

00:51.000 --> 00:52.667
You stayed up all night
making that costume

00:52.750 --> 00:54.542
instead of studying
for our report, didn't you?

00:54.625 --> 00:57.333
Not all night.
I slept most of it.

00:57.417 --> 00:59.542
I spent a week
making this model.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.208
All you had to do was memorize
a couple of Van Dam facts!

01:02.291 --> 01:03.500
You have shoobed us!

01:03.583 --> 01:04.583
Cunningham!

01:04.667 --> 01:06.291
Look at this awesome costume.

01:06.375 --> 01:09.041
It doesn't matter what I say.
I am Von Van!

01:09.125 --> 01:10.291
That's insane.

01:10.375 --> 01:13.875
Putting on a Victor Von Van costume
doesn't make you Victor Von Van!

01:13.959 --> 01:17.208
Why not? Putting on a ninja
costume makes you a ninja.

01:17.291 --> 01:20.166
Hold up!
That's totally different.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.208
I am the Ninja!

01:22.291 --> 01:24.959
You are... when you put
the Ninja suit on.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.000
The rest of the time you're
Randy Cunningham.

01:27.083 --> 01:30.083
OK, so if you put the Ninja suit
on, you'd be the Ninja?

01:30.166 --> 01:34.500
That's ridiculous! If I put the
suit on I'd be Victor Von Ninja.

01:34.583 --> 01:35.959
And we'd fail
our report for sure!

01:36.041 --> 01:39.000
-(crashing sound)
-(screaming)

01:42.917 --> 01:43.875
(horn honking)

01:43.959 --> 01:45.875
I just passed inspection!

01:47.000 --> 01:49.875
I was chosen to be the Ninja for
a reason, Howard.

01:49.959 --> 01:53.000
And you're about to
peep that reason right now.

01:53.083 --> 01:56.166
You peep that reason, I don't
have to peep that reason.

02:00.583 --> 02:02.709
It's Ninja o'clock.

02:02.792 --> 02:04.291
Hiya, ya!

02:04.375 --> 02:06.000
Smoke bomb!

02:08.417 --> 02:10.083
(growling)

02:14.166 --> 02:16.125
Ninja Cold Balls!

02:19.875 --> 02:22.709
Uh-huh! You thought I was coming
with the sword, but what's this?

02:22.792 --> 02:23.875
You got Ninja'd!

02:23.959 --> 02:27.375
-(crowd) Ninja! Ninja!
-When you woke me from my slumber

02:27.458 --> 02:29.625
to show me the robot that would

02:29.709 --> 02:32.041
"finally beat the Ninja,"

02:32.125 --> 02:35.500
I assumed it would
finally beat the Ninja!

02:35.583 --> 02:39.041
And it will. We guarantee it.
With 100 percent certainty!

02:39.125 --> 02:40.875
(cheering)

02:40.959 --> 02:43.917
Dahh...
more like 95 percent.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.083
Fools!

02:46.166 --> 02:48.959
(crowd) Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

02:50.625 --> 02:52.834
(screaming)

02:52.917 --> 02:56.125
(grunts) Ninja Swing!

02:57.625 --> 02:59.291
Thank you, thank you,
thank you...

02:59.375 --> 03:02.542
You smell like rainbows.
Look out!

03:06.792 --> 03:07.959
Ninja Ring!

03:15.458 --> 03:18.041
OK, but were you
expecting this?

03:23.959 --> 03:28.291
Ooh! It's like that thing knew exactly
what the Ninja was going to do.

03:28.375 --> 03:32.417
That'd be the learning chip I installed.
Once the Ninja uses an attack,

03:32.500 --> 03:35.917
PsychoBot learns it and develops
a perfect counterattack.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.542
Very sneaky, Viceroy.
I love it!

03:40.375 --> 03:41.792
(grunting)

03:41.875 --> 03:43.500
(roars)

03:44.875 --> 03:46.417
Ninja Cold Balls!

03:49.417 --> 03:50.917
What the juice?!

03:52.208 --> 03:53.834
(grunting)

03:53.917 --> 03:56.125
You didn't slip.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.458
And it improves its skills
with each attack.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.875
Oh, Viceroy, what didn't you think of?

04:00.959 --> 04:03.000
Answer, nothing.

04:04.792 --> 04:07.875
Ninja Stab! Ninja Slice!
Why are you so good at this?!

04:07.959 --> 04:09.959
(robot) Learning: Ninja Stab.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.875
He just smiled!

04:11.959 --> 04:13.917
He just smiled! Where'd that
robot learn to be so smug?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.834
-Heee.
-Ooooh, right.

04:15.917 --> 04:17.458
Ninja Chain-sickle!

04:19.041 --> 04:20.667
-Ahh!
-We got him on the ropes!

04:20.750 --> 04:23.375
Get the Sorcerer!
Get the Sorcerer!

04:23.458 --> 04:27.583
(music plays)

04:27.667 --> 04:31.709
Why're you so honkin'
unstoppable?!

04:31.792 --> 04:34.208
(screams) Ice and I can't...
I can't stop...

04:34.291 --> 04:35.625
I can't stop!

04:36.500 --> 04:38.000
(Ninja groaning)

04:40.500 --> 04:42.000
(grunting)

04:42.083 --> 04:43.458
(crowd) Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

04:43.542 --> 04:45.458
Smoke... bomb.

04:47.083 --> 04:50.583
Maybe he's not mad. I mean, we
were pretty close this time.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.542
You have failed
me again, McFist!

04:53.625 --> 04:55.750
You have failed me again,
Viceroy!

04:55.834 --> 04:57.667
-(snapping sound)
-(screams) See what you did?!

04:57.750 --> 05:00.041
You made me throw
my back out yelling at you!

05:00.125 --> 05:03.458
Clear my calendar.
And call my masseuse!

05:03.542 --> 05:04.667
(growls)

05:13.583 --> 05:14.917
(chainsaw sound)

05:15.000 --> 05:16.166
(sheep bleeting)

05:18.500 --> 05:20.208
(cow mooing)

05:22.709 --> 05:24.250
(toilet flushing)

05:25.458 --> 05:26.458
Cunningham!

05:26.542 --> 05:28.959
-(grunting)
-Uh, you OK?

05:29.041 --> 05:30.917
No. That robot
knew my every move.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.625
Like it was reading my mind.
I am in deep cheese!

05:34.709 --> 05:37.166
We both are.
It crushed our model!

05:37.250 --> 05:41.083
I only beat it by accident.
I need a new move. Something unstoppable.

05:44.041 --> 05:45.458
What about our project?!

05:45.542 --> 05:47.000
Hmm?

05:47.083 --> 05:49.709
Then it falls to me,
Vincent Von Van,

05:49.792 --> 05:55.041
to stroke my magic chin beard
and summon the, uh... sky lords!

05:55.125 --> 05:57.458
Pretty sure I read
something about sky lords...

06:02.208 --> 06:04.458
Uh-uh. Nope.

06:04.542 --> 06:08.000
I already know all of those. I need
the biggest, Bruce-est move ever!

06:08.083 --> 06:10.083
(gasps)
"Ultimate Lesson:

06:10.166 --> 06:12.875
Do not enter
until all training is complete."

06:12.959 --> 06:15.250
Yes, now that's more like it!

06:16.041 --> 06:17.333
Ah, what?

06:17.417 --> 06:18.875
You didn't see that robot!

06:18.959 --> 06:21.000
I need that
Ultimate Lesson thing now!

06:21.834 --> 06:23.458
Let... me... in!

06:23.542 --> 06:24.542
Hiya!

06:28.834 --> 06:31.041
Yes, now that's more like it.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.166
Hiya!

06:38.041 --> 06:40.000
Yes, now that's more like it.

06:45.583 --> 06:50.750
T'was the best I could do without the help
of enslaved thunder lizards.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.959
Heh? Heh?

06:54.041 --> 06:57.417
Oh, I see. Silent treatment.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.125
Don't tell me you're still mad about
the whole costume thing, Cunningham.

07:01.208 --> 07:02.291
Who's Cunningham?

07:02.375 --> 07:04.417
-Mmm.
-Hmm?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.458
-Hmm?
-Mmm.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.959
Mmmmm.

07:10.041 --> 07:14.083
(girl) That robot made me permanently
ruin my good underwear.

07:14.166 --> 07:17.542
(robot) Learning
additional emotions: Fear.

07:17.625 --> 07:19.875
Why do I even bother?

07:19.959 --> 07:22.000
(robot)
Learning: Despair.

07:22.083 --> 07:26.125
If that robot made me miss Grinder Day
in Lunch Class, I'm gonna be angry!

07:26.208 --> 07:28.458
(robot)
Learning: Anger.

07:35.959 --> 07:39.083
Whoa! Shed-o <i>occupado!</i>

07:41.375 --> 07:43.291
-You don't remember anything?
-Nope.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.166
-You don't remember your name?
-I do not.

07:45.250 --> 07:48.125
Or our history report on the
Norrisville Van Dam?

07:48.208 --> 07:50.667
-What's Norrisville?
-Uh-huh.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.959
I see what you're doin'. Two can
play at this game, Cunningham.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.333
-What game?
-Exactly.

07:55.417 --> 07:58.834
-And who's Cunningham again?
-Oh, it is on!

07:58.917 --> 08:02.458
Let's see just how far you'll
take this amnesia thing.

08:02.542 --> 08:05.917
See that guy? Tell him
he smells like fish farts.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.875
Fish... Isn't that rude?
And dangerous?

08:08.959 --> 08:11.709
Oh, no.
He thinks it's hilarious.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.875
He loves fish. And farts.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.709
-Are you sure?
-Mmm-hmm.

08:16.792 --> 08:20.291
(laughs)
He's gonna bail any minute.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.333
(humming)

08:21.417 --> 08:22.834
Any minute.

08:22.917 --> 08:23.834
What do you want?

08:23.917 --> 08:25.166
Any minute now.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.250
-To make you laugh, amigo.
-He's gonna bail.

08:27.333 --> 08:30.625
Did you know
you smell like fish... far...

08:30.709 --> 08:31.917
(bell rings)

08:32.000 --> 08:33.917
Fish sticks!
And... roses!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.959
With a hint of leather.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.083
Best-smelling guy
in school. (laughs)

08:38.166 --> 08:39.291
New cologne?
Huh?

08:39.375 --> 08:41.291
Hey! He noticed!

08:41.375 --> 08:42.875
How come
youse guys never noticed?

08:42.959 --> 08:44.959
(moaning)

08:45.041 --> 08:49.208
Oh yeah. You, my friend, have
hands of steel. Literally.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.041
You're gonna want to see this.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.291
All I want to see
is you leaving.

08:52.375 --> 08:56.875
PsychoBot is back online.
And it's angry. Real angry.

08:56.959 --> 08:59.959
Ooh! (snapping sound)
Ow! I "ooh'd" too hard!

09:00.041 --> 09:02.041
You're Randy Cunningham.
You're my best friend.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.458
You love Grave Puncher
and talking ape movies.

09:04.542 --> 09:06.667
When you were seven you chipped
a tooth on my bunk bed

09:06.750 --> 09:08.875
in an incident our parents
still don't know about.

09:08.959 --> 09:12.000
How do you know so much about
the inside of my mouth, Harold?

09:12.083 --> 09:14.125
It's Howard! Howard!

09:14.208 --> 09:15.250
(crashing)

09:15.333 --> 09:16.917
(grunts)

09:17.000 --> 09:19.083
Huh? I bet you want to fight
that thing, don't you?

09:20.959 --> 09:24.792
Are you nuts? Who wants to...
fight a giant robot! So Bruce!

09:24.875 --> 09:27.083
No! No! Wait, that's crazy!

09:27.166 --> 09:29.667
It's not crazy!

09:29.750 --> 09:31.667
You're the Ninja!

09:31.750 --> 09:33.917
-Oh. I'm the Ninja.
-Mmm.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.083
(stuttering) I'm the what?!

09:41.291 --> 09:42.583
You have to
stop that thing!

09:42.667 --> 09:45.417
Look, man, I'd love to help,
But I am not a ninja!

09:45.500 --> 09:49.291
Yes, you are! You have this mask.
And all these honkin' weapons.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.959
And you have the... Nomicon!

09:52.041 --> 09:53.875
I'll bet you did this to him!

09:53.959 --> 09:57.125
You... have... to... undo it!

09:57.667 --> 09:59.792
Stupid book!

10:02.166 --> 10:05.583
Just put it on! It's a magic ninja suit!
It doesn't matter who wears it!

10:05.667 --> 10:08.917
A magic ninja suit? Really? Are you
listening to yourself right now?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.333
Magic ninja suit.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.917
You have to save the day!
That's what the Ninja does!

10:16.000 --> 10:19.291
If you know so much about being
the Ninja, then you save the day!

10:19.375 --> 10:22.458
You said it yourself. It doesn't
matter who wears the suit.

10:22.542 --> 10:25.125
And we need a hero. We need you.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.375
We need... Howell Wooter...

10:27.458 --> 10:29.667
Weinerman! Howard Weinerman!

10:29.750 --> 10:31.834
Ninth Grade Ninja.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.291

10:40.083 --> 10:41.834

10:45.917 --> 10:48.291
Unless that Ninja forgets
who the cheese he is.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.375
In which case,
his best friend has to step up.

10:51.458 --> 10:54.041
I am... Howard Weinerman!

10:54.125 --> 10:55.875

11:23.041 --> 11:25.333
Got my mask, my

11:25.417 --> 11:27.542
...which I do not want or need.

11:27.625 --> 11:30.875
I can't believe it! My best friend's
the Ninja! I'm gonna tell everyone!

11:30.959 --> 11:32.875
-You can't tell anyone!
-Well that stinks.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.000
We don't have time for this!

11:34.083 --> 11:36.250
-(yelling)
-(shooting sounds)

11:37.834 --> 11:39.291
So are you gonna...

11:39.375 --> 11:41.959
Me! Oh, right!
Yeah, I'm goin'.

11:46.458 --> 11:47.458
(yells)

11:48.667 --> 11:50.000
(all screaming)

11:52.083 --> 11:55.125
This does not bode well for my
emergency underpants!

11:55.208 --> 11:56.875
(Howard) Smoke bomb!

11:56.959 --> 12:00.709
(coughing) Ugh! I got it in my
mouth. It's in my mouth.

12:00.792 --> 12:03.083
Ninja! We're saved!

12:03.166 --> 12:05.208
Ninja, you look... weird.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.208
You're weird!
Now move, would ya?!

12:08.291 --> 12:10.125
Oh, Hensletter! Get off me!

12:10.208 --> 12:12.583
(crowd) Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

12:12.667 --> 12:16.333
Yeah! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

12:16.417 --> 12:17.917
(roaring)

12:18.000 --> 12:21.375
Somebody order a
Ninja Electro-Ball?

12:21.458 --> 12:22.709
Yes!

12:25.500 --> 12:29.041
(all) Aww.

12:29.125 --> 12:33.166
Sweet! You lulled it into thinking
it was safe. And then, zzzzt!

12:33.250 --> 12:36.208
Yeah. That is exactly
what I did.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.583
I know, I know...
you're shocked!

12:39.667 --> 12:41.333
-(laughing)
-(boy) That's funny.

12:41.417 --> 12:43.750
Mediocre zing...

12:44.417 --> 12:45.875
Classic Ninja!

12:45.959 --> 12:49.166
Ninja whatever-ball-this-is!

12:53.041 --> 12:56.166
(laughing) Deadly robot?

12:56.250 --> 13:00.417
More like Dudley No-butt!
Am I right?

13:00.500 --> 13:04.125
Granted I'm kinda new to this,
but that doesn't seem very Ninjalike.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.375
Stop it! Stop hitting yourself!

13:06.458 --> 13:08.125
Why you hitting yourself, robot?

13:08.208 --> 13:12.041
The Ninja's making that robot hit himself!
That's why I'm laughing!

13:14.750 --> 13:17.667
Check it out! Ninja Wedgie!

13:17.750 --> 13:19.250
OK, that's just wrong.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.375
(robot) Learning: Humiliation.

13:23.458 --> 13:25.291
Learning: Shame.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.125
Learning: Disgrace.

13:31.959 --> 13:37.917
Wah, wah. (blows nose) Wah!

13:40.375 --> 13:42.750
That was... awesome!

13:42.834 --> 13:46.208
I made a robot cry!
It's a big day for me! Big day!

13:48.583 --> 13:50.834
(Sorcerer yelling)

13:50.917 --> 13:54.000
You are wasting
my time, McFist!

13:54.083 --> 13:56.834
Guy's been in a hole for 800 years,
all of the sudden he's in a rush.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.250
-What was that?!
-(stammering)

13:59.333 --> 14:01.709
Why are you wasting the
Sorcerer's time, Viceroy?!

14:01.792 --> 14:03.750
You said that robot could learn
all the Ninja's moves!

14:03.834 --> 14:06.500
-It can.
-Then why did it lose?!

14:06.583 --> 14:11.041
Something's different about the Ninja.
PsychoBot has never seen those moves.

14:11.125 --> 14:14.166
And why's it crying?
That was embarrassing.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.000
It's crying because the Ninja
was a big meanie!

14:17.083 --> 14:19.417
I have had enough!

14:19.500 --> 14:21.000
(growling)

14:21.083 --> 14:23.750
This is all your fault, Viceroy!
(snapping sound)

14:23.834 --> 14:26.750
Ooh! My back! Get my hot pad!

14:31.375 --> 14:37.208
Artificial fear. Digital misery.
Binary humiliation.

14:37.291 --> 14:41.417
Time for me to take matters
into my own hands.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.875
(sobbing)

14:48.417 --> 14:49.792
(growling)

14:49.875 --> 14:51.792
(all cheering)

14:51.875 --> 14:53.917
Ninja Fivers!
Get 'em while they're high.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.834
'Cause when my arm gets tired,
they turn into low fives.

14:56.917 --> 15:01.417
Is it me or is the Ninja's behavior
a little, you know, wonkish...

15:01.500 --> 15:03.709
(laughing) Yeah, buddy.

15:03.792 --> 15:05.709
It is pretty shoob-tastic.

15:05.792 --> 15:09.875
Everybody lift with your knees.
One, two, I'm a hero!

15:09.959 --> 15:12.917
I guess shoob is the new cheese.
Hey, wait for me!

15:13.000 --> 15:15.041
-Huh?
-Whoop, there it is.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.083
Huh, looks like Howell
left his book on.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.083
What the juice?!

15:21.166 --> 15:23.542
(NinjaNomicon)
<i>Welcome back, Ninja.</i>

15:23.625 --> 15:26.500
Ninja?! Oh, no,
you got the wrong guy.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.041
Ninja's getting paraded around
by the student body right now.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.834
I can go get him.

15:30.917 --> 15:33.875
(NinjaNomicon) <i>You are pure of heart.</i>
<i>Brave beyond reason.</i>

15:33.959 --> 15:38.000
<i>You are unstoppable.</i>
<i>You are the Ninja.</i>

15:38.083 --> 15:40.500
That's what Wooterpapa was saying,

15:40.583 --> 15:43.500
but I feel like I would remember
something like that.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.667
(NinjaNomicon)
<i>When a Ninja's fight is done...</i>

15:49.750 --> 15:54.417
<i>...it is time for him to learn</i>
<i>The Ultimate Lesson.</i>

15:54.500 --> 15:57.375
<i>His mind is wiped</i>
<i>of all he has learned</i>

15:57.458 --> 16:00.959
<i>so that his experience may become</i>
<i>part of the NinjaNomicon.</i>

16:01.041 --> 16:04.417
I must'a been mind wiped!
I finished my ninja training!

16:04.500 --> 16:07.208
Was I an awesome ninja?
I bet I was awesome.

16:07.291 --> 16:11.333
Ultimate Lesson. Do not enter
until all training is complete.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.750
Yes, now that's more like it!

16:15.542 --> 16:17.458
Let me... in!

16:17.542 --> 16:18.750
Hiya!

16:20.083 --> 16:22.709
Ultimate Lesson!
Now that's more like it.

16:22.792 --> 16:24.000
Hiya!

16:26.875 --> 16:29.291
Yes, now that's more like it!

16:31.667 --> 16:36.083
I acted like a total shoob and
mind wiped myself! What have I done?

16:36.166 --> 16:40.458
Smoke bomb, everybody, smoke bomb.
Hungry Ninja comin' through.

16:40.542 --> 16:44.125
Listen, I'm a little light on cash,
so what do ya say you hook a Ninja up.

16:45.625 --> 16:46.834
I'm eatin' his Grinder.

16:46.917 --> 16:48.834
-(screams)
-(growls)

16:48.917 --> 16:50.625
Put me down.

16:50.709 --> 16:55.875
I mean... no one comes between
a Ninja and his grinder.

16:55.959 --> 16:57.417
Ninja Stick!

16:58.917 --> 17:02.208
OK... how 'bout Ninja Ring!

17:03.792 --> 17:07.250
You asked for it:
Ninja something ball!

17:07.333 --> 17:08.333
(flatulence)

17:12.083 --> 17:15.834
Sorry! That was a bee ball.
That's on me.

17:16.959 --> 17:19.041
There is nothing
Bruce about this!

17:19.125 --> 17:22.083
NinjaNomicon, you tried to stop me
from skipping the Ultimate Lesson!

17:22.166 --> 17:25.333
But I didn't listen. I should have
listened. Why didn't I listen?

17:25.417 --> 17:27.834
I'm sorry, Nomicon.
I'll never do it again.

17:27.917 --> 17:29.834
(beeping)

17:29.917 --> 17:31.208
I've said that before, haven't I?

17:31.291 --> 17:33.000
Well, this time I mean it!

17:33.083 --> 17:34.667
"Believe in the weapon
that is in the suit.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.834
Friendship is a weight
the Ninja cannot carry.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.834
When a Ninja does wrong he must
own up to his mistakes.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.458
A Ninja must know
when winning is losing.

17:40.542 --> 17:43.166
And losing is winning.
The way to forget is to remember."

17:43.250 --> 17:44.583
I remember this!

17:44.667 --> 17:46.458
I remember everything!

17:46.542 --> 17:49.417
I am Randy Cunningham! I am...

17:50.375 --> 17:53.166
...still Randy Cunningham.

17:54.667 --> 17:55.917
Howard! You OK?!

17:56.000 --> 17:57.875
No, not OK at all!

17:57.959 --> 17:59.083
Hey, you remembered who I am.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.834
And who I am. I know you don't want to
give back the suit, but...

18:01.917 --> 18:05.041
Take it! Take the suit!
Take everything back!

18:05.125 --> 18:06.709
I'm not the Ninja!

18:08.750 --> 18:12.250
Wait, wait! Ninjas don't run away
from danger! They run towards danger!

18:12.333 --> 18:15.375
(moaning) I'm not the Ninja!
Not the Ninja!

18:16.625 --> 18:21.750
Yes! Chaos spreading!
My power growing!

18:23.166 --> 18:25.250
(screaming)

18:25.333 --> 18:27.166
The mask!
Give me the mask!

18:27.250 --> 18:28.250
Right! Mask!

18:28.333 --> 18:30.834
(grunting)

18:35.792 --> 18:36.959
(Howard screaming)

18:38.417 --> 18:40.667
(Howard) Wait a minute,
what is this place?!

18:40.750 --> 18:43.208
Are you serious?
This is the Van Dam!

18:43.291 --> 18:45.041
It took 15 years to construct!

18:45.125 --> 18:48.208
There's enough concrete in this thing
to build a highway from here to the moon.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.750
Why would I know any of this?

18:49.834 --> 18:52.208
'Cause we are supposed
to give a report on it!

18:52.291 --> 18:54.125
Really? You wanna do this now?

18:55.375 --> 18:57.625
(robot) Learning: Revenge.

18:57.709 --> 18:59.875
-Howard!
-Ahhh!

19:04.542 --> 19:07.000
(grunting)

19:08.875 --> 19:10.083
Ninja Snatch!

19:13.000 --> 19:15.375
-I'm back!
-You are so back!

19:15.458 --> 19:18.083
Let's do this!

19:18.166 --> 19:21.166
That suit bunches up in some
really awkward places, am I right?

19:21.250 --> 19:23.083
Would you believe
I missed it?

19:23.166 --> 19:25.333
Ninja Block!
Ninja Block! Ninja Block!

19:29.000 --> 19:31.792
Ninja Slice!
Ninja Slice! Ninja Slice!

19:33.875 --> 19:36.375
-Oh, boy.
-It can do that now!

19:40.208 --> 19:41.208
What?

19:42.125 --> 19:44.792
Stanked robot?! What the juice?!

19:46.041 --> 19:51.959
You will never stop me, Ninja!
Soon I will be free!

19:54.166 --> 19:56.125
How do you destank a robot?

19:56.208 --> 19:58.834
Think, Ninja! You get stanked
when you're vulnerable.

19:58.917 --> 20:00.709
Howard made the robot cry.

20:00.792 --> 20:03.375
A robot can only cry if it's
been programmed with emotions!

20:03.458 --> 20:05.500
How do I make it lose its emotion?!

20:08.166 --> 20:10.333
Stanked Memory Chip!

20:12.583 --> 20:14.208
Ninja Chainsicle!

20:16.792 --> 20:19.917
Learning: Defeat.

20:24.125 --> 20:27.291
Remember this? Ninja Cold Balls!

20:34.417 --> 20:38.583
Hey, Ninja? Still down here.
Just didn't want you to forget.

20:40.166 --> 20:45.417
No! Freedom was
within my grasp!

20:45.500 --> 20:48.000
Nice seeing him fail
every once in a while.

20:48.083 --> 20:51.875
-This is my new favorite show!
-I can hear you!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.667
Not cool, Viceroy.
Not cool.

20:54.750 --> 20:58.917
Howard, you were the Ninja for ten minutes
and you destroyed the school.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.875
Yeah. Maybe you were
right about that whole

21:00.959 --> 21:04.208
"There's lot more to being the Ninja
than just putting on the suit" thing.

21:04.291 --> 21:08.959
Although if I could go in the Nomicon,
I bet I'd get that down in like no time!

21:09.041 --> 21:12.500
You're an epic jerk.
But you were there when I needed you.

21:12.583 --> 21:13.709
I won't forget that, buddy.

21:13.792 --> 21:17.792
Attention students! Due to the
catastrophic devastation,

21:17.875 --> 21:20.709
-all classes have been canceled!
-(all cheering)

21:20.792 --> 21:22.875
Do you realize what that means,
Cunningham?

21:22.959 --> 21:25.291
We don't have to give our report
on the Van Dam!

21:25.375 --> 21:28.041
Except for the students giving
Norrisville History Reports!

21:28.125 --> 21:31.000
Somehow the history classroom
was completely spared!

21:31.083 --> 21:33.583
Oh, Cunningham, we're shoobed!

21:33.667 --> 21:35.875
Please tell me you remember
our history report!

21:35.959 --> 21:38.458
-Actually I'm a little hazy.
-How hazy?

21:38.542 --> 21:40.583
Don't worry, I got it covered,
Horace!

21:40.667 --> 21:42.875
Howard! It's Howard!

21:42.959 --> 21:47.041
-Howard Grubersquash, I remember.
-Howard Weinerman!

21:48.625 --> 21:51.625
(theme music playing)
