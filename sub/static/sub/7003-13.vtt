00:00.967 --> 00:03.434
Welcome to tool time.
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor,

00:03.435 --> 00:06.270
And you all know my assistant -
al "thinks he's getting
a christmas bonus" borland.

00:08.307 --> 00:13.411
Well, as you all can see,
it's yule time on <i>tool time.</i>

00:13.412 --> 00:16.881
Before we get into
our project today, we have
a special feature for you.

00:16.882 --> 00:19.851
That's right, tim.
Binford stocking stuffers.

00:19.852 --> 00:22.020
There's nothing that says
"peace on earth" better

00:22.021 --> 00:23.788
Than a binford
power tool.

00:23.789 --> 00:24.990
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah.

00:26.626 --> 00:30.328
Doesn't al just
jingle your bell
sometimes?

00:30.329 --> 00:32.330
Heidi, the stocking stuffers,
please.

00:32.331 --> 00:34.465
<i>(♪ "deck the halls")</i>

00:38.237 --> 00:40.772
Here you go, tim.
Thank you, heidi.

00:40.773 --> 00:43.808
Now, stocking stuffers
usually...
<i>(music continues)</i>

00:43.809 --> 00:47.012
...Generally have...
Klaus! Whoo-hoo!
<i>(music stops)</i>

00:47.013 --> 00:48.813
Thank you.

00:48.814 --> 00:51.349
Stocking stuffers
sometimes are difficult
to pick out for men.

00:51.350 --> 00:54.285
But binford
has made it easy this year
with stuff like this.

00:54.286 --> 00:57.355
The new binford
mini propane torch. Huh?

01:03.395 --> 01:06.297
Stand back. Stand back.

01:06.298 --> 01:08.633
It's small, but portable enough
you can fit it in a pocket.

01:08.634 --> 01:11.069
Whoa! Wouldn't put it
in there, though.

01:11.070 --> 01:15.740
You can remove facial hair
with it.

01:15.741 --> 01:18.342
You can do a little
soldering on the house,
melt glass tubing,

01:18.343 --> 01:20.478
Or if your wife's out,
melt her earrings down

01:20.479 --> 01:22.446
And make handy fishing lures
out of them.

01:23.916 --> 01:27.952
Also, we have the binford 6100
digital torque wrench.

01:27.953 --> 01:31.289
It'll be the torque of the town
this christmas. Ho-ho-ho.

01:31.290 --> 01:34.325
That's right. They'll
also be torquing about...

01:37.096 --> 01:40.165
...The new
binford fiberoptic
flexible flashlight.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.134
As odd as it seems,
this is actually
a great gift for guys.

01:43.135 --> 01:46.071
This thing can find auto parts
strewn around the garage,

01:46.072 --> 01:49.640
Look in dirty pipes or any
dark, dusty area you have.

01:53.312 --> 01:56.247
In one ear,
out the other.

01:56.248 --> 01:58.883
Just like your job, al.

01:58.884 --> 02:01.686
In one day, out the other.

02:01.687 --> 02:04.989
Now, finally, for the man
without a vice,

02:04.990 --> 02:06.858
A vise. <i>(whistles)</i>

02:06.859 --> 02:09.026
The binford bench buddy 2000.

02:09.027 --> 02:11.262
It's got a swiveling base,
serrated steel jaws

02:11.263 --> 02:15.233
And a clamping capacity
of seven and one-half inches.

02:15.234 --> 02:17.102
<i>(to "jingle bells")</i>
♪ ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho...

02:17.103 --> 02:18.803

02:20.206 --> 02:23.407
♪ ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho-ho,

02:23.408 --> 02:26.310
The bench vise is too big
to be a stocking stuffer.

02:26.311 --> 02:28.679
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho,
are you ever right.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.715
If you want to stuff that
into a stocking,

02:30.716 --> 02:33.952
You need a special stocking,
like this one.

02:33.953 --> 02:37.188
Like one of al's mom's
thermal hunting socks.

02:43.295 --> 02:45.296
Don't let her in here.

02:45.297 --> 02:46.330
<i>(thundering footsteps)</i>

02:46.331 --> 02:48.166
It's your mom, al.

04:05.711 --> 04:07.879
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

04:12.351 --> 04:15.820
<i>(jill)</i> you are gonna be
the cutest little choirboy
in the whole service.

04:15.821 --> 04:17.521
You don't think
I look geeky?

04:17.522 --> 04:20.158
No. You look christmassy.

04:20.159 --> 04:23.694
If this were veterans day,
you'd look geeky.

04:23.695 --> 04:27.398
Jill, you won't believe
what doc johnson's doing.
Hi.

04:27.399 --> 04:29.968
Oh, hi, mark.
Nice robe.

04:31.971 --> 04:36.640
What's the "n" mean?
"naked under this robe
and no one can tell."

04:36.641 --> 04:40.311
Hey, show a little respect.
You're talking to the "n"
in "noel."

04:40.312 --> 04:42.347
I still think
I look geeky.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.415
You look very handsome.

04:44.416 --> 04:46.817
Now, let's get this thing off

04:46.818 --> 04:49.720
Before your brothers
come home and see you.

04:49.721 --> 04:51.990
Here. There we go.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.558
Jill, what would you say
if I told you

04:54.559 --> 04:57.528
That doc johnson
has dancing elves
up on his roof?

04:57.529 --> 05:01.165
I'd say he'd better
get those elf traps
out right away.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.834
I'm talking about
the neighborhood
decorating contest.

05:03.835 --> 05:06.304
I hate to say it,
but I think I might lose.

05:06.305 --> 05:10.541
You've lost nine years
in a row. I'd think you'd
be used to it by now.

05:10.542 --> 05:14.345
This year, I had
a really good feeling
about winning. It's odd.

05:14.346 --> 05:17.348
Every decoration I put up,
doc johnson's put up before me.

05:17.349 --> 05:20.985
Ah, it's just a coincidence.
Coincidence?

05:20.986 --> 05:24.355
I went to put a plastic santa
up there today... <i>(laughs)</i>

05:24.356 --> 05:27.525
...And guess what
old doc johnson's
got up on his roof.

05:27.526 --> 05:29.460
Chimney?

05:29.461 --> 05:31.996
A plastic santa.

05:31.997 --> 05:36.667
Gosh, I wonder what made him
think of using a santa claus
as a decoration at christmas.

05:38.304 --> 05:41.172
<i>(groans)</i>

05:41.173 --> 05:43.607
I'll tell you what else
he's got up there.

05:43.608 --> 05:47.211
My seven swans a-swimming
and my six geese a-laying.

05:47.212 --> 05:51.749
♪ and a tool man
in a nut tree ♪

05:51.750 --> 05:54.618
Hey, brad.
Guys, guess what.

05:54.619 --> 05:58.022
Tom wheeler's family invited me
to go skiing at boyd mountain.

05:58.023 --> 06:00.191
All right! Boyd mountain!
I love it up there.

06:00.192 --> 06:03.394
Tobogganing, skiing,
fractures, sprains,
broken bones,

06:03.395 --> 06:06.764
Laying at the bottom of the hill
in a stretcher...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

06:06.765 --> 06:08.766
When are you going?

06:08.767 --> 06:11.135
That's kinda what I need
to talk to you about.

06:11.136 --> 06:13.371
Well, it better not
be this weekend.

06:13.372 --> 06:16.807
We're running
a <i>tool time</i> marathon.

06:16.808 --> 06:19.810
40 straight hours
of tim and al high jinks.

06:19.811 --> 06:22.880
It's also christmas.
It's also christmas.

06:22.881 --> 06:26.584
Well, it is this weekend.

06:26.585 --> 06:28.119
Brad!

06:28.120 --> 06:30.421
But, mom, it's perfect.

06:30.422 --> 06:34.925
I don't have school,
and I can take your presents
with me and open them there.

06:37.062 --> 06:41.065
Do you feel the love
in this room? Do you?

06:41.066 --> 06:45.303
Brad, the family
is always together
at christmas.

06:45.304 --> 06:48.839
We open our stockings together,
we talk to the relatives
on the phone...

06:48.840 --> 06:52.510
You have your new saxophone.
You could play along
while we sing carols.

06:52.511 --> 06:53.944
And I'm gonna make

06:53.945 --> 06:55.946
Nana's special
oyster pecan stuffing.

06:55.947 --> 06:57.148
Ugh!

06:58.617 --> 07:02.387
Do you suppose there's room
for one more skier in that car?

07:02.388 --> 07:04.522
Mark is singing
in the choir. Come on.

07:04.523 --> 07:07.525
The wheelers will ask you
to go skiing some other time.

07:07.526 --> 07:09.793
But, mom, I don't wanna go
another time.

07:09.794 --> 07:11.996
It's gonna be great
skiing conditions.

07:11.997 --> 07:15.366
A lot of kids from school
are gonna be there.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.535
Honey, I can tell
this is important to you,

07:17.536 --> 07:20.004
But this family
is always together
at christmas.

07:20.005 --> 07:23.241
Even when your father
fell down the chimney,
we were together.

07:23.242 --> 07:26.810
We were in the emergency room,
but we were together.

07:26.811 --> 07:29.514
So you're saying I can't go?
No way.

07:30.849 --> 07:32.316
Dad!

07:33.985 --> 07:36.320
No, no, no, no.

07:36.321 --> 07:38.523
Come on, it's christmas.
A special time.
Your mom's right.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.991
It's not gonna be
a special time for me.

07:40.992 --> 07:43.727
So much for
a merry christmas.

find you among friends.

08:06.385 --> 08:08.986
Yeah. This is for
the roof display.

08:08.987 --> 08:11.589
These are the three
wise tool guys.

08:11.590 --> 08:16.727
Oh. They come from so far,
yet seem strangely familiar.

08:16.728 --> 08:19.464
Yes, don't they?
Mm-hmm.

08:19.465 --> 08:22.633
Halloween's over.
You can put away
the witch's broom.

08:22.634 --> 08:26.204
Tim, this is not
a witch's broom.
This is a julenek.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.406
A what-a-nek?
A julenek.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.874
It's a scandinavian
christmas tradition.

08:30.875 --> 08:34.511
Families bind sheaves of grain
to a long spruce pole,

08:34.513 --> 08:37.982
And that provides nourishment
for the sparrows in the winter.

08:37.982 --> 08:43.453
I wish
I could bind up doc johnson
and twist his little julenek.

08:43.455 --> 08:45.856
Tim, that's hardly
the christmas spirit.

08:45.857 --> 08:49.527
I know. I really thought
I could beat him this year
at the christmas display,

08:49.528 --> 08:51.695
But he's always seems to be
one step ahead of me.

08:51.696 --> 08:56.200
You know, so I see.
He just put three wise men
up on his roof, too.

08:56.201 --> 08:58.569
What?

08:58.570 --> 09:02.106
Where?
Over there.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.408
How does that guy
keep beating me
to the punch?

09:04.409 --> 09:08.179
Well, maybe the good doctor's
got esp.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.349
Now, what does having
a cable sports channel
have to do with this?

09:14.520 --> 09:17.121
No, I'm talking about
extrasensory perception.

09:17.122 --> 09:19.723
The ability to read
someone else's mind.

09:19.724 --> 09:22.160
Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.262
Maybe he should try
reading this.

09:30.569 --> 09:34.004
<i>(♪ saxophone played badly)</i>

09:34.005 --> 09:36.707
Lemme guess. Brad's practicing
on the saxophone,

Or there's an elephant
giving birth upstairs.

09:39.244 --> 09:40.244
Saxophone.

09:44.916 --> 09:47.017
Brad's so depressed
about not going on
the skiing trip,

09:47.018 --> 09:49.487
He's trying to play the blues.

09:51.623 --> 09:54.091
I should be playing the blues.
Hey, randy.

09:54.092 --> 09:56.727
I went to put
the three wise tool guys
up on the roof,

09:56.728 --> 09:59.697
And guess who's
already got 'em up.

09:59.698 --> 10:02.099
Doc johnson.
Bingo.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.268

he's got this house bugged.

10:04.269 --> 10:05.703
Excuse me?

10:05.704 --> 10:07.738
How else is he getting
this information?

10:07.739 --> 10:11.041
Wait a minute.
You might be right.

10:11.042 --> 10:12.876
What's up, doc?

10:14.713 --> 10:18.148
No, not tonight.
You-know-who's gonna be here.

10:18.149 --> 10:21.586
Do you actually think
that's funny?
Yes.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.757
Honey, he's stealing
all my lighting ideas.

10:26.758 --> 10:30.695
Tim, you really think
doc johnson has nothing better
to do than spy on you?

10:30.696 --> 10:34.665
He's a retired proctologist.
Spying on us is a lot more fun
than what he used to do.

10:37.569 --> 10:38.669
What is that?

10:38.670 --> 10:40.971
It's rudolf's nose.

10:44.209 --> 10:46.944
I don't even wanna see
the rest of him.

10:46.945 --> 10:48.312
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:50.014 --> 10:52.283
Dad.
What is it?

10:52.284 --> 10:56.487
I think
I know where doc johnson's
been getting his information.

10:56.488 --> 11:00.758
Me too. I think it's your mom.
She's a double agent.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.025
No.

11:02.026 --> 11:05.129
He's been getting
his information from me.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.565
Wait a minute.
Say that again.

11:07.566 --> 11:11.669
Well, you see, I was
talking to doc johnson's
granddaughter, lauren,

11:11.670 --> 11:14.204
And I kind of mentioned
a few things.

11:14.205 --> 11:16.240
I can't believe
you'd do that.

11:16.241 --> 11:20.411
You know there's
no secret more important than
a family's lighting strategy.

11:20.412 --> 11:23.381
She's really cute.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.783
She kept pumping me
for information.

11:25.784 --> 11:28.886
No matter how hard
I tried to resist,
I couldn't.

11:28.887 --> 11:30.688
Mmm.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.222
Been there.

11:35.994 --> 11:37.928
She smile at you like this?

11:39.531 --> 11:42.933

I would've thrown up.

12:02.321 --> 12:03.854
I know. I'm not going.

I'm not going.

I'm not.

You two, you go out and wait
in the car, all right?

12:11.296 --> 12:14.432
Brad, what do you mean
you're not going?

12:14.433 --> 12:18.502
Well, if I can't go skiing,
I don't see why I have to
go to church.

12:18.503 --> 12:21.739
Because god said,
"come and worship,"
not, "go and slalom."

12:24.843 --> 12:28.546
Honey, you can't stay home.
Mark's gonna sing tonight.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.013
So?

12:30.014 --> 12:33.317
So get up and
get dressed for church.
Be down in five minutes.

12:33.318 --> 12:36.821
Because mom wants
the whole stupid family
to be together?

12:36.822 --> 12:38.689
If that's your attitude,
stay home.

12:38.690 --> 12:41.058
No. Don't let him off
that easy.

12:41.059 --> 12:45.162
If he's gonna be obnoxious,
I'd just as soon he didn't
ruin christmas eve for us.

12:45.163 --> 12:47.765
You've already ruined it
for me.
Well, I am so sorry.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.600
Stay in your room.

12:49.601 --> 12:52.670
No sneaking downstairs
to watch that
<i>tool time</i> marathon.

You look wonderful.
Merry christmas.

13:05.684 --> 13:08.051
Thank you, tim.
Same to you.

13:08.052 --> 13:11.355
Tim, I've never
seen you at church
without your earplug.

13:11.356 --> 13:13.957
No football game
on tonight?

13:13.958 --> 13:16.093
That was one Sunday,
all right, reverend.

13:16.094 --> 13:18.195
I-I-I pray
during halftime.

13:18.196 --> 13:19.864
Yeah, I remember
that prayer.

13:19.865 --> 13:23.768
"o heavenly father,
please let the lions kick butt."

13:23.769 --> 13:26.970
Mark, maybe you should
change into your robe.

13:26.971 --> 13:28.972
Do I have to?
I look like a geek.

13:28.973 --> 13:31.742
Oh, honey,
you look great.
For a geek.

13:35.647 --> 13:38.215
Reverend, the lights look
a little dim on the tree.

13:38.216 --> 13:40.117
I could boost the power,
get some lights for the service.

13:40.118 --> 13:42.553
No. No, thank you,
tim.

13:42.554 --> 13:44.588
I don't think tonight
is the night

13:44.589 --> 13:47.792
To test our new
sprinkler system.

13:47.793 --> 13:50.027
Where's brad
this evening?
Oh, boy...

13:50.028 --> 13:52.730
He's not feeling well.
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

13:52.731 --> 13:56.400
Well, maybe we'll see
all the taylors together
next christmas.

13:56.401 --> 13:58.201
"not feeling well"?

13:58.202 --> 14:00.771
You lied in church
on christmas eve?

14:02.340 --> 14:05.175
Watch out for lightning bolts.
God doesn't like that stuff.

14:05.176 --> 14:07.210
At least I'm not begging
the almighty

14:07.211 --> 14:09.780
For two touchdowns
and a field goal.

14:09.781 --> 14:11.916
Merry christmas.
Hi, al.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.984
Merry christmas.
Merry christmas.

14:13.985 --> 14:17.321
Here, scooch over.
Don't crowd.
I'll take a pew behind you.

14:17.322 --> 14:19.490
Most people
use the bathroom, al.

14:24.930 --> 14:25.930
Where's ilene?

14:25.931 --> 14:28.599
She had
an orthodontic emergency

14:28.600 --> 14:31.068
At the junior-high
christmas play.

14:31.069 --> 14:34.338
Joseph and mary got their
braces stuck together.

14:34.339 --> 14:36.874
I hope she gets here in time
to see mark.

14:36.875 --> 14:41.612
I just saw him down the hall
in his... His little robe.

14:41.613 --> 14:44.448
Boy, you know,
I always wanted to be
the letter "n."

14:46.417 --> 14:50.253
That's impossible, al.
The song specifically
says "no al."

14:56.227 --> 14:58.696
♪ no al, no al

14:58.697 --> 15:01.398

15:04.870 --> 15:07.270
Well, where's bradley?

15:07.271 --> 15:09.907
He's spending christmas eve
alone in his room sulking.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.109
It's his way
of rebelling.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.978
Oh, yeah, well...

15:13.979 --> 15:17.615
I remember my first
christmas rebellion.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.483
I was so mad.

15:19.484 --> 15:23.453
My parents went out and bought
an artificial tree.

15:23.454 --> 15:28.058
The whole christmas
I refused to sing
"o tannenbaum."

15:29.628 --> 15:31.795
Oh, my.

15:31.796 --> 15:35.399
You were a bad,
bad borland.

15:38.136 --> 15:40.337
You all right?
Yeah, I'm ok.

15:43.107 --> 15:45.042
It was a long time ago.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.414
I mean, are you ok?

15:50.415 --> 15:54.117
No. Mark's singing.
It's christmas.

15:54.118 --> 15:56.720
I want the whole family
to be together.

15:56.721 --> 15:59.056
Why'd you make brad
stay home?

15:59.057 --> 16:02.026
I'd have loved
to drag him here
against his will.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.127
That's a great vision
for christmas -

16:04.128 --> 16:08.065
The four of us singing hymns,
you with brad in a headlock.

16:08.066 --> 16:12.803
It just
doesn't seem like christmas
without us all being together.

16:18.509 --> 16:20.878
Excuse me.
Where are you going?

16:20.879 --> 16:23.513
Off to the little boys' room
to take a pew.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.528
Jeez, dad, what are you
doing here?

16:38.529 --> 16:42.833
I came home to get you.
My question is, what are you
doing with the skis?

16:42.834 --> 16:45.268
Uh, I... I was gonna
donate 'em to the needy.

16:45.269 --> 16:51.075
Yeah. Yeah, that's
just what they need down there
at the mission. Food and skis.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.543
Look, dad, I explained it all
in the note.

16:53.544 --> 16:55.946
Well, it better
be a good one.

17:00.018 --> 17:02.987
"went skiing. Brad."

17:02.988 --> 17:05.521
Your mom and I
specifically said
you don't go skiing,

17:05.522 --> 17:07.523
And you were gonna
disobey us.

17:07.525 --> 17:09.492
I wasn't disobeying you.

17:09.493 --> 17:11.795
You said I couldn't
go with the wheelers,
and I'm not.

17:11.796 --> 17:14.498
Well, how are you gonna
get there?
Hitchhike.

17:14.499 --> 17:16.500
Hitchhike?
Sit down over here.

17:16.501 --> 17:18.801
All I wanted to do
was be with my friends.

17:18.803 --> 17:21.438
A lot of people I like
are gonna be down there.

17:21.439 --> 17:24.742
Christmas is not about
being with people you like!

17:26.344 --> 17:29.713
It's about being with
your family.

17:31.549 --> 17:34.852
Dad, it's just one christmas.
It's not that big a deal.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.954
Well, it is to your mom
and to me and to me.

17:41.626 --> 17:44.828
I can't believe
you'd be this selfish.

17:44.829 --> 17:47.364
Listen to me. Um...

17:47.365 --> 17:49.366
In a couple years,
you'll be 18.

17:49.367 --> 17:52.369
You'll be off to college...
Or a good trade school.

17:54.172 --> 17:55.973
And we won't see you.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.876
But, dad, I'll come home.

17:58.877 --> 18:01.879
You'll come a couple
christmases. But then you'll get
married, and I'll never see you.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.883
Your mom's family lives
in texas, mine's in colorado.
We never see them for holidays.

18:05.884 --> 18:10.087
You don't know how many
christmases we have together.
I won't be around forever.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.889
What do you mean?

18:11.890 --> 18:13.724
Face the facts.

18:13.725 --> 18:15.726
You've seen the stunts
I pull on <i>tool time.</i>

18:15.727 --> 18:17.661
I can't keep
dodging the bullet.

18:19.497 --> 18:22.465
I gotta get back to church
and see your brother sing.

18:22.466 --> 18:26.436
You can sit here and think about
what a merry christmas
you've made this.

18:40.852 --> 18:43.754
Well, I checked in every
stall in the bathroom -

18:43.755 --> 18:46.323
Men's and women's.

18:46.324 --> 18:48.525
Boy, was mrs. Lindsay
surprised.

18:48.526 --> 18:52.295
I wonder where he is.

18:52.296 --> 18:55.532
Maybe he decided to go home
and set up his christmas lights.

18:55.533 --> 18:59.369
You really think he'd
rather set up the lights
than hear mark sing?

18:59.370 --> 19:01.138
What was I thinking?

19:11.983 --> 19:13.283
Who's leon?

19:14.886 --> 19:18.688
Maybe leon was born
in the manger next door.
