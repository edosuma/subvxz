or any year ever.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.717
Wait, you've never paid
your taxes?

09:51.719 --> 09:53.819
No, I've never <i>filed</i> my taxes.

09:53.821 --> 09:56.004
I've paid taxes.
I see it on my check.

09:56.006 --> 09:59.641
$8 to the state,
15 in federal income,

09:59.643 --> 10:03.228
6.23 to Fica,
whoever that lucky bitch is.

10:03.230 --> 10:06.348
Max, why didn't you tell me
the severity of this last night?

10:06.350 --> 10:09.401
Um, maybe you haven't noticed,
but I have issues around money.

10:09.403 --> 10:11.870
Every year,
I say I'm going to file,

10:11.872 --> 10:13.989
and then I put it off
and put it off

10:13.991 --> 10:15.741
until the day it's due,
like today,

10:15.743 --> 10:18.160
and then I sit down
with a 1040 and my W-2s,

10:18.162 --> 10:19.545
and right around
the fourth question,

10:19.547 --> 10:21.046
I'm like, screw it!

10:21.048 --> 10:23.599
I'm gonna watch old <i>soul train</i>
clips on YouTube before work.

10:23.601 --> 10:26.585
And then I feel like a loser
until tax day is over.

10:26.587 --> 10:28.387
And then I'm like,
who cares? I'm awesome.

10:28.389 --> 10:29.972
I'll do them next year.

10:29.974 --> 10:32.391
So what you're telling me

10:32.393 --> 10:35.043
is your finances are as messy
as your purse.

10:35.045 --> 10:37.379
Careful now!

10:37.381 --> 10:39.148
Starting to get a little hot
up in here.

10:39.150 --> 10:40.733
Fine, I don't care.

10:40.735 --> 10:42.551
I just want you
to get your taxes done.

10:42.553 --> 10:44.570
Now throw away
all of your useless garbage

10:44.572 --> 10:46.071
into this trash can.

10:46.073 --> 10:49.224
You know what, I'm just gonna
go to that pop-up tax place

10:49.226 --> 10:50.859
near the diner.

10:50.861 --> 10:53.412
And I'll throw my "useless
garbage" in the dumpster

10:53.414 --> 10:54.863
on the way out.

10:54.865 --> 10:56.231
Wait, you're gonna spend
like $100

10:56.233 --> 10:58.200
to have someone do your taxes

10:58.202 --> 10:59.418
when I'm sitting right here.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.420
The amount of money
I'll spend down there

11:01.422 --> 11:03.088
is nothing compared
to the amount of money

11:03.090 --> 11:05.707
I'd have to spend on weed
to survive doing taxes with you.

11:05.709 --> 11:08.594
[Knock at door]

11:08.596 --> 11:10.846
- Good afternoon, girls.
- Hello.

11:10.848 --> 11:13.081
I hope Sophie and I's
wild lovemaking

11:13.083 --> 11:15.801
didn't keep you up all night.

11:15.803 --> 11:17.136
We wanted to come down

11:17.138 --> 11:19.888
and show you the gift
I just gave Sophie.

11:19.890 --> 11:23.142
Yeah, look, girls.
Look at my gift.

11:23.144 --> 11:26.361
It's got a leg.

11:26.363 --> 11:28.897
Wow, I didn't think you two
were the couple type.

11:28.899 --> 11:30.399
We are going into Manhattan

11:30.401 --> 11:32.100
for fruit cocktail
and champagne.

11:32.102 --> 11:33.935
- Want to join?
- Hell, yeah!

11:33.937 --> 11:36.238
No, Max,
you're doing your taxes.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.956
Oh. My mother says
I can't come out.

11:37.958 --> 11:41.043
Have fun.

11:42.662 --> 11:45.130
This means nothing!

11:47.917 --> 11:50.419
I can't believe you're putting
your financial future

11:50.421 --> 11:52.421
into the hands of a hipster
tax place

11:52.423 --> 11:54.423
called "The Tax of Life."

11:54.425 --> 11:56.475
You know
how the old proverb goes.

11:56.477 --> 11:58.177
"You take the good,
you take the bad.

11:58.179 --> 12:02.147
You take what's left, and there
you have the tax of life."

12:03.349 --> 12:06.485
43! Number 43.

12:06.487 --> 12:08.403
And remember,
if you need any help,

12:08.405 --> 12:09.822
I'm acquainted
with your finances.

12:09.824 --> 12:11.857
And I'm acquainted
with your attitude.

12:11.859 --> 12:14.092
Don't say a word.

12:14.094 --> 12:16.195
- I'm 43.
- 'Sup, 43?

12:16.197 --> 12:19.114
I'm Kyle.
I'm your tax bro.

12:19.116 --> 12:22.534
Hi, I'm Max and this is
my mute friend Caroline.

12:22.536 --> 12:24.819
I already started
to fill out the 1040

12:24.821 --> 12:26.488
and I have my W-2s
from this year.

12:26.490 --> 12:27.822
Also some receipts.

12:27.824 --> 12:30.792
Well, let's get started!

12:30.794 --> 12:32.928
Do you have a health savings
account?

12:32.930 --> 12:36.348
- Definitely not.
- Oh, well, we can fudge that.

12:36.350 --> 12:39.852
- I'll put you down for 500.
- Sounds good.

12:39.854 --> 12:41.687
Fudge that? Fudge?

12:41.689 --> 12:43.522
I wasn't aware
there was fudging in finance.

12:43.524 --> 12:46.391
Domestic production activities.

12:46.393 --> 12:50.512
- Like condoms and stuff?
- I guess.

12:50.514 --> 12:53.565
Talk about adjusted
gross income, am I right?

12:53.567 --> 12:55.150
[Laughing] Am I right?

12:55.152 --> 12:57.286
Kyle, put me down for 250.

12:57.288 --> 12:58.620
250.

12:58.622 --> 13:01.823
Should I just put the cheese
plate out for the IRS now?

13:01.825 --> 13:04.326
What about residential
energy credits?

13:04.328 --> 13:06.578
I bought some of those
curly light bulbs once.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.631
Oh, that's another 150 easily.

13:09.633 --> 13:12.033
Sorry, Max,
I can't stop myself.

13:12.035 --> 13:13.969
Money, finances--
this is my thing.

13:13.971 --> 13:15.837
If we were at a copper-plated
jewelry sale,

13:15.839 --> 13:17.389
I'd let you take the wheel.

13:17.391 --> 13:20.809
I can't sit back and watch you
risk our financial future.

13:20.811 --> 13:23.545
You'll be dragging me into this
with you and your tax bro.

13:23.547 --> 13:26.214
Excuse me, tax bro.

13:26.216 --> 13:29.401
Oh, my God, you wanna claim
a residential energy credit?

13:29.403 --> 13:32.688
You don't even have a 5695
up here.

13:32.690 --> 13:36.891
Hey, your mute friend's
all over this.

13:36.893 --> 13:38.577
You should let her
do your taxes.

13:38.579 --> 13:40.412
She's way better.

13:40.414 --> 13:42.698
No, that's cool, Kyle.
I'm not gonna do this.

13:42.700 --> 13:43.699
One more year won't kill me.

13:43.701 --> 13:45.667
I'll just
spend this money on pot.

13:45.669 --> 13:49.054
That's an entertainment
expense, bee-tee-Dubbs.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.125
Max, don't give up yet.
Let me help.

13:53.127 --> 13:54.927
Look, it's already 9:00.
We ran out of time.

13:54.929 --> 13:57.346
At least take a form
and file an extension.

13:57.348 --> 13:59.348
The post office
is open till midnight.

13:59.350 --> 14:01.583
Max, you know you wanna change
your finances.

14:01.585 --> 14:02.684
It's a step.

14:02.686 --> 14:04.586
You're right.
Good idea.

14:04.588 --> 14:06.221
They have extension forms
at the post office.

14:06.223 --> 14:09.924
We can pick one up
when I drop off Earl's return.

14:09.926 --> 14:11.727
- What?
- It's not here.

14:11.729 --> 14:12.861
It's not in my purse.

14:12.863 --> 14:14.947
Last time I saw it,
it was on the coffee table

14:14.949 --> 14:17.032
before you came in
with all your tax stuff.

14:17.034 --> 14:18.367
It must still be there.

14:18.369 --> 14:20.869
Uh, no, you made me throw
all that stuff out.

14:20.871 --> 14:23.705
You threw out
a 75-year-old man's tax return?

14:23.707 --> 14:25.407
You threw some papers out too.

14:25.409 --> 14:26.875
This is so not like me.

14:26.877 --> 14:30.412
The only thing I've ever lost
is my virginity.

14:30.414 --> 14:31.997
What are we gonna do?

14:31.999 --> 14:33.948
No, it's okay. Relax.
No big deal.

14:33.950 --> 14:36.585
We just have to go home
and climb through the dumpster.

14:36.587 --> 14:40.305
No, seriously,
what are we gonna do?

14:40.307 --> 14:41.956
Ready?

14:41.958 --> 14:44.793
No, seriously,
what are we gonna do?

14:46.000 --> 14:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:53.194 --> 14:54.361
Well, let's get to it.

14:54.363 --> 14:56.663
My garbage
ain't gonna find itself.

14:56.665 --> 14:57.864
Max, I can't.

14:57.866 --> 15:01.618
If I go in there,
I will literally be white trash.

15:01.620 --> 15:04.821
Look, you're the one
who had to butt in

15:04.823 --> 15:06.339
and get all "Wharton" with Earl.

15:06.341 --> 15:07.707
If you had left him alone,

15:07.709 --> 15:09.826
it would be at the post office
safe and sound.

15:09.828 --> 15:11.177
Fine.

15:11.179 --> 15:12.762
But to be clear,
if we find a baby in there,

15:12.764 --> 15:14.598
you're raising it on your own.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.850
Hey, it's already off
to a better start than I had.

15:16.852 --> 15:19.436
There's food everywhere.

15:19.438 --> 15:21.271
[Sigh]
[Garbage truck backing up]

15:21.273 --> 15:23.356
Oh, hell, no!
It's Tuesday--trash pick up!

15:23.358 --> 15:24.691
Better get in and out

15:24.693 --> 15:26.977
or we'll be on a garbage barge
to coney island.

15:26.979 --> 15:28.311
Come on,
I'll give you ten fingers.

15:28.313 --> 15:31.231
My shoes.
My dignity.

15:31.233 --> 15:34.017
My shoes.

15:34.019 --> 15:37.186
My hands are touching
a dumpster.

15:37.188 --> 15:38.622
All right,
on the count of three,

15:38.624 --> 15:40.123
I'll push,
you hoist yourself up.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.825
But really pull yourself up,
or you won't make it.

15:41.827 --> 15:44.461
It's hell.
I'm looking into hell.

15:44.463 --> 15:47.914
1...2...3!

15:47.916 --> 15:49.799
Whaa!

15:54.972 --> 15:58.808
I wanted to scream,
but it wouldn't come out.

15:58.810 --> 16:00.927
Okay, well, good luck.
See ya.

16:00.929 --> 16:02.429
- Max!
- I'm kidding!

16:02.431 --> 16:04.881
I'm coming around the back.
I found a place to get a leg up.

16:04.883 --> 16:09.769
Now?
You just saw that now?

16:09.771 --> 16:11.571
Aah!

16:11.573 --> 16:13.606
Why'd you scream?
You knew it was me.

16:13.608 --> 16:16.776
That's the one
I couldn't get out before.

16:16.778 --> 16:19.779
Oh, God, look at this mess.

16:19.781 --> 16:21.748
It's like looking for
a dirty needle in a haystack,

16:21.750 --> 16:24.117
which I've done.

16:24.119 --> 16:27.337
Okay, start poking around.
Look for familiar garbage.

16:27.339 --> 16:30.239
"Familiar garbage"?

16:30.241 --> 16:33.376
I hate it in here.
I wanna die.

16:33.378 --> 16:34.678
It's not that bad.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.013
My mom and I once spent
five hours in a dumpster

16:37.015 --> 16:39.549
looking for proof that her
boyfriend was cheating on her,

16:39.551 --> 16:42.302
and all we found was
a scratch-off worth a $1.50

16:42.304 --> 16:43.803
and a beach towel.

16:43.805 --> 16:45.605
And then, we used that $1.50

16:45.607 --> 16:47.724
to take the towel
to the laundromat.

16:47.726 --> 16:50.143
12 years later,
you and I use that very towel

16:50.145 --> 16:53.646
to dry ourselves off
after a shower.

16:53.648 --> 16:58.068
Well, I'm standing on
a stranger's cold sesame noodles

16:58.070 --> 17:00.153
with egg shells
stuck to my ankles.

17:00.155 --> 17:01.654
You win, Max.

17:01.656 --> 17:03.606
What does that have to do
with me?

17:03.608 --> 17:08.078
It means I'm officially
standing in your purse.

17:08.079 --> 17:13.333
How about more real garbage,
less Caroline garbage?

17:13.335 --> 17:15.551
Caroline garbage?

17:15.554 --> 17:17.286
You have been dumping
on me all day.

17:17.288 --> 17:18.887
Me? What have I done?

17:18.890 --> 17:22.509
"Max, you didn't file...<i>ever?"</i>

17:22.511 --> 17:24.560
I didn't say it like that.

17:24.563 --> 17:27.230
And you didn't file ever.
Is that my fault?

17:27.232 --> 17:29.632
Yes! This is all your fault.

17:29.634 --> 17:32.318
Before I met you, I didn't
even think about a future.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.572
Now I have a future,
and I'm standing in a dumpster!

17:35.574 --> 17:39.275
You are not the only one
standing in a dumpster.

17:39.277 --> 17:41.494
And...get a new purse.

17:41.496 --> 17:43.279
If you had been able
to find a stupid stamp

17:43.281 --> 17:44.647
in that horrid thing,

17:44.649 --> 17:46.833
I would've never even seen
Earl's taxes

17:46.835 --> 17:48.668
and I wouldn't be standing
in a dumpster.

18:00.965 --> 18:02.331
Max, no, no, no!

18:02.333 --> 18:04.500
I will never, ever
recover from that!

18:04.502 --> 18:06.770
Red bulls? Red bulls?
Are those our red bulls?

18:06.772 --> 18:07.854
Where?

18:07.856 --> 18:09.839
Yes! Yes!
That's my garbage!

18:09.841 --> 18:11.775
That's my garbage!
Get over here!

18:11.777 --> 18:13.026
If we find it,
we'll have enough time

18:13.028 --> 18:14.861
to shower and get to
the post office.

18:14.863 --> 18:17.847
Both: Earl's taxes!
Earl's taxes!

18:18.682 --> 18:21.451
Next!

18:21.453 --> 18:22.902
This is unbelievable.

18:22.904 --> 18:25.371
Everyone trying to get their
taxes filed by midnight.

18:25.373 --> 18:28.491
Wow, I haven't seen this much
last-minute licking

18:28.493 --> 18:31.744
since the cops raided
that Thai massage parlor.

18:31.746 --> 18:34.464
- I'll grab an extension form.
- You get in line.

18:34.466 --> 18:36.332
The line's longer
than I expected.

18:36.334 --> 18:40.170
No, we have to file.
She's nursing.

18:40.172 --> 18:41.921
Don't worry.
We're fine.

18:41.923 --> 18:43.890
I'm a bum.

18:43.892 --> 18:47.376
She's got a baby hanging off her
nipple and her taxes are done.

18:47.378 --> 18:49.846
Max, you can't compare
yourself to other people.

18:49.848 --> 18:51.214
You'll do it your way.

18:51.216 --> 18:54.517
And there's a blind guy.

18:54.519 --> 18:57.270
No eyes, taxes done.

18:57.272 --> 19:00.406
I guess he wasn't distracted
by YouTube clips.

19:00.408 --> 19:02.025
Don't be so hard on yourself.

19:02.027 --> 19:04.110
You're filing an extension,
and then you'll get them done.

19:04.112 --> 19:06.412
You say I'm going to file,
but will I?

19:06.414 --> 19:09.115
I say I'm going to clean out
my purse, but do I?

19:09.117 --> 19:12.702
Sophie says she's gonna
tell Oleg, but did she?

19:12.704 --> 19:14.587
An extension
is just another excuse

19:14.589 --> 19:17.073
for me to put it off
and create a bigger mess.

19:17.075 --> 19:20.093
Hey, Max.
What's up?

19:20.095 --> 19:23.012
Bob.
Wow, what are you doing here?

19:23.014 --> 19:25.932
Oh, I just filed my taxes
like everyone else.

19:25.934 --> 19:27.884
Bob had a good year.
Ha.

19:28.802 --> 19:30.520
Who was that?

19:30.522 --> 19:33.306
My dealer.
Forget the extension.

19:33.308 --> 19:35.859
If my pot dealer can file,
I can file.

19:35.861 --> 19:37.260
We still have half an hour.

19:37.262 --> 19:38.594
Run home and get my W-2s

19:38.596 --> 19:40.063
while I stay in line
and fill out the 1040.

19:40.065 --> 19:41.698
Maybe I should stay
and fill it out,

19:41.700 --> 19:42.949
and you can run home.

19:42.951 --> 19:44.117
No, I have to do this.

19:44.119 --> 19:45.485
Don't worry, if I get stumped,

19:45.487 --> 19:46.953
I'm surrounded
by procrastinators.

19:46.955 --> 19:48.905
One of them will help...
Eventually.

19:48.907 --> 19:50.406
Okay, here's a pen.

19:50.408 --> 19:51.541
I'm gonna go drop off
Earl's return in the slot,

19:51.543 --> 19:52.825
and I'll be back
as soon as I can.

19:52.827 --> 19:53.993
Okay.

19:53.995 --> 19:55.295
Uh, hi, can you hold my place

19:55.297 --> 19:56.746
while I get a tax form
for this year?

19:56.748 --> 19:59.132
Oh, cutting it close.
You're worse than me.

19:59.134 --> 20:01.834
- Go, I got your back.
- And she's got your front.

20:05.256 --> 20:07.290
So I add up all these lines
and put the total here?

20:07.292 --> 20:08.758
- Right.
- What about student loans?

20:08.760 --> 20:10.260
Yes, and I paid mine off
this year.

20:10.262 --> 20:11.511
Then claim it.

20:11.513 --> 20:13.062
That interest
is a huge write off.

20:13.064 --> 20:15.064
Put down $436 on line 33.

20:15.066 --> 20:18.234
- Post office is closing!
All: No!

20:18.236 --> 20:19.652
My friend just texted me.
She's almost here.

20:19.654 --> 20:21.538
Please,
I have to file this year.

20:21.540 --> 20:23.606
Midnight is midnight!

20:23.608 --> 20:25.325
All: Boo!

20:25.327 --> 20:27.944
Oh, please,
I have six children at home.

20:27.946 --> 20:29.245
This is nothing.

20:29.247 --> 20:31.614
Here! I'm here, I'm here!
What time is it?

20:31.616 --> 20:34.817
30 seconds.

20:34.819 --> 20:36.419
Make room, make room.

20:36.421 --> 20:39.822
Stapler, stapler.

20:39.824 --> 20:42.542
- 10...
- Sign it! Sign your 1040!

20:42.544 --> 20:43.826
- 9...
- Where?

20:43.828 --> 20:47.096
[Crowd shouting encouragement]
8...7...

20:47.098 --> 20:48.881
6...
Fold! Fold, you bastard!

20:48.883 --> 20:51.517
5...4...

20:51.519 --> 20:53.669
3...

20:53.671 --> 20:56.672
2...

20:56.674 --> 20:57.724
No stamp.

20:57.726 --> 20:59.976
- What?
Crowd: Aw!

21:02.012 --> 21:04.731
It's cool.
I got ya, boo.

21:05.783 --> 21:08.117
I did it!
I filed my taxes!

21:08.119 --> 21:10.353
[Cheers and applause]

21:10.355 --> 21:12.658
Everybody can suck it!
