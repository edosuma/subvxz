Now,
Jimmy over there has shared

Agh! Honey, you're like
the Kid Whisperer. Right?

were clapping. Mmm.

02:38.192 --> 02:41.927
Babe. I had plans
for us this weekend.

02:41.929 --> 02:46.398
<i>I bought a new suit.
I was gonna give you
some Ebony Elegance.</i>

02:46.400 --> 02:49.168
No. We have been
through this. This is
a non-negotiable with Daddy.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.436
It's Moby Dick Day.
I have to go.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.173
Okay, you know
how crazy that sounds, right?

02:54.175 --> 02:57.442
Yes. But it's the whole town.
We all get together.

02:57.444 --> 03:01.747
We recite from the novel.
We bless the fishermen.
It's a whole thing.

03:01.749 --> 03:05.317
So if it's Big Dick Day,
why aren't I going?
Shouldn't I be there?

03:05.319 --> 03:07.519
I didn't say it was big.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.222
So it's Little Dick Day.
You're going all the way
out there for little...

03:10.224 --> 03:11.823
Okay. You have to stop.
I'm telling you,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.425
you would not like it.
It's boring,

03:13.427 --> 03:14.626
it's cold, it's...

03:14.628 --> 03:16.361
Grace! It's been a year.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.663
It's time I met your folks.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.366
You get that
little eyebrow thing

03:21.368 --> 03:23.268
when you're mad at me.
It's very cute.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.204
No. No. Stop.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.738
And it makes you
very much delicious.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.841
No. I'm not making
sweet precious love
to you

03:29.843 --> 03:31.810
until you share
the Chocolate Kennedys.

03:36.449 --> 03:38.884

03:38.886 --> 03:40.852
I don't like it when
you say that, Wade!

03:40.854 --> 03:42.588
This is about your dad.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.922
What about him?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.490
You empower him.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.726
No, I confer.

03:47.728 --> 03:51.663
I confer with him.
He's a Federal judge.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.800
{SCOFFS} You're a lawyer
with the United Nations.

03:54.802 --> 03:58.270
But you need a permission
slip signed by Daddy
so I can be your man.

How are you gonna
use the safe word?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.245
I can't come
against the safe word.

04:06.247 --> 04:10.882
You agreed to the safe word.
"Peanuts" means end
of discussion. Yes?

04:10.884 --> 04:11.750
But we talked...

04:25.666 --> 04:27.432
What?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.001
I will be back
before you know it.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.569
Mmm-hmm.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.937
And do you know why?

04:35.708 --> 04:36.875
Because I love you.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.616
Wanna take me to the jitney?

04:46.653 --> 04:47.653
Sure.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.778
Doctor, how is Amanda?

05:12.780 --> 05:15.747
Unfortunately,
Amanda suffered
quite a lot of damage.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.516
I'm gonna need to keep her
for about a week.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.817
Agh!

05:18.819 --> 05:21.420
I hate this part of my job.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.889
Here's my card.
Call me if you need

05:26.392 --> 05:27.993

Amanda for surgery. Nurse.

What are you doing here?

05:41.508 --> 05:44.776
Ah. Just came, you know,
hang out, see what you want
to do this weekend.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.780
Hang out? What about Grace?
Thought Saturday was
the big proposal day.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.850
{GROANS} She's away at
Sag Harbor with her family.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.719
Without you?

05:53.721 --> 05:56.054
Yeah. You know,
no big deal. Whatever.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.490
So what are you supposed
to do this weekend,

05:58.492 --> 06:01.827
just sit there looking stupid
with Grandma's ring
sitting in your pocket?

06:01.829 --> 06:03.528
How did you know
it was in my pocket?

06:03.530 --> 06:05.697
Because it's been there
for the last three months.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.666
Look, I love Grace.
You know I love Grace.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.968
But this is some
highly suspect shit!

06:09.970 --> 06:11.703
Why is everything
about betrayal with you?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.672
You know what?
You never got over

06:13.674 --> 06:15.374
seeing Mom in bed
with Mr. Andy.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.142
Don't talk about Mr. Andy.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.011
Okay? I had to
watch my troop leader
doing very unspeakable acts

06:20.013 --> 06:22.681
while wearing
my merit sash.
That's not right.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.950
Look, answer me this.
What are you supposed to do?

06:24.952 --> 06:26.885
I don't know, man.
All right.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.454
You're gonna postpone
your wedding
proposal yet again,

06:29.456 --> 06:31.590
all for the sake
of big dog Daddy.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.891
I mean, the power
distribution is way off.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.164
It's like she
can't make a move
without Daddy, you know?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.500
She puts him on
some kind of pedestal.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.668
On a freaking
pedestal, man.

06:43.670 --> 06:44.836
Look, you are just
as good as him.

06:44.838 --> 06:45.937
Mmm-hmm.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.106
I mean,
maybe not as good,

06:48.108 --> 06:50.108
because he's a Federal judge,
and you sing songs
about urine to minors,

06:50.110 --> 06:51.877
but people love you.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.414
People do love me.
You're right.

06:56.616 --> 06:57.582
Maybe I should
just go out there.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.717
Go!

06:59.786 --> 07:01.153
Meet the family.
Yeah.

07:01.155 --> 07:02.187
They love me.
I love them.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.922
Black love.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.657
I pick
the perfect time
to propose

07:05.659 --> 07:07.559
in front of
Daddy and everybody.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.961
That's what's up.
Okay? That sets the tone.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.630
Handle your business,
big bro.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.831
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.933
Bro, but wait, man.
Can we talk, man?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.701
You can't just
bring up Mr. Andy

07:16.703 --> 07:18.837
and then walk away.
That's just...

07:18.839 --> 07:20.605
There is no merit badge
for what they were doing.

Here you go.

I'm trying to get to
Judge Peeples' house.
Can you take me?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.244
That's a private road.
The closest you're
gonna get is on that.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.844
I'm Gloria, Grace's sister.

11:19.846 --> 11:24.249
Of course! I watch...
We watch you all
the time on CNN.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.252
Cool. This is my friend,
Meg. She's the reason
you can watch me.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.021
Hey, I'm
the camerawoman.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.724
{CHUCKLES} Wow.
Grace has told me
so much about all of you.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.229
Where's Simon?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.231
Simon!
Grace...

11:40.233 --> 11:42.967
Additional trials
on the Cybotic helmet prove

11:42.969 --> 11:45.270
that instrument can
isolate thought commands,

11:45.272 --> 11:46.738
such as left,
right, stop, go...

11:46.740 --> 11:49.174
GRACE: Simon!

11:49.176 --> 11:53.178
...but can also pick
up on emotional states,
such as anger and anxiety.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.913
GRACE: Simon!

11:54.915 --> 11:57.782
Will any of this
help me to get laid? No.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.883
Just a minute!

12:00.319 --> 12:01.920
What?

12:01.922 --> 12:04.089
This is my
little brother, Simon.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.390
I'm 16.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.092
What's up, Si?

12:07.094 --> 12:07.959
SIMON: Yeah.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.263
Yeah. Okay. Si. All right.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.065
Yeah!

12:14.067 --> 12:16.134
So, I guess we
should get you settled.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.870
He's staying?

12:18.872 --> 12:21.072
Last jitney's
gone, Dad.
Be nice.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.941
Well, there's
several other options.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.744
There's a bed and breakfast
a couple of towns over.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.512
Yeah, I could
just get a hotel.
It's no problem.

12:27.514 --> 12:31.249
No, no, no.
That's ridiculous.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.217
Uh-oh.
{IMITATES WHIPPING}

12:32.219 --> 12:33.051
{CHUCKLES}

12:36.255 --> 12:38.289
Simon will come
down to get your bags

12:38.291 --> 12:40.091
to take you over
to the guesthouse.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.794
Because that's
where you're staying.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.162
Grace knows good and well
she didn't tell me about this.

12:45.397 --> 12:47.332
DAPHNE: Honey,
she can hear you.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.167
Okay, let's see
how you like it, hmm?

12:50.870 --> 12:52.937
Okay, very good.
Good. Yup.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.510
{CLEARS THROAT}

12:58.512 --> 12:59.344
{WHISPERING} Come on!

13:03.315 --> 13:04.449
Wow!
Yeah.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.383
That was interesting.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.018
What?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.286
They have no idea
who I am.
Who?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.921
Grace!

13:09.923 --> 13:11.790
Your mama, your daddy,
your sister, your dog.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.390
{SHUSHING}

13:13.492 --> 13:15.093
Hey!

13:15.095 --> 13:16.895
What's up?
Hey, Si.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.830
It's a pleasure, man.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.398
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, I'll get this for you.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.367
WADE: Oh, that's
a grown sexy
watch right there.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.036
Nice.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.071
You know.
{CHUCKLES}

13:27.073 --> 13:28.239
Thank you, Simon.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.874
Yeah, whatever. It's "Si."

13:31.877 --> 13:33.578
It's pretty obvious
to me your father does
not want me here,

13:33.580 --> 13:34.512
which messes up
my whole plan.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.281
What plan?

13:36.283 --> 13:37.982
What?
Never mind. Come here.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.317
No, baby, look...

13:41.086 --> 13:43.221
Maybe I should just go.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.924
No, no. You can't go.
If you go, you'll forever
be Wade the Quitter.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.458
It's fine.
We can do this.
We're a team.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.227
{SIGHS}

13:49.229 --> 13:50.428
{WHISPERING}
Whoa.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.896
Why are you
acting like we're on

13:51.898 --> 13:53.164
some commando
mission or something?

13:53.166 --> 13:55.133
This is just me
meeting your family.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.570
I know. Look, I'm sorry.
I just want you
to be comfortable.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.105
Comfortable?
You said this was
a weekend beach house.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.974
It is.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.010
Listen to me, okay?
These are some tips
for dealing with Daddy.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.912
Number one.

14:07.914 --> 14:11.449
Don't assume every
question is hostile.
Although most probably are.

14:11.451 --> 14:15.854
Number two. If he
touches on a subject
that is uncomfortable,

14:15.856 --> 14:18.489
don't look away.
Stay engaged.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.925
Look him dead in his eye.
Just tell him exactly
what he wants to hear.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.560
Are you serious right now?
Yes.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.494
Okay, you know
I believe in honesty.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.063
I do, too.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.031
Honey, all I'm saying is,

14:27.033 --> 14:29.200
think about
maybe what he might

14:29.202 --> 14:30.602
want you to say,
and then say that.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.071
{CHUCKLES}

14:33.073 --> 14:34.038
You're gonna be great.

14:47.586 --> 14:49.220
Thank you.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.222
You're welcome.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.124
Oh, let me get that
for you, Mr. Peeples.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.192
Judge.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.267
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.334
So, you live
in the city, Wade?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.170
Yes.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.505
Near Gracie's
new place?

15:07.507 --> 15:10.174
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Very close. Very close.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.609
DAPHNE: Oh, excellent.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.344
You know,
we were just there...

15:13.346 --> 15:15.446
When was it, Virgil?
Last month?

15:15.448 --> 15:17.081
Really?

15:17.083 --> 15:20.285
Yeah. Yeah. I think you
were in class or...

15:20.287 --> 15:25.223
Oh, good for you.
You know, I say never
ever stop learning. {CHUCKLES}

15:25.225 --> 15:27.992
My dream is to
earn a doctorate
in child psychology.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.294
So you have
a master's degree?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.496
No, no.

15:31.498 --> 15:35.700
I play music at kids' parties,
and I kind of fell
into giving them advice.

15:35.702 --> 15:39.570
Wade uses music
to help kids
express themselves.

15:39.572 --> 15:43.942
He helps them solve
emotional problems.
It's really amazing work.

15:43.944 --> 15:47.312
So you're not even licensed?

15:47.314 --> 15:50.315
{CHUCKLES} No.
That's why I call it
"kounseling" with a "K."

15:52.217 --> 15:54.285
Because the "K"
looks different.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.956
That's wonderful!
Oh, Wade, I'd love to
hear one of your songs.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.425
Ah, no.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.428
Mom, no, he just got here.
So don't...

16:03.430 --> 16:06.597
I'm sure he can handle it.
And I say "kan" with a "K."

16:06.599 --> 16:08.299
{ALL LAUGH}

16:08.301 --> 16:09.567
Good one,
Mr. Peeples.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.336
Judge.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.137
Come on, Wade.
Impress us.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.005
{CHUCKLING}

16:15.407 --> 16:16.607
All right. Okay.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.579
This is a little something.
It's not my best,

16:23.549 --> 16:26.718
but it's a song
about teaching kids
to express themselves

16:26.720 --> 16:29.587
rather than urinate on stuff.

16:31.256 --> 16:32.657
Sounds timeless.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.992
{WADE CLEARS THROAT}

16:33.994 --> 16:36.127
<i>¶¶ Speak it, don't leak it¶¶</i>

<i>¶¶ Don't keep¶¶

16:42.234 --> 16:45.737
<i>¶¶ Say it, don't spray it¶¶</i>

16:45.739 --> 16:48.706
You get it?
Because you say it
instead of spraying it.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.575
You talk
instead of urinating.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.277
<i>¶¶ That's how
the big kids play it</i>

16:53.279 --> 16:56.781

17:01.287 --> 17:03.254

just a little of that.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.136
It's really catchy.

Yo, yo, yo.
You want to pop
this bottle of bub?

17:20.272 --> 17:22.272
That is not "bub,"
and what are you
doing with that?

17:23.275 --> 17:24.442
It's Wade's.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.742
You went through
his stuff?

17:25.744 --> 17:27.612
Chill, Godzilla.
The bag was open.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.414
It's quite all right.
It's actually...

17:29.416 --> 17:31.783
If I may.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.452
I brought this for Daphne.
It's a thank you

17:34.454 --> 17:36.587
for welcoming me
into your home.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.756
Oh, Wade,
you shouldn't have.

Oh, my God.
It's a '96 Chateau d'Yquem.
{CHUCKLES}

17:45.498 --> 17:48.499
That was a good year.
That was a very good year.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.369
WADE: I'm so glad you like it.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.837
I'm sorry, Mom.
He doesn't know.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.139
Doesn't know what?

17:55.141 --> 17:56.207
She's in AA.

17:59.111 --> 17:59.844
Why didn't you tell me?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.347
Uh, I'll take that, honey.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.816
I got it.
I got it. I got it.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.417
Right. {LAUGHS}

18:06.419 --> 18:08.519
Okay.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.588
The kids can
have it with dinner.
It will be divine.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.123
Speaking of dinner,

18:12.125 --> 18:13.091
it's time to pick
up the lobsters.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.225
GRACE: Yes. Okay.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.760
I've got the bikes all ready.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.262
Unfortunately, Wade,
we do not have a spare,

18:18.264 --> 18:20.131
so you can stay here
and clean my dinghy.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.800
No, no.
Honey, take my trike.

18:24.336 --> 18:27.105
I'm gonna do
a little gardening.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.473
Gracie, help your
father at the market.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.141
Of course.

know us like that.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.646
{WHISPERING} You hid my stuff?
No.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.748
When they came, you hid it?
No!

18:37.750 --> 18:39.550
I was wondering,
because I got there,
and nothing was in its place.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.119
I was just organizing it.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.186
You organized it
right out of sight.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.354
Let's go
to the market.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.689
Let's go.
Let's go to the market.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.157
Let's go, Peeples!

18:50.195 --> 18:51.395
Think they got
fresh lobsters in today.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.898
Ah, I hope so.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.833
WADE: You know, I noticed
it looked like rain
on my way in here.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.838
What?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.707
GRACE: Uh, we don't say that.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.309
It's sort of
a family jinx thing.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.578
We never say it's
going to "you know,"

19:07.580 --> 19:10.314
because then it
definitely will.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.618
Sorry. It doesn't look
like rain. I take it back.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.720
You can't take it back,
Wade, because it's
already out there.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.188
Raincoats, everyone.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.291
No, no, no.
I take it back.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.426
I stand by my
reverse of the curse.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.794
All right?
It's not gonna rain.

19:26.798 --> 19:29.200
Rain-jinxed the whole weekend.

19:47.386 --> 19:50.721
These are beautiful.
Put them on ice for me.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.560
You getting some
dessert for us?

19:55.562 --> 19:56.561
GLORIA: Why not?
MEG: Mmm-hmm.

Skip.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.209
Hi.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.643
How are you?
I'm fantastic.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.212
Wow.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.379
Oh, this is my boyfriend,
Wade Walker.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.248

Nice to meet you.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.718
Yeah. Will I see
you at Moby Dick Day?

20:20.720 --> 20:21.986
Wouldn't miss it.
Okay. Good.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.287
I'll be right back, Wade.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.489
You a friend of
Virgil Peeples?

20:25.491 --> 20:26.724
No. We dated.

20:27.859 --> 20:28.960
You dated
Virgil Peeples?

20:28.962 --> 20:30.795
No, of course not.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.464
I was like,
"I didn't know you
got down like that."

20:33.466 --> 20:35.533
I dated Grace.
She was incredible.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.402
So passionate.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.738
Really hurt so good!
{CHUCKLES}

20:40.740 --> 20:42.673

Yeah. Little chocolate
drop right over there.
Mmm mmm mmm!

Hey! Martin!

still sour-graping.

I used to... Mmm mmm!

21:11.470 --> 21:12.703
You're blessed.

21:18.644 --> 21:19.844
Bananas?

21:19.846 --> 21:21.012
Is it ripe enough for you?

21:22.614 --> 21:23.514
Okay.

21:32.591 --> 21:33.557
WOMAN: Will I see you tonight?

21:34.693 --> 21:36.494
I'll be there.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.396
And you're sure
Daphne doesn't know?

21:38.398 --> 21:39.964
Doesn't have a clue.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.565
Could be fun
to include her.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.834
You're kidding, right?

21:43.836 --> 21:46.537
You have to ease
her into it, Virgil.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.307
Let's just keep this
between me and you.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.408
Don't be such a tight-ass.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.846
I'll see you tonight.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.361
Oh, shit.

22:12.531 --> 22:13.664
I don't have any money.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.399
What's the holdup?

22:15.401 --> 22:16.734
He doesn't have any money,
Mrs. Davis.

22:16.736 --> 22:17.968
Huh?

22:17.970 --> 22:20.838
He doesn't have
any money!

22:20.840 --> 22:25.343
Oh, how sad.
The colored boy
doesn't have any money.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.511
I know Where's the Beef
didn't just call
me "a colored boy."

22:31.950 --> 22:33.784
That's a lot of
walk-around money.

22:33.786 --> 22:34.952
You've probably
got Oprah dollars.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.654
Keep the change, Wade.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.689
It's not that
I don't have money.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.492
It's misplaced right now.
I don't know
what happened to it.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.428
It's probably on the...
I could have left my
wallet on the jitney.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.631
Damn.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.368
Well, they won't
help themselves.

22:53.638 --> 22:55.005
Hey, babe.
Hey.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.676
So, Skip was interesting.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.745
Yeah.
He's great, isn't he?

23:00.747 --> 23:03.714
So great.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.149
He said the craziest
thing, though.
What's that?

23:05.151 --> 23:06.884
He said that y'all
two used to date.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.419
Yeah. That's right.

23:08.421 --> 23:09.520
For real?
Yeah.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.724
Don't you think
you should have
said something to me?

23:13.726 --> 23:16.494
What... Do I know about
every single woman
that you've dated?

23:16.496 --> 23:17.895
No, you don't.
Okay.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.597
But if I had
dated Harriet Tubman,

23:19.599 --> 23:20.998
I probably would
have said something.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.033
If I was texting
Madam C.J. Walker.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.468
Wade...

23:24.470 --> 23:24.969
Or Shirley Chisholm.

23:30.675 --> 23:31.976
So this is about age?
Yeah.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.511
He is a brilliant doctor.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.745
I'm sure he is.
He probably gave

23:34.747 --> 23:36.680
Adam and Eve
their first physicals.

23:36.682 --> 23:41.051
Wow! An ageist.
I thought you were
more mature than that.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.486
I should be more mature?
Yeah.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.088
Like Martin?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.424
Who told you about Martin?

23:46.426 --> 23:49.860
Oh, I met Uncle Ben and
Bojangles up in there...
Oh. {CHUCKLES} Wow.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.662
...at the National Black
History Month Caucus.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.565
It was all up in there.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.468
All your little grandpa
exes came dancing up
out of the crypt.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.569

Who else you go
out with, Grace?

24:19.759 --> 24:21.125
Benjamin Banneker?
W.E.B. Du Bois?

24:21.127 --> 24:23.561
GRACE: Okay, Wade.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.464

Run, chickens, run!

24:34.506 --> 24:36.207
Hey, what does that mean?

24:36.209 --> 24:38.209
It's a thing that we've done
since we were kids.

24:38.211 --> 24:39.910
Dad says,
"Run, chickens, run,"

24:39.912 --> 24:40.978
and the first one
to get home wins.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.746
Wins what?

24:42.748 --> 24:45.483
Just wins, babe.
That's the point with Dad.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.618
You should try to win.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.652
Daddy likes a winner?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.588
Go! Go!

24:50.590 --> 24:51.622
Do it!
I'm gone!

24:51.624 --> 24:52.623
Get him, babe!

24:54.226 --> 24:55.693
Watch out.
See y'all!

24:55.695 --> 24:57.061

26:00.726 --> 26:02.893
Thank you.
You're welcome.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.196
Did I really
cause the rain?

26:06.198 --> 26:07.731
Don't worry about it.
It's clearing up.

26:11.703 --> 26:12.603
Mmm.

26:14.172 --> 26:16.073
Oh, wow.
That's quite a headpiece.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.675
Let me ask you,
did you get that directly

26:17.677 --> 26:19.043
from outer space
or was there a middle man?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.679
A Martian broker?
{CHUCKLES}

26:21.681 --> 26:25.849
Come on, now. It was the '70s.
Bowie was to blame
for those outfits.

26:25.851 --> 26:28.018
Ah, Bowie, okay.

26:28.020 --> 26:28.953
Oh.

26:30.855 --> 26:32.790
Are you Lady Divine?

26:32.792 --> 26:35.259
You heard of me?
As young as you are?

26:35.261 --> 26:39.597
<i>Heard of you? So Gone Sucka
was my mama's break-up anthem.</i>

26:39.599 --> 26:41.832
Every time I heard that,
I knew somebody
was getting the ax.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.734
Stop. I love that.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.636
{BOTH CHUCKLE}

Oh. And y'all...
You ladies were...

26:48.608 --> 26:49.773
What?

26:49.775 --> 26:50.874
Y'all were kind of nasty.

No.

Yes, yes. Oh, wow.

27:09.694 --> 27:10.361
Hah, do you miss it?

27:12.063 --> 27:16.000
I don't know. It was
a million years ago.

27:16.002 --> 27:19.269
But it's such a big
part of who you are.

27:19.271 --> 27:22.206
Yeah.
Well, I guess you're right.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.642
You know,
I never would have guessed

27:24.644 --> 27:26.877
that my first
album was my last,

27:26.879 --> 27:28.846
because singing
was everything to me.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.982
But with the kids
and Virgil's career,

27:31.984 --> 27:34.318
it just became
too much to balance,
you know?

27:35.887 --> 27:37.921
But that's cool.
That's life.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.194
Oh, my God.
Is this Virgil?

27:44.196 --> 27:46.830
DAPHNE: With his fine self.

27:49.934 --> 27:51.902
He put himself
through law school
playing clubs.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.104
No, like Ashford & Simpson?

27:54.106 --> 27:55.706
Look here.
Look at my little Gracie.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.309
She looks different.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.879
Yeah. That was before
she got the boobies.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.180
She what?

28:03.182 --> 28:04.214
You know.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.020
You didn't know?

28:13.024 --> 28:16.393
Oh, baby, now I don't mean
to get up in your business,

28:16.395 --> 28:18.829
but how did you not know?

28:20.065 --> 28:22.232
I mean, you don't...
She doesn't...

28:22.234 --> 28:23.834
Yes, yes,
I just... I don't...

28:26.037 --> 28:27.237
I don't know
how I missed that.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.840
Yeah. I don't either.

28:32.911 --> 28:36.880
You know,
all the women in my family
are quite buxom.

28:36.882 --> 28:40.317
And Gloria over there,
she got the family heirlooms,
so to speak,

28:40.319 --> 28:43.487
and all the male attention
when they were growing up.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.957
Poor Grace.
Her being so competitive,
she couldn't accept it.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.294
So a couple of
summers ago...

28:50.296 --> 28:52.429
Okay, you two. Dinner's ready.

28:55.366 --> 28:56.800
What?

28:56.802 --> 28:57.434
Nothing.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.772
Mom, you look
great in that blouse.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.373
Thanks, honey. {CHUCKLES}

29:10.115 --> 29:13.050
GRACE: From where?

29:13.052 --> 29:14.918
I'm sorry, Wade.
I forgot to set
a place for you.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.786
WADE: Thank you.

29:19.357 --> 29:20.390
GLORIA: Everything
seems so pretty.

29:22.393 --> 29:25.529
Enjoying the spread
set before you, Wade?

29:25.531 --> 29:29.399
Wade, you are in for
a treat. Virgil has made
his lobster risotto.

29:29.401 --> 29:30.834
GRACE: Love
Daddy's lobster risotto.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.302
GLORIA: Daddy's best dish.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.271
You're a chef, huh?
It looks incredible.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.340
Thank you.

29:36.342 --> 29:40.010
I took up cooking and a couple
of other hobbies
to blow off steam.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.980
Yeah, we had a real scare
with Virgil last spring.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.381
What happened?
Heart attack.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.150
No.

29:46.152 --> 29:50.087
The only thing I
thought about on that table
was my family.

29:50.089 --> 29:53.824
And when I opened my eyes,
there she was,
my little angel.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.292
I love you, Grace.
I love you, Dad.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.262
Sorry I was
embedded in Iraq last year.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.798
I suppose
the world could have waited
for those reports.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.800
I love all my children.
Daddy has no favorites.

30:04.569 --> 30:06.069
{SIGHS}

30:06.071 --> 30:08.872
You know,
in my family at dinnertime,

30:08.874 --> 30:11.308
we like to go around the room

30:11.310 --> 30:14.044
and say something we love
about each person.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.513
Wade, that's a beautiful idea.
I'll start.

30:17.549 --> 30:18.849
With Simon.

30:20.852 --> 30:23.921
My sweet little Simon.

30:23.923 --> 30:27.424
You know what I love?
The way you always
look out for others.

30:27.426 --> 30:31.161
Whenever someone
has lost their purse
or their credit card,

30:31.163 --> 30:33.564
you always seem to
be the one to find it.

30:33.566 --> 30:34.965
{CHUCKLES}

30:34.967 --> 30:35.999
I love you.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.168
I love you, too.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.103
That was wonderful, Daphne.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.138
Thank you.
Your turn, Si.

30:42.874 --> 30:44.308
Well, I guess Wade.

30:45.577 --> 30:49.313
I appreciate how
you sensed my swag.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.148
When you came in,
you called me "Si."

30:52.317 --> 30:54.551
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.386
It's interesting,
because Virgil knew

30:56.388 --> 30:58.222
I was gonna grow up
to be a black man.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.123
The odds were
pretty strong at birth.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.925
But somehow he managed
to name me Simon.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.362
Simon Latimer Peeples.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.164
Lewis Latimer was
a black man who helped

31:07.166 --> 31:10.033
Thomas Edison
invent the lightbulb.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.436
That's true.
But you can't use that
up in the club, you know.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.937
{CHUCKLING}

31:13.939 --> 31:15.038
Yes!
What club?

31:17.642 --> 31:19.543
You know, dance club.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.012
No, I don't know.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.114
Okay, well, the point is
you can just call me Si now.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.250
Okay? Si. Everybody get that?

31:26.252 --> 31:28.352
All right.
They got it, buddy. Si.

31:28.354 --> 31:29.620
I'd like to do Gloria.

31:29.622 --> 31:32.055
{COUGHS}

31:32.057 --> 31:33.590

asked this. I actually
have something prepared.

Gloria, I love it
when we've had
a long day on location,

31:56.515 --> 31:58.382
and we decide
to have a nice
dinner situation,

31:58.384 --> 32:00.350
and before I see you,

32:00.352 --> 32:02.486
{SNIFFING DEEPLY}

32:02.488 --> 32:05.455
I smell that perfume.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.257
The one from Morocco.
Thank you. That's enough.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.393
Back to you, Dad.
Shh, not done, not done.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.496
And then you walk
across the hotel lobby
wearing that burgundy dress,

32:12.498 --> 32:13.964
the one with the back out.

32:13.966 --> 32:17.200
Blow that back out!
Back out.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.569
And I can just barely see
where the curve
of your form...

32:19.571 --> 32:22.072
Dad's risotto is
getting cold. We should
probably just dig in...

32:22.074 --> 32:22.973
No, no. Continue, Meg.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.077
Dad?

32:27.079 --> 32:28.545
I'm sorry. Let's eat.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.582
If I may?

32:32.584 --> 32:36.086
I just want to say
how thankful I am

32:36.088 --> 32:40.223
to be here with you right now
at this time in my life,

32:41.526 --> 32:43.660
with Grace.

32:43.662 --> 32:47.164
You raised a remarkable woman,
and I learn from
her every single day.

32:48.499 --> 32:50.467
One of the things
I learned is that

32:50.469 --> 32:54.604
no matter what,
the universe
provides all you need.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.507
I think this is
the perfect time.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.544
Wade, you certainly
are a man who believes in
the universe providing.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.212
Like today in the market.
Say what?

33:02.214 --> 33:03.680
What happened at the market?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.983
VIRGIL: Well,
Wade didn't have any money.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.686
But he had
the faith to stand in line
with only lint in his pockets.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.322
Then I came along, and I paid.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.424
So I guess that
makes me the universe.
Right, Wade?

33:15.727 --> 33:16.526
Honorable Peeples...

33:16.528 --> 33:18.662
Judge.

33:18.664 --> 33:22.132
What had happened was,
see, I was there,
and I didn't have my wallet.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.633
Matter of fact,
if you came two
seconds earlier,

33:23.635 --> 33:25.736
you'd see me, I'm like,
"Where did my wallet go?"

33:25.738 --> 33:28.038
I don't know
what happened to it,
but I was looking for it.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.573
I don't know. {CHUCKLING}
Maybe Si can help me find it.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.174
What? Why are you
flipping on me?

33:31.176 --> 33:32.476
I thought we were cool.
I'm not flipping on you.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.543
You trying to say
I stole your wallet?

33:33.545 --> 33:35.312
No, no, no.
Daphne said that...

33:35.314 --> 33:36.613
No, bro,
you don't know me like that,
all right?

33:36.615 --> 33:37.481
You can get that
"clack clack" all day.

33:37.483 --> 33:38.515
It's "click clack."

33:38.517 --> 33:40.317
Simon.
It's Si!

33:40.319 --> 33:41.551
You know,
I got a perfect score

33:41.553 --> 33:43.153
on my math SAT!
It was perfect.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.255
Perfect? I got like a 250.
He's pretty smart.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.657
But the essay... Ahhh.

33:47.659 --> 33:51.194
Oh, who do I have to be now?
Lewis Latimer and
Langston Hughes?

33:51.196 --> 33:53.697
I got cred in the streets
of Sag Harbor, Dad!
Don't test me!

33:53.699 --> 33:55.699
Am I asking for too much?
I had to be

33:55.701 --> 33:57.534
Thurgood Marshall
and John Coltrane.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.636
And I'm about to
be Muhammad Ali
up in here!

33:59.638 --> 34:01.038
SIMON: I break stuff,
I go so hard.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.673
Dad, Mom, it's out of control.

34:03.675 --> 34:06.376
Well, honey, what can I say?
He's my change of life baby.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.447
I'm so exhausted.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.815
Well, your little exercise
really brought
the family together.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.150
Thank you, Wade.

34:20.358 --> 34:21.358
GRACE: All right.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.797
{SPEAKING SPANISH}

34:27.800 --> 34:30.500
As pleasant as
this has all been,
I really should get going.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.369
No!

34:32.371 --> 34:34.371
Daddy picked his
saxophone back up.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.172
He's playing at
The Lusty Sea Hag.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.541
Well, we should all go.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.676
No, no, no.
A Peeples never shows

34:39.678 --> 34:41.745
his hand to family
until it's perfect.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.246
You don't have to be
perfect for family.

34:43.248 --> 34:43.679
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.085
All right, good night.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.585
Good night, Daddy.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.688
Good night, Grace.
Good night, Mr. Peeples.

34:51.690 --> 34:52.789
Good night, Wade.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.860
You know,
I think I'm gonna turn in.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.695
Me, too. If I can.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.530
Oh, Mom, Wade has insomnia.

35:02.233 --> 35:05.502
I know just the thing.
Daughter.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.305
Told you. Mom's into
alternative medicine.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.407
Now, you are gonna love this.

35:11.642 --> 35:13.643
And I think I'm
gonna join you.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.778
Here you go.

35:14.780 --> 35:15.779
You be a lifesaver.

35:15.781 --> 35:16.680
Cheers.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.749
It's all natural.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.852
Everything I need
is out in that
garden out there.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.490
This will take the edge off.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.358
You know what?
It smells like it's...

35:28.360 --> 35:32.662
No, no,
I put together a very, very
herbaceous mix.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.266

{GIGGLES}

35:37.569 --> 35:39.469
Got it, little girl?
Yup.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.237
Good night, baby.
Good night.

35:45.576 --> 35:50.413
Grace's dad is
a little hard to connect with,
but we'll figure it out.

35:50.415 --> 35:51.915
I'm just trying
to find the right
time to propose.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.783
Well, you know, just relax.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.619
<i>WADE: I'm relaxed.</i>

35:55.621 --> 35:57.487
Grace's mom gave me something.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.588
<i>Smells like weed.</i>

35:58.590 --> 36:00.157
Really?

36:00.159 --> 36:03.160
Good stuff?
Rich people stuff?

36:03.162 --> 36:05.462
<i>WADE: Ma Dukes was on
the Soul Train.</i>

36:05.464 --> 36:07.731
Look, just talk
to Dad one-on-one.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.499
He went to this
club to play music.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.701
Oh, that's perfect.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.371
Just go over there,
listen to some music,
have a couple of drinks, talk.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.773
Like, you know, just two guys.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.744
<i>WADE: You're right.
We've got common ground.
We both love Grace.</i>

36:20.746 --> 36:22.212
I could show him the ring.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.813
There you go.

36:23.815 --> 36:28.552
He'll see how serious I am.
Perfect!

36:28.554 --> 36:30.353
<i>CHRIS: Also find out
how the other
women look there.</i>

36:30.355 --> 36:32.389
Rich and fine like Grace,
or rich and husky,

36:32.391 --> 36:35.192

eating turkey legs all day.

Hey, when does
Virgil Peeples go on?

37:00.919 --> 37:03.353
Judge Peeples?
Yeah.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.589
He's a judge,
so why would he
be playing here?

37:08.359 --> 37:09.593
I just thought...

37:40.391 --> 37:41.992
Excuse me.
Oh, God.

37:41.994 --> 37:43.526
What are you doing here?

37:43.528 --> 37:45.262
Nothing.

WOMAN:
This is a private beach.

37:46.932 --> 37:47.897
My fault. Okay.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.533
Hmm.

37:50.535 --> 37:51.968
You'd be a damn
good humpback.

37:53.971 --> 37:57.741
I could use a partner like you
in the three-legged race.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.476
Is that why they
call this Sag Harbor?

Why I gotta see his balls?

38:38.817 --> 38:41.918

out of your head, Wade!

I've already
taken all Meg's money.

Come on in, Wade.
It's your break.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.040
You know,
I think I'm just gonna go

39:04.042 --> 39:06.076
to the guesthouse
and get some sleep.

Where you coming from?

39:07.713 --> 39:09.713

39:09.715 --> 39:11.715
You saw us at
the market today, didn't you?

39:14.885 --> 39:19.422
Can we ever really
trust what I see?
I mean, really? No.

So, Gloria is supposed
to come out to her
family this weekend,

39:21.893 --> 39:23.426
but she's scared of Virgil.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.562
So you seeing us is a problem.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.864
I'm not scared, okay?
I'm waiting

39:27.866 --> 39:30.500
for the right time.
There is a difference.

39:30.502 --> 39:34.738
Please, Gloria.
What's the big deal?
Everybody's gay. Ellen's gay.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.907
Ellen has
an entire network
of people who love her.

39:37.909 --> 39:40.710
The Virgil Peeples
Network is a lot different.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.079
Virgil might be
more open-minded
than you think.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.416
Well, once I'm sure
that this isn't some phase,

39:46.418 --> 39:50.019
that I'm actually gay,
then I'll come out.
Not before.

39:50.021 --> 39:54.657
Okay. You know what?
You're a therapist, Wade.
Talk to her.

39:54.659 --> 39:58.895
I just... I'm not
technically a therapist.

about not peeing
on their parents'...

40:02.567 --> 40:03.967
Wade, talk to her.

When you are having

40:08.906 --> 40:11.408
sex with someone,

40:11.410 --> 40:12.976
is that person
of the same sex?

40:16.046 --> 40:18.615
Yes.
Ding.

40:18.617 --> 40:21.718
When was the last time
you met a person
of the opposite sex

40:21.720 --> 40:22.886
and wanted to have
sex with that person?

40:22.888 --> 40:24.754
Let me think.

40:24.756 --> 40:28.458
Maybe their cologne
or whatever turns you on.

Their nice
manly chest muscles.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.535
Never. Get to the part
where you tell
her she's gay, Wade.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.037
Sexuality can be
very ambiguous.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.473
Many times,
no one category can...

Dude, just tell her.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.075
You're gay.

41:13.904 --> 41:17.173
My Lincoln Prep uniform.

Nothing.

41:29.020 --> 41:32.689
Just went for a walk.
I saw some things.

41:33.691 --> 41:36.893
Then I was over at the house

41:36.895 --> 41:40.163
talking to Meg and Gloria
about their "situation."

41:41.198 --> 41:42.899
What situation?

41:42.901 --> 41:44.901
You know.

You never thought
they were...

Oh, no, no.

Yeah.

Honey, hey.
Whoa. Okay. Honey, listen.

42:02.720 --> 42:06.990
I know that we
kind of got started
in a rough way today, right?

42:06.992 --> 42:08.691
Mmm-hmm.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.661
But I want to make an effort
to not go to bed angry

42:11.663 --> 42:13.897
because you said that
we're never allowed
to go to bed angry.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.965
I'm not angry.

42:15.967 --> 42:20.270
No, but maybe you should be
because I've been
a really bad girl.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.073

What? No.

What is it?

42:26.278 --> 42:27.744
Don't I always tell
you how sexy you are?

42:27.746 --> 42:28.678
All the time.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.248
So why didn't you
tell me about those?

42:32.250 --> 42:34.651
About my breasts?
What about them?

42:34.653 --> 42:38.888
I know about them.
I know there was
some work done.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.057
You just mentioned nothing
all them nights I was...

that these were...

42:44.696 --> 42:47.864
That is incredible.
I've got to tell Skip.

42:47.866 --> 42:49.832
Why you gotta bring
Grandpa into this?

42:49.834 --> 42:52.001
That was how I met him,
because he was my surgeon.

42:52.003 --> 42:54.671
Oh...
Okay.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.139
You know what,
it's been a long day.

42:56.141 --> 42:57.140
We're lying to your family
about living together.

42:57.142 --> 42:58.908
We're not lying. Exactly.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.778
We are. And you know what?
They're lying to each other.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.046
What are you
talking about?

43:03.048 --> 43:05.782
I'm saying I'm
the man in your life.

43:05.784 --> 43:07.183
All right,
we shouldn't have to lie

43:07.185 --> 43:08.651
to your family
about living together.

43:08.653 --> 43:10.954
I ain't afraid
of Judge Peeples.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.822
You are right.

43:14.291 --> 43:16.993
And that is why
I wanted to get
dressed up for you.

43:19.330 --> 43:23.032
And I want to say

54:50.354 --> 54:52.354
What whole thing?

54:52.356 --> 54:55.724
This two-women thing.
What kind of
pleasure is there in that?

54:57.694 --> 55:00.996
Well, pour me a drink,
I'll tell you how
it all goes down.

55:00.998 --> 55:02.998
What?

55:03.000 --> 55:04.433
Gonna need a couple
pairs of scissors.

55:04.435 --> 55:05.801
A couple...

55:05.803 --> 55:07.503
Yeah. And a wet sponge.

55:09.706 --> 55:11.640
So what are your plans?

55:11.642 --> 55:13.809
Uh, um, just...

55:13.811 --> 55:15.978
It's my first time here.

check out Moby Dick Day...

55:18.883 --> 55:20.883
No, I was talking about
your plans with
my granddaughter.

55:21.885 --> 55:23.419
Oh.

55:25.955 --> 55:27.356
I love her
very much, sir.

55:27.358 --> 55:28.490
Any marriage plans?

55:29.693 --> 55:32.361
We... Well, no.
Mmm-mmm.

55:32.363 --> 55:33.829
Not right now.
We just...

55:36.333 --> 55:40.669
I love her. She's...
We're happy just kicking it.

55:40.671 --> 55:42.438
What's that,
"kickin' it"?

55:42.440 --> 55:44.573
Oh, it's just
an expression.
You know, like...

55:44.575 --> 55:45.774
Not really
kicking anything.

55:45.776 --> 55:47.509
It's just hanging out.
Chilling.

55:47.511 --> 55:48.877
Mmm-hmm.

55:48.879 --> 55:51.814
Well,
I suppose a man has to decide

55:51.816 --> 55:53.982
when he wants to
stand up and be a man.

55:55.685 --> 55:56.585

tell him? Tell him!

of their features."

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:43.050
What's wrong with you?

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:45.119
Them goats.
Goats?

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:45.720
You don't see them
goats everywhere?

01:13:45.722 --> 01:13:46.954
No.

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:49.724
"Yet he is but a mask.

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:51.459
"'Tis the thing
behind the mask."

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:52.627
Does the sky
look lower to you?

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.998
The sky? The sky is
where it always is.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.800
This is the good part.
Look, look.

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:03.438
"Let me then be
towed to pieces
while still chasing..."

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:06.874
<i>Jive-ass urine singer!</i>

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:10.445
What?

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:14.749
<i>VIRGIL: Pigheaded triangle
bus-head commie-ass,

01:14:14.751 --> 01:14:17.118
<i>You ain't never
marrying Grace! Not ever!</i>

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:19.487
You talking to me?

01:14:19.489 --> 01:14:20.755
Shhh! Sorry.

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:23.057
"To the last,
I grapple with thee..."

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.826
<i>Wade...</i>

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:27.862
Is he talking to me?
Is he saying, "Wade"?

01:14:27.864 --> 01:14:29.163
I'm looking at the man.
He's saying "Wade."

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:30.698
GRACE: Shh.
He did not say "Wade."

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.234
"From hell's
heart I stab at thee."

01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:36.571
Let's take it outside!
We outside! What's up?

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:38.039
GRACE: Hey, calm down!

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:40.107
Come on then!
Shh!

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:41.209
What are you doing?

01:14:41.211 --> 01:14:42.210
Wish you would.

01:14:42.212 --> 01:14:43.544
Stop it.

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:44.779
I'm right here.

01:14:44.781 --> 01:14:46.113
Stop it, Wade!

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:48.015
Bring it. Stabbing me?

01:14:48.017 --> 01:14:49.684
What's
the matter with...

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:51.919
Please calm down, Wade!

01:14:51.921 --> 01:14:55.490
"For hate's sake,
I spit my last
breath at thee..."

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:57.191
<i>Wade!</i>

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.763
Spit at me? Did he say spit...

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:04.532
No.
Spit at me?

01:15:04.534 --> 01:15:05.633
Um...

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:06.701
I spit on you!

01:15:06.703 --> 01:15:07.768
GRACE: Stop it!

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.670
Dad, I'm so...

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:10.972
{SPITS}
GRACE: Stop it.
What are you doing?

01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:12.206
Whoa!

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:13.841
DAPHNE: Calm down, baby.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.576
GRACE: What is
wrong with you?
Sorry, kids.

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:17.578
Maybe we should go home.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.614
You're supposed to die now.
What?

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.215
WADE: You're supposed to die.
He's getting there.

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:23.184
I know the book.
You're supposed to die.

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:24.886
Captain Ahab!

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:25.987
Moby Dick kills you!
GRACE: Wow. Okay. Stop it!

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:27.221
Die! Die! Die!

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:28.956
Stop it!

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.591
That's a threat!
That's a threat!

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:33.628
I will kill you myself!

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:45.573
Virgil!
No. No.

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:48.543
DAPHNE: Virgil.

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:50.177
Don't you dare!

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:53.581
Die!
{SCREAMING}

01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:54.882

My God! Go, go, go!

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.000

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:16.237
Wade?
{CAMERA CLICKS}

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.305
Stop that.
Wade!

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:20.241
MAN 2: Is he dead?

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:21.208
Dr. Chris,
is he gonna be okay?

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.313
We're gonna need 10 cc's of...

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:27.148
Is that blood?

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:31.886
Um... Call a doctor.

01:16:31.888 --> 01:16:33.854
GRACE: Doctor! Doctor!

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.958
I thought he was a doctor.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.792
Mmm.

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:52.239
Mmm.

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:55.042
What happened?

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:56.677
Um...

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.779
Well, we're not
exactly sure,

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:01.382
but the doctor
said that you had

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:03.250
something called
psilocybin in your system.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:05.820
Philahcybin?

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.624
It basically means
you were tripping on 'shrooms.

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.393
Honey, I hate
to say this, truly,

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:14.061
but the writing
is on the wall.

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:16.330
He is on drugs.

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:18.232
He ruined my
beloved Moby Dick Day.

01:17:18.234 --> 01:17:20.001
Your mother's
property is missing.

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:22.303
Not to mention
the small fact that

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.338
he burnt down Chief
Oneka's sweat lodge.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.307
No.
Yes, it's gone.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:27.708
Did you?

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:29.377
I should go.

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:30.411
Yes, you should.
And take your
brother with you.

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:32.246
What did I do?

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:34.915
What kind of doctor passes out
at the first sight of blood?

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:36.884
I'm not sure.

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:38.986
And I think you may have
disrespected our Meg here.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:41.322
I see the looks she gives you.
{GRUNTS SOFTLY}

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.724
Grace, I'll explain everything
when we get back to the city.

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.662
Are you coming?

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:51.232
You don't fit in around here.

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.836
The Peeples don't lie.
We don't steal.

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:59.173
We tell the truth,
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:00.341
You tell your family
the whole naked truth?

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:02.677
What?

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:05.279
You just let it
all hang out there
for everybody to see, huh?

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:06.747
He's lost his mind.

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:09.283
I was at
the private beach, Virgil.

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:12.053
I know all about
you and Mayor Hodge,

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:15.056
and getting freaky with
all your sagging
nut buddies watching.

01:18:15.058 --> 01:18:16.323
GRACE: Whoa, Wade!

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:18.459
Like I said,
he is out of
his mind, Grace.

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:21.028
And what about playing at
The Lusty Sea Hag, huh?
How's that going?

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.930
Using that excuse
about how the family

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:24.765
can't hear you play
until it's perfect.

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:26.934
Well, go on, play something.

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:30.004
You must be pretty good
after all those late nights.

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:32.206
Maybe you should,
Virgil.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.908
I'm not gonna
play for this junkie!

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.143
Get out!
Gladly.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.180
Grace.

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:42.883
Are you coming?

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:51.992
All right.

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:57.765
Come on, Chris.

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:03.304
If anything changes, I...
Chris.

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:04.271
Okay.

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:17.985
Good. Now that that's over,
things can finally
get back to normal.

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:25.526
Dad?
Yes, sweetie.

01:19:25.528 --> 01:19:26.861
You didn't
answer the question.

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:28.329
What question?

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:30.097
You always taught
me to look every

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.966
examiner in the eye
and answer directly,

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:34.368
but you didn't answer Wade,
and in fact, you looked away.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:37.071
I don't recall.

01:19:37.073 --> 01:19:39.006
What beach was
he talking about?

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:42.510
Yeah, whose sagging nuts
was he talking about?

01:19:42.512 --> 01:19:45.546
How am I supposed to know
what is in his
hallucinogenic mind?

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:47.214
It's the drugs talking.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:50.050
You're looking away again!

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:51.285
Are you seeing
Johnnie Hodge?

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:54.155
And now you, Daphne?

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:57.291
You've been coming
home late, Virgil,
smelling like seawater.

01:19:59.027 --> 01:19:59.927
What's going on?

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.966
I swim with the Humpbacks.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:08.035
The nudist hippies?

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:10.004
Oh, snap!

01:20:10.006 --> 01:20:13.941
They're not hippies.
It's naturalism.

01:20:13.943 --> 01:20:16.277
It's something I do to
help me relieve stress
since the heart attack.

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:17.578
It has nothing to do with sex.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.214
It doesn't?

01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:21.582
No, baby. You are
the only woman for me.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.452
Wade was telling the truth!

01:20:25.454 --> 01:20:27.955
You still don't
get it, sweetie.

01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:30.457
So what that he
saw me at the beach?

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:34.094
That still doesn't explain
the money scams at the market,

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:38.098
Meg and Gloria's odd behavior
since he arrived,
your mother's earrings,

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.534
and the fact that
that dope fiend
tried to kill me.

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:41.569
I put the 'shrooms
in that drink.

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:44.004
I stole Mom's earrings.

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:46.440
Meg and I are a couple.

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:50.477
A couple of what?

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:52.479
A couple of dykes.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:53.914
I knew it!

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:54.548
We're in love, Dad.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.590
You are my family. I love you.

01:21:02.592 --> 01:21:05.993
But you act as if
I am some pompous ass
that nobody can talk to.

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:11.565
And what is this
about 'shrooms?

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:13.934
No more gardening.
You're going back to rehab.

01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:15.035
Okay.

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:15.870
{DOG WHINING}

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:18.439
What is that?

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:28.482
Oh, the poor guy.
He did lose his wallet.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:31.018
He gave me advice
on how to get a girl,
and it worked.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.120
When?

01:21:33.122 --> 01:21:35.256
When he locked
me in the bathroom
at The Lusty Sea Hag.

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:38.359
What are you talking about?

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:39.994
I think the dude was
just trying to propose.

01:21:39.996 --> 01:21:41.395
What is this?

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:50.037
"Grace, my love,
my truth. Wade."

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:52.172
I got that one
from Virgil's pants.

01:21:52.174 --> 01:21:53.641
What was this
doing in your pants?

01:21:53.643 --> 01:21:56.443
Simon, why are you always
in somebody's stuff?

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:57.945
Did you know
that he was
gonna propose to me?

01:21:57.947 --> 01:21:58.946
You are grounded!
Dad!

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:03.951
He came to the sweat lodge
and asked for your
hand in marriage,

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:04.618
then he burned it down.

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:07.988
{TEARFULLY} Oh, my God!

01:22:09.624 --> 01:22:10.925
Gracie.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.161
Oh, sweetie.

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:15.095
{SOBS}

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.641
GRACE: Hey.
Chris, please call me back.

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:29.343
I know that he's with you.

01:22:29.345 --> 01:22:32.279
I just... I can't...
I just can't reach him. Okay?

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:38.385
Wade?

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:25.733
Where you want this?
Right here.

01:23:25.735 --> 01:23:27.067
Fine.

01:23:39.247 --> 01:23:39.780
What are you doing here?

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:46.320
Well, I came to propose.

01:23:46.322 --> 01:23:49.790
I want you to put
this on my finger
and please come home.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.396
No. I'm sorry.
The answer is no.

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:02.336
I'm not cut out
to be a Peeples.
I can't have secrets.

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:05.572
I can't hide my quirks
or weaknesses, all right?

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:09.209
From anybody.
Least of all, you.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:12.513
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:24:12.515 --> 01:24:16.150
I did not
introduce you to my father
because I was worried that

01:24:16.152 --> 01:24:19.186
he would pick you
apart and tell me
that you weren't good enough.

01:24:19.188 --> 01:24:20.821
I was scared that
he wouldn't see what I see,

01:24:20.823 --> 01:24:22.523
which is that
you're incredible.

01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:25.259
I love you, Wade.

01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:27.594
And I think that
you are crazy enough

01:24:27.596 --> 01:24:29.430
to love me for
who I actually am.

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:38.572
So, Wade Walker,

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:42.776
will you marry me?

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.250
I don't know. It depends.

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:53.787
Do you promise to trust me?

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.691
To be honest

01:24:57.693 --> 01:24:59.259
and work through
any problems?
Yes.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:01.695
No more "peanuts."
No more "peanuts."

01:25:01.697 --> 01:25:03.664
No more safe word.
We talk it out.

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:06.633
Okay.

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:08.702
You're gonna
tell me about jail.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.375
Well, in that case,
Grace Peeples...

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.746
{GIGGLES}

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:22.282
...will you marry me?

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:28.822
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
{LAUGHING} Yes.

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:37.197
You know
what this means?

01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:38.699
What?

01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:39.333
No more putting
Daddy on a pedestal.

01:25:39.335 --> 01:25:40.734
Nope.

01:25:40.736 --> 01:25:41.435
I'm your man now.
You understand?

01:25:41.437 --> 01:25:42.836
Yes.

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:44.771
He does not make
the decisions in our life.

01:25:44.773 --> 01:25:46.573
What father?
Never heard of him.

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:48.709
That point needs
to be negotiated.

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:50.511
Dad, how did you
know where we were?

01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:52.346
I'm brilliant, Grace.

01:25:52.348 --> 01:25:54.414
Well, that's true.

01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:55.582
VIRGIL: And Chris told me.

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:57.918
He scares me.

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:04.558
Virgil, you expect me
to be the man you are today.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.560
That takes time.

01:26:06.562 --> 01:26:09.530
And quite frankly,
I don't even know if
I wanna be that crazy.

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:12.332
Well, I suppose
I deserve that.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:15.402
That's why I
brought some Peeples,

01:26:15.404 --> 01:26:18.539
who not unlike myself,
left you out there to dry.

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:25.212
Now, a Peeples
never shows his hand
to family until it is perfect.

01:26:25.214 --> 01:26:27.414
But if you allow me,
I would like

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:28.916
to attempt
something for you now.

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:32.486
So you're saying
we're family?

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:34.922
I'm family?

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:42.196
Yes, we're family.

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:48.902
{CHUCKLES}

01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:02.382
There comes a time
in everyone's life

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:03.917
when you have to
express yourself.

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.754
Holding things in
makes us do strange things.

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.257
Deny your true love.

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:13.660
Drink trippy smoothies.

01:27:13.662 --> 01:27:17.564
Steal jewelry
from your own momma.

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:21.668
My eyes still burn
from the sagging horrors
I've witnessed at the beach.

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:22.669
