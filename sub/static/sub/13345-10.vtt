WEBVTT

00:13.547 --> 00:17.185
- HELLO, KATE.
- ROSIE SAID YOU'D BE HERE.

00:17.285 --> 00:21.122
IS THERE--
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

00:21.222 --> 00:24.058
THESE ARE THE
FINANCIAL AID FORMS
I ASKED YOU TO SIGN

00:24.158 --> 00:26.327
FOR ROSIE'S
COLLEGE APPLICATION.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.063
I DIDN'T
KNOW YOUR INCOME
THIS YEAR, SO...

00:29.163 --> 00:31.232
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.202
OKAY.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.937
OH, AND UM...

00:37.037 --> 00:38.672
ROSIE'S AT HER FRIEND
BECCA'S HOUSE.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.309
THEY'RE WORKING
ON A SCIENCE PROJECT,
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT

00:41.409 --> 00:43.311
UNTIL AFTER DINNER
TO PICK HER UP, OKAY?

00:43.411 --> 00:45.346
WHY CAN'T SHE DO IT
SOME OTHER NIGHT?

00:45.446 --> 00:47.281
I ONLY SEE HER
TWO NIGHTS A WEEK.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.950
WELL, WHO'S CHOICE
WAS THAT, PAUL?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.686
I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO WAIT AROUND
UNTIL SHE'S FINISHED?

00:52.786 --> 00:55.156
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO UNTIL THEN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.691
MAYBE YOU COULD SEE
YOUR OTHER CHILD?

00:57.791 --> 01:01.962
( stammers )
IT'S-- I'M SORRY.
PLEASE, LET'S NOT DO THIS NOW.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.632
AND PLEASE DON'T COME
TO MY THERAPIST'S, OKAY?

01:04.732 --> 01:07.768
PLEASE DON'T COME HERE.
I HAVE ONE FUCKING HOUR
TO MYSELF.

01:07.868 --> 01:12.072
- PLEASE.
- I THINK YOU HAVE YOUR
WHOLE LIFE TO YOURSELF NOW.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.542
WHY DON'T YOU ENJOY IT?

01:22.082 --> 01:25.286
- HELLO, TAMMY.
- TIMING.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.955
I HOPE...

01:28.055 --> 01:31.125
- I HOPE YOU
DIDN'T HEAR ALL THAT.
- OH NO, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.094
ACTUALLY I'M GLAD
I RAN INTO YOU.

01:34.195 --> 01:38.799
I WANTED TO TELL YOU HOW SORRY
I WAS ABOUT INTERRUPTING
YOUR SESSION LAST WEEK.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.634
OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S FINE.

01:40.734 --> 01:44.338
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- WELL, IT'S YOUR TURN.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.508
- HAVE FUN.
- OKAY.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.443
Both: BYE.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.823
( theme music playing )

02:20.541 --> 02:22.676
TAMMY LOOKED LIKE SHE HAD
A GOOD SESSION TODAY.

02:22.776 --> 02:26.046
WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT
ANOTHER PATIENT, PAUL.
YOU SAID THAT LAST WEEK.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.081
WELL, GINA, I SAID A LOT
OF THINGS LAST WEEK

02:28.182 --> 02:30.184
AND THE TRUTH IS I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.

02:30.284 --> 02:34.388
LOOK, I CAN'T BE
IN THERAPY WITH YOU.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.658
I MEAN, IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.
IF I WERE TO GO TO THERAPY,

02:37.758 --> 02:40.528
OBVIOUSLY I WOULD COME
TO YOU, OF COURSE.

02:40.628 --> 02:44.532
BUT IT'S-- IT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO--

02:44.632 --> 02:47.301
TO-TO MAKE MYSELF
MORE MISERABLE.

02:47.401 --> 02:50.103
IS THAT WHAT
WE WERE GOING TO DO,
MAKE YOU MORE MISERABLE?

02:50.204 --> 02:52.673
I DIDN'T WANT
TO JUST PHONE, YOU KNOW.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.209
( clears throat )

02:55.309 --> 02:57.445
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
- ABSOLUTELY.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.350
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THIS, PAUL.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.453
BUT I RESPECT
YOUR DECISION, SO.

03:05.553 --> 03:10.324
- YOU RESPECT MY DECISION?
- YES, OF COURSE I DO.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.961
- DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?
- NO NO NO.

03:14.061 --> 03:17.130
YOU STAY HERE
AND WAIT FOR THE KIDS.
IT'S FINE.

03:17.231 --> 03:20.968
BUT SINCE I'VE GOT
SOME FREE TIME, I NEED
TO DO SOME SHOPPING.

03:21.068 --> 03:25.105
- YOU'RE GOING SHOPPING?
- YEAH, DO YOU NEED ANYTHING
FROM THE MARKET?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.207
WHAT WOULD I NEED
FROM THE MARKET, GINA?

03:27.308 --> 03:29.643
OH, RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.850
DID-- WAIT, DID YOU WANT
ME TO ARGUE WITH YOU?

03:36.950 --> 03:40.754
DO YOU WANT ME TO PERSUADE
YOU TO COME TO THERAPY?

03:40.854 --> 03:43.524
DID YOU WANT ME TO JUST,
LIKE, LEAVE YOU A MESSAGE?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.626
NO NO, THIS IS VERY POLITE.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.062
- UM, I'M GONNA--
- WE CAN'T HAVE AN HOUR
OF CONVERSATION?

03:49.162 --> 03:53.634
- THAT'S WHAT WE DID LAST WEEK.
- I'LL PAY YOU FOR AN HOUR
OF CONVERSATION.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.571
- I DON'T SELL MY CONVERSATIONS.
- MAYBE WE SHOULD CHARGE
FOR CONVERSATIONS.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.941
IF ANYONE LEARNS ANYTHING
IT'D BE ALL THE BETTER.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.411
UM, SO ARE YOU
GONNA STAY HERE

04:03.511 --> 04:06.079
- WHILE I'M GONE?
- OKAY, I GET WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

04:06.179 --> 04:10.183
- WHAT-- WHAT AM I DOING?
- WOMEN, THEY'RE ALL THE SAME,
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.854
EXCUSE ME?! MAYBE IT'S
NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU
TO STAY HERE.

04:13.954 --> 04:17.291
- I JUST WANT YOU
TO STAY AND TALK.
- YOU SAID THAT.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.927
10 MINUTES, PLEASE.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.696
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF A WEEK I'VE HAD, GINA.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.665
I'VE GOT THIS CEO GUY,

04:24.765 --> 04:28.035
HE PAYS ME BY THE INSIGHT.
WHEN I GIVE HIM THE INSIGHT
HE DOESN'T WANT--

04:28.135 --> 04:31.872
YOU KNOW, I REALLY LOATHE
PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN JUST
BUY WHATEVER THEY WANT.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.776
THEN I'VE GOT THIS FORMER
PATIENT WHO I HAVEN'T SEEN
FOR 20 YEARS

04:35.876 --> 04:39.212
WHO THINKS THAT
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
IN THE MEANTIME IS MY FAULT.

04:39.313 --> 04:43.317
I JUST WANT TO--
I JUST WANT TO REST FOR
A FEW MINUTES, THAT'S ALL.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.889
OKAY.

04:48.989 --> 04:52.626
- JUST A FEW MINUTES THOUGH.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.963
( sighs )

04:57.264 --> 04:59.467
YOU CAN'T GET ANY REST
ON THE TRAIN?

04:59.567 --> 05:02.169
ON THE TRAIN I TALK TO YOU,
BUT YOU DON'T TALK BACK.

05:02.269 --> 05:05.473
NOT JUST YOU, I TALK TO ALL
THE PEOPLE I DON'T SEE
ALL WEEK.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.342
- LIKE KATE AND THE BOYS.
- AND ROSIE.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.244
AND THIS WEEK I TALKED
TO TAMMY KENT.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.881
WHY AM I THINKING ABOUT
TAMMY KENT ALL THE TIME?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.383
I DON'T KNOW.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.185
I WAS SO HAPPY AT HER HOUSE
WHEN I WAS 17.

05:18.285 --> 05:21.321
WAS THAT THE LAST TIME
I WAS HAPPY, I WONDER.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.891
I DON'T THINK SO, PAUL.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.761
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
BEING AT HER HOME THAT
MADE ME SO HAPPY?

05:27.861 --> 05:29.029
I DON'T KNOW.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.932
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING YOU
COULD WORK ON IN THERAPY.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.836
YEAH. I COULD ALSO WORK
ON WHY I SAY SUCH STUPID
THINGS ABOUT WOMEN.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.539
THAT WOMEN ARE ALL THE SAME,
WHAT A STUPID THING TO SAY.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.642
GINA, I'M--
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.714
PEOPLE SAY STUPID THINGS
WHEN THEY'RE ANGRY.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.117
ANGER IS ALSO A GOOD THING
YOU COULD WORK ON IN THERAPY.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.587
I CALLED MY LAWYER
FROM THE TRAIN.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.457
IT TURNS OUT THAT MR. PRINCE'S
LAWYERS ARE...

05:56.557 --> 05:59.893
THEY'RE DEPOSING
LAURA TODAY.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.330
- LAURA?!
- YEAH, SHE HAD
A RELATIONSHIP WITH ALEX.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.499
I KNOW SHE HAD
A RELATIONSHIP WITH ALEX,

06:05.599 --> 06:07.267
WHILE SHE WAS
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.803
THAT'S A DANGEROUS
TRIANGLE.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.141
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT SHE'LL
USE THIS AS A WAY TO GET
BACK AT YOU?

06:14.241 --> 06:15.943
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'LL SAY.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.379
MAYBE SHE REALLY THINKS THAT IT
IS MY FAULT THAT ALEX IS DEAD.

06:19.480 --> 06:24.151
YEAH, GINA, THAT-THAT'S--
THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD THING
TO WORK OUT HERE.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.154
FINE.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.090
I'M LIKE MY PATIENTS,
YOU KNOW.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.459
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THERAPY,

06:31.559 --> 06:33.694
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT MY--

06:33.794 --> 06:36.530
MY PARENTS.
MY PAST IS FINE.

06:36.630 --> 06:40.000
IT'S THE PRESENT THAT
CAUSES THE PROBLEMS.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.637
WELL, I'M SURE IT'S
OCCURRED TO YOU, PAUL,

06:43.737 --> 06:47.475
THAT... THAT WHY YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT TAMMY SO MUCH--

06:47.575 --> 06:49.309
NO, GINA, NOTHING HAS
OCCURRED TO ME.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.411
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M HERE?

06:52.145 --> 06:53.447
I'M SORRY.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.583
PLEASE...

06:55.683 --> 06:58.719
TELL ME WHAT'S
OCCURRED TO YOU.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.356
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN TAMMY KENT

07:03.457 --> 07:06.494
BECAUSE THERE'S
SOMETHING INCOMPLETE

07:06.594 --> 07:10.464
IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING
OF YOUR FATHER'S ABANDONMENT

07:10.564 --> 07:12.299
AND YOUR MOTHER'S BREAKDOWN.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.268
- AND HOW DOES
TAMMY FIT INTO THIS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.371
- CAN'T YOU GUESS?
- THERE'S AN IDEA.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.875
GUESS THERAPY.
YOU TELL ME A PROBLEM YOU HAVE,

07:21.975 --> 07:24.645
AND I'LL TRY
TO GUESS WHAT CAUSED IT
AND IF I GUESS RIGHT,

07:24.745 --> 07:27.515
- I WIN!
- WELL, THE ONLY PROBLEM IS

07:27.615 --> 07:31.451
I'D HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
CAUSED MY PROBLEM IN ORDER
TO SAY WHETHER YOU WERE RIGHT.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.954
ALL RIGHT, TRUE.

07:34.054 --> 07:38.258
YES, IT-- IT-- IT HAD
OCCURRED TO ME TOO

07:38.358 --> 07:40.360
THAT MY RESPONSE
TO TAMMY KENT

07:40.460 --> 07:43.997
WAS TIED UP WITH
MY MOTHER'S DEATH SOMEHOW,

07:44.097 --> 07:47.801
THAT SEEING TAMMY OPENED
A KIND OF A WINDOW

07:47.901 --> 07:50.103
ONTO THAT TIME.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.205
SUDDENLY WITH TAMMY THERE,

07:52.305 --> 07:55.509
I FELT I HAD TO LOOK IN,

07:55.609 --> 07:57.778
YOU KNOW, I THINK,

07:57.878 --> 08:01.849
TO SEE MYSELF
BEFORE THE FALL MAYBE.

08:01.949 --> 08:05.252
AND TAMMY AND I
WERE LOVERS--

08:05.352 --> 08:08.622
AND I'D WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT TOO.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.859
BUT I CAN'T TALK ABOUT TAMMY
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR PATIENT.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.927
SO--

08:14.027 --> 08:17.397
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE I'LL JUST TAKE TAMMY
OUT FOR A COFFEE SOMETIME,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.768
BUT I WON'T GO LOOKING
IN THE MOTHER WINDOW.

08:20.868 --> 08:24.437
I'LL JUST LET IT ALL STAY

08:24.538 --> 08:27.507
- DEAD.
- THE PROBLEM IS
IT'S NOT DEAD.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.577
IT'S THE UNDEAD.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.580
LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE--
YOU KILL IT, YOU BURY IT,

08:32.680 --> 08:35.583
BUT THEN IT COMES RIGHT BACK,
RIGHT OUT OF THE GRAVE.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.251
- MOTHER!
- ( chuckles )

08:39.753 --> 08:43.824
THOSE ARE THE MONSTERS--
THE THINGS THAT WON'T STAY DEAD.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.360
AND ONE NIGHT
WHEN YOU'RE TOO TIRED
TO KILL THE THING AGAIN,

08:47.460 --> 08:49.362
YOU LET IT KILL YOU, JUST--

08:49.462 --> 08:53.166
JUST SO THAT IT WILL
AT LEAST BE OVER.

08:59.139 --> 09:02.943
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
HAPPENED TO YOUR ALEX
UP THERE IN HIS PLANE?

09:04.612 --> 09:07.314
THAT INSTEAD OF FIGHTING
HIS GUILT ONE MORE TIME,

09:07.414 --> 09:09.683
HE JUST GAVE INTO IT

09:09.783 --> 09:11.885
SO IT WOULD BE OVER?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.189
YEAH.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.860
IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW MUCH
FIGHT A PERSON HAS IN HIM.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.595
- TRUE.
- YOU, FOR INSTANCE.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.064
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME, GINA.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.500
I'M GLAD.
BUT I WONDER WHY YOU THINK
YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH

09:27.601 --> 09:29.502
LEFT TO FIGHT YOUR MOTHER
ONE MORE TIME.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.039
I MEAN, MAYBE
THIS TIME YOU'D WIN.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.841
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

09:33.941 --> 09:36.777
I'M SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE YOU
COULD FINALLY LAY THEM TO REST.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.212
ONE OF THEM-- MY DAD--
IS STILL ALIVE.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.848
OF COURSE
I KNOW THAT.

09:40.948 --> 09:45.485
BUT STILL,
IF YOU HAD CLARITY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN,

09:45.585 --> 09:49.022
MAYBE THAT COULD ALL
REST IN PEACE.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.958
AND SO COULD YOU.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.966
- HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
- AS A GOAL FOR THERAPY?

09:59.066 --> 10:02.535
AS A GOAL,
THERAPY OR NOT.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.538
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT
WITHOUT THERAPY.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.441
I-I KNOW IT.
I WON'T DO THE WORK.
I WON'T--

10:08.541 --> 10:11.611
I WON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
I'LL JUST GO ON BLAMING MYSELF,

10:11.712 --> 10:15.883
TAKING IT OUT ON EVERYBODY ELSE.
I'LL START SMOKING AGAIN,
DRINKING TOO MUCH.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.552
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT DRINKING
WAS A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

10:19.653 --> 10:23.791
IT'S... AS LONG AS I DON'T
DRINK ALONE, IT ISN'T.

10:25.592 --> 10:29.229
WHY AM I SO RESISTANT TO YOU?
WHY DO I COME ALL THE WAY
DOWN HERE,

10:29.329 --> 10:32.499
ONLY TO TELL YOU THAT I DON'T
WANT TO BE IN THERAPY?

10:32.599 --> 10:37.170
CLEARLY I HAVE TO BE IN THERAPY.
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS
NEXT PART OF MY LIFE GOES.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.472
I HAVE TO KNOW IF
I'M DOING THE RIGHT JOB.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.274
I HAVE TO KNOW
IF I'M HELPING PEOPLE.

10:41.374 --> 10:45.012
AND IF I'M NOT, I HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NEXT.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.782
DID YOU REALLY WORRY
THAT I COULDN'T HEAR

10:48.882 --> 10:50.851
ABOUT TAMMY BECAUSE
SHE WAS MY PATIENT?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.986
OF COURSE I DID.
I DO!

10:53.086 --> 10:56.423
- I APPRECIATE THAT.
- AND?

10:56.523 --> 11:00.427
SO I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER
I COULD TREAT YOU BOTH,

11:00.527 --> 11:03.630
ESPECIALLY IF
ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.700
DO YOU THINK SOMETHING
IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US?

11:06.800 --> 11:10.804
NOT NECESSARILY,
BUT I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.874
NO, I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.043
- ARE YOU SURE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.611
AS SURE AS YOU WERE
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME FOR THERAPY?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.914
OKAY,

11:21.014 --> 11:24.317
WHO DOESN'T WANT
TO BE BACK IN BED WITH
HIS HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEART,

11:24.417 --> 11:26.820
THE GIRL WHO LOOKS AT HIM
IN THE WAY HE USED TO BE?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.622
I MEAN, DON'T YOU THINK
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT?

11:29.723 --> 11:31.558
NO, LET'S TRY AND STAY
ON THE TOPIC, PAUL.

11:31.658 --> 11:35.763
OH, SURE. SORRY.
I THOUGHT I WAS BEGINNING
TO ENJOY MYSELF.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.998
IF I'M GOING TO TREAT
BOTH YOU AND TAMMY,

11:38.098 --> 11:40.300
THERE'S GOING
TO HAVE TO BE SOME RULES.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.235
LIKE?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.271
WELL...

11:44.371 --> 11:48.675
IF YOU WERE THE THERAPIST
AND YOU HAD TWO PATIENTS

11:48.776 --> 11:50.210
WHO HAD A HISTORY,

11:50.310 --> 11:53.881
- WHAT RULES WOULD YOU WANT?
- OKAY, WELL,

11:53.981 --> 11:58.151
I WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR
THAT I COULDN'T TELL
EITHER OF THEM

11:58.251 --> 12:02.823
ANYTHING THAT I HAD LEARNED
IN SESSION ABOUT THE OTHER.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.192
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

12:05.292 --> 12:09.797
AND... THEY COULDN'T
EXPECT ME TO ANALYZE

12:09.897 --> 12:12.299
THE OTHER ONE
AND THEY COULDN'T USE ME

12:12.399 --> 12:16.303
TO SEND MESSAGES BACK--
BACK AND FORTH.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.773
- OKAY.
- MY SEEING THEM WOULD
HAVE TO BE A KIND

12:19.873 --> 12:21.875
OF OPEN SECRET.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.944
WE'D ALL KNOW ABOUT IT,
OF COURSE,

12:24.044 --> 12:28.181
BUT WE'D ALL PUT IT AWAY
AND JUST NOT USE IT.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.518
ALL? EVEN YOU?
YOU THINK YOU COULD DO THAT?

12:35.488 --> 12:37.257
I THINK SO, YEAH.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.460
WHEN ALEX AND LAURA
SLEPT TOGETHER, YOU KEPT
YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT

12:40.560 --> 12:43.596
- OUT OF THEIR THERAPY?
- WELL, AS I REMEMBER IT,

12:43.696 --> 12:46.266
I THREW THE AFFAIR IN HER FACE
AND A CUP OF COFFEE IN HIS,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.601
BUT THAT, THAT--
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.537
HOW WAS THAT
DIFFERENT?

12:50.637 --> 12:52.539
THEIR AFFAIR WAS ABOUT ME.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.008
LAURA SLEPT WITH ALEX

12:55.108 --> 12:57.144
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
SLEEP WITH HER.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.180
AND HE SLEPT WITH HER
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T GIVE--

13:01.781 --> 13:03.783
AND HE SLEPT WITH HER
BECAUSE SHE WAS GORGEOUS

13:03.884 --> 13:05.518
AND HE FELT LIKE--

13:05.618 --> 13:09.222
WHAT WERE YOU GOING
TO SAY, PAUL, BEFORE YOU
CORRECTED YOURSELF?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.292
HE SLEPT WITH HER
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T...?

13:12.392 --> 13:15.762
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T TELL HIM
NOT TO FLY AGAIN.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.999
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T TRY
TO CONTROL HIS RECKLESSNESS.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.903
AND HE WANTED TO SHOW ME WHAT
KIND OF DAMAGE HE COULD DO.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.239
- BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT?
- NO, I DIDN'T.

13:26.339 --> 13:30.477
I GUESS I WAS TOO INVOLVED
SO I DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE.

13:30.577 --> 13:34.581
HE COUNTED ON ME TO CONTROL
HIS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE INFLUENCES.

13:34.681 --> 13:38.952
INSTEAD I LASHED OUT AT HIM,
HE LASHED OUT AT HIMSELF AND...

13:41.889 --> 13:44.391
AND DOWN HE WENT.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.426
SO...

13:46.526 --> 13:50.697
YOU CAN SEE WHY I NEED
TO REMAIN NEUTRAL IF
SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN?

13:50.797 --> 13:52.432
OF COURSE.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.903
I NEED YOU TO PROMISE ME
THAT NOTHING'S GOING
TO HAPPEN.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.072
SURE.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.810
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
WITH TAMMY KENT

14:03.911 --> 14:05.745
UNTIL OR UNLESS

14:05.845 --> 14:08.949
WE ARE NO LONGER
YOUR PATIENTS.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.754
I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

14:14.854 --> 14:16.856
UM, THAT...

14:16.957 --> 14:19.526
WHAT YOU'VE SAID ABOUT ALEX
TODAY STAYS WITH ME.

14:19.626 --> 14:23.430
I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION
ANY OF THAT IN THE DEPOSITION.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.099
OKAY THEN.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.138
- OKAY.
- DO YOU WANT TO PROCEED?

14:35.642 --> 14:37.010
YES, I DO.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.113
GOOD, I'M GLAD.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.751
SO LET'S BEGIN.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.187
UM...

14:49.456 --> 14:51.858
LAST WEEK YOU MENTIONED
YOUR HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEART.

14:51.959 --> 14:55.228
YEAH, TAMMY KENT.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.999
LAST WEEK YOU CALLED HER
TAMMY KENT-- ALSO BY
HER FULL NAME.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.068
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
CALLED HER.

15:01.168 --> 15:05.272
THERE WAS ANOTHER TAMMY
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO WE
CALLED THIS ONE TAMMY KENT.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.708
- AND SHE LIVED DOWN THE HALL?
- THEY MOVED IN WHEN
I WAS ABOUT 14.

15:08.808 --> 15:12.212
- YES.
- AND THAT WAS ABOUT THE TIME
YOUR FATHER MOVED OUT?

15:14.547 --> 15:17.450
NN-NO, HE MOVED OUT
A LITTLE BIT AFTER THAT.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.723
YOU KNOW, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
THE WORST TIME OF MY LIFE
WITH MY FATHER GONE

15:23.823 --> 15:26.193
AND MY MOTHER
BEGINNING HER...

15:27.260 --> 15:29.629
YOU KNOW,
TO SUFFER HER BOUTS OF...

15:31.298 --> 15:34.567
DEPRESSION, BUT IT
WASN'T SAD, YOU KNOW?

15:34.667 --> 15:36.936
I WAS-- I WAS EXCITED.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.306
WHAT WAS IT
THAT EXCITED YOU?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.274
TAMMY.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.711
SHE'D SHOW UP OUT OF THIN AIR
WHEN I WAS HAVING THE WORST DAY

15:44.811 --> 15:47.347
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE'D JUST START TALKING.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.717
AND EVERYTHING BAD
ABOUT MY HOUSE,

15:50.817 --> 15:53.620
IT FELT LIKE A MOVIE.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.456
IT FELT LIKE A MOVIE
THAT I WAS WATCHING,
BUT THAT I WASN'T--

15:56.556 --> 15:58.458
THAT I WASN'T IN.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.061
AND EVEN IF MY MOTHER
WAS CRYING ALL DAY,

16:01.161 --> 16:05.498
I'D TELL TAMMY KENT
AND SHE'D SAY, "YEAH,
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY."

16:05.598 --> 16:07.500
WHAT WOULD BE OKAY?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.570
I DON'T KNOW, SHE JUST
MADE ME FEEL THAT I COULD
GET THROUGH IT.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.939
AND-- AND-- AND THAT

16:13.040 --> 16:15.208
IF I LET MY MOTHER CRY

16:15.308 --> 16:17.544
THAT THAT WAS OKAY TOO.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.979
AND I...

16:20.080 --> 16:22.015
HAD THE HOPE THAT WHEN
I WENT BACK DOWN THE HALL

16:22.115 --> 16:24.017
THINGS WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.818
OR IF THEY WEREN'T,
AT LEAST,

16:25.918 --> 16:27.554
YOU KNOW, I COULD--
I COULD

16:27.654 --> 16:29.322
DEAL WITH THEM.

16:29.422 --> 16:33.060
SO SHE HELPED YOU
TAKE CARE OF YOUR PARENTS.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.263
SHE WAS SO YOUNG
TO BE A GRIEF COUNSELOR.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.399
WELL, SHE FELT MORE LIKE MY--
MY GIRLFRIEND.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.203
AND THE WAY I FELT
ABOUT IT WAS

16:43.303 --> 16:46.473
IF I HAD A GIRLFRIEND,
THEN I WAS, YOU KNOW,
I WAS OKAY.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.941
I WASN'T THE POOR KID
WITH THE ABSENT FATHER

16:49.042 --> 16:50.943
AND THE PITIFUL MOTHER--

16:51.044 --> 16:52.912
I MEAN, I WAS THAT KID.
YES, I WAS,

16:53.012 --> 16:57.550
BUT I WASN'T A COMPLETE FAILURE.
AT LEAST I HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.720
DID YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.955
BACK THEN NO.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.892
WE WERE 14.

17:05.992 --> 17:09.562
DIFFERENT TIMES,
NOT LIKE KIDS NOW.

17:09.662 --> 17:13.600
NO, IT WAS ANOTHER THREE YEARS
BEFORE WE HAD SEX.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.436
AFTER ALL THAT STUFF HAD
HAPPENED AND, YOU KNOW,

17:16.536 --> 17:20.140
I WAS OVER--
OVER EVERYTHING.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.009
WHAT WAS WAS IT
THAT HAPPENED?

17:23.110 --> 17:26.979
WELL, AFTER MY FATHER LEFT.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.716
AFTER YOUR FATHER...

17:29.816 --> 17:32.385
LEFT...

17:32.485 --> 17:35.355
YOU AND YOUR MOTHER
FOR ONE OF HIS PATIENTS?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.424
RIGHT.

17:37.524 --> 17:41.528
AND THEN MY MOTHER WENT
INTO THIS, LIKE REALLY...

17:42.895 --> 17:46.433
DEEP, UH, DEPRESSION.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.470
I REMEMBER
ONE CHRISTMAS EVE,

17:50.570 --> 17:53.406
TAMMY'S MOTHER INVITED US
TO COME OVER TO THE HOUSE

17:53.506 --> 17:57.144
AND, YOU KNOW, HER HUSBAND
HAD DIED THAT YEAR,

17:57.244 --> 17:59.179
BUT YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.782
SHE WAS THE STRONGEST WOMAN
I THINK I'VE EVER MET
IN MY LIFE.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.851
THEIR HOUSE WAS ALWAYS

18:04.951 --> 18:07.620
FULL OF LIGHT AND MUSIC.

18:09.356 --> 18:12.559
SHE WAS DETERMINED TO STAY ALIVE
FOR HER KIDS, THAT'S FOR SURE.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.595
- NOT LIKE YOUR MOTHER?
- NO, NOT LIKE MY MOTHER,

18:15.695 --> 18:20.467
WHO JUMPED INTO THE ABYSS
AND PULLED ME DOWN WITH HER.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.569
HMPH.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.341
SO ABOUT CHRISTMAS?

18:28.441 --> 18:31.644
YEAH, ANYWAY, CHRISTMAS.
CHRISTMAS EVE, TAMMY--

18:31.744 --> 18:34.881
TAMMY APPEARS AT THE DOOR.
SHE SAYS, "COME ON, COME ON."

18:34.981 --> 18:38.885
SO, UM, I--

18:38.985 --> 18:40.820
I SAID, "HANG ON
FOR A MINUTE."

18:40.920 --> 18:43.590
SO I WENT
INTO MY MOTHER'S ROOM

18:43.690 --> 18:45.958
TO SEE, YOU KNOW,
DID SHE WANT TO COME?

18:46.058 --> 18:48.328
BUT SHE WAS ASLEEP,

18:48.428 --> 18:51.998
SO I DECIDED I'D LEAVE
WITHOUT HER

18:52.098 --> 18:54.867
AND WE WENT OVER
TO TAMMY'S PLACE.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.937
IT WAS-- PFFT.

18:58.037 --> 19:02.074
IT WAS JUST AMAZING.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.411
TAMMY'S MOTHER HAD BAKED

19:04.511 --> 19:07.880
THIS GLAZED HAM
WITH THE PINEAPPLES AND CHERRIES

19:07.980 --> 19:10.116
AND THERE WERE
CHRISTMAS COOKIES

19:10.217 --> 19:11.718
AND PEOPLE
WERE DRINKING PUNCH

19:11.818 --> 19:16.689
AND EVERYBODY WAS SINGING
AND IT WAS JUST GREAT.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.459
SO THEN AFTERWARDS,
TAMMY AND I WENT TO HER ROOM.

19:19.559 --> 19:23.896
AND WE WERE JUST,
YOU KNOW, TALKING

19:23.996 --> 19:26.466
AND TALKING.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.206
I THINK THAT WAS

19:33.306 --> 19:35.542
WHEN I FIRST FELL
IN LOVE WITH HER.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.109
YOU KNOW?

19:37.210 --> 19:39.679
I THOUGHT SHE WAS...

19:39.779 --> 19:43.516
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURE
I HAD EVER SEEN.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.656
ANYWAY, SUDDENLY I
REMEMBERED MY MOTHER

19:49.756 --> 19:52.325
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
THAT SHE'D WAKE UP

19:52.425 --> 19:54.294
AND THAT SHE WOULDN'T
KNOW WHERE I WAS.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.496
SO I RAN OUT
OF TAMMY'S ROOM,

19:56.596 --> 20:00.667
- AND, UH--
- WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU GOT HOME?

20:02.134 --> 20:03.903
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER.

20:04.003 --> 20:08.074
FINDING MY MOTHER
UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR,
CALLING THE AMBULANCE,

20:08.174 --> 20:14.347
THE TRIP TO THE HOSPITAL--
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER ANY OF IT.

20:14.447 --> 20:18.851
YOU KNOW, FROM THE TIME I LEFT
TAMMY'S BEDROOM UNTIL I GOT
TO THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR,

20:18.951 --> 20:21.087
IT'S ALL JUST, LIKE,

20:21.187 --> 20:23.923
IT'S ALL A BLUR.
IT'S ALL MISSING.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.893
IT'S LIKE IT'S ERASED.

20:26.993 --> 20:30.997
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU
TRY AND REMEMBER THAT NIGHT.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.933
I CAN'T.
I HAVE TRIED.

20:35.468 --> 20:39.205
HUH-- MY MOTHER'S FIRST
SUICIDE ATTEMPT,

20:39.306 --> 20:42.642
THE MOST IMPORTANT NIGHT OF...

20:42.742 --> 20:45.177
THE MOST IMPORTANT
NIGHT OF MY LIFE,

20:45.278 --> 20:48.147
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.817
WHY WAS IT THE MOST IMPORTANT

20:50.917 --> 20:52.585
NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.421
BECAUSE IF I'D
STAYED WITH HER,

20:54.521 --> 20:56.122
SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE TRIED TO,

20:56.222 --> 20:59.626
YOU KNOW, KILL HERSELF.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.261
I KNOW IT TOOK YEARS
BEFORE SHE FINALLY DID IT,

21:02.362 --> 21:04.831
BUT THAT CHRISTMAS EVE

21:04.931 --> 21:07.367
WHEN I WASN'T THERE,

21:07.467 --> 21:09.336
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
SHE DID IT.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.371
THAT'S WHEN IT ALL STARTED.

21:11.471 --> 21:15.041
OH, PAUL, YOU WERE
A 14-YEAR-OLD KID.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.811
YOU HAD JUST HAD THE MOST
WONDERFUL NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE.

21:18.911 --> 21:23.650
- YEAH, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- IT DOES MATTER.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.620
SHE TOOK
YOUR WONDERFUL NIGHT
AWAY FROM YOU.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.223
SHE PUNISHED YOU
FOR NEGLECTING HER.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.793
SHE SHOWED YOU WHAT
DAMAGE SHE COULD DO

21:33.893 --> 21:38.297
IF YOU IGNORED HER,
IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF HER.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.733
AND IT WASN'T JUST
THE THREAT ON HER LIFE.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.269
BUT A THREAT ON MY LIFE AS WELL,
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?

21:43.370 --> 21:46.339
- YES.
- I WAS TOTALLY FINE.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.307
I MEAN, I WAS JUST
STANDING THERE

21:48.408 --> 21:51.077
IN THE HALL WITH
A STOMACHFUL OF COOKIES.

21:51.177 --> 21:54.614
SHE WAS THE ONE IN THE HOSPITAL
WITH THE TUBES STICKING
OUT OF HER ARMS,

21:54.714 --> 21:57.450
THE NURSES
RUNNING IN AND OUT.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.953
I WAS OUT ENJOYING MYSELF.
SHE WAS...

22:02.221 --> 22:04.357
SHE WAS ABOUT TO DIE.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.495
WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.466
I DON'T KNOW.

22:13.566 --> 22:18.505
ALL I KNOW IS I LEFT HER
FOR ONE NIGHT AND THAT WAS
THE NIGHT SHE DID IT.

22:18.605 --> 22:22.041
SO WHATEVER I WAS DOING
BEFORE THAT,

22:22.141 --> 22:24.043
OBVIOUSLY I WAS...

22:24.143 --> 22:26.379
I WAS HELPING HER.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.616
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU REMEMBER

22:29.716 --> 22:33.019
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU THAT NIGHT.

22:34.487 --> 22:38.825
BECAUSE MAYBE YOU'LL DISCOVER
SOMETHING MISSING.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.728
YOU KNOW, SOME DETAIL

22:41.828 --> 22:45.097
THAT'LL HELP YOU FEEL
LESS GUILTY.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.434
( exhales )
BUT I AM GUILTY.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.603
I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT YOU COULDN'T SAVE HER.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.239
JUST LIKE I KNOW FOR A FACT

22:53.339 --> 22:55.708
THAT YOU COULDN'T SAVE ALEX.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.478
BUT MY KNOWING THOSE THINGS
IS MEANINGLESS.

22:58.578 --> 23:01.681
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THEM.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.383
YOU DO.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.587
OKAY.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.523
SO YOU HAVE TO DO WHATEVER
IT IS YOU HAVE TO DO

23:10.623 --> 23:12.725
TO REMEMBER THAT NIGHT.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.864
OH, LIKE WHAT?
LIKE-- LIKE HYPNOSIS?

23:17.964 --> 23:20.399
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.778
OKAY.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.983
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.353
YEAH, AND THANKS.

23:41.454 --> 23:44.156
YOU'RE WELCOME.

23:55.502 --> 23:58.304
YES, HI, COULD I HAVE...

23:58.404 --> 24:00.573
