AT THE HOSPITAL
FOR TERMINATING.

IF HE WAS EVER CAUGHT
MAKING TROUBLE AGAIN,

28:24.403 --> 28:27.073
I'D KICK THE MURDERING LIFE
OUT OF HIM.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT, TOM.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.276
HE'S SURRENDERING.

LET'S GO.

30:09.475 --> 30:12.178
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
A STICK IN YOUR ARM.
DON'T MOVE.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.580
LISTEN,
I'M QUITTING, MAN.

30:14.613 --> 30:17.449
I'M GOING IN THE ARMY
WHERE IT'S SAFE.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.986
[ Grunting ]
I DON'T WANNA DIE.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.055
- NO, I WANNA DIE.
I'M THE ONE.
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.

[ Frank ]
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE HERE.

NOW, NONE OF THESE JUNKIES
WANNA GIVE MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.
IT WAS A BLOW DRYER.

31:19.445 --> 31:22.414
SO I PULLS IT OUT.
HIS BODY WAS COLD
EXCEPT FOR HIS THROAT.

31:22.448 --> 31:26.452
IT HAD BEEN BLOW-DRIED FOR AN
HOUR. JUNKIE HAD SECOND-DEGREE
BURNS OF THE TONGUE.

NOW, BABIES ARE A WHOLE
DIFFERENT THING ENTIRELY.

DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT THE TIME THAT

31:52.478 --> 31:56.315
I SAID, "MA'AM,
I'M A TRUE COCKSMAN,
AND I DON'T MIX MY SEED."

31:59.718 --> 32:02.388
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

MY BROTHER'S PROBLEM. THAT'S
WHY HE'S PASSED OUT INSIDE.

IT'S CRAZY IN THERE.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.777
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THAT DOCTOR...

32:58.810 --> 33:01.613
WHO KEEPS MUMBLING AND POKING
HIMSELF IN THE EYE
WHENEVER HE TALKS TO ME ?

HE'S WORKING
A DOUBLE SHIFT.

33:05.651 --> 33:09.388

HE'S IN A COMA.

IT'S LIKE, UH,
SHE'S IN A TRANCE.

33:17.263 --> 33:20.266
SHE SHOULD GO HOME.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.769
YEAH, WELL, I'D TAKE HER,
BUT SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO STAY HERE.

DID YOU SEE HIM ?
[ Mrs. Burke ]
IT WASN'T HIM.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.309
YOU SAW HIM ?

33:30.342 --> 33:33.645

IT WASN'T HIM.
IT WASN'T MY HUSBAND.

YOU SHOULD GO HOME NOW.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.650

[ Frank Narrating ]
SAVING SOMEONE'S LIFE
IS LIKE FALLING IN LOVE.

34:31.337 --> 34:33.539
THE BEST DRUG IN THE WORLD.

34:34.672 --> 34:37.643
FOR DAYS,
SOMETIMES WEEKS AFTERWARDS,

34:37.676 --> 34:41.780
YOU WALK THE STREET
MAKING INFINITE
WHATEVER YOU SEE.

34:43.681 --> 34:47.652
ONCE, FOR A FEW WEEKS,
I COULDN'T FEEL THE EARTH.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.188

IF YOU'VE BECOME IMMORTAL,

YOUR OWN LIFE AS WELL.

THAT FOR A MOMENT THERE--

35:06.672 --> 35:11.677
WHY DENY FOR A MOMENT THERE

35:15.814 --> 35:19.885
TAKING CREDIT
WHEN THINGS GO RIGHT
DOESN'T WORK THE OTHER WAY.

35:19.918 --> 35:25.291

SPREADING THE BLAME IS AN
ESSENTIAL MEDIC SURVIVAL TOOL.

"THE BOYFRIEND WAS CRAZY."

"I SHOULD'VE CALLED IN SICK."
"THE TUBE WOULDN'T GO IN."
