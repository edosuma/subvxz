WEBVTT

00:38.439 --> 00:39.972
- Oh no.

00:39.974 --> 00:41.340
Oh fuck.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.908
Fuck!

00:42.910 --> 00:47.246
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fucking shit!

00:57.658 --> 00:59.291
- Relax druggie Dougie.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.627
- Don't fucking call me that.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.362
My name is Doug, or Douglas.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.197
I'm a fucking adult!

01:05.199 --> 01:08.500
- I believe he's trying
to assert his authority.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.503
- Are you trying to
assert your authority?

01:11.505 --> 01:14.640
- Maybe he thinks
he's in charge here.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.976
- Do you think you're in
charge here, druggie Dougie?

01:17.978 --> 01:19.011
- Don't fuckin'...

01:22.783 --> 01:25.117
- What did I say?

01:25.119 --> 01:28.353
- He said to relax
druggie Dougie.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.156
- I did.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.425
I said to relax.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.893
Right?

01:34.895 --> 01:36.361
- What do you want from me?

01:36.363 --> 01:40.132
- We want to see how much
you love your new God?

01:40.134 --> 01:43.502
- Are you familiar
with Yubitsume?

01:43.504 --> 01:48.574
- Yeah, it's that brown chicken
dish at fucking Benihana.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.512
- No Doug, it's a ritual
practiced by the Yakuza.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.915
Yubitsume is a form of apology.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.618
If a member of the Yakuza
were to dishonor himself

01:59.620 --> 02:03.288
or one of his bosses he'd
be required to perform it.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.492
- Perform what?

02:06.494 --> 02:09.828
- He'd be asked to use this.

02:11.098 --> 02:15.734
- To cut the tip of
his pinky finger off.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.710
- Fuck, fuck you guys.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.713
I'm not cutting the fucking
tip of my finger off!

02:27.715 --> 02:30.816
- Oh that's up to
you druggie Dougie.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.052
- Yes, we're not the low
life drug addicts here.

02:34.054 --> 02:38.056
- This stuff, this
means nothing to us.

02:39.226 --> 02:42.094
- We just as soon flush
it down the toilet.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.962
- We would.

02:43.964 --> 02:47.332
But we know you
wouldn't like that.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.469
- You're what they
call a super addict.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.471
And besides we're only
asking for a pinky

02:52.473 --> 02:53.739
you big baby.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.741
- It's gonna hurt
like fucking shit!

02:55.743 --> 02:56.808
- Wow.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.047
It really only tickles a little.

03:02.049 --> 03:05.017
- And you'll have that
sweet, sweet crack

03:05.019 --> 03:07.553
to take the edge off.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.955
And then we'll drive
you to a hospital,

03:09.957 --> 03:13.825
they'll patch you
up neat and tidy.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.430
- This is, this
is fucking fucked.

03:18.432 --> 03:22.167
- So is chemical
dependance, but here we are.

03:22.169 --> 03:25.437
And you've certainly
dishonored yourself.

03:25.439 --> 03:29.808
So I can't think of a
more apropos way to atone.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.615
- Just the tip, right?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.417
- That's all.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.853
- So what do you
say druggie Dougie,

03:41.855 --> 03:45.891
pinky or no pinky?

03:47.161 --> 03:48.360
- And you fuckers
are going to take me

03:48.362 --> 03:49.595
to the hospital right
afterwards, right?

03:49.597 --> 03:51.697
- My golden word of honor.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.970
- Let's up the ante a
little bit, shall we?

04:00.741 --> 04:04.943
Odds are you've never seen
a kilo of cocaine before,

04:04.945 --> 04:08.180
so feast your eyes.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.216
- It's still Yubitsume.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.918
- But...

04:15.489 --> 04:17.822
You do have to use this.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.158
- Fuck.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.927
Oh and how the fuck
am I supposed to

04:21.928 --> 04:24.129
cut my finger off with a rock!?

04:24.131 --> 04:26.465
- Figure it out.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.602
That's your problem
druggie Dougie.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.338
- Or you can go for the

04:33.340 --> 04:36.208
small package instead

04:36.210 --> 04:40.912
and just use the knife
like a little bitch.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.218
Shall we count?

04:48.989 --> 04:49.788
- Fuck it!

04:49.790 --> 04:50.856
- You got this Doug!

04:54.561 --> 04:55.327
- It hurts!

04:55.329 --> 04:56.428
- Go, go, go!

04:56.430 --> 04:57.095
- It fucking hurts!

04:57.097 --> 04:58.330
It hurts!

04:58.332 --> 05:01.266
- Just severe the bone
and you're all free!

05:01.268 --> 05:03.769
Oh do it Doug!

05:03.771 --> 05:04.771
One more!

05:08.809 --> 05:10.942
- Wow!

05:10.944 --> 05:12.911
Oh my God!

05:12.913 --> 05:16.181
Douglas, I am impressed.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.749
Unbelievable.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.986
You were right.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.356
- See I told you, drug
addicts will do anything.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.791
- Help!

05:25.793 --> 05:28.293
- Well I am a man of my word,
you won fair and square.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.295
- Thank you.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.200
- What the fuck is that about?

05:35.202 --> 05:38.670
- Oh you see, I bet a dollar
that you would use the rock,

05:38.672 --> 05:41.273
but Charles here, he
thought you'd puss out

05:41.275 --> 05:42.507
and go for the knife.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.644
- You bet on me you
yuppie assholes!

05:48.248 --> 05:49.715
What's so funny!?

05:51.285 --> 05:53.452
- It's powdered
sugar druggie Dougie.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.887
- And the packet was rock salt.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.928
- You fucking dick holes.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.129
Fuck you.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.032
Just take me to the
hospital please.

06:08.168 --> 06:12.237
- Now where are our
keys druggie Dougie?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.275
- If they've been snakes...

06:17.277 --> 06:20.812
- They would've
bitten me, I know.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.485
- You can't walk away from me.

06:27.621 --> 06:32.324
- Have to dash druggie
Dougie, it's been fun.

06:32.326 --> 06:35.527
- Don't you fucking
leave me here!

06:35.529 --> 06:38.764
Fucking help me!

08:04.585 --> 08:07.285
- Mother, are you decent?

08:07.287 --> 08:10.889
- When am I ever not decent?

08:17.064 --> 08:21.032
Are you trying to imply
I'm not a lady, Charlie?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.635
- Of course not mother.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.670
How did you sleep?

08:25.672 --> 08:27.305
- Terribly.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.175
Oh, if I could
move without pain,

08:32.679 --> 08:35.813
I would've tossed
and turned all night.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.884
- I'm sorry to hear that.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.156
You are still beautiful though.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.158
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.996
- Am I still your favorite girl?

08:50.998 --> 08:53.198
- Forever and ever.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.668
- You sure got that
look sweetheart.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.170
- Thank you mother.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.573
- What time is it?

09:01.575 --> 09:06.645
Oh, would you get my
medicine for me baby.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.748
- I'd be glad to sweets.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.683
- Thank you.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.754
I had the weirdest
dream last night.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.222
- You don't say.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.825
- Yeah, I was standing
in the middle of the road

09:20.827 --> 09:23.995
watching this horribly
disfigured man

09:23.997 --> 09:26.631
being pulled out of a car wreck.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.634
And guess what?

09:29.636 --> 09:30.969
- What?

09:30.971 --> 09:35.807
It started to rain rose petals.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.909
Isn't that the damnedest thing?

09:37.911 --> 09:41.279
And to top it off the
police and the paramedics

09:41.281 --> 09:45.016
around the wreck stopped
pulling the guy out

09:46.587 --> 09:51.356
and started dancing around
like it was a Broadway musical.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.091
- Then what?

09:53.093 --> 09:57.395
- Then my son called me
indecent and here we are.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.097
- Oh hush.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.470
Do you know what
Freud would say?

10:05.472 --> 10:09.874
- Oh who gives two wooden
nickels what Freud would say.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.979
That's all psychobabble anyway.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.014
- Probably true.

10:16.016 --> 10:20.151
It's all just a series
of dreamed up notions.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.887
- Barely 11 am,

10:22.889 --> 10:27.325
and Freud is the
topic of discussion.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.927
I'm missing out.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.629
- Good morning, Thomas.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.298
- Good morning mumsie.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.900
- You two were out
late last night.

10:35.902 --> 10:39.771
I hope you weren't
getting into any trouble.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.507
- Not in the least.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.809
- Is that true?

10:44.811 --> 10:47.412
- Yes, of course.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.148
- Good.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.684
- Charles.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.421
Breakfast.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.425
- Have a good day.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.694
- You too mother.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.267
- Hmm.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.015
- Is there anything in there?

11:24.017 --> 11:25.650
- About what?

11:25.652 --> 11:27.752
- About last night.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.822
- Oh I'm sure our friend
Dougie either bled to death

11:30.824 --> 11:34.526
in a gutter somewhere or
he patched himself up.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.829
Also, do me a favor.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.998
Never bring up Doug again.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.467
Better for all of us.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.371
- Of course.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.439
I'm sorry.

11:47.441 --> 11:50.842
- No, never be sorry.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.477
You know that.

11:52.479 --> 11:56.181
Sorry is a sign of
weakness Charles,

11:56.183 --> 11:58.550
and that is one thing
we cannot afford to be.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.018
- More coffee guys?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.320
- Please.
- Please.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.628
- Genevieve, what a pretty name.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.163
- Thank you.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.266
I actually pronounce it
Genevieve, sounds fancier.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.968
- You're new here.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.738
- Yeah, just started
yesterday actually.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.940
- Well we're a
couple of regulars,

12:21.942 --> 12:24.809
so we'll be seeing
lots of each other.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.479
- Oh, great.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.914
- I'm Thomas, and this
less handsome devil

12:29.916 --> 12:34.285
with the pancake in his
mouth is my brother Charles.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.922
- Oh, I'm sorry, hello.

12:37.924 --> 12:41.926
- Hi, I'm Genevieve, again.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.362
- Mommy.

12:44.364 --> 12:48.466
- And that's my
daughter, Maddie.

12:48.468 --> 12:52.170
Well you guys need a fill
up just give a shout.

12:57.177 --> 13:01.880
- Now that's a kind of
woman man was made to ruin.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.048
Genevieve.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.253
You look like you
could use a fill up.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.956
You could.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.738
- Thomas.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.007
Thomas.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.509
Thomas!

13:31.511 --> 13:34.012
You're creaming
all over the place.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.748
Did you go away for a moment?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.686
- She's got some big hips.

13:44.758 --> 13:48.493
It's a good sign of
a healthy uterus.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.461
- Can we please go
one day without you

13:50.463 --> 13:52.597
using the word uterus?

13:52.599 --> 13:55.400
- It's my very
favorite word, Charles,

13:55.402 --> 13:57.936
can't help myself.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.107
I'm in the mood
for a movie today.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.375
You?

14:12.385 --> 14:14.786
We should get a hooker.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.087
- What?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.088
- Did you put salt in this?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.056
- A little.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.357
- Doesn't taste like a little.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.859
- What about the hooker?

14:20.861 --> 14:22.360
- Oh, we should get one.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.228
- Why?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.330
- Because it's time.

14:25.332 --> 14:30.134
- So, so we're really
going to do it?

14:30.136 --> 14:31.903
You think we're ready?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.773
- You're not chickening
out on me, are you?

14:35.775 --> 14:37.175
- No.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.746
I just didn't think we
were ready, that's all.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.615
- We're ready.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.818
We've tested ourselves,
and we've tested others.

14:46.820 --> 14:50.154
I say we just push forward.

14:50.156 --> 14:53.157
- So what do we do, just
call up an escort service?

14:53.159 --> 14:54.626
And then what?

14:54.628 --> 14:56.127
- No, no you idiot, we don't
just call up an escort service.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.229
That leaves a paper trail.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.832
You're supposed to have
the higher IQ here, right?

15:00.834 --> 15:04.502
- So what, we just pick up
a girl off of the street?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.537
- Yes, we just pick up
a girl off the street,

15:06.539 --> 15:08.039
take her to a motel.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.741
- Oh, motel?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.876
Isn't that leaving a trail?

15:11.878 --> 15:13.811
- We pay cash, she
books the room,

15:13.813 --> 15:15.914
no one sees us with her.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.181
- All right.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.684
Also we should rent a
car, so their hooker...

15:19.686 --> 15:20.718
- No.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.820
I don't leave paper.

15:22.822 --> 15:25.123
We'll borrow our mother's car.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.558
She won't be needing it anyway.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.363
- What kind of girl
should we get then?

15:32.365 --> 15:35.500
- Any kind, doesn't
matter to me.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.069
It's all the same meat
in the end anyway.

15:38.071 --> 15:41.706
- Would you two dick holes
please shut the fuck up!?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.041
I'm trying to watch the film.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.842
Just shut up!

15:47.013 --> 15:49.614
- We're not animals, Charles.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.217
Though he is on the list.

15:58.892 --> 16:01.592
- It shouldn't just be
any kind of girl though.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.097
She should be special.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.267
- Okay.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.803
So you pick.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.405
It really doesn't matter to me.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.110
- Your indifference
is suffocating.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.313
- My indifference
is justifiable.

16:23.683 --> 16:27.051
No one's gonna care one eye
about any of these girls.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.687
Pretty or not.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.595
- That one.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.964
- That gaudy one?

16:39.966 --> 16:41.899
She's decrepit Charles.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.234
Why her?

16:45.905 --> 16:48.272
- She's beautiful.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.543
She looks like mother.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.314
- All right.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.257
Legs.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.502
- Evening boys.

17:17.503 --> 17:19.971
How can I help you?

17:19.973 --> 17:24.175
- Well my brother and I
have carefully selected you

17:24.176 --> 17:26.477
for tonight's indulgence.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.212
- Selected me?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.114
Both of ya?

17:31.351 --> 17:33.618
You wouldn't happen
to be cops, would ya?

17:33.620 --> 17:38.523
- Oh no ma'am, just regular
red blooded American horn dogs.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.526
- Yeah, I can see that.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.362
- I'm Drew, and this is Hank.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.432
- Nice to meet
ya, Drew and Hank.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.233
I'm Vanity.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.536
- Is that your real name?

17:51.538 --> 17:54.472
- No, of course it's not
my real fuckin' name.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.608
- So are we gonna party or what?

17:57.610 --> 18:00.178
- I'll just get my purse.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.958
We could've gone some
place nice, you know?

18:13.960 --> 18:17.962
- Dirty places for dirty
things, I always say.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.399
- I'm gonna go freshen up.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.739
- How should we do it?

18:28.741 --> 18:31.342
- You wanna sleep
with her, don't you?

18:31.344 --> 18:36.080
We can't rape her Charles,
it'll leave semen behind.

18:36.082 --> 18:39.283
Even with a condom
it wouldn't be safe.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.652
- Did you smell her?

18:41.654 --> 18:46.257
Her scent, she stinks
off cooked meat.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.160
- That's because it's
not meat brother,

18:49.162 --> 18:53.498
that is the smell of impurity.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.336
- So how should we do it then?

18:58.338 --> 19:02.473
- Let's just roll with the
punches and see what develops.

19:04.444 --> 19:08.746
- So what do you
two little pervs

19:08.748 --> 19:10.615
wanna do with me tonight?

19:10.617 --> 19:12.617
- A great many things.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.020
- You don't have
to call me ma'am.

19:16.022 --> 19:19.790
I'm your whore,
not your librarian.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.660
Now I can be if you want to.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.798
So we ridin' solo or tag team?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.867
I don't do anal, usually.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.236
Though I can be
financially coerced.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.404
I don't swallow...

19:33.406 --> 19:35.740
- This is a nonsmoking room.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.075
- Seriously?

19:38.077 --> 19:40.278
- Cigarettes are the
leading cause of death

19:40.280 --> 19:42.246
in the United States.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.683
- Okie doke.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.021
Well you boys are in
charge, so let's...

19:50.023 --> 19:51.556
- Oh no, no.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.759
You're in charge tonight.

19:54.761 --> 19:58.896
We want you to take the reigns.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.534
- I like your style Blondie.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.736
You can come first.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.989
Do you like what you see?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.493
I've always wanted to
be a ballet dancer.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.096
- Yet you became a prostitute.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.998
- Well life's what
happens when you're busy

20:34.000 --> 20:35.600
making other plans.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.702
Isn't that the bullshit saying.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.771
Like God works in
mysterious ways, whatever.

20:40.773 --> 20:45.676
- How many sexual partners
have you had Vanity?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.111
- Many.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.181
Too many.

20:50.183 --> 20:53.317
- What would your mother
think about all this Vanity?

20:53.319 --> 20:55.820
- She'd say I hope those two

20:55.822 --> 20:59.890
sexy brothers tip well dear.

21:02.195 --> 21:04.362
You know what's funny?

21:04.364 --> 21:08.799
This is actually
my biggest fantasy.

21:08.801 --> 21:13.070
Well not exactly,
but close enough.

21:14.207 --> 21:16.240
- What are you doing?

21:17.610 --> 21:21.746
I'm gonna suck your cock,
is that okay with you?

21:49.242 --> 21:51.008
Gimme a chance to warm up!

21:51.010 --> 21:52.376
- Get off me!

21:52.378 --> 21:53.544
You disgust me.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.712
- You fucker!

21:54.714 --> 21:56.113
- Thomas what are you doing!?

21:56.115 --> 21:57.448
- She's not the one!

21:57.450 --> 22:00.051
- Not the one, what,
what do you mean!?

22:00.053 --> 22:02.386
- She's so impure, she's rotten!

22:02.388 --> 22:04.955
She can't be our first.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.891
- I'm your first?

22:09.429 --> 22:11.162
- Thomas wait up!

22:14.901 --> 22:16.400
Thomas!

22:16.402 --> 22:17.702
- Get away from me Charles.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.236
- Thomas.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.305
Hey, I'm talking to you.

22:21.307 --> 22:22.907
Hey, what happened!?

22:22.909 --> 22:24.742
- She wasn't pure!

22:26.546 --> 22:29.046
She wasn't pure, Charles.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.416
She was a piece of
garbage nothing.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.352
It was all wrong.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.420
- All wrong?

22:36.422 --> 22:37.922
How is it all wrong?

22:37.924 --> 22:41.292
We knew what she was before
we ever walked into that room.

22:41.294 --> 22:44.462
- No, no.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.398
You see, it's the wrong tack.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.600
We're going about it all wrong.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.535
- Are we?

22:51.537 --> 22:54.105
Or did you just lose your spine?

22:54.107 --> 22:55.206
- What did you to say to me?

22:55.208 --> 22:56.474
What the hell did you say to me?

22:56.476 --> 22:58.342
Don't you ever!

22:58.344 --> 22:59.744
- I'm sorry.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.079
- Don't you ever say
that to me again!

23:02.081 --> 23:04.949
I did not lose my
spine you idiot!

23:04.951 --> 23:07.118
How could you not see
that she wasn't right?

23:07.120 --> 23:09.820
Or you're too stupid
to understand?

23:09.822 --> 23:11.622
- How wasn't she right?

23:11.624 --> 23:15.426
We were supposed to kill her,
not put her on a pedestal.

23:15.428 --> 23:18.129
- That's exactly
my point Charles.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.664
We should put them
on a pedestal.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.933
At least our first one.

23:22.935 --> 23:27.104
It shouldn't be some thrown
away street trash tramp,

23:27.106 --> 23:30.841
it should be someone who's
death would mean something.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.944
Hookers get killed all the time.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.546
Life goes on.

23:35.548 --> 23:39.683
We need them to
remember what we do

23:39.685 --> 23:41.786
and who we do it to.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.625
- Well, we could've
just strung her up

23:47.627 --> 23:49.593
and made it look like
Jack the Ripper got to her

23:49.595 --> 23:50.828
and that would've made ink.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.630
- Nooo!

23:56.068 --> 24:01.138
Keep in mind this
is an experiment,

24:02.175 --> 24:03.307
a test of the superior
intellect versus

24:03.309 --> 24:05.576
the weak minded cattle.

24:05.578 --> 24:09.914
For it to lead to transcendence
it's got to mean something!

24:09.916 --> 24:14.785
But for it to mean something
we must also make it art.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.889
It must be a defiant act
of our above all else.

24:19.992 --> 24:23.327
The victims are as much
part of it as we are.

24:23.329 --> 24:26.163
They are the canvas Charles.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.398
- Don't worry.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.132
- And we...

24:28.134 --> 24:29.066
- You will live.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.634
- Are the goddamn paintbrushes.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.506
- I saw the light coming
out from underneath the door

24:35.508 --> 24:37.842
and figured you were awake.

24:37.844 --> 24:42.913
- Yeah, I'm having
trouble sleeping.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.949
- Anything I can do?

24:46.085 --> 24:48.786
- Tuck me in, sing me a song?

24:49.922 --> 24:51.188
- Okay.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.799
- You look worried.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.134
Is everything all right?

25:05.638 --> 25:06.804
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.839
Just got a lot on my mind.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.509
- You know I can
read you like a book.

25:11.511 --> 25:14.211
Something isn't right.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.113
- There's nothing.

25:17.250 --> 25:20.451
- We're supposed to tell
each other everything.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.220
No secrets.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.523
Is it Thomas?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.424
He's weak and...

25:27.426 --> 25:28.859
- No mother.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.130
Everything is fine.

25:33.132 --> 25:37.234
- Hmm, boy wasn't
that the look you got.

25:38.471 --> 25:43.541
- Let's see, what song
would you like to hear?

25:45.411 --> 25:49.480
- Well I could use
a little sunshine.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.883
- You got it.

25:57.890 --> 26:02.426
♪ Sunshine baby ♪

26:02.428 --> 26:05.596
♪ It's sunshine ♪

26:07.433 --> 26:11.769
♪ Time to wake up baby ♪

26:18.711 --> 26:23.714
♪ Oh it's sunshine baby ♪

26:24.784 --> 26:27.551
♪ All for you ♪

26:31.691 --> 26:34.224
- Good evening stranger.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.160
- Hey Genevieve.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.995
- You remembered?

26:39.532 --> 26:43.233
Sit wherever, it's
super dead tonight.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.069
- I will if you join me.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.370
- Um.

26:54.513 --> 26:58.749
Cookie dough's my favorite,
but we don't carry it.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.352
- I've never really been
a big fan of cookie dough.

27:01.354 --> 27:02.820
- Most guys aren't.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.955
Maybe it's a girl thing.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.459
- So I guess your
husband doesn't mind you

27:08.461 --> 27:10.594
working the graveyard shift.

27:10.596 --> 27:13.330
- I'm not married.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.432
- Oh, I figured since.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.167
- Getting pregnant
and getting married

27:17.169 --> 27:19.370
can be mutually exclusive.

27:19.372 --> 27:21.438
It was just a

27:23.109 --> 27:25.109
stupid time in my life.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.065
I don't regret
having my daughter.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.215
I love my little Maddie.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.086
- You have a tattoo.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.722
- Oh yeah.

27:38.724 --> 27:41.258
Souvenir from the old days.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.461
- It's beautiful.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.764
- Thanks.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.532
Maddie likes it.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.969
So tell me about yourself.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.704
What do you do?

27:53.706 --> 27:55.739
What do you like?

27:59.612 --> 28:01.311
You okay?

28:01.313 --> 28:05.315
- Yeah, nervous twitch I guess.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.418
- Are you nervous?

28:08.320 --> 28:11.522
- Well yes.

28:11.524 --> 28:15.192
After all I am all alone
with a very strange woman

28:15.194 --> 28:18.996
and there's no telling
what you'll do to me.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.198
- You're safe in my hands.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.402
- Good to know.

28:28.607 --> 28:31.909
- So what about your
brother, what does he do?

28:31.911 --> 28:33.510
- He's a writer.

28:33.512 --> 28:36.213
He wants to write
true crime books,

28:36.215 --> 28:38.549
he's fascinated by death.

28:38.551 --> 28:41.585
- Oh, I couldn't do that.

28:41.587 --> 28:42.753
There's enough
ugliness in the world

28:42.755 --> 28:45.155
to go digging for more.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.559
Back to work.

28:48.561 --> 28:50.394
Grab a seat, I'll
be right with you.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.096
- Are you seeing anyone?

28:53.866 --> 28:55.666
I am sorry.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.136
I didn't mean to blurt
that out just then,

28:59.138 --> 29:02.573
it's just I was
wondering if maybe

29:02.575 --> 29:05.976
you'd like to go with me
to the movies sometime.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.146
- Are you into chick flicks?

29:09.148 --> 29:11.515
- Not particularly, no.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.220
- Too bad, you'll learn.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.747
That was funny.

29:52.525 --> 29:54.691
- You're glowing.

29:56.529 --> 29:58.061
- I am?

29:59.598 --> 30:02.166
- It's blinding.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.934
- Thanks.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.871
- May I?

30:07.873 --> 30:09.439
- What?

30:09.441 --> 30:12.543
- I want to hold your hand.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.945
- Oh, sure.

30:27.893 --> 30:29.526
- I can feel it.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.596
- What did you say?

30:32.598 --> 30:35.332
- Oh, nothing.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.769
I'm sorry.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.318
- You have any cocoa chocolates?

30:54.320 --> 30:56.186
- We got movie shit.

30:58.123 --> 31:00.023
- That was actually really good.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.025
- I would go with the
definition of trite.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.962
- You're kidding,
it was so sweet.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.830
- Oh hey, you two!

31:06.832 --> 31:08.265
- Hi!

31:08.267 --> 31:10.267
- I didn't know you
were seeing this movie.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.202
Wasn't it good?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.871
- I know, and the ending.

31:13.873 --> 31:15.172
- Who would've
thought he'd make it

31:15.174 --> 31:16.907
to the altar after
all those mishaps?

31:16.909 --> 31:17.975
Right?

31:17.977 --> 31:18.876
- Right!

31:18.878 --> 31:20.277
It was so good.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.346
- What did you think Charles?

31:22.348 --> 31:27.417
- Um, I thought it was okay.

31:27.820 --> 31:28.986
- Okay.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.287
This is the man who'd
argue the merits

31:30.289 --> 31:32.990
of Bela Tarr's films
versus Bergman's work

31:32.992 --> 31:36.693
and all he can say
is it was okay.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.696
- Some films only
deserve an okay.

31:39.698 --> 31:43.033
Can't like all art, it
would defeat the purpose

31:43.035 --> 31:45.769
of personal intent
and free will.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.905
- Well put sir.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.708
Ugh, goddamn battery.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.211
Charles do you mind if
I borrow your phone?

31:54.213 --> 31:55.612
My mom's watching Maddie.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.514
I didn't really tell
her I was gonna be.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.650
- He doesn't have a
cell phone actually.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.120
- It can lead to brain cancer.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.322
- Though we do have
a phone at home

32:05.324 --> 32:08.091
just right around
the corner from here.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.261
- Oh, maybe I
should just go home.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.796
I gotta work tonight.

32:12.798 --> 32:15.198
- Don't be a silly goose,
come on over for lunch.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.500
I'm an excellent cook.

32:16.502 --> 32:19.603
Hey, you like pasta, huh?

32:19.605 --> 32:20.704
- I love pasta.

32:20.706 --> 32:21.905
- Fantastic!

32:21.907 --> 32:24.107
Stay for an hour, Charles here,

32:24.109 --> 32:25.342
he'll take you home.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.277
You know what, call
Maddie, call your mom,

32:27.279 --> 32:28.612
bring the whole clan over.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.181
I'm part Italian, we
love big gatherings.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.617
What do you say?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.185
Huh?

32:35.187 --> 32:36.187
- Okay!

32:40.793 --> 32:42.859
- Welcome to our home.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.604
Wow.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.210
- Just make yourself at home.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.546
Phone has been on the fritz.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.281
I'm just gonna go
get my cell phone,

33:04.283 --> 33:06.416
I don't really care
about brain cancer.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.352
- Okay.

33:15.761 --> 33:18.228
- What were you
doing at the theater?

33:18.230 --> 33:20.163
Spying on us?

33:20.165 --> 33:22.299
- She's perfect.

33:22.301 --> 33:25.002
- What are you talking about?

33:25.004 --> 33:26.970
- Don't play dumb Charles.

33:26.972 --> 33:30.807
She's beautiful, she's kind,

33:30.809 --> 33:33.610
she's loved by those around her

33:33.612 --> 33:35.045
she even is a mother.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.880
She's so bloody perfect.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.215
- No.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.552
No, I don't think so.

33:43.422 --> 33:45.722
- You don't think so?

33:45.724 --> 33:47.991
Then why were you going
out with her today

33:47.993 --> 33:50.927
if you weren't
testing the waters?

33:53.799 --> 33:56.266
I'll be a monkey's uncle,

33:57.569 --> 34:00.237
you like this girl.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.972
You honest to God
and the baby angels

34:01.974 --> 34:03.874
actually like this girl!?

34:03.876 --> 34:06.009
- She glows.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.878
- What about me?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.279
What about your big brother?

34:09.281 --> 34:11.882
What am I supposed to
do when you kick me

34:11.884 --> 34:14.451
to the curb for this,
for this woman!?

34:14.453 --> 34:17.054
What do you even know about her?

34:17.056 --> 34:18.822
- Okay.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.291
- You know she's probably
as loose as Vanity?

34:21.293 --> 34:24.360
All women are the same Charles.

34:24.362 --> 34:27.030
You and I need to remain pure.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.799
Have you forgotten that!?

34:28.801 --> 34:31.301
- Okay, okay.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.103
- What do you want me to do?

34:33.105 --> 34:35.739
You're breaking my
heart here Charles.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.007
Am I supposed to
just give up on you?

34:38.010 --> 34:39.909
Because I won't.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.978
You're my baby brother
and it's my job

34:41.980 --> 34:43.179
to keep you safe.

34:43.181 --> 34:47.016
- I said okay.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.819
- Atta boy.

34:53.158 --> 34:54.757
You know...

34:56.795 --> 35:00.163
She is a pretty little
thing, isn't she?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.667
Maybe it wouldn't
be a half bad idea

35:03.669 --> 35:05.302
to marry a gal like that.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.737
- Kill her Thomas.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.207
- Who needs the headache?

35:10.209 --> 35:14.044
If she glows like you
say, she's the one.

35:14.046 --> 35:15.245
She's our canvas.

35:15.247 --> 35:17.214
- Okay fine.

35:17.983 --> 35:18.782
So how do we do...

35:18.784 --> 35:20.217
- Follow my lead.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.896
- Well as luck would have it,

35:35.734 --> 35:40.804
I can't really seem to
find the damn thing.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.508
- Oh, okay well
that's all right.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.476
They can do without
me for an hour or so.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.944
- Atta girl.

35:47.946 --> 35:52.082
Now let me occupy your mind with
some fettuccine of the gods.

35:52.084 --> 35:53.717
How does that sound?

35:53.719 --> 35:54.719
- Great.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.052
- Great.

35:56.054 --> 35:56.920
Shall we shrimp?

35:56.922 --> 35:57.754
You allergic?

35:57.756 --> 35:58.622
- Nuh-uh.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.757
- Let's shrimp.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.893
- Charlie!

36:03.729 --> 36:05.762
- Charles, mother beckons.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.464
- Is your mom here?

36:07.466 --> 36:09.332
- Sweetheart!

36:09.334 --> 36:12.969
- Yeah, she's, she's sick.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.506
I'll be right back.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.510
- Old lady problems.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.113
- You're not
being a bad boy are you?

36:23.115 --> 36:25.582
- No, no mother.

36:27.019 --> 36:31.154
- Thomas isn't doing things
he shouldn't be doing, is he?

36:31.156 --> 36:34.891
Putting ideas in your head
that shouldn't be put there.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.960
- No mother, I promise.

36:38.030 --> 36:41.064
- He's like a canker
sore, that boy.

36:43.135 --> 36:45.902
Always trying to be the big man.

36:47.773 --> 36:52.042
Oh, I'm sure glad
you got that look.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.882
Top me off, will
you honey bunch?

36:58.884 --> 37:00.850
- Of course mother.

37:02.721 --> 37:06.489
I want to try and get some sleep

37:07.626 --> 37:11.728
so you can have a
little peace and quiet

37:11.730 --> 37:13.964
with your friend.

37:23.609 --> 37:26.376
- So Charles tells me
you're into serial killers

37:26.378 --> 37:28.044
and things like that.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.679
- Mhm.

37:30.549 --> 37:33.283
I like the obscure ones,

37:33.285 --> 37:37.320
Earl Nelson, Henri Landru.

37:37.322 --> 37:41.391
To a degree I consider
them artists, geniuses.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.293
- Really?

37:44.129 --> 37:45.662
I don't know.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.964
I mean what would
possess someone

37:47.966 --> 37:50.900
to want to kill
another human being?

37:50.902 --> 37:55.438
I don't consider that genius,
I consider it insanity.

37:55.440 --> 37:59.342
- There are Neanderthals
everywhere, Genevieve.

37:59.344 --> 38:03.480
There are predators
and there are prey.

38:03.482 --> 38:08.051
The trick is to eat
before you're eaten.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.287
- Well maybe that's
true to a degree,

38:10.289 --> 38:13.256
but I don't think killing
should be admired.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.859
I certainly wouldn't
wanna live that way.

38:15.861 --> 38:18.295
- Then you will be swallowed up.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.196
Survival of the fittest.

38:20.198 --> 38:24.100
- Wow, life's already
swallowed me up.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.735
Best I can do now
is teach my daughter

38:25.737 --> 38:28.905
to be bigger and
better than mommy.

38:28.907 --> 38:32.776
- All parents want
that, most of them fail.

38:36.615 --> 38:39.716
- Has anyone ever told you
you sound like an asshole?

38:41.486 --> 38:44.087
- Not to my face, no.

38:45.524 --> 38:46.890
Thank you.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.997
- Oh my God.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.567
You are radiant.

38:59.371 --> 39:01.171
- Way to cover for your brother.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.872
- I mean it.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.275
You're glorious.

39:05.277 --> 39:07.510
- Okay, okay.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.447
Let's get this over with.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.151
- What are you doing?

39:15.153 --> 39:18.621
- We have been waiting for this

39:18.623 --> 39:21.291
for a very long time.

39:22.227 --> 39:23.626
- For what?

39:24.663 --> 39:26.329
- You.

39:26.331 --> 39:29.632
You, young lady,

39:29.634 --> 39:33.837
are gonna be our masterpiece.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.505
- Charles, tell him to back off.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.941
This shit ain't funny.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.209
- Funny?

39:40.011 --> 39:44.547
You think I'm playing around,

39:44.549 --> 39:47.050
Miss Genevieve?

39:47.052 --> 39:51.187
What kind of hoity-toity
shitty name is that?

39:51.189 --> 39:55.191
Stuck up bitches like you
are better off dead, I say.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.626
Charles, it's here...

39:59.698 --> 40:01.664
- Thomas!

40:03.702 --> 40:06.369
Thomas, Thomas, are you okay?

40:06.371 --> 40:08.772
Are you okay?

40:08.774 --> 40:10.707
Thomas?

40:10.709 --> 40:12.275
She's getting away.

40:12.277 --> 40:13.410
She's getting away, Thomas.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.577
Come on!

40:20.385 --> 40:22.786
- Someone help me, please.

40:27.159 --> 40:28.291
- She's suffering.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.560
It's so beautiful.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.494
- Charles?

40:31.496 --> 40:33.763
- Help me, help me.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.500
- Look at her, Thomas.

40:37.502 --> 40:38.168
- Go away.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.369
- Look at her.

40:39.371 --> 40:41.237
- Stop.

40:41.239 --> 40:42.806
Charles, please.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.108
Why are you doing this to me?

40:45.110 --> 40:48.011
- I'm not doing this to you.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.015
I'm doing this for you,

40:52.017 --> 40:54.584
because you're beautiful.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.187
- I didn't do anything to you.

40:58.757 --> 41:01.357
- You glowed.

41:02.894 --> 41:07.397
Because you are glorious.

41:59.084 --> 42:00.917
- Charles.

42:00.919 --> 42:01.919
Stop.

42:02.787 --> 42:04.854
God damn it, Charles, stop it.

42:04.856 --> 42:05.622
Leave her alone.

42:05.624 --> 42:06.823
She's dead.

42:19.771 --> 42:21.971
We took her face off.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.674
We took her God damn face off.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.976
What should we do?

42:28.780 --> 42:30.446
Oh Jesus.

42:49.634 --> 42:51.034
- It's beautiful.

42:52.470 --> 42:54.370
Thomas.

42:56.241 --> 42:59.108
It was a divine act.

43:00.045 --> 43:01.544
It was divine.

43:01.546 --> 43:03.746
The universe approves.

43:14.526 --> 43:16.759
Did you see when I told her

43:16.761 --> 43:19.028
it was because she was glorious?

43:20.398 --> 43:21.965
She smiled.

43:23.168 --> 43:26.069
Like she was giving
me permission.

43:26.071 --> 43:28.438
- She didn't fucking smile.

43:28.440 --> 43:31.774
Why did you keep
that damn thing?

43:32.978 --> 43:35.712
- It's one of my souvenirs.

43:38.016 --> 43:40.450
What's wrong with you?

43:42.687 --> 43:44.520
You're shaking.

43:45.423 --> 43:46.589
- Nothing.

43:46.591 --> 43:48.024
Forget it.

43:48.026 --> 43:51.060
- Thomas, I know you.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.262
What's wrong?

43:53.264 --> 43:55.264
I mean...

43:55.266 --> 43:57.634
We pulled it off.

43:59.471 --> 44:02.071
We did it, you know?

44:02.073 --> 44:03.172
- Yeah.

44:03.174 --> 44:04.941
We did it.

44:08.113 --> 44:10.213
The problem is...

44:11.883 --> 44:13.716
I didn't like it.

44:15.920 --> 44:19.022
It shouldn't have
been like that.

44:25.363 --> 44:28.698
- What should it have been like?

44:30.001 --> 44:31.034
- I don't know.

44:31.036 --> 44:32.602
I don't fucking know.

44:32.604 --> 44:34.404
- You don't have
to curse, Thomas,

44:34.406 --> 44:35.805
there's not need for that.

44:35.807 --> 44:38.107
- I don't have to fucking curse?

44:38.109 --> 44:40.109
Fuck you, Charles.

44:40.111 --> 44:42.045
It shouldn't have
felt like that.

44:42.047 --> 44:43.680
- Like what?

44:46.885 --> 44:48.151
- Pity.

44:51.956 --> 44:53.623
I felt,

44:54.993 --> 44:57.226
sorry for her.

45:02.434 --> 45:04.233
- Well.

45:07.472 --> 45:09.772
I'm sorry to hear you say that.

45:24.589 --> 45:27.256
- Swinberg, long time no see.

45:27.258 --> 45:28.291
Hey!

45:29.994 --> 45:31.060
How are the kids.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.862
- I don't have children.

45:32.864 --> 45:34.597
- I meant you're balls, pal.

45:34.599 --> 45:36.299
You have testicle cancer, right?

45:36.301 --> 45:38.034
- Yeah, how did you...

45:38.036 --> 45:38.968
Right.

45:38.970 --> 45:40.536
They're fine.

45:40.538 --> 45:41.971
They're in remission.

45:41.973 --> 45:42.972
- So, I'm coming in late here.

45:42.974 --> 45:43.840
Fill me in.

45:43.842 --> 45:46.209
- Female, age 26.

45:49.481 --> 45:51.647
- Jesus, what is this, man?

45:51.649 --> 45:53.116
- We found her off
the side of the road,

45:53.118 --> 45:54.550
off Cold Water Canyon.

45:54.552 --> 45:57.353
Someone took a rock to her face,

45:57.355 --> 45:58.821
multiple times.

45:58.823 --> 46:00.356
- Rock for sure?

46:00.358 --> 46:01.591
- Well, we couldn't find it.

46:01.593 --> 46:04.393
But, all the rock
debris in her wounds

46:04.395 --> 46:07.830
is consistent with a rock
as the murder weapon.

46:07.832 --> 46:08.931
- No prints on her?

46:08.933 --> 46:10.032
- No, she was clean.

46:10.034 --> 46:11.267
We're still waiting on fibers,

46:11.269 --> 46:13.369
but the site wasn't
exactly pristine,

46:13.371 --> 46:15.037
so it may take a while.

46:15.039 --> 46:17.140
Also, we found a
patch of skin missing

46:17.142 --> 46:18.841
behind her right ear.

46:18.843 --> 46:20.643
It looks hastily removed.

46:20.645 --> 46:22.612
Probably a trophy piece.

46:22.614 --> 46:24.647
- Of course it was.

46:24.649 --> 46:27.350
He probably framed it too.

46:30.855 --> 46:32.688
Okay, darling.

46:34.058 --> 46:37.560
Let's see if we can't find
out who did this to you.

46:49.274 --> 46:50.740
- Up for a movie?

46:51.743 --> 46:53.209
I'm in the mood.

46:53.211 --> 46:54.510
- I'm not.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.251
- You can have it.

47:02.253 --> 47:05.221
I wasn't going to eat it anyway.

47:05.223 --> 47:05.888
- How did you know?

47:05.890 --> 47:06.890
- I saw it.

47:08.927 --> 47:12.461
I think I can see
everything now.

47:19.070 --> 47:20.002
- Sorry, boys.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.204
Didn't mean to startle you.

47:21.206 --> 47:22.338
May I cop a squat?

47:22.340 --> 47:23.272
Pun intended.

47:23.274 --> 47:26.275
- Of course, Officer.

47:26.277 --> 47:27.310
- It's Detective.

47:27.312 --> 47:29.111
Detective Homer Gaul.

47:29.113 --> 47:30.479
As long as we've got that clear,

47:30.481 --> 47:32.348
you can call me
Homer, we're pals.

47:32.350 --> 47:35.384
- Well, how can we
help you, Homer?

47:35.386 --> 47:38.921
- Not sure if you boys
have heard the bad news,

47:38.923 --> 47:40.990
but one of the waitresses
that worked here

47:40.992 --> 47:44.794
was found murdered
late last night.

47:46.364 --> 47:47.296
- Oh no.

47:47.298 --> 47:49.632
My goodness, who?

47:49.634 --> 47:51.400
- Oh, pretty little thing.

47:51.402 --> 47:54.070
Named Genevieve Du Bois.

47:54.072 --> 47:56.372
You boys know her.

47:59.844 --> 48:02.211
- We knew her somewhat, yes.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.882
She would wait on us
whenever we came in here.

48:07.218 --> 48:11.787
- Well, that's the reason
I'm bugging you folks.

48:11.789 --> 48:14.624
You see, I asked
Angelo, the owner here,

48:14.626 --> 48:16.826
to pick out for me a
few of the regulars,

48:16.828 --> 48:17.960
and he fingered you two,

48:17.962 --> 48:19.729
among a few others.

48:21.065 --> 48:24.700
- Well, we are certainly
regulars, aren't we Thomas?

48:24.702 --> 48:26.535
- Uh, yes.

48:26.537 --> 48:30.539
- And, you two are what friends?

48:30.541 --> 48:32.108
Lovers?

48:32.110 --> 48:34.176
Nothing unsavory
or illegal going on

48:34.178 --> 48:36.112
under this table is there?

48:37.148 --> 48:38.981
- No, Homer, we're brothers.

48:38.983 --> 48:42.485
I'm Charles Brubaker, and
this is Thomas Lo Bianco.

48:42.487 --> 48:44.353
- Different dads?

48:44.355 --> 48:45.588
- You got it.

48:45.590 --> 48:49.592
You must be really
good at what you do.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.460
- You flatter me.

48:53.765 --> 48:55.064
It's a gift.

48:55.066 --> 48:57.266
- Here you go, Detective.

48:57.268 --> 49:01.203
- Ah, Homer, please,
we're pals, remember?

49:01.205 --> 49:05.775
Now, lemme...

49:07.679 --> 49:10.279
Mmm!

49:10.281 --> 49:11.781
Oh!

49:11.783 --> 49:15.051
Oh, Angelo, Angelo,
Angelo, Angelo.

49:15.053 --> 49:16.986
This is the first
time I've actually

49:16.988 --> 49:20.323
tasted coffee the way
it was meant to be made.

49:23.594 --> 49:25.394
Mmm!

49:26.898 --> 49:29.198
Have you tried this coffee?

49:29.200 --> 49:30.499
Astounding!

49:30.501 --> 49:34.203
It's like cinnamon
and Jesus had a baby.

49:34.205 --> 49:37.306
- Don't trust him, Charles.

49:37.308 --> 49:38.841
Kill him.

49:38.843 --> 49:42.778
- You boys ever
chat with Genevieve?

49:42.780 --> 49:44.880
See her at all
outside this place?

49:44.882 --> 49:47.083
- I can't say we have.

49:47.085 --> 49:49.385
Wanted to though.

49:49.387 --> 49:51.754
She sure was a pretty
young little thing,

49:51.756 --> 49:54.190
like you said.

49:54.192 --> 49:55.391
- Yeah.

49:55.393 --> 49:57.293
Of course, I was
going off pictures.

49:57.295 --> 49:59.662
Whoever killed her...

49:59.664 --> 50:04.233
Man, those twisted bastards
really did a number on her.

50:05.470 --> 50:06.836
- How was she killed?

50:06.838 --> 50:07.970
- Charles!

50:11.876 --> 50:14.410
- It really wouldn't
help the investigation

50:14.412 --> 50:16.379
if I started running
my mouth about

50:16.381 --> 50:19.949
the sensitive details of
the case, now would it?

50:19.951 --> 50:21.717
Turn on the local news.

50:21.719 --> 50:25.821
I imagine all the gory details
will be in the 6 o'clock.

50:26.891 --> 50:31.761
Now, if I wanted to
reach you fellas again,

50:32.563 --> 50:34.764
how would I do that?

50:34.766 --> 50:38.701
- Well, this is our home number.

50:38.703 --> 50:41.904
And that's in gold
leaf too, FYI.

50:46.377 --> 50:49.712
- Pals, I wanna thank you.

50:49.714 --> 50:53.382
- Ah, ah, ah, Thomas,
manners, please.

50:53.384 --> 50:54.617
- Is it something I said?

50:54.619 --> 50:58.220
My aunt always told me
to modulate my tone.

50:58.222 --> 50:59.522
I hope I haven't been...

50:59.524 --> 51:01.323
- No, it's just that we're sick.

51:01.325 --> 51:02.992
Wouldn't want to spread it.

51:02.994 --> 51:06.362
Besides, you have
work to do, Homer.

51:06.364 --> 51:10.466
Taking a sick day now
would just slow you down.

51:10.468 --> 51:14.170
- That's really very
thoughtful of you.

51:17.508 --> 51:20.976
Talk soon, pals.

51:22.780 --> 51:24.880
Hey, can I talk to you folks.

51:24.882 --> 51:26.782
- Did you see his cup?

51:26.784 --> 51:28.317
He had the glow.

51:28.319 --> 51:30.686
- He came over to
shake our hands.

51:30.688 --> 51:33.255
- How can you be sure?

51:42.200 --> 51:44.133
- How 'bout a foreign film?

51:44.135 --> 51:45.935
Something long.

51:48.339 --> 51:50.306
- I'm not feeling well.

51:50.308 --> 51:52.174
Take me home.

51:52.176 --> 51:54.910
- Suit yourself, party pooper.

51:58.950 --> 52:01.383
- Oh, let's take a picture.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.726
- That one's good.

52:14.832 --> 52:16.899
- Shh!

52:33.151 --> 52:35.718
Excuse me, old timer.

53:55.099 --> 53:56.765
- My God, you pervs.

53:56.767 --> 53:57.533
Get out of here.

53:57.535 --> 53:58.767
Out, out, out.

53:58.769 --> 54:00.336
Hurry, move, move, move.

54:00.338 --> 54:01.337
Have I seen you before?

54:01.339 --> 54:02.805
Move, move, move.

54:23.794 --> 54:25.361
- Psychic cop.

54:27.365 --> 54:30.065
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

54:59.830 --> 55:01.530
- Mrs. Du Bois?

55:01.532 --> 55:03.932
- Oh, hello, Detective.

55:03.934 --> 55:05.267
- How we doin'?

55:05.269 --> 55:06.302
- Well, we're just...

55:06.304 --> 55:09.071
Trying to stay strong.

55:09.073 --> 55:10.873
For her.

55:12.343 --> 55:14.643
- Hey there, Maddie.

55:14.645 --> 55:19.014
- Honey, this is the man
that I was telling you about.

55:19.016 --> 55:20.649
- Can I shake your hand?

55:23.788 --> 55:25.120
- Well, if you guys
need a fill up,

55:25.122 --> 55:27.156
just let me know.

55:37.568 --> 55:40.703
- Thank you for that, Sweetie.

55:40.705 --> 55:43.405
Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.

55:44.608 --> 55:47.976
- You know, you're
kind of her hero.

55:47.978 --> 55:50.446
- She's kind of mine.

55:51.215 --> 55:53.882
I promise on my life

55:53.884 --> 55:55.751
that I will find the bad people

55:55.753 --> 55:58.987
who did this to your
wonderful beautiful mommy.

56:00.091 --> 56:02.257
It's my job,

56:02.259 --> 56:06.395
to make sure little
girls don't cry.

56:06.397 --> 56:08.030
You can count on me.

56:08.032 --> 56:09.932
Okay?

56:13.137 --> 56:15.804
I'm the axe,

56:15.806 --> 56:19.007
and they're the big bad wolves.

56:28.319 --> 56:29.985
- Who is that?

56:30.788 --> 56:32.688
Who the fuck is that?

56:57.081 --> 57:00.382
- Here we go.

57:00.384 --> 57:01.617
Ham and cheese.

57:01.619 --> 57:04.119
- Mmm, extra mayo?

57:04.121 --> 57:07.990
- Extra extra mayo, my dear.

57:07.992 --> 57:10.259
Now, I have to dash,

57:10.261 --> 57:11.794
but Thomas will be here if...

57:11.796 --> 57:12.895
- No.

57:12.897 --> 57:15.197
I'm turning in early tonight.

57:15.199 --> 57:16.565
Hopefully.

57:16.567 --> 57:18.567
- Oh, okay.

57:18.569 --> 57:20.335
- Down the hatch.

57:20.337 --> 57:23.238
- Over the lips and
through the gums.

57:24.708 --> 57:27.409
- Sleep well.

57:27.411 --> 57:29.044
- Be a good boy.

57:29.046 --> 57:32.781
- I'll be the very best, mother.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.755
- What are you gonna do tonight?

57:39.757 --> 57:41.790
- Just drive.

57:41.792 --> 57:43.058
We'll see what develops.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.293
- You're not going to...

57:44.295 --> 57:47.763
- If the spirit moves
me, I shall allow it to.

57:47.765 --> 57:50.265
- You remember that
cop from this morning?

57:50.267 --> 57:51.400
- Who, Homer?

57:51.402 --> 57:53.235
- He's supposed to be psychic.

57:54.672 --> 57:56.371
- I knew it!

57:56.373 --> 57:59.808
Something told me to keep
you away from his hand.

57:59.810 --> 58:02.277
That's why his
drink had the glow.

58:02.279 --> 58:05.848
- He's got a 98%
conviction record, Charles.

58:06.750 --> 58:08.917
- Well.

58:09.954 --> 58:11.787
All we can do is hope.

58:11.789 --> 58:13.489
- What?

58:15.726 --> 58:19.795
- That we fall within
that golden 2%.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.799
- He knows.

58:23.801 --> 58:25.501
I'm sure he knows.

58:25.503 --> 58:29.171
- Thomas, psychic
intuition is not evidence.

58:29.173 --> 58:33.942
Even if he's really
really good at it.

58:33.944 --> 58:35.944
He may know,

58:35.946 --> 58:39.548
but he still has to prove it.

58:39.550 --> 58:41.517
We are above this,

58:41.519 --> 58:43.719
and we always have been.

59:02.006 --> 59:05.541
Do you know where the keys are.

59:05.543 --> 59:07.242
- Um, no.

59:08.212 --> 59:10.512
How should I know?

59:11.515 --> 59:16.418
- Thomas, are you lying to me?

59:18.822 --> 59:20.556
- What do you say we
just stay home tonight,

59:20.558 --> 59:21.490
get drunk,

59:21.492 --> 59:22.724
and watch some reality TV crap?

59:22.726 --> 59:26.628
- Oh, but that's boring, Thomas.

59:26.630 --> 59:28.697
And if there's
one things I hate,

59:28.699 --> 59:30.766
it's boredom.

59:32.202 --> 59:33.835
Now-

59:35.372 --> 59:37.039
That bulge in your right pocket

59:37.041 --> 59:40.842
wouldn't happen to be
the keys, would it?

59:44.882 --> 59:46.481
Thank you.

59:48.152 --> 59:51.920
What would I do without
you, big brother?

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:16.244
Well, hello gorgeous.

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:18.146
- Well, well.

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:20.782
Where's Tweedledum?

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.451
- He's at home.

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:25.621
He's a little shy.

01:00:25.623 --> 01:00:28.023
Doesn't know how
to treat a lady.

01:00:28.993 --> 01:00:30.826
- But you do?

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:32.928
- Only one way to find out.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.743
- Same room, huh?

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:24.279
Maybe you should
rent it by the month.

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:27.749
- It's not going to be
very clean after tonight.

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:33.121
- Things gonna get
dirty, are they?

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:35.624
- You could say that.

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:36.858
- Yeah?

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.428
You look like a
nasty little boy.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.731
- I have no intention
of kissing you

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:45.734
or the 1000 cocks you've sucked.

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:47.436
- Well, fuck.

01:01:47.438 --> 01:01:49.571
Tell me how you
really feel about me.

01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:51.073
I'm gonna go freshen up.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.241
- Take a shower.

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:57.913
With soap and hot water.

01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:00.515
I want you to be clean.

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:04.219
Put this on.

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.357
You see,

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:14.529
I'm going to eat you,

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:17.365
from head to toe.

01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:23.672
- Sounds like a
Saturday night to me.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:41.423
- Okay, you no-faced bitch.

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:43.425
Come and get me.

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:50.465
Come out,

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:51.433
Come out,

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.735
Wherever you are.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.527
Oh shit!

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.533
Oh fuck!

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:54.896
Oh Jesus.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:55.730
No, no, no, no.

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:56.631
No, no, no, Genevieve.

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:57.499
Please.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:58.800
I'm sorry.

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:00.268
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.803
I'm so sorry.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:04.840
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:06.541
Please, please, please.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:07.809
I'm sorry.

01:04:07.811 --> 01:04:08.777
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:09.578
No, no.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.979
Please, please, please.

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:12.280
No, fuck.

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:12.948
Sorry.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:13.748
I'm sorry.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:14.416
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:15.418
No, no, no.

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:34.769
- Thomas!

01:04:36.807 --> 01:04:39.708
- You see, my brother
and I have a theory.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:43.812
We once saw a cat get run
over by a car when we were 6.

01:04:45.182 --> 01:04:47.082
A week later the carcass
hadn't been picked up yet,

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:49.851
but where it laid in the grass,

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:53.321
a patch of daisies
just sprung up.

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:57.559
That's where we first saw it.

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:00.795
- Saw what?

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:03.999
- The divine tragedies of life.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.904
God's love in death.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:13.909
Beauty amongst ugliness and rot.

01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:18.680
- Are you a bible
thumper or something?

01:05:18.682 --> 01:05:20.348
- No.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:23.051
No, we haven't
written our bible.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:26.521
Not yet.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:28.990
But you.

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:33.261
You're very lucky.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.397
- Oh yeah?

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:37.899
Why's that?

01:05:37.901 --> 01:05:41.636
- You will be our second
step toward divinity.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:43.972
You see, when I said that I was

01:05:43.974 --> 01:05:47.108
going to eat you
from head to toe,

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:51.680
I meant that I was
going to eat all of you.

01:05:51.682 --> 01:05:53.348
Your skin.

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:56.551
Your heart.

01:05:56.553 --> 01:05:58.653
Your liver.

01:05:58.655 --> 01:05:59.854
Your pancreas.

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:01.556
Your spleen.

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:02.991
Your ovaries.

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:04.526
Your everything.

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:05.593
- What the fuck do you...

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:24.746
- This is one of my favorites.

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:34.289
I can kill you
first if you like,

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:38.326
but you have to promise
to be quiet, my dear.

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:42.998
Vanity, come on.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.132
- Fuck you.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:56.644
- What did you do, you bitch?

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:58.380
You fucking bitch.

01:06:58.382 --> 01:06:59.581
What the fuck?

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.164
- What the hell?

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:23.705
Oh Jesus.

01:07:32.616 --> 01:07:34.916
What the hell?

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:40.855
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.795
What the fuck?

01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:56.071
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:29.804
- Oh my God.

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:49.858
- So how long does something
like this usually take?

01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:55.796
- Depends on how
willing the spirit is.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.434
Sometimes a day or two,

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.470
sometimes instantly.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:09.144
- And, what do you see?

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.113
Is it like pictures, or what?

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:14.015
- Anything.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.618
Sometimes the last images,

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:21.156
sometimes bits and
pieces, voices,

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:26.194
and it completely takes me in.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:30.365
I see all of it.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.304
- And with her?

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.805
- With her...

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.319
I'm with you now.

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.924
I'm here.

01:09:57.727 --> 01:09:59.727
Talk to me.

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.630
Talk to me.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:05.833
Did you know them.

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.636
Good.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:12.540
That's good, sweetheart.

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:16.177
You have to tell me
their names, Genevieve.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.783
Don't worry.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:24.886
They can't hurt you anymore.

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:29.891
Talk to me, so I can make sure
they don't get away with it.

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:33.962
- They'll hurt Maddie.

01:10:33.964 --> 01:10:36.364
- She's safe.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:40.335
I sent her away
with your mother.

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:43.304
I won't let anything
happen to her.

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:46.774
I promise.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:50.878
Now, talk to me, please.

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:06.828
She's being stubborn
because she's scared.

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:12.100
But I know there
were two of them.

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:17.005
One did all the killing
and the other watched.

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:38.926
- Almost.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:46.501
Yes, that's it.

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:02.984
- Hi, how's it goin'?

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.752
- Shut up, bro.

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:32.347
- Hey, hey, I caught you.

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:41.222
I tried the door,
no one answered.

01:12:41.224 --> 01:12:43.858
Figured you were out,
figured I would wait.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.161
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, my
boy, what happened to you?

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:50.598
- I fell down the
stairs, Detective.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.134
- It's Homer,
we're pals, please.

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:54.669
Does it hurt much.

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:55.770
My wife always says onion...

01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:58.106
- How can I help you, Homer?

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:02.543
- Well, I wanted to ask
a few followup questions

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:05.146
if you have a spare
second or three.

01:13:07.584 --> 01:13:11.386
- Alright, okay,
yeah, okay, sure.

01:13:11.388 --> 01:13:15.723
Is this about the
whole waitress thing?

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.425
- Yeah, pal.

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:20.528
I'm afraid it's about
the whole waitress thing.

01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:23.231
- Alright.

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:29.470
Here's your water.

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:31.639
- Oh, thank you.

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:33.107
- Yeah.

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:35.009
- So, where's your brother?

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:38.312
- He's around somewhere.

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:48.022
I don't really keep tabs on him.

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.690
- That's curious.

01:13:49.692 --> 01:13:53.194
I figured you two
for being very close.

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:56.731
- Well, we are.

01:13:58.067 --> 01:13:59.967
Sort of.

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:01.702
- Sort of?

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:04.272
Well now.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:08.543
Probably off with
his girlfriend.

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:10.678
- Charles doesn't
have a girlfriend.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.480
- He doesn't?

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:15.283
Well, no dancing
car for him then.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:19.587
You're the lady killer
in the family, huh?

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:21.589
- I don't know about that.

01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:23.591
I'd say Charles has
more to account for

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:25.827
in that department.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:31.666
- So, both your dad and
Charles' dad are dead?

01:14:31.668 --> 01:14:33.034
- Yes, sir.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:34.302
- Heart attack for one,

01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:37.004
drunk driving for
the other, tragic.

01:14:38.842 --> 01:14:40.174
- It happens.

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:41.976
- It does.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:44.745
Doesn't make it any less tragic.

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:46.380
Right?

01:14:47.283 --> 01:14:48.549
- Right.

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:50.017
Yeah.

01:14:56.759 --> 01:14:59.794
- Nice place.

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:02.296
Good use of space.

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:03.531
- Thank you.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:05.633
- What do you call this
style of architecture?

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:08.536
- Oh, I don't really know.

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:10.972
I guess it would be a...

01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:13.040
I don't know.

01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:30.791
- So, where were you the night

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:34.161
Genevieve Du Bois died, Thomas?

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:40.334
- Um.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:41.736
What night was that again?

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:43.437
- Two nights ago.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:48.809
- Oh, gee, let me think.

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:57.084
No, I can't remember.

01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:59.053
- You know who I am.

01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:02.056
- I looked you up.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.991
- I figured you would.

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:07.261
So you know what
I can do, right?

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:12.166
You're not stupid, Mr. 160 IQ.

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.835
Best to be honest
with me, alright?

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:21.909
- I know about the...

01:16:26.649 --> 01:16:28.616
Charles took it, not me.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:32.853
- I've got you, pal.

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:37.792
Let's make it easy.

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:45.199
Shit!

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:47.902
I should've seen that coming.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:51.772
- Mother?

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:54.909
- He talked too much.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:59.113
- Mother, are you okay?

01:16:59.115 --> 01:16:59.780
Come on.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:01.248
You're okay.

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:03.250
Here's the bed.

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:04.418
Hop up.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.020
Okay.
Okay.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.057
Here you are.

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:11.892
Can I get you anything.

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:14.061
- I'm fine.

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:16.697
- If there's anything,
I'd be happy to.

01:17:16.699 --> 01:17:18.666
- No, I'm fine.

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:21.002
- I just, I feel like I should
probably explain a few...

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:24.171
- Just send Charles
in when he arrives.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.550
- Why do you hate me?

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:40.721
With every word you say to me,

01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:42.456
you spit poison.

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:45.159
You hate my fucking guts.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.628
- Thomas, language!

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:50.631
- I try to be the
good son for you,

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:53.034
but you always want Charles.

01:17:53.036 --> 01:17:54.702
Why is that?

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:01.375
- Alright.

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:05.513
Alright.

01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:09.050
Could you get mumsie some
of her medicine, please?

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:12.853
- Of course, mother.

01:18:17.427 --> 01:18:19.026
Mother...

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:21.729
Can I...

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:28.135
Can we talk about
what just happened?

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:31.572
- Best to forget it, I think.

01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:34.608
- There's a police
officer bleeding to death

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:35.743
in our living room,

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:38.412
we can't just forget it.

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:43.951
The thing is, mother,

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:50.057
Charles and I,

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:55.162
We...

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:56.931
Killed someone.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:01.135
- I know.

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:02.703
- You what?

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:06.340
- It's called guilt,
you big pussy.

01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:08.442
That's what you're feeling.

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:11.178
And you wonder why
I favor Charles.

01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:14.515
- He told you.

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:17.485
Charles, he told you?

01:19:17.487 --> 01:19:19.520
- Of course he told me.

01:19:19.522 --> 01:19:21.922
He told me the
night it happened.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:23.324
Especially how
you started acting

01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:26.026
like a colicky
little baby about it.

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.464
You're just like
your mewling father.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.333
Useless.

01:19:33.503 --> 01:19:36.103
If I hadn't killed
him when I did,

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.572
he would've impregnated

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:41.408
that stupid secretary
of his for sure,

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:44.011
spreading more of his
garbage seed around.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:45.579
- What are you saying, mother?

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:48.182
- Your father was a drunk.

01:19:49.585 --> 01:19:51.619
It was easy to fake.

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:55.756
And Charles' father
was a genius, but...

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:59.527
He couldn't fuck
to save his life.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:01.629
- Oh my God.

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:03.564
- Do you know how easy it is

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:07.334
to fake a heart attack, Thomas?

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:09.503
You could even pull it off.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.440
- Mother?

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:14.341
Why?

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:16.110
- Because.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:19.880
They weren't worthy, that's why.

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:28.489
I know the two of you

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:32.526
have been paying attention
to me over the years.

01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:34.829
But somehow,

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:38.766
somehow I knew I'd
go wrong with you.

01:20:38.768 --> 01:20:41.001
You had garbage genetics.

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:43.771
You've been my canker
sore ever since.

01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:47.875
- Jesus Christ.

01:20:47.877 --> 01:20:50.377
- Oh, look at you.

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:53.647
Acting like one
of them even now.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:57.918
You may have come
out of my cunt,

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.487
but you came out wrong.

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:07.795
- You killed my father?

01:21:09.832 --> 01:21:11.799
- And I was happy to do it.

01:21:11.801 --> 01:21:14.668
- But he loved me.

01:21:15.838 --> 01:21:17.671
- Love isn't real.

01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:22.176
Respect and fear, that's it.

01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:25.446
Charles respects me
because he fears me.

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:28.582
But you...

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:30.951
You're different.

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:33.187
You're weak and powerless

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:36.790
and you yearn for
things that don't exist.

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:40.494
You may have acted
like Mr. Big and Bad,

01:21:40.496 --> 01:21:42.329
but when the world opened up and

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:44.164
showed itself to you,

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:46.734
you shit your pants or ran
away like a little baby.

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:52.606
You should just kill
yourself and be done with it.

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:54.775
Save us the trouble of
having to deal with you.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.819
Oh good.

01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:07.554
Shoot yourself in the head.

01:22:07.556 --> 01:22:09.556
Pull a Hemingway.

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:12.159
Smartest thing
you could ever do.

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:17.831
I've been pushing Charles
for years to kill you,

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:20.000
but he wouldn't do it.

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:22.169
Damn idiot.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.908
I should've aborted you
when I had the chance.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:31.745
Really, Thomas?

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:37.017
You don't have the balls.

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:46.894
- You can't run away from
what you did, mother.

01:22:59.909 --> 01:23:01.475
- Hey, fat guy.

01:23:05.982 --> 01:23:07.815
Hold this.

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:14.054
Thank you.

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:48.949
You like me.

01:24:49.785 --> 01:24:52.820
You really like me.

01:24:56.959 --> 01:24:59.827
I want to thank my mother,

01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:01.895
and Thomas,

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:05.199
and most of all,

01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:07.601
I want to thank God.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:08.902
Thank you.

01:25:08.904 --> 01:25:10.737
Thank you.

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:19.813
Goodnight!

01:25:30.759 --> 01:25:32.926
- Where were you?

01:25:36.031 --> 01:25:38.599
- Where was I?

01:25:41.437 --> 01:25:43.137
Oh, yeah.

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:48.876
I was turning water into wine.

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:56.783
- You're really the king of
the fucking idiots, aren't you?

01:25:58.087 --> 01:26:01.355
- It's nice to see you too.

01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:06.360
- You framed it?

01:26:06.362 --> 01:26:07.594
- Yeah.

01:26:07.596 --> 01:26:10.130
I had to go to three
separate craft stores

01:26:10.132 --> 01:26:12.733
just to find the right size too.

01:26:12.735 --> 01:26:15.202
- And you told mother.

01:26:15.204 --> 01:26:17.871
What the hell were you thinking?

01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:24.511
- What did you do?

01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:28.815
Mother?

01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:31.285
Mother?

01:26:32.488 --> 01:26:33.820
Mother?

01:26:40.095 --> 01:26:41.328
Mommy?

01:26:43.732 --> 01:26:45.165
Mommy?

01:26:46.602 --> 01:26:47.501
Mommy?

01:26:47.503 --> 01:26:48.735
No.

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:50.837
No, no, no, no.

01:26:52.775 --> 01:26:54.775
What did you do?

01:27:07.823 --> 01:27:11.692
You didn't have to kill her.

01:27:11.694 --> 01:27:15.195
- Don't you see
what she did to us?

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:18.398
We're like this because of her.

01:27:20.169 --> 01:27:21.535
- Like what?

01:27:21.537 --> 01:27:22.603
- Delusional.

01:27:22.605 --> 01:27:24.037
Crazy.

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:34.881
- I'm

01:27:37.119 --> 01:27:38.719
crazy.

01:27:41.156 --> 01:27:43.690
She wasn't crazy.

01:27:43.692 --> 01:27:46.260
You're crazy!

01:27:46.262 --> 01:27:48.762
You're crazy!

01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:51.932
You're the crazy one!

01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:01.141
- What happened to us?

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:03.710
What the hell happened to us?

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.946
- Everything!

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:09.316
Everything happened
to us, Thomas!

01:28:09.318 --> 01:28:12.185
We were made for this!

01:28:12.187 --> 01:28:14.488
Because we're smarter.

01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:16.990
We're better.

01:28:16.992 --> 01:28:20.994
All this other garbage
and conventional thinking,

01:28:22.264 --> 01:28:24.331
we're beyond that.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:26.967
We have the look.

01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:27.901
- What look?

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:29.936
- I have the look!

01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:33.006
Jeffrey Dahmer had it.

01:28:33.008 --> 01:28:34.875
Ted Bundy had it.

01:28:34.877 --> 01:28:38.045
And now, I do too.

01:28:38.047 --> 01:28:42.482
The look of a confident
and untouchable being.

01:28:43.552 --> 01:28:46.653
We've touched hands
with the divine, Thomas.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:48.789
Our eyes

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:52.225
have been opened

01:28:52.227 --> 01:28:54.094
by God.

01:28:54.096 --> 01:28:55.796
- We were wrong.

01:28:57.566 --> 01:29:00.500
We were so fucking wrong.

01:29:03.906 --> 01:29:06.940
- There is no regret.

01:29:09.645 --> 01:29:11.378
Not for us.

01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:15.615
Not anymore.

01:29:15.617 --> 01:29:18.218
Once you're born,

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:20.954
you can't go back.

01:29:20.956 --> 01:29:22.489
- Stop talking, you're crazy.

01:29:22.491 --> 01:29:24.491
You don't get to talk.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:32.766
- Where are you going?

01:29:37.272 --> 01:29:38.672
- Get off, Charles.

01:29:49.752 --> 01:29:53.553
- You're telling on us?

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:54.788
Huh?

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:56.623
You're gonna tell
on us like a little

01:29:56.625 --> 01:29:59.860
snot-nosed tattle tale?

01:29:59.862 --> 01:30:00.660
Huh?

01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:05.065
You big mongoloid baby.

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:09.703
I swear to God, I could just
kill you right now, Thomas.

01:30:13.308 --> 01:30:14.775
Thomas!

01:30:24.653 --> 01:30:27.821
- Let's turn ourselves in.

01:30:29.258 --> 01:30:31.458
- Stop this, Thomas.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:33.927
We can bury mother and go back

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:35.962
to the way things were.

01:30:36.799 --> 01:30:39.332
Nothing has to change.

01:30:39.334 --> 01:30:42.068
- We can't run away
from what we did.

01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:49.543
They're waiting for our call.

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:51.077
- Don't.

01:30:51.079 --> 01:30:53.280
- We can ask for
a cell together.

01:30:53.282 --> 01:30:54.614
They should be
able to grant that

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:56.249
if we cooperate.

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:01.421
- Don't call them, Thomas.

01:31:01.423 --> 01:31:03.323
- It'll be okay, baby brother.

01:31:05.761 --> 01:31:08.895
- Thomas, put the phone down.

01:31:08.897 --> 01:31:12.032
- They said they'd go easy
on us if we confessed.

01:31:12.034 --> 01:31:14.901
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:31:16.071 --> 01:31:20.407
- Thomas, put down
the fucking phone.

01:31:20.409 --> 01:31:22.142
- Language, Charles.

01:31:31.487 --> 01:31:33.887
- Tommy?

01:31:33.889 --> 01:31:35.489
Oh shit.

01:31:35.491 --> 01:31:37.023
Oh shit.

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:39.493
Thomas?

01:31:43.265 --> 01:31:45.499
Oh my God.

01:31:45.501 --> 01:31:46.700
Tommy?

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.807
Are you okay?

01:31:56.378 --> 01:32:00.914
- I could use some
sunshine right about now.

01:32:02.985 --> 01:32:04.718
- Okay.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:07.087
Okay.

01:32:10.759 --> 01:32:15.262
♪ Sunshine, baby ♪

01:32:15.264 --> 01:32:18.298
♪ It's sunshine ♪

01:32:20.269 --> 01:32:24.304
♪ Time to wake up, baby ♪

01:32:24.306 --> 01:32:28.909
