00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:05.500 --> 00:08.040
Hey, you wanted to speak
with us, Agent Johnson?

00:08.040 --> 00:11.670
KC, I'm sending you
to Switzerland tomorrow

00:11.670 --> 00:15.500
to attend the International
Conference of Young
Espionage Agents.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.460
No way.
What an honor.

00:17.460 --> 00:19.620
That's...

00:19.620 --> 00:22.250
Only the best of the best agents
get to go to that conference.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.830
- Thank you.
- You've earned it, KC.

00:23.830 --> 00:25.960
So what time should
we be at the airport?

00:25.960 --> 00:27.420
Oh...

00:27.420 --> 00:31.330
Okay, what time should I drop
KC off at the airport?

00:31.330 --> 00:33.040
Don't be ridiculous, Ernie.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.460
- So I am going?
- No.

00:35.460 --> 00:38.330
I meant we have
a car service for KC,

00:38.330 --> 00:41.120
but I figured,
why rub your nose in it?

00:41.120 --> 00:43.540
Ooh, is it one of
those fancy stretch limos?

00:43.540 --> 00:45.040
Of course not, KC.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.710
We're on a budget.

00:48.170 --> 00:50.330
Enough is enough!

00:50.330 --> 00:51.880
I should be going.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.460
I'm tired of
being overlooked.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.080
I'm just as good
as KC.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.710
When's it gonna
be my time?

00:56.710 --> 00:58.380
If you're referring to
shower time,

00:58.380 --> 01:00.460
that would've been this morning,
and every morning.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.380
Relax, Ernie.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.460
You'll be hosting

01:05.460 --> 01:07.250
a group of young
international agents,

01:07.250 --> 01:10.380
training them in
our latest computer
innovations and gadgets.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.170
So just to clarify,

01:12.170 --> 01:14.120
I'm in charge of
training this team?

01:14.120 --> 01:16.120
- Yes.
- And not to nitpick,

01:16.120 --> 01:18.830
but my team will be made up
of actual real people,

01:18.830 --> 01:21.120
not like the time I was
in charge of cleaning up

01:21.120 --> 01:23.380
- after that dog sled team?
- Yes.

01:23.380 --> 01:28.000
And how many of these agents
will be single ladies?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.790
Ernie, don't make me
take this away from you.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.460
Welcome, everybody.

02:29.460 --> 02:31.000
I'm Agent Ernie Cooper,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.420
and I'm honored
to be your team leader.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.460
I could not be more thrilled
to further your training

02:36.460 --> 02:38.830
in the art of espionage.

02:40.670 --> 02:42.460
Now, it is a tradition
in my country

02:42.460 --> 02:45.670
to open with a joke,
so here we go.

02:45.670 --> 02:48.670
Why are there no knock-knock
jokes about America?

02:50.580 --> 02:53.880
Because freedom rings.

02:58.580 --> 03:00.380
Okay, not hilarious,
but come on.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.250
You can at least
crack a smile for me.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.880
Don't worry, it's not
your barely mediocre
sense of humor, Ernie.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.670
They just don't
speak your language.

03:07.670 --> 03:10.040
C'est agréable d'être ici,
mais je ne comprends
pas ce que vous dites.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.290
Baegopa. Meog-eul geiss-eo?

03:12.290 --> 03:14.960
Hola. Me llama Lecia
de Mexico.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.250
El vuelo aquí tenia
con baches,

03:17.250 --> 03:21.420
así que no nos dejaron
levantarnos por siete horas.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.670
This is probably a good time

03:24.670 --> 03:26.500
to mention that I don't
speak Spanish,

03:26.500 --> 03:28.040
or any other language.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.080
Howard, can we
get some kids

03:30.080 --> 03:33.580
from Australia,
England, and Canada?

03:33.580 --> 03:35.540
Don't worry. Once my TUNG
is in your ear,

03:35.540 --> 03:37.250
we'll all understand
each other.

03:37.250 --> 03:41.540
Understand this, Howard.
That ain't gonna happen.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.120
No, I'm talking about

03:43.120 --> 03:45.330
my Translation
Understanding Neuro Gadget.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.710
AKA the TUNG.

03:47.710 --> 03:49.670
Well, in that case, what are
you waiting for, Howard?

03:49.670 --> 03:50.710
TUNG me.

03:55.250 --> 03:58.710
( devices beeping )

03:58.710 --> 04:01.880
Hello, Ernie. It is a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.170
It's so great to be in
your nation's capital.

04:05.170 --> 04:06.790
That's better.

04:06.790 --> 04:08.750
Now what were you trying
to say in Spanish before?

04:08.750 --> 04:11.540
Show me where your bathroom is
before you have to show me

04:11.540 --> 04:13.210
where your mop is.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.620
Well, I'd say we're off to
a pretty good start.

04:21.710 --> 04:25.750
Once the IP address
is re-set, you're golden.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.670
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,

04:27.670 --> 04:30.670
is how you penetrate
a firewall

04:30.670 --> 04:32.580
without getting burned.

04:36.330 --> 04:39.790
Did you not understand
Ernie's wordplay,

04:39.790 --> 04:41.790
or is your translator broken?

04:41.790 --> 04:44.170
My translator's fine.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.620
It's the joke that's broken.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.170
Or your sense of humor.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.960
Anyhoo...

04:50.960 --> 04:52.750
Howard's now gonna
demonstrate

04:52.750 --> 04:54.710
some of our new
field gear.

04:56.670 --> 04:59.790
Now, you may think that

04:59.790 --> 05:01.670
this is a normal
set of pens,

05:01.670 --> 05:05.420
but you'd be makin'
a dilly of a whoopsie.

05:05.420 --> 05:06.620
Dagger.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.620
Laser.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.580
Finally, climbing spikes.

05:16.830 --> 05:19.290
Okay, who wants to climb?

05:19.290 --> 05:20.880
Uh...

05:20.880 --> 05:22.880
Go ahead, Amelie.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.710
No, thanks. I'm good.
Lecia, go for it.

05:26.710 --> 05:29.460
That's okay.
I'll just sit here.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.880
Seriously? No one
wants to try?

05:31.880 --> 05:33.790
Even I could do this.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.620
Come on, guys.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.750
This stuff could come in handy
on your next field mission.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.380
Oh, I don't go on
field missions.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.000
I never leave the van.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.710
Really?
What about you, Amelie?

05:44.710 --> 05:47.420
I also never
leave the van.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.210
- I don't stay in the van.
- Great.

05:49.210 --> 05:51.790
I stay on a bike.

05:51.790 --> 05:54.250
You mean a bike like,
vroom, vroom?

05:54.250 --> 05:56.460
No. A bike.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.710
Like, ding-a-ling.

05:58.710 --> 06:01.620
Vans are scary.

06:01.620 --> 06:05.750
You mean you guys
are all van people?

06:05.750 --> 06:08.710
Not me,
as I mentioned.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.880
Ding-a-ling.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.120
Yeah, I get it.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.620
- I'm in charge of
Team Ding-A-Ling.
- ( device rings )

06:20.710 --> 06:22.710
Hey, what's up, bro?

06:22.710 --> 06:25.040
This conference is so dope.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.830
I'm with the coolest agents.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.830
We literally just jumped
out of a plane with skis on,

06:28.830 --> 06:30.830
landed on a mountain,
skied down the mountain,

06:30.830 --> 06:33.830
to a cabin,
and saved eight hostages.

06:33.830 --> 06:37.250
Yes, but where was
the van?

06:37.250 --> 06:38.830
Uh, who's that?

06:38.830 --> 06:41.080
We saved nine hostages,
and that was one of them.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.710
Things are just as awesome
here as they are there.

06:43.710 --> 06:46.540
If you don't think so,
you'd be makin' a dilly of
a whoopsie. Gotta go! Bye.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.750
Can you believe KC's in
James Bond fantasy camp,

06:51.750 --> 06:53.920
and we're with
the van people?

06:53.920 --> 06:56.710
I know, right?

06:56.710 --> 06:59.250
We're with
the van people!

06:59.250 --> 07:01.500
Van, van.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.500
ALL: Van, van, van, van,
van, van, van, van!

07:05.500 --> 07:07.790
( chanting continues )

07:09.830 --> 07:12.500
Morning, agents.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.960
I have brought you all
a traditional American meal.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.670
Breakfast burritos.
They're scrum-diddly-umcious.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.960
You know, Ernie,
in my country,

07:24.960 --> 07:27.580
if you're wearing pajamas
past 10:00 a.m.,

07:27.580 --> 07:29.750
it means you died
in your sleep.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.290
What's wrong, Ernie?

07:33.290 --> 07:35.920
Look. I am a walrus.

07:38.210 --> 07:41.380
It is true. The pencils
resemble tusks,

07:41.380 --> 07:42.830
making you look like
a walrus.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.380
Lecia, look at Jin.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.000
Where is Jin?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.790
I only see a walrus.

07:47.790 --> 07:50.210
- I love America!
- ( making walrus noises )

07:50.210 --> 07:52.790
That's what's wrong.

07:52.790 --> 07:54.710
That's my team.

07:54.710 --> 07:57.170
I'm so disappointed.

07:57.170 --> 08:00.120
I thought this was gonna
be my big shot to prove myself.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.620
The only thing it proves
is how little faith

08:02.620 --> 08:04.210
the Organization
has in me.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.250
Good morning, agents.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.580
I have a very important
mission for you.

08:08.580 --> 08:11.000
You do? I mean,
of course you do.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.080
Why wouldn't you?
You have total faith in me.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.380
- But you just--
- Eat your breakfast.

08:17.620 --> 08:20.290
You were saying something
about an important mission, sir?

08:20.290 --> 08:23.000
We've received intel
that the website Buzziebuzz

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
is using clickbait quizzes
to build psychological profiles

08:27.000 --> 08:28.290
on the youth population.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.960
So what do you
need us to do?

08:29.960 --> 08:32.500
You're gonna sit in the van,
and observe and report.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.710
And then?

08:33.710 --> 08:35.210
Observe and report some more.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.080
- And then?
- Observe and report!

08:37.080 --> 08:39.330
Johnson out.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.120
Okay, okay.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.250
Okay, team.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.040
It may sound like he just
wants us to observe and report,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.380
but still,
a game changer.

08:48.380 --> 08:50.580
A chance to prove ourselves.

08:50.580 --> 08:51.880
We have a mission.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.580
Everyone, to the van!

08:53.580 --> 08:55.170
Van, van, van, van...

08:55.170 --> 08:57.830
Bike, bike, bike, bike...

08:57.830 --> 08:59.710
All right, fine.

08:59.710 --> 09:04.380
Van, van, van, van,
van, van, van, van!

09:04.380 --> 09:07.540
( chanting continues )

09:09.880 --> 09:12.750
Now, the key to
observing and reporting

09:12.750 --> 09:15.920
is you don't report
until you've observed.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.330
Jin, what's
in your hand?

09:18.330 --> 09:19.830
Nothing.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.710
What's in your hand?

09:22.710 --> 09:24.080
Nothing!

09:24.080 --> 09:25.380
Show me your hand, walrus.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.460
Come on, pay
attention, people.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.500
Let's review.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.040
Lecia, if you see
your mark leaving,
what do you do?

09:37.040 --> 09:40.580
If your mark is leaving,
the first thing is don't panic.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.330
The second thing is...
para informar a su supervisor

09:43.330 --> 09:47.420
y pregunte si debe cola
a una distancia segura

09:47.420 --> 09:50.290
o permanece donde estás.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.710
Howard, I think there's
something wrong with
your TUNG device.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.620
Trust me, it's fine.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.880
Il fait très chaud ici.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.000
Est-il possible que nous
puissions ouvrir une fenêtre?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.460
Okay, maybe
it's on the fritz.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.540
Great.

10:03.540 --> 10:07.080
How am I supposed to lead
this rag-tag team to greatness

10:07.080 --> 10:10.120
if I can't understand
anything anyone's saying?

10:10.120 --> 10:11.960
Howard, fix it.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.330
Listen.

10:14.330 --> 10:16.920
There is a nice way
to ask me to do that,

10:16.920 --> 10:19.460
and then, there's
the way you just did.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.120
Or, let me put it
in a way you'll understand.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.710
I just observed you
acting like a butt.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.330
And now I will
report it to you.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.920
Ernie, you're a butt!

10:30.920 --> 10:32.880
You take that back.
Take that back right now!

10:32.880 --> 10:35.250
( all yelling at once )

10:35.250 --> 10:38.330
Quiet! Silencio! Sh!

10:38.330 --> 10:40.420
Where's Lecia?

10:40.420 --> 10:42.670
I don't know.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.920
Lecia est dans
les bureaux Buzziebuzz.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.330
I don't speak French.

10:46.330 --> 10:49.290
Lecia est dans
les bureaux Buzziebuzz!

10:51.420 --> 10:53.170
ERNIE: What is she doing
in Buzziebuzz?

10:53.170 --> 10:55.330
If they spot her
in there, she'll
blow our cover.

10:55.330 --> 10:57.420
Are you sure
they can't understand us?

10:57.420 --> 10:58.540
- Yes.
- Good.

10:58.540 --> 11:00.040
You knuckleheads
stay here.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.210
Howard, let's go.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.540
Ernie, psst.
Look over there.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.540
Is it Lecia?

11:17.540 --> 11:19.750
No. They have a rug
made out of fake grass.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.080
What are they gonna
think of next?

11:22.080 --> 11:23.960
Who cares
about the rug?

11:23.960 --> 11:25.330
We have to find
Lecia.

11:25.330 --> 11:27.750
There she is.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.330
Lecia.

11:29.330 --> 11:32.790
Son muy tacaños
con el mango aquí.

11:34.420 --> 11:36.540
Lecia, what
are you doing?

11:36.540 --> 11:38.380
This is not
observing and reporting.

11:38.380 --> 11:40.330
This is drinking juice
and trespassing.

11:40.330 --> 11:41.420
You could blow
our cover.

11:43.290 --> 11:44.380
Forget it.
Let's go.

11:50.620 --> 11:53.210
Brady!

12:01.790 --> 12:03.170
Ernie, we should get
back to the van,

12:03.170 --> 12:04.960
and report that
Brady's here.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.750
No, we should follow him
and see what he's doing.

12:06.750 --> 12:07.880
We know what he's doing.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.380
He's zipping around the halls.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.120
What we don't know
is what Jin is doing.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.120
I think we both know
what Jin is doing.

12:13.120 --> 12:17.040
Walrus Jin,
Walrus Jin,
Walrus Jin!

12:17.040 --> 12:20.250
I'm the leader,
and we're gonna find out
what Brady's doing here.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.040
Come on.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.170
Quick, Howard, I need
one of your high-tech gadgets

12:33.170 --> 12:34.620
to hear what's going on.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.210
I could've done that.

12:43.210 --> 12:44.960
And yet, you didn't.

12:47.670 --> 12:51.080
BRADY: We gathered
enough information
to begin the process

12:51.080 --> 12:54.380
of brainwashing
our teenage audience.

12:54.380 --> 12:57.290
Before you know it,
they'll do anything we want.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.880
The Alternate
will reign supreme.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.210
Buzziebuzz
isn't just a website.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.880
It's a front for
the Alternate.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.250
I knew those clickbait
quizzes were annoying.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.460
Didn't know
they were evil, too.

13:08.460 --> 13:10.620
Come on, we have to get
back to the van now.

13:14.250 --> 13:18.120
There you guys are.
What is going on?

13:18.120 --> 13:20.670
How are you speaking
English again?

13:20.670 --> 13:22.750
I reprogrammed
our devices.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.460
Let me fix
yours, Lecia.

13:25.460 --> 13:27.080
Oh, thank you.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.620
Why'd you take my mango juice?
I wasn't done with it.

13:30.620 --> 13:35.330
Don't hit me.
I bruise like a peach.

13:35.330 --> 13:37.250
Nobody's hitting anybody.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.080
Guys, we just found out
Buzziebuzz is a front

13:40.080 --> 13:41.710
for the Alternate,

13:41.710 --> 13:44.080
and they're about to brainwash
kids all over the world.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.710
Isn't this great?

13:45.710 --> 13:47.960
We observed, and now we have
great info to report.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.920
No. We're not
reporting anything.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.250
We're taking action.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.080
We're going back in,
downloading their data,

13:56.080 --> 13:57.960
and destroying
their mainframe.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.500
But that's not our mission.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.750
Besides, we cannot
handle that.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.250
We're just
the van people.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.120
Guys, listen to me.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.210
I believe in us.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.460
We're not just van people.

14:10.460 --> 14:13.120
There's a reason you were
all picked for this program.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.330
We are not
very good at our jobs?

14:16.330 --> 14:18.420
They didn't have
anywhere else to send us?

14:18.420 --> 14:22.040
I won
the office raffle!

14:22.040 --> 14:25.330
No. The reason is because
we're all good at something,

14:25.330 --> 14:27.330
and we can learn
from each other.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.830
Amelie,
what's your specialty?

14:28.830 --> 14:31.330
I am an expert coder.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.330
Great. So you can
create the virus

14:33.330 --> 14:35.250
that will destroy
their mainframe.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.920
- Lecia, what can you do?
- I can hack.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.120
So you can get past
the mainframe's firewalls,

14:40.120 --> 14:41.540
and upload the virus.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.460
And you, Jin.
What are you good at?

14:43.460 --> 14:46.210
I am an architectural
engineer.

14:46.210 --> 14:48.790
Now all of the pencils
make sense.

14:48.790 --> 14:51.080
And you can read
the building's schematics,

14:51.080 --> 14:53.380
and lead us to
the mainframe.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.380
I don't know
about this, Ernie.

14:55.380 --> 14:56.710
Well, I do.

14:56.710 --> 14:58.960
All around the world,

14:58.960 --> 15:00.420
they make fun of
the van guys.

15:00.420 --> 15:03.420
We may not be
impressive on our own,

15:03.420 --> 15:07.250
but together, we make
one good agent.

15:08.290 --> 15:10.710
Starting today, we will
no longer be

15:10.710 --> 15:12.250
the butt of their jokes.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.460
We're gonna show them
that us jokes

15:14.460 --> 15:16.790
are better than
they think.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.880
Ernie's right.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.620
I am a joke.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.750
- I am a joke.
- We're all jokes.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.960
And Ernie is
the biggest joke of us all.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.880
No, no, no, no.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.540
That's not what I...

15:28.540 --> 15:32.210
Joke, joke, joke, joke,
joke, joke, joke, joke!

15:32.210 --> 15:34.120
( chanting continues )

15:45.250 --> 15:48.210
Okay, guys,
Lecia and I are in.
Where's Howard?

15:48.210 --> 15:50.420
I'm in position.

15:50.420 --> 15:52.790
But don't call me Howard.
Use my code name.

15:52.790 --> 15:54.960
Huggy Bear.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.380
Howard, I am not
calling you Huggy Bear.

15:58.380 --> 15:59.670
Now let's get ready.

15:59.670 --> 16:01.830
It's time to bake
the biscuits.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.830
Time to wrap the tamales.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.880
Time to make
the crepe batter.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.830
Time to ferment the kimchi.

16:07.830 --> 16:10.460
Okay, Jin,
where do we go?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.330
According to
the schematic,

16:12.330 --> 16:14.920
you should take
the stairwell to
the fourth floor.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.380
And the third door
on the right

16:17.380 --> 16:18.710
is where you'll
find the mainframe.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.210
Got it.
Let's move.

16:34.290 --> 16:36.380
The door's locked.
You're up, Howard.

16:36.380 --> 16:39.120
( clears throat )

16:39.120 --> 16:42.210
Fine. You're up,
Huggy Bear.

16:51.330 --> 16:54.170
We're in.
Amelie, Lecia, you're up.

16:54.170 --> 16:56.420
Okay, let me know
when you get past the firewall,

16:56.420 --> 16:58.210
and I'll remotely
upload the virus.

17:01.460 --> 17:02.710
Okay, I'm in.

17:02.710 --> 17:04.380
AMELIE:
I'm receiving the data.

17:04.380 --> 17:06.750
It will take a few minutes
to upload the virus.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.290
Howard, keep an eye out,
and let me know if
someone is coming.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.330
Someone's coming.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.500
Exactly. When someone comes,
you say that.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.960
Someone's coming.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.330
Right.
When you see someone,

17:17.330 --> 17:18.750
that's exactly
what you say.

17:18.750 --> 17:21.540
Someone's here.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.790
Brady.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.790
Hello, Ernie.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.460
Hello...

17:28.920 --> 17:32.540
Trey Appleton Junior?!

17:32.540 --> 17:35.790
Actually, the name is
Huggy Bear.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.380
Howard.
I'm Howard.

17:40.380 --> 17:42.080
What are you guys
doing here?

17:42.080 --> 17:43.500
I know what you're
up to, Brady.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.380
You don't know
what you're talking about.

17:45.380 --> 17:48.830
Hold them off.
The information
is still downloading.

17:48.830 --> 17:51.000
You'd think for
a fancy website company,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.120
they'd have
better Wi-Fi.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.540
Ernie, you need
to listen to me.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.250
You're making
a big mistake.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.580
Big mistake. I bet that's
what the doctor said

17:59.580 --> 18:01.500
when you were born.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.040
Ernie, I'm telling you
to back down.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.500
Too late.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.460
I'm serving biscuits
with a two-piece.

18:35.170 --> 18:37.250
Sorry. Not sorry.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.080
- Huh?
- Made you look!

18:47.000 --> 18:48.040
Ernie, stop.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.880
Ernie. Ernie.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.170
There's something
I have to tell you.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.210
Tell it to
my size tens.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.290
Ernie, use the pens.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.290
Wait, Ernie, Ernie,
no, no, no.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.380
The virus is uploaded.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.670
The system is now corrupt.

19:16.670 --> 19:17.960
BOTH: Yes!

19:19.330 --> 19:20.880
We did it, guys.
We did it!

19:20.880 --> 19:22.670
Ernie, congratulations!

19:22.670 --> 19:24.500
Mission accomplished.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.250
( sighs )

19:26.250 --> 19:28.460
I never thought
I'd hear those words.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.580
- Let me just take it in
and enjoy this moment.
- ( alarm blares )

19:31.580 --> 19:32.670
COMPUTER VOICE:
Security breached.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.500
Okay, moment's over.
Let's go.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.830
Good afternoon,
Agent Johnson.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.670
Ernie Cooper's
van team reporting.

19:44.670 --> 19:46.830
I don't remember saying
you had to come in.

19:46.830 --> 19:49.170
Couldn't you just
email me?

19:49.170 --> 19:52.250
Well, it's kinda hard
to send an enemy agent

19:52.250 --> 19:54.710
as an attachment.

19:54.710 --> 19:57.080
Wait a minute.
Is that--

19:57.080 --> 19:59.330
ERNIE:
In the flesh.

19:59.330 --> 20:01.960
I know you just told us
to observe and report.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.380
But that was
a real snooze-a-roony.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.380
Long story short,
we found Brady,

20:07.380 --> 20:08.920
and brought him in.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.120
Even though it wasn't
part of your mission.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.380
That's correct, sir.

20:12.380 --> 20:13.920
So you wanna start

20:13.920 --> 20:15.620
the promotion
ceremony now or...

20:17.080 --> 20:19.080
No, actually,

20:19.080 --> 20:21.620
I'm gonna yell at you
like I've never yelled
at you before.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.790
Wait, what? Why?

20:22.790 --> 20:24.330
We turned Brady.

20:24.330 --> 20:26.710
He was working for us
as a double agent.

20:26.710 --> 20:28.620
I was the inside
guy, Ernie.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.540
At least until
you dragged me outside.

20:30.540 --> 20:33.540
He was giving us
important intel
about the Alternate.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.880
Tried to tell him, boss.
He just wouldn't listen.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.040
Sir, I, uh...

20:37.040 --> 20:40.330
I didn't realize.

20:40.330 --> 20:42.540
I mean...

20:42.540 --> 20:44.540
Sorry.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.620
Come on, Brady.
We need to figure out

20:46.620 --> 20:48.330
a way to get
you back in.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.540
I'll deal with you later.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.750
Who am I kidding?

20:56.750 --> 20:58.750
I'm no leader.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.880
I guess,
once a van guy,

21:01.880 --> 21:03.880
always a van guy.

21:07.710 --> 21:10.170
Hey, forget Johnson.

21:10.170 --> 21:12.000
You are a leader.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.620
This was the best mission
I've ever been on.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.580
Yes. Because of you,

21:16.580 --> 21:18.750
I feel like I can be
a better agent.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.380
And you made me
believe in myself.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.380
In fact, I'm going to apply
to be a field agent.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.960
Thanks to you,
I know I can do it.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.710
You really have
inspired us all

21:28.710 --> 21:30.170
to be the best
that we can be.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.330
You know what?

21:35.330 --> 21:37.210
It's true.

21:37.210 --> 21:39.380
So what if we
defied orders,

21:39.380 --> 21:41.120
and ruined an important

21:41.120 --> 21:43.210
double-agent
intelligence-gathering mission?

21:43.210 --> 21:45.580
The important thing is,

21:45.580 --> 21:48.330
we ruined it
as a team!

21:50.620 --> 21:53.120
Today, I,
Ernie Cooper,

21:53.120 --> 21:54.750
am proud to say,

21:54.750 --> 21:56.920
I am a van person!
