<i>I think my whole life
has been decided by fate.</i>

02:08.460 --> 02:10.494
<i>Have you ever
had what some might term</i>

02:10.496 --> 02:12.298
<i>a psychic experience?</i>

02:19.205 --> 02:21.441
Yes, in fact, I have.

02:22.741 --> 02:25.245
I guess that's what
it was, anyway.

02:25.477 --> 02:27.546
I guess you could
call it a nightmare.

02:29.882 --> 02:33.920
It was a terribly frightening
and disturbing thing for me.

02:35.253 --> 02:38.888
My husband Roman and I had
recently rented this beautiful

02:38.890 --> 02:41.293
home up in the hills
of Hollywood.

02:42.961 --> 02:44.894
It's been around for quite
some time

02:44.896 --> 02:47.733
and many famous people
have lived there before us.

02:47.932 --> 02:51.000
Lillian Gish, and Cary Grant,

02:51.002 --> 02:53.772
and most recently the record
producer Terry Melcher

02:54.006 --> 02:56.376
and his girlfriend
Candice Bergen

02:56.609 --> 02:57.941
who are friends of ours.

02:57.943 --> 03:02.182
Anyway, it was about a week
or so after we moved in

03:02.647 --> 03:05.651
and I was awoken by something
in the middle of the night.

03:09.955 --> 03:12.458
So, I turned on the light,

03:13.425 --> 03:15.659
and that's when I saw
this strange man

03:15.661 --> 03:18.598
just standing in the door frame
of our bedroom.

03:19.564 --> 03:21.300
So, I got out of bed.

03:25.503 --> 03:27.806
<i>And I followed him
down into the living room.</i>

03:37.716 --> 03:40.385
And that's when I saw two people

03:40.818 --> 03:43.288
had been tied to the rafters
in the ceiling.

03:45.324 --> 03:48.591
And as I moved closer,
I realized it was my friend

03:48.593 --> 03:50.530
Jay Sebring and me,

03:51.296 --> 03:55.501
and both of us had been cut open
at the throat.

04:38.476 --> 04:40.644
<i>In a scene
described by one investigator</i>

04:40.646 --> 04:42.779
<i>as reminiscent of a weird
religious rite,</i>

04:42.781 --> 04:45.382
<i>five persons, including actress
Sharon Tate</i>

04:45.384 --> 04:47.584
<i>were found dead
at the home of Ms. Tate</i>

04:47.586 --> 04:49.855
<i>and her husband,
screen director Roman Polanski.</i>

05:02.668 --> 05:05.135
<i>Ms. Tate, who starred
in</i> Valley of the Dolls

05:05.137 --> 05:06.836
<i>was eight months pregnant</i>

05:06.838 --> 05:09.106
<i>and was found in a bikini type
nightgown</i>

05:09.108 --> 05:10.574
<i>with a rope around her neck</i>

05:10.576 --> 05:12.078
<i>attached to the body of a man.</i>

05:27.593 --> 05:29.925
<i>When police arrived,
they found the telephones</i>

05:29.927 --> 05:31.728
<i>and electricity lines cut.</i>

05:31.730 --> 05:34.067
<i>The bodies had been dead
about 12 hours.</i>

06:10.769 --> 06:14.874
We drove to the house,
uh, with instructions...

06:15.841 --> 06:17.707
to kill everyone in the house.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.011
- From Charlie?
- Yeah.

06:20.312 --> 06:21.377
<i>Manson led
a cult of young rebellious</i>

06:21.379 --> 06:24.384
<i>runaways, who followed his
every instruction.</i>

07:15.901 --> 07:17.868
It was like
I was caught in something

07:17.870 --> 07:19.502
that I had no control over.

07:19.504 --> 07:22.639
I had absolutely no say
so as to what was happening now.

07:22.641 --> 07:25.774
I was just like a tool
in the hands of the devil,

07:25.776 --> 07:27.479
is the only way
I can put it.

07:59.043 --> 08:01.211
<i>One officer
summed up the murders</i>

08:01.213 --> 08:03.012
<i>when he said,
"In all my years,</i>

08:03.014 --> 08:05.918
<i>I have never seen anything
like this before."</i>

09:30.302 --> 09:31.870
My love house.

09:32.671 --> 09:35.141
I started to feel like
I might never see it again.

09:36.642 --> 09:40.079
Did you know that <i>"cielo"</i>
means "heaven" in Spanish?

09:40.979 --> 09:42.811
Well, your heavenly hideaway

09:42.813 --> 09:44.781
hasn't changed much
in six months.

09:44.783 --> 09:46.318
Not that I can say
the same for you.

09:47.885 --> 09:49.285
Are you gonna give me a hand

09:49.287 --> 09:51.190
or just let me roast to death
in this car?

09:52.658 --> 09:56.128
Hey, these hands
are my livelihood.

09:56.961 --> 09:59.329
Besides, I don't know
if I'm strong enough

09:59.331 --> 10:01.363
- to lift you up.
- You creep!

10:01.365 --> 10:03.168
- Take it back right now.
- Never!

10:03.902 --> 10:06.605
- Come on, one, two, and we go.
- Phew!

10:08.173 --> 10:10.739
- You okay?
- Starting to get used to this.

10:10.741 --> 10:11.943
You're an old pro.

10:15.379 --> 10:18.350
You think it's possible to fall
in love at first sight twice?

10:19.051 --> 10:21.417
You're the one who left me
for another man, remember?

10:21.419 --> 10:23.453
Well, you didn't become
a stylist to the stars

10:23.455 --> 10:25.689
by just running your fingers
through their hair.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.892
What can I say?

10:27.091 --> 10:28.791
I like to keep my clients happy.

11:05.263 --> 11:06.399
Hello?

11:10.101 --> 11:11.437
Is anyone home?

11:11.937 --> 11:14.340
Surprise.

11:14.873 --> 11:16.138
What on Earth?

11:16.140 --> 11:18.440
Doctor Saperstein,
come here, boy.

11:18.442 --> 11:19.876
Come here.

11:19.878 --> 11:21.947
Oh, I missed you.

11:22.313 --> 11:24.449
- Welcome home.
- Hi, Gib.

11:26.518 --> 11:29.288
Oh, my goodness,
I can't believe it.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.024
Shar, you look like
you're about to burst.

11:33.258 --> 11:35.057
That's about how I feel
right now.

11:35.059 --> 11:37.359
Welcome home, doll.
You shouldn't be on your feet.

11:37.361 --> 11:38.560
Our beautiful Sharon.

11:38.562 --> 11:41.531
And where's that rat bastard
husband of yours, hmm, hmm?

11:41.533 --> 11:43.168
Oh, oh.

11:43.802 --> 11:46.770
Oh, it's good to see
you too, Wojciech.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.839
You do remember she's married
to your best friend, right?

11:49.841 --> 11:53.041
Don't be jealous, baby,
you know I'm all yours.

11:53.043 --> 11:55.480
Surprise.

11:56.447 --> 11:59.018
- Thanks a lot.
- We thought you were Roman.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.984
- Oh, Roman is not here.
- What do you mean?

12:01.986 --> 12:04.787
He decided to stay in London
to finish the script

12:04.789 --> 12:07.089
for a few weeks, but he promised
he's going to be home

12:07.091 --> 12:08.791
before the baby arrives.

12:08.793 --> 12:10.228
Yeah, well, he better be.

12:10.427 --> 12:14.129
Holy shit, close your eyes,
I have a surprise for you.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.473
- What's this all about?
- Okay, okay, get ready.

12:20.905 --> 12:22.040
Surprise.

12:23.808 --> 12:25.177
Oh, my goodness.

12:26.076 --> 12:27.377
Oh.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.748
Gib.

12:29.047 --> 12:30.382
Don't you just love it?

12:30.916 --> 12:32.051
Yes.

12:34.219 --> 12:35.951
It's just...
Well, you know,

12:35.953 --> 12:38.488
I planned to work on the nursery
myself while I waited for Roman

12:38.490 --> 12:41.092
- to come home.
- But now you don't have to.

12:41.326 --> 12:43.995
Look, I took care of everything
for you.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.532
So is that really his excuse?

12:50.534 --> 12:52.871
It's an important project
for him, Gib.

12:53.171 --> 12:55.204
He's got a lot
riding on this one.

12:55.206 --> 12:58.174
Yes. Well, I can see how a film
called <i>Day of the Dolphin</i>

12:58.176 --> 13:00.075
would be more important
than coming home

13:00.077 --> 13:02.344
and spending time with your
eight months pregnant wife.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.314
Gibby.

13:03.615 --> 13:06.015
You know,
it is just like a man

13:06.017 --> 13:09.017
to take his priorities and shove
them sideways up his ass.

13:09.019 --> 13:11.289
Gib, I'm fine.
We're fine.

13:11.623 --> 13:13.522
Well, my lovely, you can forget
about any kind

13:13.524 --> 13:14.994
of personal privacy now.

13:15.226 --> 13:17.126
You've got your two
loyal house sitters

13:17.128 --> 13:19.395
staying on to look after you,
not to mention

13:19.397 --> 13:21.330
your adoring public,
all of whom eagerly await

13:21.332 --> 13:24.032
the return of the star
of <i>The Twelve Chairs.</i>

13:24.034 --> 13:26.070
- Of <i>The Thirteen Chairs.</i>
- What?

13:26.471 --> 13:29.137
Yeah, the studio
decided to change the title.

13:29.139 --> 13:31.507
I think they figured
twelve chairs wasn't enough

13:31.509 --> 13:34.209
once they saw the size
of my ever-expanding ass.

13:34.211 --> 13:36.012
That is nonsense.

13:36.014 --> 13:37.647
The extra chair is
for Orson Welles.

13:37.649 --> 13:40.285
Have you seen the size
of his ass lately?

13:40.552 --> 13:42.318
Well, here's
to Orson Welles.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.123
And to Sharon Tate Polanski

13:44.322 --> 13:47.091
and her once spectacular ass.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.392
May it find its
way home soon.

13:49.394 --> 13:50.428
Please.

14:26.563 --> 14:28.196
So the next time I meet him,

14:28.198 --> 14:30.199
I'm trying to get into this
school dance, but,

14:30.201 --> 14:33.069
guarding the entrance,
there's a strange little guy.

14:33.071 --> 14:34.570
Now to me he
looks like an elf,

14:34.572 --> 14:37.406
one of those, um...
The lawns that you, uh...

14:37.408 --> 14:40.509
- A gnome?
- A gnome, yes, thank you.

14:40.511 --> 14:42.377
And this little gnome,

14:42.379 --> 14:44.379
he refuses to let me
into the dance

14:44.381 --> 14:46.482
because the teacher
says I have a reputation

14:46.484 --> 14:48.450
- for making trouble.
- Mm.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.890
So I tell him, in my most
intimidating voice,

14:52.724 --> 14:54.894
"You want to see how much
trouble I can make?

14:55.092 --> 14:57.262
You just keep
standing in my way."

14:58.395 --> 15:01.397
And then he gets right
up to my face and says,

15:01.399 --> 15:05.068
"Well, give it your best shot."

15:05.070 --> 15:07.236
A week later, I buy him drinks,

15:07.238 --> 15:10.576
and I give him money
to make his first film.

15:12.243 --> 15:14.176
This is how I meet
Roman Polanski.

15:14.178 --> 15:16.548
- The end.
- Yes.

15:16.981 --> 15:19.183
Earth to Sharon.

15:19.517 --> 15:21.520
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15:22.086 --> 15:23.121
I'm fine.

15:24.322 --> 15:26.557
What is going on inside that
pretty little head of yours?

15:28.360 --> 15:31.964
Well, I... I guess it was
what you were just saying.

15:32.297 --> 15:34.664
Like, how the simplest
of choices

15:34.666 --> 15:37.269
can affect the entire
outcome of our lives.

15:37.469 --> 15:40.402
Wojciech, what if you
had never had that run

15:40.404 --> 15:42.408
in with Roman
at your school dance?

15:43.408 --> 15:45.141
And what if I
had never wandered

15:45.143 --> 15:47.410
onto that movie set
when I was 17?

15:47.412 --> 15:49.579
I mean, I had always dreamed
of being an actress,

15:49.581 --> 15:52.681
but what if I hadn't have
been at that exact place,

15:52.683 --> 15:54.218
on that exact day?

15:54.686 --> 15:56.021
Do you know what I mean?

15:56.287 --> 15:58.423
Like, is life just some...

15:59.423 --> 16:02.025
random series of coincidences,

16:02.027 --> 16:04.028
or is there some greater plan?

16:04.294 --> 16:07.298
Some higher purpose
for all of us?

16:08.533 --> 16:12.568
Don't you ever think about
how our smallest decisions

16:12.570 --> 16:15.741
can somehow change the course
of everything?

16:16.341 --> 16:19.208
Honey, with your talent
and those God-given looks,

16:19.210 --> 16:20.612
you were destined to be a star.

16:21.578 --> 16:25.547
Me? Well, I'll forever be
known as Abigail Folder,

16:25.549 --> 16:27.382
queen of your morning
cup of coffee.

16:27.384 --> 16:29.053
- Gib.
- Look,

16:29.486 --> 16:31.656
your career,
you and Roman,

16:32.090 --> 16:34.526
and that beautiful baby you are
about to bring into the world,

16:35.059 --> 16:36.461
it was all meant to be.

16:37.828 --> 16:40.463
We can all look back
at the choices we've made,

16:40.465 --> 16:42.265
the roads taken
and not taken,

16:42.267 --> 16:44.636
and wonder if this is all
life has in store for us.

16:45.202 --> 16:49.071
But, as for you, Sharon Tate,
well, I think life

16:49.073 --> 16:51.642
is working out exactly
how it's supposed to.

17:27.178 --> 17:27.945
You okay?

17:30.381 --> 17:32.250
I think he's having
another affair.

17:33.718 --> 17:36.455
- What makes you say that?
- Because I just know.

17:39.723 --> 17:41.793
Do you know how our
arrangement works?

17:42.527 --> 17:45.096
Roman lies to me, and I
pretend to believe him.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.668
It doesn't have
to be like this, Sharon.

17:50.535 --> 17:53.072
- You always have a choice.
- He's my husband.

17:53.805 --> 17:55.740
We're about to have
our first child.

17:56.807 --> 17:58.609
We'll figure it out somehow.

18:00.744 --> 18:02.411
Come back inside, you guys,

18:02.413 --> 18:04.149
you have got to see this.

18:08.653 --> 18:10.719
I found it in the attic
a couple days ago,

18:10.721 --> 18:11.856
I'll go first.

18:12.289 --> 18:14.225
- This is so silly.
- Oooh.

18:17.162 --> 18:20.499
Will Sharon have a beautiful
baby girl?

18:27.305 --> 18:29.505
- Oh.
- I knew it,

18:29.507 --> 18:31.207
- I knew you were having a boy.
- Okay,

18:31.209 --> 18:32.941
I love you,
but you are ridiculous.

18:32.943 --> 18:34.879
Okay. Okay, come on,
it's your turn.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.850
Okay, um... Hmm.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.889
Will I live a long, happy life?

18:57.835 --> 18:58.871
Who is that?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.740
I got it.

19:02.339 --> 19:04.274
I'm coming, I'm coming.

19:08.346 --> 19:10.414
Be quiet,
Doctor Saperstein.

19:12.549 --> 19:13.751
What do you want?

19:17.622 --> 19:19.689
Sorry, man,
I've told you before,

19:19.691 --> 19:22.225
you've got the wrong house.
Like I keep telling you.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.361
Terry doesn't live
here anymore.

19:25.363 --> 19:28.663
This is the home of Roman
Polanski and Sharon Tate.

19:28.665 --> 19:30.632
If you see him,
can you let him know

19:30.634 --> 19:32.637
I need to talk to him?
Just really quick.

19:33.637 --> 19:35.438
Yeah, cool, man, peace.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.708
Thanks, brother.

19:59.396 --> 20:01.463
- Who is that?
- Just some odd ball

20:01.465 --> 20:03.534
who keeps coming around
looking for Terry Melcher.

20:13.411 --> 20:14.680
Did he tell you his name?

20:14.979 --> 20:15.913
Uh...

20:16.413 --> 20:17.682
I don't remember.

20:18.615 --> 20:20.586
Charlie.
Charlie something, I think.

21:29.354 --> 21:30.855
Damn you, Roman.

21:38.796 --> 21:40.632
Seriously, you guys?

23:17.694 --> 23:19.563
Hey.

23:20.530 --> 23:22.032
What's going on, boy?

23:22.967 --> 23:25.437
Hey. Did you hear something?

24:51.221 --> 24:53.087
Who the hell
is it at this hour?

24:54.325 --> 24:56.528
- Who was that?
- Stay back.

24:57.595 --> 24:59.698
You got some nerve.
Doctor Saperstein.

24:59.896 --> 25:01.229
No, don't!

25:01.231 --> 25:02.666
Doctor Saperstein.

25:24.355 --> 25:25.323
What is that?

25:26.022 --> 25:28.526
That's... The weirdo
must have left it earlier.

25:29.626 --> 25:31.994
I want to get that gate checked
in the morning, okay?

25:31.996 --> 25:33.996
No one should be allowed
on this property

25:33.998 --> 25:35.631
- without the code.
- Of course.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.865
Yeah, we'll get it changed.
Don't, don't worry, Sharon,

25:37.867 --> 25:39.637
we're here to take care
of you, all right?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.608
Do you think
we're the only ones here?

26:18.308 --> 26:20.976
It's like the entire
world is still asleep.

26:20.978 --> 26:23.315
I say enjoy it while you can.

26:23.847 --> 26:26.817
Everything has been so quiet
since I got back.

26:27.084 --> 26:29.821
I thought the phone
would be ringing off the hook.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.386
I guess it's true
what they say:

26:31.388 --> 26:33.023
"Out of sight, out of mind."

26:33.223 --> 26:34.925
Doctor's orders, remember?

26:35.159 --> 26:36.924
He doesn't want you under
any stress

26:36.926 --> 26:39.728
until that baby arrives,
so I put the word out.

26:39.730 --> 26:42.067
No calls unless
it's an absolute emergency.

26:42.799 --> 26:46.171
Well, thanks for that,
but I'm not exactly an invalid.

26:48.439 --> 26:51.142
So, how are things going
with you and Wojciech?

26:52.375 --> 26:54.742
Yeah, I didn't want
to say anything yesterday,

26:54.744 --> 26:56.745
but, look, after what
happened last night,

26:56.747 --> 26:58.083
I just thought
you should know.

26:59.717 --> 27:00.884
Know what?

27:01.986 --> 27:02.884
I've just been a little
concerned about some

27:02.886 --> 27:05.120
of the types he's had over
at the house

27:05.122 --> 27:06.421
while you've been away.

27:06.423 --> 27:09.094
- What do you mean?
- It's just...

27:09.693 --> 27:11.093
Woj's new friends,

27:11.095 --> 27:13.362
I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with them,

27:13.364 --> 27:15.831
and you know me,
I'm all about 'do whatever

27:15.833 --> 27:18.303
and be whatever'. But
some of these cats are...

27:18.836 --> 27:19.938
What?

27:20.203 --> 27:22.203
They're just strange,

27:22.205 --> 27:24.139
I don't know
how else to explain it.

27:24.141 --> 27:26.144
They've been making the rounds
with their stuff.

27:26.343 --> 27:29.378
Brian, Nancy, Cass,
that whole scene.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.978
- Mm.
- Well, they're all using it.

27:30.980 --> 27:34.415
And you know a little
experimentation is one thing,

27:34.417 --> 27:36.654
but the dope
these guys are selling...

27:36.886 --> 27:38.255
it's pretty extreme.

27:39.323 --> 27:41.989
You know Roman and I
are all about guests.

27:41.991 --> 27:44.459
I mean, our home is an open
space for our friends

27:44.461 --> 27:46.128
and that's how we like it.

27:46.130 --> 27:49.701
But, I don't like the idea
of some underworld...

28:12.823 --> 28:14.025
Maybe we should head back.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.857
Relax, it's fine.

28:15.859 --> 28:18.028
I'm just...
I'm feeling a little bit tired.

28:19.262 --> 28:21.095
Well, come on,
I know a shortcut.

28:21.097 --> 28:22.099
Okay.

28:34.878 --> 28:36.978
- You still with me, Shar?
- Yep.

28:36.980 --> 28:39.046
- Can you make it?
- I'm coming.

28:54.431 --> 28:55.467
No.

28:56.099 --> 28:57.868
Oh, no.

29:02.071 --> 29:03.073
No!

29:26.596 --> 29:28.031
It's my fault.

29:29.834 --> 29:32.100
I should have gone
after him last night.

29:32.102 --> 29:33.104
No.

29:34.238 --> 29:36.103
Sharon, there is no way
any of us could have possibly

29:36.105 --> 29:37.372
known this would happen.

29:37.374 --> 29:39.309
He stays outside at night
all the time.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.553
We found a nice spot for him
in the garden.

29:49.118 --> 29:52.055
I'm very sorry
for your loss, Ms. Tate.

29:52.890 --> 29:55.093
I'm sorry,
who are you?

29:55.291 --> 29:57.461
My name is Steven, ma'am,
Steven Parent.

29:57.894 --> 29:59.393
I've been staying out
in the trailer

29:59.395 --> 30:00.531
for the past few weeks.

30:01.065 --> 30:03.097
I thought Will
lived in the trailer.

30:03.099 --> 30:04.900
Will hasn't been around
for a while.

30:04.902 --> 30:07.271
He and Steven are friends,
so he's been filling in

30:07.570 --> 30:09.940
to help keep things nice
for you and Roman.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.144
That's odd, no one
mentioned that to me.

30:15.078 --> 30:17.045
I'm sorry, ma'am,
if you want me to go,

30:17.047 --> 30:18.546
I'll completely understand.

30:18.548 --> 30:21.552
No, you're welcome
to stay. It's...

30:24.288 --> 30:26.488
I just hadn't been made aware
there was a new caretaker,

30:26.490 --> 30:27.392
that's all.

30:29.593 --> 30:31.559
Well, I'll be out
back working on my car

30:31.561 --> 30:33.394
if you need anything. Um...

30:33.396 --> 30:36.030
I'm really pleased
to finally meet you, ma'am,

30:36.032 --> 30:38.969
I really enjoyed your work
in <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

30:46.343 --> 30:48.112
He's a really
good kid, Shar.

30:48.378 --> 30:50.048
And he's a hard worker.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.114
- I must've forgotten to mention.
- Is there anything else

30:53.116 --> 30:54.451
I should be made aware of?

30:55.184 --> 30:57.451
Any other changes you took it
upon yourselves to make

30:57.453 --> 30:58.589
while Roman and I were away?

30:59.022 --> 31:00.390
I know you're upset, Sharon.

31:01.458 --> 31:02.961
I'm the one to blame here.

31:03.359 --> 31:05.096
I should have brought
the dog inside.

31:08.265 --> 31:09.567
Maybe you should have.

32:53.436 --> 32:54.571

35:20.583 --> 35:21.950
Sharon, what's wrong,
what happened?

35:21.952 --> 35:23.454
I played that tape.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.289
The voice,
it's that creepy man.

35:26.856 --> 35:28.490
You're burning up.

35:28.492 --> 35:30.327
Let's get you outside,
come on.

35:30.693 --> 35:31.896
All right.

35:57.487 --> 35:59.624
Hey, feeling any better?

35:59.822 --> 36:01.222
Come on.

36:04.460 --> 36:07.864
Oh, I just really, really hope
he didn't suffer out there...

36:08.632 --> 36:09.634
all alone.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.769
Sometimes bad
things just happen.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.903
You can't protect everything,
or everyone.

36:15.905 --> 36:18.742
I just...
I wish Roman were here.

36:19.775 --> 36:23.380
This is supposed to be our home.
Roman, me, the baby.

36:24.514 --> 36:26.717
Yet, I just feel
like a stranger here.

36:27.918 --> 36:30.755
It's like they've
just taken over.

36:32.456 --> 36:34.521
And I appreciate
what they're doing,

36:34.523 --> 36:36.490
- but it's all...
- A little much.

36:36.492 --> 36:37.858
That's being nice.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.262
They are constantly
in my business,

36:40.264 --> 36:41.829
making decisions for me,

36:41.831 --> 36:43.934
acting like they own my house.

36:44.501 --> 36:46.537
Roman is going to be home soon,
and then...

36:46.769 --> 36:48.838
you can kiss the squatters
from Hell goodbye.

36:49.438 --> 36:52.509
So, I was thinking,
maybe later...

36:54.443 --> 36:56.846
Do you think that we are slaves
to our own destiny?

36:58.815 --> 36:59.684
This again.

36:59.882 --> 37:00.850
I mean...

37:02.052 --> 37:04.552
do you think it's possible
to alter the course of our fate,

37:04.554 --> 37:06.523
or is our story just our book...

37:07.324 --> 37:08.826
written before we
were even born?

37:09.826 --> 37:11.762
I like to think
that anything is possible.

37:13.396 --> 37:15.563
You know, I think there's
infinite choices,

37:15.565 --> 37:17.699
infinite realities.

37:17.701 --> 37:20.338
We might be living out different
versions of our own story

37:21.438 --> 37:23.673
for who knows?
Probably forever.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.443
At least, until
we get it right.

37:28.679 --> 37:30.715
I guess in movie speak,
it means we can...

37:30.981 --> 37:32.717
re-write our own scripts.

37:33.983 --> 37:35.952
And I think no matter
which road we choose,

37:37.320 --> 37:39.322
we always arrive
at the same place.

37:41.391 --> 37:42.726
What's this all about?

37:43.626 --> 37:44.862
I don't know...

37:45.929 --> 37:48.599
just my maternal instincts
kicking in, I guess.

37:50.967 --> 37:52.534
Get some rest, beautiful.

37:52.536 --> 37:54.304
That goes for both of you.

37:54.670 --> 37:56.339
No serious thoughts tonight.

37:57.873 --> 38:00.041
I'll be at the bottom
of the canyon if you need me.

38:00.043 --> 38:02.811
And you know I can run these
stairs in record time.

38:02.813 --> 38:04.979
- My hero.
- Don't forget,

38:04.981 --> 38:06.617
we have dinner at El Coyote
tomorrow night.

38:06.916 --> 38:08.351
I know.

38:08.617 --> 38:09.719
Smile.

38:18.394 --> 38:19.896

Who the fuck are you?

43:22.065 --> 43:23.067
I'm the devil.

43:24.001 --> 43:25.700
And I'm here to do
the devil's business.

43:25.702 --> 43:27.237
Why are you doing this?

43:29.905 --> 43:31.741
No, no, no, no, no, no.

43:33.208 --> 43:34.941
Don't hurt her,
she's pregnant!

43:34.943 --> 43:37.811
Please!
Please!

43:37.813 --> 43:39.914
It looks like we'll start
with you then, pretty boy.

43:39.916 --> 43:41.349
No, please no.

43:41.351 --> 43:43.186
Please, no, no, no.

44:33.869 --> 44:34.969
Run now, go!

44:34.971 --> 44:37.041
Go, go, go, run
and go now, go.

44:37.273 --> 44:40.041
Help, help, help!

44:40.043 --> 44:41.945
Help me, help me.

44:45.248 --> 44:47.351
Please don't kill me,
please, please.

44:47.751 --> 44:49.753
I just want to have my baby.

44:50.987 --> 44:53.287
Please just let me
live to have my baby.

44:53.289 --> 44:55.259
You must as well
face it right now,

44:56.192 --> 44:58.291
you're going to die,
and I don't feel a damn thing

44:58.293 --> 44:59.797
behind it.

45:07.070 --> 45:09.472
No!

45:12.976 --> 45:14.307
No!

45:17.313 --> 45:18.315
No!

45:24.019 --> 45:25.385
Please stop.

45:29.391 --> 45:33.059
Please. You got me,
I'm already, dead.

45:35.864 --> 45:37.467
I want my mother!

45:39.168 --> 45:41.504
No, no, God please help me!

45:42.070 --> 45:44.775
Help me!

45:45.074 --> 45:46.309
Sharon!

45:46.909 --> 45:49.946
<i>Help me!
Please, help me!</i>

45:54.083 --> 45:57.385
Somebody help me.

45:57.387 --> 45:59.954
It's all right. It's okay,
it was just a nightmare,

45:59.956 --> 46:03.356
it's over now. Shh, shh, shh.
We've got you, it's okay.

46:03.358 --> 46:04.958
- Sharon.
- You're okay.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.260
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

46:06.262 --> 46:07.898
You're okay.

46:08.164 --> 46:11.068
It was just like
that terrible dream I had.

46:12.135 --> 46:14.371
They were killing all of us.

46:15.471 --> 46:19.072
And my baby.

46:19.074 --> 46:20.409
It's okay,
you're okay.

46:41.630 --> 46:45.868
- Did you call Roman?
- Twice. Still no answer.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.139
What are we going to do?

46:49.539 --> 46:50.507
I don't know.

46:50.974 --> 46:52.273
I just...

46:52.275 --> 46:54.510
Morning, hon.
How are you feeling?

46:56.445 --> 46:58.281
Shar, are you okay?

47:02.117 --> 47:05.221
- What is that?
- What is what?

47:05.420 --> 47:09.023
That, that, that dead thing
in my refrigerator.

47:09.025 --> 47:12.559
- What dead thing?
- Right there, the dead animal.

47:12.561 --> 47:15.199
- Shar, I don't know what you'...
- It's right the...

47:16.666 --> 47:18.969
It was just... right there.

47:19.434 --> 47:22.139
Honey, I think you're just
overheated, okay?

47:23.338 --> 47:26.442
No! No, no, no, I just saw it,
it was right there.

47:28.043 --> 47:30.010
Are you two telling me
I'm seeing things

47:30.012 --> 47:31.315
that aren't there?

47:31.581 --> 47:33.916
Do you think
I've gone mad?

47:36.219 --> 47:37.588
Not at all, sweetie.

47:37.987 --> 47:40.220
Look, it is perfectly normal
for someone

47:40.222 --> 47:43.192
- in your condition to...
- Stop patronizing me.

47:44.059 --> 47:47.228
Ever since I got home,
all you two have done

47:47.230 --> 47:49.930
is tell me, "Stop worrying,
everything is fine,

47:49.932 --> 47:52.335
nothing is wrong."
But something is wrong.

47:52.969 --> 47:55.936
Something is, is very wrong
inside this house,

47:55.938 --> 47:57.273
and I can't explain it.

48:02.711 --> 48:04.914
Someone tell me
about this man.

48:05.581 --> 48:07.615
I want you to tell me
everything you know

48:07.617 --> 48:09.152
about this, this Charlie.

48:09.652 --> 48:11.952
Sweetie, you had a nightmare.

48:11.954 --> 48:14.557
It was a terrible one,
but that's all it was.

48:14.958 --> 48:17.992
I can't begin to imagine
the things that are going on

48:17.994 --> 48:19.360
inside your body right now.

48:19.362 --> 48:22.195
The chemical changes,
and the emotional stress.

48:22.197 --> 48:24.965
Hell, I would be scared shitless

48:24.967 --> 48:27.103
if I was about to have
my first baby.

48:27.402 --> 48:30.570
Also remember, you're the one
who's always telling me

48:30.572 --> 48:33.340
the things we manifest in life
come from the things

48:33.342 --> 48:34.978
that we put energy into.

48:42.552 --> 48:44.454
I don't know
what's going on here

48:44.653 --> 48:47.456
and I don't know how
you two are involved.

48:49.057 --> 48:51.425
But you have done nothing
but turn this house

48:51.427 --> 48:55.532
upside down and allow
God knows who on our property.

48:56.199 --> 48:58.666
Now someone tell me
who the hell this Charlie is,

48:58.668 --> 49:00.467
because I am not
staying here any longer,

49:00.469 --> 49:02.369
not for one more goddamn day.

49:02.371 --> 49:04.540
We don't know the guy,
Sharon, okay?

49:05.440 --> 49:06.676
I promise you.

49:07.275 --> 49:10.246
He came by here a couple times
while you were away.

49:10.545 --> 49:12.445
I think some of the girls
in his family...

49:12.447 --> 49:14.514
That's what he calls them...
They were at a couple

49:14.516 --> 49:15.719
of parties we had.

49:16.952 --> 49:19.686
But he is somehow convinced
Terry Melcher still lives here

49:19.688 --> 49:22.558
and promised him some kind
of bogus record deal.

49:23.092 --> 49:25.291
I swear to you,
that's all we know.

49:25.293 --> 49:28.528
Well, whoever he is,
and whoever this family

49:28.530 --> 49:31.467
of his is,
they are trying to kill me.

49:31.800 --> 49:33.434
And they're trying
to kill the baby,

49:33.436 --> 49:35.568
and I'm not going
to let that happen.

49:35.570 --> 49:38.342
Sharon, do you
hear what you're saying?

49:38.608 --> 49:40.474
You're sounding as
if you think there's some

49:40.476 --> 49:42.675
- kind of plot against you.
- This is not one

49:42.677 --> 49:44.744
- of Roman's movies.
- Don't tell me

49:44.746 --> 49:46.280
that I am making this up,

49:46.282 --> 49:49.083
that it is some figment
of my imagination, okay?

49:49.085 --> 49:51.684
This, this, this recording
that this guy left,

49:51.686 --> 49:56.456
it switched on last
night by itself, okay?

49:56.458 --> 49:59.226
They were in this house.
There was a man,

49:59.228 --> 50:02.429
and there was two women,
and they had a gun and knives,

50:02.431 --> 50:04.697
and they came here
to kill us all.

50:04.699 --> 50:06.068
Sharon, stop it.

50:07.402 --> 50:09.769
I understand that you're
under a tremendous strain

50:09.771 --> 50:11.604
and that you're upset
Roman is not here,

50:11.606 --> 50:13.840
but, God, this is just starting
to sound like you're...

50:13.842 --> 50:15.077
Crazy?

50:22.251 --> 50:23.687
I'll show you crazy.

50:33.096 --> 50:35.628
Sharon, we didn't
want you to worry.

50:35.630 --> 50:37.768
So you thought you
would hide them from me?

50:38.467 --> 50:42.105
How, how many times
has this creep been to my house?

50:44.539 --> 50:46.509
- How many times?
- I don't know.

50:46.775 --> 50:50.246
Look, we find them at odd
times, in different places.

50:50.512 --> 50:52.681
And did you ever
think to call the police?

50:53.215 --> 50:55.548
And tell them what,
that we're getting mail

50:55.550 --> 50:56.816
for a previous tenant?

50:56.818 --> 50:59.253
This person,
these, these people,

50:59.255 --> 51:02.289
they're a threat to my safety
and to the safety of my baby.

51:02.291 --> 51:04.791
Do you honestly think
we would ever let anything

51:04.793 --> 51:06.562
happen to you or the baby?

51:06.896 --> 51:09.762
Sharon, we are staying here
to make sure you're safe

51:09.764 --> 51:11.264
until Roman gets back.

51:11.266 --> 51:12.435
Safe from what?

51:15.137 --> 51:20.076
At this point, Sharon,
safe from yourself.

51:21.344 --> 51:24.481
We're done here.

52:36.485 --> 52:39.787

52:50.532 --> 52:52.568

- I'm so sorry.

52:53.768 --> 52:54.904
Hi.

52:55.371 --> 52:57.972
I was just doing some
work on my car here.

52:57.974 --> 52:59.943
I can see that.

53:00.443 --> 53:03.811
What can I do for you, Ms. Tate?
I mean Ms. Polanski. I mean...

53:03.813 --> 53:05.782
Oh, oh, please
just call me Sharon.

53:06.248 --> 53:07.416
Sharon.

53:07.882 --> 53:09.950
Oh, I meant to tell you
I changed the code

53:09.952 --> 53:12.455
on the gate this morning,
just to be on the safe side.

53:12.887 --> 53:13.922
Thank you, Steven.

53:14.990 --> 53:17.927
They were right, you're a handy
guy to have around.

53:18.327 --> 53:19.229
Ah.

53:20.429 --> 53:22.295
Do you think you might
be able to help me

53:22.297 --> 53:23.899
figure out one more thing?

53:29.038 --> 53:31.474
Right this way.

53:33.809 --> 53:35.912
- Oh. Watch your head.
- Okay.

53:38.547 --> 53:40.516
Oh. Sorry.

53:43.351 --> 53:44.420
Sorry.

53:54.829 --> 53:55.831
Thank you.

54:07.409 --> 54:09.545
Huh, you're really
into gadgets, aren't you?

54:10.445 --> 54:12.780
I've always loved
taking things apart

54:12.782 --> 54:14.251
and putting them back together.

54:14.817 --> 54:17.721
I guess I enjoy figuring
out how stuff works.

54:18.653 --> 54:21.722
Keep it up and you may become
a world famous inventor one day.

54:21.724 --> 54:23.456
- What, me?
- Yeah.

54:23.458 --> 54:24.360
Nah.

54:25.427 --> 54:28.461
I'm just a kid from El Monte
who works part time

54:28.463 --> 54:31.735
in a stereo store to save up
enough money for college.

54:34.070 --> 54:36.840
And I'm just a girl from Dallas
who's...

54:37.472 --> 54:39.873
military dad moved the family
every few years

54:39.875 --> 54:41.644
and never had any friends.

54:42.711 --> 54:44.547
Yeah, but look what you became,

54:45.815 --> 54:47.880
a world famous movie star.

54:47.882 --> 54:50.818
Hardly world famous.

54:50.820 --> 54:52.322
Well, you are to me.

54:55.523 --> 54:57.359
What about you, Steven?
Do you have someone?

54:59.094 --> 55:00.663
Special in your life?

55:04.032 --> 55:05.367
Not really.

55:06.735 --> 55:08.904
I don't see much
of anyone lately.

55:11.039 --> 55:13.842
I left home sort of suddenly
and...

55:15.077 --> 55:17.947
well, I don't...
talk to my family these days.

55:21.117 --> 55:24.550
You know, it's never too late
to tell the people

55:24.552 --> 55:26.056
you care about how you feel.

55:27.655 --> 55:30.559
I'd like to visit them
before I move on.

55:31.460 --> 55:34.664
Even just once.
To say goodbye.

55:36.465 --> 55:37.634
You should do that.

55:44.706 --> 55:48.075
So, this is the tape
you say started up by itself

55:48.077 --> 55:49.809
in the middle of the night?

55:49.811 --> 55:53.682
I honestly can't explain it.
I know I sound completely crazy.

55:55.451 --> 55:58.387
Well, things always seem crazy
if you don't ask questions.

56:08.630 --> 56:12.566
<i>♪ I'm your kind
Oh, your kind ♪</i>

56:12.568 --> 56:16.702
<i>♪ I can see ♪</i>

56:22.577 --> 56:23.846
Interesting.

56:27.583 --> 56:30.119
- What is it?
- I think it's an encode.

56:30.518 --> 56:31.754
What does that mean?

56:32.454 --> 56:35.557
This tape,
it contains subliminal messages.

56:35.891 --> 56:37.758
It's a technique
called back-masking.

56:37.760 --> 56:38.995
Here, listen again.

56:42.931 --> 56:44.898
<i>♪ I love you, pretty girl ♪</i>

56:44.900 --> 56:46.769
But, when I play it
in reverse...

56:48.471 --> 56:52.238
<i>Helter Skelter,
Helter Skelter.</i>

56:52.240 --> 56:54.744
<i>Helter Skelter.</i>

56:56.545 --> 56:59.148
- That's clever.
- What's it saying?

56:59.581 --> 57:00.750
Helter Skelter.

57:01.217 --> 57:02.818
You know,
like the Beatles' song?

57:04.786 --> 57:07.854
It sounds like some
kind of chant or mantra,

57:07.856 --> 57:10.192
almost like the foretelling
of a prophecy.

57:11.659 --> 57:13.128
All I can say
is that someone

57:13.795 --> 57:16.031
went to a lot of trouble
to make this thing.

57:17.032 --> 57:18.798
Why can the words
only be heard

57:18.800 --> 57:20.166
when it's played backwards?

57:20.168 --> 57:22.101
It's intended to be subliminal,

57:22.103 --> 57:24.540
audible only
on an unconscious level.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.907
It's mostly used in advertising
to convince people

57:26.909 --> 57:28.675
to buy things
that they don't need.

57:28.677 --> 57:32.649
It's used all over the media...
radio, TV, movies, music...

57:34.148 --> 57:35.652
to spread messages.

57:35.918 --> 57:37.620
What kind of messages?

57:39.188 --> 57:40.789
I guess all kinds.

57:42.257 --> 57:45.027
Even Satanic messages.

57:47.996 --> 57:49.531
Satanic.

57:51.199 --> 57:54.536
Personally, I think
it's all part of a plot,

57:54.969 --> 57:56.202
created by the government

57:56.204 --> 57:58.204
to turn us all into conformists,
to keep us

57:58.206 --> 58:00.740
from questioning what's really
going on with the man,

58:00.742 --> 58:02.675
From thinking for ourselves.
Think about it,

58:02.677 --> 58:05.144
if they keep us in the dark,
they control everything.

58:05.146 --> 58:08.682
We become a society of mindless
consumerist robots left

58:08.684 --> 58:11.217
to roam the wastelands of their
artificially-constructed

58:11.219 --> 58:12.621
purgatory.

58:20.563 --> 58:21.564
Hello?

58:25.099 --> 58:26.869
Yes she is,
one moment please.

58:28.103 --> 58:29.137
It's for you.

58:34.610 --> 58:35.711
Hello?

58:42.885 --> 58:44.587
What do you want from me?

58:53.027 --> 58:55.797
Ms. Tate?
Sharon, are, are you okay?

58:58.000 --> 58:59.902
Did you recognize the voice
on the phone?

59:00.603 --> 59:01.704
No, ma'am.

59:04.606 --> 59:05.608
It was him.

59:06.041 --> 59:07.076
Who?

59:07.342 --> 59:08.844
It's that man, Charlie.

59:10.311 --> 59:11.914
What did he say?

59:13.248 --> 59:15.018
He said we're all going to die.

01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:46.373
<i>Sharon, you in there?</i>

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:50.646
<i>Sharon? Sharon?</i>

01:00:51.146 --> 01:00:53.783
<i>Honey, honey,
we just want to talk to you.</i>

01:01:05.893 --> 01:01:06.895
Hello?

01:01:09.731 --> 01:01:11.900
Roman.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.271
Oh, my God, I've been trying
and trying to reach you.

01:01:16.771 --> 01:01:19.840
I've been so scared, I've had
the most terrible nightmares

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:20.977
since I've been here.

01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:23.409
Take me out of here,
I don't care where,

01:01:23.411 --> 01:01:26.715
I'll go anywhere, I just wanna
go somewhere far away from here.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.686
<i>Sharon, let us in.</i>

01:01:30.985 --> 01:01:33.422
<i>Sharon,
please, open the door.</i>

01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:36.358
Roman, are you still there?

01:01:39.527 --> 01:01:41.363
<i>Sharon,
are you in there?</i>

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:46.034
<i>Sharon, we just
want to talk to you.</i>

01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:51.239
<i>Please just,
just talk to us.</i>

01:01:57.311 --> 01:01:59.414
Roman, I need you
to listen to me.

01:02:00.382 --> 01:02:03.416
Wojciech and Gibby keep telling
me I'm imagining everything,

01:02:03.418 --> 01:02:06.019
but something terrible
is going to happen

01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:07.490
if we don't leave this house.

01:02:11.226 --> 01:02:12.862
What is wrong with you?

01:02:13.795 --> 01:02:15.795
Roman, you are not
listening to me.

01:02:15.797 --> 01:02:17.933
Haven't you heard a single
word that I've said?

01:02:19.134 --> 01:02:21.367
<i>Sharon please,
just let us in.</i>

01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:24.873
<i>Sharon, we just want
to talk, let us in, please.</i>

01:02:28.943 --> 01:02:30.779
I'm just about to take a bath,

01:02:31.246 --> 01:02:32.481
I'll be out soon.

01:02:33.481 --> 01:02:36.085
It's them, Roman.

01:02:36.485 --> 01:02:38.217
They're involved in the plot,

01:02:38.219 --> 01:02:40.119
they're not
who you think they are.

01:02:40.121 --> 01:02:43.289
Roman, listen to me,
there's this man named Charlie,

01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:46.027
and I think he's the leader
of some kind of a cult.

01:02:46.994 --> 01:02:50.095
And I think he has followers,
people that do whatever

01:02:50.097 --> 01:02:51.597
he wants them to do.

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:53.999
And they have been
coming to the house at all hours

01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:56.773
and leaving tapes and...

01:02:56.972 --> 01:02:59.072
...there's messages
inside of their music,

01:02:59.074 --> 01:03:01.177
Satanic messages from...

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:04.147
And they're coming here
to take the baby.

01:03:06.882 --> 01:03:07.916
Roman?

01:03:14.188 --> 01:03:15.223
Roman?

01:03:25.132 --> 01:03:28.270
<i>Helter Skelter,
Helter Skelter.</i>

01:03:28.637 --> 01:03:30.907
<i>Helter Skelter...</i>

01:04:23.525 --> 01:04:24.594
Steven?

01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:27.163
Steven, come, help me.

01:04:35.003 --> 01:04:36.972
No, no!

01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:38.608
No!

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:40.608
Sharon, Sharon,
Sharon, you're all right.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:42.541
You're okay. You're safe,
it's all over.

01:04:42.543 --> 01:04:44.079
It's just a bad dream.

01:04:45.112 --> 01:04:48.280
No, no, no.
It was not a dream,

01:04:48.282 --> 01:04:51.483
I saw you, and you...
you were dead.

01:04:51.485 --> 01:04:53.619
It's okay, you've
been sleeping, all right?

01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:55.621
You didn't wanna go
back over to the house,

01:04:55.623 --> 01:04:57.691
so I let you rest here
for a few hours.

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:58.995
Few hours?

01:04:59.193 --> 01:05:01.061
- Stay right there.
- No. Steven,

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:04.229
no, you have to listen to me.
We're in danger, real danger.

01:05:04.231 --> 01:05:07.233
The baby.

01:05:07.235 --> 01:05:08.969
- Wha...
- Oh, the baby.

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:11.170
Wait, the baby?
Wait, it's, it's coming?

01:05:11.172 --> 01:05:13.373
I don't know, but I need you
to go get help.

01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:15.541
Go outside
and take your car, okay?

01:05:15.543 --> 01:05:17.476
I don't know how far
I can make it.

01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:18.947
I'm going to call for help.

01:05:19.246 --> 01:05:23.184
Steven, there's no time,
I need you to go right now.

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:25.751
What?

01:05:25.753 --> 01:05:27.188
The line is dead.

01:05:37.532 --> 01:05:39.068
What's going on?

01:05:40.434 --> 01:05:42.534
Steven, I need you
to listen to me.

01:05:42.536 --> 01:05:44.406
Go outside and get the police.

01:05:44.672 --> 01:05:47.275
- But what about the baby?
- Steven, go get your car!

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:22.744
Fuck.

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.590
Steven, no!

I heard gunshots.

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:39.245
- There's no time, Gibby.

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:40.846

- Jay. Oh, my God!
- Sharon, I was

01:10:48.409 --> 01:10:50.043
at the restaurant.
Where did you... Whoa.

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:51.311
- Oh, God!
- You okay?

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:52.577
What's wrong?
You're shaking.

01:10:52.579 --> 01:10:53.879
Hey, come here.

01:10:53.881 --> 01:10:55.016
Sharon, what's wrong?

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:57.453
Jay!

01:10:58.353 --> 01:11:00.855
Who the fuck are you?
What do you want?

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:03.726
I'm the devil.

01:11:04.658 --> 01:11:06.461
And I'm here to do
the devil's business.

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:11.399
Get in there.

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:43.763
Please, please,
you can kill me,

01:11:43.765 --> 01:11:45.865
but can you just let
me have my baby?

01:11:45.867 --> 01:11:48.433
I just want to live long
enough to have my baby.

01:11:48.435 --> 01:11:50.102
Bitch, you might as well
face it right now,

01:11:50.104 --> 01:11:51.470
you're going to die.

01:11:51.472 --> 01:11:53.442
And I don't feel a thing
behind it.

01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:20.665
Please, please, please,
she's pregnant,

01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:23.371
please don't kill her.
Pease. No!

01:12:27.742 --> 01:12:29.945
Please don't kill her,
please don't kill her.

01:12:30.545 --> 01:12:32.648
Well, I guess we'll start
with you then, pretty boy.

01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:38.418
Take anything you
want in the house, please,

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.954
please don't kill me,
please don't kill me.

01:12:46.961 --> 01:12:48.564
[gunshot

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.836
Take me, you piece of shit.

01:13:00.475 --> 01:13:02.711
Do it.
Come on, kill me.

01:13:05.979 --> 01:13:06.981
Kill me.

01:13:10.752 --> 01:13:16.692
Well, well, well,
the pregnant little starlet...

01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:19.994
has got some fight in her.

01:13:21.628 --> 01:13:23.399
I know who you are.

01:13:25.065 --> 01:13:26.635
Do you know who I am?

01:13:31.773 --> 01:13:33.976
You're the motherfucking devil.

01:14:12.613 --> 01:14:13.881
Jay, look out!

01:14:28.595 --> 01:14:29.697
Come on.

01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:34.069
Come on.

01:14:40.073 --> 01:14:41.143
Come in.

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.946
Steven, Will had a ham radio.

01:14:44.145 --> 01:14:46.215
Maybe he left it
in here somewhere.

01:14:48.815 --> 01:14:50.818
- I can put it back together.
- Okay.

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.402
Where is Wojciech?

01:17:57.404 --> 01:17:59.840
Hurry up, more
of them might be coming.

01:18:01.408 --> 01:18:04.442
Just make it
work, okay? Please.

01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:09.815
- Come on, come on.
- Someone, anyone,

01:18:09.817 --> 01:18:12.017
come in, this is an emergency.

01:18:12.019 --> 01:18:13.419
<i>What's your 20?</i>

01:18:16.023 --> 01:18:17.859
Oh, my God.

01:18:19.025 --> 01:18:21.162
<i>Anyone there, come in.</i>

01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:33.108
Sharon, I am so sorry.

01:18:34.408 --> 01:18:36.111
I don't want to die.

01:18:36.911 --> 01:18:38.447
We're not going to die, okay?

01:18:39.447 --> 01:18:42.784
You are not going to die,
you are not going to die.

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:47.321
<i>Hello?
Hello? Come in.</i>

01:19:12.046 --> 01:19:14.312
<i>Ten-38,
ambulance remotely needed.</i>

01:19:14.314 --> 01:19:16.917
<i>Awaiting confirmation
on caller's 20.</i>

01:19:19.252 --> 01:19:22.323
<i>Ten-nine, you were stepped off,
repeat the message, come back.</i>

01:19:26.127 --> 01:19:28.230
<i>Anyone there?
Come in.</i>

01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:34.502
<i>Twenty four-nine
for a radio check.</i>

01:19:39.105 --> 01:19:40.541
<i>I can't help you
if you don't answer.</i>

01:19:44.011 --> 01:19:45.447
<i>Do you need an ambulance?</i>

01:19:49.984 --> 01:19:52.120
<i>Hello? Come in.</i>

01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:07.001
<i>Break one-nine
for a radio check.</i>

01:20:10.003 --> 01:20:12.403
<i>Ten-38, ambulance
remotely needed.</i>

01:20:12.405 --> 01:20:14.542
<i>Awaiting confirmation
on caller's 20.</i>

01:20:18.145 --> 01:20:20.079
<i>Ten-nine,
you were stepped on,</i>

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:21.483
<i>repeat the message,
come back.</i>

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.322
<i>Anyone there?</i>

01:20:29.155 --> 01:20:30.192
<i>Come in.</i>

01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:36.030
<i>Break one-nine
for a radio check.</i>

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:39.234
Hey, asshole.

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:30.484
Fuck you!

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:38.560
- Sharon.
- Sharon.

01:21:49.636 --> 01:21:50.639
Wojciech!

01:21:58.311 --> 01:22:00.414
Here we go. Come on.

01:23:30.837 --> 01:23:32.470
<i>Do you think
it's possible</i>

01:23:32.472 --> 01:23:34.442
<i>to alter the course
of our fate,</i>

01:23:35.141 --> 01:23:37.278
<i>or is our story just our book,</i>

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:39.646
<i>written before we
were even born?</i>

01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:51.757
<i>I think there's infinite
choices, infinite realities.</i>

01:23:51.759 --> 01:23:53.625
<i>We're probably living out
different versions</i>

01:23:53.627 --> 01:23:56.431
<i>of our own story for...
who knows?</i>

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:59.801
<i>Probably forever,
at least until we get it right.</i>

01:24:45.546 --> 01:24:47.515
<i>I would like
to be a fairy princess.</i>

01:24:49.283 --> 01:24:52.183
<i>A little golden doll
with gossamer wings,</i>

01:24:52.185 --> 01:24:55.219
<i>in a voile dress,
adorned with bright,</i>

01:24:55.221 --> 01:24:56.291
<i>shiny things.</i>

01:24:57.492 --> 01:25:01.496
<i>I see that as something
totally pure and beautiful.</i>

01:25:02.762 --> 01:25:05.567
<i>I think my whole life
has been decided by fate.</i>

01:25:06.199 --> 01:25:08.769
<i>I've never planned anything
that's ever happened to me.</i>

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:26.181
I guess you could say
I live in a fairytale world,

01:26:26.646 --> 01:26:29.283
looking at everything
through rose-colored glasses.

01:26:30.583 --> 01:26:32.451
I probably always will.
