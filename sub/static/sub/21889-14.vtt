Good morning.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.648
Good morning.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.068
And good grief!

01:09.360 --> 01:12.072
What happened to your brand-new
back-to-school jeans?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.073
I ripped them up.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.408
Now they're my back-to-cool jeans.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.538
Hey, you know the rule.
No hats at the table.

01:20.830 --> 01:21.748
Not a problem.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.128
OK. New rule.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.922
No blue hair at the table.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.094
You're 15-years-old.
Why are you having a mid-life crisis?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.889
Hey, Marge Simpson called,

01:37.972 --> 01:39.599
she wants her hair back.

01:39.682 --> 01:40.642
[Stephanie laughs]

01:40.725 --> 01:43.478
Hey, did you buy that hair
at a Katy Perry garage sale?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.063
Nice!

01:46.231 --> 01:48.858
Look,
I don't expect you guys to understand.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.985
I'm Gen Y, and you're Gen X.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.029
I'm like the iPhone 8,
and you're all like,

01:53.113 --> 01:55.865
"Will you accept a collect call
from Grandpa?"

01:57.283 --> 01:59.577
But school picture day is Monday.

01:59.661 --> 02:03.373
And I already spent $79.95
on two eight-by-tens,

02:03.456 --> 02:05.875
three five-by-sevens,
eight wallet-sized...

02:06.751 --> 02:08.670
A mouse pad, a coffee mug.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.006
I think they're taking advantage
of how much I love my children.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.386
Although I do love my Max oven mitt.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.226
Oh, that's for me.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.729
By the way, I think I'm old enough
to choose my own hairstyle.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.648
Besides, you color yours.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.026
I only color my hair
to make it look more natural.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.780
And to cover up some gray.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.117
I don't think
you wanna start a conversation

02:39.200 --> 02:41.202
about what's real and what's fake.

02:46.541 --> 02:51.254
Mom, I promise, no matter how intense
the peer pressure gets,

02:51.337 --> 02:53.673
I will never touch this beautiful salad.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.261
Looks like you finally have a teenager.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.929
He had to rebel at some point.

03:00.763 --> 03:04.017
Yeah, but why that hair,
and those clothes?

03:06.978 --> 03:09.063
[all] Oh!

03:10.315 --> 03:11.608
Hey, why are we "oh"-ing?

03:11.691 --> 03:13.318
Just because she's got purple--

03:13.902 --> 03:15.486
Oh!

03:17.071 --> 03:18.197
Hey, what's for breakfast?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.157
[scoffs]

03:19.240 --> 03:20.199
Bacon and eggs.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.743
You guys are so white bread,

03:21.826 --> 03:23.453
you're eating white bread.

03:25.413 --> 03:30.043
Why do I have a feeling
that you had something to do with this?

03:30.126 --> 03:30.960
[Rocki sighs]

03:31.044 --> 03:31.961
Look, Deej--

03:32.545 --> 03:33.379
Deej?

03:34.464 --> 03:37.050
All I did was tell Jackson
that he's being raised

03:37.133 --> 03:39.719
in an artificial world
of sugar-coated sweetness.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.055
That is so not true.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.443
That was terrible timing.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.157
This mama's boy is gonna be eaten alive
if he doesn't grow some McNuggets.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.994
Oh, you don't have to worry
about my McNuggets.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.832
See ya later. We're going to the Wharf
to make fun of the tourists.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.709
Don't forget to take out the trash.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.003
I'll get to it when I get to it.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.758
This is all Gia's fault.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.969
She was a bad influence on you,

04:21.052 --> 04:23.888
and now her daughter is a bad influence
on my son.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.517
I'm calling her up.
I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.686
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.687
Why not?

04:31.521 --> 04:32.730
She blocked you.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.359
I'll text her.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.487
It's a big day today, ladies.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.991
Steph and I are interviewing
some potential surrogate mothers.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.617
Oh, I told you,

04:44.701 --> 04:47.287
I would be more than happy
to carry your baby.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.746
Deej, we went over this.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.999
You have a full-time job, and three kids.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.043
Plus, you had a very difficult birth
with Tommy.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.004
I had a difficult delivery, too.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.047
I gave birth to Ramona in a rental car.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.429
Yes, Kimmy, we all saw you on the news.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.223
Well, don't worry everyone,

05:07.307 --> 05:09.684
I've got some great candidates
lined up for us.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.352
Wow.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.563
You are taking this so seriously.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.731
You bet I am.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.276
And I've developed a pretty thorough
vetting process.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.319
Hmm.

05:19.944 --> 05:23.740
"Do you or do you not believe
in Sasquatch?"

05:25.867 --> 05:27.368
There's only one right answer.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.334
Kimberlina!

05:34.417 --> 05:37.086
I am back from my race in Monte Carlo.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.004
Hi, baby.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.965
How did you do?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.091
Well, get this.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.926
I was so far in the lead,

05:44.010 --> 05:46.179
I stopped at Mickey D's for a Big Mac.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.558
While I was I taking a picture
with Mayor McCheese,

05:50.641 --> 05:53.061
the Hamburglar stole my race car.

05:55.063 --> 05:55.897
Are you kidding me?

05:55.980 --> 05:58.191
Yes, of course.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.612
Mom, Papa, I've got the test results.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.989
Whatever it is,
please tell me it's negative.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.704
Well, remember the DNA testing
we did for my family tree project?

06:12.288 --> 06:13.122
Nope.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.250
I had you both spit in cups,

06:16.334 --> 06:18.294
and then swab the insides of your cheeks.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.254
You have to be more specific.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.382
You were watching  The Voice.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.343
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, yeah. That night.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.428
Well, here's our family tree.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.057
And my teacher said our parents
should help us learn about our ancestors.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.018
Of course.
Your mother and I are happy to help.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.437
But I already know
I'm 100% Argentinian.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.108
And I come from a long line
of proud British pickpockets.

06:42.110 --> 06:42.944
In fact,

06:43.027 --> 06:45.113
legend has it that over 400 years ago,

06:45.196 --> 06:47.532
a Gibbler stole the very first fanny pack.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.745
Well, Mom, I traced your roots back
six generations,

06:52.829 --> 06:56.207
and it turns out
you are actually part French.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.127
Sweet fromage!

07:01.754 --> 07:04.382
No wonder I always order the French toast
at Denny's.

07:07.093 --> 07:10.179
And Papa, it turns out
your great-great-great-grandfather

07:10.263 --> 07:11.305
on your mother's side

07:11.389 --> 07:15.476
was Herschel Horowitz,
the herring king of Hayvenhurst Heights.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.644
[Fernando gasps]

07:16.936 --> 07:18.521
I'm part Jewish?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.607
[speaking Yiddish]

07:26.404 --> 07:27.822
[doorbell rings]

07:28.322 --> 07:30.241
OK, Jimmy, here's our first candidate.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.453
This could be the woman
who's gonna carry our child.

07:34.745 --> 07:35.580
Hi.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.084
Or somebody else's.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.085
I'm Mindy,

07:41.169 --> 07:45.089
and there is no greater joy on Earth
than to carry and birth a baby.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.675
Yeah, aren't you kind of busy
doing that right now?

07:48.926 --> 07:51.345
I am. But the Millers
are behind on their payments.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.015
If they back out,
I can make you a good deal on this one.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.560
I like her.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.898
And that's how you trick the parole board

08:01.981 --> 08:04.233
into thinking you're not crazy.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.695
It's another great candidate.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.449
I got a question.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.117
And it's make or break.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.536
Sasquatch. Real or fake?

08:16.871 --> 08:19.499
Take your time.
There's a lot riding on this.

08:20.958 --> 08:21.918
Fake!

08:25.671 --> 08:28.591
Take your time.
There's a lot riding on this.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.265
Uh, thank you so much, but we're--

08:36.349 --> 08:38.893
We're not interested
in hiring a chain smoker.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.313
[growls] I can quit anytime.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.858
I do it every morning.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.696
-Thanks.
-[coughing]

08:50.780 --> 08:52.114
Try the patch!

08:55.284 --> 08:57.119
That was a terrible group of people!

08:57.828 --> 09:00.248
We're gonna have to find
a different surrogate agency.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.916
Oh, an agency.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.376
That's a great idea.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.254
I just put an ad on Craigslist

09:06.337 --> 09:09.215
under "fun-loving couple
seeking open-minded woman."

09:10.341 --> 09:11.551

09:12.134 --> 09:13.511
It's always open.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.974
Hi, Gia.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.517
Hi.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.061
Who is smoking in my house?

09:22.144 --> 09:23.646
[Jimmy coughs]

09:23.729 --> 09:25.690
Oh. Of course, Gia.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.316
It wasn't me this time.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.695
So Steph said you wanted to blame me
for something?

09:30.778 --> 09:32.238
Yes, I do.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.156
Your juvenile delinquent daughter

09:34.240 --> 09:37.034
is corrupting my sweet, angelic son.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.704
Do you ever think that
maybe your sweet, angelic son

09:39.787 --> 09:42.832
is corrupting my juvenile
delinquent daughter?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.545
I caught her brushing her teeth
and doing her homework.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.840
That's on you.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.843
What's up, girl?

09:54.468 --> 09:57.346
We just wasted half a day
interviewing baby surrogates.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.223
[scoffs] Why didn't you come to me?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.350
I'd love to throw my womb in the ring.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.188
Uh, no, that's a terrible idea.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.274
Hold on, Deej.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.736
I mean, it would be great to have somebody
that I know and trust.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.071
I mean, Gia and I go back over 20 years.

10:14.155 --> 10:14.989
Yeah.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.617
We've stood by each other
through good times and bad.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.537
I would love to see Steph
realize her dream of motherhood.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.290
That is so sweet.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.291
Wow.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.502
Have I been wrong about you
all these years?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.047
I'd be happy to donate my services.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.341
Just out of curiosity,

10:33.424 --> 10:35.468
who's footing the bill for this in vitro?

10:36.218 --> 10:39.430
My entire family is chipping in
to cover everything.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.974
Oh. In that case, forget charity.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.059
I'm full price.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.395
No, I was right all along.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.025
And so before we get into
my benefits package,

10:51.108 --> 10:54.278
how much drinking is too much
when you're pregnant?

10:56.530 --> 10:57.823
Any drinking.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.825
So just wine coolers?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.203
Yeah, you know--

11:02.286 --> 11:03.663
I'm gonna stop you...

11:03.746 --> 11:05.539
I don't think this is a good fit for me.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.291
Aw, dang it.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.876
That's so disappointing.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.545
You bet it is.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.881
I can get pregnant
walking through a Chili's.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.259
And I have.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.850
I pop out to the farmer's market,

11:25.393 --> 11:26.352
and I come home...

11:26.435 --> 11:27.728
to this?

11:33.818 --> 11:35.027
Ew!

11:38.322 --> 11:39.615
Trash ball!

11:39.698 --> 11:40.533
He shoots...

11:42.493 --> 11:43.869

11:43.953 --> 11:45.913
You dirty animals!

11:49.208 --> 11:50.376
Mama's boy.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.669
And proud of it.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.422
Max, what is the--

11:54.505 --> 11:57.174
Oh, my landfill.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.137
Well, I hate to leave a good time.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.222
That's why this is so easy.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.432
Adios,  Deej.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.060
Make Jackson clean up this mess!

12:08.144 --> 12:09.770
