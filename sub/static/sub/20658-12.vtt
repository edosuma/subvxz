00:06.240 --> 00:07.541
Here's a challenge.

00:07.541 --> 00:08.776
I want you to believe

00:08.776 --> 00:10.711
what I'm about to tell you.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.080
Not just hear it, not just

00:12.080 --> 00:15.249
understand it, but believe it.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.250
It's a fact that you already

00:16.250 --> 00:17.285
know to be true,

00:17.285 --> 00:18.386
but have never been able

00:18.386 --> 00:20.254
to fully accept.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.622
And it's this:

00:21.622 --> 00:24.458
You are going to die.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.227
You, the person listening to me

00:26.227 --> 00:29.097
right now, are going to die.

00:30.598 --> 00:31.899
It's difficult even to imagine,

00:31.899 --> 00:33.234
isn't it?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.735
Take a moment and try to picture

00:34.735 --> 00:38.239
what it's like to not exist.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.640
You can't do it.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.475
You're imagining darkness.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.776
Black.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.478
But there will be no black.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.813
There will be no color,

00:45.813 --> 00:46.980
because there will be no you

00:46.980 --> 00:48.582
to perceive it.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.418
And your mind recoils

00:50.418 --> 00:51.919
from that idea.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.754
It's simply unable to conceive

00:53.754 --> 00:55.756
of its own nonexistence,

00:55.756 --> 00:57.591
and so it concludes

00:57.591 --> 00:59.160
that it's impossible,

00:59.160 --> 01:01.095
that you'll live forever.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.830
But you won't.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.665
All things end.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.667
All motion slows.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.503
All heat becomes cold.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.672
Life is an eddy in that current

01:11.672 --> 01:12.773
of entropy,

01:12.773 --> 01:14.508
a brief chemical reaction that

01:14.508 --> 01:16.510
lights up the darkness and then,

01:16.510 --> 01:19.280
its fuel spent, dissipates back

01:19.280 --> 01:22.450
to nothing, just like you will.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.618
Your body is a marvelous and

01:24.618 --> 01:26.454
intricate machine built out

01:26.454 --> 01:28.021
of millions of interconnected

01:28.021 --> 01:29.790
fragile systems,

01:29.790 --> 01:31.525
and as you age, each begins

01:31.525 --> 01:33.161
to slowly, but surely,

01:33.161 --> 01:35.696
deteriorate and break down.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.531
When one fails, a doctor may be

01:37.531 --> 01:39.032
able to repair it, but at some

01:39.032 --> 01:40.534
point, there will be too many

01:40.534 --> 01:41.702
interlocking failures to

01:41.702 --> 01:43.671
proceed, and like a cascade of

01:43.671 --> 01:45.173
dominos, your joints,

01:45.173 --> 01:47.308
your eyes, your heart,

01:47.308 --> 01:49.177
your lungs, your memory,

01:49.177 --> 01:52.045
your entire body will fail.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.014
It will happen.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.149
And while it's difficult to hear

01:55.149 --> 01:57.318
this truth, it is essential that

01:57.318 --> 01:58.186
you accept it,

01:58.186 --> 01:59.720
because every second that goes

01:59.720 --> 02:01.389
by in which you don't is a

02:01.389 --> 02:02.990
second of your precious

02:02.990 --> 02:04.525
and finite life

02:04.525 --> 02:06.660
that you risk wasting.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.196
So I'm going to say it once

02:08.196 --> 02:10.731
more, and this time, try as hard

02:10.731 --> 02:13.667
as you can to believe me.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.870
You, yes, you, will die,

02:17.905 --> 02:18.839
and there is nothing

02:18.839 --> 02:21.509
you can do to stop it.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.177
How's that?

02:23.177 --> 02:24.678
What the (bleep)?

02:24.678 --> 02:25.513
Too much?

02:25.513 --> 02:26.214
Yeah, that's a lot

02:26.214 --> 02:27.080
for a first date.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.081
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't

02:28.081 --> 02:29.016
open with it.

02:29.016 --> 02:29.717
Also, what's with

02:29.717 --> 02:30.518
the hourglass?

02:30.518 --> 02:31.252
Do you just carry that thing

02:31.252 --> 02:32.019
around for dramatic effect?

02:32.019 --> 02:32.853
Yeah.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.021
And I use it to boil eggs.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.756
A little heavy-handed, I know.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.024
Oh, she's here.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.559
So I think that Haylie might

02:38.559 --> 02:39.927
actually maybe for some reason

02:39.927 --> 02:42.095
like you, so ix-nay

02:42.095 --> 02:42.763
on the death stuff.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.764
Just ask her if she's, like,

02:43.764 --> 02:45.433
a cat person or a dog person.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.400
I'm a turtle person.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.435
Just keep it light.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.269
You know, tell the truth.

02:48.269 --> 02:48.936
The awful truth!

02:48.936 --> 02:49.937
Ugh, no. No.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.739
Just-- Don't be yourself.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.040
Literally be anyone else

02:53.040 --> 02:54.242
but yourself.

02:54.242 --> 02:54.908
I can do that.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.710
Good luck.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.511
Smile.

03:05.453 --> 03:06.220
Hi.

03:06.220 --> 03:06.954
There you are.

03:06.954 --> 03:07.888
Sorry I'm late.

03:07.888 --> 03:08.889
I hate when people are late.

03:08.889 --> 03:09.623
Me too.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.724
I was the first to arrive at

03:10.724 --> 03:13.727
both parties I've attended.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.595
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.063
It's funny.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.097
Joke.

03:20.634 --> 03:21.635
I can't believe I'm

03:21.635 --> 03:23.571
saying this, but I think

03:23.571 --> 03:24.605
they might actually--

03:27.475 --> 03:29.643
Holy crow.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.778
Well, I did tell her.

03:42.923 --> 03:43.657
I'm afraid we don't know

03:43.657 --> 03:44.492
if Emily will ever

03:44.492 --> 03:46.460
come out of this coma.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.295
I'm sorry.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.270
Oh, my God.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.004
Am I gonna die?

03:57.004 --> 03:57.671
Oh, of course,

03:57.671 --> 03:58.772
we all will, one day.

03:58.772 --> 03:59.773
Even when I'm in a coma,

03:59.773 --> 04:00.508
I can't escape you.

04:00.508 --> 04:03.677
I mean right now.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.813
Honestly, I don't know.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.515
You...

04:07.515 --> 04:10.017
But I have so much I want to do.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.018
I'm getting married in three

04:11.018 --> 04:12.520
months and I want to raise

04:12.520 --> 04:15.022
a family, and one day, I really

04:15.022 --> 04:17.691
want to meet UFC Bantamweight

04:17.691 --> 04:18.692
champion Ronda Rousey.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.027
I don't wanna die!

04:20.027 --> 04:21.194
But you will.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.496
Death is inevitable,

04:22.496 --> 04:23.797
and it's vitally important

04:23.797 --> 04:25.533
that you accept that.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.967
No, mm-mm.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.168
Not me, not this girl.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.837
I'm gonna wake up from this coma

04:29.837 --> 04:31.372
and go back to my life, and then

04:31.372 --> 04:32.873
by the time I'm old,

04:32.873 --> 04:34.007
we'll have cured death

04:34.007 --> 04:35.309
and people will be immortal!

04:35.309 --> 04:36.877
Google's working on it.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.313
That is a complete fantasy.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.714
People have been trying to cure

04:40.714 --> 04:42.215
death for millennia,

04:42.215 --> 04:43.484
and it's never worked.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.156
In 210 B.C., the first emperor

04:49.156 --> 04:50.991
of China dosed himself with what

04:50.991 --> 04:51.825
he thought were

04:51.825 --> 04:54.227
"immortality pills."

04:54.227 --> 04:56.063
They were mercury pills.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.998
I died real quick.

04:57.998 --> 04:58.832
And in the ninth century,

04:58.832 --> 05:00.000
an alchemist who was trying

05:00.000 --> 05:02.035
to brew an "immortality" potion

05:02.035 --> 05:04.171
made a wee bit of an error.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.238
This flammable powder will

05:05.238 --> 05:08.409
save millions of lives.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.242
He actually invented

05:09.242 --> 05:10.511
gunpowder.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.745
Thanks to his quest for eternal

05:11.745 --> 05:13.180
life, millions have been

05:13.180 --> 05:14.582
shot dead.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.716
Well, we're way closer

05:15.716 --> 05:17.050
to immortality now.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.251
What about chryonics?

05:18.251 --> 05:20.187
I can freeze my body so it can

05:20.187 --> 05:21.589
be revived later.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.923
That's medically doubtful,

05:22.923 --> 05:24.257
and it assumes that the company

05:24.257 --> 05:25.526
that freezes you is gonna be

05:25.526 --> 05:26.694
around that long.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.861
In one famous case, the

05:27.861 --> 05:29.430
Chryonics Society of California

05:29.430 --> 05:31.064
ran out of money and couldn't

05:31.064 --> 05:32.933
keep their customers frozen.

05:32.933 --> 05:33.767
No...

05:33.767 --> 05:35.068
The bodies began to thaw

05:35.068 --> 05:36.036
and decompose.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.204
No, no, no.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.105
Then some of the bodies went

05:38.105 --> 05:39.607
missing, and to this day, their

05:39.607 --> 05:40.774
families still don't know

05:40.774 --> 05:41.875
where they went.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.777
No, no, no, no, no!

05:43.777 --> 05:44.612
Uh, hey, Pete, do we still

05:44.612 --> 05:45.379
have that extra large

05:45.379 --> 05:46.547
beer cooler?

05:46.547 --> 05:48.716
Okay, well, I follow a bunch

05:48.716 --> 05:50.384
of futurists on Twitter.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.219
I have a very eclectic feed.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.554
And they believe that one day,

05:53.554 --> 05:54.955
we'll be able to upload our

05:54.955 --> 05:57.290
brains onto computers.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.626
That's ridiculous.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.727
First of all, your brain

05:59.727 --> 06:00.728
is a physical organ.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.595
That's like saying you could

06:01.595 --> 06:02.463
upload your liver

06:02.463 --> 06:03.797
onto a computer.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.466
And secondly, even if you could,

06:05.466 --> 06:06.467
your consciousness wouldn't

06:06.467 --> 06:08.436
teleport onto the computer.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.803
You just have created a pretty

06:09.803 --> 06:10.638
accurate A.I.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.305
simulation of yourself.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.108
Ah, eternal life.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.244
Ah, eternal life.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.412
Wait.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.080
I'm--I'm still dying.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.081
I'm still here.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.483
It doesn't work that way.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.251
I'm basically Siri.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.419
This piece of crap!

06:25.419 --> 06:26.487
We've never been able to stop

06:26.487 --> 06:27.788
death, and we never will.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.125
Okay, fine.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.463
You win, I will die, one day.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.997
But...

06:36.997 --> 06:38.566
Why does it have to be today?

06:48.676 --> 06:50.143
I'm sorry.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.445
Let me try to cheer you up.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.846
You know, I always go shopping

06:52.846 --> 06:54.014
when I'm down.

06:54.014 --> 06:54.815
I guess that sounds

06:54.815 --> 06:57.184
like a good distraction.

06:57.184 --> 07:01.021
Shopping for caskets.

07:01.021 --> 07:01.855
This would never happen

07:01.855 --> 07:02.756
to Ronda Rousey.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.162
What do you think

07:09.162 --> 07:10.363
his last words were?

07:10.363 --> 07:13.133
Probably "whoops," or "ouch."

07:13.133 --> 07:14.802
The concept of "last words" is

07:14.802 --> 07:16.804
as silly as the rest of this.

07:16.804 --> 07:17.505
Wait, are you trying

07:17.505 --> 07:18.839
to ruin funerals?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.307
This is how people grieve.

07:20.307 --> 07:20.974
Yeah.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.510
Which is why it's so tragic that

07:22.510 --> 07:24.177
the American funeral industry

07:24.177 --> 07:25.546
needlessly exploits

07:25.546 --> 07:26.980
that grief for profit.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.649
Case in point, the expensive and

07:28.649 --> 07:30.684
useless process of embalming,

07:30.684 --> 07:31.652
which was popularized

07:31.652 --> 07:33.320
during the Civil War.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.688
After Lincoln was assassinated,

07:34.688 --> 07:35.689
the government paraded his

07:35.689 --> 07:37.324
corpse around the country in

07:37.324 --> 07:38.325
order to showcase the hero's

07:38.325 --> 07:40.494
sacrifice, but that's not what

07:40.494 --> 07:41.895
the people took away from it.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.864
Oh, my gosh, Abe has been

07:43.864 --> 07:45.332
dead for weeks and he still

07:45.332 --> 07:47.167
looks fly as hell.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.401
Honestly, anyone who is

07:48.401 --> 07:49.503
anyone gets pumped

07:49.503 --> 07:50.838
full of chemicals.

07:50.838 --> 07:51.705
But for those of us whose

07:51.705 --> 07:53.173
bodies aren't going on tour,

07:53.173 --> 07:55.375
embalming is totally pointless.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.176
Why would you need to be

07:56.176 --> 07:57.511
preserved right before they

07:57.511 --> 07:59.046
bury you in the dirt?

07:59.046 --> 07:59.880
Isn't the whole point

07:59.880 --> 08:01.014
to decompose?

08:01.014 --> 08:01.849
Excuse me.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.350
Embalming gives dignity

08:03.350 --> 08:04.351
to the deceased.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.719
Yes, it's respectful.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.854
Respectful?

08:06.854 --> 08:08.689
What do you think embalming is?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.090
It's like a spa day.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.424
For a dead body.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.726
Exactly, don't correct her.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.094
Embalming is the least

08:14.094 --> 08:14.928
respectful thing you

08:14.928 --> 08:16.063
could do to a body.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.198
First, the jaw is wired shut.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.233
The eyes are sealed with glue,

08:20.233 --> 08:21.735
then the internal organs are

08:21.735 --> 08:23.270
punctured and drained through

08:23.270 --> 08:24.572
a hole in the abdomen.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.706
After that, they pump the

08:25.706 --> 08:28.742
arteries full of formaldehyde,

08:28.742 --> 08:30.243
and stuff the internal cavities

08:30.243 --> 08:31.545
full of cotton.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.245
Okay, stop!

08:32.245 --> 08:33.914
Enough, enough, enough.

08:33.914 --> 08:34.715
I don't want to puke in front

08:34.715 --> 08:35.448
of a dead body.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.216
Fair enough.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.918
But the entire process is a

08:37.918 --> 08:40.220
pointless waste of time, because

08:40.220 --> 08:41.221
even though funeral directors

08:41.221 --> 08:42.289
tell their vulnerable,

08:42.289 --> 08:43.456
grieving customers...

08:43.456 --> 08:44.925
Embalming is necessary if you

08:44.925 --> 08:46.459
want an open casket.

08:46.459 --> 08:47.127
And...

08:47.127 --> 08:48.295
It keeps the body

08:48.295 --> 08:49.262
safe and sanitary.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.798
None of it is true.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.299
Refrigeration is cheaper and

08:52.299 --> 08:53.967
just as effective as embalming.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.402
The World Health Organization

08:55.402 --> 08:56.737
states that dead bodies pose

08:56.737 --> 08:58.071
nearly no health risks

08:58.071 --> 08:58.972
to the living.

08:58.972 --> 08:59.640
It's completely safe

08:59.640 --> 09:00.307
to touch them.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.443
Here, watch!

09:03.443 --> 09:04.311
Adam!

09:04.311 --> 09:05.112
That's weird.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.814
Yeah, but it's still safe,

09:06.814 --> 09:07.781
which is ironic, because

09:07.781 --> 09:09.750
formaldehyde isn't safe.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.484
It's a carcinogen.

09:11.484 --> 09:12.653
Why do we still do this?

09:12.653 --> 09:13.754
Just one reason.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.122
These guys charge a graveload

09:15.122 --> 09:16.924
of money to do it.

09:16.924 --> 09:17.758
Let's not talk about

09:17.758 --> 09:18.759
the bodies so much.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.761
Let's talk about how beautiful

09:20.761 --> 09:22.596
this casket is.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.964
Yeah, it better be beautiful.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.332
It's one of the most expensive

09:25.332 --> 09:27.434
things you'll ever buy.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.802
Funeral homes can charge upwards

09:28.802 --> 09:30.938
of ten grand for a coffin.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.641
The lid is titanium steel,

09:33.641 --> 09:35.809
it's lined with mink fur and it

09:35.809 --> 09:37.611
comes with free WiFi.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.012
It's what Pop-Pop

09:39.012 --> 09:41.448
would have wanted.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.115
Do you have

09:42.115 --> 09:44.351
any cheaper options?

09:44.351 --> 09:45.786
Well, for those who don't

09:45.786 --> 09:47.655
love their Pop-Pop, we do have

09:47.655 --> 09:49.122
this "My Loved One Deserved

09:49.122 --> 09:50.624
to Die" model.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.992
You will need to decide quickly,

09:51.992 --> 09:55.863
the funeral is tomorrow.

09:55.863 --> 09:56.664
Pop-Pop would have

09:56.664 --> 09:58.331
wanted the WiFi.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.500
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.334
Hell, you might as well be

10:01.334 --> 10:03.704
buried with $10,000 in cash.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.472
♪ Money money

10:05.472 --> 10:06.339
Well, it's nice to support

10:06.339 --> 10:07.540
local businesses.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.976
Actually, a lot of "local"

10:08.976 --> 10:10.177
funeral homes are owned by a

10:10.177 --> 10:12.680
mega corporation named SCI that

10:12.680 --> 10:13.981
buys up mom and pop shops,

10:13.981 --> 10:15.148
but keeps the old name,

10:15.148 --> 10:16.349
so no one notices.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.151
They really are a cash cow.

10:18.151 --> 10:18.986
They can't make

10:18.986 --> 10:20.153
that much money.

10:20.153 --> 10:20.821
Well, maybe you'd believe

10:20.821 --> 10:22.690
SCI treasurer Aaron Foley,

10:22.690 --> 10:23.691
who told investors,

10:23.691 --> 10:25.558
we really are a cash cow.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.695
♪ It's all about the money

10:27.695 --> 10:28.996
But what's the alternative?

10:28.996 --> 10:29.897
Throw all the dead people in a

10:29.897 --> 10:30.998
pile and leave them there and

10:30.998 --> 10:32.700
charge admission to see it?

10:32.700 --> 10:33.867
Not exactly.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.836
You could choose cremation,

10:35.836 --> 10:37.838
but another, maybe even better

10:37.838 --> 10:40.340
option, is natural burial.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.008
Ahh!

10:41.008 --> 10:42.342
Who is this? Are we related?

10:42.342 --> 10:43.576
Are you my ghost?

10:43.576 --> 10:44.745
No, Emily, this is

10:44.745 --> 10:45.879
Caitlin Doughty, she's a

10:45.879 --> 10:47.180
licensed mortician and an

10:47.180 --> 10:48.849
advocate for natural burial.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.183
In natural burial, we dig a

10:50.183 --> 10:51.518
hole in the ground and place

10:51.518 --> 10:53.687
the body in in just a shroud,

10:53.687 --> 10:55.555
no chemical embalming,

10:55.555 --> 10:57.224
no heavy metal casket,

10:57.224 --> 10:59.426
no concrete-lined vault.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.560
Is this safe?

11:00.560 --> 11:01.929
It's completely safe.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.196
Humans have been burying their

11:03.196 --> 11:04.865
bodies like this for tens of

11:04.865 --> 11:06.399
thousands of years.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.234
But when the funeral

11:07.234 --> 11:08.435
industry started,

11:08.435 --> 11:10.704
it really took the power away

11:10.704 --> 11:12.205
from the grieving families.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.406
I think that my job as

11:13.406 --> 11:14.875
a mortician should just be to

11:14.875 --> 11:17.277
facilitate you taking the power

11:17.277 --> 11:18.746
around the time of death.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.213
You can be involved as much or

11:20.213 --> 11:21.749
as little as you want to be,

11:21.749 --> 11:23.550
but it can be a really intimate

11:23.550 --> 11:25.585
and beautiful way to say goodbye

11:25.585 --> 11:28.221
to someone you love.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.257
This is really nice.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.892
Thank you, Caitlin.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.093
You know, I think this

11:33.093 --> 11:35.095
is what I want.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.229
That's great.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.731
But you won't get it.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.733
See?

11:39.733 --> 11:40.768
Because you didn't confront your

11:40.768 --> 11:42.269
mortality and decide how you'd

11:42.269 --> 11:43.403
want to be buried while you were

11:43.403 --> 11:45.105
still alive, Murph will probably

11:45.105 --> 11:46.639
bankrupt himself getting you

11:46.639 --> 11:48.909
a regular funeral.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.277
Aw, man.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.278
In fact, because you didn't

11:51.278 --> 11:52.746
plan ahead, everything about

11:52.746 --> 11:54.281
your death will suck, and I'll

11:54.281 --> 11:55.916
explain why right after this.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.284
I know I'm literally dying,

11:57.284 --> 11:58.085
but you are the worst

11:58.085 --> 11:59.086
part of my day.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.095
He's so thoughtful.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.163
Death is so hard.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.331
Yeah, it is.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.665
That's why it's so important

12:12.665 --> 12:14.434
that you accept that one day,

12:14.434 --> 12:16.136
you will grow old and die.

12:16.136 --> 12:16.804
If you don't,

12:16.804 --> 12:17.771
you'll end up making terrible

12:17.771 --> 12:19.172
medical decisions.

12:19.172 --> 12:19.973
I thought your show was

12:19.973 --> 12:20.841
supposed to be a comedy.

12:20.841 --> 12:21.608
Well, the line between comedy

12:21.608 --> 12:22.442
and drama has blurred

12:22.442 --> 12:23.343
in recent decades.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.277
You know, if you look at--

12:24.277 --> 12:24.945
Get on with it.

12:24.945 --> 12:25.745
Right-o!

12:27.180 --> 12:28.348
Hey, Adam.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.182
I wondered when you guys

12:29.182 --> 12:30.350
were gonna show up.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.151
Emily.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.452
this is Dr. Bud Hammes.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.353
He's the director of

12:33.353 --> 12:34.454
Respecting Choices for

12:34.454 --> 12:35.956
Gundersen Health System.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.690
Basically, he helps doctors have

12:37.690 --> 12:38.792
end-of-life conversations

12:38.792 --> 12:40.027
with their patients.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.962
I'm glad you guys are here.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.163
I have a story to tell you.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.497
Oh, this is my favorite book!

12:44.497 --> 12:45.532
It's about how I get prostate

12:45.532 --> 12:46.967
cancer and die.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.301
You know, one in seven American

12:48.301 --> 12:49.202
men gets prostate cancer.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.037
Prostate cancer.

12:50.037 --> 12:50.838
I know, you tell me every time

12:50.838 --> 12:51.504
we hang out.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.205
Did you write a book

12:52.205 --> 12:53.140
about your own death?

12:53.140 --> 12:54.207
It helps make the point.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.375
Would you read it to us, Bud?

12:55.375 --> 12:56.143
I'd be delighted

12:56.143 --> 12:57.845
to read it to you.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.146
So here's the problem.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.647
Patients and their doctors most

13:00.647 --> 13:02.482
often don't have conversations

13:02.482 --> 13:04.051
about when the burdens of

13:04.051 --> 13:05.819
treatment would be so high,

13:05.819 --> 13:06.653
they wouldn't outweigh

13:06.653 --> 13:08.055
the benefits of treatment.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.356
If you can't face having an

13:09.356 --> 13:10.991
honest conversation about death

13:10.991 --> 13:12.826
with your doctor, you can end up

13:12.826 --> 13:14.494
chasing unnecessary treatments

13:14.494 --> 13:15.896
that do very little to prolong

13:15.896 --> 13:17.664
your life and just make your

13:17.664 --> 13:20.200
final days really uncomfortable.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.568
Mr. Conover,

13:21.568 --> 13:22.735
the cancer has spread.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.904
I think it's time we discuss--

13:23.904 --> 13:25.338
I don't want to hear it!

13:25.338 --> 13:26.573
I'm a fighter, damn it!

13:26.573 --> 13:27.875
Give me every dangerous

13:27.875 --> 13:29.676
chemical you got!

13:29.676 --> 13:30.543
Where are the drugs?

13:30.543 --> 13:31.544
Give it to me!

13:31.544 --> 13:33.180
I'm gonna live forever!

13:33.180 --> 13:35.248
Ha ha!

13:35.248 --> 13:36.016
Because I couldn't accept the

13:36.016 --> 13:37.684
truth, I died in a hospital,

13:37.684 --> 13:39.552
barely conscious, in a whole lot

13:39.552 --> 13:41.088
of pain, when I could have

13:41.088 --> 13:42.422
chosen to die at home,

13:42.422 --> 13:43.924
surrounded by my family.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.025
Adam, I think I'm telling

13:45.025 --> 13:46.026
this story.

13:46.026 --> 13:46.894
I'm sorry.

13:46.894 --> 13:47.928
I know it by heart.

13:47.928 --> 13:48.761
So Emily,

13:48.761 --> 13:50.030
now is the time to make these

13:50.030 --> 13:51.098
plans for future

13:51.098 --> 13:52.265
healthcare decisions.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.266
It's a time to talk with your

13:53.266 --> 13:54.767
family about your values,

13:54.767 --> 13:56.369
your preferences and your goals,

13:56.369 --> 13:57.770
so they don't end up guessing

13:57.770 --> 13:59.272
when they make your decisions.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.540
I mean, I wouldn't mind that.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.541
Murph's my fiancé.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.876
He would know what I want.

14:02.876 --> 14:03.776
That's an understandable

14:03.776 --> 14:04.577
point of view.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.279
A lot of people think that.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.215
But the research is very clear.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.282
When families don't have these

14:09.282 --> 14:10.717
conversations, the family

14:10.717 --> 14:12.219
members are no better than

14:12.219 --> 14:13.286
strangers at making

14:13.286 --> 14:14.287
these decisions.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.555
They end up guessing.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.756
And that can be really,

14:16.756 --> 14:18.758
really hard on them.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.127
Dad wouldn't want to suffer.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.228
Pull the damn plug.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.095
I'd feel to guilty

14:22.095 --> 14:23.130
to let him die.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.631
Keep him hooked up forever!

14:24.631 --> 14:25.565
I think we should eat him.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.300
That'd be the most efficient.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.301
Sometimes the conflicts are

14:28.301 --> 14:30.303
so severe, I don't know that

14:30.303 --> 14:31.404
the family will ever talk

14:31.404 --> 14:32.772
to each other again.

14:32.772 --> 14:33.640
That is such a hard

14:33.640 --> 14:34.741
conversation to have.

14:34.741 --> 14:35.775
I mean, I don't--

14:35.775 --> 14:36.443
I don't know where

14:36.443 --> 14:37.444
I would begin.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.146
So Emily, there are three

14:39.146 --> 14:39.812
simple questions everyone

14:39.812 --> 14:41.148
should consider.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.916
The first is, if you couldn't

14:42.916 --> 14:43.984
make your own decisions,

14:43.984 --> 14:44.817
who would make decisions

14:44.817 --> 14:45.986
on your behalf?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.487
Kids, if I were to ever

14:47.487 --> 14:49.256
become so sick that I couldn't

14:49.256 --> 14:50.823
decide on my own care,

14:50.823 --> 14:52.092
I would want your mother

14:52.092 --> 14:53.626
Haylie to decide.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.761
You married Haylie?

14:54.761 --> 14:55.495
It's my storybook, I can

14:55.495 --> 14:56.763
write it however I want.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.431
The second is, if you suffer

14:58.431 --> 15:00.267
a serious and permanent brain

15:00.267 --> 15:01.668
injury, how bad would it

15:01.668 --> 15:03.470
have to be for you to change

15:03.470 --> 15:04.837
your goals of care?

15:04.837 --> 15:06.139
Well, I wouldn't want to be

15:06.139 --> 15:08.175
kept alive if I was brain dead,

15:08.175 --> 15:09.977
which I guess right now,

15:09.977 --> 15:11.278
I might be.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.779
The third question is, do you

15:12.779 --> 15:14.681
have any strongly-held values or

15:14.681 --> 15:17.017
beliefs that would influence how

15:17.017 --> 15:18.851
medical decisions might be made?

15:18.851 --> 15:22.455
Um...

15:22.455 --> 15:23.656
I don't know, honestly, these

15:23.656 --> 15:25.292
are really tough questions

15:25.292 --> 15:26.994
to field right now.

15:26.994 --> 15:27.995
Well, you're right, Emily,

15:27.995 --> 15:30.497
they are hard to answer.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.464
That's why in La Crosse,

15:31.464 --> 15:33.133
Wisconsin, we decided to

15:33.133 --> 15:34.867
approach all of our patients and

15:34.867 --> 15:36.369
offer them the opportunity to do

15:36.369 --> 15:38.171
this planning, that way families

15:38.171 --> 15:39.306
have the confidence that

15:39.306 --> 15:41.174
they made the right decisions.

15:47.814 --> 15:48.881
Did you ever have a

15:48.881 --> 15:49.716
conversation like that

15:49.716 --> 15:51.018
with Murph?

15:51.018 --> 15:52.185
No, I never thought about it

15:52.185 --> 15:55.355
before today.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.624
Well, the decision is yours.

16:00.060 --> 16:03.863
I don't know what to do.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.233
I don't know what she wants.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.001
I hate this.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.669
Death will always be a

16:09.669 --> 16:11.738
terrible loss, but if you can

16:11.738 --> 16:13.673
accept its inevitability,

16:13.673 --> 16:14.907
it makes the whole process

16:14.907 --> 16:16.476
a lot easier.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.018
I know.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.919
I know what I want.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.090
I know what I want here.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.692
I'm going to die.

16:32.692 --> 16:33.760
I didn't want it to be now,

16:33.760 --> 16:36.729
but... it's going to be.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.699
You sure?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.701
Yeah, I don't--

16:41.701 --> 16:42.702
I don't want to be unconscious

16:42.702 --> 16:44.104
on a hospital bed forever, and

16:44.104 --> 16:46.039
if I leave the decision up to

16:46.039 --> 16:47.940
Murph, you know, no matter what

16:47.940 --> 16:49.376
he chooses, he'll never feel

16:49.376 --> 16:50.543
like he made the right choice.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.548
I-- I don't know, Em.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.584
It's okay.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.553
I'm okay.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.688
This is right.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.626
It's been fun, Adam.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.228
Yeah?

17:08.228 --> 17:09.396
More than I like to admit.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.371
Okay.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.044
Okay.

17:29.082 --> 17:29.916
It looks like Emily

17:29.916 --> 17:32.652
decided for you.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.754
I'm sorry.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.490
Oh, God.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.126
Tonight I was gonna surprise her

17:39.126 --> 17:40.327
and take her to a Ronda Rousey

17:40.327 --> 17:41.628
meet-and-greet.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.495
Wait, what?

17:42.495 --> 17:45.165
Ronda Rousey meet-and-greet?

17:45.165 --> 17:45.965
Oh, my God.

17:45.965 --> 17:46.833
She's awake.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.270
Emily, you're alive!

17:50.270 --> 17:51.271
I love you so much.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.339
I love you.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.007
I love you, too.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.143
I came as soon as I could.

17:56.143 --> 17:56.809
Oh, Haylie.

17:56.809 --> 17:57.477
Oh, yeah, you're awake--

17:57.477 --> 17:58.445
Whoops!

18:01.181 --> 18:02.315
Holy crow.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.619
She dead.

18:14.694 --> 18:15.862
We are here today to

18:15.862 --> 18:19.031
celebrate the life of Haylie.

18:19.031 --> 18:19.866
"Thou shalt show me

18:19.866 --> 18:21.701
"the path to life.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.170
"In thy presence is the fullness

18:23.170 --> 18:26.173
"of love, in thy mercy,

18:26.173 --> 18:27.039
by all of God's"--

18:27.039 --> 18:29.209
Funerals are very wasteful!

18:29.209 --> 18:30.310
No, I'm not sad.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.144
I'm spreading the truth

18:31.144 --> 18:32.044
to the masses.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.813
That coffin's too expensive!

18:33.813 --> 18:34.881
The markup's insane,

18:34.881 --> 18:35.648
it's a scam.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.016
Adam, stop.

18:37.016 --> 18:37.850
Okay?

18:37.850 --> 18:39.652
It's okay to grieve.

18:39.652 --> 18:43.223
I'm sad, too.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.491
There's got to be something

18:44.491 --> 18:45.958
I can learn to make this better.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.631
I don't think there is.

18:58.405 --> 19:02.074
I'm scared to die.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.510
Well, what about all that

19:03.510 --> 19:06.078
accepting death stuff?

19:06.078 --> 19:07.514
It doesn't make it

19:07.514 --> 19:09.081
less frightening.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.017
It doesn't--

19:11.017 --> 19:13.520
It doesn't make any sense.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.855
What is it for?

19:15.855 --> 19:17.524
What do you do?

19:17.524 --> 19:20.693
What are you supposed to do

19:20.693 --> 19:22.161
when a person dies?

19:27.367 --> 19:30.870
I don't know.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.873
But...

19:33.873 --> 19:35.208
It's okay not to know.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.416
It's okay not to know.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.385
Yeah, it's okay not to know.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.387
Sometimes you don't know,

19:49.055 --> 19:51.891
and you may never know,

19:51.891 --> 19:53.025
and that's okay.

19:59.232 --> 19:59.899
Come on, let's get you

19:59.899 --> 20:00.567
out of here.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.868
Let's go for a walk.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.278
Oh, thanks.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.146
It's this dumb cane.

20:14.146 --> 20:14.814
Do you want to ruin

20:14.814 --> 20:16.082
something for me?

20:16.082 --> 20:17.817
Maybe that would cheer you up.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.319
Oh, no.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.487
I mean, I believe a lot of

20:20.487 --> 20:21.754
really dumb stuff, you know,

20:21.754 --> 20:22.989
like pop rocks and Coke?

20:22.989 --> 20:23.990
That's dangerous.

20:23.990 --> 20:24.957
You know, and the moon landing?

20:24.957 --> 20:25.658
Never happened.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.327
And also the Illuminati, I--

20:27.327 --> 20:28.160
I'm really not in the mood

20:28.160 --> 20:29.929
right now.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.464
Sorry.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.299
Okay.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.005
Hey, how's--

20:39.005 --> 20:40.673
How's wedding planning going?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.442
It's pretty good.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.511
It's very busy.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.513
I'm sure.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.147
I'm really, really looking

20:48.147 --> 20:49.649
forward to it.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.350
Yeah.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.286
You and Murph are the best.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.455
Aww.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.289
Yeah.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.290
You know, a lot of wedding

20:57.290 --> 20:57.957
traditions are, like,

20:57.957 --> 20:59.025
really arbitrary.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.293
Yeah?

21:00.293 --> 21:01.628
I'm sure.

21:01.628 --> 21:02.662
Oh, yeah.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.696
Oh, I even read this

21:03.696 --> 21:05.365
article about it...

21:05.365 --> 21:06.333
