WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:03.134
YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED TO YOU?

00:03.134 --> 00:04.475
I CAN'T THINK
OF A THING.

00:04.475 --> 00:06.607
I CAN THINK
OF SO MANY THINGS.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.410
YOU WERE SUCH A HO-BAG,
THAT I-I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE

00:09.410 --> 00:12.283
I'M 50 FEET AWAY FROM SOME
YOUNG HOOCHIE YOU SLEPT WITH.

00:12.283 --> 00:13.584
(chuckles)
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:13.584 --> 00:15.486
HEY, GIRLS! IT'S GRAYSON!

00:15.486 --> 00:19.019
GRAY-GRAY?! (gasps)

00:19.019 --> 00:21.122
OH... MY... GOD!

00:21.122 --> 00:25.096
I HARDLY RECOGNIZED YOU
OUTSIDE THE CLUB. OH.
(dance music playing)

00:25.096 --> 00:27.758
(imitates dance beat)

00:27.758 --> 00:29.100
(imitates dance beat)

00:29.100 --> 00:31.332
BREAK IT DOWN.
DANCING ON THE BAR.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.403
WHOOP, WHOOP.
YEAH.

00:32.403 --> 00:34.605
IN THE CLUB, YEAH, BABY,
TAKE IT DOWN--

00:34.605 --> 00:36.467
WHOOP--WHAT ARE WE DOING?
(music stops)

00:36.467 --> 00:38.309
HOLLY, THIS IS MY FIANCEE...

00:38.309 --> 00:40.671
JULES AND HER SCARY,
JUDGMENTAL FRIEND.

00:40.671 --> 00:42.373
HI. (giggles)
BLECH.

00:42.373 --> 00:46.117
OH, HE AND I USED TO HOOK UP,
LIKE, REALLY HARD.

00:46.117 --> 00:47.178
AWESOME.

00:47.178 --> 00:49.049
WE SHOULD
REALLY CATCH UP.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.050
YEAH.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.583
OH, HEY, DID I LEAVE
ANYTHING AT YOUR PLACE?

00:52.583 --> 00:53.754
YOUR DIGNITY.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.056
(giggles)

00:56.056 --> 00:59.160
ANY TIME GIRLS LEFT STUFF,
I JUST PUT IT IN HERE.

00:59.160 --> 01:04.395
WAIT. YOU HAVE A LOST-AND-FOUND
BANG BOX? THAT'S DISGUSTING.

01:04.395 --> 01:06.097
DIBS ON THESE SUNGLASSES.

01:06.097 --> 01:10.141
YEAH, I AM TOTALLY TAKING THESE
SCRUNCHIES AND THIS BROWNIE PAN.

01:10.141 --> 01:13.574
YEAH, SHE GAVE ME TREATS...
AND MADE ME BROWNIES.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.576
THERE ARE A LOT OF CROSSES,

01:15.576 --> 01:19.079
CONSIDERING ALL THESE GIRLS
GAVE IT UP FOR A DUMB BARTENDER.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.212
(pills rattle)
THESE ARE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS.

01:21.212 --> 01:23.354
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET THOSE BACK
TO HER BEFORE SHE GETS ALL...

01:23.354 --> 01:26.717
"AAH! GONNA GO AROUND
WITH A KNI--"

01:26.717 --> 01:29.120
WHAT THE...

01:29.120 --> 01:30.361
THIS IS MY BRA.

01:30.361 --> 01:33.864
OH, RIGHT. I ALWAYS FORGET
THAT WE HOOKED UP.

01:33.864 --> 01:37.228
LOOK, IT WAS NOT THE WORST SEX
OF MY LIFE, BUT--
SWEETIE?

01:37.228 --> 01:38.769
SAVE THAT
FOR MY WEDDING TOAST.

01:38.769 --> 01:41.172
DULY NOTED.

01:41.172 --> 01:43.234
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:46.237 --> 01:49.140
LOOK, I DON'T MIND HELPING YOU
PUT YOUR WET SUIT ON EVERY DAY.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.881
WELL... OKAY, I DO.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.144
I MEAN, IT'S WEIRD YOU DON'T
WEAR ANYTHING UNDERNEATH.

01:53.144 --> 01:55.115
THAT'S HOW I ROLL, DUDE.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.888
PLEASE DON'T GO SURFING.
I MISS OUR MORNING TIME.

01:57.888 --> 02:00.691
BABY, YOU SHOULD STAY HOME
AND RIDE THESE WAVES.

02:00.691 --> 02:02.293
YOU SLEEP WITH THAT.

02:02.293 --> 02:03.894
I SLEEP NEAR THAT.

02:03.894 --> 02:06.527
I SURF 'CAUSE I NEED
SOME ALONE TIME.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.560
THIS LITTLE CUL-DE-SAC CREW
DOES EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.761
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

02:10.761 --> 02:11.832
YESTERDAY, I TOOK A SHOWER

02:11.832 --> 02:14.134
WITHOUT TALKING TO YOU
ON SPEAKERPHONE.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.135
AND?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.136
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.308
MEH.

02:17.308 --> 02:19.640
OH, GRAY-GRAY,
WE SHOULD HEAD OUT SOON.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.173
WE ARE NOT MARRIED, BUT WE HAVE
TO GO TO MARRIAGE COUNSELING?

02:22.173 --> 02:23.514
WHY?

02:23.514 --> 02:26.517
'CAUSE I LOVE ME SOME THERAPY.
I'M GOOD AT IT.

02:26.517 --> 02:28.279
PAYING OTHER PEOPLE
TO LISTEN TO YOUR PROBLEMS?

02:28.279 --> 02:29.320
UH-HUH.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.821
YOU KNOW, MARRIAGE COUNSELING
BEFORE MARRIAGE

02:30.821 --> 02:32.683
DOES FEEL
A LITTLE BACKWARDS.

02:32.683 --> 02:34.785
I DON'T WANT TO ENTER INTO THIS
WITH ANY BAGGAGE.

02:34.785 --> 02:37.258
MY LAST MARRIAGE
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.730
I WAS PREGNANT,
I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL,

02:39.730 --> 02:42.493
BOBBY WAS SLEEPING WITH
KATHY VALERO, OUR WEATHER LADY.

02:42.493 --> 02:43.734
FROM NEWS CHANNEL 7?

02:43.734 --> 02:45.536
I KNOW. HOW COOL IS THAT?

02:45.536 --> 02:47.468
(both) в™Є NEWS ON 7 в™Є

02:47.468 --> 02:49.870
(all) в™Є WE GOT THE NEWS в™Є

02:49.870 --> 02:51.242
(laughs)

02:51.242 --> 02:54.475
HE SKIPPED MY BIRTHDAY
TO GO HAVE SEX WITH HER.

02:58.209 --> 03:02.483
NO WAY! E-STREET?
LET'S HANG, GIRL.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.255
(grunts)

03:05.616 --> 03:07.358
ELLIE?

03:07.358 --> 03:10.461
I WANT TO START OUR MARRIAGE
BAGGAGE-FREE,

03:10.461 --> 03:12.793
BUT, UH, THIS ONE HERE'S
GOT A BANG BOX.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.824
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK--

03:13.824 --> 03:15.496
LOOK, THAT PART OF MY LIFE
IS OVER.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.528
CAN WE JUST
PLEASE MOVE ON?

03:17.528 --> 03:20.200
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
WE'RE READY TO MOVE ON.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.302
OKAY. WE CAN MOVE ON.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.673
DID YOU JUST SIGNAL HER?

03:22.673 --> 03:24.705
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU MISS THE FIRST APPOINTMENT,

03:24.705 --> 03:26.377
YOU KNOW. PEOPLE BOND.

03:26.377 --> 03:27.878
SEEMS FAIR.

03:27.878 --> 03:31.612
SO, GRAYSON, YOU WANT KIDS,
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, JULES?

03:31.612 --> 03:35.346
WELL, I DID SAY THAT I WOULD
GO ON ANY ADVENTURE WITH HIM,

03:35.346 --> 03:36.517
BUT NOT ALL ADVENTURES

03:36.517 --> 03:38.889
ARE THINGS YOU'RE
NECESSARILY DYING TO DO.

03:38.889 --> 03:41.522
I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE,
UM, BEING KIDNAPPED--

03:41.522 --> 03:42.693
THAT'S AN ADVENTURE.

03:42.693 --> 03:44.395
EATING RAW CHICKEN.

03:44.395 --> 03:46.497
YOU DON'T GET CREDIT
FOR SAYING YOU'LL HAVE A KID

03:46.497 --> 03:49.400
IF YOU'RE GONNA CONSTANTLY
MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.231
I AGREE.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.235
BECAUSE I HAVE TO, JULES.
HE BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT.

03:55.235 --> 03:59.410
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I'M--I'M JUST--I'M SCARED.

03:59.410 --> 04:02.873
I'M TOTALLY ON BOARD
WITH YOU, OKAY?

04:02.873 --> 04:04.815
I LOVE YOU.

04:04.815 --> 04:07.378
MM.

04:07.378 --> 04:11.322
AW. YOU GUYS ARE MAKING ME
MISS MY HUSBAND. (chuckles)

04:11.322 --> 04:12.653
HE KILLED HIMSELF.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.927
SO WE GOT ANOTHER--WOW...

04:16.927 --> 04:18.789
42 MINUTES.

04:18.789 --> 04:22.463
(exhales deeply)
WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE WE GOT?

04:22.463 --> 04:25.966
I LOVE THAT YOU'RE HAVING PEOPLE
SIGN YOUR HELMET.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.267
HMM.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.941
SO... WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THE PHALLUS PALACE?

04:30.941 --> 04:33.574
(gasps) THAT WOULD BE SUCH
A GOOD NAME FOR A GAY BAR.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.347
THEN WE SHALL FIND
A NEW HOUSE NAME.

04:36.347 --> 04:38.309
I MISS HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

04:38.309 --> 04:40.811
COME ON. I DON'T HAVE
ANYONE TO FLIRT WITH.

04:40.811 --> 04:42.953
LET ME TAKE YOU OUT
TO LOUIE.

04:42.953 --> 04:44.455
IT'S MY NEW WORD FOR "LUNCH."

04:44.455 --> 04:46.587
AW, THANKS FOR THE INVITE,
BUT I THINK I'M GONNA RIDE OUT

04:46.587 --> 04:50.491
MY LAST WEEK OF HUMILIATION
HERE IN THE NUT HUT.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.523
NOPE.
YEAH, THAT'S WORSE.

04:52.523 --> 04:55.996
I'M JUST TIRED OF BEING MOCKED
EVERY TIME I GO OUTSIDE,

04:55.996 --> 04:58.068
AND OUR WEIRD NEIGHBOR
KEEPS SHOOTING

04:58.068 --> 04:59.970
THESE SUCTION CUP DARTS
AT MY HELMET.

04:59.970 --> 05:02.473
I THINK HE'S GOT, LIKE,
A CRUSH ON ME OR SOMETHING.

05:02.473 --> 05:04.735
RAIN CHECK, OKAY?

05:04.735 --> 05:06.677
YEAH, OKAY.

05:06.677 --> 05:07.878
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

05:07.878 --> 05:09.440
ALL RIGHT, GO.
(click)

05:09.440 --> 05:10.781
(scoffs)
DUDE!

05:10.781 --> 05:13.644
I DON'T ROLL THAT WAY!

05:18.389 --> 05:21.692
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU CATCH A WAVE
YET, ELLIE. WHAT GIVES?

05:21.692 --> 05:24.495
I DON'T ACTUALLY
RIDE THE WAVES.

05:24.495 --> 05:27.327
I JUST SIT HERE.
I'M A WAVE-SITTER.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.100
WELL, THAT MAKES LESS SENSE
THAN NONALCOHOLIC BEER...

05:30.100 --> 05:31.702
OR SOCCER.

05:31.702 --> 05:35.335
I LOVE IT, AND UNTIL YOU SHOWED
UP WITH YOUR FRAZZLE DAZZLE,

05:35.335 --> 05:37.037
I GOT TO BE ALONE.

05:37.037 --> 05:40.911
ONLY HARD PART IS GETTING BACK
TO SHORE, BUT I HAVE A SYSTEM.

05:40.911 --> 05:42.813
(Ellie screams)

05:47.117 --> 05:49.550
YOU WANT ME TO
TEACH YOU HOW TO SURF?

05:49.550 --> 05:51.652
YES, PLEASE.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.624
NO.

05:53.624 --> 05:55.426
WAIT.

05:55.426 --> 05:56.887
NO, YOU WAIT.

05:56.887 --> 05:59.059
GO GET IT. (chuckles)
(crunching)

05:59.059 --> 06:00.631
NOW SCRAM.
I GOT TO TALK TO GRAYSON.

06:00.631 --> 06:01.962
(clears throat)

06:01.962 --> 06:05.496
DO YOU THINK DR. METTLER
SEES US AS A GOOD COUPLE?

06:05.496 --> 06:06.397
IT'S HARD TO KNOW FOR SURE,
YOU KNOW,

06:06.397 --> 06:09.500
UNLESS WE HAD HER NOTEBOOK.
OH, WAIT.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.642
I DO.
(high-pitched voice) HA HA!

06:11.642 --> 06:14.445
YOU STOLE HER NOTEBOOK?

06:14.445 --> 06:16.547
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
SO ATTRACTED TO YOU.

06:16.547 --> 06:17.778
(both, high-pitched voices)
SOUL MATES.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.080
(normal voice)
MWAH. CHECK IT OUT.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.512
OH. HERE WE ARE.

06:21.512 --> 06:23.383
OH, YEAH, LOOK, LOOK,
SHE WROTE DOWN "NARCISSIST"

06:23.383 --> 06:25.486
BUT DOESN'T SAY
WHICH ONE OF US SHE MEANT.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.418
IT'S GOTTA BE ME.
I'M SURE IT'S ME.

06:27.418 --> 06:30.461
OH, SHE ALSO SAYS
WE'RE COMPATIBLE

06:30.461 --> 06:33.063
AND HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE.

06:33.063 --> 06:35.596
WE ARE BAGGAGE-FREE.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.068
HEY, GRAY-GRAY.
(chuckles)

06:38.068 --> 06:42.002
SO THIS IS KIND OF WHAT
I WANTED TO CATCH UP ABOUT.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.874
SHE'S YOURS. (laughs)

06:47.177 --> 06:49.880
THAT FEELS LIKE BAGGAGE.

06:58.489 --> 07:01.051
BOTH HAVE TINY EYES.

07:01.051 --> 07:03.554
IT'S A BABY.
EVERYTHING'S TINY.

07:03.554 --> 07:06.957
WE'RE SCREWED.
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

07:06.957 --> 07:09.830
OH, HEY. DO YOU GUYS
HAVE ANY WASABI ALMONDS?

07:09.830 --> 07:11.502
ACTUALLY, YES.
NO.

07:11.502 --> 07:14.565
NO SNACKS UNTIL AFTER YOU
EXPLAIN WHY YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

07:14.565 --> 07:16.567
OHH, BUT I'M SO HUNGRY.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.939
COME ON, MAN. SHE'S STARVING.
WHY AM I FIGHTING FOR HER?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.541
I DON'T KNOW.

07:20.541 --> 07:24.515
WHEN WE THREW DOWN, YOU WERE,
LIKE, ALL ANGRY AND DARK,

07:24.515 --> 07:27.548
WHICH WAS SO FREAKIN' HOT...

07:27.548 --> 07:29.820
(baby voice) BUT IT WAS ALSO
A LITTLE BIT SCARY, WASN'T IT?

07:29.820 --> 07:31.482
(giggles)
(door opens)

07:31.482 --> 07:35.526
(normal voice) NOW YOU JUST
SEEM SO HAPPY AND STABLE.
(door closes)

07:35.526 --> 07:38.228
HOLLY? WHAT? NO WAY.

07:38.228 --> 07:39.459
YOU KNOW HER?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.562
YEAH, SINCE,
LIKE, GRADE SCHOOL.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.564
MWAH.
(baby voice)
OH, HERE'S MY BABY GIRL.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.595
YOU KNOW HER?

07:44.595 --> 07:46.236
TAMPA'S MY GODDAUGHTER.

07:46.236 --> 07:47.738
MY DAUGHTER'S NAME IS TAMPA?

07:47.738 --> 07:49.540
YOU'RE THE FATHER?

07:49.540 --> 07:52.573
I THINK THIS MIGHT BE
MY FAVORITE DAY EVER.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.244
REALLY?
LET ME HAVE THIS.

07:54.244 --> 07:58.809
SO CAN YOU GUYS TAKE TAMPA
TONIGHT? 'CAUSE I NEED TO DANCE.

07:58.809 --> 08:03.113
(laughs) SERIOUSLY,
I DON'T WANT TO. I NEED TO.

08:03.113 --> 08:05.015
I'M ASSUMING THAT
WHEN YOU SLEPT WITH MY FIANCE,

08:05.015 --> 08:07.618
YOU ALSO SLEPT
WITH OTHER GUYS AS WELL?

08:07.618 --> 08:11.622
HELLS YEAH, I DID.
(laughs)

08:11.622 --> 08:13.564
OKAY, WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE A PATERNITY TEST,

08:13.564 --> 08:16.667
YOU KNOW, JUST FOR FUN.

08:16.667 --> 08:20.100
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
GRAYSON KNOCKED THAT GIRL UP.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.072
I DON'T THINK THAT BABY'S HIS.

08:22.072 --> 08:24.074
HAVE YOU SEEN
HOW TIGHT HIS JEANS ARE?

08:24.074 --> 08:27.608
HE'S DEFINITELY FIRING BLANKS.
I'LL GET MORE WAX.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.640
BREAK IT DOWN, SISTER.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.784
BOBBY. TEACHING ELLIE ANYTHING
IS A BAD IDEA.

08:33.784 --> 08:36.617
I TRIED SHOWING HER
HOW TO TEXT A PICTURE.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.988
SHE CELL-PHONE-WHIPPED ME.

08:37.988 --> 08:39.750
I STILL DON'T HAVE
PERIPHERAL VISION.

08:41.692 --> 08:45.556
WOW.
HE SHOULD NOT BE DRIVING.

08:45.556 --> 08:46.727
SHE'S THE UNTEACHABLE WOMAN.

08:46.727 --> 08:50.300
OH, I'LL BE FINE,
LITTLE BUDDY.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.834
YOUR REFRIGERATOR IS FILLED WITH
NOTHING BUT BEER AND CHURROS.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.666
YEAH, I JUST WENT SHOPPING.

08:55.666 --> 08:58.609
ALL RIGHT, PAL. TIME TO LEAVE.
SURF SCHOOL'S A-STARTIN'.

08:58.609 --> 09:00.871
WELL, THIS SUCKS.
NO ONE WANTS ME AROUND TODAY.

09:00.871 --> 09:01.872
TODAY?

09:01.872 --> 09:04.615
HOW COME ANGIE GETS TO STAY?

09:04.615 --> 09:06.917
OH, I OCCASIONALLY
LET HIM TOUCH MY BOOBS.

09:06.917 --> 09:07.918
WELL, I'LL LET YOU DO THAT.

09:07.918 --> 09:08.949
WOW.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.151
HIT THE BRICKS.

09:13.283 --> 09:15.085
OH, COOL.

09:15.085 --> 09:18.328
YOU'RE READING "HAMLET."

09:18.328 --> 09:19.830
YOU STILL HATE BOOKS, HUH?

09:19.830 --> 09:21.231
YEAH.

09:21.231 --> 09:25.636
I ALSO DECIDED THAT SINCE YOU
WON'T GO OUT TO LOUIE WITH ME,

09:25.636 --> 09:27.898
I'M JUST GONNA COME TO YOU.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.971
HEY, BRO?

09:30.971 --> 09:32.703
THERE IS NO MUSIC
IN THE WORLD

09:32.703 --> 09:34.775
THAT WILL MATCH
WHAT YOUR BODY IS DOING.

09:34.775 --> 09:35.976
I'M LEARNING
HOW TO STEP DANCE

09:35.976 --> 09:37.748
SINCE I'M JOINING
OMEGA BETA THETA.

09:37.748 --> 09:40.150
WHY ARE YOU JOINING
THE BLACK FRAT?

09:40.150 --> 09:42.783
SIG HAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED
HIMSELF BLACK-ADJACENT.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.686
WELL, I COULD
TEACH YOU HOW TO STEP.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.618
YEAH, I HAVE WATCHED
"STOMP THE YARD,"

09:47.618 --> 09:49.790
LIKE, ONE MILLION TIMES.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.962
THERE'S A SCENE 72 MINUTES IN

09:51.962 --> 09:55.696
WHERE IT'S JUST ALL OF THESE
RIPPED, HOT, BLACK DANCERS,

09:55.696 --> 09:58.168
AND THEY'RE RUNNING UP
THIS MOUNTAIN SHIRTLESS.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.701
WHEN I'M NOT TALKING,

10:00.701 --> 10:03.874
THAT SCENE
IS WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT.

10:03.874 --> 10:05.836
(sighs)

10:07.337 --> 10:10.641
OKAY. SO YOU KIND OF CAN'T
PRACTICE WITHOUT A PARTNER.

10:10.641 --> 10:11.742
TRAVIS, GET UP.

10:11.742 --> 10:13.684
(thud)
MAN.

10:13.684 --> 10:16.116
THERE'S NO DUDE-ON-DUDE DANCING
IN WANG TOWN.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.648
THE WORST ONE YET.

10:17.648 --> 10:20.751
I'M GLAD WE DID
THE PATERNITY TEST TOGETHER.

10:20.751 --> 10:21.892
THANKS, GRAYMOND.

10:21.892 --> 10:24.024
"GRAYMOND"?
THAT'S NOT HIS NAME.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.956
IT'S NOT A NAME.

10:25.956 --> 10:27.627
SURE, IT IS.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.330
THERE'S A FRIGGIN' SHOW CALLED
"EVERYONE LOVES GRAYMOND."

10:30.330 --> 10:31.732
(whispers) GET HER OUT.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.934
UM, WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE GET THE RESULTS, OKAY?

10:33.934 --> 10:34.935
OKAY.

10:37.367 --> 10:40.640
(door opens and closes)
HEY, ONCE WE FIND OUT
THAT I'M NOT THE FATHER,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.242
WHICH "MAURY POVICH SHOW"
CELEBRATION DANCE

10:42.242 --> 10:44.044
ARE YOU GON' DO?

10:44.044 --> 10:47.748
I'M GONNA DO THE "BOOB-SHIMMY,
DOUBLE POINT-TO-GOD."
(snaps fingers)

10:47.748 --> 10:49.880
I'M GONNA DO
THE FINGER-'STACHE-PIMP-LIP.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.422
WHAT'S UP?
WASN'T ME. WASN'T ME.

10:52.422 --> 10:54.384
(sings indistinctly)

10:54.384 --> 10:55.726
(both singing indistinctly)

10:55.726 --> 10:57.187
YOU'RE SUCH A FUN COUPLE.
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT.

10:57.187 --> 10:58.759
YOU BETTER BE--

10:58.759 --> 11:02.162
WELL, GOT YOUR TEST RESULTS.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.794
THANKS FOR USING
YOUR INFLUENCE AT THE HOSPITAL

11:03.794 --> 11:04.835
TO GET THESE SO FAST.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.296
THE HEAD NURSE
WOULD ONLY GIVE IT TO ME

11:06.296 --> 11:08.969
IF I BEAT HER AT ARM WRESTLING,
SO I HAD TO STEAL IT.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.841
HERE WE GO. (sighs)

11:10.841 --> 11:12.002
OKAY, WAIT.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.045
PROMISE ME THAT
NO MATTER WHAT,

11:15.045 --> 11:17.808
WE'RE GONNA BE REALLY MATURE
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

11:17.808 --> 11:18.949
I PROMISE.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.053
I'M THE FATHER.

11:25.355 --> 11:28.318
(glass shattering)

11:28.318 --> 11:29.760
(clatter)

11:29.760 --> 11:31.992
(pants)

11:31.992 --> 11:35.195
I'M GONNA SKEDADDLE.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.828
ALL RIGHT.
TENTH TIME'S A CHARM.

11:37.828 --> 11:40.470
NOW HERE COMES A WAVE.
I WANT YOU TO PADDLE AND POP UP.

11:40.470 --> 11:42.302
ALL RIGHT? PADDLE AND POP UP.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.204
STOP SAYING,
"PADDLE AND POP UP"!

11:44.204 --> 11:47.878
LAST TIME I TRIED THAT,
I GOT A SALTWATER NOSE ENEMA.

11:47.878 --> 11:49.379
PROBLEM IS
YOU SWITCHED YOUR STANCE.

11:49.379 --> 11:52.813
YOUR REDNECK GIBBERISH IS EVEN
HARDER TO UNDERSTAND THAN USUAL.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.214
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.886
"FRIME GERST FRYING
TO FURBLE-DERBLE"?

11:55.886 --> 11:58.348
THAT'S IT. I'M DONE.

11:58.348 --> 12:01.421
I QUIT ANYWAY. SEE YA, BRAH.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.393
(Ellie screams)

12:09.199 --> 12:10.500
(all) HUH!

12:10.500 --> 12:12.933
TRAV. HONEY, YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE SOME MOVES.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.766
TWO SUMMERS OF PRETEEN DANCE
CAMP WITH MY MOMS. WHAT UP?

12:15.766 --> 12:16.767
OH, NO.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.408
DID YOU JUST TRY
TO MAKE THAT SOUND COOL?

12:18.408 --> 12:20.110
I DID, AND I REGRET IT.

12:20.110 --> 12:22.212
WITH YOU NEXT TO ME,
I THINK I CAN DO THIS.

12:22.212 --> 12:24.845
ALL THE GUYS KNOW YOU ALREADY.
DO IT WITH ME.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.477
I'M SORRY, BRO,
BUT... NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

12:27.477 --> 12:28.919
I'M GONNA DIE
UP THERE, MAN.

12:28.919 --> 12:30.150
(lowered voice)
LET ME HANDLE THIS, OKAY?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.982
TRAV HAS HAD
A CRUSH ON ME FOREVER.

12:31.982 --> 12:34.524
THE BOY HAS LITERALLY
NEVER SAID NO TO ME.

12:34.524 --> 12:36.827
PUT YOUR EARBUDS IN SO I CAN
TALK TO HIM. (whispers) COME ON.

12:36.827 --> 12:39.759
OHH.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.431
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT SIG...

12:41.431 --> 12:42.793
SONG HASN'T STARTED YET.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.134
YEAH, YOU'LL BE FINE.

12:44.134 --> 12:47.467
BUT I THINK IT'D BE REALLY COOL
TO SEE YOU DANCE.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.439
PRETTY PLEASE, TRAVIS?

12:49.439 --> 12:50.971
FOR ME?

12:50.971 --> 12:51.972
(sighs)

12:51.972 --> 12:53.173
NO.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.875
HUAH!

12:58.849 --> 13:00.450
BIG CARL
IS A MIRACLE WORKER,

13:00.450 --> 13:02.452
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE CAN FIX THIS.

13:03.513 --> 13:06.917
NO, NO. LET HIM TRY.

13:06.917 --> 13:11.361
SITTING THERE, ALL DEPRESSED,
YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

13:12.823 --> 13:14.264
WHY DON'T WE GO UPSTAIRS

13:14.264 --> 13:17.267
AND MAKE A BABY THAT'S EVEN
BETTER THAN MY OTHER BABY?

13:17.267 --> 13:18.428
ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:18.428 --> 13:20.000
YES...

13:20.000 --> 13:23.904
BUT WE'RE NOT READY TO JOKE,
AND I KNOW THAT NOW.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.936
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD
OF BIRTH CONTROL?

13:25.936 --> 13:27.407
SHE SAID SHE HAD IT COVERED.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.910
SHE PROBABLY MEANT SHE WOULD
JUMP UP AND DOWN AFTER.

13:29.910 --> 13:33.884
LOOK, JULES, I NEED TO KNOW
THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS...

13:33.884 --> 13:37.087
YOU KNOW, THAT THIS
ISN'T A DEAL-BREAKER.

13:38.088 --> 13:39.890
IS IT?

13:41.952 --> 13:44.054
I DON'T KNOW.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.000
LOOK, I KNOW THIS HAPPENED

13:50.000 --> 13:51.331
BEFORE YOU AND I WERE EVEN
DATING, BUT DOES THAT MEAN

13:51.331 --> 13:54.034
I CAN'T BE MAD AT HIM
FOR MESSING UP OUR LIFE?

13:54.034 --> 13:56.867
LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION.
WHO'S HE?

13:56.867 --> 13:58.408
ANDY TORRES.
HOW YOU DOING?

13:58.408 --> 13:59.839
I THOUGHT I WOULD
PRACTICE WITH HIM

13:59.839 --> 14:01.411
BEFORE I BRING IN
MY REAL FIANCE.

14:01.411 --> 14:03.543
I'M JUST HAPPY
SOMEONE WANTS ME AROUND.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.146
NOW WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE
NO ONE WANTS YOU AROUND?

14:06.146 --> 14:07.577
WELL, SINCE I WAS A KID--

14:07.577 --> 14:08.919
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

14:08.919 --> 14:11.221
NO, JULES, CHILDHOOD ISSUES
ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

14:11.221 --> 14:12.953
FOR INSTANCE,
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

14:12.953 --> 14:14.224
THE NEIGHBORHOOD--
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU,
EITHER, LYNN.

14:14.224 --> 14:16.957
THIS IS MY HOUR.
NOW PRETEND TO BE GRAYSON.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.460
(sighs) LOVER, YOU GOT TO ACCEPT
THAT THIS BABY IS A REALITY.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.461
YEAH, BUT--

14:21.461 --> 14:23.293
NO "YEAH, BUTs,"
YOU SELFISH JERK.

14:23.293 --> 14:26.066
I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
PULL IT BACK A LITTLE.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.538
SORRY, BUT YOU KNOW
HOW BADLY I WANTED A CHILD,

14:28.538 --> 14:31.641
AND NOW I HAVE ONE, BUT THANKS
TO YOUR "NO BAGGAGE" POLICY,

14:31.641 --> 14:33.303
I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED
TO BE HAPPY.

14:33.303 --> 14:34.344
HE'S NOT DOING IT RIGHT.

14:34.344 --> 14:37.547
NO, NO, FAKE GRAYSON
HAS MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.950
LOOK, YOU CAN'T CHANGE
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

14:39.950 --> 14:43.113
ALL YOU CAN DO IS DECIDE WHETHER
OR NOT YOU CAN LIVE WITH IT.

14:44.454 --> 14:46.456
DON'T YOU QUIT ON ME, GIRL.

14:46.456 --> 14:47.918
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:47.918 --> 14:49.619
I... DON'T KNOW.

14:49.619 --> 14:53.293
E-TRAIN, I AM GLAD
TO BE DONE AS YOUR TEACHER.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.196
BYE, NEW GIRLFRIEND. I'M SORRY
YOU HAVE TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.897
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S GOOD AT IT.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.529
(scoffs)

14:59.529 --> 15:02.472
ANDY IS RIGHT.
SHE IS UNTEACHABLE.

15:02.472 --> 15:04.074
SHE JUST HAS HER WALLS UP.

15:04.074 --> 15:05.936
REMINDS ME OF WHEN
I TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL.

15:05.936 --> 15:07.577
THERE WAS THIS ONE GANGBANGER
NAMED SHADOW.

15:07.577 --> 15:10.180
HE USED TO LEAVE
DEAD RATS IN MY CAR...

15:10.180 --> 15:12.342
DID HE PUT 'EM IN THERE DEAD,
OR WERE THEY ALIVE AT FIRST

15:12.342 --> 15:13.413
AND THEN THEY DIED
FROM THE HEAT?

15:13.413 --> 15:16.186
IT'S NOT REALLY
A BIG PART OF THE STORY.

15:16.186 --> 15:17.187
WELL, HE COULDN'T HAVE
CRACKED THE WINDOW.

15:17.187 --> 15:18.418
THEY WOULD HAVE
JUST GOTTEN AWAY.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.550
YOU KNOW, A RAT COULD SNEAK
THROUGH A SPACE THIS TINY.

15:20.550 --> 15:24.224
IF IT'S COOL WITH YOU,
I'LL JUST GET BACK TO MY POINT.

15:24.224 --> 15:28.298
SHADOW TRIED TO SCARE ME OFF,
BUT I NEVER GAVE UP ON HIM.

15:28.298 --> 15:31.061
ELLIE'S YOUR SHADOW.
YOU JUST HAVE TO LET HER KNOW

15:31.061 --> 15:32.362
THAT YOU'LL STICK TO IT
NO MATTER WHAT.

15:32.362 --> 15:35.365
YEAH, BUT ELLIE'S
NOT A GANGBANGER.

15:35.365 --> 15:37.067
(man) в™Є PEOPLE NOWADAYS
DON'T THINK 'BOUT THEY WAYS в™Є

15:37.067 --> 15:39.569
в™Є DON'T THINK BEFORE THEY DO,
DON'T THINK BEFORE THEY SAY в™Є

15:39.569 --> 15:43.313
в™Є HAPHAZARD WITH THE LANGUAGE
AND ACTIONS в™Є

15:43.313 --> 15:46.146
COME ON.
LET'S GO CHEER SIG ON.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.247
PASS.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.448
(clatter)

15:48.448 --> 15:50.380
YOU REALLY GOT TO GET OVER
THIS THING WITH BOOKS.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.222
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH US?

15:52.222 --> 15:55.055
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN COME
TO LOUIE WITH ME YESTERDAY.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.726
I JUST--I DON'T GET IT.

15:56.726 --> 15:59.129
DON'T BLAME IT
ON YOUR STUPID HELMET.

15:59.129 --> 16:02.962
ALL YOU NON-HELMETS
THINK IT'S JUST SO EASY.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.235
A YEAR AGO, YOU WOULD HAVE
COME TO LUNCH WITH ME

16:05.235 --> 16:09.169
EVEN IF I ASKED YOU TO WEAR
NOTHING BUT A SOCK ON YOUR JUNK.

16:09.169 --> 16:14.274
I MISS THE GUY THAT WOULD
DO ANYTHING TO SEE ME SMILE.

16:15.345 --> 16:18.178
IT GOT A LITTLE
TOO FLIRTY FOR ME.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.209
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

16:19.209 --> 16:20.710
IT'S JUST NOT AS MUCH FUN

16:20.710 --> 16:23.313
WHEN YOU GET STUCK ON SOMEONE

16:23.313 --> 16:25.715
AND THEN YOU START
THINKING ABOUT 'EM ALL THE TIME

16:25.715 --> 16:30.420
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW
NOTHING REAL WILL EVER HAPPEN.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.322
JUST...

16:32.322 --> 16:35.265
MAKES YOU FEEL KIND OF STUPID,
YOU KNOW?

16:35.265 --> 16:37.567
YEAH, I GET THAT.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.201
KIND OF SUCKS FOR ME.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.074
IT MADE ME FEEL SPECIAL,
SO...

16:44.074 --> 16:45.335
SORRY.

16:45.335 --> 16:48.538
(scoffs) IT'S OKAY.

16:48.538 --> 16:51.481
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, TRAV.

16:51.481 --> 16:52.642
OH...

16:52.642 --> 16:57.016
YOU SHOULD CALL THIS PLACE
THE PANTY GRAVEYARD.

16:58.088 --> 16:59.089
(door opens)

16:59.089 --> 17:01.391
IT'S PERFECT.
(door closes)

17:03.053 --> 17:05.295
I'M WAVE-SITTING. GO AWAY.

17:05.295 --> 17:08.598
NOPE. YOU'RE MY SHADOW.
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.

17:08.598 --> 17:11.301
WHY? I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE.

17:12.462 --> 17:14.164
HEY.

17:14.164 --> 17:15.465
SERIOUSLY?

17:15.465 --> 17:16.736
WHAT? I MISSED YOU.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.469
ELLIE. I NEED YOU.

17:19.469 --> 17:22.142
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

17:22.142 --> 17:25.715
YOU'RE ALL CRAZY.
I'M GOING IN.

17:25.715 --> 17:28.218
WELL, THEN,
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

17:29.219 --> 17:30.450
(Jules and Ellie scream)

17:32.582 --> 17:34.484
OH. UHH!

17:35.325 --> 17:39.329
CAN WE PLEASE TALK?

17:39.329 --> 17:41.731
IT'S LIKE HE TOOK OUR FUTURE
INTO THE WOODS

17:41.731 --> 17:43.693
AND SHOT IT IN THE FACE.

17:43.693 --> 17:46.366
UH, MA'AM? WHERE DID YOU
GET THOSE SUNGLASSES?

17:46.366 --> 17:49.399
THEY'RE PROBABLY YOURS.
YOU LEFT 'EM AT GRAYMOND'S?

17:49.399 --> 17:52.502
UNLESS YOU'RE PREGNANT,
YOU JUST CAN KEEP ON MOVING.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.145
(whispers) KEEP ON MOVING. GO.

17:55.145 --> 17:57.777
YOU'RE BEING
SUCH A DUMMY.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.350
YEAH, YOU PROMISED GRAYMOND
YOU'D HAVE A KID,

18:00.350 --> 18:02.382
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.354
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
MAYBE I DO.

18:04.354 --> 18:06.856
THEN HAVE ONE.
I DON'T WANT TO.

18:06.856 --> 18:09.359
THIS WAY,
HE GETS HIS DREAM KID,

18:09.359 --> 18:12.562
AND YOUR 43-YEAR-OLD EGG-MAKER
GETS OFF SCOT-FREE.

18:12.562 --> 18:13.793
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.326
HE HAS A CHILD
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

18:16.326 --> 18:17.597

YEAH.

18:25.735 --> 18:27.437
OH, MAN.

18:27.437 --> 18:29.879
IT'S EXHAUSTING THINKING
OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

18:29.879 --> 18:32.412
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I STOPPED DOING IT.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.713

A LITTLE REHEARSED.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.571

19:32.402 --> 19:34.544
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:34.544 --> 19:36.676
I HOPE A SHARK
EATS YOUR FACE.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.609
EVEN IF ONE DID,
I STILL WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON YOU.

19:39.609 --> 19:40.750
REALLY?

19:40.750 --> 19:43.883

20:07.977 --> 20:10.610
SHE YELLED FROM THE SHOWER
THAT IT WAS FINE.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.682
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
SHE KNEW IT WAS ME.

20:12.682 --> 20:15.485
OH, TAMPA'S A CUTIE.

20:16.586 --> 20:18.618
OH, GOOD GOD,
SHE'S WEARING GLITTER BLUSH.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.491
THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY IF YOU'RE
GONNA BE A PART OF OUR FAMILY.

20:22.552 --> 20:24.524

YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?

20:24.524 --> 20:26.526
