Julia, hurry up and put your bike away.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.541
Julia, come on, honey.

01:25.666 --> 01:28.458
- You'll be late for school.
- Okay, Mom.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.708
And one final adjustment...

01:33.833 --> 01:36.625
You've said that
seven times already, Crick.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.791
- Come on, let's swing!
- Wait for me!

01:47.250 --> 01:49.625
What's that scary sound?

01:51.416 --> 01:53.875
Incoming! Run for cover!

02:08.583 --> 02:12.083
Whoa, what was that?

02:20.625 --> 02:23.625
Must protect nest. Must protect...

02:25.666 --> 02:27.208
What is that?

02:27.625 --> 02:29.833
It's a disaster. A catastrophe.

02:29.958 --> 02:32.041
It's... It's a disast-rophe.

02:33.416 --> 02:35.875
Stay back, it's too dangerous!

02:36.541 --> 02:38.625
Uh, but our nest is right there.

02:38.750 --> 02:39.791
What if it falls?

02:40.791 --> 02:44.041
What if it falls?
What if it falls? What if it falls?

02:44.125 --> 02:48.375
Uh, if you would allow me to...
Uh, to assist?

02:49.250 --> 02:52.125
Uh, the, uh, nest seems undamaged.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.416
Possibly, we can, uh, save it.

02:54.541 --> 02:59.250
Let's see.
Angle of maniacal machine, 45 degrees...

03:01.333 --> 03:04.166
It's moving! Get down!

03:04.958 --> 03:08.375
And if I calculate the trajectory of the--

03:10.000 --> 03:11.583
Crick, it's gonna...

03:15.250 --> 03:16.916
...fall.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.416
Whoa, you just made things way worse.

03:25.541 --> 03:29.708
Our home. Our home. Our beautiful home.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.541
Where will we live now?

03:32.166 --> 03:37.458
Um, I feel, uh... somewhat responsible.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.708
Perhaps you could, uh... move in with us.

03:46.208 --> 03:47.708
Let's move in!

03:47.833 --> 03:52.125
Move in. Move in. Move in.

03:54.083 --> 03:58.916
Awesome! New friends to play with.

03:59.333 --> 04:03.625
Um, did you just invite an entire
ant colony to sleep over?

04:11.666 --> 04:12.875
Welcome, everyone.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.666
Um, there's five houses
for you to stay in.

04:15.791 --> 04:19.375
- The first is Walter's house. The second--
- Walter's house!

04:19.500 --> 04:21.291
Yeah, Walter's house!

04:22.708 --> 04:24.625
Walter's house.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.208
Uh, well, you can't, uh...

04:30.333 --> 04:32.166
You can't all fit in one house.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.125
Um, divide into five groups, please.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.500
We are divided into five groups.

04:37.666 --> 04:38.875
Okay...

04:38.958 --> 04:41.708
Uh, group one, step forward.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.000
We are group one.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.750
But you can't all be group one.

04:48.416 --> 04:50.291
We are not all group one.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
This may, uh, take a while.

04:56.125 --> 05:01.250
You put the straw
in your mouths, like this...

05:01.791 --> 05:04.833
Now slurp, like this...

05:11.166 --> 05:13.083
That's it. You got it.

05:13.208 --> 05:15.375
You've got it, antsies.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.041
Welcome to my humble,
yet stylish abode.

05:19.166 --> 05:23.875
Please enjoy a succulent selection
of culinary sensations.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.166
Oh, my.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.416
Wait, I didn't teach you how to stop!

05:42.250 --> 05:44.583
Please, don't touch that. Oh, or that.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.250
I have to-- No, no, no.
No, definitely not that.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.500
And, uh, there's lots of extra pillows,

05:54.625 --> 05:57.333
so, please, make yourself at home.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.208
My bed?

06:03.333 --> 06:05.041
Very at home.

06:07.291 --> 06:10.000
At least my ants slept well.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.500
And... I slept in the tub.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.625
My ants loved my cooking.

06:14.750 --> 06:19.250
And my plates, and my wallpaper...

06:19.375 --> 06:23.083
They, uh, totally re-organized
my workshop,

06:23.208 --> 06:25.375
but not in a good way.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.583
Oh, yeah? Check this out.

06:29.333 --> 06:33.916
Come and see. Come and see.
It's awesome!

06:34.083 --> 06:37.583
Heave ho, heave ho, heave ho...

06:37.666 --> 06:39.833
Uh, what are you doing?

06:39.958 --> 06:42.000
We're digging our new home.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.625
You're digging it here?

06:44.750 --> 06:46.291
Yeah, we're digging here.

06:46.375 --> 06:49.333
Uh, we want to be close to you,
our new friends.

06:49.416 --> 06:50.958
Yeah, new friends.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.500
New friends. New friends.

06:53.583 --> 06:57.666
Yippee, together forever!

06:58.291 --> 07:03.000
Heave ho, heave ho, heave ho...

07:10.708 --> 07:12.083
I'm sorry,

07:12.208 --> 07:15.666

07:41.333 --> 07:43.458
But we can't kick them out.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.125
They like us too much.

07:45.250 --> 07:48.000
And they have to live somewhere.

07:48.166 --> 07:50.416
This is my new friend.

07:50.541 --> 07:53.250
He's homesick.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.708
Aw. Come here.

07:55.875 --> 08:00.041

Your old home?

08:07.625 --> 08:09.041
Yes, please.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.041
But we can't.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.666
Can we?

08:14.166 --> 08:20.708
May I present the new improved
crickta-crank.

08:20.833 --> 08:24.583
As you see, it is attached
to the, uh, maniacal machine,

08:24.708 --> 08:27.833
so, we can lift it off the ants' nest.

08:27.958 --> 08:30.083
Oh, lift it. Yeah.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.207
Lift, lift, lift...

08:32.332 --> 08:36.332
So, uh, if we could start
pulling the rope.

08:46.708 --> 08:49.375
Now, get underneath, ants. Carry it away.

08:53.875 --> 08:56.125
Come on, pull...

09:00.083 --> 09:02.916
-It's way too heavy, Crick.
-Now what do we do?

09:03.458 --> 09:04.666
Hmm.

09:09.375 --> 09:10.208
Ah!

09:10.291 --> 09:12.875
Yes, of course.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.208
Yeah, that's the way.

09:18.375 --> 09:19.916
Take it all to pieces.

09:43.416 --> 09:48.083
According to my crickto-calculations,
you can, um... Um, do it.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.625
We can do it. We can do it. We can do it.

09:52.791 --> 09:58.333

11:16.875 --> 11:21.041

12:40.625 --> 12:42.291
Whoa, whoa!

12:42.375 --> 12:44.416
Huh?

12:46.083 --> 12:50.083
This is a story, a true story...

12:50.208 --> 12:52.375
About the truest kind of friend.

12:52.500 --> 12:56.750
It starts in the middle of the night.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.083
It was the middle of the night,

12:59.208 --> 13:01.375
and a flock of birds
were following the sun...

13:01.458 --> 13:03.375
Hmm? Mm-mm.

13:03.458 --> 13:08.166
Uh, wait, sorry. If it was night,
then they were following Mr. Moon.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.875
But Blackbird was daydreaming.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.750
The sort of daydreaming
you do in the dark.

13:13.833 --> 13:18.083
So, perhaps it was, uh... night-dreaming.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.958
Good evening, birds.

13:20.125 --> 13:23.625
What a marvelous night for flying.

13:25.833 --> 13:27.625
Oh, hello. Little bird?

13:27.750 --> 13:30.333
You are headed right at me.

13:30.458 --> 13:33.125
Hey, bird, I'm right here, and...

13:33.250 --> 13:34.666
I can't move quickly.

13:34.791 --> 13:37.625
It takes me an entire night to-- Look out!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.250
Aah! Oh, no. Unh!

13:39.333 --> 13:40.416
Ouchie.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.041
Oh, no.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.750
Huh?! What was that?

13:56.958 --> 13:58.250
You heard it, too?

14:06.500 --> 14:08.625
What's happening? I heard a crash.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.166
Eleven... Eleven on the crickter-scale.

14:14.208 --> 14:17.375
Oh, my. I was asleep,
and then I heard a bang,

14:17.458 --> 14:19.958
and then I was like,
"What is happening?"

14:20.041 --> 14:22.125
And then there was
another bang, and then...

14:23.541 --> 14:24.916
And then that.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.750
Oh, this is too much.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.541
Wait. Shh.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.708
Who was it? Who was it?

14:44.833 --> 14:47.708
- Tell us, who was it?
- Yeah, tell us who.

14:47.833 --> 14:50.708
Ha, ha. Wait, wait.
We're trying to tell the story.

14:50.833 --> 14:56.041
Yeah. So, then... Uh, then... Uh...

14:56.125 --> 14:58.666
What happened then, Kumi?

15:00.125 --> 15:01.916
Then we followed the sound.

15:11.416 --> 15:13.916
You're in trouble now, bird.

15:19.666 --> 15:21.500
You look bad.

15:21.666 --> 15:24.250
What you gonna do
with a broken wing, huh?

15:28.250 --> 15:30.166
What is it?

15:30.291 --> 15:33.125
I think it's a blackbird.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.791
A blackbird?

15:39.083 --> 15:42.750
Aw. Look at those sunken eyes.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.708
But why is she so sad?

15:45.833 --> 15:48.916
Because she should be up there.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.750
You said it, little bugs.

15:52.875 --> 15:57.041
I gotta get back up in the sky
before my flock leaves me behind.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.375
Ouchie!

16:11.833 --> 16:14.166
We have to help her.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.625
Oh! Are you okay?

16:20.041 --> 16:23.916
No. I'm never gonna fly
with this broken wing.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.458
And it's all my fault.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.750
How is it your fault?

16:28.875 --> 16:32.125
I was daydreaming, like always.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.375
Wasn't watching where I was going.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.666
But how does you daydream at night?

16:36.791 --> 16:40.458
Only the best daydreamers
can daydream at night.

16:40.583 --> 16:44.125
You must be the best daydreamer ever.

16:45.791 --> 16:50.833
Uh, Blackbird, I think I know
how to get you flying again.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.041
Flying? With my broken wing?

16:54.166 --> 16:59.458
Yes. Uh, with the help
of a special crick-vention.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.916
What kind of crick-vention?

17:01.000 --> 17:04.125
Uh, I don't know yet exactly.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.790
But I'm sure I can think of something.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.875
No, that's not it.

17:29.458 --> 17:33.125
How about... balloons?

17:42.583 --> 17:43.500
Huh?

17:46.791 --> 17:52.833
I know. Let's try... a parachute.

18:00.208 --> 18:05.250
Hold on. This time I've definitely got it.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.541
By my crickto-calculations,

18:15.666 --> 18:18.000
you just have to pull on that and--

18:22.666 --> 18:24.208
Awesome.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.666
Hey, I... I'm flying.

18:27.791 --> 18:30.083
I'm flying.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.250
Not flying no more.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Sorry, Blackbird.
Inventing is like a daydream,

18:43.125 --> 18:47.291
and I guess I'm not as good
a daydreamer as you are.

18:47.416 --> 18:51.166
Don't say that. Anyone can daydream.

18:51.291 --> 18:54.291
You just have to, uh...

18:54.375 --> 18:57.041
fly after and find your imagination.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.916
Come on, try it with me now.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.625
What's the clouds made of?

19:16.750 --> 19:19.875
They're made from daydreams.

19:23.750 --> 19:27.666
Wait, I think I have another idea.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.333
This, uh... This is it.

19:36.916 --> 19:39.166
It's awesome.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.708
So awesome.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.083
I love it, Crick.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.208

22:40.958 --> 22:43.833
It's hard to fly with just one good wing,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.583
and even harder to find true friends,
like you bugs.
