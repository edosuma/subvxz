WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:05.046
Oh, honey, I can't

00:03.086 --> 00:05.046
do any more tonight.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.633
Let's just leave the mess

00:05.088 --> 00:07.633
and get some sleep, huh?

00:07.675 --> 00:09.510
Wait a minute,

00:07.675 --> 00:09.510
we bought ten presents.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.386
HAL:

00:09.551 --> 00:11.386
Yeah?

00:11.428 --> 00:13.012
Why are there

00:11.428 --> 00:13.012
11 packages?

00:15.474 --> 00:17.184
Oh, my God.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.062
(Hal sighs)

00:21.647 --> 00:24.191
(Hal and Lois laugh)

00:24.232 --> 00:26.234
Oh... we would have

00:24.232 --> 00:26.234
figured it out

00:26.276 --> 00:28.069
before we mailed it, right?

00:28.111 --> 00:31.323
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

Ow! Did you get it?

01:14.825 --> 01:17.578
Get what?

01:19.914 --> 01:21.456
It's three weeks till Christmas,

01:21.498 --> 01:23.375
and Reese is holding off

01:21.498 --> 01:23.375
hitting Dewey

01:23.417 --> 01:25.002
till after the holidays.

01:25.044 --> 01:25.669
HAL:

01:25.044 --> 01:25.669
Well,

01:25.711 --> 01:27.128
guess what?

01:27.170 --> 01:29.715
I got two weeks forced vacation

01:27.170 --> 01:29.715
without pay.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.132
What?!

01:29.757 --> 01:31.132
Thanks to the company's trouble

01:31.174 --> 01:32.509
with the government,

01:31.174 --> 01:32.509
they sent everybody home

01:32.551 --> 01:33.928
till the new year.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.846
We think it's just

01:33.969 --> 01:35.846
so the board members

01:35.888 --> 01:37.389
can shred documents in peace.

01:37.431 --> 01:41.142
Two weeks without pay?

01:37.431 --> 01:41.142
At Christmas?!

01:41.184 --> 01:43.020
That means no presents.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.855
December 2.

01:44.897 --> 01:48.316
Refused to eat

01:44.897 --> 01:48.316
booger sandwich.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.693
I know this is coming

01:48.358 --> 01:49.693
at a bad time,

01:49.735 --> 01:51.152
but I think

01:49.735 --> 01:51.152
I have a plan

01:51.194 --> 01:54.155
that'll make us enough money

01:51.194 --> 01:54.155
to get through this.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.908
I'm going to sell

01:54.197 --> 01:55.908
Christmas trees.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.158
What?

01:55.950 --> 01:57.158
In college,

01:57.200 --> 01:58.911
I sold Christmas trees

01:57.200 --> 01:58.911
every December

01:58.953 --> 02:00.161
with my roommate Victor.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.330
I thought he sold

02:00.203 --> 02:02.330
illegal cable boxes.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.750
To pay for the Christmas trees.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.460
We made a killing.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.837
Look, I've already talked

02:06.501 --> 02:08.837
to a supplier.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.882
We have enough to buy 130

02:08.879 --> 02:11.882
trees at 15 bucks apiece.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.174
Oh, and Ed from the office

02:13.216 --> 02:15.636
is letting me use

02:13.216 --> 02:15.636
his vacant lot for free.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.887
Really?

02:16.929 --> 02:18.680
If we sell them

02:16.929 --> 02:18.680
at six bucks a foot--

02:18.722 --> 02:21.266
that's an average

02:18.722 --> 02:21.266
of $45 a tree-- Lois,

02:21.308 --> 02:23.769
we can net over $2,600.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.186
Well, if you think it'll work.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.188
Hey, Reese and I have

02:25.228 --> 02:27.188
some money saved up.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.190
If we go in on this,

02:27.230 --> 02:29.190
we can get 200 trees.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.734
We'd make $4,000.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.361
You'd put your own money in?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.989
Sure. I was going

02:33.403 --> 02:34.989
to invest mine

02:35.030 --> 02:37.365
with this Nigerian General

02:35.030 --> 02:37.365
who's been sending me e-mails,

02:37.407 --> 02:39.242
but, hey, this is family.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.201
Really?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.578
You boys would actually

02:41.620 --> 02:43.747
go into business

02:41.620 --> 02:43.747
with your old man?

02:44.915 --> 02:49.210
I never dreamed anything

02:44.915 --> 02:49.210
like this would be possible.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.671
Dad...

02:49.252 --> 02:50.671
When I was a kid,

02:50.712 --> 02:53.214
I begged my dad to go

02:50.712 --> 02:53.214
into business with me

02:53.256 --> 02:57.218
a bunch of times, but he

02:53.256 --> 02:57.218
never answered the intercom.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.470
And now you boys

02:58.512 --> 03:00.347
want to go into business

02:58.512 --> 03:00.347
with me.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.974
(crying)

03:03.266 --> 03:06.687
(crying): It'll be like

03:03.266 --> 03:06.687
a Korean grocery store!

03:06.728 --> 03:09.148
(whispers):

03:06.728 --> 03:09.148
You know, Dewey,

03:09.188 --> 03:11.566
you've got $20 in

03:09.188 --> 03:11.566
your piggy bank.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.694
I think they've

03:11.608 --> 03:13.694
got it covered, Mom.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.738
All right. I'm in.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.158
(sobbing)

03:21.326 --> 03:26.247
It's gonna be weird not being

03:21.326 --> 03:26.247
with our families on Christmas.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.708
I know. It feels...

03:27.749 --> 03:28.917
great!

03:28.959 --> 03:30.794
It's like all

03:28.959 --> 03:30.794
the ugliness and turmoil

03:30.836 --> 03:33.005
you always associate

03:30.836 --> 03:33.005
with Christmas is gone.

03:33.047 --> 03:35.549
My family!

03:33.047 --> 03:35.549
They are finally here!

03:35.590 --> 03:37.718
All the way

03:35.590 --> 03:37.718
from Stuttgart!

03:37.759 --> 03:39.720
"Don't pack

03:37.759 --> 03:39.720
your heavy clothes.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.555
It's not cold in the desert."

03:41.596 --> 03:43.306
I'm freezing off my ass!

03:43.348 --> 03:44.599
WOMAN:

03:43.348 --> 03:44.599
Stop whining! I already

03:44.641 --> 03:46.351
have two children;

03:44.641 --> 03:46.351
I don't need a third!

03:46.393 --> 03:47.728
Oh, come on,

03:46.393 --> 03:47.728
you two.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.313
You're here now.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.313
Just enjoy.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.732
Oh, I forgot.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.943
Everything has to be

03:51.773 --> 03:54.943
perfect with Gretchen.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.028
OTTO:

03:54.985 --> 03:56.028
Don't you raise

03:56.070 --> 03:57.529
your voice to Gretchen.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.573
Anyone who is

03:57.571 --> 03:59.573
not an alcoholic,

03:59.614 --> 04:02.283
you accuse of being

03:59.614 --> 04:02.283
a perfectionist.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.369
(all shouting)

04:13.921 --> 04:16.006
Hal and Sons.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.425
That means you,

04:16.048 --> 04:18.425
too, Jamie.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.301
(crying quietly)

04:20.343 --> 04:24.848
I know it's just

04:20.343 --> 04:24.848
a crappy wooden sign, but...

04:24.890 --> 04:28.227
boys, I want you to

04:24.890 --> 04:28.227
know that this is

04:28.268 --> 04:29.603
the greatest

04:28.268 --> 04:29.603
day of my life.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.312
I'm so happy

04:31.354 --> 04:33.648
and proud of each

04:31.354 --> 04:33.648
and every one of you,

04:33.690 --> 04:38.195
and I just want to make sure

04:33.690 --> 04:38.195
that you don't screw this up.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.571
We will have

04:39.613 --> 04:43.075
so many precious memories

04:39.613 --> 04:43.075
together,

04:43.117 --> 04:45.285
as long as you

04:43.117 --> 04:45.285
don't give in

04:45.326 --> 04:49.831
to your worst instincts and

04:45.326 --> 04:49.831
do something really stupid.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.083
I just love you

04:51.125 --> 04:52.126
so much,

04:52.167 --> 04:55.837
and I want to keep loving you.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.881
Dad, stop worrying.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.881
We can do this.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.050
With what we spent

04:57.923 --> 05:00.050
on trees and truck rental,

05:00.092 --> 05:02.010
we'll be in profit

05:00.092 --> 05:02.010
once we sell tree 67.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.471
Then let's just sell

05:02.052 --> 05:04.471
that tree first.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.265
What are those tools for?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.224
Let me show you.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.683
These are for setting up

05:07.266 --> 05:08.683
the trees.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.351
First you use

05:10.393 --> 05:13.063
the radial saw to cut an inch

05:10.393 --> 05:13.063
off the bottom of the trunk.

05:13.105 --> 05:16.066
Then you use this

05:13.105 --> 05:16.066
nail gun to stick

05:16.108 --> 05:17.943
the tree stand...

05:17.985 --> 05:20.904
Again, I am so proud of you boys

05:20.946 --> 05:23.865
and I don't want

05:20.946 --> 05:23.865
to lose this feeling.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.369
I don't know why you

05:25.867 --> 05:28.369
won't let me help you

05:28.411 --> 05:29.370
with that, Lois.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
Craig, please,

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
I really don't want you to.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.040
Why not?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.374
Because every time

05:33.416 --> 05:35.669
you come in contact

05:33.416 --> 05:35.669
with me and my family,

05:35.710 --> 05:37.296
something horrible

05:35.710 --> 05:37.296
happens to you.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.964
I can't deal with

05:37.336 --> 05:38.964
the guilt anymore.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.548
I don't know what

05:39.006 --> 05:40.548
you're talking about.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.384
Come on, if it weren't for us,

05:40.590 --> 05:43.384
you'd still have all your teeth;

05:43.426 --> 05:45.053
you wouldn't flinch

05:43.426 --> 05:45.053
every time you saw

05:45.095 --> 05:46.387
a ceiling fan;

05:45.095 --> 05:46.387
your car, it never

05:46.429 --> 05:47.764
would have been

05:46.429 --> 05:47.764
filled with bees.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.932
Coincidences.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.184
Craig, you broke your foot

05:50.225 --> 05:51.685
looking up a phone number

05:50.225 --> 05:51.685
for me.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.562
Please, Lois, it's Christmas.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.483
Here.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.569
Maybe you can fluff up

05:58.525 --> 06:01.569
the cotton on Santa's beard.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.738
Thank you.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.573
Ow! Oh!

06:06.449 --> 06:08.576
(gasps)

06:09.744 --> 06:10.954
(crying)

06:10.996 --> 06:13.874
Well, I wish I could say

06:10.996 --> 06:13.874
I was surprised.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.876
Okay.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.876
You're all set.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.752
Mister, is this tree dead?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.338
Well, of course not.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.298
We made sure we cut

06:19.378 --> 06:21.298
a fresh wound in the bottom

06:21.340 --> 06:23.550
of your tree

06:21.340 --> 06:23.550
so it could suck up water.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.760
That way, your tree

06:23.591 --> 06:25.760
is suspended in a netherworld

06:25.802 --> 06:28.429
between life and death,

06:28.471 --> 06:30.891
just waiting for you

06:28.471 --> 06:30.891
to open your presents.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.391
(laughs)

06:33.352 --> 06:35.436
How many trees

06:33.352 --> 06:35.436
have we sold?

06:35.478 --> 06:36.437
Fifteen.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.437
Fifteen?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.732
We're not anywhere

06:36.479 --> 06:38.732
close to tree 67.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.234
I don't get it.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.360
We're in a good location.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.694
We've got great

06:41.400 --> 06:42.694
looking trees.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.904
Excuse me.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.904
Hmm?

06:43.945 --> 06:44.988
How much are your trees?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.447
Six dollars a foot.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.448
Ah.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.448
What?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.450
Well, St. Mark's Church

06:47.490 --> 06:49.450
around the corner

06:49.492 --> 06:51.536
marked their trees down

06:49.492 --> 06:51.536
to five dollars a foot,

06:51.578 --> 06:55.249
but they've got such long lines,

06:51.578 --> 06:55.249
I thought I'd try you guys.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.253
You believe that church

06:56.499 --> 06:59.253
trying to undersell us?

06:59.294 --> 07:01.462
You don't see us offering

06:59.294 --> 07:01.462
Mass at half price.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.464
Why don't we lower the price

07:01.504 --> 07:03.464
on our trees?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.508
Like, down to, I don't know,

07:03.506 --> 07:05.508
$4.50 a foot?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.468
Then we average $31 a tree,

07:07.510 --> 07:09.470
and we still net... $3,457.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.474
We'll be profitable by--

07:09.512 --> 07:13.474
hang on-- tree 91.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.352
Tree 91?

07:15.394 --> 07:16.395
Tree 91.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.064
Sir! Sir!

07:24.861 --> 07:26.154
Right this way.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.407
We've got a really nice...

07:30.992 --> 07:33.536
It's customary

07:30.992 --> 07:33.536
to tie the tree to the roof.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.456
It's customary to tip the guy

07:33.578 --> 07:36.456
who tied it.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.959
All right!

07:39.000 --> 07:42.003
That was tree 79!

07:42.045 --> 07:43.463
We're very close!

07:43.504 --> 07:44.589
Boys,

07:44.631 --> 07:46.674
I love all of you.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.009
But this kid...

07:48.051 --> 07:50.095
(laughing)

07:50.137 --> 07:51.763
It's just a tiny bite, right?

07:51.805 --> 07:52.973
He's going to be okay?

07:53.014 --> 07:54.391
Oh, absolutely.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.184
Of course, he'll have

07:54.433 --> 07:56.184
to get rabies shots.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.184
Shots?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.978
Five injections,

07:56.226 --> 07:57.978
right in the belly.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.896
I had to get them

07:58.019 --> 07:59.896
when I was bitten

07:59.938 --> 08:01.564
by a skunk a

07:59.938 --> 08:01.564
few years ago.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.276
When they shoved that first

08:01.606 --> 08:04.276
four-inch needle

08:04.318 --> 08:07.988
into my stomach, I felt

08:04.318 --> 08:07.988
like I'd been shot in the gut.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.406
By the time

08:08.029 --> 08:09.406
they pulled

08:09.448 --> 08:11.532
the last needle out,

08:09.448 --> 08:11.532
I was on the floor,

08:11.574 --> 08:15.578
clutching a chair leg

08:11.574 --> 08:15.578
and crying like a baby.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.913
Navy Seals

08:16.955 --> 08:20.000
trained me to deal

08:16.955 --> 08:20.000
with pain, but...

08:20.041 --> 08:22.502
nothing like that.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.713
Well, you can always try

08:24.171 --> 08:25.713
to catch the squirrel

08:25.755 --> 08:27.132
and bring it

08:25.755 --> 08:27.132
to Animal Control.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.009
If they can confirm

08:27.174 --> 08:29.009
it doesn't have rabies,

08:29.050 --> 08:30.218
you could avoid the shots.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.553
No, I'll have

08:30.260 --> 08:32.553
to take the shots.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.555
Otherwise Lois can't prove

08:32.595 --> 08:34.555
her point.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.224
Craig, listen to me.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.268
I am making

08:36.266 --> 08:38.268
you this vow:

08:38.310 --> 08:40.228
I am going to find

08:38.310 --> 08:40.228
that squirrel

08:40.270 --> 08:42.022
and take it

08:40.270 --> 08:42.022
to Animal Control

08:42.063 --> 08:43.357
and prove it doesn't

08:42.063 --> 08:43.357
have rabies,

08:43.398 --> 08:45.025
so you do not have

08:43.398 --> 08:45.025
to get those shots.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.902
You are not going to suffer

08:45.066 --> 08:47.902
ever again for having known me.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.237
Understand?

08:49.279 --> 08:50.571
You're on my foot.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.699
Oh. Sorry.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.160
(both shouting in German)

08:57.620 --> 08:59.622
They're still at it?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.082
Yeah. It's fascinating.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.584
I've had the same argument

09:01.124 --> 09:03.584
a million times with my mom.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.338
Right now she's gonna say,

09:03.626 --> 09:06.338
"Don't take that tone with me,"

09:06.380 --> 09:08.173
and then he's gonna

09:06.380 --> 09:08.173
start screaming.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.550
(shouting in German continues)

09:14.221 --> 09:16.597
Now the father figure

09:14.221 --> 09:16.597
tries to make peace.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.100
(speaking German)

09:20.810 --> 09:22.603
And he gets his head

09:20.810 --> 09:22.603
chopped off.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.147
(shouting in German)

09:24.189 --> 09:25.690
FRANCIS:

09:24.189 --> 09:25.690
Oh, this is a good one.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.610
Jumping into someone else's

09:25.732 --> 09:29.610
argument to settle an old score.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.779
(shouting in German)

09:35.116 --> 09:36.576
(all shouting)

09:36.617 --> 09:39.120
They're like a primitive

09:36.617 --> 09:39.120
version of my family.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.914
Take one step to your left.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.707
Why?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.088
Spooky.

09:48.129 --> 09:51.341
Okay, you're getting

09:48.129 --> 09:51.341
seven dollars change, right?

09:51.383 --> 09:54.677
One and two and five.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.638
I hide the big bills where

09:54.719 --> 09:57.638
no one's gonna go after them.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.391
(chuckles)

09:57.680 --> 09:59.391
I'll help you with that.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.642
Okay, that is, uh,

09:59.433 --> 10:01.642
tree 89!

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
Boys, we are so close,

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
I can taste it!

10:03.978 --> 10:05.439
(gasps)

10:05.480 --> 10:08.649
You the guys trying to muscle in

10:05.480 --> 10:08.649
on the blessed church?

10:08.691 --> 10:09.984
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.652
We're from St. Mark's

10:10.026 --> 10:11.652
around the corner.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.114
You're underselling us,

10:11.694 --> 10:14.114
and we don't like it.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.615
So it's going to stop.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.451
We want you to close down

10:17.492 --> 10:20.245
your lot and leave. Now.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.663
During this holy season,

10:20.287 --> 10:22.663
it's best to give

10:22.705 --> 10:25.125
our Heavenly Savior

10:22.705 --> 10:25.125
what he wants.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.001
It might interest you

10:25.166 --> 10:27.001
to know that you're dealing

10:27.043 --> 10:28.378
with a bunch

10:27.043 --> 10:28.378
of godless heathens.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.338
Take your ghost stories

10:28.420 --> 10:30.338
somewhere else.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.133
We'll give you 20 minutes

10:30.380 --> 10:33.133
to clear out,

10:33.174 --> 10:36.595
then we take matters

10:33.174 --> 10:36.595
into our own hands.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.431
(neck cracks)

10:39.473 --> 10:41.266
What's that

10:39.473 --> 10:41.266
supposed to mean?

10:41.308 --> 10:42.683
Don't worry about it, Dad.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.353
They're priests.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.353
What are they gonna do?

10:45.395 --> 10:47.855
Just get in the car

10:45.395 --> 10:47.855
and lock the doors!

10:47.897 --> 10:49.149
Spare change,

10:47.897 --> 10:49.149
mister?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.692
Hey, mister!

10:49.190 --> 10:51.692
Come on!

10:53.487 --> 10:56.197
Does this look

10:53.487 --> 10:56.197
infected to you?

10:57.031 --> 10:58.492
Excuse me,

10:57.031 --> 10:58.492
this is my tree.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.702
I already marked it,

10:58.533 --> 11:01.702
if you know what I mean.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.204
Wha...! Wait, no!

11:03.246 --> 11:05.165
What the hell

11:03.246 --> 11:05.165
do you think you're doing?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.167
Father McKlusky

11:05.206 --> 11:07.167
sends his regards.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.209
What are you talking about?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.752
He dropped by the soup kitchen

11:09.794 --> 11:12.713
and he suggested we come down

11:09.794 --> 11:12.713
here and share the magic.

11:13.632 --> 11:14.757
Cute kid.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.219
You want some homemade candy?

11:18.261 --> 11:19.678
MALCOLM:

11:18.261 --> 11:19.678
Dad, everyone's leaving!

11:20.430 --> 11:21.764
Look... whatever St. Mark's

11:21.806 --> 11:23.266
is giving you, we'll double it!

11:23.308 --> 11:25.977
You can double

11:23.308 --> 11:25.977
eternal salvation?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.979
Yes, I can.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.064
You're funny.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.316
(gasps)

11:31.358 --> 11:34.528
So, you sell

11:31.358 --> 11:34.528
Christmas trees?

11:34.569 --> 11:37.696
I used to sell

11:34.569 --> 11:37.696
Christmas trees.

11:45.038 --> 11:45.913
Any luck?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.332
What do you think?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.749
No one's gonna let us

11:47.374 --> 11:48.749
set up our trees.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.126
Unbelievable.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.128
You'd think a cemetery

11:50.168 --> 11:52.128
would be up for anything

11:52.170 --> 11:53.630
that would lighten the mood.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.298
Hey, why don't we just

11:53.672 --> 11:55.298
drive around

11:55.340 --> 11:57.258
and sell the trees out

11:55.340 --> 11:57.258
of the back of the truck?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.801
Of course, we have to factor in

11:57.300 --> 11:58.801
the price of gas.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.471
Let's see, six miles a gallon,

11:58.843 --> 12:01.471
with gas selling at two...

12:01.513 --> 12:03.306
Malcolm, why don't you give

12:01.513 --> 12:03.306
the genius thing

12:03.348 --> 12:05.058
a rest for a while?

12:05.099 --> 12:07.018
We were so close.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.769
89 trees.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.772
Just two trees away

12:08.811 --> 12:11.772
from being profitable.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.608
(sighs)

12:14.067 --> 12:16.570
Story of my life.

12:16.611 --> 12:20.574
No matter what I do,

12:16.611 --> 12:20.574
no matter how hard I try,

12:20.615 --> 12:24.369
I'm always two trees away.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.120
We should just sell them

12:24.411 --> 12:26.120
out of our yard.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.664
Reese, this is

12:26.162 --> 12:27.664
a serious problem.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.790
Would you please just...?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.543
Oh, my God.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.752
That wasn't stupid.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.130
Reese, your love

12:33.794 --> 12:36.130
for your father

12:36.172 --> 12:38.258
has focused your mind

12:36.172 --> 12:38.258
like a laser!

12:38.299 --> 12:39.300
(chuckles)

12:39.342 --> 12:40.759
Give him the hat.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.055
People, there is a squirrel

12:44.097 --> 12:45.806
somewhere in

12:44.097 --> 12:45.806
the store.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.809
He's very agile, elusive,

12:45.848 --> 12:48.809
and possibly rabid,

12:48.851 --> 12:50.061
but we will catch him.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.479
We have to.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.147
I've got a bad feeling

12:51.521 --> 12:53.147
about this, Lois.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.359
It's been too quiet

12:53.189 --> 12:56.359
for too long.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.278
He's planning something.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.697
Yes, well, I brought in

12:58.319 --> 13:00.697
reinforcements, Ethan.

13:00.739 --> 13:01.906
Thanks for

13:00.739 --> 13:01.906
helping, guys.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.824
No problem.

13:03.866 --> 13:04.951
Our last job finished early,

13:04.992 --> 13:06.536
so we had some time

13:04.992 --> 13:06.536
on our hands.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.788
All right then.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.788
Let's do this thing!

13:10.789 --> 13:14.001
♪ ♪

13:39.360 --> 13:41.028
(clanging, banging)

13:43.156 --> 13:45.325
You people are so great!

13:45.366 --> 13:48.995
I'm sorry I ate

13:45.366 --> 13:48.995
all your lunches in the fridge!

13:57.504 --> 13:59.673
You're out there.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.840
I know you're out there.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.512
(footstep crunches)

14:13.394 --> 14:14.354
(gasps)

14:14.395 --> 14:17.607
(screaming)

14:18.941 --> 14:22.445
Aisle 12!

14:18.941 --> 14:22.445
He's heading for the register!

14:27.492 --> 14:28.951
Don't let it get away!

14:28.993 --> 14:30.411
He's over there!

14:30.453 --> 14:32.913
Wait, he's headed for

14:30.453 --> 14:32.913
the front door!

14:32.955 --> 14:35.375
Watch out, he's got murder

14:32.955 --> 14:35.375
in his eyes!

14:35.416 --> 14:37.836
(cries):

14:35.416 --> 14:37.836
And a cute, fluffy tail.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.927
Checkmate, chipmunk.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.932
And three makes ten.

14:51.974 --> 14:52.933
Feliz Navidad.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.310
(chuckles)

14:54.352 --> 14:56.979
So, at $3.50 a foot,

14:54.352 --> 14:56.979
the profit tree is...

14:57.021 --> 15:00.107
112.

14:57.021 --> 15:00.107
112 is

14:57.021 --> 15:00.107
the profit tree.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.192
Say it with me, boys.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.320
"112 is the profit tree."

15:04.362 --> 15:05.905
Hal?

15:05.946 --> 15:07.490
Oh, hey, Phil.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.490
Merry Christmas.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.825
What the hell are

15:07.532 --> 15:08.825
you doing here?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.201
You don't have a

15:08.867 --> 15:10.201
permit to do this.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.078
Get these trees

15:10.243 --> 15:12.078
off your yard.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.955
Phil, please. I...

15:14.997 --> 15:17.291
Look, I know this

15:14.997 --> 15:17.291
seems a little unusual,

15:17.333 --> 15:19.544
but I'm in kind of a jam.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.881
I was laid off,

15:19.586 --> 15:22.881
and I'm out of money.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.884
Come on, it's Christmas.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.760
I don't care.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.928
I hate you,

15:26.801 --> 15:28.928
and I always have.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.013
Phil, why don't you

15:28.969 --> 15:31.013
take a tree?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.139
On the house.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.100
Here.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.894
You're giving me this?

15:35.935 --> 15:36.977
I'll even flock it

15:35.935 --> 15:36.977
if you want.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.063
No, no. That's okay.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.233
So, we have

15:39.105 --> 15:42.233
an understanding here?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.985
Yeah. We have

15:42.275 --> 15:44.985
an understanding.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.905
You're gonna have to get

15:45.027 --> 15:46.905
these trees out of here.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.240
We received a complaint,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.240
and you don't have a permit.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.991
And he has too many

15:49.282 --> 15:50.991
garbage cans.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.993
That's a fineable offense,

15:51.033 --> 15:52.993
isn't it?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.538
He can't complain.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.538
I bribed him with a tree!

15:55.580 --> 15:56.997
Sir, you can't have

15:55.580 --> 15:56.997
a business

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
in your front yard

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
without a permit.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.042
Officer, we've sunk

16:00.084 --> 16:01.544
all our money into this.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.671
We've just got to sell

16:01.586 --> 16:03.671
one more tree to break even.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.674
That's all I'm asking.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.674
One tree.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.927
Just let me sell one tree.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.011
Have you got a tree?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.806
Coming through.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.475
You.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.893
I was never at

16:15.516 --> 16:16.893
that dog show!

16:16.935 --> 16:18.394
And where would

16:16.935 --> 16:18.394
a high school kid

16:18.436 --> 16:19.479
get a spear gun, anyway?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.021
This is your son?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.021
Uh...

16:21.063 --> 16:23.023
Well, it depends on

16:21.063 --> 16:23.023
what you mean by "son."

16:23.065 --> 16:24.275
You got half an hour

16:24.317 --> 16:27.403
to get every single one of these

16:24.317 --> 16:27.403
trees out of your yard.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.738
But we lost our truck!

16:28.780 --> 16:29.697
We don't have any place

16:28.780 --> 16:29.697
to take them.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.031
That's not my problem.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.074
You get them out,

16:32.116 --> 16:35.035
or you'll be spending Christmas

16:32.116 --> 16:35.035
in a jail cell.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.540
(clamoring)

16:39.582 --> 16:40.959
I can't take this.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.043
The yelling,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.043
the screaming...

16:43.085 --> 16:46.046
It's making me feel so...

16:43.085 --> 16:46.046
homesick.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.715
Me, too.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.091
(clamoring continues)

16:49.133 --> 16:52.303
My mom used to grab

16:49.133 --> 16:52.303
my dad's throat like that.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.931
I disown

16:52.345 --> 16:54.931
all of you!

16:54.973 --> 16:56.098
All of you!

16:56.140 --> 16:59.978
I never thought I would

16:56.140 --> 16:59.978
feel ashamed of being German.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.356
(sighs)

17:03.397 --> 17:05.525
Huh. See? Huh?

17:05.566 --> 17:07.067
They're all gone.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.611
Are you happy now?

17:08.653 --> 17:09.988
Just remember,

17:10.029 --> 17:13.073
I'll be patrolling

17:10.029 --> 17:13.073
this block every 15 minutes.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.659
Merry Christmas.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.078
Merry Christmas.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.164
(car engine starts)

17:25.586 --> 17:27.672
(grunting)

17:37.807 --> 17:39.099
I want you to buy me out.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.603
No, Dewey, this is just

17:39.141 --> 17:42.603
a temporary setback.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.147
If you believe that,

17:42.645 --> 17:45.147
then buy me out.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.566
It's over, Dad.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.567
Over?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.109
We're only one tree away!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.987
Dad, we can't get

17:49.151 --> 17:50.987
the truck back.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.363
We can't use

17:51.029 --> 17:52.363
the front lawn.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.114
The cops are

17:52.405 --> 17:54.114
watching us.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.783
Face it, we've lost.

17:55.825 --> 17:59.119
So you're just going to let

17:55.825 --> 17:59.119
a little reality

17:59.161 --> 18:00.454
stop you, is that it?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.373
Boys, let me tell you something.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.044
The only way I've managed

18:02.415 --> 18:06.044
to get through my crappy life

18:06.085 --> 18:10.924
with any shred of self-worth

18:06.085 --> 18:10.924
is by living in denial.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.300
If I was going to let myself

18:10.965 --> 18:13.300
get beaten by failure,

18:13.342 --> 18:15.135
I would've quit

18:13.342 --> 18:15.135
after one kid.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.639
You just got to keep

18:15.177 --> 18:18.639
holding out for a miracle.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.600
And if a miracle isn't

18:18.681 --> 18:20.600
going to come at Christmas,

18:20.641 --> 18:22.142
then when is it

18:20.641 --> 18:22.142
going to come?!

18:22.184 --> 18:24.186
(doorbell rings)

18:24.228 --> 18:26.022
See?! There it is!

18:26.064 --> 18:29.149
Our Christmas miracle!

18:26.064 --> 18:29.149
I knew it!

18:29.191 --> 18:30.234
(laughs)

18:33.905 --> 18:34.822
Hi.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.324
My kid found this cat.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.324
Is it yours?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.953
No. Would you like to buy a

18:37.366 --> 18:39.953
Christmas tree for ten dollars?

18:39.994 --> 18:41.203
No, we already have a tree.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.122
You got to help me out.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.708
I just yanked my boys back

18:43.163 --> 18:45.708
from the brink of despair

18:45.750 --> 18:48.044
and convinced them that life

18:45.750 --> 18:48.044
was worth living.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.046
If you walk away without

18:48.086 --> 18:50.046
handing me ten dollars,

18:50.088 --> 18:52.131
then their futures

18:50.088 --> 18:52.131
aren't worth a damn.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.716
Now, I desperately need

18:52.172 --> 18:53.716
to teach them

18:53.758 --> 18:56.343
the value of perseverance,

18:53.758 --> 18:56.343
and you can help me.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.511
I don't think...

18:57.553 --> 18:59.179
I'll lick your shoes.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.933
Have you ever actually seen

18:59.221 --> 19:01.933
someone do that? I haven't.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.184
That's got to be worth

19:01.975 --> 19:04.184
ten dollars. I'll even...

19:04.226 --> 19:06.353
Here, take the money.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.857
Take it as far

19:07.605 --> 19:09.857
as the sidewalk.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.734
(loudly): Pleasure doing

19:09.899 --> 19:11.734
business with you, sir.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.194
See what happens when

19:11.776 --> 19:14.194
you believe, boys?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.114
We are profitable!

19:16.155 --> 19:19.199
(cheering)

19:19.241 --> 19:22.078
I'm just going to stop

19:19.241 --> 19:22.078
and get Dewey's hamster cage.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.955
That squirrel is chewing

19:22.120 --> 19:23.955
through the box.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.373
Do they really have to kill him

19:23.997 --> 19:26.373
to find out if he has rabies?

19:26.415 --> 19:27.708
Do you want the shots?

19:27.750 --> 19:30.753
Wait for me in heaven.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.382
Oh, my God!

19:35.424 --> 19:37.259
HAL:

19:35.424 --> 19:37.259
Honey, is that you?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.345
What is going on here?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.889
Good news. We did it!

19:41.931 --> 19:43.265
We made a profit.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.976
Really? How much?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.519
Numbers aren't important.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.228
A profit is a profit.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.397
Hey, look, a squirrel.

19:51.273 --> 19:51.983
LOIS:

19:51.273 --> 19:51.983
What?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.820
There he goes!

19:57.237 --> 20:00.533
Squirrel. Gone.

20:00.574 --> 20:04.328
Craig, we will catch him.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.830
All right, here's the deal.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.748
This time, it's ten bucks each

20:07.790 --> 20:09.917
and one item from

20:07.790 --> 20:09.917
the medicine cabinet.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.502
It's gonna be tricky, fellas.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.254
We're on his turf now.

20:18.176 --> 20:21.137
Thanks for spending Christmas

20:18.176 --> 20:21.137
with my relatives.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.930
And next year

20:21.179 --> 20:22.930
we'll do my family.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.306
Marriage is all about

20:22.972 --> 20:24.306
compromise.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.600
PIAMA'S MOM: You think

20:24.348 --> 20:26.600
this house is a pigsty?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.561
(glass shatters)

20:26.642 --> 20:28.561
There, now it's a pigsty!

20:28.602 --> 20:30.021
PIAMA'S DAD:

20:28.602 --> 20:30.021
Oh, you're real brave

20:30.063 --> 20:31.438
when I don't have

20:30.063 --> 20:31.438
my leg strapped on!

20:31.480 --> 20:33.733
They're having all the fun.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.733
We should get in there.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.275
Let's do it.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.737
You know, I feel bad

20:35.317 --> 20:37.737
for Gretchen and Otto.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.655
I hope I didn't

20:37.778 --> 20:39.655
make things worse.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.866
Thank you

20:39.697 --> 20:41.866
for taking us in.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.244
It is nice being with a family

20:41.908 --> 20:45.244
that gets along.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.788
Boy, you guys

20:46.037 --> 20:47.788
really gone out

20:47.830 --> 20:49.082
for this Christmas.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.291
It's even Christmas

20:49.123 --> 20:51.291
in the bathroom!

20:51.333 --> 20:52.585
(laughter)

20:52.626 --> 20:55.671
As Christmases go,

20:52.626 --> 20:55.671
this one was pretty good--

20:55.713 --> 20:57.757
nothing on fire,

20:55.713 --> 20:57.757
no arrests,

20:57.798 --> 21:00.384
and, hell,

20:57.798 --> 21:00.384
we even made a profit.
