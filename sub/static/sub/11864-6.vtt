00:05.422 --> 00:10.582
I went to three Home Depots
to buy toilet seats for Reggie's school.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.795
Jesus Christ.

00:12.929 --> 00:16.879
- Do I have to go to therapy?
- Not if you don't want to.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.934
- Here. Take my picture!
- Why?

00:20.061 --> 00:21.888
Happy thoughts.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.347
For my beautiful young friend.

00:25.483 --> 00:28.687
- I love you, sweetie.
- What are you doing?

00:28.820 --> 00:31.525
Time to shake things up. Piggy-back ride.

00:31.656 --> 00:36.567
- We can't go where they're going!
- Open door's an invitation.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.742
Gotta jump while the door's open!

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:47.756 --> 00:49.962
And she was gone.

00:50.091 --> 00:53.128
I don't understand. Where did she go?

00:53.261 --> 00:55.930
- She's coming back, right?
- I don't know.

00:56.056 --> 01:01.298
Why do I keep losing all the things
and people that I care about?

01:02.520 --> 01:05.093
That's what life is, peanut.

02:08.752 --> 02:10.829
Since the dawn of man,

02:10.964 --> 02:15.756
we've yearned to emulate a bird's ability
to break free from its earthly bonds,

02:15.885 --> 02:18.555
you know, fly like an eagle. Whatever.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.634
You may soar to metaphorical heights,

02:21.766 --> 02:26.309
but none of us really has wings
and gravity never really lets up.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.679
All things come back to earth.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.564
There seems to be
a gravity for relationships, too.

02:33.820 --> 02:38.281
No matter how high they fly,
they always seem to find their way.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.693
Well, they find their way back home.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.375
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

02:55.633 --> 03:00.212
- Have I done something wrong?
- I can't tell. She's not talking to me.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.553
Are you not talking to him?

03:04.059 --> 03:06.384
Oh, bloody hell.

03:13.151 --> 03:17.398
- Diet Coke, chipped ice, but not too much.
- I think this is about Betty.

03:17.530 --> 03:23.900
I think George has somehow
implicated me in Betty's disappearance.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.699
- Am I right or am I right?
- Can you pass me the ketchup?

03:28.833 --> 03:32.498
- How you doing?
- I don't think so.

03:32.629 --> 03:36.627
That's all you want, the ketchup?
'Cause ketchup I can handle.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.878
But the guilt trip about Betty, that I cannot.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.383
I don't know where Betty is.

03:42.514 --> 03:47.970
- Erm, hello, I'm Mason.
- I don't... think so.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.476
- What does that mean?
- She hates you.

03:51.606 --> 03:55.271
I'm sorry about your friend.
Reapers come and go - that's life.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.893
I missed Betty like crazy.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.481
I had 1,001 questions
and I didn't know where to begin.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.783
Where was she? Was she OK?
Was she coming back?

04:04.911 --> 04:07.319
What did Rube know?

04:07.455 --> 04:13.410
Somebody had to ask him these questions.
Hopefully, that person will be along soon.

04:13.545 --> 04:17.839
- This isn't chipped ice.
- All we've got is cubes.

04:17.966 --> 04:22.129
Well, if you have cubes and an ice pick,
then you have chipped.

04:22.262 --> 04:26.094
- Do you, Casey, have an ice pick?
- Yeah. A nice one.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.929
Well, then, I think we need to start over.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.098
You see that Diet Coke? That's on me.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.687
- I'm Mason.
- You're a fucking moron.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.352
- Is your name Rube?
- It is.

04:39.487 --> 04:43.865
- Well, I'm Daisy. Daisy Adair.
- You're two days early, Daisy Adair.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.234
Well, aren't you lucky?

04:48.955 --> 04:51.576
This is Mason. As we know.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.955
And this is George.
Daisy's one of us. Daisy's a reaper.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.376
George. Is that your given name?

04:58.506 --> 05:02.753
- Georgia.
- That's much prettier. I'll call you Georgia.

05:02.886 --> 05:06.337
I hated her instantly,
with all my guts.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.390
- What is she doing here?
- She was transferred.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.925
- From?
- New York. SoHo.

05:12.062 --> 05:17.056
- Why were you transferred?
- Well, that's kind of personal.

05:17.192 --> 05:21.735
- One Diet Coke, chipped ice.
- Thank you so much, Casey.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.991
So, Daisy...
Now, seriously, that Diet Coke is on me.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.071
Agh!

05:31.206 --> 05:34.539
Excuse me, Miss, I need a refill.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.918
I hated her a little less.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.757
Oh. I'll come back.

05:45.887 --> 05:49.837
- You just came in.
- Forget about it, I'll go downstairs.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.806
Wanna take a bath?
There's plenty of room in here.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.721
Um, I'm grading papers. I just had to pee.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.064
I'll give you your privacy.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.351
You never used to be pee-shy.

06:03.738 --> 06:08.863
You can't talk to me.
Barely make eye contact with me.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.236
Where are you, Clancy?

06:12.372 --> 06:16.322
I'm in the middle of grading papers, Joy.
That's where I am.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.368
Good luck with that.

06:18.503 --> 06:23.498
- I have got 20 papers to read. They all suck.
- Reggie's principal called.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.430
What? Is she stealing more toilet seats?

06:30.557 --> 06:36.180
Just a routine call, he said. Whenever
a student has three absences in a row.

06:36.312 --> 06:39.017
Wanted to know if Reggie was better.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.814
- Reggie hasn't been sick.
- No.

06:42.944 --> 06:48.069
Not fever, runny nose, stuffy head,
can't-get-out-of-bed sick.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.983
- Where the hell's she going?
- To therapy.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.248
Don't you think that
we ought to talk to her, before...?

06:56.374 --> 06:59.577
We? As in you, who's never here,

06:59.711 --> 07:03.791
and me, whose lap
all this crap gets dumped on?

07:06.009 --> 07:09.259
In. You dump something in your lap.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.878
Are you gonna pee or what?

07:18.355 --> 07:21.889
This was the first time
I'd lived alone. I liked it.

07:22.025 --> 07:26.687
At first it was a little too quiet,
but then the quiet became my friend.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.162
Georgia? It's Daisy, Daisy Adair.

07:36.289 --> 07:40.868
- Fuck me.
- I heard that! Open the door, Georgia.

07:44.923 --> 07:48.173
- Evening, roomie.
- What do you mean, "roomie"?

07:48.301 --> 07:51.255
Rube said I should bunk with you

07:51.388 --> 07:54.721
till I find something more... suitable.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.387
Here. It's a housewarming/thank you gift.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.267
- Wood chips?
- No, silly goose, it's potpourri.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.521
It's English Garden.

08:04.567 --> 08:08.897
You're not quite ready for home accents.
Haven't had time to decorate.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.031
It's sort of low on my list of priorities.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.244
You collecting bodies
as well as souls here?

08:24.421 --> 08:28.714
- Oh, Raoul. Poor, stupid thing.
- Raoul?

08:28.842 --> 08:32.791
Homeless gentleman.
Drunk as a sailor but strong upper body.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.760
You know, Daisy,
this is a pretty small apartment.

08:36.890 --> 08:40.260
It really is. Here is the fiver we discussed.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.431
And one cocktail. Ready?

08:46.609 --> 08:48.685
Whoo! Sorry.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.358
I treasure the time we spent together

08:51.489 --> 08:55.569
but you and your smelly self
really must be going.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.244
Whee!

08:57.370 --> 09:02.365
- Mason, be a doll and fetch me that handbag.
- Anything for you, gorgeous.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.952
Was this whole bunking thing
really Rube's idea?

09:06.087 --> 09:08.543
'Cause I don't see him doing that to me.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.793
Georgia, if I may be so inquisitive,
how did you die?

09:11.926 --> 09:15.841
- Why do you ask?
- Well, you seem a little irritated.

09:15.972 --> 09:20.515
I got hit by a toilet seat
that fell from the Soviet space station.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.973
Oh, my God, you're Toilet Seat Girl?
No wonder you're so annoyed!

09:25.106 --> 09:29.685
- Well, I guess we're both famous.
- Well, Daisy, how did you die?

09:29.819 --> 09:33.651
During the making of Gone With The Wind.
I am an actress.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.858
- No way.
- Yes, siree.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.234
Things had been going very well.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.703
The star of the movie and I
had become quite the item.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.287
Hang on. You and Clark Gable?

09:44.417 --> 09:47.204
I was young and didn't know what I was doing.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.744
- Sounds like you did.
- No, I didn't.

09:49.881 --> 09:54.009
I was under the table,
blowing this tall, handsome man

09:54.135 --> 09:58.844
and someone leaned over and whispered
in my ear, "No, that's Clark Gable."

09:58.973 --> 10:01.262
So who were you blowing?

10:01.393 --> 10:05.686
I don't know! It's such a huge cast.
Someone from the confederacy, I think.

10:05.814 --> 10:09.811
But enough about me. Let's talk about
where I'm putting my stuff.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.483
What's happening at school today?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.568
I don't know. Wednesday.

10:17.701 --> 10:22.576
- What is Wednesday? Art or music?
- Gym.

10:22.706 --> 10:27.332
Well, don't you think
you should wear your... tennis shoes?

10:27.460 --> 10:31.209
- They're too tight.
- They fit you just fine.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.715
- So, art was yesterday?
- Mm-hm.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.920
Oh. Did you bring it home?

10:39.889 --> 10:44.053
No. I didn't... It wasn't dry yet.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.804
Oh. OK. I'd really love to see it.

10:47.939 --> 10:51.522
Mr Schiffer wants
to put them up in the classroom.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.522
Reggie, I need to ask you something.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.817
What do you want for breakfast?

11:09.836 --> 11:14.297
- I have to brush my teeth.
- Ocupado!

11:16.760 --> 11:21.885
Do you work for a living?
Because I do and I have to be there on time.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.886
That sounds dreadful.

11:26.019 --> 11:30.764
You know, Daisy, I have a job.
I mean, what do you do?

11:32.609 --> 11:37.022
I'm going to buy the New York Times,
since you don't have it delivered.

11:37.155 --> 11:42.315
Then I'm going to have a green tea and
a muffin and then look for a sweater set.

11:42.452 --> 11:46.948
This afternoon, if I'm so obligated,
I'm going to collect someone's soul.

11:47.082 --> 11:52.621
And if I look really pretty when I'm doing it,
good for me. That's what I do, Georgia.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.422
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- No.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.224
- I have time.
- I like to walk.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.840
OK. Well, have a great day.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.585
# A-boom ba

12:35.422 --> 12:37.580
# A-boom ba

12:39.384 --> 12:41.460
# A-boom ba

12:43.388 --> 12:45.511
# A-boom ba

12:48.351 --> 12:50.143
# A-boom ba

12:50.270 --> 12:53.970
- # Can you hear my heart beat in this hurt?
- # A-boom ba

12:54.107 --> 12:57.939
- # Do you know that behind of this hurt
- # A-boom ba

12:58.069 --> 13:02.019
# Lies the deep desire I'm in love, hey

13:02.157 --> 13:05.608
# Make a wonderful love if I may

13:09.247 --> 13:11.156
# A-boom ba

13:11.291 --> 13:15.205
# Can you hear my heart beat in this hurt?

13:15.337 --> 13:17.376
# Do you know that behind... #

13:17.505 --> 13:19.581
Jesus fucking Christ!

13:19.716 --> 13:22.468
# Lies the deep desire I'm in love, hey

13:22.594 --> 13:26.592
# Make a wonderful love if I may #

13:31.853 --> 13:34.522
I think I can handle this myself.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.811
When I saw you kicking it
I figured you might need some help.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.731
We have a call-out service on this machine.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.107
What happened to you?

13:46.242 --> 13:49.446
- I slept funny.
- You need a body pillow.

13:49.579 --> 13:53.873
I bought mine when I thought
I was pregnant. I sleep like a baby.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.491
Aha! There's the bandit.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.917
Well! I guess we'll keep you.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.834
She'll hold together for another day.

14:01.966 --> 14:06.296
Does Information Services know they have
a Renaissance man on their hands?

14:06.429 --> 14:10.094
"The geeks shall inherit the earth."

14:11.351 --> 14:14.802
I'm sure you've heard
Jimmy's being transferred.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.773
- What?!
- I wasn't even consulted.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.975
Really chaps my hide.

14:20.110 --> 14:25.151
Is Jimmy the guy with the lunch box
from Data Processing?

14:25.281 --> 14:28.900
- That's Jim.
- Jimmy, in Supply Distribution.

14:29.035 --> 14:33.163
- Lanky. Sideburns unequal lengths.
- Has a spastic colon or something.

14:33.289 --> 14:37.667
- This is a nightmare.
- Don't panic. We will survive this.

14:37.794 --> 14:43.133
- Oh! The guy who orders the highlighters.
- And bowls a 210.

14:44.926 --> 14:49.138
If 15-30 hours a week
of tedious tasks wasn't enough,

14:49.264 --> 14:52.763
the Happy Time Cobras
were always an option.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.643
You're hot tonight, Jimmy! Whoo-hoo!

15:04.279 --> 15:08.739
- You don't bowl, do you, Millie?
- No. Uh-uh.

15:08.867 --> 15:14.288
When I had my cocaine problem,
bowling helped in ways you cannot imagine.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.534
- Russ could play.
- No, Russ is a showboat.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.665
- His handicap is single digits.
- He's a P-R-I-C-K, Michael.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.168
It's a quality-of-life issue.

15:24.299 --> 15:28.925
- You never bowled?
- You know, when I was a kid.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.636
Marty's good.
It's just a matter of wheelchair access.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.683
My gut says Millie may be our answer.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.803
- What?
- We'll make it work.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.437
A team isn't the sum of its parts,
it's a karma thing.

15:41.566 --> 15:46.987
Remember Sahid and how
he screwed us over? Punjab motherfucker.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.818
I've made my decision. Let the others know.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.825
Delores...
Delores, I'm not joining the bowling team.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.706
It's not about you, sweetie.

15:58.958 --> 16:03.585
Then why am I feeling like
it's going to be me who's renting the shoes?

16:03.713 --> 16:06.251
It's about your substance abuse problem.

16:06.383 --> 16:10.594
Ah, the rehab lie,
back to bite me in the ass again.

16:10.720 --> 16:15.928
Think of it as two and a half hours a week
where you won't think about sucking blow

16:16.059 --> 16:19.594
through a bendy straw
of a fast-food rest-room sink.

16:27.946 --> 16:33.071
What's with you?
Hey. Is there a new cook in the kitchen?

16:34.119 --> 16:36.277
No.

16:36.413 --> 16:41.751
- Over easy was... uneasy today.
- You want more eggs?

16:41.876 --> 16:46.123
No, I was looking at curing the disease,
not the symptoms. Forget it.

16:47.882 --> 16:52.010
- How are you lovebirds?
- It was brilliant to throw us in the same pot.

16:52.137 --> 16:56.134
Georgia here,
she's sweeter than a harvest peach.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.472
What happened to your neck?

16:58.601 --> 17:02.469
Well, I didn't have a... pillow last night.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.179
We'll work it all out, won't we, sweetie?

17:06.108 --> 17:08.481
Who was complaining about the eggs?

17:08.611 --> 17:12.692
- Oh, no complaints, just observations.
- Such as?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.573
The eggs are not good.

17:16.703 --> 17:21.281
It's normally a moot point
at the à la carte price of $2.95.

17:21.415 --> 17:26.327
I love eggs. I love 'em fried, scrambled,
boiled, Florentine. These I didn't love.

17:26.463 --> 17:29.250
So who do we blame, the hen or the cook?

17:32.719 --> 17:35.673
Let's blame the hen.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.054
He's a nice guy.

17:40.185 --> 17:44.313
Peanut, why don't you tag along
with our leading lady today?

17:44.439 --> 17:48.104
I really don't think
I need a chaperone any more.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.523
I know. But she does.

17:53.531 --> 17:58.489
"Obsessed with toiletries." Do you mean
cosmetics, personal hygiene items?

17:58.620 --> 18:01.241
She's obsessed with a toilet tree.

18:01.373 --> 18:04.955
A tree. Full of toilet seats.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.326
OK. Good.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.340
George was killed by a toilet seat.

18:15.512 --> 18:19.426
- You miss your sister?
- I was told there'd be cookies.

18:19.557 --> 18:24.184
Mary Wolpert went to a shrink and
there were Fig Newtons and hot chocolate.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.017
I'm sorry, Reggie, we don't do that here.

18:27.148 --> 18:30.932
Do I have to set my house on fire for a snack?

18:31.069 --> 18:33.986
How does your family
honour Georgia's memory?

18:34.114 --> 18:36.190
We had a funeral, of course.

18:36.324 --> 18:39.111
And when the headstone is ready,

18:39.244 --> 18:42.992
I'll guess we'll, you know, put it on her... grave.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.696
Reggie, it's not yours. Put that down.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.037
It's OK. You like to play
with your sister's things?

18:50.213 --> 18:53.333
Did your sister not let you touch her stuff?

18:55.093 --> 18:58.841
- She packed 'em all up.
- Just... clothes!

18:59.889 --> 19:03.970
- Books. Odds and ends.
- The rest you sold at a yard sale.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.723
I'm supposed to save every scrap?

19:06.855 --> 19:10.058
You must have photos of George in the house.

19:12.318 --> 19:17.395
Objects that serve as reminders help us
to remember stories and invite questions.

19:17.532 --> 19:20.948
Reggie steals toilet seats
and brings home dead animals.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.411
Do you think slapping up photos
is gonna stop that?

19:24.539 --> 19:28.916
I think it would be more productive
if I talked to Reggie alone today.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.413
Fine.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.859
- Are you here to see Dr Plotkin?
- You mean Dr Hanson?

19:59.991 --> 20:04.404
Right, Hanson. Plotkin's my podiatrist.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.704
Don't know why
I was thinking about Plotkin.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.406
Must have been staring at my foot.

20:10.543 --> 20:14.707
- Are you here to see Dr Hanson?
- I've got the next appointment.

20:14.839 --> 20:18.884
- She's a child psychologist.
- Inner child.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.302
Excuse me.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.814
- Do you have the correct time?
- It's five after two.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.906
Thank you.

20:48.623 --> 20:54.128
If you don't mind me prying,
why is your child seeing a psychologist?

20:54.254 --> 20:58.501
Her sister's... sudden death
has traumatised her.

21:00.343 --> 21:04.637
She's been unable to...
too stubborn to move on.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.548
I just don't get
our culture's obsession with moving on.

21:08.685 --> 21:13.347
I mean, what are we afraid of?
Being sad? Remembering?

21:13.481 --> 21:17.609
Are you familiar with
the talking-drum people of Nigeria?

21:17.736 --> 21:21.947
- No.
- They do this dance...

21:22.073 --> 21:27.150
Man, it is... it is something.

21:27.287 --> 21:32.198
.. where they invite their ancestors
into their bodies.

21:32.334 --> 21:35.453
And they dance as if they were them.

21:35.587 --> 21:39.454
You got young girls dancing like... old men.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.461
You got boys dancing like grandmothers.

21:44.095 --> 21:48.638
And believe me, it is...
it is anything but sad.

21:58.193 --> 22:04.029
I'm supposed to be meeting someone here.
You wouldn't know a person called...?

22:05.075 --> 22:09.368
Is there any way to get that pure water
delivered to one's home?

22:09.496 --> 22:13.410
- Just call 555 THIRSTY.
- You got a card?

22:13.541 --> 22:17.076
Oh, thank you. You're a lifesaver.

22:17.212 --> 22:20.628
Norman. What's your last name?
So you get the commission.

22:20.757 --> 22:25.218
- Plotkin, but we don't work on commission.
- Oh, I guess it doesn't matter.

22:32.352 --> 22:37.228
Good luck with your daughter. Dance with
her sometime. Conjure up the old spirits.

23:23.403 --> 23:28.065
Who's your mama?

23:28.199 --> 23:32.411
Live it! Yeah! Baby!

23:32.537 --> 23:34.613
Whoo-hoo!

23:34.748 --> 23:37.286
OK, George, ready to bowl?

23:38.460 --> 23:40.701
Let's go and get you some shoes.

23:40.837 --> 23:44.206
OK, size seven and a half and a kid's one.

23:46.593 --> 23:49.677
- They smell funny.
- That's bowling.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.130
It's all hot inside.

23:52.265 --> 23:56.014
Yeah, the kid who wore those last
was really fat.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.558
I'll take 'em.

23:59.689 --> 24:02.939
Yee! Hi, Millie!

24:03.068 --> 24:05.475
You know everybody, right?

24:05.612 --> 24:08.103
- Hey.
- Hi, Millie.

24:08.239 --> 24:11.157
Where's your ball, dear?

24:11.284 --> 24:13.277
Oh. I didn't bring it.

24:15.789 --> 24:20.996
OK. Well... how about
we go pick you out one?

24:21.127 --> 24:23.618
Karen, you can work on
your cross-alley throw.

24:26.174 --> 24:29.424
- How do you misplace a ball?
- She doesn't have one.

24:29.552 --> 24:31.841
Fuck! We're gonna get our asses kicked.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.634
It's not gonna pick you.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.391
Why don't you get a feel for one?

24:44.401 --> 24:49.905
- I have a black ebonite Omega LM.
- I like green.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.998
- Who's up?
- Delores, we know you mean well...

25:06.131 --> 25:10.045
- You've never steered us wrong.
- But she's gonna ruin everything.

25:10.176 --> 25:14.506
- Is this some kind of coup?
- Your pins are one point each, too.

25:14.639 --> 25:18.257
- We don't want her to play.
- Excuse me.

25:19.394 --> 25:24.768
It seemed the most important rule
of my life was equally valuable in death:

25:24.899 --> 25:26.975
quit before you're fired.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.858
- I can just keep score.
- No! No. Really?

25:30.989 --> 25:34.607
I bet you can
still get your shoe-money back.

25:44.461 --> 25:46.702
Peace at last.

25:47.797 --> 25:51.380
Maybe Daisy was out
blowing the rich and famous.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.668
Well! You are late.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.638
- I was going to...
- Going to...?

25:56.765 --> 26:00.809
I can't sleep on that chair again, Daisy.

26:00.935 --> 26:04.470
I know. I felt absolutely awful about that.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.978
- And...
- And...?

26:07.108 --> 26:09.860
Someone went on a tear at the mall today

26:09.986 --> 26:14.114
and guess who purchased you
your very own pillow?

26:15.325 --> 26:17.946
Remember when we first talked

26:18.078 --> 26:21.862
we said we were going to...
share the bed?

26:21.998 --> 26:25.497
- We were going to switch off.
- Switch off?

26:25.627 --> 26:28.747
The bed. You said we were going to switch.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.956
Good God.

26:31.091 --> 26:35.338
It's as if your tongue
is just flapping loose in your mouth.

26:35.470 --> 26:38.341
- Didn't anyone ever teach you diction?
- Um...

26:38.473 --> 26:43.894
Switch.
"The witches switch swatches." Say it.

26:45.313 --> 26:48.812
- I...
- The witches switch swatches.

26:48.942 --> 26:53.438
- Say it three times fast.
- The witches switch swatches.

26:53.571 --> 26:57.439
Almost whistle that "sw".
The witches switch swatches.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.245
- The witches switch swatches.
- Faster.

27:00.370 --> 27:03.821
The witches switch swatches.
The witches switch swatches.

27:03.957 --> 27:09.200
There, that's the way! Oh, George,
you're such a quick study. Good for you.

27:09.337 --> 27:13.382
We'll work on it again tomorrow.
Nighty-night.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.918
OK, good night.

27:19.097 --> 27:24.092
Maybe some day, when computers get
big enough and can keep track of the universe,

27:24.269 --> 27:26.724
we'll see that everything balances out.

27:35.864 --> 27:38.651
For every death, there is a birth,

27:38.783 --> 27:41.535
for every tear spilled, there's a smile.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.908
Stop joining teams, Russ,
you're running out of room.

27:47.042 --> 27:51.834
I'm temping at three different places
and each one's got a bowling team.

27:54.132 --> 27:56.753
You make up your mind yet?

27:56.885 --> 27:59.636
No, not yet. What's popular?

27:59.763 --> 28:03.677
Anything patriotic.
Uncle Sam, Statue of Liberty.

28:04.934 --> 28:09.596
One lady wanted the World Trade Center,
tower on each cheek. Go figure.

28:09.731 --> 28:12.518
- What's that bloke getting?
- Cobra.

28:12.650 --> 28:16.814
- Yeah? Mind if I come and look?
- Be my guest.

28:22.202 --> 28:25.156
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Very nice work.

28:27.916 --> 28:32.412
Listen, I can't really decide what I want,
so I'll come back.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.621
OK.

28:42.013 --> 28:45.180
- It's a very pretty flower.
- He gave me an iris.

28:45.308 --> 28:48.724
- It doesn't matter to me.
- I'm the one with it on my ass.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.391
Willy, I'll change my name to Iris.

28:51.523 --> 28:55.105
We wouldn't be Willy and Lily then,
would we?

28:55.235 --> 28:59.778
I asked for a lily and
this shit-for-brains gave me a fucking iris!

29:00.949 --> 29:03.522
Tattoo this, asshole!

29:16.840 --> 29:19.591
One day you're here, the next you're not.

29:19.718 --> 29:23.762
- Shit! Delores, you scared me.
- Are you all right?

29:23.888 --> 29:27.637
Yeah, I just didn't know anyone was here.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.258
It's 10pm. What are you doing here?

29:31.730 --> 29:34.849
Well, I can't really... go home.

29:35.900 --> 29:40.147
I... was just doing some... filing.

29:41.197 --> 29:45.740
I understand. I've been... filing, too.

29:45.869 --> 29:48.573
It's hard to know where to put this.

29:50.874 --> 29:55.785
- Yeah.
- I never even got to see him bowl.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.503
I heard he bowled a perfect game once.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.709
Did he? Damn!

30:03.136 --> 30:07.597
Well, he's bowling for another team now.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.385
Yes. He is.

30:12.520 --> 30:17.182
You know, I think his cubicle
is a little bigger than mine.

30:17.317 --> 30:19.523
'Cause it's filled with love.

30:20.570 --> 30:24.069
You wanna steal something, don't you?

30:24.199 --> 30:27.153
- What?
- Do you want his mug?

30:28.328 --> 30:31.827
- Uh, no, that's creepy.
- Why?

30:31.956 --> 30:35.408
Everybody needs to steal
a bit of someone they love.

30:35.543 --> 30:38.877
- I hardly knew him.
- You shared an office.

30:39.005 --> 30:44.296
Drank from the same water cooler.
Stood under the same fluorescent lights.

30:45.512 --> 30:48.429
- Take something.
- I have a mug.

30:48.556 --> 30:52.969
Well, it can be anything.
What reminds you of Russ?

30:53.103 --> 30:56.685
Just a piece of that somebody
in remembrance,

30:56.815 --> 31:01.026
a tangible connection
to who that person was to you.

31:02.070 --> 31:04.987
I took that little quartz duck he had.

31:05.115 --> 31:08.151
That just screamed "Russ" to me.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.960
God damn, she's selling my shit!

31:31.641 --> 31:33.598
OK.

31:43.486 --> 31:46.523
- I'll take this.
- His monitor squeegee.

31:46.656 --> 31:52.611
- Yeah. Russ's... monitor squeegee.
- Oh, that is so Russ!

31:55.248 --> 31:57.324
OK. Uh...

32:43.838 --> 32:50.173
Daisy's like an oil spill that just keeps
creeping further and further into my life.

32:50.303 --> 32:53.506
- OK.
- I haven't really slept in two days.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.760
- It's your apartment, right?
- Tell her that.

33:01.523 --> 33:03.765
- You tell her.
- She doesn't listen.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.643
You're not speaking loud enough.

33:05.777 --> 33:09.857
You didn't get me a place.
Why did you tell her to stay with me?

33:09.989 --> 33:13.904
- I hoped you'd hit it off.
- I'd like to hit her.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.953
- Can't you just talk to her?
- All right, fine.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.907
Really?

33:23.712 --> 33:29.880
No. I'm not getting between two women
fighting over some crappy apartment.

33:30.010 --> 33:33.628
My crappy apartment. Mine.
Who does she think she is?

33:33.805 --> 33:36.806
She thinks she's someone.
She senses you don't.

33:36.933 --> 33:41.145
- I don't think she's someone?
- That you don't think you're someone.

33:41.271 --> 33:46.811
You wanna be a bowling pin your whole life
and be knocked down again and again?

33:46.943 --> 33:49.019
Or would you rather be the ball?

33:49.154 --> 33:53.483
I gotta tell you,
being the ball feels a hell of a lot better.

33:57.162 --> 33:58.822
Yes!

34:00.123 --> 34:03.706
- Daisy's a ball, you're a pin.
- I am not.

34:03.835 --> 34:06.955
Whatever you say, peanut.
You're not a pin.

34:09.424 --> 34:12.259
Play another. You can get back at me.

34:19.976 --> 34:22.384
Pin therapy.

34:25.148 --> 34:28.351
Nice way to work out a little aggression.

34:58.306 --> 35:00.382
I want these.

35:00.517 --> 35:03.553
- They're not gonna fit.
- Yes, they will.

35:03.687 --> 35:07.518
- See? They're too tight.
- I don't care.

35:19.452 --> 35:23.117
The Cotonio Memorial
Bowling Tournament?

35:23.248 --> 35:27.376
We placed second
in the mother-daughter competition.

35:27.502 --> 35:29.578
You and George?

35:33.216 --> 35:37.925
- She blew that last frame.
- I never saw George bowl.

35:38.054 --> 35:42.716
She was a great athlete.
But your sister didn't like team sports.

36:01.161 --> 36:03.830
I am not a fucking pin.

36:04.664 --> 36:07.535
Hm. What do you know?

36:08.710 --> 36:13.538
Daisy? Listen, I have
some things I wanna say to you.

36:13.673 --> 36:17.374
You can't just move your shit
into my apartment

36:17.510 --> 36:21.010
and kick me out of my own bed...

36:25.894 --> 36:28.895
I never, ever get a break.

36:30.023 --> 36:36.026
My mother abandoned me,
my... father was never a father.

36:38.073 --> 36:43.826
I never really had a real home
or even a place that I felt like I belonged.

36:43.953 --> 36:46.361
Why can't I belong?

36:46.498 --> 36:49.119
Why can't you accept me?

36:53.672 --> 36:56.044
I just want you to...

36:57.759 --> 37:00.048
.. hold me.

37:02.222 --> 37:07.678
This life has been a collection of...
disappointments and...

37:08.728 --> 37:10.804
.. heartache.

37:15.068 --> 37:17.144
And... scene!

37:18.238 --> 37:22.615
".. a collection of problems,
disillusionment and unhappiness."

37:22.742 --> 37:25.150
Why do I always mutilate that line?

37:25.286 --> 37:28.537
Will you be a doll and help me learn my lines?

37:28.665 --> 37:34.205
Please don't be afraid to stop me
if I'm even off by one syllable. OK?

37:35.588 --> 37:39.586
OK. And... action.

37:44.806 --> 37:47.558
Why can I never get a break?

37:51.855 --> 37:54.606
Reggie, it's time for bed.

37:56.651 --> 37:59.273
Jesus Christ.

38:01.281 --> 38:05.444
Reggie, we talked about
unpacking a few of George's things.

38:05.577 --> 38:09.657
We didn't talk about
turning your bedroom into a holy shrine.

38:09.789 --> 38:13.241
- It's not.
- This is not a shrine?

38:14.544 --> 38:16.169
No.

38:17.339 --> 38:19.746
It's my room.

38:26.931 --> 38:30.347
- Mom?
- Yes, Reggie?

38:32.103 --> 38:34.179
Get out.

39:05.303 --> 39:07.462
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

39:09.683 --> 39:13.182
- They're ahead by nine pins.
- Nine to tie, ten to win.

39:13.311 --> 39:17.225
You do the best you can.
That's all that matters.

39:24.906 --> 39:27.942
This is exactly
why I never joined a team.

39:28.076 --> 39:32.156
Bullshit camaraderie
leads to bullshit pressure.

39:34.916 --> 39:39.245
Come on, Millie!
A strike and we beat these motherfuckers.

39:39.379 --> 39:42.546
Oh, crap! Did I TiVo Iron Chef?

39:42.674 --> 39:46.921
Should we go to Chili's later?
I could suck back some ribs.

39:47.053 --> 39:51.881
Miss. Miss. Miss. She's kinda hot.

39:52.934 --> 39:57.762
And bullshit pressure
builds to a moment of paralysing fear.

39:57.897 --> 40:03.140
It's bizarre what goes through your head,
standing frozen in a moment of sheer panic.

40:03.278 --> 40:06.314
And my thought was "Why did I die?"

40:06.448 --> 40:09.117
Or more to the point, "Why didn't I live?"

40:10.660 --> 40:16.034
Why didn't I move? Why did
I just stand there like a bowling pin?

40:19.794 --> 40:22.464
Cotonio Memorial
Bowling Tournament

40:24.966 --> 40:28.964
What made me so dead set
against having an experience?

40:29.095 --> 40:32.844
Why didn't I talk to
the people who liked me?

40:41.149 --> 40:45.016
Why didn't I ever talk to my little sister?

40:46.905 --> 40:50.274
Why didn't I live when I could have?

40:54.120 --> 40:56.790
Aw, shit!

41:36.538 --> 41:38.863
- You did it!
- I did it!

41:45.839 --> 41:49.172
I felt something
I had never felt before.

41:49.300 --> 41:53.381
A hand on my ass.
Who the hell was cupping my ass?

41:53.513 --> 41:56.182
Probably that perv from IS.

41:57.851 --> 42:01.101
Oh, God, I hope it was that perv from IS.

42:02.272 --> 42:04.845
I also felt something else,

42:04.983 --> 42:09.277
that in some strange, undead way,
I was alive.

42:09.404 --> 42:11.776
I was flying.

43:03.083 --> 43:05.159
