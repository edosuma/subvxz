00:39.300 --> 00:44.900
THE GREY
Subtitle: Szaki & LaDa

01:18.360 --> 01:20.553
A job at the end of the world.

01:25.177 --> 01:28.600
A salary killer for a big
petroleum company.

01:31.137 --> 01:34.200
I don't know why I did half
the things I've done,

01:35.273 --> 01:37.200
but I know this is where I belong.

01:38.854 --> 01:41.000
Surrounded by my own.

01:42.359 --> 01:43.780
Ex-cons,

01:43.828 --> 01:46.004
fugitives, drifters,

01:47.130 --> 01:48.410
assholes.

01:49.930 --> 01:52.330
Men unfit for mankind.

02:42.266 --> 02:45.194
There's not a second goes by
when I'm not thinking of you in some way.

02:51.359 --> 02:52.985
I want to see your face,

02:54.534 --> 02:56.690
feel your hands in mine,

02:58.262 --> 02:59.690
feel you against me.

03:06.101 --> 03:08.110
But I know that will never be.

03:09.446 --> 03:11.030
You left me,

03:13.347 --> 03:15.270
and I can't get you back.

03:18.789 --> 03:21.159
I move like I imagine the damned do,

03:22.848 --> 03:24.233
cursed.

03:29.004 --> 03:31.130
And I feel like it's only a matter of time.

03:44.790 --> 03:47.130
I don't know why I'm writing this,

03:48.430 --> 03:50.650
I don't know what can come of it.

04:00.221 --> 04:02.050
I know I can't get you back.

04:42.797 --> 04:45.470
I don't know why this has
happened to us.

04:47.392 --> 04:49.270
I feel like it's me,

04:50.354 --> 04:51.810
bad luck...

04:52.426 --> 04:53.870
poison.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.230
And I've stopped doing this
world any real good.

05:52.410 --> 05:54.770
Once more into the fray.

06:00.930 --> 06:04.210
Into the last good fight
I'll ever know.

06:34.850 --> 06:36.050
Live...

06:36.952 --> 06:39.570
and die on this day.

06:49.757 --> 06:50.857
Live...

06:52.050 --> 06:53.170
and die...

06:55.385 --> 06:56.970
on this day.

07:07.304 --> 07:09.524
Let’s go. Idents
and boarding passes please.

07:11.190 --> 07:13.273
Please have them out
there’s a storm coming in

07:13.474 --> 07:15.310
We gotta get this plane
off the tarmac.

07:16.930 --> 07:19.170
Guys are fucking this up, let’s go.

07:53.277 --> 07:54.910
Shit, sorry bro.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.250
Sorry man, sorry.

08:15.136 --> 08:18.010
It is as cold as this mother-
fucker has ever been, huh?

08:18.870 --> 08:23.070
I ain't shitting either, man. I stripped down for
the shower and icicles are formed on my nuts.

08:24.382 --> 08:26.630
I didn't even think that shit was possible.

08:26.710 --> 08:29.190
- You got a girl back in Anchorage?
- No.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.832
Oh, well. I got me a few.
Went out to get the scrape.

08:36.202 --> 08:37.890
At least that’s what she told me.

08:38.205 --> 08:40.280
She’s been hitting me up
for the money ever since.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.600
I’m like: ”Bitch, we both fucked”

08:43.671 --> 08:45.400
„I'll split it with you, whatever.„

08:45.620 --> 08:47.620
I'am Flannery, by the way...
Todd.

08:47.762 --> 08:50.540
- You're Aman, right?
- Ottway.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.860
Oh, opps! Sorry bro. Ottway, yeah.

08:52.900 --> 08:56.380
So, you blast critters for a living, huh?
You do some of that snipe issue.

08:56.420 --> 08:58.820
What's the biggest piece of game
you've taken down? Like a kodiak?

08:59.060 --> 09:02.780
You know, I saw that documentary
that asshole did. You know, the fag who loves bears...

09:02.820 --> 09:04.420
Listen. Listen pal. I don't wanna talk.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.660
I need some quiet. So I'm just
gonna put head back, okay?

09:09.300 --> 09:11.500
Yeah, that's cool. That's cool.

09:23.500 --> 09:27.060
- Sir, sir, I need you sit down, please.
- Yeah, I am sitting.

09:45.470 --> 09:47.470
- You like that chick?
- No, I don’t. - Yeah, you do.

09:49.007 --> 09:52.827
Just really never you can seriously say,
not only does it make you impotent

09:53.053 --> 09:56.053
but it poisons you,
and it causes some skin rashes.

09:57.404 --> 09:58.474
- No, it’s the opposite.
- Whatever.

09:59.505 --> 10:00.475
Dude.

10:00.735 --> 10:02.055
- Was it?
- Plus it tastes like shit.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.342
Did you ever taste that?

10:04.377 --> 10:05.697
You ever seen one?

10:07.698 --> 10:13.074
- What's the other thing?
- …Not, not into it, not into it. Incontinent.

10:17.405 --> 10:19.175
That reminds me of my childhood.

10:21.678 --> 10:23.398
That was a true story,
a true story...

10:35.463 --> 10:36.683
Fuck me...

10:37.960 --> 10:40.020
- What was that?
- Shit...

10:44.320 --> 10:46.120
Hey guys, do yourself a favor.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.060
Don't do that head between your knees
crash position shit, if this fuck goes down.

10:50.220 --> 10:51.220
Shut the fuck up!

10:51.552 --> 10:52.672
Shut up!

10:52.713 --> 10:54.333
- Shut the fuck up!
- Suck my dick!

10:54.840 --> 10:56.260
Why would you even say that?

10:56.361 --> 10:58.260
I'm just saying, I've seen
on Discovery channel,

10:58.440 --> 11:01.800
this plane crashed, these people’s spines
went through the top of their skulls

11:01.811 --> 11:03.681
cause they were all bent over
like fucking retards.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.950
- Flannery, I’m gonna knock you the fuck out. Shut up!
- Who is friends with this guy?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.520
- I was just saying.
- Shut the fuck up!

11:09.800 --> 11:11.821
Whoever is closest should just fucking hit him.

11:13.060 --> 11:16.340
Fucking guy, man! is he planning on flying out
of this shit anytime, or what?

11:19.625 --> 11:21.445
Whooa you boys are sensitive.

12:39.510 --> 12:43.110
Hey. There's ice on the
inside of the window.

12:45.311 --> 12:46.851
What's going on?

12:52.422 --> 12:54.022
- What happened?
- ...remain calm.

13:09.649 --> 13:10.949
Tell the pilot to get on

13:11.237 --> 13:12.857
and tell us what’s going on here.

13:17.420 --> 13:20.270
Sir, you have to sit back
down to the seat.

13:40.269 --> 13:42.489
Help! Help me out!

13:53.010 --> 13:54.530
Help! Help!

15:50.000 --> 15:51.220
Somebody help me!

15:52.271 --> 15:54.191
Help me!

15:56.029 --> 15:57.549
Help me, somebody!

15:58.285 --> 16:00.640
Help! Somebody help me!

16:01.702 --> 16:02.702
I got you!

16:03.377 --> 16:04.377
I got you!

16:06.000 --> 16:08.280
- I got you!
- Oh, we fucking went down!

16:08.600 --> 16:12.280
Oh my God! Oh my God!
That guy's cut in half!

16:12.281 --> 16:14.081
Don't look! Don't look at it!
Don't look!

16:14.280 --> 16:16.000
Look at me!
Look at me!

16:16.680 --> 16:20.200
My hand's fucked, my legs fucked.
Aahh! Fuck!

16:20.720 --> 16:23.580
- It’s good…It's good that it hurts.
- Is it good? - Yeah.

16:23.624 --> 16:25.124
Oh, then I’m fucking fabulous.

16:25.220 --> 16:28.060
- Are you bleeding anywhere else?
- I don't know, man, I can't tell.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.880
- Listen, I'll be right back.
- Don't go, don't leave me!

16:29.920 --> 16:33.080
- Where are you going? - Fuck
- Stay calm. It’s okay.

16:33.220 --> 16:35.020
Oh, shit!

16:55.220 --> 16:58.620
It's got to be okay.
There's some Vicodin in my bag.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.220
- Hernandez, are you okay?
- I just gotta make a call to Vanessa.

17:02.320 --> 17:06.140
I gotta make a quick call to
Vanessa. Just one call.

17:06.319 --> 17:09.380
You're in shock, Hernandez.
But I need you to start over.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.800
- What happened?
- The plane went down, man. We crashed.

17:12.839 --> 17:17.000
Oh, no! No! No! That's bullshit!
That's fucking bullshit! I'm just asleep!
- We crashed.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.920
I'm just sleeping! There's no way
that could have happened!

17:20.280 --> 17:23.400
- What about the pilots?
- Pilots? What are you talking about?

17:23.440 --> 17:27.200
The plane's gone, man!
It's in pieces. Look.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.691
Oh, fuck!

17:30.120 --> 17:31.320
Oh, my God!

17:32.040 --> 17:33.240
Oh, my God!

17:35.640 --> 17:38.720
This is so fucked up!
I can't fucking believe it.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.210
- Are there lots of people dead?
- Yes.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.520
But I need you to help me
find the one's that aren't.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.480
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

18:01.234 --> 18:02.234
Oh, fuck!

18:08.110 --> 18:09.610
I got you, allright, I got you.

18:27.611 --> 18:29.011
- Too much blood!
- Fuck!

18:29.479 --> 18:30.679
Fucking phone doesn't work!

18:34.946 --> 18:35.966
I got this. I’m help.

18:36.646 --> 18:38.146
You’re losing too much blood.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.165
Fucking lose all this blood.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.040
- Help him!
- Ottway, help him.

18:45.901 --> 18:47.131
Wait!

18:46.960 --> 18:49.480
It's can't be all coming outside.

18:49.705 --> 18:53.095
Too much blood. This is
way too much blood. Oh! Fuck!

18:55.200 --> 18:58.560
Help me. Help me, okay?
Something's wrong.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.520
Something's really, really wrong here. Okay?
I don't feel right. I just... I just don't.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.320
Help me. Okay? This doesn't...

19:06.360 --> 19:09.460
- Look. - Something's wrong with me,
I know. Okay?

19:10.000 --> 19:14.061
Aahh! I don't feel right.
Something feels wrong.

19:14.147 --> 19:15.587
Listen. Listen.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.080
You're gonna die,
that's what's happening.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.330
What?

19:27.404 --> 19:28.724
It's okay.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.960
No. No. No. No.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.320
- Hold on.
- It's okay.

19:36.360 --> 19:39.680
- Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait...
- Look at me. Sshh!

19:39.691 --> 19:41.291
Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on! No!

19:41.480 --> 19:43.800
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.260
Look at me. Look at me.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.900
Keep looking at me.

19:49.220 --> 19:52.260
It's all right. It's alright.
Look. Look at me. Keep looking at me.

19:52.301 --> 19:53.940
It's all right.

19:55.740 --> 19:57.860
It'll slide over you.

19:58.650 --> 20:00.820
It'll start to feel warm.
Nice and warm.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.540
It'll move over you.
It's all right.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.820
Let your thoughts go.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.880
Hold the good things.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.280
Hold the good things, yeah?

20:18.180 --> 20:19.520
Who do you love?

20:21.940 --> 20:23.780
Who do you love, Lew?

20:29.500 --> 20:31.260
My girl, Rosie.

20:32.260 --> 20:33.540
Is she your daughter?

20:36.340 --> 20:37.560
Yes.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.160
Let her take you then.

20:46.220 --> 20:47.560
Let her take you.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.600
It's okay. It's okay.

21:35.810 --> 21:37.760
Did he just fucking die?

21:39.580 --> 21:41.780
He's just fucking died, didn't he?

21:43.570 --> 21:44.700
Oh, God!

21:44.920 --> 21:45.920
- Did you...?
- Yeah.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.870
- Did you feel him?
- Yeah.

21:50.567 --> 21:52.087
I felt him go.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.859
Is this everyone?

22:11.940 --> 22:13.620
Is this everyone who is still alive?

22:13.641 --> 22:16.321
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- Yeah, I’m going cold.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.340
One... two... three.

22:20.030 --> 22:23.380
Seven, seven of us.
That we know of. Yeah.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.020
Okay. Okay.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.820
We fuck it.

22:29.340 --> 22:32.420
You had to open your fat fucking mouth.
You had to keep talking. You had to put on us?

22:32.460 --> 22:35.260
I didn't do shit.
Did I fucking crash us?

22:36.620 --> 22:38.020
We need a fire.

22:38.121 --> 22:39.721
Did I…I… I didn’t do shit.

22:40.060 --> 22:44.540
We should gather up anything that'll burn.
Seats, luggage, any wood we can find.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.300
- What are you doing?
- I said we need a fire.

22:49.350 --> 22:51.260
It's about ten below and dropping.

22:58.140 --> 22:59.340
So we don't die,

22:59.540 --> 23:02.020
we build up a fire,
then we find food,

23:02.460 --> 23:06.080
and at daybreak we figure out what
way is south and we start walking.

23:06.690 --> 23:09.900
- Nobody is going to find us, not here.
- Somebody will find us.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.700
- I mean, somebody will be fucking searching.
- They gotta know that plane went off the radar.

23:13.720 --> 23:16.100
- Right!
- If they send fifty planes,

23:16.280 --> 23:17.780
maybe they'll find us.
But they won't send fifty planes,

23:17.820 --> 23:19.540
because it won't matter, because...

23:20.020 --> 23:22.060
we won't have time to wait for the one
or two that they will send.

23:22.100 --> 23:25.460
Wilburt doesn't give a fuck.
Wilburt doesn't give a fuck.
Nobody gives a shit about us.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.705
You know how much payroll
they just pocketed in this crash?

23:33.105 --> 23:35.860
If we don't move and work now,
we're all fucked.

23:36.420 --> 23:39.900
Unless you wanna freeze to death,
cause that's the one thing that will come for you.

23:50.340 --> 23:54.000
Hey asshole! I suggest
you get away from here!

23:58.340 --> 24:01.860
A lot of wood...
It’s something to wear.

24:03.340 --> 24:04.540
Don't.

24:04.620 --> 24:06.940
Hey, careful with that,
she would kill us.

24:09.420 --> 24:10.740
Fuck.

24:10.741 --> 24:11.941
Oh, no.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.800
- We gotta do something with the bodies.
- Fuck the bodies!

24:17.120 --> 24:21.360
Fuck the bodies! Grab what burns,
or you're gonna be a body!

24:22.440 --> 24:24.360
- Relax, Rambo. Relax.
- You fucking relax.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.760
Telling me to relax.

24:27.045 --> 24:29.640
- They're everywhere.
- I got a book!

24:30.270 --> 24:33.400
It's called we're all fucked!
It's a best seller.

24:40.001 --> 24:42.851
Here.
Oh, fuck!

24:45.240 --> 24:47.000
- Hey man take it easy with that.
- Why?

24:47.080 --> 24:49.520
Because I don't want to fuckin catch fire.

25:04.260 --> 25:05.230
Hello?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.520
I see you! I'm coming!

25:16.921 --> 25:18.121
Jesus Christ!

25:21.300 --> 25:22.760
Get out you motherfucker!

25:49.430 --> 25:50.590
Who are they?

25:51.770 --> 25:53.360
- You okay?
- You see him?

25:56.460 --> 25:57.740
You okay?

26:01.480 --> 26:06.520
- Come on man, we gotta get the fuck out of here.
- Don't stand, don't stand around.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.860
What the hell was that?

26:12.440 --> 26:14.260
- What's that?
- What the hell was that?

26:14.285 --> 26:15.880
- I didn’t fucking see that.
- Coyotes? Huh?

26:16.744 --> 26:18.964
- What's these shit?
- Fucking big.

26:19.560 --> 26:20.760
They are big.

27:07.490 --> 27:10.290
Maybe I'll turn into a wolfman now, huh?

27:11.330 --> 27:12.410
Wait...

27:12.490 --> 27:15.290
that shit's not real... right?
You mean you can't.

27:15.530 --> 27:17.790
Ass-wipe, what do you think? Really?

27:17.970 --> 27:19.450
I don't know, man.
I mean like Rabies, or whatever.

27:19.490 --> 27:22.770
I didn't think the motherfucker
was gonna grow paws and teeth and shit.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.460
Asshole.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.370
You think there's more of them?

27:26.780 --> 27:28.770
- Wolves?
- Maybe.

27:29.410 --> 27:31.150
Yeah, most likely.

27:31.410 --> 27:33.410
But we shouldn't be worried
about them right now,

27:34.010 --> 27:36.090
we should be worrying about finding food.

27:37.410 --> 27:40.330
- They're probably only passing through.
- Wait a minute.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.890
Passing through as opposed to what?

27:43.890 --> 27:45.850
Living here, hunting here.

27:46.770 --> 27:49.890
Wolves have a territorial range of
over three hundred miles

27:50.400 --> 27:52.000
and a killer range of thirty.

27:55.690 --> 27:57.490
If we're close to their den,

27:57.810 --> 27:59.570
and if we're within that radius,

28:00.380 --> 28:01.810
then they'll come after us.

28:05.940 --> 28:07.590
Well, how can we tell
if we're close?

28:09.240 --> 28:10.410
We can't.

28:11.260 --> 28:12.870
They might have just been feeding,

28:12.970 --> 28:15.850
here's bodies everywhere.
I threatened them, they attacked.

28:15.970 --> 28:17.530
What about the radius?

28:18.130 --> 28:20.660
I mean, if we're in that, what,
they're gonna fight us?

28:21.410 --> 28:24.890
- I thought wolves were scared of people.
- Not if we're near their den.

28:25.610 --> 28:27.410
They're not scared of anything then.

28:28.810 --> 28:32.290
What kind of wolves are they? I mean,
what do they call the ones that just eat plants and shit?

28:33.010 --> 28:35.520
- Huh! They don't call them wolves.
- Herbivores, that's what you mean.

28:35.860 --> 28:37.410
That's wishful thinking.

28:38.090 --> 28:41.290
When did you come king shit
fucking animal expert all of a sudden?

28:42.520 --> 28:44.210
They paid me to kill those things,

28:44.790 --> 28:46.350
to keep them from killing you.

28:46.810 --> 28:51.450
So it makes sense for me to know they're man eaters
and they don't give a shit about berries and shrubs.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.850
There's blood in the air,

28:54.370 --> 28:55.730
and there's death.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.810
They know we're wounded,

29:01.420 --> 29:02.890
they can smell it.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.290
Hopefully they won't fuck with us.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.730
We need to move these bodies out of here.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.290
And then we've gotta find food.

29:26.690 --> 29:28.550
Ah, check this fucking thing out.

29:30.142 --> 29:31.662
Jesus, Diaz. Don't do that.

29:32.330 --> 29:37.590
No, man. I saw one of these once.
It's got a beacon, you know? GPS.

29:39.001 --> 29:40.201
Yeah.

29:43.210 --> 29:44.490
Holy shit!

29:47.610 --> 29:49.450
Holy shit, man! It works.
It's beeping!

29:51.010 --> 29:52.890
This things can reach out like
forty thousand feet.

29:53.181 --> 29:54.981
Yes, I think that's great
if that gives you hope.

29:55.162 --> 29:58.882
- It's fucking heart warming.
- Very funny, bro.

30:00.290 --> 30:04.490
Wow. That nice, my friend.
It's calfskin. It's very nice, not cheap.

30:07.410 --> 30:09.770
And since you cocksuckers
didn't give us a holiday bonus,

30:09.850 --> 30:12.690
- I'm gonna accept this on behalf of my homies.
- Put that back.

30:15.010 --> 30:16.490
Put it back!

30:16.850 --> 30:19.330
We're not looting dead bodies for swag.

30:19.650 --> 30:22.530
You got lucky today, Ottway.
You should be lying there with them. Don't push it!

30:22.570 --> 30:25.410
- I'm not gonna say it again!
- I'm a fucking take a big step back!

30:25.450 --> 30:28.530
I'm gonna start beating the shit
out of you in the next five seconds,

30:28.650 --> 30:31.970
and you're gonna swallow a lot of blood
for a fucking billfold!

30:45.850 --> 30:47.850
I can't fucking stand guys like that.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.210
These turn that into charcoal.

30:50.730 --> 30:54.290
I'd say that we have about enough booze
for you guys to get drunk two more times.

30:54.490 --> 30:56.870
- Fucking weird.
- After that then we’ll all be sober.

30:56.881 --> 30:58.271
Jack makes me fight.

30:58.450 --> 31:01.210
- Ladies, ladies...
- You like the white or brown?

31:01.290 --> 31:04.370
How about some brown stuff?
No Tequila, sorry about that.

31:04.790 --> 31:07.490
- It's all good. Thanks, papa.
- Where the fuck did you get that?

31:07.530 --> 31:10.490
From that thing...
that server thing with wheels on it.

31:10.690 --> 31:14.830
There's bunch of dead bodies all over, man.
You wanna make sure you know where that meat came from.

31:15.210 --> 31:18.930
You know, it's like that movie where they start
taking chunks of frozen ass out of that guy.

31:19.490 --> 31:21.930
- The plane crash, with that dude from training day? - Right.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.050
It might be fucking funny as fuck.

31:24.490 --> 31:26.490
How would you like
a dead ass on a stick?

31:26.810 --> 31:30.250
And you thought like a severed dick
was hot dog, right? That's too fucking funny.

31:31.330 --> 31:33.290
I wish some of the other dudes
would have lived.

31:40.570 --> 31:41.970
Did you hear that?

31:42.530 --> 31:44.030
Get up, get up!

31:45.851 --> 31:47.331
Let's move. Go, go!

31:47.490 --> 31:49.250
What the fuck is that?

31:49.851 --> 31:50.951
What is it?

31:59.010 --> 32:02.570
Everybody be cool.
Don't move.

32:08.450 --> 32:12.310
- Jesus Christ!
- Stare right back them.

32:17.690 --> 32:19.510
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Why are they coming closer?

32:20.010 --> 32:23.570
- Ah, fuck this shit! I'm getting back in the plane.
- Hendrick, God damn it! Don't move.

32:24.850 --> 32:27.170
Look at the size of that fucking thing.

32:45.250 --> 32:47.810
We'll take two hour shifts.

32:47.810 --> 32:49.770
I'll start. You guys get some sleep.

32:50.450 --> 32:53.210
Yeah. Like that shit's gonna happen.

33:42.290 --> 33:44.010
Don't be afraid.

33:56.401 --> 33:57.411
Hey!

34:00.930 --> 34:02.380
Don’t drift out from us, Burke.

34:03.790 --> 34:05.190
I’ll be allright

34:07.020 --> 34:08.449
I'm not gonna sleep.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.790
Motherfucker.

34:23.889 --> 34:26.489
Where is my goddamn kid
when I need him?

36:22.090 --> 36:23.290
Jesus Christ!

36:31.810 --> 36:33.290
Oh, Jesus Christ.

36:36.405 --> 36:37.770
No, no, no, no!

36:38.267 --> 36:39.287
Fuck!

36:39.754 --> 36:40.754
Man it's... fuck!

36:41.899 --> 36:43.099
Oh, shit!

36:49.771 --> 36:50.991
They ate him.

36:53.210 --> 36:55.090
Jesus Christ!
They ate him.

36:55.091 --> 36:56.791
Fuck, fuck!

37:00.130 --> 37:01.730
They weren't eating him.

37:03.530 --> 37:05.170
They were killing him.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.290
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

37:09.370 --> 37:13.210
How did we not hear them?
How many did it take to do that?

37:14.880 --> 37:16.930
We could dig in, make some...

37:17.910 --> 37:20.050
kind of a stand,
not much cover though.

37:20.365 --> 37:22.070
Woh! Woh! What do you mean,
a stand?

37:22.545 --> 37:25.370
Like fight those motherfucking giant things?
Are you out of your mind?

37:25.435 --> 37:28.090
They'll get bold, start to come in for us.

37:28.210 --> 37:29.530
Why would they?

37:29.890 --> 37:32.050
- I mean, we're not harming them. It's not for food!
- We're a threat.

37:32.090 --> 37:34.090
We don't belong here, that's it.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.090
There's trees out there,

37:41.490 --> 37:43.550
if we can get to that tree line,
they might back off.

37:43.590 --> 37:45.970
If they see that we're leaving,
they might.

37:46.050 --> 37:48.650
Fuck that! What they might do?
Bullshit!

37:49.050 --> 37:51.890
What they might do?!
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:52.500 --> 37:55.830
Hey, they pissed all over this place.
They mean to tag it.

37:55.890 --> 37:57.770
We can't wait them out, we'll starve.

37:58.010 --> 38:02.590
There's a lot of bad space between us
and that forest, but if we get there, then...

38:03.250 --> 38:07.690
we could better defend ourselves.
Less exposed, I don't know.

38:07.810 --> 38:09.330
Yeah. You don't know.

38:10.450 --> 38:12.610
And nobody nominated you shit,
by the way.

38:14.490 --> 38:16.290
It's getting to that point
in the evening, girls.

38:16.610 --> 38:18.490
- Fucking heach is on.
- What the fuck you talking about?

38:18.570 --> 38:21.330
Diaz, come on, man. You wouldn't last
five fucking minutes out here.

38:21.370 --> 38:24.450
I survived that.
This ain't shit.

38:24.690 --> 38:27.490
- I find a way through, with or without.
- Fuck it.

38:27.610 --> 38:30.330
I'm gonna take whatever I can carry
and head into those trees.

38:31.290 --> 38:33.770
You guys wanna join me,
then strip everything.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.410
Fucking losers.

39:57.139 --> 39:58.159
Hey!

40:00.290 --> 40:02.290
We should collect all the wallets

40:03.290 --> 40:04.850
for the families.

40:08.850 --> 40:12.770
Wallets? Did I hear wallets?
Cause I carried a wallet.

40:16.010 --> 40:19.570
Hendrick, do you mind carrying them?

40:19.650 --> 40:21.690
Yeah, let's waste a little more time.

40:22.210 --> 40:24.650
Even though the weather's about
to kick our ass.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.725
You grab them wallets.

40:28.890 --> 40:30.190
Fucking idiots!

40:32.650 --> 40:34.090
To Hernandez.

40:37.890 --> 40:39.330
Grab as many as you can.

40:40.890 --> 40:45.050
Grab, as many as you can.
Waste as much fuckin' time as you can.

40:45.650 --> 40:47.690
I'm gonna stay here
with my friend, Jack Daniels,

40:47.890 --> 40:50.090
and waste some time of my own.

40:52.690 --> 40:57.370
- Why don't you just fucking help us, man? Huh?
- Oh, I'm helping you. I'm helping you. I'm warming up, man!

40:57.490 --> 40:59.530
You guys find any rubbish, save 'em.

40:59.970 --> 41:03.730
- I don't know how long I'm gonna be out here with you fairies.
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

41:08.900 --> 41:10.885
The key to survival, fellas.

41:11.170 --> 41:14.210
Grab their wallets...
grab their wallets.

41:52.930 --> 41:54.090
Hendrick.

42:15.330 --> 42:16.650
Wait!

42:22.690 --> 42:26.560
I feel like we should say something.
I mean, all these bodies, all these...

42:27.020 --> 42:31.560
all these people that died,
it doesn't seem right to just walk away.

42:41.890 --> 42:45.410
I don't know any official prayers,
so uh... I guess, uh...

42:48.530 --> 42:50.610
God bless these men.

42:51.890 --> 42:53.290
They were...

42:54.770 --> 42:57.330
some of them, our friends.

42:58.290 --> 43:00.690
and uh... we could be
lying here with them.

43:05.570 --> 43:09.450
So, thank you for sparing us
and helping us.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.730
Oh, and... keep that up, if you can.

44:44.831 --> 44:45.931
Fuck!

44:47.532 --> 44:48.732
Fuck!

44:54.010 --> 44:56.370
Don't worry about me,
motherfuckers!

44:56.490 --> 45:00.490
If any of you wanna run off into the trees,
that's cool too.

45:02.091 --> 45:04.610
No! No! No! Ottway!

45:06.010 --> 45:07.290
Help me!

45:07.545 --> 45:08.930
Help me!

45:09.161 --> 45:10.361
Help...

45:10.690 --> 45:12.090
Oh, fuck!

45:12.690 --> 45:13.890
Flannery!

45:14.198 --> 45:15.318
Get off him!

45:15.978 --> 45:17.098
Flannery!

45:20.350 --> 45:21.350
Flannery!

45:25.211 --> 45:26.731
Jesus!
Flannery!

45:27.732 --> 45:28.532
Flannery!

46:06.030 --> 46:07.490
No.

46:46.210 --> 46:47.790
Do you wanna say anything?

46:55.210 --> 46:58.290
Come on. Let's keep moving.
There's nothing else we can do for him.

47:13.010 --> 47:15.010
Those trees aren't getting
any fucking closer.

47:15.490 --> 47:17.450
We're gonna be out here
in the dark with those things.

47:18.090 --> 47:21.090
We have no idea if we're going
towards them or away from it, do we?

47:21.570 --> 47:24.770
- Why didn't we just stay with the plane?
- Oh, come on.

47:24.850 --> 47:28.370
- They would have surrounded us. - How the fuck
do we know if they're not doing that right now?!

47:29.480 --> 47:30.700
Fucking genius.

47:32.050 --> 47:35.410
- We're still better off in the trees.
- Yeah, we're better off.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.430
- You tell that kid.
- Fuck.

47:58.610 --> 48:00.290
What is that?

48:04.490 --> 48:06.490
- Run!
- Go, go into the trees!

48:06.757 --> 48:08.257
All this way!

48:11.610 --> 48:13.230
Go, go, go!

48:13.490 --> 48:15.690
- They are right on us.
- Don't stop running!

48:17.170 --> 48:18.970
Wait, wait.

48:23.490 --> 48:24.810
Don't look back!

48:24.911 --> 48:25.911
Run!

48:26.610 --> 48:27.970
They're flanking us!

48:29.250 --> 48:30.570
Don't stop!

48:39.850 --> 48:42.890
- Sam? Sam?
- They're all around us!

48:44.330 --> 48:47.010
Need a fire to keep them off us.
Hurry!

48:49.170 --> 48:50.770
Wood is wet.

48:51.250 --> 48:52.730
Lets burn it, hurry!

48:56.036 --> 48:57.890
Get that fucking thing lit.

49:02.090 --> 49:03.810
- Come on!
- Come on, baby, come on!

49:03.890 --> 49:05.610
Tell me that thing’s unbroke.

49:06.890 --> 49:09.490
Just can't get it going that way.

49:09.591 --> 49:10.791
Hurry!

49:11.930 --> 49:14.130
OK, that's it. That's it.

49:16.831 --> 49:18.115
It's going out...
Fuck!

49:25.430 --> 49:27.730
- That's it. Come on.
- That’s fine.

49:47.880 --> 49:48.960
It worked.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.920
We start perimeter fires.

49:52.160 --> 49:54.280
Let’s see these bastards before hey come…

50:19.280 --> 50:21.120
What the fuck was that?

50:21.581 --> 50:22.581
The alpha.

50:22.730 --> 50:24.180
They went at him,

50:26.180 --> 50:27.500
he put it down.

50:28.511 --> 50:30.940
Whatever... whatever that challenge was,

50:31.420 --> 50:32.700
the alpha put it down.

50:35.260 --> 50:37.060
How are we gonna deal with this?

50:37.380 --> 50:38.700
We kill them.

50:40.380 --> 50:41.820
One at a time.

50:42.260 --> 50:43.780
Tip the numbers.

50:44.340 --> 50:46.100
That's what they're doing to us.

51:03.340 --> 51:05.980
- What the hell are these for?
- I'll explain.

51:06.460 --> 51:09.500
Fix them with electrical tape.
Talget, you got some, yeah?

51:09.780 --> 51:10.980
In here somewhere.

51:11.020 --> 51:12.780
Shot gun shell...

51:14.380 --> 51:15.780
spear tip.

51:16.980 --> 51:20.060
The tip has to drive into the primer
and set off the shell.

51:20.671 --> 51:21.980
Secure them with these sticks

51:22.380 --> 51:24.860
with the tape, simple.

51:26.151 --> 51:28.140
Jab with them when
the wolf gets close.

51:28.500 --> 51:29.980
Hit 'em hard,

51:30.180 --> 51:31.780
gotta get real close.

51:34.460 --> 51:35.740
It'll work,

51:36.220 --> 51:37.820
it's like a bang stick.

51:38.380 --> 51:41.140
A round discharges,
you pull it loose,

51:42.201 --> 51:44.860
you still got something sharp
to create distance.

51:46.380 --> 51:49.460
Unless you want to fist fight 'em.
There you go.

51:51.180 --> 51:54.860
One shot a piece, guys.
Make 'em count. Burke.

51:57.900 --> 52:01.780
Blacken the tips with in the fire, guys.
Makes them harder, stronger.

52:04.060 --> 52:07.740
Really, boys?
This is what's come down too, huh?

52:08.380 --> 52:10.820
This MacGyver bullshit?

52:13.980 --> 52:15.020
Okay.

52:15.980 --> 52:17.060
Good.

52:19.860 --> 52:22.860
I appreciate a good laugh
as much as the next guy.

52:34.900 --> 52:37.120
These things, they see well at night?

52:37.400 --> 52:39.480
Jesus, can we talk
about something else, please?

52:40.720 --> 52:44.160
Talget, you're carrying all that booze.
Let's break it out.

52:44.340 --> 52:48.200
- I recommend rationing what we have.
- I recommend you kissin' my ass.

52:48.580 --> 52:50.320
What, are you the booze police now?

52:50.880 --> 52:54.440
You fucking guys, with your rules
and orders and bullshit.

52:55.160 --> 52:56.560
Where are we?

52:56.960 --> 52:58.360
Look around.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.760
This is Fuck City,

53:00.960 --> 53:03.780
population five and dwindling.

53:08.440 --> 53:11.680
Two days, three maybe,
if we really pull our shit together.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.280
Who's in charge of that right now?
This fucking guy?

53:18.000 --> 53:19.600
The great white hunter,

53:22.800 --> 53:25.560
with his jerry rigged
fucking wolf sticks.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.720
Why are you constantly breaking balls
and bitching about everything?

53:30.760 --> 53:32.680
Cause I wanna live, motherfucker.

53:32.840 --> 53:33.960
Do you understand that?

53:34.080 --> 53:37.080
I don't want some Timberwolf
shittin' me out on this mountain.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.800
You're scared.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.720
- What?
- You don't need all that nonsense,

53:44.160 --> 53:46.480
all that chest puff bullshit.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.200
What's wrong with being scared?

53:49.000 --> 53:50.680
I'm not scared.

53:51.131 --> 53:52.760
- You're not?
- No.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.840
- I'm terrified.
- I can tell.

53:56.920 --> 54:00.600
And not an ounce of shame in saying it.
I'm scared shitless.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.320
That's because you're a punk.

54:05.720 --> 54:07.880
I don't walk through this world
with fear in my heart.

54:07.960 --> 54:09.800
You pick that up in the pen?

54:10.400 --> 54:13.720
Somebody scribble that
in the day room wall?

54:14.280 --> 54:16.400
You better take it easy,
motherfucker.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.880
Talking tough means jackshit now.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.800
You're not scared?

54:22.400 --> 54:25.200
You're a fool.
Worse, you're a fucking liar.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.880
I should have checked
your chin in the fuckin' plane.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.240
Get up! Come on!
Get up, you big Irish fuck.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.300
- You wanna knuckle up? Come on! Come on,
we don't have - Put that fucking knife down.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.880
- Get the fuck off me!
- Put that knife away!

54:34.960 --> 54:37.160
Shut up! Shut up.
You chicken shits make me sick.

54:37.880 --> 54:39.160
Son of a bitch!

54:39.200 --> 54:41.680
You got that kid, Flannery killed
and you're not gonna get me killed.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.160
Put your fucking hands up. Let me show you
how this is done. Put your fucking hands up!

54:48.120 --> 54:52.240
- Ah! You motherfucker!
- Cut this shit out!

54:52.320 --> 54:53.960
Do you hear me?

55:21.066 --> 55:22.800
Get up, get up, get up.

56:11.680 --> 56:12.880
What the fuck?

56:13.840 --> 56:15.120
What did it want?

56:16.080 --> 56:17.400
You.

56:37.900 --> 56:40.600
Diaz, please don't do that shit
to me again.

56:41.880 --> 56:43.120
Allright?

56:55.200 --> 56:56.660
No mas!

57:10.600 --> 57:12.200
That was bullshit,

57:14.160 --> 57:15.600
I'm sorry.

57:17.601 --> 57:18.601
I'm sorry.

57:43.351 --> 57:47.100
- Fuck you! Fuck!
- ...fuck?

57:49.101 --> 57:50.101
Fuck!

57:51.405 --> 57:52.625
Fuck!

57:54.421 --> 57:56.880
Diaz, I think you got him. Yeah!

58:01.960 --> 58:04.000
Oh! You Fuck!

58:04.920 --> 58:06.680
I think I lost a nail. Ah!

58:11.831 --> 58:14.400
Is that the big one?
That big fucker?

58:15.320 --> 58:18.200
It's not the alpha,
It's an omega.

58:18.760 --> 58:23.040
An outcast. They sent it in
to test you, Diaz.

58:23.571 --> 58:27.200
That freak bitch!
Die, fucking bitch!

58:27.971 --> 58:29.640
You fucking dog.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.910
Let's get a large branch

58:52.080 --> 58:55.360
sharpen the end of it,
shove it up in this thing's ass.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.350
We're gonna cook that son of bitch.

59:01.240 --> 59:02.920
And then we're gonna eat it.

59:10.360 --> 59:12.259
Hey, wolf? Not so tough now, huh wolf?

59:14.222 --> 59:17.660
- You want? Come on!
- No! - I've got it. - I've got it.

59:18.225 --> 59:19.699
Is this the white meat
or dark meat?

59:19.700 --> 59:22.427
- Dark...
- As black as bug.

59:22.986 --> 59:23.707
Yeah?

59:23.708 --> 59:28.067
And I know it tastes like shit, but guys,
it might be the last meat we'll get for a while.

59:28.068 --> 59:29.375
It's grisly too.

59:30.309 --> 59:32.345
- It tastes like shit, I know,
but eat it, guys. - Yeah.

59:32.346 --> 59:34.381
It tastes like dog shit.

59:35.032 --> 59:37.994
Then I'm much more
of a cat person really.

59:45.637 --> 59:49.258
- Burke? - Yeah.
- Are you all right?

59:49.679 --> 59:51.120
My head's a little off. I'm...

59:51.121 --> 59:54.056
- Sit down, sit down.
- I feel a little dizzy.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:12.448
- You think they're watching us?
- Oh, yeah. They're watching us.

01:00:13.249 --> 01:00:17.150
You'll fuck with us,
we'll fuck with you.

01:00:18.251 --> 01:00:19.251
You hear that?

01:00:21.893 --> 01:00:24.014
You're not the animals!

01:00:24.773 --> 01:00:26.530
We're the animals!

01:00:33.257 --> 01:00:36.931
Come here you fucker!
Come here you puppy.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.942
- Oh, yeah ...
- You're a twisted fuck.

01:00:44.943 --> 01:00:47.062
You wrong for that,
that is wrong!

01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:50.865
I'm not crazy.
I'm not fucking crazy. You fuck!

01:00:52.805 --> 01:00:54.186
That's fucked up.

01:00:55.187 --> 01:00:56.494
I mean, that's fucked up.

01:00:57.108 --> 01:00:59.732
You tried to steal my fucking life?

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:03.958
Come on, you fuck!

01:01:08.073 --> 01:01:10.027
You hear the bones cracking, Diaz.
Come on, that's enough.

01:01:10.028 --> 01:01:11.908
Fucking mut! Come on.

01:01:11.909 --> 01:01:13.039
Let him have this.

01:01:13.074 --> 01:01:15.637
Little Fido here wants to go home.

01:01:16.917 --> 01:01:18.996
He wants to see his brothers.

01:01:18.997 --> 01:01:21.038
Jesus, he's crazy.

01:01:21.238 --> 01:01:23.079
That's what I'm gonna do...

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.832
I'm gonna help him to get there.

01:01:34.045 --> 01:01:36.883
Say goodbye boys.

01:01:51.971 --> 01:01:54.617
Take it back, motherfucker!

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:58.154
We should keep moving.

01:03:10.126 --> 01:03:12.925
These goddamn things are calling us out.

01:03:12.926 --> 01:03:15.207
What the hell are you talking about, Talget?

01:03:15.408 --> 01:03:19.408
Wolves are the only animal
that will seek revenge.

01:03:19.409 --> 01:03:22.406
Hey, I don't wanna hear anymore
about fucking wolves

01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:25.170
or you're gonna start
seeing them everywhere.

01:03:26.473 --> 01:03:28.190
Burke, how are you doin'?

01:03:28.654 --> 01:03:31.717
I can't breath.
I can't keep going.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:34.295
Ottway, we can't keep going.

01:03:34.596 --> 01:03:36.897
We can't stop.
Those things will be all over us.

01:03:37.198 --> 01:03:38.833
We gotta keep going.

01:03:40.139 --> 01:03:43.502
Ottway, Burke is hurting here, man.

01:03:49.062 --> 01:03:50.508
This'll work.

01:03:53.944 --> 01:03:55.265
It's a dead end!

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:57.590
They can't get in behind us.

01:03:58.027 --> 01:04:00.512
They'll have to hit us from out front.

01:04:00.909 --> 01:04:02.291
Let's build a fire.

01:04:11.594 --> 01:04:13.112
That thing still workin'?

01:04:13.313 --> 01:04:15.073
Up to forty thousand feet.

01:04:15.354 --> 01:04:18.294
This shit has to save somebody
at some point, right?

01:04:18.895 --> 01:04:20.830
I keep sittin' here thinkin',

01:04:21.537 --> 01:04:26.356
even with all this stuff goin' on, that we hit
the ground at four hundred miles an hour,

01:04:27.799 --> 01:04:29.481
and we made it.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.521
Why would we go through
something like that, that crash,

01:04:33.522 --> 01:04:37.964
if it wasn't meant to be?
Or ordained?

01:04:38.564 --> 01:04:41.585
By who? The almighty?

01:04:42.326 --> 01:04:44.447
That fucking fairy tale?

01:04:44.687 --> 01:04:47.247
How's about good
old fashioned blind luck?

01:04:47.548 --> 01:04:52.025
Flannery survived that crash,
so did Hernandez. It don't matter,

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:55.115
if they didn't give a fuck.

01:04:57.152 --> 01:04:58.459
Dead is dead.

01:05:00.453 --> 01:05:02.533
Where do you think
those boys are now?

01:05:02.534 --> 01:05:03.655
Up in heaven?

01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:05.907
Getting fit for wings?

01:05:07.457 --> 01:05:10.057
No. I'll tell you where they are.

01:05:11.498 --> 01:05:13.659
They're not, that's where.

01:05:16.142 --> 01:05:18.927
They're no where.
They're gone.

01:05:19.863 --> 01:05:22.342
Well, I don't believe it.

01:05:24.183 --> 01:05:25.306
I do.

01:05:27.025 --> 01:05:32.308
I wish I didn't. I really wish
I could believe in that stuff.

01:05:34.629 --> 01:05:37.069
This is real. The cold.

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.070
That's real, the air in my lungs.

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:47.424
Those bastards, out there in the dark,
stalking us.

01:05:48.035 --> 01:05:51.930
It's this world that I'm worried about,
Talget, not the next.

01:05:51.961 --> 01:05:53.641
What about your faith?

01:05:54.197 --> 01:05:55.418
What about it?

01:05:57.398 --> 01:05:58.866
It's important.

01:06:02.521 --> 01:06:04.856
Emma... is she with you guys?

01:06:05.202 --> 01:06:06.082
It’s ok, big guy.

01:06:06.083 --> 01:06:08.722
She was out the back house.
Speaking with her... she is...

01:06:08.723 --> 01:06:10.562
She is, she is not here.

01:06:10.563 --> 01:06:14.165
- She’s not here. Why don’t you…
- You tell her, that I am here...

01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:18.442
Of course, yeah, just lie down, she is
coming. - That was good.

01:06:19.603 --> 01:06:21.129
Yeah.

01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:25.558
He's seeing things?

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:28.465
He's hallucinating, it's hypoxia.

01:06:28.566 --> 01:06:30.702
Not enough oxygen is getting to his brain.

01:06:30.893 --> 01:06:31.693
Hypoxia.

01:06:33.534 --> 01:06:37.109
- Why don't the rest of us have it?
- Uh... it depends on the person.

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:39.857
Some people can't handle the altitude.

01:06:42.939 --> 01:06:44.539
Who is Emma?

01:06:44.674 --> 01:06:46.640
She was, his sister.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:50.709
She died when he was a kid.

01:06:56.144 --> 01:06:57.751
My daughter, Mary,

01:07:01.046 --> 01:07:03.895
she's got really long hair,
almost down to her waist.

01:07:04.648 --> 01:07:06.247
In fact it's the one rule,

01:07:06.268 --> 01:07:10.030
my fucking ex respects, which is that
I'm the only one who cuts her hair.

01:07:11.531 --> 01:07:12.590
She does this thing,

01:07:12.601 --> 01:07:15.046
she'll come and hover over me,

01:07:14.147 --> 01:07:17.073
I'll just be dead asleep,

01:07:18.153 --> 01:07:20.449
and she'll start swinging
her head back and forth,

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:24.463
tickling me with her...
with her hair all in my face

01:07:25.117 --> 01:07:27.117
and she'll be laughing like crazy.

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.783
Just... it's a certain type of laugh,
you know,

01:07:31.854 --> 01:07:33.641
when a kid goes past
laughing to laughing like a...

01:07:36.662 --> 01:07:40.389
Like they can't really breathe.
Sound more like an old man than a kid.

01:07:47.527 --> 01:07:49.276
I miss the hell out of that kid.

01:07:49.926 --> 01:07:50.926
Yeah.

01:07:51.809 --> 01:07:54.355
You should. You know that?

01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:59.588
Those facts of your life,
whatever they might be,

01:08:01.973 --> 01:08:05.253
make you want that next minute more
than the last.

01:08:06.254 --> 01:08:08.728
Make you fight for it.

01:08:13.017 --> 01:08:15.658
I just wanna fuck one more time.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:21.380
- You ruined my story. Motherfucker.
- No, man. - I'm telling a... - No, man.

01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:23.783
I'm telling a nice little sweet story
about my daughter.

01:08:23.783 --> 01:08:25.283
I don't mean to wreck your shit, bro.

01:08:25.484 --> 01:08:26.285
I don't, I don't.

01:08:26.582 --> 01:08:29.877
I just can't go out on that last piece of horrible
ass that I had. You know what I'm saying?

01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:32.526
Fifty three year old hooker, half Eskimo.

01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:34.106
You shouldn't talk about that.

01:08:34.107 --> 01:08:37.706
She was 250-260, no shit.

01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:41.238
The bitch gave me the clap
like it was gift wrapped.

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.439
No, no, no.

01:08:49.712 --> 01:08:51.033
That ain't right.

01:08:51.754 --> 01:08:56.862
No, I just didn't think that I would... I would punch
out and that would be my fucking swan song, right?

01:09:00.438 --> 01:09:04.615
That alone is worth a fight.
That's worth a fight.

01:09:05.361 --> 01:09:11.361
My uh... my dad was not without love.

01:09:19.846 --> 01:09:23.969
But a cliched Irish motherfucker

01:09:24.004 --> 01:09:25.825
when he wanted to be.

01:09:26.059 --> 01:09:28.868
Drinker, brawler, all that stuff.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.944
Never shed a tear,

01:09:32.131 --> 01:09:34.430
it's a weakness everywhere.

01:09:39.455 --> 01:09:41.939
But he had this thing for

01:09:42.596 --> 01:09:44.697
poems, poetry.

01:09:45.537 --> 01:09:47.158
Reading them, quoting them,

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.288
probably thought it rounded him off,
you know?

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.363
His way of apologizing I guess.

01:09:59.144 --> 01:10:02.807
And there was one that hung over
the desk in his den.

01:10:03.225 --> 01:10:06.346
It was only when I was
a lot older I realized

01:10:06.781 --> 01:10:08.368
he'd written it.

01:10:09.629 --> 01:10:11.471
It was untitled,

01:10:12.029 --> 01:10:13.471
four lines.

01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:16.974
I read it at his funeral.

01:10:21.713 --> 01:10:27.697
Once more into the fray.
Into the last good fight I'll ever know.

01:10:29.478 --> 01:10:32.159
Live and die on this day

01:10:33.238 --> 01:10:37.281
Live and die on this day.

01:11:07.774 --> 01:11:09.306
Storm clouds.

01:11:09.895 --> 01:11:10.936
Blizzard?

01:11:11.736 --> 01:11:12.936
A good bet.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.523
Based on our luck.

01:11:16.424 --> 01:11:17.524
It's our fucking luck.

01:11:17.818 --> 01:11:21.580
Let's bundle Burke up
and dig in against these trees,

01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:23.227
snow's deep enough.

01:11:23.861 --> 01:11:28.550
I'm worried if we lose this fire,
we'll all freeze.

01:11:42.588 --> 01:11:44.589
Burke, moving on.

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.144
Come on, Burke, wake up!

01:11:47.405 --> 01:11:50.518
Burke! Wake up!

01:11:50.553 --> 01:11:53.349
Listen, Burke, wake up!
Do you hear me?

01:11:53.793 --> 01:11:55.539
Don't sleep, you hear me?

01:11:56.515 --> 01:11:58.035
Burke, come on!

01:11:58.036 --> 01:12:00.382
Wake up, Burke, Burke!

01:12:03.278 --> 01:12:06.120
Burke, Burke! Wake up!

01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:09.381
Wake up, wake up!

01:12:10.816 --> 01:12:13.823
Wake up right now.
Wake...

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:53.582
Don't be afraid!

01:14:20.438 --> 01:14:21.438
What is it?

01:14:22.899 --> 01:14:25.534
Guys, get up, up!

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.246
What is it?
Is it them?

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.487
Saw marks.
These trees have been logged.

01:14:46.507 --> 01:14:50.364
That's water!
That sounds like a river.

01:15:09.563 --> 01:15:11.368
You gotta be shittin' me!

01:15:11.918 --> 01:15:15.440
The river must be a good size
if we can hear it all the way up here.

01:15:15.526 --> 01:15:19.100
At least if we're following a river,
we got a better chance of finding shelter.

01:15:20.501 --> 01:15:21.755
Who's climbing down that?

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:24.623
I can't. There's no way I can do that.

01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:28.757
Well, we can't go back.
There's no way we can go back.

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:32.890
- Those trees though.
- What trees?

01:15:33.813 --> 01:15:35.018
Them out there.

01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:41.010
We got a tether of some kind, secure it
between here and there. We can climb down.

01:15:42.196 --> 01:15:46.602
Guys, it's simple.
It's the wolves or those trees.

01:15:48.204 --> 01:15:50.435
You're not talking about
jumping off the cliff?

01:15:50.556 --> 01:15:53.352
It's an idea, I didn't say
it was a good one.

01:15:55.168 --> 01:15:57.926
He's talking about jumping off the cliff.

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:14.975
This will wind up
being one of those wild stories

01:16:14.977 --> 01:16:18.605
you tell at a party,
pretty girl on your lap.

01:16:19.796 --> 01:16:23.108
- All right, are you ready?
- Yeah, why not?

01:16:23.509 --> 01:16:25.404
Go get a good running start,
get a grip.

01:16:26.139 --> 01:16:28.506
Now you'll free fall about thirty feet,

01:16:28.521 --> 01:16:29.955
but it's gonna feel
like thirty thousand.

01:16:30.156 --> 01:16:32.329
Is this supposed to pass for a pep talk?

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:35.243
When we feel this go taut,
we'll take up the slack

01:16:35.244 --> 01:16:37.358
to stop you from hitting too hard.

01:16:37.909 --> 01:16:39.214
When you get in there.

01:16:39.316 --> 01:16:40.360
I'll figure it out.

01:16:41.394 --> 01:16:43.826
If you gotta go, this is
a pretty cool way to go, bro.

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:46.921
Better a flying leap
than those fucking wolves, right?

01:16:57.608 --> 01:16:59.604
I hope there's something down there.

01:17:05.462 --> 01:17:06.299
Fuck!

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.203
Go, go, go, go...

01:17:23.784 --> 01:17:26.349
Which one of you fuckers…

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:32.938
Pull me up!

01:17:36.038 --> 01:17:38.080
Fuck! Pull me back!

01:17:43.103 --> 01:17:44.222
Hendrick!

01:17:49.530 --> 01:17:51.358
Hendrick, you in there?

01:17:52.763 --> 01:17:55.038
Yeah! I'm all right!

01:18:07.133 --> 01:18:09.763
Anyone with the nards to go first?

01:18:09.927 --> 01:18:10.924
Talget?

01:18:11.365 --> 01:18:12.361
Diaz?

01:18:13.879 --> 01:18:14.878
I'll go.

01:18:22.681 --> 01:18:24.198
Don't stay out there too long.

01:18:25.156 --> 01:18:28.796
Hendrick! Make sure that thing is secure!

01:18:30.165 --> 01:18:33.430
It's secure, but I don't know
how long it's gonna last!

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:36.042
Don't spend a lot of time out there!

01:18:38.587 --> 01:18:39.665
You all right?

01:18:40.203 --> 01:18:41.260
Yeah. You go.

01:18:41.271 --> 01:18:42.338
What about your hand?

01:18:42.374 --> 01:18:43.593
I'm all right.

01:18:44.295 --> 01:18:46.689
Go ahead. Just haul me in
if anything goes wrong.

01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:47.689
Yeah.

01:18:50.442 --> 01:18:53.232
Just fucking hate heights, man.
Flips me out.

01:18:54.934 --> 01:18:56.549
Well then you go,
I’ll stay and make sure...

01:18:56.550 --> 01:19:01.408
No. I'm good. You cross, seriously.
Give me a minute to get my head around it.

01:19:02.498 --> 01:19:05.088
All right, I’m through.
I’m across.

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:07.128
I'm coming!

01:19:14.911 --> 01:19:15.909
All right!

01:19:16.428 --> 01:19:18.407
I'm coming to cross now.

01:19:30.878 --> 01:19:31.876
Okay.

01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:36.676
Come on, you can do this.

01:19:37.544 --> 01:19:38.924
You can do this.

01:19:46.964 --> 01:19:49.971
Talget, you ready?

01:21:11.516 --> 01:21:15.254
Talget, stop fucking around!
Move your ass!

01:22:12.702 --> 01:22:14.412
Hey, baby girl.

01:22:19.729 --> 01:22:22.309
Hey, baby girl.

01:22:25.227 --> 01:22:26.946
I love you, daddy.

01:22:33.104 --> 01:22:35.268
- Oh, God, no!
- Fucking killing him!

01:22:35.842 --> 01:22:38.502
- No, no!
- Diaz don't.

01:22:40.639 --> 01:22:41.959
They're killing him!

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.438
Talget!

01:22:50.276 --> 01:22:52.767
They fucking took him!
No, no, no!

01:22:54.633 --> 01:22:55.932
Fuck!

01:22:58.592 --> 01:22:59.631
Talget!

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:00.610
They took him!

01:23:00.611 --> 01:23:03.169
- They took him! Talget!
- They fucking took us!

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.175
They took him!

01:23:10.547 --> 01:23:11.814
My knee!

01:23:11.947 --> 01:23:13.778
My fucking knee!

01:23:34.256 --> 01:23:35.594
They're just picking us off,

01:23:36.295 --> 01:23:37.576
one by one.

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:44.421
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.
Ah! My knee!

01:23:44.655 --> 01:23:46.182
- Let's get you up.
- I can't!

01:23:46.219 --> 01:23:48.210
- Let's get you up.
- I can’t… fuck.

01:23:48.579 --> 01:23:51.085
Motherfucking things.

01:23:59.693 --> 01:24:01.867
They're not gonna let us go,
are they?

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:13.048
What do you do?

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:19.709
Fuck it!

01:26:45.059 --> 01:26:46.258
Forget it.

01:26:53.415 --> 01:26:56.528
Whatever I had in the tank
I used back there.

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.179
I'm beat.

01:27:02.048 --> 01:27:04.810
I just want to sit.
I just wanna...

01:27:08.328 --> 01:27:10.135
stop this bullshit.

01:27:12.964 --> 01:27:14.433
My fucking leg.

01:27:18.521 --> 01:27:20.707
My ankle's fucked.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.599
Diaz. Don't sit down.

01:27:24.681 --> 01:27:25.912
Don't sit down.

01:27:25.913 --> 01:27:26.911
I know, I know...

01:27:29.678 --> 01:27:31.298
I don't wanna argue.

01:27:33.196 --> 01:27:35.092
I just wanna rest.

01:27:48.069 --> 01:27:50.328
I just had the clearest thought.

01:27:56.286 --> 01:27:57.817
I'm done.

01:27:59.883 --> 01:28:01.114
I'm done.

01:28:03.963 --> 01:28:05.641
Come on, man. Up.

01:28:08.599 --> 01:28:11.182
There could be a cabin down river,
right there.

01:28:12.478 --> 01:28:15.255
That's a mile up at least, brother.

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:17.429
I can't walk that, man.

01:28:19.555 --> 01:28:21.374
I can't walk fifty feet.

01:28:27.071 --> 01:28:28.303
Fuck it.

01:28:30.949 --> 01:28:32.619
Fuck it.

01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:39.403
I gave it a shot.

01:28:46.022 --> 01:28:49.124
What the fuck, man?
Are you serious?

01:28:49.661 --> 01:28:52.348
I really thought
this fucking watch would work.

01:29:01.735 --> 01:29:03.555
Does it slide over you?

01:29:06.732 --> 01:29:11.636
You told Lewenden back in the plane that it...
it slides over you.

01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:15.601
Death.

01:29:19.646 --> 01:29:20.953
That it was warm.

01:29:22.686 --> 01:29:24.741
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

01:29:27.923 --> 01:29:28.962
We carry him.

01:29:29.482 --> 01:29:32.906
We put a litter together,
slide him down the banks.

01:29:39.037 --> 01:29:40.632
I'm not going anywhere, Hendrick.

01:29:42.957 --> 01:29:44.327
I don't want to.

01:29:48.074 --> 01:29:49.820
I don't need to.

01:29:54.311 --> 01:29:58.610
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Is that it? You're just gonna sit there?

01:29:58.743 --> 01:30:00.318
Is that what you want?

01:30:00.352 --> 01:30:01.271
Yeah.

01:30:01.306 --> 01:30:03.507
After what we survived?

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:06.744
That's exactly why.

01:30:10.103 --> 01:30:12.682
What do I got waiting for me back there?

01:30:15.382 --> 01:30:21.138
Gonna sit on a drill all day,
get drunk all night.

01:30:21.698 --> 01:30:23.743
That's my life.

01:30:26.057 --> 01:30:28.875
Turn around and look at that.

01:30:31.534 --> 01:30:33.973
I feel like that's all for me.

01:30:35.373 --> 01:30:37.732
How do I beat that?

01:30:39.450 --> 01:30:41.611
When would it ever be better?

01:30:44.367 --> 01:30:46.039
I can't explain it.

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:52.440
I don't have the words, brother.

01:31:12.035 --> 01:31:13.931
My first name is John.

01:31:23.909 --> 01:31:26.004
My first name is Pete.

01:31:27.068 --> 01:31:28.067
Pete.

01:31:29.668 --> 01:31:31.198
You look like a Pete.

01:31:45.699 --> 01:31:47.259
John Ottway.

01:31:50.298 --> 01:31:52.531
Of course that's your name.

01:31:55.055 --> 01:31:59.413
Thank you, John.
Thank you.

01:32:00.574 --> 01:32:01.572
Thank you.

01:32:09.769 --> 01:32:10.861
Luck.

01:33:29.331 --> 01:33:31.002
I'm not afraid.

01:34:01.158 --> 01:34:02.827
Can I ask you something?

01:34:05.795 --> 01:34:06.836
Yeah.

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:10.052
Where were you going that night?

01:34:10.953 --> 01:34:12.962
That last night in camp,

01:34:14.991 --> 01:34:16.272
at the bar?

01:34:23.507 --> 01:34:25.177
You had your rifle,

01:34:26.026 --> 01:34:27.408
you went out.

01:34:28.625 --> 01:34:30.105
My shift.

01:34:30.106 --> 01:34:31.104
No.

01:34:32.942 --> 01:34:35.640
You worked that morning,
I remember.

01:34:36.741 --> 01:34:38.197
I went out, yeah.

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:42.790
With your rifle.

01:34:50.895 --> 01:34:52.201
Did you follow me?

01:34:55.652 --> 01:34:56.652
No,

01:34:59.731 --> 01:35:03.028
but I never thought
I'd see you alive again.

01:35:05.448 --> 01:35:08.054
Back there with Diaz,

01:35:08.395 --> 01:35:12.925
that look he had.
I've only seen it one other time,

01:35:13.926 --> 01:35:15.925
on you,

01:35:16.532 --> 01:35:18.642
that last night in camp.

01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:33.065
It really doesn't matter now, does it?

01:35:36.443 --> 01:35:38.627
No, I don't suppose it does.

01:35:59.552 --> 01:36:00.993
Hendrick run, run!

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:27.582
Hendrick!

01:36:45.213 --> 01:36:46.213
Hendrick!

01:36:53.608 --> 01:36:54.607
Hendrick!

01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:06.083
Hendrick!

01:37:16.878 --> 01:37:17.957
Hendrick!

01:37:19.957 --> 01:37:20.956
Hendrick!

01:37:25.714 --> 01:37:26.957
Hendrick, hold on!

01:37:31.958 --> 01:37:33.158
Hang on!

01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:35.349
What the fuck are you doing?!

01:37:38.708 --> 01:37:40.114
Look at me!

01:37:45.424 --> 01:37:47.330
Hold your breath!

01:37:47.504 --> 01:37:48.503
Hold your breath!

01:37:51.742 --> 01:37:53.712
Goddammit, hold your breath!

01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:18.610
Jesus, please don't do this!

01:39:43.031 --> 01:39:44.450
Do something.

01:39:48.469 --> 01:39:49.549
Do something.

01:39:53.345 --> 01:39:55.289
You phony prick.

01:39:56.245 --> 01:39:58.764
Fraudulent motherfucker.

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:01.443
Do something!

01:40:02.422 --> 01:40:07.541
Come on! Prove it!
Fuck faith! Earn it!

01:40:08.859 --> 01:40:10.970
Show me something real!

01:40:13.255 --> 01:40:15.854
I need it now,
not later!

01:40:16.136 --> 01:40:17.137
Now!

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:23.060
Show me and I'll believe in you
until the day I die!

01:40:23.292 --> 01:40:25.930
I swear.
I'm calling on you!

01:40:27.931 --> 01:40:29.525
I'm calling on you!

01:40:56.396 --> 01:40:59.761
Fuck it. I'll do it myself.

01:41:06.152 --> 01:41:07.597
I'll do it myself.

01:46:28.965 --> 01:46:30.464
A den.

01:46:32.842 --> 01:46:34.963
It's a fucking den.

01:47:18.002 --> 01:47:19.697
Don't be afraid.

01:48:35.956 --> 01:48:37.849
Once more into the fray.

01:48:39.604 --> 01:48:42.102
Into the last good fight I'll ever know.

01:48:43.622 --> 01:48:46.460
Live and die on this day.

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:52.497
Live and die

01:48:54.998 --> 01:48:57.098
on this day.
