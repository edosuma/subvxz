I seem to have stumbled

So what? It's my face

02:57.560 --> 02:59.430
in front of a mushroom cloud.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.900
It's a wonderful

03:02.930 --> 03:04.770
You're the one who
actually built the damn thing.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.940
But, still,
everybody blames me.

03:07.970 --> 03:11.070
Albert, we have quite a
surprise in store for you.

03:11.110 --> 03:12.840
The only gift I want
from you, Niels,

03:12.880 --> 03:15.710
is an admission that
quantum mechanics is incomplete.

03:15.750 --> 03:17.450
(scoffs) What fun
would that be?

03:17.480 --> 03:20.620
Yes, well, we have to find some
other excuse for our squabbles.

03:20.650 --> 03:23.280
But the current
situation is absurd.

03:23.320 --> 03:27.220
Reality cannot be described by
two theories which do not agree.

03:27.260 --> 03:30.260
Unified field theory is not
the answer though, Albert.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.560
It will be the final
chapter in physics.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.200
You'll see. I will
solve it before I die.

03:36.230 --> 03:38.870
Die? No, you'll never die.
(chuckles)

03:38.900 --> 03:41.700
No, you'll be chiding post grads
long after the sun

03:41.740 --> 03:42.970
has burned itself out.

03:43.010 --> 03:45.540
And besides, it's bad luck
to be so morbid

03:45.570 --> 03:46.970
on one's own birthday.

03:47.010 --> 03:50.380
I have been trying
to tell him that.

03:50.410 --> 03:52.750
Birthdays cause
a man to reflect

03:52.780 --> 03:55.380
on what little he
has accomplished.

03:55.420 --> 03:56.780
You have achieved more

03:56.820 --> 03:59.720
than almost anyone
in human history.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.620
And yet, if I died tomorrow,
I'd be remembered

04:01.660 --> 04:03.790
as the man who ushered
in the nuclear age.

04:03.830 --> 04:06.560
Well, be happy with what
you have accomplished, Albert.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.900
It's quite a lot.

04:08.930 --> 04:10.770
What are you looking for?

04:10.800 --> 04:13.130
My good name. It seems
to have gone missing.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.840
(chuckles)

04:14.870 --> 04:17.070
I'm forming
a council, Oppie.

04:17.110 --> 04:19.510

04:19.540 --> 04:22.140
Albert, you have guests.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.510

04:23.550 --> 04:25.850
If my legacy is to be tied
to the atomic bomb,

04:25.880 --> 04:27.980
it will be
for preventing its use.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.350
I need you to join me.

04:29.390 --> 04:30.620
I'm running the

04:30.650 --> 04:32.150

04:42.830 --> 04:46.630
You? Don't be ridiculous.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.800
It's not safe
for you either, Albert.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.470

04:52.580 --> 04:55.310
Aha. There you are.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.010

05:03.390 --> 05:04.850
Come. Your grandchildren

05:04.890 --> 05:08.020
want to wish you
a happy birthday.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.690

05:24.240 --> 05:25.570
Professor.

05:25.610 --> 05:28.910
Please, everybody.

05:28.940 --> 05:31.580
Our young prodigy here,

it was time to drag you

05:42.260 --> 05:44.490
kicking and screaming
into the modern era.

05:44.530 --> 05:46.190
Many of us here today
are the beneficiaries of

05:46.230 --> 05:47.260
your generosity.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.700
Some of us, like
Dr. Oppenheimer,

05:49.730 --> 05:51.530
are colleagues

05:51.570 --> 05:52.570

05:52.600 --> 05:54.170
Others are

05:54.200 --> 05:56.600
former students
whom you've treated with the...

05:56.640 --> 05:59.440
patience and selflessness
of a father.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.080
(distorting):

TEENAGE HANS:<i> I told you</i>
<i>this was a ridiculous idea.</i>

06:03.780 --> 06:06.180
He isn't coming.

06:06.220 --> 06:08.850
The weather has delayed
the trains. He may come yet.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.850
Eduard was the one who wanted

06:10.890 --> 06:13.090
to go traipsing
through the Alps.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.120
And now he's terribly sick.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.590
Would you like to trade places
with him?

06:18.630 --> 06:21.960
Your father has wanted
a holiday with you

06:22.000 --> 06:23.360
for quite some time.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.770
You owe him at least that.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.800
Why do you make excuses for him?

06:26.840 --> 06:30.440
Because we all make excuses
for ourselves,

06:30.470 --> 06:33.610
and we should be good enough
to make them for others.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.080
People are complex.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.080
So?

06:41.120 --> 06:43.620
You're going
to tell him then?

06:46.090 --> 06:47.220
I don't know.

06:47.260 --> 06:48.790
Mm, it would be one thing

06:48.820 --> 06:50.720
you both have in common.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.890
(applause)
EINSTEIN: Thank you.

06:53.930 --> 06:55.300
Let's have a look at this.
Come on.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.430
We're going. - Ah.
- But Grandpa's present...

06:57.470 --> 06:58.700
Leave it.

07:16.850 --> 07:19.690
Oh. Huh.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.090
Ah.

07:24.130 --> 07:25.530
(chuckles)

07:25.560 --> 07:28.460
A few more items
before you retire.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.870
The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios
are asking

07:30.900 --> 07:32.700
for your approval
for the script they sent.

07:32.740 --> 07:36.100
Is it still a movie about
the making of the atomic bomb?

07:36.140 --> 07:39.040
It is.
- Then I do not approve.

07:39.070 --> 07:42.380
There are a number
of speaking invitations:

07:42.410 --> 07:45.110
uh, Harvard, Cornell,
University of Chicago...

07:45.150 --> 07:47.480
I've decided to accept only one.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.550
Lincoln University.

07:52.690 --> 07:55.520
Do you have an opinion
on this matter?

07:57.230 --> 07:58.790
Of course not.

07:58.830 --> 08:00.330
You never do.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.370
EINSTEIN:
<i>The sun's gravitational pull</i>

08:08.400 --> 08:12.170
is sufficient
to bend light itself.

08:12.210 --> 08:15.640
And bend light it does.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.710
That is how I
finally found proof

08:17.750 --> 08:20.350
of the theory of
general relativity.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.050
Most scientists
thought

08:22.080 --> 08:23.720
I was mad.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.720
Funny, isn't it, how
progress can provoke

08:26.760 --> 08:29.020
such an emotional response?

08:29.060 --> 08:30.690
Though,
of course,

08:30.730 --> 08:34.360
this idea is not foreign
to most of you.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.760
Many believe that young
men such as yourselves

08:36.800 --> 08:40.100
do not deserve the same
opportunities as everyone else.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.600
All because of the color
of your skin.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.110
How absurd.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.340
What do I know
of it? After all,

08:47.380 --> 08:50.240
look at me. I'm an old
white Jew with crazy hair.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.080
(laughter)

08:52.110 --> 08:54.880
But I, too, have
been disparaged

08:54.920 --> 08:56.550
for how I look.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.950
For my heritage.

08:58.990 --> 09:02.620
We all share the same
decent humanity.

09:02.660 --> 09:05.060
The same curiosity.

09:05.090 --> 09:07.400
Hopes, dreams.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.230
The same God.

09:11.270 --> 09:13.430
HOOVER:<i> He consorts</i>
<i>with dangerous types.</i>

09:13.470 --> 09:15.600
Communists, Negroes, anarchists.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.240
I have to say, sir,
I'm surprised

09:17.270 --> 09:19.370
Einstein is the target
of an investigation.

09:19.410 --> 09:21.280
(chuckles)

09:21.310 --> 09:23.710
Einstein's office
is already bugged,

09:23.750 --> 09:26.580
but I have decided
to inject new blood

09:26.620 --> 09:27.580
into this case.

09:27.620 --> 09:28.620
That's why you're here.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.320
This could be a rewarding
stepping stone

09:34.360 --> 09:36.460
for you, McKee.

09:36.490 --> 09:38.990
You'll be on the front lines
in the next war.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.730
War, sir?

09:41.760 --> 09:44.160
Communism is an existential
threat to our great republic,

09:44.200 --> 09:46.730
and Einstein is on the
side of the enemy.

09:46.770 --> 09:48.800
Find what I need

09:48.840 --> 09:51.810
to put this son of a bitch
in jail.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.110
Or...

09:56.150 --> 09:59.750
at least send him
on a one-way trip

09:59.780 --> 10:02.380
back to Germany.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.490
Yes, sir.

10:10.030 --> 10:13.930
(door opens, closes)

10:13.960 --> 10:16.430
Is it worth it, Edgar?

10:16.470 --> 10:20.370
Going after the world's
most famous scientist?

10:26.840 --> 10:28.940
Einstein humiliated me.

10:28.980 --> 10:30.140
Could've lost my job.

10:30.180 --> 10:33.310
I almost did lose my reputation.

10:33.350 --> 10:36.320
What is it that
the scientists say, huh?

10:36.350 --> 10:38.790
For each action

10:38.820 --> 10:40.220
there is an equal

10:40.260 --> 10:42.890
and opposite reaction.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.300
Nuclear weapons
are the obstacle to world peace,

10:54.340 --> 10:56.170
not its solution.

10:56.210 --> 10:58.340
But they exist.

10:58.370 --> 11:01.080
Well, I think the best way
to ensure they're never used

11:01.110 --> 11:03.910
is to give control of them to
the scientists who made them.

11:03.950 --> 11:05.650
Not the American military.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.750
You think the Red Army
is going to leave

11:06.780 --> 11:08.380
the bomb to their scientists?

11:08.420 --> 11:10.420
Harold's right. The Soviets are mad.
Which is why

11:10.450 --> 11:11.820
we must push for containment.

11:11.850 --> 11:13.920
That is a fantasy.
- Exactly.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.560
The U.S. and the Soviets

11:15.590 --> 11:18.990
will continue to build
their nuclear stockpiles.

11:19.030 --> 11:21.200
And perhaps they should.

11:21.230 --> 11:24.870
What the hell are you talking about, Leo?
- Are you crazy?

11:24.900 --> 11:27.070
Perhaps what will
ultimately save us

11:27.100 --> 11:30.240
is two superpowers
with the ability

11:30.270 --> 11:31.370
to completely destroy

11:31.410 --> 11:32.770
one another.

11:32.810 --> 11:36.340
Atomic use leads to
atomic retaliation

11:36.380 --> 11:39.510
and that retaliation
leads to more retaliation

11:39.550 --> 11:42.550
and we end up
at reciprocal annihilation.

11:42.580 --> 11:44.620
Which is why

11:44.650 --> 11:47.790
neither side will ever dare
to use even one weapon.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.720
I cannot believe my ears.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.360
I'm sorry, Leo, but I cannot.

11:52.390 --> 11:55.530
That is lunacy.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.230
Whether by accident

11:57.270 --> 11:58.930
or idiocy or the will
of a tyrant,

11:58.970 --> 12:00.470
these weapons will be used.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.200
And when they are, not even

12:03.240 --> 12:05.040
God can help us.

12:05.070 --> 12:08.710
What is it you suggest, Albert?

12:08.740 --> 12:10.280
A world government.

12:10.310 --> 12:11.880
It would sit on top

12:11.910 --> 12:14.050
of all existing nations

12:14.080 --> 12:15.720
and, as adjudicator

12:15.750 --> 12:18.950
in all disputes,
would make world wars

12:18.990 --> 12:20.120
a thing of history.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.390
No nation would give up

12:21.420 --> 12:22.620
its sovereignty.

12:22.660 --> 12:23.920
We are dealing with a threat

12:23.960 --> 12:26.790
to the basic existence
of humanity.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.960
In my own work, I find

12:30.000 --> 12:33.100
when I'm faced
with an audacious problem,

12:33.140 --> 12:36.900
an audacious solution
is usually the answer.

12:36.940 --> 12:39.410
So let's put
our prodigious heads together

12:39.440 --> 12:41.280
and see
what we can come up with.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.660
SECRETARY:
<i>Professor Bohm to see you?</i>

12:55.690 --> 12:58.090
EINSTEIN:
<i>Of course.</i>

12:58.130 --> 13:00.760
<i>David, come in.</i>

13:00.800 --> 13:02.760
I've just read your paper.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.460
It's remarkable.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.630
Well, hopefully it'll
give you some ammunition

13:06.670 --> 13:08.540
to fire back at the
quantum contingent.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.700
EINSTEIN:<i> It does, and it came</i>
<i>at just the right moment.</i>

13:10.740 --> 13:12.270
<i>I've been stalled</i>

13:12.310 --> 13:15.440
<i>on unified field theory</i>
<i>for months.</i>

13:15.480 --> 13:16.980
BOHM:
<i>So you'll recall the idea</i>

13:17.010 --> 13:19.310
of hidden variables from my paper.
- Ah.

13:19.350 --> 13:23.220
If we assume both a quantum particle,
for example, (phone rings)

13:23.250 --> 13:24.550
an electron,

13:24.590 --> 13:27.150
and a guiding wave
that governs its motion...

13:29.390 --> 13:32.490
(sighs) He's not at
the office, either.

13:32.530 --> 13:34.860
HANS ALBERT:
<i>I've been admitted</i>

13:34.900 --> 13:37.530
to Zurich Polytechnic.

13:37.570 --> 13:40.800
I'll be following
in your footsteps.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.040
This is wonderful.

13:45.340 --> 13:47.910
This will be
an extraordinary adventure.

13:49.610 --> 13:52.210
Engineering?

13:52.250 --> 13:53.480
But why?

13:53.520 --> 13:56.480
Engineering is the future, Papa.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.490
No.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.660
You've been sold a story.

14:01.690 --> 14:03.860
It isn't science.

14:03.890 --> 14:05.330
It's tinkering.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.230
Tinkering?

14:07.260 --> 14:09.060
Hans, trust me.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.400
This is beneath you.

14:10.430 --> 14:12.670
You have a gift.
You've always excelled

14:12.700 --> 14:14.170
in science.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.700
Target your ambitions,

14:15.740 --> 14:17.270
and then aim higher.

14:17.310 --> 14:18.710
Engineering is my ambition.

14:18.740 --> 14:20.240
It isn't science, Hans.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.040
I don't want you

14:22.080 --> 14:24.340
to give up on science
like your mother did.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.110
Give up?

14:26.150 --> 14:28.620
She sacrificed herself
for all of us.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.950
For you, most of all.

14:29.990 --> 14:31.290
She's no martyr, Hans.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.350
She made her own choices.

14:33.390 --> 14:36.860
Don't squander your talents
like she did.

14:36.890 --> 14:39.730
There are nobler pursuits
for a brain like yours.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.830
No, you mean
a brain like yours, Papa.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.970
I want to do
something different.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.080
Ah. It's days like today, Helen,
that I'm reminded

14:56.110 --> 14:59.710
that science
is primitive and childlike.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.620
Thank God for that.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.920
What is it?

15:30.150 --> 15:31.510
Thank you.

15:39.350 --> 15:42.490
I'm sorry for your loss, my boy.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.660
My loss?

15:47.130 --> 15:49.700
That's an interesting way
to put it.

15:54.670 --> 15:56.800
Tell me,
what were you doing earlier?

15:56.840 --> 15:59.140
Before I arrived.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.110
I was working.

16:01.140 --> 16:04.540
And yesterday
when I couldn't reach you?

16:04.580 --> 16:06.810
I was at the office.

16:06.850 --> 16:07.980
No, I called the office.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.350
There was no answer.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.950
There are moments
when I get absorbed

16:10.990 --> 16:13.490
in what I'm doing, Hans.
You know that.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.490
Yes, I certainly do.

16:18.830 --> 16:21.730
But I have always
hoped that once--

16:21.760 --> 16:24.530
just once in my life--

16:24.570 --> 16:27.200
you'd be absorbed
with your family

16:27.240 --> 16:28.670
instead of your work.

16:32.770 --> 16:34.740
But we're just a burden to you.

16:34.780 --> 16:37.540
That's not fair, Hans.
- Isn't it?

16:37.580 --> 16:40.850
I think you're relieved
she's dead.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.380
How could you
say such a thing?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.490
You'll never again have to worry
about her money problems

16:45.520 --> 16:48.320
or feel guilt
for what became of her.

16:48.360 --> 16:52.090
I thought we had put aside
all this bitterness years ago.

16:52.130 --> 16:54.160
That is because
you are completely oblivious

16:54.200 --> 16:56.260
to the feelings
of those closest to you, Papa.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.770
You're so kind
to so many people.

17:04.410 --> 17:06.570
But you have been so cruel

17:06.610 --> 17:08.880
to your own family.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.950
I have accepted
a teaching position at Berkeley.

17:18.990 --> 17:21.120
We won't have to see
each other again.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.560
Hans, wait.

17:22.590 --> 17:25.890
Don't leave like this.

17:25.930 --> 17:27.290
Not today.

17:27.330 --> 17:28.630
You treated her miserably,

17:28.660 --> 17:30.100
and you should be ashamed.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.800
I'm only angry with myself

17:33.840 --> 17:36.140
for taking this long
to say that to your face.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.480
Don't contact me, Papa.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.420
Ever.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.060
<i>The neutron itself</i>
<i>was discovered</i>

18:01.100 --> 18:03.430
<i>by Chadwick, an Englishman.</i>

18:03.470 --> 18:06.070
<i>The cyclotron by Lawrence,</i>
<i>an American.</i>

18:06.100 --> 18:08.270
<i>And the splitting of uranium</i>

18:08.300 --> 18:11.140
<i>was detected by Hahn, a German.</i>

18:11.170 --> 18:14.410
<i>Don't blame it all on me.</i>

18:14.440 --> 18:16.180
MAN:
<i>Would it be possible for you</i>

18:16.210 --> 18:19.150
<i>to go and see</i>
<i>President Roosevelt yourself?</i>

18:19.180 --> 18:22.120
<i>But I have a cold.</i>
<i>And besides,</i>

18:22.150 --> 18:23.850
<i>I do not know</i>

18:23.890 --> 18:26.190
<i>Mr. Roosevelt very well.</i>

18:26.220 --> 18:29.420
<i>I'm sure the president</i>
<i>knows you, sir.</i>

18:29.460 --> 18:31.020
EINSTEIN:
<i>It will be more polite</i>

18:31.060 --> 18:33.590
<i>if I just write him a letter.</i>

18:33.630 --> 18:34.630
MAN:
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

18:36.060 --> 18:38.630
EINSTEIN:
<i>The acting was abominable.</i>

18:38.670 --> 18:41.130
The science, completely wrong.

18:41.170 --> 18:43.970
And I don't really talk
like that, do I?

18:44.010 --> 18:46.440
Well, at least they implemented

18:46.470 --> 18:48.140
some of the changes
you proposed.

18:48.180 --> 18:49.840
Well, to my mind,
it certainly didn't improve...

18:52.310 --> 18:55.180
Oh.
- Professor?

18:55.220 --> 18:57.050
(grunts)

18:57.090 --> 19:00.390
The pain is likely due
to an aneurysm of the aorta.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.490
Basically a small bulge
in the artery.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.220
Is it serious?

19:04.260 --> 19:06.060
Not if he doesn't smoke,
cuts out sweets

19:06.090 --> 19:07.830
and avoids
strenuous activity.

19:07.860 --> 19:10.800
That does include
sexual congress, Dr. Einstein.

19:10.830 --> 19:13.330
I see. To live long,
I must forego

19:13.370 --> 19:14.870
anything worth living for.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.210
(chuckles)

19:22.440 --> 19:23.810
EINSTEIN:
<i>David.</i>

19:23.850 --> 19:25.750
Where is everybody?

19:25.780 --> 19:27.480
They're terrified,
Albert.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.720
Of what?

19:28.750 --> 19:31.290
This.
It's a subpoena.

19:34.760 --> 19:38.690
The Un-American Activities
Committee.

19:38.730 --> 19:40.260
What could be more un-American

19:40.300 --> 19:43.230
than an inquisition?

19:43.270 --> 19:45.930
I'm scared, Albert.

19:45.970 --> 19:48.100
You'll be all
right, David.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.400
You have the First Amendment
in this country.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.510
Stand up.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.870
Tell the truth.
Say, "Yes, I was a communist."

19:54.910 --> 19:56.640
It is not illegal
to have been one.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.520
And then what?

20:02.550 --> 20:05.290
I-I won't be able
to get a job.

20:05.320 --> 20:06.550
I'll be ruined.

20:06.590 --> 20:09.290
They cannot force you to speak.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.630
MAN:
<i>Mr. Bohm,</i>

20:11.660 --> 20:14.130
are you now,
or have you ever been

20:14.160 --> 20:17.400
a member of
the Communist Party?

20:22.100 --> 20:23.740
On the...
(camera shutter clicks)

20:26.840 --> 20:29.910
On the advice of counsel,

20:29.940 --> 20:32.880
I invoke my right
under the Fifth Amendment

20:32.910 --> 20:36.450
not to answer, on the grounds
I may incriminate myself.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.350
(excited murmurs)
Order! Order!

20:41.820 --> 20:43.390
How could those bastards
suspend a man

20:43.430 --> 20:44.720
for attending
a few meetings?

20:44.760 --> 20:46.890
You know it's
out of my hands.

20:46.930 --> 20:48.060
I'll offer to
pay his salary.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.260
He can be my
personal assistant.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.760
Albert...

20:50.800 --> 20:53.430
If David Bohm sets foot
on the Institute's grounds,

20:53.470 --> 20:55.070
he will be arrested
for trespassing.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.640
And you and I will
soon thereafter be

20:57.670 --> 20:59.140
polishing our résumés.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.640
The United States
government

21:00.680 --> 21:02.780
sees Bohm as a threat,

21:02.810 --> 21:06.280
and no matter what
its flaws...

21:06.310 --> 21:08.180
I still believe a man

21:08.220 --> 21:10.950
must put his country first.

21:10.990 --> 21:12.120
You are a coward.
- Albert.

21:12.150 --> 21:13.990
This is a man's life.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.860
If we sit on our hands,
they'll come after us next.

21:17.890 --> 21:19.760
They want to intimidate
us into silence.

21:19.790 --> 21:22.300
That way we become
easier prey.

21:22.330 --> 21:24.760
Don't do anything
rash, Albert.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.670
Don't worry, whatever I do
will be quite deliberate.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.500
You think it's foolish,
I know.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.810
Yet again,
I'm inviting controversy.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.040
So why not say it,
just this once?

21:37.180 --> 21:40.150
You truly are
a sphinx, Helen.

21:40.180 --> 21:42.980
Elsa had opinions, advice.
Elsa had strategy.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.380
I am not Elsa.

21:44.420 --> 21:45.950
No, you certainly
are not.

21:45.990 --> 21:48.190
The only thing
you show enthusiasm for

21:48.220 --> 21:50.790
is keeping my pipe from me.

21:50.830 --> 21:52.490
You haven't seen it, have you?

21:52.530 --> 21:55.160
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT:
<i>Hello and welcome.</i>

21:55.200 --> 21:57.630
I'm Eleanor Roosevelt.

21:57.670 --> 21:59.300
On today's program,

21:59.330 --> 22:01.400
I'll present a special segment

22:01.440 --> 22:03.500
from renowned physicist

22:03.540 --> 22:05.870
Albert Einstein.

22:05.910 --> 22:08.580
EINSTEIN:
Good evening.

22:08.610 --> 22:11.640
The arms race
between the United States

22:11.680 --> 22:14.310
and the Soviet Union

22:14.350 --> 22:17.520
has assumed
hysterical proportions.

22:17.550 --> 22:20.690
<i>On both sides,</i>
<i>means of mass destruction</i>

22:20.720 --> 22:23.860
<i>are being perfected</i>
<i>with feverish haste,</i>

22:23.890 --> 22:27.760
<i>and behind walls of secrecy.</i>

22:27.800 --> 22:31.000
<i>And now the production</i>
<i>of the hydrogen bomb</i>

22:31.030 --> 22:32.370
<i>will be accomplished.</i>

22:32.400 --> 22:35.870
If these efforts
prove successful,

22:35.900 --> 22:38.270
annihilation
of all life on Earth

22:38.310 --> 22:40.370
will have been
brought within the range

22:40.410 --> 22:42.340
of what is possible.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.040
<i>Outside the United States</i>

22:44.080 --> 22:46.280
<i>we establish military bases.</i>

22:46.310 --> 22:48.780
<i>Inside the United States...</i>

22:50.790 --> 22:53.420
<i>Inside the United States,</i>

22:53.460 --> 22:56.290
<i>the loyalty of citizens</i>
<i>is carefully supervised</i>

22:56.320 --> 22:59.960
<i>by a police force growing more</i>
<i>powerful every day.</i>

23:01.730 --> 23:05.300
<i>People of independent thought</i>
<i>are being harassed.</i>

23:05.330 --> 23:08.570
<i>The public is indoctrinated.</i>

23:08.600 --> 23:10.840
Get me McKee.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.950
With one television interview

23:21.980 --> 23:24.750
he humiliated the Bureau.

23:24.790 --> 23:27.150
We must move on him

23:27.190 --> 23:29.160
before he does
more damage.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.830
I'm doing all I can, sir.
- Do more.

23:31.860 --> 23:34.830
<i>Search his mail,</i>
<i>tap his home phone,</i>

23:34.860 --> 23:37.330
<i>follow his acquaintances.</i>

23:37.370 --> 23:40.300
<i>You have discretion to do</i>

23:40.340 --> 23:42.240
<i>whatever it takes.</i>

23:42.270 --> 23:43.600
McKEE:<i> I'm just wondering</i>
<i>what evidence</i>

23:43.640 --> 23:45.640
persuaded a judge
to sign a warrant

23:45.670 --> 23:47.770
for such an extensive operation.

23:47.810 --> 23:48.980
We cannot wait

23:49.010 --> 23:52.110

to my previous

24:32.520 --> 24:34.790

24:34.820 --> 24:36.820
because this wave can influence
a quantum particle

24:36.860 --> 24:38.560

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Yes.

24:42.530 --> 24:45.630

of physics accepts my work,

24:45.670 --> 24:47.200
the more you resist it.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.500

quantum mechanics

what do you have to show
for all this time

25:07.520 --> 25:10.860

25:14.400 --> 25:15.700

37:37.200 --> 37:39.970

Dr. Einstein?

37:53.220 --> 37:56.990
BOHR: Rumors of an
Einstein sighting on campus

37:57.020 --> 37:58.590
made waves very quickly.

37:58.630 --> 38:00.660
Had to come see if it was true.

38:00.690 --> 38:03.300
How are you, Niels?

38:03.330 --> 38:05.760
In my own little world,
marking time.

38:05.800 --> 38:09.600
It's good to see
you're back at work.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.440
I'm muddling my way through
unified field theory again.

38:12.470 --> 38:13.870
Oh.

38:17.810 --> 38:19.480
You know, there...

38:19.510 --> 38:23.350
there is a bit of an anomaly
i-in your work.

38:23.380 --> 38:26.220
I beg your pardon?

38:26.250 --> 38:28.390
That-that, uh, derivative?

38:28.420 --> 38:30.220
It can't be third order.

38:34.900 --> 38:36.460
(quietly):
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.530
Yeah. Hmm.

38:38.570 --> 38:40.570
(mumbling)

38:43.400 --> 38:45.340
What anomaly?

38:56.220 --> 38:57.850
My God, you're right.

38:57.890 --> 38:59.180
(chuckles)

38:59.220 --> 39:01.490
I'd have gone on
fumbling my way through that

39:01.520 --> 39:03.260
for another week if you
hadn't pointed it out.

39:03.290 --> 39:04.890
Yes.

39:07.130 --> 39:08.790
Ah.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.330
How about a stroll?

39:11.370 --> 39:13.370
Ah. (chuckles)

39:15.970 --> 39:17.940
<i>I read the manifesto you</i>

39:17.970 --> 39:19.100
and Bertrand Russell wrote.

39:19.140 --> 39:20.840
It was very impressive.

39:20.870 --> 39:22.780
And yet no one listens.

39:22.810 --> 39:26.780
I fear my influence on the use
of atomic weapons is long past.

39:28.380 --> 39:30.880
If only I could turn back
the clock to when people

39:30.920 --> 39:33.020
actually cared about
what I had to say.

39:33.050 --> 39:35.020
Well, time travel.

39:35.060 --> 39:38.890
Perhaps that could be
your final triumph, Albert.

39:38.930 --> 39:42.590
There are many moments
I'd like to relive

39:42.630 --> 39:45.630
and many ills
I'd like to fix.

39:45.670 --> 39:48.630
Time is a tricky thing.

39:48.670 --> 39:50.370
You taught me that.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.910
People have missed you here,
Albert.

39:53.940 --> 39:56.810
Purely selfish on their part,
to be sure,

39:56.840 --> 39:58.480
but they need you

39:58.510 --> 40:01.080
to keep their minds sharp.

40:01.110 --> 40:03.050
Well, I need you.

40:03.080 --> 40:05.790
Not just to keep my
mind sharp, but...

40:07.290 --> 40:08.790
...for this.

40:12.260 --> 40:13.790
What are you looking for?

40:13.830 --> 40:16.060
Uh, an equation.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.600
Well, half-formed.

40:18.630 --> 40:19.970
It's more of a scribble.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.340
Maybe ten, 15 years old.

40:23.370 --> 40:25.440
If you can give me

40:25.470 --> 40:27.440
anything else to go on?

40:27.470 --> 40:28.910
It must be here.

40:28.940 --> 40:30.180
It's very important.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.380

40:54.670 --> 40:57.670
♪ ♪

41:04.180 --> 41:05.310
You kept these?

41:05.350 --> 41:06.310

41:06.350 --> 41:09.650

You have a visitor.

41:32.870 --> 41:34.040
EINSTEIN: Oh.

41:34.070 --> 41:36.510
Hello, Alice.

41:37.740 --> 41:39.710
Thank you, Helen.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.910
So I looked up
that "Finobacci" thing

41:41.950 --> 41:43.650
in the Encyclopedia Britannica.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.480
Here's what I don't get.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.190
The flowers, how do
they know the math?

41:48.220 --> 41:49.890
I mean, does a flower realize

41:49.920 --> 41:51.860
it's supposed to have
a certain number of petals?

41:51.890 --> 41:54.160
And why the heck
does it care, anyway?

41:54.190 --> 41:56.530
That's a very
interesting question, Alice.

41:56.560 --> 42:00.070
Hmm. Let me
show you something.

42:00.100 --> 42:04.100
I think I might find
an answer for that.

42:11.040 --> 42:13.450
I'm sure it's in
this book somewhere.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.880
What's this thing?

42:23.660 --> 42:24.990
That was a gift...

42:26.760 --> 42:28.630
...from my grandchildren.

42:32.430 --> 42:33.900
It's strange.

42:33.930 --> 42:37.440
If you hadn't noticed it, I...

42:37.470 --> 42:40.570
might have forgotten it existed.

42:40.610 --> 42:43.610
That's probably because
you're getting old.

42:44.950 --> 42:46.450
Hmm.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.610
Finished already?

42:48.650 --> 42:50.220
He said he's not feeling well.

42:50.250 --> 42:51.780
Asked me to come back tomorrow.

42:51.820 --> 42:54.320
So, see you later, I guess.

43:07.630 --> 43:10.500
Are you all right?

43:10.540 --> 43:12.100
I'm fine.

43:16.540 --> 43:17.880
It's time.

43:21.050 --> 43:23.280
For what?

43:23.320 --> 43:24.850
Call him.

43:26.350 --> 43:28.420
That door is closed.

43:28.460 --> 43:29.620
Are you really such a fool?

43:29.660 --> 43:31.090
I'm a realist.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.960
I know when there's
nothing more to be done.

43:33.990 --> 43:36.600
I see.

43:36.630 --> 43:39.770
And yet you never gave up
on nuclear proliferation.

43:39.800 --> 43:42.000
You did not find it

43:42.040 --> 43:44.440
too daunting
to speak at a Negro college

43:44.470 --> 43:47.340
when no one else would dare,

43:47.370 --> 43:49.640
or to defend convicted spies.

43:52.750 --> 43:54.550
You have compassion

43:54.580 --> 43:57.550
for so many people.

43:57.580 --> 43:59.120
You fight

43:59.150 --> 44:02.220
for so many people.

44:02.260 --> 44:03.660
Why is it you cannot fight

44:03.690 --> 44:06.360
to be reconciled
with your own son?

44:09.230 --> 44:11.130
I think I liked you better

44:11.160 --> 44:13.500
when you kept your thoughts
to yourself.

44:15.570 --> 44:17.800
I am certain you did.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.910
Hans told me
that he wants nothing more

44:20.940 --> 44:22.170
to do with me.

44:22.210 --> 44:25.640
You care so much
about your legacy,

44:25.680 --> 44:28.010
about how you
will be remembered

44:28.050 --> 44:29.650
by the world,

44:29.680 --> 44:32.820
but the world begins and ends

44:32.850 --> 44:35.290
in your own family.

44:52.770 --> 44:56.280
Hello, Hansie.

45:09.590 --> 45:11.160
Come in, my boy.

45:13.130 --> 45:15.560
HANS: You're helping
a ten-year-old girl...

45:15.600 --> 45:18.460
with long division?

45:18.500 --> 45:19.830
She's very bright.

45:22.300 --> 45:25.700
You're good with other people,

45:25.740 --> 45:27.440
with your colleagues,

45:27.470 --> 45:29.110
the cleaning woman,
taxi drivers.

45:32.750 --> 45:35.210
But you made<i> me...</i>

45:35.250 --> 45:37.280
feel inferior.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.720
EINSTEIN:
When I was young,

45:42.760 --> 45:45.990
my father told me that physics
was a waste of time.

45:46.030 --> 45:49.060
I only realized

45:49.100 --> 45:50.600
at the end of his life

45:50.630 --> 45:54.400
that he wasn't being cruel.

45:54.430 --> 45:56.100
He was terrified for me.

45:58.710 --> 46:00.710
And I forgave him for it...

46:04.880 --> 46:08.210
...only too late.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.650
I'm proud of you, Hans.

46:14.690 --> 46:17.120
I hope you know that.

46:18.890 --> 46:21.130
You're a brilliant engineer.

Bernard, it's your turn, go.

What about Eduard?

46:37.580 --> 46:41.180
I love Eduard as I love you.

46:43.920 --> 46:47.320
I wish I could've
spent more time

46:47.350 --> 46:48.850
with both of you.

46:53.230 --> 46:55.390
And Mother?

46:55.430 --> 46:58.930
You made her feel
inconsequential, Papa.

47:00.900 --> 47:03.240
You told me she wasted her life.

47:05.840 --> 47:09.640
Your mother was the blood
in my veins,

47:09.680 --> 47:12.080
but I was the thorn in her side.

47:15.550 --> 47:18.020
She was a great scientist, Hans,

47:18.050 --> 47:21.750
insatiably curious.

47:25.560 --> 47:29.390
I would never have achieved
anything without her.

47:35.240 --> 47:37.600
She was the love of my life.
