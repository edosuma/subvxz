Hey, Grandma!

00:03.294 --> 00:04.212
Still doing that puzzle?

00:04.295 --> 00:06.256
Yep! 5,000 pieces,

00:06.339 --> 00:08.216
three months of my life.

00:08.299 --> 00:09.217
But my doctor says,

00:09.300 --> 00:11.219
puzzles help reduce stress.

00:11.302 --> 00:14.431
Why... won't... you. Fit?!

00:14.514 --> 00:16.433
Wanna help?

00:16.516 --> 00:18.226
Uh...

00:18.309 --> 00:20.395

a one-person thing.

Oh! Hey!

00:25.692 --> 00:28.153
Vuuugle House just
got two comped tickets

00:28.236 --> 00:30.363
for a concert by someone named...

00:30.447 --> 00:31.573
DJ Miss Jockey?

00:31.656 --> 00:32.699
[spits]

00:33.283 --> 00:35.577
DJ Miss Jockey?
Are you serious?

00:35.660 --> 00:38.496
DJ Miss Jockey is,
like, our favorite DJ.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.498
She used to be
DJ Mrs. Jockey,

00:40.582 --> 00:42.625
but things between her
and DJ Mr. Jockey

00:42.709 --> 00:44.878
didn't work out.
It's a long story.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.463
That wasn't the long story?

00:48.214 --> 00:49.257
Can Paige and I have the tickets?

00:49.341 --> 00:50.633
[both] Please? Please, please, please!

00:50.717 --> 00:51.926
I'll make you a deal.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.470
There's a bunch of stuff
around this house

00:53.553 --> 00:54.471
that needs to get done.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.222
Do it, and you can
have the tickets

00:56.306 --> 00:58.016
to DJ Stupid Name or whatever.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.477
-Yay!
-No deal.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.730
Uh, hang on.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.440
Uh, dude!

01:05.523 --> 01:06.608
What are you doing?

01:06.691 --> 01:08.443
I'm not cleaning the
house to get those tickets.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.278
We'll get them
the old-fashioned way.

01:10.362 --> 01:11.696
Wait till Grandma falls asleep,

01:11.780 --> 01:13.865
then steal 'em!

01:13.948 --> 01:15.241
Frankie, we can't do that.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.451
You're right.
They're e-tickets.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.286
We'll have to steal her phone.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.455
No, there's a lesson here.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.290
There are no
shortcuts in life.

01:22.374 --> 01:25.418
Yeah, yeah.
Is there a shorter version of this lesson?

01:25.502 --> 01:28.129
Frankie, Grandma offered us a fair deal.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.547
Let's do the work,
and we'll get the tickets.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.341
-[sighs] Fine.
-Yay!

01:31.424 --> 01:32.258
Grandma?

01:32.342 --> 01:34.386
You got a deal!

01:34.469 --> 01:36.388
All right, I'll start
cleaning the studio.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.890
-Um, you take care of the kitchen.
-Okay.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.685
I can... feel... the stress...
melting... away!

01:41.768 --> 01:44.187
Bernie, are you sure
you don't wanna help?

very important work.

to wash my hands?

Of course you can, Willow.

Bernie, what the heck?

02:34.404 --> 02:36.906
I just asked you the
exact same thing she did.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.033
Did you?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.200
When you asked, all I heard was...

02:39.284 --> 02:40.702
[growling]

02:40.785 --> 02:43.121
But when she asked,
all I heard was...

02:43.204 --> 02:44.873
Aw!

02:48.084 --> 02:49.711
Interesting.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.546
Hey, Willow? I was, uh,

02:51.629 --> 02:53.173
I was wondering if
you could do me a favor.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.883
I love favors!

02:54.966 --> 02:57.052
They're my third favorite

unexpected compliments

02:59.888 --> 03:01.973
and starting
infectious giggle fits.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.769
Great, because it
would really help me out

03:05.852 --> 03:08.730
if you could ask Horse Face Guy
to take out the trash.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.399
-Why?
-Excellent question.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.401
See, I would do it,

03:13.485 --> 03:15.278
but, uh, I just wanna do more

03:15.362 --> 03:17.113
important things
with my time, you know?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.990
There are a lot
of important things

03:19.074 --> 03:19.991
to do around here.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.660
Like, have you thought
about how this house

03:22.744 --> 03:24.829
doesn't have
a water conservation plan?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.998
Have I!

03:27.082 --> 03:29.042
That's exactly
what I was referring to

important things!

03:30.877 --> 03:32.003
-Great!

03:46.059 --> 03:47.894
Wow! That was infectious.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.106
Excuse me, Horse Face Guy?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.650
I can see you're super busy,

03:53.733 --> 03:55.735
but do you mind
taking out the garbage?

04:11.835 --> 04:14.170

to come down here,

but the spelling was horrible!

04:16.006 --> 04:17.257
Cut me a break!

04:17.340 --> 04:19.467
It's really hard to press
the letters with my crutches.

still work, right?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.806
Well, that'll make

Anyweezy, I wanna
show you something.

I started my own channel

04:31.771 --> 04:33.523
-No.
-Well...

04:33.606 --> 04:34.566
ever since I broke my foot,

04:34.649 --> 04:35.692
I've been looking
for new hobbies,

04:35.775 --> 04:36.860
where I don't have
to move around as much.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.529
And you know how you always said I should
write a song about myself?

04:39.612 --> 04:41.614
-No.
-Well...

04:41.698 --> 04:44.034
I did, and you're welcome.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.869
The song's called
"Crutchin' It,"

04:45.952 --> 04:47.537

keeping me from, uh,

on a rainbow hunt,

some stuff around.

I thought tonight we could do
a make-your-own-taco bar.

I could whip up some
of my famous guac.

gives me acid reflux,

considering it.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.915
Francine Hildegard Wong!

09:41.998 --> 09:42.832
[gasps]

09:43.083 --> 09:44.125
We agreed we'd only
use middle names

09:44.250 --> 09:45.293
in case of an emergency!

09:45.377 --> 09:46.920
Well, this is an emergency.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.421
A moral emergency!

09:48.505 --> 09:49.964
That doesn't feel
like a real thing!

09:50.048 --> 09:51.800
Neither does
the name "Hildegard."

09:51.883 --> 09:52.717
[gasps]

09:53.426 --> 09:56.012
Willow's cuteness is not a tool.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.389
You can't use her
at your convenience

09:57.472 --> 09:58.348
to get out of doing things!

09:58.431 --> 09:59.432
Fine!

09:59.516 --> 10:01.226
What I did was wrong,

10:01.309 --> 10:02.519
and I should be
ashamed of myself.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.396
Good! Now go to your room,

10:04.479 --> 10:06.064
and think about
what you've done!

10:06.147 --> 10:07.315
I will think about
what I've done,

10:07.399 --> 10:08.566
but I won't go to my room.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.777
I'm going to the back deck
to stare at the ocean!

10:10.860 --> 10:13.780
Good idea!
It's magnificent this time of day!

10:14.823 --> 10:15.949
-Hey, Paige!
-[shouts] What do you want?!

10:16.032 --> 10:17.742
Sorry. [shouts]
What do you want?

10:17.826 --> 10:18.993
Sorry. [normal voice]
What do you want?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.205
Well, ever since
I broke my foot,

10:22.288 --> 10:23.915
I've been looking
for new hobbies

10:23.998 --> 10:24.916
to keep myself busy,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.793
since all my current
fave activities,

10:26.876 --> 10:28.086
require the use of my full bod.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.422
That's great, Bernie.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.841
Finding new hobbies is one
of the greatest joys in life.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.801
I knew you'd be
supportive, Paige.

10:34.884 --> 10:35.844
You always are!

10:35.927 --> 10:37.012
Which is why
I was wondering

10:37.095 --> 10:38.972
if you'd be my
crutch-art model.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.182
Crutch what?

10:41.266 --> 10:43.143
It's a new art form,
where I paint with my crutches.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.062
All you have to do is sit
still for three to ten hours,

10:46.146 --> 10:47.897
while I dip my
crutches in paint,

10:47.981 --> 10:49.858
and create your
portrait on a canvas.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.318
Three to ten hours?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.946
I know! Someone who loves art
as much as you

10:55.030 --> 10:56.906
would give three to ten days,

10:56.990 --> 10:59.200
but I want to be
considerate of your time.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.246
-So you'll do it?
-[chuckles] Will I do it?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.957
I will definitely...

11:06.041 --> 11:08.043
and by that, I mean,

11:08.126 --> 11:11.046
that I can, uh,
I can certainly--

11:11.129 --> 11:13.798
Uh, hey, Willow!

11:31.358 --> 11:33.860

11:36.196 --> 11:37.864
What is happening?!

11:39.074 --> 11:41.951
The key to making
a great apple pie

11:42.035 --> 11:43.161
is the crumble.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.955
My secret is crushed walnuts.

11:46.039 --> 11:46.998
Watch.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.500
[crunching]

12:06.935 --> 12:07.977
Finished!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.145
And Marcus
at the puzzle store

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
said I didn't have the guts.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.983
This is better than
the birth of my grandson.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.029
[groans]
I've had the worst song

12:18.113 --> 12:19.364
stuck in my head all day,

12:19.447 --> 12:21.324
and I can't stop singing it!

12:21.408 --> 12:23.159
Well, if you can't
stop singing it,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.078
doesn't that mean
it's a good song?

12:26.955 --> 12:28.081
Maybe you're right.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.461
Does this mean Bernie is
some kind of musical genius?

12:41.886 --> 12:42.971
[Frankie thinking]
<i>Lousy Bernie.</i>

12:43.054 --> 12:44.931

<i>Nah, Willow's not lousy.</i>

12:52.022 --> 12:53.106
<i>She's adorable!</i>

12:54.274 --> 12:55.859
Stop moving, Frankie.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.236
My crutch art requires
absolute stillness.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.238
Bernie, can you,
uh, hurry this up?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.115
I can't breathe in this thing.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.287
Hold it.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.373
Just one...

13:10.457 --> 13:12.208

13:17.380 --> 13:18.965
-Bernie?
-Huh? Oh.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.133
I'm done.
Were you waiting on me?

13:20.216 --> 13:21.051
[groans]

13:21.926 --> 13:23.845
Thanks for posing
for me, Frankie.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.306
You really helped me out,
since Paige wasn't available.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.059
Paige wasn't available?

13:30.185 --> 13:31.269
No, it's weird.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.313
She usually helps me
out with stuff like this.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.149
Yeah, she does.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.901
And where perchance

13:37.984 --> 13:40.195
did Miss Olvera say
she was this fine evening?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.239
Uh, I don't know.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.908
She wasn't the one
who told me she was busy.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.951
Well, then, who, pray tell, told you?

13:47.035 --> 13:49.204
-Willow.
-Oh no, she didn't!

13:51.081 --> 13:52.290
Thanks again, Frankie!

13:52.374 --> 13:54.376
I think this is my
best portrait yet.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.923
It's like she's
still in the room.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.095
-Paige Hypocrite Olvera!
-[gasps]

14:05.178 --> 14:07.180
Yeah, I know it's not your
middle name, but it fits.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.598
Also, I forgot your real one.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.935
-It's Dana.
-Right! That's why I forgot!

14:12.018 --> 14:14.437
Stand and answer
for your crimes, woman!

14:14.521 --> 14:17.273
-Uh...
-You used Willow for your dirty work!

14:17.357 --> 14:19.150
The same thing
you yelled at me for

14:19.234 --> 14:21.528
a mere three
to ten hours ago!

14:21.611 --> 14:23.947
But I only asked
for Willow's help once!

14:24.030 --> 14:26.157
Do you know how sweaty
my torso is in this thing?

14:26.241 --> 14:28.118
Do you? Do you?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.119
Do you?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.079
-Get that thing out of my face!
-[Frankie screams]

14:34.040 --> 14:35.208

-Okay! I'm trying!

14:37.335 --> 14:39.045
-I'm trying!
-You're making it worse!

Hurry!

14:40.380 --> 14:41.381
[both grunting]

14:50.056 --> 14:53.018
Oh, no.
Grandma worked for months on this.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.270
She's gonna bury me in this dress!

14:56.396 --> 14:58.231
She's never gonna give us
those concert tickets now.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.066
She's gonna lose it, Frankie.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.359
Her temper's even
worse than yours!

15:01.443 --> 15:03.278
[shouting]
I don't have a temper, Paige!

15:05.238 --> 15:06.364
Sorry, it's this dress.

15:06.448 --> 15:09.159
Was every woman in the old days
mad all the time?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.994
Yes, but it wasn't
just the dresses.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.495
We weren't allowed to vote,
we couldn't own property.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.330
Lots of people thought
we were witches!

15:14.414 --> 15:17.334
Paige. Paige, you know
I'm with you on this, but the puzzle.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.044
Okay, yeah.
You're right, I'm done.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.005
We've come a long way,
but we still have a long way to go.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.673
Okay, now I'm done.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.217
What are we gonna
do about the puzzle?

15:27.344 --> 15:29.262
Well...

15:29.346 --> 15:31.014
there is one thing
we can do.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.099
You're not suggesting...?

15:33.183 --> 15:34.392
We can ask Willow...

15:34.476 --> 15:36.394
To talk to Grandma...

15:36.478 --> 15:38.396
And take the heat for this.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.231
Just one last time,
and then we'll never ask her

15:40.315 --> 15:41.399
to do anything
for us ever again.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.109
It's our only option.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.196
I take solace in
knowing that deep down

15:46.279 --> 15:47.113
we're both bad people.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.122
Okay, so I take the blame
for breaking the puzzle,

15:56.206 --> 15:57.415
but Grandma won't punish me

15:57.499 --> 16:00.126
like she would
you two because...

16:00.210 --> 16:03.129
Uh, because you're
stinkin' adorable!

16:03.213 --> 16:04.214
Guilty!

16:05.382 --> 16:06.383
And I'm happy to help!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.385
After all,
if you got grounded,

16:08.468 --> 16:10.387
you wouldn't be able
to go to the animal shelter

16:10.470 --> 16:12.222
and collect excrement,

16:12.305 --> 16:14.057
so you can fertilize the park.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.725
You know, like you promised.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.603
Yeah, we love
spreading "extra mints."

16:18.687 --> 16:20.271
Excrement! It means "poop."

16:20.355 --> 16:23.149
Oof! That's not keeping
anyone's breath fresh.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.485
Now remember, you're
really gonna have

16:25.568 --> 16:27.278
to amp up the cute factor
for Grandma.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.406
-Why?
-'Cause she cray.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.242
In that case,

16:32.325 --> 16:33.451
I'd better
turn it up a notch.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.163
[gasps] What if I turn my "R"s
and "L"s into "W"s?

You broke my puzzle?

17:08.278 --> 17:09.320
Yes.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.531
But since you're
so good at them,

17:11.614 --> 17:13.324
you can just make
another one.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.275
-But I can't sell it!
-What?!

19:52.359 --> 19:55.278
No! People want simple songs
with simple hooks.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.488

19:56.571 --> 19:58.448

Wait, wait, wait!

20:03.411 --> 20:04.621
That's-- that's
what it was before.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.872
We can go back!

20:05.955 --> 20:07.123
Nah, I'm over it.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.293
Tell you what
I do like, though,

20:10.377 --> 20:11.378
this painting.

20:11.461 --> 20:12.629
-Oh, come on!
-Tight.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.299
I love how it's
about everything,

20:16.383 --> 20:18.635
and yet, about nothing!

20:20.345 --> 20:21.471
Is it for sale?

20:21.638 --> 20:22.639
I'll give you 50 large.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.474
Fifty bucks?!

20:24.557 --> 20:25.558
Sweet!

20:26.726 --> 20:27.644
Yeah.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.646
That is definitely
what I meant.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.481
Not $50,000.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.735
I know what I'm getting Rhianna
for her yacht-warming party.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.570
What is this?!

20:41.950 --> 20:43.368
You were so beautiful!

20:43.451 --> 20:44.661
I completed you,

20:44.744 --> 20:46.538
but you completed me!

20:46.621 --> 20:47.622
[grunts]

20:49.416 --> 20:51.626
I can't believe Grandma would lose it like
that on poor, little Willow.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.336
We can't let that little girl

20:53.420 --> 20:55.380
take the punishment
for us, can we?

20:56.506 --> 20:58.675
I'm genuinely asking.
Can we?

20:59.676 --> 21:01.428
-No!
-I totally agree.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.557
-Um, hey, Grandma?
-[shouts] What?!

21:05.640 --> 21:07.392
[quickly] Frankie needs to
tell you something!

21:08.768 --> 21:10.311
Well, what is it?

21:10.395 --> 21:13.356
Uh, well...

21:13.440 --> 21:16.359
we, meaning me and she...

21:16.443 --> 21:17.569
We were the ones
who broke your puzzle.

21:17.652 --> 21:18.695
Not Willow. We're sorry.
Bye!

21:20.488 --> 21:21.823
Get back here.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.910
What you did
was cowardly.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.579
We know. We just thought we could
get out of the room

21:27.662 --> 21:30.373
before you started
screaming at us.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.583
Not that!

21:31.666 --> 21:34.002
Setting Willow up
to take the blame for you?

21:34.085 --> 21:35.462
Yeah, we feel awful.

21:35.545 --> 21:36.629
You know this means
I can't give you

21:36.713 --> 21:38.340
the tickets to
the concert, right?

21:38.423 --> 21:40.633
-We know.
-And since you're not going,

21:40.717 --> 21:43.136
I'm gonna go,
and I'm taking a friend.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.387
[scoffs]
You have a friend?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.557
I mean, which one of your many friends
will be joining you?

21:48.808 --> 21:49.768
Me.

21:49.851 --> 21:50.769
[both]
What?

21:50.852 --> 21:52.562
That's right.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.564
I heard your little plan.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.524
We can ask Willow...

21:56.608 --> 21:58.276
To talk to Grandma...

21:58.360 --> 22:00.570
And take the heat for this.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.447
Just one last time,
and then we'll never ask her

22:02.530 --> 22:03.698
to do anything for us
ever again.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.625
Aw! You were in the foam pit?

22:13.708 --> 22:14.834
That must've
been so adorable!

22:14.918 --> 22:17.754
Did you pop your head out
like a cute, little gopher?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.548
-Paige!
-Oh, right.

22:20.632 --> 22:21.758
[whispers]
Show me later.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.428
And since you can't
go to the concert,

22:25.512 --> 22:26.554
you have time
to do all the things

22:26.721 --> 22:28.431
you promised
Willow you'd do.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.850
Like start a water
conservation plan,

22:30.934 --> 22:33.520
organize a house
recycling program,

22:33.603 --> 22:34.854
plant trees,

22:34.938 --> 22:37.524
and don't forget the excrement!

22:38.608 --> 22:39.776
That still means "poop."

22:39.859 --> 22:40.860
[both]
We know.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.864
Ready to get our
jam on, Aunt Marla?

22:44.948 --> 22:46.241
You know it, girlfriend!

22:46.324 --> 22:49.536
Let's go rock out to DJ Stupid Name
or whatever.

22:51.871 --> 22:52.706
[groans]

22:52.956 --> 22:54.749
I don't wanna do this.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.669
Maybe we don't have to.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.005
What if we ask Willow--

23:00.088 --> 23:01.631
You have a problem.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.259
I do.
