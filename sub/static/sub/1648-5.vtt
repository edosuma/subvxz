00:03.420 --> 00:04.910
- ( walkie-talkie squawks )
- Rick: Morgan,

00:05.964 --> 00:08.000
I don't know if you're out there.

00:08.174 --> 00:10.130
I don't know
if you can hear me.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.508
Maybe you're listening right now.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.044
I hope so.

00:14.222 --> 00:16.884
I found others-- my family,

00:17.058 --> 00:18.514
if you can believe it.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.516
( static )

00:20.687 --> 00:22.678
My wife and son,

00:22.856 --> 00:24.517
they're alive.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.023
I wanted you to know that.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.607
There's something else
you need to know.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.521
Atlanta isn't what we thought.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.066
It's not what they promised.
The city is--

00:37.746 --> 00:40.704
do not enter the city.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.365
It belongs to the dead now.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.837
We're camped
a few miles northwest,

00:50.008 --> 00:52.044
up by a big abandoned
rock quarry.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.755
You can see it on a map.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.471
I hope you come find us.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.723
But be careful.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.640
Last night walkers
came out of the woods.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.064
We lost people.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.399
Watch yourself, Morgan.
Take care of your boy.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.405
I'll try you again
tomorrow at dawn.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.784
( static )

01:34.636 --> 01:36.376
Andrea.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.343
I'm so sorry.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.684
She's gone.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.816
You got to let us take her.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.116
We all cared about her

02:00.286 --> 02:03.449
and I promise
we'll be as gentle as we can.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.923
(grunts)

02:32.777 --> 02:35.063
(coughing)

02:41.327 --> 02:43.534
She still won't move?

02:43.705 --> 02:46.071
Lori:
Won't even talk to us.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.619
She's been there all night.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.750
What do we do?

02:51.921 --> 02:54.833
Can't just leave Amy like that.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.999
We need to deal with it

02:57.177 --> 02:59.088
same as the others.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.511
I'll tell her how it is.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.600
- Andrea.
- ( cocks )

03:09.689 --> 03:11.771
I know how the safety works.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.738
All right. Okay.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.022
I'm sorry.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.285
Daryl:
Y'all can't be serious.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.328
Let that girl hamstring us?

04:17.507 --> 04:18.963
The dead girl's a time bomb.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.294
Rick:
What do you suggest?

04:23.012 --> 04:24.422
Take the shot.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.929
Clean, in the brain from here.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.591
Hell, I can hit a turkey between
the eyes from this distance.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.761
No. For God's sakes, let her be.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.611
( scoffs )

04:46.452 --> 04:49.159
Wake up, Jimbo.
We've got some work to do.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.826
( panting )

04:53.001 --> 04:55.287
Morales: Thanks.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.292
- Thanks.
- What are you guys doing?

04:57.463 --> 05:00.125
This is for geeks.
Our people go over there.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.086
Daryl: What's the difference?
They're all infected.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.627
Glenn: Our people go
in that row over there.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.296
We don't burn them!

05:08.474 --> 05:10.635
We bury them.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.261
Understand?

05:17.442 --> 05:20.650
Our people go
in that row over there.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.986
You reap what you sow.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.152
Morales:
You know what? Shut up, man.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.321
Y'all left my brother for dead.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.994
You had this coming.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.468
Are you bleeding?

05:47.638 --> 05:50.846
ljust got some on me
from the bodies.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.178
That blood is fresh.
Were you bit?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.513
Jim: No.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.552
I got scratched during the attack.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.221
- You got bit.
- I'm fine.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.014
Then show me.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.605
- ( whispers ) Don't tell, please.
- A walker got him.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.865
A walker bit Jim.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.703
- Jim: I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Show it to us.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.616
- Show it to us.
- ( chattering )

06:17.794 --> 06:19.204
- Shane: Easy, Jim.
- Daryl: Grab him.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.586
Jim, put it down. Put it down.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.997
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.882
I'm okay. I'm okay.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.009
I'm okay.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.843
I'm okay. I'm okay.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.973
I'm okay.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.396
I'm okay.
( breathing heavily )

06:41.275 --> 06:42.936
I'm okay.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.400
I say we put
a pickaxe in his head

06:51.577 --> 06:52.862
and the dead girl's
and be done with it.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.902
Is that what you'd want
if it were you?

06:55.081 --> 06:57.197
Yeah, and I'd thank you
while you did it.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.240
I hate to say it--
I never thought I would--

06:59.419 --> 07:00.875
but maybe Daryl's right.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.878
Jim's not a monster, Dale,
or some rabid dog.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.209
- I'm not suggesting--
- He's sick. A sick man.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.215
We start down that road,
where do we draw the line?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.753
The line's pretty clear.
Zero tolerance for walkers,

07:11.931 --> 07:14.297
- or them to be.
- What if we can get him help?

07:14.475 --> 07:16.466
I heard the CDC
was working on a cure.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.602
I heard that too. Heard a lot of things
before the world went to hell.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.728
What if the CDC is
still up and running?

07:21.899 --> 07:23.810
- Man, that is a stretch right there.
- Rick: Why?

07:23.985 --> 07:27.773
If there's any government left,
any structure at all,

07:27.947 --> 07:29.938
they'd protect the CDC
at all costs, wouldn't they?

07:30.116 --> 07:32.653
I think it's our best shot.
Shelter, protection--

07:32.827 --> 07:35.739
Okay, Rick, you want those things,
all right? I do too, okay?

07:35.913 --> 07:39.997
Now if they exist, they're at
the army base. Fort Benning.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.283
That's 100 miles
in the opposite direction.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.372
That is right.
But it's away from the hot zone.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.286
Now listen to me.
If that place is operational,

07:45.465 --> 07:48.502
it'll be heavily armed.
We'd be safe there.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.792
Rick: The military were
on the front lines of this thing.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.052
They got overrun.
We've all seen that.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.305
The CDC is our best choice
and Jim's only chance.

07:58.936 --> 08:01.678
You go looking for aspirin,
do what you need to do.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.596
Someone needs to have
some balls to take care

08:03.774 --> 08:05.230
- of this damn problem!
- Hey hey hey!

08:05.401 --> 08:07.312
We don't kill the living.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.781
That's funny coming from a man
who just put a gun to my head.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.283
We may disagree
on some things,

08:16.454 --> 08:19.070
not on this.
You put it down.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.658
Go on.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.877
- Come with me.
- Where are you taking me?

08:27.048 --> 08:29.130
Somewhere safe.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.220
I came to pay my respects.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.653
Did I ever mention

09:00.831 --> 09:03.743
how I lost my wife?

09:07.505 --> 09:09.712
- Cancer, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.503
I dragged her to every doctor,

09:13.678 --> 09:15.885
every test.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.427
And after all the surgeries
and the chemos,

09:20.601 --> 09:23.217
she was ready.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.853
She accepted it, you know?

09:27.984 --> 09:30.566
But I never could.

09:30.736 --> 09:34.354
And I spent the last few years

09:34.532 --> 09:37.069
so angry.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.859
I felt so cheated.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.453
Since she passed,

09:46.627 --> 09:50.290
you girls were the first people...

09:52.174 --> 09:54.085
that I cared anything for.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.444
This is her birthday?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.779
Her birthday was always like--

10:20.953 --> 10:23.740
like a week long affair.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.156
But I somehow always missed it.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.291
l was away at college

10:29.462 --> 10:31.999
or too busy for kid's parties.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.586
She'd call all excited.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.127
| always said that I'd make it home

10:39.305 --> 10:42.297
and I really always meant to,

10:42.475 --> 10:46.764
but I never made it
past that phone call.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.974
I know things
are hard enough for you

10:50.149 --> 10:53.186
without adding guilt
into the mix, huh?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.355
( head squishes )

11:37.321 --> 11:41.030
I'll do it. He's my husband.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.191
(crying)

12:04.140 --> 12:06.597
( groans )

12:12.523 --> 12:15.139
(grunting)

12:26.245 --> 12:28.782
(sobbing )

12:45.765 --> 12:47.756
(shallow breathing )

12:55.941 --> 12:58.023
( breathing )

13:47.993 --> 13:50.575
Amy.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.329
Amy, I'm sorry.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.130
I'm sorry

14:07.304 --> 14:09.920
for not ever being there.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.680
| always thought
there'd be more time.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.353
(growling)

14:36.750 --> 14:38.877
I'm here now, Amy.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.626
I'm here.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.926
I love you.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.087
(gunshot)

15:14.413 --> 15:16.654
Say it.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.742
Okay.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.003
I'm thinking
if you'd have stayed here,

15:25.174 --> 15:27.631
if you'd have looked
after your own--

15:27.801 --> 15:31.419
instead you went off.
You took half our manpower with you.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.430
I'm thinking maybe our losses
wouldn't have been so bad.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.932
If we hadn't gone off
and brought those guns back

15:37.102 --> 15:39.889
when we did, I think our losses
would have been a lot worse.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.271
- Maybe the entire camp.
- ( truck approaching )

15:42.441 --> 15:44.352
( exhales )

15:56.622 --> 15:59.489
I still think it's a mistake
not burning these bodies.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.703
It's what we said we'd do, right?

16:01.877 --> 16:04.664
Burn 'em all, wasn't that the idea?

16:04.838 --> 16:06.089
Shane:
At first.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.792
The Chinaman gets
all emotional,

16:07.967 --> 16:10.925
says it's not the thing to do,
we just follow him along?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.513
These people need to know
who the hell's in charge here,

16:15.683 --> 16:18.470
- what the rules are.
- There are no rules.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.635
Lori:
Well, that's a problem.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.896
We haven't had one minute
to hold onto anything of our old selves.

16:24.066 --> 16:28.309
We need time to mourn
and we need to bury our dead.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.398
It's what people do.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.983
Oh no.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.367
No no no no.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.575
No, not this, please.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.665
( groans )

16:47.840 --> 16:50.172
- ( panting )
- ( zombies growling)

16:53.345 --> 16:55.586
No no no.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.221
Oh, no no no.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.350
- No no.
-( people scream )

17:03.147 --> 17:05.433
( panting )

17:10.821 --> 17:12.857
(crying )
I can do it. I can do it.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.648
I can do it!
I can do it.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.294
(crying)

17:43.896 --> 17:45.807
Dale: Hey.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.516
( panting )

17:57.993 --> 18:00.029
Burying other people
is bad enough,

18:00.204 --> 18:02.240
- but the thought of one of us--
-Loﬁ:Shh.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.030
Are we safe now, Dad?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.746
Now that we're together?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.876
I won't leave again.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.083
I promise you that.
Not for anything.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.585
Now give me a chance

18:17.763 --> 18:19.549
to discuss some things
with your mom, okay?

18:19.723 --> 18:21.588
- Yeah.
- Rick: All right.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.507
All right.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.355
Shane blames me for not being here.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.315
Do you?

18:41.078 --> 18:44.366
We got guns now.
We're stronger.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.280
And we have fewer people.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.835
That makes us weaker.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.084
You want me to say
I think you were right?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.337
I understand that.

18:56.385 --> 19:00.298
All I can say is that neither
one of you is entirely wrong.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.305
It's the best I can do right now.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.102
What about the CDC?

19:10.649 --> 19:12.890
- Rick--
- We're at the ragged edge here.

19:13.068 --> 19:16.026
We need relief and we got
a sick man who needs help.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.902
I don't know
why people can't see that.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.859
Well, look at their faces.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.615
Look at mine.
We're all terrified.

19:22.786 --> 19:26.153
If one of us suggested,
based on a hunch,

19:26.331 --> 19:28.367
that we head toward that city,

19:28.542 --> 19:30.453
you'd have no part of it.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.378
Tell me something with certainty.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.344
I love you.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.024
That's-- that's all--
that's all I got.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.776
I love you too.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.526
( door opens)

20:05.704 --> 20:07.695
( knocks )

20:10.167 --> 20:12.658
His fever is worse.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.997
You need anything?

20:15.172 --> 20:16.628
Uh...

20:16.798 --> 20:19.710
water.
Could use more water.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.170
- Lori: I'll get some.
- Okay.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.711
Lori:
Carol, you help me?

20:36.026 --> 20:38.142
You save a grave for me?

20:40.656 --> 20:42.237
Nobody wants that.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.069
Jim:
It's not about what you want.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.654
That, uh-- that sound you hear,

20:50.832 --> 20:53.824
that's God laughing
while you make plans.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.091
What I want, Jim, if--

21:04.137 --> 21:05.923
if God allows,

21:06.098 --> 21:08.680
is to get you some help.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.386
( groans )

21:10.560 --> 21:12.687
(coughing)

21:15.774 --> 21:18.231
(spits)

21:28.787 --> 21:31.369
( groans, inhales deeply )

21:31.540 --> 21:34.407
(coughs)

21:38.630 --> 21:40.541
Watch the mangroves.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.799
Their roots will gouge
the whole boat.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.510
You know that, right?

21:47.681 --> 21:51.765
Amy is there swimming.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.183
You'll watch the boat, right?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.473
You said you would.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.731
I'll watch the boat.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.066
Don't worry.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.902
Okay.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.707
I need you to help talk
some sense into Rick.

22:29.014 --> 22:32.006
Look, this CDC thing,
Lori, it's a mistake.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.012
So you're backing him?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.098
What else would I do?
He's my husband.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.638
Look, it may be time
for you to play the dutiful wife,

22:39.816 --> 22:41.431
but you can't tell me
that fixing your marriage

22:41.610 --> 22:43.350
is worth putting
people's lives at risk.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.859
I think folks around here
can make up their minds

22:45.030 --> 22:47.146
without bringing my marriage into it.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.315
It's a habit you need to break.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.200
I guess I'll just add it to the list

22:52.371 --> 22:53.986
of habits that I'm breaking

22:54.164 --> 22:55.654
whether I like it or not.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.120
What habits?

23:01.463 --> 23:04.205
Just talking about
my need for a plan, man.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.465
So what is it?
Are we leaving or not?

23:07.636 --> 23:09.672
Maybe y'all just want to stay here.

23:09.846 --> 23:12.007
We could hang some more tin cans.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.638
We can't stay here.
We both know that.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.892
lwasjust telling Shane I think
we should trust your gut.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.236
Let's go do our sweep.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.831
Shane:
Tell you what, man,

23:40.001 --> 23:42.208
these people, man,
they're not convinced.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.789
You know?

23:43.964 --> 23:46.046
You head to the CDC,

23:46.216 --> 23:48.207
you might be on your own.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.751
You gotta really consider
whether you want

23:50.929 --> 23:52.885
to put Lori and Car!
in that kind of spot.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.547
I got to do
what's best for my family.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.807
Best for your family?
What's that?

23:57.978 --> 24:01.095
- Exposing them to all kinds of risks?
- As opposed to what?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.889
Crossing 100 miles
of hostile territory?

24:04.067 --> 24:07.559
If we're looking for a lifeline,
I say swim toward the closest ship,

24:07.737 --> 24:10.023
not further out to sea.

24:10.198 --> 24:11.938
Why can't you back me up?

24:12.117 --> 24:14.699
Shane:
Look, lwant to. lt'sjust...

24:14.870 --> 24:17.577
I don't see it.

24:17.747 --> 24:20.124
If it was your family,
you'd feel differently.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.712
What did you say to me?

24:29.801 --> 24:32.042
I kept 'em safe, man.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.462
I looked after them like they were--
no, they were my own.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.631
- That's what I did, Rick.
- Shane, I didn't mean it that way.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.845
Well, how'd you mean it?

24:40.020 --> 24:41.476
Go on, man. How'd you mean it?

24:41.646 --> 24:44.638
( sighs )
You're misinterpreting me, man.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.431
- All right.
- You're just hearing it wrong.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.851
- Yeah?
- Look, you know--

24:49.029 --> 24:52.738
you know I can never
repay that debt, okay?

24:52.908 --> 24:55.570
( branch snaps)

25:38.870 --> 25:40.986
Jesus.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.160
( chuckles )

25:47.087 --> 25:49.328
I know.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.003
Gonna have to start wearing
reflective vests out here.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.053
Seriously.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.387
Come on, man.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.061
Come on, man, let's go.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.223
Nothing out here.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.293
Shane:
l've, uh--

26:27.460 --> 26:29.792
I've been thinking
about Rick's plan.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.749
Now look, there are no--

26:31.923 --> 26:34.300
there are no guarantees
either way.

26:34.467 --> 26:37.129
I'll be the first one to admit that.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.545
I've known this man a long time.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.552
I trust his instincts.

26:45.312 --> 26:49.146
I say the most important thing here
is we need to stay together.

26:52.027 --> 26:56.111
So those of you that agree,

26:56.281 --> 26:58.021
we leave first thing
in the morning.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.900
Okay?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.450
- ( walkie-talkie squawks )
- We're moving out,

27:09.628 --> 27:12.290
leaving the quarry.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.955
If you heard me yesterday,
you may be coming here.

27:15.133 --> 27:18.967
If you are, we'll be gone
by the time you arrive.

27:20.513 --> 27:23.425
I'm leaving a note
and map behind for you

27:23.600 --> 27:25.306
taped to a red car

27:25.477 --> 27:27.763
so you can follow our trail.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.892
We're heading to the CDC.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.022
If there's anything left,
it's got to be there,

27:33.193 --> 27:34.979
don't you think?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.399
Morgan...

27:40.033 --> 27:42.149
I hope you were right
about that place.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.410
I need you to be.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.164
( gasps )

27:50.335 --> 27:52.747
( muffled talking )

27:55.006 --> 27:57.213
(coughs)

27:57.384 --> 27:59.124
Shane:
Everybody listen up.

27:59.302 --> 28:02.089
Those of you with CBs,
we're gonna be on channel 40.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.003
Let's keep the chatter down, okay?

28:04.182 --> 28:07.140
Now you got a problem,
don't have a CB,

28:07.310 --> 28:09.471
can't get a signal or anything at all,
you're gonna hit your horn one time.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.432
That'll stop the caravan.

28:11.606 --> 28:14.473
- Any questions?
- Morales: We're, uh--

28:14.651 --> 28:17.108
we're not going.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.981
Woman:
We have family in Birmingham.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.149
We want to be
with our people.

28:24.327 --> 28:26.363
You go on your own, you won't
have anyone to watch your back.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.403
Morales:
We'll take the chance.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.867
I got to do what's best
for my family.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.125
- You sure?
- Morales: We talked about it.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.627
We're sure.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.379
All right.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.290
- Shane.
- Yeah, all right.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.584
- Shane: .357?
- Rick: Yeah.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.515
The box is half full.

28:53.064 --> 28:56.272
Thank you all... for everything.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.354
- Lori: Come here.
- ( crying )

28:58.528 --> 29:00.143
Shane:
Good luck, man.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.403
- Morales: Appreciate it.
- Shane: Yeah.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.566
- Bye.
- ( Sophia crying)

29:05.744 --> 29:07.735
Woman:
Thank you.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.073
Bye.

29:11.791 --> 29:14.168
Channel 40
if you change your minds.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.041
- All right?
- Yeah.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.328
Carol: I know.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.917
What makes you think
our odds are any better?

29:25.138 --> 29:27.174
Come on. Let's go.

29:27.348 --> 29:30.215
- Let's move out.
- ( engines start)

30:52.183 --> 30:54.469
(groaning)

31:00.859 --> 31:02.599
(hissing)

31:02.777 --> 31:04.768
I told you we'd never
get far on that hose.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.528
I said I needed the one
from the cube van.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.690
Can you jury-rig it?

31:09.868 --> 31:11.699
That's all it's been so far.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.111
It's more duct tape than hose.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.496
And I'm out of duct tape.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.543
Shane:
| see something up ahead.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.544
A gas station if we're lucky.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.046
Y'all, Jim--

31:25.216 --> 31:27.958
it's bad. I don't think
he can take anymore.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.465
Hey, Rick, you want
to hold down the fort?

31:31.639 --> 31:33.345
l'll drive ahead,
see what I can bring back.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.757
T-Dog: Yeah, I'll come along too
and I'll back you up.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.436
Shane:
Y'all keep your eyes open now.

31:37.604 --> 31:39.185
We'll be right back.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.599
(jeep door opens, closes )

31:44.777 --> 31:46.904
( engine starts, revs )

31:47.071 --> 31:48.481
We'll be back on the road soon.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.908
Jim:
Oh no. Christ.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.361
My bones--

31:53.536 --> 31:54.946
my bones are like glass.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.452
Every little bump--

31:56.623 --> 31:59.490
God, this ride is killing me.

31:59.667 --> 32:02.158
Leave me here.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.917
I'm done.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.339
Just leave me.

32:11.512 --> 32:14.254
I want to be with my family.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.430
They're all dead.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.563
I don't think you know
what you're asking.

32:24.734 --> 32:28.067
The fever-- you've been delirious
more often than not.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.102
I know.
Don't you think I know?

32:31.282 --> 32:32.943
( groans )

32:35.119 --> 32:37.496
l'm clear now.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.076
In five minutes I may not be.

32:40.249 --> 32:43.491
Rick, I know what I'm asking.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.410
I want this.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.625
Now that's on me.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.714
Okay?

32:53.888 --> 32:55.924
My decision.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.636
Not your failure.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.934
It's what he says he wants.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.691
And he's lucid?

33:08.861 --> 33:10.647
He seems to be.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.029
I would say yes.

33:13.199 --> 33:16.532
Dale: Back in the camp
when I said Daryl might be right

33:16.703 --> 33:18.659
and you shut me down,

33:18.830 --> 33:20.991
you misunderstood.

33:21.165 --> 33:24.248
I would never go along

33:24.419 --> 33:27.081
with callously killing a man.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.496
lwasjust gonna suggest

33:29.674 --> 33:33.633
that we ask Jim what he wants.

33:35.722 --> 33:38.008
And I think we have an answer.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.466
Shane:
We just leave him here?

33:41.644 --> 33:43.635
We take off?

33:43.813 --> 33:46.350
Man, I'm not sure
I could live with that.

33:46.524 --> 33:47.809
Lori:
It's not your call,

33:47.984 --> 33:50.191
either one of you.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.859
- Rick: Yeah. That's it.
- ( Jim groans)

33:56.034 --> 33:58.525
( breathing heavily )

34:01.205 --> 34:04.288
Hey, another damn tree.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.199
( chuckles )

34:07.253 --> 34:08.959
Hey, Jim--

34:09.130 --> 34:11.337
I mean, you know
it doesn't need to be this.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.668
No.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.584
It's good.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.799
The breeze feels nice.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.884
Okay.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.390
All right.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.017
Just close your eyes, sweetie.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.901
Don't fight.

34:47.043 --> 34:50.251
Jim, do you want this?

34:51.547 --> 34:52.923
Jim: No.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.132
You'll need it.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.469
I'm okay.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.640
I'm okay.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.816
Oh. Hey.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.438
Thanks for, uh--

35:15.613 --> 35:16.853
for fighting for us.

35:17.031 --> 35:19.738
Okay.
( breathing loudly)

36:07.456 --> 36:09.868
( cars starting )

36:31.647 --> 36:33.683
( beeping )

36:35.860 --> 36:38.442
Jenner here.

36:38.613 --> 36:42.026
lt's day 194
since Wildfire was declared

36:42.200 --> 36:45.408
and 63 days since the disease
abruptly went global.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.365
There's no clinical progress to report.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.034
ltem-- I finally got the scrubbers

36:55.213 --> 36:56.544
in the east sector
shut down to save power.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.999
Wish I could have
done it a month ago,

36:58.174 --> 36:59.539
but it took me that long
to figure it out.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.127
Too bad I never studied
engineering.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.712
Could have saved
a lot of amps.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.879
ltem-- I'm still not sleeping well.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.719
Can't seem
to keep regular hours.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.054
Living underground doesn't help,

37:11.229 --> 37:13.220
not knowing if it's day or night.

37:13.397 --> 37:17.982
I'm just feeling
very off-kilter these days.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.404
( beeping )

37:25.243 --> 37:26.574
-( beeps)
- ( door hisses)

37:26.744 --> 37:28.860
( classical score playing )

37:38.422 --> 37:40.208
( beeps )

38:02.655 --> 38:06.398
( computer beeps )

38:25.553 --> 38:27.509
(alarm blaring )

38:29.807 --> 38:31.468
Computer voice:
Alert status.

38:31.642 --> 38:34.304
Air qualifiers indicate
corrosive fumes.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.730
All personnel
must clear the room.

38:36.897 --> 38:40.389
Corrosive element is
deemed poisonous if inhaled.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.948
All personnel clear.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.335
- Full decontamination in effect.
- No!

39:12.391 --> 39:15.133
Full decontamination complete.

39:20.649 --> 39:23.391
The TS-19 samples are gone.

39:23.569 --> 39:26.777
The tragedy of their loss
cannot be overstated.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.691
They were
our freshest samples by far.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.946
None of the other samples
we gathered even came close.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.457
Those are necrotic,

39:39.627 --> 39:42.539
useless dead flesh.

39:47.593 --> 39:50.005
I don't even know
why I'm talking to you.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.926
I bet there isn't
a single son of a bitch

39:55.101 --> 39:57.342
out there still listening, is there?

40:00.981 --> 40:03.188
Is there?

40:06.070 --> 40:07.731
Fine.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.521
Saves me the embarrassment.

40:16.789 --> 40:19.280
I think tomorrow
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.917
I haven't decided.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.372
But tonight,

40:28.551 --> 40:30.758
I'm getting drunk.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.762
(pouring drink)

40:39.353 --> 40:41.139
Speaking of which,

40:41.313 --> 40:43.770
how far do you think
I can chuck this, huh?

40:45.276 --> 40:46.857
Pretty far I bet.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.283
- ( glass shatters )
- Oh!

40:53.451 --> 40:55.612
It is out of the stadium!

41:02.668 --> 41:04.784
(flies buzzing )

41:25.691 --> 41:27.977
(people coughing)

41:28.152 --> 41:29.517
(cocks gun)

41:29.695 --> 41:32.983
( Shane whispering ) All right,
everybody. Keep moving. Go on.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.864
Stay quiet. Let's go.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.543
- ( chattering )
- Rick: Keep moving. Stay together.

41:56.722 --> 41:59.509
- Keep moving. Come on.
- Shane: Shh.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.393
- Lori: Carol.
- Rick: Shh.

42:04.563 --> 42:06.269
Glenn: Oh, God.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.692
(alarm beeping )

42:28.379 --> 42:30.995
No.

42:31.173 --> 42:33.255
Rick:
Keep it together. Come on.

42:33.425 --> 42:35.416
Lori:
We're almost there, baby.

42:35.594 --> 42:37.050
Almost there.

42:40.307 --> 42:42.218
- ( rattles)
- Shane: Nothing?

42:45.563 --> 42:47.599
(pounds on door)

42:47.773 --> 42:49.729
T-Dog:
There's nobody here.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.982
Then why are
these shutters down?

42:52.152 --> 42:53.562
- Daryl: Walkers!
- Lori: Baby, come on.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.023
- ( guns cock)
- ( child whimpering)

42:58.242 --> 43:00.073
Daryl:
You led us into a graveyard!

43:00.244 --> 43:02.405
- Dale: He made a call.
- Daryl: It was the wrong damn call!

43:02.580 --> 43:04.992
Just shut up. You hear me?
Shutup.Shutup!

43:07.251 --> 43:09.207
Shane:
Do you hear me? No blame.

43:09.378 --> 43:11.414
She's right. We can't be here,
this close to the city after dark.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.588
Fort Benning, Rick--
still an option.

43:15.759 --> 43:18.501
Andrea: On what?
No food, no fuel. That's 100 miles.

43:18.679 --> 43:20.260
- 125. I checked the map.
- Lori: Forget Fort Benning.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.467
We need answers tonight, now.

43:22.641 --> 43:24.597
- Well, think of something.
- Glenn: Come on, let's go.

43:24.768 --> 43:27.851
- T-Dog: Let's get out of here.
- Glenn: Let's go. Please.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.479
- ( whirrs )
- Shane: All right, back to the cars.

43:30.649 --> 43:32.856
- Let's go. Move.
- The camera-- it moved.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.519
- You imagined it.
- It moved.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.313
- It moved.
- Rick, it is dead, man.

43:39.491 --> 43:42.619
It's an automated device.
lt's gears, okay?

43:42.786 --> 43:44.287
They'rejust winding down.
Now come on.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.787
- No, just go away.
- Shane: Man, just listen to me.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.868
Look around this place.
It's dead, okay?

43:49.043 --> 43:51.455
It's dead.
You need to let it go, Rick.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.290
Lori:
Rick, there's nobody here!

43:53.464 --> 43:56.331
I know you're in there.
I know you can hear me.

43:56.508 --> 43:59.295
- Shane: Get back to the cars now!
- Rick: Please, we're desperate.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.631
Please help us.
We have women, children,

44:01.805 --> 44:03.796
- no food, hardly any gas left.
- Rick.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.475
- There's nobody here.
- We have nowhere else to go.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.634
-( pounds on door)
- Shane: Keep your eyes open.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.473
If you don't let us in,
you're killing us!

44:10.648 --> 44:13.435
- Please!
- Shane: Come on, buddy, let's go.

44:13.609 --> 44:14.974
- Let's go.
- Rick: Please help us.

44:15.152 --> 44:16.983
( people shouting )

44:17.154 --> 44:20.237
You're killing us! You're killing us!

44:20.407 --> 44:22.523
You're killing us!

44:25.120 --> 44:27.202
( clangs )

44:27.373 --> 44:29.364
(gas hissing )

44:37.841 --> 44:41.049
(theme music playing )
