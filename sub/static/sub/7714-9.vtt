Once a year, Dwight holds
a seminar updating us

00:12.429 --> 00:14.847
on the newest developments
in the world of karate.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.473
Because,
as we all know,

00:16.558 --> 00:19.309
the one thing
that thousand-year-old
martial arts do all the time

00:19.394 --> 00:20.644
is change.

00:20.812 --> 00:24.773
How can l pose
this to you in
a relatable way?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.693
You are all members
of the Yakuza,

00:27.777 --> 00:30.696
and you happen to be
visiting the Lackawanna
Trolley Museum,

00:30.780 --> 00:33.365
and you are attacked
by Triads.

00:33.450 --> 00:37.077
How can you hold them off
until your clan arrives?

00:37.162 --> 00:39.913
You cannot go wrong
with a throat punch.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.373
(YELLS)

00:41.458 --> 00:43.709
Okay, so there's
no defense for that.
Good to know.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.587
No, there is
a defense for that.
Let me demonstrate.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.255
Someone attack me.
Kevin, go!

00:48.339 --> 00:49.631
No way.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.842
Last time, you pulled
my pants down,

00:51.926 --> 00:54.261
and then you
tried to choke me
with my shoelace.

00:54.345 --> 00:58.057
False. l did choke you
with your shoelace.
Now come at me!

00:58.141 --> 00:59.808
Okay, with all due respect
to everyone here,

00:59.893 --> 01:03.562
l think the most
worthy opponent
of you is you.

01:03.646 --> 01:06.732
That is correct,
unless there happen
to be measles present.

01:06.816 --> 01:10.402
So let's just say that
Dwight has come at you
with the throat punch.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.863
Now, how would you, Dwight,
defend against it?

01:12.947 --> 01:14.907
Easy. Allow me
to demonstrate.

01:14.991 --> 01:18.410
l am attacking myself
with a throat punch.
Here it comes.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.622
Block. Grasp wrist as such.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.790
And what if
he comes at you
with the other hand?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.208
Because he does have two.

01:24.459 --> 01:28.253
Good point.
Second throat punch.
Absorb the blow.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.200
The important thing
to remember, Jim,

01:58.284 --> 02:02.454
we always have
what is called the

my favorite art form

You'll have to be

Bankruptcy could
mean a lot of things.

just restructuring
