WHICH, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

03:06.970 --> 03:08.244

OR THEY'RE GONNA
CANCEL OUR COVERAGE.

07:18.990 --> 07:21.367
- WE DON'T NEED
AN ALARM SYSTEM, CAMILLE.

07:21.470 --> 07:22.778
THE PLACE IS
LIKE A FORTRESS HERE.

07:22.890 --> 07:25.085
- THEY'RE GETTING
VERY SERIOUS NOW.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.292
OUR POLICY EXPIRES
AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

07:26.410 --> 07:28.230
- YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.
WE'LL CALL SOMEBODY.

07:28.340 --> 07:30.615
SET UP AN APPOINTMENT.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.609
I THINK THE WHOLE THING'S
RIDICULOUS, ANYWAY.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.233
- HOUSE IS FALLING APART.
THAT'S WHAT'S RIDICULOUS.

07:35.350 --> 07:38.342
- OOH, I HEARD THAT.
THE HOUSE IS NOT FALLING APART.

07:38.450 --> 07:39.269

REMEMBER, TELL YOUR MOM.

07:45.530 --> 07:46.690

VERY SUSTAINABLE.

07:46.810 --> 07:48.732

THE GOOD WATER BOTTLE.

07:49.950 --> 07:50.837
YOU TOLD YOUR MOM.

MADE OF CARDBOARD.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.449
AND THIS
PLASTICKY-FOILY STUFF,

08:11.560 --> 08:13.175
THAT'S WHAT
CLOGS UP OUR LANDFILLS.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.033
YOU REALIZE IT'S NOT
VERY GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

08:16.150 --> 08:18.072
- BUT I LIKE POTATO CHIPS.

08:18.180 --> 08:19.215
- BUT, UH, YOU SEE,
IT'S NOT WHAT WE CALL

08:19.320 --> 08:20.548
VERY SUSTAINABLE.

08:20.670 --> 08:22.456
DO YOU REALIZE THAT
THE AVERAGE SCHOOL CHILD

08:22.570 --> 08:25.562
GENERATES 67 POUNDS
OF TRASH PER YEAR?

08:25.670 --> 08:27.228
THAT'S A LOT.

08:27.330 --> 08:28.399
THAT'S LIKE A WHOLE ONE
OF YOU

08:28.500 --> 08:29.296
MADE OUT OF GARBAGE.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.528

08:32.650 --> 08:34.368
JUST GIVE THIS TO
YOUR MOM AND DAD, OKAY?

08:34.470 --> 08:36.950
ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO
IS BE MORE GREEN.

08:37.060 --> 08:37.572
THAT'S ALL WE'RE
REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.477
- GREEN IT UP, PAL.

08:39.580 --> 08:40.376
WHAT? IS THAT TOO MUCH?

08:40.480 --> 08:41.333
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO MAKE HIM CRY?

08:41.450 --> 08:43.759

12:35.400 --> 12:36.150
IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S--
I JUST AM WONDERING.

YEAH, YOU DO THAT.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.794
- HERE, LET ME
HAVE A LOOK AT IT.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.049
- BUT ANYTHING ELSE
THAT MIGHT GET...STICKY?

14:40.150 --> 14:43.017
- LIKE WHAT? I--
- I MEAN, IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.156
ARRESTS, PROSTITUTES, AFFAIRS.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.047
SEXTING, CROSS-DRESSING,
SECRET FETISH ES.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.491
- NO.
- UM, PRETTY MUCH, THOUGH,

14:49.610 --> 14:50.531
ANYTHING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT,
YOU GOTTA TELL ME THIS.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.814
- THERE IS NOTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.505
- OKAY, GOOD.

14:58.620 --> 14:59.951
- I MEAN, WHEN YOU SAY THAT
THERE'S ANYTHING

15:00.070 --> 15:02.538
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, EXACTLY?

15:02.660 --> 15:04.548
- JUST TELL ME.
IT'S OKAY.

15:04.660 --> 15:05.547
- OKAY.

15:05.660 --> 15:07.821
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,
I HAD AN ASSISTANT.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.202
WORKED HERE.
SHE KISSED ME.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.526
- OKAY.
- NOTHING HAPPENED BEYOND THAT.

15:10.630 --> 15:11.858
- IT WAS JUST A KISS?
- AND I DIDN'T KISS HER.

15:11.980 --> 15:14.175
SHE KISSED ME.
- OH, SH--UH, YEAH.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.552
- WHAT?
- DON'T THEY ALWAYS?

15:15.670 --> 15:16.807
- SHE DID.
- I BELIEVE YOU.

15:16.910 --> 15:17.979
- SHE KISSED ME.

15:18.080 --> 15:18.978
- YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GET DEFENSIVE.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.352
- I TOLD KRISTINA ABOUT IT.

15:20.470 --> 15:22.779
- WOW, YOU TOLD YOUR WIFE,
AND IT WAS JUST A KISS?

15:22.880 --> 15:23.744
- ONE KISS.
- YEAH. OKAY.

15:23.850 --> 15:26.501
I WOULD NOT HAVE
ADVISED THAT.

15:26.610 --> 15:27.770
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

15:27.890 --> 15:29.118
- ALL RIGHT,
ANY REASON TO FEEL

15:29.230 --> 15:30.857
THAT THIS WOMAN MIGHT
MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT,

15:30.960 --> 15:32.188
MAKE IT A BIG DEAL?
- NO.

15:32.310 --> 15:33.789
- OKAY, WELL, I'LL NEED
HER INFORMATION ANYWAY.

15:33.890 --> 15:35.949
- WHY, YOU GONNA
TALK TO HER?

15:36.070 --> 15:38.038
- NO, BUT IN CASE SHE COMES OUT
AND SAYS ANYTHING,

15:38.140 --> 15:39.619
I CAN JUMP ON IT QUICKLY.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.799
- OKAY.
'CAUSE SHE KISSED ME.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.413
- I BELIEVE YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.385
THAT'S IT, I MEAN, THOSE ARE
ALL MY SKELETONS, I SWEAR.

15:44.490 --> 15:46.003
ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE
GOING WAY FAR BACK.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.862
YOU KNOW,
LIKE HIGH SCHOOL.

15:47.980 --> 15:48.799
- I DON'T WANNA KNOW
ABOUT IT.

15:48.910 --> 15:50.696
- ALL RIGHT.

15:50.810 --> 15:53.256
JUST SOME NAKED PHOTOGRAPHS--
WE STREAKED THROUGH

15:53.360 --> 15:54.907
A MOTHER-DAUGHTER BANQUET,
BASEBALL TEAM,

15:55.020 --> 15:56.226
HAD DISGUISES ON,
SUNGLASSES.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.638
COULDN'T PROBABLY EVEN
TELL IT WAS ME.

15:57.740 --> 15:59.844
- I'M GONNA PRETEND LIKE
I NEVER HEARD THAT.

15:59.950 --> 16:00.917
- OKAY, I'M SORRY, I'M JUST--
I'M TELLING YOU EVERYTHING

16:01.020 --> 16:03.090
THERE IS 'CAUSE YOU WANNA
KNOW THIS STUFF.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.781
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T NEED
TO KNOW THAT.

16:04.890 --> 16:06.266
YOU HAD DISGUISES ON.
- CAN WE BE DONE?

16:06.370 --> 16:07.507
- I'M SAYING THINGS--
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

16:07.620 --> 16:08.609
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR,
LIKE, TWO HOURS.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.449
IT SEEMS A LITTLE EXTREME.

16:10.550 --> 16:11.471
- OKAY, BUT TRUST ME,
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

16:11.590 --> 16:13.444
WE HAVE TO GO OVER
A FULL WORK HISTORY.

16:13.550 --> 16:15.347
YOU KNOW, I NEED TO KNOW
EVERY JOB YOU'VE HAD,

16:15.450 --> 16:17.133
SALARY,
REASONS FOR LEAVING.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.070
LET'S START WITH T&S.
HOW MUCH WERE YOU MAKING WHEN--

16:19.180 --> 16:19.862
- I'M SORRY, HEATHER,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

16:19.970 --> 16:22.040
THIS IS PRIVATE INFORMATION.

16:22.150 --> 16:23.833
NOBODY'S EVER EVEN HEARD
OF KRISTINA.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.419
SHE'S NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE.

16:25.530 --> 16:26.599
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S RUNNING
FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

16:26.700 --> 16:27.906
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY NEED
ALL THIS INFORMATION.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.419
AND, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

16:29.540 --> 16:31.462
YOU KNOW, BOB LITTLE'S
A LEGITIMATE CANDIDATE.

16:31.570 --> 16:33.879
HE'S GOT MONEY, HIS NAME
IS IN YARDS ALL OVER BERKELEY.

16:33.990 --> 16:36.879
KRISTINA, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S, UH...

16:36.990 --> 16:37.979
LOOK, I...

16:38.100 --> 16:39.954
- OH, OKAY.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.368
I GET IT.

16:44.310 --> 16:45.334
- I SUPPORT HER DOING THIS.

16:45.450 --> 16:49.068
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
HOW REALISTIC IT IS.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.512
- OHH.
- REALLY?

16:51.630 --> 16:53.109
- SO GOOD.
- REALLY?

16:53.210 --> 16:55.144
- REALLY.
- CHICKEN. IT'S THE CHICKEN?

16:55.250 --> 16:56.387
- IT'S THE MAC AND CHEESE.

16:56.490 --> 16:58.549
- Al-TER WHAT
WE JUST SHARED,

16:58.670 --> 17:01.047
YOU WOULD RATHER STUFF CHICKEN
INTO YOUR MOUTH

17:01.150 --> 17:03.527
THAN LAY WITH
YOUR BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIEND?

17:03.640 --> 17:05.460
FIANCEE.
- I WANNA LAY.

17:05.570 --> 17:07.435
OKAY.
- YAY.

17:07.540 --> 17:08.632
- I'M NOT CHOOSING
ANYTHING OVER THIS.

17:08.750 --> 17:11.674
- OH, GOD HELP ME.

17:11.780 --> 17:15.159
[laughing]

17:15.270 --> 17:17.158
HI.
- HEY.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.067
- I FEEL ROMANTIC.
- RIGHT NOW?

17:19.170 --> 17:20.478
- MM-HMM.

17:20.590 --> 17:22.273
- [snickers]

17:22.380 --> 17:24.484
- MM, I HAVE QUESTIONS
FOR YOU.

17:24.590 --> 17:25.409
- HMM?

17:25.520 --> 17:26.896
- I WAN NA TALK ABOUT
OUR ENGAGEMENT.

17:27.010 --> 17:28.409
- MM-HMM?

17:28.530 --> 17:32.114
- I WANNA KNOW ALL THE DETAILS,
LIKE, MM...

17:32.220 --> 17:33.118
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.529
LIKE, DID YOU TELL
ALL YOUR FRIENDS

17:35.640 --> 17:36.561
YOU WERE GONNA ASK?

17:36.670 --> 17:37.182
WAS IT VERY ROMANTIC?

17:37.290 --> 17:39.326
WERE YOU NERVOUS?
YOU KNOW?

17:39.430 --> 17:40.112
WHAT WAS THE PLAN?
- YEAH, I WAS NERVOUS.

17:40.230 --> 17:41.777
- I WANNA KNOW ABOUT THE PLAN.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.189
- THE PLAN WAS...

17:44.300 --> 17:45.915
I SAW YOU WHEN I GOT OFF
THE TRANSPORT,

17:46.030 --> 17:48.260
AND I THOUGHT,
"SHE'S GORGEOUS.

17:48.370 --> 17:50.304
"PRETTIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD.

17:50.410 --> 17:51.308
"I WANNA SPEND
EVERY DAY WITH HER.

17:51.410 --> 17:53.856
I WANNA GET UP
EVERY MORNING WITH HER."

17:53.960 --> 17:57.202
AND I THOUGHT, "THAT'S IT.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.346
LET'S DO IT."
- "THAT'S IT"?

17:59.450 --> 18:01.486
- SPUR OF THE MOMENT.
- THERE'S NO...NO PLAN?

18:01.590 --> 18:03.000
IT WAS JUST
SPUR OF THE MOMENT?

18:03.110 --> 18:05.214
- YEAH.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.872
IT WAS AN EASY CHOICE TO MAKE.

18:23.480 --> 18:23.889
- [sighs]

18:23.990 --> 18:26.857
- YEAH, OKAY.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.928
I MEAN, IT'S GOOD...

18:29.030 --> 18:32.067
FOR A FIRST DRAI-T.

18:32.180 --> 18:34.512
NOT BAD.
I MADE SOME NOTES.

18:34.630 --> 18:36.416
BUT WE CAN GO OVER IT.
YOU KNOW...

18:36.520 --> 18:37.657
PUNCH IT UP A LITTLE BIT.

18:37.770 --> 18:40.409
- THAT'S REALLY, UM...

18:40.530 --> 18:43.351
THAT'S INTERESTING, 'CAUSE I'M
ACTUALLY A SPEECH WRITER, SO...

18:43.460 --> 18:44.529
- MM-HMM.
- YOU KNOW I WROTE

18:44.640 --> 18:46.289
BOB LITTLE'S SPEECHES.
- YEAH.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.970
- FOR WHEN HE WAS RUNNING
FOR COUNCILMAN.

18:48.090 --> 18:49.079
THEY WERE PRETTY GOOD.
- MM-HMM.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.567
- THERE'S A LOT
OF RED MARKS HERE.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.056
- OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A--

18:53.160 --> 18:54.388
IT'S A GOOD SPEECH, UM...
- THANKS.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.887
- I JUST THINK YOU GOTTA
COME OUT OF THE GATE SWINGING.

18:56.990 --> 18:58.981
- YES.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.499
- YOU MAKE
YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT SPEECH ONCE.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.064
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- FIRST IMPRESSION.

19:02.170 --> 19:03.307
YOU KNOW?
- YEP.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.583
- AND SO IT'S GOTTA BE GOOD.
- OKAY.

19:05.690 --> 19:07.169
- MATTER OF FACT,
IT'S GOTTA BE GREAT.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.827
- AND IT WILL BE.
I AGREE.

19:08.940 --> 19:09.895
- LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

19:10.010 --> 19:11.409
- THERE'S A LOT OF THEM,
SO I WILL.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.339
- YOU KNOW, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU...

19:12.460 --> 19:13.973
- YES?
- ABOUT ONE THING, THOUGH.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.104
- MM-HMM.
- ADAM.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.108
- MY HUSBAND.
- YEAH. YOUR HUSBAND.

19:17.220 --> 19:20.599
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?
- ARE YOU...

19:20.710 --> 19:24.362
ARE YOU SURE HE'S ON BOARD
WITH THIS CAMPAIGN?

19:24.470 --> 19:26.813
- YEAH.
- 100%?

19:26.920 --> 19:30.026
- 100%. HE'S SO EXCITED.
- HAS HE SAID THAT HE'S EXCITED?

19:30.130 --> 19:32.678
- DID HE--DID HE SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU,

19:32.790 --> 19:34.405
THAT HE WASN'T?

19:34.510 --> 19:36.785
- NOTHING SPECIFIC,
YOU KNOW.

19:36.890 --> 19:37.822
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...

19:37.930 --> 19:41.798
I COULD TELL THAT THERE
WASN'T THIS KIND OF

19:41.900 --> 19:44.061
ENTHUSIASM THAT YOU NEED
YOUR HUSBAND TO HAVE.

19:44.180 --> 19:47.900
- OH, I--WELL, HE'S
PROBABLY JUST, YOU KNOW,

19:48.010 --> 19:49.034
HE'S STRESSED OUT AT WORK.

19:49.150 --> 19:50.458
HE'S GOT A LOT
ON HIS PLATE.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.494
- MM-HMM.
- HIS BROTHER JUST HAD A BABY.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.012
SO HE'S TAKING OVER--
- OKAY. WELL, YOU GUYS

19:55.120 --> 19:58.157
ARE GONNA BE UNDER A MICROSCOPE
FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.114
- RIGHT.
- AND BROTHER HAVING A BABY

20:00.230 --> 20:02.266
OR NOT, HE'S GOTTA
SHOW ENTHUSIASM.

20:02.370 --> 20:03.598
- YES.
- YOU KNOW.

20:03.710 --> 20:06.406
- BECAUSE IF THERE'S
ANY HINT OF DISCORD,

20:06.510 --> 20:07.920
IF THERE IS AN OFF-THE-CUFF
REMARK, A LOOK,

20:08.030 --> 20:11.545
A NO-SHOW AT AN EVENT--
- HE'LL SHOW UP TO THOSE.

20:11.650 --> 20:13.993
- I KNOW HE WILL, BUT WILL HE
BE ENTHUSIASTIC, KRISTINA?

20:14.100 --> 20:15.658
- YES.
- BECAUSE IF HE'S NOT,

20:15.760 --> 20:16.988
IT COMES OFF LIKE
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN YOU,

20:17.110 --> 20:20.386
AND IF YOUR HUSBAND DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN YOU, WHO WILL?

20:20.490 --> 20:21.900
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
TALK TO HIM,

20:22.010 --> 20:24.456
BECAUSE THIS COULD BE DEATH
IN A GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN

20:24.560 --> 20:26.141
LIKE OURS, YOU KNOW.
- SURE.

20:26.250 --> 20:29.253
- THE SPOUSE NOT BELIEVING
IN THE CANDIDATE.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.520
SO JUST TALK TO HIM.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.631
IT'S WHAT THE MAYOR
WOULD DO, YOU KNOW.

20:51.940 --> 20:53.134
[roaring on TV]

20:53.250 --> 20:57.619
[shrieking on TV]

20:57.730 --> 20:59.209
- HEY.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.311
- AAH!
- BUDDY, HEY.

21:01.430 --> 21:02.909
HEY, HEY, HEY.
[snaps fingers]

21:03.020 --> 21:05.215
WILL YOU TURN THAT DOWN?
- HEY, DAD, READY FOR THE PARK?

21:05.330 --> 21:06.661
- NO, NO, BUDDY.
I NEED A MINUTE.

21:06.780 --> 21:07.565
WILL YOU--HEY,
TURN THAT DOWN.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.398
YOUR SISTER'S SLEEPING.
[groans]

21:09.500 --> 21:11.604
- COME ON, DAD, LET'S GO!
- NO, NO, NO.

21:11.710 --> 21:12.677
- COME ON, LET'S GO TO THE PARK.
LET'S SHOOT SOME HOOPS.

21:12.780 --> 21:14.122
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
COME HERE. JABBAR, STOP.

21:14.230 --> 21:15.504
STOP, STOP,
STOP, STOP, STOP.

21:15.610 --> 21:16.167
JABBAR, STOP...
- COME ON.

21:16.270 --> 21:18.022
WHAT ARE YOU--
HEY!

21:18.130 --> 21:20.166
LISTEN TO ME, YOU.

21:20.270 --> 21:22.340
I JUST ASKED YOU
TO TURN THIS DOWN.

21:22.450 --> 21:24.657
AND YOU COME OUT
AND YOU BOUNCE THE BASKETBALL?

21:24.760 --> 21:26.102
YOUR SISTER'S TRYING
TO SLEEP IN THERE.

21:26.210 --> 21:28.201
- I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T
DO ANYTHING!

21:28.320 --> 21:29.935
YOU ALWAYS TELL ME
TO BE QUIET.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.554
- LOWER YOUR VOICE.
- I DON'T CARE IF SHE WAKES UP!

21:32.670 --> 21:33.079
- YEAH, CLEARLY,
YOU DON'T CARE.

21:33.180 --> 21:35.660
- NO! I HATE YOU.

21:35.770 --> 21:36.668
- OKAY, COME ON.
COME HERE, COME HERE.

21:36.770 --> 21:37.327
LISTEN, LISTEN, COME HERE.
- NO...

21:37.430 --> 21:38.328
- OKAY, OKAY, LISTEN.

21:38.430 --> 21:42.491
HEY, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. LISTEN.

21:42.610 --> 21:44.123
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP
YOUR SISTER ASLEEP, OKAY?

21:44.230 --> 21:46.915
IF SHE WAKES UP,
SHE'S GONNA BE SCREAMING,

21:47.020 --> 21:48.578
YOUR MOM'S GONNA BE UPSET,
AND YOU AND I ARE BOTH

21:48.680 --> 21:50.739
GONNA BE IN TROUBLE,
ALL RIGHT?

21:50.860 --> 21:53.260
[sighs]
I'M SORRY I YELLED AT YOU.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.679
I TELL YOU WHAT.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT,

21:56.790 --> 21:57.927
YOU AND I GO
GET SOMETHING TO EAT,

21:58.040 --> 21:59.268
ALL OF US WILL GO,
BUT YOU'LL PICK, ALL RIGHT?

21:59.380 --> 22:02.065
AND THE WHOLE NIGHT'LL
BE ABOUT YOU.

22:02.180 --> 22:03.659
YEAH?
- ITALIAN KITCHEN?

22:03.770 --> 22:07.035
- YEAH, ITALIAN KITCHEN.
UNLIMITED BREADSTICKS.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.458
YOUR FAVORITE.
- YEAH.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.357
- SOI-T SERVE ICE CREAM.
- MM-HMM.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.451
- OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

22:12.570 --> 22:13.355
LET ME JUST GET
ON THE COUCH HERE

22:13.470 --> 22:16.291

FIVE-MINUTE NAP.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.083
YOU GONNA HANG OUT
WITH ME HERE?

22:18.190 --> 22:21.774
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

22:21.890 --> 22:24.882
- I THOUGHT BABIES
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.548
- YEAH, THEY'RE NOT.

22:26.650 --> 22:28.789
- OKAY, I JUST WANT
TO OFFICIALLY APOLOGIZE,

22:28.890 --> 22:31.029
'CAUSE I REALIZE THAT, UH,
IF I HADN'T FORGOTTEN

22:31.140 --> 22:34.485
MY KIDS' LUNCHES,
WE WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.

22:34.590 --> 22:37.479
- THAT'S FOR SURE, BUT...
- OHH, BOY.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.272
- [laughing]
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

22:38.390 --> 22:41.860
RECYCLING.
- YEP. I'M SORRY.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.426
MY WIFE IS USUALLY BETTER
WITH THE KID STUFF THAN I AM.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.009
I'M MUCH BETTER
IN THE OFFICE.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.326
- YEAH? WHAT DO YOU DO?

22:47.430 --> 22:49.159
- UH, I'M A BUSINESS GUY.

22:49.260 --> 22:50.704
FRANCHISE SALES.

22:50.810 --> 22:52.778

22:57.270 --> 22:59.545
I'M UNEMPLOYED.
[chuckles]

22:59.650 --> 23:00.742
- OH, YEAH?
- I KNOW, IT'S NOTHING BAD.

23:00.860 --> 23:02.088
I DIDN'T GET FIRED
OR ANYTHING.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.781
IT'S JUST I WORKED FOR
A BRICK-AND-MORTAR COMPANY

23:03.890 --> 23:07.098
IN AN INTERNET WORLD,
AND, UH...

23:07.210 --> 23:08.689
YEAH, NOBODY REALLY WANTS
TO DRIVE INTO THE STORE

23:08.800 --> 23:11.348
WHEN YOU CAN ORDER YOUR MARBLE
AND YOUR TILE ONLINE.

23:11.450 --> 23:15.034
LOOK AT THAT.
PERFECT LY GOOD APPLE.

23:15.150 --> 23:16.219
- COMPOST.

23:22.020 --> 23:24.909
DOWNSIZED. THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

23:25.020 --> 23:26.635
THAT'S MUCH BETTER
THAN UNEMPLOYED.

23:26.750 --> 23:27.944
UGH, IT'S WEIRD, TOO,
BECAUSE I--

23:28.060 --> 23:30.119
I HAVE ALL THIS EXTRA TIME,
YOU KNOW, WITH THE KIDS,

23:30.230 --> 23:32.539
WHICH IS AWESOME,
AND I LOVE IT, AND IT'S GREAT.

23:32.650 --> 23:34.572
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
THAT SOMETIMES

23:34.680 --> 23:37.752
I'M JUST A LITTLE...
INADEQUATE.

23:37.860 --> 23:42.069
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
WORKING IS IN MY DNA.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.990
AND I'M REDUCED TO THIS.

23:44.110 --> 23:46.317
OH, GOD.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.103
ANYWAY, ENOUGH
ABOUT MY SAD STORY.

23:48.210 --> 23:50.075
WHAT DO YOU DO?

23:50.180 --> 23:52.762
[plastic bags rustling]

23:52.870 --> 23:54.519

AT DENGRAF & PROSSLER.

24:02.820 --> 24:04.321
- OH, THAT'S A GOOD COMPANY.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.395
both: THAT'S
A REALLY GOOD FIRM.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.228
- WELL, WE SHOULD
HURRY UP HERE,

24:07.340 --> 24:08.193
'CAUSE YOU PROBABLY

24:08.300 --> 24:09.232
YOU KNOW, DEALS TO CLOSE

24:09.340 --> 24:12.548
AND CORPORATIONS
TO TAKE OVER.

24:12.650 --> 24:16.302
- OH, UM, NO.
I CONTROL MY OWN HOURS.

24:16.420 --> 24:17.444
SO...

24:17.550 --> 24:20.269

24:37.780 --> 24:40.055
UH, LOOK,

24:40.160 --> 24:41.229

I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A THING,
I JUST BROUGHT...

24:42.410 --> 24:44.264
A THING.

24:44.370 --> 24:45.405

WANNA COME IN?

24:48.100 --> 24:51.922
- YEAH. UH...WOW.
HEH.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.508

24:54.630 --> 24:55.722
RIGHT?
- WELL, IT'S A LOT OF STUFF

24:55.830 --> 24:58.549
FROM MY MOM'S ATTIC.
BOHEMIAN?

24:58.660 --> 25:00.799
- IT'S NICE. YEAH.

25:00.910 --> 25:02.423
- THAT'S A CANDLE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO...

25:02.530 --> 25:03.838
- OH! OH, DID YOU--
- LOOK AT IT.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.497
- DO YOU NOT WANT ME
TO OPEN IT?

25:05.600 --> 25:06.737
- YOU CAN OPEN IT.
- OKAY.

25:06.850 --> 25:09.353
- IT'S NO SURPRISE.
IT'S A...CANDLE.

25:09.470 --> 25:11.324
IT'S "PINK OCEAN,"
THE LADY TOLD ME.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.395
- OH.
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:12.510 --> 25:13.431
SHE HAD A PIERCED EYEBROW,

25:13.540 --> 25:15.883
SO I DON'T KNOW
IF I TRUST HER.

25:15.990 --> 25:17.469
- IT SMELLS JUST LIKE
A PINK OCEAN.

25:17.580 --> 25:18.854
IT'S VERY NICE.
THANK YOU.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.234
I LIKE IT.
- ANYWAY, LISTEN.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.376
MAX CAME BY THE STUDIO.
- OH, YEAH, I HEARD THAT, UM,

25:22.480 --> 25:27.179
HE'S GOT A CAMERA FIXED
OR SOMETHING.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.692
- YEAH, BUT HE'S COME BACK
A COUPLE TIMES.

25:29.800 --> 25:30.414
I THINK HE'S GOT
THE PHOTOGRAPHY BUG.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.317
- OHH.
- SO THAT'S GOOD.

25:32.420 --> 25:34.832
- SO YOU HAVE A NEW PROTEGE.

25:34.940 --> 25:36.111
- KIND OF, I GUESS.
BUT HERE'S THE THING:

25:36.220 --> 25:39.633
HE TOLD ME THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS GETTING ENGAGED.

25:39.740 --> 25:41.184
- YEAH, SHE'S
GETTING MARRIED.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.109
- YEAH. YEAH.
- YEP.

25:42.230 --> 25:44.186
- THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
I JUST THOUGHT,

25:44.300 --> 25:46.882
AS A FRIEND, JUST...

25:46.990 --> 25:48.434
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
WE ARE...

25:48.540 --> 25:51.953
UH, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
I'D JUST COME BY,

25:52.060 --> 25:53.266
SEE HOW YOU'RE
DOING WITH IT.

25:53.370 --> 25:54.689
- THANK YOU.
YEAH, WE'RE JUST...

25:54.790 --> 25:59.204
UM, VERY EXCITED
AND, UM, HAPPY FOR HER.

25:59.310 --> 26:00.823
- OH...WELL, GOOD, THEN.

26:00.930 --> 26:01.749
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

26:01.870 --> 26:03.553
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

26:03.660 --> 26:04.513
- BECAUSE--
- THANK YOU, I KNOW.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.938
IT'S A LITTLE RUSHED.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.268
JUST FEELS A LITTLE TOO SOON
TO ME.

26:07.390 --> 26:09.620
- THAT WHAT IT SEEMS.
- AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST--

26:09.740 --> 26:11.219
I DON'T KNOW HIM AS WELL
AS I'D LIKE TO KNOW HIM,

26:11.320 --> 26:13.732
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HURRY IS, YOU KNOW?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.876
THEY'RE SO YOUNG,
I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,

26:15.980 --> 26:17.390
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DON'T JUST
MOVE IN TOGETHER FOR A WHILE.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.980
BUT ANYWAY--ANYWAY--

26:20.090 --> 26:21.466
- WELL, ARE YOU GONNA
TALK TO HER ABOUT IT?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.434
- AND SAY WHAT?

26:23.540 --> 26:25.428
- SAY WHAT YOU
JUST SAID TO ME.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.405
- OH, I CAN'T
SAY THAT TO HER.

26:27.510 --> 26:29.068
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO HEAR THAT FROM ME.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.785
SHE'S VERY TOUCHY
ABOUT MY OPINIONS.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.687
- SO WHAT?
YOU KNOW, JUST...

26:32.790 --> 26:33.472
ONE OF THE BIGGEST
DECISIONS OF HER LIFE.

26:33.590 --> 26:35.512
YOU GONNA LET HER DO IT--

26:35.620 --> 26:38.441
COME ON, LOOK, WE BOTH
HAD CRAP MARRIAGES.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.585
- VERY CRAP.
- RIGHT? SO...

26:40.700 --> 26:41.485
I WISH SOMEBODY
WOULD HAVE TALKED TO ME

26:41.600 --> 26:43.739
BEFORE I WALKED
DOWN THE AISLE.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.421
YOU GOTTA TELL HER
THE TRUTH.

26:45.530 --> 26:48.704
SO WHAT IF YOU
PISS HER OFF?

26:48.810 --> 26:50.391
- YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.889
DO YOU WANNA...
GET A DRINK...

26:56.990 --> 26:58.025
- YOU KNOW, I GOTTA GO.
- OR YOU GOTTA GO?

26:58.130 --> 26:59.574
- YEAH, I GOTTA GO. YEAH.
- OKAY.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.614
- THIS IS NICE, THOUGH.
- THANK YOU.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.926
- YOU CAN RETURN THAT
IF YOU WANT.

27:03.030 --> 27:04.782
- I'M NOT GONNA RETURN
MY CANDLE.

27:04.890 --> 27:05.515
- IT'S NICE HERE, THOUGH.
IT'S PRETTY COOL.

27:05.620 --> 27:07.440
- THANK YOU.

27:07.550 --> 27:08.619

27:08.730 --> 27:09.992
[chuckles]

27:10.110 --> 27:12.556
- "THIS IS MY VISION
AND A VISION FOR OUR FUTURE

27:28.540 --> 27:29.677
- THAT WAS GREAT.

27:29.780 --> 27:31.463
REALLY? I--

27:31.580 --> 27:33.719
- YEAH, IT WAS A LOT
OF GOOD THEMES.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.197
- GOOD THEMES?
- WHAT?

27:36.300 --> 27:39.019
- NOTHING, YOU JUST
SOUNDED LIKE MY TEACHER.

27:39.140 --> 27:40.209
- I'M JUST SAYING THAT--
- IN EIGHTH GRADE.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.754
- IF I WERE A VOTER,
AND I HEARD THE SPEECH,

27:41.860 --> 27:43.418
THAT I WOULD
WANT TO VOTE FOR YOU.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.612
THAT'S ALL.
IT'S GOOD.

27:44.730 --> 27:47.699
- HONEY, YOU ARE A VOTER.
AND, UM, YOU KNOW...

27:47.800 --> 27:49.244
- WHAT DID I SAY?
- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

27:49.350 --> 27:51.170
I THINK YOU'RE REGISTERED,
SO I HOPE THAT YOU'D VOTE.

27:51.290 --> 27:53.804
I JUST FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE NOT BEING SUPPORTIVE.

27:53.910 --> 27:56.356
- KRISTINA, I'M YOUR HUSBAND.
I'M SUPPORTIVE.

27:56.460 --> 27:57.142
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.522
- BECAUSE I TALKED
TO HEATHER,

27:58.640 --> 27:59.493
AND SHE SAID THAT YOU
WERE A LITTLE,

27:59.600 --> 28:00.840
YOU KNOW, RESISTANT.

28:00.950 --> 28:02.531
MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE A PART OF THIS.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.675
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT HEATHER SAYS.

28:03.780 --> 28:04.940
HEATHER SAT IN HER OFFICE
FOR TWO HOURS

28:05.060 --> 28:05.810
AND ASKED ME A BUNCH
OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.670
YEAH, IT MADE ME
FEEL RESISTANT.

28:06.780 --> 28:08.839
- OKAY, I GET IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:08.960 --> 28:09.608
I'M ABOUT TO GO OUT THERE
AND MAKE A SPEECH

28:09.720 --> 28:11.711
IN FRONT
OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.196
- I KNOW.
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

28:13.310 --> 28:15.198
- NOTHING.
- CAN YOU JUST TELL ME, HONEY?

28:15.310 --> 28:17.062
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING EVASIVE
AND JUST NOT TELLING ME--

28:17.170 --> 28:18.410
- ALL RIGHT,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

28:18.520 --> 28:21.068
- DOING WHAT?
- REALLY. WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?

28:21.180 --> 28:23.034
- ADAM, YOU KNOW
WHY I'M RUNNING.

28:23.140 --> 28:27.099
I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE.
I WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

28:27.220 --> 28:28.869
I KNOW THAT I CAN
BE A GOOD MAYOR.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.902
- OKAY.
- ADAM...

28:31.010 --> 28:32.591
I JUST--I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE,

28:32.710 --> 28:35.156
AND I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE THAT LIGHTLY.

28:35.260 --> 28:37.182
I'M NOT.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.608
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD PUT THAT IN YOUR SPEECH.

28:38.710 --> 28:41.577
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL AWFUL

28:41.680 --> 28:43.090
RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A JERK.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.224
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO!

28:44.340 --> 28:45.819
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

28:45.930 --> 28:46.954
- I HAVE--
- I SEE YOU GETTING STRESSED OUT

28:47.070 --> 28:48.264
NOW--THIS IS WHAT
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

28:48.380 --> 28:50.757
EVERY DOCTOR THAT WE TALKED TO
SAID THAT YOU SHOULD

28:50.860 --> 28:51.963
MANAGE YOUR STRESS LEVEL.
- I'M NOT--

28:52.070 --> 28:54.129
THIS IS MAKING ME STRESSED
RIGHT NOW!

28:54.240 --> 28:56.447
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME
IS MAKING ME STRESSED.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.584
- JUST LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

28:57.700 --> 28:58.894
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE EATING WELL.

28:59.010 --> 29:00.284
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE RESTING,
EXERCISING.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.358
- I FEEL FINE.
- I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST SIT BACK

29:02.460 --> 29:03.870
AND BE SUPPORTIVE AND LET YOU
GO INTO WHAT IS PROBABLY

29:03.980 --> 29:05.971
GOING TO BE THE MOST STRESSFUL
TWO MONTHS OF YOUR LIFE

29:06.080 --> 29:07.149
AND JUST LET THAT HAPPEN?

29:07.260 --> 29:08.704
- NO, IT'S NOT...

29:08.810 --> 29:10.152
- KRISTINA,
CAN YOU LISTEN TO ME?

29:10.260 --> 29:11.568
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU--
- I'M LISTENING TO YOU.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.817
- I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU HAVE
TO BATTLE CANCER AGAIN.

29:12.920 --> 29:13.466
YOU ALMOST DIED!
- I'M NOT GONNA!

29:18.820 --> 29:22.995
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE 100% RIGHT.

29:23.100 --> 29:26.137
I ALMOST DIED.
BUT I DIDN'T.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.549
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY I'M DOING THIS.

29:28.660 --> 29:32.312
[crying]

29:52.480 --> 29:56.473
[baby screaming]
- COME ON, COME ON.

29:56.580 --> 29:58.332
[screaming continues]

29:58.450 --> 30:01.681
- MOM, THE BABY'S REALLY LOUD.
IT'S REALLY EM BARRASSING.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.587
[baby screaming]

30:04.690 --> 30:05.861
- YOU WANT MORE BREADSTICKS,
BUD?

30:05.970 --> 30:08.939
- MMM, THEY'RE GOOD.
- YEAH?

30:09.040 --> 30:10.689
- WELL, I'M TRYING.
SHE'S NOT TAKING THE NIPPLE.

30:10.800 --> 30:11.664
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SHE WON'T TAKE IT?

30:11.770 --> 30:13.761
SHE'S--SHE'S HUNGRY, RIGHT?

30:13.880 --> 30:15.256
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.281
- UGH!

30:16.400 --> 30:17.560
OKAY, WELL, JUST,
WE'LL ALL STAY RELAXED.

30:17.670 --> 30:19.638
IF YOU GET STRESSED,

30:19.740 --> 30:20.980
THEN YOU'LL PASS ON
THE STRESS TO HER.

30:21.090 --> 30:21.909
- I'M IN A RESTAURANT
WITH MY BOOB HANGING OUT.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.079
YOU RELAX.
- HONEY, I'M NOT SAYING

30:24.200 --> 30:25.770
YOU'RE DOING ANYTHING WRONG,
I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE--

30:25.890 --> 30:27.710
MAYBE SWAY--
OH, GOOD, GOOD.

30:27.820 --> 30:30.095
HERE COMES THE LITTLE
MINIATURE NAPOLEON.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.758
HERE HE_IS.
[crying continues]

30:31.860 --> 30:34.021
- HEY, GUYS. SO, UM...
- HEY.

30:34.140 --> 30:35.823
- TWO MORE COMPLAINTS.

30:35.930 --> 30:36.965
- HUH. OKAY.

30:37.070 --> 30:38.241
WELL, WE'RE DEALING
WITH THAT,

30:38.350 --> 30:38.930
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE COULD
USE SOME REFILLS HERE.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.270
- YES, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

30:41.390 --> 30:42.584
- I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT I'M
GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

30:42.700 --> 30:43.769
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

30:43.870 --> 30:45.667
- LIKE WHEN
WE'RE DONE EATING,

30:45.770 --> 30:46.839
YOU'RE GONNA ASK US
TO LEAVE.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.498
- NO, I MEAN--
- I DON'T WANNA GO.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.635
- I UNDERSTAND, SWEETIE.
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME

30:49.740 --> 30:50.638
WE CAN COME BACK.
- OKAY.

30:50.740 --> 30:51.809
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

30:51.910 --> 30:54.014
THIS IS MY SON'S NIGHT.
HE GOT TO PICK.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.462
- I UNDERSTAND.
- THIS IS HIS FAVORITE PLACE.

30:55.570 --> 30:57.151
- I UNDERSTAND.
- YOU'RE NOT KICKING HIM OUT

30:57.260 --> 30:59.296
BECAUSE THERE'S A BABY THAT'S
MAKING A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.844
EVERYONE CAN JUST KIND OF
MAN UP AND HANDLE IT.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.439
ALL RIGHT?
- I TR--UHH.

31:02.550 --> 31:04.438
- OR THEY CAN PUT SOME NAPKIN
IN THEIR EAR OR SOMETHING.

31:04.550 --> 31:05.403
- UM, SIR--SIR--
- 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT LEAVING HERE.

31:05.510 --> 31:06.920
- SIR, PEOPLE ARE
REALLY COMPLAINING.

31:07.030 --> 31:07.849
- JUST CALM DOWN.
- REALLY? WHO'S COMPLAINING?

31:07.960 --> 31:08.824
- EVERYBODY!
EVERYBODY'S COMPLAINING.

31:08.930 --> 31:11.160
- OH, EVERYONE'S COMPLAINING?
- YES!

31:11.280 --> 31:12.486
- CROSBY,
DON'T MAKE A BIG SCENE.

31:12.590 --> 31:13.625
- I WANNA MEET THE ONE PERSON
WHO IS COMPLAINING,

31:13.730 --> 31:15.004
SO I CAN ASK THEM TO LEAVE.
MAYBE THEY SHOULD LEAVE.

31:15.110 --> 31:16.270
WHAT'S THEIR BILL?
MAYBE OURS IS MORE.

31:16.390 --> 31:17.937
- SIR--
- WHO'S--WHICH ONE OF YOU GUYS

31:18.040 --> 31:18.790
IS COMPLAINING, HUH?
YOU?

31:18.910 --> 31:21.071
OH, REALLY?
GUY WITH THE KID.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.216
YOUR KID NEVER CRIED? YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN IN THIS SITUATION?

31:23.320 --> 31:24.708
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN A CLUB.
- TAKE IT OUTSIDE!

31:24.810 --> 31:26.323
- OH, YOU WANNA GO OUTSIDE
WITH ME?

31:26.430 --> 31:27.772
I WOULD LOVE THAT!
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE

31:27.880 --> 31:29.154
THE OUTCOME OF THAT.

31:29.260 --> 31:30.488
- I'LL BE HAPPY TO BOX UP
EVERYTHING FOR YOU,

31:30.610 --> 31:31.986
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO.
- OH, YEAH, LET'S SAY YEAH.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.603
BOX THIS UP.
BOX THIS UP.

31:33.710 --> 31:35.268
AND WHY DON'T YOU BOX THAT UP,
TOO, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, OKAY?

31:35.370 --> 31:36.814
AND AS MUCH AS I ONLY THINK THIS
MEAL WAS WORTH ABOUT 6 BUCKS,

31:36.920 --> 31:38.888
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND LEAVE YOU 40,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.752
BECAUSE I HAVE CLASS!
UNLIKE YOU GUYS.

31:40.860 --> 31:42.612
_ I'M--
- IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE SOUND

31:42.720 --> 31:45.894
OF A BABY CRYING, WHICH IS
THE SOUND OF LIFE, EVERYBODY!

31:46.000 --> 31:48.275
UNLIKE THIS FOOD,
WHICH IS CANCEROUS

31:48.380 --> 31:49.620
AND SHOULD BE SERVED
ON AN AIRPLANE.

31:49.730 --> 31:50.719
MAKE SURE YOU
BOX THAT ALL UP.

31:50.830 --> 31:52.309
OKAY.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.456
[approaching footsteps]

31:57.570 --> 31:58.969
- HELLO?

31:59.080 --> 32:00.012
AH.
- HEY.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.736
- HI.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:02.850 --> 32:04.841
- OH, I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

32:04.950 --> 32:06.087
LIKE I ALWAYS AM NOW.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.224
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

32:07.330 --> 32:08.297
WE GONNA DRINK
ALL THOSE RIGHT NOW?

32:08.400 --> 32:09.879
- I THINK SO.
- ALL RIGHT.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.958
I'M GAME.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.687
CRACK THAT FOR YOU?

32:13.790 --> 32:16.065
- [sighs]
- THERE YOU GO.

32:16.170 --> 32:17.546
- THANKS.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:17.650 --> 32:19.857
- AH, JUST, YOU KNOW.
- WANDERING THE STREETS?

32:19.970 --> 32:24.009
- YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.
[chuckles]

32:24.110 --> 32:25.896
- WHAT'S UP?
- HEY, WHAT IS UP?

32:26.010 --> 32:26.658
WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR KID
AND MY EX-BOYFRIEND

32:26.770 --> 32:28.692
BEING FRIENDS?

32:28.800 --> 32:31.075
- YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT
MIGHT BE A LITTLE AWKWARD.

32:31.190 --> 32:33.010
BUT IT'S--
MAX IS INTO PHOTOGRAPHY,

32:33.120 --> 32:34.394
HE WANDERED
INTO HANK'S STUDIO,

32:34.500 --> 32:36.013
AND HANK'S KIND OF TAKEN HIM
UNDER HIS WING.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.564
I HOPE IT'S NOT
A PROBLEM, SO--

32:37.670 --> 32:38.739
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

32:38.850 --> 32:40.124
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE
WAS DOING AT MY PLACE TODAY.

32:41.370 --> 32:42.644
- REALLY?

32:42.750 --> 32:43.364
- YEAH.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

32:43.470 --> 32:45.984
- I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S WEIRD.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.330
A CANDLE.
- [sighs]

32:48.440 --> 32:49.782
- AND, HEY,
AMBER GETTING MARRIED.

32:49.890 --> 32:50.822
HOW ABOUT THAT, HUH?
- [scoffs]

32:50.930 --> 32:54.104
OH, ADAM, I MEAN,
WHAT IS THAT?

32:54.210 --> 32:55.962
- SARAH, LOOK, THEY'RE YOUNG.
THEY'RE IN LOVE, I MEAN--

32:56.070 --> 32:58.891
- RYAN IS A GREAT GUY,
BUT HE...

32:59.010 --> 33:02.104
HE'S HAD SOME ISSUES.
- RIGHT.

33:02.220 --> 33:04.427
- WHO SOMETIMES
GETS IN FIGHTS

33:04.530 --> 33:07.761
AND SOMETIMES...
TAKES PILLS, AND...

33:07.880 --> 33:09.142
- BUT ISN'T THAT
IN THE PAST?

33:09.260 --> 33:11.728
I MEAN, HE'S DEALING
WITH THE PTSD.

33:11.850 --> 33:13.056
SEEMS LIKE
HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.491
- I DON'T KNOW.

33:14.610 --> 33:16.498
- I LIKE HIM.
I THINK HE'S A GOOD GUY.

33:16.610 --> 33:18.771
- I LIKE HIM TOO, BUT...
I DON'T KNOW.

33:18.890 --> 33:21.199
MARRIAGE. IT'S--

33:21.300 --> 33:23.814
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
MAKE A BIG MISTAKE.

33:23.930 --> 33:25.955
IT JUST SEEMS TOO SOON.

33:26.070 --> 33:27.856
DON'T YOU THINK?
SHOULDN'T I SAY SOMETHING?

33:27.970 --> 33:29.130
- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE, ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT--LISTEN.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.684
HERE'S WHY
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.722
OKAY? YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU AND SETH CAME HOME,

33:32.830 --> 33:33.967
ANNOUNCED THAT YOU WERE ENGAGED,
AND DAD FLEW OFF THE HANDLE,

33:34.080 --> 33:36.310
AND YOU GUYS
GOT INTO A BIG FIGHT,

33:36.420 --> 33:39.309
YOU WOULDN'T TALK TO DAD,
AND THEN YOU AND SETH ELOPED?

33:39.430 --> 33:41.523
SARAH, WE DIDN'T SEE YOU GUYS
FOR A LONG TIME.

33:41.640 --> 33:45.110
- WELL...I'M NOT DAD.

33:45.230 --> 33:46.777
- MAYBE RYAN ISN'T SETH.
OKAY?

33:46.880 --> 33:47.847
MAYBE HE'S GOT SOME ISSUES,

33:47.950 --> 33:49.747
BUT MAYBE HE CAN
WORK THROUGH THEM.

33:49.850 --> 33:52.125
SO LET THEM...

33:52.230 --> 33:53.367
I'M JUST SAYING,
DON'T DO ANYTHING

33:53.470 --> 33:53.982
THAT'S GONNA DRIVE
AMBER AWAY.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.330
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

33:56.440 --> 33:57.816
IF THEY'RE GONNA GET MARRIED,
THEY'RE GONNA GET MARRIED.

33:57.930 --> 34:00.137
- SHE'S NOT GONNA ELOPE,
IS SHE?

34:00.240 --> 34:02.094
[sighs]
OH, NO.

34:02.210 --> 34:05.373
[folk pop music]

34:05.490 --> 34:08.175
[hammering]

34:10.460 --> 34:11.791
- HEY, SWEETIE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.

34:11.910 --> 34:14.731
- YEAH, I KNOW.

34:14.840 --> 34:18.082
- YOU COMING TO BED?
- YEAH.

34:18.190 --> 34:18.975
YEAH, AS SOON AS I, UH...

34:19.090 --> 34:21.672
YOU KNOW,
THAT KID WAS RIGHT.

34:21.780 --> 34:25.773
MAN, THERE IS...DRY ROT
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS THING.

34:25.890 --> 34:27.289
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I MISSED IT.

34:31.690 --> 34:34.158
- [sighs]
OH, WHAT ARE WE DOING, ZEEK?

34:34.270 --> 34:36.340
- WELL, I'M TRYING TO SAVE MONEY
ON A NEW ALARM SYSTEM.

34:36.450 --> 34:38.304
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
- YES, I KNOW.

34:38.420 --> 34:40.172
BUT IT'S NOT
JUST THE WINDOWS.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.963
IT'S THE DRAIN
IN THE GUEST BATHROOM.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.968
AND THE SCREENS
ON THE SIDE PORCH.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.286
IT'S THE RAILING OUT HERE.

34:45.390 --> 34:47.426
YOU KNOW THERE'S A NEW LEAK
IN THE UTILITY ROOM?

34:47.530 --> 34:48.428
- HUH.
- I'M TELLING YOU,

34:48.530 --> 34:49.519
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A NEW ROOF.

34:49.630 --> 34:50.949
- WELL...WELL, I THINK
THAT ROOF'S OKAY.

34:51.050 --> 34:54.019
I'LL GET UP THERE
AND CHECK IT TOMORROW.

34:54.120 --> 34:57.533
[tools clattering]

35:00.540 --> 35:04.476
[hammering]

35:04.580 --> 35:06.810
- HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT ABOUT DOWNSIZING?

35:06.930 --> 35:07.919
MAYBE?

35:08.030 --> 35:12.239
YOU KNOW, MOVE INTO
A SMALLER PLACE?

35:12.350 --> 35:13.032
- YOU MEAN LIKE
A RETIREMENT HOME?

35:13.140 --> 35:16.029
- [laughs]
RETIREMENT HOME?

35:16.140 --> 35:17.869
- YEAH.
- NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT

35:17.970 --> 35:19.141
A CONDOMINIUM.
- MM-HMM.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.834
- CLOSE TO MUSEUMS.
WE COULD WALK TO RESTAURANTS.

35:22.940 --> 35:25.875
YOU KNOW, WE'D BE SURROUNDED
BY ALL THAT CULTURE.

35:25.980 --> 35:26.901
- OH, YEAH, WHOOPEE.

35:27.020 --> 35:29.420
I DON'T CARE
FOR THE CITY, REALLY.

35:29.540 --> 35:30.939
I KIND OF LIKE IT HERE.

35:31.050 --> 35:34.156
- YOU LOVE IT HERE.

35:34.270 --> 35:36.431
AND S0 DO I.

35:36.540 --> 35:38.053
THIS HOUSE IS A PART OF US.

35:38.170 --> 35:41.196
WE RAISED OUR BABIES HERE.

35:43.380 --> 35:47.100
WE MADE A LOT
OF MEMORIES HERE.

35:47.210 --> 35:49.178
BUT, UH...YOU KNOW,
LET'S FACE IT.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.965
THAT--THE KIDS DON'T
COME AROUND HALF AS MUCH

35:52.080 --> 35:52.865
AS THEY USED TO.
- YEAH, THEY DO.

35:52.970 --> 35:55.837
- AND THE GUEST HOUSE
IS STANDING THERE EMPTY.

35:55.940 --> 35:57.555
- HEY, COME ON, THEY WERE HERE
SUNDAY, YOU KNOW?

35:57.670 --> 35:59.490
- ALL WE DO IS PUTTER
AROUND THE HOUSE ALL DAY,

35:59.600 --> 36:01.488
WAITING FOR THE MAIL
TO COME.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.908
I MEAN, DON'T YOU EVER
WANT MORE?

36:03.020 --> 36:05.705
- [sighs]

36:05.810 --> 36:07.983
[tools clatter]

36:08.090 --> 36:10.888
MORE WHAT?
- EVERYTHING.

36:10.990 --> 36:12.605
LIFE.

36:12.720 --> 36:13.926
YOU KNOW, IF WE WERE
IN A CONDO,

36:14.030 --> 36:15.054
YOU WOULDN'T BE SPENDING
ALL YOUR TIME FIXING THINGS.

36:15.170 --> 36:17.229
WE COULD DO STUFF.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.648
WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.547
TRAVEL, GO PLACES.
HAVE ADVENTURES.

36:21.660 --> 36:24.515
AND WE'D HAVE
THE MONEY TO DO IT.

36:24.630 --> 36:27.622
I MEAN, THIS IS IT.
SEE?

36:27.730 --> 36:31.734
THIS IS THE START
OF OUR ACT THREE.

36:33.290 --> 36:37.283
I JUST DON'T WANT TO LET IT
SLIP AWAY.

36:38.290 --> 36:41.054
- SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT
TO SELL OUR HOUSE.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.641
- I THINK WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT IT.

37:08.670 --> 37:10.900
- GET IN THERE.
- MORNING.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.419
- OH! HEY, JULIA.

37:12.540 --> 37:13.222
- LOOK WHO'S ON TIME
WHEN IT DOESN'T MATTER.

37:13.330 --> 37:16.675
- AH, WELL. [scoffs]
- I KNOW.

37:16.780 --> 37:17.940
- COME ON, THAT WAS
ALL PART OF THE MASTER PLAN.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.460
YOU KNOW, I NEEDED SOMEBODY
ELSE ON MY SUSTAINABILITY TEAM.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.571
- WELL, GOOD WORK.
- [laughs]

37:22.680 --> 37:25.854
- UM, HEY, I ACTUALLY HAVE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.827
- WHAT'S UP?

37:28.930 --> 37:32.889
- I, UM, DON'T WORK FOR
DENGRAF AND PROSSLER ANYMORE.

37:33.000 --> 37:33.932
- OH, NO.
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:34.040 --> 37:36.144
- NO, I-I HAVEN'T WORKED
FOR THEM FOR A YEAR.

37:36.250 --> 37:39.936
I-I QUIT.
THEY WOULD HAVE FIRED ME ANYWAY

37:40.050 --> 37:40.937
FOR THE MISTAKE
THAT I MADE.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.005
I JUST--
I LIED TO YOU ABOUT IT,

37:42.120 --> 37:44.907
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT I FELT
THE NEED TO DO THAT,

37:45.020 --> 37:46.180
BUT I DID, AND I'M SORRY.

37:46.290 --> 37:50.431
- WOW.
THAT'S MESSED UP.

37:50.540 --> 37:52.952
I REALLY DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD HANG OUT ANYMORE.

37:54.130 --> 37:56.121
- OKAY.
- REALLY?

37:56.230 --> 37:58.994
