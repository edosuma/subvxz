00:00.237 --> 00:03.204
<i>Previously on "Devious Maids"...</i>

00:03.206 --> 00:05.904
The man that raped her
is not the father of her baby.

00:05.906 --> 00:08.103
And there is some kind
of connection between them.

00:08.105 --> 00:09.603
So which one killed her?

00:09.605 --> 00:11.137
I just wanna talk to you
about your granddaughter.

00:11.139 --> 00:12.204
Flora?

00:12.206 --> 00:13.637
I have cancer.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.237
But you don't have to worry
about getting things done.

00:15.239 --> 00:16.937
I can do both jobs.

00:16.939 --> 00:18.336
Remi is using drugs.

00:18.338 --> 00:19.371
Cocaine?

00:19.373 --> 00:20.537
You're going back to rehab.

00:20.539 --> 00:23.104
Valentina told you,
didn't she?

00:23.106 --> 00:24.205
Olivia wasn't able
to give him a baby.

00:24.207 --> 00:25.572
And he left her.

00:25.574 --> 00:28.105
He left Olivia because
she's a loon and a half.

00:28.107 --> 00:30.905
Doesn't Michael love me? No.

00:30.907 --> 00:32.305
I am sorry.

00:32.307 --> 00:34.038
not enough
to say, "I'm sorry,"

00:34.040 --> 00:36.372
When you've ruined
someone's life.

00:36.374 --> 00:38.072
I do love him, Rosie.

00:38.074 --> 00:39.505
So I'm gonna change for him.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.172
Be the best wife ever.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.205
Mrs. Peri wants
to make you happy.

00:43.207 --> 00:44.505
Well, she had her chance.

00:44.507 --> 00:46.549
You gotta give her another one.

00:56.701 --> 00:58.502
I have something important
to say.

00:58.504 --> 01:00.001
Oh, God.

01:00.003 --> 01:03.900
Your heart attack
was very traumatic for me.

01:03.902 --> 01:05.801
I'm sorry that you didn't have

01:05.803 --> 01:08.166
The rip-roaring good time
that I had.

01:09.767 --> 01:11.498
I'm serious.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.799
Seeing you in the hospital
made me realize

01:13.801 --> 01:15.730
What a lousy wife I've been.

01:15.732 --> 01:17.596
And I wanna make
this marriage work.

01:17.598 --> 01:19.763
So to do that...

01:19.765 --> 01:21.896
I think we need therapy.

01:21.898 --> 01:22.996
Therapy?

01:22.998 --> 01:25.427
Obviously, I have anger issues.

01:25.429 --> 01:27.894
I think it goes back
to my father.

01:27.896 --> 01:31.627
You know, he started drinking
right after I was born.

01:31.629 --> 01:33.992
Probably just a coincidence.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.124
Are you <i>trying</i>
<i>to antagonize me?</i>

01:37.126 --> 01:38.658
Look, I don't want to hear you
blame someone else

01:38.660 --> 01:39.857
For the way you act.

01:39.859 --> 01:41.024
Okay.

01:41.026 --> 01:45.723
That's fair.

01:45.725 --> 01:49.456
So... Will you go with me?

01:52.689 --> 01:53.920
Fine.

01:53.922 --> 01:57.453
I will go to therapy.

01:57.455 --> 01:59.986
good.

01:59.988 --> 02:02.952
This way, you can also
work on some of <i>your</i> issues.

02:02.954 --> 02:04.018
I don't have any issues.

02:05.952 --> 02:09.015
So I have a major flaw.

02:09.018 --> 02:12.016
Great. Come on. Let's hear it.

02:12.018 --> 02:13.982
You're terrified of conflict.

02:13.984 --> 02:14.849
How could I be terrified
of conflict?

02:14.851 --> 02:16.115
I'm married to <i>you.</i>

02:16.117 --> 02:19.615
If a waiter spills on you,
you apologize.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.180
If someone takes a parking spot
you've been waiting for,

02:21.182 --> 02:22.813
You say, "oh, well."

02:22.815 --> 02:25.080
You are <i>so</i> determined
to be a nice guy,

02:25.082 --> 02:26.812
You refuse to stand up
for yourself...

02:26.814 --> 02:29.011
Not to your boss,
not to your agents,

02:29.013 --> 02:31.010
And especially not to me!

02:31.012 --> 02:32.677
Wait. I'm sorry.
The flaw in our marriage

02:32.679 --> 02:35.009
Is we don't fight enough?
Oh, for God sake, Spence!

02:35.011 --> 02:37.710
If I can admit
I'm a raging bitch,

02:37.712 --> 02:39.642
Surely you can admit
you're a wuss!

02:41.009 --> 02:42.608
So...

02:42.610 --> 02:46.408
Who wants cake? Huh?

03:02.072 --> 03:03.935
Phillipe just called.

03:03.937 --> 03:05.903
The limo is pulling
onto sunset.

03:05.904 --> 03:07.835
Are you done with the balloons?

03:07.837 --> 03:09.668
Almost.

03:09.670 --> 03:11.801
Valentina, why don't you
sound excited?

03:11.803 --> 03:13.533
Remi's gonna be here
any second.

03:13.535 --> 03:16.032
She's afraid to see him.
She thinks he's angry with her.

03:16.034 --> 03:17.665
Angry?

03:17.667 --> 03:19.599
I promised not to tell anyone
about his drugs.

03:19.601 --> 03:21.031
He had to go to rehab
because of me.

03:21.033 --> 03:24.464
That's just silly.
Remi knows he needed help.

03:24.466 --> 03:26.096
Then why hasn't he called me?

03:26.098 --> 03:27.929
I haven't heard from him
in a month.

03:27.931 --> 03:29.996
People in rehab are busy.

03:29.998 --> 03:33.661
There are therapy sessions,
yoga classes, meditation.

03:33.663 --> 03:35.094
It's a lot like a spa...

03:35.096 --> 03:38.461
Except for all the people
crying and shaking.

03:39.462 --> 03:40.659
Ah! They're here.

03:40.661 --> 03:42.127
Quick, put that away.

03:43.627 --> 03:44.759
Maybe you're right.

03:44.761 --> 03:45.924
Maybe Remi <i>is</i> angry with you.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.558
I know he is.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.125
Well, if he walks in that door
and gives you attitude,

03:49.127 --> 03:51.157
What will you do? I'll die!

03:51.159 --> 03:52.889
no. You
will hold your head up high

03:52.891 --> 03:54.723
Because you did
the right thing.

03:54.724 --> 03:57.622
And if he can't see that,
well...

03:57.624 --> 03:59.655
He's too stupid to love.

03:59.657 --> 04:00.920
Please don't say that.

04:02.124 --> 04:03.754
Hey, everybody!

04:03.756 --> 04:06.986
Look who I found
in the driveway!

04:06.988 --> 04:08.154
Welcome back, Remi.

04:08.156 --> 04:10.518
It is good to have you home.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.017
Doesn't he look wonderful?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.718
Isn't he just
movie star handsome?

04:14.720 --> 04:16.418
Oh, for Pete's sake, Genevieve,

04:16.420 --> 04:17.716
You're embarrassing the boy.

04:17.719 --> 04:19.850
I just want him to know
how proud we are.

04:19.851 --> 04:21.449
Well, I think he gets it.

04:21.451 --> 04:24.383
Remi, there's someone else
waiting to see you.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.444
You saved my life.

04:41.446 --> 04:43.544
Thank you.

05:00.700 --> 05:04.570
So... I hear you talked
to Flora's grandmother.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.442
We had a nice, long talk.

05:06.444 --> 05:07.680
Did she tell you anything
useful?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.452
As a matter of fact...

05:09.454 --> 05:13.434
She told me that Flora
was seeing one of your friends.

05:13.436 --> 05:15.040
What?

05:15.042 --> 05:17.114
It was <i>his</i> child
that she was expecting.

05:18.622 --> 05:19.790
no way.

05:19.792 --> 05:22.600
We know this is hard.
It's impossible.

05:22.602 --> 05:25.110
Flora never met
any of my friends.

05:25.112 --> 05:26.281
Are you sure?

05:26.283 --> 05:27.685
I never introduced Flora
to anyone.

05:27.687 --> 05:29.693
We didn't even go out
that much.

05:29.695 --> 05:33.104
The only party we were at
together was the...

05:33.106 --> 05:35.581
Eddie, what is it?

05:37.590 --> 05:39.192
I can't tell you.

05:39.194 --> 05:41.602
I think we're past the point

05:41.604 --> 05:43.542
Where you're allowed
to be embarrassed.

05:45.483 --> 05:46.888
I'll tell <i>her.</i>

05:48.360 --> 05:50.167
Not you.

05:50.169 --> 05:52.607
Eddie, come on! Mom!

05:52.609 --> 05:54.916
I'm not talking to you
about this, okay?

05:54.918 --> 05:57.860
It's okay.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.438
Well, don't just sit there.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.984
Tell me what you've done.

06:15.524 --> 06:17.865
Yes, excellent.
Thank you so much.

06:17.867 --> 06:18.968
Yes, bye.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.307
Hey, good news!

06:20.309 --> 06:21.878
Odessa's test results
came back.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.485
She's doing much better.

06:23.487 --> 06:24.956
Fantastic!

06:24.958 --> 06:26.360
When is she coming home?

06:26.362 --> 06:27.566
They're keeping her
at the hospital

06:27.568 --> 06:30.375
For two more weeks,
just to be sure.

06:30.377 --> 06:31.815
Oh.

06:31.817 --> 06:33.654
What's wrong?

06:33.656 --> 06:37.335
Nothing. I was just hoping
she'd be back sooner than that.

06:37.337 --> 06:39.074
If there's something you need,
I can do it.

06:39.076 --> 06:40.579
Thanks.

06:40.581 --> 06:41.850
There are certain things
Odessa does for me

06:41.852 --> 06:44.894
That I don't trust
anyone else to do.

06:44.896 --> 06:46.032
Oh.

06:46.034 --> 06:47.738
Well, like what?

06:47.740 --> 06:48.808
You know...

06:48.810 --> 06:51.150
Intimate stuff.

06:51.152 --> 06:52.622
Intimate?

06:52.624 --> 06:54.998
What does that mean?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.439
Odessa...

06:57.441 --> 06:59.814
Shaves me.

06:59.816 --> 07:01.687
Huh?

07:01.689 --> 07:04.497
Well,
I can get... Pretty hairy.

07:04.499 --> 07:05.602
I hate waxing.

07:05.604 --> 07:08.479
So... Odessa shaves me.

07:08.481 --> 07:10.887
Hell, I can do that. Really?

07:10.889 --> 07:13.028
You wouldn't mind? No, no, no!

07:13.030 --> 07:15.136
I might even enjoy it.

07:15.138 --> 07:16.608
This is great. Okay.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.547
'Cause I got a date
tomorrow night,

07:18.549 --> 07:20.756
And I'm in need
of some serious grooming.

07:20.758 --> 07:22.662
Oh, that's
just a little stubble.

07:22.664 --> 07:24.670
I'll take care of it
in the morning.

07:24.672 --> 07:25.740
Uh, Carmen?

07:25.742 --> 07:27.580
I shave my own chest.

07:27.582 --> 07:29.563
I need you to do my back.

07:36.186 --> 07:37.924
oh, no.

07:37.926 --> 07:40.219
So he asked you
to shave his back?

07:40.221 --> 07:41.652
That's right.

07:41.653 --> 07:43.149
Just how much hair
are we talking?

07:43.151 --> 07:46.010
If you cross a werewolf
with a Kardashian.

07:46.012 --> 07:47.041
Oh, my God.

07:47.043 --> 07:48.872
So are you gonna do it?

07:48.874 --> 07:51.003
I don't want to,
but do I have a choice?

07:51.005 --> 07:52.133
Is there a polite way

07:52.135 --> 07:53.965
To tell your boss
he's deformed?

07:53.967 --> 07:56.893
I once worked for
this 80-year-old lesbian.

07:56.895 --> 07:58.957
She asked me to give her
a bikini wax.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.887
I will give you $10 to stop this
story right now.

08:00.889 --> 08:02.850
I was so nervous.

08:02.852 --> 08:05.118
I dripped the wax onto her...

08:06.685 --> 08:07.813
Did she fire you?

08:07.815 --> 08:10.735
Hmm? She offered me a raise.

08:10.737 --> 08:12.928
That's weird, right?

08:12.930 --> 08:15.950
hey...

08:15.952 --> 08:19.439
What are you guys doing here?
Wanted to come say hi.

08:19.441 --> 08:21.639
This is Remi Delatour, the boy
I've been telling you about.

08:21.641 --> 08:23.705
<i>Hola.  nice to meet you guys.
I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

08:23.707 --> 08:26.705
I just need to speak
with Zoila for a moment.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.638
<i>oh. Okay.</i>

08:29.641 --> 08:31.371
Excuse us.

08:31.373 --> 08:34.438
he's so cute.

08:36.005 --> 08:38.570
Rosie's story gave me an idea
on how to handle Alejandro.

08:38.572 --> 08:41.972
You think I should
pour wax on his...

08:41.972 --> 08:43.038
You know?

08:43.039 --> 08:44.471
No.

08:44.473 --> 08:46.671
Tell him you'd be
happy to shave his back.

08:46.673 --> 08:50.771
But say you need a little bump
in your salary first.

08:50.773 --> 08:52.770
And then ask for a raise
that's so big...

08:52.772 --> 08:56.096
It'll make the hair on his back
stand on end.

08:59.047 --> 09:01.501
So?

09:01.502 --> 09:03.671
What's on your mind?

09:03.673 --> 09:09.263
I would very much like
to start dating your daughter.

09:09.265 --> 09:11.236
Oh.

09:11.238 --> 09:12.913
But I know you might have
some reservations

09:12.915 --> 09:14.854
Because I was...

09:14.855 --> 09:16.202
Doing drugs?

09:16.203 --> 09:17.715
Yeah.

09:17.717 --> 09:19.688
I-I just thought that,

09:19.690 --> 09:21.727
You know, I should get
your permission first.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.108
Well, if you really want
permission,

09:23.109 --> 09:24.621
You should talk to her father.

09:24.623 --> 09:25.740
Okay.

09:25.742 --> 09:29.160
Um, does he know that I was...

09:29.161 --> 09:30.246
Doing drugs?

09:30.248 --> 09:31.595
Yeah.

09:31.597 --> 09:34.587
I may have mentioned it.
He'll wanna meet you.

09:34.588 --> 09:36.461
Can you come to the house
for dinner?

09:36.462 --> 09:38.303
I'd... I'd love to.

09:38.304 --> 09:39.980
Good.

09:39.982 --> 09:43.038
Oh, and this whole
asking permission thing

09:43.040 --> 09:45.736
Is really... Classy?

09:45.738 --> 09:47.875
Smart.

10:00.982 --> 10:03.154
Mmm.

10:04.359 --> 10:06.262
Hello, Rosie.

10:06.264 --> 10:08.169
What are you doing here?

10:08.171 --> 10:09.539
Are you shopping?

10:09.541 --> 10:12.013
In a manner of speaking.

10:12.015 --> 10:13.952
Oh.

10:15.089 --> 10:18.364
I wanted to invite you to a party.

10:18.366 --> 10:20.169
A party?

10:20.172 --> 10:22.043
You sound surprised.

10:22.045 --> 10:24.416
Oh, rich people don't
invite me to parties.

10:24.418 --> 10:26.923
Well, they would
if they knew you like I do.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.196
You don't know me so much.

10:29.199 --> 10:31.904
I know enough to be...

10:31.906 --> 10:34.346
Fascinated.

10:36.086 --> 10:39.092
I don't have nothing
to wear to a party.

10:39.094 --> 10:41.098
Then I'll give you some money.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.369
What?

10:42.371 --> 10:44.108
So you could buy a gown.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.383
And I'll make sure
there's a... Little left over.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.262
You make me uncomfortable.

10:52.936 --> 10:55.373
That's because you're sensing
my hidden agenda.

10:55.375 --> 10:58.149
I don't know what that is,
but don't take it out.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.686
A friend of mine
is coming to this party,

10:59.688 --> 11:01.291
And he's been
a little down lately.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.133
And I thought you could
meet him and...

11:04.135 --> 11:06.038
Entertain him.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.980
Entertain him?

11:08.982 --> 11:12.623
Oh, Rosie,
you're so delightfully naive.

11:12.626 --> 11:15.869
but we both know
you're not stupid.

11:41.398 --> 11:44.907
Hi, Ida. It's marisol... Again.

11:44.910 --> 11:48.108
I need you to call me
and tell me what Eddie said.

11:48.110 --> 11:50.647
Surely it can't be that bad.

11:50.649 --> 11:52.822
And if it is...

11:52.824 --> 11:54.671
Just call me, okay?

11:56.749 --> 11:58.100
Michael!

11:58.102 --> 12:00.803
Michael! Is something wrong?

12:00.806 --> 12:04.432
No, no. Everything is right...
absolutely, wonderfully right.

12:04.435 --> 12:06.444
Michael, get out here!

12:06.447 --> 12:08.391
What's going on?

12:10.798 --> 12:12.809
Mm.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.643
I'm pregnant.

12:15.646 --> 12:16.997
oh!

12:16.999 --> 12:19.339
oh! Oh!

12:19.340 --> 12:21.285
When did you find out?

12:21.288 --> 12:23.262
I took an E.P.T. Test
yesterday.

12:23.265 --> 12:24.516
But I wasn't sure.

12:24.518 --> 12:26.626
So I made an appointment
with Dr. Kagan.

12:26.628 --> 12:27.846
And we ran some tests.

12:27.849 --> 12:29.429
We're gonna have a baby!

12:29.431 --> 12:31.476
And we're gonna have a baby!

12:31.477 --> 12:33.717
mwah!
Congratulations, you two.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.828
I am so happy for you.

12:35.830 --> 12:38.136
So who are we gonna call first?

12:38.138 --> 12:39.719
Your mother or my sister?

12:39.721 --> 12:42.059
Well, uh, I don't think
we should tell anyone just yet.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.478
He's right.

12:43.481 --> 12:45.688
It's better to wait
a few weeks just in case.

12:45.691 --> 12:48.392
But I have to tell somebody.

12:48.394 --> 12:50.536
I know. I'll call Kate ebley.

12:50.538 --> 12:52.251
Uh, Taylor.

12:52.253 --> 12:54.295
I was the first person
she called

12:54.298 --> 12:57.033
When she found Peter in bed
with that jockey.

12:57.035 --> 12:59.886
I owe her one.

13:04.602 --> 13:07.297
I really wouldn't
worry about it too much.

13:07.299 --> 13:08.793
Taylor is healthy.

13:08.795 --> 13:10.841
She's got the best doctors
in the world.

13:10.843 --> 13:12.954
I'm not worried about that.

13:12.957 --> 13:15.196
Kate ebley has a big mouth.

13:15.199 --> 13:17.018
You're worried
Olivia might hear.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.123
Yeah.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.683
She's gonna find out
eventually.

13:19.685 --> 13:21.600
I know.

13:21.603 --> 13:23.129
But I should be the one
to tell her.

13:23.131 --> 13:24.494
You're divorced.

13:24.495 --> 13:26.379
You don't owe her anything.

13:26.381 --> 13:27.971
We were married 21 years.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.374
I owe her some dignity.

13:33.948 --> 13:36.937
Adrian Powell
propositioned you?

13:36.939 --> 13:39.969
In the supermarket parking lot.

13:39.970 --> 13:41.452
What exactly did he say?

13:41.453 --> 13:43.371
He invited me to a party,

13:43.373 --> 13:46.304
And then he offered
to buy me a dress.

13:46.307 --> 13:49.470
Well, that's awful.

13:49.471 --> 13:51.054
So...

13:51.056 --> 13:55.401
When did he tell you
he wanted to have sex?

13:55.403 --> 13:57.693
Well, he never actually
said that.

13:57.694 --> 14:00.052
But his eyes did.

14:00.053 --> 14:02.612
And so did his finger.

14:02.614 --> 14:04.500
His finger? Mm-hmm.

14:04.502 --> 14:07.094
He went like this.

14:09.353 --> 14:12.251
And I know what
that finger was saying.

14:12.252 --> 14:16.326
Sweetheart, I'm so sorry
you had to go through that.

14:16.328 --> 14:18.483
The guy's obviously a creep.
 yeah.

14:18.485 --> 14:20.606
The good news is it's over.

14:20.608 --> 14:23.808
You never have to talk
to him again.

14:23.810 --> 14:25.459
That's it?

14:25.461 --> 14:26.739
Huh?

14:26.741 --> 14:28.457
You're not going to his house?

14:28.459 --> 14:29.906
Why would I do that?

14:29.908 --> 14:31.423
So you could punch him
or kick him

14:31.426 --> 14:33.951
Or hit him with a stick.

14:33.953 --> 14:36.442
Well, you're serious.

14:36.444 --> 14:38.936
He insulted me.

14:38.938 --> 14:42.779
Yes. He made
an indecent proposal.

14:44.599 --> 14:46.551
This town is full of those.

14:46.554 --> 14:48.742
It's nothing to freak out over.

14:50.936 --> 14:53.561
Mrs. Peri's right.

14:53.563 --> 14:55.179
About what?

14:55.181 --> 14:56.897
You're a wuss.

14:56.899 --> 14:58.213
Excuse me? Yeah.

14:58.214 --> 14:59.695
You're afraid to fight.

14:59.696 --> 15:01.380
It's okay.

15:01.382 --> 15:03.435
Not every man can do that.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.883
<i>Hey.</i>

15:04.886 --> 15:07.140
Hey, I am not afraid to fight.
Mm.

15:07.143 --> 15:08.861
But I don't need
to pounce some perv

15:08.863 --> 15:12.432
Just to prove how macho I am.

15:12.434 --> 15:16.138
Ernesto would have hit him.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.835
But that's because
I belonged to him.

15:18.837 --> 15:22.135
It was his job to protect me.

15:22.137 --> 15:24.486
I forget.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.703
I do not belong to you.

15:36.372 --> 15:37.535
So why haven't you
called me back?

15:38.882 --> 15:41.162
This is not the kind of news
you deliver over the phone.

15:41.164 --> 15:43.343
So Eddie said
you could tell me?

15:43.345 --> 15:44.650
It's okay?

15:44.653 --> 15:46.194
Yeah.

15:46.197 --> 15:48.040
He just didn't want
to be there when you found out.

15:48.042 --> 15:51.325
That doesn't sound good.

15:54.112 --> 15:56.726
Flora never met any friends
of Eddie's.

15:56.727 --> 16:00.886
But he remembers that
she met some of his clients.

16:00.888 --> 16:02.430
Clients?

16:02.432 --> 16:05.382
Eddie had a small business.

16:05.384 --> 16:08.199
He never mentioned that to me.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.076
No, he wouldn't have.

16:12.259 --> 16:15.812
What kind of business
are we talking about exactly?

16:15.814 --> 16:20.307
Your son has supported himself
for the last two years

16:20.309 --> 16:22.018
By selling drugs.

16:22.019 --> 16:25.540
He had a partner...
somebody named Brad...

16:25.541 --> 16:28.456
Who was a coworker
at Beverly cuisine catering.

16:28.459 --> 16:29.901
They sold to the guests

16:29.903 --> 16:31.914
At the swanky parties
they worked.

16:36.243 --> 16:40.366
Anyway, Eddie says
Flora met some of his buys.

16:40.368 --> 16:43.419
He thinks
Brad can tell us more.

16:46.204 --> 16:48.384
Did Eddie murder Flora?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.669
You know he didn't.

16:51.672 --> 16:54.655
A minute ago, I knew my son
would never be a drug dealer,

16:54.657 --> 16:57.809
But I was wrong.

16:57.811 --> 17:00.224
What else am I wrong about?

17:00.225 --> 17:02.471
I know you're disappointed
and upset.

17:02.472 --> 17:04.517
But you can't give up on Eddie.

17:04.519 --> 17:06.160
Not now.

17:06.162 --> 17:08.709
Not when we're so close
to finding out the truth.

17:08.711 --> 17:12.467
So...

17:12.468 --> 17:15.351
What do we do now?

17:15.353 --> 17:17.767
I got a hold of the people
at the catering company.

17:17.769 --> 17:20.449
They gave me Brad's cell,
but he won't return my calls.

17:21.559 --> 17:23.569
Don't worry.

17:23.570 --> 17:26.957
I will find this punk.

17:26.959 --> 17:29.304
hey.

17:29.307 --> 17:31.451
I'll be talking
to Eddie tonight.

17:31.453 --> 17:34.639
Any message for him?

17:34.641 --> 17:36.585
Tell him I love him.

17:38.464 --> 17:40.779
But I won't be able
to see him for a while.

17:52.938 --> 17:55.222
hi.

17:55.223 --> 17:56.522
Hi.

17:56.523 --> 17:59.522
so before we go in,

17:59.524 --> 18:01.105
I wanted to warn you about something.
What's that?

18:01.107 --> 18:03.842
My dad has
a weird sense of humor.

18:03.843 --> 18:06.280
Everybody's dad
has a weird sense of humor.

18:06.283 --> 18:09.412
No. Most people's fathers
say stuff that's dumb or silly.

18:09.413 --> 18:10.928
My dad's jokes are sort of...

18:10.930 --> 18:13.599
Offensive.

18:13.601 --> 18:14.883
I'm sure he'll be fine.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.478
There you are! Hey, <i>papi.</i>

18:18.479 --> 18:20.588
I want you to meet Remi.
Remi, this is my dad.

18:20.589 --> 18:22.203
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

18:22.205 --> 18:24.543
I brought you a little something.
<i>Oh.</i>

18:24.544 --> 18:29.390
Zoila! The drug addict
brought me scotch!

18:29.392 --> 18:31.466
oh! Come on!

18:31.467 --> 18:33.346
You thought that was funny,
right?

18:33.348 --> 18:34.565
You know what?

18:34.567 --> 18:36.014
If you can laugh
at the stupid mistakes

18:36.016 --> 18:37.959
I've made in my life,
well, then...

18:37.962 --> 18:39.379
I guess I can, too.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.190
I like this kid.

18:41.191 --> 18:43.894
You got a little, uh,
powder right there.

18:46.073 --> 18:48.905
<i>Mami! Okay. Okay.</i>

18:48.906 --> 18:51.147
Let's not bring her into this.
I'll behave.

18:51.149 --> 18:54.806
It's an honor to welcome you
to our home, Remi Delatour.

18:54.809 --> 18:57.342
And I'm honored to be here,
mister...

18:59.323 --> 19:00.937
Oh, my God. This is so awkward.

19:00.938 --> 19:02.091
I just realized,

19:02.092 --> 19:03.706
I don't even know
your last name.

19:03.708 --> 19:05.192
It's Diaz.

19:05.194 --> 19:07.926
Right. I'm so sorry, Mr. Diaz.
 I get it.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.311
My wife and daughter
work for you.

19:09.312 --> 19:10.927
You call them
by their first names.

19:10.928 --> 19:12.145
Exactly.

19:12.147 --> 19:13.596
God, I really hope
I didn't offend you.

19:13.598 --> 19:14.947
no! Relax.

19:14.950 --> 19:18.231
We're all friends here.
Nobody's offended.

19:21.592 --> 19:23.716
Hey, Carmen. Got a sec?

19:23.718 --> 19:24.656
Sure.

19:24.658 --> 19:26.399
You need something?

19:26.400 --> 19:29.349
I believe we had
an appointment?

19:29.350 --> 19:30.656
Right.

19:30.659 --> 19:32.667
You know...

19:32.668 --> 19:35.483
Shaving isn't really
in my job description.

19:35.485 --> 19:37.026
So if want me to do this,

19:37.027 --> 19:40.644
I feel I... Deserve a raise.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.750
Like what?

19:41.753 --> 19:42.958
$50 a week?

19:42.960 --> 19:44.869
$250.

19:44.871 --> 19:46.744
But if you'd rather
go to a salon,

19:46.747 --> 19:48.420
I will totally... you got it.

19:48.423 --> 19:49.930
<i>What?</i>

19:49.932 --> 19:52.007
You got your raise. Let's go.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.874
You know what?

20:03.875 --> 20:07.462
I'm gonna need
some alcohol first.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.751
Disinfecting the razor?

20:11.753 --> 20:13.863
Yeah. Sure.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.836
okay. Let's do this.

20:20.837 --> 20:23.282
here you go.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.193
mm.

20:32.768 --> 20:33.908
Careful.

20:33.910 --> 20:35.920
You don't want to put too much.

20:35.921 --> 20:38.735
Not possible.

20:42.224 --> 20:44.097
okay.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.165
ow!

20:50.167 --> 20:51.472
I'm sorry!

20:51.474 --> 20:54.288
You cut me. I know.
And I feel so bad.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.265
Why would you do that?

20:56.267 --> 20:58.849
I sort of had my eyes closed.

20:58.851 --> 21:00.389
Why?

21:02.031 --> 21:03.305
For me...

21:03.307 --> 21:06.959
And this is just my opinion...

21:06.960 --> 21:10.211
Back hair is nasty.

21:13.429 --> 21:16.278
Oh.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.510
Again, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

21:22.874 --> 21:25.410
Have dinner with me.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.393
now why
would I want to do that?

21:28.396 --> 21:30.098
Well, I can promise you
good food,

21:30.099 --> 21:33.307
Good conversation.
I'll make you laugh.

21:33.310 --> 21:35.176
I might even tell you
I'm sorry for the way

21:35.178 --> 21:37.897
I cheated on you
during our marriage.

21:37.899 --> 21:40.189
If you tell me that,
I <i>will</i> laugh.

21:40.191 --> 21:41.665
It's true, though.

21:41.666 --> 21:45.138
Phillipe Delatour,
what are you up to?

21:45.141 --> 21:48.741
Uh, these last few days, uh...

21:48.743 --> 21:50.937
Have just got me thinking.

21:50.939 --> 21:54.705
I wish I had been
a better father to Remi,

21:54.707 --> 21:56.801
A better husband to you.

21:56.803 --> 21:59.651
Oh.

21:59.653 --> 22:01.323
So what do you say?

22:01.325 --> 22:03.716
I'll take you out for a steak

22:03.718 --> 22:07.253
And a ridiculously expensive
bottle of wine.

22:07.255 --> 22:09.058
you're gonna get me drunk

22:09.059 --> 22:10.432
And make a pass at me?

22:10.434 --> 22:12.431
Well, not if it would
insult you.

22:12.433 --> 22:14.395
It would insult me
if you didn't.

22:14.397 --> 22:16.232
So you'll go?

22:16.233 --> 22:19.049
I adore you, Phillipe.

22:19.051 --> 22:21.900
But I'm not some toy
you can play with

22:21.902 --> 22:24.193
Anytime you feel lonely.

22:24.196 --> 22:28.158
And just because
I've forgiven you for the past,

22:28.160 --> 22:30.321
Doesn't mean I've forgotten.

22:30.323 --> 22:34.745
So we'll go out and just
talk about the past...

22:34.747 --> 22:36.285
Like old friends.

22:36.287 --> 22:39.135
All right.

22:39.137 --> 22:40.643
But just so we're clear,

22:40.644 --> 22:42.839
If you stare
at a pretty waitress

22:42.840 --> 22:44.672
While I'm speaking,

22:44.675 --> 22:48.537
I will stab you in your neck
with my fork.

22:50.866 --> 22:52.602
Well, I promise.

22:52.603 --> 22:54.864
I will only have eyes for you.

23:05.745 --> 23:07.509
Michael?

23:07.512 --> 23:10.617
Sorry for just dropping in.

23:10.619 --> 23:14.253
It's fine. Sit. Sit.

23:15.776 --> 23:17.362
Oh.

23:17.364 --> 23:19.279
Well, this is nice.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.188
It's a silk rope tieback
for some drapes I'm doing.

23:22.191 --> 23:25.329
I was gonna redo our drapes
with something like that.

23:25.330 --> 23:27.544
But then you left.

23:27.545 --> 23:30.354
Yeah. Well...

23:30.356 --> 23:33.194
So... It's so good to see you.

23:34.290 --> 23:36.338
I hope Taylor's doing well...

23:36.339 --> 23:38.948
She said, insincerely.

23:38.950 --> 23:41.528
well, Taylor is fine. No.

23:41.530 --> 23:44.205
She's more than fine, actually.

23:44.207 --> 23:45.925
Oh?

23:48.042 --> 23:51.478
Taylor and I
are going to have a baby.

23:54.323 --> 23:58.420
I thought you should
hear it from me.

23:58.422 --> 24:01.924
I know this must be upsetting.

24:01.925 --> 24:05.992
Only because I couldn't
give you children.

24:05.994 --> 24:09.329
I know that's
all you ever wanted.

24:09.331 --> 24:12.371
Not <i>.</i>

24:16.571 --> 24:18.884
So...

24:18.886 --> 24:20.537
Are you happy?

24:20.539 --> 24:21.661
Yes.

24:21.664 --> 24:22.918
Well, good.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.165
Because that's all
<i>I</i> ever wanted.

24:25.167 --> 24:28.504
That's a nice thing to say.

24:28.506 --> 24:30.090
I mean that.

24:30.092 --> 24:32.537
You must know I still love you.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.123
I do.

24:36.968 --> 24:40.041
And I think it's time
you stopped.

24:41.959 --> 24:44.340
I wish I knew how.

24:52.639 --> 24:54.687
Are you...

24:54.689 --> 24:57.661
Going to be okay?

24:57.663 --> 24:58.654
Oh...

24:58.656 --> 25:00.836
My sweet Michael.

25:00.837 --> 25:04.703
You shouldn't worry about me.

25:04.705 --> 25:07.927
I am no longer your problem.

25:20.790 --> 25:24.646
So... This is delicious.

25:24.649 --> 25:25.842
What do you call it?

25:25.844 --> 25:27.405
Stuffed peppers.
Valentina made them.

25:27.407 --> 25:28.569
Really?

25:28.571 --> 25:30.495
You know how to stuff peppers?

25:30.497 --> 25:32.190
It's Mexican food.

25:32.192 --> 25:35.846
I'm Mexican, or did you
not know that either?

25:40.334 --> 25:44.288
so, Remi...

25:44.290 --> 25:47.446
Did you ever try heroin?

25:47.448 --> 25:48.642
Pablo!

25:48.644 --> 25:50.736
I'm trying to break
the tension.

25:50.738 --> 25:52.732
By talking about heroin?

25:52.734 --> 25:54.791
Fine. You do the small talk.

25:56.388 --> 26:00.009
So it is really nice
to finally have you over, Remi.

26:00.011 --> 26:01.271
It's my pleasure.

26:01.273 --> 26:03.002
It's a wonderful house.

26:03.005 --> 26:04.695
It's cozy, but we like it.

26:04.696 --> 26:06.990
So is it just
the three of you here?

26:08.022 --> 26:09.614
Who else would be here?

26:09.617 --> 26:12.406
Well, I wasn't sure if maybe you
had... brothers and sisters?

26:12.409 --> 26:15.398
You think I have
brothers and sisters?

26:15.400 --> 26:18.157
I'm guessing... You don't?

26:18.159 --> 26:21.115
Why do you have to guess?
You should <i>know.</i>

26:21.117 --> 26:23.607
<i>Valentina. I know
everything about him.</i>

26:23.609 --> 26:25.568
I know what
his favorite movies are,

26:25.571 --> 26:27.096
What he likes for breakfast,

26:27.098 --> 26:28.427
What kind of shaving cream
he uses.

26:28.429 --> 26:31.220
How can you not know
my last name is Diaz?

26:31.222 --> 26:34.608
How is that possible?

26:43.254 --> 26:46.108
I bet you wish you had
some heroin right now, huh?

26:53.954 --> 26:55.914
<i>we're sorry.</i>

26:55.916 --> 26:57.209
<i>The mailbox of the subscriber</i>
<i>you're trying to reach is full.</i>

27:06.217 --> 27:08.046
Where have you been?

27:08.048 --> 27:10.571
My friend Celia took me shopping
for baby clothes.

27:10.574 --> 27:13.164
You told Celia? Taylor!

27:13.166 --> 27:16.853
I was the first person she told
about her lap-band surgery.

27:16.855 --> 27:18.282
I totally owed her.

27:18.284 --> 27:21.406
Well, can you just not tell
anyone else, please...

27:21.408 --> 27:23.534
At least for a few weeks? Fine.

27:23.535 --> 27:26.259
So how cute are these?

27:26.261 --> 27:28.352
Adorable.

27:28.354 --> 27:31.244
Did you get everything in blue?

27:31.246 --> 27:32.408
It's gonna be a boy.

27:32.409 --> 27:34.235
How do you know that?
I just do.

27:34.238 --> 27:35.831
okay.

27:35.834 --> 27:38.356
I also know he's going
to be smart and talented

27:38.358 --> 27:41.016
And funny and full of mischief.

27:41.018 --> 27:45.802
And I will love him
more than anyone in the world.

27:45.804 --> 27:47.929
What's wrong?

27:47.932 --> 27:52.184
I was just thinking
about a woman I know

27:52.186 --> 27:53.979
Who has a son.

27:53.982 --> 27:59.131
And she thought that she knew
exactly how he would turn out.

27:59.133 --> 28:02.288
But... She was wrong.

28:03.918 --> 28:05.876
Well, I don't really care
what my son is like,

28:05.878 --> 28:08.070
As long as he shows up.

28:08.072 --> 28:09.933
Now I'm gonna show you
the blanket I bought.

28:09.934 --> 28:12.990
It is beyond precious.

28:18.108 --> 28:21.199
Okay...

28:21.200 --> 28:23.891
<i>oh.</i>

28:23.893 --> 28:25.786
you know...

28:25.789 --> 28:29.808
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to
tell people you were pregnant.

28:29.810 --> 28:32.069
You think? Just a few.

28:32.070 --> 28:34.195
And you could tell 'em
at the same time.

28:34.196 --> 28:36.621
Do something fun,
like have a dinner party.

28:36.622 --> 28:37.751
That'd be wonderful.

28:37.753 --> 28:38.980
And you'd make
something special?

28:38.983 --> 28:40.776
No, this is your first baby.

28:40.778 --> 28:42.237
You gotta do it right.

28:42.239 --> 28:43.700
Meaning?

28:43.702 --> 28:46.592
Hire a catering company.

28:54.138 --> 28:55.799
Did Remi leave?

28:55.801 --> 28:56.995
What choice did he have?

28:56.997 --> 28:58.892
Your father kept asking him

28:58.893 --> 29:01.683
If he wanted to watch
"trainspotting."

29:01.684 --> 29:04.972
I'm sorry I freaked out
and ruined the dinner.

29:04.974 --> 29:08.828
Just because Remi doesn't know
you're "Valentina Diaz"

29:08.830 --> 29:10.988
Doesn't mean he isn't
crazy about you.

29:10.990 --> 29:13.049
I know. It's just,

29:13.052 --> 29:16.107
I worry he never bothered to learn
my last name...

29:16.109 --> 29:18.633
Because...

29:18.634 --> 29:21.656
He still
thinks of me as the help.

29:21.658 --> 29:24.916
Come on. Well, why wouldn't he?

29:24.918 --> 29:26.444
Most of the time
when he sees me,

29:26.445 --> 29:30.166
I'm making his bed,
washing his socks,

29:30.168 --> 29:32.692
Pouring milk on his cereal.

29:35.484 --> 29:39.437
Are you ready for an obvious
solution to this problem?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.931
I guess. Quit.

29:44.790 --> 29:46.718
Quit?

29:46.720 --> 29:47.947
He won't think of you
as the help

29:47.949 --> 29:49.344
If you don't
hang around his house

29:49.346 --> 29:50.907
Helping him all the time.

29:57.951 --> 29:59.613
Are you... Sure?

29:59.615 --> 30:01.938
You're starting school
in the fall anyway.

30:01.941 --> 30:04.000
I think it's great.

30:04.002 --> 30:07.822
Thank you, <i>mami.</i>

30:09.520 --> 30:10.980
What's so funny?

30:10.982 --> 30:12.842
I was just thinking,

30:12.843 --> 30:14.769
If you and Remi end up
getting married,

30:14.771 --> 30:16.531
You'd spend the rest
of your life

30:16.532 --> 30:18.358
Fixing his room,
washing his socks,

30:18.361 --> 30:19.722
Pouring milk on his cereal.

30:19.724 --> 30:21.384
But then I'll be his wife,

30:21.385 --> 30:24.010
And he won't think of me
as the help.

30:24.011 --> 30:27.333
You know nothing
about marriage.

30:32.452 --> 30:34.812
<i>For the last time, Dalton.</i>

30:34.814 --> 30:36.506
<i>Jenny's with me now.</i>

30:36.509 --> 30:38.833
<i>She's a drunk. She doesn't</i>
<i>know what she wants.</i>

30:38.835 --> 30:40.394
<i>I think you'd better leave.</i>

30:40.397 --> 30:41.692
<i>You don't wanna be</i>
<i>with me, Jenny?</i>

30:41.694 --> 30:44.550
<i>No problem. You pathetic tramp.</i>

30:44.552 --> 30:46.409
<i>You wanna meet someone?</i>

30:46.412 --> 30:48.372
<i>Meet... My... Fist.</i>

31:10.675 --> 31:12.601
Hello, Mr. Powell.

31:12.603 --> 31:14.230
I don't know
if you remember me.

31:14.232 --> 31:15.593
Well, of course I do, Spence.

31:15.595 --> 31:17.388
We met last year
at that, uh, charity dinner.

31:17.390 --> 31:20.113
Yeah. It was for burn victims.
Right.

31:20.115 --> 31:22.339
They, uh, served barbecue.

31:22.341 --> 31:24.666
No one got the irony but me.

31:24.668 --> 31:28.621
Mr. Powell, I'm here to
talk to you about Rosie falta.

31:28.624 --> 31:30.782
Ah, such a lovely woman.
I'm a little angry at her.

31:30.785 --> 31:33.274
Angry? Well, she left this
house without notice.

31:33.276 --> 31:36.332
You know how hard it is
to find attractive help?

31:37.794 --> 31:40.587
Look what I'm reduced to.

31:40.589 --> 31:42.614
This hulking mass is Olga.

31:42.616 --> 31:46.602
She won a bronze medal
for Bulgaria in the shot put.

31:46.604 --> 31:48.198
She now works here

31:48.200 --> 31:51.023
And eats me
out of house and home.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.141
What'd she say?

31:56.143 --> 31:58.035
Must be time for her feeding.

31:58.037 --> 31:59.665
you keep cleaning.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.227
I'll get you some meat.

32:04.383 --> 32:05.714
Look, about Rosie...

32:05.716 --> 32:07.044
What about her?

32:07.047 --> 32:08.705
She says you insulted her.

32:08.708 --> 32:11.263
That doesn't sound like me.

32:11.265 --> 32:12.993
Do you deny propositioning her?

32:12.995 --> 32:15.086
I discussed some business, yes.

32:15.088 --> 32:16.450
Business?

32:16.452 --> 32:19.972
Did you or did you not
offer her money for sex?

32:19.974 --> 32:22.530
You know what I hate?

32:22.533 --> 32:24.260
Hypocrites.

32:24.262 --> 32:25.356
What?

32:25.358 --> 32:26.652
You're having sex
with her, right?

32:26.654 --> 32:28.347
That's beside the point.

32:28.349 --> 32:29.977
No, it's not.

32:29.979 --> 32:31.340
I admit I wanna take
a bite off the same apple

32:31.342 --> 32:33.498
You're nibbling on.

32:33.501 --> 32:37.386
What's so wrong about offering
to pay top dollar for it?

32:39.218 --> 32:41.077
There's someone I want you
to meet, Adrian.

32:41.079 --> 32:43.171
Who's that? My fist.

32:43.173 --> 32:45.034
uhh.

32:59.492 --> 33:01.550
Could I talk to you?

33:01.553 --> 33:04.043
My date's gonna be here
any minute.

33:04.045 --> 33:06.271
This will take
just two seconds.

33:08.831 --> 33:11.953
I obviously hurt
your feelings yesterday,

33:11.956 --> 33:13.483
And I didn't mean to.

33:13.485 --> 33:15.975
You said that I could
trust you.

33:15.977 --> 33:18.204
So I exposed a part of myself...

33:18.206 --> 33:20.364
Something I'm embarrassed by...

33:20.366 --> 33:21.892
And you insulted me.

33:21.894 --> 33:23.953
And I am so sorry.

33:23.956 --> 33:25.282
Am I such a scary boss

33:25.284 --> 33:26.746
That you feel like you can't
even say "no" to me?

33:26.748 --> 33:27.909
<i>No.</i>

33:27.911 --> 33:29.335
No, no. You're terrific.

33:29.337 --> 33:31.398
And I wanted to help you,
but I-I...

33:31.400 --> 33:33.991
I couldn't,
because I'm immature

33:33.992 --> 33:35.785
And silly and...

33:37.381 --> 33:39.075
I'm sorry.

33:41.270 --> 33:42.898
Apology accepted.

33:44.163 --> 33:45.889
I'm glad you think
I'm terrific.

33:45.892 --> 33:47.085
Oh, I do.

33:47.088 --> 33:49.146
And now that I've gotten
to know you,

33:49.148 --> 33:51.339
I-I think you're amazing,
and I like you so very much.

33:51.341 --> 33:52.737
Ah.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.260
So you didn't like me
at first? Huh?

33:55.262 --> 33:56.691
I couldn't tell.

33:56.693 --> 34:00.381
You don't really let...
People in.

34:00.383 --> 34:02.076
That's true.

34:03.971 --> 34:06.762
Why is that?

34:06.764 --> 34:10.219
I've trusted a lot of people
over the years,

34:10.219 --> 34:11.947
And, um...

34:11.949 --> 34:15.172
So many of them
have betrayed me.

34:16.333 --> 34:20.322
So I keep the walls up
just to be safe.

34:20.324 --> 34:24.676
I get not wanting
to show people your back.

34:24.677 --> 34:27.833
But you shouldn't be afraid
to show people your soul.

34:27.835 --> 34:30.626
You're right. I shouldn't.

34:30.628 --> 34:32.255
Well, just know...

34:32.257 --> 34:33.917
You can trust me.

34:33.918 --> 34:36.973
You can be open with me
and tell me what's going on,

34:36.976 --> 34:41.694
And I will never, <i>ever</i>
<i>betray you, okay?</i>

34:45.253 --> 34:47.244
My date is here.

34:47.246 --> 34:49.737
Well... Have a nice time.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.083
Carmen...

34:56.085 --> 34:58.942
I do trust you,

34:58.944 --> 35:01.869
And it would be nice
to have someone in my life,

35:01.870 --> 35:03.994
Aware of what's going on
with me.

35:03.997 --> 35:06.455
So I wanna introduce you
to someone...

35:06.457 --> 35:07.851
Someone I'm very serious about.

35:07.853 --> 35:09.779
Alejandro, I had no idea.

35:09.781 --> 35:11.607
No one does.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.632
What do you mean? Is she in the business?

35:14.634 --> 35:17.889
Carmen, I want you
to meet Scott...

35:17.890 --> 35:19.451
My boyfriend.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.386
hi. Welcome.

35:30.388 --> 35:32.511
Genevieve.

35:33.679 --> 35:34.907
I heard Phillipe
was your plus one.

35:34.909 --> 35:36.767
And we also brought
our son Remi

35:36.769 --> 35:38.695
And his new girlfriend Valentina.
Hi.

35:38.697 --> 35:40.555
How you doing?

35:40.557 --> 35:42.750
Just to make it a family affair.
You don't mind, do you?

35:42.750 --> 35:45.509
Why would I mind you
bringing two extra people...

35:45.512 --> 35:47.004
To a dinner party?

35:47.006 --> 35:50.892
you know what they say.
The more, the merrier.

35:50.894 --> 35:53.816
whoever
says that, I want them to stop.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.412
I'll get some more chairs.

35:55.414 --> 35:57.972
I'll do it. Watch the door.
 okay.

35:57.974 --> 36:00.034
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Traffic was awful.

36:00.035 --> 36:01.695
You must be Brad?

36:01.697 --> 36:02.991
Yeah.

36:02.993 --> 36:04.652
We've been expecting you.

36:14.426 --> 36:16.219
You fought with Adrian Powell?

36:16.221 --> 36:18.712
Yeah, well, I tried to. Why?

36:18.714 --> 36:20.440
He insulted Rosie.

36:20.442 --> 36:23.199
He offered her money for sex.

36:23.201 --> 36:25.792
Are you kidding me?
That is so gross.

36:25.794 --> 36:26.821
Is she here?

36:26.823 --> 36:28.350
She's at the store.

36:28.352 --> 36:29.647
Well, I went over
to Adrian's house

36:29.648 --> 36:33.170
To set him straight, but...

36:33.172 --> 36:34.534
Before I could punch
his lights out,

36:34.536 --> 36:38.588
I slipped and gave myself
a concussion.

36:38.590 --> 36:42.576
And... You did this for Rosie?

36:42.578 --> 36:45.766
Yeah, and I-I don't know why.
I...

36:45.768 --> 36:50.786
Guess I was... Avenging her.

36:50.788 --> 36:54.474
If you wanna laugh at me,
go ahead.

36:54.476 --> 36:56.202
Now why would I laugh?

36:56.204 --> 36:58.263
'Cause I made
a fool out of myself.

36:58.265 --> 37:01.786
You defended a woman
who was sexually harassed.

37:01.788 --> 37:04.413
That's not funny.

37:04.415 --> 37:06.441
It's gallant as hell.

37:08.203 --> 37:09.266
Wow.

37:09.268 --> 37:12.091
It's been a while.

37:12.093 --> 37:14.317
Since what?

37:14.319 --> 37:16.777
Since you've been nice to me.

37:16.780 --> 37:18.338
Thanks.

37:18.340 --> 37:21.728
You surprised me today.

37:21.731 --> 37:24.653
My brave boy.

37:24.655 --> 37:28.044
If you can keep doing that,

37:28.046 --> 37:31.333
I think we're gonna be okay.

37:57.093 --> 37:59.220
Okay.

37:59.222 --> 38:00.417
Okay.

38:00.418 --> 38:02.943
Taylor and I...

38:02.944 --> 38:05.102
Have a little announcement
to make,

38:05.105 --> 38:07.463
And we're not telling everyone
just yet

38:07.465 --> 38:10.021
For reasons that will
soon become obvious

38:10.022 --> 38:12.348
In a little less
than nine months.

38:12.350 --> 38:15.041
It seems I'm going to
become a father.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.437
Oh!

38:16.438 --> 38:17.632
congratulations!

38:17.634 --> 38:19.892
Fantastic.  that's great.

38:22.886 --> 38:24.147
cheers, cheers.

38:24.149 --> 38:25.144
cheers.

38:27.574 --> 38:29.133
Can you come with me?

38:29.134 --> 38:30.295
I need to talk to you
for a second.

38:30.297 --> 38:32.323
I'm cleaning as fast as I can.

38:32.325 --> 38:35.247
This isn't about this party.

38:35.249 --> 38:37.276
I'm Eddie's mother.

39:07.156 --> 39:09.184
I am <i>not</i> screwing around.

39:09.186 --> 39:11.112
I will go to the police,

39:11.114 --> 39:12.707
And I will tell them
about your little endeavor

39:12.709 --> 39:14.103
Unless I start
getting some answers.

39:14.104 --> 39:16.263
Look, I didn't know
Flora was pregnant, I swear.

39:16.265 --> 39:18.690
But you were aware
she was cheating on Eddie.

39:18.692 --> 39:23.044
We... we were working a party
for Flora's boss.

39:23.044 --> 39:26.266
Eddie was doing some business
with some trust fund brats.

39:26.268 --> 39:28.793
Anyway, there was this one kid.

39:28.795 --> 39:29.823
The second Eddie's back
was turned,

39:29.824 --> 39:31.685
Flora was all over him.

39:31.686 --> 39:33.811
Couple weeks later,
I saw them out together.

39:33.812 --> 39:36.138
I need a name.

39:43.085 --> 39:45.976
I don't ask customers
for names.

39:45.978 --> 39:48.269
He's over there.
You can ask him yourself.

39:48.272 --> 39:51.759
Over where? He's at this party?

39:51.761 --> 39:53.355
Right there.

39:57.877 --> 40:01.066
Remi Delatour?

40:01.068 --> 40:02.283
If you say so.

40:02.285 --> 40:04.751
All I knew about him
was he liked coke

40:04.753 --> 40:07.611
And could afford a lot of it.

40:14.058 --> 40:15.374
oh, my God.

40:15.375 --> 40:19.714
Oh, my God! Michael! Michael!

40:29.418 --> 40:30.405
Somebody!

40:30.407 --> 40:32.411
Get a knife! Now!

40:35.699 --> 40:39.023
Call 9-1-1!
Somebody call 9-1-1!

40:51.621 --> 40:54.875
please come back to me, baby.

40:54.877 --> 40:57.999
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

40:58.002 --> 41:01.947
Please come back to me.

41:06.090 --> 41:09.149
wake up, please.
I'm so sorry.

41:09.151 --> 41:12.833
Please.

41:15.235 --> 41:17.899
Just come back, babe.
