Cabbie, we'll just go
and get out here and walk.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.317
It's a bloody zoo out there.

00:22.385 --> 00:24.483
Out.

00:24.551 --> 00:27.414
Out.

00:27.481 --> 00:28.446
Get it up.

00:28.514 --> 00:30.611
Keep the change, my friend.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.699
Ok, let's go.

00:55.631 --> 00:57.296
Mary?

00:57.364 --> 00:59.995
Mary.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.489
It's not like there aren't
any decent schools around here.

01:26.557 --> 01:28.151
But, oh, no, my little genius,

01:28.219 --> 01:29.880
she's got her heart set
on Berkeley,

01:29.948 --> 01:31.479
which is 3,000 bloody
miles away, right?

01:31.547 --> 01:32.511
This is her mother's doing.

01:32.579 --> 01:34.076
It's got her fingerprints
all over it.

01:34.144 --> 01:36.076
And now Emily's late, right?

01:36.144 --> 01:37.610
I can't even find
my picture I.D.

01:37.677 --> 01:39.109
So, what's the matter?

01:39.177 --> 01:40.942
Remember Henry Andrews?

01:41.010 --> 01:42.476
Pentagon, 2003.

01:42.544 --> 01:43.875
He just called.

01:43.943 --> 01:45.175
He wants to tell you the truth

01:45.243 --> 01:48.342
about the whole Jimmy Doyle
business, face to face.

01:48.410 --> 01:50.908
That was 7 years ago.
He wants to come clean about that now?

01:50.976 --> 01:52.774
He was 10 minutes away
when he called.

01:52.842 --> 01:56.041
Well, I got to be at the
airport in about 10 minutes.

01:56.109 --> 01:58.542
Ohh!

01:58.610 --> 01:59.542
What was that?

02:17.178 --> 02:18.577
Emily.

02:21.211 --> 02:22.742
Come on, Loker.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.976
Pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

02:34.847 --> 02:36.147
Someone, please!

02:36.214 --> 02:38.147
Somebody help!

02:38.215 --> 02:40.814
I need a little help here!

02:49.251 --> 02:51.918
There was a man in that
car and he's in...

02:51.985 --> 02:55.086
He's dead. He...

02:55.153 --> 02:56.219
It was...

02:56.287 --> 02:57.253
He's in shock.

02:57.321 --> 02:58.987
Let's get him
to the break room.

02:59.055 --> 03:00.321
Come on this way.

03:05.358 --> 03:07.292
All circuits
are busy now.

03:07.359 --> 03:09.526
Will you please try your
call a--

03:09.594 --> 03:12.863
Metro authorities
have closed off...

03:12.931 --> 03:14.999
Until further notice.

03:15.067 --> 03:17.435
The police department, along
with the fire department,

03:17.503 --> 03:18.436
will be controlled...

03:18.504 --> 03:19.470
Dr. Lightman?

03:21.840 --> 03:25.275
This just came for you.
The man said it was urgent.

03:30.279 --> 03:31.945
Drink it.

03:32.013 --> 03:34.414
What man? What did he--
when did he come?

03:34.482 --> 03:36.784
Um, just before it-- he said
no matter what happened next,

03:36.851 --> 03:38.018
You need to open this.

03:38.086 --> 03:39.519
All right, what'd he look like?
What did he look like?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.621
Um, he was wearing
a hat, sunglasses.

03:41.690 --> 03:42.791
It was really quick.

03:42.858 --> 03:44.894
I was just about
to go to lunch.

03:44.962 --> 03:47.230
If I hadn't had to stay
for this, I could--

03:47.297 --> 03:48.931
Yeah, I know.
Here's Emily's number.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.166
I want you to call her.

03:50.233 --> 03:51.900
You get her on the phone,
you come and find me.

03:51.968 --> 03:52.901
All right, darling?

03:52.969 --> 03:53.902
All right.
Ok.

03:53.970 --> 03:56.404
...To and from each...

03:56.472 --> 03:58.006
According to reports,
the car was traveling South

03:58.073 --> 03:59.307
On seventh near Harvard Square

03:59.375 --> 04:02.479
When the bomb detonated,
killing the driver instantly,

04:02.546 --> 04:04.886
Whose identity is unknown
at this point.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.622
The cause of the explosion
is as yet unknown...

04:07.689 --> 04:09.089
What is that?

04:09.157 --> 04:10.357
...Of several government
counterterrorist agencies...

04:10.424 --> 04:12.592
All right, what's important
for me right now

04:12.660 --> 04:14.662
Is to talk to Emily,
so make him comfortable

04:14.729 --> 04:15.763
And give him some tea.

04:15.831 --> 04:17.933
No, no, no, you know
something about this bomb

04:18.000 --> 04:19.267
Or at least you think you do.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.237
I know that look!

04:22.206 --> 04:23.806
It's got to be gridlock
out there.

04:23.874 --> 04:26.510
Emily's probably stuck in it.

04:29.514 --> 04:30.947
Say it.

04:31.782 --> 04:34.116
Go on. You can say it.

04:34.184 --> 04:38.455

05:08.350 --> 05:10.952
This came just moments before
that bomb went off, right?

05:11.020 --> 05:13.421
"lightman, psych evaluation,

05:13.489 --> 05:16.786
March 20, 2003, session one."

Ring any bells?

05:19.652 --> 05:22.584
UCM stadium,
tunnel 6, 1 P.M.

05:22.652 --> 05:25.389
Or Doyle gets
the other 5 tapes.

05:25.456 --> 05:27.292
Someone's blackmailing you?

05:27.360 --> 05:29.196
Is that what it is?

05:42.779 --> 05:43.945
Dr. Lightman.

05:44.013 --> 05:45.180
Dr. Foster.

05:45.248 --> 05:46.348
It's nice to meet you.

05:46.416 --> 05:48.183
How do you do?

05:50.553 --> 05:55.090
Apparently, my job here
depends on my meeting with you.

05:56.426 --> 05:58.626
So, did they tell you
all about me, then?

05:58.694 --> 06:00.461
Did they also tell you
why they sent me,

06:00.529 --> 06:02.395
So you could officially

06:02.463 --> 06:06.533
Diagnose me as broken
in the head?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.368
No longer reliable.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.303
Not to be taken seriously.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.572
I'm here to help you,
Dr. Lightman,

06:12.640 --> 06:14.708
Not judge you or rubber stamp

06:14.776 --> 06:16.944
Anyone's attempts
to discredit you

06:17.011 --> 06:18.412
Or your science.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.748
Which, by the way, happens to
be of great interest to me.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.083
Oh, yeah?

06:22.151 --> 06:24.219
Is this session being recorded?

06:24.287 --> 06:27.956
This office is for therapy
and counseling only.

06:28.023 --> 06:29.390
I would not tolerate

06:29.458 --> 06:32.427
Anyone recording
what is said in here.

06:34.530 --> 06:36.831
Who would send you this?

06:40.836 --> 06:42.803
Did you know the sessions
were being taped,

06:42.871 --> 06:45.039
And if so, who was doing
the recording?

06:46.909 --> 06:49.910
You can't just sit in here
and talk about me.

06:49.978 --> 06:51.612
Sit down.

06:52.814 --> 06:54.949
It was the Pentagon.

06:55.016 --> 06:57.318
Of course it occurred to me
it could have been bugged.

06:57.386 --> 06:58.752
Do I know by who?

06:58.819 --> 07:01.888
You know me better
than that, cal.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.926
Did, uh, Anna reach Emily yet?

07:06.994 --> 07:09.028
No, no.
She's still trying.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.931
I can't just walk away from it.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.399
You can't just walk away
from me

07:13.467 --> 07:14.900
When anyone with
half a brain knows that

07:14.968 --> 07:16.101
You both know something
about that bomb,

07:16.169 --> 07:19.171
Which, by the way, came
this close to killing me.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.573
Mr. Andrews,
the confirmed victim,

07:21.641 --> 07:23.342
A british born U.S. Citizen

07:23.410 --> 07:24.676
And fossil fuel entrepreneur.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.079
Now, here's what we're learning
about him at this hour.

07:27.146 --> 07:28.513
He was a bachelor...
You do know that man.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.450
Right now we're being told that
we're going to take you live

07:31.517 --> 07:33.619
To the director
of national intelligence

07:33.686 --> 07:35.154
At FBI headquarters.

07:35.221 --> 07:38.857
We do not yet know who is responsible,
but multiple agencies...

07:38.925 --> 07:40.259
That's a lie.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.794
Ok, lightman, we know
you knew the victim.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.529
What else do you know?

07:44.597 --> 07:47.299
That man was killed
by Jimmy Doyle,

07:47.367 --> 07:50.369
One of the most dangerous
bastards I've ever come across.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.870
Doyle. Irish?

07:53.973 --> 07:55.340
Belfast.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.875
You ok, foster?

07:57.844 --> 07:59.445
Everything's fine.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.348
All right, the man
that was killed by that bomb

08:02.416 --> 08:05.651
Was not a foss fuel
entrepreneur.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.921
He was british liaison
for counterterrorism

08:07.989 --> 08:09.155
At the Pentagon.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.958
And 7 years ago he was my boss.

08:12.026 --> 08:14.360
Ok, who is he to you, Frost?

08:14.428 --> 08:16.362
Did you work
at the Pentagon, too, or...

08:16.430 --> 08:17.930
Oh, my God,

08:17.997 --> 08:19.164
Dad?
You did.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.067
Where you been?
I was worried sick.

08:23.134 --> 08:24.835
I was stuck out in the mess
with everyone else.

08:24.902 --> 08:25.969
What's going on?

08:26.037 --> 08:28.070
That's what we all
want to know.

08:28.138 --> 08:30.374
Look, you know, I'm sorry

08:30.441 --> 08:31.608
About what you just
went through,

08:31.676 --> 08:34.078
But right now I need a
moment with my daughter.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.412
After that, I'll figure out

08:35.480 --> 08:37.246
How I'm gonna use
you guys on this.

08:37.315 --> 08:39.249
That's how it works, so end
of conversation, all right?

08:39.316 --> 08:40.616
That was a conversation?

08:41.717 --> 08:42.717
Hey.

08:42.785 --> 08:44.620
Ok. All right.

08:47.056 --> 08:49.191
How are you doing?

08:49.259 --> 08:52.729
I'm sorry about Berkeley.

08:52.797 --> 08:54.631
All right? We'll do that
another weekend.

08:54.699 --> 08:56.367
We'll do it soon, I promise.

08:56.434 --> 08:58.469
But right now, I need
you to do me a favor.

08:58.537 --> 09:02.072
Do you have a friend that you
can stay with for a day or two?

09:02.140 --> 09:05.076
Can it be a boy?

09:06.811 --> 09:07.975
"can it be a boy?"

09:08.043 --> 09:09.542
You know I had no idea

09:09.610 --> 09:11.142
Our sessions were being
recorded back then.

09:11.210 --> 09:12.510
You know, since we're so close,

09:12.578 --> 09:14.915
That means you, scientifically
speaking, of course,

09:14.983 --> 09:17.789
Are my blind spot,
which you well know.

09:17.856 --> 09:18.991
Meaning you don't believe me.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.427
I didn't say that.
Did I say that?

09:20.495 --> 09:21.696
Emotionally,
you want to believe me.

09:21.764 --> 09:22.964
Scientifically,
you can't be sure.

09:23.032 --> 09:24.766
Please, don't go after
those tapes.

09:24.833 --> 09:27.335
It's not worth it.
Don't go to that stadium.

09:27.403 --> 09:30.805
What's not worth it?

09:32.107 --> 09:34.008
You have no idea
who's behind this

09:34.076 --> 09:35.510
Or what this is really about.

09:35.578 --> 09:39.780
I mean, do you know
who's behind this?

09:39.848 --> 09:41.883
Drop it, cal.

09:41.950 --> 09:43.217
I'm not doing this.

09:43.285 --> 09:44.385
All right.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.953
Look, no one knows
I'm doing this,

09:46.021 --> 09:47.822
Understand? No one.

09:59.201 --> 10:00.635
Doyle?

10:00.703 --> 10:02.968
Dr. Lightman.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.836
7 years ago,

10:04.904 --> 10:08.839
You were involved in the murder
of my wife and daughter.

10:08.907 --> 10:10.907
Yeah, that's me.

10:10.975 --> 10:12.542
Yeah.

10:14.044 --> 10:17.847
Do you have a family now,
Dr. Lightman?

10:17.914 --> 10:20.916
You already know the answer
to that question, don't you?

10:20.984 --> 10:22.584
How old is she?

10:22.652 --> 10:25.487
Your daughter, Emily.

10:25.555 --> 10:27.189
You leave my daughter alone.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.158
How old is she?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.494
16.

10:44.307 --> 10:48.077
I didn't plant that bomb
in Andrews' car.

10:48.144 --> 10:51.447
Now you got my attention.

10:51.514 --> 10:54.350
Sure, tracked him down,

10:54.418 --> 10:57.253
I put the fear of God in him.

10:57.321 --> 11:00.357
But he swore he didn't know
who killed my girls.

11:00.424 --> 11:02.359
After I was done with him,

11:02.426 --> 11:06.095
I tailed him to a corner store.

11:09.199 --> 11:11.034
He bought this.

11:11.102 --> 11:12.469
A throwaway phone.

11:12.536 --> 11:15.872
Made 2 calls, then tossed it.

11:15.939 --> 11:17.640
That's my office.

11:17.708 --> 11:18.741
Yeah.

11:18.809 --> 11:20.076
And the other number
I don't know.

11:20.143 --> 11:22.245
It's untraceable.

11:22.312 --> 11:24.247
Well, if you didn't
kill Andrews,

11:24.314 --> 11:27.917
Whoever did, they made it
look like your work.

11:29.919 --> 11:32.788
You got 24 hours to find the
killer of my wife and daughter

11:32.855 --> 11:35.223
Or you're a dead man.

11:35.291 --> 11:38.226
Yeah, uh...I need to show you something.
Can I show you something?

11:39.362 --> 11:40.629
Go on.

11:47.803 --> 11:49.204
Here.

11:50.573 --> 11:54.109
Someone's trying to use my
fear of you to blackmail me.

11:54.176 --> 11:57.779
But now that we've met, it's kind
of a moot point, don't you think?

11:57.847 --> 12:00.014
These tapes--
what's on them?

12:00.849 --> 12:03.785
It's me talking about...

12:03.852 --> 12:07.922
My role in the death
of your wife and daughter.

12:09.058 --> 12:11.893
Now, I'm gonna find
whoever made these tapes

12:11.961 --> 12:14.529
And they're gonna tell me
who killed your family.

12:14.597 --> 12:15.964
I'll do that for
your wife and daughter.

12:16.031 --> 12:17.365
I won't do it for that.

12:17.433 --> 12:19.868
For now.

12:43.940 --> 12:45.735
Dr. Lightman
left without his phone.

12:45.779 --> 12:48.121
He gave it to me so I could
track down Emily for him.

12:49.909 --> 12:50.895
You ok?

12:52.209 --> 12:53.608
Is there anything I can do?

12:54.068 --> 12:55.138
No. Thanks.

13:00.103 --> 13:01.897
So you're the in-house
shrink, are you?

13:02.423 --> 13:04.216
I'm a psychologist.

13:04.591 --> 13:06.108
Oh, yeah. Psi ops.

13:06.981 --> 13:09.404
Let's see, dirty
tricks brigade, eh?

13:10.277 --> 13:11.728
Speaking of dirty tricks--

13:11.848 --> 13:12.517
No, you see,

13:12.799 --> 13:15.127
That wasn't supposed to happen.

13:15.663 --> 13:17.660
Well, now that it has happened,
how do you feel about it?

13:17.780 --> 13:18.937
Is this a plant?

13:19.500 --> 13:22.232
I mean, is this supposed
to soften me up?

13:23.472 --> 13:26.054
Yes. That's exactly
what it is.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.284
Well, it's working.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.822
3 days ago,
when I was undercover

13:39.860 --> 13:42.216
In a bar in Boston, right,

13:42.695 --> 13:45.213
4 ira men from belfast

13:45.251 --> 13:48.130
Were there to talk
about a peace agreement

13:48.178 --> 13:50.138
With their American money
who were feeling a pinch

13:50.258 --> 13:51.453
From the war on terror.

13:51.800 --> 13:56.552
And my read
on one of these ira men,

13:57.021 --> 13:58.786
Jimmy Doyle, was...

14:01.527 --> 14:03.593
That he was about
to ruin the peace.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.797
And someone in this building

14:08.994 --> 14:10.563
Took that as license
to kill him.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.408
Only the morons messed it up.

14:14.942 --> 14:16.723
They killed his wife
and daughter instead.

14:19.201 --> 14:20.393
How do you think I feel?

14:22.300 --> 14:24.384
You know, the paper says

14:24.452 --> 14:28.429
They caught the two men who robbed and
killed Mary and bernadette Doyle.

14:29.171 --> 14:31.265
But, darling,
that's a cover-up.

14:31.385 --> 14:33.563
That's two junkies with records

14:33.630 --> 14:35.276
Framed and flushed
down the toilet as we speak.

14:35.313 --> 14:37.247
I mean, come on,
you're an intelligent woman.

14:37.454 --> 14:38.844
You feel responsible.

14:39.801 --> 14:40.622
Ashamed.

14:41.026 --> 14:41.777
Guilty.

14:42.312 --> 14:46.308
My daughter is the same age
as that little dead girl.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.533
That's empathy, which is healthy,
but it doesn't make you guilty.

14:49.751 --> 14:52.465
So where is this--
this Doyle now?

14:52.585 --> 14:53.479
He got away.

14:55.113 --> 14:56.418
Are you sure he's a terrorist?

14:56.849 --> 14:58.210
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

14:58.905 --> 15:01.074
Oh, even more so now we've
murdered his family.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.548
Porn?

15:39.290 --> 15:40.651
You are human.

15:41.393 --> 15:43.682
You seem to be making
a speedy recovery.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.785
What are you really
working on there?

15:46.133 --> 15:48.829
Personal stuff.
It's my personal laptop.

15:48.949 --> 15:49.721
Personal stuff.

15:49.841 --> 15:51.007
In the middle of all this?

15:51.664 --> 15:53.810
That's what I call
compartmentalization.

15:54.908 --> 15:56.392
Did they teach you that
at the Pentagon?

15:56.880 --> 15:58.617
Can I help you
with something, Eli?

15:59.363 --> 16:00.377
Actually, you can...

16:00.987 --> 16:02.133
Gillian.

16:07.452 --> 16:09.667
- You hacked into-- you can't do that!
- In my sleep.

16:13.024 --> 16:15.128
Here's what I know.
In 2003,

16:15.156 --> 16:16.142
You were at the Pentagon

16:16.183 --> 16:17.903
When Henry Andrews,
the man whose blood

16:17.931 --> 16:19.611
I just cleaned off my face,

16:19.837 --> 16:22.574
Ordered you to evaluate
a member of his team,

16:23.654 --> 16:26.067
Dr. Cal lightman,
who was acting irrationally

16:26.396 --> 16:28.719
And I quote, "in danger
of causing serious harm

16:28.770 --> 16:30.914
To ongoing counterterrorist
operations."

16:33.863 --> 16:35.252
It could have been worse.

16:37.009 --> 16:38.354
It could have been porn.

16:45.626 --> 16:48.218
Lightman didn't believe
the robbery-homicide story.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.772
You mean the Pentagon's
cover-up story.

16:51.523 --> 16:52.529
Those two men were found guilty

16:52.557 --> 16:54.294
Of the murders of
Mary and bernadette Doyle

16:54.313 --> 16:55.946
By their peers
in a court of law.

16:56.829 --> 16:59.247
You know what I hear
in that official,

16:59.285 --> 17:01.501
Very un-foster-like
speech pattern?

17:02.233 --> 17:03.617
Fear and doubt.

17:11.078 --> 17:12.632
Lightman wanted to go public

17:12.669 --> 17:15.458
With what he believed
was the real story.

17:15.815 --> 17:17.185
He wanted to blow the whistle

17:17.223 --> 17:18.983
On a botched
Pentagon ordered hit?

17:19.104 --> 17:20.402
To prevent him from doing that,

17:20.430 --> 17:23.200
Or at least to discredit
his mental state if he tried,

17:23.233 --> 17:24.838
His boss sent him to see me.

17:30.062 --> 17:34.193
His boss--henry andrews-- the man
who was killed in that car bomb.

17:36.268 --> 17:38.431
Did lightman ever
blow the whistle?

17:39.272 --> 17:41.557
His life was in serious danger.

17:41.677 --> 17:43.463
See, that doesn't
sound like lightman.

17:44.909 --> 17:46.625
A lot of what lightman
does these days

17:46.662 --> 17:47.902
Is because of what...

17:48.484 --> 17:50.155
He didn't do back then.

17:50.406 --> 17:51.889
Odd.

17:53.053 --> 17:55.699
So I was almost killed
by a terrorist

17:55.819 --> 17:57.380
Who is after lightman.

18:04.998 --> 18:06.528
Jimmy Doyle killed Andrews.

18:11.093 --> 18:12.858
You could be next,
Dr. Lightman.

18:13.450 --> 18:16.004
I don't talk to people
whose faces I can't see.

18:16.239 --> 18:17.685
You want the tapes back or not?

18:17.805 --> 18:19.308
How do I know
you've even got them?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.024
What do I have to do
for the rest of them?

18:38.240 --> 18:39.386
Find Doyle.

18:39.930 --> 18:41.048
Flush him out.

18:41.592 --> 18:42.796
We'll take care of the rest.

18:43.781 --> 18:45.049
Like you did the last time.

18:47.143 --> 18:48.617
Who are you?

18:48.737 --> 18:50.730
Uhh!

18:50.850 --> 18:52.570
Uhh!

18:52.796 --> 18:53.855
Ohh!

19:23.001 --> 19:25.204
What?

19:25.271 --> 19:26.665
The disk.

19:29.809 --> 19:32.811
I'll save you the trouble
if you like.

19:32.879 --> 19:34.914
Somewhere on there,

19:34.981 --> 19:37.482
I called you a terrorist.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.417
Terrorist scum I think it was.

19:39.485 --> 19:43.921
At least I never killed
innocent women and children.

19:43.989 --> 19:46.925
All fanatics wash their hands
of the blood of the innocent

19:46.992 --> 19:48.960
In the name of the cause.

19:49.028 --> 19:51.328
Right?

19:55.700 --> 19:58.202
Do me a favor.

19:58.270 --> 20:00.301
You're no innocent, lightman.

20:00.369 --> 20:03.368
No by any stretch
of the imagination.

20:10.608 --> 20:11.975
Hey.

20:12.043 --> 20:14.574
I thought I told you
to go to Torres' place.

20:14.642 --> 20:16.475
I will when she gets off work.

20:16.542 --> 20:18.309
If it's safe enough
here for everyone else,

20:18.377 --> 20:19.977
It's safe enough for me.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.678
That's a fair point.

20:21.745 --> 20:23.179
What happened to your face?

20:23.247 --> 20:25.347
I fell, officer.

20:25.414 --> 20:27.048
Where's foster?

20:27.116 --> 20:28.750
Quit changing the subject.
Where were you?

20:28.818 --> 20:29.785
I was working.

20:29.852 --> 20:30.952
And, yes, on this bomb.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.021
And I can't tell you about it,
and you know that.

20:33.089 --> 20:34.423
So will you do me a favor?

20:34.491 --> 20:36.292
Could you find foster
for me, please?

20:36.359 --> 20:38.127
Uh, hi.

20:48.237 --> 20:50.071
You must be Emily.

20:51.573 --> 20:53.874
Hello.

20:53.942 --> 20:56.743
This is Mr. Doyle.

20:59.914 --> 21:01.414
I'll explain later, darling.

21:01.481 --> 21:03.616
Will you find foster for me?

21:10.991 --> 21:13.692
Let's talk
about your family.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.394
Yeah?

21:15.462 --> 21:16.895
No.

21:16.963 --> 21:18.197
Why?

21:18.264 --> 21:21.500
Your wife Zoe
and your daughter Emily.

21:21.568 --> 21:23.235
Off limits.

21:26.305 --> 21:29.240
It must be quite a strain...

21:29.308 --> 21:31.575
Juggling family with
the type of work you do.

21:31.643 --> 21:32.977
No, it's not.

21:33.044 --> 21:34.912
I mean, not if your family
comes first, it's not.

21:34.979 --> 21:37.248
And not to mention the
dangerous set of circumstances

21:37.316 --> 21:40.151
You clearly believe yourself
to be in right now.

21:43.255 --> 21:45.322
All right, I get it.
It's loud and clear.

21:45.390 --> 21:46.657
That's all I need to hear.

21:46.725 --> 21:48.526
Now, you tell them
I'll go quietly.

21:48.593 --> 21:49.493
Just leave my family alone.

21:49.561 --> 21:51.428
Dr. Lightman,
that's not what I meant.

21:51.496 --> 21:54.198
So you're calling me
paranoid, eh?

21:54.266 --> 21:56.667
I was referring to Doyle still
being out there somewhere.

21:56.735 --> 21:58.535
You're trying to tell me
something else, right?

21:58.603 --> 22:00.537
Only you can't.

22:00.605 --> 22:02.206
Why is that?

22:02.274 --> 22:03.474
Hey?

22:03.542 --> 22:05.676
There it is again.

22:06.945 --> 22:09.713
Thank you very much.

22:17.786 --> 22:19.754
What's this?

22:19.821 --> 22:22.389
This...

22:22.457 --> 22:23.657
Is Jimmy Doyle.

22:23.725 --> 22:25.459
I know who it is.

22:25.527 --> 22:28.229
He's not a threat to us.

22:28.296 --> 22:30.397
Unless I fail
to do right by him.

22:30.464 --> 22:31.898
Do right by him?

22:36.305 --> 22:37.772
Who did that to your face?

22:37.840 --> 22:41.609
When we first met
at the Pentagon,

22:41.677 --> 22:44.412
Who did you report to?

22:44.480 --> 22:46.314
Andrews. You know that.

22:46.382 --> 22:48.182
No one else.
Who else?

22:48.250 --> 22:49.817
Who did Andrews report to?

22:49.885 --> 22:51.118
He never told me.

22:51.186 --> 22:54.922
This is really important.

22:54.990 --> 22:57.424
I can see that.

22:57.492 --> 23:01.427
But I still don't have
an answer for you.

23:01.495 --> 23:03.696
Are you gonna tell me
what that man is doing here?

23:03.764 --> 23:06.699
Well, this is our one chance
to right a huge wrong

23:06.767 --> 23:08.167
That we both played a part in.

23:08.235 --> 23:09.469
You are not to blame

23:09.536 --> 23:12.171
For the murders of
that man's family, cal.

23:12.239 --> 23:15.541
I'm not talking about
the murders.

23:15.609 --> 23:19.644
Actually, I'm talking
about the cover-up afterwards.

23:19.712 --> 23:22.613
I mean, me, that's one thing,
but you...

23:22.681 --> 23:25.649
You're way better than that.

23:25.717 --> 23:28.618
Which is something that's been
bothering me for a long time.

23:28.686 --> 23:31.954
Now, you know, whatever it is

23:32.022 --> 23:34.656
That you're hiding from me,
I forgive you.

23:34.724 --> 23:38.593
I have never hidden
anything from you, cal.

23:38.660 --> 23:40.361
Let it go.

23:41.396 --> 23:45.699
Why don't you ask Doyle
about Andrews?

23:45.767 --> 23:48.468
'cause I've always valued
your opinion.

23:59.715 --> 24:02.386
Jimmy Doyle, Gillian foster.

24:05.490 --> 24:06.791
What are you making him do?

24:06.858 --> 24:10.694
I just need to find my wife
and daughter's killer.

24:10.762 --> 24:11.962
To avenge them.

24:12.798 --> 24:14.200
Are you prepared to hunt

24:14.268 --> 24:15.805
And kill another man?

24:15.872 --> 24:17.074
I don't believe that.

24:17.141 --> 24:19.277
Even if he does
have a gun to your head.

24:19.345 --> 24:20.779
You know, 7 years ago,
I helped murder

24:20.846 --> 24:24.183
This man's wife and child.

24:24.250 --> 24:27.586
And now I would like to know
exactly who it was

24:27.654 --> 24:29.755
That I helped.

24:36.660 --> 24:37.760
Why now?

24:37.827 --> 24:39.061
Why now what?

24:39.128 --> 24:40.362
Kill Andrews?

24:40.429 --> 24:41.563
I didn't kill Andrews.

24:41.630 --> 24:43.965
I just talked to the man.

24:47.835 --> 24:49.936
Ok.

24:50.004 --> 24:53.405
Then why wait 7 years to come
back and do any of this?

24:53.473 --> 24:55.907
When Mary and bernadette
were murdered,

24:55.975 --> 24:58.409
I died that day, too.

24:58.477 --> 25:01.479
I went from grief to drink,
drugs, you name it.

25:01.546 --> 25:03.113
You were a member
of a terrorist organization.

25:03.181 --> 25:05.683
God knows how many lives
you're ruined, so, please.

25:06.818 --> 25:08.118
Bloody hell!

25:08.186 --> 25:10.187
How did you track Andrews down?

25:10.255 --> 25:12.756
I got his name from the
lawyer who represented

25:12.824 --> 25:13.957
The two junkies

25:14.025 --> 25:16.994
He framed for the murder
of my girls.

25:17.061 --> 25:18.495
Who is he?

25:18.563 --> 25:19.897
Where is he?

25:24.469 --> 25:28.138
Mmm. Almonds.
It smells like a bakery.

25:43.388 --> 25:47.090
Howard Moss!

26:03.541 --> 26:05.808
Bomb!

26:05.876 --> 26:07.109
Bomb!

26:21.559 --> 26:23.093
Out of the way.

26:24.529 --> 26:26.029
Almonds.

26:26.097 --> 26:27.964
C-4 smells like almonds.

26:32.531 --> 26:33.931
Cal, you ok?

26:33.999 --> 26:36.033
Yeah.

26:48.246 --> 26:50.214
I could listen to that all day.

26:50.282 --> 26:51.582
I thought we were done.

26:51.650 --> 26:53.884
Who's threatening my family?

26:53.952 --> 26:55.386
Dr. Lightman...

26:55.453 --> 26:57.421
Now, you see, I can see it in
your eyes, all over your face.

26:57.489 --> 26:58.923
It's as clear as day.
I'd just like to know

26:58.990 --> 27:02.526
Who it is and what it is
I'm dealing with here.

27:02.594 --> 27:04.695
I asked you about your family

27:04.763 --> 27:08.832
Like any therapist
would ask any patient.

27:11.502 --> 27:13.605
Maybe you're having
difficulty looking for a lie

27:13.672 --> 27:15.440
Because there
isn't one to find.

27:15.508 --> 27:19.345
I thought your lot called
patients clients these days.

27:19.413 --> 27:24.250
Listen, you don't have to talk
about your family with me.

27:24.318 --> 27:27.053
But you should find someone.

27:27.120 --> 27:31.624
You know, my wife...

27:31.692 --> 27:34.159
She doesn't know
about any of this.

27:36.929 --> 27:39.797
Would you like to talk to
her about it if you could?

27:39.865 --> 27:42.333
No, no, I don't mean
about my work in general,

27:42.401 --> 27:44.535
I mean about this Doyle mess.

27:44.602 --> 27:46.269
So do I.

27:46.337 --> 27:47.972
No, I would not like
to tell her about it.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.809
It would hurt her too much.

27:49.876 --> 27:53.449
Why did you choose to work
in counterterrorism?

27:53.517 --> 27:55.284
It is a choice.

27:55.352 --> 27:56.919
Well, the power of terrorists,

27:56.987 --> 28:00.088
It lies in the fear
of the innocent.

28:00.156 --> 28:01.990
I want to, um...

28:04.059 --> 28:05.893
Take that power away, you know?

28:05.961 --> 28:07.094
Why?

28:07.162 --> 28:09.998
I got a daughter.

28:16.873 --> 28:19.608
You know that in the war
against terror,

28:19.676 --> 28:22.144
There's often
collateral damage.

28:22.212 --> 28:24.613
As awful as that sounds.

28:24.681 --> 28:26.783
I'm sorry--what--
what are you saying?

28:26.851 --> 28:30.254
Some collateral damage
can be avoided.

28:30.322 --> 28:32.423
You talking about my Emily?

28:32.490 --> 28:35.860
We would be irresponsible...

28:35.927 --> 28:38.262
Not to talk about Emily.

28:49.206 --> 28:52.642
Oh, bloody hell.
That's all we need.

28:52.710 --> 28:53.809
Ohh--

28:53.877 --> 28:55.411
Uh, get--

28:55.479 --> 28:57.213
No, no, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.948
I can help myself up. Ohh...

28:59.016 --> 29:00.049
Sod off, you!

29:00.117 --> 29:02.451
Go on.
Hey!

29:05.389 --> 29:06.756
All right, look,

29:06.823 --> 29:09.324
You're gonna be all over the
bloody Internet in a minute,

29:09.392 --> 29:10.759
So, here, take that.

29:10.827 --> 29:14.329
Lay low, and don't answer that
unless her name comes up.

29:14.397 --> 29:16.965
You two are quite
the pair, aren't you?

29:17.033 --> 29:18.466
Are you still here?

29:20.202 --> 29:21.336
You all right?

29:21.404 --> 29:23.638
Yeah.

29:27.076 --> 29:29.344
Good morning.

29:29.412 --> 29:31.513
Yesterday, at 3:47 P.M.,

29:31.581 --> 29:34.682
A bomb composed of
high-grade c-4

29:34.750 --> 29:37.085
Made in the style and m.O.

29:37.152 --> 29:40.189
Of what we strongly suspect, according to
our friends from british intelligence,

29:40.257 --> 29:41.357
To be the work of a terrorist

29:41.425 --> 29:43.526
Named James, aka Jimmy, Doyle.

29:43.594 --> 29:45.896
Ah, well, that's a patent
lie for a starter.

29:45.963 --> 29:48.532
Excuse me? Dr. Lightman.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.034
Who the hell are you?

29:50.101 --> 29:52.268
Dr. Cal lightman,
deception expert.

29:52.336 --> 29:54.368
He knows who I am.
You know who I am, don't you?

29:54.436 --> 29:56.070
Why would you lie about that?

29:59.575 --> 30:00.975
Didn't you say excuse me?

30:01.043 --> 30:02.243
I mean, really,

30:02.310 --> 30:04.011
If we excused you
for the lies you tell,

30:04.079 --> 30:05.979
Where would it end, then?

30:16.426 --> 30:17.459
There.

30:17.527 --> 30:20.462
That's the man lightman
saw that we didn't.

30:20.530 --> 30:22.397
The one man there who
knew who's responsible

30:22.465 --> 30:23.465
For that car bomb.

30:24.734 --> 30:27.568
This press conference
is over. It's enough.

30:27.635 --> 30:29.236
What are you hiding,
Mr. Prosser?

30:29.303 --> 30:32.106
I want the room cleared, now.

30:34.042 --> 30:37.811
Dr. Lightman just asked you a
question on national television.

30:37.879 --> 30:40.747
I want to give you the opportunity
to answer him now, quickly,

30:40.815 --> 30:42.415
Before I go back
on national television

30:42.483 --> 30:43.817
To defend you
and to discredit him.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.352
Do you have more
information, then, Dr. Lightman?

30:45.420 --> 30:46.920
I'm not taking any questions.

30:50.889 --> 30:52.423
All right, lightman,

30:52.491 --> 30:55.526
This is a courtesy to your
resume and your FBI status,

30:55.593 --> 30:57.061
Both of which
are now on the line.

30:57.128 --> 30:59.698
You have a question
for him? Make it quick.

30:59.766 --> 31:01.934
Right.

31:02.001 --> 31:04.203
Doyle is not
a terrorist threat.

31:04.271 --> 31:08.940
He's a wanted terrorist from a
known terrorist organization.

31:09.008 --> 31:10.542
Doyle did not kill
Henry Andrews.

31:10.610 --> 31:12.611
We have forensic evidence
that links him to the car bomb

31:12.679 --> 31:14.045
And the apartment bomb
last night.

31:14.113 --> 31:15.313
Yeah, well, I have
scientific proof

31:15.381 --> 31:17.182
That says he has nothing
to do with either bomb.

31:17.249 --> 31:18.183
Scientific proof.

31:18.250 --> 31:19.250
Yeah.

31:19.318 --> 31:20.652
I spoke to the man.

31:20.719 --> 31:23.620
Which means that your
evidence was cooked.

31:23.688 --> 31:25.222
There's a shocker.

31:25.290 --> 31:26.590
You know where Doyle is?

31:26.658 --> 31:28.224
Because if you know
where he is--

31:28.292 --> 31:31.727
Mr. Prosser, how was St. Patrick's day, 
2003, for you?

31:31.795 --> 31:32.662
Excuse me?

31:32.729 --> 31:35.130
You know, the day
that Doyle's wife

31:35.198 --> 31:38.736
And 9-year-old daughter
were shot dead in Boston.

31:38.804 --> 31:41.472
Were you working
at the Pentagon back then?

31:42.808 --> 31:44.475
Put that one in the yes column.

31:44.542 --> 31:46.810
Yes, I was at the Pentagon then.

31:46.878 --> 31:50.547
What happened to your former
colleague Henry Andrews yesterday?

31:50.615 --> 31:53.183
He was tragically killed,

31:53.251 --> 31:55.319
Murdered,
by a terrorist car bomb.

31:55.386 --> 31:58.121
He, who was on his way
to tell me what happened

31:58.189 --> 31:59.989
That day in Boston, but
was killed by somebody

32:00.057 --> 32:02.425
Who couldn't afford the truth to get out.
How's that for quick, sir?

32:02.493 --> 32:04.961
Those are very serious
allegations, lightman.

32:05.029 --> 32:05.962
Wild allegations.

32:06.030 --> 32:06.996
Yeah.

32:07.064 --> 32:09.465
Based in science.

32:09.532 --> 32:11.433
Right, then.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.935
7 minutes by FBI chopper
to my lab,

32:15.003 --> 32:17.504
Where we can do this properly
and away from the press.

32:17.571 --> 32:21.507
I can even arrange a couple of FBI
agents as escort if you want.

32:21.575 --> 32:24.743
I don't think that'll be
necessary, will it, Richard?

32:24.811 --> 32:27.045
I've got nothing to hide.

32:28.915 --> 32:29.849
Fine.

32:36.823 --> 32:39.124
There's nothing to this.

32:39.192 --> 32:42.962
I mean, it's child's play
for a man like you, I know.

32:43.030 --> 32:45.998
Right. Uh...

32:46.066 --> 32:47.666
Where's the rest of these?

32:47.734 --> 32:49.302
At your office?

32:49.370 --> 32:51.938
Home?

32:52.006 --> 32:54.340
Safe deposit box?

32:54.408 --> 32:56.242
All right, home it is.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.477
2003, the Pentagon.

32:58.544 --> 32:59.377
What was your job?

32:59.444 --> 33:01.078
That's classified.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.446
But Henry Andrews--

33:03.514 --> 33:05.381
He reported to you, correct?

33:05.449 --> 33:07.750
That's also classified.

33:08.752 --> 33:09.952
All right, how about this?

33:10.019 --> 33:12.120
Today, your job is

33:12.188 --> 33:14.389
Assistant deputy director

33:14.457 --> 33:18.894
Over the, uh, department of national
intelligence. That's correct?

33:18.961 --> 33:20.562
That's correct.

33:20.630 --> 33:23.131
Do you like your job?

33:23.199 --> 33:26.000
I need your words, Mr. Prosser, 
for the machine.

33:26.067 --> 33:28.302
You know. It's not
as smart as I am.

33:28.369 --> 33:29.803
Though I say so myself.

33:29.870 --> 33:32.605
I'm proud of the work I do.

33:32.673 --> 33:35.875
But you'd like the director's
job even more, wouldn't you?

33:35.943 --> 33:37.209
Is that right?

33:38.043 --> 33:39.576
Ooh, blimey. There.

33:39.644 --> 33:42.243
That was almost a moment
of total honesty there.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.212
You feel all right?
You need to lie down?

33:44.280 --> 33:45.213
Excuse me.

33:45.281 --> 33:47.148
Uh, here, Mr. Prosser.
Jimmy Doyle--

33:47.215 --> 33:50.951
He says he's at your home
with Mrs. Prosser.

33:53.656 --> 33:55.390
Hello.

33:58.761 --> 34:02.430
I'd take that call
if I were you, Mr. Prosser.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.666
If you love Mrs. Prosser,
that is.

34:07.835 --> 34:10.272
Well, take it, anyway.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.650
I do not negotiate
with terrorists.

34:19.717 --> 34:22.554
Well, that's one way
of getting rid of the wife.

34:22.621 --> 34:24.723
How dare you.

34:24.791 --> 34:25.824
I love my wife.

34:25.891 --> 34:28.627
We need to send a team
to my house.

34:28.694 --> 34:30.762
Doyle's not at Prosser's house.

34:30.830 --> 34:32.429
Where is he?

34:32.498 --> 34:33.531
Don't know.

34:33.599 --> 34:36.001
Polygraph's a decoy, too.

34:36.068 --> 34:38.402
Lightman needs prosser
to focus on beating that

34:38.471 --> 34:40.839
So he can't mask the truth with
his eyes and his body language.

34:40.907 --> 34:44.677
Your wife's not so keen to
talk to you either, Mr. Prosser,

34:44.744 --> 34:47.012
Now she knows what you're done,

34:47.079 --> 34:49.414
Who you really are.

34:49.482 --> 34:51.583
You two are in this
together, aren't you?

34:51.652 --> 34:53.887
You're aiding and abetting
a wanted terrorist.

34:53.954 --> 34:55.989
Wanted for what?

34:56.056 --> 34:57.491
For the murder
of Henry Andrews.

34:57.558 --> 34:59.360
Now, listen.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.900
U see this?

35:05.968 --> 35:07.401
This was delivered

35:07.469 --> 35:08.936
To my office less than a minute

35:09.004 --> 35:11.705
Before Henry Andrews
blew past my window.

35:14.006 --> 35:16.672
You see this?

35:16.740 --> 35:20.509
This was given to me
a short time later,

35:20.576 --> 35:22.977
By one of your goons
at a stadium.

35:23.045 --> 35:25.613
You taped my sessions
with Dr. Lightman

35:25.681 --> 35:28.616
Without my knowledge.
Why?

35:28.684 --> 35:33.355
You authorized the assassination
of Jimmy Doyle back in 2003,

35:33.422 --> 35:34.990
Based on my intelligence.

35:35.057 --> 35:38.893
That's anger, and it's
directed at lightman.

35:38.961 --> 35:41.996
Prosser based his kill order
on Lightman's science.

35:42.064 --> 35:45.900
When your people
killed Doyle's family,

35:45.968 --> 35:47.969
You knew he'd be back one day.

35:48.037 --> 35:50.104
You planned to use these
to blackmail me

35:50.172 --> 35:52.306
To draw Doyle into
your crosshairs.

35:52.374 --> 35:54.308
And so, the lawyer,
he tips you off

35:54.376 --> 35:57.078
Doyle is back in town,
he's going after Andrews.

35:57.146 --> 35:59.580
So before Andrews could
lead Doyle back to you...

35:59.648 --> 36:00.915
Boom.

36:01.984 --> 36:04.185
No more Andrews.

36:04.253 --> 36:06.087
Made to look like Doyle's work,

36:06.155 --> 36:09.023
And boom, no more lawyer.

36:09.091 --> 36:11.592
Another loose end
taken care of.

36:11.659 --> 36:14.027
You can't prove anything.

36:14.095 --> 36:15.095
I'm not trying to.

36:15.162 --> 36:17.197
I mean, I'm not trying
to prove anything.

36:17.265 --> 36:18.365
I mean, not in a court of law.

36:18.432 --> 36:20.267
Right? Anyway,
I'm not that naive.

36:20.334 --> 36:23.102
No, I just-- I wanted
the truth, for myself.

36:23.170 --> 36:26.171
Now I've got it, you can go.
Have a nice life.

36:27.006 --> 36:28.806
What about Doyle?

36:28.874 --> 36:31.608
Doyle.

36:31.676 --> 36:33.809
You there?

36:34.977 --> 36:36.444
He's gone again.

36:37.379 --> 36:38.812
That's all right.
He'll be back,

36:38.880 --> 36:40.246
Sooner or later.

36:40.314 --> 36:42.748
Yeah, you should give us
a call when he shows up.

36:51.291 --> 36:53.825
I want protection.

36:54.894 --> 36:56.829
In return for what?

36:56.897 --> 36:59.433
And immunity.

36:59.501 --> 37:01.268
I never knew this
situation in Boston

37:01.336 --> 37:03.036
Was going to become
such a mess.

37:03.104 --> 37:04.905
When I found out
that Doyle was back,

37:04.973 --> 37:08.175
I told Finch that he needed
to clean up his own trash.

37:08.243 --> 37:10.611
Finch. Is that a code
or a real name?

37:10.678 --> 37:11.678
Code.

37:11.746 --> 37:14.080
I don't know his real name.

37:14.148 --> 37:17.416
But I never told him to
kill Andrews and the lawyer

37:17.484 --> 37:18.917
Or Doyle.

37:18.985 --> 37:20.919
I never used those words.

37:20.986 --> 37:23.154
I never said that.

37:25.558 --> 37:26.573
Call Finch.

37:40.336 --> 37:42.171
You better hurry
or you'll miss him.

37:44.239 --> 37:45.240
That's all of them.

37:45.308 --> 37:49.045
Send my best
to Dr. Foster. Gillian.

37:51.882 --> 37:55.385
Doyle. Where is he?

37:55.453 --> 37:58.421
Parkview Hotel.

37:58.489 --> 38:00.290
Room 344.

38:26.116 --> 38:27.683
Let's have a look
at your face, then.

38:27.751 --> 38:29.885
Yeah.

38:32.088 --> 38:35.857
The one cabdriver
I have never forgotten.

38:35.925 --> 38:37.658
Weapon.

38:37.726 --> 38:40.026
Slowly,

38:40.094 --> 38:42.862
Finger and thumb.

38:56.177 --> 38:57.411
Finch, huh?

38:57.479 --> 38:59.447
Finch?

39:00.950 --> 39:03.520
It's like a small bird.

39:03.588 --> 39:05.958
I was just following orders.

39:11.301 --> 39:13.572
Look at her.

39:15.277 --> 39:17.946
My bernadette

39:18.014 --> 39:21.283
Would have turned 16 today.

39:23.020 --> 39:26.822
Wait...I didn't mean for...

39:28.258 --> 39:31.025
You grabbed the gun when I...

39:31.092 --> 39:32.793
I'm sorry.

39:32.860 --> 39:34.694
I'm sorry.

39:34.762 --> 39:35.795
He is, you know.

39:35.863 --> 39:37.564
He is sorry.

39:37.631 --> 39:41.470
I can't tell how
genuine it is, so...

39:42.607 --> 39:45.409
It's up to you, Doyle, really.

39:45.477 --> 39:46.778
What?

39:48.981 --> 39:50.949
I am sorry, too.

40:01.925 --> 40:06.228
How did you know
the weapon wasn't loaded?

40:07.631 --> 40:09.831
I didn't.

40:11.467 --> 40:13.835
Why wasn't it?

40:13.903 --> 40:16.037
Love of revenge...

40:16.105 --> 40:18.240
Killed my girls.

40:32.161 --> 40:35.031
And so prosser gets immunity.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.467
Does he, hell.

40:36.534 --> 40:37.900
Why didn't you talk about

40:37.968 --> 40:41.004
What happened
to my girls that day?

40:41.071 --> 40:42.705
I have girls of my own, mate.

40:42.773 --> 40:47.977
Ah, I'll never get over
my hatred for you people.

40:58.254 --> 40:59.655
I was the one that told him.

40:59.723 --> 41:03.828
I said that the only way
to fight terrorism

41:03.896 --> 41:07.100
Was to fight like a terrorist,
and I meant that.

41:09.237 --> 41:10.470
So while I read Doyle
as a threat,

41:10.538 --> 41:14.543
I knew they'd kill him.
I wanted them to kill him.

41:14.611 --> 41:17.446
Do you think you can
forgive yourself?

41:20.783 --> 41:23.017
So were you ever gonna tell me?

41:42.503 --> 41:45.104
He came to me

41:45.172 --> 41:47.240
In the middle of the night,

41:47.308 --> 41:49.875
Before our first session.

41:49.943 --> 41:52.779
Not to my office, to my house.

41:54.248 --> 41:56.783
My house.

42:00.822 --> 42:06.060
I'd never seen him before
and I never saw him again.

42:06.127 --> 42:08.862
He told me to do what I had
to do to keep you quiet,

42:08.930 --> 42:13.766
Or Doyle wouldn't be the only man
to lose his wife and daughter.

42:15.769 --> 42:18.705
If I told you that it would
have been proof positive

42:18.772 --> 42:22.442
Of a cover-up, and you
would have never let go.

42:25.579 --> 42:27.447
So...

42:30.985 --> 42:33.620
I couldn't let you do that.

42:33.688 --> 42:37.725
To you, your family.

42:37.793 --> 42:40.195
You'd never have gotten
to blow the whistle.

42:40.263 --> 42:42.531
He would have cut you down

42:42.598 --> 42:44.599
Before you put it to your lips.

42:44.667 --> 42:51.271
So, all that talk about you
being a bad liar,

42:51.338 --> 42:52.605
That's just an act.

42:52.673 --> 42:55.707
Right? That's a lie.

42:57.276 --> 43:00.510
Depends on the lie.

43:00.511 --> 43:10.511
