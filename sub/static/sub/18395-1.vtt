00:38.352 --> 00:40.149
Well, everybody, that's our show.

00:40.232 --> 00:43.622
Thanks for spending Christmas Eve
at the House of Mouse.

00:43.712 --> 00:46.180
Here's wishing everybody
a merry Christmas

00:46.272 --> 00:49.309
and a safe trip ho-ho-home.

00:51.632 --> 00:53.907
Boy. What a great show.

00:53.992 --> 00:56.062
Mickey, it was just wonderful.

00:56.152 --> 00:58.791
And now we can all celebrate
our own Christmas at home.

00:58.872 --> 01:00.669
But we can't go home.

01:00.752 --> 01:04.506
- We're snowed in.
- Well, this is a fine predicament.

01:04.592 --> 01:06.947
Aw, it can't be that bad.

01:07.352 --> 01:08.387
Aw, no.

01:11.032 --> 01:15.071
- Did you hear, Belle? We can't go home.
- We can always build a home.

01:15.152 --> 01:17.188
l'm sure Mickey will think of something.

01:17.272 --> 01:20.708
l thought of something. We can have
our own Christmas party right here.

01:20.792 --> 01:22.623
That's a wonderful idea.

01:22.712 --> 01:24.384
Aw, humbug.

01:24.472 --> 01:26.269
Humbug? What's wrong, Donald?

01:26.352 --> 01:28.661
Once again
he just doesn't have the Christmas spirit.

01:28.752 --> 01:30.743
We'll see about that.

01:33.192 --> 01:36.343
Hot cocoa and cookies comin' through.

01:44.032 --> 01:47.308
Now this Christmas party
is really starting to warm up.

01:47.392 --> 01:49.781
- Hey, Mickey, look what l found.
- Oh, boy.

01:49.872 --> 01:52.432
A box of our all-time favourite
Christmas stories.

01:52.512 --> 01:56.141
- Humbug.
- Bug? We'll have what he's having.

01:56.232 --> 01:59.702
Timon, l think that ''humbug''
is something that you say

01:59.792 --> 02:02.386
when you don't have any Christmas spirit.

02:02.472 --> 02:06.590
Come on, Donald. This'll get you into the
spirit of the season. lt's a story about you.

02:11.072 --> 02:14.030
- Snowman contest?
- Today?

02:14.112 --> 02:15.864
We're gonna win.

02:50.352 --> 02:53.230
Oh, boy.
We're gonna win for sure.

02:53.312 --> 02:55.701
Wait. We're not done yet.

03:05.632 --> 03:09.830
Oh, boy.
Nothing beats a day of ice-skating.

03:55.072 --> 03:57.063
Aw, nuts.

04:04.632 --> 04:06.623
lt works.

05:01.432 --> 05:04.185
Hey. Why, l oughta...

05:06.112 --> 05:07.704
Aw, phooey.

05:16.072 --> 05:18.540
Hey, look. lt's Mickey Mouse.

05:47.712 --> 05:50.909
Whew. Safe at last.

05:51.912 --> 05:53.504
What...?

06:40.272 --> 06:41.910
Hello.

07:22.552 --> 07:26.750
We have a winner.
And here is your prize.

07:46.992 --> 07:50.826
- Did seein' that help your Christmas spirit?
- Oh, humbug.

07:50.912 --> 07:54.427
l have an idea what might help.
Hearing some yuletide wishes.

07:54.512 --> 07:55.501
Good idea, Minnie,

07:55.592 --> 08:00.063
cos earlier today l went out on the street
to see what everybody wanted.

08:00.152 --> 08:04.987
- What would you like for Christmas?
- That's easy. My two front teeth.

08:05.072 --> 08:07.063
Already got those.

08:07.432 --> 08:10.469
The lamp. Get me the lamp.

08:10.872 --> 08:14.421
What do we want for Christmas?
How about bunk beds?

08:14.792 --> 08:16.589
No strings to hold me down.

08:16.952 --> 08:21.230
- Bugs, grubs, worms and beetles.
- And air freshener.

08:21.592 --> 08:25.141
Your voice will do nicely.

08:26.592 --> 08:29.152
l wish l wasn't a dumb old llama any more.

08:29.512 --> 08:31.628
What do l wish for Christmas, Mickey?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.943
l wish that everyone
will find their inner beauty.

08:35.032 --> 08:39.469
- You know, you're all l wish for, Minnie.
- Aw, Mickey, that's sweet.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.543
Now what do you say
we keep the party going

08:41.631 --> 08:45.181
with Professor Ludwig Von Drake and
''The Science of Santa''.

08:45.272 --> 08:50.187
Today the professor is going to explain
how Santa can fly all over the world

08:50.272 --> 08:52.581
in only one cute little night.

08:52.672 --> 08:54.981
lf there was milk and cookies there
waiting for me

08:55.072 --> 08:57.745
l'd be flyin' all over the place myself.

09:00.472 --> 09:03.509
Ludwig. Have you been
in the cookie jar again?

09:03.592 --> 09:07.665
Not now, Mommy.
l'm doing my little science demonstration.

09:07.752 --> 09:09.788
What was l talking about?
Oh, yes.

09:09.872 --> 09:12.386
Santa Claus is getting everywhere so fast

09:12.472 --> 09:18.069
because he is driving this turbo-charged
Santa sleigh with dual toy bags.

09:18.152 --> 09:22.543
This buggy goes so fast that Santa can be
in more than one place at the same time.

09:22.632 --> 09:23.826
Hello there.

09:23.912 --> 09:27.302
Look what l brought for me -
the cookie jar.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.952
- Ludwig.
- Quick. Step on it.

09:31.872 --> 09:35.865
OK, admit it. Hearing all about Santa
had to help put you in the Christmas spirit.

09:35.952 --> 09:39.831
- Right, Donald?
- Nothing seems to be working.

09:40.592 --> 09:42.742
Even my trusted pup Pluto
wants to help out.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.062
Well, then, what do you say
we show a story about Pluto?

09:45.152 --> 09:50.067
How about the one where Pluto and l
pick out our Christmas tree together?

10:00.152 --> 10:02.143
OK, Pluto. Let's get our tree.

10:15.672 --> 10:17.663
Hey, get a load of that.

10:41.552 --> 10:45.465
- He'll never find us.
- You're telling me.

10:45.552 --> 10:47.349
- What was that?
- l don't know.

10:52.672 --> 10:53.900
Oh, boy.

10:57.632 --> 10:59.668
OK, Pluto.

11:00.712 --> 11:02.942
All right?

11:03.032 --> 11:05.023
Come on. Let's go.

11:29.712 --> 11:31.703
Hey, wake up.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.941
Well, what do you know?

12:19.672 --> 12:22.061
Well, Pluto, that's it.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.827
Hey. Cut it out.

13:08.752 --> 13:11.107
There. ls that better?

13:18.592 --> 13:21.743
Oh, Pluto.

13:55.192 --> 13:57.752
OK, l'll light the candles.

14:06.432 --> 14:07.945
There.

14:19.312 --> 14:20.631
Thank you.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.263
Let's go.

14:54.912 --> 14:59.349
Pluto. Get out of there. What do you think
you're... Hey, cut it out. Hey, watch out.

15:01.032 --> 15:05.230
You dumb mutt.
Now look what you've done to our...

15:05.312 --> 15:07.826
Pluto. We've got chipmunks in our tree.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.829
Cute little fellows.

15:11.912 --> 15:12.981
Pluto.

15:13.072 --> 15:15.791
After all, it is Christmas.

15:16.272 --> 15:18.467
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

15:18.552 --> 15:20.702
Fa la la la la, la-la, la, la

15:20.792 --> 15:23.101
'Tis the season to be jolly

15:23.192 --> 15:25.069
Fa la la la la, la-la, la, la

15:25.152 --> 15:27.347
Don we now our gay apparel

15:27.432 --> 15:29.662
Fa-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la

15:29.752 --> 15:32.346
Troll the ancient yuletide carol

15:42.072 --> 15:44.063
Gee, that was swell.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.303
lsn't it nice
seeing everybody get along?

15:52.112 --> 15:56.628
Donald, l wish you'd have the Christmas
spirit. You have so much to be thankful for.

15:56.712 --> 16:00.625
- Uh-huh. Like l'm thankful for Mickey.
- And l'm thankful for my new hat.

16:00.712 --> 16:03.465
Say, what's everybody else thankful for?

16:03.552 --> 16:07.101
l'm thankful for friendly mice
who make nice evening wear.

16:08.672 --> 16:11.982
l'm thankful for laughter, joy,

16:12.072 --> 16:17.271
and the high-spirited glee
that fills my heart to overflowing.

16:21.272 --> 16:25.584
All right, all right, people. Listen up.
Mushu's on stage now, so pay attention.

16:25.672 --> 16:27.788
Time to give thanks for the important stuff.

16:27.872 --> 16:30.830
l'd like to thank the Guardian Spirits.
Yeah, you guys, l love ya.

16:30.912 --> 16:34.541
And Mulan for makin' me
a great big movie star.

16:35.632 --> 16:38.590
All right, all right.
Hold your horseflies. l see ya.

16:38.672 --> 16:40.867
l'm thankful for the ''little people'' too.

16:40.952 --> 16:42.544
But we don't even know him.

16:42.632 --> 16:44.668
The one thing l'm thankful for most
is my hat.

16:44.752 --> 16:46.743
All hats, in fact,
if you can believe that.

16:46.832 --> 16:48.788
Hats that are tall, and hats that are small,

16:48.872 --> 16:50.828
and hats that are totally off of the wall.

16:50.912 --> 16:52.948
Hats that are solely for use by Stromboli,

16:53.032 --> 16:55.341
and hats which are made up of
giant broccoli.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.662
l'm grateful for hats
of all shapes and all sizes,

16:57.752 --> 17:01.188
but l love my hat best
cos it's full of surprises.

17:03.792 --> 17:07.387
There now, Donald. You see? There's
lots of reasons to have the Christmas spirit.

17:07.472 --> 17:08.905
Aw, l don't know.

17:08.992 --> 17:12.064
Now, why don't you take a look
at how l decorated my house today?

17:12.152 --> 17:13.904
Jingle those bells, boys.

18:14.272 --> 18:15.864
Mickey. Look.

18:15.952 --> 18:19.501
Aw. The Nutcracker.
Why, even Donald's gonna love that.

18:19.592 --> 18:22.231
Now here's a Christmas story
with a new twist.

18:22.312 --> 18:26.669
And it was made all the sweeter
because of my Mickey.

18:26.752 --> 18:27.548
Gosh.

18:29.272 --> 18:33.743
lt is December 24th,
Christmas Eve.

18:34.792 --> 18:39.024
Young Maria has been waiting all day
for this moment.

18:39.112 --> 18:42.582
lt's so beautiful.

18:43.432 --> 18:45.423
Christmas is here.

18:45.952 --> 18:49.627
Everything shone and glittered
in the loveliest manner.

18:49.712 --> 18:53.148
Who - oh, who - could describe them all?

18:53.232 --> 18:54.381
l can.

18:54.472 --> 18:57.066
Now, this here is a nice little dolly.

18:57.152 --> 19:00.064
And here's a kooky cuckoo clock.

19:00.152 --> 19:02.825
And look. lt's a choo-choo train.

19:05.552 --> 19:07.986
Excuse me. l am trying to narrate.

19:08.072 --> 19:11.781
Well, you said you wanted someone
to describe all of this stuff here.

19:11.872 --> 19:15.626
That was a rhetorical question.
Pretend like l'm not here.

19:15.712 --> 19:18.465
How do you expect me
to ignore a big, booming voice

19:18.552 --> 19:21.624
- that's blabbedy-blabbering all the time?
- Just ignore me.

19:21.712 --> 19:24.101
All right, have it your way.

19:24.192 --> 19:27.264
Somebody could use
a little istmas-Chray irit-spay.

19:28.272 --> 19:32.868
This year, Godpapa Drosselmeier
had made a special gift for young Maria.

19:32.952 --> 19:35.830
All right, little one.
Now, this took me all...

19:35.912 --> 19:38.631
lt had taken him all year to build.

19:38.712 --> 19:40.942
Right. All year.

19:41.032 --> 19:45.025
- lt's a beautiful...
- A beautiful nutcracker doll.

19:45.112 --> 19:49.105
Aw, you're no narrator.
You're just a great big surprise-spoiler.

19:49.192 --> 19:51.865
- lgnore me and just give her the doll.
- Fine, fine.

19:51.952 --> 19:54.750
All right.
Here's the no-longer-a-surprise nutcracker.

19:54.832 --> 19:56.823
Take it already.

19:56.912 --> 19:58.789
He's so handsome.

19:58.872 --> 20:02.581
Thank you. You know,
l have been taking care of myself.

20:02.672 --> 20:05.664
l've been doing some jogging
and weightlifting and...

20:05.752 --> 20:10.621
You're talking about the doll.
Yeah, he's cute too.

21:11.632 --> 21:15.147
l just love it.
Thank you, Godpapa Drosselmeier.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.508
Wait a minute.
He's not supposed to dance.

21:18.592 --> 21:21.470
Must be a loose cogwheel
in here somewhere.

21:21.552 --> 21:23.349
You broke him.

21:23.432 --> 21:27.903
Right. Just for that,
l'm kicking you out of the story.

21:30.192 --> 21:32.865
l'll take the greatest care of you

21:32.952 --> 21:36.547
and nurse you till you're quite better
and happy again.

21:36.632 --> 21:39.305
There.
Just as handsome as ever.

21:39.392 --> 21:43.624
lf only you were real,
l could dance with you.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.464
Maria thought
she saw the Nutcracker smile.

21:48.552 --> 21:51.942
Perhaps it was a trick of the light,
perhaps something else.

22:16.912 --> 22:21.224
Maria, l want to thank you
for your kindness.

22:21.312 --> 22:23.621
Maria was no longer frightened.

22:23.712 --> 22:26.101
ln the twinkling of the Christmas lights,

22:26.192 --> 22:30.071
her beloved Nutcracker looked
more handsome and dashing than ever.

23:27.032 --> 23:30.991
Suddenly there began
a sort of wild kickering and squeaking,

23:31.072 --> 23:33.347
loudly and all about.

23:34.312 --> 23:38.430
My God. lt's...
lt's... the Mouse King.

23:38.512 --> 23:42.710
l don't wanna be the Mouse King.
This is ridiculous.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.509
Bye-bye.

23:45.592 --> 23:49.267
Wait. Donald.
You know the Mouse King wins.

23:49.352 --> 23:51.343
- He does?
- Yes, yes.

23:51.432 --> 23:55.141
The Mouse King wins in the end.
You get the girl.

23:55.232 --> 23:58.986
Oh boy, oh boy. l'll do it.

23:59.872 --> 24:04.263
The Mouse King - who will win
in the end - had come for Maria.

24:04.352 --> 24:06.582
He wanted her to be his queen.

24:06.672 --> 24:09.391
Don't worry. l'll protect you.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.983
Oh, no.

24:35.752 --> 24:38.630
Something screwy going on here.

24:38.712 --> 24:41.545
- Heya, Mickey.
- Goofy. What are you doing here?

24:41.632 --> 24:44.021
- You're not in The Nutcracker.
- l am now.

24:44.112 --> 24:47.946
- But what are you supposed to be?
- l be helpin' ya.

24:48.032 --> 24:50.785
No, no.
What role are you playing?

24:52.392 --> 24:53.791
Hamlet?

24:53.872 --> 24:56.784
- Can l get a little help here?
- Nope. l'm staying out of this one.

24:56.872 --> 24:59.944
Goofy, what role are you playing
from The Nutcracker?.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.068
Right.

25:02.152 --> 25:04.302
l'll be the Magical Snow Fairy

25:04.392 --> 25:08.431
who can instantly transport you
to the evil Mouse King's hidden kingdom.

25:08.512 --> 25:09.945
Now you're talking.

25:12.952 --> 25:14.431
Let's go.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.389
Right. Here we go.

25:27.472 --> 25:31.181
The Mouse King, played by Donald Duck -
and who will win in the end -

25:31.272 --> 25:34.708
was attempting to crown Minnie -
l mean Maria -

25:34.792 --> 25:38.705
as his duck - mouse - queen,
or something like that.

25:38.792 --> 25:41.864
- Hold still, will you?
- No. Never.

25:41.952 --> 25:45.547
You heard the little lady.
Let her go, you mousey monarch.

26:47.392 --> 26:49.383
My Nutcracker.

26:51.912 --> 26:54.551
And so they made their escape,
except for Goofy -

26:54.632 --> 26:59.183
l mean, the Magical Snow Fairy,
who was captured by... Donald?

26:59.272 --> 27:01.149
No. No, the Mouse King.

27:01.232 --> 27:03.223
You get the idea.

27:06.272 --> 27:07.785
Arriving safely at home,

27:07.872 --> 27:12.070
the Nutcracker and Maria sought to close
the way to the Mouse King's world.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.222
But they'd forgotten about

27:14.312 --> 27:16.223
the train.

28:23.392 --> 28:27.021
Donald the Mouse King
was stopped by Mickey the Nutcracker

28:27.112 --> 28:30.229
and trapped in his own sceptre.

28:30.312 --> 28:33.031
You said l would win.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.068
Sorry. l made a mistake.

28:36.232 --> 28:38.223
l got card games.

28:39.912 --> 28:41.630
Oh, no.

28:41.712 --> 28:45.261
Go on, Donald.
Pick a card. Any card.

28:56.952 --> 28:59.147
And so Minnie - l mean Maria -

28:59.232 --> 29:03.783
and her handsome Nutcracker,
played by Mickey, lived happily ever...

29:03.872 --> 29:07.501
- Thank you for getting this back to me.
- l thought you were gone.

29:07.592 --> 29:10.948
Oh, no.
l just needed to get my sceptre back.

29:11.032 --> 29:15.822
- Your sceptre?
- Yes. This little fellow in here usurped me.

29:15.912 --> 29:19.746
Now that l got it back,
l can resume my royal duties

29:19.832 --> 29:22.585
as the King of the Sugar Plum Fairies.

29:22.672 --> 29:26.585
Now, really. You are not
the King of the Sugar Plum Fairies.

29:26.672 --> 29:28.867
l sure am.

29:28.952 --> 29:31.546
Come on, little guys, let's go.

29:32.672 --> 29:35.664
And that, my dear friends,
ends the tale of the Nutcracker

29:35.752 --> 29:38.949
and Goofy
and the Duck King of the Mice and...

29:39.032 --> 29:43.071
l have no idea what that Sugar Plum Fairy
nonsense had to do with any of it.

29:43.152 --> 29:45.143
l'm outta here.

29:47.232 --> 29:50.224
This is turning out to be
a wonderful Christmas.

29:50.312 --> 29:52.109
We finished our house.

29:52.192 --> 29:53.864
l knew Mickey wouldn't let us down.

29:55.192 --> 29:58.502
lt's good to see that a merry Christmas
is being had by all.

29:58.592 --> 30:01.311
So, Donald, you feelin' jolly yet?

30:01.392 --> 30:03.542
l say

30:03.632 --> 30:05.907
humbug.

30:08.352 --> 30:10.627
l did everything l could think of.

30:10.712 --> 30:13.431
l guess Donald's just never gonna have
the Christmas spirit.

30:24.792 --> 30:26.384
Why so glum, Mickey?

30:26.472 --> 30:30.260
Well, l wanted to throw a party and
make it a merry Christmas for everybody,

30:30.352 --> 30:32.308
but my good pal Donald's missing out.

30:32.392 --> 30:35.509
Now, Mickey, the Christmas spirit
doesn't come from a party.

30:35.592 --> 30:38.902
lt comes from sharing the holidays
with family and friends.

30:38.992 --> 30:43.782
And it seems to me that Donald has
the best friend anyone could want - in you.

30:43.872 --> 30:49.071
Gee, l guess you're right. And all l wish is
for everyone to have a merry Christmas,

30:49.152 --> 30:50.790
even that humbug Donald.

30:50.872 --> 30:53.102
Well, haven't you ever
wished upon a star?

30:53.192 --> 30:56.502
Your dreams just might come true.

30:57.032 --> 31:01.423
Gosh. l wish that, home or away,
with family or friends,

31:01.512 --> 31:05.425
whether you've got the fanciest decorations
or the humblest little tree,

31:05.512 --> 31:08.504
that... that everyone could have
the Christmas spirit.

31:19.232 --> 31:20.904
Gosh.

31:21.672 --> 31:24.869
- Say, Donald...
- What do you want?

31:24.952 --> 31:28.831
Well, l want my best friend
to put the star on the tree.

31:28.912 --> 31:30.903
You want me to do it?

31:30.992 --> 31:32.789
Aw, you bet l do.

31:38.912 --> 31:40.868
Merry Christmas.

31:53.592 --> 31:54.786
lt's magical.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.990
Pretty.

32:15.014 --> 32:22.014
...:::Lord Sadler:::...
lordsadler2012@gmail.com

32:23.752 --> 32:26.391
That old star never lets you down.

32:26.472 --> 32:28.463
Now, before we sing our Christmas carol,

32:28.552 --> 32:30.907
l wanna share one of my favourite
Christmas stories

32:30.992 --> 32:33.142
with Donald and all my friends.

32:45.672 --> 32:50.666
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to one and all.

32:50.752 --> 32:54.791
Give a penny for the poor, governor?
Penny for the poor?

33:00.432 --> 33:02.229
My partner Jacob Marley.

33:02.312 --> 33:04.746
Dead seven years today.

33:04.832 --> 33:10.589
He was a good 'un. He robbed
from the widows and swindled the poor.

33:11.272 --> 33:14.389
ln his will he left me enough money
to pay for his tombstone.

33:14.472 --> 33:17.544
And l had him buried at sea.

33:22.632 --> 33:25.146
Good morning, Mr Scrooge.

33:25.232 --> 33:27.826
Cratchit. What are you doing
with that piece of coal?

33:27.912 --> 33:32.542
l was... just trying to thaw out the ink.

33:34.072 --> 33:35.869
You used a piece last week.

33:37.632 --> 33:40.669
Now, get on with your work, Cratchit.

33:41.472 --> 33:44.828
Speaking of work, Mr Scrooge,
tomorrow is Christmas,

33:44.912 --> 33:49.906
and l was wondering if
l could have half a day off?

33:49.992 --> 33:52.187
Christmas, eh? Well...

33:54.232 --> 33:58.225
l suppose so,
but l'll dock you half a day's pay.

33:58.312 --> 34:02.351
Now, let's see.
l pay you two shillings a day...

34:02.432 --> 34:05.026
Two shillings and a ha'penny, sir.

34:05.112 --> 34:08.467
Oh, yes. l gave you that raise
three years ago.

34:08.552 --> 34:11.464
Yes, sir. When l started doing
your laundry.

34:11.552 --> 34:14.942
All right, Cratchit.
Get busy while l go over my books.

34:15.032 --> 34:19.867
And here.
Here's another bundle of shirts for you.

34:19.952 --> 34:21.829
Yes, sir.

34:24.232 --> 34:28.828
Let's see, now.
50 pounds, ten shillings from McDuff.

34:28.911 --> 34:32.621
Plus his 80% interest, compounded daily.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.862
Money, money, money.

34:37.871 --> 34:39.828
Merry Christmas.

34:39.911 --> 34:43.063
And a merry Christmas to you,
Master Fred.

34:43.152 --> 34:44.551
Bah, humbug.

34:44.632 --> 34:47.987
Merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.

34:48.072 --> 34:49.902
What's so merry about it?

34:49.992 --> 34:53.268
l'll tell you what Christmas is:
it's just another work day,

34:53.351 --> 34:57.630
and any jackanapes who thinks else
should be boiled in his own pudding.

34:59.232 --> 35:04.431
But, sir, Christmas is a time for giving.
A time to be with one's family.

35:04.512 --> 35:06.423
l say ''Bah, humbug.''

35:06.512 --> 35:11.711
l don't care. l say ''Merry Christmas.''
Merry Christmas.

35:11.792 --> 35:13.669
Well said, Master Fred.

35:13.752 --> 35:15.743
Cratchit. What are you doing?

35:17.672 --> 35:21.551
l was just trying
to keep my hands warm, sir.

35:22.952 --> 35:24.783
And what are you doing here, nephew?

35:24.872 --> 35:29.946
l've come to give you a wreath
and invite you to Christmas dinner.

35:30.032 --> 35:31.909
Well.

35:31.992 --> 35:35.382
l suppose you're going to have
plump goose with chestnut dressing?

35:35.472 --> 35:38.589
- Yeah.
- And plum pudding and lemon sauce?

35:38.672 --> 35:40.469
Yeah. Boy, oh, boy.

35:40.552 --> 35:42.747
And candied fruits
with spiced sugar cakes?

35:42.832 --> 35:44.504
Yeah. Will you come?

35:44.592 --> 35:48.346
Are you daft, man?
You know l can't eat that stuff.

35:48.432 --> 35:51.105
Here's your wreath back. Now out, out, out.

35:53.112 --> 35:55.387
Bah. Humbug.

35:55.992 --> 35:58.028
Merry Christmas.

35:58.912 --> 36:00.948
And a ''bah, humbug'' to you.

36:01.952 --> 36:04.591
That Fred.
Always so full of kindness.

36:04.672 --> 36:08.267
Aye, he always was a little peculiar.

36:08.352 --> 36:10.343
And stubborn.

36:13.032 --> 36:16.627
Customers. l'll handle this, Cratchit.

36:16.712 --> 36:19.909
Yes, what can l do
for you two gentlemen?

36:19.992 --> 36:23.951
Sir, we are soliciting funds
for the indigent and destitute.

36:24.032 --> 36:25.829
For the what?

36:25.912 --> 36:27.982
We're collecting for the poor.

36:31.112 --> 36:34.422
Well, you realise
if you give money to the poor,

36:34.512 --> 36:37.265
- they won't be poor any more, will they?
- Well...

36:37.352 --> 36:38.990
And if they're not poor any more,

36:39.072 --> 36:41.666
then you won't have to
raise money for them any more.

36:41.752 --> 36:42.787
Well, l suppose...

36:42.872 --> 36:46.308
And if you don't have to
raise money for them any more,

36:46.392 --> 36:48.542
then you would be out of a job.

36:48.632 --> 36:52.591
Please, gentlemen,
don't ask me to put you out of a job.

36:52.672 --> 36:56.108
- Not on Christmas Eve.
- We wouldn't do that, Mr Scrooge.

36:56.192 --> 37:01.186
Well, then, l suggest you give this
to the poor and be gone.

37:05.752 --> 37:08.550
What's this world coming to, Cratchit?

37:09.312 --> 37:14.670
You work all your life to get money,
and people want you to give it away.

37:34.592 --> 37:36.787
Two minutes fast.

37:40.192 --> 37:43.662
Well, never mind those two minutes.
You may go now.

37:43.752 --> 37:47.028
Thank you, sir. You're so kind.

37:47.112 --> 37:49.467
Never mind the mushy stuff.
Just go.

37:49.552 --> 37:51.986
But be here all the earlier the next day.

37:52.072 --> 37:54.950
l will. l will, sir. And a ''bah, humbug...''

37:56.232 --> 37:59.304
l mean, a merry Christmas to you, sir.

38:46.712 --> 38:50.830
Scrooge.

38:52.192 --> 38:56.390
Jacob Marley? No, that can't be.

39:00.992 --> 39:02.664
Gosh.

39:51.512 --> 39:56.427
Ebenezer Scrooge.

39:56.512 --> 39:58.423
Go away.

39:59.232 --> 40:02.941
Ebenezer Scrooge...

40:08.712 --> 40:10.543
Gosh. Kind of slippery.

40:13.872 --> 40:16.466
Scrooge, don't you recognise me?

40:16.552 --> 40:19.589
l was your partner, Jacob Marley.

40:21.592 --> 40:24.470
Marley. lt is you.

40:25.112 --> 40:27.831
Ebenezer, remember when l was alive

40:27.912 --> 40:30.585
l robbed the widows
and swindled the poor?

40:30.672 --> 40:35.541
Yes, and all in the same day.
You had class, Jacob.

40:35.632 --> 40:36.621
Yep.

40:36.712 --> 40:39.545
No. No. l was wrong.

40:39.632 --> 40:45.821
And so, as punishment, l'm forced to carry
these heavy chains through eternity.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.068
Maybe even longer.

40:49.152 --> 40:53.668
There's no hope. l'm doomed. Doomed.

40:53.752 --> 40:59.031
And the same thing will happen to you,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

40:59.112 --> 41:04.027
No. No, it can't. lt mustn't.
Help me, Jacob.

41:04.112 --> 41:07.900
Tonight you will be visited
by three spirits.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.351
Listen to them. Do what they say.

41:11.432 --> 41:14.310
Or your chains will be heavier than mine.

41:15.072 --> 41:18.064
Farewell, Ebenezer.

41:23.472 --> 41:26.430
Farewell...

41:26.512 --> 41:28.980
Marley. Watch out for that first

41:33.752 --> 41:36.141
step.

41:50.952 --> 41:53.307
Spirits.

41:57.392 --> 41:59.383
Humbug.

42:17.792 --> 42:20.306
What, what, what?

42:25.832 --> 42:27.823
What...?

42:27.912 --> 42:32.064
Well. lt's about time.
Haven't got all night, you know.

42:32.152 --> 42:34.302
Who... Who are you?

42:34.392 --> 42:37.031
Why, l'm the Ghost of Christmas Past.

42:40.672 --> 42:43.027
l thought you'd be taller.

42:43.112 --> 42:45.865
Listen, Scrooge,
if men were measured by kindness,

42:45.952 --> 42:48.944
you'd be no bigger than a speck of dust.

42:50.992 --> 42:54.143
Kindness is of little use in this world.

42:54.232 --> 42:56.063
You didn't always think so.

42:56.152 --> 42:59.303
- Come on, Scrooge, it's time to go.
- Then go.

43:04.672 --> 43:07.470
Spirit. What... what are you doing?

43:07.552 --> 43:09.508
We're gonna visit your past.

43:09.592 --> 43:13.107
l'm not going out there. l'll fall.

43:13.192 --> 43:14.989
Just hold on.

43:16.192 --> 43:18.183
Not too tight, now.

43:24.192 --> 43:26.183
Spirit, look out.

43:32.672 --> 43:34.663
What's wrong, Scrooge?

43:34.752 --> 43:38.745
l thought you enjoyed
looking down on the world.

43:46.752 --> 43:49.869
Spirit, l believe l know this place.

43:49.952 --> 43:52.944
Yes. lt's old Fezzywig's.

43:53.992 --> 43:57.268
l couldn't have worked for a kinder man.

44:04.072 --> 44:06.540
Why, it's old Fezzywig himself.

44:06.632 --> 44:09.829
And all of my very dearest friends.

44:14.592 --> 44:18.505
And that shy lad in the corner, that's me.

44:19.432 --> 44:24.631
Yes. That was before you became
a miserable miser, consumed by greed.

44:24.712 --> 44:26.350
Well, nobody's perfect.

44:26.432 --> 44:30.311
And there. There's lovely lsabelle.

44:32.592 --> 44:34.389
Ebenezer?

44:34.472 --> 44:37.066
- Ebenezer?
- Yes, lsabelle?

44:37.152 --> 44:39.985
My eyes are closed,
my lips are puckered,

44:40.072 --> 44:43.064
and l'm standing under the mistletoe.

44:43.512 --> 44:46.106
You're also standing on my foot.

45:10.872 --> 45:14.262
l remember how much
l was in love with her.

45:15.672 --> 45:18.744
ln ten years' time
you learned to love something else.

45:18.832 --> 45:21.505
Why... why, it's my counting house.

45:21.592 --> 45:25.380
Nine thousand, nine hundred
and seventy-two, nine thousand...

45:25.472 --> 45:27.463
Ebenezer.

45:27.552 --> 45:29.588
Yes, what is it?

45:29.672 --> 45:33.347
For years l've had this
honeymoon cottage, Ebenezer.

45:33.432 --> 45:36.742
l've been waiting for you
to keep your promise to marry me.

45:36.832 --> 45:40.507
Now l must know:
have you made your decision?

45:40.592 --> 45:44.187
l have. Your last payment
on the cottage was an hour late.

45:44.272 --> 45:46.832
l'm foreclosing the mortgage.

45:51.552 --> 45:55.022
You loved your gold
more than that precious creature,

45:55.112 --> 45:57.228
and you lost her forever.

45:57.312 --> 46:00.941
Nine thousand, nine hundred, seventy-

46:03.032 --> 46:04.226
three.

46:05.072 --> 46:09.907
Please, Spirit, l can no longer bear
these memories. Take me home.

46:09.992 --> 46:15.066
Remember, Scrooge,
you fashioned these memories yourself.

46:20.272 --> 46:24.663
Why was l so foolish? Why? Why?

46:25.792 --> 46:27.783
What's this?

46:27.872 --> 46:31.069
Fee. Fi. Fo.

46:31.152 --> 46:33.347
Fum. l smell...

46:33.432 --> 46:35.821
l mean, l smell

46:38.512 --> 46:41.106
a stingy little Englishman.

46:41.832 --> 46:43.823
l think l do.

46:44.672 --> 46:47.061
Yeah, l do.

46:47.152 --> 46:49.985
Please, let me go. Don't eat me.

46:50.432 --> 46:54.027
Why would the Ghost of
Christmas Present - that's me -

46:54.112 --> 46:57.309
want to eat a distasteful
little miser like you?

46:57.392 --> 47:03.581
Especially when there are so many
good things to enjoy in life. See?

47:03.672 --> 47:05.663
Mince pies.

47:05.752 --> 47:09.381
Turkeys. Suckling pig.

47:09.472 --> 47:13.181
And don't forget the chocolate pot roast
with ''pisnachio''.

47:13.272 --> 47:14.910
Duh, with ''pisnachio''.

47:14.992 --> 47:16.903
Duh, with...

47:16.992 --> 47:18.789
With yogurt.

47:18.872 --> 47:20.942
But where did all this come from?

47:21.032 --> 47:23.148
From the heart, Scrooge.

47:24.552 --> 47:29.262
lt's the food of generosity, which
you have long denied your fellow man.

47:29.352 --> 47:31.343
Generosity, ha.

47:32.912 --> 47:35.631
Nobody has ever shown me generosity.

47:35.712 --> 47:38.749
You've never given them reason to.

47:40.152 --> 47:42.188
And yet

47:42.272 --> 47:45.548
there are some who still find
enough warmth in their hearts

47:45.632 --> 47:47.350
even for the likes of you.

47:48.392 --> 47:51.987
No acquaintance of mine,
l assure you.

47:52.072 --> 47:53.983
Duh, you'll see.

48:22.312 --> 48:24.621
Duh, here we are.

48:27.592 --> 48:30.390
Why did you bring me to this old shack?

48:30.472 --> 48:36.342
This is the home of your overworked,
underpaid employee, Bob Cratchit.

48:38.432 --> 48:40.423
What's she cooking? A canary?

48:40.512 --> 48:43.231
Surely they have more food than that?

48:43.312 --> 48:44.984
Look on the fire.

48:45.072 --> 48:48.030
Duh, what? Oh, that's your laundry.

48:50.352 --> 48:53.583
Not yet, children.
We must wait for Tiny Tim.

48:53.672 --> 48:56.470
Coming, Father. l'm coming.

49:02.712 --> 49:06.500
Oh, my. Look at all
the wonderful things to eat.

49:08.392 --> 49:11.907
We must thank Mr Scrooge.

49:11.992 --> 49:15.985
Tell me, Spirit,
what's wrong with that kind lad?

49:16.072 --> 49:20.463
Much, l'm afraid.
lf these shadows remain unchanged,

49:20.552 --> 49:25.068
l see an empty chair
where Tiny Tim once sat.

49:28.112 --> 49:30.751
Then that means

49:30.832 --> 49:32.629
Tim will...?

49:32.712 --> 49:34.782
Where did they go?

49:34.872 --> 49:36.669
Spirit. Where are you?

49:37.072 --> 49:40.303
Don't go.
You must tell me about Tim.

49:40.992 --> 49:43.187
Don't go.

49:48.232 --> 49:50.507
Where did...?

49:54.232 --> 49:56.621
Who are you?

49:57.752 --> 50:00.949
Are you the Ghost of Christmas Future?

50:02.992 --> 50:05.062
Please, speak to me.

50:05.152 --> 50:09.703
Tell me, what will happen to Tiny Tim?

50:34.192 --> 50:36.183
Oh, no.

50:36.272 --> 50:38.945
Spirit, l didn't want this to happen.

50:39.032 --> 50:42.024
Tell me these events can yet be changed.

50:45.992 --> 50:48.904
l've never seen a funeral like this one.

50:48.992 --> 50:52.780
Aye. No mourners,
no friends to bid him farewell.

50:52.872 --> 50:56.501
Oh, well. Let's rest a minute
before we fill it in, eh?

50:56.592 --> 50:58.662
He ain't going nowheres.

51:07.312 --> 51:12.466
Spirit, whose lonely grave is this?

51:16.112 --> 51:18.501
Why, yours, Ebenezer.

51:18.592 --> 51:22.141
The richest man in the cemetery.

51:22.232 --> 51:23.790
Please.

51:30.312 --> 51:32.667
No, no, no. No. No.

51:39.072 --> 51:43.111
l'll change. l'll change. l'll change.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.149
Spirit. Let me out.

51:47.232 --> 51:49.985
Let me out. l'll...

51:50.072 --> 51:51.903
What...?

51:51.992 --> 51:54.142
l'm back in my own room.

51:58.912 --> 52:02.427
lt's Christmas morning. l haven't missed it.

52:02.512 --> 52:05.982
The spirits have given me another chance.

52:06.072 --> 52:10.668
l know just what l'll do.
They'll be so surprised.

52:12.112 --> 52:14.342
What a wonderful day.

52:14.432 --> 52:18.505
Oh, there's so much to do.
Oh, so much to do.

52:23.632 --> 52:25.907
l can't go out like this.

52:26.632 --> 52:29.305
There. That's better.

52:31.752 --> 52:34.471
Merry Christmas to one and all.

52:37.672 --> 52:41.062
Well, bless me.
Good morning, gentlemen.

52:41.152 --> 52:43.143
l have something for you.

52:44.872 --> 52:48.228
20 gold sovereigns? Oh, no.

52:48.312 --> 52:50.826
Not enough? Well, all right.

52:50.912 --> 52:53.380
50 gold sovereigns.

52:53.472 --> 52:56.748
- Really, Mr Scrooge, it's...
- Still not enough?

52:56.832 --> 52:59.141
Aye. You drive a hard bargain.

52:59.232 --> 53:03.828
Here ya are.
1 00 gold pieces, and not a penny more.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.866
Thank you, Mr Scrooge.
Thank you.

53:07.952 --> 53:10.864
And a merry Christmas to you.

53:12.512 --> 53:16.471
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

53:20.312 --> 53:22.268
Ah, nephew.

53:22.352 --> 53:24.183
Uncle Scrooge.

53:24.272 --> 53:27.742
l'm looking forward to
that wonderful meal of yours.

53:27.832 --> 53:31.142
Well, l'll be doggone.
You mean you're coming?

53:31.232 --> 53:37.023
Of course l am. You know how much l like
candied fruits with spiced sugar cakes.

53:37.112 --> 53:40.582
l'll be over promptly at two.
Keep it piping hot.

53:40.672 --> 53:43.311
l will, Uncle Scrooge. l will.

53:43.392 --> 53:46.623
And a very merry Christmas to you.

53:47.912 --> 53:51.746
Merry Christmas.
And keep the change.

53:51.832 --> 53:53.823
Wonderful lads.

53:54.672 --> 53:57.140
And now for Cratchit.

54:04.632 --> 54:08.784
Why, Mr Scrooge.
Merry Christmas.

54:08.872 --> 54:12.467
- Won't you come in?
- Merry Christmas.

54:12.552 --> 54:14.782
l have another bundle for you.

54:16.832 --> 54:18.868
But, sir, it's Christmas day.

54:18.952 --> 54:24.470
Christmas day indeed.
Just another excuse for being lazy.

54:24.552 --> 54:29.262
And another thing, Cratchit.
l've had enough of this ''half-day off'' stuff.

54:29.352 --> 54:31.820
You leave me no alternative

54:31.912 --> 54:33.743
but to give you...

54:33.832 --> 54:34.821
Toys.

54:34.912 --> 54:37.790
Yes, toys. No, no, no, no, no.

54:37.872 --> 54:40.022
l'm giving you a raise

54:40.112 --> 54:42.103
and making you my partner.

54:42.192 --> 54:44.183
A partner?

54:45.632 --> 54:47.907
Thank you, Mr Scrooge.

54:47.992 --> 54:49.630
Merry Christmas, Bob.

54:49.712 --> 54:53.148
And God bless us, every one.

55:26.272 --> 55:31.585
Here we are,
warm and cosy by the fire's glow

55:33.672 --> 55:40.271
Singing songs
and stealing kisses under the mistletoe

55:41.112 --> 55:44.707
- We finished our feast
- Have the tastiest treats

55:44.792 --> 55:48.421
But the spirit of Christmas
just isn't complete

55:48.512 --> 55:52.221
Without true friends and family

55:52.312 --> 55:56.146
And the memories we recall

55:56.232 --> 56:00.305
It's the love we share that fills the air

56:00.392 --> 56:06.547
And makes this the best Christmas of all

56:07.512 --> 56:11.630
Something special underneath the tree

56:11.712 --> 56:15.307
We hope it fits you perfectly

56:15.392 --> 56:19.226
I'm making a wish on a sparkling light

56:19.312 --> 56:24.670
But that's not what makes this
a magical night

56:24.752 --> 56:28.506
It's our true friends and family

56:28.592 --> 56:32.585
And the memories we recall

56:32.672 --> 56:36.221
It's the love we share that fills the air

56:36.312 --> 56:40.669
And makes this the best Christmas of all

56:40.752 --> 56:43.789
It's good friends and warm wishes

56:43.872 --> 56:47.421
That makes this the best...

56:47.512 --> 56:50.504
The best.

56:50.592 --> 56:56.110
..Christmas of all

56:56.952 --> 57:00.831
Gee, thanks for letting us share
our Christmas spirit with you.

57:00.912 --> 57:03.380
Merry Christmas, everybody.

57:03.404 --> 57:23.404
