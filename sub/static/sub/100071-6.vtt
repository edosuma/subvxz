WEBVTT

00:04.471 --> 00:06.473
What, too soon?

00:10.911 --> 00:12.346
(exclaims)

00:17.985 --> 00:20.153
(school bell rings)

00:21.555 --> 00:22.556
(belches)

00:22.956 --> 00:25.492
(work whistle blows)

00:25.559 --> 00:27.361
Aah!

00:31.832 --> 00:33.734
(scanner beeps)

00:35.969 --> 00:37.137
(tires screech)

00:38.872 --> 00:40.908
D'oh!

00:40.974 --> 00:42.676
(grunts)

00:45.512 --> 00:46.680
Avast there.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.982
It be too late
to alter course, matey.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.019
And there be pirates
lurking in every cove.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.020
Get to the ride.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.388
(all screaming)

00:56.523 --> 00:58.625
Did they get a picture?

01:05.332 --> 01:09.102
Welcome to our first‐ever night
of dramatic scenes

01:09.169 --> 01:11.071
written by our students.

01:11.138 --> 01:14.341
Should we silence
our cell phones and pagers?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.943
No, no, no, please,
I beg you, leave them on.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.111
An‐And here‐here's some candy
to unwrap.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.180
(audience exclaiming)

01:20.247 --> 01:24.084
And now, an new scene
from the CW's <i>Riverdale.</i>

01:24.151 --> 01:25.953
(students cheer)

01:26.019 --> 01:28.989
Jughead, there's been a murder
at Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe

01:29.056 --> 01:31.391
and it's up to us kids
to solve it.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.393
I can't deal with that
right now.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.963
My dad's in jail
and the only way to get him out

01:36.029 --> 01:37.965
is to try drugs.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.068
We're both pregnant
with Big Moose's babies.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.974
Wait. So this is a play
based on a YouTube

01:47.040 --> 01:49.409
of kids playing a video game?

01:49.476 --> 01:51.979
‐That's right.
‐(scoffs) It's about time.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.915
Okay, to get their chug jugs,
I could snipe these guys out

01:54.982 --> 01:58.085
one by one, but the smarter move
is to plant a charge

01:58.151 --> 01:59.886
at the base of their
attack platform

01:59.953 --> 02:01.688
and skull‐splat 'em
when they land.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.957
Hey, guys, if you want more
game hacks like this,

02:04.024 --> 02:07.794
be sure to smash our like button
and subscribe to our channel.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.364
Up next, night vision fails.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.832
How is this a play?

02:11.898 --> 02:13.333
Well, sir, video game
walk‐throughs

02:13.400 --> 02:16.136
are the only narrative most of
these kids have been exposed to.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.905
‐This is their <i>Becket.</i>
‐BOTH: Who?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.874
Are you Terry Bradshaw?

02:20.941 --> 02:24.011
No. It's, uh, Donny Osmond.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.246
Boner. Boner from <i>Growing Pains.</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:29.349
(distorted): You're all wrong.
My real identity is...

02:29.416 --> 02:30.884
Flavor Flav!

02:30.951 --> 02:33.387
Flavor Flav? I've heard of you.

02:33.453 --> 02:35.222
I've heard of you so much.

02:35.288 --> 02:38.859
I am such a huge fan
of your movies, books, or music.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.094
I can also pretend
to be impressed.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.562
ALL:
The end.

02:42.629 --> 02:43.764
(scattered applause)

02:43.830 --> 02:46.299
Wake up.
Lisa's next.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.636
Oh, no, please.
I'm having the best dream.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.439
I was in my warm, cozy grave.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.776
Well, I'm gonna dream about me
in a soft, cuddly crypt.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.379
‐Yeah...
‐Ah...

02:59.446 --> 03:02.315
Amazingly, this next piece
is not based on something

03:02.382 --> 03:04.017
you watch on your phone
or a gas pump,

03:04.084 --> 03:06.053
but is actually
an honest‐to‐goodness play,

03:06.119 --> 03:08.955
by Lisa "Thank God
You're a Throwback" Simpson.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.290
And so I give you

03:10.357 --> 03:12.926
<i>Long Day's Journey</i>
<i>Into Light Beer.</i>

03:12.993 --> 03:15.896
Where's my beer, Marjorie?

03:15.962 --> 03:19.700
I spent all day making sure
this beer was cold.

03:19.766 --> 03:23.236
Aah!
I make bad choices.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.205
Lisa's really nailed
the Hibberts.

03:25.272 --> 03:26.640
(chuckles)

03:26.707 --> 03:28.909
Uh, yo, dude, my catchphrases

03:28.975 --> 03:31.978
are as outdated as my slingshot.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.447
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

03:33.513 --> 03:36.783
Oh, Mom, it's so hard being
a straight‐A student

03:36.850 --> 03:39.953
with a social conscience
who writes amazing plays.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.422
The only stable thing
in this house is you,

03:42.489 --> 03:44.958
making every day
the same as the last.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.860
Exactly the same.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.862
Like the coffee maker says,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.630
things will perk up.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.866
I thought you were
the coffee maker.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.268
You can learn a lot
from percolators.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.971
Make the most
of the daily grind.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.041
The mother character
is such a snooze.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.076
Ralph has nothing
to play against.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.078
(gasps)
They think I'm boring.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.280
(gasps)
This play is about us!

04:07.347 --> 04:10.417
Today I decided
to be a race car driver,

04:10.484 --> 04:12.452
so I was, then I quit.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.921
I also have exciting news.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.923
I converted four soap slivers

04:16.990 --> 04:19.326
into practically a new bar.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.295
Is this how the world sees me‐‐
as a...

04:22.362 --> 04:24.498
How do the kids say lame‐o
these days?

04:24.564 --> 04:26.767
We say lame‐o, you lame‐o.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.836
Suck, suck.
And I felt like the ghost

04:29.903 --> 04:31.471
belonging to the fog.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.040
And the fog was the ghost
of the sea.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.642
Suck, suck.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.711
(cheering)

04:39.112 --> 04:40.514
(indistinct chatter)

04:41.715 --> 04:43.550
You really think
I'm that boring?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.052
Lisa, you made someone feel sad,

04:46.119 --> 04:49.356
which is not what a drama about
a family is supposed to do.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.091
Marge, could we get a picture?

04:51.158 --> 04:52.893
Okay.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.995
‐(yawns)
‐(shutter clicks)

04:57.464 --> 04:58.899
So all the generations...

04:58.965 --> 05:01.034
Boring.
They think I'm boring.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.869
I'll show them who's boring.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.339
Now, this morning, Marge Simpson
has insistently volunteered

05:06.406 --> 05:07.674
to read a passage.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.477
She says she's gonna
bring her own spin to it.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.545
(humming a tune)

05:11.611 --> 05:14.881
Now, a reading from John, 18:38,

05:14.948 --> 05:17.350
between Pontius Pilate
and Jesus.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.019
(quietly):
Marge! Marge! Marge!

05:19.085 --> 05:20.887
(exaggerated Italian accent):
Hey‐a Jesus,

05:20.954 --> 05:22.088
what's a matter for you?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.723
You saying youse a king?

05:23.790 --> 05:27.160
(normal voice) He was Roman,
that's why I'm doing the accent.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.895
(man coughs)

05:28.962 --> 05:32.933
Anyhoo, Jesus answered,
and I think it might have gone

05:32.999 --> 05:34.601
something like this.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.937
(imitating Jackie Mason):
I'm not a king, I'm a carpenter.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.338
A Jewish carpenter.

05:38.405 --> 05:41.107
The only thing I nail
are my SATs.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.343
So then, Pontius says
to the elders,

05:43.410 --> 05:46.947
"This‐a Jesus,
he‐a look like a nice‐a guy."

05:47.013 --> 05:48.748
Nobody talk‐a like‐a that.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.183
I make a nice‐a sentence.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.552
Just like‐a Mama
used to construct.

05:52.619 --> 05:56.089
‐Oh...
‐Can we just hear
Lovejoy's sermon, please?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.591
Yeah, Marge, read the room.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.192
Mm...

06:00.760 --> 06:02.829
You need this more
than we do, lady.

06:13.907 --> 06:17.010
Boring. That's what this
straight‐A Girl Scout

06:17.077 --> 06:18.879
has become‐‐ boring.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.780
(thunder crashes)

06:20.847 --> 06:22.682
(screaming)

06:22.749 --> 06:25.919
(gasps) You just had
a near‐death experience.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.120
That's exciting.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.290
Whoo! What a rich life
you lead, Mom.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.159
I'm going to bed.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.463
That will really turn around
your boring reputation.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.598
Shh.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.667
(grunting)

06:51.678 --> 06:53.680
(snoring)

06:59.686 --> 07:02.022
(sighs) Don't worry, Homer,
I'll chop the wood.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.490
Like always.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.725
I have to do everything.
(grunts)

07:05.792 --> 07:07.093
Even chop the trees.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.829
(grunting)

07:09.896 --> 07:11.131
‐Hyah!
‐Whoa!

07:11.197 --> 07:12.899
‐Hyah!
‐(chuckles)

07:12.966 --> 07:14.501
Hyah!

07:14.567 --> 07:17.938
Mmm. I know where she can put
that chopping to good use.

07:18.004 --> 07:19.439
Homer's neck?

07:19.506 --> 07:22.742
No. He doesn't have one.
Something better.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.280
Lower your right hand.
Gives you more power.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.749
Hmm.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.284
Thanks, um...

07:31.351 --> 07:32.953
Paula.
Friend of Patty's.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.654
We met at Burning Woman.

07:34.721 --> 07:35.922
Nice job on that wood.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.624
HOMER (weakly):
I helped.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.693
Yeah, you helped, all right.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.828
You helped that hammock
kiss the ground.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.296
(weakly):
D'oh.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.998
Marge, I don't know
if you know this,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.567
but I'm a top‐level contender
at Timbersports.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.135
That's so interesting.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.705
How does it feel
to be magnificent?

07:51.771 --> 07:52.939
I'll show you.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.809

07:55.875 --> 07:57.911

08:03.016 --> 08:05.585
(sighs) Timbersports
is more than a hobby.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.355
It's an unpaid passion
that you do in your spare time.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.690
Now, we're going to the woods.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.561
(breathes deeply)
Ah.

08:14.627 --> 08:16.129
‐What are you doing?
‐Breathing.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.698
Breathing for the first time
in my life.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.267
Ah.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.337
Can I do one thing

08:34.981 --> 08:38.385
think of things
that make you mad.

08:38.451 --> 08:41.021
Oh, nothing really makes me mad.

and welcome

09:59.933 --> 10:02.502
to the Springfield
Timbersports Pro‐Am.

10:02.569 --> 10:05.972
I'm here with former
NBA analyst Anger Watkins.

10:06.039 --> 10:09.476
Timbersports.
Timber <i>sports?</i>

10:09.542 --> 10:13.146
I snap one P. A.'s bra strap,
and this is where I land?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.982
Who is the Lebron of this thing?
No one will tell me.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.684
His name is Matt Cogar.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.486
Is his nickname The Cougar?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.454
No, his nickname is Matt.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.722
Matt isn't a nickname.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.324
It's a <i>name</i> name.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.559
(stammers)
I'd storm out of here right now

10:26.626 --> 10:28.761
if I weren't so terrified
of squirrels.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.530
Take my money!
Take it!

have to kill all those trees.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.071

of global warming.

from his mama.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.241
Oh! Marge Simpson
takes the lead!

11:15.308 --> 11:19.212
No one saw this coming,
because no one was watching.

11:19.279 --> 11:23.016

possibly be her motivation?

11:39.399 --> 11:40.967

Now's the time
I should tell you. Paula is gay.

Aw.
She made a friend.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.108
You've made me a new woman.

11:49.175 --> 11:51.110
Oh.
Should I be concerned?

It's no weirder than that time
our knees touched under the bar.

You were great,

to the next level?
