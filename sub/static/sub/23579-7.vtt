WEBVTT

00:29.696 --> 00:32.907
<i>The danger of living too many times:</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:34.325
<i>you forget to fear death.</i>

00:35.910 --> 00:39.372
<i>We dismiss the Grim Reaper</i>
<i>as a quaint metaphor.</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:45.170
<i>But fearing death...</i>

00:45.253 --> 00:46.337
<i>it's good for you.</i>

00:53.678 --> 00:56.056
<i>Just stop complaining.</i>

00:57.307 --> 00:59.684
Take off that necklace.
I told you to throw it away.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.103
No. It's Mom's.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.355
You're just like her.

01:06.691 --> 01:12.447
Disobedient, ungrateful... bitch.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.710
Tak?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.759
<i>I'll tell them it wasn't your fault.</i>

01:37.222 --> 01:39.557
<i>I'll say the truth. They have to listen.</i>

01:44.354 --> 01:46.189
<i> Do you trust me, Rei?</i>

01:49.609 --> 01:51.694
Every way there is.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.891
Why did you kill your father?

02:22.350 --> 02:24.936
You're just a kid
and you blew his stack out.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.980
He deserved it.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.357
Because he beat up your sister?

02:29.440 --> 02:33.027
He wasn't going to stop.
He killed my mother.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.780
Cops say your mom ran away.
-Cops are stupid.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.741
I told them what happened.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.704
He dumped her in a coolant pool.
There was no body.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.124
Nothing left.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.421
So they didn't believe me.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.755
I believe you.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.430
The Settled Worlds
are full of lawlessness.

03:01.180 --> 03:04.434
Killers, rapists, slavers, gangs.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.937
They leave behind victims. Innocents.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.066
We travel between planets,
protect our citizens.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.319
I've got nothing left for you to take.

03:14.402 --> 03:18.364
They took my body, probably sold it off.
What do you want?

03:18.448 --> 03:21.618
To recruit you.
Colonial Tactical Assault Corps.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.162
You're CTAC?

03:24.245 --> 03:26.164
Looking at you, I see potential.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.249
I can make something out of you, son.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.378
What about my sister?

03:36.758 --> 03:40.470
I did what I did because of Rei.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.306
I want her safe.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.268
You've never been able to trust anyone,
have you?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.440
Son, we are the Protectorate.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.234
We protect.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.570
I'll see to it
she's placed in a good family,

03:58.029 --> 04:01.658
that she gets a good life with people
who will love her and treat her well.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.748
You have my word.

04:20.843 --> 04:24.055
What happens next?
Will I get my body back?

04:24.138 --> 04:27.392
I'll requisition it for the Corps.
You can use it if you ever come back.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.478
-You're casting off this planet with me.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.981
Train on different worlds,
in different sleeves.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.817
This time tomorrow,
you'll be in a man's body.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.444
And no one will ever hurt you
or yours again.

04:38.528 --> 04:42.323
Off What about Rei?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.075
You disconnect from this life.

04:47.078 --> 04:50.331
Anyone who knows what you are
will be in danger.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.667
I have to tell her.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.168
If you want her to be safe,

04:54.627 --> 04:56.504
you're never going to be able
to see her again.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.177
Trust me.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.296
<i>Tak?</i>

05:38.921 --> 05:39.881
Rei?

05:41.799 --> 05:43.134
Welcome back.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.677
You're gonna die.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.763
You're bleeding internally,
holed all over,

05:46.846 --> 05:49.974
and you picked up a blood infection
in that slaughterhouse.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.934
I tried, but I can't save this sleeve.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.978
I know I shouldn't have bothered,

05:54.062 --> 05:55.897
but I wanted to hurry up
the family reunion.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.234
It looks like it's gonna have to wait
until we can get you resleeved.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.362
Wait... Ortega?

06:03.446 --> 06:07.658
She's fine. I knocked her out.
I'm sorry. I was in a rush.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.077
Relax.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.829
You're gonna wake up in a new body,
something more durable

06:11.913 --> 06:13.831
and a little less <i>gaijin</i>
and with better hair.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.501
You have to save this sleeve.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.587
Don't be such a baby.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.506
You used to switch sleeves
like changing socks.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.590
No!

06:22.965 --> 06:25.176
-Tak, you're beat to shit, septic...
-No.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.762
...and the Reaper in your system
is fighting the blood scrubbers.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.347
Probably tripping balls right now.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.683
If I don't kill you,
the fever and organ failure likely will.

06:32.767 --> 06:33.851
Promise.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.020
Jesus, why?

06:38.523 --> 06:39.857
Fine, Tak.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.527
If that's what you want.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.530
-I owe you that much.

07:15.643 --> 07:16.978
Here...

07:17.687 --> 07:20.231
You're not here. You died.

07:20.314 --> 07:21.149
Didn't take.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.401
You know me better than that, big brother.

07:23.484 --> 07:28.156
-We always come back for each other.
-No matter how long it takes.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.283
250 years.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.119
You've really let yourself go.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.086
How?

07:46.883 --> 07:49.427
Quick version, then you shut up and rest.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.559
They blew our shuttle.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.313
Next thing I knew,
I woke up in some low-rent virtual

08:00.396 --> 08:04.734
with some pencil-neck archaeology student
working on his dissertation.

08:05.151 --> 08:09.447
He stumbled on my stack in the wreckage,
along with some genetic material.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.325
Total freak chance, one in a billion.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.538
He resleeved me in a synth and...

08:17.622 --> 08:19.999
Well, you were on ice
and everyone else was dead.

08:20.458 --> 08:25.171
I told him I was an innocent bystander
killed by heartless Envoys.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.632
First chance I got, I booked with my DNA.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.176
Made a lot of money, grew a few clones.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.013
I've been on my own ever since.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.521
Not anymore.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.469
This sleeve is shit.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.972
Sleeve's not the problem.
Gotta pay the transfer fee.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.766
Hate the fucking reacclimation cocktail.
Headaches for days.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.101
Listen up!

09:20.184 --> 09:23.729
This team has been thrown together
from who's available on cast.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.525
ReAc for a half day,
then we stand up at 0300.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.736
Kovacs, how does it feel
to be back in your original skin?

09:31.362 --> 09:33.322
A lot more mileage than I expected.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.908
Reflex still good.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.910
Thank the Corps
for keeping it in shape.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.745
Who the fuck is this guy,
he gets a retread?

09:39.829 --> 09:41.539
It's my home world.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.499
First time I've been back
since I joined up.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.876
Target is a yakuza<i> kumicho...</i>

09:45.960 --> 09:48.671
...by the name of Gottfrid Saito.

09:48.754 --> 09:53.634
Domestic terror, murder, prostitution.
And he doesn't pay his taxes.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.552
Whoops.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.013
They need to be taught
a very public lesson.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.516
The must-kill is Saito. Slag his stack.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.144
Everyone else is kill as kill can.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.228
Most kills...

10:04.312 --> 10:07.315
...most days off, most bonus money.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.400
Even you guys could figure out
how that works.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.547
Put up your hands!
Put up your hands!

10:35.676 --> 10:37.345
Kovacs, you're on Saito.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.132
Put the gun down

11:15.216 --> 11:18.928
before I drill a hole right through
your stack, <i>gaijin</i> motherfucker.

11:20.596 --> 11:21.972
You're gonna call your friends,

11:22.056 --> 11:25.768
tell them you've taken down Saito,
to come in here weapons down.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.563
Where did you get that necklace?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.234
That was my mother's.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.580
Tak?

11:48.332 --> 11:50.292
Kill him, you worthless whore!

11:51.335 --> 11:52.545
Kill him now!

11:53.671 --> 11:55.214
Where the fuck have you been?

11:56.715 --> 11:58.551
No!
Kovacs, take him out!

12:03.180 --> 12:04.682
Kovacs, what are you doing?

13:25.513 --> 13:26.639
Let's go.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.952
This way.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.539
Tak, come on.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.375
<i>A good family?</i>

13:54.458 --> 13:57.837
-That's what he promised me.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.714
Well, technically, it's true.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.092
I was sold to the yakuza as <i>kobun.</i>

14:03.175 --> 14:07.429
A perfect little foot soldier,
loyal to my <i>oyabun,</i> Saito.

14:07.513 --> 14:11.642
And why wouldn't I be?
I didn't have anyone else.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.397
He said you'd be safe.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.023
And you believed him?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.402
I remember you being smarter.

14:25.823 --> 14:30.035
Protectorate, Jaeger,
he will come after us.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.997
He's not gonna stop until he finds me.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.208
The yakuza and the Protectorate
both want our heads.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.210
I don't know which is worse.

14:38.752 --> 14:42.464
Any ideas that don't involve
dying a slow and terrible death?

14:46.969 --> 14:49.597
I don't know. We gotta get off-planet.
I'm not sure how.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.766
Jaeger's gonna block the ports
and the casting stations.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.685
Slow and terrible death it is.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.522
I'll take a few more with me.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.066
In the forest...

15:02.234 --> 15:05.029
did you ever tell anyone
what we found when we were kids?

15:05.112 --> 15:06.238
Not a soul.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.532
You trust me?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.911
Not even a little.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.622
Why?

15:30.763 --> 15:33.182
I used to think
the Patchwork Man lived here.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.143
Guess we'll find out.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.762
Are you sure you remember
where it is?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.555
Maybe.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.309
"Maybe"

16:20.104 --> 16:21.063
Definitely.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.662
This was a lot easier when I was eight.

16:36.745 --> 16:39.456
We follow this east,
it'll take us to the caves.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.042
Not till tomorrow. It's getting dark.

16:50.467 --> 16:54.430
Look at the way the Songspire
threads through the boulders.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.602
You ever wonder if the Elder civilization
designed it to do that?

17:01.020 --> 17:05.733
Create structures underground with
the branches as some kind of scaffold?

17:11.572 --> 17:14.992
Those are the most words
you've said to me in hours

17:15.075 --> 17:17.453
and they're about fucking rocks.

17:24.418 --> 17:29.173
It's fine. It's in the past.
Let's keep moving.

17:29.256 --> 17:32.509
No. We can camp here for the night.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.387
We're deep enough in the forest.

17:35.929 --> 17:42.311
So, tomorrow we go underground and what?
Hide like animals?

17:43.228 --> 17:44.772
You got a better plan?

17:44.855 --> 17:47.191
I'd say we should find
some potential allies,

17:47.274 --> 17:50.027
but we just killed everyone we know, so...

18:04.458 --> 18:07.336
I missed you so much.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.801
I'm sorry, Rei.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.561
Why did you...

18:30.526 --> 18:33.112
<i>Death isn't only</i>
<i>about the destruction of the body.</i>

18:33.779 --> 18:37.908
<i>Sometimes, just like that,</i>
<i>you extinguish one self</i>

18:38.283 --> 18:39.618
<i>and another is born.</i>

18:40.577 --> 18:42.704
<i>But every birth is violent</i>

18:43.288 --> 18:45.040
<i>and there's no death without pain.</i>

18:59.805 --> 19:01.390
Looking for these?

19:03.183 --> 19:06.103
Fuck them up, Tak.
I don't care if I live or die!

19:06.186 --> 19:07.479
But he does.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.152
He doesn't wanna lose you.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.858
I vote we kill him.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.568
It's not a democracy, de Soto.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.653
Then I respectfully request we kill him.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.447
Request duly noted, Envoy.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.325
Dismissed.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.039
Where's my sister?

20:07.122 --> 20:09.333
They're getting her something to eat.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.376
She's fine.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.672
I know who you are.

20:16.506 --> 20:17.966
I'd be disappointed if you didn't.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.511
Your faces are all over
the wanted beacons.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.388
The bounty's a fortune.

20:24.139 --> 20:27.267
-You've pissed someone off.
-I have a gift.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.728
-I believe that.
We'll be all right.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.688
I believe that, too.

20:32.356 --> 20:36.151
You're CTAC SpecOps.
Protectorate through and through.

20:41.490 --> 20:45.786
Rumor is you took out
an entire squad of Praetorians.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.537
CTAC's trying to keep it quiet.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.415
Looks bad, one of their own
biting the hand that feeds.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.751
I think I chewed off the whole arm.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.795
They pissed me off.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.424
Your sister mowed through some of the best
the yakuza had to offer.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.968
They pissed her off.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.846
The two of you know the secret workings
of both crime and government,

21:04.930 --> 21:06.390
which are more or less the same.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.600
-Not interested.
-I haven't offered you anything yet.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.394
Don't bother. Just let us go.

21:10.477 --> 21:13.230
On some level,
you know we're on the same side.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.649
The enemy of my enemy--

21:15.732 --> 21:18.819
Is just one more person
who might knife me in my sleep.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.909
You're a little cynical, Takeshi Kovacs.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.662
I'm tied up. I'd say I have reason to be.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.334
Join us. Make a difference.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.422
Nothing makes a difference.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.758
I'm done fighting in this war.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.219
War is like
any other bad relationship.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.305
You want out, but at what price?

21:46.388 --> 21:49.433
If they knew an Uprising base
was on Harlan's World,

21:49.516 --> 21:51.310
they'd tear apart this planet to find you.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.353
Aren't you worried I'll tell 'em?

22:02.571 --> 22:03.822
No.

22:05.490 --> 22:09.411
If I killed you...
the Protectorate would forgive everything.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.081
Do you want their forgiveness?

22:14.416 --> 22:20.297
The innocent, the person you were
before all this, he's still there.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.095
I see the boy inside the man.

22:34.936 --> 22:39.941
Tell me something, Takeshi Kovacs:
What did the Protectorate take from you?

22:42.194 --> 22:43.695
Everything.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.782
What would you do for revenge?

22:49.701 --> 22:51.036
Anything.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.332
That's a good start. You don't want me.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.840
Don't you understand what CTAC does
to make someone like me?

23:04.841 --> 23:08.095
They burn out
every evolved violence-limitation instinct

23:08.178 --> 23:09.638
in the human psyche.

23:11.306 --> 23:14.309
And they replace it
with the conscious will to do harm.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.812
And yet you haven't hurt me.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.021
I might still.

23:23.944 --> 23:27.447
No. You won't, Kovacs.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.952
You're only pretending
to be one of the monsters.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.885
Fuckers took my sword.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.930
What'd you say to her?
I told her I'd stay if you stayed.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.518
Shit, Tak! You said yes.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.646
-Well, you wanted a better plan.
-I still do.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.899
Maybe we help overthrow the Protectorate.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.819
Maybe these people slit our throats.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.780
Either way, from now on,
we stick together.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.908
Family, no matter what.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.910
Family...

24:15.620 --> 24:16.913
no matter what.

24:57.871 --> 25:01.666
See de Soto to get your weapons back.
You start training tomorrow.

25:13.970 --> 25:15.847
<i>We lived alongside them...</i>

25:17.557 --> 25:19.392
<i>or somewhere near them, anyway.</i>

25:20.727 --> 25:22.020
<i>We trained with them.</i>

25:22.103 --> 25:25.690
CTAC troops shoot themselves up
with reacclimation drugs

25:25.774 --> 25:28.109
to try to make the sleeve obey them.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.362
But none of their techniques
touch the pure mind

25:30.445 --> 25:31.821
and that is what you must control.

25:32.781 --> 25:37.619
Master yourself and you can ride any skin,
anywhere in the galaxy,

25:38.328 --> 25:39.454
at a moment's notice.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.376
You must learn the weakness of weapons.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.338
Easy to say
with a Sunjet in your hand.

25:49.464 --> 25:50.465
I'm unarmed.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.092
Take me out.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.179
Go for the stack.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.017
What's wrong, Kovacs?

26:02.769 --> 26:04.229
Think it's unfair?

26:09.025 --> 26:10.235
Let's even the odds.

26:18.868 --> 26:21.371
Both of you, bring me down.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.711
I'd rather take him out.
Is that an option?

26:27.794 --> 26:30.839
-Anytime, anyplace, de Soto.
-Now will do.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.757
-Take your shot.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.406
This sleeve is a tool.

26:57.115 --> 27:00.744
It does not control me. I control it.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.747
This is the weakness of weapons.

27:04.497 --> 27:08.543
They are tools to kill and destroy.
They are not what gives you power.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.505
You are the weapon.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.426
You are the killer and destroyer.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.765
You had the right idea,

27:22.140 --> 27:24.476
but next time,
if you wanna save someone you love,

27:25.935 --> 27:26.936
move faster.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.814
I'll remember that.

27:36.738 --> 27:41.534
You have two weapons,
yourselves and each other.

27:41.618 --> 27:44.371
-You totally ignored the second.
-'Cause he's a CTAC dickhead.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.164
In actual combat,
you'd both be dead.

27:46.581 --> 27:49.209
The true strength of the wolf
isn't fangs, speed, and skill.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.168
It's the pack.

27:50.877 --> 27:54.214
Whatever world you needlecast into,
build a pack.

27:54.297 --> 27:57.717
Find ways to inspire loyalty
in a few capable locals,

27:57.801 --> 28:00.261
even if many of them
will ultimately be expendable.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.930
We are Envoys.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.642
And we take what is offered.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.644
<i>When Quell felt we were ready,</i>

28:07.727 --> 28:09.229
<i>we started running missions with them.</i>

28:09.312 --> 28:12.357
These are the access protocols
on the CTAC barracks on Taurus 4.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.651
The secure military R and D facility?

28:14.734 --> 28:16.986
They leave the backdoor open
on a squad of combat sleeves,

28:17.070 --> 28:19.739
just in case the locals
ever breach security and get inside.

28:19.823 --> 28:20.824
It's a fail-safe.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.326
So we're casting into Protectorate meat
primed on the slab?

28:23.410 --> 28:24.869
Or we're walking into a trap.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.205
You trying to say something
about my brother, de Soto?

28:27.288 --> 28:30.708
You can't fucking trust him.
How can you fucking trust him?

28:30.792 --> 28:33.711
Because he gave us the intel
that's getting us in.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.674
<i>We're going for the site database,</i>

28:38.091 --> 28:41.636
<i>where we'll download the security specs</i>
<i>on the facilities listed here.</i>

28:42.011 --> 28:45.181
<i>Then we blow the database,</i>
<i>make it look like simple sabotage.</i>

28:45.849 --> 28:47.767
<i>They won't even know we took anything.</i>

28:51.521 --> 28:52.480
Punch it.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.196
<i>Target needlecast initiated.</i>

29:00.280 --> 29:02.991
<i>DHF phase coherence established. </i>

29:03.658 --> 29:06.786
<i>Transfer is a go. Commence engagement.</i>

29:07.954 --> 29:09.581
<i>Engagement in progress.</i>

29:10.915 --> 29:15.336
<i>Engagement in progress. </i>
<i>Engagement in progress.</i>

29:20.717 --> 29:22.510
<i>DHF incoming.</i>

29:22.886 --> 29:24.053
<i>Return needlecast confirmed.</i>

29:27.891 --> 29:29.142
Pushed me out the transfer station.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.895
-Fucking stayed behind, that asshole.

29:31.978 --> 29:34.564
You gotta get him out.
There's gotta be a way.

29:34.647 --> 29:37.108
You did this. You left him back there.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.610
Calm the fuck down.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.403
I tried to get him out. He didn't listen.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.614
If you're lying to me, you're a dead man!

29:42.697 --> 29:45.909
Really? If I wanted him dead,
I'd kill him to his face.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.994
You've wanted him dead since the day

29:48.077 --> 29:50.038
-he walked into this place.
-Come on.

29:53.333 --> 29:59.798
<i>DHF phased successfully.</i>
<i>Transfer complete. No casualties.</i>

30:02.091 --> 30:03.134
What?

30:09.599 --> 30:10.642
You asshole.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.773
You all right?

30:27.033 --> 30:30.245
<i>I can't remember</i>
<i>all the things Quell taught me.</i>

30:30.495 --> 30:34.582
<i>It was like oxygen soaking into me.</i>

30:36.417 --> 30:37.252
Fuck you, man.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.171
I was making the exit.

30:41.297 --> 30:42.882
I didn't need your help.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.093
I'm never gonna need your help.

30:45.468 --> 30:49.430
So don't get a big fucking head,
you arrogant son of a bitch.

30:51.724 --> 30:52.725
Are we clear?

31:13.580 --> 31:14.831
Good talk.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.265
<i>She gave me the life I never had.</i>

31:36.436 --> 31:38.229
Can you pass me that?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.065
<i>I've lied to you.</i>

31:41.441 --> 31:43.860
We cannot win a conventional war
against this enemy,

31:43.943 --> 31:46.779
because it's not the Protectorate
we're fighting.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.199
It's immortality itself.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.246
The creation of stacks was a miracle

31:55.330 --> 31:58.416
and the beginning of the destruction
of our species.

31:58.499 --> 32:03.463
A hundred years from now, a thousand,
I can see what we will become.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.050
And it's not human.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.386
A new class of people
so wealthy and powerful,

32:10.470 --> 32:13.348
they answer to no one and cannot die.

32:13.431 --> 32:18.811
Death was the ultimate safeguard
against the darkest angels of our nature.

32:19.562 --> 32:23.441
Now the monsters among us
will own everything,

32:23.524 --> 32:27.153
-consume everything, control everything.

32:27.236 --> 32:29.530
They will make themselves gods
and us slaves...

32:29.614 --> 32:31.616
...in all but name.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.743
Pretty much never.
I hate that intuition shit.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.370
Civilization is at a tipping point.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.580
-We are riding the fulcrum...
...between hope and oblivion.

32:39.874 --> 32:40.959
Doubt.

32:41.042 --> 32:45.838
If we do not stop the curse
of eternal life in our realm...

32:47.507 --> 32:49.509
our children will inherit despair.

32:49.592 --> 32:53.221
The ebb and flow of life is what makes us
all equal in the end.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.600
The Uprising must end immortality.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.853
You're talking about bringing back
real death.

33:04.941 --> 33:05.858
What about you?

33:05.942 --> 33:09.112
I'm prepared to die to reset the balance.
That's my decision.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.699
You have to decide for yourselves.

33:14.409 --> 33:20.415
I've created a program called Acheron
that downloads into DHF and rewrites it,

33:20.498 --> 33:23.626
giving every mind exactly 100 years.

33:23.710 --> 33:27.714
No matter how rich and powerful you are,
death will no longer be optional.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.092
But how is that even possible?

33:31.759 --> 33:34.012
You'd have to download the program

33:34.095 --> 33:36.597
into every stack on all the Settled Worlds
at the same time.

33:36.681 --> 33:40.727
I'll run a DA Mission into
the on-planet Protectorate garrison here,

33:41.561 --> 33:44.897
steal the casting source codes
for the Central Core.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.108
Once we bring back the codes...

33:47.191 --> 33:49.736
You'll use the codes
to cast into the Central Core.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.116
Full mobilization.

33:55.199 --> 34:00.329
The Uprising will fight our way in
and spike the Core with Acheron.

34:01.205 --> 34:05.293
It will spread into every DHF
in every system.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.379
Nobody's ever come back
from the Central Core.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.925
I'm not planning on coming back.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.179
You're asking us to die.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.848
I'm asking you to embrace being human.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.773
We aren't meant to live forever.
It corrupts even the best of us.

34:27.565 --> 34:31.986
Leave, if you choose. I will not stop you.
But those of us who stay...

34:35.948 --> 34:38.326
together we will save humanity.

34:38.743 --> 34:39.869
Are you with me?

35:06.312 --> 35:08.940
I need a team of five
to attack the garrison.

35:33.548 --> 35:37.802
What are you doing?
-I'm trying to make a difference.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.555
Quell! Move, move, move!

37:05.473 --> 37:06.474
Move, move, move!

37:10.019 --> 37:12.146
-Fuck! Fuck!
Drop your weapon.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.356
I want him alive.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.215
<i> I'm a nostalgic guy.</i>

37:40.758 --> 37:43.678
Twenty-eight years
and you haven't even repainted.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.973
You know, you should really, uh,
just spruce up the place.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.476
My people have your DHF
and birth sleeve.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.562
I'm inbound on a suborb from Newpest.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.773
Let's chat.

37:55.856 --> 37:58.693
They tell me there was a woman with you,
by the way.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.115
Was it your sister?

38:10.538 --> 38:13.541
It was your mother. She said to say hi.

38:16.627 --> 38:20.381
Whoever she was, she left you behind.
So did all your friends.

38:23.342 --> 38:25.011
They were late for dinner.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.309
What do you want?

38:31.392 --> 38:34.061
Just a little catch-up time
with an old friend.

38:39.650 --> 38:40.901
But you're right...

38:41.819 --> 38:46.866
what's the point of virtual
if you can't redecorate?

38:46.949 --> 38:50.494
Try a new look.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.210
Let's see what your face
looks like with your nose cut off.

38:59.378 --> 39:00.796
Don't you touch him.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.723
They've got you drugged, Kovacs.
Do you understand?

39:11.390 --> 39:13.684
We don't know what they gave you.
We can't pull you out.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.020
You have to wake yourself up.

39:16.103 --> 39:18.939
Security, we have a breach
in Interrogation.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.908
Your security is for shit.

39:28.991 --> 39:31.285
I don't understand.
You can't hurt me in here.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.662
Kovacs, pull yourself
out of the construct.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.792
Tak, come with me. Please.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.503
Wake up!

40:10.199 --> 40:11.867
We're on the move.
Here we go.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.412
Think you can keep up this time

40:22.920 --> 40:25.548
Can't believe you still wanna
go along with this mission

40:25.631 --> 40:27.716
after Jaeger almost got you.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.260
We should leave.

40:29.343 --> 40:30.678
They came back for me.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.806
They came back
because she ordered them to.

40:33.889 --> 40:37.059
So Jaeger wouldn't interrogate you,
find out what she's planning.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.854
Not a single thing she does
that isn't calculated.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.689
It's all move, countermove.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.607
You're exaggerating.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.609
And you're naive.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.071
We've both seen enough death.

40:51.907 --> 40:54.243
-We can't just abandon them.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.746
What if they find a workaround
for her program?

40:58.289 --> 41:00.958
We've lost so much time.

41:01.542 --> 41:05.546
These last few years,
we finally got each other back.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.884
I don't wanna die.

41:11.510 --> 41:13.554
I wanna live.

41:14.138 --> 41:17.349
I want us to see a million tomorrows.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.102
I'm not leaving.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.938
No matter how many tomorrows
we're talking about.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.572
What are we, Rei?

41:40.080 --> 41:40.998
We're family.

41:41.081 --> 41:44.460
We're Envoys and we have a job to do.

41:47.254 --> 41:52.635
I just...
I don't want tomorrow to be our last day.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.599
It won't be, all right?

42:00.476 --> 42:02.186
We won't let it be.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.051
You saved me.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.345
No one ever has before.

42:39.598 --> 42:41.308
That our secret battle plan?

42:42.309 --> 42:44.770
It's filled with things
I should have learned by now.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.983
Including the names and stories
of the fallen in this war.

42:53.612 --> 42:55.406
Tomorrow, we attack the Central Core.

42:55.489 --> 42:58.492
Someone else will be writing down
the names of the dead.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.206
Jaeger was hunting me.

43:05.207 --> 43:07.626
Now he knows
you're on Harlan's World.

43:09.795 --> 43:10.879
I'm sorry.

43:11.755 --> 43:14.717
Do you feel guilty?
About the Protectorate?

43:15.384 --> 43:18.679
-It was because of me that--
-No, it's because of me. All of it.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.349
Everyone in that book was someone
the Protectorate killed, not you.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.185
It's because of me,
because I created stacks.

43:27.354 --> 43:31.442
No, the woman who created stacks
was Nadia Makita.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.360
Nadia went on the run.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.239
And she changed her name
so that no one would ever know.

43:37.823 --> 43:40.868
You're... You're Nadia...

43:46.081 --> 43:48.000
I wanted to be an explorer.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.253
See other worlds with my own eyes, but...

43:53.380 --> 43:56.759
one life wasn't enough time
to see the stars, so...

43:58.135 --> 44:01.889
I found a way to transfer
the human consciousness

44:01.972 --> 44:05.601
between bodies and,
in that creation, soar.

44:07.353 --> 44:12.650
Suddenly, anyone could travel distances
beyond imagination faster than light,

44:12.733 --> 44:16.487
and no one would ever be limited
by one lifetime again.

44:17.571 --> 44:20.783
That's... That's beautiful.

44:20.866 --> 44:24.119
Rome was a town of refugee cattle herders,

44:24.203 --> 44:27.998
but it became the most powerful empire
of ancient Earth.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.833
Do you know how?

44:29.917 --> 44:31.126
Roads.

44:31.210 --> 44:36.757
Roads were the technology that let them
send their armies all over the world.

44:37.716 --> 44:42.930
I thought I was freeing the human spirit,
but I was building the roads for Rome.

44:43.514 --> 44:46.600
Eternal life for those who can afford it

44:46.684 --> 44:49.436
means eternal control
over those who can't.

44:50.979 --> 44:53.107
That is the gift I gave humanity.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.318
And that is the reason
we are all going to die.

44:56.402 --> 45:00.781
So stop looking at me like I'm a hero,
because I am not.

45:03.617 --> 45:05.452
I can't stop looking at you.

45:11.583 --> 45:12.710
I won't.

45:18.632 --> 45:20.134
We can't.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.928
Forget heroes and monsters.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.432
You're the woman who set me free.

47:26.343 --> 47:27.594
I'll talk to her.

47:27.678 --> 47:30.430
We're casting to the Core
in less than five hours, Tak.

47:31.390 --> 47:32.724
I'll see you at camp.

47:32.808 --> 47:33.892
All right.

47:36.895 --> 47:38.355
It wasn't a mistake.

47:39.815 --> 47:40.857
I know.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.239
I know.

48:06.091 --> 48:08.760
Rei! Rei!

48:09.761 --> 48:11.305
Let's talk about this!

48:13.682 --> 48:14.516
Rei!

48:24.985 --> 48:25.819
What?

48:29.990 --> 48:31.116
Rei!

48:35.495 --> 48:36.371
Where are you?

48:37.164 --> 48:38.582
<i>Where are you?</i>

48:55.015 --> 48:56.058
Feeling better?

48:58.518 --> 48:59.853
I saved the sleeve.

49:00.604 --> 49:04.024
You're gonna have to jolt
if you wanna get back to fighting speed.

49:04.107 --> 49:06.193
Goliath. It's a CTAC stim.

49:06.276 --> 49:08.445
Works great,
if it doesn't make you stroke out.

49:08.528 --> 49:11.907
-I'm... I'm good, thanks.
-Your call.

49:13.450 --> 49:15.452
You should eat something at least.

49:17.037 --> 49:20.957
Been on my own here, staying out of sight,
but it's a little bit of everything.

49:22.626 --> 49:24.962
I couldn't believe it
when I heard the rumors.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.464
Fucking Envoy in Bay City?

49:27.547 --> 49:28.674
Sounded impossible.

49:29.132 --> 49:30.509
I had to check.

49:38.558 --> 49:41.937
What have you been doing all this time?

49:42.020 --> 49:44.189
I went back to Harlan's World.

49:44.272 --> 49:45.565
You should see it.

49:46.525 --> 49:49.111
I don't know what I thought I'd find.

49:50.821 --> 49:53.323
But nothing I remembered survived.

49:54.616 --> 49:55.659
It's all gone.

49:57.577 --> 49:59.996
That's the hardest thing to get used to.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.290
Nothing survives.

50:08.088 --> 50:09.381
Nothing but us.

50:34.656 --> 50:36.575
Quell

50:37.367 --> 50:39.036
Reileen, do you copy?

51:48.688 --> 51:53.193
Monsters. Monsters.

51:53.276 --> 51:56.738
Monsters... everywhere.

51:59.032 --> 52:00.909
Vidaura. Vidaura.

52:01.743 --> 52:02.994
Who did this

52:03.078 --> 52:05.455
-Monsters. Came from above.

52:05.539 --> 52:07.499
-Everywhere. Everywhere.

52:10.001 --> 52:12.295
-Monsters!
-Vidaura! Vidaura!

52:12.379 --> 52:14.464
-Stop!

52:14.548 --> 52:16.383
Get back to the real.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.719
Gimme the gun.
Okay, look at me. Gimme the gun.

52:19.803 --> 52:23.598
-I have to kill the monster.
-No. No, no, no! No!

52:31.064 --> 52:32.524
It was us.

52:33.149 --> 52:34.693
The enemy was us.

52:52.627 --> 52:55.255
<i> Tak! Where are you?</i>

52:55.338 --> 52:57.048
<i>Yes.</i>

52:57.132 --> 52:58.758
<i>What the fuck is happening?</i>

52:58.842 --> 53:02.721
Get to the shuttle bay. You hear me?
Get to the shuttle bay!

53:03.054 --> 53:06.975
Quellcrist Falconer!
Long live the Uprising!

53:07.058 --> 53:08.935
De Soto! Listen, look at me!
Look at me!

53:09.019 --> 53:11.479
-It's me, it's me.

53:11.563 --> 53:15.692
I did this to myself.
I can't remember why.

53:15.775 --> 53:17.736
Gonna get you out of here.
I'm gonna get you out--

53:34.085 --> 53:35.503
<i> Tak</i>
Reileen?

53:35.587 --> 53:37.380
Just go, I'll meet you there.

53:38.340 --> 53:40.842
Quell says gotta get to the next screen!

53:40.926 --> 53:42.344
Help me get to the next screen!

53:42.427 --> 53:45.221
-It's in my brain, it's in my brain!
-De Soto.

53:46.139 --> 53:48.016
-I've tried, Tak.
-I know.

53:48.099 --> 53:49.768
It's not a construct.

53:52.938 --> 53:54.105
I've tried.

53:56.024 --> 53:57.901
It won't let me.

53:57.984 --> 53:59.945
Tak, help me.

54:04.824 --> 54:07.410
-Okay. All right, buddy.

54:14.167 --> 54:15.627
Good talk.

54:17.337 --> 54:18.546
Good talk.

54:46.908 --> 54:48.994
Quell! Falcon One, do you copy?

54:49.703 --> 54:50.954
<i>Go for Falcon One! </i>

54:51.037 --> 54:53.456
<i></i>
-Stronghold is down!

54:59.212 --> 55:02.132
Stronghold is down.
I repeat, Stronghold has fallen.

55:02.215 --> 55:05.760
<i>-Echo Bridge, north side.</i>

55:08.680 --> 55:11.182
What the hell happened?
<i> CTAC in the caves. </i>

55:11.266 --> 55:13.226
Viral strike, direct stack download.

55:13.309 --> 55:15.562
<i>-All of them.</i>

55:16.646 --> 55:19.107
They went crazy. They killed each other.

55:20.525 --> 55:23.945
It's Rawling virus.
We must've been out of range...

55:24.696 --> 55:26.531
-the three of us.
Where is he?

55:26.614 --> 55:28.491
<i></i>
-Rei! Rei!

55:28.575 --> 55:30.869
<i>I'm not coming. </i>
<i>Get to the shuttle together.</i>

55:30.952 --> 55:31.995
-Forget it.
-Not gonna happen!

55:32.078 --> 55:34.622
I'm gonna<i> </i>lead them off.
If you don't get airborne now,

55:34.706 --> 55:37.125
they're gonna shoot you out of the sky
before you get clear.

55:37.208 --> 55:38.501
Don't ask me to do this.

55:38.585 --> 55:39.836
Get your ass up here now!

55:39.919 --> 55:42.464
Get to the Core and deploy Acheron!

55:42.547 --> 55:44.758
You still can do it.
You can change everything.

55:44.841 --> 55:46.301
But not if you die on this rock!

55:50.305 --> 55:51.723
Go!

55:56.728 --> 55:57.771
Run now! Survive.

56:01.649 --> 56:02.609
<i>That's an order. </i>

56:03.526 --> 56:05.070
Do you understand?

56:07.238 --> 56:08.239
I do.

56:09.574 --> 56:10.408
Go!

56:48.947 --> 56:50.573
You didn't get her, Jaeger.

56:51.241 --> 56:52.450
You'll never get her.

56:53.410 --> 56:54.911
<i>Tak--</i>

57:49.591 --> 57:52.260
I won't pick anything up
with all this ash.

57:52.343 --> 57:55.013
Find him. God damn it, fucking find him.

57:57.682 --> 57:59.100
Kovacs!

58:00.935 --> 58:02.896
I'm coming for you, you hear me?

58:04.063 --> 58:06.232
Doesn't matter how far you run!

58:44.312 --> 58:48.483
Apparently, he was a real
pain in the ass. Nobody liked him.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.903
I heard you decapitated him.

58:51.986 --> 58:55.198
I mean, a head's portable, I guess--

58:55.281 --> 59:00.495
You were with Quell in the shuttle
when it got hit.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.457
How did she die?

59:10.797 --> 59:11.965
It was all so fast.

59:20.014 --> 59:23.601
Honestly, I can't remember.

59:42.161 --> 59:44.497
Gonna splash my face with some water.

59:45.456 --> 59:46.457
Sure.

59:59.262 --> 1:00:03.224
<i>Hallucination, displacement, retreat.</i>

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:13.860
<i>You have to fight the despair.</i>

1:00:56.319 --> 1:00:57.987
Laws don't apply to people like us.

1:01:08.873 --> 1:01:10.208
Takeshi, is that you?

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.312
<i>Mom said grudges are stupid. </i>

1:01:31.396 --> 1:01:34.524
She said you had to let them go
or else it would kill your soul.

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:36.609
<i>What do you think?</i>

1:02:13.104 --> 1:02:14.856
-That's not the evac route.

1:02:27.243 --> 1:02:28.411
Why?

1:02:29.787 --> 1:02:31.289
They gave me life.

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:35.293
Tak--

1:02:45.928 --> 1:02:49.015
There's only one reason
why you wouldn't remember what happened.

1:02:54.645 --> 1:02:56.856
You were backed up before the explosion.

1:02:57.982 --> 1:03:00.026
I never could lie to you.

1:03:19.253 --> 1:03:20.588
Why would you do that?

1:03:20.671 --> 1:03:22.256
That's what she asked me.

1:03:22.340 --> 1:03:24.425
I told her it was because
they gave me life.
