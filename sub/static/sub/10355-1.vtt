Hey, little dude.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.767
Hi.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.168
I'm MF Bob.

02:16.169 --> 02:19.305
I'd shake your hand,
let's hold the bacon.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.206
Bob?

02:20.207 --> 02:21.774
Yeah, mother fucking Bob.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.775
Oh.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.877
Oh.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.780
Oh, are you off
of betting me?

02:27.781 --> 02:29.115
No.
You want some bacon?

02:29.116 --> 02:31.851
Have you seen
a cell phone anywhere?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.119
Phil.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.286
Bro, what happened
last night?

02:34.287 --> 02:36.222
Dude,
I have no idea, man.

02:36.223 --> 02:37.890
I can't remember--
You have
an arrow right here.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.959
Yeah, no shit.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.827
I didn't notice.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.663
That looks really bad.

02:43.664 --> 02:47.033
Yeah, dude, I'm not as worried
about that as I am about these.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.802
These were in my ass
last night, dude.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.170
And I'm talking deep.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.205
I mean, upside down
Grand Canyon deep.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.207
Bro, what the fuck
are you wearing?

02:55.208 --> 02:57.777
I couldn't find my clothes
anywhere or my phone.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.145
I need that phone.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.980
I got clothes for you, man.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.181
You mean,
you don't remember

03:02.182 --> 03:04.050
how the fuck
you got that on?

03:04.051 --> 03:05.317
You got to get
that checked out.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.686
You're right.
You know what?

03:06.687 --> 03:08.187
I'm gonna do that
after I talk to my buddy Phil

03:08.188 --> 03:09.255
in another fucking room.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.856
Yes.
Let's go, man.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.992
But who is Phil?
I made bacon.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.827
You're MF Bob, aren't you?

03:14.828 --> 03:15.995
Yeah, it's me.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.329
Oh, fuck, bro.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.965
I had such a great time
last night.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.967
Party of the year,
straight up, man.

03:21.968 --> 03:24.570
And MF Bob, I'm a fat man.

03:24.571 --> 03:25.905
Who am I kidding?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.606
I fucking
love bacon, bro.

03:27.607 --> 03:28.407
Give me that.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.911
Oh, fuck.
Wait, man.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.513
What time is it?

03:34.514 --> 03:35.614
I don't know, dude.

03:35.615 --> 03:38.150
It's like fucking
3 o'clock or something.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.652
Oh, fuck that--
that was open.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.787
3 o'clock, dude,
Beth's gonna be here

03:41.788 --> 03:43.122
any fucking minute.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.390
Fuck Beth right
in her butt, bro.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.692
My virgin ass was
fucking tampered

03:46.693 --> 03:49.295
with last night, dude,
and I didn't hear the burglar

03:49.296 --> 03:50.796
alarm go off.

03:50.797 --> 03:51.997
I called Jamie and Beef,

03:51.998 --> 03:53.933
they're gonna be
here any minute

03:53.934 --> 03:56.068
and we're gonna find out
what the fuck
went down last night, dude.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.270
I already checked
all the websites for
party fucking evidence.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.205
Nothing,
just titties, still cool.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.643
Shit.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.513
Dude, I didn't tell you
everything.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.816
Okay, what?

04:11.918 --> 04:14.620
When I woke up
this morning...

04:16.555 --> 04:18.057
I was in bed
naked with Polly.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.063
Oh, damn!

04:24.064 --> 04:25.998
I told you
this would happen, dude.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.267
I told you.
I know pussy.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.335
I don't think
I slept with her, man.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.239
All I remember is I was
sitting in my dorm room

04:37.644 --> 04:40.880
and I just started
on my homework

04:40.881 --> 04:47.586
when I got a incoming call
on my computer for Beth.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.096
<i>Hey, baby.
 Hey, babe.</i>

04:57.097 --> 04:59.832
<i>I really, really miss you.</i>

04:59.833 --> 05:00.800
Oh, babe.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.004
<i>You know, these
 long-distance dealios
 just don't usually work out.</i>

05:08.175 --> 05:10.309
Oh.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.614
Oh, come on, Beth.

05:15.615 --> 05:19.151
<i>You are the one who decided
 to pack up and leave</i>

05:19.152 --> 05:20.920
<i>and go to college</i>

05:20.921 --> 05:23.289
<i>when you could have
 very well just stayed here</i>

05:23.290 --> 05:23.489
<i>and finished out
 community college with me.</i>

05:25.458 --> 05:26.826
I know, babe.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.563
But I've told you
I'm committed and-- and--

05:34.267 --> 05:36.635
<i>Are you playing
 with yourself?</i>

05:36.636 --> 05:39.872
No, Beth, no.
Absolutely not.

05:39.873 --> 05:43.008
<i>You promised me
 that you wouldn't play</i>

05:43.009 --> 05:44.176
<i>with yourself.</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:45.744
<i>What would Jesus do, Phil?</i>

05:45.745 --> 05:47.813
<i>I mean, honestly
 what would he do?</i>

05:48.915 --> 05:51.050
<i>Open the door!</i>

05:51.051 --> 05:52.818
One second.
<i>Dude, open the door.</i>

05:52.819 --> 05:54.053
Hold on.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.422
<i>I have to take a shit.</i>

05:56.423 --> 05:57.423
Hold on, okay, princess.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.627
<i>The cafeteria food
is destroying me, dude.</i>

06:01.628 --> 06:03.662
<i>It's Dia de Los
 Diarrhea out here.</i>

06:03.663 --> 06:06.498
Cal, go somewhere else,
dude.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.134
<i>You know I can only
do in home base.</i>

06:09.135 --> 06:10.936
<i>I don't play away games.</i>

06:10.937 --> 06:14.039
<i>I need to send a package for
 the Philippines right away.</i>

06:14.040 --> 06:16.642
Beth, just hold on,
all right?

06:16.643 --> 06:17.643
Just-- I'll be right back.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.846
Jesus!

06:26.319 --> 06:28.354
Oh! Oh!

06:28.355 --> 06:30.055
I'm sorry about that, babe.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.790
Beth, Beth, listen.
<i>Phil, come on.</i>

06:34.527 --> 06:35.127
There's something that I've been
wanting to ask you.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.632
<i>What?</i>

06:39.633 --> 06:39.999
I was gonna wait until
you came home from break.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.838
Oh, shit.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.507
For the warmth of
sweet baby mothers,

06:48.508 --> 06:50.142
will you please
close the door?

06:50.143 --> 06:53.012
This one is for you, Beth.

06:54.481 --> 06:57.316
<i>Come on, Phil,
 I really need to go.</i>

06:57.317 --> 06:59.184
Beth, Beth, just wait.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.820
Just one second,
okay, all right?

07:01.821 --> 07:03.222
Oh, it burns.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.356
Beth, my sweet babe,
I know it's not much,

07:09.996 --> 07:11.964
but I wanted to show you
that I am committed.
Oh, wait one more fart.

07:15.869 --> 07:16.135
<i>Oh, my God, Phil.
 Yes, yes, oh, my God!</i>

07:19.639 --> 07:21.840
<i>Sweet baby Jesus, yes!</i>

07:21.841 --> 07:22.875
Really, babe?

07:22.876 --> 07:24.043
Oh.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.778
<i>You know what?</i>

07:25.779 --> 07:27.846
<i>I'm gonna come up,
 tomorrow.</i>

07:27.847 --> 07:30.582
<i>I think that we should
 celebrate together,</i>

07:30.583 --> 07:33.018
<i>you know, the special way.</i>

07:33.019 --> 07:35.187
<i>Okay, I got to go, baby.</i>

07:35.188 --> 07:36.422
Sweet dreams.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.058
Oh, dude, call Guinness
Book and the Roto-Rooter, bro.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.967
Holy crap, I need
a cigarette after that.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.635
Oh, that burns.

07:49.636 --> 07:49.902
And you just interrupted
the best video chat with Beth.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.907
Oh, Beth sucks, bro.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.209
Dude, just layoff, man.
She's my girlfriend.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.344
I just proposed to her.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.347
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.183
Dude, we're going to the
biggest party tonight.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.684
Get Beth out of your mind.

08:05.685 --> 08:09.355
Where?
I got us access to the
biggest party of the year.

08:09.356 --> 08:13.292
I'm talking college kids,
I'm talking alumni
together for one night.

08:13.293 --> 08:16.895
I'm talking hookers,
guns, fire chops,
clowns, MILFs, GILFs.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.765
I'm talking about
a campus legend,

08:19.766 --> 08:21.667
mother fucking
Bob's party, bro.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.702
No way. Dude, how did you
get us into that?

08:23.703 --> 08:25.137
Because
I'm the fucking, man.

08:25.138 --> 08:28.407
Please, please, please take us
to the party, Jamie, please.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.908
I already told Phil
we're gonna go.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.410
You know they don't
let freshman guys

08:31.411 --> 08:33.011
and we're gonna
look like douches.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.114
Please, Jamie-wan Kenobi,
you're our only hope.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.081
Honestly, Cal, you think

08:36.082 --> 08:37.448
I'm gonna
stroll into this party

08:37.450 --> 08:39.018
with a string bean
and a fat farm animal?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.318
Please, please, please,
please, please...

08:40.320 --> 08:41.854
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.522
Woo-hoo!

08:43.523 --> 08:43.822
Under one condition
and you're not gonna like it.
What? What?

08:47.727 --> 08:50.462
You have to bring the bouncer
a gram of coke,

08:50.463 --> 08:51.997
and mother fucking Bob
an eighth of weed.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.099
I don't know
where to get weed, coke.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.503
You're gonna go here,
bring cash and tell them

08:57.504 --> 08:58.937
ping pong girl sent you.

08:58.938 --> 09:02.674
Whatever you do, don't let him
talk about baseball to you.

09:02.675 --> 09:05.611
Meet in the quad here at 7:00
with the stuff and then

09:05.612 --> 09:06.879
we'll walk over there
together.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.480
It's far.
Are you gonna be okay?

09:08.481 --> 09:10.749
Yes.
Woo-hoo, party time!

09:10.750 --> 09:12.885
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.256
Oh, my back.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.057
Oh.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.160
Just for you, hotties.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.131
Oh, my God.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.001
He's gonna die.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.204
<i>Hey,
 out there it's Friday or,</i>

09:32.205 --> 09:34.907
<i>as I like to call it,
 the real hot day.</i>

09:34.908 --> 09:35.174
<i>All right.</i>

09:36.242 --> 09:38.944
Where is the fire, Jewfro?
Pat down.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.317
Jeez man, it's nice
you don't have a girlfriend.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.119
That sucks for you, bro.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.621
What's going on down here?
You want to die
by the time you're 30?

09:49.622 --> 09:51.023
Eat your fiber.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.758
Wait.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.060
Where's your wiener?

09:55.061 --> 09:56.028
You're one of them
lesbians, huh?

09:57.697 --> 09:59.097
No wiener.
Turn around.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.165
It just doesn't like you.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.700
Hey, watch the mouth.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.735
All right, you look
good back here.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.705
Drop your pants.
What?

10:06.706 --> 10:08.240
Time to search
your asshole.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.642
Oh, I don't think so, dude.

10:10.643 --> 10:13.312
Is he good?

10:13.313 --> 10:14.279
Yeah, he's good.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.714
Follow me.

10:19.652 --> 10:23.222
Sit down, be quiet
and don't speak

10:23.223 --> 10:25.190
until you're spoken to.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.488
What?

11:00.159 --> 11:02.294
Very funny, Tom.

11:02.295 --> 11:02.694
You are so...

11:06.132 --> 11:07.666
Oh, you two may go.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.401
We were so scared.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.936
Thank you so much.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.738
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

11:12.739 --> 11:15.140
How dare you!

11:15.141 --> 11:17.175
Oh.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.177
I didn't get to hear about
Joseph Smith.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.712
Oh, God.

11:20.713 --> 11:23.148
What's that?

11:23.149 --> 11:25.117
Oh, no, what is that?

11:25.118 --> 11:28.420
You're a cop?
I'm not a cop.
I'm not a cop. I'm Cal.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.156
He's Cal, Tom.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.758
His name is Cal.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.660
Cal? I'm Mr. Tom.

11:34.661 --> 11:35.727
Hi. This is my beautiful
wife Cherry Lu Rou

11:39.499 --> 11:40.966
and this is my place.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.669
I bought it,
so she'd stop dancing.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.171
And behind you
is monkey boy.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.739
That's monkey boy.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.708
We feed him cocaine
and bananas.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.976
That's his diet, man.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.411
I won him
in a very dangerous game,

11:52.412 --> 11:53.245
Of Huila in Colombia
and he doesn't speak English.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.050
I speak English.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.952
See, look at that...

12:01.854 --> 12:03.589
Ping pong girl
sent me here.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.759
Oh, ping pong girl.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.561
We love ping pong girl.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.463
We love ping pong girl.

12:11.464 --> 12:11.964
Hal, are you my friend?

12:15.168 --> 12:16.568
What?

12:16.569 --> 12:16.802
He wants to know
if you're his friend.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.175
Yes, I'm your friend,
Mr. Tom.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.376
Good.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.711
I love friends.

12:25.712 --> 12:26.712
You want a drink?

12:26.713 --> 12:27.946
You want to talk about
baseball?

12:27.947 --> 12:29.414
Let's talk about baseball.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.116
No, I just need
to get, um--

12:31.117 --> 12:33.518
I just need to get
an eighth of coke

12:33.519 --> 12:35.187
and a gram of weed
or an ounce of weed

12:35.188 --> 12:36.989
or an eighth of coke--
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa whoa.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.390
I don't remember
what I need right now.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.992
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.027
You're freaking me out,
man.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.296
Are you getting nervous?
Hold on.
I'm not nervous.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.732
When you get nervous,
I get nervous and I don't like

12:46.733 --> 12:47.733
to get nervous.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.768
I'm not nervous.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.869
Prove you're not a cop.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.038
I'm not.
Okay, okay,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.706
Bring, bring, bring,
bring me the mirror.

12:54.707 --> 12:55.907
Ow right here.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.209
No, no, no,
no, no, no.
Let's do it.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.111
We are going
to do cocaine.
Yeah.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.812
Put it right here,
put it right here.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.781
I don't think so.
I don't think so,
I've never done it before.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.652
Oh, fuck, I'm wearing
wearing flip flops.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.398
Whoo!

13:19.399 --> 13:20.265
Whoo!

13:21.434 --> 13:23.669
Oh my God, please no,
please no, please no.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.836
I really shouldn't do this.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.038
I really don't feel
like I should do this.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.073
I don't feel like--
You're gonna like it.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.274
You're gonna do it.
You're gonna love it.

13:29.275 --> 13:30.442
You're gonna love it.
You're gonna love it.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.444
Do it, do it, do it.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.513
I got to leave
right after this.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.614
Oh!

13:37.383 --> 13:39.418
You did it!

13:39.419 --> 13:42.554
Oh, my God,
you're my friend.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.222
You're my friend.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.824
My friend!

14:05.244 --> 14:07.279
<i>Bring the bouncer
a gram of coke,</i>

14:07.280 --> 14:10.048
<i>and mother fucking Bob
 an eighth of weed.</i>

14:14.087 --> 14:16.321
Guys, can I just get
my drugs just so I can--

14:16.322 --> 14:17.656
I got to be somewhere.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.824
Get him the drugs.
Get him the drugs.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.058
Where do you have to be?

14:20.059 --> 14:22.294
It's just a college party,
MF Bob's.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.030
Oh! I'm going to MF Bob's house
tonight.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.798
Party,
there's a party there.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.300
I'm meeting a client
there tonight.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.968
Well, I want to go
to that party, Tom.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.270
It's crazy.
He's like a--

14:32.271 --> 14:34.606
Oh, drugs, here they are,
my friend.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.208
Here you go.
That's $600, pal.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.442
$600?
600 bucks?

14:37.443 --> 14:39.911
I only have-- I don't have
600 bucks. I only--

14:39.912 --> 14:42.114
I didn't know drugs
were expensive.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.081
Come on,
give me the money.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.516
I want to go
to the party, Tom.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.450
All right, come on.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.685
I only have $100.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.354
Are you kidding me?
He works for me.

14:49.355 --> 14:52.824
He was over here, he make you
drugs and he came back.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.760
I pay him for that.
shit.

14:54.761 --> 14:58.130
I said I want to go
to the party, Tom.

14:58.131 --> 14:58.430
I want to go to the party.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.134
I have an idea.
Give me the $100.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.805
Give me this.
You keep that, all right?

15:06.806 --> 15:09.174
Here, honey,
you can have that.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.575
Here's what
you're gonna do.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.043
You're gonna
sit right there

15:12.044 --> 15:13.812
and you're gonna
take her to the party,

15:13.813 --> 15:16.348
but you're gonna
wait till she gets dressed.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.783
Okay?
You happy?

15:17.784 --> 15:20.786
Yes.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.888
I love you.
Okay, good.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.056
You watch her
and keep your eyes out

15:25.057 --> 15:26.825
for a Mexican name Cheeba.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.293
He's coming
in from Ridge Crest tonight.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.795
I'm gonna meet him
there later.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.396
Yeah, sure.
Okay, good.

15:31.397 --> 15:33.098
I'm gonna say something to you
and I want you to listen.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.066
If anyone touches,
if anyone touches her,

15:39.205 --> 15:43.141
I'm going to take clippers
and I am going to cut off

15:43.142 --> 15:46.211
your testicles
and I'll feed them to you.

15:46.212 --> 15:50.315
If she gets a splinter-
anything, you know
what I'm gonna do?

15:50.316 --> 15:53.585
I will cut your throat open
and then I'm going to pee

15:53.586 --> 15:55.987
in your eyeballs.
And then I'm going
to open your neck,

15:55.988 --> 15:56.688
I am going to take a shit
inside your fucking neck

16:00.226 --> 16:02.194
and I will fuck your neck.

16:02.195 --> 16:02.327
I will shit rape
your fucking neck!

16:05.798 --> 16:07.599
Do you understand that?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.034
Yes, Mr. Tom.

16:12.305 --> 16:16.274
Oh, sorry, God.
It's the cocaine, man.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.376
I'm sorry.
I was out of my mind,
that's all.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.345
I meant it,
but it was out of line.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.647
You're my friend.
I love this guy.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.984
I love you, Cal.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.587
You're my friend.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.067
I can't believe
we're fucking babysitting

16:42.068 --> 16:43.668
a drug dealer's wife.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.236
I mean, haven't you seen,
I don't know,
<i>Scarface, Pulp Fiction?</i>

16:47.874 --> 16:49.841
This shit
always ends badly.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.909
Look at her, man.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.110
Dude, these are movies, bro.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.945
I'm talking
about real life.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.481
In real life Mr. Tom
is a fucking psycho, dude.

16:56.482 --> 16:57.849
He's psychotic.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.950
His name is probably
not Mr. Tom.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.752
It's probably Keyser Soze.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.854
You know, fuck it,
we're going to the party,
fuck it.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.824
Yeah, man, okay.
As long as we stay out of
trouble and I promised Beth,

17:05.825 --> 17:07.392
I'd stay out of trouble.
Dude, fuck that.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.160
I can't believe you're nuts
are the size of freaking

17:09.161 --> 17:10.328
beach balls
of the baby battery

17:10.329 --> 17:11.630
you got backed up in there.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.064
You try saying that again.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.332
I don't know
what that means, man,

17:14.333 --> 17:15.567
but Beth
is my fiancée, all right.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.935
We're getting married.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.036
Yeah, you're way
too the fuck

17:18.037 --> 17:19.271
young to get married, bro.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.839
Like,
way too fucking young.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.840
Yo, what's up,
shark stain?

17:22.842 --> 17:23.842
Oh, my God.

17:23.843 --> 17:24.976
Hi!

17:24.977 --> 17:26.310
I've missed you so much.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.079
Cherry, what are
you doing here?

17:28.079 --> 17:31.016
Well, Jew-baka over here
was nice enough

17:31.017 --> 17:32.150
to invite me to the party.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.019
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.254
We're actually just talking
about marriage.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.990
Oh, my God. I think you guys
will make such a cute couple.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.926
Like, I'm voting
yes on gay marriage,

17:40.927 --> 17:42.494
so you faggots
can like...

17:45.064 --> 17:47.699
No. This dipshit
is getting engaged.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.335
He hasn't farted
in front of his girlfriend yet.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.337
Dude, what does that have
to do with anything, man?

17:52.338 --> 17:54.005
You haven't farted
in front of your girlfriend.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.073
You can't take
your relationship

17:55.074 --> 17:57.075
to the next level, dude.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.010
Yeah, I mean, like, Tom and I
are so close that only

17:59.011 --> 18:00.612
has he farted
in front of me,

18:00.613 --> 18:01.546
like, I've seen him shit
down some guy's neck.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.317
We should probably
get going, right?

18:07.253 --> 18:09.554
Yeah, it's like a 20 minute
walk to the party, so...

18:09.555 --> 18:11.256
20 minutes away?

18:11.257 --> 18:11.556
Oh, my God, Cal, you can
sit down and rest on the way.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.829
Come on, dude.

18:18.864 --> 18:21.232
Let's go fuck this pig.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.134
I'm like
already tired.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.212
Scribble dibble,

18:34.213 --> 18:36.982
it's Meester live
from mother fucking Bob's.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.216
We're looking for Jamie.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.385
Oh, hey, Jamie,
there she is.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.853
Jamie!

18:41.854 --> 18:43.054
Oh, I'll be right back.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.823
Dude,
are we Eskimo brothers?

18:44.824 --> 18:46.024
Yeah, man.
Come on in, bro.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.025
Good to see you.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.626
Yo, lo--

18:48.627 --> 18:50.028
Where the fuck you think
you guys are going?

18:50.029 --> 18:51.396
Yo,
we're with Jamie, bro.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.164
Dude,
who the fuck is Jamie?

18:53.165 --> 18:55.166
She-- she was right here.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.102
Hey, man, you better
check yourself

18:57.103 --> 18:59.170
before you biggety
wreck yourself.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.839
What the fuck
did you just say?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.774
Nothing, dude,
I'm just kidding.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.743
Damn straight, man,
and I'm gonna have to kick
your fucking ass.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.844
Do you have to?

19:05.845 --> 19:06.845
Yeah, I have to.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.246
Here's the thing.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.949
If you let one fatty
freshman fuck with you

19:10.950 --> 19:12.250
the shit's gonna
go on all year.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.852
It's a matter of principle,
man.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.153
Dude, I'm not really fat.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.821
Yeah, and my dick
isn't 2 inches long.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.289
Thanks God.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.359
So you see, dude,
it's out of my hands, bro.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.628
Hey, hey, hey, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.830
Yeah, these two limp dicks
are my friends.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.332
They're cool, right.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.334
Shit, fellas, why didn't you
say you're with her?

19:29.335 --> 19:31.036
I told you
we're with Jamie, bro.

19:31.037 --> 19:31.469
Dude, who the
fuck is Jamie?

19:32.671 --> 19:34.639
Oh.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.642
You two try not to get
your asses kicked.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.944
Cherry, come with me.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.346
Bye, boys.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.214
But, Cherry, I need
to be watching you.

19:43.215 --> 19:45.183
You got 1000 bucks
to make me wait?
No.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.418
Then see you inside,
suckers.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.121
Yo, you two aren't
going anywhere.

19:52.558 --> 19:53.858
No freshman, boys.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.160
Hey, King Kong cock.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.761
What about that girl?

19:56.762 --> 19:59.364
Dude, the lady show
their titties, man.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.032
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.434
Hong Kong.
Dude, a clown?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.436
Dude, it's a party.
Who doesn't like clowns?

20:07.873 --> 20:10.175
Dude, the world's
most interesting man, really?

20:10.176 --> 20:11.843
Dude,
that's the school principal.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.211
Dean.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.946
I don't give a shit
what his name is.

20:14.947 --> 20:15.947
Whoa, step back.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.282
Get the fuck back.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.355
Dude,
you let those guys in?

20:24.356 --> 20:26.191
Dude, that's the
gay mafia, dude.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.926
The gay fucking mafia.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.795
Oh, you got that stuff?

20:30.796 --> 20:32.864
Oh, damn, oh, dude,
I got something for you.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.865
Yeah?

20:33.866 --> 20:35.867
Te-tee.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.368
Oh, shizites.

20:37.369 --> 20:40.105
Well, I'll tell you
what, you're in,

20:40.106 --> 20:41.840
but your boyfriend
stays outside.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.841
What?
Come on, dude.

20:42.842 --> 20:43.908
Yeah.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.644
Dude, Eskimo brothers.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.646
Oh, dude, you guys
had sex with Jamie?

20:48.647 --> 20:50.682
Yeah, dude, that's makes
us Eskimo brothers.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.851
You know, guys that had sex
with the same girl, dude.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.186
Eskimo brothers are even
tighter than frat bros, man.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.855
You're good.
Oh, Eskimo.

20:56.856 --> 20:57.989
Get in, man, get in.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.298
Oh, oh, oh.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.336
Dude, dude, you didn't tell me
you had sex with Jamie.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.673
Oh, I didn't, bro.

21:15.674 --> 21:18.276
But you just told everyone
that you did.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.445
Yeah, it's called
saving your ass.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.882
Right, but no one's gonna
think that you actually

21:23.883 --> 21:25.250
had sex with Jamie.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.784
Oh, you mean,
people are gonna think

21:26.785 --> 21:28.553
I've had more sex
than I've actually have.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.257
But, dude, now these people
are gonna actually think

21:34.426 --> 21:36.127
that you slept with
her and, you know,

21:36.128 --> 21:38.363
she might find out
and feel...

21:38.364 --> 21:40.899
Dude, talk to me
after you've actually finger

21:40.900 --> 21:42.667
banged a girl, right?

21:42.668 --> 21:44.736
We're at the
best party of the year

21:44.737 --> 21:46.471
and I've only got
two things to do.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.305
One, take care of Cherry.
Two, make sure we get laid.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.378
Oh, my God,
I see titties. Later.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.919
Here,
let me fill that for you.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.887
What?

22:02.888 --> 22:04.155
Unbelievable.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.290
Um...

22:05.291 --> 22:07.892
It's okay, I don't bite.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.361
Hi, I'm Phil.

22:10.362 --> 22:11.896
Loosen up, Phil.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.164
Sorry.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.700
Oh, God,
you probably think I'm...

22:15.701 --> 22:16.000
A nervous freshman
who probably doesn't know

22:19.338 --> 22:20.672
anybody here.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.307
Yeah, actually.

22:22.308 --> 22:25.143
Let me be the first
to officially welcome you

22:25.144 --> 22:26.911
to the campus party scene.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.446
Well, thank you.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.782
You know, I--
I didn't really think

22:30.783 --> 22:33.685
there'd be anyone
so cool to talk to.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.987
Hey, do either one of you want
to buy a white elephant tusk

22:35.988 --> 22:37.288
for really cheap?

22:37.289 --> 22:38.489
Either one of you,
white elephant tusk.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.325
No, nothing?
White elephant tusk.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.459
Hey, would you maybe,
I don't know,

22:43.229 --> 22:44.862
want to head
into the kitchen

22:44.863 --> 22:46.364
and talk for a little bit?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.832
Bro, what are you still
doing here?

22:47.833 --> 22:50.401
It's like boob fest
3000 out there

22:50.402 --> 22:52.170
and I lost Cherry.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.072
If I don't find her,
I'm gonna get
shit on and raped.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.707
Shit raped, man.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.076
Dude, I'm kind of right
in the middle of talking

22:58.077 --> 22:59.110
to Polly here.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.113
Dude, I need you now.

23:02.114 --> 23:02.547
Okay, 5 minutes,
in the kitchen?

23:05.884 --> 23:07.085
I'll be waiting.

23:12.691 --> 23:16.694
Dude, that was Polly
fucking Wallace.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.696
I'm not saying that just
to emphasize a point.

23:18.697 --> 23:19.597
Her nickname is fucking.
Polly fucking Wallace, bro.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.702
You're getting
laid tonight.

23:24.703 --> 23:26.137
Well, what are you
talking about, man?

23:26.138 --> 23:27.839
I'm not trying
to get laid here.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.209
That's what you think, dude.
She's a sure thing. Watch.

23:31.210 --> 23:31.576
Bro, dude,
I just have one question.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.115
Who here
is in my Eskimo network?

23:37.116 --> 23:38.716
Who's had sex
with Polly Wallace?

23:38.717 --> 23:39.984
Yeah, I did.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.987
Absolutely.

23:42.988 --> 23:44.222
Dude,
even the Dean's rocked it.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.293
You're getting laid.

23:48.294 --> 23:51.062
Dude, seriously,
all we're doing is talking.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.898
No way, bro,
she's cock crazy.

23:53.899 --> 23:55.199
She gonna get you drunk

23:55.200 --> 23:57.001
and ride you like a rodeo,
brother.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.236
Whoo!

23:58.237 --> 23:59.704
Now we go to go
find Cherry.

23:59.705 --> 24:03.308
Uh, but before
that I am going to stick

24:03.309 --> 24:06.711
my penis in that
nice little girl walking by.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.913
Phil, Cal,
what's up, guys?

24:08.914 --> 24:10.415
Hey, what's up, Hensen?

24:10.416 --> 24:12.150
Fuck off, Hensen.
We can't be seen with you here.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.719
You're a funny guy.
See you later.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.721
Dude, that was
for the best.

24:16.722 --> 24:19.390
Fucking Hensen
is a loser, bro.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.793
When chicks see him
they get dry.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.028
Now come on, go fucking
drain your nuts.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.798
Dude, for the last time,
I'm not gonna fuck Polly.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.399
You need to fuck
Polly Wallace.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.901
Go do some talking
with your dick,

24:29.902 --> 24:30.902
don't be a fag.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.471
What did you say?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.073
Yeah, what did you say?

24:35.074 --> 24:36.708
Yeah, what did you say?

24:36.709 --> 24:38.910
Uh, I was just talking
to my buddy Phil here,

24:38.911 --> 24:40.211
<i>ot you ga-- guys.</i>

24:40.212 --> 24:42.447
You think
it's okay to say fag?

24:42.448 --> 24:44.315
You better not have been
talking to me.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.150
Look, he didn't mean
anything by it.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.719
What exactly did he mean?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.187
Yeah, what did he mean?

24:49.188 --> 24:50.822
It's just
a term of endearment.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.390
Like when black people
call each other the "N" word

24:52.391 --> 24:55.426
And just what "N" word
would that be?

24:55.427 --> 24:56.928
Oh, yes, say it.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.696
I think he's saying
that they're gay.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.701
Yes.
We're gay.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.269
We're gay, gay, gay, gay.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.371
You're gay, honey?
You don't look gay.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.972
I've been gay since '98.

25:07.973 --> 25:10.475
Yeah, trust me, he's gay.

25:10.476 --> 25:13.911
He's, like-- like
my girlfriend and I'm the,

25:13.912 --> 25:16.147
you know, like,
the boyfriend.
Tweet-tweet.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.416
Really?
Uh-huh.

25:18.417 --> 25:19.917
Then kiss him.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.119
What?
Well, yeah, kiss
him, kiss him.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.186
Yeah, do that.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.821
What?
Fuck, no way.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.324
Look, we-- we don't do
that in public, you know.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.426
I just had garlic, man.
Yeah.

25:28.427 --> 25:30.294
Kiss him!

25:30.295 --> 25:31.729
Kiss him!

25:35.134 --> 25:36.534
Okay, yeah.

25:42.741 --> 25:45.910
Oh, isn't that sweet?

25:45.911 --> 25:47.145
Works for me.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.346
Oh!

25:48.347 --> 25:48.813
I told you faggots,
you made a cute couple.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.986
I love homosexuals.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.058
Dude, that was
really scary, man.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.834
You put your tongue
in my mouth, dude.

26:09.835 --> 26:11.769
Dude, what the hell
was I supposed to do?

26:11.770 --> 26:14.405
It was the gay mafia.
It had to look realistic.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.041
You'll clean my life out.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.260
Hey.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.695
Hey.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.797
I've been waiting for you.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.032
You okay?

26:42.034 --> 26:43.668
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

26:43.669 --> 26:46.604
It's just I think
I pounded that last drink

26:46.605 --> 26:49.340
a little bit too quickly.

26:49.341 --> 26:52.076
I could really stand
to get something in me
right now, actually.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.010
Oh, my God. I would love to get
a little something in me, too.

26:56.849 --> 26:57.915
You know what sounds
really, really good?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.888
Um, what's that?

27:03.889 --> 27:05.523
Bacon.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.290
I love bacon.

27:07.593 --> 27:10.194
After that everything
pretty much went black.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.101
I mean, that's all
I really remember.

27:20.706 --> 27:23.441
Yeah,
that's mostly right,

27:23.442 --> 27:25.710
but I remember it
more like this.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.430
No, dude, I'm gonna
stop you right there

27:46.431 --> 27:48.199
'cause that is not
how shit went down.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.636
Fine. Dude, I remember
as much as you remember.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.071
I mean, someone slipped
something in our drinks

27:54.072 --> 27:55.706
or some shit.

27:55.707 --> 27:57.008
Well, dude, we got
to figure it out, all right,

27:57.009 --> 27:58.876
because Beth's gonna be
here any minute

27:58.877 --> 28:01.846
and I need to know if I slept
with Polly or not.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.114
We know
what happened, dude.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.749
You laid the lumber.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.385
I don't think so, man.
I think I'd remember sex.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.886
We got dosed, man.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.988
I don't even know
where Cherry is.

28:10.989 --> 28:14.158
I'm probably moments away
from getting shit raped

28:14.159 --> 28:15.726
and murdered by Mr. Tom.

28:15.727 --> 28:16.294
I just-- I need to know
what happened last night

28:19.565 --> 28:21.098
for sure.

28:21.099 --> 28:22.900
Oh, I get it, dude.

28:22.901 --> 28:25.169
You don't want to
give her the syphilo,

28:25.170 --> 28:26.337
the syphilitis.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.338
No.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.339
Yo, Cal!

28:28.340 --> 28:30.341
Yo, Eskimo.

28:30.342 --> 28:33.411
Uh, yo.

28:33.412 --> 28:34.812
Yo.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.581
Hey, I heard you needed
some help, man.

28:36.582 --> 28:37.915
I brought Georgia here.

28:37.916 --> 28:41.152
She's got like
a pornographic memory.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.788
Photographic memory
and there's no such thing.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.489
See, pretty and smart,
huh.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.759
Yeah, she is hot.

28:48.760 --> 28:52.496
Hey, have you
guys seen a phone?
No.

28:52.497 --> 28:53.965
Jesus, what happened
to your shoulder?

28:53.966 --> 28:56.834
Look, don't worry about
my shoulder, George.

28:56.835 --> 28:58.636
Okay, here's
the fucking scoop.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.771
Phil,
his girlfriend's coming.

29:00.772 --> 29:03.441
He woke up naked with
no clothes in bed with Polly

29:03.442 --> 29:04.775
fucking Wallace.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.711
Dude, you need a shot.
How is your dick?

29:06.712 --> 29:08.412
A little bit of itching,
a little burning?

29:08.413 --> 29:09.447
Can I see it?

29:09.448 --> 29:11.916
No.
No, ma'am.

29:11.917 --> 29:12.183
I don't feel comfortable
discussing my penis

29:15.654 --> 29:17.555
with someone I just met.

29:17.556 --> 29:18.990
I told you, bro,
you don't need an expert.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.591
You're already
scratch-a-thon.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.093
Dude, I don't need
to scratch.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.329
It's just 'cause you keep
putting that in my head.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.665
Let's just get back to
what happened, all right.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.467
Do you have any idea?

29:29.468 --> 29:32.603
Oh, man, I don't remember much
because I was pretty trashed,

29:32.604 --> 29:35.072
but here's
what I remember.

29:35.073 --> 29:35.973
It was me at the door
and wall to wall bitches,

29:39.511 --> 29:40.911
every single one of them.

29:40.912 --> 29:42.346
I love you, Beef.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.816
Well, a lot of ladies do.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.352
Just go ahead and wait
inside and stand in line

29:48.353 --> 29:49.654
with the rest of them.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.522
I'd wait all night
if I had to.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.657
I'm sure you would.

29:52.658 --> 29:54.191
You sexy beast.

29:54.192 --> 29:55.660
Yo, you two can't come in.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.063
Oh.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.232
Sorry, these two ass
monkeys are with me.

30:04.369 --> 30:06.370
Hey, who is that hottie?

30:06.371 --> 30:08.406
Oh, thanks, handsome.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.440
Bye, boys.

30:11.376 --> 30:14.378
But I thought she was...

30:14.379 --> 30:15.579
What?

30:15.580 --> 30:17.181
You thought
she was with you?

30:17.182 --> 30:19.917
Well, you know, once,
like, a long time ago.

30:19.918 --> 30:22.853
No, dude, it just means that
you're in my Eskimo network,

30:22.854 --> 30:24.355
you know, two guys
that are banging

30:24.356 --> 30:25.523
the same girl, man.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.358
It's all good.
Yeah, dude.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.392
Whoo!

30:28.393 --> 30:29.360
Glenn.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.463
Glenn.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.365
He tastes like beef jerky.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.367
I do.

30:36.368 --> 30:37.501
Glenn.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.537
What?
Wait, I love you.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.439
I love you.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.840
Okay.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.608
Glenn, come here, man.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.211
Hmm?

30:52.384 --> 30:54.018
Bye.
Who's that?

30:54.019 --> 30:55.886
I don't know who that was.

30:55.887 --> 30:57.888
Oh, man. Well, dude,
you up for a game
of assketball?

30:57.889 --> 30:59.156
You know it, brosef.

30:59.157 --> 31:01.292
Hells yeah.
Hey, Derek.
Yo.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.360
Come watch the door,
man, I'll be back in ten.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.395
Oh, yeah.

31:04.396 --> 31:05.362

31:06.932 --> 31:09.900
You're cute.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.504
And you're just the
right amount of drunk.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.846
Hey, Glenn,
give those M&Ms, man.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.199
Hey, I got this for you.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.200
What?

31:43.201 --> 31:44.735
Just drink it.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.604
I bet Meester here
can chug the whole thing

31:46.605 --> 31:47.671
in under 5 seconds.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.607
Don't make me pay him.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.375
Chug it, Beef.

31:51.376 --> 31:52.476
Oh, wow.

31:57.182 --> 32:00.384
Hope you got
that for your stupid movie.

32:00.385 --> 32:01.585
I did.

32:06.491 --> 32:07.625
Oh, my God.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.693
You have such amazing eyes.

32:09.694 --> 32:10.594
My tits are down here,
asshole.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.798
Mother--

32:15.033 --> 32:16.600
Hey, babe, it's me.

32:18.370 --> 32:21.138
So I got the wedding
colors picked out already.

32:21.139 --> 32:24.475
I think I'm gonna pick lavender
and white because,

32:24.476 --> 32:26.677
you know, those are
my favorite colors.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.379
Let me know what you think.
Bye.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.753
Hey, man, what's up, Beef?

32:35.754 --> 32:37.922
Hey, give us
some of that candy, man.

32:37.923 --> 32:39.790
I can't, man, I got to use it
for something.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.058
Use it?
What the fuck?

32:41.059 --> 32:44.862
Hey, man, share some
of that candy.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.597
Dude, this isn't
Casablanca babes,

32:46.598 --> 32:49.767
Stop bogartin'

32:49.768 --> 32:53.137
Hey, you want to get high?

32:53.138 --> 32:55.606
Hell, man, there's a priest
molesting little boys,

32:55.607 --> 32:56.740

32:56.741 --> 32:57.775
Hey, give them some candy.

32:57.776 --> 33:00.010
Yeah, candy.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.595
You know about stereotypes?

33:17.596 --> 33:21.432
You know how that black guys
only like that white chicks?

33:21.433 --> 33:24.435
What if black guys don't
really like fat white chicks

33:24.436 --> 33:26.237
but they like frozen
Snickers bars,

33:26.238 --> 33:29.340
and fat white chicks always
has frozen Snickers bars?

33:30.075 --> 33:32.877
That shit is racist, man.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.247
Hey, man, you're fucking
racist, mother fucker.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.016
Hey, Jamal, what did
you get on your SATs?

33:39.017 --> 33:41.719
I don't know, man,
barbeque sauce.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.258
Oh, there she is.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.759
Fuck you asshole face.

33:50.795 --> 33:53.797
And I want my abortion
money tonight.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.432
Yeah, asshole face.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.701
Yo, man, I never
went inside her, man.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.036
I went in her eyes.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.070
She probably didn't see
that coming.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.144
What happened?

34:07.145 --> 34:09.112
Hey, man, who listens
to music in a party, dude?

34:09.114 --> 34:10.947
Hey, man, give me
more candy.

34:10.949 --> 34:12.483
I can't, man, I need it
for something, man.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.851
Come on, Glenn,
let's get out of here

34:13.851 --> 34:14.952
and get that little pudwacker.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.453
Thanks for the weed, guys.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.121
All right stereotypical
white dude.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.226
Hold on, man,
hold on, hold on.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.728
All jokes aside, man,
where the fuck is our bong?

34:25.730 --> 34:28.632
Oh, shit,
where is our bong, man?

34:28.632 --> 34:29.667
It disappeared.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.806
Do you guys want
to buy this bong for $50?

34:35.806 --> 34:37.708
Oh, yeah, yeah,
we'll buy it, ma'am.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.443
Awesome.

34:39.444 --> 34:41.712
I got $60 right here.
Good.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.647
Thank you.

34:43.648 --> 34:44.949
Can I get my change please?

34:44.949 --> 34:46.650
I don't do change.
I'm so sorry.

34:46.650 --> 34:47.518
It's just like our old one.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.955
Oh, my God, Tiffany.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.658
My name is not Tiffany.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.659
It's Cherry, you bitch.

34:56.661 --> 34:56.793
Oh!

34:58.196 --> 35:00.197
Look at your face.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.801
Die, dog, die.

35:06.838 --> 35:07.137
I think it's broken.

35:08.206 --> 35:10.808
This is a decimal
right here.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.884
Hey, Phil, it's me again.

35:20.885 --> 35:23.053
So I was thinking
we should go out

35:23.054 --> 35:24.989
to a really
nice restaurant tomorrow

35:24.990 --> 35:26.256
and I think
it'll be really cool

35:26.257 --> 35:28.959
if you propose to me again
in front of everyone.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.661
Doesn't that sound awesome?

35:30.662 --> 35:32.296
Okay, call me back, babe.

35:34.399 --> 35:36.700
So my doctor
strongly advised

35:36.701 --> 35:38.902
that I should get my penis
reduction sooner,

35:38.903 --> 35:39.937
rather than later.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.205
Yeah.

35:41.206 --> 35:43.507
What's your name?

35:43.508 --> 35:44.875
Pilar.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.711
Pilar, I'm Cal.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.513
Hi.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.119
Guess what?

35:55.120 --> 35:57.688
We should really get you
out of these wet clothes.

36:04.229 --> 36:07.264
You know what,
I bet your dad was a thief

36:07.265 --> 36:09.299
because he stole
the stars in the skies

36:09.300 --> 36:11.001
and put them in your eyes.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.438
My daddy was shot
and killed while stealing

36:14.439 --> 36:17.241
from a jewelry store,
you asshole.

36:18.443 --> 36:20.511
What the--

36:25.050 --> 36:26.417
Is everyone okay up there?

36:26.418 --> 36:28.185
<i>Yeah,
 but you shot a dog.</i>

36:28.186 --> 36:29.887
Oh, it's not my first.
Is it still alive?

36:29.888 --> 36:33.057
<i>Yeah, it's still moving.</i>

36:33.058 --> 36:34.391
How about now?

36:34.392 --> 36:36.894
<i>Yeah, that did it,
 it's dead.</i>

36:36.895 --> 36:38.896
Just put
the bottle down, man.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.100
Hey, why don't
we go do a tarot reading.
I'll charge you, but...

36:43.101 --> 36:45.836
Do you know how degrading
it is to come to a party

36:45.837 --> 36:46.503
where you're hired as a clown
and find your ex girlfriend

36:49.908 --> 36:51.141
here with someone?

36:51.142 --> 36:53.310
You cheated
on me multiple times

36:53.311 --> 36:53.510
with the moms
from your birthday party gigs.

36:56.915 --> 36:57.748
You back off, man.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.051
Oh, my God.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.456
My hero.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.291
I am gonna take
such good care of you.
Rawr!

37:11.296 --> 37:14.465
Now somebody get that
clown the hell out of here.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.703
So that was weird.

37:19.704 --> 37:21.872
I thought it was
pretty cool what he did.

37:21.873 --> 37:24.141
Well, I mean, I totally
could have kicked that

37:24.142 --> 37:25.342
clown's ass,
but, you know,

37:25.343 --> 37:26.910
Phil had the sitch
under control.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.312
Mm.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.913
My sorority sisters are
waiting for me upstairs,

37:29.914 --> 37:31.915
let's go.
Oh, hell yeah.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.918
I really want
to screw that guy.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.453
Me too.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.728
Okay, well,
your lifeline is very short,

37:44.729 --> 37:47.231
but there's nothing I can
really do about that, all right?

37:47.232 --> 37:49.066
Do you have
any other questions?

37:49.067 --> 37:51.902
Um, what about
my love life?

37:51.903 --> 37:53.137
Your love life?
Okay.

37:53.138 --> 37:55.072
Well, I hate
to tell you this,

37:55.073 --> 37:56.473
but your boyfriend
is fucking everybody.

37:56.474 --> 37:59.143
Everybody, he fucks
everything with vagina.

37:59.144 --> 38:00.911
I know.
It's terrible.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.212
Are you kidding me?

38:02.213 --> 38:03.747
He's supposed to be
at bible study.

38:03.748 --> 38:06.283
Bible study? No.
He is not at bible study.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.318
No, no. You know what
I would do if I were you?

38:08.319 --> 38:11.255
I would find the ugliest,
most repulsive

38:11.256 --> 38:11.755
looking person at this party
and screw him.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.394
Thank you.
I will.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.067
Is this marijuana
you're smoking?

38:24.068 --> 38:26.603
Is this marijuana,
you're...

38:26.604 --> 38:28.272
yes.
Why?

38:28.273 --> 38:28.672
I'm not comfortable with you
smoking drugs around us.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.911
Okay, come here.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.913
Closer.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.381
Say please.

38:37.382 --> 38:40.050
Please.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.456
All right, why don't
we all move on

38:46.457 --> 38:47.658
to the Ouija board?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.092
Okay?

38:49.093 --> 38:50.527
This is not
what I was expecting.

38:50.528 --> 38:51.995
Oh! Ooh.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.866
Rusty coke pipes,

38:55.867 --> 38:58.135
that means it's time to switch
to heroin everybody.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.403
Take over.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.704
I'm gonna go find
a bathroom.

39:00.705 --> 39:02.039
Jamie, hi.

39:06.077 --> 39:07.311
Hello, Jamie.

39:07.312 --> 39:08.745
So Cherry's got you guys

39:08.746 --> 39:10.747
playing with the dark hearts,
huh?

39:10.748 --> 39:12.916
We're gonna Ouija.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.251
Actually I have a question.

39:14.252 --> 39:14.785
Um, will I have sex
with Elaine?

39:18.089 --> 39:19.923
Yes, I will.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.558
You did that, totally.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.160
No, no, that wasn't me.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.728
Um, here let me try again.

39:24.729 --> 39:27.931
Will I have sex
with Marilyn?

39:27.932 --> 39:29.933
Yes, I will.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.034
You did that.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.336
No, I swear it wasn't me.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.570
Will I have sex with Jamie?

39:36.841 --> 39:38.041
No.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.011
Will I have a threesome
with Elaine and Marilyn?

39:44.449 --> 39:46.617
Yes, I will.
Wow.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.785
Oh, my God, I think
it actually moved that time.

39:48.786 --> 39:51.622
You guys know that
whatever the Ouija board says

39:51.623 --> 39:52.089
you have to do, no matter
how freaky or kinky or gross,

39:55.493 --> 39:56.760
you have to do it.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.962
It's like a thing,
like a law.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.063
It's true.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.231
Oh, my God, really?

40:01.232 --> 40:02.466
Yeah.

40:02.467 --> 40:03.767
I guess we have
to do it then.

40:03.768 --> 40:04.968
Sounds like
we should get a room.

40:04.969 --> 40:05.969
Mm.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.104
Let's go.

40:21.686 --> 40:21.852
All right, I'm gonna
find us a room.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.722
Sex, sex, sex, sex,
sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.

40:29.460 --> 40:33.230
Do you know,
my boyfriend thinks that

40:33.231 --> 40:33.797
he is the only one
whom he gets to play.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.835
Well, I'll show him.

40:38.836 --> 40:40.704
Yes!

40:44.042 --> 40:46.243
Oh, I can't believe
this is actually happening.

40:46.244 --> 40:47.344
No, it sure is, Peter!

40:47.345 --> 40:49.012
It's Cal.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.414
Ow.

40:50.415 --> 40:52.249
Oh!
This isn't working.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.583
Move over.

40:53.584 --> 40:55.852
Yes.
Get up you fat phone!

40:55.853 --> 40:58.855
Right, so wiggle a little so
I can pull your pants off.

40:58.856 --> 40:59.189
Oh, shit.
Red alert! Red alert!

41:03.061 --> 41:05.228
Oh, shit. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:05.229 --> 41:08.265
Let me get a condom
and a towel, we'll
try over again.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.933
Oh, fuck.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.501
Please give me a condom.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.372
There's a drunk
chick in there.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.507
I'm going to testify
that she was sober.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.343
Dude, I don't use
condoms, man.

41:19.344 --> 41:20.510
Go, go check the bathroom.

41:20.511 --> 41:21.878
Okay, okay.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.580
Uh, I will find us
a room, let's go.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.790
Oh, this so works.
Hold on.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.260
Oh, bro.

41:40.865 --> 41:43.066
Ladies, hold on.
Dude.

41:45.737 --> 41:48.271
Hey, what the fuck?
I was taking
a shit, man.

41:48.272 --> 41:49.573
Come on.

41:49.574 --> 41:50.874
Who shits with
the door open?

41:50.875 --> 41:52.876
Okay, ladies,
hold on, hold on.

41:53.778 --> 41:56.713
Oh, my God I swear
I will find us a room.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.785
I will.

42:01.786 --> 42:04.254
Please I need you you in there
like fucking stat.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.856
Oh, wait.

42:09.494 --> 42:10.861
Come on, get in here.

42:10.862 --> 42:11.962
What?

42:11.963 --> 42:13.463
Where?
What?

42:13.464 --> 42:15.665
Oh, dude,
thanks for sharing, man.
Sharing?

42:15.666 --> 42:17.334
Don't you know
who the fuck this is?

42:17.335 --> 42:19.503
This is Mr. Tom's wife.

42:19.504 --> 42:21.171
Oh, fuck, dude.

42:21.172 --> 42:23.273
I don't want anything to do
with this shit, man.

42:23.274 --> 42:24.574
It's too late, bro.

42:24.575 --> 42:25.842
I'm supposed to be
watching her.

42:25.843 --> 42:27.277
Mr. Tom's gonna be
here any minute.

42:27.278 --> 42:28.745
If she dies, I die

42:28.746 --> 42:31.014
and then bonus,
I get shit raped.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.482
Oh, fuck you, dude.

42:32.483 --> 42:33.817
You keep this bitch alive.

42:33.818 --> 42:36.353
If I see Mr. Tom
I'll distract him.

42:36.354 --> 42:38.255
Fake ass Eskimo brother.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.257
Fuck.

42:40.258 --> 42:41.858
Oh, man.
Goddamn it.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.262
Mr. B is on move.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.498
What?

42:48.499 --> 42:49.900
Later with that.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.601
Oh, my God, you're Mr. Belding
from <i>Saved by the Bell.</i>

42:54.072 --> 42:55.739
Well, actually
my name is Dennis Haskins

42:55.740 --> 42:57.474
but I did play
Mr. Belding.

42:57.475 --> 42:59.276
Yeah, I know, I know.
You're like my hero.

42:59.277 --> 43:00.477
I got this.

43:00.478 --> 43:01.945
I need some advice.

43:01.946 --> 43:03.080
Okay, shoot.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.514
All right.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.183
I'm really drunk right now

43:06.184 --> 43:08.351
and inside the bathroom
is a drug dealer's wife.

43:08.352 --> 43:09.786
Mr. Tom's wife
is in there.

43:09.787 --> 43:11.288
She may have overdosed
and she may be dead.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.423
What do I do?

43:13.424 --> 43:14.891
You got a beeper?

43:14.892 --> 43:16.293
No.

43:16.294 --> 43:17.894
Rotary dial phone?

43:17.895 --> 43:19.029
No.

43:19.030 --> 43:20.664
VCR, VHS,

43:20.665 --> 43:22.766
maybe a floppy disk,
eight track.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.402
Zack phone, pencil, paper clip.
Help me out here.

43:25.403 --> 43:27.270
No,
this isn't the '90s, bro.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.772
I don't have
any of that stuff.

43:28.773 --> 43:31.608
Well, looks like
you're in quite a predicament

43:31.609 --> 43:33.276
and I'm not gonna be
able to help you.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.078
But, you know what though?

43:38.583 --> 43:38.882
I suggest
that you drink this really fast

43:42.286 --> 43:43.653
and then pass out.

43:43.654 --> 43:45.455
Yeah.

43:47.358 --> 43:48.692
Uh.

43:48.693 --> 43:51.328
Thanks, Mr. Belding--
I mean, Dennis.

44:05.443 --> 44:07.277
And...

44:07.278 --> 44:09.613
that's all I remember.

44:09.614 --> 44:12.349
Dude,
Mr. Belding was not there.

44:12.350 --> 44:14.417
No, Mr. Belding,
no Zack Morris,

44:14.418 --> 44:16.386
<i>o Jessy Spano, bro.</i>

44:16.387 --> 44:17.687
Dude, that's all
I remember, man,

44:17.688 --> 44:20.524
except waking up
next to this angel.

44:20.525 --> 44:22.292
You know,
I prefer Tinkerbell, baby.

44:22.293 --> 44:23.527
All right, guys, listen.

44:23.528 --> 44:23.760
Me, Polly, no memory.

44:27.298 --> 44:28.598
Girlfriend coming to town.

44:28.599 --> 44:30.367
Can we please
just stay on track?

44:31.736 --> 44:33.803
♪ Hey-ho,
pick up your phone ♪

44:33.804 --> 44:34.804
Oh.

44:34.805 --> 44:36.406
Dude, Brah Man.

44:37.408 --> 44:38.775
What's up, dude?

44:38.776 --> 44:40.710
Hey, dude, I'm here
with Cal and Phil, man.

44:40.711 --> 44:43.647
You remember Mexican Jonah Hill
and Neil Patrick Harris?

44:43.648 --> 44:43.914
No, dude, he looks like
walking HIV, dude.

44:47.385 --> 44:48.752
I was thinking, man...

44:48.753 --> 44:50.554
Man, he's either in the movie
<i>Philadelphia</i>

44:50.555 --> 44:52.222
or we need to go
to the hospital right now,

44:52.223 --> 44:53.390
you know.

44:53.391 --> 44:56.026
Yeah, dude, you remember me,
right, Brah Man.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.595
I'm the one you
kept calling Chia Pet.

44:58.596 --> 44:58.728
Wait, no, you're the one that
looks like a gigantic frijole

45:02.200 --> 45:03.767
with an afro bro, right?

45:03.768 --> 45:04.768
<i>Well, that's me.</i>

45:04.769 --> 45:06.236
Holy fucking shit.

45:06.237 --> 45:08.872
Oh, man, I totally
remember those guys, man.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.974
We were at the party,
dude and it's like--

45:10.975 --> 45:14.211
it was a complete tit fest,
dude, and we were getting high--

45:14.212 --> 45:16.813
And these extreme
astrophysical effects

45:16.814 --> 45:19.182
can lead to short
bursts of fusion

45:19.183 --> 45:20.383
and that's my first lesson
in fusion science.

45:22.186 --> 45:24.254
Oh, my God.
You are the smartest man ever.

45:27.725 --> 45:28.725
Thank you.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.093
And the sexiest.

45:30.094 --> 45:31.928
Yeah, I am.

45:31.929 --> 45:35.198
Hey, you're
my greatest customer ever.
I never do this.

45:35.199 --> 45:38.735
but here's a rebate check
for $20,000

45:38.736 --> 45:41.338
and I also want to give you
these beautiful ladies.

45:42.974 --> 45:44.641
Oh, my God.

45:47.945 --> 45:51.114
Brah Man, you're the coolest man
in our solar system.

45:51.115 --> 45:51.715
Yeah, Brah Man,
you're beautiful inside and out.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.353
I sure am.

46:07.932 --> 46:10.667
Yes, um,
that's all I remember, man.

46:10.668 --> 46:13.637
Dude, that is not
how anything happened.

46:13.638 --> 46:15.105
Are you fucking
kidding me?

46:15.106 --> 46:17.040
This guy probably
can't even drive straight.

46:17.041 --> 46:18.942
Fuck you, man,
I'm not an idiot.

46:18.943 --> 46:21.011
<i>I'm Asian, dude.
 I'm smarter than you, man.</i>

46:21.012 --> 46:23.213
<i>Fuck you and your fucking
 lumber cut Beatle's haircut.</i>

46:23.214 --> 46:26.316
Hey, man, fuck you,you
walking big brown
piece of shit, man.

46:26.317 --> 46:28.018
I know Yakuza, bro.

46:28.019 --> 46:29.719
Oh, shit.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.656
Mother fucker, fuck.

46:32.657 --> 46:34.224
Talk to me like that...

46:34.225 --> 46:36.960
Well, it sounds like
you're fucked.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.828
Or at least
you were last night.

46:38.829 --> 46:39.462
Get thee to a healer
before the burning starts, man.

46:42.667 --> 46:43.700
Jamie.

46:43.701 --> 46:45.402
Meester, cute outfit.

46:45.403 --> 46:46.102
Oh, scribble dibble.

46:48.205 --> 46:49.706
You guys see
a video camera?

46:51.676 --> 46:52.742
I can't find it.

46:52.743 --> 46:53.977
No, I haven't seen it

46:53.978 --> 46:56.046
but have you seen a phone
by chance?

46:56.047 --> 46:59.449
You shit stains, I told you
to stay out of trouble.

46:59.450 --> 47:02.419
One party and you need
your momma to come here

47:02.420 --> 47:04.054
and wipe your asses?
Me-me-me!

47:04.055 --> 47:04.287
Jamie, just please
tell us what happened.

47:07.491 --> 47:08.892
Okay.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.293
I'll tell you
what happened.

47:10.294 --> 47:12.195
First your daddy
forgot to pull out.

47:12.196 --> 47:13.963
Then he dropped
in your fucking head

47:13.964 --> 47:15.432
a couple of times.

47:15.433 --> 47:16.866
And then
he forgot to teach you

47:16.867 --> 47:18.668
how to man up
and drink a beer.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.804
And now I have to come here
and clean up this entire mess.

47:20.805 --> 47:22.138
So Phil's girlfriend
will leave everyone

47:22.139 --> 47:23.907
on campus
the fuck alone.

47:23.908 --> 47:26.209
Oh, Beth, is she here?

47:26.210 --> 47:29.412
Apparently, she's already
torn up the entire dorms

47:29.413 --> 47:30.413
looking for you.

47:30.414 --> 47:32.682
Now I'm fucked.

47:32.683 --> 47:33.683
Fucked.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.085
What's the problem?

47:35.086 --> 47:37.053
Well, according
to Beef over there,

47:37.054 --> 47:37.821
Phil stuck his dick
in a VD cocktail last night.

47:41.025 --> 47:42.659
Beef?

47:42.660 --> 47:43.860
Beef?

47:43.861 --> 47:45.295
Needledick
the bug fucker

47:45.296 --> 47:48.431
was completely fucking
trash last night.

47:48.432 --> 47:50.233
Hey, so were you.

47:50.234 --> 47:52.202
I was with Meester all night
and we were only half trashed.

47:52.203 --> 47:55.338
So together we can totally
piece together the real deal.

47:55.339 --> 47:56.873
It's true.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.675
So, Helen Keller.
Need a braille book?

47:58.676 --> 48:00.677
What the fuck happened?
Yeah!

48:00.678 --> 48:02.245
This is how shit
went down.

48:02.246 --> 48:05.749
I showed up at the party
looking insanely gorgeous.

48:05.750 --> 48:08.685
I mean, seriously amazing.

48:08.686 --> 48:10.086
Jamie, Jamie.

48:10.087 --> 48:12.222
You two pricks wait here
for one second.

48:16.727 --> 48:17.827
Did you get the stuff?

48:17.828 --> 48:19.162
Yeah, sure.

48:19.163 --> 48:20.797
Not that, you fuck,
with the money.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.832
Oh. Yeah, yeah,
sure thing, yeah.

48:22.833 --> 48:24.067
Oh, we're with Jamie, bro.

48:24.068 --> 48:25.668
Pricks.
I'll be right back.

48:25.669 --> 48:26.669
Okay, see you inside.

48:26.670 --> 48:28.004
Okay.

48:28.005 --> 48:30.140
Beef, they're my friends.

48:32.042 --> 48:34.978
Oh, Jamie,
these guys are with you?

48:34.979 --> 48:36.780
I didn't know that.
Of course, they're welcome.

48:36.781 --> 48:38.548
Of course, they're welcome.
You're the best.

48:38.549 --> 48:42.185
Aww. You guys try not to get
your asses kicked, just try.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.989
I thought you knew
we were with Jamie.

48:48.692 --> 48:49.692
Ow!

48:49.693 --> 48:51.327
Jamie.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.173
Hey.

49:59.697 --> 50:01.030
Be sure
that door is locked.

50:01.031 --> 50:02.699
If somebody walks in,
the price doubles.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.701
Okay.

50:04.702 --> 50:05.768
Locked.

50:05.769 --> 50:07.403
Oh, my God.
Wow.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.512
Ladies and gentlemen--
who am I kidding?

50:15.513 --> 50:17.847
The only people watching
this are frat guys.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.516
All right, let's get it moving,
Seacrest.

50:19.517 --> 50:22.552
You've seen the rest,
now check out the best.

50:22.553 --> 50:23.286
The most insane thing
you've ever seen in your life.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.525
Okay, are you ready,
we're rolling?

50:28.526 --> 50:29.726
Yeah, we're rolling.
All right, perfect.

50:29.727 --> 50:30.727
Bring me a beer.

50:30.728 --> 50:31.995
All right.

50:31.996 --> 50:33.229
Meester.

50:35.466 --> 50:36.799
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

50:36.800 --> 50:40.003
Holy shit,
I had no idea.

50:40.004 --> 50:43.106
I just thought
you wanted more beer.

50:43.107 --> 50:44.841
Oh, give me a hug,
girl, this is amazing.

50:44.842 --> 50:46.309
Hold on a sec, cowboy,

50:46.310 --> 50:47.944
<i>o hugging till the talent
gets her pants on.</i>

50:47.945 --> 50:49.612
Oh, you know
I'm gay, right?

50:49.613 --> 50:52.515
Yeah, I just didn't want you
to get all perioded on.

50:52.516 --> 50:54.150
All right.

50:54.151 --> 50:55.151
Oh, my there's some of
your junk in the cup.

50:58.322 --> 50:59.722
Oh.

50:59.723 --> 51:00.723
Oh, my God.

51:00.724 --> 51:02.058
Let's go a two-fer

51:02.059 --> 51:04.727
on the YouTube delights
for tonight.

51:04.728 --> 51:05.695
Yeah.

51:05.696 --> 51:07.697
Let's go.

51:07.698 --> 51:09.032
Come on.

51:18.275 --> 51:18.575
Okay, so let's see who
we can get to drink the menses?

51:22.179 --> 51:24.781
Who the fuck
calls it menses?

51:24.782 --> 51:26.716
It's called...

51:26.717 --> 51:27.917
Oh, shit.

51:27.918 --> 51:29.719
There he is.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.288
I'm gonna teach this jizz-bucket
to tell people he fucked me.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.491
What?

51:36.527 --> 51:37.894
Hey, I got you this.

51:37.895 --> 51:39.128
What?

51:39.129 --> 51:40.330
I was playing beer pong
and I won

51:40.331 --> 51:41.798
and I wanted you
to drink it.

51:41.799 --> 51:43.600
I wasn't even in the game.

51:43.601 --> 51:46.769
I told you he'd be too chicken
shit just to drink one beer.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.237
Show you.

51:48.238 --> 51:50.106
Oh, oh-ho, this shot.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.281
Wet balls in the face.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.116
Yeah, well, you got
that for your stupid video.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.784
Oh, we did.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.519
It so worked.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.822
Oh, my God,
I just cut this girl's hair off.

52:18.802 --> 52:20.436
Nobody's phone?

52:52.970 --> 52:54.971
It's a pretty
crazy night, huh?

52:54.972 --> 52:57.173
Yeah, right.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.741
Um,
I should probably, like,

52:58.742 --> 53:01.044
go find Cherry
before she shoots somebody

53:01.045 --> 53:02.445
or something
crazy like that.

53:02.446 --> 53:05.081
I've known Cherry
a long time.

53:05.082 --> 53:06.749
She'll be okay.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.317
You know, I want
to tell you something.

53:11.422 --> 53:14.490
This is like
the coolest night of my life.

53:14.491 --> 53:16.526
No, you're actually
a pretty cool guy

53:16.527 --> 53:19.162
when you're not running around
trying impress everybody.

53:19.163 --> 53:21.964
Or make everybody
think you're a stud.

53:21.965 --> 53:23.399
Oh, my God.

53:23.400 --> 53:23.800
Come here,
you have to see this.
Okay.

53:25.469 --> 53:27.003
Phew!

53:39.917 --> 53:42.885
Phil, every single time
you don't pick up the phone

53:42.886 --> 53:45.655
that's another year that
you're waiting to have sex.

53:45.656 --> 53:47.557
Are you prepared
to wait that long?

53:47.558 --> 53:49.559
Because it's been
about 20 calls now.

53:49.560 --> 53:52.095
Better call me back,
sweet cheeks.

53:52.096 --> 53:53.563
Ugh!

53:57.334 --> 53:59.168
Please have sex with me.

53:59.169 --> 54:01.404
Um, have you seen us?

54:01.405 --> 54:04.073
Yeah, we wouldn't let you
videotape us making out.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.175
Okay, what about--
what about--

54:06.176 --> 54:07.877
Let me just see
one nipple.

54:07.878 --> 54:10.079
Can I suck your elbow
skin with my eyes closed?

54:10.080 --> 54:12.415
It'll feel the same.

54:12.416 --> 54:14.150
Okay,
can I feel your foot?

54:14.151 --> 54:15.752
Um, yeah, sure.

54:15.753 --> 54:16.886
Oh!

54:24.094 --> 54:25.628
Oh...

54:29.566 --> 54:32.101
Yo, anybody know
a bitch named Beth?

54:32.102 --> 54:33.636
Philip, what the fuck?

54:33.637 --> 54:35.238
Pick up your phone
right now.

54:35.239 --> 54:37.073
I'm so goddamn angry.

54:37.074 --> 54:38.007
Oh!

54:38.408 --> 54:41.210
Jamie.

54:44.248 --> 54:46.716
Don't forget
to pull out there, buddy.

54:56.760 --> 54:57.860
Yeah!

54:57.861 --> 54:59.395
Hey, look out!

55:02.766 --> 55:04.100
Jamie.

55:04.101 --> 55:05.735
Hello, Cheeba.

55:05.736 --> 55:07.236
Jamie.

55:08.705 --> 55:09.772
Cheeba.

55:09.773 --> 55:11.307
Jamie.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.242
Where's Mr. Tom?

55:13.243 --> 55:14.710
I'm right here, Cheeba.

55:14.711 --> 55:18.114
Look what I found
which is a fucking crossbow.

55:18.115 --> 55:19.248
Mr. Tom, oh, shit.

55:19.249 --> 55:21.350
Cal, my friend.

55:21.351 --> 55:22.351
Where's my wife?

55:22.352 --> 55:25.087
She's dead... tired.

55:25.088 --> 55:26.889
She's fine, man.

55:26.890 --> 55:28.391
She was talking about
how much she loves you.

55:28.392 --> 55:30.092
You guys are like
the best couple.

55:30.093 --> 55:31.327
You're a good man.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.628
How are you, Cheeba?

55:32.629 --> 55:34.330
I'm good, man.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.098
I see you still got
monkey boy.

55:36.099 --> 55:37.099
I do.

55:37.100 --> 55:38.334
Hi, Cheeba.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.669
You didn't
teach him English?

55:39.670 --> 55:41.437
Who has time
to teach English, right?

55:41.438 --> 55:42.705
You got my stuff?

55:42.706 --> 55:44.540
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You got my money?

55:44.541 --> 55:47.109
Yes. I'd like to see
the stuff first.

55:47.110 --> 55:48.177
Eh.

55:48.178 --> 55:49.378
I want to see the money.

55:51.915 --> 55:54.250
Where the fuck am I?

55:54.251 --> 55:55.718
Tom...

55:55.719 --> 55:57.253
Ah!

55:57.254 --> 56:00.556
I'm dead for a minute
and now I'm alive.

56:00.557 --> 56:03.693
Hey, Cheeba,
why you pointing a gun at Tom?

56:03.694 --> 56:05.094
No, bad boy.

56:05.095 --> 56:06.128
Cherry, back off.

56:06.129 --> 56:07.330
I will fucking kill you.

56:07.331 --> 56:08.397
Yeah, Mr. Cheeba.

56:08.398 --> 56:09.866
Mr. Tom is my friend.

56:09.867 --> 56:11.100
Put it down or else...

56:11.101 --> 56:12.335
Or else what?

56:12.336 --> 56:13.469
Shoot me
with a bow and arrow?

56:13.470 --> 56:15.338
It's a compound crossbow.

56:15.339 --> 56:16.672
I got this, Cal.

56:16.673 --> 56:18.507
No, just put down
the crossbow, Cal,

56:18.508 --> 56:21.110
the arrow's just gonna
piss him off even more.

56:21.111 --> 56:23.512
Drop that gun, Cheeba.

56:23.513 --> 56:25.448
Yeah, Miss Cal's one of us.

56:25.449 --> 56:27.917
He's gay?
I almost had sex with him.

56:27.918 --> 56:31.354
Cal is gay?
All right, back up,
everybody, right now!

56:31.355 --> 56:33.122
Put it down, Cheeba!

56:33.123 --> 56:34.257
I'm in love with her.

56:34.258 --> 56:35.725
You're in love with me?

56:35.726 --> 56:38.261
Oh, my God, that is
so fucking sweet, baby.

56:38.262 --> 56:39.262
He's bisexual?

56:39.263 --> 56:40.763
Shut up! Shut up!

56:40.764 --> 56:42.231
Shut up! Shut up!

56:42.232 --> 56:43.633
Put it down
or I will shot you.

56:43.634 --> 56:46.102
I'll shit rape
your body, dude.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.103
On the count of three.

56:47.104 --> 56:48.738
Ooh, shit rape.

56:48.739 --> 56:50.239
One!
I got this, Cal.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.576
I got this.

56:53.577 --> 56:54.677
Two.

56:54.678 --> 56:56.913
No, no, no, nobody
shit raping anybody.

56:56.914 --> 56:58.447
Three.

57:02.219 --> 57:03.319
Come on.

57:03.320 --> 57:04.453
Come on, are we good?

57:04.454 --> 57:06.322
Are you kidding me?

57:06.323 --> 57:07.690
Shit rape, really?

57:07.691 --> 57:10.226
I know. What the fuck--
Get over here.

57:10.227 --> 57:10.693
Oh, God.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.297
I'm glad
you didn't shoot me.

57:15.599 --> 57:18.234
I know.
Me too, right?

57:18.235 --> 57:19.402
And fucking Dean.

57:19.403 --> 57:20.803
Hey, bro.

57:20.804 --> 57:22.271
I left you
at the Statue of Liberty, man.

57:22.272 --> 57:23.439
How did you get down here?

57:23.440 --> 57:24.807
I used a balloon.

57:24.808 --> 57:26.776
Did you?
I fucking love you,
bitch.

57:26.777 --> 57:27.843
Fucking love you too,
bitch.

57:28.712 --> 57:31.247
Hey, are we good?

57:33.283 --> 57:34.617
Yeah, we're good.

57:34.618 --> 57:36.953
This,
it's filled with appletini.

57:36.954 --> 57:38.487
Hey, you guys,
who here wants to be my fan?

57:47.030 --> 57:48.965
You want to go
make out sometime?
Sure.

57:54.237 --> 57:56.372
Then Cal,
you tried to kiss me

57:56.373 --> 57:58.708
and then you passed out.

57:58.709 --> 58:01.243
So I made sure
you weren't bleeding

58:01.244 --> 58:02.712
and then I went home.

58:02.713 --> 58:05.247
I can't believe it.
I'm just so embarrassed.

58:07.250 --> 58:08.517
Oh.

58:08.518 --> 58:10.319
This shit is wrong.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.254
You made me drink
your period.

58:12.255 --> 58:14.523
Scribble dibble.

58:14.524 --> 58:16.225
No, not scribble dibble, man.

58:16.226 --> 58:17.293
What the fuck
is scribble dibble?

58:17.294 --> 58:19.228
Did anyone see my dog?

58:19.229 --> 58:21.998
Oh, no, bro.

58:21.999 --> 58:22.498
It's weird.

58:23.567 --> 58:26.135
And then
I went home to google,

58:27.704 --> 58:29.739
to see if there was a way
that you could live

58:29.740 --> 58:32.708
with an arrow in your shoulder
or if we had to put you down.

58:32.709 --> 58:35.478
Well, what did you
find out, doctor?

58:35.479 --> 58:36.712
Well, I found out
that all I have to do

58:40.484 --> 58:43.152
is take it nice
and hard and rip it out.

58:43.153 --> 58:44.720
Ow!

58:44.721 --> 58:47.189
Oh, God.
That smarts.

58:47.190 --> 58:50.760
That was like some
American Indian type shit.
Oh...

58:50.761 --> 58:52.795
That was like
one with the earth, like...

58:52.796 --> 58:55.564
You fucking made me
drink your menses.

58:55.565 --> 58:57.700
Seriously, what is
with the all this menses talk?

58:57.701 --> 59:01.437
Is this like a 1950s
paper doll sex ed class?

59:01.438 --> 59:04.006
And, honestly, Beef,
you deserve it.

59:04.007 --> 59:05.541
That's what you get
for telling everybody

59:05.542 --> 59:07.176
that we fucked.

59:07.177 --> 59:08.844
Okay, so somebody
Scooby-doo me.

59:10.781 --> 59:13.382
Who the hell
fricking juiced us?

59:13.383 --> 59:14.884
It was Cherry.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.952
She said she doesn't
like to be baby-sat.

59:16.953 --> 59:19.188
Listen, guys, we're getting off
point here, all right.

59:19.189 --> 59:22.391
We've figured out everything
except for whether or not

59:22.392 --> 59:23.926
I slept with Polly.

59:23.927 --> 59:26.929
So what-- what are you--
what are you worried about?

59:26.930 --> 59:29.932
I don't know how to find out
whether or not

59:29.933 --> 59:31.767
I actually slept
with her, okay.

59:31.768 --> 59:34.403
And I need to figure it out
before my girlfriend,

59:34.404 --> 59:35.771
soon-to-be fiancé
gets here.

59:35.772 --> 59:38.641
You couldn't--
Why don't you just ask her?

59:38.642 --> 59:41.544
Uh, uh, I don't know.

59:41.545 --> 59:43.479
That's weird.
You can't just
do that, Bob.

59:43.480 --> 59:44.680
You want me to ask her?

59:44.681 --> 59:46.682
No, no, no,
thank you, man.

59:46.683 --> 59:48.084
All right, I respect you.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.185
Yeah. Yeah.

59:49.953 --> 59:52.388
Polly?

59:53.657 --> 59:55.124
- What are you doing?
- Yeah?

59:55.125 --> 59:56.625
No, no, no.

59:56.626 --> 59:57.793
Can you come in here?

59:57.794 --> 59:59.929
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:06.402
Hey...

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.704
everybody.

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:09.105
What is this, some kind
of extended after party?

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:14.643
Phil here...

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:17.646
partied hard last night
and he's wondering

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:18.280
if he partied hard
inside of you.

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:22.818
Phil?

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.887
Polly, I'm sorry, okay.

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:28.090
I just-- I wanted to know
what happened.

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:31.660
Well, first off,

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:34.730
Bob,
your dog Molly is dead.

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:35.064
I'm really sorry.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.400
Oh, thank God.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.036
Oh, thank God.

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:43.973
I got to tell you, I mean,
she had cancer really bad.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.742
Cancer of her ovaries.
Oh.

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:49.178
I didn't even know
dog had ovaries.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:50.546
Me neither.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:53.749
So I'm glad
she went peacefully.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.886
Well,
here's what happened.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:59.421
We were all standing
around the beer pong table

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.823
in the living room

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:03.893
and my ex Dave
just showed up...

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.665
Whoa!

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.667
Why, why would you
mess with a girl?

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:15.571
Polly.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:18.407
Polly, you broke my heart.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:19.675
We need to talk.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.177
Back off, Clown.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:22.478
They're with me.

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:24.580
This is between me and her.

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:24.880
Oh, yeah?

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.417
Is everyone okay up there?

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:32.087
Yeah,
but you shot a dog.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.422
Oh, my God.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:34.890
I love dogs.

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:40.062
Oh, fuck.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:47.570
Bro, dude, you really whacked
the shit out of that guy.

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.505
Oh, dude,
I didn't mean to.

01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:51.440
Can you do me
a favor, man?

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.841
Take him back to the dorm

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.743
and make sure
he finds his pants.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.512
Yeah, absolutely.
Hey, Glenn.

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:58.047
Yeah.

01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:04.653
He smells amazing,
doesn't he?

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:06.288
Yeah, his face
smells like crayons.

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:07.656
You okay, bro?

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.659
Yeah, I'm okay,
Hensen, thanks.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.428
Hey, could you
do me a favor, man,

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:14.897
and make sure they actually
get him back to the dorms?

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:15.130
By the way, I want
to introduce you to Rachel.

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:19.501
She is my--

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:21.203
I'm his new girlfriend.

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:22.438
Oh.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.440
She's a contortionist.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:25.908
I'm a contortionist.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.509
You want to see me
do the puzzle?

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.578
I do.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.447
I do, I do.

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:33.449
Oh, are you okay?

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.452
Oh, I just feel--

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:37.686
I feel a little, oh.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:40.689
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.524
Okay, come with me.

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:44.193
I'm gonna
take care of you, okay?

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:45.828
Thanks.

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:47.663
Why is it going straight
to voicemail, Phil?

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:49.431
Call me back now.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.600
Look, Dave is an okay guy.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.603
He's just a little confused.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.104
Yeah.
I think we all are.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.674
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.186
I'm so--

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:12.454
I'm sorry.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.256
No. It's okay.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:17.693
It's just, you know,
I thought you got a girlfriend.

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:20.429
Oh God, Beth.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.231
I'm just--

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:24.967
I proposed to her
and she's coming here tomorrow.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:30.839
So why aren't you sure?

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.541
It seems like
it's the only thing

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.743
that's really gonna
make her happy.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:37.446
Does it make you happy?

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:39.915
I don't think it does.

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.350
You know, you should
never settle in your life, Phil.

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:48.023
Oh, God.

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:49.325
Look, if you ever want
to talk about anything,

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.596
you know--

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.031
Oh!

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.066
Oh.

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:58.500
Oh.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.069
Oh.

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:05.607
You done?

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:06.108
I think so.

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:15.451
Oh God, I'm devastated.

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:16.752
Oh, God.

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:19.455
Why, because you farted
in front of me?

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:19.822
Hey, look, look, ready?

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:26.061
See?

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:29.465
I did it, too,
it's no biggie.

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:30.933
Oh, okay, mister.

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:32.868
It's time to get you
cleaned up and into bed.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.270
Oh, you are not
in good shape.

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:36.605
Okay.

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.474
Up, up, up.

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:41.009
All right.
Oh, God.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.519
Bro.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.921
Come on.

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.857
Okay, yep.
Oh, God.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:57.526
All right.
All right.

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:58.827
Oh. Phil.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.462
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
You know what?

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.598
Why don't we just do it
under the covers instead?

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:04.166
Okay.
Okay.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:13.475
Thank you.

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.043
Kind of gross.
Okay.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:15.411
Um, listen, I'm gonna be
right back, just stay here.

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:21.016
Okay?
All right.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:23.719
Philip, you're supposed
to be worshiping me.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.587
I'm supposed
to be your god.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.256
The only
above me is Jesus.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:30.993
You need to call your
future wife back right now.

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:32.060
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:35.230
Hey.

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:37.466
Hey.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:38.767
I've got a shirt, pants

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.569
and underwear
with vomit on them.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.471
You want to help me out?

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:43.472
You're gonna wash them?

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.007
Yeah.

01:05:45.008 --> 01:05:46.708
I don't know
where the laundry room is.

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.478
You're in it.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:51.480
Oh, fuck.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:52.881
I thought
that was a robot.

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:54.483
Doesn't it look like
a robot?

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:55.717
A little bit.

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:57.352
All right.
Well, cool.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.221
I'm about to do
a load of pukey pants myself.

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:01.290
Thank you.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:05.961
Now if you don't mind,
I'm gonna go to Jupiter.

01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:11.967
Oh, what the fuck, man.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.035
It's like fucking
skunk shit.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:17.840
All right, look,
I'll see you later.

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:22.644
Oh, I don't know why
that's funny.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:23.011
What the fuck
is this, man?

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.951
This is fucking crack.

01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:30.185
Fuck! I'm gonna be
fucking paranoid.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.489
Hi.
Hi.

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:37.359
Listen, your clothes
are in the wash, all right?

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.927
They'll be ready
in the morning.

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:41.997
Thank you.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.232
What are you doing?

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:44.967
I'm gonna lay down
next to you,

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:46.235
so you don't choke
on your own vomit

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:48.570
in the middle
of the night.

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.372
Why are you...

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:52.307
You think I'm gonna let you blow
chunks on my clothes, too?

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:55.744
But, listen,
no funny business.

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.145
If you try anything,

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:59.348
I'm going to punch you
square in the nuts

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.550
and then I'm not gonna be
your friend anymore.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:03.752
Okay?

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:04.987
Can you move?

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.224
Okay.

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:15.130
Hey, could you
turn off the light?

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:28.143
That's pretty much
what happened.

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.012
See, dude, I told you.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:31.513
I knew I did not have sex.

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:34.349
Okay, you don't have to sound
so excited about it.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.018
Well, he was
just concerned

01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:37.553
that he'd get
a case of the crotch rot

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.687
because, you know.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:40.155
Because of what?

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:42.791
Oh, you know
what the kids call it today,

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:45.460
you know, a trollop.

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:47.029
You know, a hussy.

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:48.797
You're a slut.

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.832
You know,
all the guys on this campus

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:54.102
just love to talk about
how much sex you've all had.

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:57.472
Guilty, guilty for sure.
Indeed.

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.041
Wait, so, Polly,
do you mean that...

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.478
No.

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:05.514
Not that it's any of
your goddamn business,

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:06.682
but no I haven't had sex
with anyone on this campus.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.652
A couple of years ago,
I went off to a band camp

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:17.024
and this guy there
liked me,

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.895
but this girl liked him.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:20.629
So she started a rumor saying
that I was a big old slut.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:24.700
Polly is the cleanest chick
on campus,

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:30.339
spick and span.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.441
You can eat off
her vagina.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:33.809
Thank you, Bob.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:36.511
Polly, I'm sorry.

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:37.779
Um...

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.048
listen, I--

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.517
Oh, I'll get it.
I'll get it.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:45.621
I need to ask you if,
I don't know,

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.622
maybe we can start over.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:49.323
Oh-ew!

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:50.359
Oh.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.794
I've been looking
all over for you.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.162
Beth. You?

01:08:54.162 --> 01:08:56.765
You?
Polly fucking Wallace.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:09:00.035
Bitch-breath
backdoor Beth.

01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:02.104
Oh, wait a second.
You two know each other?

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.572
I cannot believe, Phil,

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:05.841
that your girlfriend
is backdoor Beth.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.343
Phil, she just doesn't want us
to be here, let's go.

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:11.513
This is the bitch
from band camp.

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:15.050
We all called her
backdoor Beth.

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:16.385
You want to know why?

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:18.053
Why?

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:21.456
She didn't even wait
for orientation to end

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:25.160
before her backend
was open for business.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.761
No,
I said in my butt only.

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:30.032
What's up?

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:33.835
Oh, yeah, keep going.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:36.337
Oh, it's my first time
in the butt with a black guy.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.140
It's great.
Excuse me, hold on.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.042
Do you need something?

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.609
Hurry up, bro.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:43.111
Polly, what the fuck.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:44.513
You never knock,
you dumb bitch.

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:49.184
Your friend gonna join us?

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.053
No.
Get the fuck out.

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:53.255
What's wrong with you?
I said leave.

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:55.090
So were you like
born with a penis?

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:57.059
No, it's just
a really big clit.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.794
You get the fuck out!

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:01.129
Was crazy.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.596
That summer she had
more dongs in her ass

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:06.768
than a Chinese phonebook.

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.470
Oh.

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:10.038
Oh, damn.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.207
It was just one summer

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.277
and technically
I'm still a virgin.

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:15.644
I mean, I saved my front end
engines just for you.

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.148
I call foul there.

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:21.283
Shut up, Cal!

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:22.951
Nobody asked you.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:23.285
Beth, we were together
when you left for band camp.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.124
Let's, um,
let's just get out of here

01:10:29.125 --> 01:10:31.860
and go talk about of it,
shall we?

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:32.861
I don't care how many guys
you've had in your butt.

01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:37.232
You don't?

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:38.500
You don't?

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:38.767
He may not,
but Jesus does, Beth.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:42.070
No, I don't,

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:44.573
because I've realized
something.

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.043
I know what I want now.

01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:53.048
And it's not you.

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:54.316
What?

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:56.418
If I were to stay
with you,

01:10:56.419 --> 01:11:00.055
then I'd just be settling

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:02.057
and I don't want to settle.

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:03.291
But, Phil...

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.826
No, Beth,
I'm sorry but no.

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:08.530
But look,
no hard feelings, okay?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:13.368
Let's try
and stay friends, okay?

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:17.072
And actually I know
how much you love sweets,

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:17.339
so I got you
some special chocolates.

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:24.212
Do you have those special
chocolates I got for Beth?

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.380
Yeah, yeah,
they're right here.

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:29.217
You know how much
you like sweets, babe.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.322
And I had
these special chocolates
imported just for you.

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:37.058
So why don't you
just head back home

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.060
and we'll just talk
when we talk.

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.061
Okay?

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:41.696
Um, well...

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.298
Wow,
these are great, thanks.

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:45.767
And this will--
this will all blow over.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:51.673
And I'll pray for us.
Okay?

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:54.843
Bye.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.513
Good-bye, Beth.

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:00.849
Peace be with you, Beth.
Enjoy the wafers.

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:02.517
Bye, Beth.

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:02.651
Oh, dude, that was
so instant revenge. Oh, my God.

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:10.158
She better not get ass
cancer from those candies, bro.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.594
Dude, no.
It was petty, it was mean,

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:14.529
it was stupid and it felt
really fucking good.
Yes!

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:18.466
I mean this doesn't
answer about Phil's nuts.

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:22.637
What about them?

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.873
Well, I mean, if he didn't
the hoochie coochie from you

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:27.175
then why has he been scratching
like there's no tomorrow?

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.845
Last night
after we went to bed,

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:31.446
we heard gunshots

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:33.548
and then Mr. Tom and Cherry
came running up

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.650
into the room
and you told Mr. Tom

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:37.519
that you guys
were BFF for life

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.388
and started talking
to him about baseball.

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:42.257
And then he asked you

01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:44.092
if you wanted
a baseball tattoo on your pubes

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.094
and you were like,
"Fuck, yeah."

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.864
So you have a new tattoo.

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:56.238
It's actually
pretty fucking cool.

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:59.140
Well, this is getting
a little weird.

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:00.609
Come on, Georgia.

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:02.210
Meester, let's go talk
about our friendship.

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.912
I've never
had a gay friend before.

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:06.314
Yeah, yeah, I don't know
if you've official met Georgia.

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:08.083
She's my...

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:09.084
I'm his girlfriend.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:10.418
Girlfriend.

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:10.552
Oh, nice Adam's apple.

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:16.157
All right, ass clowns,
I'm out of here.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.492
Jamie, wait.

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:20.262
I just want to talk to you
for a second.

01:13:20.263 --> 01:13:21.529
I feel like a douche

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.565
because last night
in the party

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:23.765
I told everybody
that I loved you.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:28.637
And I know now

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:32.240
that what I should've done
is taken you aside like this

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.342
and told you that
you're the first girl

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:36.344
I've ever really liked.

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:38.013
And ever since
I first saw you,

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:40.248
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:43.485
And I know

01:13:43.486 --> 01:13:45.086
that you would never feel
that way about some--

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:48.223
about somebody like me.

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:50.325
Well, first of all,

01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:52.427
don't tell me how I feel.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:55.096
And second, why don't you
take me out to breakfast

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.866
so we can talk about it?

01:13:57.867 --> 01:13:59.534
Yes.

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.776
Thank you again for taking
such good care of me last night.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:13.248
Hey, it's okay.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:15.317
I actually kind of liked it.

01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:16.584
I really took to heart

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:19.087
what you said
about not settling.

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.556
I don't want to settle.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:22.624
I want to find someone
who loves me for me,

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:28.430
someone who respects me,

01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:30.899
someone--
someone who doesn't

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.834
tell me what to do,
asks me what to do.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:36.171
We all do, Phil.

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:55.123
Oh, oh.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.925
Wow.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.626
I think that might have been the
greatest kiss of my entire life.

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.164
Me too.

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.265
Oh.
There you go, man.

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:05.500
Coffee and duds.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.102
Perfect.
That's my finger.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:08.103
All right.
Sorry.

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:09.637
I need it.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:10.071
Well, well, Phil, now
that we've kissed,

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:16.111
I think it's time
for you to meet my dad.

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:17.445
Oh, whoa.

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:19.781
Let's slow down
there right, man?

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:21.349
Phil,

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.850
I would like you
to meet my father, Bob.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.521
Hey, little guy.

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:44.339
<i>Her nickname
 is fucking.</i>

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.874
<i>Polly fucking Wallace, bro.</i>

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.675
<i>As in mother
 fucking Bob.</i>

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:49.077
<i>His name's
 probably not Mr. Tom.</i>

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:50.412
<i>It's probably Keyser Soze.</i>

01:15:50.413 --> 01:15:51.880
<i>It's just a college party.</i>

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.882
<i>MF Bob, just--
 it's like a campus legend.</i>

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:56.317
<i>Let me be the first
 then to officially welcome</i>

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.652
<i>you to the campus.</i>

01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:59.487
You want some bacon?

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:02.824
<i>Polly, I'm talking
 about a campus legend.</i>

01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:05.493
<i>Oh, I'm going
 to MF Bob's house tonight.</i>

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:07.162
I love bacon.

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:10.331
Bob?

01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:14.335
Bob is your dad?

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:17.338
And this is your house?
Yes.

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:19.507
Oh, God.

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:20.175
I'm sorry about
your mug, sir.

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:24.579
We are family.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.081
He's a good one, daddy.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:27.415
Oh, I see that, babe.

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.493
Hey, Bob.

01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:40.128
Uh...

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:42.964
Cherry has something
she wants to say to you, man.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:43.098
Hey, I'm really sorry
I shot your dog.

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:47.735
I got this little guy
from the shelter this morning.

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:53.341
He's so cute.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:54.342
I know.

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:56.144
I'm so sorry.

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:58.346
I love dogs so much.

01:16:58.347 --> 01:16:59.514
It's all right.

01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:00.949
I know you killed my dog,

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.785
but she was going to be
put down today anyway.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:05.787
I wasn't going to shoot her.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.655
I would've had her put down
professionally with a needle.

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:10.358
But, hey,
you saved me in the trouble.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.493
Really?
Yeah.

01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:12.794
So what now?

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.462
What do we do now,
is we just see

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.364
if this little puppy
likes bacon.

01:17:19.602 --> 01:17:21.836
Who doesn't like bacon?

Wait, no, no.
Tell me, what is it?

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:33.374
Well, there's
something in here.

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.178
Oh, my God,
this is Meester's camera.

01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:42.350
No, it isn't.
Yes.

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:43.618
Oh, my God, put it on.

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:44.986

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:50.458
<i>Oh.</i>

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:50.725
Oh, my God.

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.596
So Georgia, you just
cut the aorta right here

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:57.832
and there his heart.

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.604
Yeah!

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:04.339
You see it.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.974
I'm kidding, I'm not actually
gonna eat your heart.

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:07.508
I'll put it back.
I'll put it back.

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:08.843
Don't you worry.

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:21.256
<i>Oh!</i>

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:23.891
<i>I just made another mistake,
 I'm really sorry.</i>

01:19:24.727 --> 01:19:27.362
<i>You see, I told you</i>

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.966
<i>if you drain it fast,
 you will pack up.</i>

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.469
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:35.837
<i>Cheers, boys.</i>

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:44.379
<i>Now do yours.</i>

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.413
<i>Georgia!</i>

01:19:45.414 --> 01:19:46.848
<i>Georgia!</i>

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:53.087
<i>Come here.
Dog is so cute.</i>

01:19:57.926 --> 01:19:59.160
<i>Is everyone okay up there?</i>

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:02.363
<i>Hey.</i>

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:06.367
Is that Kevin Smith?

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.370
<i>Got me.
 I don't know.</i>

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:10.371
<i>Good party though.</i>

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:11.906
<i>Great party.</i>

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:13.675
<i>You know the problem is,
 Bob's gonna be pissed,</i>

01:20:13.676 --> 01:20:15.443
<i>because Cherry messed up
his whole house.</i>

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:19.914
<i>Really?
 Yeah.</i>

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:21.382
<i>Are you serious?
 Yeah.</i>

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:22.517
<i>Let's get on.</i>

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:25.119
<i>Hey, are you filming us?</i>

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.788
Oh. Yeah.

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:28.289
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.395
Now!

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:35.463
Now!

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:40.601
Hey, give me the money.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.036
Give me the money.

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:43.705
Give me the money.

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:47.241
Give me the money.
Give me the money.
Oh!

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:50.545
All right, do it, do it,
do it, do it, do it, do it.

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:52.480
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:58.686
Oh, my God.

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:04.325
Phil here
partied hard last night.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:10.365
You know how we all party.

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.500
He partied hard.

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:13.768
And he's wondering

01:21:13.769 --> 01:21:18.573
if he partied
hard inside of you.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.412
God, I mean,
am I ever gonna figure out

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:25.079
how I got this freaking
wooden arrow in my neck?

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.551
Wait, wait, wait.

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:33.688
Well, how do I know?

01:21:33.689 --> 01:21:36.691
Like when they stand up
they look like the letter ten--

01:21:36.692 --> 01:21:38.493
Well, letter ten.

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:39.861
- Number ten.
- Quiet.

01:21:39.862 --> 01:21:40.294
Now what the fuck
is the noise about?

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:43.498
Oh!

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.902
Goddamn it,
why is there noise?

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:49.504
I'm not really that bad.

01:21:49.505 --> 01:21:51.506
That's a baby pig,

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:52.807
Oh. Oh.

01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:54.642
That makes me sad.

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.811
No, man, because,

01:21:56.812 --> 01:22:00.181
it's like a little pig and--

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:02.483
Take two.

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:04.018
He's making me laugh.

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:05.420
I thought you were
at the Britney Spear's concert.

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:09.357
How the fuck
did you get out of there?

01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:10.958
I was supposed to take her
to the vet this morning

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:14.695
to put her down.

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:14.929
Now you don't have to.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.967
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:23.704
I was about--
I guess it saved me the trip.

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:24.338
She had--
she had sickle cell anemia.

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:28.810
Ooh.

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:30.077
Yeah, it's weird.
That's rough.

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:32.213
She was a black lab.

01:22:32.214 --> 01:22:33.181
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Mexican Jonah Hill

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:36.784
and the guy
that looks like the dude

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.586
from the eating
out movies.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.858
Okay.

01:22:43.859 --> 01:22:45.059
Oh!

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:45.960
Phil, Carl,
what's up, bros?

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:49.564
Cal--
How you doing, bro?

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.769
Dude, I left you 50 foot
under by that sunken treasure.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:58.105
How the fuck did you get up
without another tank of oxygen?

01:22:58.106 --> 01:22:59.941
Dude, I can hold
my breath forever.

01:22:59.942 --> 01:23:01.375
No, shit.
Oh, yeah.

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:04.111
Let me practice
that right now, goddamn it.

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:06.013
I've just woke up--

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.783
Just say you want to know
who you fucked.

01:23:08.784 --> 01:23:10.785
Get it out.

01:23:10.786 --> 01:23:12.787
He totally put his pig
in your blanket.

01:23:12.788 --> 01:23:14.255
That's enough.
Polly?

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:16.624
Why don't you just ask me?

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:19.026
I would.

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.394
I should cut.

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:22.029
I will cut next time,
that's your job.

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:23.831
I apologize.
I'll go all the way through.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.233
I'll go all the way through.
I'm so sorry, Dante, I love you.

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:26.000
It's okay.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.401
Fuck, man.

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:29.070
I thought you were
doing America's race.

01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:30.872
You're in the
fucking catamaran.

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:32.273
I thought
you were in Tahiti.

01:23:32.274 --> 01:23:36.077
Well, hold on. You think
it was anal or vaginal?

01:23:36.078 --> 01:23:38.312
Excuse me?
It's definitely
anal with this guy.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.347
Hey.

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:41.048
Last time I saw you,

01:23:42.818 --> 01:23:45.219
you were giving
Miley Cyrus a buzz cut.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.189
So were you like
born with a penis?

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.590
You get the fuck out!

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:52.793
Fuck.

01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:58.199
25 fucking years, I still
burn my fucking thumb.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.800
You're gonna--
you're gonna get.

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:01.969
This is why I like fruit.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:04.138
I hate this shit.

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:07.208
Bitch, take
your lunch break.

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:10.478
Chop, chop, let's go.

01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:12.547
What's up, man?

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:13.814
How you guys been?

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:15.116
What's up, Hensen?

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:16.817
Fuck off, Hensen,

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:18.119
and my name's Cal
for Christ's sake.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.954
Get the fuck out of here.

01:24:19.955 --> 01:24:22.189
Was her tail,
still connected when she died?

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:25.960
Because there's people
that steal tail,

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:28.396
they're called tail thieves,
off a dead dog carcass.

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.200
Last time I saw you,

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:34.969
you were on top
of the Arc d'Triumph,

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:36.637
How the fuck did you get--

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:38.172
Is that, I'm sorry,

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.540
was that a fuck one
or a regular one?

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:40.808
You can say fuck.

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.977
You kill me every time.

01:24:42.978 --> 01:24:44.045
Step in, step out.

01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:45.313
I don't want to talk to you.

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:46.981
Well, I'm sure
you don't, but--

01:24:46.982 --> 01:24:48.416
I don't want to talk
to no dog killer.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.619
I know I killed your dog
but I feel really bad

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.221
and that's why I got this dog
from the shelter this morning.

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:56.057
It's like a peace offering.

01:24:56.058 --> 01:24:57.892
It's not even
the same kind of dog.

01:24:57.893 --> 01:24:59.360
Look how cute it is. Don't you
want to hold it for a second?

01:24:59.361 --> 01:25:02.630
Yeah, but you made
my dog Alpo.

01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:05.299
But I feel bad, that's why
I'm bringing you this one.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.435
Maybe we should take
this one and kill it.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.469
See how you feel.

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:09.904
Whatever you want to do,
I don't care.

01:25:09.905 --> 01:25:10.905
I'm just trying
to be nice.

01:25:10.906 --> 01:25:12.006
You disgust us.

01:25:12.007 --> 01:25:13.140
What?
Let's go.

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:14.342
You know what,
fuck them, let's go.

01:25:14.343 --> 01:25:15.843
You know what,
fuck you people.

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:16.844
Fuck you.
Fuck off.

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:18.145
The dog looks like you.

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.414
These mother fuckers.

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:20.615
And Daniel here
is wondering--

01:25:23.819 --> 01:25:25.286
Phil.

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.057
Phil.

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:31.158
Here we go again.

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:33.227
Ten baby rabbits.

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:35.129
Whole family
is dying in a fire.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.597
That's hilarious.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.066
Now it's gonna
make me laugh.

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:40.534
That's good.
Oh.
