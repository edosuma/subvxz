Oh, no...

Love how my first case as

is to have a relationship
with you.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.052
(scoffs)

05:44.969 --> 05:46.346
Why?

05:46.387 --> 05:47.555

05:47.597 --> 05:49.140
Don't believe it.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.808
Oh, come on.
I'd take a bullet for you.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.519
Really?
You would take a bullet...

05:53.561 --> 05:54.771
Okay, maybe not a bullet,
because, like,

05:54.812 --> 05:56.064
I have a crippling fear
of dying.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.148
I wouldn't take a bullet
for anyone,

05:57.190 --> 05:58.566
like, not even a baby.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.777
Wow. Such a cool person you are.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.528
The point is, I love you,
and if there was a way for me

06:02.570 --> 06:05.740
to prove it to you,
I would, but...

06:05.782 --> 06:07.742
Oh, there is.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.369
Okay.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.120

until we figure
out where Jess is.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.962

06:21.923 --> 06:24.300

Cool-- Th-Thank you.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.660
But clean up after yourselves.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.746
I refuse to be
your housekeeper as well.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.081

07:00.086 --> 07:02.463
No, I'm good.
I don't really like coffee.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.173
Oh, I-I know.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.427
I, uh, put pop in yours.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.557
Thanks.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.851
Yeah.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.729
Where's Trey?
This is, this is his.

07:18.771 --> 07:22.692
He's looking for his phone again

07:34.787 --> 07:36.664
Keith was so lazy,
these are all the cases

07:36.706 --> 07:39.083
I inherited that
he hadn't even assigned.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.335
Two days ago to two years ago.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.546
Wow. Eh, this is why people
hate the police.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.299
I mean, I could think of
a couple other reasons, but...

07:47.216 --> 07:49.177
Oh. Exactly what I wanted.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.636
More files.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.929
I'm not too sure
if it'll even help.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.347
It's mostly just bank records.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.892
Oh, hey, uh, before I forget.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.518
Here you go, man.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.354
You are officially a forensic
accounting specialist

08:00.396 --> 08:02.273
for Chicago PD, district 23.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.233
I don't get a badge?

08:04.275 --> 08:05.359
Yeah, that's a badge.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.403
This is a laminated ID card.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.738
Sarah!

08:08.779 --> 08:11.282
Hey, or I guess
I should call you, uh,

08:11.324 --> 08:13.493
Detective Barnes now, right?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.411
Uh, what you got?
Uh, not much.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.163
That phone that we found
at Josiah's

08:17.205 --> 08:19.332
is registered to Trey Williams,
but we can't find him.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.250
His neighbors haven't seen him
in a couple of days.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.752
Hey, why don't you put
a couple guys over there

08:22.793 --> 08:24.086
to stake his apartment out?
I already did.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.922
But what about his call log?
Texts?

08:25.963 --> 08:27.590
Nothing that suggests
his whereabouts.

08:27.632 --> 08:28.758
The last number that called
him was from a burner.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.384
Oh. Where did it ping?

08:30.426 --> 08:31.844
It's, uh,
off the grid.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.096
Only 12 residences
in the area.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.973
Patricia Rosen, Gary
Norton, Lesley Bell,

08:36.015 --> 08:38.976
Nancy Hoffer...
Wait, Lesley Bell?

08:39.018 --> 08:41.020
Yeah. Why?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.690
I wonder if she's related
to Felix Bell.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.442
You still don't
have an address?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.069
Murphy, I'm trying.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.862
Hey.
You were out
there forever.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.323
Did you find your phone?
No.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.824
I might have left it at Beau's.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.368
That's the last place
I remember using it.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.786
I'm gonna go
check there.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.497
Okay. Hang on.
I'll, um, walk you out.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.751
(whispers):
Hi.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.130
Thanks again for helping.

09:08.172 --> 09:11.300
I didn't really do much
besides steal your phone,

09:11.342 --> 09:13.719
keep everybody up all
night looking for it.

09:13.761 --> 09:14.971
(laughs softly)

09:15.012 --> 09:16.931
Yeah.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.266
Hey.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.977
Come here.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.440
I'll call you. You know,
when I've found my phone.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.985
You better.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.528
Maybe when this
whole thing is over,

09:30.570 --> 09:34.824
I could try to live a
regular, boring life.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.784
Take you out for brunch.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.370
Or something?
Whatever.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.122
Like normal people?

09:41.163 --> 09:46.335
I don't really think
either of us can do "normal."

09:46.377 --> 09:51.340
Yeah, but...
we could try, right?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.302
Sure.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.096
Sure.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.724
I'll see you later,
shorty. Okay.
Bye.

10:03.811 --> 10:07.023
Felix.
Wait, wait, wait.
I-I think I got it.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.608
Seriously?
Yeah. Redford Long.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.818
This is the same Redford Long.
Allwood Avenue.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.278
Let's go.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.280
Okay.
Come on, Pretzel.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.533
Gonna get dressed.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.201
"Good job, Felix.
Thanks for doing that."

10:19.243 --> 10:21.704
I can't believe you're gonna
let them all stay here,

10:21.746 --> 10:24.123
like... like, indefinitely?

10:24.165 --> 10:26.125
What choice did I have?

10:26.167 --> 10:28.753
(groans)
God...

10:28.794 --> 10:31.130
You'll be fine living with
Murphy for a little bit.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.174
I don't want to!

10:33.215 --> 10:34.884
(muffled grunt)

10:34.925 --> 10:36.302
You want to go
grab some food?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.429
Yes! Yes, I do.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.640
I kind of want a cheeseburger.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.851
Oh, I don't know.
Feeling kind of like tacos.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.479
(pounding on door)
GENE:
Chicago PD! Open up!

10:52.026 --> 10:53.527
How did they find us?
We're dead, it's over.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.655
Hang on. Just go
in the other room, all of you.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.657
I'll handle it.
Hey, hey... Les--

10:57.698 --> 10:59.950
Go, just go, go.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.495
Pretzel, come.
(exhales)

11:05.539 --> 11:08.668
Chief Gene Clemens,
Chicago PD.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.003
Hi. Lesley Bell.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.797
How can I help you?
Yeah. We know who you are.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.256
Felix's sister.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.175
Uh, we're looking
for your brother

11:16.217 --> 11:17.718
and his friends
and we have reason

11:17.760 --> 11:19.178
to believe that
they were here.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.222
Oh, yeah, of course
this is about Felix.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.848
Yeah, he was here.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.226
Uh, he showed up and said
he was in some trouble

11:25.267 --> 11:27.269
and that he needed
a place to crash.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.230
But I said no,
I didn't want any part of it.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.107
Uh, when was that?
Yesterday.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.858
Was he with anyone?

11:32.900 --> 11:35.486
He was with some friends and
then they all split to Canada.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.446
He wanted to tell me more,
but I stopped him.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.407
I'm not about to be disbarred

11:39.448 --> 11:41.742
because of my brother's
stupid decisions.
Right, right.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.412
Uh, did he, uh, did he
mention where in Canada?

11:44.453 --> 11:46.789
Like I said, I told him
to keep me out of it.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.624
But if you have a card,
I'll call you

11:48.666 --> 11:50.126
if he shows back up.
Yeah.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.545
Absolutely. Thank you.
Have a good one.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.338
Yeah, you, too.
All right.

12:06.308 --> 12:07.935
You believe her?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.729
Yeah. You?

12:09.770 --> 12:11.856
Yeah.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.610
(both exhale)

12:16.652 --> 12:19.280
You okay, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.532
Are you okay?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.286
Thank you. That was...

12:25.327 --> 12:26.787
Thank you.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.830
It was nothing.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.206
It wasn't.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.167
But...

12:31.208 --> 12:32.668
Thanks, Lesley.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.044
Yeah, well,

12:34.086 --> 12:35.629
I wouldn't have wanted
to get caught

12:35.671 --> 12:37.506
with all of you guys here, so...

12:37.548 --> 12:39.467
All right, we should go.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.594
Um...

12:41.635 --> 12:44.513
I sort of think
maybe we should

12:44.555 --> 12:46.557
stay here, you know,
until it's safe?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.850
Just lay low
for a while?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.643
No, I have to find Jess.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.437
You shouldn't go
back to the city.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.856
The cops are obviously
still looking for you.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.232
For us.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.193
Yeah, and your girlfriend
saved the day.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.445
Which is why maybe we should
just stay here until it's safe.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.447
I'm not gonna stay here, Felix,
I'm happy

13:01.489 --> 13:03.324
to call a cab and go talk
to this dude by myself.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.909
Okay, obviously,
I'll come with you.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.452
Murphy, you may want
to wait for the cops

13:06.494 --> 13:09.789
to, you know, back out
of the driveway first.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.501
Is that okay?

13:13.542 --> 13:15.628
(faint hip-hop music playing)

13:17.379 --> 13:20.090
Yo, you hear
about Josiah's wife?

13:22.009 --> 13:23.135
Yeah.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.595
It's brutal.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.223
I could've sworn
it was here.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.766
I-I don't know, man.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.518
I'll just

13:30.559 --> 13:32.978
get a new phone, I guess.
Anyway, I got to head to work.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.856
Work?

13:35.898 --> 13:38.317
Yeah, my cousin runs
this sandwich shop.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.903
It's not ideal,
but whatever.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.239
You think they're looking
to hire anyone else?

13:43.280 --> 13:44.448
You want a regular job?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.534
What? Maybe I've changed.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.619
Well, he's looking for another
dishwasher if you're interested.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.664
All right, let's go.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.337
(dog barking in distance)

13:58.379 --> 14:00.422
(knocking)

14:04.468 --> 14:06.554
(clears her throat)

14:08.806 --> 14:11.183
Hi, could I help you?

14:11.225 --> 14:14.228
Uh, we just have a...
(clears her throat)

14:14.270 --> 14:16.981
...a few questions, um...

14:17.022 --> 14:19.817
We're looking
for Jennifer Walker?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.445
Oh.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.489
Oh, um...

14:25.531 --> 14:27.408
Why don't you come in?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.661
Sure.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.038
Forward, Pretzel.
There's a ledge.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.137
Here you go.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.141
So...

14:52.182 --> 14:54.643
how did you guys know Jennifer?

14:54.685 --> 14:57.605
I didn't know her, but, um...

14:57.646 --> 14:59.815
we were just reading about

14:59.857 --> 15:01.859
her case
in some old newspapers,

15:01.901 --> 15:03.611
and... I don't know.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.321
You know, we just felt

15:05.362 --> 15:07.907
compelled to-to find her.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.036
Well, at least somebody does.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.538
Yeah, uh, I do want to ask...

15:14.580 --> 15:16.957
uh... just when we were,

15:16.999 --> 15:19.501
when we were reading
about the case, um--

15:19.543 --> 15:23.380
You want to know why I was
arrested in the first place?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.717
Yes. If-- Yes.
(chuckles)

15:26.759 --> 15:28.886
Please.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.680
Hmm.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.683
It's okay. I can talk about it.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.104
Um, I had just married

15:39.146 --> 15:41.273
my ex-wife, Jenny's aunt.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.860
Uh, this one Saturday I was
on my way to a camping trip,

15:44.902 --> 15:47.404
and I saw Jenny walking home
from swim practice.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.115
Mm-hmm.
I offered her a ride.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.035
Her brother was supposed
to pick her up,

15:53.077 --> 15:55.788
but he never showed, so...

15:55.829 --> 15:58.999
I just drove her home
and went on my trip.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.504
When I got home...

16:03.545 --> 16:05.965
my house was swamped
with police.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.592
And before I know it,

16:08.634 --> 16:10.761
I'm being arrested for...

16:10.803 --> 16:12.596
kidnapping my niece.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.725
I'm... so sorry.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.728
You said her brother was
supposed to pick her up?

16:19.770 --> 16:21.230
Yeah.

16:21.271 --> 16:24.358
He was probably just
getting high or something.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.736
Anyway...

16:27.778 --> 16:29.905
uh, I was released
right away.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.242
After that, I dedicated
all my time to finding

16:33.283 --> 16:36.161
who was really responsible
for Jenny's disappearance.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.087
And... anything?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.714
Did you find anything?

16:46.755 --> 16:49.633
Yeah, she suffered
from pretty severe depression.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.927
And...

16:53.595 --> 16:55.973
I came to the conclusion that...

16:56.015 --> 16:58.100
she killed herself.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.602
But her body was never found.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.938
And she got
a new identity.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.732
So she was running
from someone.

17:04.773 --> 17:05.733
REDFORD:
Yeah.

17:05.774 --> 17:08.569
Well, I think that, um...

17:09.945 --> 17:13.032
I think that she was
running from herself.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.452
I don't think so.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.581
I mean, that's just
your theory, but...

17:20.622 --> 17:23.292
it's pretty possible
that she never returned home

17:23.333 --> 17:25.294
because she was
too scared of someone.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.629
I don't think so.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.089
Do you know
where her brother lives?

17:29.131 --> 17:31.592
I haven't heard anything
about him in years.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.094
Where's her-- what about
her parents, where are they?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.722
Her dad was never really there.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.308
And, yeah, her mom's still here.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.894
We wouldn't want to bother her.
Okay, what's her address?
Where is she?

17:41.935 --> 17:43.687
I send her a holiday card
every year.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.272
Would you like me to grab it?

17:45.314 --> 17:47.399
Please.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.612
Thanks for your help
in there.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.697
What was the noise
you were making?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.366
The noise that was coming
from-from your general area?

17:56.408 --> 17:58.494
"Noise"?
Yes!

17:58.535 --> 18:00.287
Right in the middle
of when he was talking.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.747
It was like...
(vocalizing)

18:01.789 --> 18:03.957
Oh, I was uh...
It's rude.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.835
I was solving a Rubik's cube.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.170
A Rubik's cube?

18:08.212 --> 18:10.047
Yes! I was solving
a Rubik's cube.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.591
Because I was uncomfortable--
you made that poor guy relive

18:12.633 --> 18:14.760
what was probably, like, the
worst experience of his life.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.929
Oh, I'm sorry
you were uncomfortable, Felix,

18:16.970 --> 18:18.680
while we were trying to find
our kidnapped friend.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.599
Well...

18:20.641 --> 18:23.102
don't think this girl had
anything to do with that.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.062
It sounds like she
killed herself.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.480
We should go
back to Canada.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.774
I'm not going anywhere
until I figure this out.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.192
I-I want to talk to the mom.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.152
Murphy, I don't think

18:32.194 --> 18:33.987
we should go barging in
on some grieving mother.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.489
We're trying
to find her daughter.
No, we're not!

18:35.531 --> 18:37.199
Yeah, we are!
No, we are not!

18:37.241 --> 18:39.034
According to you,
we're trying to find

18:39.076 --> 18:40.994
the person
who was after her daughter,

18:41.036 --> 18:43.080
who maybe mistook our friend
for her daughter

18:43.122 --> 18:45.624
and now has her... hostage?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.376
Yes, which could be
Jennifer's brother.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.837
I just want to know
if the mom knows where he is.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.380
Murphy...
I need to ask her.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.841
That doesn't even line up
with your own theory.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.384
Why?

18:55.425 --> 18:58.095
Because you said you think
whoever took Jess

18:58.137 --> 18:59.930
thought she was Jennifer Walker.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.223
Don't you think
the brother would know

19:01.265 --> 19:02.391
he didn't take
his actual sister?

19:02.432 --> 19:03.976
No, it's been ten years.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.727
He probably doesn't
even recognize her.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.274
No. Murphy, that's not...

19:10.315 --> 19:12.109
how that works, I'm sorry.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.902
But...

19:13.944 --> 19:16.280
you would know
it wasn't your sister.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.411
Well... I mean...

19:22.452 --> 19:24.705
apparently he does drugs
and stuff, so, I mean,

19:24.746 --> 19:26.540
he could-- I don't know, Felix!

19:26.582 --> 19:28.917
I know it sounds crazy to you,
but I know it's right.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.919
I do, I just know it!

19:30.961 --> 19:32.796
I-I know it.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.798
Can you just drive us
to Jennifer's mom's, please?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.800
No.
Please, please, Felix?

19:36.842 --> 19:39.178
Please?
No.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.138
Okay? No.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.140
I'm drawing the line
right here, right now.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.100
Absolutely not, no.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.895
BONNIE:
Are you guys reporters?

19:47.936 --> 19:49.688
No. No, no.
No.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.316
We just, we're just
trying to figure out

19:52.357 --> 19:54.401
what happened
to your daughter.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.778
Nobody's come around
asking about her in a long time.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.697
Feels like everybody's
forgotten about her but me.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.491
But I know that she's, um,
she's out there

20:01.533 --> 20:04.494
still somewhere.
I actually keep that light on

20:04.536 --> 20:06.997
in the window every night
just in case she comes home.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.249
Can I ask...

20:09.291 --> 20:12.419
um, was your daughter depressed

20:12.461 --> 20:14.630
at all?
I mean...

20:14.671 --> 20:16.131
what teenager is happy?

20:16.173 --> 20:18.258
But, I mean, did she have

20:18.300 --> 20:21.053
any friends or...?
Yes.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.013
Of course she had friends.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.265
Uh, there was Susannah Jenkins.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.185
MURPHY: Mm-hmm.
And, um...

20:28.227 --> 20:30.687
I know that there were others,

20:30.729 --> 20:32.064
but she-she was
always with Suzie.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.482
And where is your son
these days?

20:33.523 --> 20:35.359
BONNIE:
Oh, who knows?

20:35.400 --> 20:37.069
MURPHY:
You don't know
where your son is?

20:37.110 --> 20:38.946
No, I don't.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.156
Well... (stammers)

20:41.198 --> 20:42.824
...do you think
it's a possibility

20:42.866 --> 20:44.451
that Jennifer was...

20:44.493 --> 20:46.787
running from him?

20:46.828 --> 20:48.705
Or from someone? Because
she bought a new identity.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.958
So that's the only
thing that makes sense.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.877
BONNIE:
You see?

20:54.836 --> 20:57.297
I knew that she didn't
kill herself.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.803
Just-just hang on. Uh, my-my
phone is charging upstairs.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.680
I'm gonna call the detective
on this case.

21:04.721 --> 21:08.308
I want you guys to tell him
everything that you know. Okay?

21:08.350 --> 21:10.727
Yeah! Sounds good.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.729
(chuckles)
We're leaving.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.898
What? No. Felix.
That's it. Come on.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.942
Murphy, she's calling the cops.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.443
Okay? We're leaving.
I want to know what
she knows about the brother.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.528
They're not gonna be here
for, like, five minutes.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.821
We have some time.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.447
A few mi-- Are you insane?

21:22.489 --> 21:25.158
I didn't get to ask her...
Murphy, I don't care. Go.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.785
For-forward, Pretzel.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.078
Felix.
(shushes)

21:28.120 --> 21:29.663
What are...
(shushes)

21:33.166 --> 21:34.960
(exhales)

21:37.754 --> 21:39.840
(door closes)

21:46.763 --> 21:49.933
Ah, Mrs. Walker, hi.
This is Detective Miller.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.893
What can I do for you?

21:51.935 --> 21:54.479
There were some people here
with information about Jenny.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.732
They said that she bought
a fake identity.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.276
That right?
And who were these people?

21:59.318 --> 22:00.944
I didn't get their names, but,

22:00.986 --> 22:03.196
um, they were a couple of kids,

22:03.238 --> 22:04.990
they were in their 20s,
probably.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.410
Uh, the girl, she was blind.

22:10.078 --> 22:12.414
Wait, what?

22:12.456 --> 22:14.583
They're looking for a girl
named Jennifer Walker.

22:14.624 --> 22:17.336
Now, she was reported missing
ten years ago.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.629
Jennifer Walker?

22:19.671 --> 22:21.381
That doesn't make any sense.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.258
Why do I recognize that name?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.970
Oh, my God. Uh...

22:27.012 --> 22:28.889
Wait, I just saw
her case file.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.350
Uh-huh. Here it is.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.101
Jennifer Walker,
reported kidnapped

22:33.143 --> 22:35.020
from Northern Presbyterian
Hospital yesterday.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.521
Let me see that.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.648
Why wasn't I notified?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.067
'Cause Keith sucked at his job.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.777
Wait, wait, wait.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.612
Was hospitalized
for smoke inhalation

22:43.653 --> 22:45.530
the night of the fire
at Downtown Empire Arcade.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.824
That wasn't Jennifer Walker.
That had to have been Jess.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.576
I'll find out what I
can from the hospital.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.121
So she must have bought
that girl's identity,

22:53.163 --> 22:55.082
and Murphy thinks
that Jess's disappearance

22:55.123 --> 22:57.042
has something to do
with the real Jennifer Walker,

22:57.084 --> 22:59.378
and that's why she's trying to
find out what happened to her.

22:59.419 --> 23:02.172
I guess that we should find out
what happened to her, too.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.924
Might lead us right
to Murphy and them.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.468
(scoffs) Good luck. The
mother's a real piece of work.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.886
I've found nothing in ten years.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.763
SARAH:
Get this.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.973
The only visitor she had at
the hospital was Darnell James.

23:12.015 --> 23:14.101
Hmm? Come on.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.982
Oh. Hey.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.402
Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

23:23.443 --> 23:26.279
Ooh. Little early for whiskey.

23:26.321 --> 23:29.116
Yeah, well, wasn't hungry.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.201
In the mood for a drink.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.953
Fair enough.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.956
So what's this about?

23:35.997 --> 23:37.791
I know we only met once,
at, uh, Jules's funeral,

23:37.833 --> 23:40.460
but I had some questions
that I wanted to ask you,

23:40.502 --> 23:42.087
and bringing you
into the station

23:42.129 --> 23:44.548
felt weird, so...

23:44.589 --> 23:46.133
I don't know.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.970
Long-winded way
of explaining the random call.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.721
Anyhow, how are you?

23:53.473 --> 23:55.350
I'm fine.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.893
Just...

23:57.853 --> 23:59.146
Life?

24:00.313 --> 24:02.357
Yeah, pretty much.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.861
Yeah.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.447
I saw your chief,
uh, got arrested.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.282
(clears throat)
Yeah.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.826
By me.
(chuckles)

24:12.868 --> 24:14.578
Hmm.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.497
Wish Jules would've been there
to see that.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.458
Yeah.

24:19.499 --> 24:22.377
Can I get you a beer before
the questioning begins?

24:22.419 --> 24:24.713
Sure, yeah.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.340
(door closes)

24:27.382 --> 24:28.967
Hey, how'd it go?

24:29.009 --> 24:31.636
Oh, yeah, just great, actually.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.555
Jess, come on in!
We were actually

24:33.597 --> 24:35.390
getting somewhere until
he dragged me out of there.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.309
Really, Murphy?
She was calling the cops.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.435
Wait, who was calling the cops?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.769
Jennifer Walker's
mother.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.313
We also went and visited her

24:41.354 --> 24:42.731
and it wasn't at all invasive
or extremely sad.

24:42.772 --> 24:44.816
MURPHY:
Okay, I'm gonna lie down,

24:44.858 --> 24:47.110
and then we'll figure out
next steps.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.237
Sure.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.954
(whimpers softly)

24:59.873 --> 25:03.126
Don't. You're the last person
I want to talk to right now.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.836
I thought you desperately
wanted to find me.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.463
The real you, the real one.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.590
Not this in my head,
not this stupid...

25:08.632 --> 25:10.091
Just leave me alone.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.929
God...

25:15.222 --> 25:16.932
You don't really want that.
Yes, I do.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.684
You don't.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.312
This might be the only version
you see of me again.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.314
You know that.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.441
Don't say that.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.862
No.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.824
No.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.119
Jess.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.871
She stole the keys from my purse

25:39.913 --> 25:41.957
and-and parked my car

25:41.998 --> 25:45.669
down the street and then put
the keys back in my purse

25:45.710 --> 25:48.630
and watched me report
my own car being stolen.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.383
(both laugh)
You know, she did
the same thing to me

25:51.424 --> 25:53.343
in high school?
(chuckles)

25:53.385 --> 25:55.262
And I cannot tell
you how many times

25:55.303 --> 25:57.806
I'd be peacefully taking
a shower and she'd sneak in

25:57.847 --> 26:00.892
and dump, like,
a bucket of ice water on me.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.686
She thought she was hilarious.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.563
I know, right?

26:05.814 --> 26:07.899
(phone buzzes)

26:08.984 --> 26:11.236
I should, I should
get back to work.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.572
Yeah, I got to go home
and feed Miles anyway.

26:13.613 --> 26:16.366
Oh, wait,
you still have Jules's cat?

26:16.408 --> 26:20.704
Yeah, I, uh, thought it would be
a nice reminder of her.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.914
But now I'm just a single guy
with a cat.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.291
(chuckles)

26:25.417 --> 26:27.586
No, no, you're good.
I got it.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.504
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.548
Thanks.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.341
Uh, sorry I couldn't

26:33.383 --> 26:35.010
be more help
with the Jess thing.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.261
It's all good.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.763
I had a nice time anyway.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.308
Yeah. So did I.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.435
(exhales)

26:43.476 --> 26:45.395
The train's this way.
(clears throat)

26:45.437 --> 26:50.066
You, uh, you want me
to walk you there?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.485
Uh, no, that's all right.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.279
Okay.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.406
Well, uh...
(chuckles)

26:56.448 --> 26:58.241
Bye.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.076
Yeah.
Yeah.

I know.
(chuckles)

27:29.189 --> 27:30.690
(laughs softly)

27:32.609 --> 27:35.654
It's a little bit
out of order, but...

27:35.695 --> 27:37.280
you want to grab dinner?

27:37.322 --> 27:39.324
What? No...
Never got that lunch.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.368
No, my God,
I'm still on the clock.

27:41.409 --> 27:44.037
Are you kidding?
I'm literally still working.
So?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.790
(phone buzzing)
Oh. Hang on. I have to,

27:46.831 --> 27:48.416
I have to get this. Hello?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.710
GENE:
Hey, how'd it go with Darnell?

27:50.752 --> 27:53.213
Uh, sort of a waste of time.

27:53.254 --> 27:55.548
(quietly):
A waste of time?

27:55.590 --> 27:57.467
I'm on my way back now, though.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.594
Actually, can you go check
on the guys at Trey's place?

27:59.636 --> 28:01.429
Make sure they're not sleeping?

28:01.471 --> 28:03.348
They've been there for hours
and, uh,

28:03.390 --> 28:05.183
I haven't heard anything.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.436
Yeah, okay. Bye.

28:08.478 --> 28:09.854
Wait, Trey?

28:09.896 --> 28:11.398
Huh? Yeah.
Trey Williams?

28:11.439 --> 28:14.234
How do you...
Why are the cops
at Trey's place?

28:16.236 --> 28:17.696
Sarah, what did he do?

28:17.737 --> 28:19.072
He murdered three people.

28:19.114 --> 28:22.075
What? No, he didn't.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.370
Trust me, I would know if
he murdered three people.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.789
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.
W-What are you doing?

28:27.831 --> 28:30.667
What do you think I'm doing?
Trey's my boy,

28:30.709 --> 28:32.335
I'm not gonna let him go down
for something he didn't do.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.130
No, hey... Hey!
Sarah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.673
Whoa...
(door closes)

28:40.677 --> 28:42.679
(siren wailing)

28:42.721 --> 28:44.264
(horn honks)

28:44.305 --> 28:46.599
(tires screeching)

28:56.943 --> 28:58.278
Trey. Thank God I caught you.

28:58.319 --> 28:59.779
What the hell are
you doing here, man?

28:59.821 --> 29:01.406
Turn left. You can't get
any closer to your place.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.742
Why?
It's surrounded by cops.
Just go. Go, go, go.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.076
DARNELL:
Go, go.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.170
Oh, my God.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.338
I... I got it.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.301
I could've gotten it.
Sure.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.643
(exhales)

29:30.685 --> 29:33.146
What?

29:33.188 --> 29:35.648
Can we talk?

29:35.690 --> 29:37.692
You want to talk?

29:37.734 --> 29:40.695
Yes, Felix. I talk.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.739
What do you want to talk about?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.866
Jess.

29:44.908 --> 29:49.621
(scoffs) Okay, well,
what-what about, uh...

29:49.662 --> 29:51.331
What about Jess?

29:51.372 --> 29:52.749
I mean,
what do you think?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.043
Do you think Murphy's right?

29:55.084 --> 29:56.711
No.
(scoffs)

29:58.630 --> 30:00.673
I don't think
this Jennifer Walker girl

30:00.715 --> 30:02.133
has anything to do with Jess.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.551
It sounds a lot
like she killed herself.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.053
I don't think
there's some big mystery,

30:05.094 --> 30:06.971
I think Jess is...

30:09.766 --> 30:12.977
Hey, look, man, Felix,
I'm-I'm really sorry, okay?

30:13.019 --> 30:15.605
This whole thing,
I just, I-I don't know.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.565
Now we're all gonna
go to prison, so...

30:17.607 --> 30:20.693
Oh, uh,
hang on a second.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.279
Maybe not.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.490
Our DNA isn't at the gravesite,

30:25.532 --> 30:27.617
and your sister said
everything else they have on us

30:27.659 --> 30:28.827
is circumstantial.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.620
But Murphy?

30:30.662 --> 30:32.789
Is screwed, I know. She
won't go back to Canada.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.499
All she cares about

30:34.541 --> 30:36.501
is Jennifer Walker.
Yeah, well,
you and I both know

30:36.543 --> 30:38.253
that's just a stall tactic,
okay?

30:38.294 --> 30:41.172
Eventually, Murphy's gonna
come to terms with the fact

30:41.214 --> 30:43.341
that Jess is...

30:44.300 --> 30:46.135
That Jess is gone.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.972
Yeah, well, why don't you
go tell her that, Max?

30:49.013 --> 30:51.057
I'm sure it'll go over great.

30:52.058 --> 30:55.270
(exhales)
Look, this is moot

30:55.311 --> 30:58.481
because she's never
gonna agree to go.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.942
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.819
Maybe she doesn't need to.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.250
Jess, you can
come back now, please.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.835
Come back.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.337
I don't know.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.549
I mean, it could work.
It's... brutal, though.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.844
I can't think of
any other way.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.597
Well?

31:30.638 --> 31:32.432
I guess.

31:32.473 --> 31:36.269
Listen, you got
this, man. Okay?

31:36.311 --> 31:37.562
(bottles clink)

31:37.604 --> 31:39.480
Okay.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.198
FELIX:
Murph?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.159
I think
I found something.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.915
I stole Jennifer's yearbook

31:56.956 --> 31:58.666
from the mom's house.
Yeah?

31:58.708 --> 32:02.295
And apparently,
she had a boyfriend.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.796
Seriously?
Yeah.

32:03.838 --> 32:07.425
And he left
this whole heartfelt message

32:07.467 --> 32:08.593
and his number,

32:08.635 --> 32:09.677
so I called it.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.512
He sounded super shady, so...

32:11.554 --> 32:13.056
I think we should go
talk to him.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.515
He lives in Detroit.

32:14.557 --> 32:16.559
Oh, my God, Felix.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.227
I love you.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.730
Thank you. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.236
MAX:
Hey.
Hi. Where's, uh, Felix?

32:27.278 --> 32:28.988
MAX:
Oh, he's just, uh,
he's just waiting in the car.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.991
Okay. Well,
I'll see you later.
Yeah. Yeah.

32:35.411 --> 32:37.914
(chuckles softly)
Relax, we'll-we'll be back soon.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.290
Yeah. Just, um...

32:39.332 --> 32:41.584
Take care of yourself. Yeah.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.003
Always do.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.880
Find the car, Pretzel. Go.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.590
Find the car.
(car door closes)

32:47.632 --> 32:49.300
Good boy.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.886
(grunts)
You have the address?

32:51.928 --> 32:53.304
Yeah.

32:53.346 --> 32:54.806
Where'd you get it?

32:54.847 --> 32:57.141
The Internet.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.227
(mockingly):
"The Internet."

32:59.268 --> 33:00.937
(scoffs)

33:01.980 --> 33:04.190
Hello?
What?

33:04.232 --> 33:06.401
Nothing.
Usually just when I mock you,

33:06.442 --> 33:08.152
you usually get all pissy.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.904
Oh, yeah, no. Sorry.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.407
I'm, uh... Was putting
the address in my phone.

33:12.448 --> 33:15.743
But I'm... Was putting the
address in my phone. (chuckles)

33:15.785 --> 33:17.328
Okay.

33:17.370 --> 33:18.621
Ready?
Let's go.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.456
Okay.
(engine starts)

33:20.498 --> 33:22.583
(sniffles)

33:25.503 --> 33:27.505
How you doing?

33:27.547 --> 33:29.257
I'm okay.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.300
You need some alone time?

33:31.342 --> 33:34.429
The opposite.
(chuckles)

33:40.935 --> 33:43.479
(inhales)

33:43.521 --> 33:45.898
That, um...

33:45.940 --> 33:47.483
What?

33:47.525 --> 33:48.901
Nothing.

33:48.943 --> 33:50.903
Just, uh...

33:50.945 --> 33:53.031
Feels nice.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.326
Oh.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.329
Oh?
Okay.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.540
(grunts softly)

34:10.506 --> 34:13.009
(tires squeal)

34:20.892 --> 34:22.852
MURPHY:
Wh-What are you doing?

34:22.894 --> 34:25.146
Why are... Why
are we stopped?
So,

34:25.188 --> 34:28.441
I'm staring at, like,
a million cops right now.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.401
Okay. So?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.445
So?
(scoffs)

34:32.487 --> 34:34.113
You're wanted for murder,
Murphy. Don't you think

34:34.155 --> 34:35.114
there's a couple cops
looking for you?
I... Well...

34:35.156 --> 34:36.699
Miles from Chicago, Felix.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.701
Yeah, well, I don't know.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.953
You know, I think
you should get in the trunk

34:40.995 --> 34:42.205
just till we pass them.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.623
Okay? Here, I'll help you.
What?

34:43.664 --> 34:45.333
You want me to get in the trunk?
Yes.

34:45.374 --> 34:46.375
Are you crazy?

34:46.417 --> 34:47.919
No, I'm not crazy.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.046
(car door closes)
Okay? I know you didn't see,

34:50.088 --> 34:52.465
but there's, like,
a blockade of police.
(car door closes)

34:52.507 --> 34:55.468
Wait, why c... Why can't I just
pull my seat down in the car?

34:55.510 --> 34:58.054
Because it's not as safe, okay?
I'm gonna put you in the trunk,

34:58.096 --> 34:59.639
and I'm gonna cover
you with coats.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.516
Yeah, man. I was really
hoping to talk to him.

35:01.557 --> 35:03.226
Ex... Hey, excuse me?

35:03.267 --> 35:05.019
Excuse me. Wh... Sorry.
Hang on a sec.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.146
What's with the...
all the cops everywhere?

35:07.188 --> 35:10.566
Uh, up where?
I don't see anything.
Yeah, no, they're not...

35:10.608 --> 35:11.818
Where are we?

35:11.859 --> 35:13.528
In a parking lot.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.238
Got it. And are we close

35:15.279 --> 35:16.781
to the Canadian border,
by any chance?

35:16.823 --> 35:18.282
Wait.
Oh, yeah. The bridge is,

35:18.324 --> 35:19.617
like, a block that way.
Okay.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.410
Thank you so much.
Yeah, for sure.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.079
I don't know.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.289
Some guy. Anyway...

35:25.331 --> 35:27.041
Look, Murphy...

35:27.083 --> 35:29.210
Are you kidding me, Felix?
Murphy,

35:29.252 --> 35:30.753
we have to get to Canada.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.130
Otherwise,
you're gonna go to jail

35:32.171 --> 35:33.631
for, like,
the rest of your life.
No!

35:33.673 --> 35:36.134
We have to find Jess, Felix!

35:36.175 --> 35:37.927
(sighs)

35:37.969 --> 35:39.470
What?

35:39.512 --> 35:40.930
Nothing.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.057
Oh, my God.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.644
What are you doing?
Come on, Pretzel.

35:50.022 --> 35:52.859
Have fun in Canada,
you dick!

35:58.406 --> 35:59.866
(phone buzzing)

35:59.907 --> 36:01.033
Hey.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.368
GENE:
Hey. Where are you?

36:02.410 --> 36:03.870
I'm at Trey's.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.289
I didn't mean
that you had to wait there.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.833
That's way below your pay grade.
No, I know. I just thought...

36:08.875 --> 36:11.961
I figured an-an extra set
of eyes wouldn't hurt.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.880
Thank you,
but you should go home.

36:13.921 --> 36:15.756
Get some rest.

36:15.798 --> 36:19.093
Yeah. Okay.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.303
Okay.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.013
Night.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.309
(phone buzzes)

36:38.905 --> 36:40.865
(sighs)

36:40.907 --> 36:42.700
(thunder rumbling)

36:42.742 --> 36:45.119
Murphy!
Just go to Canada, Felix.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.622
I'm not letting
you go to prison.

36:47.663 --> 36:50.416
I don't need some dude's help,
thank you very much.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.127
I'll find Jennifer's boyfriend
by myself.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.381
Oh, my God.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.845
Of course,
there is no boyfriend.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.473
God, I'm such an idiot!

37:05.514 --> 37:08.142
Listen, I only did what I did

37:08.184 --> 37:11.395
because you don't listen
to anyone. All right?

37:11.437 --> 37:13.648
And where was Max in all this?

37:14.649 --> 37:17.318
It was
his stupid idea, huh?

37:17.360 --> 37:18.986
So what?

37:19.028 --> 37:21.530
So he could bone your sister
in peace while you abduct me?

37:21.572 --> 37:23.616
(chuckles):
It's not like that.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.410
Then what's it like, Felix?
What is it like?
God, you're so...

37:26.452 --> 37:28.287
stubborn sometimes. I...

37:28.329 --> 37:31.666
We had nothing
but good intentions,

37:31.707 --> 37:33.542
okay?
Whatever.

37:33.584 --> 37:37.171
You know what really sucks?
You know what really sucks?

37:37.213 --> 37:39.131
Ever since I've known you,

37:39.173 --> 37:42.260
even when I, like,
hated your guts, I never felt...

37:42.301 --> 37:44.971
I-I never felt disabled
around you.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.432
What?

37:48.474 --> 37:50.226
You were a dick to me

37:50.268 --> 37:52.311
just like you were
to everyone else.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.147
Oh. Thanks.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.857
I'm saying you weren't...

37:56.899 --> 37:59.402
nice to me just...

37:59.443 --> 38:02.738
because I can't see.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.324
Okay.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.159
Well...

38:07.201 --> 38:09.912
So, what's your point?

38:09.954 --> 38:12.456
(crying): That you
just used it against me.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.919
You knew I wasn't gonna be able
to see where we were going.

38:18.254 --> 38:21.924
Do you have any idea how
worthless that makes me feel?

38:25.344 --> 38:26.846
Just please go.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.431
I can't do that.
Why?

38:28.472 --> 38:30.391
Because!

38:30.433 --> 38:32.893
Because why, Felix?
Because I'll make
sure you don't go

38:32.935 --> 38:34.061
to prison
for the rest of your life!

38:34.103 --> 38:35.396
What about Jess?

38:35.438 --> 38:36.480
You're just gonna
let her get killed?

38:36.522 --> 38:37.940
Jess is already dead, Murphy!

38:42.945 --> 38:44.530
She's already...

38:45.656 --> 38:47.616
You take that back.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.452
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Take it back.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.537
I-I didn't mean...

38:51.579 --> 38:53.914
for that to come out
like that, okay?

38:53.956 --> 38:56.000
But, Murphy,

38:56.042 --> 38:59.962
whoever took Jess
from the hospital

39:00.004 --> 39:02.631
killed her.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.967
I didn't want to accept it,
either.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.053
She called me.

39:07.094 --> 39:08.471
You don't know
that that was her.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.931
I do. I do know. I heard her.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.893
Breathing.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.480
You heard her
breathing, Murphy.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.066
Come on.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.445
Listen, I can't

39:24.487 --> 39:26.364
just keep
following your gut

39:26.405 --> 39:28.824
because she was your
best friend, okay?

39:28.866 --> 39:31.285
She was my best friend, too.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.829
And you know what my gut says?

39:33.871 --> 39:36.791
That she was wanted dead

39:36.832 --> 39:39.919
by a very dangerous
drug dealer,

39:39.960 --> 39:44.507
and now she's
nowhere to be found, so...

39:59.063 --> 40:00.606
We tried.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.691
Just go, Felix.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.444
I'm serious.
(breathes shakily)

40:05.486 --> 40:08.155
I can't leave you.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.370
What did you think?
You just thought I was gonna...

40:15.913 --> 40:19.667
...go to Canada and, like,
fall in love with you? (scoffs)

40:19.708 --> 40:21.794
(laughing)

40:24.547 --> 40:28.134
You're so pathetic!

40:28.175 --> 40:30.261
(laughing)

40:34.098 --> 40:35.766
I'm so sorry
I slept with you once

40:35.808 --> 40:37.893
because Max wasn't around.
