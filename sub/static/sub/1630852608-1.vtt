Okay, go search, go search.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.200
(dog barking)

00:58.333 --> 00:59.533
Hey, sweetie.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.033
(laughs)

01:01.166 --> 01:02.700
Good girl, Maxie.

01:02.834 --> 01:03.700
Come here, baby.

01:03.834 --> 01:05.467
Good girl.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.367
Wow, that is one talented dog.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.967
You must have a strong scent.

01:10.433 --> 01:12.266
You know, when you asked me
to spend the morning with you,

01:12.400 --> 01:13.600
this is not what I had in mind.

01:13.734 --> 01:14.967
Well, you have the
eternal gratitude

01:15.100 --> 01:17.600
of the entire Kenai
Mountain Rescue Team.

01:17.734 --> 01:18.600
Why don't you
show your gratitude

01:18.734 --> 01:19.700
by having a drink with me?

01:19.834 --> 01:21.433
It's seven in the morning.

01:21.567 --> 01:22.700
I don't mean
like a drink drink.

01:22.834 --> 01:25.200
I mean like a coffee
or a hot chocolate.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.200
Yeah, I would love to.

01:26.333 --> 01:27.200
Yeah?

01:27.333 --> 01:28.433
Great, then it's a date.

01:28.567 --> 01:30.700
Well, I got to
get to the cafe.

01:30.834 --> 01:32.133
Gotta help my mom

01:32.266 --> 01:33.367
'cause my sisters are actually
coming in from New York

01:33.500 --> 01:34.533
for my mom's birthday.

01:34.667 --> 01:35.800
Another time then.

01:36.834 --> 01:38.533
I don't know.

01:38.667 --> 01:39.767
The locals might start talking

01:39.900 --> 01:40.934
if they knew that I
was dating the guy

01:41.066 --> 01:42.700
renting my parents' guest house.

01:42.834 --> 01:43.967
Dating?

01:44.100 --> 01:44.967
I'm just talking
about getting a drink,

01:45.100 --> 01:46.066
but if you want to date.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.633
You excited to see your sisters?

01:48.767 --> 01:50.533
Yeah, I am.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.033
It's also complicated.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.967
You're talking
to an only child.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.767
Has it always been complicated?

01:56.900 --> 01:59.266
No, we were really
close when we were little,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.166
but I don't know.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.200
Maybe it's normal for
siblings to grow apart

02:03.333 --> 02:04.767
as they get older.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.934
It doesn't help that we live
on other sides of the country.

02:07.066 --> 02:08.532
So what are they like?

02:08.667 --> 02:10.433
How to describe my sisters?

02:14.066 --> 02:17.033
(cars honking)

02:17.166 --> 02:20.500
And finally, I would
suggest a line item accounting

02:20.633 --> 02:22.867
to ferret out any redundancies.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.600
To be competitive, you're
going to need to streamline.

02:25.734 --> 02:26.834
That is, if you decide

02:26.967 --> 02:29.500
to bring your business
to Crest Financial.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.667
Thank you for walking
us through that, Hannah.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.000
We expect to make our
decision in the next week.

02:34.133 --> 02:35.166
Very good.

02:35.300 --> 02:36.166
Just curious if
you could share more

02:36.300 --> 02:38.433
of your longterm strategy?

02:38.567 --> 02:39.934
Well, that would
be much more complex,

02:40.066 --> 02:42.834
but I would be happy to work
out a more expanded analysis.

02:42.967 --> 02:44.266
I could get started
on that right away.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.767
Well then, we'll look
forward to reading it.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.133
Thank you for coming in.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.533
Are we celebrating
a new account?

02:59.667 --> 03:01.934
Not sure, but I think
we have a good shot.

03:02.066 --> 03:03.100
Still have work to do.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.867
Where is everyone?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.500
A bunch of folks cut out
early to get drinks at O'Brien's

03:08.633 --> 03:09.600
for Charlie's birthday.

03:09.734 --> 03:11.066
Oh, that reminds me, did you-

03:11.200 --> 03:13.000
Checked you in for
your flight to Anchorage,

03:13.133 --> 03:14.567
upgraded you to business class,

03:14.700 --> 03:17.000
and I got a car to pick you
up when you land in Alaska.

03:17.133 --> 03:18.233
Great.

03:18.367 --> 03:19.900
Oh, and I need to get
a gift for Suzanne.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.233
60's a big year, it needs
to be something special.

03:22.367 --> 03:23.500
You're getting excited

03:23.633 --> 03:24.667
to spend some time
with your sisters?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.166
Yeah, it should be good.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.266
Speaking of,
Beth called to see

03:28.400 --> 03:30.667
if you're meeting at her
place or at the play.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.500
(gasps) The play.

03:32.633 --> 03:33.900
Oh.

03:34.033 --> 03:34.900
You want me to get
her on the phone?

03:35.033 --> 03:36.567
No, no, I better call her.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.266
Okay then, I'll see
you when you get back.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.533
Call or text anytime.

03:39.667 --> 03:40.667
Okay, I will.

03:50.033 --> 03:53.900
(phone ringing)

03:54.033 --> 03:55.400
[Woman] Good afternoon,
doctor's office.

03:55.533 --> 03:56.767
Is Dr. Vogel in?

03:56.900 --> 03:57.767
[Woman] Who's calling, please?

03:57.900 --> 03:59.266
Hannah McBride calling.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.400
[Woman] The line is busy,
would you like his voicemail?

04:01.533 --> 04:03.900
No, no, just if you could
have him give me a ring back,

04:04.033 --> 04:04.900
that would be great.

04:05.033 --> 04:05.900
As soon as possible.

04:06.033 --> 04:07.667
- [Woman] You got it, bye now.
- Bye-bye.

04:10.433 --> 04:14.233
(sighs)

04:14.367 --> 04:15.233
(phone ringing)

04:15.367 --> 04:16.300
- She isn't!
- She is!

04:16.433 --> 04:18.065
Girls, girls.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.065
Melly.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.934
Okay, just...

04:22.767 --> 04:24.800
Hey, Hans, can you
hold on just a sec?

04:24.934 --> 04:26.300
Melly, stop, please.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.500
If you pull the ears like that,
you're going to rip it off.

04:27.633 --> 04:28.500
Thank you.

04:28.633 --> 04:29.500
Hi, sorry.

04:29.633 --> 04:30.734
That doesn't sound good.

04:30.867 --> 04:33.333
No, they're fighting
over Bugsy again.

04:33.467 --> 04:34.333
Bugsy?

04:34.467 --> 04:35.800
Stuffed animal.

04:35.934 --> 04:38.400
Are you coming here or we going
to meet you at the school?

04:39.600 --> 04:40.967
Listen, Beth, I hate
to do this last minute,

04:41.100 --> 04:43.400
but it looks like I'm going
to have to do a rain check

04:43.533 --> 04:44.567
for the play tonight.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.133
No, are you serious?

04:48.266 --> 04:49.967
They're going to
be so disappointed.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.633
Melly's the lead, but
this is Ruby's first play.

04:52.767 --> 04:56.133
I know, I know, but
work's been so crazy.

04:56.266 --> 04:57.633
I just...

04:57.767 --> 04:59.233
I just flew in from San
Francisco late last night

04:59.367 --> 05:01.300
and I'm trying to land
this really big client.

05:01.433 --> 05:03.300
This is twice you've
canceled on us this month.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.967
I know, I'm sorry.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.867
But I'm going to
see you tomorrow.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.633
Okay, I'll make it up
to the girls, I promise.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.300
I'll take them for the day.

05:10.433 --> 05:13.467
I mean, no offense, but
they'll eat you alive.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.700
Besides, I'm not
putting much stock

05:14.834 --> 05:16.567
in your promises these days.

05:16.700 --> 05:17.667
Look, I...

05:18.867 --> 05:21.967
I said I was sorry, I
don't want to fight.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.867
I just want to get
through this trip, okay?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.233
Just can we put everything
aside for Suzanne?

05:27.367 --> 05:28.900
Can you not call her Suzanne?

05:30.367 --> 05:34.200
You do realize this birthday
is the 25th anniversary of...

05:34.333 --> 05:35.467
Yeah, I know.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.033
This time of year, it's
all I can think about.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.233
[Beth] Gotta go.

05:41.367 --> 05:43.734
(slow music)

06:01.066 --> 06:02.200
How's it coming, guys?

06:02.333 --> 06:03.633
We're almost there, right?

06:11.934 --> 06:15.033
(sighs) It's so
beautiful up here.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.367
Gosh, we don't get mountains
like this in upstate New York.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.433
Yeah, we get a ton of
clients from back east.

06:19.567 --> 06:20.934
They all say it's
worth the trip.

06:21.066 --> 06:22.767
Fabulous way to spend
your birthday, Suzanne.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.767
Yeah, I got it pretty good.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.767
So how long have you
guys all known each other?

06:26.900 --> 06:28.700
The four of us went
to Michigan together.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.266
Been friends ever since.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.533
Suzanne guided us on
our first ever summit

06:32.667 --> 06:33.767
when we were sophomores.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.266
Wow.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.934
So you and your husband
been doing this for a while?

06:37.066 --> 06:38.100
Yeah.

06:38.233 --> 06:39.100
I run people up and
down the mountain.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.266
Stewart runs the business

06:40.400 --> 06:42.600
and our indoor climbing
classes for kids.

06:42.734 --> 06:45.467
So, next section
gets pretty steep.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.200
I'm going to need
to put you on belay.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.967
Whatever you say, captain.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.100
Looks like we have
some clouds moving in.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.700
There was snow up
top early this morning,

06:52.834 --> 06:54.200
but the forecast said
it should be clear

06:54.333 --> 06:56.133
by the time we get up there.

06:56.266 --> 06:58.133
(rumbling)

06:58.266 --> 06:59.233
What was that?

07:02.066 --> 07:03.934
Suzanne?

07:04.066 --> 07:06.100
Suzanne!

07:06.233 --> 07:10.100
Suzanne, are you okay?

07:10.233 --> 07:11.100
You drifted off.

07:11.233 --> 07:12.767
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.367
What's up?

07:15.500 --> 07:16.767
Well, I'm headed home.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.367
Gotta sort the rooms
for our special guests.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.166
(laughs) I'm about done
here too, I will join you.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.867
Great, I'll meet you out back.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.767
You're okay, right?

07:26.900 --> 07:27.834
Honey, I am fine.

07:27.967 --> 07:29.100
Will you quit worrying about me?

07:29.233 --> 07:30.500
Well, I just want to make sure

07:30.633 --> 07:32.867
that the birthday girl is happy.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.100
Sweetheart, my birthday
is still a few days away.

07:36.233 --> 07:39.033
Please, don't rush
me out of my fifties.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.500
Come on, 60 is the new 40.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.200
I heard 60 is the new 30.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, well, I wish.

07:45.133 --> 07:47.667
Nope, 60 is still 60.

07:47.800 --> 07:52.600
And you are as beautiful and
vibrant as the day I met you.

07:53.633 --> 07:54.500
(kisses)

07:54.633 --> 07:55.500
Liar.

07:55.633 --> 07:56.600
It's true.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.166
So how was everything
today, gentlemen?

07:59.300 --> 08:03.734
The service and the food was
perfect, Suzanne, as always.

08:03.867 --> 08:04.934
Thank you.

08:05.066 --> 08:06.066
How about a dozen
of these cookies

08:06.200 --> 08:07.333
for the Polar Bear Club?

08:07.467 --> 08:08.333
You got it.

08:08.467 --> 08:09.333
Keep the change.

08:09.467 --> 08:10.633
Here you go.

08:10.767 --> 08:11.633
Be sure to say hello
to Hannah and Beth for me

08:11.767 --> 08:12.633
when they get in.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.166
We will.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.600
Having you girls together is

08:15.734 --> 08:17.834
all she's been talking
about for months.

08:17.967 --> 08:19.200
Oh, don't I know it.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.500
Oh, okay.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.900
Your dad and I are headed home.

08:25.033 --> 08:26.834
Still need to get
the house in order.

08:26.967 --> 08:28.233
Oh, and if you have time,

08:28.367 --> 08:29.900
the monthly invoices
still need to be balanced.

08:30.033 --> 08:31.433
Right, got it.

08:31.567 --> 08:34.500
You know, there is this thing
called software, just saying.

08:34.633 --> 08:37.500
Yeah, well, after we retire
and you're running the cafe,

08:37.633 --> 08:39.833
you can do the invoices
however you want.

08:39.967 --> 08:41.066
Until then...

08:41.200 --> 08:43.000
Abacus, parchment,
paper, and quill?

08:43.133 --> 08:44.000
Very funny.

08:44.133 --> 08:45.100
Ha ha.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.066
You told her to let go.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.900
He was mine first.

08:56.033 --> 08:57.266
You did give him to Ruby.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.500
But I miss him,
I want him back.

08:59.633 --> 09:02.467
Well, sweetie, that's not
really how gift giving works.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.734
We could share.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.800
That's a really good
idea, isn't it, Melly?

09:06.934 --> 09:08.567
Doesn't matter, he's ruined.

09:09.767 --> 09:12.066
One quick trip to
the stuffed animal vet

09:12.200 --> 09:14.333
and he is good as new.

09:14.467 --> 09:15.467
Hmm?

09:15.600 --> 09:18.233
(phone ringing)

09:19.600 --> 09:22.133
Hey girls, this is
Mommy's old boss.

09:22.266 --> 09:24.066
You guys run upstairs
quick, quick, quick

09:24.200 --> 09:25.633
because Daddy's going to
be here any minute, okay?

09:25.767 --> 09:26.934
You start getting ready.

09:30.934 --> 09:31.800
Hello?

09:31.934 --> 09:33.567
Beth, how are you?

09:33.700 --> 09:34.734
[Beth] I'm good.

09:34.867 --> 09:35.734
Good.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.266
Well, it's been a minute,

09:37.400 --> 09:38.467
so I thought I'd check in with
my favorite former colleague.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.633
Yeah, wow, it has.

09:40.767 --> 09:43.166
It has been a minute.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.300
How, how are you?

09:44.433 --> 09:45.567
How's the company?

09:45.700 --> 09:47.300
We're both amazing.

09:47.433 --> 09:48.900
Both very busy.

09:49.033 --> 09:51.734
Beth, does the name Anna
Bellingham ring a bell?

09:51.867 --> 09:54.900
Yeah, she's the CEO
of Regal Beauty, right?

09:55.033 --> 09:56.633
Well, we just got out
of a meeting with her

09:56.767 --> 09:59.000
and we were discussing
marketing their new beauty line.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.000
That's huge.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.633
Congratulations.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.967
It's a little early
for congratulations,

10:04.100 --> 10:06.133
which is where you come in.

10:06.266 --> 10:07.467
Okay.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.934
I thought to myself,

10:09.066 --> 10:12.166
who would be the perfect
point person for this account?

10:13.200 --> 10:14.633
The great Beth McBride.

10:14.767 --> 10:15.800
(laughs) Yeah.

10:15.934 --> 10:17.400
Maybe in my former life.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.066
Which makes you
perfect for this.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.066
Their target demo is moms
in the workforce or at home

10:22.200 --> 10:23.300
who want to look their best

10:23.433 --> 10:24.834
but don't have the
luxury of time.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.900
I'm flattered, I am.

10:27.033 --> 10:30.967
But I just, I have a lot on
my plate with the family, so.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.066
Don't you ever think
about getting back to work?

10:33.200 --> 10:36.734
Wait, are you
offering me a job?

10:36.867 --> 10:37.967
That's the plan.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.667
But first Anna wants
to see a strategy

10:39.800 --> 10:42.567
on how we would reel
in our target market.

10:42.700 --> 10:43.567
I...

10:43.700 --> 10:46.133
Thank you, but now's not great.

10:46.266 --> 10:47.166
Mull it over.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.467
I'll touch base in a day or two

10:48.600 --> 10:50.333
and you can give me
your answer then.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.967
Okay, yeah, I'll
think about it.

10:53.100 --> 10:53.967
Deal.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.567
Thanks, Corinna.

11:01.166 --> 11:02.233
[Man] I'm home!

11:02.367 --> 11:04.133
Daddy, Daddy!

11:04.266 --> 11:05.133
Hi, hi.

11:05.266 --> 11:06.133
Get in here.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.033
Oh, wow, look at you.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.300
Okay, what's happening?

11:10.433 --> 11:11.967
Melly broke Bugsy.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.233
I did not.

11:13.367 --> 11:14.633
Oh no.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.867
But looks like
she's in good hands.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.734
- Can I have one?
- Me too.

11:20.867 --> 11:21.967
Oh, okay.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.734
Those are supposed to
be for after the show.

11:24.867 --> 11:26.300
Sorry.

11:26.433 --> 11:27.967
But at least I don't have to
talk to you about cavities.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.066
Do I?

11:32.100 --> 11:34.367
Sorry.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.200
So, how was your day?

11:36.333 --> 11:38.800
Well, it was interesting.

11:38.934 --> 11:40.066
Care to elaborate?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.133
Later.

11:41.266 --> 11:42.533
All right.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.567
So, who wants to
go to the theater?

11:45.700 --> 11:46.567
- Me!
- Me!

11:46.700 --> 11:47.900
All right, let's go, let's go.

11:48.033 --> 11:49.233
Hand, hand, hand.

11:49.367 --> 11:50.233
Who's driving?

11:50.367 --> 11:51.233
You driving?

11:51.367 --> 11:52.333
Okay.

11:57.266 --> 12:00.100
Hey, should I
bring this scarf?

12:00.233 --> 12:01.600
Hannah?

12:01.734 --> 12:02.600
Hannah?

12:02.734 --> 12:04.266
Yes, yeah, sorry.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.533
Yes?

12:05.667 --> 12:06.700
Scarf, should I
bring the scarf?

12:06.834 --> 12:07.700
Sure.

12:07.834 --> 12:08.800
Yeah.

12:09.834 --> 12:10.734
The scarf.

12:10.867 --> 12:11.834
Everything all right?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.367
It's just, you know,

12:14.500 --> 12:15.934
this trip couldn't have
come at a worse time, right?

12:16.066 --> 12:17.633
I think that I bit off
more than I could chew

12:17.767 --> 12:19.133
with this account.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.533
Anything else?

12:22.667 --> 12:24.033
It's just I know

12:24.166 --> 12:26.767
that being with family can
sometimes be stressful.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.100
Well, there is that.

12:28.233 --> 12:30.867
And Beth is mad at me.

12:32.233 --> 12:33.100
Again?

12:33.233 --> 12:34.200
Yeah.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.533
Well, look, it's
only for a few days,

12:36.667 --> 12:40.567
so why don't we try and
make the best of it?

12:41.600 --> 12:42.467
Promise?

12:42.600 --> 12:43.567
I promise.

12:44.834 --> 12:46.633
As long as you promise
not to take the bait

12:46.767 --> 12:48.867
and get in another chess
battle with my dad.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.300
Trust me, I'm not
falling for that again.

12:50.433 --> 12:51.934
The man is a shark.

12:52.066 --> 12:53.033
Oh.

12:53.166 --> 12:54.600
Whoa, you okay?

12:54.734 --> 12:55.600
You look a little pale.

12:55.734 --> 12:56.600
No, I'm fine.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.700
I just skipped lunch.

12:57.834 --> 13:00.700
I'm going to pack, or repack.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.266
[Man] What'd you want
to talk to me about?

13:07.400 --> 13:09.266
I know that it's
not the best timing,

13:10.467 --> 13:12.767
but with the girls
getting older,

13:12.900 --> 13:15.333
I think I'm ready
to take on more.

13:15.467 --> 13:18.667
And I know this is something
that we've talked about before,

13:18.800 --> 13:20.767
but I've been thinking
a lot about it recently

13:20.900 --> 13:23.433
and it just, I feel like...

13:23.567 --> 13:24.600
Wow.

13:24.734 --> 13:25.667
I was not expecting this.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.266
I know the timing's not great.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.100
Oh, the timing
is never perfect.

13:29.233 --> 13:30.533
I think it's a great idea.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.433
Oh, really?

13:32.567 --> 13:34.867
Yes, yes, we can adapt.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.266
Remember when we were
planning to have Ruby,

13:36.400 --> 13:37.767
we thought two kids
would do us in.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.867
You don't think the
girls are going to feel

13:39.000 --> 13:39.867
like they're not enough?

13:40.000 --> 13:40.934
I don't want them
to feel that way.

13:41.066 --> 13:42.266
Are you kidding?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.500
They're going to be thrilled

13:43.633 --> 13:44.934
to have a younger
sister, or brother.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.867
Um...

13:52.000 --> 13:53.433
We're not talking
about the same thing.

13:53.567 --> 13:54.867
No, we're not.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.667
We're not talking about
the same thing, sorry.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.767
I...

13:59.800 --> 14:01.934
Corinna reached out to me.

14:02.066 --> 14:05.433
As in formerly the bane
of your existence Corinna?

14:05.567 --> 14:07.433
She wants me to
be the point person.

14:08.700 --> 14:11.767
And this is an
amazing opportunity.

14:11.900 --> 14:12.934
Okay.

14:13.066 --> 14:15.567
And work was a
huge part of my life.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.000
It was.

14:17.133 --> 14:20.333
And with Ruby going to
preschool, I have more time.

14:21.700 --> 14:27.900
Okay, but when we had kids,
you wanted to stay home.

14:28.033 --> 14:32.400
What made you change your mind?

14:32.533 --> 14:34.567
I...

14:34.700 --> 14:37.066
I just feel like you're the,

14:37.200 --> 14:38.066
you know, you get to go to work

14:38.200 --> 14:39.767
and you get to do what you love.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.900
and then you come home, you
get the best part of them.

14:42.033 --> 14:44.900
You get to be the fun
dad, and I'm just this,

14:45.033 --> 14:46.834
the person that says
no all the time.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.066
I need balance.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.767
[Girl] Mom!

14:50.900 --> 14:51.800
Stop it!

14:51.934 --> 14:52.900
Wait, hang on, let's
finish this conversation.

14:53.033 --> 14:53.900
I can't.

14:54.033 --> 14:55.233
I gotta break up a fight

14:55.367 --> 14:57.000
and then I gotta sew an ear
back on a stuffed animal.

14:57.133 --> 14:58.567
So just...

14:58.700 --> 15:00.066
Maybe you're just burnt out.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.500
What if tomorrow
you head back home

15:03.633 --> 15:06.066
and the girls and I
will stay back a day?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.767
Give you, I don't
know, a little break?

15:09.800 --> 15:13.834
That would be nice.

15:13.967 --> 15:18.166
Hey, girls, girls, girls.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.066
[Announcer] Flight
662 to Chicago,

15:20.200 --> 15:23.066
urging passengers to
proceed to gate B14

15:23.200 --> 15:24.300
for immediate boarding.

15:24.433 --> 15:25.900
Can I bring either of
you something to drink

15:26.033 --> 15:26.900
before your flight?

15:27.033 --> 15:28.400
Oh, champagne?

15:28.533 --> 15:30.734
I'll just have some
water, bit of a headache.

15:30.867 --> 15:32.066
Thank you.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.166
Make that two.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.400
Hey, we've got a long flight.

15:36.533 --> 15:38.467
Maybe see if you can
catch up on some sleep.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.967
Good idea.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.800
Fingers crossed we won't
encounter any screaming kids.

15:42.934 --> 15:45.600
Got my eye on a potential
troublemaker over there.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.467
Speaking of which, are you
prepared to talk babies

15:48.600 --> 15:50.967
when your mom inevitably
brings up the subject,

15:51.100 --> 15:52.166
she wants grandkids?

15:52.300 --> 15:53.400
You know, she
has Melly and Ruby

15:53.533 --> 15:55.467
and who knows, one
of these days Posy.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.133
It's not that
uncommon for couples

15:57.266 --> 15:58.734
to decide not to have kids.

16:03.367 --> 16:06.400
(boy laughs)

16:06.533 --> 16:08.467
[Announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen, flight 783

16:08.600 --> 16:11.800
to Anchorage, Alaska will begin
pre-boarding in 10 minutes.

16:11.934 --> 16:13.800
Please make your
way to the gate.

16:13.934 --> 16:14.900
I'll get those waters to go.

16:15.033 --> 16:16.000
Thanks.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.700
[Dr. Vogel] This is Dr.
Vogel returning your call.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.133
I have your test results.

16:24.266 --> 16:25.633
Please give me a call back.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.633
(indistinct)

16:34.767 --> 16:37.133
(slow music)

16:49.667 --> 16:52.800
Hannah, I had another bad
dream, can you read to me?

16:52.934 --> 16:53.867
Sure.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.967
Come on.

17:02.734 --> 17:05.700
"It was a bright
and sunny morning

17:05.834 --> 17:08.133
"and the window
stood wide open."

17:08.266 --> 17:09.300
I'm trying to sleep.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.266
Can we start at the beginning?

17:23.400 --> 17:25.599
Posy, if we keep
starting at the beginning,

17:25.733 --> 17:27.300
we'll never get to the end.

17:28.834 --> 17:34.367
Mom and Dad would start over
as many times as we wanted.

17:34.500 --> 17:37.367
I wish they were here.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.133
Me too.

17:45.166 --> 17:46.266
Okay.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.266
"There once was a
velveteen rabbit

17:48.400 --> 17:51.066
"and in the beginning
he was really splendid.

17:52.266 --> 18:02.300
"He was fat and punchy
as a rabbit should be."

18:04.367 --> 18:06.233
Hey, sorry.

18:06.367 --> 18:11.166
(shouts)

18:11.300 --> 18:14.100
Hey, sis, welcome home!

18:14.233 --> 18:16.400
Thank you.

18:16.533 --> 18:17.567
Hey!

18:17.700 --> 18:18.567
Jason, the kids,
getting their bags?

18:18.700 --> 18:19.934
Nope, just me flying solo.

18:20.066 --> 18:20.934
Wait, what?

18:21.066 --> 18:22.667
They'll be here tomorrow.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.266
I'm so confused, why
didn't you say anything?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.233
I didn't want you to worry.

18:26.367 --> 18:29.333
You know, kind of like
you're doing right now.

18:29.467 --> 18:30.333
I'm not worried.

18:30.467 --> 18:31.767
You know, it's just different.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.100
Well, Jason thought I
could use some quality time

18:34.233 --> 18:37.734
with my sisters, so he's
giving me some space.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.000
Details, please.

18:40.533 --> 18:43.834
Can we just talk
about something else?

18:43.967 --> 18:46.266
Lots of women are
mothers and have careers.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.500
Well, yeah.

18:47.633 --> 18:48.734
It's not selfish
of me to want more.

18:48.867 --> 18:50.066
Did he say you
were being selfish?

18:50.200 --> 18:51.834
No, he just can't
understand why now.

18:51.967 --> 18:54.000
I mean, I love being
a mother and a wife.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.100
I just, I want more.

18:57.233 --> 18:58.433
Yeah, okay.

18:58.567 --> 18:59.934
That's great.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.800
But yeah, why now?

19:04.934 --> 19:06.667
Talking to Corinna
woke something up in me.

19:06.800 --> 19:11.000
I mean, I miss being out
there with adults, you know,

19:11.133 --> 19:12.633
doing something that I'm good at

19:12.767 --> 19:17.233
that doesn't involve
cleaning or making lunches.

19:17.367 --> 19:18.934
I miss the hustle.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.667
And let's be honest, I mean,

19:21.800 --> 19:22.967
the girls are gonna
grow up, right?

19:23.100 --> 19:23.967
And they're going to
be out of the house

19:24.100 --> 19:25.467
and then who's going to hire me?

19:25.600 --> 19:28.066
I mean, an 18 year gap tends
to stick out on a resume.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.567
I mean, I'd be un-hireable.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.066
I think you're getting
ahead of yourself here.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.500
And in Jason's defense,
change is hard.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.400
Maybe he just likes
things the way they are.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.900
Yeah, but he didn't
seem to have a problem

19:40.033 --> 19:41.066
when he thought it was
about having another baby.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.300
He said "We'll
adjust, you know."

19:42.433 --> 19:43.500
Wait, you want another baby?

19:43.633 --> 19:45.066
No, that's not about
having another baby.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.066
Oh, because you
mentioned a baby.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.100
No.

19:47.233 --> 19:48.233
Wait, are we having one

19:48.367 --> 19:49.734
of those I should just
listen conversations

19:49.867 --> 19:52.333
or you want my
help conversations?

19:54.367 --> 19:55.333
Both.

19:55.467 --> 19:56.500
Okay.

19:58.033 --> 20:01.333
Well, to be honest,
I'm pretty surprised

20:01.467 --> 20:03.233
that you're even thinking about
working with Corinna again.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.166
I mean, you couldn't get
away from her fast enough.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.567
People change.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.000
Everybody gets to do
what they want in life.

20:09.133 --> 20:10.633
I mean, you get to spend
time in the mountains

20:10.767 --> 20:12.133
and you'll have the cafe.

20:12.266 --> 20:16.133
And Hannah, you know, she
leads her jet-setting life.

20:16.266 --> 20:17.567
And then there's me.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.567
You shouldn't compare
yourself to others, you know.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.100
Things aren't always
as simple as they seem.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.166
I'm just...

20:28.300 --> 20:29.567
I'm happy to be home.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.800
I'm excited to see Mom and Dad.

20:30.934 --> 20:33.000
They are so happy you're here.

20:37.533 --> 20:41.967
Does she ever talk
about it, the accident?

20:42.100 --> 20:44.233
No.

20:44.367 --> 20:45.967
Talking about the accident is...

20:46.100 --> 20:48.333
It's not really our
family's strong suit.

20:49.867 --> 20:50.967
What an awful thing

20:51.100 --> 20:53.233
to be reminded of
every single birthday.

20:56.767 --> 20:58.633
I think this is the
first time in five years

20:58.767 --> 21:02.200
that you, me, and Hannah have
been home at the same time.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.900
Should be interesting.

21:04.033 --> 21:06.633
(laughs)

21:06.767 --> 21:08.400
Really interesting.

21:11.333 --> 21:15.133
(car honks)

21:15.266 --> 21:17.033
Oh, there they are!

21:17.166 --> 21:18.700
Welcome home, honey.

21:18.834 --> 21:22.867
Oh, oh, sweetheart.
- Good to see you.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.400
Good to see you.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.400
Hello, kid.

21:25.533 --> 21:26.500
Dad.

21:28.767 --> 21:31.066
Oh, I'm so happy to be home.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.567
We've been counting the days.

21:32.700 --> 21:33.800
Yeah.

21:33.934 --> 21:35.533
Wait, where's
Jason, the girls?

21:35.667 --> 21:37.200
Oh, slight change of plans.

21:37.333 --> 21:38.467
They'll be coming tomorrow.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.467
Oh, well, we'll just
get your bags inside.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.300
We set up your old room for you.

21:42.433 --> 21:43.467
Thanks, Dad.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.467
So you must be exhausted.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.734
Do you need a hot
shower or a warm cookie?

21:48.867 --> 21:49.734
Both.

21:49.867 --> 21:51.066
(laughs) That's my girl.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.200
Posy, can you show your
sister to her room?

21:54.333 --> 21:56.133
I think she knows
which room, Mom.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.900
This brings me back.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.200
Did I ever tell you how
much I miss your cooking?

22:02.333 --> 22:04.867
Well, I miss
cooking for you more.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.433
You spoil us.

22:06.567 --> 22:09.367
Sometimes I get jealous that
Posy gets to live next door.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.033
Seriously, I wish I was
half the cook you were.

22:11.166 --> 22:13.934
I think Jason and the
girls definitely agree.

22:14.066 --> 22:14.967
Oh, come on.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.133
I'm sure you're great.

22:16.266 --> 22:17.367
No.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.867
Well, all it
takes is practice.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.033
Posy here used to want
nothing to do with baking

22:21.166 --> 22:23.300
and she's turning
into a real pro.

22:23.433 --> 22:25.100
Oh.

22:25.233 --> 22:26.533
That's quite a casserole.

22:26.667 --> 22:27.767
Yeah.

22:27.900 --> 22:28.967
Well, Hannah and Adam
will be here soon

22:29.100 --> 22:31.600
and I wanted to take
some to Luke too.

22:31.734 --> 22:33.033
Who's Luke?

22:33.166 --> 22:34.633
He's been renting the guest
house the past few weeks.

22:34.767 --> 22:36.300
He's a travel writer.

22:36.433 --> 22:37.633
Oh, speak of the devil.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.600
Hey.

22:41.734 --> 22:44.367
Okay.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.867
You didn't want to tell me

22:46.000 --> 22:48.433
that there was a cute writer
living on the property?

22:48.567 --> 22:49.433
It never occurred to me.

22:49.567 --> 22:50.800
Uh huh.

22:50.934 --> 22:54.033
And he is a very
nice young man.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.300
In fact, he is
writing a travel guide

22:56.433 --> 22:57.867
about the great peaks
of North America.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.967
All of which I hope
to summit one day.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.834
Actually, Mom,

23:02.967 --> 23:06.333
why don't you let Posy and
I run this over to him?

23:06.467 --> 23:08.266
- Yeah.
- I would like to meet Luke.

23:09.900 --> 23:14.166
(sighs)

23:14.300 --> 23:16.600
You think this is funny.

23:16.734 --> 23:18.934
(knocking)

23:22.567 --> 23:24.667
What a nice surprise.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.767
I hope we're
not bothering you.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.033
You're not bothering me.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.266
Mom whipped up one
of her specialties.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.266
Have you eaten?

23:29.400 --> 23:30.367
No.

23:31.900 --> 23:34.033
Oh, this is my
nosy sister, Beth.

23:34.166 --> 23:35.433
I've heard a lot about you.

23:35.567 --> 23:38.166
New Jersey, married, two kids.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.100
That about sums it up.

23:40.233 --> 23:42.133
I have heard a
lot about you too.

23:42.266 --> 23:43.133
Really?

23:43.266 --> 23:44.133
Yeah, Mom filled her in.

23:44.266 --> 23:45.600
Oh.

23:45.734 --> 23:46.600
You guys want to come in?

23:46.734 --> 23:47.600
We would love to.

23:47.734 --> 23:48.834
Except that we can't

23:48.967 --> 23:50.300
because our other sister
is arriving any second.

23:50.433 --> 23:51.333
That'd be Hannah, right?

23:51.467 --> 23:53.166
- Yeah.
- That's right.

23:53.300 --> 23:56.333
So how long will you be in town?

23:56.467 --> 23:58.333
I'm not really sure.

23:58.467 --> 24:00.233
I've got a few climbs I
want to get under my belt

24:00.367 --> 24:02.066
and a few sights I'd like to see

24:02.200 --> 24:03.934
before I head back
home to Chicago.

24:05.467 --> 24:07.567
He should come to the
Lumberjack Games with us.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.000
We're going to the
Lumberjack Games?

24:09.133 --> 24:11.233
Yeah, it's a family tradition.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.433
Okay, well, I'm sure
Luke has work to do.

24:13.567 --> 24:15.400
Actually, one thing you
should know about writers is

24:15.533 --> 24:18.166
we do just about anything
to avoid writing.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.900
(laughs)

24:20.033 --> 24:22.100
Well, it's a plan.

24:22.233 --> 24:24.333
All right, I
look forward to it.

24:24.467 --> 24:25.667
Tell your mom
thanks for the food.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.066
I will.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.200
Bye, Luke.

24:30.300 --> 24:31.600
Family tradition?

24:31.734 --> 24:33.667
Okay, I might've
gotten carried away,

24:33.800 --> 24:35.834
but I feel bad,
he's all by himself.

24:35.967 --> 24:38.166
You're just like Mom,
always playing matchmaker.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.400
[Hannah] Posy!

24:39.533 --> 24:40.567
- Hey!
- Hey!

24:40.700 --> 24:41.700
Hi!

24:43.867 --> 24:45.166
So good to see you.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.233
Hey.

24:46.367 --> 24:47.367
Beth.

24:48.967 --> 24:50.000
How was the flight?

24:50.133 --> 24:51.166
Oh, it was great.

24:51.300 --> 24:53.567
Except for the kid that
was kicking my seat.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.667
Oh, it wasn't that bad.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.400
He was just being a typical kid.

24:56.533 --> 24:58.567
[Stewart] Here's
the weary travelers!

24:58.700 --> 25:00.400
Oh, you made it!

25:00.533 --> 25:02.400
I'm so glad to see you.

25:02.533 --> 25:05.233
Hey, Adam, welcome.
- Welcome home.

25:05.367 --> 25:07.233
Okay, let's get inside

25:07.367 --> 25:08.433
and we are going to
go make some tea.

25:08.567 --> 25:09.567
Come on, girls.

25:10.867 --> 25:12.233
You have anything stronger?

25:12.367 --> 25:15.400
I may have a single malt
scotch around here somewhere.

25:15.533 --> 25:16.500
Follow me.

25:18.867 --> 25:20.000
(gasps) These are delicious.

25:20.133 --> 25:21.834
I am definitely quitting
my diet while I'm here.

25:21.967 --> 25:22.967
Mom, I love your food.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.400
Mom, sit down, relax.

25:25.533 --> 25:28.900
Oh, it's just so good to
have all my girls here again.

25:29.033 --> 25:31.233
It's a miracle we could do
it with your busy schedules.

25:31.367 --> 25:34.467
Did you really think we'd
miss your 60th birthday?

25:34.600 --> 25:36.633
Okay, note to everyone.

25:36.767 --> 25:39.233
No need to keep
reiterating it's my 60th.

25:39.367 --> 25:41.166
Just say plain old birthday.

25:42.433 --> 25:43.800
How are things at the cafe?

25:43.934 --> 25:46.567
Oh, Posy here has just
really taken over the reins.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.800
She's a natural.

25:47.934 --> 25:49.400
It's almost like Stewart
and I don't even need

25:49.533 --> 25:50.567
to be there anymore.

25:50.700 --> 25:52.233
It gives us such
peace of mind knowing

25:52.367 --> 25:55.900
that it is going to be in
safe hands when we retire.

25:56.033 --> 25:57.967
Well, speaking of retiring,

25:58.100 --> 25:58.967
I think I'm going to go to bed.

25:59.100 --> 25:59.967
No?

26:00.166 --> 26:01.300
Yeah, me too.

26:01.433 --> 26:03.367
I'll be up just as soon
as I beat your dad here.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.066
I have him cornered.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.400
Checkmate.

26:11.533 --> 26:12.400
(laughs)

26:12.533 --> 26:14.133
- Seriously?
- Every time.

26:14.266 --> 26:15.133
Don't be too hard on yourself.

26:15.266 --> 26:16.367
You've had a long flight.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.233
We'll play again when
you're not so tired.

26:18.367 --> 26:19.300
Dad, you're making it worse.

26:19.433 --> 26:20.800
Well, I...

26:20.934 --> 26:21.800
Next time, sweetie.

26:21.934 --> 26:23.200
Let's go.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.633
Live to fight another day.

26:24.767 --> 26:26.033
- Yeah, good night.
- See everybody tomorrow.

26:26.166 --> 26:27.333
- Night.
- Nighty night.

26:28.600 --> 26:32.533
You know, I think I
will turn in as well.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.033
I'm going to give Jason
and the kids a call

26:34.166 --> 26:35.467
before I read a book

26:35.600 --> 26:39.700
and drift off to a peaceful
uninterrupted slumber.

26:39.834 --> 26:40.867
I'll help you up.

26:41.000 --> 26:41.967
I'm fine.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.367
Sure, yeah.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.033
That'd be great.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.200
- Night, Mom, Dad.
- Night, girls.

26:49.333 --> 26:50.900
Good night, girls.

26:51.033 --> 26:53.066
Just the thought of
working at the cafe

26:53.200 --> 26:56.567
for the rest of my life
scares me to death.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.233
I want to travel,
I want adventure.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.734
I want to climb new peaks.

26:59.867 --> 27:02.600
I know, but it's beautiful
here and the people are nice.

27:02.734 --> 27:05.367
And Mom and Dad have
done so much for us.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.734
I mean, it's their dream to
keep the cafe in the family.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.767
What is this?

27:19.900 --> 27:21.600
I don't think I've
ever seen this before.

27:21.734 --> 27:22.767
Me either.

27:22.900 --> 27:25.300
I can't believe we
still have a VHS player.

27:27.834 --> 27:33.433
It must've been Hannah's.

27:33.567 --> 27:35.767
I think that about does it.

27:35.900 --> 27:36.800
Let's go.

27:36.934 --> 27:37.900
Girls.

27:39.867 --> 27:40.767
What do you think, girls?

27:40.900 --> 27:41.867
You excited?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.266
Your first overnight
hiking trip.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.800
Isn't it gonna be freezing?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.200
I'm starving.

27:49.333 --> 27:52.800
I need to go to the bathroom.

27:52.934 --> 27:56.633
As you can tell,
they're all very excited.

27:56.767 --> 27:58.867
Mom sure was beautiful.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.166
Yeah.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.166
She sure was.

28:03.300 --> 28:06.033
No colds, no one gets
colds on this trip.

28:07.233 --> 28:10.000
[Beth] The same age
as Melly and Ruby now.

28:10.133 --> 28:11.100
Yeah.

28:13.233 --> 28:17.000
Sometimes I do wonder how
different life would be

28:17.133 --> 28:18.934
if Mom and Dad were alive.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.600
Me too.

28:24.734 --> 28:26.433
I also think about what
it would've been like

28:26.567 --> 28:28.767
if Suzanne and Stewart
hadn't taken us in.

28:33.166 --> 28:35.367
Yeah.

28:43.433 --> 28:46.300
(phone ringing)

28:53.333 --> 28:57.066
[Beth] So much
for sleeping in.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.133
Sorry, I know
it's early for you,

28:59.266 --> 29:01.300
but I'm just dying
to get your answer.

29:01.433 --> 29:02.400
Corinna.

29:04.166 --> 29:05.533
Jason and I talked

29:05.667 --> 29:09.066
and we just don't think
it's the right time for us.

29:10.734 --> 29:12.934
I think that's
a mistake, Beth.

29:13.066 --> 29:14.967
This is a golden opportunity.

29:16.233 --> 29:19.266
Believe me, I know,

29:19.400 --> 29:24.033
but I'm going to have to pass.

29:24.166 --> 29:28.300
I appreciate you thinking
of me for this though.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.433
Good morning.

29:34.567 --> 29:36.600
Hey, there's coffee
if you want some.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.033
Where is everyone?

29:38.166 --> 29:39.600
Oh, Mom and Dad
are at the cafe,

29:39.734 --> 29:42.233
Adam went into town, and
not sure where Hannah is.

29:42.367 --> 29:43.367
(laughs) Funny.

29:44.567 --> 29:46.867
So what's on the
agenda for today?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.133
I'm actually going
to go into town too.

29:48.266 --> 29:49.333
I wanted to get a few
extra little things

29:49.467 --> 29:50.333
for Mom's birthday.

29:50.467 --> 29:51.367
You want to join?

29:51.500 --> 29:52.367
Sure.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.467
I'd love to.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.133
- Great.
- Hannah, you want to come?

29:56.500 --> 29:57.533
I would really love to,

29:57.667 --> 29:59.033
but I have to get
through this proposal.

29:59.166 --> 30:00.934
I'll catch up with
you guys later.

30:01.066 --> 30:01.934
And miss a day out
with your sisters?

30:02.066 --> 30:02.934
Don't make me feel bad.

30:03.066 --> 30:04.033
I didn't say anything.

30:04.166 --> 30:05.600
You don't have to.

30:05.734 --> 30:07.100
So just you and me then.

30:07.233 --> 30:08.266
Yeah, guess so.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.033
Have fun.

30:10.166 --> 30:12.633
We will.

30:19.667 --> 30:23.467
Hey, Beth, how about this?

30:23.600 --> 30:26.367
No.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.600
Pretty sure she would hate that.

30:28.734 --> 30:29.700
Oh well.

30:31.233 --> 30:32.100
[Beth] Luke!

30:32.233 --> 30:33.133
Hi.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.767
Posy, look, it's Luke.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.266
Yeah, I can see that.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.533
I saw you guys through the
window, I wanted to say hi.

30:38.667 --> 30:39.600
What are you up to?

30:39.734 --> 30:40.867
Oh, we're trying to find
a little extra something

30:41.000 --> 30:41.934
for Mom's birthday.

30:42.066 --> 30:43.200
How about you?

30:43.333 --> 30:44.600
I was going to go to Keystone
Canyon, get some climbs in.

30:44.734 --> 30:46.300
I hear there's some beautiful
waterfalls up there.

30:46.433 --> 30:49.367
Oh yeah, some of my favorite
routes are up that way.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.700
Why don't you guys come?

30:50.834 --> 30:55.300
Oh, that's more Posy's domain.

30:55.433 --> 30:56.600
You should go.

30:56.734 --> 30:57.767
Oh, we just got here.

30:57.900 --> 30:58.767
Yeah.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.266
Go, I can keep looking.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.667
And leave you all alone?

31:01.800 --> 31:04.166
Oh, you say that
like it's a bad thing.

31:04.300 --> 31:05.700
Jason arrives with
the kids today,

31:05.834 --> 31:09.600
so this might be the only,
you know, me time I get.

31:09.734 --> 31:11.767
(laughs) What do you say?

31:11.900 --> 31:13.367
Yeah, yeah, I'd love to.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.500
Great.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.767
Bye, Beth.
- Bye, Beth.

31:18.900 --> 31:24.533
(calm music)

31:24.667 --> 31:25.667
This is beautiful.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.200
[Luke] Yeah, this is home.

31:28.767 --> 31:30.867
Aren't you so lucky you got
Denali right in your backyard?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.667
Yeah, but you get to
climb all over the world.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.934
What's been your
favorite so far?

31:35.066 --> 31:36.100
Matterhorn.

31:36.233 --> 31:37.333
I mean, it's not the tallest,

31:37.467 --> 31:38.834
but it's definitely a challenge.

31:38.967 --> 31:40.767
Yeah, man, I would love
to climb in Switzerland

31:40.900 --> 31:42.500
or, gosh, anywhere in Europe.

31:42.633 --> 31:45.333
Well, someone of your
skills, you definitely should.

31:45.467 --> 31:47.533
Yeah, I was thinking about
going back there this summer.

31:47.667 --> 31:51.600
Could use a companion,
like a climbing companion.

31:51.734 --> 31:54.300
Oh, I'd love to, but work.

32:03.300 --> 32:04.400
I mean, your parents
would understand

32:04.533 --> 32:06.066
a little climbing excursion.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.567
My dad maybe, but my mom,

32:07.700 --> 32:09.266
I think she'd rather
I took up something

32:09.400 --> 32:12.834
a little less dangerous,
like scrapbooking.

32:12.967 --> 32:14.900
(laughs) Over-protective, huh?

32:15.033 --> 32:16.000
Yeah.

32:16.133 --> 32:17.166
But I can understand.

32:19.700 --> 32:22.233
My birth parents and
one other couple,

32:22.367 --> 32:26.333
they were killed in an
avalanche on Denali years ago.

32:27.367 --> 32:31.066
I was four years
old at the time.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.600
Sorry, Posy.

32:32.734 --> 32:34.934
That's an impossible
situation to deal with.

32:36.367 --> 32:42.900
We're still dealing with
it, each in our own way.

32:43.033 --> 32:44.500
Posy, I...

32:44.633 --> 32:46.400
Oh gosh, I don't
mean to bring you down.

32:46.533 --> 32:48.667
No, what I want to say-

32:48.800 --> 32:50.000
Oh, you don't have to
say anything, really.

32:50.133 --> 32:51.233
It's a lot to lay on someone.

32:51.367 --> 32:53.600
Most people don't know
how to react, it's fine.

32:53.734 --> 32:55.600
We came here to hike,
let's get to it.

33:03.934 --> 33:05.467
Well, I think they
are great together.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.133
Well, they do have
a lot in common.

33:08.266 --> 33:10.333
I say we stay out
of her business.

33:10.467 --> 33:11.567
Oh, come on.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.567
You guys realize I'm
standing right here?

33:13.700 --> 33:14.633
And I agree with Hannah.

33:14.767 --> 33:15.834
Thank you.

33:15.967 --> 33:17.633
We just want you
to be happy, honey.

33:17.767 --> 33:18.834
Grandma, we made it!

33:18.967 --> 33:20.667
Oh, there's my
two favorite girls!

33:22.100 --> 33:23.066
I missed you guys.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.500
My turn.

33:24.633 --> 33:25.500
Auntie Posy!

33:25.633 --> 33:26.967
We almost missed our plane.

33:27.100 --> 33:30.233
Well, I'm glad you didn't
because I missed you.

33:30.367 --> 33:31.333
Come here.

33:31.467 --> 33:34.233
- Mommy!
- Where is your Daddy?

33:34.367 --> 33:36.400
(laughs)

33:36.533 --> 33:37.767
Freezing out there.

33:37.900 --> 33:38.767
Oh.

33:38.900 --> 33:39.900
[Beth] Wow.

33:41.133 --> 33:42.133
I kind of didn't
know what to pack,

33:42.266 --> 33:43.667
so I kind of packed everything.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.500
Yeah, good man.

33:45.633 --> 33:47.834
So, who is hungry?

33:47.967 --> 33:49.500
We had pretzels, two cookies,

33:49.633 --> 33:50.800
and a candy bar on the plane.

33:50.934 --> 33:52.333
Traitor.

33:52.467 --> 33:53.900
(laughs) Well, let's get
your coats off at least.

33:54.033 --> 33:54.900
Come on.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.233
I'm glad you're here.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.333
Me too.

33:57.467 --> 33:58.800
How was your flight?

33:58.934 --> 34:00.867
Well, we were a little slow
getting out of the house,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.066
but we made it.

34:03.533 --> 34:06.900
That reminds me, actually,
not all of us made it.

34:07.033 --> 34:08.699
Daddy lost Bugsy.

34:08.833 --> 34:10.132
- Oh no!
- Daddy lost Bugsy.

34:10.266 --> 34:11.132
What?

34:11.266 --> 34:12.533
Yeah, Daddy lost Bugsy.

34:12.667 --> 34:13.699
Well, sweetie, he
might be on the airplane.

34:13.833 --> 34:14.699
I'll call the airline.

34:14.833 --> 34:15.800
Hey, girls, you know what?

34:15.934 --> 34:16.800
I didn't get my hug.

34:16.934 --> 34:18.367
Who wants to hug Auntie Hannah?

34:18.500 --> 34:19.699
Aunt Hannah!

34:19.833 --> 34:20.800
Hi, sweetheart.

34:22.433 --> 34:23.867
Hello, you two.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.467
It's so good to
see you girls again.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.199
Think we'll ever
see Bugsy again?

34:27.333 --> 34:28.533
'Course you will.

34:28.667 --> 34:29.667
(phone rings)
Oh.

34:31.667 --> 34:33.033
I gotta get this.

34:33.166 --> 34:34.132
Be right back.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.233
Well, are you sure you're sure?

34:37.367 --> 34:38.699
[Dr. Vogel] 100% (indistinct).

34:38.833 --> 34:41.467
Congratulations, Hannah,
you're going to be a mother.

34:54.699 --> 35:01.066
(girls laughing)

35:01.200 --> 35:05.467
Oh, look!

35:05.600 --> 35:06.867
[Posy] Hey, Socks.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Wow.

35:09.266 --> 35:11.467
Can we ride her, Mommy?

35:11.600 --> 35:12.900
Not right now.

35:13.033 --> 35:15.000
I can walk 'em
around really slowly.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.734
Maybe when you're
a little bit older.

35:17.867 --> 35:20.133
But last year, you said
wait until next year.

35:20.266 --> 35:21.467
It's already next year.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.633
I've got helmets.

35:22.767 --> 35:24.900
You know what, I'm
going to have to say no.

35:26.266 --> 35:27.967
Hey, you know what?

35:28.100 --> 35:30.633
I bet you he would love it
if you gave him a brush.

35:30.767 --> 35:33.633
Oh, that's a good idea.

35:33.767 --> 35:35.333
A brush.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.300
It's pretty safe, you know.

35:40.433 --> 35:42.000
I'd make sure they didn't fall.

35:43.533 --> 35:46.467
Why chance it?

35:46.600 --> 35:47.834
He's got a perfect record.

35:47.967 --> 35:49.300
Not one accident.

35:49.433 --> 35:51.467
I don't think anybody
plans on getting hurt, Posy.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.166
That's why they
call it an accident.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.467
Come on, you don't
want them growing up

35:55.600 --> 35:57.400
being afraid of everything.

35:57.533 --> 35:59.834
Not everybody's a daredevil.

35:59.967 --> 36:01.633
Our parents were.

36:01.767 --> 36:04.800
Yep, and look what
happened to them.

36:07.834 --> 36:10.533
You know, Mom worries about
you when you go climbing.

36:10.667 --> 36:12.867
What, am I supposed to
stop doing what I love

36:13.000 --> 36:14.467
just because it makes
someone nervous?

36:14.600 --> 36:16.233
Well, it's not just someone.

36:17.667 --> 36:19.633
It must be nice to
have your freedom.

36:19.767 --> 36:21.300
What freedom?

36:21.433 --> 36:24.533
I have my entire future
mapped out for me.

36:24.667 --> 36:26.533
You and Hannah get to live
the lives that you want

36:26.667 --> 36:28.800
while I'm stuck here,
working at the cafe.

36:28.934 --> 36:31.300
You don't think Mom
and Dad felt stuck?

36:31.433 --> 36:32.467
Do you think their plans

36:32.600 --> 36:35.300
involved raising
three little girls?

36:35.433 --> 36:37.500
Sometimes you have
to make sacrifices.

36:39.934 --> 36:44.200
We all do.

36:44.333 --> 36:45.734
Good job, girls.

36:45.867 --> 36:47.233
Nice and gentle.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.033
(laughs) What is that?

36:53.166 --> 36:54.033
That's a snowman.

36:54.166 --> 36:56.133
I thought it was a turtle.

36:56.266 --> 36:57.700
Is he making fun of Pudgy?

36:57.834 --> 36:59.900
You named your snowman Pudgy?

37:00.100 --> 37:01.967
Well, it's definitely accurate.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.200
Gosh, I remember this
like it was yesterday.

37:04.333 --> 37:05.400
- Let's see.
- Look.

37:08.233 --> 37:10.767
These girls were best friends.

37:10.900 --> 37:14.433
Oh, it's my favorite
picture of you girls.

37:14.567 --> 37:17.133
Look, they are at
the fairy creek.

37:17.266 --> 37:18.934
They have fairies here?

37:19.066 --> 37:20.400
Oh, yes.

37:20.533 --> 37:22.967
You can't come all the way
here and not go to fairy creek.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.033
Can we go?

37:24.166 --> 37:26.300
Please, please, please?
- Please?

37:27.567 --> 37:28.700
Sure.

37:28.834 --> 37:31.300
But Auntie Posy would
have to be the guide.

37:31.433 --> 37:33.800
I don't think I would
remember how to get there.

37:34.834 --> 37:35.934
I would love to.

37:36.066 --> 37:37.600
Thanks.

37:37.734 --> 37:39.700
Dad's promised Paul
Bunyan over here

37:39.834 --> 37:41.200
that we would go to
the Lumberjack Games,

37:41.333 --> 37:42.767
so we're in for that.

37:42.900 --> 37:43.934
Oh yeah, we're in for that.

37:44.066 --> 37:46.400
And I gotta be honest,
I'm very excited.

37:47.467 --> 37:49.800
Adam, you in, buddy?

37:49.934 --> 37:51.100
Sounds good to me.

37:51.233 --> 37:52.233
Hannah?

37:54.500 --> 37:55.934
Where's Hannah?

37:56.066 --> 37:57.033
I'll be back.

37:59.834 --> 38:03.500
Look at this blue hair.

38:03.633 --> 38:05.834
Hey.

38:05.967 --> 38:06.934
Everything all right?

38:07.066 --> 38:08.834
Yeah, I'm great.

38:08.967 --> 38:10.100
Why don't you come join us?

38:10.233 --> 38:11.600
Posy and Luke are going
through old photo albums

38:11.734 --> 38:14.600
and I think I'm close to
checkmating your dad, so...

38:14.734 --> 38:15.967
I'll be in, in a minute.

38:18.300 --> 38:20.100
Okay, what is it?

38:20.233 --> 38:21.934
It's just...

38:22.066 --> 38:24.367
It's just a headache really.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.467
No big deal.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.834
I just...

38:27.967 --> 38:31.934
You have working too hard.

38:32.066 --> 38:33.867
It's supposed to be
a time to unwind.

38:34.967 --> 38:36.000
Yeah.

38:36.133 --> 38:37.200
Okay, listen, I have an idea.

38:37.333 --> 38:40.867
What if, after I wrap
up this next case,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.500
you and I go on a real vacation?

38:43.633 --> 38:44.500
I don't know.

38:44.633 --> 38:45.700
Hear me out, hear me out.

38:45.834 --> 38:47.700
We'll go somewhere secluded.

38:47.834 --> 38:48.800
No kids.

38:50.900 --> 38:55.934
A small island, just you,
me, and endless margaritas.

38:56.066 --> 39:00.400
I don't think a vacation
is in our immediate future.

39:00.533 --> 39:04.333
Why?

39:04.467 --> 39:05.500
Adam, I-

39:05.633 --> 39:06.600
We're going to start charades.

39:06.734 --> 39:08.000
Do you guys want to play?

39:09.033 --> 39:10.767
Count us in, yes please.

39:10.900 --> 39:13.066
I can definitely beat
your dad at charades.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.133
(laughs)

39:15.266 --> 39:16.266
Okay.

39:18.633 --> 39:19.567
Sorry, I cut you off.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.400
What were you going to say?

39:21.533 --> 39:22.500
Um.

39:24.233 --> 39:25.834
I was just going to remind you

39:25.967 --> 39:28.567
not to get so
competitive with my dad.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.667
Charades.

39:34.867 --> 39:36.834
[Answering Machine]
First new message.

39:36.967 --> 39:38.834
[Corinna] Hi, Beth,
it's Corinna again.

39:38.967 --> 39:40.066
Look, I know you're busy,

39:40.200 --> 39:41.834
but I emailed you
the brief anyways.

39:41.967 --> 39:43.266
Just look at it.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.900
You don't want to look
back years from now

39:45.033 --> 39:46.734
and regret not doing this.

39:46.867 --> 39:47.834
Call me.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.000
[Man] Beth, we're
starting charades!

39:51.133 --> 39:52.100
Coming.

40:00.967 --> 40:02.567
This is where
real fairies live?

40:02.700 --> 40:04.066
That's right,

40:04.200 --> 40:06.400
but they only come out when
there's no people around.

40:06.533 --> 40:08.233
Do they have magic powers?

40:08.367 --> 40:09.433
Oh, absolutely.

40:09.567 --> 40:11.834
In fact, if you can find
a little round stone,

40:11.967 --> 40:13.333
make a wish, toss
it in the water,

40:13.467 --> 40:15.100
and your wish will come true.

40:16.467 --> 40:17.834
What'd you find?

40:17.967 --> 40:19.734
Can I wish for
Bugsy to come home?

40:19.867 --> 40:21.233
I don't see why not.

40:21.367 --> 40:23.066
Let's get you one too.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.500
Okay, now I'm going to take
you girls to the wishing spot.

40:25.633 --> 40:26.834
Oh yeah, okay.

40:26.967 --> 40:28.333
They come right over here.

40:29.467 --> 40:31.000
Okay, close your
eyes and make a wish

40:31.133 --> 40:32.367
and throw it in the water.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.667
That's so good!

40:35.800 --> 40:37.500
It's gonna come true, good job!

40:37.633 --> 40:38.734
My wish, Mom, I made a wish!

40:38.867 --> 40:40.400
Good job, sweetie.

40:40.533 --> 40:42.934
Well, here we are
on the magical bridge!

40:43.066 --> 40:44.333
Here we are.

40:44.467 --> 40:45.900
It seems way bigger back then.

40:46.033 --> 40:48.400
Yeah, well, we were just kids.

40:48.533 --> 40:49.567
Hey, you know what?

40:49.700 --> 40:51.066
We should recreate that photo.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.567
Oh, that's a great idea.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.567
I'll take it.

40:53.700 --> 40:54.567
Posy, give me your phone.

40:54.700 --> 40:56.600
Yours is way newer than mine.

40:56.734 --> 40:58.233
Now take a seat,
Hannah in the middle.

40:58.367 --> 41:00.633
Oh, we don't have to
actually sit on the ground.

41:00.767 --> 41:01.800
I think you'll live.

41:01.934 --> 41:02.800
Do we really have
to sit on the ground?

41:02.934 --> 41:03.800
You're so pushy, come on.

41:03.934 --> 41:05.333
Squeeze in close.

41:05.467 --> 41:08.000
I just don't understand
why you have to do that.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.300
Why I have to do what?

41:09.433 --> 41:10.500
Tell her to make
a wish for Bugsy.

41:10.633 --> 41:12.233
Now she's going to
be disappointed.

41:12.367 --> 41:13.967
Look on the bright side, at
least your daughter's going-

41:14.100 --> 41:14.967
Girls!

41:15.100 --> 41:16.300
Hey, can we not do this now?

41:16.433 --> 41:17.834
Big smiles.

41:17.967 --> 41:20.500
Hannah, I think your arms
were around your sisters.

41:21.767 --> 41:25.934
Hold on.

41:26.066 --> 41:30.367
(camera clicks)

41:36.400 --> 41:38.367
Beth.
- Oh, oh!

41:38.500 --> 41:40.333
Sorry.

41:40.467 --> 41:41.834
You startled me.

41:41.967 --> 41:42.834
I didn't mean
to interrupt you.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.000
We are leaving in five minutes.

41:44.133 --> 41:45.100
Okay.

41:58.166 --> 42:00.734
(upbeat music)

42:00.867 --> 42:03.700
(crowd chattering)

42:05.200 --> 42:12.000
(thuds)

42:12.133 --> 42:16.233
On your marks, get set!

42:16.367 --> 42:17.667
What are they doing, Grandpa?

42:17.800 --> 42:19.834
Well, this is the cross
cut saw competition.

42:19.967 --> 42:21.266
The teams are racing each other

42:21.400 --> 42:23.867
to see who can cut through
the logs the fastest.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.734
(audience applauds)

42:27.867 --> 42:29.233
I want to show Luke
the wood carving.

42:29.367 --> 42:32.000
I want to try my hand at
a little speed chopping.

42:32.133 --> 42:33.166
What?

42:33.300 --> 42:34.166
Well, there's a
lot to see here,

42:34.300 --> 42:35.667
so why don't we just split up

42:35.800 --> 42:37.266
and meet over the hot saw
competition in about an hour?

42:37.400 --> 42:39.300
And we'll take Melly and
Ruby over to the kids area.

42:39.433 --> 42:40.300
How about that?

42:40.433 --> 42:41.300
Good?

42:41.433 --> 42:42.300
Let's go.

42:42.433 --> 42:43.400
We'll go this way.

42:45.533 --> 42:46.667
Thanks for coming along.

42:46.800 --> 42:47.934
I'm sure you'd much
rather be climbing.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.266
No way, miss this?

42:49.400 --> 42:50.767
I love this stuff.

42:52.066 --> 42:54.667
Plus, there's always
time to go climbing.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.433
Oh, you are leaving next week.

42:58.867 --> 43:04.233
Unless of course you
want to extend your trip?

43:04.367 --> 43:07.166
Is that an invitation?

43:07.300 --> 43:13.467
Maybe.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.734
What do you think
about Luke and Posy?

43:15.867 --> 43:16.967
They seem pretty
good together,

43:17.100 --> 43:18.433
from what little I've seen.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.133
They both love climbing.

43:22.266 --> 43:25.233
Shared interests
are always good.

43:25.367 --> 43:26.233
Thank you.

43:26.367 --> 43:27.834
They're both adrenaline junkies.

43:28.967 --> 43:31.567
You used to be a bit like that.

43:31.700 --> 43:33.400
I think you're talking
about someone else.

43:33.533 --> 43:34.900
Oh, come on.

43:35.033 --> 43:36.400
When we first met, you were
into all sorts of things.

43:36.533 --> 43:38.467
It was you that talked me
into going cliff jumping

43:38.600 --> 43:40.400
at the lake that summer.

43:40.533 --> 43:42.400
I blame you for my
fear of heights.

43:43.934 --> 43:45.333
(laughs) I was a
different person back then.

43:45.467 --> 43:48.133
You know, I guess there was
things that used to scare me

43:48.266 --> 43:49.600
that don't anymore.

43:49.734 --> 43:51.567
And then there are things
that I thought would scare me,

43:51.700 --> 43:53.467
maybe to the point that I
never wanted to do them,

43:53.600 --> 43:55.667
and I think now maybe
I would like to.

43:57.433 --> 44:01.533
Okay, you lost me a little
bit back there, but...

44:01.667 --> 44:05.200
But whichever Hannah this is

44:05.333 --> 44:10.133
and whatever scary thing you
want to do or not do, I'm in.

44:12.500 --> 44:14.233
Thank you.

44:14.367 --> 44:17.800
Cheers.

44:17.934 --> 44:21.033
(smacks)

44:21.166 --> 44:23.033
(saws buzzing)

44:23.166 --> 44:25.900
(crowd cheering)

44:28.834 --> 44:33.066
Come on, come on, you
got it, you got it, yeah!

44:33.200 --> 44:34.200
What do you say, Mr. McBride?

44:34.333 --> 44:35.700
You want to give it a shot?

44:35.834 --> 44:38.367
Oh, do not challenge him
'cause he might just do it.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.900
No, but I have another
challenge in mind.

44:41.033 --> 44:42.667
Oh no, now you've done it.

44:44.500 --> 44:46.133
What'd I do?

44:46.266 --> 44:48.533
Be afraid.

44:48.667 --> 44:50.367
Okay.

44:50.500 --> 44:57.166
What are we playing for?

44:57.300 --> 44:58.200
Playing for chili?

44:58.333 --> 44:59.734
Well, not just any chili.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.133
Loser has to eat the
five alarm chili.

45:04.266 --> 45:10.867
Oh.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.433
You're on.

45:12.567 --> 45:13.867
No, no, no, Luke, listen.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.133
You don't have to, really.

45:15.266 --> 45:16.533
I'm feeling pretty
good about this.

45:16.667 --> 45:19.266
Plus I got a cast iron stomach.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.567
Oh gosh.

45:31.567 --> 45:35.533
Come on, Luke, you got this.

45:35.667 --> 45:36.700
Go, Luke!

45:36.834 --> 45:39.767
(cheering)

45:39.900 --> 45:41.300
Good, that was good.

45:41.433 --> 45:42.934
That was pretty good.

45:43.066 --> 45:44.533
All right, come on, Dad!

45:44.667 --> 45:45.934
What ever happened
to "Come on, Luke?"

45:46.066 --> 45:47.233
I don't know, he's family.

45:50.734 --> 45:51.600
(grunts)

45:51.734 --> 45:53.967
(cheering)

45:55.166 --> 45:57.767
Iron stomach.

45:57.900 --> 46:02.667
Nice one, Dad.

46:02.800 --> 46:05.333
Did I ever tell you
guys about the time-

46:05.467 --> 46:07.433
That you won the blue
ribbon at the chili cook-off?

46:07.567 --> 46:10.533
And held the title for two
years until Francis Miller won

46:10.667 --> 46:13.266
with what you thought
was a stolen recipe.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.266
Yes.

46:14.400 --> 46:15.667
Dad, we got it.

46:15.800 --> 46:17.000
Oh man, I just love this.

46:17.133 --> 46:19.500
Mr. North's chili is
always my favorite.

46:19.633 --> 46:21.100
How you doing
over there, Luke?

46:21.233 --> 46:22.834
I'm going, I'm going.

46:22.967 --> 46:24.100
Luke, don't worry, mate,

46:24.233 --> 46:26.600
the first aid tents
are right over there.

46:28.133 --> 46:32.600
Just in case.

46:32.734 --> 46:35.467
(gasping)

46:42.467 --> 46:43.333
It's not bad.

46:43.467 --> 46:47.600
(coughs)
(laughs)

46:50.633 --> 46:53.367
Oh man!

46:53.500 --> 46:55.834
This should be illegal, I
think my tongue's going numb.

46:55.967 --> 46:58.600
Good, because you have
to finish the whole bowl.

46:58.734 --> 46:59.600
Dad.

46:59.734 --> 47:02.400
I'm kidding, I'm just kidding.

47:02.533 --> 47:03.500
Are you crying?

47:04.533 --> 47:07.000
No, it's still burning.

47:07.133 --> 47:09.100
(laughs)

47:19.700 --> 47:21.000
[Hannah] Hey, you
just missed the guys.

47:21.133 --> 47:22.233
Oh yeah.

47:22.367 --> 47:23.667
I'm gonna meet up
with them later.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.667
Beth and I promised the girls
we'd make special cookies

47:25.800 --> 47:27.066
for grandma's birthday.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.333
That's sweet.

47:28.467 --> 47:30.333
(phone beeping)

47:30.467 --> 47:32.600
Wow, somebody's phone
is really blowing up.

47:33.633 --> 47:34.934
It's Beth's.

47:35.066 --> 47:37.100
She's still sleeping,
I'll drop it off to her.

47:42.300 --> 47:43.500
Huh.

47:43.633 --> 47:44.500
Everything okay?

47:44.633 --> 47:46.333
Yeah, fine.

47:51.367 --> 47:53.000
Good morning.

47:53.133 --> 47:54.166
Where are the girls?

47:54.300 --> 47:55.700
Playing in the living room.

47:58.800 --> 47:59.934
Why didn't you tell me?

48:00.133 --> 48:01.233
I can explain this.

48:01.367 --> 48:03.467
I thought we put
that behind us.

48:03.600 --> 48:04.900
You lied to me.

48:05.033 --> 48:06.600
I just sent a few ideas.

48:07.967 --> 48:12.000
Jason, wait.

48:12.133 --> 48:13.233
Hey.

48:13.367 --> 48:14.333
Where is everyone?

48:15.367 --> 48:16.233
There are a lot of us.

48:16.367 --> 48:17.600
Can you be more specific?

48:18.934 --> 48:20.233
Mom, Posy.

48:20.367 --> 48:21.233
Posy's heading to work.

48:21.367 --> 48:22.467
Mom's being pampered.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.800
It's just you here?

48:23.934 --> 48:25.066
Yes.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.233
Can you...

48:26.367 --> 48:28.967
Can you watch the
girls for a little bit?

48:29.100 --> 48:29.967
Watch them do what?

48:30.100 --> 48:31.000
Oh my...

48:31.133 --> 48:32.133
I'm joking.

48:32.266 --> 48:33.500
Of course I will.

48:34.533 --> 48:35.400
What is going on, Beth?

48:35.533 --> 48:37.233
Jason's upset.

48:38.467 --> 48:43.233
I may have not told him
something important.

48:43.367 --> 48:44.834
I think there's
a word for that.

48:44.967 --> 48:46.233
No.

48:46.367 --> 48:49.467
No, I did not lie, okay?

48:49.600 --> 48:50.567
Okay.

48:52.433 --> 48:55.834
Maybe a little.

48:55.967 --> 48:56.834
Fine, go.

48:56.967 --> 48:58.333
I've got the girls,

48:58.467 --> 49:00.333
unless of course you think
they're going to eat me alive.

49:01.367 --> 49:02.233
Go, Mom.

49:02.367 --> 49:03.333
Thank you, Hannah.

49:15.033 --> 49:17.333
Wow.

49:17.467 --> 49:19.500
(laughs)

49:19.633 --> 49:20.767
Thanks for walking me to work.

49:20.900 --> 49:21.767
You didn't have to do that.

49:21.900 --> 49:22.867
I wanted to.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.233
How's the book coming?

49:26.367 --> 49:27.233
Good.

49:27.367 --> 49:28.767
I hit a bit of a snag.

49:28.900 --> 49:30.433
Oh, writer's block?

49:30.567 --> 49:31.433
Yeah, something like that.

49:31.567 --> 49:32.767
I'm sure it'll
come back to ya.

49:34.900 --> 49:37.567
So how many rescues
have you been a part of?

49:37.700 --> 49:39.333
Not too many since I started.

49:39.467 --> 49:41.000
Luckily nothing too serious.

49:41.133 --> 49:43.333
Must get a lot of
satisfaction from it.

49:43.467 --> 49:44.900
Might sound crazy,

49:45.033 --> 49:47.400
but I feel like it brings me
closer to my birth parents.

49:47.533 --> 49:50.266
Swear I can feel them
with me sometimes.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.500
How does Suzanne feel
about you doing this?

49:54.633 --> 49:56.567
I know you said that she's
not crazy about your climbing,

49:56.700 --> 49:59.266
but I can imagine that'd
be hard for her too, right?

50:00.800 --> 50:04.000
Sure she'd rather I didn't,
though she'd never say it.

50:04.133 --> 50:05.400
It's normal.

50:05.533 --> 50:06.834
She just wants you to be safe.

50:06.967 --> 50:08.567
Yeah.

50:08.700 --> 50:11.066
It's more than that though.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.000
I didn't tell you
the whole story.

50:13.133 --> 50:16.767
Suzanne was actually
leading the expedition

50:16.900 --> 50:18.900
on the day that my parents died.

50:19.033 --> 50:20.600
Her and my mom
were best friends.

50:22.633 --> 50:24.567
They were a little ways
away from the summit

50:24.700 --> 50:27.166
and rocks triggered
a slide and...

50:31.033 --> 50:33.066
Posy, sometimes
it's no one's fault.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.100
Yeah, I know, that's what
we keep trying to tell her.

50:35.233 --> 50:36.200
She won't hear it.

50:38.367 --> 50:40.433
So they were still in
Michigan at the time?

50:40.567 --> 50:41.834
Yeah, yeah.

50:41.967 --> 50:44.166
They were just working
here for the winter,

50:44.300 --> 50:45.667
working as guides.

50:45.800 --> 50:48.333
This is where my dad, I mean,
Stewart's family is from.

50:49.867 --> 50:52.900
And so after they adopted us,
they knew they needed help,

50:53.033 --> 50:54.934
so they moved here to
be closer to family.

50:55.066 --> 50:56.066
And it worked out.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.266
They helped out with the cafe

50:57.400 --> 50:59.166
and his parents
helped out with us.

51:00.533 --> 51:02.066
The cafe was in the family.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.066
Yeah, they were so happy
when he took it over,

51:04.200 --> 51:07.834
and one day I will do the same.

51:11.300 --> 51:12.467
Well, thanks for the walk, Luke.

51:12.600 --> 51:13.900
You sure don't want
to come inside?

51:14.033 --> 51:16.467
I can hook you up with
our famous blueberry pie.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.400
Well, if you're
going to twist my arm.

51:25.600 --> 51:26.467
[Posy] There you go.

51:26.600 --> 51:27.567
Thank you.

51:28.600 --> 51:29.467
What do I owe you?

51:29.600 --> 51:30.667
Oh, it's on the house.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.500
Oh, in that case, I'll take
three more of these to go.

51:32.633 --> 51:34.300
Don't press your luck.

51:34.433 --> 51:35.967
Actually, I would like
to make a contribution

51:36.100 --> 51:37.400
to the mountain rescue fund,

51:37.533 --> 51:39.800
so could I get a dozen
of those cookies?

51:39.934 --> 51:41.233
That I'll happily
charge you for.

51:41.367 --> 51:42.467
Great.

51:42.600 --> 51:43.834
Oh, table three
needs their check.

51:43.967 --> 51:45.500
Oh, hey, Posy.

51:46.700 --> 51:50.567
I wanted to say thank
you for inviting me out

51:50.700 --> 51:52.166
with your family yesterday.

51:52.300 --> 51:53.400
I had a great time.

51:53.533 --> 51:54.800
Yeah, it was really fun.

51:54.934 --> 51:56.900
Everyone really likes you.

51:57.033 --> 51:59.266
Maybe we could do
it again sometime.

52:00.500 --> 52:02.367
Yeah, I'd love that.

52:02.500 --> 52:03.567
- Great.
- Yeah.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.800
But if people see us
hanging out together,

52:08.934 --> 52:12.133
they might get the
impression that we're dating.

52:12.266 --> 52:13.467
I don't worry about
what other people think.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.734
I don't think I believe you.

52:19.166 --> 52:20.934
(kisses)

52:21.066 --> 52:22.066
Believe me now?

52:31.767 --> 52:34.734
I told her I wasn't
interested in taking the job,

52:34.867 --> 52:35.834
I promise.

52:36.867 --> 52:39.533
But the next thing you know,

52:39.667 --> 52:43.967
she's convinced me to take a
stab at a marketing proposal.

52:44.100 --> 52:45.233
Convinced.

52:45.367 --> 52:46.500
More like manipulated.

52:48.934 --> 52:51.734
But Beth, we've always
told each other everything.

52:51.867 --> 52:52.834
Why not this?

52:55.266 --> 52:59.300
I don't know, I guess
I just wanted to know

52:59.433 --> 53:02.533
if I still have what it takes.

53:02.667 --> 53:04.967
Of course you still
have what it takes.

53:05.100 --> 53:06.734
You're great at
everything you do.

53:08.834 --> 53:13.433
I guess I just thought that
maybe after all these years,

53:13.567 --> 53:15.700
I've lost it, you know?

53:15.834 --> 53:17.367
I mean, Jason,

53:17.500 --> 53:19.266
if you had to give
up your career and be
a stay-at-home dad,

53:19.400 --> 53:20.800
you would've felt the same way.

53:20.934 --> 53:23.200
When we decided to have kids,

53:23.333 --> 53:25.600
it was your decision
to walk away.

53:25.734 --> 53:27.100
I know.

53:27.233 --> 53:28.533
If you really want
to go back to work,

53:28.667 --> 53:32.100
even if it is for
Corinna, I'll support you.

53:32.233 --> 53:33.700
We'll figure it out.

53:33.834 --> 53:35.800
You really think we
can make this work?

53:36.834 --> 53:39.367
I do.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.767
I'm sorry.

53:48.900 --> 53:51.767
It's okay.

53:51.900 --> 53:55.767
By the way, who's watching
the girls right now?

53:55.900 --> 53:57.100
[Hannah] Good job, girls.

53:57.233 --> 53:59.467
Your mom is going
to be so impressed.

54:01.133 --> 54:02.000
Aunt Hannah?

54:02.133 --> 54:03.333
Mm-hm?

54:03.467 --> 54:05.500
Do you think Bugsy will
ever find his way home?

54:05.633 --> 54:07.100
Sure.

54:07.233 --> 54:09.867
Did you ever lose someone
you love more than anything?

54:11.233 --> 54:13.333
Yeah, I did, honey.

54:13.467 --> 54:16.333
(phone ringing)

54:16.467 --> 54:17.867
I have to get this.

54:18.000 --> 54:18.867
We're going to have
a little break,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.767
but don't eat the product.

54:21.900 --> 54:22.934
All right?

54:23.066 --> 54:24.033
Hello?

54:30.467 --> 54:31.333
(girls laughing)

54:31.467 --> 54:32.367
Okay, sounds good.

54:32.500 --> 54:34.000
Oh, and heads up, they
don't make them anymore,

54:34.133 --> 54:36.100
so you're going to have
your work cut out for you.

54:36.233 --> 54:37.433
Tell you what, drop
everything you're doing,

54:37.567 --> 54:38.667
make it a top priority.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.200
Sure, let me do some digging.

54:40.333 --> 54:41.500
Great.

54:41.633 --> 54:42.767
And Lexi, I know that I
don't do a very good job

54:42.900 --> 54:45.667
of telling you this, but
I really appreciate you.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.667
I know, but it's
also nice to hear.

54:48.800 --> 54:49.767
All right, bye.

54:54.967 --> 54:57.033
(girls laughing)

54:57.166 --> 54:59.667
Melly, Ruby!

54:59.800 --> 55:00.834
We're home.

55:03.233 --> 55:06.266
I'm a cookie.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.600
So how are my little
cookie monsters?

55:08.734 --> 55:11.266
Oh, wow, I am so sorry.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.333
I only left them
for like a minute.

55:15.200 --> 55:18.667
Hey, girls, let's go
get cleaned up, come on.

55:18.800 --> 55:22.400
Okay.

55:22.533 --> 55:25.066
It only takes a second
for them to get into things.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.500
Well, thank goodness
it was something harmless

55:26.633 --> 55:27.600
like frosting.

55:27.734 --> 55:28.667
That's not the point, Hannah.

55:28.800 --> 55:29.667
What is your point?

55:29.800 --> 55:32.567
I asked you to watch them,

55:32.700 --> 55:36.333
not let them run wild while
you took care of work.

55:36.467 --> 55:37.400
I said I was sorry.

55:37.533 --> 55:38.600
You know what?

55:38.734 --> 55:39.600
This is my fault.

55:39.734 --> 55:40.867
I should have known better.

55:45.867 --> 55:48.667
Hannah, what I mean-

55:48.800 --> 55:50.100
Oh, I know what you mean.

55:51.400 --> 55:53.500
Hannah.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.300
I only left them
for like a minute.

56:23.433 --> 56:24.834
Yeah, not good.

56:24.967 --> 56:26.133
We were having so much fun.

56:26.266 --> 56:27.900
It was like I was the
cool aunt for once.

56:28.033 --> 56:30.233
Well, let's be clear,
I'm the cool aunt.

56:30.367 --> 56:31.467
Yeah, that's true.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.300
You know, Beth is right,
I'm not made for kids.

56:34.433 --> 56:36.300
Well, then you and Adam
are perfect for each other.

56:36.433 --> 56:37.633
You know, not
everyone wants kids.

56:37.767 --> 56:38.734
I'm pregnant.

56:41.633 --> 56:45.467
That is exactly
the reaction I had.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.233
I'm trying to picture
you with a baby.

56:47.367 --> 56:48.333
Posy!

56:50.433 --> 56:51.834
Oh my gosh.

56:51.967 --> 56:52.967
You're going to be a great mom.

56:53.100 --> 56:54.166
I get to be an aunt again!

56:54.300 --> 56:56.500
Oh, congratulations.

56:56.633 --> 56:57.734
You?

56:57.867 --> 56:58.967
I mean...

56:59.100 --> 57:01.133
I mean, you did seem
a little preoccupied,

57:01.266 --> 57:02.233
maybe a little bit distant.

57:02.367 --> 57:03.467
I mean, more so than normal.

57:03.600 --> 57:05.033
Sorry, that didn't
come out right.

57:05.166 --> 57:06.233
What did Adam say?

57:09.600 --> 57:11.300
Well...

57:11.433 --> 57:12.567
Hannah.

57:12.700 --> 57:14.066
We weren't going
to have children.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.867
This is something I made very
clear before we got married.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.567
I know, but
circumstances change.

57:19.700 --> 57:21.800
You have to trust that
things are gonna work out.

57:21.934 --> 57:23.533
I have always
loved that about you.

57:23.667 --> 57:25.200
You've loved what about me?

57:25.333 --> 57:26.533
You go with the flow.

57:26.667 --> 57:28.433
You're like water.

57:28.567 --> 57:29.433
I'm more like-

57:29.567 --> 57:30.900
A brick wall?

57:31.033 --> 57:33.133
Well, I might've
said more like a rock.

57:33.266 --> 57:34.133
That works too.

57:34.266 --> 57:35.233
But yes.

57:37.834 --> 57:43.567
Posy, I don't know if I have
what it takes to be a good mom.

57:43.700 --> 57:49.533
When we moved here after the
accident, I was so terrified.

57:49.667 --> 57:53.400
Everything we'd
ever known was gone.

57:53.533 --> 57:55.200
I'll never forget
how comforting it was

57:55.333 --> 57:57.633
to have you as my big sister.

57:57.767 --> 57:58.633
Really?

57:58.767 --> 57:59.734
Yeah.

58:01.066 --> 58:07.767
And that's how
you'll be as a mom.

58:07.900 --> 58:09.967
I'm just a little scared.

58:10.100 --> 58:15.066
[Posy] Yeah.

58:22.100 --> 58:25.800
Sure.

58:25.934 --> 58:26.967
Hi.

58:27.100 --> 58:27.967
[Luke] Hey.

58:28.100 --> 58:29.266
Welcome.

58:29.400 --> 58:30.700
Yes, sorry, I was
knocking for a while

58:30.834 --> 58:32.100
and I just let myself in.

58:32.233 --> 58:33.767
- That's great.
- Good.

58:33.900 --> 58:36.100
So one for the adults,
one for the kids.

58:36.233 --> 58:38.000
And there was a
package out front.

58:38.133 --> 58:39.000
That's for me.

58:39.133 --> 58:40.133
[Adam] Checkmate!

58:40.266 --> 58:41.133
It looks like
you're just in time

58:41.266 --> 58:42.133
to watch history be made.

58:42.266 --> 58:43.700
Thank you for these.

58:45.066 --> 58:47.600
I won.

58:47.734 --> 58:48.767
New chess master.

58:48.900 --> 58:49.800
Yeah!

58:49.934 --> 58:51.967
(cheering)

58:52.100 --> 58:53.200
Thank you very much.

58:53.333 --> 58:54.867
Oh, please, no,
it's no big deal.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.367
(calm music)

59:16.467 --> 59:17.433
(laughs) We all came
running into the room

59:17.567 --> 59:18.700
and there was Posy,

59:18.834 --> 59:20.600
just standing on top
of the refrigerator.

59:20.734 --> 59:22.867
What was she, about
five years old?

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Her first official summit.

59:25.133 --> 59:26.500
You were like a
little mountain goat,

59:26.633 --> 59:28.166
climbing everything in sight.

59:28.300 --> 59:30.166
Oh, it was like
she had no fear.

59:30.300 --> 59:32.367
You know, one of my favorite
memories of her as a kid is

59:32.500 --> 59:33.600
when we got snowed
in at Christmas.

59:33.734 --> 59:34.600
Do you remember that?

59:34.734 --> 59:35.600
Right, okay.

59:35.734 --> 59:36.700
So it snowed three days straight

59:36.834 --> 59:38.200
and we couldn't leave the house.

59:38.333 --> 59:40.333
So Posy's coming down the
stairs with a little toy shovel

59:40.467 --> 59:43.433
saying she's going to
tunnel her way out.

59:43.567 --> 59:44.700
I believed her.

59:44.834 --> 59:45.700
We all did.

59:45.834 --> 59:46.700
That's been fun.

59:46.834 --> 59:48.266
Enough Posy stories.

59:48.400 --> 59:49.834
No, no, no, I love
this kind of stuff.

59:49.967 --> 59:51.600
What's your favorite
childhood memory?

59:51.734 --> 59:53.033
Easy.

59:53.166 --> 59:55.500
10th birthday, my aunt
gave me my first real tent.

59:55.633 --> 59:58.600
So I camped out in the
backyard every night,

59:58.734 --> 01:00:01.100
but I pretended I
was on Half Dome.

01:00:01.233 --> 01:00:04.000
I thought to myself, I
could live like this.

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:06.867
And you do.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:07.934
You live your dream.

01:00:08.066 --> 01:00:09.166
Been very lucky.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.767
Suzanne and I spent an
anniversary bivouacked

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.000
on Half Dome.

01:00:13.133 --> 01:00:14.433
What's bivouacked?

01:00:14.567 --> 01:00:16.667
Well, sometimes it
takes more than one day

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.000
to complete a climb,

01:00:18.133 --> 01:00:21.867
so you sleep hanging off
the side of the rock.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.867
Why?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.367
My question exactly, Melly.

01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:27.000
You really did that, Grandma?

01:00:27.133 --> 01:00:28.166
Mm-hm.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.934
Your grandma was
quite the mountaineer.

01:00:30.066 --> 01:00:31.533
Why don't you climb anymore?

01:00:32.967 --> 01:00:34.834
Oh, it was a long time ago.

01:00:34.967 --> 01:00:35.834
Yeah.

01:00:35.967 --> 01:00:36.867
Who's ready for
her birthday cake?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.433
That sounds great!

01:00:40.133 --> 01:00:41.133
Great idea.

01:00:41.266 --> 01:00:42.166
- Beth, will you help me?
- Yeah.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.333
So Luke, what's the next stop?

01:00:44.467 --> 01:00:45.433
Chicago.

01:00:45.567 --> 01:00:46.600
Promised my aunt I'd be back

01:00:46.734 --> 01:00:48.934
for the annual Whitaker
family reunion.

01:00:49.066 --> 01:00:51.000
- Oh, that sounds nice.
- Yeah.

01:00:51.133 --> 01:00:56.100
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

01:00:57.133 --> 01:01:00.500
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

01:01:00.633 --> 01:01:05.600

01:01:06.967 --> 01:01:11.000

01:01:11.133 --> 01:01:12.000

Happy 30th times two.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.166
It's perfect.

01:01:16.967 --> 01:01:18.667
Okay.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:24.567
Here we go.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.900
(clapping)

01:01:28.033 --> 01:01:28.900
Thank you.

01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:30.867
Wait, Whitaker.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Luke Whitaker.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:38.166
I knew you seemed familiar.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.000
Hannah, what are
you talking about?

01:01:40.133 --> 01:01:41.266
A few months ago,

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.266
I got some messages
from a Luke Whitaker

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.834
who wanted to know
about the accident.

01:01:46.967 --> 01:01:50.200
Wait, I got those
phone calls too.

01:01:52.533 --> 01:01:53.834
Was that you?

01:01:53.967 --> 01:01:56.233
What are you
guys talking about?

01:01:56.367 --> 01:01:57.500
I can explain.

01:01:57.633 --> 01:01:58.834
Explain what?

01:01:58.967 --> 01:02:00.066
That's a new low.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.400
It's not that simple.

01:02:01.533 --> 01:02:03.133
See, we've had people
chase this story before,

01:02:03.266 --> 01:02:05.734
but none of them have
moved into the guest house.

01:02:07.033 --> 01:02:09.300
A lot of people die climbing.

01:02:09.433 --> 01:02:11.667
Why is our story so
important to you?

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.633
Okay, girls.

01:02:15.767 --> 01:02:17.300
We are going to go upstairs
and get ready for bed.

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:18.800
What about cake?

01:02:18.934 --> 01:02:21.667
Well, we are going to
have cake after, I promise.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.967
Yeah, great idea.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.400
I was going to get
ready for bed too

01:02:24.533 --> 01:02:27.767
so then later we can have
some cake in our PJs.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:35.667
Okay.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.800
I'm not just some
guy chasing a story.

01:02:39.934 --> 01:02:45.233
My real last name is Palmer.

01:02:45.367 --> 01:02:51.166
Cheryl and Brett Palmer?

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.633
My parents were
the other couple

01:02:52.767 --> 01:02:54.433
that died that day on Denali.

01:03:05.867 --> 01:03:10.166
a.

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:11.834
Posy, if I could just explain-

01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:12.834
Excuse me.

01:03:12.967 --> 01:03:14.200
- Posy.
- Honey, wait.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:20.433
Sit down, young man.

01:03:26.467 --> 01:03:29.667
I was going to tell her.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.400
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

01:03:34.533 --> 01:03:39.600
I'll pack my things and
be gone in the morning.

01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:44.233
I thought about you.

01:03:44.367 --> 01:03:48.233
All the time.

01:03:48.367 --> 01:03:52.266
I didn't have the
courage to reach out.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.900
I couldn't face you.

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:59.000
I understand.

01:03:59.133 --> 01:04:00.166
I just thought
you'd be better off

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.734
without me as a reminder.

01:04:03.633 --> 01:04:07.300
The woman who ruined your life.

01:04:07.433 --> 01:04:10.300
Luke, I'm so sorry.

01:04:10.433 --> 01:04:13.567
You don't need to apologize.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.300
It wasn't your fault

01:04:15.433 --> 01:04:17.333
and you didn't ruin my life.

01:04:18.633 --> 01:04:23.066
I've had an amazing life.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.066
I wanna hear.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.400
Everything.

01:04:38.433 --> 01:04:39.734
Hi, Colin, can we sit here?

01:04:39.867 --> 01:04:40.834
Of course.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.133
The McBride sisters,
together again.

01:04:45.266 --> 01:04:46.233
What can I get you ladies?

01:04:46.367 --> 01:04:47.333
White wine, please.

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:48.500
Bring the bottle.

01:04:48.633 --> 01:04:49.900
I'll just have
a water, thanks.

01:04:50.033 --> 01:04:51.000
Coming right up.

01:04:53.133 --> 01:04:55.066
How could I be so gullible?

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.333
It's not your fault.

01:04:57.767 --> 01:04:59.066
I really liked him.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.300
Oh.

01:05:00.433 --> 01:05:01.533
We don't know the whole story.

01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:02.700
Oh, come on, you
can't be serious.

01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:05.033
Maybe he's
looking for closure.

01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:06.567
I mean, if anyone
can be sympathetic

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.033
to what he's going
through, it's us.

01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:10.233
No, no, no, I can't
believe I'm hearing this.

01:05:10.367 --> 01:05:11.800
He lied to her.

01:05:11.934 --> 01:05:14.200
Okay, I admit I like
this new side to you.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:17.367
Yeah, well, somebody hurts
my little sister, I get angry.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.633
I'd do the same for you.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.867
Okay, I saw that.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.066
What?

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.633
You don't think
I'd stand up for you.

01:05:25.767 --> 01:05:26.967
I don't think you
think about me much.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.700
Can we not argue?

01:05:28.834 --> 01:05:30.700
No, let's have it out
right here, right now.

01:05:30.834 --> 01:05:32.800
So how's your
evening going so far?

01:05:32.934 --> 01:05:34.800
[All] Not now, Colin.

01:05:34.934 --> 01:05:35.900
Right.

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:37.800
You know what?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:38.900
Hannah's right.

01:05:40.166 --> 01:05:43.200
I'm so tired of us all
tiptoeing around everything.

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:45.500
Why did we stop being
honest with each other?

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:47.800
Don't you think it's weird

01:05:47.934 --> 01:05:49.467
that we never talk
about the accident?

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.800
We don't talk about it
because we are protecting Mom.

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.133
But why?

01:05:55.266 --> 01:05:56.133
Why do you think everyone
needs protecting?

01:05:56.266 --> 01:05:57.367
Mom, Melly, Ruby?

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.800
Can we leave the
girls out of this?

01:05:58.934 --> 01:06:01.100
I'm just saying that
they'll never have a chance

01:06:01.233 --> 01:06:02.266
to skin their knees.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.967
A few bumps and bruises
are good for kids.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.367
Says the woman with no kids.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.300
It's not that you're
just overprotective.

01:06:08.433 --> 01:06:10.300
You catastrophize everything.

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:13.200
I catastrophize everything
because bad things do happen.

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:15.700
Posy, they happen to us.

01:06:15.834 --> 01:06:16.934
Beth is right.

01:06:17.066 --> 01:06:19.033
It is so scary to bring
a kid into the world

01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:20.266
that is so uncertain

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.300
where parents could just
be swept away like that.

01:06:22.433 --> 01:06:24.700
They need certainty
and stability.

01:06:24.834 --> 01:06:26.266
Sorry, Hannah, I
love you, I do, I just,

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.033
I just don't think you
know what's best for kids.

01:06:30.166 --> 01:06:31.533
Beth.

01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:33.867
I have lost count of how
many times you have canceled

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.300
on Melly and Ruby.

01:06:35.433 --> 01:06:37.533
Have you thought about
how that makes them feel?

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:38.767
It's just, I-

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.700
Please don't say
that you're busy.

01:06:40.834 --> 01:06:41.700
Do you want to know the truth?

01:06:41.834 --> 01:06:44.033
I love those girls, but I...

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.133
What?

01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:49.600
What?

01:06:49.734 --> 01:06:53.967
It's just too hard.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:58.400
They remind me of
you and Posy when...

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.500
When Mom and Dad died.

01:07:07.633 --> 01:07:12.433
And you, I will never
forget how afraid you were.

01:07:15.467 --> 01:07:19.367
And I wanted so badly
to save you from pain,

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.300
but I didn't know how.

01:07:23.333 --> 01:07:25.200
You did.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:26.200
You did.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:27.433
Yeah.

01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:28.500
I don't know what
I would have done

01:07:28.633 --> 01:07:30.266
if I didn't have you to lean on.

01:07:32.467 --> 01:07:35.266
Hannah, you were
just a kid too.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.767
That wasn't fair to you.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.266
I just,

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.200
I never considered how hard
that must've been for you.

01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:44.300
I'm sorry.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.700
Sounds a lot like motherhood.

01:07:49.834 --> 01:07:54.433
No matter how you felt,
you were always there for us.

01:07:54.567 --> 01:07:59.033
That's why you'll
make a great mom.

01:08:02.133 --> 01:08:03.433
Oh my...

01:08:03.567 --> 01:08:04.867
You're pregnant.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.500
I think she's blown a fuse.

01:08:10.633 --> 01:08:16.000
(laughs)

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:18.166
For the record, I'll
still be the cool aunt.

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.332
(laughs)

01:08:21.533 --> 01:08:24.567
I've made a career
writing travel guides

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.867
related to climbing.

01:08:27.066 --> 01:08:29.332
But I decided that I
wanted to shift gears

01:08:29.466 --> 01:08:31.265
and write about
something different.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:35.399
So I set out to write
a survival book,

01:08:35.533 --> 01:08:37.767
not just for climbers
that survived accidents,

01:08:37.899 --> 01:08:40.500
but for the people
that were left behind

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.066
by climbers that
weren't so lucky.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.667
People like you all.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.332
Like Hannah, Beth, and Posy.

01:08:50.466 --> 01:08:53.399
People like myself.

01:08:53.533 --> 01:08:58.066
I thought it might
bring some closure.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.066
We could all use some closure.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:05.133
I don't blame you, Suzanne.

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:07.966
After all the research that
I've done about that day,

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.500
nothing points to anything

01:09:09.633 --> 01:09:12.133
other than a random
act of nature.

01:09:12.265 --> 01:09:13.667
There are always signs.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.567
Yes, but my parents chose
to go up there that day.

01:09:18.767 --> 01:09:21.000
As climbers, we know
there are always risks

01:09:21.133 --> 01:09:23.000
and we calculate those risks.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.567
And it's not my
place to say this,

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.300
but it seems to me like the
best way to honor my parents is

01:09:28.433 --> 01:09:29.834
for you to forgive yourself.

01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:34.834
(Suzanne crying)

01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:47.734
Thank you.

01:09:52.767 --> 01:09:53.899
(phone ringing)

01:09:54.033 --> 01:09:57.633
Oh, I swear, this
woman never sleeps.

01:09:57.767 --> 01:09:59.734
She's constantly
calling me, texting me.

01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:01.567
Hannah, what are you doing?

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.467
(gasps) You're going
to get me fired.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.800
She can't fire you if
she hasn't hired you.

01:10:06.934 --> 01:10:08.400
She is using you.

01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:10.400
Beth, if you want to go
back to work, that's great.

01:10:10.533 --> 01:10:12.900
There are plenty of places that
would be lucky to have you,

01:10:13.033 --> 01:10:14.967
places that won't
make you miserable

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.400
like working with Corinna.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.667
I know, but it's
been seven years,

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.567
I wouldn't even know
where to start, Hannah.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.133
Well, I'll help
you if you'll let me.

01:10:23.266 --> 01:10:25.233
(sighs)

01:10:27.367 --> 01:10:29.333
Okay, but only if you let
me help you with the baby.

01:10:29.467 --> 01:10:30.433
Count on it.

01:10:35.767 --> 01:10:37.166
Bye, Corinna.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.500
Bye.

01:10:38.633 --> 01:10:41.567
(cheering)

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.567
I feel good.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.567
Congratulations, you are free.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.066
Okay, now that
we've dealt with that,

01:10:49.467 --> 01:10:52.133
let's deal with you.

01:10:52.266 --> 01:10:54.800
Oh, I'm good.

01:10:54.934 --> 01:10:56.900
My life is here,
I'm cool with that.

01:10:57.033 --> 01:10:59.567
No, no.

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.967
You deserve to be happy.

01:11:02.834 --> 01:11:08.633
What about everything you
said before about sacrifice?

01:11:08.767 --> 01:11:11.633
I was wrong.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:13.467
I'm sorry if I made you feel

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.867
like Mom and Dad's happiness
was your responsibility.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.133
Shouldn't live your life

01:11:18.266 --> 01:11:20.133
according to what
someone else wants.

01:11:21.333 --> 01:11:23.633
They've done so much for us.

01:11:23.767 --> 01:11:25.200
Yeah.

01:11:25.333 --> 01:11:27.367
But you should
pursue your passion.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:31.467
And if that means venturing
out, then so be it.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.166
Mom and Dad will understand.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.533
Can we make this a tradition?

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:39.867
Every year, the McBride
sisters get together

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.467
and really be honest
about their lives?

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.133
I'd really like that.

01:11:46.266 --> 01:11:47.734
Me too.

01:11:47.867 --> 01:11:49.567
I really love you guys.

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:50.800
Is it safe?

01:11:50.934 --> 01:11:51.800
(laughs)

01:11:51.934 --> 01:11:52.800
Yes, Colin.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:53.900
I'll take it, I'll take it.

01:11:54.934 --> 01:11:55.800
All right.

01:11:55.934 --> 01:11:56.867
Little sis, paying the bill.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.967
- Thanks, Posy.
- Thanks, Posy.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.967
There's still one more thing
you need to take care of.

01:12:04.433 --> 01:12:08.633
What are you going
to do about Luke?

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.133
Oh.

01:12:19.266 --> 01:12:20.567
Hey, Mom.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.500
Hey, are you okay?

01:12:22.633 --> 01:12:25.300
Yes, I'm so sorry I ran out.

01:12:25.433 --> 01:12:27.633
You didn't get to
do your presents

01:12:27.767 --> 01:12:29.633
or your cake or anything.

01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:33.133
The girls got into the cake,
so we all just joined in.

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:35.066
Can I get you girls some?

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.300
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay.

01:12:36.433 --> 01:12:37.667
I'm going to go
tuck the girls in.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.767
I love you.

01:12:39.934 --> 01:12:41.133
I'll see you upstairs, hon.

01:12:41.266 --> 01:12:42.734
Yeah, sure.

01:12:42.867 --> 01:12:44.066
- Night, Mom.
- Night, sweetie.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.266
- Girls.
- Night, Dad.

01:12:46.333 --> 01:12:49.400
Okay, come here.

01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:53.066
So Luke and I had
a really good talk.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.667
We talked about the accident.

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.900
Mom.

01:12:57.033 --> 01:12:58.133
I can't tell you
what a relief it is

01:12:58.266 --> 01:12:59.667
knowing he doesn't blame me.

01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:03.367
It's like I can finally
see through this cloud

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.300
that's been hanging over my
head for the past 25 years.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.800
Mom, that's so
much to carry around.

01:13:10.934 --> 01:13:13.734
I think Luke is the
best birthday gift

01:13:13.867 --> 01:13:15.400
I could have asked for.

01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:19.867
We also talked about you.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.133
Now, I'm not playing matchmaker,

01:13:22.266 --> 01:13:24.400
but I know his feelings
for you are genuine.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:32.633
Just I don't know how I
could ever trust him again.

01:13:32.767 --> 01:13:36.033
Forgiveness is a good start.

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:39.033
You seem made for each other.

01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:40.300
I've never seen two people

01:13:40.433 --> 01:13:42.467
who loved the mountains
more than you do.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.633
It's your calling.

01:13:47.767 --> 01:13:49.367
Look at me.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:54.967
The cafe will survive, honey.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.533
But you and Dad, you
have plans to retire.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.367
If there's one thing
I've learned for sure,

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.467
it's plans change.

01:14:03.734 --> 01:14:07.100
You need to follow
your heart, Posy.

01:14:07.233 --> 01:14:14.033
And if that leads you to the
peaks of Europe, then so be it.

01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:15.433
Yeah, but you and Dad,

01:14:15.567 --> 01:14:17.633
you guys didn't get a
chance to have that freedom.

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.867
You need to
understand something.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.367
Our lives have been so
much richer because of you.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.633
Sometimes you find your calling,

01:14:32.767 --> 01:14:37.767
but sometimes your
calling finds you.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:43.433
Raising you girls was ours.

01:14:43.567 --> 01:14:47.867
Thank you.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.867
I was thinking.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.100
I could talk to Paul

01:14:51.233 --> 01:14:53.367
about working from home
a couple of days a week.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.767
He's a reasonable guy.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.266
Don't hate me,

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.600
but I have decided not to
go back to work for Corinna.

01:14:58.734 --> 01:14:59.600
Oh.

01:14:59.734 --> 01:15:00.834
I think I'm going to wait

01:15:00.967 --> 01:15:02.367
for something
that's a better fit.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:05.834
And Hannah has said she'd
helped me find something.

01:15:05.967 --> 01:15:07.767
Oh, wow.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.266
Why the change of heart?

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.367
What started as
excitement, I don't know,

01:15:18.567 --> 01:15:21.600
turned into anxiety.

01:15:21.734 --> 01:15:23.667
Started to remember why I
was happy to leave there

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.934
in the first place.

01:15:25.967 --> 01:15:28.667
Good.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.867
But I think I'm going to try

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.767
and work from home a
couple of days anyway.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.600
I mean, the girls aren't
going to be young forever

01:15:33.734 --> 01:15:36.934
and I'd like to be around more.

01:15:41.066 --> 01:15:44.266
(kisses)

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:49.266
I'd like that.

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.000
Hey, how's Posy?

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:54.600
Oh, she'll be fine.

01:15:54.734 --> 01:15:55.700
She's tough.

01:15:57.834 --> 01:15:59.533
You know, we talked.

01:15:59.667 --> 01:16:00.834
Like really talked,

01:16:00.967 --> 01:16:03.100
and having it out with
those two was like,

01:16:03.233 --> 01:16:05.667
it was like getting a gift
I didn't know I needed.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.500
Yeah, those are the best kind.

01:16:14.567 --> 01:16:18.834
I'm pregnant, Adam.

01:16:28.867 --> 01:16:32.333
(gentle music)

01:16:37.367 --> 01:16:39.934
I'm going to be a dad?

01:16:40.066 --> 01:16:42.333
Yeah, you're not disappointed?

01:16:42.467 --> 01:16:45.100
Disappointed, what, that
we're going to have a family?

01:16:46.367 --> 01:16:48.066
I couldn't be happier.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.500
I don't know,

01:16:49.633 --> 01:16:50.500
we always said we weren't
going to have kids.

01:16:50.633 --> 01:16:52.934
Yeah, well, things change.

01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:54.667
They're gonna change a lot.

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:56.667
You're not worried?

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.367
Hey, do I look worried?

01:16:59.633 --> 01:17:00.567
Little bit.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:01.967
Do I?

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.066
Little bit?

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.900
I love you.

01:17:06.033 --> 01:17:09.834
I love you.

01:17:09.967 --> 01:17:13.400
(kisses)

01:17:17.433 --> 01:17:19.300
[Beth] The end.

01:17:19.433 --> 01:17:20.400
One more?

01:17:21.967 --> 01:17:24.967
And then you promise
you'll go to bed?

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:29.834
Okay, go pick one.

01:17:29.967 --> 01:17:31.834
What do we have here?

01:17:31.967 --> 01:17:34.734
Oh, yes.

01:17:34.867 --> 01:17:36.467
Do you know that Hannah
used to read this

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.233
to Posy and me when
we were your age?

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:44.567
Hey, I just wanted
to say good night.

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.900
Will you read with us?

01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:48.500
Is there room?

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.500
Get in here.

01:17:52.633 --> 01:17:54.000
Wow, you're still up.

01:17:54.133 --> 01:17:57.066
Yeah, we're just about to
read our favorite bedtime story.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.567
Come on, we'll make room.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:03.000
I would love to, but girls,

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:09.033
there was somebody that was
just sitting in the hall.

01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:13.700
The fairies heard our wishes!

01:18:13.834 --> 01:18:16.467
They sure did.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.700
Thank you.

01:18:18.834 --> 01:18:23.467
Of course.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.900
You mind?

01:18:31.033 --> 01:18:32.734
Do I mind?

01:18:32.867 --> 01:18:33.834
All right, girls.

01:18:37.033 --> 01:18:37.900
You ready?

01:18:38.033 --> 01:18:39.066
Yeah.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.533
Okay.

01:18:40.667 --> 01:18:43.000
"There was once a
velveteen rabbit

01:18:44.533 --> 01:18:47.633
"and in the beginning
he was really splendid.

01:18:47.767 --> 01:18:51.900
"He was fat and punchy
as a rabbit should be."

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.700
Hey.

01:19:06.734 --> 01:19:09.266
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.367
Yeah, well,

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.367
my mom said something last
night about forgiveness

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.600
and I put myself in your shoes

01:19:17.734 --> 01:19:21.900
and it turns out they
feel a lot like my shoes.

01:19:23.834 --> 01:19:26.800
Guess we share a tragedy.

01:19:26.934 --> 01:19:30.266
Yeah.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:35.033
I'm really sorry you
lost your parents, Luke.

01:19:35.166 --> 01:19:39.367
You had every
right to be upset.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.767
Luke, I have to ask,
if I hadn't found out,

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.400
were you ever going to tell me?

01:19:46.667 --> 01:19:51.867
My intention was to research
the accident for the book,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.266
but then everything changed.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.767
I fell in love with this place.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:02.367
The mountains, your family.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.266
I fell in love with you.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.934
Every time I worked up
the courage to tell you,

01:20:08.066 --> 01:20:11.033
I would talk myself out of it

01:20:11.166 --> 01:20:13.900
because I didn't want to risk
ruining our relationship.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:21.100
I'm sorry.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:26.200
I don't blame you if you never
want to talk to me again.

01:20:31.233 --> 01:20:35.633
I accept your apology.

01:20:35.767 --> 01:20:37.767
Hey, I have to get
back to the house.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.300
Call it Mom's birthday 2.0.

01:20:41.834 --> 01:20:45.433
Do you want to join?

01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:46.700
Are you sure?

01:20:46.834 --> 01:20:48.033
Say yes before
I change my mind.

01:20:49.166 --> 01:20:51.633
Yes.

01:20:57.667 --> 01:21:00.600
[Girls] One, two,
three, open your eyes!

01:21:00.734 --> 01:21:02.000
[All] Surprise!

01:21:02.133 --> 01:21:04.300
(cheering)

01:21:07.467 --> 01:21:09.266
Come here, we have
a chair for you.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.600
Sit down, sit down, here you go.

01:21:11.734 --> 01:21:15.000
So since last night
got cut a little short,

01:21:15.133 --> 01:21:17.100
we thought we would
try this again.

01:21:17.233 --> 01:21:18.834
(laughs) You guys.

01:21:18.967 --> 01:21:21.700
This is from me,
Beth, and Hannah.

01:21:21.834 --> 01:21:23.767
Oh, girls, you spoil me.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:31.100
Oh.

01:21:31.233 --> 01:21:33.834
I love it.

01:21:33.967 --> 01:21:36.367
It's going on the mantle.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.333
Look, honey.

01:21:38.467 --> 01:21:40.600
Thank you.

01:21:40.734 --> 01:21:44.433
Okay, Adam and I have a
little something for you.

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:45.934
Actually, it's for both of you.

01:21:46.066 --> 01:21:47.033
Okay.

01:21:50.133 --> 01:21:54.500
"Dear Mom, surprise!

01:21:54.633 --> 01:21:57.867
"Baby on the way."

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.667
Are you kidding me?

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.734
Oh, honey!

01:22:00.867 --> 01:22:03.033
(cheering)

01:22:06.367 --> 01:22:07.900
(kisses)

01:22:08.033 --> 01:22:08.900
Are they crying?

01:22:09.033 --> 01:22:10.567
These are happy tears, honey.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:13.066
We're going to be
grandparents again.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.500
Your Auntie Hannah
is having a baby.

01:22:15.633 --> 01:22:18.166
You and Ruby are going to
have a little cousin soon.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.400
Congratulations on
becoming an aunt, again.

01:22:23.533 --> 01:22:24.500
Thanks.

01:22:26.033 --> 01:22:29.667
Thanks for coming in here
and disrupting our lives.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.000
If the offer still stands,

01:22:31.133 --> 01:22:33.734
I would love to go to
Switzerland with you.

01:22:33.867 --> 01:22:35.433
Nothing would make me happier.

01:22:43.734 --> 01:22:49.734
All right, I would
like to propose a toast.

01:22:49.867 --> 01:22:52.934
To family.

01:22:53.066 --> 01:22:58.400
Even the ones who aren't with
us who we miss every day.

01:22:58.533 --> 01:23:02.233
Michelle and Jerry gave
us the gift of a lifetime.

01:23:02.367 --> 01:23:06.567
You three beautiful girls.

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.900
Thank you.

01:23:09.033 --> 01:23:09.967
Cheers!

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.400
Cheers.

01:23:11.533 --> 01:23:13.000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:23:14.934 --> 01:23:17.567
Cheers, Grandpa.

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.133
- Let's hug it out.
- Okay.

01:23:19.266 --> 01:23:20.667
Get over here, girls!

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.767
Oh.

01:23:22.967 --> 01:23:25.233
Happy birthday, Mom.

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:28.834
I love you girls.
