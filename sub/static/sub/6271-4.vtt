00:13.381 --> 00:14.613
Something is coming.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.615
Something powerful, wild.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.150

00:20.521 --> 00:22.021
I'm sorry.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.756
I-I didn't know
your wife's birthday.

00:23.758 --> 00:26.125
- Some guy came around here
looking for you.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.292
- Who?

00:27.294 --> 00:28.694
- I don't know who he was.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.163
Waited for a while and then
put a note on the board.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.641
- Do you have a secret,
detective?

00:42.643 --> 00:46.378
One you don't even want
to tell yourself?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.213
- How would I know if I did?

00:48.215 --> 00:49.581
- I think you do.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.517
I think everybody does.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.520
- Listen, I had no idea she was
married when I first met her.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.089
How would I have known?
She never mentioned it.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.223
Are you sisters?

00:58.225 --> 01:02.127
- In-law.
We're married to brothers.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.531
He wants to fuck one of us.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.232
- I'll reschedule
the meeting with harry.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.534
- No, don't.

01:08.536 --> 01:11.670
Dad, you're on child care
this morning.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.472
- Tell me
about this book of yours.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.408
So how is it different?

01:16.410 --> 01:19.178
- He kills her...

01:19.180 --> 01:20.345
In the end.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.548
You can't rush me.

01:22.550 --> 01:26.185
But I want to be
in charge, okay?

06:37.965 --> 06:40.799

Thanks for that.

06:47.607 --> 06:51.476

[bicycle bell rings]

09:05.611 --> 09:07.746
- It says here,
when it was built in 1875,

09:07.748 --> 09:09.814
The light was the strongest
on the east coast,

09:09.816 --> 09:11.983
And it's one of only
12 lighthouses in the country

09:11.985 --> 09:15.620
Still equipped
with a first-order fresnel lens.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.290
- No, no.
The fresnel lens is incredible.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.292
Fresnel was
this french physicist

09:20.294 --> 09:22.193
Who had the idea
to take a glass lens

09:22.195 --> 09:24.162
And cut grooves in it
in concentric circles.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.897
And each groove
acts like a prism

09:25.899 --> 09:27.165
That refracts the source light

09:27.167 --> 09:28.900
And concentrates it into a beam

09:28.902 --> 09:30.101
That can be seen
much further away

09:30.103 --> 09:32.170
Using a much thinner piece
of glass.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.806
And the first-order lens,
which is what this is,

09:34.808 --> 09:38.043
Is the biggest one 'cause it's
got a prismatic dome on top.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.846
You can see it from, like,
30 miles.

09:41.848 --> 09:45.317

This shit really interests me.

09:45.319 --> 09:46.918

09:46.920 --> 09:48.587
- I'll just stop talking.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.788
- No.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.056
It's great to hear.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.824
- Get anything of what I said?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.793
- No.

But it doesn't matter.

you're describing something

09:57.898 --> 09:59.331

It certainly is beautiful.

- Yes.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.305
- Three?

10:07.307 --> 10:08.940
- You see, this is why
I didn't want to tell you.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.942
I knew you'd make fun of me.
- No, I'm sorry.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.344
You're right.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.713
But three, like the number
that comes after two?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.214

a virgin, right?

10:18.185 --> 10:19.651
You do know that?

10:19.653 --> 10:21.052

I told you.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.223

10:26.693 --> 10:28.226

in high school.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.128
- What, because you were
on the chess team?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.998

10:33.000 --> 10:35.233
No, 'cause my, uh...

10:35.235 --> 10:38.036
My mother was sick.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.672
- With what?

10:40.674 --> 10:42.240
- She had m.S.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.644
She died when I was 17.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.846
- Wow.

10:47.848 --> 10:48.980
I'm so sorry.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.883
- Yeah, thanks.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.852
It was pretty all-consuming.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.054
I couldn't bring
anyone home, and...

10:56.056 --> 10:58.857
I felt guilty
whenever I was away, so...

10:58.859 --> 11:01.893
I slept for most of high school.
That's what I did for fun.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.868
How about you?
How many?

11:09.870 --> 11:11.236
- Thousands.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.374
- Are they both dead?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.442
- No.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.344
My grandmother's still alive.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.880
She's in a home
on the north shore.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.815
I wish she was closer,
but I couldn't afford

11:23.817 --> 11:25.950
To put her
anywhere in the hamptons.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.852
But, you know,
I get to see her once a week,

11:27.854 --> 11:30.021
So it isn't too bad.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.122
She has alzheimer's.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.158
- Man, that's the worst.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.894
- No, it's not the worst.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.729
But it's not great.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.030
- And your mom--
where's she?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.965

11:40.967 --> 11:43.034
She's like the wind.
She goes where she wants.

Here we are...

11:49.910 --> 11:51.142
[chuckles]

11:51.144 --> 11:53.878
My favorite spot
on the island.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.381
They're called
the mohegan bluffs,

11:56.383 --> 11:58.049
'cause in the 16th century,

11:58.051 --> 12:00.919
When the mohegan indians
tried to invade the island,

12:00.921 --> 12:03.788
The native niantic
pushed them back over this cliff

12:03.790 --> 12:04.422
And to their death.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.092
- Jesus.

12:07.094 --> 12:11.196
My grandfather used to bring me
out here when I was a kid.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.733
He was a bit
of a shipwreck fanatic.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.201
There's one right out there,

12:16.203 --> 12:18.203
Past the break.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.471
And sometimes
when the tide is low,

12:19.473 --> 12:22.774
You can still see
the tip of the mast.

12:22.776 --> 12:26.511
We used to come down here and
would pretend it was neverland,

12:26.513 --> 12:28.747
And peter pan and the lost boys
were on the shipwreck,

12:28.749 --> 12:33.084
And I was tiger lily,
waiting for them on the beach.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.285
My grandfather used to say,

12:34.287 --> 12:38.256
If I listened closely
to the wind,

12:38.258 --> 12:42.794
I would hear peter
calling for me.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.964
- Sounds like a nice man,
your grandfather.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.333
- He really was.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.502
He was something else.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.364
What now, friend?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.941
So how's the writing going?

13:29.943 --> 13:32.310
- It's pretty good, actually.
[clears throat]

13:32.312 --> 13:34.312
I finished the first chapter
this week.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.980
- Wow.
You did?

13:35.982 --> 13:39.350
- Yeah, I sent the pages over
to bruce's editor.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.352
- And what did he say?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.388
- Uh, he hasn't responded.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.023
It's probably not a good sign.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.826
- Well, maybe
he hasn't read 'em yet.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.027
- Yeah, maybe.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.162
I should never have sent them.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.831
Stupid thing to do.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.133
You don't send the first draft
of the first chapter.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.302
I don't know why I did it.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.842
[sighs]

14:10.449 --> 14:15.086
Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.988
- Are you a good person?

14:16.990 --> 14:17.989
- What?

14:17.991 --> 14:19.591
- Do you consider yourself

14:19.593 --> 14:21.159
A good person?

14:21.161 --> 14:23.061
- No.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.963
- No?
- No.

14:24.965 --> 14:28.566
No, I don't believe there are
good people and bad people.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.336
I mean, yeah,
there's rapists, sociopaths,

14:31.338 --> 14:33.104
But beyond that,

14:33.106 --> 14:37.108
I think we're all
just doing our best to get by.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.244
- [sighs]

14:39.246 --> 14:41.512
I've never cheated on helen.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.248
I mean, it's not that
I haven't wanted to.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.016
Of course I have.
I just...

14:45.018 --> 14:49.254
I could never convince myself
it was worth it.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.055
- What do you want me
to say, noah,

14:51.057 --> 14:54.125
That I'm worth it?

14:54.127 --> 14:57.662
I'm probably not.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.964
- Do you have an open
relationship with your husband?

14:59.966 --> 15:01.566
- No, definitely not.

15:01.568 --> 15:05.570
- You ever cheated on him?
- No.

15:05.572 --> 15:09.908
- So why me?
Why--why now?

15:09.910 --> 15:11.542
- I don't know.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.344
You've got a nice ass.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.379
- [laughs]

15:14.381 --> 15:17.548
[cell phone ringing]

15:20.953 --> 15:23.321
- Why you?

15:23.323 --> 15:24.956
[ringing continues]

15:24.958 --> 15:27.492
I like you.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.962
I like everything about you.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.631
I like the way you talk.
I like the way you think.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.134
I don't even care
what you're saying.

15:36.136 --> 15:40.071
I just like listening to you.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.677
And...

15:45.679 --> 15:49.013
I like it when you touch me.

15:54.353 --> 15:59.424
I want to know what it feels
like to be underneath you.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.060
[chuckles]

16:02.062 --> 16:06.564
I'm sorry.
I'm terrible at this.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.267
[cell phone ringing]

16:09.269 --> 16:11.302
Do you need to get that?
- Yeah.

16:11.304 --> 16:15.406
[ringing continues]

16:15.408 --> 16:18.042
Hello?

16:18.044 --> 16:22.380
No, no, I'm on--
I'm on block island.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.115
I did tell you.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.217
There's a lighthouse here
I wanted to check out

16:26.219 --> 16:28.720
For my research.

16:28.722 --> 16:32.256
What do you mean
she's acting strange?

16:32.258 --> 16:33.458
I don't know, helen.

16:33.460 --> 16:37.362
I think your mom's
always strange.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.197
Well, do you think she's sick?

16:39.199 --> 16:43.134
So take her to the hospital.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.471
Helen, I'm on block island.
What do you want me to do?

16:49.742 --> 16:51.642
Uh, the ferry doesn't leave
till 5:00.

16:51.644 --> 16:55.313
I'll be home, 6:30, okay?

16:55.315 --> 16:58.483
Okay.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.285
Yeah, I love you too.

17:01.287 --> 17:05.656
We'll figure it out
when I get home, okay?

17:05.658 --> 17:07.225
Bye.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.655
- Coming here was your idea.
- I know.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.824
- Whenever you're ready.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.165
- Where you going?

17:49.268 --> 17:50.701
Hey.

17:56.341 --> 17:59.243
Hey! Wait!

18:03.449 --> 18:04.649
- When's the next ferry leave?

18:04.651 --> 18:05.716
- There's a ferry
for connecticut

18:05.718 --> 18:06.818
Leaving in five minutes.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.152
- Perfect.
I'll get on it.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.153
Here.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.688
- What are you doing?

18:10.690 --> 18:14.158
- I'm leaving.
- But...

18:14.160 --> 18:15.760
How are you gonna get home
from connecticut?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.195
- I'll work it out.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.496
- Stop.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.631
Stop it.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.568
This is complicated
for me, alison.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.169
I realize it all seems
pretty simple to you,

18:25.171 --> 18:27.605
But I try to live my life
above board.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.773
If I have sex with you, then--

18:28.775 --> 18:31.342
- <i>If</i> you have sex with me?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.544
Whose--whose hand was
in my underwear last week?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.713
- Well, that's not
the same thing.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.181
- Of course it is.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.283
- Okay, okay, okay.
Maybe it is.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.418
But--

18:40.420 --> 18:43.187
But maybe...

18:43.189 --> 18:44.622
Maybe I'm having
second thoughts.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.591
Can we just--can we just
sit down for a moment?

18:46.593 --> 18:48.593
Let me explain to you.
- No.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.161
- What do you mean no?

18:50.163 --> 18:51.496
- I don't want to be
your test case, noah,

18:51.498 --> 18:52.697
So you can prove to yourself

18:52.699 --> 18:54.332
Just how much
you love your wife.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.867
I want you.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.769
I've made that very clear,
and I thought you wanted me too.

18:58.771 --> 19:03.508
If you want a research partner,
go find someone else.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.643
- You really want to go
to connecticut?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.278
[ferry horn blares]

19:07.280 --> 19:10.314
- I've got a cousin
in new london.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.150
She'll drive me home.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.752
- Okay.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.921
See you around, alison.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.369
Hello?

20:05.371 --> 20:06.938
- Oh, can I help you?

20:06.940 --> 20:09.273
- Yeah, I was hoping
to take a look around.

20:09.275 --> 20:14.579
Let me just find the maps
to the museum.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.781
- I think we have
a mutual friend--

20:16.783 --> 20:19.317
Alison,
alison lockhart.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.851
- How do you know alison?

20:20.853 --> 20:25.289
- Oh, we just met.
She's a...

20:25.291 --> 20:26.557
She's a friend of my wife's.

20:26.559 --> 20:30.261
- Where did they meet?

20:30.263 --> 20:33.965
- [laughs]
I could never understand yoga.

20:33.967 --> 20:37.568
In my day, if you wanted to
twist yourself into a pretzel,

20:37.570 --> 20:39.437
You got into bed with someone.

20:39.439 --> 20:43.241
You didn't lie on a mat and
stick your heinie in the air.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.709
You ask me,

20:44.711 --> 20:47.245
The reason people are
so miserable nowadays is

20:47.247 --> 20:51.983
Because they're all doing yoga
when they should be having sex.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.619
Right, well, fuck the maps.

20:54.621 --> 20:58.756
Uh, the museum
is not that large.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.725
Go right through there.
- Thank you.

21:00.727 --> 21:01.993
What do I, uh--
what do I owe you?

21:01.995 --> 21:03.461
- Oh, nothing.
Nothing.

No, no, no, no,

I'm on block island.
I'm doing some research.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.872
You did?

What do you think?

22:26.745 --> 22:29.547
Oh, that's great.

No, I-I know
they were a little rough,

22:31.718 --> 22:35.853

to get a sense of the--

you just missed your wife.

just a minute ago.

what we have available.

You're in luck.

We've got a cancellation.

for $250.

- I understand.

- You still want to do this?

- Yes.

- We don't know anything
about each other.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.627
- Well, let's keep it
that way.

- I could be wanted
in four states.

- [chuckles]
I'll take my chances.

- Sure.

you're not much of a cuddler.

- Are you okay?

29:39.812 --> 29:42.012
- I'm fine.

- You seem a little upset.
- No, I'm just--

29:45.117 --> 29:48.519
It's just--it's just kind of
stuffy in here, isn't it?

[shutters open]

Is that better?

Pick up, come on.

Oh, damn it.

I'm at the fucking police
station being interrogated.

- Take your time.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.392

I met my wife
in a parking lot--

31:05.030 --> 31:06.230
True story.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.999
She put a dent in my bumper,

31:09.001 --> 31:11.268
And the rest is history.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.973
- How long
have you been married?

31:15.975 --> 31:19.476
- 25 years, and we still act
like we're newlyweds.

31:19.478 --> 31:23.113
- Hmm.
That's beautiful, detective.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.352
- Shall we?

31:28.354 --> 31:30.520
- Yeah, just...

31:48.239 --> 31:52.209
How'd you learn to swim?

31:52.211 --> 31:56.513
- Uh, there was a lake
in the town where I grew up.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.115
- Where was that?

31:58.117 --> 32:00.117
- Western pennsylvania--

32:00.119 --> 32:02.219
Little town called st. George.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.553
- Is that amish country?

32:03.555 --> 32:06.089
- Coal, actually.
Well, not anymore.

32:06.091 --> 32:10.994
Now they're all fracking and
lighting their faucets on fire,

32:10.996 --> 32:12.296
I think.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.398
I haven't been back
in a while.

32:14.400 --> 32:18.101
- So you still
have family there?

32:18.103 --> 32:20.037
- I do...

32:20.039 --> 32:22.172
My father.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.341
Why do you ask?

32:26.277 --> 32:29.446
- What kind of lake was it?

32:31.983 --> 32:33.250
- A wet one.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.352
- Was it cold?

32:35.354 --> 32:37.421
- Yes.

32:37.423 --> 32:40.290
- Was it big?

32:40.292 --> 32:42.492
- Not particularly.

32:42.494 --> 32:46.263
- How old were you?

32:46.265 --> 32:48.065
- Uh...

32:48.067 --> 32:51.401
I don't know.
I guess I was pretty young.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.205
- Well, they, um,

32:55.207 --> 32:58.675
They say
this beach is haunted.

33:01.512 --> 33:04.715
You see
where it gets dark suddenly?

33:04.717 --> 33:06.516
It looks like a whirlpool--

33:06.518 --> 33:09.052
Right out there,
about 100 yards out.

33:09.054 --> 33:09.686
- Yeah.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.421
- It's a shipwreck.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.591
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.594
This island is famous
for them.

33:17.596 --> 33:21.732
- Huh. Seems like
such a pleasant place.

33:23.267 --> 33:27.070
- They say if you, um...

33:27.072 --> 33:30.674
If you listen closely
to the wind...

33:30.676 --> 33:32.476
You can hear
the sound of a little boy

33:32.478 --> 33:35.679
Who died on the ship
calling for his mother.

33:37.715 --> 33:39.716
- Jesus.

33:46.357 --> 33:49.559
- There's no wind today.

33:53.731 --> 33:57.634
I've--I've heard it before.

33:57.636 --> 34:01.371
You don't have to believe me,
but I have.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.508
- No, I believe you.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.544
I still hear
my mother's voice.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.713
I still talk to her.

34:12.383 --> 34:13.784
It started
right after she died.

34:13.786 --> 34:16.753
I...

34:16.755 --> 34:19.790
I'd be on my way to school
or going to sleep at night,

34:19.792 --> 34:23.126
And...

34:23.128 --> 34:25.128
I'd hear her.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.531
- What does she say?

34:27.533 --> 34:28.799
- That's the crazy thing.

34:28.801 --> 34:33.203
I don't know
what she's saying.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.638
I hear her voice,

34:34.640 --> 34:38.742
And I know she's trying
to tell me something, but...

34:38.744 --> 34:42.712
They're just sounds, not words.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.182
It's like she's...

34:45.184 --> 34:50.287
Speaking in the language
of the dead...

34:50.289 --> 34:53.290
And I can't understand it.

34:57.662 --> 35:02.532
I think she's saying
something like, uh...

35:02.534 --> 35:05.102
"let it go"?

35:09.407 --> 35:13.577
It sounds a little like
"let it go."

35:36.300 --> 35:39.636
I can't work you out.
- [chuckles]

35:45.643 --> 35:47.410
- It's about an hour
before the boat leaves.

35:47.412 --> 35:51.615
Are there any other
incredibly depressing places

35:51.617 --> 35:52.916
You want to tour
before we go?

35:52.918 --> 35:54.885
- No.
- I mean, an old graveyard or...

35:54.887 --> 35:56.620
There's an old gallows
in town.

35:56.622 --> 35:59.756
You want to check it out?
- Screw you.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.492
- Now, that's
a much better idea.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.861
- [laughs]

36:04.863 --> 36:06.863
Ah!

36:19.544 --> 36:21.244
- You didn't come last time,
did you?

36:21.246 --> 36:24.281
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.782
I want to make you come.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.417
Is there a trick?
- A trick?

36:27.419 --> 36:29.519
- Yeah, like some secret thing
that turns you on?

36:29.521 --> 36:32.389
- What, like something kinky?

36:32.391 --> 36:33.523
- Is there?

36:33.525 --> 36:34.791
- No.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.426
Are you sure we have time?

36:36.428 --> 36:37.928
- Fuck time.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.263
- If we miss the last ferry,
we'll have to sleep here.

36:40.265 --> 36:41.565
- Yes, let's fucking
sleep here.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.233
- And what about your family?

36:43.235 --> 36:44.701
Don't you have some kind
of emergency you got to go to?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.336
- In my family,
there's always an emergency

36:46.338 --> 36:48.905
And therefore
never an emergency.

36:50.408 --> 36:53.510
Let me do that.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.545
I love doing that.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.880
Oh, yeah.
- [laughs]

36:56.882 --> 36:59.316
- One-handed.
Still got it.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.322
- [laughs]
- relax.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.357
- It tickles.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.707
- What's this?

37:23.709 --> 37:26.443
- Oh, no.
Nothing.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.578
We haven't got time.
We have to go.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.880
- Wait a second.
Alison--

37:30.882 --> 37:32.849
- Can you hand me my dress?
- Not yet--

37:32.851 --> 37:36.019
- Hand me my fucking dress,
please.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.438
- Okay, did I just do
something wrong?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.674
- No.

38:00.444 --> 38:01.845
- Tell me.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.014
- I'm fine.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.785
- I don't understand
what just happened.

38:08.787 --> 38:09.886
- What just happened
is you fucked someone

38:09.888 --> 38:10.987
Who isn't your wife, noah.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.022
That's what happened.

38:12.024 --> 38:13.590
That's what you did wrong.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.425
If you want to apologize
to someone,

38:15.427 --> 38:17.327
Go and apologize to her.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.529
- How'd you get those scars
on your leg?

38:24.935 --> 38:26.636
You can trust me, alison.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.538
- Trust you?

38:28.540 --> 38:30.807
Are you insane?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.042
Why would I do that?

38:32.044 --> 38:33.643
You're a married man
with four kids

38:33.645 --> 38:37.447
Who's cheating on his wife.

38:37.449 --> 38:40.450
- Fuck!
[kicks dresser]

38:46.657 --> 38:49.626
[door opens and slams]

38:49.628 --> 38:51.795
- Fuck.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.776
[sighs]
shit.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.345
[door opens]

39:10.748 --> 39:12.015
- [grunts]

39:16.620 --> 39:17.887
Get on the other end of this.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.957
- Why? What--
- just do it, okay?

39:20.959 --> 39:23.593
Please.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.762
- What are we doing?
- On the count of three, ready?

39:25.764 --> 39:27.564
We push.
One, two, three, go.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.631
Push.
- [groans]

39:28.633 --> 39:30.934
- Please.

39:32.103 --> 39:34.537
- Where are we going?
- Shh.

39:34.539 --> 39:38.074
The maid's cleaning the floor.
She left the room open.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.076
Here.

39:42.713 --> 39:45.115
Push.

39:45.117 --> 39:47.851
- [sighs]
you got to be kidding me.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.452
- Come on.

39:49.454 --> 39:50.653
- No.

39:50.655 --> 39:51.921
- Why not?

39:51.923 --> 39:53.556
- What about the people
who stayed here?

39:53.558 --> 39:54.791
- They've left already.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.659
- No, they'll be charged
for the damage.

39:56.661 --> 39:59.095
- Look, I haven't got any cash
to pay for the damage.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.463
Helen checks
the credit card statements.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.031
So, unless you want
to pay for it,

40:02.033 --> 40:03.400
Will you please help me
get this thing out of the room

40:03.402 --> 40:04.868
Before the fucking maid
comes back?

40:04.870 --> 40:09.172
- [sighs]
- come on.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.774
- Ow.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.609
[both grunt]

40:16.747 --> 40:18.915
- Oh, fuck it.

40:22.887 --> 40:26.022
- Ah. Ow.
- Push.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.892
- Whoa.
[laughter]

40:28.894 --> 40:31.461
- Shh.
- Shh.

40:38.769 --> 40:40.470
- There.

40:40.472 --> 40:41.805
Perfect.

40:41.807 --> 40:44.941
Nice work, bonnie.
Let's go.

41:10.968 --> 41:15.238
[ferry horn blares]

41:22.680 --> 41:25.181
- I'm sorry.

41:25.183 --> 41:27.984
I didn't mean those things
that I said.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.623
- They were true.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.758
- Okay, well, I...

41:35.760 --> 41:37.861
I didn't mean to say them.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.964
- [chuckles]

41:40.966 --> 41:42.966
- We should end this...

41:42.968 --> 41:45.001
Here, now.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.836
You know, we've had
such a nice day,

41:46.838 --> 41:51.174
And we should just leave it
in a good place, okay?

41:57.014 --> 41:59.883
- If that's what you want.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.519
- Look, I-I-I know
what you think you see.

42:02.521 --> 42:04.120
- Tell me.
- Well, some easygoing girl

42:04.122 --> 42:06.523
Who's gonna shake you up
with her free spirit,

42:06.525 --> 42:09.225
So by the end of the summer,
you can go back home

42:09.227 --> 42:14.264
To your boring life
with a bounce in your step.

42:14.266 --> 42:16.065
- Well, I wish you'd at least
give me the chance

42:16.067 --> 42:17.267
To disappoint you.

42:17.269 --> 42:19.302
- Yeah, well,
I'm not that girl.

42:19.304 --> 42:23.072
And I won't rescue you
from anything.

42:23.074 --> 42:26.009
You're gonna be sorry
you ever met me.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.677
We just leave it here, okay?

42:27.679 --> 42:29.579
You got to have your little
adventure, and I got to--

42:29.581 --> 42:31.648
- Okay, just stop it.
Just stop talking, all right?

42:31.650 --> 42:33.182
You're making me sick.

42:33.184 --> 42:35.752
- Well, what do you think
happens now?

42:35.754 --> 42:37.153
- What do you want from me?

42:37.155 --> 42:38.922
Some kind of promise
that I'll divorce my wife?

42:38.924 --> 42:40.156
- Of course not.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.558
- Are you planning
on leaving your husband?

42:41.560 --> 42:45.161
- No.
- Then why are we even arguing?

42:45.163 --> 42:47.630
I don't know what the hell
happened back there,

42:47.632 --> 42:49.299
But let me make
one thing very clear.

42:49.301 --> 42:52.602
There is nothing about you
that seems easy.

42:52.604 --> 42:54.137
And whatever darkness
you think you're hiding,

42:54.139 --> 42:56.172
It's written all over
your fucking face.

42:56.174 --> 42:57.774
And you know what?

42:57.776 --> 43:00.209
I kind of like it.

43:52.863 --> 43:56.032
- [sighs]

44:28.298 --> 44:31.668
[engine turning over,
car doors closing]

44:43.681 --> 44:46.683
[car horn honks]

44:51.055 --> 44:53.222
- Damn it.

44:59.263 --> 45:04.333
- You forgot
my wife's birthday?

45:04.335 --> 45:06.836
- Ha.

45:08.305 --> 45:11.941
- So that's it, then?
Just see you around?

45:17.247 --> 45:20.316
I had a nice time today.

45:22.853 --> 45:25.755
And sorry I was clumsy or...

45:29.093 --> 45:30.727
I...

45:30.729 --> 45:35.465
It meant something to me,
being there with you.

45:35.467 --> 45:39.335
I just wanted you to know that.

45:41.105 --> 45:44.173
Thank you for taking me there.

45:54.184 --> 45:56.753
- [voice breaking]
damn it.

45:59.123 --> 46:02.058
- Alison, why are you shaking?

46:02.060 --> 46:03.459
Come on, I'll drive you home.

46:03.461 --> 46:04.994
- No.
- Yes, yes.

46:04.996 --> 46:06.863
Come on, you're a mess.
Let me just make sure

46:06.865 --> 46:10.533
You get home okay, and you
don't have to say a word to me.

46:10.535 --> 46:14.203
Then at least I'll have done
one decent thing today.

46:14.205 --> 46:17.240
Come on.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.408
Don't give me that face.

46:22.379 --> 46:24.881
Come on, get in the car.

46:57.347 --> 46:59.015
- I had a son.

47:07.558 --> 47:10.593
- "had"?

47:10.595 --> 47:12.829
- He drowned.

47:17.201 --> 47:19.368
- Oh, god.

47:40.991 --> 47:43.559
[sighs]

47:43.561 --> 47:47.096
When?

47:47.098 --> 47:50.099
- Two years ago.

47:50.101 --> 47:53.903
- [sighs]

47:53.905 --> 47:56.973
How old was he?

47:56.975 --> 48:00.042
- Four.

48:00.044 --> 48:02.245
He'd be six now.

48:02.247 --> 48:05.314
He'd be learning to read.

48:07.351 --> 48:09.518
- What was his name?

48:12.956 --> 48:14.891
- Gabriel.

48:22.332 --> 48:24.500
- What was he like?

48:30.040 --> 48:31.307
- He...

48:31.309 --> 48:34.443
He was perfect.

48:34.445 --> 48:36.512
God, he had these...

48:36.514 --> 48:40.616
He had these wide,
green eyes...

48:40.618 --> 48:43.152
And he thought
everything was funny.

48:43.154 --> 48:44.654
[laughs]

48:44.656 --> 48:48.024
He never wanted to be
left out of a joke.

48:50.994 --> 48:54.196
When I wake up,

48:54.198 --> 48:57.266
Before I open my eyes, I...

48:57.268 --> 49:00.002
I listen for his laugh...

49:00.004 --> 49:03.139
Because I'd gotten
so used to hearing it, you know?

49:03.141 --> 49:05.408
That's how every morning started
for so long.

49:05.410 --> 49:07.410
I'd wake up,

49:07.412 --> 49:10.413
And he'd be standing there
at the bed,

49:10.415 --> 49:13.516
Looking at me and laughing.

49:13.518 --> 49:17.687
He thought it was so funny
that grown-ups sleep too.

49:22.426 --> 49:24.327
Now when I open my eyes,

49:24.329 --> 49:28.164
My house is so quiet.

49:28.166 --> 49:32.568
Cole has this tattoo on his back
of the angel gabriel.

49:32.570 --> 49:35.104
It's the first thing I see
every fucking morning,

49:35.106 --> 49:38.641
And it all comes rushing back,
and I want to die.

49:46.350 --> 49:49.218
- I'm so sorry.

49:51.321 --> 49:54.056
- So now you know.

49:54.058 --> 49:59.128
I cut myself once in a while
because it makes me feel better.

50:05.602 --> 50:08.771
I'll understand
if I never see you again.

50:22.619 --> 50:25.021
- I'll take you home.

50:30.560 --> 50:33.662
[engine turning over]

50:41.204 --> 50:42.772
Where is cole?

50:42.774 --> 50:46.042
- He went to syracuse
to pick up a new horse.

50:46.044 --> 50:49.111
He won't be back
till tomorrow night.

51:01.324 --> 51:03.426
Uh, I need my bike.
[chuckles]

51:03.428 --> 51:04.727
- Right.

51:04.729 --> 51:06.729
Idiot.

51:25.415 --> 51:27.516
Right here?

51:27.518 --> 51:29.685
- Thanks.

51:40.764 --> 51:43.599
Noah...

51:43.601 --> 51:45.501
Thank you...

51:45.503 --> 51:48.537
For today.

51:48.539 --> 51:50.239
I'm--I'm sorry if I--

51:50.241 --> 51:52.308
- No, no, no.

51:52.310 --> 51:54.343
Don't apologize.

51:59.616 --> 52:02.418
- Can I ask you something?

52:02.420 --> 52:05.321
- Anything.

52:05.323 --> 52:07.356
- What do you see now...

52:07.358 --> 52:10.192
When you look at me?

52:14.731 --> 52:17.266
- What do you think I see?

52:21.304 --> 52:23.305
- Death.

52:26.610 --> 52:29.812
- No.

52:31.214 --> 52:33.349
- What do you see, then?

52:51.368 --> 52:55.437
You don't want this.

52:55.439 --> 52:59.308
- Alison, I'm a grown man.
I know what I want.

53:30.807 --> 53:34.210
[both breathing heavily]

53:50.327 --> 53:52.561
Look at me.

53:52.563 --> 53:56.765
Look at me.

53:56.767 --> 53:58.934
Look at me.

54:39.776 --> 54:42.945
[both moaning]
