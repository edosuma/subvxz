WEBVTT

00:14.515 --> 00:15.848
When?

00:15.933 --> 00:17.684
After breakfast.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.728
You want the lights down so
much, why don't you do it yourself?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.314
I put them up there.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.942
You have got to learn to mutter quieter,
'cause I heard that.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.777
That was the point!

00:36.078 --> 00:38.079
What the heck?

00:38.163 --> 00:40.081
Dear Lord!

00:59.685 --> 01:01.352
Sherman?

01:01.437 --> 01:02.812
Call the police!

01:02.896 --> 01:04.438
What is that?

01:04.522 --> 01:06.774
Well, sure as shit it ain't Santa Claus.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.241
Phone's ringing, Raylan.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.286
Thank you, Donny.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.412
Donny?

01:20.038 --> 01:22.290
It's from Lebowski. Netflix it.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.917
You can be one of the cool kids. Givens.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.253
Deputy Givens, this is Sharon Edmunds.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.756
- I do bail bonds in Knoxville.
- Okay.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.426
We met at a law enforcement
expo in Miami a few years ago.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.137
You want another one.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.390
Not of that.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.852
Oh. I'm sorry. I remember you.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.355
We had a drink.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.733
Several. From my mini-bar.

01:49.109 --> 01:53.821
I believe I also remember
you polished off a $20 tin of macadamia nuts.

01:53.906 --> 01:57.074
Yes. The most overrated of the nuts.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.869
Is that why you're calling?
Want me to pay my fair share?

02:00.245 --> 02:02.663
No, I like it better you owing me.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.000
But this isn't a personal call, Raylan.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.044
I saw you're with
the Eastern District of Kentucky now.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.172
I need a hand up there.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.590
You interested?

02:13.258 --> 02:14.425
I haven't hung up.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.638
Jody Adair, 41,
charged with double homicide,

02:18.722 --> 02:21.808
out on a quarter-million bail,
skipped town two days ago.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.185
He's got an ex-wife in Lexington.

02:24.269 --> 02:28.272
You put eyes on him,
I get Lexington PD to haul him in,

02:29.191 --> 02:30.650
and I'll make it worth your while.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.860
Meaning?

02:33.195 --> 02:34.445
How about three grand?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.198
Send me the address and a photograph.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.741
All right.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.999
You think you can manage the phones?

02:47.626 --> 02:48.918
I'm gonna go out for a bit.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.086
Where you going?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.754
Oh, I got a thing.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.714
Don't get caught, dude.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.675
Anything I should know?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.760
No. No.

02:57.845 --> 03:02.306
Just a major prison break, the countryside's
been overrun with fugitives.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.724
I got it.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.782
You show up before dawn
with a bag of hamburgers?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.993
They get the toys that way.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.286
Come on, now. Let me in.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.745
Hell, no.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.874
Why not?
You let me in every other time I come by.

03:34.756 --> 03:35.798
No.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.681
Hey, Sharon. It's Raylan.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.850
Yeah, he's here. Listen...

03:46.727 --> 03:47.768
Hold up.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.687
You dropped something.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.938
Pick it up if you want.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.401
Asshole.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.194
No, not you.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.288
Won't let me in?

04:07.372 --> 04:10.291
Oh, yeah, I think you're gonna let me in.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.962
You can have the burgers if you want.

04:17.841 --> 04:18.841
Shit!

04:19.593 --> 04:21.177
Let's go. Out.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.513
Mine's bigger than yours...

04:24.640 --> 04:28.225
Big enough to throw
a bullet through this door and you, as well.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.519
Before I put one through your ear?

04:30.646 --> 04:32.480
You think this is
the first time I had a gun pointed at me?

04:32.564 --> 04:33.898
No.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.232
Could be your last, though.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.817
I'm guessing you know who I am.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.113
I can guess who you are,
or at least which team you play for,

04:41.198 --> 04:43.366
all of which indicates
you're not gonna shoot me.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.534
No, I ain't.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.869
There you go.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.522
Sharon?

05:15.774 --> 05:17.733
How much I just bring him in?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.896
So, you really have been saved.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.858
By the Lord almighty
and the word of his forgiveness.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.401
So, what happened?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.903
You sit down
and start reading the Good Book?

06:03.947 --> 06:08.492
Or was there a human component
involved in this soul saving?

06:11.163 --> 06:12.997
I got to be honest now, Boyd.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.417
A lot of times, the way you say things,
I can't make hide nor hair.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.128
Well, were you saved
on your own or in a church, Hiram?

06:19.421 --> 06:21.797
Church. Last Chance Holiness.

06:22.966 --> 06:23.966
Well, that's new to me.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.843
I don't believe
I've ever heard of that collection plate.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.094
It's new to Harlan.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.679
Well, right now it's just a tent in the woods.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.140
But Preacher Billy, he's the real deal, Boyd.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.767
Old-school.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.770
Been healing lots of the afflicted. Addicts.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.980
That's why your oxy sales
have dropped off a cliff,

06:38.106 --> 06:40.858
'cause people
getting off drugs, getting hooked on Jesus.

06:42.027 --> 06:46.363
Well, Hiram, receiving
the Lord into your heart is a wonderful thing.

06:46.490 --> 06:49.533
But I do have to ask,
when did your salvation occur?

06:49.659 --> 06:50.826
Last week.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.328
Well, then, there you go.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.163
What we have is a problem of arithmetics,

06:54.289 --> 06:57.625
'cause you received
a shipment of oxy from us three weeks ago.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.711
Now, that gives you two solid weeks of
selling before you saw the light.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.881
Now, by my count, Hiram,

07:04.007 --> 07:07.009
you got at least $10,000 of my money.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.678
I don't. I stopped selling before then.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.263
Well, then give me my oxy back.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.725
Can't. I flushed that poison down the shitter.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.103
Poison?

07:17.187 --> 07:19.063
Why, you don't know your scripture.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.858
"He makes wine that gladdens the
hearts of man." Psalms 104.

07:23.235 --> 07:27.363
And what are our goods
but modern-day wine, albeit in a pill form?

07:27.489 --> 07:31.659
That's just you twisting
the word of God for your own dark purposes.

07:32.828 --> 07:33.869
Where you going?

07:33.995 --> 07:35.162
I'm getting away from the window.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.095
Now, Hiram, saved or not,

07:51.471 --> 07:54.974
you don't have my money
by the time tomorrow night rolls around,

07:55.058 --> 07:58.144
the next firecracker's gonna go off in here.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.958
Hey!

08:21.209 --> 08:23.419
Shut that off before anyone sees the light.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.760
What are you doing?

08:32.386 --> 08:34.722
Might as well pull some wire while we're at it.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.765
Got to love these old places.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.602
$20 copper right here.

08:45.609 --> 08:46.901
What is that?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.778
Well, let's pull and find out.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.616
Shit!

08:57.662 --> 08:58.704
What do we do?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.748
We run, you dumb shit.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.966
Hey! I got dogs here!

09:11.092 --> 09:14.261
They're gonna rip your face off!
Trained them to do it!

09:14.638 --> 09:16.180
God damn it!

09:30.278 --> 09:34.031
Can't be local,
or you'd have identified yourself as such.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.702
Maybe you're federal.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.288
No bounty hunters allowed
in the state of Kentucky.

09:41.373 --> 09:45.000
If you're gonna keep talking,
I'm gonna put you in the trunk.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.505
Can I ask you something?

09:49.714 --> 09:50.798
What's that?

09:50.882 --> 09:52.967
It mean anything to you
that I ain't never had no priors?

09:53.051 --> 09:55.803
Nope. That ain't none of my business.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.513
I just came to see my kids.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.640
She wouldn't let me see them.
Can you fathom that?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.558
- You got kids?
- Yeah.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.689
Do you get visitation?

10:07.983 --> 10:09.024
Visitation.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.485
Sure, just Sundays, and supervised,

10:11.569 --> 10:14.697
on account of
I ain't have a place suitable for children.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.407
One of the reasons
I moved on down to Knoxville.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.242
I ain't gonna see them. Why stick around?

10:18.368 --> 10:19.368
Hold on.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.744
Only reason I'm in this jackpot

10:20.870 --> 10:21.954
was trying to get money for my kids.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.872
Okay, I need you to be quiet now.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.208
- Hello?
- Hey, Raylan.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.668
Yeah, look, it's Bob.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.170
Constable Bob Sweeney
down in Harlan, yeah.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.423
Look, I'm at your daddy's house.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.717
Well, is it on fire?

10:34.843 --> 10:37.720
Only reason I can imagine
you calling before dawn.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.222
Oh, shit.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.016
I think my arm's falling asleep.

10:42.559 --> 10:43.892
Stop talking.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.894
- I'm headed up that way.
- Stop talking?

10:46.021 --> 10:48.063
- I'm not gonna stop talking. Hey, look.
- I can stop by there.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.399
- You don't need to do that.
- You gonna have to turn me in unharmed,

10:50.525 --> 10:52.234
- or you gonna catch some shit.
- Okay, then.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.237
- Shit!
- See you there.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.281
You know what your problem is?

10:57.907 --> 10:59.700
You got no self-awareness.

10:59.784 --> 11:04.163
You think trying to do right by your children
excuses everything, even killing men.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.165
They were heroin dealers.
If they'd just give up their money,

11:06.249 --> 11:07.583
none of this would have happened.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.209
Any problem, that's someone else's fault.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.377
You ever hear of the saying,

11:10.462 --> 11:13.589
"You run into an asshole
in the morning, you ran into an asshole.

11:13.965 --> 11:17.593
"You run into assholes all day,
you're the asshole"?

11:19.137 --> 11:20.262
What?

11:20.555 --> 11:22.264
This could be a little uncomfortable.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.557
Just be cool and go with it.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.977
I get out of these,
I'll tear you to pieces small enough to flush.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.399
Morning, sunshine.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.942
Look what I got for my girl.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.277
What is it?

11:35.445 --> 11:37.613
Well, open it and find out.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.908
You do that? With the paper?

11:40.992 --> 11:42.451
Watched a video on YouTube.

11:42.911 --> 11:43.994
Here.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.287
Wait, is it oxy?

11:45.622 --> 11:47.164
No. Better.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.792
Not meth. I can't do any more of that.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.419
It's not meth. It's mellow.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.840
Oh, my God. Is this real?

11:56.966 --> 11:58.008
What?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.178
No, honey, there ain't no such
thing as a million dollar bill.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.056
- Are you sure?
- It's from a church.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.266
Got some religious screed on the other side.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.477
Some kids were
handing them out by the Stop 'n Go.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.188
I thought it was funny, using it as I did.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.857
Now, I got another surprise for you,

12:13.983 --> 12:16.110
but you're gonna have
to keep your eyes shut for that one.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.694
I can't wait.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.329
Keep them closed.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.207
They're closed.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.127
All right, now...

12:33.378 --> 12:34.628
Open!

12:47.517 --> 12:49.268
Look at that, they busted the hinges.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.271
Still broke the lock.
Would have been cheaper to break a window.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.814
You should put a sign up...

12:53.898 --> 12:56.984
"You thinking of breaking in,
please break a window.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.193
"Thank you. The management."

12:58.319 --> 13:00.070
You just happened to be driving by?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.905
No, I put a motion detector in.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.740
Sends me a text every time it goes off.

13:03.867 --> 13:04.908
How much is that costing me?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.578
It's in your bill. I'm not hiding it.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.415
Well, I ain't gonna cover
that up with the smell of baking cookies.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.667
I'll tell you what, though...

13:13.751 --> 13:15.544
Those wire-strippers are lucky.

13:15.670 --> 13:20.257
If I'd caught them, would have opened
a Costco-sized can of whup-ass on them.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.135
I guess I can fix the door.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.053
Can you hire someone to handle this?

13:25.513 --> 13:28.098
I can. You know, Raylan...

13:28.266 --> 13:30.100
I've been thinking.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.395
I'm gonna tell you something
I haven't told a whole lot of people.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.231
About that time you
were in high school, living in Florida?

13:36.608 --> 13:37.858
How'd you know that?

13:37.942 --> 13:40.527
Kid on the football team
came at you at shop class.

13:40.612 --> 13:41.778
You took him out with a hammer.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.864
Ollie Kemp. I tell you this before?

13:43.948 --> 13:47.159
Once during senior year
when we were down at the lake.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.285
Was I drunk?

13:48.411 --> 13:49.620
I think we all were.

13:49.746 --> 13:53.749
Then again two months ago
when I hired you to watch this house.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.251
What's that?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.129
I have not a clue.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.092
Ollie Kemp. That was the guy.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.887
Size of a portable toilet.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.306
He come at me,
and I just went berserker red on him.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.725
Put him in a coma.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.685
He's still in it, as far as I know.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.730
That's why your family
moved to Evarts, if I'm not mistaken.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.235
What is that?

14:21.319 --> 14:24.112
It's a driver's license. Waldo Truth.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.324
Yeah, I know it's a joke.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.575
What's that?

14:28.660 --> 14:31.078
Being a constable. You got to run for it.

14:31.162 --> 14:35.207
You only get $2,400 a year
if you win, so nobody runs for it.

14:35.291 --> 14:40.128
Got to have your own car.
Got to have your own everything.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.672
I had to pay for these lights myself.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.799
$2,400 enough to live on?

14:43.925 --> 14:46.426
Well, I get $50 apiece for serving papers.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.722
State police got to charge $80,
so everyone comes to me.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.268
You know, let them keep thinking I'm a joke.
That's what I say.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.978
They underestimate me at their peril.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.521
Just ask Ollie Kemp.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.314
If he could respond.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.609
Let me tell you something, Raylan.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.529
If shit gets serious, you give me a call,

15:06.030 --> 15:08.657
and I'll grab my go bag and be ready to jump.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.909
Will do, Bob.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.661
You stay frosty.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.254
All right. Here's the deal.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.547
I got to do one more thing.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.716
Stay quiet, I'll let you back up front.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.438
It was a costume.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.189
I know that now.

15:42.025 --> 15:47.029
See, Arnold's a furry.
Usually he dresses up in, like, a bunny suit?

15:47.822 --> 15:49.740
But this one scared me.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.909
Plus I was on drugs,
and it was a good costume.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.078
He gonna press charges?

15:55.204 --> 15:56.913
He's the judge/executive.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.832
What's he gonna do?

15:59.083 --> 16:02.669
Tell everyone he was shot
in a whorehouse wearing a bear costume?

16:05.006 --> 16:06.715
What the hell were you doing with a gun?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.009
Everybody's got a gun.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.677
Why do you have a gun at work?

16:11.554 --> 16:13.096
I been hit.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.474
One of these men beats you, you come to me,

16:15.558 --> 16:17.851
and I'll take care of it, you hear me?

16:18.394 --> 16:20.395
It's not just clients who hit.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.107
Oh, you still griping about that?

16:25.735 --> 16:28.153
Case you forget, I also saved your life.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.155
Yeah, I killed a man for you.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.865
I punched you once.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.409
You think that's something,
you ain't never been beaten.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.746
Look, I know that, Ava. I ain't forget.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.459
It's just sometimes I get real scared...

16:42.960 --> 16:44.461
Jittery and...

16:45.296 --> 16:47.214
When I'm low, I just...

16:49.384 --> 16:51.468
I just feel so low, Ava.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.185
That's why I told you to get off the meth.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.311
Yeah.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.813
No coke, either.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.066
You can't do the jittery stuff, Ellen May.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.734
The come down off that's
worse than anything.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.903
Yeah.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.279
What was it Arnold gave you?

17:11.614 --> 17:16.117
He wouldn't say. Just that it wasn't oxy.

17:19.997 --> 17:23.583
Well, you know there's
gonna be consequences.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.419
- What kind?
- I don't know.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.088
I'll talk to Boyd, and we'll figure it out.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.256
What is this?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.842
It's what Arnold had his drugs in.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.510
It's not real.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.689
Whatever me and Boyd decide,
you can't have a gun at work.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.151
I know that, Ava. I'm sorry.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.537
How's Arlo getting along?
If you don't mind my asking.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.788
He's in prison.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.624
I know.
I was wondering about his mental state.

18:04.709 --> 18:08.295
Well, like I said, Mike, he's in prison.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.338
Raylan, the last time he came in here,

18:10.715 --> 18:14.551
he stood over there
by the paints for five minutes.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.345
Did not move, just staring.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.681
Unnerved the hell out of me.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.020
You know, you see your old man, you say...

18:26.189 --> 18:27.647
Oh, hell.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.525
I have absolutely no idea
what you should say to him.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.278
Well, that's okay, Mike.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.654
I don't plan on seeing him.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.948
That's a good plan.

18:43.706 --> 18:48.835
You know, I've been told
I got a screw loose, but this is just crazy.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.719
You want one?

18:58.054 --> 18:59.304
Want one what?

19:00.223 --> 19:01.973
A screw.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.725
How old are you?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.143
Old enough.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.897
I think I got everything I came for. Thank you.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.484
Mike, you need a cleanup on aisle whatever.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.575
Hey, hold up a sec.

19:21.577 --> 19:22.744
I need your opinion.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.996
How are these?

19:25.832 --> 19:29.251
See, I'm a late bloomer.
I didn't get them till just last year.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.670
Patience is a virtue.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.510
Miss, you can't go out this way.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.678
Well...

19:45.685 --> 19:47.602
Mike, where'd that little girl go?

19:47.687 --> 19:50.355
She just flashed me her
titties then scooted out the back.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.565
Why?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.109
My car's gone.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.450
Well, maybe what Hiram told you is true.

20:02.577 --> 20:06.621
Our drug business is being squeezed
by some backwoods preacher?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.790
I don't buy it.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.960
Maybe it's because the FDA,
they went and changed the formula for oxy...

20:12.086 --> 20:13.295
Makes it harder to get high.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.963
Our supply's from before the change.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.882
And they went down
and changed the laws in Florida.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.049
That hasn't helped much.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.468
You been watching CNN.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.053
I tell you what I haven't been doing,

20:22.138 --> 20:24.306
and that's allowing
one of my whores to shoot a customer.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.892
I'll discuss Ava's failings
when it's her turn in the barrel.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.477
Right now it's Cousin Johnny's time.

20:30.146 --> 20:33.982
Now, all your talk of
the FDA and Florida laws didn't explain

20:34.108 --> 20:37.485
why my oxy sales
have dropped off in my voting district.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.739
And frankly, I'm nonplussed
by your lack of motivation, Johnny,

20:40.823 --> 20:43.450
'cause it ain't just
my bottom line being affected.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.079
All right. I'll check it out.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.588
I got failings?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.757
Well, clearly outweighed by your attributes.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.093
How'd you handle Ellen May?

21:02.428 --> 21:05.180
As much as told her wait till Daddy got home.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.182
All right, well, we'll figure something out.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.101
Confined to quarters, bread and water.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.605
- Who was the john?
- Arnold.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.523
Well, he ain't gonna say nothing to nobody.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.529
No one ever said running a criminal
enterprise was gonna be this hard?

21:21.656 --> 21:24.366
They left that part out on Career Day.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.451
You want a Dr Pepper?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.954
Well, is it 10:00, 2:00, or 4:00?

21:29.872 --> 21:31.706
It is 9:21.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.376
Never too early for a Dr Pepper.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.003
All right. One Dr Pepper.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.850
Thank you.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.062
- Is Boyd in?
- Who?

21:56.565 --> 21:58.400
Boyd Crowder. He in?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.027
Don't know anybody by that name.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.584
Where you from, friend?

22:19.422 --> 22:21.423
Little town in Maryland.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.842
Bel Air.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.386
It's the birthplace of John Wilkes Booth.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.223
Well, what brings you to Harlan County?

22:32.184 --> 22:33.601
Boyd Crowder.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.354
Never heard of him.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.193
I knew this guy.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.112
He used to work with the Military Police,

22:44.196 --> 22:47.115
and he swore,
if you ever ask someone a question like,

22:47.241 --> 22:51.244
"Where are you hiding those drugs?"
You just watch the eyes.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.456
More often than not,
they'll point to the right direction.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.126
Yours, they stayed on the beam.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.919
But Scooter over here...

23:01.380 --> 23:02.881
He just couldn't help himself.

23:05.259 --> 23:08.470
I think your time in this establishment
has come to an end.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.638
I hear you.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.271
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

23:18.731 --> 23:19.981
You need to leave now!

23:20.107 --> 23:22.567
Christ in heaven, you're a beautiful woman.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.652
Jimmy!

23:25.488 --> 23:28.156
Boyd! Boyd!

23:32.495 --> 23:34.746
Ava, Johnny, Jim, let me introduce to you,

23:34.830 --> 23:36.664
all the way from Desert Storm,

23:36.749 --> 23:39.584
by way of the Iraq
and Afghan wars, First Sergeant...

23:39.668 --> 23:41.252
Not any more. Got knocked down.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.339
Sergeant Colton Rhodes, Military Police.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.175
Now, how many times
did you jail my ass in Kuwait?

23:47.301 --> 23:49.010
I say five. Am I low?

23:49.095 --> 23:50.804
Boyd, honestly, I lost count.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.185
- You call the police?
- I called you.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.938
Wait, wait, you said "they" took your car?

24:00.022 --> 24:01.272
Girl flashed me her titties.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.941
I assume it's not a coincidence.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.943
I know that scam.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.444
The female acts as a distraction.

24:06.529 --> 24:07.946
Her colleague steals the vehicle.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.280
It's happening a lot these days.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.167
- Pull on me.
- Pull on you?

24:21.252 --> 24:23.461
Yeah, make like you're going for your gun.
Pull on me.

24:23.546 --> 24:24.587
Bob, I really do need to...

24:24.713 --> 24:26.881
Raylan, just pull on me, man.

24:33.639 --> 24:34.973
Beef stew.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.392
- Wow.
- Yeah.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.477
And I can do it with both hands, too.
Still deadly.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.772
I apply to the State police
next year, they gonna take me.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.315
That bag back there?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.442
- That's your...
- My go bag.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.361
Got everything in there in case I need to go.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.696
Like toilet paper?

24:49.780 --> 24:52.282
God damn it, Raylan, not like toilet paper!

24:52.575 --> 24:54.659
I got a AK-47 with a folding stock,

24:54.743 --> 24:57.287
I got body armour I bought
off a police auction,

24:57.413 --> 24:59.122
I got MREs, I got bottled water.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.541
If this shit goes road warrior, man, I'm ready.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.667
You're gonna come to me.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.379
All right, let's check out the scrapyard first.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.131
Scrapyard? Why?

25:08.257 --> 25:09.632
These metal thieves these days, man,

25:09.758 --> 25:11.301
they sell the cars for scrap.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.136
- Crush them, send them off...
- They crush them?

25:13.596 --> 25:14.846
Yeah, it's 500 bucks a car.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.014
Let's go, Bob, right now.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.182
All right.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.601
- You know, it wouldn't...
- I got shit in the car

25:19.685 --> 25:21.603
I don't want to be crushed.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.271
All right, well, you know, I can use my lights.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.064
- I mean, legally, they don't have any...
- Use them.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.608
Lights going on!

25:44.543 --> 25:47.754
Hey! Crusher man! Crusher man! Stop that!

25:47.838 --> 25:49.547
Stop the thing! Crusher man!

25:49.632 --> 25:50.798
Can I help you?

25:50.883 --> 25:53.593
That better not be a late-model
Lincoln Town Car you're crushing.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.261
- It's not.
- It's not?

25:55.346 --> 25:57.388
That's mine right there.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.560
Can I help you?

26:03.229 --> 26:05.563
- Oh. Where are they?
- Who?

26:05.648 --> 26:06.898
The punks who brought this in.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.152
I was running the crusher.
I didn't see anyone.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.238
The car belong to you, you can take it.

26:13.322 --> 26:14.447
I don't mind.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.617
It's not the car so much as what was inside
the trunk I'm concerned about.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.327
I don't know anything about that.

26:19.536 --> 26:20.995
Are you really gonna play it that way?

26:21.163 --> 26:23.498
We all know you scrap stolen cars.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.792
- What?
- Don't stonewall me, asshole.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.252
Everyone in the county knows.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.212
- I know you?
- No.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.673
And it's not me
you got to worry about, you sorry sack.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.508
That right over there
is a genuine US Marshal.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.676
Bob.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.927
You're a Marshal?

26:36.679 --> 26:39.472
Look, I ain't here on Marshals' business.

26:39.556 --> 26:42.016
I just want to know
about the man in the trunk.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.518
Or he can make it federal if you want to.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.813
Hell, he'll have a helicopter come down
here and hover for an hour,

26:46.897 --> 26:48.773
freak your shit out, son.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.942
There ain't nothing federal
about scrapping cars.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.236
If you are crushing stolen cars,

26:53.362 --> 26:56.364
you are destroying VIN numbers,
and that makes it federal.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.991
You had a guy in your trunk?

26:58.075 --> 27:00.034
I'm not required to...

27:01.412 --> 27:02.495
That looks federal.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.621
Where are they?

27:08.919 --> 27:12.130
You think you're up to killing him
if it comes to it?

27:13.048 --> 27:14.590
- You are?
- Yeah.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.552
You killed a man before?

27:17.761 --> 27:19.304
I killed two men. How's that?

27:19.722 --> 27:23.057
Oh, yeah? We killed 12 men just yesterday.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.478
Week before last I killed two heroin
dealers in Knoxville, Tennessee.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.147
Now, you get that angle grinder over there,

27:29.231 --> 27:31.232
cut my chain, I'll handle this.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.817
Why'd you kill them?

27:32.901 --> 27:35.278
Because I had to.
We are running out of time here, children.

27:35.612 --> 27:37.030
What, are you a junkie?

27:37.114 --> 27:38.990
No. I spot junkies,
follow them to their dealers,

27:39.074 --> 27:40.366
and rob them.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.410
Now, either aim that peashooter at that door

27:42.494 --> 27:45.663
and pull the trigger
on whoever comes through, or cut my chain.

27:46.415 --> 27:47.915
What'll it be?

27:53.464 --> 27:54.839
How you spot junkies?

27:54.923 --> 27:58.718
I spot bicycle thieves,
most bicycle thieves being heroin addicts.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.471
It's a fact. Try to avoid flesh.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.931
How you spot bicycle thieves?

28:04.767 --> 28:06.351
One day, me and my friend Kenneth,

28:06.435 --> 28:09.479
we saw a skinny guy go
up to an expensive bike.

28:09.605 --> 28:13.524
Specialised Giant. Got a bag across
his chest like he's a messenger,

28:13.609 --> 28:15.610
no one giving him a second look.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.279
He pulls out a Makita angle grinder,

28:18.364 --> 28:20.114
just like the one
in your boyfriend's hands there.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.534
Twenty seconds later,
he's through that lock and on his way.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.411
Now we just watch the good bikes.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.413
Wherever there are rich kids,
there are good bikes,

28:27.498 --> 28:30.124
junkies looking to grab them,
and we follow them.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.501
Shit!

28:32.294 --> 28:33.628
That really heats up the steel.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.631
Now give me that gun.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.842
Am I interrupting something?

28:39.968 --> 28:41.260
I was wondering when you'd walk in.

28:41.345 --> 28:42.929
Well, you can stop wondering. I'm here now.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.097
Shoot him.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.142
Jesus, girl, you just
showed me your tits 45 minutes ago.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.979
He thinks he's funny.
Don't listen to him. Shoot him.

28:52.106 --> 28:56.275
Miss, I am a Deputy US Marshal
with a one-time offer...

28:56.485 --> 28:59.821
Do as I say, you and your friend
get a free pass for stealing my car.

28:59.988 --> 29:00.988
He's lying.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.824
He's just saying that
'cause he's the one I'm after.

29:03.826 --> 29:07.495
I want you, son,
up here, on your belly, hands in front.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.168
Miss, you're gonna
hand me that gun, pistol grip first,

29:14.253 --> 29:15.670
right now.

29:18.382 --> 29:19.674
Let's go.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.551
I'm sorry, Raylan.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.678
You should see the shit in this bag.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.222
God damn it, Bob.
I asked you to do one thing, watch him.

29:26.348 --> 29:27.348
What the hell happened?

29:27.433 --> 29:28.850
He asked me to pull on him.

29:28.934 --> 29:29.976
I punched him in the nose.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.727
He did it wrong!

29:34.690 --> 29:38.443
Okay. I'm gonna
make you a similar offer I made these two...

29:38.944 --> 29:42.697
Do as I say,
and I'll let you skate on the VIN numbers.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.906
Ain't as good as his offer.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.075
- What'd he offer?
- $10,000.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.913
Jody, you got $10,000 stuck up your ass?

29:51.123 --> 29:53.541
Hey, we ain't stupid.
It's hidden up in Lexington.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.127
He's just... You know... All right.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.795
Doesn't matter. I'm gonna sweeten the deal.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.132
The three of you go free,
plus I'll give you whatever I got in my wallet.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.884
There's got to be at least $500 in there.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.139
Henry, check his wallet.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.057
He could be lying about that $500.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.893
Give me your wallet.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.650
Twelve bucks, Piggly Wiggly card.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.277
Give me that gun, girl!

30:27.409 --> 30:29.452
Careful, careful. You might hit her.

30:29.578 --> 30:33.789
I suppose I should care,
her age and all, but she did steal my car.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.082
Go ahead and shoot, then.

30:36.418 --> 30:39.086
Now, thank you for the ride.
I appreciate your company.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.755
But I think I need some alone time.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.010
Goodbye, Marshal.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.808
Watch out. Move away from that gun.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.687
Get up.
Put your hands on the table, nice and slow...

30:56.772 --> 30:58.231
Slow. You okay, Bob?

30:58.315 --> 31:00.066
All right, God damn it.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.859
Any chance we can take you up on that offer?

31:01.944 --> 31:03.152
Yeah, that's funny.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.654
Yeah, tell me the truth.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.615
You weren't at Arlo's for the copper wire
and you didn't want my car.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.783
It was just that bag.

31:10.619 --> 31:11.661
How come?

31:21.213 --> 31:23.256
You sure you don't
mind holding on to this stuff for me

31:23.340 --> 31:24.966
till we can really fix that door?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.801
It's just a bunch of photographs.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.511
I don't know why
anyone would want to steal it,

31:28.595 --> 31:30.346
but you never know.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.890
Yeah, sure thing, Mr Givens.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.477
What are you, his personal assistant?

31:36.895 --> 31:40.439
I'm not the one handcuffed
in the back of a car, asshole.

31:43.110 --> 31:47.989
So, listen, Bob. If it's cool with you, I'd just...

31:48.740 --> 31:50.783
Let's just keep this between us?

31:50.867 --> 31:52.285
Yeah, you think?

31:52.369 --> 31:54.579
Look, Raylan, I know why you called me.

31:54.663 --> 31:57.415
You couldn't call the cops,
'cause if they found the stolen car

31:57.499 --> 32:00.459
with a Tennessee bail jumper in the
back, what are you gonna say?

32:00.544 --> 32:02.086
You're out of the Marshals Service, right?

32:02.170 --> 32:03.671
So you called up Constable Bob.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.090
Listen, Bob, I'm sorry. I just...

32:08.760 --> 32:09.844
I got a kid on the way.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.514
I was trying to make
a little extra bank on the side, all right?

32:13.599 --> 32:14.807
You got a kid on the way?

32:14.891 --> 32:15.975
Yeah.

32:17.728 --> 32:20.271
But, hey, you stepped up.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.441
I stepped up. Stepped up.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.443
I stabbed a teenage girl in the foot.

32:25.902 --> 32:30.072
And because of that,
I'm alive, and you're alive,

32:30.157 --> 32:32.450
and we live to see another day.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.253
- Not a word.
- Not a problem.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.131
Raylan.

32:59.102 --> 33:02.021
So, how did you lose your rank?

33:02.147 --> 33:04.231
That was at Bagram, about six months ago.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.733
I got into a thing with an XO

33:05.817 --> 33:07.693
from another company at a baseball game.

33:08.362 --> 33:11.155
He slides in high
into second base during a charity game.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.992
Showing restraint, I kneed him in the nuts.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.703
I didn't think twice about it.
It's a game. Things happen.

33:18.205 --> 33:20.414
And then I heard the asshole reported it.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.085
That cost me the rank.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.586
But what got me my discharge

33:25.671 --> 33:29.340
was me walking into his billet
and shooting him in the bicep.

33:32.094 --> 33:33.594
I could have got Leavenworth.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.429
But everyone knew what a prick he was,

33:35.514 --> 33:39.600
so they suggested my service was complete.

33:41.770 --> 33:42.937
The guy used to curl 80 pounds.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.106
Now I heard he can hardly lift a phone, so...

33:51.697 --> 33:53.864
What can I do for you, Boyd?

33:56.618 --> 33:58.035
I'm a criminal.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.829
I know that.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.622
I got a problem.

34:02.416 --> 34:06.043
I need a little outside help,
someone I can trust.

34:07.212 --> 34:10.422
I wanted to see
how you might feel about crossing the line.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.675
That depends where the line is.

34:12.759 --> 34:13.884
Do you kill people?

34:14.678 --> 34:16.219
People have been killed.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.098
I don't have a pen or a piece of paper,

34:19.181 --> 34:20.808
but what would you say
are your greatest strengths

34:20.891 --> 34:23.101
and weaknesses, Colton Rhodes?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.896
This is a job interview now?

34:25.981 --> 34:27.273
It's a job.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.112
Tell you what, I got to go see a fella...
Owes me some money.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.364
Why don't you come along? Dry run.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.659
Let's just see how it goes.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.682
- You sell my home?
- Not yet.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.684
You set the asking price too high.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.352
I lowered it to $170,000.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.188
It hasn't sold. It's too high.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.355
You want me to just give it away?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.857
You want to get half of nothing?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.442
Maybe I'm listing it wrong.

35:11.777 --> 35:15.780
"Two-story, three-bedroom
country fixer-upper. Holes in the wall.

35:15.864 --> 35:16.947
"Missing a door."

35:18.617 --> 35:19.867
You're funny.

35:20.327 --> 35:21.869
Don't give me any shit, Arlo.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.329
I brought you what you wanted.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.958
- What's that?
- You don't know?

35:28.376 --> 35:31.212
Seems to me like you went to a lot of trouble
to get it out of your house.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.381
Hiring two wire-stripping teenagers
to get it for you.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.966
I did what now?

35:37.469 --> 35:39.303
You honestly don't know what this is?

35:39.596 --> 35:41.472
On your mother's grave.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.810
It had something in the bag.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.568
Can't read without my glasses.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.111
Kentucky driver's license.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.031
Issued September 7, 1979.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.117
First name, Waldo. Last name, Truth.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.205
That's a strange last name.

36:06.748 --> 36:07.873
Doesn't ring a bell?

36:08.333 --> 36:09.375
No.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.420
I'd think, a boy on the way,
you'd have more pressing concerns.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.839
Don't know if it's a boy.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.048
Kind of hoping it was a girl,

36:16.132 --> 36:17.716
end the family line right here.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.134
You think that'll do it?

36:19.219 --> 36:21.720
You think you get all your turmoil from me?

36:21.805 --> 36:24.557
Your mother was Frances, not Saint Frances.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.268
My advice? Just put that bag back in the wall

36:27.352 --> 36:28.602
and forget about it.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.521
I didn't say it was in the wall.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.775
Guard!

36:58.800 --> 37:00.718
Where's my money, Hiram?

37:00.802 --> 37:02.303
There's your money right there.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.974
That's very funny.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.476
You wouldn't think a man
with a stick of dynamite in his lap

37:09.561 --> 37:10.811
would go for funny.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.734
"Last Chance Holiness Church."
That's the place, huh?

37:16.902 --> 37:18.569
The place of my salvation.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.070
Well, you tell me where my money is, Hiram,

37:20.155 --> 37:21.739
and you can go on repenting all you want.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.908
I don't have it! I told you!

37:23.992 --> 37:25.743
I don't believe you.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.995
Truth always sounds like lies to a sinner.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.332
Let's go, Colt.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.000
- Where are you going?
- Outside.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.251
I don't want to die.

37:34.336 --> 37:36.337
And I'd say you got about eight seconds left,

37:36.421 --> 37:38.964
so I'd make sure
your conversion was in earnest.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.092
It's under the lawnmower!

37:42.177 --> 37:44.511
Oh, I'm ready, God! I'm ready!

37:49.309 --> 37:52.645
Open your eyes, Hiram,
for you have been saved twice.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.607
"I expect death to be nothingness."

37:59.152 --> 38:00.194
That ain't in the Bible.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.612
No, it is not.

38:02.489 --> 38:07.701
It's a science-fiction writer,
Isaac Asimov, God rest his soul,

38:08.328 --> 38:10.663
except he did not believe in God.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.624
Why'd you hold out so long?

38:14.960 --> 38:17.211
I wanted to give it to the church,

38:17.337 --> 38:19.004
make up for all the evil I'd done.

38:19.172 --> 38:22.466
You really think this church
is behind my falloff in oxy?

38:22.550 --> 38:24.176
Oh, I know it is.

38:24.386 --> 38:26.303
Preacher Billy's saving 'em
one sinner at a time.

38:26.388 --> 38:27.471
You should try it, Boyd.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.473
I've already tried it.

38:29.557 --> 38:33.477
Well, then, long run, you'll be finished.

38:34.396 --> 38:36.647
"Well, in the long run, we'll all be dead."

38:36.773 --> 38:39.692
You know who said that?
John Maynard Keynes.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.073
Now, for the record,
this money doesn't exist.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.950
Ava asks, anyone does, it wasn't here.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.868
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.495
Take care of him.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.129
What in the hell did you do that for?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.840
You said to take care of him.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.217
I meant cut him loose!

39:05.677 --> 39:07.511
Oh. Shit.

39:09.889 --> 39:13.183
Well, I guess I'll have
to be more careful with my words.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.107
Lindsey?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.363
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.

39:29.159 --> 39:31.994
Sorry, I had barbecue for dinner,

39:32.078 --> 39:35.122
and I did not want to use
that downstairs bathroom to floss.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.999
- It's okay.
- How'd it go?

39:37.876 --> 39:41.795
Wasn't without its difficulty,
but I got him there.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.631
To this super-hot bail bondswoman
you were talking about?

39:44.716 --> 39:46.467
I don't recall saying "super."

39:46.843 --> 39:48.469
I was just trying to be accurate.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.887
How much you get?

39:49.971 --> 39:51.430
10.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.557
Good for you.

39:56.561 --> 39:57.978
I better get back downstairs.

39:58.438 --> 39:59.480
Why?

39:59.564 --> 40:02.274
If I don't get down there soon,
Kent will get pissy.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.234
- You saw how busy it is.
- I did.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.237
It's "come get f'ed up" Friday.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.864
How do you define "soon"?

40:11.493 --> 40:13.368
Loosely.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.369
Praise the Lord! Yeah!

40:55.453 --> 40:57.454
Glory to God!

40:57.664 --> 40:58.956
Praise Jesus!

40:59.040 --> 41:00.457
Praise be the Lord!

41:00.542 --> 41:02.126
Oh, God almighty!

41:04.838 --> 41:08.966
Save me, Lord! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

41:09.425 --> 41:10.968
Hallelujah!

41:19.060 --> 41:20.811
You will be saved by our Lord!

41:21.146 --> 41:22.479
- Thank you, Jesus!
- Hallelujah!

41:22.981 --> 41:25.440
We will all be saved by our Lord!

41:25.525 --> 41:27.359
- Praise the Lord!
- Amen!

41:27.443 --> 41:28.735
Praise the Lord!

41:28.820 --> 41:31.155
Now, I see a lot of new faces here today.

41:32.365 --> 41:36.577
To you newcomers,
we here are signs followers.

41:38.454 --> 41:41.415
- Now, that comes from the Gospel of Mark.
- Hallelujah!

41:41.499 --> 41:45.711
"And these signs
shall follow them that believe."

41:45.962 --> 41:47.212
Hallelujah!

41:47.297 --> 41:49.715
But what you want to know...

41:51.676 --> 41:53.343
Is do I get bit?

41:54.429 --> 41:55.762
Well, am I right?

41:55.847 --> 41:57.347
Right.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.766
Yes, I do.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.270
Now, only twice so far...

42:04.689 --> 42:08.859
...by this one right here I call Mabel.

42:11.487 --> 42:14.740
Now, once,
I took her out of her crate too rough...

42:14.824 --> 42:16.325
I deserved it.

42:17.327 --> 42:20.037
The other time, well, the Lord only knows.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.290
Both times I survived the venom.

42:23.666 --> 42:29.504
It was the Lord
who saw fit to have me continue my ministry.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.219
Now, of course, not all survive.

42:36.721 --> 42:40.432
Our daddy and his before

42:41.559 --> 42:44.937
died from the serpent's bite,
their place in heaven guaranteed,

42:45.021 --> 42:47.648
there being no greater
sign of obedience to the Lord

42:47.732 --> 42:49.358
than to be taken home in such a manner.

42:49.442 --> 42:50.525
Hallelujah!

42:50.610 --> 42:52.110
So, that's why we're here.

42:52.946 --> 42:55.405
Why are you here, newcomers?

42:56.950 --> 43:01.286
You all come
to watch the hillbilly with the snakes?

43:02.455 --> 43:06.500
Or did you come to be saved?

43:07.126 --> 43:08.335
To be saved!

43:10.421 --> 43:12.172
Now, what about it?

43:15.927 --> 43:17.469
How about you?

43:18.221 --> 43:19.346
Yes, you.

43:48.793 --> 43:50.752
I didn't ask for a book.

43:51.504 --> 43:53.547
That your son, the Marshal, came to see you?

43:56.801 --> 43:58.176
Why?

43:58.261 --> 44:00.262
Saw him bring in some bag.

44:01.431 --> 44:05.100
You got your nose in everyone's business,
don't you, Trustee?

44:06.394 --> 44:07.769
Where'd he find that bag?

44:07.854 --> 44:10.731
I don't know and I didn't ask.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.233
And why do you want to know?

44:14.652 --> 44:17.487
Because I heard about a bag
like that once before.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.656
It could be worth some money,
old man, we play our cards right.

44:19.741 --> 44:22.075
These are our cards now?

44:22.160 --> 44:24.244
He showed you something else,
looked like an identification.

44:24.329 --> 44:26.455
You got an eagle eye.

44:26.539 --> 44:29.374
- What was it?
- Somebody's driver's license.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.418
- Name?
- Marlon Brando.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.337
I don't know.

44:33.463 --> 44:34.713
You tell anybody about this?

44:34.797 --> 44:36.131
Why would I tell anyone?

44:36.215 --> 44:37.299
Well, don't.

44:37.383 --> 44:38.550
Like I said, it's worth some money.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.218
I'll make a call and find out how much.

44:40.345 --> 44:41.595
Hold on.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.348
Give me a book while you're here.

44:44.932 --> 44:46.475
- You don't read.
- I can.

44:46.559 --> 44:48.894
Just don't choose to usually.

44:50.104 --> 44:52.064
- What do you want?
- Anything. I don't care.

44:52.190 --> 44:55.317
I forgot how slow the clock moves inside.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.196
You like spy stories?
I been hearing a lot of good things

44:59.280 --> 45:01.198
about this Alan Furst fellow.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.449
Fine.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.703
Why? Why?

45:10.625 --> 45:14.252
Got a Trustee down. Got a Trustee down.
Open that up.

45:23.012 --> 45:24.304
- Get some backup.
- Is he all right?
