00:10.641 --> 00:12.476
<i>You're thinking,
"It's almost Christmas.</i>

00:12.643 --> 00:15.103
<i>Even Spidey must have a tree to trim,
gifts to wrap."</i>

00:16.688 --> 00:18.190
- Go, go.
- I'm out of here.

00:18.357 --> 00:21.527
<i>But first,
I gotta wrap up a little investigation.</i>

00:22.611 --> 00:26.406
<i>See, even though I busted Mysterio,
all that tech he stole is still missing.</i>

00:26.573 --> 00:31.328
<i>And every lowlife I meet says
Blackie Gaxton's the man to talk to.</i>

00:31.495 --> 00:33.247
So talk, Blackie.

00:33.413 --> 00:35.165
Who are you kidding?

00:35.332 --> 00:38.752
What's the big hero gonna do
if I clam up?

00:38.919 --> 00:42.714
Blackie, give me 2-to-1 on--
Spider-Man.

00:44.216 --> 00:45.425
Bye.

00:47.135 --> 00:49.680
I don't know.
Maybe just hang out a while.

00:49.846 --> 00:51.265
Okay, okay.

00:51.431 --> 00:55.018
Rumour is, Mysterio was fronting
for some big boss.

00:55.185 --> 00:59.398
The guy's hiring cons, crooks,
even construction workers.

00:59.565 --> 01:03.318
But everyone's sworn to secrecy
on pain of you-know-what.

01:03.485 --> 01:06.321
That's the sum total
of my knowledge.

01:06.488 --> 01:08.156
Thanks, Blackie.
I owe you an eggnog.

01:11.660 --> 01:12.828
I'm Spidey-Claus.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.330
And what would your name be,
young man?

01:15.497 --> 01:17.374
It's Patch. Patch.

01:17.541 --> 01:19.626
Wow, did your parents have foresight
or what?

01:19.793 --> 01:22.921
Yeah, anyway, Patch,
you know what I want for Christmas?

01:23.088 --> 01:25.924
- Name of Mysterio's boss?
- That's a start.

01:26.383 --> 01:28.760
They call him the Master Planner.

01:28.927 --> 01:30.387
<i>But that's all I know.</i>

01:30.554 --> 01:32.389
<i>Look, believe me.</i>

01:34.182 --> 01:35.559
<i>Yes, Tinkerer?</i>

01:35.726 --> 01:38.061
Spider-Man's closing in.

01:38.228 --> 01:41.273
<i>Round up the usual suspects...</i>

01:41.857 --> 01:45.068
<i>...and destroy him.</i>

02:59.601 --> 03:01.770
Toomes, Beck. Breakfast.

03:01.937 --> 03:03.814
Move it or--

03:04.022 --> 03:06.441
A hologram. Oh, man, not again.

03:06.608 --> 03:08.276
The warden's gonna freak.

03:08.443 --> 03:10.654
At least you're real.

03:13.573 --> 03:14.616
Lockdown.

03:14.783 --> 03:17.077
Sandman and Rhino escaped.

03:20.163 --> 03:22.165
That's encouraging news, Cletus.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.334
But it was Max's turn to speak.

03:24.501 --> 03:26.670
Electro, doc. Electro.

03:26.837 --> 03:28.922
I don't need a regular name
no more.

03:29.089 --> 03:30.465
Right, Dr. Octopus?

03:30.924 --> 03:33.051
I beg you not to call me that.

03:33.218 --> 03:35.387
I despise everything
associated with that name.

03:35.554 --> 03:37.639
The criminal activities,
the wanton violence.

03:37.806 --> 03:42.310
Otto, your progress
is nothing short of amazing.

03:50.610 --> 03:52.571
Dr. Octopus, I presume.

03:52.738 --> 03:54.990
No, no, no. Leave me alone.

03:55.157 --> 03:56.658
Keep your paws off him.

03:56.825 --> 03:58.285
You misunderstand, doctor.

03:58.452 --> 04:00.954
Kraven is sent
to liberate you and Electro.

04:01.121 --> 04:02.164
Forget him.

04:02.330 --> 04:03.999
I used to worship the doc.

04:04.166 --> 04:06.334
But what's left of him
isn't worth the trouble.

04:10.839 --> 04:12.174
That's better.

04:12.340 --> 04:14.760
Let's blow this stand.

04:14.926 --> 04:17.095
Please, Max, you don't have to--

04:19.014 --> 04:23.393
I told you, it's Electro.

04:38.074 --> 04:39.785
Gotcha.

04:40.202 --> 04:42.704
Oh, so close.

04:44.706 --> 04:48.126
Peter, that was amazing.

04:48.293 --> 04:50.378
<i>Better not look too good.</i>

04:53.632 --> 04:55.842
Yeah, great triple klutz.

04:59.888 --> 05:02.891
Looks like my favourite tutor
needs a little lesson.

05:03.058 --> 05:04.226
Only if you're offering.

05:04.392 --> 05:06.394
I think I am.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.235
Flash, are you okay?

05:13.401 --> 05:14.653
Do I look okay?

05:14.820 --> 05:16.905
Sorry. I didn't mean--

05:17.072 --> 05:18.782
No. Forget it.

05:18.949 --> 05:22.160
So you started physical therapy?

05:22.702 --> 05:23.745
Yeah.

05:23.912 --> 05:27.165
Well, great.
Soon you'll be good as new.

05:27.332 --> 05:29.960
And those college scouts
will be busting down your door.

05:30.126 --> 05:31.920
- That's not exactly what he--
- Liz?

05:32.087 --> 05:33.213
I'm ready for my lesson.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.924
Petey, can't you see
I'm in the middle of something?

05:36.091 --> 05:37.801
Take yourself for a spin.

05:40.095 --> 05:41.555
Most of you have met.

05:41.721 --> 05:42.931
But Kraven and Electro...

05:43.098 --> 05:47.060
...this is Rhino, Vulture,
Sandman and Mysterio.

05:50.146 --> 05:51.898
Is there a problem?

05:52.065 --> 05:54.568
I've had bad experiences with cats.

05:55.110 --> 05:59.322
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
our host and benefactor:

05:59.489 --> 06:01.408
The Master Planner.

06:01.575 --> 06:06.496
<i>Tinkerer informs me
Dr. Octopus declined my invitation.</i>

06:06.663 --> 06:08.832
<i>This is disappointing.</i>

06:08.999 --> 06:12.460
<i>I had so hoped to inaugurate
the Sinister Seven.</i>

06:12.627 --> 06:14.504
Four, five.

06:14.671 --> 06:17.090
Don't we got seven?
What about this guy?

06:17.257 --> 06:18.925
Strictly technical support.

06:19.092 --> 06:21.303
Trust me, he is useless in a fight.

06:21.469 --> 06:22.762
<i>No matter.</i>

06:22.929 --> 06:25.640
<i>A new Sinister Six will suffice.</i>

06:25.807 --> 06:28.310
Suffice for what, exactly?

06:28.476 --> 06:32.105
<i>To help me inaugurate
the age of the super-criminal.</i>

06:32.272 --> 06:35.066
<i>This is your time,
my colourful friends.</i>

06:35.233 --> 06:38.820
<i>Once you dispose
of a certain red-and-blue-clad pest.</i>

06:38.987 --> 06:40.322
Excuse me?

06:40.488 --> 06:44.284
How exactly is a new Six supposed
to fare any better than the old one?

06:44.451 --> 06:48.663
<i>Unsurprisingly, I have a plan.</i>

06:56.338 --> 06:57.380
Yeah.

07:05.096 --> 07:08.433
Hey, QB. Want a slushy?

07:13.021 --> 07:15.440
Oh, yeah. Delicious.

07:17.025 --> 07:18.693
You are so going down.

07:18.860 --> 07:20.820
- In your dreams.
- Get him, Flash.

07:24.157 --> 07:27.160
Hey, Gwen. Stand a little company?

07:29.037 --> 07:31.873
Whoa, look.
What did I do to deserve--?

07:32.040 --> 07:34.542
You've barely said two words
to me since--

07:34.709 --> 07:36.169
Since the you-know-what.

07:36.336 --> 07:39.464
So I get it, okay?
I'm not your first choice.

07:39.631 --> 07:42.425
But I won't be
your second choice either.

07:45.053 --> 07:47.389
Skating on thin ice again, eh?

07:47.555 --> 07:50.266
M.J. You saw that, huh?

07:50.433 --> 07:53.895
Saw it, heard it.
It's so painful, I almost felt it.

07:54.062 --> 07:56.898
Look, tiger,
you're one of my favourite guys.

07:57.065 --> 08:00.610
<i>Would you look at her?
She's gorg--</i>

08:00.777 --> 08:02.946
But you distract too easy.

08:03.113 --> 08:05.031
Gwen's got a totally legit gripe.

08:05.198 --> 08:06.449
Decide what you want, Pete.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.868
Then focus on getting it done.

08:09.035 --> 08:13.915
Don't suppose you'd help a poor
distractible boy sort through all this?

08:14.666 --> 08:16.876
I sort better with cocoa.

08:17.043 --> 08:19.546
Sorting cocoa coming right up.

08:26.845 --> 08:29.180
He's not here.

08:29.347 --> 08:31.433
<i>He's here. I smell him.</i>

08:31.599 --> 08:33.393
<i>Team one, deploy.</i>

08:33.559 --> 08:36.020
<i>That will lure the do-gooder
into the open.</i>

08:36.187 --> 08:37.731
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>

08:40.607 --> 08:42.027
Hot.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.699
Spider-Man.

08:47.866 --> 08:51.161
Come out to play.

08:53.455 --> 08:57.042
And that's probably
the least painful part of my night.

09:00.003 --> 09:02.630
Show yourself, you wall-crawling--

09:02.797 --> 09:05.759
Now, now, watch the mouth.
There are children present.

09:05.925 --> 09:07.427
What?

09:10.472 --> 09:13.349
I burned my tongue, okay?

09:22.776 --> 09:25.570
Beaky? ls there a revolving door
at that prison?

09:25.737 --> 09:26.988
What?

09:27.155 --> 09:30.200
<i>I need to stop with the banter
till the tongue's had time to heal.</i>

09:30.366 --> 09:32.869
<i>Vulture and Electro
are a pretty unlikely team of two.</i>

09:33.036 --> 09:35.538
<i>Gotta figure
on the entire Simpleton Six.</i>

09:36.831 --> 09:38.249
Hey, Vultch, you notice?

09:38.416 --> 09:41.127
Big hero
doesn't seem too focused on us.

09:41.294 --> 09:43.213
Why, you're right.

09:43.379 --> 09:46.800
It's almost as if he expects
more company.

10:01.689 --> 10:03.274
<i>Gotta get these goons off the ice.</i>

10:03.441 --> 10:04.526
Come on, guys.

10:04.692 --> 10:06.027
Let's play Follow the Leader.

10:06.194 --> 10:08.363
Let's not.

10:12.784 --> 10:14.619
<i>Okay, can't lure him away.</i>

10:14.786 --> 10:15.829
<i>Gotta take him out</i>

10:15.995 --> 10:18.998
<i>- So focus and make your play.
- No.</i>

10:19.165 --> 10:21.960
<i>Beaky's awfully protective
of that glorified tiara.</i>

10:22.127 --> 10:26.381
<i>Which means I can use his paranoia
to pin his wings.</i>

10:29.467 --> 10:31.553
I said, no.

10:37.809 --> 10:41.938
You know, for an evil old nob,
you make a lovely ornament.

10:42.105 --> 10:45.483
Don't worry, Vultch.
Electro's got your back.

10:45.650 --> 10:46.860
No, you fool.

10:47.026 --> 10:49.529
I'll be free in a moment.

10:52.532 --> 10:54.117
You blew up a Christmas tree?

10:54.284 --> 10:56.911
The Christmas tree? Harsh.

11:02.458 --> 11:04.252
- Liz, move.
- Flash.

11:08.548 --> 11:10.091
Whoa, Spidey, thanks.

11:10.258 --> 11:12.051
Hey, sign my cast.

11:12.218 --> 11:13.469
Maybe later.

11:15.305 --> 11:16.890
Mary Jane, where's Peter?

11:24.147 --> 11:25.648
<i>At least I got him off the ice.</i>

11:28.902 --> 11:30.945
<i>Now if I could just get him
off the planet.</i>

11:31.112 --> 11:32.906
<i>Hello.</i>

11:36.451 --> 11:38.995
You won't escape me that easy.

11:47.879 --> 11:50.173
That your best shot? Feeble.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.091
If at first, yadda-yadda-yadda.

12:01.351 --> 12:03.186
Eventually, you'll run out of tyres.

12:03.353 --> 12:05.480
And then I'll--

12:07.357 --> 12:10.360
Then you'll what?
Take me out for a spin?

12:17.992 --> 12:19.869
That coat--
Or should I say coating.

12:20.036 --> 12:21.621
--Looks amazing on you.

12:21.788 --> 12:24.207
Non-conductive, you say?
Gorgeous.

12:33.549 --> 12:36.636
Hey, Spidey, don't fade on us now.

12:36.803 --> 12:39.806
Sparks and Flaps
were just the appetiser.

12:40.265 --> 12:42.725
Time for the main course.

12:53.528 --> 12:55.238
Anyone get the number
of that sleigh?

12:58.866 --> 13:00.702
Ain't he a clever boy?

13:00.868 --> 13:03.746
See it's Christmas Eve,
and he said, "sleigh."

13:03.913 --> 13:05.206
You know, instead of truck.

13:05.373 --> 13:07.875
Too bad I'm more like a tank.

13:13.965 --> 13:16.092
- Hey.
- The thing about tanks?

13:16.259 --> 13:17.593
They don't corner well.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.721
Plus they're ugly.

13:19.887 --> 13:22.390
Hey, O'Hirn, this is kind of fun,
me and you, right?

13:23.182 --> 13:24.642
Just like old times.

13:24.809 --> 13:27.145
Only now, we're kicking his tail.

13:30.231 --> 13:31.899
Excuse me, pardon me.
Coming through.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.075
Arms, check. Legs, check.

13:41.242 --> 13:42.577
Head, check.

13:42.744 --> 13:45.538
And my burnt tongue's better too.
Christmas miracle.

13:48.082 --> 13:49.667
A bug for a bug.

13:49.834 --> 13:51.127
Yeah, I got that.

13:51.294 --> 13:54.422
- For you, that was clever.
- Thanks.

13:57.884 --> 14:01.554
Guys, <i>feliz</i> Navidad.
Happy Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, solstice.

14:02.263 --> 14:05.016
Can't we put our differences aside
for one night?

14:05.183 --> 14:06.309
- Nope.
- Nope.

14:07.852 --> 14:09.103
When we're done with you...

14:09.270 --> 14:11.731
...there won't be enough left
to stuff my stocking.

14:16.652 --> 14:18.196
Hey, Rhino, toss him over.

14:18.363 --> 14:21.449
I wanna pull off that mask
and see who he is before we end it.

14:22.533 --> 14:26.913
Sorry, I'm strictly a do-not-unwrap-
until-Christmas-morning superhero.

14:28.956 --> 14:32.126
<i>Okay, playing punching bag turns
out to be remarkably ineffective...</i>

14:32.293 --> 14:34.379
<i>...so focus on Plan B.</i>

14:44.764 --> 14:47.350
- That all you got?
- Oh, I got more.

14:47.517 --> 14:49.977
If you think you're beast enough
to come and get it.

14:50.144 --> 14:52.188
I'll show you who's beast enough.

14:54.107 --> 14:56.275
Here. You're gonna need this.

14:57.151 --> 14:59.153
I hate you so much.

15:11.374 --> 15:12.458
<i>He's slower.</i>

15:12.625 --> 15:15.962
<i>The night air's freezing that
hydrant water saturating his silicates.</i>

15:17.547 --> 15:19.340
<i>He's not the only one.</i>

15:19.507 --> 15:21.217
<i>Guess we'll do this the hard way.</i>

15:24.011 --> 15:26.055
Heads up, Frosty.

15:30.935 --> 15:32.812
Four down, two to go.

15:32.979 --> 15:36.441
All right.
Shocker, Octopus, show yourselves.

15:36.607 --> 15:38.776
Arachnid.

15:40.778 --> 15:42.738
<i>Oh, me and my big mouth.</i>

15:42.905 --> 15:46.534
<i>I've already been fried, slashed,
battered and frozen tonight.</i>

15:46.701 --> 15:49.954
<i>I'm a web-head
in desperate need of downtime.</i>

15:54.542 --> 15:56.502
So not what I meant.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.685
<i>I'm totally wiped, and let's face</i> it...

16:12.852 --> 16:15.646
<i>...I've never actually beaten
the Six myself.</i>

16:15.813 --> 16:17.648
<i>Oh, man, I hope it's only six.</i>

16:19.775 --> 16:21.527
<i>Think I lost them.</i>

16:22.904 --> 16:24.822
<i>Lock your chimneys, folks.</i>

16:25.907 --> 16:27.241
Fool.

16:27.408 --> 16:28.743
No prey escapes Kraven.

16:28.910 --> 16:31.412
I track smell of your fear
to ends of earth.

16:31.579 --> 16:34.415
Big talk for a substitute loser.

16:34.582 --> 16:37.585
Guess the great hunter was afraid
to take me on alone this time.

16:37.752 --> 16:39.378
Is way of jungle.

16:39.545 --> 16:44.091
The pack wears prey down
for alpha male to crush.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.864
It's called Poisson Gété. Nice, huh?

17:13.119 --> 17:14.497
Spider-Man.

17:20.962 --> 17:23.673
Wow, great perfume.
Can I try some?

17:29.971 --> 17:32.348
Can you smell me now?

17:33.307 --> 17:35.893
A bit too soon to gloat, Spider-Man.

17:36.060 --> 17:38.729
Well, you are the expert
on premature gloatilation.

17:38.896 --> 17:41.399
We shall see.

17:45.778 --> 17:47.947
Rematch. Rematch.

17:48.489 --> 17:49.782
That's it.

17:49.949 --> 17:51.409
- Harassment.
- Call my lawyer.

17:52.493 --> 17:54.328
No Christmas spirit.

18:02.128 --> 18:03.212
Second floor.

18:03.379 --> 18:07.008
Toys, housewares,
superhero defeats.

18:19.562 --> 18:20.730
Kraven, no.

18:21.689 --> 18:25.318
<i>If the real Mysterio's down there,
then this one's a bot.</i>

18:25.484 --> 18:26.611
<i>A bot about to--</i>

18:26.777 --> 18:28.112
Oh, fudge.

18:48.174 --> 18:51.302
Please tell me these guys
are going on the naughty list.

18:52.511 --> 18:53.554
Mysterio.

18:53.721 --> 18:56.641
I'm using that stupid fishbowl of yours
as a snow globe.

18:56.807 --> 18:58.559
Not if you can't find me.

19:12.031 --> 19:13.532
Whoa, easy there, hero.

19:14.784 --> 19:16.285
No need for vio--

19:16.452 --> 19:19.205
- Just making sure you're not a bot.
- I'm not, I'm not.

19:19.372 --> 19:21.540
I know the Master Planner
set this up.

19:21.707 --> 19:24.377
Who is he? And what's he doing
with that tech you stole?

19:24.543 --> 19:25.711
Gee, I don't know.

19:25.878 --> 19:30.299
Think maybe the Master Planner
has a master plan?

19:48.275 --> 19:51.654
Be ready.
The Vulture's still dangerous.

19:52.655 --> 19:54.281
I'm sure Pete's fine.

19:54.448 --> 19:56.367
Why wouldn't I be?

19:56.826 --> 19:57.952
Pete.

19:58.119 --> 20:00.538
- Hot.
- Sorry, sorry.

20:00.705 --> 20:03.457
Wait, no, I'm not sorry.
Where have you been?

20:03.624 --> 20:06.293
The snack bar ran out of cocoa,
so I went down the street.

20:06.460 --> 20:09.463
- Why?
- So you missed all the action?

20:09.880 --> 20:11.048
I thought--

20:11.215 --> 20:14.552
I thought you were buried
under that tree.

20:15.177 --> 20:17.722
<i>Parker, you are a grade-A idiot.</i>

20:18.681 --> 20:19.890
Gwen.

20:20.057 --> 20:23.269
I know that I've been
unfocused and--

20:23.436 --> 20:24.812
He's gone.

20:28.274 --> 20:30.776
<i>Extractions complete?</i>

20:34.196 --> 20:37.199
Extractions complete.

20:37.950 --> 20:39.535
<i>Or nearly.</i>

20:39.702 --> 20:43.748
<i>The rest of the Six are still at large
and considered extremely dangerous.</i>

20:44.498 --> 20:47.334
This is not right. Not right.

20:47.501 --> 20:51.297
Otto, nobody's going to hurt you.

20:58.596 --> 21:00.139
No. No.

21:03.851 --> 21:07.480
No, no, no!

21:13.068 --> 21:15.821
<i>Only Mysterio
was taken into custody.</i>

21:15.988 --> 21:17.782
Man, he better not be another robot.

21:17.948 --> 21:20.367
Peter, please. It's Christmas.

21:20.534 --> 21:22.870
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

21:23.662 --> 21:25.539
Here. Open yours.

21:28.042 --> 21:30.628
Oh, Peter, it's lovely.

21:30.795 --> 21:35.132
I figured it's our first Christmas
without him.

21:35.299 --> 21:37.176
I wanted to find a way to--

21:37.343 --> 21:38.552
He's here, Peter.

21:38.969 --> 21:41.222
He's always here.
