00:06.923 --> 00:10.551
I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?

00:11.970 --> 00:13.637
Yes.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.475
Um, you like Rachel?

00:20.270 --> 00:23.647
Yes. I like Rachel.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.363
Rachel?

00:32.866 --> 00:35.951
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...

00:36.161 --> 00:38.495
You know who else I like? You.

00:38.788 --> 00:42.499
And it doesn't get said enough.
I like you, Ross.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.212
- "Rachel" Rachel?
- It's not a big deal.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.883
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just...

00:52.177 --> 00:54.344
What about the stuff you said?

00:54.637 --> 00:59.266
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

00:59.434 --> 01:01.268
I'm an actor, you know?

01:01.519 --> 01:05.397
As a group, we tend to be
overdramatic.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.817
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

01:09.069 --> 01:12.446
I know it's bad.
And I know it's wrong, okay?

01:12.655 --> 01:15.783
It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.994
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.747
You know, I gotta go.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.290
Hey, Ross...

01:23.500 --> 01:27.461
You know, I just have one...
Rachel?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.675
Rachel?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.182
Rachel?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.892
Oh, oh! Okay, she's kicking.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.354
She's growing inside you.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.605
- Whoa!
- Oh.

02:28.815 --> 02:33.360
- That was a big one.
- That's the youngest girl to reject me.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.779
- You guys!
- Hey there.

02:36.072 --> 02:39.283
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

02:39.576 --> 02:40.784
Oh, yes, I do.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.787
There's one person out there
for everyone.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.999
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.252
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.296
He'll find me.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.630
Uh-huh. And you?

02:53.923 --> 02:59.094
No. I believe that, uh, certain people are
more suited for each other, but...

02:59.304 --> 03:01.930
- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
- Good.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.933
- Why?
- Well, last night, I met Monica's.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.023
- What?
- Yeah.

03:11.274 --> 03:15.152
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.

03:15.361 --> 03:20.532
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

03:23.661 --> 03:25.704
Well, what's he like?

03:26.122 --> 03:29.333
- He's tall. He has brown hair.
- Of course.

03:29.542 --> 03:34.004
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

03:34.672 --> 03:37.257
- He works with food.
- Oh, sure. Older?

03:37.467 --> 03:39.968
- Obviously. And he's British.
- I was just gonna ask!

03:40.178 --> 03:45.682
Yeah? And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.352
It's so sad they never met.

03:48.561 --> 03:53.148
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.151
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.321
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.491
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

04:02.700 --> 04:05.953
He may not be my soul mate,
but a girl's gotta eat.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.168
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.588
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.884
I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.221
It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.307
I know you're hurting...

04:27.558 --> 04:29.518
...but don't say that again.

04:31.187 --> 04:35.440
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.776
You don't need to worry.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.487
He'll never tell her how he feels.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.615
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

04:43.825 --> 04:47.828
Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.833
- He isn't thinking about going for her.
- He's not?

04:53.084 --> 04:56.753
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.924
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

05:01.926 --> 05:05.470
- Why?
- He wants to leave the country.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.935
He thinks you hate him.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.730
Hate him?

05:16.149 --> 05:18.859
No, I don't hate him.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.281
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

05:24.532 --> 05:28.618
I can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you...

05:28.828 --> 05:32.831
...but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.

05:33.082 --> 05:37.461
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.757
Okay, I'll talk to him.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.675
I'd do it soon.

05:43.926 --> 05:48.805
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

05:54.395 --> 05:57.147
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.609
- Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
- Hello.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.778
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.780
Soul mate.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.286
- What are you guys doing?
- We had lunch at Adriatica.

06:11.537 --> 06:16.166
- What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
- I know! Is this 1985?

06:16.376 --> 06:20.087
- That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
- Not really.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.965
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

06:25.885 --> 06:28.678
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.347
No?

06:31.808 --> 06:35.394
- What restaurants do you like?
- Octavio. 27-and-7.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.940
- There's this place, Alessandro's.
- Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

06:40.149 --> 06:42.984
You're kidding!
Your food is fantastic!

06:43.236 --> 06:47.322
I want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?

06:47.532 --> 06:50.826
If you're talking about me,
I'll go with you.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.205
What are you doing?

06:55.832 --> 06:59.209
I swear, I didn't know you guys
would be here.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.878
You don't believe in soul mates, so...

07:02.088 --> 07:06.049
I believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.

07:06.259 --> 07:11.471
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.015
- Phoebe? Good work.
- Yeah?

07:14.225 --> 07:16.893
He's great. I love him.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.524
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.369
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.374
I understand if you came by to hit me.
I deserve it.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.877
No, I don't want to hit you.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.588
What, then? Kick me?

07:44.922 --> 07:46.173
No.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.884
Bite me?

07:49.594 --> 07:52.137
I don't want to do anything to you.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.599
I just want to say I'm not
mad at you...

07:57.059 --> 08:00.395
...and that I certainly
do not hate you.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.191
I just came here to say that.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.735
Hey, wait, Ross?

08:08.029 --> 08:11.907
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.077
Yeah, sure.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.501
You got any beer?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.590
All I got is melon stuff
that Rachel left.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.425
Okay.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.186
You need to understand something.

08:45.107 --> 08:49.444
I am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?

08:49.695 --> 08:54.491
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.327
Thank you.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.293
Mm.

09:13.844 --> 09:18.181
Anyway, it'll just...

09:18.349 --> 09:21.768
It'll take me a while to get over her.

09:22.019 --> 09:26.147
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so...

09:26.399 --> 09:27.899
What?

09:30.486 --> 09:33.029
You're in love with her?

09:33.281 --> 09:37.993
- Yeah. I thought you knew that.
- Um, no.

09:39.829 --> 09:44.291
Look, if it helps, I don't want
to feel this way, honest.

09:44.500 --> 09:48.878
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?

09:49.130 --> 09:53.049
But it just keeps getting harder.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.720
I don't know what to do, you know?

09:58.222 --> 10:00.348
What do I do?

10:06.188 --> 10:12.360
- You need to tell her how you feel.
- That's the green stuff talking.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.866
I'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.

10:18.117 --> 10:22.037
If she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.415
But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be...

10:25.625 --> 10:28.960
If she is where you are...

10:31.464 --> 10:35.717
...then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.803
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.932
If she ends up with somebody else...

10:43.184 --> 10:47.062
...the truth is,
she couldn't find a better guy.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.606
Hey, thanks.

10:50.900 --> 10:56.196
- So when are you gonna talk to her?
- Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.784
I haven't thought about it.
What should I say?

11:00.993 --> 11:03.578
I'm understanding,
but let's not get carried away.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.998
Right, sorry. Sorry.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.376
What am I gonna say?

11:13.255 --> 11:15.757
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:30.064 --> 11:35.235
I'm phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the, um, cheese.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.362
Cheese, you say?

11:37.613 --> 11:40.949
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

11:41.534 --> 11:45.161
- Excuse me?
- Cheese. It's smelly.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.541
You must smell a lot of the time too.

11:50.793 --> 11:55.964
Uh, not really. But with cheese,
I think the smellier, the better.

11:56.173 --> 12:00.885
Me too! Chandler hates it.
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.180
And you're still married to him?

12:08.310 --> 12:14.065
I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.568
Not even bread. Just cheese.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.695
No, I want the bread.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.322
And pastries.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.658
And pâté.

12:24.034 --> 12:27.704
I'm really not high.
I just used to be fat.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.041
I have a villa in the Loire Valley
you can stay in.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.377
Is it made of cheese?

12:37.339 --> 12:40.925
No. A house made of cheese,
wouldn't that be great?

12:41.135 --> 12:44.012
- I'd move in tomorrow!
- Oh, come on!

12:45.723 --> 12:48.016
- Listen to this!
- I'm so sorry.

12:48.184 --> 12:52.520
- What do we do?
- They both want a house of cheese.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.107
I don't know how you fight that.

13:02.406 --> 13:06.868
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.454
Okay, stand up straight.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.582
Take a couple deep breaths.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.085
Look confident.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.925
Joey? What's up?

13:22.176 --> 13:26.554
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.847
What's up?

13:28.224 --> 13:31.226
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

13:31.435 --> 13:34.896
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

13:35.606 --> 13:38.733
I just came by to tell you that...

13:39.109 --> 13:42.987
...I want to have dinner with you.

13:43.197 --> 13:47.784
- Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.
- Okay.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.287
Okay. That's good.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.833
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.378
Don't you people ever knock?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.715
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.384
Sure. Set it up.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.846
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.349
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.600
Yeah. Fine.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.185
Not perfect.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.312
But good enough.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.398
Jeez, what's with you?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.651
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

14:23.112 --> 14:27.323
- What's going on?
- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.785
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

14:31.036 --> 14:36.291
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

14:36.542 --> 14:41.629
- You don't believe in soul mates?
- No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.050
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.552
- You don't?
- Nope.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.388
We weren't destined
to end up together.

14:50.639 --> 14:54.225
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.145
Some days we work really hard.

14:57.771 --> 15:01.983
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

15:02.192 --> 15:08.197
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.909
- I love you.
- I know.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.661
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

15:13.829 --> 15:18.291
I found this place that makes the greatest
mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.045
No? They taste so good.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.846
It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.933
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.230
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.

15:42.358 --> 15:46.736
Uh, look, the reason...

15:48.864 --> 15:50.823
Is it hot in here?

15:51.033 --> 15:54.285
No, not for me.
Why don't you take off your sweater?

15:55.204 --> 15:57.246
This is a nice place...

15:57.498 --> 16:02.293
...and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

16:02.503 --> 16:06.297
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

16:06.507 --> 16:07.757
Yeah, sure.

16:10.594 --> 16:14.263
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.058
Uh...

16:20.562 --> 16:22.397
How long have we known each other?

16:22.564 --> 16:25.233
Um, seven, eight...

16:25.484 --> 16:27.527
Eight years. Wow.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.821
- Uh-huh. A long time.
- Yeah.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.158
But over the past few weeks, I...

16:34.410 --> 16:38.913
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.873
Our specials tonight...

16:41.083 --> 16:43.751
- Could you give us a second?
- Sure.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.253
Second's up!

16:48.674 --> 16:52.093
Not that kind of table.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.931
So you were saying?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.018
I'm not sure.

17:00.269 --> 17:04.981
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.

17:05.273 --> 17:09.652
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half...

17:11.446 --> 17:13.406
...and now here we are.

17:13.781 --> 17:16.826
Yeah. Here we are.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.996
Uh...

17:26.502 --> 17:29.464
I think I'm falling in love with you.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.217
What?

17:35.345 --> 17:38.222
I'm falling in love with you.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.566
Who are you talking to?

17:50.152 --> 17:52.945
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.907
Funny. It's funny!

17:56.158 --> 17:58.242
I don't get it.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.582
Oh.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.170
Okay.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.509
Wow.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.055
Are you, um?

18:21.850 --> 18:24.227
How did, um?

18:25.354 --> 18:26.562
When?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.400
Does it really matter?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.905
Wow. Wow.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.366
It is hot in here.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.284
I know this is a lot.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.788
You don't have to say anything.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.251
You take as much time as you need.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.552
Okay, you gotta say something.

18:58.428 --> 19:03.015
Joey, I love you so much.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.309
- But...
- But.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.603
Joey?

19:07.896 --> 19:10.481
Right. Hey, that's, uh...

19:10.774 --> 19:13.025
That's okay. That's fine.

19:13.235 --> 19:18.156
It's, uh, pretty much
what I was expecting.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.118
It's no big deal, all right?

19:25.289 --> 19:29.083
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Please don't leave like this.

19:29.293 --> 19:33.045
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

19:33.922 --> 19:35.548
Don't start doing that.

19:35.799 --> 19:39.343
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me...

19:39.553 --> 19:41.554
Oh, there we go!

19:44.057 --> 19:47.143
- Can I?
- Sure.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.606
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...

19:51.815 --> 19:53.941
Hey, hey.

19:55.819 --> 19:59.488
You can't, okay? Ever.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.201
I'm so sorry.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.495
Please don't be sorry.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.956
Okay? Don't be sorry.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.176
You know, I was only kidding.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.763
Yeah, that was a real good one.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.317
- Is this your table?
- Yeah.

20:36.526 --> 20:39.028
- You'll be here all night.
- I know.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.864
I haven't even read the specials.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.824
What's the matter?

20:44.034 --> 20:48.829
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.168
I kind of hope it's the girl.

20:55.128 --> 20:58.256
The guy is really cute!
