02:01.538 --> 02:03.164
Where
are you going?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.499
Mogadishu.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.128
Why your visa is cancelled?

02:08.878 --> 02:10.255
My mother, she's sick.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.760
What's in your pocket?

02:19.514 --> 02:21.057
Show me what's in your pocket.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.719
I wonder what it smells like.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.928
Who cares? Hurry up.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.140
They must have put
it up yesterday.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.642
Just tick your
boxes and let's go!

03:08.313 --> 03:09.898
Bulb's out.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.608
What? Where?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.611
Top left.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.613
The day shift will fix it.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.990
I can't leave her
looking like that.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.957
-So, are you happy now?
-Yes

04:52.166 --> 04:54.210
Easy, dhakkan!

04:58.756 --> 05:00.133
I'm borrowing this.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.138
I bet it smells like jasmine.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.641
If you don't shut up, I'll give
you another smell to think
about.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.730
So, what are you doing today?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.567
I'm moving to a new house.

05:17.608 --> 05:18.860
You need help with your things?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.236
What things?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.375
How many times have I told you
about the rules of safety in
this company?

05:34.417 --> 05:36.169
Sir, please. It wasn't my fault.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.795
Whose fault was it then?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.214
-It was one of the other guys.
-This is what you always say.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.300
Sir, please - just
give me another chance.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.302
Three warnings in three months!

05:45.428 --> 05:47.388
Sorry, I cannot accept that.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.223
-Just give me another chance.
-Take your settlement.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.600
Sir, please.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.644
Hand in all your belongings.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.979
And get out.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.235
30 days.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.320
Huh? What?

06:02.528 --> 06:03.863
Terminated.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.907
Jobless.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.118
30 days to piss off
back to his own country.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.922
I'll just go sign off and
I'll see you at the truck.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.442
You don't look at your hands?

06:41.484 --> 06:43.194
What?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.779
When you type. You don't
look at your hands?

06:49.659 --> 06:50.785
What happened to Salim?

06:52.328 --> 06:54.122
Vacation?

06:55.665 --> 06:57.875
Permanent. Vacation.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.545
What about his billboards?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.298
Can you handle them?

07:04.340 --> 07:06.134
I love my job.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.927
Is that what I asked you?

07:18.604 --> 07:20.815
This is perfect.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.153
Stick with this for now.
I might add more later.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.614
I'd look like a million
dollars wearing this suit.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.838
Hello.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.245
Indian?

10:22.204 --> 10:23.706
I'm Caweys.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.983
Aaden?

13:07.745 --> 13:09.830
Jimmy isn't here.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.873
Who?

13:11.749 --> 13:13.626
-Jimmy.
-Who's that?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.252
The guy that isn't here.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.200
Hello.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.703
I'm looking
for Mr. Jimmish.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.625
I saw him come up.
Does he live here?

13:56.627 --> 13:58.546
Jimmish?

13:58.587 --> 14:00.422
That sounds like a sneeze.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.007
A sneeze?

14:03.425 --> 14:05.219
How appropriate.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.723
I'm afraid what Mr. Jimmish
has is quite contagious.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.901
My name's Darbaan. My number.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.738
Where are you from?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.242
Mogadishu.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.912
Bless you.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.795
Mmm.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.756
Don't touch my things.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.758
At the door. You're
a good talker, man.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.802
I like it.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.681
-What do you do?
-Advertising.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.516
Advertising?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.727
I'm in finance.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.438
So the guy, he's
your accountant?

14:57.479 --> 14:59.273
No, he's an investor. But the
market's down, you know?

15:00.482 --> 15:02.610
And you live in this palace?

15:02.651 --> 15:03.903
No, brother.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.280
I just come here to take a shit.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.289
The only way you'll get any of
that stuff is if you steal it.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.290
I'm not a thief.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.833
No.

15:17.875 --> 15:21.295
But you are a dreamer.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.131
All good thieves are dreamers.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.315
Saving up for my daughter's
dowry will be the death of me.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.859
Never have girls!

15:45.319 --> 15:47.696
-You married a girl right?
-Yeah, so?

15:49.448 --> 15:50.658
What did you get for your dowry?

15:51.825 --> 15:54.995
I got two buffaloes.
And a motorcycle.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.914
And I sold one buffalo
to come to Dubai.

15:59.708 --> 16:00.918
You still have
the other buffalo?

16:01.877 --> 16:04.046
Yes, I was just talking to her.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.014
Gandu, are you back
to your dreamland?

16:16.725 --> 16:18.143
One day I'm gonna
wear that watch.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.711
Sir...

16:43.752 --> 16:45.254
Hi Caweys.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.217
I want to work in sales.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.970
I can do it.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.222
I work hard. I'm dedicated.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.725
I love working here.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.894
I'm a people person.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.313
You know all my sales team
have Bachelor's degrees?

17:05.065 --> 17:06.984
Master's, even?

17:07.484 --> 17:08.902
And you haven't even
finished school.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.240
Nobody in this city will offer
you a better job if you haven't
finished school.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.244
So this is all I'm worth?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.930
Hey, Dreamer.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.266
My name is Caweys.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.945
Hey you - you going to your
perfume billboard tonight?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.158
-Mmhmm.
-I got something for you.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.203
Here.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.752
Hey don't open it
until you get there.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.925
Hey, are these yours?

18:13.425 --> 18:14.718
No.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.854
It's fine.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.857
It's fine.

19:15.237 --> 19:19.158
Listen, all this stuff?
They're just things.

19:20.951 --> 19:24.496
-Not for us to own.
-I don't want to own them.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.834
-I just want to know what it's
like. -What what's like?

19:28.876 --> 19:30.752
What it's like to have things.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.049
-You finish school?
-Yeah.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.221
Well I didn't.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.558
You might be happy
where you are.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.020
But this is all I'm
ever going to be.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.523
I came here with nothing.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.903
-And I'm going to be leaving
with nothing. -What you have, my
friend, is not nothing.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.219
-You know that happens
automatically, right? -Huh?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.891
Come on. Let's go.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.059
Where?

22:32.100 --> 22:33.894
Out.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.730
-Out where?
-Come on!

22:53.080 --> 22:55.123
Hey, one from your billboards,
yeah? You wanna try?

22:56.416 --> 22:58.043
It looks expensive.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.212
Expensive? Hi, could I please...

23:02.089 --> 23:03.131
...have a taste of this
Natural Strawberry?

23:04.132 --> 23:05.759
-Of course.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.763
This guy has to give us
as many tastes as we want.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.724
Until we make up our minds.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.435
-Right?
-Yeah.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.733
Can I please have
the Pralines & Cream?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.277
Good choice, my favorite.

23:44.423 --> 23:48.301
Something for you then?

23:50.011 --> 23:52.055
Nah mate. I'm
lactose intolerant.

24:43.815 --> 24:47.694
Oh, that's the one, huh?

24:47.736 --> 24:50.113
Let's go check it out.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.741
No?

24:55.535 --> 24:57.204
Suit yourself.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.900
-Guess how much it is.
-How much?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.945
460,000.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.955
-It's easy, you know?
-What?

26:22.998 --> 26:24.958
-To take the watch.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.128
Yeah.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.088
They make demo models.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.757
All we gotta do is
get our hands on one.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.010
Mmhmm.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.848
Then what you do is, you
go into the store, right?

26:39.889 --> 26:41.641
You pretend you're buying.

26:41.683 --> 26:42.976
-Yeah?
-Right, right.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.812
You...

26:48.148 --> 26:50.650
You distract the
sales agent. Right?

26:51.776 --> 26:53.320
-It's so big.
-Yeah!

26:55.030 --> 26:57.157
Make the switch - the demo
for the real thing - and then:

26:58.867 --> 27:02.162
You just fucking walk
out the front door.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.664
Hey, how
much is the demo?

27:05.540 --> 27:07.626
-How much you got?
-Huh?

27:13.423 --> 27:15.133
Nah man. You can't afford it.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.642
How'd you do that?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.187
I'm serious man.

28:35.171 --> 28:38.800
-Caweys?
-Hi!

28:38.842 --> 28:40.552
Um, can I speak to
you for a second?

28:47.308 --> 28:51.938
I spoke to Ayman.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.941
Oh.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.777
Sorry about the sales job.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.613
It's okay. Hospital bills
going up, that's all.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.241
Hospital bills?

29:03.283 --> 29:05.034
Um. Mother.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.123
No wife.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.964
Thank you.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.651
You know what real
money looks like?

29:41.946 --> 29:43.156
That guy.

29:46.159 --> 29:50.121
You know what's
in his bag? Cash.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.379
We could do it.

29:58.421 --> 30:00.173
Do what?

30:00.882 --> 30:02.509
-Take it.
-Take it?

30:02.550 --> 30:05.637
Take it.

30:05.678 --> 30:09.766
These guys carry anywhere
between 50,000 to 90,000
dirhams.

30:12.393 --> 30:13.937
-Fifty-fifty.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.358
- That's tempting.
-Yeah. It is.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.863
I'm not like that.

30:23.905 --> 30:27.700
Honest day's work.
Honest day's wage.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.079
Good luck.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.172
Hello beautiful.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.051
-You need to get a woman.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.762
-I already found a woman.
-Huh?

30:49.430 --> 30:51.641
And she can type without
looking at her hands.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.896
I can also do something
without looking at my hands.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.941
Okay, okay.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.610
I don't wanna know.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.199
Hey what's your day rate?

31:13.413 --> 31:14.789
Like how much money
do you make in a day?

31:19.377 --> 31:21.170
You make what? 1,500 a month?

31:21.796 --> 31:23.756
1,800.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.675
1,800.

31:27.218 --> 31:31.806
So that's... 70
dirhams a day. Yeah?

31:43.359 --> 31:45.737
You're worth more
than that, aren't you?

31:46.487 --> 31:48.656
Apparently not.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.251
That's my wallet!

32:02.462 --> 32:03.963
300?

32:05.798 --> 32:08.176
What'll I get for 300?

32:08.718 --> 32:10.637
That's my money.

32:10.678 --> 32:11.804
I like that one.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.147
Let me get my wallet!

32:27.028 --> 32:28.321
Hey Ramu.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.323
Jimmy.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.743
-No box. No charger?
-No man.

32:34.535 --> 32:36.829
-200.
-200?

32:38.289 --> 32:39.999
This is a new model.
This is dual sim. 600.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.835
-250.
-550.

32:42.877 --> 32:44.671
-300.
-300 is good.

32:46.798 --> 32:47.924
-Who's the guy?
-Intern.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.676
500.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.260
-400.
-450.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.054
-Jimmy. 400.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.310
400.

33:00.728 --> 33:02.355
Hey hey hey. Watch it.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.691
-Hey, Ramu.
-Hmm?

33:04.732 --> 33:06.859
When you wash your face,
where do you stop?

33:06.901 --> 33:08.486
Here right at the back.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.078
Here's your money, man.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.211
That's almost two days
of your life. Two days.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.548
Being poor isn't up to you, man.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.053
Staying poor is a choice.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.023
Hello?

35:53.025 --> 35:55.945
Hey. Hi. My friend, he lost
his sunglasses somewhere.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.201
Where did you lose them?

36:02.243 --> 36:05.788
-Um
-He must have dropped them
around somewhere in the mall.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.790
The security, they
told us to come here.

36:08.541 --> 36:09.667
Yeah, Lost and Found.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.507
-What kind of sunglasses?
-Aviators. Right? Yeah.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.888
What color?

36:21.929 --> 36:22.930
Silver.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.280
Sorry, they're not here.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.115
What? But they told us...

36:41.157 --> 36:42.909
-The frame is silver.

36:45.119 --> 36:49.332
Ma'am. Black lenses.
Silver frame.

36:49.373 --> 36:52.251
-Yeah. What he said.
Black lenses. Silver frame.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.843
-Try them on.
-Really?

37:00.885 --> 37:02.762
Yeah.

37:17.485 --> 37:22.323
Hey! You
look good, man.

37:22.365 --> 37:25.117
Thanks. I like it.

37:31.832 --> 37:35.503
Nah. You keep them.
They're yours.

37:37.171 --> 37:38.965
-But they're somebody else's.
-No, you earned them man.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.553
If you don't know how
to take care of what you have...

37:44.595 --> 37:46.264
Then you don't deserve it.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.648
There's so much stuff
just lying around.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.942
All you have to
do is pick it up.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.754
What the fuck are you doing man?

38:18.796 --> 38:19.964
Nothing.

38:24.051 --> 38:26.012
Shall we get the
fuck out of here?

38:36.564 --> 38:38.566
Hey. One more off the list.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.068
What's left? What do we got?

38:43.863 --> 38:45.906
-The car.
-The car. Yeah.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.034
Yeah man, the car.

38:49.452 --> 38:50.828
They didn't let me drive though.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.874
I don't have a license, so
they didn't let me drive.

38:55.624 --> 38:56.917
They didn't let you?

39:06.927 --> 39:09.221
They
didn't let me drive.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.850
Stupid mother fucker.

39:48.677 --> 39:50.554
Hey, you. Who are you?

39:52.306 --> 39:53.599
I'm the new guy.

39:58.687 --> 40:01.065
Go get that car. Park in the
basement. Bring the keys with
the tag, give them to me.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.650
Okay!

40:03.818 --> 40:05.111
Welcome to the W Hotel.

40:49.572 --> 40:50.906
Welcome to the W Hotel.

40:52.199 --> 40:54.118
Here's your card.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.733
What the hell were
you thinking, Caweys?

43:30.774 --> 43:32.151
They fired me.

43:32.401 --> 43:33.902
-Of course you got fired.

43:34.820 --> 43:35.904
You're lucky you're not in jail.

43:39.283 --> 43:40.909
-I can't get another job here.
-So go home.

43:42.828 --> 43:44.663
Take care of your mother.

43:56.342 --> 43:58.344
With what money?

43:58.385 --> 44:00.512
You'll find a job back home.

44:00.554 --> 44:03.349
Not one that pays enough.

44:03.390 --> 44:08.854
Caweys. 30 days here is more
expensive than 30 days back
home.

44:11.523 --> 44:13.525
Don't stay here and get
yourself into more trouble.

44:15.986 --> 44:17.696
You have the potential
to be so much more.

44:22.868 --> 44:24.870
Go home.

48:10.012 --> 48:12.014
So what are you gonna do, man?

48:12.639 --> 48:14.766
I don't even have a job.

48:14.808 --> 48:16.435
Who's talking about a job, man?

48:17.436 --> 48:18.604
You got 30 days.

48:20.564 --> 48:21.773
You can take whatever you want.
You can do whatever you want.

48:24.151 --> 48:25.777
Look what that got me.

48:35.829 --> 48:37.748
-I can't even pay my bills.
-What bills?

48:50.469 --> 48:52.137
What bills, man?

48:59.269 --> 49:01.021
Hey...

49:01.855 --> 49:03.315
My mom's medical bills...

49:06.610 --> 49:08.153
I send money to her every month.

49:11.531 --> 49:13.742
And now I'm short 600.

49:20.415 --> 49:21.625
600?

49:24.670 --> 49:26.630
I messed up, man.

49:33.095 --> 49:35.347
Done.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.182
-What do you mean?
-Done.

49:39.434 --> 49:41.186
Come on.

51:00.432 --> 51:01.850
Time to go.

51:04.144 --> 51:05.312
Is that enough?

51:08.732 --> 51:09.941
I don't think so man.

51:12.903 --> 51:13.945
Caweys.

53:27.370 --> 53:29.122
Shh!

53:29.414 --> 53:30.957
Relax. It's no problem.

53:32.584 --> 53:34.252
Let's get out of here man.

53:38.465 --> 53:39.925
You're the boss.

55:45.508 --> 55:47.218
2,825.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.307
Thank you, man.

56:22.504 --> 56:23.963
-Relax, Mr. Jimmish.

56:29.844 --> 56:31.096
You'll get your money.

56:39.896 --> 56:43.108
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

56:48.321 --> 56:51.282
I'm out of town for
the next three days.

56:51.324 --> 56:53.618
I will be leaving your
passport with Mr. Anwar.

56:55.745 --> 56:58.039
He will be expecting your call.

56:58.623 --> 57:00.792
And the money.

57:06.631 --> 57:08.967
Call him. Before I get back.

57:10.635 --> 57:13.680
If not, then I assure you...

57:13.721 --> 57:16.641
The next time I see you
will be the last time.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.979
Where you going?

58:03.021 --> 58:05.273
Somewhere those assholes
can't find me.

58:06.191 --> 58:07.567
How much you owe them?

58:10.737 --> 58:12.697
65,000.

58:18.161 --> 58:19.829
I can't pay them back and
I can't leave until I do.

58:24.417 --> 58:26.711
They have my passport, man.

58:34.260 --> 58:35.929
I need your help, man.

58:44.646 --> 58:45.897
I need your help.

58:54.030 --> 58:57.575
You remember that guy, on
the bike? With the bag?

58:59.369 --> 59:00.703
He's gonna be here tomorrow.

59:02.914 --> 59:05.750
He's gonna have to park
his bike somewhere here.

59:07.418 --> 59:09.087
And then...

59:09.796 --> 59:12.840
He's gonna walk from shop
to shop... To shop to shop.

59:14.801 --> 59:17.178
-And then walk all the way back.
-So?

59:18.846 --> 59:20.098
That's the only
way to pay Darbaan.

59:23.434 --> 59:25.228
-Rob him?
-Yeah.

59:25.270 --> 59:26.437
Come on, man.

59:30.775 --> 59:33.236
-You know I'm not gonna do that.
-You saw what that guy did to me
today.

59:34.487 --> 59:36.114
If I don't pay, I'm done.

59:46.040 --> 59:47.792
Look.

59:50.044 --> 59:51.921
He has to come to
all of these shops.

59:52.797 --> 59:53.965
It's money off-the-books.

59:55.216 --> 59:57.135
Nobody can report it stolen.

59:58.261 --> 59:59.971
Nobody will come after us.
It's ours for the taking.

1:00:08.313 --> 1:00:09.981
Your mother needs how much?
Per month?

1:00:10.773 --> 1:00:12.567
-1,100.
-1,100.

1:00:14.861 --> 1:00:19.574
There's at least 80,000 dirhams
in that bag.

1:00:23.161 --> 1:00:24.329
You can have half.

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:28.875
That is three years
of hospital bills.

1:00:53.858 --> 1:00:54.984
How are we gonna do it?

1:00:57.904 --> 1:00:59.697
If I could do it I would
have done it already.

1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:04.035
I will be right here though,
man. I'll be right here.

1:01:04.077 --> 1:01:05.244
I'll be parked right
there in the car.

1:01:06.621 --> 1:01:08.247
If anything goes
down, I'll jump in.

1:01:09.332 --> 1:01:11.042
You'll need this.

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:14.212
-I'm not gonna hurt him.
-No, it's not for him.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:17.632
You slide it under the strap.

1:01:17.965 --> 1:01:19.801
You slide it under the strap,
you cut it loose,

1:01:23.346 --> 1:01:24.889
pull the bag, you run!

1:01:26.766 --> 1:01:29.227
-He's gonna chase me! -How fast
are you willing to run for
40,000 dirhams?

1:01:35.525 --> 1:01:36.567
It just don't feel right, man.

1:01:46.577 --> 1:01:47.912
Please.

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:25.825
I'm not gonna hurt him.

1:05:14.243 --> 1:05:15.953
-Hey, hey!

1:05:22.418 --> 1:05:23.628
-Leave him alone!

1:06:23.729 --> 1:06:28.275
Late night flight available,
1,270 dirhams.

1:06:28.317 --> 1:06:29.527
Nothing before that?

1:06:32.154 --> 1:06:33.864
Book it.

1:06:39.829 --> 1:06:41.497
-Tomorrow is cheaper.
-Tonight.

1:07:07.064 --> 1:07:08.774
Hello?

1:09:33.252 --> 1:09:34.545
-They're not here for you.

1:09:37.131 --> 1:09:38.716
Not yet.

1:09:41.969 --> 1:09:43.888
He's probably not even dead.

1:09:46.307 --> 1:09:47.725
Hey, don't you want your cut?

1:09:50.644 --> 1:09:52.605
From the heist?

1:09:53.022 --> 1:09:54.690
How much?

1:09:54.815 --> 1:09:55.900
460.

1:09:58.068 --> 1:09:59.737
Thousand.

1:10:01.697 --> 1:10:03.240
He didn't have that much.

1:10:11.916 --> 1:10:13.751
It's not the real thing.

1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:15.586
Not yet.

1:10:16.629 --> 1:10:18.589
-I'm going home, man.
-So am I.

1:10:18.672 --> 1:10:20.049
But not empty-handed.

1:10:20.090 --> 1:10:21.258
Wait.

1:10:33.479 --> 1:10:34.772
You paid Darbaan?

1:10:45.491 --> 1:10:47.660
I need your help man.

1:11:05.177 --> 1:11:07.054
You gonna walk out
the front door?

1:11:08.681 --> 1:11:11.684
One call from me and you
will never see your home again.

1:11:28.033 --> 1:11:29.827
So.

1:11:35.332 --> 1:11:38.252
You're going to walk that watch
into the store and you're going
to walk the real thing out.

1:11:54.018 --> 1:11:56.145
-What makes you think they're
going to leave me alone with
that watch even for a second?

1:11:56.186 --> 1:11:58.105
-Looking like that, they won't.

1:12:02.443 --> 1:12:03.902
Another one from your list.

1:12:06.447 --> 1:12:08.240
You're welcome.

1:12:09.199 --> 1:12:11.035
It's easy.

1:12:12.036 --> 1:12:14.538
Walk in. Make the
switch. Walk out.

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:18.250
Then meet me at the
fountain at 10:00.

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:22.254
Then you're free.

1:16:41.430 --> 1:16:43.181
You just walked in, made
the switch, walked out?

1:17:01.158 --> 1:17:02.993
I like you, Caweys.

1:17:07.873 --> 1:17:09.583
Oh...

1:17:15.172 --> 1:17:16.840
What now?

1:17:21.678 --> 1:17:23.472
Run.

1:18:37.129 --> 1:18:38.213
Take it.

1:18:42.509 --> 1:18:44.261
Here.

1:18:58.150 --> 1:19:00.277
Man.

1:21:19.708 --> 1:21:22.168
Your day rate has
definitely gone up.

1:21:24.629 --> 1:21:26.256
Give me the watch.

1:21:27.883 --> 1:21:29.551
Take it.

1:21:29.593 --> 1:21:31.011
Give me the watch!

1:22:05.045 --> 1:22:06.755
Hello?

1:22:23.647 --> 1:22:24.814
The guy might still be in the
building. We got robbed. Half
a--

1:22:34.032 --> 1:22:35.659
I know what the guy looks like.

1:22:35.700 --> 1:22:37.160
If I go right now--

1:24:15.759 --> 1:24:17.260
Let's go.

1:25:26.454 --> 1:25:27.413
Where
are you going?

1:25:27.455 --> 1:25:28.790
Mogadishu.

1:25:32.585 --> 1:25:33.962
Why your
visa is cancelled?

1:25:34.003 --> 1:25:35.171
My mother, she's sick.

1:25:39.634 --> 1:25:41.177
- What's
in your pocket?

1:25:44.556 --> 1:25:46.141
Show me what's in your pocket.

1:26:24.053 --> 1:26:25.889
-Have a safe flight.
-Thank you.

1:26:48.119 --> 1:26:49.245
Oh fuck.

1:26:54.542 --> 1:26:55.752
Hello, Mr. Jimmish.

1:27:24.405 --> 1:27:26.115
Hello, welcome.

1:27:26.157 --> 1:27:27.951
Hi.

1:27:28.243 --> 1:27:29.577
Mr. Caweys, welcome aboard.

1:27:31.287 --> 1:27:33.081
This will be your seat.

1:27:33.122 --> 1:27:34.582
Thank you.

1:28:03.528 --> 1:28:05.655
-Hi, I'm Neeraj.
-Caweys.

1:28:06.656 --> 1:28:07.991
Going home?

1:28:08.032 --> 1:28:09.826
Yes.

1:28:10.535 --> 1:28:11.619
-Vacation?

1:28:13.162 --> 1:28:14.664
Permanent vacation.

1:28:16.207 --> 1:28:17.917
You didn't like it here?

1:28:25.466 --> 1:28:26.592
I liked it too much.

1:28:31.180 --> 1:28:32.515
All passengers
and cabin crew should now be
seated with their seatbelts
securely fastened.
