[grunts]

05:22.413 --> 05:24.034
of the shopping cart protocol's
limit.

05:27.793 --> 05:29.344
- Literally never.
- A bag full of sausages?

05:44.379 --> 05:47.413
- Oh, I should've known
he took it.

06:11.655 --> 06:13.551
[animal whines]

06:13.620 --> 06:15.103
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:15.172 --> 06:17.172
I have a great idea for a chain
of restaurants:

06:17.241 --> 06:19.758
you're inside
a giant wedge of cheese

06:19.827 --> 06:21.793
and you have
to eat your way out.

06:21.862 --> 06:25.655
I call it T.G.I. Parmesan.

06:31.413 --> 06:33.310
- No, no, no, turtles.

08:24.689 --> 08:27.517
- Hmm.
Your name is Meat Sweats?

08:27.586 --> 08:29.896
- Well, actually, it's Rupert.

08:29.965 --> 08:33.758
- Oh, I would
stay with Meat Sweats.

08:51.551 --> 08:52.482
[all groan]

08:52.551 --> 08:54.689
You never let me shine!

08:54.758 --> 08:56.689
Harpoon hooks it is.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.103
- Okay, Sweaty Spaghetti,
give us our dad back!

09:05.172 --> 09:07.000
- Yeah, hand over the fugitive.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.000
- Don't snitch me out, bro.

09:09.931 --> 09:11.827
- I don't think so.

09:11.896 --> 09:14.379
You have a reservation
in my stomach,

09:14.448 --> 09:16.034
a party of five,

09:16.103 --> 09:17.758
seating now.

09:19.068 --> 09:20.862
- Ooh, is he finally
gonna teach us

09:20.931 --> 09:22.827
how to make that pork risotto?

09:22.896 --> 09:26.413
- Since I assume you
won't go down without a fight,

09:28.689 --> 09:30.310
[laughs]
[snake hisses]

09:30.379 --> 09:33.000
- He's getting
the mutant snake's power.

09:34.482 --> 09:35.413
- Hey, watch out!

09:35.482 --> 09:36.517
It's a spitting cobra!

09:36.586 --> 09:38.689
- Hey, watch the paint, bucko!

09:38.758 --> 09:40.827
[tires squealing]
[both grunt]

09:40.896 --> 09:42.862
- Donnie, what else you got
in this thing?

09:42.931 --> 09:44.862
- Ooh, I've been wanting
to try this.

09:47.344 --> 09:48.344
[beeps]

09:51.413 --> 09:52.689
- [chuckles]

09:55.310 --> 09:57.206
- [groans, blubbers]

10:00.379 --> 10:01.655

[both grunting]

10:07.241 --> 10:09.689
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no!

10:09.758 --> 10:11.689
[both yelling and grunting]

10:11.758 --> 10:13.206
Mikey, stop 'em!

10:15.344 --> 10:17.517
- Huh?

10:17.586 --> 10:18.793
[growls]

10:19.896 --> 10:23.206
- Come on, Meat Sweats,
are you even trying?

10:26.068 --> 10:28.241
Come on, portal.
Come on, portal.

10:28.310 --> 10:31.344
- Come on, Leo!
My armpits are getting tired!

10:31.413 --> 10:32.931
- Hmm.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.379
Got it.

10:36.448 --> 10:38.034
- Hmm?

10:38.103 --> 10:40.034
Gah!

10:40.103 --> 10:41.655
- Let's get him!

10:44.551 --> 10:46.758
I'll just get takeaway.

10:46.827 --> 10:49.206
[animals screech and hiss]
- Ah!

10:49.275 --> 10:52.758
[tires screeching]

10:52.827 --> 10:55.379
[animals scream and hiss]

10:55.448 --> 10:57.689
[whimpers]
Whew.

11:01.344 --> 11:03.758
No meal is worth this!

11:03.827 --> 11:08.206
- Wait! Wait! Don't leave me!

11:08.275 --> 11:09.827
[chuckles]

11:09.896 --> 11:14.241
- You! You reckless,
irresponsible--

11:14.310 --> 11:15.758
You are watching

11:15.827 --> 11:17.206
the Science of Chairs Channel
for a month, young man!

11:17.275 --> 11:18.724
Followed by
the Long Division Channel

11:18.793 --> 11:20.068
and the Memorizing Pi Channel!

11:20.137 --> 11:22.724
