08:05.919 --> 08:08.253
"Photoshoots on the trip
to like,

08:08.355 --> 08:10.822

- Ew.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.124
- I haven't felt this feeling
in three years.

08:13.227 --> 08:16.661
I mean, I haven't really
had a serious love interest

08:16.763 --> 08:18.263
since Jojo.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.431
- JULIETTE: Oh, right.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.932
- ROBBY: After that,
it was kind of hard--

08:21.034 --> 08:23.468
- Forgot about that
for a minute.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.504
- CHLOE: I just feel like
Juliette's so naive.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.372
- Is she completely clueless
with this--at this point?

08:27.474 --> 08:28.740
- CHLOE: I think so.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.976
Like, you barely know this guy.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.477
- ROBBY: When I see you,
I wanna go get it.

08:32.579 --> 08:36.615
I dive in, headfirst.
Emotions on my sleeve.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.116
'Cause I love you.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.285
- What? Wait, really?
- Yeah.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.588

- This is actually where we go
to like, Mother's Day,

08:59.940 --> 09:01.773
Father's Day...

09:01.875 --> 09:03.375
- JULIETTE: The last time
Madisson's new boyfriend

09:03.477 --> 09:06.978
was in Siesta Key,
he was basically our boss.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.615
Now, he's re-meeting
Madisson's dad as her boyfriend.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.816
- Jon, how are you? Ish.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.685
Nice to meet you again.
It's been a while.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.120
It's been a while.
- Yes, it has.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.489
- JULIETTE: I actually feel
really bad for Madisson's dad.

09:17.591 --> 09:22.027
The whole thing is just
really...uncomfortable.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.328
- So what's new with you?

09:23.430 --> 09:28.166
- Well, now that I'm back
from LA...um...

09:28.268 --> 09:31.403
kind of just wanted to
update you on life.

09:31.505 --> 09:32.804
- Mm-hmm. On life.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.474
- MADISSON: Which involves Ish.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.144
Yeah, we are together.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.847
- Uh-huh.
- MADISSON: And...it's...

09:42.950 --> 09:46.685
getting pretty serious.
- Mm-hmm.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.654
My first question of many,
would be...

09:49.756 --> 09:53.425
how the heck old are you?
- 46.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.760
- How old is she?
- 25.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.195
- [exhales]

09:57.297 --> 10:00.765
- Okay, well, I'm 66,
so you're closer to me

10:00.867 --> 10:02.167
than you are to her.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.271
I mean, I don't know, it's--

10:06.373 --> 10:08.139
kinda get me
between the eyes here.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.507
- ISH: I get it,
but what relationship

10:09.610 --> 10:11.242
doesn't have problems?
- But this one has

10:11.345 --> 10:14.379
such an initial problem,
that she's embarrassed

10:15.382 --> 10:16.581
- I don't know that she's
toembarrassed--.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.250
- I'm not embarrassed,
but I'm nervous because I want

10:19.353 --> 10:21.486
to always make you
and mom proud.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.522
- I'm in a bit of a state
of shock right now.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.858
I'm trying to be delicate here,
but honestly,

10:26.960 --> 10:30.128
it's not what I would
want for her.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.896
I mean, is he a father
figure to you?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.164
- Eh. No.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.466
- JON: Is my opinion
important to you?

10:34.568 --> 10:36.167
- That's why--
- JON: It is important, then.

10:36.269 --> 10:40.472
- Yes, very much so.
- At 25, she should be free,

10:40.574 --> 10:43.274
enjoying life, experiencing
all there is to experience,

10:43.377 --> 10:44.776
which you can only do
in your 20s.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.778
- I do agree with that,
I do want her to get the most

10:46.880 --> 10:49.214
out of her 20s and all those
life experiences that come--

10:49.316 --> 10:52.183
- Well, I appreciate your
sincerity in that,

10:52.285 --> 10:55.220
and so I think I owe you
my sincerity,

10:55.322 --> 10:58.323
to say that at this point
I'm not convinced

10:58.425 --> 11:00.925
that this is in my daughter's
best interest.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.130
You do not have
my approval on this.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.464
- Okay.
- You don't.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.266
I think it's a mistake.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.268
Too old.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.569
This guy's gonna be
an old man

11:11.672 --> 11:12.737

thinking about that right now.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.042
- No, that's what you're here
for, you are thinking about it

11:17.144 --> 11:18.910
and you are thinking that
this is something

11:19.012 --> 11:20.779

to something permanent,

11:20.881 --> 11:23.081

really called her.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.771

31:22.248 --> 31:23.180
"[bleep] Juliette."

31:23.282 --> 31:25.015
- You are surrounding
yourself

31:25.117 --> 31:27.517

that are using you.

- CHLOE: You wanna talk outside?
- JULIETTE: Yeah.

31:40.299 --> 31:43.433
- CHLOE: [sighs] Well,
in my mind, I've laid awake

31:43.535 --> 31:45.769
at night and I just have
so many things

31:45.871 --> 31:47.170
I need to say to you.

31:47.273 --> 31:50.908
- I know you do. I know you.

31:51.010 --> 31:54.311
- Well, I have a question
to start, if you don't mind.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.347
How do you view our
friendship?

31:59.118 --> 32:00.550
- JULIETTE: I don't even know
how to answer that

32:00.653 --> 32:02.719
because it's so complicated.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.756
Before I was ever
friends with Chloe,

32:05.858 --> 32:07.357
Alex and Chloe
were best friends.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.927
- Girls are always going--
in their minds--still wanna

32:10.029 --> 32:11.628
hook up with you.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.230
- JULIETTE:
But Chloe wanted more.

32:13.332 --> 32:17.034
- Chloe told me that
she's in love with me.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.036
- JULIETTE: And when Alex and I
started dating...

32:19.138 --> 32:20.871
Do you want it to be
just you and me?

32:20.973 --> 32:22.739
...Chloe became my new
best friend

32:22.841 --> 32:24.041
and strongest defender...

32:24.143 --> 32:26.643
Welcome.
They're so pretty!

32:26.745 --> 32:28.445
...But then, Alex and I
break up

32:28.547 --> 32:30.881
and she's right back
on team Alex.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.616
- Well, Alex said all
he brought to Europe

32:32.718 --> 32:34.451
was camera, shorts and T-shirts.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.086
I was like, "Okay, well,
let me go get you

32:36.188 --> 32:37.888
some higher end stuff."

32:37.990 --> 32:39.256
- JULIETTE: I can't help
but wonder if Chloe

32:39.358 --> 32:41.291
was ever really my friend,

32:41.393 --> 32:43.927
or if our friendship was
just about Alex.

32:44.029 --> 32:47.030
I thought you were, like,
my older sister, where--

32:47.132 --> 32:49.700
- I was.
- --where we could fight

32:49.802 --> 32:51.601
and you would still be there.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.604
And that you wouldn't
betray me, no matter really

32:54.707 --> 32:57.374
what happened, you were
always gonna be there.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.810
- Okay, you're actually--
- Am I wrong?

32:59.912 --> 33:05.182
- No, you're actually not.
Um, I do feel like a big sister

33:05.284 --> 33:09.920
to you because, in a way,
where...I love you,

33:10.022 --> 33:11.788
and I always have,
you know that,

33:11.890 --> 33:16.393
and you can't deny that
I've shown you nothing but love.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.997
But I don't have any
other friendship in my life

33:20.099 --> 33:22.833
where I'm a big sister
to someone.

33:22.935 --> 33:27.104
And when I started
to think about you and I,

33:27.206 --> 33:31.608
I realized that it is
a one-way street.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.243
- Why do you feel that way?

33:33.345 --> 33:36.246
- Because you've never once
called me and asked me

33:36.348 --> 33:39.116
how I'm doing;
when you call me,

33:39.218 --> 33:41.718
you're going off the deep end
and you're upset--

33:41.820 --> 33:44.654
which, don't think that I've
said that I minded that,

33:44.757 --> 33:47.224
'cause I don't,
I loved being there for you--

33:47.326 --> 33:48.992
- So is this your excuse

33:49.094 --> 33:51.028
as to why you're friends
with Alex?

33:51.130 --> 33:52.262
- No, that's
completely separate.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.164
We're just talking about
our friendship.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.967
- No, you're just finding
an excuse as to why

33:57.069 --> 33:58.168
you can betray me.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.037
- Yes, okay,
you can view it that way,

34:00.139 --> 34:02.439
but that's not it.
- That's exactly what it is.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.141
- You've never once called me
and asked me how I'm doing,

34:04.243 --> 34:06.143
and you know what?
I said to Madisson,

34:06.245 --> 34:08.311
"For once, I'm not gonna
reach out to Juliette,

34:08.414 --> 34:10.414
I'm gonna see if she
reaches out to me."

34:11.483 --> 34:14.117
You've never once asked me
to go to dinner--

34:14.219 --> 34:16.019
- So therefore, you're like,
"[bleep] Juliette,

34:16.121 --> 34:18.388
let me go to the guy
that broke her heart."

34:18.490 --> 34:20.323
- You are gonna make it
about Alex because

34:20.426 --> 34:23.560
that's how you are, because
you think it's about you.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.862
It's really not, it's about
the fact that you haven't

34:25.964 --> 34:28.799
been a good friend to me.

34:28.901 --> 34:30.434
But with all that being said,

34:30.536 --> 34:34.171
I'm gonna give you one last
piece of friendly advice

34:34.273 --> 34:37.040
from someone that did view you
as a little sister

34:37.142 --> 34:39.943
and did really love you
and did really care.

34:40.045 --> 34:44.648
You are surrounding yourself
with people that are using you.

34:49.521 --> 34:53.557
- Bam! Congratulations,
you got it, Chloe.

34:53.659 --> 34:58.095
So, you...being friends
with Alex--

34:58.197 --> 35:01.364
- Juliette, my friendship
with you is completely

35:01.467 --> 35:03.300
separate from that.
- No, there's no friendship

35:03.402 --> 35:06.536
with us, apparently, 'cause
I thought we were good friends.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.605
- We were!
- Me! Me!

35:08.707 --> 35:11.408
- Get your [bleep] hand
[bleep] out of my face.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.244
[screams]

35:15.481 --> 35:16.746
- JULIETTE: Coming up--

35:16.849 --> 35:19.483
Shut up for one [bleep]--
- Don't tell me to shut up.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.351
- Then why did you break
her nose?

35:21.453 --> 35:23.253
- Because I got hit first.
- JULIETTE: And I can't?

35:23.355 --> 35:24.321
- AMANDA:
She didn't hit you first!

35:24.423 --> 35:25.322
- ROBBY:
But she spoke about people--

35:25.424 --> 35:26.990
- I'm not talking to you!

35:27.092 --> 35:28.558
Shut the [bleep] up.

35:30.195 --> 35:32.395
- There's no friendship
with us, apparently,

35:32.498 --> 35:34.197
'cause I thought we were
good friends.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.366
- We were.
- Me! Me! Me!

35:36.468 --> 35:39.202
- Get [bleep] hand
[bleep] out of my face.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.205
[screams]
- Listen.

35:42.307 --> 35:45.775
Me not being friends
with you has nothing

35:45.878 --> 35:48.245
to do with--

35:48.347 --> 35:51.281
- Let go! Now! Let go!

35:51.383 --> 35:53.383
- Let go.
- AMANDA: Now! Let go.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.051
- ROBBY: Stop, let go, I got it.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.389
- Are we [bleep] five?
Like, literally?

36:01.460 --> 36:03.126
- You don't put your hands
on her!

36:03.228 --> 36:05.195
- You put your hands on her!

36:05.297 --> 36:09.166
- I'm asking you to stop!
I'm asking you to stop!

36:09.268 --> 36:10.967
- JULIETTE: You broke her nose!
I grabbed her hair!

36:11.069 --> 36:12.903
- AMANDA: Stop.
Juliette, calm down.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.304
- ROBBY: Let go of her.
- AMANDA: Stop.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.739
- ROBBY: Just breathe.
- JULIETTE: Step away.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.145
- MADISSON:
Chloe, are you okay?

36:24.383 --> 36:26.249
Dude, what happened?

36:28.387 --> 36:30.420
- No, but what happened?

36:30.522 --> 36:32.522
- I don't know, like--I just--

36:32.624 --> 36:34.758
I remember her being, like,
really aggressive, like--

36:34.860 --> 36:36.927
I was just telling her how
I don't feel like

36:37.029 --> 36:39.896
she's a good friend to me,
and, like, I just don't feel

36:39.998 --> 36:41.932
like she's surrounding herself
around the right people,

36:42.034 --> 36:45.235
she made it all about, like,
me being friends with Alex,

36:45.337 --> 36:46.836
and me betraying her,
that's all she made

36:46.939 --> 36:48.538
the conversation about,
and next thing I know,

36:48.640 --> 36:51.408
she was just hitting me--
- She hit you?!

36:51.510 --> 36:53.677
- I grabbed her hair.
- Juliette, she could hurt you!

36:53.779 --> 36:55.011
- JULIETTE: What are you
talking about?!

36:55.113 --> 36:57.614
- She could've [bleep] you up,
Juliette!

36:57.716 --> 37:01.451
- Feel my head. Ow.
- Oh, Chloe.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.087
- Do you feel that?
- There's a [bleep] huge bump.

37:04.189 --> 37:05.589
- AMANDA: If you put your
hands on her,

37:05.691 --> 37:06.523
she can beat your ass.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.059
- Why couldn't I have
[bleep] her up?

37:09.161 --> 37:10.594
- You couldn't, Juliette,
you just couldn't.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.562
- She was grabbing your hair.
- Hold on, let me poke Cara,

37:12.664 --> 37:13.897
I want Cara to come
and get us.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.332
- She was grabbing your hair.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.801
- [phone vibrating]

37:17.903 --> 37:19.436
- Hello?
- CHLOE: Dude, Juliette

37:19.538 --> 37:21.705
literally just hit me
in the head.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.406
- No, she [bleep] didn't.

37:23.508 --> 37:26.343
Ew, this girl is such
[bleep] trash.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.612
- CHLOE: Can you just
come get me and Madisson?

37:28.714 --> 37:30.480
- CARA: Yeah, I'll literally
leave right now.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.550
That was Chloe, um, Juliette
just hit her in the head.

37:33.652 --> 37:34.651
- VICTORIA: Are you [bleep]
kidding me?

37:34.753 --> 37:36.353
- Yeah, like, physically
attacked her.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.655
- I've been there with Chloe.
It's not worth it.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.257
Letting her get to you
at that point

37:40.359 --> 37:42.459
where you get physical
with her is not worth it.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.594
And it pisses me off that
she gets you to that point--

37:44.696 --> 37:48.498
- Hey, shut up for one [bleep]--
- Don't tell me to shut up.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.433
- Then why did you break
her nose?

37:50.535 --> 37:52.302
- Because I got hit first.
- JULIETTE: And I can't?

37:52.404 --> 37:53.870
- Did she hit you first?

37:53.972 --> 37:56.573
Did she put her hands
on you first? Did she?

37:56.675 --> 37:57.741
- ROBBY: No, but she spoke
about--

37:57.843 --> 37:59.175
- I'm not talking to you!

37:59.278 --> 38:00.710
Did she put her hands
on you first?

38:00.812 --> 38:02.112
- ROBBY: We're kind
of a package deal now.

38:02.214 --> 38:03.380
- Shut the [bleep] up.
- JULIETTE: Hey!

38:03.482 --> 38:06.416
- Did she put her hands
on you first, yes or no?

38:06.518 --> 38:09.552
- I don't know.
Why are you mad at me?

38:09.655 --> 38:11.988
- Because I'm tired of
this [bleep]!

38:12.090 --> 38:13.690
- What [bleep]?!
What did I do?!

38:13.792 --> 38:15.191
- AMANDA: You grabbed her
by her hair!

38:15.294 --> 38:18.695
- What did I do?!
What did I do?!

38:18.797 --> 38:21.665
- ROBBY: Yes, Juliette.
- JULIETTE: What did I do?!

38:21.767 --> 38:23.833
- Don't [bleep] clap,
Mr. [unintelligible].

38:23.935 --> 38:25.135
- You were my friend!

38:25.237 --> 38:26.569
You wanna get your ass
beat too?!

38:26.672 --> 38:28.238
You were my [bleep] friend!

38:28.340 --> 38:30.440
- You wanna put your [bleep]
hands on me?! I dare you!

38:30.542 --> 38:32.709
- You're not on my side,
now get the [bleep] out.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.912
- They were here--
- You're not on my side anymore

38:36.014 --> 38:38.815
apparently, fake-ass bitch.
- --you [bleep] kidding me?!

38:38.917 --> 38:41.251
- You know Chloe betrayed me--
- Juliette.

38:41.353 --> 38:43.453
- JULIETTE: You know.
You were my friend!

38:43.555 --> 38:44.587
- Can you get out of our house?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.589
I'm not trying to get
in any trouble.

38:46.692 --> 38:50.493
- Yes! Yes!
- JULIETTE: Get the [bleep] out!

38:50.595 --> 38:53.730
- JARED: Stop antagonizing her!
- [bleep] go!

38:53.832 --> 38:57.133
- JARED: Juliette. Juliette.
- JULETTE: Get the [bleep] out!

38:57.235 --> 39:00.704
- [indistinct arguing]

39:03.408 --> 39:05.175
- BRANDON: Relax, relax,
she ain't gonna do [bleep].

39:05.277 --> 39:06.710
- Robby, don't antagonize her,
dude.

39:06.812 --> 39:07.811
- ROBBY: I'm sticking up
for her, brother.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.646
- You're just clapping
in the background.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.081
- It's her house
and she'll get out.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.882
- I understand that,
but we're here!

39:12.984 --> 39:14.551
Don't antagonize her.

39:14.653 --> 39:16.519
- Please get out of the house,
I don't wanna cause a scene.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.722
- Let's go, come on.
- [bleep] put her hands on me.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.523
- KELSEY: Please, leave.
- AMANDA: No, I'm not leaving

39:20.625 --> 39:22.025
without my phone--
- BRANDON: Alright, come on.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.727
[bleep] You know they're gonna
break your nose, [bleep] that,

39:23.829 --> 39:26.563
you don't wanna do that.
