00:33.453 --> 00:36.656
- Whoa, baby.
- You caught nothing.

00:36.789 --> 00:39.826
You're gonna have to move away.

00:39.959 --> 00:43.043
We don't want no cheap-seaters
around the table.

00:43.171 --> 00:48.165
- If Kenny's movin', you've got to move.
- You follow him, Bobby.

00:48.301 --> 00:51.302
Would you go
if you had the chance again?

00:51.429 --> 00:54.098
- Would I go? Yeah.
- You'd go to Canada?

00:54.223 --> 00:56.512
- No, not to Canada.
- You'd go back to 'Nam?

00:56.642 --> 00:58.682
- Yeah, because...
- You would?

00:58.811 --> 01:00.851
- You're a fucking psycho!
- No.

01:00.980 --> 01:05.559
- You'd go back?
- Yeah. I went over for a purpose, man.

01:05.693 --> 01:08.647
- What was your purpose?
- A lot of it was curiosity.

01:08.780 --> 01:12.564
- But another thing was...
- You can't be curious, man.

01:12.700 --> 01:17.695
I said that was just part of the reason.
The other was a moral obligation.

01:17.830 --> 01:25.126
I feel that anybody... Not for their country
or anything like that. For anybody.

01:25.254 --> 01:29.382
Nobody's got the right to tell anybody
what to do against their will.

01:29.509 --> 01:32.047
That's what I went over to fight for.

01:32.178 --> 01:37.219
Did you know that they ran the French
out of there after 20 years?

01:37.350 --> 01:42.854
Wait a minute. You said they're forcing...?
Shit! You call the draft not being forced?

01:42.980 --> 01:45.020
I ain't sayin' the draft in our country.

01:45.149 --> 01:50.274
I'm talking about another country that's
having something forced upon them.

01:50.404 --> 01:55.991
- Is it our duty to fight for somebody else?
- If you believe in it! If you believe in it.

01:56.118 --> 02:02.157
I can't see anybody saying that,
after coming back, they would go again.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.450
I just can't deal with that.

02:04.585 --> 02:09.543
Wait a minute. The reason I can see it
is that some of us, not all of us,

02:09.674 --> 02:14.632
some of us need to justify to ourselves
what the fuck we did there.

02:14.762 --> 02:20.005
If we come back and say what we did
was a waste, some of us can't live with it.

02:20.143 --> 02:23.558
- So they'd do it again?
- Man, they gotta keep...

02:23.688 --> 02:26.772
Inside they're lying to themselves
continuously saying

02:26.899 --> 02:31.312
"What I did was OK
because this is what I got from it, man."

02:31.445 --> 02:36.688
"I have to justify being paralysed, I have to
justify killing people, so I say it was OK."

02:36.826 --> 02:39.696
But how many guys
can make the reality and say

02:39.829 --> 02:44.206
"What I did was wrong
and all this other shit was wrong, man"

02:44.333 --> 02:48.794
and be able to live with themselves cos
they're crippled for the rest of their life?

02:51.090 --> 02:54.708
<i>You don't know what's going on</i>

02:54.844 --> 02:58.544
<i>You been away for far too long</i>

02:58.681 --> 03:04.020
<i>You can't come back</i>
<i>and think you are still mine</i>

03:05.104 --> 03:08.639
<i>You're out of touch, my baby</i>

03:08.774 --> 03:12.558
<i>My poor discarded baby</i>

03:12.695 --> 03:18.614
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

03:20.286 --> 03:27.333
<i>Well, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

03:27.460 --> 03:33.996
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

03:34.425 --> 03:37.130
<i>You are all left out</i>

03:40.139 --> 03:42.808
<i>Out of there without a doubt</i>

03:42.934 --> 03:48.094
<i>Cos baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

03:51.692 --> 03:55.441
<i>A girl who wants to run away</i>

03:55.571 --> 03:59.320
<i>Discovers that she's had her day</i>

03:59.450 --> 04:03.614
<i>It's no good you thinking</i>
<i>that you are still mine</i>

04:05.665 --> 04:09.116
<i>You're out of touch, my baby</i>

04:09.251 --> 04:13.545
<i>My poor unfaithful baby</i>

04:13.673 --> 04:18.833
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

04:20.680 --> 04:27.014
<i>Well, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

04:27.770 --> 04:34.852
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

04:34.986 --> 04:37.227
<i>Yes, you're all left out</i>

04:40.491 --> 04:42.982
<i>Out of there without a doubt</i>

04:43.119 --> 04:48.409
<i>Cos baby, baby, baby, you're out of time</i>

04:52.128 --> 04:55.960
<i>You thought you were a clever girl</i>

04:56.090 --> 04:59.376
<i>Giving up your social whirl</i>

04:59.510 --> 05:03.722
<i>But you can't come back</i>
<i>and be the first in line</i>

05:03.848 --> 05:06.090
<i>Oh, no</i>

05:06.225 --> 05:09.808
<i>You're obsolete, my baby</i>

05:09.937 --> 05:13.555
<i>My poor old-fashioned baby</i>

05:13.691 --> 05:19.445
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

05:21.032 --> 05:27.319
<i>Well, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

05:28.247 --> 05:35.210
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

05:35.337 --> 05:37.959
<i>Yes, you're all left out</i>

05:41.010 --> 05:43.631
<i>Out of there without a doubt</i>

05:43.763 --> 05:48.923
<i>Cos baby, baby, baby, you're out of time</i>

05:51.771 --> 05:57.725
<i>Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time</i>...

06:03.783 --> 06:06.155
<i>Re-box all weapons.</i>

06:06.285 --> 06:09.571
<i>Place your weapons on the firing line</i>
<i>with the dust covers up.</i>

06:09.705 --> 06:12.030
<i>Grease up the brass</i>...

06:12.166 --> 06:15.499
Word is it's turning into
a hell of a war over there, Captain.

06:15.628 --> 06:20.788
We're going there, pal.
When we're in 'Nam, we're in Combat City.

06:20.925 --> 06:24.341
I am ready. Really ready.

06:25.805 --> 06:28.841
I'll pop some rounds with you. Marine!

06:30.392 --> 06:35.101
- How's Vi taken to your leaving?
- I think she hates everything military.

06:35.231 --> 06:39.275
But she stands behind me.
She knows I want it more than anything.

06:39.401 --> 06:42.237
- How about Sally?
- She's OK.

06:42.363 --> 06:46.989
I don't think she really understands it all,
but she accepts it.

06:48.077 --> 06:51.197
You can't ask
for a helluva lot more than that.

06:53.958 --> 06:58.833
<i>An American spokesman reported</i>
<i>rockets, artillery and mortar fire...</i>

06:58.963 --> 07:01.667
- Jeez!
- Remember Jim Hanson?

07:02.883 --> 07:07.130
He got blown away
in the middle of the street right in Saigon.

07:07.263 --> 07:12.304
That's an embarrassment.
Makes us look like the goddamn B Team.

07:12.434 --> 07:16.266
Word is from on top that Charlie
shot his wad with this Tet Offensive

07:16.397 --> 07:19.481
and it's just a matter of a mop-up time.

07:19.608 --> 07:22.977
I've waited a long time
for an opportunity like this.

07:23.112 --> 07:25.270
You're gonna make major.

07:26.615 --> 07:28.240
- Major?
- Major.

07:28.367 --> 07:34.655
Major and Mrs Robert Hyde? I'll have
to get my skirts lengthened for that one.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.830
Start wearing girdles.

07:36.959 --> 07:42.250
- You'll have to watch your language.
- Right. Very reserved.

07:43.340 --> 07:47.883
I'm actually excited.
I never thought it would get like this.

07:48.012 --> 07:54.513
I have competitive nervousness.
I feel like I'm off to the Olympic Games.

07:54.643 --> 07:56.683
Bob is very sexy.

07:56.812 --> 07:59.386
In 13 months I'll throw you
the damnedest party.

07:59.523 --> 08:02.809
We'll have a side of beef,
a case of Jack Daniels,

08:02.943 --> 08:05.980
and maybe I'll even get you
a couple of congressmen.

08:06.113 --> 08:07.691
Fantastic.

08:07.823 --> 08:10.907
- I'll bring you back a souvenir.
- Like what?

08:11.035 --> 08:13.822
A Commie AK-47.

08:13.954 --> 08:17.323
- Robert? Sorry to interrupt.
- Mrs Vickery.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.127
I wanted to pass on
the Colonel's best wishes.

08:20.252 --> 08:24.748
- Isn't he able to come by later?
- No. Tonight's his chess night.

08:24.882 --> 08:29.674
- Sally, be sure to keep in touch.
- I will, Mrs Vickery.

08:29.803 --> 08:32.472
- She'll be staying with my mom.
- Oh, nice.

08:32.597 --> 08:36.049
Earl, your Kathy's doing
a wonderful job on the paper.

08:36.184 --> 08:40.811
- Don't let it go to your head, young lady.
- I've got a lot of good ideas.

08:40.940 --> 08:42.979
Call me tomorrow.

08:44.526 --> 08:47.693
- May God be with you, Robert.
- Thank you, Mrs Vickery.

08:51.408 --> 08:53.448
That was very nice.

08:53.577 --> 08:57.160
<i>A time of innocence</i>

08:57.289 --> 09:02.117
<i>A time of confidences</i>

09:02.253 --> 09:05.752
<i>Long ago it must be</i>

09:05.881 --> 09:08.882
<i>I have a photograph</i>

09:09.009 --> 09:11.085
<i>Preserve your memories</i>...

09:11.220 --> 09:13.509
Now hear this!

09:14.598 --> 09:20.304
It is exactly zero hour minus six.

09:20.437 --> 09:24.221
Your orders for the day are:

09:24.358 --> 09:29.518
Go directly to the bedroom.

09:31.198 --> 09:34.947
Do not pass "Go".

09:35.077 --> 09:39.122
Do not collect dinner.

09:40.624 --> 09:44.040
- Aren't you hungry?
- Well...

09:44.169 --> 09:47.455
Does a bear make big potty in the woods?

09:49.883 --> 09:54.592
From the Halls of Montezuma
to the shores of Tripoli...

09:58.058 --> 10:00.596
I will fight...

10:02.396 --> 10:05.480
my country's battles...

10:07.568 --> 10:10.403
on land,

10:10.529 --> 10:12.652
in the air...

10:33.761 --> 10:35.800
Bob?

10:39.350 --> 10:41.556
What are you doing?

10:41.685 --> 10:44.770
This darn thing wouldn't pop up.

10:46.190 --> 10:50.437
You never know
when you're gonna want some toast.

11:00.954 --> 11:03.410
I gotta start getting ready.

11:04.792 --> 11:08.243
You don't need to be afraid
for me, you know.

11:09.797 --> 11:12.003
I <i>am</i> afraid.

11:13.842 --> 11:16.084
But I'm proud of you.

11:16.220 --> 11:20.134
There was nothing I could do
here in California.

11:20.265 --> 11:22.305
I know.

11:23.977 --> 11:28.390
That's where I belong. And I am a Marine.

11:31.610 --> 11:35.109
I gotta go. Pay the bar bill.

11:35.239 --> 11:38.904
And let's get the generator
in this thing fixed.

11:39.034 --> 11:42.118
And call my mom and let her know
when you're coming.

11:42.246 --> 11:46.908
- I bought you a present, sweetheart.
- I don't have anything for you.

11:54.091 --> 11:57.590
Oh, Sally. It's a little wedding ring.

12:00.639 --> 12:04.553
Look how outstanding that is. Huh?

12:04.685 --> 12:06.724
I like it.

12:08.480 --> 12:13.226
- You'll probably take it off on liberty.
- No way.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.776
I'll never take this off. That's a promise.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.653
- This'll be my good-luck charm.
- That's right.

12:22.786 --> 12:26.404
Sir? We're ready to move out.
Can I stow your gear?

12:27.624 --> 12:30.162
- We're at war.
- Yo!

12:33.505 --> 12:35.545
Let's go.

12:36.842 --> 12:41.753
When I get back, we're gonna get us
a little condominium right on the beach.

12:41.889 --> 12:43.965
Tell brother Billy to take care.

12:44.099 --> 12:48.227
- And a garage filled up with Porsches.
- Be a good girl. No fooling around.

12:48.353 --> 12:51.604
- Just come back.
- You got it.

12:51.732 --> 12:54.649
Oh. This is Dink. My wife Sally.

12:54.777 --> 12:59.023
Hello, Mrs Hyde. Vi, Captain Hyde's wife.

12:59.156 --> 13:01.195
Hi, Vi.

13:02.618 --> 13:05.025
Be careful.

13:05.162 --> 13:07.914
- You have a spot on your tie.
- What?

13:21.094 --> 13:23.764
Don't wear your skirts so short.

13:50.832 --> 13:52.872
See you around.

14:04.721 --> 14:06.548
- Hey, Vi?
- Yeah?

14:06.682 --> 14:09.967
Do you want a drink?
Can I buy you a drink or something?

14:10.102 --> 14:12.141
Where's open? No place is open.

14:12.271 --> 14:15.770
- Just the Officers Club.
- Any place but there.

14:19.403 --> 14:21.479
Yeah, I guess.

14:22.447 --> 14:25.733
Well... that's that.

14:34.543 --> 14:38.623
Hey. I live just a couple of miles down.
Wanna come over?

14:38.755 --> 14:41.044
- Yeah.
- Stay close.

14:48.765 --> 14:52.099
- Park in there. It's empty.
- OK.

15:01.695 --> 15:05.858
Don't mind the mess. Come on up.

15:17.377 --> 15:19.417
Don't turn it off.

15:43.862 --> 15:45.902
OK?

15:46.031 --> 15:51.701
Yeah. Sorry. Just tonight especially,
I felt superstitious.

15:51.828 --> 15:54.913
Whatever gets you through the night.

15:55.040 --> 15:59.038
- I guess it's the way I was brought up.
- Me too. Is beer OK? It's all I got.

15:59.169 --> 16:01.209
Oh, sure.

16:08.970 --> 16:11.971
You gonna stay on in officers' quarters?

16:12.099 --> 16:15.016
Are you kidding?
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

16:15.143 --> 16:18.393
- That's spooky.
- Bob moves off and I've gotta move.

16:18.522 --> 16:22.519
You're the hole in the doughnut, and
when the doughnut goes, there's no hole.

16:22.651 --> 16:28.404
They say if the Marine Corps wanted you
to have a wife they'd have issued you one.

16:28.532 --> 16:31.201
- Is that you?
- Me and my kid brother.

16:31.326 --> 16:32.951
He's cute.

16:33.078 --> 16:37.407
He inherited the brains,
the beauty, the personality, the talent.

16:37.541 --> 16:39.165
Then he got drafted.

16:39.292 --> 16:41.700
He's the main reason I hang out here.

16:41.837 --> 16:43.876
- Not Dink?
- Dink the kink?

16:45.173 --> 16:51.093
He's part of it. But the kid's
in the VA hospital - psycho ward.

16:51.221 --> 16:55.883
They sent him home without an ignition.
So I'm stuck with him.

16:56.977 --> 17:00.346
God. It must be really hard on you.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.893
I see him every day.
I work in the hospital, in the kitchen.

17:05.026 --> 17:07.814
Is he gonna get better?

17:07.945 --> 17:10.781
Who knows? They don't.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.865
I don't.

17:26.757 --> 17:29.757
- Hey, Pee Wee.
- How are you doing, Mr Martin?

17:29.885 --> 17:33.882
I'm just fine, Pee Wee. Just terrific.
I only stink a <i>little</i> bit.

17:34.014 --> 17:36.968
- Smells like booze to me.
- I need a bath, man.

17:37.100 --> 17:40.185
I just have two hands
and too many assholes to clean.

17:40.312 --> 17:42.351
That's what you're being paid for.

17:42.481 --> 17:45.766
Mr Martin, you get more from Uncle
for your disability

17:45.901 --> 17:48.189
than me and my old lady get put together.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.902
Maybe they shouldn't
put you together, then.

17:52.032 --> 17:55.116
- Your radiator's blowing over.
- So's yours, Eddie.

17:55.243 --> 18:00.404
I'm serious, man. You better watch it
before you pop your melon.

18:00.540 --> 18:04.158
Oh, shit. I'm filled up. Where's Corinne?

18:09.174 --> 18:12.792
You better watch that booze.
Mess up your kidneys.

18:29.653 --> 18:33.318
Watch where you're...! Goddamnit! Shit!

18:33.448 --> 18:36.402
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

18:38.078 --> 18:41.447
Would you please give me my canes?

18:41.581 --> 18:43.621
I'm sorry.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.790
Goddamnit!

18:47.003 --> 18:54.050
Nurses, interns and orderlies!
Fucking nurses and fucking doctors!

18:54.177 --> 18:57.712
They treat us like nobodies
in this fucking hospital!

18:57.848 --> 19:01.548
- Goddamn it! Where are you people?
- Give it hell, Luke.

19:01.685 --> 19:06.347
Corinne, you're fucking late!
There's something on the floor for you!

19:06.481 --> 19:09.316
You stay where you are, Digroot!

19:09.442 --> 19:14.151
You come near me, I'll break
your fucking head! You understand?

19:14.281 --> 19:17.946
Where the fuck were you? You're
so goddamned slow. Can't you move?

19:18.076 --> 19:22.537
Come near me! I wanna hit you! I wanna
hit something that can't fucking move!

19:22.664 --> 19:24.704
What am I saying?

19:24.833 --> 19:27.288
What am I doing?

19:30.172 --> 19:33.256
- Having a little problem today, Luke?
- Oh, shit!

19:33.383 --> 19:36.004
Doctor, I can't even
get my piss bag changed!

19:36.136 --> 19:39.587
- You want me out of this hospital?
- Give him 50 of Thorazine.

19:39.723 --> 19:45.808
Take care of me and I'll get the fuck
out of here! Just take care of me!

19:47.272 --> 19:52.183
Fucking hospital! Aw, shit!

19:59.576 --> 20:04.368
<i>Put me on a train</i>

20:04.497 --> 20:09.705
<i>I've got no expectations</i>...

20:11.713 --> 20:14.584
- Are you Fleta Wilson?
- Yes.

20:14.716 --> 20:20.635
I think I'd like to volunteer. I mean,
I don't think, I do want to volunteer.

20:20.764 --> 20:22.258
Damn.

20:22.390 --> 20:26.305
Sit down, please.
I'll be with you in a minute.

20:31.149 --> 20:33.189
Hot stuff.

20:47.832 --> 20:50.205
- Do you have him, Jerry?
- Yeah.

20:50.335 --> 20:52.374
One, two, three.

20:58.551 --> 21:02.549
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But you'll get used to it.

21:02.681 --> 21:06.595
One guy had "Born to lose"
tattooed on his arm.

21:06.726 --> 21:09.893
<i>"La vida loca"</i> - the crazy life.
That's my favourite one.

21:10.021 --> 21:12.856
I talked to this other guy
that had a gold earring.

21:12.983 --> 21:17.111
Yeah? You're not used
to those hippy types, huh?

21:17.237 --> 21:21.566
Bob would flip out
if he ever saw those characters.

21:22.450 --> 21:25.451
That about does it, huh?

21:25.578 --> 21:30.287
I feel like I've lived in base houses
all my life.

21:32.877 --> 21:34.953
Should've had the government move us.

21:35.088 --> 21:38.539
- They do that for officers, you know?
- Yeah?

21:38.675 --> 21:42.423
I didn't realise that we'd accumulated
so much stuff.

21:42.554 --> 21:46.219
Well, don't worry. My rates are cheap.

21:47.767 --> 21:52.762
You know, I think I must have moved
at least 15 times since I left home.

21:52.897 --> 21:57.440
I went back there once
when my old lady died.

21:57.569 --> 22:02.112
Nothing's left. They tore down my past
and built a shopping centre.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.407
- Want to see something funny?
- I'd love to.

22:05.535 --> 22:07.575
My yearbook.

22:10.707 --> 22:13.827
- Ooh! Look at that dress.
- It was a nice dress.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.166
- It's cute.
- There's another one here.

22:16.296 --> 22:18.668
So funny looking at
the way we used to look.

22:18.798 --> 22:22.048
- Doggy in the window?
- Look.

22:24.012 --> 22:27.345
"Sally Bender. Nickname: Sal."

22:28.683 --> 22:32.515
"What is the one thing
she'd want on a desert island?"

22:32.645 --> 22:34.852
"A husband."

22:34.981 --> 22:38.682
- I was so ambitious.
- And so original.

22:38.818 --> 22:42.686
You know that guy we were talking about?
He's in here somewhere.

22:42.822 --> 22:45.064
- Yeah?
- Look.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.773
"Luke Martin. Nickname: The Duke."

22:47.911 --> 22:51.196
- He's cute.
- "Co-captain of the football team."

22:51.331 --> 22:55.744
"What one thing would he want
on a desert island? A mirror."

22:55.877 --> 23:00.586
- This is asinine, Pee Wee.
- There you go. Take some.

23:00.715 --> 23:04.962
Don't you get the feeling
that this is kinda silly shit?

23:13.144 --> 23:17.890
Shit, I'm not saying
this isn't entertaining, Pee Wee.

23:19.651 --> 23:23.067
I'm not eating, Pee Wee. I'm not eating.

23:24.572 --> 23:27.776
I'm not eating, Pee Wee. Come on, man.

23:27.909 --> 23:32.785
Give me my arms. I can feed myself.
This is bullshit. I'm not a child, man.

23:32.914 --> 23:34.954
Drink the milk.

23:48.388 --> 23:51.472
- Hi there.
- Hello.

24:00.358 --> 24:02.398
Juice and coffee!

24:03.361 --> 24:05.401
Want some juice?

24:08.324 --> 24:11.409
Excuse me. Do you want
some juice or coffee?

24:12.579 --> 24:15.615
- Juice or coffee?
- Look at that round-eyed chick!

24:15.748 --> 24:17.788
Come on, baby, light my fire.

24:19.419 --> 24:23.582
- Wanna boom-boom? Short time?
- Like some juice?

24:23.715 --> 24:26.502
I'm hard all over.
I'm a bargain in this ward.

24:26.634 --> 24:30.086
Hey, man, be cool. I told you.
Get yourself together.

24:30.221 --> 24:35.346
- Do you want some juice?
- Tits... ass... You got it all, Mama-san.

24:35.476 --> 24:38.181
- You got it all.
- Hey, you shut up.

24:38.313 --> 24:43.817
Yes, sir. Right away. You hear that?
You're disturbing these young 'uns.

24:43.943 --> 24:47.395
Can I kiss you? Can I sniff? Oh, man.

24:50.950 --> 24:52.990
Luke?

24:54.913 --> 24:56.952
Can I come in?

24:59.959 --> 25:02.201
How are you doing?

25:08.051 --> 25:12.048
- Do you remember me?
- No.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.671
I was at Lincoln High
when you were there.

25:14.807 --> 25:19.766
Sally Hyde. Well, I was Sally Bender
when... when I was there.

25:21.773 --> 25:23.812
So?

25:28.321 --> 25:30.693
I just started volunteering today here.

25:30.823 --> 25:34.868
Terrific. If I could get my hands loose,
I'd salute you.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.040
You're a mess.

25:46.047 --> 25:48.620
- Sally Bender.
- Right.

25:50.426 --> 25:55.088
- You were a cheerleader.
- That's right. Three years.

26:00.853 --> 26:04.139
- Were you wounded in 'Nam?
- Right.

26:04.274 --> 26:06.978
When did it happen?

26:08.987 --> 26:11.026
A long time ago.

26:13.825 --> 26:18.368
- My husband just went over there.
- Poor bastard.

26:31.426 --> 26:33.465
Sally?

26:34.721 --> 26:38.339
Didn't we used to call you Bender Over?

26:38.474 --> 26:42.686
- What? Who said that?
- Bender Over. Everybody said it.

26:42.812 --> 26:45.813
- They did not!
- Yes, they did, Sally.

26:45.940 --> 26:49.689
Oh, come on. They did not.
What are you talking about?

26:49.819 --> 26:51.859
Oh, shit.

26:51.988 --> 26:55.155
Sally, listen.
Can I ask you for a big favour?

26:55.283 --> 26:57.322
Sure.

26:57.452 --> 27:01.532
How about unhitching me
from these things?

27:02.832 --> 27:05.916
- No, I can't do that, Luke.
- Sure you can. It's easy.

27:06.044 --> 27:09.993
No, I'm sorry. The doctor
has to do that. I...

27:10.131 --> 27:13.547
Come on. Please? Please, Sally Bender.

27:18.639 --> 27:20.928
- Come on.
- What are you doing in here?

27:21.059 --> 27:24.262
- I just was seeing...
- We'll tend to Mr Martin, Sally.

27:24.395 --> 27:27.182
- You're needed on the ward.
- OK.

27:28.941 --> 27:33.153
Hey, Bender.
You almost got yourself a gold star.

27:41.454 --> 27:43.696
Pee Wee, I can crawl again.

27:52.006 --> 27:54.046
Morning.

27:55.677 --> 28:01.382
I'm gonna be feeding you this morning.
I'm a new volunteer here.

28:01.516 --> 28:03.555
Huh?

28:06.604 --> 28:12.191
He ain't transistorised, honey.
You gotta plug him in for sound.

28:12.318 --> 28:14.358
Plug you in? Oh.

28:19.450 --> 28:22.321
Is this... is this gonna hurt?

28:25.832 --> 28:28.038
There. Is that OK?

28:29.252 --> 28:32.668
- Thank you.
- OK. Would you like some food?

28:33.756 --> 28:36.591
Hey, there you go. Oh, my.

28:36.717 --> 28:38.757
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.926
You want me to...? Here.

28:41.055 --> 28:43.095
Here. Here you go.

28:45.685 --> 28:48.555
It's all energy. You understand?

28:49.772 --> 28:53.224
You don't understand.
You give out energy, you get energy back.

28:53.359 --> 28:57.191
You see me smiling?
Can you dig them pearly whites?

28:57.321 --> 29:00.239
I smile my ass off now.

29:00.366 --> 29:04.494
Hell, sometimes I think
I'm the Good Humor Man.

29:04.620 --> 29:08.748
Everyone wants a piece of my action.
They think I'm one of the Beach Boys.

29:08.875 --> 29:13.335
- Hey, Sally. This is my brother, Bill.
- Hi, Bill.

29:15.339 --> 29:19.882
You see that? Me and her just had
a whole conversation in smile contact.

29:20.011 --> 29:24.305
- Vi, do you have a jumper cable?
- Sure. Bridges!

29:24.432 --> 29:26.471
Watch. You watching?

29:30.730 --> 29:33.980
You two just did it. You smiled
"See what I have to put up with?"

29:34.108 --> 29:36.148
And she smiled back "He's harmless."

29:36.277 --> 29:38.483
- Are you on uppers?
- I don't know.

29:38.613 --> 29:42.029
Come on, Bill.
How about a game of chess?

29:44.243 --> 29:47.861
My brother -
a miracle of modern medicine.

29:51.250 --> 29:56.327
Hey, wait. Oh, my God, what a day.
Is he usually like that?

30:03.763 --> 30:05.174
Try it!

30:08.059 --> 30:10.098
Is it charging?

30:14.815 --> 30:16.689
No.

30:16.817 --> 30:21.776
I like this one.
This is beautiful. It's a convertible.

30:23.032 --> 30:29.781
I don't know how you'd keep warm.
Oh, it's got a great sound system.

30:29.914 --> 30:31.112
Hello.

30:31.249 --> 30:35.163
- Why is this one so much less expensive?
- It's two years older.

30:35.294 --> 30:41.463
"I'm so tired when I come home at night,
I just fall right asleep."

30:41.592 --> 30:44.427
"I know you didn't want me
to get a job..." Thanks.

30:44.554 --> 30:51.600
"...but this isn't really a job, since
I don't get paid. I hope you don't mind."

30:51.727 --> 30:56.639
Then there's sort of a sexy ending.
"Love, Sally."

30:56.774 --> 30:59.443
- That's nice.
- Thanks.

31:01.821 --> 31:06.483
But you didn't tell him the house
you rented was on the beach.

31:06.617 --> 31:08.491
I know.

31:09.537 --> 31:13.237
And you didn't tell him
about the new car you bought.

31:13.374 --> 31:17.123
I figure I'm gonna save that
for when he gets home.

31:19.422 --> 31:23.254
- I got one from Dink this morning.
- Oh, yeah?

31:23.384 --> 31:28.461
All he said was "Got you another ear."
Poetic, huh?

31:29.765 --> 31:35.352
A captain? Shit, Bender. You didn't
go out and marry a fucking captain?

31:35.479 --> 31:38.813
That's right. Why? What were you?

31:38.941 --> 31:40.981
A sergeant.

31:41.110 --> 31:44.313
Sergeants have a lot
of responsibility, don't they?

31:44.447 --> 31:47.448
Yes. They sent me my stripes
on the hospital ship.

31:47.575 --> 31:50.576
My reward for getting so fucked up!

31:51.412 --> 31:54.828
Why are you so cynical about that, Luke?

31:56.292 --> 31:59.827
What are you doing here, Bender?
Why aren't you on a golf course?

31:59.962 --> 32:02.749
Doing something you're good at.

32:02.882 --> 32:04.921
I'm just trying to keep busy.

32:05.051 --> 32:07.506
Sure. Something
to talk about over martinis.

32:07.637 --> 32:10.922
How you're helping out the poor cripples.

32:13.142 --> 32:16.593
I don't think that
I deserve that, Luke - at all.

32:16.729 --> 32:21.687
Maybe you're getting ready for your
husband to come back in a body bag.

32:28.199 --> 32:30.026
Read someplace else!

32:32.745 --> 32:34.784
Luke?

32:34.997 --> 32:37.037
Luke.

32:40.419 --> 32:42.745
Stop! Stop and listen to me!

32:45.800 --> 32:48.172
What is the matter with you?

32:52.682 --> 32:55.386
Why do you have to be such a bastard?

33:08.864 --> 33:12.814
Kevin. I thought
you died Wednesday, man.

33:12.952 --> 33:17.495
You can get paralysed in a war
that don't even make sense

33:17.623 --> 33:21.952
and come back and they don't have
the decency to ask you how you're doing.

33:22.086 --> 33:24.209
"Can I do anything for you?"

33:24.338 --> 33:29.629
I got a Purple Heart. I got it from a second
lieutenant that wasn't even in the war.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.845
They don't tell you about
how to manage your finances.

33:32.972 --> 33:37.301
Or going back into society. Half
the people still can't go back into society.

33:37.435 --> 33:41.135
What about your sex life?
They don't tell you about that.

33:41.272 --> 33:44.059
I went out the first time
and didn't know what to do.

33:44.191 --> 33:48.770
What happens if my gizmo busts? What
happens if I have a bowel movement?

33:48.904 --> 33:51.360
I get there and I don't know how to react.

33:52.241 --> 33:55.028
There's not enough beds,
not enough staff.

33:55.161 --> 33:58.031
It's really crowded.
The guys have to wait in line.

33:58.164 --> 34:01.663
They're not prepared for the number
of wounded being sent back.

34:01.792 --> 34:05.292
I don't think we're clear
on what you're asking us for, Sally.

34:07.173 --> 34:12.629
It's what I said. We could do an article
in the paper, using these photographs,

34:12.762 --> 34:15.217
interviewing some of the guys, maybe.

34:15.347 --> 34:18.099
Isn't it difficult for the men
to be around women?

34:18.225 --> 34:21.594
When I joined Weight Watchers
I didn't want candy in the house.

34:21.728 --> 34:24.136
I don't think that's our function, Sally.

34:24.273 --> 34:28.022
We're more a base gossip sheet.
Fun and games for the fellas.

34:28.152 --> 34:32.813
I agree with you, Connie.
I'm sorry, Sally. I hope you understand.

34:32.947 --> 34:36.697
What's next in the agenda?

34:36.827 --> 34:42.201
We have the Little League play-offs
and the officer-son baseball game.

34:42.333 --> 34:45.868
That's the 25th and the 27th, isn't it?

34:46.003 --> 34:49.123
I just... I want to say
that I'm really shocked

34:49.255 --> 34:53.503
that you'd rather write about
a goddamn home run than this hospital.

34:53.636 --> 34:57.550
- Sally, please.
- What if they were your husbands?

35:04.271 --> 35:07.142
<i>That sure is a mindblower!</i>

35:07.274 --> 35:10.026
<i>That's the way it was done 150 years ago</i>.

35:10.152 --> 35:14.197
- <i>Things have improved</i>.
- <i>They certainly have</i>.

35:14.323 --> 35:20.741
<i>Picture a young man 150 years ago</i>
<i>in the beautiful hills of Kentucky</i>.

35:20.871 --> 35:24.205
<i>There's a girl he's crazy about</i>.
<i>She's lovely, vivacious</i>...

35:24.333 --> 35:26.824
What's shaking, man?

35:26.961 --> 35:32.335
One of them days, man.
Flashback to when I got fucked up.

35:34.969 --> 35:37.008
<i>Wow!</i>

35:38.180 --> 35:41.430
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

35:53.445 --> 35:58.107
<i>Nobody feels any pain</i>

35:59.952 --> 36:04.329
<i>Tonight as I stand inside the rain</i>

36:06.333 --> 36:09.168
<i>Everybody knows</i>

36:09.295 --> 36:12.379
<i>That baby's got new clothes</i>...

36:14.008 --> 36:21.635
<i>He dedicated himself to justice and</i>
<i>love between his fellow human beings</i>.

36:23.934 --> 36:26.223
<i>He gave his life for that principle</i>

36:26.353 --> 36:30.896
<i>and I think it's up to those of us</i>
<i>who are here</i>...

36:35.029 --> 36:39.358
It was a choice between dealing with that
or dealing with this football game

36:39.491 --> 36:42.991
and they just said it's not our function.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.528
Maybe I'm naive.

36:47.082 --> 36:49.870
Naive? She wants to know if she's naive!

36:50.002 --> 36:52.707
- Oh, man. That's cold.
- I'm a cold man.

36:52.838 --> 36:55.709
It's like you've done your duty,
served your purpose,

36:55.841 --> 36:59.506
so they just toss you into the heap
like a used Kleenex.

36:59.637 --> 37:01.676
That's the way it is. That's it.

37:01.805 --> 37:06.598
What is our function if it isn't to deal with
the problems you guys face every day?

37:06.727 --> 37:09.763
God! The smugness just...
I can't believe it.

37:09.897 --> 37:12.851
- Give 'em hell, Bender.
- Sorry.

37:12.983 --> 37:16.399
It's not gonna do any good,
but I'm rooting for you.

37:16.528 --> 37:19.316
Well, thanks a lot, Luke.

37:19.448 --> 37:22.235
Seriously, if they put
something in the paper...

37:22.368 --> 37:25.701
You're beautiful when you're excited.

37:28.582 --> 37:33.244
<i>Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit</i>

37:35.089 --> 37:38.090
<i>When we meet again</i>

37:38.217 --> 37:41.301
<i>Introduced as friends</i>

37:41.428 --> 37:47.099
<i>Please don't let on</i>
<i>that you knew me when</i>

37:47.226 --> 37:52.469
<i>I was hungry and it was your worid</i>

37:52.606 --> 37:56.651
<i>Ah, you fake just like a woman</i>...

37:56.777 --> 38:01.024
God only knows
what he saw over there... or did.

38:03.325 --> 38:08.071
I don't understand it.
He was only in 'Nam for two weeks.

38:08.205 --> 38:11.241
I worry a lot about Dink too.

38:11.375 --> 38:15.538
He's so funny, you know?
So uncomplicated.

38:15.671 --> 38:18.244
He's more than just a roll in the sack.

38:20.092 --> 38:23.176
I just hope he doesn't get totalled.

38:28.225 --> 38:31.559
Whoo!

38:36.400 --> 38:38.439
I got it.

38:41.363 --> 38:44.649
- Bender!
- You got a chair!

38:44.783 --> 38:48.484
- You changed your hair!
- You like it?

38:48.620 --> 38:52.155
- Yeah. It's very nice.
- You're mobile.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.414
- I'll help you. Go ahead.
- Thanks, Luke.

38:54.543 --> 38:56.583
- Hi, Rick.
- Hey, Luke. How you doing?

38:56.712 --> 38:58.751
Congratulations.

39:11.769 --> 39:14.438
Would you like to come over for dinner?

39:14.563 --> 39:17.647
Wouldn't you like to
get out of here one night?

39:17.775 --> 39:19.814
I'm a good cook.

39:22.071 --> 39:24.110
OK?

39:25.240 --> 39:29.570
<i>("Jumping Jack Flash"</i>
<i>by the Rolling Stones}</i>

39:38.587 --> 39:40.627
<i>Watch it</i>

39:45.803 --> 39:50.299
<i>I was born in a crossfire hurricane</i>

39:52.392 --> 39:57.138
<i>And I howled at my ma</i>
<i>in the driving rain</i>...

40:17.960 --> 40:21.329
I hit him after the whistle, man!

40:21.463 --> 40:26.421
It was wrong! He grabbed my chair!
Didn't you grab my chair?

40:39.314 --> 40:43.229
Can't you morons kick a field goal?
Come on! Field goal!

40:46.613 --> 40:50.658
B- u-s-t! Bust 'em!

41:07.551 --> 41:11.880
And around about July 1st,
my pa's mind would start wandering.

41:12.014 --> 41:17.256
He wouldn't give a damn about the cattle,
and that got us kids pretty excited.

41:17.394 --> 41:20.348
At the park they'd have flags flying
and games of chance,

41:20.481 --> 41:23.018
kissing booths and wrestling matches.

41:23.150 --> 41:27.444
But let me tell you,
that day was always too long for me.

41:27.571 --> 41:31.699
When it got dark, the band
would play "The Star-Spangled Banner"

41:31.825 --> 41:33.865
and the fireworks would start up,

41:33.994 --> 41:38.490
and I'd start thinking how brave those
men were that fought in the Revolution.

41:38.624 --> 41:43.036
I'd dream about those men,
how they went to war for our freedom.

41:43.170 --> 41:46.040
I guess that's when I decided
to be a soldier,

41:46.173 --> 41:49.423
seeing the sky lit up with those rockets.

41:49.551 --> 41:51.591
I enlisted when I became of age.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.389
I served in Europe and Worid War Two

41:54.514 --> 41:58.049
and was involved in the liberation
of dozens of towns.

41:58.185 --> 42:02.183
As I passed through them,
as I saw the faces of the people,

42:02.314 --> 42:05.932
I realised I had fulfilled my dream.

42:06.068 --> 42:11.109
I had become one of those men
who had gone to war for freedom.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.157
I sure wound up doing
what I wanted to do,

42:14.284 --> 42:17.902
and that's what July 4th means to me.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.545
- I bet you can't do that.
- I can't do that. Can you do this?

42:33.387 --> 42:36.174
- No.
- Go on, try it.

42:38.475 --> 42:40.515
I can't do it.

42:40.644 --> 42:45.270
Hey, Billy the Kid. Let's show
these guys what real talent is. Come on.

42:45.399 --> 42:49.348
Give me your arm. You know,
the duet we worked up last night.

42:53.907 --> 42:58.320
- Billy, you gonna play that thing?
- Come on, Billy. Play your guitar.

42:58.453 --> 43:01.988
Come on. I love
when you play the guitar.

43:17.014 --> 43:22.435
What is tomorrow? What is it we need?

43:22.561 --> 43:25.431
What will it give us?

43:25.564 --> 43:27.936
A new life we can lead

43:28.066 --> 43:33.690
Will the wind crack the limbs
of a few dying trees?

43:37.200 --> 43:42.824
Will the branches unite
and bend in the breeze?

43:43.915 --> 43:48.577
Tomorrow is hope
for it is something I've not seen

43:49.713 --> 43:56.166
Tomorrow is a sunny day...
live in a sunny dream...

44:07.064 --> 44:10.148
Come on, Billy. That sounded great.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.200
Shit.

44:24.539 --> 44:27.659
I can't play my fucking guitar.

44:44.935 --> 44:47.177
God!

44:53.527 --> 44:55.899
It's all right, man.

44:57.239 --> 44:59.362
It's gonna be all right.

45:02.869 --> 45:07.827
I think it really helped him
having you there. I really do.

45:13.171 --> 45:15.413
Luke, are you OK?

45:16.967 --> 45:21.130
- Yeah.
- Should we do the dinner another night?

45:21.263 --> 45:23.302
No. No.

45:50.792 --> 45:54.576
I think you were really wonderful
with him. I really do.

46:06.767 --> 46:09.720
Oh, boy.

46:09.853 --> 46:13.685
Just come down here
and hold the chair for me.

46:16.151 --> 46:18.309
Thanks.

46:28.246 --> 46:30.618
You could pick my ankles up.

46:39.508 --> 46:42.508
Thank you. That's good. Thank you.

46:44.554 --> 46:46.594
It's warm because I've had the oven on.

46:46.723 --> 46:52.477
I've got one of those timing devices
that cooks your food while you're at work.

46:52.604 --> 46:54.643
Whoo.

46:56.399 --> 46:59.733
Let me just move you around a bit.

46:59.861 --> 47:02.732
- You like margaritas?
- Yeah.

47:02.864 --> 47:05.402
Well...

47:05.534 --> 47:08.653
I just happen to have some.

47:12.332 --> 47:14.621
Let me just...

47:18.421 --> 47:21.173
Do you get a chance to go out very much?

47:21.299 --> 47:24.917
- Do you go to people's homes?
- No, I don't.

47:31.184 --> 47:33.556
Let's go in the living room.

47:35.564 --> 47:37.936
I think you can make it. OK?

47:51.746 --> 47:53.822
Let's see. Um...

47:56.668 --> 47:59.373
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

47:59.504 --> 48:03.003
- What?
- What am I lighting a fire for?

48:04.384 --> 48:06.460
It's the old Girl Scout instinct.

48:06.595 --> 48:08.634
Let's see. I've got a dip...

48:11.683 --> 48:14.470
Sit down, Bender.

48:14.603 --> 48:16.642
Sit down.

48:20.567 --> 48:23.354
- Are you nervous?
-

48:23.486 --> 48:25.526
Yes.

48:27.616 --> 48:29.655
Why are you nervous?

48:32.329 --> 48:35.911
This isn't "Have a Gimp Over
for Dinner" Night, is it?

48:36.041 --> 48:38.828
You're not one of those weirdos?

48:43.214 --> 48:45.884
No, I'm not, Luke.

48:48.887 --> 48:50.926
I know you're not.

48:53.892 --> 48:58.055
I'm just very happy to be here.

49:04.611 --> 49:06.900
I'm glad you're here.

49:12.911 --> 49:15.069
How about some music?

49:16.498 --> 49:18.537
Well...

49:19.626 --> 49:23.955
I don't think you're gonna
like my records very much.

49:24.089 --> 49:26.959
You probably won't
like the way I dance either.

49:30.095 --> 49:33.049
Well...

49:35.350 --> 49:39.976
Do you know that when I dream,
I'm not in the chair?

49:40.105 --> 49:44.268
I don't even have a chair in my dream.
I have legs.

49:47.404 --> 49:52.315
When I was a kid, I used to jump
in my mother's kitchen

49:52.450 --> 49:54.988
and touch the ceiling.

49:55.120 --> 50:01.324
She used to get pissed off cos
I'd leave my handprints on the ceiling.

50:01.459 --> 50:05.327
I still check the snow reports,
the conditions at Mammoth.

50:05.463 --> 50:08.250
I'm still the same person, you know.

50:09.342 --> 50:12.711
It's funny.
When people look at me, they see...

50:12.846 --> 50:16.594
something else,
but they don't see who I am.

50:20.145 --> 50:24.605
I think people have a real hard time
seeing who other people really are.

50:24.733 --> 50:28.267
People don't see <i>me</i> like I really am.

50:28.403 --> 50:35.402
People look at me, I think, and they see
"Oh, cheery Sally, the captain's wife."

50:42.125 --> 50:47.166
Sometimes I feel like
I'm becoming what people see.

50:48.381 --> 50:52.379
You know, I spend 95 <i>/</i>
of my time at the hospital

50:52.510 --> 50:54.752
thinking about making love with you.

51:03.438 --> 51:06.937
I've never been unfaithful to my husband.

51:09.235 --> 51:16.401
<i>Do those who hear</i>
<i>think he's doing wrong?</i>

51:16.534 --> 51:23.153
<i>While the church bell</i>
<i>tolls its one-note song</i>

51:23.291 --> 51:29.910
<i>And the school bell</i>
<i>is tinkling to the throng</i>

51:31.466 --> 51:37.006
<i>Come here where your ears cannot hear</i>

51:38.306 --> 51:41.307
<i>And close your eyes, child</i>...

51:41.434 --> 51:45.135
- Don't wake him up.
- Hey. Doc?

51:46.314 --> 51:49.149
Wake up.

51:49.275 --> 51:52.561
We sail with the morning tide.

51:54.906 --> 51:58.156
- Hey, Doc. Why don't you go to bed?
- Hi, Sally.

51:58.284 --> 52:01.202
- Hi, Doc.
- You think you can make it, Doc?

52:01.329 --> 52:02.989
Sure.

52:04.999 --> 52:07.122
Smooth sailing, Doc.

52:09.295 --> 52:12.878
Hey... You want a ride?

52:13.007 --> 52:15.249
- Huh?
- You want a ride?

52:22.517 --> 52:27.558
- You sure I'm not heavy?
- I wouldn't know.

52:27.689 --> 52:29.183
Shh!

52:29.315 --> 52:34.061
- What are you doing?
- I don't know where to put my hands.

52:34.195 --> 52:36.354
Put them in your pockets.

52:41.578 --> 52:45.955
- Seems strange to be here at night.
- Not for me.

52:51.129 --> 52:58.045
<i>With eager tongues we taste our strife</i>

52:58.177 --> 53:04.263
<i>And fill our lungs with seas of life</i>...

53:06.019 --> 53:08.889
Thank you for the... for the ride.

53:09.022 --> 53:11.180
Thank you for the dinner.

53:12.275 --> 53:17.151
<i>And close your lips, child</i>

53:17.280 --> 53:21.574
<i>So softly I might kiss you</i>

53:21.701 --> 53:27.739
<i>Let your flower perfume out</i>
<i>and let the winds caress you</i>

53:28.833 --> 53:36.211
<i>As I walk on through the garden</i>
<i>I am hoping I don't miss you</i>

53:36.341 --> 53:41.583
<i>If all the things you taste</i>
<i>ain't what they seem</i>

53:42.138 --> 53:46.218
<i>Then don't mind me</i>...

53:46.768 --> 53:48.807
Good night.

53:52.106 --> 53:54.146
Good night.

53:56.736 --> 54:01.279
<i>Then close your eyes, child</i>

54:01.407 --> 54:05.701
<i>And look at what I'll show you</i>

54:05.828 --> 54:12.578
<i>Let your mind go reeling out</i>
<i>and let the breezes blow you</i>

54:12.710 --> 54:16.328
<i>Then maybe when we meet</i>

54:16.714 --> 54:21.092
<i>Suddenly I will know you</i>

54:21.219 --> 54:26.177
<i>If all the things you see</i>
<i>ain't what they seem</i>...

54:32.772 --> 54:35.310
This just came.

54:39.362 --> 54:41.734
Do you want me to stay?

54:42.824 --> 54:44.863
I'll be in my office.

54:56.462 --> 54:58.087
Vi?

54:58.214 --> 55:00.670
- Vi?
- Here!

55:01.634 --> 55:03.674
Orders from the front.

55:03.803 --> 55:07.089
We ate 200 gallons
of chicken noodle soup last week.

55:07.223 --> 55:09.928
How do you feel about
going to Hong Kong for a week?

55:10.059 --> 55:13.345
- Are you kidding?
- Bob and Dink just got their R and R.

55:13.479 --> 55:15.519
Oh, my God! Hong Kong?

55:15.648 --> 55:19.480
Will you check the plane schedules?
I gotta get my hair done, go to the bank.

55:19.610 --> 55:22.777
I think it's already tomorrow there.

55:23.990 --> 55:27.157
- A week?
- Well, five days.

55:28.536 --> 55:30.908
Well, I can't go.

55:33.875 --> 55:39.545
What am I supposed to do? Walk out
on my job? Walk out on my brother?

55:39.672 --> 55:41.712
I just can't, Sally.

55:44.761 --> 55:48.675
Yeah. I'm gonna miss you. So is Dink.

55:49.891 --> 55:53.509
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Yeah.

55:53.644 --> 55:56.598
- Give him a kiss from me.
- Right.

55:58.191 --> 56:00.230
On the cheek!

56:09.952 --> 56:14.164
Great shot. Great shot. My best pass.

56:18.252 --> 56:20.494
Oh! Great shot.

56:20.630 --> 56:23.880
Good play. You're out, you're out.

56:24.008 --> 56:26.760
Fucking in over your head!

56:26.886 --> 56:30.220
- Hey, Bender!
- No way. No way.

56:30.348 --> 56:32.886
Oh, that's my best shot!

56:34.227 --> 56:38.141
Good news.
I'm getting released on Thursday.

56:38.981 --> 56:41.852
- I'm getting out!
- That's great.

56:41.984 --> 56:44.985
- How you doing?
- Are you gonna stay with someone?

56:45.113 --> 56:49.821
I've got my own place.
I'm gonna have wheels. I'll be in touch.

56:49.951 --> 56:51.990
I owe you dinner.

56:57.375 --> 56:59.913
I'm not going to be around for a while.

57:00.044 --> 57:04.089
I just heard from Bob.
He's getting his R and R.

57:04.215 --> 57:07.299
I'm gonna be meeting him in Hong Kong.

57:10.430 --> 57:14.676
- Well, have a nice trip.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

57:17.520 --> 57:20.521
The iceman returns. Shoot it up.

57:20.648 --> 57:22.688
Luke!

57:26.863 --> 57:32.023
- Whoa. Look at that. Great shot.
- Come on. Put it in the hole.

58:17.914 --> 58:20.487
Over here. Over here.

58:20.625 --> 58:23.329
There you go. Over this way.

58:29.383 --> 58:34.129
Let's go. Move it up. Put it down, man.
Down, down.

58:35.723 --> 58:41.761
How you doing, Sally?
Hey, Vi. Where is she?

58:55.409 --> 58:59.241
Why did you have to go to work
in the hospital?

59:01.749 --> 59:05.248
- Because I wanted to.
- But it's the pits!

59:06.629 --> 59:08.918
You didn't have to do that.

59:13.177 --> 59:15.929
I just don't want you to work.

59:29.110 --> 59:34.780
I love my mama and my papa too

59:36.409 --> 59:39.908
I love my mama...

59:40.037 --> 59:43.453
I just don't understand it.
Five days. That's all I wanted.

59:43.582 --> 59:48.825
Is that too much to expect from somebody
you've been with for two years?

59:48.963 --> 59:55.167
Like... women and dogs, you've got to
have a licence to show you're the owner.

59:56.262 --> 01:00:02.881
Yeah. Thanks very much for all the advice.
I really appreciate it.

01:00:03.019 --> 01:00:06.553
Tell the head honcho
I'm going to the place across the street.

01:00:06.689 --> 01:00:08.847
- I'll see him later.
- I'm sorry.

01:00:08.983 --> 01:00:13.277
Oh, no. Thanks for everything. Excuse me.

01:00:13.404 --> 01:00:18.399
If you see Vi, thank her for me too.
Make sure of that, huh?

01:00:28.711 --> 01:00:32.874
What the fuck is the matter with him?
Where's he going?

01:00:33.007 --> 01:00:35.877
He's upset because Vi didn't come.

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:40.755
And because I suggested he didn't
have the right to order her over here.

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:45.848
- We gotta go get him.
- No, let's just be alone for a few minutes.

01:00:48.397 --> 01:00:50.437
We <i>are</i> alone.

01:00:51.567 --> 01:00:56.988
- There's something wrong.
- It's not you. It's just... fucked up.

01:00:57.114 --> 01:00:59.784
All this bullshit about 'Nam.
It's in my head.

01:00:59.909 --> 01:01:02.945
Talk to me about it.
I want to know what it's like.

01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:07.326
I don't know what it's like.
I only know what it is.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:09.830
The TV shows what it's like.

01:01:14.173 --> 01:01:17.756
It sure as hell don't show what it is.

01:01:30.481 --> 01:01:32.520
I gotta find him.

01:01:41.575 --> 01:01:44.113
Does she love me, Raul?

01:01:47.873 --> 01:01:50.245
- She loves me, man.
- I wouldn't let you down.

01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:54.290
- Those new heads'll work real good.
- I appreciate it. Have a good day.

01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:57.458
- Take her easy.
- All right, man.

01:02:14.984 --> 01:02:19.313
- How are my plants?
- They're fine. Nah, they died.

01:02:20.614 --> 01:02:23.734
- They died?
- Yeah. Sorry.

01:02:23.868 --> 01:02:25.907
What?

01:02:26.036 --> 01:02:29.619
- They died.
- Hey, man, I only got two plants.

01:02:30.791 --> 01:02:34.492
- What about that Kennedy assassination?
- What do <i>you</i> think about it?

01:02:36.422 --> 01:02:40.669
Hey, Sally, listen. I've made up my mind.

01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:43.886
You can tell the kid
I'll marry her if you want to.

01:02:44.013 --> 01:02:46.468
<i>You</i> tell her!

01:02:46.599 --> 01:02:50.181
Give me a break. I'm serious about this.

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:58.518
I've put it down all in writing and
I wanted you to kinda talk to her about it.

01:02:58.652 --> 01:03:04.904
- OK. OK, of course. I'd be glad to.
- OK!

01:03:05.034 --> 01:03:07.821
Would you have married me
if I wasn't a Marine?

01:03:07.953 --> 01:03:12.247
- In a second.
- What did I tell you?

01:03:12.374 --> 01:03:16.289
Didn't I tell you the uniform
always used to mean something?

01:03:18.964 --> 01:03:23.626
The entire structure
of the Marine Corps is changing.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.587
It used to really mean something
to be a Marine.

01:03:28.724 --> 01:03:32.722
We're no longer the elite.
We're not even equal.

01:03:35.064 --> 01:03:39.275
<i>Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday</i>

01:03:39.401 --> 01:03:43.648

Excuse me.

01:04:20.192 --> 01:04:22.232
Big hook.

01:04:25.864 --> 01:04:28.569
Hey, mister, can you walk?

01:04:28.701 --> 01:04:32.615
No, I can't walk.
That's why I'm in this chair.

01:04:34.498 --> 01:04:37.452
- What happened to you?
- Yeah. What happened?

01:04:37.585 --> 01:04:39.826
I got in an accident. I had a bad accident.

01:04:39.962 --> 01:04:43.247
I got a piece of metal in my back,
and after that I couldn't walk.

01:04:43.382 --> 01:04:46.833
- Mary, I'm gonna go around.
- I don't believe you.

01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:50.219
- What's the matter with kids today?
- We don't believe you.

01:04:50.347 --> 01:04:54.594
- What's the matter with you characters?
- I want a ride! I want a ride!

01:04:54.727 --> 01:04:59.554
OK. Come on. I'll give you a ride.
Here we go. Oops!

01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:04.435
Are you gonna help me out here?
Pull that back. That's it. That's good.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:08.947
It's all right, we got it. I'll show you
a way out if you don't want to pay.

01:05:13.871 --> 01:05:16.955
First week in combat... Huh!

01:05:18.751 --> 01:05:21.324
We took this little hamlet.

01:05:24.173 --> 01:05:31.006
I got this second lieutenant -
this fucking Camp Lejeune whizz kid.

01:05:33.015 --> 01:05:38.306
He comes whipping right up to me.
"Excuse me, sir. Sorry to bother you."

01:05:38.437 --> 01:05:41.640
"Do you think it'd be OK
if we put the heads on the poles?"

01:05:41.774 --> 01:05:45.474
"That really scares the shit out of the VC."

01:06:01.377 --> 01:06:03.416
My men...

01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:07.377
were chopping heads off.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:14.343
That's what they were into.

01:06:22.147 --> 01:06:24.187
Oh, they were dead.

01:06:28.237 --> 01:06:31.855

Do you like Tiger balm?
Makes you feel real cool.

01:06:57.641 --> 01:07:00.013
Let me put some on your back.

01:07:08.235 --> 01:07:13.395
Is that the way you massage
the basket cases at the hospital?

01:07:20.706 --> 01:07:23.493
<i>I stuck around St Petersburg</i>

It's open.

01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:51.149
Hi.

01:07:53.655 --> 01:07:57.071
- Where's Adrienne?
- Couldn't make it.

01:07:57.201 --> 01:08:00.118
She asked me to take her place.

01:08:00.245 --> 01:08:02.997
I was kind of counting on Adrienne.

01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:07.992
I've been around
this part of the pool before.

01:08:08.128 --> 01:08:12.874
- With a gimp?
- Yeah. A guy in Reno.

01:08:16.011 --> 01:08:18.680
- Do you want a drink?
- I'd love a drink.

01:08:18.805 --> 01:08:21.379
Well, there aren't many days

01:08:21.517 --> 01:08:23.640
And not enough time

01:08:28.564 --> 01:08:30.640
Bedlam is silent

01:08:34.238 --> 01:08:37.523
And the stillness is fury

01:08:41.203 --> 01:08:42.198
Luke?

01:08:45.165 --> 01:08:47.537
Put him on the phone. I'll talk to him.

01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:50.075
- Luke?
- Yeah.

01:08:50.212 --> 01:08:53.379
Hey, Luke. Hey, man, listen to this.

01:08:54.508 --> 01:08:57.343
When I opened my eyes

01:08:57.469 --> 01:08:59.841
A few were gone

01:09:08.397 --> 01:09:12.015
- If I have to go, is this gonna be OK?
- Sure.

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:19.399
I've got too many days to do it
and not enough time

01:09:22.243 --> 01:09:24.283
Fucking shit.

01:09:32.045 --> 01:09:35.580
- Can I use your phone to call my service?
- Sure. Do what you want.

01:09:35.716 --> 01:09:39.215
Just close the door when you leave, OK?

01:09:39.344 --> 01:09:42.014
It's not your fault. You're a pretty lady.

01:09:45.017 --> 01:09:47.055
Fuck off, man!

01:10:03.952 --> 01:10:06.739
Hey, Munson. Open the door, man.

01:10:19.426 --> 01:10:22.712
- Open up!
- Unlock the door, Munson. Let's go.

01:10:22.846 --> 01:10:25.551
- Hey, Munson.
- Come on, man.

01:10:36.735 --> 01:10:39.273
Come on, open up the door, man.

01:10:41.198 --> 01:10:43.237
Come on.

01:10:56.296 --> 01:10:58.419
What the fuck is going on here?

01:11:34.292 --> 01:11:37.496
- He went out, man.
- The man went out.

01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:40.832
Son of a bitch. The man went out.

01:11:40.966 --> 01:11:43.338
Make a hole. Make a hole.

01:11:51.476 --> 01:11:53.516
Did he do himself in?

01:11:56.148 --> 01:11:57.772
What's happening, man?

01:11:57.899 --> 01:12:02.692
Some kid just bought it
by shooting air into his veins.

01:12:06.783 --> 01:12:09.903
Out of here! Out of here! Out! It's all right.

01:12:13.248 --> 01:12:18.206
- Did you see something there?
- Get away. I wanna find out.

01:12:22.758 --> 01:12:25.462
Aw, shit. He's dead, man.

01:12:42.694 --> 01:12:44.272
Vi!

01:12:48.075 --> 01:12:50.114
Vi!

01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:59.294
He didn't even fucking call me.

01:13:01.713 --> 01:13:04.916
Little bastard just wasted his life.

01:13:07.594 --> 01:13:10.429
Well, it's a big fucking relief.

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.008
Man, this nurse calls me
and says he's dead.

01:13:16.144 --> 01:13:18.220
I don't even know her.

01:13:20.482 --> 01:13:23.483
I just gotta get out of here. Let's go out.

01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:27.026
- Just wait a second. I gotta take a shower.
- Yeah. Me too.

01:13:27.155 --> 01:13:30.655
Have some wine or something.
I'll be right back, OK?

01:13:33.703 --> 01:13:37.119
- Don't go away.
- I won't.

01:14:01.565 --> 01:14:04.768

- Huh?

- Did you order some more?

01:15:31.655 --> 01:15:35.948
- We didn't order more champagne.
- Those gentlemen over there did.

01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:47.457
- You're not calling them over?
- They want us to come over.

01:15:47.587 --> 01:15:51.003

Oops.

Hey, Sal. Take off your coat.
You're such a good horse.

01:18:28.498 --> 01:18:32.709

-

01:18:36.297 --> 01:18:41.209
-
- What's this all about?

01:18:41.344 --> 01:18:44.179
This guy seems to be tied up to the fence.

01:18:44.305 --> 01:18:47.223
Mister, I don't know
what your beef is, and I don't care,

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:50.304
but I want you to get this chain
off the fence now.

01:18:50.437 --> 01:18:53.188
Pay attention, motherfucker!

01:18:53.314 --> 01:18:56.399
- We need some entertainment.
- The lady wants some music.

01:18:56.526 --> 01:19:01.022
We need some entertainment.
Sally, come on!

01:19:05.326 --> 01:19:07.652
Yes. Got it!

01:19:10.498 --> 01:19:12.538
Appropriate music.

01:19:14.419 --> 01:19:17.788
Very entertaining.
You guys ever been to a go-go club?

01:19:17.922 --> 01:19:21.422
- Tonight.
- No. That was not a go-go club.

01:19:21.551 --> 01:19:25.335
- What does a real go-go look like?
- I'm gonna show you.

01:19:25.472 --> 01:19:27.511
Show us!

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.680
It's high up here.

01:19:33.521 --> 01:19:35.561
My!

01:19:39.777 --> 01:19:42.351
My! Whoo!

01:19:47.619 --> 01:19:50.489
She's very good. What does she do?

01:19:50.622 --> 01:19:54.038
She's a nutritionist at the VA hospital.

01:19:56.127 --> 01:19:57.752
Ooh.

01:19:57.879 --> 01:20:00.880
I think I see some flesh.

01:20:01.424 --> 01:20:04.793
Take it easy now. Bruce is here.

01:20:17.482 --> 01:20:20.317
Easy does it, Vi. Easy.

01:20:21.402 --> 01:20:23.442
Take it easy.

01:20:27.242 --> 01:20:29.448
You don't have to do that.

01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:38.165
Billy!

01:20:39.587 --> 01:20:44.415
My brother. My brother!

01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:49.342
What happened? What's wrong?

01:20:49.472 --> 01:20:51.714
I think she freaked out.

01:20:53.226 --> 01:20:56.595
Maybe we should have turned on the TV.

01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:59.103
<i>He identified himself as Luke Martin</i>.

01:20:59.232 --> 01:21:02.683
<i>He said he was a sergeant</i>
<i>in the Marines in Vietnam</i>.

01:21:02.819 --> 01:21:06.188
<i>He was arrested after</i>
<i>he chained himself to the west gate</i>.

01:21:06.322 --> 01:21:09.857
<i>He said he wants to stop any others</i>
<i>from going to Vietnam</i>.

01:21:09.993 --> 01:21:14.987
<i>The reason I'm here is because</i>
<i>a buddy of mine who'd been in 'Nam</i>

01:21:15.123 --> 01:21:17.162
<i>took his own life today</i>.

01:21:17.292 --> 01:21:20.043
- <i>This is kind of a funeral service</i>.
- It's Luke!

01:21:20.169 --> 01:21:22.791
<i>I'm here because I'm trying</i>
<i>to tell people, man,</i>

01:21:22.922 --> 01:21:26.872
<i>if we want to commit suicide, we have</i>
<i>plenty of reasons to do it at home</i>.

01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:30.544
<i>We don't have to go to Vietnam</i>
<i>to find reasons to kill ourselves</i>.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:37.217
- <i>I just don't think we should be there</i>.
- <i>Do you think this is a way to stop it?</i>

01:21:37.353 --> 01:21:39.429
<i>I don't know, man</i>.

01:21:39.564 --> 01:21:43.063
<i>The police had difficulty</i>
<i>getting Sgt Martin into the police car</i>

01:21:43.192 --> 01:21:47.689
<i>because he also was chained</i>
<i>to his wheelchair</i>.

01:21:59.667 --> 01:22:01.707
Let me take you home.

01:22:26.903 --> 01:22:29.690
I'm not a very nice person.

01:22:36.913 --> 01:22:38.989
You are to me.

01:22:51.552 --> 01:22:54.921
I wanna spend the night with you.

01:23:13.366 --> 01:23:16.035
- Where's your car?
- Right here.

01:23:37.098 --> 01:23:39.137
Yeah, they're out of the car.

01:23:39.267 --> 01:23:44.641
- Goddamn thing's got a curtain.
- Coming round the side.

01:23:45.982 --> 01:23:48.354
Up to the walk.

01:23:49.527 --> 01:23:53.145
Is she pushing him
or is he going under his own power?

01:23:53.281 --> 01:23:55.320
She's pushing.

01:24:33.154 --> 01:24:38.990
Make yourself comfortable.
I have some things to do in the bathroom.

01:24:40.077 --> 01:24:44.823
- I should be just a few minutes.
- OK.

01:25:20.326 --> 01:25:24.822
Will you pull that sheepskin
toward the centre?

01:25:28.251 --> 01:25:31.370
Pillow. Pillow up against the back.

01:25:35.174 --> 01:25:37.214
Like that?

01:26:13.462 --> 01:26:16.914
Turn the light on. I want to see you.

01:26:28.477 --> 01:26:30.933
What do I do?

01:26:31.063 --> 01:26:35.275
Everything. I want you to do everything.

01:26:35.401 --> 01:26:39.481
Where can I touch you?
Where can you... Where can you feel?

01:26:39.614 --> 01:26:44.774
That's nice. I'm real sensitive,
all the areas that I feel.

01:26:44.911 --> 01:26:47.152
I'm real sensitive there.

01:26:52.752 --> 01:26:57.710
- Can you feel that at all?
- I can't feel it, but I can see it.

01:27:06.515 --> 01:27:10.762
- I wish you could feel me.
- I feel you.

01:27:13.981 --> 01:27:16.021
I want you.

01:27:45.554 --> 01:27:47.594
Oh! Softly.

01:28:10.746 --> 01:28:12.786
Oh!

01:28:32.309 --> 01:28:34.765
You're so beautiful.

01:28:38.024 --> 01:28:41.227
Oh... oh... oh...

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.400
Hey.

01:28:43.529 --> 01:28:45.569
Hey. Shh.

01:28:59.211 --> 01:29:02.082
That's never happened to me before.

01:29:16.103 --> 01:29:19.804
- How much am I paying you?
-

01:29:27.531 --> 01:29:29.571
We gonna paint this?

01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:32.867
We'll paint it to look like steps
so no one knows I'm here.

01:29:32.995 --> 01:29:35.035
Are you ready?

01:29:38.667 --> 01:29:40.909
- OK!
- Yay!

01:29:41.045 --> 01:29:45.873
<i>Living is easy with eyes closed</i>

01:29:46.592 --> 01:29:50.542
<i>Misunderstanding all you see</i>

01:29:51.847 --> 01:29:57.008
<i>It's getting hard to be someone</i>
<i>but it all works out</i>

01:29:57.144 --> 01:30:00.644
<i>It doesn't matter much to me</i>...

01:30:01.232 --> 01:30:04.731
Well, this, strangely enough, is our barber.

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:08.728
For 25 cents you get a massage,
your hair cut and your ears popped.

01:30:08.864 --> 01:30:12.399
Impressive, huh?
The water buffalo didn't like us either.

01:30:12.535 --> 01:30:14.574
There's a tunnel. Look.

01:30:14.703 --> 01:30:19.615
They'd been working on them since Worid
War Two when they fought the Japanese.

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:24.661
Then they fought the French
and built more tunnels and now they got...

01:30:24.797 --> 01:30:30.467
That's a buddy of mine. Willy.
He... he didn't make it.

01:30:31.929 --> 01:30:34.171
Pretty people, huh?

01:30:34.306 --> 01:30:36.382
- That's my smile.
-

01:30:38.269 --> 01:30:43.263
<i>That is, you can't, you know, tune in</i>
<i>but it's all right</i>

01:30:43.399 --> 01:30:47.147
<i>That is, I think it's not too bad</i>

01:30:48.696 --> 01:30:56.241
<i>Let me take you down</i>
<i>cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields</i>...

01:30:56.662 --> 01:31:00.991
- Oh, my God.
- I got a letter from Kathy.

01:31:03.252 --> 01:31:06.039
Something about the newspaper.

01:31:06.172 --> 01:31:09.457
<i>Strawberry Fields forever</i>

01:31:10.759 --> 01:31:14.508
<i>Strawberry Fields forever</i>

01:31:14.638 --> 01:31:17.888
<i>Strawberry Fields forever</i>

01:31:27.234 --> 01:31:29.642
That letter was from Bob.

01:31:34.450 --> 01:31:36.905
- How is he?
- I don't know. I didn't...

01:31:37.036 --> 01:31:41.080
I didn't get a chance to read it.
I guess he's OK.

01:31:44.168 --> 01:31:46.457
Well, whatever he says...

01:31:48.714 --> 01:31:53.542
it's a hundred times worse
than what he can tell you.

01:31:53.677 --> 01:31:55.717
I'm so perverse.

01:31:57.097 --> 01:32:03.717
I'm just jealous because I know when
it's over, he's gonna come back to you.

01:32:31.465 --> 01:32:35.083
We never manage to talk about Bob,
do we?

01:32:35.219 --> 01:32:37.258
No, we don't.

01:32:46.772 --> 01:32:51.517
I don't know what's gonna happen...
with Bob and me, Luke.

01:32:57.616 --> 01:33:03.203
It's very scary for me... to think that
maybe it's not gonna work out with him.

01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:05.370
I know.

01:33:07.209 --> 01:33:10.708
Because we've been together for so long.

01:33:19.888 --> 01:33:22.095
It's gonna be very hard for him,

01:33:22.224 --> 01:33:27.301
and he's not gonna like the fact
that I've... I've changed.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.728
And I <i>have</i> changed.

01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:38.985
You know that I've never
been on my own before?

01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:54.463
<i>Well, baby, when times are bad</i>

01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:59.335
<i>Call on me, darling,</i>
<i>and I'll come to you</i>...

01:34:01.513 --> 01:34:05.593
- You like that, Sid?
- She's got a nice ass for a white girl.

01:34:05.726 --> 01:34:08.810
Should have heard some of the tapes
we made at their pad.

01:34:08.937 --> 01:34:12.852
- Did they get it on?
- I'll give 'em credit for that.

01:34:13.942 --> 01:34:16.612
- Got a good angle?
- Yeah.

01:34:16.737 --> 01:34:21.315
<i>A man and a woman</i>
<i>have each other, baby</i>

01:34:23.994 --> 01:34:28.241
<i>To find their way in this worid</i>

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:36.620
<i>I need you, darling,</i>
<i>like the fish needs the sea</i>...

01:34:36.757 --> 01:34:40.885
Cos everybody's different.
Don't you think so?

01:34:41.011 --> 01:34:45.922
- Oh!
- Hey. It's cool. It's all right.

01:34:46.058 --> 01:34:48.097
Have a nice time.

01:34:48.936 --> 01:34:51.391
Two, please.

01:34:52.398 --> 01:34:56.810
If Dink saw you, he'd probably
think you were a hippie faggot.

01:34:56.944 --> 01:35:00.277
- Here's to Dink, Vi.
- A toast to the host.

01:35:00.406 --> 01:35:04.106
Not here... for a beer.

01:35:05.619 --> 01:35:10.281
If that motherfucker sends me an ear...
Are you listening?

01:35:10.416 --> 01:35:15.208
Are you listening? I just made a poem
and you're not even listening.

01:35:15.337 --> 01:35:18.836
<i>A man and woman</i>
<i>have each other, baby</i>

01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:25.887
<i>To find their way in this worid</i>...

01:35:29.309 --> 01:35:32.513
Bye, guys. See you tomorrow. Bye, Rita.

01:35:41.447 --> 01:35:43.486
Hi.

01:35:45.576 --> 01:35:48.826
It's from Bob. I opened it.

01:35:48.954 --> 01:35:51.527
He's coming home.

01:35:51.665 --> 01:35:54.701
- Is he all right?
- Oh, yeah. He's all right.

01:35:54.835 --> 01:36:00.541
He just got shot in the leg.
Nothing really too heavy. He's all right.

01:36:14.938 --> 01:36:17.394
Will you always be my friend?

01:36:21.904 --> 01:36:23.943
Yes.

01:36:25.073 --> 01:36:27.113
Say "always".

01:36:28.202 --> 01:36:31.701
Always. I'll always be your friend.

01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:36.080
That's very good.

01:36:43.634 --> 01:36:46.041
I'm gonna miss you.

01:37:08.075 --> 01:37:12.155
<i>There's something happening here</i>

01:37:12.287 --> 01:37:15.988
<i>But what it is ain't exactly clear</i>

01:37:17.501 --> 01:37:22.329
<i>There's a man with a gun over there</i>...

01:37:29.763 --> 01:37:31.803
Hello.

01:37:33.559 --> 01:37:35.717
Hold on a second, will you?

01:37:43.277 --> 01:37:46.064
Yeah. This is he.

01:37:50.492 --> 01:37:55.652
Hey, what I have to say to
high-school kids, they're not ready for.

01:37:58.166 --> 01:38:03.125
Yeah. Well, that was televisi贸n.
I was angry. I was upset.

01:38:14.641 --> 01:38:17.476
<i>What a field day for the heat</i>

01:38:18.937 --> 01:38:23.267
<i>A thousand people in the street</i>

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:28.395
<i>Singing songs and carrying signs</i>

01:38:28.530 --> 01:38:32.943
<i>Mostly say: Hooray for our side</i>

01:38:33.076 --> 01:38:36.492
<i>It's time we stop,</i>
<i>hey, what's that sound?</i>

01:38:36.622 --> 01:38:40.240
<i>Everybody look what's going down</i>

01:38:49.301 --> 01:38:52.752
<i>Paranoia strikes deep</i>

01:38:54.181 --> 01:38:57.763
<i>Into your lives it will creep</i>

01:38:58.852 --> 01:39:02.636
<i>It starts when you're always afraid</i>

01:39:03.607 --> 01:39:08.767
<i>You step out of line,</i>
<i>the man come take you away</i>

01:39:08.904 --> 01:39:11.573
<i>We better stop,</i>
<i>hey, what's that sound?</i>

01:39:11.698 --> 01:39:13.738
<i>Everybody look what's going down</i>

01:39:13.867 --> 01:39:16.821
<i>We better stop,</i>
<i>hey, what's that sound</i>...

01:39:18.246 --> 01:39:21.331
What the hell did you do to your hair?

01:39:22.584 --> 01:39:25.122
I've stopped straightening it.

01:39:26.088 --> 01:39:28.127
Where's all the demonstrators?

01:39:28.256 --> 01:39:32.385
Some asshole on the plane said there'd be
a bunch of flower-heads out here.

01:39:32.511 --> 01:39:37.422
There are some kids out there
but they can't come on the base.

01:39:37.557 --> 01:39:40.262
- Does your leg hurt?
- No.

01:39:43.647 --> 01:39:45.723
- What do you think?
- About what?

01:39:45.857 --> 01:39:47.897
Our new car.

01:39:49.277 --> 01:39:51.317
The Speedster?

01:39:53.448 --> 01:39:57.742
It's outstanding. Absolutely outstanding.

01:39:57.869 --> 01:39:59.909
I'm glad you're back.

01:40:02.374 --> 01:40:06.206
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!

01:40:06.336 --> 01:40:10.085
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!

01:40:11.675 --> 01:40:15.589
- Peace, brother.
- Peace on you too, brother.

01:40:17.931 --> 01:40:21.632
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!

01:40:21.893 --> 01:40:24.930
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten...

01:40:26.857 --> 01:40:30.475
You never told me
that you were this close to the beach.

01:40:30.610 --> 01:40:35.652
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You're full of surprises.

01:40:38.368 --> 01:40:42.282
Hey! Welcome back, hero.

01:40:43.248 --> 01:40:45.821
- Vi. How are you?
- Great.

01:40:48.628 --> 01:40:52.128
- So tell me, how's Dink?
- Dink is fine.

01:40:52.257 --> 01:40:56.718
- He's kicking everybody's ass, as always.
- Great.

01:40:58.513 --> 01:41:02.381
No, ladies first,
but I'll have the number two one.

01:41:02.517 --> 01:41:06.597
- Oh, my God. Does this look good.
- Cheers.

01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:08.769
Are you hungry?

01:41:08.899 --> 01:41:13.726
I made some Swedish meatballs
to nibble on. They go great with drinks.

01:41:17.574 --> 01:41:19.614
Do you like it?

01:41:21.828 --> 01:41:23.868
- How's the surf?
- It's good.

01:41:23.997 --> 01:41:26.453
Why don't you sit down, sweetheart?

01:41:26.583 --> 01:41:29.156
So, Bob, tell us about your foot.

01:41:29.294 --> 01:41:32.877
It's not my foot, it's my leg,
and it's a goddamn bore.

01:41:33.006 --> 01:41:36.790
Just like this whole fucking war is boring.

01:41:36.927 --> 01:41:38.966
But, ladies...

01:41:40.764 --> 01:41:44.263
old Bob has gotta tell you
one thing that is not boring,

01:41:44.392 --> 01:41:49.101
and that is the good old US of A martini.

01:41:49.231 --> 01:41:54.308
Of which I am going to partake
as much as I can as quick as I can.

01:41:54.444 --> 01:41:56.769
Drink it up. I made gallons.

01:41:57.864 --> 01:42:00.782
So come on, Bob.
Tell us the story about your leg.

01:42:00.909 --> 01:42:03.482
- What happened?
- There's nothing to tell.

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:07.700
I'm a fucking hero, I'm getting a medal,
and that's the story of my leg!

01:42:07.833 --> 01:42:10.620
- Nothing to it, is there?
- Great.

01:42:10.752 --> 01:42:14.501
- It ain't great.
- How did it happen?

01:42:17.425 --> 01:42:23.131
It's just a boring story. I'm on my way
to the showers. Got an M-16 in one hand...

01:42:23.265 --> 01:42:27.594
- On your way to the showers?
- Yeah. Why not?

01:42:27.727 --> 01:42:32.685
Everywhere you go you carry your M-16,
particularly when you go to the showers!

01:42:32.816 --> 01:42:37.478
There I am, like every other asshole,
trucking on down the road to the showers

01:42:37.612 --> 01:42:43.947
and I tripped
and shot myself right in the calf.

01:42:44.077 --> 01:42:46.615
- Oh, my God.
- And that's it.

01:42:46.746 --> 01:42:50.198
- Dink should've thought of that.
- I didn't think of that!

01:42:50.333 --> 01:42:54.331
- It was a goddamn accident!
- Bob, you don't have to get mad.

01:42:54.462 --> 01:42:59.919
- Yeah, but it was an accident.
- Why are they decorating you?

01:43:01.011 --> 01:43:03.928
- Where's the head?
- Right there.

01:43:07.267 --> 01:43:11.478
I promised a guy from 'Nam I'd have
a drink with him at the Officers Club

01:43:11.605 --> 01:43:13.644
and I gotta go.

01:43:15.025 --> 01:43:17.101
I'll be back for dinner.

01:43:29.039 --> 01:43:31.162
-
- Goddamn!

01:43:31.291 --> 01:43:35.620
You could've aimed better
if you'd had your lights on.

01:43:37.923 --> 01:43:42.252
Man, if you keep your lights on,
you wouldn't need things like that.

01:43:42.385 --> 01:43:46.383
Looks like a fucking
smithereen job to me.

01:43:46.514 --> 01:43:48.673
Yeah, like fucking...

01:43:48.808 --> 01:43:52.224
Not in the front
of the boats. You know?

01:43:52.354 --> 01:43:54.145
The SSS...

01:43:54.272 --> 01:43:56.312
Oh.

01:43:56.441 --> 01:43:58.849
Sally. I'm sorry.

01:43:58.985 --> 01:44:01.025
I'm sorry, darling.

01:44:01.154 --> 01:44:03.194
Hey, don't run out on me, you...

01:44:03.323 --> 01:44:05.362
These are two friends of mine.

01:44:05.492 --> 01:44:08.327
Sally, wait a minute. Sally, Sally.

01:44:08.453 --> 01:44:10.659
My wife, Sally. This is...

01:44:10.789 --> 01:44:12.828
- What was your name?
- Monty.

01:44:14.668 --> 01:44:16.707
- Hey!
-

01:44:16.836 --> 01:44:20.585
I don't know who they are. Who are you?

01:44:20.715 --> 01:44:24.298
-
- This is my wife, Sally.

01:44:24.427 --> 01:44:29.220
Fish. There's two things that smell
like fish. One of them's fish.

01:44:32.519 --> 01:44:35.092
- They laughed, didn't they?
- Go on, already.

01:44:35.230 --> 01:44:41.600
"Avoid loud and aggressive persons.
They are vexatious to the spirit."

01:44:41.736 --> 01:44:43.776
"Keep interested in your own career."

01:44:43.905 --> 01:44:50.987
"However humble, it is a real possessi贸n
in the changing fortunes of time."

01:44:51.121 --> 01:44:55.332
What is that tank for up there?
What's that turtle's name?

01:44:55.458 --> 01:44:57.866
- Let's give him a drink.
- No.

01:44:58.003 --> 01:45:01.087
No, no. Don't put beer in the tank.

01:45:01.214 --> 01:45:07.050
Wait! You'll kill the goddamn...
No! You ain't feeding no turtle.

01:45:08.304 --> 01:45:12.883
You nickel-dick. That's not even a real...
That's a plastic turtle.

01:45:13.018 --> 01:45:17.514
Don't look at that turtle.
I don't want you to look at that turtle.

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:22.224
You hear about the female peanut
walking down the street at night?

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.400
She was assaulted.

01:45:28.116 --> 01:45:33.537
- That's the third time he's told that joke!
- She was a salted and he was insulted!

01:46:08.323 --> 01:46:10.362
Bob?

01:46:11.117 --> 01:46:13.157
Bob.

01:46:22.921 --> 01:46:25.127
- Captain Hyde?
- Yeah.

01:46:25.256 --> 01:46:27.296
The major's ready.

01:46:40.396 --> 01:46:42.603
Major Haller, this is Captain Hyde.

01:46:42.732 --> 01:46:46.979
- Captain Hyde. This is Mr Ott.
- How do you do, sir?

01:46:47.112 --> 01:46:49.519
- Mr Roberts.
- Captain. How are you?

01:46:49.656 --> 01:46:53.985
They're with the FBI.
Would you like to have a seat?

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.946
No, thanks.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:02.454
Well, Captain, what can you tell us
about Luke Martin?

01:47:42.333 --> 01:47:44.373
Aren't you gonna park?

01:47:48.673 --> 01:47:51.923
- What are you gonna do?
- Drive.

01:47:53.928 --> 01:47:56.300
Well... I'll come with you.

01:47:56.431 --> 01:48:00.049
I'd just like to be by myself.

01:48:01.352 --> 01:48:03.392
Please.

01:48:12.614 --> 01:48:14.653
Are you gonna be long?

01:48:16.618 --> 01:48:18.657
No.

01:48:32.258 --> 01:48:39.008
When that gun goes off, you gotta
uncoil like a spring. Just release.

01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:41.180
Swimmers, take your marks.

01:48:41.309 --> 01:48:46.600
You gotta put everything you have
into that moment, right?

01:48:46.731 --> 01:48:52.105
And get as far toward the... I used
to think about the other end of the pool.

01:48:52.237 --> 01:48:54.276
Are you Luke Martin?

01:48:55.365 --> 01:48:58.449
- Depends.
- I'm Bob Hyde.

01:49:02.622 --> 01:49:06.406
Uh... Let's take a little break, Mark, OK?

01:49:15.969 --> 01:49:18.839
I told Sally I was going to do this.

01:49:20.598 --> 01:49:24.382
You have a right to know about
the surveillance. They watched the house.

01:49:24.519 --> 01:49:28.102
They got pictures. They got tapes.

01:49:36.531 --> 01:49:38.570
Thanks for...

01:49:40.368 --> 01:49:42.740
for letting me know.

01:50:05.518 --> 01:50:09.101
That's all I had to say.

01:50:09.230 --> 01:50:12.314
The rest is up to Sally.

01:50:14.152 --> 01:50:16.191
I guess.

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:20.779
See you.

01:50:32.003 --> 01:50:34.042
<i>Now the time has come</i>

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.880
<i>No place to run</i>...

01:50:56.944 --> 01:50:58.771
Hello.

01:51:00.531 --> 01:51:03.236
Luke. What? How am I taking what?

01:51:03.368 --> 01:51:06.203
He didn't tell you?

01:51:06.329 --> 01:51:08.571
I could have sworn that...

01:51:09.957 --> 01:51:14.666
Listen. They had some surveillance on me
because of the gate thing.

01:51:14.796 --> 01:51:16.835
Yeah?

01:51:18.466 --> 01:51:20.505
Oh, my God!

01:51:20.635 --> 01:51:24.300
Listen. I'm gonna be here.
If you need me, call me.

01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:26.719
I'm just here.

01:53:12.538 --> 01:53:15.112
I wanted to talk to you.

01:53:17.376 --> 01:53:21.421
You seem so far away from me
since you came back.

01:53:23.007 --> 01:53:25.463
I just... I've been scared.

01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.180
I love you.

01:53:34.894 --> 01:53:36.933
I do.

01:53:41.317 --> 01:53:46.193
I'm not going to make excuses
for what happened.

01:53:46.322 --> 01:53:49.157
It happened.
I needed somebody. I was lonely.

01:53:49.283 --> 01:53:51.525
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's not...

01:53:51.661 --> 01:53:54.330
- Bob, I was lonely.
- Don't bullshit me.

01:53:54.455 --> 01:53:56.614
- It's not bullshit.
- It's bullshit!

01:53:56.749 --> 01:53:58.789
- Bob, please...
- It's bullshit!

01:53:58.918 --> 01:54:01.539
Everybody needs somebody,
for Christ's sake!

01:54:01.671 --> 01:54:04.340
If it's over with us, it's over!

01:54:05.883 --> 01:54:08.339
You're saying
you won't even make the effort?

01:54:08.469 --> 01:54:13.012
What I'm saying is...
I do not belong in this house!

01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:16.924
- And they say I don't belong over there!
- Who's "they"?

01:54:17.061 --> 01:54:20.430
The people that make the decisions
about the fucking war!

01:54:20.565 --> 01:54:25.025
- Bob, I don't wanna talk about the war.
- What, then? The fucking marriage?

01:54:25.152 --> 01:54:26.611
Think about that.

01:54:26.737 --> 01:54:29.359
I can't talk to you
when you're shouting at me.

01:54:29.490 --> 01:54:34.864
I wanna be your husband.
I just don't deserve to be your husband.

01:54:36.163 --> 01:54:38.833
I don't deserve the fucking medal either.

01:54:38.958 --> 01:54:42.576
How can they give you a medal for a war
they don't even want you to fight?

01:54:42.712 --> 01:54:44.953
- Who is that?
- Bob? Sally? Can I talk to you?

01:54:45.089 --> 01:54:51.459
- It's Luke. Let me tell him to go away.
- Wait a minute. You just wait right there.

01:55:10.281 --> 01:55:14.610
I don't wanna make anything
more complicated than it already is.

01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:21.957
I just thought there might be a few things
that... we should talk about.

01:55:22.084 --> 01:55:25.785
Well, they're not very complicated.

01:55:25.922 --> 01:55:28.294
It's actually very simple.

01:55:34.055 --> 01:55:38.004
- I don't belong here.
- You belong here.

01:55:39.268 --> 01:55:44.310
I just wanted to get things straight,
what's going on with me,

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:47.109
so you know where I'm coming from
and what happened.

01:55:47.234 --> 01:55:50.070
I know where you're coming from.

01:55:51.697 --> 01:55:53.856
And I know what happened.

01:55:55.826 --> 01:56:00.038
I've just gotta figure out for myself

01:56:01.207 --> 01:56:04.825
what happened
and how I'm gonna deal with it.

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:07.000
- I can understand that.
- Bullshit!

01:56:07.129 --> 01:56:09.169
- Don't.
- You jodie fuck!

01:56:09.298 --> 01:56:12.085
You get back! Get back, slope cunt!

01:56:15.805 --> 01:56:21.890
Now you, jodie motherfucker, explain
to me how it is you understand anything.

01:56:22.019 --> 01:56:26.811
I understand because I'm a brother and
I've been in the same place you're at now.

01:56:26.941 --> 01:56:30.357
That's why I feel bad that I made it
harder for you than it already is.

01:56:30.486 --> 01:56:32.526
That's bullshit.

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:37.940
She's here because she loves you.
There was never any question of that.

01:56:38.077 --> 01:56:41.528
- Don't tell me that, goddamnit!
- It's true, Bob.

01:56:41.664 --> 01:56:44.581
Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:48.208
If you give her a chance,
she can help you.

01:56:50.256 --> 01:56:54.384
She wants to listen to you
and she wants to understand you.

01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:56.835
Say something else, fuck.

01:56:59.306 --> 01:57:02.058
Say something else, fuck.

01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:09.763
I'm not the enemy.

01:57:11.861 --> 01:57:15.645
Maybe the enemy is the fucking war.

01:57:17.908 --> 01:57:24.278
But you don't want to kill anybody here.
You have enough ghosts to carry around.

01:57:36.844 --> 01:57:39.300
Look at me. I'm...

01:57:41.348 --> 01:57:43.388
My hand.

01:57:49.273 --> 01:57:51.313
I was shaking.

01:57:53.569 --> 01:57:55.609
I'm sorry.

01:57:58.991 --> 01:58:01.067
I'm fucked.

01:58:33.484 --> 01:58:37.861
I just wanna be a hero. That's all.

01:58:40.866 --> 01:58:43.488
I just wanna be a fucking hero.

01:58:45.037 --> 01:58:50.376
One day in my life, one moment,
I wanna go out a hero.

01:58:52.545 --> 01:58:58.998
That way I would have done something
that was mine, that I've done.

01:59:34.128 --> 01:59:36.879
Enemy forces had captured
the north side of the bridge

01:59:37.006 --> 01:59:40.505
when Lieutenant Roscoe
charged forward firing his rifle.

01:59:40.634 --> 01:59:44.502
Lieutenant Roscoe's actions
so unnerved the enemy, they withdrew,

01:59:44.638 --> 01:59:47.556
allowing the lieutenant
to secure the enemy position

01:59:47.683 --> 01:59:51.811
until the rest of his company could move
forward and consolidate their forces.

01:59:51.937 --> 01:59:55.721
Lieutenant Roscoe maintained
the position against repeated attacks

01:59:55.858 --> 01:59:58.479
and, though wounded,
continued to inspire his men

01:59:58.611 --> 02:00:01.280
until reinforcements arrived
the following day.

02:00:01.405 --> 02:00:05.533
Lieutenant Roscoe has upheld the highest
traditions of the Marine Corps

02:00:05.659 --> 02:00:08.067
and of the United States naval service.

02:00:08.203 --> 02:00:14.456
The Marine Corps builds body,
mind and spirit. Thank you.

02:00:18.964 --> 02:00:22.832
And now, with a different perspective,
we have Luke Martin,

02:00:22.968 --> 02:00:26.053
combat veteran of the Marine Corps.

02:00:44.239 --> 02:00:48.451
- Sergeant, mind if I ask you a question?
- No, sir.

02:00:49.662 --> 02:00:53.161
Just call me Sergeant - that's what I was.

02:00:54.249 --> 02:00:56.408
- Where were you stationed?
- Da Nang.

02:01:05.719 --> 02:01:09.634
I thought I'd go get some steaks
for a barbecue. Would you like that?

02:01:11.642 --> 02:01:15.426
It's been a long time
since you've lit a barbecue.

02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:19.018
The charcoal's under the kitchen sink.

02:01:19.149 --> 02:01:23.811
I'm gonna see if Vi
wants to come with me. See you later.

02:01:40.504 --> 02:01:45.462
You want to be a part of it
and patriotic and go out and...

02:01:45.592 --> 02:01:48.593
get your licks in for the US of A.

02:01:51.432 --> 02:01:57.636
And when you get over there,
it's a totally different situation.

02:01:59.231 --> 02:02:01.271
I mean...

02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:06.063
you grow up real quick

02:02:06.196 --> 02:02:10.064
because all you're seeing is a lot of death.

02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:32.638
<i>Once I was a soldier</i>

02:02:34.558 --> 02:02:39.434
<i>And I fought on foreign sands for you</i>

02:02:40.856 --> 02:02:44.557
<i>Once I was a hunter</i>...

02:02:46.403 --> 02:02:49.155
And I know some of you
are gonna look at that uniform

02:02:49.281 --> 02:02:54.738
and you're gonna remember all the films
and think about the glory of other wars

02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:57.443
and think about some vague...

02:02:59.708 --> 02:03:02.116
patriotic feeling

02:03:02.252 --> 02:03:05.752
and go off and fight this turkey too.

02:03:05.881 --> 02:03:09.250
<i>Soon there'll be another</i>

02:03:11.595 --> 02:03:16.340
<i>To tell you I was just a lie</i>

02:03:17.601 --> 02:03:24.398
<i>And sometimes I wonder</i>

02:03:24.525 --> 02:03:29.519
<i>Just for a while</i>

02:03:29.655 --> 02:03:32.490
<i>Will you ever</i>...

02:03:32.616 --> 02:03:36.863
I'm telling you it ain't like it is
in the movies. I didn't have a choice.

02:03:36.995 --> 02:03:41.741
When I was your age, all I got was
some guy standing up like that man

02:03:41.875 --> 02:03:43.951
and giving me bullshit, which I caught.

02:03:44.086 --> 02:03:47.585
I was really in good shape then.
I was captain of the football team.

02:03:47.714 --> 02:03:52.756
I wanted to be a war hero, man.
I wanted to go out and kill for my country.

02:03:53.804 --> 02:03:57.884
<i>Once I was a lover</i>

02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:04.519
<i>And I searched behind your eyes for you</i>

02:04:06.191 --> 02:04:10.236
<i>And soon there'll be another</i>...

02:04:10.362 --> 02:04:16.566
And now I'm here to tell you that
I have killed for my country or whatever

02:04:16.702 --> 02:04:19.240
and I don't feel good about it.

02:04:23.208 --> 02:04:26.909
Because there's not
enough reason, man...

02:04:33.427 --> 02:04:39.845
to feel a person die in your hands
or to see your best buddy get blown away.

02:04:44.062 --> 02:04:47.763
I'm here to tell you it's a lousy thing, man.

02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:50.355
I don't see any reason for it.

02:04:54.323 --> 02:04:58.237
And there's a lot of shit
that I did over there

02:04:58.368 --> 02:05:01.572
that I find fucking hard to live with.

02:05:01.705 --> 02:05:04.196
And I don't wanna see
people like you coming back

02:05:04.333 --> 02:05:08.377
and having to face the rest of your lives
with that shit. It's as simple as that.

02:05:08.503 --> 02:05:14.708
I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm a lot
fucking smarter now than when I went.

02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:19.045
And I'm just telling you...

02:05:21.183 --> 02:05:24.137
that there's a choice to be made here.

02:05:25.604 --> 02:05:32.852
<i>Will you ever remember me?</i>

02:05:37.366 --> 02:05:40.153
<i>Ever</i>

02:05:41.245 --> 02:05:46.619
<i>Remember me?</i>

02:06:13.402 --> 02:06:16.984
<i>You don't know what's going on</i>

02:06:17.114 --> 02:06:21.028
<i>You've been away for far too long</i>

02:06:21.159 --> 02:06:26.071
<i>You can't come back</i>
<i>and think you are still mine</i>

02:06:27.374 --> 02:06:30.909
<i>You're out of touch, my baby</i>

02:06:31.044 --> 02:06:34.828
<i>My poor discarded baby</i>

02:06:34.965 --> 02:06:40.884
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

02:06:42.556 --> 02:06:49.602
<i>Well, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

02:06:49.730 --> 02:06:56.266
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

02:06:56.695 --> 02:06:59.400
<i>You are all left out</i>

02:07:02.409 --> 02:07:05.078
<i>Out of there without a doubt</i>

02:07:05.203 --> 02:07:10.364
<i>Cos baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

02:07:13.962 --> 02:07:17.711
<i>A girl who wants to run away</i>

02:07:17.841 --> 02:07:21.590
<i>Discovers that she's had her day</i>

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:25.883
<i>It's no good you thinking</i>
<i>that you are still mine</i>

02:07:28.143 --> 02:07:31.594
<i>You're out of touch, my baby</i>

02:07:31.730 --> 02:07:35.348
<i>My poor unfaithful baby</i>

02:07:35.484 --> 02:07:40.644
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>...
