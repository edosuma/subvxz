01:28.435 --> 01:30.444
Sadie, come on.

04:35.250 --> 04:39.615
Being this day, year
of our Lord 1691,

04:40.122 --> 04:41.737
Colony of Massachusetts,

04:41.757 --> 04:43.403
Township of Boston,

04:43.759 --> 04:45.761
and such like, and such like.

04:47.379 --> 04:49.031
There is a minister,

04:49.238 --> 04:51.173
one who will come.

04:53.907 --> 04:57.391
Confession may better your
chances in the hereafter.

04:58.001 --> 04:59.438
It is doubtful,

04:59.626 --> 05:01.778
but it may, by some
twist of fate.

05:01.798 --> 05:03.894
A wealth of evidence
has convicted thee

05:03.914 --> 05:05.810
of trafficking with the devil.

05:06.421 --> 05:08.168
Thou art to be hanged...

05:08.785 --> 05:13.269
And then burned over a
basket of living cats.

05:13.289 --> 05:15.791
There is no question
left but one.

05:17.293 --> 05:19.914
Do you choose to
admit your crimes

05:19.934 --> 05:21.817
before man and God?

05:26.855 --> 05:29.305
You'll get nothing from him.
'Tis as I said.

05:30.807 --> 05:32.790
That's the whole of it, then.

05:32.810 --> 05:36.313
Let the record show that
this obscene wretch,

05:36.333 --> 05:38.295
though afforded opportunity,

05:38.315 --> 05:41.253
did fail to confess his crimes.

05:41.513 --> 05:44.802
Sentence shall be carried
out in timely fashion.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.323
We stand adjourned.

06:04.593 --> 06:06.575
Terrified, were they not?

06:06.595 --> 06:10.078
Bold words for a man
but hours from death.

06:10.098 --> 06:13.582
Much can happen in a day.

06:13.602 --> 06:16.104
Yet here have you hung for 3.

06:18.671 --> 06:22.743
Would not Satan have saved
you were he thus inclined?

06:23.015 --> 06:25.926
Perhaps he'll save
us both, Redferne.

06:31.604 --> 06:33.235
I've tracked you my last.

06:33.255 --> 06:34.737
Tomorrow shall you die.

06:34.757 --> 06:37.259
Never was there a
brute more deserving.

06:38.761 --> 06:41.244
Believe it upon seeing it.

06:41.264 --> 06:42.765
Tomorrow.

06:43.266 --> 06:44.767
Tomorrow.

06:56.279 --> 06:58.261
The thumb locks, they
shall be kept in place

06:58.281 --> 07:01.264
even after he is hanged,
even while he burns.

07:01.284 --> 07:02.765
When there is naught but ash,

07:02.785 --> 07:04.787
only then should they be...

07:09.293 --> 07:11.775
Only then can they be dug free

07:11.795 --> 07:13.296
and returned to me.

07:50.084 --> 07:52.086
My dear God!

08:43.590 --> 08:46.092
...downed power lines
and blown-out windows.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.576
Another report claims a tornado
touched down in the Malibu area,

08:49.596 --> 08:51.077
but that's, as yet, unconfirmed.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.580
What is certain is that
this Santa Ana condition,

08:53.600 --> 08:54.582
unpredicted by forecasters,

08:54.602 --> 08:56.583
is quickly living
up to its namesake

08:56.603 --> 08:58.084
of the Devil's Wind.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.105
Now back...

09:40.281 --> 09:41.282
Was that you?

09:58.300 --> 09:59.282
He's breathing.

09:59.302 --> 10:01.303
Watch out for the glass.

10:01.803 --> 10:04.305
It's a wonder he didn't
cut himself worse.

10:06.308 --> 10:08.290
Canyon Country.

10:08.310 --> 10:09.311
Gets 'em all.

10:10.812 --> 10:12.795
Think he's just drunk?

10:12.815 --> 10:15.798
Hate to think he does
this kind of thing sober.

10:15.818 --> 10:19.302
So what the heck are these?

10:19.322 --> 10:20.323
Hey, don't touch him.

10:20.823 --> 10:22.825
Let the cops do that stuff.

10:23.326 --> 10:25.308
Yeah.

10:25.328 --> 10:26.329
Right.

10:36.339 --> 10:38.207
Oh, the winds.

10:40.209 --> 10:42.692
Well, come on.

10:42.712 --> 10:44.194
Let's get him up.

10:44.214 --> 10:45.696
Yeah, let's stick
him on the porch.

10:45.716 --> 10:48.198
A little compassion
wouldn't hurt, Kassandra.

10:48.218 --> 10:49.200
Or some smarts, Chas.

10:49.220 --> 10:51.721
You just can't take in
every stray that you meet.

10:52.222 --> 10:54.224
I took you in, didn't I?

11:02.366 --> 11:04.348
No, no, no. Not the sofa.

11:04.368 --> 11:06.370
It's over a hundred years old.

11:07.871 --> 11:08.852
Where?

11:08.872 --> 11:10.354
Your room.

11:10.374 --> 11:11.355
Mine?

11:11.375 --> 11:13.377
Everything's plastic.

11:52.418 --> 11:53.899
Miraculous recovery you made.

11:53.919 --> 11:57.903
Let me make a suggestion...
lose the booze, huh?

11:57.923 --> 12:00.156
Phones are workin'.

12:00.176 --> 12:02.525
Got someone you can call?

12:02.545 --> 12:05.778
Could this somehow be the year?

12:05.798 --> 12:07.780
Hey, Chas, he talks english.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.301
English english.

12:11.937 --> 12:14.420
3 centuries.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.692
Oh, brother.

12:16.809 --> 12:19.292
Look, just lie down here.

12:19.312 --> 12:23.816
Let your big, gray
Delco recharge.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.251
Jeez!

12:57.652 --> 12:59.133
Oof.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.156
Don't ever let me get old.

13:23.929 --> 13:26.932
Jeez Louise, you scared me.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.928
I'm headin' out in
a little while.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.316
I'll give you a lift downtown.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.961
What are you looking at?

13:57.964 --> 13:59.465
Oh, my ring.

13:59.582 --> 14:01.564
I'm a Scorpio.

14:01.584 --> 14:03.586
Or I was.

14:04.087 --> 14:07.070
I don't believe in
astrology much anymore.

14:07.090 --> 14:09.072
Truly?

14:09.092 --> 14:10.593
I don't think anyone does.

14:11.094 --> 14:14.097
I mean, it's just so Sixties.

14:15.598 --> 14:17.580
You hungry?

14:17.600 --> 14:19.602
I got plenty of extras.

14:21.604 --> 14:24.088
Look... I'd let you try it on,

14:24.108 --> 14:26.090
but, see, I broke
this little finger,

14:26.110 --> 14:27.591
and now it's pretty much...

14:27.611 --> 14:28.111
stuck.

14:29.613 --> 14:33.097
Did I hear Kassandra say
something about England?

14:33.117 --> 14:34.349
I was over there in '86.

14:34.369 --> 14:37.351
I did this package thing
with, like, some friends.

14:37.371 --> 14:40.374
We included England, Scotland...

14:51.518 --> 14:53.500
Help!

14:53.520 --> 14:54.638
Help!

14:56.141 --> 14:57.622
Help!

14:57.642 --> 14:59.124
Somebody!

14:59.144 --> 15:00.645
Please!

15:02.030 --> 15:04.032
Help!

15:07.035 --> 15:08.633
Help!

15:08.653 --> 15:10.154
No.

15:12.157 --> 15:13.638
Please.

15:13.658 --> 15:14.659
No!

15:49.695 --> 15:52.178
Private clubs, ads.

15:52.198 --> 15:56.202
Really, he's just a guy
I rented a room from.

15:56.703 --> 15:58.819
If he was coming, I
was always going.

15:58.839 --> 16:00.590
Did he frequent public parks?

16:01.091 --> 16:03.573
He didn't dick little boys
through bathroom walls.

16:03.593 --> 16:04.942
You said your roommate was gay.

16:04.962 --> 16:08.328
Not queer. Big difference.

16:08.348 --> 16:10.350
Can you give me the
names of his lovers?

16:14.354 --> 16:16.356
Coroner's notes...

16:16.857 --> 16:19.339
"Victim was found with
tongue severed from mouth

16:19.359 --> 16:21.842
"in such a manner as to
suggest it was bitten out.

16:21.862 --> 16:24.344
Bite marks on the back of the neck.
Evidence of..."

16:24.364 --> 16:27.849
you about done?
I forgot my insulin.

16:27.869 --> 16:29.967
We'd like to find this guy

16:29.987 --> 16:31.989
before he makes an omelet out
of somebody else's tongue.

16:39.580 --> 16:40.561
I'll see you!

16:40.581 --> 16:42.063
Thank you.

16:42.083 --> 16:45.066
Don't thank me, thank Treshar.

16:45.086 --> 16:46.587
Bye-bye.

16:47.588 --> 16:48.569
Bye-bye.

16:48.589 --> 16:49.590
Bye, Fern.

17:03.489 --> 17:04.990
You are a spiritualist?

17:06.742 --> 17:09.724
I'm sorry.
I thought everybody left.

17:09.744 --> 17:12.114
You hail spirits, do you not?

17:13.365 --> 17:15.347
I channel them.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.368
Were you at the session?

17:22.007 --> 17:24.490
Then channel me a spirit.

17:24.510 --> 17:29.631
Well, I really only do
grope... group sessions.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.634
Group sessions.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.253
Channel me a spirit.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.622
Who did you have in mind?

17:39.642 --> 17:42.125
Like a relative?

17:42.145 --> 17:44.627
Like a father.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.129
What's his name?

17:46.149 --> 17:47.150
He has many.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.767
I'll need one.

17:50.787 --> 17:51.904
Zamiel.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.542
Zamiel.

18:12.426 --> 18:16.911
I have come...

18:16.931 --> 18:19.413
Zamiel.

18:19.433 --> 18:25.553
Ask me what you will.

18:25.573 --> 18:28.055
I would ask that we wait.

18:28.075 --> 18:31.559
For what do we wait?

18:31.579 --> 18:34.583
For the true Zamiel to appear.

18:37.085 --> 18:39.568
I am Zamiel...

18:39.588 --> 18:43.572
And only when you
have cast aside

18:43.592 --> 18:48.076
all doubts will you be able

18:48.096 --> 18:51.599
to ask... me...

18:55.720 --> 18:58.723
Able to... to...

19:03.228 --> 19:06.212
To... ask...

19:06.232 --> 19:08.714
ask me...

19:08.734 --> 19:09.735
ask...

19:21.881 --> 19:27.233
Ask me what thou will.

19:27.253 --> 19:30.236
How comes it that you
have brought me here?

19:30.256 --> 19:35.375
Bring together that
which has been thirded.

19:35.395 --> 19:40.380
Bring together my bible.

19:40.400 --> 19:45.385
The Grand Grimoire? Here? Now?

19:45.405 --> 19:48.889
By a resourceful witch,

19:48.909 --> 19:52.913
it could be retaken.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.762
My efforts...

19:55.782 --> 19:57.764
How might they be rewarded?

19:57.784 --> 20:01.170
Service to Satan is reward!

20:01.672 --> 20:03.270
For others surely,

20:03.290 --> 20:07.795
but for that most cunning witch
who steals back your bible,

20:08.296 --> 20:10.778
the book that can
thwart creation itself,

20:10.798 --> 20:12.299
what for him?

20:15.186 --> 20:17.669
Do what I demand.

20:17.689 --> 20:21.172
Bring together all 3 parts,

20:21.192 --> 20:24.676
and you shall be him.

20:24.696 --> 20:26.678
Him?

20:26.698 --> 20:31.703
The one begotten son.

20:32.070 --> 20:34.552
It shall be me.

20:34.572 --> 20:39.828
Let mine eyes guide thee.

23:06.145 --> 23:07.146
Did he bleed?

23:07.647 --> 23:09.148
The one who wore these,
did he bleed whatsoe'er.

23:14.655 --> 23:16.657
No. No.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.291
Stop.

23:20.294 --> 23:22.546
Get off.

23:24.047 --> 23:25.048
He was here.

23:25.549 --> 23:27.030
His signature I know.

23:27.050 --> 23:30.053
But I can find the beast
only if his blood was spilt.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.682
He came through this
window, did he not?

23:42.182 --> 23:43.183
Landing here.

23:44.184 --> 23:45.667
The blond-haired guy?

23:45.687 --> 23:46.801
Him?

23:46.821 --> 23:47.822
Was he cut?

23:50.825 --> 23:52.827
Show me where.

24:15.850 --> 24:17.853
This may do.

24:41.627 --> 24:43.108
Police emergency.

24:43.128 --> 24:46.111
Yeah. Some guy's in
the house with me.

24:46.131 --> 24:48.114
I don't know how
dangerous he is,

24:48.134 --> 24:50.116
but he's got a thing for blood.

24:50.136 --> 24:52.118
You know.
Draw your own conclusions.

24:52.138 --> 24:54.120
I've got your address
on the screen.

24:54.140 --> 24:55.121
3237 Woodburn.

24:55.141 --> 24:56.623
Can I have your name?

24:56.643 --> 24:58.124
Kassandra with a "K."

24:58.144 --> 25:00.126
We'll have a car there
in a few minutes.

25:00.146 --> 25:02.128
Don't expect me to be
waiting around for you

25:02.148 --> 25:04.150
'cause I'm skating right now.

25:05.652 --> 25:07.654
Your well, where would it be?

25:08.021 --> 25:09.502
My whale?

25:09.522 --> 25:11.004
Your well... the place
you draw water.

25:11.024 --> 25:12.525
Oh, sure.

25:13.526 --> 25:15.027
My well.

25:46.394 --> 25:49.898
Now, brute, one last time
will we play the game out.

25:53.402 --> 25:55.384
What is it?

25:55.404 --> 25:57.270
Please, do not even
breathe on it.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.770
Some kind of compass?

25:58.790 --> 26:00.272
Witch compass.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.773
This one here?

26:01.793 --> 26:02.794
What of it?

26:03.295 --> 26:04.276
What is it?

26:04.296 --> 26:06.278
As I say, 'tis a witch compass.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.279
Ohh.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.781
You mean witch...

26:09.801 --> 26:11.283
Not which.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.785
Like Samantha, Tabitha witch.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.306
Like the warlock.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.312
Th-that guy was a warlock?

26:20.812 --> 26:22.815
The rudest that ever
troubled daylight.

26:24.317 --> 26:26.819
And this little jobber's
going to find him, right?

26:27.820 --> 26:30.303
The needle shall point
up his direction.

26:30.323 --> 26:32.325
The quicker it swings,
the closer is he.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.326
The slower, the more distant.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.829
Way cool.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.712
What a cup of shit.

26:53.213 --> 26:54.695
This isn't gonna work.

26:54.715 --> 26:55.696
Give it time.

26:55.716 --> 26:57.718
The blood was thin.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.221
Time's something you
ain't got, Buddy.

27:16.620 --> 27:19.103
Though first I did think
this was Newcastle

27:19.123 --> 27:21.105
or a township of the Carolinas,

27:21.125 --> 27:23.608
I think I'm farther removed.

27:23.628 --> 27:24.629
Much farther.

27:30.251 --> 27:32.233
Hey, somebody's coming out.

27:32.253 --> 27:34.235
Freeze, police!

27:34.255 --> 27:35.737
Watch his hands.

27:35.757 --> 27:37.258
Watch it!

27:44.015 --> 27:45.516
He lays waste to
all in his path.

27:46.017 --> 27:48.500
The place matters not.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.021
Hear me when I say he's evil.

27:50.522 --> 27:51.503
Evil absolute.

27:51.523 --> 27:53.525
We'll run him down
to the station,

27:53.658 --> 27:54.640
but in the meantime,
here's some advice.

27:54.660 --> 27:56.142
Get away from this house.

27:56.162 --> 27:57.510
You got a watch?

27:57.530 --> 27:58.511
Yeah.

27:58.531 --> 27:59.532
Time me.

29:37.799 --> 29:40.282
You've reached 911
police emergency.

29:40.302 --> 29:41.284
Please stand by.

29:41.304 --> 29:43.285
Your call will be handled

29:43.305 --> 29:45.190
as soon as an operator
becomes available.

29:47.309 --> 29:48.310
Ohh!

31:03.021 --> 31:06.004
Tout, tout, through and about,

31:06.024 --> 31:08.006
your callow life in dismay.

31:08.026 --> 31:12.010
Rentum oscillum tormentum.

31:12.030 --> 31:14.782
A decade twice over a day.

32:01.781 --> 32:04.263
This guy put some kind of
hoodoo hex spell on me.

32:04.283 --> 32:06.286
He made me 40 instead of 20.

32:07.287 --> 32:08.769
Is that what this guy did?

32:08.789 --> 32:10.791
There's no crime of
which he's incapable.

32:15.429 --> 32:17.911
Hey, hey, uh... ahem.

32:17.931 --> 32:19.933
Other door, ok?

32:20.050 --> 32:21.051
Other door.

32:30.193 --> 32:32.195
Not a local product, are you?

32:36.317 --> 32:37.318
Too late!

32:37.819 --> 32:38.820
The evil one is back!

32:40.321 --> 32:42.303
It's too late!

32:42.323 --> 32:45.576
16 hundred and 91?

32:45.827 --> 32:46.327
Aye.

32:46.828 --> 32:49.310
Like almost 300 years ago?

32:49.330 --> 32:52.333
As queer it seems to you,
'tis even more so to me.

32:57.338 --> 32:58.839
He did this?

32:59.340 --> 33:02.323
20 fuckin' years,
and not one party.

33:02.343 --> 33:03.844
What a total ass-burn.

33:04.345 --> 33:06.828
The altar table, he broked it?

33:06.848 --> 33:08.330
Yeah, he broked it.

33:08.350 --> 33:09.734
Hey, look, I didn't spring you

33:10.235 --> 33:11.834
so you could come fix furniture.

33:11.854 --> 33:13.238
What about me?
How do we fix my face?

33:13.739 --> 33:14.721
What was it he took from you?

33:14.741 --> 33:16.742
20 years.

33:16.859 --> 33:17.840
An object.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.341
What kind of object?

33:19.361 --> 33:22.364
Something small.
Something personal to you.

33:22.748 --> 33:23.729
My bracelet.

33:23.749 --> 33:24.730
Like that?

33:24.750 --> 33:26.251
He took my charm bracelet.

33:26.368 --> 33:27.369
Then you must reclaim it.

33:28.871 --> 33:30.873
Only then can the
spell be countered.

33:31.874 --> 33:33.355
Reclaim it?

33:33.375 --> 33:36.358
This I spied earlier.

33:36.378 --> 33:38.380
'Tis yours? The whole of it?

33:39.382 --> 33:40.383
Just salt.

33:40.884 --> 33:41.885
We'll take your coach.

33:42.886 --> 33:44.888
We'll take a minute here.

33:49.392 --> 33:51.374
Do you mean I gotta
get my bracelet back

33:51.394 --> 33:52.876
to break the spell?

33:52.896 --> 33:53.897
Back from that warlock...

33:54.397 --> 33:55.879
the guy who finger-paints
with body fluids?

33:55.899 --> 33:57.380
'Tis the one way.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.882
This you must do.

33:58.902 --> 34:00.884
There is no question of it.

34:00.904 --> 34:02.019
You see this? Insulin.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.520
It's the one thing I must do.

34:03.540 --> 34:06.159
I hate it 'cause
I have to do it!

34:08.043 --> 34:09.545
I'll just cut and
dye my hair again.

34:10.047 --> 34:13.030
Hey, 40 ain't so bad.

34:13.050 --> 34:14.282
I'll buy a little tennis skirt

34:14.302 --> 34:15.783
and prance around town

34:15.803 --> 34:17.304
like those bitches
in their BMWs.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.286
Sorry, Redferne,

34:20.306 --> 34:22.290
but if you're nuts enough
to wanna find this guy,

34:22.310 --> 34:23.791
you're on your own.

34:23.811 --> 34:26.313
You realize not.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.295
Realize?

34:29.315 --> 34:30.297
What?

34:30.317 --> 34:32.299
What the spell has done.

34:32.319 --> 34:34.301
It's aged me 20 years.

34:34.321 --> 34:35.803
Not aged.

34:35.822 --> 34:36.824
Aging.

34:38.826 --> 34:40.306
Are you saying that tomorrow

34:40.327 --> 34:43.311
I'm gonna wake up...60?

34:43.331 --> 34:44.813
I say this.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.815
Unless you find the warlock
and thereby your bracelet,

34:47.835 --> 34:49.337
you shall die in
but half a week.

34:50.839 --> 34:51.820
Die?

34:51.840 --> 34:52.841
Of old age.

35:03.468 --> 35:04.950
That didn't help.

35:04.970 --> 35:05.971
Let's tarry not.

35:08.473 --> 35:10.975
Hey, let's get things straight.

35:11.977 --> 35:13.980
All I want is the bracelet.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.463
I don't give a sailing
shit what he did to you.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.348
Look...

35:19.368 --> 35:21.870
Soon as I'm 20 again,
you are on your own,

35:22.371 --> 35:23.372
got that, Bud?

36:06.917 --> 36:09.536
Look, if you're hungry,
we'll just stop.

36:14.926 --> 36:17.929
Ok, what are you doing?

36:19.430 --> 36:20.912
Salting the leather.

36:20.932 --> 36:22.433
No kidding.

36:23.935 --> 36:25.416
How come?

36:25.436 --> 36:27.919
Witches loathe salt.

36:27.939 --> 36:30.421
Don't blame 'em.
Salt, sugar, sulfites.

36:30.441 --> 36:32.443
All that shit will kill you.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.181
Tell me...

36:40.201 --> 36:42.203
Must we travel on just
one side of the roadway,

36:42.704 --> 36:44.205
or is it whichever we choose?

36:44.455 --> 36:45.938
Yeah. It's just one side.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.940
Which side might that be?

36:47.960 --> 36:49.461
The right side.

36:51.463 --> 36:53.312
Let your attention
lie before you,

36:53.332 --> 36:54.833
not beside you.

36:55.334 --> 36:57.816
Check this.
Some guy from the 17th century

36:57.836 --> 36:59.838
teaching me how to drive.

37:00.839 --> 37:02.340
How quick they learn.

37:06.345 --> 37:08.327
He's gotta go deep.

37:08.347 --> 37:10.329
He's gotta go deep.

37:10.349 --> 37:12.831
He needs 10 yards. It's fourth.

37:12.851 --> 37:14.333
It's fourth and 10.

37:14.353 --> 37:15.834
He's going!

37:15.854 --> 37:17.337
He hikes the ball,

37:17.357 --> 37:18.338
throws it.

37:18.358 --> 37:19.839
Good!

37:19.859 --> 37:21.341
Gets it again.

37:21.361 --> 37:23.343
Gets it again. Makes a pass!

37:23.363 --> 37:24.364
Throws it up.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.484
When you pass,

37:31.504 --> 37:33.486
you can't let those
little stick guys

37:33.506 --> 37:34.988
get between you
and the receiver,

37:35.008 --> 37:36.509
or else they'll keep
intercepting, ok?

37:37.510 --> 37:38.858
Yeah! 6 points!

37:38.878 --> 37:41.380
Now I kick off to you.

37:45.385 --> 37:47.500
You can't punt on first down.

37:47.520 --> 37:50.023
Nobody does that,
not even Tampa Bay.

37:51.776 --> 37:54.258
Don't you watch football?

37:54.278 --> 37:56.260
Whence comes it?

37:56.280 --> 37:57.397
Huh?

37:57.898 --> 37:58.879
The music.

37:58.899 --> 38:01.401
Oh, there's a church over there.

38:04.155 --> 38:05.656
And how is it you're not there?

38:06.157 --> 38:07.158
Oh, I never go.

38:07.658 --> 38:09.140
My dad hates all that stuff

38:09.160 --> 38:10.661
about Jesus and the
12 apostrophes.

38:11.545 --> 38:12.527
Aw! Intercepted.

38:12.547 --> 38:14.548
Your turn.

38:15.549 --> 38:17.531
How come you're not there?

38:17.551 --> 38:18.532
Church?

38:18.552 --> 38:20.035
Yeah. It's Sunday.

38:20.055 --> 38:23.038
No witch can set foot
on church ground.

38:23.058 --> 38:25.040
Ha. You're telling
me you're a witch?

38:25.060 --> 38:27.042
You ain't no witch.
Witches are girls.

38:27.062 --> 38:29.044
Some are men.

38:29.064 --> 38:32.047
Yeah?
So where's your broomstick?

38:32.067 --> 38:34.049
Witches fly on broomsticks.

38:34.069 --> 38:36.551
Didn't you never see
the Wizard of Oz?

38:36.571 --> 38:39.054
I need no broomstick to fly.

38:39.074 --> 38:40.555
Yeah?

38:40.575 --> 38:42.076
What do you need?

39:09.939 --> 39:11.440
You take Mastercard?

39:11.941 --> 39:14.040
With plenty of I.D. We do.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.541
20th century money. Great shit.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.043
Spend as much as you want

39:17.063 --> 39:18.564
till you hit your limit.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.569
Then you've got
50 bucks a whack.

39:42.473 --> 39:43.954
What was that?

39:43.974 --> 39:45.976
Fellas up in the hills
hunting coyote.

39:51.231 --> 39:53.233
You eat coyote around here, huh?

39:53.735 --> 39:55.236
Well, a boy over at
the trailer park

39:55.737 --> 39:56.738
was killed by one.

39:57.238 --> 39:58.239
They do that sometimes.

39:58.740 --> 40:00.241
A coyote will come down,
drag off a small child.

40:00.742 --> 40:02.224
Boy was fairly well
chewed up, so I hear.

40:02.244 --> 40:03.744
Skin taken clean off.

40:23.882 --> 40:25.384
Pray, wait.

40:27.386 --> 40:29.888
It was your son...
the boy killed?

40:31.891 --> 40:33.893
For your loss I grieve...

40:35.394 --> 40:37.877
But I have need
to ask one thing.

40:37.897 --> 40:39.879
Had he been baptized?

40:39.899 --> 40:40.630
Who are you?

40:40.650 --> 40:42.150
Why are you asking me this?

40:42.535 --> 40:44.537
Was the boy baptized?

40:44.904 --> 40:46.385
No.

40:46.405 --> 40:48.407
His father wouldn't allow it.

40:51.911 --> 40:53.392
So...

40:53.412 --> 40:54.393
Clue me.

40:54.413 --> 40:56.396
The warlock will
travel swifter now.

40:56.416 --> 40:57.917
I'm not tracking here.

40:58.418 --> 40:59.900
You think he killed the kid?

40:59.920 --> 41:01.902
Of all ingredients
used by a witch,

41:01.922 --> 41:03.403
the most coveted is human fat.

41:03.423 --> 41:05.906
If that fat is cut from
an unbaptized male child,

41:05.926 --> 41:08.408
there is but one purpose,
one thing it will beget.

41:08.428 --> 41:10.410
I'm listening.

41:10.430 --> 41:11.931
Flying potion.

42:02.484 --> 42:05.467
You got KKTY, Tucson,

42:05.487 --> 42:06.969
ridin' shotgun and
keepin' you company...

42:06.989 --> 42:08.971
No little people inside.

42:08.991 --> 42:10.472
Oh, I gathered.

42:10.492 --> 42:11.974
Wanna know how it works?

42:11.994 --> 42:13.976
If 'twill help find the warlock.

42:13.996 --> 42:15.497
Highly doubtful.

42:16.498 --> 42:17.980
Hey, you know the
earth is round?

42:18.000 --> 42:20.482
For some years now.

42:20.502 --> 42:21.984
Ask me anything.

42:22.004 --> 42:24.486
I took 2 years of high school.

42:24.506 --> 42:27.008
Come on. Ask me something.

42:30.013 --> 42:31.995
Why is it you paint your face?

42:32.015 --> 42:34.497
Nothing wrong with
a little makeup.

42:34.517 --> 42:35.999
Especially now.

42:36.019 --> 42:38.501
Satanists paint their
faces, not goodly women.

42:38.521 --> 42:40.136
Are you saying in 1691

42:40.156 --> 42:41.638
gals didn't wear any makeup?

42:41.658 --> 42:42.659
If my Marion had but...

42:44.160 --> 42:47.143
nay, goodly women do
not paint themselves.

42:47.163 --> 42:49.665
You married way back there?

42:51.668 --> 42:54.150
Well, you just said "my Marion."

42:54.170 --> 42:55.652
Who's she?

42:55.672 --> 42:57.153
We need new bearing.

42:57.173 --> 42:58.154
Your sister?

42:58.174 --> 42:59.656
Pray, stop the coach.

42:59.676 --> 43:01.158
Some squeeze? Stop here.

43:01.178 --> 43:02.160
Who the shit's Marion?

43:02.180 --> 43:04.047
Stop!

43:13.557 --> 43:17.060
Ohh, think then
talk, banana brain.

43:23.067 --> 43:24.568
God.

43:28.572 --> 43:30.073
Oh, God.

43:33.078 --> 43:34.079
Ohh...

43:34.579 --> 43:36.080
God.

43:51.346 --> 43:52.347
Ohh.

44:00.605 --> 44:03.222
Go on. Go without me.

44:03.242 --> 44:05.224
I don't wanna know
how bad it is.

44:05.244 --> 44:06.726
Please.

44:06.746 --> 44:07.728
Please, don't look.

44:07.748 --> 44:09.749
Please. No.

44:11.250 --> 44:12.732
Oh, my...

44:12.752 --> 44:15.254
Why couldn't he just kill me?

44:16.255 --> 44:19.605
Nothing could be
worse than this.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.760
His very thought.

45:24.358 --> 45:25.840
The cream's gone bad.

45:25.860 --> 45:26.841
Couldn't be.

45:26.861 --> 45:28.342
I brought it in just yesterday.

45:28.362 --> 45:29.363
Want to taste it?

45:29.864 --> 45:31.346
Nah, I got a lot of
work to do, dad.

45:31.366 --> 45:32.847
If you're done helping Elsie,

45:32.867 --> 45:35.119
maybe you can turn out
the horse for me.

45:46.765 --> 45:47.265
Hey.

45:47.766 --> 45:49.267
Hey.

46:04.533 --> 46:06.034
Come on, hurry up!

46:07.536 --> 46:09.539
I'm gonna beat you!

46:31.177 --> 46:33.159
Can I ask you a question?

46:33.179 --> 46:35.662
Will you please not have
a meltdown this time?

46:35.682 --> 46:36.683
Ask.

46:36.933 --> 46:38.434
Who's Marion?

46:40.938 --> 46:43.921
That's why you're after
the warlock, isn't it?

46:43.941 --> 46:46.924
Yesterday, you cared not
to know such things.

46:46.944 --> 46:49.446
Yesterday was 20 years ago.

46:51.448 --> 46:52.429
She...

46:52.449 --> 46:54.431
She was...

46:54.451 --> 46:55.933
Your age...

46:55.953 --> 46:57.454
your true age.

46:58.956 --> 47:00.958
What a blessed vision.

47:01.959 --> 47:04.441
A soul as pure as God's own,

47:04.461 --> 47:05.962
my Marion.

47:07.464 --> 47:09.466
She was my good wife.

47:09.717 --> 47:11.200
I thought you said
you weren't married.

47:11.220 --> 47:13.585
'Twas long ago,

47:13.605 --> 47:15.086
even before here I came.

47:15.106 --> 47:17.608
What happened to her?

47:21.613 --> 47:23.615
The warlock happened.

47:42.668 --> 47:44.150
Pray, stop the car.

47:44.170 --> 47:45.150
What's the matter?

47:45.170 --> 47:46.172
Pray, I bid you,
stop the car, girl!

47:52.178 --> 47:53.659
Redferne. The compass.

47:53.679 --> 47:54.660
Leave it!

47:54.680 --> 47:57.046
If God stands with us,
we'll need it no more!

47:57.066 --> 47:59.068
We didn't find him yet, did we?

48:02.688 --> 48:04.690
Well, would you look at this?

48:05.191 --> 48:05.691
Hmm?

48:06.192 --> 48:07.193
The bread. Didn't rise.

48:07.693 --> 48:08.694
Browned, but it didn't rise.

48:09.195 --> 48:10.676
Must've forgotten to...

48:10.696 --> 48:12.581
tell me your woes.

48:12.948 --> 48:14.450
You are bewitched.

48:14.951 --> 48:15.952
Who are you?

48:16.086 --> 48:18.068
The hex mark, is it
yours, or is it not?

48:18.088 --> 48:19.320
Hex mark? What?

48:19.340 --> 48:21.321
I haven't seen a hex
mark in 30 years.

48:21.341 --> 48:22.342
The mark is mine.

48:23.460 --> 48:24.941
Amish?

48:24.961 --> 48:26.345
Mennonite.

48:28.849 --> 48:30.851
And we are bewitched.

48:36.223 --> 48:37.224
From there.

48:38.108 --> 48:39.589
Hither has he come.

48:39.609 --> 48:40.610
Hammer, nails.

48:54.992 --> 48:57.475
Dad, what the devil do
you think you're doing?

48:57.495 --> 48:58.746
Who are these people?

48:59.247 --> 49:00.862
If there are children
present, make them absent.

49:00.882 --> 49:02.383
Take them and leave.

49:02.500 --> 49:04.482
Leave? Wait a minute.
I got a schedule to keep.

49:04.502 --> 49:06.984
I can't just traipse off
and turn this place over...

49:07.004 --> 49:08.486
listen to me.

49:08.506 --> 49:10.488
The horse that sweats
in the morning,

49:10.508 --> 49:11.989
cream that sours overnight.

49:12.009 --> 49:13.510
You know the signs.

49:14.762 --> 49:16.264
We both know.

49:26.275 --> 49:27.776
Fix these pennies here.

49:29.278 --> 49:31.780
'Twill ward off
any errant magic.

49:32.781 --> 49:33.762
On my word,

49:33.782 --> 49:35.264
close and brace the stairs.

49:35.284 --> 49:38.267
You must open them
only when I say.

49:38.287 --> 49:40.269
And should ever
your eyes meet his,

49:40.289 --> 49:41.770
never show him no fear.

49:41.790 --> 49:43.792
'Tis the air he breathes.

50:03.313 --> 50:04.314
Hey.

50:06.316 --> 50:08.201
Careful.

51:37.994 --> 51:39.879
He was here.

52:20.921 --> 52:23.925
"Mortes datoris antipueris."

52:37.939 --> 52:39.440
He's come for it.

52:41.442 --> 52:42.924
Blessings of heaven,

52:42.944 --> 52:44.445
'tis the Grand
Grimoire he's after!

52:46.948 --> 52:48.546
The spell book.

52:48.566 --> 52:51.549
All witches keep grimoires,
yet one is indestructible.

52:51.569 --> 52:53.551
One is the bible of black magic.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.554
The Grand Grimoire.

52:55.574 --> 52:57.523
Always witches have
lusted for it.

52:57.543 --> 52:59.525
And now here I find a page.

52:59.545 --> 53:01.527
One lone page.

53:01.547 --> 53:04.029
'Twas last held by
a Boston church.

53:04.049 --> 53:05.531
The West End Church.

53:05.551 --> 53:07.533
I had urged them
to third the book,

53:07.553 --> 53:09.535
thus thirding the chance
of a witch thieving it.

53:09.555 --> 53:11.538
But the pages were to be
kept on hallowed ground,

53:11.558 --> 53:13.559
not scattered about
the landside like...

53:14.059 --> 53:14.559
where's the warlock?

53:15.060 --> 53:15.560
He's fled.

53:16.061 --> 53:17.062
I don't get it.

53:17.563 --> 53:19.545
If thing is so
bitchin' to witches,

53:19.565 --> 53:21.046
why would he leave a page?

53:21.066 --> 53:22.567
Even just a page.

53:26.072 --> 53:27.573
He would not.

53:29.075 --> 53:30.076
The steps!

53:45.792 --> 53:48.294
Of all the curiosities
here I've seen,

53:48.795 --> 53:51.277
none have surprised
me more than this.

53:51.297 --> 53:52.298
The brace!

53:57.805 --> 53:59.807
Forgotten witches fly?

54:02.693 --> 54:04.194
I forget nothing.

54:06.197 --> 54:09.700
Who appointed you
executioner, Redferne?

54:10.201 --> 54:11.702
'Twas you yourself...

54:12.203 --> 54:14.205
When one life too many

54:14.705 --> 54:15.706
you did steal.

54:32.224 --> 54:35.727
It seems even 2 thirds
can work marvels.

55:47.668 --> 55:49.169
Why'd you let him go?

56:14.445 --> 56:15.696
Yes!

56:44.443 --> 56:45.944
Remove his boots! His boots!

56:54.320 --> 56:56.822
Where's my goddamn bracelet?

57:00.075 --> 57:01.076
Ew!

57:02.578 --> 57:04.581
Hold his toe.

57:09.586 --> 57:12.589
Where's my goddamn bracelet?

57:13.056 --> 57:15.539
Nay. Look not in his eyes!

57:15.559 --> 57:17.060
Nay!

57:30.190 --> 57:31.574
Oh.

57:39.200 --> 57:40.565
He's getting away!

57:40.585 --> 57:42.567
Keys. Find me brass keys.

57:42.587 --> 57:44.068
With them I can remove this hex.

57:44.088 --> 57:45.937
The warlock. You can't just
let him blow out of here.

57:45.957 --> 57:47.959
He'll die should I leave!

57:49.460 --> 57:51.462
The hammer!

57:51.712 --> 57:52.693
Take it.

57:52.713 --> 57:55.098
Where you find his tracks,
nail the earth deeply.

57:55.600 --> 57:57.081
A nail. Shitty little nail!

57:57.101 --> 57:58.583
Give me a shotgun, then I'll...

57:58.603 --> 58:00.084
take the blessed hammer!

58:00.104 --> 58:01.605
He can be crippled!

58:23.378 --> 58:24.879
Nails.

59:01.417 --> 59:02.918
Help you?

59:04.420 --> 59:06.288
No, no.

01:02:30.884 --> 01:02:31.718
Feel.

01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:35.971
Mmm.

01:02:36.472 --> 01:02:39.956
The keys should be spun
once each hour, clockwise.

01:02:39.976 --> 01:02:41.457
Meddle not with the dressing.

01:02:41.477 --> 01:02:44.460
By morn' the blood shall stop.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.481
How's he doing?

01:02:51.989 --> 01:02:53.490
I have no excuse.

01:02:53.991 --> 01:02:56.974
Safe to say that having
seen so many die

01:02:56.994 --> 01:02:57.995
by the warlock's hand,

01:02:58.495 --> 01:03:00.978
the chance to spare just
one life with mine own...

01:03:00.998 --> 01:03:01.999
forget it.

01:03:02.366 --> 01:03:03.347
I understand.

01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:04.348
Besides...

01:03:04.368 --> 01:03:06.370
I got it back.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.371
Then let's tarry not.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.010
We'll rebuild the compass.

01:03:15.512 --> 01:03:17.514
Brass, copper, glass.

01:03:18.015 --> 01:03:21.019
'Tis this, his blood,
that matters most.

01:03:27.142 --> 01:03:28.623
Here.

01:03:28.643 --> 01:03:30.144
And here.

01:03:30.645 --> 01:03:32.127
You've watched me long enough.

01:03:32.147 --> 01:03:33.127
The gas is on the right,

01:03:33.147 --> 01:03:34.128
the brake's on the left.

01:03:34.148 --> 01:03:35.631
It's more than I knew
when I started to drive.

01:03:35.651 --> 01:03:37.132
Drive, me?

01:03:37.152 --> 01:03:38.633
And take this. It's for gas.

01:03:38.653 --> 01:03:40.135
When they give you
the slip of paper,

01:03:40.155 --> 01:03:41.137
just scribble a name.

01:03:41.157 --> 01:03:43.158
Any name. They never check.

01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:44.273
You're not coming?

01:03:44.293 --> 01:03:45.774
Look, you got my car, my money...

01:03:45.794 --> 01:03:49.297
My best wishes.

01:03:49.414 --> 01:03:51.397
Later days, Redferne.

01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:53.032
We had a deal, remember?

01:03:53.052 --> 01:03:55.034
Just till I got
my bracelet back.

01:03:55.054 --> 01:03:56.535
That was it, man.

01:03:56.555 --> 01:03:57.556
That was it.

01:03:57.807 --> 01:03:59.288
You know what he's capable of.

01:03:59.308 --> 01:04:00.790
You've seen.

01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:02.541
Why do you think I'm not going?

01:04:02.561 --> 01:04:04.679
What are you called?

01:04:05.181 --> 01:04:07.663
It's a little late for
introductions, ain't it?

01:04:07.683 --> 01:04:09.165
Your name.

01:04:09.185 --> 01:04:10.666
Kassandra with a "K."

01:04:10.686 --> 01:04:11.666
Then hear me well,

01:04:11.686 --> 01:04:12.802
Kassandra with a "K."

01:04:12.822 --> 01:04:15.805
The warlock holds 2
parts of the book.

01:04:15.825 --> 01:04:17.326
This much he confessed.

01:04:17.827 --> 01:04:20.810
Know you what happens
should he gain all 3?

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:23.083
I don't want to know.

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:24.431
I don't.

01:04:24.451 --> 01:04:26.933
Hidden within that book
is the name of God.

01:04:26.953 --> 01:04:28.435
The lost name of God.

01:04:28.455 --> 01:04:30.957
The lost name of...

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.961
Uh-uh.

01:04:35.462 --> 01:04:36.943
I don't want to hear this.

01:04:36.963 --> 01:04:39.446
'Tis the name invoked
during creation.

01:04:39.466 --> 01:04:42.949
Witches charge that
should this name,

01:04:42.969 --> 01:04:45.952
this true name of God, be
uttered back to front...

01:04:45.972 --> 01:04:47.454
I'm not listening.
LA LA LA LA LA...

01:04:47.474 --> 01:04:49.456
Should this name be
uttered in reverse,

01:04:49.476 --> 01:04:53.481
all creation will undo.
'Twill reverse.

01:04:55.483 --> 01:04:57.465
We'll uncreate?

01:04:57.485 --> 01:04:58.966
That what you're telling me?

01:04:58.986 --> 01:04:59.968
The whole world just...

01:04:59.988 --> 01:05:03.221
all worlds, Kassandra. All.

01:05:03.241 --> 01:05:04.242
Ohh.

01:05:08.246 --> 01:05:11.112
He scares the crap out of me,

01:05:11.132 --> 01:05:12.133
and he knows it.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.982
I'll not let him harm you.

01:05:15.002 --> 01:05:17.985
Next time there won't
be any spells.

01:05:18.005 --> 01:05:19.487
No hexes, no potions.

01:05:19.507 --> 01:05:22.009
Next time he's gonna kill me.

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:25.013
I'll not let him harm you.

01:05:35.858 --> 01:05:36.973
We travel north?

01:05:36.993 --> 01:05:38.474
Trust me on this, ok?

01:05:38.494 --> 01:05:40.476
But if all along the
warlock has borne east...

01:05:40.496 --> 01:05:42.477
we're not going to play tag
with this guy anymore.

01:05:42.497 --> 01:05:43.499
What would you have us do?

01:05:43.999 --> 01:05:45.481
Did kids in 1691
ever play a game

01:05:45.501 --> 01:05:47.503
where they jump over
someone else's back?

01:05:48.003 --> 01:05:48.984
Leaping frog?

01:05:49.004 --> 01:05:50.986
There you go.
Instead of tag, we play leapfrog.

01:05:51.006 --> 01:05:52.488
When we get to that
church in Boston

01:05:52.508 --> 01:05:53.989
they got to have records, right?

01:05:54.009 --> 01:05:54.991
Forget the warlock.

01:05:55.011 --> 01:05:57.494
We'll find the last part
of the book instead.

01:05:57.514 --> 01:05:59.883
But what happens if the
church is no longer standing?

01:06:01.885 --> 01:06:02.886
I didn't shoot your
plan full of holes.

01:06:05.388 --> 01:06:08.004
Is that, like, the
old West End Church,

01:06:08.024 --> 01:06:09.525
or is that the new
West End Church?

01:06:11.394 --> 01:06:12.876
The one on Somerset Avenue?

01:06:12.896 --> 01:06:14.377
Nay. 'Twould be Somerset Road.

01:06:14.397 --> 01:06:15.898
Oh! Close enough.

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.401
Thanks, operator.

01:06:22.906 --> 01:06:24.908
Still got that knife?

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.391
Give me it.

01:06:27.411 --> 01:06:28.392
My bodkin?

01:06:28.412 --> 01:06:30.394
No, your knife.

01:06:30.414 --> 01:06:33.898
Come on. We'll check it with my bag.
It's ok.

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:34.899
Ok.

01:06:34.919 --> 01:06:35.920
Um...

01:06:37.421 --> 01:06:38.403
Ok, how about that whip?

01:06:38.423 --> 01:06:39.403
What of it?

01:06:39.423 --> 01:06:40.905
They're not going to let
you on board with that.

01:06:40.925 --> 01:06:42.426
On board what?

01:06:42.676 --> 01:06:45.178
Just give me the whip, ok?

01:06:48.933 --> 01:06:50.818
That comes to $596.36.

01:06:51.318 --> 01:06:52.800
Cash, check, or charge?

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.801
Charge...

01:06:53.821 --> 01:06:55.322
I think.

01:06:58.326 --> 01:06:59.808
Excuse me. Gate 40?

01:06:59.828 --> 01:07:01.579
Sure. Just go down the
hall, turn right,

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.178
then through the double
doors on your left.

01:07:03.198 --> 01:07:04.199
Thanks.

01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:08.202
Oh, no.

01:07:09.704 --> 01:07:11.186
The computer must be down.

01:07:11.206 --> 01:07:12.840
Timing, huh?

01:07:14.843 --> 01:07:15.710
You know, we better hurry,

01:07:16.211 --> 01:07:19.214
or we're going to
miss this plane.

01:07:22.217 --> 01:07:23.218
Redferne?

01:07:24.219 --> 01:07:25.220
Come on, let's tarry not.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.701
What...

01:07:26.721 --> 01:07:28.703
these winged machines...

01:07:28.723 --> 01:07:30.206
the ones that thunder...

01:07:30.226 --> 01:07:31.207
Planes.

01:07:31.227 --> 01:07:33.709
But men travel inside them...

01:07:33.729 --> 01:07:34.711
Through the air?

01:07:34.731 --> 01:07:36.732
Men like us. Come on.

01:07:37.233 --> 01:07:38.714
Oh, no, no.

01:07:38.734 --> 01:07:40.216
Look, you...

01:07:40.236 --> 01:07:41.716
In my day, those even
endeavoring to fly

01:07:41.736 --> 01:07:42.717
are accused of witchery.

01:07:42.737 --> 01:07:43.739
No, no, look yourself, ok?

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.721
The book is in Boston.

01:07:45.741 --> 01:07:46.723
That means we got
to beam out there

01:07:46.743 --> 01:07:48.224
and find someone who knows.

01:07:48.244 --> 01:07:50.226
My boots work best with
ground beneath them.

01:07:50.246 --> 01:07:51.226
Directly beneath.

01:07:51.246 --> 01:07:52.729
What am I going to
have to do here?

01:07:52.749 --> 01:07:54.730
Hold your...

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.732
oh, shit.

01:07:56.752 --> 01:07:57.753
Where did you get this?

01:07:58.254 --> 01:07:59.235
The farmhouse.

01:07:59.255 --> 01:08:00.757
I know, but you're going
to have to leave it here.

01:08:01.008 --> 01:08:02.489
I'll not abandon
my every weapon.

01:08:02.509 --> 01:08:03.490
Look...

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:04.492
We're going to miss our plane.

01:08:04.512 --> 01:08:05.492
Give it to me.

01:08:05.512 --> 01:08:06.493
I'll not.

01:08:06.513 --> 01:08:07.878
Look, Buster,

01:08:07.898 --> 01:08:08.880
I'm in charge of
this safari now,

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.401
and if I say you're going to...

01:08:15.022 --> 01:08:16.023
keep it. Keep it?

01:08:16.523 --> 01:08:19.024
Quit arguing with me
and just keep it!

01:08:23.529 --> 01:08:24.913
Boston.

01:08:45.687 --> 01:08:47.167
Looks like you just made it.

01:08:47.188 --> 01:08:48.670
You're telling me.

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:49.671
Can I take that for you?

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.693
Over my rotting corpse.

01:08:54.194 --> 01:08:55.676
Family heirloom.

01:08:55.697 --> 01:08:56.698
Ah.

01:09:16.885 --> 01:09:18.386
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:09:18.886 --> 01:09:19.868
Hey.

01:09:19.888 --> 01:09:20.889
Like this.

01:09:23.892 --> 01:09:25.874
Get passive, huh?

01:09:25.894 --> 01:09:29.397
You can actually get
some sleep here.

01:10:00.547 --> 01:10:02.028
What now?

01:10:02.048 --> 01:10:03.530
There's a witch among us.

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:04.531
Set me free.

01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:06.033
The vane.

01:10:06.053 --> 01:10:07.035
Where did that wench
put the vane?

01:10:07.055 --> 01:10:09.036
Wait. Take a minute here, huh?

01:10:09.056 --> 01:10:10.538
We're, like, 39 million
feet in the air.

01:10:10.558 --> 01:10:12.560
There's no way he
could be on board.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.042
Cream that spoils,

01:10:14.062 --> 01:10:15.543
a flame that burns pure blue...

01:10:15.563 --> 01:10:17.545
there's no way, Redferne.

01:10:17.565 --> 01:10:19.046
I know all the signs!

01:10:19.066 --> 01:10:21.048
Look, I know he's not here.

01:10:21.068 --> 01:10:23.551
How?

01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:25.573
How is it you're so sure?

01:10:27.074 --> 01:10:28.055
You saw him.

01:10:28.075 --> 01:10:30.057
We're after the book now.
Remember?

01:10:30.077 --> 01:10:32.059
You saw him, and
you told me not!

01:10:32.079 --> 01:10:34.061
We left him behind, Redferne.

01:10:34.081 --> 01:10:36.565
Look, we're halfway to Boston.

01:10:36.585 --> 01:10:38.067
He's back there beeping
the X-ray machines.

01:10:38.087 --> 01:10:39.587
Forget him, ok?

01:10:39.721 --> 01:10:41.339
He's with us still.

01:10:42.841 --> 01:10:45.323
Now I'll search thither.

01:10:45.343 --> 01:10:46.825
You, thither.

01:10:46.845 --> 01:10:48.326
Keep your wits about you...

01:10:48.346 --> 01:10:50.348
Such as they are.

01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:49.542
Excuse me.

01:11:52.546 --> 01:11:54.027
Well?

01:11:54.047 --> 01:11:55.529
I cannot reason this.

01:11:55.549 --> 01:11:57.030
There is witchery afoot.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:00.033
I draw breath and taste it.

01:12:00.053 --> 01:12:03.036
Maybe there's another
witch afoot.

01:12:03.056 --> 01:12:04.538
Could be, like, Glenda,

01:12:04.558 --> 01:12:05.559
Good Witch of the West.

01:12:06.059 --> 01:12:07.060
A good witch?

01:12:09.062 --> 01:12:10.564
Sweet dreams, Redferne.

01:12:14.569 --> 01:12:16.070
Good witch.

01:13:19.052 --> 01:13:21.034
Let me guess...
California, right?

01:13:21.054 --> 01:13:22.555
How'd you know?

01:13:24.057 --> 01:13:25.539
Bear to your left.

01:13:25.559 --> 01:13:26.540
What?

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.542
'Twas Boston common
we just now passed?

01:13:28.562 --> 01:13:29.543
Yeah.

01:13:29.563 --> 01:13:32.045
And we travel north
on Tremont Road?

01:13:32.065 --> 01:13:33.047
Yeah, we're on Tremont.

01:13:33.067 --> 01:13:34.915
Then bear west.

01:13:34.935 --> 01:13:36.917
The church lies not far off.

01:13:36.937 --> 01:13:38.418
Think I'll keep going this way,

01:13:38.438 --> 01:13:39.920
loop around onto Cambridge.

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:40.920
Nay, turn here. Here!

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:41.923
Hey, look, pal,

01:13:41.943 --> 01:13:43.423
I know this town pretty good.

01:13:43.443 --> 01:13:45.927
I've lived here since 1958.

01:13:45.947 --> 01:13:47.428
How about you?

01:13:47.448 --> 01:13:48.930
Don't answer that.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:52.433
Lest you favor throttlings
to the ears and face,

01:13:52.453 --> 01:13:53.935
bear west here.

01:13:53.955 --> 01:13:57.458
They wonder why we
hate the Lakers.

01:14:06.851 --> 01:14:08.853
Pray, might we speak inside?

01:14:09.353 --> 01:14:10.835
Speak?

01:14:10.855 --> 01:14:11.605
It's important.

01:14:12.106 --> 01:14:13.087
It really is.

01:14:13.107 --> 01:14:15.841
Maybe you could come back
tomorrow in the morning.

01:14:15.861 --> 01:14:18.210
Any time after 8:30 or
call the church office.

01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:20.232
Regarding the Grand Grimoire.

01:14:40.252 --> 01:14:41.734
Some of the other clergy
know about it, too.

01:14:41.754 --> 01:14:43.735
I'm not the only one
who's seen the records,

01:14:43.755 --> 01:14:46.739
but nobody seems to
recall how or why

01:14:46.759 --> 01:14:48.741
it came into church hands.

01:14:48.761 --> 01:14:51.244
Some sort of witches'
book, isn't it?

01:14:51.264 --> 01:14:53.746
Can we see those records...
Tonight?

01:14:53.766 --> 01:14:55.748
Church papers wouldn't
be for sale...

01:14:55.768 --> 01:14:57.250
At any price.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.252
You are document collectors,

01:14:59.272 --> 01:15:00.253
isn't that it?

01:15:00.273 --> 01:15:02.755
We aren't here to buy anything.

01:15:02.775 --> 01:15:05.258
We just have to find that book.

01:15:05.278 --> 01:15:07.260
It's not here, if that's
what you're hoping.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.262
It was broken up long ago

01:15:09.282 --> 01:15:10.783
and divided into...

01:15:18.042 --> 01:15:19.523
he's here.

01:15:19.543 --> 01:15:22.026
The wretch is on us
like a tail on a hound.

01:15:22.046 --> 01:15:23.028
No, he's not here.

01:15:23.048 --> 01:15:24.548
He is. He's not.

01:15:31.055 --> 01:15:33.037
Can I ask what your interest is

01:15:33.057 --> 01:15:34.058
in finding such a book?

01:15:35.693 --> 01:15:36.675
Our interest lies

01:15:36.695 --> 01:15:40.177
in stopping those who would
see all good falter.

01:15:40.197 --> 01:15:42.179
It lies in stopping
the powers of misrule

01:15:42.199 --> 01:15:43.681
from coming of age.

01:15:43.701 --> 01:15:45.703
It lies in finding
that damned book

01:15:46.203 --> 01:15:47.685
and thwarting a
vile beast of a man

01:15:47.705 --> 01:15:50.188
who shall not rest until
God himself is thrown down

01:15:50.208 --> 01:15:51.190
and all of creation becomes

01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:53.711
Satan's black-hell-besmeared
farting hole.

01:15:56.715 --> 01:15:57.716
You asked.

01:16:03.088 --> 01:16:04.569
Here.

01:16:04.589 --> 01:16:06.571
"Chronicled in the
year of the Lord

01:16:06.591 --> 01:16:08.573
"sixteen hundred ninety and two,

01:16:08.593 --> 01:16:10.094
"Township of Boston,

01:16:10.595 --> 01:16:13.078
"some few remarks upon
a book most dire...

01:16:13.098 --> 01:16:16.581
"called by some the
book of shadows,

01:16:16.601 --> 01:16:18.083
"by others, the Key of Solomon,

01:16:18.103 --> 01:16:19.584
"and named by others still

01:16:19.604 --> 01:16:20.587
the Grand Grimoire."

01:16:20.607 --> 01:16:22.088
Aye, that's the one.

01:16:22.108 --> 01:16:24.090
"...the need for exquisite caution.

01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:27.093
Many-faced lieutenants
of Lucifer."

01:16:27.113 --> 01:16:28.593
Well, the language
gets pretty thick,

01:16:28.613 --> 01:16:29.615
but I remember something about

01:16:30.116 --> 01:16:31.098
how the book was distributed.

01:16:31.118 --> 01:16:32.098
Like, where?

01:16:32.118 --> 01:16:33.619
Let's see, uh...

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.102
"One part was placed

01:16:35.122 --> 01:16:37.103
"within the slender
hollow of a table

01:16:37.123 --> 01:16:38.604
used in the taking
of communion."

01:16:38.624 --> 01:16:39.605
Chas' table.

01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:41.607
"Another part was
given to a vicar

01:16:41.627 --> 01:16:43.128
"who had recently
founded a ministry

01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:44.611
west of the Carolinas."

01:16:44.631 --> 01:16:46.112
The farmhouse.

01:16:46.132 --> 01:16:47.114
"And the third part..."

01:16:47.134 --> 01:16:48.614
Yeah? Yeah?

01:16:48.634 --> 01:16:50.116
Well, if I'm reading
this correctly,

01:16:50.136 --> 01:16:52.619
the third part might
still be here in Boston.

01:16:52.639 --> 01:16:55.122
Oh, was this a plan or what?

01:16:55.142 --> 01:16:56.623
Ok, where?

01:16:56.643 --> 01:16:58.125
A graveyard?

01:16:58.145 --> 01:16:59.626
A burial ground... one I know.

01:16:59.646 --> 01:17:01.628
Now we're going to
go dig up graves?

01:17:01.648 --> 01:17:02.630
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?

01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:04.651
If luck looks upon us,
there'll be no digging.

01:17:05.152 --> 01:17:06.134
For should the earth
there be hallowed,

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:08.135
then the pages lie safe.

01:17:08.155 --> 01:17:09.636
Never can no witch set foot

01:17:09.656 --> 01:17:11.157
on consecrated ground.

01:17:12.659 --> 01:17:14.661
Whose idea was this?

01:17:15.162 --> 01:17:17.144
So much has changed,

01:17:17.164 --> 01:17:19.666
yet at times, I spy a
familiar stretch of park

01:17:20.167 --> 01:17:22.650
or turn of the road.

01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:23.671
Over there.

01:17:34.682 --> 01:17:36.164
Did you hear that?

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:38.166
Hear what?

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.168
I don't know. It was a soft...

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:42.170
Sort of like...

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.691
A soft...

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:29.102
I'll say good evening...

01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:32.125
Even though it does
seem unwarranted.

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:46.619
The two who were here
earlier this night...

01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:48.140
what was told them?

01:18:51.144 --> 01:18:52.645
The man Redferne.

01:18:54.147 --> 01:18:55.628
Well, we...

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:57.150
Talked about many things.

01:18:57.651 --> 01:19:00.134
Then talk to me of pages...

01:19:00.154 --> 01:19:03.387
of pages and places most secret.

01:19:03.407 --> 01:19:05.639
Pages?

01:19:05.659 --> 01:19:07.141
I'm afraid I don't know

01:19:07.161 --> 01:19:08.912
what you're referring to.

01:19:09.413 --> 01:19:10.414
Sit you down!

01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:22.293
And let you sit, too.

01:19:38.059 --> 01:19:40.061
I feel them.

01:19:41.563 --> 01:19:42.564
Them?

01:19:44.065 --> 01:19:47.549
How could you know that?

01:19:47.569 --> 01:19:49.551
A boy child...

01:19:49.571 --> 01:19:51.072
And a girl.

01:19:52.574 --> 01:19:54.556
Both shall be born well-favored,

01:19:54.576 --> 01:19:58.079
providing he tells
me what I need know.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:02.584
Please tell him, Stewart.

01:20:04.587 --> 01:20:06.569
Tell me, Stewart,

01:20:06.589 --> 01:20:08.070
lest your children be born

01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:11.093
slugs of cold flesh.

01:20:11.594 --> 01:20:13.095
Tell me now.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.411
How do we know if
it's holy ground?

01:20:29.913 --> 01:20:30.914
We'll know.

01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:52.436
Is that good?

01:20:54.438 --> 01:20:55.919
The ground has been consecrated.

01:20:55.939 --> 01:20:57.921
Well, that's it, right?

01:20:57.941 --> 01:20:58.923
The pages are safe.

01:20:58.943 --> 01:21:00.945
Should they still be here.

01:21:01.446 --> 01:21:03.928
The pastor, he spoke of a tomb

01:21:03.948 --> 01:21:05.430
carved with a hex mark.

01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:07.952
I'll search thither,
you thither.

01:21:08.453 --> 01:21:09.434
A hex mark?

01:21:09.454 --> 01:21:10.455
Aye.

01:21:11.956 --> 01:21:13.958
A hex mark.

01:21:51.113 --> 01:21:52.114
Redferne.

01:21:55.117 --> 01:21:56.098
Like this?

01:21:56.118 --> 01:21:57.119
Like this.

01:22:00.622 --> 01:22:02.624
The bolts are sound.

01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:06.109
There has been no meddling
in all this while.

01:22:06.129 --> 01:22:07.611
You mean we're not
going to open it?

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:09.612
Nay.
We'll leave it as we found it.

01:22:09.632 --> 01:22:11.614
Good call. Trust me.

01:22:11.634 --> 01:22:15.137
We don't want to open this
unless we really... really gotta.

01:22:33.156 --> 01:22:34.889
Come on, Redferne.

01:22:34.909 --> 01:22:37.411
I think Giles is a nice name.

01:22:39.914 --> 01:22:42.416
What, you expected
to live forever?

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:45.419
Well, at least we
didn't have to open it.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.902
I mean, we didn't have to stare

01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:49.924
at your putrefied
corpse or anything.

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:04.688
Uh-oh.

01:23:06.942 --> 01:23:08.944
What's the deal here?

01:23:20.872 --> 01:23:22.373
Redferne!

01:23:22.874 --> 01:23:25.357
Get back here! Redferne!

01:23:25.377 --> 01:23:26.858
They're moving graves!

01:23:26.878 --> 01:23:29.361
That sign says something
about a landfill,

01:23:29.381 --> 01:23:30.362
about condos!

01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:31.864
They're moving people
from this side

01:23:31.884 --> 01:23:33.365
of the graveyard to that side.

01:23:33.385 --> 01:23:34.866
And so?

01:23:34.886 --> 01:23:36.520
I had this awful thought.

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.623
What if that side of the wall...

01:23:40.643 --> 01:23:43.646
Wasn't part of the
real graveyard?

01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:26.753
You know, I bet you're
aren't even in here.

01:24:26.773 --> 01:24:28.755
The pages maybe, but not you.

01:24:28.775 --> 01:24:31.258
Are you daft?
'Tis mine own casket.

01:24:31.278 --> 01:24:32.260
Yeah, but you're not dead.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.760
You're right here.

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.263
Look, before you died, you
came to the 20th century.

01:24:36.283 --> 01:24:37.265
Think of it that way.

01:24:37.285 --> 01:24:41.269
How could there be tomb
and casket but I died?

01:24:41.289 --> 01:24:43.291
Guess we find out the hard way.

01:24:48.296 --> 01:24:50.798
Hey. I'll do it.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.284
Now, don't look till I
say it's ok to look, ok?

01:24:56.304 --> 01:24:57.805
Just be quick about it.

01:25:04.312 --> 01:25:06.294
Well?

01:25:06.314 --> 01:25:08.796
Better not look.

01:25:08.816 --> 01:25:11.300
Is there a body inside mine own?

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.801
Better not look.

01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:14.303
Can I look now?

01:25:14.323 --> 01:25:15.824
No. Better not.

01:25:16.959 --> 01:25:18.941
Oh, blessings of heaven.

01:25:18.961 --> 01:25:19.943
What'd you expect?

01:25:19.963 --> 01:25:22.945
I said better not
look, and you looked.

01:25:22.965 --> 01:25:23.947
How dumb can you be?

01:25:23.967 --> 01:25:26.468
The pages... take them and hurry.

01:25:28.971 --> 01:25:29.972
Hurry!

01:25:52.495 --> 01:25:53.977
Oh, yuck.

01:25:53.997 --> 01:25:55.498
I said hurry, did I not?

01:26:01.504 --> 01:26:03.987
Doesn't hurt a bit.

01:26:04.007 --> 01:26:06.509
Just a couple more.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.003
All that remains is to
see the pages back to...

01:26:19.023 --> 01:26:20.024
Hallowed ground.

01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:33.851
Redferne?

01:26:33.871 --> 01:26:34.872
Aye.

01:26:35.373 --> 01:26:36.374
I think he's here.

01:26:41.746 --> 01:26:43.130
The pages.

01:26:52.391 --> 01:26:53.872
Take off.

01:26:53.892 --> 01:26:54.873
Take off!

01:26:54.893 --> 01:26:56.895
Go!

01:27:46.813 --> 01:27:48.816
No!

01:27:52.319 --> 01:27:53.801
Come out, Redferne.

01:27:53.821 --> 01:27:55.322
Show yourself!

01:28:07.084 --> 01:28:08.065
God!

01:28:08.085 --> 01:28:10.087
Virtuous idea.

01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:14.091
Stop!

01:28:15.592 --> 01:28:19.077
What you hold for what I hold.

01:28:19.097 --> 01:28:20.731
A straight swap of goods.

01:28:21.099 --> 01:28:22.600
Your offer seems light.

01:28:23.101 --> 01:28:25.083
All will die should
I give these up.

01:28:25.103 --> 01:28:26.584
The uncreation?

01:28:26.604 --> 01:28:29.087
Only the daft believe
such a thing.

01:28:29.107 --> 01:28:31.089
The pages, Redferne.

01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:32.090
Give them up.

01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:34.092
No! Don't you dare!

01:28:34.112 --> 01:28:35.593
Believe it, Redferne.

01:28:35.613 --> 01:28:37.595
Her death will make all others

01:28:37.615 --> 01:28:39.597
seem like a pet tea party.

01:28:39.617 --> 01:28:42.600
And you, you who
stand there cow-like

01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:43.758
on hallowed earth,

01:28:43.921 --> 01:28:45.978
shall hear every whimper,

01:28:45.998 --> 01:28:47.605
every cry,

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:49.608
every gasping gush I can bring

01:28:49.628 --> 01:28:52.130
from her slow-dying body.

01:28:54.133 --> 01:28:55.134
See her...

01:28:55.634 --> 01:28:58.617
the mouth, the
legs, the breasts.

01:28:58.637 --> 01:29:02.621
So much like those of
someone once you knew,

01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:05.624
of someone both we knew.

01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:08.627
Well, Redferne, shall she live,

01:29:08.647 --> 01:29:12.651
or shall she join sweet
Marion in the hereafter?

01:29:14.153 --> 01:29:15.654
Take the pages.

01:29:26.616 --> 01:29:28.899
But take them by hand.

01:29:28.919 --> 01:29:30.901
How's this?

01:29:30.921 --> 01:29:34.905
No spells, no flying, no magic.

01:29:34.925 --> 01:29:36.907
Take them, if you're able.

01:29:36.927 --> 01:29:39.659
Now who makes the hollow offer?

01:29:39.679 --> 01:29:42.181
You give up nothing.

01:29:48.071 --> 01:29:51.074
Take the pages, if you're able.

01:29:54.078 --> 01:29:56.080
So, you fear me.

01:29:59.083 --> 01:30:02.086
'Tis I who others fear.

01:30:02.587 --> 01:30:05.570
Not you. The magic.

01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:07.572
Having waited so long,

01:30:07.592 --> 01:30:11.596
it could prove wonderfully
good to linger on it.

01:31:01.514 --> 01:31:04.517
Fear... tell me how it feels.

01:31:18.531 --> 01:31:21.534
Feels as if the
rules have changed.

01:32:18.093 --> 01:32:22.827
I am he of empty crib
and stillborn foal.

01:32:22.847 --> 01:32:26.831
I am he whose coming the
stars hath foretold.

01:32:26.851 --> 01:32:31.837
I am he with heart
forged by blackest coal.

01:32:31.857 --> 01:32:35.841
I am he who makest whole
the glorious goal

01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:38.864
of Satan's unborn soul!

01:32:50.509 --> 01:32:55.263
Now reveal unto me
the name of God.

01:33:01.138 --> 01:33:02.772
Oh, no. No.

01:33:31.803 --> 01:33:33.785
I know thee!

01:33:33.805 --> 01:33:36.174
I know your name!

01:33:37.675 --> 01:33:42.543
I know the word that can
undo all you have wrought!

01:33:42.563 --> 01:33:45.682
Yea, I know thee!

01:33:45.817 --> 01:33:47.435
Nay, nay, say it not!

01:33:58.196 --> 01:34:01.199
Try saltwater, fuckbrain.

01:35:48.059 --> 01:35:51.042
You are owed a debt greater
than any we'll know,

01:35:51.062 --> 01:35:53.044
save one.

01:35:53.064 --> 01:35:58.049
From me, then, a world
of thanks, Kassandra.

01:35:58.069 --> 01:36:00.071
Kassandra with a "K."

01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:19.572
Had our 2 lives

01:36:19.592 --> 01:36:21.880
been not so out of joint...

01:36:22.406 --> 01:36:23.773
Had we...

01:36:26.098 --> 01:36:27.599
What I mean to say is...

01:36:53.554 --> 01:36:54.628
Redferne.

01:37:21.406 --> 01:37:22.907
Oh.

01:37:28.974 --> 01:37:30.110
Oh.

01:37:31.697 --> 01:37:33.050
Shoot.

01:38:34.731 --> 01:38:37.714
Whoo ho!

01:38:37.734 --> 01:38:38.735
Yeow!
