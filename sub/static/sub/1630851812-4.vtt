00:14.932 --> 00:17.142
Those don't look like the ones on the box.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.854
They're not supposed to, stupid.
They're homemade.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.776
-Crystal, I'm good. Chill out. Crys.
-Stop playing. Just try it.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.985
Seriously. Jace.

00:30.781 --> 00:34.701
This is nasty. This is bad, yo.
Straight tastes like dirt.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.540
I don't know what I did wrong.

00:39.623 --> 00:43.377
Me neither. Let me try another one.
Maybe I just got a bad one or something.

00:45.295 --> 00:49.299
Nah. This one's bad too.
Just not as bad. I'll just…

00:52.135 --> 00:53.470
Bad too, right?

00:53.554 --> 00:56.056
Horrible. Now I need
some horrible milk to go with it.

00:58.934 --> 00:59.935
No.

01:05.691 --> 01:10.237
Yo, Crys, I know you saw Lester's repost.
My views are over 100K.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.449
This is what it's like
to officially be on the come-up.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.909
Man, we out here.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.787
Are you even listening?

01:19.997 --> 01:22.583
A hundred thousand views. Congratulations.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.752
Don't worry, I'ma be reposting you too.
Get your numbers up.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.881
I don't need you to do anything for me.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.884
Are you seriously jealous right now?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.678
That's it. I'm jealous.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.764
Matter of fact,
the whole world is jealous of Jace Carson.

01:37.848 --> 01:41.476
The whole world said I sucked,
and I'm overrated. Remember that?

01:42.728 --> 01:43.979
I remember.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.857
DMV's got me back to number one
with that Mendez kid.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.109
And I'm finally getting some love.

01:49.193 --> 01:52.112
If anyone could understand,
I thought that would be you.

01:52.196 --> 01:56.074
And if I was able to talk to someone,
I thought it'd be you.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.451
Talk about what?

02:00.662 --> 02:01.622
Talk about what?

02:03.498 --> 02:04.917
I thought something was wrong…

02:08.086 --> 02:09.295
but I made a mistake.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.634
So, you're angry at me

02:13.717 --> 02:16.512
because you made a mistake
we never talked about?

02:18.096 --> 02:19.139
Forget about it, bro.

03:42.598 --> 03:48.312
I see you into overpriced organic shit.
Got your quinoa, coconut water.

03:48.395 --> 03:52.357
What's this? Ginger root?
Icon trying to keep his sexy up?

03:52.441 --> 03:54.776
My sexy stay up. What's good, Lil' Pip?

03:54.860 --> 03:56.528
-What's goin' on, big dog?
-All good.

03:56.612 --> 04:00.157
Me and the lady, we expectin'.
So, you know, gotta do the healthy thing.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.492
Y'all 'bout to have
a little Icon Junior running around?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.286
We having a little girl.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.705
Hey, ain't no gender lock
on greatness, brother.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.874
-I know that. No doubt.
-Yeah.

04:08.957 --> 04:13.086
But I hear your team doesn't suck
as bad as it normally does.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.171
Come on.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.757
Ready for your annual tradition
of getting whacked by my G-Dub mafia?

04:18.509 --> 04:20.594
Yeah, we do got y'all
on the schedule comin' up.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.846
Yeah. You know you do, man.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.724
And I don't wanna hear
your soft Swagger boys

04:25.807 --> 04:28.101
bitching and crying
to the refs all night either.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.188
We don't play dirty, and we ain't soft.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.733
But on the real, Jace Carson?
That was a nice pickup.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.027
He most definitely gon' get your paper up.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.280
I tried to holler at his mom
'bout him playing for G-Dub.

04:40.364 --> 04:43.992
Been a different story if I had
a sponsorship when I talked to her.

04:44.076 --> 04:47.704
Y'all got a sneaker deal?
So, what? Skechers? Or what's good?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.289
Jokes, man.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.000
Nah, it ain't official yet,
but Lester Davis?

04:52.084 --> 04:53.669
He's showin' interest, man.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.587
You know the dude.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.257
Think you could put in
a good word for me, good brother?

04:58.757 --> 05:03.011
My good word?
Stay clear of that situation. For real.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.806
Man, so what? He givin' you all that help.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.683
-What help?
-All that free advertising.

05:07.766 --> 05:11.687
He blowin' up Jace Carson
on IG and all that.

05:11.770 --> 05:15.482
You tryin' to keep all the blessings
to yourself, Icon?

05:16.942 --> 05:18.318
I don't go by that no more.

05:20.487 --> 05:24.032
I forgot how touchy
you Seat Pleasant boys can be.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.704
Okay, Isaac.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.916
Guess I'll see you at the beatdown.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.173
Okay. It's time.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.800
Coach Bobby,
I don't know how to thank you.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.261
No need. Really.
I feel lucky to be around him.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.846
He's a great young man.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.891
But hey, before I forget,
I need you to sign the guardian papers.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.559
¿Cómo?

05:51.143 --> 05:52.144
Guardian papers?

05:52.227 --> 05:55.189
Yeah. Here, take a look.
It's all pretty standard stuff.

06:00.903 --> 06:03.780
Allows us to save a lot of time
if something pops up.

06:05.657 --> 06:09.203
Look, I can assure you everything
that's in here is in his best interest.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.164
You introduced him to a sneaker guy
who likes your team?

06:12.247 --> 06:14.875
I did. Gladiator Sneakers
might sponsor us.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.336
And how does that work, actually?

06:17.419 --> 06:20.339
If the deal closes,
and I'm confident that it will,

06:20.422 --> 06:21.882
we'll be getting a lot of gear.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.093
And travel expenses to tournaments.
And exposure.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.304
It means a lot of opportunity for your son
down the line.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.476
-For my son?
-Yeah. And the whole team.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.312
But for him to be able to play
in those tournaments,

06:35.395 --> 06:36.855
I need to be able to sign consent.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.111
But if you let me know ahead of time,

06:43.195 --> 06:45.405
I could sign a consent
and send it back to you.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.491
Teresa, it's a lot more than tournaments.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.745
For him to play at a school
like Saint Augustus the next fall,

06:51.828 --> 06:53.914
I can't make that happen
without guardianship.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.666
But I am his mother.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.669
Of course. But I don't have time
to track you down in Puerto Rico

06:58.752 --> 07:00.212
every time something comes up.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.840
It doesn't work that way.

07:03.715 --> 07:07.302
But you had no problem tracking me down
when you wanted my son to go play for you.

07:07.386 --> 07:10.806
Is that why you flew me here?
So that I could sign over guardianship?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.726
I'm going to try to forget
you asked me that, Teresa.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.229
Guardianship would allow you
to make all the decisions.

07:17.312 --> 07:21.024
You wouldn't have to talk to me, right?
You would control what team he plays for.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.234
You would control his future.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.237
Look, honestly,
with everything that I'm doing for him,

07:26.613 --> 07:29.199
his future will be a lot brighter
if I'm in the mix.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.577
You should try thanking me.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.246
Nicolás!

07:37.207 --> 07:39.168
-Mom-- Mami.
-No. Nicolás!

07:39.251 --> 07:40.878
-Mami.
-Teresa. Nick.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.839
Okay, Teresa. Listen. Hey.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.551
Let's calm down, okay?
You are about to make a foolish mistake.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.596
I may not be calm, but I am not foolish.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.805
Come on.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.849
And you stay the hell away from my son.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.233
-I'll be back to pick you up.
-All right.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.531
Hey. Give 'em hell.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.824
I will, Dad.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.707
-Yo, Phil.
-What's up?

08:22.169 --> 08:26.006
Yo. We had some words after last game.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.509
Does that mean
I gotta run laps or something?

08:28.592 --> 08:30.219
No. Look.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.139
I shouldn't have brought you
to Lester's house in the first place.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.265
Why not?

08:35.974 --> 08:39.019
He's a distraction,
and I want you focused.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.729
Meeting him made me more focused.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.856
Lester said the best of the best
are consistent.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.984
We got two dubs in a row,
so let's get a third.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.112
Florida, right, Coach?

08:51.406 --> 08:52.908
All right. Let's get it.

08:52.991 --> 08:53.992
Let's get it.

08:57.371 --> 09:00.374
Pound, pound, wall.
Pound, pound, pass.

09:03.627 --> 09:08.423
G-Dub Hoops are physical.
Strong. But we are stronger.

09:14.847 --> 09:15.848
Jace!

09:16.890 --> 09:18.016
Where's the focus?

09:20.477 --> 09:21.687
Stay focused.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.022
Come on, y'all. Tighten up. Tighten up.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.733
Get ready. Finish strong.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.070
Pound, pound, wall. Pound, pound, pass.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.376
They got us tied for number one.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.460
Yeah, not for long.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.421
Why you here?

09:48.672 --> 09:51.884
My moms must be trying to find out
how much your coach paid for that ranking.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.303
-I pay on the court, bro.
-The game I dropped 40 on you?

09:54.386 --> 09:56.555
We'll see what happens next time.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.806
You already know.

10:00.893 --> 10:01.894
You don't want it.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.563
I want all the smoke.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.357
Exactly what kind of help
are you looking for?

10:08.192 --> 10:10.277
I took my son off the Dominion Ballers.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.070
That's a decent program.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.572
We're living in Puerto Rico.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.784
Coach Bobby recruited Nicolás,
let him stay with him and his family.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.662
Now he insists
that I sign over guardianship.

10:20.746 --> 10:23.540
-I'm not doing that.
-I don't blame you.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.250
How did you get hooked up with Bobby?

10:26.001 --> 10:29.421
He saw a video of Nicolás playing ball,
contacted his coach on the island.

10:29.505 --> 10:33.300
Everybody said this area
is the basketball mecca.

10:34.009 --> 10:39.348
And so when the invitation came,
we decided to go for it. But now…

10:42.017 --> 10:44.228
If I can't find a team
willing to take my son,

10:44.311 --> 10:45.729
we'll have to go home.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.440
-Willing to take him or put him up?
-Both.

10:52.528 --> 10:53.779
What does he want to do?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.532
He wants to stay.

10:57.741 --> 11:01.245
Nicolás feels like this is the only place
he can realize his dreams.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.496
He belongs here.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.835
But I will have to stay.
I am not leaving my son alone again.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.922
I assume that we're not the only team
you're speaking with.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.966
No. But you are the first.

11:15.634 --> 11:16.969
You realize what you're asking?

11:17.052 --> 11:19.263
There's nothing criminal
or illegal going on here.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.431
It's a moderate request for a good family.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.433
You're asking me to graduate

11:23.517 --> 11:25.853
from buying uniforms
and covering tournament fees

11:25.936 --> 11:28.689
to sponsoring a family from Puerto Rico.
That's moderate?

11:29.731 --> 11:31.233
Uniforms and tournament fees?

11:31.733 --> 11:33.402
He's an angel investor. That's all.

11:33.861 --> 11:37.531
Look, I might be able
to set them up in corporate housing.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.617
Perhaps put the mom on someone's desk.

11:41.285 --> 11:45.581
But as long as you got my boy
shaking a tin cup for playing time,

11:45.664 --> 11:47.374
I'm not guaranteeing a damn thing.

11:47.958 --> 11:51.545
Well, I don't really give a kid minutes
based off their father's pockets.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.630
Okay, look, hold on.

11:54.256 --> 11:58.093
Nick Mendez takes our team
from being a good team to a super team.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.430
Okay? I mean,
think about Royale being in that mix.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.015
And also instant egos.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.434
Which is the benefit
of having a great coach like you.

12:06.185 --> 12:07.352
I hate that term.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.771
-"Super team."
-So do I.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.190
What do you prefer?

12:12.149 --> 12:15.110
A strong starting five
that includes my son.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.363
At least I know why Royale was
your protected pick.

12:19.823 --> 12:23.577
Here's a term I hope you both like.
Life is too short to be shady.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.752
That's a lot of drama
to assemble a good team.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.213
You stick at this long enough.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.381
I mean, you'd be lucky
to land a kid like Jace.

12:36.465 --> 12:39.259
But to have
two high-level players on one team?

12:39.843 --> 12:40.844
Changes everything.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.014
See what you can do, Brett.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.098
I'm gonna talk to Ike.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.490
Done before sunrise?

13:02.074 --> 13:04.284
I'm out here
setting new records this morning.

13:04.743 --> 13:08.539
Here's a towel for you, son.
Please use it before you get in my car.

13:12.835 --> 13:17.047
I forgot to tell you.
Nick Mendez came at the end of practice.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.007
For what?

13:19.091 --> 13:20.300
I don't know.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.304
His mom was talking to Coach and Meg.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.870
The end of the world is upon us!

13:49.162 --> 13:50.581
You will ask to be saved,

13:51.373 --> 13:54.501
but are you unwilling to be
your brother and sister's keeper?

13:54.585 --> 13:56.295
They crucified my Lord.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.922
They said Harriet was a fugitive.
The end of the world…

13:59.006 --> 14:00.883
Apocalypse Anne is
at it early this morning.

14:02.217 --> 14:06.054
Nine dollars of superfood.
You better lick that glass clean.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.682
There's some left, Jackie.
You wanna kill it?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.100
You're joking, right?

14:10.684 --> 14:12.853
She just afraid
it's gonna put hair on her chest.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.356
It's definitely not putting any hair
on that bony little chest of yours.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.318
You should hit them push-ups harder.

14:20.694 --> 14:25.282
All right, I see what y'all got going on.
Little Black girl magic thing.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.242
-Very nice. Well done.
-Very nice.

14:29.828 --> 14:34.166
Hey, Mom.
Lester Davis DMed me this morning.

14:34.249 --> 14:37.711
Says I can go train with him,
but it's at the same time as practice.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.962
I'll call Ike.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.548
Wait. So, I can go?

14:41.632 --> 14:44.551
Of course.
You can't miss an opportunity like that.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.054
It's over.

14:47.137 --> 14:50.516
You and Lester still getting mad love
on the IG?

14:50.599 --> 14:51.975
Please don't say "mad love."

14:52.059 --> 14:55.270
I'd really be killing it if I got a pic
next to that blacked-out Lambo.

14:55.354 --> 14:56.647
Why didn't you?

14:57.689 --> 14:59.149
Him and Coach have some static.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.610
What kind of static?

15:01.693 --> 15:07.074
I don't know. One minute they was talking,
then Ike got mad, and we bounced.

15:09.701 --> 15:13.288
Hey. Do y'all think I'm selfish?

15:13.872 --> 15:14.957
Wait, no, no, no.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.669
How is that even a serious question,
Mr. Won't-Wash-A-Dish

15:18.752 --> 15:21.755
Toothpaste-In-The-Sink
Who-Loves-To-Leave-The-Toilet-Seat-Up?

15:21.839 --> 15:24.758
Again with the toilet seat.
Do you not look before you sit down?

15:24.842 --> 15:26.510
Is this basketball-related?

15:26.593 --> 15:27.719
Yes.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.513
Then you already know my response.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.766
-Not selfish enough.
-"Not selfish enough." I know.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.518
All right, I'm gonna leave early

15:34.601 --> 15:38.355
so I can have a longer lunch break
for my deliveries. I'll see y'all.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.607
And Jace, about the toilet seat.

15:40.691 --> 15:43.443
Like your jumpers,
you need to be working on your aim.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.193
Hello.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.115
-Melony. Your order came in.
-Hey, girl.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.117
Thank you. That was fast.

16:32.201 --> 16:35.329
Well, I don't waste no time.
I give FedEx a run for their money.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.164
You do. And it's my color too.

16:38.207 --> 16:42.836
Jenna-Jen. You got extra beauty samples
for some of the ugly brothers up in here?

16:43.337 --> 16:46.423
No, but I got a swift butt kick
coming your way.

16:46.507 --> 16:49.343
Did you really cut a swoosh
up in my son's head?

16:50.302 --> 16:53.055
Okay, look.
Your boy come up in here peacocking,

16:53.138 --> 16:55.682
talking 'bout,
"Mr. Sawyer, my mom won't mind."

16:55.766 --> 16:59.561
In retrospect, wrong decision.
You forgive me?

17:01.355 --> 17:02.481
Next cut on you?

17:03.065 --> 17:04.191
Deal.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.277
Jace is a real good kid, though.
Real good.

17:07.361 --> 17:09.655
-I love what you're doing with him.
-Thank you.

17:10.948 --> 17:14.409
Sawyer, let me ask you something.
What about Ike, his coach?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.744
-What do you think about him?
-The Icon?

17:16.828 --> 17:20.332
One of DMV's finest. He's up on the wall.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.377
Only the best gets up on my Wall of Fame.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.256
Jace'll be up there, one of these days.

17:27.339 --> 17:31.510
The '08 Seat Pleasant High School team.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.054
They went to State twice.
Won the first time.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.558
Icon, Lester Davis, and Ron Young.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.810
Boy, those boys could go.

17:39.893 --> 17:43.647
Ike and Lester have any issues
with one another?

17:44.481 --> 17:47.234
I don't know about anything
between Ike and Lester,

17:47.317 --> 17:49.695
but Ike had a few issues with his pops.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.155
Right after the last state tournament.

17:53.407 --> 17:54.783
It was sad.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.536
They were real close. Real close.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.329
Then Charlie passed away.

18:01.290 --> 18:04.334
Ike--
His game was never the same after that.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.796
Never quite reached
that Icon status again.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.548
But he's a good man.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.263
What about Lester Davis?

18:18.515 --> 18:19.975
Solid as they come.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.315
Watch him! Switch!

18:27.482 --> 18:28.609
Let's see it.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.485
I got it! I got it!

18:30.569 --> 18:32.529
-Right here! Cut! Cut!
-Where's Jace?

18:32.613 --> 18:35.824
Jenna left a voice mail.
Said he couldn't make it.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.870
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

18:39.953 --> 18:40.954
There you go!

18:41.038 --> 18:42.414
I'll look into it.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.459
I'm over here!

18:45.542 --> 18:46.585
Come on, finish that.

18:47.753 --> 18:50.297
Okay, Royale! I see you!

18:55.219 --> 18:56.845
Yo, check this out.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.017
-What?
-That's crazy.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.770
Bro, I can't believe
this dude skipped on practice, bro.

19:04.853 --> 19:05.938
What's going on?

19:10.567 --> 19:11.735
Dirty.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.904
-Hey, I appreciate you, man.
-You got it, bro.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.114
-Okay.
-Thank you.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.451
Hey, remember to keep working
on your range.

19:19.535 --> 19:22.079
Add a three to your game
with some consistency, sky's the limit.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.539
-I'm serious.
-Thanks.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.874
-Good to meet you, Jenna.
-You too.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.252
-So what's up? I'll cook you right now.
-That's what's up.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.878
-We gotta go, Jace.
-I'll cook--

19:30.462 --> 19:33.298
But Mom, Lester said he was
gonna give me a ride in the Lambo.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.133
Don't put the man on the spot like that.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.178
Nah. It's cool. Jace says he wants
to go to Eddie Wang's Carryout.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.930
That used to be my spot, so…

19:40.013 --> 19:41.014
Driving or speeding?

19:41.098 --> 19:43.475
Nothin' over the speed limit, Moms.
I promise you.

19:46.937 --> 19:47.938
Okay.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.106
-Yes!
-Okay.

19:49.189 --> 19:53.110
-Check up right now. I want the NBA smoke.
-What's up? You want the heat?

20:03.161 --> 20:05.914
I don't know if Ike told you,
but I offered to sponsor the team,

20:05.998 --> 20:06.999
and he turned me down.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.501
-Why?
-I don't know.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.671
Maybe 'cause he resents
how well I've done.

20:13.589 --> 20:16.675
It's almost like he's trying to keep you
from making it too.

20:16.758 --> 20:20.387
The brother can be petty.
You know that, right?

20:23.891 --> 20:26.018
Man, it's all good.
You ain't gotta say nothing.

20:26.727 --> 20:29.313
But anyway, I'm sponsoring the G-Dubs.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.566
-That's who we play next weekend.
-I know, I know.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.194
We won't let that come between us, man.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.405
I'm rooting for my team,
but I'm also rooting for you, young king.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.742
And when you're ready,
we got a jersey with your name on it.

20:41.825 --> 20:45.579
G-Dubs make it to nationals every year.
Every year.

20:46.914 --> 20:49.583
-Thanks for the ride, Lester. It was fire.
-It's all good.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.475
Check out that car, bro.

21:08.977 --> 21:09.978
Come on, bro.

21:13.774 --> 21:16.068
This color would look good on her.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.278
-Here.
-Helps with the redness…

21:18.362 --> 21:19.363
-Okay.
-Hold on.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.989
-…and the discoloration.
-I understand.

21:22.199 --> 21:24.159
-Hi, Ike.
-Hey.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.747
I tried calling.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.582
Yeah, and I didn't pick up, Coach.

21:30.666 --> 21:33.210
I'm a little busy,
and Jace isn't at home right now.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.337
I was just coming to check in.

21:35.420 --> 21:38.715
About what?
You got something to tell me about Mendez?

21:39.883 --> 21:42.719
Mendez? Nothing there to tell.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.430
But I saw a video,

21:45.514 --> 21:49.268
and Jace skipped practice
to train with Lester.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.687
It was a rare opportunity.
I told you about it.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.438
You left a voice mail.

21:54.022 --> 21:58.902
Look, Jenna…
I think basketball can teach life lessons.

21:58.986 --> 21:59.987
Really?

22:00.904 --> 22:04.324
Accountability. Reliability.

22:04.408 --> 22:08.495
Look. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings
for not speaking to you directly.

22:08.579 --> 22:11.790
How 'bout you leave the life lessons
to me, and you handle basketball?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.751
-I didn't mean--
-I'm sure you didn't.

22:15.919 --> 22:18.505
Are there any other basketball concerns?

22:18.589 --> 22:20.048
The morning runs.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.384
I'm listening.

22:23.218 --> 22:24.386
Maybe you could cut back.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.516
It's a lot of strain on a young body.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.643
You're on a roll. Don't stop now.

22:32.561 --> 22:34.271
-That's it.
-You sure?

22:37.107 --> 22:42.070
Maybe sometimes
my wife can come see your cosmetics?

22:44.281 --> 22:47.993
You know what? This is for her.

22:48.785 --> 22:51.205
This is not necessary.

22:51.288 --> 22:52.331
I insist.

22:55.292 --> 22:56.543
Thank you.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.670
You're welcome.

23:00.881 --> 23:02.216
-And--
-Well, goodbye.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.552
You ready?

23:08.639 --> 23:12.809
You sure you not too busy, Mr. Carson?
I mean, you big ballin' now.

23:12.893 --> 23:14.978
You pulled up to a carryout in a Lambo.

23:16.855 --> 23:19.316
I guess times have changed.
For some of us.

23:20.901 --> 23:24.029
So y'all gonna stay salty
about that Dominion Ballers game?

23:24.821 --> 23:26.365
I took over to get us all the dub.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.991
Nah, you took over to get your clout up.

23:28.075 --> 23:32.246
And you wanted to show off for a girl.
So don't give me that team ball bullshit.

23:32.329 --> 23:33.455
At least I know how to pass.

23:33.539 --> 23:36.708
Yo, we all agreed to have Musa's back,
and you bailed on us, bro.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.710
-He did.
-Just like you bailed on practice.

23:38.794 --> 23:41.588
No, if I wanted to bail on you,
I wouldn't still be here, aight?

23:41.672 --> 23:43.006
My bad on practice,

23:43.090 --> 23:45.717
but I'm not apologizing
for ballin' out last game.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.096
But which one of y'all did
that J.Amnesia post?

23:49.930 --> 23:51.932
-What post?
-Says I forgot how to pass.

23:52.015 --> 23:54.268
I want y'all to take it down.

23:54.351 --> 23:55.769
Drew, you know about a post?

23:56.895 --> 23:58.397
-You know anything, Royale?
-Nope.

24:00.691 --> 24:02.943
All right, look. We got two wins.

24:03.026 --> 24:06.196
If we get a third in a row,
we're off to a really good start.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.157
But Lester Davis is
sponsoring the G-Dubs now.

24:09.241 --> 24:10.534
You know what that means?

24:10.617 --> 24:14.413
It's gonna be crazy cameras and press.
So let's show up.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.417
All right, yeah, yo.
Let's show up, right?

24:18.500 --> 24:21.128
So Jace Carson can show out
for all the cameras and press.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.462
Yeah.

24:22.546 --> 24:24.173
Wait, nah, I didn't mean it like that.

24:24.590 --> 24:27.259
Let's go, y'all. Let's go.

24:27.342 --> 24:30.679
Where y'all going? Serious?

24:32.055 --> 24:34.224
Lester says Jace is the future.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.897
That's unnecessary pressure
to put on a kid.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.733
All right, that's enough.
Can I have my phone?

24:43.317 --> 24:46.195
And aren't you the man who thinks
that social media is bullshit?

24:47.571 --> 24:50.908
Yeah, but the problem is
Jace doesn't think that way.

24:51.950 --> 24:54.119
Are you telling me that if you were 14,

24:54.203 --> 24:57.581
and an NBA player invited you
for a workout, you wouldn't go?

24:57.664 --> 24:59.166
I sure the hell would.

24:59.249 --> 25:00.834
Exactly. Thank you, Brother Naim.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.463
He shouldn't be missing practice.
That's all I'm saying.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.673
He lets the team down
when he pulls stunts like that.

25:06.757 --> 25:09.092
And I agree with you, babe. Okay?

25:09.176 --> 25:12.471
His mama can give me all the makeup
in the world, and it doesn't matter.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.640
Jace is not too young
for responsibility, but…

25:15.224 --> 25:16.391
Here it goes.

25:17.935 --> 25:19.853
…he's a kid in a grown man's body.

25:20.437 --> 25:23.148
There are plenty of people
just waiting for him to mess up.

25:24.149 --> 25:27.402
Just give him a minute.
He'll see that you're there for him.

25:33.367 --> 25:34.368
She's not wrong.

25:34.451 --> 25:37.454
She never is. I kinda hate that.

25:39.122 --> 25:42.459
Yeah, well,
your work wife makes sense too.

25:43.544 --> 25:45.087
Meg? Are you serious?

25:45.170 --> 25:46.964
Hey, we get Nick Mendez,

25:47.047 --> 25:49.007
we have two of the best players
in the DMV.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.095
So you don't have a problem

25:53.178 --> 25:56.390
with Meg asking a team parent
to cut the check for the kid?

25:56.473 --> 25:59.184
Given his situation? Hell no!

25:59.268 --> 26:00.853
It's less corrupt than college ball.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.313
Look, these schools,

26:03.397 --> 26:05.816
they'll drop an armored truck full of cash
on a coach.

26:05.899 --> 26:08.944
But let these ballplayers take
a stick of gum, and they're in violation.

26:09.653 --> 26:11.321
They're making moves to change that.

26:11.405 --> 26:13.949
All right,
so then let's not be behind the times.

26:14.032 --> 26:17.160
Now, Nick Mendez,
he got that dog in him.

26:17.953 --> 26:20.747
-Come on, man. That's your answer?
-Yep.

26:20.831 --> 26:23.208
My pops was gettin' offered
fancy cars and shit

26:23.292 --> 26:26.211
for me and Lester
to play for this team or that school.

26:26.295 --> 26:28.463
-Yeah.
-There's too much shady shit in the game.

26:28.547 --> 26:32.050
Your pops did roll around
in that old-ass Plymouth.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.635
With pride.

26:37.222 --> 26:40.809
He did, though.
I miss that grumpy-ass man.

26:43.729 --> 26:45.272
He'd be proud of you.

26:45.898 --> 26:48.066
You're not just building ballplayers.

26:49.151 --> 26:50.986
You're building young men.

26:51.570 --> 26:53.155
Just like your pops talked about.

26:54.156 --> 26:55.157
But you know what?

26:56.533 --> 26:59.244
I think it's time
for you to bring the Icon back.

27:00.829 --> 27:01.830
What you saying?

27:03.624 --> 27:07.336
I'm saying shake up the world, man.
One more time.

27:08.587 --> 27:11.173
Look, we get these two players,

27:11.256 --> 27:14.676
and I'm telling you
we'll have the DMV on lock.

27:16.094 --> 27:17.763
Real talk?

27:17.846 --> 27:21.141
I don't know if there's enough room
on the court for Nick and Jace's ego.

27:22.351 --> 27:24.853
And let's not even talk
of how Jenna Carson'll flip

27:24.937 --> 27:26.563
if Jace gotta share more ball.

27:27.648 --> 27:28.857
But I do know this.

27:30.484 --> 27:33.862
Nick Mendez? He got that dog in him.

27:35.197 --> 27:36.281
Stop doing that.

27:47.918 --> 27:49.002
Hey, you busy?

27:49.086 --> 27:51.129
-Depends.
-Okay. Where were we?

27:51.213 --> 27:54.591
So everybody made their goal last week…

27:54.675 --> 27:58.971
-I… wrote a letter to our father.
-…but I think we can do better.

28:01.306 --> 28:02.307
What?

28:02.933 --> 28:07.521
I was gonna send it to his work address,
and I think you should write one too.

28:09.147 --> 28:10.148
And say what?

28:11.984 --> 28:13.443
You can tell him about yourself

28:13.527 --> 28:15.904
and how not hearing from him
makes you feel.

28:19.116 --> 28:20.993
Or you could tell him about basketball.

28:22.411 --> 28:23.412
Oh, I get it.

28:24.830 --> 28:28.458
Like, how an NBA player
cares more about me than he ever did.

28:30.169 --> 28:32.671
Like how Lester is willing
to help me with my game

28:32.754 --> 28:34.131
so I can reach my dreams

28:34.214 --> 28:36.925
because my own pops is too caught up
with his own shit.

28:41.013 --> 28:41.889
I'm good.

28:46.310 --> 28:47.311
Okay.

28:51.148 --> 28:52.149
Hey, Jack. Hold up.

28:52.232 --> 28:55.360
Yes. You wanna-- Yes.
You wanna put it on really lightly.

28:55.444 --> 28:58.071
-Do you know how to make brownies?
-Yeah.

28:59.198 --> 29:00.199
Vegan ones?

29:00.282 --> 29:02.451
I mean, I could figure it out.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.413
Can you make some for me?

29:06.496 --> 29:07.956
Okay, but since when are you a--

29:09.541 --> 29:11.376
Wait, wait, wait.

29:11.460 --> 29:15.130
Isn't Crystal a vegan? Yes. Yes, she is.

29:15.214 --> 29:17.966
-No, she's like my sister.
-So, what-- what?

29:18.050 --> 29:21.178
Oh, really? So, then,
what are you gonna make me?

29:21.261 --> 29:26.099
Nothing. Look.
She's going through a tough time now,

29:26.183 --> 29:28.602
and I really need you to help me out.

29:31.730 --> 29:36.401
Okay. But if you wanna
make brownies for her,

29:36.485 --> 29:39.530
then a good first step is
not trying to get me to make 'em.

29:40.489 --> 29:41.490
Done.

29:42.908 --> 29:44.284
Yo, we still hittin' the carryout?

29:44.368 --> 29:46.453
Hell yeah,
I'm about to kill me some wangs.

29:46.537 --> 29:48.914
"Wangs"? Simone, you so 'bama.

29:48.997 --> 29:52.417
I know you did not just call me 'bama
with them big old corns on your feet.

29:52.501 --> 29:54.503
I do not have corns.

29:54.586 --> 29:58.006
Crystal. Crystal, please tell your girl
about her ugly feet. Like…

29:58.090 --> 30:01.426
No cap though?
Your feet are kinda jacked up.

30:01.510 --> 30:06.056
Like, you've been kickin' on bricks
all day, and they jacked up. Like, 24/7.

30:06.139 --> 30:07.808
-Thank you.
-Show me your feet. Show--

30:07.891 --> 30:10.018
Hey there, Crystal.
Can I see you a minute?

30:11.645 --> 30:13.355
You want us to wait on you?

30:13.438 --> 30:14.439
She'll catch up.

30:17.776 --> 30:18.986
Save me some wangs.

30:55.105 --> 30:57.733
Gladiator sneakers will be donating
to the Dominion Ballers

30:57.816 --> 30:59.443
$25,000 in gear and apparel,

30:59.526 --> 31:03.739
which must be worn by you and your team
at all basketball-related events.

31:03.822 --> 31:08.702
And then we will give you
an additional $75,000

31:08.785 --> 31:11.413
for team expenses and core necessities.

31:16.585 --> 31:19.963
Listen, Alonzo, this all sounds great.

31:20.047 --> 31:21.924
Hey, man, come on. We're excited.

31:22.007 --> 31:25.177
You know what actually put you guys over?
That last game.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.429
Watching Nick Mendez
give Jace Carson the business.

31:29.515 --> 31:30.599
Boy is box office.

31:33.185 --> 31:36.855
Coach, your program just went from

31:36.939 --> 31:40.526
a nice place to pass through
to a full-blown destination.

31:48.116 --> 31:50.911
-Couldn't be more excited, brother.
-My man.

31:53.956 --> 31:54.957
Yeah.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.751
Get that, Drew!

31:57.835 --> 31:58.836
Yeah!

31:59.837 --> 32:01.797
Yo! We need gear like that, bro.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.633
They got that court drip.

32:09.012 --> 32:12.558
Yeah! Yeah! All right, all right! Yeah!

32:17.604 --> 32:20.065
Swagger's on. What's up, young king?
How you feeling?

32:20.482 --> 32:21.483
Hype.

32:21.567 --> 32:24.486
For sure, I'm rootin' for you.
I can't say the same for your teammates.

32:25.237 --> 32:27.406
-Make us proud, aight?
-No doubt.

32:27.489 --> 32:28.740
Aight, for the city.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.246
This place is a circus.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.125
And there goes the clown.

32:40.043 --> 32:42.963
G-Dub. D-Dub.

32:43.046 --> 32:44.506
Welcome to today's game,

32:44.590 --> 32:46.842
featuring Swagger DMV

32:46.925 --> 32:52.639
versus our very own
Lester Davis's G-Dubs Hoops Squad!

32:52.723 --> 32:55.350
Thanks to the giving spirit of Lester,

32:55.434 --> 32:59.104
we are proud to unveil what this gym
has been begging for for years.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.865
Let's give it up for Lester Davis!

33:17.289 --> 33:21.502
Real quick. Shout-out to the Southeast!
I love y'all with everything!

33:22.002 --> 33:25.881
Yeah! I also want to give
a big ups and a shout-out

33:25.964 --> 33:27.966
to my old high school teammates
over there.

33:30.010 --> 33:33.430
Naim Rahaim!
He was a senior our freshman year.

33:34.223 --> 33:36.016
And I always looked up to you, bro.

33:36.099 --> 33:42.105
And the head coach of Swagger.
Isaac Kennedy Edwards AKA Icon!

33:45.400 --> 33:47.569
This dude used to be the truth, man.

33:48.987 --> 33:50.989
Too bad he's about
to catch this fade today.

33:54.451 --> 33:57.204
Come on up here, man. Let's get this pic.

34:09.675 --> 34:12.844
Too good for my sponsorship?
The kids could've used my money.

34:12.928 --> 34:15.264
All this bullshit
just because we had a falling-out?

34:15.848 --> 34:18.516
Annihilate the competition.
Your old man taught us that.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.268
I gave you a chance to apologize.

34:20.351 --> 34:23.938
Our business is our business.
Just leave Jace out of it.

34:24.022 --> 34:27.609
-You afraid I'm gonna steal him from you?
-You don't give a shit about him.

34:27.693 --> 34:31.280
Of course, I do.
A good kid like that is good for my image.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.864
Wait until I get him on my team.

34:32.947 --> 34:37.452
I'm not gonna let you mess with his head
so you can play games. He's hands-off.

34:38.286 --> 34:40.914
Or what? You wanna settle this outside?

34:41.665 --> 34:42.958
Let's go then.

34:43.542 --> 34:45.377
I think I'm good, Isaac.

34:45.460 --> 34:49.297
You see, 'cause unlike you,
I actually got something to lose.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.300
-God bless. Yeah, you too, man.
-Good game.

34:53.552 --> 34:57.014
Let's show 'em, baby! Yeah!
That's why we here! That's why we here!

34:58.765 --> 35:00.642
Let's go! Let's go!

35:00.726 --> 35:01.852
We got this! Come on!

35:03.478 --> 35:05.814
All right, fellas. Feel it!
Go! Come on! We got you!

35:07.107 --> 35:08.233
I see you!

35:14.323 --> 35:15.324
Yo, ref!

35:27.669 --> 35:30.672
Go, boy. Post!
That's what I'm talkin' about! Go, Swan!

35:30.756 --> 35:32.799
You're not gonna call that?
You didn't see that?

35:32.883 --> 35:34.301
Spread out! Spread out!

35:41.266 --> 35:43.602
Foul! Twenty-five! Push!

35:43.685 --> 35:44.686
Yes! Yes!

36:05.040 --> 36:07.668
You gonna call that play?
There's a foul on the court!

36:07.751 --> 36:08.752
Stop!

36:20.013 --> 36:21.014
That's not a foul.

36:21.098 --> 36:22.724
Ref, come on. What is that?

36:22.808 --> 36:24.268
-It's a foul.
-That's all ball.

36:24.351 --> 36:26.562
Don't worry about him, Ref. Good call.

36:28.647 --> 36:29.606
Ball don't lie!

36:31.358 --> 36:32.401
Good job, Jace!

37:01.722 --> 37:03.557
So, what?

37:06.768 --> 37:10.564
Y'all thought I was joking?
I told y'all they were comin' to play.

37:11.190 --> 37:12.691
No, they keep fouling us, Coach.

37:12.774 --> 37:15.152
So, let 'em foul! Fight through it!

37:15.652 --> 37:18.155
All y'all! Fight through it!

37:18.238 --> 37:20.532
I hate to say it,
but y'all playing scared.

37:20.616 --> 37:22.784
Y'all gotta man up. For real.

37:22.868 --> 37:27.789
Jace, you got four fouls.
I need you. All right? Slow it up.

37:29.291 --> 37:33.378
Musa, I guarantee they gonna double Jace.

37:34.421 --> 37:38.967
When they do, you got the numbers.
Drive, or kick it to these shooters.

37:39.051 --> 37:40.594
Or pass me the rock!

37:40.677 --> 37:42.012
Not if you doubled, bruh.

37:42.721 --> 37:44.223
I don't care if I'm doubled.

37:44.306 --> 37:45.974
-You don't care.
-Pass me the ball.

37:46.058 --> 37:47.768
-Yo, yo, chill!
-I know what to do with it!

37:47.851 --> 37:49.228
-Hey!
-Relax, relax.

37:50.646 --> 37:53.357
Check them egos right now.
It's not helping.

37:55.108 --> 37:56.109
Bring it in!

38:03.283 --> 38:05.869
Don't let them see you
with your head down.

38:05.953 --> 38:09.831
Now let's get out here and let's show up.
Together on three. One! Two! Three!

38:09.915 --> 38:10.916
Together!

38:13.460 --> 38:17.089
You can't beat this team by yourself.
Not this one. All right?

38:23.011 --> 38:24.513
Take over.

38:30.769 --> 38:33.772
That's fine. Yeah.
No, it's halftime. It's everything.

38:34.857 --> 38:35.858
I gotta go.

38:36.692 --> 38:38.610
I hear you like poaching players.

38:39.194 --> 38:41.989
I hear you like
trying to take kids from their mothers.

38:42.573 --> 38:43.782
Know what, little girl?

38:43.866 --> 38:47.160
No, condescending jackass, I don't.
Why don't you tell me?

38:48.036 --> 38:50.163
I talked to Teresa.
I know what you're trying to do.

38:50.247 --> 38:53.542
But I got too much time
and too much money invested into Nick

38:53.625 --> 38:55.627
for you to come play fairy godmother.

38:56.336 --> 38:59.006
Because I have the sneaker contract,
the school pipeline,

38:59.089 --> 39:00.465
and everything else he needs.

39:02.134 --> 39:03.844
They'll come to their senses.

39:06.263 --> 39:07.264
Boys are soft.

39:13.061 --> 39:16.273
Hey! Where you going? Where you going?

39:16.356 --> 39:17.900
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

39:33.040 --> 39:34.208
Help him out!

39:34.291 --> 39:35.584
Yo, get back, get back.

39:37.711 --> 39:39.838
Let's go! Yeah! Yeah!

39:39.922 --> 39:41.798
Let's go! Way to go! Move!

39:43.926 --> 39:45.010
Yes, sir!

39:49.348 --> 39:53.101
That's right! That's right! Let's go!

39:56.438 --> 40:00.108
-Let's go, big man!
-Go, go, go, go! Let's go!

40:04.613 --> 40:07.157
Yo, what the hell is wrong with you, bro?

40:07.241 --> 40:08.909
What the hell is wrong with you?

40:08.992 --> 40:11.161
-Who do you think you are?
-Let go, man.

40:11.245 --> 40:12.579
The hell is that move?

40:15.415 --> 40:16.416
This what you want?

40:16.500 --> 40:19.670
Get your boy some Kleenex!
Good play! Good play!

40:19.753 --> 40:22.172
-What? He clotheslined my point guard!
-Good job!

40:22.256 --> 40:24.716
-That's right!
-Are you serious? Call that both ways!

40:24.800 --> 40:28.720
-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
-What you call that?

40:28.804 --> 40:31.056
-Somebody's paying her.
-You taking it from us!

40:31.139 --> 40:32.891
Yeah, boy! Let's go!

40:32.975 --> 40:34.434
Let's go!

40:34.518 --> 40:38.939
Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Love you, baby!

40:45.654 --> 40:46.905
Everybody, bring it in.

40:48.031 --> 40:49.366
Jace, you fouled out.

40:49.449 --> 40:51.785
-That ain't fair, Coach.
-Look. I know.

40:52.953 --> 40:57.833
Royale, you in. You all right?

40:57.916 --> 40:59.668
Yeah, yeah.

40:59.751 --> 41:01.795
Look, you know why I'm putting you in?

41:02.921 --> 41:05.591
Because of that defense
you showed me in practice.

41:05.674 --> 41:07.593
All right. We're down by eight.

41:07.676 --> 41:10.846
If y'all wanna win this,
we gotta go get it.

41:10.929 --> 41:12.222
And go get it right now.

41:13.140 --> 41:15.017
-Bring it in.
-Let's get it!

41:15.100 --> 41:16.476
Wait. Check it.

41:16.560 --> 41:19.521
Musa, last game was your time to shine.
I'm sorry.

41:20.564 --> 41:22.065
I'm sorry to all y'all.

41:22.149 --> 41:25.777
But y'all time to shine is right now.
You earned this.

41:25.861 --> 41:27.821
-Feel me?
-Yeah.

41:27.905 --> 41:29.823
And after the game,
I'm unfollowing Lester Davis.

41:32.492 --> 41:34.411
All right, y'all, we gotta fight.

41:34.912 --> 41:36.788
Come on. Fight on three. Fight on me.

41:36.872 --> 41:38.582
-One! Two! Three!
-Fight!

41:38.665 --> 41:40.250
-Go!
-Come on!

41:43.086 --> 41:45.672
Hey, make sure y'all keep talking.
Keep talking.

41:46.465 --> 41:49.593
-Play together! D-up!
-Call me.

41:50.302 --> 41:51.386
D-up!

41:56.266 --> 41:58.936
Up! There you go! Get the ball! Stay out!

42:06.777 --> 42:08.111
Let's go, Drew!

42:08.195 --> 42:09.488
That's what I need!

42:15.661 --> 42:16.787
Yeah!

42:16.870 --> 42:17.871
Come on! Go!

42:17.955 --> 42:19.414
Come on! Come on!

42:21.917 --> 42:22.918
Yeah!

42:23.752 --> 42:27.840
All right! Ready? Eyes up! Eyes up!
Look at the clock! Look at the clock!

42:31.093 --> 42:33.011
Meet in that middle. Meet in the middle.

42:34.012 --> 42:37.850
Defense! Defense! Defense!

42:39.643 --> 42:40.853
Come on, Royale!

42:41.478 --> 42:46.316
Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

42:55.826 --> 42:58.537
-Come on! Are you kidding me?
-Come on, man.

43:04.877 --> 43:08.547
Come on. You all right? I got you.
You know I got you, all right? Come on.

43:09.131 --> 43:11.133
Good game. It was a good game, all right?

43:12.259 --> 43:13.385
Good game.

43:15.721 --> 43:18.974
-Good game.
-Good game.

43:19.057 --> 43:22.019
-Hey, keep it up. Good game.
-Good game, bro.

43:32.196 --> 43:34.448
Hey. About that J.Amnesia post?

43:37.492 --> 43:40.746
What? That was you? Nah!

43:40.829 --> 43:42.122
I'm sorry, big dog.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.335
Good game, man.

43:46.418 --> 43:47.920
You scrub!

43:48.462 --> 43:51.298
Well, almost had 'em.

43:51.381 --> 43:52.591
Yeah, almost.

43:53.592 --> 43:56.178
You aight? Need me to call you
an ambulance or something?

43:56.261 --> 43:58.555
'Cause the Icon I know don't like to lose.

43:59.223 --> 44:02.518
Still hate losing.
But we damn sure won the fight.

44:02.601 --> 44:03.894
What do you mean?

44:03.977 --> 44:05.729
Our boys showed us something.

44:05.812 --> 44:08.190
Number one:
Showed that they damn sure ain't soft.

44:08.899 --> 44:11.944
Number two:
They showed they can play unselfishly.

44:12.027 --> 44:13.028
That's real.

44:13.111 --> 44:19.201
Three: If we gon' run the DMV,
we need to make room for a dog.

44:19.284 --> 44:20.661
What about that stuff with your pops?

44:20.744 --> 44:22.746
Pops taught us
to annihilate the competition.

44:22.829 --> 44:26.542
That he did, that he did.
So, I'm just saying, can I…

44:28.126 --> 44:29.378
Go ahead.

44:41.265 --> 44:43.934
I got a B-plus
on my Spanish quiz yesterday.

44:45.435 --> 44:49.022
I only missed, like, three words,
but it was only the conjugation--

44:49.106 --> 44:51.984
You really gonna talk to me
about your quiz right now, Royale?

44:53.360 --> 44:55.028
Really? That's what we're doing?

44:55.779 --> 44:57.447
Just thought you would wanna know.

44:57.948 --> 45:02.160
Fine. Good job on your B-plus.

45:03.704 --> 45:05.539
Now, you wanna tell me why you act like

45:05.622 --> 45:08.292
you never picked up
a damn basketball before in your life?

45:09.334 --> 45:11.545
I just-- I had a bad game, I guess.

45:11.628 --> 45:12.921
You had a bad game?

45:13.881 --> 45:16.008
Son, you keep having bad games.

45:16.925 --> 45:20.053
I mean, you're fumbling the ball.
You won't shoot with confidence.

45:20.137 --> 45:22.848
You're running up and down the court
like you're lost half the time.

45:22.931 --> 45:27.811
Like you're running through a damn maze.
What is going on with you?

45:28.937 --> 45:31.190
-Nothing.
-No, it's something.

45:31.273 --> 45:34.735
I seen you hit that shot
a thousand times, Royale.

45:35.694 --> 45:37.029
A thousand times.

45:37.905 --> 45:41.408
There's only so many opportunities we get
in this life to be great.

45:41.491 --> 45:44.369
To set ourselves apart from everyone else.

45:44.453 --> 45:45.871
And tonight, you blew one.

45:45.954 --> 45:48.790
You don't think I know
I'm letting everybody down all the time?

45:49.416 --> 45:50.876
That I'm letting you down all the time?

45:50.959 --> 45:53.337
No, no, no.
We not playing the victim card.

45:53.921 --> 45:55.130
Them boys in that team,

45:55.214 --> 45:59.510
they don't got close to what you got,
and they out there balling out.

45:59.593 --> 46:01.261
I got you playing in the hood

46:01.345 --> 46:03.972
so that you can get out
this soft little bubble you in.

46:04.056 --> 46:06.391
You need grit, Royale. Work harder, man.

46:06.475 --> 46:09.811
I do work hard! You see how hard I work!

46:11.396 --> 46:12.898
I just can't help it, okay?

46:15.442 --> 46:20.864
I don't know if it's me or the dyslexia.
I put in that work.

46:24.284 --> 46:25.369
I'm sorry.

46:27.412 --> 46:30.624
Look, man, I didn't mean
to go in on you like that.

46:31.333 --> 46:32.334
Son…

46:33.043 --> 46:35.170
Okay. Let's…

46:37.673 --> 46:38.674
Let's go home.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.718
What's going on with you and Bobby?

46:41.802 --> 46:44.304
I saw y'all
about to slap box each other earlier.

46:44.388 --> 46:47.641
That man does not wanna see me in a ring.
Trust me.

46:47.724 --> 46:49.184
So, I was thinking.

46:50.561 --> 46:54.314
Of all the people in the world Nick's mom
could've made a connection with…

46:56.441 --> 46:57.776
Shit, she made it with you.

46:59.403 --> 47:01.488
That's why you so good at what you do.

47:02.239 --> 47:06.660
You're a connector.
That's why you're my partner.

47:07.452 --> 47:11.373
Partners.
Doesn't always feel like we're partners.

47:12.165 --> 47:13.750
You didn't bend on the Lester thing.

47:13.834 --> 47:15.544
You made it real hard with Gladiator.

47:16.837 --> 47:20.799
True, but you didn't really
come clean about the whole Royale thing.

47:22.009 --> 47:23.177
Let's press reset.

47:24.136 --> 47:25.137
I'm down with that.

47:27.097 --> 47:30.517
So… Nick. Where does that stand?

47:31.101 --> 47:34.146
Brett says he'll step up.
Put the family up somewhere in the area.

47:34.229 --> 47:35.397
No strings attached.

47:35.480 --> 47:40.319
Okay, well, let him know Royale's minutes
are coach's discretion. Period.

47:41.320 --> 47:42.946
I'll get him to agree to that.

47:45.073 --> 47:46.658
You think Nick is coachable?

47:47.367 --> 47:48.827
Let's find out.

47:50.412 --> 47:51.413
Let's find out.

47:53.540 --> 47:56.460
-Mom, can you let me out here?
-Let you out? Where you going?

47:56.543 --> 47:58.295
I wanna catch the end of Crys's game.

47:58.378 --> 48:02.591
Jace, why did you let the other team
get in your head like that?

48:06.220 --> 48:09.056
And then you almost get into a fight.

48:09.139 --> 48:12.559
What was I supposed to do?
Just let 'em tear Musa's head off?

48:12.643 --> 48:15.270
-You weren't supposed to get t'd up.
-But that's my teammate.

48:15.354 --> 48:16.897
You the team, Jace.

48:18.315 --> 48:22.277
You can't afford to do stuff like that.
Other kids can, but you can't.

48:22.361 --> 48:26.365
Mom, as a leader,
it's my job to be there for them.

48:27.407 --> 48:28.992
Who told you that? Your coach?

48:29.576 --> 48:31.954
Nah. He didn't have to.

48:34.331 --> 48:35.332
So can I go?

48:38.001 --> 48:39.670
Boy, go.

48:41.380 --> 48:42.422
Love you, Mom.

48:42.506 --> 48:43.507
I love you too.

48:45.717 --> 48:49.263
Get on her! Come on! Back up!

48:49.346 --> 48:51.890
-Yeah. Lock up! Let's go! Let's go.
-I'm open!

48:54.184 --> 48:56.728
Yo, come on, Crys! Let's go! You got this!

48:58.564 --> 49:01.108
What are you doing? Fight for the threes!

49:03.485 --> 49:05.028
Corner! Corner!

49:08.282 --> 49:09.616
Crystal! Bench!

49:12.870 --> 49:18.083
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Let's go! Come on! Let's go!

49:23.881 --> 49:25.257
Come on! Come on! Come on!

49:31.597 --> 49:35.267
Sometimes we push the ball.
Other times we pound it inside.

49:35.350 --> 49:38.604
Depending on the matchup, really.
You never want to be one-dimensional.

49:38.687 --> 49:41.773
Yeah. I remember you guys gave us
a lot of different looks on D too.

49:41.857 --> 49:43.066
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

49:43.150 --> 49:45.569
But I think I can
learn your system pretty fast.

49:45.652 --> 49:48.197
And with me on the squad,
you might not lose again.

49:49.364 --> 49:52.367
But the thing is,
if I were to play for your team,

49:53.660 --> 49:54.995
I have to wear number 21.

49:57.414 --> 50:00.709
Well, that would be something
that we need to discuss.

50:02.920 --> 50:05.380
Every team I've ever played for,
I've had that number.

50:06.840 --> 50:09.635
I understand that,
but we already have a number 21.

50:10.427 --> 50:14.223
Coach, I'm gonna be honest with you.
It's nonnegotiable.

50:20.479 --> 50:23.815
Let me be honest with you.
If you're not willing to compromise,

50:23.899 --> 50:28.070
then I really don't see this
being a good fit.

50:28.153 --> 50:31.365
What's it about number 21?

50:32.157 --> 50:36.578
It's the same number Roberto Clemente wore
when he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

50:36.662 --> 50:41.124
Same number my father and grandfather wore
when they played basketball.

50:43.001 --> 50:44.253
I wear 21 to honor them.

50:49.967 --> 50:50.968
So, what do you think?

50:52.094 --> 50:53.971
I think we gotta find Vince a new number.

50:56.598 --> 50:57.933
Whatever.

51:12.364 --> 51:15.826
Sup. Thought you were
gonna flake on me for a minute.

51:15.909 --> 51:19.746
But then I said, she better not,
especially not after I made these.

51:24.418 --> 51:26.712
I admit,
they're not as good as yours, but--

51:28.881 --> 51:29.882
Hey.

51:30.799 --> 51:31.800
Hey.
