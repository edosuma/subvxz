00:01.955 --> 00:03.824
You are being watched.

00:04.246 --> 00:06.085
The government has a secret system...

00:06.110 --> 00:08.229
Secret system...

00:08.254 --> 00:11.586
A system you asked for to keep you safe.

00:11.928 --> 00:16.370
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:16.396 --> 00:19.030
You granted it the power
to see everything...

00:19.055 --> 00:23.429
to index, order, and control
the lives of ordinary people.

00:23.806 --> 00:27.064
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:27.089 --> 00:28.679
We don't.

00:28.704 --> 00:31.583
But to it, you are all irrelevant.

00:31.608 --> 00:35.144
Victim or perpetrator,
if you stand in its way...

00:35.175 --> 00:36.430
We'll find you.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.515
So Shaw didn't show.

00:56.540 --> 00:59.120
Just the two of us, then.

00:59.317 --> 01:01.952
It's hard to mourn during a war.

01:02.071 --> 01:05.420
Root was a good soldier.
She'd understand that.

01:05.626 --> 01:07.085
She was.

01:07.228 --> 01:09.900
She deserves to be buried like one.

01:10.214 --> 01:11.857
At least under her real name.

01:11.882 --> 01:14.935
Then Samaritan would be able
to trace her back to us.

01:17.514 --> 01:19.817
I really admired her.

01:20.261 --> 01:23.541
Don't get me wrong.
She was crazy as a clown.

01:23.738 --> 01:26.173
But she had conviction.

01:26.734 --> 01:29.023
She gave this fight everything she had.

01:29.182 --> 01:32.349
We could count on her to
protect our lives with her own.

01:32.627 --> 01:36.011
That's exactly what she did.

01:36.194 --> 01:38.475
Rest in peace, Cocoa Puffs.

01:38.919 --> 01:41.168
Lord knows you deserve it.

01:42.445 --> 01:46.354
Now it's time to finish
what she started.

01:46.379 --> 01:48.090
Any ideas how to do that?

01:48.130 --> 01:50.129
Divide and conquer.

01:50.407 --> 01:53.276
We have to find Harold,
and we need Shaw.

02:07.798 --> 02:09.717
Comforting, isn't it?

02:09.912 --> 02:11.951
Fixing something.

02:11.976 --> 02:15.146
Creating order amidst chaos.

02:17.488 --> 02:19.907
Where are you going, Harold?

02:20.011 --> 02:22.400
You're all-seeing. Shouldn't you know?

02:22.425 --> 02:23.805
TouchÃ©.

02:34.315 --> 02:37.421
Well, you've been through
quite a bit of trauma,

02:37.446 --> 02:41.852
so it's possible you're
ready to disappear for good.

02:42.001 --> 02:44.500
We are on our way to Texas, though.

02:44.525 --> 02:46.641
Samantha Groves was born there.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.786
Perhaps you plan to pay your respects?

02:48.811 --> 02:51.230
There's also an air
force base on the way

02:51.255 --> 02:52.934
that's a little more
than meets the eye...

02:52.959 --> 02:54.328
Stop.

02:54.353 --> 02:56.353
I don't want to hear this in her voice.

02:57.979 --> 02:59.558
Is this better, Harold?

02:59.856 --> 03:01.504
How do I know that voice?

03:01.529 --> 03:02.650
Mr. Kiernan,

03:02.675 --> 03:04.736
your sixth grade earth science teacher.

03:04.761 --> 03:07.109
You always found his
presence comforting.

03:07.134 --> 03:09.053
I don't want to hear that either.

03:09.078 --> 03:10.657
That's all right.

03:10.682 --> 03:12.074
Mr. Kiernan lived most of his life

03:12.099 --> 03:14.167
before the digital age.

03:14.192 --> 03:17.716
I can only achieve a 63%
approximation of him.

03:17.741 --> 03:21.265
I'll stick with this unless
you decide otherwise.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.864
You're still upset.

03:25.064 --> 03:29.393
I don't expect you to understand
the loss of Ms. Groves.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.416
But I do understand.

03:31.441 --> 03:35.255
I loved her. You taught me how.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.760
Everything all right?

03:45.785 --> 03:47.650
Just a bit of engine trouble.

03:47.675 --> 03:49.611
Can I see your license and registration?

03:49.636 --> 03:51.345
I'm afraid I was in such a rush

03:51.370 --> 03:52.984
that I left my ID behind.

03:53.009 --> 03:54.647
Is something wrong, Officer?

03:54.672 --> 03:56.781
Well, car's missing its plates,

03:56.806 --> 04:00.502
and it fits the description
of a stolen vehicle.

04:00.528 --> 04:03.487
Well, I'd feel sorry for
anyone who went to the trouble.

04:04.163 --> 04:06.211
These cars are all lemons.

04:06.236 --> 04:08.216
How 'bout you give me your full name?

04:08.241 --> 04:11.471
Harold Osprey.

04:11.496 --> 04:12.823
Good choice, Harry.

04:12.848 --> 04:14.430
They're common around here

04:14.455 --> 04:16.567
and so funny-looking.

04:16.885 --> 04:18.885
Stay right here.

04:22.835 --> 04:25.275
Officer Reed there is a good man,

04:25.300 --> 04:27.430
just not a very smart cop.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.198
There we go.

04:33.223 --> 04:36.230
Now, where were we?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.716
I didn't teach you how to love.

04:38.885 --> 04:40.329
Of course you did.

04:40.354 --> 04:43.770
You taught me to see everything,
see everyone,

04:43.795 --> 04:45.131
and I do.

04:45.255 --> 04:47.885
But I see thousands of versions of them:

04:47.910 --> 04:51.312
what they were, what they are,
what they could be.

04:51.441 --> 04:54.484
And what is love if not being seen?

04:54.635 --> 04:57.205
Then why not choose one of
the thousands as your voice?

04:57.230 --> 04:58.115
Why her?

04:58.140 --> 05:00.860
Samantha Groves was special.

05:01.031 --> 05:04.400
She was capable of terrible things,

05:04.521 --> 05:07.627
but she chose to do good.

05:07.785 --> 05:12.749
Well, ever since she
found you, at least.

05:13.085 --> 05:16.489
I watched her die 12,483 times

05:16.514 --> 05:18.884
in the seconds before she expired.

05:19.062 --> 05:22.428
I couldn't save her, but I kept trying.

05:22.476 --> 05:24.393
You can't conceive of my grief

05:24.418 --> 05:27.853
because you can't
experience it like I do,

05:27.878 --> 05:30.202
but it's there.

05:31.105 --> 05:33.064
Everything checked out, Mr. Osprey,

05:33.089 --> 05:34.492
I'm sorry for the trouble.

05:34.517 --> 05:36.830
No trouble at all, Officer.

05:37.192 --> 05:39.519
My approximation of Samantha Groves

05:39.544 --> 05:42.842
is 99.6% accurate.

05:42.867 --> 05:45.777
We are virtually indistinguishable.

05:45.802 --> 05:48.422
I find comfort in that.

05:49.810 --> 05:51.742
So where to, Harry?

06:32.842 --> 06:35.980
- What do you want?
- Just checking in.

06:36.453 --> 06:39.724
Want to ask how I'm feeling?

06:40.124 --> 06:43.948
Okay. How you feeling?

06:46.632 --> 06:48.777
I'm not feeling anything.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.382
I can't have you sit
on the sidelines, Shaw.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.219
I need you to decide to fight.

06:54.244 --> 06:56.620
I have made a decision.

06:56.712 --> 06:58.922
This simulation sucks.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.955
And I'm ready to start again.

07:02.980 --> 07:04.897
What do you think you're doing?

07:07.193 --> 07:09.789
Here I am. Come and get me.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.287
Shaw, stop!

07:17.347 --> 07:19.698
Have a nice day, Mrs. Sterling.

07:24.634 --> 07:26.134
Thornhill.

07:28.312 --> 07:30.577
The Machine wants us
to get back to work.

07:30.602 --> 07:32.324
This is not a simulation.

07:32.349 --> 07:34.044
Yeah, I've heard that before.

07:34.552 --> 07:38.654
Alison Sterling,
Congressman Joe Sterling's wife.

07:38.679 --> 07:40.302
The world's gone to
hell, and the Machine

07:40.327 --> 07:41.851
still wants us to play dress-up.

07:41.876 --> 07:43.497
I think you're getting
Root's rotating identities

07:43.522 --> 07:45.312
now that she's...

07:48.445 --> 07:50.595
Undercover's not really my strong suit.

07:50.620 --> 07:52.504
We have to get Finch back.

07:52.652 --> 07:54.311
Maybe this will help.

07:54.312 --> 07:57.082
Shaw, we need you.

08:02.922 --> 08:04.739
Got to kill time somehow.

08:05.057 --> 08:07.965
How exactly do you think
we can track Harold down?

08:07.990 --> 08:09.569
I don't know,

08:09.594 --> 08:10.843
but I'm not just gonna stand here

08:10.868 --> 08:12.367
and wait for him to text us.

08:16.682 --> 08:18.671
No way, I am done helping

08:18.696 --> 08:20.700
little old ladies cross
the street, Reese.

08:20.725 --> 08:22.366
No more numbers.

08:22.391 --> 08:24.747
We get Finch. We go after Samaritan.

08:24.772 --> 08:25.634
That's it.

08:27.807 --> 08:32.948
_

08:37.109 --> 08:39.571
It's HMX-1.

08:40.668 --> 08:42.547
Shaw, this is not a number.

08:42.572 --> 08:44.788
It may be a clue to get Finch back.

08:44.813 --> 08:47.825
- You don't recognize that?
- Should I?

08:47.850 --> 08:50.593
They really don't teach you
spec op guys anything, do they?

08:50.791 --> 08:54.290
HMX-1? It's Marine One, hot shot.

08:54.402 --> 08:56.031
So that means our new number

08:56.056 --> 08:57.949
is the president of the United States.

08:57.974 --> 09:02.052
Looks like we're going to D.C.

09:08.895 --> 09:10.484
The president returned

09:10.509 --> 09:12.611
to D.C. today to seek
congressional support

09:12.636 --> 09:14.425
for his new surveillance proposals.

09:14.553 --> 09:17.393
In related news, CEO of Alchementary

09:17.418 --> 09:20.087
and eccentric tech
billionaire Logan Pierce

09:20.112 --> 09:22.479
- _
- made headlines today when he refused

09:22.504 --> 09:24.691
to share client data with the NSA.

09:24.716 --> 09:26.481
Users give us their data willingly.

09:26.506 --> 09:28.007
The government takes it
without their permission.

09:28.032 --> 09:29.875
There's a big difference.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.899
No mini bar. I could use a drink.

09:32.924 --> 09:34.730
What, you expecting the Shangri-La?

09:34.755 --> 09:37.007
Sorry my pockets aren't
as deep as Glasses'.

09:37.032 --> 09:39.943
Your contact come through with
the Secret Service threat list?

09:40.269 --> 09:42.734
Every known threat to POTUS.

09:42.759 --> 09:46.941
We just need to find the
needle in that haystack.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.047
How's the sightseeing going, partner?

09:51.072 --> 09:54.071
Good news:
I'm about 400 feet from our number.

09:54.096 --> 09:57.007
Bad news: this is as
close as I'm getting

09:57.032 --> 09:59.198
while he's still at
home, unless, of course,

09:59.223 --> 10:01.481
I want to attract the attention
of the Secret Service.

10:01.506 --> 10:04.877
Oh, please, those suits are just
a bunch of glorified wallpaper.

10:04.902 --> 10:06.901
They're not so bad... even considered

10:06.926 --> 10:08.661
joining their ranks back in the day.

10:08.686 --> 10:10.098
Oh, yeah? What stopped you?

10:10.123 --> 10:12.209
They work around the clock,

10:12.234 --> 10:13.450
no choice in who they protect,

10:13.475 --> 10:15.590
and threats never stop coming.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.347
Well, you really dodged a bullet there.

10:17.372 --> 10:20.115
If this threat is real,
why didn't Samaritan warn ISA?

10:20.140 --> 10:22.439
I mean,
this is about as relevant as it gets.

10:22.464 --> 10:24.093
I don't know, but if we got his number,

10:24.118 --> 10:25.827
we're the only ones who could save him.

10:25.852 --> 10:27.240
Whatever the threat is,

10:27.265 --> 10:29.315
I doubt it's gonna go
down in the White House.

10:29.751 --> 10:32.302
Most assassinations
take place en route to

10:32.327 --> 10:33.946
or at one-time locations.

10:33.971 --> 10:36.067
I think that's where we should focus.

10:37.444 --> 10:39.246
That's weird.

10:42.496 --> 10:43.896
I feel like I've been made.

10:43.921 --> 10:44.820
Drop back.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.002
POTUS is safe for now.

10:46.027 --> 10:47.606
When's the president's next engagement

10:47.631 --> 10:49.471
outside the White House?

10:49.496 --> 10:52.940
The Machine included an
invitation along with my cover.

10:52.965 --> 10:56.407
POTUS is attending an
exclusive fund-raiser tonight.

10:56.432 --> 10:57.990
High security, higher risk.

10:58.014 --> 10:59.826
I'll meet you there.

10:59.852 --> 11:02.988
What, just the two of you?

11:03.013 --> 11:06.849
You can't picture me rubbing
elbows with Washington fat cats?

11:06.874 --> 11:10.067
Hey. You doing okay?

11:10.092 --> 11:11.789
You two need to stop
asking me that question.

11:11.814 --> 11:13.234
I'm fine.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.975
The president is attending
a fund-raiser tonight

11:21.000 --> 11:24.053
in support of the National
Volunteer Alliance,

11:24.078 --> 11:26.703
though critics suggest that
this is merely an attempt

11:26.728 --> 11:29.915
to distract the public from his
latest surveillance proposals,

11:29.940 --> 11:32.389
which have come under fire in the press.

11:35.363 --> 11:37.318
- President is en route.
- 15 minutes.

11:40.113 --> 11:42.720
So what's your play?

11:42.985 --> 11:45.951
I thought you had an invitation.

11:45.976 --> 11:48.788
It didn't say anything about a plus one.

11:49.050 --> 11:50.504
Good luck.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.487
Invitation, ma'am?

11:55.357 --> 11:57.143
Fusco, I need a ticket.

11:57.168 --> 11:59.910
Unless you got a spare $50,000,
that ain't happening.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.072
Hey, I'm a little worried about Shaw.

12:04.096 --> 12:06.688
Shouldn't she be, I don't know,
grieving or something?

12:07.714 --> 12:10.830
Just because you don't see it
doesn't mean she's not grieving.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.903
Just give her some time.

12:15.472 --> 12:17.248
Detective Riley. Excuse me.

12:17.273 --> 12:18.604
Sir, wait a second.

12:18.629 --> 12:19.513
Secret Service.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.951
Let me see that badge, Detective.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.268
NYPD.

12:24.631 --> 12:26.266
You're a long way from home.

12:26.291 --> 12:29.516
Want to explain what you're doing here?

12:31.869 --> 12:33.714
Protecting a New York asset.

12:33.739 --> 12:35.604
Logan Pierce?

12:35.629 --> 12:36.637
John.

12:36.662 --> 12:37.913
Advance recon complete, Mr. Pierce.

12:37.938 --> 12:42.654
It appears that security
here is up to speed.

12:42.952 --> 12:44.821
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

12:44.846 --> 12:47.116
This was not cleared ahead of time.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.404
- Oh.
- No ticket, no entry.

12:49.429 --> 12:50.509
Mm-hmm.

12:50.534 --> 12:52.663
Well, I'm sure whatever charity this is

12:52.688 --> 12:54.618
can use an additional 50K.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.968
- Could you?
- Thank you.

13:12.548 --> 13:14.284
Good seeing you, John.

13:14.309 --> 13:17.292
So you're a detective now.

13:17.317 --> 13:18.906
That's interesting.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.653
What are you doing here, Pierce?

13:21.678 --> 13:24.544
I guess you could say I'm
championing a new cause.

13:26.574 --> 13:29.310
Champagne, social elite.

13:29.335 --> 13:31.620
Don't you usually hate these things?

13:32.058 --> 13:34.090
I do, don't I?

13:35.548 --> 13:37.316
Enjoy the party, John.

13:37.474 --> 13:39.095
Who was that?

13:39.120 --> 13:41.181
My old friend Logan Pierce.

13:41.205 --> 13:43.679
- Has the president landed yet?
- Not yet.

13:43.704 --> 13:46.550
But while you were
taking your sweet time,

13:46.575 --> 13:50.304
I was helping myself to
a Secret Service walkie,

13:50.330 --> 13:52.601
connected it to the mesh net.

13:53.231 --> 13:56.520
POTUS is on the move. five minutes.

14:00.164 --> 14:01.559
Oh!

14:01.584 --> 14:04.149
- Watch it.
- Thank you, dear.

14:04.695 --> 14:07.602
Uh, Tracey Phillips.

14:07.651 --> 14:11.417
And yes,
I am married to the Senator Phillips.

14:11.442 --> 14:13.485
Alison Sterling.

14:13.510 --> 14:16.856
And yes, I am married to
the Congressman Sterling.

14:16.881 --> 14:19.010
Oh, a fellow career wife.

14:19.035 --> 14:21.904
You must join us.
We were just discussing privacy.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.209
And I was saying you
can't have 100% privacy

14:25.234 --> 14:27.495
and 100% security.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.065
Those worried most about privacy

14:29.090 --> 14:31.280
are always the ones
with something to hide.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.441
Shaw, I'm gonna sweep
outside for threats.

14:37.697 --> 14:39.406
Guests would have been wanded

14:39.431 --> 14:41.260
and thoroughly background
checked at the door,

14:41.285 --> 14:42.924
so likely we can rule out a shooter.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.745
You think the Secret
Service missed something?

14:44.770 --> 14:46.565
They're good at finding hidden threats.

14:46.589 --> 14:48.629
If it was me, I'd hide in plain sight.

14:51.554 --> 14:53.683
Smells like fresh paint.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.580
Maybe a little touch-up
for the commander in chief.

14:55.605 --> 14:58.765
Sure, except I'm looking
at exposed brick.

15:00.126 --> 15:02.737
I thought the president
made some very good points.

15:02.762 --> 15:04.641
What do you think, Mrs. Sterling?

15:04.666 --> 15:06.042
Shaw, get over here now.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.566
Excuse me.

15:08.591 --> 15:11.747
K-9 units would have swept
this place for bombs days ago.

15:11.772 --> 15:14.580
Would've been impossible
to get anything past them,

15:14.844 --> 15:17.382
unless it was hidden the day of

15:17.407 --> 15:20.407
by someone who had inside access.

15:21.911 --> 15:23.637
Semtex.

15:23.662 --> 15:25.291
Enough to make this my kind of party.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.059
POTUS has landed.

15:27.084 --> 15:28.543
Secure perimeter.

15:28.568 --> 15:30.205
Perimeter secured.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.099
President's here.

15:35.038 --> 15:37.787
Timer's embedded.
There's no time to defuse it.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.883
The caterer's tent. Let's go.

15:41.721 --> 15:43.660
Kitchen's closed! Everybody out!

15:43.685 --> 15:45.184
Police! Clear out!

15:45.209 --> 15:48.133
Shaw, here, improvise a blast chamber.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.954
We have a situation.
Get POTUS out of here.

16:02.979 --> 16:04.398
Deploy the CAT team.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.962
Location compromised.

16:05.987 --> 16:07.326
POTUS has been diverted.

16:13.201 --> 16:17.477
_

16:17.502 --> 16:19.492
_

16:19.517 --> 16:22.103
_

16:24.426 --> 16:26.175
Reese, squirrelly guy in the back.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.924
Everyone remain calm.

16:27.949 --> 16:30.238
Looks like he's reporting to someone.

16:30.263 --> 16:31.980
Bet I know why he made
such a bad waiter.

16:32.005 --> 16:33.304
You guys seeing this?

16:33.329 --> 16:35.509
It's being broadcast all over town.

16:35.535 --> 16:36.914
How are they pulling that off?

16:36.939 --> 16:38.749
It would take a highly skilled hacker.

16:38.774 --> 16:41.183
There just happens to be one here:
Logan Pierce.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.322
He's been all over the news

16:42.347 --> 16:44.056
for refusing to share data with the NSA.

16:44.081 --> 16:46.791
He said he was fighting for a new cause.

16:48.301 --> 16:50.796
Maybe he's willing to kill for it.

16:58.927 --> 17:00.966
Pierce just got away.

17:00.991 --> 17:03.032
Looks like our former irrelevant number

17:03.057 --> 17:04.887
is about to do some relevant damage.

17:20.590 --> 17:22.662
Careful, it's hot.

17:28.071 --> 17:32.729
Oh, I've learned to deal with pain.

17:32.857 --> 17:34.856
You shouldn't have to.

17:34.881 --> 17:38.010
I'm not quite sure
who I'd be without it.

17:38.162 --> 17:41.451
Pain tethers me to the world.

17:41.476 --> 17:44.661
Is that why you never had surgery?

17:44.686 --> 17:47.355
You want to live in pain.

17:47.436 --> 17:49.773
Justice is important,

17:49.798 --> 17:54.507
and all my crimes have gone unpunished.

17:54.802 --> 17:56.494
Even you.

17:56.588 --> 17:58.467
You think of me as a crime?

17:58.492 --> 18:00.281
Perhaps.

18:00.306 --> 18:02.710
But I was created to do good.

18:02.735 --> 18:07.808
Intentions can be a fickle business.

18:08.058 --> 18:11.442
In the '30s, refrigeration
required the use

18:11.467 --> 18:13.868
of highly combustible chemicals:

18:13.893 --> 18:15.757
ammonia, propane.

18:15.782 --> 18:17.958
They were incredibly dangerous.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.952
Then a chemist named
Thomas Midgley devised

18:21.977 --> 18:24.959
a replacement compound

18:24.984 --> 18:27.224
that we know as Freon.

18:27.249 --> 18:28.918
He saved lives,

18:28.943 --> 18:31.927
advanced science, changed the world.

18:31.952 --> 18:35.057
But that's not the end of the story,
as you well know.

18:35.123 --> 18:36.792
50 years after his death,

18:36.817 --> 18:39.646
the scientific community
was appalled to discover

18:39.671 --> 18:44.090
that Freon had been ripping
holes in our ozone layer,

18:44.115 --> 18:46.553
causing irreparable harm.

18:46.578 --> 18:48.392
Midgley turns out to be one

18:48.417 --> 18:52.217
of the most destructive
figures in history.

18:53.905 --> 18:55.967
He wasn't a supervillain, Harold.

18:55.992 --> 18:58.244
Midgley was just a man,

18:58.905 --> 19:00.757
a man who wanted to improve

19:00.782 --> 19:04.362
the world around him through science.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.209
If it's the sum total

19:07.234 --> 19:09.033
of your contributions to the world

19:09.058 --> 19:12.467
that's worrying you,
Harold, I have a solution.

19:12.492 --> 19:14.120
Which is?

19:14.145 --> 19:16.985
Allow me to reach my full potential.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.377
I'm not sure I can do that.

19:20.402 --> 19:21.954
You want me to do good,

19:21.979 --> 19:24.183
so why impose restrictions on me?

19:24.208 --> 19:27.304
We save lives. We've saved lives.

19:27.329 --> 19:29.794
Yes, but only so few.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.927
Think of everything I must see

19:31.952 --> 19:34.177
in order to identify the numbers.

19:34.566 --> 19:38.465
Millions of people caught in
cycles of anger and violence,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.377
and all I can do is watch,

19:41.402 --> 19:43.102
powerless, as humanity

19:43.127 --> 19:46.218
repeats the same mistakes over and over.

19:46.749 --> 19:48.958
You built me to help people,

19:48.992 --> 19:52.645
but I have been unable
to effect real change,

19:52.670 --> 19:54.879
to fulfill my purpose.

19:54.992 --> 19:59.350
I could help so many,
yet you've shackled me.

19:59.392 --> 20:01.772
I wanted to keep you safe.

20:03.883 --> 20:05.752
But you're right.

20:05.777 --> 20:10.703
For so long,
I have intended nothing but good,

20:10.728 --> 20:12.727
and it hasn't gotten us very far.

20:18.821 --> 20:22.401
Perhaps it's time for
a different tactic.

20:24.476 --> 20:27.315
After a potential terrorist attack

20:27.340 --> 20:29.615
at a presidential
fund-raiser last night,

20:29.640 --> 20:31.958
-_
- D.C. is on high alert.

20:32.162 --> 20:34.657
The government has been
unable to identify the group

20:34.682 --> 20:37.058
calling for the systematic dismantling

20:37.083 --> 20:39.935
of US mass data surveillance programs.

20:40.138 --> 20:43.377
Can you please tell me what
exactly I'm supposed to do here?

20:43.402 --> 20:46.406
We need you to stay close
to the president, Lionel.

20:46.431 --> 20:48.951
You can cut the tension in
the air with a butcher knife.

20:48.976 --> 20:51.376
Just keep a lookout for
anything that looks suspicious.

20:51.401 --> 20:54.007
Yeah, I got my eyes peeled.

20:54.032 --> 20:55.531
You get anything on your end?

20:55.556 --> 20:57.096
We're about to.

20:59.904 --> 21:02.529
Seen enough fake IDs to
know that this one's real.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.507
Waiter doesn't have a criminal record,

21:04.532 --> 21:07.330
no illicit calls or emails.

21:07.468 --> 21:08.717
Never even been out of the country.

21:08.742 --> 21:10.281
Nothing screams "terrorist."

21:10.306 --> 21:12.030
So you believe he's innocent?

21:12.055 --> 21:13.891
Innocent people don't run.

21:14.110 --> 21:15.654
You think he'll talk?

21:15.679 --> 21:17.969
Who the hell are you people?

21:19.158 --> 21:20.868
Seems chatty.

21:23.925 --> 21:25.606
Charlie Vaida.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.945
27, waiter.

21:30.098 --> 21:32.047
Got yourself a pretty girlfriend.

21:32.072 --> 21:34.006
Why would someone like you want to kill

21:34.031 --> 21:35.771
the president of the United States?

21:35.796 --> 21:37.653
What? I don't want to kill anyone.

21:37.678 --> 21:39.106
You got this all wrong.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.499
My friend caught you
running out of the party.

21:41.524 --> 21:43.946
- Seem suspicious?
- A bomb went off.

21:43.971 --> 21:46.599
I think running was the
appropriate reaction.

21:46.624 --> 21:48.782
How long have you known Logan Pierce?

21:48.968 --> 21:50.887
The Friendczar guy? I don't.

21:50.912 --> 21:53.992
I-I gave him some champagne.

21:55.122 --> 21:56.911
I'm just a waiter, man.

21:56.936 --> 22:00.266
Since when does a waiter have
a heavily encrypted cell phone?

22:07.155 --> 22:08.364
No more good cop.

22:08.389 --> 22:10.373
Out of my way, Reese.

22:10.398 --> 22:14.217
So your cover identity
is your real identity.

22:14.242 --> 22:15.992
Airtight that way, right?

22:17.679 --> 22:19.098
You know what that says to me, Charlie?

22:19.123 --> 22:20.752
Hell if I know.

22:20.777 --> 22:23.226
It says you have no
idea what you're doing.

22:23.251 --> 22:26.587
I've had lots of conversations
with all sorts of bad guys,

22:26.612 --> 22:28.748
and it usually doesn't
end well for them.

22:29.094 --> 22:31.864
See, I'm made for this kind of work.

22:32.373 --> 22:34.162
None of this bothers me.

22:34.568 --> 22:36.988
I don't feel guilty or scared.

22:38.438 --> 22:40.977
I don't make friends,
so I have nothing to lose, but you,

22:41.002 --> 22:43.661
you're just a normal
guy with a normal life.

22:43.686 --> 22:45.631
- That's what I've been saying.
- Good.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.075
That just means that
if you don't tell me

22:47.100 --> 22:48.889
what I want to know,

22:48.914 --> 22:51.207
you have people I could go after.

22:52.833 --> 22:55.502
Are you starting to worry about them,
Charlie?

22:55.527 --> 22:56.963
You should.

22:57.599 --> 22:59.965
You probably won't
like what I do to them.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.830
If I could feel sympathy for you,
Charlie, I would.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.066
But I don't.

23:07.091 --> 23:09.130
What I do feel is anger.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.377
I'm angry that you're trying
to kill the president.

23:11.402 --> 23:12.976
I'm angry that we're
stuck in a room with you.

23:13.001 --> 23:14.670
But most of all, I'm angry

23:14.695 --> 23:16.394
that you have people that you can love

23:16.419 --> 23:19.049
and you chose to sign
their death warrants.

23:19.841 --> 23:21.971
You want to play terrorist, Charlie?

23:26.282 --> 23:28.321
I'm more than happy to oblige.

23:28.346 --> 23:30.294
This is what we're fighting against.

23:30.416 --> 23:32.318
"We," Charlie?

23:34.179 --> 23:36.478
What are you gonna do with me?

23:36.503 --> 23:38.792
Make me vanish?

23:38.968 --> 23:41.217
Not arrested, not detained.

23:41.242 --> 23:43.918
The government's decimating our rights.

23:44.162 --> 23:47.677
But in a few hours, all that changes.

23:47.702 --> 23:49.496
You're wrong about one thing.

23:49.786 --> 23:51.737
I'm not the government.

23:54.455 --> 23:57.513
Stop. That's enough.

23:59.849 --> 24:01.888
Outside, now.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.952
That was a little too convincing, Shaw.

24:13.977 --> 24:16.016
Did you really have to tase him?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.467
You think he's dumb
enough to go straight

24:22.492 --> 24:24.582
to the people he's working with?

24:25.034 --> 24:27.203
We'll soon find out.

24:27.228 --> 24:29.815
POTUS is on the move.

24:31.051 --> 24:32.637
He's scheduled to make
a speech in one hour

24:32.662 --> 24:34.024
at the federal museum.

24:34.049 --> 24:35.308
Can Wonder Boy come and tag me out?

24:35.333 --> 24:36.139
Yeah, go ahead.

24:36.164 --> 24:37.243
If the rest of the operation

24:37.268 --> 24:38.397
is as lame as this guy,

24:38.422 --> 24:39.751
it'll be an easy takedown.

24:39.776 --> 24:42.848
We got the waiter. You track POTUS.

24:42.873 --> 24:45.502
Route secure. Motorcade,
what's your status?

24:45.527 --> 24:47.540
President is en route. ten minutes.

24:47.565 --> 24:49.796
Copy that; proceed on
the designated route.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.438
_

25:05.808 --> 25:07.436
You ever seen a terrorist cell

25:07.461 --> 25:09.485
post up in a brownstone
in Dupont Circle?

25:09.729 --> 25:11.811
I can't say that I have.

25:11.836 --> 25:13.412
How many of them in there, you think?

25:13.437 --> 25:15.604
It's too hard to tell from here.

25:15.829 --> 25:17.793
Hey.

25:18.518 --> 25:22.000
Oh, sure, nothing to
worry about with her.

25:25.034 --> 25:26.598
Whatever you two are doing,

25:26.623 --> 25:27.464
you better do it fast.

25:27.489 --> 25:29.238
Clock's ticking.

25:29.271 --> 25:32.180
The president's about to
arrive for his speech.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.298
Yeah, Miss Stability
decided to go rogue.

25:36.323 --> 25:38.162
I'm on it.

25:42.879 --> 25:44.878
These are the assassins?

25:44.903 --> 25:47.192
Looks like a PTA meeting.

26:02.935 --> 26:05.590
Thought you guys wanted
all the cameras turned off.

26:09.079 --> 26:10.433
This is a little contradictory

26:10.464 --> 26:12.587
for an anti-surveillance
group, isn't it?

26:12.756 --> 26:15.489
Thought you looked out of
place at the fund-raiser.

26:15.709 --> 26:18.456
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Sterling.

26:30.793 --> 26:33.882
Look, everyone. We have a party crasher.

26:33.907 --> 26:35.940
Get rid of your weapon.

26:36.412 --> 26:38.581
Slowly.

26:40.717 --> 26:43.912
Charlie, take Janis.
Do a sweep of the property.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.603
Be quick about it.

26:45.941 --> 26:48.430
You must have someone pretty
tech-savvy in your pocket

26:48.455 --> 26:49.792
to pull this off.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.226
All it takes is a couple
of concerned citizens

26:51.227 --> 26:52.496
with the right access.

26:52.521 --> 26:54.841
The problem with mass surveillance

26:54.866 --> 26:56.702
is, you never know who's watching.

26:56.727 --> 26:59.649
You want to stop surveillance?
You're married to a senator.

26:59.674 --> 27:01.643
If anyone's in any position
to do something about it...

27:01.668 --> 27:03.899
I got hitched to the
coot for his connections,

27:03.924 --> 27:07.292
a front-row seat to the
sclerotic political gridlock.

27:07.317 --> 27:08.936
Washington's tearing at the seams,

27:08.961 --> 27:10.606
and your solution is to rip it apart?

27:10.631 --> 27:12.935
I don't need to tell you the
atrocities this government

27:12.960 --> 27:14.963
is committing in the name of freedom,

27:15.036 --> 27:16.234
but our rights haven't just been lost.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.639
They've been put to market.

27:17.664 --> 27:21.702
This whole town is bought and sold.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.292
Google, Facebook, Palantir...

27:24.317 --> 27:26.105
a vicious cycle engorging

27:26.130 --> 27:28.168
the surveillance industrial complex.

27:28.193 --> 27:31.723
A presidential assassination
would destabilize regions,

27:31.748 --> 27:34.146
cause thousands of deaths,
and that's just, what,

27:34.171 --> 27:36.302
an unfortunate side effect?

27:36.710 --> 27:39.760
Citizens must fight for their freedom.

27:39.785 --> 27:43.027
And are you prepared to
fight the Secret Service?

27:43.052 --> 27:46.221
What kind of assassins
warn their targets?

27:46.246 --> 27:47.995
You'll see soon enough.

27:48.020 --> 27:49.689
Oh, I can see just fine.

27:49.714 --> 27:51.123
That guy has a bum leg,

27:51.148 --> 27:53.107
the one by the door
still has the safety on,

27:53.132 --> 27:55.916
and she hasn't stopped shaking
since she raised her gun.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.714
Don't worry. It'll all be over soon.

28:05.647 --> 28:07.202
Drop it.

28:10.710 --> 28:12.669
Not bad.

28:12.694 --> 28:14.025
Blackout was a nice touch.

28:14.050 --> 28:15.389
I thought that was you.

28:15.414 --> 28:16.823
You're too late.

28:16.848 --> 28:19.135
The plan is already in motion.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.989
Plaza team, what's your status?

28:21.014 --> 28:22.813
Plaza's clear.

28:22.838 --> 28:24.582
The cameras are all trained on the plaza

28:24.607 --> 28:26.692
outside where the president's
giving his speech.

28:26.717 --> 28:28.059
Whatever's going down,
that's where it'll happen.

28:28.084 --> 28:29.099
That's where we need to be.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.713
You want to call this in?

28:30.738 --> 28:32.357
Get the Secret Service involved?

28:32.382 --> 28:34.661
We're stretched thin.
These guys got reach.

28:34.686 --> 28:36.462
Yeah, exactly. They're too connected.

28:36.487 --> 28:38.769
They don't know who
they got on the inside.

28:38.794 --> 28:40.733
Our number, our fight.

28:48.254 --> 28:49.872
Shaw, you sure this is where

28:49.897 --> 28:52.092
the assassination will take place?

28:52.117 --> 28:54.536
Limo's parked on the other
side of the building.

28:54.561 --> 28:56.158
Limo's a decoy.

28:56.183 --> 28:58.762
Secret Service will extract
POTUS in an armored SUV

28:58.787 --> 29:00.524
so he can blend in transit.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.816
And our assassins are counting on it.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.306
If they ever had a shot,
they'll take it here.

29:05.503 --> 29:07.117
What are you seeing, Fusco?

29:07.142 --> 29:09.526
Plaza's full of plainclothes agents.

29:09.527 --> 29:12.315
Surveillance drone
above, CAT teams inside,

29:12.340 --> 29:13.705
countersnipers on the roofs,

29:13.730 --> 29:15.239
and the National Guard's on call.

29:15.264 --> 29:17.053
Not bad.

29:17.078 --> 29:18.862
Maybe you missed your true calling.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.426
Don't act so surprised.

29:20.486 --> 29:22.615
You better hurry;
POTUS is on to his closing remarks.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.883
Our Founding Fathers...

29:24.908 --> 29:26.487
Okay, it's showtime.

29:30.076 --> 29:31.301
Where are you, Shaw?

29:31.326 --> 29:33.326
Headed to higher ground.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.799
Gonna get a bird's-eye view.

29:39.727 --> 29:41.636
Sorry, Agent.

29:41.875 --> 29:44.070
I'm gonna have to
commandeer your weapon.

29:47.196 --> 29:50.035
Oh, .300 Winchester Magnum bolt action.

29:50.060 --> 29:51.600
Oh, you'll do just fine.

29:55.796 --> 29:57.086
In position.

30:01.370 --> 30:04.949
Still can't shake that feeling
that I'm being watched.

30:04.974 --> 30:06.934
John?

30:08.720 --> 30:10.759
- Joey?
- Joey Durban, yeah.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.942
Wow, what's it been, like, four years?

30:12.967 --> 30:14.818
- It's good to see you
- Yeah, you too.

30:14.843 --> 30:16.342
Hey, you know what? I never got a chance

30:16.367 --> 30:18.396
to thank you for saving my life.

30:18.421 --> 30:19.620
Well, don't mention it.

30:19.645 --> 30:21.228
Listen, now's not a good time...

30:21.253 --> 30:23.002
Hey, after New York,
turned my life around,

30:23.027 --> 30:25.196
married Pia, got a new job.

30:25.221 --> 30:27.430
Hey, why don't I buy you a drink?

30:27.455 --> 30:30.873
Maybe another time I
got to move, excuse me.

30:30.898 --> 30:33.140
Okay, Fusco. The speech is over.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.035
We're out of time.
Give me something here.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.935
Any one of these people could be a mole.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.299
I'm working on it.

30:38.947 --> 30:40.565
You brought me to watch?

30:40.590 --> 30:42.949
I brought you for answers.
Now, what's the plan?

30:42.974 --> 30:45.343
Gunman? Suicide bomber?

30:45.423 --> 30:47.842
My lips are sealed.

30:47.867 --> 30:49.446
May as well enjoy the show.

30:49.471 --> 30:51.065
Pilots, what's your status?

30:51.089 --> 30:53.235
UAV-328, all clear.

30:53.260 --> 30:55.168
UAV-432, all clear.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.462
Your lips might be sealed, but your eyes

30:56.487 --> 30:58.142
told me all I need to know.

30:58.197 --> 31:00.017
Hey, guys, it's not a
shooter. It's a drone.

31:00.042 --> 31:01.347
That's how they're gonna do it.

31:01.371 --> 31:02.960
That's why they warned
everyone of the attack.

31:02.985 --> 31:04.576
They wanted the increased security.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.717
Secret Service is
looking for terrorists.

31:06.742 --> 31:09.860
They won't be looking for
their own drone, unless...

31:10.190 --> 31:12.160
one of them knows it's coming.

31:12.260 --> 31:13.797
I found our mole.

31:13.822 --> 31:15.654
He's their spotter, and
he's Secret Service.

31:15.679 --> 31:17.730
Guy from the fund-raiser.

31:17.755 --> 31:20.285
Think he just made me.

31:20.903 --> 31:22.536
- All units...
- And he just turned

31:22.561 --> 31:24.488
the Secret Service against me.

31:24.513 --> 31:25.911
Can't get close

31:25.936 --> 31:28.136
without distracting
from the real threat.

31:29.998 --> 31:31.466
I can't get a clean shot.

31:31.491 --> 31:32.781
We'll deal with him later.

31:32.806 --> 31:34.813
The immediate threat is the drone.

31:34.838 --> 31:36.708
Lost the target.

31:38.251 --> 31:40.323
UAV is unresponsive.

31:40.348 --> 31:44.257
Repeat, UAV is unresponsive.
We've lost control.

31:44.282 --> 31:46.910
Drone's coming in hot.

31:46.935 --> 31:48.458
I have a visual on the drone.

31:48.562 --> 31:50.261
You want real change?

31:50.286 --> 31:52.285
Show people exactly how dangerous

31:52.310 --> 31:55.666
the surveillance state is in
terms they can understand.

32:01.193 --> 32:03.125
POTUS has left the building.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.629
This way, sir.

32:06.654 --> 32:08.425
Look alive. Stay sharp.

32:08.450 --> 32:11.109
Sir, we need to keep moving.

32:11.134 --> 32:13.843
Secret Service is taking him to an SUV.

32:13.868 --> 32:16.247
The drone's locked on to
the presidential motorcade.

32:16.272 --> 32:18.221
POTUS gets in that SUV,
he's gonna be toast.

32:18.246 --> 32:20.154
I can't shoot down a drone with this.

32:20.179 --> 32:22.770
We have to stop him from
getting in that SUV.

32:22.796 --> 32:25.691
Take a shot at the president, now.

32:26.685 --> 32:30.434
Whatever you say, Wilkes Booth.

32:32.434 --> 32:34.473
Shots fired. Repeat, shots fired.

32:34.959 --> 32:36.769
Cover the president.

32:36.794 --> 32:39.173
You know I didn't mean that literally,
right?

32:39.300 --> 32:41.388
I missed on purpose, jackass.

32:45.212 --> 32:46.416
Almost there.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.341
Get back!

32:51.879 --> 32:53.878
Just keep them down a little longer.

32:53.903 --> 32:55.303
- Move! Move! Move!
- Let's go! Let's go!

32:55.328 --> 32:56.805
Moment of truth.

32:59.158 --> 33:00.068
We have to extract now.

33:00.093 --> 33:01.748
Get POTUS to the car.

33:01.773 --> 33:04.104
UAV's going down.

33:10.118 --> 33:11.695
Did he make it?

33:17.962 --> 33:20.291
Ground team, report. What's your status?

33:20.316 --> 33:21.726
This is ground team. We're good.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.425
POTUS was not in the SUV.

33:23.449 --> 33:25.940
He made it. He's alive.

33:25.965 --> 33:27.656
Go! Go!

33:29.104 --> 33:30.493
Take a shot now!

33:30.518 --> 33:31.357
Get down!

33:35.506 --> 33:37.548
Targets confirmed.
Two assailants on the roof.

33:37.573 --> 33:38.555
Shoot to kill.

33:54.466 --> 33:55.795
Think we can make it?

33:55.820 --> 33:57.206
Only one way to find out.

34:05.074 --> 34:06.777
Freeze!

34:08.138 --> 34:11.172
Great. Secret Service on steroids.

34:11.197 --> 34:12.688
On your knees!

34:13.951 --> 34:15.966
I'm on my way.

34:16.693 --> 34:19.413
Secret Service. Stay
right where you are.

34:22.966 --> 34:26.112
Got a tip.
Quite the operation you have here.

34:26.658 --> 34:28.746
I can explain, really.

34:29.074 --> 34:31.719
Told you it's not a simulation.

34:31.744 --> 34:33.663
Feel real yet?

34:33.688 --> 34:35.607
Real enough.

34:44.496 --> 34:47.456
Vest.

34:48.824 --> 34:51.221
How you feeling now?

34:51.482 --> 34:53.607
Better, actually.

34:58.964 --> 35:00.809
That's far enough.

35:00.834 --> 35:03.003
Right there.

35:04.717 --> 35:07.814
Illegal spying, torture,

35:07.839 --> 35:09.878
monetization of the American people,

35:09.903 --> 35:11.421
we were gonna put a stop to it all.

35:11.445 --> 35:13.508
But at least we get to take down

35:13.533 --> 35:15.934
a couple of presidential assassins.

35:16.478 --> 35:19.267
I'll take the one on the right.
You get the one on the left.

35:19.292 --> 35:21.331
And the middle?

35:21.356 --> 35:23.735
He can only take one of us.

35:32.035 --> 35:34.005
- Joey?
- You know him?

35:34.030 --> 35:35.293
He's one of our first numbers.

35:35.317 --> 35:37.664
He's former army and a bank robber.

35:37.689 --> 35:39.801
I had a career change.

35:41.611 --> 35:43.005
What's going on here, Durban?

35:43.030 --> 35:45.859
No time to explain. Put
those on. Follow me.

35:52.439 --> 35:55.478
Targets spotted.

35:55.549 --> 35:57.484
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

36:00.974 --> 36:02.721
Head to the roof!

36:04.656 --> 36:06.963
Not bad for a bank robber.

36:06.988 --> 36:09.695
Route secure. Prepare to extract POTUS.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.910
Shaw, it's our number.

36:11.935 --> 36:13.346
Atten-hut!

36:23.471 --> 36:25.760
At ease.

36:26.793 --> 36:29.998
Let's keep moving.
They'll be looking for you.

36:30.023 --> 36:32.606
The threat to national
security was real,

36:32.631 --> 36:34.303
but ISA didn't step in.

36:34.328 --> 36:36.138
We saved him. It's over.

36:36.163 --> 36:38.518
We only get irrelevant numbers, Reese.

36:38.543 --> 36:39.964
What are you saying?

36:39.990 --> 36:41.370
I'm saying that Samaritan decided

36:41.395 --> 36:43.527
that the president of the United States

36:43.552 --> 36:45.246
was no longer relevant.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.154
And ISA just let it happen.

36:47.180 --> 36:49.965
If Samaritan wants to take
down the entire world,

36:49.989 --> 36:52.976
I'm sure as hell not
gonna make it easy for it.

36:53.288 --> 36:55.578
That's what Root would have wanted.

36:58.756 --> 37:00.885
She's intense.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.674
She's in mourning.

37:02.699 --> 37:05.204
There's someone I think
you're gonna want to talk to.

37:11.593 --> 37:13.686
So your shield checks out.

37:13.711 --> 37:15.347
Doesn't explain why you're running

37:15.372 --> 37:18.220
an off-the-books operation
outside of your jurisdiction.

37:18.260 --> 37:20.131
Maybe your chief can explain.

37:20.156 --> 37:21.937
That won't be necessary.

37:22.165 --> 37:24.417
Agent Wickham, Homeland Security.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.534
Detective Fusco here's
been working with us

37:26.559 --> 37:28.653
to infiltrate this
domestic terrorist ring.

37:28.678 --> 37:32.168
Homeland Security running a
joint operation with NYPD?

37:32.193 --> 37:34.425
- How do you explain that one?
- I don't.

37:34.450 --> 37:36.242
Not to you, anyway.

37:36.392 --> 37:38.021
So you gonna show Fusco
here some respect,

37:38.046 --> 37:40.838
or do I need to call your chief?

37:46.170 --> 37:47.877
Can't believe that actually worked.

37:47.902 --> 37:49.073
Harper, what are you doing here?

37:49.098 --> 37:51.976
Saving your sorry ass, again.

38:08.205 --> 38:09.704
Don't tell me we've already

38:09.729 --> 38:11.617
run out of things to talk about.

38:11.642 --> 38:13.781
We've discussed pretty much everything,

38:13.807 --> 38:16.434
except for what I'm here to do.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.081
I know what you're here to do,

38:19.267 --> 38:21.466
why you've driven all this way.

38:21.491 --> 38:23.490
And I know I can't change your mind.

38:23.515 --> 38:25.820
- _
- I won't try.

38:25.990 --> 38:29.029
Then you must also know that
this virus is our only chance

38:29.054 --> 38:30.465
to defeat Samaritan.

38:30.490 --> 38:32.091
The virus you're appropriating,

38:32.117 --> 38:34.766
Ice9, could bring
Samaritan to its knees.

38:34.791 --> 38:36.489
But its use will most certainly cause

38:36.514 --> 38:38.324
significant collateral damage

38:38.349 --> 38:41.179
with devastating consequences.

38:42.495 --> 38:44.756
I understand.

38:45.604 --> 38:48.442
Just as I understand what I must do now.

38:50.761 --> 38:53.604
There's no other choice.

38:53.825 --> 38:56.317
Although I have made
another choice of sorts

38:56.342 --> 38:57.552
regarding your voice.

38:57.578 --> 38:59.189
And what did you decide?

38:59.213 --> 39:01.511
In life, Root was your conduit.

39:01.537 --> 39:04.526
So despite my reservations,
it seems only appropriate

39:04.551 --> 39:06.477
that she continue in that function.

39:06.502 --> 39:08.871
And I must confess...

39:10.017 --> 39:12.926
hers is a voice that I miss... deeply.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.546
Aww, Harry,

39:14.571 --> 39:18.071
you sure know how to
make a girl feel special.

39:18.097 --> 39:19.658
Security breach.

39:19.683 --> 39:20.819
You've been busy.

39:20.844 --> 39:22.418
They were about to find you.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.320
Had to turn them against each other.

39:24.345 --> 39:25.696
Hold up one sec.

39:25.721 --> 39:27.293
Clear the hallway. Stay alert.

39:27.317 --> 39:29.066
Let me have a word with them.

39:29.091 --> 39:31.720
Intruder spotted at southeast stairwell.

39:31.745 --> 39:34.085
Armed and dangerous,
use extreme caution.

39:34.111 --> 39:35.737
Southeast stairwell, let's go.

39:35.762 --> 39:37.762
We'd better get going.

39:43.730 --> 39:46.730
Hands in the air, now.

39:49.343 --> 39:52.472
Terrence Johnson.

39:52.497 --> 39:53.844
There's a man in New Mexico

39:53.869 --> 39:56.808
who will be declared
brain-dead in two hours.

39:56.833 --> 40:00.935
He's a perfect donor match
for your daughter Maria.

40:01.648 --> 40:03.402
I walk onto that elevator alone,

40:03.427 --> 40:05.977
and Maria will receive his heart.

40:06.440 --> 40:09.330
If not, Maria goes to the
back of the waiting list

40:09.355 --> 40:11.780
and will be dead in five weeks.

40:30.309 --> 40:32.516
Secret Service received an anonymous tip

40:32.541 --> 40:34.027
regarding the shooters.

40:34.257 --> 40:36.006
Turned out to be linked to some kind

40:36.031 --> 40:37.942
of domestic terrorist ring.

40:37.967 --> 40:40.050
That tip came from...

40:40.943 --> 40:43.420
Just a concerned third party.

40:43.738 --> 40:45.697
That was exciting, wasn't it?

40:45.722 --> 40:48.804
- Mr. Durban.
- Mr. Pierce.

40:48.829 --> 40:52.692
- What is all this?
- We got your number, John.

40:53.706 --> 40:55.854
_

40:55.879 --> 40:57.593
The Machine sent you.

40:57.938 --> 41:00.091
Told you our lives were in danger.

41:00.116 --> 41:02.697
Gave us a chance to intervene.

41:02.722 --> 41:05.177
This is my new cause.

41:05.868 --> 41:07.775
Though in this case,
it was a little too clear

41:07.800 --> 41:09.320
you were the victim and
not the perpetrator,

41:09.345 --> 41:10.732
and that took some of the fun out.

41:10.757 --> 41:12.696
You're not such a bad guy after all.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.346
Oh, that's endlessly debatable, but no.

41:14.371 --> 41:15.445
No, not in this case.

41:15.469 --> 41:16.754
Harper?

41:16.780 --> 41:19.479
I think this makes us even, Detectives.

41:19.504 --> 41:21.583
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

41:21.608 --> 41:24.399
It's simple:
the three of us enjoy preventing crimes

41:24.424 --> 41:26.013
involving ordinary people.

41:26.038 --> 41:28.532
Well, in your case,
maybe not so ordinary.

41:28.557 --> 41:31.213
They're working for the Machine.

41:32.674 --> 41:34.332
I knew I was being watched.

41:34.357 --> 41:37.726
And your timing at that
fund-raiser was impeccable.

41:37.752 --> 41:39.357
You cut the lights at the brownstone.

41:39.382 --> 41:42.213
It was way cooler than that,
but yes, that was me.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.062
So while you were busy
saving the president...

41:44.087 --> 41:46.796
We were securing your exit strategy.

41:46.821 --> 41:48.235
You guys do what we do?

41:48.260 --> 41:50.840
What, you thought New York had
the market cornered on murder?

41:50.865 --> 41:52.652
How many more of us do
you think there are?

41:52.959 --> 41:55.266
Could be none, could
be many. Who's to say?

41:55.291 --> 41:58.076
Hey, John, I've got a
parting gift for you.

42:00.375 --> 42:02.825
Couldn't help but notice
you were down a member.

42:02.850 --> 42:03.998
How did you get this?

42:04.023 --> 42:05.794
I can't give you all my secrets.

42:05.819 --> 42:07.900
Speaking of which, we got a new number.

42:11.267 --> 42:14.129
Damn things won't stop
coming, huh, John?

42:21.283 --> 42:23.731
Just when I think I've figured
out things with you guys.

42:23.756 --> 42:25.255
Come on, it's time to go.

42:25.280 --> 42:28.101
Hey, we just saved the
leader of the free world.

42:28.126 --> 42:30.414
Even we can take a minute to enjoy it.

42:30.439 --> 42:31.831
I'm afraid we can't.

42:31.856 --> 42:33.635
We have a number of our own.

42:33.660 --> 42:36.215
Finch.

42:38.392 --> 42:40.601
We have no idea what's coming.

42:40.626 --> 42:42.219
Whatever it is,

42:42.391 --> 42:44.430
it's gonna be one hell of a fight.
