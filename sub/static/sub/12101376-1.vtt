WEBVTT

00:33.033 --> 00:36.494
[dark, brooding music playing]

00:44.294 --> 00:46.671
[woman breathing heavily]

00:49.924 --> 00:51.926
[woman breathing shakily]

00:53.511 --> 00:54.596
[gasps]

00:54.679 --> 00:55.764
[breathing rapidly]

00:56.431 --> 00:59.392
[haunting music plays]

01:06.483 --> 01:09.027
[children shouting playfully in distance]

01:48.525 --> 01:50.652
[laptop buzzing softly]

02:07.794 --> 02:10.505
[haunting music continues]

02:14.551 --> 02:16.302
-[woman] What are you eating?
-[girl] Guess.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.097
-[woman] I can't guess.
-[girl in sing-song] Bet you can.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.266
-[woman] How can I guess?
-[girl] What day is it today?

02:21.349 --> 02:22.809
[woman] Uh, it's Monday.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.853
Oh. Sunday night's pizza night.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.688
-You're eating leftover pizza.
-[girl giggles]

02:26.771 --> 02:30.233
Hey, make Dad go pick you out a pumpkin.
It's that time of year again.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.734
-They're all over.
-[buzzer rings]

02:31.818 --> 02:33.194
-[girl] Okay.
-[woman] All right.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.780
-Let me talk to Daddy, sweetheart.
-[boy over intercom] Delivery.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.240
-[girl] Daddy!
-[buzzing]

02:37.949 --> 02:39.117
Daddy!

02:45.957 --> 02:47.000
[meowing]

02:49.586 --> 02:51.421
-[man] Hey, Slugger.
-[woman] Hey.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.674
[man] Tell me something good.
-[woman] Something good.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.801
[both chuckle]

02:56.885 --> 02:59.637
-[woman] You were right about 101.
-[man] How's that?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.557
[woman] The Russells are very white.
[chuckles]

03:02.640 --> 03:05.143
[man] There goes the neighborhood.
[chuckles]

03:05.226 --> 03:07.854
[woman] But who moves in
after a one-day paint job?

03:07.937 --> 03:10.148
[man] Well, you said it was in good shape.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.194
[woman] I wish you were here.

03:14.277 --> 03:17.864
-[man] Who does that help, saying that?
-[woman] I can beat myself up if I want.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.742
[man] Go for it.
It's just an audience of one.

03:20.825 --> 03:21.993
I'm not playing.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.621
[woman] Tell me to go outside.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.124
[man] Why not make today
the day you go outside?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.877
So, what's the latest on the street?

03:32.086 --> 03:34.088
What happened with the barking dog?

03:34.923 --> 03:37.508
I thought we were going
to talk about medications.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.843
We'll get there.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.387
Would you like to take a seat?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.848
Did it get squared away?

03:43.932 --> 03:44.891
The dog?

03:45.975 --> 03:47.101
Um…

03:47.185 --> 03:50.104
I guess they started bringing him inside.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.940
Did you end up calling 311?

03:52.023 --> 03:54.150
[chuckles] Oh, David talked me out of it.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.820
It's more of a bother for him anyway.
It's louder downstairs.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.907
So, I… must have talked to somebody.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.325
Peaceful resolution.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.869
This is the second session
that you've done this.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.454
Ask about the neighborhood?

04:07.997 --> 04:09.832
Does that make you uncomfortable?

04:09.916 --> 04:12.293
I just don't know what you're goin' for.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.546
How's the prayer group?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.799
[woman sighs] They're getting by.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.343
[man]
Do you think they know you're watching?

04:20.426 --> 04:22.512
Is this really what you wanna talk about?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.057
What about 101?

04:27.475 --> 04:29.143
Looks like they already moved in.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.645
What'd they pay?

04:30.728 --> 04:32.939
Five-five. They were asking for six.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.148
Who are they?

04:34.232 --> 04:35.275
The Russells.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.736
Alistair and Jane.
The broker says they're from Boston.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.988
Where's the money from?

04:40.530 --> 04:41.948
She says he's a banker.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.117
But there's practically
nothing about them online.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.493
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.203
What the fuck, Karl?

04:47.787 --> 04:51.291
Curiosity is evidence
of a decreased depression pattern.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.712
People who snoop on their neighbors
don't kill themselves? [chuckles]

04:56.796 --> 04:58.256
Let's try this.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.342
People who attempt suicide
lose the right to joke about it.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.889
I have a review with Dr. Kenner this week.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.310
Seeing as I've been unable to get you
out the front door for the last 10 months,

05:10.393 --> 05:12.437
she's gonna wonder about
the source of my optimism.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.189
Let's talk about the Elevan.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.525
Now that you've curtailed the drinking,

05:17.608 --> 05:19.569
how are you feeling
about the side effects?

05:20.278 --> 05:22.363
[sloshing]

05:22.447 --> 05:24.032
[man] I think you're reading into it.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.744
[woman] I've been a shrink for 15 years.
I know a threat when I hear one.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.162
[man] He's on your side, Slugger.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.997
He's the reason you're still here.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.666
[woman] It's not really therapy
if there's a knife at your back.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.003
[man] He comes every week, rain or shine.
He's been there all the way through.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.589
[woman]
No, he's getting off on controlling me.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.008
-[man] Really?
-[woman] Yes. Did you read about Elevan?

05:42.091 --> 05:43.384
Take a look at the side effects.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.428
[man]
I know you're not supposed to drink on it.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.430
[woman chuckles] They always say that.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.516
[insistent music playing]

06:05.323 --> 06:07.075
[trumpet playing]

06:13.206 --> 06:14.332
[sighs]

06:22.173 --> 06:23.841
[woman breathing heavily]

06:28.096 --> 06:29.305
-[buzzer rings]
-[gasps]

06:29.389 --> 06:30.681
[glass shatters]

06:30.765 --> 06:31.849
Shit.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.267
[paper rustling]

06:36.729 --> 06:39.607
[insistent music swelling]

06:39.690 --> 06:40.942
[buzzer rings]

06:42.610 --> 06:43.778
Yes?

06:43.861 --> 06:46.572
[boy over speaker]
I live, um, across the street there.

06:47.990 --> 06:48.825
And?

06:49.450 --> 06:51.494
My mom asked me to give you this.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.413
I'm sorry…

06:54.330 --> 06:56.332
I'm not prepared for visitors.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.084
[boy] Oh, okay.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.962
Do you have any ideas about
what I should do with this?

07:02.547 --> 07:03.589
You can just…

07:06.217 --> 07:07.468
Push the door.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.762
[buzzer sounds]

07:11.264 --> 07:12.807
Hi. I'm Ethan.

07:12.890 --> 07:13.766
Yes.

07:14.308 --> 07:15.601
Hi. Anna.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.771
I'm from… across the street.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.314
[Anna] Yes.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.443
Sorry, I know you're not having,
uh, visitors.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.153
No, I'm… fine.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.029
You just surprised me, that's all.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.323
I'm not really a visitor so much.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.034
I'm kind of, uh, more like a neighbor.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.207
-I love lavender.
-Heh.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.586
My mom asked me
to give it to you, like… days ago.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.881
I think that I'm the one
supposed to be giving you a gift, eh…

07:44.964 --> 07:46.382
Welcome to the neighborhood.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.925
-[cat meows]
-[Ethan] Mm.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.725
I like cats' tongues.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.479
Sorry they're not fish fingers, buddy.
[chuckles]

07:59.562 --> 08:00.730
He likes you.

08:01.689 --> 08:02.523
No.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.693
How do you like your new house?

08:05.776 --> 08:07.278
I miss the old one.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.031
But we had to leave Boston.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.284
Are those your… people?

08:13.367 --> 08:14.827
Family? Yes.

08:15.953 --> 08:16.913
Are they home?

08:18.956 --> 08:21.501
No, they don't live here. We're separated.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.128
How old is she?

08:25.379 --> 08:26.547
She's eight.

08:29.717 --> 08:30.968
How old are you?

08:31.552 --> 08:33.638
I'm gonna be 16 in six months.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.722
Five months.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.813
What do you do?

08:45.191 --> 08:48.319
Oh, I'm a psychologist. I work with kids.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.278
Really?

08:49.862 --> 08:50.947
Really.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.407
-That's interesting.
-Why is that interesting?

08:53.491 --> 08:57.370
I mean, it's more interesting
than, like, working at Taco Bell.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.497
-[chuckles]
-Why would kids need a psychologist?

08:59.580 --> 09:01.791
You really don't know why
a kid would need a psychologist?

09:01.874 --> 09:04.460
No, I mean, I'm sure they do,
but I mean, like, why?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.463
Like, why do the kids who see you
need a psychologist?

09:07.547 --> 09:10.675
-All sorts of reasons.
-School shootings or torturing someone?

09:10.758 --> 09:14.720
No, it doesn't have to be that dramatic.
Some of them are depressed,

09:14.804 --> 09:16.305
some suffer from anxiety…

09:16.389 --> 09:20.142
some of them are… just having
a hard time adjusting to a new place.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.362
I can see your house from my room.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.240
[elusive music plays]

09:34.824 --> 09:35.866
I mean…

09:36.701 --> 09:37.660
normally.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.956
Right now, I can see…

09:43.165 --> 09:45.001
my dad from your house.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.296
[Ethan sighs]

09:52.383 --> 09:53.217
Are you okay?

09:54.635 --> 09:55.469
[Ethan] Yeah.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.680
Are you sure?

09:59.265 --> 10:00.641
No, nothing, I just…

10:01.642 --> 10:02.727
[softly] Hey.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.103
[gasps softly]

10:07.440 --> 10:08.566
You can talk to me.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.736
I don't know anyone here.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.654
You know me.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.656
Not really.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.284
Well, you could.

10:18.951 --> 10:19.952
Really?

10:20.036 --> 10:21.954
We-we can be friends?

10:25.082 --> 10:26.000
Sure.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.171
Wow. You have a lot of movies.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.424
Too many. That's what my husband says.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.052
I thought you said
you guys were separated.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.638
He's still my husband, but you're right.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.682
You're welcome to borrow anything.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.144
Uh… My dad's kind of a tyrant with the TV.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.313
Oh.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.486
-Goodbye, Punch.
-[purrs]

10:53.569 --> 10:55.696
I'm sorry I'm so allergic to you.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.491
Why didn't you say something?

10:59.075 --> 10:59.992
Oh.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.661
I don't wanna offend him.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.954
He's not that sensitive.

11:04.538 --> 11:05.456
Okay.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.250
[Punch meows softly]

11:14.006 --> 11:15.007
Okay, then.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.759
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.014
See you around?

11:22.098 --> 11:23.182
Yeah, see you around.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.103
[elusive music turns warmer]

11:27.186 --> 11:31.440
…in some incredibly rustic community
where good manners are unknown…

11:31.524 --> 11:34.360
[man and Anna] …or you suffer
from the common feminine delusion

11:34.443 --> 11:36.195
that the mere fact of being a woman

11:36.278 --> 11:38.948
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.241
[Anna] Conduct.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.034
-[man and Anna] Possibly both.
-[laughing]

11:42.118 --> 11:44.704
[woman on TV] Possibly.
But here's what I wanted to show you…

11:44.787 --> 11:46.080
[continues laughing]

11:47.373 --> 11:49.041
[coughing]

11:54.630 --> 11:55.548
[laughing]

11:56.590 --> 11:57.675
[loud thud]

12:00.469 --> 12:02.847
-[Anna shudders]
-[electrical ringing]

12:06.642 --> 12:10.271
-[buzzer ringing]
-[kids chattering outside]

12:11.230 --> 12:12.356
[man] I'm headed to Brooklyn.

12:12.440 --> 12:16.277
-You need me to take care of anything?
-Right. Uh, no. Thanks, I'm good.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.028
[man] Sure? Take out the garbage?

12:18.863 --> 12:21.407
-Okay. As long as you're here.
-[man] Okay.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.995
You know, David, you've been
my tenant for three months.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.371
You don't have to be so formal.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.665
You can just come in through
the basement stairs.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.418
-No, I don't wanna startle ya.
-[bottles clinking]

12:32.501 --> 12:34.503
It's dark in here.
Do the bulbs need changing?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.298
-I like it dim.
-Okay.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.301
Oh, Halloween tonight.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.762
How do we do it without you going outside?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.722
You want me to get some candy?

12:44.805 --> 12:46.307
I'm not going to give out candy.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.601
I'm going to turn the lights out
and pretend I'm not home.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.733
We could just get a bowl of candy
and leave it on the porch, like…

12:56.567 --> 13:00.154
Any kid would take it within a minute
and then they'd take the bowl.

13:00.237 --> 13:03.449
Why don't we get a bowl of apples?
'Cause kids won't take apples.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.576
Then what's the point?

13:09.455 --> 13:11.040
Yeah. Okay.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.126
Have a nice time.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.337
Sure. Happy Halloween.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.339
[door closes]

13:18.422 --> 13:21.133
[woman on TV] Let your mind
go back to your childhood.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.468
-Was it happy?
-[buzzer rings]

13:22.551 --> 13:25.471
-Whom did you know in your childhood?
-[buzzer rings]

13:26.764 --> 13:28.682
[man] I'm haunted but I… [sighs]

13:29.433 --> 13:31.268
-I can't see by what.
-[thud]

13:31.352 --> 13:32.895
-[gasps]
-It's no use.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.396
[woman] You lived somewhere.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.731
-You had a mother.
-[thud]

13:35.815 --> 13:37.483
You were loved, you had friends.

13:37.566 --> 13:38.484
[man] Yes.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.573
[suspenseful music playing]

13:46.492 --> 13:48.452
[creaking]

13:48.953 --> 13:50.079

13:50.162 --> 13:50.996

-[gasps]

14:08.013 --> 14:08.848
[door thuds]

14:12.059 --> 14:13.811
Get away from my house!

14:13.894 --> 14:15.062
[thuds]

14:15.938 --> 14:18.774
[kids shouting and laughing]

14:18.858 --> 14:19.817
-[kid] Right there!
-Hey!

14:19.900 --> 14:21.735
-[kid] Get her!
-[gasps]

14:22.403 --> 14:24.363
[tense music playing]

14:24.446 --> 14:26.156
[breathing heavily]

14:29.618 --> 14:32.913
[kids clamoring outside]

14:39.336 --> 14:41.422
-This is my house.
-[kid] Get her!

14:41.505 --> 14:43.090
[gasping]

14:43.173 --> 14:45.509
[tense music growing louder]

14:45.593 --> 14:48.012
[breathing heavily]

14:58.314 --> 15:00.316
[tense music swelling]

15:01.650 --> 15:03.569
[gasping heavily]

15:04.570 --> 15:06.447
[tense music fades away]

15:07.948 --> 15:08.908
Hey.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.494
You're gonna have to convince me
I don't need to call an ambulance.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.121
[Anna] No, don't do that.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.790
Okay, you know who you are?
You know what day it is?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.502
Yeah, I'm Anna. It's Halloween.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.754
Okay, how many fingers?

15:22.588 --> 15:23.547
Three.

15:23.631 --> 15:27.051
Okay. You're all right.
You're gonna be all right. Just…

15:27.551 --> 15:28.761
breathing would be good.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.639
I was headed across the street

15:31.722 --> 15:33.599
when those little shits
started chucking eggs,

15:33.682 --> 15:35.142
and, oof, you went down hard.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.310
You're Jane Russell.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.313
What makes you say that?

15:40.314 --> 15:42.608
[Anna] Your… your son came by.

15:43.108 --> 15:43.984
Ethan.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.195
[Jane]
Sit up in case you got a concussion.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.365
-[faucet runs]
-[Jane] Jesus, it's dark in here.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.033
Do you faint a lot?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.577
I didn't faint.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.788
I mean, it's… like fainting.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.666
-[Jane pours drink]
-I can't go outside.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.418
Um… you didn't go outside.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.421
-No, I get panic attacks.
-Who doesn't?

16:04.505 --> 16:06.590
Here. Have some of this brandy, please.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.717
Uh, I'm agoraphobic.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.721
I can't go outside.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.392
Oh! Oh. [chuckles]

16:16.475 --> 16:19.144
You're stuck inside this shitty house.
Oh. [clicks tongue]

16:19.228 --> 16:22.481
Oh, man. I'd hate to be stuck
inside a house this shitty.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.274
[muffled thud]

16:24.358 --> 16:26.068
Is that your husband coming home?

16:27.027 --> 16:28.696
It's my tenant.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.990
He lives in the basement.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.619
So, um, what do you do all day?

16:35.703 --> 16:37.037
I mean, do you work?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.794
Oh, God, I'm so fucking nosy.

16:43.877 --> 16:47.506
I… I should just go. Um--

16:47.589 --> 16:49.466
-Do you want me to go?
-No.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.218
Um…

16:51.301 --> 16:52.553
No, it's…

16:52.636 --> 16:54.346
It's all right. I'm fine.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.598
I… counsel people.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.058
You counsel people?

16:58.642 --> 17:01.020
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, you're a shrink.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.522
Oh! [chuckles] That's a twist.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.026
You married?

17:08.068 --> 17:09.361
-Separated.
-Ah.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.196
And kids?

17:12.239 --> 17:15.034
My daughter Olivia is with her father.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.869
Oh, that's tough.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.328
Yeah.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.290
Yeah. Separated from your kid,
that's really tough.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.959
I talk to them every day.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.420
Yeah, it's just… It's--

17:27.337 --> 17:29.965
It's not the same as them
being here, though, is it?

17:33.177 --> 17:34.553
Take another drink, please.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.521
-Do you wanna go outside?
-You know, I have a shrink of my own.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.775
[laughing] Okay. Okay. I get it. I get it.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.569
All right, sorry. That sounds very wise.

17:50.652 --> 17:51.653
Yeah.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.948
I get it. [chuckles]

17:56.408 --> 17:57.242
Yeah.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.660
Yeah.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.498
We've been trying to get me
to go outside using an umbrella.

18:02.581 --> 18:03.665
Uh-huh.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.960
I haven't… been able to do it yet.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.378
Oh. [smacks lips]

18:08.879 --> 18:09.755
You will.

18:10.672 --> 18:11.507
You will.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.716
You'll figure it out.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.010
-[pops cork]
-[Jane] Notice I'm not asking

18:15.094 --> 18:17.179
-what made you this way.
-[Anna] What way?

18:17.262 --> 18:18.388
Agoraphobic.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.391
I have anxiety. I have…

18:22.059 --> 18:23.811
an anxiety disorder.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.230
-Punch. [clicking tongue] Punch.
-So, um…

18:26.313 --> 18:28.273
-[camera clicks]
-Good boy.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.109
That's what all these pills are for?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.235
-[Anna] Mm-hmm.
-Huh.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.779
So, what does… what does this one do?

18:33.862 --> 18:35.072
This, uh, pink one.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.573
Uh, that's Inderal.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.617
Ah. Beta blocker.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.785
How do you know that?

18:39.868 --> 18:42.121
Um, 'cause it says so on the bottle.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.456
[both chuckle]

18:45.207 --> 18:47.793
Pretty sure you're not supposed to be…
taking these with alcohol.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.378
[Anna] Mm.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.548
[inhales deeply]

18:53.674 --> 18:55.092
Thank you for the candle.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.428
Ethan brought it by. Thanks.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.722
Oh. Wow, okay, subject change.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.141
[clicks tongue] Uh-uh.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.725
I think I hurt my neck.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.978
-[both chuckle]
-He's a nice boy.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.025
-Look.
-Oh, what a cutie.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.152
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.155
He's my guy. My little baby guy.

19:16.655 --> 19:21.160
You know, when you have a kid,
you say, "He's my kid, my guy,"

19:21.243 --> 19:23.495
Like he's yours, like he belongs to you.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.248
-That's not really how it feels.
-You belong to them.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.332
Right.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.418
Right.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.003
You belong to them.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.088
And maybe you never belonged
to anybody before.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.383
I mean, maybe, maybe you thought
you belonged to your parents.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.094
You grew out of that. You certainly
didn't belong to your husband.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.597
Then this kid comes along,
and he's just got you.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.851
[laughs] I don't have to tell you that.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.984
[Jane sips drink]

19:56.987 --> 19:58.071
I like your earrings.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.949
Oh. Oh, thanks, yeah. A gift.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.619
They're a gift from an old boyfriend.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.953
Does your husband mind?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.455
I doubt he knows.

20:07.497 --> 20:10.000
[both laugh]

20:10.083 --> 20:11.501
He has trust issues.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.628
Oh, why is that?

20:12.711 --> 20:14.671
-Oh, I don't know.
-You don't know? Mmm.

20:14.755 --> 20:18.300
No. Come on, no, no.
I don't know. I don't know.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.177
-No, it's… [clears throat]
-Hmm.

20:20.260 --> 20:24.223
[sucks teeth] Who knows
why he has them? Um…

20:24.765 --> 20:27.184
He's a good guy, he's a good father.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.310
He's just, you know…

20:29.186 --> 20:30.938
-He's tight.
-[Anna] Mm.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.397
Controlling, and like…

20:33.649 --> 20:37.152
I have my own issues,
but I work through them and…

20:37.236 --> 20:38.528
I can handle them.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.073
Maybe sometimes I have to…

20:42.032 --> 20:43.617
get in between them and I--

20:44.534 --> 20:46.536
I worry about Ethan, 'cause…

20:47.579 --> 20:48.747
he's sensitive.

21:00.008 --> 21:00.926
Family's…

21:01.510 --> 21:02.803
complicated.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.304
[paper rustling]

21:04.388 --> 21:06.139
[scratching on paper]

21:07.057 --> 21:09.142
Why is your family complicated?

21:14.606 --> 21:17.025
-[Jane] Look.
-Oh, wow! That's amazing!

21:17.109 --> 21:19.486
Yeah. Jane Russell original.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.946
[Jane chuckles]

21:21.029 --> 21:23.282
-See how I changed the subject on you?
-I did.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.534
Yeah, you don't know
who you're fooling with.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.662
[both laughing]

21:29.162 --> 21:33.292
-[laughter]
-[indistinct conversation]

22:09.244 --> 22:10.871
[intercom buzzer rings]

22:11.371 --> 22:12.539
[Anna] Hello?

22:12.622 --> 22:14.708
Uh, it's Alistair Russell.

22:14.791 --> 22:17.961
We-we-we we moved in
just across the street. 101.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.881
-[buzzer sounds]
-[Anna] Push the door.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.350
I… I'm sorry to bother you.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.894
I just wanted to know…

22:33.977 --> 22:38.774
Well, I'm just curious if any of my family
has come around to see you this evening.

22:41.109 --> 22:41.985
No.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.198
Oh.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.117
No, I-- I've been alone.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.121
[softly stomps]

22:53.205 --> 22:54.539
Okay, thanks.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.125
Sorry to bother you.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.087
Thank your wife.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.256
For the candle. Ethan brought it over.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.133
Days ago.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.097
Good.

[Anna gasps]

[suspenseful music playing]

23:45.006 --> 23:47.884
-[breathing shakily]
-[phone line ringing]

23:52.973 --> 23:54.975
[dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency?

23:55.058 --> 23:57.227
[Anna] I think there's somebody
in my house.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.396
What's your address, ma'am?

23:59.479 --> 24:03.483
It's 104, West 121st Street.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.862
-[screams] I'm sorry.
-[man] Whoa!

24:06.945 --> 24:08.780
-It's David.
-[dispatcher] Ma'am, are you okay?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.949
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.701
-Ma'am?
-Yeah, I know him.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.661
It's a false alarm. I'm sorry.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.746
I-- I buzzed.
I did buzz half an hour ago.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.249
[sighing heavily]

24:20.041 --> 24:22.210
And I cleaned the eggs
off your front porch.

24:23.336 --> 24:24.796
What are you looking for?

24:24.880 --> 24:27.924
A guy across the street
asked me to help him open some boxes,

24:28.008 --> 24:29.176
store some stuff.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.720
I thought you might have a box cutter.

24:31.803 --> 24:35.432
I didn't know you were a handyman.
I thought you were a singer-songwriter.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.892
Which is why I am a handyman.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.643
[chuckles]

24:44.900 --> 24:46.485
You know you've got mold?

24:46.568 --> 24:47.861
Yeah, I do.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.741
[groans]

24:54.117 --> 24:55.744
David, come back inside!

24:58.538 --> 24:59.539
David?

25:01.875 --> 25:03.001
-Boo!
-[gasps]

25:03.084 --> 25:04.878
-Shit!
-[David laughing]

25:07.839 --> 25:11.176
[David] You're gonna need a pro
to seal that roof. It's dangerous.

25:11.259 --> 25:12.385
I'll call somebody.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.137
You okay?

25:14.221 --> 25:15.138
Yes.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.016
Who were you working with
across the street?

25:18.850 --> 25:19.768
Russell.

25:20.685 --> 25:21.561
You know him?

25:23.230 --> 25:24.439
How did he find you?

25:24.523 --> 25:25.899
I put up some flyers.

-Uh, yes.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.928

[Ethan] Hi. [groans softly]

26:04.354 --> 26:07.065
Is something going on over there?
I heard a scream.

26:07.148 --> 26:09.401
No, no. It's fine.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.529
I heard somebody scream. Was it you?

26:12.612 --> 26:14.197
No. [stifles sob]

26:14.281 --> 26:16.324
It's fine. [sobbing]

Are you okay?

26:44.978 --> 26:48.231
Hi, this is Anna Fox
from across the street.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.274
Yes?

26:49.774 --> 26:52.235
I… heard somebody scream just now.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.279
I wanted to call to check on…

26:54.362 --> 26:55.572
Sorry, you heard what?

26:56.823 --> 26:58.908
-A scream. A scream.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.910
Uh, a minute ago.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.329

27:04.497 --> 27:05.790
Yeah, from your house.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.126
Sorry, the only people here
are me and my boy.

David?

27:43.995 --> 27:44.954
What's up?

27:45.038 --> 27:46.414
Did you hear that scream

27:46.498 --> 27:47.540
-across the street?
-No.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.958
Now. Five minutes ago.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.293
I was listening to music.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.045
You didn't hear anybody scream?

27:52.128 --> 27:54.464
-I didn't hear anyone scream.

Are you?

[exhales]

28:50.687 --> 28:52.439
Ethan, what's going on over there?

28:53.940 --> 28:55.150
He's not a bad guy.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.236
He has a lot of stress.
It builds up in him and has to get it out.

28:58.319 --> 28:59.779
-It's all right.
-It's not all right.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.948
Stop saying it's all right.
It's clearly not all right.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.201
I've gotta go home.
I should not have come over.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.578
I'm sorry. I just…

29:19.382 --> 29:20.341
[Ethan] I'm sorry.

29:20.842 --> 29:21.968
It's okay.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.930
Why are you so nice to me?

29:26.890 --> 29:28.725
Because children need protection.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.312
[sneezes] Sorry. The cat.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.189
[Punch meows]

I want you to take my number.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.946
Is your mom okay?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.324
[Ethan] Yeah, I… I guess so.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.494
I mean, she has to take his side.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.620
[Anna] Okay. Um…

29:49.454 --> 29:50.580
All right, look.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.292
Ethan?

29:56.878 --> 30:00.465
Look, Ethan, um,
whatever is going on over there…

30:00.548 --> 30:02.258
no matter how bad it gets…

30:02.342 --> 30:03.635
this is a safe place.

30:05.678 --> 30:06.930
You can always come here.

30:08.598 --> 30:09.891
Always.

30:09.974 --> 30:10.809
Yeah.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.116
[Anna] You never know
what the right thing is to do.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.160
You want to call
Children's Protective Services,

30:29.244 --> 30:30.954
it's my word against the father's.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.247
-[man] Want advice?
-[Anna] No.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.207
[man] Don't go look
into other people's houses.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.125
[Anna] Karl says curiosity is healthy.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.378
[man] You said he was getting off
on controlling you.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.964
[Anna] You said we could talk
whenever I wanted to.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.298
[pills rattle]

30:44.342 --> 30:46.052
[Karl] Everything okay, Anna?

30:46.135 --> 30:47.053
[Anna] What's up?

30:47.554 --> 30:48.888
[Karl] You left a message.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.599
-No, I don't think so.
-[chuckles]

30:51.683 --> 30:54.811
If I knew how to work my phone
I could play it back for you.

30:56.646 --> 30:57.814
What are you doing?

30:58.314 --> 30:59.440
[indistinct chatter]

30:59.524 --> 31:01.651
[Anna] I'm watching David leave the house.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.945
[Karl] Looks like fun, right?

31:04.612 --> 31:06.239
Looks like he's escaping.

31:06.322 --> 31:08.324
I'm gonna give you another number, Anna.

31:08.408 --> 31:12.370

31:40.773 --> 31:43.151
[man on TV] Is that why
you visit murder trials?

31:43.234 --> 31:44.068
No.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.780
I went because your case
was like my father's.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.325
I know he didn't kill my stepmother.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.659
I know he told the truth.

She is across the street. And…

[man] Hello.

37:57.858 --> 38:00.611
[breathing heavily]

38:01.821 --> 38:05.366
Detective Little. NYPD. I was hoping
I could ask you some questions.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.034
What are you doing in my house?

38:07.118 --> 38:09.245
I understand you have
a tenant downstairs. He home?

38:09.328 --> 38:10.371
I… I don't know.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.956
-That your daughter?
-Is she here?

38:12.039 --> 38:14.458
She's with her father.
What happened to Jane?

38:15.418 --> 38:16.252
Hi.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.254
[gasps] Whoa. Uh…

38:18.754 --> 38:20.339
-What is this?
-Ma'am, you all right?

38:21.132 --> 38:22.842
No, why is he here?

38:22.925 --> 38:25.177
Mr. Russell believes
that you made a mistake…

38:25.261 --> 38:26.762
You have never met my wife.

38:27.722 --> 38:30.433
She helped me one night.
We spent the evening together.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.310
No, no. No, I don't think so.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.438
In fact, he came here looking for her.

38:35.521 --> 38:38.316
I was looking for my son, not my wife.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.067
You told me no one had been here.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.027
I lied.

38:41.777 --> 38:42.778
We played gin.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.614
-Why would you lie about that?
-Why would you lie about that?

38:45.698 --> 38:47.366
I was afraid that you would punish her.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.701
For playing gin?

38:48.784 --> 38:49.910
It doesn't matter.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.829
The point is, Dr. Fox,
that nothing's happened.

38:51.912 --> 38:52.830
-No.
-Hmm?

38:52.913 --> 38:54.248
No! I know what I saw!

38:54.332 --> 38:57.376
-Nothing's happened to anyone.
-No, I was zoomed in with the camera.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.878
-Did you take a picture?
-I did not!

38:58.961 --> 39:00.838
She's just admitted
she's spying on our house.

39:00.921 --> 39:02.673
-Mr. Russell…
-Why didn't you take a picture?

39:02.757 --> 39:05.634
The important thing is,
is that everybody's okay, yeah?

39:25.946 --> 39:27.323
I'm Jane Russell.

39:29.241 --> 39:30.284
She's not Jane.

39:32.995 --> 39:34.038
I promise I am.

39:34.955 --> 39:35.956
No, you're not Jane.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.958
She's not Jane. I know Jane.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.168
Jane's been in my house.

39:39.251 --> 39:40.378
This is absurd.

39:40.961 --> 39:41.879
That's Jane Russell.

39:42.838 --> 39:43.923
Get Ethan.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.596
Are you okay, Dr. Fox?

[breathes shakily]

39:55.768 --> 39:56.769
Tell them.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.898
You've never met my mother.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.200
Well, this has been great fun.

40:11.283 --> 40:13.911
[uneasy music continues]

40:15.287 --> 40:16.997
See you at the block party.

40:22.128 --> 40:25.214
You made a 911 call yesterday
about an intruder in your house?

40:25.714 --> 40:26.799
No.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.343
I mean, yes. But that was a mistake.

40:29.885 --> 40:32.012
It's a criminal offense
to make false police reports.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.931
Thank you, Detective.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.476
Am I okay to leave you alone, Dr. Fox?

40:38.936 --> 40:41.647
Look, you need anything,
you, um, you call me.

40:42.189 --> 40:43.732
Day or night. Hmm?

40:43.816 --> 40:45.693
I have four kids.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.945
I don't sleep. [chuckles]

Not record it for posterity.
Are you doubting me, too?

41:11.969 --> 41:13.929
-[man] I'm on your side.
-You don't sound like it.

41:14.013 --> 41:17.057
-Understandable they don't believe you.
-[Anna] Because I didn't take a picture?

41:17.141 --> 41:20.227
[man] Because you're not healthy.
And I'm not sure you're getting better.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.574
Hi, Shelly.
I'm trying to reach Alistair Russell

42:15.658 --> 42:17.868
and Joan said that I should speak to you.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.036
He doesn't work here.

42:19.119 --> 42:22.206
-I thought he transferred to Manhattan.
-Yes, but not with us.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.501
Oh, he left Atkinson?

42:25.584 --> 42:28.671
[sighs] You could try calling Boston.
I really don't know much about it.

42:29.755 --> 42:32.007
Well, it couldn't have
happened very long ago.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.426
You're gonna wanna call Boston.

You'd have to call New York.

that I, uh, call up there.

What was her job title?

an executive assistant.

I see here I have an address.
I know he transferred to Manhattan.

44:33.671 --> 44:34.630
[Steve] Yeah.

44:34.713 --> 44:37.758
I know that he moved shortly
after Miss Nazin's passing.

then why are you asking?

I'm just not made that way.

-I can't help you if you don't tell.
-You never met my mother!

You were lying and you know it.

-You're just confused.
-No, I know what I saw.

You don't. You're just wrong.

-We talked about you.

-She told me about you!
-Don't do this!

Why are you lying for him?

Ethan.

You cannot slap that boy.

52:54.045 --> 52:57.340
I've put up with a lot, Mrs. Fox,
all of us have, but this…

52:57.424 --> 52:59.176
this stops now.

52:59.676 --> 53:02.179
Your relationship with Ethan,
it's inappropriate.

53:02.262 --> 53:03.972
He's a young man! He's a…

53:04.055 --> 53:06.683
He's a boy! He's 15-and-a-half

53:06.766 --> 53:08.768
and you're a mature woman!

53:08.852 --> 53:12.022
And of course, you're completely
out of your goddamn mind!

53:12.105 --> 53:13.773
[nervously] I'll call the police!

53:13.857 --> 53:15.233
Go. Go ahead.

53:15.317 --> 53:17.527
Go ahead. I'm sure they'd love
hearing from you.

53:17.611 --> 53:21.907
A-- A drunken, shut-in,
pill-popping cat lady!

53:24.159 --> 53:24.993
You…

53:26.494 --> 53:28.705
You're fucking with the wrong family.

53:30.790 --> 53:35.295
-Stay away from my son!

54:56.501 --> 54:58.044
There you are. That's your little kitty.

54:58.545 --> 55:01.464
And there's her little nose.
And all the beautiful flowers.

55:01.548 --> 55:03.091
It's beautiful. It's hopeful.

You got something in your foot, huh?

56:03.318 --> 56:05.737
-[purring]
-You got something in there?

56:05.820 --> 56:08.990
Punch, what is it? Huh?

56:09.074 --> 56:10.158
It's okay.

56:33.014 --> 56:35.016
You don't have any idea
who could've sent you this?

56:35.100 --> 56:38.311
No, the only person
who has a key is my tenant, David.

56:38.395 --> 56:39.479
Yeah, where is he?

56:39.562 --> 56:40.897
I don't know.

56:40.980 --> 56:43.400
-Are you having problems with David?
-No. I mean, no. I…

56:43.483 --> 56:45.944
-[Norelli] Nothing up here.
-You see, coast is clear.

56:46.027 --> 56:48.113
-Can you track the email?
-Track it?

56:48.196 --> 56:50.365
-Or trace it? Whatever.
-You can't track a Gmail account.

56:50.448 --> 56:52.784
-You could've sent this to yourself.
-I'm sleeping.

56:52.867 --> 56:55.954
-Or you wanted to look asleep.
-[Anna] I'm asleep. What the hell?

56:56.037 --> 56:58.248
-[buzzer ringing]
-Dr. Fox, there is no sign…

56:58.331 --> 57:00.792
that anyone has been here, okay?
Nothing is missing.

57:00.875 --> 57:04.421
-[Norelli] Doors and windows look okay.
-Someone has been in my house.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.131
-I have given you proof.
-[door opens]

57:06.214 --> 57:08.425
[Alistair] She called my office in Boston!

57:08.508 --> 57:11.678
-Did you know that? She's called my house!
-[Little] Damn it! Mr. Russell.

57:11.761 --> 57:12.720
Why were you fired?

57:12.804 --> 57:14.431
-She spies on our house!
-All right.

57:14.514 --> 57:16.683
She lured my son into her home!

57:16.766 --> 57:17.851
He is abusive.

57:17.934 --> 57:20.061
She is harassing my son.
She is harassing my--

57:20.145 --> 57:22.147
He hit his son. I saw him hit his son.

57:22.230 --> 57:23.314
She's delusional.

57:23.398 --> 57:25.692
Ethan told me, Jane told me,
I saw him do it.

57:25.775 --> 57:28.278
-Um…
-She is Jane!

57:29.612 --> 57:32.657
You are a drunk and a drug addict
and you made it all up!

57:32.740 --> 57:35.452
You almost had me believing that
and then I found this.

57:36.911 --> 57:37.745
What's this?

57:37.829 --> 57:40.623
This is a picture that
your wife drew and signed.

57:41.374 --> 57:44.043
And you call me delusional,
you motherfucker.

57:44.127 --> 57:46.045
-[Norelli] Hey, hey!
-It's you.

57:47.213 --> 57:48.214
She was here.

57:49.090 --> 57:51.468
-That proves it.
-[Alistair] That doesn't prove anything.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.970
That proves you're out of your mind.

57:54.554 --> 57:55.638
What's happening?

57:58.266 --> 57:59.184
Door was open.

58:00.226 --> 58:02.353
-Who are you?
-[David] I live downstairs.

58:02.437 --> 58:05.315
It's my tenant. That's David.

58:05.398 --> 58:09.277
-[Norelli] Got a last name, David?
-No. Just David. Like Sting.

58:09.360 --> 58:12.363
It's Winters. His last name is Winters.

58:12.447 --> 58:15.033
It's just Winter, actually. Singular.

58:15.116 --> 58:16.993
Where were you last night, Mr. Winters?

58:18.411 --> 58:20.622
In Connecticut. On a job. Why?

58:20.705 --> 58:22.624
Somebody took a photo
of Dr. Fox in her sleep…

58:22.707 --> 58:25.043
around 2:00 a.m.
and then e-mailed it to her.

58:25.627 --> 58:26.544
Someone broke in?

58:27.337 --> 58:28.755
How do we know it was last night?

58:28.838 --> 58:30.924
Can anyone confirm
you were in Connecticut last night?

58:31.007 --> 58:33.426
Yeah. The lady I was with.

58:33.510 --> 58:34.552
I'm gonna need her number.

58:35.970 --> 58:38.640
You can call her. Her name is Elizabeth.

58:38.723 --> 58:41.893
Dr. Fox says she saw a woman
assaulted in Mr. Russell's house.

58:42.477 --> 58:44.312
You know anything about that?

58:44.395 --> 58:46.648
-No.
-Have you ever met Mrs. Russell?

58:47.232 --> 58:48.441
No.

58:48.525 --> 58:53.112
Her earring is beside your bed
on your nightstand, that little rose.

58:53.196 --> 58:54.572
Jane Russell's earring.

58:54.656 --> 58:56.574
What were you doing
in your tenant's bedroom?

58:59.327 --> 59:01.412
She has some serious privacy issues.

59:01.496 --> 59:03.915
[oppressive music plays]

59:03.998 --> 59:05.959
Well… how do you do?

59:07.210 --> 59:10.129
That earring belongs to a woman I know.

59:10.213 --> 59:12.090
And who is that woman?

59:12.173 --> 59:13.633
Her name is Katherine.

59:14.175 --> 59:15.927
She spent the night here last week.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.889
You took a box cutter from me.

59:20.473 --> 59:21.599
You loaned it to me.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.893
Checks out. He was in Darien last night.

59:27.063 --> 59:29.899
He was in prison for assault.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.694
He was in prison.
He shouldn't be in New York.

59:32.777 --> 59:36.489
He's been in her house.
He must have met her.

59:37.282 --> 59:43.705
Her earring is beside his bed
and he borrowed a knife from me,

59:43.788 --> 59:45.331
and he's been in prison.

59:47.625 --> 59:51.004
And he was fired from his job.

59:52.171 --> 59:53.756
His assistant died.

59:56.050 --> 59:57.802
He threatened me.

59:57.885 --> 59:59.345
In my home.

1:00:00.763 --> 1:00:02.015
He beats his child.

1:00:02.557 --> 1:00:03.891
I'm a child psychologist.

1:00:03.975 --> 1:00:07.604
I know how to identify
a child who's in danger,

1:00:07.687 --> 1:00:08.938
who's being abused.

1:00:09.022 --> 1:00:13.610
And I saw Alistair slap Ethan
in my home yesterday.

1:00:15.695 --> 1:00:16.988
Wait-- W--

1:00:17.947 --> 1:00:19.824
Yes, yes. Yesterday.

1:00:22.493 --> 1:00:23.411
I see…

1:00:24.787 --> 1:00:27.123
I see the way
that you're all looking at me.

1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:30.752
I'm not crazy.

1:00:31.836 --> 1:00:34.756
I'm not hallucinating.
Do I seem unreasonable?

1:00:36.299 --> 1:00:37.467
I have evidence.

1:00:38.426 --> 1:00:42.430
There was that picture
that Jane drew and she signed,

1:00:42.513 --> 1:00:45.725
and there's a photograph
that somebody took of me

1:00:45.808 --> 1:00:47.060
while I was sleeping.

1:00:48.353 --> 1:00:51.481
Look, it doesn't matter
what you think about me,

1:00:51.564 --> 1:00:55.109
if you approve of me,
if you think that I'm reliable.

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:59.113
There is a boy in danger in that house.

1:00:59.197 --> 1:01:00.782
Just help him, please.

1:01:00.865 --> 1:01:03.159
[delicate music plays faintly]

1:01:03.242 --> 1:01:04.160
You're a father.

1:01:06.204 --> 1:01:08.998
I would think that you would want
to help a child.

1:01:10.833 --> 1:01:12.335
If my husband were here…

1:01:13.628 --> 1:01:14.671
he would help.

1:01:15.922 --> 1:01:17.465
He would believe me.

1:01:17.548 --> 1:01:20.510
[Norelli] Dr. Fox, your family is dead.

1:01:20.593 --> 1:01:23.680
I don't know how
you can live with yourself

1:01:23.763 --> 1:01:27.684
if you let something happen to a child.

1:01:30.478 --> 1:01:33.481
[Norelli] I'm sorry,
but your family is dead.

1:01:43.366 --> 1:01:45.201
[Olivia] They look like a giant's bed.

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:52.500
That one looks like a horse.

1:01:52.583 --> 1:01:54.460
What would you name a horse if we got one?

1:01:55.294 --> 1:01:56.337
I'd call him Vixen.

1:01:56.421 --> 1:01:58.131
A vixen is a fox.

1:01:59.882 --> 1:02:01.634
It's a girl fox, sweetheart.

1:02:03.219 --> 1:02:04.971
[Olivia] What would you call
a horse, Mommy?

1:02:05.054 --> 1:02:06.556
"Of course, of course."

1:02:12.562 --> 1:02:14.439
It's an old TV show.

1:02:19.235 --> 1:02:20.403
I can't do it this way.

1:02:27.618 --> 1:02:28.453
Do what?

1:02:31.330 --> 1:02:32.248
This.

1:02:32.915 --> 1:02:34.792
This happy family vacation.

1:02:36.461 --> 1:02:39.046
You and I spoke in painful detail

1:02:39.130 --> 1:02:42.925
and I thought that we agreed
that we would not ruin Christmas.

1:02:44.510 --> 1:02:46.929
And I can't do it anymore. I can't.

1:02:48.347 --> 1:02:50.308
The acting is foolish.

1:02:50.391 --> 1:02:52.143
It doesn't dignify our daughter.

1:02:53.936 --> 1:02:55.813
You don't care if she gets upset?

1:02:56.481 --> 1:02:58.941
She should be upset. It's upsetting.

1:03:03.112 --> 1:03:04.947
Well, don't blame me
if she's scarred for life.

1:03:06.324 --> 1:03:07.825
I do blame you.

1:03:07.909 --> 1:03:08.951
You're to blame.

I talked to your doctor, Dr. Landy.

1:06:19.141 --> 1:06:21.978
And you have had a hell of a time.

1:06:23.437 --> 1:06:26.440
And I think you actually believe
that you met this lady

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:28.943
just like how you believe
you're talking to your family.

1:06:30.778 --> 1:06:34.240
Your doctor said that your meds
can cause hallucinations.

1:07:20.536 --> 1:07:23.497
I'm so sorry
that I mixed Ethan up in this.

1:07:30.755 --> 1:07:32.214
I don't… I don't know…

1:07:35.092 --> 1:07:36.635
what you must think.

1:07:38.387 --> 1:07:39.346
All of you.

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:50.691
I understand…

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:54.236
if you want to recommend…

1:07:55.071 --> 1:07:56.322
supervision.

1:08:04.038 --> 1:08:05.122
[Karl] I'm listening.

1:08:10.419 --> 1:08:11.921
I've been slipping.

1:08:14.465 --> 1:08:16.342
Slipping on my meds.

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:18.886
Drinking.

1:08:20.971 --> 1:08:22.765
Getting into a really…

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:28.896
dark frame of mind
and I'm not sharing that with you.

1:08:36.529 --> 1:08:38.155
[Karl] That's a hard thing to admit.

1:08:41.992 --> 1:08:44.370
[voice breaking]
Well, it feels good to say. [sniffles]

1:08:45.663 --> 1:08:46.789
And to hear.

1:08:49.917 --> 1:08:52.461
I don't think that the Elevan
is good for me. [chuckles softly]

1:08:54.296 --> 1:08:55.297
[scoffs]

1:08:55.381 --> 1:08:57.925
-[laughs] No.
-Not if you're hallucinating, no.

1:08:58.008 --> 1:09:00.177
I wouldn't think, no, no. [sniffles]

1:09:00.886 --> 1:09:03.806
And there's some mania, too.

1:09:07.768 --> 1:09:12.273
I just really needed to be
at the center of something.

1:09:15.693 --> 1:09:17.278
I needed a wake-up call.

1:09:21.532 --> 1:09:24.410
You got very lucky with that detective.

1:09:26.078 --> 1:09:28.122
You realize how
this could've gone differently.

1:09:31.750 --> 1:09:33.460
I just wanna turn it around.

1:09:37.173 --> 1:09:38.883
I had no idea about David.

1:09:39.508 --> 1:09:41.635
Well, that was a mess.

1:09:41.719 --> 1:09:43.429
-Is he here?
-No, no.

1:09:43.512 --> 1:09:44.346
He's…

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:47.266
gonna come back this afternoon and…

1:09:48.517 --> 1:09:50.144
pick up the last of his stuff.

1:09:50.936 --> 1:09:52.897
Which leaves you here alone.

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:57.985
You don't think it's paranoid
if I wanna change the locks, do you?

1:09:58.068 --> 1:10:00.112
There's gonna have to be somebody here.

1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:05.117
And then you and I are gonna go back
to three sessions a week.

1:10:06.952 --> 1:10:07.786
Okay.

1:10:10.247 --> 1:10:13.042
[somber music playing]

1:11:34.248 --> 1:11:35.291
[camera beeps]

1:12:03.986 --> 1:12:05.195
I'm Anna Fox.

1:12:06.447 --> 1:12:08.824
Uh, today is, um…

1:12:09.533 --> 1:12:11.702
Monday. November 6th.

1:12:13.287 --> 1:12:14.872
And I'm making this video…

1:12:15.456 --> 1:12:16.540
[whispers] Making…

1:12:17.082 --> 1:12:18.334
[camera beeps]

1:12:18.417 --> 1:12:21.128
I'm Anna Fox, and I'm at 104…

1:12:21.879 --> 1:12:25.382
West 121st Street in Manhattan, New York.

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:29.595
And I am, uh, making this video…

1:12:30.387 --> 1:12:32.514
as my final will and testament.

1:12:33.307 --> 1:12:37.353
Randy Turo, that's a lawyer.

1:12:37.436 --> 1:12:39.104
He has a written will…

1:12:40.230 --> 1:12:42.149
that Ed and I did together.

1:12:43.817 --> 1:12:45.027
After, um…

1:12:46.445 --> 1:12:48.030
Olivia was born.

1:12:50.199 --> 1:12:51.283
And I'm not gonna be…

1:12:51.784 --> 1:12:54.286
making any, like,
super-significant changes…

1:12:54.828 --> 1:12:55.746
[laughs]

1:12:55.829 --> 1:12:57.706
Super… Super…

1:12:57.790 --> 1:12:59.416
-Fuck, really?
-[camera beeps]

1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:04.505
The point of me doing this
is that there's no, um…

1:13:06.048 --> 1:13:07.091
confusion…

1:13:08.384 --> 1:13:09.593
about, um,

1:13:09.676 --> 1:13:11.553
my soundness of mind.

1:13:16.308 --> 1:13:17.643
My state of mind.

1:13:17.726 --> 1:13:20.896
I-- I--
I especially wanna make sure that, um…

1:13:21.897 --> 1:13:23.649
that you know that David Winters

1:13:23.732 --> 1:13:26.944
has absolutely
nothing to do with my death.

1:13:27.027 --> 1:13:28.904
In fact, I'm waiting for him to come…

1:13:31.031 --> 1:13:32.991
to come and to get his stuff…

1:13:33.784 --> 1:13:35.202
so that I can, um…

1:13:39.832 --> 1:13:40.958
go through with it.

1:13:54.388 --> 1:13:56.181
Go through with it… [scoffs]

1:13:58.142 --> 1:14:00.310
I just wish I could be forgiven.

1:14:05.858 --> 1:14:06.859
I really…

1:14:08.235 --> 1:14:10.237
wish I could just be forgiven.

1:14:14.741 --> 1:14:16.243
I want to go back.

1:14:18.620 --> 1:14:20.581
I want to do it over.

1:14:24.293 --> 1:14:25.919
I want to do it different.

1:14:32.009 --> 1:14:32.926
And I can't.

1:14:36.972 --> 1:14:38.140
And I can't.

1:14:38.974 --> 1:14:41.810
[tense music slowly builds]

1:14:44.605 --> 1:14:45.731
[shouts] I can't!

-[camera clicks]

1:15:27.564 --> 1:15:29.775
-Punch. Punch.

[chuckles in relief]

1:15:43.747 --> 1:15:44.748
[whispering] Okay.

1:15:46.124 --> 1:15:47.042
[muffled thud]

1:15:48.085 --> 1:15:49.086
Hello?

1:15:49.169 --> 1:15:50.546
[rain pattering]

1:15:59.763 --> 1:16:00.889
Hello?

1:16:02.099 --> 1:16:02.975
[David] Sorry.

1:16:03.809 --> 1:16:07.062
Tried to call. I just need to get
my umbrella and my gloves.

1:16:07.145 --> 1:16:08.480
[Anna] Can you come up?

1:16:08.564 --> 1:16:09.982
Uh, just for a moment.

1:16:10.065 --> 1:16:11.275
[David] I'm soaking wet.

1:16:11.358 --> 1:16:13.193
I had a long day
and it's not about to end soon.

1:16:13.277 --> 1:16:15.362
[Anna] Please. It'll just take a minute.

1:16:15.445 --> 1:16:17.447
[footsteps walking up stairs]

1:16:27.874 --> 1:16:28.792
[Anna gasps]

1:16:30.127 --> 1:16:31.211
Thank you.

1:16:31.295 --> 1:16:32.296
For what?

1:16:33.130 --> 1:16:34.214
[chuckles softly]

1:16:36.383 --> 1:16:38.552
I wanna show you…

1:16:38.635 --> 1:16:39.595
a picture.

1:16:44.808 --> 1:16:45.976
[David sighs]

1:16:53.317 --> 1:16:54.693
The face in the wine glass.

1:16:56.778 --> 1:16:57.779
Yeah, I see it.

1:16:58.947 --> 1:17:00.907
[chuckles softly]

1:17:00.991 --> 1:17:02.909
That is the woman that I saw murdered.

1:17:02.993 --> 1:17:05.078
She said that her name was Jane Russell!

1:17:10.584 --> 1:17:12.669
Her name is Katie.

1:17:13.253 --> 1:17:14.630
[tense music plays]

1:17:14.713 --> 1:17:15.547
What?

1:17:16.506 --> 1:17:18.008
Ethan, the son…

1:17:18.925 --> 1:17:20.135
she is the birth mother.

1:17:23.096 --> 1:17:24.556
You spent the night with her.

1:17:25.098 --> 1:17:26.725
Wednesday. One night.

1:17:27.267 --> 1:17:29.853
She was a total disaster.
Why do you think I bailed?

1:17:30.437 --> 1:17:33.106
I spent the night on a couch in Astoria
on Thursday night

1:17:33.190 --> 1:17:34.816
just so I don't have
to run into her again.

1:17:35.525 --> 1:17:38.153
She ran away on him
when she was eight months pregnant.

1:17:38.236 --> 1:17:40.822
Disappeared.
Alistair spent two years chasing her down…

1:17:40.906 --> 1:17:42.574
and found her in some Oregon meth commune.

1:17:42.658 --> 1:17:44.660
He took the boy, she went to prison.

1:17:44.743 --> 1:17:46.912
-See how I changed the subject on you?
-I did.

1:17:46.995 --> 1:17:49.456
You don't know who you're fooling with.
[laughing]

1:17:52.376 --> 1:17:53.627
They told you this?

1:17:53.710 --> 1:17:56.129
She did. She wouldn't shut up.

1:17:56.213 --> 1:17:59.675
They've been hiding from her for years.
She found out they were living in Boston.

1:17:59.758 --> 1:18:01.385
He's been paying her to stay away.

1:18:02.177 --> 1:18:04.471
Why did she tell me
her name is Jane Russell?

1:18:04.554 --> 1:18:05.597
You're Jane Russell.

1:18:05.681 --> 1:18:06.723
You're Jane Russell.

1:18:07.516 --> 1:18:08.892
What makes you say that?

1:18:08.975 --> 1:18:11.478
[Anna] Your son came by. Ethan.

1:18:13.647 --> 1:18:14.898
I saw her murdered.

1:18:16.274 --> 1:18:17.776
[thunder rumbles]

1:18:17.859 --> 1:18:19.611
Whatever you say, Anna.

1:18:19.695 --> 1:18:20.612
Yeah.

1:18:22.406 --> 1:18:24.616
I showed you… the picture.

1:18:25.617 --> 1:18:28.036
Yeah, looking very much alive.

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:29.329
She's real.

1:18:30.539 --> 1:18:33.834
And I need you
to go to the police with me.

1:18:34.334 --> 1:18:35.627
[sighs]

1:18:38.171 --> 1:18:39.297
No.

1:18:39.381 --> 1:18:40.590
No, no.

1:18:40.674 --> 1:18:41.550
David!

1:18:42.342 --> 1:18:44.553
You can't just run away from this!

1:18:45.387 --> 1:18:46.430
[David] Watch me.

1:18:46.513 --> 1:18:48.223
Oh, shit! Please, David!

Oh, my God!

You know what's so great about this?

1:19:39.107 --> 1:19:41.735
Everyone thinks
I'm in New Hampshire right now.

1:19:41.818 --> 1:19:45.113
They call it a wilderness program
but it's really a prison.

1:19:45.614 --> 1:19:47.407
I was supposed to go last month

1:19:47.491 --> 1:19:49.993
but they had a fire or something.
[chuckles softly]

1:19:52.662 --> 1:19:54.915
We never had a chance to say goodbye.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:56.666
David!

1:19:56.750 --> 1:19:59.961
The trick is to run away
before you get there.

1:20:00.045 --> 1:20:01.713
What did you do? [loudly] David!

1:20:01.797 --> 1:20:02.839
He's dead.

1:20:03.673 --> 1:20:04.674
You killed him.

1:20:04.758 --> 1:20:06.927
-No. What?
-It's your knife.

1:20:07.719 --> 1:20:10.597
Your house. Just the two of you.

1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:12.849
What did you do?

1:20:12.933 --> 1:20:14.351
He deserved it.

1:20:14.434 --> 1:20:17.229
He slept with my mom
and got her all pissed off.

1:20:17.312 --> 1:20:18.563
And then threw her out.

1:20:18.647 --> 1:20:20.023
[Anna whimpering]

1:20:20.106 --> 1:20:22.901
She might have just gone away
if he'd left her alone.

1:20:23.902 --> 1:20:25.821
Then maybe none of this
would have happened.

1:20:27.447 --> 1:20:29.324
-Don't scream, Anna.
-[gasps]

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:31.993
That'll just be bad for everyone.

1:20:34.287 --> 1:20:36.289
[breathes deeply]

1:20:36.373 --> 1:20:37.332
Take a deep breath.

1:20:37.415 --> 1:20:38.959
[gasping]

1:20:39.042 --> 1:20:41.002
That's what they're always
telling me to do.

1:20:41.086 --> 1:20:43.046
Self-management coping skills.

1:20:51.304 --> 1:20:52.764

1:20:53.640 --> 1:20:57.185
-Why are you so freaked out?
-[shuddering]

1:20:57.269 --> 1:20:58.937
You're killing yourself anyway, right?

1:21:00.897 --> 1:21:02.774
[tense music playing]

1:21:02.858 --> 1:21:04.317
No. No.

1:21:06.361 --> 1:21:09.030
I thought it was a really nice video.

1:21:11.074 --> 1:21:13.034
How did you get into my house?

1:21:13.994 --> 1:21:17.122
'Cause you're so vigilant about your keys.

1:21:17.205 --> 1:21:19.332
And sober. Right.

1:21:21.293 --> 1:21:23.003
I've been in here all week.

1:21:24.170 --> 1:21:25.672
You killed your mother.

1:21:32.178 --> 1:21:33.930
That bothers you, right?

1:21:35.473 --> 1:21:36.641
You feel for her?

1:21:38.476 --> 1:21:39.561
You and Katie…

1:21:40.770 --> 1:21:42.230
one job to do.

1:21:43.523 --> 1:21:45.692
One fucking thing.

1:21:48.236 --> 1:21:50.280
Take care of your family, right?

1:21:51.615 --> 1:21:52.616
Both of you.

1:21:54.075 --> 1:21:55.118
And what do you do?

1:21:56.828 --> 1:21:59.831
The real estate lady
who sold my dad the house,

1:21:59.915 --> 1:22:03.209
she talked about you and what happened.

1:22:04.044 --> 1:22:05.921
And I couldn't stop thinking

1:22:06.004 --> 1:22:09.174
what a perfect next person
you were for me.

1:22:10.717 --> 1:22:12.844
I knew exactly what you would like.

1:22:14.888 --> 1:22:17.098
Is that a talent or a skill…

1:22:17.849 --> 1:22:18.850
to know that…

1:22:20.727 --> 1:22:22.562
in your professional opinion?

1:22:26.149 --> 1:22:28.318
Okay, see? Now you don't like me anymore.

1:22:29.069 --> 1:22:31.321
Is that what happened in Boston…

1:22:32.405 --> 1:22:34.658
with you and Pam? She got sick of you?

1:22:37.035 --> 1:22:38.411
Pam liked everything I did.

1:22:38.495 --> 1:22:40.705
You don't seem very sure about it.

1:22:41.289 --> 1:22:42.791
She was just a place to start.

1:22:43.708 --> 1:22:45.001
I'm still figuring things out.

1:22:45.085 --> 1:22:47.545
-What does that mean?
-I don't have a pattern yet.

1:22:47.629 --> 1:22:49.464
-Pattern of?
-Of this!

1:22:50.340 --> 1:22:52.217
I have so many choices, right?

1:22:53.843 --> 1:22:56.137
What do I wanna be when I grow up?

1:22:57.681 --> 1:23:00.642
I know I like being there
when it happens, feeling it.

1:23:04.854 --> 1:23:07.857
Pam took about five minutes to die
after she hit the ground.

1:23:10.485 --> 1:23:12.404
If you hadn't found that picture of Katie,

1:23:12.487 --> 1:23:15.073
I was just gonna come in at the very end

1:23:15.156 --> 1:23:16.324
and say goodbye.

1:23:17.867 --> 1:23:19.953
You could pretend that I'm not even here.

1:23:22.288 --> 1:23:25.041
[breathes heavily]

1:23:25.125 --> 1:23:27.085
I just wanna watch you go.

1:23:30.547 --> 1:23:31.715
Okay.

1:23:34.843 --> 1:23:36.094
You know what, fuck it.

1:23:37.429 --> 1:23:38.471
You wanna watch?

1:23:40.557 --> 1:23:42.892
[tense music playing]

1:23:48.314 --> 1:23:51.067
Because a world with you in it…

1:23:52.610 --> 1:23:54.154
where you exist…

1:23:55.572 --> 1:23:56.948
is a world of filth.

1:24:02.370 --> 1:24:03.538
No, I'm done.

1:24:03.621 --> 1:24:07.250
[tense music rising]

1:24:07.333 --> 1:24:09.169
[Ethan breathing heavily]

1:24:14.507 --> 1:24:16.676
I don't wanna breathe that air.

1:24:19.220 --> 1:24:21.264
[Ethan screaming]

1:24:22.182 --> 1:24:23.183

1:25:34.504 --> 1:25:35.505
Anna!

1:25:37.841 --> 1:25:39.717
Stop fighting me!

[frantic, chilling music playing]

-[gasps]
-You don't even wanna live anymore!

1:26:32.645 --> 1:26:35.523
You haven't wanted to live
for a long time!

1:26:36.107 --> 1:26:37.233
[gasping]

1:26:41.654 --> 1:26:43.406
[breathing heavily]

1:26:46.284 --> 1:26:47.702
Here we go!

1:26:49.537 --> 1:26:50.496
[Anna] No!

[morose music playing]

1:28:12.203 --> 1:28:13.037
[Little] Hey.

1:28:15.164 --> 1:28:17.083
Hey, I was just gonna leave a message.

1:28:21.129 --> 1:28:22.380
Were you here before?

1:28:22.463 --> 1:28:24.215
[Little] Yeah. And they, um…

1:28:24.299 --> 1:28:26.301
they told me not to wake you, so…

1:28:27.969 --> 1:28:28.803
Are you in pain?

1:28:30.638 --> 1:28:31.806
I should be, right?

1:28:31.889 --> 1:28:35.893
Hey, just don't stay on that shit too long
'cause it feels way too good.

1:28:38.771 --> 1:28:40.106
David's dead?

1:28:41.941 --> 1:28:42.859
Yeah.

1:28:44.736 --> 1:28:45.820
I'm sorry.

1:28:47.572 --> 1:28:49.657
But, uh, we have the Russells in custody.

1:28:50.325 --> 1:28:54.329
He isn't sayin' a word, but Jane,
she won't stop talking, so… [scoffs]

1:28:56.831 --> 1:28:58.624
We have Katherine Melli's body.

1:28:58.708 --> 1:29:00.626
We found it in Fort Lee.

1:29:02.545 --> 1:29:04.422
Means you were right
about everything you saw.

1:29:05.298 --> 1:29:08.426
And we messed up, and you're gonna get
a lot of apologies from a lot of people.

1:29:08.509 --> 1:29:11.304
And I just wanted
to be here to be the first.

1:29:13.473 --> 1:29:14.390
I'm sorry.

1:29:16.059 --> 1:29:17.018
Thank you.

1:29:23.232 --> 1:29:24.567
I saw your video.

1:29:32.742 --> 1:29:35.453
So, look, um, Detective Norelli,

1:29:35.995 --> 1:29:38.414
I hope you don't mind,
she's got Punch at her house.

1:29:38.498 --> 1:29:42.210
Whenever you're ready to get out of here,
she's happy to give her back--

1:29:42.293 --> 1:29:44.128
So, everybody's seen the video?

1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:48.800
At this point…

1:29:50.843 --> 1:29:51.677
no.

1:29:53.930 --> 1:29:55.223
No, no, no. Um…

1:29:56.182 --> 1:29:59.394
We're actually having a little trouble
locating the phone.

1:30:00.561 --> 1:30:04.357
Yeah, I think that somehow
the phone ended up here with you,

1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:07.985
and when I come back
and ask you about it in an hour…

1:30:10.405 --> 1:30:11.406
you hand it over.

1:30:14.033 --> 1:30:16.536
Get rid of anything on there
that you don't want out, okay?

1:30:19.372 --> 1:30:20.206
Really?

1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:26.129
Look, I messed up this case
so bad already.

1:30:26.212 --> 1:30:28.339
I don't think one more thing
is gonna hurt me, right?

1:30:29.257 --> 1:30:30.341
[Little chuckles softly]

1:30:37.807 --> 1:30:39.308
Just be straight up with me.

1:30:44.147 --> 1:30:46.232
I'm not gonna have
to worry about you, right?

1:30:48.276 --> 1:30:50.945
[soft, cordial music playing]

1:30:54.282 --> 1:30:55.199
Right.

1:31:29.275 --> 1:31:32.653
[slow evocative music playing]

1:31:58.304 --> 1:31:59.555
I have to go now.

1:32:01.140 --> 1:32:02.141
[sighs]

1:32:10.525 --> 1:32:11.609
I miss you.

1:32:52.066 --> 1:32:53.401
You ready?

1:32:53.484 --> 1:32:55.486
Huh? Hmm?

1:32:57.530 --> 1:32:59.198
-[meows]
-All right.

1:33:00.157 --> 1:33:01.784
Okay, it won't be long.

1:33:01.867 --> 1:33:05.538
-Come on, come on. Come.
-[purrs]

1:33:07.456 --> 1:33:08.291
