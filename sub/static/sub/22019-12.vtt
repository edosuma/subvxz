WEBVTT

00:22.820 --> 00:27.780
AAH! NO! NO!

00:27.820 --> 00:30.254
;_-,

00:30.290 --> 00:31.382
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

00:31.430 --> 00:32.522
LOUD.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.051
BUT IT HAD ITS PERKS.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.761
UM, I DIDN'T HAVE TO
SHARE A BEDROOM.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.461
BULLIES AT SCHOOL
DIDN'T MESS WITH ME.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.367
AND I LEARNED HOW
TO RUN A RACK OR TWO.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.608
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS HAVING DINNER
WITH A POOL SHARK.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.108
SO, DO YOU HAVE KIDS?

00:47.140 --> 00:50.303
NO. NO. YOU?

00:50.350 --> 00:52.818
MM-MM.
MAYBE SOMEDAY.

00:52.850 --> 00:56.411
I NEVER DO THIS--
BLIND DATES.

00:56.450 --> 00:57.815
ME NEITHER.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.648
BUT PHIL INSISTED THAT
WE MEET AND HE WOULDN'T--

01:00.690 --> 01:02.180
WOULDN'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.788
WAS HE LIKE THAT
WHEN HE WAS YOUR PARTNER?

01:03.830 --> 01:05.821
YOU MEAN LIKE
A PAIN IN THE ASS?

01:05.860 --> 01:08.693
I MEANT LIKE A DOG
WITH A BONE.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.698
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
HE BRINGS THE PUPPY
YOU GAVE HIM

01:10.730 --> 01:12.789
TO ALL HIS PHYSICAL
THERAPY SESSIONS.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.138
IT'S REALLY HELPING
WITH HIS RECOVERY.

01:15.170 --> 01:19.231
YEAH, HE TOLD ME THAT.
I'M REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.602
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.800
WHAT? I'M SORRY.

01:24.850 --> 01:27.410
THERE'S A VERY COLORFUL
WOMAN AT THE BAR.

01:27.450 --> 01:30.180
I THINK SHE'S TRYING
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.188
DO YOU KNOW HER?

01:32.220 --> 01:34.552
YEAH. EXCUSE ME.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.290
GARCIA, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

01:40.330 --> 01:44.198
I HATE TO BE THE BEARER
OF BUZZKILLING NEWS, BUT...

01:44.230 --> 01:45.561
WE HAVE A CASE?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.431
WELL, I TEXTED YOU.
YOU DIDN'T RESPOND BACK.

01:47.470 --> 01:49.506
I TURNED MY PHONE OFF
WHILE WE WERE EATING.

01:49.540 --> 01:50.507
WELL, I FIGURED.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.872
THAT'S WHY I PINGED
YOUR LOCATION ON MY WAY IN.

01:52.910 --> 01:54.275
ALL RIGHT,
LET ME TELL MY DATE.

01:54.310 --> 01:56.369
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MEET HER?

01:56.410 --> 01:58.878
I DON'T WANT
TO INTRUDE, BUT...

02:00.520 --> 02:02.408
IS EVERYTHING OK?

02:02.450 --> 02:03.747
LISA, THIS IS
PENELOPE GARCIA.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.916
WE WORK TOGETHER
AT THE BAU.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.180
PENELOPE,
THIS IS LISA DOUGLAS.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.380
H ELLO.
GARCIA: HEY.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.489
LISA, I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO GO.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.851
SORRY TO TEAR HIM AWAY.
DUTY CALLS.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.221
* BRR BRR BRR

02:13.260 --> 02:14.227
HA HA!

02:14.260 --> 02:15.158
SURE, I UNDERSTAND.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.667
YOU SHOULD STAY
AND, YOU KNOW,

02:16.700 --> 02:18.565
HAVE DESSERT OR COFFEE,
WHATEVER.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.296
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF TH%\|/(VAITER.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.274
LUKE IS A REALLY GREAT GUY,
IF YOU'RE WONDERING.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.232
ALTHOUGH HIM AND I ARE LIKE
THE PROVERBIAL OIL AND WATER,

02:28.280 --> 02:29.907
SILK AND SANDPAPER,
ELTON JOHN, MADONNA,

02:29.950 --> 02:31.406
BEFORE THEY KISSED AND
MADE UP.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.417
OH.

02:32.450 --> 02:33.940
OH, NO. NO. NOT LIKE THAT.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.868
I'VE HEARD OTHER PEOPLE SAY
HE'S SMART AND FUNNY

02:35.920 --> 02:37.239
AND, I GUESS,
EASY ON THE EYES,

02:37.290 --> 02:38.587
BUT HE'S NOT MY TYPE.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.485
AND WE'RE STRICTLY
WORK COLLEAGUES.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.953
THAT'S ALL. YEAH. YEAH.

02:41.990 --> 02:45.858
YEAH. LOOK, AGAIN,
I'M SORRY.

02:45.890 --> 02:48.256
UM, I'LL CALL YOU.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.426
OK.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.721
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.260
YOU, TOO.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.733
GET DESSERT.

02:55.270 --> 02:56.407
HEY, YOU BE'I'I'ER GET
A SITI'ER

02:56.440 --> 02:57.805
FOR THAT SWEET LITTLE
GIRL OF YOURS

02:57.840 --> 03:00.331
'CAUSE THIS CASE IS
GONNA BE A DOOZER.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.278
NYPD NEEDS OUR HELP.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.369
GARCIA: I'LL SAY THEY DO.
OK, EARLIER TONIGHT

03:06.420 --> 03:10.208
THE BODY OF A JOGGER,
BRAD NORTON, 32,

03:10.250 --> 03:11.387
WAS FOUND IN CENTRAL PARK.

03:11.420 --> 03:14.287
HE WAS DISEMBOWELED
AND HIS THROAT TORN OUT.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.288
GARCIA:
YEAH, AND THEN LAST MONTH,

03:16.330 --> 03:17.524
THE BODY OF VICTOR GUZMAN,

03:17.560 --> 03:20.256
26, WAS ALSO FOUND
IN CENTRAL PARK,

03:20.300 --> 03:22.598
AND HE HAD BEEN...
WHAT ROSSI SAID.

03:22.630 --> 03:23.824
ANY WITNESSES
TO EITHER CRIME?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.223
PRENTISS: NO, NONE.

03:25.270 --> 03:26.339
AND THE WOUNDS
ON BOTH VICTIMS

03:26.370 --> 03:27.359
LOOK LIKE CLAW
AND BITE MARKS

03:27.400 --> 03:28.435
FROM A LARGE ANIMAL.

03:28.470 --> 03:29.630
DID THE POLICE
CHECK TO SEE

03:29.670 --> 03:30.864
IF ANY LARGE
PREDATORY ANIMALS

03:30.910 --> 03:32.332
ESCAPED FROM
CENTRAL PARK ZOO?

03:32.380 --> 03:34.007
EVERY LAST CREATURE
HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR

03:34.040 --> 03:35.302
DOWN TO THE LAST PENGUIN.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.272
SIMMONS: WELL, THERE
ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK

03:36.310 --> 03:38.369
THAT HAVING EXOTIC PETS,
LIKE LIONS OR TIGERS,

03:38.410 --> 03:39.809
IS A GOOD IDEA.
MAYBE ONE ESCAPED

03:39.850 --> 03:41.738
OR WAS ABANDONED
AND IS LIVING IN THE PARK.

03:41.780 --> 03:42.815
THERE ARE
A LOT OF PLACES TO HIDE.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.715
CENTRAL PARK IS 843 ACRES,

03:44.750 --> 03:46.752
INCLUDING 58 MILES
OF PEDESTRIAN PATHS,

03:46.790 --> 03:48.849
36 BRIDGES,
7 BODIES OF WATER,

03:48.890 --> 03:51.256
6 MILES OR ROADS,
AND 5 MILES OF BRIDLE PATHS.

03:51.290 --> 03:54.418
JJ: IF IT IS A WILD ANIMAL,
IT'S A JOB FOR ANIMAL CONTROL.

03:54.460 --> 03:55.950
LEWIS: SOMEONE COULD
HAVE TRAINED A PIT BULL

03:56.000 --> 03:57.991
OR A LARGE BREED LIKE
A MASTIFF OR AN AKITA

03:58.030 --> 03:59.497
TO ATTACK ON COMMAND.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.634
I CAN SEARCH KENNELS
AND DOG BREEDERS
IN THE AREA.

04:02.670 --> 04:05.264
ROSSI: THIS CASE
REMINDS ME OF ONE FROM '97.

04:05.310 --> 04:07.835
TWO TEENAGERS KILLED
A MAN IN THE PARK

04:07.880 --> 04:09.279
IN ALMOST THE SAME WAY.

04:09.310 --> 04:11.301
YEAH, I WAS LIVING
IN THE BRONX THEN.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.978
IT'S, UH. ..DAPHNE--
DAPHNE ABDELLA

04:14.020 --> 04:15.612
AND A CHRISTOPHER VASQUEZ.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.288
THEY SLIT A MAN'S THROAT,
GU'I'I'ED HIM,

04:17.320 --> 04:19.459
AND THEN FILLED
HIS BODY CAVITY WITH STONES

04:19.490 --> 04:22.050
BEFORE THEY THREW HIM
IN ONE OF THE LAKES.

04:22.090 --> 04:26.026
WILD BEAST OR HUMAN,
EITHER WAY,
WHEELS UP IN 20.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.449
MAN: YOU HAVING
A GOOD TIME, HONEY?

04:28.500 --> 04:29.626
WOMAN: LET'S SEE.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.865
A SURPRISE TRIP
TO NEW YORK.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.596
TICKETS TO A BROADWAY SHOW.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.529
CHAMPAGNE ON TOP OF
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

04:37.570 --> 04:39.470
HMM. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:39.510 --> 04:42.035
WELL, I THINK
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

04:42.080 --> 04:45.345
YOU GET TO SPEND
25 YEARS WITH
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.608
OH, HONEY.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.618
HAPPY AN NIVERSARY,
HON EY.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.018
WE SHOULD HEAD BACK.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.312
HONEY, WHICH WAY
IS THE HOTEL?

04:55.360 --> 04:56.384
IT'S BEHIND US.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.682
JUST KEEP WALKING.

05:05.570 --> 05:06.798
AAH!

06:02.190 --> 06:04.385
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.589
LEWIS: "IT IS THE VERY
ERROR OF THE MOON.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.608
"SHE COMES MORE NEAR
THE EARTH THAN SHE WAS WONT

06:16.640 --> 06:19.529
AND MAKES MEN MAD."

06:19.580 --> 06:20.933
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.470
THE LATEST VICTIM,
BRAD NORTON,

06:22.510 --> 06:24.046
MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY
5 YEARS AGO

06:24.080 --> 06:25.104
FROM DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.710
ALVEZ: HE WAS SINGLE,
WORKED AS AN INSURANCE AGENT,

06:27.750 --> 06:29.115
AND HAD THE SAME JOB
FOR 10 YEARS.

06:29.150 --> 06:32.415
JJ: FROM ALL
ACCOUNTS, HE LIVED
A LOW-RISK LIFESTYLE.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.088
THOUGH JOGGING
IN THE PARK ALONE
AFI'ER DARK

06:35.120 --> 06:36.656
IS PRETI'Y HIGH-RISK
BEHAVIOR FOR ANYONE.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.055
GARCIA:
ACCORDING TO HIS SOCIAL MEDIA,

06:38.090 --> 06:39.694
HIS GOAL WAS TO RUN
A MARATHON.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.721
HE SAID, "NOTHING
WAS GOING TO STOP HIM."

06:41.760 --> 06:43.990
YEAH, WELL, WE ALL KNOW
HOW THAT TURNED OUT.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.089
SIMMONS: VICTOR GUZMAN,
THE VICTIM FROM LAST MONTH,

06:46.130 --> 06:48.098
IS A MUCH DIFFERENT STORY.
HE WAS A MEMBER

06:48.140 --> 06:50.165
OF THE AMSTERDAM CREW,
WHICH IS A PARTICULARLY

06:50.210 --> 06:52.633
VIOLENT GANG ON MANHATI'AN'S
UPPER WEST SIDE.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.136
YOU KNOW, SOME STREET GANGS
USE AGGRESSIVE DOGS

06:54.180 --> 06:55.977
AS A WEAPON TO INTIMIDATE
OR INSTILL FEAR.

06:56.010 --> 06:58.649
A RIVAL GANG MIGHT HAVE
TARGETED GUZMAN
TO SEND A MESSAGE.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.739
ALVEZ: THE JOGGER
HAD NO GANG TIES.

07:00.780 --> 07:02.611
BUT HE COULD HAVE WITNESSED
SOMETHING IN THE PARK

07:02.650 --> 07:04.049
WHILE HE WAS RUNNING.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.115
MAYBE IT'S A CASE
OF WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.459
MAYBE NOT TIME. BOTH ATTACKS
HAPPENED DURING A FULL MOON.

07:08.490 --> 07:09.752
JUST SAYING.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.553
COINCIDENCE OR LUNAR EFFECT?

07:11.590 --> 07:13.626
OH, COME ON.
NO ONE REALLY BELIEVES

07:13.660 --> 07:16.823
THE FULL MOON TRIGGERS
STRANGE AND ERRATIC
BEHAVIOR IN PEOPLE.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.997
GARCIA: UH, YES, THEY--
I--I DO.

07:19.030 --> 07:20.133
I BELIEVE THAT.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.569
YES. STUDIES,
ALBEIT INFORMAL,

07:21.600 --> 07:23.864
SHOW AN INCREASE
IN SUICIDES, HOMICIDES,

07:23.910 --> 07:26.037
E.R. VISITS, PSYCHIATRIC
HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS,

07:26.070 --> 07:28.174
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS, EVEN FIGHTS
AT PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY GAMES.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.770
GARCIA: YOU GUYS, ANOTHER VICTIM
WAS JUST FOUND AT THE PARK.

07:30.810 --> 07:32.471
SAME M.O., SAME FULL MOON.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.169
WHEN WE LAND, LUKE, JJ,

07:34.220 --> 07:35.573
GO TO THE LATEST
CRIME SCENE.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.508
DAVE, MA'IT, SEE WHAT
THE M.E. CAN TELL US.

07:37.550 --> 07:40.758
THE REST OF US WILL
SET UP IN THE PRECINCT
IN CENTRAL PARK.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.178
PRENTISS: DOES THE PARK HAVE
ANY SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS?

07:45.230 --> 07:46.925
AROUND THE PERIMETER.
NOT INSIDE.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.258
WE CHECKED THE FOOTAGE
BUT DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
UNUSUAL.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.722
WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK.

07:50.770 --> 07:51.919
OF COURSE.

07:51.970 --> 07:52.937
WHAT ARE
THE PARK'S HOURS?

07:52.970 --> 07:55.097
OPEN 365 DAYS A YEAR.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.062
IT'S CLOSED DAILY
FROM 1:00 TO 6 AM.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.532
YOU'LL NEED
ADDITIONAL UNITS,

07:58.570 --> 08:00.731
ON FOOT, BIKE, HORSEBACK,
AND IN VEHICLES.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.839
ALREADY DEPLOYED.
BUT WITH A PARK THIS SIZE,

08:02.880 --> 08:04.973
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN BE
EVERYWHERE AT EVERY MOMENT.

08:05.010 --> 08:06.739
WELL, HOPEFULLY
OUR GEO-PROFILE CAN HELP.

08:06.780 --> 08:08.714
THANK YOU.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.685
I WAS HOPING WE COULD KEEP A LID
ON THIS FOR A LITTLE LONGER,

08:11.720 --> 08:14.553
BUT THE MEDIA'S GO'I'I'EN
A WHIFF. THEY ALWAYS DO.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.148
"CENTRAL PARK RIPPER."
"WELCOME TO SLAUGHTER PARK."

08:16.190 --> 08:18.226
"MONSTER IN THE PARK."

08:18.260 --> 08:20.728
HEADLINES LIKE THESE
ARE ONLY GONNA CAUSE PANIC.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.763
OR GIVE OUR UNSUB EXACTLY
WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR--

08:23.800 --> 08:26.098
FAME AND GLORY.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.068
ALVEZ: THE VICTIM'S NAME
IS FRANKIE BROWN.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.304
HE'S GOT A LONG
RAP SHEET--

08:36.340 --> 08:38.001
THEFT, ASSAULT,
DRUG POSSESSION.

08:38.050 --> 08:40.211
THE WALLET AND THE BAG
BELONG TO A COUPLE
FROM OHIO

08:40.250 --> 08:41.717
WHO WERE MUGGED LAST NIGHT.

08:43.690 --> 08:47.751
WELL, ROBBERY DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE THE MOTIVE.

08:47.790 --> 08:51.829
HIS THROAT WAS RIPPED OUT,
AND HE WAS DISEMBOWELED
LIKE THE OTHERS.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.259
THE ROBBERY
HAPPENED ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE PARK.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.188
SO THE UNSUB MUST
HAVE FOLLOWED BROWN

08:55.230 --> 08:57.562
OR MAYBE TRACKED HIM
DOWN WITH A TRAINED DOG.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.728
IF WE DIDN'T KNOW
THE JOGGER LED SUCH
A SQUEAKY-CLEAN LIFE,

09:00.770 --> 09:03.102
I'D SAY THE UNSUB'S
A MORAL ENFORCER

09:03.140 --> 09:06.576
CLEARING OUT THE PARK
OF ITS BAD ELEMENTS.

09:06.610 --> 09:09.807
HE COULD BE SOME SORT OF
TERRITORIAL VIGILANTE.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.102
YOU KNOW, MIGHT FEEL LIKE
HE'S PROTECTING THE PARK,

09:12.150 --> 09:13.742
LIKE IT'S HIS HOME.

09:13.780 --> 09:16.817
OK, I'LL HAVE GARCIA
LOOK INTO PARK EMPLOYEES,

09:16.850 --> 09:20.251
ZOO WORKERS, TOUR GUIDES,
GROUNDSKEEPERS.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.952
THE UNSUB MAY VIEW
PARK-GOERS AS TRESPASSERS

09:22.990 --> 09:24.218
WHO NEED TO BE PUNISHED.

09:24.260 --> 09:25.921
THE JOGGER, MR. NORTON,

09:25.960 --> 09:28.121
HAD HIS CAROTID ARTERY
SEVERED FIRST.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.926
HE WAS THEN EVISCERATED
POSTMORTEM.

09:31.970 --> 09:34.359
AND THE VICTIM
FROM LAST MONTH, UH,

09:34.400 --> 09:35.992
VICTOR GUZMAN?

09:36.040 --> 09:37.598
HE WAS KILLED
THE SAME WAY.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.699
AND WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE WOUNDS?

09:39.740 --> 09:41.298
FATAL BITE MARKS INDICATE
THEY WERE MADE

09:41.340 --> 09:44.275
BY 4 LARGE, POINTED,
AND EXTREMELY SHARP TEETH,

09:44.310 --> 09:46.642
ONE ON EACH SIDE OF
THE UPPER AND LOWER JAW

09:46.680 --> 09:47.476
NEXT TO
THE INCISORS.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.114
THOSE ARE ESPECIALLY
PROMINENT IN DOGS.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.378
YES, THEY APPEAR CANINE.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.284
YOU KNOW WHICH BREED?

09:52.320 --> 09:54.379
I SENT SALIVA SAMPLES OUT
FOR DNA TESTING

09:54.420 --> 09:56.115
AND TO CHECK FOR
THE RABIES VIRUS ANTIGEN.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.354
THAT'LL TELL US.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.153
YOU SAID "APPEARED" CANINE.

09:59.190 --> 10:01.658
YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED
A DOG DID THIS?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.066
IN MY EXAM I FOUND
BITE MARKS AND HAIR

10:04.100 --> 10:05.260
FROM RATS AND RACCOONS

10:05.300 --> 10:07.165
THAT NIBBLED ON THE VICTIM
POSTMORTEM.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.235
THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.362
FERAL ANIMALS
WILL USUALLY FEAST

10:09.400 --> 10:10.367
ON WHATEVER
THEY CAN FIND.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.878
M.E.: TRUE,
BUT WHAT IS UNUSUAL.

10:12.910 --> 10:14.172
IS WHAT I DIDN'T FIND.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.678
THERE WASN'T ANY DOG HAIR
OR BLOODY PAW PRINTS

10:16.710 --> 10:19.349
ANYWHERE ON THE VICTIM'S
BODY OR CLOTHES. OH.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.349
LAB RESULTS.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.813
HUH.

10:23.850 --> 10:26.284
WHAT IS IT?

10:26.320 --> 10:29.209
THE, UH, SALIVA
FOUND IN THE BITE WOUNDS...

10:29.260 --> 10:30.852
IT'S HUMAN.

10:32.290 --> 10:35.657
THE UNSUB'S KILL
ZONE IS LITERALLY
ALL OVER THE MAP.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.998
YEAH. THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING ABOUT THE PARK

10:38.030 --> 10:39.793
THAT'S COMPELLING HIM
TO KILL THERE.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.139
HEY, GUYS.

10:43.170 --> 10:45.331
ROSSI SENT OVER A COPY
OF THE M.E. REPORT.

10:45.370 --> 10:47.429
THERE WERE TRACES
OF AMPHETAMINE AND MDA

10:47.480 --> 10:49.778
FOUND IN THE SALIVA
ON ALL 3 VICTIMS.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.278
ALVEZ: MDA IS A MORE
POTENT FORM OF ECSTASY.

10:52.310 --> 10:53.868
AND IT CAN
INDUCE DELUSIONS,

10:53.920 --> 10:55.217
HOSTILITY, EVEN
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

10:55.250 --> 10:58.708
THE UNSUB MAY BE SUFFERING
FROM SOME SORT
OF DRUG-INDUCED PSYCHOSIS.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.809
THAT COULD EXPLAIN
THE FRENZIED NATURE
OF THE KILLS.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.749
OK, WE'VE GOT DOG-LIKE
BITE MARKS, EVISCERATIONS,

11:03.790 --> 11:06.384
HUMAN SALIVA, DRUG USE,

11:06.430 --> 11:08.728
AND KILLS TIMED
TO THE LUNAR CYCLE.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.193
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.323
OUR UNSUB THINKS
HE'S A WEREWOLF.

11:12.370 --> 11:13.997
RIGHT.
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

11:14.040 --> 11:15.928
WELL, NOT AN ACTUAL ONE,
OBVIOUSLY,

11:15.970 --> 11:17.858
BUT HE MAY BE SUFFERING
FROM A SYNDROME

11:17.910 --> 11:19.730
CALLED CLINICAL LYCANTHROPY.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.772
IT IS RARE,
BUT IT'S A RECOGNIZED
MEDICAL CONDITION.

11:22.810 --> 11:25.040
S0 A MAN WITH A BEAST
INSIDE OF HIM.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.968
THE SALIVA ALSO SHOWED
HIGH LEVELS OF CORTISOL.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.772
CORTISOL RISES SLOWLY
OVER TIME AND TAKES TIME

11:28.820 --> 11:30.412
TO RETURN
TO ITS BASE LEVEL,

11:30.450 --> 11:32.759
INDICATING SOMEONE'S
UNDER AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF STRESS.

11:32.790 --> 11:33.882
THAT'S JUST ABOUT EVERYONE
THESE DAYS.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.150
WHAT BUMPS ME
ARE THE BITE MARKS.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.124
SO WHAT DID HE DO,
HE FILED DOWN

11:38.160 --> 11:39.479
AND SHARPENED
HIS OWN TEETH?

11:39.530 --> 11:41.225
HUMAN TEETH,
WHILE INCREDIBLY STRONG,

11:41.260 --> 11:43.490
ARE TOO SMALL TO INFLICT
THESE KINDS OF WOUNDS.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.419
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY
THAT HE FASHIONED
SOME SORT OF MOUTHPIECE

11:46.470 --> 11:48.028
TO MIMIC THAT OF A DOG'S.

11:48.070 --> 11:50.209
CREATING A CANINE
MOUTHPIECE WOULD SPEAK

11:50.240 --> 11:52.003
TO HIS ORGANIZATION,
WHICH IS SOMETHING

11:52.040 --> 11:53.405
A PSYCHOTIC KILLER
WOULDN'T SHOW.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.102
ALVEZ: IT WOULD ALSO MEAN
THAT HE MADE A CONSCIOUS
DECISION TO MAKE IT.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.199
LEWIS: WELL, HE COULD BE
INDUCING HIS WOLF DELUSION.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.844
I MEAN, MAYBE IT PROVIDES
AN ESCAPE OR A RELEASE
FROM SOMETHING.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.713
BUT WHAT?

12:11.560 --> 12:15.098
YOU! BY THE GARBAGE.

12:15.130 --> 12:20.193
TURN AROUND SLOWLY
WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.764
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!

12:21.800 --> 12:24.906
DO IT NOW!

12:35.180 --> 12:37.512
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN
CENTRAL PARK LAST NIGHT, CHAD?

12:37.550 --> 12:39.438
CHAD: I FELL ASLEEP
ON A BENCH.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.151
AND BEFORE
YOU FELL ASLEEP?

12:41.190 --> 12:44.819
I DRANK, YOU KNOW,
SMOKED SOME WEED.

12:44.860 --> 12:47.021
IT HELPS ME FORGET
ABOUT BEING COLD.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.823
SIMMONS: MM-HMM. YOU'VE
GO'I'TEN A NUMBER OF SUMMONSES

12:48.860 --> 12:52.068
FOR LOITERING,
AGGRESSIVE PANHANDLING,

12:52.100 --> 12:53.499
STAYING IN THE PARK
AFTER CLOSING HOURS.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.360
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HANGING OUT THERE SO MUCH?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.903
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A COOL PLACE.

12:57.940 --> 12:59.828
WELL, YEAH, IT MUST BE.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.529
YOU'VE RUN AWAY FROM
YOUR FOSTER GROUP HOME

13:01.580 --> 13:04.344
IN THE BRONX
ABOUT 10 TIMES?

13:04.380 --> 13:05.802
IT'S SAFER IN THE PARK.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.044
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MOM AND DAD?

13:07.080 --> 13:09.173
WHEN CHAD WAS 5,
HIS FATHER KILLED HIS MOTHER

13:09.220 --> 13:10.517
IN A MURDER-SUICIDE.

13:10.550 --> 13:11.585
THE BODIES WEREN'T DISCOVERED

13:11.620 --> 13:14.111
UNTIL CHAD TOLD A NEIGHBOR
HE COULDN'T WAKE THEM UP.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.049
JJ: OK, SO, YOU GOT HIGH
IN THE PARK. THEN WHAT?

13:17.090 --> 13:18.921
BLACKED OUT, I GUESS.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.359
YOU BLACKED OUT?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.549
YEAH, NEXT THING I KNOW,
THE COPS ARE YELLING AT ME.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.965
YOU HAVE BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.160
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

13:24.200 --> 13:27.135
I MUST HAVE DONE
SOMETHING BAD?

13:27.170 --> 13:29.559
HE'S EITHER LYING
OR CAN'T REMEMBER
BECAUSE OF THE DRUG USE.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.363
IT DOESN'T ADD UP.
HOW DOES A KID

13:31.410 --> 13:32.604
GO FROM COMMI'I'TING
LOW-LEVEL CRIMES

13:32.640 --> 13:34.278
TO BRUTAL
AND SAVAGE MURDER?

13:34.310 --> 13:37.404
SIMMONS:
THE COAT WITH BLOOD
ON IT

13:37.450 --> 13:38.872
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

13:38.910 --> 13:41.071
I DON'T REMEMBER.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.544
THE BLOOD WAS MATCHED TO
A MAN NAMED FRANKIE BROWN.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.888
DID YOU SEE HIM LAST NIGHT?

13:48.660 --> 13:50.924
HE'S A SHORT WHITE GUY

13:50.960 --> 13:53.622
WITH A SPIDER TAT ON HIS NECK.

13:53.660 --> 13:58.063
CHAD: YEAH, I SAW HIM.
WE HUNG OUT AT THE BANDSHELL...

13:58.100 --> 14:01.536
ROSSI: EXCEPT FRANKIE BROWN
WAS TALL AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.561
CHAD COULD HAVE FOUND
THE COAT

14:03.610 --> 14:06.033
AFTER THE UNSUB DISCARDED IT
AS A FORENSIC COUNTERMEASURE.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.470
SIMMONS: FRANKIE BROWN WAS
FOUND MURDERED LAST NIGHT.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.204
I DID IT.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.649
I REMEMBER NOW.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.012
I, UH, I DID IT.

14:16.050 --> 14:17.642
IT'S A FALSE CONFESSION.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.349
IT'S A CONFESSION.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.483
HE HAS NO HISTORY
OF VIOLENCE.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.511
INNOCENT SUSPECT S
OFTEN CONFESS

14:22.560 --> 14:24.448
WHEN THEY'RE CONFUSED,
TERRIFIED, EXHAUSTED,

14:24.490 --> 14:25.582
OR FEELING HOPELESS.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.996
ROSSI: CHAD COULD BE
DELIBERATELY TRYING
TO GET HIMSELF

14:28.030 --> 14:30.498
OFF THE STREET AND AS FAR AWAY
AS HE CAN FROM HIS GROUP HOME.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.998
TO HIM, PRISON
IS A BETTER OPTION.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.634
YEAH. AND HE MUST HAVE
HAD SOME INTERACTION
WITH THE UNSUB.

14:35.670 --> 14:38.161
WE NEED TO INTERVIEW HIM
AGAIN WHEN HE SOBERS UP.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.337
OFFICER: YEAH, WELL UNTIL
THE DNA TESTS COME IN,

14:40.380 --> 14:42.029
HE'S STAYING IN CUSTODY.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.527
DAMN IT.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.504
AAH!

15:27.190 --> 15:30.387
PRENTISS: VIHAAN PATEL.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.149
SO HE WAS STILL SELLING
HOT DOGS AT NIGHT?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.394
ACCORDING
TO THE COPS,

15:34.430 --> 15:35.226
HE GOT INTO A HEATED
DISPUTE EARLIER

15:35.260 --> 15:36.989
IN THE NIGHT WITH
AN UNLICENSED VENDOR

15:37.030 --> 15:39.066
WHO WAS TRYING
TO POACH PATEL'S SPOT.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.089
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
VENDORS CAN PAY

15:40.140 --> 15:42.165
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS IN LICENSING FEES

15:42.200 --> 15:43.963
FOR PRIME PARK LOCATIONS.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.659
APPARENTLY THE DISPUTE
SCARED AWAY SOME CUSTOMERS,

15:45.710 --> 15:47.337
SO PATEL TOLD HIS WIFE
HE WAS GOING TO TRY

15:47.380 --> 15:48.472
TO MAKE UP
FOR THE LOST BUSINESS.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.171
PRENTISS: AND JUDGING
BY THE BLOOD TRAIL,

15:50.210 --> 15:51.973
HE WAS DRAGGED TO THIS SPOT.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.443
HIS BRUTALITY'S ESCALATING.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.038
NOT ONLY IS PATEL'S
THROAT TORN,

15:55.080 --> 15:56.479
HE'S NEARLY DECAPITATED.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.284
SO THIS UNSUB IS SHOWING
NO MERCY TO HIS VICTIMS,

15:59.320 --> 16:01.311
YET HE DIDN'T KILL
CHAD HIGGINS

16:01.360 --> 16:03.521
WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP
ON THAT PARK BENCH. WHY?

16:03.560 --> 16:06.051
WELL, CHAD WILL BE
CLEAR-HEADED BY NOW.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.250
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.499
THERE'S MORE IF YOU WANT.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.448
CHAD, IT'S NOT SAFE
TO BE IN THE PARK
ALONE AFTER DARK.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.448
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.415
I'M GOING TO PRISON, RIGHT,
FOR WHAT I DID?

16:28.450 --> 16:30.179
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.486
WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T
KILL ANYONE.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.284
THE DNA DOESN'T MATCH,
AND WHILE YOU WERE IN CUSTODY,

16:36.320 --> 16:37.685
THERE WAS ANOTHER MURDER
IN THE PARK.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.789
THEN HOW'D THAT BLOODY
COAT GET ON ME

16:39.830 --> 16:41.252
I HAD BLOOD ON MY HANDS.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.667
JJ: WELL, WE WANT TO TRY
AND HELP YOU REMEMBER.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.122
OK?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.135
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

16:54.240 --> 16:59.177
OK. LAST NIGHT,
YOU'RE IN THE PARK.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.043
WHAT'S THE FIRST
THING YOU REMEMBER?

17:03.420 --> 17:05.684
IT WAS REALLY COLD.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.051
YOU KNOW, MY FACE STINGS.

17:07.090 --> 17:08.819
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?

17:08.860 --> 17:11.454
TRAFFIC.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.549
YOU KNOW, A SIREN
IN THE DISTANCE.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.489
SOMEBODY ON A BIKE. THEY'RE
GOING BY REALLY FAST.

17:16.530 --> 17:19.260
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:19.300 --> 17:21.291
I'M ON A BENCH,

17:21.340 --> 17:23.205
TRYING TO SLEEP.

17:23.240 --> 17:26.698
I HEAR FOOTSTEPS.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.207
DID YOU OPEN YOUR EYES?

17:28.240 --> 17:30.379
NO.

17:30.410 --> 17:32.503
I'M AFRAID. I'M HOPING
TH EY'LL JUST GO AWAY.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.177
ALVEZ: BUT THEY DON'T.

17:35.450 --> 17:39.443
NO. I CAN STILL
HEAR HIS BREATH.

17:39.490 --> 17:40.855
JJ: HIS?

17:40.890 --> 17:42.778
WHO'S THERE
WITH YOU?

17:42.820 --> 17:45.220
A MAN...

17:45.260 --> 17:46.750
STANDING OVER ME.

17:46.790 --> 17:50.191
ALVEZ: WHAT DOES
HE LOOK LIKE?

17:50.230 --> 17:51.788
I DIDN'T SEE HIS FACE.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.232
IS HE THE ONE
PUTTING THE COAT ON YOU?

17:56.270 --> 17:58.568
YEAH.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.373
IT'S WARM.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.469
I--I, UM, I PULL IT
AROUND ME.

18:02.510 --> 18:05.240
DOES HE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU?

18:05.280 --> 18:08.113
UNSUB:
YOU NEED TO STAY WARM.

18:08.150 --> 18:10.880
"YOU NEED TO STAY WARM."

18:10.920 --> 18:14.549
DID HE SAY
ANYTHING ELSE?

18:14.590 --> 18:16.410
UH-UH.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.353
OK.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.119
YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.638
YOU DID GOOD.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.730
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

18:31.770 --> 18:33.169
NOW YOU GET RELEASED.

18:33.210 --> 18:38.147
AND AN OFFICER WILL DRIVE
YOU BACK TO THE BRONX.

18:40.320 --> 18:44.916
YOU'D RATHER GO TO PRISON
THAN BACK TO THAT GROUP HOME.

18:44.950 --> 18:47.316
YOU GOTTA KNOW PRISON'S
ONLY GONNA BE WORSE.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.224
WE ARE GOING TO
LOOK INTO GETTING YOU

18:53.260 --> 18:57.219
INTO A SAFER LIVING
SITUATION, OK? WE PROMISE.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.159
WHATEVER.
I'M GONNA BE 18 SOON,

19:00.200 --> 19:03.408
AND THEN I'LL BE
OUT OF THERE FOR GOOD.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.847
SO THE UNSUB PLACED
HIS COAT ON HIM

19:16.880 --> 19:18.814
IN AN ACT OF KINDNESS.

19:18.850 --> 19:22.217
IT'S IRONIC. SEEMS
HE CARED MORE FOR CHAD

19:22.260 --> 19:26.253
THAN ANY OF HIS FOSTER
FAMILIES EVER DID.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.827
IT'S TIME TO DELIVER
THE PROFILE.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.191
ROSSI: THE UNSUB
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

19:30.230 --> 19:32.619
IS SUFFERING FROM
CLINICAL LYCANTHROPY.

19:32.670 --> 19:35.264
IT'S A RARE BUT REAL
PSYCHIATRIC SYNDROME

19:35.300 --> 19:38.201
WHERE THE PERSON
BELIEVES HE CAN
TRANSFORM INTO AN ANIMAL.

19:38.240 --> 19:41.539
IN MOST RECORDED CASES,
THAT ANIMAL IS A WOLF.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.605
SO YOU'RE SAYING THIS GUY
THINKS HE'S A WEREWOLF.

19:43.650 --> 19:47.211
DO WE NEED TO PUT
SILVER BULLETS IN OUR GUNS?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.215
ALTHOUGH THE LEGEND
OF THE WEREWOLF

19:51.250 --> 19:52.786
CAN BE TRACKED BACK
TO THE ANCIENT GREEKS,

19:52.820 --> 19:55.516
THIS SYNDROME'S ASSOCIATED
WITH MENTAL PRECONDITIONS,

19:55.560 --> 19:58.427
LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA,
DRUG-INDUCED PSYCHOSIS.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.599
A DRUG-INDUCED PSYCHOSIS
IS OFTEN TRIGGERED

20:00.630 --> 20:03.463
WITH THE USE OF HALLUCINOGENS,
LIKE LSD OR ECSTASY.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.367
ALVEZ: ANOTHER PRECONDITION
COULD BE SEVERE DEPRESSION.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.790
OUR UNSUB MIGHT BE FACING
A MAJOR STRESSOR
IN HIS LIFE RIGHT NOW,

20:09.840 --> 20:11.728
AND DRUG USE COULD BE
HIS WAY OF COPING WITH IT.

20:11.770 --> 20:15.399
JJ: AND IT'S LIKELY
HE IS FULLY AWARE
OF HIS ACTIONS

20:15.440 --> 20:18.648
AND HE'S ENJOYING
THE POWER AND CONTROL
THEY'RE GIVING HIM.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.716
ROSSI: THOUGH WHILE
IN HIS DELUSIONAL STATE,

20:20.750 --> 20:22.775
HE'S CONVINCED
HE'S SHAPE-SHIFTING.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.515
HE MAY BE USING
A FABRICATED MOUTHPIECE

20:24.550 --> 20:26.541
TO COMPLETE
HIS TRANSFORMATION.

20:26.590 --> 20:29.252
PRENTISS: BASED ON HIS TENDER
TREATMENT OF CHAD HIGGINS,

20:29.290 --> 20:30.951
THE UNSUB MAY HAVE
SUFFERED A LOSS.

20:30.990 --> 20:34.255
LEWIS: THIS DUALISTIC, OR
JEKYLL-AND HYDE-LIKE BEHAVIOR,

20:34.300 --> 20:36.450
INDICATES A PERSONALITY
SPLIT OF SOME KIND.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.559
REID: WHICH MEANS THE UNSUB'S
HUMAN SIDE MAY BE STRUGGLING

20:38.600 --> 20:40.864
TO KEEP THE VIOLENT
ANIMAL WITHIN HIM AT BAY.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.891
LEWIS: WITH CONTINUED DRUG USE,
IT'S POSSIBLE HE'LL SUFFER

20:42.940 --> 20:44.635
A PERMANENT BREAK FROM REALITY,

20:44.670 --> 20:47.377
WITH HIS VIOLENT PERSONA
COMPLETELY TAKING OVER.

20:47.410 --> 20:49.708
PRENTISS: WHICH MEANS
HE WILL CONTINUE KILLING,

20:49.740 --> 20:52.948
AND IT COULD BE ANYONE
HE COMES ACROSS IN THE PARK.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.869
ROSSI: WE'LL BE CONDUCTING
A COORDINATED STAKEOUT

20:56.920 --> 21:00.287
OF THE PARK BEGINNING
AT DUSK UNTIL 6 AM.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.050
CAPTAIN SAVALAS WILL HAVE
YOUR ASSIGNMENTS.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.456
THANK YOU.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.392
HI.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.863
YOU LOOK GREAT.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.707
I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.605
I CAN'T STAY LONG.
I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.379
PLEASE. PLEASE SIT.

21:30.390 --> 21:34.713
I SWEAR, WHAT WOULD
DENNIGAN, SHUSTER,
AND WHITE DO WITHOUT YOU?

21:34.760 --> 21:36.318
OH.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.726
YOUR CAFFEINE FIX.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.749
I KNOW HOW
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH

21:39.790 --> 21:41.496
THE AFTERNOON SLUMP
WITHOUT IT.

21:41.530 --> 21:44.328
THAN KS.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.759
YOU SAID
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.968
IS EVERYTHING OK?
YOU LOOK TIRED.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.466
I'M GOOD.

21:52.510 --> 21:55.399
IN FACT, I'M BETTER
THAN GOOD.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.405
I'VE CHANGED, ADELE.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.372
I'M NOT THE MAN
I USED TO BE.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.614
MITCH, I DON'T WANT TO--

22:02.650 --> 22:04.845
PLEASE. HEAR ME OUT.

22:06.620 --> 22:09.783
I KNOW THAT I WASN'T
THE KIND OF MAN

22:09.820 --> 22:11.629
YOU NEEDED ME TO BE
BACK THEN.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.127
THE KIND YOU BOTH NEEDED.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.491
MITCH, PLEASE.

22:14.530 --> 22:16.020
BUT I--I AM NOW.

22:16.060 --> 22:18.369
YOU KNOW IT CAN
NEVER BE THE SAME.

22:18.400 --> 22:22.029
BUT IT COULD
STILL BE GOOD.

22:22.070 --> 22:24.106
WE CAN WORK IT OUT...

22:24.140 --> 22:25.368
TOGETHER.

22:25.410 --> 22:28.004
WE TRIED. REMEMBER?

22:29.480 --> 22:32.745
WE BOTH NEED TO MOVE ON.

22:32.780 --> 22:35.374
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO GO.

22:47.930 --> 22:49.158
PRENTISS: MATT, LUKE.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.622
YEAH. GO AHEAD, EMILY.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.490
WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?

22:52.530 --> 22:53.792
IT'S ALL QUIET HERE.
NOTHING TO REPORT.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.536
SAME AS THE OTHERS.
OK, STAY ALERT.

22:56.570 --> 22:59.698
10-4, BOSS.
OVER AND OUT.

23:04.450 --> 23:07.169
SO WHO IS SHE?

23:07.210 --> 23:09.576
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:09.620 --> 23:11.508
THAT'S ABOUT THE 10th TIME
YOU'VE CHECKED YOUR PHONE.

23:11.550 --> 23:13.518
WHO IS SHE?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.482
I MET HER
ON A BLIND DATE.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.782
AHH.

23:16.820 --> 23:21.951
SHE'S, UH, FUNNY
AND BEAUTIFUL AND SMART.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.991
SHE CAN'T BE TOO SMART.
SHE WENT OUT WITH YOU.

23:24.030 --> 23:26.590
WELL, SHE'S, UH,
SHE'S A DOCTOR.

23:26.630 --> 23:28.894
SHE WORKED FOR
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS.

23:28.940 --> 23:33.502
AND THEN SHE VOLUNTEERED
IN PAKISTAN, YEMEN,
SOUTH SUDAN.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.076
DANGEROUS PLACES TO WORK.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.975
YEAH.

23:37.010 --> 23:40.002
ANYWAY, THE DATE GOT
INTERRUPTED BY THIS CASE.

23:40.050 --> 23:42.848
BY GARCIA, ACTUALLY.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.110
I TOLD HER I'D CALL HER,
AND I LEFT A MESSAGE,

23:45.150 --> 23:48.017
BUT THERE'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT RADIO SILENCE SINCE.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.153
YOU THINK WHAT WE DO
FOR A LIVING

23:50.190 --> 23:51.225
HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT?

23:51.260 --> 23:54.525
NAH. ONE OF HER
BROTHERS IS A COP,

23:54.560 --> 23:56.858
AND SHE KNOWS THE LIFE.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.788
WELL, I WOULDN'T SWEAT IT.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.559
YOU'LL HEAR FROM HER SOON.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.693
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,
WHEN I WAS HUNTING
DOWN FUGITIVES,

24:02.740 --> 24:04.230
I PREFERRED BEING ALONE.

24:04.270 --> 24:08.707
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,
NO ONE TYING ME DOWN.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.607
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

24:11.650 --> 24:14.619
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HER.

24:16.550 --> 24:19.110
YOU POOR BASTARD.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.892
WHO FOUND HER?
SANITATION CREW.

25:09.940 --> 25:10.964
HER BODY WAS HIDDEN
BY A MATTRESS

25:11.010 --> 25:11.965
THEY WE'RE ABOUT
TO HAUL AWAY.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.261
WITNESSES?

25:13.310 --> 25:15.039
IF THERE WERE,
THEY HAVEN'T COME FORWARD.

25:15.080 --> 25:19.005
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO "SEE
SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING"?

25:19.050 --> 25:22.269
REID: M.E. PLACES THE
TIME OF DEATH BETWEEN
MIDNIGHT AND 2 AM.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.844
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
HE'S KILLED A FEMALE

25:23.890 --> 25:26.108
AND THE FIRST TIME
HE'S ATTACKED
OUTSIDE THE PARK.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.914
ROSSI:
IT'S JUST A FEW BLOCKS.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.019
DESPITE OUR STAKEOUT
AND THE RISK
OF BEING SEEN,

25:31.060 --> 25:33.278
HE STILL FELT COMPELLED
TO RETURN TO THE PARK.

25:33.330 --> 25:37.198
VICTIM'S BEEN DISEMBOWELED,
THROAT'S TORN OUT.

25:37.230 --> 25:38.197
LOOK AT THIS.

25:38.230 --> 25:39.868
REID: PINKY
AND THE RING FINGER

25:39.900 --> 25:41.299
HAVE BEEN BITTEN OFF
ON HER LEFT HAND.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.069
HE'S UNRAVELING.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.103
HE'LL FIND IT HARDER
TO CONTAIN HIS RAGE.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.835
THIS MAY BE TURNING
INTO A SPREE.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.973
IF HE'S KILLING
OUTSIDE THE PARK NOW,

25:50.010 --> 25:53.571
THIS WHOLE CITY'S IN DANGER.

26:13.170 --> 26:15.638
KELLY SINCLAIR WAS ATTACKED
WALKING HER DOG.

26:15.670 --> 26:18.036
HER FIANCE SAID SHE NEVER
TOOK OFF HER DIAMOND
ENGAGEMENT RING

26:18.070 --> 26:19.708
SINCE THE DAY HE PROPOSED.

26:19.740 --> 26:21.173
REID: AND THE RING WAS NOT
RECOVERED AT THE CRIME SCENE.

26:21.210 --> 26:23.132
THE UNSUB
COULD HAVE TAKEN IT.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.909
PRENTISS:
HE'S NEVER TAKEN SOUVENIRS
FROM ANY OF HIS OTHER VICTIMS,

26:24.950 --> 26:26.679
AND WHY JUST THE RING?

26:26.710 --> 26:29.144
SHE WAS ALSO WEARING
AN EXPENSIVE NECKLACE
AND WATCH.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.989
LEWIS: BITING OFF KELLY'S FINGER
COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

26:31.020 --> 26:32.214
WITH THE REAL TARGET
OF THE UNSUB'S RAGE.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.979
A WIFE

26:34.020 --> 26:35.783
SIMMONS: WE SAID THAT HE MAY
HAVE SUFFERED SOME KIND OF LOSS.

26:35.820 --> 26:37.253
TAKING KELLY'S RING
MAY SYM BOLIZE A DIVORCE,

26:37.290 --> 26:40.748
A BROKEN ENGAGEMENT,
DEATH OF A SPOUSE.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.927
PRENTISS: WHEN THE UNSUB
PUT HIS COAT OVER CHAD

26:42.960 --> 26:44.769
WHILE HE WAS SLEEPING
ON THE PARK BENCH,

26:44.800 --> 26:47.894
HE WAS ACTING MORE LIKE
A PROTECTOR THAN A PREDATOR.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.067
WOLVES BY NATURE
ARE FEARLESS PREDATORS,

26:50.100 --> 26:51.761
BUT THEY'RE ALSO
INCREDIBLY SOCIAL.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.732
THEY LIVE IN PACKS,
THEY MATE FOR LIFE,

26:53.780 --> 26:55.771
THEY FIERCELY PROTECT
THEIR FAMILY.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.949
WHAT IF THERE WAS A LOSS
TO HIS FAMILY UNIT?

26:57.980 --> 26:59.140
HIS PACK, SO TO SPEAK.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.978
LEWIS: IF HE FAILED TO PROTECT
A FAMILY MEMBER IN THAT PARK,

27:02.020 --> 27:03.373
HE COULD BE TRYING
TO RIGHT THAT WRONG

27:03.420 --> 27:05.684
BY TARGETING THOSE
HE PERCEIVES TO BE BAD.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.881
PROTECTOR TRANSFORMING
INTO VIGILANTE.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.750
REID: EXACTLY. THE UNSUB
COULD HAVE WITNESSED

27:08.790 --> 27:10.985
VICTOR GUZMAN INVOLVED
IN GANG ACTIVITY,

27:11.030 --> 27:13.055
FRANKIE BROWN MUGGING
THE OUT OF TOWN COUPLE,

27:13.090 --> 27:14.899
AN IN HIS DELUSION,
IT MIGHT HAVE LOOKED LIKE

27:14.930 --> 27:17.148
THE JOGGER, BRAD NORTON,
WAS FLEEING THE SCENE
OF A CRIME.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.269
WHY THE HOT DOG VENDOR?

27:18.300 --> 27:19.995
WELL, MAYBE HE SAW MR. PATEL

27:20.030 --> 27:21.167
HAVE THAT FIGHT
WITH THE OTHER VENDOR.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.428
PRENTISS: GARCIA.

27:22.470 --> 27:24.062
EMILY PRENTISS, YOU HAVE ESP.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.670
AND BY THAT I MEAN, ESPECIALLY
SPECTACULAR POSTURE,

27:26.710 --> 27:28.439
BUT ALSO THE OTHER KIND,
'CAUSE I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO CALL YOU.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.777
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

27:29.810 --> 27:31.243
UNFORTUNATELY
A LOT OF BUPKIS.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.010
I FOUND TWO CURRENT
LYCANTH ROPY CASES

27:34.050 --> 27:35.415
BUT NONE
IN THE NEW YORK AREA.

27:35.450 --> 27:38.419
AND AS FAR AS PARK EMPLOYEES
WITH RED FLAGS,

27:38.450 --> 27:40.418
THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S LIKE
FLAPPING IN THE BREEZE.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.054
WE NEED YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

27:42.090 --> 27:43.250
BRING IT.

27:43.290 --> 27:44.450
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR INCIDENTS

27:44.490 --> 27:45.752
THAT HAPPENED
IN THE PARK

27:45.790 --> 27:47.690
THAT MAY HAVE INVOLVED
A CHILD OR FAMILY.

27:47.730 --> 27:48.822
GO BACK 10 YEARS.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.397
PULLING UP CRIME STATS NOW.

27:51.430 --> 27:54.160
AH, I'M GONNA NEED
A SKOSH BIT MORE TIME

27:54.200 --> 27:55.690
TO GO THROUGH THIS.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.968
OK, GET BACK TO US.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.730
YOU KNOW IT.
GARCIA DOWN, BUT NOT OUT.

28:02.010 --> 28:02.977
ALVEZ.

28:03.010 --> 28:05.149
HI, LUKE, IT'S LISA.

28:05.180 --> 28:08.479
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

28:08.520 --> 28:10.715
GOOD. GOOD.

28:10.750 --> 28:13.116
UM, I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO RETURN YOUR CALL.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.084
I'VE JUST BEEN SLAMMED
AT WORK.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.156
HEY, NO WORRIES.

28:17.190 --> 28:19.829
LISTEN, I WANTED
TO THANK YOU AGAIN

28:19.860 --> 28:22.090
FOR DINNER,
BUT I DON'T THINK

28:22.130 --> 28:25.019
IT'S GONNA WORK OUT
BETWEEN US.

28:25.070 --> 28:28.494
OK. UM, I'D BE LYING
IF I SAID

28:28.540 --> 28:30.167
I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.838
I THOUGHT WE HIT IT OFF.

28:31.870 --> 28:35.169
BUT, UH, I GUESS
I WAS WRONG.

28:36.310 --> 28:39.006
AM I WRONG?

28:39.050 --> 28:41.109
NO.

28:41.150 --> 28:45.086
BUT...FOR ANY
RELATIONSHIP TO WORK,

28:45.120 --> 28:46.348
I BELIEVE
IT NEEDS TO BE TRUTHFUL,

28:46.390 --> 28:49.382
AND AT DINNER,
YOU WEREN'T HONEST WITH ME.

28:49.420 --> 28:51.149
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

28:51.190 --> 28:52.953
YOU TOLD ME
YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.093
I DON'T.

28:54.130 --> 28:56.325
YOUR CO-WORKER, GARCIA,

28:56.360 --> 28:58.863
BEFORE YOU TWO LEFT,
SHE SAID YOU'D NEED A SITTER

28:58.900 --> 29:00.458
FOR YOUR SWEET LITTLE GIRL.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.007
ROXY.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.064
THAT'S HER NAM E?

29:06.110 --> 29:08.203
YEAH, BUT SHE'S NOT
MY DAUGHTER.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.175
SHE'S MY DOG.

29:11.210 --> 29:11.972
A DOG?

29:12.010 --> 29:16.515
YEAH. A VERY SWEET
BELGIAN MALINOIS.

29:16.550 --> 29:20.213
OH, BOY. DO I FEEL
LIKE A JERK.

29:20.250 --> 29:24.823
LOOK, I CAN SEE
HOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT.

29:24.860 --> 29:27.920
LISTEN, WHY DON'T--
WHY DON'T WE START OVER?

29:27.960 --> 29:30.520
HI. I'M LUKE.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.267
HI, LUKE. I'M LISA.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.138
MAMA PAJAMA.

29:42.610 --> 29:44.100
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.299
I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO CRIMES

29:45.350 --> 29:46.942
THAT HAPPENED IN THE PARK

29:46.980 --> 29:49.346
AMONG FAMILIES AND CHILDREN
IN PARTICULAR.

29:49.380 --> 29:50.847
I THINK I FOUND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.141
PLEASE CHECK YOUR TABLETS.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.283
2 YEARS AGO THIS MONTH,
THE MCCORD FAMILY

29:54.320 --> 29:56.515
OF BELLEROSE, QUEENS,
FATHER MITCHELL,

29:56.560 --> 29:59.085
MOTHER ADELE,
15-YEAR-OLD SON BRYCE,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.257
DECIDED TO GO ICE-SKATING
IN THE CITY.

30:01.300 --> 30:05.259
ON THEIR WAY HOME, THEY WENT
FOR A WALK IN THE PARK.

30:05.300 --> 30:08.030
THEY WERE CONFRONTED
BY A ROBBER WITH A GUN.

30:08.070 --> 30:09.935
BRYCE INTERVENED.

30:09.970 --> 30:12.109
AND HE WAS SHOT AND DIED
IN HIS MOTHER'S ARMS.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.971
TALK ABOUT YOUR
OFF-THE-CHARTS STRESSOR.

30:14.010 --> 30:15.102
AND IT WAS A FULL MOON
THAT NIGHT.

30:15.140 --> 30:16.607
MITCHELL MUST HAVE
STARTED USING DRUGS

30:16.640 --> 30:18.574
TO SELF-MEDICATE
TO ESCAPE HIS PAIN
AND GRIEF.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.339
SO IN HIS DELUSIONS,
HE CAN RELEASE HIS RAGE

30:20.380 --> 30:22.211
AND DISPENSE HIS OWN
VIGILANTE JUSTICE.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.013
ROSSI: GARCIA, WHAT DOES
THE DAD DO FOR A LIVING?

30:24.050 --> 30:25.278
UH...

30:26.650 --> 30:28.254
HE WORKS AS A DENTAL
LAB TECHNICIAN.

30:28.290 --> 30:30.850
ALVEZ: NOW WE KNOW WHERE HE
MADE THE CANINE MOUTHPIECE.

30:30.890 --> 30:32.858
PRENTISS: GARCIA,
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

30:32.890 --> 30:36.428
YEAH. WORK AND HOME
ADDRESSES, SENT.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.090
IN THE BACK.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.289
I GOT THE SIDE.

30:43.340 --> 30:45.501
COVER.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.906
FBI! WARRANT!

30:49.380 --> 30:51.405
MITCHELL MCCORD,
WHERE IS HE?

30:51.450 --> 30:53.247
MAN: HONEY?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.316
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:55.350 --> 30:58.513
MITCHELL DOESN'T
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.422
PRENTISS:
WHERE CAN WE FIND HIM?

31:15.270 --> 31:17.329
HE'S LIVING IN AN SRO

31:17.370 --> 31:19.509
ON EAST 103rd IN THE CITY.

31:19.540 --> 31:21.235
I'LL LET TARA
AND THE OTHERS KNOW.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.601
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WOULD
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.346
IT MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO

31:25.380 --> 31:28.372
WITH THE NIGHT
YOUR SON DIED.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.217
WE'VE READ
THE POLICE REPORTS,

31:30.250 --> 31:32.081
BUT COULD YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:35.390 --> 31:38.188
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE
CLEAR WINTER NIGHTS.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.357
WE HAD A FUN TIME
SKATING.

31:40.390 --> 31:41.027
HEY, BUDDY.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.459
WE WERE WALKING
TO THE CAR.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.592
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP

31:43.630 --> 31:44.927
CLEANING OUT THE BASEMENT
ON SATURDAY.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.426
I'M GONNA GO GAME
WITH JUSTIN.

31:46.470 --> 31:48.199
THEN WE'RE GONNA
HANG WITH THE GUYS
AT THE BURGER BARN.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.468
YOU CAN DO THAT
ANOTHER TIME.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.331
YOUR FATHER
NEEDS YOUR HELP.

31:51.370 --> 31:54.305
AND DON'T YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS
GO TO THE MALL ANYMORE?

31:54.340 --> 31:56.604
MOM, NOBODY GOES
TO THE MALL ANYMORE.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.301
OK.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.339
SURE, DAD,
I'LL HELP.

31:59.380 --> 32:02.213
ADELE, VOICE-OVER: I SAW
THAT HIS JACKET WAS OPEN.

32:02.250 --> 32:05.344
BRYCE, ZIP UP.
IT'S COLD.

32:05.390 --> 32:06.345
YOU NEED
TO STAY WARM.
I GOT IT.

32:06.390 --> 32:08.187
HEY!

32:08.220 --> 32:09.357
ADELE, VOICE-OVER:
THAT'S WHEN HE SHOWED UP.

32:09.390 --> 32:10.550
COME ON. COME ON.
YOUR MONEY, PHONES.

32:10.590 --> 32:11.557
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU CAN HAVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

32:11.590 --> 32:12.557
MAN: THAT'S RIGHT, DAD.

32:12.590 --> 32:14.023
DON'T BE A HERO.
YOU, TOO.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.493
HERE. HERE, HERE.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.260
THE RING.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.267
ADELE, VOICE-OVER: HE
WANTED MY DIAMOND RING,

32:19.300 --> 32:20.289
BUT IT WOULDN'T COME OFF.

32:20.330 --> 32:21.433
MOM, JUST GIVE HIM
YOUR RING.

32:21.470 --> 32:22.630
I CAN'T GET IT OFF!

32:22.670 --> 32:24.331
STOP PLAYING WITH ME!
GIVE ME THE RING!

32:24.370 --> 32:26.304
MOM!

32:26.340 --> 32:27.568
ADELE, VOICE-OVER: THAT'S
WHEN BRYCE WENT FOR THE GUN.

32:27.610 --> 32:29.032
MITCH!

32:29.080 --> 32:30.570
HEY, KID! KID, STOP!

32:30.610 --> 32:33.101
I SCREAMED
AT MITCH TO DO SOMETHING.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.412
MITCH, DO SOMETHING!

32:38.050 --> 32:39.381
MITCH!

32:39.420 --> 32:41.718
DON'T LEAVE ME, BABY!

32:41.760 --> 32:44.524
NO...OH, GOD!

32:48.230 --> 32:49.390
MITCH!

32:49.430 --> 32:50.624
OH, NO!

32:50.660 --> 32:54.562
HE JUST STOOD THERE.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.467
AND THEN MY BABY WAS DEAD.

32:57.500 --> 33:00.560
ROSSI: AND THE ROBBER
WHO KILLED BRYCE
WAS NEVER FOUND.

33:00.610 --> 33:04.205
AND THAT ATE AWAY
AT MITCH.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.673
AFTER A YEAR,
WE SEPARATED.

33:06.710 --> 33:08.473
I FILED FOR DIVORCE
LAST MONTH.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.340
HOW DID HE TAKE IT?

33:10.380 --> 33:13.110
HE KEPT PUTTING OFF
SIGNING THE PAPERS.

33:13.150 --> 33:14.378
MAN: WHEN ADELE AND I
STARTED DATING,

33:14.420 --> 33:16.411
HE DUG IN HIS HEELS
EVEN MORE.

33:16.460 --> 33:19.588
ADELE: JUST YESTERDAY HE
ASKED IF WE COULD TRY AGAIN,

33:19.630 --> 33:22.019
THAT HE WAS A CHANGED MAN.

33:22.060 --> 33:24.392
CHANGED HOW?

33:24.430 --> 33:29.163
THAT HE WAS NOW THE MAN
I WANTED HIM TO BE.

33:29.200 --> 33:33.330
I SAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS
TO HIM WHEN BRYCE DIED.

33:33.370 --> 33:35.406
YOU BLAMED HIM.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.307
I SAID A REAL MAN
WOULD HAVE PROTECTED
HIS FAMILY.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.478
I TOLD HIM I WISH
HE HAD DIED
INSTEAD OF BRYCE.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.272
MAN: YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.185
BUT I DID.

33:45.220 --> 33:49.452
I WANTED HIM TO HURT
AS MUCH AS ME.

33:49.490 --> 33:51.481
IT'S NOT FAIR, I KNOW.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.693
HE LOVED BRYCE
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.768
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.204
HERE YOU GO, KID.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.501
HEY, THAN KS, MAN.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.370
YOU GOT IT.

34:19.790 --> 34:23.351
HEY, MISTER, CAN YOU
HELP ME GET SOME FOOD?

34:23.390 --> 34:25.483
PLEASE, SIR?

34:28.130 --> 34:30.052
YOU NEED TO STAY WARM.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.090
OK?

34:36.570 --> 34:37.867
HEY, GET OFF ME.

34:37.900 --> 34:39.458
YOU NEED TO STAY WARM.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.273
I SAID, GET OFF!

34:41.310 --> 34:44.108
YOU'RE HIM,
THE GUY WITH THE COAT.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.640
GET OFF OF ME!

34:45.680 --> 34:48.478
LET ME GO! HELP! HELP!

34:54.190 --> 34:55.817
IT'S OBVIOUS
MITCHELL MCCORD FEELS

34:55.860 --> 34:57.179
A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF GUILT

34:57.220 --> 34:58.323
OVER NOT
FIGHTING BACK

34:58.360 --> 34:59.349
THE NIGHT
HIS SON WAS KILLED.

34:59.390 --> 35:00.823
YEAH, BUT HE DID
THE RIGHT THING.

35:00.860 --> 35:01.895
I MEAN, IT'S BETTER
NOT TO CONFRONT

35:01.930 --> 35:04.490
SOMEONE WITH A GUN UNLESS
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.464
WITH HIS MARRIAGE CRUMBLING
AND HIS SON'S MURDER,

35:06.500 --> 35:08.161
IT'S NO WONDER HE SPIRALED
INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.430
JJ: THE TRIGGER MUST HAVE
BEEN ADELE ASKING
FOR A DIVORCE.

35:10.470 --> 35:12.404
THE FAMILY HE LOVED
AND WANTED TO PROVIDE FOR

35:12.440 --> 35:13.566
WAS NOW GONE FOREVER.

35:13.610 --> 35:14.872
THAN KS, MATT.

35:14.910 --> 35:16.275
MITCHELL WASN'T AT HIS SRO

35:16.310 --> 35:17.572
OR THE DENTAL LAB.

35:17.610 --> 35:18.702
SAVALAS: MITCHELL MCCORD
WAS JUST SEEN

35:18.750 --> 35:20.274
DRAGGING SOMEONE
INTO CENTRAL PARK.

35:20.310 --> 35:22.346
THE VICTIM'S DESCRIPTION
MATCHES THAT OF CHAD HIGGINS.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.608
WHERE?

35:23.650 --> 35:25.208
THE PERSON WHO CALLED IT IN
LOST HIM IN THE PARK.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.241
OK, HE'S PROBABLY
TRANSFERRING

35:27.290 --> 35:29.383
HIS NEED TO PROTECT
HIS SON ONTO CHAD.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.389
OK, HIS DELUSION WOULD MAKE
HIM TAKE CHAD SOMEWHERE SAFE,

35:32.430 --> 35:33.920
SOMEPLACE HE COULD DEFEND.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.450
REID: LIKE A DEN. IT'S WHERE
A WOLF WOULD TAKE ITS CUB.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.422
WOLF DENS ARE USUALLY
LOCATED NEAR WATER

35:37.460 --> 35:39.621
ON SOUTH-FACING SLOPES,
AND THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE

35:39.670 --> 35:42.491
ON A NATURAL STRUCTURE,
LIKE A BOULDER
OR TREE ROOTS.

35:42.540 --> 35:45.236
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE AREA
AROUND THE HARLEM MEER
OR THE GREAT HILL.

35:45.270 --> 35:47.329
OK, WE'LL SPLIT UP
AND MEET YOUR PEOPLE THERE.

35:47.370 --> 35:49.429
WAIT. GUYS, I HAVE AN IDEA.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.298
WE JUST MADE CONTACT.

35:53.350 --> 35:55.238
MCCORD'S GOT THE BOY.
HE'S ALIVE.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.372
NOW, I GOT A TEAM
READY TO GO

35:56.420 --> 35:57.739
WITH A STUN GRENADE.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.316
WE CAN DISORIENT MCCORD
AND RESCUE THE HOSTAGE.

35:59.350 --> 36:00.783
IT'S TOO RISKY.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.708
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TRY
AND TALK HIM OUT.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.887
TALK. THIS GUY RIPPED
APART 5 PEOPLE.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.283
YEAH, BUT HE HASN'T
KILLED CHAD,

36:06.330 --> 36:07.888
WHICH MEANS HIS HUMAN
SIDE IS STILL REACHABLE.

36:07.930 --> 36:10.319
PRENTISS: WE CAN USE THAT
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.668
HOW?

36:21.280 --> 36:23.373
CHAD: OH, PLEASE
LET ME GO.

36:23.410 --> 36:24.741
I CAN'T.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

36:24.780 --> 36:26.247
I CAN PROTECT YOU.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.349
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:27.380 --> 36:28.312
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

36:28.350 --> 36:30.614
I COULDN'T BEFORE
BUT NOW I CAN.

36:30.650 --> 36:32.379
YEAH, AND THAT'S GREAT, MAN,

36:32.420 --> 36:34.285
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.389
THE COPS ARE OUT
TH ERE--

36:35.420 --> 36:37.251
MITCH: WHAT GOOD
ARE THE POLICE, HUH?

36:37.290 --> 36:39.520
WHERE WERE THEY
WHEN YOU GOT HURT?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.596
LET ME GO!

36:41.630 --> 36:42.858
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!

36:44.330 --> 36:47.959
MITCHELL? HONEY,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

36:48.000 --> 36:51.265
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.437
ADELE, I'M HERE
WITH YOU, OK?

36:53.470 --> 36:54.630
SAVALAS: I DON'T
LIKE THIS, AGENTS.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.931
GIVE US SOME TIME.

36:55.980 --> 36:59.347
YOU GOT 5 MINUTES.
THEN WE'RE GOING IN.

36:59.380 --> 37:01.416
ADELE, TELL HIM
YOU'RE SORRY

37:01.450 --> 37:04.317
THAT YOU COULDN'T TALK
TO HIM MORE YESTERDAY.

37:04.350 --> 37:08.684
MITCH! I'M SORRY
I HAD TO RUN OFF
LIKE THAT YESTERDAY.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.723
IF YOU WANT TO TALK,
WE CAN DO IT NOW.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.887
I REALLY WANT TO.

37:13.930 --> 37:15.454
LET HIM KNOW NOTHING
WILL HAPPEN TO HIM

37:15.500 --> 37:17.024
IF HE COMES OUT
WITH THE BOY, OK?

37:17.060 --> 37:19.324
BUT HE HAS TO COME OUT.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.503
WHY DON'T YOU
LET THAT BOY GO?

37:24.540 --> 37:27.464
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

37:27.510 --> 37:28.670
THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE

37:28.710 --> 37:30.302
WHO WILL MAKE SURE
HE'S SAFE.

37:30.340 --> 37:33.639
AND THE POLICE PROMISE
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
TO YOU IF YOU--

37:33.680 --> 37:37.411
NO! YOU KNOW THAT THEY
CAN'T PROTECT OUR BOY!

37:37.450 --> 37:38.815
OH, GOD,

37:38.850 --> 37:40.488
HE THINKS BRYCE IS
IN THERE WITH HIM?

37:40.520 --> 37:42.056
ALVEZ: ADELE, YOU SAID
YOU REGRET THE THINGS

37:42.090 --> 37:44.422
YOU SAID TO YOUR HUSBAND ON
THE NIGHT YOUR SON WAS KILLED.

37:44.460 --> 37:45.586
I DO.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.689
HE NEEDS TO HEAR THAT.

37:47.730 --> 37:50.449
HE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T BLAME HIM,

37:50.500 --> 37:53.890
THAT YOU KNOW HE WAS JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT HIS FAMILY.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.028
MITCH, THAT NIGHT
WE LOST HIM...

38:02.080 --> 38:05.447
I WAS WRONG.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.846
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

38:07.880 --> 38:11.338
THOSE THINGS
THAT I SAID,

38:11.390 --> 38:12.687
THEY WEREN'T TRUE.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.518
YOU ARE BRAVE
AND STRONG.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.723
AND YOU WERE
A GREAT FATHER.

38:23.030 --> 38:28.764
PLEASE. BRYCE WOULDN'T
WANT YOU TO DO THIS.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.885
OH, GOD.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.979
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

38:57.760 --> 38:59.899
PLEASE LET ME GO.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.802
COME HERE.

39:12.610 --> 39:13.907
MITCH!

39:13.950 --> 39:15.110
NO.

39:15.150 --> 39:18.540
PRENTISS: MITCHELL,
LET HIM GO.

39:26.060 --> 39:28.426
I'M SORRY.

39:28.460 --> 39:29.950
GO.

39:31.730 --> 39:32.924
REID: PUT YOUR HANDS UP.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.609
JJ: OK. YOU'RE OK.
COME WITH ME.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.505
COME ON.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.171
ALVEZ: CURT SIODMAK WROTE:

40:17.210 --> 40:19.474
"EVEN A MAN
WHO IS PURE AT HEART

40:19.510 --> 40:21.819
"AND SAYS HIS PRAYERS
BY NIGHT

40:21.850 --> 40:24.978
"MAY BECOME A WOLF
WHEN THE WOLFBANE BLOOMS

40:25.020 --> 40:27.944
AND THE MOON
IS FULL AND BRIGHT."

40:35.530 --> 40:39.489
ALL RIGHT, MINNESOTA FATS,
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

40:39.530 --> 40:41.122
I'M MORE OF
A JEANETTE LEE FAN.

40:41.170 --> 40:42.728
OH, BLACK WIDOW.

40:42.770 --> 40:44.499
MM-HMM.

40:44.540 --> 40:45.700
LOSER BUYS BEERS?

40:45.740 --> 40:47.503
YEAH, YOU'RE ON.

40:47.540 --> 40:51.601
HOPE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR WALLET.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.675
MAN: * LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU

40:53.710 --> 40:55.473
* OH, YEAH

40:55.520 --> 40:56.544
* LOVE YOU...

40:56.580 --> 40:57.808
