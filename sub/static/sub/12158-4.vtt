Mike: Hey, Eve!

00:03.771 --> 00:05.337
Could you come out and help me
for a minute, please?

00:05.339 --> 00:06.505
Okay.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.140

[ singsong voice ]
dad?

00:14.215 --> 00:17.182
[ normal voice ]
you out here?

00:18.284 --> 00:20.119
Ha! Gotcha!
Hey!

00:20.121 --> 00:21.120
Damn it!

00:21.122 --> 00:22.688
You have been clipped!

00:23.723 --> 00:25.991
You're in a ghillie suit.
That's no fair.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.893
This is a war game.
What do you mean it's not fair?

00:27.895 --> 00:30.729
Do you think the taliban
has chip clips?

00:30.731 --> 00:32.965
They don't have stuff
like this.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.800
They hate us
for our freshness.

00:36.169 --> 00:38.904
Mike, h-how long are you two
gonna play this stupid game?

00:38.906 --> 00:40.239
It's not stupid.
Honey --

00:40.241 --> 00:43.042
I got fritos here that have
turned into roof tiles.

00:43.044 --> 00:46.145
These tactics could save
our daughter's life in combat.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.815
Great. Another bush starting
an unnecessary war.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.383
Well, this is
for my own good, mom,

00:51.385 --> 00:52.985
If I want to be special ops
someday, so...

00:52.987 --> 00:54.186
That's right.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.422
...Thanks for
pretend-killing me, dad.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.756
You're so welcome.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.259
Now she tries to clip me.
That's how it works.

01:00.261 --> 01:03.228
Maybe you should, uh,
check behind you.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.230
You mean like this?

01:08.902 --> 01:11.737
What the -- what is...?

[ groans ]

01:14.542 --> 01:15.941
Where are you going?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.409
I'm gonna go scare
the mailman.

-- Captions by vitac --

01:26.119 --> 01:27.619
Where's my grandson?

01:27.621 --> 01:30.055
He's in there
on the couch,

01:30.057 --> 01:32.891
But -- but --
but you can't see him.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.059
Okay?
I can't see him.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.928
No.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.531
Boyd.
I can't see Boyd.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.934
I can't see Boyd.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.836
Muffin...

01:45.738 --> 01:47.306
...Did you eat Boyd?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.943
I'm gonna take you
for a long walk,

01:50.945 --> 01:53.445
See if you can't squeeze out
a little kid.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.082
You're not allowed
to eat children.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.484
Grandpa,
I'm right here!

01:58.486 --> 02:01.220
Wait -- wait a second.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.821
There you are,
dressed like a throw pillow!

02:02.823 --> 02:03.989
I didn't even see you.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.757
It's almost on, Boyd.

02:05.759 --> 02:06.757
Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.428
You don't have clearance to use
the remote around here.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.330
Uh, a news crew came out
to talk to some of us

02:11.332 --> 02:12.431
On the picket line today.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.700
Daddy's on strike,
and we're poor.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.769
Boyd, people used to
get along just fine

02:17.771 --> 02:19.638
Without luxuries
like cable tv.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.974
Or meat
or two-ply toilet paper.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.409
Aren't you referring
to the former soviet union,

02:24.411 --> 02:26.011
Which you probably miss?

02:26.013 --> 02:27.846
What the truck drivers
are asking for

02:27.848 --> 02:28.914
Isn't unreasonable, Mike.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.517
It is, considering
a non-union orangutan

02:31.519 --> 02:34.520
Did it in two
clint eastwood movies.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.622
Okay, you know what?
Joke all you want.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.990
But I am fighting
so Boyd doesn't have to grow up

02:37.992 --> 02:39.825
In a world where all the power
is concentrated

02:39.827 --> 02:40.993
Into the hands of a few.
Okay.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.027
I mean, without unions,

02:42.029 --> 02:43.428
We wouldn't even have
a middle class.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.530
For once,
your dad is right.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.964
Years ago,
a kid your age would have to

02:45.966 --> 02:48.767
Work 16 hours,
just like a little slave.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.102
Now go get me something
to drink.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.542
Where did that
come from?

02:56.544 --> 03:00.646
If you're asking that question,
you're already dead.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.514
Oh, here it is!
Man: <i>In its fourth week,</i>

03:02.516 --> 03:04.516

<i>beer-truck drivers</i>

<i>Is stronger than ever,</i>
<i>with no end in sight.</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:07.986
There's daddy, Boyd!

03:07.988 --> 03:08.987
Boyd: Where?

03:08.989 --> 03:09.988
Right there.
You see my sign?

03:09.990 --> 03:13.025
"we're here, no beer,
get used to it."

03:13.027 --> 03:14.993
Well, looks like
a good turnout, honey.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.029
Yep,
it's power in numbers.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.630
Numbers
like on a paycheck?

03:18.632 --> 03:21.133
When was the last time
you saw one of those?

03:21.135 --> 03:23.402
I haven't had trouble
putting food on my table.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.872
Here's your lasagna,
Ryan!

03:26.874 --> 03:28.974
You haven't had trouble
putting <i>my</i> food on your table.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.009
Why are we giving him
lasagna?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.145
Oh, honey, don't worry. You have
another one in the freezer.

03:33.147 --> 03:35.047
Oh, great.
Now he knows where we keep it.

03:35.049 --> 03:38.183
Why don't you just give him
our pin number?
Oh, stop.

03:38.185 --> 03:41.086
Well, I should probably
go to work.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.888
"work" --
there's a word.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.690
Let's say that together,
shall we, Ryan?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.725
Wo-o-o-rk.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.064
Your table is ready,
mr. Baxter.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.699
Great. Thanks.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.367
I will handle
this motley crew, lindsey.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.669
And tell arturo we have
a party of 12 coming in.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.438
Let me show you
to your table.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.740
Hmm.
"let me show you
to your table." fancy.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.741
Fancy.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.909
At the diner,
all we heard was,

04:03.911 --> 04:06.645
"sit down
where it's not sticky."
oh.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.783
Good evening, Baxters.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.385
[ chuckling ] hey, john.
Hey, john.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.386
Hi.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.454
I, uh,
picked you out a nice cab

04:15.456 --> 04:17.122
To start you off with
this evening.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.558
Ooh, lovely.
As long as he calls a nice cab
to drive us home later.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.560
[ laughs ]

04:21.562 --> 04:24.463
Do you have an I.D.,
Mandy?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.898
Not now that you know
my name's Mandy.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.535
And do I need to see your I.D.,
too, young lady?

04:30.537 --> 04:32.738
[ laughing ] okay.

04:32.740 --> 04:36.742
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't wind her up.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.544
That's a check
I'll have to cash.

04:39.546 --> 04:42.914
John, this place
is so beautiful.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.117
You really are
a very impressive young man.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.918
That's after
just one sip of wine.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.387
Two glasses later,

04:48.389 --> 04:50.756
She'll be calling you a monster
who wrecked her body.

04:50.758 --> 04:54.126
You might want to leave
the bottle.

04:54.128 --> 04:57.129
Now, I can't take all the credit
for our success, mrs. Baxter.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.497
I was running on fumes

04:58.499 --> 05:01.600
Until I hired Kristin
to be our manager.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.869
She brings
this place class.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.607
Uh, Ryan, hey.
What are you doing here?
Mike: Boyd?

05:08.609 --> 05:09.908
Hi.
Hey, honey.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.343
Uh, management
finally countered our offer.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.577
That's great.
Ah, great.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.579
Yeah, so, the union called
an emergency vote.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.014
Can you take Boyd?

05:16.016 --> 05:17.416
Uh, I-I'm --
I'm at work.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.917
Well, m-maybe you guys
could take him.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.519
How long do we have to
watch him this time?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.187
An hour? Five years?

05:23.423 --> 05:24.956
It should only be an hour,
but we do have a lot --

05:24.958 --> 05:27.926
Ooh,
is that pretzel bread?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.629
You're gonna be eating with
the adults tonight, all right?

05:30.631 --> 05:33.632
But I know they got something
you like -- snails.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.001
Yeah, they're fresh.
You bet.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.638
I saw them walk around
the sidewalk out front.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.208
This doesn't
look like fun.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.010
I would have had more fun
as clarissa wheaton,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.346

wine orderer.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.682
Oh, hey, Ryan.
Oh, hey.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.682
Mike: He's not staying.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.821
He's doing his best to save
the world from affordable beer.

Compliments of the owner,
an amuse-bouche.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.858
Vanessa: Ooh, salmon.
Yeah.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.326
I love salmon.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.328
Speaking of which, john has been
working day and night

06:03.330 --> 06:04.896
To open his new
seafood restaurant

06:04.898 --> 06:05.997
Out in larimer square.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.132
Proud of you, son.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.533
I hope you don't mind me
calling you "son."

06:08.535 --> 06:10.268
It --
it just seems to fit.

06:12.839 --> 06:17.709
You know, uh, Ryan here
makes his own yogurt.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.911
Oh, Mike, come on.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.913
Yeah, well,
of course the guy can afford

06:21.915 --> 06:24.149
To open a new restaurant --
pays his waiters nothing.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.218
R-Ryan, this --
this isn't the time or place.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.220
Oh, state minimum wage
is $7.78 an hour,

06:28.222 --> 06:30.922
But restaurants pay
their waiters about half that.

06:30.924 --> 06:34.393
Yeah, that's because our staff
does really well on tips.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.694
Here's a tip --

06:35.696 --> 06:38.130
Don't bite the hand
that's literally feeding you.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.400
And just so you know,
kitchen workers don't
get paid sick days,

06:41.402 --> 06:43.402
So there's probably a guy
with the flu right now

06:43.404 --> 06:44.936
Making your $20 salad.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.538
Ha, yeah,
the joke's on you.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.540
I'm gonna have the soup,
okay?

06:48.542 --> 06:51.343
Should, uh, really be getting
to your meeting now, Ryan.

06:51.345 --> 06:52.511
Probably.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.514
Oh, okay. Sorry.

06:55.516 --> 06:59.151
I forgot I was, uh,
talking to "management."

07:01.287 --> 07:03.955
You two must have
a lot of laughs.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.125
They don't.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.936
Boyd, honey,
did you enjoy your dinner?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.705
The macaroni and cheese
tasted funny.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.741
Yeah, yeah, that's 'cause
it had truffles in it.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.110
It's a fungus that pigs root up
out of the ground

07:25.112 --> 07:26.945
With their noses.

07:26.947 --> 07:31.116
I'm gonna go
brush my teeth.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.717
Ha ha! I got --

07:32.719 --> 07:35.821
Hang that up,
will you, please?

07:37.223 --> 07:38.557
Boy, I tell you what,

07:38.559 --> 07:40.125
That john baker puts together
a nice restaurant.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.560
He gave
cinnamon toothpicks.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.928
With those,
you don't even need dessert.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.229
[ chuckles ]

07:44.231 --> 07:46.064
Got those amazing eyes,
too.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.399
Yeah.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.067
Yeah, what are they?
Blue? Green? Hazel?

07:49.069 --> 07:52.237
Whatever.
I was lost in them all night.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.240
You get in line, girl.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.508
[ knocking on door ]
Eve: Ugh!

07:56.510 --> 07:59.010
The doorknob doesn't work
on this side anymore!

07:59.012 --> 08:01.780
Nice try, Eve.

08:01.782 --> 08:05.016
I have school tomorrow.
Just saying.

08:07.987 --> 08:12.190
My favorite customers
are the ones on bad dates.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.259
They never finish
their wine.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.262
So, uh, what are you
in the mood for --

08:17.264 --> 08:19.097
"rejected
marriage proposal"

08:19.099 --> 08:22.133
Or "looked nothing like
his profile picture"?

08:22.135 --> 08:25.504
Hmm. Give me a glass
of "mr. Photoshop."

08:27.273 --> 08:28.473
We had
a pretty good night.

08:28.475 --> 08:29.875
Yeah?
Yeah.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.277
I'm sorry about all the whining
at my folks' table.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.847
I'm talking about Ryan,
not Boyd.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.783
No, you don't
have to apologize for Ryan.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.352
You know, he's in a bad place
right now.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.987
Yeah, well,
we're all in a bad place

08:41.989 --> 08:43.455
If his strike
goes much longer,

08:43.457 --> 08:46.224
And now Boyd has a school trip
to some old-west town.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.027
It's gonna
cost 65 bucks.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.195
Oh.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.664
Well,
look what I just found.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.867
And here's a little extra.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.470
You know, maybe he wants to
stop by the saloon,

08:58.472 --> 09:01.673
Buy himself
a fancy painted lady.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.241
[ chuckles ]

09:03.243 --> 09:06.044
Uh, thank you, john.
But, I mean, no, I was --

09:06.046 --> 09:09.147
I was not shaking you down
for money.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.149
Okay.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.920
But, you know, I was serious
when I told your folks

09:14.922 --> 09:17.255
That you're a big part
of the success of this place.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.859
You and I
are a good team.

09:20.861 --> 09:21.993
[ glasses clink ]

09:21.995 --> 09:24.429
I could kiss you
for saying that.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.833
I wouldn't stop you.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.940
Hey, uh...

09:34.942 --> 09:37.008
Sorry.
[ chuckling ] I have to go.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.277
Sorry, um...

09:39.279 --> 09:41.913
Are you upset?
No.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.182
Yes, I --
but not at you, okay?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.517
I am just so frustrated
with Ryan.

09:45.519 --> 09:48.086
I-I -- I would have never
mentioned kissing you

09:48.088 --> 09:49.955
If I was
in my right mind.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.090
Thank you.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.892
No.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.460
Y-you know what I mean,
okay?

09:55.462 --> 09:57.762
You -- you've been
a great friend,

09:57.764 --> 10:02.133
And I certainly think
you're attractive.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.105
Goodnight.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.774
Uh, shoes.
Thank you.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.043
Yeah.

10:18.484 --> 10:19.484
Hey.
Hi.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.719
What are you
still doing up?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.721
Oh, Eve texted me
that she was in the closet,

10:22.723 --> 10:25.090
So I texted her back
and told her that I love her

10:25.092 --> 10:27.025
And accept her
no matter what.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.496
And then I realized she meant
the coat closet, so --

10:31.498 --> 10:32.731
Uh, yeah, yeah.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.932
Hey.
Hey.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.933
So sorry I'm late.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.935
Oh, Boyd's asleep in there
on the couch.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.103
Where were you?

10:38.105 --> 10:39.604
Yeah,
john keep you after work?

10:39.606 --> 10:42.107
What? No -- no,
why -- why would you say that?

10:42.109 --> 10:45.944
I guess I was just wondering
if john kept you after work.

10:45.946 --> 10:49.948
"the lady doth protest too much,
methinks."

10:49.950 --> 10:51.783
[ chuckles ]

10:51.785 --> 10:54.586
You know, somebody pretty famous
wrote that.

10:54.588 --> 10:58.523
And by tomorrow at 11:00 a.M.,
I have to know who.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.192
Mom, listen, uh,
I need to ask you for a loan

11:01.194 --> 11:03.028
For Boyd's school trip.

11:03.030 --> 11:03.995
[ sighs ]
I'm sorry.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.031
Can we keep this
a d.T.D.?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.633
Don't tell dad what?

11:08.635 --> 11:09.934
Kristin needs money.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.436
Don't tell dad.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.205
How much money
do you need, honey?

11:14.207 --> 11:16.441
Hey, no, wait.
What's this?

11:16.443 --> 11:18.176
We don't need to take
your mom's money.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.011
We're not giving it to you,
we're giving it to her,

11:20.013 --> 11:21.379
And we're keeping it a secret
from me.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.215
What are you doing here,
anyway?

11:24.217 --> 11:27.052
I'm picking up Boyd.
I texted you.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.386
You did not.
I didn't get a text fr--

11:28.388 --> 11:29.954
Oh.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.122
You know, it would be nice
to be able to get a hold of you

11:31.124 --> 11:32.957
Every once in a while.
Why?

11:32.959 --> 11:35.160
Do you have some more insults
you want me to relay to my boss?

11:35.162 --> 11:36.628
Oh, Kris,
when you were a waitress,

11:36.630 --> 11:38.029
You had the same complaints
about management, so don't --

11:38.031 --> 11:39.998
You know, w-when your dad
and I used to fight,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.833
We would take it
down to the basement.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.135
It's just --
it's nice and quiet down there.

11:44.137 --> 11:49.074
And there's a drain in the floor
in case it gets really ugly.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.076
We are not fighting,
mom, okay?

11:51.078 --> 11:53.044
So, is the strike over?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.914
Uh, no. Not quite yet.
They met our wage demands.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.982
But they pushed back
on overtime,

11:57.984 --> 11:59.551
So I convinced everyone to hold
off for the whole package.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.552
Okay,
now we're fighting.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.020
Why would you not accept
that offer?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.221
Because it's not
good enough.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.522
We're not
just gonna cave --

12:04.524 --> 12:05.890
We have $3.48
in our checking account.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.726
I'd say
it's time to cave.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.094
I can't even look at you
right now.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.895

Well, but she's --
ah, no, no, no, no.

I'm thinking she can --
bup, bup, bup.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.736
She can hit him --
zhush-zhush!

12:22.075 --> 12:23.908

where you're going tonight,

see you there.

not to come home.

Hey, Mike Baxter --
here for outdoor man.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.408
Why do people feel like
they need to go with the flow?

12:57.410 --> 12:59.811
I like to chart my own course,

12:59.813 --> 13:04.115
Use my effort to make my boat
go where I want it to go,

13:04.117 --> 13:07.051
But some people love conformity.

Ahh, the communist party.

when everyone is forced

13:13.727 --> 13:16.594
To be exactly the same.

13:16.596 --> 13:20.398
Yeah, and then there are these
poor, stupid bastards --

Adorable little
obama supporters.

universal healthcare's

At the bottom of that cliff.

13:27.506 --> 13:31.609
No. Just little lemming
death panels.

13:31.611 --> 13:36.981
America's great because of
people who think for themselves,

ronald reagan, howard swifson.

Of swifson watercraft,

carbon-fiber canoe paddle.

you could find one.

he couldn't go home.

Maybe a quiz or two.
What's new with you?

15:27.761 --> 15:28.826
Not much.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.895

free healthcare

And what
it's gonna cost me.

to school now.

I'll see you later,
dad.

which I will.

Oh-ho-ho.

to Ryan.

W-w-w-wait, have we really
discussed our options here?

15:56.923 --> 15:59.324
Well, either I bring these
to Ryan, or they go cold.

Either way,
he'll eat them.

is at a crossroads.

maybe it's run its course.

No, no, no,

Don't be
such a pessimist.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.635
You know what?
Kristin is just mad

16:10.637 --> 16:13.504
Because she has to carry
the whole load right now.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.306
And he's not lifting
a finger.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.741
Look, maybe it's time
to look at our options --

16:16.743 --> 16:18.943
Like a handsome guy who owns
his own restaurant?

16:18.945 --> 16:20.311
What? Now,
I am not gonna undermine

16:20.313 --> 16:22.013
Kristin's relationship.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.382
Well, maybe if you stop
feeding it, it'll go away.

16:26.018 --> 16:29.988
It'll be like that mangy,
one-eyed cat we stopped feeding.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.124
Mike, that cat was put down
by animal control.

16:33.126 --> 16:36.194
I don't think we're gonna
get that lucky with Ryan.

16:36.196 --> 16:40.631
They have a child together --
our grandson.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.834
W-we have to root
for their family.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.202
I'm rooting for my family --
Kristin and Boyd.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.636
Do you really think
that guy in there

16:45.638 --> 16:47.205
Is the best possible future
for them?

16:47.207 --> 16:49.007
Yeah.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.975
I am the best possible future
for them, Mike.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.312
'cause no one could love Kris
and Boyd more than I do.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.714
I mean, what, you don't think
that this is killing me?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.017
I can't sleep.
I can barely eat.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.486
You barely ate
a whole lasagna last night.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.888
What do you
want me to do?

17:03.890 --> 17:05.723
I don't know
what I want you to do,

17:05.725 --> 17:07.525
But you can't keep sleeping
on my couch.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.829
I want the memory foam to have
a chance to forget about you.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.065
I'm not crossing
that picket line, Mike.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.200
I didn't ask you
to cross the picket line.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.835
I support your right
to strike,

17:17.837 --> 17:21.339
But I also support you
supporting my grandson.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.141
And I support that,
too.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.346
Just some way to bring home
the bacon or -- or tofu sausage

17:28.348 --> 17:31.916
Or w-whatever
a manly vegetarian brings home.

17:31.918 --> 17:35.053
You're right.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.889
I need to get a job,
something to tide us over.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.924
And I'm just gonna
have to take anything.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.393
Kristin and Boyd
deserve that.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.896
You might
try the post office.

had a mild heart attack Monday.

with my big sis.

18:01.781 --> 18:02.947
Okay, well,
I have a minute.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.782
I just stopped home
to change my shoes,

18:04.784 --> 18:06.417
And then I got to go
pick up Boyd.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.221
Okay. So, uh, how's life?
How's the new place?

18:10.223 --> 18:12.123
Are you sleeping
with your boss?

18:12.125 --> 18:14.125
What? No, what --

18:14.127 --> 18:15.726
What?
Of course not.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.295
Ohh. Oh, okay.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.896
So, I guess that thing
that I saw at the restaurant

18:18.898 --> 18:21.099
Between
you and john was...

18:21.101 --> 18:24.102
Two co-workers
interacting professionally...

18:24.104 --> 18:25.736
Two -- oh.
...In a work environment.

18:25.738 --> 18:26.971
Oh, yeah, totally.

What?

18:29.976 --> 18:32.777
Okay, go -- go ahead.
Stare me down.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.712
That doesn't work on me
anymore.

18:39.985 --> 18:42.320
Okay, we almost kissed.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.554
Damn it!

18:43.556 --> 18:46.090
I have a sixth sense
about these things!

18:46.092 --> 18:48.226
Yeah, but nothing happened,
Mandy.
Yeah, well,
something kind of happened

18:48.228 --> 18:50.128
Because you guys almost kissed.
So, what's up with that?

18:50.130 --> 18:53.331
But I stopped it.
Well, part of me didn't want to.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.934
Yeah, that part gets me
in trouble a lot, too.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.137
Just, you know,
I got caught up in the moment.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.272
John
is an amazing person.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.642
So, what, you're gonna dump Ryan
so you can be with john?

19:04.644 --> 19:05.843
No.

19:05.845 --> 19:09.780
Sometimes I wish Ryan were
more...Motivated.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.984
Like john.
Yes, but still Ryan.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.585
I really do love him.
John?

19:14.587 --> 19:16.087
Ryan.
Oh.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.491
I-I'm not looking for a guy
who's gonna take care of me,

19:20.493 --> 19:23.628
But I also -- I don't want a guy
that I'll have to take care of.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.862
Okay, good.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.797
I have all the information
I need. Let's go.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.099
Uh, where?
It's a surprise.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.834
I need to show you something.
Come on.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.369
Okay.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.703
[ chuckling ]
oh, my god. Stop.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.938
You drove all the way home
to change your shoes,

19:33.940 --> 19:35.940
And that's what you pick?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.775
No.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.352
What are we doing
at dad's store?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.221
Something
you just need to see.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.056
The cleaning crew?

19:52.058 --> 19:53.224
You told me
there was a surprise.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.459
Is -- is one of
these guys gonna strip?

19:57.829 --> 20:00.031
Is that Ryan?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.399
Mm-hmm.

20:01.401 --> 20:04.035
He took a job
as the night janitor...

20:04.037 --> 20:09.207
For minimum wage...
With dad as his boss.

20:09.209 --> 20:12.210
Tell me that guy
doesn't love you.

20:12.212 --> 20:17.215
He always said
he didn't know how to vacuum.

20:32.664 --> 20:36.200
Honey, that was really nice
of you to give Ryan a job.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.935
Oh,
it was the night shift.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.570
I was just doing my part

20:39.572 --> 20:43.608
To make sure the grandchild
population stays at one.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.610
Yep. Goodnight.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.378
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're not done here.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.512
We're not?

20:48.514 --> 20:50.881
Don't I get a reward
for being such a nice guy?

20:50.883 --> 20:53.451
Well, yeah,

20:53.453 --> 20:58.022
As long as nice guys
don't finish first.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.292
You can consider that
a compliment.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.293
[ laughs ]

21:02.295 --> 21:04.895
Oh, god.
I can't take it anymore!

21:04.897 --> 21:08.299
You know what?

21:08.301 --> 21:10.901
I quit.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.903
I quit. You win.

21:12.905 --> 21:16.240
Why did I think this was
a safe place to hide?

21:16.242 --> 21:18.576
I knew that would
flush her out.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.577
Mm-hmm.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.880
Goodnight, babe.
