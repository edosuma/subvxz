WEBVTT

00:37.375 --> 00:38.709
Pretty cool.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.166
Super Skater.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.750
He got any special powers?

00:45.834 --> 00:47.625
He can definitely go invisible.

00:47.709 --> 00:50.500
- How about flying?
- Only on his board.

00:50.583 --> 00:53.250
Without the board,
he's normal. Like us.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.291
How long they been at it?

00:59.375 --> 01:00.583
Just started.

01:00.667 --> 01:03.125
I got out like you said.
Followed the rules.

01:03.208 --> 01:04.917
Always the same thing
with you. Always.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.333
Yeah?

01:10.500 --> 01:12.375
What the hell
are you looking at?

01:12.458 --> 01:14.625
Baby, please.

01:14.709 --> 01:17.375
You got something
<i>boy?</i>

01:19.834 --> 01:22.291
Oh, oh.
Want another piece of me?

01:22.375 --> 01:23.792
Come on.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.500
Baby, come back
inside, okay?

01:27.583 --> 01:29.125
Yeah, I thought so.

01:31.041 --> 01:34.417
- Get in the damn house.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.583
Remember the rules, okay?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.959
It's gettin' like
South Beach in
here.

02:26.041 --> 02:27.375
AC busted again?

02:27.458 --> 02:30.166
Cost-cutting measure. City
wants
us to make do with fans.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.041
I need you to field
this one for me.

02:33.125 --> 02:34.458
Something wrong, boss?

02:34.542 --> 02:36.208
Besides spending
the rest of my morning

02:36.291 --> 02:38.125
filling out budget reports?

02:38.208 --> 02:41.333
- This a grounder or a mystery?
- ME's office kicked him to us.

02:41.417 --> 02:45.291
Thinks he has info on a John
Doe
murder in Brewerytown in '95.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.583
Lilly Rush.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.333
My partner, Scotty Valens.

02:54.417 --> 02:55.834
Hi. Mick Simpson.

02:55.917 --> 02:58.458
Told you got
information
on a John Doe murder.

02:58.542 --> 02:59.875
My brother, Nash.

02:59.959 --> 03:03.417
Ran away spring of '95.
I never heard from him again.

03:03.500 --> 03:07.000
- Ran away from where?
- Gloucester City, New Jersey.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.750
Things at home were, uh..

03:08.834 --> 03:12.083
- Tough?
- Checked with the coroner.

03:12.166 --> 03:15.458
Said you had a
...white male listed back then

03:15.542 --> 03:17.208
about the same age
as my brother.

03:17.291 --> 03:19.125
What makes you think
it's your brother?

03:19.208 --> 03:21.250
My mother just got sent
to court-ordered detox.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.000
And then jail.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.667
Cleaning out the house to put
it
on the market, we found this.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.917
Gonna need to connect
the dots for us, Mick.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.583
Well, my brother
sent this from Philly.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.250
It's postmarked
the second week of June.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.375
- There's no note in the box?
- Just the skateboard.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.625
It must've been for my birthday.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.417
Your mom neglected
to give it to you?

03:39.500 --> 03:43.083
Probably figured, I'd use it
to run away like Nash did.

03:43.166 --> 03:46.542
- It's not him.
- Pretty extensive decomp.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.625
We're gonna need
more than a postmark

03:48.709 --> 03:50.458
and an old photo
to reopen the case.

03:50.542 --> 03:53.166
- Dental, or medical records.
- I don't have those.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.792
There's nothing else
in the file?

03:54.875 --> 03:56.625
Brown-bag special.

03:56.709 --> 03:59.417
Miscellaneous evidence
found at the scene.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.375
Well, I'd like to see
whatever it is?

04:02.458 --> 04:04.834
We don't normally..

04:04.917 --> 04:06.000
It's okay.

04:07.375 --> 04:10.750
My mother had a string
of loser boyfriends.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.166
Not to mention
problems of her own.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.000
Is that why
your
brother left?

04:17.083 --> 04:18.208
He was older.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.458
It was worse for him.

04:20.542 --> 04:23.458
I always thought he'd come back
and take me away with him.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.083
You recognize anything?

04:35.917 --> 04:37.458
Super Skater.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.750
Mean something?

04:41.208 --> 04:42.792
It's from my sketch book.

04:46.709 --> 04:49.000
I gave that to him
the day he ran away.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.166
Well, looks like we
might've
found your brother.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.375
Nash Simpson, 17 years old.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.000
ME estimates he was killed
the last week of June.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.583
Blunt-force trauma,
head and neck.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.125
Body was dumped down
a vent pipe in Brewerytown.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.333
Wasn't discovered
until July.

05:43.417 --> 05:44.917
Filed as a John Doe due to

05:45.000 --> 05:46.917
extensive decomp,
lack of evidence.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.417
Assigned back in the
day,
hit a quick dead end.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.458
No ID, zero witnesses.

05:51.542 --> 05:54.583
Kid jumped by a homeless guy,
or a drug score gone bad?

05:54.667 --> 05:57.625
Tox reports didn't find any
drugs or alcohol in his
system.

05:57.709 --> 06:00.500
Brother Mick confirmed Nash
ran away from home in March

06:00.583 --> 06:03.083
after one too many
bouts
with mom's boyfriend.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.750
Spoke to mom in lockup
over in Jersey..

06:05.834 --> 06:08.500
...a real peach.
Chelsey Simpson.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.834
Told her what happened to Nash.
Got crickets.

06:10.917 --> 06:14.625
- What about the boyfriend?
- Croaked. Hep-C. Real tragedy.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.959
The last contact
Mick had, was a box

06:17.041 --> 06:18.417
his brother sent
from Philly.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.458
Postmarked June, the 9th.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.625
The thing's got some heft.

06:22.709 --> 06:24.166
Blunt-force trauma, huh?

06:24.250 --> 06:26.375
Have forensics take
a look at that, Lilly.

06:26.458 --> 06:27.875
(Miller)
'Got a hit on Nash.'

06:27.959 --> 06:30.125
Issued a bench warrant
for failure to appear

06:30.208 --> 06:32.750
on a summary citation
in the Ninth District.

06:32.834 --> 06:35.208
"City code violation 3261."

06:35.291 --> 06:38.166
"Skateboarding on city
property,
public nuisance.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.875
Arresting officer,
Joe Mueller."

06:40.959 --> 06:42.542
Nightstick Joe.

06:42.625 --> 06:45.166
- Know him?
- Still on the beat.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.250
I'll have him come in.
See what he remembers.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.375
<i>Mijo.</i>

06:54.375 --> 06:57.709
Viejo,

06:57.792 --> 06:59.500
- How are ya?
- Fine.

06:59.583 --> 07:03.125
I was in the area.
Figured I'd bring these
down.

07:03.208 --> 07:06.083
Cross-trainers. Buy one,
get the second pair half
price.

07:06.166 --> 07:07.834
Figured you could use 'em.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.500
- Thanks, pops, uh..
- You got a minute?

07:11.250 --> 07:13.208
Yeah, sure.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.834
- You want some coffee or..
- No, thank you.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.875
- Talk to your mother lately?
- Yeah, last week. Why?

07:22.959 --> 07:25.500
Nay. Probably nothing.

07:25.583 --> 07:28.166
You came all the way down here
to give me a pair of sneakers?

07:28.250 --> 07:29.500
Come on.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.417
She's acting funny.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.166
Isn't where she says, she is.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.333
And when I ask, she lies.

07:36.417 --> 07:38.500
She's taking Tai Chi
in the park.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.959
For God's sake, does that
sound like your mother?

07:41.041 --> 07:43.542
- Tai Chi?
- Says, it relaxes her.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.667
Do you want me to check on her?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.542
I don't know.

07:53.625 --> 07:56.583
Maybe, call her. But don't
tell her we talked, okay?

08:07.625 --> 08:08.875
Done alright for yourself, John.

08:08.959 --> 08:10.709
Makes me wish
I'd taken a few tests.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.500
It's never too late, Joe.

08:12.583 --> 08:14.208
You kidding me?

08:14.291 --> 08:16.166
They just took away
all my overtime.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.250
Hear there's a big shake-up
going downtown with the brass.

08:18.333 --> 08:21.959
- It's above my pay grade.
- Yeah, mine too.

08:22.041 --> 08:25.291
So...what can I do
for you, Johnny?

08:25.375 --> 08:30.667
A citation you wrote
for a Nash Simpson. March,
1995.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.750
Know how many citations
I've written, honey?

08:32.834 --> 08:35.750
It's Detective Rush.
Ten years on the job.

08:35.834 --> 08:38.500
(Rush)
'And this kid ended up
dead in Brewerytown.'

08:38.583 --> 08:39.917
Runaway.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.417
City chews up runaways.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.083
I remember this kid.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.125
One of those Love Park hoodrats.

08:48.458 --> 08:50.709
Cops! Cops! Run!

08:51.917 --> 08:53.458
ID, numbnuts!

08:58.542 --> 08:59.959
No skate parks in Jersey?

09:02.917 --> 09:06.250
- You got a place to stay?
- No.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.625
- You can't sleep in the
park.
- I know.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.041
Not supposed to
skate
here, neither.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.375
Run!

09:13.417 --> 09:15.166
Run, run, run!

09:19.375 --> 09:21.333
Son of a bitch!

09:21.417 --> 09:22.959
Yeah, my sergeant
ripped me a fresh one

09:23.041 --> 09:24.750
over the damage to my vehicle.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.166
Who was the other kid?

09:26.250 --> 09:29.166
Cal...something Mexican.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.375
- I can look it up, if you
want.
- Bad news?

09:31.458 --> 09:33.750
Possession, theft, vandalism.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.250
I caught up with him.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.667
We had a discussion
about the error of his ways..

09:37.750 --> 09:39.417
...if you catch my drift.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.542
Uh, next week's
better for me.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.291
Right.
Talk to you
then.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.375
- Your old man?
- Yeah.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.500
Wants me to meet the family.

09:52.583 --> 09:53.875
Yeah.

09:54.959 --> 09:56.458
(Rush)
'The one with the ink.'

09:57.333 --> 09:59.542
Cal Acevedo?

10:01.750 --> 10:02.917
Depends.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.166
- Nightstick Joe says hello.
- Ring a bell?

10:05.250 --> 10:08.875
More like rang mine a few
times.
Guy had it out for skaters.

10:08.959 --> 10:11.875
Ever skate in Brewerytown
in an old cement factory?

10:11.959 --> 10:14.500
Nah, nothing to skate there.
Love Park was the spot.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.583
How about Nash Simpson?

10:18.375 --> 10:20.166
Haven't heard that name
in a while.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.542
But you guys were buds, right?

10:21.625 --> 10:24.500
Long time ago,
but yeah, we skated.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.417
Nash's body was
dumped there in '95.

10:31.583 --> 10:34.208
- Always figured he split
town.
- What made you figure that?

10:34.291 --> 10:35.709
He was always talking
about going to California.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.333
Figured that's just
where he ended up.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.375
- And he running from
something?
- Just home.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.000
Any idea what Nash was
doing in Brewerytown?

10:42.083 --> 10:43.583
- Looking to score?
- Nah.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.709
Drugs were my cross, not his.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.291
Skaters can be
pretty harsh,
man.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.875
- Fights?
- Happens. Nash was from Jersey.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.458
Dudes 'round here
didn't want the park blown
out.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.417
But me and Nash had
each other's backs.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.333
Where we gonna crash tonight?

11:00.417 --> 11:01.667
Something will turn up.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.625
Right now, my wheels
are flatspotted.

11:04.709 --> 11:06.166
Need new ones.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.166
- Dude, I don't know.
- Watch.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.750
- You bang it, you buy it.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:15.834 --> 11:19.959
Whoa! Dude's got vert playing.
Haven't seen that in a while.

11:21.417 --> 11:22.750
You know him?

11:22.834 --> 11:26.417
Yes. Grady Giles.
Calls himself "Double G"
now.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.625
- He good?
- Best in Philly.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.375
- Planning on paying for
those?
- What?

11:46.625 --> 11:49.250
Don't bring your crap
in here again.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.000
Stealing from another skater.
I mean, where's your head at?

11:52.083 --> 11:53.375
I was-I was
gonna put them back.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.750
Uh-huh. You can tell
that to the cops.

11:55.834 --> 11:58.625
Whoa, relax, man.
We paid for it.

12:08.709 --> 12:11.875
Bailed me out big time.
That was his last 20 bucks.

12:11.959 --> 12:14.709
- Who's Batman?
- Old vert dog, named Hess.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.875
Owned the shop.
Course, he threw me out.

12:16.959 --> 12:19.750
- Hmm, just you?
- Yeah, Hess liked Nash.

12:19.834 --> 12:22.792
Uh, let him crash in the
basement, had him do odd jobs.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.125
How come you didn't stay there?

12:24.208 --> 12:25.417
Did a few times
but the guy was
always

12:25.500 --> 12:26.917
trying to take
pictures of us.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.333
Pictures?

12:28.417 --> 12:30.792
30-year-old guy taking
pictures of shirtless
skaters?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.166
Creepy.

12:42.333 --> 12:45.792
Let me guess.
You're not looking for
boards.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.500
- You see one like this
before?
- No.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.083
Belonged to Nash Simpson.
Remember him?

12:51.166 --> 12:53.667
Back when, yeah.
Good kid.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.709
- Let him sleep in the shop.
- Just for a couple of
months.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.542
Let lots of skaters crash here.

12:58.625 --> 13:01.000
In exchange for what?

13:01.083 --> 13:02.333
What's this about?

13:02.417 --> 13:04.000
Nash was killed back in '95.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.583
Body dumped in Brewerytown.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.458
You like young boys
hanging around, huh?

13:07.542 --> 13:08.709
Huh? No.

13:08.792 --> 13:11.500
Wait a minute,
who-who told you that
crap?

13:11.583 --> 13:12.875
- Cal Acevedo.
- No.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.166
Said you took
a special interest in Nash.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.000
The guy was a junkie, man.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.166
- Nash go down that path?
- Not that I remember.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.709
We're trying to figure out
your relationship to him.

13:22.792 --> 13:25.875
Look, man, Philly was blowing
up
'cause of my shop.

13:25.959 --> 13:28.208
And the connections
I had out west

13:28.291 --> 13:30.625
brought attention
to a lot of good skaters.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.709
- Nash one of them?
- 'Should have been.'

13:32.792 --> 13:36.625
He did stuff back in '95,
dudes are still trying
today.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.500
You messed up my line, kook.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.417
- Come on, Grady.
- Go back where you came from.

13:57.500 --> 14:01.625
Didn't mean to get in the way
of your..."Smith Grind."

14:01.709 --> 14:05.834
The "Smith Grind?" More like
Smith Grind kickflip out.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.834
Fool's gonna
break his face.

14:42.542 --> 14:43.792
That was for free!

14:43.875 --> 14:46.291
And a broken board, no doubt!

14:46.375 --> 14:49.291
- You get that?
- Got it.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.583
Hey, come on, man.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.625
See, Grady thought
he was top dog.

14:57.709 --> 15:01.291
Didn't like Nash coming out
of nowhere, showing him up.

15:01.375 --> 15:04.750
- Grady big-time now?
- Yeah. Big-time sellout.

15:04.834 --> 15:07.709
You can buy his board
at Blue Mart.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.792
Dude forgot where he came from.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.625
Nash steal Grady's girl
like he stole his thunder?

15:12.709 --> 15:15.250
I remember her
coming around the shop

15:15.333 --> 15:17.375
trying to get Nash's attention.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.083
You saying Grady came after him?

15:19.166 --> 15:21.834
All I know
is after Nash
split..

15:21.917 --> 15:24.667
...Vonda got
right back in
line.

15:42.208 --> 15:45.250
- We don't want none.
- How about some of this?

15:48.500 --> 15:49.542
My bad.

15:49.625 --> 15:52.750
Thought you was,
uh, Jehovah's.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.375
Investigating
Nash Simpson's murder.

15:55.458 --> 15:56.834
Sorry to hear that.

15:56.917 --> 15:58.083
Haven't seen that guy in years.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.083
Yeah, when was that?

16:00.166 --> 16:02.750
- Huh?
- Last time you saw him?

16:02.834 --> 16:05.417
Uh, like, way before
our wonderful mayor

16:05.500 --> 16:07.542
decided to ban
skateboarding back in
'01.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.834
- Well, what about Brewerytown?
- What about it?

16:09.917 --> 16:12.041
It's where Nash's
body turned up.

16:12.875 --> 16:13.917
News to me.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.583
Well, here's
another
headline, hotshot.

16:15.667 --> 16:19.208
Heard he was tapping
your girl, Vonda.

16:19.291 --> 16:20.542
Trying to ambush me?

16:20.625 --> 16:22.000
Oh, we're gonna do
a whole lot more than that

16:22.083 --> 16:24.083
if you don't drop
the amnesiac jackass
bit

16:24.166 --> 16:26.583
and start
answering
our questions.

16:26.667 --> 16:29.417
Listen. Dude was good.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.917
Considering he was
a kook from Jersey.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.333
I tried to throw
his boys, a bone.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.375
Fools couldn't get
out of their own way.

16:36.959 --> 16:39.542
20 bucks a deck.
You need one of these, bro.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.625
Fool went and put
rims on his ride.

16:42.709 --> 16:44.166
Where'd Grady get
all that gear?

16:44.250 --> 16:46.000
Accelerator sponsored him.

16:48.542 --> 16:52.250
What's up, fellas? Got two
boards left from my package.

16:53.542 --> 16:55.667
Tail's too square.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.417
At least I got boards.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.291
It's called, "being sponsored."

16:59.375 --> 17:01.834
I go pro, I'll be seeing ya.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.041
No thanks, man.

17:03.125 --> 17:05.083
We're working on our thing.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.000
Yeah, like,
top secret, right?

17:07.083 --> 17:08.375
Said we already
got
our own thing.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.166
We don't need to be
riding your decks.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.166
Alright.
Well, good luck to you.

17:22.792 --> 17:26.250
Real big of you, considering
Nash was getting with your
girl.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.166
Come on, man.
She came back.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.625
They always do.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.458
- Didn't stick?
- No, no, no.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.083
Had to kick her to the curb

17:33.166 --> 17:36.959
'cause she couldn't fathom
the level I operate on.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.792
Hey.
Check out the kicks.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.625
New colorway we're
launching with the..

17:40.709 --> 17:42.291
...video game, energy drink.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.750
Whole package.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.583
Rad.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.250
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's alright.

18:07.583 --> 18:09.917
- Something wrong?
- You hair.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.500
Your father...doesn't like it.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.667
- It's different.
- Oh, you too, now?

18:17.750 --> 18:19.333
Looks good.

18:20.750 --> 18:24.375
Alright.
Enough with the interrogation.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.458
I know he put
you up to this.

18:26.542 --> 18:30.208
What, I can't have
lunch
with my own mother?

18:30.291 --> 18:32.291
Now I know you're lying.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.041
Yeah. He's just worried.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.333
The man worries
about everything.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.000
I'm fine.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.500
Tai Chi?

18:47.750 --> 18:50.083
It helps me get centered.

18:51.417 --> 18:53.166
- Centered?
- Hmm.

18:55.959 --> 18:58.041
So you know this
instructor or..

18:59.375 --> 19:03.375
You and your father...need
to mind your own business.

19:04.625 --> 19:08.917
Do you have any more
questions...or can we order?

19:18.583 --> 19:22.000
Thanks for coming in, Vonda.
You teach photography now?

19:22.083 --> 19:25.959
Uh, photography,
digital arts. Pays the
bills.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.709
Got an old photo here.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.750
Thought you could
analyze this for us.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.583
Nash.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.041
What is this about?

19:35.125 --> 19:38.458
Him winding up dead
in Brewerytown back in '95.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.750
- Dead?
- He was your boyfriend,
right?

19:40.834 --> 19:42.125
We weren't that serious.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.583
When was the last time
you saw Nash?

19:44.667 --> 19:46.667
End of June, I think.

19:46.750 --> 19:50.041
And you thought what,
exactly, when he disappeared?

19:50.125 --> 19:51.166
Stupid.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.417
I let him borrow
my video camera.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.542
And I thought he used me.

19:55.625 --> 19:59.709
'Cause I...I knew how bad
he needed that money.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.417
What's with you
and that logo?

20:12.500 --> 20:14.709
What's with you
and that camera?

20:14.792 --> 20:16.333
I see things.

20:16.417 --> 20:18.125
- Like what?
- I don't know.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.417
Like the way you skate.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.458
Nobody has control like you.

20:22.709 --> 20:24.041
That a good thing?

20:25.583 --> 20:27.834
You attack it.

20:27.917 --> 20:31.917
I mean, somehow,
you make it look beautiful.

20:35.875 --> 20:38.625
I don't really
think about it.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.041
I just do it.

20:49.125 --> 20:50.500
The logo?

20:54.458 --> 20:56.709
My brother made it up.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.875
You have a brother?

20:58.959 --> 21:00.959
He's 13.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.959
I haven't seen him
since I split home.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.583
(Nash)
'He's so talented.'

21:05.667 --> 21:07.959
If you miss him so much, why
don't you just go back home?

21:08.041 --> 21:11.000
I'll just make
things worse for him.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.208
I got to get him
out of there.

21:13.291 --> 21:15.834
Well, you could
have
him live with you.

21:15.917 --> 21:18.375
I sleep on the floor.
I got no money.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.417
Here.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.208
- What's this for?
- Film a part.

21:33.291 --> 21:36.083
Send a "sponsor me video"
to a California company.

21:40.041 --> 21:41.583
I don't know.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.208
Nash, it doesn't-doesn't
matter how good you are

21:44.291 --> 21:46.000
if you don't show anyone.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.834
I'm working on something.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.125
I want to see.

21:52.208 --> 21:53.333
Not ready yet.

21:53.417 --> 21:57.041
But when it is,
you'll be the first.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.709
You promise?

22:03.917 --> 22:05.583
Promise.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.709
The way that he skated..

22:16.792 --> 22:19.667
...Nash would have been
bigger than Grady.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.542
He wanted to get
his brother to Philly?

22:21.625 --> 22:24.417
He couldn't get custody unless
he had a source of income.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.458
A good video
and a few bangers

22:26.542 --> 22:28.375
you could really make
a name for yourself.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.667
- Bangers?
- Tricks.

22:30.750 --> 22:35.125
Guys would spend weeks trying
to nail a trick perfectly.

22:35.208 --> 22:36.875
That how Grady made his name?

22:36.959 --> 22:39.458
Yeah, I have boxes
of tapes of Grady trying

22:39.542 --> 22:42.250
the most ridiculous tricks
over and over again.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.959
- Any footage of Nash?
- Maybe.

22:45.041 --> 22:47.458
I haven't watched those
in years.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.834
We'd like to take
a look at those.

22:53.041 --> 22:57.166
Scotty, you, uh, you
requisition a new fax machine?

22:57.250 --> 23:00.125
- Yeah, it's broken.
- Yeah. Request denied.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.291
- What, we switching to
pigeons?
- Budget cuts.

23:02.375 --> 23:03.959
We're gonna have to make do.

23:04.041 --> 23:05.959
If that's another
expense sheet, Lil..

23:06.041 --> 23:07.125
Phone records.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.166
Got a call from
the skate shop in Jersey

23:09.250 --> 23:10.417
right before Nash was killed.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.166
And next day,
Nash's mom, Chelsey

23:12.250 --> 23:15.417
and the boyfriend, Rafe,
took a road trip to Philly.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.959
Ran their names, got a hit.
Rafe Stockton got into

23:18.041 --> 23:19.625
a bar fight in Brewerytown.

23:19.709 --> 23:21.542
Rearranged some guy's face.

23:21.625 --> 23:23.083
Booked for disorderly conduct.

23:23.166 --> 23:25.250
Simple assault charge
got thrown out.

23:27.875 --> 23:30.875
Alright, pay mom a visit,
see what happened

23:30.959 --> 23:32.709
at the family reunion.

23:56.750 --> 23:59.291
You lied to us, Chelsey.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.667
- What about it?
- You and Rafe were in
Philly.

24:01.750 --> 24:03.375
The week your son was murdered.

24:05.125 --> 24:08.333
Yeah, well.
I don't have to talk to
you.

24:08.417 --> 24:10.583
No, you don't.
It's just your kid who's
dead.

24:10.667 --> 24:12.375
And yet you keep
jerking us around.

24:12.458 --> 24:13.834
Keep it up, I'll have the DA

24:13.917 --> 24:15.792
pile on conspiracy
and extend your stay.

24:15.875 --> 24:18.750
Not like I got
anything
waiting for me out
there.

24:21.875 --> 24:23.750
Well, there's always vodka.

24:24.959 --> 24:27.041
And my mom
liked hers straight.

24:27.125 --> 24:29.375
You know, in those,
uh, plastic bottles

24:29.458 --> 24:31.500
that don't break
when you pass out.

24:32.625 --> 24:34.959
- Gin.
- Mm-hmm.

24:36.792 --> 24:39.625
Hey, I get it, I mean..

24:39.709 --> 24:42.500
...my mom was no June Cleaver.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.166
The messed-up thing was..

24:45.750 --> 24:48.291
...I still loved her.

24:48.375 --> 24:49.834
And in her own way..

24:50.959 --> 24:52.458
...she loved me.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.041
What do you want from me?

24:55.125 --> 24:57.417
I want to know why
you went to Philly.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.583
Because I missed my son.

25:07.667 --> 25:09.125
Hey, baby.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.834
Where's Mick? Thought
you were gonna bring him.

25:16.917 --> 25:19.333
I-I couldn't, uh..

25:21.917 --> 25:23.667
Rafe is here, isn't he?

25:24.750 --> 25:26.792
I told him to stay in the car.

25:26.875 --> 25:29.250
You're wrong about him.
Okay, I mean, he's..

25:29.333 --> 25:31.709
...he's got me on
the straight and narrow.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.333
Is that why you smell like gin?

25:34.750 --> 25:38.041
You ask me to come all this way
so you can judge me?

25:40.166 --> 25:42.667
I want Mick to come
live with me.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.208
What?

25:45.291 --> 25:47.834
You don't know
the first thing

25:47.917 --> 25:49.458
about raising a kid like Mick.

25:49.542 --> 25:51.125
And you do?

25:51.208 --> 25:53.667
I'm gonna get a place
of my own. I got money.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.291
- Yeah, money from what?
- Skating.

25:56.375 --> 26:00.083
- Right.
- Look, I got a sponsor.

26:01.667 --> 26:05.083
Hey, baby, uh, how about giving
me some of that money, 'cause..

26:09.166 --> 26:12.125
Did you ever give Mick
that board I sent?

26:12.208 --> 26:14.000
Uh...I will-I will.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.834
That was the last
time
I ever saw him.

26:27.917 --> 26:29.709
He got money from a sponsor?

26:29.792 --> 26:33.000
Never made any sense to me.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.792
I know he was living
outta some skateboard shop.

26:39.083 --> 26:40.959
- Guy named Hess?
- It could be.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.667
Not a day goes by
that I don't think
about

26:45.750 --> 26:48.166
what I did to those boys.

26:51.583 --> 26:53.208
Now, make it quick, Scotty.

26:53.291 --> 26:55.166
They're waiting for me
on the fifth floor.

26:55.250 --> 26:56.542
Is something going down?

26:56.625 --> 26:58.792
I'm not goin'
for the coffee.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.834
Tracked down the manufacturer
on the skateboard

27:00.917 --> 27:02.667
Nash sent his brother.

27:02.750 --> 27:06.041
Board was a prototype,
custom-designed by Hess.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.500
The first order
was
for 200 blanks.

27:08.583 --> 27:09.917
Hess bet big on Nash.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.792
Same guy was singing
the blues about how

27:11.875 --> 27:13.375
big money ruined
the sport.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.500
Yeah, but the manufacturer
said, Hess canceled the order

27:15.583 --> 27:18.458
June 29 and refused
to pay the rest of his bill.

27:18.542 --> 27:19.959
Yeah, took him
to small claims
court.

27:20.041 --> 27:22.542
After that,
Hess claims bankruptcy.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.083
And Nash winds up dead.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.875
So why're you still standing
here, telling me about it?

27:28.208 --> 27:29.667
What's eating the boss?

27:29.750 --> 27:33.333
Doherty just got appointed to
oversee the Detective's
Bureau.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.375
Wondering if you could
make me one like this.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.208
Capitalize on the sport.

27:42.291 --> 27:45.083
But then again, it might
be
a little late for that.

27:45.166 --> 27:46.333
I get by.

27:46.417 --> 27:48.583
Don't wanna sell
out,
is that it?

27:48.667 --> 27:51.417
Seems like you were
ready to back in '95.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.792
Lot of boards.

27:54.208 --> 27:57.542
- More than I could sell.
- Nash woulda helped with
that.

27:57.625 --> 28:01.083
Seeing as how you'd
tapped him to be a star.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.750
Never happened.

28:02.834 --> 28:04.250
Why is that, Hess?

28:05.333 --> 28:07.917
People, people forget.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.709
This is the place
where it all started.

28:11.792 --> 28:16.041
Without my shop, Philly
never woulda taken off.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.959
I had a plan, too.

28:19.041 --> 28:21.834
Till somebody
beat me to the punch.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.375
Hey.

28:32.458 --> 28:34.542
Check this out.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.792
Just like the one
you sent your brother.

28:36.875 --> 28:39.417
But this one's got
a carbon-fiber ply.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.875
In between the wood,
impossible to break, man.

28:42.959 --> 28:44.542
Cool.

28:44.625 --> 28:48.709
These are high-end blanks, man,
not some Chinese crap.

28:48.792 --> 28:50.125
It's all coming together.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.667
Really?

28:51.750 --> 28:53.458
Yeah, man! And check it.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.458
Your name's gonna be
on every board.

28:55.542 --> 28:58.792
Gonna do it right
as soon as I get the funds.

29:00.125 --> 29:03.917
That sounds awesome, but, um..

29:04.000 --> 29:05.542
...I'm-I'm just getting started.

29:05.625 --> 29:09.458
And this is, this how you do
it,
man. I'll be your sponsor.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.792
- We'll keep it East Coast.
- I can't.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.458
Don't tell me you're not ready.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.250
You're better
than everyone in Philly.

29:15.333 --> 29:19.000
That's not it.
I already got a
sponsor.

29:21.875 --> 29:23.166
What?

29:24.083 --> 29:25.875
Accelerator.

29:27.542 --> 29:29.166
Skated a live demo for them.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.250
They're gonna hook me up
with a board.

29:33.875 --> 29:36.166
- When?
- Yesterday.

29:36.959 --> 29:38.250
Love Park.

29:39.458 --> 29:41.125
I couldn't wait.

29:41.208 --> 29:43.834
If you needed money, man,
all-all you had to do was
ask.

29:43.917 --> 29:47.458
You can barely make the
rent,
Hess. I didn't wanna.

29:47.542 --> 29:51.083
Look, I'm sorry but
I gotta take my shot now.

29:56.083 --> 29:58.542
After all I've done for you?

30:04.458 --> 30:05.834
Just get the hell out.

30:16.291 --> 30:20.750
It's a matter of time
before he got snapped
up.

30:20.834 --> 30:25.875
Bunch of corporate
sharks
buying street cred.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.792
Accelerator was Grady's sponsor.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.750
Made a lot of money
off those kids.

30:29.834 --> 30:31.542
You weren't trying
to do the same
thing?

30:31.625 --> 30:34.041
My stuff had integrity.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.792
Maybe.
But you never saw him again?

30:39.166 --> 30:40.959
Can't say I blame him.

30:42.458 --> 30:45.291
was

30:47.333 --> 30:49.166
Guess I'll always be.

30:51.709 --> 30:54.667
Found some interesting stuff
on these tapes, Vonda.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.959
Need you to put
it together for
us.

30:58.041 --> 31:00.000
You recognize that?

31:00.083 --> 31:01.875
Grady. A long time ago.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.208
Summer of '95.

31:03.291 --> 31:05.667
Time code has him
doing this July
26.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.125
'Kept doing it
over and over'

31:07.208 --> 31:09.750
but never quite
nailed
that banger, though.

31:09.834 --> 31:11.500
Must've been something
he was working on.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.875
No. Tape was in
the box you gave
us.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.208
But some of those
were Grady's.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.041
After we broke up,
he was too famous

31:17.125 --> 31:18.834
to move his stuff out.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.291
What about this?

31:22.375 --> 31:23.709
Nash.

31:24.834 --> 31:25.959
Same trick.

31:26.041 --> 31:29.125
Same place
where we found Nash's
body.

31:29.208 --> 31:33.792
Time code has Nash doing
this trick, June 27.

31:33.875 --> 31:34.834
Nash did it first?

31:34.917 --> 31:36.291
(Vera)
'Yeah, and better.'

31:36.375 --> 31:38.792
A month before yo-yo Grady
even tried it.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.291
Only Nash nailed it.

31:40.375 --> 31:41.959
So Grady stole his trick.

31:42.041 --> 31:43.875
But Grady got
all
the marbles.

31:43.959 --> 31:46.458
Blew up, became
the big man on the scene.

31:46.542 --> 31:48.333
Nothing but a thief.

31:48.417 --> 31:50.125
Or a killer.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.291
(Rush)
'Tough trick.'

32:00.375 --> 32:02.750
Yeah, gotta innovate
and elevate.

32:02.834 --> 32:04.208
It's what I do.

32:04.291 --> 32:07.667
Well, didn't bring you down
here
to admire your innovations.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.959
Remember where
that was, Grady?

32:10.041 --> 32:13.500
Oh, some warehouse.
Oh, that trick was too
sketchy.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.875
Oh, good thing Vonda
held onto it

32:14.959 --> 32:17.166
after you kicked her
to the curb.

32:17.250 --> 32:18.583
Know what's on this?

32:22.500 --> 32:25.333
Check it, man. I look like one
of your psychic friends?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.667
It's bad luck
wearing
a hat inside.

32:29.750 --> 32:32.291
It's a tape of Nash
in Brewerytown.

32:32.375 --> 32:34.834
- Yeah?
- Yeah, same warehouse.

32:34.917 --> 32:36.667
One month prior
to the one you made

32:36.750 --> 32:38.000
trying that exact same trick.

32:38.083 --> 32:40.375
Not being psychic,
but I'd say your future's

32:40.458 --> 32:41.667
mandatory ten-year jolt.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.375
Whoa. That's kook, man.

32:43.458 --> 32:45.250
You're saying
I killed him over that trick?

32:45.333 --> 32:46.959
I told you,
it was too sketchy.

32:47.041 --> 32:49.000
He took your girl Vonda.
You stole his trick.

32:49.083 --> 32:50.083
You saw him stick it.

32:50.166 --> 32:51.583
Decided to take
it for yourself.

32:51.667 --> 32:53.000
No, no, man.
Wasn't like that.

32:53.083 --> 32:55.000
No, you came out top
dog
on the East Coast.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.875
Hooked up with a big-time
sponsor, you never looked back.

32:57.959 --> 32:59.417
The only way you could
have this tape of Nash

32:59.500 --> 33:00.917
was if you were
there that night.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.125
And we got your
lying
ass, same location.

33:06.583 --> 33:07.667
Look..

33:09.458 --> 33:11.375
...truth?

33:11.458 --> 33:13.542
I tried to snake
the trick, alright?

33:14.667 --> 33:16.875
But only off the tape.

33:16.959 --> 33:18.208
The tape? What are
you talking about?

33:18.291 --> 33:21.041
I was never there
when he hit the trick, man.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.709
I wish I was.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.750
Damn, how'd he do that?

33:32.834 --> 33:34.917
It don't matter 'cause he split.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
And what are
you showing me this for?

33:37.083 --> 33:39.542
- You can do it.
- Nah.

33:39.625 --> 33:41.291
You can just add
that Double G
style.

33:41.375 --> 33:42.458
Yeah. Why don't you bust it?

33:42.542 --> 33:44.333
Look, you want the tape or not?

33:44.417 --> 33:45.875
50 bucks.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.125
First I got
to know where this is at.

33:49.208 --> 33:51.875
Come on, man.
I need the
money.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.625
I only got $40.

33:57.709 --> 33:59.166
Brewerytown.

33:59.250 --> 34:02.834
A warehouse we found.
It's totally set up.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.625
Alright. Now, get.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.041
Took me a month.

34:16.125 --> 34:18.875
I still couldn't hit
that trick the way he did.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.458
Why didn't you
get rid of the tape?

34:21.542 --> 34:23.208
I couldn't, man.

34:24.792 --> 34:26.625
That trick was..

34:26.709 --> 34:28.875
...too beautiful.

34:28.959 --> 34:31.291
Now, where'd Cal
get the tape?

34:31.375 --> 34:32.959
Cal was Nash's boy.

34:33.041 --> 34:35.125
I just figured he was there.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.750
Some Jurassic technology, huh?

34:43.834 --> 34:46.625
Unless you want to spring
to have the tape analyzed.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.834
It's not up to me, Lil.

34:48.917 --> 34:51.583
I heard about Doherty.

34:51.667 --> 34:54.834
Just have to do
the job better with
less.

35:09.917 --> 35:11.250
Have a seat, Cal.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.542
What?

35:19.625 --> 35:22.166
Well, innocent
guys don't just take a
seat.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.667
Deep down, you knew
this day was coming,
Cal.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.375
- Lost a lot of years to
drugs.
- I made no secret of that.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.667
Probably don't remember some
of the stuff you did to
score.

35:30.750 --> 35:34.166
Popped for meth twice,
five months in county

35:34.250 --> 35:36.333
caught jacking car stereos.

35:36.417 --> 35:38.375
I told you,
those days are behind me.

35:38.458 --> 35:40.542
Yeah, but this ain't.

35:41.792 --> 35:43.542
Want to know
what's on
there?

35:45.959 --> 35:47.041
Why don't you tell me?

35:47.125 --> 35:48.875
It's footage
of your best
friend's

35:48.959 --> 35:50.291
last night on Earth.

35:50.375 --> 35:54.041
June 27. Warehouse
in Brewerytown. Remember that?

35:54.125 --> 35:55.000
No.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.542
Come on, Cal.

35:56.625 --> 35:59.208
That night Nash
skated that
line?

35:59.291 --> 36:01.375
- Tore it up.
- It's epic stuff.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.875
I mean, so good you sold
the tape of it to Grady.

36:03.959 --> 36:05.000
I don't know
what you're talking
about.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.792
- I wasn't there.
- Hmm.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.917
Well, in that case

36:10.000 --> 36:12.458
you won't mind if
we get a voice
read.

36:14.667 --> 36:15.542
For what?

36:15.625 --> 36:16.583
Well, need to match a voice

36:16.667 --> 36:18.750
our techs
discovered
on the tape.

36:22.500 --> 36:25.291
Say "Nash" into the mic.

36:32.333 --> 36:34.583
Well, we know you
were there that night.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.375
But what we can't figure is

36:36.458 --> 36:38.083
why you'd sell
the tape to Grady.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.917
The only way you'd sell
out
a friend like that

36:40.000 --> 36:43.333
was if you knew
he wasn't coming
back.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.000
- Well, just say your
friend's--
- I'm not going to do that.

36:49.083 --> 36:51.125
I want to hear you say it.

36:51.208 --> 36:53.625
You were there.
We know you were there.

36:53.709 --> 36:55.000
Maybe I was.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.083
Nash tell you he
signed
with Grady's sponsor?

36:59.166 --> 37:00.709
I heard it
from somebody else.

37:00.792 --> 37:02.667
But you and him were gonna do
your own thing.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.083
- Was that it?
- We were a team.

37:04.166 --> 37:06.625
But he ditched you,
forgot all about your
plans.

37:06.709 --> 37:09.875
I didn't have
what he had. Nobody did.

37:09.959 --> 37:11.542
He left you
with
nothing.

37:11.625 --> 37:14.333
That why you sold this
tape
and the trick to Grady?

37:14.417 --> 37:16.583
The guy you hated?

37:16.667 --> 37:19.875
You could have hit that trick,
made a name for yourself.

37:19.959 --> 37:21.333
No.

37:21.417 --> 37:23.875
- No what, Cal?
- I couldn't do it.

37:23.959 --> 37:26.959
Not then. Not after.
Not ever.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.583
And he was leaving me behind.

37:45.333 --> 37:46.625
Been looking for that.

37:46.709 --> 37:48.166
Come all the way
down here just to make
sure

37:48.250 --> 37:50.083
I didn't sell Vonda's camera?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.208
What are you doing?

37:52.291 --> 37:55.458
What's it look like?
Working on the trick.

37:55.542 --> 37:57.709
Something else
you want to tell
me.

37:57.792 --> 37:59.875
Like how you
signed
with Accelerator?

38:04.291 --> 38:06.458
I need the money, Cal.

38:06.542 --> 38:08.166
Going to try and get a place

38:08.250 --> 38:09.792
have my brother move in with me.

38:09.875 --> 38:12.166
Sure. Why not?
Big-time now.

38:12.250 --> 38:15.250
Ain't like
that,
man. I'll be
back.

38:21.750 --> 38:23.625
- Your foot's too far back.
- Oh, you think?

38:23.709 --> 38:25.709
- Just try it.
- I've been trying.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.792
You tweakin'?

38:27.875 --> 38:28.875
What's that matter to you?

38:28.959 --> 38:29.959
Maybe if you stopped
with the junk

38:30.041 --> 38:31.333
you'd be able to nail it.

38:31.417 --> 38:33.667
Maybe you should stop
giving me advice, bro.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.792
I thought we were going
to work on this thing
together.

38:40.875 --> 38:42.166
We can still do the video.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.500
Not if you're
signed
with Accelerator.

38:43.583 --> 38:45.417
Get this trick.
I'll show it to them.

38:45.500 --> 38:48.250
I guarantee
they'll sign you.

38:48.333 --> 38:49.709
Yeah, right.

38:49.792 --> 38:51.375
Yeah.

38:51.458 --> 38:53.125
Right.

39:01.667 --> 39:02.792
Alright. Let's go.

39:02.875 --> 39:05.333
Just get more speed
and keep your foot
back.

39:08.458 --> 39:09.917
Keep your foot back.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.834
Again. Do it again.
Come on, Cal.

39:19.208 --> 39:20.625
Hey, you think
it's so easy
here.

39:20.709 --> 39:22.000
You try it, big shot.

39:22.083 --> 39:23.875
No. I-it's yours.

39:25.625 --> 39:26.959
I got to think
of something
else.

39:27.041 --> 39:30.000
I'm just tired
of busting my
head.

39:30.083 --> 39:32.333
- Come on, Cal.
- No. You don't get it.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.834
I can't do it.

39:34.917 --> 39:37.709
Alright? I can't.
