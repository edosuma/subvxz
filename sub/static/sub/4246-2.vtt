WEBVTT

00:00.531 --> 00:02.331
After she murdered
these seven people

00:02.335 --> 00:06.168
Lindsay Dywer ran away, changed
her name to Quinn Perkins,

00:06.186 --> 00:07.469
and started a new life.

00:07.487 --> 00:08.871
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:08.905 --> 00:10.623
The government has failed
to prove its case.

00:10.657 --> 00:11.641
What the hell?!

00:11.675 --> 00:13.659
- Order.
- Your honor, on what grounds?

00:13.693 --> 00:15.861
I said this case is over.
(Gavel bangs)

00:15.913 --> 00:18.514
Olivia obviously knows
something we don't.

00:18.548 --> 00:21.050
The agency took stuff from me.

00:21.084 --> 00:23.836
I was young. They made it sound fun.
(Whirring)

00:23.870 --> 00:27.440
(Man) If you meet this guy
in a dark alley, you're done.

00:27.474 --> 00:29.291
Are you moving on east Sudan?

00:29.309 --> 00:30.326
I'm not discussing
foreign policy with you.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.944
- What's the delay, Fitz?
- Son of a...

00:31.979 --> 00:33.062
There's only one leader
of the armed forces,

00:33.096 --> 00:34.797
and his name is
Fitzgerald Grant.

00:34.831 --> 00:37.867
If you go to war, it's because
you want to go to war.

00:37.901 --> 00:40.753
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

00:43.941 --> 00:46.742
(Telephone rings)

00:49.746 --> 00:51.647
(Ring)

00:53.365 --> 00:54.682
23 people.

00:54.716 --> 00:55.766
(Fitz) What?

00:55.801 --> 00:57.151
When you stay late
in the oval, there are

00:57.169 --> 00:59.103
23 members of your staff
that have to stay late, too.

00:59.137 --> 01:00.888
I'm reading briefs
on east Sudan.

01:00.922 --> 01:02.740
They can't go home
until you do.

01:02.791 --> 01:03.908
How are you?

01:03.959 --> 01:05.108
Richard, Jo,

01:05.143 --> 01:06.460
Marybeth, Ted, Hank,

01:06.495 --> 01:08.129
that guy with the briefcase
handcuffed to his wrist,

01:08.163 --> 01:10.548
Jose the chef, Kayla, Susan...

01:10.582 --> 01:12.099
Susan went
to the state department

01:12.133 --> 01:13.267
and the briefcase guy is Rashid.

01:13.302 --> 01:15.102
I'm saying that 23
hardworking Americans

01:15.137 --> 01:16.404
are staying late at night

01:16.438 --> 01:17.672
so you can call me.

01:17.806 --> 01:19.640
You want me to hang up?

01:24.746 --> 01:25.913
How are you?

01:25.947 --> 01:27.214
I'm serving up my sentence

01:27.249 --> 01:30.516
in the crown jewel of the
American prison system.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.500
How are you?

01:31.551 --> 01:32.685
Fine,

01:32.719 --> 01:34.654
except my married ex-boyfriend
keeps calling me.

01:34.688 --> 01:36.956
This is friendly.
We're being friends.

01:36.990 --> 01:38.557
We're not friends.

01:38.592 --> 01:40.192
We're <i>good</i> friends.

01:40.227 --> 01:42.061
How's your pregnant wife?

01:44.097 --> 01:46.699
Whose fault is that?
Who fixed that for me?

01:46.733 --> 01:49.435
(Sighs deeply)

01:49.469 --> 01:52.638
Tell me to stop calling.

01:52.673 --> 01:57.109
Tell me you don't want
to hear from me.

01:58.812 --> 01:59.912
Okay, then.

01:59.947 --> 02:01.948
I'll speak to you
tomorrow night.

02:01.982 --> 02:02.915
(Line disconnects)

02:02.950 --> 02:04.550
(Sighs)

02:06.253 --> 02:07.320
(Sighs)

02:07.354 --> 02:08.487
(Telephone rings)

02:08.521 --> 02:11.023
Aah!

02:11.058 --> 02:12.992
(Sighs) (Ring)

02:13.026 --> 02:15.962
Stop calling.
I don't want to hear from you.

02:20.167 --> 02:22.301
Take a deep breath and
say that one more time.

02:22.336 --> 02:23.736
(Clasp clicks)

02:23.770 --> 02:27.073
And then she just goes,
"Jill, dad died six months ago."

02:27.107 --> 02:30.643
I was so wasted, you know,
I-I guess I forgot.

02:30.711 --> 02:33.746
(All) Thanks, Jill.

02:33.780 --> 02:37.950
(Man) Would anyone else
like to share tonight?

02:37.985 --> 02:39.518
What about you in...
in the back?

02:39.553 --> 02:42.855
(Cell phone buzzes)

02:42.889 --> 02:45.558
Uh, no, thanks.

02:50.695 --> 02:53.464
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

02:54.766 --> 02:56.200
Don't you ever sleep?

02:56.234 --> 02:58.736
- I have work. You're the one who...
- I slept better in prison.

02:58.770 --> 02:59.870
There are extra pillows...

02:59.905 --> 03:01.505
It's not the pillows.

03:01.539 --> 03:04.375
- Quinn, your story isn't dying
down yet. - So what?

03:04.409 --> 03:05.609
You saved my life.
I know that,

03:05.644 --> 03:07.878
but I still don't know how or why,

03:07.913 --> 03:09.380
and until you tell me,
I might as well

03:09.414 --> 03:10.981
still be wearing that
freaking orange jumpsuit.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.349
You want answers?
Fine. You'll get them.

03:12.384 --> 03:13.767
But you have to trust
me when I tell you

03:13.818 --> 03:15.185
it's in your own best interest

03:15.203 --> 03:16.620
that you don't have every piece
of the puzzle right now.

03:16.638 --> 03:18.555
If you change your mind
about sleep,

03:18.573 --> 03:21.875
pillows are in the closet.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.477
(Projector and camera shutter click)
- Right reverend Marvin Drake...

03:24.478 --> 03:26.946
68-year-old civil rights leader,
gay marriage crusader,

03:26.997 --> 03:28.182
- our nation's pastor.
- Everyone knows who pastor Drake is.

03:28.216 --> 03:30.583
Well, his wife doesn't know
where he is. He's missing,

03:30.584 --> 03:31.934
and he's supposed to be at the
National Prayer Breakfast

03:31.952 --> 03:32.635
with the President

03:32.636 --> 03:35.204
and the important half
of congress in nine hours.

03:35.205 --> 03:36.155
Since he officiated
that mass gay marriage

03:36.206 --> 03:37.373
in the national mall
last spring,

03:37.391 --> 03:38.958
he's had over a hundred
death threats.

03:38.992 --> 03:39.942
So much for turning
the other cheek.

03:39.976 --> 03:40.943
He's always home by 9:00.

03:40.977 --> 03:42.795
He pours his sherry,
reads a verse or two,

03:42.830 --> 03:44.514
asleep by 10:00,
like clockwork.

03:44.548 --> 03:46.699
I know that it hasn't been
long enough to call the police,

03:46.750 --> 03:49.218
and I know what a news
story it'll be if I do,

03:49.253 --> 03:52.788
but I'm telling you, Olivia,
something has happened to him.

03:52.806 --> 03:54.107
I can feel it.

03:54.141 --> 03:55.591
No luck at the shelter.

03:55.609 --> 03:57.093
Nothing on the police scanners.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.362
No sign at his church or office.

03:59.396 --> 04:02.298
(Cell phone ringing)

04:04.368 --> 04:06.836
(Ringing stops)

04:08.270 --> 04:10.288
Please be dying.
Are you dying?

04:10.322 --> 04:13.708
David, pastor Marvin Drake
is missing.

04:13.726 --> 04:15.810
I know I'm the last person you'd
do a favor for right now, but...

04:15.845 --> 04:17.295
A favor?

04:17.329 --> 04:18.579
Oh, I'd love to,
but the thing is,

04:18.596 --> 04:21.148
I just lost the highest-profile
trial of my life,

04:21.166 --> 04:22.550
and with it, any and all juice
I may have had

04:22.585 --> 04:24.652
in the professional favor
department.

04:24.687 --> 04:27.522
So even if I could help you, even
if I <i>wanted</i> to help you,

04:27.556 --> 04:29.674
which I don't...
that was sarcasm before...

04:29.708 --> 04:32.627
The days of favors from me

04:32.661 --> 04:34.379
are very, very over.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.447
At 8:14, he withdrew $500
from an A.T.M.

04:36.482 --> 04:38.966
On the corner of Connecticut
and "K" street.

04:39.000 --> 04:39.633
What's nearby?

04:39.668 --> 04:40.901
- Something called Camelot.
- Strip club.

04:40.936 --> 04:42.853
- What's the scorpion room?
- Gay bar.

04:42.888 --> 04:44.205
The Adams Morgan hotel
is across the street.

04:44.239 --> 04:45.756
Married dude pays for
a hotel room in cash,

04:45.790 --> 04:47.708
nine times out of ten, he's
getting it in with a hooker.

04:47.726 --> 04:50.861
Let's get all the facts before we jump
to conclusions, people. (Clatter)

04:50.896 --> 04:52.062
(Beep)

04:52.113 --> 04:54.448
Pastor Drake, are you in there?

04:54.482 --> 04:57.818
(Muffled moaning)

04:57.852 --> 04:59.320
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

04:59.354 --> 05:01.655
Oh, God. Okay.
We really shouldn't...

05:01.689 --> 05:02.656
This is so wrong.

05:02.690 --> 05:04.024
Wait.
Huck?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.577
Cold, no pulse, probably been
dead a couple of hours.

05:06.628 --> 05:08.379
Well, we found him.

Ethiopia's closing.

05:23.812 --> 05:25.229
What? What?

05:25.263 --> 05:27.097
We waited too long.
Ethiopia's closing.

05:27.148 --> 05:28.365
We can't get a baby
from there now,

05:28.400 --> 05:29.667
unless you can pull
some strings.

05:29.701 --> 05:31.151
- Can you pull some strings?
- Sweetheart...

05:31.186 --> 05:33.520
Frankly, I think we should go
for a domestic adoption.

05:33.554 --> 05:36.874
There are a lot of babies in our
own backyard who need homes.

05:36.908 --> 05:38.525
It's 5:00 A.M.

05:38.559 --> 05:39.860
I quit my job, Cyrus.

05:39.894 --> 05:41.495
I'm an award-winning
journalist, and I...

05:41.529 --> 05:44.782
Oh, you won one award
in college.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.334
It wasn't even Ivy league.
For God sake...

05:47.369 --> 05:49.203
I was on the short list
for the Pulitzer in 2009.

05:49.237 --> 05:50.754
That's like winning.

05:50.789 --> 05:53.757
I quit my job to stay at
home and take care of you

05:53.842 --> 05:55.542
and the fat, smushy baby that
you said that we could have.

05:55.576 --> 05:58.429
But there's no baby.
Where's the baby, Cy?

05:58.463 --> 05:59.596
You've been dragging your feet.

05:59.631 --> 06:01.932
That ends now.
I want a baby.

06:03.584 --> 06:05.752
And Middlebury is just as
good as the Ivy league,

06:05.770 --> 06:09.056
you elitist, highbrow,
conservative snob.

06:09.090 --> 06:12.309
I cannot believe I fell in love
with a republican!

06:12.360 --> 06:16.596
Being on the short list
is not "like" winning.

06:16.614 --> 06:18.449
Winning is like winning!

06:18.483 --> 06:21.118
Baby!

06:21.152 --> 06:22.703
(Woman) I have to go.

06:22.737 --> 06:24.938
I-I-I-I really have to...

06:24.956 --> 06:26.040
I-I can't...

06:26.074 --> 06:27.241
What's your name?

06:27.275 --> 06:28.659
- Anna.
- Listen to me, Anna.

06:28.710 --> 06:30.444
You're in shock. You need to
sit down, drink some water,

06:30.462 --> 06:32.446
and relax for a minute.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.216
(Door opens)

06:36.251 --> 06:38.002
We need to get him out of here.

06:38.053 --> 06:39.887
Really? We shouldn't just maybe
get rid of the lady of the night

06:39.921 --> 06:41.138
and then call the cops?

06:41.172 --> 06:42.723
Marvin Drake is the most
respected religious leader

06:42.757 --> 06:44.091
in our country.

06:44.125 --> 06:45.392
He was naked and dead on top
of a handcuffed hooker.

06:45.427 --> 06:47.478
I think he just lost
the title, Liv.

06:47.512 --> 06:50.514
How do I tell the congregation?

06:50.565 --> 06:52.966
What the hell am I supposed
to say to our children?

06:52.984 --> 06:54.968
Your children will never know,

06:54.986 --> 06:56.770
and the pastor's legacy
will remain intact.

06:56.804 --> 06:58.322
We'll make sure of it.

06:58.356 --> 06:59.840
Harrison, Anna needs to stay quiet.

06:59.874 --> 07:01.191
Pay her whatever it takes.

07:01.242 --> 07:02.609
Help me find the nearest route
to the freight elevator.

07:02.643 --> 07:04.978
Huck, what are you gonna
need to take care of this?

07:06.448 --> 07:09.917
Uh, latex gloves, a 24-inch bone saw,

07:09.951 --> 07:12.036
a skull chisel, an
industrial meat cleaver,

07:12.087 --> 07:15.422
three dozen heavy-duty trash
bags, ten bath towels,

07:15.457 --> 07:20.344
a 30-foot roll of plastic wrap, and
two black coffees, extra tall.

07:20.378 --> 07:22.346
It's gonna be a long day.

07:22.380 --> 07:25.665
I want you to move him,
not dispose of him.

07:25.683 --> 07:27.017
Oh.

07:27.052 --> 07:29.019
Well, in that case,
I'll just need, uh,

07:29.054 --> 07:32.356
six king-size sheets
and lots of ice.

07:33.841 --> 07:35.509
Standard nondisclosure.

07:35.527 --> 07:36.777
Sign, tell me whatever you're
supposed to make for the night

07:36.811 --> 07:38.562
so I can add a few grand on top

07:38.613 --> 07:40.447
and we can forget this
ever happened. Hmm?

07:40.482 --> 07:42.449
(Projector and camera shutter click)

07:42.484 --> 07:44.168
Look, they're not gonna
hand over the...

07:44.235 --> 07:45.702
I don't want to your money.

07:47.655 --> 07:49.373
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

07:53.661 --> 07:54.745
Mm.

07:54.796 --> 07:56.863
- Huck.
- He's ready.

08:17.519 --> 08:19.736
Thank you.

08:19.771 --> 08:21.888
Thank you so much
for bringing him home.

08:23.191 --> 08:26.043
I'm sorry, Nancy, but it's time.

08:27.612 --> 08:29.613
Um...

08:29.664 --> 08:31.198
I put my nightgown on.

08:31.232 --> 08:32.416
- I...
- Put your nightgown on,

08:32.450 --> 08:33.784
and you get into bed.

08:33.835 --> 08:36.587
Toss around a little, then
you get up, and call 9-1-1.

08:36.621 --> 08:39.423
He was asleep when you came in
and dead when you woke up.

08:39.457 --> 08:40.506
That's all you know.

08:40.542 --> 08:42.126
That's all I know, yes.

08:42.177 --> 08:44.628
You'll do great.
Talk to you soon.

08:50.385 --> 08:51.468
(Cell phone rings and buzzes)

08:51.519 --> 08:53.187
We just had to carry
300 pounds of pastor

08:53.221 --> 08:56.106
up a flight of stairs and put
him to bed. Where are you?

08:56.141 --> 08:57.441
(Harrison) Alexandria.

08:59.711 --> 09:00.694
She wouldn't sign the
nondisclosure agreement.

09:00.728 --> 09:01.862
She wouldn't take the cash.

09:01.896 --> 09:03.981
Liv, I don't think
she's a hooker.

09:04.032 --> 09:06.216
She's the pastor's mistress.

09:09.653 --> 09:11.253
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

09:11.254 --> 09:12.971
- Morning, Mr. President.
- Why didn't I know about that photo?

09:13.005 --> 09:14.840
I found out this morning,
sir, just like you.

09:14.874 --> 09:16.341
And why don't I believe that?

09:16.375 --> 09:17.993
(Indistinct conversations)

09:18.044 --> 09:20.128
What am I looking at?

09:22.431 --> 09:24.332
My God.

09:25.651 --> 09:26.651
Who did this?

09:26.686 --> 09:28.319
(Man) Government of east Sudan.

09:28.337 --> 09:29.554
Confirmed by?

09:29.588 --> 09:31.039
Our analysts at Langley, sir.

09:31.073 --> 09:33.108
(Clears throat)

09:33.142 --> 09:34.693
Mr. President, we were
able to date the photo

09:34.727 --> 09:36.127
to three days ago.

09:36.162 --> 09:37.496
Based on the environment,

09:37.530 --> 09:38.997
the location's in the
southwestern region,

09:39.031 --> 09:41.915
near a village called Sinkala.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.001
(Woman) Sinkala is an
opposition stronghold,

09:44.035 --> 09:46.153
and the government is
blaming the rebels.

09:46.187 --> 09:47.287
All kids?

09:47.322 --> 09:48.221
Without live assets
on the ground, sir,

09:48.256 --> 09:49.656
it's hard to say.

09:49.691 --> 09:51.124
We'll keep working on it,
but it doesn't look good.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.709
Gather the joint chiefs.

09:52.727 --> 09:56.363
I want military options
on my desk by noon.

09:56.431 --> 09:57.648
(All murmuring)

09:57.682 --> 10:00.150
You okay, son?

10:00.168 --> 10:01.702
Yes, sir.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.005
(Camera shutter clicks)
Anna Gordon... 38, works as lawyer

10:06.056 --> 10:07.740
at the national
tolerance foundation.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.324
So she's a professional
civil rights activist.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.310
And a hate group educator

10:11.344 --> 10:12.878
and a regular churchgoer,
and in her spare time,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.430
she runs a canned food drive
at a women's shelter.

10:14.464 --> 10:15.598
So she's a saint.

10:15.632 --> 10:16.699
Well, a saint who was...

10:16.733 --> 10:18.500
(Sniffs) Sleeping
with a married man.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.319
A saint who enjoys being
handcuffed to a bed,

10:20.370 --> 10:22.904
- just like mother Teresa.
- Maybe she didn't know he was married.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.072
She didn't know he was married?

10:24.073 --> 10:24.640
The pastor's cell phone

10:24.674 --> 10:26.108
has calls to Anna
going back 15 years.

10:26.143 --> 10:28.010
E-mails, they met in
hotel rooms, secret weekends.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.611
- 15 years. - <i>15 years.</i>
She probably thought

10:29.629 --> 10:31.630
he was gonna leave his wife.
He wasn't gonna leave his wife.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.883
They never leave their wives.
What was she thinking?

10:33.917 --> 10:35.518
- We don't...
- Not judging. Just <i>saying...</i>

10:35.552 --> 10:37.053
Think she called "The
Enquirer" for a payday?

10:38.387 --> 10:39.921
15 years.

10:39.955 --> 10:41.539
She could've had a
payday a long time ago.

10:41.573 --> 10:42.740
She loved him,

10:42.775 --> 10:44.509
and that means she cares
how all this plays out.

10:44.543 --> 10:45.760
Abby, you're on the funeral.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.495
Make sure it goes off
without a hitch.

10:47.529 --> 10:49.130
You want me to cancel
on justice Thornton?

10:49.164 --> 10:50.565
We'll have our hands
full with this one.

10:50.599 --> 10:52.650
She's a supreme court justice.
We can't cancel on her.

10:52.684 --> 10:53.934
Plus she hates doing press.
She needs me.

10:53.952 --> 10:55.153
Harrison, you're on cleanup.

10:55.204 --> 10:56.421
How squeaky clean we need to be?

10:56.455 --> 10:58.606
Everyone in the city who
knows about the affair...

10:58.640 --> 10:59.840
- Make sure they don't breathe
a word about it. - Got it.

10:59.858 --> 11:01.125
Will you check on Quinn for me?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.427
See if she's okay?
See if she needs anything?

11:02.478 --> 11:04.812
She was going a little
stir-crazy this morning.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.848
Thank you, senator.
All right.

11:06.882 --> 11:08.783
You're busy these days,

11:08.817 --> 11:10.584
working late, up early.

11:10.602 --> 11:12.086
I'm running a country.
(Hangs up receiver)

11:12.121 --> 11:14.088
I can see that.

11:20.445 --> 11:21.495
Fitz...

11:21.529 --> 11:23.530
Can we just skip to the end?

11:23.564 --> 11:25.532
- Excuse me?
- You come in...

11:25.566 --> 11:27.384
(Hangs up receiver) I hear how I'm
failing you, I yell, you yell,

11:27.418 --> 11:29.069
I feel guilty for yelling at
the mother of my children,

11:29.103 --> 11:30.671
I apologize, you're cold,
and then you leave.

11:30.705 --> 11:32.773
Can we skip
right to you leaving?

11:34.842 --> 11:36.693
Reverend Drake died
of a heart attack this morning.

11:36.728 --> 11:38.045
I wanted you
to hear it from me,

11:38.112 --> 11:39.579
because I know how
much you admired him,

11:39.597 --> 11:41.782
how much his endorsement meant
to you during the campaign,

11:41.816 --> 11:43.166
how kind he was to you,

11:43.201 --> 11:45.369
even when the liberals
wanted your head on a platter.

11:45.403 --> 11:46.987
I thought you'd want to know
that a great man died today.

11:47.021 --> 11:48.839
I thought maybe you'd want
to pray for his family,

11:49.673 --> 11:51.624
but you're running a country.

11:51.658 --> 11:53.609
I'll let you get back to it.

11:55.813 --> 11:57.197
(Door opens)

11:58.531 --> 12:00.683
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

12:03.803 --> 12:05.237
Quinn?

12:20.553 --> 12:23.372
(Keys jangle)

12:31.447 --> 12:33.565
(Camera shutter clicks)

12:33.599 --> 12:37.886
(Indistinct conversations)

12:43.375 --> 12:44.726
Lindsay.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.210
Dad.

12:48.164 --> 12:50.915
(Crying)

12:50.950 --> 12:52.101
(Camera shutter clicks)

12:52.102 --> 12:53.734
You know, we had Christmas
together every year,

12:53.735 --> 12:55.687
with presents and a tree.

12:55.721 --> 12:57.505
Every year, on December 28th,

12:57.540 --> 13:00.258
when Nancy went to the
cape to see her sister,

13:00.292 --> 13:02.093
it was Christmas,

13:02.128 --> 13:03.478
to us anyway.

13:03.512 --> 13:05.130
I have a nondisclosure agreement.

13:05.164 --> 13:06.548
I need you to sign it.

13:06.582 --> 13:09.467
So what do you need from
me to make that happen?

13:09.485 --> 13:11.035
$6 million.

13:11.070 --> 13:14.272
She has it.

13:15.206 --> 13:17.124
She does have it,

13:17.158 --> 13:19.493
but despite 15 years
of not-quite Christmas,

13:19.527 --> 13:21.827
you're still just a mistress

13:21.862 --> 13:23.113
with a pair of divorces
under her belt.

13:24.147 --> 13:25.364
You have circumstantial
evidence of an affair.

13:25.415 --> 13:27.049
That's worth a few hundred
thousand dollars.

13:27.084 --> 13:30.386
You have nowhere near $6
million worth of leverage.

13:31.605 --> 13:33.022
Vincent?

13:33.056 --> 13:34.757
(Footsteps approach)

13:34.775 --> 13:36.809
Mommy, I can't find
my magic cards.

13:36.860 --> 13:39.261
Hey, baby, come on over here.

13:41.264 --> 13:45.484
He is the spitting
image of his father.

13:45.536 --> 13:47.453
Isn't he?

13:47.487 --> 13:49.772
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

13:54.477 --> 13:56.577
(Camera shutter clicks)

13:56.578 --> 13:57.644
(Glass shatters)

13:57.679 --> 13:58.962
Damn it.

13:58.997 --> 14:00.364
She wants money?

14:01.666 --> 14:05.085
(Scoffs) Of course
she wants his money.

14:05.103 --> 14:07.154
Here's the alternative...

14:07.188 --> 14:08.989
She writes the book,
does the talk shows,

14:09.023 --> 14:10.807
and your family's at the
center of a tabloid tornado,

14:10.859 --> 14:13.227
and your husband's legacy...
all that great work...

14:13.261 --> 14:15.512
will be tarnished, and his
opponents will be justified.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.748
You're gonna have to pay
one way or another,

14:17.799 --> 14:19.566
so it's time to negotiate.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.605
$6 million.

14:25.639 --> 14:26.856
I can't start there.
Maybe if we came down to...

14:26.890 --> 14:28.941
Up front, in my name.

14:28.976 --> 14:30.059
Unacceptable.

14:30.110 --> 14:31.994
She's a lawyer.
She's smart.

14:32.029 --> 14:33.396
She knows that the book deal
alone could be worth that.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.064
Let's say we pay.

14:35.115 --> 14:37.099
What is to stop her
from asking for more?

14:37.134 --> 14:38.550
What's gonna stop her
from... from leaking it?

14:38.569 --> 14:39.885
Part of any settlement is

14:39.903 --> 14:41.170
gonna be an airtight
nondisclosure agreement.

14:41.204 --> 14:43.689
What you're asking for...
a lump sum up front...

14:43.707 --> 14:44.874
Gives the other side no
assurance, no leverage,

14:44.925 --> 14:47.143
- and it's not going to happen.
- Now hold on...

14:47.177 --> 14:48.711
We also have no idea who else
knows about your relationship.

14:48.745 --> 14:50.479
If any of this comes out,
any credible leak at any time,

14:50.514 --> 14:52.098
the deal is off.
Agreed?

14:52.132 --> 14:53.816
(The O'Jays' "for the love
of money" playing)

14:53.850 --> 14:56.936
- Good.
- Now $1 million up front,

14:56.970 --> 14:58.154
$3 million in a trust

14:58.188 --> 15:00.323

an idiot? You have got to be...

has been very generous,

but not everything
this administration does

I will still be there.

17:18.156 --> 17:20.040
You okay, Huck?

17:20.058 --> 17:21.442
You sure?
Because when we were

17:21.476 --> 17:23.242
figuring out what to do
with the pastor, you thought...

17:23.261 --> 17:24.478
- You wanted me to cut him up.
- Right.

17:24.512 --> 17:25.945
Misunderstanding.
I'm fine.

17:25.981 --> 17:27.231
(Harrison) We have a problem.

17:27.265 --> 17:29.283
The morgue's releasing
pastor Drake's body.

17:29.301 --> 17:30.801
The medical examiner
wants to do an autopsy.

17:30.836 --> 17:32.837
The family can say no to that.
Not if the M.E. thinks

17:32.871 --> 17:34.522
the person died under
suspicious circumstances.

17:34.556 --> 17:36.674
Liv, if they find out
he didn't die at home...

17:36.708 --> 17:38.359
That we tampered with a crime scene.
The story blows up.

17:38.393 --> 17:40.094
We go to jail.
The man's a joke.

17:40.128 --> 17:41.462
Every anti-gay, anti-woman,
anti-minority group

17:41.496 --> 17:43.764
in this country has a
full round of fresh ammo.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.416
Not to mention jail.

17:47.768 --> 17:50.003
That's great.
Thank you.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.673
So tell me about Janice.
You said she's a nurse?

17:53.707 --> 17:54.957
Yeah. Over at county.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.742
That's great.
And you're living together?

17:56.776 --> 17:59.111
Yeah, I-I moved into
her place last year.

18:02.099 --> 18:04.200
Dad, if there's anything
you want to ask me,

18:04.234 --> 18:05.784
any questions you have...

18:05.802 --> 18:08.320
Can you please tell me you don't
think I did those things?

18:08.355 --> 18:10.139
Lindsay...

18:10.173 --> 18:11.724
Oh, my God.
It doesn't matter.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.292
How can you say that?

18:13.326 --> 18:14.794
Because it doesn't.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.912
If it was two years ago, and I
was still sitting on the couch,

18:16.947 --> 18:18.464
watching the news, waiting
for the phone to ring,

18:18.498 --> 18:20.366
waiting for my daughter to explain

18:20.400 --> 18:21.734
why in the hell
a building blew up

18:21.768 --> 18:23.302
and why has she been
named a suspect...

18:23.336 --> 18:25.020
Maybe then, a phone call
would've been nice.

18:25.055 --> 18:27.239
I couldn't call you, dad.
I couldn't call anyone.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.591
And now...

18:28.625 --> 18:31.127
You know, now after
I finally got some peace

18:31.178 --> 18:33.245
back in my life...

18:33.280 --> 18:35.114
You're mad.

18:35.132 --> 18:37.983
I'm tired. Tired.
(Pen clicks)

18:38.018 --> 18:39.051
(Mutters)

18:39.086 --> 18:41.987
I got a furnace to fix
in Rohnert park, but...

18:44.658 --> 18:47.243
Janice is fixing up a bed for you.
(Pen clicks)

18:47.294 --> 18:51.363
And she's been
a big sport about this.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.216
Try to make her
feel appreciated.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.092
(Door opens)

19:05.744 --> 19:07.111
(Door closes) Can I help you?

19:18.489 --> 19:20.757
Can I help you, or do you
two just like to watch?

19:20.791 --> 19:22.408
Abby Wheeler
and Harrison Wright.

19:22.442 --> 19:23.509
We're with Olivia Pope
and Associates,

19:23.544 --> 19:25.311
handling pastor
Drake's arrangements.

19:25.346 --> 19:26.663
You know, we're backlogged,
but you can leave a number,

19:26.697 --> 19:28.364
and I'll call you as soon
as we get to him.

19:28.399 --> 19:29.582
Yes, well, the thing is,

19:29.616 --> 19:30.900
the family wants
an open casket...

19:30.934 --> 19:32.468
And unless the pastor is
going topless in his coffin,

19:32.503 --> 19:34.053
the incision will be well-hidden.

19:34.087 --> 19:36.005
I don't mean to brag, but
I'm something of an artist.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.307
I'm sure you are.
Ma'am, listen, is there any way

19:38.359 --> 19:40.626
that I can convince you
that cutting pastor Drake open

19:40.661 --> 19:41.894
is unnecessary?
He was a man of God.

19:41.929 --> 19:43.513
And I'm a woman
of the government.

19:43.547 --> 19:45.765
The autopsy order came from
the U.S. attorney's office.,

19:45.799 --> 19:49.651
so he gets the deluxe package.
My hands are tied.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.040
Unh-unh.

19:55.058 --> 19:56.525
There's no justification
for autopsy.

19:56.559 --> 19:58.427
The good pastor
died in his bed.

19:58.478 --> 19:59.695
Which I found wonderfully
odd, considering that

19:59.746 --> 20:01.346
the night before, you
told me he was missing.

20:01.381 --> 20:04.049
I promise,
this wasn't foul play.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.984
Pinkie swear and hope to die?

20:07.002 --> 20:09.453
Because I know you have no
proof or actual evidence

20:09.471 --> 20:11.572
you're willing to share with
me to back up said promise.

20:11.606 --> 20:13.641
You just expect me to bend
the law for you once again

20:13.675 --> 20:16.327
out of blind faith
and admiration.

20:16.361 --> 20:18.012
You pour a good bourbon, Olivia,

20:18.046 --> 20:19.179
but like I've recently discovered,

20:19.214 --> 20:21.482
so does the dive bar
down the street.

20:21.516 --> 20:24.235
I'm telling you

20:24.269 --> 20:25.953
to let this one go.

20:26.004 --> 20:28.222
It'll only make things
worse for you.

20:28.256 --> 20:29.973
Who the hell
do you think you are?

20:29.991 --> 20:31.525
A friend.

20:34.377 --> 20:35.378
(Fitz)
What's the order of targets

20:35.412 --> 20:37.013
for the first round
of ground strike?

20:37.047 --> 20:38.264
Their defense is
on the northern border,

20:38.315 --> 20:40.416
accompanied by attacks
on southern command,

20:40.450 --> 20:42.318
followed by special forces to
help target additional assets.

20:42.353 --> 20:44.637
- How many? - Oh, just enough to
secure the military compounds.

20:44.671 --> 20:46.973
Just enough? You remember
"black hawk down," right?

20:47.007 --> 20:48.674
Mr. President, I graduated
from the naval academy,

20:48.709 --> 20:51.744
- taught at the naval war...
- And yet you're missing my point.

20:51.779 --> 20:53.546
No special forces
until I order them,

20:53.580 --> 20:55.615
- and when I do, I want more
than enough... - Mr. President?

20:55.649 --> 20:58.184
I need a moment.

20:58.218 --> 21:00.253
It's important, sir.

21:02.389 --> 21:04.357
Everyone,
can we have the room, please?

21:04.391 --> 21:06.259
(Murmuring)

21:06.293 --> 21:07.660
(Cyrus clears throat)

21:09.997 --> 21:11.330
(Door closes)

21:12.265 --> 21:13.832
What?
You don't like my battle plan?

21:13.866 --> 21:15.400
12 hours from now
not soon enough

21:15.435 --> 21:17.135
to juice my approval ratings?

21:17.170 --> 21:18.870
The photo. Mass graves?

21:18.905 --> 21:20.539
Don't you find it
a little convenient,

21:20.573 --> 21:22.808
popping up just when you're
sitting on the fence?

21:22.842 --> 21:25.077
Maybe...

21:25.111 --> 21:27.746
But then I'd have to wonder
who made it convenient, Cyrus,

21:27.780 --> 21:30.716
and I don't think either
one of us wants that.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.318
I don't trust the intel.

21:33.353 --> 21:35.721
Approval ratings be damned.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.825
What do you suggest we do?

21:45.698 --> 21:48.199
- Perimeter secured.
- (Mouth full) Can I help you?

21:48.233 --> 21:51.302
Let the kid eat.

21:51.337 --> 21:52.503
Holy crap.

21:52.538 --> 21:54.606
Hey, Matt.
This a good time?

22:04.282 --> 22:06.016
This is where it happened.

22:06.551 --> 22:08.385
- What are you...
- This is where they took you.

22:08.419 --> 22:09.786
Are you kidding me?

22:09.821 --> 22:11.521
You followed me here?
She had you follow me

22:11.556 --> 22:13.523
- across the country?
- She's worried about you.

22:13.558 --> 22:15.592
That's the thing.
She doesn't need to.

22:15.627 --> 22:17.511
I just wanted a minute, okay?

22:17.545 --> 22:19.546
One minute without
all the freaking...

22:19.580 --> 22:20.931
To be a normal...

22:26.888 --> 22:29.389
I came to see my dad.

22:29.424 --> 22:32.626
I thought he would want to.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.845
My mom died when I was 7,

22:34.896 --> 22:37.898
and my dad and I were always...

22:38.832 --> 22:40.366
It was just us.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.718
He was always so proud of me.

22:42.769 --> 22:44.254
(Sniffles)

22:44.305 --> 22:47.140
But he looked at me like I was

22:47.174 --> 22:49.576
somebody else.

22:49.610 --> 22:51.728
This is where they took you.

22:52.462 --> 22:53.595
Yeah.

22:53.730 --> 22:55.147
No, I mean, this is

22:55.181 --> 22:56.882
where they took <i>you,</i>
Lindsay Dwyer,

22:56.916 --> 22:58.851
they did something to you.

22:58.885 --> 23:01.420
When they do something
like that, you don't go back.

23:01.454 --> 23:03.989
You can't.

23:04.023 --> 23:07.059
They said seven people died
in that explosion, right?

23:07.093 --> 23:08.410
- Yeah.
- They were wrong.

23:08.461 --> 23:10.263
It was eight.

23:12.899 --> 23:15.037
Let's go home.

23:20.172 --> 23:21.505
Let's talk about the picture.

23:21.523 --> 23:22.807
What's wrong with it?

23:22.841 --> 23:24.008
You should talk to my boss.

23:24.043 --> 23:26.411
I am your boss.

23:26.445 --> 23:27.845
It's the millet, sir.

23:27.879 --> 23:28.813
The millet?

23:28.847 --> 23:30.298
The crops in the picture?

23:30.332 --> 23:32.433
Millet's native to east Sudan,
and if this were ten,

23:32.484 --> 23:35.202
even five years ago,
I'd say yes, absolutely,

23:35.436 --> 23:37.270
this is east Sudan, and this
could've happened yesterday.

23:37.321 --> 23:39.372
And the difference between
now and five years ago?

23:39.423 --> 23:42.392
Global warming shortening
the growing seasons.

23:42.410 --> 23:43.610
And millet...
there hasn't been millet

23:43.644 --> 23:45.011
in that part of the
continent since July,

23:45.046 --> 23:47.614
- August, at the latest.
- Well before the conflict started.

23:49.317 --> 23:52.435
And you shared these
concerns with the director?

23:52.470 --> 23:53.853
What the hell's going on?

23:53.888 --> 23:56.306
Nice place you got here, Amos.

23:56.324 --> 23:57.640
Get out of my way, Cy.

23:57.658 --> 23:59.292
Actually, I need you
to stay out here with me.

23:59.343 --> 24:00.427
It's a clearance thing.

24:00.478 --> 24:01.711
I'm the director of the CIA.

24:01.729 --> 24:02.862
Not anymore you're not.

24:02.914 --> 24:04.581
I won't be photoshopped
into a war.

24:04.615 --> 24:07.133
I want a resignation letter
on my desk in the morning.

24:07.168 --> 24:09.419
You've been wanting to spend
more time with your family.

24:09.453 --> 24:10.770
People still buy that one,
right?

24:10.805 --> 24:12.722
Yeah, well,
I plan on using it someday.

24:12.756 --> 24:15.809
It's just
one kid's interpretation.

24:16.243 --> 24:18.010
<i>He loved to quote</i>
<i>Mahatma Gandhi,</i>

24:18.044 --> 24:19.545
<i>saying, "we need to make</i>
<i>our opponents"...</i>

24:19.579 --> 24:21.113
(Telephone rings) <i>"See the injustice</i>
<i>of their ways."</i>

24:21.148 --> 24:22.815
<i>Pastor Drake lived</i>
<i>what he preached,</i>

24:22.849 --> 24:25.468
<i>leading the famous voting</i>
<i>rights march on Tallahassee.</i> (Ring)

24:25.502 --> 24:28.537
<i>At the age of 22, he...</i>
(Turns off tv)

24:28.572 --> 24:30.706
23 people.

24:30.740 --> 24:33.759
I sent half of them home early,
so it's, like, 12 people.

24:33.793 --> 24:35.511
Besides, I'm working.

24:35.545 --> 24:37.146
I'm working on my eulogy
for pastor Drake,

24:37.180 --> 24:39.048
who I did not know
you were handling.

24:39.082 --> 24:42.384
I'm handling pastor Drake.

24:42.419 --> 24:44.170
Very sad.

24:44.204 --> 24:45.771
What?

24:45.772 --> 24:47.740
I shouldn't.

24:48.674 --> 24:49.724
What? Tell me.

24:49.725 --> 24:52.911
You cannot repeat
this to anyone.

24:53.062 --> 24:54.062
I mean it.

24:54.596 --> 24:55.780
Are you in?

24:55.781 --> 24:57.582
I'm in. Tell me.

24:57.816 --> 24:59.351
He was...

24:59.985 --> 25:01.252
Kinda kinky.

25:00.686 --> 25:01.853
Who?

25:02.488 --> 25:03.771
Pastor Drake.

25:03.906 --> 25:05.740
He died on top of a woman

25:05.774 --> 25:08.442
who was handcuffed
to a bed in a hotel.

25:08.477 --> 25:09.877
Are you serious?

25:09.912 --> 25:11.679
She couldn't call for help
because the sounds

25:11.697 --> 25:14.432
of her screams were
muffled by his...girth.

25:14.466 --> 25:15.849
Pastor Drake?

25:15.867 --> 25:17.101
The nation's pastor.

25:17.135 --> 25:20.488
(Laughs)

25:20.522 --> 25:22.707
(Laughs)

25:22.758 --> 25:24.208
(Both laughing)

25:24.259 --> 25:25.793
Stop laughing!

25:25.811 --> 25:26.994
(Laughs) I'm sorry.

25:27.029 --> 25:28.228
This is wrong.
He was a leader,

25:28.246 --> 25:29.697
a civil rights icon.

25:29.715 --> 25:30.715
(Fitz continues laughing)

25:30.749 --> 25:33.701
(Laughs)

25:33.735 --> 25:36.754
It's like hearing about
your father's sex life.

25:36.788 --> 25:38.255
That image...

25:38.290 --> 25:40.825
is burned on my brain.
(Laughs)

25:40.859 --> 25:44.845
(Laughing)

25:44.880 --> 25:48.232
(Continues laughing)

25:51.435 --> 25:52.935
She was his mistress.

25:54.088 --> 25:56.773
The woman in the handcuffs.

25:56.808 --> 25:57.908
(Sighs)

25:57.942 --> 26:00.711
He loved her.

26:00.745 --> 26:03.496
What do you want me to do, Liv?

26:05.799 --> 26:07.884
Tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

26:07.918 --> 26:10.136
(Sighs)

26:13.991 --> 26:15.407
Let me go.

26:15.425 --> 26:18.511
Anything but that.

26:18.545 --> 26:19.529
Okay.

26:19.563 --> 26:20.696
I should go.

26:20.731 --> 26:21.664
Liv.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.466
- What?
- Mellie's going to see

26:23.500 --> 26:26.669
the pastor's wife tomorrow,
to pay respects.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.703
I just thought you should know.

26:28.738 --> 26:30.472
Great.
Thanks for the heads-up.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.940
You know what I need?

26:31.975 --> 26:34.825
I need you to shut down
the autopsy on pastor Drake.

26:34.843 --> 26:35.827
I need you to shut down

26:35.861 --> 26:37.012
- the U.S. attorney for me.
- Liv, I can't just...

26:37.064 --> 26:40.282
<i>That</i> is what I want!

26:43.169 --> 26:45.103
Consider it handled.

26:45.138 --> 26:46.471
Thank you.

26:46.505 --> 26:47.839
(Line disconnects)

26:52.178 --> 26:53.344
(Hangs up receiver)

27:03.100 --> 27:05.400
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

27:05.401 --> 27:08.403
Okay, so the first lady
is less than a minute out,

27:08.438 --> 27:10.088
there's gonna be one
photographer allowed in

27:10.123 --> 27:11.623
to take some pictures, just
one, and one pool reporter,

27:11.674 --> 27:12.975
big fan of your husband's.

27:13.009 --> 27:14.443
The first lady will stay
between two and five minutes,

27:14.477 --> 27:17.362
and then she'll go. Then we'll
go to the church. Nancy?

27:17.413 --> 27:18.814
Mmm?

27:19.548 --> 27:20.532
What did you take?

27:20.566 --> 27:23.101
A sedative.

27:23.135 --> 27:27.372
Can someone bring me a cup
of coffee for Mrs. Drake?

27:27.423 --> 27:29.541
Nancy, listen to me.

27:29.575 --> 27:32.393
Nancy, she says how sorry
she is for your loss,

27:32.427 --> 27:33.611
and you say "thank you."
She says she hopes

27:33.662 --> 27:36.246
you'll get through this,
and you say "thank you."

27:36.281 --> 27:38.198
She says she and the President
are praying for you,

27:38.199 --> 27:39.600
and you say "thank you."

27:39.634 --> 27:41.101
That's all you have to do...
Say "thank you."

27:41.136 --> 27:43.804
No matter what she says,
you say "thank you."

27:43.838 --> 27:46.423
What do you say, Nancy?

27:46.458 --> 27:48.609
What do you say?

27:48.643 --> 27:50.344
Nancy.

27:50.412 --> 27:51.495
Thank you.

27:52.429 --> 27:53.846
Good.

27:53.864 --> 27:55.031
Drink the coffee.

27:58.182 --> 28:01.234
(Camera shutter clicking)

28:07.829 --> 28:09.629
(Whispers) Excuse me.

28:13.801 --> 28:15.435
Mrs. Drake,

28:15.469 --> 28:18.237
your husband was a great
man and a great leader.

28:18.272 --> 28:21.190
I am so, so sorry
for your loss.

28:21.224 --> 28:22.625
(Camera shutter
continues clicking)

28:22.660 --> 28:25.211
(Mouths words)

28:27.464 --> 28:29.248
Nancy,

28:29.283 --> 28:30.867
I'm so sorry for your loss.

28:31.801 --> 28:34.820
(Whispers) He had a mistress.

28:35.654 --> 28:37.705
I'm sorry.
I don't think I heard that.

28:37.740 --> 28:38.706
What did she say?

28:38.741 --> 28:40.074
Can we clear the room?

28:40.109 --> 28:42.126
I think Mrs.Drake and I
would like to have

28:42.160 --> 28:44.228
a private moment
to pray together.

28:44.246 --> 28:46.064
Everyone, if you don't mind.

28:47.632 --> 28:50.318
(Murmuring)

28:54.440 --> 28:55.873
We'll be fine.

29:01.764 --> 29:02.880
(Door closes)

29:05.384 --> 29:07.435
Thank you.

29:07.486 --> 29:10.054
I'm supposed to say
"thank you."

29:10.089 --> 29:12.790
But he was a cheating bastard.

29:12.825 --> 29:14.692
How did I not know?

29:14.727 --> 29:16.527
Such an idiot.

29:16.561 --> 29:19.897
(Chuckles) There's no way
you could possibly

29:19.932 --> 29:22.383
know what it's like to have...

29:24.018 --> 29:25.952
It's like... it's like...
It's like...

29:25.986 --> 29:27.837
It's like you didn't
know him at all.

29:27.871 --> 29:29.188
Yes.

29:31.792 --> 29:35.411
You thought the two
of you were partners.

29:35.446 --> 29:37.480
You thought the problems in
your marriage were solvable.

29:37.514 --> 29:41.934
You thought "for better or
worse" meant something.

29:41.969 --> 29:44.187
You thought no matter
what, he'd be faithful.

29:44.221 --> 29:47.089
(Crying)

29:47.107 --> 29:49.042
Nancy, right now you are angry.

29:49.076 --> 29:51.527
Right now you feel betrayed,
but here's the thing...

29:51.545 --> 29:54.030
You <i>are</i> his partner.

29:54.064 --> 29:56.382
You are his wife.

29:56.417 --> 29:57.450
(Crying)

29:57.584 --> 30:01.020
Some mistress
doesn't change that.

30:02.154 --> 30:04.789
He made a mistake.
You have to forgive him for it.

30:04.824 --> 30:06.708
You weren't wrong about him.

30:06.742 --> 30:08.910
You were just stronger
than he was.

30:08.911 --> 30:11.346
And he is not a monster.

30:11.381 --> 30:12.464
(Continues crying)

30:13.199 --> 30:14.899
He's the man
you fell in love with.

30:15.602 --> 30:17.770
You have to bury the
man that you married.

30:17.804 --> 30:19.371
(Sobbing)

30:19.422 --> 30:20.589
No.

30:20.623 --> 30:21.957
Somewhere in
all the cheating, Nancy,

30:21.975 --> 30:27.596
is the man that you married, and
<i>you</i> are his <i>wife.</i>

30:27.630 --> 30:32.484
Right to the end, be his wife.

30:32.519 --> 30:35.387
(Continues sobbing)

30:53.321 --> 30:54.621
(Projector and
camera shutter click)

30:54.656 --> 30:57.191
(Elevator bell dings)

30:57.225 --> 30:59.043
Stupid, moneygrubbing,
mistress whore!

30:59.077 --> 31:00.711
- What?
- She's not signing.

31:00.745 --> 31:01.896
She says she wants more money.

31:01.930 --> 31:03.664
Apparently, $6 million
isn't enough for her.

31:03.698 --> 31:05.799
- Did she say how much?
- No, just that if she doesn't get it,

31:05.833 --> 31:07.634
she's gonna blab to the press
before the funeral.

31:07.668 --> 31:08.468
Which is in three hours,
so at this point,

31:08.486 --> 31:10.637
she knows we'll give her
anything to shut her up.

31:10.671 --> 31:12.606
Between this and the autopsy,
pastor Drake's gonna be

31:12.640 --> 31:14.774
- a punch line by the end of the day.
- I took care of the autopsy.

31:14.809 --> 31:15.775
- What?
- It's handled.

31:15.809 --> 31:17.210
How? How is it handled?

31:17.244 --> 31:18.862
It's <i>handled.</i>

31:18.896 --> 31:20.697
- Where'd it come from?
- David.

31:20.731 --> 31:23.383
How high does it go? Your boss?
Your boss' boss?

31:23.417 --> 31:25.652
- Take a seat. David...
- The government says no autopsy

31:25.686 --> 31:27.120
when the evidence
says otherwise.

31:27.138 --> 31:28.772
That kind of decision's
gotta come from way up top.

31:28.806 --> 31:30.557
Your boss' boss' boss.

31:30.591 --> 31:31.925
I don't even know who that is.

31:31.943 --> 31:33.660
You get that high,
it's probably not even a person.

31:33.694 --> 31:35.695
It's a supersecret brain being
kept alive in a bowl of jelly.

31:35.729 --> 31:36.796
David.

31:37.631 --> 31:39.598
I just want to know how
she did it.

31:39.633 --> 31:41.233
Olivia... how did
she swing this one?

31:41.268 --> 31:43.419
- Nobody swung anything.
- Of course she did.

31:43.453 --> 31:46.088
Anyway, I'm not gonna argue
with you. It's done. No autopsy.

31:46.139 --> 31:48.691
I just want to know
how she did it.

31:48.725 --> 31:50.659
You lost a big trial.

31:50.694 --> 31:52.911
First, what does that have to do
with our autopsy,

31:52.929 --> 31:55.164
- and second, the trial was lost.
I didn't lose it. - David.

31:55.198 --> 31:57.550
- David. - Would you have argued that
case any differently than I did?

31:57.584 --> 31:59.985
- Would you have?
- You need to take a vacation.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.638
Get away for a few days.
Take some time for yourself.

32:02.672 --> 32:04.640
I don't need "me" time, Pat.
I need you to help...

32:05.274 --> 32:06.875
It's not a suggestion.

32:08.728 --> 32:11.947
The department has decided you
need to take a leave of absence,

32:11.981 --> 32:13.865
and that decision comes
from my boss' boss,

32:13.899 --> 32:16.400
my boss, and me.

32:20.623 --> 32:22.573
You said $6 million,
Nancy agreed,

32:22.591 --> 32:23.908
- and now you have to sign.
- It's not enough.

32:23.926 --> 32:25.510
- How much is enough?
- I don't know.

32:25.528 --> 32:26.811
- I need a number, Anna.
- I don't know.

32:26.846 --> 32:27.829
$10 million? $20 million?

32:27.880 --> 32:29.531
- I don't know!
- I know.

32:31.033 --> 32:36.520
What you want is 15 Christmases
on December 25th,

32:36.554 --> 32:38.088
15 birthdays,

32:38.122 --> 32:41.224
15 years of sleeping next to him
and waking up with him.

32:41.258 --> 32:43.543
You want Anniversary dinners
and parent-teacher conferences

32:43.578 --> 32:44.695
and school plays.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.114
You want fights over whose
turn it is to wash the dishes

32:47.165 --> 32:48.632
and walk the dog.

32:48.666 --> 32:50.217
What you want, what
you've always wanted,

32:50.251 --> 32:52.336
is to be part of his life.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.821
And now he's gone, and you
want to be part of his legacy,

32:54.856 --> 32:57.157
but you aren't,
and you never were,

32:57.191 --> 32:58.809
and I can get you $6 million

32:58.843 --> 33:00.360
to try to fix
how much that hurts...

33:00.411 --> 33:03.463
(Voice breaks) But <i>that</i>
is all that I can do.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.685
I just thought
we'd have more time,

33:08.720 --> 33:11.571
that Vincent would really
get to know him...

33:11.606 --> 33:15.008
(Voice breaking)
And when the time came,

33:15.043 --> 33:18.511
we'd have our chance
to say good-bye.

33:20.031 --> 33:22.332
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

33:24.301 --> 33:27.637
(Indistinct conversations)

33:34.144 --> 33:35.344
Nancy.

33:41.401 --> 33:44.153
She hasn't signed.
There's no deal.

33:45.087 --> 33:46.871
You tell me this
ten minutes before

33:46.906 --> 33:49.874
I'm supposed to say good-bye
to my husband for the last time,

33:49.925 --> 33:51.876
before my children say
good-bye to their father?

33:51.927 --> 33:53.928
It's also ten minutes
before this funeral

33:53.963 --> 33:55.680
is carried live
on three networks.

33:55.765 --> 33:57.515
Anna could make it
so your husband's legacy

33:57.550 --> 33:59.500
is the one thing people
<i>aren't</i> talking about.

33:59.518 --> 34:00.085
What does she want?

34:00.086 --> 34:01.704
To be here, at the
funeral, with her son.

34:01.738 --> 34:04.206
- That's out of the question.
- Nancy, she's in a car outside.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.559
This would be it... the last thing
you would ever have to do.

34:07.610 --> 34:10.130
That woman is not setting foot
in this church.

34:11.081 --> 34:12.313
In that case,

34:12.331 --> 34:13.949
all she has to do is walk up
to a television camera,

34:13.983 --> 34:15.650
and everything we've done
in the last few days,

34:15.668 --> 34:18.003
everything your husband's done
in the last <i>50 years</i>

34:18.038 --> 34:19.688
is for nothing.

34:26.254 --> 34:27.254

<i>If you are just joining us,</i>

I'm so sorry, Nancy.

He was a remarkable man.

34:55.998 --> 34:58.217
Thank you, Mr. President.

35:00.053 --> 35:03.339
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

35:03.390 --> 35:04.991
He was a great man.

35:05.025 --> 35:05.941
(Man) Thank you, sir.

35:05.993 --> 35:07.326
Yeah.
Hi, sweetheart.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.261
I'm so sorry.

35:09.296 --> 35:13.449
♪

35:23.475 --> 35:26.677
(Amplified voice) Marvin Drake
gave spiritual counsel

35:26.711 --> 35:27.946
to seven presidents.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.714
In times of crisis,
he was a tireless reminder

35:30.749 --> 35:33.851
to all Americans,
to every citizen of the world,

35:33.885 --> 35:36.922
to heed those better
angels of our nature.

35:38.156 --> 35:41.242
With his departure, it's
incumbent upon the rest of us,

35:41.276 --> 35:42.559
<i>most especially those of us</i>
<i>in public office...</i>

35:42.577 --> 35:43.827
Damn.

35:43.862 --> 35:45.296
We give great funeral.

<i>...Temper our divides.</i>

35:47.565 --> 35:49.299

<i>But while the world and nation</i>
<i>mourn his passing,</i>

35:52.119 --> 35:54.054
<i>there is, of course...</i>

35:54.105 --> 35:56.239
A more personal anguish.

35:56.257 --> 35:59.843
That's suffered by his family

35:59.877 --> 36:02.345
and by his friends.

36:02.380 --> 36:05.515
We knew
his greatest contribution

36:05.549 --> 36:09.102
wasn't simply
in his inspiring words,

36:09.136 --> 36:10.253
but in his deeds,

36:10.287 --> 36:13.974
that hope was attended
by generosity...

36:16.193 --> 36:19.362
Tolerance by forgiveness...

36:21.198 --> 36:24.701
Understanding by acceptance.

36:33.811 --> 36:37.464
(Camera shutter clicking)

36:39.298 --> 36:40.782
Do you remember when
we first got married,

36:40.816 --> 36:43.351
that little apartment we
had on Oregon street?

36:43.385 --> 36:45.603
The one at was always freezing?

36:45.654 --> 36:47.222
I would get in bed the
minute we got home.

36:47.256 --> 36:49.307
We had that electric blanket.

36:49.341 --> 36:52.010
It was warmer in bed together
than anywhere else in the house.

36:52.044 --> 36:53.478
What do you want, Mellie?

36:56.432 --> 36:58.065
I'd like you to forgive me.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.887
I've forgiven you.

37:05.024 --> 37:06.508
We can't do this.

37:08.427 --> 37:12.547
Live in a perpetual war zone.

37:12.581 --> 37:15.466
We were never...

37:16.101 --> 37:18.953
But we were <i>always</i> partners...

37:20.005 --> 37:23.541
And we were always friends.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.811
I know you hate me.

37:28.313 --> 37:31.264
I know you don't even want to be
in the same room with me, but

37:31.298 --> 37:33.533
somewhere in here...

37:34.951 --> 37:36.819
Is a girl you got
under the blanket with

37:36.854 --> 37:38.470
on Oregon street.

37:38.488 --> 37:39.972
(Sighs)

37:41.391 --> 37:43.075
I am still the girl
who kept you warm,

37:43.110 --> 37:45.528
and you have to forgive me.

37:47.998 --> 37:52.001
Tell me what to do,
and I will do it.

37:52.035 --> 37:53.986
But you have to forgive me.

38:03.263 --> 38:04.664
Come here.

38:11.288 --> 38:14.123
I forgive you.

38:14.157 --> 38:15.591
Okay?

38:19.062 --> 38:20.796
You're forgiven.

38:24.666 --> 38:25.666
Okay.

38:25.701 --> 38:26.934
Okay.

38:45.502 --> 38:48.806
My name is Huck,
and I'm a... an alcoholic.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.224
(All) Hi, Huck.

38:50.258 --> 38:53.527
I like to drink, uh, let's see...

38:53.561 --> 38:55.212
whiskey.

38:55.247 --> 38:58.966
I used to get paid a lot
of money to drink whiskey

38:59.000 --> 39:02.670
because I'm really,
really good at it.

39:02.721 --> 39:05.789
But now it's all I think about...

39:07.207 --> 39:09.692
The way the whiskey
makes me feel...

39:09.726 --> 39:12.128
And... I don't want to be
that person,

39:12.162 --> 39:16.415
a person who does that,
who drinks whiskey for a living,

39:16.450 --> 39:20.819
and I just hope
that by coming here

39:20.853 --> 39:22.671
and t-talking about it,

39:22.705 --> 39:25.958
I can stop... drinking...

39:25.992 --> 39:27.143
whiskey.

39:28.378 --> 39:29.962
(All) Thanks, Huck.

39:38.187 --> 39:40.188
Secure line, please.

39:40.223 --> 39:44.026
(Pressing buttons)

39:44.060 --> 39:46.361
(Sighs)

39:49.515 --> 39:52.117
(Rings) <i>(Fitz) ...Gave spiritual</i>
<i>counsel to seven presidents.</i>

39:52.151 --> 39:56.537
<i>In times of crisis,</i>
<i>he was a tireless reminder...</i>

39:56.571 --> 39:57.455
(Ring)

39:57.489 --> 39:59.658
<i>to all Americans,</i>
<i>to every citizen of the world,</i>

39:59.692 --> 40:03.494
<i>to heed those better angels</i>
<i>within ourselves.</i>

40:03.495 --> 40:05.029
(Ring)

40:05.163 --> 40:07.765
<i>In his departure, it's</i>
<i>incumbent upon the rest of us,</i>

40:07.799 --> 40:09.767
<i>most especially those of us...</i>
(Turns off tv)

40:09.801 --> 40:11.151
(Ring)

40:24.716 --> 40:26.933
James...

40:26.951 --> 40:28.368
I did not say one word.

40:28.403 --> 40:30.370
I can't have a baby with you

40:30.905 --> 40:32.372
because I already have a baby,

40:32.406 --> 40:34.557
and his name is President
Fitzgerald Grant.

40:34.608 --> 40:38.378
And my baby is troubled
and angry and exhausting

40:38.412 --> 40:40.680
and brilliant, and he might
actually change the world

40:40.714 --> 40:42.282
if I keep my eyes on him
every minute

40:42.316 --> 40:43.867
and make sure that he
eats his vegetables,

40:43.901 --> 40:45.368
and so I don't have the
time or the energy

40:45.402 --> 40:48.804
or extra space in my soul
for another baby, James.

40:48.839 --> 40:49.606
I'm sorry.

40:49.657 --> 40:52.592
I don't.
I can't.

40:52.626 --> 40:55.895
I don't have it in me to
take care of someone else

40:55.929 --> 41:00.417
because I'm busy taking care
of the United States of America.

41:07.124 --> 41:08.558
(Sets down glasses)

41:12.679 --> 41:13.647
For the record,

41:14.281 --> 41:16.482
this is not over.

41:16.516 --> 41:21.653
But you know I find power,
Cyrus, very sexy.

41:21.671 --> 41:23.472
You want to fool around?

41:24.407 --> 41:25.774
No.

41:27.878 --> 41:30.279
Yes.

41:31.913 --> 41:33.297
(Projector and
camera shutter click)

41:33.315 --> 41:35.249
Okay, justice Thornton,
since it's so rare to get

41:35.300 --> 41:36.934
a supreme to make
a tv appearance,

41:36.968 --> 41:37.902
they're definitely gonna go
after your decision

41:37.936 --> 41:38.953
on <i>Murray vs. Murray.</i>

41:39.004 --> 41:40.571
I voted with six of the
others on that one.

41:40.589 --> 41:42.223
Keep your answers
short and sweet.

41:42.274 --> 41:43.274
You're a supreme court justice.

41:43.308 --> 41:44.425
You don't have anything
to prove.

41:44.459 --> 41:46.510
Most important,
don't get defensive.

41:46.528 --> 41:49.096
She's the only one I let
talk to me like that.

41:49.131 --> 41:50.131
Could I bother you?
I think I may have left

41:50.182 --> 41:52.349
my cell phone
on the table out there.

41:52.367 --> 41:53.569
- I'll check.
- Thank you.

41:54.820 --> 41:56.721
Where are we?

41:56.755 --> 41:58.489
She tried to go home.
We talked her out of it.

41:58.523 --> 41:59.974
(Click) I won't lie, Liv.

42:00.008 --> 42:02.209
There's a part of me that
wishes we'd let her hang.

42:02.210 --> 42:03.543
She's innocent, Verna.

42:03.595 --> 42:05.896
She didn't ask for any of it.

42:05.930 --> 42:06.980
That innocent little girl of ours

42:07.015 --> 42:08.632
could bring down
this government.

42:12.970 --> 42:15.022
(Click)

42:15.106 --> 42:16.273
I can't find it.

42:16.307 --> 42:17.407
Would you look at that?

42:17.442 --> 42:19.443
In my purse the whole time.
(Laughs)

42:21.529 --> 42:24.598
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)
