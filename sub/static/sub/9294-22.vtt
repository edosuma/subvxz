00:12.500 --> 00:15.760
Agent Walker told me
that there's a chance--

00:15.800 --> 00:19.530
a small chance
that I could help you.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.030
JACK:
I'm dying.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.860
And whatever small chance there
is to stop that from happening

00:23.900 --> 00:25.260
it is not worth

00:25.300 --> 00:29.330
the pain for me to let you sit
there and watch me die.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.730
Daddy, I don't want to lose you.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.830
Come here.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.500
I don't.
(groans)

00:35.530 --> 00:37.030
What is it?

00:37.060 --> 00:39.400
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,

00:39.430 --> 00:41.700
but you need to go.

00:41.730 --> 00:43.360
Hodges was behind everything
that happened today,

00:43.400 --> 00:44.600
from the planes going down

00:44.630 --> 00:46.800
to the attack
on the White House.
What?

00:46.830 --> 00:49.860
He's also responsible for
the death of my brother.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.600
All you need to know
is Hodges worked a deal.

00:52.630 --> 00:53.300
Witness Protection.

00:53.330 --> 00:54.630
My mother approved it

00:54.660 --> 00:57.760
and he's going free...
unless someone intervenes.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.760
I'll get you contact
information, a price

00:59.800 --> 01:02.600
and instructions on how
to transfer the funds.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.629
<i>Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.</i>

01:04.660 --> 01:05.960
<i>I spoke to the contact,</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:07.930
<i>but I couldn't
go through with it.</i>

01:15.060 --> 01:16.660
Listen to me, Jibraan.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.160
If you don't do exactly
as I say,

01:20.200 --> 01:22.730
you're going to watch
your younger brother die
right in front of your eyes.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.660
And then...

01:25.700 --> 01:27.760
I'm gonna kill you, hmm?

01:27.800 --> 01:29.930
It was the Americans who killed
our parents, Hamid.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.530
I'm going
to make them pay.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.930
What have you done
to my brother?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.530
You've poisoned his mind.
This isn't my brother.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.330
We're looking for a man
who worships here.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.600
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.
Do you know him?

01:38.630 --> 01:42.330
I know him,
but he is not a terrorist.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.200
We did not come here
to debate this with you!

01:44.230 --> 01:45.430
Where does he live?!

01:45.460 --> 01:46.600
You come into a house of worship

01:46.630 --> 01:48.600
with information
you should not have,

01:48.630 --> 01:50.160
an outrageous accusation,

01:50.200 --> 01:52.630
no legal warrant
and threaten me.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.760
I have not threatened you.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.500
Not yet, but we both know
where this is going.

01:58.530 --> 02:00.160
Jack, it's Chloe.
I found something weird

02:00.200 --> 02:02.000
about these hits
on Jibraan Al-Zarian.

02:02.030 --> 02:03.600
You know how I said that
the $2 million

02:03.630 --> 02:06.000
was deposited into his account
over a period of six months?

02:06.030 --> 02:07.460
Well, that wasn't right.
They were backdated.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.199
What about the extremist
Web sites he was visiting?

02:09.229 --> 02:10.930
Same thing with
the time stamps.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.730
The hits were backdated
30 minutes ago.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.700
Jibraan could be innocent.

02:14.730 --> 02:16.200
What do you have, Agent?

02:16.230 --> 02:18.430
Armed hostile in the
back room holding a hostage.

02:18.460 --> 02:21.460
What about Almeida?
He's not in there.
See for yourself.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.460
Is that who
you're looking for?

02:22.500 --> 02:23.660
No.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.230
It's Jibraan's
brother Hamid.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.630
They're using him as
leverage to make Jibraan
do what they want.

02:27.660 --> 02:30.000
How can you be sure?
Because that's what
I would have done.

02:36.060 --> 02:37.460
Hamid, stop!

02:37.500 --> 02:39.260
Put it down.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.030
We're FBI. We need him alive.

02:49.030 --> 02:52.560
<i>CARA: The canister's being
retrofitted to maximize
dispersion.</i>

02:52.600 --> 02:54.500
We're on target to
release the bioweapon

02:54.530 --> 02:56.800
at Washington Central
Station within the hour.

02:56.830 --> 02:59.400
Your casualty estimates
are holding up?

02:59.430 --> 03:00.660
I think they're conservative.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.260
A significant portion of
the pathogen will escape

03:03.300 --> 03:04.700
into the station's
ventilation system,

03:04.730 --> 03:06.160
which will circulate it for us.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.360
Between 8,000 and 10,000
commuters will be exposed.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.860
Tell me about
Mr. Al-Zarian.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.730
Is he compliant?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.660
Yes. His primary
concern at this point

03:14.700 --> 03:16.660
is for the safety
of his brother.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.060
All right.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.800
What's his level of awareness
regarding the plan?

03:19.830 --> 03:20.860
He won't know anything

03:20.900 --> 03:23.160
about the canister
until it's too late.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.930
Good. We'll talk
once it's done.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.930
Trigger mechanism's working.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.260
This device will tell me

04:01.300 --> 04:04.000
where you are at all times.

04:04.030 --> 04:07.100
It will also allow us
to talk to each other.

04:07.130 --> 04:08.700
Talk about what?

04:08.730 --> 04:10.930
You still haven't told me
what you want me to do.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.160
Right now I just want you
to get on the subway

04:14.200 --> 04:17.200
and take the Red Line all
the way to Washington Center.

04:17.230 --> 04:18.959
And when I get there?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.829
I'll let you know then.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.430
I'm not stupid.

04:23.460 --> 04:26.600
I know you are going
to blame me for something.

04:26.630 --> 04:29.360
Jibraan...
What's your plan, huh?

04:29.400 --> 04:32.000
You are going to hurt people?

04:32.030 --> 04:34.900
Jibraan, the only person you
need to worry about right now

04:34.930 --> 04:37.160
is your brother.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.400
You follow my instructions,

04:39.430 --> 04:40.560
and Hamid lives.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.860
You do something stupid,
and he dies...

04:43.900 --> 04:46.000
badly.

04:46.030 --> 04:47.360
Understood?

04:48.400 --> 04:49.760
Good.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.560
Red Line, westbound,

04:52.600 --> 04:55.360
to Washington Center,
got it?

04:57.330 --> 04:59.000
Let's go. Come on.

06:19.130 --> 06:22.360
Sorry this had
to happen like this.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.900
We will find your brother.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.900
You should talk to him.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.760
Kid doesn't know anything,

06:39.800 --> 06:41.630
except that his brother
was taken by Tony

06:41.660 --> 06:43.260
about a half
an hour ago.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.430
He didn't overhear
anything about a target
or the time frame.

06:45.460 --> 06:48.000
Right now, he's our only lead.

06:48.030 --> 06:49.900
He's badly injured.
I don't know if he's

06:49.930 --> 06:51.730
in any condition to talk.
My God!

06:51.760 --> 06:54.860
Hold his head. I'm going
to give him some morphine.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.800
No, you're not.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.830
His wound is in the middle
of a nerve cluster.

06:58.860 --> 07:01.730
He can go into shock
from the pain.
I know.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.430
Back off.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.000
(groans)

07:12.260 --> 07:14.400
I want you to step out
of the room.

07:14.430 --> 07:17.660
Do what you need to do.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.700
Where's Almeida?

07:20.730 --> 07:22.430
Please, just give me
the morphine.

07:22.460 --> 07:23.630
I'll give you the morphine

07:23.660 --> 07:26.260
as soon as you talk.
Where's Tony Almeida?

07:26.300 --> 07:27.560
What's the target?

07:27.600 --> 07:29.930
I don't know... (screaming)

07:31.530 --> 07:34.400
What's the target?!
I don't know!

07:34.430 --> 07:35.700
I'm telling you the truth!

07:35.730 --> 07:38.160
My job was just to watch the kid
and monitor things here.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.260
Almeida didn't tell me

07:39.300 --> 07:40.860
where he was going
or where the target is.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.000
How do you contact him?

07:43.030 --> 07:45.330
I can't. (screaming)

07:46.300 --> 07:47.900
Okay, okay.

07:47.930 --> 07:50.130
I have a number.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.360
But I'm not supposed to use it
unless there's a problem.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.560
You better start thinking
of one fast.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.600
Where is his phone?

07:55.630 --> 07:57.330
I have it here.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.930
Give him enough morphine
so that he can take the
pain out of his voice.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.300
Nothing more.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.960
I want you to get Chloe to run
a trace on this number.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.130
Tell her to feed it back
to our cell phones.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.130
You better start thinking
about what you're going to say.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.000
You try and screw
with me on this, it'll

08:18.030 --> 08:20.360
be the last thing you ever do.
You understand me?

08:22.030 --> 08:24.100
Do you understand me?

08:24.130 --> 08:25.760
Yes.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.660
(phone ringing)
Janis Gold.

08:27.700 --> 08:28.830
It's Renee.

08:28.860 --> 08:31.200
I need Chloe to run
a peer-to-peer cellular trace

08:31.230 --> 08:33.260
from a GSM I.D.
I can do that.

08:33.299 --> 08:35.230
Jack asked for Chloe
to run point on this.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.929
CHLOE:
What's the number?

08:36.960 --> 08:38.559
Alpha-Charlie-3316.
Got it.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.760
I'll need you to run it back
through to me and Jack.
Hold on.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.230
She's working on it.
Good.

08:44.260 --> 08:46.130
I'll open up
the locate protocol.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.160
You establish

08:47.200 --> 08:48.300
a secure VPN.

08:48.330 --> 08:51.960
All right, opening
a channel on the Inter-Sat...

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Why would you do that?

08:53.030 --> 08:54.660
What?

08:54.700 --> 08:57.460
You know connecting
through a DMA node
would be a lot faster.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.530
No, I don't know it's quicker
to use a DMA node

08:59.560 --> 09:01.130
or else I would have done
just that.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.700
I had no idea the DMA nodes
were up and running.

09:02.730 --> 09:06.130
Really? Because they've
been up and running for
about two years.

09:06.160 --> 09:09.100
It's obvious I'll never be
able to do things

09:09.130 --> 09:10.660
as well as you did at CTU.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.460
All I ask is that you not make
me feel like an idiot

09:13.500 --> 09:15.400
while you're pointing that out.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.060
All right.

09:19.300 --> 09:22.160
Agent Walker, the trace
is up and running

09:22.200 --> 09:23.300
whenever you're ready.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.600
Jack.
Chloe, I'm on.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.400
You ready?

09:30.430 --> 09:32.660
What's the number?

09:32.700 --> 09:36.560
202... 555...

09:36.600 --> 09:38.800
0147.

09:41.700 --> 09:42.830
(phone ringing)

09:42.860 --> 09:44.260
It's ringing.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.630
Why are you calling me?

09:46.660 --> 09:48.930
I was checking
Al-Zarian's computer,

09:48.960 --> 09:50.960
double-checking
everything we planted.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.230
And?
The bank that we use in
Switzerland just e-mailed him,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.630
rejecting one of the transfers
we made in Al-Zarian's name.

09:56.660 --> 09:59.160
You know how
to resubmit it?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.700
I'm not sure.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.130
Are you getting this?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.530
Tony's got something
on his phone that's

10:03.560 --> 10:05.700
encrypting his location.
I'm trying to get around it.

10:06.460 --> 10:07.460
All right.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.700
Call our man in Zurich.

10:09.730 --> 10:11.530
He'll walk you through it.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.860
All right. I just wanted

10:12.900 --> 10:14.930
to get your authorization
before I did that.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.360
Any other problems?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
No.

10:18.430 --> 10:19.730
Good.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.160
Chloe, did you get that?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.730
I didn't have time to decrypt
all the location data.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.130
All I know right now

10:24.160 --> 10:26.030
is that he's somewhere
in the Adams Morgan district.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.630
We're running out of time.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.230
We're going to have
to narrow that down.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.130
I'm trying. I have to decrypt
the rest of the location data.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.200
How long is that going to take?
I don't know.

10:33.230 --> 10:35.200
Damn it, Chloe, we've got
to do better than that.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.300
I need to get off the phone.

10:36.330 --> 10:38.800
Janis, I want you to
contact Metro P.D.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.100
I want you to get them
to move their Hazmat teams

10:41.130 --> 10:42.960
and their Tactical teams
over to Adams Morgan.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.200
We're on our way now.
Let's go.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.200
MAN (over P.A.):
Metro passengers, this weekend

10:54.230 --> 10:56.730
there will be no Blue Line
Express service

10:56.760 --> 10:58.560
to Arlington and McClean.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.360
Express service will be
resumed on Monday.

11:11.530 --> 11:12.900
I need you to call the police.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.030
Excuse me?

11:14.060 --> 11:15.800
Speak up, sir.

11:15.830 --> 11:17.500
I can't do that.

11:17.530 --> 11:18.700
They're listening.

11:18.730 --> 11:20.100
Who's listening?

11:20.130 --> 11:21.630
The people who have my brother.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.730
The terrorists.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.760
They're going to
kill my brother

11:26.800 --> 11:28.730
unless I do what they say.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.560
They want me to
get on this train.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.730
That's it?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.030
Just get on
the train?
Yes, please.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.230
You have to help me, okay?

11:35.260 --> 11:36.560
You have to call the police.

11:40.330 --> 11:41.660
Is there a
problem here, sir?

11:41.700 --> 11:44.030
Yes, yes, thank you, officer.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.260
Please, I need your help.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.560
Sir, just calm down
and step this way.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.300
What is it?

11:50.330 --> 11:51.800
Listen, they have
my brother hostage.

11:51.830 --> 11:53.300
Okay, you have
to believe me!

11:53.330 --> 11:56.130
Put the earpiece back in.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.430
What?

11:58.460 --> 12:00.660
I said, put the
earpiece back in.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.830
Now.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
ALMEIDA:
Listen, Jibraan,

12:16.230 --> 12:18.100
I understand you had to try.

12:18.130 --> 12:20.200
But don't do it again.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.300
Your brother's life
depends on it.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.900
Yes, okay, please, okay,
just don't hurt him, okay?

12:24.930 --> 12:26.630
Well, that's up to you.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.730
Yes, I'll do whatever
you say, okay?

12:28.760 --> 12:30.030
I won't cause any
more problems.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.160
I promise.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.530
All right.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.560
Do you remember
your instructions?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.730
Yes, uh...

12:36.760 --> 12:40.560
Westbound Red Line
to Washington Center.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.530
We'll be watching.

12:42.560 --> 12:46.000
We're always watching.

13:14.130 --> 13:16.560
(cell phone ringing)

13:17.500 --> 13:18.930
Hello?

13:18.960 --> 13:21.130
Ms. Taylor,
this is Agent Pierce.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.430
Yes, Aaron?

13:22.460 --> 13:24.500
Secretary Woods
was asking for you.

13:24.530 --> 13:26.960
You told me you were
retiring to the residence,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.230
but upstairs detail confirmed

13:29.260 --> 13:30.800
that you're not there.

13:30.830 --> 13:32.030
Why is Tim looking for me?

13:32.060 --> 13:34.160
The Justice Department
is investigating

13:34.200 --> 13:35.700
the Jonas Hodges car bombing.

13:35.730 --> 13:37.930
They're requesting
phone and internet records

13:37.960 --> 13:39.930
and want to interview
everyone, as well.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.300
I didn't realize
Justice was getting involved.

13:42.330 --> 13:44.130
Apparently, there
were only 11 people

13:44.160 --> 13:45.730
who knew Hodges was alive.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.300
It stands to reason that
information was leaked.

13:48.330 --> 13:50.260
Okay, I'll get there
as soon as I can.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.400
Where are you?

13:51.430 --> 13:54.660
I needed to run a
personal errand.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.030
Ma'am, am I to understand

13:56.060 --> 13:57.960
that you've left the
White House premises

13:58.000 --> 13:59.760
without Secret
Service protection?

13:59.800 --> 14:00.800
I won't be long, Aaron.

14:00.830 --> 14:01.900
Ten minutes.

14:01.930 --> 14:03.100
Ms. Taylor,

14:03.130 --> 14:05.860
this is a serious
breach of protocol.

14:05.900 --> 14:09.160
Your safety is
my responsibility.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.400
Aaron, I know.

14:10.430 --> 14:12.130
I promise you
it won't happen again.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.030
Just cover for me
till I get back?

14:16.930 --> 14:18.860
Will you do that for me, Aaron?

14:19.760 --> 14:21.660
Yes, ma'am.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.300
Thank you.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.130
(sighs)

14:28.830 --> 14:30.830
(rustling)

14:30.860 --> 14:32.800
This is a mistake, Martin.
We shouldn't be meeting.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.060
Okay, you need to
calm down, Olivia.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.300
I needed to see you; you
were hysterical on the phone.

14:36.330 --> 14:39.460
No, you don't understand!
There's an investigation.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.830
Look, the Justice Department
is asking about my whereabouts!

14:42.860 --> 14:44.860
Okay, did you think
no one would bat an eye

14:44.900 --> 14:46.100
when a government
witness was murdered?

14:46.130 --> 14:49.400
I told you I changed my mind.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.100
I didn't transfer the funds.

14:51.130 --> 14:52.960
The man you put me
in touch with said

14:53.000 --> 14:54.760
he wouldn't act until
he received payment.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.600
Why would he go ahead
and kill Hodges

14:56.630 --> 14:57.900
if he wasn't paid?

14:57.930 --> 15:00.400
Because I told him to.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.130
What?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.130
He called me and told me

15:03.160 --> 15:04.400
the money hadn't
come through yet.

15:04.430 --> 15:06.560
I told him you were
good for it and to proceed.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.260
Why, Martin?
Why would you do that?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.360
Hodges was going into
Witness Protection,

15:10.400 --> 15:12.800
there was a finite
window of opportunity.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.530
And because it's
what you wanted.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.900
Right?

15:15.930 --> 15:18.200
Despite all my warnings
for you to reconsider,

15:18.230 --> 15:19.700
you looked me
straight in the eye

15:19.730 --> 15:23.400
and you said you
wanted Hodges dead,
to make it happen.

15:23.430 --> 15:26.430
And I did, and he's dead.

15:27.330 --> 15:29.800
Oh, my God...

15:29.830 --> 15:31.300
But my phone records...

15:31.330 --> 15:34.130
m-my computer...
everything--
Don't worry about
any of those.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.860
I'll send you a program to
erase your internet tracks.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.160
The calls to me mean nothing.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.160
Olivia, the time to worry

15:40.200 --> 15:42.330
about your conscience

15:42.360 --> 15:45.400
was before you
put this in motion.

15:45.430 --> 15:47.260
If you let this eat away at you,

15:47.300 --> 15:50.600
people are going to notice
and get suspicious.

15:50.630 --> 15:52.330
You will bring us both down...

15:52.360 --> 15:55.130
destroy your mother
and her administration.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.430
Think about it.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.630
Is that what you want?

15:58.660 --> 16:00.060
No.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.860
Okay, then pull
yourself together.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.860
I promise you,
this will all pass

16:04.900 --> 16:07.600
if you do what I say.

16:07.630 --> 16:10.130
Can you do that?

16:11.060 --> 16:13.130
Say it.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.760
I can do it.

16:18.530 --> 16:21.100
You need to transfer
the funds, Olivia.

16:21.130 --> 16:24.300
You do not want
this man unhappy with you.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.760
(phone ringing)

16:35.800 --> 16:37.100
Hey, honey.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.430
Sorry I woke you.

16:38.460 --> 16:39.730
No, no, no, that's okay.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.860
I've been up with Teri
a couple times anyway.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.700
She's been having a rough night.

16:43.730 --> 16:45.160
I think she misses her mother.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.960
Oh, well, listen,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.700
I just called to let you know
that my flight's been delayed.

16:49.730 --> 16:51.260
Yeah, how long?

16:51.300 --> 16:52.360
Well, they're saying an hour.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.700
Which probably means two.

16:53.730 --> 16:56.130
Okay.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.260
What?

16:57.300 --> 16:58.160
I don't know, maybe

16:58.200 --> 16:59.660
you should see
this as a sign.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.030
A sign?

17:01.060 --> 17:04.030
That you should stay there--
try to convince your father

17:04.060 --> 17:05.960
that, uh, he should be
spending whatever time

17:06.000 --> 17:07.660
he has left with
his only daughter.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.900
As much as I want to,

17:09.930 --> 17:11.660
he made it very clear

17:11.700 --> 17:14.099
that he does not want me
around to watch him die.

17:14.130 --> 17:16.400
Okay, all right.

17:16.430 --> 17:17.730
Sorry I brought it up.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.099
Teri and I will be
at the airport to pick you up.

17:20.130 --> 17:22.500
(phone beeping)
Wha-- Oh...

17:22.530 --> 17:24.730
My battery is dying.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.660
Is the hospital okay with that?

17:26.700 --> 17:27.730
Yeah, I talked to Kevin.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.000
He said he'd cover my rounds.

17:29.030 --> 17:30.130
Well, that's-that's...
that's great.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.830
Well, I can't wait
to see you guys.

17:31.860 --> 17:32.830
Me, too.
(phone beeping)

17:32.860 --> 17:33.860
Okay, bye.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.600
(sighs)

17:37.460 --> 17:40.360
MAN:
Sara, where are the
boarding passes?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.430
WOMAN:
I saw you put them
in your coat, honey.

17:42.460 --> 17:43.560
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.830
That's all right.
Sorry.

17:44.860 --> 17:46.030
Everything okay?

17:46.060 --> 17:48.330
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.160
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
This stop, L Street.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.930
This stop, L Street.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.630
(brakes squeak)

18:39.660 --> 18:41.160
(hydraulic whoosh)

18:43.460 --> 18:45.530
Next and last stop,

18:45.560 --> 18:47.760
Washington Center.

18:53.130 --> 18:54.430
The package is in place.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.030
The dispersal mechanism
is set to go off while

18:57.060 --> 18:58.830
the train is stopped
at Washington Center.

18:58.860 --> 19:00.200
Good, we're on the move.

19:00.230 --> 19:02.360
I'll pick you up at 22nd.

19:04.530 --> 19:06.800
(engine turns)

19:10.230 --> 19:12.300
(computer beeping)

19:12.330 --> 19:14.460
Jack, I unlocked
Tony's location data.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.200
Where is he?
Three blocks

19:16.230 --> 19:18.200
immediately south
of your position on 22nd.

19:18.230 --> 19:20.100
Where exactly on 22nd?

19:20.130 --> 19:22.460
West side of the block
you're coming up on.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.830
900 feet ahead of you...

19:23.860 --> 19:26.530
800 feet...

19:26.560 --> 19:29.160
All teams, bring your
units up from the south

19:29.200 --> 19:30.460
and prepare to move in.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.730
Okay, we've got him.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.300
Suspect is in a black van.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.000
We can't let this
turn into a pursuit.

19:36.030 --> 19:38.100
Hold on.

19:38.130 --> 19:38.900
(thud)

19:38.930 --> 19:41.800
(tires screeching)

19:41.830 --> 19:43.160
Hold on!

19:45.330 --> 19:47.360
(grunting)

19:47.400 --> 19:50.330
(sirens blaring)

19:54.500 --> 19:56.000
Ready?

19:59.200 --> 20:00.600
Tony was trying to destroy

20:00.630 --> 20:03.060
some kind of device
when I grabbed him!

20:03.100 --> 20:05.030
I got it!

20:08.030 --> 20:09.000
(grunting)

20:09.030 --> 20:11.300
Lock down this piece of crap.

20:12.730 --> 20:14.030
What do you got?

20:14.060 --> 20:16.230
Some kind of mobile computer,
but he damaged it pretty badly.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.200
This has got something
to do with the attack.

20:18.230 --> 20:19.560
Contact Chloe,
see what we can find.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.100
I'm gonna sweep the van
for the canister.

20:24.030 --> 20:26.260
(groaning)

20:26.300 --> 20:29.430
(labored breathing)

20:41.730 --> 20:43.800
CHLOE:
Tony's UMPC device is damaged
everywhere I look.

20:43.830 --> 20:46.600
I don't think there's a way
to get it back up and running.

20:46.630 --> 20:48.000
Well, then try
a partial reconstruct.

20:48.030 --> 20:50.360
Anything that can help us
find out what Tony's been up to.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.560
At this point
I don't even know

20:51.600 --> 20:53.160
about our chances
of even doing that.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.400
Chloe.
I know.

20:54.430 --> 20:56.530
Do me a favor.
Send me your screen.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.400
Why?

20:58.430 --> 20:59.760
Why not?

21:05.360 --> 21:06.660
Huh.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.030
What?
(computer beeping)

21:09.060 --> 21:11.760
Looks like I can reconstruct the
memory state of the UMPC

21:11.800 --> 21:13.130
at the time it was damaged.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.660
No. There isn't
enough intact data.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.200
Yeah, there is,
in the PROM module.

21:16.230 --> 21:18.630
A lot of handheld devices back
up their memory state there.

21:18.660 --> 21:20.430
That can't be done,

21:20.460 --> 21:22.200
not without the
file headers.
Really?

21:23.800 --> 21:26.360
Mr. Bauer, Almeida just
regained consciousness.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.330
Thank you.
Stay with this.

21:37.660 --> 21:41.330
I need you to walk away.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.800
Please, you and your men
just walk away.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.400
Where is it?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
Where's the canister?

22:03.230 --> 22:06.030
I am not going to stop
until you tell me where it is.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.600
(groaning)

22:11.430 --> 22:13.430
Huh?! Huh?!

22:14.430 --> 22:17.960
Why did you betray me?

22:19.900 --> 22:22.430
Why?

22:26.830 --> 22:29.200
I have nothing left to lose.

22:29.230 --> 22:31.730
You either tell me where that
canister is, or so help me God,

22:31.760 --> 22:34.600
I will lay you down
right here, right now.

22:34.630 --> 22:38.800
You think I've got
anything left to lose, Jack?

22:39.760 --> 22:41.460
Do it.

22:53.930 --> 22:55.600
JANIS:
There were a number
of applets running.

22:55.630 --> 22:57.400
We should be able
to run them on our hardware.

22:57.430 --> 22:58.830
I'm uploading a mirror
to you now.

22:58.860 --> 22:59.930
(computer beeps)

22:59.960 --> 23:00.960
You should have it.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.160
You think it's Jibraan?

23:02.200 --> 23:04.600
I can't tell.
But whoever it is,

23:04.630 --> 23:07.300
they're southbound on
Connecticut at 30 miles an hour.

23:07.330 --> 23:08.800
JANIS:
And they just went

23:08.830 --> 23:10.200
right through
St. Matthew's Cathedral

23:10.230 --> 23:11.330
and out the other side.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.100
He's got to be
on the Metro.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.600
CHLOE:
Yes, the Red Line

23:17.630 --> 23:18.600
ending at Washington Center.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.800
Washington Center's the target.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.160
Put these in the car.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.000
Jack, we have Jibraan.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.660
(tires squeal)

23:50.200 --> 23:52.630
Jibraan is on the Metro,
headed toward Washington Center.

23:52.660 --> 23:53.830
Chloe, it's Jack.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.600
I'm back on comm.
How much time do we have?

23:55.630 --> 23:57.400
Not long.
He's almost there.

23:57.430 --> 23:59.200
Okay, listen.
Tony had to be able

23:59.230 --> 24:00.430
to communicate
with Jibraan somehow.

24:00.460 --> 24:02.300
See if they were using
some kind of comm frequency

24:02.330 --> 24:03.830
that was strong enough to work
in the subway.

24:03.860 --> 24:06.960
Looking... okay.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.030
Wait.

24:08.060 --> 24:09.560
There's a proprietary
K-band running.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.160
That's it.
Okay. Patch me through.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.030
Go ahead, Jack.

24:14.060 --> 24:15.700
Jibraan?

24:15.730 --> 24:17.700
Jibraan, my name is Jack Bauer.

24:17.730 --> 24:18.960
Can you hear me?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.360
Uh, yes.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.300
Your brother is safe.
I'm working with the FBI.

24:22.330 --> 24:23.530
The man who was
holding him hostage

24:23.560 --> 24:24.700
has been taken
into custody.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.800
Let me talk to Hamid.

24:27.830 --> 24:29.060
He's not with us right now.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.660
No, no. I need to talk to him.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.700
Jibraan, listen to me.

24:31.730 --> 24:34.060
Your brother is safe,
but you are not.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.430
The people who
are doing this,

24:35.460 --> 24:36.860
they gave you some
kind of a package.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.200
No, no, no.
They didn't give me anything.

24:39.230 --> 24:41.200
ANNOUNCER:
This stop, Washington Center.
This will be the last stop.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.030
We've got real time
coverage of the station.
Okay.

24:43.060 --> 24:45.660
JACK:
Jibraan, these people
are trying to frame you

24:45.700 --> 24:46.830
for a terrorist attack.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.130
They had to give you
some kind of a package.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.230
No, no.

24:51.930 --> 24:53.660
Then it's got to be
on the train.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.030
I want you to start looking for
an abandoned suitcase,

24:56.060 --> 24:57.660
gym bag, knapsack,
anything like that.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.560
No, I can't tell.
There's nothing.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.500
It's got to be there.
Keep looking.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.060
It was a woman.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.430
What woman?

25:07.460 --> 25:10.630
She was with them when,
uh, when they took Hamid.

25:10.660 --> 25:12.700
I think maybe I saw her
get off the train.

25:12.730 --> 25:14.830
JACK:
Are you pulling into the
station right now?

25:14.860 --> 25:16.260
Uh, yes.

25:16.300 --> 25:19.100
Okay, I want you to stay
on the train

25:19.130 --> 25:21.860
and wait for all the passengers
to get off.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.860
(brakes screeching)

25:42.500 --> 25:43.830
It's a bomb, isn't it?

25:43.860 --> 25:45.130
It's a biological weapon.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.360
If it goes off, a lot
of people are going to die.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.930
Are all the passengers
off the train?

25:48.960 --> 25:50.060
Yes.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.900
Can you see the package?

25:51.930 --> 25:53.600
I don't know.

25:53.630 --> 25:54.600
Jibraan, keep looking.

25:54.630 --> 25:56.400
It's got to be there.

25:59.230 --> 26:00.830
Jibraan?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.800
Yes, yes. I see it.

26:02.830 --> 26:04.430
I see a duffel bag.
JACK: Okay.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.000
I need you to open it.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.700
Wait. Why me?

26:10.730 --> 26:12.100
Why must I do this?

26:12.130 --> 26:13.560
'Cause right now, you're
the only person that can

26:13.600 --> 26:15.430
and if you don't, thousands
of people are going to die.

26:15.460 --> 26:18.230
Jibraan, I need you
to open the bag.

26:20.260 --> 26:23.000
Look, I know
I'm asking you a lot.

26:23.030 --> 26:24.900
Please.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.130
Jibraan, are you still there?

26:32.160 --> 26:33.900
It looks like a bomb.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.100
I-I see a light.

26:37.130 --> 26:38.300
It's a timer.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.600
It's counting down.

26:39.630 --> 26:40.730
How much time is left?

26:40.760 --> 26:42.430
Uh, two minutes, eighteen seconds.

26:42.460 --> 26:44.000
That's not enough time
for us to get down to you.

26:44.030 --> 26:46.030
I want you to try
and get the device outside.

26:46.060 --> 26:47.200
There's an escalator
to your right.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.400
I want you to start moving now.

26:48.430 --> 26:49.460
Start moving now.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.630
I'll meet you on the street.

26:50.660 --> 26:51.760
We're about a minute out.

26:51.800 --> 26:52.900
(whispering):
Okay.

26:52.930 --> 26:54.830
Okay.

27:11.760 --> 27:12.500
(grunting and yelling)

27:12.530 --> 27:14.130
That's him.
Hold on!

27:14.160 --> 27:15.630
Hold on.
What's the hurry?

27:15.660 --> 27:17.960
I have to get out.
I have to get out.
What is that?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.760
Is that even yours?

27:21.530 --> 27:22.500
I have a bomb!

27:22.530 --> 27:23.530
(people screaming)
Okay?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.500
This is a bomb.
Get back!
Everybody, get back!

27:25.530 --> 27:27.560
Get back!
I have a bomb!

27:38.230 --> 27:40.730
(bystanders screaming)

27:40.760 --> 27:43.560
(siren blaring)

27:43.600 --> 27:44.760
(tires squeal)

27:44.800 --> 27:47.300
Wait, he's with us.
Jibraan!

27:47.330 --> 27:49.660
Jibraan. I'm the man who
was talking to you.

27:49.700 --> 27:52.000
Give me the canister.
Go with these men.
They'll help you. Go!

27:52.030 --> 27:54.130
(garbled radio transmission)

28:01.500 --> 28:02.360
(booming)

28:05.230 --> 28:06.830
(panting)

28:22.030 --> 28:23.000
(knocking)

28:23.030 --> 28:27.130
(panting)

28:28.430 --> 28:29.600
Is he all right?

28:30.930 --> 28:33.230
You're Mr. Bauer?
Yes.

28:33.260 --> 28:35.460
You did great.
Thank you for everything.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.100
I want to see my brother.

28:38.130 --> 28:40.000
I know. We're going
to bring him here.

28:40.030 --> 28:43.060
But right now, I'd like you to
go with Agent Moran, so he can

28:43.100 --> 28:45.200
take your statement, please.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.530
MORAN:
Follow me.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.400
Jack...
It's all right,
it's all right.

29:00.430 --> 29:01.830
You need to give
yourself a shot.

29:01.860 --> 29:04.530
I already did, 20 minutes ago.
It's not working.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.130
It's okay.
It's okay.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.500
We stopped it.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.630
(panting)

29:12.660 --> 29:14.730
You can finally rest.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.230
(grunts)

29:42.480 --> 29:44.210
WOMAN:
Can I have a piece of paper?

29:44.250 --> 29:46.810
MAN:
Yeah, sure, you
can have all this.

29:46.850 --> 29:48.880
What's that?
(clears throat)

29:48.910 --> 29:50.950
MAN:
This is section "A"; it's
the only thing I want.

29:50.980 --> 29:53.350
I'll give it to you
as soon as I'm done.

29:59.810 --> 30:02.250
Excuse me,
do you mind if I sit here?

30:02.280 --> 30:04.950
No, of course not.

30:05.810 --> 30:07.450
(sighs)

30:07.480 --> 30:08.410
You heading home?

30:08.450 --> 30:09.650
Yeah.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.010
Us, too.

30:11.050 --> 30:12.310
We live in Glendale.

30:12.350 --> 30:13.780
Woodland Hills.
Oh!

30:13.810 --> 30:15.150
My husband's
parents live there.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.350
You know
the Pelusos?

30:17.380 --> 30:19.810
I don't think so.

30:20.780 --> 30:22.910
Do you mind doing me a favor?

30:22.950 --> 30:23.950
Sure.

30:23.980 --> 30:26.880
Do you see the man
behind us at a table?

30:26.910 --> 30:29.950
He's wearing
a suit.

30:29.980 --> 30:32.450
Uh, short, dark hair?

30:32.480 --> 30:33.680
Yes.

30:33.710 --> 30:36.410
Yes, is he
staring over here?

30:36.450 --> 30:37.650
No.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.180
You know him?

30:39.210 --> 30:41.450
No, it's just that he was
staring at me earlier.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.810
Well, you're very pretty.

30:42.850 --> 30:43.950
(sighs)

30:44.950 --> 30:46.610
Oh.

30:46.650 --> 30:49.450
What?
No, he's moving away now.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.080
I've got her in sight.

30:54.110 --> 30:55.750
She's waiting
at the gate now.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.550
They should begin boarding
within the hour.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.210
Okay, look, I know that
the bioweapons threat is over,

30:59.250 --> 31:00.910
but I'd feel a lot better
if you'd watch over her

31:00.950 --> 31:02.350
until she gets on that plane.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.210
Yes, sir, I'll let you know
when she's in the air.

31:04.250 --> 31:05.550
Thanks.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.250
I need you to contact
the Bureau office.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.350
Tell them we need
a full interrogation package

31:09.380 --> 31:10.310
ready for when we arrive.

31:10.350 --> 31:12.410
Yes, sir.
Thanks.

31:12.450 --> 31:14.680
(garbled radio transmission)

31:17.750 --> 31:19.610
RENEE:
Jack?

31:19.650 --> 31:21.150
I just got word.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.850
Jonas Hodges was killed
with a car bomb

31:22.880 --> 31:23.850
less than an hour ago.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.380
What? How?

31:25.410 --> 31:27.280
We don't have any leads yet,
but obviously somehow

31:27.310 --> 31:30.380
the people he was working for
found out he was still alive.

31:31.750 --> 31:33.180
That means they're going
to be coming after Tony.

31:33.210 --> 31:34.410
We need to transport
him in a convoy--

31:34.450 --> 31:35.750
full guard detail,
weapons ready.

31:35.780 --> 31:38.480
We're not losing him
again.
Okay.

31:40.350 --> 31:42.950
(garbled radio transmission,
siren wailing)

31:46.050 --> 31:48.080
The FBI located Al-Zarian.

31:48.110 --> 31:49.480
There was nothing we could do.

31:49.510 --> 31:51.850
You're telling me
the canister is gone.

31:56.010 --> 31:58.680
Damn it!

31:59.610 --> 32:01.080
Without that
pathogen,

32:01.110 --> 32:03.580
everything that we've
worked for is finished.

32:03.610 --> 32:05.750
You should also know
the FBI has Tony.

32:05.780 --> 32:08.110
Then you need
to have him eliminated.

32:08.150 --> 32:09.980
Alan.
He knows too much,
Cara.

32:10.010 --> 32:11.580
We can't take the risk
that he'll break.

32:11.610 --> 32:13.210
You need to
take him out.

32:13.250 --> 32:16.550
I'm trying to tell you
that won't be necessary.

32:16.580 --> 32:19.180
Tony won't be
in custody for long.

32:19.210 --> 32:20.280
What are you
talking about?

32:20.310 --> 32:21.810
Trust me.

32:21.850 --> 32:23.780
We've got
another play.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.210
You'd better have.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.950
ANNOUNCER:
The incoming flight from Boston
will be arriving shortly.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.010
Once the passengers have
deplaned

32:36.050 --> 32:37.780
and the maintenance crew is
given a chance

32:37.810 --> 32:38.850
to clean up the aircraft,

32:38.880 --> 32:40.610
we should be able
to begin boarding.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.480
We appreciate your patience.
Thank you.

32:42.510 --> 32:45.350
Well, at least we know
the plane's on its way.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.050
I'll believe that
when I see it.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.780
Well, I'm gonna get
some coffee.

32:49.810 --> 32:51.950
Does anybody want anything?

32:51.980 --> 32:53.050
I'll take a decaf.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.180
Nothing for me,
thanks.

32:54.210 --> 32:56.680
Oh, come on.
Are you sure?
It's my treat.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.050
No, no, thank you.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.350
All right.

33:02.050 --> 33:03.810
Your husband's
really nice.

33:03.850 --> 33:05.410
Hmm, he has his moments.

33:05.450 --> 33:06.750
(laughs)

33:06.780 --> 33:09.110
You know what?
I'm, I'm gonna use the restroom.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.550
Do you mind
watching my bag?
Sure.

33:10.580 --> 33:11.710
Thank you.

33:25.710 --> 33:28.780
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Flight 535, nonstop service
to Seattle

33:28.810 --> 33:30.480
is now ready for boarding.

33:30.510 --> 33:33.250
All passengers please report
to Gate 17-A.

33:54.210 --> 33:56.910
(gasping)

34:11.480 --> 34:12.909
(bones snap)

34:48.429 --> 34:49.400
Miss Taylor.

34:49.429 --> 34:50.600
Agent Pierce.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.030
I know you're upset
I went off protocol,

34:53.060 --> 34:55.460
but as I told you,
it won't happen again.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.800
No, ma'am, it won't...

34:56.830 --> 35:00.060
or you'll need to find someone
else to do this job.

35:00.100 --> 35:03.430
Aaron, that won't be necessary.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.930
Ma'am, you said you left
the grounds

35:05.960 --> 35:07.360
to run a personal errand.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.960
May I ask
what it was?

35:13.660 --> 35:18.930
I just needed to get out of
here, be alone, clear my head,

35:18.960 --> 35:22.500
if only for
a short time.

35:22.530 --> 35:28.130
Everything that's happened
today-- being held hostage,

35:28.160 --> 35:32.030
Jonas Hodges' murder...

35:32.060 --> 35:37.030
and seeing my father so weak
and vulnerable...

35:43.650 --> 35:45.360
I was feeling overwhelmed.

35:47.870 --> 35:51.700
Aaron, I'm trying to live up
to my mother's expectations.

35:53.730 --> 35:55.460
And I didn't want her--

35:55.500 --> 35:57.700
or anyone else for that matter--

35:57.730 --> 36:00.430
to know I was being affected
by the pressure.

36:03.850 --> 36:05.860
I hope you can understand that.

36:06.100 --> 36:09.960
Yes, ma'am, I think I can.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.300
You feeling all right now?

36:13.330 --> 36:16.730
I am, actually.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.900
I guess I just needed
to tell someone

36:18.930 --> 36:20.630
what was going on with me.

36:23.060 --> 36:25.060
I'm glad it was someone
I could trust.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.800
Well, thank you, ma'am.

36:27.830 --> 36:30.260
I'll have those phone
and internet

36:30.300 --> 36:32.030
records ready
for the Justice Department

36:32.060 --> 36:33.100
investigators shortly.

36:33.130 --> 36:36.360
Yes, ma'am.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.900
Thank you, Aaron.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.060
(murmurs)

36:50.100 --> 36:52.800
(speed dialing tones)

36:52.830 --> 36:54.300
(phone rings)

37:01.360 --> 37:02.300
This is Kanin.

37:02.330 --> 37:04.430
Sir, this is
Agent Pierce.

37:04.460 --> 37:06.000
I hope I didn't
wake you.

37:06.030 --> 37:08.530
No, Agent Pierce,
I'm wide awake.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.760
What can I do for you?

37:09.800 --> 37:11.860
Mr. Kanin, some years ago,

37:11.900 --> 37:15.500
while I served
on President Palmer's detail,

37:15.530 --> 37:18.460
I was made aware
of some modifications made

37:18.500 --> 37:19.900
to the Chief of Staff's office.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.000
You mean, during
Mike Novick's tenure.

37:22.030 --> 37:24.530
Yes, sir, specifically
the installation

37:24.560 --> 37:26.960
of a voice-activated
recording system.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.360
It allows staff meetings
to be logged and archived.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.800
If you're asking whether I used
the recording equipment,

37:32.830 --> 37:34.230
the answer's yes.

37:34.260 --> 37:37.660
Sir, did you disconnect it
when you resigned

37:37.700 --> 37:38.730
and left your office?

37:38.760 --> 37:40.760
No. Why you asking?

37:40.800 --> 37:43.860
I'd prefer not to answer
that at this time.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.730
I need to know how to access
the digital recorder.

37:46.760 --> 37:50.430
You can't. It's secured
with a biometric lock.

37:50.460 --> 37:51.500
You need my thumbprint.

37:51.530 --> 37:54.030
Look, Aaron,
if you want my help,

37:54.060 --> 37:57.160
you're gonna have to tell me
what this is about.

37:57.200 --> 38:00.500
Olivia Taylor's still using
my office.

38:00.530 --> 38:03.800
Does this have to do with her?

38:03.830 --> 38:06.660
I really can't talk about this
over the phone right now.

38:06.700 --> 38:10.900
I'll be at the White House
within a half hour.

38:10.930 --> 38:12.760
Thank you, sir.

38:14.260 --> 38:15.630
(phone beeps)

38:39.600 --> 38:41.730
(sighs)

38:41.760 --> 38:44.530
Do you have something
you'd like

38:44.560 --> 38:45.530
to say to me?

38:45.560 --> 38:46.600
Like what?

38:46.630 --> 38:47.630
Oh, I think you know.

38:47.660 --> 38:48.930
I don't think I do.

38:48.960 --> 38:53.260
How about "Good job, Janice,
on reconstructing the UMPC"?

38:53.300 --> 38:54.860
Or "Just maybe I should have
considered the possibility

38:54.900 --> 38:56.260
that you actually know
what you're doing."

38:56.300 --> 38:57.960
Oh, you don't know me,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.760
but if you did,
you would understand

38:59.800 --> 39:01.360
that this is the last place
you should look

39:01.400 --> 39:02.430
for any type of validation.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.360
How about just acknowledging
you were wrong?!

39:09.830 --> 39:10.960
We're almost ready
to go.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.960
Okay. Is this her?

39:13.000 --> 39:17.830
Uh, yes, but when I saw her
in the Metro, she had on

39:17.860 --> 39:21.000
this dark wig
and a leather jacket.

39:21.030 --> 39:23.800
Jibraan,
your brother's here.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.230
Hamid!

39:27.260 --> 39:28.530
Let's pack up.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.500
Hamid!

39:51.000 --> 39:54.060
Well, the coffee place
over here-- excuse me--

39:54.100 --> 39:55.500
didn't have decaf,

39:55.530 --> 39:59.060
so I had to go all the way to
the other end of the terminal,

39:59.100 --> 40:03.160
but I want you to know
I got it.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.330
Thank you.

40:16.060 --> 40:17.930
(keyboard clacking)

40:23.200 --> 40:25.560
(phone rings)

40:25.600 --> 40:26.560
This is Bauer.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.200
I'm sending a link
to your phone.

40:28.230 --> 40:29.860
It's something I think
you should see.

40:29.900 --> 40:32.160
Who is this?

40:32.200 --> 40:35.100
Open the link,
Mr. Bauer.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.760
Who the hell is this?

40:44.800 --> 40:46.830
Your daughter's in the company
of our operatives.

40:46.860 --> 40:49.430
And Agent Franks has already
been neutralized.

40:49.460 --> 40:50.930
You will help Tony Almeida
escape

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
or my people will murder
your daughter.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.330
Any effort to contact her
or warn anybody about this

40:56.360 --> 40:58.860
will have the same result,
do you understand?

40:58.900 --> 41:01.060
What you're asking me
to do is impossible.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.360
Tony Almeida's already been
secured.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.560
He's under heavy guard.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.230
Well, that's
your problem.

41:05.260 --> 41:07.130
Put this call on
your earpiece

41:07.160 --> 41:08.400
and keep the line open.

41:08.430 --> 41:10.300
I'm gonna be listening
to everything you say.

41:10.330 --> 41:12.560
Now, Bauer.

41:31.330 --> 41:33.830
You're gonna pay
for what you did to Larry.

41:37.930 --> 41:40.630
I thought you were going
with Moran.

41:40.660 --> 41:43.300
Changed my mind.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.460
I wanna see this through.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.800
(sirens wailing)

41:51.660 --> 41:54.430
You're gonna make your move
to break Almeida out soon.

41:54.460 --> 41:58.300
I'm gonna tell you what to do
and when to do it.

41:58.330 --> 41:59.960
Oh, and Mr. Bauer,

42:00.000 --> 42:03.260
if any of those agents
in that van get in the way,

42:03.300 --> 42:06.500
you will have to eliminate them,
or your daughter will die.
