00:05.806 --> 00:07.272
HI. I'M SAMANTHA BEE,

00:07.274 --> 00:08.774
LATE NIGHT HOST,
MEDIA MOGUL,

00:08.776 --> 00:10.509
AND ONE OF ABOUT 5 WOMEN
IN THE WORLD

00:10.578 --> 00:12.211
WHO GETS TO TALK
FOR 21 MINUTES

00:12.279 --> 00:13.846
WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.281
HEY. REMEMBER
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.984
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T.

00:19.053 --> 00:22.087
CBS CEO LES MOONVES
WILL REMAIN IN HIS JOB

00:22.156 --> 00:23.389
WHILE THE NETWORK INVESTIGATES

00:23.457 --> 00:25.491
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS
AGAINST HIM.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.426
MAN: CHRIS HARDWICK'S CAREER
GETTING BACK ON TRACK

00:27.495 --> 00:30.162
AS HE IS SET TO RESUME
HIS ROLES AT NBC.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.464
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE
OF THAT STANFORD UNIVERSITY

00:32.533 --> 00:34.333
SWIMMER BROCK TURNER,
WHO WAS FOUND GUILTY

00:34.402 --> 00:36.201
OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING
AN UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.736
TURNER'S ATTORNEYS NOW ARGUE
THE DECISION

00:37.805 --> 00:39.705
SHOULD BE OVERTURNED
IN PART BECAUSE TURNER

00:39.774 --> 00:41.006
KEPT HIS CLOTHES ON.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.809
WELL, LISTENING TO WOMEN
WAS NICE WHILE IT LASTED.

00:43.878 --> 00:46.045
LET'S LOOK BACK
AT THE BRIEF MOMENT IN HISTORY

00:46.113 --> 00:48.714
WHEN IT SEEMED LIKE THERE MIGHT
BE CONSEQUENCES FOR ABUSE.

00:48.783 --> 00:51.417
[VIVALDI'S "THE FOUR SEASONS,
SPRING" PLAYING]

00:51.485 --> 00:53.018
WOMAN:
HASHTAG #MEETOO.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.920
WOLF BLITZER: SEXUAL HARASSMENT
IN THE WORKPLACE.

00:54.989 --> 00:57.022
MAN: SEXUAL HARASSMENT
IN CONGRESS.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.190
SAY HARASSMENT
EVERYWHERE.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.324
EVERYWHERE.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.325
MASTURBATED IN FRONT OF HER

01:00.394 --> 01:01.627
DURING REPEATED MEETINGS.

01:01.696 --> 01:03.696
WOMAN: "NEWS IS
A FLIRTY BUSINESS."

01:03.764 --> 01:05.230
MAN: A BUTTON
UNDER HIS DESK.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.733
IN HIS BATHROBE.
WOMAN: IN HIS BATHROBE.

01:07.802 --> 01:08.934
WOMAN: IN AN UNTETHERED
BATHROBE.

01:09.003 --> 01:10.169
DON'T MAKE ME BEG.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.270
IS THIS AN ATTACK DOG
I HAVE HERE?

01:11.339 --> 01:13.305
HOLD IT. WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA--AAH!

01:17.144 --> 01:19.545
WHEN THE SCANDAL BROKE,
WEINSTEIN MADE

01:19.613 --> 01:22.848
AN APOLOGY-LIKE STATEMENT IN
THE "NEW YORK POST," SAYING...

01:27.888 --> 01:30.122
OH, MY GOD. I'M SO
BEHIND ON THE SLANG.

01:30.191 --> 01:35.027
IS A FACILITY WHAT PEOPLE
CALL HELL?

01:35.096 --> 01:38.664
AT LEAST IN--
AT LEAST IN WEINSTEIN'S LETTER,

01:38.733 --> 01:41.033
HE SHOWED CONCERN
FOR THE VICTIMS,

01:41.102 --> 01:43.068
SPECIFICALLY HIMSELF.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.212
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK,
WHITE COSBY.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.015
NOBODY ASKED FOR YOUR
ALL ABOUT ME-A CULPA.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.216
DON'T BLAME THE SIXTIES
AND SEVENTIES

01:57.284 --> 01:58.851
FOR YOUR SHITTY
DECISION-MAKING.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.519
IT'S SERIAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT,

02:00.588 --> 02:03.355
NOT A MONKEES TATTOO.

02:03.424 --> 02:06.725
IT'S TIME TO ASK OURSELVES

02:06.794 --> 02:10.863
CAN MEN WHO HATE WOMEN BE
OBJECTIVE JOURNALISTS?

02:10.931 --> 02:12.264
HA HA! THAT WAS
A TRICK QUESTION.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.966
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT MEN
WHO HATE WOMEN

02:14.035 --> 02:16.869
CAN BE ANYTHING
THEY PUT THEIR MINDS TO.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.337
TAKE CHARLIE ROSE.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.472
CHRISTINE ROMANS: 8 WOMEN TELL
THE "WASHINGTON POST"

02:20.541 --> 02:23.442
LONGTIME TELEVISION HOST
CHARLIE ROSE

02:23.511 --> 02:25.110
MADE UNWANTED
SEXUAL ADVANCES,

02:25.179 --> 02:28.681
INCLUDING GROPING,
MAKING LEWD PONE CALLS,

02:28.749 --> 02:31.817
AND WALKING AROUND NAKED
IN THEIR PRESENCE.

02:31.886 --> 02:35.421
UNTIL HIS FIRING, CHARLIE ROSE
WAS A MEDIA INSTITUTION.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.390
THE GUY WHO LIKED TO SHOW
HIS FRESHLY SHOWERED DICK

02:38.459 --> 02:40.926
TO FEMALE EMPLOYEES WAS THE SAME
ONE WHO GOT TO INTERVIEW

02:40.995 --> 02:43.629
THE FIRST MAJOR FEMALE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,

02:43.698 --> 02:46.398
AND HE MADE SURE TO PRESS HER
ABOUT THE IMPORTANT STUFF--

02:46.467 --> 02:47.633
E-MAILS!

02:47.702 --> 02:50.235
DO YOU THINK
THE E-MAIL CRISIS

02:50.304 --> 02:53.572
CONTRIBUTED
TO THE QUESTION
OF TRUST?

02:53.641 --> 02:56.342
AND IT HASN'T BEEN
DETERMINED THAT
THERE WAS NO HACKING.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.210
WELL, THERE'S
NO EVIDENCE OF IT.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.745
THERE'S NO
EVIDENCE OF IT...
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF IT.

02:59.814 --> 03:01.146
BUT SOME WOULD
SUGGEST THAT THAT'S
THE REASON...

03:01.215 --> 03:02.681
WELL--
THAT THEY WERE
VERY GOOD AT IT

03:02.750 --> 03:04.049
NO--
BECAUSE THERE'S
NO EVIDENCE OF IT.

03:04.118 --> 03:05.751
WELL--
AND THAT YOU EXPOSED--
AS YOU KNOW--

03:05.820 --> 03:07.853
THAT--CHARLIE, THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.788
"THERE'S EVIDENCE
THAT YOU EXPOSED:

03:09.857 --> 03:13.592
THE CHARLIE ROSE'S
PENIS STORY."

03:13.661 --> 03:16.395
THE HARDEST THING
ABOUT THESE REVELATIONS

03:16.464 --> 03:18.130
IS THEY'RE NOT
REALLY REVELATIONS.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.632
THESE MEN HAVE BEEN SHITTY
THE WHOLE TIME.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.034
TAKE MATT LAUER.

03:22.103 --> 03:23.602
NICE TO SEE YOU.
MORNING, MATT.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.104
SEEN A LOT
OF YOU LATELY.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.238
LET'S JUST GET IT
OUT OF THE WAY.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.873
YOU HAD A LITTLE
WARDROBE MALFUNCTION.

03:30.111 --> 03:31.710
CAN I HAVE
ONE FINAL KISS?

03:31.779 --> 03:33.012
OH, WAIT. EASY.
WHAT ARE YOU--

03:33.080 --> 03:34.179
DON'T MAKE ME BEG.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.381
IS THIS AN ATTACK DOG
I HAVE HERE?

03:35.449 --> 03:37.216
HOLD IT. WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA--AAH!

03:37.284 --> 03:39.952
HE MOLESTED A MUPPET
ON LIVE TV!

03:40.021 --> 03:42.154
WHICH I GUESS QUALIFIED HIM

03:42.223 --> 03:43.756
TO MODERATE
A PRESIDENTIAL FORUM,

03:43.824 --> 03:46.759
AND HE USED THAT PLATFORM
TO SEE HOW PRESIDENTIAL

03:46.827 --> 03:50.229
CLINTON COULD BE
WHILE ALSO BEING SHUSHED.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.630
LAUER: I'M GONNA
JUMP IN.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.998
I WILL--I WILL--
I WANT TO GET TO
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.133
AND I'M GONNA
JUMP IN.
WE'RE GONNA FIX--

03:54.201 --> 03:55.467
AS BRIEFLY
AS YOU CAN.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.735
BUT I WANT TO SAY JUST
ONE ADDITIONAL THING.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.437
I'VE GOT 30 SECONDS.
LEFT.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.006
OH, YEAH. NOW I REMEMBER
WATCHING THAT FORUM.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.442
THAT WAS THE DAY
MY ENTIRE FEMALE STAFF

04:03.511 --> 04:05.944
STARTED THEIR PERIODS
OUT OF THEIR EYES

04:06.013 --> 04:07.746
FROM PURE RAGE.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.648
YOU CAN'T JUST INTERRUPT
WOMEN WHEN THEY'RE TALKING

04:09.717 --> 04:10.783
LIKE THAT, MATT.

04:10.851 --> 04:11.950
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS,

04:12.019 --> 04:13.886
EVERY BUSINESS MEETING EVER?

04:13.954 --> 04:17.156
AND FELLOW CREEP AND PART-TIME
SMIRK MODEL MARK HALPERIN WAS--

04:17.224 --> 04:20.159
SURPRISE, SURPRISE--
OBSESSED WITH HILLARY,

04:20.227 --> 04:22.027
SO WHEN COVERING
HER CANDIDACY,

04:22.096 --> 04:24.530
HE ASKED THE INTELLIGENT,
NUANCED QUESTION

04:24.598 --> 04:27.433
"WHY IS SHE NOT MORE LIKE MAN?"

04:27.501 --> 04:29.001
HE DOES IT
WITH HUMOR.

04:29.070 --> 04:30.469
SHE HAS TO LEARN
TO DO IT WITH HUMOR,

04:30.538 --> 04:33.539
AND WHEN SHE DOES
IT NOW, SHE'S BEING
KIND OF AGGRESSIVE

04:33.607 --> 04:34.807
BUT NOT THAT FUNNY.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.275
"KIND OF AGGRESSIVE
AND NOT THAT FUNNY:"

04:36.344 --> 04:39.011
THE MARK HALPERIN'S
PENIS STORY."

04:39.080 --> 04:41.480
BECAUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
IS RAMPANT

04:41.549 --> 04:43.716
IN EVERY PROFESSION
IMAGINABLE--

04:43.784 --> 04:46.852
MEDICINE, FINANCE, TECHNOLOGY,

04:46.921 --> 04:49.621
ACADEMIA, PUBLISHING,
RESTAURANTS.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.558
WE TRIED TO FIND ONE PLACE
WHERE WOMEN WERE SAFE,

04:52.626 --> 04:55.060
SO WE GOOGLED "SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ANTARCTICA,"

04:55.129 --> 04:59.298
AND WE FOUND THIS ARTICLE
FROM 5 [BLEEP] DAYS AGO!

04:59.367 --> 05:01.767
YOU CAN'T EVEN GO
TO THE MOST REMOTE PART

05:01.836 --> 05:03.635
OF THE PLANET
WITHOUT SOME DUDE SWINGING

05:03.704 --> 05:06.005
HIS COLD, SHRIVELED DICK
YOUR WAY.

05:06.073 --> 05:09.208
PEOPLE LIKE ME HAD TO WADE
THROUGH A SEA

05:09.276 --> 05:13.879
OF PREHENSILE DICKS TO BUILD
THE WORLD WE NOW ENJOY...

05:13.948 --> 05:15.781
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

05:15.850 --> 05:20.119
AND PART OF ENJOYING
THAT WORLD

05:20.187 --> 05:24.289
IS SETTING A HIGHER STANDARD
FOR SEX THAN JUST NOT RAPE,

05:24.358 --> 05:25.958
AND WOMEN GET TO TALK
ABOUT IT

05:26.027 --> 05:28.494
IF MEN DON'T LIVE
UP TO THOSE STANDARDS,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.629
ESPECIALLY IF THAT MAN
WROTE A BOOK

05:30.698 --> 05:33.032
ABOUT HOW TO SEX GOOD,

05:33.100 --> 05:35.868
AND IF THAT SEEMS HARSH,
I'M SORRY.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.070
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY FOR A LOT OF THINGS.

05:38.139 --> 05:40.539
I'M SORRY THAT ANYONE
EVER THOUGHT THE CONTENTS

05:40.608 --> 05:42.675
OF THAT LIST OR ANY
OF THE OTHER WAYS

05:42.743 --> 05:43.942
WE PROTECT OURSELVES FROM MEN

05:44.011 --> 05:45.811
WERE YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.579
I'M SORRY YOU THOUGHT
YOU GOT TO CHOOSE

05:47.648 --> 05:49.548
WHAT EXPERIENCES
WE CAN SHARE

05:49.617 --> 05:52.351
OR HOW WE REACT TO THE SHITTY
WAYS WE'VE BEEN TREATED,

05:52.420 --> 05:53.752
AND TO MEN SPECIFICALLY,

05:53.821 --> 05:56.321
I'M SORRY OUR REQUEST
TO BE RESPECTED

05:56.390 --> 05:59.625
MAKES OFFICE CULTURE
A LITTLE LESS FUN AND FLIRTY,

05:59.694 --> 06:03.062
AND I'M SORRY WE TATTLED
ABOUT THAT STUFF YOU DID ON US,

06:03.130 --> 06:05.831
EVEN WHEN IT WAS
TOTALLY NOT RAPE,

06:05.900 --> 06:07.333
BUT LISTEN.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.134
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TUNE IN
TO YOUR PARTNER'S FEELINGS

06:09.203 --> 06:10.969
THROUGHOUT SEX,
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE

06:11.038 --> 06:12.838
[BLEEP] A PERSON AT ALL.

06:12.907 --> 06:14.039
MAY I SUGGEST A COIN PURSE

06:14.108 --> 06:16.442
OR A ZIPLOC BAG
FULL OF GRAPE JELLY?

06:16.510 --> 06:20.279
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

06:20.348 --> 06:24.550
MEN, IF YOU SAY
YOU'RE A FEMINIST,

06:24.618 --> 06:26.685
THEN [BLEEP] LIKE
A FEMINIST,

06:26.754 --> 06:28.520
AND IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT,

06:28.589 --> 06:30.489
TAKE OFF YOUR [BLEEP] PIN

06:30.558 --> 06:32.791
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT
YOUR ACCESSORIES.

06:32.860 --> 06:36.228
AT SOME POINT MANY YEARS
IN THE FUTURE,

06:36.297 --> 06:38.230
WE MAY HAVE A CONVERSATION

06:38.299 --> 06:39.531
ABOUT HOW SERIAL
SEXUAL HARASSERS

06:39.600 --> 06:41.500
CAN REENTER PUBLIC LIFE--
NOT THE RAPISTS.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.369
[BLEEP] YOU.
YOU SHOULD BE IN JAIL,

06:43.437 --> 06:45.404
BUT IF ANY OF YOU CREEPY [BLEEP]
WANT TO COME BACK,

06:45.473 --> 06:47.239
YOU HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

06:47.308 --> 06:49.975
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE PRICE OF REDEMPTION IS,

06:50.044 --> 06:51.910
BUT ALL THE MONEY
WOULD BE A GOOD START.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.380
ASHLEY JUDD IS SUING
HARVEY WEINSTEIN

06:54.448 --> 06:56.615
FOR FINANCIAL RESTITUTION
BECAUSE AFTER SHE REFUSED

06:56.684 --> 06:58.484
TO SLEEP WITH HIM
HE TOLD PETER JACKSON

06:58.552 --> 07:00.652
NOT TO CAST HER
IN "THE LORD OF THE RINGS,"

07:00.721 --> 07:03.822
AND, GOD, I DO HOPE
THIS TRIAL ALLOWS US

07:03.891 --> 07:06.992
TO DISCOVER THAT SHE WAS
UP TO PLAY LEGOLAS,

07:07.061 --> 07:09.762
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
WON'T SUFFICE AS REDEMPTION--

07:09.830 --> 07:11.797
SPENDING 6 MONTHS
HIDING OUT IN A VILLA

07:11.866 --> 07:13.732
FULL OF MARTINIS
AND FINGER SANDWICHES

07:13.801 --> 07:15.768
AND POKING YOUR HEADS OUT
EVERY 3 WEEKS

07:15.836 --> 07:17.670
LIKE PERVERTED LITTLE
PUNXSUTAWNEY PHILS TO GO,

07:17.738 --> 07:19.004
"HAS IT BEEN LONG ENOUGH?

07:19.073 --> 07:21.040
CAN I HAVE ACCESS
TO ASSISTANTS AGAIN, PLEASE?"

07:21.108 --> 07:22.541
BLANKET ANSWER--NO!

07:22.610 --> 07:24.176
SO AS LONG AS YOU WANT
TO KEEP PLAYING

07:24.245 --> 07:25.644
WHACK-A-MOLE FROM HELL,

07:25.713 --> 07:29.014
IT IS MY SOLEMN PROMISE
THAT I WILL HAPPILY PICK UP

07:29.083 --> 07:31.617
THE METAPHORICAL HAMMER
TO SLAM YOU BACK DOWN

07:31.686 --> 07:33.986
AND REMIND YOU THAT
YOU HAVE NOT YET DONE ANYTHING

07:34.055 --> 07:35.454
TO EARN OUR FORGIVENESS.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.156
SO TAKE YOUR MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS AND PAY

07:37.224 --> 07:39.158
A THERAPIST TO CARE
ABOUT HOW TOUGH IT'S BEEN

07:39.226 --> 07:40.392
TO GET CAUGHT BEING AN ABUSER

07:40.461 --> 07:42.061
BECAUSE HONESTLY,
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT,

07:42.129 --> 07:43.862
AND AS FOR MEN LIKE
ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN,

07:43.931 --> 07:45.664
WE REALLY DON'T NEED THEM.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.800
YOU KNOW WHO'S
A BETTER ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.101
WOMEN!

07:49.170 --> 07:51.570
WOMEN TALK TO EACH OTHER,

07:51.639 --> 07:52.738
AND WE TALK
TO JOURNALISTS,

07:52.807 --> 07:54.173
AND WE TALK TO LAWYERS!

07:54.241 --> 07:56.709
IT'S 2017. WE DON'T HAVE TO
PUT UP WITH THIS SHIT.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.111
WE ARE COMING FOR YOU.

07:59.180 --> 08:01.046
TALK TO EVERY WOMAN--

08:01.115 --> 08:02.448
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

08:02.516 --> 08:05.117
TALK TO EVERY WOMAN
YOU WORK WITH

08:05.186 --> 08:08.253
LIKE SHE HAS THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" ON SPEED DIAL.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.122
WELL, I GUESS IT TOOK
THE "TIMES" A LITTLE WHILE

08:10.191 --> 08:11.623
TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.693
OK. TALK TO EVERY WOMAN
LIKE SHE HAS ME ON SPEED DIAL.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.096
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

08:17.164 --> 08:19.131
MY SHOW IS ONLY ONCE A WEEK.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.000
I'VE GOT SOME FREE TIME.

08:21.068 --> 08:24.169
AHH, MEMORIES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

08:24.238 --> 08:26.739
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

08:29.882 --> 08:31.882
HI. THERE. ME AGAIN--
SAMANTHA BEE,

08:31.950 --> 08:34.618
ENJOYING MY LAST FEW WEEKS
OF TELEVISION STARDOM

08:34.687 --> 08:36.787
BEFORE MY SHOW'S REPLACED
WITH "MARIA BUTINA'S

08:36.855 --> 08:38.622
SEXY GUN TIME VARIETY HOUR."

08:38.691 --> 08:41.258
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE IGNORE
SHITTY MEN'S SHITTINESS,

08:41.326 --> 08:44.995
WE DON'T JUST END UP WITH
"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"
MOVIES NO ONE ASKED FOR.

08:45.064 --> 08:48.331
WE ALSO END UP
WITH A LOT OF DAMAGED CAREERS,

08:48.400 --> 08:50.801
WOMEN'S AND--
MORE IMPORTANTLY--MEN'S,

08:50.869 --> 08:52.969
SO I'VE PUT TOGETHER
A BUSINESS COURSE FOR MEN

08:53.038 --> 08:56.073
ON HOW TO NOT EXPOSE
THEIR PENISES

08:56.141 --> 08:58.875
FOR FUN AND PROFIT.

08:58.944 --> 09:02.279
HEY, EVERYONE. WITH ALL THESE
BIG SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES

09:02.348 --> 09:04.281
GOING PUBLIC,
MEN ARE GETTING CONCERNED

09:04.350 --> 09:06.483
ABOUT HOW THEY CAN AVOID
BEING ACCUSED.

09:06.552 --> 09:08.552
SOME HAVE EVEN STOPPED HAVING
SOLO MEETINGS

09:08.620 --> 09:09.920
WITH WOMEN AT ALL,

09:09.988 --> 09:11.755
WHICH IS GREAT
FOR WOMEN'S CAREERS.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.623
THANKS, GUYS.

09:13.692 --> 09:15.726
SO I HAVE SOME BUSINESS ADVICE.

09:15.794 --> 09:19.062
FELLAS, I'M A BIG COMEDY STAR/
HOLLYWOOD EXECUTIVE,

09:19.131 --> 09:20.764
AND I FOUND THAT IT'S
QUITE EASY

09:20.833 --> 09:23.734
NOT TO MASTURBATE
IN FRONT OF MY EMPLOYEES.

09:23.802 --> 09:25.435
IN FACT, IT'S ONE
OF THE EASIEST THINGS

09:25.504 --> 09:27.070
I DON'T DO.

09:27.139 --> 09:28.839
EVERY DAY, I WAKE UP,
GET DRESSED,

09:28.907 --> 09:30.107
TAKE THE SUBWAY TO WORK,

09:30.175 --> 09:34.177
AND THEN DON'T MASTURBATE
IN FRONT OF ANYONE.

09:34.246 --> 09:37.114
NEXT TIME YOU GET
THE URGE TO MASTURBATE,

09:37.182 --> 09:39.483
JUST ASK YOURSELF,
"AM I IN FRONT

09:39.551 --> 09:41.218
OF AN EMPLOYEE
OR A COLLEAGUE?"

09:41.286 --> 09:45.255
AND IF THE ANSWER IS YES,
DON'T, JUST DON'T,

09:45.324 --> 09:47.391
AND ALSO,
WHILE I HAVE YOU HERE,

09:47.459 --> 09:49.793
MEN, I'M SORRY
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,

09:49.862 --> 09:52.596
BUT YOUR DICK IS UGLY.

09:52.664 --> 09:57.100
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE YOUR DICK
IN ANY CONTEXT.

09:57.169 --> 09:59.536
EVEN THE STRAIGHTEST,
HORNIEST WOMAN

09:59.605 --> 10:01.405
WHO LOVES YOU THE MOST

10:01.473 --> 10:02.739
IS HOPING YOU CAN
GET IT INSIDE HER

10:02.808 --> 10:04.441
WITHOUT HER HAVING TO
LOOK AT IT,

10:04.510 --> 10:07.978
SO DEFINITELY DON'T
SHOW IT TO STRANGERS,

10:08.047 --> 10:09.813
DON'T TEXT PICS OF IT
TO PEOPLE,

10:09.882 --> 10:12.182
AND DON'T WHIP IT OUT
AT FILM FESTIVALS.

10:12.251 --> 10:16.219
YOUR DICK IS OBJECTIVELY
THE WORST THING ABOUT YOU.

10:16.288 --> 10:18.689
IF YOU WANT TO SEND
A LADY A PICTURE OF SOMETHING,

10:18.757 --> 10:21.058
TRY YOUR NIPPLE
OR A PINKY TOE

10:21.126 --> 10:23.727
OR A FAVORITE MOLE.

10:23.796 --> 10:25.328
DON'T MASTURBATE
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE

10:25.397 --> 10:27.964
WHO HAVEN'T SPECIFICALLY
ASKED YOU TO,

10:28.033 --> 10:30.200
AND EVEN THEN,
STOP AND ASK YOURSELF,

10:30.269 --> 10:32.502
"WHAT IS OUR POWER DYNAMIC?

10:32.571 --> 10:34.671
"IS THERE A CHANCE IN HELL
THAT THIS PERSON

10:34.740 --> 10:37.374
"MIGHT ONLY BE AGREEING
TO SEE MY HIDEOUS DICK

10:37.443 --> 10:39.476
OUT OF FEAR
FOR THEIR CAREER?"

10:39.545 --> 10:42.346
IF SO, MAKE
A GOOD BUSINESS CHOICE

10:42.414 --> 10:44.614
AND KEEP YOUR BUSINESS
IN YOUR PANTS.

10:44.683 --> 10:46.616
GOOD TALK, GUYS.

10:46.685 --> 10:48.085
YOU KNOW, WHAT, FELLAS?

10:48.153 --> 10:50.687
A LITTLE FREE ADVICE FOR YOU.

10:50.756 --> 10:52.122
NO ONE KNOWS BETTER THAN YOU

10:52.191 --> 10:55.058
HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU'VE
ASSAULTED OR HARASSED.

10:55.127 --> 10:57.627
MAYBE BEFORE YOU PITCH
A TV SHOW ABOUT IT,

10:57.696 --> 11:00.063
ASK YOURSELF "HAVE ALL THE WOMEN

11:00.132 --> 11:03.333
"I'VE NON-CONSENSUALLY SHOWN
MY PENIS TO COME FORWARD

11:03.402 --> 11:05.235
IN THE PRESS?"

11:05.304 --> 11:09.206
IF THE ANSWER IS NO,
GO AWAY.

11:09.274 --> 11:10.874
IF THE ANSWER IS YES,

11:10.943 --> 11:13.010
ALSO GO AWAY.

11:13.078 --> 11:16.046
IF I'VE SAID ANYTHING
THAT APPLIES TO YOU,

11:16.115 --> 11:17.581
JUST [BLEEP] OFF.

11:17.649 --> 11:20.117
CATCH YOU LATER, FELLAS. TCH!

11:20.185 --> 11:23.353
ANYWAY, UM, IN OTHER NEWS--

11:23.422 --> 11:25.188
ACTUALLY,
ONE MORE THING, [BLEEP].

11:25.257 --> 11:27.624
NO ONE SHOULD BE WEARING
A ROBE AT WORK.

11:27.693 --> 11:30.327
CHARLIE ROSE, YOU AND I
BASICALLY DO THE SAME JOB.

11:30.396 --> 11:31.862
I SAY SOME STUFF
ABOUT THE NEWS,

11:31.930 --> 11:34.097
I INTERVIEW PEOPLE,
I SUPERVISE,

11:34.166 --> 11:35.766
AND AT NO POINT,
HAVE I EVER WOKEN UP

11:35.834 --> 11:37.234
IN THE MORNING AND THOUGHT,

11:37.302 --> 11:39.736
"YOU KNOW WHAT I SHOULD WEAR
IN FRONT OF MY EMPLOYEES TODAY?

11:39.805 --> 11:43.006
"A WHISPER OF A GARMENT
THAT A GENTLE BREEZE

11:43.075 --> 11:44.675
COULD RENDER IRRELEVANT."

11:44.743 --> 11:47.210
WEARING CLOTHES AT WORK

11:47.279 --> 11:49.046
IS THE INVISIBLE CONTRACT
WE SIGN

11:49.114 --> 11:52.115
WHEN WE ENTER POLITE
[BLEEP] SOCIETY AS ADULTS.

11:52.184 --> 11:54.017
TOO OFTEN WHEN MEN
ARE AWFUL AT WORK,

11:54.086 --> 11:56.687
WOMEN ARE LEGALLY BARRED
FROM TALKING ABOUT IT.

11:56.755 --> 11:59.089
I SAT DOWN WITH EMPLOYMENT
LAW REFORM ADVOCATE

11:59.158 --> 12:01.992
AND SURVIVOR OF MALE AWFULNESS
GRETCHEN CARLSON

12:02.061 --> 12:03.226
TO FIND OUT WHY.

12:03.295 --> 12:05.162
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

12:05.230 --> 12:07.864
I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY
OF THE DETAILS,
UNFORTUNATELY.

12:07.933 --> 12:09.166
AND THAT'S BECAUSE...

12:09.234 --> 12:11.234
AND THAT'S BECAUSE,
IN SOCIETY, WE'VE CHOSEN

12:11.303 --> 12:14.671
TWO WAYS TO RESOLVE
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES,
AND THEY'RE BOTH SECRET.

12:14.740 --> 12:17.674
ONE IS SETTLEMENTS,
WHERE THE WOMEN CAN NEVER
TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED...

12:17.743 --> 12:20.177
MM-HMM.
AND THE OTHER IS
FORCED ARBITRATION,

12:20.245 --> 12:21.678
WHICH IS ALSO
A SECRET CHAMBER,

12:21.747 --> 12:23.613
SO WOMEN CAN NEVER
TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

12:23.682 --> 12:28.885
SO THE FIRST RULE OF FORCED
ARBITRATION IS "DON'T TALK
ABOUT FORCED ARBITRATION."

12:28.954 --> 12:30.854
BUT I CAN SAY
HYPOTHETICALLY,

12:30.923 --> 12:33.223
IF A WOMAN'S BEING
SEXUALLY HARASSED
IN A WORKPLACE

12:33.292 --> 12:35.425
AND SHE HAS AN
ARBITRATION CLAUSE,
SHE'S SCREWED

12:35.494 --> 12:37.694
BECAUSE, SEE, WE'VE BEEN
FOOLING OUR CULTURE
INTO THINKING

12:37.763 --> 12:40.130
WE HAD SOLVED
THIS PROBLEM
SINCE ANITA HILL

12:40.199 --> 12:43.133
BECAUSE WE DON'T HEAR
ABOUT THESE STORIES.

12:43.202 --> 12:45.435
MM-HMM.
BUT THE REASON
WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT

12:45.504 --> 12:49.873
THESE STORIES IS BECAUSE
THEY'RE GOING TO ONE
OF TWO SECRET CHAMBERS.

12:49.942 --> 12:51.808
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
THE DETAILS OF YOUR STORY,

12:51.877 --> 12:55.445
BUT I'M GOING TO REACT
AS THOUGH YOU'RE
TELLING ME YOUR STORY

12:55.514 --> 12:57.948
BASED ON WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT ROGER AILES.
OK.

12:58.017 --> 12:59.950
OH. OH.

13:00.019 --> 13:01.952
UGH. THAT'S GROSS.

13:02.021 --> 13:05.055
[INHALES DEEPLY]
OH, MY GOD!

13:05.124 --> 13:07.791
AAH!

13:07.860 --> 13:10.794
AWFUL! ERRRR!

13:10.863 --> 13:12.929
AAH!

13:12.998 --> 13:15.465
THAT'S DISGUSTING!

13:15.534 --> 13:18.969
OH, I FEEL
SO HORRIBLE!

13:19.038 --> 13:21.138
[RASPY MOAN]
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT?

13:21.206 --> 13:23.140
HA HA HA HA!

13:23.208 --> 13:25.242
AFTER I AIRED THIS INTERVIEW
BACK IN JANUARY,

13:25.310 --> 13:27.177
I TOOK THE FORCED
ARBITRATION CLAUSES

13:27.246 --> 13:28.378
OUT OF MY STAFF'S CONTRACTS,

13:28.447 --> 13:30.247
AND I'M NOT EVEN
THAT GREAT A BOSS.

13:30.315 --> 13:32.382
I CALL EVERY SINGLE
STAFFER KEVIN,

13:32.451 --> 13:34.451
BUT AT LEAST NOW,
ALL THE KEVINS

13:34.520 --> 13:35.485
CAN SUE ME FOR IT.

13:35.554 --> 13:36.620
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:36.689 --> 13:38.055
GREAT JOB, KEVINS.

13:39.666 --> 13:41.032
WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.601
WHEN I FIND MYSELF FRUSTRATED
WITH THE STATE OF THE WORLD,

13:43.636 --> 13:46.604
I LIKE TO REWATCH ONE OF MY
FAVORITE INTERVIEWS OF ALL TIME,

13:46.806 --> 13:50.574
THE ONE WHERE ELIZABETH WARREN
TOLD ME TO STOP WHINING.

13:50.643 --> 13:52.476
DONALD TRUMP: THEY HAVE
PHONY WITCH HUNTS...

13:52.478 --> 13:54.578
OH, GOD.
GOING AGAINST ME.

13:54.647 --> 13:56.414
THEY HAVE
EVERYTHING GOING.
THIS SPEECH.

13:56.482 --> 13:58.616
BEE, VOICE-OVER: THAT'S IT!
NO MORE BUNKER FUNK.

13:58.685 --> 14:01.886
I NEED ANSWERS, REAL ANSWERS.
STAY FOCUSED.

14:01.954 --> 14:04.588
OH, MY GOD, NO.

14:04.657 --> 14:06.057
OHH...

14:06.125 --> 14:08.192
NO TIME FOR PUPPIES.

14:08.261 --> 14:11.595
BEE, VOICE-OVER:
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO TO TALK TO.

14:11.664 --> 14:15.966
I JUST...GOT TO...
GET...TO...HER.

14:16.035 --> 14:17.802
EH...

14:17.870 --> 14:19.470
BEE, VOICE-OVER: DAMN IT.

14:19.539 --> 14:21.038
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

14:21.107 --> 14:23.941
METAPHOR TIME.

14:29.182 --> 14:31.449
OW!

14:31.517 --> 14:33.584
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

14:33.653 --> 14:34.952
SAM?
YEAH?

14:35.021 --> 14:36.687
YOU HAVE GLASS
IN YOUR HAIR.

14:36.756 --> 14:38.155
OH.

14:38.224 --> 14:40.124
OOH.

14:40.193 --> 14:42.126
OH, THAT'S BETTER.
GOOD.

14:42.195 --> 14:43.361
THANK YOU. OK.
YOU BET.

14:43.429 --> 14:44.462
PEOPLE COME UP TO ME
ALL THE TIME,

14:44.530 --> 14:45.496
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"WHAT DO I DO?

14:45.565 --> 14:46.964
WHAT DO I DO?
HELP ME,"

14:47.033 --> 14:49.066
SO MY QUESTION
TO YOU IS,

14:49.135 --> 14:51.369
WHAT SHOULD
I TELL THEM?

14:51.437 --> 14:53.437
YOU GET
IN THE FIGHT,

14:53.506 --> 14:54.972
AND THEN YOU FIGHT
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.040
BUT WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

14:56.109 --> 14:57.975
OH, COME ON. YOU
KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

14:58.044 --> 14:59.143
DO I?

14:59.212 --> 15:00.411
IT MEANS THAT WHEN
YOU'RE TOLD TO BE QUIET,

15:00.480 --> 15:02.613
YOU DON'T SIT DOWN
AND BE QUIET.

15:02.682 --> 15:04.081
YOU STAND BACK UP.

15:04.150 --> 15:06.017
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
SO ENTHUSIASTIC...

15:06.085 --> 15:07.184
I AM.
AND I FEEL LIKE

15:07.253 --> 15:09.086
YOU THINK THAT WE'RE
GONNA COME OUT OF THIS

15:09.155 --> 15:11.689
BETTER THAN
WHEN WE STARTED.

15:11.758 --> 15:13.591
YES.
WHAT?

15:13.660 --> 15:14.992
YEAH, AND
YOU KNOW WHY?

15:15.061 --> 15:16.127
TELL ME.

15:16.195 --> 15:17.395
BECAUSE WE DON'T
HAVE ANY CHOICE.

15:17.463 --> 15:19.430
OK. YOU'VE SPENT
YOUR WHOLE LIFE

15:19.499 --> 15:20.698
FIGHTING FOR
THE WORKING CLASS,

15:20.767 --> 15:22.667
AND THE GUY WHO
WANTS TO DISMANTLE...

15:22.735 --> 15:24.435
YEAH.
ECONOMIC PROTECTIONS

15:24.504 --> 15:26.270
FOR THOSE PEOPLE
ACTUALLY WON.

15:26.339 --> 15:28.072
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:28.141 --> 15:29.740
[BEEP] THOSE PEOPLE"?

15:29.809 --> 15:32.043
NO. NEVER.

15:32.111 --> 15:35.012
THIS IS WHO I AM.
THIS IS MY FAMILY.

15:35.081 --> 15:37.715
THIS IS HOW I GREW UP,
AND, YEAH, DONALD TRUMP

15:37.784 --> 15:39.750
LIED TO THEM,
LIED TO THEIR FACES,

15:39.819 --> 15:42.620
BUT THE ANSWER IS,
THEN POINT IT OUT,

15:42.689 --> 15:44.555
HOLD HIM
ACCOUNTABLE,

15:44.624 --> 15:46.257
AND OFFER THEM
SOMETHING BETTER.

15:46.325 --> 15:48.025
OK.

15:48.094 --> 15:50.061
YOU GOT A LOT
OF POLITICAL CAPITAL

15:50.129 --> 15:52.330
OUT OF MITCH McCONNELL
TELLING YOU TO BE QUIET.

15:52.398 --> 15:54.231
YEAH.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.200
WHO ELSE CAN YOU
SCORE POINTS OFF OF

15:56.269 --> 15:57.601
FOR BEING RUDE
TO YOU?

15:57.670 --> 16:01.038
LIKE, HOW CAN I TURN
"UNFUNNY, FEMINIST BATTLE-AX"

16:01.107 --> 16:03.240
INTO A COOL MEME
FOR MYSELF?

16:03.309 --> 16:05.710
HEY, BEST REVENGE--
MM-HMM?

16:05.778 --> 16:07.111
JUST ENJOY IT.

16:07.180 --> 16:08.279
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

16:08.348 --> 16:09.880
"WANNABE
DANIEL TOSH."

16:09.949 --> 16:11.716
OH, ACTUALLY, THAT
IS A LITTLE LOW.

16:11.784 --> 16:12.850
OK. KEEP GOING.

16:12.919 --> 16:15.052
"CANADIAN
LUNCH LADY ARMS."

16:15.121 --> 16:17.888
WELL, TAKE THAT
IN A GOOD WAY.

16:17.957 --> 16:19.657
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MRS. SUNSHINE?

16:19.726 --> 16:21.759
INTERPRET "CANADIAN
LUNCH LADY ARMS"

16:21.828 --> 16:24.261
IN A POSITIVE MANNER
FOR ME.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.130
STRONG
AND NOURISHING.

16:26.199 --> 16:28.099
SHUT THE FRONT DOOR.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.834
MY CYNICISM IS NOT
BACKING DOWN

16:29.902 --> 16:31.235
FROM YOUR BLIND
OPTIMISM.

16:31.304 --> 16:33.637
MY OPTIMISM
IS NOT BLIND.
OH, GOD.

16:33.706 --> 16:36.240
I SEE EXACTLY
WHAT'S GOING ON.

16:36.309 --> 16:37.608
LET'S TRY SOMETHING.
OK.

16:37.677 --> 16:39.143
LET'S SAY
I'M ON THE LEDGE

16:39.212 --> 16:40.845
OF THE DEATH
OF DEMOCRACY

16:40.913 --> 16:42.380
AND I HAVE
ONE PHONE CALL.

16:42.448 --> 16:44.949
I'M GONNA CALL YOU.
MM-HMM.

16:45.018 --> 16:47.118
HI, SENATOR WARREN.
THIS IS SAMANTHA BEE.

16:47.186 --> 16:48.386
HI, SAMANTHA.

16:48.454 --> 16:50.054
I'M JUST ON THE LEDGE
OF THE DEATH OF DEMOCRACY.

16:50.123 --> 16:52.356
I WAS JUST WONDERING,
CAN YOU TALK ME OFF OF IT?

16:52.425 --> 16:55.259
YEAH. SAMANTHA...
UH-HUH?

16:55.328 --> 16:57.028
YOU'RE STRONG.
SORRY.

16:57.096 --> 16:58.262
YOU'RE BREAKING UP.
COME ON.

16:58.331 --> 16:59.330
YOU'RE STRONG.

16:59.399 --> 17:00.631
IS THAT
YOUR CALL WAITING?

17:00.700 --> 17:02.700
WHEN WE PUT OUR
VOICES TOGETHER--

17:02.769 --> 17:04.635
HELLO?
SAMANTHA...

17:04.704 --> 17:05.770
HELLO?

17:05.838 --> 17:07.004
YOU HANG ON
TO THAT PHONE.

17:07.073 --> 17:08.239
DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT.
I'VE PLAYED THAT GAME.

17:08.307 --> 17:09.907
YOU HOLD ON
TO THAT PHONE.

17:09.976 --> 17:11.709
SORRY, CAN I PUT YOU
ON HOLD FOR ONE SEC?

17:11.778 --> 17:13.844
NO. I'M STILL HERE.

17:13.913 --> 17:18.149
HEY, HI, BEYONCE.
HOW ARE YOUR TWINS?

17:18.217 --> 17:21.052
OH, MY GOD,
SEND ME SOME PHOTOS.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.787
I'M JUST ON THE PHONE
WITH ELIZABETH WARREN.

17:22.855 --> 17:24.889
IT'S AMAZING.
SHE'S SO GOOD.

17:24.957 --> 17:27.124
OH, I KNOW.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

17:27.193 --> 17:29.393
KISS THE BABIES.
KISS THOSE BABIES.

17:29.462 --> 17:31.195
YOU KISS THOSE LITTLE
BEYONCE BABIES.

17:31.264 --> 17:34.298
OK. OK. OK. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.767
HELLO?
HELLO.

17:36.836 --> 17:38.469
IS THAT BEYONCE?
NO.

17:38.538 --> 17:39.670
OK.
OK.

17:39.739 --> 17:40.771
LET'S GET DOWN
TO BRASS TACKS.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.039
ARE YOU RUNNING,
OR ARE YOU NOT?

17:42.108 --> 17:43.274
I'M NOT.

17:43.343 --> 17:44.275
YOU GONNA BE PART
OF THE HOT 70 OVER 70?

17:44.344 --> 17:45.276
I AM RUNNING.

17:45.345 --> 17:46.977
I'M RUNNING IN 2018
OK.

17:47.046 --> 17:48.746
FOR SENATE
FROM MASSACHUSETTS.

17:48.815 --> 17:50.414
BECAUSE THE SHIT
IS BROKEN.

17:50.483 --> 17:52.350
WE NEED YOU TO FIX IT.

17:52.418 --> 17:54.251
BEE, VOICE-OVER:
AND ONE LAST QUESTION

17:54.320 --> 17:55.753
BEFORE THE END TIMES COME.

17:55.822 --> 17:57.121
AFTER A HARD DAY
AT MY JOB,

17:57.190 --> 17:59.423
I LIKE TO GO HOME,
BITE DOWN

17:59.492 --> 18:02.293
ON A ROLLED-UP TOWEL,
AND SCREAM.

18:02.362 --> 18:04.762
MM-HMM.
HOW DO YOU RELAX?

18:04.831 --> 18:06.330
LIKE TO WATCH
A LITTLE TV--

18:06.399 --> 18:07.898
OK.
"BALLERS."

18:07.967 --> 18:09.367
"BALLERS."

18:09.435 --> 18:11.769
IT'S ACTUALLY
A STORY ABOUT--

18:11.838 --> 18:12.870
ABOUT HARD WORK.

18:12.939 --> 18:14.205
IT'S A STORY ABOUT
PERSEVERANCE.

18:14.273 --> 18:15.940
IT'S A STORY ABOUT

18:16.009 --> 18:17.241
HAVING TO REACH
WITHIN YOURSELF

18:17.310 --> 18:18.476
AND FIND SOMETHING
THAT YOU'RE NOT

18:18.544 --> 18:20.778
100% SURE IS THERE.

18:20.847 --> 18:22.747
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT "BALLERS."

18:22.815 --> 18:24.315
YOU BET.

18:24.384 --> 18:27.018
THAT'S SO INTERESTING
THAT YOU SAY THAT.

18:27.086 --> 18:28.352
YES.
UM...

18:28.421 --> 18:30.788
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE
HERE WITHOUT A GIFT.

18:30.857 --> 18:33.157
BEE, VOICE-OVER: THAT'S WHEN I
GAVE HER THE SECOND MOST JACKED

18:33.226 --> 18:35.993
STAR OF "BALLERS"--
MY FRIEND ROB CORDDRY

18:36.062 --> 18:39.997
AND DISCOVERED SHE'S GOT A
MASSIVE CRUSH ON DWAYNE JOHNSON.

18:40.066 --> 18:45.803
AFTER 6 MONTHS OF LIVING HELL,
I WITNESSED PURE HAPPINESS.

18:45.872 --> 18:47.872
THEY'RE GONNA WRAP ME UP
IN SOME NICE GIFT WRAPPING,

18:47.940 --> 18:49.206
AND I'LL BE
BY THE FRONT DOOR,

18:49.275 --> 18:50.274
GREAT.
DWAYNE AND I.

18:50.343 --> 18:51.442
OK. GOOD.
COME ON.

18:51.511 --> 18:52.977
PUT A SHIRT ON, BUDDY.
LET'S GO.

18:53.046 --> 18:55.813
MAKE SURE I POKE AN AIR
HOLE IN YOUR WRAPPING.

18:55.882 --> 18:57.381
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.

18:57.450 --> 18:58.883
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I WAS ACTUALLY

18:58.951 --> 19:00.785
VERY NERVOUS
ABOUT THIS,

19:00.853 --> 19:02.787
BUT I THINK
IT WENT QUITE WELL.

19:02.855 --> 19:05.423
NEVERTHELESS,
YOU PERSISTED.

19:05.491 --> 19:07.858
OH!

19:07.927 --> 19:09.393
YOU DID IT.
I DID.

19:09.462 --> 19:11.429
HEYYYY!

19:11.497 --> 19:13.464
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

19:13.466 --> 19:14.665
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

19:16.002 --> 19:18.235
HONESTLY, THIS YEAR SHOWS
JUST HOW POWERFUL

19:18.271 --> 19:19.970
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT REALLY IS.

19:20.039 --> 19:22.740
IT'S GIVEN SOME WOMEN HOPE
AND GIVEN OTHERS A VOICE.

19:22.809 --> 19:24.842
IT'S ALSO SPARED US
FROM HAVING TO ENDURE

19:24.911 --> 19:28.012
ONE MORE EPISODE OF A SHOW
STARRING JEREMY PIVEN.

19:28.081 --> 19:31.349
STILL, THIS MESSAGE
WE DELIVERED MANY MONTHS AGO

19:31.417 --> 19:33.851
IS AS RELEVANT TODAY
AS IT WAS THEN.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.653
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ASK ME
ALL THE TIME

19:35.722 --> 19:38.122
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
A WOMAN IN COMEDY.

19:38.191 --> 19:40.157
WELL, HERE'S WHAT IT'S
BEEN LIKE FOR ME

19:40.226 --> 19:41.826
AND A LOT OF THE WOMEN I KNOW.

19:41.894 --> 19:44.929
YOU KNOW, EVEN IF NO ONE
EXPOSES HIS PENIS TO YOU,

19:44.998 --> 19:48.766
YOU'RE STILL DEALING
WITH A PARADE OF TOTAL DICKS,

19:48.835 --> 19:51.369
LIKE, LADY-BLIND PIECES OF CRAP

19:51.437 --> 19:52.770
WHO INTERRUPT YOU
IN EVERY MEETING

19:52.839 --> 19:56.307
AND WHEN YOU GET TO TALK
FORGET TO WRITE YOUR JOKES DOWN,

19:56.376 --> 19:58.576
SENTIENT HOODIES WHO CAN
WATCH YOU KILL ONSTAGE

19:58.644 --> 20:00.745
AND THEN AFTERWARDS GO
"I JUST DIDN'T GET IT,"

20:00.813 --> 20:02.146
THEN WALK AWAY
AND FIST BUMP

20:02.215 --> 20:05.349
THE 11th GUY WHO DID A TIGHT 5
ON THE [BLEEP] FRIENDZONE,

20:05.418 --> 20:08.953
AND ALL OF THESE
OTHER SPECIES OF COMEDY PENIS.

20:09.022 --> 20:14.358
SO, GATEKEEPERS OF COMEDY,
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

20:14.427 --> 20:17.595
WHY ALL THE WOMEN ARE
SO PISSED OFF, THAT'S WHY,

20:17.664 --> 20:19.397
AND IF YOU STILL
DON'T GET IT,

20:19.465 --> 20:22.900
I INVITE YOU TO GO AWAY.

20:22.969 --> 20:25.436
YOU ARE WRONG
ABOUT WHERE THE CLITORIS IS,

20:25.505 --> 20:27.972
AND YOU'RE WRONG
ABOUT WHAT MAKES GOOD COMEDY.

20:28.041 --> 20:30.908
LADIES, YOUR JOKES
ABOUT "GILMORE GIRLS"

20:30.977 --> 20:32.443
AND YEAST INFECTIONS
AND WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

20:32.512 --> 20:35.212
TO BE ANGRY
ALL THE [BLEEP] TIME ARE GREAT!

20:35.281 --> 20:40.451
THE METEOR HAS ALREADY HIT,
SO DON'T WORRY

20:40.520 --> 20:42.420
ABOUT WHAT THE DINOSAURS THINK.

20:42.488 --> 20:44.955
THE FUTURE OF COMEDY IS YOURS

20:45.024 --> 20:46.891
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
THERE'S A WOMAN

20:46.959 --> 20:49.060
WHO WORKS AT A BANK
WHO GOT A DICK FLASHED AT HER

20:49.128 --> 20:50.995
IN A METING SHE WASN'T
ALLOWED TO TALK IN,

20:51.064 --> 20:52.530
AND WHEN SHE GETS
OFF WORK TONIGHT,

20:52.598 --> 20:54.231
SHE WANTS YOU TO MAKE
HER LAUGH ABOUT IT,

20:54.300 --> 20:57.034
SO BURN IT DOWN,
MY WITCHES.

20:57.103 --> 20:58.602
THANK YOU,
AND GOOD NIGHT.

20:58.671 --> 21:01.172
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
