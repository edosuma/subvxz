Who do you think it is?

18:32.241 --> 18:34.344

18:34.413 --> 18:36.206

in the bedroom.

18:38.310 --> 18:39.862
- Oh, my gosh. I want you
to come see this place.

18:39.931 --> 18:41.241
This place is sick.
We're in like Athens.

18:41.310 --> 18:43.275
We're, like,
right on this pond.

18:43.344 --> 18:47.000
We got, like, a boat set up and
a super sick pool and

18:47.068 --> 18:48.310
I want my sister here.

18:48.379 --> 18:52.241
<i>- Oh, I'm coming.
- All right, sweet.</i>

18:52.310 --> 18:54.275
- Mm-hmm, I know.

18:54.344 --> 18:56.689
I heard Gus
inviting his sister,

18:56.758 --> 19:00.379
the same sister that called
and threatened to beat my ass.

19:00.448 --> 19:02.137

Well, hopefully,
she brings that

19:08.241 --> 19:09.724

because I want it.

19:09.793 --> 19:11.586

19:11.655 --> 19:13.862
You're going to have
to leave that day.

19:13.931 --> 19:15.827
There's going to be
some bull

19:15.896 --> 19:18.275

All right.

19:38.931 --> 19:40.862

back safely on that boat.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.482

19:42.551 --> 19:43.862
Bless this meal.

19:43.931 --> 19:45.172
Good food,

19:45.241 --> 19:46.482
Good meat, good God,
let's eat.

19:46.551 --> 19:47.793
Amen.

19:47.862 --> 19:49.310
- And thank you
for Ravioli being okay.

19:49.379 --> 19:51.413
- Oh, yes.
I forgot about Ravioli.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.896
- How's the goats
after the mayhem last--

19:53.965 --> 19:55.379
- Yeah, what the hell?

19:55.448 --> 19:57.000
I saw you guys, but I thought
you were building a ramp,

19:57.068 --> 19:58.586
because y'all had
the cornhole board

19:58.655 --> 20:00.068
and he had had a helmet on.

20:00.137 --> 20:02.137

Lord and the spirit

20:02.206 --> 20:03.931
that knew y'all was doing
some bull

20:04.000 --> 20:05.517
- I turned that corner,
and I see Candace

20:05.586 --> 20:06.517
was making eye contact with me;
I was like...

20:06.586 --> 20:07.586
- What are y'all doing?

20:07.655 --> 20:10.137
Ahh!
-

20:10.206 --> 20:12.103
- Candace sleeps with
one eye open.

20:12.172 --> 20:14.000
- I do. I don't trust nobody.
I don't trust nobody.

20:14.068 --> 20:15.551
- The fact that all of
the roommates are sitting here

20:15.620 --> 20:17.137
<i>laughing about the prank
that was pulled,</i>

20:17.206 --> 20:18.413
<i>it definitely shows growth.</i>

20:18.482 --> 20:19.724
Because if you look
at our track record

20:19.793 --> 20:21.379
and the pranks done
in this house,

20:21.448 --> 20:24.034
there's always somebody that's
offended and is ready to fight.

20:24.103 --> 20:26.310
- Not only is my toothpaste
missing,

20:26.379 --> 20:28.689
I stepped in it,
because look at this.

20:28.758 --> 20:30.068
- gonna buy me

20:30.137 --> 20:31.965

another tube of toothpaste.

20:32.034 --> 20:34.517
- I'm not buying
- Bet the you will.

20:34.586 --> 20:36.137
- Bet I won't.
- Bet the you--

20:36.206 --> 20:37.724
- Skrrt.
- Bitch.

20:37.793 --> 20:40.000
- We've grown tremendously.
- Just don't do that to me,

20:40.068 --> 20:42.206
because I can't move
that quick these days.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.310

20:43.379 --> 20:45.206

20:45.275 --> 20:46.413
- Anything to get out

20:46.482 --> 20:47.344
- Anything to get out
of the house.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.068
- Anything that has food.

20:49.137 --> 20:52.103

- I can try to bowl.

20:52.172 --> 20:53.862
- You can do this too.
You can bowl, right?

20:53.931 --> 20:56.206
- I'll do it either way.
- Yeah, you got him walking.

20:56.275 --> 20:59.034
- Knowing him, he'll drop a
bowling ball on hisself, watch.

20:59.103 --> 21:00.551
Calling that right now.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.206

21:18.103 --> 21:21.827

21:21.896 --> 21:24.517
When bad things
are going on at home,

21:24.586 --> 21:27.379
<i>it makes it really hard
to enjoy a vacation</i>

21:27.448 --> 21:29.724
because you're
so consumed with,

21:29.793 --> 21:31.517
"Is this person okay
back home?"

21:31.586 --> 21:34.482
- I know. It's not fun.
It's rough.

21:34.551 --> 21:36.103
I don't mean to laugh;
it's just I'm only laughing

21:36.172 --> 21:37.517
just because
I know how bad it is.

21:37.586 --> 21:39.827
When you have that much stress
going on back home

21:39.896 --> 21:41.620
and just like go
in a spiral in your head

21:41.689 --> 21:42.896
and it's so hard
to get out of it.

21:42.965 --> 21:44.068
Like, it just puts you
in a funk.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.827
- Yeah, it really is.
- It's terrible.

21:45.896 --> 21:47.275
Aimee's kind of
going through it right now,

21:47.344 --> 21:49.103
and, like, if anybody
understands "going through it"

21:49.172 --> 21:50.965
while you're in this beach
house, it's definitely me.

21:51.034 --> 21:53.310
- You good for that.
You got people around you

21:53.379 --> 21:55.862
that love you, for real.
It ain't right.

21:55.931 --> 21:59.896
- Thank you, guys.
She had an affair.

21:59.965 --> 22:02.482
And I walked in
on her having an affair.

22:02.551 --> 22:03.862
It just really struck
a chord in me

22:03.931 --> 22:06.034
with my abandonment issues.

22:06.103 --> 22:10.000
It recut wounds that I had,
you know, from my own father.

22:10.068 --> 22:12.068
<i>I understand what it's like
to come in here</i>

22:12.137 --> 22:14.310
and not necessarily be
in the clearest mind

22:14.379 --> 22:15.620
and, like, have stuff
going back home

22:15.689 --> 22:17.103
that puts you
in a depressed state.

22:17.172 --> 22:19.000
Honestly, like, you know,
I've hung out with you

22:19.068 --> 22:20.379
and doing a lot;
I think you guys

22:20.448 --> 22:22.103
are meant for each other,
and the thing is, like,

22:22.172 --> 22:23.620
there's
not one relationship out there

22:23.689 --> 22:25.551
that's

22:25.620 --> 22:27.275
that goes on
behind closed doors.

22:27.344 --> 22:29.275
I hate the fact that Aimee has
to go through that right now,

22:29.344 --> 22:31.620
but if we can just kind of
rally behind her and show her

22:31.689 --> 22:33.758
that even though you're going
through a bad spot right now,

22:33.827 --> 22:35.689
you might have some freak outs,
you might lash out.

22:35.758 --> 22:38.206
- You think I want to tell
the world my boyfriend

22:38.275 --> 22:41.862
is a drug addict?
Here you go; I'm done.

22:41.931 --> 22:45.034
I am hurting
really bad.

22:45.103 --> 22:46.275
- We still love you
at the end of the day.

22:46.344 --> 22:47.793
And hopefully,
that can, like, ultimately

22:47.862 --> 22:49.413
just lift her spirits up.

22:49.482 --> 22:51.137
So anytime you want to talk
about it, just pull me aside.

22:51.206 --> 22:52.448
because if anybody can relate
to this [bleep],

22:52.517 --> 22:54.034
you know it's me.

22:54.103 --> 22:55.758
Like, I've done been through
the wringer with this [bleep],

22:55.827 --> 22:58.034
but I came out on the back
side, like, I'm doing better.

22:58.103 --> 22:59.586
I think that's been
a big reason why my mood

22:59.655 --> 23:01.103
has been a little bit
different here, honestly.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.103
- Yeah, you've been chill.
- I've been a lot more chill

23:03.172 --> 23:05.482
than what I usually am.
I'm not as worked up

23:05.551 --> 23:06.896
and stressed, and I actually
feel like I actually got

23:06.965 --> 23:09.896
somebody that cares about me
a little bit, so...

26:25.068 --> 26:26.448
- You're going
to have so much fun!

26:26.517 --> 26:29.655
This bowling place is huge.
They have bumper cars,

26:29.724 --> 26:33.896
they have bowling, they have
arcade games, they have food.

26:33.965 --> 26:35.931
It's like the total
setup in here.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.689
- Oh, look at all
the games they got.

26:37.758 --> 26:39.275
- This place lit, though.

26:39.344 --> 26:41.517
- Yeah, let's find
the bowling alley first.

26:41.586 --> 26:44.793
- Ravioli, wait, you got
to put your bowling shoes on.

26:44.862 --> 26:47.068
- Gus, you only have
to put on one shoe.

26:47.137 --> 26:49.620
- Only one, baby.
I get to bowl for half price.

26:49.689 --> 26:52.206
Well, Nilsa,
since I have one foot

26:52.275 --> 26:53.620
and you can't necessarily bowl

26:53.689 --> 26:55.000
up to your normal speed
as well,

26:55.068 --> 26:56.931
what do you say we have
some kind of bet on this?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.034
- Yeah, I'm down.
- How about loser

26:59.103 --> 27:02.000
has to cook the other
one breakfast tomorrow?

27:02.068 --> 27:03.137
- Oh,

27:03.206 --> 27:04.965
- But you just
don't have a foot.

27:05.034 --> 27:07.241
I've got a big bowling ball
sitting inside of me.

27:07.310 --> 27:08.896
- You want us to roll you
down the lane?

27:08.965 --> 27:10.517
- you, bitch!

27:10.586 --> 27:11.827
<i>I'm not going to let Gus win.</i>

27:11.896 --> 27:13.413
There's no way
he's going to win.

27:13.482 --> 27:16.413
I'm going to show these people
that just because I'm pregnant

27:16.482 --> 27:19.206
doesn't mean I can't do
what everyone else can do.

27:21.793 --> 27:23.482
- Ah-ahh-ahh!

27:23.551 --> 27:27.724
- Oh, you suck.
All right, let big mama try.

27:27.793 --> 27:31.689
- Oh, [bleep], okay,
that might've been a strike.

27:31.758 --> 27:33.275
Whoo!

27:33.344 --> 27:36.965
- So I like my eggs scrambled
with cheese, orange juice.

27:37.034 --> 27:39.896
- All right, Gus,
let's see how this works.

27:39.965 --> 27:40.965
- I bet even with one--

27:41.034 --> 27:42.241
- Don't drop it on the toe.

27:42.310 --> 27:44.206
- Ahh!
- That's all you, bro.

27:48.724 --> 27:52.862
- Oh, God. Oh,

27:52.931 --> 27:54.965
- Yeah, Gus, you might want
to just work

27:55.034 --> 27:56.448
on what you're going
to cook for breakfast.

27:56.517 --> 27:59.206

Let's go,

28:23.724 --> 28:26.413
- Woo!
- Yeah!

28:26.482 --> 28:28.689
- Oh, what's this about
being pregnant

28:28.758 --> 28:30.034
and not being able to bowl?

28:30.103 --> 28:31.413
- Hey, hey!
- Come on, bitch.

28:31.482 --> 28:33.068
Who got the first strike
of the day?

28:33.137 --> 28:35.137
Me.
How's it feel to get out-bowled

28:35.206 --> 28:37.965
by a 30-week
pregnant woman?

28:38.034 --> 28:40.620
<i>- Right now,
Nilsa's already beating us.</i>

28:40.689 --> 28:43.482
And I'm like, guys,
we cannot let a pregnant lady

28:43.551 --> 28:45.482
beat us, all right?
Get your game up.

28:45.551 --> 28:48.551
- Am I winning? Am I really
winning out of everyone?

28:48.620 --> 28:50.068
- You are!
- Yeah.

28:50.137 --> 28:52.206
- Yeah, it looks like Nilsa's
going to win this comp.

28:52.275 --> 28:56.620
It's still early, my friends.
- Okay.

28:56.689 --> 28:59.482
- Owie, my toe hurts!
- Damn.

28:59.551 --> 29:01.482
- Oh, wow, Gus really sucks.

29:01.551 --> 29:03.206
- you try to bowl
on one foot!

29:03.275 --> 29:07.827
- He bowled a zero.

29:10.965 --> 29:12.103
<i>- ♪ I do what I want,

29:12.172 --> 29:16.482

go, Nilsa!

29:16.551 --> 29:18.931
Let's go, Nilsa.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.931
- Woo!
- Yeah!

29:22.000 --> 29:24.034
- I'm winning? Am I really

29:24.103 --> 29:25.379
- You are!

29:25.448 --> 29:27.137
- Owie, my toe hurts!

29:27.206 --> 29:30.103
- Damn!
Oh, wow. Gus really sucks.

29:30.172 --> 29:32.241
- you try
to bowl on one foot!

29:33.655 --> 29:34.862
- You know, the pregnant lady
is starting off

29:34.931 --> 29:37.137
this bowling alley
by winning, of course.

29:37.206 --> 29:38.655
<i>But I can't, like, smoke her
off the jump.</i>

29:38.724 --> 29:40.275
That's not going to do anything
but hurt her feelings.

29:40.344 --> 29:42.551
I got to at least make her
think she's got a chance here.

29:42.620 --> 29:45.103
- Come on, Gus.
- No!

29:45.172 --> 29:48.517
- That's it! Get in there!
- Oh!

29:48.586 --> 29:50.241
- whore.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.448
- All right, peeps,
it all comes down to this.

29:52.517 --> 29:53.931
- All right, Gus.

29:54.000 --> 29:54.827
- Gus, it doesn't come down
to anything. You lost.

29:54.896 --> 29:56.965
- All right, 46 to 46.

29:57.034 --> 29:59.206
- Don't just throw the ball
angrily at the--

29:59.275 --> 30:00.551
- Candace, shut up!

30:00.620 --> 30:02.793
- Gus, come on.
For the boys now.

30:02.862 --> 30:04.689
For the boys.

30:04.758 --> 30:06.862
- Aww.
Aw, you,

30:06.931 --> 30:10.310
you stupid whore!
- Hey! Ahh!

30:14.103 --> 30:17.241
And of course Gussy boy wins
the competition versus Nilsa.

30:17.310 --> 30:19.275
Ladies, if y'all would like
to join in with Nilsa

30:19.344 --> 30:21.206
to help cook my breakfast
to help a pregnant lady,

30:21.275 --> 30:22.413
I would like eggs Benedict.

30:22.482 --> 30:24.103
- I don't want to help.
- Eggs Benedict?

30:24.172 --> 30:25.724
- What? I don't know
how to make that!

30:25.793 --> 30:27.241
I'm not cooking him breakfast.

30:27.310 --> 30:29.275
- Let's chug now. Cheers.

30:29.344 --> 30:32.758
- Cheers.

30:32.827 --> 30:35.172
- Hold on!
- Oh, no way!

30:35.241 --> 30:37.379
- Hold on!
- Oh! I don't want to die!

30:37.448 --> 30:39.034
I don't want to die!
- Kick they're ass!

30:39.103 --> 30:42.586
- Oh, I'm gonna beat you!
- No, you're not, you're not!

30:42.655 --> 30:44.517
- Yes!

30:44.586 --> 30:45.724
- Oh, man.

30:45.793 --> 30:48.068
- Whoo!
- Is this virtual reality?

30:48.137 --> 30:50.310
Oh, I'm doing it.
- I've never done this before.

30:50.379 --> 30:52.482
What do you do?
Yeah, this is kind of weird.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.275
- Oh, [bleep]! Ahh!
- [Bleep], ahh! Ahh!

30:59.586 --> 31:03.482
- Woo! Got the ball!

31:03.551 --> 31:05.586
<i>I am one

31:05.655 --> 31:09.551
because you don't see anyone
else going home with a prize.

31:16.620 --> 31:21.517

I'm done with this thing.

31:21.586 --> 31:25.482
- So last night I had
a great talk with Gus-Gus.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.827
- You did?

31:26.896 --> 31:28.103
- Yeah. I feel where
he's coming from now.

31:28.172 --> 31:29.413
- Like, what happened?

31:29.482 --> 31:31.068
- I feel a lot
like he did last year,

31:31.137 --> 31:35.413
because he was, like, going
through some [bleep], you know?

31:35.482 --> 31:37.896
I think I am him last year.

31:37.965 --> 31:41.000
I think we're, like, getting
closer than we've ever been.

31:41.068 --> 31:43.758
- That's good.

31:43.827 --> 31:47.137
- What is that face for?

31:47.206 --> 31:49.793
<i>- I can't understand why
nobody sees my perspective</i>

31:49.862 --> 31:52.724
on the fact that his sister
called and threatened me.

31:52.793 --> 31:54.896
<i>I have a right
to be mad at him about that.</i>

31:54.965 --> 31:56.965
- You said you're
getting close to who?

31:57.034 --> 31:58.344
- Gus-Gus.

31:58.413 --> 32:00.379
- Oh, the changes
from day to day,

32:00.448 --> 32:03.275
so I didn't know.
That's all I'm saying.

32:03.344 --> 32:07.241
They all know
what Gus' sister said.

32:07.310 --> 32:09.379
One minute it's
we on one team.

32:09.448 --> 32:11.413
And that's okay.
I'm not tripping about it.

32:11.482 --> 32:12.827
That's just what I made
that look,

32:12.896 --> 32:15.482
because the conversation
came out of nowhere to me.

32:15.551 --> 32:17.206
<i>And so I feel like there
should be some type</i>

32:17.275 --> 32:21.068
of position in taking amongst
my girls in the house.

32:21.137 --> 32:22.275
<i>But hey, whatever.</i>

32:22.344 --> 32:24.206
- I'm so confused right now.

32:24.275 --> 32:27.793
I was never trying to cause
any drama or hurt anyone,

32:27.862 --> 32:30.689
<i>so I just need to go outside
and get some fresh air.</i>

32:30.758 --> 32:32.724
- Can we all just
get along?

32:32.793 --> 32:36.241
- I don't understand who's mad.
- I don't know. I don't know.

32:36.310 --> 32:39.103
- Hey, if we can get along
as boys, no offense to y'all,

32:39.172 --> 32:40.827
y'all should be good.
- For real though.

32:40.896 --> 32:42.896
<i>- The guys over here are just
completely lost right now.</i>

32:42.965 --> 32:44.689
We're enjoying the bowling;
the girls are, like,

32:44.758 --> 32:46.586
getting into it over,
like, Lord knows what.

32:46.655 --> 32:48.206
<i>They say we're dramatic;
the guys are dramatic,</i>

32:48.275 --> 32:49.862
but look at this
Like, y'all are fighting

32:49.931 --> 32:54.172
at a bowling alley when we're
supposed to be having fun.

32:54.241 --> 32:55.827
- We wore our bowling
shoes out here.

32:55.896 --> 32:57.275
- I wonder why you have
to wear these.

32:57.344 --> 32:58.724
- I don't get it either.

32:58.793 --> 33:01.206
- I had a conversation
with Nilsa about me and Gus

33:01.275 --> 33:02.586
having a conversation last night,

33:02.655 --> 33:05.655
and it made Candace mad.
I feel like I relate

33:05.724 --> 33:07.206
to him a lot now,
because I feel like me

33:07.275 --> 33:10.000
and him are a lot alike,
and Candace got upset.

33:10.068 --> 33:13.310
- Well, I mean if anything,
you both know what it's like

33:13.379 --> 33:15.689
to come into the house
and deal with a breakup.

33:15.758 --> 33:19.379
I think Candace reads into
too much sometimes too.

33:19.448 --> 33:21.655
Why go through life
hating somebody?

33:21.724 --> 33:23.379
And trust me, I went through it
with Jeremiah.

33:23.448 --> 33:24.655
There were times where
I didn't want to be

33:24.724 --> 33:26.137
in the room with him.

33:26.206 --> 33:27.586
- Yeah, I don't hate anybody
on this Earth.

33:27.655 --> 33:29.103
- Yeah, I don't either.

33:29.172 --> 33:31.344
<i>- It's hard for me to say
what Candace should do,</i>

33:31.413 --> 33:33.862
because my relationship
with Gus

33:33.931 --> 33:37.034
<i>is a lot different than her
relationship with Gus.</i>

33:37.103 --> 33:40.206
And I understand
we're all different people,

33:40.275 --> 33:42.275
we all have different thoughts
of each other.

33:42.344 --> 33:45.103
So bottom line is,
I can be friends

33:45.172 --> 33:47.034
with whoever I want
in this house.

33:47.103 --> 33:48.862
You're a good person, Codi.

33:48.931 --> 33:51.034
- Like I said, I think I am.
- You are.

33:51.103 --> 33:53.103
A little [bleep]-stirrer
but a good person.

33:53.172 --> 33:56.068

34:15.517 --> 34:16.724

34:16.793 --> 34:18.482
"Listen, Bethany is coming."

34:18.551 --> 34:21.206
And I was like,
"No, not Bethany from Montana."

34:23.413 --> 34:25.689
- Hi ho, Silver, ladies.

34:25.758 --> 34:27.275
- Ooh, ow, hit it, hit.

34:27.344 --> 34:29.965

we love it!

34:32.724 --> 34:34.517
- She comes today?
- She comes tonight.

34:34.586 --> 34:36.862
- Okay.
- Y'all be nice to her.

34:36.931 --> 34:37.827
Well, I ain't got
to worry about y'all.

34:37.896 --> 34:38.965
- Yeah. Hell no.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.172
- We're going to be
nice to her.

34:40.241 --> 34:41.413
- Bro.

34:41.482 --> 34:42.862
- Bethany's a lot of fun,

34:42.931 --> 34:44.965
<i>and I'm really excited
for Gus to meet her.</i>

34:45.034 --> 34:47.551
Her positivity and smiles
are contagious,

34:47.620 --> 34:49.413
and she's got
one of the best in the world.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.275
- Is this chicken on here?

34:56.793 --> 34:59.517
- All the girls are pissed off
about something.

34:59.586 --> 35:00.793
I don't know what it is.

35:00.862 --> 35:03.034
At this point,
I'm scared to even ask.

35:03.103 --> 35:05.413
Well, I'll hang out with you.

35:05.482 --> 35:07.517
- Y'all hang out with somebody
I don't get along with, though.

35:07.586 --> 35:09.448
That's what I'm saying.
- I know.

35:09.517 --> 35:11.000
- That's the issue.

35:11.068 --> 35:13.517
- What's wrong with her?
- I have literally no clue.

35:13.586 --> 35:14.862
- I'm so confused.

35:14.931 --> 35:16.965
- Aimee was talking to me
about your conversation,

35:17.034 --> 35:19.172
and she's like, "I understand
where he's coming from,

35:19.241 --> 35:20.448
because I'm going through stuff."

35:20.517 --> 35:21.724
- Yeah, I don't know how
this got turned into

35:21.793 --> 35:23.931
a Candace thing.
- I have no clue.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.275
Everyone knows that
I'm not Gus' biggest fan,

35:26.344 --> 35:27.793
but I would never get mad
at Aimee

35:27.862 --> 35:30.137
<i>for, like, moving forward
with their relationship.</i>

35:30.206 --> 35:32.586
It doesn't have to do with me;
it has to do with Aimee.

35:32.655 --> 35:33.827
- Is she mad just because

35:33.896 --> 35:36.137
y'all are, like,
kind of being nice to me?

35:36.206 --> 35:38.103
- I don't know.
- That's what it looks like.

35:38.172 --> 35:39.793
- I don't know.

35:39.862 --> 35:41.689
- I thought we were all kind of
on agreeance like this vacation

35:41.758 --> 35:45.034
was to actually be a vacation
and not let baggage

35:45.103 --> 35:47.241
of the previous vacations
affect this one.

35:47.310 --> 35:48.655
- Exactly.
- Like, we've already hashed

35:48.724 --> 35:51.379
out everything we could
possibly hash out and me

35:51.448 --> 35:55.034
especially but everybody.
Like, I was trying to just

35:55.103 --> 35:56.310
come in
and leave the past in the past

35:56.379 --> 35:58.551
and just, like,
really just focus on now.

35:58.620 --> 35:59.793
- Well, he's bringing
his sister here

35:59.862 --> 36:01.172
and his sister threatened
to whup my ass.

36:01.241 --> 36:02.862
Like, you think I take
that lightly?

36:02.931 --> 36:06.172
If she pop up here, oh, baby,
she's coming into some

36:06.241 --> 36:09.206
If she threatened
to whup my ass on the phone,

36:09.275 --> 36:11.620
I'm going to ask
for my ass-whupping.

36:11.689 --> 36:15.103
That's what I'm saying.
Like, that's all that is.

36:15.172 --> 36:18.034
- Like, I know I was a
psychopath last time.

36:18.103 --> 36:21.034
Like, I admit it.
Everybody's got low points;

36:21.103 --> 36:22.413
it's just
how you come out of it.

36:22.482 --> 36:23.896
- Exactly.
- And learn from it.

36:23.965 --> 36:26.034
And me and her had a good talk
about that last night.

36:26.103 --> 36:27.586
- And that's all
she was talking about.

36:27.655 --> 36:29.620
- We all got our low spots.
We just got to learn from it

36:29.689 --> 36:32.068
and try not to make
the same mistakes over.

36:32.137 --> 36:33.482
- That's literally
all she was telling me.

36:33.551 --> 36:35.275
- Yeah.

36:35.344 --> 36:37.241
<i>- Right now, things appear to

Y'all got to give me

39:18.103 --> 39:19.172

39:19.241 --> 39:20.620
She should fit
in just fine then.

39:20.689 --> 39:22.827

39:22.896 --> 39:24.344

39:24.413 --> 39:26.034
