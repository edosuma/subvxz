00:11.304 --> 00:13.723
<i>NARRATOR".
A glorious morning in Gotham City.</i>

00:13.890 --> 00:18.978
<i>But in Commissioner Gordon's office,
the Siren readies a nasty scheme.</i>

00:30.281 --> 00:33.701
Now, commissioner,
you are ready to do my bidding.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.788
Your merest wish is my ultimate command.

00:36.955 --> 00:40.208
Just say "yes," that will be sufficient,
although superfluous.

00:40.375 --> 00:43.670
No man can resist the stunning note
of my voice.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.589
Two octaves above high C.

00:46.756 --> 00:49.425
- I want you to call Batman.
-Batman?

00:49.592 --> 00:55.431
Call him and have him meet you
in some neutral place.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.850
If you desire.

00:58.810 --> 00:59.978
How about--?

01:00.144 --> 01:02.480
- How about my daughter's apartment?
-Splendid.

01:02.647 --> 01:04.315
- What am I to say to him?
-Nothing.

01:04.482 --> 01:07.652
- Nothing?
-You will not show up for the meeting.

01:07.819 --> 01:11.155
Just be sure you know
where he parks the Batmobile.

01:11.406 --> 01:14.909
In the underground garage
of her apartment building. Where else?

01:15.076 --> 01:17.370
How superbly suitable.

01:20.665 --> 01:23.376
Barbara Gordon's apartment?
Why there?

01:23.543 --> 01:27.088
Ours is not to reason why, Dick.
We're duly deputized minions of the law...

01:27.255 --> 01:29.591
...Commissioner Gordon
is our immediate superior...

01:29.757 --> 01:33.553
...and good crime-fighters
always obey orders.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.514
- To the Batpoles.
-Roger.

02:54.842 --> 02:59.430
<i>NARRATOR". And now, in Barbara Gordon's
apartment, the mystery deepens.</i>

02:59.597 --> 03:00.848
I can't fathom it.

03:01.015 --> 03:04.394
This is the first time Commissioner Gordon
failed to keep an appointment.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.729
It's not like him. Not like him at all.

03:06.896 --> 03:08.314
I was looking for him myself.

03:08.481 --> 03:11.192
And his secretary, Bonnie, thought
he might be coming here.

03:11.359 --> 03:14.112
- I certainly hope nothing's happened to him.
-Gosh, yes.

03:14.278 --> 03:17.281
But why would he wanna meet us here
and not in his office?

03:17.782 --> 03:20.535
He must have had a very good reason,
Robin.

03:20.702 --> 03:24.747
Commissioner Gordon
does not take his responsibilities lightly.

03:27.417 --> 03:29.836
I don't know how long they'll be there,
so work fast.

03:30.002 --> 03:34.424
Now, remember, your primary mission
is to discover the location of the Batcave...

03:34.590 --> 03:37.969
...and the true identities
of Robin and Batman.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.762
With that knowledge as a weapon...

03:39.929 --> 03:43.599
...plus the fortune that I plan to get
from millionaire Bruce Wayne...

03:43.766 --> 03:45.601
...my plan will be complete.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.812
It's a beautiful plan.

03:47.979 --> 03:50.022
Beautiful. Heh.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.070
Would any of you care for a soft drink?

03:56.237 --> 03:59.157
No, thank you, Ms. Gordon.
We might find it too relaxing.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.659
First order of business
is to locate your father.

04:01.826 --> 04:04.162
Sure, and that's the truth.

04:04.579 --> 04:07.457
Perhaps the Batcomputer
could be of some help, Robin.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.292
Roger.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.836
Goodbye, Ms. Gordon.

04:12.003 --> 04:14.672
And don't worry about your father.

04:17.884 --> 04:23.389
<i>NARRATOR". And shortly, in the Siren's hideout
in a subterranean grotto...</i>

04:35.276 --> 04:38.070
Batman and Robin, you're finished, I say.

04:38.237 --> 04:42.825
For hidden inside of your car,
Commissioner Gordon is lurking...

04:42.992 --> 04:47.622
...and soon he'll tell me whoever you are.
Ha, ha.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.101
Nothing quite so pleasant
as a musical interlude, eh, boys?

05:09.268 --> 05:12.897
You hired us to be criminals, Siren,
not critics.

05:13.064 --> 05:17.902
All we've been doing is losing a week of time
while you sit around and strum the strings.

05:18.402 --> 05:23.282
Patience, I can see, is not one of your virtues,
if indeed you have any.

05:23.449 --> 05:26.786
But you needn't wait much longer,
my dear Allegro.

05:26.953 --> 05:31.040
The first step in my fantastic plan
has already been completed.

05:31.207 --> 05:36.337
Even as we converse,
my operation is rapidly coming to fruition.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.298
Like most women,
you keep talking about your operation.

05:39.465 --> 05:41.425
But you still haven't told us what it is.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.637
For openers, boys,
who remembers the good women of history?

05:44.804 --> 05:47.515
Florence Nightingale and Molly Pitcher...

05:47.682 --> 05:54.438
...they pale in comparison to Mata Hari,
Lucrezia Borgia and Lady Macbeth.

05:54.605 --> 05:58.109
Evil is what makes the world go round.

05:58.276 --> 06:02.113
And I want to be evil.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.865
I'm not knocking evil, Siren.

06:04.031 --> 06:09.287
But don't forget Catwoman and Black Widow,
they all went up the river because of Batman.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.706
Right you are, my musical mobster.

06:11.873 --> 06:15.501
But those amateurs neglected one thing.

06:15.668 --> 06:19.547
They neglected to expose Batman's identity.

06:19.714 --> 06:21.007
Once that's done...

06:21.173 --> 06:25.177
...the cowled crime-fighter's efficiency
will be dissipated...

06:25.344 --> 06:29.765
...leaving me a clear path
to ravage and pillage Gotham City...

06:29.932 --> 06:34.228
...as it's never been
ravaged and pillaged before.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.232
I want to become the wickedest woman...

06:41.861 --> 06:45.656
...in Gotham City and thus, in the world.

06:49.827 --> 06:53.497
With the help of Bruce Wayne's fortune...

06:55.333 --> 06:59.170
...which I shall shortly control.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.848
Barbara, it doesn't look
as though your father is going to show up.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.808
I'm afraid you're right, Chief O'Hara.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.312
I'll be getting back to the office.
If I hear from him, I'll call you.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.856
Do that. Even if I'm out, I'll get the message.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.733
Even if you're out, you'll answer?

07:20.900 --> 07:24.362
Well, not exactly that.
My phone answers for me.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.865
Oh, sure,
then it's one of those tricky little gizmos...

07:28.032 --> 07:31.410
...that answers in your own voice
and then replays the messages.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.789
Oh, sure, and it is, Chief O'Hara.
At least it won't be answering...

07:34.956 --> 07:38.250
...in Lorelei Circe's voice
or all the windows would be broken.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.461
- Whose voice?
-Lorelei Circe.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.547
She's the world-famous chanteuse
who's appearing in Gotham City.

07:43.714 --> 07:47.051
She has a range of seven octaves.
And when she sings her highest note...

07:47.218 --> 07:50.930
...I'm told only hunting dogs can hear it,
and are completely stunned.

07:51.097 --> 07:53.516
Well, let's hope your father
doesn't run into her.

07:53.683 --> 07:55.351
Oh, I'm just spoofing you, Barbara.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.478
I'm sure he'll show up safe and sound.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.146
Good bye.

08:08.239 --> 08:12.743
Charlie, am I jumping
to the world's biggest conclusion?

08:12.910 --> 08:16.038
Could my father have run into Lorelei Circe?

08:16.205 --> 08:17.873
Lorelei Circe.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.085
Lorelei, a temptress...

08:21.252 --> 08:25.381
...a siren who lives in a grotto.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.591
The Grotto Arms.

08:27.758 --> 08:30.803
I read that's where she's been staying.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.432
<i>NARRATOR".
What's on Barbara's mind, Charlie?</i>

08:34.597 --> 08:40.062
<i>Is she about to go into action
as that Dominoed Dare-doll Batgirl?</i>

09:24.440 --> 09:27.902
- What is the matter with it?
-Perhaps it doesn't understand our question...

09:28.069 --> 09:29.820
...about Commissioner Gordon, Robin.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.989
I've never seen that light flash before.

09:32.156 --> 09:35.284
Well, that's the Batcomputer
Bat-resistance Signal.

09:36.327 --> 09:41.290
Of course it doesn't understand our question
about Commissioner Gordon. It can't answer it.

09:41.457 --> 09:44.126
Commissioner Gordon
represents law and order.

09:44.293 --> 09:47.379
The Batcomputer is programmed
to deal only with criminals.

09:47.546 --> 09:52.301
Holy one-track Batcomputer mind. I guess
we'll have to figure this one out for ourselves.

09:52.468 --> 09:56.764
Not without some nourishment, old churn.
The body needs food as well as the mind.

09:56.931 --> 09:59.266
Good evening, sir. Through for the day?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.936
Just going to grab a bite,
then get back to business.

10:02.103 --> 10:03.687
Which is, if I may ask?

10:03.854 --> 10:05.940
Locating Commissioner Gordon, Alfred.

10:06.107 --> 10:09.193
Very good, sir.
If you'll excuse me, I have a little dusting to do.

10:09.360 --> 10:13.197
You'll find your milk and sandwiches
already prepared in the study.

10:13.364 --> 10:15.157
Thank you, Alfred.

10:36.554 --> 10:40.224
Commissioner Gordon.
What are you doing here?

10:40.558 --> 10:41.725
YOu?

10:42.476 --> 10:46.021
You're Alfred,
millionaire Bruce Wayne's butler.

10:46.188 --> 10:51.110
And that voice, the same nameless voice
that often answers the Batphone.

10:51.277 --> 10:55.281
- I'm afraid you're making a mistake, sir.
-Mistake? Nonsense.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.575
Obviously, this is the Batcave.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.704
Ergo, Batman is Bruce Wayne...

11:01.871 --> 11:06.250
...and Dick Grayson is Robin,
The Boy Wonder. Hmm, hmm.

11:07.376 --> 11:11.088
Batman and Bruce Wayne,
one and the same.

11:11.255 --> 11:15.301
I must convey this information
at once to the Siren.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.760
The Siren?

11:16.927 --> 11:19.471
I think you're making
a grave error of judgment, sir.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.433
You're being very civilized about this.

11:22.600 --> 11:26.145
Most butlers would do anything
at this moment to stop me.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.480
- Quite right, commissioner.
-Oh.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.775
Yes, indeed.

11:33.319 --> 11:34.778
Nothing.

11:35.613 --> 11:37.781
We should get into town
and survey the area...

11:37.948 --> 11:41.535
...where Commissioner Gordon was last seen.
Perhaps we can find a clue there.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.288
You need look no further, sir.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.708
- Commissioner Gordon.
-Commissioner Gordon.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.627
Sound asleep, sir.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.588
I found him in the Batcave.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.133
Sound asleep in the Batcave?

11:56.300 --> 11:59.386
But he was awake when
he stepped out of the rear of the Batmobile.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.722
Thanks to a sizable dose of Bat-Sleep...

12:01.889 --> 12:04.391
...he is now languishing
in the arms of Morpheus.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.976
Great Scott.

12:06.143 --> 12:11.315
Yes. And I'm afraid he knows
the true identities of each of you.

12:19.323 --> 12:22.868
In the absence of any word from
Commissioner Gordon, I shall now make a call.

12:23.035 --> 12:25.829
- Like me to do it, Siren?
-Oh, no, Andante.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.874
I'm the only person in the world
that can deliver my message...

12:29.041 --> 12:30.376
...to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.461
The millionaire playboy?

12:32.628 --> 12:35.881
The soon-to-be ex-millionaire playboy.

12:36.048 --> 12:39.927
My next move is to relieve Mr. Wayne
of his fabulous fortune.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.471
With Batman revealed
by Commissioner Gordon...

12:42.638 --> 12:44.265
...and thus permanently impaired...

12:44.431 --> 12:49.019
...and with Bruce Wayne's millions
in my possession, I'll be unstoppable.

12:56.402 --> 12:58.279
Information?

12:58.862 --> 13:01.865
I'd like the number
of stately Wayne Manor, please.

13:02.032 --> 13:06.704
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, at their handsome
residence, our heroes remained puzzled.</i>

13:07.830 --> 13:12.293
- How much Bat-Sleep did you give him, Alfred?
-I should say approximately 12 hours worth, sir.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.838
What could have caused him
to do such a thing? Hide in the Batmobile?

13:16.005 --> 13:18.424
Our main concern now
is what to do with him.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.177
He can't sleep forever and when he wakes up,
he intends to tell-- Who was it?

13:22.344 --> 13:25.806
- Someone called the Siren, sir.
-Obviously, the perpetrator of this sinister plot.

13:27.516 --> 13:28.892
Hello?

13:29.310 --> 13:31.979
Yes, yes, this is millionaire Bruce Wayne.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.741
Meet me in my private office
at the Wayne Foundation Building...

13:43.907 --> 13:45.617
...in a half hour?

13:45.909 --> 13:47.411
I'll be there.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.705
Is everything all right, sir?

13:50.914 --> 13:54.293
Everything is fine, Alfred.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.589
- Where are you going, Bruce?
- That is not your concern, Dick.

13:58.756 --> 14:00.758
I have a personal matter to attend to.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.177
But you can't leave now.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.264
Something's very wrong, Alfred.
Bruce never acted that way before.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.933
And right after that telephone call, sir.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.602
I'm going to see what it's all about.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.278
You'll never know unless you answer it,
Master Dick.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.951
- Hello?
-Robin, this is Batgirl.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.037
Batgirl. On the Batphone?

14:30.329 --> 14:33.582
I'm in Commissioner Gordon's office.
No one else is here.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.709
I must speak to Batman at once.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.213
I'm afraid he's, uh, unavailable right now.
Can I help you?

14:39.588 --> 14:41.131
Well, perhaps you can.

14:41.298 --> 14:45.344
A frightful thing is happening.
I can't go into detail over the phone.

14:45.511 --> 14:48.013
But by some sort of sonic spell...

14:48.180 --> 14:51.892
<i>...the Siren intends forcing Bruce Wayne
to give up his fortune to her.</i>

14:52.059 --> 14:53.477
So that's it.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.605
And it seems she can project this sound
over the phone.

14:56.772 --> 15:00.567
I think that's what might have happened to my--
Commissioner Gordon.

15:00.818 --> 15:03.529
Meet you at Wayne Foundation Building
as soon as possible.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.157
- And Batman?
-He, uh, may be there too.

15:10.661 --> 15:13.789
<i>NARRATOR".
Later, in Bruce Wayne's private office...</i>

15:13.956 --> 15:17.376
<i>...in the Wayne Foundation Building...</i>

15:40.190 --> 15:42.609
You now have the Wayne family jewels.

15:42.776 --> 15:46.697
You have everything,
including all my ready cash.

15:46.864 --> 15:51.034
Oh, there's still the little matter of your signing
over the property, stocks and bonds...

15:51.201 --> 15:52.911
...of the Wayne fortune to me.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.204
Oh, yes.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.874
Do you have the necessary legal forms?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.959
Andante.

16:09.803 --> 16:13.724
<i>NARRATOR". While in the lobby
of the Wayne Foundation Building...</i>

16:18.812 --> 16:22.691
He must still be under her influence,
so we'll have to deal gingerly with Mr. Wayne.

16:22.858 --> 16:25.861
You bet.
Wouldn't want an innocent man to get hurt.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.489
I only wish Batman were here to help us.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.241
He may be here sooner than you think.

16:31.408 --> 16:32.701
Holy standstills.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.620
I wish this elevator would get here.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.830
No telling what they're up to.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.960
There. That should do it.

16:44.630 --> 16:49.259
I now have everything I want. Everything.

16:49.510 --> 16:52.304
Except the identity of Batman.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.847
Batman?

16:54.014 --> 16:56.767
No doubt Commissioner Gordon
is back in his office by now...

16:56.934 --> 16:59.561
...and has probably been trying to call them.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.444
Commissioner Gordon's office.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.613
No, the commissioner is not here.

17:09.780 --> 17:13.282
This is Chief of Police O'Hara speaking.
May I do something for you?

17:14.076 --> 17:16.118
Yes.

17:24.795 --> 17:28.048
Go jump in Gotham Park Lake. Ha, ha.

17:38.976 --> 17:42.396
We heard that, Siren, and you're sending
an innocent man to drown himself.

17:42.563 --> 17:45.816
Well, look who's here. Batgirl and Batboy.

17:45.983 --> 17:48.318
There's no escape, Siren.
Better give yourself up.

17:48.485 --> 17:51.488
- We'll soon see about that.
- That won't do you any good at all.

17:52.823 --> 17:56.201
Girls are impervious
to your entrancing voice.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.161
And I'm wearing Bat-earplugs...

17:58.328 --> 18:01.665
...that successfully screen out any sound
above 14,000 decibels.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.042
Your goose, so to speak, is cooked.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.587
Not by a long shot, short stuff.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.381
I now own this building.

18:09.548 --> 18:10.716
Is that true, Mr. Wayne?

18:10.882 --> 18:13.677
She now owns this building.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.096
And I hereby order you off the premises.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.725
This is private property and you cannot
come in here without a warrant.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.060
She has us there, Robin.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.854
Holy Fourth Amendment.

18:24.021 --> 18:28.525
So if you'll just make yourselves scarce,
I won't have to report you to the police.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.362
This way out.

18:32.529 --> 18:33.572
Come on, Batgirl.

18:33.739 --> 18:36.116
- But there must be some--
-We're licked.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.623
You'll pay a pretty price for this, Siren.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.090
Let's get this thing over with.

18:52.257 --> 18:56.053
- What are you gonna do with him?
-Bruce Wayne? That penniless fop?

18:56.428 --> 18:57.888
Now that he has no fortune...

18:58.055 --> 19:01.892
...he's going to do what many other bankers
in his position have done.

19:02.059 --> 19:05.103
He's going to leap off the roof.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.774
I'm going to leap off the roof.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.735
Good boy.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.324
Dropping that bugging device
was a smart move, Robin.

19:17.491 --> 19:20.619
Maybe not smart enough.
They've just taken the elevator to the roof.

19:20.786 --> 19:23.413
She's going to make Bruce Wayne jump.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.880
- The stairway?
-Yes. You're in good shape.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.927
Come on, now.

19:37.469 --> 19:41.473
Just one more step.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.230
Don't do it, Mr. Wayne.

20:42.743 --> 20:45.454
Get in there and help my men.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.544
Sorry about this, Mr. Wayne.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.797
Help me. Help.

20:58.383 --> 21:01.344
Why should I?
You were willing to let Bruce Wayne leap.

21:01.762 --> 21:04.264
Can we talk about it after you pull me up?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.767
Can you get Mr. Wayne out of that spell?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.686
I--
Can you?

21:10.562 --> 21:12.522
I might try singing an antidote note.

21:12.689 --> 21:13.982
Then do it.

21:14.149 --> 21:17.527
Oh, but that's three octaves above high C.
Nobody's ever done it before.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.362
My voice would be gone.

21:19.529 --> 21:20.989
I'd rather die.

21:21.156 --> 21:22.949
I'd rather live.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.204
All right, <i>I'll</i> try it.

21:28.038 --> 21:32.709
- Oh, Bruce, if only you were more like Batman.
-Batman.

21:32.876 --> 21:37.714
Perhaps then you would have had the
strength to resist the Siren's stunning spell.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.801
All right, Siren, do your stuff.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.232
Robin.

21:56.024 --> 21:59.236
- Batgirl. What's going on here?
-Don't worry about a thing, Mr. Wayne.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.488
You're all right now. What about the others?

22:01.655 --> 22:03.573
Chief O'Hara.

22:09.246 --> 22:10.747
Here we go.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.256
Oh.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.259
Batman.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.593
Barbara.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.970
What's going on?

22:25.136 --> 22:27.848
You were under the spell of the Siren,
Daddy.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.766
The Siren, eh?

22:29.933 --> 22:33.520
Hmm. The last thing I remember is...

22:35.438 --> 22:40.652
That's funny.
I can't remember the last thing I remember.

22:41.611 --> 22:45.782
Permanent amnesia apparently lasts
as long as a person is under Siren's spell.

22:46.116 --> 22:47.909
I feel like Rip van Winkle.

22:48.076 --> 22:49.786
You only slept like him.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.455
Batman and Robin
took care of things perfectly.

22:52.622 --> 22:53.957
Don't forget Batgirl.

22:54.124 --> 22:57.502
And speaking of Batgirl, she was on her way
to fish Chief O'Hara out of--

22:57.669 --> 22:58.920
Gotham Park Lake.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.755
And begorra, she did.

23:00.922 --> 23:04.009
But after she rescued me, she just vanished.

23:04.175 --> 23:07.804
I walked over to the office to dry off...

23:09.222 --> 23:11.808
...but I didn't do much drying.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.604
All's well that ends well.

23:15.770 --> 23:19.816
Particularly now that millionaire Bruce Wayne's
millions have been returned to him.

23:19.983 --> 23:23.653
And Siren will be singing her stunning notes
from a cage with iron bars.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.989
How right you are, Robin.

23:26.156 --> 23:27.616
Shall we go?

23:37.542 --> 23:41.630
Warden Crichton should find the Siren
a model prisoner, commissioner...

23:41.796 --> 23:43.715
...if she doesn't open her mouth.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.095
What in the world was that?

23:50.305 --> 23:53.683
It's our newly-developed
Criminal Sensor Bat-indicator, commissioner...

23:53.850 --> 23:59.689
...which apparently suggests that Penguin
has returned to the environs of Gotham City.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.986
Lulu. Speak to me, Lulu.

24:05.153 --> 24:09.324
Don't call me Lulu, Pengy.
It's Senora Lola Lasagne now.

24:09.491 --> 24:12.494
Now, I'm not here in Gotham City
to be bothered by you.

24:12.661 --> 24:17.999
I'm here to enter my prize-winning horse
in the Wayne Foundation handicap.

24:23.046 --> 24:27.926
We're gonna make a tidy bundle
on that race, Lulu. Whah, Whah, whah.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.886
And not only Penguin, commissioner...

24:30.053 --> 24:33.765
...but some new female accomplice
named Lola Lasagne.

24:34.224 --> 24:38.061
<i>NARRATOR". Will Batman need more than luck
with Penguin and Lola?</i>

24:38.228 --> 24:41.481
