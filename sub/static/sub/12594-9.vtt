00:02.700 --> 00:05.168
***

00:09.370 --> 00:11.463
- I gotta go.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.478
I want to head home
before work.

00:13.510 --> 00:17.173
- Thought you, of all people,
would have a spare suit
in their car.

00:17.210 --> 00:19.815
- "Be prepared."

00:19.850 --> 00:22.648
Isn't that the boy scout motto?
- Yeah,

00:22.690 --> 00:25.113
but a man knows a Gucci suit
"don't" belong in no trunk.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.210
I'm working tomorrow,

00:28.260 --> 00:30.558
but I'm off
the day after, so...

00:30.590 --> 00:33.127
- Actually, I had
something else in mind.

00:36.130 --> 00:38.325
- It's the one-year anniversary
of my dad's death.

00:38.370 --> 00:41.134
- Oh, my bad. Didn't know.

00:41.170 --> 00:43.058
- You wouldn't.
I don't talk about it.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.465
I thought I'd have
a poker game in his honour,

00:45.510 --> 00:48.502
invite a few people over.
If you're interested...

00:48.540 --> 00:51.145
Chance
to hang out, take your money.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.171
- Haha! Good luck with that.

01:00.890 --> 01:03.484
- I really gotta go.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.521
- I know.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.755
Those homicides
won't solve themselves.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.791
***

01:26.150 --> 01:28.846
- Wake up. Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.888
We fell asleep?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.888
- Yeah.
: Dad, are you

01:35.920 --> 01:38.229
driving me or what?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.251
- Oh, OK. You--
- You stay here.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.120
Stay here, I'll go.
- No, I--

01:42.170 --> 01:44.161
: Dad!
- Yeah, I'm coming, honey!

01:44.200 --> 01:45.895
Just stay here. Stay here.
- Go!

01:45.930 --> 01:48.137
: Hurry up!

01:48.170 --> 01:49.808
- Oh! Hey! Everybody's up

01:49.840 --> 01:51.899
and ready to start
a run-ofâ€”the-mill old day.

01:51.940 --> 01:54.829
Did you just get up?

01:54.880 --> 01:56.575
- Yeah, I slept
through my alarm.

01:56.610 --> 01:59.170
- You never do that.
- Set It wrong.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.869
You know, AM, PM;
It's crazy, right?

02:00.920 --> 02:03.809
- Yeah, that can be
a real brain buster.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.284
I think I better take
Jules to school.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.652
Again.
- Bye, Mom!

02:08.690 --> 02:10.578
- Oh, she's asleep.
In her room.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.554
I know a guy, he's got a kid

02:13.600 --> 02:15.852
about your age and he started
to babble and poof.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.721
- I'm fine, Dad.
Goodbye.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.659
- OK. Bye.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.170
- Oof! Hell of a way
to wake up. Although,

02:30.210 --> 02:32.747
who could blame us for needing
the extra rest after last night?

02:32.780 --> 02:34.418
- Haha! Yeah, Becca,
about that--

02:34.450 --> 02:36.918
- Nothing we haven't
done before.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.817
We'll just chalk it up
to stress relief.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.919
Oh, my God!
I have to go.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.520
Today is the final callback
for the talk show!

02:44.560 --> 02:46.824
Wish me luck.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.897
***

02:54.900 --> 02:57.368
***

02:59.510 --> 03:01.398
- Hey, I got your message.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.977
What's going on?
- Hey, guys, you wanna take

03:04.010 --> 03:06.376
a pee break?
Not together obviously, but...

03:06.420 --> 03:08.547
Thank you.

03:08.580 --> 03:11.743
- Love the new digs. Boy, that
promotion really paid off, huh?

03:11.790 --> 03:14.509
Hahaha!
- We're a little tight
on office space right now, OK?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.619
- What's with the cloak
and dagger routine?

03:18.360 --> 03:20.396
- OK, look. What I'm telling you
right now does not leave

03:20.430 --> 03:24.469
this room. Now there's
a woman I've been seeing.
- Oh, I'm skeptical already.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.866
- Her name is Heather.
She works in Court Services.
- Oh, let me guess. She's

03:26.900 --> 03:29.505
a little crazy, but it's hot and
you want us to find out if she's

03:29.540 --> 03:31.735
gonna burn down your house?
- She screwed up,

03:31.770 --> 03:33.704
and she needs help
or she's gonna lose her job.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.833
- OK, and why can't
you help her?

03:35.880 --> 03:37.973
- I can't do it officially,
and I can't keep a lid on this

03:38.010 --> 03:41.013
for much longer.
So what I'm doing is cashing in

03:41.050 --> 03:43.917
on one of the million bajillion
favours that you owe me.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.888
- How big a screw-up
are we talking?

03:46.920 --> 03:50.026
- This morning, Heather got
a call to transfer a perp,

03:50.060 --> 03:52.028
name of Galen Baxter,
from the hospital

03:52.060 --> 03:54.255
to his bail hearing.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.463
Check it out.

04:01.870 --> 04:04.964
- I'm not seeing a problem here.
- Wait for it.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.898
Here they are,
arriving at the courthouse.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.814
- That is the million-dollar
question.

04:24.530 --> 04:27.852
- ** I see you and you see me

04:27.900 --> 04:30.425
* Watch you blowing the lines

04:30.470 --> 04:32.392
* When you're making a scene

04:32.440 --> 04:35.989
* Oh boy, you've got to know

04:36.040 --> 04:37.962
* What my head overlooks

04:38.010 --> 04:41.832
* The senses will show
to my heart *

04:41.880 --> 04:44.303
* When it's watching for lies

04:44.350 --> 04:46.818
* 'Cause you can't escape my

04:46.850 --> 04:48.715
- * Private eyes

04:48.750 --> 04:50.980
* They're watching you

04:51.020 --> 04:52.885
* Private eyes

04:52.920 --> 04:55.013
* They're watching you,
watching you *

04:55.060 --> 04:57.620
* Watching you, watching you *

04:59.560 --> 05:01.619
***

05:04.370 --> 05:06.838
- I found Galen's website.

05:06.870 --> 05:08.963
Turns out _ _
he's a professmnal magICIan

05:09.000 --> 05:10.900
who specializes
in elaborate illusions.

05:10.940 --> 05:12.976
- I'll say.
- Shade,

05:13.010 --> 05:16.639
the rabbit is not Galen.
- Yeah, I know.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.547
- According
to the police report,

05:19.580 --> 05:21.844
Galen was returning from Mexico
when he was caught

05:21.880 --> 05:24.110
trying to smuggle
some ancient Mayan artifacts.

05:24.150 --> 05:26.857
- Hm, looks like some kind
of stone monkey.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.619
What would a magician
want with this?

05:28.660 --> 05:30.651
- No idea. I posted it

05:30.690 --> 05:32.726
in some online archeological
forums to see if I could

05:32.760 --> 05:35.729
find out how valuable it is.
- Says his wrist was broken.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.899
- He resisted arrest,
was transferred to a hospital.

05:37.930 --> 05:40.069
- No criminal record,
no history of violence;

05:40.100 --> 05:42.898
why the sudden change?
- Maybe it's a publicity stunt.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.704
A low-level magician upping
his profile by pulling off

05:45.740 --> 05:47.708
a major escape.
- There's easier ways

05:47.740 --> 05:50.538
to get attention. So do we start
with Fugitive 101?

05:50.580 --> 05:53.117
Talk to his known associates?
- Galen's webSIte says

05:53.150 --> 05:56.916
he's a member of
the Magic House. It's
a magicians' hangout downtown.

05:56.950 --> 05:59.384
- Maybe somebody there knows
how to make him reappear.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.718
***
- The rabbit stays.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.619
- See you later, Galen.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.439
- Excuse me.
Maybe you could help us.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.563
- Welcome to the Magic House.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.137
My name is the Amazing Dwight!

06:19.640 --> 06:21.972
Supposed to be a flower
growing out of my hand,

06:22.010 --> 06:23.875
but clearly, that didn't work.
- We'll take your word for it.

06:23.910 --> 06:25.878
Is there someone
In charge here?

06:25.910 --> 06:27.878
- Krishna the Magnificent
owns the club.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.081
I can take you to her,
but first...

06:30.120 --> 06:32.884
- Oh no, we don't
have time for--
- This is a good one,

06:32.920 --> 06:35.650
I promise. Please,
just let me have this, OK?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.898
- Wow! You should

06:48.940 --> 06:51.738
ditch that flower bit.
This one's a showstopper.

06:57.110 --> 06:59.908
- Magicians never tell.
Krishna's over there

06:59.950 --> 07:01.747
if you would like
to go see her.

07:01.780 --> 07:04.613
- Thanks.

07:04.650 --> 07:06.140
- That was cool.

07:06.190 --> 07:08.511
***

07:10.230 --> 07:12.448
- I started the Magic House
20 years ago

07:12.500 --> 07:15.094
as a place for magicians
to hone their craft.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.462
Since then, we've expanded

07:17.500 --> 07:19.468
added the theatre
for public shows.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.038
- I understand that Galen's been
a member here for 10 years.

07:23.070 --> 07:26.528
- I knew right away there was
something special about Galen.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.640
He's devoted to the art
of magic. He's a true master

07:29.680 --> 07:32.240
of m_isdi_rection. _
He's got this Signature trick,

07:32.280 --> 07:34.475
Edison's Dream,
it's remarkable.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.147
- When's the last time
he was here?

07:36.180 --> 07:39.479
- A week ago, maybe.
He's been going down to Mexico

07:39.520 --> 07:41.681
once a month for the past year.
He's performing at a resort.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.824
- Is that a long way
to go for a job?

07:43.860 --> 07:45.782
- Not a lot of local gigs
to go around. Unless you're

07:45.830 --> 07:49.698
David Blaine, a regular show
like that is as good as it gets.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.891
- Is there anyone that Galen was
close to

07:51.930 --> 07:53.966
- Not since Donatella.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.537
- The Demonic Donatella.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.561
She and Galen had
a two-person stage act.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.578
Pretty successful
until a year ago.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.202
- They split up.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.902
It was out of the blue.
Galen wouldn't say why.

08:04.950 --> 08:08.147
***

08:08.180 --> 08:10.284
- I stopped performing
over a year ago.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.117
I'm surprised
that you found me.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.756
-_ When was the last
time you saw Galen?
- Not since we broke up.

08:15.790 --> 08:18.054
- Both.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.899
Galen and I are different.

08:19.930 --> 08:23.058
In the beginning,
that's what made us work,

08:23.100 --> 08:26.024
but about a year ago,
we got into a fight
and things fell apart.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.789
- Must have been some fight
if you quit the business.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.899
- Galen thinks
that magic can solve

08:30.940 --> 08:33.829
all of life's problems,

08:33.880 --> 08:37.270
and somewhere along the way,
I stopped believing.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.909
What is this about anyway?

08:40.950 --> 08:43.612
- Galen was arrested last night
coming back from Mexico.

08:43.650 --> 08:46.778
!
- He got caught
smuggling Mayan artifacts.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.687
- That... that doesn't
make sense.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.584
I knew he had
a gig down there,

08:51.630 --> 08:53.621
but Galen's not a criminal!

08:59.640 --> 09:02.803
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.035
OK, I'll be right there.

09:05.070 --> 09:08.574
- Yeah. Becca wants me

09:08.610 --> 09:10.646
to come meet her, says
it's some kind of emergency.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.671
- Hi-ho, Silver.

09:16.850 --> 09:19.011
***

09:33.640 --> 09:36.734
What's the emergency?
- Everything's falling apart.

09:36.770 --> 09:39.603
I keep forgetting my lines,
and my mouth is so dry,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.335
and the decor
clashes with my suit!

09:41.380 --> 09:44.076
I was working!

09:44.110 --> 09:47.079
- This is the
biggest day of my life!
- You say that about everything!

09:47.120 --> 09:49.372
Birthdays, haircuts,
sidewalk sales.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.014
- Excuse me for caring about
the things that make me happy.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.655
- Becca, I can't come running
every time you have a meltdown!

09:54.690 --> 09:57.818
- Come on! You're so good at
"pesting" me out of these funks.

09:57.860 --> 10:01.057
Please, Shadow. Do it.
- Fine.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.897
You're one of those

10:02.930 --> 10:04.989
rare women who gets
more beautiful with age.

10:05.030 --> 10:08.033
- Like Susan Sarandon.
- People used to watch the news

10:08.070 --> 10:09.833
just to see
your weather report.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.031
- The ratings always slqrocketed
whenever I wore a V-neck.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.903
- Let's face it, it's not
your best work.

10:14.940 --> 10:17.044
- Feel free to give
the job to someone else.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.878
- I just figured it out.
You used to be Becca Shade.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.014
And I'm a huge fan of yours,
Mr. Shade.

10:23.050 --> 10:26.315
Maggie Melroy. I'm the
producer here.
- Thanks.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.784
But I'm nothing compared
to my ex-wife.

10:28.820 --> 10:32.051
She put up with me for 8 years.
Trust me, she can do anything.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.990
- Let's hope this job
has better benefits.

10:34.030 --> 10:36.726
- You two are hilarious
together, you know that?

10:36.770 --> 10:39.398
- Matt always did say humour
was one of my good qualities.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.660
- Actually, I said humour
was your one good quality.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.032
- Only because you can't
count any higher.

10:44.070 --> 10:46.038
- Hey, listen,
if you're not doing anything,

10:46.070 --> 10:48.072
why don't you stick
around and watch

10:48.110 --> 10:49.998
the auditions.
She's gonna kill it.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.041
- False wall.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.741
- He's not listening! I'm having
flashbacks to our marriage.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.985
- I gotta go.
Nice to meet you, Maggie.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.026
- Is he always
this mysterious?

11:03.060 --> 11:05.028
- That's Shade for you.

11:05.060 --> 11:07.290
Always keeps you
in the dark.

11:07.330 --> 11:09.127
***

11:12.170 --> 11:13.637
- What are we doing

11:13.670 --> 11:16.332
here, Shade?
- You'll thank me when your
girlfriend gets clear of this

11:16.370 --> 11:18.338
and wants to play "Search
and Seizure" in your pants.

11:18.370 --> 11:21.828
Sure this is the right truck?
- Uh, yeah.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.047
- Krishna told us that Galen was
a master at misdirection, right?

11:28.080 --> 11:31.117
He wanted us to focus
on the rabbit.

11:31.150 --> 11:34.119
- Not the vehicle.

11:47.270 --> 11:50.000
- Nice work!

11:50.040 --> 11:52.975
- Now all we have to do is find
a guy who disappears
for a living.

11:58.010 --> 12:01.719
- What exactly
are we looking for here?
- I'll know it when I see it.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.427
There.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.064
That's Galen.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.091
Two guards go in,
three come out.

12:19.130 --> 12:21.439
- Son of a bitch hid
a uniform behind the wall.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.461
Oh, this makes
Heather look even worse.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.135
- If Galen had access to a paddy
wagon to build a false wall,

12:28.180 --> 12:30.478
maybe he was working
with someone on the inside.

12:30.510 --> 12:34.139
- I know what this is. You never
like any woman that I date.

12:34.180 --> 12:37.308
- That is not true.
- Um, Tabitha, Serena,

12:37.350 --> 12:40.057
Kyla.
- Stalker, hoarder,

12:40.090 --> 12:42.513
borderline personality disorder.
- OK, the last one,

12:42.560 --> 12:43.788
I'll give you, but...

12:43.830 --> 12:46.219
Look, Heather had nothing to do
with this. She's a sweet girl,

12:46.260 --> 12:48.797
and her career will be destroyed
if we don't find Galen.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.969
Galen was in Mexico

12:53.000 --> 12:55.059
for a gig. Wouldn't he have had
a trunk filled with magic?

12:55.100 --> 12:57.409
- Tricks. Magic tricks.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.908
- We checked with the airline.
All he brought was carry-on.

12:59.940 --> 13:03.068
- Doesn't that
seem a little weird?
- Maybe he left it in Mexico.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.338
- No. He needs his trunk here;
it's part of his act.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.514
on how we find him.
Look at the size of it.

13:09.550 --> 13:12.087
Probably contains
every trick he has.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.350
- OK, so why don't
you two find the trunk,

13:14.390 --> 13:16.927
and I'll find out how Galen
got access to the paddy wagon.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.928
And I'll prove to you
that Heather's not crazy.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.225
- Sounds good. Oh, wait.
Just in case, don't let
her near the bunny.

13:26.130 --> 13:27.961
Hi there!

13:28.000 --> 13:30.230
I was supposed to pick up
a shipment for my boss,

13:30.270 --> 13:33.137
and I totally forgot.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.172
- Yeah. Yeah. I, uh,
totally should have.

13:36.210 --> 13:39.099
At some point.
- It's a pretty big trunk,

13:39.150 --> 13:41.118
about three
by SIX, decorated

13:41.150 --> 13:43.186
with moons and stars.
Guy's name is Galen Baxter.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.279
- It's not here.
It was claimed earlier today.

13:47.360 --> 13:51.182
- I don't exactly remember.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.036
No.

14:00.070 --> 14:02.937
- All I have is a squiggly

14:02.970 --> 14:05.200
signature. But that trunk
must be something special

14:05.240 --> 14:07.879
to get so much attention.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.273
- Someone else tried
to claim it an hour ago.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.242
Hat, sunglasses.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.248
He seemed really pissed
when it was gone.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.246
And he gave me
a hundred bucks.

14:19.290 --> 14:21.349
- Well, looks like
I just saved 40 bucks.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.283
First, Galen disappears,
now his trunk...

14:25.330 --> 14:28.299
Maybe there's more to this
monkey business than
we're seeing.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.298
Oh, come on,
it was right there.

14:30.330 --> 14:33.128
- Speaking of which, I just got
an email from one of the members

14:33.170 --> 14:35.138
of the archaeology forum
I posted in.

14:35.170 --> 14:38.105
"Omar Torkia."
He's an art collector.

14:38.140 --> 14:40.233
- Let's see what
he has to say.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.546
One espresso, two coffees.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.548
- You know, many people
mistake espresso

14:48.580 --> 14:50.548
with a type of bean

14:50.590 --> 14:53.115
or roast.
But espresso

14:53.160 --> 14:56.379
is actually just the method
by which the coffee is prepared.

14:56.420 --> 14:59.423
So in fact,
we are all having coffee.

14:59.460 --> 15:02.054
- Neat.

15:02.100 --> 15:05.194
Thanks so much for coming in
and talking to us, Mr. Torkia.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.289
- I never pass up
an opportunity

15:07.340 --> 15:09.535
to discuss Mayan artifacts.
- I understand

15:09.570 --> 15:12.107
you're an expert on the topic.
- Specifically

15:12.140 --> 15:15.075
the classic era,
500 to 800 AD.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.305
You know, to the ancient Mayans,

15:17.350 --> 15:20.046
the howler monkeys
were revered as patrons

15:20.080 --> 15:22.378
of the arts.
- Huh.

15:22.420 --> 15:26.140
Uh, what would something
like this go for?

15:26.190 --> 15:29.057
- Oh-oh...
This is a rare piece.

15:29.090 --> 15:31.183
Part of a set of ten.

15:31.230 --> 15:34.688
"The Stone Monkeys
of Calakmul."

15:34.730 --> 15:38.359
Is this a police matter?
I notice it's_been
tagged as eVIdence.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.368
- We're not at liberty
to discuss that.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.003
- Actually my first time. Been
waiting for the right moment.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.474
- Hahaha! Aaah...

15:47.510 --> 15:50.570
On its own, it's hard
to assess its value.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.544
But as a complete set of ten,

15:52.580 --> 15:54.719
pheww, it would be worth

15:54.750 --> 15:57.548
at least half a million
on the black market.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.717
Antiquities trading is illegal.
Collectors are willing

15:59.750 --> 16:01.980
to pay a hefty premium.
- Here we are.

16:02.020 --> 16:05.080
"The Stone Monkeys of Calakmul."
- Ah yes, yes, yes.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.428
That's them!

16:07.460 --> 16:10.099
- Yes, thank you.

16:14.070 --> 16:16.038
- I'm thinking

16:16.070 --> 16:18.106
Galen got arrested
with one monkey to distract

16:18.140 --> 16:20.506
from the fact that he had
nine more in his trunk.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.599
- Which he shipped in separately
and which he had someone else

16:22.640 --> 16:25.143
pick up for him.
- And someone else is after.

16:25.180 --> 16:27.375
Hat and sunglasses
could be the buyer.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.742
- Except he made a monkey
out of him. Ha!

16:30.790 --> 16:32.985
Oh, come on,
it was right there.

16:40.130 --> 16:42.121
What's all this?
- I don't know,

16:42.160 --> 16:44.594
but a guy could die of thirst
waiting for you to get home.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.188
- Maggie called.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.437
She loved our audition!

16:50.710 --> 16:53.804
Wow! OK. Congratulations!

16:53.840 --> 16:56.638
VVhat

16:56.680 --> 16:58.568
- The combination--
- Heh! Heh! Heh!

16:58.610 --> 17:00.077
There we go.
- The combination

17:00.120 --> 17:03.214
of my effervescence
and your former celebrity

17:03.250 --> 17:06.811
was "undeniably electric."
Her words,

17:06.850 --> 17:09.353
darling.
- But we weren't auditioning;

17:09.390 --> 17:11.381
we were fighting!
- Potato, potahto.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.398
Maggie talked
to her bosses,

17:13.430 --> 17:15.398
and she pitched them
a whole new idea for a show.

17:15.430 --> 17:17.421
Instead of Breakfast with Becca,

17:17.470 --> 17:20.496
it's going to be
Exes for Breakfast!

17:20.540 --> 17:23.236
- Haha!

17:23.270 --> 17:25.738
Um, I already have a job.
- Are you telling me you'd

17:25.770 --> 17:28.102
rather choose going through
someone's trash than doing this?

17:28.140 --> 17:30.404
- That is not what I do!

17:30.450 --> 17:33.476
All the time.
- This would be our own show.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.375
Our_ faces would be
on millions of TV screens.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.344
And we get to go
to all the best parties.

17:41.260 --> 17:44.229
Check out the offer.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.169
Yeah, I knew
you'd see it my way.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.088
OK, we have a meeting
with Maggie tomorrow

17:52.130 --> 17:54.394
to discuss all the details.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.136
I need to plan an outfit.

17:57.170 --> 18:00.230
Co-hosts! Hee! Hahaha!

18:08.380 --> 18:11.110
- So, not celebrating.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.879
- Lay off, Dad.
- No, if you don't want

18:12.920 --> 18:15.115
to do it, just tell her.
- Did you see how excited

18:15.160 --> 18:17.185
she was? I don't want to burst
her bubble like that.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.152
- Pretty tempting though.

18:19.190 --> 18:21.556
The parties, the fame,
the cash...

18:21.600 --> 18:23.261
- I'm not that guy
any more, Dad.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.189
- Maybe you should
tell Becca that.

18:36.910 --> 18:38.901
- I was lying in bed
thinking about the case--

18:38.950 --> 18:40.815
- I like where this is going
so far.

18:40.850 --> 18:43.648
- I found something.
I just sent you the link.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.648
- OK, hold on a sec.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.555
- And now_ _
for my Signature illu5ion

18:48.590 --> 18:50.626
I call Edison's Dream.
I need everyone

18:50.660 --> 18:53.151
to be very, very quiet.

18:59.730 --> 19:02.460
- The Amazing Dwight
is an amazing liar.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.208
Hey, Dwight!
- Oh, hey!

19:06.240 --> 19:08.208
You guys want
to see another trick?

19:08.240 --> 19:09.730
- Maybe there's one of Galen's
you want to show us.

19:09.780 --> 19:12.305
- You can steal a man's trunk,
but not his talent.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.215
- I didn't steal
anything, so...

19:14.250 --> 19:16.878
- So it's just a coincidence
you're performing Galen's
signature trick?

19:16.920 --> 19:19.684
- I stole that, sure,
yeah, great,

19:19.720 --> 19:22.587
but it's not what you think.
Galen called me from Mexico.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.884
He asked me to pick up
his trunk for him on the QT.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.955
- I don't know.

19:26.990 --> 19:29.595
He just asked me to keep it here
until he shows up.

19:29.630 --> 19:31.564
- And in the meantime,
you got greedy.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.898
- I just thought if I could
master one good trick,

19:33.940 --> 19:35.896
I could finally have
a show of my own.

19:35.940 --> 19:38.568
- That thing is a gold mine.

19:38.610 --> 19:41.670
OK? There's like this shrinking
coin trick. You stick it

19:41.710 --> 19:43.678
in your ear and then--
- Just show it to us.

19:43.710 --> 19:45.405
- OK, yeah.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.359
- I don't see anything.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.402
- Let's get it back
to the agency.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.408
Tell Galen if he wants it,
he can pick it up there.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.908
- Hold on.

20:15.940 --> 20:19.000
There's a secret compartment.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.268
- Just big enough to hide
nine stone monkeys.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.917
- Or a bunch
of little red pills.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.655
- Whoa.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.561
OK, here we go: Acedrox.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.693
Says here it's an experimental
drug that hasn't been

20:40.740 --> 20:43.038
approved yet in Canada.
Used in the treatment

20:43.070 --> 20:46.335
of cardiac angiosarcoma,
a rare form of cancer.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.634
- I can't imagine
an experimental drug that treats

20:48.680 --> 20:50.671
an incredibly rare disease
has much street value.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.701
- Why does Galen have
a trunk full of it?

20:54.350 --> 20:57.319
Your dad's old office?
- Where else are we gonna
put it?

20:57.350 --> 20:59.910
- I'm not even allowed
to go in there.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.009
You're the boss.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.691
- Watch out for the--

21:11.400 --> 21:13.493
I meant to tell you.
I'm throwing a poker game

21:13.540 --> 21:15.735
in honour of my Dad.
The anniversary of his death

21:15.770 --> 21:19.069
is tomorrow. If you're free...
- Yeah, sure. Wouldn't miss it.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.977
- It's not gonna be fancy.
My dad's idea of a perfect night

21:22.010 --> 21:24.979
is poker, friends, and a bottle
of 16-year-old Lagavulin.

21:25.010 --> 21:27.319
- Sounds like Xanadu.
- 8 o'clock.

21:27.350 --> 21:30.069
And bring lots of cash 'cause
Mama needs a new pair of shoes.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.418
-Hmmm

21:32.450 --> 21:35.010
Ah, hope I'm not interrupting.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.016
- Did you forget
about our meeting?

21:38.760 --> 21:42.093
The morning show
that I auditioned for
wants to hire us both!

21:42.130 --> 21:44.098
Oh, I'm Becca
by the way.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.859
We haven't met.
- Angie.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.698
Sorry, uh, the...
the "morning show"?

21:48.740 --> 21:52.107
- Well, It's a tremendous
opportunity. I mean, Matt
and I would be co-hosting

21:52.140 --> 21:55.029
together. Broadcast live
on 16 affiliate stations.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.548
- Wow! Congratulations.

21:57.580 --> 22:00.071
- Nothing's been decided yet.
It wasn't even an audition.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.078
- Yeah, but our chemistry
was really undeniable.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.486
I mean, they changed the whole
format of the show for it

22:04.520 --> 22:07.114
and everything.
- Right. Good luck with that.

22:07.150 --> 22:10.051
Can you lock up when you
leave? I don't want just
anyone wandering in.

22:10.090 --> 22:12.126
- Angie, wait.
- Matt, we have to go.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.458
- I'll meet you in the car.
- No, but they specified

22:14.500 --> 22:16.491
that we cannot be late because
everyone's gonna be there:

22:16.530 --> 22:18.395
the network and the sponsors,
that woman who does the news

22:18.430 --> 22:20.318
with a bealq nose. Hurry up.
- Yeah, I know. I'll be there.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.938
- Well, that's some emergency

22:26.970 --> 22:30.007
you ran off for yesterday.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.940
They saw us fighting
and came up

22:33.980 --> 22:36.039
But I'm not gonna
take the job.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.480
- She will.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.613
Look, I'm just gonna meet with
the producers to pave the way

22:40.660 --> 22:42.548
for her to host
the show on her own.

22:42.590 --> 22:43.989
Ange, you gotta believe me.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.055
I'll be back in two_hours.
You won't even miss me.

22:46.090 --> 22:48.058
- Wouldn't bring that up
around bonus time.

22:56.170 --> 22:58.934
- So I did some digging.
It turns out Galen worked

22:58.970 --> 23:01.006
for a few days
in the police garage.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.840
He would have had access
to paddy wagons, keys,
uniforms, schedules.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.848
- Well, that's
one mystery solved.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.871
- And one beautiful
woman absolved.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.888
Did you find the trunk?
- Actually, yes.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.888
- Oh, and Galen didn't happen
to be inside, did he?

23:12.920 --> 23:14.956
- No. No. But we did find

23:14.990 --> 23:17.015
a secret compartment
full of pills.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.688
- OK, so first, he's smuggling
artifacts, and now drugs?

23:19.730 --> 23:21.698
We gotta nail this guy.

23:21.730 --> 23:23.698
- It's more complicated
than that!

23:23.730 --> 23:25.698
I mean, the pill's experimental.
It's used to treat

23:25.730 --> 23:27.698
a rare form of cancer.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.561
- Galen didn't
bring it in for kicks. It's
obviously meant for someone.

23:30.610 --> 23:34.034
- Excuse me, are you trying
to make feel sorry for this guy?

23:34.080 --> 23:37.538
Alright, he smuggled contraband.
He escaped police custody.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.207
- Yeah, but it doesn't make
sense. I mean, why wouldn't he

23:39.250 --> 23:41.138
put the monkey in
the compartment with the drugs?

23:41.180 --> 23:42.977
Why would he walk through
customs with it in his pocket?

23:43.020 --> 23:45.944
- I don't know.
- Because he
planned it that way.

23:45.990 --> 23:49.153
He needed someone to believe
that he had been caught.
The question is who?

23:49.190 --> 23:51.522
- Angie, you're supposed
to be helping me.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.723
Not some two-bit magician with
a taste for ancient art and
cutting-edge medicme.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.729
- I'm just trying to figure
out what happened.
- I just asked you

23:57.770 --> 24:01.228
to find the guy who made
my almost-girlfriend look bad.

24:01.270 --> 24:03.534
Look, this is not just
about Heather.

24:03.570 --> 24:05.561
My ass is on the line too.
If it gets out

24:05.610 --> 24:07.805
that I'm helping her before
we get Evil David Copperfield

24:07.840 --> 24:10.229
back in custody, I will lose my
promotion. I could lose my job.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.908
- But I just don't think that--

24:12.950 --> 24:15.714
Just find Galen, please.
That's it.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.088
- And that was the last time
I set foot in Albuquerque.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.156
- Excuse me. Hey, can we
steal you for a minute?

24:24.190 --> 24:27.057
- Yeah. Duty calls. Nice talking
to you guys. Yeah, thank you.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.058
- Oh, you seem
to be enjoying yourself.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.069
- I forgot how much fun
these "meetings" could be.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.489
- So, that's a head of network
over there.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.100
She is a huge fan of yours.

24:37.140 --> 24:40.132
Is she single?
- Easy, cowboy.

24:40.170 --> 24:42.035
- Oh, this is exactly
the kind of banter

24:42.080 --> 24:44.947
that is gonna make
Exes for Breakfast a big hit.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.743
- Yeah, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.816
- OK, listen. I know that
this is moving really fast,

24:48.850 --> 24:51.011
and Becca's told me you have
some concerns, but you have to

24:51.050 --> 24:53.985
trust me when I tell you, Matt,
you're a natural. Charming,

24:54.020 --> 24:56.580
funny and not to mention
this bad-boy allure.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.759
- People like us belong on
camera, babe. Just not married.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.521
- Don't answer yet. I have
a big surprise for you,
and once you see it,

25:02.560 --> 25:04.869
I guarantee you will
change your mind.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.720
And you're waiting right here.
Don't go anywhere!

25:06.770 --> 25:08.738
Stay right there!

25:15.610 --> 25:17.237
- Hey.

25:17.280 --> 25:20.169
I talked to Maz. He says...

25:20.210 --> 25:23.008
- The secret
to good coffee

25:23.050 --> 25:25.917
is a little salt in the grounds.
I made enough

25:25.950 --> 25:29.579
for two. Unless
you want some, Conrad?

25:29.620 --> 25:31.554
- I'm good.

25:31.590 --> 25:34.058
- Mr. Torkia.
What can I do for you?

25:39.870 --> 25:42.338
- I believe you have
something that belongs to me.

25:42.370 --> 25:45.066
- You tried to claim the trunk
at the shipping depot.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.066
Hat and sunglasses.
- Hahaha!

25:47.110 --> 25:48.907
- You know, I had started

25:48.940 --> 25:50.942
to give up hope,

25:50.980 --> 25:52.902
especially when you told me
that the police were involved.

25:52.950 --> 25:55.669
_ But then I met
this young magICIan--

25:55.720 --> 25:58.314
- Dwight.
- That's him. Nice guy.

25:58.350 --> 26:00.614
Unfortunately, when I asked him

26:00.660 --> 26:02.685
about the trunk,
he tried to hold out on me.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.654
Conrad had _
to "conVInce" him

26:04.690 --> 26:06.885
to cooperate.

26:06.930 --> 26:08.295
I hope you'll make it
easier on yourself.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.992
- If you're looking for
the monkeys, I don't have them.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.089
- Don't even joke
about that. I paid Galen

26:13.130 --> 26:15.064
far too much for them.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.034
: No! No!

26:17.070 --> 26:20.779
- You give me what I want or
first Conrad breaks your office,

26:20.810 --> 26:22.801
then he breaks
your bones.

26:22.840 --> 26:26.298
So, one last time,
where's the trunk?

26:28.150 --> 26:30.118
- Haha! Oh, crap!

26:30.150 --> 26:32.118
I gotta go.
Nice to meet you guys.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.982
- Oh no, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.794
Not until you see your surprise.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.752
***

26:42.800 --> 26:45.667
- Becca mentioned you had
a thing for sports cars.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.294
Maybe this might make
your decision a little easier.

26:57.410 --> 27:01.176
Sorry I'm late. I...

27:02.920 --> 27:05.809
What happened

27:05.850 --> 27:08.887
- I got held up at the party.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.150
- Ha! I thought
it was a meeting.

27:11.190 --> 27:14.057
- Omar Torkia happened.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.295
!
- Yeah.

27:16.330 --> 27:19.197
He thinks the monkeys
belong to him. He and his
goon found out that we had

27:19.230 --> 27:22.666
the trunk, so they paid us
a visit. Paid me a visit.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.828
- You're acting like I knew
this was gonna happen.

27:25.870 --> 27:29.169
- Maybe if you would have been
here, it wouldn't have.

27:29.210 --> 27:31.144
- You're the one out playing Ken
and Barbie with your ex-wife!

27:31.180 --> 27:33.148
- Becca had nothing
to do with this!

27:33.180 --> 27:35.375
- I don't care about Becca.
I care about this business,

27:35.420 --> 27:37.342
and whether or not,
you want to be part of it.

27:37.380 --> 27:40.383
- Look, my thing went longer
than I planned. Give me a break!

27:40.420 --> 27:43.309
- I already did! I gave you
a job when you had nothing else.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.181
_-_Which I've been
auditioning for ever Since.

27:46.230 --> 27:48.198
They offered me a job
within five minutes!

27:48.230 --> 27:50.391
- Hard to resist
for a shortcut guy.

27:50.430 --> 27:52.990
- Oh. So now we're back here.

27:53.030 --> 27:55.032
Angie Everett's
people-never-change theory.

27:55.070 --> 27:58.198
- Call 'em like I see 'em.
- No. You see what
you wanna see.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.902
No matter what, I'll never be
good enough for you

28:00.940 --> 28:02.771
because I'll never be your dad.

28:07.150 --> 28:09.812
- You obviously want
to take the other job,

28:09.850 --> 28:12.842
so I'll make it easy for you.
You're fired.

28:14.120 --> 28:17.089
- Don't do me any favours.
I quit.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.782
- Good! Get out of here!

28:29.070 --> 28:31.300
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

28:31.340 --> 28:34.309
She said she needed to be at the
studio early because she told
them that she was a "winter,"

28:34.340 --> 28:36.308
but the samples that they sent
were for an "autumn."

28:36.340 --> 28:39.798
- I was hoping to get her
to help me pick out a tie.

28:39.850 --> 28:41.772
- So you're really
doing this, huh?

28:41.820 --> 28:43.742
- Sure.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.314
Why?

28:45.350 --> 28:47.341
- I-I thought
you liked being a P.I.

28:47.390 --> 28:49.358
-Ido.

28:49.390 --> 28:52.518
I mean, I did.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.154
It's a great opportunity
for your mom, honey.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.122
For both of us.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.264
For Ellard?

28:59.300 --> 29:01.837
- Your school fees have
nothing to do with this.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.031
- Look, if this is
what you want to do, then great.

29:04.070 --> 29:06.038
But all I know is
it didn't work out

29:06.070 --> 29:08.277
so well last time when you were
constantly fighting with Mom.

29:08.310 --> 29:10.870
***

29:15.480 --> 29:18.813
- I'm saying I'm a little
surprised we're shooting
the camera test already.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.818
- Ah, the network was
so thrilled that you're taking

29:20.860 --> 29:23.055
the next step, they wanted
to test it right away.

29:23.090 --> 29:25.024
Trust me, this is a good thing.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.028
Here you go. OK?

29:29.200 --> 29:31.225
- Hey.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.261
- Yeah.

29:33.300 --> 29:37.168
Have you seen this? Seems
a little negative.
- Come on,

29:37.200 --> 29:39.031
when you were a sportscaster,
didn't you want to say

29:39.070 --> 29:40.935
Gilmour couldn't make ice
Without a mum?

29:40.980 --> 29:44.848
- Well, yeah, but that was
a long time ago. What's Jules

29:44.880 --> 29:47.098
gonna think of this?
- Don't screw this up for me,

29:47.150 --> 29:50.074
alright, Matt? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm just...

29:50.120 --> 29:52.816
I'm stressed out. This is
a big opportunity for me.

29:52.850 --> 29:55.978
For both of us.
- I just think
we should tone it down.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.988
- Well, I think
it just reads negative.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.897
You know, picture saying it
with a little wink and a smile.

30:00.930 --> 30:03.455
Give it some of that trademark
Matt Shade magic.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.491
Look, just be yourself.

30:05.530 --> 30:08.090
You'll be fine.
- Alright.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.234
Exes For Breakfast
camera test, take one.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.101
And...

30:13.140 --> 30:15.472
action!
- Hi, I'm Becca D'Orsay.

30:15.510 --> 30:17.501
And this is my ex-husband,
Matt Shade.

30:17.540 --> 30:20.077
You know him as a hockey player.
- And you know her

30:20.110 --> 30:23.147
as the woman who took
half my money in the divorce.

30:23.180 --> 30:25.148
- If you want to find out
why I deserved

30:25.190 --> 30:27.579
all that money and more,
join us for...

30:27.620 --> 30:30.783
Exes For Breakfast!
- OK. Cut!

30:34.660 --> 30:36.457
OK. That was great.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.967
Really great.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.195
But I'm gonna need you
to say that last line

30:40.230 --> 30:43.495
together. Remember?
- Yeah, right. Sorry about that.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.532
- Hey, come here.
Let's have a little talk.

30:48.210 --> 30:50.599
Listen.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.370
I get it. It's weird
working with your ex.

30:53.410 --> 30:56.379
You don't gotta tell me.
That's my ex right over there.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.458
You guys are partners now, OK?

31:01.490 --> 31:04.186
So you're gonna have to commit
or else this thing,

31:04.230 --> 31:07.085
it's not gonna work.
And if you can't commit,

31:07.130 --> 31:09.894
fake it. Alright? Alright.

31:09.930 --> 31:12.228
Shall we try this again? OK!

31:16.400 --> 31:18.368
- Good as new.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.436
Considering my dad picked it up
off the curb in the first place.

31:21.480 --> 31:25.109
Hey. Hey, hey. Leave some dust.
Clients won't take me seriously.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.402
- You're the one who_ needs
to be taking this seriously.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.372
Who the hell
were these guys?

31:29.420 --> 31:33.015
- It doesn't matter. They wanted
the trunk; they got the trunk.
End of story.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.415
- And where was Shade
during all this?

31:34.460 --> 31:36.416
- It's just as well
Shade wasn't here. He would've

31:36.460 --> 31:39.349
just tried to be the hero and
made everything worse.
- Must have been

31:39.390 --> 31:41.551
some fight to make you go back
to being a lone wolf.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.423
- One fight broke up
a partnership.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.529
- I gotta go.

31:49.570 --> 31:52.107
I think one of my witnesses
is lying to me.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.404
***

31:59.150 --> 32:00.970
What are you doing here?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.045
- I had a thought
about Donatella.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.116
- Very funny.

32:05.150 --> 32:08.449
I was thinking that her
and Galen are still partners,
that they faked their breakup.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.685
- I had the same thought.
It seemed odd

32:10.720 --> 32:13.223
that one fight could break
two people up like that.

32:15.260 --> 32:17.251
- So I guess one of us
should go talk to her.

32:19.230 --> 32:22.267
- You can come in, but it
doesn't change anything.
- I didn't say it did.

32:25.510 --> 32:29.037
- I already told you, I don't
know where Galen is.
- Come on, Donatella!

32:29.080 --> 32:31.674
He's in trouble. You need
to tell us how to find him.

32:31.710 --> 32:33.678
- So you can turn him over
to the police?

32:33.710 --> 32:36.213
- Better that than Torkia
catching up to him.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.138
- Galen can take care
of himself.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.114
: You know, some woman's
gonna lose her job over
this, right?

32:41.160 --> 32:43.185
- It's not my problem.
- No.

32:43.220 --> 32:46.121
Your problem
is that you've run out of meds.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.152
You're the one with the cancer.
That's why you stopped
performing.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.761
- I don't know
what you're talking about.
- I read about Acedrox online.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.291
If you don't maintain the dose,
it loses its effectiveness.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.160
That's why Galen
had to go every month.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.339
That's why he was trying to get
a big supply, so you wouldn't

32:59.370 --> 33:02.032
run out. That's why
you pretended to be broken up.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.207
- Get out of my house!
- Let us help.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.048
Tell us how we can find him.
We'll figure out some solution.

33:07.080 --> 33:11.289
Smuggle in
the drugs yourself?

33:11.320 --> 33:14.585
And what is the point of living
if you don't have a partner?

33:14.620 --> 33:17.214
- That's enough!
Leave her alone!

33:17.260 --> 33:19.148
: Baby, no!

33:19.190 --> 33:21.055
- It's OK.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.297
She has nothing
to do with this.

33:24.330 --> 33:26.366
I'm the one you want.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.100
How much do you know?

33:32.140 --> 33:35.473
- Almost all of it.
You can fill in the blanks.

33:35.510 --> 33:38.775
- Torkia approached me
after one of my shows,

33:38.810 --> 33:41.813
offered me a cut
of the 500 grand

33:41.850 --> 33:43.647
ifI brought the monkeys
back for him.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.319
- I'd been going back and forth

33:46.350 --> 33:50.059
to Mexico for a year, but
between the cost of the drugs,

33:50.090 --> 33:52.684
the flights, we just...

33:52.730 --> 33:55.449
we couldn't keep up.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.163
I thought of all the good
that money could do.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.566
- So you used it
to buy meds instead.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.591
- I know it was wrong.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.168
But I would have
done anything to save her.

34:09.210 --> 34:11.098
- It's OK.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.549
- But what about
the paddy wagon?

34:12.580 --> 34:14.548
How did you know
which one would come?

34:14.580 --> 34:17.174
- They use a paddy wagon
for hospital pickups

34:17.220 --> 34:19.188
in case there's a wheelchair.

34:19.220 --> 34:21.188
I memorized the schedule
before I left.

34:21.220 --> 34:23.552
- And then broke your wrist
to seal the deal.

34:23.590 --> 34:25.319
- Are you going
to turn him in?

34:25.360 --> 34:27.157
- We kind of have to.

34:33.270 --> 34:35.238
I'm sorry, babe.

34:35.270 --> 34:37.261
I tried. I'm sorry.

34:43.310 --> 34:45.505
- Can we tell Mazhari
we couldn't find him?

34:45.550 --> 34:47.506
- He's got too much
riding on this.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.218
- But by now, Torkia
has probably figured out

34:51.250 --> 34:53.514
there are no monkeys in that
trunk, so maybe we can convince

34:53.550 --> 34:55.518
him to give the drugs back.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.723
You got an extra 500 grand
kicking around?

34:58.760 --> 35:01.695
_- We'll have to use
a little magic of our own.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.792
- Welcome to the Magic House.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.138
- I must say,
I didn't know

35:13.170 --> 35:15.206
you were such grandstanders.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.676
People rarely surprise me.
- Then you're gonna love this.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.141
: What's he doing here?
- I'm here to repay my debt.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.589
- Speaking of which,
where's my money?

35:25.620 --> 35:27.508
- Not so fast.
Let's see the drugs.

35:32.660 --> 35:35.823
- Actually, we brought something
you might prefer.

35:39.530 --> 35:41.794
- I thought that was locked up
in police evidence.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.432
- We've got friends
on the inside.

35:43.470 --> 35:45.358
- Let me _see!
- Drugs first.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.747
- Ohhh...

35:58.790 --> 36:00.815
Ohhh, it's beautiful!

36:03.520 --> 36:05.488
- You must be joking.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.350
This is no good
without the entire set.

36:07.390 --> 36:10.553
- But you know
I don't have the others.
- I'll just take the drugs back.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.522
- Oh, give me a break.
They're worthless to you.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.198
- Now hand over that case!

36:15.240 --> 36:17.299
- Can't say we didn't try.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.904
- That wouldn't happen to be an
illegal antiquity in your hand

36:22.940 --> 36:25.374
now, would it?

36:26.350 --> 36:27.908
- Ta-da!

36:36.590 --> 36:38.649
- Hey, Bentworth!
I gotta tell you

36:38.690 --> 36:40.681
this turned out pretty great.
And your man Galen's

36:40.730 --> 36:42.789
gonna confess?
The escape, the smuggling,

36:42.830 --> 36:44.593
everything?
Whatever it takes.

36:44.630 --> 36:46.996
- This is like Christmas.
First, Torkia and his goon,

36:47.030 --> 36:48.998
and now the Magic Man himself.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.600
- Good thing we got
that monkey off your back.

36:51.640 --> 36:55.303
- Yeah... I'm gonna
call down to booking.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.228
I'll get a selfie with him
and send it to Heather.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.248
- So that's
your idea of foreplay.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.316
***
Disturbing.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.272
- Hey, hey, hey,
aren't you forgetting something?

37:03.320 --> 37:05.481
The meds.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.580
- Yeah, right.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.264
So you'll give
the pills to Donatella?

37:23.300 --> 37:24.858
Send her my best?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.764
- Yeah. I will.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.278
- You and me.

37:32.310 --> 37:35.017
- Nothing happens
because you quit.
- Only because you fired me.

37:35.050 --> 37:37.348
- Well, I fired you
because you got another job.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.814
- I only got another job
because I didn't have
the first one anymore.

37:39.850 --> 37:41.715
- If you had been at the first
one, you wouldn't have been

37:41.760 --> 37:43.751
in a position to be offered the
second job in the first place!

37:47.760 --> 37:49.751
This is goodbye?

37:49.800 --> 37:51.620
- I guess it is.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.797
- Well, I guess
I should leave.

37:53.830 --> 37:56.537
- I guess you should.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.885
- This is my ex-husband,
Matt Shade:

38:11.920 --> 38:14.809
former hockey player,
lifetime screw-up.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.078
- And this is my ex-wife,
Becca D'Orsay:

38:17.120 --> 38:19.759
former weather girl,
lifetime nag.

38:19.790 --> 38:22.588
- Join us every morning
at 9 am. where we put

38:22.630 --> 38:26.760
the "fun" in dysfunction on...
: Exes For Breakfast!

38:26.800 --> 38:29.860
***

38:29.900 --> 38:33.028
- Oh, it's you. You scared me!

38:33.070 --> 38:36.073
- Sorry. I left
my cowbell downstairs.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.948
- Wow, that doesn't look
like much fun.

38:41.980 --> 38:45.609
- These were the early takes.
The later ones are much better.

38:46.990 --> 38:49.413
- You know, Becca,

38:49.460 --> 38:51.587
I know how much you want this.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.586
And God knows you deserve it.

38:53.630 --> 38:56.519
You more than paid your dues
on that weather-girl gig.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.991
And if you insist,

39:01.030 --> 39:03.999
Matt will do it.
***

39:04.040 --> 39:06.008
But maybe you should think
about why

39:06.040 --> 39:08.600
you turned that video off
when you heard me coming.

39:11.180 --> 39:13.808
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Matt.

39:24.090 --> 39:27.719
- It was, uh...
It was fine.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.796
Listen,

39:29.830 --> 39:31.593
we need to talk.

39:33.970 --> 39:36.063
About the show.
I need to say

39:36.100 --> 39:38.500
something first. Um...

39:38.540 --> 39:41.168
I've been thinking, and

39:41.210 --> 39:43.872
I'm gonna turn down
Exes For Breakfast.

39:43.910 --> 39:46.845
- Yeah.

39:46.880 --> 39:50.043
I don't like the way
they're portraying us. You know,

39:50.080 --> 39:52.184
the nagging ex-wife
and the boorish ex-husband.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.188
What will Jules think?

39:54.220 --> 39:56.916
- Well, you make
some valid points.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.054
- And of course,
if they can't have me,
then they won't want you.

40:00.090 --> 40:03.059
- No, of course they won't.
- So...

40:03.100 --> 40:06.160
- But I feel bad about you
missing your opportunity.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.191
- Oh, well, I thought

40:08.230 --> 40:10.562
that I might have a casual
conversation with Maggie

40:10.600 --> 40:13.831
and see if they're still
interested in the whole
solo host thing.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.907
If that's OK with you.
- They'd be luclq to have you.

40:16.940 --> 40:19.044
- And maybe it's better
that we don't work together.

40:19.080 --> 40:23.073
You know, in case
we ever wanted to, um...

40:27.220 --> 40:30.553
- Listen, that was
a really nice illusion,

40:30.590 --> 40:34.082
but I don't think we should
let ourselves be fooled by it.

40:34.130 --> 40:36.098
- Yeah.

40:36.130 --> 40:37.995
Ha! Ha!

40:38.030 --> 40:40.191
Speaking of fools,
do you want

40:40.230 --> 40:42.767
to watch our camera test?
I could make some popcorn.

40:44.070 --> 40:47.164
- Actually, um...

40:47.210 --> 40:50.008
there's somewhere I need to be.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.144
- Won't you quit

40:52.180 --> 40:54.171
sexting long enough to play
the poker game, you know?

40:54.210 --> 40:56.610
- I'm doing both.
Thank you very much.

40:56.650 --> 40:58.618
- You hardly have enough
for a small blind. After that,

40:58.650 --> 41:00.242
you're gonna have to start
throwing clothing into the pot.

41:00.290 --> 41:03.657
- See now, that's intriguing.
- Great. Now he's gonna start
losing on purpose.

41:03.690 --> 41:05.578
You mean
that wasn't on purpose?

41:05.630 --> 41:07.257
- Hey, bring it on. I'm wearing
four pairs of underwear.

41:13.230 --> 41:15.232
- Oh, isn't it the man
who screwed me out

41:15.270 --> 41:17.192
of a drug bust today.
Nice work, Houdini.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.099
What? Too soon.

41:21.140 --> 41:23.131
- You need me
to do something here?

41:24.980 --> 41:28.040
Let's go get a drink, man.
- I have a drink. I wanna see

41:28.080 --> 41:31.174
how this all plays out.
- Now, Mazhari.

41:33.150 --> 41:36.688
- * All I ask is why

41:36.720 --> 41:38.824
- Brought this but it looks like
you've got everything covered.

41:38.860 --> 41:41.078
- Always good
to have an extra bottle.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.189
- * Please don't go

41:43.230 --> 41:48.190
* Outside

41:50.240 --> 41:52.162
- I've got money.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.166
- Thanks to your new TV job.

41:54.210 --> 41:56.804
- Actually, I quit.

41:56.840 --> 42:00.276
- Seems to be a theme with you.

42:00.310 --> 42:03.279
What are you
gonna do for a job?
- I was thinking of talking

42:03.320 --> 42:07.211
to my ex-employer, see if she
was willing to bring me back on.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.229
- In.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.655
All in.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.934
- It's all I got.

42:21.970 --> 42:25.030
- I don't think
that's a very good bet.

42:29.310 --> 42:32.245
You win? I walk
out of here forever.

42:32.280 --> 42:35.215
I win? You hire me back.

42:36.950 --> 42:37.939
- Call.

42:49.060 --> 42:51.119
Oof, this isn't looking
very good

42:51.160 --> 42:53.094
for you.

42:56.270 --> 42:58.090
Even worse.

42:58.140 --> 43:01.200
***
- I know you're upset.

43:01.240 --> 43:04.903
But I'm done disappearing.

43:04.950 --> 43:06.577
We're a two-person act...

43:08.280 --> 43:10.771
...and we both know it.

43:18.790 --> 43:21.156
- Let's start a new game.

43:23.160 --> 43:26.664
- OK.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.258
***

43:28.300 --> 43:30.689
- I'm gonna take all your money.
You better get a drink.
