00:15.136 --> 00:18.588
- I felt like somebody was
pulling me across the bed.

00:18.623 --> 00:22.040
- My daughter disappeared
when she was eight years old.

00:22.075 --> 00:24.751
- Before my brother went
missing, he used to see

00:24.786 --> 00:25.715
a shadow person.

00:25.750 --> 00:30.750
- They even move objects, flip
the lights on and off too.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.930
- When I was little I
would see them passing

00:33.965 --> 00:35.405
through the walls at night.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.223
- I felt this cold
sensation just touching me.

00:41.140 --> 00:44.755
- He described it as being a
man, with no features at all,

00:44.790 --> 00:46.672
just dark solid entity.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.550
- Sometimes when I'm sleeping
I get this odd sensation

00:51.585 --> 00:55.110
that wakes me and
they're there waiting me.

00:55.970 --> 00:58.890
- I didn't know exactly what was going on.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.512
- And it got to the
point where I don't even

01:01.547 --> 01:04.099
open my eyes if I wake
up, just because I know

01:04.135 --> 01:04.935
that they're there.

01:04.970 --> 01:07.532
- I will never, ever
forget this experience

01:07.567 --> 01:09.622
as long as I live.

01:09.657 --> 01:11.470
- What I think she was seeing

01:15.039 --> 01:16.539
was shadow people.

01:30.317 --> 01:31.115
Right now we're tracking

01:31.150 --> 01:33.770
new developments in the search
for three missing people

01:33.805 --> 01:35.923
and earlier today
investigators located a car

01:35.958 --> 01:37.625
connected to this case.

01:37.660 --> 01:38.525
We're tracking the search

01:38.560 --> 01:41.030
this afternoon for three
people who are missing.

01:41.065 --> 01:42.370
- Now these
are people who just vanished

01:42.405 --> 01:43.535
disappeared without a trace.

01:43.570 --> 01:44.595
Investigators announced today

01:44.630 --> 01:46.575
they are no longer actively searching

01:46.610 --> 01:49.291
for missing 23-year-old
woman, but that doesn't mean

01:49.326 --> 01:50.272
the investigation is over.

01:50.307 --> 01:51.740
State officials spend much

01:52.771 --> 01:53.980
of last week investigating
a missing persons case

01:54.015 --> 01:55.145
and now they say-

01:55.180 --> 01:57.510
- The
23-year-old woman has not been

01:57.545 --> 01:59.297
seen since Sunday, her family and police

01:59.332 --> 02:01.015
are asking for your help in finding her.

02:01.050 --> 02:02.895
- The vehicle
of three missing students

02:02.930 --> 02:05.192
was found at an abandoned
mine was earlier today.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.493
Still under investigation.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.685
Why you got so much shit?

02:23.720 --> 02:25.520
- This is actually a small suitcase.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.490
- Is it all
feminine product and shit?

02:28.525 --> 02:29.675
- You know it.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.375
Jesus Christ.

02:31.410 --> 02:32.850
- See it fits.

02:32.885 --> 02:34.255
I guess.

02:34.290 --> 02:37.930
So what frame rate and
shit do you wanna shoot in?

02:37.965 --> 02:38.925
- Frame rate?
- Yeah.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.423
- I don't know, technical
stuff that's all you.

02:42.978 --> 02:46.150
I'm gonna be the one that's
asking at the questions though.

02:46.185 --> 02:47.663
Right, well.

02:48.700 --> 02:49.498
- That stuff-

02:49.533 --> 02:50.507
- You just want me
to run with it and do it?

02:50.542 --> 02:51.305
- Hmm-mm.

02:51.340 --> 02:52.770
- What if you don't
like it when I'm done.

02:52.805 --> 02:54.165
You're like, oh you should have do this.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.615
And I'm like, but you didn't
fucking tell me to do that.

02:57.650 --> 03:01.030
- I mean we'll just roll
with it, what we'll go over.

03:02.670 --> 03:04.890
- You're setting
me up for failure, Sarah.

03:04.925 --> 03:07.231
Come on dude, you gotta fucking hurry.

03:07.266 --> 03:09.537
Joe's gonna be here like any minute dude.

03:09.572 --> 03:10.605
Come on.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.655
You ready?
- Yeah.

03:11.690 --> 03:12.920
- You sure?
- Yeah.

03:12.955 --> 03:14.567
- So this is it?
- Yes.

03:14.602 --> 03:16.144
We're doing it.

03:16.179 --> 03:19.035
You should like, you
know, introduce yourself

03:19.070 --> 03:22.110
and tell people what the
fuck you're doing, right?

03:22.145 --> 03:23.555
- Introduce myself?

03:23.590 --> 03:25.810
- Yeah man, you gotta
set it up and you know.

03:25.845 --> 03:27.373
This is your documentary.

03:28.350 --> 03:29.301
- Okay.

03:29.336 --> 03:30.218
Ready?

03:30.253 --> 03:31.086
Yeah.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.480
- Hi, my name is Sarah
McCormick and my crew and I

03:35.515 --> 03:36.993
are going on a quest.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.040
Actually, don't do that.

03:40.075 --> 03:40.873
Okay.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.080
Hi, my name is Sarah
McCormick, and me and my crew

03:44.115 --> 03:47.895
are going on an adventure to find out more

03:47.930 --> 03:50.850
about the shadow people, and
we're going to be interviewing

03:50.885 --> 03:51.655
a couple of.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.488
Can you do it again?

03:52.523 --> 03:53.356
Adventure's not right either,

03:53.391 --> 03:54.342
that didn't sound right.

03:54.377 --> 03:55.438
That doesn't sound right.

03:55.473 --> 03:56.465
- I should write it down.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.888
- Come on, you don't
have to write this shit down.

03:57.923 --> 03:58.721
- Do we have to do this now?

03:58.756 --> 03:59.665
Can we wait til later?

03:59.700 --> 04:02.043
No, come on Sarah.

04:03.030 --> 04:03.930
Hurry the fuck up.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.450
You've got something in your eat.

04:06.485 --> 04:07.283
- I do?

04:08.750 --> 04:09.850
All right, you ready?

04:09.885 --> 04:10.915
All right, here we go.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.380
- Hi, my name is Sarah
McCormick, and me and my crew

04:13.415 --> 04:15.259
are going on an ad-

04:16.091 --> 04:17.885
- You suck, all
right, you're writing this.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.683
What's up, bro?

04:18.718 --> 04:20.468
- Hey.
- How you doing, man.

04:20.503 --> 04:21.266
- Good.

04:21.301 --> 04:22.099
Good to see ya, good to see ya.

04:22.134 --> 04:24.295
- Get the fucking camera out
of my face.

04:24.330 --> 04:27.100
- You can go and put
this shit in the car, man.

04:28.410 --> 04:31.425
Check one, two, check one, two.

04:31.460 --> 04:34.270
Guys I don't know which
one I want to go with.

04:34.305 --> 04:36.228
I either want to go with this boom.

04:36.263 --> 04:37.026
Pick one.

04:37.061 --> 04:39.235
Or with this stereo application.

04:39.270 --> 04:41.283
We are switching back and forth between.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.560
Okay there's definitely
a lot more road noise

04:48.595 --> 04:50.005
on the stereo I think.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.030
If I go to the boom, it's
gonna isolate our vocals,

04:54.065 --> 04:55.972
our dialogue better.

04:56.007 --> 04:58.400
- All right, why would
you have a dream catcher?

04:58.435 --> 05:00.545
Why is there a wolf on your chest?

05:00.580 --> 05:03.090
Why do you have a wolf
tattooed on your chest,

05:03.125 --> 05:04.650
glaring over the mountains?

05:04.685 --> 05:05.694
- No regrets.

05:08.780 --> 05:12.505
- It's an American wolf
coming out of the mountains

05:12.540 --> 05:16.281
'cause me and my daddy, we
like to hunt, we go hunting

05:16.316 --> 05:20.023
and I got a plate of fucking
American jerky werewolf.

05:22.039 --> 05:23.035
- You've got a tattoo on your butt?

05:23.070 --> 05:25.830
- Yeah, and God-dammit
it, it's a God-damn wolf.

05:25.865 --> 05:26.722
- Shut the, no!

05:26.757 --> 05:29.910
- It's the God-damn
American jerky werewolf

05:29.945 --> 05:32.369
surrounded by dream catchers.

05:32.404 --> 05:34.228
- What was your inspiration for that?

05:34.263 --> 05:36.300
- Didn't you ever see
Pee Wee's Big Adventure?

05:36.335 --> 05:37.712
Are you fucking serious?

05:37.747 --> 05:39.670
- Didn't he get
caught for masturbating.

05:39.705 --> 05:40.504
- Hell, yes he did.

05:41.337 --> 05:43.276
- Can't he just
watch that shit at home

05:43.311 --> 05:45.215
like everybody else on their computer?

05:45.250 --> 05:46.013
- That's what I'm saying.

05:46.048 --> 05:47.085
He never porned nubby?

05:47.120 --> 05:49.855
He never jerked off the nubby porn?

05:49.890 --> 05:51.670
- Oh you mean where they have amputated?

05:51.705 --> 05:53.745
That's right, Joseph.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.825
That's right, these are
women who have no legs.

05:56.860 --> 05:59.870
And they are getting burned
out by motherfuckers.

05:59.905 --> 06:01.315
- Oh in the Lion King I used

06:01.350 --> 06:03.237
to actually have a crush on Mufasa.

06:04.119 --> 06:06.958
- I can't knock to
that, Mufasa's bad-ass.

06:06.993 --> 06:07.756
I'd fucking do him.

06:07.791 --> 06:10.275
- I saw both of
them and I was like ah, man.

06:10.310 --> 06:12.192
- Everyone fuck Mufasa.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.315
Just do your maps.

06:15.350 --> 06:16.560
- That's what I'm doing.

06:16.595 --> 06:17.770
- You have an iPhone right?

06:17.805 --> 06:18.725
- Yeah.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.761
- It's barely hanging on there.

06:20.796 --> 06:23.115
It looks like it's been through
fucking two Robocall movies.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.723
You should have seen that movie.

06:24.758 --> 06:25.970
- I love that movie.

06:26.005 --> 06:26.768
You know what?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.462
That is one of my
favorite all-time movies.

06:29.497 --> 06:30.831
- It is one of the
best movies ever made.

06:30.866 --> 06:31.925
- I don't get a fuck.

06:31.960 --> 06:35.640
I'll buy that for a dollar.

06:35.675 --> 06:36.535
- What are you doing?

06:36.570 --> 06:37.500
Man I love that movie.

06:37.535 --> 06:38.430
- Just type it in.

06:38.465 --> 06:39.945
- I did.

06:39.980 --> 06:42.915
- Okay then, will you zoom out

06:42.950 --> 06:45.050
because there's a part where it says turn.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.740
Like go to the.

06:50.980 --> 06:53.060
THere's a part where we need to turn off.

06:53.095 --> 06:53.895
But where?

06:53.930 --> 06:54.880
- That little nick.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.620
Yeah, what's that say?

06:59.454 --> 07:01.200
Just tell me the road, 'cause
I know how to get there.

07:01.235 --> 07:02.033
All I need to know is the road.

07:02.068 --> 07:02.835
- Three 38.

07:02.870 --> 07:03.955
Oh, look a flea market.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.380
- I used to think flea markets had fleas.

07:06.415 --> 07:08.632
See, we're like two miles to 258.

07:08.667 --> 07:09.553
- Two miles.

07:11.424 --> 07:14.157
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I knew we were close.

07:14.192 --> 07:16.890
- What was your point
with this tree thing?

07:16.925 --> 07:18.135
- It's a good shot.

07:18.170 --> 07:21.704
The B roll shot. You know
the B roll things, right?

07:21.739 --> 07:25.239
When you see the camera
out the windows in a movie

07:25.840 --> 07:27.755
so that you know they're driving

07:27.790 --> 07:31.830
and then it just B roll so
it's just the trees and shit.

07:31.865 --> 07:33.570
I played banjo when I was a kid.

07:33.605 --> 07:34.368
Turn right on.

07:34.403 --> 07:35.201
What made you stop?

07:35.236 --> 07:36.972
I used to give lessons.

07:37.007 --> 07:38.331
Turn right, turn right.

07:38.366 --> 07:39.429
You mean stop?

07:39.464 --> 07:40.493
Yeah.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.310
- My mother was killed
right in front of me

07:50.260 --> 07:53.344
and I had to go to a
psychiatric institution

07:53.379 --> 07:56.428
until I was 15 from the
age of eight until 15

07:56.463 --> 07:58.098
'cause I didn't talk.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.698
- Are you serious?

07:59.733 --> 08:01.786
Joe, stop fucking around dude.

08:01.821 --> 08:03.840
Do tell her shit like that.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.205
That's such a lie.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.035
His mother is alive and well.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.495
He's never been to a psychiatric place.

08:08.530 --> 08:09.293
- You're an asshole.

08:09.328 --> 08:10.161
- Well, he's probably
been to a psychiatric hospital.

08:10.196 --> 08:11.065
- Why am I an asshole?

08:11.100 --> 08:13.392
- 'Cause I was about to get emotional.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.088
Oh Sarah.

08:15.123 --> 08:16.402
It's okay.

08:16.437 --> 08:17.646
Ouch, shit.

08:17.681 --> 08:19.116
Don't you fucking touch her

08:19.151 --> 08:20.551
after I fucking insulted her.

08:36.179 --> 08:43.005
# Send her to the motherfucking curb #

08:48.749 --> 08:49.547
- Yes?

08:49.582 --> 08:51.430
Sarah, your corn is burnt.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.263
- It's fried.

08:53.980 --> 08:55.165
Oh shit.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.672
Kyle, eat.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.420
All right.

09:07.740 --> 09:11.263
Sarah why are you mutilating your corn?

09:12.115 --> 09:14.315
- I don't know, it gets
stuck in your teeth.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.392
You are mutilating your corn.

09:27.427 --> 09:29.065
Dismembering your corn.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.230
Look how much corn it turns into.

09:30.265 --> 09:35.133
I know.

09:36.430 --> 09:38.927
- Let me tell you a secret, I eat corn.

09:40.363 --> 09:43.670
Listen, look at me, don't bite the corn.

09:43.705 --> 09:46.943
You suck that motherfucker and nibble it.

09:46.978 --> 09:49.323
You nibble and suck it
the like this.

09:49.358 --> 09:50.510
Here's the kernel right here.

09:50.545 --> 09:52.753
- See it's all in his
teeth. It's all in his teeth.

09:52.788 --> 09:54.376
Look here, look here.

09:54.411 --> 09:56.347
Damn I gotta get a poker now.

10:01.210 --> 10:02.060
Oh God.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.200
Two hours I'm gonna meet Mr. Shepardson.

10:09.490 --> 10:11.340
His daughter disappeared in May

10:13.300 --> 10:17.443
and both of them, her father
and her saw the shadow people.

10:17.478 --> 10:19.250
- Turn the radio
down do I can get this.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.305
We gotta get this right.

10:20.340 --> 10:23.777
- Okay, we're two hours
out and we are going to-

10:23.812 --> 10:25.212
Hold on, stand by, stand by.

10:25.247 --> 10:27.853
- We're going to Stephen
Shepardson's place.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.775
His daughter disappeared in May

10:32.810 --> 10:36.585
and right before she
disappeared both of them saw

10:36.620 --> 10:40.360
the shadow people, but
warn you, both of you,

10:40.395 --> 10:43.545
he's a little

10:50.700 --> 10:52.150
No, honestly, guys he's like.

10:54.296 --> 10:55.500
Seriously guys, I think he only wants

10:56.957 --> 10:59.630
to talk about like certain things to us.

10:59.665 --> 11:01.325
He seemed off.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.251
I'm not filming you by the way.

11:03.286 --> 11:05.108
You better not be.

11:05.143 --> 11:07.350
She's falling down in the woods

11:07.385 --> 11:08.873
Sarah cannot make it.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.843
She got trapped by a cat.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.500
She's seen him behind

11:19.170 --> 11:21.645
Just get out and piss then dude.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.640
Jesus, might as well, but
do it towards the cameras

11:25.675 --> 11:27.020
so I won't film.

11:29.051 --> 11:33.046
- You won't see
nothing.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.030
Did you see Joe's pecker out?

11:49.065 --> 11:49.863
- No.

11:51.135 --> 11:55.080
- I saw you got strangled
by that vine over there.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.135
You got mad.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.315
- I peed on my sandal.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.945
You peed on your sandal?

11:59.980 --> 12:02.170
What if an animal smells it right now

12:02.205 --> 12:04.090
and tries to attack you.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.084
- Sasquatch?

12:05.119 --> 12:06.008
Yep.

12:06.043 --> 12:08.443
What if a Sasquatch tries to attack you?

12:08.478 --> 12:09.559
I stepped it in your pee.

12:09.594 --> 12:10.605
You stepped it in?

12:10.640 --> 12:12.783
I told to walk around the front.

12:12.818 --> 12:14.927
- And I peed on my foot too.

12:16.010 --> 12:17.945
- I told you to
walk around the front.

12:17.980 --> 12:21.090
- There should be nut
art because every time I do it

12:21.125 --> 12:23.355
I get bad-ass designs and shit.

12:23.390 --> 12:26.290
I'm getting some neat
looking intermittent shit,

12:26.325 --> 12:28.455
so I'm thinking wow that's like art.

12:28.490 --> 12:30.855
If I would have put
that on a fucking canvas

12:30.890 --> 12:34.580
and sell it as nut oil, I
mean I may have a banger.

12:34.615 --> 12:36.798
Somebody may be interested in nut oil.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.610
- Are you going to let them
know that it's actual cum?

12:38.645 --> 12:40.620
- Oh yeah, we're
gonna call it nut art.

12:40.655 --> 12:41.418
Okay?

12:41.453 --> 12:42.535
That's it, it's nut art.

12:42.570 --> 12:45.055
if you were like Sting

12:45.090 --> 12:47.965
you could sell nut art, but you're not.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.805
But wait til you see my designs.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.290
Wait till you fucking see
the designs I make bro.

12:54.249 --> 12:55.872
- Wait, wait, wait
we're not starting yet.

12:55.907 --> 12:56.670
We're not starting yet.

12:56.705 --> 12:58.495
So we're gonna start right now.

12:58.530 --> 13:00.663
- What do you mean
it can't be abbreviated?

13:02.120 --> 13:03.810
- It can't be like R-D, like road.

13:03.845 --> 13:06.385
It has to be fair word.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.005
- I used to play
this game with my step-dad

13:08.040 --> 13:10.450
except we'd have to take
our clothes off every time

13:10.485 --> 13:11.645
we got it right.

13:20.652 --> 13:21.450
- Filming?

13:21.485 --> 13:22.283
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:22.318 --> 13:23.650
I'll do all the talking, remember?

13:23.685 --> 13:24.483
Yep.

13:33.350 --> 13:34.810
Did he know we were coming?

13:34.845 --> 13:35.970
- Yeah, of course.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.083
Well, maybe he fucking forgot.

13:45.224 --> 13:46.456
- No he didn't forget.

13:46.491 --> 13:47.254
Huh?

13:47.289 --> 13:48.260
- There's no way he forgot.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.260
Shall I knock again?

13:51.420 --> 13:53.570
- I don't seen
anybody in there man.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.313
Yeah, fucking knock again.

14:03.150 --> 14:04.050
What the fuck man?

14:05.750 --> 14:07.410
- Look I'm
sorry, I can't do this.

14:07.445 --> 14:09.070
- Mr. Shepardson, it's me, Sarah.

14:09.105 --> 14:10.220
We talked on the phone.

14:11.804 --> 14:13.575
I know who you are.

14:13.610 --> 14:15.775
I just don't feel comfortable doing this.

14:15.810 --> 14:18.260
- Listen, we drove really
far away to get here.

14:18.295 --> 14:19.142
We're not gonna be here long.

14:19.177 --> 14:20.898
I'm just gonna ask you
a couple of questions.

14:20.933 --> 14:22.620
If there's anything you
don't wanna talk about

14:22.655 --> 14:24.103
we won't talk about it.

14:31.770 --> 14:32.855
Hi.

14:32.890 --> 14:34.661
Thank you so much for having us.

14:34.696 --> 14:36.433
I promise we won't stay that long.

14:36.468 --> 14:38.764
This is Kyle, the camera guy.

14:38.799 --> 14:41.025
This is Joe the audio guy.

14:41.060 --> 14:43.455
- Hey, how you do?
- Hi.

14:43.490 --> 14:45.540
You guys can just have a seat over there.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.000
I'm just gonna take a
minute if that's all right.

14:54.035 --> 14:55.500
Yeah, yeah, take it.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.553
- Where do you wanna set up?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.700
- I don't know man,
what the fuck this guy doing?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.598
- I don't know man.

15:04.633 --> 15:07.790
Just let him do it and
let's get this footage.

15:07.825 --> 15:09.390
I guess right here man.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.955
Don't touch anything.

15:19.990 --> 15:22.190
- Yeah, don't
break any Faberge eggs.

15:32.370 --> 15:33.511
Sorry about that.

15:33.546 --> 15:34.653
No problem.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.110
Thank you again for having us.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.263
I really appreciate it.

15:40.780 --> 15:44.605
So where do you want to begin?

15:44.640 --> 15:47.820
- When was the last time
you saw the shadow man?

15:47.855 --> 15:49.663
- There's more than just one of them.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.610
I guess it was after my
daughter Allie was born.

15:55.150 --> 15:56.763
- Can you describe what it looked like?

15:56.798 --> 15:57.833
What they look like?

15:59.970 --> 16:01.683
- Basically just silhouettes.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.800
They'd hide in the shadows,
but they were even darker

16:04.835 --> 16:07.513
than those shadows,
just solid pitch black.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.880
- How many times have you seen them?

16:09.915 --> 16:11.250
- More than I would have liked to.

16:11.285 --> 16:12.655
So often?

16:12.690 --> 16:13.844
- Yeah, it got to a point
where I was seeing them

16:13.879 --> 16:15.203
several times a night.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.573
- Where did you see them?

16:20.360 --> 16:22.160
- They were usually down the hallway

16:23.130 --> 16:24.633
by Allie's bedroom door.

16:25.690 --> 16:28.503
If I got up to turn the light
on, they would disappear.

16:31.020 --> 16:34.465
I know as she got older,
she started seeing them too.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.910
I just never told her that
I was seeing them as well.

16:37.945 --> 16:39.323
I should have, but I didn't.

16:40.270 --> 16:41.120
- Why didn't you?

16:42.970 --> 16:43.803
- I was scared.

16:44.650 --> 16:45.500
- Scared of what?

16:47.880 --> 16:50.425
- I didn't want her to know
I was worried about it.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.970
I mean when you have a kid
you're supposed to be able

16:53.005 --> 16:55.740
to protect them and I
didn't want her to think

16:55.775 --> 16:57.387
that I couldn't protect her.

16:57.422 --> 16:58.811
- All right, I understand.

16:58.846 --> 17:00.200
When did she go missing?

17:03.220 --> 17:06.173
- It was a few days
before her 10th birthday.

17:07.609 --> 17:11.310
She had come in and woke up her mom and I

17:11.345 --> 17:14.435
and told us that the shadow people

17:14.470 --> 17:16.795
had gotten into her bedroom, and they were

17:16.829 --> 17:19.119
pushing her down on her bed, telling her

17:19.155 --> 17:20.032
not to wake up.

17:22.010 --> 17:24.440
We told her it was a dream
and just to go back to sleep,

17:24.474 --> 17:28.369
and she did and that was
the last time we saw her.

17:28.405 --> 17:29.872
She was gone in the morning.

17:29.907 --> 17:31.305
- Did you call the police?

17:31.340 --> 17:35.033
- Absolutely, and do
you know what happened?

17:37.280 --> 17:41.170
Her mom and I were named as prime suspects

17:41.205 --> 17:42.703
in her disappearance case.

17:45.706 --> 17:48.950
Do you have any idea what
it's like to be accused

17:48.985 --> 17:50.993
of your own daughter's disappearance?

17:52.780 --> 17:55.380
Nobody looks at you the
same way, nobody trusts you.

17:57.510 --> 18:01.713
I lost my wife, I lost my job of 15 years,

18:02.930 --> 18:03.963
I lost everything.

18:05.614 --> 18:07.383
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.633
- Yeah.

18:16.850 --> 18:19.283
So what do you want from all this?

18:20.636 --> 18:21.691
- What do you mean?

18:21.726 --> 18:23.883
- What are you hoping to
accomplish with these interviews?

18:25.648 --> 18:29.440
- I think this is, I think
this is a serious matter

18:29.475 --> 18:30.895
that needs more attention.

18:30.930 --> 18:35.930
- Look just, trust me, don't
get involved with this.

18:36.380 --> 18:39.593
Just pack up your equipment and go home.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.473
Seriously.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.135
- Hey, how's it look?

18:45.170 --> 18:47.120
Well, it cuts off kinda weird.

18:48.463 --> 18:49.386
- Are you serious?

18:49.421 --> 18:50.275
What did we get?

18:50.310 --> 18:52.390
- Well, I mean we
pretty much got everything,

18:52.425 --> 18:54.683
but look just check this out.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.030
- What happened,
did the battery die?

19:01.040 --> 19:04.943
- No, battery's fine
and the memory card's fine too.

19:06.330 --> 19:07.180
- That's fucking weird.

19:07.215 --> 19:08.732
Why?

19:08.767 --> 19:10.410
- I'm sure it's nothing.

19:15.740 --> 19:17.260
- Are you sure the battery didn't die?

19:17.295 --> 19:18.058
I'm positive.

19:18.093 --> 19:19.333
I checked all that shit.

19:37.234 --> 19:42.234
# You know I said I'm sorry #

19:42.792 --> 19:47.792
# Show you what I'm all about #

19:50.898 --> 19:55.898
# Oh you know I said I'm sorry #

19:57.128 --> 20:00.961
# Show you what I'm all about #

20:03.274 --> 20:05.515
Hey Kyle, help me get this open.

20:05.550 --> 20:06.485
What's that?

20:06.520 --> 20:09.235
- So we are from here about two hours out.

20:09.270 --> 20:11.950
This is our last interview in Florida.

20:13.550 --> 20:15.155
Who we gonna see?

20:15.190 --> 20:19.940
- Her name is Mae Montgomery
and she's an older lady.

20:19.975 --> 20:20.940
I already talked to her on the phone,

20:20.975 --> 20:22.090
she seems really sweet.

20:23.090 --> 20:25.390
Her husband disappeared
a couple of years ago.

20:29.105 --> 20:29.938
So we're just getting her story.

20:32.730 --> 20:34.980
Yep, two hours, huh?

20:35.870 --> 20:36.703
- Yep.

20:39.690 --> 20:41.567
- Very good with that
take, do you wanna do it again?

20:41.602 --> 20:43.515
That's good.

20:43.550 --> 20:46.233
- Sharpie, put a circle round it.

20:46.268 --> 20:51.268
Chapter eight, verse 21,
section two, circle it.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.725
Put a highlighter on it.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.810
Put a Post-It note next to it.

20:55.845 --> 20:56.835
Circle it.

20:56.870 --> 20:57.835
Hold on, I'm missing this.

20:57.870 --> 21:00.500
So you're saying a woman did do it?

21:00.535 --> 21:01.575
You had a chance.

21:01.610 --> 21:02.425
For a friend?

21:02.460 --> 21:04.410
A friend of yours did it,
- it was a girls night.

21:04.445 --> 21:06.300
but you've never done it back.

21:06.335 --> 21:07.098
Nope.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.453
- What, that's like
the time I let this dude

21:09.488 --> 21:11.774
suck my dick and I didn't
suck his dick back.

21:11.809 --> 21:12.572
- Wait, seriously?

21:12.607 --> 21:15.727
- I've had what do
they call it, like a-

21:18.110 --> 21:19.691
Dick in your mouth before?

21:19.726 --> 21:20.489
- Yeah, but.

21:20.524 --> 21:22.337
One time, listen, I was in a bar.

21:22.372 --> 21:24.115
First time I ever had a squirter.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.040
I was in a bar and this
chick, she was like

21:28.700 --> 21:30.748
kinda gross, whatever.

21:32.162 --> 21:36.240
And all of a sudden she just
squirts all over the place.

21:36.275 --> 21:38.645
The dick was like that
big, it was rock hard.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.878
I had to borrow my brother's underwear

21:40.913 --> 21:43.850
so they were like Jockey
underwear, which I never wear.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.642
I had to get a whole handful of napkins

21:46.677 --> 21:49.365
and literally put napkins in my underwear

21:49.400 --> 21:52.865
and wear like a pad for
the rest of the night.

21:52.900 --> 21:56.330
My underwear was still
wet when I went home.

21:56.365 --> 21:57.795
Jesus Christ.

21:57.830 --> 22:01.850
One time I used to have this
chick worked at the Undertone

22:01.885 --> 22:04.290
and I would have sex with
her and the whole bed

22:04.325 --> 22:07.320
would be wet, but she wasn't a squirter.

22:07.355 --> 22:08.155
She just got wet.

22:08.190 --> 22:09.976
- She just pissed
all over the place.

22:10.011 --> 22:10.774
She probably just peed.

22:10.809 --> 22:11.607
She got nervous and pissed.

22:11.642 --> 22:14.110
No bullshit, this dude
wanted me to piss on him like

22:14.145 --> 22:15.517
- and then she asked me specifically

22:15.552 --> 22:16.855
- And then he wanted to report it.

22:16.890 --> 22:20.300
- Unless she asked me
specifically to piss on her

22:20.335 --> 22:21.098
then I would never piss.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.710
- I think he was
drugging her then taking videos

22:23.745 --> 22:25.600
of people pissing on her and shit.

22:25.635 --> 22:26.398
- For himself?

22:26.433 --> 22:27.725
Yeah, absolutely.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.960
He was a fucking weirdo.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.865
He was my best friend.

22:31.900 --> 22:35.418
His name's Roger, I've been
with his wife all the time.

22:35.453 --> 22:38.700
- We had that dinner
and I was telling him,

22:38.735 --> 22:40.033
this is the last time.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.110
- Do you guys even
believe in this shadow man shit?

22:44.145 --> 22:44.943
- Yes.

22:46.911 --> 22:48.657
- I don't doubt it.

22:48.692 --> 22:53.240
It's not like, I guess it's
like she is with religion.

22:53.275 --> 22:54.290
I guess I'm agnostic.

22:57.373 --> 23:00.237
I don't doubt that it exists, but I also,

23:02.100 --> 23:04.980
unless you see it, unless
I saw it, I wouldn't

23:05.015 --> 23:06.427
believe in it either.

23:08.030 --> 23:08.828
Hi.

23:08.863 --> 23:10.769
- Well hello there. How nice
to meet you, come on in.

23:10.804 --> 23:12.435
- Nice to meet you too.

23:12.470 --> 23:14.808
- Hello gentlemen, come on in, welcome.

23:14.843 --> 23:17.108
- Thank you.
- How you doing?

23:19.559 --> 23:22.622
- Do you mind if I get a few
shots of things around here?

23:22.657 --> 23:24.553
You guys wanna set up on here?

23:24.588 --> 23:26.450
I guess the couch would look good.

23:26.485 --> 23:27.905
- Yeah, that's fine.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.525
- My
husband loved to paint.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.699
He taught me how to do
that nice painting there.

23:32.734 --> 23:33.772
You did this?

23:33.807 --> 23:34.775
- I did, yeah.

23:34.810 --> 23:37.567
He was also a chef and a lot of things.

23:39.260 --> 23:42.340
We had the most beautiful
dinners together all the time.

23:42.375 --> 23:43.665
- That's awesome.

23:43.700 --> 23:47.233
- Well if you kids are hungry,
I've got some leftovers.

23:47.268 --> 23:49.057
- We just ate
on the way over here,

23:49.092 --> 23:51.085
so I'm stuffed.

23:51.120 --> 23:55.420
- Okay, it just seems that ever
since my husband disappeared

23:55.455 --> 23:57.962
everything I make goes to waste.

23:57.997 --> 24:00.470
I can't finish it by myself anymore.

24:00.505 --> 24:02.041
- I see.

24:02.076 --> 24:03.950
I'm probably gonna be
hungry later obviously.

24:03.985 --> 24:06.212
I know they will, it's been a long drive.

24:06.247 --> 24:08.440
- All right, you just let me know, okay,

24:08.475 --> 24:10.043
All right, thank you.

24:10.078 --> 24:10.876
Thank you for offering.

24:10.911 --> 24:11.709
My husband's family

24:11.744 --> 24:12.577
was from Ireland actually.

24:12.612 --> 24:13.476
Was he really?

24:13.511 --> 24:14.640
What part?

24:14.675 --> 24:15.735
- County Cork.

24:15.770 --> 24:17.185
We never did make it over there.

24:17.220 --> 24:18.635
Although we did go to Europe.

24:18.670 --> 24:20.015
We went to France and Italy.

24:20.050 --> 24:22.513
You can see some of the
photographs there on the wall.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.384
- Very neat, that's neat.

24:24.419 --> 24:26.220
How long you been here for?

24:26.255 --> 24:27.765
- 26 years years.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.624
- Oh wow, that's a long time.

24:30.659 --> 24:33.448
All right, so we all set?

24:33.483 --> 24:34.593
- This couch?

24:35.430 --> 24:36.859
- Yeah, that works right?

24:36.894 --> 24:38.254
Is this all right for you?

24:38.289 --> 24:41.181
- Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

24:41.216 --> 24:42.014
- Right.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.683
Can you first start off
by introducing yourself.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.133
- My name is Mrs. Mae Montgomery.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.945
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

24:52.980 --> 24:54.945
- You don't have to be
nervous, don't be nervous.

24:54.980 --> 24:55.925
We're just talking.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.595
We're just gonna be asking you questions.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.490
If there's anything you
feel uncomfortable with

24:59.525 --> 25:02.050
or any questions, just let us know.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.575
We'll talk about something else.

25:04.610 --> 25:05.408
- Okay.

25:07.399 --> 25:09.240
- Do you remember the
first time that you saw

25:09.275 --> 25:10.725
the shadow man?

25:10.760 --> 25:15.760
- Oh yes, I was probably
around 10 years old then.

25:17.990 --> 25:20.483
I've been seeing shadow
men for a long time.

25:22.530 --> 25:25.777
- Can you tell me your
experience when you saw them?

25:26.980 --> 25:31.790
- When I see them, it's
like their using telekinesis

25:31.825 --> 25:33.473
to make me look their way.

25:35.370 --> 25:39.543
They can cause intense fear
until you get used to it.

25:42.440 --> 25:46.755
I think they do that because
you can't take your eyes

25:46.790 --> 25:50.670
off of something your mind
is telling you is there.

25:50.705 --> 25:54.550
Your mind won't let you
take your eyes off something

25:54.585 --> 25:56.183
you fear can harm you.

25:57.980 --> 26:02.980
I think they feel whatever
energy your emitted to.

26:04.560 --> 26:08.983
It's gotten to the point where
I can hear them whispering.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.763
But it's at a very odd frequency.

26:14.530 --> 26:19.263
I think they can see your thoughts.

26:21.168 --> 26:25.195
They know everything you
fear, so the moment you think

26:25.230 --> 26:29.223
of something you fear,
they'll use it against you.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.313
You must learn not to fear them.

26:37.610 --> 26:41.330
I've noticed a decrease
since I've given them

26:41.365 --> 26:42.163
what they want.

26:44.680 --> 26:47.660
Once in a while they still get to me,

26:47.695 --> 26:51.243
but I'm pretty used to them now.

26:53.270 --> 26:56.013
- When was the last time you saw one?

26:57.760 --> 26:59.163
- Just a few days ago.

27:00.200 --> 27:04.130
I noticed it on the wall,
it looked a lot like me

27:04.165 --> 27:08.603
and I swear it was like seeing myself.

27:09.990 --> 27:13.720
After I realized what they
really are I felt sorry

27:13.755 --> 27:15.675
for the shadow people.

27:15.710 --> 27:20.710
The shadow people we see, only we can see,

27:20.740 --> 27:25.673
they're a part of us,
but in a shadow realm.

27:26.980 --> 27:31.783
They envy us our lives, having
what they've always wanted.

27:34.560 --> 27:39.560
It was hard for me to
understand what it really meant.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.933
It can mean many things.

27:43.220 --> 27:47.140
99% of them are evil and
will try to make you weak

27:47.175 --> 27:51.833
and possess you, but mine wasn't evil.

27:53.288 --> 27:58.288
It was good and I would do
almost anything in the world

27:58.450 --> 28:03.450
to help it because I love
myself, even the darkest parts.

28:07.108 --> 28:12.108
Most of the time you see
shadow people, it's because

28:12.540 --> 28:14.423
they want something from you.

28:17.609 --> 28:18.560
The light just flickered.

28:18.595 --> 28:19.719
- You got that?

28:19.754 --> 28:20.844
Yeah.

28:22.395 --> 28:24.134
- Does that happen often?

28:24.169 --> 28:25.873
- Sometimes, it's nothing.

28:33.350 --> 28:36.715
- So you told me on the
phone that you think

28:36.750 --> 28:40.080
your husband was taken
by the shadow people.

28:40.115 --> 28:43.080
- Oh yes, they told me.

28:43.115 --> 28:43.878
- They told you?

28:43.913 --> 28:45.443
- They told me they needed him.

28:45.478 --> 28:46.973
It's doing it again.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.173
Did you hear that?

28:52.790 --> 28:53.588
Yep.

28:53.623 --> 28:54.743
- I didn't hear anything.

28:55.780 --> 28:57.301
- You didn't hear that?

28:57.336 --> 28:58.823
I didn't hear anything.

29:00.020 --> 29:00.970
- Joe you heard it?

29:03.810 --> 29:04.608
Kyle did you hear it?

29:04.643 --> 29:05.623
There it is again.

29:07.150 --> 29:08.561
I hear it.

29:08.596 --> 29:10.153
- You're telling me you don't hear that?

29:11.110 --> 29:12.483
- I don't hear anything.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.403
- Is there somebody
else hear in the house?

29:16.330 --> 29:18.423
- No, I live all alone now.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.053
You've seen them haven't you?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.744
You've seen the shadow people.

29:24.779 --> 29:26.023
- No I have not.

29:27.609 --> 29:29.015
Cut.

29:29.050 --> 29:30.754
We actually have a long drive.

29:30.789 --> 29:32.720
We have to go to Georgia
for our next interview.

29:32.755 --> 29:34.504
Thank you so much for having us.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.253
- Please, stay a bit longer.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.943
I don't get much company out here anymore.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.323
- We have a long drive.

29:44.373 --> 29:45.745
Guys just pack up.

29:45.780 --> 29:46.662
Stop, stop.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.020
- Sarah why the fuck
did you cut the interview

29:55.055 --> 29:56.038
short like that?

29:56.073 --> 29:58.423
- I don't know, I was
just getting freaked out.

29:59.770 --> 30:01.080
- Well that may
have been our only chance

30:01.115 --> 30:02.330
to get some good footage.

30:03.270 --> 30:05.603
- You're right, but when
the light started flicking,

30:07.270 --> 30:09.540
I felt like I got chills in my body.

30:09.575 --> 30:10.712
I felt like someone was there.

30:10.747 --> 30:12.080
But we should have investigated

30:12.115 --> 30:13.085
the noises and shit.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.273
- Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30:16.230 --> 30:18.707
She was really starting
to fucking creep me out.

30:22.910 --> 30:23.708
I'm sorry.

30:23.743 --> 30:24.675
Like what are we doing this for?

30:24.710 --> 30:26.410
What's the point of doing
this if we're not gonna

30:26.445 --> 30:28.065
investigate noises?

30:28.100 --> 30:30.020
That was the perfect
opportunity for us to get

30:30.055 --> 30:31.970
some good footage on this fucking trip.

30:33.616 --> 30:34.866
I don't get it.

30:45.534 --> 30:47.948
# Let me check it out with May #

30:47.983 --> 30:50.363
# I'm just another cheap flight #

30:50.398 --> 30:53.128
# You can fly tonight #

30:53.163 --> 30:56.069
# We'll be whistling Dixie #

30:56.104 --> 31:01.104
# And tomorrow we'll
catch the first ride #

31:01.465 --> 31:05.349
# Out of this town #

31:05.384 --> 31:09.198
# On a Greyhound #

31:09.233 --> 31:12.816
# Out of this town tonight #

31:37.563 --> 31:39.455
Give me a cigarette dude.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.565
But don't tell anybody I smoke.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.605
Look at that bug on me guys.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.896
Oh my God, please somebody get it off.

31:45.931 --> 31:48.230
I didn't bring my light either.

31:48.265 --> 31:49.540
Honest to fucking God.

31:49.575 --> 31:50.373
Oh there we go.

31:51.850 --> 31:52.705
Excuse me, bud.

31:52.740 --> 31:53.560
Thank you my man.

31:54.972 --> 31:55.770
Thank you.

31:55.805 --> 31:56.761
Yeah, no problem.

31:56.796 --> 31:57.683
Welcome to Savannah.

31:57.718 --> 31:59.690
- Thanks a lot man,
appreciate it very much.

31:59.725 --> 32:00.640
What gives it away?

32:01.810 --> 32:03.410
95 out of 100 arch.

32:06.227 --> 32:07.523
And action.

32:08.604 --> 32:11.612
- We are here in beautiful
Savannah, Georgia,

32:11.647 --> 32:14.585
and we are able to meet with Mrs. Philips.

32:14.620 --> 32:18.000
Her daughter recently went
missing and we're going

32:18.035 --> 32:20.235
to have a little talk with her.

32:20.270 --> 32:23.630
She seems like a real nice
lady and I'm interested

32:23.665 --> 32:25.273
to know her story, we are.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.034
Really good.

32:30.069 --> 32:31.837
That was fucking fantastic.

32:31.872 --> 32:32.635
- Really good.

32:32.670 --> 32:34.665
Fantastic.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.194
The bugs don't bother you?

32:49.229 --> 32:50.153
Yeah they do.

32:50.188 --> 32:51.161
They don't get to you?

32:51.196 --> 32:52.099
Okay, it's you too.

32:52.134 --> 32:54.263
I was like it must be me, I'm stinky.

33:02.078 --> 33:02.911
- So bad.

33:07.910 --> 33:09.577
- Another cute face.

33:11.219 --> 33:14.377
That's funny, that's so funny.

33:14.412 --> 33:15.195
- They're everywhere.

33:15.230 --> 33:16.900
I know it's crazy.

33:16.935 --> 33:18.091
It's stupid.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.284
- I need a shower.

33:20.319 --> 33:25.319
# The world has lost worst thing #

33:26.010 --> 33:30.177
# I cling to the old rocket cross #

33:33.854 --> 33:35.375
Whoa, stones.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.160
I know, it's like rock climbing,

33:37.195 --> 33:39.043
seriously, seriously.

33:45.306 --> 33:50.306
Oh shit, okay people we've got
Sasquatch finding right here.

33:51.270 --> 33:53.600
I'd like to go ahead
and document this one.

33:53.635 --> 33:55.944
This is document finding two 14

33:55.979 --> 33:58.253
on the Sasquatch findings catalog.

34:01.180 --> 34:02.295
Oh God-damn it.

34:02.330 --> 34:06.331
Sarah I'm trying to get
the fucking focus man.

34:06.366 --> 34:10.333
Two 14, got it, cataloged
it, got it, thank you.

34:15.090 --> 34:17.260
We're way on down there.

34:17.295 --> 34:18.092
Flocko.

34:22.139 --> 34:23.590
Who are you talking to Sarah?

34:27.007 --> 34:28.344
- My mom.

34:28.380 --> 34:29.628
- Oh, tell her I said hi.

34:30.460 --> 34:32.409
You don't ever wanna
ride one of those things.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.534
Always smell of shit.

34:33.570 --> 34:35.199
- Somebody else has got to hold this dude.

34:35.235 --> 34:36.853
I can't look at it, I'm driving.

34:37.704 --> 34:42.110
- 200 feet, or
no 100 feet now, 50 feet.

34:42.145 --> 34:43.060
Turn right?

34:44.018 --> 34:46.040
- In 800 feet turn
left on Turner Boulevard.

34:46.074 --> 34:46.838
There we go.

34:46.873 --> 34:49.253
- So hold on a second.
Somebody made a Cheetos.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.634
- No there's a Cheetos
they found that like.

34:51.668 --> 34:54.135
- No, someone fucking found a Cheetos

34:54.170 --> 34:56.862
that looked like the
God-damn gorilla, Harumbe?

34:58.738 --> 35:01.534
- And they sold it for 100,000.

35:01.569 --> 35:03.958
- Stop.
- Let's buy a ton of Cheetos.

35:03.993 --> 35:06.825
- It's fucking 100
degrees in this piece of shit.

35:06.860 --> 35:10.300
The seats are uncomfortable
and I got boogers in my nose.

35:10.335 --> 35:12.495
- Hey you're human, it's okay.

35:12.530 --> 35:14.896
- Well at least you
don't bitch about stuff, Joe.

35:14.931 --> 35:18.280
- That's the thing, I don't ever bitch.

35:18.315 --> 35:19.363
Good thing about me.

35:21.030 --> 35:24.170
I don't ever complain,
I'm not a complainer.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.567
Jesus Christ.

35:25.602 --> 35:27.421
It's a green light, keep going.

35:27.456 --> 35:29.629
- Oh God, oh Jesus.
- Jesus.

35:29.664 --> 35:31.803
Point four miles, take a left.

35:33.510 --> 35:35.242
I could do Siri's voice.

35:35.277 --> 35:36.843
I'm tired too.

35:36.878 --> 35:38.410
Let's all nap.

35:39.744 --> 35:41.996
- No, pussies.
- That makes it hot?

35:42.031 --> 35:43.900
- Yeah, 'cause
it's like fucking running.

35:43.935 --> 35:46.493
You can shut it off for a while.

35:47.940 --> 35:49.523
I think we're good.

36:00.852 --> 36:03.646
- I definitely had
a paranormal experience.

36:03.681 --> 36:06.440
That's one of the reasons
I've been so obsessed

36:06.475 --> 36:09.173
with this film, this documentary.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.215
If I never went through what I did,

36:13.250 --> 36:14.830
I wouldn't be interested in it.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.050
Where do I start?

36:21.330 --> 36:24.545
Besides personal experiences,
it's one of those things.

36:24.580 --> 36:27.760
I know everyone, there's always
things, paranormal things.

36:27.795 --> 36:30.665
There's superstitions,

36:30.700 --> 36:32.883
there's things that you wanna believe,

36:33.834 --> 36:35.553
but you're not sure if
they're actually real.

36:36.890 --> 36:39.644
I really just wanted to interview people

36:39.679 --> 36:42.363
that have experienced the shadow people

36:42.398 --> 36:45.080
and the fact I'm actually
doing a documentary on it

36:45.115 --> 36:49.203
with my good buddies I'm just so thankful.

36:52.422 --> 36:57.172
# All the things that light has deprived #

37:00.770 --> 37:02.953
Well there it is, the sun's down.

37:05.168 --> 37:07.847
- Here you go, keep it
right here in the fire.

37:07.882 --> 37:10.527
Pick it up a little it,
keep the fire burning.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.635
I can use this right here and flip it.

37:11.670 --> 37:14.410
Sometimes I get a big log
like that and just flip it.

37:14.445 --> 37:17.150
I just get a big old log
like that, see that big one?

37:17.185 --> 37:20.073
I just flip it around,
keep it from burning.

37:22.549 --> 37:25.117
Get a big old piece of
driftwood like this,

37:25.152 --> 37:27.611
it better be on.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.234
- Do we have enough wood?

37:29.269 --> 37:31.087
- We got enough
wood for a couple of days.

37:31.122 --> 37:32.093
Yeah.

37:32.128 --> 37:36.211
- In fact we can live a
couple days on this wood.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.480
- Hello, my name is Kyle Miller.

37:49.515 --> 37:50.842
Tell me about yourself Kyle.

37:50.877 --> 37:52.170
- My name is Kyle Miller.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.198
You're too close.

37:54.233 --> 37:55.804
My name's Kyle, I'm out of focus.

37:55.839 --> 37:57.437
No you're not.

37:57.472 --> 37:59.036
- Today, I'm here.

38:03.024 --> 38:03.897
Together.

38:03.932 --> 38:05.830
Do you wanna fight karate, karate?

38:05.865 --> 38:07.551
- I want you to listen to me.

38:09.970 --> 38:13.330
As I sit on the plains of the Earth,

38:13.365 --> 38:15.895
the atmosphere is one with me.

38:15.930 --> 38:18.133
- Hi, do you wanna be taken serious?

38:20.210 --> 38:21.370
Do you wanna live the life you love

38:21.405 --> 38:22.720
and love the life you live?

38:24.310 --> 38:25.833
Teach a man how to eat fish.

38:28.950 --> 38:32.373
I want you to know that two
weeks ago I weighed 325 pounds,

38:33.340 --> 38:35.033
just three short weeks ago.

38:36.060 --> 38:38.265
- This is fucking
absolutely incredible Joe.

38:38.300 --> 38:43.300
This fucking sky right now
looks like a million bucks dude.

38:52.170 --> 38:54.599
Here he comes, your cookie's
right over here mate.

38:54.634 --> 38:56.334
It's right over here,
it's right over here.

38:56.369 --> 38:59.094
He's got the cookie mate.

38:59.129 --> 39:01.819
He strikes a bit.

39:03.250 --> 39:05.945
There you go.

39:05.980 --> 39:07.274
You took the cookie, mate.

39:07.309 --> 39:08.933
- It took the cookie.

39:08.968 --> 39:11.249
- Look here he comes again.
- Go.

39:11.284 --> 39:13.028
Look, there he is mate.

39:13.063 --> 39:14.773
Looking for more cookie.

39:16.590 --> 39:18.660
He's got a lot of balls on him.

39:18.695 --> 39:19.660
Go lay down.

39:32.530 --> 39:35.363
- I think we got a lot of footage today.

39:35.398 --> 39:36.823
We did good.

39:36.858 --> 39:38.249
Do you think so?

39:40.052 --> 39:42.719
- Yeah.
- We got some good stuff.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.620
Yeah I mean it was pretty good.

39:49.383 --> 39:52.550
There's a couple things I wish
we'd have done differently.

39:52.585 --> 39:53.383
But.
- What?

39:54.680 --> 39:59.632
- Well, I don't
know, in hindsight 20/20,

39:59.667 --> 40:01.963
you always wanna do shit
different after you're done.

40:04.710 --> 40:05.508
Where they going?

40:05.543 --> 40:06.770
Where they need to be?

40:11.323 --> 40:14.156
- Albuquerque.
- Albuquerque, mate.

40:15.454 --> 40:19.372
- I'm glad you asked that
question, Albuquerque.

40:19.407 --> 40:22.012
Albuquerque, mate.

40:22.047 --> 40:25.423
I need to forewarn you
guys, I sleep in the nude.

40:28.080 --> 40:31.715
Every night at 11 o'clock I take a poop.

40:31.750 --> 40:35.200
- Is it actually like,
do you have a specific time.

40:35.235 --> 40:37.727
- 11 o'clock
daily, so what time is it?

40:37.762 --> 40:40.220
It's like 10:58, 'cause it's urging.

40:40.255 --> 40:41.115
I know when it's time.

40:41.150 --> 40:43.690
Look I know the time by poop feel.

40:43.725 --> 40:44.965
It's not funny.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.120
It's not fucking funny.

40:46.155 --> 40:46.918
What time is it?

40:46.953 --> 40:48.073
- You guys better
not fart in the tent,

40:48.108 --> 40:48.955
I swear to God.

40:48.990 --> 40:51.118
Oh well, I'm a farter.

40:51.153 --> 40:52.570
You know how people are huggers?

40:52.605 --> 40:53.465
I'm a farter.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.885
When I meet people I'm like
hi.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.362
Oh, sorry.

40:57.397 --> 41:00.842
- Honestly guys, if you're
honest, how do you feel

41:00.877 --> 41:03.133
about the interviews so far?

41:03.168 --> 41:05.390
Do you think they're solid?

41:05.425 --> 41:06.435
Do you think that?

41:06.470 --> 41:09.070
- Well, do you want me
to be honest or do you want us

41:09.105 --> 41:11.670
to make it through another
couple days of shooting?

41:14.400 --> 41:15.413
I think it went well.

41:17.916 --> 41:18.816
I do too.

41:19.850 --> 41:21.293
I think it's going real well.

41:22.393 --> 41:23.525
- I just wish I did.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.555
- We should have
investigate those noises

41:25.590 --> 41:29.713
a little more, that fucking
lady's house, but whatever.

41:30.610 --> 41:31.565
It was still good.

41:31.600 --> 41:34.242
- Kyle, who taught
you how to make a fire?

41:34.277 --> 41:35.359
Yeah 'cause it sucks.

41:35.394 --> 41:36.407
It does.

41:36.442 --> 41:37.981
- You make the
worst fire I've ever seen.

41:38.016 --> 41:40.643
So what do we do with it now?

41:40.678 --> 41:43.235
Jesus Kyle, oh my God.

41:43.270 --> 41:46.130
- Have you ever
farted and shit a little?

41:46.165 --> 41:47.810
I think that's what just happened.

41:47.845 --> 41:49.665
Fuck it stinks.

41:49.700 --> 41:50.963
Oh my God.

41:50.998 --> 41:52.185
I'm gonna change it tomorrow.

41:52.220 --> 41:53.458
- That was the fucking
baked beans you ate earlier.

41:53.493 --> 41:54.913
Joe, that's disgusting.

41:54.948 --> 41:55.802
I'll be changing them tomorrow.

41:55.837 --> 41:58.853
- Check your
pants, that's horrible.

41:58.888 --> 42:02.010
You pooped, you pooped.

42:02.045 --> 42:03.652
Did you really poop dude or what?

42:03.687 --> 42:05.485
Just a little, just enough

42:05.520 --> 42:07.283
to make it last all night.

42:08.849 --> 42:11.490
I've got a little pouch,
can you get a camera shot?

42:11.525 --> 42:13.266
I sure can.

42:13.301 --> 42:14.099
Of my pouch.

42:14.134 --> 42:16.003
- Yeah, yeah, you
got a little poop pouch.

42:16.038 --> 42:18.325
I'm just holding it.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.273
- I'm not sleeping
in the fucking tent

42:19.308 --> 42:21.190
with you guys tomorrow.

42:21.225 --> 42:22.612
This is bullshit.

42:22.647 --> 42:23.532
- Why?

42:23.567 --> 42:25.590
'Cause you fuckers fart.

42:25.625 --> 42:26.388
- I don't fart.

42:26.423 --> 42:27.221
You're stinky.

42:27.256 --> 42:29.083
- I have unicorn dust, I don't fart.

42:30.424 --> 42:32.454
- His fucking feet
are right in my face.

42:32.489 --> 42:33.787
Your feet stink.

42:34.834 --> 42:36.724
- I'm just gonna pre-warn
you, I'm a farter

42:36.759 --> 42:38.653
and I have bad foot fungus.

42:40.054 --> 42:43.374
- You're gonna have
to turn the other way dude.

42:43.409 --> 42:45.683
Hey wait, listen, listen, listen.

42:48.427 --> 42:50.094
- Oh my fucking God.

42:54.727 --> 42:56.863
I can't do this, I can't do this.

42:56.898 --> 42:59.376
I'm sleeping outside with the raccoons.

42:59.411 --> 43:00.237
I swear to God.

43:00.272 --> 43:01.366
It tastes like cinnamon.

43:01.401 --> 43:02.996
- If I fucking smell that, I swear to God.

43:03.031 --> 43:05.985
If that's I swear to God.

43:06.020 --> 43:09.554
- Hey, y'all wanted to
do the barbecue spot earlier.

43:09.589 --> 43:12.545
You gave my body them beans.

43:12.580 --> 43:14.200
- If I farted guys,
what would you guys do?

43:14.235 --> 43:15.765
Would you accept it?

43:15.800 --> 43:17.470
I don't know, fart and let's see

43:17.505 --> 43:18.268
what it's looking like.

43:18.303 --> 43:20.120
- It depends on
which one it came out of.

43:20.155 --> 43:21.542
- Not forcefully fart.

43:21.577 --> 43:22.895
I just did.

43:22.930 --> 43:24.615
- That was a forced one?

43:24.650 --> 43:25.805
I forced the hell out of it.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.335
Well, he did, so I fucking had to do it.

43:29.370 --> 43:30.688
He's not gonna be the only
one to fart in this tent.

43:30.723 --> 43:32.652
How can you force a fart?

43:32.687 --> 43:33.587
It's like a mental thing.

43:33.622 --> 43:35.425
- Look I want you
to know that I only fart

43:35.460 --> 43:38.403
when I'm really, really
comfortable around people.

43:39.790 --> 43:41.483
So you should take that as a-

43:43.580 --> 43:44.745
I'm uncomfortable.

43:44.780 --> 43:47.201
I fart when I'm
uncomfortable around people.

43:49.970 --> 43:50.983
So exact opposite.

43:52.060 --> 43:53.335
I still would really appreciate you-

43:53.370 --> 43:55.810
- I don't fart, I've never
farted before in my life.

43:55.845 --> 43:56.643
Girls don't fart.

43:56.678 --> 43:57.476
- No.

43:58.510 --> 43:59.985
I told you, it's unicorn dust.

44:00.020 --> 44:02.275
Yeah right, it's just pixie dust.

44:02.310 --> 44:03.305
- Pixie dust.

44:03.340 --> 44:04.673
It's all glitter and shit.

44:05.682 --> 44:08.228
And it makes a sound like ring.

44:08.263 --> 44:10.045
Rainbows.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.233
What's the magic sound?

44:11.268 --> 44:13.768
How do you do the magic sound?

44:14.860 --> 44:15.875
Ring.

44:15.910 --> 44:17.986
No, that's a God-damn old phone.

44:18.021 --> 44:20.063
Like magic, magic like shing.

44:22.142 --> 44:23.575
Joe you just did a phone too.

44:23.610 --> 44:26.035
- I know, but mine
was just a smaller-

44:26.070 --> 44:28.564
- You have like
a rotary dial phone.

44:28.599 --> 44:31.078
Can we just go to bed please?

44:31.113 --> 44:33.558
All right, all right,

44:35.394 --> 44:37.317
I'm turning the motherfucking thing off.

44:55.000 --> 44:55.833
Sarah.

44:56.961 --> 44:57.794
Sarah.

44:59.490 --> 45:00.410
Get up Sarah.

45:00.445 --> 45:01.978
- Kyle, turn it off.

45:02.013 --> 45:03.228
Sarah.

45:04.678 --> 45:05.511
Sarah.

45:06.711 --> 45:07.600
Wake up.

45:07.635 --> 45:08.454
- Stop.

45:08.489 --> 45:09.572
Wake up.

45:09.607 --> 45:10.463
Joe, wake up.

45:10.498 --> 45:12.123
Get that thing out of my face.

45:12.158 --> 45:14.084
- Wake up.
- What time is it?

45:14.119 --> 45:15.167
It's like seven.

45:15.202 --> 45:16.858
- Okay, Kyle, turn it off.

45:16.893 --> 45:18.723
Wake up, Joe wake up.

45:18.758 --> 45:20.553
Get up, let's go.

45:22.580 --> 45:23.763
- Five more minutes.

45:25.224 --> 45:27.428
Five more minutes, just five, please

45:27.463 --> 45:28.633
Nope, let's go.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.500
You guys look sexy in the morning.

45:36.690 --> 45:37.573
Thank you.

45:39.433 --> 45:41.170
- Did any of you
guys get lucky last night?

45:41.205 --> 45:42.395
Nope.

45:42.430 --> 45:44.180
Somebody put it in my ass.

45:45.827 --> 45:47.152
You guys getting bit?

45:47.187 --> 45:48.478
'Cause I'm getting bit.

45:48.513 --> 45:49.811
Uh-huh.

45:52.831 --> 45:55.348
I forgot the spray.

45:55.383 --> 45:56.923
- Yeah, there
should be some in the car.

46:08.610 --> 46:09.646
- Kyle.

46:11.430 --> 46:12.930
Turn up my jams dude.

46:15.430 --> 46:16.903
Turn up my jams bro.

46:32.490 --> 46:36.640
- All right guys, we are
going to see Mrs. Philips.

46:36.675 --> 46:38.225
This is actually a recent case.

46:38.260 --> 46:43.083
She seems, she still seems
really shook up about it,

46:43.118 --> 46:44.183
which I can imagine.

46:44.218 --> 46:45.249
Turn right here.

46:59.440 --> 47:01.569
- Well, hello there, you must be Sarah.

47:01.604 --> 47:02.367
Mrs. Philips.

47:02.402 --> 47:04.910
- This is my dog Beau, he's
friendly, he won't bite.

47:06.210 --> 47:08.235
- This is my
AV crew, Kyle and Joe.

47:08.270 --> 47:10.620
- It's a pleasure to meet
you both, come on in.

47:11.700 --> 47:12.860
Beautiful place.

47:12.895 --> 47:13.985
- Thank you so much.

47:14.020 --> 47:15.244
Can I offer you something to drink?

47:16.810 --> 47:18.165
it's okay.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.093
It's okay, little Beau.

47:20.998 --> 47:23.702
Beau Beau, you're fine.

47:23.737 --> 47:25.220
Can I offer you guys something to drink?

47:25.255 --> 47:26.018
Water.

47:26.053 --> 47:27.440
- Okay, do you boys
want something to drink?

47:27.475 --> 47:28.803
A water too?

47:28.838 --> 47:29.908
- Sure, thanks.
- Yeah sure, thanks.

47:29.943 --> 47:31.146
- All right, thank you.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.314
I'll be right back.

47:32.349 --> 47:33.147
What type's the doggie?

47:33.182 --> 47:35.310
- He is
part chihuahua part pug.

47:36.730 --> 47:38.185
You guys made it all right?

47:38.220 --> 47:39.680
The drive, you're comfortable?

47:39.715 --> 47:41.105
You can stretch your legs.

47:41.140 --> 47:44.105
- It's very long,
especially with these two.

47:44.140 --> 47:46.186
The feeling's mutual.

47:46.221 --> 47:47.353
Oh is that how it is?

47:48.270 --> 47:50.940
- Are they
getting on your nerves are they?

47:50.975 --> 47:52.405
Just a little bit.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.238
You wanna?

47:53.273 --> 47:54.555
Here, I'll take that.

47:54.590 --> 47:55.425
Okay, great, thank you.

47:55.460 --> 47:57.100
So you guys drove all
the way from Florida.

47:57.135 --> 47:57.898
Is that right?

47:57.933 --> 47:59.805
Yep, Tampa area.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.240
- That sure is a long drive.

48:02.235 --> 48:04.910
That's a long drive, but I'm
so glad that you're here.

48:04.945 --> 48:05.855
Thanks for coming.

48:05.890 --> 48:07.536
Thank you for having us.

48:07.571 --> 48:09.048
You're welcome.

48:09.083 --> 48:10.898
- If you're ready, we
can get started if you want.

48:10.933 --> 48:13.815
- Yeah, certainly, that'll be fine.

48:15.047 --> 48:18.600
- We just need
to bring in some stuff.

48:18.635 --> 48:19.695
Won't take us long.

48:19.730 --> 48:21.146
- All
right, that's no problem.

48:21.181 --> 48:22.563
All this cool air.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.760
- Yeah,
Florida is not normally known

48:25.795 --> 48:27.775
for its cool temperatures.

48:27.810 --> 48:29.720
It's so humid.

48:29.755 --> 48:32.240
- It is, it is,
especially this time of year.

48:34.025 --> 48:36.440
- It's not the
heat, it's the humidity.

48:36.475 --> 48:37.238
That's right,

48:37.273 --> 48:38.825
and you can never keep your hair.

48:38.860 --> 48:40.916
- Oh I don't even
bother straightening it.

48:40.951 --> 48:42.055
Just let it go frizz.

48:42.090 --> 48:43.485
That's right.

48:43.520 --> 48:44.318
Thank you again for having us.

48:44.353 --> 48:45.495
Oh you're so welcome.

48:45.530 --> 48:47.655
I'm so grateful that you can come.

48:47.690 --> 48:51.023
I really wanna explore
this when I tell the story.

48:54.030 --> 48:56.940
Pardon my dog, his clickety-clacking

48:56.975 --> 48:59.295
will calm down I'm sure.

48:59.330 --> 49:00.449
You said his name's Beau.

49:00.484 --> 49:01.534
Yes, Beau.

49:01.569 --> 49:03.652
Beau, hey Beau.

49:05.290 --> 49:08.910
- He likes new people, once
he gets a little comfortable.

49:08.945 --> 49:12.530
It's just the hardest thing
that I've ever dealt with.

49:12.860 --> 49:14.313
I miss her so much.

49:17.207 --> 49:18.180
It must be so difficult.

49:18.215 --> 49:19.013
- It is.

49:20.350 --> 49:21.965
How old is Katie?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.020
- She was eight going on 18.

49:24.055 --> 49:26.400
So full of personality.

49:26.435 --> 49:28.715
- Is that her?

49:28.750 --> 49:30.213
- That is, that's my baby.

49:34.273 --> 49:36.580
- Oh my gosh, she's so beautiful.

49:36.615 --> 49:39.135
- Thank you, she was my joy.

49:39.170 --> 49:40.220
- Do you mind if the camera sees it.

49:40.255 --> 49:41.053
- Sure.

49:43.830 --> 49:44.628
Cutie.

49:44.663 --> 49:46.553
- I have some more pictures over here.

49:55.030 --> 49:57.410
Henry, you're home early.

49:57.445 --> 49:58.675
- What's going on?

49:58.710 --> 50:00.210
- Nothing, there's just some students here

50:00.245 --> 50:02.235
making a school film.

50:02.270 --> 50:03.620
- A school film about what?

50:10.844 --> 50:13.535
You're doing what I think you're doing.

50:13.570 --> 50:17.090
- Honey listen, I wasn't
going to say anything.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.113
- You all need to leave.

50:22.090 --> 50:24.480
- Henry, these kids drove
all the way from Florida

50:24.515 --> 50:25.785
to do this interview.

50:25.820 --> 50:28.778
- I don't care where they came from, go.

50:28.813 --> 50:30.056
- I'm sorry,
I really didn't think

50:30.091 --> 50:31.265
this was going to be a problem.

50:31.300 --> 50:32.645
Honestly can we please go back,

50:32.680 --> 50:35.641
'cause I wanna freaking get some answers.

50:35.676 --> 50:38.603
I'm so fucking mad, we
didn't say anything.

50:45.220 --> 50:46.170
Hey Sarah.

50:47.367 --> 50:48.165
Yeah?

50:48.200 --> 50:50.125
Do you have any more cigarettes?

50:50.160 --> 50:50.923
Do I what?

50:50.958 --> 50:51.791
Do you have any more cigarettes?

50:51.826 --> 50:52.589
No.

50:52.624 --> 50:55.140
- I'm pretty sure
that's somebody's home

50:55.175 --> 50:55.938
and trash can.

50:55.973 --> 50:57.035
Oh my God.

50:57.070 --> 50:58.535
God-damn do these bugs are crazy.

50:58.570 --> 51:02.380
Is there like a dead body around
this motherfucker or what?

51:02.415 --> 51:04.093
Holy shit.

51:05.080 --> 51:05.913
- Those people.

51:11.370 --> 51:12.950
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

51:12.985 --> 51:13.783
Totally

51:15.320 --> 51:17.892
- I'm telling you, he
could be going there.

51:17.927 --> 51:19.392
Making human soup.

51:21.549 --> 51:22.398
Human soup?

51:22.433 --> 51:23.212
- Human soup.

51:23.247 --> 51:26.653
- I love human
soup, it's my favorite.

51:26.688 --> 51:29.449
Holy Christ of God himself, I've gotta go.

51:29.484 --> 51:32.210
You wanna head on over
to Memaw Restaurant?

51:34.690 --> 51:36.345
Get on over there to Memaw's,

51:36.380 --> 51:41.380
get me some country fried
steak and some grits

51:42.350 --> 51:44.125
and some corned beef hash.

51:44.160 --> 51:47.160
We'll call it a day with
a thing of orange juice.

51:47.195 --> 51:48.215
It'll be a good day.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.370
These bugs are out of fucking
control out here dude.

51:50.405 --> 51:52.895
Stop get his iPhone charger and shit.

51:52.930 --> 51:56.984
God-damn it man, I told you
stop and fuck in Dublin.

51:57.019 --> 51:57.853
I told you three times.

51:57.888 --> 51:59.757
You should have told me earlier.

51:59.792 --> 52:01.626
- All I do is the fucking Indian.

52:01.661 --> 52:02.424
That's Jamaican.

52:02.459 --> 52:03.781
No that's Indian.

52:06.180 --> 52:07.358
Let me tell you.

52:07.393 --> 52:09.480
Let me right now tell
you what's good for you.

52:09.515 --> 52:11.075
Me know Jamaica boy.

52:11.110 --> 52:14.105
You don't know Kingston
like me know Kingston boy.

52:14.140 --> 52:17.065
Let me tell you now

52:17.100 --> 52:19.110
shit right not on your face boy.

52:19.145 --> 52:22.606
I'm gonna tell you, me know
what me doing right now.

52:22.641 --> 52:23.404
Okay?

52:23.439 --> 52:25.370
Me rocking down to the bottom.

52:26.933 --> 52:30.130
Me not fuck, none of that, okay.

52:30.165 --> 52:31.205
Then come the Indian.

52:31.240 --> 52:34.685
Right after the Indian say
okay, when you're done.

52:34.720 --> 52:38.130
When the Jamaican finished
the Indian say okay,

52:38.165 --> 52:40.560
that's how that fucking accent works.

52:40.595 --> 52:41.860
These are my fucking eyes.

52:46.479 --> 52:49.553
Oh no, he's gonna die.

52:54.847 --> 52:57.211
Look at how he's suffering.

53:00.474 --> 53:03.625
It's coming out of my nose.

53:03.660 --> 53:06.479
- I can't watch
him suffer like this.

53:08.117 --> 53:11.140
- Are you seriously
using a paper map right now?

53:11.175 --> 53:12.240
Chattanooga?

53:13.774 --> 53:14.817
Chattahoochee.

53:14.852 --> 53:15.650
Chattahoochee.

53:15.685 --> 53:18.230
- I haven't seen one
of these in 20 fucking years.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.325
Oh that looked creepy.

53:20.360 --> 53:22.360
Put your hand behind it,
it looked like a monster

53:22.395 --> 53:24.726
or spider or something.

53:24.761 --> 53:26.052
Oh my God.

53:26.087 --> 53:28.220
Look at this the dragon.

53:28.255 --> 53:29.233
Oh shit.

53:31.340 --> 53:32.925
Jesus.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.350
Oh my God we almost died,
seriously we almost fucking died.

53:35.385 --> 53:37.740
- How did we almost die?
- I fucking got it.

53:37.775 --> 53:39.412
I fucking got that man.

53:39.447 --> 53:42.393
We almost fucking died.

53:43.230 --> 53:45.108
That was a ghost.

53:45.143 --> 53:47.200
That was a fucking ghost.

53:47.235 --> 53:48.305
We've now proven it.

53:48.340 --> 53:50.500
Sarah McCormick has proven the validity

53:50.535 --> 53:51.875
of the shadow man.

53:51.910 --> 53:56.203
We have seen him on
route into Chattahoochee.

53:57.080 --> 53:59.350
That's all I use, I used to do-

53:59.385 --> 54:00.776
- National Four S.

54:00.811 --> 54:02.167
No problem.

54:03.245 --> 54:04.735
My data is excessive.

54:04.770 --> 54:09.680
- Well there goes into Macon
area, Atlanta, Georgia, now.

54:09.715 --> 54:10.478
We're heading on up.

54:10.513 --> 54:15.235
We are en route to find the shadow man,

54:15.270 --> 54:20.270
which we have just proven
in front of us here today

54:20.580 --> 54:23.933
on this very route, we
have seen the shadow man.

54:25.874 --> 54:28.910
- You know the game
called Legend of Zelda?

54:28.945 --> 54:29.708
- Yes.

54:29.743 --> 54:31.115
That's why it's about a map.

54:31.150 --> 54:33.107
- I'm glad I can be a part of it.

54:34.535 --> 54:38.262
# I can't see a thousand miles from here #

54:38.297 --> 54:42.944
# But I can feel #

54:42.979 --> 54:44.984
# Slim up all falling down #

54:45.019 --> 54:46.034
# It's so good #

54:46.069 --> 54:46.975
# Black ten #

54:47.010 --> 54:48.139
# Scratch ten #

54:48.174 --> 54:49.233
# Treat all wood #

54:49.268 --> 54:52.726
# I got love for the only
people that I should #

54:52.761 --> 54:53.524
# Dip down #

54:53.559 --> 54:55.956
# Here we got that
people about to change #

54:55.991 --> 54:58.775
# And I ain't got that #

54:58.810 --> 55:03.775
# Congratulations #

55:05.255 --> 55:10.255
# Father strangulation #

55:10.352 --> 55:12.607
# Row row row your boat #

55:12.642 --> 55:14.827
# Up and down the stream #

55:14.862 --> 55:19.862
# Merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream #

55:20.231 --> 55:21.135
I feel like we're all losing.

55:21.170 --> 55:23.600
- We're all in our own
world right now I believe.

55:23.635 --> 55:25.728
I'm the only sane one.

55:25.763 --> 55:27.213
I highly doubt that.

55:29.830 --> 55:31.343
- I remember just like that.

55:33.440 --> 55:37.435
I was on the same road,
1967 I just got out

55:37.470 --> 55:42.470
of the psychiatric
institution for a long string

55:42.820 --> 55:46.210
of addiction to heavy
narcotics after fighting

55:46.245 --> 55:48.583
in the Korean War and losing my pinky toe.

55:49.995 --> 55:51.745
Some people talk about losing their arm,

55:51.780 --> 55:56.330
losing their leg, I lost
my motherfucking pinky toe.

55:58.730 --> 56:00.745
You don't ever get your pinky toe back.

56:00.780 --> 56:04.710
How many motherfuckers you seen
down at the prostetic clinic

56:04.745 --> 56:07.313
getting fitted for a pinky toe.

56:08.800 --> 56:09.633
Not one.

56:11.515 --> 56:16.463
I still walk with a limp, can't
find socks that fit right,

56:17.550 --> 56:19.863
they always too loose or too tight.

56:26.730 --> 56:30.503
Heaven forbid I ever find me
a woman missing a pinky toe.

56:31.410 --> 56:34.793
Heaven forbid 'cause I
will marry that woman.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.173
Put babies up inside her.

56:43.663 --> 56:45.590
- If she has a pinky toe or
if she's missing a pinky toe?

56:45.625 --> 56:47.295
If she got a butt hole,

56:47.330 --> 56:50.123
she gonna be missing a
butt hole, 'cause I'm gonna

56:50.158 --> 56:52.087
fuck it right out of her.

56:53.550 --> 56:55.580
And I'm gonna cut her
fucking pinky toe off

56:55.615 --> 56:56.820
when I'm leaving the house.

56:56.855 --> 56:57.875
- I'm eating tuna.

56:57.910 --> 57:00.400
- So how are we
suppose to find this dude?

57:00.435 --> 57:02.890
- He told me he'd be
the only car out there.

57:02.925 --> 57:03.973
We won't miss him,

57:06.756 --> 57:07.963
so he says.

57:07.998 --> 57:09.985
- I mean this sounds
like a mob hit or some shit.

57:10.020 --> 57:12.468
- I know it really does. It
should be very interesting.

57:12.503 --> 57:15.673
This guy is very to himself.

57:17.099 --> 57:22.099
He hasn't really, he doesn't
give me his name or anything

57:22.198 --> 57:25.023
or any information, but he
does want to show us a video.

57:26.043 --> 57:27.995
So it should be interesting.

57:28.030 --> 57:29.657
- He doesn't
wanna give you his name?

57:29.692 --> 57:31.990
- No, no information at all.

57:33.921 --> 57:36.029
- Well, what the
fuck is that all about?

57:36.064 --> 57:37.193
I don't know.

57:37.228 --> 57:39.293
- And we're going the
right way to find this guy?

57:40.419 --> 57:42.049
Where the fuck are we?

57:42.084 --> 57:43.645
I guess this is it.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.200
I'm sure that's his car.

57:45.235 --> 57:46.685
It's gotta be.

57:46.720 --> 57:47.970
It's the only car around.

57:49.070 --> 57:50.753
I don't see any other cars.

57:51.780 --> 57:53.223
I don't trust sitting in it.

58:01.312 --> 58:02.789
There's no man in it.

58:02.824 --> 58:04.231
Are you sure?

58:04.266 --> 58:06.133
Yes, do you see?

58:06.168 --> 58:07.265
No, you're right.

58:07.300 --> 58:08.870
Where the fuck this guy is.

58:08.905 --> 58:10.440
- It has to be his car.

58:11.670 --> 58:12.482
Where else?

58:12.517 --> 58:15.349
What the fuck do we do then?

58:15.384 --> 58:18.146
I don't know, just wait.

58:18.181 --> 58:19.443
I mean it's possible.

58:19.478 --> 58:20.706
- Oh my God.
- Shit.

58:22.360 --> 58:23.484
- Sarah?
- Yes, that's me.

58:23.519 --> 58:24.585
Hi sir.

58:24.620 --> 58:26.250
- Okay, have him turn
off that camera right now

58:26.285 --> 58:27.075
or I'm outta here.

58:27.110 --> 58:28.583
Okay, Kyle turn it off.

58:30.550 --> 58:33.050
Do you have a fresh battery tested?

58:33.085 --> 58:34.477
Yep, ready to go.

58:36.787 --> 58:39.616
- What do you really know
about the shadow people?

58:39.651 --> 58:40.449
I mean really.

58:43.190 --> 58:44.673
Yeah, nothing I take it.

58:48.797 --> 58:50.695
- I know about them.

58:50.730 --> 58:55.090
- Okay, do you really think
that you're the only people

58:55.125 --> 58:56.633
who tried to document this?

58:57.660 --> 58:59.750
- Seriously, who else has?

58:59.785 --> 59:00.583
- Exactly.

59:03.960 --> 59:05.105
- What do you mean?

59:05.140 --> 59:07.455
- What I mean is, they were here one day

59:07.490 --> 59:11.400
and then all of a sudden they
were gone, they disappeared.

59:11.435 --> 59:12.603
Do you get that part?

59:12.638 --> 59:13.621
- What do you mean?

59:13.656 --> 59:14.570
- They were gone.

59:14.605 --> 59:16.160
- What do you mean they disappeared?

59:16.195 --> 59:17.775
- Okay.

59:17.810 --> 59:20.870
I'm gonna show you something one time

59:20.905 --> 59:22.685
and only one time.

59:22.720 --> 59:25.013
This is a video that was never online.

59:26.530 --> 59:31.080
My security camera
recorded this in my office.

59:31.115 --> 59:31.935
I'm gonna show it to you,

59:31.970 --> 59:34.053
but I'm only gonna show it one time.

59:36.310 --> 59:38.265
And I don't want this being filmed.

59:38.300 --> 59:39.105
- Right.

59:39.140 --> 59:41.433
- So they're gonna have
to shut the camera off.

59:47.144 --> 59:48.438
- Who is that?

59:48.473 --> 59:49.733
- Just watch.

59:52.085 --> 59:53.880
- What's he doing?

59:53.915 --> 59:54.993
- Just watch.

59:57.030 --> 59:59.033
- Oh my God.
- Holy shit.

01:00:00.151 --> 01:00:01.433
= What the fuck happened?

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.966
Can we please just watch it one more time?

01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:08.253
- No, I said one time,
I'm gonna delete it.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:14.207
- Dude, so what
the fuck was it man?

01:00:14.242 --> 01:00:16.194
- It was so fucking freaky man.

01:00:16.229 --> 01:00:18.483
What was it?

01:00:18.518 --> 01:00:19.749
Well, tell me what you saw man.

01:00:19.784 --> 01:00:20.945
Tell me what the fuck you saw.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.055
- It was surveillance
video and it looked like

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:27.095
it was taken, it was
like a camera mounted on

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:31.150
a building across from a
building, maybe five stories

01:00:31.185 --> 01:00:33.250
and the camera was probably 100 yards away

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:39.120
and you see this guy walking on a ledge

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:44.410
and you could see his
skin, you could kinda

01:00:44.445 --> 01:00:45.810
make out the pattern of his shirt,

01:00:45.845 --> 01:00:47.367
you think he's gonna jump.

01:00:47.402 --> 01:00:48.200
That's what I thought.

01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:50.295
- Yeah, he looks like he's gonna jump

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:52.753
'cause why else would you
be walking on the ledge

01:00:52.788 --> 01:00:55.177
of this building for no
fucking reason in the middle

01:00:55.212 --> 01:00:58.570
of the fucking day, and out of nowhere

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.995
comes like shadow.

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:04.700
- Oh, fucking stop.
- Like fucking shadow man.

01:01:04.735 --> 01:01:07.169
No shit, I'm not fucking kidding.

01:01:07.204 --> 01:01:08.495
- I swear to God.
- Get the fuck out of here.

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:11.135
- And you think because
of the way he just pops up

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:13.740
and he's right next to
him, it looked like he was

01:01:13.775 --> 01:01:15.707
gonna fucking push him, did it not?

01:01:15.742 --> 01:01:16.505
Yeah.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.338
- I thought he was gonna push him.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:18.654
That's exactly what I thought.

01:01:18.689 --> 01:01:20.730
- That's what you're gonna go
with, that's what I go with.

01:01:20.765 --> 01:01:22.233
Is he gonna push him.

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:27.823
So they just looked
like they were talking.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.562
Then out of nowhere, bam, gone.

01:01:31.597 --> 01:01:32.542
Disappeared.

01:01:32.577 --> 01:01:34.475
Shut the fuck up.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:36.065
I swear on my life.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.147
I swear on my life, he just disappeared.

01:01:38.182 --> 01:01:39.860
- Listen, all that
shit can be faked so easy.

01:01:39.895 --> 01:01:41.635
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:46.020
- Yeah, dude I've seen a
lot of fake shit, I agree,

01:01:46.055 --> 01:01:48.205
but this did not look fake.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.950
At all.

01:02:17.251 --> 01:02:21.267
# I'm happy only if I wanna be #

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:25.001
# I don't ever want to leave #

01:02:25.036 --> 01:02:28.700
# I'm in a perfect world #

01:02:33.372 --> 01:02:34.455
Kyle.

01:02:37.802 --> 01:02:40.459
# I eat my dinner in a bathtub #

01:02:40.494 --> 01:02:42.408
# Then I go to sex clubs #

01:02:42.443 --> 01:02:44.322
# Watching freaky people #

01:02:44.357 --> 01:02:46.352
# Getting it on #

01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:23.057
It's like a rain forest.

01:03:25.257 --> 01:03:28.478
- What the bloody hell
you doing with that mate?

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.406
- Look at you, you so mad right now.

01:03:30.441 --> 01:03:32.105
Look at the teeth on the monkey

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.735
He's trying to reach at your face.

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:35.720
Look at him trying to reach out on you.

01:03:37.803 --> 01:03:39.917
He's on your face, Sarah.

01:03:43.329 --> 01:03:45.996
- That's so creepy, get him off.

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:48.970
I can't, I don't know what to do.

01:03:49.864 --> 01:03:51.786
I don't know what to do.

01:03:51.821 --> 01:03:53.673
- It's probably a spider.

01:03:53.708 --> 01:03:54.720
- I can't let go of
my camera, I'm a cameraman.

01:03:54.755 --> 01:03:56.313
Get her eyeball.

01:04:15.701 --> 01:04:18.868
Shall we get it coming in slow motion?

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:09.019
Turn left onto Airport Road.

01:05:09.054 --> 01:05:12.083
In a quarter mile, turn
left onto US-64 West.

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:20.838
It's pretty warm.

01:05:20.873 --> 01:05:22.256
It's warm?

01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:23.639
- Yeah.

01:05:30.495 --> 01:05:32.333
I missed my mouth.

01:05:32.368 --> 01:05:34.482
Sarah's messy.

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:39.995
- This is amazing.

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:41.925
Please be careful Sarah.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.040
I can't save you 'cause
I gotta hold the camera.

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:46.240
So if you go, that's it.

01:05:47.103 --> 01:05:48.376
That's it Sarah.

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:49.452
Jesus, please.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:50.493
Oh God no.

01:06:10.452 --> 01:06:13.285
Oh my God, look at this.

01:06:19.197 --> 01:06:20.763
Woo.

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:31.181
Oh my God.

01:06:31.216 --> 01:06:33.113
Wow, dude.

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:35.915
That is so sick.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:39.170
I can't even begin to tell
you how incredible this looks.

01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:40.797
All right, I gotta get you into this.

01:06:40.832 --> 01:06:42.365
This is your documentary.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.315
- My quest.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:46.985
Yes, quest for the truth.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.620
- Adventure.
- Adventure?

01:06:53.145 --> 01:06:54.867
- Sasquatch walking.

01:06:54.902 --> 01:06:56.228
Go.

01:07:24.225 --> 01:07:26.707
Boom, I'm fucking shooting again.

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:29.040
Point seven miles.

01:07:45.663 --> 01:07:46.951
- It's fucking hot.

01:07:46.986 --> 01:07:48.571
Look at that ceiling.

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:50.156
Show them that ceiling.

01:07:52.649 --> 01:07:54.833
Part of the deal of us
staying in this room

01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:56.015
is we gotta fix it.

01:07:59.355 --> 01:08:01.455
Look they shoved like toilet paper.

01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:03.520
No, that's not toilet paper.

01:08:03.555 --> 01:08:05.844
- It's toilet paper
shoved in that hole.

01:08:05.879 --> 01:08:11.353
Look at that big fucking dog.

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:12.436
Dog.

01:08:13.719 --> 01:08:16.603
I didn't bring my light either.

01:08:16.638 --> 01:08:18.435
Honest to fucking God.

01:08:21.712 --> 01:08:22.712
Oh poor guy.

01:08:39.595 --> 01:08:42.136
Oh Jesus, Joseph.

01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:43.456
Did he already go to sleep?

01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:44.368
- Yeah.

01:08:44.404 --> 01:08:46.654
Are you kidding me?

01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:50.845
We're in the middle of nowhere right now.

01:08:50.881 --> 01:08:52.120
Oh shit dude that's bull.

01:08:52.154 --> 01:08:53.850
- What part is this?

01:08:53.885 --> 01:08:55.100
Let go.

01:08:57.962 --> 01:09:00.064
- Tell him to fuck off man.
- How do you like it?

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.361
- What the fuck are you guys doing?

01:09:01.395 --> 01:09:02.158
What time is it?

01:09:02.194 --> 01:09:04.545
It's time to get up.

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:08.082
- Jesus Christ dude, we slept
like fucking three hours.

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:09.773
Well,

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:13.792
this fly up here.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.755
What are you looking for?

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:18.660
- This fly up
here, he's been sleeping

01:09:18.694 --> 01:09:20.745
all night watching you.

01:09:20.779 --> 01:09:22.796
Oh shit that was red.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.497
Rebel.

01:09:26.533 --> 01:09:28.790
Good thing we got Florida tags.

01:09:28.825 --> 01:09:30.545
Look at that shit.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.680
What else you got in there?

01:09:32.715 --> 01:09:34.745
- I got my porn videos.

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:37.210
- Really, you have
to bring it with you?

01:09:37.245 --> 01:09:38.680
It's that bad dude, holy shit.

01:09:38.715 --> 01:09:40.080
It's an addiction.

01:09:40.115 --> 01:09:41.060
That is an issue.

01:09:41.095 --> 01:09:41.893
- What's up.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.447
Cap, take that.

01:09:48.283 --> 01:09:49.572
- I got like
crazy doing a Superman.

01:09:49.607 --> 01:09:51.404
Upper cut bud.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:56.821
All right.

01:10:19.226 --> 01:10:20.780
She likes to stand on that cliff.

01:10:20.815 --> 01:10:21.578
- No bashing.

01:10:21.613 --> 01:10:24.444
Sarah, no, what the hell?

01:10:24.479 --> 01:10:27.276
This one's shaky Joey.

01:10:51.212 --> 01:10:56.212
# I can seem to get you #

01:10:56.633 --> 01:10:59.981
# Off of my mind #

01:11:00.016 --> 01:11:03.329
# And that's fine #

01:11:10.572 --> 01:11:15.309
# I can't seem to get you #

01:11:15.344 --> 01:11:18.680
# Off of my mind #

01:11:18.715 --> 01:11:22.017
# And that's fine #

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.530
- What's that movie where the
guy gets stuck in the rock.

01:11:31.565 --> 01:11:34.668
24 or 200 hours.

01:11:34.703 --> 01:11:38.173
200 hours, 24 days.

01:11:39.338 --> 01:11:40.136
24 days.

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.201
The first 24.

01:11:42.236 --> 01:11:44.418
The first 48, nine and a half weeks.

01:11:44.453 --> 01:11:46.600
That's definitely not it.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:47.705
Seven days.

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.273
Hey deer, deer.

01:12:03.416 --> 01:12:06.850
- You want me to get a
picture of you doing that?

01:12:06.885 --> 01:12:08.833
She's just trying to get in the picture.

01:12:08.868 --> 01:12:10.781
Hang on, let me get a picture of you.

01:12:10.816 --> 01:12:13.698
I'll send it to you on Facebook.

01:12:13.733 --> 01:12:15.115
Take you top off.

01:12:17.521 --> 01:12:18.938
- I'll put this right
on you while you're eat

01:12:18.973 --> 01:12:19.771
the entire time.

01:12:42.531 --> 01:12:43.452
Onyx.

01:12:43.487 --> 01:12:45.404
That's wicked.

01:13:05.698 --> 01:13:09.128
- There's no point
flying to Lookout Mountain.

01:13:09.163 --> 01:13:11.663
To travel
in Lookout Mountain

01:13:11.698 --> 01:13:14.128
as well as

01:13:14.163 --> 01:13:18.328
and the Chattanooga National
Military Battlefield.

01:13:18.363 --> 01:13:21.410
Traveling up the mountain,
you'll find the air is cooler

01:13:21.445 --> 01:13:23.575
since there's an approximate eight degree

01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:26.811
temperature difference
between Chattanooga Valley

01:13:26.846 --> 01:13:28.523
and Lookout Mountain.

01:13:28.558 --> 01:13:30.165
The incline of the track

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.300
at the steepest point at the top is 72.7%,

01:13:35.393 --> 01:13:38.102
giving the incline the unique distinction

01:13:38.137 --> 01:13:42.554
of being the steepest
passenger railway in the world.

01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:03.738
- Hey, you're rolling right?

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:04.536
What's that?

01:14:04.571 --> 01:14:05.404
- You're rolling?

01:14:05.439 --> 01:14:06.202
Yeah.

01:14:06.237 --> 01:14:08.135
- We are in Tennessee right now.

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:11.230
We are on our way to our last interview.

01:14:11.265 --> 01:14:12.580
This is Miss Stephanie Yost

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:18.413
Miss Yost and I really believe,
I think it's going to be

01:14:18.448 --> 01:14:19.763
a really interesting story.

01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:22.150
I sure hope so.

01:14:23.127 --> 01:14:24.965
- Why do you say that?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.163
Most of them suck man, honestly.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.540
And if the dude would have
showed us the security camera

01:14:32.575 --> 01:14:35.187
footage that you guys saw,
that may have been cool,

01:14:35.222 --> 01:14:37.765
but because the camera
couldn't see any of that,

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.550
I mean it's not making much
of an impact for your film.

01:14:40.585 --> 01:14:42.872
- But honestly can we just
have this positive attitude

01:14:42.907 --> 01:14:45.160
about it though 'cause I
feel the more we dwell on it

01:14:45.195 --> 01:14:47.115
the more, we got what we got.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:50.515
- You said you'd
do this project with her.

01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:55.080
You got me involved, I'm
involved and whether or not

01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:58.025
we're all gonna go off and write memoirs

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:02.327
about our experience
together one day or not,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.070
we need to be civil and we
need to be focused on the goal.

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:09.868
What's the goal?

01:15:09.903 --> 01:15:11.135
It's to create our best work.

01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:14.680
Your best work as a cameraman,
my best work as an audio guy

01:15:14.715 --> 01:15:16.485
and a motivational speaker.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.385
- I'll be honest guys, I'll be honest,

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:20.215
I have not been a good interviewer.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:24.508
I feel like I've been
nervous and it's different

01:15:24.543 --> 01:15:25.880
when you're actually interviewing somebody

01:15:25.915 --> 01:15:27.580
and you're feeling their emotions.

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:30.575
I forget how I'm gonna say my question.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:33.077
You don't wanna come off, you
don't want to offend them,

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.635
you don't wanna say too much.

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:36.124
You don't say too little.

01:15:36.159 --> 01:15:38.290
- Yeah, but you gotta
understand too though man

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:39.815
this is your one shot.

01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:42.043
This is it, so you have
to make the best of it.

01:15:42.078 --> 01:15:44.284
- I know, that's going
back to not being negative.

01:15:44.319 --> 01:15:46.455
- And the truth
be told, who gives a fuck

01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:49.485
because even if you offend
them, something like

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:54.000
the damn Mr. Philips dude
can walk in and completely

01:15:54.035 --> 01:15:55.173
take it away.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:58.880
So if you get robbed of
it, you might as well

01:15:58.915 --> 01:16:00.790
get what you can out of these people

01:16:00.825 --> 01:16:01.790
when you have the chance.

01:16:01.825 --> 01:16:02.623
- But what-

01:16:04.882 --> 01:16:06.260
- I mean just like
no limits, no limitations.

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:07.745
No limits.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.895
Just ask them everything

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:10.848
because that's what people wanna see.

01:16:10.883 --> 01:16:12.767
You got us lost didn't you?

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:13.565
No I didn't.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.875
- What's the map say?

01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:16.510
- I'm trying to figure that out.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.398
We're lost.

01:16:18.433 --> 01:16:20.121
- Joe, shut the fuck up.

01:16:20.156 --> 01:16:21.810
We just need options.

01:16:21.845 --> 01:16:24.053
We're not lost.

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:27.938
Is this it?

01:16:27.973 --> 01:16:29.015
No, Kyle.

01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:29.848
I swear to God.

01:16:29.883 --> 01:16:32.063
- Well, there's a
fucking house right there.

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:35.265
Well then where the fuck is it?

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.880
You said it was right off
of the highway, Sarah.

01:16:37.915 --> 01:16:38.808
I'm looking at my map right now,

01:16:38.843 --> 01:16:41.370
it's telling me to keep going straight.

01:16:41.405 --> 01:16:42.975
Oh my God.

01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:44.534
Is that her?

01:16:44.569 --> 01:16:46.569
Yeah, I think that's it.

01:16:50.619 --> 01:16:51.452
Is that her?

01:16:51.487 --> 01:16:52.250
Yep.

01:16:52.285 --> 01:16:53.785
All right.

01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:57.560
- She doesn't really look happy.

01:16:57.595 --> 01:16:58.423
I don't know.

01:17:03.482 --> 01:17:05.607
- Nice to meet you, this is my crew.

01:17:05.642 --> 01:17:07.252
- I see that.

01:17:07.287 --> 01:17:09.237
Are you ready to get started?

01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:12.745
You wanna set up in there?

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.130
- Now look I don't know you.

01:17:14.165 --> 01:17:15.487
I said I'd do this interview,

01:17:15.522 --> 01:17:16.810
but you're not going in my house.

01:17:16.845 --> 01:17:17.802
- Okay, that's fine.

01:17:17.837 --> 01:17:20.135
Are you fine doing it out front?

01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:21.135
- Yeah, that's fine.

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:27.810
- So you were the oldest out
of three siblings, correct?

01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:31.683
- Yes, it was me, my sister
Ann, and my brother Robert.

01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:35.695
- Were your
mother and father around?

01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:38.610
- My father left about a
year after Ann went missing.

01:17:38.645 --> 01:17:39.753
Why did he leave?

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.640
- I just think he didn't want
to deal with this anymore.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.065
- So after that happened,

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.963
how long until Robert went missing?

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.060
- Robert would have turned 10 that year,

01:17:54.095 --> 01:17:55.823
so about two years after Ann.

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:02.663
- What do you think happened
to your brother and sister?

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:06.893
- Well Ann was the first to see it.

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.365
She used to wake up
screaming a lot at night.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.510
She said there was a shadow
man living in her room.

01:18:14.545 --> 01:18:15.885
But nobody believed her.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.270
It was never anything
that we could see anyway.

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:25.380
And several months after
that, she was just taken

01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:27.180
right out of her bed.

01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:30.900
And soon after that, Robert started

01:18:30.935 --> 01:18:32.173
to have the same visions.

01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:36.125
Robert had a really tough time of it.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.670
He used to say that it would
hold him down in his bed

01:18:39.705 --> 01:18:40.820
and not let him get up.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.972
Robert just started to loose it

01:18:45.007 --> 01:18:47.398
and that's about the same time my dad

01:18:47.433 --> 01:18:49.493
had his breaking point.

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.590
Not long after that, Robert disappeared

01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:55.673
the same way Ann did.

01:18:59.017 --> 01:19:02.223
We just woke up one
morning and he was gone.

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:08.769
The police thought my
mom and dad had something

01:19:08.804 --> 01:19:11.095
to do with it and honestly
at first I wasn't so sure.

01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:14.080
I thought maybe my dad came
back and took him or something.

01:19:16.014 --> 01:19:19.397
But that very night something
woke me out of my sleep

01:19:19.432 --> 01:19:22.780
and there was a shadow
standing at the end of my bed.

01:19:23.976 --> 01:19:27.463
It didn't have any features,
it was just a black figure.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.570
I just started screaming for my mom

01:19:30.605 --> 01:19:32.445
at the top of my lungs.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.989
It just stood there until my
mom came running into the room

01:19:36.024 --> 01:19:38.439
and turned on the lights
and then it disappeared.

01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:43.593
Anyway, my mom packed a
suitcase and we left that night.

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.965
We went and lived with
her brother for a while

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.790
until we could get on our
own feet, but never went

01:19:50.825 --> 01:19:52.240
back to the house ever again.

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:58.853
I haven't seen the shadow ever since.

01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:03.020
- What happened to the house
and all the stuff in it?

01:20:03.947 --> 01:20:05.305
- It's still there.

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.790
I mean it's been abandoned for 30 years,

01:20:07.825 --> 01:20:08.840
but it's still there.

01:20:10.288 --> 01:20:12.865
We have a cousin that goes
over and cuts the grass

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.823
every of often, but it's
pretty much falling apart now.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.575
Where is the house?

01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:21.060
- It's a few miles from here.

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:23.233
- Are you serious?

01:20:24.372 --> 01:20:25.882
Can we go over there?

01:20:25.917 --> 01:20:27.393
Just to get some footage.

01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:30.165
- Did you not hear what I just said?

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.820
I haven't been back there in 30 years.

01:20:31.855 --> 01:20:33.447
I'm sure as hell not going back now.

01:20:33.482 --> 01:20:35.040
- Okay, I completely understand.

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:38.240
Would it be okay if I
bring my crew over there.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.290
- You shouldn't go there.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.875
- Miss Yost, it would
be incredible footage

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:50.810
for this interview if
we can go over there.

01:20:51.817 --> 01:20:52.873
- Are you sure?

01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:57.600
It's on the main road you came in on.

01:20:57.635 --> 01:20:59.513
It's about three miles back.

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.650
56 Pearson Road.

01:21:01.685 --> 01:21:02.880
- 56 Pearson Road.

01:21:04.175 --> 01:21:05.008
Thank you.

01:21:07.661 --> 01:21:08.774
- You shouldn't go.

01:21:08.809 --> 01:21:13.226
- Listen, I can't tell you
how much this means to us.

01:21:14.563 --> 01:21:16.754
This is gonna be wonderful.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:20.863
Anything that happened to
you, I couldn't be more sorry.

01:21:22.781 --> 01:21:24.114
Thank you again.

01:21:36.606 --> 01:21:39.077
I didn't know it was this.

01:21:39.112 --> 01:21:39.910
- Oh, oh.

01:21:41.677 --> 01:21:42.993
I lost my cigarette.

01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:46.773
Pull up.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.823
Yeah, just pull up through here.

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:52.545
Or what used to be a pool.

01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:54.298
Oh my God.

01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:56.017
Whoa.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.066
- God-damn dude.
- What do you think?

01:22:00.101 --> 01:22:01.064
Right here?

01:22:01.099 --> 01:22:02.516
I guess.

01:22:04.916 --> 01:22:06.380
- You guys wanna take a swim

01:22:06.415 --> 01:22:07.268
Yeah.

01:22:07.303 --> 01:22:08.353
It looks pretty refreshing.

01:22:09.228 --> 01:22:10.840
- It's 90 degrees
out, are you kidding me?

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:12.600
I got my swim trunks on under this.

01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:28.393
- Wow, they have
everything still in there.

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:36.538
Is there still shit in there?

01:22:36.573 --> 01:22:38.560
What do you think Kyle?

01:22:39.683 --> 01:22:41.483
This is fucking crazy dude.

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.940
Oh my God, dude, look at that.

01:22:50.187 --> 01:22:52.365
Look at that shot dude.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.733
Oh my God, how fucking
creepy is that shit.

01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:58.792
Look at those God-damn
dolls sitting over there.

01:22:58.827 --> 01:23:00.458
- It's like a nun's home. I'm short.

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:03.743
Let's do this.

01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:07.935
Make sure we figure out.

01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:09.908
- I can't really
fucking see anything.

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:11.582
You can't see anything?

01:23:11.617 --> 01:23:14.245
No, it's pitch black in there.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.873
All I can see is your reflection.

01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:20.915
- Right now I'm in Tennessee
and right behind me

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:24.020
is the actual house where the
Yost children went missing.

01:23:24.055 --> 01:23:26.663
They say that the shadow
men had taken the children.

01:23:28.138 --> 01:23:29.038
Will you cut that?

01:23:31.545 --> 01:23:32.503
Whenever you're ready.

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.860
- Right now I'm in Tennessee,
documenting the disappearance

01:23:36.895 --> 01:23:37.685
of the Yost children.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.575
Right behind me is the
actual house of where

01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:42.385
the children went missing

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:44.650
and the family members seem to believe

01:23:44.685 --> 01:23:46.574
that the shadow people are responsible

01:23:46.609 --> 01:23:48.463
for the disappearance of the children.

01:23:49.671 --> 01:23:50.705
Is that all right?

01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.528
- It was good.
- It was good.

01:23:52.563 --> 01:23:53.326
- Are you sure?

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.933
- Please, ladies and
gentlemen watch your heads.

01:23:58.224 --> 01:23:59.022
What?

01:23:59.057 --> 01:24:01.482
It's sharp.

01:24:01.517 --> 01:24:03.333
Oh, sharp little fuckers.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:16.653
Was that necessary?

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:20.413
What the fuck you doing?

01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:28.025
Oh shit.

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:28.995
What?

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:30.226
It's open.

01:24:30.261 --> 01:24:32.501
Guys, we're not going in.

01:24:32.536 --> 01:24:34.084
We're not going in.

01:24:35.076 --> 01:24:37.275
- Look, are you serious?

01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:39.380
- She never actually
said we could go in,

01:24:39.415 --> 01:24:41.840
she said we could go to the location.

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:42.840
- Nobody lives here.

01:24:43.675 --> 01:24:45.732
- I'm aware of that, we're not going in.

01:24:45.767 --> 01:24:47.790
- The house is unlocked,
the house is open.

01:24:47.825 --> 01:24:48.625
- That's breaking and enter.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.600
- Sarah, it's no
breaking and entering,

01:24:50.635 --> 01:24:51.398
the fucking door's open.

01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:54.138
- Yes, I know the door's
open, we're not going in.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:55.336
That's not breaking and entering.

01:24:55.371 --> 01:24:56.499
- Not if anybody doesn't come here,

01:24:56.534 --> 01:24:57.783
it doesn't fucking matter.

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:00.685
- Sarah.
- No, that's no right.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.501
What are you talking about?

01:25:02.536 --> 01:25:04.283
We gotta fucking do this.

01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:07.665
- I just don't feel right going in.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:11.233
- Listen to me, if
you can't go in this house,

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:14.865
then you're not cut out for
fucking filmmaking, man.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.575
You're not cut out for this shit.

01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:20.430
Honestly, this is what
filmmakers do, we take risks.

01:25:20.465 --> 01:25:22.312
We get shots.

01:25:22.347 --> 01:25:25.570
That's what we do, that's
what this is all about.

01:25:25.605 --> 01:25:28.370
- He's right, we're here to make a movie

01:25:28.405 --> 01:25:29.295
about the shadow man.

01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:31.256
- Okay, fuck it, let's do it.

01:25:31.291 --> 01:25:33.148
Let's fucking do this.

01:25:33.183 --> 01:25:35.563
I wanna be in and out.

01:25:35.598 --> 01:25:36.524
In and out.

01:25:36.559 --> 01:25:38.283
Hello?

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:40.640
There's nobody here.

01:25:42.107 --> 01:25:43.943
Well I don't fucking know.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:50.560
Holy shit this is like walking
into a fucking time warp man.

01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:53.053
Look how old this shit is.

01:26:03.045 --> 01:26:08.045
Holy shit that's fucking creepy dude.

01:26:08.152 --> 01:26:09.652
Come on.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.130
First of all we're breaking and entering

01:26:12.165 --> 01:26:13.005
and then I feel like-

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.070
- Sarah, we are
not breaking and entering.

01:26:15.105 --> 01:26:17.679
What did we break to get in here?

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:19.338
We didn't break anything.

01:26:19.373 --> 01:26:21.035
Look at these old wine bottles.

01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:23.130
I can't even see this
shit, it's so fucking dark.

01:26:23.165 --> 01:26:24.725
Don't touch anything.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.483
- We should drink some
of this fucking wine dude.

01:26:36.663 --> 01:26:37.890
This place really isn't in
that bad of shape is it?

01:26:37.925 --> 01:26:39.783
- Somebody made
the beds really well.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.920
- No, so they just
fucking picked up and left

01:26:45.955 --> 01:26:47.533
all their shit here, huh?

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.210
Woo, it's creepy in here.

01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:56.923
Let me get the fuck out of here seriously.

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.013
Oh shit.

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:06.740
- Okay, you got
your footage, let's go.

01:27:06.775 --> 01:27:07.863
Dude, listen.

01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:11.180
I got a fucking idea.

01:27:13.930 --> 01:27:15.400
You're not gonna like it.

01:27:15.435 --> 01:27:16.675
What?

01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:18.740
She definitely doesn't
wanna hear this shit.

01:27:18.775 --> 01:27:20.835
I probably don't, what?

01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:24.070
- Dude, we need
to stay in here tonight.

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:24.868
Hell no.

01:27:24.903 --> 01:27:26.401
I'm fucking serious man.

01:27:26.436 --> 01:27:27.865
Listen to me, listen to me.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.730
If we stay in here, I've got
my little fucking sports cam

01:27:30.765 --> 01:27:32.727
that I can put up around the house

01:27:32.762 --> 01:27:34.655
and do like security cam footage

01:27:34.690 --> 01:27:36.425
and we can fucking monitor wirelessly.

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:37.603
- I'm not fucking
staying here Kyle.

01:27:37.638 --> 01:27:39.155
What if we get

01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:41.000
the fucking shadow fucking man in here,

01:27:41.035 --> 01:27:43.335
can you imagine that?

01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:46.230
It would be the most incredible footage

01:27:46.265 --> 01:27:48.118
you've gotten yet period.

01:27:48.153 --> 01:27:49.591
He's right.

01:27:49.626 --> 01:27:50.885
- You actually?

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.109
Really, you think?

01:27:52.144 --> 01:27:55.943
- Against my best judgment he's right.

01:27:57.012 --> 01:27:59.843
Even if to just have the footage.

01:27:59.878 --> 01:28:02.210
- What if there was a
chance, just a chance

01:28:02.245 --> 01:28:04.842
that the shadow man is here.

01:28:04.877 --> 01:28:07.440
Wouldn't you want to get that.

01:28:07.475 --> 01:28:08.435
Come on.

01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:10.535
You've left every scenario.

01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:12.600
We've had the chance to get it

01:28:12.635 --> 01:28:13.800
and we didn't take it.

01:28:13.835 --> 01:28:15.297
Let's take it.

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:16.725
Sarah.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.813
I don't see the harm.

01:28:18.848 --> 01:28:20.940
If someone comes and tells
us to go, we'll tell them

01:28:20.975 --> 01:28:22.583
what we're doing and we'll leave.

01:28:24.238 --> 01:28:27.570
There's nothing that's gonna happen.

01:28:27.605 --> 01:28:29.292
That's the worst case scenario.

01:28:29.327 --> 01:28:32.085
Sarah, come on.

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.610
- The worst case scenario
is nothing happens

01:28:33.645 --> 01:28:34.590
and we stay in a stinking whole house.

01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:36.125
- You guys are fucking insane.

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.514
Yeah, but come on, come on.

01:28:38.549 --> 01:28:40.869
Come on Sarah, come on Sarah.

01:28:40.904 --> 01:28:42.036
Sarah!
- Sarah!

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:46.595
That's a yes.

01:28:46.630 --> 01:28:50.120
- I see a yes, that
looks like a yes face to me.

01:28:50.155 --> 01:28:51.475
Dude check it out, I got great,

01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:53.435
listen man, I'll put a
fucking security camera

01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:55.969
right up here, we'll put a
little fucking sports cam,

01:28:56.004 --> 01:28:58.468
we'll shoot this whole
fucking area, put another one

01:28:58.503 --> 01:28:59.381
in the back.

01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:00.225
- One up there.

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.385
- [kyle[ Yeah Dude. We
can shoot this whole area.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.510
- Now there's not gonna be
audio on any of that shit,

01:29:04.545 --> 01:29:05.455
but still I mean.

01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:07.579
- They don't have any running water.

01:29:07.614 --> 01:29:10.140
- No, there's no fucking
power or anything in here.

01:29:10.175 --> 01:29:11.086
What do you mean?

01:29:11.121 --> 01:29:11.963
Take a shower?

01:29:11.998 --> 01:29:15.134
- Yeah and to go to the bathroom.

01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:16.730
Go outside.

01:29:16.765 --> 01:29:17.528
- No.

01:29:17.563 --> 01:29:18.585
So we're fucking doing it.

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.876
- Let's do it, let's get set up.

01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:21.577
Let's fucking do it. Yes, man.

01:29:21.612 --> 01:29:22.410
Sarah.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.153
We're doing it.

01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:27.035
We're fucking doing it Sarah.

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:30.000
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here

01:29:30.035 --> 01:29:31.665
is our sports cam.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:36.470
Also going to be our
security camera footage.

01:29:36.505 --> 01:29:37.303
We're

01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:41.930
this entire area here with the hallway

01:29:41.965 --> 01:29:44.715
and a portion of the living room and den.

01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:46.530
Thank you for joining us
Sarah. We're going ahead.

01:29:46.565 --> 01:29:48.734
We're walking through the process now.

01:29:48.769 --> 01:29:51.141
A matter of fact what we're going to need

01:29:51.176 --> 01:29:53.513
to go ahead and do is mount that one.

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.283
I'll show you, I'll show you later.

01:29:56.318 --> 01:29:58.750
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna mount another one

01:29:59.872 --> 01:30:01.772
right up in this general area in here.

01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:08.440
The living room as well,
so it will be well covered

01:30:08.475 --> 01:30:09.900
for this general area.

01:30:09.935 --> 01:30:10.733
Unfortunately,

01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:15.820
so we'll need to out it back here

01:30:15.855 --> 01:30:17.834
and I think our best bet is.

01:30:17.869 --> 01:30:18.667
How many of those do you have?

01:30:18.702 --> 01:30:20.335
- Three, three, so
we'll have this one here

01:30:20.370 --> 01:30:22.630
covering the living room, that
one back there in the den,

01:30:22.665 --> 01:30:26.430
covering that area, and that one will also

01:30:26.465 --> 01:30:27.785
cover this hallway.

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:31.343
So I've got another one
mounted here already.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:41.350
So with that said, we're pretty
well covered in the house.

01:30:41.385 --> 01:30:44.682
What we'll do is we'll
wirelessly transmit the signal

01:30:44.717 --> 01:30:47.783
to a program I have and
we'll be able to wirelessly

01:30:47.818 --> 01:30:50.850
watch all the security
camera footage as we sit

01:30:50.885 --> 01:30:51.756
in the comfort of the kitchen.

01:30:51.791 --> 01:30:52.606
- What about batteries?

01:30:52.641 --> 01:30:53.387
Are the batteries good?

01:30:53.422 --> 01:30:56.520
- Every four hours we'll
have to put new batteries in.

01:30:56.555 --> 01:30:58.020
But we're pretty well covered.

01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:31.750
Joe can you hear anything?

01:31:31.785 --> 01:31:33.083
Nothing.

01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:42.170
So maybe it's all for nothing.

01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:43.320
Let's hope not.

01:31:58.619 --> 01:32:03.619
- I'm about to go lay in
one of those fucking beds.

01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:04.453
- Yeah.

01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:08.025
I'm tired.

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.117
- Yeah, me too.

01:32:12.327 --> 01:32:14.655
But we didn't come here to sleep.

01:32:14.690 --> 01:32:16.983
We came here to get something.

01:32:18.877 --> 01:32:21.750
Yep, trust me I'm tired too.

01:32:30.642 --> 01:32:32.353
Joe let me look at this shit man.

01:32:33.206 --> 01:32:34.039
- Yeah.

01:32:45.630 --> 01:32:47.425
I gotta pee.

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:48.360
So go pee.

01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:52.004
Will one of you come with me?

01:32:52.039 --> 01:32:54.406
What, can't you go pee alone?

01:32:54.441 --> 01:32:56.773
- I mean someone walk with me.

01:32:59.910 --> 01:33:01.890
Kyle will you go with her?

01:33:01.925 --> 01:33:02.723
Please.

01:33:04.314 --> 01:33:05.112
Come on man.

01:33:05.147 --> 01:33:07.207
I'm too lazy and tired to get up.

01:33:09.630 --> 01:33:10.428
Seriously?

01:33:10.463 --> 01:33:11.655
- Yeah, walk with me.

01:33:11.690 --> 01:33:12.848
Stand outside the door.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.583
Good lord.

01:33:18.209 --> 01:33:19.292
Jesus Christ.

01:33:26.981 --> 01:33:28.821
I don't wanna fucking walk back here.

01:33:28.856 --> 01:33:30.680
Do you want me to come in
there and help you out?

01:33:30.715 --> 01:33:31.478
No.

01:33:31.513 --> 01:33:32.311
You sure?

01:33:32.346 --> 01:33:34.662
Yes.

01:33:34.697 --> 01:33:40.917
Oh it's so dark.

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:45.938
You still there?

01:33:45.973 --> 01:33:47.423
Yes, I'm still here.

01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:58.569
Are you fucking done yet?

01:33:58.604 --> 01:33:59.652
No.

01:34:02.055 --> 01:34:05.296
The shits.

01:34:05.331 --> 01:34:07.158
You gotta shit?

01:34:07.193 --> 01:34:08.418
I said I can't see shit.

01:34:08.453 --> 01:34:11.727
You said you gotta shit.

01:34:11.762 --> 01:34:12.560
Oh man.

01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:16.010
You guys, oh my God dude.

01:34:16.045 --> 01:34:16.843
What?

01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:22.870
- I just saw this
fucking stuffed animal move

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.920
or this doll.

01:34:24.955 --> 01:34:26.005
Stop it.

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:26.838
What?

01:34:26.873 --> 01:34:27.671
I'm not kidding.

01:34:27.706 --> 01:34:28.504
What happened?

01:34:28.539 --> 01:34:30.320
- Are you being
fucking serious man?

01:34:30.355 --> 01:34:31.165
Yes.

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:33.460
- He said a fucking
stuff animal moved.

01:34:33.495 --> 01:34:34.258
What happened?

01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:36.697
- He said a fucking
stuffed animal moved.

01:34:36.732 --> 01:34:37.792
Shut up.

01:34:37.827 --> 01:34:39.320
That's what he said.

01:34:41.135 --> 01:34:42.000
Joe you being serious?

01:34:42.035 --> 01:34:42.798
Yeah.

01:34:42.833 --> 01:34:43.901
Stop fucking around man.

01:34:43.936 --> 01:34:44.970
Check it out.

01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:50.900
Watch, I'll rewind it.

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:52.345
Where?

01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:53.400
Just keep watching.

01:34:53.435 --> 01:34:54.385
Where?

01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.234
- Did you see that
thing pop up? Watch.

01:34:56.269 --> 01:34:57.067
No, no, no, no.

01:34:58.930 --> 01:34:59.728
There it is.

01:34:59.763 --> 01:35:01.055
Oh my fucking God.

01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:02.055
Watch this thing.

01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:07.090
- Holy shit, no way,
get the fuck out of here.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.565
I wanna leave.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.596
Oh my God, no fucking way dude.

01:35:11.631 --> 01:35:14.218
I wanna leave.

01:35:14.253 --> 01:35:16.695
You guys I wanna leave.

01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:17.612
Kyle, Kyle.

01:35:18.597 --> 01:35:20.495
Holy shit man.

01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:23.760
Get the fuck out of here, that's insane.

01:35:23.795 --> 01:35:25.305
Kyle can we please leave.

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:26.588
What?

01:35:26.623 --> 01:35:28.827
- I feel, I feel really nauseous.

01:35:31.983 --> 01:35:33.885
Can we please leave?

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.175
Are you fucking serious?

01:35:35.210 --> 01:35:36.326
I wanna go right now.

01:35:36.361 --> 01:35:37.124
Let's go.

01:35:37.159 --> 01:35:37.992
Stop it.

01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:40.425
Just chill out.

01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:41.913
You gotta be kidding me.

01:35:47.987 --> 01:35:52.987
- I just don't feel
good about this right now.

01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:53.983
Sarah.

01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.693
Sarah.

01:35:59.447 --> 01:36:02.540
- You saw, you saw,
what we just looked at.

01:36:02.575 --> 01:36:05.227
How do you feel comfortable right now?

01:36:05.262 --> 01:36:07.845
Do you not feel a presence at all?

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.650
- Sarah this is
what we're here for.

01:36:10.685 --> 01:36:12.493
This is what we're here for.

01:36:14.532 --> 01:36:16.532
- I just feel so clammy.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.483
Sarah, come on, sit down.

01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:26.593
Just relax, just relax.

01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:30.913
Come on, hey, seriously.

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:32.923
Come sit down.

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.258
Come sit down.

01:36:35.293 --> 01:36:37.299
Come sit down. Seriously,
it's going to be okay.

01:36:37.334 --> 01:36:38.345
This is okay.

01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:39.950
Can you imagine what this is going to do

01:36:39.985 --> 01:36:41.572
for the documentary?

01:36:41.607 --> 01:36:43.125
Think about that.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.660
Think about that for a minute.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:46.905
Okay?

01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.205
Come on sit down, just sit down.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:51.125
Let's see what the fuck
else we can get man.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.313
- You guys, there's
something I never told you.

01:36:56.904 --> 01:36:57.702
What are you talking about?

01:36:57.737 --> 01:37:00.250
- This is the reason
I've been so intrigued

01:37:00.285 --> 01:37:01.403
with this documentary.

01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:11.103
- Sarah, what the
fuck are you talking about?

01:37:14.855 --> 01:37:17.055
- I should have told
you guys this actually.

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:34.500
When I was a little girl
about eight years old

01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:36.963
my dad left us.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.045
He sat me and the family
down at the table and said

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:48.090
that he never meant to hurt
us and he just had to leave

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:54.920
and about a year or so went
by and he came back home

01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:59.470
and I was under the impression that he was

01:37:59.505 --> 01:38:02.950
going to be back to normal, but he wasn't.

01:38:03.326 --> 01:38:05.295
I barely ever saw my dad.

01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:07.880
He kept himself locked in
his room most of the days

01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:10.135
and one night I walked in on him

01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:15.170
and he was talking to himself,
but nobody was in the room.

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:24.553
That same night I woke up
to a loud banging sound.

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:29.580
I shot up from my bed, I
looked down the hallway

01:38:29.615 --> 01:38:33.713
and I saw a shadow figure and it moved

01:38:36.483 --> 01:38:40.230
and all I did was blink and it was closer

01:38:41.490 --> 01:38:43.285
and obviously being actually terrified,

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.320
I put my head in my
covers and I shut my eyes

01:38:46.355 --> 01:38:49.320
and I felt like I was
under the covers for hours

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.483
knowing you're that scared
you can't even move.

01:38:56.778 --> 01:38:59.611
When I finally had the courage to.

01:39:03.082 --> 01:39:06.831
I feel so ill right now.

01:39:06.866 --> 01:39:10.120
When I finally had the courage
to get out from the covers

01:39:10.155 --> 01:39:13.460
it was shadows right over top of me

01:39:15.732 --> 01:39:19.930
and I just got up from my
bed, I ran down the hallway

01:39:19.965 --> 01:39:20.980
where my parents were

01:39:23.916 --> 01:39:25.980
and there was my dad dead.

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:31.350
You know what he did?

01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:34.343
He shot himself.

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:39.853
He shot himself.

01:39:47.075 --> 01:39:49.158
Why did he shoot himself?

01:39:56.438 --> 01:39:59.555
- Oh shit, did
you fucking hear that?

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.093
Oh my God dude.

01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:07.233
This fucking clock is on.

01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:10.405
Look at this.

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.695
It wasn't on before?

01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:13.493
No, I got a shot of it.

01:40:14.650 --> 01:40:16.860
I totally got a shot of this thing earlier

01:40:16.895 --> 01:40:18.923
when that motherfucker was not on.

01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:23.412
- All right, fuck it
I'm getting out of here.

01:40:23.447 --> 01:40:25.003
I'm getting out.

01:40:25.038 --> 01:40:26.209
Shit, I got that.

01:40:26.244 --> 01:40:27.345
I fucking got that.

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:30.020
- Kyle, I don't give a
fuck, I'm getting outta here.

01:40:30.055 --> 01:40:30.933
We're getting out right now.

01:40:30.968 --> 01:40:31.777
Are you guys serious?

01:40:31.812 --> 01:40:32.745
I'm packing up man.

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:34.830
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.370
You gotta be fucking kidding me man.

01:40:39.405 --> 01:40:42.055
Oh shit what the fuck was that?

01:40:42.090 --> 01:40:44.098
- Dude, I just saw the fucking door slam.

01:40:44.133 --> 01:40:46.106
- Where?
- I just saw it slam.

01:40:46.141 --> 01:40:47.047
Where?

01:40:47.082 --> 01:40:48.135
- Just saw it slam.

01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:48.933
In the back.

01:40:48.968 --> 01:40:49.993
Seriously.

01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.301
Kyle, don't go back there.

01:40:56.336 --> 01:40:57.235
Kyle.

01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:59.322
Oh my God Kyle.

01:40:59.357 --> 01:41:00.447
Kyle,

01:41:00.482 --> 01:41:01.538
Kyle.

01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:11.930
Go, go, go.

01:41:19.515 --> 01:41:21.520
Joe, Joe,

01:41:23.252 --> 01:41:25.277
Joe, where are you?

01:42:43.210 --> 01:42:47.775
# I'm holding my neck #

01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:52.810
# If blood rush through my fingers #

01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:57.259
# I don't feel #

01:42:57.294 --> 01:43:01.368
# But alive #

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:07.243
# I hardly feel like I could die #

01:43:13.419 --> 01:43:18.272
# As you hold my hand #

01:43:18.307 --> 01:43:23.126
# I could understand #

01:43:23.278 --> 01:43:27.861
# All the things that I've been denied #

01:43:33.554 --> 01:43:38.554
# All the things the things
that light has deprived #

01:43:58.026 --> 01:44:03.026
# Inside out inside of you #

01:44:03.514 --> 01:44:08.317
# Inside out and upside down #

01:44:08.352 --> 01:44:13.120
# Inside out upside of you #

01:44:13.183 --> 01:44:18.183
# Inside out and upside down #

01:44:22.974 --> 01:44:27.868
# As you hold my hand #

01:44:27.903 --> 01:44:32.762

# Outside of you #

01:45:11.344 --> 01:45:18.952
# Outside of you #
