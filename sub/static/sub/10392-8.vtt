WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:07.740
After nine days of threats
of and what was the most

00:07.741 --> 00:09.842
chaotic, difficult, yet amazing

00:09.843 --> 00:11.744
trip of my life, the last thing

00:11.745 --> 00:12.713
that stands between us and our

00:12.714 --> 00:17.584
flight home is the
reason we came.

00:17.585 --> 00:25.585
The Congo river itself.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.161
It has to be paid tomorrow.

00:28.162 --> 00:31.131
The U.N. Truck said he's been
here since this morning.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.200
What's up, Fred, ?

00:33.201 --> 00:35.034
They're starting the engine.

00:35.035 --> 00:35.336
Awesome.

00:35.336 --> 00:35.903
Just broke down again?

00:35.904 --> 00:37.970
Yeah.

00:37.971 --> 00:41.908
We now have one hour
of daylight left.

00:41.909 --> 00:45.845
They buried the engines
and then... okay great.

00:45.846 --> 00:53.753
Here it comes.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.021
You learn quickly.

00:55.022 --> 01:03.022
In Congo, things change
at a moment's notice.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.455
I wanted to see the Congo.

02:02.456 --> 02:10.455
For my sins, they let me.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.805
In "heart of darkness" Joseph

02:18.806 --> 02:21.341
Conrad writes of his alter

02:21.342 --> 02:23.243
ego... when I was a little chap,

02:23.244 --> 02:25.111
I had a passion for maps.

02:25.112 --> 02:30.650
At that time there were
many blank spaces on earth.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.752
But there was one yet, the

02:32.753 --> 02:37.857
biggest, the most blank, that
I had a hankering after.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.027
This then is the Congo.

02:41.028 --> 02:44.531
The size of all western
Europe combined.

02:44.532 --> 02:48.668
It should be Africa's
wealthiest nation.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.803
The people forget, or never even

02:50.804 --> 02:53.573
knew, that the 20th century's

02:53.574 --> 02:56.042
first holocaust happened here

02:56.043 --> 03:01.448
when Belgium's king Leopold
managed to bamboozle giving

03:01.449 --> 03:09.389
him personal title to the Congo.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.057
Leopold's agents of whom the

03:11.058 --> 03:14.160
mythical Kurtz was one, raided,

03:14.161 --> 03:15.362
slaughtered, mutilated and

03:15.363 --> 03:20.333
pressed into forced labor
much of the population, in a

03:20.334 --> 03:25.071
bloodthirsty quest for first
ivory and then rubber.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.440
When independence finally came,

03:27.441 --> 03:30.109
the Belgians trashed what
they could, and left behind a

03:30.110 --> 03:32.412
completely unprepared tribally

03:32.413 --> 03:34.714
divided and largely ungovernable

03:34.715 --> 03:37.717
land mass, filled with stuff

03:37.718 --> 03:41.020
that everybody in
the world wanted.

03:41.021 --> 03:49.021
And things pretty much
went downhill from there.

03:59.507 --> 04:07.507
♪

04:19.827 --> 04:22.429
But this story begins
with the truck stop.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.798
In Rwanda.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.900
Stocking up in Rwanda.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.971
My expectations for food in the

04:31.972 --> 04:39.972
Congo are more measured.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.583
If you're looking to get to the

04:43.584 --> 04:45.117
eastern Congo action and many

04:45.118 --> 04:46.986
would ask why you would even

04:46.987 --> 04:50.089
want to do that, the best way is

04:50.090 --> 04:52.559
to drive across from
neighboring Rwanda.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.461
This country, of course, not too

04:54.462 --> 04:58.665
long ago, suffered its
own appalling genocide.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.467
Behind the wheel, Dan.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.168
He's been living in the DRC for

05:02.169 --> 05:05.372
two years, working on a
documentary about some of the

05:05.373 --> 05:09.909
several dozen rebel
groups in the country.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.380
Riding shotgun, Dan's close

05:13.381 --> 05:19.386
friend and associate
Horeb, a Congolese.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.354
They're taking me
across the border.

05:21.355 --> 05:25.024
One side, Rwanda, hotels, paved

05:25.025 --> 05:32.799
roads, Internet, and
paperwork to be filled out.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.201
Just a few feet of barbed wire,

05:35.202 --> 05:43.202
machine guns and cement
walls away... this.

05:46.246 --> 05:54.246
Welcome to Goma.

05:55.088 --> 05:59.459
A city of 1 million, the
significant number of whom are

05:59.460 --> 06:06.265
IDPs, internally displaced
people... sitting, rather

06:06.266 --> 06:12.238
inconveniently, at the base of mt.
Niragango.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.841
Current street level is about 12

06:14.842 --> 06:17.109
feet off 20202, when
it last erupted.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.512
Lava everywhere.

06:19.513 --> 06:25.017
Which explains the
less than smooth ride.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.419
One of the first things you

06:26.420 --> 06:33.793
notice out the car
window, the U.n.

06:33.794 --> 06:37.063
About four months ago, the m-23,

06:37.064 --> 06:38.364
one of the various rebel groups

06:38.365 --> 06:42.401
holed up in the jungle
nearby, invaded the city.

06:42.402 --> 06:47.674
The NGOs battened
down the hatches.

06:47.675 --> 06:52.411
The U.N. Stood by, hands tied.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.580
Everyone else had to fend for

06:53.581 --> 06:55.247
themselves until
the rebels drew.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.416
The Congo was a place I dreamed

06:57.417 --> 06:59.351
of visiting before I ever

06:59.352 --> 07:04.991
thought I would get the
chance to travel the world.

07:04.992 --> 07:12.992
The action big here,
I'm not so sure.

07:15.469 --> 07:19.238
Dan, Horeb and I head
for a local restaurant.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.007
Good food is going to be a

07:21.008 --> 07:22.775
challenge soon, so we take the

07:22.776 --> 07:26.178
opportunity to fill
up on what we can.

07:26.179 --> 07:32.218
Grilled chicken, gugali,

07:32.219 --> 07:34.320
pirripirri pepper,
pretty nice meal.

07:34.321 --> 07:40.927
Goma in the '50s, tourists
used to come as far as rho

07:40.928 --> 07:42.595
Rhodesia, up here to vacation.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.263
Amazing life.

07:44.264 --> 07:48.334
I remember in my childhood
lions alongside the road.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.369
Goma was a choice
place for some time.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.905
They're not coming anymore?

07:52.906 --> 07:56.042
No.

07:56.043 --> 07:56.877
It's a red zone.

07:56.878 --> 07:58.945
It's looking like there won't

07:58.946 --> 08:02.481
be house to house fighting or

08:02.482 --> 08:04.584
artillery or more
tars dropping in.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.686
Was today a good day?

08:06.687 --> 08:09.155
We have a rebel group just

08:09.156 --> 08:12.258
ten kilometers north of us, and

08:12.259 --> 08:12.893
maybe several groups that are

08:12.894 --> 08:15.562
all caught in the
blender, you know.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.730
Things change quickly
in the Congo.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.165
Confused yet?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.533
Virtually all of the eastern

08:20.534 --> 08:22.268
part of the country is being

08:22.269 --> 08:23.435
contested by rebel groups...

08:23.436 --> 08:25.037
Some local and others allegedly

08:25.038 --> 08:26.438
acting on behalf of interests

08:26.439 --> 08:28.374
based in neighboring countries.

08:28.375 --> 08:34.914
Recently the largely Tutsi
Rwandan backed m-23 has been

08:34.914 --> 08:40.886
backed, but the mostly
Hewittu is also here.

08:40.888 --> 08:44.490
They can also refer to
self-defense groups or

08:44.491 --> 08:47.760
specifically entities.

08:47.761 --> 08:51.698
Which groups lie the frpi are

08:51.699 --> 08:53.165
defending a stake like gold, and

08:53.166 --> 08:54.433
the others are mainly interested

08:54.434 --> 08:56.502
in fighting with the particular

08:56.503 --> 09:00.673
enemy, in their case they
have a beef with the fdlr.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.576
Lots of other organizations
controlling territory who

09:03.577 --> 09:08.347
haven't come up with a
name or cool acronim yet.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.182
This is only a fraction that a

09:10.183 --> 09:11.818
single area of the Congo.

09:11.819 --> 09:15.354
Be advised this map was
hopelessly outdated before we

09:15.355 --> 09:17.624
even got here.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.458
It's all these variables kind

09:19.459 --> 09:21.427
of knotted into one big mess.

09:21.428 --> 09:24.530
These are the reasons why media

09:24.531 --> 09:26.766
has a difficult time, why the

09:26.767 --> 09:27.635
western world doesn't hear much

09:27.636 --> 09:29.301
about Congo, because how can you

09:29.302 --> 09:32.672
sum it up in a
three-minute report?

09:32.673 --> 09:35.274
About you for us Goma is just

09:35.275 --> 09:38.711
a stopover on the way
to the Congo river.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.513
So we need to keep moving.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.750
And roads, forget it.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.252
Certainly nothing even remotely

09:46.253 --> 09:48.587
safe between Goma and
where we are headed.

09:48.588 --> 09:55.795
We're flying so Kisangani,
this is the prefer route.

09:55.796 --> 10:00.499
We chartered the queen's
former 2r568ing wardrobe.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.568
When she traveled in her younger

10:02.569 --> 10:06.739
years, we're told her clothes
traveled in this beast.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.574
This is a first for me.

10:07.575 --> 10:12.144
You learn to take nothing
for granted in the Congo.

10:12.145 --> 10:12.646
Uh-oh.

10:12.647 --> 10:19.686
Just as we're about to take
off thunder, lightning.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.153
It looks fine to me.

10:21.154 --> 10:28.127
Let's get this thing airborne.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.129
Wow, nice.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.032
Has to wait this
one out a little.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.400
Crashes are pretty commonplace.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.268
Not so long ago a plane with

10:36.269 --> 10:38.270
nearly 100 people on board went

10:38.271 --> 10:41.407
down on the same route
we're taking today.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.275
Most planes crash in Congo

10:43.276 --> 10:44.476
crash because of the
weather, right?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.113
Yeah, most of the time, yeah.

10:47.114 --> 10:47.881
Not us.

10:47.881 --> 10:48.315
Don't worry.

10:48.316 --> 10:50.582
Impossible.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.219
The weather clears up, sort of.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.322
So we decide to give it a go.

10:56.323 --> 11:01.193
When the weather is very
bad, stay on the ground.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.862
What about rebels?

11:02.863 --> 11:03.930
Are they shooting at the planes?

11:03.931 --> 11:08.501
Normally, no.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.002
Okay.

11:09.003 --> 11:10.036
We'll see you after your trip.

11:10.037 --> 11:10.537
Yeah, yeah.

11:10.538 --> 11:18.538
Have a good one.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.986
Lifting off from Goma, we

11:26.987 --> 11:29.856
head out over the shores of lake

11:29.857 --> 11:34.693
Kivu before circling
back north-northeast.

11:34.694 --> 11:40.199
Our destination... what Conrad
referred to in "heart of

11:40.200 --> 11:41.934
darkness" as the inner station.

11:41.935 --> 11:46.305
Here surrounded by dense jungle

11:46.306 --> 11:48.875
lies our ren day view with the

11:48.876 --> 11:52.945
Congo river, response both
building this country and

11:52.946 --> 11:53.946
helping to destroy it.

12:07.861 --> 12:15.861
Two hours off Goma,
we land at Kisangani.

12:25.212 --> 12:28.414
It was once Stanleyville, the

12:28.415 --> 12:29.715
second largest city in the

12:29.716 --> 12:33.719
country, before war cut it off.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.788
Stanleyville, known in "hard of

12:35.789 --> 12:43.789
darkness" as the inner station.

12:44.531 --> 12:48.767
The Congo river stretches
across the country's middle.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.069
Conrad describes it as a

12:50.070 --> 12:51.971
twisting snake with its head in

12:51.972 --> 12:54.173
the Atlantic ocean and its tail

12:54.174 --> 12:58.277
buried deep in Africa's heart.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.612
To Europeans, it was a natural

13:00.613 --> 13:05.017
route to transport slaves,
ivory, rubber, minerals.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.486
The commodities upon which

13:07.487 --> 13:11.357
modern-day Brussels and
Antwerp are built.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.625
For the Congolese, both before

13:13.626 --> 13:19.498
and after the Belgians, it
provided more basic things.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.100
Water to watch, to clean your

13:21.101 --> 13:25.905
clothes in, to cook
with, to drink.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.474
Also fishing.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.211
Since long before the expeditions of Dr.
Livingston

13:32.212 --> 13:38.150
and Henry Morton Stanley, the

13:38.151 --> 13:39.151
Wageni tribe has been fishing

13:39.152 --> 13:45.858
the river in unique fashion.

13:45.859 --> 13:52.965
Highly coordinated and
acrobatic, the Wageni dived into

13:52.966 --> 13:58.637
the treachery rapids in what
is still referred to as

13:58.638 --> 13:59.472
Stanleyville falls.

13:59.473 --> 14:01.173
Perched on a precarious network

14:01.174 --> 14:07.446
of wooden poles,
they hoist together.

14:07.447 --> 14:15.447
The catch these
days... not much.

14:15.889 --> 14:22.794
So it is the second biggest
force in the Congo river.

14:22.795 --> 14:28.134
He was a guide bringing
tourists to his village.

14:28.135 --> 14:32.138
Since the last two wars,
Kisangani tourism has been

14:32.139 --> 14:36.408
pretty much nonexistent.

14:36.409 --> 14:40.379
Chief of the Wageni, Pierre mu

14:40.380 --> 14:46.152
sala, is said to be a direct
descendant of the king who

14:46.153 --> 14:49.255
greeted Stanley in the '70s.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.296
Thank him for the privilege
of seeing his community.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.630
It's a present from the chief.

14:58.631 --> 15:05.804
This is a way to welcome
the delegation of CNN.

15:05.805 --> 15:09.976
The Wageni tribe made, what

15:09.977 --> 15:12.478
was in retrospect, the mistake

15:12.479 --> 15:14.213
of allowing Stanley to pass.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.148
The famous explorer, of course,

15:16.149 --> 15:17.649
pretty much shot and raided his

15:17.650 --> 15:19.885
way along the historic route to

15:19.886 --> 15:21.988
the coast, before effectively

15:21.989 --> 15:29.989

colonial period.

personal property.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.542
Under Leopold's reign, men women

15:43.543 --> 15:45.677
and children were tagged with

15:45.678 --> 15:48.580
numbers, separated into groups,

15:48.581 --> 15:49.581
given production quotas.

15:49.582 --> 15:53.785
If they fell short, they were

15:53.786 --> 15:56.288
whipped, their hands
cut off, hanged.

15:56.289 --> 16:00.659
An estimated 10 million
Congolese were either starved,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.661
worked to death, executed or

16:02.662 --> 16:04.163
just killed where they stood,

16:04.164 --> 16:07.033
all in just over 20 years.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.268
By the end, half the population

31:07.900 --> 31:13.271
Where did you get yours?

31:13.272 --> 31:15.673
We've come a long way downriver,

31:15.674 --> 31:19.510
with many kilometers
still to go.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.779
Attention has turned
toward the evening meal.

31:21.780 --> 31:29.780
Sill figure I'll
make coq Au vin.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.356
Getting close to killing time.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.590
The moment of truth.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.025
It's quickly getting dark.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.561
I'm very aware of a
number of things.

31:36.562 --> 31:40.431
How do they usually
kill chickens?

31:40.432 --> 31:41.133
Small knife.

31:41.134 --> 31:46.871
Our chickens are
thin, cragly, tough.

31:46.872 --> 31:50.041
He's biting me.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.676
I'm probably going to have to

31:51.677 --> 31:54.980
stew the crap out of them.

31:54.981 --> 31:59.484
Still wet to kill these things.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.819
You want to eat, you have to

32:01.820 --> 32:06.291
kill your own chicken
and pluck it, too.

32:06.292 --> 32:11.762
But every man has
a breaking point.

32:11.763 --> 32:15.400
In retrospect, perhaps
this was ours.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.335
Harder, harder.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.469
Almost through, man.

32:18.470 --> 32:22.207
No, I'm not.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.508
Clean kill.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.244
Now you can join our treehouse.

32:26.245 --> 32:28.379
By the time our birds are

32:28.380 --> 32:30.548
cleaned and plucked, the sun is

32:30.549 --> 32:36.687
down and dinner is
still a long way off.

32:36.688 --> 32:41.327
♪ Clean out the chickens
♪ it's time to...

32:47.966 --> 32:55.506
Somewhere down the Congo
river, I'm continuing to deal

32:55.507 --> 32:56.442
with a few pressing concerns.

32:56.443 --> 32:58.643
The one knife on board is as

32:58.644 --> 33:01.746
sharp, really, as a soupspoon.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.548
Soon I'm frantically trying to

33:03.549 --> 33:08.353
rip out the backbone and
guts, with one hand.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.888
The damn generator
keeps kicking off.

33:10.889 --> 33:15.160
I really need light so I
can see what I'm cutting.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.662
I can't cut what I can't see.

33:17.663 --> 33:18.796
There's only 240 watts.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.831
No way it's the draw.

33:20.832 --> 33:28.832
They're not going to eat at all.

33:29.408 --> 33:34.245
I'm never going to get
through with this.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.547
Machete?

33:36.548 --> 33:39.784
No, maybe we should figure
out how to could be dinner,

33:39.785 --> 33:42.620
because we really won't
eat any dinner here.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.423
I've had a peanut butter and

33:45.424 --> 33:47.725
jelly sandwich, and I would like

33:47.726 --> 33:51.262
to eat, especially after getting

33:51.263 --> 33:55.766
through all this misery
with the chicken.

33:55.767 --> 33:56.034
All right.

33:56.035 --> 33:58.569
This machete... it would be

33:58.570 --> 34:00.571
apropos to point out we do not

34:00.572 --> 34:02.673
want to be moving at night.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.209
We would not like to run aground

34:04.210 --> 34:07.278
in the middle of the
freaking Congo.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.478
Swimming now.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.482
Is he worried about crocs?

34:11.483 --> 34:16.587
The current's unpredictable.

34:16.588 --> 34:17.489
Visibility nil.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.324
Time to tie up for the night.

34:20.326 --> 34:23.228
Generator issues more or less

34:23.228 --> 34:26.063
fixed, but now another just as

34:26.063 --> 34:28.498
serious problem presents itself.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.936
With the lights burning,
it becomes insanely buggy.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.304
Crush one of these moths, and

34:34.306 --> 34:37.175
you will blow up like a balloon.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.009
Seriously.

34:39.010 --> 34:44.014
Pour all three bottles
of wine into the onions.

34:44.014 --> 34:44.716
All right.

34:44.717 --> 34:51.322
Let's put the top on,
bring it up to a boil.

34:51.322 --> 34:52.989
Three hours later, it looks like

34:52.991 --> 34:55.693
the jungle-style stew might

34:55.694 --> 35:03.634
actually work out after all.

35:03.635 --> 35:03.902
Okay.

35:03.903 --> 35:05.370
So who wants to bring this over,

35:05.371 --> 35:08.806
carefully, to the table?

35:08.807 --> 35:09.074
All right.

35:09.075 --> 35:14.879
Let's eat.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.315
Bon apetit.

35:17.316 --> 35:24.455
Bon apetit.

35:24.456 --> 35:32.456
In the end, my coq awe vin
was scrappy, but tolerable.

35:36.034 --> 35:44.034
I think I now understand
what that means.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.823
Next morning on the river, and

35:58.824 --> 36:02.059
of course we're not alone.

36:02.060 --> 36:05.363
Fishermen from all the
surrounding villages have heard

36:05.364 --> 36:08.098
of us, and have, long before

36:08.099 --> 36:12.770
we're even awake, have
come by to check us out.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.706
Can you find a couple onions?

36:15.707 --> 36:16.907
Don't go crazy.

36:16.908 --> 36:20.077
If we don't have them,
we don't have them.

36:20.078 --> 36:22.146
I will not go crazy.

36:22.147 --> 36:22.848
All right.

36:22.849 --> 36:27.885
I about get on the
spam and egg patrol.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.421
They may have had invented the

36:30.422 --> 36:31.323
stealth bomber, maybe this will

36:31.324 --> 36:38.162
be our crowning
accomplishment as

36:38.163 --> 36:39.864
once we timely get there,

36:39.865 --> 36:41.799
we're supposed to get
all the way back.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.669
Coming back was never
part of the plan, man.

36:44.670 --> 36:45.970
We're not coming back.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.338
They will find us ten years

36:47.339 --> 36:48.806
later naked in the bush with

36:48.807 --> 36:51.309
like a necklace of spam cans.

36:51.310 --> 36:55.746
That was glorious.

36:55.747 --> 36:55.914
♪

36:55.915 --> 36:59.650
Time to get back
out on the river.

36:59.651 --> 37:04.422
We have places to go.

37:04.423 --> 37:08.092
Two days down the Congo.

37:08.093 --> 37:13.298
We're finally nearing
our destination.

37:13.299 --> 37:16.934
It's an abandoned Belgian
research station.

37:16.935 --> 37:20.605
It's still functioning in some

37:20.606 --> 37:24.909
capacity, but it goes about
30 kilometers in, over 250

37:24.910 --> 37:25.176
buildings.

37:25.177 --> 37:28.679
They are doing it all here.

37:28.680 --> 37:34.319
Much myth and legend
surrounds this place.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.486
Oh, there we go.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.121
Yeah.

37:36.122 --> 37:38.155
It has been inferred by some

37:38.156 --> 37:40.658
that the Belgians conducted

37:40.659 --> 37:43.828
uranium enrichment and a host of

37:43.829 --> 37:48.833
bizarre experiments here.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.101
However, the facts would suggest

37:51.102 --> 37:53.704
the scariest thing to ever

37:53.705 --> 37:57.675
happen here, some genetically

37:57.676 --> 37:58.544
modified banana varieties.

37:58.545 --> 38:03.281
We're in Gambi.

38:16.261 --> 38:18.062
Deep in the jungle and miles

38:18.063 --> 38:20.498
from anywhere, this was once the

38:20.499 --> 38:25.470
institute for agricultural
studies of Congo.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.805
Construction began in the 1930s.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.307
The complex was once staffed by

38:30.308 --> 38:33.644
hundreds of Belgian researchers,

38:33.645 --> 38:35.980
doctors and engineers until they

38:35.981 --> 38:43.421
left hurriedly in 1960.

38:43.422 --> 38:46.524
With independence began
a rapid decline.

38:46.525 --> 38:50.628
The eventual cessation
of funding.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.530
Of the hundreds of structures

38:52.531 --> 38:55.099
built here, what used to be

38:55.100 --> 38:56.867
housing, laboratories, hospitals

38:56.868 --> 39:00.471
and research facilities, the
vast complex's library is

39:00.472 --> 39:07.412
clearly the most important
to those who remain.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.013
Though crumbling like everything

39:09.014 --> 39:14.118
else, the grass is cut
and grounds maintained.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.821
It swept and kept clean, and yet

39:16.822 --> 39:21.526
most incredibly this man still

39:21.527 --> 39:24.028
fights a daily battle to stave

39:24.029 --> 39:27.264
off further decay to the
thousands of volumes of books

39:27.265 --> 39:30.334
and research materials
contained on these shelves.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.769
So what happened here?

39:31.770 --> 39:32.903
Did the place stay open?

39:32.904 --> 39:38.275
Did people continue
to do research?

39:38.276 --> 39:41.111
There's some new stuff, but

39:41.112 --> 39:42.780
for those who have been there

39:42.781 --> 39:48.853
for long, they get an allowance
from the government.

39:48.854 --> 39:49.721
Independence comes.

39:49.722 --> 39:56.495
What happens here?

40:03.134 --> 40:07.505
So unless I'm mistaken, the

40:07.506 --> 40:08.673
gentleman just said cutting-edge

40:08.674 --> 40:12.142
research moved to
Burundi and elsewhere.

40:12.143 --> 40:16.013
The Congolese who remain, their

40:16.014 --> 40:17.848
mission all these years later is

40:17.849 --> 40:22.119
preserve the patrimony
that existed.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.353
All this was state of the art

40:23.354 --> 40:27.024
back in the '50s when
the library was built.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.193
But for 20 years there hasn't

40:29.194 --> 40:31.161
been electricity to run the

40:31.162 --> 40:34.064
dehumid fires to
keep out the damp.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.500
Through so many wars, through

40:35.501 --> 40:36.634
all of these difficulties, he

40:36.635 --> 40:40.505
has maintained this facility to

40:40.506 --> 40:45.242
an extraordinary degree.

40:45.243 --> 40:47.012
Why?

41:02.894 --> 41:08.432
Staff still show
up to work and organize.

41:08.433 --> 41:11.435
Catalog and write
requests for funding.

41:11.436 --> 41:13.804
Perhaps to Kinshasa or a central

41:13.805 --> 41:19.510
office where someone may
or may not ever respond.

41:19.511 --> 41:22.279
He was here
pre-independence, yes?

41:22.280 --> 41:25.450
Does he remember
the Belgian rule?

41:32.323 --> 41:37.294
He remembers the period, and

41:37.295 --> 41:39.897
that was the best time
they were living.

41:39.898 --> 41:43.500
What do you say to someone
who suggests that ball Jan

41:43.501 --> 41:51.501
colonialism might have
been the good times?

42:00.351 --> 42:01.686
The road home.

42:01.687 --> 42:05.723
Such as it is.

42:05.724 --> 42:11.962
Rotting Bridges, makeshift
ferries, it's an adventure.

42:11.963 --> 42:16.500
Fortunately ours was
a good adventure.

42:16.501 --> 42:20.537
The Congo is a place that's
always fascinated me.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.906
This is a trip I've been wanting

42:21.907 --> 42:23.407
to take since I've been writing

42:23.408 --> 42:26.043
stories or making television,

42:26.044 --> 42:28.412
but what I found was
something unexpected.

42:28.413 --> 42:30.781
I met a lot of people who for a

42:30.782 --> 42:33.651
long time have been waiting.

42:33.652 --> 42:38.255
Hoping for things to get better.

42:38.256 --> 42:45.195
A lot more hope here than
there's any right to expect.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.196
When all is said and done, I

42:46.197 --> 42:49.167
wanted to go to the
Congo and I did.
