00:10.663 --> 00:12.869
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

00:13.340 --> 00:15.655
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

00:15.889 --> 00:17.015
Freeze !
Put your hands up !

00:17.057 --> 00:19.930
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

00:20.035 --> 00:21.794
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

00:21.986 --> 00:23.608
Who the hell are you people ?

00:24.219 --> 00:26.480
<i>My girlfriend Rita
will be in danger.</i>

00:26.576 --> 00:29.584
<i>I know all this because
I am living the same day...</i>

00:29.904 --> 00:31.301
<i>over and over again.</i>

00:31.404 --> 00:33.901
<i>The day is the same, but
different things happen.</i>

00:34.009 --> 00:36.748
<i>Every decision I make
has a consequence.</i>

00:37.375 --> 00:40.259
<i>I could save a stranger's life...
or not.</i>

00:40.349 --> 00:42.878
I didn't go for coffee.
<i>I could try to run...</i>

00:43.606 --> 00:44.624
<i>or hide.</i>

00:46.201 --> 00:49.268
<i>But the next morning, I feel
the pain of the day before.</i>

00:50.318 --> 00:52.142
<i>Every day I get another chance.</i>

00:52.282 --> 00:53.226
This mess you're in...

00:53.241 --> 00:55.905
have anything to do with the fact you
been looking into the latin disciples ?

00:55.907 --> 00:58.264
We flipped this kid Damien Ortiz
against the disciples,

00:58.374 --> 00:59.451
now he's on the run.

00:59.887 --> 01:01.640
<i>Every day,
I get another clue.</i>

01:01.863 --> 01:04.495
<i>Hopper, you should have received
a package today. It's important.</i>

01:04.596 --> 01:07.679
<i>Today, I have to get
that package.</i>

01:48.366 --> 01:50.052
- Good morning.
- Morning.

02:14.348 --> 02:16.769
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:25.177 --> 02:26.532
What are you doing ?

02:27.208 --> 02:28.775
- Just a sec.
- Brett.

02:28.964 --> 02:30.387
I'm just gonna take a shower.

02:30.488 --> 02:32.065
Me, too.
I'll scrub your back.

02:32.828 --> 02:34.328
Sounds great, baby.

02:35.178 --> 02:39.010
Will you just let me in ? Come on.
Come on. Come on. Open up.

02:39.714 --> 02:40.715
What ?

02:42.379 --> 02:44.590
I thought we were gonna
take a shower together.

02:44.834 --> 02:48.640
I was... we were, but I was thinking
maybe I would take the day off today.

02:49.719 --> 02:51.583
Really ?
You never take the day off.

02:51.684 --> 02:53.905
Yeah, well, I thought
maybe we could hang out.

02:55.627 --> 02:58.323
- Baby, I gotta work.
- Well, you could take the day off, too.

02:58.559 --> 02:59.715
I can't do that.

02:59.885 --> 03:01.384
Come on, come on.
It'll be fun.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.493
Come...

03:06.211 --> 03:07.561
Oh, no.

03:12.314 --> 03:13.476
I'm sorry.

03:13.826 --> 03:15.979
- It's okay.
- No. It's not okay.

03:16.580 --> 03:19.088
I know that your mother
gave this to you.

03:19.801 --> 03:22.118
Okay. I'm gonna make
this up to you. I promise.

03:22.219 --> 03:24.687
We can go anywhere
you want to go today. Anywere.

03:26.956 --> 03:27.967
Okay.

03:28.883 --> 03:29.887
Okay ?

03:30.842 --> 03:33.820
Okay. Okay, cool.
I'm just gonna drop by my place

03:33.920 --> 03:36.907
and pick up a package,
and we'll be good. Cool. Let's go.

03:47.019 --> 03:50.277
- You said anywhere, right ?
- Huh ? Oh, yep. Yep.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.596
Okay. Mexico.

03:53.178 --> 03:54.447
Mex... what ?

03:54.588 --> 03:55.848
Let's go down to Rosarito Beach.

03:55.958 --> 03:58.340
I know this great lobster shack
right off the highway.

03:58.444 --> 04:00.087
Six beers for a buck.

04:02.288 --> 04:04.718
Okay. Sure. Sounds great.

04:12.110 --> 04:14.080
Miss... you dropped this.

04:24.566 --> 04:25.914
You want some coffee ?

04:26.936 --> 04:27.936
Yeah.

04:29.304 --> 04:31.074
This will be the most
incredible by far...

04:31.176 --> 04:32.424
Excuse me, ma'am.

04:32.728 --> 04:33.835
L.A.P.D.

04:34.014 --> 04:36.599
- Hold on. What's the problem ?
- Can I see some I.D., please ?

04:36.697 --> 04:38.805
- What for ?
- Just a police investigation.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.962
We're questioning
potential witnesses.

04:41.140 --> 04:43.675
I didn't see anything.
And I have a morning meeting that's...

04:43.778 --> 04:46.956
I'm sure he'll understand.
Can I please see your identification ?

04:52.849 --> 04:53.879
Hello ?

04:55.102 --> 04:56.939
Wait. Just calm down.
What's wrong ?

04:58.642 --> 05:00.965
Look, I can't.
Not today. Not now.

05:03.646 --> 05:07.162
Just... please just stop calling me.
I just... I can't. I'm sorry.

05:07.964 --> 05:09.216
I just... I can't.

05:12.557 --> 05:15.076
Okay. And this judge Nitzberg...

05:15.434 --> 05:16.561
he's your supervisor.

05:16.661 --> 05:18.853
Look, I've given you
my address, my cell phone.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.580
I mean, what more do you want ?

05:22.329 --> 05:23.829
Thank you.
That'll be all, ma'am.

05:23.942 --> 05:25.699
My car !
My car !

05:28.267 --> 05:31.052
- Where you going ?
- In the bus. I'm gonna go help'em.

05:31.182 --> 05:32.412
- Rita...
- Call 9-1-1, okay ?

05:32.467 --> 05:33.987
W ait.
We had plans.

05:34.136 --> 05:36.519
I'm sorry. We're just gonna
have to play hooky another day.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.733
Okay, but wait.
We don't have to cancel.

05:38.804 --> 05:40.758
The E. M. T. S are gonna come.
They'll take over.

05:40.809 --> 05:41.987
Brett, what is going on ?

05:42.085 --> 05:43.357
- Nothing.
- Nothing ?

05:43.391 --> 05:46.388
Nothing ? First you take the day off,
then you don't want me to go to work.

05:46.393 --> 05:48.755
Now you want me to leave
a major accident scene ?

05:49.012 --> 05:50.730
You are acting really strange.

05:50.843 --> 05:52.248
What has gotten into you ?

05:52.474 --> 05:53.809
They played me
some voice mail.

05:53.815 --> 05:55.747
A woman talking about some
package they sent to you.

05:55.751 --> 05:57.837
They think it has something
to do with Garza.

05:58.353 --> 06:01.549
I'm gonna go help those people,
and then I'm going to the hospital.

06:02.553 --> 06:04.339
Okay, but stay there.
Don't leave.

06:04.613 --> 06:07.803
Okay ? I'm gonna meet you
after I go to my place.

06:07.904 --> 06:09.588
Don't leave the hospital !

06:41.642 --> 06:43.201
- Mr. Hopper.
- Mr. Zeitoun.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.119
- I need to speak to you.
- I know, I know.

06:45.219 --> 06:48.072
The dog's been barking. There's a
leak upstairs. A plumber came, right ?

06:48.306 --> 06:49.857
Yes. That's... yes.

06:49.985 --> 06:51.400
Sorry for the inconvenience.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.228
What is this, a joke ?

07:20.050 --> 07:21.591
You think this is funny ?

07:23.198 --> 07:25.561
- Is he talking to us ?
- Nah. No way he made us.

07:25.664 --> 07:26.980
Is this what you want ?

07:27.226 --> 07:29.168
Huh ? Come and get it !

07:29.306 --> 07:31.536
- No, he's definitely talking to us.
- Yup.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.980
Let's start two large-bore I. V. S,
normal saline, wide open.

07:46.079 --> 07:49.480
And I want you to page Dr. Kim.
I think she might have tension pneumo.

07:50.071 --> 07:51.994
Rita, you've got a visitor.

07:52.784 --> 07:53.700
Chad.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.782
- You changed your hair.
- Six months ago.

07:55.852 --> 07:58.179
It looks nice. Although I liked it
when you had that layered thing.

07:58.194 --> 08:00.175
Chad, I'm working.
What are you doing here ?

08:00.274 --> 08:02.004
Can't a guy stop by
check on his ex-wife ?

08:02.105 --> 08:03.136
No.

08:04.457 --> 08:06.733
Well, then I'll cut right to it.
You seen Hopper lately ?

08:06.777 --> 08:08.381
How's that
any of your business ?

08:08.724 --> 08:11.671
It became my business when your
boyfriend murdered Alberto Garza.

08:12.416 --> 08:13.590
What are you talking about ?

08:13.699 --> 08:15.260
Assistant D.A.
got hit last night.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.013
Hopper's the prime suspect.

08:17.260 --> 08:18.886
There's a warrant
out for his arrest.

08:19.302 --> 08:20.890
There must be some mistake.

08:20.969 --> 08:23.037
Yeah, kind of hard to believe.
You think you know someone,

08:23.040 --> 08:24.889
and  then they go
and do something crazy.

08:24.990 --> 08:26.584
Brett didn't kill anyone.

08:26.925 --> 08:28.265
I hear different.

08:29.226 --> 08:31.803
Sorry to be the one to tell you,
but Hopper's in real trouble.

08:31.904 --> 08:34.823
There are a couple guys downtown
wanna talk to you about it.

08:36.248 --> 08:37.779
Look, you don't have to go,

08:38.071 --> 08:39.515
but it might be helpful...

08:40.102 --> 08:42.111
for Hopper's sake.

08:44.140 --> 08:44.932
Hi, Hopper.

08:45.032 --> 08:48.203
I know this is a reach for you,
but don't do anything stupid.

08:48.398 --> 08:49.900
- Rita, we need to leave.
- Brett...

08:49.972 --> 08:52.307
Yeah, that's a good plan. She's gonna
go on the run with a fugitive.

08:52.313 --> 08:54.964
You gotta come with me, all right ?
It's the only way I can protect you.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.928
The only one she needs
protection from is you, buddy.

08:56.942 --> 08:59.395
Sweetheart, call 9-1-1. I got a guy
here with a gun in my back.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.193
Whatever he's saying,
I didn't do it. I didn't kill Garza.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.611
You gotta believe me.

09:03.701 --> 09:05.376
Brett, just put the gun down.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.966
Better listen to her, Hopper.
Hole's getting deeper.

09:07.975 --> 09:11.047
Shut up ! Honey, listen,
I know this looks crazy.

09:11.157 --> 09:13.473
I know I don't have the right
to ask you this, but I am.

09:13.575 --> 09:17.183
You gotta come with me. I'll explain
everything later. Just please

09:17.285 --> 09:18.441
come with me.

09:20.161 --> 09:21.165
Brett...

09:23.213 --> 09:26.671
That was real sweet, but you're under
arrest. I'm gonna have to take you in.

09:27.097 --> 09:28.357
Not today.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.770
+

09:52.742 --> 09:54.539
- Whiskey sour.
- You got it.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.698
A little early for that,
don't you think ?

09:58.545 --> 10:01.447
- Hopper, what are you doing here ?
- I'm here looking for you.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.055
- They say you killed...
- Garza. Yeah, I know.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.548
I also know that they offered
you a deal to flip on me

10:06.648 --> 10:09.407
in exchange for amnesty
on your I.A. investigation.

10:11.397 --> 10:12.867
I never agreed to...

10:15.461 --> 10:17.751
- How the hell did you know that ?
- Just hear me out, all right ?

10:17.755 --> 10:19.486
That's all I'm asking.

10:21.553 --> 10:22.901
<i>Message eight...</i>

10:23.000 --> 10:24.971
<i>Hopper, you should have
received a package today.</i>

10:25.053 --> 10:28.298
<i>It's important. Don't let anyone know
you have it. You'll be contacted...</i>

10:28.526 --> 10:29.528
No.

10:29.626 --> 10:31.187
Homicide already
played me that.

10:31.372 --> 10:32.883
Who, the hardy boys ?

10:33.024 --> 10:36.021
They're pretty hot and heavy on that
package. They think it's tied to Garza.

10:36.119 --> 10:37.765
Yeah, well, so do I.

10:40.129 --> 10:42.060
-  And this is what was inside ?
- Yeah.

10:42.449 --> 10:44.929
Why would someone send you
a busted up hourglass ?

10:45.546 --> 10:48.776
I don't know. But that's why I need
you to run a trace on my home phone.

10:48.877 --> 10:50.547
Incoming calls
for the last 12 hours.

10:50.648 --> 10:54.443
If I can find the woman who left that
message, maybe I can get some answers.

10:57.833 --> 11:00.360
How do you know I won't
just turn this into them,

11:01.227 --> 11:03.015
make all my problems go away ?

11:03.655 --> 11:04.695
Hopper !

11:09.302 --> 11:11.072
I don't know.
I just got a feeling.

11:18.174 --> 11:20.335
Shelton, heard you had Hopper
but you let him go.

11:20.535 --> 11:22.074
But you brought
his girlfriend in, right ?

11:22.078 --> 11:23.415
Yeah, where is she ?

11:23.545 --> 11:25.390
She's busy. She'll come in
on her own time.

11:25.492 --> 11:28.260
Busy ? I thought you said you
had an in with her. Guess not.

11:28.361 --> 11:30.627
- Give the guy a break. It's his wife.
- Ex-wife.

11:30.726 --> 11:32.018
Right, that's gotta suck.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.235
Keep laughing. You two
are heading into a wall.

11:34.335 --> 11:35.270
Yeah ? How's that ?

11:35.371 --> 11:37.352
You'll never get Andrea Battle
to flip on Hopper.

11:37.451 --> 11:42.674
Really ? Well, who do you think
she'd rather deal with, I.A. or us ?

11:53.302 --> 11:55.936
Message on your answering machine
came from a blocked number.

11:56.037 --> 11:57.845
- What kind of a block ?
- Law enforcement.

11:57.944 --> 12:00.004
- Did you bypass it ?
- Gimme some credit.

12:00.105 --> 12:03.176
The call came from the home
of a U.S. Attorney, Nathan Baxter.

12:03.279 --> 12:06.225
- What happened at the safe house ?
- Focus, Baxter.

12:06.597 --> 12:08.146
Is he a friend of yours ?

12:10.999 --> 12:12.432
What's going on, Hopper ?

12:13.271 --> 12:16.682
That U.S. Attorney's putting together
a case against the latin disciples.

12:16.782 --> 12:19.759
Yeah, I heard about the rumors.
What's that got to do with you ?

12:21.958 --> 12:25.061
Baxter contacted me about
an L.D. informant I'm running,

12:25.202 --> 12:28.219
Damien Ortiz. I got him to flip
against the disciples,

12:28.317 --> 12:30.135
had him all holed up
in a safe house, but

12:30.246 --> 12:31.966
something happened
and the whole thing went south.

12:31.974 --> 12:34.031
Turned me against my own only
so you could sell my ass out ?

12:34.033 --> 12:35.726
I didn't sell you out.

12:36.018 --> 12:38.354
And what, you thought you'd just
tell me about it at trial ?

12:38.464 --> 12:40.838
No. I know I shouldn't have
kept you in the dark.

12:40.970 --> 12:42.402
I know it was a mistake.

12:42.635 --> 12:44.511
Yeah, damn right,
it was a mistake.

12:47.683 --> 12:50.411
Anything else you're
not telling me, partner ?

12:52.561 --> 12:54.388
Yeah, but you wouldn't
believe me.

12:54.882 --> 12:56.758
You got an address on Baxter ?

13:37.301 --> 13:38.687
I got blood.

13:38.876 --> 13:40.291
Yeah, I do, too.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.090
+

14:04.208 --> 14:05.338
- You know her ?
- No.

14:05.436 --> 14:07.821
But I think she's the woman
who called me about the package.

14:07.949 --> 14:10.313
The killer shot her once in the back.
She was running away.

14:10.397 --> 14:13.269
Yeah, if I can get here earlier
tomorrow, I might be able to help her,

14:13.396 --> 14:16.787
- maybe get some information.
- What the hell are you talking about ?

14:21.136 --> 14:22.649
Something's happening today,

14:23.160 --> 14:25.304
something big,
and I'm at the center of it.

14:25.444 --> 14:28.985
I don't know how. I don't know why.
I don't know who's pulling the strings.

14:29.087 --> 14:31.383
But somehow
all of this is tied together.

14:31.812 --> 14:33.945
Damien, Baxter, Garza

14:34.371 --> 14:35.890
and now this dead woman.

14:36.845 --> 14:40.791
- You think this is a conspiracy ?
- Yes, and I'm the fall guy.

14:44.568 --> 14:46.375
Two years we've
been together, right ?

14:46.582 --> 14:49.962
Two years ? I've never even
had a boyfriend last that long.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.111
We  used to finish
each other's sentences.

14:52.173 --> 14:54.134
Now you're running
investigations behind my back,

14:54.205 --> 14:56.598
talking about some conspiracy
against you. I mean,

14:56.706 --> 14:58.975
- I wanna believe you...
- You don't believe me, do you ?

14:59.105 --> 15:00.213
You lied to me.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.636
I'll give you a half-hour
before I call this in.

15:17.988 --> 15:19.384
All right.

15:22.687 --> 15:23.852
Hey, hopper ?

15:27.475 --> 15:29.117
Who else you been lying to ?

15:32.392 --> 15:34.144
I already told you,
I'm not going to the station.

15:34.206 --> 15:36.514
And I'm not talking to anyone
about Brett, least of all you, Chad.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.003
Yeah, I got that loud and clear.
I'm not here on police business.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.428
- Then why are you here ?
- Well, it's must've been a rough day.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.383
I thought you might
need a ride home.

15:45.589 --> 15:46.814
You're kidding, right ?

15:47.673 --> 15:50.323
Yeah, forget it. Bad idea.

15:50.579 --> 15:53.611
I'll call you a cab.
Just wanted to make sure you're okay.

15:56.570 --> 15:57.956
Are you... okay ?

16:01.367 --> 16:02.800
Just let me take you home.

16:14.986 --> 16:16.352
Well, thank you.

16:16.683 --> 16:17.993
Yeah, no problem.

16:18.736 --> 16:20.179
Chad, don't.

16:20.481 --> 16:22.056
I'm not gonna try anything.

16:22.304 --> 16:24.243
I thought you might
want me to check your place.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.423
Why ?

16:26.147 --> 16:28.875
I'm worried about you, what,
with Hopper out there somewhere.

16:28.957 --> 16:30.870
No, I'm just saying,
he's armed and dangerous...

16:30.876 --> 16:33.555
- Brett would never hurt me.
- Not on purpose.

16:33.878 --> 16:35.677
Things can go sideways.
I mean, I've seen it.

16:35.778 --> 16:39.309
A couple years ago, cops were serving
a warrant on this cripple in Tarzana,

16:39.410 --> 16:41.209
- the guy pulls a gun...
- And they shot him.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.599
Turns out they had
the wrong address, right ?

16:44.138 --> 16:46.256
You forget,
I know all your stories.

16:46.634 --> 16:49.333
- Yeah, I guess you do.
- Yeah, I do.

16:50.372 --> 16:52.659
Well, look, if you want,
I can stay over.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.318
on the couch, of course.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.598
Thank you for the ride, Chad.

16:57.939 --> 16:59.497
Let's just leave it at that.

17:11.252 --> 17:12.233
Shelton.

17:13.612 --> 17:14.979
Oh, hey, Buck.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.922
Yeah, I think I can
still make that.

17:22.156 --> 17:23.772
Where'd  you say that bar was ?

17:23.911 --> 17:25.614
It's the place on Los Feliz.

17:27.277 --> 17:28.700
I'll see you there.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.685
- What happened to your shoulder ?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

17:56.786 --> 17:59.296
- You're bleeding. Let me see.
- Rita, I'm fine.

17:59.857 --> 18:02.391
I just came by to make sure
that you got here safely.

18:02.962 --> 18:04.283
Chad drove me home.

18:05.599 --> 18:06.662
Chad ?

18:07.106 --> 18:10.533
Yeah, he was worried that maybe you'd
gone off the deep end or something.

18:10.634 --> 18:13.594
Listen, I promise I will tell you
everything. I just...

18:14.058 --> 18:16.271
I don't have the time
right now, all right ?

18:17.859 --> 18:19.483
Then you're gonna make time.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.364
I have been worried sick,

18:21.586 --> 18:23.406
and Chad says you've been
accused of murder ?

18:23.408 --> 18:25.660
Since when do you start
believing everything Chad says ?

18:25.768 --> 18:27.318
When you put a gun on him.

18:27.418 --> 18:30.666
You came to the hospital, a place
where I work, and brought a gun.

18:30.765 --> 18:32.727
And now you don't
wanna talk about it ?

18:32.951 --> 18:34.904
You won't understand.

18:35.035 --> 18:36.985
God, I want to understand !

18:37.642 --> 18:39.785
But you are scaring me, Brett.

18:40.693 --> 18:44.061
I just want to know what happened to
the man I went to bed with last night.

18:44.404 --> 18:47.715
Look, I know that I should
not have come here tonight.

18:48.114 --> 18:51.324
And I'm sorry, but I just...
I wanted to make sure that you...

18:51.834 --> 18:53.396
you were all right.

18:55.854 --> 18:57.258
I'm not all right.

18:58.944 --> 19:00.904
Please... please just go.

19:06.615 --> 19:07.772
Please.

19:37.264 --> 19:39.044
Stop ! Stop ! Stop !

19:39.183 --> 19:42.651
If you think that first step's a bitch,
wait till the next one. Damien...

19:43.835 --> 19:45.021
Hell no.

19:52.669 --> 19:56.325
Fellas, look, I know I forgot
to call Damien. I know that.

19:56.427 --> 19:58.821
You know, I missed my 9 :00.
I realize that. I just...

19:58.920 --> 20:02.300
I've been, like...
like, crazy, crazy busy.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.151
You get that, right ?

20:07.065 --> 20:08.363
So we cool ?

20:19.481 --> 20:20.589
Damien...

20:21.122 --> 20:22.315
I can explain.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.206
- I can explain.
- Too bad.

20:24.631 --> 20:26.373
The time for explaining's over.

20:26.388 --> 20:28.686
I thought we had a deal.
I help you, you help me.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.228
- Win-win for everyone, right ?
- Yes,

20:30.243 --> 20:31.704
- and you did...
- I put myself out there for you !

20:31.719 --> 20:33.836
- You did the right thing !
- You think so ?

20:34.445 --> 20:37.691
You wanna know what happened to the last dude
in my hood who snitched on a rival banger ?

20:38.307 --> 20:41.037
Let me guess. He got taken
to an abandoned parking structure ?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.360
Nah, man,

20:43.170 --> 20:44.769
he got territory.

20:45.098 --> 20:47.549
Got rid of the competition,
scored 12 blocks all his own,

20:47.555 --> 20:50.428
upped his production by 150%.

20:50.813 --> 20:53.188
The dude was making
five figures a week.

20:53.999 --> 20:55.536
He got treated right.

20:56.012 --> 20:56.805
Me ?

20:56.818 --> 20:58.358
I let you talk me into
ratting out my boys,

20:58.372 --> 21:00.726
let you stick me in
some safe house, and then

21:00.867 --> 21:03.202
- I almost get my ass shot off.
- Damien, you gotta believe me

21:03.206 --> 21:05.024
I wanna believe you,
Hopper, I really do.

21:05.037 --> 21:07.006
Only I can't find you.
You don't return my calls.

21:07.022 --> 21:08.426
And when I reach out to you,
you blow me off.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.614
I'm sorry.
I've been a little busy.

21:10.886 --> 21:12.905
-  You've been busy ?
- Yes.

21:15.087 --> 21:17.201
The city's about to go up
in flames, Hop.

21:18.128 --> 21:19.838
There are deals being cut right
now that I'm not...

21:19.853 --> 21:21.634
What are you talking about, deals ?

21:23.056 --> 21:24.215
What deals ?

21:24.544 --> 21:27.100
You have no idea
how big this is, do you ?

21:27.276 --> 21:28.252
Well, tell me.

21:28.401 --> 21:29.930
You haven't earned that.

21:30.719 --> 21:33.054
See, on the street,
all you got is your word.

21:33.068 --> 21:35.049
There's no contracts,
no lawyers.

21:35.065 --> 21:37.726
You break your word,
there's a price to pay...

21:38.335 --> 21:39.288
simple.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.437
what's in the back ?

21:43.803 --> 21:44.689
That ?

21:51.424 --> 21:53.157
You remember Baxter, right ?

22:04.258 --> 22:07.485
You two chotas were the only ones
who knew about that safe house.

22:07.757 --> 22:09.481
So one of you is gonna die tonight.

22:09.493 --> 22:11.580
- You're making a big mistake.
- You made the mistake !

22:11.593 --> 22:13.432
Somebody gave you up
at the safe house,

22:13.436 --> 22:15.521
but it wasn't Baxter,
it wasn't me,

22:15.757 --> 22:16.634
all right ?

22:16.638 --> 22:18.113
We've been set up, man.

22:18.115 --> 22:19.216
- Set up ?
- Yes.

22:19.229 --> 22:21.671
- By who ?
- I don't know, but I'm a figure that out.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.789
I just need a little bit more time.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.185
Just a little bit more time, Damien.

22:26.776 --> 22:27.912
Can you do that ?

22:29.710 --> 22:31.626
I'm-a find out who's behind this.

22:32.329 --> 22:34.031
You got my word on that.

22:41.295 --> 22:42.520
You know what, Hop ?

22:43.645 --> 22:44.773
I believe you.

22:53.285 --> 22:54.306
We're done.

22:54.846 --> 22:56.443
I see you again,

22:56.631 --> 22:57.969
and you're dead, too.

23:14.010 --> 23:14.640
+

23:40.986 --> 23:42.840
Hey, you're up early.

23:44.467 --> 23:46.503
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.998
What's wrong ?
Are you mad at me ?

23:51.025 --> 23:52.305
Nice grab.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.492
Yeah, I was just I was just lucky.

23:56.848 --> 23:59.606
Look, I'm sorry. I just got a...
I got a lot going on right now.

23:59.735 --> 24:01.091
You want to talk about it ?

24:01.740 --> 24:02.423
No.

24:03.925 --> 24:04.591
No.

24:07.091 --> 24:09.676
Yeah, yeah, I do actually...

24:11.168 --> 24:13.108
I have this... this case, and

24:13.122 --> 24:14.497
there's a witness

24:14.502 --> 24:16.790
and the witness
has a... a hit out

24:16.805 --> 24:18.182
on her.

24:18.445 --> 24:20.127
And I need to protect her.

24:20.864 --> 24:23.744
But if I do, then I won't have time
for the case.

24:23.748 --> 24:25.288
- Don't you have help ?
- No,

24:25.301 --> 24:27.159
it's complicated.

24:27.183 --> 24:29.931
So if you don't protect her,
will she get hurt ?

24:32.967 --> 24:33.956
I don't know.

24:34.538 --> 24:35.914
Well, I think it's obvious.

24:36.896 --> 24:39.674
The only way to protect her
is to get to the bottom of it, right ?

24:39.745 --> 24:42.169
Solve the case
wouldn't that make her safe ?

24:43.995 --> 24:45.226
I hope so.

24:45.672 --> 24:46.981
Solve the case.

24:54.639 --> 24:56.331
What was that for ?

24:56.557 --> 24:58.527
Just for being you.

25:11.662 --> 25:12.452
Oh...

25:14.118 --> 25:15.695
if Chad calls,

25:16.066 --> 25:17.499
talk to him.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.174
Okay, and this judge Nitzberg...

25:45.719 --> 25:46.865
This is Margo.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.831
Hey, uh, where the hell are you ?

25:49.900 --> 25:51.543
<i>- Who's this ?</i>
- The meeting got pushed up.

25:51.548 --> 25:53.586
- You're late !
<i>- I didn't hear about this.</i>

25:53.592 --> 25:56.290
No, Nitzberg is looking for you.
He's really upset.

25:56.295 --> 25:58.057
<i>Oh, okay.
Give me 20 minutes.</i>

25:58.062 --> 26:00.857
You gotta get here right now.
And don't stop for coffee !

26:01.023 --> 26:02.265
Okay, I'll be right there.

26:02.281 --> 26:04.146
I said, don't stop for coffee !

26:21.960 --> 26:23.383
Yes, sir, will do.

26:25.875 --> 26:26.788
So ?

26:27.198 --> 26:28.274
So we wait.

26:29.499 --> 26:32.188
Was... was he pissed
about the guy in the tub ?

26:33.048 --> 26:34.280
What do you think ?

26:37.477 --> 26:40.072
You know what a one-bedroom
runs in this neighborhood ?

26:40.499 --> 26:42.145
I don't know, $1,200 ?

26:43.683 --> 26:45.366
That's ludicrous.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.436
- What, are you moving here ?
- No.

26:47.450 --> 26:48.846
So what do you care ?

26:49.380 --> 26:51.724
Morning, boys.
Ah, don't do that.

26:54.049 --> 26:55.992
- Can we help you with something ?
- You can start by putting your hands

26:55.996 --> 26:57.371
where I can see'em.

27:01.309 --> 27:02.389
Now...

27:02.537 --> 27:04.134
why are you following me ?

27:04.483 --> 27:06.839
- We're just sitting here.
- And videotaping me ?

27:06.874 --> 27:08.449
- We're tourists.
- Yeah,

27:08.466 --> 27:10.233
know any good places
to eat around here ?

27:11.918 --> 27:13.850
Now I know you've been following
my girlfriend

27:13.997 --> 27:16.410
and my sister.
I know about the guy in the quarry.

27:16.904 --> 27:18.798
I wanna speak to him, right now.

27:18.813 --> 27:21.149
All right, listen,
you got us, okay ?

27:21.824 --> 27:23.631
I'm just gonna reach for my phone.

27:30.447 --> 27:32.828
- Yeah, it's me again.
- Hey, who the hell are you ?

27:46.797 --> 27:48.614
- Move, I got a shot !
- Don't shoot !

27:48.628 --> 27:51.099
- I can get him. Just move.
- Don't shoot !

27:52.751 --> 27:54.044
I got him.

27:56.234 --> 27:58.376
Get out !
Come on, move away !

28:14.131 --> 28:15.198
Drive !

28:36.552 --> 28:38.256
The balls on that guy.

28:38.298 --> 28:39.579
Wanna go back ?

28:40.034 --> 28:41.823
No, we gotta call it in.

28:44.993 --> 28:46.299
Where's your phone ?

28:58.572 --> 29:00.427
An assistant D.A.
got hit last night.

29:00.433 --> 29:01.828
Hopper's a prime suspect.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.650
There's a warrant out
for his arrest.

29:04.596 --> 29:06.277
There must be some mistake.

29:06.530 --> 29:08.435
Yeah, it's kinda hard to believe.
You think you know someone,

29:08.441 --> 29:11.717
- then they do something crazy like that.
- Chad, Brett didn't kill anyone.

29:11.940 --> 29:13.336
I hear it different.

29:14.424 --> 29:16.023
Sorry to be the one to tell you.

29:16.025 --> 29:17.154
Hopper's in real trouble.

29:17.167 --> 29:19.588
There are a couple guys downtown
wanna talk to you about it.

29:23.143 --> 29:24.854
Look, you don't have to go,

29:24.868 --> 29:26.829
but it might be helpful...

29:26.977 --> 29:28.277
for Hopper's sake.

29:31.391 --> 29:32.285
Okay.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.205
Just let me get my bag.

29:41.919 --> 29:44.016
- Hopper, what are you doing here ?
- Where is she ?

29:44.020 --> 29:45.810
- Where's who ?
- The girl, Baxter.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.141
What... I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:48.173 --> 29:50.873
5'7", dark hair, blue eyes,

29:51.089 --> 29:53.126
- legs that won't quit.
- How do you...

29:53.141 --> 29:54.871
What ? Are you following me ?

29:56.104 --> 29:57.278
Hopper !

30:01.802 --> 30:03.177
Hey, did you call me ?

30:03.190 --> 30:04.673
- Was it you ?
- What ?

30:04.677 --> 30:06.830
You called and left me a message
about this package.

30:06.863 --> 30:08.386
You said it was very important.

30:09.213 --> 30:10.792
- You're Hopper ?
- Yeah.

30:12.216 --> 30:14.224
He told me to call you.
He said that you'd understand.

30:14.230 --> 30:15.970
Who ?
Who told you to call me ?

30:16.005 --> 30:16.960
Garza.

30:17.922 --> 30:18.839
Garza ?

30:19.737 --> 30:21.321
Did he send me this package ?

30:30.688 --> 30:31.632
Yeah.

30:31.647 --> 30:34.021
He's here. Hopper... he's at my house
right now.

30:37.698 --> 30:38.652
Come on.

30:38.867 --> 30:41.710
I don't know how he found out,
but he's upstairs right now.

30:42.126 --> 30:43.932
Hello ? Hello ?

30:43.957 --> 30:46.215
Did you hear what I just said ?
Hopper is here.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.060
+

30:53.029 --> 30:55.143
Those guys for yours,
They work for you ?

30:55.157 --> 30:56.564
- Who ?
- The guys you were calling.

30:56.578 --> 30:59.038
- The ones who have been following me.
- What ? No...

30:59.042 --> 31:02.087
- those guys are squeezing me.
- You're gonna tell me everything.

31:02.103 --> 31:04.368
- They'll kill me.
- I'll kill you !

31:10.245 --> 31:11.361
Calmate.

31:11.375 --> 31:13.404
Calmate.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.649
Just answer their questions
truthfully.

31:29.666 --> 31:31.002
They're not after you.

31:33.039 --> 31:34.647
Remember, I got your back.

31:35.256 --> 31:36.986
I'll be all right, Chad.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.361
You're Jennifer,
right, Brett's sister ?

31:41.373 --> 31:42.759
- Yeah.
- Rita, right ?

31:42.782 --> 31:45.311
Yeah. I just want you to know
that everything's gonna be okay.

31:45.316 --> 31:47.180
Brett was with me last night.

31:47.378 --> 31:49.704
With you ?
But I thought...

31:52.201 --> 31:53.635
so you two...

31:53.888 --> 31:55.756
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.

31:55.769 --> 31:57.768
I've been trying to get a number
for your mom.

31:57.784 --> 32:00.435
Oh, that's not a good idea.
She and Brett don't really talk anymore.

32:00.449 --> 32:02.527
Real tight family you got there, huh ?

32:05.304 --> 32:07.762
Listen, if I hear anything,
I'm gonna give you a call.

32:07.777 --> 32:09.356
I'm sure he's okay.

32:09.579 --> 32:10.650
Thank you.

32:18.010 --> 32:18.636
No.

32:19.907 --> 32:21.984
You gotta call Damien.

32:21.989 --> 32:24.189
You're making a big mistake.

32:24.196 --> 32:26.818
- You're making... Call Damien !
- Help.

32:27.630 --> 32:28.449
Hey !

32:29.421 --> 32:31.730
Where are they taking us ?
What are they gonna do ?

32:31.773 --> 32:32.688
You don't want to know.

32:32.721 --> 32:34.509
We gotta get outta here, Hopper.
We gotta get out.

32:34.524 --> 32:36.791
Damien knows you sold him out.

32:36.806 --> 32:39.153
- What ? No, I would never do that.
- Shut up.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.696
Don't waste your breath.

32:41.334 --> 32:42.593
He knows.

32:43.423 --> 32:45.087
Now your only hope of
getting out of here is me,

32:45.094 --> 32:47.371
so you better start talking.

32:48.689 --> 32:50.850
I never got their names.
They came to me a couple of days ago.

32:50.858 --> 32:53.461
Two men said they wanted
information about Damien.

32:53.476 --> 32:54.813
Why Damien ?

32:55.172 --> 32:56.846
- Why Damien ?!
- The latin disciples

32:56.860 --> 32:59.560
are getting into contract killings.
Damien knows names.

32:59.574 --> 33:01.422
What does that have
to do with Garza or me ?

33:01.434 --> 33:03.433
I have no idea.
I swear.

33:04.256 --> 33:05.966
Damien was my informant,

33:06.049 --> 33:07.884
and you used me to get at him.

33:07.899 --> 33:09.638
I didn't want to.
They held a gun to my head.

33:09.653 --> 33:12.016
- Me or him ? I'm gonna pick me.
- I vouched for you, man.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.774
I guaranteed Damien his life.

33:13.786 --> 33:15.996
Hey, Damien knew exactly
what he was getting into.

33:16.012 --> 33:17.975
In case you forgot, Hopper,
Damien is the bad guy.

33:17.977 --> 33:19.344
I don't care who he is.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.888
- I gave him my word.
- Will you grow up, Hopper ?

33:21.900 --> 33:23.525
Damien's a killer
and a drug dealer.

33:23.542 --> 33:25.916
- He's getting exactly what he deserves.
- Oh, okay.

33:26.234 --> 33:28.485
Well, you're gonna get
exactly what you deserve.

33:28.490 --> 33:30.833
Because when we reach
that parking structure,

33:31.051 --> 33:32.791
Damien's gonna put a bullet

33:32.804 --> 33:34.162
in your head.

33:39.633 --> 33:41.758
So you're telling us you were
with Hopper last night ?

33:41.761 --> 33:42.421
Yes.

33:43.948 --> 33:46.350
And he never went out,
maybe went for a walk ?

33:46.367 --> 33:48.117
I was with him all night.

33:48.792 --> 33:51.531
Well, I appreciate that, and
I want to believe you, I really do.

33:53.252 --> 33:55.165
You know, when we ran
your driver's license,

33:55.181 --> 33:56.949
some interesting information
came up.

33:56.962 --> 33:58.226
That's not relevant.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.661
We were just wondering if Mr. Shelton
could clarify a few things.

34:00.674 --> 34:02.579
I mean, this isn't the first time
that she's been involved

34:02.582 --> 34:03.996
in a questionable incident.

34:04.012 --> 34:05.236
Not going there.
Move along.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.516
Chad, if this is all too much
for you, you can go.

34:09.527 --> 34:11.141
I go, she goes.

34:11.435 --> 34:13.186
Next question.

34:25.321 --> 34:27.620
Any idea where Hopper is now ?

34:38.087 --> 34:39.280
Who was she ?

34:39.565 --> 34:40.471
Who ?

34:40.475 --> 34:42.665
The girl.
You seem pretty upset about her.

34:42.672 --> 34:45.706
Of course I'm upset about her. I got
my own problems to deal with right now.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.087
What was her name ?

34:47.398 --> 34:48.871
Ava.
Her name was Ava Reese.

34:48.884 --> 34:50.568
I met her at the courthouse
a couple of weeks ago.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.562
What's her connection to Garza ?

34:53.232 --> 34:55.259
She worked for him.
What the hell does it matter...

35:16.812 --> 35:18.438
Thank God,
it's you guys.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.913
Sorry, Hopper.

35:24.228 --> 35:25.457
You took my phone.

35:26.070 --> 35:26.970
+

37:16.031 --> 37:18.149
Thank you for the ride, Chad.

37:18.173 --> 37:20.431
And thank you for sticking up
for me back there.

37:20.433 --> 37:23.479
Oh, hey, what's in your background
is your business, not theirs.

37:23.655 --> 37:25.570
Your secret's safe with me.

37:26.419 --> 37:28.046
And yours with me.

37:29.105 --> 37:30.594
What secret is that ?

37:31.053 --> 37:33.234
That you're not always
such a hard-ass.

37:38.054 --> 37:39.858
Look, if you want,
I could stay over...

37:39.876 --> 37:41.441
on the couch, of course...

37:42.040 --> 37:43.590
and keep an eye on things.

37:45.714 --> 37:48.242
Let me at least walk you up.
If you feel okay, I'll go.

37:48.245 --> 37:50.581
No, I don't want to keep you.
I'm sure you have plans tonight.

37:50.595 --> 37:52.931
No, I'm just gonna
meet this guy in a bar.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.314
I can reschedule.

38:04.993 --> 38:05.830
Hello.

38:05.853 --> 38:08.353
<i>- Hey, it's me.
- Oh, thank God. Are you okay ?</i>

38:08.598 --> 38:09.724
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:09.729 --> 38:10.951
<i>Where are you ?</i>

38:11.473 --> 38:14.155
It's probably best I don't say.
They could be tapping your phone.

38:14.820 --> 38:17.558
They asked me a lot of questions.
They said terrible things about you.

38:17.576 --> 38:18.912
<i>None of it's true.</i>

38:19.203 --> 38:20.975
<i>I'm sorry they put you
through all that.</i>

38:23.579 --> 38:25.461
I just called to make sure
you were safe.

38:25.496 --> 38:26.576
Rita...

38:27.508 --> 38:28.561
<i>everything okay ?</i>

38:33.781 --> 38:34.881
I love you.

38:35.632 --> 38:36.825
I love you, too.

38:36.927 --> 38:38.801
When will I see you again ?

38:41.129 --> 38:42.283
Tomorrow.

38:44.314 --> 38:45.765
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.449
<i>- Rita ?
- Hopper, I need your help.</i>

39:15.692 --> 39:17.345
I've done something terrible.

39:17.350 --> 39:19.889
<i>Andrea ?
Andrea !</i>

39:20.448 --> 39:21.615
<i>Andrea.</i>
