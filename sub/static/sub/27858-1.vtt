Father, I know you're very busy,

00:31.814 --> 00:34.227
but may I have a word with you?

00:34.251 --> 00:39.039
Yes, my dear, I always
have time for my daughter.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.782
Whatever you need, just name
it, and it shall be yours.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.980
Even a prince?

00:48.004 --> 00:50.789
Not this again.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.942
With all due respect, father,

00:53.966 --> 00:56.597
I've done as you've
asked all my life.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.860
You know nothing
can take your place,

00:58.884 --> 01:00.949
or the place of our kingdom.

01:00.973 --> 01:05.257
But it's such a big world,
and there are so many things

01:05.282 --> 01:07.173
out there I have yet to learn,

01:07.197 --> 01:10.809
so many places to see
and people to meet.

01:11.723 --> 01:14.224
And dangers to face.

01:14.248 --> 01:17.009
Which you've
prepared me well for.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.315
I

01:18.339 --> 01:21.535
Our kingdom needs its princess.

01:21.559 --> 01:24.364
Our young dragons
look up to you.

01:24.388 --> 01:27.019
They'll look up to me
even more if I venture out,

01:27.043 --> 01:30.501
and find happiness
and success on my own,

01:30.525 --> 01:31.328
that

01:31.352 --> 01:33.286
and

01:33.310 --> 01:35.051
And what, my dear?

01:35.921 --> 01:38.074
And love.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.207
Have I not loved you enough?

01:41.231 --> 01:43.427
Oh, daddy, it isn't that.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.516
It's different.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.474
Different, how?

01:47.498 --> 01:49.935
You're still my
little girl, Cai.

01:51.546 --> 01:54.177
Your Majesty, if I may.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.613
Yes.

01:55.637 --> 02:00.076
Well, sire, what Princess
Cai is trying to say is

02:01.164 --> 02:02.402
well.

02:02.426 --> 02:05.362
Come on, Tinker
Toes, out with it!

02:05.386 --> 02:07.407
It's okay, Tinker.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.238
Your Majesty, Princess Cai will

02:12.262 --> 02:14.240
always be your little girl,

02:14.264 --> 02:16.590
but she isn't a
little girl anymore.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.288
She's all grown up,

02:18.312 --> 02:21.358
and she wants to spread
her wings and fly.

02:24.405 --> 02:27.732
Ah, my sweet, sweet
dragon princess,

02:27.756 --> 02:32.040
you must be aware you
have conflicting desires.

02:32.064 --> 02:35.609
Finding the love of a
prince is best achieved

02:35.633 --> 02:39.657
within the safety and
comfort of your kingdom.

02:39.681 --> 02:43.400
Seeking freedom and
adventure is the best way

02:43.424 --> 02:45.706
to delay meeting that prince,

02:45.730 --> 02:50.494
and to risk losing
everything you have.

02:50.518 --> 02:53.932
But father, how will I
ever know what life is about,

02:53.956 --> 02:55.629
if I never try.

02:55.653 --> 02:59.503
Remaining in the kingdom will
give me everything I need,

02:59.527 --> 03:03.507
whenever I need it, but
how will I gain wisdom

03:03.531 --> 03:05.683
if I never know the unknown.

03:05.707 --> 03:09.252
And if I have to strike out
into the great unknown alone,

03:09.276 --> 03:11.384
so be it!

03:18.067 --> 03:19.523
Good day, Durwin.

03:19.547 --> 03:23.135
I see you're busy doing
nothing, as always.

03:23.159 --> 03:26.660
You again, what do
you want, Blister?

03:26.684 --> 03:28.488
I just want to know
if you've any thought

03:28.512 --> 03:31.883
to my rather generous offer.

03:31.907 --> 03:35.278
You mean you're
offer to work for you?

03:35.302 --> 03:37.367
Yes, that's the one.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.415
I have.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.875
You have, and?

03:45.486 --> 03:49.248
And I think it's about the
funniest thing I've ever heard.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.423
Funny?

03:50.447 --> 03:52.164
Yes, funny.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.863
You have a talent, Blister.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.039
You should think
about performing

03:58.063 --> 04:00.651
for the king's court sometime.

04:00.675 --> 04:03.436
I'm sure you'd make
everyone laugh.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.700
Everyone?

04:06.724 --> 04:08.485
Yes, everyone.

04:08.509 --> 04:14.317
Everyone who heard you would
surely laugh their tails off.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.753
Oh they would, would they?

04:15.777 --> 04:17.755
Now, run along!

04:17.779 --> 04:21.019
Durwin's thinking, in
case you didn't notice.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.587
I didn't, I guess
it's easy to miss.

04:23.611 --> 04:26.590
Well, I'm certainly sorry
to hear that, Durwin.

04:26.614 --> 04:30.071
I was so hoping you'd
come along, willingly.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.595
Oh?

04:31.619 --> 04:33.534
But since you won't,

04:34.839 --> 04:38.341
from the plains of war and
the belly of the beast!

04:38.365 --> 04:39.864
Are you casting a

04:39.888 --> 04:42.673
a spell, Wee Dragon?

04:43.544 --> 04:46.087
Oppose me and starve,

04:46.111 --> 04:49.811
but serve me, you'll feast.

05:11.746 --> 05:15.465
How many times have we
walked the same path, Big Gurt?

05:15.489 --> 05:16.683
I don't know, Boyle.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.772
Hey, is this a pop quiz?

05:18.796 --> 05:23.429
No, hotshot, and it's not
a rhetorical question either!

05:23.453 --> 05:24.628
Rhetorical?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.651
Is that that one
wee dragon who lives

05:27.675 --> 05:28.913
up on the volcano?

05:31.200 --> 05:33.787
Big Gurt, you're my best bud.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.615
Sometimes, I'm not sure why,

05:35.639 --> 05:39.184
but you definitely
are my best bud.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.794
You're my bestie too, Boyle.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.014
I love it when we
take long walks.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.581
That's kind of my point, Gurt.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.626
We've taken a lot of long walks.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.237
I mean, a lot!

05:49.261 --> 05:51.283
They're good for
our leg muscles.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.590
Yes, yes, they are!

05:53.614 --> 05:56.027
But that's not really
my point here, buddy.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.029
Right, if we flap our wings too,

05:58.053 --> 05:59.726
it's like a full-body workout.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.555
They call it cardio!

06:02.579 --> 06:04.122
Oh boy.

06:04.146 --> 06:07.430
Look, Gurt, I've spent my
whole life here in the kingdom.

06:07.454 --> 06:10.911
I hear stories of what
goes on in other places,

06:10.935 --> 06:12.739
but they're just stories.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.698
I'd like to find
out what's going on

06:14.722 --> 06:16.961
in the world, for myself.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.789
You're gonna leave
us, aren't you?

06:18.813 --> 06:23.208
I'm not gonna lie, Gurt, I'd
leave right now, if not for

06:24.296 --> 06:25.839
If not for what, Boyle?

06:25.863 --> 06:28.364
If not for Princess Cai.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.105
Princess Cai, what's
she got to do with it?

06:31.129 --> 06:34.282
She's pretty cool,
don't you think?

06:34.306 --> 06:38.069
You, Boyle, have a
crush on Princess Cai.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.985
Okay.

06:41.009 --> 06:43.596
I can't fool you, you're right.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.858
I know!

06:44.882 --> 06:46.860
But it's worse than you think.

06:46.884 --> 06:47.818
It is?

06:50.714 --> 06:54.738
I'm in love with
the princess, Gurt.

06:54.762 --> 06:55.826
Wow!

06:55.850 --> 06:58.219
Love, is she gonna get married?

06:58.243 --> 06:59.612
Gurt!

06:59.636 --> 07:01.658
Oh, does she

07:01.682 --> 07:03.573
you know, know?

07:03.597 --> 07:05.966
I haven't figured out
how to tell her yet.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.794
Oh.

07:07.818 --> 07:08.665
Are you gonna?

07:08.689 --> 07:10.449
When I know the best way.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.930
I can't just walk up to
her with my dragon breath,

07:12.954 --> 07:17.500
and say, hey there, royalty,
I think I love you!

07:17.524 --> 07:19.415
She's the king's daughter.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.765
She can have any
dragon she wants.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.419
I need to impress her!

07:23.443 --> 07:24.768
Sounds complicated.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.229
It is, Gurt, it is!

07:30.275 --> 07:32.166
There you guys are.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.865
I've been looking everywhere.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.432
What is it, Gergle?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.544
It's Durwin!

07:38.762 --> 07:40.697
I see Durwin up
there in his castle.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.439
What's he doing,
snoring too loud?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.876
No, I saw him breath fire.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.704
He's been unleashed!

07:47.728 --> 07:50.750
Unleashed, wait a minute!

07:50.774 --> 07:53.361
Only a sorcerer's spell could
unleash a dormant dragon.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.972
Who?

07:54.996 --> 08:00.151
Blister, Blister cast a spell
and turned Durwin ferocious!

08:00.175 --> 08:01.108
Oh no!

08:01.132 --> 08:04.285
Blister, this is bad!

08:04.309 --> 08:06.723
This is real bad.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.900
Now that you're finally
in my employ, Durwin,

08:09.924 --> 08:13.077
I shall use your mighty
power to gain access

08:13.101 --> 08:14.948
to the kingdom of the Goblins.

08:14.972 --> 08:18.212
There, I can assemble
an army to lead me

08:18.236 --> 08:20.911
to the kingdom of
the Wee Dragons,

08:20.935 --> 08:23.696
and topple King Bedwyr
from his throne.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.874
Once I achieve that,
I will rule the world.

08:29.683 --> 08:32.009
The kingdom will fall.

08:32.033 --> 08:36.796
Wee Dragon Blister
will rule the world.

08:36.820 --> 08:40.496
And don't forget, with mighty
dragon Durwin by my side.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.044
That has a nice ring
to it, doesn't it?

08:47.918 --> 08:49.311
It does, indeed.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.986
Let's hurry now, to
the Goblin kingdom.

08:53.010 --> 08:57.014
The sooner we arrive, the
sooner my plan can be executed.

08:59.451 --> 09:03.910
And then Blister raised
his arms and launched into

09:03.934 --> 09:08.939
some incantation that made
Durwin get all crazy-looking.

09:10.288 --> 09:14.094
I'm telling you guys, I've
never seen him like that.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.619
He didn't even try to
fight back or nothing?

09:16.643 --> 09:19.317
Durwin's so much bigger
than that squirt, Blister.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.798
It's not that simple, Gurt.

09:21.822 --> 09:26.890
Blister knew this spell
and used it to perfection.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.283
Durwin's strength
was meaningless,

09:29.307 --> 09:31.416
because his mind was

09:31.440 --> 09:33.026
it was attacked.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.637
No one could stand a chance

09:34.661 --> 09:38.684
against an evil spell well
cast, not even might Durwin!

09:38.708 --> 09:40.773
With sorcery, the
smallest minion can

09:40.797 --> 09:42.775
bring down the tallest, giant!

09:42.799 --> 09:45.822
Wow!

09:45.846 --> 09:50.566
Once the spell was cast,
Blister and Durwin were

09:50.590 --> 09:52.417
obviously in alliance.

09:53.897 --> 09:58.312
They flew off together,
thick as thieves they were.

09:58.336 --> 10:01.533
I can't say for sure
where they're going,

10:01.557 --> 10:05.450
or what they're up
to, but I have to say,

10:05.474 --> 10:10.479
I fear for the safety of
every Wee Dragon in the land.

10:11.915 --> 10:14.285
Oh boy, that makes me wanna
hide under a mighty rock

10:14.309 --> 10:15.852
and never come out.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.854
Gergle, from what you're
telling us, I'm afraid

10:17.878 --> 10:21.379
our kingdom of the Wee
Dragons is in grave danger.

10:21.403 --> 10:25.862
Indeed, Boyle, it
doesn't bode well.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.691
Is there any way to
reverse an evil spell?

10:28.715 --> 10:32.651
I'm not a sorcerer, I don't
even know any sorcerers.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.611
What on wee earth can we do?

10:35.635 --> 10:40.224
I can only think of one thing.

10:40.248 --> 10:45.882
It might be the kingdom's
best and only chance.

10:45.906 --> 10:46.907
Tell me, what is it?

10:48.517 --> 10:52.739
Emrick the sorcerer may be
the only one who can intervene.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.153
Old Emrick, he's
bonkers, isn't he?

11:04.098 --> 11:07.338
I just don't know
what to do, Tinker Toes.

11:07.362 --> 11:10.646
I want to experience the world,

11:10.670 --> 11:13.953
but I also don't
wanna do it alone.

11:13.977 --> 11:18.044
It would be amazing to
hold the claw of my love,

11:18.068 --> 11:21.918
while seeing new lands,
and meeting new dragons.

11:21.942 --> 11:25.138
Alas, I haven't met that love.

11:25.162 --> 11:28.664
Maybe, he's out there and
you have to go find him?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.601
You think so?

11:30.472 --> 11:32.624
Stranger things have happened.

11:32.648 --> 11:35.235
Maybe, this wanderlust
is the universe's way

11:35.259 --> 11:37.803
of telling you to get out
there, and when you do,

11:37.827 --> 11:39.457
good things will happen.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.938
And you'll end up with
everything you desire,

11:41.962 --> 11:45.289
travel, adventure, and love!

11:45.313 --> 11:47.900
Oh, Tinker, I can
always count on you

11:47.924 --> 11:50.468
to put things in perspective.

11:50.492 --> 11:53.776
You are my princess,
and I'm here to serve.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.779
I should start planning
my journey right away.

11:56.803 --> 12:00.043
Why wait, there's no
time like the present?

12:08.945 --> 12:12.055
Hurry, Big Gurt, we
gotta find Emrick, ASAP!

12:12.079 --> 12:14.797
I'm flying as fast
as I can fly, Boyle.

12:16.387 --> 12:19.627
Too many trapped-leery-con
eggs for breakfast.

12:31.576 --> 12:36.016
Boyle and Big
Gurt, I've been expecting you.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.951
You have?

12:38.975 --> 12:42.868
Well, of course, I'm
a sorcerer, aren't I?

12:42.892 --> 12:47.897
I see everything
two steps before it happens.

12:49.464 --> 12:53.163
You ate too many trapped-a-leery-con
eggs earlier today.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.968
Wow!

12:55.992 --> 12:59.232
Emrick, if you knew
we were coming, then

12:59.256 --> 13:02.061
you must know why we're here.

13:02.085 --> 13:04.934
Indeed, Wee Dragon,

13:04.958 --> 13:07.980
your kindred Blister
has used a spell

13:08.004 --> 13:11.157
to enlist the services

13:11.181 --> 13:15.727
of the feared mighty
dragon, Durwin.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.079
That's right, so how can we
break the spell and stop them?

13:20.103 --> 13:21.104
We can't.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.866
Excuse me?

13:23.890 --> 13:27.304
Sorry, you're out of luck.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.610
What do you mean,
we're out of luck?

13:29.634 --> 13:31.395
Yeah, I don't feel
very lucky at all.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.137
How could we have run
out, if we never had any?

13:34.161 --> 13:36.226
You're a sorcerer, Emrick.

13:36.250 --> 13:39.925
More than that, you're
the sorcerer around here.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.797
No way, little Blister
is anywhere near

13:41.821 --> 13:43.407
as powerful as you are.

13:43.431 --> 13:47.237
It's not just any spell, Boyle.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.830
Blister has cast
the Wyvern spell.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.659
Oh no, what's the Wyvern spell?

13:56.139 --> 13:58.378
The Wyvern spell

13:58.402 --> 14:04.080
was first cast 13 score
and four years ago,

14:04.104 --> 14:07.170
by Pure-gum the Insufferable.

14:07.194 --> 14:10.477
It leveled the great
towers of Billet,

14:10.501 --> 14:13.374
and plunged our land into chaos,

14:14.592 --> 14:15.985
for a millennium.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.051
I remember reading about that

14:19.075 --> 14:21.097
in Wee history class.

14:21.121 --> 14:21.904
You can read?

14:23.297 --> 14:26.798
Not really,
it was a picture book.

14:26.822 --> 14:31.498
The Wyvern spell
is not easily broken.

14:31.522 --> 14:36.068
Only the great dragon
Queen Sah-Goom-rue was able

14:36.092 --> 14:39.139
to reverse it,
and at great cost.

14:40.314 --> 14:44.294
It hasn't been used
by anyone since,

14:44.318 --> 14:49.323
and remains the darkest
chapter in Wee history.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.432
Whatever the spell
is levied against

14:52.456 --> 14:55.285
shall be destroyed.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.700
Oh boy, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.181
Are you saying
we can only sit by

15:02.205 --> 15:04.314
and wait for the
kingdom to be destroyed?

15:04.338 --> 15:05.078
No, Boyle,

15:06.601 --> 15:08.884
you can at least warn

15:08.908 --> 15:13.913
King Bedwyr the Tremendous
that big trouble Cometh.

15:15.131 --> 15:18.110
Oh great, that makes
me feel a lot better.

15:18.134 --> 15:21.766
It does, 'cause I
still feel pretty queasy.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.769
Go forth, Wee Dragons.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.119
I bestow on upon you

15:27.143 --> 15:30.949
the Boba spell of protection,

15:30.973 --> 15:35.935
to see that you reach
your destination safely.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.088
Well that sounds good, I
feel a little bit better.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.487
Hey, I feel a little quicker

15:47.511 --> 15:49.402
with Emrick's protection
spell over us.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.751
How about you?

15:50.775 --> 15:52.362
About the same here, Boyle.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.625
Well, I'm glad I didn't eat

15:54.649 --> 15:57.715
as many trapped-a-leery-con
eggs as you, Big Gurt.

15:57.739 --> 16:00.065
You think we can get
to the king in time?

16:00.089 --> 16:02.154
I hope so, Boyle, I hope so.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.409
Halt, who goes there?

16:16.540 --> 16:19.302
Are you the mighty dragon?

16:19.326 --> 16:20.588
And you look

16:21.806 --> 16:24.568
slight, you miniature thing.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.787
Oh, I do, do I?

16:26.811 --> 16:29.965
What do you two
interlopers want?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.184
Just a moment of your time.

16:32.208 --> 16:36.188
My name's Blister, and
this hulking Goliath

16:36.212 --> 16:38.756
is my trusty servant, Durwin.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.193
I notice you're all
by yourself here

16:41.217 --> 16:44.631
in this big, old
castle, King Foul.

16:44.655 --> 16:48.461
It must get terribly
lonely at times, eh?

16:48.485 --> 16:51.464
I don't need any roommates.

16:51.488 --> 16:55.338
Oh, I'm not suggesting
a roommate, king.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.253
I'm offering a wife.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.321
Well,

16:59.279 --> 17:01.324
thank you for the offer, but

17:02.412 --> 17:05.782
I can't suffer a wife, blah.

17:05.807 --> 17:08.873
I wouldn't be so
quick to refuse, king.

17:08.896 --> 17:13.182
The bride I propose is none
other than Princess Cai,

17:13.205 --> 17:17.098
from the kingdom
of the Wee Dragons.

17:17.123 --> 17:17.906
Princess Cai?

17:19.951 --> 17:23.627
Yes, surely you're interested
in the chance to have her

17:23.651 --> 17:26.325
on your goblin arm, no?

17:26.348 --> 17:27.133
Well!

17:29.483 --> 17:33.985
Your throne is known and
feared, far and wide, King Foul.

17:34.009 --> 17:37.206
The one thing it's missing
is the proper queen

17:37.230 --> 17:40.383
to complement such
a notorious king.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.820
I won't argue that,

17:42.844 --> 17:47.390
and though Princess Cai
shares unfortunate genes

17:47.414 --> 17:52.308
with that primitive
monkey-brain, King Bedwyr,

17:52.332 --> 17:54.701
she's young enough

17:54.725 --> 17:56.312
that her mind

17:56.336 --> 17:59.339
can still be righted.

18:00.992 --> 18:05.277
And I can think of no
righter than you, King Foul.

18:05.301 --> 18:10.306
Well, it seems we see some
things eye-to-eye, Wee Dragon.

18:12.743 --> 18:16.984
But the question remains,
how is that you've come

18:17.008 --> 18:21.554
to deal the princess's
hand in marriage?

18:21.578 --> 18:25.210
Argh, that's easy, the
laws of the lands dictate

18:25.234 --> 18:28.387
that an imprisoned monarch
cede his territory,

18:28.411 --> 18:32.478
and his power to the
next, nearest monarch.

18:32.502 --> 18:36.743
King Bedwyr's been
imprisoned, by whom?

18:36.767 --> 18:39.616
By you, King Foul.

18:39.640 --> 18:43.185
And as the next, nearest
monarch, it would seem

18:43.209 --> 18:47.058
that you've not only
claimed Bedwyr's territory,

18:47.082 --> 18:49.539
the kingdom of the Wee Dragons,

18:49.563 --> 18:54.196
but also his daughter,
the lovely Princess Cai.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.633
And as controller of
the princess's fate,

18:56.657 --> 19:02.421
you can arrange her marriage
or marry her yourself.

19:02.445 --> 19:06.338
You certainly are a devious,

19:06.362 --> 19:09.409
little runt of a
dragon, Blister.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.345
Thank you for the
compliment, king.

19:13.369 --> 19:18.394
I shall take King Bedwyr
into custody immediately,

19:18.418 --> 19:23.181
and see that he is
brought up on charges.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.446
That sounds delightful.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.405
What will the charges be?

19:29.429 --> 19:31.276
Who cares?

19:31.300 --> 19:34.540
I'll be the highest authority

19:34.564 --> 19:37.500
in both our lands.

19:37.524 --> 19:41.460
I'll figure out the charge
once we have him.

19:41.484 --> 19:44.724
I can't believe I
never thought of this.

19:44.748 --> 19:49.381
You can thank me later,
perhaps with some gold bullion

19:49.405 --> 19:52.602
or one of your river's
three-headed goblin trout.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.821
They're delicious snacks!

19:54.845 --> 19:57.563
That they are.

19:57.587 --> 20:00.914
I'll get you a net full
of them, how's that?

20:00.938 --> 20:05.441
Just answer me one
question first.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.879
As an obvious Wee Dragon,

20:08.903 --> 20:11.316
why in the world
are you assisting

20:11.340 --> 20:15.364
the downfall of
your own kingdom?

20:15.388 --> 20:18.454
Why not, the kingdom
of the Wee Dragons has

20:18.478 --> 20:19.803
never done me right.

20:19.827 --> 20:23.154
I've tried to fit in,
get along, endear myself

20:23.178 --> 20:26.984
to those winged twerps, but
only got the door slammed

20:27.008 --> 20:29.291
in my face, again and again.

20:29.315 --> 20:32.555
They don't take
Blister seriously.

20:32.579 --> 20:36.776
I will take over the kingdom
and become their ruler.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.215
I will make them
take me seriously.

20:43.677 --> 20:47.570
We have a deal!

21:13.533 --> 21:15.728
Halt, what's your
business, Wees?

21:15.752 --> 21:19.166
We're here to see King
Bedwyr the Tremendous.

21:19.190 --> 21:22.387
You and everybody
else, move along!

21:22.411 --> 21:23.562
Well, it's important.

21:23.586 --> 21:26.348
It's always important.

21:26.372 --> 21:29.525
You know how many times
a day I meet Wee Dragons,

21:29.549 --> 21:31.115
looking to get to
the king's ear?

21:32.029 --> 21:34.530
No, is it a lot?

21:34.554 --> 21:36.619
And what do they want
to do with his ear?

21:36.643 --> 21:38.708
With all due respect, guard,

21:38.732 --> 21:41.754
our business is different than
anything you've heard before.

21:41.778 --> 21:44.235
The survival of the kingdom
depends on us warning

21:44.259 --> 21:46.542
King Bedwyr of
the coming danger!

21:46.566 --> 21:49.849
Uh-huh, I've heard
that one before too.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.938
Why don't you two fly along?

21:51.962 --> 21:54.854
The castle is no
place for tomfoolery.

21:54.878 --> 21:57.770
Who's tomfoolery,
I'm so confused?

21:57.794 --> 22:00.382
Look, if you
insist on persisting,

22:00.406 --> 22:04.429
I'll have no choice but
to place you under arrest.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.692
Okay, okay.

22:06.716 --> 22:09.042
Can we at least relay
a message for the king?

22:09.066 --> 22:12.350
We're not kidding,
it's super important!

22:12.374 --> 22:13.873
Yeah!

22:13.897 --> 22:17.399
You have three seconds to
get off the royal property

22:17.423 --> 22:19.966
or both of you are under arrest!

22:33.439 --> 22:35.199
I'll take it from here!

22:35.223 --> 22:38.420
Wow!

22:38.444 --> 22:41.771
Did I hear you say, you
need to speak to my father?

22:41.795 --> 22:43.294
Yes!

22:43.318 --> 22:46.930
And neither of us is
tomfoolery, just so you know.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.693
Okay.

22:50.717 --> 22:53.783
We have something very
important to tell the king.

22:53.807 --> 22:56.046
Our land is in grave
danger, and he needs

22:56.070 --> 22:57.961
to know about it, stat!

22:57.985 --> 22:59.571
Why did you call her stat?

22:59.595 --> 23:01.573
Just follow me here, Gurt.

23:01.597 --> 23:05.142
If there's any way we can see
the king, just for a minute,

23:05.166 --> 23:08.363
I'd be eternally
grateful, princess.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.453
Well, since you're using
terms like eternally,

23:11.477 --> 23:14.194
I guess I should let you in.

23:14.218 --> 23:15.089
Wow.

23:16.307 --> 23:17.874
I mean, yeah.

23:22.226 --> 23:25.162
I hope we haven't
disturbed you, father.

23:25.186 --> 23:28.774
May these two Wee Dragons
have a word with you?

23:28.798 --> 23:31.603
Whoa, what's the
meaning of this, Cai?

23:31.627 --> 23:33.649
Who are they?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.607
Sorry to interrupt you, king.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.609
My name's Boyle.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.611
And I'm Gurt.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.744
My friends call me Big Gurt.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.659
How did you get in here?

23:43.683 --> 23:47.532
My guards have instructions
not to grant entry

23:47.556 --> 23:49.428
to anyone without
an appointment.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.058
I let them in, daddy.

23:52.082 --> 23:52.866
Cai?

23:54.084 --> 23:55.888
I made a judgment call.

23:55.912 --> 23:58.761
I'm old enough to
do that, you know?

23:58.785 --> 24:01.024
They seem honest and they say

24:01.048 --> 24:03.635
they have great
danger to report.

24:03.659 --> 24:06.333
Very well, out
with it, Wee Dragon.

24:06.357 --> 24:10.512
What is this great danger
I need to be aware of?

24:10.536 --> 24:12.557
King, we got word from a friend

24:12.581 --> 24:15.168
that there's big
trouble headed our way.

24:15.192 --> 24:18.041
Yeah, something
wicked this way comes.

24:18.065 --> 24:21.740
Let me see if I understand.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.743
You're here because
you heard a rumor

24:24.767 --> 24:27.529
of trouble from a friend?

24:27.553 --> 24:28.791
Well,

24:28.815 --> 24:31.881
Yes, but a very trustworthy one!

24:32.993 --> 24:35.188
Cai, my sweet daughter,

24:35.212 --> 24:37.756
I know you yearn to
spread your wings,

24:37.780 --> 24:40.803
but you really must
stop being so gullible.

24:40.827 --> 24:44.720
I'm calling my guards to
remove these two immediately.

24:44.744 --> 24:45.527
Wait, king.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.943
It's Blister, he cast the
Wyvern spell on Durwin,

24:50.967 --> 24:53.816
and they're planning
to destroy the kingdom.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.426
Blister, what?

24:55.450 --> 24:59.865
That Wee Dragon's been trouble
since the day he was born.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.476
I know, right?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.607
Did you say

25:02.631 --> 25:05.436
the Wyvern spell?

25:05.460 --> 25:08.047
Yes, the Wyvern spell!

25:08.071 --> 25:10.441
The Wyvern spell, indeed.

25:10.465 --> 25:13.468
Do we know where Blister
and Durwin are now?

25:17.907 --> 25:20.930
Durwin, we're on the
precipice of greatness.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.801
Once King Bedwyr
is out of the way,

25:22.825 --> 25:25.674
we'll have limitless power!

25:25.698 --> 25:27.719
Yeah, master.

25:27.743 --> 25:31.157
With your help, I
will write my name

25:31.181 --> 25:34.770
our names in history
as the mightiest

25:34.794 --> 25:36.728
and most feared
rulers the kingdom

25:36.752 --> 25:40.123
of the Wee Dragons
has ever seen.

25:40.147 --> 25:43.256
In fact, I'll rename the land.

25:44.499 --> 25:48.784
How does Blist-Wyne
Kingdom sound?

25:53.943 --> 25:56.835
Then Blist-Wyne
Kingdom it shall be!

25:56.859 --> 26:01.927
And every Wee Dragon, who
never took Blister seriously,

26:01.951 --> 26:05.627
will eat their words
and quake in their paws.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.151
With you and King
Foul on my side,

26:08.175 --> 26:10.806
and the power of
the Wyvern spell,

26:10.830 --> 26:14.505
it's only a matter of time now.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.376
I'm no expert in war, king,

26:16.400 --> 26:18.596
but maybe we should
fortify the castle

26:18.620 --> 26:20.467
and put all the
guard on high alert.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.774
If Blister and Durwin
try a sneak attack,

26:22.798 --> 26:24.602
we'd be smart to prepare for it!

26:24.626 --> 26:27.474
You may be no
expert, but you sound

26:27.498 --> 26:29.892
like a natural, little Boyle.

26:32.025 --> 26:35.526
My issue is that
the Wyvern spell is

26:35.550 --> 26:38.485
for expert practitioners.

26:38.509 --> 26:42.664
Wizards with centuries of
experience have been unable

26:42.688 --> 26:44.709
to wrangle its power.

26:44.733 --> 26:47.973
The idea of that little
Blister would master it

26:47.997 --> 26:52.238
out of the blue
seems farfetched.

26:52.262 --> 26:57.093
I'm willing to bet Blister
is all bluster, as usual.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.987
I shall tell the
guards to stand down.

27:02.011 --> 27:04.555
We'll keep an eye
out, but I'm not going

27:04.579 --> 27:08.646
to start taking little
Blister seriously now.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.083
You might be right
about that, father,

27:11.107 --> 27:12.824
but what if you're not?

27:12.848 --> 27:15.610
Gosh, are you sure
about this, king?

27:15.634 --> 27:19.352
You doubt the king's intuition?

27:20.595 --> 27:21.964
What's happening, Boyle?

27:21.988 --> 27:23.139
Oh no!

27:23.163 --> 27:24.749
Father?

27:24.773 --> 27:28.013
Princess, I'm sorry about
this terrible turn of events.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.146
I can't help but feeling
somehow responsible.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.409
It isn't your fault, Boyle.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.803
The spell is obviously real,

27:34.827 --> 27:39.198
and Blister is obviously as
dangerous as you say he is.

27:39.222 --> 27:42.095
For that, we can only thank you.

27:43.096 --> 27:44.987
I need you two to go
to the land of Zah,

27:45.011 --> 27:47.032
and find the all-knowing sage.

27:47.056 --> 27:50.949
He can help us,
if he so chooses.

27:50.973 --> 27:53.604
We shall be on our
way, Princess Cai.

27:53.628 --> 27:56.651
What about you,
princess, what will you do?

27:56.675 --> 27:59.349
One thing my father
always taught me it that

27:59.373 --> 28:02.961
if you want something done,
you've gotta do it yourself.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.703
I'm going to try
and find my father.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.487
Be careful, princess!

28:07.511 --> 28:11.491
Don't worry, I have Tinker
Toes to watch my back.

28:11.515 --> 28:13.493
Godspeed to you two.

28:13.517 --> 28:14.930
Godspeed, princess.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.149
We shall meet again, soon.

28:22.004 --> 28:25.854
Bedwyr, my old nemesis.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.770
Enjoy your new home,

28:28.794 --> 28:31.903
here in the Goblin kingdom,

28:31.927 --> 28:36.932
from a king to a prisoner.

28:38.281 --> 28:44.002
That's quite a trajectory,
you overrated swine.

28:46.594 --> 28:49.007
It's been a while, King Foul.

28:49.031 --> 28:53.577
And if you think you can break
my will with silly words,

28:53.601 --> 28:57.189
you're as
foolish as you've always been.

28:57.213 --> 29:00.889
I'll reclaim my
throne in no time,

29:00.913 --> 29:05.047
and you'll pay dearly
for this transgression.

29:07.702 --> 29:11.464
Ah, keep thinking
that, why don't you?

29:11.488 --> 29:14.032
In the meantime,

29:14.056 --> 29:18.950
Wee Blister will be the
new king of your land,

29:18.974 --> 29:23.979
because it's so worthless, I
want nothing to do with it.

29:25.067 --> 29:29.178
Except for one thing.

29:29.202 --> 29:34.207
One thing, and what is
that, you thieving creature?

29:35.208 --> 29:38.100
Your daughter, of course.

29:38.124 --> 29:40.102
The Princess Cai!

29:40.126 --> 29:42.582
How dare you!

29:42.606 --> 29:45.760
If you lay so much
as a claw on her...

29:45.784 --> 29:48.066
You'll do what?

29:48.090 --> 29:49.851
I'll have you...

29:49.875 --> 29:51.504
No.

29:51.528 --> 29:54.856
You'll do nothing, Bedwyr.

29:54.880 --> 29:59.295
Remember, I'm still king,

29:59.319 --> 30:01.993
and you're now my prisoner.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.866
You'll do as I say,

30:04.890 --> 30:10.436
and I say I'm taking your
daughter's hand in marriage.

30:10.460 --> 30:13.135
No way!

30:13.159 --> 30:17.617
Way, way, way!

30:17.641 --> 30:20.272
And if you behave,

30:20.296 --> 30:22.884
you may even receive

30:22.908 --> 30:25.930
an invitation to our wedding.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.794
Oh, Tinker Toes,
whatever will we do?

30:41.056 --> 30:44.296
I know I put on a strong
face for Boyle and Gurt,

30:44.320 --> 30:47.299
but I don't know if
there's anything we can do.

30:47.323 --> 30:51.913
I may never see my father again!

30:51.937 --> 30:53.740
Take heart, my princess,

30:53.764 --> 30:56.047
there's always help
when we need it.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.788
From who?

30:57.812 --> 31:01.226
Have you considered
the Mushroom Elves?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.750
The Mushroom Elves?

31:03.774 --> 31:05.491
Why no.

31:05.515 --> 31:06.971
I'd highly advise it.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.190
Through them, it's possible

31:08.214 --> 31:11.193
to gain entrance to
the Goblin kingdom.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.087
It is?

31:13.175 --> 31:14.979
Well, let's find them, Tinker.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.657
We've no time to waste.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.270
Boyle, I'm worried.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.119
Why, are you still
feeling the effects

31:24.143 --> 31:26.208
of those
trapped-a-leery-con eggs?

31:26.232 --> 31:27.687
No, it's not that,

31:27.711 --> 31:30.255
I'm worried about
the all-knowing sage.

31:30.279 --> 31:31.169
Why?

31:31.193 --> 31:32.867
He sounds like our best shot,

31:32.891 --> 31:35.260
besides the princess
recommended him.

31:35.284 --> 31:38.089
I doubt she'd take a chance
with her kingdom on the line.

31:38.113 --> 31:40.309
But he's got a temper.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.137
I've heard so many
stories about him.

31:42.161 --> 31:45.227
When he doesn't like
something, or someone,

31:45.251 --> 31:47.253
he can be a real savage.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.884
Well, we'll see about that.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.103
Let's find him
and make our case,

31:52.127 --> 31:54.192
then we'll see how
rational he is.

31:54.216 --> 31:57.176
I hope the rumors are
just that, for our sakes.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.116
Look at that, Durwin!

32:05.140 --> 32:10.145
All that land, all that
architecture, all those minions,

32:11.103 --> 32:12.907
are all ours!

32:18.240 --> 32:20.740
Let's settle in at the castle.

32:20.764 --> 32:23.854
Our castle!

32:30.035 --> 32:32.970
Tinker, we need to find
the Mushroom Elves' king,

32:32.994 --> 32:36.278
but I have no idea
where to look.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.280
Tell me about it,
we could've stepped

32:38.304 --> 32:40.499
right over him, for all I know.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.806
They all look the same to me.

32:42.830 --> 32:46.288
There is one creature
who may be able to help us,

32:46.312 --> 32:50.509
though I haven't seen
him in quite some time.

32:50.533 --> 32:54.035
He knows the comings and goings
of everyone in the forest.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.341
Nothing gets by him.

32:56.365 --> 32:59.214
That sounds like
quite the friend.

32:59.238 --> 33:01.738
Who is he, princess?

33:01.762 --> 33:05.220
Look, there he
is, it's Mold Spot.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.177
Him?

33:06.201 --> 33:07.396
No,

33:07.420 --> 33:08.701
him!

33:08.725 --> 33:12.314
Oh, he's not what I envisioned,

33:12.338 --> 33:13.382
at all.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.536
Hiya, lady, been a moldy minute.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.127
Where ya been hiding?

33:20.476 --> 33:22.628
In plain sight, Mold Spot.

33:22.652 --> 33:26.328
We haven't seen you around
the castle in a long time.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.112
How are you?

33:28.136 --> 33:29.984
Still growing, albeit slowly.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.247
What brings you to the
wrong side of the tracks?

33:32.271 --> 33:35.337
Oh, Moldy, I don't
know what to do!

33:35.361 --> 33:38.296
My father's been taken
by an evil spell,

33:38.320 --> 33:43.325
and the Wee Dragon Blister is
going to assume the throne!

33:44.457 --> 33:45.347
Great Scott,

33:45.371 --> 33:46.739
that's the worst news I've heard

33:46.763 --> 33:49.177
since the barter store
began carrying fungicide.

33:49.201 --> 33:52.049
Your father is a great
dragon and greater king.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.616
Is there anything
I can do to help?

33:53.640 --> 33:58.012
Perhaps, he's being held
captive in the Goblin kingdom.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.666
We need to go there and
try to break him out,

34:00.690 --> 34:02.320
but the Mushroom
Elves' king is the

34:02.344 --> 34:05.062
only one who can
show us the way.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.978
Can you tell us where
we can find him?

34:11.005 --> 34:13.636
Uh-oh, what does that mean?

34:13.659 --> 34:15.333
I'd highly advise both of you

34:15.357 --> 34:17.074
to steer clear of
the Goblin kingdom.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.597
The Mushroom Elves'
king recently lost

34:18.621 --> 34:20.512
all his gold to
thieving goblins,

34:20.536 --> 34:23.385
and is on the verge
of declaring war.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.821
It's not a good time!

34:24.844 --> 34:27.891
It's not a good time
for any of us, it seems.

34:29.110 --> 34:32.263
But Mold Spot, if I
don't find my father,

34:32.286 --> 34:36.050
I fear our kingdom
will be lost forever.

34:37.379 --> 34:39.053
Raising the the ire of
the Mushroom Elves' king

34:39.077 --> 34:40.860
is not advisable.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.319
I'd rather make an
enemy of that king,

34:44.342 --> 34:46.755
than lose my own forever.

34:46.780 --> 34:50.281
I wouldn't ask if I
knew of any other way.

34:50.304 --> 34:52.065
I'm sorry to hear of
your predicament, Cai.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.067
I'll help you,

34:53.091 --> 34:55.504
on one condition.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.202
Yes, just name it!

34:58.226 --> 34:59.986
Leave my name out of it.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.597
If the king asks
how you found him,

35:01.621 --> 35:03.642
throw someone else
under the cart.

35:03.666 --> 35:04.904
I don't need anymore enemies,

35:04.928 --> 35:06.341
and I don't need
that kind of trouble.

35:06.365 --> 35:07.516
Deal?

35:07.540 --> 35:08.952
Deal!

35:08.976 --> 35:10.475
All right, the
fastest to the land

35:10.499 --> 35:14.218
of the Mushroom Elves is through
the aisle of enchantment.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.177
There will be perils but
traveling the countryside

35:16.201 --> 35:17.526
will be five times the journey.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.832
And it sounds like
time is of the essence.

35:19.856 --> 35:22.424
Thank you so much, Mold Spot.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.926
I'd hug you

35:26.950 --> 35:30.539
but you're kind of stinky.

35:30.563 --> 35:33.237
It's okay,
princess, I'm used to it.

35:33.261 --> 35:35.370
No matter how much time passes,

35:35.394 --> 35:37.589
you're always such a friend.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.375
How can I ever repay you?

35:40.399 --> 35:42.420
Inviting me to the castle
sometime, if this all works out,

35:42.444 --> 35:44.770
and tell the servants
to hide the fungicide.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.120
Deal!

35:46.144 --> 35:48.339
Before you go, princess.

35:48.363 --> 35:49.819
Yes.

35:49.843 --> 35:52.454
You know you hail from
ancient dragon lineage, right?

35:54.239 --> 35:55.346
Well, yes, of course.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.782
Why do you say?

35:56.806 --> 36:00.438
You possess magical powers
you may not be aware of.

36:00.462 --> 36:02.136
I

36:02.160 --> 36:03.161
I do?

36:04.118 --> 36:05.617
Yes, they're in your blood.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.097
Sometimes, it just
takes a little while

36:07.121 --> 36:10.187
to recognize and master them.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.797
Whoa!

36:11.821 --> 36:14.539
It's wise to seek help
when we're in trouble,

36:14.563 --> 36:16.367
but don't count yourself out.

36:16.391 --> 36:19.457
You may not need anyone
but yourself, Cai.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.514
Look over there!

36:32.538 --> 36:37.543
There he is,
it's the all-knowing sage!

36:39.632 --> 36:41.305
I feel lightheaded.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.525
He he, it's just the altitude.

36:43.549 --> 36:45.091
We're high up in the mountains.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.485
Breathe in through your nose
and out through your mouth.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.095
You'll be okay.

36:49.119 --> 36:50.314
Yeah?

36:50.338 --> 36:52.708
Come on, stick close,
I'll do the talking.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.930
Thank goodness.

36:57.954 --> 36:58.868
Go no further.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.916
What brings you
mini-beasts to my lair?

37:04.526 --> 37:09.531
I had no idea your kind could
even survive in this altitude.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.728
Me neither.

37:12.752 --> 37:13.535
Sh!

37:14.884 --> 37:17.863
Pardon us, sage, but
we're in big trouble,

37:17.887 --> 37:20.866
and a friend recommended
we come talk to you.

37:20.890 --> 37:25.436
What friend could we possibly
have in common, squirt?

37:25.460 --> 37:27.482
Princess Cai, sir.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.310
King Bedwyr.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.205
How is that old boy?

37:32.075 --> 37:35.446
I haven't seen him in ages.

37:35.470 --> 37:38.971
Well, he's not well, sir.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.103
Oh?

37:40.127 --> 37:42.453
The king's been kidnapped!

37:42.477 --> 37:43.585
Kidnapped?

37:43.609 --> 37:45.587
By whom?

37:45.611 --> 37:47.502
By King Foul the Raffle,

37:47.526 --> 37:49.634
who's holding Bedwyr prisoner
in the Goblin kingdom,

37:49.658 --> 37:51.462
so that our Wee
brother, Blister,

37:51.486 --> 37:54.509
who cast a Wyvern spell,
can take over the throne

37:54.533 --> 37:56.274
and rule our kingdom!

37:57.492 --> 38:01.690
Goodness gracious,
you've got a lot going on.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.779
That we do, sir,
and we haven't taken

38:03.803 --> 38:05.650
this decision to
find you, lightly.

38:05.674 --> 38:08.174
We don't know else to do!

38:08.198 --> 38:11.201
Well, what makes
you think I know?

38:12.594 --> 38:13.963
Because

38:13.987 --> 38:15.443
Well, because

38:15.467 --> 38:17.096
you're the

38:17.120 --> 38:19.708
The all-knowing sage.

38:19.732 --> 38:22.232
That I am.

38:22.256 --> 38:25.714
But alas, I've resided
on this mountaintop

38:25.738 --> 38:29.674
for longer than you
two have been alive.

38:29.698 --> 38:32.460
I'm getting too old.

38:32.484 --> 38:36.009
My all-knowing
capabilities are waning.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.945
Well, could you
give us some advice?

38:39.969 --> 38:42.296
Advice, you say?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.601
Sure.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.474
Don't fly low in the mountains.

38:46.498 --> 38:49.390
Clean your claws daily.

38:49.414 --> 38:53.089
And stay away from
trapped-a-leery-con eggs.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.268
Thank you, sage.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.554
Might you have any advice for

39:01.295 --> 39:02.533
getting our king back?

39:02.557 --> 39:05.797
Regarding your problem
and the king's plight,

39:05.821 --> 39:10.609
there is one thing that can
reverse the Wyvern spell.

39:11.653 --> 39:12.543
There is!

39:12.567 --> 39:13.892
What is it?

39:13.916 --> 39:18.723
It's the Crystal Light
of the Mountain Pixies,

39:18.747 --> 39:21.857
but it's not easy to find.

39:21.881 --> 39:25.774
Convincing the Mountain
Pixies to help you will be

39:25.798 --> 39:30.169
more difficult than dealing
with me.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.694
I can assure you.

39:32.718 --> 39:34.522
That's okay, sir, thank you.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.654
We'll do everything we can.

39:36.678 --> 39:39.440
I see that you will, youngster.

39:39.464 --> 39:43.922
Go now, look out for
each other, and always

39:43.946 --> 39:48.734
remember we're all just
walking each other home.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.669
Wow!

39:51.693 --> 39:52.801
That's deep!

39:59.614 --> 40:02.419
Whatever will I do?

40:02.443 --> 40:04.010
The kingdom is doomed!

40:07.622 --> 40:11.646
Only if you allow
it to be doomed, king.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.474
What?

40:13.498 --> 40:15.563
Yeah, I get that a lot.

40:15.587 --> 40:18.435
What's the meaning
of this witchery?

40:18.459 --> 40:21.525
Take it easy, I
mean no harm to you.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.397
We're in the same boat.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.486
I too was a king once.

40:25.510 --> 40:28.663
In fact, we knew one
another, you and I.

40:28.687 --> 40:31.753
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

40:31.777 --> 40:34.756
I'm Sid the Mighty,
ex-Goblin king,

40:34.780 --> 40:39.543
before that monster, King
Foul, robbed me of my throne.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.066
King Sid!

40:41.090 --> 40:42.764
Great Scott!

40:42.788 --> 40:44.113
How did this happen?

40:44.137 --> 40:45.244
Who?

40:45.268 --> 40:47.159
Also, King Foul.

40:47.183 --> 40:51.207
I did not vacate my throne,
as was widely rumored.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.122
I was disposed of,

40:53.146 --> 40:57.082
and an evil spell
transformed me into this.

40:57.106 --> 41:01.173
From the ruler of my
land to a stick of wood.

41:01.197 --> 41:05.830
At least,
he let you remain yourself.

41:05.854 --> 41:06.875
I

41:06.899 --> 41:11.009
I had no idea, and
you've been here

41:11.033 --> 41:13.447
this whole time?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.361
Leaning in this corner.

41:15.385 --> 41:17.538
Watching spiders spin webs.

41:17.562 --> 41:20.192
Talking to prisoners
who are so crazy,

41:20.216 --> 41:23.282
they're used to talking
to inanimate objects.

41:23.306 --> 41:26.242
It's kind of refreshing to
have startled you, honestly.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.897
You haven't yet lost your mind.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.725
Nor shall I.

41:30.749 --> 41:33.423
I'm going to regain my kingdom!

41:33.447 --> 41:36.557
Somehow.

41:36.581 --> 41:39.908
Any ideas how?

41:39.932 --> 41:40.822
No.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.127
I see.

41:42.151 --> 41:45.653
How about you and I
make a bargain, king?

41:45.677 --> 41:49.178
What do either of us
have to offer the other?

41:49.202 --> 41:51.857
What sort of
bargain do you mean?

41:53.772 --> 41:55.924
I'll help you find
a way out of here,

41:55.948 --> 41:59.754
if you come back for me,
and help me defeat King Foul

41:59.778 --> 42:01.756
and retake my throne.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.584
Hmm.

42:03.608 --> 42:09.067
Anything, I can do to unseat
that monster?

42:09.091 --> 42:09.483
Count me in!

42:11.093 --> 42:16.074
Tell me, Sid, has anyone ever
broken out of this dungeon?

42:16.098 --> 42:17.598
Not that I know of.

42:17.622 --> 42:20.644
Then how do you
propose we do it,

42:20.668 --> 42:22.994
if it's never been done?

42:23.018 --> 42:25.867
Where there's a
will, there's a way!

42:25.891 --> 42:29.348
I suppose you're right.

42:29.372 --> 42:31.829
Besides, we've got
nothing but time.

42:31.853 --> 42:36.225
Chin up, king, dragons
and goblins never say die.

42:38.947 --> 42:41.143
I don't know about
these pixies, Boyle.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.101
I don't think I wanna
deal with anymore magic,

42:43.125 --> 42:44.494
if you know what I mean.

42:44.518 --> 42:46.104
But you heard the sage, Gurt.

42:46.128 --> 42:49.175
The pixies hold the secret to
reversing the Wyvern spell!

42:50.742 --> 42:53.764
And then can also probably
cast a nasty spell on us.

42:53.788 --> 42:56.419
If they don't like us,
maybe we should just

42:56.443 --> 42:58.029
leave them alone.

42:58.053 --> 42:59.944
We've come this far, Gurt.

42:59.968 --> 43:01.467
I'm not turning back now!

43:01.491 --> 43:03.165
You can go back now if you want.

43:03.189 --> 43:05.017
By myself, uh-uh!

43:05.931 --> 43:07.865
I'm sticking with you, Boyle.

43:07.889 --> 43:10.912
It's settled then, on we go!

43:13.242 --> 43:15.941
You can do this,
you can do this.

43:18.421 --> 43:21.183
Here it is, Tinker,
the Isle of Enchantment

43:21.207 --> 43:23.054
that Mold Spot told us about.

43:38.050 --> 43:39.462
Hello, hello there.

43:39.486 --> 43:41.986
What brings you, fine travelers,

43:42.010 --> 43:44.554
to the Isle of
Enchantment, today?

43:44.578 --> 43:46.774
We're here on
behalf of my father,

43:46.798 --> 43:49.603
who's in a dire emergency.

43:50.889 --> 43:51.996
Tragic.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.955
If you could please help us get

43:53.979 --> 43:57.828
to the land of the Mushroom
Elves, I'd be so grateful.

43:57.852 --> 44:00.831
Well, I might have helped
you out of the kindness

44:00.855 --> 44:03.617
of my heart, princess, but

44:03.641 --> 44:05.880
I don't have a heart.

44:05.904 --> 44:07.925
But I propose a test!

44:07.949 --> 44:11.233
Solve my riddle, and
I'll help you find

44:11.257 --> 44:15.280
the land of the Mushroom Elves.

44:15.304 --> 44:18.414
But fail and lose your way,

44:18.438 --> 44:23.027
both of you doomed to
wander this island forever.

44:25.837 --> 44:29.033
You're on, you aren't
smart enough to stump me,

44:29.057 --> 44:32.515
much less the both
of us, good sir.

44:32.539 --> 44:34.473
Tinker Toes!

44:34.497 --> 44:36.998
Go on, give us
your riddle, shill,

44:37.022 --> 44:40.784
and prepare to be
thwarted in short order.

44:40.808 --> 44:42.264
Argh!

44:42.288 --> 44:44.788
Very well, runt.

44:44.812 --> 44:46.268
Try this.

44:46.292 --> 44:50.011
All people have it,
rich people need it.

44:50.035 --> 44:53.797
If you eat it, you die.

44:54.996 --> 44:56.365
What is it?

44:56.389 --> 44:57.758
Oh my!

44:57.782 --> 44:59.673
Tinker, this is madness!

44:59.697 --> 45:02.240
My father's life is at stake!

45:02.264 --> 45:05.635
Trust me, princess,
this lad is nothing

45:05.659 --> 45:07.463
but a carny gatekeeper.

45:07.487 --> 45:08.270
Nothing.

45:09.576 --> 45:12.076
That's it!

45:12.100 --> 45:13.251
What's it?

45:13.275 --> 45:15.471
You said it, Tinker Toes!

45:15.495 --> 45:20.302
Nothing, poor people have
it, rich people need it.

45:20.326 --> 45:22.652
If you eat it, you die.

45:22.676 --> 45:24.088
What is it?

45:24.112 --> 45:26.003
Nothing!

45:26.027 --> 45:29.528
Well, you're smarter than
you look, I'll say that.

45:29.552 --> 45:31.182
Yay!

45:31.206 --> 45:32.749
Now, can you tell us how to get

45:32.773 --> 45:34.316
to the land of the
Mushroom Elves?

45:34.340 --> 45:36.666
A quarter of a mile that way,

45:36.690 --> 45:39.364
keep your eyes peeled,
then turn to your right,

45:39.388 --> 45:42.019
then left, and you're there.

45:42.043 --> 45:44.108
Let's go, Tinker Toes!

46:02.020 --> 46:03.562
Wow!

46:03.586 --> 46:04.849
Incredible.

46:08.461 --> 46:11.986
Welcome to the eternal
temple, travelers.

46:14.162 --> 46:16.556
I see you're both Wee Dragons.

46:17.513 --> 46:19.820
You must have come a long way.

46:21.866 --> 46:23.258
That we have, mister

46:25.043 --> 46:28.065
I'm Gruffydd, the pixie

46:28.089 --> 46:33.094
groundskeeper and temple-keeper
around here.

46:34.226 --> 46:38.162
Might I ask what brings
two young dragons,

46:38.186 --> 46:39.013
such as yourselves,

46:40.188 --> 46:42.819
to the eternal temple?

46:42.843 --> 46:44.516
I'm afraid it's not that fun.

46:44.540 --> 46:45.866
Our kingdom's in big trouble,

46:45.890 --> 46:48.520
and we've been all over,
trying to help our king,

46:48.544 --> 46:51.872
who's been held captive
by an evil spell!

46:51.896 --> 46:53.201
A spell?

46:54.289 --> 46:55.658
Let me cut to the chase.

46:55.682 --> 46:57.660
We've come to see
about the Crystal Light

46:57.684 --> 47:00.010
of the Mountain Pixies.

47:00.034 --> 47:01.098
Oh.

47:01.122 --> 47:03.472
I'm afraid you've
erred, dragons.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.650
The Crystal Light
won't be found here,

47:08.913 --> 47:12.414
nor is it a toy to
be trifled with.

47:12.438 --> 47:16.070
You should return
from whence you came,

47:16.094 --> 47:19.837
and forget all about
this journey of yours.

47:20.925 --> 47:22.380
Gruffydd, please hear us out!

47:22.404 --> 47:25.993
Everything thing we've
ever known will be lost,

47:26.017 --> 47:27.603
if we don't stop this Wee Dragon

47:27.627 --> 47:29.866
who cast the evil
spell on our king!

47:29.890 --> 47:32.869
If I take you to
see the Pixie King,

47:32.893 --> 47:35.243
and he dislikes what he hears,

47:37.289 --> 47:41.617
he may throw you in the pixie
pit of piercing pantaloons

47:41.641 --> 47:43.643
for all eternity.

47:44.949 --> 47:49.083
Then your bad day will
become a horrible end.

47:51.259 --> 47:54.045
Do you two youngster
want to risk that?

47:54.959 --> 47:55.785
Yes!
No!

47:57.004 --> 47:58.982
I mean, I suppose.

47:59.006 --> 48:02.246
This place has always
been shabby, Durwin,

48:02.270 --> 48:04.031
but I've got plans.

48:04.055 --> 48:07.948
With us in power, this
area will be transformed

48:07.972 --> 48:11.299
into a dragon discotheque.

48:11.323 --> 48:12.343
Ahem.

48:12.367 --> 48:14.041
Do you think you
might be getting

48:14.065 --> 48:16.304
ahead of yourself, Blister?

48:16.328 --> 48:17.895
What's that supposed to mean?

48:19.113 --> 48:22.136
Just that you're making
quite a few big plans,

48:22.160 --> 48:26.444
but you haven't yet assumed
full control of the kingdom.

48:26.468 --> 48:30.318
You could still be thwarted
by dedicated opponents.

48:30.342 --> 48:31.797
Oh, really?

48:31.821 --> 48:34.626
I'd like to see these
opponents, Durwin.

48:34.650 --> 48:38.500
Tell me, where might
they be hiding, hmm?

48:38.524 --> 48:41.982
Just presenting the
possibility, that's all.

48:42.006 --> 48:45.202
I've been around a
long time, remember?

48:45.226 --> 48:49.100
I've seen kings comes,
and I've seen kings go.

48:50.362 --> 48:52.862
Well, you've never
seen a king like me,

48:52.886 --> 48:54.690
King Blister the First.

48:54.714 --> 48:57.127
As your dedicated
cohort, Blister,

48:57.151 --> 49:00.261
I must tell you that
there is a power greater

49:00.285 --> 49:01.764
than that which you possess.

49:03.244 --> 49:04.830
Ha, boulder dash!

49:04.854 --> 49:08.423
Name this power, and I'll find
it and make it my own, too!

49:09.990 --> 49:13.056
The Crystal Light of the
Mountain Pixies can reverse

49:13.080 --> 49:16.277
your Wyvern spell,
and any other spell

49:16.301 --> 49:18.453
you might cast, for that matter.

49:18.477 --> 49:21.717
Then the Pixie
King will also fall,

49:21.741 --> 49:24.154
and that kingdom
shall be mine as well!

49:24.178 --> 49:26.113
And with it, the Crystal Light

49:26.137 --> 49:28.158
of the former Mountain Pixies.

49:32.752 --> 49:34.599
This place is scary, Boyle.

49:34.623 --> 49:37.776
Are you sure Gruffydd brought
us to the right place?

49:37.800 --> 49:39.996
We're in no position
to question him, Gurt.

49:40.020 --> 49:41.389
And we're running out of time!

49:41.413 --> 49:42.588
We have to have faith!

49:44.285 --> 49:46.960
Stop there, you are
strange creatures!

49:48.072 --> 49:49.353
Who said that?

49:49.377 --> 49:50.833
I got this, Gurt!

49:50.857 --> 49:53.183
Greetings, pixie, we were
brought here by Gruffydd,

49:53.207 --> 49:55.403
to see your king!

49:55.427 --> 49:58.580
I know who brought you
and I know why you're here,

49:58.604 --> 50:01.496
but do you really believe
you can just march in

50:01.520 --> 50:03.130
and command the king's ear?

50:04.262 --> 50:05.393
Well.

50:06.264 --> 50:08.242
It's worked pretty well, so far.

50:08.266 --> 50:10.853
Sh, Gurt, don't make him mad!

50:10.877 --> 50:12.898
If it's the king
you wish to meet,

50:12.922 --> 50:14.813
you'll be granted
court with the king

50:14.837 --> 50:17.773
of the Mountain
Pixies, do you accept?

50:17.797 --> 50:19.470
Sounds like we
don't have a choice.

50:19.494 --> 50:20.776
You don't.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.386
Then let's do this!

50:32.290 --> 50:34.181
Well, well, well!

50:35.249 --> 50:36.381
What do we have here?

50:38.687 --> 50:43.103
A pretty lady and some
kind of grizzly creature?

50:43.127 --> 50:45.322
Hey, watch your mouth!

50:45.346 --> 50:49.979
I am Princess Cai, from the
kingdom of the Wee Dragons.

50:50.003 --> 50:50.849
Oh.

50:50.873 --> 50:53.591
Oh, wow, you are her.

50:53.615 --> 50:55.400
I wasn't expecting

50:57.010 --> 50:59.423
please accept my apology
for my behavior, princess.

50:59.447 --> 51:02.252
I'm not used to royalty
strolling in here

51:02.276 --> 51:03.862
out of the blue and all.

51:03.886 --> 51:06.778
Huh, fat chance, door man.

51:06.802 --> 51:09.303
Tinker Toes, please!

51:09.327 --> 51:12.262
Long Snot, I'm afraid
our visit is a matter

51:12.286 --> 51:14.134
of life and death.

51:14.158 --> 51:16.484
My kingdom is in great peril,

51:16.508 --> 51:20.096
and my father the king
has been kidnapped.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.663
Oh no!

51:21.687 --> 51:25.145
I've followed King Bedwyr's
monarchy since I was little.

51:26.431 --> 51:28.476
I even remember when
you were born, princess.

51:30.174 --> 51:33.936
I must warn you it may not be
the best time to see the king.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.720
He's in a

51:35.744 --> 51:39.463
a particularly foul mood.

51:39.487 --> 51:41.770
Long Snot, I know a princess

51:41.794 --> 51:44.338
of the Wee Dragons
means nothing here,

51:44.362 --> 51:47.167
but we're trying
to save my kingdom.

51:47.191 --> 51:50.518
If there's any way we can
plead our case to the king,

51:50.542 --> 51:53.129
we'd be forever in your debt.

51:53.153 --> 51:54.241
Who can argue that?

51:55.677 --> 51:58.482
You're even more impressive
in person,

51:58.506 --> 52:00.571
Than the stories
I've heard about you.

52:00.595 --> 52:03.400
There are stories about me?

52:03.424 --> 52:06.360
Oh yeah, you're widely admired.

52:06.384 --> 52:09.493
And not just in
your own kingdom.

52:09.517 --> 52:13.193
Oh my!

52:13.217 --> 52:14.348
I told you so.

52:15.219 --> 52:16.045
This way!

52:25.054 --> 52:28.208
I have big plans
for this dump, Durwin.

52:28.232 --> 52:31.820
And I'm not about to let
anything get in my way now!

52:31.844 --> 52:33.909
If there's a stupid
light out there

52:33.933 --> 52:36.999
that can undo my
spells, I want it.

52:37.023 --> 52:39.436
Right here, in the
palm of my paw.

52:39.460 --> 52:43.919
No weapons shall exist that
aren't controlled by me.

52:43.943 --> 52:47.836
And no one shall harbor any
secrets across this land

52:47.860 --> 52:49.838
that I don't know about.

52:49.862 --> 52:53.929
Starting right now, there's
a new sheriff in town.

52:55.607 --> 52:58.803
Wouldn't you rather be king?

52:58.827 --> 53:01.589
I am king, it's a saying.

53:01.613 --> 53:03.112
You know what I mean.

53:03.136 --> 53:06.550
Go forth, mighty Durwin, and
bring me the Crystal Light

53:06.574 --> 53:08.030
of the Mountain Pixies.

53:31.425 --> 53:32.837
Forgive the intrusion, king,

53:32.861 --> 53:34.404
but we've had a long day,

53:34.428 --> 53:36.014
and we won't waste
a lot of your time.

53:36.038 --> 53:38.930
My name's Boyle and this here
is my companion, Big Gurt.

53:38.954 --> 53:41.455
We're from the fun and friendly
kingdom of the Wee Dragons,

53:41.479 --> 53:42.978
and it's in a lot of trouble.

53:43.002 --> 53:45.502
Our King Bedwyr the
Tremendous has fallen victim

53:45.526 --> 53:47.504
to an evil spell,
and has been replaced

53:47.528 --> 53:50.725
by a nasty, little runt
of a dragon named Blister.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.074
You may have heard of him.

53:52.098 --> 53:54.598
If not, you're not
missing anything.

53:54.622 --> 53:57.079
Yeah, nothing at all.

53:57.103 --> 53:58.515
We've been told that the spell

53:58.539 --> 54:00.778
that overthrew our
king can be reversed

54:00.802 --> 54:03.346
by the magical Crystal Light
of the Mountain Pixies.

54:03.370 --> 54:06.001
So, long story
short, here we are.

54:06.025 --> 54:09.526
Humbly throwing ourselves
at your mercy, Pixie King.

54:09.550 --> 54:11.615
Yes, humbly, very humbly.

54:11.639 --> 54:14.488
All we want is to save
our kingdom, our families,

54:14.512 --> 54:15.750
and our friends, king.

54:15.774 --> 54:17.621
And our travels
have led us to you.

54:17.645 --> 54:19.580
If you could help us, we

54:19.604 --> 54:21.930
We'll be your friends for life.

54:21.954 --> 54:25.194
Unless that's weird,

54:25.218 --> 54:27.370
Then we'd leave you alone.

54:27.394 --> 54:28.937
Unless you needed us.

54:28.961 --> 54:32.462
Unless you needed us,
then, yeah, we'd be there.

54:32.486 --> 54:34.638
If you needed anything.

54:34.662 --> 54:35.944
Anything at all.

54:35.968 --> 54:38.903
We heard you might
be in a bad mood, so

54:38.927 --> 54:40.688
again we apologize.

54:40.712 --> 54:41.495
Enough!

54:45.673 --> 54:49.566
You heard right, Wee Dragons,
I'm in a bad mood today!

54:49.590 --> 54:53.483
A bad mood, because I heard
what happened in your kingdom.

54:53.507 --> 54:56.530
And in my experience, a
usurer to a throne will

54:56.554 --> 54:59.489
not stop with a
single kingdom, so

54:59.513 --> 55:02.579
unfortunately I'm
anticipating widespread war

55:02.603 --> 55:05.539
and destabilization,
across all our lands,

55:05.563 --> 55:07.671
far and wide,

55:07.695 --> 55:13.503
unless your wee problem-child,
Blister, is stopped now!

55:13.527 --> 55:15.679
So, we're on the same page?

55:15.703 --> 55:16.854
That's great!

55:16.878 --> 55:18.508
Yeah!

55:18.532 --> 55:21.685
Wee Dragons, there comes a
time in every creatures life

55:21.709 --> 55:25.080
when one must venture forth
and test one's mettle,

55:25.104 --> 55:26.821
against the world at large.

55:26.845 --> 55:28.388
What's that mean?

55:28.412 --> 55:30.651
Sh, be quiet, Gurt!

55:30.675 --> 55:35.395
These journeys bring us
closer to our true selves,

55:35.419 --> 55:38.441
and by undertaking
them, unlock within us

55:38.465 --> 55:40.661
the latent strength and magic

55:40.685 --> 55:43.644
that lay dormant
in us, all along.

55:45.080 --> 55:46.667
Oh seriously, I'm totally lost.

55:46.691 --> 55:49.365
Gurt, hush!

55:49.389 --> 55:52.542
You Wees have undoubtedly
traversed much treachery

55:52.566 --> 55:57.417
on your path to me, and cleared
many unforeseen hurdles.

55:57.441 --> 55:58.679
True that!

55:58.703 --> 56:01.203
What, I know what
he's saying now!

56:01.227 --> 56:03.466
You've come seeking the
heralded Crystal Light

56:03.490 --> 56:05.729
of the Mountain Pixies?

56:05.753 --> 56:07.731
Yep, that's the thing!

56:07.755 --> 56:12.499
Well, let me tell you,
there's no such thing.

56:15.894 --> 56:17.437
What do you mean?

56:17.461 --> 56:20.048
The Crystal Light is a myth,

56:20.072 --> 56:23.573
a rumor started to
dissuade any attackers

56:23.597 --> 56:27.447
and discourage any
attempts to overthrow me.

56:27.471 --> 56:28.578
Really?

56:28.602 --> 56:30.798
Really, and it's worked great.

56:30.822 --> 56:35.106
Obviously, you risked your
very lives chasing after it.

56:35.130 --> 56:37.413
Boy, do I feel stupid.

56:37.437 --> 56:38.980
Me too.

56:39.004 --> 56:42.897
I mean, I feel that way a
lot, but especially right now.

56:42.921 --> 56:46.640
Feel not self-pity, Wee Dragons.

56:46.664 --> 56:49.033
Instead, feel gratitude.

56:49.057 --> 56:51.601
The lessons learned
in your travels

56:51.625 --> 56:55.475
have opened an important
door, for you both.

56:55.499 --> 56:56.998
Now, I'm confused.

56:57.022 --> 57:00.523
We just failed our king and
our land is lost forever.

57:00.547 --> 57:02.786
Forgive me, Pixie King,
but I'm not really feeling

57:02.810 --> 57:04.571
this personal growth
thing, at all.

57:04.595 --> 57:08.444
Young dragon, sometimes
the answers we need most

57:08.468 --> 57:12.753
also reveal themselves
when they are most needed.

57:12.777 --> 57:15.103
You are dragons,

57:15.127 --> 57:17.695
therefore inherently magical.

57:18.913 --> 57:21.631
The power you seek
is already with you!

57:23.788 --> 57:25.243
King, king!

57:25.267 --> 57:26.810
A high alert!

57:26.834 --> 57:29.334
Our scouts have spotted the
mighty dragon Durwin in flight.

57:29.358 --> 57:30.771
He's headed straight for us.

57:30.795 --> 57:33.817
Clear the grounds and
lock down the castle!

57:33.841 --> 57:35.689
Farewell, Wee Dragons.

57:35.713 --> 57:39.388
Remember my words and
good luck on your mission.

57:39.412 --> 57:43.111
It is not over until
you wish it to be!

57:57.299 --> 58:01.236
Oh, Gurt, I don't
what to do now.

58:01.260 --> 58:02.783
There's no where else to turn.

58:04.132 --> 58:06.676
Maybe, we don't
need to turn anywhere.

58:06.700 --> 58:08.765
You heard what the
Pixie King said,

58:08.789 --> 58:10.941
the answer to saving
our kingdom is

58:10.965 --> 58:13.640
already inside of us.

58:13.664 --> 58:17.034
But what does that mean?

58:17.058 --> 58:21.299
It means we go save
King Bedwyr ourselves!

58:27.199 --> 58:29.960
Princess Cai of the
kingdom of the Wee Dragons,

58:29.984 --> 58:34.748
and her companion Tinker
Toes, to see you, great king.

58:34.772 --> 58:36.706
Approach.

58:36.730 --> 58:38.795
Good luck, princess.

58:38.819 --> 58:40.667
Good day, king.

58:40.691 --> 58:44.956
What brings you all the
way to my land, princess?

58:46.871 --> 58:49.787
A big problem, actually.

58:50.831 --> 58:52.417
Oh?

58:52.441 --> 58:56.117
My father, King Bedwyr,
has been overthrown

58:56.141 --> 58:59.555
and is being held captive
in the Goblin kingdom.

58:59.579 --> 59:02.515
Yes, I said rumor of this,

59:02.539 --> 59:05.082
so it's true?

59:05.106 --> 59:07.345
Sadly, yes.

59:07.369 --> 59:08.869
Hmm.

59:08.893 --> 59:12.133
Well, what do you want from me?

59:12.157 --> 59:14.788
I want you to help me
into the Goblin kingdom,

59:14.812 --> 59:17.355
so I can bring my father back.

59:19.164 --> 59:23.037
I respect your
determination, princess, but

59:24.169 --> 59:28.628
such a thing is unheard of.

59:28.652 --> 59:32.240
Respectfully, king,
if I may interject.

59:32.264 --> 59:34.590
Unheard of things are
happening all the time,

59:34.614 --> 59:36.070
unheard of things
toppled our king,

59:36.094 --> 59:39.421
and unheard of things
will also rescue him.

59:39.445 --> 59:42.642
We're here to do
unheard of things.

59:42.666 --> 59:46.994
And what will you
give me in return,

59:47.018 --> 59:49.344
Wee Dragons?

59:49.368 --> 59:52.782
How about we bring
back your gold?

59:52.806 --> 59:53.851
Hmm.

59:55.026 --> 59:57.831
Now, you're talking, creatures!

59:57.855 --> 01:00:02.381
I will allow you into the
kingdom of the Goblins.

01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:06.535
King Bedwyr, my sixth
sense tells me your daughter,

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:10.017
Princess Cai, has just
breached the Goblin kingdom!

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:11.540
What?

01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:14.282
She's here, king, and she
has a companion with her,

01:00:14.306 --> 01:00:16.414
a small, Runtish creature.

01:00:16.438 --> 01:00:18.982
I don't know the name,
but it doesn't appear

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:22.899
to offer much protection in
the face of grave danger.

01:00:22.923 --> 01:00:24.161
Tinker Toes!

01:00:24.185 --> 01:00:27.556
Can you see exactly
where they are now, Sid?

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.037
No, only that they're here.

01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:31.778
They're on the move and.

01:00:31.802 --> 01:00:33.954
And what, what?

01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:36.347
And their demise is certain.

01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:38.480
She shouldn't have come, king.

01:00:38.504 --> 01:00:40.177
She shouldn't have come.

01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:55.434
Hello,

01:00:56.522 --> 01:00:58.369
princess.

01:00:58.393 --> 01:01:03.113
Nice to you save me the
trouble of coming for you,

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:06.880
and came to me instead.

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:12.079
I came for one thing, King Foul,

01:01:12.103 --> 01:01:16.039
my father, the rightful
king of the Wee Dragons.

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:21.088
Ah, but the king of
your land is King Blister.

01:01:21.112 --> 01:01:24.961
Check the castle if
you don't believe me.

01:01:24.985 --> 01:01:28.748
The only thing that needs
checking is your mouth,

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.599
you despicable creep!

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.579
No, my princess.

01:01:34.603 --> 01:01:37.408
The only thing that
needs checking is

01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:40.890
where our wedding
will take place,

01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:45.049
your kingdom or mine.

01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:47.723
Wedding?

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:50.030
You really are crazy!

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:52.143
Crazy in love!

01:01:53.492 --> 01:01:56.800
Come now, let's get hitched!

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:58.976
How about I turn you into

01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:01.065
a donkey!

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:08.135
Hmm.

01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:12.163
You'll have to work on
that magic, princess.

01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:16.186
How about a hug instead?

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:25.500
Maybe, you're right, Gurt.

01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:27.894
Maybe, we can do
this on our own.

01:02:27.918 --> 01:02:29.809
We were looking
for help all along,

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:33.290
and all along we had
everything we needed!

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:35.162
Thank the Pixie King, Boyle.

01:02:35.186 --> 01:02:36.467
I mean, let's face it.

01:02:36.491 --> 01:02:38.537
I never thought we'd get
half as far as we did.

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:50.743
Wee Dragons, bah!

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.224
Hypnotized dragons, double bah!

01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:03.997
What?

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:06.759
Howdy, Boyle.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:07.977
Hey, Gurt.

01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:10.850
Boyle, what did you just do?

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:13.069
I think I just conjured
the Crystal Light

01:03:13.093 --> 01:03:15.115
of the Mountian Pixies!

01:03:15.139 --> 01:03:16.575
What are you guys up to?

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:18.707
You

01:03:20.144 --> 01:03:21.686
don't remember?

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:24.777
Remember what, exactly.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.691
Oh, nothing.

01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:27.997
Say, Durwin

01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:29.433
If you're not too busy,

01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:31.522
we're gonna run a little errand.

01:03:31.546 --> 01:03:33.046
You wanna help us?

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:34.221
Woo-hoo!

01:03:34.245 --> 01:03:37.093
We got ourselves a
mighty dragon ally!

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:39.792
Our work on my magic, all right.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.229
I'd sooner groom a hairless cat

01:03:42.253 --> 01:03:44.579
than ever kiss a dirty rat!

01:03:44.603 --> 01:03:48.912
This is for my father,
King Bedwyr the Tremendous!

01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:56.939
Now, that's impressive.

01:03:56.963 --> 01:03:59.115
Amazing job, princess!

01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:00.987
I couldn't have done it better.

01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:04.207
Come on, Tinker Toes,
we have a king to rescue.

01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:12.172
Cai!

01:04:12.196 --> 01:04:14.087
Daddy!

01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:18.482
Oh, however did
you find me, my dear?

01:04:18.506 --> 01:04:20.484
We never gave up, daddy.

01:04:20.508 --> 01:04:23.183
We kept looking
until we found you!

01:04:23.207 --> 01:04:25.925
How in the world
did you get past

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:29.102
that scoundrel, King Foul?

01:04:29.126 --> 01:04:30.755
Magic, my king.

01:04:30.779 --> 01:04:33.149
I found my magic!

01:04:33.173 --> 01:04:36.892
I was wondering
when you would realize

01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:39.982
your full capabilities.

01:04:40.006 --> 01:04:43.116
We all find it at
different times.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:47.511
You were born a
dragon princess, Cai,

01:04:47.535 --> 01:04:51.776
and now is the time
to live as one.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.127
I won't let you
down again, daddy.

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:56.520
I'll never let you down.

01:04:56.544 --> 01:04:57.782
I

01:04:57.806 --> 01:05:00.481
You never let me
down to begin with.

01:05:00.505 --> 01:05:03.614
I've never been
more proud of you.

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:06.337
You're the best princess
in the entire world.

01:05:08.252 --> 01:05:10.099
And you're the
best king the land

01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:12.710
of the Wee Dragons
has ever known.

01:05:14.432 --> 01:05:16.149
Stay on your toes, guys.

01:05:16.173 --> 01:05:19.195
When we find Blister,
he won't go quietly!

01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:20.544
He never does.

01:05:20.568 --> 01:05:23.286
I sure am looking
forward to some rest

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:25.201
and relaxation after this.

01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:29.336
I've seen an awful lot of
action, for a sleepy dragon.

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:37.344
Ha, you can say that again!

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:40.913
He's seen an awful lot of
action for a sleepy dragon?

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:43.393
Hey, where did Durwin go?

01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:44.766
He's right next to me.

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.311
Hey, where did he go?

01:05:52.513 --> 01:05:56.363
Nice try, wee jerks,
but my Wyvern spell is

01:05:56.387 --> 01:06:00.933
more powerful than any
peddling magic you control.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.499
You sure about that, Blister?

01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:07.137
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:12.248
Have it your way!

01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:14.163
Ha, what do you call that?

01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:15.164
Yoga?

01:06:15.188 --> 01:06:16.818
Go find a wishing well.

01:06:16.842 --> 01:06:18.646
Durwin, attack!

01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:24.850
Durwin, attack!

01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:31.224
Your party's over, Blister.

01:06:31.248 --> 01:06:33.922
It's time to pay
the consequences.

01:06:35.165 --> 01:06:37.621
Why don't we talk
about this, eh?

01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:39.797
Maybe, next time, Blister.

01:06:39.821 --> 01:06:43.236
Right now, I have
a princess to see.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:45.368
Off you go, wee jerk,

01:06:45.392 --> 01:06:48.023
to a land far, far away.

01:07:01.713 --> 01:07:05.736
If not for the
bravery of you two Wees,

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:09.827
our kingdom may
not have survived.

01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:11.090
Boyle,

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.352
Gurt,

01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:15.790
on behalf of the
entire Wee kingdom,

01:07:15.814 --> 01:07:18.967
I want to thank you.

01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:20.925
Anything you want,

01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:23.754
you just name it.

01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:29.891
Your majesty, with your
daughter's quick thinking,

01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:32.459
unbelievable strength, and
bravery anything greater

01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:34.374
than anything we
could've mustered,

01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:36.332
we couldn't have gotten
as far as we did.

01:07:36.356 --> 01:07:37.942
I appreciate the kind words

01:07:37.966 --> 01:07:40.684
and will carry them
with me forever, but

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:45.713
the only reward I dare ask is
for Cai's hand in marriage.

01:07:47.976 --> 01:07:51.782
Princess Cai, will you marry me?

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:54.568
Adventure and love!

01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:58.204
Yes, yes, I will
marry you, Boyle!

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:04.404
I didn't know how to tell
you before, but

01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:05.579
I've been in love with you

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:08.669
since I first set
eyes on you, Cai.

01:08:08.693 --> 01:08:11.367
Oh stop!

01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:13.978
I'm serious, you made
my heart pitter-patter

01:08:14.002 --> 01:08:16.416
every time I caught
a glimpse of you.

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:18.765
I never could figure
out how to break the ice

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:21.464
and just introduce myself.

01:08:21.488 --> 01:08:25.685
Silly dragon, all you
had to do was say, hi.

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:27.557
I don't bite.

01:08:27.581 --> 01:08:30.473
I know you yearn for
travel and adventure, Cai.

01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:31.779
And I want you to know,

01:08:31.803 --> 01:08:34.825
I'll always be game for
any adventure you want,

01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:36.957
on one condition.

01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:39.462
Oh, what condition is that?

01:08:40.377 --> 01:08:43.703
Always take me with you.

01:08:43.728 --> 01:08:45.053
Deal!

01:08:45.077 --> 01:08:46.402
I love you, Boyle.
