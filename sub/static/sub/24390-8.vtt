- Hey, that's a great--

21:16.767 --> 21:18.567

a koozie with that.

21:18.567 --> 21:20.367
- I'm gonna make
a coffee mug about it.

21:22.567 --> 21:24.233
- There's a town,

21:24.233 --> 21:26.734
we're getting ready
to drive through, Ravenel.

21:26.734 --> 21:28.633
Right here.

21:28.633 --> 21:31.400
- No, I don't own it.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.600
I would have the perfect name
if I married you.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.233
- Ashley Ravenel.

21:37.233 --> 21:39.066
I love you.

21:39.066 --> 21:40.600
I really do love you.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
Sometimes you drive me crazy.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.533

21:44.533 --> 21:47.100

doesn't it?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.633
Apparently.

21:50.633 --> 21:53.233

you just stick up for me

to your son's birthday party.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.367
Okay?

21:59.367 --> 22:02.266
And, who knows,
maybe she will invite me.

22:02.266 --> 22:04.266

22:04.266 --> 22:05.667
- Thomas.

22:05.667 --> 22:09.467
Of course we can.
Yes.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.266
So, how much longer
do we have until

22:11.266 --> 22:14.000
we're all under the same roof?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.734
- So, it's just
us four girls and Ashley?

22:18.266 --> 22:20.233
- Yeah.

22:20.233 --> 22:22.400
Is that right?

on the island yet.

22:43.367 --> 22:45.100
- Oh my gosh, it's an island
we're going to?

22:45.100 --> 22:48.166
- Yeah, it's called
Hilton Head Island.

22:48.166 --> 22:51.166

22:51.166 --> 22:52.567

22:58.166 --> 22:59.266

22:59.266 --> 23:00.734
There's something just idyllic

23:00.734 --> 23:02.333

were still together.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.066
- Okay, so we're, like,
here almost?

23:18.066 --> 23:21.266

a slow paced, river town.

23:21.266 --> 23:24.166
It's so developed now.
This was nothing but like--

23:24.166 --> 23:26.266
looked like that, just woods.

I think because
I grew up in the country,

laid-back attitude.

- So...

30:45.100 --> 30:49.367
- Well, they are yours, so...
- They're not.

30:51.033 --> 30:54.667

thought it was gonna go, at all.

30:54.667 --> 30:56.567

'cause I know you're
always short on 'em but--

31:01.033 --> 31:03.433

How am I supposed to know
it's just a case?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.533

the delivered one--

31:06.533 --> 31:08.100
it's 1-800-contacts.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.567
I guarantee that
there's contacts in there.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.300

contacts in there.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.600
You get contacts in,
like, a prescription box

31:14.600 --> 31:16.200
but I guess
you don't know that.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.200

zero interest in.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.133
- It's not a big deal.
I was just trying to be nice.

31:21.133 --> 31:22.467
- He's like a dopey dog.

31:22.467 --> 31:25.300
- It's so hard to, like,
not love him though.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.467
- But, I mean,
every single time

31:27.467 --> 31:29.200
they get together, they fight.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.133
And then the next time they see
each other they hug it out

31:31.133 --> 31:34.734
and then they fight.
- Yeah.

31:34.734 --> 31:36.600
- Well, I'm glad
that's not our problem.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.233

sailboats out to people

like, family and friends.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.100
- I'm gonna kill you right now.

40:23.767 --> 40:26.100

I just want to know
if it's something

40:44.100 --> 40:46.633
that I'm included in or I'm not.

40:46.633 --> 40:48.433
I mean, you can't just
say it to my face?

40:48.433 --> 40:50.734
Why?

40:50.734 --> 40:52.200
- Because I don't understand
why it's not

40:52.200 --> 40:53.367
a question
that can be answered.

40:53.367 --> 40:55.300
Am I invited
or am I not invited?

40:55.300 --> 40:56.500
Yes or no?

40:58.500 --> 41:01.133

a conversation for the table,

41:01.133 --> 41:02.133

learn to get it

41:09.333 --> 41:11.266
if you're gonna be around.
- I won't.

41:11.266 --> 41:14.100
What's going on?

41:14.100 --> 41:16.000

to something right now

41:16.000 --> 41:17.400

to me that way?

41:19.667 --> 41:21.500

anywhere, so get used to me.

41:37.133 --> 41:38.533
