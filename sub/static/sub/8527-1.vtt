WEBVTT

01:27.480 --> 01:30.907
<i>"We danced our youth
in a dreamed-of city</i>

01:32.610 --> 01:33.804
<i>Venice</i>

01:34.044 --> 01:36.444
<i>Paradise proud and pretty</i>

01:45.789 --> 01:48.986
<i>We lived for love and lust and beauty</i>

01:49.193 --> 01:51.559
<i>Pleasure then our only duty</i>

02:03.474 --> 02:06.102
<i>Floating then 'twixt heaven and earth</i>

02:06.310 --> 02:08.972
<i>And drunk on plenty's blessed mirth</i>

02:21.358 --> 02:23.918
<i>We thought ourselves eternal then</i>

02:24.161 --> 02:26.925
<i>Our glory sealed by God's own pen</i>

02:35.005 --> 02:37.769
<i>But paradise we found is always frail</i>

02:40.444 --> 02:43.345
<i>Against man's fear will always fail. "</i>

03:02.032 --> 03:03.761
Is anything wrong, Mama?

03:04.301 --> 03:05.700
Nothing at all.

03:23.854 --> 03:25.185
I feel faint.

03:25.556 --> 03:27.023
I feel faint.

03:29.660 --> 03:30.820
I feel faint.

03:36.734 --> 03:37.928
What are you doing?

03:38.168 --> 03:39.692
Come on, Beatrice.

03:41.905 --> 03:42.997
Quick!

03:47.878 --> 03:49.345
Slow down!

03:51.682 --> 03:52.706
Veronica!

04:12.636 --> 04:13.261
Look!

04:13.704 --> 04:14.762
Hello!

04:14.905 --> 04:15.929
Your brother!

04:16.173 --> 04:17.902
Hello, Venice!

04:18.275 --> 04:19.742
What if he sees us?

04:19.977 --> 04:22.172
He's looking at them, not us.

04:22.379 --> 04:24.643
Hello, Venice!

04:25.449 --> 04:26.973
Did you get my letters?

04:27.217 --> 04:30.186
No? I'm not talking to you anyway.
You broke my heart.

04:30.521 --> 04:31.783
Come on!

04:39.196 --> 04:40.527
Come on!

04:46.804 --> 04:48.294
All this for me?

04:53.377 --> 04:54.844
Oh Olivia

04:55.112 --> 04:56.238
Oh glorious maid

04:56.547 --> 04:57.809
Of virtue spare

04:58.015 --> 05:00.006
With bosoms like those who could care?

05:02.152 --> 05:03.278
My rod...

05:03.587 --> 05:05.555
...my lady, a hand.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.256
- Come.
- Hardly.

05:17.267 --> 05:19.792
It's Venus, come to bless the Venetians!

05:35.886 --> 05:37.148
You smell like a sewer.

05:37.354 --> 05:41.017
Thank you. That's a fine welcome,
little sister. Look at you.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.919
You might make a wife after all.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.491
- Did you see him?
- Who?

05:47.764 --> 05:48.924
Is he handsome?

05:52.202 --> 05:54.033
- He's powerful.
- He is.

06:02.846 --> 06:04.404
Welcome home, Marco.

06:13.724 --> 06:15.191
I think I've missed you.

06:15.659 --> 06:17.786
With all the court ladies to amuse you?

06:18.028 --> 06:21.259
Roman women, they can't hold a candle
to the Venetian.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.332
Nor can French, Florentine
nor any from Europe to the Levant.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.667
No doubt you've sampled them all.

06:27.871 --> 06:30.237
All but idle amusement
until you blossomed.

06:31.508 --> 06:33.976
What keeps a son
from greeting his own parents?

06:34.244 --> 06:36.041
Beauty, I think.

06:38.749 --> 06:41.809
You're drenched. Come on,
you'll catch your death.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.925
I thought you were going
to miss dinner again.

06:50.127 --> 06:53.460
Ladies have better things to do
than poison their minds with books.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.392
Such as?

06:54.898 --> 06:57.230
Such as minding their manners.

06:57.434 --> 06:59.402
The butcher said he must be paid.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.331
Sera, do you know when you sail?

07:01.538 --> 07:02.732
Next week.

07:02.906 --> 07:04.635
Wish I could sail the high seas.

07:05.075 --> 07:07.236
Veronica, high seas, indeed.

07:08.211 --> 07:10.907
She'll never find a husband
if she carries on like a child.

07:14.551 --> 07:16.849
How do people marry, Mother?

07:17.921 --> 07:19.616
They strike a bargain.

07:20.757 --> 07:22.725
What's to bargain over
if you're in love?

07:23.026 --> 07:26.223
Marriage is a contract,
not a perpetual tryst.

07:26.496 --> 07:28.555
Have you got someone in mind?

07:37.641 --> 07:39.700
- Love poetry?
- Give it back!

07:39.876 --> 07:41.901
"Life's harshness all forgave

07:42.112 --> 07:44.478
Hearts yearning met
When God...

07:45.248 --> 07:46.476
...your soul did..."

07:51.955 --> 07:53.752
Must be true love.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.953
I'd have made a dashing courtier.

08:01.965 --> 08:03.865
Or maybe a pirate!

08:06.036 --> 08:06.798
Disengage.

08:07.137 --> 08:10.334
And again, back.
Back, extend and lunge.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.671
<i>Nor in hope</i>

08:18.548 --> 08:20.948
<i>The world can show a fatal...</i>

08:21.218 --> 08:23.186
<i>... love for me</i>

08:23.420 --> 08:25.445
<i>But since that I must...</i>

08:25.689 --> 08:29.989
<i>I really love you
Please won't you love me</i>

08:45.609 --> 08:47.474
And where might you be going?

08:48.779 --> 08:49.939
Nowhere.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.313
That 'nowhere' has a nice tenor.

09:08.432 --> 09:11.560
Veronica is on the canal
with Marco Venier. Alone.

09:12.569 --> 09:14.161
Mother Franco!

09:14.404 --> 09:18.170
Elena, don't call me that.
Makes me feel ancient.

09:18.408 --> 09:21.673
Young ladies of marriageable age
must be chaperoned.

09:21.912 --> 09:25.006
A good marriage for Veronica
could win me a proper commission.

09:25.215 --> 09:26.477
I always liked Marco.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.547
He won't marry her
if he's had her.

09:28.752 --> 09:32.244
Marry her? A bride of Marco's
will need a king's ransom.

09:36.726 --> 09:40.218
"I see my fated stars
Your eyes...

09:41.098 --> 09:44.192
They melt me as the sun does snow"

09:50.006 --> 09:51.837
I bought this in Rome for you.

09:55.445 --> 09:56.776
You didn't buy it for me.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.038
Yes, I did.

09:58.381 --> 09:59.473
I just didn't know it.

10:04.054 --> 10:06.852
Such an easy gift might easily
be taken back again.

10:09.559 --> 10:11.527
Then name me any other gift.

10:12.929 --> 10:14.590
The book will do for now.

10:15.966 --> 10:18.093
I think perhaps you're too young...

10:18.535 --> 10:20.196
...to accept what I would...

10:20.437 --> 10:21.597
...truly give you.

10:22.606 --> 10:26.474
I am not so young
as you are vain.

10:28.245 --> 10:29.803
You haven't changed, have you?

10:31.615 --> 10:32.809
How would you know?

10:46.563 --> 10:50.192
I fear you mistake me for
one of your easy court companions.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.836
I mistook the asking in your eyes.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.380
Do you not like my kiss?

11:17.594 --> 11:20.358
I wish it were not a sin
to have liked it so.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.527
God made sin...

11:22.732 --> 11:25.292
...that we might know His mercy.

11:58.401 --> 12:00.961
<i>I find myself within his eyes</i>

12:02.172 --> 12:04.663
<i>I long for more of myself to know</i>

12:05.575 --> 12:08.009
<i>He hears, it seems, my silent cries</i>

12:08.712 --> 12:11.340
<i>And makes my heart my reason's foe</i>

12:12.949 --> 12:15.918
<i>How can this be, to love so quickly?</i>

12:16.553 --> 12:18.987
<i>"Love does not wait," is his reply</i>

12:20.190 --> 12:22.784
<i>What magic weaves
his touch to trick me?</i>

12:24.194 --> 12:26.685
<i>How can I now my love deny?</i>

12:36.873 --> 12:38.340
For my bride...

12:38.575 --> 12:41.305
...a little wedding trinket.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.353
Lorenzo Gritti and his fair bride

12:57.761 --> 13:00.389
Your union gives us greatest pride

13:01.064 --> 13:04.397
Good health, great wealth
and lasting line

13:21.351 --> 13:23.581
- How could they?
- How could who what?

13:23.753 --> 13:27.018
Your parents marry your sister off
to that piece of decaying flesh.

13:27.223 --> 13:31.990
That piece of decaying flesh is a cousin
of the doge, confidant of the pope.

13:32.195 --> 13:35.494
- The Roman court adores him.
- They don't have to sleep with him.

13:35.732 --> 13:36.994
You'd be surprised.

13:37.200 --> 13:42.103
Save your blushes. They don't sit well
with the bluntness of your tongue.

13:42.639 --> 13:47.008
Surely they could have traded down
a few ducats for an ounce of virility.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.738
- Why?
- For your sister's sake.

13:48.912 --> 13:49.879
She's a prude.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.447
Then it would hardly have been
more cruel marrying her to God.

13:53.683 --> 13:56.117
God isn't as rich as Lorenzo Gritti.

14:02.625 --> 14:05.992
Do honor to the houses
of Gritti and Venier.

14:06.429 --> 14:07.896
For Venice.

14:32.389 --> 14:36.018
I've seen how you look at her,
how she looks at you. I know that look.

14:36.659 --> 14:39.492
Do not underestimate
love's allure, Marco.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.026
Enjoy it...

14:42.665 --> 14:45.225
...but guard your head and your heart.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.902
You cannot marry her.

14:48.438 --> 14:49.564
I know.

14:51.741 --> 14:52.901
Pietro, come.

15:11.261 --> 15:13.320
I wish that were our bridal chamber.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.601
You think me terribly wicked
for saying that?

15:32.182 --> 15:34.013
You know we can't marry.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.955
I know only what you tell me.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.853
I must marry...

15:44.461 --> 15:48.022
...according to my station
and my family's wealth.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.061
Then why are you here?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.864
Because I could not stay away.

15:55.138 --> 15:56.503
Then don't.

15:59.976 --> 16:03.434
My marriage must be a marriage of state.

16:07.150 --> 16:09.914
My people are true citizens
700 years back.

16:10.753 --> 16:13.187
A coat of arms does not
an inheritance make.

16:14.757 --> 16:16.691
I speak of love and you talk of money.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.860
Of my duty.

16:18.094 --> 16:19.118
And your heart?

16:19.829 --> 16:22.423
This isn't about my heart,
it's about politics.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.269
How romantic.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.341
Marriage isn't romantic.
That's why God invented poetry.

16:33.543 --> 16:35.374
To sweeten men's lying lips!

16:35.578 --> 16:37.910
If I were a liar,
would I tell you this now?

16:38.114 --> 16:40.605
If you cared for me,
you could not tell me this ever.

16:42.619 --> 16:44.086
I want you.

16:48.391 --> 16:49.915
Not enough.

17:09.145 --> 17:11.409
Daughter, you have reached too high.

17:12.148 --> 17:14.742
I told you, marriage is a contract.

17:17.320 --> 17:21.086
To a man of Marco's station,
it has nothing to do with love.

17:23.159 --> 17:25.423
But you can still have Marco.

17:29.599 --> 17:31.260
But not in wedlock.

17:36.940 --> 17:39.272
There's an alternative to marriage.

17:42.178 --> 17:43.611
You'll become a courtesan.

17:47.283 --> 17:51.185
I've seen you watching them.
I've seen you mesmerized by them.

17:53.957 --> 17:56.016
You'll become a courtesan...

17:58.528 --> 18:00.155
...like your mother used to be.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.473
You were a courtesan?

18:13.476 --> 18:14.738
One of the best.

18:18.581 --> 18:19.309
When?

18:20.550 --> 18:22.017
A long time ago.

18:25.221 --> 18:28.884
I had hoped to buy you a good marriage.

18:29.392 --> 18:30.950
But your father...

18:31.494 --> 18:33.519
...drank away your dowry.

18:33.896 --> 18:35.659
Your brother must buy his posting.

18:36.065 --> 18:37.828
And I am too old.

18:38.801 --> 18:39.597
It is you...

18:40.169 --> 18:42.228
...who must support us now.

18:44.741 --> 18:45.799
Look at these hands.

18:46.476 --> 18:47.704
Soft.

18:49.245 --> 18:50.337
Too soft...

18:50.546 --> 18:52.138
...for a scullery maid...

18:52.348 --> 18:54.077
...or working the winery.

18:54.484 --> 18:56.349
Perhaps a lady's maid.

18:59.255 --> 19:02.520
- Wouldn't that be funny?
- Send me to the convent then!

19:02.725 --> 19:04.192
You are not the type.

19:04.427 --> 19:05.860
How would you know?

19:10.833 --> 19:11.800
What're you doing?

19:12.602 --> 19:16.231
Whichever devil you choose,
you'll look him in the eye first...

19:16.439 --> 19:18.407
...which is more than my mother gave me.

19:57.780 --> 20:01.147
First secret of all great courtesans:

20:02.485 --> 20:04.453
You must know pleasure...

20:04.687 --> 20:06.211
...to give pleasure.

20:07.590 --> 20:10.423
Beauty is a manifestation of the divine.

20:10.626 --> 20:14.062
That theory built the Sistine Chapel,
and it'll do the same for you.

20:16.299 --> 20:19.200
Height is an advantage to women
as well as men.

20:19.836 --> 20:22.134
Carriage creates the first impression.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.136
Come with me, Veronica.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.310
Mother, we can't go in there.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.274
Ladies can't go in there.

21:38.247 --> 21:39.874
Courtesans can.

21:50.893 --> 21:54.488
The emperor Pericles relied
more for policy on his mistress...

21:54.697 --> 21:56.927
...than he ever did on his lieutenants.

21:57.600 --> 22:01.900
Courtesans, my dear, are the
most educated women in the world.

22:33.035 --> 22:36.402
<i>A courtesan is a force of nature
in a civilized cloak.</i>

22:36.706 --> 22:39.436
<i>Any chambermaid can flop down,
take off her shirt...</i>

22:39.642 --> 22:40.768
<i>... and men will come.</i>

22:40.943 --> 22:45.312
Your true power comes from
something much deeper than beauty.

22:46.215 --> 22:47.614
Cleopatra knew that.

22:48.084 --> 22:49.346
Theodosia.

22:49.552 --> 22:52.646
Aspasia.
She could seduce a man at 20 paces...

22:52.822 --> 22:55.188
...without revealing an inch of flesh.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.156
How?

22:57.460 --> 22:58.825
With her mind.

22:59.462 --> 23:00.952
Desire begins in the mind.

23:02.365 --> 23:03.798
I don't understand.

23:05.534 --> 23:06.501
No, you don't.

23:09.372 --> 23:10.498
Think of Marco.

23:13.676 --> 23:15.303
I know you know anger.

23:17.613 --> 23:18.841
Try disdain.

23:26.622 --> 23:27.589
Amusement.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.629
Submission.

23:41.637 --> 23:42.604
Rapture.

23:54.884 --> 23:55.851
Now...

23:57.553 --> 24:01.011
...make him believe that he is
the only man in the universe.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.237
Who taught you?

24:22.745 --> 24:24.144
Your grandmother.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.956
In order to choose your lovers wisely,
you need to understand men.

24:36.826 --> 24:39.056
No matter their shape or size...

24:40.363 --> 24:41.796
...position or wealth...

24:43.699 --> 24:44.825
...they all dream...

24:45.034 --> 24:46.365
...of the temptress.

24:49.538 --> 24:50.869
The irresistible...

24:51.073 --> 24:53.371
...unapproachable Venus...

24:54.377 --> 24:57.744
...who quickly turns pliable maiden
when they've had a hard day.

25:48.798 --> 25:49.765
Come.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.762
You can't be squeamish.

25:54.603 --> 25:56.332
If you don't enjoy it...

25:56.806 --> 25:59.502
...they'll smell it,
like a dog smells fear.

26:00.609 --> 26:02.338
And they'll hate you for it.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.146
What's there to be squeamish about?

26:17.460 --> 26:18.757
If you touch...

26:18.994 --> 26:20.086
...here.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.232
Amazing.

26:25.468 --> 26:26.867
Use your fingers lightly...

26:27.069 --> 26:28.536
...like feathers.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.770
Your tongue, like licking sweets.

26:34.477 --> 26:36.445
Your teeth, with restraint.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.708
Just enough...

26:41.183 --> 26:43.151
...to keep him wanting more.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.320
It's wanting...

26:45.855 --> 26:47.550
...that keeps us alive.

27:54.557 --> 27:56.184
Minister Ramberti.

27:56.859 --> 27:59.589
I'd like to present you
to my daughter, Veronica.

28:01.363 --> 28:03.763
It would bring me luck if you'd
play a hand for me.

28:06.635 --> 28:09.229
Remember, Veronica, love love.

28:09.471 --> 28:11.996
But do not love the man,
or you'll be in his power.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.573
Good luck.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.605
May I call?

28:22.384 --> 28:23.851
May I call?

28:29.792 --> 28:31.054
Lovely.

28:40.402 --> 28:42.563
This is my first bet.

28:42.738 --> 28:44.262
Your first?

28:45.074 --> 28:46.974
Unmistakably.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.142
I'm honored.

28:53.882 --> 28:55.816
Repent your empty excesses!

28:56.252 --> 28:58.117
There is no comfort here.

29:07.529 --> 29:08.655
Friends.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.459
May I ask you, is this God's game?

29:11.700 --> 29:13.668
Why do you gamble with your souls?

29:13.836 --> 29:15.167
What is it you want?

29:15.537 --> 29:17.095
Your salvation.

29:19.108 --> 29:21.269
This is no company for one so fair.

29:41.630 --> 29:44.758
Venice may as well be deemed
one large floating brothel.

29:44.967 --> 29:47.936
What's biting your ass
this fair evening, cousin?

29:50.372 --> 29:53.830
You'd begrudge the fairer sex
their little crumbs?

29:54.310 --> 29:58.144
No, though they do make more
in a night than I a month.

29:58.580 --> 30:00.707
Go make yourself useful.
Give us a rhyme.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.443
I'm no performing monkey
for the idle masses.

30:03.686 --> 30:04.983
Since when?

30:05.187 --> 30:08.054
We're all of us
performing monkeys, nephew.

30:08.424 --> 30:09.891
Paupers and poets alike.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.751
I'm at your service, Uncle.

30:14.363 --> 30:16.695
If it's rhyme you wish,
I'll gladly oblige.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.031
A subject?

30:21.837 --> 30:22.531
Doge?

30:25.541 --> 30:28.203
Venice. To celebrate our plenty.

30:31.013 --> 30:32.708
Born in glory

30:33.248 --> 30:35.910
The virgin's exultation

30:36.652 --> 30:38.745
Fair and mighty Venice

30:39.254 --> 30:40.380
Queen of the sea

30:40.756 --> 30:42.724
Unconquered maid

30:43.025 --> 30:45.255
Sovereign isle is she

30:50.933 --> 30:52.161
Chaste goddess

30:52.368 --> 30:54.928
Rising from the foamy depths

30:57.740 --> 30:58.707
Wine?

30:58.941 --> 31:00.101
Please.

31:23.265 --> 31:25.893
<i>Signor Venier? Don't be absurd.</i>

31:26.235 --> 31:28.066
I'm not being absurd.
I'm just...

31:28.303 --> 31:30.737
...treating you with indifference,
as you did me.

31:30.906 --> 31:33.739
You confuse indifference with honesty.

31:33.909 --> 31:35.740
You confuse honesty with venality.

31:35.911 --> 31:37.879
You think me venal?

31:38.213 --> 31:40.408
You are a venal cur.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.579
Hello, Marco.

31:43.786 --> 31:45.413
Something I can do for you?

31:56.598 --> 32:00.056
Here, beauty, wit and wealth combined

32:01.770 --> 32:04.261
Gateway 'twixt distant East and West

32:04.706 --> 32:06.139
Mother of liberty

32:06.341 --> 32:07.467
Child of honor

32:07.709 --> 32:10.303
Home and hearth and heart

32:10.512 --> 32:12.946
To men of valor

32:24.259 --> 32:27.422
Perhaps the fair maiden can do better.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.004
A duel!

33:02.498 --> 33:03.829
Venice...

33:04.399 --> 33:05.491
...mother...

33:06.568 --> 33:08.399
...virgin, queen and...

33:09.171 --> 33:10.331
...goddess

33:12.407 --> 33:14.875
To be all 5 at once is no mean trick.

33:17.279 --> 33:20.715
If women's lust lost Eden
Our redress to be

33:21.383 --> 33:25.114
Hearth, heart and home to every...

33:26.455 --> 33:27.183
...prick.

33:31.793 --> 33:32.657
Who is she?

33:39.968 --> 33:41.435
Sweet lagoon

33:42.237 --> 33:43.966
That brings us...

33:44.306 --> 33:45.739
...Iovely life

33:52.581 --> 33:54.310
Rank with...

33:54.650 --> 33:57.278
...greed and trade's...

33:59.254 --> 34:00.915
...devouring strife

34:12.534 --> 34:13.967
Lady Venice

34:17.940 --> 34:20.374
Her raiment, as the moon doth glow

34:23.011 --> 34:24.478
Her wisdom

34:24.680 --> 34:27.945
Her wisdom shines bright
As envious day

34:29.284 --> 34:31.184
Her wives...

34:31.620 --> 34:33.144
...like booty...

34:34.356 --> 34:36.187
...are locked away

35:09.391 --> 35:11.552
Never ever hide that face again.

36:50.759 --> 36:52.454
Children are a deficit.

36:53.662 --> 36:55.289
It's not infallible.

36:55.497 --> 36:57.795
It's more comfortable
than a turtle shell.

37:05.807 --> 37:07.240
So?

37:10.278 --> 37:12.337
You didn't tell me everything.

37:13.281 --> 37:14.680
How could I?

37:21.757 --> 37:23.725
They won't all be Rambertis.

37:30.699 --> 37:32.166
Who's next?

37:56.958 --> 37:59.392
<i>Honor us with a poem, Signora Veronica.</i>

38:00.328 --> 38:03.195
I would be too humbled
before such eloquent minds.

38:03.398 --> 38:05.366
Make us laugh as you did before.

38:05.567 --> 38:08.593
Perhaps if I'm clever
next time I shall make you weep.

38:08.804 --> 38:11.568
I shall weep if I don't
see you again.

38:12.073 --> 38:13.335
Thursday?

38:13.809 --> 38:15.174
Every Thursday?

38:15.510 --> 38:17.740
I shall count the hours in between.

38:19.881 --> 38:23.248
Scrape any lower
you can have shoes for earrings.

38:24.085 --> 38:27.521
Why, Marco Venier,
I do believe you're jealous.

38:27.756 --> 38:29.951
I can only be jealous
of what I cannot have.

38:30.192 --> 38:33.628
- And you cannot have me.
- There's no one in Venice I can't have.

38:33.829 --> 38:36.764
And there's not a man in Venice
that I can't have.

38:37.132 --> 38:39.430
We are so alike, you and me.

38:40.001 --> 38:44.199
We both know that love is inconvenient,
if not impossible.

38:45.273 --> 38:49.437
So why not enjoy what little
we're allowed together?

38:55.450 --> 38:57.384
I'm all booked up.

39:08.864 --> 39:09.831
Well?

39:10.232 --> 39:11.256
Well, what?

39:19.808 --> 39:21.571
I see you're enjoying yourself.

39:21.743 --> 39:23.335
<i>Yes, thank you, Signor Venier.</i>

39:23.578 --> 39:24.545
Domenico.

39:24.746 --> 39:26.941
Otherwise, you'll make me feel old.

39:27.249 --> 39:28.876
Let me help you.

39:29.885 --> 39:32.376
It's not a sight
for such beautiful eyes.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.487
I'm not afraid of flesh.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.017
The man who bid you rhyme...

40:06.321 --> 40:08.482
...Francesco Martenengo...

40:08.957 --> 40:10.891
...admiral of our fleet.

40:14.596 --> 40:17.087
Whatever you do, don't make him mad.

40:17.766 --> 40:19.290
Bishop De La Torre.

40:19.534 --> 40:23.766
His collection of paintings is surpassed
only by his collection of women.

40:24.506 --> 40:25.632
So many?

40:25.807 --> 40:27.069
Biblical.

40:28.910 --> 40:29.934
Ramberti, you know.

40:30.345 --> 40:33.473
Minister of Defense.
I tell you, he's in love with you.

40:33.682 --> 40:36.446
You say that as if
you thought it a disease.

40:37.919 --> 40:40.479
You think, perhaps,
I want you for myself?

40:41.523 --> 40:43.047
I would not presume.

40:43.458 --> 40:44.482
Pity.

40:44.826 --> 40:47.659
I was flattered to think
you might harbor such suspicions...

40:47.829 --> 40:49.797
...under the circumstances.

40:49.998 --> 40:52.865
I would be happy to attend to you
under any circumstances.

41:24.199 --> 41:26.963
"All the best courtesans have one."

41:27.669 --> 41:30.797
<i>Signor Marco Venier
wishes your audience.</i>

41:42.584 --> 41:45.985
A peacock does not an inheritance make.

42:12.747 --> 42:16.012
Look at these gowns.
Each is a unique work of art.

43:09.003 --> 43:09.970
Charming spectacle.

43:10.905 --> 43:12.099
I've seen better.

43:13.074 --> 43:14.405
Must be interesting...

43:14.609 --> 43:17.942
...being in a room full of men, most of
whom you've seen naked.

43:18.513 --> 43:21.448
Puts it all in some kind of perspective.

43:24.819 --> 43:26.411
I was wondering...

43:27.322 --> 43:30.689
I would enjoy it if perhaps we might...

43:30.992 --> 43:32.823
...exchange verse again...

43:33.328 --> 43:34.192
...some night.

43:45.540 --> 43:48.737
We can't afford one another, Maffio.
We're both...

43:48.943 --> 43:51.241
...courtiers singing for our supper.

43:53.181 --> 43:54.648
Of course.

44:15.803 --> 44:17.703
What was Cousin Maffio on about?

44:17.872 --> 44:19.931
The pleasures of poetry.

44:21.576 --> 44:22.736
Enjoy the hunt?

44:23.811 --> 44:27.508
The hunt possesses,
doesn't it, such a cruel beauty?

44:27.715 --> 44:29.307
Much like your own.

44:30.151 --> 44:31.550
Is my beauty cruel?

44:31.753 --> 44:33.550
I think so.

44:34.989 --> 44:37.457
To those that you refuse, yes.

44:38.059 --> 44:40.892
It is only my refusal
that arouses your longing.

44:41.095 --> 44:42.153
You underrate yourself.

44:42.397 --> 44:43.523
Flatterer.

44:43.765 --> 44:45.130
Put it to the test.

44:45.333 --> 44:46.561
Say yes...

44:46.768 --> 44:48.736
...and then see if you're rid of me.

44:49.170 --> 44:50.831
Let's see.

44:51.172 --> 44:53.072
If I'm right...

44:53.708 --> 44:56.734
...you'll tire of me,
and if you're right, I'll tire of you.

45:00.548 --> 45:02.982
Maybe we should just stay as we are.

45:07.422 --> 45:09.185
You know I do regret...

45:11.025 --> 45:13.084
...the hurt that I caused you.

45:18.366 --> 45:19.890
With all my heart.

45:28.109 --> 45:29.508
The heart is higher up.

45:36.951 --> 45:39.112
Her father owns half of Lombardy...

45:39.320 --> 45:43.256
...and her aunt is the pope's niece. An
alliance with this family is a godsend.

45:44.892 --> 45:47.656
You will marry Giulia da Lezze...

45:48.229 --> 45:50.891
...for Venice, if for no other reason.

46:01.909 --> 46:04.878
You have the feigned indifference
of a man in love.

46:08.916 --> 46:10.144
Go on, son...

46:11.252 --> 46:13.186
...tell the truth and shame the devil.

46:23.698 --> 46:25.962
The Turks are on the move again?

46:26.167 --> 46:29.227
The sultan wants the Mediterranean
for his bathing pool.

46:29.771 --> 46:32.638
So what is that heavenly thing?

46:33.941 --> 46:35.272
Ermine.

46:47.655 --> 46:49.350
I'm an ass!

46:53.528 --> 46:55.359
My little poetess.

46:55.596 --> 46:57.257
I'm an ass!

46:57.465 --> 46:58.762
You are the brightest...

46:59.200 --> 47:02.795
...star in the Venetian firmament.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.036
Excuse me.

47:06.541 --> 47:07.838
The coldest.

47:08.042 --> 47:09.009
Cold.

47:09.210 --> 47:10.541
But also the brightest.

47:13.881 --> 47:15.439
My uncle...

47:16.150 --> 47:17.811
...tells me...

47:18.152 --> 47:19.676
...I have...

47:19.887 --> 47:23.084
...the feigned indifference of a man...

47:34.068 --> 47:35.831
Of a man about to be married.

47:42.944 --> 47:45.504
I'm getting married. Congratulate me.

47:47.014 --> 47:49.505
Felicitations on your grand match.

47:51.152 --> 47:52.915
Generously put.

47:54.589 --> 47:55.715
Do you love her?

47:56.758 --> 47:57.918
Do I have to?

48:03.364 --> 48:05.423
I hope it's a profitable union.

48:57.485 --> 48:58.952
Do you like poetry?

49:00.421 --> 49:02.150
I know the Psalms.

49:07.428 --> 49:08.895
Tell me a secret.

49:11.666 --> 49:14.760
- I have no secrets.
- Everyone has secrets.

49:20.441 --> 49:22.409
Tell me a desire.

49:24.278 --> 49:25.745
Deep desire.

49:30.618 --> 49:32.813
I hope to give you many strong sons.

49:33.020 --> 49:35.352
No, I mean something...

49:38.125 --> 49:39.353
...for you.

49:40.194 --> 49:41.957
Something just for you.

49:48.369 --> 49:51.304
To be a good wife to you
is my only desire.

50:02.984 --> 50:06.545
<i>'Tis not wanton flesh
But love that brings me shame</i>

50:08.256 --> 50:11.453
<i>Mocked by fate
Imprisoned by my womb</i>

50:13.194 --> 50:16.857
My jealousy possessed
Which slow consumes

50:17.598 --> 50:20.192
An ice-cold, gloomy vicious flame

50:21.869 --> 50:24.497
I love the very weapons which me wound

50:44.292 --> 50:47.159
Lucky is the man
that can inspire your poet's heart.

50:48.396 --> 50:50.591
The only form she's mastered
is a whore's.

50:53.968 --> 50:58.132
Honestly, I didn't think Uncle
was still capable of getting it up.

51:00.775 --> 51:04.506
What did you do to him, to get him
to publish this little pile of ditties?

51:05.913 --> 51:08.643
Won't give the time of day
to his own flesh and blood.

51:09.250 --> 51:10.979
She worked for it.

51:12.987 --> 51:14.784
I'll bet she worked for it.

51:15.556 --> 51:17.080
What do you cost these days?

51:18.659 --> 51:22.857
If your prick is as limp as your verse,
no price could purchase time enough.

51:34.976 --> 51:36.739
Just making a point, Cousin.

51:36.944 --> 51:38.741
Very brave.
What point would that be?

51:39.513 --> 51:40.980
I'm sorry.

51:41.349 --> 51:42.179
I'm sorry.

51:44.619 --> 51:46.348
I apologize.

52:14.649 --> 52:19.143
Have you the guts to try again
Blade to blade and pen to pen?

52:23.858 --> 52:25.655
Madonna Veronica.

52:31.332 --> 52:33.163
Veritably unique whore

52:35.503 --> 52:37.232
May sing...

52:37.538 --> 52:38.971
...and rhyme...

52:39.173 --> 52:40.299
...and more

52:41.008 --> 52:42.134
Still...

52:42.810 --> 52:44.710
...is at best a slut

52:44.879 --> 52:47.609
With every horny mutt

52:51.352 --> 52:55.254
You pride yourself on arts and letters

52:55.956 --> 52:57.787
And fucking best your manly betters

53:02.196 --> 53:07.133
I save the goodly wives of Venice
From their husbands' lustful menace

53:16.110 --> 53:18.078
Then you confess...

53:18.913 --> 53:20.608
...you love...

53:22.717 --> 53:23.615
...to rut

53:23.784 --> 53:27.242
And your beauty's gladly stuck

53:38.065 --> 53:39.532
Little mistake.

53:55.883 --> 53:57.248
I confess...

53:57.451 --> 53:59.419
...I fuck divinely

53:59.653 --> 54:02.417
Those who love and well opine me

54:03.157 --> 54:04.681
I confess...

54:04.892 --> 54:06.860
...I fuck divinely

54:07.094 --> 54:08.493
Those who...

54:08.963 --> 54:10.794
...richly wine and dine me

54:23.811 --> 54:27.907
On the page or on the sheet
You'll never find a tongue more sweet

54:28.516 --> 54:30.950
On the page or on the sheet

54:33.521 --> 54:36.615
On the page or on the sheet
Greet bleat...

54:36.824 --> 54:40.760
On the page or on the sheet
A greater hack you'll never meet.

54:48.769 --> 54:50.066
You fight like a sailor.

54:50.271 --> 54:52.967
I learned from a sailor.
Now stop stalling.

54:58.646 --> 55:01.376
Recant the curse you give my kind

55:01.849 --> 55:04.909
Admit I have, as you, a heart and mind

55:05.486 --> 55:08.944
A greedy hand, an empty heart
Is all that wrests your legs apart

58:57.718 --> 59:01.518
How did you let this paragon of cities
turn into a cesspit...

59:01.722 --> 59:03.553
...of vice and depravity?

59:04.458 --> 59:07.621
For as the waters flow
through Venice every day...

59:07.928 --> 59:10.089
...and wash away the filth...

59:18.572 --> 59:20.005
Do you not agree?

59:21.208 --> 59:22.937
I think not.

59:23.210 --> 59:26.407
A soul in torment is a soul without God.

59:27.114 --> 59:29.582
All flesh is grass.

59:30.417 --> 59:32.078
We must all meet our Maker.

59:32.286 --> 59:34.447
To this end we must all come.

59:34.688 --> 59:36.747
Even Venetians.

59:39.960 --> 59:42.224
You can be saved, my brother.

59:47.301 --> 59:48.461
You can...

59:49.136 --> 59:51.195
...cure me of my desire...

59:51.972 --> 59:53.564
...young idealist?

59:54.141 --> 59:55.199
No.

59:55.809 --> 59:57.242
I can't.

1:00:05.152 --> 1:00:07.245
Tonight's too many hours away.

1:00:20.167 --> 1:00:22.658
My affections aren't mine
to give you tonight.

1:00:23.270 --> 1:00:24.237
What?

1:00:26.173 --> 1:00:27.970
I have mouths to feed like you.

1:00:29.476 --> 1:00:30.500
I'll support you.

1:00:32.946 --> 1:00:35.176
No. There will no money between us.

1:00:35.415 --> 1:00:38.179
So you'd continue with this life?

1:00:38.485 --> 1:00:41.750
I have no choice.
This is the life I was given.

1:00:44.191 --> 1:00:45.715
You do have a choice.

1:00:45.959 --> 1:00:48.154
If I were yours alone, your property...

1:00:48.362 --> 1:00:49.624
...you'd soon tire of me.

1:00:49.796 --> 1:00:50.694
You're wrong.

1:00:51.031 --> 1:00:52.225
Am I?

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:56.465
If you cared for me,
you could not do this.

1:00:56.670 --> 1:00:58.638
Do not ask of me what you cannot give.

1:01:00.507 --> 1:01:02.475
Your wife is waiting.

1:01:11.251 --> 1:01:12.513
What ails you, Marco?

1:01:20.194 --> 1:01:21.126
What do you mean?

1:01:38.111 --> 1:01:40.011
I want to be a good wife.

1:01:47.254 --> 1:01:49.188
Impending deprivation...

1:01:49.790 --> 1:01:51.917
...always makes me hungry.

1:01:53.794 --> 1:01:55.022
My dear...

1:01:55.662 --> 1:01:57.095
...you're not eating.

1:01:58.732 --> 1:02:00.700
But you are though, darling.

1:02:01.802 --> 1:02:06.330
There'll be no more of these little
delicacies if the sultan turns nasty.

1:02:13.380 --> 1:02:16.213
Why are bells ringing
at this time of night?

1:02:22.556 --> 1:02:23.989
The sultan has attacked.

1:02:24.224 --> 1:02:26.715
He took 8 ships near Malta.

1:02:29.997 --> 1:02:33.194
If we don't sail for Cyprus by Easter,
we won't be sailing back.

1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:36.801
- Sooner, I think.
- If we can't rally France, we won't.

1:02:37.004 --> 1:02:38.835
The Turks have 3 ships to our 1.

1:02:39.039 --> 1:02:41.701
- Will the King of France help us?
- If we amuse him.

1:02:41.875 --> 1:02:44.139
King Henry's a boy in men's breeches.

1:02:44.344 --> 1:02:46.744
- A powerful boy.
- A boy nonetheless.

1:02:46.913 --> 1:02:50.246
He commands a lot of ships
and has no love for the Turks.

1:02:57.257 --> 1:02:59.725
Your wife believes
she has bewitched you.

1:03:00.093 --> 1:03:02.323
What's the harm in bewitching
a married man?

1:03:02.562 --> 1:03:05.998
That man has to have heirs.
He's to be a senator soon.

1:03:06.466 --> 1:03:07.433
So he shall.

1:03:10.737 --> 1:03:13.433
What God and greed
have joined together...

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:17.343
...let no love put asunder.

1:03:25.452 --> 1:03:27.750
The woman you love is not good...

1:03:28.789 --> 1:03:30.757
...not pure, not meek.

1:03:30.957 --> 1:03:34.051
I'm a courtesan. It's the only thing
you'll let me do...

1:03:34.294 --> 1:03:36.023
I can't bear it.

1:03:36.229 --> 1:03:38.197
I know I have no right...

1:03:38.398 --> 1:03:40.366
...but I won't share you.

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:43.398
But I must share you. I must bear that.
I have no choice.

1:03:43.904 --> 1:03:46.964
Please don't envy Giulia.
She will never have what you have.

1:03:49.242 --> 1:03:50.470
Please trust me.

1:03:53.313 --> 1:03:54.871
I don't know how.

1:03:55.115 --> 1:03:57.083
I'll earn your trust.

1:03:57.617 --> 1:03:58.413
Let me.

1:04:00.987 --> 1:04:02.420
You'll go to war and die.

1:04:09.763 --> 1:04:12.129
Stay with me for as long as we have.

1:04:13.700 --> 1:04:16.066
And be your private whore?

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:17.930
Don't ever say that.

1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:21.705
You're Veronica Franco.

1:04:23.510 --> 1:04:24.943
You're a poet.

1:04:27.114 --> 1:04:28.376
And you're my lady.

1:04:42.195 --> 1:04:43.992
Cancel my appointments, please.

1:04:49.736 --> 1:04:52.296
It's a treacherous game you play,
my little idiot.

1:04:54.875 --> 1:04:56.809
You outdid me long ago.

1:04:57.210 --> 1:04:58.541
I know that.

1:04:59.312 --> 1:05:01.439
And the irony is, it's not because...

1:05:02.048 --> 1:05:04.881
...you're prettier than I was,
because you're not.

1:05:05.318 --> 1:05:08.014
Nor that you're a better lay,
because you aren't.

1:05:08.555 --> 1:05:11.217
It's because you're smarter.
You have a gift.

1:05:11.425 --> 1:05:14.986
- Don't throw it away.
- For God's sake, haven't I done enough?

1:05:15.228 --> 1:05:17.719
He's a client like the others.
Love him and lose.

1:06:38.478 --> 1:06:40.446
I must go. King Henry's coming.

1:06:42.449 --> 1:06:44.076
I'll get my things.

1:07:12.045 --> 1:07:14.479
You've been selfish,
keeping her hidden away.

1:07:15.482 --> 1:07:17.074
You came back in time...

1:07:17.317 --> 1:07:19.751
...to seduce the French king.
He arrives tomorrow.

1:07:19.986 --> 1:07:21.749
He'd let Paris burn for a good lay.

1:07:21.955 --> 1:07:23.354
He'll hardly fight for Venice.

1:07:23.557 --> 1:07:25.650
Depends on how Venice lays him.

1:07:25.892 --> 1:07:28.622
I don't mind fighting,
but I prefer a war I can win.

1:07:28.828 --> 1:07:31.456
Without France's ships,
it's a suicide mission.

1:07:59.159 --> 1:08:00.922
Glorious architecture.

1:08:22.549 --> 1:08:23.641
Good Henry!

1:08:23.883 --> 1:08:26.283
We must fight the infidels here...

1:08:26.486 --> 1:08:29.421
...before we can beat them abroad!
Before we can fight them at home!

1:08:30.323 --> 1:08:32.223
Take this paper to the king!

1:08:32.425 --> 1:08:36.054
Let me go! I'm a man of God!
Give him this paper!

1:08:37.397 --> 1:08:41.060
France has zealots too. We prefer
heretics. They're not so serious.

1:08:41.735 --> 1:08:44.431
Zealots are creating
difficulties everywhere.

1:08:59.252 --> 1:09:00.549
Our captains tell us...

1:09:00.754 --> 1:09:03.279
...the Muslim Turks have been
spotted near Cyprus.

1:09:05.091 --> 1:09:07.059
Rather presumptuous, don't you think?

1:09:08.094 --> 1:09:12.428
Rather presumptuous to think
the Church wouldn't come to its defense?

1:09:14.534 --> 1:09:17.162
What about these courtesans
Venice is so famous for?

1:09:20.273 --> 1:09:22.571
The sultan is too experienced
to gamble...

1:09:22.742 --> 1:09:23.868
I'd like to meet them.

1:09:27.113 --> 1:09:28.080
Are they nearby?

1:10:07.454 --> 1:10:09.979
Who's that? She's not with the others.

1:10:10.657 --> 1:10:14.320
Veronica Franco, Your Excellency.
The poetess.

1:10:15.161 --> 1:10:16.628
Is she a courtesan?

1:10:18.231 --> 1:10:19.789
She is, Your Highness.

1:10:20.233 --> 1:10:21.325
Tell her to come forward.

1:10:51.698 --> 1:10:52.722
I want her.

1:11:15.722 --> 1:11:17.246
Most exquisite.

1:11:18.858 --> 1:11:22.157
- You do me great honor.
- I take you from the one you love.

1:11:25.131 --> 1:11:27.099
You have to say that.
I'm the king.

1:11:29.369 --> 1:11:31.860
I have to say that
because Venice needs you.

1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:15.807
What do you yearn for, IKing Henry?

1:12:42.308 --> 1:12:43.775
You've heard the rumors.

1:12:44.544 --> 1:12:45.806
Yes, sire.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:48.440
The king is a pervert.

1:12:51.651 --> 1:12:53.619
What do you really yearn for?

1:12:55.588 --> 1:12:56.555
Tears.

1:12:59.025 --> 1:13:00.185
Your tears.

1:13:03.029 --> 1:13:04.894
You yearn for my tears?

1:13:11.671 --> 1:13:12.899
I don't think so.

1:13:18.177 --> 1:13:19.508
Then what do I yearn for?

1:14:03.289 --> 1:14:05.257
Why don't we find out?

1:15:00.613 --> 1:15:01.773
You'll get your ships.

1:15:13.159 --> 1:15:15.423
- Poet to kings.
- A national asset.

1:15:15.628 --> 1:15:17.289
More than 100 French ships.

1:15:17.530 --> 1:15:19.828
We should make you
ambassador to the emperor.

1:15:20.533 --> 1:15:21.966
He doesn't deserve her.

1:15:26.706 --> 1:15:29.140
Would he sooner we didn't get the ships?

1:15:29.375 --> 1:15:32.776
He would rather he had the right
to refuse even a king your hand.

1:15:43.956 --> 1:15:45.446
I could not refuse.

1:15:45.658 --> 1:15:46.682
Couldn't you?

1:15:47.193 --> 1:15:48.660
I think you like it.

1:15:49.028 --> 1:15:50.655
You like what it has made me.

1:15:54.867 --> 1:15:56.801
I don't like what it makes me.

1:15:57.336 --> 1:15:58.735
Why did you not stop me?

1:16:00.506 --> 1:16:01.803
You're not mine to stop!

1:16:02.041 --> 1:16:03.372
Whose fault is that?

1:16:06.679 --> 1:16:08.772
You sleep with Giulia for duty's sake.

1:16:09.348 --> 1:16:12.749
I slept with the IKing of France once for
duty's sake. Who does not forgive?

1:16:14.353 --> 1:16:15.752
Perhaps I can't live with it.

1:16:32.071 --> 1:16:33.595
I pray God to watch over you.

1:16:34.173 --> 1:16:36.539
Save your prayers, Veronica.

1:16:37.176 --> 1:16:40.805
The devil's got my heart now.
God hasn't a chance.

1:17:45.711 --> 1:17:48.612
We were hoping you'd tell us
what's happening with the war.

1:18:00.726 --> 1:18:02.023
What do you know?

1:18:03.196 --> 1:18:05.460
Just that we're
fighting the Turks again.

1:18:08.935 --> 1:18:10.266
And that's all?

1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:16.907
Their sultan sent us an ultimatum.

1:18:17.109 --> 1:18:21.375
Either we surrender Cyprus or he takes it
by force. Our fleets went to defend it.

1:18:21.614 --> 1:18:24.583
Is Cyprus so important,
we must send our husbands to battle?

1:18:25.218 --> 1:18:26.549
Without Cyprus...

1:18:26.752 --> 1:18:29.186
...we lose control over
the eastern Mediterranean.

1:18:33.659 --> 1:18:35.217
I know we own it...

1:18:35.494 --> 1:18:37.428
...but where exactly is Cyprus?

1:18:37.763 --> 1:18:38.957
My husband...

1:18:39.298 --> 1:18:41.766
...do you know if he is alive or dead?

1:18:43.302 --> 1:18:44.792
Alive and well.

1:18:46.706 --> 1:18:47.673
And mine?

1:18:49.242 --> 1:18:51.676
The admiral is alive. And a hero.

1:18:55.915 --> 1:18:57.109
And my husband?

1:18:57.617 --> 1:18:58.709
Who is your husband?

1:18:58.951 --> 1:18:59.747
Vicco.

1:18:59.952 --> 1:19:01.749
My husband is Pietro Vicco.

1:19:01.921 --> 1:19:03.946
He's strong. He'll come home safely.

1:19:06.926 --> 1:19:08.359
You know her husband well.

1:19:12.698 --> 1:19:15.223
Not at all well,
but his reputation precedes him.

1:19:17.270 --> 1:19:18.328
Go on, ask her.

1:19:20.006 --> 1:19:21.974
Ask her what you're longing to.

1:19:23.809 --> 1:19:28.542
Ask her what draws our husbands
back to her again and again...

1:19:30.049 --> 1:19:31.448
...like pigs to a trough!

1:19:41.460 --> 1:19:44.088
<i>The Latin for banana is ariena.</i>

1:19:46.766 --> 1:19:48.734
<i>Banana tree is pala.</i>

1:20:11.157 --> 1:20:14.786
A woman's greatest
and most hard-won asset...

1:20:15.494 --> 1:20:16.927
...is an education.

1:20:18.331 --> 1:20:22.529
Just because you can say it in Latin
doesn't make it less obscene.

1:20:22.768 --> 1:20:25.396
Just because you took a vow
doesn't mean you know love.

1:20:29.408 --> 1:20:34.004
Either that whore leaves or I leave.
No Christian woman could tolerate this!

1:20:34.246 --> 1:20:36.077
You're unfit to be a mother.

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:39.718
At least I am a mother.

1:20:45.758 --> 1:20:48.192
<i>Thank you for your assistance,
Signora Franco.</i>

1:21:02.742 --> 1:21:04.039
He's alive.

1:21:12.218 --> 1:21:13.685
You made many enemies today.

1:21:14.053 --> 1:21:15.418
They were already enemies.

1:21:15.654 --> 1:21:17.383
Now they will become more so.

1:21:19.125 --> 1:21:20.922
Did you come to warn me?

1:21:30.736 --> 1:21:32.135
...make her a courtesan.

1:21:35.408 --> 1:21:36.898
I will not pimp your daughter.

1:21:37.143 --> 1:21:39.111
Look at the life you live.

1:21:39.812 --> 1:21:41.541
The freedom that you have.

1:21:41.747 --> 1:21:43.612
You'll deny my daughter
the same chance?

1:21:47.086 --> 1:21:48.348
Turn right up ahead.

1:21:53.459 --> 1:21:54.426
Look.

1:21:55.594 --> 1:21:56.993
Look outside.

1:22:05.004 --> 1:22:06.972
This is where we go to die.

1:22:07.940 --> 1:22:09.908
You will not end here.

1:22:12.878 --> 1:22:15.176
Livia, Venice's reigning Venus.

1:22:16.715 --> 1:22:18.512
A jealous lover did that.

1:22:21.787 --> 1:22:23.254
Who wants her now?

1:22:26.125 --> 1:22:28.593
My cage seems bigger than yours,
but it's still a cage.

1:22:28.828 --> 1:22:30.557
You won't get sympathy from me.

1:22:30.796 --> 1:22:31.956
I don't want it.

1:22:32.198 --> 1:22:35.998
Do you know what my
daughter's nurse told her today?

1:22:37.670 --> 1:22:40.161
That in a girl's voice lies temptation.

1:22:41.941 --> 1:22:46.810
A known fact. Eloquence in a woman
means promiscuity.

1:22:47.646 --> 1:22:48.943
Promiscuity of the mind...

1:22:49.148 --> 1:22:51.981
...leads to promiscuity of the body.

1:22:53.986 --> 1:22:56.614
She doesn't believe her yet,
but she will.

1:22:57.056 --> 1:22:58.546
She'll grow up like her mother.

1:22:59.492 --> 1:23:02.359
She'll marry, bear children...

1:23:02.561 --> 1:23:06.361
...and honor her family.
Spend her youth in needlepoint...

1:23:09.335 --> 1:23:10.825
And when she dies...

1:23:11.170 --> 1:23:14.833
...she'll wonder why she obeyed
all the rules of God and country...

1:23:15.074 --> 1:23:17.975
...because no biblical hell
could ever be worse...

1:23:18.177 --> 1:23:20.907
...than this state
of perpetual inconsequence.

1:23:29.388 --> 1:23:32.084
<i>Silent God ignores my prayer</i>

1:23:32.625 --> 1:23:34.024
<i>And renders lost</i>

1:23:34.226 --> 1:23:36.057
<i>What once was fair</i>

1:23:37.229 --> 1:23:40.255
<i>Once blissful
Fortune's favorite city</i>

1:23:41.634 --> 1:23:43.261
<i>Now wheeled fate turns</i>

1:23:44.470 --> 1:23:46.233
<i>No trace of pity</i>

1:23:56.148 --> 1:23:58.582
<i>Citizens of Venice!</i>

1:23:58.817 --> 1:24:02.514
<i>Look around you now
at the disease and deaths...</i>

1:24:02.755 --> 1:24:07.158
<i>... that have taken over
our once beautiful city, and tell me...</i>

1:24:07.660 --> 1:24:10.185
<i>... this plague is not a punishment...</i>

1:24:10.429 --> 1:24:11.828
<i>... from God!</i>

1:24:12.765 --> 1:24:16.064
<i>We are surrounded by harlots...</i>

1:24:16.268 --> 1:24:17.735
<i>... and courtesans!</i>

1:24:18.003 --> 1:24:21.336
<i>We must cast out
those who tempt us...</i>

1:24:21.607 --> 1:24:24.235
...for we are a city of shame...

1:24:25.177 --> 1:24:26.735
<i>... of fornication...</i>

1:24:27.012 --> 1:24:30.743
<i>... and carnal practices
that defy description.</i>

1:24:32.184 --> 1:24:35.745
<i>We will go the way of Sodom
and Gomorrah...</i>

1:24:36.288 --> 1:24:39.348
<i>... and become dust
in the sands of time!</i>

1:24:47.633 --> 1:24:49.794
There's news from Venice.

1:25:23.569 --> 1:25:26.333
The corruption of flesh,
the paint on their faces...

1:25:27.239 --> 1:25:31.175
...the vile coloring of their hair,
their wanton dress...

1:25:31.510 --> 1:25:33.535
Look on them and within yourselves.

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:23.125
You're alive.

1:26:23.862 --> 1:26:25.295
You're alive.

1:26:36.241 --> 1:26:37.606
Forgive me.

1:27:00.766 --> 1:27:02.290
Please forgive me.

1:27:13.445 --> 1:27:14.639
I'm sorry.

1:28:04.963 --> 1:28:06.931
<i>Signora Veronica Franco...</i>

1:28:07.166 --> 1:28:11.865
...I hereby summon you to appear before
the tribunal of the Holy Inquisition.

1:28:13.906 --> 1:28:17.364
You have no jurisdiction here, Senator.
I speak for the Church.

1:28:33.125 --> 1:28:34.592
The Inquisition?

1:28:35.394 --> 1:28:36.361
In Venice?

1:28:36.562 --> 1:28:37.995
We have 56,000 dead.

1:28:39.231 --> 1:28:42.826
The living want answers. They may be
wrong answers, but they want them.

1:28:43.101 --> 1:28:45.194
Be glad the bastards
aren't burning us out.

1:28:45.437 --> 1:28:46.563
You can stop it!

1:28:48.106 --> 1:28:51.542
If the doge came out in defense
of a notorious courtesan...

1:28:51.743 --> 1:28:55.804
Now she's notorious?
Before she was a national asset.

1:28:56.215 --> 1:28:57.978
It would topple the government.

1:28:58.217 --> 1:29:00.048
These are grim times, Senator.

1:29:03.722 --> 1:29:05.314
You're an elected official.

1:29:05.557 --> 1:29:07.457
You cannot refuse your office.

1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:11.129
Then you compel me
to condone these proceedings.

1:29:11.330 --> 1:29:13.764
Am I mistaken, or is Venice
still a free republic?

1:30:51.330 --> 1:30:54.493
By order of the pope, the Inquisition
has come to Venice...

1:30:54.733 --> 1:30:58.567
...to seek out heresy and beliefs
anathema to the Church.

1:30:59.871 --> 1:31:01.361
Veronica Franco...

1:31:02.674 --> 1:31:03.936
...you have been denounced...

1:31:04.142 --> 1:31:08.602
...on the charge of witchcraft,
a mortal sin punishable by death.

1:31:10.048 --> 1:31:13.484
Should you confess and repent
during these proceedings...

1:31:13.685 --> 1:31:18.054
...you will be mercifully welcomed back
into the bosom of the Holy Church.

1:31:21.159 --> 1:31:22.717
Your Holiness...

1:31:22.961 --> 1:31:23.928
Silence!

1:31:25.998 --> 1:31:30.765
The accused shall make no utterance but
to answer our questions or to confess.

1:31:31.436 --> 1:31:32.767
Proceed, Monsignor.

1:31:41.013 --> 1:31:42.037
Venice...

1:31:43.515 --> 1:31:45.449
...ever a noble republic...

1:31:46.018 --> 1:31:47.576
...home of learning...

1:31:48.286 --> 1:31:50.811
...art, commerce...

1:31:51.757 --> 1:31:54.726
...has been brought low
by war and plague.

1:31:55.761 --> 1:31:57.353
Do you know why?

1:31:57.929 --> 1:31:59.863
I am not that wise.

1:32:00.298 --> 1:32:01.230
Tell us...

1:32:01.466 --> 1:32:02.694
...how many...

1:32:03.101 --> 1:32:06.400
...of the worthy men of this city
have you taken into your chamber?

1:32:08.573 --> 1:32:09.938
I've not counted my lovers.

1:32:16.048 --> 1:32:17.174
Answer the question.

1:32:18.784 --> 1:32:19.478
Yes.

1:32:20.052 --> 1:32:21.019
More than 100?

1:32:21.253 --> 1:32:22.117
I don't know.

1:32:22.354 --> 1:32:23.218
You don't?

1:32:23.455 --> 1:32:26.982
Yet for each you paraded your
milky breast and hair of spun copper.

1:32:27.225 --> 1:32:29.625
For each you learned his
unique favored touch...

1:32:29.795 --> 1:32:32.525
...and enchanted him to believe
he was the only man in the universe.

1:32:32.764 --> 1:32:34.095
How many per week?

1:32:35.133 --> 1:32:37.192
I told you. I enchanted no one.

1:32:37.469 --> 1:32:41.735
Did you feign love with more than 10
weekly? Or would 5 or 6 have sated you?

1:32:41.907 --> 1:32:42.999
I never feigned love.

1:32:43.241 --> 1:32:44.173
So why'd they pay?

1:32:46.745 --> 1:32:47.973
For the dream of love...

1:32:49.681 --> 1:32:52.980
...as it cannot exist in this world
that you've created.

1:32:54.086 --> 1:32:57.487
For the hope there might exist
on earth some corner of this paradise...

1:32:57.689 --> 1:32:58.986
Paradise?

1:32:59.758 --> 1:33:01.350
When 56,000 have fallen?

1:33:01.693 --> 1:33:02.717
You say this.

1:33:02.928 --> 1:33:03.895
You...

1:33:04.529 --> 1:33:07.726
...who fill your home with feast
and dance while Venice suffers?

1:33:07.933 --> 1:33:10.424
Who creates a sumptuous
world of flesh...

1:33:10.635 --> 1:33:13.536
...and depravity, of orgiastic rites
invoking the devil?

1:33:13.738 --> 1:33:16.172
- This is paradise?
- The only devilry here is your spite!

1:33:16.875 --> 1:33:18.672
He's jealous of what he cannot have!

1:33:18.844 --> 1:33:20.812
Do not intrude into the proceedings.

1:33:21.012 --> 1:33:24.243
I'm a senator of Venice.
The Inquisition is here by our consent.

1:33:24.483 --> 1:33:28.044
This is an ecclesiastical court.
You are here by my consent.

1:33:28.286 --> 1:33:29.878
This is a personal vendetta.

1:33:30.122 --> 1:33:32.488
You will abide by our rules
or be removed.

1:33:32.691 --> 1:33:34.022
Is that understood?

1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:37.391
Is that understood?

1:33:46.671 --> 1:33:48.696
The senator speaks the truth.

1:33:49.808 --> 1:33:51.207
I was bewitched by her.

1:33:55.580 --> 1:33:59.744
In my weakness, I fell under her spell
to pathetic ruin.

1:33:59.985 --> 1:34:02.647
It's only by the grace of God
I stand here today.

1:34:03.421 --> 1:34:04.547
I didn't seek your love.

1:34:04.756 --> 1:34:07.281
Because I could not pay your fee.

1:34:08.059 --> 1:34:09.219
I loved another.

1:34:09.594 --> 1:34:10.856
In other words...

1:34:11.062 --> 1:34:13.929
...you cast your spell over all
who cross your path.

1:34:14.166 --> 1:34:19.069
You compel sacred love to garner riches.
What is this if not witchcraft?

1:34:20.038 --> 1:34:22.165
Ever give yourself to a man
who couldn't pay?

1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:24.738
I gave my heart where
riches were no use.

1:34:24.910 --> 1:34:26.377
I did what was needed to live.

1:34:26.611 --> 1:34:29.045
Did you give yourself
to a man who could not pay?

1:34:29.247 --> 1:34:33.843
What other profession do you allow me?
How shall I survive if I cannot marry?

1:34:34.085 --> 1:34:35.143
Answer!

1:34:35.387 --> 1:34:37.855
Why, when you are determined to damn me?

1:34:40.091 --> 1:34:41.149
Look at her.

1:34:42.260 --> 1:34:43.227
Feel her wrath...

1:34:45.864 --> 1:34:50.301
She, who lures the noble fathers
of Venice from their wives...

1:34:50.569 --> 1:34:51.729
...their children...

1:34:52.370 --> 1:34:54.201
...their ability to lead the republic!

1:34:54.573 --> 1:34:58.532
It is she and her kind who turned
God's hands against us, Your Grace.

1:34:58.777 --> 1:35:00.108
Your Grace...

1:35:00.579 --> 1:35:01.705
...we must do our duty.

1:35:03.215 --> 1:35:07.345
Veronica Franco, you hover at the brink
of extermination and hell.

1:35:08.053 --> 1:35:12.251
You will return tomorrow to hear God's
merciful judgment and, I hope...

1:35:13.124 --> 1:35:16.582
...to repent before that judgment
takes its course.

1:35:17.329 --> 1:35:18.796
Remove the prisoner.

1:35:59.304 --> 1:36:00.703
You must save yourself.

1:36:01.773 --> 1:36:02.637
How?

1:36:02.974 --> 1:36:06.068
Confess whatever foolishness
they put before you...

1:36:06.611 --> 1:36:07.578
That I'm a witch?

1:36:07.746 --> 1:36:09.270
What does it matter what you say?

1:36:09.547 --> 1:36:11.412
I would be saying it.

1:36:12.183 --> 1:36:14.811
There is no honor with fools like these.

1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:16.651
God will forgive you.

1:36:18.623 --> 1:36:21.717
If I give them my lie,
I give them my soul.

1:36:22.327 --> 1:36:24.761
I'll lose everything I ever was.

1:36:25.330 --> 1:36:27.230
My love, my words, my heart.

1:36:27.432 --> 1:36:28.490
But you would live.

1:36:30.001 --> 1:36:31.593
As someone else.

1:36:32.003 --> 1:36:34.972
I've let you go too many times.

1:36:35.774 --> 1:36:37.002
I can't do it again.

1:36:38.843 --> 1:36:40.640
There is no choice.

1:36:50.021 --> 1:36:51.386
I'll never see you again.

1:37:27.759 --> 1:37:31.525
Veronica Franco, you have been
denounced a sorceress.

1:37:32.697 --> 1:37:36.997
Either confess and plead mercy,
or stand to receive my judgment.

1:37:39.170 --> 1:37:40.797
I will confess, Your Grace.

1:37:47.579 --> 1:37:49.706
That will please God.

1:37:50.248 --> 1:37:51.078
Proceed.

1:37:52.917 --> 1:37:54.384
I confess...

1:37:54.586 --> 1:37:58.352
...as a girl I loved a man who would not
marry me for want of a dowry.

1:37:59.724 --> 1:38:03.091
I confess I had a mother
who taught me a different way of life.

1:38:03.762 --> 1:38:06.128
One I resisted at first
but learned to embrace.

1:38:07.098 --> 1:38:09.566
I confess I became a courtesan.

1:38:09.768 --> 1:38:13.704
Traded yearning for power, welcomed many
rather than be owned by one.

1:38:13.872 --> 1:38:15.737
She does not speak to the charge.

1:38:15.907 --> 1:38:20.037
I confess I embraced a whore's freedom
over a wife's obedience.

1:38:20.278 --> 1:38:22.246
This is not repentance.

1:38:22.947 --> 1:38:24.414
What am I to do?

1:38:24.682 --> 1:38:27.480
I must confess my evil.
These are my sins.

1:38:27.886 --> 1:38:31.083
Your Grace, her mortal sins
are not at issue.

1:38:31.389 --> 1:38:33.152
She must repent witchcraft.

1:38:33.558 --> 1:38:36.026
Perhaps she heads in that direction.

1:38:36.294 --> 1:38:37.420
You have been warned.

1:38:37.695 --> 1:38:42.189
The Church cannot deny her right to seek
God's mercy. Confession is sacrosanct.

1:38:42.801 --> 1:38:44.860
Don't instruct me on the Church's laws!

1:38:45.136 --> 1:38:49.436
Then I call upon the doge to demand
that the Inquisition abide by them.

1:38:51.142 --> 1:38:55.078
If Christian mercy is gone, then
at least Venetian justice still exists.

1:38:55.447 --> 1:38:58.280
I pray Your Grace has heard
enough of this.

1:39:01.419 --> 1:39:05.856
It does seem odd that the Holy Mother
Church would deny a sinner confession.

1:39:06.491 --> 1:39:08.823
I see no harm in hearing her.

1:39:09.761 --> 1:39:11.888
She will save or damn herself.

1:39:12.130 --> 1:39:14.621
The prisoner has already damned herself.

1:39:15.166 --> 1:39:18.966
But if it pleases the
esteemed doge of Venice...

1:39:19.170 --> 1:39:20.762
...she may continue her heresy.

1:39:26.845 --> 1:39:30.781
I confess I find more ecstasy
in passion than in prayer.

1:39:38.122 --> 1:39:39.646
I confess...

1:39:40.358 --> 1:39:42.826
I confess I pray still...

1:39:43.862 --> 1:39:46.626
...to feel the touch
of my lover's lips...

1:39:47.365 --> 1:39:49.424
...his hands upon me...

1:39:51.236 --> 1:39:52.999
...his arms enfolding me.

1:39:53.204 --> 1:39:54.296
Veronica, stop!

1:39:55.206 --> 1:39:57.106
Save yourself, please.

1:39:59.244 --> 1:40:02.213
Such surrender has been mine.

1:40:04.249 --> 1:40:08.709
I confess I hunger still
to be filled and inflamed.

1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:11.420
To melt into the dream of us...

1:40:12.357 --> 1:40:14.086
...beyond this troubled place...

1:40:16.928 --> 1:40:18.896
...to where we are not even ourselves.

1:40:19.864 --> 1:40:21.889
To know that always...

1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:24.534
...always this is mine.

1:40:25.136 --> 1:40:26.535
Your Grace...

1:40:27.038 --> 1:40:28.733
...is this necessary?

1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:30.940
She hopes to bewitch us all.

1:40:31.376 --> 1:40:35.745
If this had not been mine,
if I had lived another way...

1:40:36.114 --> 1:40:38.048
...a child to a husband's whim...

1:40:38.383 --> 1:40:41.284
...my soul hardened from lack of touch
and lack of love...

1:40:41.619 --> 1:40:43.985
...I confess such endless days
and nights...

1:40:44.188 --> 1:40:47.021
...would be punishment greater
than any you could mete out.

1:40:47.225 --> 1:40:47.919
Finished?

1:40:48.459 --> 1:40:49.858
No, Your Grace.

1:40:51.296 --> 1:40:52.524
You, all of you...

1:40:54.465 --> 1:40:59.402
...who hunger for what I give but cannot
bear to see such power in a woman...

1:41:01.306 --> 1:41:04.139
...you call God's greatest gift...

1:41:05.743 --> 1:41:07.370
...ourselves...

1:41:07.645 --> 1:41:11.081
...our yearning, our need to love,
you call it filth...

1:41:11.316 --> 1:41:12.749
...and sin and heresy...

1:41:13.017 --> 1:41:17.420
Enough. One last time before you are
condemned: Do you repent or not?

1:41:18.489 --> 1:41:22.949
I repent there was no other way
open to me. I do not repent my life.

1:41:23.194 --> 1:41:27.893
Then the Holy Inquisition has heard the
evidence against you and is satisfied.

1:41:28.566 --> 1:41:30.033
In the name of the pope...

1:41:31.269 --> 1:41:32.736
There is more to be heard.

1:41:33.705 --> 1:41:35.434
I demand the same rights of confession!

1:41:35.673 --> 1:41:36.640
You're not on trial!

1:41:36.808 --> 1:41:40.369
We're still on consecrated ground.
I confess I am her accomplice.

1:41:43.348 --> 1:41:47.876
If she is a witch, damn me. I do not
repent. I will not live without her.

1:41:53.358 --> 1:41:55.952
This is a cynical trick.
He does this to save her.

1:41:56.194 --> 1:41:57.491
She's a witch!

1:41:58.363 --> 1:42:00.456
Proven and convicted,
the devil in our midst...

1:42:00.698 --> 1:42:04.134
...and I am her accomplice!
Condemn her if you will...

1:42:04.335 --> 1:42:07.270
...but arrest me too. Arrest a senator
of Venice for witchcraft.

1:42:07.472 --> 1:42:09.440
I'll not shrink
from judging the mighty.

1:42:09.641 --> 1:42:11.666
I welcome it. I wait for the shackles.

1:42:11.909 --> 1:42:13.604
He speaks with his heart,
not his head.

1:42:14.512 --> 1:42:16.343
He's blinded by his own lust.

1:42:16.547 --> 1:42:18.811
If she's a witch,
so is every woman in Venice!

1:42:23.821 --> 1:42:25.288
Silence!

1:42:32.930 --> 1:42:34.864
We are a strange city,
Your Holiness.

1:42:36.300 --> 1:42:38.029
Perhaps accursed.

1:42:47.111 --> 1:42:49.807
And perhaps we live
in a peculiar state of grace.

1:42:51.282 --> 1:42:53.443
I am not alone...

1:42:53.951 --> 1:42:56.010
...in loving this woman...

1:42:56.287 --> 1:42:59.313
...though I love her far, far more
than they.

1:43:02.060 --> 1:43:03.186
...were many...

1:43:04.562 --> 1:43:05.961
...and proud.

1:43:06.764 --> 1:43:08.732
If we do not speak now...

1:43:10.635 --> 1:43:12.000
...if Venice...

1:43:12.203 --> 1:43:16.799
...does not stand up now and acknowledge
who she is, then we are all damned...

1:43:17.642 --> 1:43:18.734
...not before this court...

1:43:20.378 --> 1:43:21.675
...before eternity.

1:43:23.715 --> 1:43:25.808
If what he says is true...

1:43:27.218 --> 1:43:30.051
...then you must speak the names
of your accomplices.

1:43:31.789 --> 1:43:33.154
Your Grace...

1:43:34.292 --> 1:43:36.692
...the men who loved her
were under her spell.

1:43:36.861 --> 1:43:38.488
They had no volition.

1:43:38.730 --> 1:43:41.164
Shall we punish
even the victims of her evil?

1:43:42.767 --> 1:43:45.258
If the soul of the city is corrupt...

1:43:45.636 --> 1:43:48.696
...and you help me root it out,
I will spare your life.

1:43:55.947 --> 1:43:58.438
I had no accomplices, Your Grace.

1:44:03.821 --> 1:44:04.719
Stand.

1:44:08.426 --> 1:44:09.484
Stand!

1:44:11.796 --> 1:44:12.888
Stand...

1:44:13.164 --> 1:44:15.894
...all you who defiled
your sacred marriage beds...

1:44:16.167 --> 1:44:18.567
...and declare your sin.
Stand up...

1:44:18.770 --> 1:44:19.862
...with me...

1:44:20.138 --> 1:44:22.971
...as we stood against
our enemies at sea!

1:44:33.684 --> 1:44:34.708
There.

1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:37.478
You see, Your Grace...

1:44:38.489 --> 1:44:40.787
...there are no accomplices.

1:44:40.992 --> 1:44:43.654
He does this to rescue her
from your justice.

1:44:43.861 --> 1:44:48.594
Then I stand alone for Venice
and for this woman.

1:44:53.004 --> 1:44:55.097
His trial will commence tomorrow.

1:45:03.548 --> 1:45:04.674
Minister.

1:45:05.550 --> 1:45:06.710
Do you wish to speak?

1:45:09.487 --> 1:45:12.217
I repeat, do you have something
to say to this court?

1:45:14.225 --> 1:45:15.692
I am standing.

1:45:50.127 --> 1:45:51.151
Your Grace.

1:45:57.068 --> 1:45:59.195
Perhaps there's another
who'd like to stand?

1:46:13.217 --> 1:46:16.380
Perhaps we've been hasty, Your Grace.

1:46:16.921 --> 1:46:17.979
What are you doing?

1:46:18.556 --> 1:46:21.150
Witchcraft may be too harsh a charge.

1:46:28.566 --> 1:46:30.033
Is everything...

1:46:30.301 --> 1:46:31.928
...I heard about this city true?

1:46:32.770 --> 1:46:37.298
Surely the Holy Inquisition need not
sully its hands with a common whore.

1:46:38.910 --> 1:46:42.175
This is a matter for the state,
don't you think?

1:46:57.261 --> 1:46:58.728
I leave this woman to Venice...

1:47:01.265 --> 1:47:03.062
...which richly deserves her.
