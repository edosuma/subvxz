Oh, and there's something
I've been meaning

12:38.627 --> 12:41.064
to ask you...What's that?

12:41.108 --> 12:43.284
If you could train
those dogs to attack,

12:43.327 --> 12:44.894
why can't you train them
to like me?

12:44.938 --> 12:47.767
They're animals, Magnum.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.638
There's only so much
they can do.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.600
Magnum, we've been tracking
this cat for over an hour.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.124
This is absurd.

12:57.167 --> 13:00.692
Higgins, when tailing a
subject, it requires patience.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.565
Magnum, please tell me
you consulted a veterinarian

13:03.608 --> 13:06.481
as to whether your furry friend
had a microchip implant.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.526
Microchip?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.311
HIGGINS:
They place them underneath
the skin of the animal

13:10.354 --> 13:11.921
to identify the owner.
You knew that.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.097
Didn't you?Oh-- check it out--

13:14.141 --> 13:16.143
this could be
the place.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.759
[meows]

13:27.589 --> 13:31.158
Hello?

13:31.201 --> 13:32.986
Anybody home?

13:34.030 --> 13:36.816
We found your cat.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.604
Oh, God.

13:46.651 --> 13:47.609
Not necessary,

13:47.652 --> 13:50.481
Magnum.He could still be alive.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.527
Not a chap that perforated.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.771
[door opens][grunting]

14:19.815 --> 14:21.904
HIGGINS:
Magnum!

15:03.032 --> 15:05.600
[groans]

15:13.825 --> 15:15.958
[groans]Oh, come on. It's
three broken ribs.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.655
Man up.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.048
Can you give us a minute,
please? Thank you.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.269
Just so you know, the woman
who was driving the car

15:22.312 --> 15:24.836
is traumatized.
They had to sedate her.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.014
Oh, no, thanks for your concern,
but really, I'm fine.

15:28.057 --> 15:31.756
So, what's this
about a homicide?Well,

15:31.800 --> 15:33.758
me and Higgins were surveilling
a house for a case,

15:33.802 --> 15:35.847
and, uh, came across
a dead body.

15:35.891 --> 15:36.848
Where?

15:36.892 --> 15:38.285
House in Waianae.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.677
Somebody was
fleeing the scene,

15:39.721 --> 15:41.941
I went after him,
and that's when I got tagged.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.160
Get yourself discharged,

15:44.204 --> 15:46.293
then you're gonna
take me to this body.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.338
[police radio chatter]

Clear.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.571
You have got to be

16:03.614 --> 16:04.659
kidding me.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.008
Sure you got
the right place?

16:06.052 --> 16:07.749
Without question.100%.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.273
Well, then,
congratulations, Magnum.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.927
You found
a really clean house.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.886
Let's talk about the guy
you chased down.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.062
What'd he look like?

16:16.105 --> 16:18.151
[sighs]
White male.

16:18.194 --> 16:21.502
30s. Uh, dark hair.
Athletic.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.852
Unfortunately, we only
really saw him from behind.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.462
And you said
you were working a case.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.073
How exactly did you end up here?

16:29.162 --> 16:31.381
Uh, well, I was, uh...

16:31.425 --> 16:33.470
I was hired to find a cat,
and...

16:33.514 --> 16:35.907
[laughs]:
I-I'm sorry, a cat?

16:36.604 --> 16:37.648
Is he serious?

16:37.692 --> 16:39.128
Sadly, yes.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.783
Anyway, I found the cat.
It was the wrong one.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.306
This one had blood on it.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.743
We tracked the cat back
here, we found the body.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.658
Figured the cat came in contact
with the body at some point.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.051
And where's
your furry witness now?

16:49.095 --> 16:51.358
Oh, um...

16:52.533 --> 16:53.795
It's a few miles away from here.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.536
MAGNUM: I'll ask Rick
and TC to pick it up.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.017
[phone rings][sighs] Katsumoto.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.063
All right.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.109
All right. Mahalo.
So, the house

17:03.152 --> 17:05.981
is owned by a company on
the mainland, used by employees

17:06.025 --> 17:07.635
when they're on vacation.
But,

17:07.678 --> 17:09.811
according to them,
it's supposed to be empty.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.509
Wasn't a couple hours ago.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.820
Maybe you stumbled onto a
thief robbing the place.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.691
That could be the
person you chased.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.172
Maybe.
What about the body?

17:23.216 --> 17:24.739
Somebody came in here

17:24.782 --> 17:27.394
and scrubbed the crime scene.
That is the only explanation.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.658
Get someone down here
to tape it up.

17:30.701 --> 17:31.833
It's now a crime scene.

17:31.876 --> 17:34.009
I'll get CSU to process

17:34.053 --> 17:36.185
when they can.
But do me a favor, Magnum--

17:36.229 --> 17:38.100
the next time you see
a dead body on the ground,

17:38.144 --> 17:39.580
take a picture of it.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.887
Or maybe he could just drop it
on your desk.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.413
You'll keep us
in the loop, right?

17:46.456 --> 17:48.067
Don't you have a cat to find?

17:48.110 --> 17:50.112
Just do your job.
Let us do ours.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.506
And don't go back in there or
I'll arrest you for trespassing.

17:52.549 --> 17:55.030
[car door opens, closes]

17:55.074 --> 17:57.076

18:05.562 --> 18:08.304
Didn't you hear
what he justsaid?

18:09.349 --> 18:11.220
Did you hear
what Ijust said?

18:11.264 --> 18:13.483
Can't just sit back
and do nothing.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.311
The police are on it, Magnum.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.052
Yeah, without a body,
evidence or a suspect,

18:17.096 --> 18:19.533
this case is not going
to the top of the pile.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.144
Come on.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.668
You know you want to.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.161
[sighs]

18:39.205 --> 18:41.772
What's wrong with this house?

18:41.816 --> 18:44.949
Uh, besides the hideous decor

18:44.993 --> 18:47.256
and the fact the
dead body is gone...

18:47.300 --> 18:48.779
I could go on.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.042
But I believe you're
about to make a point?Look around.

18:51.086 --> 18:54.568
No water bowl, no food bowl,
no kitty litter.

18:54.611 --> 18:57.005
Plus, I'm not sneezing
or scratching.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.399
You're saying that cat
didn't live here?No.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.183
But it had obviously been here.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.446
Perhaps it belonged
to the victim?

19:03.490 --> 19:05.100
That's what I'm thinking, too.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.493
Well, if that's the case,

19:06.536 --> 19:09.539
then the victim
didn't live here, either.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.193
He didn't live here.
Who was he

19:11.237 --> 19:14.153
and what was he doing
in this house?

19:14.196 --> 19:15.545
♪

19:15.589 --> 19:17.243
Anything?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.463
Negatory.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.292
Maybe the tracking collar's
out of juice.Nah.

19:23.336 --> 19:26.208
I just think the cell phone
service out here is jack.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.862
Maybe we can circle back
to where we were

19:27.905 --> 19:29.733
about two hours ago?
Start over again?

19:29.777 --> 19:31.126
This is stupid.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.737
Thomas doesn't even know
if that cat is chipped.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.696
Plus, there's no guarantee
if we find it

19:35.739 --> 19:37.437
that it's gonna tell us
who the owner was.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.003
Exactly.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.180
[sighs]
Plus, I can't believe

19:41.223 --> 19:42.529
you didn't bring me a poke bowl.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.316
You know,
you could at least share.

Dude, you're driving.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.451
How you gonna use chopsticks
and steer at the same time?

19:51.494 --> 19:53.409
You could feed me.

19:53.453 --> 19:56.020
Let me find
a nice one for you.Thank you.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.197
That ain't happening.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.333
What you up to?

20:04.377 --> 20:06.248
I am in the
process of bruting

20:06.292 --> 20:09.556
the Honolulu County
property appraiser's database.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.297
I have no idea
what that means.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.212
I'm launching a series
of brute-force attacks

20:13.255 --> 20:14.778

confidential property records.

on a house.

Ah.

20:21.568 --> 20:24.571
That's the Waianae area.Yes.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.094
You know, that used to be home

20:26.137 --> 20:28.227
to several members
of The Company.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.619
Do you mean the
Hawaiian Syndicate?

20:29.663 --> 20:32.492
They controlled
criminal activities in the state

20:32.535 --> 20:35.234
from the late '60s
to the mid '90s.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.584
That area's
coming around, though.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.194
Corporations are
buying up property,

20:39.238 --> 20:41.718

down and rebuilt.

by the HPD,

tend to stay away.

No problem.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.383
What'd I do?

20:54.427 --> 20:56.385
You may have given me a lead.

MAGNUM:
While I was waiting
for Rick and TC to track down

21:01.651 --> 21:03.305
the cat with blood on it,

21:03.349 --> 21:06.395
I decided to check in
with my client.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.311
So, we have, uh, some
promising leads on Mittens.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.834
But, in the meantime,

21:10.878 --> 21:13.228
I wanted to give you this.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.274
What do you say?

21:15.317 --> 21:16.275
Thank you.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.972
You're welcome.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.326
Hey.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.545
Cecilia,

21:25.588 --> 21:28.548
you know, um,
when I was a kid,

21:28.591 --> 21:30.332
my uncle had this parrot.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.638
And his name was Buddy.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.379
And I-I loved this bird.

21:33.422 --> 21:36.991
Anyway, Buddy used to sit
on my uncle's shoulder,

21:37.034 --> 21:38.819
like, every morning
when he read the paper,

21:38.862 --> 21:40.342
like... kind of like
he was reading, too.

21:40.386 --> 21:43.911
And then one day, Buddy
flew out the kitchen window,

21:43.954 --> 21:47.349
and-and we were all heartbroken.

21:47.393 --> 21:50.700
We thought Buddy was
definitely gone for good.

21:50.744 --> 21:53.703
And then one morning, he flew
back in the kitchen window,

21:53.747 --> 21:55.705
landed on my uncle's shoulder

21:55.749 --> 21:57.881
like-like he never left.

21:59.361 --> 22:02.321
What I'm saying is that...

22:02.364 --> 22:05.280
Buddy, you know,
he wanted to get out there

22:05.324 --> 22:08.414
and see the world, explore.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.764
But at the end of the day,

22:10.807 --> 22:12.766
Buddy knew where his home was.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.812
And I know

22:15.856 --> 22:17.901
that Mittens knows
where his home is.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.121
And I'm telling you,

22:20.164 --> 22:22.384
he's gonna be back.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.472
'Kay?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.263

22:32.307 --> 22:33.569
you're a natural with kids.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.397
You ever think

22:35.441 --> 22:36.442
of having one of your own?

22:36.485 --> 22:39.706
I came close, once,

22:39.749 --> 22:42.230
to finding someone I
wanted to have kids with.

22:42.273 --> 22:45.189
But, uh...

22:45.233 --> 22:47.017
didn't work out.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.019
What happened?

22:49.063 --> 22:51.326
If-if you don't mind me asking.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.416
It's complicated.

22:58.072 --> 22:59.160
She just, uh...

22:59.203 --> 23:01.554
You know, she wasn't...

23:01.597 --> 23:04.426
wasn't the person
I thought she was.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.126
[sound of dogs barking]

23:09.170 --> 23:10.563
I'm sorry.

23:10.606 --> 23:11.781
I got to take this.
Can you...

23:11.825 --> 23:14.001
tell Cecilia
I'll text her later?

23:14.044 --> 23:15.611
Okay.Thank you.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.398
Higgins.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.401
Got some information on the
house where we found the body.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.925
It seems it was once owned
by the mob,

23:24.968 --> 23:26.927
until it was seized
by the feds back in the day.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.538
The title is now held
by what I believe to be

23:29.582 --> 23:31.888
an FBI shell company,
which leads me to think

23:31.932 --> 23:34.369
it could very well be
a safe house.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.458
Well, if you're right,
then it could be a hit,

23:36.502 --> 23:37.938
and maybe the dead guy's
an informant

23:37.981 --> 23:39.592
or a-a witness in a case.

23:39.635 --> 23:40.810
Possibly.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.856
And the fact
that the house was sanitized

23:42.899 --> 23:44.945
less than two hours
after the murder means

23:44.988 --> 23:46.947
we're dealing with something
very high-stakes.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.557
[beeping]Hey, Higgins, I...

38:01.017 --> 38:02.976
you couldn't finish the job.

38:03.019 --> 38:05.152
Now, try telling that
to a little girl

38:05.195 --> 38:07.720
who lost her pet.

38:21.734 --> 38:22.735
It worked.

38:22.778 --> 38:24.650
[stammers]
What worked?

38:24.693 --> 38:25.955
Leaving the window open.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.435
Mittens came back.[laughs]

38:30.177 --> 38:33.963
50 cents for two days work.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.704
Thank you very much.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.053
[chuckles]

38:37.097 --> 38:39.099
Oh.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.189
[Mittens meows]

38:44.104 --> 38:46.062
Thank you for being so gracious.

38:46.106 --> 38:48.935
Well, you know, it's easy,
with a client like that.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.937
Plus, I got, uh...

38:50.980 --> 38:53.113
got paid in full,
which doesn't always happen.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.860
Uh...

39:00.903 --> 39:03.950
do want to grab coffee
sometime, maybe?

39:03.993 --> 39:06.169
I'd love to.

39:06.213 --> 39:07.954
Great.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.129
But...

39:09.172 --> 39:12.001
Oh, not the "but."

39:12.045 --> 39:14.003
I would really love to, Thomas.

39:14.047 --> 39:16.789
I think there's someone
you need to get over first.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.749
Yeah.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.795
I'm working on that.

39:23.839 --> 39:26.015
Well, just know...

39:26.059 --> 39:29.105
when you feel the time is right,

39:29.149 --> 39:30.150
call me.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.806
I'll do that.

39:34.633 --> 39:37.244
Good-bye, Isabelle.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.899
Good-bye.

39:50.039 --> 39:51.476
Oh...

39:51.519 --> 39:52.651
Look out!

39:52.694 --> 39:54.870
[growling]That's enough, lads.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.743
Magnum, you ever play
'ula maika?

39:57.786 --> 39:59.571
Can't say that I have.You are welcome

39:59.614 --> 40:01.703
to join us.No, I've actually
got big plans.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.879
I'm going to bed.
Since you woke me up

40:03.923 --> 40:06.186
two days ago,
I've barely had any sleep.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.710
E kala mai i a u.
That was my fault.No, no.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.756
It was me who asked Kumu
to get your shirt.

40:10.799 --> 40:11.670
Oh, um,

40:11.713 --> 40:13.062
on that note...Yes, Magnum.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.063
I promised you a replacement.

40:14.107 --> 40:15.369
I haven't forgotten.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.718
Is that why
you're here?

40:16.762 --> 40:18.851
No. I actually wanted to say

40:18.894 --> 40:20.896
that I appreciate
your help today.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.725
Is that all?

40:24.813 --> 40:25.771
Girl, they broke the mold

40:25.814 --> 40:26.989
after they made you.

40:27.033 --> 40:28.687
Is there anything else?Well,

40:28.730 --> 40:30.993
I saved your life.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.691
[laughing]: Technically,
I saved my own life.

40:32.734 --> 40:35.433
Yes, but...
technically,

40:35.476 --> 40:38.305
you'd still be out at sea,
dehydrated and delirious

40:38.348 --> 40:40.002
from sunstroke had I not
called your friends.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.527
I should wear a referee whistle
when I'm with you two.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.920
Okay, thank you, Higgins,
for calling TC

40:44.964 --> 40:46.444
and finding me before

40:46.487 --> 40:48.707
the coast guard did.
Enjoy your game.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.230
Pleasant dreams, Magnum.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.797
Hope you win, Kumu.
