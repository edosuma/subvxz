WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.915
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.959 --> 00:06.136
SHEIDHEDA: I ASK ONLY
THAT YOU TAKE A KNEE
TO SHOW YOUR LOYALTY.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.616
NIKKI: THE KILLERS
AND THE THIEVES
ARE AT YOUR SERVICE.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.357
EMORI: IF YOU TRY TO
COME IN HERE,

00:09.400 --> 00:10.793
I BLOW THE REACTOR.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.447
SHEIDHEDA: STAY HERE,
WAIT THEM OUT.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.362
WHEN THE DOOR OPENS,
KILL THEM ALL.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.364
CADOGAN: SHE HAS THE KEY.
CLARKE: THE KEY'S THE FLAME.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.192
IS MY DAUGHTER
IN THE KEY?

00:18.235 --> 00:20.498
IF I CAN GET THE FLAME,
YOU CAN FIND OUT.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.805
BELLAMY: MY SHEPHERD,
CLARKE DOESN'T HAVE THE KEY.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.242
ALL OF YOU WILL DIE
IF I DON'T GIVE HIM
THE FLAME.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.635
I'LL TAKE YOU TO IT.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.733
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

00:44.087 --> 00:45.654
GABRIEL: RUSSELL.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.963
HEH. WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

00:51.007 --> 00:53.749
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.272
HEH.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.059
THAT'S NOT RUSSELL.

00:59.102 --> 01:02.540
MAN: THIS IS MALACHI
KOM SANGEDAKRU,

01:02.584 --> 01:04.716
AND YOU WILL KNEEL
BEFORE HIM.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.632
WELL, I GUESS WE
FOUND SHEIDHEDA'S CODE.

01:07.676 --> 01:10.505
SHEIDHEDA: SINCE MY ASCENSION,
THE PROTOCOL HAS BECOME

01:10.548 --> 01:12.376
RATHER SIMPLE REALLY.

01:12.420 --> 01:17.599
KNEEL...OR DIE.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.731
ORDINARILY,

01:19.775 --> 01:21.907
I WOULD RELISH
THE OPPORTUNITY

01:21.951 --> 01:23.822
TO RECRUIT YOUR FORCES
TO THE CAUSE,

01:23.866 --> 01:25.911
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
I HAVE NEITHER THE TIME

01:25.955 --> 01:28.784
NOR PATIENCE TO SUFFER
YOUR PRIMITIVE TRIBALISM.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.277
RAVEN: MURPHY!

01:48.369 --> 01:51.415
INVISIBILITY AND RAY GUNS
I CAN ACCEPT.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.812
THAT NEEDS SOME
EXPLAINING, THOUGH.

01:58.074 --> 02:00.772
TELL ME MADI'S SAFE
WITH GAIA.

02:00.816 --> 02:04.167
WE THOUGHT GAIA
WAS WITH YU.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.430
MADI'S SAFE FOR NOW.

02:06.474 --> 02:09.477
RESTRAIN THE SOLDIER WITH HIM.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.043
CLARKE: NO.
MURPHY: HEY, HEY.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.045
CLARKE: SHE'S WITH US.
DISCIPLE: LET'S GO.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.004
CADOGAN: SHE WAS
STANDING UNRESTRAINED
BY THE THRONE.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.832
THE ONLY REASON SHE
IS NOT DEAD IS
SHE WAS UNARMED.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.660
RAAH! UGH!

02:20.879 --> 02:24.883
AGH! UGH! UNH.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.495
CADOGAN: THE MICROPHONE.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.022
THAT WOUND IS DEEP.

02:34.023 --> 02:37.766
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN REMOVING YOU
FROM YOUR THRONE.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.162
HERE'S MY PROPOSAL.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.295
YOU GIVE ME
UNDISTURBED PASSAGE

02:45.339 --> 02:47.079
TO GET WHAT
I CAME FOR.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.821
THAT MEANS I SEE
NOT A SINGLE SOUL
ON OUR PATH,

02:49.865 --> 02:54.478
AND I LEAVE
DR. SANTIAGO HERE
TO TREAT YOU.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.698
WHEN WE'RE GONE,
YOU'RE FREE TO CONTINUE

02:56.741 --> 02:58.961
THE DEBASEMENT
OF OUR SPECIES

02:59.004 --> 03:01.181
UNTIL YOU'RE SAVED
LIKE THE REST
OF HUMANITY

03:01.224 --> 03:03.226
BY THE COMPLETION
OF MY QUEST.

03:08.623 --> 03:10.277
REFUSE THIS,
AND YOU DIE.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.758
RIGHT THEN.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.807
ONWARD TO THE KEY.

04:00.370 --> 04:03.721
THAT'S RUSSELL PRIME'S DOG,
NOT YOURS.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.810
HE WOULDN'T WANT
A COG PETTING HER.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.778
COME ON. YOU KNOW YOU
WANT TO PET HER.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.788
I BET SHE'S HUNGRY, TOO.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.359
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.243
EVERYONE'S HUNGRY.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.984
HOW IS JACKSON GONNA
GET OUR RATIONS

04:49.027 --> 04:50.638
PAST THAT?

04:52.466 --> 04:54.946
JEREMIAH: JOHN MURPHY
WILL THINK OF SOMETHING.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.340
WE'RE SAFE NOW
BECAUSE OF HIM.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.994
I HAVE FAITH.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.087
NO OFFENSE,

05:05.130 --> 05:08.482
BUT IF OUR LIVES
REALLY DO DEPEND
ON MURPHY,

05:08.525 --> 05:09.961
WE'RE SCREWED.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.528
HEH.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.667
SHEIDHEDA, ON P.A.:
AND I REPEAT, ANYONE...

05:19.710 --> 05:21.799
CADOGAN: A FIRE-BURNED CASTLE
SURROUNDED

05:21.843 --> 05:23.932
BY A CITY
OF GARBAGE DUMPSTERS...

05:23.975 --> 05:27.327
SHEIDHEDA: LIKE TO AVOID THAT,
STAY OUT OF SIGHT...

05:27.370 --> 05:30.765
CADOGAN: EVERYWHERE
HUMAN BEINGS GO IS
WORSE OFF FOR IT,

05:30.808 --> 05:33.115
BUT THANKS TO US,
WE WILL TRANSCEND.

05:33.158 --> 05:36.466
THANKS TO US, WE WILL
REACH THE PROMISED LAND.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.381
CLARKE: OH,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.694
HEY. SO WHAT'S
OUR PLAY HERE?

05:46.737 --> 05:48.652
-OUR PLAY?
-DON'T GET ME WRONG.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.611
YOU LOOK GOOD,
NOT AS GOOD AS ME,

05:50.654 --> 05:52.395
BUT I KNOW A THING OR TWO
ABOUT PRETENDING TO BE

05:52.439 --> 05:54.223
SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.877
THIS ISN'T AN ACT,
MURPHY.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.792
I'M TRYING TO
SAVE US ALL.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.620
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

05:59.663 --> 06:02.666
JUST KNOW THAT
I AM YOUR FRIEND

06:02.710 --> 06:04.668
AND I'M LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.191
THAT'S VERY REASSURING.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.368
I'M JUST GONNA...

06:16.201 --> 06:18.203
TELL ME HE'S
NOT SERIOUS.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.814
WELCOME TO THE PARTY.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.120
YEAH. NOT GONNA LIE.
FEELING A LITTLE
OUT OF THE LOOP.

06:22.164 --> 06:25.733
MUTUAL. YOU SAID THAT
MADI WAS SAFE FOR NOW.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.343
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.432
SHE'S SAFE.
SHE'S WITH EMORI...

06:29.476 --> 06:31.347
IN THE REACTOR.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.871
I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

06:33.915 --> 06:35.699
IT WAS THE SAFEST PLACE
IN SANCTUM.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.223
WHAT THE HELL'S BEEN
GOING ON HERE?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.834
CADOGAN: HOLD.

06:41.096 --> 06:44.752
CLARKE: LOOK. I'M IN A HURRY.
YOU HAVE OUR FRIENDS.

06:44.795 --> 06:48.669
I WOULD LIKE THEM BACK,
THEN TO SEE MY DAUGHTER.

06:48.712 --> 06:52.194
IF YOU WANT TO SEE YOURS,
THE FLAME IS THIS WAY.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.326
CADOGAN: NEW PLAN.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.416
YOU GO.
WE'LL STAY HERE.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.939
BELLAMY: SIR,
YOU HEARD HER.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.854
AS LONG AS
OUR FRIENDS
ARE OUT THERE,

06:59.897 --> 07:02.552
SHE WON'T RISK
THEIR LIVES.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.772
THAT'S WHY THESE TWO
ARE STAYING WITH US.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.863
HURRY ALONG, CLARKE.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.517
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ON THIS INFERNAL MOON

07:10.560 --> 07:12.823
A MOMENT LONGER
THAN I HAVE TO.

07:19.961 --> 07:23.399
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
WAIT IN THE TAVERN INSTEAD?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.749
OY! OHH! WHAT THE HELL?

07:25.793 --> 07:27.925
-YOU GET USED TO IT.
-YEAH?

07:29.274 --> 07:30.537
COME.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.759
CADOGAN: I LIKE THIS SPOT.
HIGH GROUND.

07:35.803 --> 07:38.458
SO SHEIDHEDA'S ALIVE,

07:38.501 --> 07:42.200
AND MADI'S
IN A NUCLEAR REACTOR?

07:42.244 --> 07:44.812
YOU DID GOOD.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.596
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS
ARE MISSING,

07:46.640 --> 07:49.294
AND BELLAMY IS A SHEEP.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.035
SO DID YOU.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.261
MAN: GIVE ME A HAND.

07:59.304 --> 08:01.350
WOMAN: BE HAPPY YOU
DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN
UP THE BLOOD.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.178
GABRIEL: YOU KNOW, IF
THE BLADE HIT YOUR KIDNEY,

08:03.221 --> 08:06.877
THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT
I CAN DO FOR YOU,

08:06.921 --> 08:09.184
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
THEY WON'T TAKE YOU
TO BARDO.

08:09.227 --> 08:12.056
GOOD. IT'S TIME WE
LET HIM FIND OUT

08:12.100 --> 08:14.537
WHAT DEATH IS LIKE
A SECOND TIME.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.846
SHE'LL MISS ME
WHEN I'M GONE.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.548
DID HE SUFFER?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.550
WHO--RUSSELL?

08:27.594 --> 08:30.945
NO. IT WAS QUICK.

08:30.988 --> 08:34.514
JOSEPHINE: OH, COME ON.
LIKE YOU CARE.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.040
WHAT'S THE MATTER, GABRIEL?

08:39.083 --> 08:41.172
YOU DON'T LOOK HAPPY
TO SEE ME.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.827
NO.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.177
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT NOW.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.005
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:48.049 --> 08:49.833
DON'T TELL THEM.
JUST SAY YOU NEED

08:49.877 --> 08:51.313
BAND-AIDS OR SOMETHING
FOR WHOEVER'S WEARING

08:51.356 --> 08:53.750
DADDY'S LAST BODY
SO WE CAN BE ALONE.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.405
WE NEED ANTITOXIN.
THE SUNS ARE ECLIPSING.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.015
OH, FOR PRIME'S SAKE.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.104
WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
THE TREES RELEASE
A TOXIN THAT--

09:00.148 --> 09:02.106
INDRA: THAT DRIVES
EVERYTHING MAD.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.325
I'M AWARE.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.762
IT'S NIGHTTIME.
THERE ARE NO SUNS.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.372
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

09:07.416 --> 09:11.028
BECAUSE THE RED SUN PAINTS
THE PLANET WE'RE ORBITING.

09:11.072 --> 09:13.074
BECAUSE I'M ALREADY
FEELING THE EFFECTS.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.303
SO JUST TO RECAP.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.828
THE SHEPHERD
OVER THERE IS
THE SAME GUY

09:27.871 --> 09:33.224
WHO BUILT THE BUNKER
THAT SAVED HUMANITY
FROM PRAIMFAYA TWICE,

09:33.268 --> 09:36.184
AND NOW HE WANTS
THE FLAME, BROKEN
BY YOU,

09:36.227 --> 09:38.665
SO HE CAN START
A WAR WITH...

09:38.708 --> 09:40.362
WHOEVER BUILT
THE STONES

09:40.405 --> 09:44.671
IN ORDER TO TURN
ALL OF US INTO...

09:44.714 --> 09:47.587
BEINGS OF LIGHT.

09:47.630 --> 09:51.416
-YEP.
-AH.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.636
IS IT WEIRD THAT TO ME
THE CRAZIEST PART

09:53.680 --> 09:56.987
OF ALL OF THIS
IS BELLAMY'S ROBE?

09:57.031 --> 09:58.728
NOPE.

09:58.772 --> 10:02.123
ECHO AND OCTAVIA
ARE HOSTAGES, AND...

10:02.166 --> 10:04.038
LOOK AT HIM.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.823
YEAH. WELL, NOT TO
POINT OUT THE OBVIOUS,

10:06.867 --> 10:10.740
BUT WE'RE HOSTAGES,
TOO.

10:10.784 --> 10:13.308
YEAH, BUT SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HIM OUT THERE.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.400
CADOGAN: WHAT'S TAKING
HER SO LONG?

10:18.443 --> 10:19.967
SHE'LL BE HERE.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.885
I KNOW HOW HARD
THIS IS ON YOU, SON,

10:26.451 --> 10:28.105
BELIEVING IN SOMETHING
WITH ALL YOUR HEART

10:28.149 --> 10:31.761
THAT THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.285
YOU REMIND ME OF MYSELF
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.030
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US,
PLEASE?

10:40.074 --> 10:41.858
OF COURSE, MY SHEPHERD.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.689
DOUCETTE'S A GOOD MAN.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.735
HE'LL MAKE A FINE
REPLACEMENT FOR ANDERS...

10:50.824 --> 10:52.564
BUT HE'S NOT LIKE US.

10:52.608 --> 10:53.957
SIR?

10:54.001 --> 10:56.917
THE DISCIPLES ARE TAUGHT
OUR WAYS FROM BIRTH.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.659
THEY KNOW NOTHING ELSE.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.791
MAKES FAITH EASY.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.838
WE, ON THE OTHER HAND,
KNOW THE PULL OF LOVE

11:04.881 --> 11:06.796
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS,

11:06.840 --> 11:08.537
WHAT IT MAKES US DO,

11:08.580 --> 11:11.845
THE HIGHS AND LOWS
OF IT,

11:11.888 --> 11:16.327
HOW IT LEADS TO HATRED
OF THE OTHER, TRIBALISM.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.723
I'VE SPENT GENERATIONS
DEDICATING MY LIFE

11:20.767 --> 11:22.507
TO SOMETHING GREATER.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.161
TRANSCENDENCE.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.733
NOW YOU KNOW THE WEIGHT
OF THAT, TOO.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.344
THE PATH OF THE PROPHET
IS ALWAYS HARD.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.043
YOUR FRIENDS WILL
UNDERSTAND EVENTUALLY.

11:36.086 --> 11:39.002
YOU HAD A FAMILY.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.135
HOW DID YOU
MANAGE IT?

11:42.571 --> 11:48.751
I FEEL LIKE I'M FAILING
BOTH YOU AND THEM.

11:48.795 --> 11:52.929
YOU'RE NOT FAILING ME,
BELLAMY, FAR FROM IT.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.366
YOU'RE SPECIAL.

11:55.410 --> 11:59.457
YOU WERE GIVEN A GLIMPSE
OF WHAT COMES NEXT
JUST AS I WAS.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.765
THEY ALL THINK
I'M CRAZY.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.767
AND SO WE IGNORE
THEIR JUDGMENTS

12:04.811 --> 12:07.378
AND WE SAVE THEM ANYWAY.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.774
FOR ALL MANKIND.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.341
FOR ALL MANKIND.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.910
MAN, NO P.A.:
ATTENTION, SANCTUM.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.259
WHAT IS THIS?

12:18.302 --> 12:20.087
RED SUN TOXIN
HAS BEEN DETECTED.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.089
MAKE YOUR WAY TO YOUR ASSIGNED
LOCATION FOR EVACUATION.

12:22.132 --> 12:24.569
TIME TO PLAY ANOTHER
ROUND OF "WHO WANTS TO
MURDER YOUR FRIENDS?"

12:24.613 --> 12:26.267
SIR, WE SHOULD GET YOU
BACK TO BARDO.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.225
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITHOUT THE FLAME,

12:28.269 --> 12:30.967
AND FOR ALL WE KNOW,
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE
OF CLARKE'S TRICKS.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.013
IF IT IS,
THEN IT'S A GOOD ONE.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.975
MAN, ON P.A.:
ATTENTION, SANCTUM.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.586
RED SUN TOXIN HAS BEEN DETECTED.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.023
BUGS.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.415
MAN, ON P.A:
LOCATION FOR EVACUATION.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.983
THIS IS NOT A TEST.
GO NOW.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.898
IT'S OK. WE'RE SAFE.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.247
THE REACTOR'S AIRTIGHT.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.032
TOXIN CAN'T GET
IN HERE.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.256
WON'T BE AIRTIGHT FOR LONG.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.910
JEREMIAH: THEY'RE
CALLING OUR BLUFF.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.782
THEY KNOW WE WON'T
DETONATE THE REACTOR.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.261
MAN, ON P.A.:
ATTENTION, SANCTUM.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.658
TREY, JEREMIAH, GET
EVERYONE INTO SECONDARY

13:09.701 --> 13:12.313
AND SEAL THE DOOR. GO!

13:12.356 --> 13:14.532
YOU, TOO. WE'VE
ONLY GOT ONE GUN.

13:16.752 --> 13:20.277
-SURPRISE!
-UNH!

13:20.321 --> 13:21.583
DAD!

13:21.626 --> 13:24.325
IT'S BEEN SWELL,
BUT I THINK I'LL
BE GOING NOW.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.196
YOU'RE CUTE,
BUT I WILL KILL YOUR DADDY

13:26.240 --> 13:28.590
IF YOU DON'T STEP ASIDE.

13:28.633 --> 13:32.942
HE KNOWS WE CAN'T
LET YOU OPEN THE DOOR.

13:32.986 --> 13:36.685
EMORI: NIKKI, IT'S TRUE.
LOOK.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.343
IF THOSE MEN OPEN
THAT DOOR,

13:42.386 --> 13:45.955
RED SUN TOXIN WILL
SPILL INTO THIS REACTOR.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.827
MADI: HUMAN SHIELDS ONLY
WORK IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING

13:47.870 --> 13:50.003
TO LET THE OTHER
PERSON DIE.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.005
THE SHIELD. HERE.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.357
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

13:57.662 --> 14:00.665
STOP, OR IN 3 SECONDS,
THIS KID IS FATHERLESS.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.232
1...

14:04.278 --> 14:05.583
2...

14:11.067 --> 14:13.591
TURN ON THE DAMN LIGHTS,
OR I CUT THIS GUY--

14:26.996 --> 14:29.042
YOU LET
THE BUGS IN.

14:29.085 --> 14:32.610
YEAH. TWO BUGS
WITH ONE STONE.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.092
I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT 3.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.703
MAN: ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
COME ON. FOLLOW ME.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.531
LET'S GO!
EVERYBODY MOVE!

14:40.575 --> 14:42.577
WE SHOULD BE GOING
WITH THEM TO RYKER'S KEEP,

14:42.620 --> 14:45.188
OR MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO DROWN ME AGAIN
IN THE POND.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.625
RAVEN: POWER'S OUT.
THAT MEANS THE SHIELD'S DOWN.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.892
GUYS.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.721
WE SHOULD RUN.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.636
BELLAMY: SHE'S RIGHT.
WE SHOULD GO RIGHT NOW.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.247
NOT WITHOUT THE KEY.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.857
DOUCETTE: I AGREE
WITH BELLAMY.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.468
WE SHOULD EXECUTE
THE HOSTAGES AND GET YOU HOME.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.209
WELL, BELLAMY
NEVER SAID THAT.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.689
BELLAMY: CLARKE HEARD
THE ALARM, TOO.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.038
SHE'LL GO FOR MADI.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.910
YES, RIGHT, GOOD.
THE REACTOR.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.912
PERFECT. I'LL GET
THE POWER BACK ON
AND KILL THE BUGS.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.130
BELLAMY: BEFORE
THEY KILL US.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.915
EVERYONE
GRAB A TORCH!

15:17.090 --> 15:19.092
BELLAMY:
SIR, STAY WITH ME.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.499
HE'S THE LAST ONE.
I SENT SALINE AHEAD
TO RYKER'S.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.153
JUST MAKE SURE
THE IV STAYS IN.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.589
MAN: WILL DO.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.896
HEY. WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.593
HEY. WRONG WAY.
WE'RE EVACUATING.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.247
-IT'S OK.
-GO.

15:44.291 --> 15:48.295
JOSEPHINE: AH.
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

15:48.338 --> 15:51.037
NOT SURE HOW I FEEL
ABOUT ALL THE OLD MES

15:51.080 --> 15:53.082
BEING TURNED
INTO A CHAIR,

15:53.126 --> 15:55.955
BUT, HEY, I DO BELIEVE
IN RECYCLING.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.740
JACKSON: DR. SANTIAGO?

15:58.783 --> 16:01.525
DR. SANTIAGO, RIGHT?

16:01.569 --> 16:04.180
YOU OK?

16:04.224 --> 16:07.270
ANTITOXIN.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.099
GET HIM TO THE KEEP.
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

16:15.061 --> 16:18.281
UNH.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.892
JOSEPHINE: HMM.
JOSEPHINE II.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.633
I LIKED THAT BODY.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.595
JACKSON: WHERE ARE
THE OTHERS?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.423
-THEY WENT LOOKING FOR YOU.
-RIGHT. YEAH.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.773
THAT'S A--THAT'S
A LONG STORY,

16:31.816 --> 16:34.036
AND WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.039
JUST TELL ME
IF NATE'S OK.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.042
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THAT IS, DO YOU?

16:40.086 --> 16:41.652
NATE?

16:41.696 --> 16:43.306
MILLER.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.439
OF COURSE. YEAH.
UM, NATE'S FINE.

16:45.482 --> 16:46.353
IS HE HERE?

16:46.396 --> 16:48.529
NO, BUT HE'S SAFE.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.706
AH. THERE YOU ARE.

16:57.668 --> 16:58.800
ALMOST EMPTY.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.323
THE PRIMES USED IT
TO GET TO SPACE

17:00.367 --> 17:01.977
AFTER RUSSELL
THREW THE BOMB.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.544
ALL THE INGREDIENTS
ARE HERE.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.459
WE CAN MAKE MORE.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.678
-THIS ONE'S YOURS.
-IT'S THE ONLY DOSE,

17:07.722 --> 17:09.637
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE MORE.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.508
YOU TAKE IT.

17:11.552 --> 17:15.382
JOSEPHINE: YEAH, GABRIEL.
YOU TAKE IT.

17:19.386 --> 17:22.911
I'M USED TO WORKING
UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF THE TOXIN.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.218
YOU'RE NOT,
AND I...

17:25.261 --> 17:27.829
REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.483
AW. I MISSED YOU, TOO.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.877
-BE QUIET.
-EXCUSE ME?

17:32.921 --> 17:34.879
NOTHING.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.580
FIRST, WE STEAM DISTILL
THE ACTUAL TOXIN

17:39.623 --> 17:42.061
INTO A SUPERSATURATED
SOLUTION.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.890
3 GRAMS PER MILLILITER
TO START.

17:45.934 --> 17:49.068
COPY THAT.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.202
GOD, IT'S SEXY WHEN
YOU GET ALL SCIENCY.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.117
NOT NOW.

17:57.598 --> 17:58.729
WHY NOT NOW?

17:58.773 --> 18:00.383
WHO CARES ABOUT
THESE PEOPLE?

18:00.427 --> 18:02.298
LET THEM TEAR
EACH OTHER TO PIECES.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.213
ALL WE NEED IS
THE FLAME.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.824
YOU'RE A NIGHTBLOOD.
WE FIX IT,

18:06.868 --> 18:08.696
WE PUT IT
IN YOUR HEAD

18:08.739 --> 18:10.915
AND SAVE HUMANITY.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.570
I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING IT,
OR I WOULDN'T BE.

18:13.614 --> 18:16.138
BECCA FRANKO DESIGNED
THE MIND DRIVES AND THE FLAME.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.880
THEY SPEAK
THE SAME LANGUAGE.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.490
WE CAN REPAIR THE CODE.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.233
DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.453
GABRIEL, YOU ENGINEERED
MEMORY DRIVES

18:26.496 --> 18:30.239
TO HOLD ENTIRE MINDS,
CONSCIOUSNESS.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.285
ON SKYRING, YOU USED
A DAMN ETCH A SKETCH

18:32.328 --> 18:35.026
TO WATCH
THE COLIN BENSON SHOW.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.941
SURELY YOU CAN RIG
SOME ELIGIUS TECH

18:36.985 --> 18:39.422
TO PULL DATA
OFF THE FLAME.

18:39.466 --> 18:42.860
YOU CAN SOLVE THE MYSTERY
OF THE STONE,

18:42.904 --> 18:46.603
START THE LAST WAR--
THE TEST, WHATEVER.

18:46.647 --> 18:49.737
NO. NO.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.783
NOT FOR CADOGAN.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.134
FOR YOU THEN.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.484
YOU'VE GOT THE BLOOD,
NOT HIM.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.964
YOU TAKE THE TEST
FOR ALL MANKIND.

19:00.008 --> 19:03.794
WE LEVEL UP
BECAUSE OF YOU.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.492
WHAT BETTER WAY TO MAKE UP
FOR ALL THE THINGS

19:05.535 --> 19:09.800
YOU DID IN THIS LAB
TO CONQUER DEATH, HMM?

19:09.844 --> 19:13.674
ALL THE BROKEN EGGS
IT TOOK TO MAKE THIS OMELET.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.896
WHAT DO YOU SAY, MY LOVE?

19:18.940 --> 19:22.944
WE CAME ACROSS THE STARS
TO SAVE THE HUMAN RACE.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.859
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.797
MAN: GET THEM OFF!

19:49.840 --> 19:51.102
JEREMIAH: IT STOPPED.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.941
THIS WAY.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.335
MURPHY: WE DON'T HAVE MUCH
TIME BEFORE THE BUGS COME BACK.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.381
BELLAMY: SCATTER THEM!

20:08.424 --> 20:09.947
LET'S GET THE DOOR OPEN.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.515
SEAL THE WINDOWS.
THE SWARM'S STILL OUTSIDE.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.648
WAIT. HOLD THE DOOR.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.218
RAVEN: CLARKE!

20:21.394 --> 20:22.743
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

20:22.786 --> 20:25.006
ANTITOXIN
FROM THE FARMHOUSE.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.442
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.227
ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US,
BUT, YES, I WAS THINKING

20:28.270 --> 20:30.185
OF MADI BEFORE YOU.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.797
ANOTHER LESSON
IN THE DESTRUCTIVENESS
OF FAMILIAL LOVE.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.551
MAN: IT DIDN'T WORK.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.597
DO YOU HAVE THE FLAME
OR NOT?

20:50.640 --> 20:52.468
IF YOU OPEN THIS DOOR,

20:52.512 --> 20:54.557
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

20:55.732 --> 20:59.258
ALL RIGHT.
DISCIPLE KELLY, THE DOOR.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.824
KELLY: YES, SIR.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.438
-OHH!
-HERE THEY COME!

21:05.481 --> 21:07.353
STAY BEHIND ME!
GO, GO!

21:07.396 --> 21:08.745
TREY: GO!

21:13.359 --> 21:17.058
WHOA, WHOA, HEY, HEY.
GOOD GUY, GOOD GUY,
GOOD GUY, REMEMBER?

21:17.101 --> 21:18.668
OHH. HEY.

21:18.712 --> 21:19.930
HEY.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.378
IT BURNS!

21:35.685 --> 21:36.947
RAVEN.

21:42.257 --> 21:46.043
DON'T WORRY.
WE HAVE ANTITOXIN
FOR EVERYONE UPSTAIRS.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.785
YOU TOOK DOWN
THE SHIELD?

21:48.829 --> 21:51.962
-YEAH. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
-NO. IT WORKED.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.877
I'LL GET THE POWER
BACK ON,

21:53.921 --> 21:56.315
HOPEFULLY WITHOUT
KILLING ANYONE THIS TIME.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.619
FOR ALL MANKIND.

22:54.285 --> 22:57.985
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.
I CAN HEAR THE BUGS.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.595
CONTROL, DISCIPLE.

23:17.961 --> 23:21.574
WOMAN: I TOLD YOU OUR ORDERS
ARE TO GUARD THE STONE
AND THE PRISONER.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.490
MAN: WE DON'T NEED
THE PRISONER.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.983
FIRST, I KILL
MY ENEMY'S ENEMY.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.076
THEN I KILL
MY ENEMY.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.176
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE GIVEN HIM THAT.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.530
WHY?

24:07.402 --> 24:09.186
I REMEMBER THINGS.

24:11.058 --> 24:13.103
YOUR SKETCHBOOK?

24:13.147 --> 24:19.240
MADI, DON'T TELL
ANYONE THAT, OK? EVER.

24:25.159 --> 24:27.640
HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE
HAVE TO STAY HERE?

24:27.683 --> 24:29.337
BELLAMY: ONCE
THE POWER'S BACK ON,

24:29.380 --> 24:31.078
THE BUGS WILL
KILL EACH OTHER,

24:31.121 --> 24:32.949
AND THE SHIELD
WILL PREVENT MORE
FROM COMING IN.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.735
UNTIL THEN, IT'S NOT
WORTH THE RISK.

24:40.435 --> 24:43.960
EMORI: HEY, FINALLY,
STRANGER.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.833
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
BELLAMY.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.185
IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU, TOO.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.927
HA! WELL, THOSE ARE
THE CLOTHES OF A MAN
WITH A STORY.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.538
YEAH, BELLAMY.
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL US A STORY?

25:04.546 --> 25:06.026
ANOTHER TIME.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.115
NOT LONG NOW,
MY SHEPHERD.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.642
COMPUTER: POWER RESTART
ALL SECTORS.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.949
AND THE CROWD GOES WILD.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.570
SERIOUSLY?

25:35.229 --> 25:37.797
COMPUTER: SECONDARY
CONTAINMENT CLEAR.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.250
UNH!

26:33.374 --> 26:35.898
HATCH USED TO SAY
RETURNING TO THE SCENE
OF A CRIME

26:35.942 --> 26:39.554
WAS LIKE A FISH THAT WAS
CAUGHT AND RELEASED

26:39.598 --> 26:42.165
BITING ON ANOTHER HOOK.

26:42.209 --> 26:46.474
"ONLY FOOLS AND FISH
DID THAT," HE'D SAY,

26:46.517 --> 26:50.609
BUT HE'S DEAD NOW
BECAUSE OF YOU,

26:50.652 --> 26:52.915
SO IT DON'T REALLY MATTER
WHAT HE'D SAY NOW, DOES IT?

26:52.959 --> 26:55.744
-NIKKI, WAIT.
-I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.790
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE TODAY

26:57.833 --> 26:59.748
IN THE SAME PLACE
THAT HE DID.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.794
THERE'S POETRY IN THAT,

27:01.837 --> 27:04.100
COMING FULL CIRCLE
AND ALL,

27:04.144 --> 27:09.105
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO HEAR
YOU SAY WHAT YOU DID.

27:11.238 --> 27:14.502
HERE IT IS. YEAH.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.374
CRY WHILE YOU
CONFESS YOUR SINS.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.725
THE GRIM REAPER
WILL WAIT.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.163
I KILLED HIM.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.864
I KNEW RADIATION
WAS LEAKING, AND...

27:28.908 --> 27:30.344
I SENT THEM IN.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.174
THEN THINGS GOT
REALLY BAD,

27:34.217 --> 27:38.178
AND I--I LOCKED
HIM IN HERE--

27:40.789 --> 27:42.312
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
HE WAS AS MUCH

27:42.356 --> 27:44.097
OF A COWARD AS I AM.

27:47.970 --> 27:51.104
HE WASN'T.
HE WAS BRAVE.

27:51.147 --> 27:54.673
I CHOSE TO LET
THEM ALL DIE...

27:56.936 --> 27:59.155
AND SAVE MYSELF
INSTEAD.

28:02.158 --> 28:05.161
IT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN ME.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.686
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.775
IF IT'LL BRING
YOU PEACE,

28:09.818 --> 28:11.385
DO IT, NIKKI.

28:20.611 --> 28:21.743
PLEASE.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.223
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

28:24.267 --> 28:27.401
YOU LIVE WITH WHAT
YOU'VE DONE.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.095
RAVEN?

29:11.619 --> 29:15.405
HEY, HEY.

29:15.449 --> 29:19.409
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

29:19.453 --> 29:20.933
YOU'RE OK.

29:53.095 --> 29:54.270
MAN: I'M GOING
AFTER THE SHEPHERD.

29:54.314 --> 29:55.794
WOMAN: YOU'LL DO
NO SUCH THING.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.360
YOU'LL FOLLOW
MY ORDERS.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.101
SHEIDHEDA: THE NATIVES
ARE GETTING RESTLESS.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.929
-YOU SHOULD HURRY.
-I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN.

30:00.973 --> 30:03.889
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
BEFORE I BLEED OUT, PLEASE.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.065
IS THERE A PROBLEM
OVER THERE?

30:06.108 --> 30:09.285
INDRA: NO.
NO PROBLEM.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.940
DISCIPLE: I AM HIS SHIELD
AND HIS SWORD.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.637
THOSE ARE MY ORDERS.

30:20.470 --> 30:23.299
SMART MOVE KILLING
THAT ONE.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.954
YOU GOT THE OTHERS
ON YOUR SIDE?

30:25.998 --> 30:27.956
NOW IF ONLY YOU COULD
GET THE ANTITOXIN

30:28.000 --> 30:31.003
FOR THE SHEPHERD,
YOU'D ALL BE HEROES.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.396
I CAN TAKE YOU TO THE LAB
WHERE--

30:33.440 --> 30:34.702
AGH! UNH!

30:39.228 --> 30:41.143
MAN: GET IN YOUR HELMET!

31:52.345 --> 31:54.608
JOSEPHINE: LOOKS LIKE
WE MISSED ALL THE FUN.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.441
INDRA?

32:27.380 --> 32:30.122
I SAVED YOUR LIFE,
INDRA.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.953
SURELY THAT IS
WORTH SOMETHING.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.693
YES, IT IS.

32:39.653 --> 32:41.350
HYAH!

32:44.832 --> 32:46.268
I DON'T NEED TO KILL YOU

32:46.312 --> 32:48.662
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ALREADY DEAD.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.933
NO ONE TREATS HIM.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.674
WASN'T PLANNING ON IT.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.328
ME NEITHER.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.524
DISCIPLE, ON COMMS:
REPORT POSITION.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.613
KELLY: ENTERING
THE GREAT HALL
WITH THE SHEPHERD.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.704
INDRA: WHERE THE HELL
IS MY DAUGHTER?

33:30.747 --> 33:33.011
CADOGAN: WHO THE HELL
IS YOUR DAUGHTER?

33:33.054 --> 33:35.187
BELLAMY: INDRA,
HOLD ON.
WE DIDN'T KNOW

33:35.230 --> 33:37.058
SHE WAS MISSING
TILL TODAY.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.060
NOBODY DID.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.758
WE'RE GONNA GET
EVERYONE BACK.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.457
PUT DOWN THE GUN.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.721
IT'S OK, INDRA.
HE'S GONNA HELP US.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.161
GABRIEL: DOES THAT MEAN
YOU HAVE THE FLAME?

33:53.205 --> 33:55.598
I DO.

33:55.642 --> 34:00.516
JOSEPHINE: NOW IS THE TIME.
TELL HIM.

34:00.560 --> 34:05.434
I BELIEVE I CAN RESTORE
THE DAMAGED CODE WITH THIS.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.702
IT'S USED TO REPAIR
MEMORY DRIVES,

34:12.746 --> 34:14.835
STITCHING TOGETHER
BROKEN STRINGS OF CODE,

34:14.878 --> 34:17.664
CODE THAT LIKE THE FLAME
ITSELF WAS CREATED BY--

34:17.707 --> 34:19.318
BECCA FRANKO.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.243
SHOW ME.

34:34.202 --> 34:37.597
JOSEPHINE: IT'S OK.
YOU CAN DO IT.

34:44.473 --> 34:48.216
IF BECCA'S MEMORIES
ARE STILL IN HERE,

34:48.260 --> 34:50.262
THIS WILL FIND THEM.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.267
NOW WE CAN START
THE LAST WAR.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.278
IT'S WORKING.

35:08.715 --> 35:11.326
JOSEPHINE: I'M SO PROUD
OF YOU, BABY.

35:11.370 --> 35:14.242
NOW VOLUNTEER.
HE NEEDS A NIGHTBLOOD.

35:17.463 --> 35:20.422
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

35:25.166 --> 35:26.776
WE ARE.

35:28.996 --> 35:30.563
I'M SORRY.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.834
HELMETS OFF
AND WEAPONS DOWN,

35:40.877 --> 35:43.358
ALL OF YOU, RIGHT NOW!

35:45.926 --> 35:48.581
ANTITOXIN.

35:48.624 --> 35:51.279
JOSEPHINE: NO, GABRIEL.
YOU NEED ME.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.804
GABRIEL, PLEASE DON'T!

35:54.848 --> 35:57.416
GABRIEL? GABRIEL,

35:57.459 --> 36:02.812
WE NEED HIM TO GET
OUR FRIENDS BACK,
YOUR FRIENDS--

36:02.856 --> 36:04.684
ECHO AND HOPE, TOO.

36:07.208 --> 36:10.080
NOW PUT DOWN THE GUN.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.691
DOUCETTE: TAKE HIM!

36:11.734 --> 36:13.171
NO!

36:16.783 --> 36:18.350
NO!

36:21.135 --> 36:22.702
DON'T LOSE FAITH.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.629
CLARKE: RAVEN, FIRE IT UP.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.718
WE NEED TO GET
TO OUR FRIENDS.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.824
WHICH PLANET?
WHERE ARE THEY?

36:59.913 --> 37:03.003
IT'S OFFLINE.

37:03.046 --> 37:05.919
ONLY I KNOW THE CODE.

37:05.962 --> 37:08.965
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.707
THERE'S ONE PLANET
WE CAN'T GET TO.

37:11.751 --> 37:15.407
ENTER THE CODE,
AND YOU GET TO LIVE.

37:30.552 --> 37:32.162
CADOGAN: THERE'S
YOUR BRIDGE. GO.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.990
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.558
NOW MOVE.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.865
YOU SHOULD HAVE
MORE FAITH, CLARKE.

37:38.908 --> 37:41.998
NOT YOU. YOU'VE
MADE YOUR CHOICE.

37:46.046 --> 37:47.743
MURPHY: I REALLY HOPE
THIS NEW THING

37:47.787 --> 37:49.702
YOU BELIEVE IN
IS WORTH IT.

37:49.745 --> 37:52.095
IT IS.

37:52.139 --> 37:54.794
COME ON. LET'S GO.

38:06.153 --> 38:08.286
INDRA, WATCH HIM.

38:13.029 --> 38:17.338
I SAID I WOULDN'T
LOSE ANYONE ELSE...

38:18.339 --> 38:22.038
BUT I HAVE--YOU.

38:22.082 --> 38:24.302
THAT DOESN'T MATTER
TO YOU, THOUGH,
DOES IT,

38:24.345 --> 38:26.478
DISCIPLE BLAKE?

38:33.180 --> 38:35.008
SO MUCH FOR TOGETHER.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.753
LET'S GO.

38:42.581 --> 38:45.410
SHEIDHEDA: I CAN HELP
YOU IF YOU HELP ME.

38:48.282 --> 38:49.979
MY THRONE.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.809
THE BOOK.

39:07.432 --> 39:08.911
CLARKE: BELLAMY...

39:25.537 --> 39:29.062
BELLAMY: CLARKE, MADI
ISN'T IN DANGER.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.020
I'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.815
I AM TRYING TO SAVE
US ALL, CLARKE.

39:42.858 --> 39:46.035
I'LL KILL CADOGAN.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

39:48.516 --> 39:49.822
HOLD, HOLD!

39:49.865 --> 39:51.867
CLARKE, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT CADOGAN.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.740
IT'S BIGGER
THAN ANY OF US.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.179
DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.879
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SHOOT ME, CLARKE.

40:03.923 --> 40:07.056
THE BRIDGE WILL CLOSE.
YOU SHOULD GO.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.407
NO WITHOUT THAT BOOK.

40:10.582 --> 40:12.714
LOOK AT YOURSELF,

40:12.758 --> 40:16.065
WHAT YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW,

40:16.109 --> 40:19.025
THE NEED TO PROTECT
SOMEONE YOU LOVE SO BADLY

40:19.068 --> 40:22.071
YOU'RE WILLING TO KILL
YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND,

40:22.115 --> 40:24.552
SOMEONE YOU TRUST
WHO'S TELLING YOU

40:24.596 --> 40:26.511
THAT THE FATE
OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE

40:26.554 --> 40:28.687
IS AT STAKE.

40:28.730 --> 40:33.213
ALL THAT SUFFERING
CAN END.

40:33.256 --> 40:34.954
MADI'S SUFFERING, TOO.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.657
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO SHARE THIS.

40:42.701 --> 40:45.399
I CAN'T LET THEM
HURTH ER.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.533
THIS IS HOW WE DO BETTER.

40:48.576 --> 40:50.926
THIS IS
THE ONLY WAY.

40:50.970 --> 40:52.537
I'M SORRY.

40:54.756 --> 40:57.106
YOU NEED TO KEEP THIS
SAFE FOR THE SHEPHERD.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.847
ME, TOO.

40:58.891 --> 41:01.328
UNH!

41:01.371 --> 41:02.982
UNH!

41:04.984 --> 41:07.813
DISCIPLE: THE BRIDGE
IS CLOSING! GET--AAH!
