WEBVTT

00:02.943 --> 00:04.842
You need to
at least consider combining

00:04.861 --> 00:06.278
some of the smaller
sanctuaries.

00:06.279 --> 00:07.378
Maybe.

00:07.380 --> 00:08.679
Maybe?

00:08.681 --> 00:10.147
Magnus, unless my
understanding

00:10.149 --> 00:11.549
of basic finance
is flawed--

00:11.551 --> 00:13.517
We appear to be
hemorrhaging money, yes.

00:13.519 --> 00:15.282
Aren't we?

00:15.284 --> 00:17.216
It depends on
your point of view.

00:18.707 --> 00:19.970
Okay, you know what,
I'm going to drop it,

00:19.972 --> 00:21.304
and then when
the repo men arrive,

00:21.306 --> 00:23.275
you can deal
with them.

00:23.277 --> 00:25.340
We're at war with insurgents
from Hollow Earth.

00:25.342 --> 00:27.042
Debt collectors
are the least of our worries.

00:27.044 --> 00:29.008
Ah, good,
you're both here.

00:29.010 --> 00:30.643
Gold star, please.

00:30.645 --> 00:33.477
I have some new info
on SCIU doings.

00:33.479 --> 00:35.713
The doings of SCIU.

00:35.715 --> 00:37.651
I thought we were locked out
of all their databases.

00:37.653 --> 00:38.622
We were.

00:38.624 --> 00:40.190
After what happened
in Buenos Aires,

00:40.192 --> 00:41.360
those guys
totally closed ranks.

00:41.362 --> 00:42.564
Couldn't make a dent.

00:42.566 --> 00:43.998
But you found a way.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.634
Those files Tesla slipped me

00:45.636 --> 00:48.003
after our little adventure
in the land of lost socks?

00:48.005 --> 00:50.038
I did a little
deep data mining,

00:50.040 --> 00:51.542
found some usernames,

00:51.544 --> 00:53.211
extrapolated
some passwords...

00:53.213 --> 00:54.747
I like where this is going.

00:54.749 --> 00:57.549
All adding up to three
upcoming SCIU research team--

00:57.551 --> 00:59.718
destinations.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.553
Baton Rouge, Bolivia,

01:01.555 --> 01:03.088
East Finchley
Station.

01:03.090 --> 01:04.221
Whoa, whoa, wait.

01:04.224 --> 01:05.456
Bolivia?

01:05.458 --> 01:07.692
Uh, yeah, a team of seven.

01:07.694 --> 01:09.126
Four ex-military,

01:09.128 --> 01:10.394
two grad students,

01:10.396 --> 01:13.663
and one anthropology prof
from U.Penn.

01:13.665 --> 01:15.665
They're headed for some badly
charted desert in the Andes.

01:15.667 --> 01:19.339
They even filed
detailed tracking info.

01:19.341 --> 01:21.375
It can't be.

01:21.377 --> 01:23.711
Why, what's there?

01:25.047 --> 01:27.316
An abnormal so elusive

01:27.318 --> 01:29.319
that even my father
gave up the search.

01:29.321 --> 01:31.422
A giant feathered serpent

01:31.424 --> 01:33.325
said to be hidden
high in the Bolivian Andes.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.294
A feathered serpent?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.664
As in Quetzalcoatl?

01:36.666 --> 01:39.400
It's believed the Aztecs
named a God after this creature.

01:39.402 --> 01:41.637
Followers of the serpent
were said to be rewarded

01:41.639 --> 01:44.073
with unusual knowledge,
strength, and health.

01:45.175 --> 01:46.477
So there were super Aztecs?

01:46.479 --> 01:49.248
But your father
never found proof.

01:49.250 --> 01:51.183
He mounted an expedition
in 1909,

01:51.185 --> 01:52.719
but he came back empty-handed,

01:52.721 --> 01:54.087
the only survivor.

01:54.089 --> 01:56.490
After that,
he left very strict instructions

01:56.492 --> 01:58.626
that the serpent be left
entirely alone.

01:58.628 --> 02:00.494
So how the hell
did SCIU find it?

02:00.496 --> 02:01.696
Well, that's
the worrying part.

02:01.698 --> 02:03.131
Well, they're
upping their game.

02:03.133 --> 02:06.668
Which makes our job
decidedly more difficult.

02:06.670 --> 02:09.840
Henry, have Declan look into
the other two operations.

02:09.842 --> 02:11.642
You and I
are going to Bolivia.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.128 --> 02:32.129
Remember the part about
us getting here first?

02:34.232 --> 02:36.166
They're in
way over their heads.

02:39.605 --> 02:40.538
Well, your father
was right.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.240
It's definitely real.

02:42.242 --> 02:43.842
And it needs
to be left in peace.

02:45.144 --> 02:46.612
If SCIU gets it
back to their labs...

02:46.614 --> 02:48.548
Absolutely.

02:50.151 --> 02:53.520
It's not exactly
seal team six in there.

02:53.522 --> 02:54.855
You want, uh,

02:54.857 --> 02:57.358
Mr. Mall Cop
on the rock there?

02:57.360 --> 03:00.194
How about
the skinny guy?

03:08.170 --> 03:09.402
Hold it!

03:09.404 --> 03:11.538
Everyone, stay put
and you won't get hurt!

yeah, um...

03:41.246 --> 03:43.680
So it's me, your dad,

03:43.682 --> 03:46.016
Henry Foss, hello.

03:46.018 --> 03:49.019
Wow, so who knows what
the world's going to be like

03:49.021 --> 03:50.688
when you're all grown up, huh?

03:50.690 --> 03:52.957
Hopefully things
will be different for our kind,

03:52.959 --> 03:54.692
for abnormals.

03:54.694 --> 03:57.595
Maybe we won't have to live
in secret anymore.

03:57.597 --> 03:59.464
You'll probably have jet-packs,

03:59.466 --> 04:02.366
and it's about time, am I right?

04:02.368 --> 04:03.634
Up high. Boom.

04:03.636 --> 04:04.502
Yeah.

04:06.405 --> 04:08.506
I'm going to be lucky
if they even have machines

04:08.508 --> 04:10.675
that play digital video.

04:10.677 --> 04:12.209
Wow.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.577
Yeah, the boss,

04:13.579 --> 04:16.346
she still insists on
everything being analog records.

04:16.349 --> 04:18.516
You know, vinyl music
and paper ledgers

04:18.517 --> 04:20.051
may be heavy as hell,

04:20.053 --> 04:22.988
but you can still read 'em
after the zombie apocalypse.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.023
Oh, wow.

04:25.025 --> 04:28.260
I hope you're not watching this
after the zombie apocalypse.

04:28.262 --> 04:30.462
But if you are, you remember,

04:30.464 --> 04:33.733
they are very slow,
and they can't climb trees.

04:33.735 --> 04:37.370
Also, a good cricket bat
to the head works wonders, so...

04:37.372 --> 04:39.739
Oh, man, you're going to
grow up in England!

04:39.741 --> 04:42.408
You're going to actually <i> have</i>
<i>a cricket bat,</i>

04:42.410 --> 04:44.710
and an accent.

04:44.712 --> 04:48.747
My kid is gonna have an accent.
That is awesome!

04:48.749 --> 04:50.716
This is going really well.

04:57.690 --> 05:00.493
What the hell
did they hit us with?

05:00.495 --> 05:03.363
Some sort of sonic
energy weapon.

05:03.365 --> 05:04.731
Probably
the same thing they used

05:04.733 --> 05:06.132
to bring down the serpent.

05:07.468 --> 05:09.303
Well, that explains
the ringing in my ears.

05:09.305 --> 05:10.170
Doc!

05:10.172 --> 05:11.438
They're awake.

05:17.479 --> 05:19.546
Dr. Magnus.
Dr. Zimmerman.

05:19.548 --> 05:21.249
They briefed us about you.

05:21.251 --> 05:22.750
I wish I could
say the same.

05:22.752 --> 05:23.651
Michelle Moran.

05:23.653 --> 05:24.618
You may have seen my papers

05:24.620 --> 05:25.586
on the search for
Grendel's children

05:25.588 --> 05:26.620
in Northern Ireland--

05:26.622 --> 05:28.188
Grendel's a myth.

05:28.190 --> 05:29.623
They said you'd say that.

05:29.625 --> 05:32.726
Release us immediately,
and your prisoner.

05:32.728 --> 05:34.428
The dragon?

05:34.430 --> 05:36.630
Nah, sorry,
too big a prize.

05:36.632 --> 05:38.165
No offense to you two.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.800
Look, I'm
going to give you

05:39.802 --> 05:41.135
a chance to fix this

05:41.137 --> 05:42.103
before anyone
gets hurt.

05:42.105 --> 05:43.504
Really, Dr. Magnus,

05:43.506 --> 05:45.806
you're hardly in charge here.

05:45.808 --> 05:47.875
You are dealing
with a creature

05:47.877 --> 05:49.843
that you barely understand.

05:49.845 --> 05:51.445
You're so out of your depth.

05:51.447 --> 05:53.214
I've made a lifetime study
of cryptozoology

05:53.216 --> 05:55.449
and comparative
mythology.

05:55.451 --> 05:57.151
This is an amazing opportunity.

05:57.153 --> 05:59.520
A glimpse into a larger world,

05:59.522 --> 06:01.722
something that
most people don't see.

06:01.724 --> 06:04.490
You genuinely have no idea
what you're dealing with.

06:04.492 --> 06:06.793
These are creatures
that can move mountains,

06:06.795 --> 06:08.594
redirect tidal waves.

06:08.596 --> 06:09.962
We have secure
containment.

06:09.964 --> 06:11.096
What about transport?

06:11.098 --> 06:12.297
'Cause that's
going to be a party.

06:12.299 --> 06:13.432
It's taken care of.

06:13.434 --> 06:15.501
Listen to me.

06:15.503 --> 06:16.802
If you try to move it,

06:16.804 --> 06:19.205
either it will end up dead,
or you will.

06:21.241 --> 06:23.276
Guess which is
the greater tragedy.

06:24.478 --> 06:25.845
Introductions are over.

06:25.847 --> 06:28.214
Open up the drop zone
and radio for the chopper.

06:28.216 --> 06:29.916
Wait, drop zone?

06:29.918 --> 06:30.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

06:32.353 --> 06:33.887
No, don't!

06:35.857 --> 06:38.291
The roofs
of these caverns

06:38.293 --> 06:39.759
are striated at
their weakest points

06:39.761 --> 06:41.227
with a glassine crystal.

06:41.229 --> 06:42.662
"X" marks the spot.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.167
Stop!

06:48.169 --> 06:49.868
Everyone out!

06:57.644 --> 06:59.445
Get out!

06:59.447 --> 07:00.613
Will!

07:00.615 --> 07:02.615
- Leave him!
- No!

07:37.400 --> 07:38.800
Magnus?

07:40.616 --> 07:42.517
Magnus!

07:46.455 --> 07:48.756
Will?

07:54.462 --> 07:55.761
Can you move?

07:55.763 --> 07:57.163
I don't think
anything's broken.

07:59.434 --> 08:01.067
Maybe a couple of ribs.

08:02.403 --> 08:03.569
The others?

08:06.607 --> 08:08.407
Dear God.

08:08.409 --> 08:10.142
You're injured.

08:12.012 --> 08:13.646
Let me see.

08:13.648 --> 08:14.813
Okay, okay...

08:23.089 --> 08:24.189
The bullet's still in there.

08:25.958 --> 08:27.025
That's wonderful news.

08:29.028 --> 08:31.629
Got to get it out.

08:40.106 --> 08:42.573
The supplies are in bad shape.

08:42.576 --> 08:45.644
There's a med kit.

08:49.517 --> 08:52.453
What's left of it.

09:00.963 --> 09:02.697
Okay... okay...

09:04.767 --> 09:06.701
Will, Will,
stay with me.

09:14.110 --> 09:16.645
Steady, Will.

09:20.118 --> 09:22.152
All right, all right...

09:22.154 --> 09:23.220
The worst of it's over.

09:23.222 --> 09:24.688
Magnus, I doubt that.

09:24.690 --> 09:28.693
I need you to hold
this flashlight.

09:28.695 --> 09:29.794
Come on, right there.

09:29.796 --> 09:32.797
Yeah.

09:36.670 --> 09:39.070
I got it, I got it...

09:42.008 --> 09:44.509
Come on!
Come on!

09:44.511 --> 09:46.945
Good, good, good!
Almost done...

09:46.947 --> 09:49.080
Good job, William.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.151
Okay, good.

09:54.153 --> 09:56.120
No damage
to the internal organs.

09:56.122 --> 09:58.856
You've lost a lot of blood.

09:58.858 --> 09:59.857
You need to be hydrated.

09:59.859 --> 10:00.858
Will, do you hear me?
Will!

10:01.694 --> 10:03.961
Will, stay with me.

10:03.963 --> 10:06.097
Uh, w-water.

10:06.099 --> 10:08.933
Water, good.

10:12.272 --> 10:13.538
Bloody hell.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.282
All right...

10:48.840 --> 10:52.142
Ah, yes. Okay.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.318
Found an underground spring.

11:06.927 --> 11:10.028
At least we'll have
fresh water.

11:10.030 --> 11:13.165
Will...

11:13.167 --> 11:14.333
Will!

11:14.335 --> 11:17.836
Will, come on,
come on...

11:25.110 --> 11:27.611
You're going to love this.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.915
"Full outer shell
safety shield system."

11:31.917 --> 11:33.917
The F.O.S.S.S.S.!

11:33.919 --> 11:35.252
We'll name it later.

11:35.254 --> 11:37.722
So, this is
a personal energy shield

11:37.724 --> 11:40.057
that acts like body armor
against pulse weapons.

11:40.059 --> 11:43.227
So, uh, sonic, E.M.,
full spectrum.

11:43.229 --> 11:45.230
Now, it's still
a work in progress,

11:45.232 --> 11:47.132
but once I iron out
the last few kinks,

11:47.134 --> 11:49.969
this baby is gonna
change the world.

12:08.420 --> 12:12.356
Ha!
That's what I'm talking about.

12:22.668 --> 12:23.702
You want some help?

12:24.704 --> 12:26.171
You should rest.

12:26.173 --> 12:27.239
I'm fine.

12:27.241 --> 12:28.707
Besides, we've got
to get out of here.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.145
Feel my pulse.
Slow and steady.

12:34.348 --> 12:35.248
Half Irish.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.851
Your color's much better.

12:39.386 --> 12:41.454
How are you?
The broken ribs?

12:42.890 --> 12:44.391
A false alarm.

12:44.393 --> 12:46.792
Just had the wind
knocked out of me.

12:48.062 --> 12:50.295
When Moran
fails to check in,

12:50.297 --> 12:52.263
they'll send an
extraction team after her.

12:52.265 --> 12:54.932
I'd say we have 48 hours
to be clear of the area,

12:54.934 --> 12:58.366
or we'll wind up
answering for this.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.908
There's a shelf over there.

13:13.082 --> 13:15.316
It's a seam.

13:15.318 --> 13:17.052
It could lead to another tunnel.

13:21.424 --> 13:22.757
You all right?

13:24.461 --> 13:27.495
Just a little claustrophobic.

13:27.497 --> 13:30.332
We just need to get
through this section.

13:30.334 --> 13:31.967
It'll be over soon.

13:31.969 --> 13:33.101
No, no, Magnus,
Magnus, this is crazy.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.870
We should go back.

13:34.872 --> 13:36.839
To what,
the serpent's lair?

13:36.841 --> 13:38.741
How does that
make any sense?

13:38.743 --> 13:40.143
We have no idea

13:40.145 --> 13:42.078
if this crawl space
will lead us to the surface.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.112
We could be led
into a dead end,

13:43.114 --> 13:44.146
or get trapped, or something.

13:44.148 --> 13:45.782
What we do know
for certain is

13:45.784 --> 13:47.283
there's no way out
where we came from.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.118
We have to keep moving forward.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.955
Fine, so it's standard
operating procedure,

13:51.957 --> 13:53.790
Helen Magnus style,
I guess!

13:53.792 --> 13:56.126
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

13:56.128 --> 13:57.861
You know...

13:57.863 --> 14:00.931
"Once more into the breach,
for England,"

14:00.933 --> 14:02.198
et cetera, et cetera.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.333
No matter how stupid
dangerous it is!

14:03.335 --> 14:05.335
I'm saying this is not
the first time

14:05.337 --> 14:06.870
I've been stuck
in a bad place with you.

14:06.872 --> 14:08.538
I understand
how being in a tight space

14:08.540 --> 14:10.473
can stress anyone out.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.108
You don't have to be
claustrophobic

14:12.110 --> 14:17.079
to know that we are under
tons of rock with no map.

14:17.081 --> 14:18.948
We just have to keep moving.

14:20.218 --> 14:21.918
No, no, no, no, Magnus,
I've got to go back!

14:21.920 --> 14:22.819
Will! No!

14:22.821 --> 14:23.954
Magnus! I need air!

14:23.956 --> 14:24.955
Then keep moving!

14:24.957 --> 14:25.956
No! I'm sick of being

14:25.958 --> 14:27.258
the expendable human
on the ticket!

14:27.260 --> 14:28.225
I'm going back!

14:28.227 --> 14:29.427
Really?

14:29.429 --> 14:31.196
Wow.

14:31.198 --> 14:33.432
I thought you were
tougher than that.

14:33.434 --> 14:35.167
We are moving forward.

14:35.169 --> 14:37.036
Fine! Dammit!

14:46.845 --> 14:48.512
Oh God...

15:04.562 --> 15:06.529
You're welcome.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.865
For what?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.433
Talking to me like I'm a child?

15:12.904 --> 15:16.307
Anger is a great motivator.

15:16.309 --> 15:20.845
Overcomes fear every time.

15:20.847 --> 15:22.280
That's your M.O., isn't it?

15:22.282 --> 15:24.582
Achieve the result
by any means necessary.

15:26.986 --> 15:29.121
You need to rest,

15:29.123 --> 15:30.289
and I recommend silence.

15:33.126 --> 15:35.161
How you feeling?

15:35.163 --> 15:36.295
Any nausea?

15:36.297 --> 15:37.363
Shortness of breath?

15:37.365 --> 15:39.432
Oh, yeah, plenty of both.

15:39.434 --> 15:42.468
Classic signs of hypoxia,

15:42.470 --> 15:44.502
as is the short temper.

15:45.539 --> 15:46.571
It felt real.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.340
I need to monitor
your heart rate.

15:52.043 --> 15:54.445
Your system's
slowing way down.

15:54.447 --> 15:57.315
At the very least
I need to stabilize that wound.

16:00.186 --> 16:02.087
Magnus...

16:02.089 --> 16:04.123
Bloody hell.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.992
There's a heart rate monitor
but no adrenaline.

16:06.994 --> 16:08.461
This is useless!

16:08.463 --> 16:09.428
Magnus...

16:17.237 --> 16:18.571
Dear God, Will.

16:18.573 --> 16:19.672
What's in that water?

16:32.347 --> 16:33.914
Your heart rate's improved.

16:33.916 --> 16:36.450
It's quite steady, actually.

16:36.452 --> 16:38.386
It's just itching
or something,

16:38.388 --> 16:40.355
like the muscles
are healing.

16:40.357 --> 16:41.422
I mean, at this rate,

16:41.424 --> 16:42.256
I'll be able to
pick the scab

16:42.258 --> 16:43.925
in the morning.

16:43.927 --> 16:48.162
Look, I know it seems
quite incredible,

16:48.164 --> 16:50.430
but I still don't trust it.

16:50.432 --> 16:54.402
I mean, this wound
was more than severe.

16:54.404 --> 16:58.106
What seems like fast healing
may only be superficial.

16:58.108 --> 17:00.141
Well, I feel
a thousand times better.

17:00.143 --> 17:01.442
I mean, this water must possess
a naturally occurring

17:01.444 --> 17:04.345
adenosine inhibitor
or something.

17:04.347 --> 17:05.946
I beg your pardon?

17:07.518 --> 17:08.951
Where the hell
did that come from?

17:08.953 --> 17:10.352
Not to, uh,

17:10.354 --> 17:12.354
insult your knowledge
of medicine, Will, but--

17:12.356 --> 17:14.222
No, I mean,
first year pre-med?

17:14.223 --> 17:15.323
I haven't thought about
that stuff in years.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.992
But...

17:17.994 --> 17:19.461
I remember everything.

17:19.463 --> 17:21.229
It's like I have
the damn textbook

17:21.231 --> 17:23.598
right in front of me.

17:23.599 --> 17:24.532
Will...

17:27.169 --> 17:28.569
that serpent...

17:28.571 --> 17:30.705
is said to give its followers
wisdom and strength.

17:32.108 --> 17:33.709
But what if
it's not the creature at all?

17:35.545 --> 17:39.214
It was the water
it was guarding.

17:41.652 --> 17:43.519
Increased
oxygen intake,

17:43.521 --> 17:45.187
improved focus
and memory,

17:45.189 --> 17:46.388
rapid healing,

17:46.390 --> 17:48.056
they'd all seem like
God-given powers

17:48.058 --> 17:49.625
to primitive cultures.

17:49.627 --> 17:52.295
SCIU was after
the wrong thing all along.

17:52.297 --> 17:54.464
As was my father.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.233
He would have loved this.

17:57.235 --> 18:00.236
As miraculous
as the water's effects are,

18:00.238 --> 18:03.172
they are only short-term.

18:03.174 --> 18:05.475
That first dose I gave you
didn't last very long.

18:05.477 --> 18:07.977
Yeah, and it
left me exhausted.

18:07.979 --> 18:10.480
And somewhat bitter.

18:10.482 --> 18:12.282
What about you?

18:12.284 --> 18:13.750
You drank the stuff
the same time I did.

18:15.486 --> 18:18.021
I suppose my unique physiology

18:18.023 --> 18:20.157
could have made me
immune to its effects.

18:20.159 --> 18:21.692
Your bruised ribs?

18:21.694 --> 18:22.693
The "false alarm"?

18:22.695 --> 18:26.163
That's more like
accelerated healing,

18:26.165 --> 18:28.765
or like a blast of dopamine
that covers the pain.

18:30.502 --> 18:32.035
Yeah, it's possible.

18:32.037 --> 18:33.671
No, it's a fact.

18:33.673 --> 18:36.040
Your weird blood chemistry
may slow down the timing,

18:36.042 --> 18:37.775
but if you got the high,

18:37.777 --> 18:38.709
the low is coming,

18:38.711 --> 18:39.777
just like me.

18:42.381 --> 18:44.316
Let's keep moving.

18:47.588 --> 18:49.121
Nice, right?

18:49.123 --> 18:51.524
Lightweight sensor net,
completely wearable.

18:51.526 --> 18:52.625
Three pounds total.

18:52.627 --> 18:54.360
Less than Kevlar.

18:54.362 --> 18:55.895
See, folks around here,

18:55.897 --> 18:58.630
they get in dangerous situations
on an almost weekly basis, so...

18:58.632 --> 19:02.301
If I can get this thing working,
maybe I can save someone's life,

19:02.303 --> 19:04.670
maybe even mine.

19:04.672 --> 19:08.307
Just one small issue.

19:08.309 --> 19:10.610
Still working
on lightweight power.

19:10.612 --> 19:11.744
It's totally portable.

19:11.746 --> 19:13.646
There's just
some balance issues.

19:13.648 --> 19:16.082
We can work on that later.

19:16.084 --> 19:17.283
Ready?

19:23.059 --> 19:25.226
We'll work on
the power surge issues now.

19:26.629 --> 19:28.330
Listen, Magnus,
about before...

19:28.332 --> 19:30.832
You mean when you accused me

19:30.834 --> 19:34.435
of recklessly
endangering your life?

19:34.437 --> 19:36.103
Uh, yeah.

19:36.105 --> 19:38.639
I guess that was
kind of childish.

19:38.641 --> 19:42.176
Let's just
call it withdrawal.

19:42.178 --> 19:45.546
Anger, accusations,

19:45.548 --> 19:47.648
they're all just
chemical misfires.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.516
Sure, blame the water.

19:49.518 --> 19:51.852
Do you really think
I risk your life cavalierly?

19:53.855 --> 19:55.322
I think you're so jaded

19:55.324 --> 19:57.158
that you need the risk of death
to hold your attention.

19:59.529 --> 20:01.229
Or worse,

20:01.231 --> 20:03.231
you don't think death
will ever catch you.

20:06.836 --> 20:10.539
Thank you
for your honesty.

20:10.541 --> 20:12.407
Even this.

20:12.409 --> 20:14.810
We only ever talk
when it suits you,

20:14.812 --> 20:16.411
on your terms,

20:16.413 --> 20:18.413
and I better get on board
or get out of the way.

20:18.415 --> 20:19.781
Look, I already apologized

20:19.783 --> 20:21.349
for the way I handled
saving Abby.

20:21.351 --> 20:22.850
Trust me, it won't
happen again.

20:22.852 --> 20:24.284
I have no doubt
about that.

20:24.286 --> 20:26.220
We need to
stop talking. Now.

20:26.222 --> 20:27.387
This is war for you.

20:27.389 --> 20:30.490
Living under
combat conditions.

20:30.492 --> 20:33.727
Imagine doing it
for five lifetimes!

20:33.729 --> 20:35.329
Imagine having one lifetime

20:35.331 --> 20:37.431
to do everything
that matters to you.

20:37.433 --> 20:40.300
Magnus,

20:40.302 --> 20:41.869
you could give a hundred years
to the Sanctuary

20:41.871 --> 20:43.404
and still have
hundreds more to go.

20:43.406 --> 20:45.840
I only get one set of days.

20:47.143 --> 20:48.376
I think you need
to appreciate

20:48.378 --> 20:49.311
what it means

20:49.313 --> 20:51.613
if I give them all to you.

20:57.753 --> 21:01.155
I think about it every day.

21:15.637 --> 21:17.638
We must be close
to the surface.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.708
It looks to be about
a hundred feet up.

21:20.710 --> 21:23.277
That's a 10-storey
building.

21:23.279 --> 21:25.613
Straight up,
no footholds.

21:25.615 --> 21:27.515
There's no way
we're climbing out.

21:27.517 --> 21:28.515
Well, not here, no,

21:28.517 --> 21:29.917
not without equipment,

21:29.919 --> 21:32.419
but at least
we're getting closer.

21:32.421 --> 21:33.587
Yeah.

21:36.358 --> 21:38.259
Will!

21:41.764 --> 21:43.598
Just a sec...

21:43.600 --> 21:45.700
Just wait a second, okay?

21:45.702 --> 21:47.502
Okay...

21:49.939 --> 21:52.607
When did this start?

21:52.609 --> 21:55.509
Just right now.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.448
Oh...

22:04.286 --> 22:05.485
Your pulse is thready,

22:05.487 --> 22:06.653
getting weaker.

22:06.655 --> 22:09.289
This is not good.

22:09.291 --> 22:12.426
I'm definitely crashing here.

22:13.462 --> 22:14.728
This last dose

22:14.730 --> 22:16.230
lasted half as long
as the one before.

22:16.232 --> 22:17.565
I drank twice as much.

22:17.567 --> 22:18.733
It should have lasted longer.

22:18.735 --> 22:20.401
Maybe this is how it works.

22:20.403 --> 22:22.604
The bigger the high,
the faster the crash.

22:22.606 --> 22:24.440
Reminds me of college.

22:25.843 --> 22:26.742
It hurts again, doesn't it?

22:26.744 --> 22:29.379
No, just leave it alone.

22:29.381 --> 22:30.847
Whatever's
in this water

22:30.849 --> 22:31.949
is creating a cycle

22:31.951 --> 22:33.883
whereby it wears off

22:33.885 --> 22:35.485
more and more quickly
each time,

22:35.487 --> 22:37.020
leaving you in worse shape
than when you started.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.923
You'll need an elevated dose
just to stay functional.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.559
No, I'm done with
the liquid psychosis.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.527
You're not going to make it
out of here without this--

22:44.529 --> 22:45.995
Magnus, just let me be!

22:45.997 --> 22:47.764
You can't trust your judgment--

22:47.766 --> 22:48.865
Oh, and I can trust yours?

22:48.867 --> 22:49.699
Yes.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.433
Magnus, no!

22:56.473 --> 22:58.006
Will, I--

23:00.743 --> 23:01.977
Thanks.

23:13.288 --> 23:14.555
Now that
your head is clear,

23:14.557 --> 23:16.557
you know that I did
the right thing.

23:16.559 --> 23:17.925
You're feeling stronger,

23:17.927 --> 23:19.760
your wound
is healing again.

23:19.762 --> 23:21.528
Never felt better.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.531
Stop walking away
from me, please.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.467
I need to rest.

23:26.469 --> 23:28.769
We have to keep moving.

23:30.406 --> 23:33.074
Okay, fine,
you did the right thing.

23:33.076 --> 23:34.443
I still get
to hate you for it.

23:36.846 --> 23:39.782
Go ahead.

23:39.784 --> 23:41.817
I always do what others can't.

23:41.819 --> 23:43.586
That's my job.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.055
If I had listened to you,

23:45.057 --> 23:47.624
Abby would be dead right now,

23:47.626 --> 23:48.658
you'd be bleeding out

23:48.660 --> 23:50.427
in the corner
of this cave system.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.862
Life is not a bloody
popularity contest!

23:55.432 --> 23:56.665
I could have
let her die,

23:56.667 --> 24:00.335
I could have consoled you
at her funeral,

24:00.337 --> 24:03.405
or I could save her,

24:03.407 --> 24:07.441
even though it meant
risking our friendship,

24:07.443 --> 24:09.677
and I did know that much, Will.

24:09.679 --> 24:12.980
Either way,
the show must go on.

24:12.982 --> 24:14.883
You can't get close to anybody,

24:14.885 --> 24:16.551
because you're just
going to lose them, right?

24:19.355 --> 24:21.056
Would you blame me
if that were true?

24:22.860 --> 24:24.794
Magnus, what good
is your lifetime

24:24.796 --> 24:27.765
if you don't allow yourself
to connect with anyone?

24:29.901 --> 24:31.402
You surround yourself
with people

24:31.404 --> 24:32.737
who would do
anything for you,

24:32.739 --> 24:34.038
and then you turn
your back on them

24:34.040 --> 24:35.807
when they don't
live up to your standards.

24:35.809 --> 24:36.808
That's ridiculous--

24:36.810 --> 24:37.809
John Druitt.

24:37.811 --> 24:39.878
You can't even begin
to judge that--

24:39.880 --> 24:41.447
Griffin, Watson,

24:41.449 --> 24:43.082
and now me.

24:43.084 --> 24:45.984
Are we all just
expendable in your mind?

24:45.986 --> 24:48.554
Is that how you cope?

24:50.023 --> 24:51.490
Ashley?

24:54.961 --> 24:57.063
You bastard.

25:27.890 --> 25:29.257
Magnus, come on!

26:34.959 --> 26:36.393
Here, it's time for you
to drink the magic stuff.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.361
Come on, come on,
don't fight me.

26:49.805 --> 26:52.106
Magnus...

26:56.110 --> 26:59.379
A curtain of light.

26:59.381 --> 27:01.982
The serpent
won't cross through it.

27:01.984 --> 27:04.751
The first time was
when that SCIU idiot

27:04.753 --> 27:07.387
let the direct sunlight
into its lair.

27:07.389 --> 27:11.023
The striated crystals must
filter out the UV rays.

27:11.025 --> 27:14.794
And that's why it lives
down in these caves.

27:14.796 --> 27:17.429
Its skin burns in full sun.

27:20.934 --> 27:23.869
Okay...

27:23.871 --> 27:27.506
F.O.S.S.S.S., full outer shell
safety shield system prototype

27:27.508 --> 27:30.108
high-density power test,
version one.

27:30.110 --> 27:32.110
Here we go.

27:44.257 --> 27:45.925
Back to square one.

27:47.261 --> 27:49.296
How's that water supply?

27:49.298 --> 27:51.098
Not drinkable.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.801
Too much copper
content in these walls.

27:53.803 --> 27:55.870
No, I mean the good stuff.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.241
There's about
five doses left.

28:05.281 --> 28:06.515
We need to get
to that tunnel

28:06.517 --> 28:08.083
on the other side.

28:08.085 --> 28:09.252
Which means we have to
get that damn serpent

28:09.254 --> 28:11.521
off our backs.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.523
Not a chance.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.193
You know, we are
always going with

28:16.195 --> 28:17.962
your crazy schemes.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.096
For once, why don't you try
returning the favor?

28:19.098 --> 28:21.365
For once!

28:21.367 --> 28:23.268
You're on the downward side
of a dose.

28:23.270 --> 28:25.571
Okay, okay,
here we go.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.139
Helen Magnus knows best.

28:27.141 --> 28:29.141
Will, please.

28:29.143 --> 28:34.481
Before we say
anything else we might regret...

28:34.483 --> 28:37.083
If you're feeling
angry, paranoid,

28:37.085 --> 28:39.152
have a sip of this,

28:39.154 --> 28:41.921
and then we can work out
a plan together.

28:41.923 --> 28:44.589
All right?

28:44.591 --> 28:47.292
Don't mind if I do.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.529
Will, no!

28:51.531 --> 28:52.830
Will! Will!

28:56.468 --> 28:57.968
Do you realize
what you've done?

28:57.970 --> 29:01.105
That will kill you!

29:10.351 --> 29:11.183
Oh, Magnus...

29:13.152 --> 29:15.521
If you could see
what I see...

29:15.523 --> 29:16.856
What do you see?

29:37.041 --> 29:39.176
That's what I'm talking about.

29:40.578 --> 29:43.547
Yeah. Until nightfall.

29:44.983 --> 29:46.184
No.

29:46.186 --> 29:47.585
We're not going
to be here by then.

29:47.587 --> 29:49.587
Look...

29:51.223 --> 29:53.525
See?

29:53.527 --> 29:55.560
There's an opening at
the end of the pool.

29:55.562 --> 29:56.962
There's a current
in here.

29:56.964 --> 29:57.930
It's coming
from the outside.

29:57.932 --> 29:59.998
When we find
the ingress,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.235
we're home free.

30:03.237 --> 30:05.203
Very elegant,

30:05.205 --> 30:07.138
but, Will,

30:07.140 --> 30:10.341
when this wears off...

30:10.343 --> 30:13.644
My body's going to
shut down completely.

30:19.366 --> 30:21.033
This is madness, will.

30:21.035 --> 30:24.704
Yes, you may have found us
a pathway out of here,

30:24.706 --> 30:26.772
but when that
withdrawal hits--

30:26.774 --> 30:28.707
It'll be epic.

30:28.709 --> 30:30.642
It will kill you,
and soon.

30:32.445 --> 30:34.613
Which is why you have
to keep me moving,

30:34.615 --> 30:36.047
no matter what
you have to do

30:36.049 --> 30:37.415
or say to me.

30:37.417 --> 30:39.451
Said one junkie
to the other.

30:39.453 --> 30:41.953
The last time I crashed,

30:41.955 --> 30:45.590
I didn't even care
about getting out.

30:45.592 --> 30:48.460
Don't let that
happen again.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.500
This thing is dead-ending.

30:55.502 --> 30:59.505
I need more power
in less space.

30:59.507 --> 31:02.507
I kind of wanted this
to go differently.

31:02.509 --> 31:04.944
A big triumph, huge success...

31:04.946 --> 31:08.615
I wanted you to see
the Foss mojo working.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.551
See, the thing is, I, uh,

31:11.553 --> 31:13.954
I don't really remember
anything about my parents.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.423
I don't even know
what happened to them.

31:16.425 --> 31:18.459
The world can be
a pretty dangerous place

31:18.461 --> 31:19.760
for folks like us.

31:19.762 --> 31:20.795
I thought it was
getting better,

31:20.797 --> 31:26.934
but, uh, now, not so much.

31:26.936 --> 31:30.537
So I just, I wanted you to know,

31:30.539 --> 31:33.874
you know, if something
did happen to me,

31:33.876 --> 31:38.045
and I wasn't able
to take care of you...

31:38.047 --> 31:39.913
I just didn't want you
to go through life

31:39.915 --> 31:44.652
wondering
what kind of guy I was.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.161
The deeper you get,

31:52.163 --> 31:54.263
the stronger the current,

31:54.265 --> 31:55.797
and it's way deeper
than you can swim, Will,

31:55.799 --> 31:56.798
and I couldn't find
another way--

31:56.800 --> 31:59.468
give me five minutes.

31:59.470 --> 32:01.170
Sorry.
That's not a good idea--

32:01.172 --> 32:02.804
Five minutes.

32:02.806 --> 32:03.839
Stop wasting my time!

32:03.841 --> 32:06.174
Get up there.

32:06.176 --> 32:08.809
You need
to keep moving.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.014
Why me?

32:14.016 --> 32:17.719
Of all the cops,
profilers,

32:17.721 --> 32:21.090
cryptozoologists
in the world,

32:21.092 --> 32:22.759
you chose me.

32:22.761 --> 32:23.926
The eight-year-old kid

32:23.928 --> 32:26.129
whose mother was killed
in a monster attack.

32:26.131 --> 32:27.497
That is not
a coincidence.

32:27.499 --> 32:28.664
Magnus...

32:28.666 --> 32:30.667
Come on,
keep moving.

32:34.873 --> 32:36.640
My Harvard scholarship...

32:36.642 --> 32:40.177
That was your money,
wasn't it?

32:40.179 --> 32:41.278
All this time

32:41.280 --> 32:42.746
I thought I was making
my own decisions,

32:42.748 --> 32:46.784
but I was already
on your damn payroll.

32:50.121 --> 32:51.121
Yes.

32:51.123 --> 32:55.025
Yes, I paid for your education,

32:55.027 --> 32:56.727
because I thought
you'd more than earned it,

32:56.729 --> 32:59.630
but I'd never force you
to do anything.

33:02.868 --> 33:05.669
If you had said no
to joining the Sanctuary,

33:05.671 --> 33:06.871
we wouldn't be here today.

33:09.875 --> 33:11.108
Believe me, Will,

33:11.110 --> 33:14.946
if I could control life
like a bloody chess game,

33:14.948 --> 33:18.216
a lot of things would have
turned out very differently.

33:18.218 --> 33:20.318
Yeah.

33:20.320 --> 33:24.589
Well, I guess we'll never
know the truth, will we?

33:24.591 --> 33:25.757
Dead end.

33:31.332 --> 33:32.565
Will...

34:05.268 --> 34:06.802
Will!

34:06.804 --> 34:08.003
There's an opening!

34:10.072 --> 34:12.873
There's a way out.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.609
We can chimney out of here!

34:14.610 --> 34:17.378
It's only
about 40 feet.

34:21.784 --> 34:22.617
No...

34:22.619 --> 34:24.752
Oh, no.

34:24.754 --> 34:26.821
No, no,
there's no way.

34:28.123 --> 34:32.193
Here, that's not you talking.

34:32.195 --> 34:36.764
The Will Zimmerman I know
wants to be with Abby,

34:36.766 --> 34:38.199
and have everything
he ever wanted

34:38.201 --> 34:40.101
to prove me wrong
about living a balanced life.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.404
Come on, get up.

34:42.406 --> 34:43.339
Leave me here.

34:43.341 --> 34:45.408
Leave me.

34:45.409 --> 34:46.943
You can do this!

34:46.945 --> 34:48.411
No. Magnus...

34:48.413 --> 34:49.346
You go.

34:51.949 --> 34:54.951
That's not an option.
Come on.

34:55.853 --> 34:58.120
No.
No, no, no...

35:04.360 --> 35:08.896
I'm going back
for more water.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.732
I'm going to need this.

35:11.734 --> 35:13.133
It'll give me an idea

35:13.135 --> 35:14.935
of how much longer
I can keep going.

35:14.937 --> 35:16.704
You're not going to make it.

35:16.706 --> 35:17.705
See?

35:17.707 --> 35:20.074
Now you're just trying
to piss me off.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.444
Magnus...

35:23.446 --> 35:27.683
I don't...

35:27.685 --> 35:29.451
I don't regret--

35:29.453 --> 35:31.220
I don't regret...

35:31.222 --> 35:33.389
Regret anything.

35:33.391 --> 35:34.690
But please,

35:34.692 --> 35:37.159
please don't
do this.

35:37.161 --> 35:40.995
'Cause if you do, we're both
gonna die down here.

36:04.487 --> 36:06.021
I'll be back soon.

36:10.827 --> 36:12.328
Please...

36:13.830 --> 36:15.364
Magnus?

37:04.908 --> 37:07.176
Magnus...

37:40.211 --> 37:42.778
What the hell?

38:08.240 --> 38:09.340
Will!

38:18.418 --> 38:19.484
Come on...

38:28.928 --> 38:29.828
Magnus.

38:29.830 --> 38:30.995
Hello.

38:32.465 --> 38:33.965
Where's your flashlight?

38:33.967 --> 38:36.000
It's dead.

38:45.245 --> 38:47.780
What the hell did you find?

38:47.782 --> 38:52.786
This is what's
in the water.

38:52.788 --> 38:55.923
Now let's get
the hell out of here.

39:03.932 --> 39:06.166
You sure I can't just
go cold Turkey?

39:06.168 --> 39:09.469
Your organs would
go into shock.

39:09.471 --> 39:11.337
The accelerated healing
you experienced

39:11.339 --> 39:13.005
robbed your body of nutrients,

39:13.007 --> 39:14.474
left you in worse shape

39:14.476 --> 39:17.476
than when you were
first wounded.

39:17.478 --> 39:19.945
So you're going to
shoot me up again.

39:19.947 --> 39:23.149
This diluted solution
won't supercharge you.

39:23.151 --> 39:25.318
It'll simply maintain
normal function.

39:25.320 --> 39:27.487
And we'll have to
keep it going

39:27.489 --> 39:28.621
on a regular basis

39:28.623 --> 39:29.956
until we can
flush your system.

39:33.963 --> 39:35.930
This remind you of anyone?

39:35.932 --> 39:37.332
A certain literary figure?

39:37.334 --> 39:40.535
Your hero,
Sherlock Holmes?

39:40.537 --> 39:43.204
And his
seven percent solution.

39:51.546 --> 39:52.913
You know, we could just...

39:54.149 --> 39:56.250
declare amnesty.

39:58.621 --> 40:00.589
Forget about everything we said.

40:02.492 --> 40:04.460
Amnesty, yes.

40:04.462 --> 40:06.462
Forgetting? No.

40:08.432 --> 40:10.500
Look, Will, you need
to understand,

40:10.502 --> 40:17.474
you were never part
of some master plan.

40:17.476 --> 40:20.443
I may have
a long view of things now,

40:20.445 --> 40:21.745
but the first time 'round,

40:21.747 --> 40:23.012
I was taking chances,
just like anyone.

40:24.415 --> 40:26.315
When I asked you
to come here,

40:26.317 --> 40:28.417
I had no idea

40:28.419 --> 40:31.153
if it would turn out to be
a brilliant move

40:31.155 --> 40:32.421
or a total disaster.

40:34.891 --> 40:35.891
And?

40:37.093 --> 40:39.528
Many disasters,

40:39.530 --> 40:40.963
most brilliant.

40:46.469 --> 40:48.637
I had 113 years

40:48.639 --> 40:52.608
of not knowing if I would ever
see any of you again.

40:52.610 --> 40:54.310
What if something
I'd done in the past

40:54.312 --> 40:55.444
had changed everything?

40:57.147 --> 40:58.581
But it didn't.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.452
Watching everything
unfold again,

41:02.454 --> 41:04.087
for better or worse.

41:04.089 --> 41:09.993
Watching every mistake I made
play out again.

41:09.995 --> 41:11.928
I had to let
terrible things happen, Will,

41:11.930 --> 41:16.199
and do nothing
to change them.

41:16.201 --> 41:18.935
I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy.

41:21.138 --> 41:23.673
Wow.

41:23.675 --> 41:25.041
Don't I feel like the jerk.

41:25.043 --> 41:27.377
You didn't know because
I didn't tell you.

41:27.379 --> 41:30.480
Because you carry
the whole weight yourself.

41:30.482 --> 41:31.714
I always have.

41:34.218 --> 41:35.652
I'm not your protege
anymore, Magnus.

41:35.654 --> 41:38.288
Not after everything
you said to me in the caves,

41:38.290 --> 41:40.991
you're not.

41:42.360 --> 41:44.061
I need to be your partner.

41:46.598 --> 41:48.299
Ah.

41:50.268 --> 41:51.702
And I think
