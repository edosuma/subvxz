WEBVTT

00:01.327 --> 00:03.357
And here's our latest

00:03.358 --> 00:05.230
Valentine's Cattleman's creation...

00:06.400 --> 00:08.493
..."The Rib-Eye Love You".

00:08.494 --> 00:10.714
It looks like you just
fused two steaks together

00:10.715 --> 00:12.817
to make a heart. That's
because I did, son.

00:12.818 --> 00:14.919
You can fuse anything
with enough butter.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.221
That's why you never shake
hands with a dairy farmer.

00:17.222 --> 00:20.257
You really went all out for
Valentine's Day this year, Dad.

00:20.258 --> 00:21.692
Well, that's because
your mom doesn't like it

00:21.693 --> 00:23.327
when I make a big deal about it at home,

00:23.328 --> 00:25.593
so I have to get my fix of
the holiday spirit here.

00:27.716 --> 00:29.500
Honey, you should be eating this

00:29.501 --> 00:31.285
in the comfort of your own home.

00:31.286 --> 00:33.237
Y'know, Eddie drives
Cattleman's To-Go now.

00:33.238 --> 00:36.540
Oh, I know. But I don't like
eating steak in front of Marvin.

00:36.541 --> 00:39.243
He always presses his finger
in it to test the done-ness.

00:39.244 --> 00:41.979
The man loves to touch
other people's food.

00:41.980 --> 00:45.049
Hey, Trent, what are you doing?
Where's the bow and arrow?

00:45.050 --> 00:48.069
The bear's supposed to be Cupid,
not a medieval vampire hunter.

00:48.070 --> 00:50.571
The guy at the sporting goods store
said if Cupid used one of these,

00:50.572 --> 00:53.024
he could make people fall in love
with more precision and power.

00:53.025 --> 00:54.746
Hmm.

00:56.150 --> 00:59.330
My first Valentine's Day with
a girlfriend. I can't wait!

00:59.331 --> 01:01.198
Me, neither. I have three dates!

01:01.936 --> 01:03.251
One for each meal of the day.

01:03.252 --> 01:04.367
You guys are suckers.

01:04.369 --> 01:06.487
Instead of blowing money
on candy and roses,

01:06.488 --> 01:08.439
I'll be spending it at the arcade,

01:08.440 --> 01:10.074
investing in "Mortal Kombat".

01:10.075 --> 01:11.173
Finish him!

01:11.898 --> 01:14.462
I couldn't be happier to be single.

01:18.534 --> 01:20.151
Hey, I'm single,

01:20.152 --> 01:22.336
my sisters Trish, Tina,
and Trudy are single,

01:22.337 --> 01:23.787
and we're all very happy.

01:23.788 --> 01:25.089
The key is keeping the bar low.

01:25.090 --> 01:27.375
Hey, Eddie. You can work on the 14th.

01:27.376 --> 01:28.855
You've got nothing going on, right?

01:28.856 --> 01:30.327
Big delivery day.

01:30.328 --> 01:32.113
Couples who stay in
aren't making dinner.

01:32.114 --> 01:33.886
They're making hot...

01:35.322 --> 01:37.122
...m-m-m-emories.

You have five seconds to compete
with an angry ghost car.

02:03.178 --> 02:05.179
Okay, decorating Cattleman's
has got me thinking...

02:05.180 --> 02:06.347
I know we already have

02:06.348 --> 02:08.014
the perfect Valentine's Day tradition...

02:08.015 --> 02:09.183
- Doing our taxes...
- Time!

02:09.184 --> 02:11.118
Sorry, this Plymouth's
about to eat a kid.

02:11.119 --> 02:13.843
But what if we spice it up this year?

02:13.844 --> 02:16.791
Oh, you mean like claiming
extra dependents?

02:16.792 --> 02:18.359
Louis, I'm blushing!

02:18.360 --> 02:20.861
Actually, I was thinking
of bringing a third party

02:20.862 --> 02:22.964
- into this relationship.
- What?!

02:22.965 --> 02:24.365
An accountant.

02:24.366 --> 02:25.666
Fat chance.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.168
Hear me out. It'll pay for itself,

02:27.169 --> 02:29.370
and it'll give us time to try
dinner and a movie this year.

02:29.371 --> 02:31.205
Louis, there's nothing more romantic

02:31.206 --> 02:32.873
than cheating the
government out of money.

02:32.874 --> 02:34.300
That's what we're doing this year.

02:34.301 --> 02:35.876
Case closed.

02:35.877 --> 02:38.546
Mommy, would you mind helping
me with this Half-Windsor knot?

02:38.547 --> 02:39.747
Y'know, Evan,

02:39.748 --> 02:41.616
you don't have to go to
your mom for everything.

02:41.617 --> 02:43.818
I can help you with your tie.
I'm wearing one right now.

02:43.819 --> 02:45.453
That's okay. I trust Mommy.

02:45.454 --> 02:47.822
Look, I know you're a "Mommy Guy",

02:47.823 --> 02:50.224
but some things dads
live to weigh in on...

02:50.225 --> 02:52.226
Shortcuts, types of charcoal,

02:52.227 --> 02:54.228
seeing a plane in the sky and
guessing where it's going.

02:54.229 --> 02:55.730
Louis, he's a smart kid.

02:55.731 --> 02:59.699
He knows who to go to
when he needs help... me.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.934
Northwest 727 to Detroit.

03:07.662 --> 03:09.844
What's this? We're renting the moose?

03:09.845 --> 03:11.979
Oh, Louis.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.714
Delivery receipts for the week.

03:13.715 --> 03:17.051
I had a nosebleed in the car
today, so some of those are...

03:17.052 --> 03:19.053
Well, you'll see.

03:19.054 --> 03:20.645
Whoa. There's a note in here.

03:20.646 --> 03:23.351
"To the Delivery Boy, you
don't just deliver food,

03:23.352 --> 03:25.559
you deliver hope that one
day we will be together.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.232
- Xoxo."
- What?

03:27.233 --> 03:29.220
X's and O's stand for kisses and hugs.

03:29.221 --> 03:30.598
I know that! But who?

03:30.599 --> 03:32.461
Someone you delivered to
must've slipped it in.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.435
Sounds like you got
yourself a secret admirer

03:34.436 --> 03:35.603
for Valentine's Day, buddy.

03:35.604 --> 03:37.038
You gotta find out who it is.

03:37.039 --> 03:39.907
I took this job for the cash,
not the anonymous love.

03:39.908 --> 03:41.442
Fair enough, it's your note...

03:41.443 --> 03:42.777
Fine! Geez, you win.

03:42.778 --> 03:44.111
If I find out who has a crush on me,

03:44.112 --> 03:45.331
will you get off my back, already?

03:45.332 --> 03:46.896
Whoa, easy, young buck.

03:46.897 --> 03:48.716
Ugh, and if it makes you
happy, I'll go door-to-door

03:48.717 --> 03:50.635
to see if my admirer's a
young attractive lady,

03:50.636 --> 03:52.553
and if we have a connection, so be it.

03:52.554 --> 03:54.070
Whatever gets you off my back!

03:57.456 --> 03:59.160
You sure you can't sit
with my brother and me?

03:59.161 --> 04:02.446
Sorry. Diane sprouted a
small but mighty zit,

04:02.447 --> 04:04.348
and she needs us to
pretend it's not there.

04:04.349 --> 04:06.528
The jaws of puberty unclench for no one.

04:06.529 --> 04:07.928
Okay, see you in Science.

04:08.909 --> 04:10.738
Big fan of all this.

04:10.739 --> 04:13.118
So... how do you plan
on asking Sicily out?

04:13.119 --> 04:14.825
I'm just gonna ask her.

04:14.826 --> 04:16.459
You can't just "ask" out a girl anymore.

04:16.461 --> 04:18.411
Ever since Adam Block used the PA system

04:18.413 --> 04:20.214
to invite Beth Hopkins to Bennigan's,

04:20.214 --> 04:22.555
things have escalated.
You've gotta go big.

04:22.556 --> 04:25.453
I wore a tie today. I
think I'll be fine.

04:25.454 --> 04:26.770
Look!

04:30.292 --> 04:31.559
Holy smokes!

04:31.560 --> 04:33.344
- That's what boys have been doing?
- Yep.

04:33.345 --> 04:35.262
It's a full-blown romantic arms race.

04:40.977 --> 04:42.002
Hey, Eddie!

04:42.003 --> 04:43.799
Nice to know someone in
your family still knocks.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.273
Hey, so I got a love note from
someone on my delivery route,

04:46.274 --> 04:48.240
and you're the first house on my list.

04:48.241 --> 04:50.878
Um, you think I wrote you a love note?

04:50.879 --> 04:53.864
No, this is just a formality.
Obviously it wasn't you.

04:53.865 --> 04:55.532
But it wouldn't be the craziest thing.

04:55.533 --> 04:58.152
I mean, you did let me
give you that sensual hug

04:58.153 --> 05:00.447
to impress my friends at that
block party four years ago.

05:00.448 --> 05:02.323
I forgot all about that.

05:02.324 --> 05:03.958
Yeah, yeah, me too.

05:03.959 --> 05:06.006
I never thought about it
again until just now.

05:07.326 --> 05:08.679
Well, Eddie,

05:08.680 --> 05:09.830
of course I didn't write the note,

05:09.831 --> 05:11.448
but I'd love to take a look at it.

05:11.449 --> 05:13.417
There's nothing I like
more than a good mystery.

05:13.418 --> 05:15.269
I'm no stranger to Nancy Drew, you know.

05:15.270 --> 05:16.327
Huh.

05:16.328 --> 05:18.639
So you think this Nancy Drew
girl could have written it?

05:18.640 --> 05:20.604
Oh, boy. Hmm.

05:20.605 --> 05:23.815
I think you're gonna need all
the help you can get. Come on.

05:25.185 --> 05:27.581
Do you remember my mom going to Branson?

05:27.582 --> 05:29.250
According to this Amtrak receipt,

05:29.251 --> 05:30.673
she was there for three weeks.

05:30.674 --> 05:32.669
Well, the middle school boys
have really done it to me now!

05:32.670 --> 05:34.471
Who hurt you? I just need
a name and an address.

05:34.472 --> 05:36.039
Mommy will take care of the rest.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.893
No, I just need to ask Sicily
out in a big, memorable way.

05:38.894 --> 05:40.333
Oh, well in that case...

05:40.334 --> 05:42.026
Actually, I want to
talk to Dad about this.

05:42.027 --> 05:43.330
Yes! Louis!

05:44.549 --> 05:47.447
I guess I can squeeze you in. Talk
to me, talk to me, talk to me.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.837
Evan, I got this. I can
help you with anything.

05:49.838 --> 05:52.473
No offense, Mommy, but
you're terrible at romance.

05:52.474 --> 05:55.443
Me? Terrible? Oh no.

05:55.444 --> 05:57.778
The bullies must have concussed you.

05:57.779 --> 05:59.314
I'll make you some soup.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.849
Jessica, it sounds like his
brain is working just fine.

06:01.850 --> 06:04.518
He knows who to go to
when he needs help... me.

06:04.519 --> 06:06.654
Now, before I help, I
need to know one thing.

06:06.655 --> 06:08.489
Can you hold a boombox over your head

06:08.490 --> 06:10.024
for the length of a Peter Gabriel song?

06:10.025 --> 06:12.159
Not "Sledgehammer", it goes on forever.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.327
Well, that's the point of the...

06:13.328 --> 06:14.401
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

06:14.402 --> 06:15.796
I'm here now. Daddy's here.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.375
Thanks so much for helping
with Sicily, Dad.

06:21.376 --> 06:24.231
I know you'll come up with a
memorable way for me to ask her out.

06:24.232 --> 06:26.500
No, son, we'll come up
with a memorable way.

06:26.501 --> 06:28.519
Now, I'm gonna need you to
make me a bio on her...

06:28.520 --> 06:30.304
Height, weight, blood type,

06:30.305 --> 06:32.039
favorite Thundercat... the usual stuff.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.474
I'm pretty sure she's O Positive

06:33.475 --> 06:35.109
but I'll confirm with her pediatrician!

06:35.110 --> 06:36.427
Hmm.

06:37.912 --> 06:40.873
Do you really think you can
help Evan better than I can?

06:40.874 --> 06:43.592
Probably. Unlike you, I love romance.

06:43.593 --> 06:45.986
You stood up and booed at the
end of "Sleepless in Seattle".

06:45.987 --> 06:48.575
I've been to Seattle several
times and slept fine.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.324
And yesterday, you turned down my idea

06:50.325 --> 06:51.646
for a real Valentine's date.

06:51.647 --> 06:53.927
Just because I don't
like being suffocated

06:53.928 --> 06:56.554
with stupid pink hearts
and sex potions...

06:56.555 --> 06:57.361
Sex potions?

06:57.362 --> 06:59.767
...doesn't mean I don't
understand romance.

06:59.768 --> 07:03.267
I'm good at everything I do
even if I don't like doing it.

07:03.268 --> 07:05.243
I don't wear a tie, but I pick yours,

07:05.244 --> 07:06.874
and I taught Evan how to tie his.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.559
Look, Evan chose me. He's in good hands.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.234
Why don't you talk to Grandma
and solve one of her problems?

07:12.235 --> 07:15.549
_

07:16.951 --> 07:18.919
Okay, what's your plan?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.623
Plan? Why would I need a plan?
I'm just gonna wing it.

07:21.624 --> 07:23.876
Eddie, this person wrote
to you from the shadows.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.443
Classic shadow lover.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.844
You need to go in with a little finesse.

07:26.845 --> 07:28.128
That's not my game.

07:28.129 --> 07:29.430
I just drive straight to the hoop,

07:29.431 --> 07:30.997
head down, and hope somebody fouls me.

07:30.998 --> 07:32.566
Who would foul you here?

07:32.567 --> 07:33.553
Please.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.636
I can't explain this and basketball.

07:35.637 --> 07:38.889
She wrote you an anonymous love
note, so she's obviously shy.

07:38.890 --> 07:41.659
You have to tread lightly. Draw her out.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.578
Timid hearts, soft hands, can't lose.

07:44.579 --> 07:46.697
Tell you what, when you
get a secret admirer,

07:46.698 --> 07:48.733
we'll do it your way. Watch and learn.

07:51.175 --> 07:54.004
Hi, are there any teenage
females living here?

07:54.005 --> 07:55.473
Just one.

07:55.474 --> 07:57.007
Susan!

07:58.027 --> 07:59.744
Sic 'em!

07:59.745 --> 08:00.884
Susan's coming!

08:00.885 --> 08:02.951
- I have bacon in my pocket!
- What?!

08:04.179 --> 08:05.749
Your science fair idea is cute.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.669
But if you really want a
home run Valentine's date,

08:08.670 --> 08:10.347
look no further...

08:10.348 --> 08:13.287
I feel like we should hug
after we get results, Dad?

08:13.288 --> 08:15.476
No, I'm... I'm gesturing to Cattleman's!

08:15.477 --> 08:18.587
The most romantic steakhouse in
Orlando this side of the monorail.

08:18.588 --> 08:21.248
So you're saying I should have
my date here at Cattleman's?

08:21.249 --> 08:22.953
Hey-hey. Hi! You with me?

08:22.954 --> 08:24.502
I'm trying to build something here.

08:24.503 --> 08:27.054
I give you lucky Table 12.

08:27.946 --> 08:30.124
That table is 8 for 8 in proposals

08:30.125 --> 08:31.931
and a guarantee of a romantic evening.

08:31.932 --> 08:34.505
See how the carpet is frayed
right besides that chair?

08:34.506 --> 08:37.248
That's from all the men getting
down on their knees to propose.

08:37.249 --> 08:38.549
Really?

08:38.549 --> 08:41.135
- That table?
- I know it doesn't look like much,

08:41.135 --> 08:42.602
but there is magic in that wood.

08:42.604 --> 08:44.889
That table was used on
the set of "Casablanca".

08:44.890 --> 08:46.434
- I was told.
- Intriguing.

08:46.435 --> 08:48.942
But is a table really going to compete

08:48.943 --> 08:50.511
with an upside-down boy on a rope?

08:50.512 --> 08:52.129
Um, do you know the last people

08:52.130 --> 08:53.998
who sat at that table
on Valentine's Day?

08:55.650 --> 08:58.452
- Three, two...
- I can't wait another second.

08:58.453 --> 09:02.308
Nancy, will you leave here forever

09:02.309 --> 09:04.491
and spend the rest of your life with me?

09:04.492 --> 09:07.349
I've already cleaned out the register.

09:12.317 --> 09:13.335
Mwah!

09:18.390 --> 09:20.073
See you guys tomorrow.

09:20.074 --> 09:22.509
- Oh, so that's where they went.
- Mm-hmm.

09:22.510 --> 09:24.295
I'm not looking to get
married quite yet,

09:24.296 --> 09:25.445
but that sounds great.

09:25.446 --> 09:27.231
Perfect, so the date is taken care of.

09:27.232 --> 09:29.249
Now we have to work on how
you're going to ask her out.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.351
Tell me how you two met. Don't
tell me she was engaged

09:31.352 --> 09:32.477
to your best friend.

09:32.478 --> 09:35.689
It was in science class.
We were dissecting frogs.

09:35.690 --> 09:37.211
Classic meet cute. Go on.

09:37.212 --> 09:39.760
She had some toe-webbing on
her shirt, I wiped it off,

09:39.761 --> 09:42.329
our eyes met, and my heart
danced the dance of the gods.

09:42.330 --> 09:44.366
Oh. Now, that's something we can use.

09:44.367 --> 09:47.373
Well, Louis, you said I couldn't
do it, but I found a man.

09:47.374 --> 09:49.303
- What?
- This is Kurt.

09:49.304 --> 09:50.671
I picked him up off the street.

09:50.672 --> 09:54.058
You see, Evan, Mommy is not
so terrible at romance.

09:54.059 --> 09:56.327
You have a kid? That's cool.

09:56.328 --> 09:57.862
Do you know how I picked Kurt up?

09:57.863 --> 10:00.798
Not with your father's mushy
Valentine's nonsense.

10:00.799 --> 10:02.649
You have a husband? That's cool.

10:02.650 --> 10:03.917
It is cool, Kurt.

10:03.918 --> 10:06.053
You see, I did some research,

10:06.054 --> 10:08.005
and the thing we call "love"

10:08.006 --> 10:09.974
is really just chemicals in the brain.

10:09.975 --> 10:11.059
You don't say?

10:11.060 --> 10:12.810
Kurt was riding his bike by my car,

10:12.811 --> 10:14.261
so I clipped him with my door...

10:14.262 --> 10:16.547
...activating a surge of adrenaline.

10:16.548 --> 10:18.415
This triggered his love response.

10:18.416 --> 10:19.666
Science!

10:19.667 --> 10:23.425
And you know who helps
you with science? Me.

10:25.229 --> 10:26.624
I love this family.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.375
I can't wait for the holidays.

10:28.376 --> 10:29.843
Uh, Kurt, if you wanna
hit the soda machine,

10:29.844 --> 10:31.795
- I'll get to you in a second.
- You want one, baby?

10:31.796 --> 10:33.364
Extra ice.

10:33.365 --> 10:36.338
Evan, love isn't about chemicals.

10:36.339 --> 10:38.402
It's about the magical
connection you have

10:38.403 --> 10:40.187
with someone.

10:40.188 --> 10:42.923
Really, Louis? No, Valentine's Day

10:42.924 --> 10:45.225
is all about adrenaline and danger.

10:45.226 --> 10:48.245
Roses with thorns,
diabetes from chocolate,

10:48.246 --> 10:50.230
a chubby man-child holding a weapon.

10:50.231 --> 10:54.118
That's why people go on
dates at amusement parks.

10:54.119 --> 10:56.236
- The rush.
- The rush?

10:56.237 --> 10:58.338
- So I need to spike Sicily's adrenaline?
- Yes.

10:58.339 --> 11:00.774
And what better way to do that

11:00.775 --> 11:04.912
than the scariest roller
coaster at Thrill City?

11:04.913 --> 11:07.264
Johnnie Cochran got them
out of four wrongful

11:07.265 --> 11:08.899
decapitation lawsuits.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.617
"No head, not dead."

11:10.618 --> 11:12.552
Come on, Evan, you're not buying this.

11:12.553 --> 11:14.988
I'm sorry, Dad. I can't
argue with science...

11:14.989 --> 11:16.774
After all, that's how I met Sicily.

11:16.775 --> 11:18.558
Looks like we're done here.

11:18.559 --> 11:20.847
Maybe there's something you
can help Grandma with.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.984
I missed you so much.

11:28.002 --> 11:29.509
Now, remember the last house?

11:29.510 --> 11:31.104
You can't just go up and ask.

11:31.105 --> 11:33.223
We need a cover story or
people get weirded out.

11:33.224 --> 11:35.142
So just follow my lead.

11:35.143 --> 11:36.655
Hello!

11:36.656 --> 11:39.513
I'm Swifty Lazar and
this is Lew Wasserman.

11:39.514 --> 11:41.124
'Ello!

11:41.125 --> 11:42.933
We're Hollywood talent scouts

11:42.934 --> 11:44.568
looking for the next Britney Spears

11:44.569 --> 11:45.753
or Christina Aguilera.

11:45.754 --> 11:46.814
Preferably Britney.

11:46.815 --> 11:47.972
Oh!

11:47.973 --> 11:49.790
Well, this is Seraphina.

11:49.791 --> 11:51.578
Uh, she played baby JonBenét Ramsey...

11:51.579 --> 11:53.193
Played the hell out of it.

11:53.194 --> 11:54.494
Apparently cut for time.

11:54.495 --> 11:57.414
Oh, she does her own make-up.

11:57.415 --> 11:58.949
Wow.

11:58.950 --> 12:01.234
Howdy, ya'll. We have
here a monogrammed bible

12:01.235 --> 12:03.337
for a Miss... Uh, what
does that say, Rhett?

12:03.338 --> 12:04.655
I'm not sure, Sue-Ellen.

12:04.656 --> 12:05.772
I know it's for a girl, though.

12:05.773 --> 12:08.292
Aged 14-18, probably attractive.

12:09.744 --> 12:12.412
Okay. Just...

12:12.413 --> 12:15.148
Hi, there, we're... Oh,
good, you came back.

12:15.149 --> 12:17.339
I tipped you a $20,
meant to tip you a $5.

12:18.342 --> 12:20.375
That'll be $15, please.

12:24.642 --> 12:26.593
So... do you like roller coasters?

12:26.594 --> 12:28.996
Not really. Most rides kind of scare me.

12:28.997 --> 12:31.281
I throw up on people
movers at the airport.

12:31.282 --> 12:33.233
The rush. Perfect.

12:33.234 --> 12:36.003
Hi, Sicily! Ribbit!

12:36.004 --> 12:39.656
You know, the last time I saw you,
I was on a dissecting tray,

12:39.657 --> 12:43.710
and you and Evan had your
forceps in my spleen.

12:43.711 --> 12:44.978
Ribbit.

12:44.979 --> 12:46.230
What's happening?

12:46.231 --> 12:47.307
Dad?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.815
Well, I'm here to tell you,

12:48.816 --> 12:50.784
that when you took out my spleen,

12:50.785 --> 12:54.204
you also took your lab partner's heart.

12:54.205 --> 12:56.745
And what Evan wants to know is...

12:59.922 --> 13:01.534
Will you be my Valentine?

13:01.535 --> 13:03.480
Oh, my God! Of course, Evan!

13:03.481 --> 13:04.882
Aww!

13:05.957 --> 13:08.001
Now, that right there is an invitation

13:08.002 --> 13:11.216
for a romantic dinner at
Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse,

13:11.217 --> 13:13.557
where legs like mine are sautéed

13:13.558 --> 13:16.927
in a mouthwatering garlic butter sauce.

13:16.928 --> 13:20.964
We're, uh, on the I-4, right
past the old shoe factory.

13:22.425 --> 13:25.813
Alright. Bye.

13:32.993 --> 13:35.062
Hello, Thrill City? I
would like to request

13:35.063 --> 13:37.181
a roller coaster getting
stuck upside down.

13:37.182 --> 13:38.331
It's for my son.

13:38.332 --> 13:39.781
Sorry, Evan and Sicily

13:39.782 --> 13:42.089
already have plans for
a date at Cattleman's.

13:42.090 --> 13:43.987
- What?
- Thrill City's off.

13:43.988 --> 13:46.390
Evan's a romance guy.

13:46.391 --> 13:48.263
Ribbit.

13:51.663 --> 13:53.235
Only one more house.

13:53.236 --> 13:54.765
Yeah, and it's my buddy, Trent's.

13:54.766 --> 13:56.716
Oh, the little ginger boy
who works at Cattleman's

13:56.717 --> 13:58.185
and calls Louis "Hoss"? Yeah.

13:58.186 --> 14:00.571
But we can skip his house.
There's no reason to stop.

14:00.572 --> 14:02.673
Actually there is... my bladder.

14:02.674 --> 14:04.324
It's a-fulllll...

14:04.325 --> 14:05.692
I'm about to burst.

14:05.693 --> 14:07.144
I'm, like, more pee than woman...

14:07.145 --> 14:09.717
- Okay, I got it.
- Oh.

14:13.301 --> 14:14.935
We still haven't found my secret admirer

14:14.936 --> 14:16.253
and you're the last house on the list.

14:16.254 --> 14:17.521
Whoa, slow your roll, Eddie.

14:17.522 --> 14:18.839
I didn't write you the love note.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.792
I wouldn't fake being a secret
admirer just to cheer you up.

14:21.793 --> 14:22.877
What do you mean?

14:22.878 --> 14:24.328
I'm saying I didn't
write you a pity note.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.463
Sure, people feel sorry
for the lonely guy,

14:26.464 --> 14:27.714
they fake a note, cheer him up,

14:27.715 --> 14:29.500
but that's not my game.
I'm not the lonely guy!

14:29.501 --> 14:31.451
Well, you did take Valentine's Day

14:31.452 --> 14:32.936
pretty hard back at Cattleman's.

14:32.937 --> 14:34.621
We all felt kinda bad for you.

14:34.622 --> 14:35.956
You all felt bad?

14:35.957 --> 14:37.875
Yeah. Just ask Honey.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.961
Rubik's Cube in the bathroom, good idea.

14:40.962 --> 14:42.217
You ready, handsome?

14:43.746 --> 14:45.799
It was you. You wrote the note

14:45.800 --> 14:47.033
because you felt sorry for me.

14:47.034 --> 14:48.335
What are you talking about?

14:48.336 --> 14:49.769
You saw how bummed I was

14:49.770 --> 14:51.905
when my brothers were talking
about their Valentine's dates.

14:51.906 --> 14:54.424
Eddie, I don't feel sorry for you.

14:54.425 --> 14:56.560
You think I'm some big loser
who's gonna die alone!

14:56.561 --> 14:58.345
Well, a lot of great men died alone!

14:58.346 --> 15:00.313
Tupac, Biggie...

15:00.314 --> 15:02.432
Fat Joe if he doesn't
cut back on the sodium!

15:06.954 --> 15:09.406
Welcome to Cattleman's, young lovers.

15:09.407 --> 15:11.258
Bask in the romance.

15:12.301 --> 15:17.041
We're down to three wings,
so don't order the wings.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.683
Hey, uh, thanks for taking
down Mark's crossbow, Trent.

15:19.684 --> 15:22.292
What? I didn't take it down, hoss.

15:22.293 --> 15:24.688
This is a robbery!

15:24.689 --> 15:27.291
Men, protect your dates!

15:28.691 --> 15:30.544
Is this dinner and a show?

15:30.545 --> 15:32.616
Waiter, another scotch! You want one?

15:32.617 --> 15:35.399
You all should be feeling a
fight-or-flight response,

15:35.400 --> 15:38.018
triggering hormones that induce love!

15:38.019 --> 15:39.607
- Mom?
- Mrs. Huang?

15:40.675 --> 15:42.939
- What's going on, Evan?
- You two should be feeling

15:42.940 --> 15:45.943
lots of chemicals, simulating love.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.644
You're very lucky I showed up.

15:47.645 --> 15:49.196
Evan, this is weird.

15:49.197 --> 15:52.216
And not good-weird like
the man-frog you hired,

15:52.217 --> 15:53.550
just weird...

15:53.551 --> 15:55.519
I think I'm gonna go home.

15:58.527 --> 16:02.397
Well, uh... Thanks for
all the help, Mom.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.828
Evan...

16:08.658 --> 16:11.034
Uh, uh... How about that?!

16:11.035 --> 16:14.371
Cattleman's Theater, everybody!

16:14.372 --> 16:15.872
Uh... and now

16:15.873 --> 16:20.210
feast your ears on the vocal
stylings of our very own...

16:20.211 --> 16:21.878
Trent!

16:27.126 --> 16:30.721
♪ Oh, Danny boy ♪

16:30.722 --> 16:33.952
♪ The pipes, the pipes are calling ♪

16:33.953 --> 16:37.332
♪ From glen to glen ♪

16:38.702 --> 16:40.297
Keep going.

16:40.298 --> 16:43.204
♪ And down the mountainside ♪

16:49.706 --> 16:51.957
What's wrong? You and Kurt break up?

16:51.958 --> 16:53.443
Evan's already mad at me,

16:53.444 --> 16:55.994
I don't need you piling on
because I wooed a male stranger

16:55.995 --> 16:57.331
to prove you wrong.

16:57.332 --> 16:58.681
Well, all joking aside.

16:58.682 --> 17:00.298
Please deal with it because
he is calling here

17:00.299 --> 17:01.433
an unhealthy amount.

17:02.719 --> 17:04.353
Cattleman's Ranch, go for Trent.

17:04.354 --> 17:06.605
It's Kurt again. I-Is
my girlfriend there?

17:06.606 --> 17:08.212
Hey, you know Jess.

17:08.213 --> 17:10.266
Where's her head at?
She's so tough to read.

17:10.267 --> 17:12.531
But I love that about her. I've
always loved that about...

17:14.574 --> 17:16.999
Okay. Maybe I got carried away.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.734
I just wanted to prove that I
could be good at romance, too.

17:19.736 --> 17:22.820
Oh, why? You never
cared about it before.

17:22.821 --> 17:24.173
The last time I got you flowers,

17:24.174 --> 17:25.641
you took it back to the grocery store

17:25.642 --> 17:27.876
and exchanged it for a frozen
pack of chicken thighs.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.812
Fine, I don't care about romance.

17:29.813 --> 17:31.597
I care about Evan.

17:31.598 --> 17:33.517
And I didn't get to help him on this.

17:33.518 --> 17:34.983
Well, that's okay. I did.

17:34.984 --> 17:37.086
Yes, and you are a wonderful father,

17:37.087 --> 17:39.822
but Evan always comes
to me for everything.

17:39.823 --> 17:42.891
This was a big moment for
him and he didn't need me.

17:42.892 --> 17:44.626
It made me feel useless.

17:44.627 --> 17:46.395
I get it.

17:46.396 --> 17:48.597
It felt great when he
finally came to me.

17:48.598 --> 17:51.016
Probably why I went a
little overboard myself.

17:51.017 --> 17:52.651
I spent $470...

17:52.652 --> 17:53.785
- What?
- $40.

17:53.786 --> 17:55.992
I spent $40 on a frog costume.

17:56.928 --> 17:59.658
Jessica, you're not useless.

17:59.659 --> 18:01.409
He will always need you.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.228
This was one thing.

18:03.229 --> 18:05.681
He'll keep coming to you
just as he always has.

18:05.682 --> 18:08.217
And every now and then he
might not. And that's okay.

18:08.218 --> 18:09.668
How do I prevent that from happening?

18:09.669 --> 18:10.786
You can't.

18:10.787 --> 18:12.421
But trust me, as he gets older,

18:12.422 --> 18:14.740
there will be a few things that
you would rather I handle.

18:14.741 --> 18:18.410
Like, uh, the talk I had with
Eddie about "long showers".

18:18.411 --> 18:20.879
Oh, I appreciate you keeping
an eye on the water bill.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.180
Hmm.

18:22.181 --> 18:23.311
Exactly.

18:25.902 --> 18:28.337
Any teenage males living in this house?

18:28.338 --> 18:30.139
I hear how creepy that sounds now.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.857
You want to help me take
down this bag of chocolates?

18:31.858 --> 18:32.901
I'm married to a dentist.

18:32.902 --> 18:34.597
Mama's got to get her sugar on the DL.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.713
I promise I didn't write
you that love note, Eddie.

18:37.714 --> 18:40.036
I stopped dotting my 'I's
with hearts in my 20s.

18:41.393 --> 18:43.138
I'm sorry I freaked out in the car.

18:43.139 --> 18:46.554
Honestly, I'm just bummed to
be alone on Valentine's Day.

18:46.555 --> 18:47.723
Yeah, that's normal.

18:47.724 --> 18:48.786
When you're a teenager,

18:48.787 --> 18:51.810
Valentine's Day feels like the
biggest deal in the world.

18:51.811 --> 18:53.595
But the truth is, it's just another day.

18:53.596 --> 18:54.897
You're right.

18:54.898 --> 18:56.698
Prom is the day that matters forever.

18:56.699 --> 18:58.000
Hmm.

18:58.001 --> 18:59.484
And besides, you weren't alone.

18:59.485 --> 19:01.470
I had a blast driving
around town with you.

19:01.471 --> 19:03.922
Me too. Thanks.

19:03.923 --> 19:05.407
Hey, you didn't touch the Rubik's Cube

19:05.408 --> 19:06.575
in Trent's bathroom, did you?

19:06.576 --> 19:08.693
What? No... No way.

19:08.694 --> 19:09.845
I didn't touch anything.

19:09.846 --> 19:11.530
I hovered and flushed with my shoe.

19:17.175 --> 19:18.520
Evan, I made you breakfast.

19:21.090 --> 19:22.440
How are your eggs?

19:22.441 --> 19:24.026
I've had better.

19:24.027 --> 19:26.148
That's probably 'cause
I put poison in them.

19:26.149 --> 19:28.252
Say what?

19:28.253 --> 19:30.282
No, I didn't poison your eggs.

19:30.283 --> 19:33.218
I was just trying to get a
chemical response out of you

19:33.219 --> 19:36.321
so you would be ready
to accept my apology

19:36.322 --> 19:38.160
for ruining your Valentine's Day.

19:39.215 --> 19:40.525
So do you accept?

19:40.526 --> 19:41.577
Accept what?

19:41.578 --> 19:43.028
My apology.

19:43.029 --> 19:45.263
You didn't apologize. At all.

19:45.264 --> 19:46.617
So we're doing this?

19:48.145 --> 19:50.686
I'm sorry I ruined your Valentine's Day.

19:50.687 --> 19:52.177
You were right to go to your Dad.

19:52.178 --> 19:54.846
His ideas aren't always terrible.

19:54.847 --> 19:56.975
But when they are, you could
always come back to me.

19:56.976 --> 19:58.095
I know, Mommy.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.744
And you didn't ruin anything.

19:59.745 --> 20:01.246
Sicily and I spent the rest of the night

20:01.247 --> 20:02.781
hate-watching the high
school science fair.

20:02.782 --> 20:05.065
All the mistakes are
funny until you realize

20:05.066 --> 20:06.651
it's the future of our country.

20:06.652 --> 20:08.153
So we're okay?

20:08.154 --> 20:09.988
Yes, Mommy, we're okay.

20:09.989 --> 20:11.823
And you don't need to
pretend to poison me

20:11.824 --> 20:13.225
to get me to love you.

20:13.226 --> 20:16.261
Actually, there is something
I could use your help with.

20:16.262 --> 20:18.296
Alright, I'm back in the game!

20:18.297 --> 20:20.799
Sometimes when Sicily and I hug...

20:20.800 --> 20:22.438
Louis! Evan needs you!

20:25.720 --> 20:27.584
You know, it's a shame
we never figured out

20:27.585 --> 20:28.926
who your secret admirer is.

20:28.927 --> 20:31.730
I know. But in a way it's kind of fun

20:31.731 --> 20:34.024
having a mystery lover out there.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.825
Whoever she is.

20:41.399 --> 20:43.166
Tina, it's time for supper.

20:43.167 --> 20:44.539
You're supposed to knock!

20:44.540 --> 20:46.603
When I knock and you're
taking a nap, you get mad.

20:46.604 --> 20:47.604
I can't win!

20:47.605 --> 20:49.439
When's the last time I napped?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.829
This isn't Madrid!

20:50.830 --> 20:52.442
Did I say it was Madrid?

20:52.443 --> 20:54.704
I just put in 8 hours,
I don't need this.

20:55.397 --> 20:57.113
Close the door!

20:58.633 --> 21:01.380
