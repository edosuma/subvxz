you covered our behinds.

A few citizens posted footage

14:28.450 --> 14:29.869
Oh, great.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.247
Now we just have to get the gauntlet
away from the angry-slicing cyborg.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.915
That should be easy.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.962
Down, boy!
Be a good, hideous nightmare pet!

14:40.045 --> 14:42.089
[grunts]

14:42.172 --> 14:45.843
The cat circus was the strangest thing
I've ever seen? I take it back.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.012
[Mechanica] My pets have softened
you up enough.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.265
Time for the main course.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.517
[robotic chittering]

14:57.187 --> 15:00.524
Goodbye, Flex Fighters.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.238
Whoa!

15:11.243 --> 15:12.077
[grunts]

15:20.169 --> 15:21.670
[weapons charge]

15:21.754 --> 15:23.964
Oh, that's bad.
[they grunt]

15:27.718 --> 15:29.470
Whoo-hoo! Who's bad?

15:29.553 --> 15:32.806
You realize he's gonna gloat
about this forever.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.142
I'm alive enough to care,
so that's a plus.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.227
Let's make sure these people
can say the same.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.980
Dr. C says hi by the way.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.899
That's a lie. She's not that nice.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.573
But she designed these
just for you to overload your circuits!

15:49.657 --> 15:50.491
Uh!

15:53.869 --> 15:55.245
[people panicking]

15:58.207 --> 16:00.417
He's right. It's overloading her.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.337
But not quickly enough.
We need more...

16:03.420 --> 16:05.589
Firepower. Nice.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.676
We also need a gajillion dollars.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.303
Worth a shot.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.365
We've gotta get
all these innocent people clear!

16:31.448 --> 16:36.870
<i>No. Her gauntlet contains the InfoGem.</i>
<i>Focus on getting it at all costs.</i>

16:37.621 --> 16:40.040
[Blindstrike]<i> It's the only way</i>
<i>we can put an end to Rook.</i>

16:48.173 --> 16:49.133
[yells]

16:50.426 --> 16:51.468
[grunts]

16:53.345 --> 16:54.972
You dare touch me!

16:57.516 --> 16:58.642
Blindstrike!

16:59.560 --> 17:02.396
<i>I'm okay. Focus on getting that InfoGem.</i>

17:10.237 --> 17:11.947
[Jake] Power's low! Omni?

17:12.614 --> 17:13.866
[grunts]

17:15.034 --> 17:16.368
[electricity crackles]

17:19.329 --> 17:23.125
No. I can't be captured.

17:23.834 --> 17:24.918
[electronic chittering]

17:28.505 --> 17:29.465
[weapons charging]

17:30.591 --> 17:31.759
[people gasp]

17:36.388 --> 17:39.016
Wingspan, go high. Omni, support.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.896
<i>What are you doing?</i>

17:43.979 --> 17:46.857
<i>Save a few people now,</i>
<i>but risk losing the whole city?</i>

17:46.940 --> 17:50.819
<i>Get that InfoGem, and we stop Rook.</i>
<i>Use your heads.</i>

17:50.903 --> 17:54.573
"Use your heads"?
She doesn't know us at all.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.287
That's everybody. Great work.

18:02.122 --> 18:06.126
Tell me, did you give Kane
an iota of the trouble that you give me?

18:06.210 --> 18:09.713
You have no idea. Tons of iotas.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.548
You think this is funny?

18:11.632 --> 18:14.843
We have a duty to a whole city,
not just individuals.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.595
You need to trust me.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.307
At last, there you are.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.977
Mechanica's gauntlet.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.563
At least someone here follows orders.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.565
But... how?

18:28.649 --> 18:32.027
While you were busy with bystanders,
I caught up with Mechanica.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.322
With this, we can put an end
to Rook's plans for an army.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.491
No, we can't.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.576
[regular beeping]

18:39.660 --> 18:42.496
No InfoGem?
Just a transmission repeater?

18:42.579 --> 18:45.833
Rook intentionally manipulated
the signal to make it seem like

18:45.916 --> 18:47.918
what we wanted
was in his metal monstrosity.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.797
If Stretch, Wingspan and Omni-Mass
had abandoned those innocents

18:51.880 --> 18:54.258
to get this empty shell,
then people would have been injured,

18:54.341 --> 18:56.176
or worse, for nothing.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.304
If we're gonna work together,
we have to trust each other.

18:59.388 --> 19:03.225
If you want the Flex Fighter's trust,
we need to tell them the truth.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.269
Wait, what truth?

19:06.186 --> 19:09.690
About how you got your powers.
You think it was accidental.

19:09.773 --> 19:13.777
While on a mission, I was exposed
to the chemical agent in Hyper-Flexarium,

19:13.861 --> 19:15.737
then went to school the next day.

19:16.905 --> 19:20.701
<i>Unknowingly, I exposed</i>
<i>everyone in Mr. Savic's class.</i>

19:23.412 --> 19:26.456
Because you three were then exposed
to pure Flexarium,

19:26.540 --> 19:28.208
the chemical agents mixed,

19:28.292 --> 19:31.044
resulting in the powers
you three now possess.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.006
That's why Rook
hasn't been able to duplicate us?

19:34.089 --> 19:36.466
He doesn't know about Riya
contaminating our class.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.595
Correct. It was a tiny window of exposure.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.348
So you're partially responsible
for creating us?

19:43.432 --> 19:45.434
I'm sorry I didn't come clean sooner,

19:45.517 --> 19:48.687
but it's what we do with the hand
we're dealt that matters most.

19:48.770 --> 19:53.817
You know how much I wanna bring down Rook.
But maybe the Flex Fighters are right.

19:53.901 --> 19:57.362
If we focus on our goals at all costs,
we'll lose the chance to help people.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.740
And that makes us too much like Rook.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.627
Hey, Nathan.
Thanks so much for coming to the show.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.794
It was so much fun.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.172
Sorry if it didn't work out
like you wanted.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.633
- What do you mean?
- Your cats.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.093
They only did, like, half their tricks.

20:20.677 --> 20:24.097
Getting the cats to do
half their tricks is a huge win.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.767
We did a show once
where none of the tricks worked.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.894
Someone in the audience
brought a fish sandwich.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.437
I got so charged up at that jerk.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.899
If you know most tricks
aren't gonna work out, why do it?

20:33.982 --> 20:37.653
Because when it does work out,
it's that much sweeter.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.614
Look, I make a plan,
but the cats do what they want.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.742
Sometimes the best things in life
are unplanned.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.874
- Are you... eating with us?
- Do I need a permission slip?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.878
I've had some thoughts.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.880
Even though I'm used
to doing botany alone,

20:56.964 --> 21:00.133
I guess sometimes a little teamwork
couldn't hurt my chances

21:00.217 --> 21:01.802
at becoming better at...

21:01.885 --> 21:04.137
Botany. Yeah, we get it.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.515
We're better with you too.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.986
Time to heal. But don't worry.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.488
You'll get another chance
at the Flex Fighters.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.075
This is far from over.
