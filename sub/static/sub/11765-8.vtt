WEBVTT

00:01.232 --> 00:02.433
I HEARD THIS GREAT JOKE
AT WORK.

00:02.433 --> 00:03.634
YOU WORK?

00:03.634 --> 00:05.306
SHUSH IT.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.178
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU CALL
A PASTRY CHEF WITH NO ARMS?

00:07.178 --> 00:09.340
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
MY FRIEND AMANDA?

00:09.340 --> 00:10.781
YEAH, SHE CAN'T BE
A CHEF ANYMORE

00:10.781 --> 00:13.314
SINCE SHE LOST HER ARMS
IN THAT PILATES ACCIDENT.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.346
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
MAKE JOKES SO SAD?

00:15.346 --> 00:17.548
THIS WILL CHEER YOU UP.
I HAVE REALLY GOOD NEWS.

00:17.548 --> 00:18.749
ARE YOU STERILE?

00:18.749 --> 00:20.421
WADE AND I
ARE MOVING IN TOGETHER.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.193
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

00:22.193 --> 00:24.325
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.696
READY TO COMMIT
AND HANDSOME?

00:25.696 --> 00:27.758
YOU ARE THE TOTAL PACKAGE,
MAN.

00:27.758 --> 00:29.430
YOU ALREADY HAVE
A BEST FRIEND.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.062
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T LOOK.

00:31.062 --> 00:32.263
(chuckles) OKAY.

00:32.263 --> 00:33.634
WELCOME TO THE GANG,
WADE.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.266
I ONLY JOINED THIS CREW
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

00:35.266 --> 00:37.568
HUGE HONOR. DON'T BLOW IT.

00:37.568 --> 00:38.769
OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,

00:38.769 --> 00:40.271
WE ARE OUT OF WINE.

00:40.271 --> 00:42.213
AND AS THE NEWEST MEMBER--

00:42.213 --> 00:43.414
I WILL BUY SOME WINE.

00:43.414 --> 00:44.715
SO, UH, WHAT, TWO BOTTLES?

00:44.715 --> 00:46.217
(all laugh)

00:46.217 --> 00:48.219
TWO BOTTLES.
THREE BOTTLES?

00:48.219 --> 00:50.581
OH, MY GOD. STOP IT.
(laughing continues)

00:50.581 --> 00:55.626
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:55.626 --> 00:57.558
HEY, GUYS.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.491
TOM'S WORRIED SINCE HE'S
NO LONGER THE GROUP NEW GUY.

01:00.491 --> 01:02.133
HE NEEDS A DIFFERENT ROLE.

01:02.133 --> 01:03.464
GROUP WEIRDO?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.136
GROUP PARROT FACE?

01:05.136 --> 01:07.268
GROUP GUY WHO'S NOT
REALLY IN THE GROUP?

01:07.268 --> 01:09.170
BUT I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE
A-A GROUP CHEERLEADER.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.242
SOMEONE WHO COULD
MAKE US FEEL SPECIAL.

01:11.242 --> 01:12.473
I'D ACTUALLY LOVE THAT.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.804
OH, NO.
IT'D JUST BE FOR ME.

01:13.804 --> 01:16.107
FANTASTIC IDEA, JULES.

01:16.107 --> 01:17.678
THANKS, TOM.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.610
(laughs) I AM NEVER
GONNA GET SICK OF THIS.

01:19.610 --> 01:21.152
(Laurie) YOU GUYS, WADE IS

01:21.152 --> 01:22.813
SUCH A GREAT PERSON.

01:22.813 --> 01:25.386
I REALLY THINK
THAT I WOULD LIKE HIM

01:25.386 --> 01:27.788
EVEN IF HE WASN'T BLACK.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.190
OOH.
OH, WOW.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.521
OHH.
YEAH.

01:30.521 --> 01:32.163
SO HOW DID TRAV TAKE IT
WHEN HE FOUND OUT

01:32.163 --> 01:33.524
YOU TWO WERE SHACKING UP?

01:33.524 --> 01:36.797
I HAVEN'T
REALLY TOLD HIM YET.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.130
EMERGENCY MEETING.
EVERYONE OUT EXCEPT LAURIE.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.531
WHAT?

01:40.531 --> 01:42.233
HEY. (speaks indistinctly)

01:42.233 --> 01:43.734
I'M WORRIED
OUR KID'S GETTING DUMBER.

01:43.734 --> 01:45.576
TODAY I CAUGHT HIM
IN THE TOILET

01:45.576 --> 01:47.178
WEARING GOGGLES.

01:47.178 --> 01:48.609
TAKE HIM SOMEWHERE
WHERE HE CAN LEARN SOMETHING,

01:48.609 --> 01:50.141
LIKE THE LIBRARY.

01:50.141 --> 01:51.342
MM.
DO IT.

01:51.342 --> 01:52.543
SURE. THAT'LL BE FUN.

01:52.543 --> 01:55.586
(motors whirring)

01:55.586 --> 01:57.218
MAN, I LOVE THE LIBRARY!

01:57.218 --> 01:58.419
YEE-HAW!

01:58.419 --> 02:00.651
SEE YA, SUCKERS.

02:00.651 --> 02:03.394
(laughs) HE FINALLY OUTGREW
HIS DEVIL BABY STAGE, HUH?

02:03.394 --> 02:05.526
YEAH, STAN'S BEEN
A REAL ANGEL.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.727
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.399
HE'S PLOTTING SOMETHING,

02:08.399 --> 02:09.830
SOMETHING BIG.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.132
NO.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.764
(hip-hop music playing)

02:13.764 --> 02:15.706
(man) в™Є YEAH в™Є

02:15.706 --> 02:18.409
WITH ALL THIS WADE STUFF,
I HAVE TO ASK,

02:18.409 --> 02:21.372
HOW COME YOU AND TRAVIS
NEVER HAPPENED?

02:21.372 --> 02:23.514
TRAV IS... AWESOME.

02:23.514 --> 02:25.846
YOU KNOW, HE'S SWEET

02:25.846 --> 02:27.848
AND HE'S SMART.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.820
BUT IT'S WEIRD.

02:29.820 --> 02:31.822
YOU KNOW, I SAW HIM
NAKED IN THE BATHTUB

02:31.822 --> 02:33.824
WHEN HE WAS, LIKE, 12.

02:33.824 --> 02:36.557
TO BE FAIR, HIS BODY HAS
CHANGED A LOT SINCE THEN.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.529
WH-WHY WOULD I...
(chuckles)

02:38.529 --> 02:41.161
WHAT IF THINGS WENT BAD

02:41.161 --> 02:42.493
BETWEEN ME AND TRAV?

02:42.493 --> 02:45.266
I MEAN,
IF I EVER HURT HIM...

02:45.266 --> 02:46.467
WELL, I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.798
(laughs) RIGHT.

02:47.798 --> 02:49.400
(laughs) NO, SERIOUSLY.
I WOULD KILL YOU.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.771
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

02:50.771 --> 02:52.403
AND I KNOW HOW
I'D GET AWAY WITH IT.

02:52.403 --> 02:55.175
MY GIRL IS SUPER SMART.
SHE CAN MURDER ANYONE.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.477
THANKS, TOM.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.279
OH, THANK YOU, JULES.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.211
I NEED YOU
TO BE HONEST WITH ME.

03:00.211 --> 03:01.912
IS OUR FRIENDSHIP
THE REASON WHY

03:01.912 --> 03:04.184
THE TWO OF YOU
HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOGETHER?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.686
SWEETIE...

03:05.686 --> 03:07.258
'CAUSE IT WOULD KILL ME
IF I EVER THOUGHT

03:07.258 --> 03:09.220
THAT I WAS KEEPING TRAVIS
FROM BEING HAPPY...

03:09.220 --> 03:10.591
OR YOU.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.324
YES, TRAVIS AND I
HAVE HAD...

03:13.324 --> 03:16.327
ALL OF THOSE
"ALMOST" MOMENTS.

03:16.327 --> 03:19.970
BUT IF IT WAS MEANT TO BE,
IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED, RIGHT?

03:19.970 --> 03:23.234
I JUST DON'T SEE US
EVER GETTING TOGETHER.

03:23.234 --> 03:25.576
I DON'T.

03:25.576 --> 03:27.538
SO YOU JUST MOVED IN
WITH THE GIRL

03:27.538 --> 03:29.480
THAT'S NEVER SAID "NO."

03:29.480 --> 03:31.712
I ASSUME THERE'S A LOT
OF SMACKING, FLIPPING,

03:31.712 --> 03:33.784
AND RUBBING IT DOWN,
OH, NO?

03:33.784 --> 03:36.787
YEAH, I ACTUALLY LIKE TO KEEP
OUR PRIVATE LIFE PRIVATE.

03:36.787 --> 03:38.719
(Grayson and Ellie laugh)

03:38.719 --> 03:40.220
SHE'S ALREADY TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.922
TOLD US, SHOWED US VIDEOS.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.256
BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE
AMAZING UPPER-BODY STRENGTH.

03:45.256 --> 03:47.258
AND BEAUTIFUL GLUTES.

03:47.258 --> 03:49.760
THIS, UM, WOULDN'T BE WEIRD
IF WE WERE AT A GYM.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.662
YES, IT WOULD.
YEAH.

03:51.662 --> 03:52.963
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER,

03:52.963 --> 03:54.605
I USED TO LET ANDY
HIT THIS CONSTANTLY.

03:54.605 --> 03:56.837
NOW IT'S ONLY ON SUNDAY
WHEN TOM MOWS HIS GRASS.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.369
THE SOUND OF THE MOWER COVERS

03:58.369 --> 04:01.241
THE WHEEZING AND GRUNTING NOISES
THAT ANDY MAKES.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.013
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.
WHERE?

04:03.013 --> 04:04.515
ANYWHERE.

04:04.515 --> 04:06.777
ONCE A WEEK
ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS?

04:06.777 --> 04:09.249
GIRL, YOU NASTY.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.682
YOU THINK JULES DOESN'T
TELL ME EVERYTHING?

04:11.682 --> 04:13.654
YOU GUYS ONLY GOT MARRIED
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

04:13.654 --> 04:16.657
AND YOU ONLY DO IT
ONE AND A HALF TIMES A WEEK.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.258
OH, YEAH?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.531
I HAVE NO COMEBACK TO THAT.

04:20.531 --> 04:22.262
ANOTHER EMERGENCY MEETING.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.295
WHY DO WE ONLY HAVE SEX
ONE AND A HALF TIMES A WEEK?

04:24.295 --> 04:27.267
ARE WE ALREADY OLD AND BORING,
AND WHAT'S THE HALF?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.400
THAT'S THAT THING I LET YOU
WATCH ME DO IN THE SHOWER.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.941
OH. OKAY, YEAH.
FAIR ENOUGH.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.404
ELLIE, DID YOU DO THIS?
YEP.

04:33.404 --> 04:34.705
WOULD IT MAKE IT BETTER

04:34.705 --> 04:36.977
IF TOMORROW, WE HAVE
THE SEXIEST DAY EVER?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.549
OOH, YEAH.

04:38.549 --> 04:39.880
FORGET ONE AND A HALF.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.652
WE'LL TURN THOSE HALVES
INTO WHOLES.

04:41.652 --> 04:43.984
OOH. IT'LL BE ALL WHOLES
ALL DAY.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.656
(laughs)

04:45.656 --> 04:46.887
DID I SAY SOMETHING FUNNY?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.819
NOT ON PURPOSE.

04:48.819 --> 04:51.692
OKAY, WHO'S GONNA TELL TRAVIS
ABOUT LAURIE AND WADE?

04:51.692 --> 04:53.864
I MEAN, THIS IS SENSITIVE,
SO I WANT TO LIMIT THIS

04:53.864 --> 04:56.527
TO THE PEOPLE
WHO REALLY NEED TO BE HERE.

04:56.527 --> 04:58.699
I MEAN, LAURIE, IT'S ABOUT YOU.
BOBBY, YOU'RE HIS DAD.

04:58.699 --> 05:02.072
GRAYSON, YOU'RE MY HUSBAND.
AND ELLIE'S MY ROCK.

05:02.072 --> 05:05.005
в™Єв™Єв™Є

05:05.005 --> 05:07.378
IT WOULD'VE BEEN EASIER
TO SAY "EVERYONE BUT ANDY."

05:07.378 --> 05:09.780
LOOK, BABE, IF YOU WANT ME
TO TELL TRAVIS,

05:09.780 --> 05:11.011
I WILL.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.683
THAT'S NOT SINCERE.

05:12.683 --> 05:14.585
NOPE.
JUST TRYING TO SCORE POINTS.

05:14.585 --> 05:16.617
OKAY, LET'S CUT
TO THE CHASE.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.519
IT'S CLEAR IT HAS TO BE EITHER
THE GIRL WHO BROKE HIS HEART

05:18.519 --> 05:19.850
OR THE SUFFOCATING MOM.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.652
(laughs) WOW. WHEN'D YOU
FINALLY REALIZE

05:21.652 --> 05:22.853
THAT YOU SUFFOCATE HIM?

05:22.853 --> 05:24.525
FRIDAY NIGHT.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.457
I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT MISSING HIM,

05:26.457 --> 05:28.959
AND WELL, LONG STORY SHORT,
I BROKE INTO HIS PLACE

05:28.959 --> 05:30.861
AND I CRAWLED INTO BED
WITH HIM.

05:30.861 --> 05:33.404
AND THEN HIS ROOMMATES
"CAUGHT US," AND WHATEVER.

05:33.404 --> 05:34.735
JUST BAD.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.966
AGAIN?

05:35.966 --> 05:37.568
I KNOW
I SHOULD BE THE ONE

05:37.568 --> 05:39.339
TO TELL TRAVIS.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.842
I JUST CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT
OF HURTING HIM.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.675
OH. MAYBE THAT'S THE ANSWER.

05:44.675 --> 05:47.418
MAYBE WE DO
SEXY TIMES ONCE,

05:47.418 --> 05:49.550
BUT I MAKE IT SO BAD

05:49.550 --> 05:52.583
THAT IT TAKES ALL OF THE MAGIC
OUT OF IT. RIGHT?

05:52.583 --> 05:57.027
ONLY, YOU GUYS, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN BE BAD IN BED.

05:57.027 --> 05:58.929
JELLY BEAN,

05:58.929 --> 06:02.032
YOUR HEAD HURTS WHEN YOU TRY
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, DOESN'T IT?

06:02.032 --> 06:04.635
IT ACTUALLY DOES.
(Jules) FINE.

06:04.635 --> 06:06.837
I'VE GOTTA GO TO HIS PLACE
AND GET MY MOUTH GUARD ANYWAY.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.068
I'LL DO IT.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.940
YOU'LL DO WHAT?

06:11.772 --> 06:14.004
START OUR QUIET CONTEST NOW.

06:14.004 --> 06:15.646
AND GO.

06:15.646 --> 06:18.148
(inhales deeply)

06:18.148 --> 06:21.612
YOU ROCK, JULES.
YOU'RE THE QUIETEST.

06:21.612 --> 06:22.813
SHH.

06:22.813 --> 06:25.486
(mouths words)

06:29.990 --> 06:31.422
YOU READY TO START
THE SEXIEST DAY EVER?

06:31.422 --> 06:33.724
LET'S DO THIS.

06:35.626 --> 06:37.898
WELCOME TO NAKED DAY.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.900
MM.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.772
DID YOU EVER NOTICE

06:41.772 --> 06:44.875
HOW MANY THINGS IN THIS HOUSE
ARE BOOB-HIGH?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.907
I ACTUALLY GRADUATED
FROM BOOB HIGH.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.408
REALLY?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.740
YOU'RE RIGHT.
NAKED DAY'S SERIOUS.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.582
COME ON.
LET'S HAVE SOME COFFEE.

06:51.582 --> 06:53.644
NOPE. I HAVE TO STAY
IN THIS SPOT.

06:53.644 --> 06:55.115
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
IN THE HOUSE

06:55.115 --> 06:57.688
WHERE THE LIGHT REALLY WORKS
ON A 43-YEAR-OLD BODY.

06:57.688 --> 06:58.889
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

06:58.889 --> 07:00.791
AWW, THANKS, HONEY,
BUT WATCH.

07:00.791 --> 07:03.123
"TOP MODEL."

07:03.123 --> 07:05.856
"TOP CHEF."

07:05.856 --> 07:07.698
OH, BABY!
(door opens)

07:07.698 --> 07:09.800
OH, BABY.
(door closes)

07:09.800 --> 07:11.001
MORNING.

07:11.001 --> 07:12.202
NICE TUSH.
OH.

07:12.202 --> 07:13.964
SERIOUSLY?

07:13.964 --> 07:15.205
CALM DOWN. I'VE SEEN
HER JUNK A MILLION TIMES.

07:15.205 --> 07:16.807
WE DECIDED THAT HER NIPPLES

07:16.807 --> 07:18.839
WOULD LOOK BETTER ON MY BOOBS
AND VICE VERSA.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.771
I'D HAVE TO SEE 'EM
SIDE BY SIDE.

07:20.771 --> 07:23.073
JULES IS ROCKIN'
THE BIRTHDAY SUIT.

07:23.073 --> 07:24.945
NOW WE HAVE A PARTY.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.547
THANKS, TOM. (laughs)

07:26.547 --> 07:28.479
WHOA. WHY ARE YOU
PUTTING ON YOUR ROBE?

07:28.479 --> 07:30.050
I'VE GOT A QUICK
EMERGENCY MEETING ABOUT TRAVIS,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.722
BUT I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

07:31.722 --> 07:33.784
NUDE, STANDING IN MY SPOT.

07:37.628 --> 07:40.130
YOU KNOW HOW GRAYSON
CALLS HIS CHEST "THE TRUTH"

07:40.130 --> 07:41.992
AND HIS BACK "JUSTICE"?

07:41.992 --> 07:44.865
WELL, I THINK HE SHOULD CALL
HIS JOHNSON "THE AMERICAN WAY."

07:44.865 --> 07:47.467
THAT'S GOLD, J-BIRD,
BUT WHY TELL ME?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.769
WELL, HE WON'T LET ME
NICKNAME IT.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.100
I THINK HE MIGHT
LET YOU DO IT.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.902
AH, I GOT YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

07:51.902 --> 07:53.473
I'LL BRING IT UP NEXT TIME
WE'RE AT A URINAL.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.975
I THOUGHT YOU CALLED
THIS EMERG MEETING

07:54.975 --> 07:56.877
TO HELP FIGURE OUT
HOW TO BREAK THE NEWS TO TRAV.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.949
HEY, JUST DON'T
CODDLE THE BOY, OKAY?

07:58.949 --> 08:00.851
HIT HIM
WITH THE HARSH TRUTH.

08:00.851 --> 08:03.984
BOBBY, YOU KNOW TRAVIS
DOESN'T HANDLE BAD NEWS WELL.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.256
REMEMBER LAST TIME,
HE TOOK OFF TO HAWAII.

08:06.256 --> 08:08.058
WHAT?

08:08.058 --> 08:09.720
YOU GUYS, THAT'S THE RIGHT
WAY TO SAY HAWAII.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.592
I DON'T CARE.
I STILL HATE IT.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.594
LOOK, WHENEVER I HAVE TO GIVE
CRAPPY NEWS TO TRAVIS,

08:13.594 --> 08:15.766
I LIKE TO GET HIM
IN A HAPPY PLACE

08:15.766 --> 08:16.967
SO HE CAN HANDLE IT.

08:16.967 --> 08:19.600
I USED TO HAVE
THE PERFECT SYSTEM.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.803
YOU FAILED KINDERGARTEN.

08:25.736 --> 08:27.708
YOU GAVE
THE WHOLE SCHOOL HEAD LICE.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.013
YOUR DAD AND I
ARE GETTING A DIVORCE.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.815
SHOCKER.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.047
DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

08:37.047 --> 08:38.248
STILL WANT TO GET
ICE CREAM?

08:38.248 --> 08:39.950
YOU KNOW IT.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.652
HUH.

08:41.652 --> 08:43.794
GRAYSON'S DOING DISHES
BUCK NAKED.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.033
NOT BAD.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.165
WHOSE DO YOU LIKE MORE,
MINE OR G-MAN'S?

08:55.165 --> 08:57.137
MM. SIXES.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.839
SIX AND A HALFS.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.611
MM.

09:00.611 --> 09:02.913
DAD, CAN YOU TOSS ME
MY CRAYONS?

09:02.913 --> 09:05.215
MAYBE DRAWING A PICTURE
WILL KEEP HIS MIND OFF

09:05.215 --> 09:07.778
WHATEVER HORRIBLE THING
HE'S PLOTTING.

09:07.778 --> 09:09.580
DON'T ASSUME THAT STAN'S
UP TO SOMETHING BAD.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.221
I MEAN, IF YOU EXPECT
THE WORST OUT OF KIDS,

09:11.221 --> 09:13.123
THEN THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA GET.

09:13.123 --> 09:15.185
HELL, MY PARENTS ALWAYS FIGURED
I'D DROP OUT OF COLLEGE,

09:15.185 --> 09:16.727
AND I DID.

09:16.727 --> 09:18.128
SO YOU'RE SAYING
IF THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE,

09:18.128 --> 09:19.660
YOU WOULD'VE GRADUATED?

09:19.660 --> 09:20.861
OH, WELL,
LET'S NOT GET CRAZY.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.062
SCHOOL'S FOR NERDS.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.034
OH, I DO NOT FEEL GOOD.

09:24.034 --> 09:27.037
(groans) THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS
WHENEVER I DISAGREE WITH YOU.

09:27.037 --> 09:28.769
(inhales deeply) YOU DON'T
KNOW MY KID, BOBBY.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.100
(strained voice)
YOU'RE WRONG.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.902
OH, I HAVE GOT TO LIE DOWN.

09:31.902 --> 09:34.304
FIRST JULES QUESTIONS
MY PARENTING, AND NOW YOU?

09:34.304 --> 09:36.647
I MEAN, I'M A GOOD PARENT,
DAMN IT.

09:36.647 --> 09:37.848
WHEN TRAVIS LOST A TOENAIL,

09:37.848 --> 09:39.279
YOU SUPER GLUED IT
BACK TO HIS FOOT

09:39.279 --> 09:40.911
AND STUCK
ALL OF HIS TOES TOGETHER.

09:40.911 --> 09:43.213
HE MADE THE SWIM TEAM,
DIDN'T HE?

09:43.213 --> 09:44.955
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
TRAVIS IS ON HIS WAY.

09:44.955 --> 09:47.157
NOW EVERYONE'S HERE
THAT NEEDS TO BE HERE.

09:47.157 --> 09:52.292
WE HAVE THE ROCK, THE DAD,
THE GIRL, THE HUSBAND...

09:52.292 --> 09:54.925
I GOT NOTHING.

09:54.925 --> 09:57.227
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I DON'T
GET TO BE PART OF TRAVIS' PAIN.

09:57.227 --> 09:59.169
OKAY, GUYS. IT'S SHOWTIME.
EVERYBODY ACT REALLY HAPPY.

09:59.169 --> 10:00.370
HAPPY.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.032
WELL, IF E-TRAIN DOES THAT...

10:02.032 --> 10:03.834
(chuckles)
HE'LL KNOW SOMETHING'S UP.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.676
GOOD POINT.
ELLIE, BE YOURSELF.

10:05.676 --> 10:07.337
HEY, EVERYONE.

10:07.337 --> 10:08.939
HEY, PALEFACE.

10:08.939 --> 10:10.741
HOW'S THE SUN FEEL
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

10:10.741 --> 10:13.013
THIS IS 50.
THIS IS YOU.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.686
LOOK HOW CLOSE THEY ARE.
(laughs)

10:15.686 --> 10:17.147
MAY I KILL HIM?

10:17.147 --> 10:19.650
SWEETIE! COME ON NOW.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.291
LET'S GO RACING!

10:26.096 --> 10:28.128
(tires squealing)

10:28.128 --> 10:30.160
(man) WHOO!
(laughs)

10:36.406 --> 10:39.209
AWW, STAN.

10:40.410 --> 10:43.273
(dramatic music playing)
AAH!

10:43.273 --> 10:46.216
NOT GOOD! NOT GOOD!
NOT GOOD!

10:46.216 --> 10:47.417
YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

10:47.417 --> 10:48.819
OH, YEAH.

10:48.819 --> 10:50.280
WHEN NAKED DAY
GETS PUT ON HOLD,

10:50.280 --> 10:52.052
WE KNOCK IT OUT
IN A PUBLIC BATHROOM.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.054
(chuckles)
THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.027
OKAY, NO ONE'S LOOKING.
LET'S GO. GO, GO, GO.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.660
MM. (laughs)
(laughs)

11:00.660 --> 11:01.962
EW! WHOO!

11:01.962 --> 11:04.364
THAT IS A SMELL I HAVE
NEVER SMELLED BEFORE.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.997
THAT'S LIKE A--THAT'S LIKE
A HOT STINK.

11:06.997 --> 11:09.740
UGH. OH, COME HERE.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.772
(both moaning)

11:11.772 --> 11:13.173
(laughs)

11:13.173 --> 11:16.146
OHH! OH! OH!

11:16.146 --> 11:17.748
WHAT?

11:17.748 --> 11:18.949
(strained voice)
YOU ZIPPED IT.

11:18.949 --> 11:20.280
OH, GOD.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.052
IT'S STUCK.
"THE AMERICAN WAY" IS STUCK.

11:22.052 --> 11:24.014
OH, DID BOBBY
TALK TO YOU?

11:24.014 --> 11:26.817
I THINK
I'M GONNA BLACK OUT.
OH.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.862
HOW'D IT GO IN THERE,
LOVER BOY?

11:31.862 --> 11:34.024
DIE.

11:34.024 --> 11:35.225
WHOO!

11:35.225 --> 11:36.696
(Travis) OH!

11:36.696 --> 11:37.898
(Bobby) WHOO!

11:37.898 --> 11:40.771
FINE. YOU WON.
BUT THAT WAS CLOSE.

11:40.771 --> 11:42.202
OH, PLEASE, CHILD.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.275
I WAS PUTTING LIPSTICK ON
WHEN I PASSED YOU.

11:45.275 --> 11:47.738
NO, SERIOUSLY. I WAS
PUTTING LIPSTICK ON. (laughs)

11:47.738 --> 11:51.141
I DON'T EVEN CARE.
THAT WAS SO FUN.

11:51.141 --> 11:53.013
WHY DON'T WE GO OUT
TO LUNCH AND TALK?

11:53.013 --> 11:55.115
(Wade) HEY, THERE YOU ARE.
HI.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.347
HEY, LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE HANGING
WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND ALL.
YEAH.

11:57.347 --> 11:58.949
BUT, UH, I DON'T KNOW MY WAY
AROUND YOUR TOWN STILL,

11:58.949 --> 12:00.390
AND I CAN'T FIND OUR PLACE.

12:00.390 --> 12:02.452
OH.
(chuckles)

12:02.452 --> 12:05.095
WAIT. YOU GUYS...
YOU GUYS MOVED IN TOGETHER?

12:05.095 --> 12:07.457
YEAH, WE DID, ACTUALLY.

12:07.457 --> 12:09.229
THAT'S GREAT.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.732
THAT'S, UH, YOU KNOW, GREAT.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.464
DID YOU GUYS HEAR THE NEWS?

12:17.467 --> 12:19.940
REALLY?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.772
IS THAT WHY WE'RE HERE?

12:21.772 --> 12:24.074
IS THIS JUST ANOTHER
COIN-OPERATED CAR?
(gears click)

12:24.074 --> 12:26.746
TRAVIS, LET ME EXPLAIN!

12:33.824 --> 12:35.025
WHOA! WHOA!
(tires squeal)

12:35.025 --> 12:37.427
AAH! OH! OH!
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

12:37.427 --> 12:39.359
TRAVIS!

12:39.359 --> 12:41.361
AAH!

12:48.238 --> 12:49.800
HOW MUCH FOR THESE?

12:49.800 --> 12:51.201
(people murmur indistinctly)

12:54.975 --> 12:56.877
THAT STUPID GO-KART CRASH
COST ME 600 BUCKS.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.779
ON THE PLUS SIDE,
WE ALL HAVE NEW SUNGLASSES.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.151
(all chuckle)

13:01.151 --> 13:04.384
DUDE! COULD YOU PLEASE
PUT SOMETHING ON?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.116
IT'S NAKED DAY, DAMN IT.

13:06.116 --> 13:07.357
YOU SHAVE YOUR BUTT?

13:07.357 --> 13:08.819
THAT'S MY BUSINESS.

13:08.819 --> 13:10.020
HE DOESN'T.
I DO IT FOR HIM.

13:10.020 --> 13:11.421
OKAY, GUYS,
WE NEED TO FOCUS.

13:11.421 --> 13:13.293
TRAV IS PROBABLY MAD
AT ALL OF US.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.525
J-BIRD, WOULD I BE
THROWING YOU UNDER THE BUS

13:15.525 --> 13:17.467
IF I CALLED TRAV AND SAID
THAT I WANTED TO

13:17.467 --> 13:19.799
TELL HIM UPFRONT,
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LET ME?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.001
YES.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.402
WELL, THEN I'M SORRY FOR

13:22.402 --> 13:23.834
THROWING YOU UNDER THE BUS
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.375
THAT'S SO UNFAIR.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.938
I CAN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE NOW
SINCE HE TOOK OFF AGAIN.

13:27.938 --> 13:29.379
AH, WHERE'D HE GO,
HAWAII?

13:29.379 --> 13:30.981
OKAY.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.182
I HAVE WARNED YOU.

13:32.182 --> 13:33.513
IF YOU SAY IT
LIKE THAT AGAIN,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.245
WE ARE SO FIGHTING.

13:35.245 --> 13:37.587
(beeps)
(Travis) MOM...

13:37.587 --> 13:39.449
(sighs) I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M OKAY,

13:39.449 --> 13:42.122
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO TALK.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.094
GONNA CAMPOUT
FOR A WHILE.

13:44.094 --> 13:46.456
JUST GONNA LIVE OFF
THE LAND.

13:46.456 --> 13:50.060
MAYBE GROW A BEARD
IF THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.063
DON'T LOOK FOR ME.

13:53.063 --> 13:54.865
OH, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

13:54.865 --> 13:56.967
I'M SUCH A BAD MOM.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.939
(beep)
THE WORST MOM!

13:58.939 --> 14:00.270
OKAY, I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR THAT TO BE OVER.

14:00.270 --> 14:01.942
SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE WANTS.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.513
(lowered voice) I DON'T THINK
I CAN MAKE HIM STOP.

14:03.513 --> 14:07.077
SHE DOUBTS HERSELF.
SHE'S ONLY HUMAN.

14:07.077 --> 14:08.949
I'LL GO.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.280
IF TRAV REALLY IS,
UH, CAMPING

14:10.280 --> 14:12.022
IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE
THE AMAZON,

14:12.022 --> 14:14.354
WHY IS HE HOLDING
A TV REMOTE?

14:16.026 --> 14:18.458
EMERGENCY MEETING. NOW.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.991
GREAT.

14:20.991 --> 14:23.293
(footsteps running)

14:23.293 --> 14:25.495
STAN?

14:25.495 --> 14:28.538
BUDDY, IS THAT YOU?

14:28.538 --> 14:30.640
(switch clicks)

14:30.640 --> 14:32.572
STAN?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.574
STAN? OH! OH!
OH, DON'T KILL ME!

14:34.574 --> 14:37.877
TAKE YOUR MOM!
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN SHE DOES!

14:37.877 --> 14:39.950
AAH! (grunts)

14:39.950 --> 14:41.982
(laughs)

14:41.982 --> 14:44.384
HUH.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.916
(exhales)

14:45.916 --> 14:47.887
(Ellie) OH.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.289
THERE IS NOTHING SADDER

14:49.289 --> 14:52.322
THAN A NAKED GUY
ALL ALONE ON NAKED DAY.

14:52.322 --> 14:55.165
I THOUGHT MY WIFE WOULD CARE
IF I WAS NUDE FOR HER.

14:55.165 --> 14:56.666
IF YOU EVER WRITE
A SUICIDE NOTE,

14:56.666 --> 14:58.468
THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD START.

14:58.468 --> 15:00.230
THE CLICHE'S TRUE.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.672
WHEN YOU FIRST FALL IN LOVE,
IT'S ALL HOT AND SEXY.

15:02.672 --> 15:05.075
AND THEN YOU GET MARRIED,
AND THEN IT'S ONCE A WEEK,

15:05.075 --> 15:07.237
LIGHTS OFF, SOCKS ON.

15:07.237 --> 15:08.608
JULES WEARS SOCKS?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.110
TWO PAIR.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.012
HER FEET AND HER HANDS
GET COLD.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.944
I AM STEALING THAT.

15:13.944 --> 15:15.285
LOOK, DIME EYES.

15:15.285 --> 15:17.187
WE'RE NOT YOUNG,
STUPID COUPLES

15:17.187 --> 15:18.989
THAT ARE NAKED ALL DAY

15:18.989 --> 15:22.092
OR TRYING TO GET HEP "C" BY
DOING IT IN PUBLIC BATHROOMS.

15:22.092 --> 15:24.054
UNTIL I STARTED
TORTURING YOU,

15:24.054 --> 15:26.596
WEREN'T YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR
ONE AND A HALF TIMES A WEEK?

15:26.596 --> 15:28.498
I GUESS.

15:28.498 --> 15:30.660
WELL, THEN STOP ACTING LIKE
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.232
THANKS.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.933
SURE. I'M SORRY.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.166
I CAN'T REALLY HAVE
A NICE MOMENT WITH YOU

15:36.166 --> 15:38.238
WHEN YOU HAVE IT
TUCKED BEHIND LIKE THAT.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.971
I WAS TRYING
TO BE RESPECTFUL.

15:40.971 --> 15:42.372
JUST PUT IT OUT.

15:44.975 --> 15:47.547
I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT HAPPY
TO SEE EITHER ONE OF US.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.120
NO, NO. IT'S... GREAT.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.721
I MEAN, MOST PEOPLE
DON'T GET A CHANCE

15:51.721 --> 15:55.155
TO ACTUALLY LIVE OUT
THEIR WORST NIGHTMARE.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.987
O-OKAY.

15:56.987 --> 15:59.329
WHO'S GONNA
GET THIS BALL ROLLING?

15:59.329 --> 16:03.163
SO, LAURIE...

16:03.163 --> 16:05.565
WHAT'S NEW?

16:05.565 --> 16:09.439
JUST THE WHOLE "ME MOVING IN
WITH WADE" THING.

16:09.439 --> 16:11.141
RIGHT.

16:11.141 --> 16:12.672
I'M REALLY SORRY, TRAVIS.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.575
I... I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.147
NO, IT'S COOL.

16:17.147 --> 16:19.249
I'M MOSTLY PISSED
AT HER.

16:19.249 --> 16:20.450
(cell phone rings)
(whispers) OKAY.

16:20.450 --> 16:21.981
YEAH.
(beeps)

16:21.981 --> 16:23.453
HEY, BABE, IT'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD TIME.

16:23.453 --> 16:26.386
OH, I DON'T CARE
WHAT WE HAVE FOR DINNER.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.687
(grunts)

16:27.687 --> 16:29.089
THROTTLE IT BACK, ANDO.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.760
AH, I CAN'T.
MY HEART IS RACING.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.993
(inhales deeply)
OH, I THINK I'M GONNA DIE.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.495
OH.
OKAY, I'M HERE FOR YOU,
BUDDY. ALL RIGHT?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.097
JUST LOOK INTO MY EYES.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.369
(exhales)
THEY'RE SO BLUE.

16:39.369 --> 16:42.102
THERE. ALL BETTER.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.374
WHY WOULD YOU MESS
WITH ME?

16:44.374 --> 16:46.776
MY WORLD DOESN'T WORK
IF YOU MESS WITH ME.

16:46.776 --> 16:49.679
EVERYONE JOKES ABOUT STAN
BEING A DEVIL BABY.

16:49.679 --> 16:51.381
BUT NOT YOU.

16:51.381 --> 16:53.113
YOU NEVER BOUGHT INTO IT,

16:53.113 --> 16:55.085
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU
SUCH A GREAT PERSON.

16:55.085 --> 16:57.587
YOU'RE THE GUY THAT ALWAYS
BELIEVES IN EVERYONE,

16:57.587 --> 16:59.689
EVEN ME. (chuckles)

16:59.689 --> 17:02.452
AND I USE AN OLD BATHROOM CANDLE
AS DEODORANT.

17:02.452 --> 17:05.395
SO FROM ONE FATHER
TO ANOTHER,

17:05.395 --> 17:09.199
YOU GOTTA ALWAYS
BELIEVE IN YOUR SON.

17:09.199 --> 17:11.061
(sighs deeply)

17:11.061 --> 17:12.562
I HEAR YOU.

17:12.562 --> 17:15.265
(toilet flushes)

17:15.265 --> 17:18.708
AAH!

17:18.708 --> 17:21.511
(laughs)

17:21.511 --> 17:23.273
THANKS FOR ALL THESE SHADES.

17:23.273 --> 17:25.775
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO THIS.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.448
YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE THING
WITH LAURIE--

17:28.448 --> 17:30.550
I-I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, RIGHT?

17:30.550 --> 17:33.123
I KNOW, MOM.

17:33.123 --> 17:36.186
WELL, YOUR DAD SAYS
I NEED TO STOP DOING THAT.

17:36.186 --> 17:38.288
HE THINKS I NEED TO LET YOU
FACE THE HARSH TRUTH

17:38.288 --> 17:40.160
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.661
HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

17:41.661 --> 17:45.265
I MEAN, SOMETIMES YOUR DAD
IS A BETTER PARENT THAN ME.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.237
NO, HE'S NOT.

17:47.237 --> 17:49.068
SORRY.
NO, HE'S NOT.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.501
NO, SOMETIMES HE IS,

17:51.501 --> 17:53.173
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IT'S--

17:53.173 --> 17:55.275
IT'S NOT HOW YOU DEAL
WITH THE GOOD TIMES

17:55.275 --> 17:56.846
THAT MAKES YOU
A STRONGER PERSON.

17:56.846 --> 17:59.649
IT'S HOW YOU
HANDLE DISAPPOINTMENT.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.652
FINE. HARSH TRUTH.

18:02.652 --> 18:05.155
DO LAURIE AND I HAVE A SHOT
AT ENDING UP TOGETHER?

18:05.155 --> 18:07.757
WELL, WE DON'T NEED TO START
HARSH-TRUTHIN' IT RIGHT AWAY.

18:07.757 --> 18:09.589
MOM, J-- (sighs)

18:09.589 --> 18:11.261
OKAY.

18:11.261 --> 18:12.692
NO.

18:12.692 --> 18:16.426
SHE SAID THAT SHE HAS
SOMETHING REAL WITH WADE NOW.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.828
I AM SORRY.

18:18.828 --> 18:21.201
NO, IT'S...

18:21.201 --> 18:23.273
IT'S GOOD.

18:23.273 --> 18:25.605
'CAUSE I CAN FINALLY JUST...

18:25.605 --> 18:27.307
LET IT GO.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.679

18:29.679 --> 18:32.342
I'M GLAD.

18:32.342 --> 18:33.813
HEY.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.515

18:35.515 --> 18:37.116

18:37.116 --> 18:39.719

FOR YOU AND WADE.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.451
I MEAN IT.

18:41.451 --> 18:43.293

FORWARD IN YOUR LIFE.

18:43.293 --> 18:45.425
AND... I SHOULD, TOO.

18:45.425 --> 18:49.359

18:56.406 --> 18:58.808

18:58.808 --> 19:01.471

19:05.615 --> 19:07.177

19:07.177 --> 19:09.919
IT SEEMS LIKE HE GOT OVER ME
REALLY FAST.

19:09.919 --> 19:11.321
BUT THAT'S GOOD.

19:11.321 --> 19:12.522

19:23.763 --> 19:25.495
IT'S NAKED DAY
FOR THREE MORE HOURS.

19:25.495 --> 19:26.936

WITH WHAT WE HAVE.

19:33.203 --> 19:34.804

19:34.804 --> 19:36.346
AND I DON'T WANT HEP "C."

19:36.346 --> 19:37.677

19:37.677 --> 19:39.249

19:39.249 --> 19:40.580
LOOK, THE POINT IS THAT

19:40.580 --> 19:41.951

19:41.951 --> 19:43.453
AND THAT HALF THING
YOU DO,

19:43.453 --> 19:44.814
THAT IS SPECIAL.

19:44.814 --> 19:46.786
SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE WOULD PAY

19:48.918 --> 19:50.320

19:50.320 --> 19:51.821

I MEAN, IF YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING,

19:53.363 --> 19:54.894
THEN I'M COOL WITH IT.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.197
