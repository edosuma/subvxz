Since no one has ever

never really existed.

a clever sleight of hand,

03:19.999 --> 03:21.762

I've never seen
Charles like this before.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.669
I'm afraid something
terrible is going to happen.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.837
Nothing's going to happen,
but you have to help me.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.403
Where is Charles headed?

35:17.482 --> 35:20.918
I heard him talk to Frobe
about meeting someone at sea.

35:21.385 --> 35:24.411
I'm scared! Do you know
what this is all about?

35:24.489 --> 35:26.252
Not yet,
but I intend to find out.

35:28.693 --> 35:30.024
Let go of the girl.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.602
So I was right,
my darling, after all.

35:38.669 --> 35:40.330
You have betrayed me.

35:41.038 --> 35:43.302
That will be your misfortune,

35:43.608 --> 35:47.476
unless Mr. Ross
would care to spare you
a great deal of pain

35:47.845 --> 35:51.406
by revealing all he knows
of Operation Undertow.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.744
Hmm?

35:54.552 --> 35:56.213
No, of course not.

35:56.654 --> 36:00.818
Death before dishonor
for the great Logan Ross.

36:01.058 --> 36:03.288
The sharks will
eat well today.

36:15.206 --> 36:17.436
JOURDAN:
Keep a very close eye
on Mr. Ross.

36:34.592 --> 36:36.389
Hey, Hannibal, check this out.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.796
Looks like Jourdan's
got company.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.509
Let me out of here!
I want to see Jourdan!
I'll talk.

37:00.151 --> 37:01.345
(GROANlNG)

37:05.323 --> 37:06.347
Oh, no.

37:08.759 --> 37:11.694
Frankie? Frankie?
Are you all right?

37:11.796 --> 37:13.263
Speak to me. Speak to me.

37:13.764 --> 37:14.924
(GROANlNG)

37:22.573 --> 37:26.236
Prince James' route has been
verified this morning,

37:26.310 --> 37:28.676
so your charts are accurate.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.212
Then we have a bargain.

37:30.948 --> 37:32.540
By 4:00 this afternoon,

37:32.617 --> 37:35.017
Prince James will be
but a memory.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.713
Monsieur Jourdan,
Ross has escaped!

37:36.787 --> 37:38.448
He knocked
one of the caterers down!

37:38.522 --> 37:39.955
That man is relentless.

37:42.293 --> 37:43.419
(GROANlNG)

37:45.863 --> 37:47.296
(FlRlNG)

37:47.365 --> 37:48.730
That's our cue.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.637
Prepare the launch!

38:26.237 --> 38:27.261
(GRUNTlNG)

38:28.139 --> 38:29.470
(EXCLAlMlNG)

38:44.488 --> 38:46.422
Goodbye, Mr. Ross.

38:47.525 --> 38:48.787
(GUN FlRlNG)

38:51.896 --> 38:52.988
(EXCLAlMlNG)

39:16.954 --> 39:20.185
Now, there's an international
warrant out for Frobe,
but he's still loose.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.851
So be careful, Dominique.
Of course.

39:23.394 --> 39:25.259
I don't know
how I'll ever thank you.

39:25.796 --> 39:28.993
You wouldn't happen
to have a sister, would you?

39:31.569 --> 39:34.538
I can't bear to think of you
in the arms of another woman.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.165
Must you go so soon?
Well,

39:38.743 --> 39:41.803
I'm afraid my government
wouldn't have it
any other way.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.503
Frobe, The Jaguar.
I didn't see that coming!

40:46.644 --> 40:48.168
Always the quiet ones.

40:48.245 --> 40:51.908
It's too bad it took us
so long to find out that
Jourdan was really paralyzed.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.412
We'll pick him up,

40:54.785 --> 40:56.980
deliver him to Stockwell,
and then go home.

40:58.155 --> 40:59.588
Go get him, B.A.

40:59.824 --> 41:02.657
HANNlBAL ON RADlO:
Frobe bought
the remote limo gag just fine.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.091
Got him, Hannibal.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.133
Frobe's in the office
behind the registration desk.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.301
Let's go.

41:20.277 --> 41:23.007
Wait, wait.
You can't come in here!
What is...

41:23.113 --> 41:25.047
Stop! You can't go in there!
Wait!

41:42.266 --> 41:44.291
Did you take care of them,
Frobe?

41:45.169 --> 41:46.864
Excellent job as usual.

41:55.679 --> 41:59.240
Dominique? I really didn't
see that coming!

41:59.850 --> 42:01.545
It's always the sexy ones.

42:01.619 --> 42:03.985
Come on, we got to get
to the Prince before she does.

42:06.924 --> 42:08.858
WOMAN ON RADlO: Attention,
Boston Whaler.

42:08.926 --> 42:11.986
Please stay calm.
We're pulling along the side.

42:23.607 --> 42:25.541
Yes, miss. What seems
to be the trouble?

42:25.609 --> 42:27.099
My engine failed.

42:27.177 --> 42:28.974
And what with the sharks
in these waters,

42:29.046 --> 42:30.843
thank goodness
my radio was operative.

42:30.915 --> 42:33.941
Oh, you're lucky.
The Prince's yacht is
the only vessel in the area.

42:34.018 --> 42:37.454
The Prince? I saw the flag,
but I never realized.

42:37.621 --> 42:39.248
Is the Prince really on board?

42:39.623 --> 42:41.090
Taking his royal nap.

42:41.158 --> 42:42.750
Take the young lady
to her cabin.

42:43.193 --> 42:45.957
You may sail back
with us if you like, miss.
Thank you.

42:53.938 --> 42:55.166
If you need anything,
just call.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.570
Merci. I will.

43:43.787 --> 43:46.119
Sweet dreams, my Prince.

43:46.357 --> 43:47.790
(BALLOON HlSSlNG)

43:56.567 --> 44:00.230
Don't take it too badly.
The old Prince-balloon trick
never fails.

44:02.072 --> 44:03.903
Sorry to spoil your fun,
my dear.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.877
What were you going to do,
Dominique?

44:09.179 --> 44:10.771
Kill everybody on board?

44:11.148 --> 44:13.173
That sounds kind of chancy.

44:13.550 --> 44:15.518
I never take chances.

44:20.624 --> 44:21.852
B.A.!

44:24.762 --> 44:25.751
(GRUNTlNG)

44:41.812 --> 44:44.975
Captain, did she bring
any luggage on board?

44:45.215 --> 44:46.910
A small case.
I'll get it.

45:04.501 --> 45:06.560
ENSlGN: It's a bomb.
CAPTAlN: 10 seconds.

45:07.805 --> 45:08.863
It's almost ready.

45:08.939 --> 45:10.065
They're getting away!

45:10.441 --> 45:11.567
They'll be back.

45:43.273 --> 45:45.241
CAPTAlN: Someone throw over
lifelines at them.

46:14.671 --> 46:16.764
I just received a signal
from Prince James.

46:17.674 --> 46:20.040
Well, I hope
you gave him my regards.

46:20.277 --> 46:21.437
CAPTAlN: Most definitely.

46:21.512 --> 46:23.946
As a matter of fact,
the Prince requests
that you gentlemen

46:24.014 --> 46:26.175
stay aboard as his guests
for as long as you wish.

46:26.250 --> 46:27.547
Tell him we accept.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.178
The Prince also asked
that I deliver
a special message

46:30.254 --> 46:33.246
to your Mr. Murdock.
Where might he be?

46:37.427 --> 46:39.827
This is wonderful champagne,
Logan.

46:40.164 --> 46:42.792
This is Dom Perignon '71,
if I recall.

46:43.433 --> 46:45.663
Are there any other surprises
I should know about?

46:46.270 --> 46:47.396
Just one.

46:50.340 --> 46:51.671
(CLEARlNG THROAT)

46:51.875 --> 46:54.070
Won't your friends be
wondering where you are?

46:54.511 --> 46:56.035
You might be right.
