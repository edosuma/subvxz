00:24.624 --> 00:26.759
<i>Every town has its legends.</i>

00:26.761 --> 00:30.596
<i>Every neighborhood</i>
<i>has its boogeymen...</i>

00:30.598 --> 00:34.099
<i>A killer with a hook</i>
<i>for a hand...</i>

00:34.101 --> 00:37.336
<i>A drifter</i>
<i>who snatches children...</i>

00:37.338 --> 00:40.372
<i>The witch who lives</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

00:40.374 --> 00:43.475
<i>Ours growing up in</i>
<i>staten island was cropsey,</i>

00:43.477 --> 00:47.079
<i>about an escaped mental patient</i>
<i>who lived in these buildings</i>

00:47.081 --> 00:49.148
<i>who would snatch children</i>
<i>off the street.</i>

00:51.751 --> 00:53.652
<i>This urban legend turned real</i>

00:53.654 --> 00:56.789
<i>when five neighborhood children</i>
<i>went missing.</i>

00:59.459 --> 01:02.227
<i>It was these disappearances</i>
<i>that led us to examine</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:05.230
<i>the real crimes behind</i>
<i>the cropsey urban legend.</i>

01:05.232 --> 01:05.230
<i>A grisly discovery</i>

01:05.232 --> 01:09.268
<i>of an arm and a leg</i>
<i>sticking out</i>
<i>from a shallow grave.</i>

01:09.270 --> 01:10.702
<i> And what we</i>
<i>discovered was a connection</i>

01:10.704 --> 01:13.739
<i>to an institution</i>
<i>with a shocking history.</i>

01:13.741 --> 01:15.307
<i>This is what it looked like,</i>

01:15.309 --> 01:18.110
<i>but how can I tell you</i>
<i>about the way it smelled.</i>

01:18.112 --> 01:20.579
<i>It smelled of filth,</i>
<i>it smelled of disease,</i>

01:20.581 --> 01:21.847
<i>and it smelled of death.</i>

01:21.849 --> 01:24.416
<i> Understanding</i>
<i>the real story behind cropsey</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:27.486
<i>inspired us to investigate</i>
<i>other urban legends</i>

01:27.488 --> 01:30.789
<i>and the true crimes</i>
<i>that may have influenced them,</i>

01:30.791 --> 01:30.789
<i>and what we uncovered</i>

01:30.791 --> 01:35.461
<i>was a truth more horrific</i>
<i>than any fiction.</i>

02:34.921 --> 02:37.623
This is where
we thought that cropsey lived,

02:37.625 --> 02:40.626
in these buildings here.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.728
It's very easy
for an urban legend

02:42.730 --> 02:44.496
to come out of
something like this.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.598
Yeah, and we didn't
think anything of it

02:46.600 --> 02:49.902
until kids started going missing
on staten island,

02:49.904 --> 02:53.672
and then we were like,
cropsey is real.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.274
But do you think
every urban legend

02:55.276 --> 02:55.274
has truth behind it?

02:55.276 --> 02:59.244
Yes, I think you have to have
some form of like truth

02:59.246 --> 03:00.879
to gonna go off of.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.447
There's a lot of
other urban legends

03:02.449 --> 03:03.615
in a lot of other communities

03:03.617 --> 03:05.417
that have some form of truth
behind them.

03:05.419 --> 03:05.417
Uh-hm.

03:05.419 --> 03:08.353
And what's interesting
is all these communities

03:08.355 --> 03:10.455
have all these places.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.291
<i>Well, every kid is lured to</i>

03:12.293 --> 03:17.496
<i>or fascinated by the old house</i>
<i>at the end of the block.</i>

03:17.498 --> 03:19.231
These are the stories
that fuel your nightmares,

03:19.233 --> 03:21.967
and these are the places
that fuel your nightmares.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.535
<i>So why are you here tonight?</i>

03:23.537 --> 03:23.535
You hear stories.

03:23.537 --> 03:23.535
We just want to see
what it's about, I guess.

03:23.537 --> 03:23.535
<i> What do you guys</i>
<i>expect to find out here?</i>

03:23.537 --> 03:29.641
People who died here
are supposed to be the ghosts.

03:29.643 --> 03:29.641
<i> You believe</i>
<i>that there are devil worshipers</i>

03:29.643 --> 03:32.377
<i>in the woods here?</i>
- Oh yeah, I do, I do.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.879
Somebody said they were doing
freaky experiments

03:33.881 --> 03:36.415
and crap like that.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.284
<i> Why do we believe</i>
<i>these urban legends?</i>

03:39.286 --> 03:40.919
<i>Maybe we need to believe</i>

03:40.921 --> 03:45.457
<i>because the reality is too much</i>
<i>for some of us to bear.</i>

03:45.459 --> 03:47.659
<i>An old legend that actually</i>
<i>happened this time...</i>

03:47.661 --> 03:49.895
<i>- Many more cases</i>
<i>of contaminated treats...</i>

03:49.897 --> 03:51.863
<i>I know she suffered, a lot.</i>

03:51.865 --> 03:53.332
<i>He pulled a knife</i>

03:53.334 --> 03:55.634
<i>and tied me up</i>
<i>with electrical tape.</i>

03:55.636 --> 03:55.634
Oh, God.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.304
<i> And so instead,</i>
<i>we created our own monsters.</i>

03:59.306 --> 04:00.806
<i> The</i>
<i>36-year-old building contractor</i>

04:00.808 --> 04:02.608
<i>who reportedly dressed</i>
<i>like a clown...</i>

04:02.610 --> 04:04.009
<i>At least three young boys</i>

04:04.011 --> 04:05.711
<i>buried under his house.</i>

04:05.713 --> 04:05.711
<i>And maybe that's because</i>

04:05.713 --> 04:10.649
the truth is more terrifying
than we could ever imagine.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.417
<i>- I got seven down</i>
<i>and.</i>

04:12.419 --> 04:13.419
<i>Seven down!</i>

04:13.420 --> 04:16.988
<i>I've got a child victim...</i>
<i>I need rescue.</i>

04:18.324 --> 04:20.325
<i> For Rachel and me,</i>
<i>this is an attempt</i>

04:20.327 --> 04:23.662
<i>to uncover the source</i>
<i>of our nightmares</i>

04:23.664 --> 04:27.466
<i>as we pull back the curtains</i>
<i>on what it is we all fear...</i>

04:27.468 --> 04:30.969
<i>because urban legends,</i>
<i>as scary as they may be,</i>

04:30.971 --> 04:35.007
<i>are really just warnings for</i>
<i>something much more dangerous...</i>

04:35.009 --> 04:38.443
<i>the reality that may have</i>
<i>started it all.</i>

04:46.419 --> 04:47.452
<i>The hook is one of the oldest</i>

04:47.454 --> 04:50.522
<i>and also one of the scariest</i>
<i>urban legends.</i>

04:50.524 --> 04:52.791
<i>A teenage couple</i>
<i>are making out in their car</i>

04:52.793 --> 04:54.793
<i>while parked at a lover's Lane.</i>

04:54.795 --> 04:56.762
<i>As the two are</i>
<i>about to go all the way,</i>

04:56.764 --> 04:58.330
<i>the radio interrupts them.</i>

04:58.332 --> 04:58.330
...Are killed by an LA gunman...

04:58.332 --> 04:58.330
<i> A crazed maniac</i>
<i>with a hook for a hand</i>

04:58.332 --> 05:03.635
<i>has escaped</i>
<i>from the local insane asylum.</i>

05:03.637 --> 05:05.337
<i>The frightened girl</i>
<i>demands to go home</i>

05:05.339 --> 05:08.573
<i>as the frustrated boy</i>
<i>guns the engine.</i>

05:08.575 --> 05:11.643
<i>Later, as the boyfriend</i>
<i>goes to open his date's door,</i>

05:11.645 --> 05:13.712
<i>he sees dangling</i>
<i>from the door handle,</i>

05:13.714 --> 05:18.350
<i>the maniac's bloody hook,</i>
<i>ripped from the socket.</i>

05:18.352 --> 05:19.551
The hook urban legend

05:19.553 --> 05:24.089
probably came to be
in the mid-1950s.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.758
<i>One of the interesting</i>
<i>appearances of the hook</i>

05:26.760 --> 05:28.760
<i>was in November 1960</i>

05:28.762 --> 05:31.063
<i>when it actually appeared</i>
<i>in the dear Abby column,</i>

05:31.065 --> 05:34.032
<i>and it's something that a</i>
<i>lot of people would have read.</i>

05:35.535 --> 05:37.102
<i> But dear Abby</i>
<i>wasn't warning teenagers</i>

05:37.104 --> 05:39.905
<i>about escaped madmen</i>
<i>with hooks for hands.</i>

05:40.440 --> 05:42.674
<i>Urban legends</i>
<i>are more mysterious than that</i>

05:42.676 --> 05:44.543
<i>and never quite so literal.</i>

05:44.977 --> 05:47.846
<i>Despite its name,</i>
<i>the hook is a cautionary tale</i>

05:47.848 --> 05:54.553
<i>warning teenagers everywhere</i>
<i>about the dangers of sex.</i>

05:54.555 --> 05:56.421
<i> The hook</i>
<i>urban legend captured something</i>

05:56.423 --> 05:59.091
in the era that people
were interested in.

05:59.093 --> 06:01.927
<i>It captured a certain amount</i>
<i>of danger being involved</i>

06:01.929 --> 06:07.699
<i>in teenage sexual behavior</i>
<i>and in teenage car culture.</i>

06:07.701 --> 06:10.001
<i> For the teenagers</i>
<i>in texarkana, Texas,</i>

06:10.003 --> 06:12.838
<i>this wasn't just</i>
<i>some cautionary tale.</i>

06:12.840 --> 06:15.107
<i>In the early spring of 1946,</i>

06:15.109 --> 06:17.075
<i>a masked man</i>
<i>known as the phantom</i>

06:17.077 --> 06:18.510
<i>attacked four couples,</i>

06:18.512 --> 06:21.012
<i>most of whom were parked</i>
<i>on lover's lanes.</i>

06:21.014 --> 06:22.514
<i>The attacks, which killed five,</i>

06:22.516 --> 06:24.649
<i>were said to coincide with</i>
<i>the full moon,</i>

06:24.651 --> 06:27.085
<i>hence the nickname</i>
<i>the moonlight murders.</i>

06:27.087 --> 06:28.653
<i>And although there were</i>
<i>numerous suspects,</i>

06:28.655 --> 06:30.989
<i>the phantom was never caught,</i>

06:30.991 --> 06:34.526
<i>allowing his enduring legacy</i>
<i>to haunt this town</i>

06:34.528 --> 06:36.795
<i>for more than six decades.</i>

06:40.833 --> 06:46.471
So this is South robeson
and this old highway 67.

06:46.473 --> 06:49.174
The murder site
is somewhere around here,

06:49.176 --> 06:51.943
but that's what we've got to
kind of figure out.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.413
<i> It was a rainy</i>
<i>Sunday morning on march 24</i>

06:54.415 --> 06:57.416
<i>when a passing motorist noticed</i>
<i>Richard Griffin's oldsmobile</i>

06:57.418 --> 07:01.186
<i>parked on a lover's Lane</i>
<i>off highway 67.</i>

07:01.188 --> 07:03.755
<i>Inside he found Griffin, age 29,</i>

07:03.757 --> 07:07.692
<i>and Polly Ann Moore, 17,</i>
<i>lying in the backseat.</i>

07:07.694 --> 07:11.930
<i>Both had been shot</i>
<i>in the back of the head.</i>

07:11.932 --> 07:13.465
<i> Hey, guys,</i>
<i>how are you doing?</i>

07:13.467 --> 07:13.465
<i>What we're doing is</i>

07:13.467 --> 07:16.601
<i>we're investigating</i>
<i>the phantom killer.</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:19.504
They had a lot of speculations
on who did it,

07:19.506 --> 07:21.440
but it was never...

07:21.442 --> 07:23.041
no one was ever
brought to justice.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.810
Did you hear stories growing up?

07:24.812 --> 07:27.446
All I ever heard was
don't go to spring lake park.

07:27.448 --> 07:27.446
Really?
Uh-hm.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.949
Why?
It's kind of
creepy out there,

07:30.951 --> 07:33.118
so we were always afraid
to go there.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.453
<i>But did you still go?</i>

07:34.455 --> 07:34.453
No.

07:34.455 --> 07:34.453
<i>We're having a little trouble</i>

07:34.455 --> 07:34.453
<i>finding out where the area is</i>
<i>because everything's changed.</i>

07:34.455 --> 07:40.559
Well, I can take you
out there to the road

07:40.561 --> 07:43.528
and point to almost the spot.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.696
Right about there.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.698
Uh-huh.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.998
<i>On that side?</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:48.834
On that side.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.535
<i> Like the couple</i>
<i>in the urban legend,</i>

07:50.537 --> 07:51.803
<i>Griffin and Moore</i>
<i>had been attacked</i>

07:51.805 --> 07:53.572
<i>while parked on lover's Lane,</i>

07:53.574 --> 07:56.675
<i>highlighting the warning</i>
<i>behind this campfire tale,</i>

07:56.677 --> 07:58.977
<i>but what the residents</i>
<i>in texarkana didn't know...</i>

07:58.979 --> 08:01.513
<i>because it wasn't reported</i>
<i>in the papers...</i>

08:01.515 --> 08:05.750
<i>were the horrific details</i>
<i>behind this real-life crime.</i>

08:05.752 --> 08:09.688
They had found evidence
of blood and a blanket...

08:09.690 --> 08:10.690
Uh-hm.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.857
And they believe
that she was raped

08:11.859 --> 08:13.258
out in front of the car

08:13.260 --> 08:17.028
and then put back in the car.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.230
<i>The first double murder</i>

08:18.232 --> 08:20.065
<i>didn't cause</i>
<i>a lot of excitement.</i>

08:20.067 --> 08:22.534
All kinds of crimes
were going on in texarkana,

08:22.536 --> 08:26.538
but they didn't recognize
until sometime later

08:26.540 --> 08:29.074
that this is a different
kind of crime.

08:29.076 --> 08:32.811
The term "serial killer"
wasn't in vogue then...

08:32.813 --> 08:36.014
And no one recognized
this as a serial killing.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.616
<i>The main suspect</i>
<i>was youell swinney</i>

08:38.619 --> 08:40.852
who was an ex-convict.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.888
<i> Youell swinney</i>
<i>and his newlywed bride,</i>

08:42.890 --> 08:44.756
<i>a former prostitute named Peggy,</i>

08:44.758 --> 08:47.726
<i>had been arrested</i>
<i>for stealing cars.</i>

08:47.728 --> 08:49.094
<i>Under questioning,</i>
<i>the wife confessed</i>

08:49.096 --> 08:51.062
<i>that her husband</i>
<i>was the phantom,</i>

08:51.064 --> 08:53.498
<i>but refused to sign a statement.</i>

08:53.500 --> 08:55.100
<i>Although the case</i>
<i>quickly fell apart,</i>

08:55.102 --> 08:58.003
<i>the judge still sent swinney</i>
<i>away for life</i>

08:58.005 --> 09:00.839
<i>as a habitual car thief.</i>

09:00.841 --> 09:02.908
No evidence directly
correlating...

09:02.910 --> 09:05.076
<i>No physical evidence.</i>

09:05.078 --> 09:07.279
They had his wife's statement,

09:07.281 --> 09:09.981
but they could not use that
without her permission.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.617
There had been a lot of
other suspects, hundreds.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.985
People had theories

09:13.987 --> 09:16.755
and all kinds of rumors
had been bouncing around,

09:16.757 --> 09:20.659
but it's normal in any event,
especially when there's mystery

09:20.661 --> 09:23.795
as there was always mystery
in this one.

09:23.797 --> 09:27.599
<i>Texarkana is nothing</i>
<i>like other towns.</i>

09:27.601 --> 09:31.136
It seems to be wallowing
in the notoriety.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.104
Documentary team in town

09:33.106 --> 09:35.240
to shoot a part
of texarkana history.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.108
This week,
some texarkana residents

09:37.110 --> 09:38.977
will have the chance
to appear onscreen

09:38.979 --> 09:41.580
<i>in a documentary film</i>
<i>of the phantom killer.</i>

09:41.582 --> 09:43.281
So what should we make
of all this?

09:43.283 --> 09:45.116
The conclusion is simple...

09:45.118 --> 09:47.319
texarkana will never
escape its past.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.087
We should give up trying.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.096
<i> It was a half moon</i>
<i>on February 22</i>

09:58.098 --> 10:00.131
<i>when Jimmy Hollis, age 24,</i>

10:00.133 --> 10:02.200
<i>and Mary Jeanne larey, 19,</i>

10:02.202 --> 10:05.103
<i>were attacked</i>
<i>on a secluded</i>
<i>lover's Lane.</i>

10:05.105 --> 10:08.974
<i>Both survived after a car</i>
<i>scared the assailant away.</i>

10:11.877 --> 10:13.078
<i>Around midnight,</i>

10:13.080 --> 10:14.980
<i>Mary Jeanne larey</i>
<i>and Jimmy Hollis</i>

10:14.982 --> 10:16.948
<i>were making out</i>
<i>in the front seat of their car.</i>

10:16.950 --> 10:20.151
All of a sudden,
a guy appears with a gun,

10:20.153 --> 10:22.621
wearing a mask over his head,
white,

10:22.623 --> 10:25.357
two holes cut out
for eyes and mouth.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.058
He tells her to run.

10:27.060 --> 10:31.730
He chases her down
and then starts to attack her,

10:31.732 --> 10:34.666
basically sexually assaults her
with the barrel of his gun.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.168
She said she'd much rather
have been killed like the others

10:37.170 --> 10:40.138
than to have been left
the way she was.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.875
<i> While the attacks</i>
<i>on lover's lanes in texarkana</i>

10:43.877 --> 10:46.111
<i>didn't specifically</i>
<i>involve a hook,</i>

10:46.113 --> 10:48.013
<i>the phantom's sickening crimes</i>

10:48.015 --> 10:52.183
<i>created an equally horrifying</i>
<i>metaphor.</i>

10:52.185 --> 10:54.419
<i> One of the victims</i>
<i>was actually sexually assaulted</i>

10:54.421 --> 10:56.154
<i>with the barrel of a gun,</i>

10:56.156 --> 10:59.724
and so we have the idea
of a foreign metal object

10:59.726 --> 11:01.926
being used in this way
which seems to be

11:01.928 --> 11:04.963
psychologically
behind the idea of the hook.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.732
<i>In the hook story,</i>
<i>we have the hook</i>

11:07.734 --> 11:11.302
<i>about to penetrate the car</i>
<i>when the boy drives away</i>

11:11.304 --> 11:14.139
<i>and the hook is then ripped</i>
<i>from the hand of the murderer.</i>

11:14.141 --> 11:16.941
<i>So we have the idea</i>
<i>of penetration</i>

11:16.943 --> 11:20.111
with a foreign metal object
as already part of that story,

11:20.113 --> 11:24.416
and that in fact happened
in the texarkana cases.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.818
<i> But the sexual assault</i>
<i>was only part</i>

11:26.820 --> 11:29.854
<i>of the phantom's</i>
<i>trademark signature.</i>

11:29.856 --> 11:30.989
These two people
are the only ones

11:30.991 --> 11:34.159
who ever saw the phantom.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.527
Both... wearing masks.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.296
<i> Right, they both said</i>
<i>the guy was wearing a mask.</i>

11:38.298 --> 11:38.296
So this is the whole thing,

11:38.298 --> 11:41.933
where the whole white
mask thing came from.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.004
<i>The phantom's disguise</i>
<i>was another chilling detail</i>

11:46.006 --> 11:47.305
<i>as it also helped to popularize</i>

11:47.307 --> 11:49.974
<i>the most widely known</i>
<i>retelling of the murders</i>

11:49.976 --> 11:55.413
<i>in the 1976 cult classic,</i>
"the town that dreaded sundown."

11:55.415 --> 11:57.982
<i>The movie was thought to be</i>
<i>one of the first slasher films,</i>

11:57.984 --> 12:00.418
<i>having predated Halloween</i>
<i>by two years,</i>

12:00.420 --> 12:02.120
<i>and its take on the phantom</i>

12:02.122 --> 12:06.424
<i>would influence generations</i>
<i>of cinematic boogeymen.</i>

12:06.426 --> 12:08.426
<i>The director,</i>
<i>Charles b. Pierce,</i>

12:08.428 --> 12:10.862
<i>blurred the lines</i>
<i>between fact and fiction</i>

12:10.864 --> 12:14.733
<i>by telling the film</i>
<i>in full documentary style.</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:19.070
<i>It was Sunday, march 3, 1946...</i>

12:19.072 --> 12:20.872
<i>the beginning of</i>
<i>a reign of terror</i>

12:20.874 --> 12:25.110
<i>for the people of texarkana,</i>
<i>a terror so indelibly imprinted</i>

12:25.112 --> 12:29.380
<i>that today, people</i>
<i>still speak of it fearfully...</i>

12:29.382 --> 12:33.084
<i>only the names</i>
<i>have been changed.</i>

12:35.387 --> 12:37.055
<i> Now I think</i>
<i>everybody in texarkana</i>

12:37.057 --> 12:39.357
<i>knows about the story</i>
<i>of the phantom killer,</i>

12:39.359 --> 12:41.059
<i>but there's a lot of</i>
<i>intermingling</i>

12:41.061 --> 12:44.162
<i>of facts and legend</i>
<i>between the movie</i>

12:44.164 --> 12:46.765
<i>and the actual</i>
<i>phantom killer case.</i>

12:46.767 --> 12:48.199
<i>This is Casey Roberts,</i>

12:48.201 --> 12:51.202
<i>media manager</i>
<i>at Texas a&m, texarkana.</i>

12:51.204 --> 12:53.238
<i>He's done extensive research</i>
<i>on the crimes</i>

12:53.240 --> 12:55.507
<i>and brought us</i>
<i>to one of the locations where</i>

12:55.509 --> 12:57.909
"the town that dreaded sundown"
<i>was filmed.</i>

12:57.911 --> 12:59.778
A lot the... kind of landmarks

12:59.780 --> 13:02.247
from both the original case
of the phantom killer

13:02.249 --> 13:03.982
and the movie
<i>the town that dreaded sundown</i>

13:03.984 --> 13:05.316
have gone away over the years,

13:05.318 --> 13:06.885
and this particular house here

13:06.887 --> 13:10.221
<i>was used in one of</i>
<i>the big scenes.</i>

13:10.223 --> 13:10.221
<i>It was Friday, may 3,</i>

13:10.223 --> 13:14.559
<i>when Virgil and Katie starks</i>
<i>were attacked in</i>
<i>their farmhouse</i>

13:14.561 --> 13:16.795
<i>just outside of town.</i>

13:17.963 --> 13:20.131
<i>Virgil was shot</i>
<i>and killed in his armchair...</i>

13:22.402 --> 13:25.170
<i>While Katie, shot in the face,</i>

13:25.172 --> 13:26.905
<i>ran out of the house.</i>

13:28.774 --> 13:31.109
<i>Everybody seems convinced</i>
<i>that youell swinney is the guy,</i>

13:31.111 --> 13:32.811
but you're saying...

13:32.813 --> 13:35.446
Youell swinney would have
been easy to pin it on,

13:35.448 --> 13:37.849
<i>and they needed to</i>
<i>pin it on somebody.</i>

13:37.851 --> 13:39.551
The one person that...

13:39.553 --> 13:42.554
I haven't been satisfied
he was cleared...

13:42.556 --> 13:44.856
<i>was a young man</i>
<i>that committed suicide</i>

13:44.858 --> 13:48.293
<i>and left a note saying</i>
<i>that he was the phantom killer.</i>

13:48.295 --> 13:51.329
<i>It's just part of the legend...</i>
<i>the son of a prominent family,</i>

13:51.331 --> 13:53.832
and it had the connections to,
you know,

13:53.834 --> 13:56.367
cover up his dirty deed.

13:57.536 --> 13:59.370
<i> Hoping to dig up</i>
<i>more information,</i>

13:59.372 --> 14:01.472
<i>we went searching</i>
<i>through the microfiche</i>

14:01.474 --> 14:03.474
<i>of the texarkana gazette.</i>

14:05.010 --> 14:06.444
<i>Promising lead proves dud.</i>

14:06.446 --> 14:09.214
So this is the mention
of that, youell swinney.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.949
The officer had been
trying to validate

14:10.951 --> 14:12.317
the story of a woman.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.185
<i>The woman's statement</i>
<i>followed so closely</i>

14:14.187 --> 14:14.185
<i>to the known facts of the case</i>

14:14.187 --> 14:18.156
<i>that they are almost positive</i>
<i>that she was telling the truth,</i>

14:18.158 --> 14:20.024
and at one point,
they were almost to the point

14:20.026 --> 14:21.826
of announcing a break
in the case.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.428
Subsequently, however,
the woman said

14:23.430 --> 14:25.096
<i>that neither she nor her husband</i>

14:25.098 --> 14:30.134
had anything to do
with the slayings.

14:30.136 --> 14:30.134
<i>It's interesting.</i>

14:30.136 --> 14:33.171
So they don't call him
the phantom at all in this,

14:33.173 --> 14:38.009
but we just saw, literally,

14:38.011 --> 14:40.011
the advertisement
in the newspaper

14:40.013 --> 14:43.147
for the movie that is showing,
<i>the phantom speaks.</i>

14:43.149 --> 14:46.050
This is the movie
that they theoretically

14:46.052 --> 14:47.452
pulled the name from,

14:47.454 --> 14:49.454
<i>and right here at the newspaper,</i>

14:49.456 --> 14:49.454
<i>one of the guys said,</i>

14:49.456 --> 14:49.454
'well, why don't we call him
something...'

14:49.456 --> 14:54.893
we need to call him something,
let's call him the phantom.

14:56.128 --> 14:58.229
<i>We had just witnessed</i>
<i>an important step</i>

14:58.231 --> 15:00.365
<i>in the creation</i>
<i>of any urban legend...</i>

15:00.367 --> 15:02.667
<i>the naming of the boogeyman.</i>

15:04.036 --> 15:06.471
<i> One of the roles</i>
<i>that urban legends play...</i>

15:06.473 --> 15:08.940
<i>and this is</i>
<i>an ancient function...</i>

15:08.942 --> 15:12.176
is that they will put
a name on something

15:12.178 --> 15:15.880
that gives people
fears or anxieties.

15:15.882 --> 15:21.052
<i>That gives the person</i>
<i>some feeling of control.</i>

15:21.054 --> 15:25.323
So give the murderer a name...
he's the phantom murderer.

15:25.325 --> 15:29.294
<i> The mask,</i>
<i>the movie, the phantom.</i>

15:29.296 --> 15:31.529
<i>These were the crucial elements</i>
<i>that would help create</i>

15:31.531 --> 15:34.599
<i>texarkana's very own</i>
<i>urban legend...</i>

15:34.601 --> 15:37.035
<i>a legend that would only</i>
<i>continue to grow</i>

15:37.037 --> 15:39.470
<i>with screenings of</i>
"the town that dreaded sundown"

15:39.472 --> 15:43.641
<i>held every year in</i>
<i>texarkana's spring lake park.</i>

15:43.643 --> 15:46.611
All of this area was part
of spring lake park...

15:46.613 --> 15:48.212
At the time and this is where...

15:48.214 --> 15:50.381
a couple of the places
where the murders happened.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.284
<i>That was where lover's Lane was.</i>

15:53.286 --> 15:55.453
You basically
set up the screening

15:55.455 --> 15:58.556
that you have of
<i>the town that dreaded sundown</i>

15:58.558 --> 16:01.092
at spring lake park.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.962
Yes, we do it every October,
and because of the history,

16:03.964 --> 16:07.498
we like the idea of having this
out at spring lake park

16:07.500 --> 16:10.268
since that's where some of
the murders take place at.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.669
We started getting
some phone calls saying

16:11.671 --> 16:13.338
that they didn't think
it was right,

16:13.340 --> 16:15.573
that there were
still families in town...

16:15.575 --> 16:19.377
That, you know,
that were affected by this.

16:19.379 --> 16:19.377
<i>The police concern was</i>

16:19.379 --> 16:23.047
that it was going to
cause somebody else

16:23.049 --> 16:26.217
to have the idea
to start doing it again.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.519
A film crew was in town
last month...

16:28.521 --> 16:30.588
And there's a new movie
being made?

16:30.590 --> 16:33.291
What we've heard is
that it was actually a remake

16:33.293 --> 16:33.291
of <i> 'the town</i>
<i>that dreaded sundowns</i> .'

16:33.293 --> 16:40.031
it's you know, just probably
a more modern version of it.

16:40.033 --> 16:43.167
I've heard that the storyline
of the movie

16:43.169 --> 16:46.971
is about a copycat
that comes out

16:46.973 --> 16:52.076
from the screenings
that happened at spring lake.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.146
Are you serious?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.615
That's the first
I've heard about that.

16:57.617 --> 17:01.753
Well, you know,
imitation of life, I guess.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.088
<i> While it may seem</i>
<i>shocking to some,</i>

17:04.089 --> 17:06.124
<i>the screenings</i>
<i>at spring lake park</i>

17:06.126 --> 17:09.426
<i>were especially appropriate</i>
<i>because it was here on April 14</i>

17:09.429 --> 17:13.731
<i>where the phantom</i>
<i>turned larger than life.</i>

17:13.733 --> 17:13.731
Four hundred yards

17:13.733 --> 17:16.233
from the entrance
to spring lake park...

17:16.236 --> 17:16.233
where the sign is...

17:16.236 --> 17:20.405
they found
Paul Martin's car empty.

17:20.406 --> 17:20.405
<i>In yet another attack,</i>

17:20.406 --> 17:24.008
<i>not only had the phantom</i>
<i>murdered two teenagers</i>

17:24.010 --> 17:25.576
<i>in the center of town,</i>

17:25.578 --> 17:27.478
<i>but their deaths</i>
<i>would incite a panic</i>

17:27.480 --> 17:31.482
<i>that would grip texarkana</i>
<i>and never let go.</i>

17:31.484 --> 17:33.451
<i>Betty Jo booker, age 15,</i>

17:33.453 --> 17:35.453
<i>was a saxophonist</i>
<i>for a high school band</i>

17:35.455 --> 17:37.121
<i>called the rhythmaires</i>

17:37.123 --> 17:40.591
<i>that played weekend shows</i>
<i>at the local vfw.</i>

17:40.593 --> 17:43.094
<i>At 1:30 A.M.</i>
<i>that Saturday night,</i>

17:43.096 --> 17:47.098
<i>she left with a</i>
<i>childhood friend</i>
<i>named Paul Martin, age 16,</i>

17:47.100 --> 17:50.234
<i>who was supposed to drop</i>
<i>her off at a slumber party.</i>

17:52.337 --> 17:55.306
<i> Paul's body was found</i>
<i>lying on its left side.</i>

17:55.308 --> 17:55.306
<i>Blood was found further down</i>

17:55.308 --> 17:59.143
<i>on the other side of the road</i>
<i>by a fence.</i>

18:04.516 --> 18:08.186
Right over here,
Paul Martin's body was found.

18:08.188 --> 18:08.186
<i>He had been shot twice,</i>

18:08.188 --> 18:13.658
and then he crawled
across the street, over to here,

18:13.660 --> 18:16.661
and then whoever did it
shot him again twice.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.463
They said he put up a struggle.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.598
He had a bullet
through his hand...

18:20.600 --> 18:21.600
Right.

18:21.601 --> 18:21.599
Raised his hand,

18:21.601 --> 18:26.370
probably begged
not to be killed, and then...

18:26.372 --> 18:28.639
<i>They found him</i>
<i>at 6:30 in the morning.</i>

18:28.641 --> 18:32.110
<i>Betty Jo booker</i>
<i>was nowhere around.</i>

18:32.112 --> 18:33.144
<i>Although supposedly</i>

18:33.146 --> 18:33.144
<i>only the names had been changed</i>

18:33.146 --> 18:35.746
in <i> the town</i>
<i>that dreaded sundown,</i>

18:35.748 --> 18:37.682
<i>one of the most egregious</i>
<i>fictionalizations</i>

18:37.684 --> 18:40.251
<i>had Betty Jo booker</i>
<i>playing the trombone</i>

18:40.253 --> 18:42.086
<i>instead of the saxophone,</i>

18:42.088 --> 18:45.289
<i>the reason being to show</i>
<i>a more terrifying demise.</i>

18:45.291 --> 18:45.289
<i>The scene was so memorable,</i>

18:45.291 --> 18:50.628
<i>some people in town actually</i>
<i>think that's how she died.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:01.640
<i>The actual site</i>

19:01.641 --> 19:04.909
<i>of where Betty Jo booker's</i>
<i>body was found,</i>

19:04.911 --> 19:07.311
<i>along the edge</i>
<i>of a forgotten road,</i>

19:07.313 --> 19:09.147
<i>had eluded many.</i>

19:09.149 --> 19:10.681
<i>Lost in time</i>
<i>when a section of the park</i>

19:10.683 --> 19:12.350
<i>was turned into housing,</i>

19:12.352 --> 19:15.586
<i>this was one mystery</i>
<i>we were determined to solve.</i>

19:15.588 --> 19:17.922
<i>She was found two Miles away</i>

19:17.924 --> 19:20.124
<i>from Martin's body.</i>

19:20.126 --> 19:21.259
<i>The road's closed.</i>

19:22.694 --> 19:26.264
<i>Here's where we think</i>
<i>this road continues on.</i>

19:26.266 --> 19:28.466
<i>See that line</i>
<i>between those two trees?</i>

19:28.468 --> 19:29.667
Totally.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.237
<i>That's the road</i>
<i>that's been overgrown.</i>

19:33.239 --> 19:34.605
Keep that flashlight down.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.907
Just turn it down.

19:38.912 --> 19:39.912
Look at that.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.647
<i>This looked exactly like</i>
<i>the older road.</i>

19:42.649 --> 19:44.448
<i>It is the old road basically</i>

19:44.450 --> 19:46.817
<i>that we just went through</i>
<i>somebody's backyard to get to.</i>

19:54.594 --> 19:55.560
<i>What is it?</i>

19:55.562 --> 19:56.842
<i>It's a big spider web...</i>

19:58.630 --> 20:02.967
<i>It's halfway between</i>
<i>the two ends.</i>

20:02.969 --> 20:06.737
<i>This is Betty Jo booker,</i>
<i>15 years old.</i>

20:06.739 --> 20:08.906
<i> Shot twice,</i>
<i>once to the left rib</i>

20:08.908 --> 20:11.542
<i>and once in the face,</i>
<i>to the left cheek.</i>

20:11.544 --> 20:13.211
<i> Well, she's fully</i>
<i>clothed...</i>

20:13.213 --> 20:15.346
<i>Fully clothed, yeah.</i>

20:15.348 --> 20:17.548
<i> Her overcoat</i>
<i>has been buttoned up,</i>

20:17.550 --> 20:19.917
<i>and her hand</i>
<i>was put in her pocket.</i>

20:19.919 --> 20:25.489
<i>Strange.</i>

20:25.491 --> 20:27.291
<i>See that picture for a second?</i>

20:35.834 --> 20:36.834
<i>Doesn't it look like it?</i>

20:36.836 --> 20:38.669
It must.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.938
<i> Like if you're</i>
<i>looking at it like that,</i>

20:40.940 --> 20:42.473
<i>add 60 years.</i>

20:46.245 --> 20:47.545
<i> It could be.</i>

20:47.782 --> 20:48.981
<i>I feel bad, though.</i>

20:48.982 --> 20:54.719
You know, we're never going to
really know who killed her.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.696
<i> What happened to</i>
<i>Paul Martin and Betty Jo booker</i>

21:05.698 --> 21:08.032
<i>out on these roads</i>
<i>over 60 years ago</i>

21:08.034 --> 21:09.667
<i>was horrific enough.</i>

21:09.669 --> 21:11.636
<i>Their deaths</i>
<i>didn't need to be rewritten</i>

21:11.638 --> 21:14.505
<i>for more blood or Gore.</i>

21:14.507 --> 21:17.842
<i>Coming out here, you realize</i>
<i>that real life is just as scary</i>

21:17.844 --> 21:22.380
<i>as any horror film...</i>
<i>and sometimes even more.</i>

21:28.287 --> 21:30.888
<i>This is Marc bledsoe,</i>
<i>a former probation officer</i>

21:30.890 --> 21:32.490
<i>who was obsessed with the case</i>

21:32.492 --> 21:33.991
<i>and conducted his own</i>
<i>investigation.</i>

21:33.993 --> 21:37.028
I developed a passion,
I guess in the '90s.

21:37.030 --> 21:40.898
I saw the film, of course,
when I was a seventh grader,

21:40.900 --> 21:42.366
and I was pretty scared

21:42.368 --> 21:44.335
because of the way
the film ends.

21:44.337 --> 21:44.335
It shows the boots

21:44.337 --> 21:46.837
and said he could still
be walking the town.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.773
<i>I wanted to know</i>
<i>what the truth was.</i>

21:50.542 --> 21:52.343
<i> Bledsoe was one of</i>
<i>the only people</i>

21:52.345 --> 21:55.813
<i>to interview youell swinney</i>
<i>in recent years.</i>

21:55.815 --> 21:57.615
<i>Swinney, who was out of jail</i>

21:57.617 --> 21:59.350
<i>and living in</i>
<i>a Texas nursing home,</i>

21:59.352 --> 22:01.585
<i>had suffered a stroke</i>
<i>the year before,</i>

22:01.587 --> 22:03.888
<i>making his speech</i>
<i>difficult to decipher.</i>

22:11.596 --> 22:13.030
Fifty... sixty years?

22:15.967 --> 22:18.502
<i>But she said you and her</i>
<i>were together</i>

22:18.504 --> 22:19.737
<i>at spring lake park.</i>

22:19.739 --> 22:20.739
Hear that?

22:20.740 --> 22:24.141
They drove out there together
at spring lake.
What did he say?

22:31.917 --> 22:33.451
<i>No, I wasn't.</i>

22:33.453 --> 22:34.952
<i> Who do you think</i>
<i>was the main...</i>

22:34.954 --> 22:36.987
I don't know.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.092
<i>You wish they'd catch him.</i>

22:41.094 --> 22:42.793
<i>Hm, interesting.</i>

22:55.374 --> 22:57.508
<i>Hi. I just wanted</i>
<i>to check one thing.</i>

22:57.510 --> 22:59.377
<i>They told me</i>
<i>you all were videotaping?</i>

22:59.379 --> 23:01.445
<i>Have you all signed the thing?</i>

23:01.447 --> 23:02.480
<i>Ugh!</i>

23:04.450 --> 23:05.983
I feel like
there was more there.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.922
<i>Despite being so close,</i>

23:11.924 --> 23:13.657
<i>we still didn't have</i>
<i>an answer as to who</i>

23:13.659 --> 23:17.628
<i>the phantom really was...</i>
<i>and we probably never will.</i>

23:17.630 --> 23:19.497
<i> What happened</i>
<i>to the phantom killer</i>

23:19.499 --> 23:21.799
<i>no one really knows.</i>

23:21.801 --> 23:24.769
<i>Some believe he was convicted</i>
<i>of another crime,</i>

23:24.771 --> 23:29.073
<i>and today he is still serving</i>
<i>his term in a Kansas prison.</i>

23:29.075 --> 23:30.808
<i>It's these lack of answers</i>

23:30.810 --> 23:32.810
<i>that allows a legend to endure</i>

23:32.812 --> 23:35.579
<i>for the teenagers in texarkana.</i>

23:35.581 --> 23:36.914
<i>So, what do you think</i>
<i>the next chapter is</i>

23:36.916 --> 23:37.916
<i>in that legend?</i>

23:37.917 --> 23:40.384
Probably more ghost stories,

23:40.386 --> 23:45.656
maybe more kids
trying to scare other kids.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.025
Do you think it will ever end?

23:48.027 --> 23:50.027
I think eventually
it will fade out,

23:50.029 --> 23:52.530
but I wouldn't be able to say
for how long.

23:52.532 --> 23:55.399
I mean, legends
last for a long time.

23:55.401 --> 23:56.400
<i>So this is the tree where,</i>

23:56.402 --> 23:58.502
<i>because of the movies,</i>
<i>some people think</i>

23:58.504 --> 24:02.440
<i>Betty Jo booker was actually</i>
<i>killed with the trombone.</i>

24:02.442 --> 24:05.109
<i>I think why this is so</i>
<i>kind of important</i>

24:05.111 --> 24:09.647
<i>is because so many people</i>
<i>believed the fiction,</i>

24:09.649 --> 24:11.048
<i>and the fiction became reality,</i>

24:11.050 --> 24:11.949
<i>and in this town...</i>

24:11.951 --> 24:14.151
I really think
what's interesting is...

24:14.153 --> 24:15.619
they can't separate the two.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.521
Well, I think it's more
romantic, though,

24:17.523 --> 24:17.521
to believe in the myth

24:17.523 --> 24:21.192
than to have the facts
in front of you.

24:21.194 --> 24:22.693
<i> You have the</i>
<i>whole town coming out</i>

24:22.695 --> 24:26.664
<i>and watching a fictionalized</i>
<i>version of that,</i>

24:26.666 --> 24:28.732
<i>and that's just like little kids</i>

24:28.734 --> 24:32.636
<i>telling a fictionalized version</i>
<i>of what really happened.</i>

24:32.638 --> 24:34.905
<i>That's what an urban legend is.</i>

24:34.907 --> 24:37.641
<i>Where does the truth end</i>
<i>and the fiction begin?</i>

24:37.643 --> 24:40.211
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>no one quite knows.</i>

24:40.213 --> 24:43.581
<i> Texarkana today still</i>
<i>looks pretty much the same,</i>

24:43.583 --> 24:45.783
<i>and if you should ask people</i>
<i>here on the streets</i>

24:45.785 --> 24:49.186
<i>what they believe happened</i>
<i>to the phantom killer,</i>

24:49.188 --> 24:51.989
<i>most would say</i>
<i>that he is still living here</i>

24:53.658 --> 24:55.593
<i>and is walking free.</i>

25:14.546 --> 25:15.980
So right now,
we're driving into Houston.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.249
We're going to investigate
the urban legend

25:18.251 --> 25:20.050
of the candy man.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.585
<i>The name candy man</i>

25:21.587 --> 25:23.854
<i>has a lot of</i>
<i>urban legend references.</i>

25:23.856 --> 25:26.924
<i>Obviously, one of the most</i>
<i>well-known is the film Candyman</i>

25:26.926 --> 25:29.059
<i>based on the clive barker</i>
<i>short story</i>

25:29.061 --> 25:32.229
<i>about an urban legend expert</i>
<i>investigating the boogeyman</i>

25:32.231 --> 25:36.867
<i>who haunts the cabrini-green</i>
<i>housing projects in Chicago.</i>

25:36.869 --> 25:39.703
<i>With my hook for a hand,</i>

25:39.705 --> 25:44.542
<i>I'll split you from your groin</i>
<i>to your gullet.</i>

25:46.612 --> 25:48.112
<i> Here the Candyman</i>
<i>uses a hook,</i>

25:48.114 --> 25:50.214
<i>just like the well-known</i>
<i>hook urban legend</i>

25:50.216 --> 25:52.616
<i>where it was probably</i>
<i>appropriated from,</i>

25:52.618 --> 25:54.952
<i>but the film's villain</i>
<i>wasn't the first candy man.</i>

25:54.954 --> 25:54.952
<i>The original was, in fact,</i>

25:54.954 --> 25:59.723
<i>a very real monster behind</i>
<i>one of the most horrific crimes</i>

25:59.725 --> 26:01.926
<i>anyone could ever imagine.</i>

26:03.828 --> 26:06.630
<i> We've all heard the</i>
<i>same story about Halloween.</i>

26:06.632 --> 26:09.133
<i>Little Johnny had been warned</i>
<i>never to go trick-or-treating</i>

26:09.135 --> 26:12.836
<i>at any house he didn't know,</i>
<i>but he didn't listen.</i>

26:12.838 --> 26:14.672
<i>Instead, he convinces</i>
<i>his friends</i>

26:14.674 --> 26:17.608
<i>to go get candy</i>
<i>from this one weird house.</i>

26:17.610 --> 26:18.642
<i>Later that night,</i>

26:18.644 --> 26:20.711
<i>as they're all digging</i>
<i>through their loot,</i>

26:20.713 --> 26:22.613
<i>there's this scream.</i>

26:22.615 --> 26:24.214
<i>All the kids</i>
<i>are rushed to the hospital,</i>

26:24.216 --> 26:25.983
<i>but it's too late.</i>

26:25.985 --> 26:29.053
<i>Johnny's dead from eating</i>
<i>candy laced with poison,</i>

26:29.055 --> 26:32.022
<i>and all the other kids</i>
<i>had their mouths ripped open</i>

26:32.024 --> 26:34.725
<i>from swallowing</i>
<i>razor blades and glass.</i>

26:34.727 --> 26:36.827
<i>They never did catch</i>
<i>the person who did it.</i>

26:36.829 --> 26:39.096
<i>Turns out, Halloween</i>
<i>really comes from</i>

26:39.098 --> 26:42.766
<i>the ancient custom of druids</i>
<i>collecting kids for sacrifices,</i>

26:42.768 --> 26:45.636
<i>and apparently these murders</i>
<i>were committed by those</i>

26:45.638 --> 26:48.072
<i>who still carry on</i>
<i>that evil tradition.</i>

26:49.808 --> 26:51.909
<i> So does our modern-day</i>
<i>custom of trick-or-treating</i>

26:51.911 --> 26:55.846
<i>really stem from evil druids</i>
<i>and child sacrifices?</i>

26:55.848 --> 26:58.315
<i>It's highly unlikely,</i>
<i>but there's no denying</i>

26:58.317 --> 27:00.985
<i>that something very sinister</i>
<i>is out there</i>

27:00.987 --> 27:04.989
<i>instilling panic and inciting</i>
<i>fear every Halloween.</i>

27:05.957 --> 27:06.957
<i>There's one magical,</i>

27:06.959 --> 27:11.729
<i>haunted evening each year</i>
<i>when all the scary creatures</i>

27:11.731 --> 27:14.164
<i>come out to prowl through</i>
<i>every neighborhood.</i>

27:14.166 --> 27:16.233
<i>Most people enjoy having</i>
<i>trick-or-treaters</i>

27:16.235 --> 27:17.534
<i>come to their doors,</i>

27:17.536 --> 27:22.906
<i>but there are a few people who</i>
<i>will do things to hurt kids.</i>

27:22.908 --> 27:25.175
<i> The first documented</i>
<i>case of tainted candy</i>

27:25.177 --> 27:28.078
<i>happened on long island in 1964</i>

27:28.080 --> 27:30.147
<i>when a housewife</i>
<i>named Helen pfeil,</i>

27:30.149 --> 27:32.249
<i>upset with older kids</i>
<i>for trick-or-treating,</i>

27:32.251 --> 27:35.052
<i>handed out dog biscuits,</i>
<i>steel wool,</i>

27:35.054 --> 27:36.954
<i>and poison ant buttons.</i>

27:36.956 --> 27:39.223
<i>Although pfeil testified</i>
<i>that it was just a joke,</i>

27:39.225 --> 27:42.326
<i>she was still found guilty</i>
<i>of endangering children.</i>

27:42.328 --> 27:44.962
<i>This fear really took root</i>
<i>in the 1970s</i>

27:44.964 --> 27:46.830
<i>when outlets like newsweek</i>
<i>were reporting</i>

27:46.832 --> 27:51.001
<i>that several children had died</i>
<i>from poison or tainted candy.</i>

27:51.003 --> 27:53.971
Some schools stopped
celebrating Halloween.

27:53.973 --> 27:56.407
They stopped using the word
"Halloween",

27:56.409 --> 27:59.743
and they start talking
about having a fall festival.

27:59.745 --> 28:05.249
New Jersey passed a law of
specifying penalties for people

28:05.251 --> 28:08.218
who were caught contaminating
Halloween treats.

28:08.220 --> 28:13.323
<i>In the 1980s, hospitals</i>
<i>began offering X-ray treats.</i>

28:13.325 --> 28:15.259
<i> All nextcare urgent</i>
<i>care locations</i>

28:15.261 --> 28:18.796
<i>are offering free candy x-rays</i>
<i>through tomorrow.</i>

28:18.798 --> 28:18.796
We haven't had any instances

28:18.798 --> 28:22.099
where we found
any tampered candy,

28:22.101 --> 28:22.099
but you read it in the news

28:22.101 --> 28:25.402
and you see all of these
crazy pictures online,

28:25.404 --> 28:27.271
and so, you know,
if I were a parent,

28:27.273 --> 28:29.873
I would be a little bit
concerned as well.

28:31.309 --> 28:34.678
<i> We don't worry about</i>
<i>ghosts and goblins anymore,</i>

28:34.680 --> 28:36.180
but we fear this maniac,

28:36.182 --> 28:40.284
this anonymous person
who is so crazy

28:40.286 --> 28:47.124
that he presumably poisons
little children at random.

28:47.126 --> 28:50.461
I think about how much fun
Halloween is.

28:50.463 --> 28:53.097
I also worry a little bit
about the things

28:53.099 --> 28:55.899
that can spoil
the fun of Halloween.

28:55.901 --> 28:59.803
Those kinds of things scare me,
too, but in a different way.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.073
<i>The one case of tainted candy</i>

29:03.075 --> 29:05.809
<i>that seemed to bring</i>
<i>this nightmare to life</i>

29:05.811 --> 29:09.446
<i>happened on a rainy Halloween</i>
<i>night in Pasadena, Texas.</i>

29:09.448 --> 29:11.148
<i>The perpetrator</i>
<i>of this evil crime</i>

29:11.150 --> 29:14.852
<i>is known to some</i>
<i>as the man who killed Halloween</i>

29:14.854 --> 29:19.189
<i>and to others as simply</i>
<i>the candy man.</i>

29:19.191 --> 29:21.959
<i>On October 31, 1974,</i>

29:21.961 --> 29:24.895
<i>after trick-or-treating</i>
<i>with their friends,</i>
<i>the bateses,</i>

29:24.897 --> 29:27.865
<i>Ronald o'Bryan let his son</i>
<i>Timothy, age 8,</i>

29:27.867 --> 29:29.867
<i>and his sister Elizabeth, 5,</i>

29:29.869 --> 29:32.503
<i>each pick out a piece of candy</i>
<i>before bed.</i>

29:32.505 --> 29:35.205
<i>Timothy, still wearing his</i>
<i>planet of the apes costume,</i>

29:35.207 --> 29:37.007
<i>chose a giant pixy styx,</i>

29:37.009 --> 29:38.776
<i>one of five</i>
<i>that his father had gotten</i>

29:38.778 --> 29:40.778
<i>from a neighborhood house</i>
<i>that night.</i>

29:40.780 --> 29:43.080
<i>Ronald had divvyed up</i>
<i>the other styx to his daughter,</i>

29:43.082 --> 29:44.348
<i>one of the bates' kids,</i>

29:44.350 --> 29:47.017
<i>and a local boy</i>
<i>named Whitney Parker.</i>

29:47.019 --> 29:48.752
<i>The sugar inside</i>
<i>had clumped together,</i>

29:48.754 --> 29:50.854
<i>so Ronald rolled the styx</i>
<i>in his hands</i>

29:50.856 --> 29:53.524
<i>before pouring the powder</i>
<i>down his son's throat.</i>

29:53.526 --> 29:56.160
<i>Minutes later,</i>
<i>Timothy was violently vomiting,</i>

29:56.162 --> 29:58.095
<i>and after being rushed</i>
<i>to the hospital,</i>

29:58.097 --> 30:00.030
<i>he was pronounced dead.</i>

30:00.032 --> 30:02.533
<i>The cause...</i>
<i>cyanide poisoning.</i>

30:02.535 --> 30:06.036
I was off duty at the time
on Halloween night

30:06.038 --> 30:09.840
when I received a call
from one of my detectives.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.775
<i>I drove to southmore hospital,</i>

30:11.777 --> 30:14.144
and what I saw
was very, very disturbing...

30:14.146 --> 30:17.414
not only because there was
a child there that was dead

30:17.416 --> 30:20.884
that had cyanide foam
coming out of his mouth,

30:20.886 --> 30:25.088
<i>but it was a small,</i>
<i>blond-headed young boy,</i>

30:25.090 --> 30:26.290
<i>and I looked at this child...</i>

30:26.292 --> 30:30.060
and I had at the time
a small, blond-headed,

30:30.062 --> 30:33.363
eight-year-old son
lying in a bed in my home...

30:33.365 --> 30:38.468
and it absolutely
just almost destroyed you

30:38.470 --> 30:41.038
to see something like that.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.372
<i> Had you ever heard</i>
<i>of the idea of</i>

30:42.374 --> 30:44.808
<i>candy tampering before that?</i>

30:44.810 --> 30:45.809
<i>I had heard about it...</i>

30:45.811 --> 30:47.411
<i>I had never seen it personally,</i>

30:47.413 --> 30:51.849
but you know, you're always
concerned on Halloween,

30:51.851 --> 30:56.019
<i>and the next night</i>
<i>we had a grieving father,</i>

30:56.021 --> 30:59.356
a grieving mother,
and a grieving little sister.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.992
I put my arm around
Mr. o'Bryan's shoulder

31:01.994 --> 31:06.029
and I promised him,
"I promise you we will catch

31:06.031 --> 31:08.866
this individual
that did this to your son."

31:10.034 --> 31:12.169
<i> Timothy's death</i>
<i>was a terrible blow,</i>

31:12.171 --> 31:15.339
<i>not just for the family,</i>
<i>but for many in Pasadena.</i>

31:15.341 --> 31:17.407
<i>As crowds of o'Bryan's</i>
<i>fellow churchgoers</i>

31:17.409 --> 31:19.176
<i>flooded the cemetery,</i>

31:19.178 --> 31:22.246
<i>Timothy's father quickly</i>
<i>reduced the mourners to tears</i>

31:22.248 --> 31:26.850
<i>as he sang a hymn for the boy</i>
<i>who was now in heaven.</i>

31:26.852 --> 31:29.319
I introduced myself
to Mr. o'Bryan

31:29.321 --> 31:32.222
and said I'm a reporter
for the Houston chronicle.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.158
Is Mrs. o'Bryan
available to talk?

31:35.160 --> 31:38.095
He said, you know,
she's really, as we all are,

31:38.097 --> 31:41.098
just torn up about this,
but if you want to talk,

31:41.100 --> 31:44.301
come on in,
and I'll try to talk to you.

31:44.303 --> 31:47.271
<i>And he said, you know,</i>
<i>I held my son in my arms</i>

31:47.273 --> 31:51.341
<i>while he died, and I cried.</i>

31:51.343 --> 31:53.977
I thought
that they had been victimized

31:53.979 --> 31:57.881
by a random crazy man, lunatic.

31:57.883 --> 32:01.652
<i>The original suspects</i>
<i>were people in Pasadena</i>

32:01.654 --> 32:04.655
who were living inhabitants
of the homes

32:04.657 --> 32:07.524
where they did
the trick-or-treat.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.493
<i>4108, 4106,</i>

32:11.229 --> 32:12.229
<i>-102.</i>

32:12.231 --> 32:14.264
<i>Right here.</i>

32:14.266 --> 32:15.666
<i>4102.</i>

32:15.668 --> 32:17.901
<i>So right here</i>
<i>is the bates' house</i>

32:17.903 --> 32:21.571
<i>from where o'Bryan</i>
<i>and the bateses</i>

32:21.573 --> 32:23.407
both went trick-or-treating.

32:23.409 --> 32:24.608
<i>After the funeral,</i>

32:24.610 --> 32:27.144
<i>the police took o'Bryan around</i>
<i>the bates' neighborhood,</i>

32:27.146 --> 32:28.378
<i>but he couldn't</i>
<i>remember the house</i>

32:28.380 --> 32:30.314
<i>where he had gotten</i>
<i>the pixy styk.</i>

32:30.316 --> 32:34.017
<i>Finally, he ID'd a neighbor</i>
<i>named Courtney Melvin.</i>

32:34.019 --> 32:37.454
<i>Ten, right here</i>
<i>where this blue car is.</i>

32:37.456 --> 32:39.923
<i>This is Courtney Melvin's place,</i>

32:39.925 --> 32:43.026
<i>so basically Courtney</i>
<i>was out on his lawn.</i>

32:43.028 --> 32:45.495
<i>O'Bryan was driving by,</i>
<i>fingered this guy</i>

32:45.497 --> 32:48.498
<i>as being the person</i>
<i>where he got the pixy styx.</i>

32:48.500 --> 32:49.933
<i>The only problem being</i>

32:49.935 --> 32:52.536
<i>Courtney Melvin</i>
<i>had an airtight alibi.</i>

32:54.439 --> 32:57.007
<i>As the killer continued</i>
<i>to elude police,</i>

32:57.009 --> 32:57.007
<i>the nature of his crime</i>

32:57.009 --> 33:01.278
<i>only seemed to confirm</i>
<i>everyone's worst fears...</i>

33:01.280 --> 33:03.447
<i>a fear that still</i>
<i>resonates today.</i>

33:03.449 --> 33:05.415
<i>Do you know about the crime</i>
<i>that happened?</i>

33:05.417 --> 33:08.318
Oh, yes, you're talking about
the candy man.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.320
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:09.321 --> 33:11.054
Uh-hm.
It was the first time

33:11.056 --> 33:13.090
that I heard of people
doing that...

33:13.092 --> 33:15.726
And then I heard of them
putting more cyanide

33:15.728 --> 33:17.394
and razor blades.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.062
I've heard fish hooks.

33:19.064 --> 33:21.498
<i>The way society is getting</i>
<i>right now, I mean,</i>

33:21.500 --> 33:21.498
you don't ever know
what's going to happen.

33:21.500 --> 33:26.436
I'm like, nope, no candy until
I look, you know, through it.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.437
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

33:27.439 --> 33:29.239
You know, an open wrapper,

33:29.241 --> 33:31.575
just seeing if anything
has a hole in it.

33:31.577 --> 33:32.676
You don't trust nobody.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.578
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Can't.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.179
I actually heard
about some guy doing it

33:36.181 --> 33:37.447
in this neighborhood one time,
but...

33:37.449 --> 33:37.447
What's that story.

33:37.449 --> 33:41.318
I think he actually lived
over there by the ditch.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.354
And they do all sacrifice crap
over there during Halloween.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.423
Do you think there are
satanists around?

33:46.425 --> 33:47.591
There probably is.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.192
I mean, knowing this
neighborhood...

33:49.194 --> 33:50.560
there are sickos around here.

33:50.562 --> 33:50.560
<i>Tonight is Halloween</i>

33:50.562 --> 33:54.464
<i>and children will be out</i>
<i>to trick-or-treat.</i>

33:54.466 --> 33:56.767
<i>We hope that the treats</i>
<i>will be many</i>

33:56.769 --> 33:58.335
<i>and the tricks ingenious.</i>

33:58.337 --> 34:00.137
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>people give children</i>

34:00.139 --> 34:02.339
<i>bad things on Halloween.</i>

34:02.341 --> 34:02.339
<i>In shreveport, Louisiana,</i>

34:02.341 --> 34:06.309
<i>an old legend that actually</i>
<i>happened this time.</i>

34:06.311 --> 34:06.309
<i>Halloween is on Sunday,</i>

34:06.311 --> 34:09.312
<i>and there is a spreading fear</i>
<i>that this year,</i>

34:09.313 --> 34:09.312
<i>the real Halloween scare</i>

34:09.313 --> 34:14.051
<i>will be many more cases</i>
<i>of contaminated treats.</i>

34:15.186 --> 34:17.654
<i> The term that gets used</i>
<i>is "Halloween sadist".</i>

34:17.656 --> 34:20.090
People assume
that the Halloween sadist

34:20.092 --> 34:24.094
was some crazy person who,
for some reason...

34:24.096 --> 34:28.065
presumably you know,
some psychological problem...

34:28.067 --> 34:32.135
<i>gets pleasure or satisfaction</i>
<i>from hurting little kids.</i>

34:32.900 --> 34:34.639
<i>Many people believe</i>

34:34.639 --> 34:38.675
<i>the Halloween sadist</i>
<i>was behind Timothy's death,</i>

34:38.677 --> 34:41.078
<i>but the real culprit</i>
<i>was more horrific</i>

34:41.080 --> 34:42.813
<i>than anyone had ever imagined.</i>

34:46.317 --> 34:49.252
It's down here,
I think, on the left.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.822
<i>All right, so gray,</i>
<i>how do you want to do this?</i>

34:52.824 --> 34:54.324
I'll just, I'll hang back here.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.193
<i> Okay.</i>
<i>So we're going to go up.</i>

34:56.195 --> 34:57.594
I'm not totally into this.

34:57.596 --> 34:57.594
I can understand.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.664
I can understand
why you'd want to do this...

35:00.666 --> 35:00.664
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:00.666 --> 35:03.500
It just makes me feel
a little uncomfortable.

35:03.502 --> 35:03.500
Knocking on someone's house

35:03.502 --> 35:07.337
and telling them
what tragedy happened here.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.940
<i> Well, you wouldn't</i>
<i>want to know?</i>

35:14.579 --> 35:15.679
Oh, hey, how are you?

35:15.681 --> 35:15.679
Hi, how are you?

35:15.681 --> 35:19.216
Hey, sorry to bother you.
We wanted to talk to you.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.318
We're doing a documentary
and wanted to talk to you

35:21.320 --> 35:23.353
about the family
that lived here before.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.355
Do you know him?

35:24.356 --> 35:25.422
Do you know
Ronald Clark o'Bryan?

35:25.424 --> 35:26.424
Uh-uh.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.492
No, you have no idea about him?

35:31.195 --> 35:32.496
Nah, don't worry about it.

35:33.431 --> 35:33.430
Thanks very much.

35:33.432 --> 35:37.334
You want to know?
Do you really want to know?

35:37.336 --> 35:38.668
Do you really want to know?

35:38.670 --> 35:40.470
So the guy who lived in here

35:40.472 --> 35:42.739
was a guy named
Ronald Clark o'Bryan.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.641
He gave his son
a poison pixy styk.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.145
Yeah.
He killed...

35:49.881 --> 35:51.148
That's right.

35:53.651 --> 35:54.818
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

35:54.820 --> 35:57.754
<i>eight-year-old Timothy o'Bryan</i>
<i>of Pasadena, Texas,</i>

35:57.756 --> 36:00.490
<i>died after eating a piece of</i>
<i>trick-or-treat candy</i>

36:00.492 --> 36:02.159
<i>that contained cyanide.</i>

36:02.161 --> 36:04.761
<i>Today Pasadena police arrested</i>
<i>the boy's father,</i>

36:04.763 --> 36:07.330
<i>30-year-old Ronald o'Bryan,</i>
<i>on murder charges.</i>

36:07.332 --> 36:09.132
<i>Police refused to</i>
<i>discuss the case</i>

36:09.134 --> 36:10.901
<i>other than to say</i>
<i>the district attorney believes</i>

36:10.903 --> 36:14.337
<i>he has sufficient evidence</i>
<i>to file charges.</i>

36:16.707 --> 36:19.142
<i> After receiving a call</i>
<i>from an insurance agent,</i>

36:19.144 --> 36:21.745
<i>police discovered o'Bryan</i>
<i>had taken out a large policy</i>

36:21.747 --> 36:25.382
<i>on his kids but not himself</i>
<i>nor his wife.</i>

36:25.384 --> 36:25.382
<i>Even more damning,</i>

36:25.384 --> 36:29.386
<i>he had talked to</i>
<i>numerous people</i>
<i>about death by cyanide</i>

36:29.388 --> 36:31.288
<i>and had even tried</i>
<i>to buy the chemical</i>

36:31.290 --> 36:32.689
<i>from local companies.</i>

36:34.725 --> 36:36.693
<i>All evidence pointed</i>
<i>to Timothy's father</i>

36:36.695 --> 36:39.629
<i>as the killer which,</i>
<i>as horrific as it sounds,</i>

36:39.631 --> 36:41.364
<i>makes some sense,</i>

36:41.366 --> 36:44.401
<i>and that's because</i>
<i>the Halloween sadist is a myth,</i>

36:44.403 --> 36:45.902
<i>and the notion</i>
<i>of candy tampering</i>

36:45.904 --> 36:49.739
<i>is really an urban legend.</i>

36:49.741 --> 36:52.475
The idea that this is
a big social problem is a myth.

36:52.477 --> 36:54.744
I can't tell you
nobody has ever contaminated

36:54.746 --> 36:56.346
a piece of candy,

36:56.348 --> 37:01.952
but I can't find any evidence
that anybody has ever been hurt,

37:01.954 --> 37:05.488
seriously hurt or killed,
from a contaminated treat

37:05.490 --> 37:07.390
picked up in the course of
trick-or-treating.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.391
<i>If there's no such thing</i>

37:08.393 --> 37:09.626
<i>as the Halloween sadist,</i>

37:09.628 --> 37:12.562
<i>who is, in fact, doing that?</i>

37:12.564 --> 37:14.331
Probably the kids.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.198
<i>If you think about it,</i>

37:15.200 --> 37:17.567
<i>this is a terrific</i>
<i>kind of prank.</i>

37:17.569 --> 37:19.903
<i>It's easy enough</i>
<i>to come by a pin,</i>

37:19.905 --> 37:22.405
<i>easy enough to stick it</i>
<i>in the candy bar,</i>

37:22.407 --> 37:24.908
and then run in and say,
look mom,

37:24.910 --> 37:26.810
there's a pin in my candy bar...

37:26.812 --> 37:29.779
and you become the object
of the concerned attention

37:29.781 --> 37:32.983
of your parents
and possibly even the press

37:32.985 --> 37:34.384
and the police.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.355
<i> While the fear of</i>
<i>tainted candy may be hysteria,</i>

37:38.357 --> 37:40.557
<i>Timothy's death was real...</i>

37:40.559 --> 37:42.292
<i>but was it really conceivable</i>

37:42.294 --> 37:43.994
<i>that a father could kill</i>
<i>his own child...</i>

37:43.996 --> 37:49.366
<i>and if so, what kind of monster</i>
<i>was Ronald Clark o'Bryan?</i>

37:49.368 --> 37:52.636
Look at that lying
son of a bitch.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.438
<i>I thought just like Mr. o'Bryan</i>
<i>wanted us to think...</i>

37:55.440 --> 37:56.873
that there was some maniac
out there

37:56.875 --> 38:01.511
randomly giving these poison
pixy styx to little kids.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.313
That's exactly what
he wanted us to think,

38:03.315 --> 38:04.681
and that's what we thought.

38:04.683 --> 38:10.520
It's hard to accept
that a human being

38:10.522 --> 38:11.855
was willing to do that,

38:11.857 --> 38:16.559
and it's still difficult
for all of us.

38:16.561 --> 38:21.798
The people in this case were
forever affected by what he did

38:21.800 --> 38:24.734
and by that,
I mean the bates kids...

38:24.736 --> 38:27.704
he was going to kill
his friends own two kids...

38:27.706 --> 38:30.407
and little Whitney Parker,

38:30.409 --> 38:30.407
and he would have
killed his daughter

38:30.409 --> 38:34.544
if the ambulance and police
hadn't gotten there so fast.

38:34.546 --> 38:38.014
No good prosecutor wants to go
to trial at all on anything

38:38.016 --> 38:39.916
unless they believe
in their own heart

38:39.918 --> 38:43.053
that the defendant is guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt,

38:43.055 --> 38:45.655
and seeking the death penalty
is just an extra dimension

38:45.657 --> 38:49.592
of care and consideration
that should be given.

38:49.594 --> 38:50.727
You wanted to keep the case.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.062
I sure did.
Why?

38:52.064 --> 38:53.496
I wanted to hopefully
have a hand

38:53.498 --> 38:55.398
in seeing that justice was done

38:55.400 --> 38:57.467
and that he would die
for what he did.

38:59.403 --> 39:01.304
<i>It took a jury only 45 minutes</i>

39:01.306 --> 39:03.039
<i>to find o'Bryan guilty</i>

39:03.041 --> 39:06.343
<i>and another 75</i>
<i>to sentence him to death.</i>

39:06.345 --> 39:06.343
<i>In a fitting irony,</i>

39:06.345 --> 39:13.883
<i>he was scheduled to die on</i>
<i>October 31, 1976, Halloween.</i>

39:13.885 --> 39:15.985
<i> I have stated</i>
<i>from the very beginning</i>

39:15.987 --> 39:19.556
<i>that I had absolutely</i>
<i>nothing at all to do with this.</i>

39:19.558 --> 39:21.391
<i>I maintain that now,</i>

39:21.393 --> 39:23.660
<i>and I'll willing</i>
<i>to take a polygraph now,</i>

39:23.662 --> 39:25.795
<i>just like I was</i>
<i>from the very first time</i>

39:25.797 --> 39:26.930
<i>that they arrested me.</i>

39:26.932 --> 39:26.930
<i>Because I have no guilt,</i>

39:26.932 --> 39:31.401
<i>I'm not worried about what</i>
<i>happens to my physical body.</i>

39:31.403 --> 39:34.437
<i>When I die,</i>
<i>I know where I'm going.</i>

39:34.439 --> 39:37.507
<i> You're going straight</i>
<i>to hell, buddy.</i>

39:37.509 --> 39:39.042
<i> All these appeals</i>
<i>have been turned down</i>

39:39.044 --> 39:40.845
<i>appeal after appeal,</i>
<i>and everybody is saying</i>

39:40.846 --> 39:43.346
<i>you will be executed</i>
<i>this Saturday.</i>

39:43.348 --> 39:45.815
<i>This could be</i>
<i>your last news conference.</i>

39:45.817 --> 39:47.884
<i>What are your final thoughts?</i>

39:47.886 --> 39:48.885
<i>As long as I have</i>

39:48.887 --> 39:51.855
<i>verifiable options open to me,</i>

39:51.857 --> 39:53.056
<i>I will pursue them.</i>

39:53.058 --> 39:56.059
<i>Are you ever going to change</i>

39:56.061 --> 39:58.561
<i>your proclamation of innocence</i>
<i>or...</i>

39:58.563 --> 40:01.097
<i> No,</i>
<i>why should I? It's the truth.</i>

40:01.099 --> 40:02.766
<i>When you consider victims,</i>

40:02.768 --> 40:06.403
<i>the victim of this crime</i>
<i>actually turns out to be me.</i>

40:07.071 --> 40:08.071
<i>O'Bryan had been sent</i>

40:08.073 --> 40:11.674
<i>to Texas's infamous</i>
<i>huntsville prison</i>

40:11.676 --> 40:11.674
<i>which to this day,</i>

40:11.676 --> 40:15.812
<i>houses the most active</i>
<i>death chamber in the us,</i>

40:15.814 --> 40:17.514
<i>but this was 1982,</i>

40:17.516 --> 40:19.783
<i>and after a lengthy debate</i>
<i>in the supreme court</i>

40:19.785 --> 40:21.684
<i>and numerous stays of execution,</i>

40:21.686 --> 40:24.154
<i>o'Bryan was to be one</i>
<i>of the very first inmates</i>

40:24.156 --> 40:27.791
<i>to be executed with</i>
<i>the reinstituted death penalty.</i>

40:27.793 --> 40:29.492
<i>Yet, despite his crime,</i>

40:29.494 --> 40:32.395
<i>o'Bryan still managed</i>
<i>to find his supporters.</i>

40:32.397 --> 40:32.395
There were people

40:32.397 --> 40:38.067
who were in favor
of saving Ronald Clark o'Bryan

40:38.069 --> 40:40.103
in spite of
the overwhelming evidence

40:40.105 --> 40:41.671
and the horror of the crime.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.039
Their position was

40:43.041 --> 40:46.810
we are categorically
opposed to the death penalty.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.045
There also were
counter-protestors

40:49.047 --> 40:51.548
who were in favor
of the death penalty.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.516
<i>They included a lot of students</i>

40:53.518 --> 40:55.685
<i>from the university located here</i>

40:55.687 --> 40:58.154
<i>including many who complained</i>

40:58.156 --> 41:00.590
about what had happened
to Halloween.

41:07.898 --> 41:09.199
This is Ronald Clark o'Bryan.

41:09.201 --> 41:11.601
Mr. o'Bryan is 39 years old.

41:11.603 --> 41:14.070
It looks like you are
going to be executed.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.538
Would you agree with that?

41:15.540 --> 41:16.973
It's a possibility.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.675
I've been aware
of that possibility

41:18.677 --> 41:21.010
since the sentence
was handed down.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.879
It doesn't make it right.

41:22.881 --> 41:22.879
It's fair to say

41:22.881 --> 41:26.549
that nobody gets any joy
out of executing anybody,

41:26.551 --> 41:28.885
but it is also clear
that most Americans

41:28.887 --> 41:31.154
want to get on with this.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.723
<i>They are upset</i>
<i>that you're alive.</i>

41:33.725 --> 41:36.559
I-I can see that point, sure,
but here again,

41:36.561 --> 41:38.228
I don't think
that revenge is right.

41:38.230 --> 41:40.530
I don't think society
is entitled to revenge.

41:40.532 --> 41:44.000
<i>You are accused of ruining</i>
<i>Halloween for everybody.</i>

41:44.002 --> 41:46.236
Well,
that's a matter of opinion.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.241
<i>March 31, 1984,</i>

41:51.243 --> 41:54.744
<i>the day of o'Bryan's execution</i>
<i>had finally arrived.</i>

41:54.746 --> 41:57.914
<i>He was to be executed</i>
<i>just after midnight.</i>

41:57.916 --> 42:00.583
<i>As the hour approached,</i>
<i>the frenzy outside</i>

42:00.585 --> 42:02.886
<i>reached a fever pitch.</i>

42:02.888 --> 42:04.954
<i> Demonstrators</i>
<i>were outside the prison</i>

42:04.956 --> 42:07.857
<i>waiting for the announcement</i>
<i>they wanted to hear.</i>

42:07.859 --> 42:10.994
<i>Parents of other murdered</i>
<i>children joined the vigil.</i>

42:10.996 --> 42:13.196
You know, how could anyone do
something to their own child?

42:13.198 --> 42:14.197
<i>Dying together.</i>

42:14.199 --> 42:15.598
What all of us would give

42:15.600 --> 42:17.800
to have the chance
to have ours back.

42:20.504 --> 42:22.972
<i> Do you think Halloween</i>
<i>will ever be the same again?</i>

42:22.974 --> 42:27.110
<i>Oh, I don't think Halloween</i>
<i>has changed a great deal,</i>

42:28.913 --> 42:31.147
<i>except maybe gotten</i>
<i>a little safer.</i>

42:33.183 --> 42:35.084
<i>At exactly 12:40 A.M.</i>

42:35.086 --> 42:38.221
<i>O'Bryan was injected with</i>
<i>a lethal cocktail of drugs,</i>

42:38.223 --> 42:39.789
<i>twice the normal amount,</i>

42:39.791 --> 42:42.659
<i>to account for</i>
<i>his 250-pound weight.</i>

42:42.661 --> 42:44.227
<i>After o'Bryan's eyes fluttered,</i>

42:44.229 --> 42:47.196
<i>his chest heaved,</i>
<i>and it was over.</i>

42:49.099 --> 42:50.166
<i>Ronald o'Bryan,</i>

42:50.168 --> 42:52.635
<i>the man fellow inmates</i>
<i>called the candy man,</i>

42:52.637 --> 42:54.871
<i>was killed by lethal injection</i>
<i>this morning</i>

42:54.873 --> 42:56.673
<i>at a huntsville, Texas, prison.</i>

42:56.675 --> 42:58.841
<i> Ronald o'Bryan</i>
<i>went to his deathbed</i>

42:58.843 --> 43:01.978
<i>never admitting</i>
<i>that he killed his own son.</i>

43:01.980 --> 43:01.978
<i>But in a final statement,</i>

43:01.980 --> 43:06.783
<i>the condemned man</i>
<i>did ask to be forgiven.</i>

43:06.785 --> 43:09.819
<i>Also to anyone</i>
<i>I have offended in any way</i>

43:09.821 --> 43:12.956
<i>during my 39 years.</i>

43:12.958 --> 43:15.024
<i>I pray and ask your forgiveness,</i>

43:15.026 --> 43:18.227
<i>just as I forgive anyone</i>
<i>who offended me in any way.</i>

43:18.229 --> 43:20.296
<i>Ronald o'Bryan is dead.</i>

43:20.298 --> 43:24.067
<i>His ex-wife sees the execution</i>
<i>as the end of a nightmare,</i>

43:24.069 --> 43:27.103
<i>and a chance</i>
<i>for a brand new beginning.</i>

43:28.839 --> 43:31.240
<i> For many the idea</i>
<i>that we were killing the man</i>

43:31.242 --> 43:34.577
<i>who killed Halloween</i>
<i>seemed justified.</i>

43:34.579 --> 43:38.648
<i>O'Bryan had to die</i>
<i>so we could have our fun back.</i>

43:38.650 --> 43:40.984
People were celebrating it,
there's no question about it,

43:40.986 --> 43:44.120
<i>but it was</i>
<i>kind of a catharsis, really,</i>

43:44.122 --> 43:46.923
<i>and people welcomed the event.</i>

43:46.925 --> 43:51.661
He really had not just
desecrated the family tie,

43:51.663 --> 43:54.197
<i>but he had actually</i>
<i>in some fundamental way</i>

43:54.199 --> 43:57.834
<i>desecrated the idea of Halloween</i>

43:57.836 --> 44:04.641
by taking a scary story
and literally making it true.

44:04.643 --> 44:04.641
<i>What he did is</i>

44:04.643 --> 44:08.144
<i>he used the urban legend</i>
<i>as a smokescreen.</i>

44:08.146 --> 44:10.980
<i>He used it as an alibi.</i>

44:10.982 --> 44:12.281
<i>I couldn't have done it</i>

44:12.283 --> 44:14.384
<i>because this is</i>
<i>the sort of thing</i>

44:14.386 --> 44:17.220
that an anonymous
creepy killer would do,

44:17.222 --> 44:20.356
and we all know that
because of urban legends.

44:20.358 --> 44:21.524
<i>In the ultimate irony,</i>

44:21.526 --> 44:25.028
<i>o'Bryan's decision to enact</i>
<i>the tainted candy myth</i>

44:25.030 --> 44:28.031
<i>turned fiction into reality,</i>

44:28.033 --> 44:31.834
<i>allowing the candy man</i>
<i>to continue haunting Halloween</i>

44:31.836 --> 44:33.736
<i>for generations to come.</i>

44:35.639 --> 44:39.709
Look, it's right there.

44:42.980 --> 44:44.847
<i>Mr. o'Bryan, your case</i>

44:44.849 --> 44:49.786
<i>has probably created terror</i>
<i>in the hearts of parents.</i>

44:49.788 --> 44:52.221
<i>In fact, I'm told</i>
<i>that the inmates</i>

44:52.223 --> 44:55.825
<i>occasionally refer to you</i>
<i>as the candy man, is that so?</i>

45:02.433 --> 45:04.233
<i>A babysitter is watching TV</i>

45:04.235 --> 45:05.835
<i>after putting the kids to bed</i>

45:05.837 --> 45:08.237
<i>when she gets a call</i>
<i>from a mysterious stranger.</i>

45:11.710 --> 45:12.775
Hello.

45:12.777 --> 45:14.811
Have you checked the children?

45:14.813 --> 45:14.811
What?

45:14.813 --> 45:17.980
<i> Thinking it's a prank,</i>
<i>she hangs up.</i>

45:17.982 --> 45:17.980
<i>A few minutes later,</i>

45:17.982 --> 45:20.917
<i>the same mysterious man</i>
<i>calls again.</i>

45:20.919 --> 45:21.951
Hello?

45:21.953 --> 45:24.120
Have you checked the children?

45:24.122 --> 45:25.755
<i>Only now the question ends</i>

45:25.757 --> 45:27.356
with a devilish laugh.

45:27.358 --> 45:29.392
<i>The babysitter reports the call.</i>

45:29.394 --> 45:31.060
Hello, could you
get me the police.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.863
I've been getting
weird phone calls.

45:33.865 --> 45:35.932
<i> After a few minutes,</i>
<i>a hurried voice calls back.</i>

45:37.769 --> 45:37.767
Leave me alone!

45:37.769 --> 45:40.403
<i> Jill,</i>
<i>this is sergeant sachar.</i>

45:40.405 --> 45:42.338
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>We've traced the call.</i>

45:42.340 --> 45:44.307
The caller is in the house.

45:44.309 --> 45:46.876
<i>The calls are coming</i>
<i>from the house.</i>

45:46.878 --> 45:48.945
<i>It's coming from</i>
<i>inside the house.</i>

45:48.947 --> 45:51.280
<i> Just at that moment,</i>
<i>the babysitter looks over</i>

45:51.282 --> 45:53.850
<i>as a man is coming</i>
<i>down the stairs.</i>

45:59.156 --> 46:02.058
Well, that really happened
to a girl in my hometown.

46:02.060 --> 46:04.861
Oh, yes. I'm sure it did.

46:04.863 --> 46:07.730
I'm sure most of you grew up

46:07.732 --> 46:11.134
thinking that this happened
to girls in all your hometowns,

46:11.136 --> 46:13.669
but it didn't.

46:14.738 --> 46:17.206
<i> Yes, the babysitter</i>
<i>and the man upstairs</i>

46:17.208 --> 46:19.008
<i>is a popular urban legend,</i>

46:19.010 --> 46:21.444
<i>but is there any truth</i>
<i>behind it?</i>

46:21.446 --> 46:24.280
<i>One would think so</i>
<i>considering all these examples,</i>

46:24.282 --> 46:26.349
<i>but when dealing</i>
<i>with urban legends,</i>

46:26.351 --> 46:28.985
<i>the truth is never</i>
<i>quite what it seems.</i>

46:32.352 --> 46:34.391
<i>When I think babysitter,</i>

46:34.392 --> 46:37.493
<i>I think about me babysitting</i>
<i>as a teenager</i>

46:37.495 --> 46:39.929
and how fearful I was.

46:39.931 --> 46:42.498
You know,
being in a strange house,

46:42.500 --> 46:45.968
hearing strange sounds,
not being familiar,

46:45.970 --> 46:47.203
but what was interesting

46:47.205 --> 46:49.405
is that I started researching
babysitters,

46:49.407 --> 46:51.374
thinking that I wouldn't
have a hard time

46:51.376 --> 46:53.042
finding a case of a babysitter

46:53.044 --> 46:56.546
<i>by following some kind of</i>
<i>death or kidnapping,</i>

46:56.548 --> 47:00.116
the children upstairs
being killed or whatever.

47:00.118 --> 47:02.885
It's very difficult to find
any true crimes

47:02.887 --> 47:04.287
to connect
this urban legend line.

47:04.289 --> 47:04.287
<i>One thing that's interesting</i>

47:04.289 --> 47:09.158
<i>about babysitting is that it</i>
<i>doesn't increase your danger</i>

47:09.160 --> 47:10.993
of being attacked at all.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.396
<i>It would be</i>
<i>a completely random event</i>

47:13.398 --> 47:17.867
<i>for a babysitter to be attacked</i>
<i>during a house burglary,</i>

47:17.869 --> 47:21.270
<i>but it induces anxiety</i>
<i>because suddenly</i>

47:21.272 --> 47:23.840
they're responsible for
these other people's kids,

47:23.842 --> 47:25.441
<i>and it has nothing to do</i>
<i>with your potential</i>

47:25.443 --> 47:27.009
<i>for becoming a crime victim...</i>

47:27.011 --> 47:29.545
<i>but it may be getting it</i>
<i>expressed in stories</i>

47:29.547 --> 47:31.914
<i>in which the babysitter</i>
<i>becomes the crime victim.</i>

47:31.916 --> 47:33.549
<i> You would think</i>
<i>with the amount of babysitters</i>

47:33.551 --> 47:35.418
getting killed
in popular culture now,

47:35.420 --> 47:37.954
like, we would have just like
gotten a case immediately.

47:37.956 --> 47:39.555
Oh, it took me
to going back to the '50s

47:39.557 --> 47:41.424
to actually find one.

47:41.426 --> 47:44.026
We found this case
of janett christman

47:44.028 --> 47:47.496
here in Columbia, Missouri,
which is why we're here.

47:55.005 --> 47:58.407
<i>My name is Carol Haley holt,</i>

47:58.409 --> 48:03.079
and I was a very good friend
of janett christman

48:03.081 --> 48:08.117
from first grade
through the time of her death.

48:09.553 --> 48:14.023
<i>It was march 18, 1950.</i>

48:14.025 --> 48:18.294
Janett was babysitting
for the romack family

48:18.296 --> 48:20.897
out kind of in the west edge
of Columbia...

48:20.899 --> 48:23.599
it really wasn't
in the city limits.

48:23.601 --> 48:26.502
<i>It was kind of an eerie night.</i>

48:26.504 --> 48:30.907
<i>I also was babysitting,</i>
<i>and I just felt uneasy,</i>

48:30.909 --> 48:32.375
<i>and that was unusual for me</i>

48:32.377 --> 48:34.577
<i>because I did</i>
<i>quite a bit of babysitting...</i>

48:34.579 --> 48:39.148
but I just felt that something
was going on about 12 o'clock,

48:39.150 --> 48:41.217
and I even got up
to check the door

48:41.219 --> 48:42.318
and make sure it was locked,

48:42.320 --> 48:43.552
went in to check
the little boy...

48:43.554 --> 48:45.554
he was fine.

48:45.556 --> 48:48.958
And then the next morning,
the phone rang.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.160
My mother went in to answer

48:51.162 --> 48:53.029
<i>and told me that janett</i>
<i>had been killed</i>

48:53.031 --> 48:54.397
<i>while she was babysitting.</i>

48:54.598 --> 48:55.598
<i>I had heard that</i>

48:55.600 --> 48:59.368
there had been a phone call
to the police.

48:59.370 --> 49:02.038
Well, Mrs. romack tried to call

49:02.040 --> 49:06.208
to check on janett
with the thunder,

49:06.210 --> 49:08.945
and she was afraid
the little boy might wake up...

49:08.947 --> 49:12.214
and she tried to call
and received a busy signal.

49:13.584 --> 49:15.318
<i> What the romack</i>
<i>family didn't know</i>

49:15.320 --> 49:17.019
<i>is that janett</i>
<i>had called the police</i>

49:17.021 --> 49:18.454
<i>while she was being attacked,</i>

49:18.456 --> 49:22.091
<i>but the only thing they heard</i>
<i>were desperate screams.</i>

49:22.093 --> 49:23.426
<i>Unable to trace the call,</i>

49:23.428 --> 49:25.928
<i>the police were helpless</i>
<i>to stop her murder.</i>

49:28.632 --> 49:33.469
Janett had skin
under her fingernails.

49:36.139 --> 49:40.409
She had many abrasions
on her body,

49:40.411 --> 49:43.012
<i>but the final thing was</i>

49:43.014 --> 49:47.083
that she was strangled
with an ironing cord.

49:49.186 --> 49:54.023
I know she suffered a lot
before she finally succumbed.

49:56.360 --> 49:57.426
<i>Janett christman's death</i>

49:57.428 --> 50:00.162
<i>shocked the small town</i>
<i>of Columbia, Missouri,</i>

50:00.164 --> 50:02.231
<i>but despite being one of</i>
<i>the most publicized crimes</i>

50:02.233 --> 50:03.733
<i>in the past 60 years,</i>

50:03.735 --> 50:06.535
<i>her murder</i>
<i>has never been solved.</i>

50:06.537 --> 50:09.739
So right now, we're looking
for ed romack's house

50:09.741 --> 50:11.974
where janett christman
was murdered

50:11.976 --> 50:14.243
while she was babysitting.

50:14.245 --> 50:16.645
1015 should be
somewhere along here.

50:16.647 --> 50:18.447
<i>So then it must be that one.</i>

50:18.449 --> 50:20.449
<i>That house right there?</i>
<i>Right there, right there.</i>

50:22.252 --> 50:23.986
<i>Quick question for you,</i>

50:23.988 --> 50:26.455
<i>is this where ed romack</i>
<i>used to live?</i>

50:26.457 --> 50:27.523
<i>Is that this house?</i>

50:27.525 --> 50:27.523
<i>Maybe.</i>

50:27.525 --> 50:30.159
<i> But you don't know</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>

50:34.164 --> 50:35.564
Uh-hm.

50:35.566 --> 50:38.734
About two years ago,
this car pulled up

50:38.736 --> 50:42.738
and they were out there talking
and pointing here at this house,

50:42.740 --> 50:45.241
and they said
we're trying to figure out

50:45.243 --> 50:49.512
which house where a girl
was babysitting a little baby,

50:49.514 --> 50:51.514
and she got murdered and raped.

50:51.516 --> 50:51.514
<i>Uh-hm.</i>

50:51.516 --> 50:53.616
And I said, no,
it's not this house,

50:53.618 --> 50:54.717
it's that one.

50:54.719 --> 50:54.717
<i>Uh-hm.</i>

50:54.719 --> 50:58.421
It was a man talking to me.
He said, "I was the baby."

50:58.423 --> 50:59.588
<i>No!</i>

50:59.590 --> 50:59.588
<i>Wow!</i>

50:59.590 --> 51:03.225
And a different woman that
lived across west boulevard,

51:03.227 --> 51:05.594
and she had been
raped and murdered

51:05.596 --> 51:08.597
sometime within close
to that time.

51:08.599 --> 51:10.032
<i> Jenkins is it?</i>
Yes.

51:10.034 --> 51:11.167
<i>Jenkins, right.</i>

51:11.169 --> 51:13.202
We went to...
I went to the trial. Yeah.

51:13.204 --> 51:15.337
<i> Marylou Jenkins</i>
<i>was the other reason</i>

51:15.339 --> 51:17.206
<i>we were in Columbia.</i>

51:17.208 --> 51:21.310
<i>On February 6, 1946,</i>
<i>marylou, age 20,</i>

51:21.312 --> 51:22.611
<i>was home alone</i>
<i>while her mother was out</i>

51:22.613 --> 51:25.314
<i>caring for an elderly neighbor.</i>

51:25.316 --> 51:27.716
<i>The next morning she came home</i>
<i>to find marylou dead.</i>

51:27.718 --> 51:30.352
<i>Much like janett christman's</i>
<i>murder four years later,</i>

51:30.354 --> 51:31.787
<i>marylou had been raped</i>
<i>and strangled</i>

51:31.789 --> 51:33.589
<i>with an electrical cord.</i>

51:35.292 --> 51:37.626
<i>A mentally-challenged man</i>
<i>named Floyd Cochran</i>

51:37.628 --> 51:39.728
<i>who had been arrested</i>
<i>for killing his wife</i>

51:39.730 --> 51:42.798
<i>was charged with the murder</i>
<i>and quickly executed.</i>

51:42.800 --> 51:45.067
<i>Do you think Floyd was innocent?</i>

51:45.069 --> 51:47.203
I think
he was likely innocent

51:47.205 --> 51:49.672
of killing marylou Jenkins, yes.

51:49.674 --> 51:54.110
He did kill his wife
in likely a domestic dispute,

51:54.112 --> 51:56.745
but just from reading
the trial transcripts,

51:56.747 --> 51:58.781
it just didn't seem like
he had the wherewithal

51:58.783 --> 52:02.084
to kill and rape a young woman.

52:02.086 --> 52:04.286
Mary Beth brown
is a researcher

52:04.288 --> 52:07.089
who helped shed new light
on these old cold cases.

52:07.091 --> 52:08.757
<i>She believes</i>
<i>the eerie similarities</i>

52:08.759 --> 52:11.327
<i>between the Jenkins murder</i>
<i>and the christman murder</i>

52:11.329 --> 52:14.763
<i>four years later</i>
<i>only proves</i>
<i>Cochran's innocence.</i>

52:14.765 --> 52:17.666
They were both young woman,
they were home by themselves,

52:17.668 --> 52:20.302
they were both found
with electrical cords

52:20.304 --> 52:20.302
wrapped around their neck,

52:20.304 --> 52:25.841
but cords that weren't attached
or torn from the appliance...

52:25.843 --> 52:25.841
they were actually cut.

52:25.843 --> 52:30.346
The whole location thing
is the one that really gets me.

52:30.348 --> 52:31.614
<i>Like how close was it?</i>

52:31.616 --> 52:33.182
<i>Within two blocks.</i>

52:33.184 --> 52:35.317
<i> Do you think</i>
<i>that the same person</i>

52:35.319 --> 52:40.356
who killed marylou Jenkins
also killed janett christman?

52:40.358 --> 52:43.893
That's my personal opinion,
but yeah.

52:43.895 --> 52:45.494
<i>And who do you think did it?</i>

52:45.496 --> 52:46.896
I've been told several people,

52:46.898 --> 52:50.466
but more than any other name
was Robert Mueller.

52:50.468 --> 52:50.466
<i>Robert Mueller</i>

52:50.468 --> 52:53.802
<i>was a high school friend</i>
<i>of ed romack's,</i>

52:53.804 --> 52:55.471
<i>and it was the romack's house</i>

52:55.473 --> 52:57.540
<i>where janett was babysitting</i>
<i>that night.</i>

52:57.542 --> 52:59.375
<i>The romacks told police</i>
<i>that Mueller</i>

52:59.377 --> 53:01.810
<i>had often commented</i>
<i>on janett being a virgin</i>

53:01.812 --> 53:05.614
<i>and had eluded to knowing</i>
<i>intimate details of the crime.</i>

53:05.616 --> 53:07.616
<i>Although Mueller had been</i>
<i>taken in for questioning</i>

53:07.618 --> 53:10.219
<i>and passed a polygraph,</i>
<i>the police still felt</i>

53:10.221 --> 53:12.454
<i>there was enough evidence</i>
<i>to arrest him.</i>

53:12.456 --> 53:14.857
<i>However, a grand jury</i>
<i>refused to indict,</i>

53:14.859 --> 53:17.826
<i>and Mueller was never tried</i>
<i>for janett's murder.</i>

53:19.329 --> 53:21.830
<i> I am working</i>
<i>on a documentary,</i>

53:21.832 --> 53:23.766
and I'm interested
in a cold case

53:23.768 --> 53:23.766
that I've been researching.

53:23.768 --> 53:26.402
I wanted to see
if there was any information

53:26.404 --> 53:28.504
that you could give me.

53:28.506 --> 53:28.504
Okay, is that...

53:28.506 --> 53:31.407
did you just like
do something on your system

53:31.409 --> 53:33.309
and you see
there's nothing there?

53:33.311 --> 53:34.476
<i>Despite numerous efforts</i>

53:34.478 --> 53:35.711
<i>to reach out to police,</i>

53:35.713 --> 53:37.980
<i>they were less than responsive.</i>

53:37.982 --> 53:40.849
<i>Christman's case was too old</i>
<i>to warrant attention.</i>

53:40.851 --> 53:44.353
<i>However, we were able to</i>
<i>track down some old case files.</i>

53:44.355 --> 53:47.256
This deputy testified
that romack told him

53:47.258 --> 53:49.892
Mueller had known janett

53:49.894 --> 53:53.762
and admired
her well-developed form.

53:53.764 --> 53:56.865
<i>Oh my God!</i>

53:58.368 --> 54:00.302
<i>There's her leg.</i>

54:00.304 --> 54:02.771
<i>There's the phone.</i>

54:02.773 --> 54:06.842
That's the cord
around her neck, right there.

54:06.844 --> 54:11.413
<i>It's one of those irons</i>
<i>back then with the thick cords.</i>

54:11.415 --> 54:11.413
<i>That's the window</i>
<i>that was broken</i>

54:11.415 --> 54:15.451
<i>that supposedly</i>
<i>whoever did this</i>
<i>went in and out of,</i>

54:15.453 --> 54:15.451
<i>but the venetian blinds...</i>

54:15.453 --> 54:17.920
<i>if someone were going</i>
<i>through there...</i>

54:17.922 --> 54:19.822
<i>they'd be totally ripped up.</i>

54:19.824 --> 54:21.390
The piano, look.

54:21.392 --> 54:23.525
That's the window...
oh, look.

54:23.527 --> 54:23.525
<i>That's the broken glass</i>

54:23.527 --> 54:23.525
<i>and that's why they're saying</i>
<i>nothing is disturbed</i>

54:23.527 --> 54:28.797
<i>because look at the area</i>
<i>around it.</i>

54:28.799 --> 54:30.499
So, inside job.

54:30.501 --> 54:30.499
Uh-hm.

54:30.501 --> 54:33.402
Mueller's wife,
according to the deputy,

54:33.404 --> 54:37.239
had called the girl to baby sit
at the Mueller home that night

54:37.241 --> 54:39.675
and found she had already
been asked by Mrs. romack.

54:39.677 --> 54:40.976
<i>So, Mueller tried to get her</i>

54:40.978 --> 54:41.978
<i>to baby sit that night.</i>

54:41.979 --> 54:43.445
Must have been.

54:43.447 --> 54:46.615
And she was already
babysitting the romacks...

54:49.419 --> 54:51.754
which was how he would know
she would be alone.

54:51.756 --> 54:53.322
I agree that it sounds
like he did it,

54:53.324 --> 54:57.293
but maybe, maybe he didn't.

54:57.295 --> 55:00.529
There's no solid proof,
no hard evidence.

55:02.299 --> 55:05.501
<i> Joan sorrels is another</i>
<i>researcher studying the cases.</i>

55:05.503 --> 55:05.501
<i>She believes other crimes</i>

55:05.503 --> 55:08.304
<i>happening in Columbia</i>
<i>at the time</i>

55:08.306 --> 55:10.906
<i>might be connected</i>
<i>to these murders.</i>

55:10.908 --> 55:12.041
There were rapes

55:12.043 --> 55:15.344
that had occurred
within that period

55:15.346 --> 55:18.814
between the Jenkins murder
and the christman murder.

55:18.816 --> 55:19.816
Tell me about those.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.517
Yeah. Well, there was a rape

55:21.519 --> 55:25.654
that was within two blocks
of the christman murder.

55:25.656 --> 55:29.792
The girl was raped by a man
that wore a mask...

55:29.794 --> 55:30.794
Really?

55:30.795 --> 55:30.793
And when you read the stories...

55:30.795 --> 55:33.929
the reports
of the christman murder...

55:33.931 --> 55:35.864
when they're talking
about Robert Mueller,

55:35.866 --> 55:39.368
<i>it turns out that he was</i>
<i>interested in the theater</i>

55:39.370 --> 55:42.371
<i>and that he made masks.</i>

55:42.373 --> 55:46.041
There was a black man named
Jake Bradford that they charged,

55:46.043 --> 55:48.077
and he had already been in jail,

55:48.079 --> 55:51.647
and he was charged on the rapes.

55:51.649 --> 55:53.649
You assume he was innocent.

55:53.651 --> 55:55.050
Of that.

55:55.052 --> 55:58.520
They took the wrong man,
they really did.

55:58.522 --> 56:00.789
Would you say that Columbia
has like a history of this?

56:00.791 --> 56:02.558
Well, you remember
that I was graduating

56:02.560 --> 56:04.526
from high school in '51.

56:04.528 --> 56:06.395
You would go
to the mu football games

56:06.397 --> 56:07.996
and you would stand up
for Dixie.

56:07.998 --> 56:10.099
What does that mean?

56:10.101 --> 56:11.567
The song <i> dixies</i>...

56:11.569 --> 56:12.801
Uh-hm, okay.

56:12.803 --> 56:14.470
That's a confederate song.

56:14.472 --> 56:14.470
Uh-hm.

56:14.472 --> 56:20.342
Columbia was really primarily
a confederate town.

56:22.479 --> 56:24.780
Basically this is the story
of a young girl...

56:24.782 --> 56:25.781
<i>We came here to investigate</i>

56:25.783 --> 56:25.781
<i>an urban legend,</i>

56:25.783 --> 56:29.017
<i>but what we found</i>
<i>was truly shocking...</i>

56:29.019 --> 56:31.353
<i>the unsolved murders</i>
<i>of two young girls,</i>

56:31.355 --> 56:33.889
<i>a series of brutal rapes,</i>
<i>and the possibility</i>

56:33.891 --> 56:38.460
<i>that men were being falsely</i>
<i>accused and even executed.</i>

56:38.462 --> 56:41.630
<i>In all honesty, the truth</i>
<i>was more unflinchingly real</i>

56:41.632 --> 56:43.665
<i>than we could ever</i>
<i>have imagined.</i>

56:43.667 --> 56:46.802
<i>So right now, we are headed</i>
<i>to hinkson creek.</i>

56:46.804 --> 56:48.837
This is where
a lot of people went to park

56:48.839 --> 56:52.541
back in the '50s, and '40s,
'50s, '60s and still do now.

56:52.543 --> 56:53.675
Yeah.

56:56.379 --> 56:57.780
We just wanted to see
about all the other rapes

56:57.782 --> 57:00.416
that were happening
other than the two houses.

57:00.418 --> 57:03.085
This is the creek
where they're saying

57:03.087 --> 57:05.854
there were a ton of rapes
happening around here.

57:11.394 --> 57:12.594
<i>That.</i>

57:14.097 --> 57:16.031
<i>This is where</i>
<i>the college students go in,</i>

57:16.033 --> 57:17.766
<i>and there's like a car</i>
<i>right out over there</i>

57:17.768 --> 57:19.067
<i>and they just flashed</i>
<i>their lights</i>

57:19.069 --> 57:22.738
because they didn't want us
to walk in on them.

57:25.542 --> 57:26.675
What's down here?

57:26.677 --> 57:28.844
Uh, where they dragged the girl.

57:28.846 --> 57:32.581
<i> Dragged?</i>
Dragged from the car.

57:32.583 --> 57:34.483
There was a couple making out.

57:34.485 --> 57:36.652
Some guy came out of nowhere

57:36.654 --> 57:39.087
and then at gunpoint
pulled one of the girls off

57:39.089 --> 57:42.057
into the woods... and it was
right near Halloween...

57:42.059 --> 57:45.894
and basically this guy
put a mask over his head

57:45.896 --> 57:49.465
<i>and then he put a mask</i>
<i>over the girl's face,</i>

57:49.467 --> 57:49.465
<i>and then he raped her.</i>

57:49.467 --> 57:52.968
I think the more scary thing
was being a woman,

57:52.970 --> 57:57.940
being a girl between
1940 and 1950, in this area,

57:57.942 --> 58:00.876
knowing the amount of things
going on.

58:00.878 --> 58:02.778
I wouldn't have wanted to be
a babysitter back then.

58:02.780 --> 58:05.080
I wouldn't have wanted
to be by myself

58:05.082 --> 58:05.080
in one of those houses.

58:05.082 --> 58:10.085
Most teenagers in the us
go through a period

58:10.087 --> 58:12.154
when they baby sit
at least once or twice,

58:12.156 --> 58:16.558
<i>and it feels very terrifying</i>
<i>to the person who is doing it,</i>

58:17.595 --> 58:20.128
<i>But it's not actually dangerous</i>
<i>almost at all.</i>

58:20.130 --> 58:22.531
<i>I mean, there's no reason</i>
<i>to imagine</i>

58:22.533 --> 58:25.067
<i>that any killer would even know</i>

58:25.069 --> 58:27.536
<i>that a babysitter was on duty</i>
<i>in the house,</i>

58:27.538 --> 58:29.972
<i>and it makes the most sense</i>
<i>if you think about the fact</i>

58:29.974 --> 58:33.075
<i>that maybe he knew she was</i>
<i>going to be there babysitting</i>

58:33.077 --> 58:35.210
and maybe
he did this specifically

58:35.212 --> 58:37.179
to torment the babysitter,

58:37.181 --> 58:39.114
and that is
exactly what happened,

58:39.116 --> 58:41.817
they think,
in the Columbia case.

58:41.819 --> 58:44.853
<i> Was somebody tormenting</i>
<i>the babysitters in Columbia...</i>

58:44.855 --> 58:47.723
<i>and was the same person</i>
<i>responsible for the sex crimes</i>

58:47.725 --> 58:49.658
<i>that had terrorized this town...</i>

58:49.660 --> 58:53.962
<i>and finally</i>
<i>was this same person</i>
<i>Robert Mueller?</i>

58:53.964 --> 58:55.764
<i>Hoping for some</i>
<i>additional insight,</i>

58:55.766 --> 58:58.233
<i>we turned to a profiler</i>
<i>in Kansas City,</i>

58:58.235 --> 59:00.969
<i>a former German national</i>
<i>named Peter brendt</i>

59:00.971 --> 59:03.005
<i>who was willing to review</i>
<i>our case.</i>

59:03.007 --> 59:06.842
<i>So in your opinion,</i>
<i>the same killer for both girls.</i>

59:06.844 --> 59:08.677
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>This is too specific</i>

59:08.679 --> 59:11.013
<i>if you add</i>
<i>all of the details together.</i>

59:11.015 --> 59:13.181
Do you think
that marylou Jenkins knew him?

59:13.183 --> 59:16.218
<i>Well, there was no sign</i>
<i>of forced entry on the door,</i>

59:16.220 --> 59:21.056
<i>so at least from the sight,</i>
<i>she must have known him,</i>

59:21.058 --> 59:23.825
<i>and he was non threatening</i>
<i>to her.</i>

59:23.827 --> 59:26.795
Right.
Now let's talk about christman.

59:26.797 --> 59:29.631
<i> Oh, well,</i>
<i>this is a lot more specifics</i>.

59:29.633 --> 59:32.000
<i>If you see</i>
<i>there comes an offender,</i>

59:32.002 --> 59:33.168
<i>he breaks a window.</i>

59:33.170 --> 59:35.771
<i>The victim runs to the kitchen</i>
<i>where the phone is,</i>

59:35.773 --> 59:38.073
<i>and he walks in</i>
<i>through the front door.</i>

59:38.075 --> 59:40.576
<i>Now, why would he do that?</i>

59:40.578 --> 59:43.579
<i>He would do that</i>
<i>only if he knew one detail...</i>

59:43.581 --> 59:48.684
<i>ed romack had shown her</i>
<i>how to use the shortcut.</i>

59:48.686 --> 59:50.686
<i> Peter had brought up</i>
<i>an interesting clue...</i>

59:50.688 --> 59:52.321
<i>one that many had overlooked.</i>

59:52.323 --> 59:54.089
<i>Romack testified</i>
<i>that he had shown janett</i>

59:54.091 --> 59:56.558
<i>a loaded shotgun</i>
<i>by the front door.</i>

59:56.560 --> 59:56.558
<i>By breaking the window,</i>

59:56.560 --> 59:59.828
<i>Mueller would distract her</i>
<i>away from the gun</i>

59:59.830 --> 01:00:03.298
<i>so he could safely</i>
<i>get inside the house.</i>

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.935
<i>He knew how long he would need</i>
<i>around the house,</i>

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.971
<i>through the front door</i>
<i>into the kitchen.</i>

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:13.942
<i>So he knew every feet</i>
<i>of the route.</i>

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.577
Do you think it was Mueller?

01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:17.012
<i>He fits the bill,</i>

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.981
<i>but a lot of other males</i>
<i>of the town</i>

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:20.849
<i>would fit that bill, too.</i>

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:24.119
<i>And the problem is</i>
<i>he passed his lie detector.</i>

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:30.158
<i>Now, if you have even 20%</i>
<i>to 40% cycle passes it makes...</i>

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.827
<i>a lie detector,</i>

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:34.830
<i>especially an old model</i>
<i>from the '50s,</i>

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:39.868
<i>um, well, it's worthless.</i>

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.868
Now the other interesting thing

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:44.873
is that the rapes and murders
stopped when he left town.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:48.210
<i>Well, that looks not good</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:53.248
<i>What was it, half a million</i>
<i>young males went to Korea?</i>

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.385
<i>So he wasn't the only one</i>
<i>who left the area.</i>

01:00:56.387 --> 01:00:59.021
<i>I mean he would</i>
<i>so nicely fit the bill,</i>

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:03.725
<i>but that's the risky part</i>
<i>with profiles, yeah?</i>

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:06.194
<i>A profile states</i>
<i>not who the killer is</i>

01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:08.864
<i>but what the killer is.</i>

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:09.865
<i>I think it's interesting</i>

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:12.100
<i>that he thinks whoever this is,</i>

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:15.671
he knew her...
he knew both.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.005
<i> Although we'll</i>
<i>never be able to prove</i>

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.874
<i>who committed all these crimes,</i>

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:20.308
<i>the evidence strongly suggests</i>

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:23.645
<i>that janett christman</i>
<i>knew her killer.</i>

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:28.383
There really is not
a strong tradition in America

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:32.854
of strangers coming in
and killing babysitters.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:36.992
<i>Babysitters killing</i>
<i>small children, yes,</i>

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:40.729
<i>but the stranger</i>
<i>on babysitter story</i>

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:47.736
just doesn't connect up with
a widespread real social fear.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.209
<i> What the babysitter</i>
<i>and the man upstairs</i>

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:57.145
<i>seems to be about</i>
<i>is this warning</i>

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.081
<i>about this kind of</i>
<i>responsibility.</i>

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.449
If you're taking
this responsibility,

01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:02.084
you have to take it seriously.

01:02:02.086 --> 01:02:04.786
So, you have this voice
that calls her up on the phone

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:06.421
and almost like a conscience,

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:08.290
asks have you checked
the children,

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:10.258
<i>and she hasn't</i>
<i>checked the children,</i>

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.828
<i>and that's one of the reasons</i>
<i>why she doesn't know</i>

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.763
<i>that they've been murdered.</i>

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.066
<i>I think it makes more sense</i>

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.102
<i>to look at it in a simple way</i>

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:25.273
and say the babysitter is
dealing with her own anxieties

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:29.978
of being potentially the cause
of the children's death...

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:34.349
and the killer upstairs
is the killer upstairs for her.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.318
The tragic case
of janett christman

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.987
<i>only goes to prove</i>
<i>bill Ellis's point</i>

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:42.791
<i>that our portrayal of the man</i>
<i>upstairs is incorrect...</i>

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:45.260
<i>and that's because the truth</i>
<i>is more terrifying</i>

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.229
<i>than we can ever imagine.</i>

01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:49.231
<i>Janett christman</i>
<i>knew her killer,</i>

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:51.767
<i>and if it's true</i>
<i>that her killer was Mueller</i>

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:54.402
<i>as so many in Columbia</i>
<i>have suggested,</i>

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:57.239
<i>then the man tormenting her</i>
<i>that fateful night</i>

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.474
<i>wasn't any stranger.</i>

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:15.190
<i>So now we go from</i>
<i>Columbia, Missouri,</i>

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:17.793
<i>to Chicago in the 1980s...</i>

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:19.995
<i>from the small town</i>
<i>to the big city.</i>

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:24.900
<i>For some,</i>
<i>it is a loss of innocence,</i>

01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:29.004
<i>and nothing speaks to that loss</i>
<i>more than clowns.</i>

01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:33.408
<i>We used to think of clowns</i>
<i>as fairly happy characters.</i>

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.844
<i>Yes, sometimes</i>
<i>they were sad or hapless,</i>

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:38.380
<i>but ultimately they were</i>
<i>harmless caricatures.</i>

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:41.983
<i>Of course, clown faces</i>
<i>were exaggerated and garish,</i>

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:43.451
<i>but that's because of</i>
<i>the far distances</i>

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:45.921
<i>between the audience</i>
<i>and the ring.</i>

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:49.357
<i>It wasn't the clown's fault,</i>
<i>or was it?</i>

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:52.427
<i>Before modern times,</i>
<i>the clown...</i>

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:54.429
<i>or more appropriately</i>
<i>the Jester...</i>

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.398
<i>was considered</i>
<i>a mischievous trickster</i>

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.135
<i>whose special role</i>
<i>allowed them to mock nobility.</i>

01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:03.371
<i>Jesters served to entertain,</i>
<i>but it wasn't all smiles.</i>

01:04:03.373 --> 01:04:08.276
<i>These clowns had a mean streak,</i>
<i>and they played it to the hilt.</i>

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:10.879
<i>But what was it</i>
<i>about the clowns of today</i>

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:14.883
<i>that turned them</i>
<i>into something evil?</i>

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:18.954
Breakfast.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.924
I'm hungry.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.560
<i> Some believe</i>
<i>it was when we brought clowns</i>

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:27.896
<i>out of the big top</i>
<i>and into our homes</i>

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:30.031
<i>via birthday parties and TV,</i>

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.868
<i>that things</i>
<i>really began to change.</i>

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:36.204
We see you here as bozo.
Who are you really?

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.306
<i> Had that</i>
<i>suspicious gleam in the eye</i>

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:39.975
<i>been there all along?</i>

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:42.911
<i>Did we finally just put</i>
<i>two and two together to realize</i>

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:46.414
<i>that clowns were creepy</i>
<i>or even worse...</i>

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.049
<i>dangerous?</i>

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.585
<i>The news at 5.</i>

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:52.420
<i>Chicago police warned parents</i>

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:56.524
<i>about a man dressed as a clown</i>
<i>who is approaching children.</i>

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.593
<i>Police say a clown</i>
<i>tried to lure boys</i>

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:01.863
<i>into his pickup truck</i>
<i>last Tuesday evening.</i>

01:05:01.865 --> 01:05:03.365
<i>Police have issued</i>
<i>two community alerts</i>

01:05:03.367 --> 01:05:06.868
<i>regarding the clown sighting</i>
<i>near some southside schools</i>

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:09.271
<i>as well as</i>
<i>some westside schools.</i>

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.006
<i>No one can say for sure</i>

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:15.510
<i>where in Chicago</i>
<i>it happened first or even when,</i>

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:21.583
<i>but they were out there,</i>
<i>snatching kids off the streets.</i>

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:24.352
<i>They trolled playgrounds</i>
<i>and schoolyards.</i>

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:26.421
<i>Sometimes they used</i>
<i>balloons or candy</i>

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.356
<i>to lure the gullible ones.</i>

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.327
<i>But ask anyone</i>
<i>who has seen them,</i>

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:34.896
<i>and they'll all tell you</i>
<i>the same thing...</i>

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:37.198
<i>it was the white van</i>
<i>they saw first</i>

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:41.903
<i>and then that face</i>
<i>behind the wheel</i>

01:05:41.905 --> 01:05:44.639
<i>painted white</i>
<i>with a maniacal smile.</i>

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:49.945
<i>We call them the killer clowns,</i>

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:52.447
<i>and they only wanted</i>
<i>one thing...</i>

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:56.484
<i>to kidnap kids just like us.</i>

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.020
<i> Police are saying</i>
<i>that the suspect</i>

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:01.189
<i>wears clown make-up, a wig,</i>

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:03.224
<i>and sometimes</i>
<i>he carried balloons.</i>

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:03.224
<i>The latest pair of incidents</i>

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:06.995
<i>occurred near playgrounds</i>
<i>at 83rd and mackinaw...</i>

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:08.697
They were running out
of the playground area.

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:11.232
To prey on children
at this time, you know,

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:13.568
right around the time
that they want to go out

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.438
and do trick-or-treating
is unfortunate.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.007
We should emphasize
that nothing has happened...

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:19.007
no child has been hurt...

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:23.111
but certainly these incidents
that have been near children

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.113
is making it very uneasy.

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:32.120
<i> In 2008, this was</i>
<i>one of the reported sightings...</i>

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:33.021
South mackinaw...

01:06:33.023 --> 01:06:35.991
one of the theoretical
clown abductions

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:38.593
where apparently he was hiding
in the playground

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.061
with some balloons...

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:42.063
Or he was in a van
or he was in a truck.

01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:44.065
<i>I mean, no adult</i>
<i>said they saw this.</i>

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:46.034
<i>Something was going on</i>
<i>with these children</i>

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:50.271
to feel the need
to alert adults.

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:51.373
You doing a documentary?

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:51.373
Yeah, we are.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.742
<i> Do you believe</i>
<i>that really happened?</i>

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:54.809
Yeah, oh sure.

01:06:54.811 --> 01:06:56.244
<i> Why do you believe</i>
<i>that happened?</i>

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.512
Well, people told me, you know,

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.414
that they actually seen that.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.216
Was it just one incident
or was it...

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:03.385
No, it was like a couple weeks
or you know,

01:07:03.387 --> 01:07:05.653
a month or something like
that it was going on.

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:07.055
<i>Did they ever catch the guy?</i>

01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:07.055
I'm not sure.

01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:09.657
I think they did
because it stopped.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.193
Definitely
it was a true incident.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.062
Uh-hm.
Uh-hm.

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:14.062
So, he believes...

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:17.298
He believes it.
It was-it was real.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.567
I think there could possibly
have been a clown here.

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:21.403
It's hard to discern.

01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:23.705
A white van
and the guy had a mask...

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.573
Uh-hm.
...Of a clown.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:27.709
One of our friends' daughters...

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:29.210
yeah, and she was holding on

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.645
like for dear life to the fence.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.180
<i> Really?</i>
Yeah.

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:33.782
<i> Do you believe</i>
<i>it really happened?</i>

01:07:33.784 --> 01:07:33.782
I believe so.

01:07:33.784 --> 01:07:37.052
We have tons and tons
of pedophiles

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:39.054
in this community.
I always log on to it.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:40.088
<i> Really?</i>
Oh yes.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.189
Dressing as a clown?

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:41.189
Yeah.

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:43.725
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:43.725
No.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:43.725
<i>But you never saw the clown.</i>

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:49.064
No, but we saw people
that acted like that person...

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:49.064
trying to lure...
tell the kids.

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:53.468
I saw him right in the store
and I warned the store owner.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.803
I'd like for people
to hear the truth

01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:57.072
Not a lie.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.141
Now I don't know what to think.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:02.177
<i> Walking away,</i>
<i>it was hard not to believe</i>

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:04.412
that there must be
some truth to this.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.548
Could all these people
really be wrong?

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:10.118
Maybe our fear of clowns
isn't just in our heads.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.389
<i> Coulrophobia</i>
<i>is the fear of clowns.</i>

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:16.658
It is so widespread now
that, you know,

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:19.828
everybody knows that people
are afraid of clowns.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:22.564
Everybody knows that something
is up with clowns,

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:25.533
<i>and the last couple of decades</i>
<i>have just been confirmation</i>

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:27.301
<i>of everything they ever feared.</i>

01:08:27.304 --> 01:08:27.301
<i>But what's even more disturbing</i>

01:08:27.304 --> 01:08:32.740
<i>is that these phantom clowns</i>
<i>didn't just appear in 2008.</i>

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:35.577
<i>There was a similar sighting</i>
<i>17 years previously,</i>

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:38.613
<i>in the fall of 1991.</i>

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.615
<i>From the number of</i>
<i>alleged sightings</i>

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.118
<i>coming from practically</i>
<i>all over Chicago,</i>

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.486
<i>police are theorizing</i>

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.654
there may be more
than one phony clown

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:48.790
out roaming the streets.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:49.858
<i>This is a comment.</i>

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.725
<i>"I've seen the same van</i>
<i>with the clown driving</i>

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:54.295
<i>when we was on the westside</i>
<i>playing,</i>

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.464
<i>and I can recall the van</i>
<i>stopping in the alley</i>

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.765
<i>and the clown trying to</i>
<i>lure me to the van.</i>

01:08:58.768 --> 01:08:58.765
<i>That scared me worser</i>

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:02.537
than living in cabrini-green
projects."

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:05.340
<i> The mention of</i>
<i>cabrini-green was telling.</i>

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:08.475
<i>It had been one of Chicago's</i>
<i>most notorious slums</i>

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:12.680
<i>where kids faced</i>
<i>rampant poverty and</i>
<i>violence on a daily basis.</i>

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:13.848
<i>But how does a kid process</i>

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:15.649
<i>these overwhelming</i>
<i>societal issues</i>

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:18.319
<i>that are just too big to fix?</i>

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:19.821
Have you ever like
heard of any talk

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.689
about any scary place
on your block,

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:23.124
<i>a place nobody went to?</i>

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:25.560
Every block is a scary block...

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:27.495
So much shooting
and killing out here.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.197
You guys think clowns are scary?

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.231
Clowns?
Yeah.

01:09:30.233 --> 01:09:31.866
No.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:32.868
<i>Killer clowns.</i>

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.169
Killer clowns.

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:39.207
We've got a real shot here,
Bernadette.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:40.875
An entire community
starts attributing

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:44.645
the daily horrors of their lives
to a mythical figure.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.848
<i>Sometimes we create monsters.</i>

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.151
<i>Sometimes we just need</i>
<i>to put a face on our fear.</i>

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.854
Aren't you going to say hello?

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.758
This is where there was

01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.529
another series of
clown sightings back in '91.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.898
<i>They called this clown sighting</i>
<i>the homey the clown sighting.</i>

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.100
<i>Back in the early '90s,</i>

01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:07.602
<i>there was a popular show on,</i>
<i>in living colors.</i>

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.904
Huge character on there,
homey the clown.

01:10:09.906 --> 01:10:12.407
Now let's show them
how homey gets back at

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:13.575
Mr. establishment.

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:16.444
Sure.

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:23.451
I mean, this is only one
of many, many places

01:10:23.453 --> 01:10:25.687
all over Chicago.

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:28.356
<i>There was a real citywide scare.</i>

01:10:28.358 --> 01:10:30.491
<i>The Chicago police</i>
<i>were being called.</i>

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:32.760
<i>There were reports in the news.</i>

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.696
<i> Isaiah Thompson</i>
<i>was a local reporter</i>

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:37.465
<i>who grew up in Chicago</i>
<i>and wrote about the clowns</i>

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:39.467
<i>that seemed to be lurking</i>
<i>on every corner.</i>

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:42.237
<i>Somehow-you know,</i>

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:44.472
<i>I don't know that anyone</i>
<i>knows how, you know,</i>

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:47.375
<i>this whole city,</i>
<i>especially like this whole</i>

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:50.211
<i>public school network of</i>
<i>thousands and thousands of kids</i>

01:10:50.213 --> 01:10:51.679
<i>all believe the same thing,</i>

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:54.482
<i>so it seems like</i>
<i>this larger force of nature</i>

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:57.986
<i>that sort of visited itself</i>
<i>upon the kids of Chicago.</i>

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:00.355
<i> What the kids in 1991</i>
<i>didn't know</i>

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:04.926
<i>was that Chicago had</i>
<i>an even earlier clown scare.</i>

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:10.898
There was another clown scare
phenomenon previously in 1981.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.435
It's been said that that one
started in Boston.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.237
Uh-hm. You think '81,
you think '80s,

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:19.741
you think Steven king,
you think <i> poltergeist.</i>

01:11:19.743 --> 01:11:23.411
No, that started in '82,
<i>poltergeist,</i> '86 for <i> it.</i>

01:11:23.413 --> 01:11:25.413
This was all before any of that.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:27.016
<i> It's easy to see</i>
<i>how poltergeist</i>

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:29.517
<i>could have helped</i>
<i>spread a clown scare.</i>

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.261
<i>And of course,</i>
<i>Steven king's it...</i>

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:43.298
Ah-ha, I'll drive you crazy
and I'll kill you all.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.266
I'm every nightmare
you ever had.

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:48.670
I am your worst dream come true!

01:11:48.672 --> 01:11:50.371
<i> But the fact</i>
<i>that the 1981 scare</i>

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:53.708
<i>preceded these cinematic</i>
<i>killer clowns was telling.</i>

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:56.010
<i>This wasn't just kids</i>
<i>watching some movie,</i>

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:58.713
<i>not when this fear</i>
<i>was everywhere.</i>

01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:02.784
<i> Clowns appear</i>
<i>in California in 1967;</i>

01:12:02.786 --> 01:12:04.385
<i>in Newark 1980;</i>

01:12:04.387 --> 01:12:05.520
<i>Boston; Providence;</i>

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:08.389
<i>Omaha; Phoenix,</i>
<i>Arizona in 1985;</i>

01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:09.490
<i>Chicago; Galveston,</i>

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.825
<i>Texas, 1992;</i>

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:11.893
<i>Washington; Maryland;</i>

01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:13.394
<i>Scotland, 1991;</i>

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:15.897
throughout a large portion
of Latin America

01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:19.500
from Mexico to South America
in the mid-90s.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.602
<i>The question of</i>
<i>how it's being spread</i>

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:24.772
is a very interesting one
because you have an age group

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:27.942
which doesn't have
an enormous amount of contacts

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:30.511
<i>and especially</i>
<i>in a pre-Internet time.</i>

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:33.414
Elementary schools
communicating with students

01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:36.517
in other elementary schools
on the other side of town

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:36.517
is very unlikely.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:41.089
How it's transmitted is really
one of the most intriguing,

01:12:41.091 --> 01:12:44.459
perhaps unsolved mysteries
about it.

01:12:47.792 --> 01:12:49.531
<i>All over the world,</i>

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:52.533
<i>kids were seeing killer clowns,</i>

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.335
<i>but it could have been</i>
<i>any monster...</i>

01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:58.806
<i>zombies, vampires, witches,</i>
<i>why clowns?</i>

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:01.676
<i>Maybe our fear points</i>
<i>to an even larger issue.</i>

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:03.778
<i>Maybe it was the clown's</i>
<i>loss of innocence</i>

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.114
<i>that made them</i>
<i>that much more scary</i>

01:13:06.116 --> 01:13:08.516
<i>because it spoke</i>
<i>to our own loss.</i>

01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:11.686
<i>For those born</i>
<i>into a generation</i>
<i>of stranger danger,</i>

01:13:11.688 --> 01:13:14.389
<i>where missing kids appeared</i>
<i>on every milk carton,</i>

01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:16.391
<i>clowns represented a world</i>

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:18.526
<i>that had turned</i>
<i>almost evil overnight,</i>

01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:20.795
<i>and that's because</i>
<i>it's here in Chicago</i>

01:13:20.797 --> 01:13:22.697
<i>where the notion</i>
<i>of killer clowns</i>

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:24.365
<i>became a reality.</i>

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:25.967
<i> Police found</i>
<i>the decomposed remains</i>

01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:27.168
<i>of three bodies.</i>

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.804
<i>They suspect there are several</i>
<i>more bodies buried here.</i>

01:13:29.806 --> 01:13:32.807
<i> And the most</i>
<i>evil of them all was pogo,</i>

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:36.411
<i>the alter ego of one of the</i>
<i>most prolific serial killers</i>

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:40.481
<i>in all of history,</i>
<i>John Wayne gacy.</i>

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.453
<i>Gacy was a sadistic</i>
<i>serial killer</i>

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:47.388
<i>who brutally slayed 33 young men</i>

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:52.026
<i>between 1972 and 1978</i>
<i>in the Chicago suburbs.</i>

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:55.797
<i>Though many have portrayed</i>
<i>gacy as an actual killer clown,</i>

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:57.832
<i>the truth behind</i>
<i>his demented persona</i>

01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:59.634
<i>is not so simple.</i>

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.117
<i>How many bodies</i>
<i>did you find here?</i>

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:19.053
<i> Twenty-nine,</i>
<i>twenty-seven under the house...</i>

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:19.053
Uh-hm.

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:21.989
In the crawlspace,
one under the driveway...

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:26.461
And one under an extension
that he put on the garage.

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:26.461
<i>This is Bob egans</i>,

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:29.864
<i>a former prosecutor</i>
<i>on the gacy case,</i>

01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:32.433
<i>and cook county detective</i>
<i>Jason moran.</i>

01:14:32.435 --> 01:14:34.902
<i> When we first saw</i>
<i>the pogo the clown pictures,</i>

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:34.902
<i>we went, oh my God,</i>

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:38.139
<i>is this guy acting as a clown</i>
<i>to get victims...</i>

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:41.542
that's what we thought,
but it wasn't that at all.

01:14:41.544 --> 01:14:44.178
He was doing that because
he was the center of attention,

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:44.178
and everything he did

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.114
was to make himself
the center of attention.

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:49.083
I still don't like clowns.

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:51.819
And I'm an adult
with a gun and a badge.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:53.754
And it might be
from being a child

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:57.725
during that time because
if you look at pogo the clown,

01:14:57.727 --> 01:14:59.660
he was a very creepy clown.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:02.530
If you look at the pictures,
the make-up around his eyes

01:15:02.532 --> 01:15:05.199
when he was portraying pogo,
was triangular,

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:08.736
and the make-up around his mouth
came up to points.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:11.105
<i>Clown experts said</i>
<i>clowns do not have</i>

01:15:11.107 --> 01:15:13.508
<i>any sharp points on their faces.</i>

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:14.809
Why?

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:17.645
Because it scares kids
and it connotes evil.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:20.114
And so do you think
gacy did this on purpose

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:21.682
to connote evil?

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:22.783
It was subconscious?
No, I don't think at all.

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:24.018
I think it was
purely coincidental.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:24.018
He wasn't...

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:24.018
I don't think he was
thinking of that for one second.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.890
<i>I'm telling you, that's exactly</i>
<i>what we believed at the time.</i>

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.526
Pogo the clown issue
was the subject

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:34.061
of a lot of conversation
during the trial prep.

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:38.666
<i> Although gacy never did</i>
<i>kill anyone dressed as a clown,</i>

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:41.969
<i>he did tell police clowns</i>
<i>could get away with murder,</i>

01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:44.739
<i>leading many to believe</i>
<i>his signature clown look</i>

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:48.976
<i>was in fact a true reflection</i>
<i>of his inner evil self.</i>

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:54.882
<i>Ken melvoin-berg</i>
<i>is a noted historian</i>

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:58.619
<i>who understands</i>
<i>the dark side of a clown.</i>

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:00.821
It doesn't matter the type
of mask that you're putting on...

01:16:00.823 --> 01:16:02.056
whether it's a clown face...

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.925
it's to hide who you are
a little bit

01:16:03.927 --> 01:16:05.860
and to be somebody
a little bit different.

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:08.696
It's oftentimes the opposite
of what we portray ourselves

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:08.696
in our day-to-day lives.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:12.800
So somebody who is
a truly evil person like gacy

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:17.138
puts it on
to sort of offset that.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.106
<i> What happens</i>
<i>when people costume</i>

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:23.077
<i>is that they're playing with</i>
<i>these internal personalities...</i>

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:26.814
<i>they're repressing</i>
<i>the normal ego...</i>

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.984
and they are allowing
some internal personality

01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:32.153
to become dominant.

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:34.288
And so you put on
the clown make-up

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:37.558
and you are no longer yourself.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.963
<i>You then become someone</i>
<i>that is unpredictable,</i>

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:45.866
possibly dangerous,
possibly violent.

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:48.302
Game on, my friend.

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:54.108
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:55.843
<i>Clowns have always been</i>

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:58.079
<i>a huge thing for us</i>
<i>here in Chicago</i>

01:16:58.081 --> 01:17:00.181
unlike any other American city

01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:03.250
where we have clowns
and clown stories

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:05.920
and clown mythology
and clown history

01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:09.023
that no other city
in the us has.

01:17:09.025 --> 01:17:12.293
<i>It started off a long time ago</i>
<i>in the 1890s</i>

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.996
<i>when the columbian exposition</i>
<i>brought clowns around</i>

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:17.365
<i>just to entertain folks.</i>

01:17:17.367 --> 01:17:19.033
<i>Going forward in time</i>
<i>a little bit,</i>

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:20.935
up into the 1950s, like Bob bell

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:22.937
who was the original
bozo the clown.

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:25.840
<i>The bozo set is still at wgn</i>
<i>in the building,</i>

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:27.274
<i>and it's allegedly haunted.</i>

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:29.644
In the late '70s is when
you had John Wayne gacy.

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:31.345
<i>Shortly after is when</i>

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:31.345
<i>a clown panic happened.</i>

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:34.915
So for people like me
who are a little bit sadistic,

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:36.884
to me it's made it
that much more interesting

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:38.352
because people
are that much more scared

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:39.987
of clowns these days.

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:42.390
The thing is
that all of the people

01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:46.761
that were children
in the 1980s and 1990s

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:46.761
are adults now,

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:49.830
and are telling these
terrifying tales of clowns

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.232
to their children.

01:17:51.234 --> 01:17:54.001
Speaking of the connection
to clowns in Chicago,

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.370
the one site that you guys
have got to see

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:59.407
if you haven't been there before
is showmen's rest

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:04.145
which is a monument
to the circus and clowns

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:06.180
in a cemetery.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:07.181
<i>Buried in Chicago</i>

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:10.284
<i>were the clowns</i>
<i>and other circus performers</i>

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:12.153
<i>who died in one of the worst</i>
<i>train wrecks</i>

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:13.721
<i>in American history.</i>

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:15.656
<i>On June 22, 1918,</i>

01:18:15.658 --> 01:18:17.958
<i>after its conductor fell asleep,</i>

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.061
<i>a train plowed</i>
<i>into the idle sleeper cars</i>

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:22.863
<i>of the</i>
<i>hagenbeck-Wallace</i>
<i>circus.</i>

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:25.032
<i>Those who weren't killed</i>
<i>in the initial impact</i>

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:28.669
<i>burned to death after</i>
<i>the wooden cars caught on fire.</i>

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:32.740
<i>In all, 86 performers</i>
<i>were killed.</i>

01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:35.009
<i>With so many burned</i>
<i>beyond recognition,</i>

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:36.811
<i>they were buried in a mass grave</i>

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:39.080
<i>in a section</i>
<i>of the Chicago cemetery</i>

01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:41.716
<i>called showmen's rest.</i>

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:43.951
<i>One of those who survived</i>
<i>was Joe coyle,</i>

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:45.286
<i>a famously jovial clown</i>

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:48.089
<i>whose act became</i>
<i>perpetually sad and morose</i>

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:50.791
<i>as he took to dressing in rags.</i>

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:54.428
<i>Coyle would play a sad clown</i>
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.198
<i>Joe coyle spoke bitterly</i>

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.733
<i>as he lay on a stretcher</i>

01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:00.468
<i>and told how his wife</i>
<i>and two babies</i>

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:03.337
had joined him only recently
and how all three

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.940
had been crushed to death
at his very side.

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:09.009
"The kiddies had been so glad
to see their daddy," he said,

01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:11.812
"I wish I could have died
with them."

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:26.127
Here, look. See that?

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:27.129
Baldy.

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:29.130
Baldy, 1918, June 22.

01:19:29.132 --> 01:19:30.831
They said they
only could name him baldy

01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:33.868
because that was the only name
they knew him by

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:35.803
was his stage name.

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:38.239
4 horse driver, 1918.

01:19:38.241 --> 01:19:40.741
Unknown male,
unknown male.

01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:44.411
Unknown male,
unknown male, unknown male.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:45.813
All these graves are unknown.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:47.255
All these graves
are unknown.

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.950
<i> Maybe it all started</i>
<i>in Chicago</i>

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:52.052
<i>with the deaths of these clowns.</i>

01:19:52.054 --> 01:19:54.421
<i>Maybe all it takes</i>
<i>is a little tragedy</i>

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:57.291
<i>to unlock the even</i>
<i>darker places</i>
<i>in our mind.</i>

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:01.295
<i>One thing is for certain...</i>

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.998
<i>there's no going back</i>
<i>to the innocent clown.</i>

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.834
<i>The scales have been tipped</i>
<i>and the evidence proves it.</i>

01:20:06.836 --> 01:20:09.870
<i>Clowns can do scary things.</i>

01:20:09.872 --> 01:20:12.206
<i>They can even become killers.</i>

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:17.545
<i>...314, shooting</i>
<i>at century theaters.</i>

01:20:17.547 --> 01:20:20.214
<i>14300, east Alameda Avenue.</i>

01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:22.349
<i>They're saying somebody</i>
<i>is shooting in the auditorium.</i>

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:24.785
We got seven down
and.

01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:24.785
Seven down.

01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:27.888
I've got a child victim...
I need rescue.

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:33.294
<i> Breaking news</i>
<i>coming out of aurora, Colorado.</i>

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:35.162
<i>A scene</i>
<i>of a shooting this morning.</i>

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.531
<i>A movie theater</i>
<i>where "the dark knight rises"</i>

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:38.866
<i>was being shown.</i>

01:20:38.868 --> 01:20:41.202
<i>On July 20, 2012,</i>

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:43.370
<i>James Holmes commits</i>
<i>one of the worse mass shootings</i>

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:43.370
<i>in recent history.</i>

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:47.007
<i>But if the massacre itself</i>
<i>weren't horrific enough,</i>

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:50.177
<i>James's costuming</i>
<i>was an ominous testament</i>

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:54.448
<i>to the allure</i>
<i>of a very specific clown.</i>

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:56.884
<i>Introduce a little anarchy,</i>

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:59.153
<i>upset the established order.</i>

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:02.890
Then everything becomes chaos.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.928
I'm an agent of chaos.

01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:09.964
<i> Holmes's embodiment</i>
<i>of the joker,</i>

01:21:09.966 --> 01:21:11.565
<i>a villain</i>
<i>who has come to represent</i>

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:15.302
<i>the ultimate destruction</i>
<i>of our civilized world</i>

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:17.004
<i>is no coincidence.</i>

01:21:18.975 --> 01:21:21.976
<i>In our never-ending attempts</i>
<i>to sanitize society,</i>

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:27.848
<i>we sometimes reap what we sow.</i>

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:28.983
<i> In a sense,</i>
<i>you can really look at it s</i> as

01:21:28.985 --> 01:21:31.585
a possible backlash.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:35.055
He felt this compulsion
to water the clown down

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:39.159
into this cartoonish,
harmless being,

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:42.229
<i>and maybe underlying traits</i>
<i>of the archetype</i>

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.398
<i>just came back with a vengeance.</i>

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.635
<i> Holmes's joker-fueled</i>
<i>rampage not only signified</i>

01:21:47.637 --> 01:21:51.038
<i>that the clown's transformation</i>
<i>from innocent to evil</i>

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.041
<i>was finally complete,</i>
<i>but it also revealed</i>

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:57.978
<i>what was truly lurking</i>
<i>inside of us all.</i>

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.315
We think of ourselves as one,
and in fact we're really

01:22:01.317 --> 01:22:04.985
kind of a parliament
of personalities.

01:22:04.987 --> 01:22:09.890
<i>The killer clown</i>
<i>is one of our personalities,</i>

01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:11.458
<i>it's part of us.</i>

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:14.428
And so therefore,
we have to be very careful

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:20.034
not to let the killer clown out
except, in a safe way...

01:22:20.036 --> 01:22:21.635
except in a playful way.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.572
See, madness as you know,

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:28.976
is like gravity.

01:22:28.978 --> 01:22:31.412
All it takes is a little push.

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:38.585
<i>The babysitter killer,</i>

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:41.655
<i>the hook man,</i>
<i>the Halloween sadist,</i>

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:43.691
<i>the killer clown...</i>

01:22:43.693 --> 01:22:45.960
<i>what can we learn</i>
<i>from these urban legends</i>

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:49.463
<i>and from the true crimes</i>
<i>that may have inspired them?</i>

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:53.067
<i>Maybe these monsters,</i>
<i>despite our overwhelming desire</i>

01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:56.937
<i>to believe otherwise,</i>
<i>just aren't real.</i>

01:22:56.939 --> 01:22:58.572
<i>By presenting false boogeymen,</i>

01:22:58.574 --> 01:23:00.174
<i>our urban legends are helping us</i>

01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:03.711
<i>to make sense of crimes</i>
<i>too wicked to comprehend.</i>

01:23:03.713 --> 01:23:06.313
<i> An urban legend,</i>
<i>even though it can be scary,</i>

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:11.051
<i>it's not nearly as scary</i>
<i>as the actual murderers</i>

01:23:11.053 --> 01:23:13.454
that live in the world with us.

01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:16.190
<i> But peel back the</i>
<i>layers of any campfire tale,</i>

01:23:16.192 --> 01:23:18.359
<i>and you'll understand</i>
<i>the inherent truth</i>

01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:20.661
<i>that despite our need</i>
<i>to believe in an evil,</i>

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:24.164
<i>in a darker force,</i>
<i>it just isn't true.</i>

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.166
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>the only real boogeyman</i>

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:28.402
<i>is the one that lurks</i>
<i>inside of us all,</i>

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:32.506
<i>waiting for just</i>
<i>the right moment to emerge.</i>

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:35.542
<i>So what's the lesson</i>
<i>behind this cautionary tale?</i>

01:23:35.544 --> 01:23:37.277
<i>The warning here is simple...</i>

01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:40.347
<i>be afraid, not of the story,</i>

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:42.216
<i>but of the storyteller.</i>
