02:05.672 --> 02:07.799
I'm inviting you for breakfast.

02:12.595 --> 02:15.098
I can't.
I have to go to church.

02:19.727 --> 02:21.813
Well, after church then.

02:22.188 --> 02:24.732
Come on,
we haven't seen you for so long.

02:25.149 --> 02:27.318
Why don't you put this on,
because

02:27.652 --> 02:30.780
I don't want your little baby
to get sick.

02:31.322 --> 02:32.991
It's so cold out.

02:37.787 --> 02:39.372
- Come on!
- Okay.

02:42.041 --> 02:43.459
Okay?

02:45.753 --> 02:47.422
You'll come?

02:48.256 --> 02:49.591
Oh, yeah.

02:51.676 --> 02:52.927
Great!

02:53.344 --> 02:56.890
- Could you put the whole thing on?
- Oh, yeah. - Okay.

02:57.849 --> 02:59.100
See you.

03:17.869 --> 03:19.787
You owe me five dollars.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.836
Not till he's sitting at the table.
I don't owe you anything yet.

03:29.214 --> 03:31.925
Something's going on with him.
I'm worried.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.928
You keep saying that.
I think your...

03:35.887 --> 03:38.598
Your maternal instincts
might be kicking in.

03:45.230 --> 03:47.106
In all the world,

03:47.524 --> 03:51.694
there are books and books
and books of laws.

03:52.445 --> 03:57.033
But in all this world,
there really is only one Lord.

03:58.159 --> 04:02.288
We need never ask:
"Lord, what should I do?",

04:02.705 --> 04:06.292
because the Lord
has told us what to do.

04:07.001 --> 04:09.212
"Love one another."

04:10.213 --> 04:14.634
That, my friends,
is the one true law.

04:15.009 --> 04:18.930
Love is God in action.

04:19.764 --> 04:22.517
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the love of God,

04:22.600 --> 04:26.688
the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
be with you all now and forever more.

04:27.438 --> 04:29.107
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:35.530 --> 04:37.782
Hi, Mrs. Gruner.
Do you want some help?

04:37.866 --> 04:40.076
- Thank you, dear.
- Okay.

04:41.119 --> 04:44.122
It's my turn
to drop them off at the hospital.

04:47.375 --> 04:50.003
You're a good-looking fellow, Lars.

04:50.211 --> 04:51.838
Where's your girlfriend?

04:51.963 --> 04:53.506
I don't have one.

04:53.965 --> 04:55.425
- Are you gay?
- No.

04:55.508 --> 04:58.177
My grandson's gay,
I know all about the gays.

04:58.261 --> 05:00.221
I know, but I'm not gay, so...

05:00.430 --> 05:05.018
- Well, don't leave it too long.
It's not good for you. - Okay.

05:07.312 --> 05:08.354
Here.

05:10.148 --> 05:12.025
Give this to somebody nice.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.568
For a start.

05:17.572 --> 05:19.240
Hello, Lars.

05:34.380 --> 05:35.632
I guess...

05:35.924 --> 05:38.885
- I'll see you at work tomorrow.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

05:42.472 --> 05:45.850
Karin, my brother is 27-years-old.
Maybe he wants to be left alone.

05:45.934 --> 05:48.686
- That's not what he wants.
- Really? Hey, just...

05:48.770 --> 05:51.814
Go.
How do you know that exactly?

05:51.898 --> 05:55.235
Because that's not how people are.

05:57.946 --> 05:59.197
There he goes.

06:03.910 --> 06:07.038
Lars! Come on, you promised!

06:14.754 --> 06:17.257
- Is that normal?
- Five dollars.

07:01.301 --> 07:02.468
Morning!

07:02.552 --> 07:03.970
Good morning, Cindy.

07:04.053 --> 07:05.889
Did you have a nice weekend?

07:07.682 --> 07:09.976
That new girl's kind of cute, huh?

07:10.935 --> 07:13.313
You and Margo!
What do you think?

07:25.241 --> 07:27.619
Lars, you've got to see this!

07:27.952 --> 07:30.580
I'm not really in the mood
for porn this morning.

07:30.663 --> 07:31.706
It's not porn.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.794
Okay, it is,
but check it out, alright?

07:38.922 --> 07:41.841
You like?
Man, it's solid!

07:42.217 --> 07:46.221
If she'd weigh 125 pounds,
then she weighs 125 pounds.

07:46.304 --> 07:47.347
Is that right?

07:47.430 --> 07:51.351
You can customize everything.
They've got different heads and parts.

07:51.476 --> 07:53.311
You can design your own woman!

07:54.854 --> 07:56.231
And, Lars...

07:57.190 --> 07:58.608
- Lars!
- Yeah?

08:01.277 --> 08:03.238
They're anatomically correct.

08:09.285 --> 08:11.496
You aren't going to buy one, are you?

08:11.913 --> 08:13.039
I wish.

08:13.873 --> 08:17.252
Look how much they cost.
I'm wiped out from the X-box.

08:18.503 --> 08:20.046
Morning.

08:21.923 --> 08:24.300
- Morning!
- Oh, hey! Yeah. Morning!

08:24.384 --> 08:26.886
Margo's here, everybody!
Hurray!

08:31.808 --> 08:33.726
Could you put the headset on?

08:40.316 --> 08:42.193
I was thinking,

08:42.277 --> 08:44.946
we're the only ones from the lake.
We could carpool.

08:46.781 --> 08:49.158
Lars, it's your day for coffee, buddy.

08:49.576 --> 08:50.743
Oh, yeah.

08:55.206 --> 08:58.585
You know what your problem is?
You're just too aggressive.

08:58.668 --> 09:03.047
- Just chillax, you know?
- Shut up.

09:12.056 --> 09:13.308
Wait. Stop.

09:13.433 --> 09:14.475
Stop!

09:15.935 --> 09:19.105
Karin! What? What?

09:20.273 --> 09:22.275
We want you to come for dinner.

09:24.652 --> 09:26.196
Will you come?

09:34.454 --> 09:35.496
You scared me.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.208
- Sorry! Sorry.
- You scared me.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.418
Oh, sweetheart. Sorry.

09:41.336 --> 09:42.587
Wait.

09:42.795 --> 09:46.883
- It's okay. I can't. I can't.
- Why not? No!

09:47.842 --> 09:50.345
Why not?
Come on, Lars, we miss you.

09:54.599 --> 09:57.977
I brought my work home, so I have to...
I'll get in trouble.

09:59.103 --> 10:00.230
No, you didn't.

10:00.438 --> 10:02.565
Did you hear that?
That's my phone, I think.

10:02.649 --> 10:05.944
No, come on, wait! Wait!
Lars! Stop! Stop!

10:09.155 --> 10:12.492
- Come on, please?
- I have other plans.

10:13.409 --> 10:14.536
And I can't.

10:15.495 --> 10:19.207
Lars, there's salmon
and cherry pie in there.

10:21.709 --> 10:24.754
- Could you please let me go?
- No.

10:27.799 --> 10:29.050
Okay.

10:44.399 --> 10:46.025
Is that all you can eat?

10:46.150 --> 10:48.736
- Yeah, that was delicious. Thank you.
- Okay.

10:48.820 --> 10:51.406
No, no, you stay there.
No, it's my turn.

10:52.574 --> 10:53.908
You boys talk.

11:02.375 --> 11:05.503
Okay...
Karin's been worried about you.

11:05.587 --> 11:09.507
She thinks you've got a problem because
you spend so much time by yourself.

11:12.927 --> 11:14.387
I'm fine.

11:14.721 --> 11:17.807
That's what I told her.
That's exactly what I said.

11:18.725 --> 11:20.101
Okay.

11:20.518 --> 11:23.396
Dad was kind of like that too, so...

11:24.397 --> 11:28.109
Yeah, but he didn't want
anyone around. That's the difference.

11:30.278 --> 11:31.696
That's not true.

11:35.408 --> 11:38.411
Okay. You know? Yeah, sure,
maybe after mom died,

11:38.620 --> 11:41.748
but you didn't even know him
before that. So...

11:43.208 --> 11:46.878
I mean, not that you could have,
but I'm just saying...

12:00.350 --> 12:03.311
Karin and I would really like it
if you moved in.

12:06.147 --> 12:08.107
No, that's okay. Thank you.

12:08.233 --> 12:10.109
The house is half yours.

12:10.318 --> 12:12.403
I know, but I'm fine, thanks.

12:13.780 --> 12:15.740
I'm just putting it out there.

12:19.827 --> 12:23.289
- Well, goodnight. Sleep tight.
- Goodnight.

12:24.415 --> 12:26.793
Wait.
Here's some leftovers for you.

12:27.544 --> 12:29.087
Do you have my blanket?

12:29.295 --> 12:32.674
- Oh, yeah. It's on the...
- I'll get it. Grab these.

12:33.216 --> 12:34.968
I'll be right back.

12:38.346 --> 12:40.223
It's a beautiful blanket.

12:40.849 --> 12:43.726
- Gus says your mother made it for you.
- Yeah.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.311
When she was pregnant.

12:48.273 --> 12:52.569
She must have loved you very much,
like we do.

12:59.450 --> 13:02.370
- Are you mad at me?
- Is he coming?

13:03.204 --> 13:06.207
- Here we go. - Goodnight.
- Thanks. Goodnight.

13:14.799 --> 13:16.050
What?

13:16.342 --> 13:17.802
We talked, he's fine.

13:59.302 --> 14:02.138
- Hello?
- Hey, Lars. It's Karin.

14:02.222 --> 14:04.557
They just delivered
a huge box for you.

14:04.641 --> 14:06.017
It's in the garage.

14:08.770 --> 14:11.147
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay, bye.

14:12.106 --> 14:13.274
Thanks.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.586
That's a nice sweater.

15:31.102 --> 15:32.353
Hey!

15:33.062 --> 15:34.522
Come on in.

15:38.818 --> 15:41.654
That's okay.
Is Karin gonna come to the door?

15:41.738 --> 15:42.989
Karin!

15:43.448 --> 15:44.574
Yeah?

15:44.657 --> 15:46.576
Honey, come here, it's Lars!

15:47.493 --> 15:49.162
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:50.413 --> 15:54.792
She's just doing some kind of...

15:55.126 --> 15:58.129
It's pregnant women's yoga.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.593
No, it's good.
It's good, good stuff.

16:03.676 --> 16:05.011
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:05.136 --> 16:06.346
What's up?

16:10.683 --> 16:12.143
I have a visitor.

16:13.811 --> 16:15.772
- You have...?
- In the garage?

16:16.064 --> 16:17.732
- Now?
- Yeah.

16:18.066 --> 16:19.400
A visitor?

16:20.151 --> 16:22.111
That's great!

16:23.154 --> 16:24.531
Yeah.

16:25.657 --> 16:27.283
And she's not from here.

16:27.742 --> 16:28.910
She?

16:29.494 --> 16:30.537
Yeah.

16:31.412 --> 16:33.706
Wow, what do you know?

16:33.790 --> 16:37.043
Where did you meet this person?

16:37.585 --> 16:40.797
- On the Internet.
- Yeah, everybody's doing that now.

16:41.631 --> 16:43.091
That's great!

16:44.717 --> 16:47.178
She doesn't speak much English, though.

16:48.221 --> 16:51.182
That's okay.
It's the same with the guys at work.

16:51.808 --> 16:54.102
- It's not that big a deal.
- Okay.

16:56.187 --> 16:58.731
Oh, yeah.
You know, she's in a wheelchair,

16:58.815 --> 17:01.234
so I don't want her
to feel weird about it.

17:01.317 --> 17:03.403
- We don't care.
- Oh, no. No.

17:03.486 --> 17:04.612
Okay.

17:04.945 --> 17:08.907
And I have to ask you a really...
I know it's a really big favor.

17:09.951 --> 17:11.118
Yeah.

17:11.536 --> 17:15.832
Well...
She's really religious and,

17:15.957 --> 17:18.209
because we're both young and single,

17:18.292 --> 17:21.671
it doesn't feel right for us
to stay in the garage alone together.

17:21.753 --> 17:23.964
No.
We'll put her in the pink room.

17:24.048 --> 17:26.675
- She could sleep here.
- In the pink room? - Yeah!

17:26.759 --> 17:29.804
- Okay.
- Sure! And there are new towels.

17:33.057 --> 17:36.060
Just give us half an hour to pick up

17:36.269 --> 17:38.354
and get something in the oven.

17:38.438 --> 17:40.648
- Okey-dokey.
- Let's get the place ready.

17:45.028 --> 17:47.322
Okay. Let's get started!

17:49.365 --> 17:51.492
Man, that is...

17:52.911 --> 17:56.372
You quiet ones...
You know what they say.

17:57.749 --> 18:01.044
It's great. It's great.
See you in a little bit.

18:01.252 --> 18:02.837
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:25.777 --> 18:28.696
You know, Bianca's a missionary.

18:29.739 --> 18:31.741
Was a missionary.
Right, sorry.

18:31.824 --> 18:33.243
She was raised by nuns.

18:33.326 --> 18:36.162
But now she's on a sabbatical,
she can experience the world.

18:36.246 --> 18:37.413
Isn't that neat?

18:44.212 --> 18:45.463
She's shy.

18:47.131 --> 18:48.716
Well, you are.

18:50.176 --> 18:51.511
Everything's so new

18:52.679 --> 18:54.639
for her. Right?

19:00.812 --> 19:03.231
- Are you hungry?
- We're starving.

19:05.733 --> 19:07.986
Gus, will you give me
a hand in the kitchen?

19:14.409 --> 19:15.660
How was that?

19:17.120 --> 19:18.371
I know.

19:20.582 --> 19:22.333
He's out of his mind.

19:24.794 --> 19:26.129
Oh, my God!

19:27.171 --> 19:29.924
It seems crazy, right?
I mean, he's crazy!

19:32.177 --> 19:35.597
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. - What are we gonna do?

19:38.808 --> 19:40.351
Oh, my God!

19:40.476 --> 19:43.229
We have to put him in a hospital,
I think.

19:43.313 --> 19:45.773
We have to put him in a hospital,
I can't afford that.

19:45.857 --> 19:49.652
Karin, I can't believe this.
My little brother is totally insane!

19:49.736 --> 19:52.197
- Pull yourself together.
- How am l...? - Gus!

19:52.280 --> 19:55.158
- Calm down! - How can l?
- Calm down, okay? Now!

19:55.241 --> 19:56.743
He's talking to a doll!

19:57.869 --> 20:00.163
We've just got to get
through this somehow, okay?

20:00.246 --> 20:02.624
- I don't know how we're gonna
do that. - Me neither.

20:02.707 --> 20:04.334
But you've gotta be calm.

20:05.168 --> 20:06.419
Okay?

20:06.961 --> 20:08.129
Okay.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.717
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

20:17.055 --> 20:19.265
Karin, she's not gonna eat!

20:48.628 --> 20:50.672
You're never gonna believe this.

20:51.339 --> 20:53.341
It makes me mad.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.844
Bianca's from the tropics.

20:56.427 --> 20:58.429
She's Brazilian.

20:59.889 --> 21:03.059
Well, half Brazilian, half Danish,
that's right.

21:04.602 --> 21:08.231
And somebody stole her luggage.

21:10.525 --> 21:13.361
Yeah!
And they stole her wheelchair.

21:17.407 --> 21:18.867
That's terrible.

21:20.118 --> 21:22.453
Yeah!
Can you believe that, Gus?

21:23.454 --> 21:25.707
- Yeah, I can't believe it.
- Right.

21:27.542 --> 21:31.713
Well, it makes me angry.
Anyway...

21:34.340 --> 21:38.928
I wanted to ask you a favor.
She doesn't mind, I promise.

21:39.262 --> 21:43.224
Karin, would you mind lending Bianca
some clothes? She doesn't have any.

21:55.737 --> 21:56.779
Do you?

21:56.988 --> 21:59.449
I'm not sure we're the same type, Lars.

21:59.616 --> 22:01.784
That's okay, Karin, because

22:02.076 --> 22:05.997
Bianca doesn't care about superficial
things like that, so it's okay.

22:15.048 --> 22:17.550
- Sure.
- Yeah, that's right.

22:18.092 --> 22:21.137
See? I told you.
Thanks.

22:23.223 --> 22:28.853
This used to be my mom's room.
So...

22:29.687 --> 22:32.774
If you need anything,
Gus and Karin are across the hall.

22:32.941 --> 22:34.400
I'm in the garage.

22:35.944 --> 22:38.446
You know that, so what else?

22:39.405 --> 22:42.450
Your towels are brand-new,
thanks to Karin.

22:45.036 --> 22:48.289
Lars, I think we should go to bed.

22:48.498 --> 22:49.541
Oh, okay.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.877
Just one second.

22:53.962 --> 22:57.131
I just wanted to say
I'm so glad you're finally here.

22:58.716 --> 23:01.010
I think right now...

23:02.512 --> 23:04.389
Yeah. Okay, goodnight.

23:14.983 --> 23:17.986
Wait!
Gus had a good idea.

23:18.319 --> 23:22.365
He's concerned about Bianca's health.

23:23.324 --> 23:27.370
You know, with the traveling,
the change of climate, and everything...

23:27.453 --> 23:29.330
Well, it's stress, you know?

23:30.290 --> 23:33.293
I'll make an appointment
with Doctor Berman for tomorrow.

23:33.376 --> 23:34.711
For early tomorrow.

23:34.794 --> 23:36.296
We'll all go.

23:36.838 --> 23:39.340
Yeah. You remember Dagmar?

23:40.341 --> 23:44.637
- Okay. Do you think that's a good idea?
- I do. I think we should do it.

23:45.263 --> 23:46.514
Yeah.

23:46.681 --> 23:49.601
- That's a good idea, I was gonna go...
- Let's go to bed.

23:49.684 --> 23:51.644
...shopping for wheelchairs, anyway.

23:51.936 --> 23:54.147
- So, goodnight.
- Night.

23:54.814 --> 23:56.316
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:45.490 --> 24:46.991
Oh, my God.

25:08.263 --> 25:10.473
Natasha escaped from Moscow,

25:10.557 --> 25:13.560
where she was forced to strip
for the Russian mob.

25:13.685 --> 25:17.063
Now all she wants is
an all-American male to love.

25:17.397 --> 25:23.027
Midori left a high-paying job in Tokyo
because she was unsatisfied as a woman.

25:24.028 --> 25:27.490
Tammy dropped out of high school
to join the rodeo.

25:27.615 --> 25:31.452
Are you the right cowboy
to tame this wild filly?

25:46.092 --> 25:48.386
The doctor will tell us what to do.

25:49.470 --> 25:52.140
But she's family practice.
We need a shrink.

25:52.223 --> 25:54.767
No, she's a psychologist, too.

25:58.479 --> 26:01.065
She says you have to be,
this far north.

26:06.196 --> 26:08.072
What'll people think?

26:10.783 --> 26:12.869
We can't worry about that.

26:16.623 --> 26:17.874
Right.

26:35.725 --> 26:38.269
Right there
is where my dad used to work.

26:39.604 --> 26:40.772
Our dad.

26:42.440 --> 26:46.444
That's the library. I have a card,
you can borrow it if you want to.

26:46.694 --> 26:50.907
Actually, I'll have to take them out
for you, but you just tell me.

26:51.908 --> 26:55.286
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know, actually. Gus?

26:56.204 --> 26:57.956
What was it that dad did?

26:59.541 --> 27:01.125
Water and Power.

27:10.593 --> 27:13.221
My job's at the School Department.

27:16.391 --> 27:19.644
I miss everybody, but there's
so much to do in the house.

27:20.144 --> 27:23.231
I'll go back
as soon as the baby's old enough and...

27:41.499 --> 27:43.001
Yeah. Sure.

27:43.918 --> 27:45.503
"Reader's Digest",

27:46.880 --> 27:50.008
"Midwest Living" or "Country Home"?

27:51.467 --> 27:53.094
That's what I would say.

28:07.108 --> 28:10.653
Well, her blood pressure's low.

28:15.742 --> 28:19.204
- Is that serious? - Could be.
We'll have to wait and see.

28:24.125 --> 28:25.168
It's fine.

28:26.836 --> 28:28.504
Mine's probably low, too.

28:34.802 --> 28:35.929
I...

28:36.930 --> 28:40.642
I want you to bring her in
every week for a special treatment.

28:41.809 --> 28:43.144
Can you do that?

28:47.815 --> 28:50.735
Are you sure that's necessary?

28:52.445 --> 28:55.990
- Yes.
- Okay. Okay.

28:57.534 --> 28:58.910
What do you think?

29:00.161 --> 29:02.664
If that's what she says,
then we should.

29:03.915 --> 29:05.166
Okay.

29:05.667 --> 29:08.795
You can set that up with Joanna,
at the desk.

29:10.839 --> 29:13.550
I look forward
to getting to know you, Bianca.

29:17.720 --> 29:21.474
- Karin, I'm telling you,
he belongs in a hospital! - No!

29:22.183 --> 29:25.061
My Uncle Garth went to one
of those places and never came back.

29:25.144 --> 29:27.397
But he needs more help
than we are able to give.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.817
- I told you something was wrong
and you wouldn't listen! - If I may.

29:32.861 --> 29:34.654
Has Lars been functional?

29:34.821 --> 29:37.365
Does he go to work,
wash, dress himself?

29:37.532 --> 29:38.992
So far.

29:40.702 --> 29:43.079
Has he had any violent episodes?

29:43.204 --> 29:47.458
No! No, never. He's a sweetheart,
he never even raises his voice.

29:47.584 --> 29:48.668
Okay.

29:48.877 --> 29:50.962
We gotta fix him.
Can you fix him?

29:51.212 --> 29:52.922
I don't know, Gus.

29:54.174 --> 29:57.802
I don't believe he's psychotic
or schizophrenic.

29:58.219 --> 30:02.390
I don't think this is caused by genes
or faulty wiring in the brain.

30:02.599 --> 30:04.809
So, what the hell is going on then?

30:04.893 --> 30:06.728
He appears to have a delusion.

30:06.811 --> 30:08.062
A delusion?

30:08.354 --> 30:11.566
What the hell is he doing
with a delusion, for Christ's sake?

30:11.649 --> 30:13.735
That's what we have to find out.

30:14.110 --> 30:17.155
Chances are he's been
decompensating for some time.

30:19.407 --> 30:21.409
I guess we didn't realize.

30:24.662 --> 30:28.917
Have there been any changes
in the family in the last year or so?

30:29.250 --> 30:31.502
No, everything is
pretty much exactly the same,

30:31.586 --> 30:35.173
except that Karin is pregnant
and Lars is nuts.

30:35.798 --> 30:38.551
You know, this isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

30:38.718 --> 30:43.139
What we call mental illness
isn't always just an illness.

30:43.264 --> 30:47.727
It can be a communication,
a way to work something out.

30:48.019 --> 30:50.021
Fantastic.
When will it be over?

30:50.104 --> 30:52.065
When he doesn't need it anymore.

30:55.151 --> 30:56.903
How can we help?

31:00.365 --> 31:03.618
- Go along with it.
- Oh, no. No, that's...

31:03.701 --> 31:09.249
Oh, my! No, no, no.
I mean, pretend that she's real?

31:09.499 --> 31:11.626
I can't.
I'm just not gonna do it.

31:11.751 --> 31:14.254
- She is real.
- Well... - I mean,

31:14.879 --> 31:16.381
she's right out there.

31:16.464 --> 31:18.007
Right. I get that.

31:18.132 --> 31:20.969
But I'm not gonna do it.

31:21.052 --> 31:23.596
You won't be able
to change his mind anyway.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.557
Bianca's in town for a reason.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.268
- Right, but...
- It's not really a choice.

31:31.062 --> 31:35.900
Okay. Okay. Alright.
Then we'll do it. Whatever it takes.

31:36.025 --> 31:39.028
Oh, yeah.
And everyone's gonna laugh at him.

31:39.863 --> 31:40.905
And you.

31:54.794 --> 31:56.129
She loves kids.

32:02.927 --> 32:05.430
- More coffee, Lars?
- Yes, please.

32:06.931 --> 32:08.474
You see the funny face?

32:11.060 --> 32:12.562
Does Bianca want some?

32:14.731 --> 32:15.899
Yeah.

32:17.233 --> 32:19.277
- There you go.
- Thank you, Karin.

32:19.861 --> 32:21.529
Gus? No? Okay.

32:22.906 --> 32:24.157
Sure.

32:29.787 --> 32:32.207
Are you not gonna
go to work today, Gus?

32:34.667 --> 32:37.003
- I don't feel good.
- Oh, no.

32:40.006 --> 32:42.967
Bianca could help you.
She has nurse's training.

32:43.176 --> 32:47.430
No, she doesn't. She doesn't
have nurse's training, Lars,

32:47.514 --> 32:49.390
because she's not a person.

32:49.641 --> 32:51.392
She's a big plastic thing.

32:53.728 --> 32:55.146
That's amazing.

32:57.190 --> 32:58.525
Did you hear that?

32:59.984 --> 33:02.987
Bianca just said that's why
God made her, to help people.

33:12.205 --> 33:13.706
Are you gonna be late?

33:14.541 --> 33:15.667
For work?

33:20.505 --> 33:22.048
I am gonna be late.

33:22.757 --> 33:24.342
I have to go.

33:24.592 --> 33:25.718
Okay.

33:26.177 --> 33:28.680
But I'm going to check in.

33:29.097 --> 33:30.223
Okey-doke.

33:30.306 --> 33:33.184
- You have my number at work,
right, Karin? - Yeah.

33:40.567 --> 33:43.528
I wanted to tell you
you look really pretty today.

33:48.116 --> 33:50.159
I hope you feel better, Gus.

33:51.244 --> 33:52.370
Me, too.

33:52.662 --> 33:55.123
- And thanks so much for breakfast.
- No.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.459
- Okay, gotta go. Bye!
- See you!

34:03.464 --> 34:05.466
Well, I had to try. You know...

34:07.302 --> 34:13.056
- What? What? What?
- It's just... I don't know.

34:14.976 --> 34:18.771
It's true. We've been all wrapped up
in ourselves. We have, Gus!

34:18.855 --> 34:22.275
This is not my fault, though.
It's not my fault.

34:29.741 --> 34:32.577
Come on, Bianca.
Let's make a couple of calls.

34:48.760 --> 34:51.221
Good morning, Cindy.
You look pretty today.

34:51.304 --> 34:53.181
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Sunshine...

34:55.683 --> 35:01.648
It's way in advance, but you know
how excited I get about these things.

35:08.196 --> 35:12.450
- Where are they? I know you took them.
- Did not. - You did, too. As revenge.

35:12.534 --> 35:15.078
- For what?
- The fake rat I put in your drawer.

35:15.161 --> 35:16.162
Oh, that.

35:16.246 --> 35:18.998
Lars, I'm missing 3
of my action figures.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.502
It's your turn to get coffee.

35:22.752 --> 35:27.048
Listen up, Margo. Those action figures
are extremely important to me.

35:27.131 --> 35:28.508
They're worth a lot of money.

35:28.591 --> 35:31.052
If I don't see every damn one
back on my desk soon,

35:31.135 --> 35:34.430
you can tell your teddy bear
to watch his back.

35:45.525 --> 35:48.152
I'll return them.
One at a time.

35:53.741 --> 35:57.120
- Are you going to Cindy's party?
- Oh, no.

35:58.913 --> 36:02.876
I was hoping you would.
I really wish you would.

36:05.461 --> 36:06.838
Well, maybe.

36:07.755 --> 36:09.048
That'd be great!

36:10.884 --> 36:13.136
Do you think
I could bring my girlfriend?

36:14.345 --> 36:16.472
Yeah!

36:16.639 --> 36:19.267
Yeah. I mean,
I'm totally bringing somebody.

36:27.317 --> 36:28.401
Wow.

36:28.484 --> 36:30.361
I didn't know there were sex dolls!

36:30.445 --> 36:32.572
Love dolls.
That's what they call them.

36:33.907 --> 36:35.575
I saw a special on cable.

36:35.742 --> 36:38.286
So you're serious?
Bianca really has a...

36:41.122 --> 36:43.917
She's really
just one of the girls then.

36:45.752 --> 36:47.003
I'm sorry.

36:47.128 --> 36:49.797
Que un hombre se compró
una muñeca que se infla...

36:49.881 --> 36:51.633
Le salen las tetas así,
el tipo se la come...

36:52.675 --> 36:54.052
Sale volando.

36:55.929 --> 36:57.263
No way!

36:59.682 --> 37:01.226
Does she have a sister?

37:03.186 --> 37:05.438
I wish I had a woman
that couldn't talk.

37:09.359 --> 37:11.486
It's not that funny.
It's not that funny.

37:11.569 --> 37:15.031
We don't want anything to do with her.
She's a golden calf.

37:15.657 --> 37:17.325
We all know what happened with that.

37:17.408 --> 37:20.036
He's not worshipping her.
They're just dating?

37:20.119 --> 37:22.413
These young people have no willpower!

37:22.497 --> 37:24.582
He's sick, alright? He's sick.

37:24.707 --> 37:30.338
We were just hoping, if we came to you,
you could help pave the way a little.

37:30.505 --> 37:33.258
If you could just try to understand...

37:33.383 --> 37:35.635
- He is a nice man.
- We can try.

37:35.760 --> 37:38.638
- I don't know why we're here.
- Oh, for Heaven's sake!

37:38.721 --> 37:40.265
What's the big deal?

37:41.224 --> 37:45.395
Sally, your cousin
puts dresses on his cats.

37:46.020 --> 37:50.525
Hazel, your nephew
gave all his money to a UFO club.

37:51.025 --> 37:53.695
Arnie, everybody knows
your first wife was a klepto.

37:53.778 --> 37:56.656
- She wasn't! - Why is she buried
in a pair of my earrings?

37:57.240 --> 37:59.117
That's enough.

37:59.909 --> 38:01.494
These things happen.

38:03.037 --> 38:04.789
Lars is a good boy.

38:08.668 --> 38:10.336
You can depend on me.

38:11.296 --> 38:12.755
Thanks, Mrs. Gruner.

38:13.173 --> 38:17.427
Well, he's not bringing her to church,
is he, Reverend Bock?

38:18.178 --> 38:23.516
Well...
The question is, as always,

38:26.436 --> 38:28.104
what would Jesus do?

38:31.733 --> 38:40.742
#Oh, Holy, Holy,
merciful and mighty.#

38:40.909 --> 38:49.918
#God in three Persons.
Blessed Trinity.#

38:55.131 --> 38:57.550
I would like to take the opportunity

38:57.675 --> 39:01.221
to welcome all of our new visitors
to our church today.

39:02.889 --> 39:06.851
Bianca, it's good to see you.
Lars, God bless. God bless.

39:06.976 --> 39:10.813
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

39:11.940 --> 39:13.900
- Watch yourself.
- Easy, easy.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.614
These are for you, Bianca.

39:21.074 --> 39:22.075
Thank you.

39:22.158 --> 39:24.327
Bianca, this is my friend,
Mrs. Gruner.

39:25.787 --> 39:27.539
She has a darling figure.

39:32.544 --> 39:36.381
Those are nice. They're not real,
so they'll last forever. Isn't that neat?

39:38.550 --> 39:39.801
Hello.

39:43.179 --> 39:44.430
Get back here!

40:17.630 --> 40:20.466
There we go.
Watch your head on the way in.

40:21.176 --> 40:23.803
Watch, watch!
There we go.

40:26.598 --> 40:30.560
Are you comfortable?
I'll get the chair.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.897
Can you put her seatbelt on?

40:34.105 --> 40:36.816
Bianca, Gus is gonna
put on your seatbelt.

40:38.151 --> 40:41.446
- And put that on her legs.
She gets cold. Thank you. - Yeah.

40:54.334 --> 40:55.793
Thanks, Gus.

40:57.253 --> 41:00.173
Where are you guys going?

41:03.843 --> 41:05.053
Just one second.

41:06.679 --> 41:09.933
She doesn't know. It's a secret.
But I can tell you.

41:10.225 --> 41:13.978
She's asking questions all the time
and wants to know all about me,

41:14.062 --> 41:15.772
so I thought I'd take her

41:15.897 --> 41:18.816
to the lake, where we used to play.

41:19.943 --> 41:22.362
- Yeah.
- Do you remember that? - Yeah.

41:23.112 --> 41:25.365
That sounds nice.

41:27.158 --> 41:29.035
Yeah. I gotta go.

41:29.786 --> 41:31.746
I'm coming
Why are you yelling?

41:55.103 --> 41:58.231
Gus and his friends
used to come up here all the time.

41:58.481 --> 42:00.775
In the summer they'd go fishing.

42:00.984 --> 42:03.862
In the winter they'd play hockey.

42:10.410 --> 42:11.786
Watch your head.

42:13.329 --> 42:14.581
Here we go.

42:16.457 --> 42:17.792
That's okay.

42:19.544 --> 42:23.548
This was our tree-house.
The rope's here.

42:23.965 --> 42:26.134
And the ladder.

42:42.483 --> 42:48.239
#L is for the way you look at me,#

42:48.448 --> 42:56.080
#O is for the only one I see,#

42:56.289 --> 43:04.005
#V is very, very extraordinary,#

43:04.214 --> 43:13.097
#E is even more
than anyone that you adore.#

43:13.223 --> 43:21.564
#And love
is all that I can give to you,#

43:21.731 --> 43:29.197
#Love
is more than just a game for two.#

43:29.572 --> 43:34.494
#Two in love can make it...#

43:37.205 --> 43:39.290
You should watch me
chop wood, too.

43:40.583 --> 43:42.126
I'm really good at it.

43:52.929 --> 43:54.180
I'm sorry.

43:55.223 --> 43:58.268
I couldn't wait.
I wanted to see how she was doing.

43:58.351 --> 44:02.689
After the treatment, she has to rest.
It doesn't work without the resting.

44:05.859 --> 44:08.903
Keep me company?
Lars?

44:09.696 --> 44:10.947
Keep me company.

44:21.291 --> 44:24.419
Do you know how many sessions
she's gonna have to have?

44:26.838 --> 44:30.508
No. I don't, it's a tricky illness.

44:31.926 --> 44:37.765
But, what I could use
is a more complete history on her.

44:37.974 --> 44:41.019
- Parents...
- They died when she was a baby.

44:42.270 --> 44:45.190
- That's not fair.
- Yeah, but...

44:46.107 --> 44:48.610
She doesn't feel sorry
for herself or anything.

44:48.693 --> 44:52.238
She just wants to be normal,
have everyone treat her normal.

44:54.908 --> 45:00.455
- That's nice. I admire that.
- Me too. Is that your husband?

45:01.289 --> 45:05.126
- Yes. He died.
- Oh, no.

45:06.920 --> 45:08.379
I'm sorry.

45:10.465 --> 45:12.258
- Do you have kids?
- No.

45:17.597 --> 45:19.390
You must get really lonely.

45:19.641 --> 45:22.685
Sometimes I get so lonely,
I forget what day it is and

45:22.769 --> 45:24.270
how to spell my name.

45:30.527 --> 45:31.903
How about you?

45:35.532 --> 45:36.699
You're funny.

45:38.368 --> 45:41.746
So what's the difference between
a delusion and a hallucination?

45:42.330 --> 45:46.084
It's false perception
versus false belief.

45:46.167 --> 45:49.337
- So when Moose thinks
the FBI's after him... - The DEA.

45:49.420 --> 45:52.757
- INS.
- IRS. ATF. AAA.

45:52.882 --> 45:54.467
That would be a delusion.

45:54.551 --> 45:56.845
Hey, dude,
they are after us.

46:03.768 --> 46:05.436
My dad told me that

46:08.147 --> 46:11.484
wood warms you three times:

46:12.527 --> 46:16.114
first when you chop down a tree,
then when you chop it up...

46:35.049 --> 46:38.261
- What are we doing? Why are we
doing this for him? - Come on.

46:40.305 --> 46:41.890
It's funny.

46:43.141 --> 46:44.392
Is it?

46:47.228 --> 46:48.688
I don't know.

46:48.897 --> 46:50.440
Maybe not.

46:56.404 --> 46:57.947
So tell me about Karin.

47:00.158 --> 47:03.077
- I don't know her very well.
- She's wonderful!

47:03.995 --> 47:07.332
Gus and I are both very lucky
with women. She's wonderful.

47:10.126 --> 47:11.920
But she...

47:16.174 --> 47:19.052
We don't have to talk.
Let's find you something to read.

47:19.344 --> 47:23.681
- No, it's just... Between us?
- Of course.

47:28.102 --> 47:29.646
I'm worried about her.

47:30.897 --> 47:33.024
I think she has a little problem.

47:33.316 --> 47:37.195
- Maybe you shouldn't tell me.
- No, it's okay. It's just...

47:40.823 --> 47:43.368
And I think it's
'cause she's insecure, but

47:43.868 --> 47:46.454
she's just always
trying to hug everybody.

47:46.746 --> 47:51.167
You know, some people don't like that!
Some people don't like to be hugged.

47:51.251 --> 47:55.463
But she doesn't realize that.
She takes it personally, and thinks...

47:56.005 --> 47:58.007
You know?
It hurts her feelings.

48:01.803 --> 48:03.930
I don't know what to do about that.

48:06.140 --> 48:07.559
Do you?

48:07.892 --> 48:12.272
But it's such a comfort sometimes,
to have somebody's arms around you.

48:12.397 --> 48:13.648
Don't you think?

48:14.983 --> 48:17.819
- No.
- Come on, it feels good.

48:19.279 --> 48:21.322
It does not feel good.
It hurts.

48:25.410 --> 48:28.162
Like a cut or a bruise?

48:28.288 --> 48:32.876
Like a burn. Like when you go outside
and your feet freeze

48:32.959 --> 48:36.129
and then you come back in
and they thaw out. It's like that.

48:37.797 --> 48:39.757
It's almost exactly like that.

48:40.675 --> 48:42.135
Same with everybody?

48:45.305 --> 48:47.473
Well, not really with Bianca.

48:50.935 --> 48:52.353
But everyone else.

48:52.979 --> 48:55.231
So, you don't let people touch you.

48:56.107 --> 48:58.359
Lars, isn't that hard
to get away with?

48:59.903 --> 49:03.656
Not really here,
'cause I have all these layers.

49:05.867 --> 49:07.744
- And that helps.
- Look...

49:08.828 --> 49:10.371
We can't change Karin.

49:11.915 --> 49:15.126
But I can help you.

49:23.384 --> 49:24.844
That's fine.

49:30.099 --> 49:31.351
Pain?

49:31.476 --> 49:33.228
Yeah, but I can take it.

49:43.446 --> 49:44.697
Are you okay?

49:48.535 --> 49:52.413
- Well, that's enough for today.
- Yeah. Thanks.

49:58.169 --> 49:59.754
What?

50:00.255 --> 50:01.840
Yeah, I'm okay.

50:12.600 --> 50:18.022
Well, it's scientifically proven
that everyone's favorite word

50:18.147 --> 50:20.024
is their own name, so

50:20.733 --> 50:22.068
if you just

50:22.819 --> 50:25.113
say their names a lot, you're okay.

50:27.115 --> 50:29.492
You can see
it's gonna make them happy.

50:31.494 --> 50:32.745
Okay.

50:49.971 --> 50:51.347
Yeah.

50:52.015 --> 50:53.183
Okay...

51:03.526 --> 51:05.570
Mr. Sunshine!

51:05.695 --> 51:10.074
And this must be Bianca. Welcome!
Welcome. Come on in!

51:18.833 --> 51:21.252
I have my boots on,
but I brought my shoes.

51:21.336 --> 51:23.963
Don't worry about it. Baxter?
Baxter, baby.

51:24.506 --> 51:26.716
Lars, this is my husband.

51:29.427 --> 51:31.179
Hi, Lars.

51:33.598 --> 51:34.891
Bianca...

51:36.434 --> 51:37.685
How are you?

51:38.811 --> 51:42.607
Is that for me, Bianca?
Thank you!

51:44.901 --> 51:48.530
Can Baxter get you two
something to drink from the kitchen?

51:58.748 --> 51:59.999
Lars?

52:03.586 --> 52:04.921
I'll have a beer.

52:06.798 --> 52:08.258
And for Bianca?

52:10.343 --> 52:11.719
She doesn't drink.

52:12.262 --> 52:15.598
She doesn't like it when I drink either,
but I'm just gonna have one.

52:18.977 --> 52:20.979
I can help you with your coats.

52:22.689 --> 52:26.150
Hi. This is Margo.
And this is Bianca.

52:26.776 --> 52:29.571
Hi. Hi, Bianca.

52:34.450 --> 52:37.328
I'm glad you sent around that memo.
I would have freaked.

52:38.037 --> 52:39.789
It's so bizarre.

52:40.540 --> 52:43.459
- It's a disorder.
- What a weirdo.

52:44.711 --> 52:45.879
Lars?

52:46.588 --> 52:50.341
Look at him. He's in love
with that slutty hunk of silicone.

52:50.758 --> 52:54.012
- Her name's Bianca.
- Does he have sex with her?

52:54.095 --> 52:56.055
Babe, that's what she's for.

52:57.765 --> 53:01.102
- So, I hear you guys
are getting married! - Yes! - No!

53:03.021 --> 53:04.063
Tickle fight!

53:14.157 --> 53:16.409
I would kill to have hair like hers.

53:16.492 --> 53:20.371
Oh, I'd cut it to here,
long in front, short in back.

53:21.122 --> 53:24.542
Lars would never let her cut it.
Guys and long hair...

53:27.045 --> 53:28.421
I don't care.

53:29.964 --> 53:32.509
However she likes it,
that's how I like it.

53:33.635 --> 53:35.220
That's my kind of guy.

53:37.263 --> 53:38.431
I need wine.

53:40.934 --> 53:42.101
I'll get it.

53:43.770 --> 53:47.106
- Anyone else?
- Oh, no. - No, thanks.

54:05.208 --> 54:06.459
Dude...

54:08.044 --> 54:10.964
Hey, Lars.
Bianca? Total babe.

54:12.715 --> 54:17.095
- Thanks. - The best thing is,
she doesn't know how hot she is.

54:17.387 --> 54:19.722
That's what you want in a woman.
They stay with you,

54:19.806 --> 54:22.267
'cause they don't know
they could get somebody better.

54:22.392 --> 54:24.018
You know what I'm saying?

54:25.144 --> 54:27.522
Is she flexible?

54:41.202 --> 54:42.328
Yes.

56:02.242 --> 56:03.701
Did you have fun?

56:14.045 --> 56:15.296
Yeah.

56:19.175 --> 56:20.969
I'm just happy, that's all.

56:30.228 --> 56:33.857
And so he solaced himself
with pacing up and down the meadow

56:33.940 --> 56:36.609
and writing and carving
on the bark of the trees

56:36.693 --> 56:39.320
and on the fine sand
a multitude of verses,

56:39.487 --> 56:43.783
all in harmony with his sadness.
In sum and praise of Dulcinea.

57:03.845 --> 57:05.513
But what distressed him greatly

57:05.597 --> 57:08.391
was not having another hermit there
to confess him.

57:36.336 --> 57:37.670
Pain?

57:38.546 --> 57:39.797
That's okay.

57:40.632 --> 57:42.592
That's okay.
I can take that.

57:45.678 --> 57:48.348
You must be excited
about a baby on the way.

57:52.143 --> 57:53.978
Don't you want to be an uncle?

57:58.024 --> 57:59.609
Yeah...

58:04.197 --> 58:07.242
- Do you ever wanna be a mom?
- I don't know.

58:17.585 --> 58:18.920
Yes.

58:23.299 --> 58:25.927
But I'm not able
to have children of my own.

58:28.847 --> 58:31.057
Oh, that's too bad.

58:42.026 --> 58:43.987
Bianca's like that, actually.

58:50.785 --> 58:52.996
She can't have babies, either.

58:53.913 --> 58:55.290
That's a shame.

58:57.041 --> 58:59.836
When she was a baby,
her mom died in the middle of things

58:59.919 --> 59:01.963
when she was being born.

59:03.214 --> 59:04.674
Like yours.

59:06.759 --> 59:08.553
You have a lot in common.

59:17.937 --> 59:22.859
Lars, you know we've learned a lot
since then.

59:23.151 --> 59:26.821
- Things are better.
- But it could still happen, right?

59:26.905 --> 59:29.824
It's highly unlikely. It's

59:31.201 --> 59:33.578
rare.
- Yeah, but it still could.

59:38.208 --> 59:40.585
Lars, just take a breath.

59:46.966 --> 59:48.343
That's okay.

59:49.886 --> 59:51.137
I'm sorry.

59:52.639 --> 59:55.141
I'm sorry.
It's just so dangerous.

59:55.725 --> 59:58.478
- I don't like to think about it.
- Lars, sit down.

59:58.561 --> 01:00:00.188
Put your head between your knees.

01:00:00.271 --> 01:00:02.899
Put your head between your knees.
Sit down.

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:08.029
Just put your head
between your knees. Bend over.

01:00:08.488 --> 01:00:10.365
Okay. Okay.

01:00:11.324 --> 01:00:12.575
Okay.

01:00:14.369 --> 01:00:17.997
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Take a breath.

01:00:28.883 --> 01:00:32.554
We should get cell phones.

01:00:33.304 --> 01:00:36.808
Then we can call each other
whenever we want.

01:00:48.528 --> 01:00:52.866
How about afternoons,
Mondays and Wednesdays,

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:54.909
and then maybe all day Saturday?

01:01:02.834 --> 01:01:04.794
Yeah? You sure?

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:07.755
Okay!
Bianca, is that okay with you?

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:13.052
Bianca wants to volunteer
at the hospital on Thursday afternoons.

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:15.972
You do?

01:01:17.015 --> 01:01:19.100
What about your blood pressure?

01:01:19.851 --> 01:01:24.022
Just think of all the bald children.
Wouldn't they love her?

01:01:24.772 --> 01:01:26.316
That's true.

01:01:26.566 --> 01:01:29.819
A little bit of layering here
and some texture right there.

01:01:29.903 --> 01:01:32.572
And I don't know
what you guys think, but...

01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:38.203
- Bangs?
- I like that. - That's pretty.

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:42.790
Are you sure?
Because it's not growing back, right?

01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:49.881
"What's That Sound?"
by Veronica Charles.

01:01:50.298 --> 01:01:53.760
- I hear the telephone.
- Ring! Ring!

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:32.048
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:39.681 --> 01:02:41.975
He's not gonna get any better, is he?

01:02:45.311 --> 01:02:47.522
No, probably not.

01:02:50.149 --> 01:02:52.026
He's gonna love that thing

01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:58.074
his whole life,
and it's all my fault.

01:03:00.994 --> 01:03:02.996
No, it's not.

01:03:04.164 --> 01:03:05.707
I don't know.

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:12.714
I mean, I left home
as fast as I could. You know?

01:03:15.133 --> 01:03:17.218
I never thought about him.

01:03:17.635 --> 01:03:21.681
Then the two of us
move back here all fat and happy,

01:03:22.015 --> 01:03:25.685
and he moves into the goddamn garage
like the family dog.

01:03:27.145 --> 01:03:30.064
And I let him.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:36.738
No wonder he goes
and orders a fiancé in a box.

01:03:40.492 --> 01:03:41.743
Come here.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:07.435
There was this pair of... Benji?

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.271
- Oh, Basenjis?
- Basenjis!

01:04:10.688 --> 01:04:12.899
Yes, there were these two Basenjis.

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.902
They don't bark at all.

01:04:41.886 --> 01:04:43.137
Hello!

01:04:51.479 --> 01:04:52.647
Bianca!

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.858
We're upstairs!

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.031
What's going on?

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:05.410
It's the hospital volunteer banquet
at the VFW.

01:05:05.618 --> 01:05:09.038
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- She does. She looks beautiful!

01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:13.376
Because...

01:05:15.587 --> 01:05:17.755
We were supposed to play Scrabble.

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:19.966
Are you sure?

01:05:20.425 --> 01:05:21.426
Yeah.

01:05:21.509 --> 01:05:24.137
Her schedule's on the refrigerator.
Did you check?

01:05:25.513 --> 01:05:28.224
No, I didn't. I forgot.

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:35.440
Could I have a moment
alone with her, please?

01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:41.404
Thank you.

01:05:42.697 --> 01:05:43.781
Thank you.

01:05:50.163 --> 01:05:51.498
You're my girlfriend!

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:56.085
I shouldn't have to check a schedule
to see when you make a plan!

01:05:57.045 --> 01:05:59.047
You have 10 people
around you all the time!

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:01.466
You can't ask one of them
to call me and let me know?

01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:05.428
- They never fight. - At work I get
excited about playing Scrabble...

01:06:05.512 --> 01:06:07.180
I don't like his tone.

01:06:13.394 --> 01:06:14.896
Now, you listen to me.

01:06:14.979 --> 01:06:17.148
Bianca has a life of her own.

01:06:17.232 --> 01:06:19.943
No self-respecting woman
is gonna be at your beck and call!

01:06:20.026 --> 01:06:21.653
The sooner you learn that, the better.

01:06:21.736 --> 01:06:24.364
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah, you're away
at your job all day.

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:28.409
What's she supposed to do? Wait for you?
Would you do that for her?

01:06:28.493 --> 01:06:30.245
Would she even ask you to?

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:35.083
She's out in the community doing
things for others less fortunate.

01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:37.961
- You should be proud of her.
- What about me?

01:06:38.336 --> 01:06:41.965
Big baby.
He's just like my husband!

01:06:43.216 --> 01:06:44.676
She'll be home at 11.

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:05.947
She's my girlfriend and I shouldn't
have to check a schedule to see her!

01:07:10.285 --> 01:07:11.536
Are you okay?

01:07:13.746 --> 01:07:16.249
How would she feel if I just left her?

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:23.131
- What if I abandoned her? - She didn't
abandon you. She'll be back.

01:07:24.799 --> 01:07:26.593
How do I know that?

01:07:28.887 --> 01:07:31.472
People do whatever they want.

01:07:32.974 --> 01:07:37.353
- They don't care.
- No, we all care. Lars, we do care.

01:07:39.647 --> 01:07:40.773
No, you don't.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:46.738
That is...
That is just not true! God!

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:50.450
Every person in this town

01:07:50.658 --> 01:07:53.953
bends over backwards
to make Bianca feel at home.

01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:57.624
Why do you think
she has so many places to go

01:07:57.832 --> 01:07:59.334
and so much to do?

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:04.339
- I don't know.
- Because of you!

01:08:04.756 --> 01:08:08.343
Because all these people love you!

01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:12.180
We push her wheelchair,
we drive her to work,

01:08:12.347 --> 01:08:16.975
we drive her home,
we wash her, we dress her,

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:21.564
we get her up,
we put her to bed, we carry her!

01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:26.819
And she is not petite, Lars!
Bianca is a big, big girl!

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:32.742
None of this is easy for any of us,
but we do it!

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:37.538
God, we do it for you!

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:44.462
So don't you dare tell me
how we don't care!

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.729
I think it's the person's job
who's upset, to say they're upset,

01:09:02.814 --> 01:09:04.439
because they cannot, you know...

01:09:04.524 --> 01:09:06.234
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

01:09:06.568 --> 01:09:08.736
- Hey!
- How was the game?

01:09:11.072 --> 01:09:13.867
The cheese inspectors
beat the crap out of us.

01:09:14.408 --> 01:09:18.037
Is everything all right?
I usually put Bianca to bed.

01:09:18.328 --> 01:09:19.330
I know.

01:09:21.416 --> 01:09:23.501
Okay, tell him.

01:09:24.002 --> 01:09:26.296
We wanted
to talk to you about that.

01:09:30.841 --> 01:09:33.720
You don't have to do that anymore.
I'm gonna do that.

01:09:34.179 --> 01:09:36.264
Are you sure?
Because I don't mind.

01:09:36.346 --> 01:09:37.765
I thought that you...

01:09:38.683 --> 01:09:39.725
Sorry.

01:09:40.768 --> 01:09:45.356
- It's just been one of those days.
- It's... It's fine.

01:09:46.608 --> 01:09:48.318
It's up to you.

01:09:48.902 --> 01:09:53.948
- I'll leave you guys.
- Hey, Gus?

01:09:55.158 --> 01:09:57.327
- What's that?
- Thank you, though.

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:01.164
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, you did.

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.293
Okay.

01:10:09.797 --> 01:10:11.049
I'm tired.

01:10:18.473 --> 01:10:21.184
- Did I miss something?
- We had a big fight!

01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:22.769
- Really?
- Yes!

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:37.200
Are those hand knit mittens?

01:10:37.784 --> 01:10:39.744
I think it's kind of cold out.

01:10:45.124 --> 01:10:48.169
- Lars, have you met Erik?
- Not officially.

01:10:48.837 --> 01:10:50.547
You're famous around here.

01:10:52.632 --> 01:10:53.800
I know.

01:10:54.634 --> 01:10:56.261
Hell of a grip too, pal.

01:10:58.388 --> 01:10:59.514
Yeah.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.002
Yes?

01:11:42.015 --> 01:11:46.519
- My office.
- I think I'm gonna stay.

01:11:47.896 --> 01:11:50.023
She's feeling pretty lousy today.

01:11:52.358 --> 01:11:53.943
We'll both stay.

01:12:02.702 --> 01:12:05.330
I asked her to marry me last week.

01:12:10.418 --> 01:12:12.128
Congratulations!

01:12:14.005 --> 01:12:15.548
When's the happy day?

01:12:16.299 --> 01:12:17.759
She said no.

01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:23.806
I know. I couldn't believe it.

01:12:26.726 --> 01:12:28.228
Yeah.

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:39.531
Stop it! You have no right
to talk to me like that!

01:12:39.697 --> 01:12:40.907
No, you don't!

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:43.243
You don't.
I don't talk to you like that!

01:12:58.258 --> 01:13:00.009
Have you stopped yelling?

01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:41.968
I was talking to Bianca

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:45.930
and she was saying that, in her culture,
they have these rites of passages

01:13:46.014 --> 01:13:48.558
and rituals and ceremonies...

01:13:49.267 --> 01:13:51.644
Just all kinds of things
that when you do them,

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:53.730
or when you're done,
if you live through them,

01:13:53.813 --> 01:13:55.565
they'll let you know
you're an adult.

01:13:57.025 --> 01:13:58.693
Doesn't that sound great?

01:13:59.611 --> 01:14:00.987
It does.

01:14:02.447 --> 01:14:05.158
- How did you know?
- How did I know what?

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:07.035
That you were a man.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:11.539
I couldn't tell you.

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:15.793
Was it...

01:14:16.377 --> 01:14:17.921
Was it sex?

01:14:26.304 --> 01:14:28.056
Yeah, you know...

01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:29.974
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of...

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:35.063
No. Well, it's kind of sex,
but it's not, you know?

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.440
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:14:37.774 --> 01:14:39.943
It's a good question.

01:14:40.818 --> 01:14:42.487
Yeah, but I have to know.

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:45.490
Hold that thought.

01:14:57.502 --> 01:15:00.296
- You should ask Dagmar.
- I did ask Dagmar.

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:02.173
She said I should ask you.

01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:09.347
- I can only give you my opinion.
- That's all I want.

01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:11.724
It's not like
you're all one thing or the other.

01:15:11.808 --> 01:15:13.393
There's still a kid inside.

01:15:13.476 --> 01:15:16.312
But you grow up
when you decide to do right.

01:15:16.396 --> 01:15:19.357
Not what's right for you;
what's right for everybody.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.526
Even when it hurts.

01:15:23.403 --> 01:15:25.071
Okay. Like, what?

01:15:28.408 --> 01:15:29.492
Like...

01:15:30.743 --> 01:15:36.332
Like you don't jerk people around,
and you don't cheat on your woman,

01:15:36.416 --> 01:15:39.961
and you take care of your family.
You admit when you're wrong.

01:15:40.128 --> 01:15:41.880
You try to, anyways.

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:45.675
That's all I can think of.

01:15:46.259 --> 01:15:48.845
It sounds like it's easy and,
for some reason, it's not.

01:15:48.928 --> 01:15:52.348
- I know, because nothing's easy.
- It's like the old man.

01:15:52.432 --> 01:15:54.642
He didn't have
to take care of 2 kids alone.

01:15:54.726 --> 01:15:57.937
He could have given us to an orphanage.
People do that.

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:01.691
But he loved us and tried to do right,
even though he didn't know how

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:04.235
and even though
he had a broken heart.

01:16:14.746 --> 01:16:16.915
I shouldn't have left you
alone with him.

01:16:17.165 --> 01:16:20.627
He was too sad.
It scared me and I just...

01:16:21.961 --> 01:16:23.338
I just ran.

01:16:27.008 --> 01:16:28.468
That was selfish

01:16:30.762 --> 01:16:32.222
and I'm sorry.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.811
That's okay.

01:16:42.982 --> 01:16:44.025
Okay.

01:16:49.364 --> 01:16:50.949
You've crossed the line!

01:16:51.324 --> 01:16:55.453
- You kept swiping my action figures.
- I hide them! I don't hang them!

01:16:55.537 --> 01:16:58.373
Whatever, you're too old
for that thing, anyway. Okay?

01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:02.377
- Take off the noose.
- No. - Take it off!

01:17:02.836 --> 01:17:06.381
Face it, Margo! The bear is dead.
Okay? Burn on you!

01:17:14.055 --> 01:17:15.181
I warned her.

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:35.660
It's not just the bear.

01:17:37.036 --> 01:17:38.705
I broke up with Erik.

01:17:46.713 --> 01:17:48.256
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.719
Yeah, I didn't even
have a good reason.

01:17:53.303 --> 01:17:55.513
He just wasn't very interesting.

01:18:06.107 --> 01:18:08.026
Then why was he your boyfriend?

01:18:11.863 --> 01:18:13.531
I get lonely.

01:18:16.576 --> 01:18:18.536
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:38.389
Thank you.

01:18:39.349 --> 01:18:40.475
Sure.

01:18:43.895 --> 01:18:46.356
Hey, what are you doing
on Friday night?

01:18:49.776 --> 01:18:55.198
I have a School Board meeting.
Bianca got elected, so...

01:18:56.991 --> 01:18:59.577
- That's great!
- Yeah. - Yeah.

01:19:03.373 --> 01:19:04.499
Okay.

01:19:07.126 --> 01:19:08.294
Why?

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:13.258
I was just thinking that maybe
we could all go out sometime.

01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:19.973
- Never mind.
- After I drop off Bianca, I'm free.

01:19:20.473 --> 01:19:22.684
But just me, so...

01:19:27.564 --> 01:19:29.274
That would be great, Lars!

01:19:30.942 --> 01:19:32.193
Thank you.

01:19:35.613 --> 01:19:36.781
Okay.

01:19:59.762 --> 01:20:01.014
Nice shot.

01:20:26.372 --> 01:20:29.000
You're putting
too much spin on the ball.

01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:30.251
I know.

01:20:36.591 --> 01:20:39.677
Sorry, we're full up. Next week's
the Ladies League Tournament.

01:20:39.761 --> 01:20:42.388
- Nada? - Dude!
- Tell them lady go.

01:20:42.472 --> 01:20:44.474
No way, Nelson,
they'll shred me.

01:20:45.934 --> 01:20:47.268
Is that Lars?

01:20:49.687 --> 01:20:53.650
- Hey, buddy!
- We're full. - No problema!

01:20:58.404 --> 01:21:02.033
- I kicked your butt.
- No, no, I'll kick your butt!

01:21:06.496 --> 01:21:08.373
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:22:26.451 --> 01:22:31.789
This was exactly what I needed.
Things look so much better!

01:22:33.041 --> 01:22:35.627
Thanks for going bowling with me, Lars.

01:22:44.344 --> 01:22:45.678
I don't...

01:22:54.020 --> 01:23:01.027
I don't want to give you
the wrong idea about this.

01:23:03.988 --> 01:23:09.077
It's just,
I never could cheat on Bianca, ever.

01:23:09.494 --> 01:23:11.704
Oh! No!

01:23:12.455 --> 01:23:16.167
Oh, my God,
I hope you didn't think that, Lars.

01:23:16.793 --> 01:23:18.294
I would never do that.

01:23:28.721 --> 01:23:30.390
I would never do that.

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:37.188
Oh, okay, good. Yeah.

01:23:37.397 --> 01:23:41.442
Because a man doesn't cheat
on his woman, and that's that.

01:23:42.527 --> 01:23:45.029
Absolutely. And vice versa.

01:23:45.864 --> 01:23:49.617
Besides, I don't mean
to steal anybody's boyfriend.

01:23:50.368 --> 01:23:52.704
One day,
I'll find a man of my own and

01:23:54.914 --> 01:23:56.332
we'll be happy, too.

01:23:59.711 --> 01:24:01.963
That's the way it works, I guess.

01:24:20.356 --> 01:24:21.649
Thanks.

01:24:25.487 --> 01:24:26.946
Snow!

01:24:33.203 --> 01:24:35.413
I was hoping that winter was over.

01:24:36.581 --> 01:24:40.585
No, it's a thaw.
Winter isn't over till Easter.

01:24:48.593 --> 01:24:49.969
Thanks again.

01:24:51.429 --> 01:24:52.555
Hey.

01:25:19.624 --> 01:25:21.084
Goodnight, Lars.

01:25:40.395 --> 01:25:43.273
I'm not sure how well
these treatments are working.

01:25:43.523 --> 01:25:44.816
No?

01:25:49.487 --> 01:25:50.947
What do you think?

01:25:52.949 --> 01:25:54.409
I don't know.

01:26:01.416 --> 01:26:02.667
I'm sorry.

01:26:13.011 --> 01:26:15.722
I don't know.
It's hard, because

01:26:18.099 --> 01:26:20.852
I know that she loves me, but

01:26:21.019 --> 01:26:23.479
I ask her to marry me
and she says: "No".

01:26:26.566 --> 01:26:28.443
Or she says: "l don't know".

01:26:31.404 --> 01:26:33.281
Or she doesn't say anything.

01:26:38.703 --> 01:26:40.163
Nothing?

01:26:47.921 --> 01:26:54.719
When I was a child, I spoke
as a child. I understood as a child.

01:27:11.152 --> 01:27:12.278
Hey...

01:27:58.783 --> 01:28:00.368
Wake up!

01:28:00.785 --> 01:28:02.162
Wake up!

01:28:06.166 --> 01:28:07.542
She won't wake up.

01:28:08.126 --> 01:28:12.463
- Bianca! I think she's unconscious!
- Are you sure? - Look at me. Bianca?

01:28:12.881 --> 01:28:15.383
Hey, hey, hey!

01:28:15.675 --> 01:28:18.094
- Bianca's unconscious!
- Can you hear me?

01:28:18.178 --> 01:28:19.345
Bianca!

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:23.391
Wake up!

01:28:23.474 --> 01:28:26.769
Hey, she looks alright!
She looks alright!

01:28:26.936 --> 01:28:29.606
- Hey, hey!
- Call 911! - Okay.

01:28:33.401 --> 01:28:37.989
- 911? - I don't know! You always
expect me to know what to do!

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:49.709
They're here.
Call Doctor Berman.

01:28:49.792 --> 01:28:51.794
#...you look at me,#

01:28:51.878 --> 01:28:54.923
#O is for the only one I see,#

01:28:55.131 --> 01:28:58.468
#V is very, very extraordinary,#

01:28:58.676 --> 01:29:01.804
#E is even more than anyone...#

01:29:01.971 --> 01:29:04.098
I'm sorry,
you'll have to wait out here.

01:29:04.182 --> 01:29:05.767
#...that you adore.#

01:29:06.768 --> 01:29:08.937
It's okay.
The doctor's on the way.

01:29:10.563 --> 01:29:12.565
Hello? Hello?

01:29:12.732 --> 01:29:14.651
- Lars!
- Yeah.

01:29:25.829 --> 01:29:26.955
What?

01:29:30.333 --> 01:29:31.459
What?

01:29:32.627 --> 01:29:34.379
Bianca's very sick.

01:29:36.589 --> 01:29:39.634
No, she's not.
Come on, she's not sick.

01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:41.719
She's not! Lars?

01:29:44.889 --> 01:29:46.015
She's dying.

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.060
- But...
- God!

01:29:49.811 --> 01:29:52.689
We're gonna keep her here
till she's stable, but

01:29:53.314 --> 01:29:55.608
she wants to go home
with Lars tonight.

01:29:56.109 --> 01:29:57.652
- Can I see her?
- Sure.

01:30:22.427 --> 01:30:23.595
What?

01:30:44.282 --> 01:30:47.368
I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.

01:30:47.494 --> 01:30:51.456
What's this gonna do to him?
How could you let this happen?

01:30:51.664 --> 01:30:56.169
I'm not letting it happen, it's Lars.
It's always been Lars.

01:30:57.212 --> 01:31:01.424
He's making the decisions.
He's the one who found her unconscious;

01:31:01.633 --> 01:31:03.885
he's the one who said she's dying.

01:31:17.482 --> 01:31:19.150
Are you okay back there?

01:31:19.984 --> 01:31:22.695
They gave her something,
so she's asleep.

01:31:24.447 --> 01:31:26.157
Anything you want, Lars?

01:31:31.996 --> 01:31:34.666
We're gonna stay together
in the pink room tonight.

01:33:21.564 --> 01:33:26.152
Come down to the family room, Lars.
Let Bianca rest.

01:33:35.245 --> 01:33:37.539
We sent Gus and Karin to the movies.

01:33:38.706 --> 01:33:40.667
They didn't want to leave you.

01:33:46.756 --> 01:33:50.510
No, I'm glad...
I'm glad they left.

01:33:50.927 --> 01:33:54.597
I feel terrible that all this is
happening so close to the baby coming.

01:33:54.681 --> 01:33:58.059
That's how life is, Lars.
Everything at once.

01:33:58.476 --> 01:34:00.145
We brought casseroles.

01:34:01.938 --> 01:34:03.189
Thank you.

01:34:10.947 --> 01:34:13.825
Is there something
I should be doing right now?

01:34:14.033 --> 01:34:16.452
- No, dear.
- You eat.

01:34:18.204 --> 01:34:19.706
We came over to sit.

01:34:20.206 --> 01:34:22.750
That's what people do
when tragedy strikes.

01:34:22.917 --> 01:34:24.586
They come over and sit.

01:34:26.087 --> 01:34:27.213
Okay.

01:34:30.758 --> 01:34:32.760
Don't you feel a little better?

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.992
I got spring fever, we're going
to the lake. You wanna come?

01:35:04.751 --> 01:35:07.462
Lars, why don't you come with us?

01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:09.547
It would do everybody good.

01:35:16.846 --> 01:35:18.306
Bianca?

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:21.559
Don't you wanna see
this beautiful day?

01:35:35.782 --> 01:35:38.785
- Is there a storm coming?
- The weather said no.

01:35:43.081 --> 01:35:44.958
Looks like a storm to me.

01:35:46.084 --> 01:35:50.296
Well, I need to stretch my legs.
Let's take a chance.

01:35:56.970 --> 01:35:58.137
Lars?

01:36:01.558 --> 01:36:03.434
We're gonna watch the water.

01:36:04.477 --> 01:36:09.482
- We won't be far.
- Holler if you need us. - Okay.

01:37:58.299 --> 01:38:02.220
- You think it's not that color?
- It doesn't match the curtains.

01:38:03.096 --> 01:38:06.766
- I think so. Here, just be careful.
- Okay.

01:38:14.482 --> 01:38:15.650
Gus...

01:38:18.945 --> 01:38:21.573
No. Don't run. Lars!

01:38:23.658 --> 01:38:24.826
Lars!

01:38:50.435 --> 01:38:57.192
Lars asked us not to wear black today.
He did so to remind us

01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.445
that this is no ordinary funeral.

01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:07.869
We are here to celebrate
Bianca's extraordinary life.

01:39:10.371 --> 01:39:13.500
From her wheelchair,
Bianca reached out

01:39:14.167 --> 01:39:15.710
and touched us all

01:39:16.377 --> 01:39:19.797
in ways
we could have never imagined.

01:39:21.883 --> 01:39:23.218
She was a teacher.

01:39:26.387 --> 01:39:29.265
She was a lesson in courage.

01:39:34.604 --> 01:39:36.397
And Bianca loved us all.

01:39:38.483 --> 01:39:39.943
Especially Lars.

01:39:43.404 --> 01:39:45.073
Especially him.

01:40:31.035 --> 01:40:32.412
Hi.

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:35.331
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry, I just...

01:40:36.791 --> 01:40:42.005
I don't know, it's just funerals
and mom and dad, you know.

01:40:49.762 --> 01:40:52.765
- He's unbelievable, huh?
- He is.

01:40:58.855 --> 01:41:02.066
I wanted to thank you for...

01:41:11.576 --> 01:41:12.619
Gus!

01:41:15.872 --> 01:41:16.915
Yeah.

01:41:20.043 --> 01:41:22.253
So, shall we see you at the house?

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.756
- Of course.
- Okay. - Sure.

01:41:54.869 --> 01:41:57.747
She asked me not to be sad,
but I can't help it.

01:42:01.626 --> 01:42:03.211
Yeah. Me neither.

01:42:06.881 --> 01:42:08.883
But it'll get better with time.

01:42:11.386 --> 01:42:13.680
That's what everyone keeps saying,
so...

01:42:15.765 --> 01:42:18.476
It's true, I think, in a way.

01:42:23.565 --> 01:42:25.900
But there'll never be
anybody like her.

01:42:49.382 --> 01:42:51.134
I suppose we should

01:42:53.136 --> 01:42:54.888
catch up with everyone.

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.189
Do you wanna take a walk?

01:43:06.608 --> 01:43:07.859
Yes.
