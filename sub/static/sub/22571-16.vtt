00:01.369 --> 00:02.736
- Those are Vans.

00:02.836 --> 00:04.372
- I don't know if you're cool
enough to wear Vans.

00:04.472 --> 00:05.839
Don't the cool kids wear Vans?

00:05.939 --> 00:07.208
- And the cool old people.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.477
- I've never heard
anybody say you were cool.

00:09.577 --> 00:10.711
Is he cool?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.646
- Vans are cool.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.048
- I mean,
he's cool in his own way.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.483
He doesn't give a crap.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.951
- Yeah. I'm so cool
they call me "cool-o."

00:19.820 --> 00:23.324
- I don't think that means
"cool" in Spanish, though.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.529
male narrator: When storage
units are abandoned--

00:28.629 --> 00:29.563
- Yo, look at this one!
- Whoo!

00:29.663 --> 00:30.864
- Nice one!

00:30.964 --> 00:32.333
narrator:
The treasures within...

00:32.433 --> 00:34.435
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.769
narrator:
Are put up for action.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.105
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:37.205 --> 00:38.606
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:38.706 --> 00:40.007
- You shut your face!

00:40.108 --> 00:42.510
- Aww, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.978
- We're back, baby!

00:45.079 --> 00:46.714
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

00:46.814 --> 00:49.217
- Today I'm headed to
Santa Ana to a vault auction.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.651
Right in my own backyard.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.220
You know, the bidding
can get more competitive

00:52.320 --> 00:53.521
in vault auctions.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.456
You have to be aggressive
and go after them.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.425
I think I'll make
it easier for everyone today

00:57.525 --> 00:59.460
and buy them all.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.697
- Hey, you're here, we get it.
Get a grip.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.099
- Keep going!

01:05.199 --> 01:06.967
- Just when you thought
everything was normal,

01:07.067 --> 01:08.469
then that comes in.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.805
- Whoo!

01:11.905 --> 01:13.741
Yeah, I made that, Ivy!

01:13.841 --> 01:16.344
- For Dan and Laura, actually.
This was my template.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.711
So that's on their wall.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.380
- That's going to be
a collector's item one day.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.714
But not to me.
- Yup, I should sign it.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.082
- Because that is artwork--

01:22.183 --> 01:23.951
Oh, my God!

01:25.986 --> 01:27.421
- I wanted to make sure

01:27.521 --> 01:30.291
that I got off on the right
foot with everybody today.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.025
- Crazy old man
just stepped on it.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.228
- I'd like to step on his face.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.164
- All right, welcome to 21st
Century Moving and Storage.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.698
We're Dan and Laura Dotson,
American auctioneers.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.932
Before you go
through these gates,

01:39.032 --> 01:40.033
you need to know
how it's going to work.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.402
- Folks,
we have ten units here.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.803
Yes, they are owned
by the same person,

01:42.903 --> 01:44.138
but we're going
to give everybody

01:44.238 --> 01:45.606
an opportunity to bid today.
That's right.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.007
We're selling each and every
one, single and separate.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.176
- We're going
to go to the vault.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.177
We're going
to remove the door.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.478
We're going to give you

01:50.578 --> 01:52.045
about five minutes
to take a look around.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.414
And then who's ever got the
most money can own it today.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.415
Are you ready

01:56.184 --> 01:57.285
- Tell 'em, folks!

01:57.385 --> 01:58.586
- So I want
to start off with a bang.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.621
- Bang, okay.
- Like, guaranteed money.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.823
- It is auction time!
- Competition, begin.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.392
*

02:04.492 --> 02:08.095
- Whoo! There we are!
It's auction time!

02:08.196 --> 02:10.964
- Remember, if there's
bubble wrap, it's not crap.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.966
- Skeleton here
looking right at me, bruh.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.235
Unbelievable.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.404
There's a lot of voodoo bones
in this unit.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.306
I wish I had my beads with me.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.773
- I see
a couple of chairs here.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.141
- And some boxes.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.877
- That's clean, so I'll see
how the bidding goes.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.514
Or a TV stand?

02:26.614 --> 02:29.016
That could be an HDTV, which
could be money right there.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.551
- And if you're ready to go,
we're ready to go,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.286
we're going to go right now,
this is number one of ten.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.622
Which one of you is going to
pay? I'm going to bid 25.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.391
- Tell 'em, tell 'em, yeah.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.659
- Yes!
- Mmm, I don't know.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.028
Once, twice, 35 bucks?

02:41.128 --> 02:42.630
- Yup
- 45!

02:42.730 --> 02:43.897
- We have Mary bidding!

02:45.599 --> 02:47.301
55, going 65, going 75 now.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.337
75, going to 85 now.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.372
We're going once,
at 95, we're going twice,

02:51.472 --> 02:53.874
Final call at 95 dollars--
- Yup!

02:53.974 --> 02:55.876
- Now we're moving to 105--
- Every time.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.178
- Sold that your way,
Dave's got it for $95.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.648
- That one was just a warm-up.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.050
- Whoo! All right!

03:03.150 --> 03:04.117
- I see a refrigerator.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.553
- Very normal little vault.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.087
Here we go, number 20,
what's your pleasure,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.922
what are you going to pay?
Say it, how much, how much.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.991
Give me number 25 on
the floor, number 25's there.

03:11.091 --> 03:14.161
35 going once, 35 going twice.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.929
- Yup!
- 35, looking for 45.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.533
- Cold-blooded.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.235
- Sold for that your way,
sir, for 45 dollars.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.304
What's your name?
- Saed, S-A-E-D.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.905
- Thank you.

03:25.005 --> 03:28.742
- All right, here we go.
Corner unit.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.511
That's right, folks!

03:30.611 --> 03:32.513
Okay, so there's
lots of boxes back there.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.248
That says
fragile, books, glass.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.516
I think that a lot of people

03:35.616 --> 03:36.917
are going to be
bidding on this unit.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.687
So it makes me nervous.
But I'm going to try.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.322
- Big old set
of truck tires in there.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.690
And a boom box.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.292
- See, it's something
I could probably sell.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.193
- I think we're going to have
to go to battle on this one.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.695
- Got you!

03:47.795 --> 03:49.330
All right, here we go, number
20, what's your pleasure.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.831
What are you going to pay? Say
it, say how much money, where?

03:50.931 --> 03:52.099
- Get out of here!
50, 50 to 75.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.201
Going to 75,
and we've got the 100 too.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.869
- Yup!
- Ivy!

03:55.969 --> 03:56.970
- I've got my eye on you.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.708
- Yup! Yup! Yup!

04:00.808 --> 04:02.142
- Try to get the bug gone.
Yup!

04:02.242 --> 04:03.877
- It's ok, it's ok.
Yup!

04:03.977 --> 04:05.513
- He's stuck!

04:05.613 --> 04:06.880
- Yup!

04:06.980 --> 04:09.249
- Mary, you're not tall enough
to buy this unit.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.718
- And 500. 500, 500.
- Whatever.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.786
- 550, now 600, and 700.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.488
- Yup!
- 700, now 750, 800.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.723
- Yup!
- 850, now 900.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.758
- You're too tall
to buy this unit, Ivy.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.192
- Got to know when
to hold them.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.929
- Sold that your way, Dave.
$850 dollars, Dave.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.997
- Who has two thumbs and loves
getting what he wants?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.366
This guy.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.604
I got a feeling they're only
going to get better.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.374
- Here you go! Whoo!

04:33.474 --> 04:35.042
500, and 600, and 650.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.043
- Yup!

04:36.143 --> 04:37.044
- 700
- 700 there.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.346
- Yup!
- 750 now.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.547
- 800.
- 800 going once,

04:39.647 --> 04:41.415
800 going twice,
last call for 800--

04:41.515 --> 04:43.116
- Yup!
- 825 there, now 850.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.386
- Whoo! Tell 'em, 850
- 850, I've got 825, need 850.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.655
- Wow.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.623
- Sold it your way,
$825 dollars, Dave.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.024
825. Next case, let's go!

04:51.124 --> 04:52.360
Bam!
- Whoo!

04:52.460 --> 04:54.294
- All right.
You're giving me 20, 20 bucks.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.464
Saed with the 30.
30 going once, 30 going twice--

04:56.564 --> 04:57.565
- Yup!
- You want to bid 30.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.899
You want to go
40 bucks on that?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.601
- Sold it your way, Dave.
You got it for $30.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.002
Lock it up, and here we go.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.539
- Saed said no.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.875
- Tell 'em, folks! Whoo!

05:07.975 --> 05:09.510
- I got 600, who wants to--
Yup!

05:09.610 --> 05:11.612
- He's already marked
his territory over there.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.813
- You got no chance.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.950
Sold it your way, Dave.
You got it for 700.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.386
- This is almost too easy.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.054
- Here we go.
- Whoo!

05:21.154 --> 05:22.956
- Oh, that's not a tired unit.
- Oh, wheels.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.558
- There's a lot
of tread in there.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.293
- Dave is just
buying them all up.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.496
So I'm not going
to waste my money.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.130
- This looks like we've got
a refrigerator here.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.199
- That's a soda pop machine,
huh?

05:32.299 --> 05:34.868
- 150 with the bid, 175,
going once, going twice.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.104
Last and final call,

05:37.204 --> 05:38.472
- Yup!

05:38.572 --> 05:40.140

Dave got it again.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.241
250, 250.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.210
250, going once,
275, going twice.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.445

05:53.086 --> 05:55.923
400, 400 bucks,
450, going twice.

05:56.023 --> 06:00.861
Last and final call
at 450 bucks for that.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.132
450 going once, going twice.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.400
Last and final call
at 450 bucks.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.635
- Yu-nope!

06:07.735 --> 06:09.803

06:09.903 --> 06:11.271
- I broke
your winning streak, Dave.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.074
Sup?

06:14.174 --> 06:15.342
- Good job, Ivy.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.343
Got you thinking.
- Here we go!

06:16.444 --> 06:18.412
And away she goes!

06:18.512 --> 06:19.647
825, 825.

last and final call for $1,000.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.797
, I got money too.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.566
- Yes.
- Yo.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.400
- That's the final call
at $75 today!

06:40.501 --> 06:42.035
- Nope!
- Hah!

06:42.135 --> 06:44.805
- Sold it your way,
$50 big bucks, Ivy.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.541
- That's the walk of shame,
brother.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.042
- Walk of success.
- That's the walk of shame,

06:49.142 --> 06:50.277
when you're done looking
through your unit.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.079
- Walk of success.
- The last unit, mayor.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.981
- Last unit, last chance,
let's make it happen

06:54.081 --> 06:55.483
here in Santa Ana, folks!

06:55.583 --> 06:57.518
- Dang it, we got to get one.
- I know.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.986
- Dave's been
buying them all up.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.253
- Yeah, we got to go
get that  together.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.355
- Jack up the price.
- Kumbaya.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.157
- I'm tired of
getting railroaded.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.860
It's time for Kenny and I
to jump on this train.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.530
- 400 bucks, 425, 425 going
once, 425 going twice,

07:09.630 --> 07:10.898
last and final call, my bad.
- Yup!

07:10.998 --> 07:13.433
450 now.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.635
- Frickin' Dave.
- 450, 475, 450 there, now 475.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.636
- Don't you
already have enough crap?

07:15.736 --> 07:16.904
That you already bought?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.539
- Tell 'em! Tell 'em now!

07:18.639 --> 07:21.308
- Yup!
Ain't no free rides here.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.611
,
575 going once,

07:23.711 --> 07:25.546
575 going twice,
last and final call.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.816
- Sold it your way,
$550 dollars, Mary.

07:28.916 --> 07:32.052
- Yes! There she goes.
Got her feet wet.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.387
- We finally got one.
Choo-choo!

07:35.989 --> 07:38.058
- That's it, folks, and don't
forget to pay the lady.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.392
God bless all of you.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.828
- Well, good thing I was here,

07:40.928 --> 07:41.995
or you would have got
all the good stuff.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.463
- I did get
all the good stuff, man.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.698
- Nah, you got
half of the good stuff.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.300
- Nah, I think
I got the better ones.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.906
*

07:53.006 --> 07:54.575
- I'm ready.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.009
- I need
a little extra help today.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.146
So I brought two of me--
me and my son, Ivy Jr.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.413
Let's just get everything out,

08:00.514 --> 08:03.283
line it up,
then we'll go through it.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.618
- This is kinda cool,
is it two

08:04.718 --> 08:06.554
- It is two-way.
- Hey, that's awesome.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.122
$250 bucks.
- Turn it this way.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.191
- That sucks. Trash.
- All right.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.227
- It's a Little Rascal
for old people.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.328
Might want to keep that.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.764
- Why,
you know some old people?

08:16.864 --> 08:19.399
- I live with one.
- Come on out, Little Rascal.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.368
I'll mob in this thing.

08:21.468 --> 08:24.872
- Yeah! Whoo!

08:24.972 --> 08:27.875
- Let's go to market, son,
and buy some prunes.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.878
- Whoo, I'm mobbing.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.681
Hey, why are you
watching me and not working?

08:33.781 --> 08:36.984
- Check this out.
- Whoo, put that down.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.452
It's not real,
but it is still awesome.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.988
- I actually,
really know what this is.

08:41.088 --> 08:41.989
- I do.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.124
It's just a big airsoft gun.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.160
- Call of Duty.
- Oh.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.629
How much is it worth?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.230
- That, fool.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.965
- Well, if the tip changes,
it's worth more. And it does.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.701
If we were playing residential,

08:53.801 --> 08:55.168
in the back of
somebody's yard,

08:55.268 --> 08:57.470
we'd need the orange one,
so the cops don't shoot us.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.839
- Put that thing down.
- Yeah.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.173
- By the way,
how much is it worth?

09:00.273 --> 09:02.342
- You could get $1,000,
easily to anybody.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.578
- To anybody.

09:04.678 --> 09:05.946
- We'll start here.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.482
40 here, that's got to be 300.
- I think so too.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.084
- Tables, 10 bucks a pair.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.187
I'll wear these--no, I won't.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.089
- Ten bucks.
- It's Superman!

09:16.189 --> 09:17.925
Old Superman!
- I know.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.727
- You could get 30 bucks
for it, on its own.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.728
both: Candy bowl!

09:20.828 --> 09:23.296
- Goofy! And Betty Boop.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.464
- Pretty good.
- That's a $100 box right here.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.367
- Bells. Cowboy boot.
- $30 box.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.169
- That's actually kinda heavy.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.004
- What are you, oh!
Welder stuff.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.405
Ah!
You're breaking the goggles.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.841
- I didn't know
there was goggles in here.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.343
- Got a oxygen acetylene
little thingys here.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.011
This might be
all my money right here.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.079
- Regulators, this says oxygen.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.280
- That thing goes
for over $2,800.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.514
- Yeah.
- Don't break it.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.549
I think this is worth money.
- Yeah.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.317
- Wrap that back up.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.386
Oh, cards, all sealed.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.921
Five bucks a pop, there's got
to be 300 bucks in there.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.122
- Oh, I agree.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.624
- Whole lot
of little sporting stuff.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.959
- Yeah.
- That's another hundred bucks.

09:52.059 --> 09:52.960
- Remember when Nana
had one of those?

09:53.060 --> 09:53.961
- Yeah.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.495
All right, one, two, three!

09:55.595 --> 09:56.496
This thing
is pretty comfortable.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.732
- Heck yeah,
I'm ready to take a nap.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.033
- You sink in a lot.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.268
I don't know
if it's because your weight,

10:01.368 --> 10:02.535
or just because
it's like that.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.838
, I took years
to get all this.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.406
Think I'll just
lose it right away?

10:06.506 --> 10:09.509
- No, but you could
at least, like, try.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.378
- Shoot.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.713
- You guys, sit down.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.547
- Hey, brah, you can't be
sleeping on the job.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.116
I know you did
all the work, brah.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.785
- Basically.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.921
Okay, come on, let's go, Kenny.
Don't worry about those guys.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.289
They're sitting there,
they're just wanting

10:22.389 --> 10:23.791
to see what we get.

10:23.891 --> 10:27.094
We only got one vault,
but maybe we got the best one.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.762
- Looks like this is
your type of stuff.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.131
- Handbags.
Freaking crusty bags.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.766
Maybe 10 bucks
for that whole box.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.368
- We can give that to him.
Next!

10:35.468 --> 10:36.603
This
keep falling out.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.906
- This stuff
is just baby stuff. Crap.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.274
Oh, some tennis rackets, Kenny.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.244
- Oh, it says Kennex!
Almost Kenny.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.913
- That's my cousin.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.881
Is there a tennis ball?
We can practice.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.382
- Okay.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.517
Let's see your swing, Kenny.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.685
- Yup.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.186
- Go.

10:53.286 --> 10:57.190
Why do you need two?
Just in case.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.692
- Oh, backhand.

10:58.792 --> 11:02.329
- You hit the ball so hard,
I couldn't even see it.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.598
- Oh, no,
I'll put an end to this.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.268
- Ivy, get out of our game!
You're messing it up.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.437
- Get to work.
Crap. Little kids.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.005
- How you going
to take the ball, brah?

11:12.105 --> 11:15.275
- Done took. Done took.
- Cold-blooded.

11:15.375 --> 11:19.346
Party pooper.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.814
- Let's keep
our eye on him, okay?

11:20.914 --> 11:22.115
, I keep
my eye on him all the time.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.352
- You the kinda kid my mama
said, "Don't play with,

11:25.452 --> 11:28.388
because all your stuff will
wind up in his bedroom."

11:28.488 --> 11:30.123
- Look at this,
they at the movie theatre.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.458
- There I am,
and there's Kenny.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.928
- I'd say this whole box
is worth about $100.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.596
- Trash.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.700
- No money! No crusty place.
We don't need no crusty place.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.203
- These are good
for games and stuff.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.838
How much you get?
- Maybe 10 bucks each.

11:44.938 --> 11:48.508
- No crusty place,
we don't need no crusty place.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.043
- Look at that ball, Kenny!
- Medicine ball.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.344
Oh!
- Yeah.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.313
- It's kinda heavy.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.748
But you get in shape
with that thing.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.884
- Everlast.
- Like you throw it.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.152
- That thing works pretty good.
- Oh!

11:59.252 --> 12:02.155
- Oof!
- Oh, watch your chest.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.657
- Oh. Okay, that's good.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.260
- Bag of clothes, nothing.
- Toss it.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.397
Sucks. Mary, clothes for you.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.466
- Hey, I was
giving those to you.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.703
- Right back at you.
- I know how to get you.

12:16.804 --> 12:20.974
- That's just mean, Ivy!

12:21.074 --> 12:22.742
You know I can't reach that.
- Next.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.012
- Hopefully there's not
really Mary Kay stuff in there.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.447
- We got some glass in here.
both: Oh!

12:27.547 --> 12:28.715
- Collectibles.
- Trinkets.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.517
Look at these bambinos!

12:31.819 --> 12:33.620
- There's lots
of shot glasses in here.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.488
50 bucks?
- Yeah, you right. Kumbaya.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.723
- Kenny!
- Virtual machine.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.458
- 3D adventure projector.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.727
This is worth like
100 bucks actually, this thing.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.029
both: Garage.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.798
Oh, cool! Kenny!
- Oh-ho.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.367
I bet Ivy knows all about this,
he used to be a boxer.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.836
- He looking at us, dude.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.204
- Hey, I can
see a couple losers.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.474
- Ivy, look. Boxing stuff.
- I'm looking.

12:54.574 --> 12:58.145
And here's the Trim Twister.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.413
- Look at that,
1959 training kit.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.949
- Ugh, this is hard.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.917
- Mmm, man, we might
have to get this checked out.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.819
It's been a while
since I've been to the gym,

13:05.919 --> 13:09.823
but if it's for some moneys,
sign me up. I think.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.392
- Clothes on hangers.

13:12.492 --> 13:16.429
- No. Trash closet. Ugh, more.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.465
- Hey, what you think
about the mattresses?

13:18.565 --> 13:21.501
- Crusty plush. I can't do
anything with that stuff.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.236
- We came up
a little bit short.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.073
- Sigh, okay, well I guess we
got to bank on, you know,

13:26.173 --> 13:27.440
that fitness equipment.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.744
As soon as Ivy and son
go over to the truck,

13:31.845 --> 13:33.346
we going to bring
some of that stuff over there,

13:33.446 --> 13:34.347
so we don't
have to carry it.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.648
- Okay.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.985
- Look, uno, dos, tres. Go.
- Oh, yes.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.821
- Let's take the big box.
- Ready, go.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.156
Down.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.995
*

13:48.095 --> 13:50.530
- I spent
$2,500 bucks on these crates,

13:50.630 --> 13:52.966
so hopefully, I pull
more than that out of them.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.467
All right, Jose.
Let's get to work, man.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.502
Let's put it
right over here though,

13:55.602 --> 13:56.736
so we don't
screw it up.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.638
Lay the furniture
up here against the wall,

13:58.738 --> 14:00.007
We're going to
make one big pile here,

14:00.107 --> 14:01.909
at the end,
and just pile it all up.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.346
- I'm not very impressed
with the furniture,

14:06.446 --> 14:08.481
to say the least.
$100 worth of furniture.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.518
$200 bike, we got a $300 hood.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.821
55 inch.
There it is, all wrapped up.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.856
We'll call that $200.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.893
Halloween, $20.
$10 lamp.

14:19.993 --> 14:23.730
Some silver,
we'll call that $30.

14:23.830 --> 14:27.267
$25 there,
we've got the nice dishes, $40.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.902
Oh, this is brand new,
unbanded.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.238
I don't even have to unband it,
I can sell it new in box.

14:31.338 --> 14:35.175
I'll get $125 for it.
Somebody really into Halloween.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.876
Oh, yeah,
look at that cool skull.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.845
Post these around the house.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.949
So we've got Darrell,
we've got Rene,

14:42.049 --> 14:43.516
we've got Brandi and Jared.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.987
Dan and Laura, Mary and Ivy.
Huh, I like it.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.122
I imagine those are, like,
50 bucks a piece.

14:49.222 --> 14:53.726
PS3, 50 bucks.
$10 patio table.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.629
We've got a $25 dining room
table; the legs are inside.

14:56.729 --> 15:00.233
We've got a $20 chair,
$10 chair, $10 plant,

15:00.333 --> 15:04.337
$10 plant, $20 vacuum,
$20 worth of skeleton.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.874
What's this? Voodoo tactical,
there we go, man.

15:07.975 --> 15:11.044
Damn!
!

15:11.144 --> 15:13.013
This is airsoft, with all these
little wires hanging out.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.514
But these are very cool,
look at that.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.949
If these guns were real,

15:16.049 --> 15:17.884
I'd have to report
them to the authorities.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.787
But since they're fake, I only
have to report them as income.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.389
Now we got all the handguns.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.791
I think there's two grand easy
here in airsoft stuff.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.926
Okay, we're getting out there,
, now I'm motivated.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.095
I feel like working.

15:28.195 --> 15:31.531
African statues, et cetera.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.400
These are actually
pretty nice figurines.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.368
I can say these
are like $25 bucks.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.669
Couple hundred on that one,

15:36.769 --> 15:38.505
at least a
couple hundred on this one.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.707
Eh, got a hundred dollars
in jackets in here.

15:40.807 --> 15:44.077
An old Mac computer,
50 bucks, at least.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.280
Another $200 statue.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.816
Damn good pottery,
it's made out of steel.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.451
40 bucks for that pair.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.021
Oh, a Harman/Kardon stereo,
40 bucks.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.456
Oh, DVD world.
A lot of them are sealed.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.025
Couple hundred dollars in DVDs.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.461
Got a bunch of ceramic that's
all wrapped up in here.

16:01.561 --> 16:05.898
Fifty bucks here.
Oh, a nice Keurig, 50 bucks.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.601
Betty Boop collectibles.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.838
Oh, these are all packaged
in the box and everything.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.706
You know, there's a couple
hundred bucks in that box.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.909
That's a pop-up tent,
75 bucks.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.945
Nice rims, SVT rims.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.080
Looks like
a hundred bucks there.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.614
And I forgot the tires,

16:21.714 --> 16:24.184
that are probably worth
about $300 bucks for the set.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.885
Love making money.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.587
Get this  loaded up,
man, get to work.

16:27.687 --> 16:32.425
- All right, man.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.961
- I'm visiti Cathy Milligan
at the Glass Studio.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.030
- Oh, hey, Ivy.
- I figured you were back here.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.499
I hope she gets fired up
about this torch I found.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.234
Got some weightlifting
equipment right here.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.271
- Oh, wow, wow, that's nice.
Two wows?

16:44.371 --> 16:45.905
- Yeah, I mean,
it's a glass torch,

16:46.005 --> 16:47.974
technology torch, and it's big.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.076
- I like when
somebody says "Wow, wow"

16:49.176 --> 16:51.044
when I bring something.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.446
Okay, let's check this out.
We can hook them up.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.248
We've got the
green ones for the oxygen,

16:55.348 --> 16:57.284
and the red ones
for the propane.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.252
*

16:59.352 --> 17:01.054
Okay, so we've got
all this hooked up.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.956
Let's light it up.
Put those glasses on first.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.160
- Shoot, I came here ready.
- Ah, look at those.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.296
It's melting glass time.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.464
Three, two, one.
- Well, okay, no, no, no.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.665
We've got to do this right.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.334
You got to do propane,
then you strike,

17:14.434 --> 17:16.436
and then you add the oxygen.
It's called POOP.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.837
- I did say poop.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.508
- Propane, oxygen,
then oxygen, propane.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.510
Okay, use your striker.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.478
- Fore!
- Mmmmmm.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.913
One more time.
- Three, two, one.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.515
Ready?
- Go for it.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.483
Whoo!
- I love fire.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.623
- It's probably
over 2000 degrees.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.924
- Whoo!

17:38.024 --> 17:39.392
- You've got yourself
a nice torch here.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.927
- All right,
that's good to hear.

17:41.027 --> 17:45.765
How much is it worth?
- Well, these tend to go for...

17:45.865 --> 17:47.900
*

17:48.000 --> 17:48.935
Fifteen.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.170
- Hundred.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.872
- Whoo!
Hey, I'm okay with that.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.341
- Excellent.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.775
- Oh, baby.

17:55.875 --> 17:56.843
- It's time to melt some glass.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.545
- Let's melt some glass.
- Mm-hmm.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.047
- I'm going to put these in.
- Whoo!

18:01.148 --> 18:02.582
- Okay,
see what I'm doing here?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.984
- Uh-huh.
- Heat that all up.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.354
Take it out.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.556
- Cable or rope or something.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.758
- Ta-da!
- Oh, that's cool!

18:11.858 --> 18:14.060
It's kinda like a candy cane.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.028
- A twisty.
Technical term.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.997
- Sounds like something
I would say.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.066
*

18:20.167 --> 18:22.101
- I'm so glad
that you're 80's festive, K.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.171
- I try, Mary.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.672
- You guys are
Mary and Kenny, huh?

18:25.772 --> 18:26.906
- Yeah.
- Yep.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.741
- Everything.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.377
- That's it.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.744
- We're at
the Training Hall gym

18:31.844 --> 18:33.045
to meet with Robert Oberst,

18:33.146 --> 18:36.549
who supposedly knows
a lot about gym equipment.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.085
Are you a bodybuilder?
- Oh, that's an insult.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.953
- Football--
Oh, it is an insult?

18:41.053 --> 18:42.355
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sorry.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.324
- What I do
is actually called strongman.

18:44.424 --> 18:47.194
We pull planes, and flip tires.
Airplanes?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.628
- Yes, ma'am.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.598
I have the American record
in the overhead press.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.666
And it was
just over 500 pounds.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.169
Technically, I have the
strongest shoulders in America.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.805
- Oh, my God.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.541
- We brought some of this
high-tech fitness equipment.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.809
We want you to
take a look at it.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.477
Let's start off with
this mega-heavy--

19:04.577 --> 19:06.713
This will be
like a doughnut to you.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.850
- This is
a very used medicine ball.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.985
- 1960s.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.187
both: All right.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.688
- Look at that.
- That is cool.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.725
This is, uh, just your average
old-school speed bag.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.994
It's not really a rare thing
to find one of these.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.930
- Let's go to something,
Mary, you know about.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.598
- The Trim Twist.
- The Trim Twist!

19:25.698 --> 19:26.799
You ever heard of that?
- Oh.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.134
It's really
a cool piece of equipment.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.802
A lot of people
who are into fitness

19:29.902 --> 19:31.170
and the history of it

19:31.271 --> 19:33.573
would really appreciate
something like this.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.741
- There you go,
you remember that?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.643
- Oh, this is cool!

19:36.743 --> 19:39.111
Oh, man, it's seen
some better days though.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.614
- The chest expander.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.882
It's bungee cords and a handle.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.751
But you could step
on the one end--

19:44.851 --> 19:48.721
- Yeah.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.623
- That kinda sounded like, pow!

19:50.723 --> 19:53.826
I ain't going to lie.
That was scary, America.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.329
- Last item.
- Oh, there we go.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.597
- There you go, I think that
this was for a caveman.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.567
- These look old.
These are like, 60s-ish.

20:00.667 --> 20:04.070
- So, how much do you think
we can get for everything?

20:04.170 --> 20:06.439
- You guys have some
really cool equipment here.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.675
You find somebody
who's looking for this stuff,

20:08.775 --> 20:11.511
I would guess you
could easily get about...

20:12.379 --> 20:13.580
$400.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.614
- Yes, nice!
- That's a beautiful number.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.483
I'll take it.
Kumbaya.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.717
Yeah, I'm going
straight to the buffet.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.785
- Yes, profit!
- Heck yeah!

20:18.885 --> 20:20.953
Can I come?
- Hell yeah!

20:21.053 --> 20:22.922
We going
to shut it down, for real!

20:23.022 --> 20:26.493
narrator: Dave Hester
got off on the right foot

20:26.593 --> 20:28.561
and bolted past
the competition,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.830
banking over $2,600.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.865
Ivy Calvin felt the heat,

20:32.965 --> 20:35.935
and turned up a profit
of $2200 bucks.

20:36.035 --> 20:41.708
While Mary and Kenny were only
able to pump out 130 pounds.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.910
- You guys want to play
with some of my toys?

20:44.010 --> 20:45.144
Think hamburgers.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.514
There we go,
throw it in your lap, oh!

20:47.614 --> 20:50.583
Too easy!

20:50.683 --> 20:52.084
I've got
the perfect exercise for you.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.353
- Okay.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.487
- Kenny, can you give me
a spot real quick?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.556
- I got you, brah.
- All right.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.593
Mary, you sweating bricks,
girl, you putting in that work.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.595
- Yep.
- Yeah, she's working hard.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.297
- Working hard over here.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.966
- That's it.
- Oh, my!
