00:46.648 --> 00:49.734
Being a policeman
is not what you see on TV.

00:49.943 --> 00:53.196
I've never had to pick between
the red and blue wires.

00:53.363 --> 00:58.534
Never seen a police car flip and cause
other cars to burst into flames.

00:58.743 --> 01:03.831
Never had to jump across rooftops.
I investigate crimes, track leads...

01:04.040 --> 01:09.796
...and sit in court. It's difficult,
tedious work, and you won't get rich.

01:10.004 --> 01:12.924
But I've done it for 28 years.

01:13.132 --> 01:17.553
I'm a detective. That's what I do.
If you break the law...

01:17.762 --> 01:21.849
...I'll do all I can to hunt you down
and put you behind bars.

01:23.518 --> 01:26.271
I won't say that I succeed every time.

01:26.479 --> 01:30.650
But I try to make sure that
if you do the crime, you'll do time.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.360
Any questions?

01:37.073 --> 01:41.411
Well, Detective Preston,
why don't you tell us about...

01:41.577 --> 01:44.038
...the lighter side of police work?

01:45.039 --> 01:47.375
You know. The fun days.

01:49.252 --> 01:52.463
I chased him over three roofs.
You can't do this!

01:52.672 --> 01:55.591
It's from the mayor.
You're a loose cannon.

01:55.758 --> 01:58.636
- You destroyed a city block!
- He fired first.

01:58.845 --> 02:00.221
I should read him his rights?

02:00.430 --> 02:06.769
- You should've called for backup.
- My only backup is in a hospital bed!

02:10.273 --> 02:15.111
His doctor called five minutes ago.
Jimmy didn't make it.

02:16.613 --> 02:17.614
Oh, God.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.912
Oh, God, no.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.707
No!

02:29.292 --> 02:32.295
- He was talking about getting out.
- It's hard.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.882
He was like a brother to me, captain.

02:36.090 --> 02:39.927
Since we was kids, we was partners.
We used to hang out...

02:40.136 --> 02:43.681
...and dream about
being on the force together.

02:43.890 --> 02:47.101
That was the dream.
Just two little Irish boys...

02:47.310 --> 02:51.189
...fighting, scrapping,
thinking about making a difference.

02:51.397 --> 02:53.441
God, I'm gonna miss him!

02:56.361 --> 02:59.656
I'll need your gun
and your shield, Pete.

03:06.829 --> 03:10.625
I may be off the force,
but I am not off this case!

03:11.167 --> 03:15.838
- That's not in the script.
- I just threw that in at the end.

03:16.047 --> 03:20.301
- I thought I should get the last line.
- Nailed it!

03:21.469 --> 03:23.972
Trey, it was great. Very believable.

03:24.180 --> 03:27.725
- But I'm not married to it.
- You can't fix perfect.

03:27.934 --> 03:29.644
We have imaginations.

03:29.936 --> 03:31.688
Thanks. We'll call you.

03:31.896 --> 03:34.232
- You got my number.
- Right here.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.776
- Moved to tears. Bye-bye.
- Take care.

03:36.985 --> 03:38.987
- You too.
- Restroom on the left.

03:39.279 --> 03:42.699
- Don't give up the day job.
- Unless it's acting.

03:48.037 --> 03:50.456
1L 43, clear from code 7.

03:50.665 --> 03:54.294
Roger, 1L 43.
Hope you had a nice lunch.

04:47.805 --> 04:50.475
Getting ready to break my old score.

04:59.317 --> 05:01.277
Gonna break my old record!

05:06.699 --> 05:09.035
Now I get my grades in kills.

05:13.039 --> 05:15.750
Just broke it!
I got the top 10 spots now!

05:15.959 --> 05:21.422
- Anybody want to take on the Ice Trey?
- Way to lay down the law, Top Cop.

06:05.842 --> 06:08.303
- How you doing?
- What's up?

06:09.512 --> 06:15.560
- Mitchie Mitch! How's it going, man?
- This is a friend of mine. Rich guy.

06:15.768 --> 06:19.522
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

06:26.487 --> 06:32.493
Requesting assistance, possible 211 at
the TV repair shop on 1st and Santee.

06:33.328 --> 06:35.538
Maxis Network Channel 3 chopper.

06:35.747 --> 06:41.252
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Something going down at 1st and Santee.

06:43.046 --> 06:46.007
This is Maxis Mobile One.
We're on our way.

06:46.466 --> 06:49.177
A quick left, quick right.

06:50.553 --> 06:52.221
All day.

06:53.306 --> 06:57.560
- We got a couple of big spenders.
- Don't get up for us.

07:09.072 --> 07:11.491
You all want to do something?

07:11.699 --> 07:16.245
Yeah, we were wondering
if maybe you'd throw in a free set.

07:16.454 --> 07:19.415
Two free sets.
One for him, one for me.

07:25.755 --> 07:27.256
What's in the bag?

07:28.257 --> 07:30.093
- Let's do it.
- All right.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.576
It's all here.

07:55.785 --> 07:57.412
- All good?
- Good to go.

07:57.787 --> 08:00.331
Good. So you show us yours.

08:03.543 --> 08:05.378
Don't look, now.

08:09.132 --> 08:10.133
Touchdown.

08:16.764 --> 08:20.935
- Check the metal detector's batteries.
- How about that, Re?

08:43.291 --> 08:44.459
Thirsty?

08:45.668 --> 08:47.003
A lifesaver.

08:48.504 --> 08:51.716
That's some pretty high-quality shit.

08:51.924 --> 08:54.761
All right. So we're on, right?

09:01.100 --> 09:03.144
What the hell is this?

09:03.561 --> 09:06.856
- What the hell is going on?
- Wait. Hold on.

09:07.065 --> 09:09.734
- This some police shit?
- What?

09:09.943 --> 09:15.073
- You brought the police back here?
- Take it easy!

09:15.281 --> 09:19.118
- Don't tell me to take it easy!
- Don't tell me to shut up.

09:19.327 --> 09:22.330
You better calm your punk ass down!

09:22.538 --> 09:24.791
Stop pointing that shit at me!

09:26.334 --> 09:29.087
- Put that away.
- You think it's a game?

09:31.172 --> 09:32.715
Put the gun away.

09:33.299 --> 09:36.719
See, it's gone.
It's all over. Let's go. Come on.

09:42.058 --> 09:45.228
Let's wrap it up.
I don't want them coming back.

09:45.436 --> 09:46.688
All right.

09:49.732 --> 09:51.567
What the hell is going on?

09:53.236 --> 09:57.573
- Shit, we on Channel 5!
- I'm gonna blast these fools!

10:25.268 --> 10:28.896
- What was that, a bazooka?
- You shot the wrong brother.

10:29.105 --> 10:33.443
- I'll find the guy with the cannon.
- Hands behind your back.

10:34.110 --> 10:38.448
I'm calling Johnnie Cochran.
I got his number. You're going down.

10:39.991 --> 10:41.326
Okay, showtime.

10:44.662 --> 10:45.913
Stop, police!

10:58.509 --> 11:01.262
Okay, round two, baby.

11:02.305 --> 11:04.933
- Freeze! L.A.P.D.!
- Undercover narcotics!

11:05.141 --> 11:08.645
- Drop it!
- We got an officer-involved shooting!

11:08.853 --> 11:14.442
Put your weapon down, right now!
Right now! Down!

11:17.695 --> 11:19.489
Good job, officer!

11:28.122 --> 11:33.544
- Smile for the camera, Ice Trey.
- Get back here! You're under arrest!

11:36.547 --> 11:40.635
Turn that shit off!
Turn that shit off!

11:49.978 --> 11:52.188
Out of my way! Police officer!

11:59.529 --> 12:00.571
Look out!

12:07.704 --> 12:09.539
Get that camera out of here!

12:17.297 --> 12:19.507
- Are you okay?
- It went through my vest.

12:19.716 --> 12:22.677
- We need an R.A. unit. Get away!
- I'm staying.

12:22.885 --> 12:27.181
- Get the goddamn camera out of here.
- I'm just doing my job.

12:28.224 --> 12:29.809
What are you doing?

12:31.227 --> 12:32.854
Get a real job.

12:35.898 --> 12:39.611
Talk to us.
Give us some information, something.

12:42.697 --> 12:45.950
- Have a statement?
- Don't break the police tape.

12:46.242 --> 12:49.454
- We have a right--
- To keep on the other side.

12:49.662 --> 12:53.333
Aren't you the cop who got busted
with his own cuffs?

12:53.541 --> 12:56.127
Think an officer doing his job
is funny?

12:56.336 --> 13:00.590
Let's see how funny it is
when I move this tape back 20 feet.

13:00.798 --> 13:03.676
- He'll be a Bloopers classic.
- Get B-roll.

13:03.885 --> 13:08.890
Come over the tape, you'll get B-roll
of me kicking your ass down to Sunset.

13:09.223 --> 13:12.143
- Detective Preston!
- Detective Preston!

13:13.937 --> 13:19.067
- Why did you shoot the camera?
- Are you a loose cannon?

13:22.111 --> 13:23.321
What happened?.

13:29.327 --> 13:31.579
- Give me all you got.
- Brad?

13:31.788 --> 13:33.206
Hi, Chase. Go.

13:33.414 --> 13:37.418
I have the show to pull your
network from the ratings toilet.

13:37.627 --> 13:40.964
- You can do public executions?
- Meet Mitch Preston.

13:42.548 --> 13:46.094
- You know I don't read.
- Look at the pictures. Annie.

13:46.302 --> 13:49.138
Get that f***ing thing out of here!

13:49.347 --> 13:50.515
What was that?

13:50.848 --> 13:53.935
"Detective Preston
destroys Maxis TV camera."

13:54.143 --> 13:57.146
- That's ours.
- "Rogue cop guns down camera."

13:57.355 --> 13:58.815
- We can sue.
- Exactly.

13:59.148 --> 14:03.361
He's Dirty Harry, he's real
and we've got him by the balls.

14:03.569 --> 14:07.323
I see where you're going with this.
A reality show.

14:07.699 --> 14:10.660
- How is it different than Cops?
- Did you see?

14:10.827 --> 14:12.745
He's a modern-day cowboy.

14:12.954 --> 14:17.166
He's sexy, volatile. He's a bad boy,
and women love bad boys.

14:17.375 --> 14:20.378
- He could frisk me.
- You like getting frisked?

14:20.795 --> 14:24.257
Brad, focus. Want to see it again
in slow motion?

14:24.465 --> 14:26.759
- I get the point. Shit!
- What?

14:26.968 --> 14:31.306
- I was outbid for an A-Team lunch box.
- Okay, Brad.

14:31.556 --> 14:36.769
- So we've got this Mitch Preston?
- We're with him 24 hours a day.

14:36.978 --> 14:41.858
Because he's gonna blow again,
and when he does, we'll be there.

14:42.191 --> 14:44.986
If he makes a lot of arrests,
he gets a prize?

14:45.194 --> 14:47.614
- Who gets the prize?
- This isn't a game show.

14:47.780 --> 14:52.785
This is one man, on his own,
kicking ass and taking names.

14:55.079 --> 14:58.166
- Can we give him a partner?
- That's a good idea.

14:58.625 --> 15:03.671
- We'll give him a funny-minority type.
- That'll get the NAACP off my back.

15:03.880 --> 15:07.008
- Or is it the NCAA?
- Do we have a deal?

15:07.216 --> 15:09.552
- Fine, go make a pilot.
- No, Brad.

15:09.761 --> 15:12.847
This guy isn't a pilot, he's a series.

15:13.056 --> 15:16.351
Trust me.
I'll stake my entire reputation on it.

15:16.893 --> 15:22.398
What reputation? You still get shit
for faking the flammable pajama story.

15:22.607 --> 15:25.401
You can't tell me that wasn't good TV.

15:25.568 --> 15:30.239
Are you in or out? I'm pitching
this at Fox in half an hour.

15:30.573 --> 15:34.035
- I'll give a six-episode commitment.
- Yes!

15:34.243 --> 15:39.415
But if it's all pit stops at Krispy
Kreme, I'm pulling the plug...

15:39.624 --> 15:43.252
- ...and you're out of a job.
- We'll all be out of a job.

15:43.461 --> 15:47.256
What do they teach you in China?
Let's go. Bring it on.

15:48.257 --> 15:50.426
- You rocked!
- We're screwed.

15:50.635 --> 15:54.889
- We know nothing about these shows.
- There are rules.

15:55.098 --> 15:58.935
Call L.A.P.D. and get clearances.
And find a cameraman.

15:59.102 --> 16:02.480
- Is Julio out of traction?
- I'll call the hospital.

16:02.689 --> 16:08.111
- What if our Dirty Harry says no?
- Everybody wants to be on TV.

16:14.993 --> 16:19.956
10-36. It looks like the stolen cuffs
were an inside job.

16:20.123 --> 16:22.583
That's very funny, guys.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.962
Very funny. Very well-written.

16:32.552 --> 16:35.763
What are you reading,
the Jenny Craig newsletter?

16:35.972 --> 16:39.934
FYI, my friend,
a lot of this is muscle.

16:40.184 --> 16:43.980
It's a flyer for some new
reality-TV cop show.

16:49.485 --> 16:54.616
- I got to be part of this.
- Thought you wanted to be a detective.

16:54.824 --> 16:57.702
I'm a cop
and I'm a professional actor.

16:57.910 --> 17:02.957
Your career consists of a few lines
on an episode of Diagnosis Murder.

17:03.416 --> 17:07.462
All I need is the right part
and I'll get my big break.

17:07.670 --> 17:11.674
Know how old Sam Jackson was
when he got his break? He was 42.

17:11.883 --> 17:16.471
Okay, but he's got, gosh,
what's that thing called? Talent.

17:16.679 --> 17:20.849
I'm talented. I ain't no Sam Jackson,
but I'm talented.

17:21.059 --> 17:25.521
Your partner will be Mitch Preston.
We know who'd wear the cuffs there.

17:25.813 --> 17:27.648
He nailed the other lead?

17:27.857 --> 17:31.486
He's front-page news.
Everybody's talking about him.

17:31.694 --> 17:35.031
I'd blow his old ass off the screen
every night.

17:35.239 --> 17:37.492
You crazy? Mitch Preston, please!

17:37.700 --> 17:41.162
I said, "Do you wanna take your feet
off the desk?"

17:42.705 --> 17:45.667
Get your feet off the desk.
Where's Lazy Boy?

17:45.875 --> 17:49.587
My client's taking the Fifth.
He's the victim here.

17:50.630 --> 17:55.134
Got yourself a pricey lawyer.
Had to sell a lot of TVs for that.

17:55.343 --> 17:58.763
- Who's paying?
- That's privileged information.

17:58.972 --> 18:02.058
The captain needs to see you
when you're done.

18:02.267 --> 18:06.312
He's done. Come on, ReRun.
This interview is over.

18:06.521 --> 18:10.525
- We don't talk, we walk.
- For now.

18:12.694 --> 18:17.407
- Do you want me to start filming?
- Yeah, everything you see. Perfect.

18:18.866 --> 18:20.201
Oh, my God.

18:20.618 --> 18:24.038
This place is so depressing.
It looks like a tomb.

18:24.247 --> 18:26.207
Well, you wanted reality.

18:26.416 --> 18:29.627
We need a reality change.
This is hideous.

18:30.503 --> 18:35.383
I'm not doing it.
Let them follow somebody else.

18:35.591 --> 18:39.387
They don't want anyone else.
You the man of the hour.

18:39.596 --> 18:44.017
- All I did was shoot a video camera.
- You made us look like savages.

18:44.225 --> 18:47.312
- The network is suing for $10 million.
- What?

18:47.520 --> 18:51.274
They said you could have killed
their cameraman.

18:51.441 --> 18:53.651
Maybe I should have killed him.

18:54.360 --> 18:59.616
The chief already cut the deal.
Do the show, and they drop the suit.

18:59.907 --> 19:02.910
What?
That's extortion! They can't do that.

19:03.119 --> 19:07.498
We need good PR.
Community relations are in the toilet.

19:07.707 --> 19:12.462
- You the best detective we got.
- So, what about this big gun?

19:12.629 --> 19:17.592
Am I supposed to let them follow me
around while I track down the weapon?

19:17.884 --> 19:22.305
- Look, I did an episode of Cops once.
- You did an episode of Cops?

19:22.472 --> 19:25.475
You forget the camera is even there.

19:25.683 --> 19:30.772
- This is real work. I'm not an actor.
- No one is saying you can't work.

19:31.356 --> 19:36.611
But you screwed up. And now
you've got to play ball. End of story.

19:38.029 --> 19:42.700
You'll be reporting
to the show's producer, Chase Renzi.

19:42.909 --> 19:45.828
Chase Renzi? Is that a real name?

19:46.204 --> 19:50.083
I won't take orders from some
coked-out Hollywood dickhead.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.961
Not in a million years.
That I won't do.

19:53.211 --> 19:56.631
That's good,
because she doesn't have a dick.

19:57.882 --> 20:02.178
Check her out for yourself.
She's outside, waiting for you.

20:06.891 --> 20:09.352
Well. Better looking than I thought.

20:11.187 --> 20:16.818
We gotta bring in color, some light.
Do you think these windows move?

20:17.986 --> 20:19.862
Detective Preston, hi.

20:20.029 --> 20:23.116
I can see you're busy.
We'll talk tomorrow.

20:23.324 --> 20:25.118
He's not very friendly.

20:25.326 --> 20:28.663
Find out where he eats.
Make a reservation for two.

20:40.174 --> 20:43.136
- Here you go, cover boy.
- Thanks.

20:44.345 --> 20:48.433
Detective Preston, Chase Renzi.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

20:48.641 --> 20:52.270
- How you doing?
- Good. I see you've already ordered.

20:52.937 --> 20:56.441
- Make it quick, I have work to do.
- What can I get you?

20:56.733 --> 21:00.695
Same as him. A cheeseburger, rare,
fries and a Coke.

21:00.987 --> 21:02.905
- Diet?
- Regular.

21:05.617 --> 21:08.703
So, Detective Preston...
Can I call you Mitch?

21:10.371 --> 21:13.958
Why don't I just launch
into a few basic questions...

21:14.167 --> 21:18.755
- ...and find out what makes you tick.
- I don't tick.

21:19.422 --> 21:22.592
- Sure you do. Everybody ticks.
- Not me.

21:23.885 --> 21:27.388
Tell me about yourself.
You have a girlfriend, a wife?

21:27.597 --> 21:29.974
- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife.

21:30.183 --> 21:32.435
Was it a painful divorce?

21:33.019 --> 21:37.440
I only ask because I was divorced,
and I know it can be difficult.

21:37.607 --> 21:39.317
I mean, did you drink?

21:39.525 --> 21:44.197
Lady, I'm here because my captain
made me. I had no choice.

21:44.405 --> 21:47.992
I have no interest in you,
your questions or your show.

21:48.284 --> 21:52.497
Not only do I understand
your resistance, I appreciate it.

21:52.914 --> 21:54.624
You do, huh? Good.

21:54.791 --> 22:00.213
I'm not into making the same bullshit
cop show we've seen a million times.

22:00.421 --> 22:05.051
That's why I believe if we're honest
and open with each other...

22:05.260 --> 22:08.179
...we could do something
very special here.

22:09.097 --> 22:11.724
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:11.933 --> 22:15.520
- I'm talking about reality, Mitch.
- There you go.

22:15.853 --> 22:18.940
Letting the world find out
who you really are.

22:19.399 --> 22:23.736
You're looking for loose cannon,
cop-on-the-edge Serpico bullshit.

22:23.945 --> 22:26.864
I'm telling you,
you're wasting your time.

22:28.574 --> 22:30.660
See that anger, Mitch?

22:31.035 --> 22:33.162
It's working for you.

22:33.371 --> 22:36.708
The audience will connect
with that in a major way.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.835
I'm out of here.

22:39.210 --> 22:42.672
I'll call you later
to discuss your new partner.

22:44.382 --> 22:46.801
Want that in a doggy bag?

22:48.261 --> 22:52.015
No.
Thanks, though. It was delicious.

22:56.269 --> 23:00.106
- How did it go? Is he intense?
- I need cherry Tums, quick.

23:00.315 --> 23:04.819
- Is he psyched about the show?
- It may be harder than I thought.

23:05.695 --> 23:08.031
- Hey!
- You son of a bitch!

23:13.494 --> 23:15.580
Freeze! L.A.P.D.!

23:24.297 --> 23:27.091
Wait! Wait!

23:43.107 --> 23:46.819
Bad idea. I only got two things
bigger than my mouth.

23:47.028 --> 23:49.530
One of them is pointed at your head.

23:51.449 --> 23:56.245
- You want to do this the hard way?
- I'll stick you, pig!

24:08.341 --> 24:12.178
- Okay, officer. You nice with yours.
- You damn right.

24:12.387 --> 24:17.558
If your boys want to know who put the
smack down on you, my badge is 38723.

24:17.809 --> 24:21.437
I go by the name of Trey Sellars,
patrolman.

24:30.905 --> 24:36.119
- I believe this belongs to you, ma'am.
- Chase Renzi. That was incredible.

24:36.577 --> 24:40.748
Just doing my job, like the badge
says, protecting and serving.

24:40.957 --> 24:44.585
- Get this psycho off me!
- What's with the Superfly shit?

24:44.794 --> 24:48.298
- I got the situation in hand.
- Top Cop, how you doing?

24:48.506 --> 24:50.049
This is my collar.

24:50.258 --> 24:53.094
Never leave a suspect
who's not cuffed.

24:53.303 --> 24:56.097
- He could've had a gun.
- Nobody got no gun.

24:56.306 --> 25:00.268
Trey, I think you broke a rib.
Tell him to get the cuffs off.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.229
I told you I can't do handcuffs.

25:03.438 --> 25:06.316
Quiet!
You have the right to remain silent!

25:06.649 --> 25:08.610
- You know each other?
- No.

25:08.818 --> 25:11.821
Never seen him before.
Just another criminal.

25:11.988 --> 25:16.200
Bullshit. We took a stage combat class
together last fall.

25:16.409 --> 25:17.702
Nice try, pal.

25:17.910 --> 25:21.497
He's just trying to weasel
his way out of the crime.

25:21.706 --> 25:25.293
- That's what he's doing.
- He looks like a real menace.

25:25.501 --> 25:26.878
Who wants to explain?

25:27.086 --> 25:31.424
Trey said he'd give me $50 if I
snatched the lady's purse and ran.

25:31.633 --> 25:34.677
He'd pull up in his police car,
jump out...

25:34.886 --> 25:38.056
...chase me up a fence,
beat me down, kick me--

25:38.264 --> 25:40.183
All right, all right. Okay.

25:41.267 --> 25:44.187
I set the whole thing up.
It was a big setup.

25:46.314 --> 25:49.442
I set it up to make it look
like I was...

25:49.651 --> 25:53.279
- I was auditioning to get this part.
- What part?

25:53.488 --> 25:56.032
Your partner.
We've been interviewing.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.117
It won't be this moron.

25:58.326 --> 26:01.162
I should report you
for impersonating a cop.

26:02.789 --> 26:06.960
Put a lock on that "moron" shit.
Why you take everything so seriously?

26:07.168 --> 26:10.129
You should be protecting,
not staging crimes.

26:10.338 --> 26:12.715
- Someone could've got hurt.
- Like me.

26:12.924 --> 26:16.219
I'm learning from a guy
who shot a news camera?

26:16.386 --> 26:20.390
You got the part already.
I'm just trying to spruce it up.

26:20.598 --> 26:24.894
- That's what you normally do at work.
- Better watch your mouth.

26:25.061 --> 26:28.606
What are you gonna do,
wrap me up in caution tape?

26:29.899 --> 26:33.319
No, I ain't gonna wrap you up
in caution tape.

26:33.528 --> 26:39.409
But I'll tell you, punk, I might whip
your ass up and down the parking lot.

26:40.118 --> 26:43.913
Work on your Starsky and Hutch
routine on your own time.

26:44.122 --> 26:47.583
You better walk off.
I was getting ready to slap you.

26:47.792 --> 26:50.336
- He's a disgrace.
- You'd work with him?

26:50.545 --> 26:52.338
Never in a million years.

26:56.092 --> 26:59.804
- I think we have good chemistry.
- Riveting.

27:00.013 --> 27:02.473
- Amazing.
- Really?

27:03.891 --> 27:05.476
Thank you. All right.

27:05.768 --> 27:09.564
The guy's a joke.
There's no way I'll work with him.

27:09.772 --> 27:12.942
I don't want to hear it.
Shit, come on.

27:15.445 --> 27:16.446
Thanks.

27:18.448 --> 27:21.826
You're doing this. That's an order.

27:23.411 --> 27:25.955
Trapped in the jaws, he struggled.

27:27.332 --> 27:31.294
You'll never see no brothers
messing with no sharks.

27:31.502 --> 27:32.503
Never.

27:38.801 --> 27:39.802
Hello?

27:42.013 --> 27:45.308
I saw you on TV,
shooting up the neighborhood.

27:48.811 --> 27:52.607
What's going on, Vargas?
I was trying to call you, dog.

27:52.815 --> 27:53.858
Oh, yeah?

27:54.067 --> 27:57.695
I got cell phones, call waiting,
e- mail, voice mail...

27:57.904 --> 28:00.823
...and I haven't heard una chingada
from you.

28:01.032 --> 28:02.742
It ain't like that, dog.

28:02.951 --> 28:06.704
I laying low till everything
dies down. It got crazy.

28:06.913 --> 28:09.332
And did I say you could use my gun?

28:09.999 --> 28:12.835
You know, Lazy Boy, I trusted you.

28:13.336 --> 28:15.254
And you let me down.

28:15.463 --> 28:19.259
And now you put
my entire shipment at risk.

28:19.676 --> 28:22.553
You used that gun
without my permission.

28:25.265 --> 28:29.852
We don't want that getting
into the wrong hands, do we now?

28:32.230 --> 28:37.694
No, I was just borrowing it.
Just testing it out, you know?

28:39.320 --> 28:44.284
- And how did it work?
- Real good. I got it right here.

28:49.163 --> 28:50.707
So we cool, right?

28:54.252 --> 28:56.713
- Yeah. We cool.
- I'm sorry about--

28:56.921 --> 29:01.509
Don't worry. We cool, Lazy Boy. Okay?

29:01.759 --> 29:03.428
- We're cool.
- All right.

29:03.678 --> 29:07.348
You two have a nice night. Okay?

29:07.557 --> 29:09.058
All right.

29:17.942 --> 29:20.111
What the hell was that all about?

29:24.782 --> 29:25.867
What the hell?

29:30.288 --> 29:34.083
- What's that?
- Stop playing this shit, man.

29:35.960 --> 29:36.961
Get down!

30:26.052 --> 30:27.345
Freeze! L.A.P.D.

30:31.432 --> 30:32.684
What do I do?

30:32.892 --> 30:34.936
Cut, cut, cut, cut. Cut.

30:36.312 --> 30:37.814
Let's do it again.

30:38.648 --> 30:39.691
Freeze! L.A.P.D.

30:41.776 --> 30:43.152
That how he's doing it?

30:43.444 --> 30:47.615
I'm laying my shit out.
Freeze! L.A.P.D. That shit is right.

30:47.824 --> 30:48.825
Ready?

30:49.158 --> 30:51.703
Patrolling your area at Friday...

30:52.036 --> 30:54.539
Friday night at 8. Eight.

30:54.956 --> 30:57.083
Patrolling every Friday at 8.

30:57.292 --> 30:59.711
Yeah, good, and be happy.

30:59.919 --> 31:02.005
Why should I? I'm patrolling.

31:02.213 --> 31:05.550
You're happy because
you're patrolling.

31:05.758 --> 31:07.302
Keeping it safe, Mitch.

31:07.552 --> 31:09.971
Patrolling every Friday at night.

31:10.263 --> 31:12.307
Every Friday night at 8.

31:15.977 --> 31:20.148
This guy is the worst actor
I have ever seen.

31:22.317 --> 31:25.528
- Get out.
- Wait a minute, hold it, cut, cut.

31:25.737 --> 31:29.449
Mitch, you can't just
toss a cameraman aside.

31:29.657 --> 31:34.662
Give me a pad, I'll show you
how a TV cop comes through the door.

31:34.871 --> 31:37.457
The doors fly open.

31:37.665 --> 31:41.169
They fly open. You burst in.
You scan the room.

31:41.377 --> 31:45.882
You do the turn, toss yourself around.
And now! You're set and--

31:46.090 --> 31:49.093
But don't turn your head
too far from camera.

31:49.302 --> 31:54.098
That little lady is your lover. Don't
respect her, she won't respect you.

31:54.307 --> 31:57.518
- Always know where she is.
- She's in my way.

31:57.727 --> 32:00.813
What's wrong?
You're getting tips from T.J. Hooker.

32:01.022 --> 32:04.400
Which is the most underrated show
in history.

32:04.609 --> 32:08.321
- Nobody came through a door like you.
- Thank you.

32:08.529 --> 32:12.033
- This guy is no detective.
- I'm playing a detective.

32:12.241 --> 32:14.911
- I'm playing detective.
- All right, guys.

32:15.119 --> 32:17.246
- I'm playing a detective.
- Okay.

32:17.872 --> 32:20.458
Let's go do some hood-jumping.

32:21.084 --> 32:22.085
What's that?

32:22.293 --> 32:26.297
- What do you think? We jump over hoods.
- Something you'd know.

32:27.090 --> 32:28.049
Freeze!

32:29.050 --> 32:34.055
That was great, Trey.
Beautiful. That was really great.

32:34.264 --> 32:39.435
- Okay, Mitch. Come here.
- I'm not going on the hood of a car.

32:39.644 --> 32:41.688
- What do you mean?
- Forget it.

32:41.896 --> 32:46.234
I entertained viewers everywhere
in the '80s, jumping on car hoods.

32:46.442 --> 32:49.904
One of a TV cop's greatest weapons.
I'll show you.

32:51.030 --> 32:56.077
You gotta stop them, see? Halt!
And you throw your body. Halt!

32:59.455 --> 33:00.790
You okay, T.J.?

33:07.088 --> 33:08.089
Moving on.

33:08.381 --> 33:09.924
Who stole the money?

33:10.133 --> 33:11.551
Deep in thought.

33:11.759 --> 33:15.555
Now the eyebrows arch,
ever so slightly.

33:16.264 --> 33:18.474
And Hooker solves another case.

33:18.683 --> 33:22.729
Okay? All right, Trey, you try it.
Go ahead. Ready?

33:23.187 --> 33:25.773
- Get loose now. Loosen up. Ready?
- Yeah.

33:26.608 --> 33:28.651
Trey, who stole the money?

33:29.277 --> 33:34.198
Good. You nailed it, first take.
Give me five. That was good!

33:34.407 --> 33:38.119
Okay, Mitch.
Come on, show me some magic.

33:38.328 --> 33:40.830
Mitch, who stole the money?

33:43.416 --> 33:45.293
Look at that, Trey. Look.

33:45.501 --> 33:48.630
Look at the anger in his eyes.
Look at that.

33:48.838 --> 33:52.967
See that slight squint says,
"Hey, I'm Mitch. I'm the man.

33:54.010 --> 33:56.512
Don't mess with me."

33:57.096 --> 33:59.515
Okay. Let's taste some drugs.

33:59.682 --> 34:03.269
Hooker's got a bag
of white powder in his hand.

34:03.478 --> 34:06.356
Spears it open with a pocketknife.

34:07.357 --> 34:09.692
Takes his little pinkie...

34:09.900 --> 34:11.902
...in the powder.

34:12.527 --> 34:16.491
And he touches it,
gently, on his tongue.

34:18.201 --> 34:19.702
Watch the eyebrows.

34:20.203 --> 34:22.371
Hooker knows it's cocaine.

34:23.121 --> 34:24.581
What if it's cyanide?

34:28.878 --> 34:33.382
Hello? Hold on. There's a reason
real cops don't taste drugs, Bill.

34:34.092 --> 34:35.842
It's never cyanide.

34:36.052 --> 34:38.513
Show me the thing with your eyebrow.

34:38.721 --> 34:41.014
- Okay, I'm on my way.
- It's tricky.

34:41.349 --> 34:45.603
- Where are you going?
- I gotta wash this shit out of my hair.

34:45.812 --> 34:49.399
We have some action?
We have some action, finally.

35:01.286 --> 35:03.121
- Beep, beep!
- Hey, Mitch.

35:03.288 --> 35:06.457
- What'd you do to my car?
- We added micro cameras.

35:06.624 --> 35:11.129
In the wheel, the glove compartment
and a crook-cam in the back.

35:11.296 --> 35:14.007
- Pretend they're not there.
- Pretend.

35:14.173 --> 35:19.012
- See? You're catching on already.
- We'll be right behind you in the van.

35:19.220 --> 35:21.723
You'll be right behind me?

35:29.981 --> 35:31.232
What are you doing?

35:31.399 --> 35:35.320
I'm on the case. I'm your partner.
We're together.

35:36.279 --> 35:38.615
Unbelievable.

35:39.616 --> 35:41.242
What's the mean face for?

35:41.618 --> 35:43.661
Listen. Don't speak, listen.

35:43.828 --> 35:47.123
There's a few things
I need to tell you.

35:47.457 --> 35:51.753
First of all, you gotta know
that I got your back covered...

35:51.961 --> 35:54.631
...and I gotta know
you got mine covered.

35:54.797 --> 35:55.965
No doubt.

35:56.132 --> 36:01.346
When we're on the job you're
the only person I can depend on.

36:01.512 --> 36:04.724
Not friends, family,
not anybody, just you.

36:04.891 --> 36:05.892
You got that?

36:06.059 --> 36:09.103
That's important.
There's no other way.

36:09.270 --> 36:11.731
And it's gotta start right now.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.613
You know, ever since I was 8,
I wanted to be a cop.

36:18.905 --> 36:22.116
I wanted to be on the force
like Uncle Reggie.

36:22.325 --> 36:26.079
He was the first in the family
on the force. Big muscles.

36:26.287 --> 36:27.372
Uncle Reggie.

36:28.039 --> 36:31.376
He used to let me ride
in the squad car with him.

36:31.542 --> 36:34.545
Once he let me play with the siren.
From then on...

36:34.712 --> 36:37.090
...I knew I was gonna be a cop.

36:37.298 --> 36:38.841
Uncle Reggie.

36:39.759 --> 36:41.177
Yeah.

36:41.719 --> 36:43.554
My uncle--

36:46.307 --> 36:49.185
Uncle Reggie passed away
two years ago.

36:49.352 --> 36:52.188
He got caught in the line
of some fire.

36:53.231 --> 36:57.193
Didn't slow me down.
I remember how he set me on my way.

36:57.402 --> 37:01.489
He's looking down on me
from a big precinct in the sky.

37:01.698 --> 37:07.161
He's thinking, "You've done all right,
Trey. You've done right by me."

37:10.290 --> 37:13.126
What does that
got to do with anything?

37:13.334 --> 37:17.338
- You got a speech, so I get a speech.
- That wasn't a speech.

37:17.547 --> 37:20.216
That "I'm your partner."
That was a speech.

37:20.550 --> 37:24.095
You burned up 90 seconds of air.
That was a speech.

37:24.304 --> 37:28.433
When we get to the crime scene,
stay out of my way.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.394
This isn't studio shit.
This is real.

37:38.234 --> 37:41.112
- Get your camera out of here.
- Hey, watch it.

37:41.321 --> 37:43.865
Julio has to shoot. That's the show.

37:44.073 --> 37:46.534
He's done Jerry Springer.

37:46.743 --> 37:49.787
That's right. Whatever you need,
I'm there.

37:49.954 --> 37:55.168
If I get shot, stabbed, it's cool.
Whatever. I'm getting good footage.

37:55.376 --> 37:58.922
Just remember three words:
Go to Trey.

37:59.088 --> 38:00.214
- I'm Trey.
- Julio.

38:00.423 --> 38:03.593
- You worked on Springer?
- Springer, Girls Gone Wild.

38:03.801 --> 38:06.804
Get that camera out of here.
Who's in the bag?

38:07.013 --> 38:08.264
We don't know yet.

38:08.473 --> 38:11.601
Whoever shot him didn't care
for open caskets.

38:11.768 --> 38:13.770
Thinking what I'm thinking?

38:13.937 --> 38:15.772
I seriously doubt it.

38:16.564 --> 38:19.943
I'm thinking there's dirty
cops on the streets...

38:20.109 --> 38:23.613
...cleaning the streets up
on they own terms, partner.

38:23.821 --> 38:27.075
This is payback for a drug deal
gone sour.

38:27.575 --> 38:29.953
Whoever this guy worked for
got pissed.

38:30.203 --> 38:33.915
Even better. This is a bad guy
retribution scenario.

38:34.123 --> 38:37.085
Good thinking, partner.
Good thinking.

38:39.420 --> 38:42.465
I think I can identify
one of the victims.

38:45.134 --> 38:48.763
Those are 12-gauge, armor-piercing
uranium shells.

38:48.972 --> 38:50.515
- Charlie.
- Hey, Mitchell.

38:50.682 --> 38:54.435
I found explosive and incendiary
rounds scattered around.

38:54.644 --> 38:58.022
The same gun that put holes
in your TV repair shop.

38:58.189 --> 39:02.819
It appears to be hand-held, automatic,
with interchangeable magazines.

39:03.027 --> 39:05.780
Technically, this gun doesn't exist.

39:05.989 --> 39:09.826
- What do you mean?
- This gun is like the 50-foot shark.

39:09.993 --> 39:11.452
Speak English.

39:11.661 --> 39:14.622
It's out there,
but nobody's ever seen it.

39:15.164 --> 39:17.333
Any idea who made it?

39:18.376 --> 39:22.964
It's a custom job. My guess is,
it's out of Eastern Europe.

39:23.339 --> 39:26.843
- Thanks, Charlie. Keep your eyes open.
- You bet.

39:32.098 --> 39:34.309
- What are you doing?
- Take it easy.

39:34.517 --> 39:39.480
- You're not supposed to touch.
- I didn't. I turned it over.

39:39.647 --> 39:42.442
- Let me know when you touch--
- I don't have to--

39:42.650 --> 39:46.195
- What's going on?
- He's contaminating my crime scene.

39:46.404 --> 39:49.198
I'm doing a sweep of the area.

39:49.407 --> 39:54.037
You never know where a crucial
bit of evidence may be hiding.

39:54.662 --> 39:56.581
Like this, for instance.

39:56.789 --> 40:01.336
Did anybody think to pull some prints
off this water bottle?

40:01.711 --> 40:03.922
Can I get an evidence bag?

40:04.130 --> 40:07.634
Put down my water.
I'm not finished drinking it.

40:09.552 --> 40:11.387
That's an honest mistake.

40:11.554 --> 40:16.768
You got your water amongst potential
evidence so I thought it was...

40:16.976 --> 40:20.271
Hey, T.J., go solve the case
somewhere else.

40:20.605 --> 40:22.607
Don't give me orders,
I'm your partner!

40:22.815 --> 40:25.193
No, you're not,
I partner with real cops.

40:25.568 --> 40:28.738
- Get me a copy of that report.
- All right, Mitch.

40:28.905 --> 40:32.367
Well, I am your partner,
so you better accept that.

40:32.617 --> 40:34.035
I am your partner!

40:36.746 --> 40:41.793
He won't open up. You know how hard
it is to work with somebody like that?

40:42.001 --> 40:47.215
I know. Mitch has been a lot
more resistant than I'd hoped for.

40:47.423 --> 40:50.927
I think that you and Mitch
need some bonding time.

40:51.469 --> 40:53.096
You're right. We do.

40:53.304 --> 40:58.434
We need some QT time together.
Two guys hanging out, have some beers.

40:58.601 --> 41:01.646
I'll call to see
if he wants to hang out.

41:02.438 --> 41:05.692
Let's not call him.
Let's just go over.

41:06.109 --> 41:08.444
- Just show up?
- Surprise him.

41:11.114 --> 41:12.657
What are you doing?

41:12.991 --> 41:16.661
How hard is it to say,
"Hi, Trey, nice to see you"?

41:16.869 --> 41:19.122
Hi, Trey. What are you doing here?

41:19.330 --> 41:22.417
We got off on the wrong foot.
I got some food.

41:22.625 --> 41:25.628
We can eat the food and bond a bit.

41:26.170 --> 41:28.131
- Bond?
- Yeah.

41:28.298 --> 41:30.508
How'd you get my address?

41:31.384 --> 41:33.928
- Hi, Mitch.
- Oh, shit.

41:34.137 --> 41:35.847
- Yeah.
- I gave it to him.

41:36.055 --> 41:39.350
- Will you invite us in? Don't be rude.
- Do I have to?

41:39.726 --> 41:43.229
You got us out in the hall
like a Jehovah's Witness.

41:43.438 --> 41:46.190
I gotta see where my star cop lives.

41:46.357 --> 41:48.026
Come on, Mitch.

41:49.527 --> 41:52.488
- Oh, my God.
- Mitch...!

41:55.325 --> 41:56.743
Nice.

41:56.951 --> 42:01.039
Got a little smell to it.
Not a stinky smell, an odd one.

42:01.247 --> 42:02.498
What is that smell?

42:02.665 --> 42:05.293
Is this here your actual living area?

42:05.460 --> 42:11.132
This is my Batcave. A tunnel
in the garage leads to my mansion.

42:13.343 --> 42:15.178
What's the problem?

42:15.386 --> 42:20.183
Research tells us buddy cops
live in visually distinctive places.

42:20.350 --> 42:26.022
Like a trailer on the beach or
a loft downtown. That kind of thing.

42:26.189 --> 42:29.734
Your research shows that, huh?
Where does he live?

42:30.234 --> 42:33.196
I rent a guesthouse from a producer.

42:33.363 --> 42:36.240
- Kind of gives off a Magnum vibe.
- Totally.

42:36.449 --> 42:40.495
It's unique. You know what, Mitch?
We can make this work.

42:40.828 --> 42:43.206
Did a crackhead make this cup?

42:44.207 --> 42:48.336
- It's not visually exciting enough?
- No. It's just--

42:48.836 --> 42:54.008
The point is to let the audience
in on all aspects of your life.

42:54.217 --> 42:59.138
They want to spend time in a place
that speaks to your personality.

42:59.347 --> 43:02.100
This does speak to my personality.

43:02.558 --> 43:06.688
Mitch, I think you need some time
away from the job.

43:07.063 --> 43:09.774
I just found the crackhead's shop.

43:10.358 --> 43:12.026
Hey, don't go in there.

43:12.193 --> 43:15.154
This is what you smell
all over the place.

43:15.363 --> 43:18.574
Wow, a pottery studio!

43:18.825 --> 43:22.287
You're full of surprises.
How long you been doing this?

43:22.453 --> 43:26.666
- Six years, give or take.
- You really got a knack for it.

43:26.874 --> 43:29.752
This room's off-limits.
It's not for show.

43:29.961 --> 43:32.255
Okay, Mitch.

43:32.463 --> 43:35.550
We haven't done any bonding
at all yet.

43:35.925 --> 43:38.595
Bond with yourself, I got work to do.

43:50.106 --> 43:52.233
Hey!

44:46.496 --> 44:47.664
Check this out.

44:47.830 --> 44:50.792
Must be some Hollywood dickhead.

45:43.636 --> 45:47.599
- Not bad, huh?
- A cop never slides across the hood.

45:47.807 --> 45:53.021
- Why? It's not police procedure?
- Your holster scratches the paint.

45:58.234 --> 45:59.569
Nice.

46:02.405 --> 46:04.741
They can buff that shit out.

46:05.033 --> 46:08.036
- I'm trying for detective.
- You take the exam?

46:08.244 --> 46:11.247
- Twice.
- And you think you won't fail again?

46:11.414 --> 46:13.625
Now I'm working with Mitch Preston.

46:13.833 --> 46:18.713
Give me some tips, and I'll tip you
on how to look better on camera.

46:18.922 --> 46:23.676
- Tips like what?
- You wear plaids, like fishermen.

46:23.885 --> 46:27.972
That's ugly shit. Wear solids.
You look slimmer on camera.

46:28.431 --> 46:31.392
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Got any tips for me?

46:31.601 --> 46:35.146
Yeah, stay out of my way
and I won't shoot you.

46:37.315 --> 46:39.275
What the hell's going on?

46:39.484 --> 46:44.322
Welcome to America's window
on your world.

46:45.365 --> 46:46.366
What is this?

46:46.532 --> 46:50.578
- We made your workspace camera-ready.
- My work space?

46:50.787 --> 46:55.166
I think it captures the reality
of an inner-city precinct.

46:55.375 --> 46:57.752
Is this where you do the makeup?

46:57.919 --> 47:02.590
No. This is good. You have to see it.
Mitch, you have to see this.

47:03.174 --> 47:07.136
- Look at your desk. It's so beautiful.
- Is this my desk?

47:07.345 --> 47:11.808
That's your desk. And that's yours,
Mitch. We didn't change it.

47:12.058 --> 47:15.478
But this is a confessional. All right?

47:15.645 --> 47:17.772
Talk about anything you want.

47:17.981 --> 47:20.775
You can talk about the job,
each other...

47:20.942 --> 47:25.446
...your sex lives. I mean,
only if you want to. Direct to camera.

47:25.655 --> 47:29.784
- No, thanks.
- You could put a pottery wheel there.

47:30.034 --> 47:33.454
Look, Mitch, this is an integral
part of the show.

47:33.663 --> 47:37.292
You're obligated to spend
five minutes a day in here.

47:37.500 --> 47:41.796
We've provided a chair.
All you have to do is sit and share.

47:41.963 --> 47:45.008
- Share?
- Learn how to turn on your heart light.

47:45.216 --> 47:46.884
- Exactly.
- Chase!

47:47.093 --> 47:49.679
Brad loves the promo footage.

47:49.887 --> 47:54.559
- But they need a catch phrase.
- I got one. "I wish I was dead."

47:54.851 --> 47:57.353
You need a catch phrase? I got it.

47:58.771 --> 48:02.859
- When I'm about to make a bust--
- When did you ever make a bust?

48:03.693 --> 48:04.777
Don't tell me.

48:04.944 --> 48:08.948
When I'm about to make a bust,
to get in the moment...

48:09.157 --> 48:14.996
...I take three deep breaths and say to
myself, "Okay, Trey, it's showtime!"

48:15.204 --> 48:17.498
- You say that?
- That's stupid.

48:17.707 --> 48:19.792
- What's stupid about it?
- Know what?

48:19.959 --> 48:22.128
Don't say it, please.

48:22.295 --> 48:26.007
No, I have to say it, Mitch.
"Showtime." It's amazing.

48:26.215 --> 48:32.055
- That could be the name of our show!
- See? It's not stupid. It's perfect.

48:32.597 --> 48:34.682
Say it again for the camera.

48:34.891 --> 48:39.687
Do it again with the breathing.
My God, you're a natural.

48:41.272 --> 48:42.273
It's showtime!

48:57.205 --> 49:02.627
This is Harley Barley taking calls
from fans of the new series Showtime.

49:02.835 --> 49:06.798
Let's go to Pete from Idaho.
You're on the air.

49:07.006 --> 49:10.176
I wanted to say to Mitch,
I know how you feel.

49:10.343 --> 49:14.138
I mean, I got a lot of anger
inside me too.

49:14.430 --> 49:17.642
I want to take my gun
and blow everybody away!

49:17.850 --> 49:21.646
Thank you, Pete.
You sure you're not calling from Waco?

49:21.813 --> 49:24.774
Let's go to line three.
Mandy, you're on.

49:24.941 --> 49:30.780
I just love me some Showtime.
I'm your biggest fan. Trey is so fine.

49:30.989 --> 49:32.991
- I could ride that.
- What?

49:33.199 --> 49:34.867
Thank you, Mandy.

49:35.076 --> 49:38.705
I'm on Showtime. What's up?

49:45.086 --> 49:47.130
Trey! Marry me, Trey!

49:47.297 --> 49:49.591
Marry me, Trey!

49:51.801 --> 49:54.137
I'm gonna be honest, you know.

49:54.345 --> 49:58.141
It's natural, when you're in
a situation that's shitty...

49:58.474 --> 50:04.105
...to think about what it might be
like to have a different partner.

50:07.525 --> 50:10.528
Like somebody that was
closer to your age.

50:10.737 --> 50:13.656
Charismatic, with a little flair
and shit.

50:13.823 --> 50:16.534
You kicking it with him,
have some fun.

50:18.911 --> 50:23.291
Me and a Wesley Snipes type.
I know you won't get Wesley.

50:23.499 --> 50:26.377
I see Wesley Snipes types
all the time.

50:26.586 --> 50:29.672
Me and a Wesley Snipes type?

50:29.881 --> 50:31.966
Can you imagine?

50:33.051 --> 50:34.344
Wesley Snipes type?

50:40.683 --> 50:43.978
Do you feel lucky, punk?
Huh? Do you?

50:44.312 --> 50:49.484
Basically, I'm saying the whole show
is slowed down just a half a beat...

50:49.859 --> 50:54.364
- I'm too old for this shit.
- ...so Mitch can keep up.

50:54.572 --> 50:58.034
Because I'm working out.
I do free-weights.

50:58.201 --> 50:59.702
Go ahead. Make my day.

51:00.036 --> 51:02.830
I'm taking care of mine. Mitch is not.

51:04.874 --> 51:08.503
That's it. I'm taking care of mine
and Mitch is not.

51:08.711 --> 51:12.006
Trey, look at this. It's all for you.

51:33.152 --> 51:36.781
- Trey, I'm right here.
- Yo, Trey.

51:47.792 --> 51:49.419
Five minutes up yet?

51:57.927 --> 51:59.429
It's showtime!

52:22.952 --> 52:24.954
What are you looking at that for,
Magnum?

52:27.957 --> 52:32.795
- How come we're not talking to him?
- Because he's sitting in county.

52:33.004 --> 52:36.215
A jailhouse.
That could be the next episode.

52:36.466 --> 52:38.927
Forget it. I put him there.

52:39.177 --> 52:41.888
He's the one who knows
about this gun.

52:42.096 --> 52:45.308
He won't talk to me. I already tried.

52:46.517 --> 52:47.685
He'll talk to me.

52:47.977 --> 52:50.563
What makes you think
he'll talk to you?

52:50.772 --> 52:53.524
I won't go in like a bulldog like you.

52:53.691 --> 52:57.320
- I'll talk. I'll be in character.
- In character!

52:57.987 --> 53:01.199
That's great.
You mean, like undercover?

53:01.407 --> 53:06.829
A little finesse, catch him off guard,
have him think I'm someone else.

53:07.455 --> 53:10.833
Character. What kind of a character?

53:11.459 --> 53:12.794
I don't know.

53:16.297 --> 53:21.427
ReRun! How you doing, my man? I'm Trey
Sellars from the Justice Channel.

53:21.636 --> 53:25.682
- Have a seat, please. You being strong?
- Yeah.

53:25.890 --> 53:30.812
- Thanks for coming. You okay?
- I ain't heard of no Justice Channel.

53:31.020 --> 53:35.650
That's because we got started
while you was rotting away in here.

53:35.984 --> 53:40.697
The Justice Channel is devoted to
shining the light on victims like you.

53:40.863 --> 53:45.326
- He's got talent, Mitch, come on.
- We're wasting our time.

53:45.868 --> 53:48.121
Is that a new shirt?

53:48.329 --> 53:50.957
It looks good. I like you in solids.

53:51.165 --> 53:54.294
What's this shit about you
getting me out?

53:54.502 --> 53:59.841
Not me, brother, the TV show.
I'm hosting a show called Framed.

54:00.174 --> 54:03.678
Let me tell you about the show.
We spotlight you.

54:03.886 --> 54:07.974
Put a light on your situation.
Let the people see you.

54:08.182 --> 54:12.687
Hopefully, we get a grassroot
campaign started and get you out.

54:12.895 --> 54:15.982
I got three people out.
You can be number four.

54:16.149 --> 54:20.194
- Like Mandela.
- Similar. You ain't as noble.

54:20.361 --> 54:23.656
You ain't no Nelson. You're ReRun.

54:23.865 --> 54:26.409
You your own man. We want ReRun out.

54:26.576 --> 54:28.995
Mandela's shit stink too.

54:29.203 --> 54:31.331
Trey, I'll talk you through this.

54:31.539 --> 54:33.333
- Not so loud.
- Say what?

54:33.666 --> 54:35.919
I wasn't that loud.

54:36.085 --> 54:39.172
You don't have to talk too loud.

54:39.380 --> 54:41.549
Shouldn't my lawyer be here?

54:41.758 --> 54:45.887
That's the wrong thing you can do.
Let me explain something.

54:46.054 --> 54:49.515
Research has shown people
don't want to hear lawyers.

54:49.724 --> 54:52.894
They want to hear it
straight from your mouth.

54:53.061 --> 54:56.064
I got Johnnie Cochran.
No offense, bro.

54:56.230 --> 54:59.651
Cochran will get a response
I'm not trying to get.

54:59.817 --> 55:02.862
I'm trying to get people
to connect with you.

55:03.071 --> 55:06.032
If they see Johnnie Cochran
in a $1000 suit...

55:06.240 --> 55:09.410
...they ain't going to get you
out of prison.

55:09.619 --> 55:13.581
Ain't no cops here.
Just me and you. Brother to brother.

55:13.790 --> 55:15.083
I'm your brother.

55:15.250 --> 55:19.420
Take it slow. Nice and easy.
He's still on the fence.

55:20.255 --> 55:24.550
All right! You and Lazy Boy
got this gun from somebody!

55:24.759 --> 55:28.179
You work for the same person!
Who you working for?

55:28.388 --> 55:31.724
What the hell?
What kind of reporter are you?

55:31.933 --> 55:35.061
- I don't tiptoe around the truth!
- Back off.

55:35.270 --> 55:39.816
And I will not back off
until I find out the truth!

55:40.650 --> 55:45.113
Brother, look at me. They selling
your black ass down the river.

55:45.321 --> 55:46.781
You say "ass" on TV?

55:46.990 --> 55:50.076
This is cable.
I can say whatever I want to.

55:50.243 --> 55:52.412
Did they tell you plea-bargain?

55:52.620 --> 55:54.414
Take the hit, do the time?

55:54.622 --> 55:56.874
That's what was said, isn't it?

55:58.668 --> 55:59.752
Yeah.

56:01.004 --> 56:03.256
See if you can get a name.

56:03.464 --> 56:04.924
It's time, ReRun.

56:05.133 --> 56:08.636
It is time to shine the light
on who's behind this.

56:08.845 --> 56:11.347
Who's the puppet master?

56:11.639 --> 56:14.183
Whose time are you doing?

56:14.350 --> 56:17.312
While you're in here
he's smelling freedom.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.689
- And tasting it.
- What you smell?

56:19.856 --> 56:23.943
- Ass.
- Ass and feet, and tension and stress.

56:24.152 --> 56:28.656
Hey, brother, that ain't for you.
Look in that camera right now.

56:28.823 --> 56:31.826
Make a connection.
Look right into the lens.

56:31.993 --> 56:35.955
Say who it is that's supposed to be
in here instead of you.

56:36.164 --> 56:39.292
Look in the camera and say it.
I'm with you.

56:39.792 --> 56:41.753
I'm right here with you.

56:43.004 --> 56:46.257
All the people out there in TV land...

56:46.424 --> 56:49.010
...and Mama, I'm coming home soon...

56:49.218 --> 56:53.222
- Your baby be home soon, Mama.
- Yes.

56:53.389 --> 56:54.641
The culprit...

56:54.849 --> 56:56.476
You'll see Mama soon.

56:56.684 --> 57:01.064
...that put me on the streets
to do his dirty work...

57:01.230 --> 57:03.816
...that's shitting on my freedom...

57:03.942 --> 57:05.360
Tell them.

57:05.526 --> 57:07.695
...is none other...

57:08.154 --> 57:10.448
This is an emotional moment.

57:10.657 --> 57:15.370
I get caught up when I know a brother
is ready to leave. I love it.

57:20.250 --> 57:22.210
...than Vargas!

57:23.711 --> 57:25.213
Caesar Vargas!

57:25.880 --> 57:26.923
He said it!

57:28.174 --> 57:30.385
Hope you're watching, bitch.

57:30.551 --> 57:33.221
- Shit.
- You did the right thing, brother.

57:33.388 --> 57:34.889
Find out where he is.

57:35.056 --> 57:36.891
You going down, baby.

57:37.100 --> 57:38.893
You made a connection.

57:39.060 --> 57:43.231
When the people see this,
they'll get rallied up. I can tell.

57:43.439 --> 57:46.818
Now, where would a guy
like Vargas kick it?

57:47.944 --> 57:50.947
- You trying to get a brother killed--
- Not at all.

57:51.155 --> 57:54.534
I do this for the viewers.
We don't point fingers.

57:54.742 --> 57:59.789
We'll say, "If you don't want to run
into Vargas don't go to this place."

57:59.998 --> 58:06.254
Hanging out with him, you wind up
in this place. That's how you got here.

58:06.421 --> 58:08.590
Look to the camera.

58:08.798 --> 58:13.553
Think about the babies, the children.
Save the babies, brother.

58:14.387 --> 58:16.055
People...

58:16.264 --> 58:20.768
...and children in TV land and all
the little kids around the world...

58:20.935 --> 58:22.895
...don't be like me.

58:23.104 --> 58:26.399
And if you want to stay
out of harm's way...

58:29.444 --> 58:33.114
...don't go to Club Cuba Loca
on Figueroa.

58:33.323 --> 58:35.825
It's a bad place. Don't go.

58:37.160 --> 58:38.286
He's just lucky.

58:38.494 --> 58:42.498
Brother, you did the right thing.
Don't you feel good?

58:43.207 --> 58:46.002
- We connected.
- A weight off my shoulders.

58:46.169 --> 58:49.130
You going down, bitch.
I got backup now.

58:49.631 --> 58:51.507
Hey, that's a wrap.

58:52.175 --> 58:54.427
Yeah! Come on, Mitch.

58:54.636 --> 58:58.014
Now it's time for us
to get down to my story.

58:58.181 --> 59:02.185
I was born in a corn field,
Grandma was a stripper--

59:02.393 --> 59:06.314
Save all that for when you do
The Oprah Winfrey Show.

59:06.522 --> 59:08.775
Yo, we going to the club tonight.

59:28.836 --> 59:30.546
Now what?

59:33.883 --> 59:35.718
Watch me.

59:40.223 --> 59:43.810
Is the mike on?
Can you turn the mike up?

59:49.649 --> 59:53.653
Sorry to bother everybody.
Is Mr. Vargas here?

59:55.697 --> 59:58.908
Anybody know where Mr. Vargas is?
Mr. Vargas?

59:59.075 --> 01:00:01.536
There he is.
See how easy that was?

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:04.038
Don't get up, we'll come to you.

01:00:04.414 --> 01:00:06.207
Sorry. Go on back...

01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:09.002
...to living la vida loca.

01:00:09.877 --> 01:00:14.340
Sorry, I always wanted to do that.
Be right with you, Mr. Vargas.

01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:21.055
Interesting approach.

01:00:21.222 --> 01:00:24.475
Just doing my part.
He's over this way.

01:00:35.778 --> 01:00:39.282
- That button-cam was a good idea.
- Yeah, I told you.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.543
- Mr. Vargas?
- Yes.

01:00:50.752 --> 01:00:55.590
I'm Detective Preston, L.A.P.D.
I'd like to ask you some questions.

01:00:55.798 --> 01:00:58.343
I am in the middle of dinner.

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:03.640
- Hope this doesn't ruin your appetite.
- I got a strong stomach.

01:01:04.933 --> 01:01:09.187
- Who's he?
- One of your employees. You know that.

01:01:09.646 --> 01:01:13.399
A lot of people work for me.
I don't know this guy.

01:01:14.025 --> 01:01:16.319
And what about this guy?

01:01:19.405 --> 01:01:21.366
What's his name?

01:01:26.496 --> 01:01:28.122
He's big...

01:01:28.623 --> 01:01:33.253
...probably big enough to go through
those bulletproof vests you wear.

01:01:35.129 --> 01:01:36.297
Am I right?

01:01:39.092 --> 01:01:41.886
Bulletproof vest, huh?

01:01:42.262 --> 01:01:43.429
And you are...?

01:01:43.763 --> 01:01:48.059
You can't miss me. I'm across
the street on the billboard.

01:01:49.811 --> 01:01:51.479
You are the TV cops.

01:01:52.021 --> 01:01:54.107
Right.

01:01:54.357 --> 01:01:56.192
What's your line again?

01:01:56.401 --> 01:01:57.860
"It's showtime!"

01:01:58.528 --> 01:02:00.989
It's showtime!

01:02:02.282 --> 01:02:03.992
I told you it was good.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.703
See how funny this is
once we arrest you.

01:02:07.078 --> 01:02:08.288
And then what?

01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:11.791
What'll you do?
Try me in The People's Court?

01:02:11.958 --> 01:02:15.878
We're gonna be watching
your punk ass 24-7, slick.

01:02:18.172 --> 01:02:20.675
Are you going to arrest me?

01:02:21.467 --> 01:02:26.222
Because if you're not, get out.
Or I have to call the real cops.

01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:29.475
- Hey, we are the real cops.
- Sure you are.

01:02:29.642 --> 01:02:33.396
- You don't think we're real cops?
- I think you're a joke.

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:37.900
It's all right. He cannot touch me.

01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:43.531
Not this time, but next time
I'll drag you out of here in cuffs.

01:02:44.908 --> 01:02:46.868
You see, I told you.

01:02:47.076 --> 01:02:49.370
They are a joke.

01:02:49.871 --> 01:02:50.830
Right?

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:04.218
- It's a joke. It's a Showtime joke.
- Showtime.

01:03:13.937 --> 01:03:15.563
That's great TV!

01:03:25.615 --> 01:03:30.119
We can take this car and meet girls
who wouldn't normally look at us.

01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:32.038
Yeah, I'll pass.

01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:35.083
You gotta go whip up
some dinner plates?

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:40.046
- Why don't you stop the car?
- All right, I'll leave you alone.

01:03:47.095 --> 01:03:51.266
- What's this, your picture and résumé?
- Those are my 8-by-10s.

01:03:51.557 --> 01:03:52.934
I just want to look.

01:03:53.476 --> 01:03:56.729
All these special skills
must come in handy, huh?

01:03:56.896 --> 01:03:58.231
I've never...

01:03:58.439 --> 01:04:00.441
...never met a...

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:03.194
...mime. Is that it? Mime?

01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:05.321
Yeah, I'm a mime. I mime.

01:04:05.947 --> 01:04:09.576
I'm curious about these movies:
Beach Party Bonzo?

01:04:09.784 --> 01:04:14.956
Yes, it's a semi-independent film.
Very low-budget, semi-independent.

01:04:15.164 --> 01:04:18.626
Planet Gorthon, 31 A.D.?

01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:23.423
Kind of light porn,
but I don't even want to go into it.

01:04:23.923 --> 01:04:27.093
You try out for the Village People?

01:04:27.885 --> 01:04:31.973
- I'm adding pottery to that list.
- Don't knock pottery.

01:04:32.348 --> 01:04:36.978
Of all the things a man can do,
why would somebody throw a pot?

01:04:37.729 --> 01:04:41.441
- lf I tell you, will you drop it?
- Please tell me.

01:04:41.649 --> 01:04:46.779
My marriage counselor. My ex and I were
on the rocks. She said get a hobby.

01:04:46.988 --> 01:04:48.948
- And that's it?
- That's it.

01:04:49.324 --> 01:04:51.618
Why are you so crappy at it?

01:04:51.826 --> 01:04:55.288
It's like you and work.
I never took it seriously.

01:04:55.872 --> 01:04:58.708
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:01.461
Why'd you become a cop, anyway?

01:05:01.794 --> 01:05:06.549
- Because I was a shitty waiter.
- You mean you were a better mime?

01:05:06.716 --> 01:05:12.263
I was an excellent mime. Still am.
Would you like to see my skills?

01:05:12.639 --> 01:05:14.515
I got the car. Don't worry.

01:05:15.516 --> 01:05:18.811
See? Now my face
is against the glass.

01:05:20.563 --> 01:05:22.607
You can mime words too. Watch.

01:05:22.815 --> 01:05:25.485
- Fuck you.
- Okay.

01:05:25.902 --> 01:05:28.071
I'm impressed.

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:31.366
There's a glass wall here.

01:05:39.332 --> 01:05:40.667
Thanks for the ride.

01:05:40.875 --> 01:05:45.588
- We got to bond, don't you think?
- No. Not really.

01:05:46.381 --> 01:05:47.674
Uh-oh.

01:05:48.258 --> 01:05:51.219
- What?
- I never leave my lights on.

01:05:58.768 --> 01:06:00.228
Surprise!

01:06:00.395 --> 01:06:01.771
What did you do?

01:06:01.938 --> 01:06:04.399
- You don't like it?
- No, I don't.

01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:08.569
Tell Don Johnson
we found his apartment.

01:06:08.778 --> 01:06:12.782
I don't know what you were thinking.
I want it back. Now!

01:06:12.991 --> 01:06:15.201
Okay, Mitch. Just relax, okay?

01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:19.372
We didn't touch the pottery.
We're giving you sex appeal.

01:06:19.539 --> 01:06:22.458
It looks like a gay porno star
lives here.

01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:24.752
And here they are, right here.

01:06:25.003 --> 01:06:26.212
Just stop.

01:06:26.421 --> 01:06:29.882
You can't change the place
without my permission.

01:06:30.091 --> 01:06:33.386
You don't have the right.
Get this dog out.

01:06:34.137 --> 01:06:35.680
Powder's yours.

01:06:35.888 --> 01:06:38.725
Mine? I don't want some dog.
What is this?

01:06:38.933 --> 01:06:41.978
He used to be a drug sniffer
in the K-9 unit.

01:06:42.186 --> 01:06:43.813
He looks like an addict.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:48.943
- He makes you look sympathetic.
- A kennel won't make him sympathetic.

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:52.113
Want me to be sympathetic?
Put my stuff back.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.491
I'll be sympathetic.
Until then, I won't be.

01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:59.746
How can you say no to that face,
Mitch?

01:07:01.247 --> 01:07:04.208
I can say no very easily.
No, Powder. Get out.

01:07:04.417 --> 01:07:06.044
Don't be like that.

01:07:06.252 --> 01:07:07.587
It's just a dog, man.

01:07:07.795 --> 01:07:10.423
Come here, Powder.
You're a good boy.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.968
Shit!

01:07:14.177 --> 01:07:16.930
Maybe Mitch is right.
Get rid of the dog.

01:07:17.138 --> 01:07:19.432
I don't know.
I like his instincts.

01:07:19.933 --> 01:07:21.643
Watch your ass, Powder.

01:07:43.957 --> 01:07:45.625
Okay. Move it.

01:07:55.093 --> 01:07:57.637
Dispatch, this is Armor 323--

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:07.689
Go! Go!

01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:28.209
Go.

01:08:55.903 --> 01:08:58.781
This is Showtime One.
We're on it.

01:09:13.087 --> 01:09:14.380
Okay.

01:09:14.589 --> 01:09:17.591
Annie, get the dish up.
Julio, go!

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.978
That's definitely our gun.

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:32.439
Watch it!

01:10:12.146 --> 01:10:13.273
Hey! Hey!

01:10:16.442 --> 01:10:19.195
- Let's go!
- Move it!

01:11:33.895 --> 01:11:35.605
Damn! We lost picture!

01:11:45.406 --> 01:11:46.908
Slow down!

01:12:24.821 --> 01:12:26.072
There he is!

01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:27.490
I got him!

01:12:35.248 --> 01:12:37.333
- Incoming!
- Watch it!

01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:50.680
- You getting this?
- Yeah!

01:12:54.809 --> 01:12:56.269
Jump!

01:12:56.477 --> 01:12:57.770
Jump! Jump!

01:12:58.646 --> 01:13:00.815
You gotta jump! Now!

01:13:01.024 --> 01:13:02.692
- Come on, Mitch!
- Do it!

01:13:21.878 --> 01:13:24.464
Now that was some good hood-jumping!

01:13:24.881 --> 01:13:26.633
You all right?

01:13:26.841 --> 01:13:28.301
You okay?

01:13:28.509 --> 01:13:30.845
I think two drops of pee came out.

01:13:36.267 --> 01:13:40.063
You're off the show, Sellars.
You're busted to patrol.

01:13:50.865 --> 01:13:52.700
Showtime is over.

01:13:52.909 --> 01:13:55.161
And we're screwed.

01:13:56.037 --> 01:13:59.082
See you back on the tape, Top Cop.

01:14:02.877 --> 01:14:06.297
Being a police officer is not
what you see on TV!

01:14:06.547 --> 01:14:09.467
I've never seen you do
anything like this!

01:14:09.676 --> 01:14:12.553
Your showboating
put this city at risk.

01:14:12.762 --> 01:14:15.098
I expect that of Trey, not you.

01:14:15.306 --> 01:14:17.517
It just escalated.

01:14:17.725 --> 01:14:22.522
Mitch, it's over. It's over.
Chief is pulling the plug on the show.

01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:27.610
- Good. Now I can get back to work.
- No, you can't. You're off the case.

01:14:27.902 --> 01:14:30.655
- What?
- PR is having a heart attack.

01:14:30.863 --> 01:14:33.700
This is worse than
when you shot the camera.

01:14:33.908 --> 01:14:37.579
If Vargas gets more guns,
we'll be even worse off.

01:14:37.787 --> 01:14:42.417
You blew it. I'm relieving you of
duty, pending an investigation.

01:14:43.001 --> 01:14:47.839
What, do you want me to turn in
my gun and my badge? Ben, come on.

01:14:48.047 --> 01:14:51.843
I just want you to go home
till this shitstorm settles.

01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:54.387
What am I supposed to do at home?

01:14:54.596 --> 01:14:57.849
I don't know. Read a book.
Watch some TV.

01:14:58.057 --> 01:15:00.685
Do your pottery projects.

01:15:05.315 --> 01:15:06.649
What?

01:15:07.942 --> 01:15:09.235
What?

01:15:10.403 --> 01:15:12.655
He's touching the pecker-cam.

01:15:14.115 --> 01:15:16.075
There's a lens in those eyes.

01:15:16.284 --> 01:15:17.285
My woodpecker?

01:15:17.493 --> 01:15:19.954
- Don't break it.
- I said no cameras.

01:15:21.581 --> 01:15:24.542
I hope you got all of this.
You hear me?

01:15:24.751 --> 01:15:26.210
I hope you got it all.

01:15:28.129 --> 01:15:30.381
He broke it.

01:15:32.467 --> 01:15:34.260
I'll get you another one.

01:15:34.469 --> 01:15:38.014
Talk to him. He's got issues.
He hates cameras.

01:15:56.866 --> 01:15:59.827
- We're here to take the dog.
- The dog stays.

01:15:59.994 --> 01:16:00.995
We have orders.

01:16:01.162 --> 01:16:05.500
He's a police officer.
Touch him and I'll shoot you.

01:16:10.838 --> 01:16:12.298
Go, go, go.

01:16:12.799 --> 01:16:15.551
Good boy, Powder. Good boy.

01:16:17.178 --> 01:16:18.972
Nobody will take you away.

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:23.226
Trey, forget Showtime.
We'll do our own buddy cop show.

01:16:23.434 --> 01:16:27.146
I got a treatment worked out
in my head. Check it.

01:16:27.355 --> 01:16:29.816
You're Nick Load, and I'm John Lock.

01:16:30.024 --> 01:16:32.318
- Nick who?
- Nick Load.

01:16:32.527 --> 01:16:36.990
You're Nick Load. I'm John Lock.
Together, we're Lock and Load.

01:16:37.198 --> 01:16:40.702
We are the baddest bicycle cops
on Venice Beach.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:43.162
Is that hot shit, or what?

01:16:43.454 --> 01:16:46.624
Listen, George Clooney
had 18 shows fail...

01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:50.086
...before he hit big with ER.
So you see?

01:16:51.254 --> 01:16:54.841
I don't wanna be the guy
putting up the caution tape.

01:16:55.049 --> 01:16:57.343
I was feeling this detective thing.

01:16:57.552 --> 01:17:01.347
Listen, you have heat
on your acting career right now.

01:17:01.556 --> 01:17:05.852
If you don't strike while the iron
is hot, it'll pass you by.

01:17:06.894 --> 01:17:11.816
Whatever. I'm gonna go see
this last episode of Showtime.

01:17:20.199 --> 01:17:22.660
You had your food. None for you.

01:17:24.037 --> 01:17:27.874
You're off the show, Sellars.
You're busted to patrol.

01:17:28.082 --> 01:17:31.252
- What happens to Mitch?
- He's relieved of duty.

01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:35.590
Mitch is my partner.
He's the only person I can depend on.

01:17:35.798 --> 01:17:38.927
Not my family, not my friends.
Just him.

01:17:39.135 --> 01:17:42.889
That's beautiful, Sellars.
What do you want me to do?

01:17:43.097 --> 01:17:48.227
- lf he's relieved, I should be.
- lf you want it, you're relieved too.

01:17:48.436 --> 01:17:49.771
Okay.

01:17:50.939 --> 01:17:53.691
- I'm relieved, then.
- Okay.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.070
- Want my gun and badge?
- Get out of here.

01:17:57.278 --> 01:17:58.821
All right.

01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:15.546
- Who is this?
- It's me, Mitch.

01:18:15.755 --> 01:18:17.340
What do you want?

01:18:17.548 --> 01:18:22.387
- Are you watching the show?
- No, I'm not. It's ancient history.

01:18:22.804 --> 01:18:26.349
- New day, new way.
- Me too. I'm eating a TV dinner.

01:18:26.557 --> 01:18:31.938
- So, what's up?
- I just, you know...

01:18:32.146 --> 01:18:34.607
I wanted to tell you that...

01:18:35.441 --> 01:18:38.653
...what you did was a pretty
standup thing and...

01:18:40.029 --> 01:18:43.825
...if you take that detective exam,
I'm there for you.

01:18:44.033 --> 01:18:46.369
Whatever questions, I'll be around.

01:18:46.578 --> 01:18:50.540
- I'd make a great detective?
- You'd make an okay detective.

01:18:51.499 --> 01:18:54.669
- Let me get that on my machine.
- I'm hanging up.

01:18:54.877 --> 01:18:56.170
No. Quick question.

01:18:56.379 --> 01:19:00.800
Could you make me a pair of those
shitty-ass mugs that you make?

01:19:01.676 --> 01:19:05.096
- You gotta be kidding.
- Relax. I'm just joking, man.

01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:07.265
No, something on the show.

01:19:07.473 --> 01:19:10.143
- So you are watching the show.
- Yeah.

01:19:10.351 --> 01:19:14.814
- Me too. What did you see?
- Charlie Hertz, works for ballistics.

01:19:15.023 --> 01:19:19.819
- That guy outside Lazy Boy's.
- Yeah, but I gotta see it again.

01:19:20.028 --> 01:19:23.323
Don't worry, I'm recording it.
I record them all.

01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:27.118
- Why am I not surprised?
- Let me rewind this thing.

01:19:31.456 --> 01:19:33.541
- It is Charlie Hertz.
- It is?

01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:37.086
- It's definitely him.
- What's he doing with Vargas?

01:20:01.945 --> 01:20:03.655
Where are the lights?

01:20:08.785 --> 01:20:11.621
We definitely found our gunmaker.

01:20:12.497 --> 01:20:14.749
This is definitely his workshop.

01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:17.293
Look at all this shit.

01:20:18.002 --> 01:20:21.965
What happened to the days
when people just grew pot?

01:20:22.173 --> 01:20:24.509
How about we star-69 his last call?

01:20:25.885 --> 01:20:28.137
King Rental Trucks,
may I help you?

01:20:28.429 --> 01:20:30.932
This is Detective Mitch Preston--

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.394
You mean the Mitch Preston?
The one on Showtime?

01:20:34.602 --> 01:20:36.854
- That's me.
- Oh, my God!

01:20:37.272 --> 01:20:41.943
Calm down, we just need some
information about a truck.

01:20:42.151 --> 01:20:46.531
- Did you rent one to a Charles Hertz?
- I'll just check, honey.

01:20:46.739 --> 01:20:49.492
Mr. Hertz picked one up this morning.

01:20:49.701 --> 01:20:53.955
- Was there a tracking device on it?
- Yes, Mitch, there was.

01:20:54.956 --> 01:20:57.375
Is Trey with you?
Can I speak to him?

01:20:57.584 --> 01:20:59.043
Sure, here.

01:20:59.294 --> 01:21:01.754
- Trey? This Trey?
- Yeah.

01:21:01.963 --> 01:21:04.257
I love you, baby!
Say, "showtime. "

01:21:04.465 --> 01:21:06.801
It's showtime!
This bitch is crazy.

01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:11.264
Okay, all right. Bye-bye.
See how popular I am?

01:21:14.559 --> 01:21:15.768
All right, thanks.

01:21:15.977 --> 01:21:18.771
We got a hit on the truck
at the Bonaventure.

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.982
- What's going on?
- Gun show.

01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:40.585
Nice guns.

01:21:40.835 --> 01:21:42.128
Come on back.

01:21:43.546 --> 01:21:44.881
It's okay.

01:22:10.573 --> 01:22:13.076
- Thanks for the call.
- Find that footage?

01:22:13.284 --> 01:22:15.662
Here are the printouts.
Good luck.

01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:17.330
You went out on a limb.

01:22:17.538 --> 01:22:21.167
I want to help. Plus I need
an ending for the finale.

01:22:29.676 --> 01:22:31.135
Excuse me.

01:22:31.886 --> 01:22:33.179
Hello, gun lovers.

01:22:33.388 --> 01:22:38.184
My name is Chase Renzi
from the hit series Showtime.

01:22:40.144 --> 01:22:42.897
That's sweet. Very sweet, very sweet.

01:22:43.106 --> 01:22:45.775
I'm here because we need your help.

01:22:45.984 --> 01:22:49.279
We believe these two men
are in the building.

01:22:49.487 --> 01:22:53.157
They are armed
and extremely dangerous.

01:22:53.658 --> 01:22:55.076
What the hell?

01:22:55.868 --> 01:22:57.412
There they are!

01:23:05.003 --> 01:23:06.212
Vargas!

01:23:22.895 --> 01:23:23.855
Don't move.

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:32.906
Oh, shit!

01:23:38.119 --> 01:23:39.329
Mitch!

01:23:50.048 --> 01:23:51.215
Guys, wait up!

01:23:51.424 --> 01:23:55.929
- Roger that.
- Ghost 3, Bonaventure Hotel.

01:23:56.971 --> 01:24:00.266
Why don't I go up and
make a nice list of demands?

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.060
I can help you here.

01:24:21.287 --> 01:24:25.959
- Get in!
- Just take it easy, all right? Easy!

01:24:33.216 --> 01:24:35.218
Vargas? There's no way out.

01:24:35.426 --> 01:24:37.053
I've got a list of demands.

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.764
Let us in and tell us what they are.

01:24:40.014 --> 01:24:43.309
All right. But first, slide your
weapons in here.

01:24:43.518 --> 01:24:46.521
- What did you say?
- I don't know. What?

01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:48.481
Slide your weapons in here.

01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:50.817
- What?
- What'd you say?

01:24:51.025 --> 01:24:53.278
You don't understand English?

01:24:53.695 --> 01:24:55.196
Slide in your weapons.

01:24:55.405 --> 01:24:58.449
Slide the weapons.
It's okay. I got a backup.

01:24:58.658 --> 01:25:01.411
Hold on. I gotta change the tape.

01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:08.167
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah, I am.

01:25:10.878 --> 01:25:13.881
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:15.133
Mitch, no.

01:25:15.383 --> 01:25:17.969
- Did you hear me?
- Hold on.

01:25:18.177 --> 01:25:20.138
Don't do that. Man!

01:25:21.389 --> 01:25:22.765
I've got demands.

01:25:22.974 --> 01:25:26.853
See those news choppers out there?
We're hooked in live.

01:25:27.061 --> 01:25:31.691
We have a cameraman out here so
you can tell the world what you want.

01:25:32.901 --> 01:25:36.362
Okay. Throw in your weapons.

01:25:36.571 --> 01:25:38.573
Here they come.

01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:50.543
Ready?

01:25:54.714 --> 01:25:56.341
There are the guns.

01:25:56.549 --> 01:25:58.217
- Stay there.
- Easy.

01:25:58.509 --> 01:26:01.012
- Stay there.
- Okay. Just take it easy.

01:26:01.262 --> 01:26:03.973
- Where's the cameraman?
- He's afraid.

01:26:04.182 --> 01:26:08.061
We don't want to put him in danger,
so he'll do the shooting.

01:26:08.269 --> 01:26:09.395
I'll do it.

01:26:09.604 --> 01:26:12.190
You ever been on TV before?

01:26:12.857 --> 01:26:16.277
It's very simple.
Look at the red light.

01:26:16.486 --> 01:26:19.405
Tell the people what's on your mind.

01:26:20.573 --> 01:26:22.533
You got him all lined up?

01:26:23.785 --> 01:26:26.079
Yeah. Let's shoot.

01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:30.250
Okay. All right.
It's showtime.

01:27:02.407 --> 01:27:03.908
You okay?

01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:13.585
Mitch?

01:27:32.687 --> 01:27:35.231
- Trey! Where are you?
- Over here!

01:27:39.235 --> 01:27:41.779
- What are you doing?
- Hold on!

01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:48.745
Oh, God!

01:28:01.716 --> 01:28:06.220
Now it's your turn to smile
for the cameras.

01:28:10.475 --> 01:28:14.729
- Get that camera out of here!
- Keep that camera where it is!

01:28:31.788 --> 01:28:35.041
Annie, you deal with it, girl.

01:28:35.959 --> 01:28:39.337
What's going on
with your new recruits?

01:28:39.545 --> 01:28:42.715
I'm tired of your voice.
You're on my last nerve.

01:28:42.924 --> 01:28:46.594
- They're not bonding.
- They don't have our chemistry.

01:28:46.803 --> 01:28:51.557
Which is why you ought
to guest star in the next episode.

01:28:51.724 --> 01:28:54.060
- Not in a million years.
- That's a yes.

01:28:54.269 --> 01:28:57.146
I know, and believe me,
I'm working on him.

01:28:59.649 --> 01:29:01.192
See you at 8, Mitch.

01:29:01.442 --> 01:29:05.738
Look at what you get. What do I get?
Nothing. I'm going to work.

01:29:07.949 --> 01:29:11.744
I made you something.
For passing the detective exam.

01:29:11.953 --> 01:29:14.247
That is nice of you to do that.

01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:20.461
Mitch, that's nice.

01:29:21.713 --> 01:29:23.423
What is that?

01:29:23.715 --> 01:29:28.928
- What is it? It's a loose change dish.
- Of course it's a loose change dish.

01:29:29.137 --> 01:29:33.057
I haven't seen this level of
craftsmanship since kindergarten.

01:29:33.308 --> 01:29:35.226
It's appreciated, partner.

01:29:35.435 --> 01:29:39.772
- Detectives, your suspect's waiting.
- Be right with you.

01:29:39.981 --> 01:29:43.276
"Detective Sellars."
It has a nice ring to it.

01:29:43.484 --> 01:29:46.070
Come on, Top Cop, it's showtime.

01:29:47.488 --> 01:29:49.866
Hi. I'm Detective Mitch Preston.

01:29:50.617 --> 01:29:51.784
No!

01:29:52.994 --> 01:29:54.829
I'm sorry, I can't...

01:29:55.997 --> 01:29:57.290
Book 'em, Danno.

01:29:57.999 --> 01:30:01.461
You're under arrest!
You under arrest, mother****er!

01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:03.296
I'm sorry.

01:30:04.339 --> 01:30:07.634
This Preston character
needs to come to life.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.969
He doesn't have any balls.

01:30:10.178 --> 01:30:11.763
Well, he has balls.

01:30:12.013 --> 01:30:14.807
They gotta come out.
Bada-bing, bada-boom balls.

01:30:15.516 --> 01:30:17.352
Do you feel lucky, punk?

01:30:18.353 --> 01:30:19.646
Who said that?

01:30:21.397 --> 01:30:24.484
I know you know, Mitch.
You're gonna see this--

01:30:25.026 --> 01:30:27.570
Get that camera out of here!

01:30:28.905 --> 01:30:30.990
Could you come a little closer?

01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:34.202
I'm sorry, I did the wrong thing.

01:30:42.043 --> 01:30:46.756
Wrap me up in caution tape,
wrap me up in caution tape, Cop Top?

01:30:47.548 --> 01:30:50.677
- You don't think we're--
- Say that in Ebonic!

01:30:50.843 --> 01:30:51.886
I'm tired.

01:30:52.095 --> 01:30:54.138
- Who are you?
- I'm Annie.

01:30:54.389 --> 01:30:57.141
You need a daddy?
Yes or no?

01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:02.021
"Oh, Bill." That's what I get now.

01:31:02.230 --> 01:31:05.316
It used to be "Oh, yeah,"
now it's "Oh, Bill."

01:31:05.525 --> 01:31:07.652
It's showtime!

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.320
It's showtime.

01:31:09.529 --> 01:31:11.990
Get that camera out of here!
