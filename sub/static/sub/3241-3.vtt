WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:03.341
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.420 --> 00:05.514
<i>We were in Scotland
on our second honeymoon.</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:09.969
<i>I wanted it to be a dream,
but I knew it wasn't.</i>

00:10.052 --> 00:12.180
<i>I was no longer in the 20th century.</i>

00:12.554 --> 00:14.352
<i>It was like landing on an alien world</i>

00:14.431 --> 00:15.978
<i>you'd only glimpsed
through a telescope.</i>

00:16.058 --> 00:17.435
Are you following me?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.612
I am but Dougal's eyes, no his head.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.484
I suspect you may be an English spy.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.780
My name is Geillis Duncan.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.904
I hope I'll see you tonight
at the hall.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.246
He's offering to take
the girl's punishment.

00:30.489 --> 00:33.038
You need not be scared of me
nor anyone else here

00:33.116 --> 00:34.663
as long as I'm with ye.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.713
You will remain here as my guest.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.415
You mean as your prisoner,
don't you?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.216
Only if you try to leave.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

02:24.353 --> 02:25.855
I contacted Colonel Halligan.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.781
He said it might be a week before
he can issue a new set of orders.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.077
Frank, I don't feel it's right
to use your connections.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.033
What of these men, they've
no one to change their orders.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.910
I don't understand
why you would want to even...

02:35.989 --> 02:38.117
What I want is
my husband at home with me.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.248
But I can't have that right now.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.130
And if people use the system
to their own benefit,

02:43.205 --> 02:45.173
then we might as well
just give up the ship

02:45.248 --> 02:46.841
and start speaking German.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.011
Please, listen to reason,
if not your husband.

02:49.628 --> 02:50.880
Darling,

02:51.755 --> 02:53.098
it will be all right.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.099
I'll be all right. I'm sure of it.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.262
You have to trust me on this.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.191
Woe betide the man
that stands between you

03:03.266 --> 03:05.234
and what you set your mind upon.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.022
And damned if that stubbornness

03:08.980 --> 03:10.778
isn't what I find
so attractive about you.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.695
All aboard!

03:18.740 --> 03:20.458
All aboard!

03:23.286 --> 03:25.414
As they say, that's my cue.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.798
This is backwards.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.180
I should be the one
leaving for the front lines.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.721
Welcome to the 20th century.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.352
Please, don't take
any unnecessary risks.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.975
- I won't.
- I love you.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.569
Claire Beauchamp Randall,

03:53.442 --> 03:55.444
promise that you'll return to me.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.822
I will, Frank Randall.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.495
I promise.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.341
Bloody hell.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.721
Aye, a bit brisk?

04:19.176 --> 04:21.224
Keeps you clearheaded
and strong though.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.066
I really can wash
and dress myself, you know.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.936
Oh, I don't mind helping you.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.357
Such beautiful skin you have.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.276
I've never seen a woman
past eight or nine

04:36.359 --> 04:39.078
with skin so unmarked
by injury or illness.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.374
Your next husband
will be a lucky man.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.128
What's wrong?

04:53.168 --> 04:54.340
Mrs. Fitz,

04:56.004 --> 04:57.722
can I tell you something?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.058
Of course you can.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.936
It's about my husband.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.480
He's not dead.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.691
Have you run away from him?

05:13.063 --> 05:14.315
Was he no a good man?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.115
No, he's wonderful.

05:16.775 --> 05:17.822
It's just, well...

05:19.861 --> 05:21.204
He hasn't been born yet.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.951
I don't understand your meaning.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.710
Mrs. Fitz, I seem to have

05:31.873 --> 05:33.090
fallen through time.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.509
I was on my honeymoon in 1945,

05:41.216 --> 05:42.513
200 years from now.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.554
It was Samhain,
and I went to the stone circle

05:45.637 --> 05:46.684
at Craigh na Dun.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.563
Do you know it?

05:51.935 --> 05:52.982
Aye.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.531
I've heard strange tales.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.738
I touched the stone, and it...

05:59.651 --> 06:02.905
The world just spun out of control,

06:04.114 --> 06:06.162
and the next thing I knew, I was here

06:06.950 --> 06:08.577
in 1743.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.297
I'm not an English spy.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.968
I'm from the future.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.344
It's a lotto take to mind.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.894
I can hardly believe it myself.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.317
I don't even know if I can
travel forward to my own time.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.911
I have to get back to the stones.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.325
Is it my help you're asking?

06:46.323 --> 06:47.870
Do you think the MacKenzies
would believe me

06:47.949 --> 06:49.201
if I told them the truth?

06:49.284 --> 06:50.627
Perhaps.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.955
You're fair of eye
and honeyed of tongue,

06:53.038 --> 06:54.756
but I see you now for what you are.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.791
What?

06:56.958 --> 06:58.756
Be gone, evil demon.

06:58.835 --> 06:59.961
I abjure thee!

07:00.045 --> 07:02.343
- No, Mrs. Fitz...
- I'm a good Christian woman!

07:02.422 --> 07:03.924
I'll not let you spell me.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.884
- Mrs. Fitz, no!
- Witch! Witch!

07:07.302 --> 07:08.519
Oh, aye.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.980
Hundreds of MacKenzies
will be turning up

07:11.056 --> 07:12.854
in the next few days
for the gathering.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.686
Are you listening to me, child?

07:17.687 --> 07:18.859
Sorry, what?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.282
Gathering?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.567
I'm not familiar with that term.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.866
'Tis where all the MacKenzie men

07:24.986 --> 07:27.114
throughout the Highlands
come and plight their oath

07:27.197 --> 07:28.574
to the clan and himself.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.119
Last one was decades ago
when Colum was made laird.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.542
I'm fair glad you're here
to handle the physicking.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.883
I have enough to manage
without dealing with folks' ailments.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.588
You do well with that.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.674
Dougal and himself
will not forget it.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.601
You'll be in their good graces,
make no mistake.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.392
<i>If I could get in
Colum and Dougal's good graces,</i>

07:54.516 --> 07:56.189
<i>perhaps I could win my release</i>

07:56.267 --> 07:58.486
<i>and begin to make my way
back to Frank.</i>

07:59.062 --> 08:00.405
"For headache,

08:01.523 --> 08:04.322
"take ye one ball of horse dung.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.618
"It is to be carefully dried."

08:05.694 --> 08:07.162
<i>Medicine and caring for the people</i>

08:07.237 --> 08:09.831
<i>of the clan MacKenzie
seemed the most logical way</i>

08:09.906 --> 08:12.034
<i>for me to earn their trust,</i>

08:12.117 --> 08:14.711
<i>but in order to do that
without raising suspicion,</i>

08:14.786 --> 08:17.756
<i>I would have to find a way to
apply 20th century medicine</i>

08:18.081 --> 08:21.335
<i>using only the methods
and equipment available in the 18th.</i>

08:21.543 --> 08:22.715
"Slaters."

08:27.257 --> 08:29.931
Woodlice! Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!

08:45.442 --> 08:48.286
<i>Alongside the jars
of pigeons' blood, ant eggs,</i>

08:48.361 --> 08:50.489
<i>and powdered human skull...</i>

08:50.613 --> 08:52.115
<i>Whose, I wondered...</i>

08:52.574 --> 08:54.451
<i>There were a number of
herbs and extractions</i>

08:54.534 --> 08:57.458
<i>in Beaton's collection
that might actually be helpful.</i>

09:12.135 --> 09:13.136
It's okay.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.517
Now, wasn't so bad, was it?

09:24.773 --> 09:27.151
<i>My guards began
to spend their time in the kitchen</i>

09:27.233 --> 09:28.701
<i>while I was seeing patients.</i>

09:29.778 --> 09:33.578
<i>I told myself this was
a good sign, a sign of trust,</i>

09:34.491 --> 09:36.835
<i>a feeling they hopefully
would share with Dougal.</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:38.586
Excuse me, gentlemen.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.038
I could use some help in the surgery.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.707
The discarded medicines
need to be disposed of.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.584
What are you
two drunkards still doing

09:44.667 --> 09:46.044
taking up space in my kitchen?

09:46.252 --> 09:48.220
If you're networking here,
be gone with ye.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.931
We're just following orders,

09:50.006 --> 09:51.007
keeping an eye on this one.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.014
Oh, and has she been
hiding at the bottom of your mug

09:53.093 --> 09:54.595
for the past two hours?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.648
Oh, Shona.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.976
Dinna fash yourself over this.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.770
Go on home now.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.479
Be with your other wee bairns.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.026
Carry on working.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.372
Who was that?

10:15.073 --> 10:16.199
Colum's chambermaid.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.080
Is she going to be all right?

10:18.409 --> 10:20.411
Aye, in time.

10:23.081 --> 10:27.006
Her boy died last night,
wee Lindsay MacNeill.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.131
What happened?

10:31.214 --> 10:32.682
Why did nobody come and get me?

10:33.258 --> 10:37.058
Oh, Miss, what ailed
wee Lindsay has no mortal cure.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.726
He went up
to An Eaglais Dhubh, he did.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.770
Where?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.436
The old ruins of the
Benedictine monastery.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.406
Folk hereabout call it
The Black Kirk.

10:49.941 --> 10:53.070
You think somehow
the ruins killed him?

10:53.194 --> 10:55.367
It was not the ruins, you daft woman.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.991
It was the demons
who roam free inside the ruins.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.584
Poor wee soul.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.582
Sickly boy on his best day.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.997
No match for Old Nick.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.012
The Mackenzie requests
your presence in his chambers,

11:11.087 --> 11:12.509
Mistress Beauchamp.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.264
Have you never heard
of a comb, you wee gomeril?

11:16.342 --> 11:17.764
Leave off, Auntie.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.846
My nephew, Tammas Baxter.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.142
Lindsay MacNeill was
like a brother to him.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.317
MacKenzie's waiting.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.608
Right.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.024
The medicines are on the step.
You can't miss them.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.590
<i>I wished I had
the ability to treat Colum.</i>

11:52.503 --> 11:55.598
<i>It would alleviate
what I knew was a great deal of pain,</i>

11:56.257 --> 11:58.100
<i>and it would certainly
make Colum see me</i>

11:58.176 --> 11:59.473
<i>in a more favorable light.</i>

12:12.232 --> 12:15.862
It'll be a trifle longer
than your standard frock coat.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.916
Well, you're hardly standard,
now, are you, my Laird?

12:21.282 --> 12:24.627
A one-of-a-kind coat
for a one-of-a-kind man.

12:26.829 --> 12:31.084
I was told that you're the finest
tailor in the Highlands,

12:31.834 --> 12:33.302
come fresh from Edinburgh.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.176
Well, I thank you, my Laird.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.640
My wife's people are Mackenzies,

12:37.840 --> 12:40.844
and I'm always happy
for a chance to bring her home.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.938
And did your wife's people
encourage you

12:44.013 --> 12:45.435
to mock your laird?

12:46.891 --> 12:47.892
Mock?

12:48.309 --> 12:52.280
Does not a man's coat
usually fall just to the knee?

12:53.064 --> 12:54.236
- Yes.
- And did I

12:54.357 --> 12:56.701
ask you for anything
different than that?

12:57.735 --> 13:01.114
Well, no, not explicitly,
but I just thought...

13:01.197 --> 13:03.199
That my legs should be hidden?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.869
That I have something
to be ashamed of?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.546
I would never presume.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.042
My Laird...

13:13.876 --> 13:14.923
Please.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.470
You make me a standard frock coat

13:24.470 --> 13:26.893
and have it back to me by tomorrow.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.233
Of course, my Laird.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.518
Thank you, my Laird.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.695
Thank you.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.168
Do you sew as well as physick,
Mistress Beauchamp?

13:48.703 --> 13:51.957
Only flesh, which makes
a rather poor garment, I'm afraid.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.921
Just as well,
I called you here on another matter.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.760
Davie Beaton...

14:04.302 --> 14:05.303
He used to massage me.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.685
It made movement easier.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.483
I hoped you would do the same.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.731
Of course.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.582
What's wrong?

14:27.367 --> 14:30.962
Do you find my legs as repellent
as the tailor does?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.255
No, it's just...

14:34.457 --> 14:35.800
Well, I believe
it'd be more beneficial

14:35.917 --> 14:38.796
if rather than your legs,
I massaged the base of your spine.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.560
Don't tell me my arse
offends you too.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.946
Moist heat is usually
quite soothing after a massage.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.370
Is there any water for
boiling or some clean cloth?

15:04.946 --> 15:05.993
No.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.829
Mrs. MacNeill, my chambermaid,

15:09.200 --> 15:10.668
she lost her son last night.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.129
She hasn't been in this morning.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.290
I was very sorry
to hear about her boy.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.666
Aye.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.755
It's Satan's work.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.836
The foolish child...

15:22.046 --> 15:23.923
He went up to The Black Kirk.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.518
Sometimes I wonder

15:30.847 --> 15:34.021
what I did to make the devil
punish me like this.

15:40.148 --> 15:43.698
What, you don't have
demons in Oxfordshire, Mistress?

15:46.028 --> 15:47.200
We do,

15:48.865 --> 15:50.208
but we call them Scots.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.342
Sorry, did I hurt you?

16:00.626 --> 16:01.843
No, no.

16:02.712 --> 16:03.759
On the contrary.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.391
You're easing the pain considerably.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.226
Gwyllyn the Bard,

16:12.472 --> 16:15.897
he'll be singing in the hall tonight
before the gathering.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.736
I'd like you to come along
as my guest.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.027
Thank you.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.977
My brother looks very well tonight.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.107
He says it's down to you
and your healing touch.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.573
I'm glad I could be of service.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.611
Aye. Seems that the feral cat
we picked up on the road

17:08.778 --> 17:10.280
is trying to pull in her claws.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.246
What a charming description.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.002
If you'll excuse me,

17:21.082 --> 17:23.631
I believe I'll have
a better view from over there.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.107
Hello.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.906
We've not been properly introduced.
I'm Claire Beauchamp.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.240
Laoghaire Mackenzie.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.496
Cuts quite the fine figure,
Mr. MacTavish.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.671
Aye.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.220
But it's not me he fancies.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.555
Well, men rarely know
what's best for them.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.019
That's what us women are for.

18:16.846 --> 18:17.847
Laoghaire.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.815
Mrs. Beauchamp.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.646
Mr. MacTavish.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.028
I was just telling Miss Mackenzie
how beautiful she looked tonight.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.281
Aye. Aye, she's bonny.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.749
I don't understand a word,

18:45.791 --> 18:47.213
but it's so beautiful.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.806
Has Gwyllyn been at the castle long?

18:55.885 --> 18:56.886
Aye.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.472
Many years.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.358
I spent a year at Leoch
when I was 16 or so.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.727
Gwyllyn was here then.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.146
Colum pays him well. Has to.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.779
The Welshman would be
welcome at any laird's hearth.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.535
I remember
when you were here before.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.280
Do you?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.616
You canna been much more
than seven or eight yourself.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.245
I doubt I was much to see then
so as to be remembered.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.414
Well, I do remember, though.

19:25.206 --> 19:29.256
You were so, I mean,
do you not remember me from then?

19:30.127 --> 19:32.255
No. No, I dinna think so.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.058
Still, I wouldna even be likely to.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.017
A young birkie of 16's too taken up

19:40.096 --> 19:41.939
with his own grand self
to pay much heed

19:42.014 --> 19:43.357
to what he thinks are naught

19:43.432 --> 19:45.855
but a rabble of snot-nosed bairns.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.341
Colum's rhenish, is it?

20:09.917 --> 20:11.214
It's very good.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.134
I've had two... Three glasses.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.424
You can have the rest if you like.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.718
Most folks who drink with Colum

20:18.801 --> 20:20.678
are under the table
after the second glass.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.222
Are you implying
that I'm intoxicated?

20:24.598 --> 20:26.396
I'd be impressed if you weren't.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.163
This dressings
been chafing me for days.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.423
- Would you mind helping me with it?
- Now?

20:49.623 --> 20:50.795
Well...

20:52.418 --> 20:53.840
Yes, of course.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.590
Take that back, will you, lass?

21:10.060 --> 21:12.358
All right, so let's have
a look at that shoulder.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.273
I dinna need your help.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.284
I just thought I should
see you back to surgery

21:17.359 --> 21:19.032
while you could still walk upright.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.207
Thank you.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.367
I suppose I did overindulge slightly.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.128
I should have known, though.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.414
If it was really uncomfortable,
I imagine

21:30.498 --> 21:32.876
you would have just ripped off
the bandages yourself.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.635
Oh, I was afraid to.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.053
Thought I'd get my arse
skelped if I touched it.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.721
Too right.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.386
I am the healer, after all.
I'm in charge.

21:40.758 --> 21:41.850
Never doubted it.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.560
Really, though,
if it was bothering you,

21:46.639 --> 21:47.982
you should have told me.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.105
I would have taken it off for you
the other day at the stables.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.778
No. I couldna do that before Alec.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.611
Scars.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.318
You don't want Alec to know
you've been flogged?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.242
No. No.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.949
Old Alec knows I've been flogged,

22:05.032 --> 22:06.750
but he's not seen it.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.000
To know something like that is...

22:10.079 --> 22:12.377
Well, it's not the same
as seeing it with your own eyes.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.550
It's a bit personal,
maybe, is what I mean.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.265
I think if Alec
were to see the scars,

22:23.259 --> 22:25.887
he couldna see me anymore
without thinking of my back.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.099
You don't mind me seeing your back?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.108
I don't.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.862
You seem to have a knack
for letting me know

22:34.937 --> 22:36.154
you feel sorry for it

22:36.230 --> 22:37.982
without making me
feel pitiful about it.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.992
Anyway...

22:49.493 --> 22:50.540
I should go.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.414
Wait.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.377
Let me have a look at that.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.536
It's scabbed over nicely.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.412
There's no drainage.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.257
Take those bandages off
in a few days.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.428
As you say.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.679
Good night, Mr. MacTavish.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.596
Good night, Mistress Beauchamp.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.957
Do you never sit down, woman?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.210
My breakfast's barely past my gullet.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.883
Walking is good for digestion.

24:22.711 --> 24:23.712
Claire.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.095
I'm so glad you could join me.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.346
Wouldn't have missed it.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.021
This just keeps getting worse.

24:33.097 --> 24:36.601
Got stuck walking with that
pompous windbag Father Bain.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.153
He plans to perform an
exorcism on the Baxter boy.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.401
Hawthorn berries.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.617
You rarely see these
so late in season.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.989
Did you just say "exorcism"?

24:47.611 --> 24:50.239
Apparently Tammas Baxter
went to The Black Kirk

24:50.364 --> 24:51.832
with wee Lindsay MacNeill.

24:52.783 --> 24:55.081
Now the young fool
is seized with the same evil.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.578
Do you want some?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.043
No.

24:59.790 --> 25:00.882
What is it?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.127
What's wrong with you?

25:03.210 --> 25:07.340
Well, the boy, Tammas,
he's Mrs. Fitz's nephew.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.765
When you say "seized with evil,"
what exactly do you mean?

25:12.553 --> 25:13.896
Is he ill?

25:14.763 --> 25:17.266
He's not ill. He's possessed.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.277
Do you not believe
in demonic possession, Claire?

25:21.437 --> 25:22.529
Do you?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.825
I believe there are
powers beyond our ken...

25:29.278 --> 25:32.077
Beyond what we can see
and hear and touch.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.961
Demon, fairy, devil, doesn't matter
what name we put on them.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.131
But you believe
in the powers of magic,

25:41.206 --> 25:42.423
do you not?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.465
Haven't really thought much about it.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.890
Have you never
found yourself in a situation

25:50.591 --> 25:52.719
with no earthly explanation?

25:55.137 --> 25:57.731
You have to admit
it's certainly possible

25:57.806 --> 26:00.650
the boy's actually sick
and not possessed.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.232
And if that's the case,
then perhaps there's something

26:03.312 --> 26:04.689
you and I can do to help.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.151
People believe the boy
is possessed, Claire.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.159
You challenge that at your peril.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.661
I'll not go near him,
and neither should you.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.256
Where are we goin?

26:23.290 --> 26:24.337
Hey!

26:36.011 --> 26:38.059
Hey, where you goin?

26:46.188 --> 26:50.193
Colum will not like you interfering
with the workings of the spirits.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.369
It's not your place.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.583
I thought that might
change your mind.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.621
A priest once told me
my healing skills

27:02.704 --> 27:03.705
were a gift from God.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.856
My sister has gone
to fetch Father Bain.

27:26.687 --> 27:28.234
Why is he tied?

27:28.397 --> 27:29.694
In case he gets violent.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.485
The demons, you ken.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.741
Tammas, Tammas, I'm here to help.

27:37.114 --> 27:38.912
Are his symptoms similar
to that of the other boy?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.914
Aye, much the same.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.705
Wee Lindsay was weak to begin with,
so the devil took him much faster.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.669
<i>No fever,</i>

27:47.624 --> 27:49.968
<i>which meant it probably
wasn't an infection.</i>

27:50.961 --> 27:52.087
Are any of the others ill?

27:52.212 --> 27:54.431
No, all right as rain.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.556
<i>His heart rate was slow
and pupils pinpoints,</i>

27:57.676 --> 27:58.893
<i>a sign of poisoning.</i>

27:59.011 --> 28:01.059
Tammas? Tammas?

28:01.805 --> 28:03.102
What have you eaten recently?

28:03.849 --> 28:06.272
He's taken nothing
but a bit of broth in the last day,

28:06.351 --> 28:08.399
and most of that
he brought back up again.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.401
Nay, don't come near me.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.736
He sees the demons even now.

28:11.982 --> 28:14.701
It's all right.
He's just hallucinating.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.323
It's another symptom.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.372
Give me something to cut these ropes.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.491
No, Miss. I wouldna do that.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.542
I should say not.

28:23.744 --> 28:24.961
What are you doing, Glenna?

28:25.204 --> 28:27.081
Letting a stranger in
at a time like this?

28:27.164 --> 28:29.462
Mistress Beauchamp
is a healer and a good one.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.218
She may be able to help.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.808
Mrs. Baxter, he needs to be
unbound and fresh air let in.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.604
I believe I can ease his suffering.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.056
Just give me a chance.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.740
Best make way now, lass.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.032
Let the father do his work.

29:38.402 --> 29:39.870
Did you feel a chill
when you got near him?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.871
- A chill?
- Well, they say

29:41.947 --> 29:44.951
you can feel Old Nick's presence
by the chill in the air.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.706
Sorry to disappoint, no.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.879
He must have been
speaking in tongues?

29:48.954 --> 29:50.206
I'm afraid not.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.259
Well, I heard tell
that wee Lindsay howled in five...

29:53.959 --> 29:55.552
Lazy, fat bastard.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.304
Wait right here.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.181
<i>I felt sure Mrs. Fitz
would let me examine the boy</i>

30:07.264 --> 30:09.813
<i>after the good father
finished his incantation.</i>

30:10.392 --> 30:13.316
<i>But even if I could figure out
what was wrong with him,</i>

30:13.395 --> 30:15.397
<i>I might not be able
to do anything about it</i>

30:15.480 --> 30:17.232
<i>with the limited resources at hand.</i>

30:30.871 --> 30:32.373
Good, very good.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.425
You ken how to obey
a man's orders for once.

30:35.876 --> 30:36.968
Move.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.180
Your lip looks
a little swollen, Jamie.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.141
Did you get thumped by a horse?

30:55.270 --> 30:56.567
Aye.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.526
Swung his head when I wasn't looking.

31:00.609 --> 31:01.861
That's too bad.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.286
Those fillies can be dangerous.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.541
Fillies?

31:08.241 --> 31:10.369
Alec has you working the fillies now?

31:14.956 --> 31:16.128
Hey!

31:17.626 --> 31:19.754
- What's wrong with you?
- Bit my tongue.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.715
Clumsy dolt.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.431
I best go see if
Alec wants anything else.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.606
Hey, if you're teasing
the lad about Laoghaire...

31:38.980 --> 31:41.199
If her father or Colum
comes to know about it,

31:41.900 --> 31:43.902
young Jamie could get
more than a bloodied nose.

31:44.861 --> 31:45.987
Like a wife?

31:46.696 --> 31:47.868
Maybe.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.037
That's not the wife he should have.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.619
- No?
- No.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.831
He needs a woman, not a lassie.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.669
And Laoghaire
will be a girl until she's 50.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.553
I've been around long enough
to ken the difference very well,

32:08.093 --> 32:10.016
and so do you, Mistress.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.284
<i>I felt ashamed of the way
I'd teased Jamie,</i>

32:33.243 --> 32:35.337
<i>and if I was being perfectly honest,</i>

32:35.412 --> 32:37.164
<i>I did it because I was jealous...</i>

32:38.165 --> 32:39.963
<i>Not jealous of Laoghaire...</i>

32:40.750 --> 32:42.502
<i>Jealous of their intimacy.</i>

32:44.129 --> 32:45.881
<i>I missed my husband.</i>

32:49.217 --> 32:50.218
<i>Mistress Beauchamp.</i>

32:52.095 --> 32:53.221
Mistress Beauchamp,

32:54.514 --> 32:55.561
are you all right?

32:55.974 --> 32:57.396
Yes, I'm fine.

32:57.559 --> 32:58.902
Thank you.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.814
What can I do for you, Mr. MacKenzie?

33:03.064 --> 33:05.158
I thought you might like
to visit Geillis Duncan,

33:05.233 --> 33:06.530
the fiscal's wife,

33:07.611 --> 33:09.739
to restock yer shelves
before the gathering.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.331
Yes. Yes, I would.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.371
I'm going into the village
tomorrow morning.

33:17.871 --> 33:19.669
I'll take you with me
to Mistress Duncan's.

33:45.774 --> 33:50.029
I'd say you need to lay in
a goodly amount of white willow bark.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.414
Eases a whiskey headache.

33:55.617 --> 33:56.618
So, is this your doing,

33:57.202 --> 34:00.251
my sudden but
very welcome visit here?

34:01.540 --> 34:02.757
As I told you,

34:02.832 --> 34:05.255
there's many things in this world
we can't explain.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.636
I heard you made a visit
to the Baxters' after all.

34:10.715 --> 34:14.219
Yes, I got to see
the delightful Father Bain at work.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.971
What a sight that was.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.223
Was the exorcism successful?

34:18.431 --> 34:19.978
I don't know.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.685
I left before it was over.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.731
I do know if Tammas were my child,

34:25.813 --> 34:28.237
I wouldn't leave him
to the tender mercies of that man.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.862
Steer well clear of him, Claire.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.659
There's no mercy
in his Bible or his heart.

34:33.862 --> 34:37.083
He takes the view
that every woman since Eve

34:37.993 --> 34:40.871
is a born temptress
who should be beaten daily

34:40.954 --> 34:43.172
by her husband to keep evil at bay.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.510
Sometimes I feel very much
the stranger in a strange land.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.387
It can't be easy...

34:54.842 --> 34:56.686
Being a Sassenach in the Highlands...

34:59.598 --> 35:01.316
Assuming that's what you mean.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.695
What on earth is going on down there?

35:27.042 --> 35:29.044
Lad was caught stealing, most like...

35:30.086 --> 35:31.963
Usually is with the Tanner's lads.

35:32.881 --> 35:36.181
They've brought him to Arthur
to dispense justice.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.559
If his breakfast had agreed
with him this morning,

35:41.139 --> 35:42.937
lad might have got off
with a whipping.

35:43.725 --> 35:47.730
But since he's most likely
costive or flatulent,

35:48.813 --> 35:51.111
the lad will probably lose his hand.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.280
For stealing?

35:54.903 --> 35:56.371
That's appalling.

36:03.328 --> 36:06.582
I need some peppermint, my dearest.

36:08.875 --> 36:13.096
I canna render judgment
with a roiling gut.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.434
So, you haven't decided
the fate of the boy yet?

36:21.721 --> 36:24.691
This is Claire Beauchamp
from up at the castle.

36:26.476 --> 36:27.728
Oh, yes.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.604
Yes, of course.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.950
Thank you, my darling.

36:42.659 --> 36:45.128
Oh, I believe it's working already.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.801
I don't know what evidence there is
against the boy, but surely...

36:51.876 --> 36:53.378
He's confessed' actually.

36:54.421 --> 36:57.391
Stole two bannocks from his employer.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.515
Father Bain is arguing
for taking his hand.

37:01.511 --> 37:04.355
Says it's the only way
lo save his immortal soul.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.853
But he's just a child.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.317
Surely you're not
going to mutilate him

37:07.392 --> 37:09.394
just for stealing a loaf of bread.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.987
Oh, away.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.034
Arthur...

37:20.989 --> 37:22.206
Imagine...

37:23.199 --> 37:26.419
If our own union had been blessed,

37:27.328 --> 37:30.172
then how would you feel

37:32.041 --> 37:34.260
if your son were taken so?

37:36.504 --> 37:39.758
Surely it was but hunger
that made the lad take to thievery.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.555
Aye.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.595
Aye.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.897
Can you not find it in your heart

37:48.057 --> 37:49.274
to be merciful,

37:49.851 --> 37:52.195
and you the soul of justice?

37:52.270 --> 37:56.070
Oh, my sweet, tender heart.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.578
Since he's confessed,
I canna let him go,

38:01.821 --> 38:03.698
but perhaps

38:04.365 --> 38:06.288
one hour in the pillory

38:06.367 --> 38:09.792
and one ear nailed.

38:13.750 --> 38:17.550
It is you who are tenderhearted.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.813
I've reached a decision, Father Bain.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.769
We seek only justice.

38:33.728 --> 38:34.729
There.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.732
Easily done.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.568
The man has no notion of guile.

38:42.570 --> 38:45.073
What does that mean, one ear nailed?

38:47.534 --> 38:48.706
Nailed to what?

38:50.161 --> 38:51.754
To the pillory, of course.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.754
Better than losing a hand.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.374
Now you'll be absolved.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.802
Let's get these herbs pounded
and put them on to steep.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.140
Then we can go downstairs

39:48.678 --> 39:50.601
and have a nice glass of port

39:51.514 --> 39:53.437
and tell each other all our secrets.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.292
You do puzzle me, Claire.

40:12.201 --> 40:15.455
One would think you don't
have pillories or punishment

40:15.538 --> 40:16.630
where you come from.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.169
It's different there.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.505
Where,

40:25.340 --> 40:26.592
Oxfordshire?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.519
Wouldn't think things
were so different.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.271
It's not just Oxfordshire.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.937
I had an unusual childhood.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.359
I was brought up in lots of places.

40:36.809 --> 40:37.901
Really?

40:39.020 --> 40:40.237
Do tell.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.733
Fascinated to hear all about it.

40:51.491 --> 40:52.993
What is it?

40:53.284 --> 40:54.536
In here.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.372
Mistress Duncan.

40:57.872 --> 40:58.873
Mistress Beauchamp.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.718
Mr. MacTavish.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.174
Dougal was called back to Leoch.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.505
I'm sent to fetch ye.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.465
Brought your cloak to keep you warm.

41:08.216 --> 41:10.560
Mistress Beauchamp
was just about to tell me

41:10.635 --> 41:11.852
of her unusual upbringing.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.647
I'm sure it's a good story.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.896
Why don't you have
a glass of port and listen in?

41:20.770 --> 41:23.148
More time, I would,
but we should leave,

41:23.231 --> 41:25.780
or we'll get naught
but scraps for our dinner.

41:25.858 --> 41:28.156
Thank you for
your hospitality, Geillis,

41:28.236 --> 41:29.613
and for these.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.664
We must do it again.

41:34.742 --> 41:35.914
Of course.

41:37.453 --> 41:38.579
Soon.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.269
How much longer do you think
he'll have to stay there?

41:54.012 --> 41:55.264
He can leave anytime he wants.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.015
His hour is done.

41:57.098 --> 41:58.691
It's just the lad's
not got up the courage

41:58.766 --> 42:00.564
to tear his ear from the nail.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.112
You mean he has to
tear himself loose?

42:03.396 --> 42:04.443
Aye.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.441
He's still a bit nervous,

42:07.108 --> 42:09.202
but he'll set his mind to it
soon enough.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.825
Mr. MacTavish, your fingers,

42:15.116 --> 42:16.914
they're quite strong, I suppose.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.292
Aye.

42:27.462 --> 42:28.839
Now then, Novelli,

42:29.547 --> 42:31.470
got yourself in a right swivet,
have you no?

42:34.677 --> 42:37.521
Yon's no job to be
making heavy weather of.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.604
A wee jouk of the head,
and it's over.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.230
Here, shall I help you?

42:46.314 --> 42:47.315
No, no.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.331
Away home.

43:01.454 --> 43:02.797
She'll be all right,

43:03.790 --> 43:05.838
just doesn't like the sight of blood.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.969
Thank you. I know that was a risk.

43:17.178 --> 43:18.896
You wouldn't expect me
to be less bold

43:18.971 --> 43:21.144
than a wee Sassenach lassie,
now, would you?

43:23.017 --> 43:25.361
Would you be willing
to risk helping me again?

43:26.604 --> 43:28.106
Do you know The Black Kirk?

43:39.492 --> 43:40.914
It's so peaceful.

43:42.245 --> 43:43.997
It's not at all what I expected.

43:44.872 --> 43:47.876
Well, they say Satan's clever.

43:49.377 --> 43:51.300
He'd hardly catch
many unsuspecting souls

43:51.379 --> 43:54.178
if he laid his traps
in bogs and tunnels.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.019
Do you actually believe
demons live in this place?

43:59.846 --> 44:02.315
Well, I know wee Lindsay and Tammas

44:02.390 --> 44:05.860
are not the first boys to sicken
or die after a visit up here.

44:07.687 --> 44:11.191
To tell the truth,
visiting The Black Kirk

44:12.150 --> 44:14.244
and living to tell the tale
is a way to prove your manhood.

44:15.528 --> 44:16.700
Did it myself,

44:17.947 --> 44:20.075
when I was a lad with no harm done,

44:21.325 --> 44:23.168
but my own cousin
fell under the spell

44:23.244 --> 44:24.461
and was sick near a week.

44:24.537 --> 44:26.335
You think demons were responsible?

44:28.291 --> 44:30.259
I'm an educated man, Mistress,

44:30.751 --> 44:31.968
if I may be so bold.

44:34.255 --> 44:36.474
Maybe no as educated as you,

44:38.009 --> 44:39.682
but I had a tutor,

44:42.763 --> 44:44.140
a good one.

44:44.765 --> 44:48.065
He taught me Latin
and Greek and such,

44:49.520 --> 44:51.989
not childhood stories
of fairies, devils,

44:53.733 --> 44:55.201
waterhorses in lochs.

44:57.528 --> 45:01.123
But I am also a Highlander,
born and bred,

45:02.325 --> 45:04.043
and I dinna believe in tempting fate

45:04.118 --> 45:06.871
by making light of Old Nick
in his very own kirkyard.

45:10.208 --> 45:13.963
So when you would come here as a boy
to prove your manhood,

45:14.337 --> 45:15.964
what exactly would you do?

45:16.464 --> 45:17.761
No much.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.468
Caper about, mostly.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.303
Climb the walls.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.898
Maybe defy the devil
by pissing on the stones.

45:26.182 --> 45:28.560
You might be lucky
and find some berries

45:29.185 --> 45:30.357
or wood garlic to eat.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.070
Wood garlic?

45:32.730 --> 45:34.607
- And you'd eat it?
- Aye.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.363
Can you show me?

45:38.027 --> 45:39.529
Oh, I didn't like the taste of it,

45:39.820 --> 45:41.367
but some folks find it a treat.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.411
This isn't wood garlic.

45:44.033 --> 45:46.536
It's <i>Convallaria majalis,</i>
Lily of the valley.

45:47.703 --> 45:49.000
Lily of the valley?

45:50.748 --> 45:52.045
I never heard of it.

45:52.124 --> 45:54.343
That's because
it's not native to Scotland.

45:57.004 --> 45:58.597
The monks that built this place,

45:59.548 --> 46:00.891
were they from Germany by chance?

46:03.511 --> 46:04.512
Germany?

46:06.222 --> 46:07.439
Prussia, I mean.

46:08.975 --> 46:10.022
Aye.

46:11.852 --> 46:13.024
Of course.

46:26.450 --> 46:27.576
Mistress,

46:28.703 --> 46:30.046
the poor bairn is nearly gone.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.213
Satan has claimed his body.

46:34.375 --> 46:37.549
Father Bain can only hope
to save his immortal soul.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.217
I think I can save his life.

46:39.547 --> 46:42.266
I think Lindsay and Tammas ate this.

46:42.425 --> 46:43.426
This is Lily of the valley,

46:43.551 --> 46:45.553
but it looks exactly the same
as wood garlic...

46:45.636 --> 46:46.762
But this is poisonous.

46:47.346 --> 46:49.599
I can give Tammas something
to counteract the poison,

46:49.682 --> 46:50.979
but we have to move quickly.

46:51.058 --> 46:52.526
What blasphemy is this?

46:53.060 --> 46:54.528
Father, I mean no blasphemy.

46:54.603 --> 46:56.947
- I simply...
- I am the Lord's disciple!

46:58.316 --> 47:00.739
You are not ordained
to drive away the demon.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.744
Now, leave this house this instant.

47:02.862 --> 47:05.741
The boy's problem is poison,
not a demon.

47:06.407 --> 47:08.375
And if you don't let me
tend to him, he will die.

47:08.576 --> 47:09.793
Let her pass, Father.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.627
I will not be
ordered about by a woman.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.593
This boy is a slave to Satan

47:18.169 --> 47:19.512
and must be purged

47:19.587 --> 47:22.591
or have his soul doomed
to eternal damnation.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.469
This

47:27.762 --> 47:29.264
is my sisters house,

47:31.098 --> 47:33.442
and my fathers before that,

47:35.186 --> 47:38.781
and we'll decide
what is done under its roof.

47:45.613 --> 47:46.660
Tend to the boy.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.790
I smell the vapors of hell on you.

48:00.252 --> 48:02.004
It's a decoction of belladonna.

48:06.258 --> 48:07.680
<i>If the decoction worked,</i>

48:07.760 --> 48:09.387
<i>It would normalize his heart rate,</i>

48:09.470 --> 48:10.687
<i>lower his blood pressure,</i>

48:10.763 --> 48:12.811
<i>and bring him back
to consciousness within moments.</i>

48:13.849 --> 48:17.399
<i>But if I was wrong about the
dosage or the original poison,</i>

48:18.062 --> 48:19.780
<i>it would cause convulsions</i>

48:19.855 --> 48:22.199
<i>and kill the boy almost as quickly.</i>

48:43.170 --> 48:44.467
Tammas.

48:47.383 --> 48:48.384
Ma.

48:48.676 --> 48:50.394
Oh, my boy!

48:50.970 --> 48:53.348
Oh, he's come back to me.
It's a miracle.

48:53.639 --> 48:54.686
It's a miracle, Father.

48:55.057 --> 48:58.652
God bless you, Mistress.

49:07.862 --> 49:09.910
Satan may like to make a fool of God,

49:11.031 --> 49:12.874
but God will have the last word.

49:18.038 --> 49:19.255
I promise you that.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.347
I truly believe Father Bain
would have preferred

49:27.423 --> 49:29.767
that boy die than me save him.

49:29.842 --> 49:30.843
Aye.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.223
I don't doubt that.

49:32.803 --> 49:35.522
A man's beliefs are
how he makes sense of life,

49:36.056 --> 49:38.730
and if you take that away,
what do you have left?

49:40.561 --> 49:42.655
Is it so different
where you come from?

49:43.898 --> 49:45.400
In that regard, I suppose not.

49:49.862 --> 49:51.489
Well, if it makes you feel better,

49:51.906 --> 49:53.203
Mrs. Fitz now calls you...

49:56.076 --> 49:57.123
The Miracle Worker

49:58.704 --> 49:59.921
Good lord.

50:01.957 --> 50:03.925
At the very least,

50:04.001 --> 50:06.095
I hope I've earned
a measure of trust from Colum.

50:06.545 --> 50:07.592
Aye.

50:10.758 --> 50:12.931
He's taking credit
for bringing you on as healer

50:13.010 --> 50:14.353
to the MacKenzies.

50:15.221 --> 50:18.065
I doubt he'll want to
see you leave anytime soon.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.605
I'll never get out of here.

50:29.443 --> 50:31.195
<i>I almost stayed in my room.</i>

50:32.238 --> 50:33.956
<i>I had no desire to see that mixture</i>

50:34.073 --> 50:37.418
<i>of awe and suspicion that seemed to
follow me everywhere now.</i>

50:39.495 --> 50:41.839
<i>It only heightened
the feeling of hopelessness</i>

50:41.914 --> 50:45.293
<i>about my situation
that had come crashing down on me.</i>

50:47.294 --> 50:49.922
<i>I had performed
what was being called a miracle,</i>

50:50.798 --> 50:52.766
<i>but instead of buying me my release,</i>

50:52.841 --> 50:55.219
<i>it had tightened my bonds
to this place.</i>

50:55.970 --> 50:59.315
<i>And even if I did get away,
get back to the stones,</i>

51:00.224 --> 51:02.477
<i>I had no guarantee
it would work again,</i>

51:02.560 --> 51:04.153
<i>whatever it was.</i>

51:04.937 --> 51:06.359
<i>And if it did work,</i>

51:06.438 --> 51:09.112
<i>there was no guarantee
that I would get back home.</i>

51:09.817 --> 51:11.865
<i>Couldn't I just as easily
be hunted back in time</i>

51:11.944 --> 51:16.165
<i>yet again to the Middle Ages
or even the Roman Occupation?</i>

51:17.575 --> 51:19.669
<i>What finally brought me
out of my room</i>

51:20.244 --> 51:22.872
<i>was the oblivion promised
by Colum's rhenish.</i>

51:25.249 --> 51:27.547
Over here. You dinna see me waving?

51:28.294 --> 51:29.841
Nearly reinjured my arm.

51:31.839 --> 51:35.013
Stay low and quiet,
or they're likely to stone us.

51:44.935 --> 51:47.609
Now this one is about a man out late

51:48.230 --> 51:50.904
on a fairy hill,
on the eve of Samhain,

51:51.358 --> 51:55.113
who hears the sound
of a woman singing sad and plaintive,

51:55.779 --> 51:57.201
from the very rocks of the hill.

52:10.711 --> 52:12.384
<i>"I am a woman of Balnain.</i>

52:13.797 --> 52:16.391
"The folk have stolen me over again,

52:18.135 --> 52:19.728
"the stones seemed to say.

52:21.180 --> 52:24.229
<i>"I stood upon the hill,
and wind did rise,</i>

52:25.309 --> 52:28.859
<i>"and the sound o? thunder
rolled across the land.</i>

52:32.775 --> 52:35.574
"I placed my hands
upon the tallest stone

52:35.653 --> 52:38.327
"and traveled to a far, distant land,

52:39.657 --> 52:42.331
"where I lived for a time
among strangers

52:43.160 --> 52:46.084
"who became lovers and friends.

52:52.419 --> 52:55.548
"But one day,
I saw the moon came out

52:55.923 --> 52:57.766
<i>"and the wind rose once more.</i>

52:58.926 --> 53:00.599
<i>“So, I touched the stones</i>

53:01.261 --> 53:03.514
<i>"and traveled back to my own land</i>

53:04.932 --> 53:06.934
"and took up again with the man

53:07.017 --> 53:08.769
"I had left behind."

53:10.938 --> 53:12.940
She came back through the stones?

53:15.359 --> 53:16.702
Aye, she did.

53:18.278 --> 53:19.780
They always do.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.664
<i>It was a folktale,</i>

53:22.741 --> 53:24.493
<i>madness to take as fact,</i>

53:24.952 --> 53:27.330
<i>and yet half of what
Gwyllyn had described</i>

53:27.413 --> 53:29.461
<i>had actually happened to me.</i>

53:33.293 --> 53:34.966
<i>Why not the other half,</i>

53:36.797 --> 53:38.799
<i>the part where the woman
returned home?</i>

53:43.470 --> 53:44.687
<i>What had Geillis said?</i>

53:45.180 --> 53:46.602
As I told you,

53:46.765 --> 53:49.314
there's many things
in this world we can't explain.

53:50.477 --> 53:52.445
<i>My heart suddenly lightened,</i>

53:52.521 --> 53:54.364
<i>and I knew in that moment</i>

53:54.440 --> 53:57.660
<i>I could no longer wait
for permission or assistance.</i>

53:58.652 --> 54:00.700
<i>I must escape Castle Leach</i>

54:01.363 --> 54:03.707
<i>and get back to the stones
as soon as possible</i>

54:04.658 --> 54:06.035
<i>or die trying.</i>

54:09.000 --> 54:17.000
