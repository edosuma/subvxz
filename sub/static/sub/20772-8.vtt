WEBVTT

00:01.117 --> 00:02.717
Previously on "Casual"...

00:02.718 --> 00:05.999
- We have a rat!
- Jack is bringing traps.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.866
I miss us, and I know
that with my celibacy,

00:08.867 --> 00:10.828
that I couldn't ask you to try again,

00:10.829 --> 00:13.459
but I want to... try again.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.630
You and Casey seem really close.

00:15.631 --> 00:17.132
Yeah, I guess so.

00:17.133 --> 00:18.386
Something going on with you two?

00:18.387 --> 00:19.971
What do you mean?

00:19.972 --> 00:21.934
You know, you have a tendency

00:21.935 --> 00:25.023
to sort of complicate
relationships with sex.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.862
Wow, that's so sad
that's what you think of me.

00:27.863 --> 00:30.451
My girlfriend, she's
threatening to go full Ophelia.

00:30.452 --> 00:32.622
You are shouldering too much weight.

00:32.622 --> 00:35.001
Just tell Val. She'll understand.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.172
Mom told me you have a half brother.

00:39.052 --> 00:40.805
It's crazy, right?

00:40.806 --> 00:44.103
I have to...
take a rain check on this game.

00:44.104 --> 00:45.940
I've had a really long week,
and I'm so tired.

00:45.941 --> 00:48.111
- Did you talk to Val?
- Mm-hmm.

00:48.112 --> 00:49.614
What, weight lifted or...

00:49.615 --> 00:51.453
No, not exactly.

01:44.976 --> 01:46.561
Ahhh!

01:46.562 --> 01:47.897
Ah!

02:05.349 --> 02:06.935
Fuck!

02:06.936 --> 02:09.189
Okay, all right. This is fine.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.735
It's a terrible mistake,
but we were drunk

02:10.735 --> 02:12.864
and high on rat death euphoria.

02:12.865 --> 02:14.868
- Oh, gross!
- Gross?

02:14.869 --> 02:16.663
Oh, a fucking bro, Rae...

02:16.664 --> 02:18.834
Please tell me we didn't fuck
to Matchbox 20.

02:18.835 --> 02:20.546
How dare you?

02:20.547 --> 02:22.174
God. Don't look at me. Turn.

02:22.175 --> 02:23.844
I've already seen everything.

02:23.845 --> 02:25.806
Do you remember it?

02:25.807 --> 02:27.309
Not really.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.104
I've got perfect nipples. Turn.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.150
- All right.
- Gross.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.489
God, you look like the villain
from "Legally Blonde."

02:33.490 --> 02:34.908
Gross.

02:34.909 --> 02:36.620
You said "gross" three times now.

02:36.621 --> 02:39.041
All right! Don't.
Don't look. Don't look.

02:39.042 --> 02:40.544
Look, I'm just saying this as a friend.

02:40.545 --> 02:43.426
You should buy a toenail clipper, okay?

God damn it.

03:00.836 --> 03:03.339
God, shut the fuck up, oven.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.135
I see you two have finally met.

03:05.136 --> 03:07.097
Surprise!

03:07.098 --> 03:09.352
Ugh! Is this pathetic or what?

03:09.353 --> 03:11.440
It depends what you're trying to do.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.398
Well, I'm trying to do
a room service thing,

03:15.423 --> 03:17.493
since you used to love that,
but we don't have any trays.

03:17.494 --> 03:19.121
Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm not hungry.

03:19.122 --> 03:20.958
You're not? What?

03:20.959 --> 03:22.712
I mean, you don't want anything?

03:22.713 --> 03:24.089
No, I'm good.

03:24.090 --> 03:25.551
I hate to waste it.

03:25.552 --> 03:27.053
Oh, I'll pay you back for it.

03:27.054 --> 03:28.432
I don't want you to pay me back.

03:28.433 --> 03:30.268
Mom, I'm fucking with you.

03:30.269 --> 03:31.606
I don't make any money, remember?

03:48.950 --> 03:51.787
Rule number one: Never fuck a roommate.

03:51.812 --> 03:54.526
I should be restrained at night,

03:54.527 --> 03:56.237
chained to the wall like the Wolfman.

03:56.238 --> 03:57.907
That was Benicio, right?

03:57.908 --> 03:59.452
And Emily Blunt phoning it in?

03:59.453 --> 04:01.373
How far we've come.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.835
Okay, I need to re-home her.
Can she stay here?

04:03.836 --> 04:05.381
Not if she's in heat.

04:05.382 --> 04:07.259
Come on. I need a game plan.

04:07.260 --> 04:09.137
Why don't you make her breakfast

04:09.138 --> 04:11.016
and have an honest conversation
about what happened?

04:11.017 --> 04:12.269
No, terrible idea.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.480
Agreed. Ignore her.

04:13.481 --> 04:15.275
Normalize the transgression,

04:15.276 --> 04:16.736
and gaslight her
if she brings it up again.

04:16.737 --> 04:18.824
- Laura.
- You should run for office.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.201
So what are we doing today?

04:20.202 --> 04:21.954
Korean barbecue? Shooting range?

04:21.956 --> 04:23.834
Korean barbecue <i>at</i> a shooting range?

04:23.835 --> 04:25.504
Well, Laura and I are looking forward

04:25.505 --> 04:27.425
to doing a staycation kind of thing.

04:27.426 --> 04:29.094
We're gonna just watch TV...

04:29.095 --> 04:31.015
Actually, I'm heading over to Dad's,

04:31.016 --> 04:34.021
but I will take this donut, thank you.

04:34.022 --> 04:36.818
Hey, are you sure it was Rae you fucked?

04:36.819 --> 04:38.864
Or was it Tybalt, the sorcerer?

04:38.865 --> 04:40.493
Ha ha ha.

04:43.081 --> 04:44.667
Did you know

04:44.668 --> 04:46.504
that for a large portion
of his adult life,

04:46.505 --> 04:48.383
Jack Nicholson thought
his grandmother was his mom

04:48.384 --> 04:49.802
and his mom was his sister?

04:49.803 --> 04:51.640
Oh.

04:51.641 --> 04:55.021
That why you didn't tell me about
my half brother, the mystery guy?

04:55.022 --> 04:57.944
Afraid of upending
my thriving acting career?

04:59.615 --> 05:00.991
I just wasn't sure
you would want to know.

05:00.992 --> 05:02.411
Oh, really? Oh, thank you.

05:02.412 --> 05:03.956
Thank you.

05:03.957 --> 05:06.043
But now that I do know,

05:06.044 --> 05:08.130
I should probably look into it, right?

05:08.131 --> 05:10.134
I mean, for Laura's sake?

05:10.135 --> 05:12.724
In case she needs a kidney or something?

05:13.977 --> 05:15.813
Yeah, good thinking.

05:15.814 --> 05:18.317
Probably best to start
harvesting those organs now.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.948
Yeah.

05:20.949 --> 05:23.078
I really should.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.938
Hey.

05:36.939 --> 05:39.109
Hi.

05:39.110 --> 05:40.654
Cool place.

05:40.655 --> 05:43.284
Thanks. Happy to provide asylum.

05:43.285 --> 05:44.495
How's your mom?

05:44.496 --> 05:46.541
Well, I'll head back home

05:46.542 --> 05:49.338
as soon as her bitterness fades
to exhaustion.

05:50.340 --> 05:52.595
Jane, Dylan, Nigel, Laura.

05:52.596 --> 05:54.766
Hi.

05:54.767 --> 05:57.855
So what's on tap for the day?

05:57.856 --> 05:59.692
Well, I have this interview thing,

05:59.693 --> 06:01.988
but you're welcome to hang
as long as you'd like.

06:01.989 --> 06:04.327
Cool.

06:06.665 --> 06:09.086
Um, you have...

06:09.087 --> 06:11.006
Do... do you need...

06:11.007 --> 06:14.555
A tampon? No, not really my thing.

06:14.556 --> 06:16.016
Gotcha.

06:16.017 --> 06:18.648
That's... cutting out the middleman.

06:20.025 --> 06:21.528
Hon? You're up in the shower.

06:21.529 --> 06:22.822
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:22.823 --> 06:24.909
- Elena, Laura.
- Hi.

06:24.910 --> 06:27.957
Oh, you're Casey's girlfriend. Hi.

06:27.958 --> 06:29.710
Her wife.

06:29.711 --> 06:31.714
Oh.

06:31.715 --> 06:32.884
It's nice to meet you.

07:08.456 --> 07:11.084
Oh, hi. It's Alex Cole calling.

07:11.085 --> 07:14.174
No, this has nothing to do
with reverse mortgages.

07:14.175 --> 07:16.721
Yeah, I'm Dawn Cole's son,

07:16.722 --> 07:21.146
trying to contact old friends,
lovers, whatever.

07:21.147 --> 07:22.900
Is Gary there?

07:22.901 --> 07:24.987
No, I'm not asking for money.

07:27.159 --> 07:28.620
You know what? Forget it.

07:28.621 --> 07:30.667
Enjoy the time you have left.

07:37.346 --> 07:38.807
Hi.

07:38.808 --> 07:40.769
Hiya.

07:40.770 --> 07:42.857
Hello, young man.

07:44.444 --> 07:46.196
That's a fun and loud toy.

07:46.197 --> 07:49.370
I'm training him
for future government work.

07:49.371 --> 07:52.668
Clark, honey, why don't you play
one of your games, okay?

07:52.669 --> 07:54.463
I don't normally bring him
to the office,

07:54.464 --> 07:56.634
but his dad's running
a bit behind today.

07:56.635 --> 07:58.847
- Dad's not coming.
- Yes, he is, Bear.

07:58.848 --> 08:00.057
You always say that.

08:00.058 --> 08:01.769
Seven out of the last ten times,

08:01.770 --> 08:03.230
he hasn't shown up at all.

08:03.231 --> 08:05.485
He's very good at data collection.

08:05.486 --> 08:08.450
Can he spreadsheet? Put him on payroll.

08:08.451 --> 08:10.370
I wish, but child labor laws.

08:10.371 --> 08:11.914
I'd go to jail, and he'd just end up

08:11.915 --> 08:13.877
dating bacon-withholding women.

08:13.878 --> 08:15.839
- This is so boring!
- Clark...

08:15.840 --> 08:17.551
I hate your office.

08:17.552 --> 08:19.430
Do you really want Alex
to see you like this?

08:19.431 --> 08:22.310
This guy? I don't care about him.

08:22.311 --> 08:23.730
- Clark.
- It's okay.

08:23.731 --> 08:24.982
I don't care about me either.

08:24.983 --> 08:28.072
I'm just gonna... Yeah.

08:28.073 --> 08:29.575
Sorry.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.288
You know, maybe just to spite Alex,

08:32.289 --> 08:36.337
I'll track down my half brother
and throw him a party.

08:36.339 --> 08:37.883
Do it as a pay-per-view event,

08:37.884 --> 08:39.511
and charge money, make a little cash.

08:39.513 --> 08:40.764
Yeah.

08:40.765 --> 08:43.268
Nah, never gonna look for him.

08:43.269 --> 08:44.605
Really?

08:44.606 --> 08:46.191
No, it's a no-win.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.448
I mean, if he's happy and successful,

08:49.449 --> 08:51.201
it'll just be this painful reminder

08:51.202 --> 08:52.538
of what could have been.

08:52.539 --> 08:54.207
If they're a bunch of losers,

08:54.208 --> 08:55.669
then you got to worry
about shared genes.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.255
Yeah, exactly.

08:57.256 --> 08:59.468
Best-case scenario is, they're normal,

08:59.469 --> 09:01.514
which would be just boring.

09:01.515 --> 09:03.267
Don't you kind of want to know

09:03.268 --> 09:04.895
what your original surname is, though?

09:04.896 --> 09:07.024
Like, what if you have
an awesome last name

09:07.025 --> 09:09.780
like Bonvillain or McClintock?

09:09.781 --> 09:12.953
- What if you're a McClintock?
- I don't know. It could be terrible.

09:12.954 --> 09:14.999
I knew a Gracie Cumster
in middle school.

09:16.252 --> 09:18.255
Oh, whoa.

09:18.256 --> 09:20.176
- What?
- Uh...

09:20.177 --> 09:22.973
- Mapplethorpe?
- Oh, shit, of course.

09:22.974 --> 09:24.560
What kind of Mapplethorpe
we talking about here?

09:24.561 --> 09:26.856
I don't know. Is it portraits, sculptures?

09:26.857 --> 09:28.108
Tulips and assholes.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.739
Oh, got the whole potpourri.

09:30.740 --> 09:32.116
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

09:32.117 --> 09:33.285
- You know what?
- What?

09:33.286 --> 09:34.580
- I hate tulips.
- Really?

09:34.581 --> 09:36.131
Yeah, it's a terrible flower.

09:36.156 --> 09:38.665
And my great-great-great-great-
great-grandmother was Dutch.

09:38.690 --> 09:40.485
- What?
- And when the bubble burst,

09:40.510 --> 09:42.827
she got real fucked.
She was on the streets for a while.

09:42.852 --> 09:44.773
She took a hit. Yeah, yeah.

09:44.798 --> 09:46.120
- So I can't do this.
- I'm so sorry.

09:46.145 --> 09:48.417
Thank you. Yeah, out of
principle, I shouldn't do this.

09:48.442 --> 09:50.820
- Yeah, no Mapplethorpe.
- No Mapplethorpe.

09:50.821 --> 09:52.866
- How about coffee?
- We could do coffee.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.453
- Okay.
- And talk about...

09:54.454 --> 09:57.208
- Hey, we're not gonna do Mapplethorpe.
- No.

09:57.209 --> 10:00.465
As much as you guys try to make us,
we're not gonna do it, okay?

10:00.466 --> 10:02.343
Kitchen's just like the one
in "Downton Abbey"

10:02.344 --> 10:03.972
but less modern.

10:03.973 --> 10:06.226
Oh, is it private enough
for hushed gossip

10:06.227 --> 10:07.479
about the Crawleys?

10:07.480 --> 10:09.358
Did you hear

10:09.359 --> 10:10.610
Lady Edith was sent to hospital again

10:10.611 --> 10:12.071
for fucking another horse?

10:12.072 --> 10:13.449
That's ten this week.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.160
My goodness.

10:15.161 --> 10:17.749
Speaking of...

10:17.750 --> 10:19.795
Oh, you're just gonna saunter
through here, dick swinging,

10:19.796 --> 10:21.799
like you didn't use
all our hot water again.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.178
And I'm invisible.

10:24.179 --> 10:25.264
What am I? Elena?

10:25.265 --> 10:26.976
Dude, seriously.

10:26.977 --> 10:29.773
Usually Casey at least
mentions the green card.

10:29.774 --> 10:32.069
Which is super insulting, by the way.

10:32.070 --> 10:33.906
They don't fuck
like a green card marriage.

10:33.907 --> 10:35.535
Now I feel bad,

10:35.536 --> 10:37.246
like maybe I missed something she said.

10:37.247 --> 10:39.835
Oh, doubt it. Casey's like a dude.

10:39.836 --> 10:42.298
Adjusting the facts as she pleases.

10:42.299 --> 10:43.760
And gone three nights a week.

10:43.761 --> 10:45.262
Well, I'm pretty sure

10:45.263 --> 10:46.807
she's just sleeping at work, right?

10:46.808 --> 10:48.895
On a pillow of intern vagina.

10:48.896 --> 10:50.314
Classy.

10:50.315 --> 10:51.817
You watch lactation porn.

10:51.818 --> 10:52.986
Wait, what?

10:52.987 --> 10:55.492
Aw, you homesick, Dylan?

10:55.493 --> 10:58.748
Oh, shit.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.340
Just, I am trying to talk to you.

11:07.057 --> 11:10.270
- Just stop.
- Here we go again.

11:10.271 --> 11:12.025
Yeah.

11:18.414 --> 11:20.500
Yeah, I'm here.

11:20.501 --> 11:22.294
No, I'm not Valerie.

11:22.295 --> 11:25.050
I'm looking for her
baptismal birth certificate.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.721
Hang on just a sec.

11:26.722 --> 11:28.892
Hello?

11:30.479 --> 11:33.191
Eric doesn't work here anymore.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.156
Hello? You there?

11:36.157 --> 11:37.868
Pastor?

11:37.869 --> 11:39.120
Come on.

11:39.121 --> 11:40.999
Clark, please, just...

11:41.000 --> 11:43.211
You were supposed to take me
to the aquarium, Mom.

11:43.212 --> 11:45.132
I know, but I...
what do you want me to do?

11:45.133 --> 11:46.217
What can I do?

11:46.218 --> 11:47.972
What can I...

11:48.974 --> 11:50.727
Clark.

11:50.728 --> 11:52.647
I mean, I've only known
the guy for nine years,

11:52.648 --> 11:53.983
and I knew he'd blow it.

11:53.984 --> 11:55.487
What's your excuse?

11:59.370 --> 12:00.663
Take it. I got this.

12:00.664 --> 12:02.959
Ugh, thank you.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.839
This is Judy.

12:12.103 --> 12:13.564
Aquarium, huh?

12:13.565 --> 12:15.150
What's the point?

12:15.151 --> 12:17.656
Global warming's gonna get us anyway.

12:17.657 --> 12:19.451
You're right.

12:19.452 --> 12:22.081
But Florida will be the first to go,

12:22.082 --> 12:23.291
literally underwater,

12:23.292 --> 12:25.045
27 electoral votes set free,

12:25.046 --> 12:28.511
which shifts the map,
maybe slows things.

12:28.512 --> 12:30.264
- Still...
- I know.

12:30.265 --> 12:32.101
Even if we fix it all tomorrow,

12:32.102 --> 12:34.105
the sun will still expand,
boil our surface water,

12:34.106 --> 12:35.984
and turn our planet into Venus.

12:35.985 --> 12:37.529
Scary and inevitable.

12:37.530 --> 12:41.244
But given our history of innovation,

12:41.245 --> 12:44.918
maybe our descendants,
even your anxious grandchildren,

12:44.919 --> 12:48.049
will have found a way
to move on to other planets.

12:48.050 --> 12:50.388
I guess that's kind of cool.

12:50.389 --> 12:52.224
That's very cool.

12:52.225 --> 12:54.980
And the interplanetary exodus,

12:54.981 --> 12:56.609
total bonding moment.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.446
There'll be a space-wide love fest.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.373
Hang on.

13:05.209 --> 13:07.464
Hello.

13:07.465 --> 13:10.010
Oh, Gary!

13:10.011 --> 13:11.472
My man!

13:11.473 --> 13:12.557
Yes! Can you email me the photo?

13:12.558 --> 13:14.268
All right, yes.

13:14.269 --> 13:16.523
Great. You're an absolute lifesaver.

13:16.524 --> 13:17.776
Here we go!

13:17.777 --> 13:18.986
Photo of who?

13:18.987 --> 13:21.032
My sister's birth father,

13:21.033 --> 13:25.332
who is...

13:25.333 --> 13:26.669
Not that guy.

13:26.670 --> 13:28.631
Shit.

13:28.632 --> 13:30.468
Oh, man.

13:30.469 --> 13:32.847
Okay, okay.

13:32.848 --> 13:34.518
What do we know?

13:34.519 --> 13:36.438
Val's born in '76.
Mom's already a groupie.

13:36.439 --> 13:38.401
- What's a groupie?
- A slut for musicians.

13:38.402 --> 13:41.280
- Like John Mayer?
- Exactly, yeah.

13:41.281 --> 13:45.122
Now, who was Mom stalking in '75?

13:45.123 --> 13:46.709
"Born to Run" is out,

13:46.710 --> 13:49.213
but E Street Band's a boys' club.

13:49.214 --> 13:51.427
Kiss, maybe?

13:51.428 --> 13:54.098
No, Mom frightens too easily.

13:54.099 --> 13:56.937
'75, '75, '75.

13:56.938 --> 13:58.774
Oh, yes. Fleetwood Mac.

13:58.775 --> 14:01.028
Who's Fleetwood Mac?

14:01.029 --> 14:03.283
Who's Fleetwood Mac?

14:03.284 --> 14:06.289
Jeez, look at this
incredible awkwardness here.

14:06.290 --> 14:07.709
"Plan going as intended.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.336
"I'll get her

14:09.337 --> 14:11.759
"some very early-morning
Cabernet Sauvignons

14:11.760 --> 14:14.096
and impress her with the fact
that I know the word 'Matisse.'"

14:14.097 --> 14:16.225
- Mm-hmm.
- Little fake phone call alert.

14:16.226 --> 14:18.439
"Please, somebody call me.
Somebody be dead."

14:18.440 --> 14:20.526
And just like that,

14:20.527 --> 14:23.741
we've run out of everything to say.

14:23.742 --> 14:26.205
- Try one of these.
- Hmm? Oh.

14:27.958 --> 14:30.547
- They're good, huh?
- Oh, very good.

14:32.217 --> 14:38.979
So I don't mean to sound overly
clinical here, but, um...

14:38.980 --> 14:42.152
how is... how's this gonna work?

14:42.153 --> 14:45.451
I mean, obviously, no penetration.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.870
Shoving meat in your mouth

14:46.871 --> 14:48.457
was a little suggestive, wasn't it?

14:48.458 --> 14:51.003
Just a smidge, maybe.

14:51.004 --> 14:54.134
I... we're waiting.

14:54.135 --> 14:55.930
Right.

14:55.931 --> 14:57.892
- That's all.
- Uh-huh.

14:57.893 --> 15:01.232
Is anybody else... waiting?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.444
Just you.

15:04.322 --> 15:07.954
And... and we're waiting because...

15:07.955 --> 15:10.835
- I'm rewiring.
- Yes, right.

15:10.836 --> 15:13.549
'Cause I want, you know,
the next time around

15:13.550 --> 15:15.218
to be about us.

15:15.219 --> 15:18.976
I want the sex to be,
you know, about us.

15:18.977 --> 15:21.523
Yeah. Thank you.

15:21.524 --> 15:22.567
- That's great.
- Yeah.

15:22.568 --> 15:24.488
Yes.

15:26.074 --> 15:27.619
I mean, it's just,

15:27.620 --> 15:30.791
when I think about our time together,

15:30.792 --> 15:34.633
it was spent doing... things.

15:34.634 --> 15:38.348
And I just... I'm trying to picture

15:38.349 --> 15:45.278
how to be with you
and not do those things.

15:45.279 --> 15:47.115
But there's... we can do
different things.

15:47.116 --> 15:49.537
There's, you know, knitting, gardening.

15:49.538 --> 15:51.082
- Those are all on the table.
- Right.

15:51.083 --> 15:54.506
Board games. Most board games, anyway.

15:54.507 --> 15:58.807
And we can do things
like this, you know.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.065
Yeah.

16:23.773 --> 16:26.737
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:26.738 --> 16:30.201
Aw, Alex would love this rug.

16:30.202 --> 16:31.997
How's he holding up?

16:31.998 --> 16:34.669
Uh, tortured,

16:34.670 --> 16:36.590
living a life of unspeakable privilege

16:36.591 --> 16:39.763
and just depressed enough to resent it.

16:39.764 --> 16:40.848
Who's Alex?

16:40.849 --> 16:42.602
Oh, her uncle.

16:42.603 --> 16:44.606
His house has incredible water pressure.

16:46.151 --> 16:47.488
Oh, that's Ben.

16:55.545 --> 16:58.091
I really love your house.

16:58.092 --> 17:00.554
Make yourself at home.

17:00.555 --> 17:01.848
Right, so you want
to talk about burners?

17:01.849 --> 17:03.059
We'll talk about burners.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.063
You want to talk about fracking?

17:05.064 --> 17:06.441
I want to talk about the
city council meeting next week.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.945
Oh, okay, whatever you want.

17:08.946 --> 17:10.907
Um, if you get bored,

17:10.909 --> 17:13.287
there's mailers in the living room or...

17:13.288 --> 17:15.417
Cool. I'm on it.

17:21.848 --> 17:23.851
Frequently employing photographs

17:23.852 --> 17:25.479
from local publications,

17:25.480 --> 17:27.483
Jude constructs a visual language

17:27.483 --> 17:30.029
that, placed in sequence, tells a story

17:30.054 --> 17:34.075
that might seem out of place,
mysterious...

17:36.419 --> 17:38.589
the duality of the urban and rural,

17:38.590 --> 17:42.304
the bustle of city life
and the solitude of the outdoors

17:42.305 --> 17:44.392
often juxtaposed in a single frame.

17:44.393 --> 17:47.398
Born in Los Angeles in 1965

17:47.399 --> 17:49.234
but raised in rural Idaho,

17:49.235 --> 17:52.324
Jude took inspiration
from his dichotic upbringing

17:52.325 --> 17:54.621
for his landscapes, portraits...

17:54.622 --> 17:56.332
Excuse me.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.835
Snapshot of America

17:57.836 --> 17:59.213
captured in democratic and observant...

17:59.214 --> 18:00.716
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

18:00.717 --> 18:02.720
The world of his childhood.

18:02.721 --> 18:06.853
In the desert, Jude explores
some of his earliest memories.

18:06.854 --> 18:08.565
They were the biggest,

18:08.566 --> 18:10.528
and they didn't need
the internet to get there.

18:10.529 --> 18:13.241
"Rumors" sold 10 million copies
in its first year.

18:13.242 --> 18:15.579
That is a staggering number.

18:15.580 --> 18:19.169
Justin Bieber's last album
streamed 750 million times.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.631
Mm-hmm, don't ever mention them

18:20.632 --> 18:21.675
in the same sentence again.

18:21.676 --> 18:23.261
Sorry.

18:23.262 --> 18:25.558
Now, "Tusk" sold
4 million copies, a ton,

18:25.559 --> 18:27.018
but that was considered a failure.

18:27.019 --> 18:28.855
That's how big Fleetwood Mac was.

18:28.856 --> 18:30.609
And the entire time...
I'm talking decades here...

18:30.610 --> 18:33.197
they were partying harder than anyone.

18:33.198 --> 18:36.036
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:36.037 --> 18:38.792
Why are you giving
my nine-year-old a music sermon?

18:38.793 --> 18:41.255
We're trying to find
Alex's sister's dad.

18:41.256 --> 18:42.508
Oh.

18:42.509 --> 18:44.052
Is your mom still alive?

18:44.053 --> 18:46.016
I think so.

18:47.184 --> 18:49.104
Could you ask her?

18:49.105 --> 18:51.610
But we've been having so much fun.

18:55.785 --> 18:57.913
You really should ask her.

18:57.914 --> 19:00.419
I know, Clark.

19:00.420 --> 19:03.634
1880 from Paris's
Museum of Decorative Arts,

19:03.635 --> 19:05.512
Rodin's sculpture depicts a scene

19:05.513 --> 19:07.349
from "The Inferno,"

19:07.350 --> 19:10.188
the first section
of Dante's "Divine Comedy."

19:10.189 --> 19:12.401
The shades, or the souls of the damned,

19:12.402 --> 19:15.198
were meant to stand
at the entrance to hell,

19:15.199 --> 19:17.243
staring down at those who would enter.

19:17.244 --> 19:19.874
Asked to conceive
of an inviting entrance

19:19.875 --> 19:21.753
to a planned decorative arts museum,

19:21.754 --> 19:23.632
Rodin chose the shades

19:23.633 --> 19:25.301
but was unable to complete the project

19:25.302 --> 19:28.433
before his death in 1917.

19:28.434 --> 19:31.856
Even before this commission,
Rodin had developed...

19:36.157 --> 19:38.119
Too divorced from reality.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.289
Printed in "Le Matin" in 1890,

19:40.290 --> 19:41.961
Rodin said, "For a"...

20:03.614 --> 20:04.845
Where'd he go?

20:04.962 --> 20:07.549
Oh, he said something

20:07.574 --> 20:10.434
about an asshole with bad
taste in music and took off.

20:10.435 --> 20:11.728
Oh, that's funny.

20:11.729 --> 20:13.314
Bathroom.

20:13.315 --> 20:15.151
I'm sending you a playlist.

20:15.152 --> 20:17.448
Make sure he listens to it in order.

20:17.449 --> 20:18.825
No shuffling, no skipping,

20:18.826 --> 20:20.328
as it was meant to be heard.

20:20.329 --> 20:22.248
Did you put any Foreigner on there?

20:22.249 --> 20:24.880
Watch it.

20:26.049 --> 20:27.551
Hey, have you thought about

20:27.552 --> 20:29.931
limiting his internet use?

20:29.932 --> 20:32.603
I think it might be making him paranoid.

20:32.604 --> 20:34.649
Hmm, I heard

20:34.650 --> 20:37.029
that Florida's doomed
and we're turning into Venus.

20:38.323 --> 20:40.452
But what was that? Less internet?

20:40.453 --> 20:42.873
I should write that down.

20:42.874 --> 20:46.172
- Good night, Judy.
- Godspeed.

21:12.976 --> 21:15.606
Can we go?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.652
- Yeah.
- Leave?

21:22.161 --> 21:24.332
Are you okay?

21:25.668 --> 21:28.548
You know, the end of my marriage

21:28.549 --> 21:30.636
was a relationship without sex,

21:30.637 --> 21:34.685
and it was not pretty.

21:34.686 --> 21:38.067
I felt really alone

21:38.068 --> 21:41.156
and undesired,

21:41.157 --> 21:44.287
and I just... I just don't think

21:44.288 --> 21:47.544
I should start something new
in that place.

21:47.545 --> 21:48.964
That's not us, though.

21:48.965 --> 21:52.136
But I... I think the smartest thing

21:52.137 --> 21:57.021
is to table this until
you're on the other side.

21:57.022 --> 21:58.775
Oh.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.656
Okay. Um...

22:01.657 --> 22:03.033
I feel like this asshole

22:03.034 --> 22:04.578
who's just throwing pebbles

22:04.579 --> 22:06.582
at the window of your halfway house

22:06.583 --> 22:08.753
and begging you to come out
and do an eight-ball with me,

22:08.754 --> 22:11.843
and nobody likes that guy,
including that guy.

22:11.844 --> 22:14.222
I get that, and I appreciate it,

22:14.223 --> 22:16.018
but what do you want?

22:16.019 --> 22:17.521
You want to take a few months off

22:17.522 --> 22:18.941
and see where we're at or something?

22:20.486 --> 22:22.449
I think that would be best.

22:26.330 --> 22:28.251
Okay.

22:29.546 --> 22:31.007
Okay.

22:33.344 --> 22:37.352
Uh, so I guess I'll see you around.

23:10.586 --> 23:13.424
You know...

23:13.425 --> 23:15.344
I was like you...

23:15.345 --> 23:19.688
20, trying to make my mark.

23:20.898 --> 23:24.697
But it left me lonely.

23:24.698 --> 23:26.617
And then I meet this woman

23:26.618 --> 23:32.170
who suddenly treats me
like I have something to offer,

23:32.171 --> 23:35.803
like I can make things happen.

23:37.765 --> 23:39.476
One morning, there's a knock on my door,

23:39.477 --> 23:43.233
and... and she's holding
this Joni Mitchell CD,

23:43.234 --> 23:46.114
tells me to listen to the song "If,"

23:46.115 --> 23:50.080
based on the Rudyard Kipling poem.

23:50.081 --> 23:53.588
Kipling says that
if you endure long enough,

23:53.589 --> 23:55.299
you inherit the Earth,

23:55.300 --> 23:58.180
but Joni Mitchell says
that that's bullshit,

23:58.181 --> 24:01.269
that young people need to wake up,

24:01.270 --> 24:05.695
fight.

24:05.696 --> 24:08.952
She makes you cum in ways
that you never thought possible.

24:08.953 --> 24:13.586
She performs Reiki
that cures your migraines.

24:13.587 --> 24:15.590
She cries mid-story, and you think

24:15.591 --> 24:20.684
that you're the only one
who's ever seen her tears.

24:20.685 --> 24:24.483
And then, like the Sun, she sets on you,

24:24.484 --> 24:27.196
shines on someone else.

24:27.197 --> 24:29.369
That's just what she does.

24:32.124 --> 24:35.213
I've never had a migraine.

24:37.802 --> 24:40.599
Lucky you.

24:57.633 --> 24:59.636
Good news and bad news.

24:59.637 --> 25:02.809
Bad news: Your biological dad
is no longer with us. Sorry.

25:02.810 --> 25:04.521
It was a car accident, though,

25:04.522 --> 25:07.151
not some scary genetic thing,
so that's good.

25:07.152 --> 25:08.654
That said, if you want to spit in a cup,

25:08.655 --> 25:10.367
I'm happy to go down that road for you.

25:10.368 --> 25:16.044
Anyway, good news:
I found your half brother.

25:16.045 --> 25:18.716
And he's in Fresno,
which is weird but great.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.970
It's close.

25:20.971 --> 25:23.266
And I mapped out some stuff
for us to do along the way.

25:23.267 --> 25:25.229
They've got yurts,

25:25.230 --> 25:27.859
three-star glamping.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.780
No.

25:29.781 --> 25:31.409
I thought you wanted this.

25:31.410 --> 25:33.454
No. Why would you think that?

25:33.455 --> 25:35.834
- Because you said.
- I didn't say.

25:35.835 --> 25:39.173
Alex, this is my thing!

25:39.174 --> 25:41.554
Mine.

25:41.555 --> 25:44.226
And you can't just
fucking insert yourself.

25:49.111 --> 25:51.992
This is when you leave.

26:48.397 --> 26:49.439
Wow.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.984
Don't get too excited;

26:50.985 --> 26:53.238
This is an intervention.

26:53.239 --> 26:55.242
Foreigner?

26:55.243 --> 26:57.539
Were you raised in a roller rink?

26:57.540 --> 26:59.501
- Guess what.
- What?

26:59.502 --> 27:01.129
You can use your regular voice.

27:01.130 --> 27:02.674
Clark can sleep through anything.

27:02.675 --> 27:04.720
Oh, I'm not doing this for Clark.

27:04.721 --> 27:06.139
I've been told
I sound like Harrison Ford

27:06.140 --> 27:08.102
when I speak in hushed tones.

27:09.439 --> 27:11.024
I'm sorry.

27:11.025 --> 27:14.740
That's... that's not even remotely true.

27:14.741 --> 27:16.075
How dare you?

27:16.076 --> 27:17.370
Who told you that?

27:17.371 --> 27:19.081
Several people have told me.

27:19.082 --> 27:21.713
