Amen.

00:36.246 --> 00:38.790
Well?

00:41.042 --> 00:42.919
All right.

00:44.504 --> 00:48.675
So...you can go through with this.

00:48.842 --> 00:50.719
Yeah, I think so.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.637
<i>Okay-</i>

00:52.804 --> 00:54.097
Can you?

00:59.769 --> 01:00.937
Propst, if this thing goes south --

01:01.104 --> 01:03.523
It's not going to.

01:05.275 --> 01:07.193
All right.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.322
You grab the iron

01:11.489 --> 01:15.994
and lay with your back facing the door
so he can't see you, okay?

01:16.161 --> 01:16.870
<i>I'll</i> take the sheet

01:17.037 --> 01:19.122
and <i>I'll</i> climb up on the table
where he can't see me.

01:19.289 --> 01:22.417
And when you're ready,
<i>I'll</i> call him in,

01:22.584 --> 01:24.127
put the sheet over his head.

01:24.294 --> 01:26.046
That's when you take the iron...

01:30.675 --> 01:32.260
All right.

01:32.427 --> 01:37.182
Then we'll get his gun,
we'll cuff him,

01:37.348 --> 01:41.269
and if he gets up
or if anything goes wrong...

01:47.358 --> 01:48.943
What?

01:50.320 --> 01:52.322
It's him or us.

01:58.078 --> 02:00.538
Have you even shot a gun before?

02:00.705 --> 02:04.209
Yes. I've hunted.

02:04.375 --> 02:07.087
You've hunted?

02:07.253 --> 02:10.173
They are gonna kill us.

02:15.261 --> 02:16.846
Okay?

02:17.013 --> 02:19.265
Are you ready to go through with this?

02:21.476 --> 02:23.812
Yeah.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.481
Yeah, we have to, right?

05:32.542 --> 05:34.043
One of these days,
we're gonna win.

05:34.210 --> 05:36.462
Ah, well, maybe if you
sharpen up your defense.

05:57.233 --> 05:58.234
You all right?

06:02.322 --> 06:04.365
Oh.

07:02.215 --> 07:03.674
Beautiful.

07:03.883 --> 07:04.926
Beautiful.

07:05.927 --> 07:06.719
Beautiful.

07:06.886 --> 07:08.304
Beautiful.

07:08.471 --> 07:11.265
Katya is very beautiful.

07:11.474 --> 07:14.435
Katya is very beautiful.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.436
Very good.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.814
Handsome.

07:17.980 --> 07:18.940
Handsome.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.817
Handsome.

07:20.983 --> 07:21.818
Handsome.

07:21.984 --> 07:26.364
Propst is not handsome.

07:26.572 --> 07:30.701
Propst is not handsome.

07:30.868 --> 07:31.994
<i>Spasibo.</i>

07:32.161 --> 07:33.371
Ugly.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.569
It was a long day today.
Did it feel long to you?

08:04.735 --> 08:06.571
Felt amazing to me.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.157
- That's what I meant.
- You know what I mean?

08:09.323 --> 08:11.451
At the end of the day,
you're completely drained.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.704
You spend all your energy doing
some sort of good in the world.

08:14.871 --> 08:16.164
Feels good.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.874
Was that today?

08:18.040 --> 08:19.459
Best feeling in the world.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.918
Yeah, it is.

08:22.962 --> 08:24.964
Are we gonna do this or what?

08:25.131 --> 08:26.924
I thought you'd never ask.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.885
All right.

08:29.051 --> 08:33.306
A year ago today,
I left my family, my friends,

08:33.472 --> 08:36.726
a full-ride scholarship,
all my Beatles albums,

08:36.893 --> 08:38.477
and countless female admirers...

08:39.645 --> 08:40.897
to come to Russia,

08:41.063 --> 08:43.357
a place that is cold, miserable,

08:43.524 --> 08:46.986
and where I couldn't speak
the language to save my life.

08:47.153 --> 08:49.155
Now I've been here a year.

08:49.322 --> 08:50.823
I've served in four different cities.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.450
I've had six different companions.

08:52.617 --> 08:56.287
I've been spit at.
I've been yelled at, cursed at.

08:56.454 --> 09:00.500
I've been hit by three cars
and countless vodka bottles.

09:00.666 --> 09:04.086
And somehow I still can't speak
this language to save my life.

09:04.253 --> 09:06.214
You're not that bad,
I'm telling you.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.133
Somehow, I've come to love
this crazy place

09:09.300 --> 09:11.219
and love these people.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.887
I'm glad to be here with you, Tuttle.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.764
With that,

09:14.931 --> 09:16.807
I take one shirt and burn it

09:16.974 --> 09:20.019
to signify one year gone
and one year left.

09:21.604 --> 09:25.024
And may your success continue
through the coming year.

09:26.817 --> 09:27.777
Cheers.

09:33.533 --> 09:35.201
Where did you buy this?

09:35.368 --> 09:37.662
I didn't buy it.
I found it, in the cupboard.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.997
I think it's fermented.

09:48.673 --> 09:50.841
I doubt he's even gonna be there.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.928
Well, I've never had anybody
come up to me and just ask me --

09:54.095 --> 09:55.304
ask me to teach him like that.

09:55.471 --> 09:56.889
Yeah. Yeah, right.

09:57.056 --> 09:58.599
That was odd.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.185
I don't think it was odd.
It's...it's awesome.

10:01.352 --> 10:05.231
There's missions that the guys
teach more in a week

10:05.398 --> 10:06.899
than we do an entire month.

10:07.066 --> 10:09.235
Yeah, I don't know.
It's just --

10:09.402 --> 10:12.738
The only thing is, I got
a little bit of a weird vibe from him.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.241
Oh, I didn't.
I think he seemed interested.

10:15.408 --> 10:18.744
He seemed genuinely interested
in what we had to teach him.

10:18.911 --> 10:21.956
It's not every day somebody
comes and seeks you out.

10:22.123 --> 10:23.666
I mean, how long
was he waiting at the door?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.084
Take it if we can get it, right?

10:25.251 --> 10:26.586
- It's a discussion.
- Yeah.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.129
Do you have a Book of Mormon
with you?

10:28.296 --> 10:30.756
No. I thought you packed one.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.050
I gave my last one away
and forgot to grab another one.

10:33.217 --> 10:36.053
Oh, seriously?
Well, let's just come back.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.638
There's no point in teaching
without a book.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.181
He's waiting for us.

10:39.348 --> 10:42.602
If we don't teach him now,
we may lose our opportunity.

10:42.768 --> 10:43.436
Oh.

10:55.448 --> 10:57.617
Oh.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.621
No, I think we go now,
and we teach him,

11:01.787 --> 11:03.205
and we can tell him about it

11:03.372 --> 11:04.915
and then bring him
another one tomorrow.

11:05.082 --> 11:07.251
That'll be an opportunity
to set up another appointment.

11:07.418 --> 11:10.755
Okay. I just think we should be
a little more prepared.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.180
<i>Privet.</i>

11:20.431 --> 11:22.725
This is gonna be great.

11:22.892 --> 11:24.518
"I'd like to share a message with you

11:24.685 --> 11:26.812
about a book
that will change your life.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.981
We didn't bring one with us,
but we promise it's awesome."

11:29.148 --> 11:31.233
We'll just stick to God and prophets.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.526
Okay. Yeah, that works.

11:32.693 --> 11:33.903
"God speaks to prophets,

11:34.070 --> 11:35.780
writes those words down
in sacred books

11:35.946 --> 11:37.073
like the Bible
and the Book of Mormon.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.492
No, no, we didn't bring one."

11:39.659 --> 11:42.453
I know.
We're less effective.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.373
That's broken.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.041
You coming?

11:48.793 --> 11:50.753
Geez.

11:55.341 --> 11:58.594
I'm just saying we should
come back later when we're prepared.

11:58.761 --> 11:59.762
This is ridiculous.

11:59.929 --> 12:01.514
You're being dramatic.

12:01.681 --> 12:04.058
Fine. Whatever you say.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.981
- Say it?
- Sure.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.484
Dear God, our Heavenly Father,

12:13.651 --> 12:16.737
we're grateful for the opportunity
we have to teach today.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.823
Please bless and send the Spirit
with us as we do

12:18.989 --> 12:22.118
and please protect us
from any harm or accident.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.452
We say these things in Jesus' name.

12:23.619 --> 12:24.787
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:27.832 --> 12:29.583
It's loud.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.210
It sounds like a quality program.

12:31.377 --> 12:32.753
Hate to interrupt.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.895
<i>Spasibo.</i>

13:22.845 --> 13:24.638
Shut up and don't move!

13:36.776 --> 13:38.819
Please, God, help us.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.989
This...This can't be happening.
I can't be here.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.365
Shh, Shh!

13:48.496 --> 13:51.582
The neighbors didn't
even hear us scream, okay?

13:51.749 --> 13:54.960
Nobody is going to help us.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.629
We have to do something ourselves.

13:56.796 --> 13:57.963
Shh!

14:12.394 --> 14:13.896
What?

14:14.063 --> 14:15.523
We're trapped in here.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.945
Can you get UP?

14:23.405 --> 14:28.077
We have to jump out of this window
or we are gonna die right here, okay?

14:28.244 --> 14:29.370
Wait, wait, wait.

14:29.537 --> 14:30.704
If they see us --

14:30.871 --> 14:33.123
If they see us, they'll kill us.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.835
Either way we're dead, okay?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.253
Wait.

14:46.679 --> 14:48.013
Wait.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.975
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, okay?

14:51.141 --> 14:52.935
- Please --
- Shh!

15:52.244 --> 15:53.996
Tuttle!

16:18.562 --> 16:21.273
Where are you going, my friend?
Hmm?

16:30.950 --> 16:31.909
Play drunk.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.310
Help us!

16:58.477 --> 17:00.729
Tuttle, shut up!

17:00.896 --> 17:01.981
Help!

17:02.147 --> 17:04.148
Somebody!

17:04.316 --> 17:05.818
They're gonna kill us, I know it.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.944
- They're gonna shoot us.
- Listen to me.

17:08.112 --> 17:10.239
Listen to me
and shut your mouth, okay?

17:10.406 --> 17:13.282
You need to shut your mouth,
and we'll be okay.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.537
Do you hear me?
We're gonna be okay.

17:16.704 --> 17:18.539
Shh.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.332
How do you know that?

18:28.442 --> 18:30.152
Okay, okay, okay-

18:40.245 --> 18:41.288
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.919
No, no, no, no!
Don't shoot me! Wait!

18:47.086 --> 18:48.712
No!

Yes. I'm listening.

My Son!

20:32.441 --> 20:34.401
They've got my son!

21:01.261 --> 21:02.304
That was just right before he left.

21:02.471 --> 21:03.931
This was him at the airport.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.850
This is the most recent one
that we got.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.268
When's the last time
you talked to him?

21:08.435 --> 21:10.270
We can only talk to him
at Christmas and on Mother's Day.

21:12.356 --> 21:14.441
How do we get it to them?

21:14.608 --> 21:16.360
United States government policy
is to not pay ransoms.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.320
So, what options do we have?

21:18.487 --> 21:20.739
- We can negotiate or rescue.
- Rescue?

21:20.906 --> 21:24.243
We put two agents on a plane
this morning.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.745
When they get to Russia,
they'll meet with the authorities.

21:26.912 --> 21:27.996
I should be there.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.706
We can't actually have you
leave the home.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.500
It's not safe.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.126
We don't know what harm
they could do to you and your family.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.211
Who are these people?

21:34.378 --> 21:39.049
The probability of your son
coming home alive or unharmed

21:39.216 --> 21:41.051
is very low in a case like this.

21:41.218 --> 21:45.013
Don't you dare say that to me!
Don't you dare take away my hope!

21:45.180 --> 21:47.975
This morning, when the phone rang,
I knew it had to be about Travis.

21:48.141 --> 21:52.646
The voice said,
"Brother Tuttle, this is Elder Tingey

21:52.813 --> 21:55.023
calling from Salt Lake."

21:56.817 --> 21:58.819
Then it hit me.

21:58.986 --> 22:02.531
They were gonna tell me
that he'd been..

22:02.698 --> 22:03.824
He'd been killed.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.332
I don't want that call.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.458
Nobody is going to help us.

22:13.625 --> 22:14.918
We have to do something ourselves.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.879
And we'll be okay.
Do you hear me?

22:18.046 --> 22:19.589
We're gonna be okay.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.675
How do you know that?

22:23.051 --> 22:26.263
Most people believe
in a supreme being.

22:26.430 --> 22:30.017
Even though they may call Him
by different names...

22:31.476 --> 22:33.687
we know that God lives.

22:36.857 --> 22:40.861
We are all children
of our Father in Heaven.

22:41.028 --> 22:43.697
We are created in His image.

22:43.864 --> 22:48.744
Because he is the Father of all people,
we are brothers and sisters.

22:50.662 --> 22:53.290
And he provided a way for us
to overcome...

22:54.916 --> 22:55.917
sin and death...

23:00.005 --> 23:02.716
so that we can return to His presence.

23:02.883 --> 23:05.761
He prepared a plan
that will bring us joy...

23:07.137 --> 23:10.390
and the central figure
in that plan is Jesus Christ.

23:10.557 --> 23:14.061
You plan on teaching someone today?

23:17.064 --> 23:19.900
I plan on teaching someone every day.

23:20.067 --> 23:24.112
I hate to break it to you,
but our teaching days are over.

23:27.908 --> 23:31.995
God speaks to His children
by way of prophets and apostles.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.956
They write His words down
in sacred books like the Bible

23:35.123 --> 23:36.792
called scriptures.

24:15.414 --> 24:16.706
What do you want?

24:16.873 --> 24:18.792
Whatever you want, we'll get you --

24:18.959 --> 24:22.421
money, enough food, passports --
anything.

24:22.587 --> 24:26.091
Just...Just tell us.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.483
$3,000.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.487
Are you serious?

24:47.654 --> 24:50.323
Hey, hey, w-we can get you that.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.575
If you let us go,

24:51.741 --> 24:55.370
you take us back to the apartment,
we could get you that today.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.123
$300,000.

24:58.290 --> 24:59.207
We don't have that at the apartment.

24:59.374 --> 25:02.002
Sergei says your church has money.

25:02.169 --> 25:03.253
They're not gonna pay the ransom.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.505
- Why?
- It doesn't work like that.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.048
If they don't pay,

25:07.215 --> 25:09.301
Sergei says the Mormons
will be exterminated.

25:09.468 --> 25:11.720
Mormons exterminated?

25:11.887 --> 25:13.180
Yes.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.557
- How long do we have?
- What do you mean?

25:15.724 --> 25:17.726
How long will Sergei wait
until we get his money?

25:17.893 --> 25:18.810
Propst!

25:18.977 --> 25:22.856
I don't know,
but Sergei is not a patient man.

25:29.613 --> 25:34.409
It is probably not the best idea
to antagonize the guys with the guns.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.039
- I think he's our way out of here.
- No!

25:39.206 --> 25:42.876
No, our way out of here is doing
exactly what they ask us to do,

25:43.043 --> 25:44.878
not smarting off to him.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.422
I was just talking to him.
Okay?

25:47.589 --> 25:50.592
I'm trying to soften him up.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.053
Propst, does he look
like he's gonna soften up?

25:53.220 --> 25:56.556
He's got a gun!
He's not gonna soften up!

25:56.723 --> 25:59.893
I don't know
if you remember last night

26:00.060 --> 26:01.770
when they bashed our heads in!

26:01.937 --> 26:02.979
You're exactly right.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.731
We're probably both
gonna die right here

26:04.898 --> 26:06.566
and get buried in the snow.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.361
I'm not trying to fool you or anybody.

26:09.528 --> 26:11.738
We have about
a one in a million chance

26:11.905 --> 26:13.740
of surviving here.

26:13.907 --> 26:17.452
And if this is my last day to be alive,
I'm gonna be myself.

26:17.619 --> 26:21.831
Let's try to cooperate with them,

26:21.998 --> 26:24.334
because if you're right, if...

26:25.544 --> 26:28.713
if we've only got a small chance,

26:28.880 --> 26:31.258
I want to be alive to take that chance,

26:31.424 --> 26:33.301
even if it is one in a million.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.804
Nobody's gonna pay for us.

26:35.971 --> 26:38.348
That's not how this works.

26:38.515 --> 26:42.978
We're alone,
and nobody knows where we are.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.398
I don't know what I'm doing here.

26:46.565 --> 26:49.276
The only thing I know
is to go by my instincts.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.570
Our mission is over.

26:51.736 --> 26:54.614
It ended the second
we knocked on their door.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.701
Now it's about survival.

26:57.867 --> 27:00.078
And you've got to trust me

27:00.245 --> 27:04.583
that I'm doing my best
so that we can survive.

27:05.959 --> 27:08.628
Just don't do anything stupid, okay?

27:14.843 --> 27:16.469
Nikolai.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.346
What are you doing?!

27:18.513 --> 27:20.557
Nikolai.

27:20.724 --> 27:21.891
Look...

27:23.018 --> 27:26.438
I need to go to the bathroom,
like bad.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.609
Nikolai, please.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.944
There's a bathroom
right in there, isn't there?

27:33.111 --> 27:34.404
Please let me go.

27:34.571 --> 27:36.573
I tell you how this works.

27:36.740 --> 27:39.159
I unlock you.

27:39.326 --> 27:41.328
You go to bathroom.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.121
Anything happens,

27:43.288 --> 27:45.123
I shoot your friend.

27:45.290 --> 27:49.919
He talks to me or you,
I shoot you, then him.

27:56.343 --> 27:57.302
Propst...

27:57.469 --> 27:58.720
Shh!

28:18.573 --> 28:19.991
Are you scared?

28:35.048 --> 28:36.716
You are scared.

28:38.009 --> 28:39.803
Want a beer?

28:41.680 --> 28:43.098
I do.

28:44.182 --> 28:45.892
I really do.

28:55.193 --> 28:56.361
You too?

28:57.862 --> 28:58.822
No.

28:58.988 --> 29:01.241
- What did I miss?
- Nothing.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.451
Nikolai just said he wants a drink.

29:03.618 --> 29:06.663
Me too. Can...Can we have some?
Can we have some?

29:06.830 --> 29:08.540
You want a beer?

29:08.707 --> 29:10.500
You don't know much about us,
do you?

29:10.667 --> 29:12.043
What do you want -- coffee, tea?

29:12.210 --> 29:13.628
Oh, boy.

29:13.795 --> 29:17.173
Uh...do you have juice or water?

29:17.340 --> 29:18.717
- No water.
- No?

29:18.883 --> 29:20.510
- We have juice.
- Juice.

29:20.677 --> 29:23.680
Please.
Juice would be amazing.

29:25.974 --> 29:27.308
<i>Okay-</i>

29:38.361 --> 29:39.904
What?

29:40.071 --> 29:42.741
Don't look at me like that.
You want a thank you?

29:42.907 --> 29:45.201
Yeah.

29:45.368 --> 29:47.078
He pointed his gun right at me.

29:48.288 --> 29:52.000
I'm telling you,
he's our way out of here.

29:59.382 --> 30:00.717
Lee Propst.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.136
Mr. Propst, this is Senator Gordon
Smith calling from Washington, D.C.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.596
Senator Smith?

30:04.763 --> 30:06.347
Listen, I've been briefed
on your son's situation.

30:06.514 --> 30:07.974
Although I have no more information,
I want you to know

30:08.141 --> 30:09.768
as your senator
and as your brother in Christ,

30:09.934 --> 30:12.437
we are doing all that we can
to ensure a proper return.

30:12.604 --> 30:14.981
So, are you working with the FBI?

30:15.148 --> 30:16.357
No, not yet.

30:16.524 --> 30:19.402
Are you working with
the State Department or the embassy?

30:19.569 --> 30:24.115
<i>Well, we -- we plan to,
uh, but we haven't yet.</i>

30:24.282 --> 30:25.909
Then what are you doing, Senator?

30:26.075 --> 30:28.661
Um...we -- We're gonna do --

30:28.828 --> 30:31.456
We're gonna do all that we can.

30:31.623 --> 30:34.459
I'm...I'm sorry. Uh...

30:34.626 --> 30:38.838
We're just very frustrated here.
We feel pretty helpless.

30:39.005 --> 30:43.259
I can't imagine what you
must be going through right now...

30:44.761 --> 30:46.012
but I believe that the rest of us,

30:46.179 --> 30:51.017
we should do all that we can
to lift each other's burdens.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.562
I know that doesn't sound
like a lot right now,

30:54.729 --> 30:57.982
but I hope you can feel our support.

30:59.526 --> 31:01.069
Well, I appreciate your call, Senator.

31:01.236 --> 31:04.322
Your...Your faith means a lot to me.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.493
You and your family will be
in my thoughts and prayers.

31:09.536 --> 31:11.955
Thank you.

31:31.975 --> 31:35.770
I wonder what it will be like
to tell our families about all this.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.314
I wonder if they'll even believe us.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.778
You think they know already?

31:43.945 --> 31:45.530
I hope not.

31:45.697 --> 31:48.575
My mom would be a hysterical wreck,

31:48.741 --> 31:50.702
my dad wouldn't be able to sleep,

31:50.869 --> 31:53.329
and my sisters -- forget about it.

31:53.496 --> 31:56.416
They'd be the ones
who went straight to the media.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.668
My sister's going to prom this week.

32:03.172 --> 32:04.883
I think you're right.

32:05.049 --> 32:06.175
What do you mean?

32:09.846 --> 32:11.806
Nobody's gonna pay for us.

32:13.892 --> 32:15.351
That makes sense.

32:15.518 --> 32:19.147
If the church paid for one hostage...

32:20.565 --> 32:24.903
paid a ransom to any one group,
then everybody in the church --

32:25.069 --> 32:27.405
missionaries and members --
they'd...

32:28.489 --> 32:31.701
they'd all be targets. So...

32:33.536 --> 32:35.163
So they can't pay a ransom.

32:35.330 --> 32:38.791
Otherwise, all the crazies in the world
would be lining up for a fast payday.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.836
- This is my fault.
- No.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.296
- Don't say that.
- No, it is.

32:43.463 --> 32:44.714
- No.
- If I had listened to you...

32:44.881 --> 32:48.176
...we would never have gone
to Nikolai's apartment.

32:49.928 --> 32:53.348
We wouldn't be here.
We wouldn't have been kidnapped.

32:53.514 --> 32:56.434
We wouldn't be sitting down here
in this disgusting apartment

32:56.601 --> 33:00.438
on this freezing floor,
just waiting to...

33:03.149 --> 33:05.234
-...waiting to die.
- That's not true.

33:05.401 --> 33:07.570
If it wouldn't have been that day,
it would have been another day.

33:07.737 --> 33:10.865
They had it all set up --
the dummy apartment, everything.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.992
If it wasn't us, it would have been
two other missionaries.

33:13.159 --> 33:16.329
No, that's not true.
I...l felt it.

33:18.790 --> 33:22.835
I felt it. It was small, it was quiet,
but it was there.

33:23.002 --> 33:26.798
It was a little voice saying,
"Don't go into that apartment."

33:26.965 --> 33:28.800
But I didn't listen.
I never...

33:31.260 --> 33:33.805
I never listen.
I did exactly what I wanted to do.

33:33.972 --> 33:36.140
I got it in my head that we were gonna
teach one more lesson.

33:36.307 --> 33:39.018
- One more lesson.
- Tuttle, it's not your fault...

33:39.185 --> 33:40.353
...and this is not over yet.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.271
We are still alive,
and we can get through this.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.232
- We've seen their faces.
- Okay.

33:44.399 --> 33:45.900
We've been gone for two days.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.362
Pretty soon,
the press is gonna break the story.

33:49.529 --> 33:51.322
They're gonna realize
that they're not gonna get a ransom

33:51.489 --> 33:52.323
and the Feds are on to them,

33:52.490 --> 33:53.533
and they're gonna have to cover
their tracks,

33:53.700 --> 33:54.450
and they're gonna start with us.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.411
We are -- We're dead.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.037
This is it. We're dead.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.122
Nikolai!

33:59.288 --> 33:59.998
What are you doing?

34:00.164 --> 34:01.457
Nikolai, come in here.

34:03.126 --> 34:06.004
What do we have to do to be let free?

34:06.170 --> 34:08.797
Tell us what we have to do,
and we will do it.

34:11.050 --> 34:15.346
Don't just laugh at us, okay?
Just tell us what we need to do.

34:15.513 --> 34:17.764
You're not in charge.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.143
- Are you?!
- Propst, calm down, man.

34:22.395 --> 34:23.980
Nikolai, wait.

34:24.147 --> 34:25.188
Nikolai.

34:25.356 --> 34:28.150
At least could you bring us
some chairs or something?!

34:29.944 --> 34:33.406
Chairs? You want chairs?

34:33.572 --> 34:36.409
Yes, or something.

34:44.417 --> 34:45.835
Thank you.

34:47.503 --> 34:49.297
I asked for chairs.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.132
Do you think we could figure out a way
to make ourselves

34:52.300 --> 34:56.137
a little bit more uncomfortable
while we're here?

35:02.143 --> 35:04.979
Best historical "Dream Team."
Go.

35:06.022 --> 35:07.523
No.

35:07.690 --> 35:08.983
Come on.

35:09.150 --> 35:12.570
Anyone, NBA, starting with guard.

35:12.737 --> 35:14.280
Who is it?

35:14.447 --> 35:17.366
Magic, Isiah, The Glove? Who?

35:17.533 --> 35:21.746
No. It's John Stockton,
no question, end of story.

35:21.913 --> 35:22.955
Here we go.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.583
You can't be serious!
Rodman over Malone.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.211
Malone just led the Jazz
to the finals last year,

35:28.377 --> 35:29.796
and he'll do it again this year, I bet.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.047
You know, there's no church policy

35:31.214 --> 35:33.341
that says you have to love
the Utah Jazz.

35:33.508 --> 35:34.842
At least I have a team!

35:35.009 --> 35:37.011
You don't just cheer for the --
whoever's winning.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.387
I'm just saying Rodman?

35:38.554 --> 35:40.973
He doesn't need luck.
He's got crazy.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.059
No, he's got Pippen and Jordan
to ride on.

35:43.226 --> 35:44.268
And Stockton has Malone.

35:44.435 --> 35:47.146
If you're telling me that you would take
Rodman over The Mailman,

35:47.313 --> 35:49.273
that freak over Malone,

35:49.440 --> 35:53.152
you and every bandwagon Bulls fan
are delusional if you really think that.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.153
You can't say you think that.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.447
Delusional is the word
that describes a Jazz fan

35:56.614 --> 35:59.742
who thinks they can win a title
while Jordan is still in the league.

35:59.909 --> 36:02.286
We've gotten to title games.
We...We could do it again.

36:02.453 --> 36:04.872
Yeah, and you choked,
and you will choke again.

36:05.039 --> 36:07.166
Michael Jordan is basketball king.

36:11.671 --> 36:13.631
See?

36:13.798 --> 36:15.591
Nikolai knows what he's talking about.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.763
Hey, Nikolai, wait.

36:22.348 --> 36:25.017
These stools are great, but...

36:25.977 --> 36:28.104
Tuttle's got a bad back.

36:28.271 --> 36:32.441
Is there any way you could cuff us
over by the mattress?

36:33.860 --> 36:38.447
I'm super comfortable here,
but, you know, so his back won't hurt.

36:40.783 --> 36:43.494
I've got a really bad back, so...

36:45.288 --> 36:47.373
Huh?

36:47.540 --> 36:49.167
Huh?

36:49.333 --> 36:51.377
Yeah. Good job.

36:51.544 --> 36:53.963
It's a bit disgusting,
but it's comfortable.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.214
Well-played.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.967
Hey, you know what I always say --
if you're gonna get shot,

36:58.134 --> 37:00.386
it might as well be
on a dirty, Russian mattress.

37:01.929 --> 37:03.431
- I don't know.
- Have you said that before?

37:03.598 --> 37:04.765
No, I don't.

37:10.104 --> 37:11.939
So, you never told me.

37:12.106 --> 37:14.192
Did you always want
to serve a mission?

37:15.568 --> 37:18.446
Actually, yeah.

37:18.613 --> 37:21.991
I don't know why. I just --
I always knew I would go.

37:23.075 --> 37:23.534
I was that kid

37:23.701 --> 37:26.037
who as soon as he was big enough
to push a lawnmower

37:26.204 --> 37:29.207
was out in the neighborhood,
making money.

37:29.373 --> 37:35.504
It's like a freaky mix between
Dale Carnegie and Donald Trump.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.089
If you could make money,
I would do it --

37:37.256 --> 37:41.135
anything from delivering paper,
shoveling snow.

37:41.302 --> 37:44.639
I did bake sales, babysitting,

37:44.805 --> 37:48.517
whatever it took to fill up
the mission account, you know?

37:49.518 --> 37:50.811
That's pretty impressive.

37:50.978 --> 37:54.398
I think I spent everything I ever made
on baseball cards and arcade games.

37:54.565 --> 37:55.775
I'm serious.

37:57.276 --> 38:00.279
I don't know. I just --
I guess I felt so lucky, you know,

38:00.446 --> 38:07.662
with my amazing family, friends,
the home I grew up in,

38:07.828 --> 38:11.999
you know, my good looks,
excellent physique...

38:12.166 --> 38:14.710
Not to mention
your charm and humility.

38:14.877 --> 38:16.879
Don't want to forget that.

38:17.046 --> 38:19.257
No, but, seriously, I don't know.

38:21.050 --> 38:24.595
Coming out here
and serving for two years...

38:26.764 --> 38:29.433
it just made sense.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.728
It seemed like the only way

38:32.895 --> 38:36.357
I could even begin to thank
my Heavenly Father

38:36.524 --> 38:39.694
for, you know,
everything He's given me.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.073
How about you?

38:47.910 --> 38:50.204
No, I never really wanted to go.

38:53.124 --> 38:54.542
Really?

38:55.626 --> 39:00.256
I think it was in high school
I decided for sure that I wasn't going.

39:02.633 --> 39:05.469
I remember I told my dad, and...

39:07.471 --> 39:08.973
I thought he was gonna be
really disappointed,

39:09.140 --> 39:11.225
but he just sat there...

39:14.979 --> 39:16.772
told me it was my decision.

39:19.150 --> 39:20.651
I really respected him for that.

39:23.738 --> 39:25.740
I was his only son, and...

39:27.658 --> 39:29.994
I'm sure he really wanted me to go.

39:31.454 --> 39:34.123
And what changed --
changed your mind?

39:40.921 --> 39:43.424
I was in this mission-prep class.

39:45.885 --> 39:48.763
I don't even know
why I was there, but...

39:51.390 --> 39:55.561
there was this instructor, Jim.

39:55.728 --> 39:57.980
Jim Goodwin.
Brother Goodwin.

39:58.147 --> 40:00.816
He would drag me
into this class every time.

40:03.486 --> 40:06.739
We were reading the Book of Luke,

40:06.906 --> 40:09.075
where Christ was suffering
in the garden.

40:14.372 --> 40:18.417
And here you had this...
this perfect person,

40:18.584 --> 40:21.587
the one perfect person
who ever lived...

40:24.632 --> 40:27.426
about to suffer for all the pain...

40:29.512 --> 40:34.058
and heartache and sins
of the entire world.

40:38.938 --> 40:41.023
And then He asked His Father...

40:45.194 --> 40:47.530
if there was some way for Him...

40:50.825 --> 40:53.661
not to have to go through with it.

40:53.828 --> 40:57.748
But then He said,
"Not My will, but Thine be done."

40:59.959 --> 41:02.878
I realized that He didn't want to do it.

41:03.045 --> 41:05.631
He didn't want to be whipped...

41:08.175 --> 41:10.386
or crucified.

41:13.931 --> 41:15.933
But He loved his Father.

41:19.562 --> 41:22.106
And He loved all of us enough...

41:22.273 --> 41:25.192
that He did it anyway.

41:28.279 --> 41:33.325
And I thought, if Christ could make
that sacrifice for His Father...

41:39.248 --> 41:42.543
then the least I could do
is serve a mission for mine.

41:47.298 --> 41:50.176
When I told my dad, he...

41:51.385 --> 41:53.053
he was really happy.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.436
And even though initially
I did it for him,

42:00.603 --> 42:03.063
in the end, it made me happy, too.

42:15.159 --> 42:18.204
I don't think I've ever told anybody
all of that.

42:24.168 --> 42:26.420
- Tuttle?
- Hmm?

42:27.922 --> 42:29.632
I'm glad...

42:29.798 --> 42:31.509
I'm glad you came out.

42:34.094 --> 42:36.347
Yeah. Me too.

42:37.598 --> 42:39.808
It's kind of nice to not be
the one crying, you know,

42:39.975 --> 42:41.310
for the first time.

42:47.733 --> 42:49.527
Hope Nikolai doesn't see me.

42:50.945 --> 42:53.572
Seriously, pull yourself together, man.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.199
You're a mess.

43:54.174 --> 43:55.342
Look at me.

44:00.180 --> 44:01.974
Look at me.

44:05.894 --> 44:07.479
They didn't pay today.

44:09.231 --> 44:11.317
I'm losing my patience.

44:32.921 --> 44:36.008
Hey, are you okay?

44:39.845 --> 44:42.264
Where was all your charm
right there?

45:11.627 --> 45:12.920
Nikolai.

47:36.897 --> 47:39.024
- Nikolai.
- Da?

47:43.904 --> 47:45.155
Get the gun!

47:46.031 --> 47:48.617
- Get the gun!
- I can't -- I can't reach it!

47:49.910 --> 47:51.578
I can't reach it!

48:06.718 --> 48:07.386
<i>Privet.</i>

48:09.888 --> 48:12.391
Shh, Shh, Shh, Shh!

48:19.982 --> 48:21.441
It's okay.

48:21.608 --> 48:22.609
I'm sorry.

48:34.538 --> 48:37.916
Most people believe
in a supreme being.

48:41.128 --> 48:44.131
Even though they may call Him
by different names,

48:44.298 --> 48:45.924
we know that God lives.

48:46.091 --> 48:47.259
We are His children.

48:47.426 --> 48:50.345
He prepared a plan
that will bring us joy.

48:50.512 --> 48:52.764
Help me!

48:52.973 --> 48:53.974
Help me!

48:54.182 --> 48:56.768
Help me!

49:28.675 --> 49:29.843
Help me.

49:44.608 --> 49:46.193
Are they fighting again?

49:46.360 --> 49:49.446
No. She locked him
on the balcony.

49:49.613 --> 49:51.281
That's one way to deal with him.

49:51.448 --> 49:53.492
Vladdy...

50:10.342 --> 50:11.468
Hey, what are you doing?

50:11.635 --> 50:12.636
Don't feed his addiction.

50:12.803 --> 50:14.012
I'm just being a good neighbor.

50:14.179 --> 50:15.973
Vladdy...

50:21.436 --> 50:24.231
We may never teach this guy,
but we can be his friend.

50:24.398 --> 50:26.942
You are good American boys.

50:27.109 --> 50:29.945
My favorite Americans.

50:56.430 --> 50:58.974
Breakfast in bed.
You shouldn't have.

51:03.228 --> 51:05.147
Hey, Nikolai,

51:05.313 --> 51:08.900
thanks for backing me up
with the Bulls yesterday.

51:09.067 --> 51:10.360
When it comes to basketball,

51:10.527 --> 51:13.071
Tuttle doesn't know
how to pick a team.

51:13.238 --> 51:15.073
Your name is Tuttle?

51:16.033 --> 51:17.367
And what is yours?

51:17.534 --> 51:19.286
Propst.

51:21.913 --> 51:24.041
They're our last names.

51:24.207 --> 51:26.001
Why not use your first names?

51:26.168 --> 51:27.836
We're called elders.

51:29.171 --> 51:33.967
It's from the Bible.
It means ministers or priests.

51:35.302 --> 51:37.679
That other guy who's with you --
Sergei --

51:37.846 --> 51:40.515
he leave you here alone?

51:44.227 --> 51:47.814
How do you know him?
Are you two friends?

51:52.652 --> 51:56.448
What's that tattoo on his hand?

51:56.615 --> 51:58.950
Is that Russian Mafia or something?

52:02.370 --> 52:04.956
You don't know much
about Russian tattoos, do you?

52:05.123 --> 52:07.542
No. I guess not.

52:07.709 --> 52:09.753
- He was a hero.
- A hero to who?

52:09.920 --> 52:11.004
The Russian navy.

52:13.423 --> 52:16.009
But that was a long time ago.

52:24.142 --> 52:27.187
<i>Flowers, cards, yellow ribbons --</i>

52:27.354 --> 52:29.189
<i>well-wishers from across the country</i>

52:29.356 --> 52:32.025
<i>continue to show their support
for the kidnapped missionaries.</i>

52:32.192 --> 52:34.528
<i>A Baptist congregation in Alabama</i>

52:34.694 --> 52:36.488
<i>sent handwritten notes
by their own youth</i>

52:36.655 --> 52:40.325
<i>to comfort
the Propst and Tuttle families.</i>

52:40.492 --> 52:43.703
<i>A candlelit vigil held
by a youth group in Wisconsin</i>

52:43.870 --> 52:47.165
<i>was a token of support
for their fellow Christian believers.</i>

53:17.028 --> 53:19.364
- What is it?
- I don't know.

53:24.661 --> 53:26.037
Who is it from?

53:26.204 --> 53:27.455
I don't know.

53:27.622 --> 53:29.040
What do you mean you don't know?

53:29.207 --> 53:32.586
Well, it's a cashier's check.
It doesn't say.

53:32.752 --> 53:35.088
Someone just left it
on the front porch.

53:46.391 --> 53:50.145
Mary, this could save him.

53:54.733 --> 53:55.984
Lee...

53:59.446 --> 54:01.072
Lee, we can't.

54:09.372 --> 54:10.707
I know.

54:28.016 --> 54:29.226
- Did you hear that?
- Shh!

54:49.412 --> 54:51.581
Boy, you are worthless.

54:57.629 --> 55:02.342
I told them you're going to die
if they do not pay.

55:02.509 --> 55:04.970
And what happens?
They do not pay.

55:05.136 --> 55:07.305
I tell them you're going to die
if they go to the media.

55:07.472 --> 55:11.101
And what happens?
They go to the media.

55:14.271 --> 55:17.565
Maybe He has forgotten
about you,huh?

55:24.781 --> 55:27.242
You come
from a big American church,

55:27.409 --> 55:31.413
going around town telling people
He loves everybody.

55:33.248 --> 55:34.916
Does He love me?

55:36.376 --> 55:37.335
Hmm?

55:40.630 --> 55:42.590
Tell me what you tell everyone.

55:44.092 --> 55:45.051
Tell me.

56:03.486 --> 56:05.280
We know that God lives.

56:07.365 --> 56:08.575
We're His children...

56:10.660 --> 56:12.871
and we're created in His image...

56:15.999 --> 56:19.586
because He's the Father of all people.

56:20.754 --> 56:22.630
We're brothers.

56:23.715 --> 56:25.091
We're all brothers.

56:29.763 --> 56:32.140
He provided a way for us to...

56:32.307 --> 56:35.310
overcome sin and death...

56:37.103 --> 56:38.271
and return to His presence,

56:38.438 --> 56:42.942
and He prepared a plan
that will bring us joy.

56:45.028 --> 56:48.448
And the central figure
in that plan is Jesus Christ.

56:51.159 --> 56:55.747
So...you think He's real?

57:00.543 --> 57:03.004
I feel Him. Yes, I do.

57:21.231 --> 57:22.649
You feel that?

57:24.025 --> 57:25.527
Yes.

57:25.693 --> 57:27.445
How about this?

57:27.612 --> 57:29.197
Do you feel this?

57:30.698 --> 57:34.202
What about this?
You feel this? Huh?

57:34.369 --> 57:35.829
Is this real?

57:36.621 --> 57:38.206
Huh?

57:38.373 --> 57:39.707
Do you feel this?

57:42.127 --> 57:44.254
Huh? Do you feel this?

57:52.595 --> 57:56.391
This...This is the only thing
that's real.

58:14.117 --> 58:15.076
Here.

58:16.619 --> 58:18.329
Write down your last goodbyes

58:18.496 --> 58:23.501
and tell your parents
it's your last chance to be alive.

58:42.437 --> 58:44.230
Roy speaking.

58:44.397 --> 58:46.816
Is this the Tuttle family?

58:46.983 --> 58:47.942
Who is this?

58:48.109 --> 58:50.612
My name is Mark Larsen.
I'm calling from Denver.

58:50.778 --> 58:54.240
- And what station are you with?
- I'm not from any station.

58:54.407 --> 58:56.868
I, um...

58:57.035 --> 58:57.494
<i>I wanted to talk to you</i>

58:57.660 --> 58:59.996
<i>about what's going through
your son's mind right now.</i>

59:00.163 --> 59:02.123
How would you know
anything about that?

59:03.374 --> 59:05.919
Because I was kidnapped, too.

59:06.085 --> 59:11.257
<i>I was in Argentina at the time,
nearly 20 years ago.</i>

59:11.424 --> 59:16.804
We were kidnapped for ransom,
just like your son.

59:16.971 --> 59:20.934
Our first night, we were terrified,
couldn't sleep,

59:21.100 --> 59:23.061
thought we were going to die.

59:23.228 --> 59:26.940
In fact, the whole time,
we thought we were going to die.

59:29.192 --> 59:32.904
Your thoughts start to wander.

59:35.073 --> 59:39.077
You think about your family,

59:39.244 --> 59:42.288
the ones you are serving.

59:44.832 --> 59:47.752
You don't want to cause anyone
to worry.

59:49.212 --> 59:52.423
You think that this kidnapping,

59:52.590 --> 59:56.135
this situation is...

59:57.637 --> 01:00:00.974
somehow harder
on everyone else than...

01:00:02.517 --> 01:00:04.978
<i>it is on you,</i>

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:07.313
<i>so you start to pray.</i>

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:10.608
<i>You're not praying for yourself.</i>

01:00:10.775 --> 01:00:13.194
<i>You're praying for everyone else.</i>

01:00:17.198 --> 01:00:20.910
<i>And finally, you think about</i>

01:00:21.077 --> 01:00:23.454
<i>the ones who have taken you</i>

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:27.417
<i>and what they've done to you
and why.</i>

01:00:27.584 --> 01:00:32.714
<i>You begin to worry
about what will happen to them</i>

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.927
<i>for all of the things
that they're doing to you.</i>

01:00:42.432 --> 01:00:47.437
Then, almost against your will...

01:00:48.605 --> 01:00:50.189
you pray for them...

01:00:54.569 --> 01:01:00.158
and your heart fills with compassion,

01:01:00.325 --> 01:01:02.243
and you plead

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:06.372
that they will feel God's love and...

01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:10.418
that they'll change.

01:01:13.338 --> 01:01:18.885
<i>I imagine your son is having
some of those same thoughts.</i>

01:01:19.052 --> 01:01:20.595
What happened to you?

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:27.435
We put our faith in God.

01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:33.107
<i>No matter how bleak
the circumstance seems to be,</i>

01:01:33.274 --> 01:01:36.027
<i>no matter...</i>

01:01:36.194 --> 01:01:38.154
<i>how horrible,</i>

01:01:38.321 --> 01:01:41.783
<i>I want you to remember one thing --</i>

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:45.953
<i>the longer those valiant boys
spend with their kidnappers,</i>

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.248
the harder it will be
for them to keep them...

01:01:55.672 --> 01:02:00.301
because light
always overcomes darkness.

01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:53.146
We just got this.

01:02:53.312 --> 01:02:55.314
It's from your son.

01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:57.900
But I think it'd be best if you read it.

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:02.613
"Do not mess around with these guys.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.408
Give them exactly what they want.

01:03:05.575 --> 01:03:07.910
They have guns.

01:03:08.077 --> 01:03:09.579
We think they have poison.

01:03:09.746 --> 01:03:12.498
We think --

01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:15.543
Work quickly and work smartly.

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:19.630
If you'll not give them the money,
tell them so we can die."

01:03:51.788 --> 01:03:53.372
We could save him.

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:01.005
We could --

01:04:01.172 --> 01:04:02.924
We could save our son with this.

01:04:05.218 --> 01:04:07.929
We have the power to keep him
from being hurt

01:04:08.095 --> 01:04:10.306
and from suffering.

01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:14.519
I don't want him to die.

01:04:16.187 --> 01:04:18.314
I don't want to sacrifice our son.

01:04:24.529 --> 01:04:26.906
<i>More details of the kidnapped
missionaries today.</i>

01:04:27.073 --> 01:04:27.865
<i>Ransom photos</i>

01:04:28.032 --> 01:04:30.827
<i>of 20-year-old Travis Tuttle
of Gilbert, Arizona,</i>

01:04:30.993 --> 01:04:33.663
<i>and 20-year-old Andrew Propst
were released</i>

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:36.165
<i>with the complete text
of the ransom note.</i>

01:04:36.332 --> 01:04:37.708
<i>Specific demands were listed,</i>

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:41.963
<i>including directions
not to alert the FSB or media</i>

01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:45.132
<i>or the missionaries
would be "exterminated."</i>

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:48.177
<i>Earlier today, the Tuttle family
spoke with Eyewitness News</i>

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:49.595
<i>over the phone.</i>

01:04:49.762 --> 01:04:52.890
<i>Right now we really don't know
what is going to happen.</i>

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:55.017
<i>The church has given us updates
as they receive them,</i>

01:04:55.184 --> 01:04:58.813
<i>and we've received calls and visits
by some of the leaders.</i>

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:02.984
<i>What would you tell your son
if you could speak to him right now?</i>

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:07.238
<i>I would tell him
that we love him and miss him.</i>

01:05:07.405 --> 01:05:09.615
<i>I would tell him
that no matter what happens,</i>

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:11.826
<i>we are proud of him,</i>

01:05:11.993 --> 01:05:16.539
<i>and we know that the Lord knows
where he is and what he needs.</i>

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:04.045
Here we go.

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:09.342
Nikolai!

01:06:22.897 --> 01:06:24.148
Thank you.

01:06:44.627 --> 01:06:46.212
You want a beer?

01:06:48.923 --> 01:06:50.216
No.

01:06:52.259 --> 01:06:54.095
<i>I bet you do.</i>

01:06:58.766 --> 01:07:00.142
Yeah, I do.

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:15.741
Help you out.

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:29.046
<i>Spasibo.</i>

01:07:59.577 --> 01:08:00.619
Tuttle.

01:08:03.706 --> 01:08:06.876
Tuttle, we're free.

01:08:08.544 --> 01:08:10.254
We're getting out of here.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.216
- How did you get --
- Shh!

01:08:14.383 --> 01:08:15.801
This ends right now.

01:08:15.968 --> 01:08:17.136
Wait, wait, wait.

01:08:17.303 --> 01:08:19.721
There are still two guys out there
with guns.

01:08:19.889 --> 01:08:21.474
If we mess this up, we're dead.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.227
We've got to come up with a plan
that we both feel good about.

01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:27.020
Hey, the plan is simple.

01:08:27.188 --> 01:08:30.066
We knock them out,
we handcuff them,

01:08:30.232 --> 01:08:31.817
and we take their guns,
and we get out of here.

01:08:31.984 --> 01:08:34.028
No,no,no.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:36.029
It's got to be perfect.

01:08:36.197 --> 01:08:37.531
We get one shot at this.

01:08:37.698 --> 01:08:40.033
Okay. Here.

01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:42.368
Sit down, sit down.

01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:44.580
Let me show you.

01:08:44.747 --> 01:08:46.957
<i>I'll</i> stand here, all right?

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:49.502
And <i>I'll</i> take the sheet.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:52.171
When he comes in,
put it over his head.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:54.090
We got to knock him out.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.261
- This.
- Propst!

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:47.725
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:49.895
If they catch us, we are dead.

01:09:51.522 --> 01:09:55.192
Just take a second and remember
that you're not the only one involved.

01:09:57.403 --> 01:10:00.281
Now, we need to be absolutely certain
we're doing the right thing.

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:02.032
We got to know what we're doing.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.543
Bow your head.

01:10:20.176 --> 01:10:21.760
Our Father in Heaven...

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:28.184
we know we are in Thy care.

01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:34.356
And right now, we need that help
more than ever.

01:10:36.692 --> 01:10:39.069
Please guide us...

01:10:40.696 --> 01:10:42.781
direct us,

01:10:42.948 --> 01:10:44.658
keep us from harm...

01:10:46.994 --> 01:10:49.079
in the name of Jesus Christ.

01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.047
Amen.

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.845
Well?

01:11:07.598 --> 01:11:08.933
All right.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.772
So...you can go through with this?

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:18.150
Yeah, I think so.

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:19.401
<i>Okay-</i>

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:37.539
Ready when you are.

01:13:42.336 --> 01:13:44.671
Please help me.

01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:46.298
Please.

01:13:58.352 --> 01:13:59.978
Propst.

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:01.814
Propst, we've got to do this.

01:14:07.778 --> 01:14:09.238
You plan on teaching someone today?

01:14:09.405 --> 01:14:11.323
I plan on teaching someone every day.

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:13.283
We know that God lives.

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:16.286
We're His children,
and we're created in His image.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:19.748
He provided a way for us
to overcome sin and death.

01:14:19.915 --> 01:14:20.874
So, what changed your mind?

01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:23.419
It hit me that He didn't want
to go through it.

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:26.380
He didn't want to be whipped
and crucified.

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:30.217
But He loved his Father enough
that he did it anyway.

01:14:30.384 --> 01:14:32.678
He was a hero.

01:14:32.845 --> 01:14:34.763
He prepared a plan
that will bring us joy.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.976
You're not in charge.

01:14:39.143 --> 01:14:41.019
Come on.
We've got to do this.

01:14:46.024 --> 01:14:47.609
Propst, let's go.

01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:54.992
Propst.

01:15:26.398 --> 01:15:28.400
He prepared a plan for us.

01:17:16.258 --> 01:17:18.260
<i>Today, Senator Gordon Smith
of Oregon</i>

01:17:18.427 --> 01:17:19.303
<i>met with President Clinton</i>

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:21.847
<i>on behalf of the two missionaries
who have been kidnapped</i>

01:17:22.014 --> 01:17:25.517
<i>and are being held hostage
somewhere near Saratov, Russia.</i>

01:17:25.684 --> 01:17:26.810
<i>The President pledged full support</i>

01:17:26.977 --> 01:17:29.104
<i>of efforts
to bring the missionaries to safety,</i>

01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:31.440
<i>though no ransom will be paid.</i>

01:17:31.607 --> 01:17:34.067
<i>The President is very aware
of the hostage situation,</i>

01:17:34.234 --> 01:17:36.194
<i>and he's concerned
for the safety of the missionaries.</i>

01:17:36.361 --> 01:17:39.323
<i>After a brief phone call
with the families of the missionaries,</i>

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:40.866
<i>Senator Smith has taken great strides</i>

01:17:41.033 --> 01:17:45.370
<i>to pressure state and national leaders
to do all they can for the missionaries.</i>

01:17:45.537 --> 01:17:48.457
<i>Leaders of the Mormon church
are asking members of all religions</i>

01:17:48.624 --> 01:17:49.750
<i>to come together in unity</i>

01:17:49.916 --> 01:17:53.545
<i>to fast and pray on behalf
of those being held in Saratov.</i>

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:55.672
<i>The unique approach of uniting in faith</i>

01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:58.925
<i>has resulted in hundreds,
if not thousands, of small acts</i>

01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:01.094
<i>from citizens all across the country.</i>

01:18:01.261 --> 01:18:02.929
<i>It's by these actions, they say,</i>

01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:05.891
<i>that the hand of God
will be recognized.</i>

01:18:47.099 --> 01:18:48.225
<i>Privet.</i>

01:18:48.392 --> 01:18:48.892
Ah!

01:18:50.977 --> 01:18:51.645
Huh?

01:18:54.398 --> 01:18:55.857
Beds comfortable?

01:18:56.024 --> 01:18:57.984
Yeah. We're fine.

01:18:58.151 --> 01:18:59.736
How's the food?

01:18:59.903 --> 01:19:02.197
The portions could be bigger.

01:19:11.415 --> 01:19:13.208
Where are we going?

01:19:15.419 --> 01:19:18.380
Don't you worry.
I will take care of you.

01:19:19.798 --> 01:19:21.633
I will take care of everything.

01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:27.889
Were you in the navy?

01:19:28.056 --> 01:19:29.808
What do you care?

01:19:29.975 --> 01:19:32.144
Your tattoo.

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:34.354
It means Russian navy, doesn't it?

01:19:37.232 --> 01:19:41.361
Nikolai said you were
somewhat of a hero.

01:19:41.528 --> 01:19:44.322
Did you save someone's life?

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:51.872
Did you earn any medals?

01:19:53.165 --> 01:19:54.875
Nikolai talks too much.

01:19:56.168 --> 01:19:57.961
Here.

01:19:58.128 --> 01:19:59.296
Write your goodbyes.

01:20:11.183 --> 01:20:12.684
How do you feel?

01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:18.899
Honestly?

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:25.113
I feel calm.

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:29.034
So do I.

01:21:56.788 --> 01:21:58.999
Bulls won yesterday.

01:22:00.667 --> 01:22:05.255
Jordan only had 24 points,
but it doesn't matter.

01:22:05.422 --> 01:22:07.173
They win again.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.968
Are you celebrating the victory?

01:22:10.135 --> 01:22:11.678
Cheers.

01:22:11.845 --> 01:22:13.597
Well, congratulations to you both.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.479
Utah Jazz win, too.

01:22:21.646 --> 01:22:24.858
But Maloney only had 23 points.

01:22:25.025 --> 01:22:27.944
So Jordan's still better.

01:22:29.154 --> 01:22:31.698
I never said he wasn't.

01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:34.451
So, no money today?

01:22:34.618 --> 01:22:37.245
Sergei said no.

01:22:37.412 --> 01:22:39.789
If it does come,
do you get any of it?

01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:43.126
You should at least get half of it.

01:22:43.293 --> 01:22:45.420
I mean, you're doing all the work.
You deserve --

01:22:45.587 --> 01:22:46.546
No!

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:50.717
No. I don't want to be here.

01:22:50.884 --> 01:22:55.055
I've been working
at the mechanic shop for six months.

01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:58.266
Last week, my girlfriend comes to me
and tells me she's pregnant.

01:23:00.477 --> 01:23:02.729
I don't know what I'm to do.

01:23:02.896 --> 01:23:04.689
I can't afford a family.

01:23:07.609 --> 01:23:09.486
Sergei works there, too.

01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:12.322
Tells me,
"You want to make some money?"

01:23:12.489 --> 01:23:14.324
I tell him yes.

01:23:14.491 --> 01:23:17.619
He tells me to believe in God.

01:23:17.786 --> 01:23:22.415
He says, "invite Christian missionaries
to teach you."

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:26.169
Then he shows me a magazine...

01:23:27.545 --> 01:23:31.716
showing all the rich Christians
and tells me how to plan to take some.

01:23:36.096 --> 01:23:37.847
It was to be so simple.

01:23:39.307 --> 01:23:41.893
We take you, they pay us...

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:44.521
we release you.

01:23:47.774 --> 01:23:49.526
But they didn't pay.

01:23:50.944 --> 01:23:52.862
They didn't come for you.

01:23:55.782 --> 01:24:00.495
I want to be done, but Sergei says
he'll shoot me if I let you go.

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:07.919
I don't want the money.

01:24:10.505 --> 01:24:12.382
I just want to live.

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:20.974
Why did this happen to me?

01:24:22.809 --> 01:24:24.477
You teach of God?

01:24:26.438 --> 01:24:29.149
How did He let me end up here?

01:24:29.315 --> 01:24:30.650
Nikolai...

01:24:32.569 --> 01:24:35.238
God doesn't control...

01:24:35.405 --> 01:24:37.657
what we choose to do.

01:24:37.824 --> 01:24:39.325
It's up to you.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.555
That tattoo...

01:25:02.265 --> 01:25:04.225
on Sergei's hand...

01:25:07.312 --> 01:25:09.773
it was for a comrade he tried to save.
