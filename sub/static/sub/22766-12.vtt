WEBVTT

00:04.463 --> 00:06.564
Morning. Morning.

00:07.467 --> 00:08.477
Do you want me
to make you some coffee?

00:08.501 --> 00:12.503
No, I always get one
from the cart at work,

00:12.572 --> 00:13.437
Unless you're making
some for yourself.

00:13.506 --> 00:16.641
No, actually,
the cart sounds good,

00:16.709 --> 00:19.410
'cause I have no idea
how to use this thing.

00:21.648 --> 00:24.849
Um, so...

00:24.918 --> 00:25.961
You wanna go straight to work,

00:25.985 --> 00:27.129
Or do you need to stop by
at your ace first or...

00:27.153 --> 00:32.590
I think my fish will survive
till I get home tonight.

00:32.659 --> 00:33.702
Though I could go feed them now,

00:33.726 --> 00:38.496
If you wanted to get
a drink tonight after work.

00:38.565 --> 00:41.599
Yeah, sure...

00:41.668 --> 00:42.433
What?

00:42.502 --> 00:46.871
I actually have plans tonight.

00:46.940 --> 00:49.707
Plans? But I can cancel them.

00:49.776 --> 00:50.408
Nope.

00:50.477 --> 00:53.811
Keep your plans. It's fine.

00:58.084 --> 01:00.852
Smooth.

01:04.291 --> 01:05.322
Hey. Hey.

01:05.391 --> 01:09.661
How was the night shift?
Only got puked on twice.

01:09.729 --> 01:12.364
Then it was a good night.

01:12.432 --> 01:12.864
Bye, guys. See you tomorrow.

01:12.933 --> 01:13.998
Bye. Night.

01:14.067 --> 01:17.802
Have you contacted your
sister yet about meeting up?

01:17.871 --> 01:18.871
Still working on it.

01:21.174 --> 01:21.773
It might actually
be better for her.

01:21.842 --> 01:24.976
If I keep a little distance.

01:25.045 --> 01:25.911
Better for her or for you?

01:25.979 --> 01:30.348
You know what would
be good for me?

01:30.417 --> 01:33.652
Is dinner with you tonight.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.822
Are you gonna shower first?
Depends on who's paying.

01:36.890 --> 01:37.970
Then it's definitely on me.

01:41.061 --> 01:42.061
Later. Bye.

01:45.132 --> 01:47.733
And now she's shivering
and... and throwing up,

01:47.801 --> 01:50.035
And ii don't know what to do.

01:50.104 --> 01:51.104
Deb, what's going on?

01:51.171 --> 01:52.004
Her homeless friend
is nine months pregnant.

01:52.072 --> 01:55.207
And has a fever.
She needs to come in.

01:55.276 --> 01:56.174
But she won't, right? No.

01:56.243 --> 01:59.511
Would you come out
and help her, please?

01:59.580 --> 02:00.846
Not when she's this far along.

02:00.915 --> 02:05.517
She needs to be monitored and
have emergency measures nearby.

02:05.586 --> 02:08.053
Dr. Choi...

02:08.122 --> 02:10.889
Let me get some supplies.

02:10.958 --> 02:12.157
Hey, wait... hey...

02:12.226 --> 02:16.128
You're just gonna go treat
a pregnant girl on the streets?

02:16.197 --> 02:17.307
I have met some of these kids.

02:17.331 --> 02:18.575
They're underage.
They know that if they come in,

02:18.599 --> 02:23.035
They'll get put in a system.
Yeah, but she's nine months.

02:23.104 --> 02:23.936
She's gonna have to come in
eventually to have her baby.

02:24.005 --> 02:27.273
But she needs
to be assessed now.

02:28.309 --> 02:32.244
Nat, I could use your help.
Seriously?

02:37.452 --> 02:40.319
Fine. Thanks.

02:44.959 --> 02:47.893
Text babysitter.

02:47.962 --> 02:48.973
Cold pizza is
owen's favorite breakfast.

02:48.997 --> 02:52.431
There's some in the fridge.
Tell him I love him.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.501
Send. <i>- I'll send your message.</i>

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.416 --> 03:09.416
She's over here.

03:13.154 --> 03:14.087
Come on. Come on.

03:14.155 --> 03:16.422
I wrapped her up,
but she's still shivering.

03:19.094 --> 03:19.659
Hey.

03:19.728 --> 03:20.593
Laura, I'm dr. Manning.

03:20.662 --> 03:24.364
I'm gonna take
your temperature, okay?

03:24.432 --> 03:25.432
Let me take a look.

03:28.837 --> 03:29.636
103.

03:29.704 --> 03:30.503
You most likely have
an infection.

03:30.572 --> 03:33.540
It is very important
that we treat it.

03:33.608 --> 03:34.707
Before you go into labor.

03:34.776 --> 03:37.544
Okay, but my... my water broke,
what does that mean?

03:37.612 --> 03:41.281
When did your water break?
Two days ago.

03:51.293 --> 03:52.025
Dr. Reese...

03:52.094 --> 03:54.794
How was your dinner
with your dad?

03:54.863 --> 03:55.695
It was good.

03:55.764 --> 03:57.964
I mean, I'm glad
we're talking again.

03:58.033 --> 04:00.500
He's funny, smart.

04:00.569 --> 04:01.846
You don't sound
entirely convinced.

04:01.870 --> 04:05.138
Well, it's just kinda hard
to look past the last 20 years.

04:05.207 --> 04:08.208
I know he wrote me
those letters, but...

04:08.277 --> 04:11.478
There were other ways
to contact me if he wanted.

04:11.547 --> 04:14.314
Makes me wonder.

04:14.383 --> 04:15.248
Well, you know what,
I've always been.

04:15.317 --> 04:18.185
Immensely impressed
with your instincts,

04:18.253 --> 04:21.555
So... No reason to stop
listening to them now.

04:21.623 --> 04:24.291
Yeah, I guess so.

04:27.363 --> 04:30.264
Courtney? I've got luke wallis.

04:30.332 --> 04:32.766
Cystic fibrosis.
No breath sounds on the right.

04:32.835 --> 04:35.435
Tachycardic with bp 122 over 66.

04:35.504 --> 04:36.336
Satting at 86. I know luke.

04:36.405 --> 04:39.606
How you doing, buddy?
Been better.

04:39.675 --> 04:40.507
He was just watching tv,

04:40.576 --> 04:41.141
And then suddenly,
he couldn't breathe.

04:41.210 --> 04:41.909
Get a stat chest xray.

04:41.977 --> 04:46.113
Make it a ct.

04:46.182 --> 04:47.182
And get more information.

04:50.319 --> 04:53.587
On my count, one, two, three.

04:53.656 --> 04:54.656
There we go.

05:00.596 --> 05:01.807
Has his lung function
been getting worse?

05:01.831 --> 05:04.899
He's been in the icu three
times in the last five months.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.011
Yeah, dr. Rhodes
has him at the top of.

05:06.035 --> 05:09.937
The transplant list for lungs,
but so far, nothing.

05:10.006 --> 05:10.671
He's got a pneumothorax
on the right,

05:10.740 --> 05:13.574
Significant rales on the left.

05:13.643 --> 05:16.477
Set me up for
a 16 french chest tube.

05:16.546 --> 05:19.380
That's a little invasive.
We can use a pigtail catheter.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.314
His lungs are too stiff.
He needs a tube.

05:20.383 --> 05:22.717
Which will only cause
additional trauma.

05:22.785 --> 05:23.951
It's bad, isn't it?

05:24.020 --> 05:28.389
The collapsed lung means
that your lungs are so scarred.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.392
That they can't
hold together, so...

05:31.461 --> 05:34.428
Yeah, buddy, it's bad.

05:34.497 --> 05:37.331
Look, as soon as we get
your lung reinflated,

05:37.400 --> 05:38.477
I'm gonna sit down with you
and your mom and your dad,

05:38.501 --> 05:42.503
And we're gonna talk about
what comes next, okay?

05:43.406 --> 05:47.075
Chest tube, 16 french.
Lidocaine?

05:48.211 --> 05:50.945
All right, buddy, you're
gonna feel a little pinch,

05:51.014 --> 05:51.746
Followed by some pressure, okay?

05:51.815 --> 05:54.749
There you go, buddy.

05:54.818 --> 05:55.383
You're okay, you're okay.

05:55.452 --> 05:59.020
You're doing great, pal.

06:02.359 --> 06:06.027
Mr. Thomas, I'm dr. Halstead.

06:06.096 --> 06:06.861
I heard you had
an incident at work today.

06:06.930 --> 06:11.633
Yeah, I guess I, fell down.

06:11.701 --> 06:15.103
The ems report says
they found you unconscious.

06:15.172 --> 06:17.939
How long you been
coughing up blood?

06:18.008 --> 06:21.242
A few weeks.

06:24.281 --> 06:27.015
Some wheezing and stridor.
What's his weight?

06:27.084 --> 06:27.816
138.

06:27.884 --> 06:30.619
Doc, I appreciate your concern,

06:30.687 --> 06:31.798
But I'd just as soon
go rest up at home.

06:31.822 --> 06:36.458
Yeah, I don't blame ya,
but I fear if you go home,

06:36.527 --> 06:38.960
You may have a far worse event.

06:39.029 --> 06:39.394
Than whatever happened
this morning.

06:39.463 --> 06:42.264
That's okay.

06:42.332 --> 06:45.867
Well, you're too dehydrated
to walk out of here,

06:45.936 --> 06:46.468
So why don't you let me
give you some fluids,

06:46.537 --> 06:48.904
We'll run some tests,

06:48.972 --> 06:50.939
And I promise I'll be back soon?

06:53.978 --> 06:54.978
All right.

06:59.216 --> 07:03.218
Syncope, weight loss,
hemoptysis.

07:03.287 --> 07:04.052
He's got cancer, right?

07:04.121 --> 07:05.131
A lot of people
are more afraid of.

07:05.155 --> 07:09.024
Getting the diagnosis
than the actual treatment.

07:09.093 --> 07:11.193
Let's get a cbc with diff, ekg,

07:11.262 --> 07:12.127
Chest xray, and ct.

07:12.196 --> 07:15.064
And then we can try
and talk to him again.

07:23.074 --> 07:25.841
So, um, robert haywood is here.

07:25.910 --> 07:26.842
For a thoracic p.E.T. Scan?

07:26.911 --> 07:28.155
Yeah, we're doing
a full cardiac workup.

07:28.179 --> 07:31.513
You think you could add
a... a head study of that for me?

07:31.582 --> 07:34.083
I just wanna make sure I'm not
missing anything on my end.

07:34.151 --> 07:35.271
Sure, no problem. Thank you.

07:41.325 --> 07:42.158
Iaura...

07:42.226 --> 07:45.628
Your membranes
ruptured prematurely,

07:45.696 --> 07:46.707
Allowing an infection
in your uterus.

07:46.731 --> 07:49.532
The longer we go without
delivering this baby,

07:49.600 --> 07:50.099
The greater the danger
you're both in.

07:50.168 --> 07:53.069
So deliver it then.

07:53.137 --> 07:53.836
We need to do it
at the hospital.

07:53.905 --> 07:54.770
No, I told you, I'm not going.

07:54.839 --> 07:57.707
I understand that
you don't want to,

07:57.775 --> 07:58.541
But this is a safety issue,
okay?

07:58.610 --> 08:01.544
You need to think
about your baby.

08:01.613 --> 08:02.613
I said no.

08:02.780 --> 08:03.446
If there are complications,
if anything goes wrong...

08:03.514 --> 08:06.782
It's okay, we'll do it here.

08:07.919 --> 08:10.887
You're not seriously thinking
about inducing her.

08:10.955 --> 08:12.021
Right here on the street?

08:12.090 --> 08:14.323
Women deliver outside
the hospital all the time.

08:14.392 --> 08:15.525
Yeah, and some of them die.

08:15.593 --> 08:16.492
Listen, I don't like this
either, but you heard her.

08:16.561 --> 08:19.228
She's gonna do this
with or without us.

08:19.297 --> 08:20.374
And then what? A newborn
can't survive out here.

08:20.398 --> 08:23.933
Nat, you don't have to
do this, but I'm staying.

08:29.207 --> 08:30.006
I have good news.

08:30.075 --> 08:30.640
They found a pair
of lungs in kansas.

08:30.709 --> 08:33.443
That are a perfect match.

08:33.510 --> 08:34.554
We're loading them
onto a plane now.

08:34.578 --> 08:37.413
My god. You hear that, luke?

08:37.482 --> 08:38.581
This is good news, buddy.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.583
I am gonna have
a conversation with dr. Bekker,

08:41.653 --> 08:44.487
And I'll be back in
just a few minutes, okay?

08:46.224 --> 08:46.556
I'll start
the transplant protocol.

08:46.625 --> 08:50.260
Hold on.

08:50.328 --> 08:53.463
We have to put him on ecmo.
What?

08:53.532 --> 08:54.575
He's satting in the 80s
and wearing down.

08:54.599 --> 08:59.202
His respiratory muscles
are going to give out.

08:59.271 --> 09:00.170
But ecmo could introduce
an infection.

09:00.238 --> 09:02.806
It's a partial contraindication
to surgery.

09:02.874 --> 09:04.018
And kansas is a twohour flight.

09:04.042 --> 09:08.345
We have to keep him oxygenated
till the lungs get here.

09:08.413 --> 09:09.312
Those lungs only last
four hours.

09:09.381 --> 09:12.949
If anything goes wrong
before they get here,

09:13.018 --> 09:13.750
And he's stuck on ecmo,

09:13.819 --> 09:16.153
We may not be able
to get him off.

09:16.221 --> 09:17.154
He could die.

09:17.222 --> 09:20.290
Then we make sure that
nothing goes wrong.

09:24.730 --> 09:25.162
Thank you.

09:25.230 --> 09:28.198
Mr. Thomas...

09:31.503 --> 09:35.172
We found a large growth
in your larynx.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.808
It's almost certainly cancer.

09:37.877 --> 09:41.879
All right.

09:41.947 --> 09:42.779
Now, the good news is,

09:42.848 --> 09:43.992
We have an excellent
oncology department,

09:44.016 --> 09:47.217
So I'd like to arrange for
a biopsy and a consultation,

09:47.286 --> 09:50.053
So they can determine...
It's okay.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.021
I'm not interested.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.691
Mr. Thomas, the sooner
you begin treatment,

09:53.759 --> 09:56.093
The better your chances
of survival.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.662
You don't understand. I'm...

09:58.731 --> 10:00.698
I'm ready to die.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.502
I know it's a lot
of information,

10:05.571 --> 10:08.272
And it can seem overwhelming,
but I...

10:08.341 --> 10:10.774
I said no.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.381
Can you tell me why you're
so resistant to treatment?

10:18.184 --> 10:22.353
Because I've made it 56 years.

10:22.422 --> 10:25.423
Without molesting a child,

10:25.491 --> 10:29.060
And I can't stand it anymore.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.128
I'm sorry?

10:32.365 --> 10:35.933
I'm a pedophile...

10:36.002 --> 10:38.269
And I wanna die.

10:45.770 --> 10:46.770
Yeah?

10:46.872 --> 10:50.440
Have you seen this yet?

10:50.509 --> 10:51.509
A lawsuit?

10:51.576 --> 10:52.787
An indigent man's claiming
an ambulance driver.

10:52.811 --> 10:57.280
Passed him over to bring in
an insured patient instead.

10:57.349 --> 10:59.883
Seems the extra wait time
cost this guy his leg.

10:59.952 --> 11:00.952
That's terrible.

11:01.019 --> 11:04.521
But isn't that the fault
of the ambulance company?

11:04.590 --> 11:05.188
Apparently the ambulance
driver was following.

11:05.257 --> 11:08.992
Our hospital's instructions.

11:09.061 --> 11:10.061
Now that's ridiculous.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.063
I never told anyone
to pass up uninsured patients.

11:13.132 --> 11:15.832
No, but the claimant states.

11:15.901 --> 11:20.170
That an e.D. Charge nurse
named maggie lockwood did.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.642
Give me some time
to look into it.

11:28.681 --> 11:29.880
Try to relax, all right?

11:29.949 --> 11:32.109
Look at me, look at me,
look at me. Take a deep breath.

11:38.057 --> 11:38.755
104.

11:38.824 --> 11:39.556
The antibiotics aren't working.

11:39.625 --> 11:42.159
We need a couple bags of flagyl.

11:42.228 --> 11:43.360
Ethan... I need more drugs?

11:46.766 --> 11:47.809
You're putting yourself and
your baby at unnecessary risk.

11:47.833 --> 11:51.502
She can't. They'll put her
back into foster care.

11:51.570 --> 11:52.748
I know it's not ideal,
but this isn't just about you.

11:52.772 --> 11:56.440
Your baby's gonna need food
and a roof over its head.

11:56.509 --> 11:57.308
Unless they keep 'em
out in the yard,

11:57.376 --> 11:59.743
Feed 'em whatever
the dogs don't want.

11:59.812 --> 12:00.511
I'll talk to the social worker,

12:00.579 --> 12:03.280
Make sure you find a good home.

12:03.349 --> 12:04.359
No one wants to adopt
a 16yearold.

12:04.383 --> 12:07.952
Even if you do get
a good home in foster care,

12:08.020 --> 12:08.786
Everyone keeps getting
passed along,

12:08.855 --> 12:09.787
Until you finally
end up some place.

12:09.856 --> 12:12.723
Where they'd rather cash
a check from the state.

12:12.792 --> 12:13.691
Than feed you.

12:13.759 --> 12:17.194
Yeah, they're the ones
who keep you forever.

12:20.633 --> 12:21.643
Nat, we really need
those antibiotics.

12:21.667 --> 12:25.069
Okay, I'll be back
as soon as I can.

12:25.138 --> 12:26.003
Yeah.

12:26.072 --> 12:29.240
Okay, keep breathing,
keep breathing.

12:29.309 --> 12:30.041
Okay? Keep breathing.

12:30.109 --> 12:32.577
Just try to relax. It's okay.

12:32.645 --> 12:33.645
Dr. Rhodes?

12:42.689 --> 12:45.056
What's wrong?

12:45.125 --> 12:47.992
Luke's lfts are rising.

12:48.061 --> 12:49.227
What... what does that mean?

12:49.295 --> 12:53.231
It indicates that he might be
in early liver failure.

12:53.299 --> 12:55.967
Unfortunately, if it progresses,

12:56.036 --> 12:58.770
It could prevent him
from getting the lungs.

12:58.838 --> 12:59.838
Prevent him?

12:59.973 --> 13:00.805
Fortunately, we can still
get him off the ecmo,

13:00.874 --> 13:03.741
While we try to
reverse this trend.

13:03.810 --> 13:07.178
However, if we take him
off of ecmo now,

13:07.247 --> 13:07.812
It decreases the odds
that he survives.

13:07.881 --> 13:08.913
Until the lungs get here.

13:08.982 --> 13:13.651
I don't understand.
Can't you agree on what to do?

13:13.720 --> 13:15.987
It's not a black and white
situation.

13:19.326 --> 13:22.660
You've been treating him,
dr. Rhodes.

13:22.729 --> 13:23.729
What should we do?

13:27.401 --> 13:28.511
We should keep him on the ecmo.

13:28.535 --> 13:33.505
It's still our best chance
that he gets those lungs.

13:33.573 --> 13:34.172
Okay.

13:34.241 --> 13:38.610
Yes. That's what we'll do.

13:38.679 --> 13:39.679
All right.

13:44.952 --> 13:46.062
You're being completely
irresponsible.

13:46.086 --> 13:49.554
That kid is going to die
if he doesn't get new lungs.

13:49.623 --> 13:52.324
Only if your ecmo
doesn't kill him first.

13:52.393 --> 13:53.291
He's a snowball
rolling down a hill,

13:53.360 --> 13:56.194
And this is our last chance
to stop it.

14:03.537 --> 14:07.406
So what are we doing
about mr. Thomas?

14:07.474 --> 14:08.307
Psych's in there right now.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.419
As soon as they declare him
incompetent,

14:09.443 --> 14:12.878
I'm gonna call oncology
down here to get started.

14:12.947 --> 14:13.846
Incompetent?

14:13.914 --> 14:17.649
Who cares?
The man is a pedophile, okay?

14:17.718 --> 14:20.219
If he wants to die,
why don't we just let him?

14:20.287 --> 14:21.186
April, we're going
to stop him from dying,

14:21.255 --> 14:26.525
Because he's our patient
and because we can.

14:31.532 --> 14:32.464
Did you put him on a psych hold?

14:32.533 --> 14:34.900
I'm not ready
to make that decision.

14:34.969 --> 14:35.834
Why? He's suicidal.

14:35.903 --> 14:39.071
He may want to die,
but he is lucid.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.774
And understands the
consequences of his choices.

14:41.843 --> 14:42.920
He... he has
a treatable condition.

14:42.944 --> 14:45.678
How lucid can he be if
he's not letting us treat it?

14:45.746 --> 14:46.479
If he was depressed,
you'd put him on a psych hold.

14:46.547 --> 14:49.248
And try and treat
his depression.

14:49.317 --> 14:50.394
You're not gonna do
the same for pedophilia?

14:50.418 --> 14:53.686
I just don't know that much
about pedophilia.

14:53.755 --> 14:56.555
Well, you better find out
fast, because he's dying.

14:56.624 --> 14:59.525
Department charge nurse
maggie lockwood,

14:59.594 --> 15:00.671
Especially providing incentive.

15:00.695 --> 15:03.429
I don't believe this.
All right, take it easy.

15:03.498 --> 15:03.796
What do you know
about this patient?

15:03.865 --> 15:06.599
I don't.

15:06.668 --> 15:07.600
And I definitely never told
any ambulance driver.

15:07.669 --> 15:10.603
To make decisions based on
insurance coverage.

15:10.672 --> 15:13.773
All right.
This driver, john gates,

15:13.842 --> 15:14.919
Do you know him?
Yeah, he's a jerk.

15:14.943 --> 15:18.911
Page me when he comes in.

15:18.980 --> 15:19.746
I wanna talk to him.

15:19.814 --> 15:23.416
Sure...
If I don't kill him first.

15:24.419 --> 15:26.886
I need a doctor in here.
Help him!

15:30.992 --> 15:34.460
He's coagulopathic.
What does that mean?

15:34.529 --> 15:35.361
The combination of
his poor liver function.

15:35.430 --> 15:38.264
And the anticoagulants
that we gave him.

15:38.333 --> 15:38.865
Has disrupted
his ability to clot.

15:38.934 --> 15:41.634
Hang a bag of heparin.

15:41.703 --> 15:42.847
We thinned his blood
for the ecmo, we had to,

15:42.871 --> 15:45.471
But his liver is failing
more quickly than we expected.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.439
You did this,
so take him off that machine!

15:46.508 --> 15:49.776
I am afraid that it is
too late for that.

15:49.845 --> 15:50.310
Too late?

15:50.378 --> 15:51.378
Heparin's running.

15:51.446 --> 15:54.981
We're gonna try
and reverse the bleeding now.

15:55.050 --> 15:57.584
Run the plasma now.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.652
Hold on that.

16:04.059 --> 16:05.191
Wait...

16:05.260 --> 16:09.496
A transfusion is going to
increase his antibody count.

16:09.565 --> 16:10.463
His pra's already at 50.

16:10.532 --> 16:11.643
If it hits 80,
we can't use those lungs.

16:11.667 --> 16:14.701
You think I don't know that?
We don't have a choice.

16:14.770 --> 16:15.880
We wouldn't be in this situation.

16:15.904 --> 16:16.636
If you hadn't insisted on ecmo
in the first place.

16:16.705 --> 16:19.639
You keep pointing out problems.

16:19.708 --> 16:20.474
What I need are solutions,
so if you don't have any,

16:20.542 --> 16:23.009
Just... just get out of my way,
okay?

16:23.545 --> 16:26.847
Hang the bags.

16:37.997 --> 16:38.896
Is this man, this pedophile,
really being rational?

16:38.965 --> 16:42.700
Funny enough,
it sounds to me like he is.

16:42.769 --> 16:43.929
So we just have to, stand by.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.637
And watch him kill himself?
Not treating your cancer.

16:46.706 --> 16:47.750
Is not the same thing
as committing suicide.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.875
I mean, it's his decision.
He's allowed to make it.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.511
More to the point, I think
what he may be trying to do.

16:53.580 --> 16:57.782
Is looking for a way to...
Escape his urges.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.983
By dying.

16:59.052 --> 16:59.851
Dr. Reese, have you ever seen
a pedophile's p.E.T. Scan?

16:59.919 --> 17:03.621
The prefrontal cortex
and the putamen,

17:03.690 --> 17:04.555
They... they light up.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.556
There's a very good chance
that pedophilia.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.761
Could be genetically
hardwired into the brain.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.996
There... there... there's nothing
he can do about it?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.131
Well, yes and no.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.099
I mean, the thinking is,
you can't change the hardware,

17:16.169 --> 17:17.280
But the software
is another question,

17:17.304 --> 17:19.904
And it sounds to me like...
Like that's what mr. Thomas.

17:19.973 --> 17:20.805
Has been trying to do.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.907
If you look at it
from his perspective,

17:23.977 --> 17:27.111
The whole thing
seems quite rational.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.450
Hey, what are you doing here
on your day off?

17:32.519 --> 17:35.153
Don't ask. Don't ask?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.154
I'm not crazy about
what I'm doing,

17:36.223 --> 17:37.300
And I will tell you
the whole thing later,

17:37.324 --> 17:40.725
But right now, I just need
to get something and go.

17:43.764 --> 17:47.265
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.271
Hey!

17:53.340 --> 17:56.508
Everyone out, please.

17:56.577 --> 17:57.577
You stay.

18:00.481 --> 18:01.413
John gates,
this is sharon goodwin,

18:01.482 --> 18:05.283
The executive director
of patient services.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.151
You might stand up.

18:06.220 --> 18:10.055
Did you speak to anyone recently.

18:10.124 --> 18:10.956
Regarding a lawsuit?

18:11.024 --> 18:13.592
Yeah, lawyers asked me
some questions.

18:13.661 --> 18:14.826
And what did you say?

18:14.895 --> 18:18.196
I said you guys only wanted
patients with good insurance,

18:18.265 --> 18:20.799
So I brought you
what you wanted.

18:20.868 --> 18:24.970
And where exactly
did you get that idea?

18:25.039 --> 18:25.370
Look around.

18:25.439 --> 18:28.841
Excuse me?

18:28.909 --> 18:31.677
The tv. The pizza?

18:31.745 --> 18:32.611
Everyone knows
this room's just a ploy.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.813
To get us to bring in
paying customers.

18:37.852 --> 18:39.518
Get out of here.

18:49.463 --> 18:52.431
Sharon...

18:54.535 --> 18:58.604
I never intended for him
to leave people on the street.

18:58.673 --> 19:01.140
He's not the problem.

19:15.490 --> 19:16.522
Dr. Bekker...

19:18.660 --> 19:21.894
You disagree with dr. Rhodes'
treatment, don't you?

19:21.963 --> 19:25.031
It's a complicated situation.

19:25.099 --> 19:26.099
Okay.

19:28.770 --> 19:32.705
I know... How hard it must be.

19:32.774 --> 19:35.341
Watching him go through this.

19:35.410 --> 19:36.075
It is...

19:36.144 --> 19:40.446
And it has been for 12 years.

19:41.349 --> 19:45.184
Modulator therapies,
clinical trials.

19:45.253 --> 19:48.554
It's all we ever thought about,
but nothing ever worked.

19:48.623 --> 19:51.624
After a while, we just wanted
to let luke be a kid,

19:51.693 --> 19:53.860
While he still had the chance.

19:54.362 --> 19:56.963
But now, I'm...

19:57.899 --> 20:01.701
Maybe there was more
we could've done.

20:01.770 --> 20:05.004
Did we just let
our little boy die?

20:06.174 --> 20:11.778
There are no right answers
with cystic fibrosis.

20:11.847 --> 20:12.746
It's relentless.

20:12.814 --> 20:16.549
And impervious to
whatever we throw at it.

20:17.586 --> 20:22.022
But every decision
you made for your son,

20:22.090 --> 20:24.324
You made out of love...

20:25.661 --> 20:28.161
And I believe that whenever
you do something out of love,

20:28.230 --> 20:30.730
It can never really be wrong.

20:49.351 --> 20:52.552
Dr. Halstead!

20:55.391 --> 20:56.023
Sats are down to 78.

20:56.091 --> 21:00.093
Did you eat this morning?

21:00.162 --> 21:01.306
He might be obstructed.
Laryngoscope on the gills.

21:01.330 --> 21:03.931
Give him a sublingual nitro
and an amp of glucagon.

21:03.999 --> 21:04.898
The food must've gotten
trapped by your tumor,

21:04.967 --> 21:07.534
And it's starting
to block your airway.

21:07.603 --> 21:10.170
I need to break it up.
Please, don't.

21:10.239 --> 21:11.338
What about his dnr?

21:11.407 --> 21:12.417
I'm not tubing him,
I'm just clearing his airway.

21:12.441 --> 21:16.610
Mr. Thomas, I am legally
obligated to do this.

21:16.679 --> 21:17.759
It will only take a moment.

21:24.053 --> 21:25.053
Forceps?

21:29.225 --> 21:29.990
Almost there. Got it.

21:30.059 --> 21:33.727
That's it, mr. Thomas.

21:33.796 --> 21:36.363
Take a few deep breaths...

21:36.432 --> 21:39.200
Deep breaths.

21:39.268 --> 21:40.034
God damn it.

21:40.103 --> 21:44.238
Why won't you people
just let me die?

21:55.351 --> 21:58.452
Well, I don't see any tumors
or signs of stroke.

21:58.521 --> 22:01.389
Robert haywood, is he one of
your prison patients?

22:01.457 --> 22:02.056
Um, no. Why?

22:02.125 --> 22:04.759
He's a criminal, right?

22:04.828 --> 22:05.828
Not that I know of.

22:05.862 --> 22:09.230
Decreased activity
in the lower frontal lobe,

22:09.299 --> 22:10.376
Significant reductions in
the orbital prefrontal cortex,

22:10.400 --> 22:14.802
Which is the regulator of
morality and aggression.

22:14.871 --> 22:18.106
Psychopath. Well, in my opinion,

22:18.174 --> 22:18.940
The best thing you can do
for this patient.

22:19.009 --> 22:22.076
Is to put a pillow
over his head.

22:27.517 --> 22:30.285
How's he doing?

22:30.353 --> 22:31.286
Not great.

22:31.354 --> 22:32.431
His larynx is still
partially obstructed,

22:32.455 --> 22:36.458
And now I need ent to come
clear it out completely.

22:36.526 --> 22:37.537
Are you putting him on a hold?

22:37.561 --> 22:41.830
Dr. Charles believes
he is rational. We can't.

22:41.898 --> 22:42.898
So that's that?

22:42.933 --> 22:46.634
What, we just let him die?
Not necessarily.

22:46.703 --> 22:49.004
Since he is rational,

22:49.072 --> 22:51.006
Maybe we can reason with him.

22:54.878 --> 22:57.946
Fine, as soon
as he's cleaned up.

23:06.256 --> 23:09.124
Why are you fighting
so hard for this guy?

23:12.162 --> 23:14.696
Because it's not my job
to judge him.

23:24.341 --> 23:27.075
I just got the call.
The lungs are ten minutes out.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.511
His cardiac output is down,
urine too.

23:29.580 --> 23:30.045
He's in multiorgan failure.

23:30.114 --> 23:32.414
Bp's 90 over 50.

23:33.384 --> 23:34.016
He's not going to be
stable enough for surgery.

23:34.084 --> 23:36.618
This doesn't make any sense.

23:36.687 --> 23:37.352
Cystic fibrosis is
a chronic disease.

23:37.421 --> 23:40.589
This is all happening too fast.

23:40.658 --> 23:42.018
Only since you put him
on the ecmo.

23:43.928 --> 23:44.526
These are symptoms
of underperfusion.

23:44.595 --> 23:48.263
It shouldn't happen on ecmo.

23:48.332 --> 23:51.734
Unless the problem is
with the ecmo itself.

23:52.503 --> 23:55.237
Let me see your readings.

23:55.940 --> 23:59.041
The flow rate's too slow.

23:59.110 --> 24:00.287
How long's it been at 2.6?
Couple hours.

24:00.311 --> 24:04.480
Did you interrogate the line?
Yeah, it was clean.

24:04.549 --> 24:04.980
You think it's the oxygenator?

24:05.049 --> 24:06.081
Let's find out.

24:06.150 --> 24:09.318
His sats are gonna drop.
We gotta do this fast.

24:09.387 --> 24:10.387
Turn the fio2 up to 100.

24:10.455 --> 24:13.556
Shut down ecmo.
What? You're turning it off?

24:13.624 --> 24:14.123
I thought it was
keeping him alive.

24:14.192 --> 24:15.291
Sats are down to 80.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.427
We think there might be
a clot in the oxygenator.

24:18.496 --> 24:19.128
That would impede
the blood flow enough.

24:19.197 --> 24:19.462
To cause his organs to fail.

24:19.530 --> 24:22.598
75.

24:22.667 --> 24:25.801
Set. Set.

24:26.204 --> 24:27.204
Got it.

24:27.238 --> 24:30.806
It must've happened
when we hung the plasma.

24:30.875 --> 24:31.875
Ecmo back on.

24:36.181 --> 24:37.181
Flow rate's at 4.

24:39.984 --> 24:42.919
Sats are coming back up. 83...

24:42.987 --> 24:43.519
85...

24:43.588 --> 24:46.556
Is he gonna be okay?

24:46.624 --> 24:47.357
He's getting oxygen
back to his organs.

24:47.425 --> 24:50.159
The failure should be
reversible.

24:50.228 --> 24:51.260
Thank god.

24:51.329 --> 24:54.631
Dr. Rhodes, dr. Bekker...
The lungs are here.

24:54.699 --> 24:57.100
All right, let's get him
upstairs. Come on.

24:57.168 --> 24:57.433
You can still do the transplant?

24:57.502 --> 24:58.034
Yes.

24:58.103 --> 25:01.538
It's okay.

25:01.606 --> 25:04.007
Come on!

25:04.075 --> 25:05.075
All right, let's go.

25:05.143 --> 25:08.611
You got this!

25:08.680 --> 25:09.412
Good job, laura. Good job.
You're doing great.

25:09.481 --> 25:10.380
Nat, we've been pushing for 30.

25:10.449 --> 25:12.916
Come on.
Keep pushing, keep pushing.

25:12.984 --> 25:13.783
I can't. There you go.

25:13.852 --> 25:14.896
You can do this,
you can do this, okay?

25:14.920 --> 25:17.821
Push, push, push, push,
push, push, push, push...

25:17.889 --> 25:18.254
good job. There you go.

25:18.323 --> 25:21.057
There you go.

25:21.126 --> 25:22.337
All right, keep pushing, laura.

25:22.361 --> 25:23.471
You're doing great. Keep going.
Okay, I see the head.

25:23.495 --> 25:26.730
Push, push, push, push...

25:29.668 --> 25:30.433
Okay, here it comes.
Here it comes.

25:30.502 --> 25:32.869
Is it out?

25:32.938 --> 25:33.770
Nat...

25:33.839 --> 25:37.040
What's wrong? Shoulder dystocia.

25:37.109 --> 25:38.041
The head is through
the birth canal,

25:38.110 --> 25:41.077
But the shoulders are too big.
It's stuck.

25:41.146 --> 25:42.012
Stuck? What do you mean stuck?

25:42.080 --> 25:43.013
Don't worry,
we're gonna get it out,

25:43.081 --> 25:43.947
But we need to hurry.
Call an ambulance.

25:44.016 --> 25:47.050
What? No, I'm not
calling an ambulance.

25:47.119 --> 25:48.051
Call an ambulance.
What are you...

25:48.120 --> 25:51.121
What are you doing?
No, no, what's going on?

25:51.190 --> 25:51.955
You're okay. What are you doing?

25:52.024 --> 25:52.522
We're just gonna
pick your leg up.

25:52.591 --> 25:55.993
You're gonna be fine.

25:56.061 --> 25:57.138
What are those for?
An episiotomy.

25:57.162 --> 26:01.698
I need to cut a wider hole
for the baby to come out.

26:01.767 --> 26:04.001
I'm sorry,
but this is gonna hurt.

26:04.069 --> 26:05.002
Can't you numb her?

26:05.070 --> 26:06.148
Not with the head this close,
not out here.

26:06.172 --> 26:09.373
I'll push harder.
I... i'll get it to come out!

26:09.441 --> 26:10.307
Laura, we are past that
right now, okay?

26:10.376 --> 26:13.610
I need you to just be strong
for your baby.

26:13.679 --> 26:14.578
I can't... i can't...

26:14.647 --> 26:18.382
Laura, I promise you
it will be worth it.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.651
Now, are you ready? Yes?

26:20.720 --> 26:21.720
Okay.

26:24.890 --> 26:27.591
All right, you got it.

26:27.660 --> 26:28.660
You got it.

26:31.597 --> 26:32.229
You did it!

26:32.298 --> 26:35.799
You did it. Great job, laura.

26:39.438 --> 26:42.473
It's a beautiful girl.

26:44.710 --> 26:45.710
Hi.

26:47.814 --> 26:48.814
Hi.

26:52.285 --> 26:53.285
Hi.

26:55.755 --> 26:58.089
Hi.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.646
Left lung is free. Yep.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.916
Lungs are coming out.

27:15.985 --> 27:16.216
Keep the heart elevated.

27:16.285 --> 27:19.787
Okay.

27:19.855 --> 27:20.855
All right.

27:25.027 --> 27:27.695
Let's sew these new lungs in.

27:27.763 --> 27:31.198
Dr. Bekker's gonna
take the lead.

27:31.267 --> 27:32.333
Me? Yes.

27:32.401 --> 27:37.805
But he's your patient.
You are the better choice.

27:37.874 --> 27:38.906
Why would you say that?

27:38.975 --> 27:39.540
You've been fighting me
tooth and nail all day.

27:39.609 --> 27:42.543
Your hands are smaller.

27:42.612 --> 27:44.732
It'll be easier for you to work
in the confined space.

27:44.781 --> 27:45.813
I see.

27:45.882 --> 27:50.418
And is that the only reason?
The size of my hands?

27:50.486 --> 27:52.887
Also, you are
an excellent surgeon.

27:55.725 --> 27:57.825
All right.

27:57.894 --> 27:58.894
Stitch?

28:10.173 --> 28:12.507
My apologies, sharon.
This is my fault.

28:12.575 --> 28:13.508
The pizza room was my idea.

28:13.576 --> 28:14.820
No, maggie, I was in
full support of it,

28:14.844 --> 28:19.881
And never stopped to think
about what we were encouraging.

28:30.594 --> 28:32.827
How are you feeling?

28:32.896 --> 28:35.864
Just let me go.

28:38.035 --> 28:40.435
Mr. Thomas,
I can't begin to imagine.

28:40.504 --> 28:41.504
What your life is like...

28:43.807 --> 28:44.439
But one thing I know is
that it can't get better.

28:44.508 --> 28:47.909
Unless you let me help you.

28:47.978 --> 28:48.810
Now, I've talked
to the oncologist...

28:48.879 --> 28:52.480
Enough.
And we have a real chance.

28:52.549 --> 28:53.693
At getting you into remission.

28:53.717 --> 28:58.320
Please, just take a few minutes
to at least consider it.

29:03.427 --> 29:06.428
Mr. Thomas,
can I ask you a question?

29:08.098 --> 29:09.098
You have a job, right?

29:09.166 --> 29:12.801
Coworkers, do you get along
with some of them?

29:12.870 --> 29:15.437
Yeah. So?

29:15.506 --> 29:17.839
How about interests?

29:17.908 --> 29:21.710
Reading? Sports?

29:21.779 --> 29:22.611
What's your point?

29:22.680 --> 29:26.782
That you are not
just a pedophile.

29:26.851 --> 29:28.091
There is more to you than that.

29:30.454 --> 29:31.498
And I understand
that you have been.

29:31.522 --> 29:33.889
Challenged by your thoughts
your entire life,

29:33.958 --> 29:35.038
But you have overcome them.

29:37.261 --> 29:38.160
Maybe this cancer is
just another challenge,

29:38.229 --> 29:41.964
Something that you can
overcome as well,

29:42.033 --> 29:43.065
So you can get back to.

29:43.134 --> 29:45.534
All of the parts of your life
that you do like.

29:45.603 --> 29:48.604
Doctor, I have an itch...

29:48.673 --> 29:51.807
Every second of every day.

29:51.876 --> 29:54.510
To scratch it
would feel so good,

29:54.579 --> 29:57.980
But I don't, ever.

29:58.049 --> 30:00.616
Not scratching that itch.

30:00.685 --> 30:04.620
Is the worst hell
that I can imagine,

30:04.689 --> 30:07.256
And cancer is gonna
get me out of that hell.

30:08.025 --> 30:11.394
It isn't another challenge...

30:11.996 --> 30:16.599
Cancer is my reward.

30:22.774 --> 30:23.506
So, bob, I know that we haven't.

30:23.575 --> 30:26.175
Known each other
very long at all,

30:26.244 --> 30:26.742
But from what I've observed.

30:26.811 --> 30:29.745
And our conversations,

30:29.814 --> 30:32.381
It's my opinion that you evident.

30:32.450 --> 30:34.584
Some of the hallmark
characteristics.

30:34.652 --> 30:35.351
Of something known as.

30:35.420 --> 30:39.122
Antisocial personality disorder.

30:39.190 --> 30:42.024
Interesting.

30:42.093 --> 30:44.861
That could explain
a lot about my life.

30:44.929 --> 30:45.828
I mean, divorces,

30:45.897 --> 30:49.232
Problems with colleagues.
Right, right.

30:49.301 --> 30:50.099
Well, you should know that
it's very manageable. I mean...

30:50.168 --> 30:53.102
No, I... i've got things handled.

30:53.171 --> 30:54.070
I'm okay. Are you, though?

30:54.139 --> 30:57.540
Because, very honestly,
from what I've seen,

30:57.609 --> 31:00.944
That you aren't in fact
always the best judge.

31:01.012 --> 31:03.246
Of your own selfinterest.

31:03.315 --> 31:04.180
What do you mean?

31:04.249 --> 31:05.148
Well, you have
significant heart disease,

31:05.217 --> 31:08.852
Which, one way or the other,
is gonna require.

31:08.920 --> 31:09.986
Serious longterm care.

31:10.055 --> 31:14.124
Your plan is to have your
daughter provide that care,

31:14.192 --> 31:15.225
A daughter whose father.

31:15.293 --> 31:19.029
Has suddenly reappeared
in her life after 20 years.

31:19.097 --> 31:21.698
I mean, she's gonna have
trust issues,

31:21.767 --> 31:22.499
Abandonment issues.

31:22.567 --> 31:23.678
What I'm saying is
if you want this.

31:23.702 --> 31:27.337
To work out with sarah,
it would be a really good idea.

31:27.406 --> 31:30.674
To discuss this
personality disorder.

31:30.742 --> 31:31.908
And why would that help me?

31:31.977 --> 31:34.978
Well, first of all, I think
she'd appreciate your candor.

31:35.047 --> 31:36.157
She'd be comforted
by your honesty.

31:36.181 --> 31:39.416
More importantly, it would
shed a huge amount of light.

31:39.485 --> 31:40.350
On... on her life,

31:40.419 --> 31:43.487
On what transpired
between the two of you.

31:43.555 --> 31:45.989
I think, ultimately,
she'd embrace your care,

31:46.058 --> 31:46.823
She'd throw herself into it,

31:46.892 --> 31:47.824
And that the time
you spend together.

31:47.893 --> 31:52.462
Would just be much richer
for the both of you.

31:52.531 --> 31:54.998
Or she could have
the opposite reaction.

31:55.067 --> 31:57.701
Antisocial personality disorder?

31:57.770 --> 31:58.602
I mean, that's like saying
I'm a psychopath.

31:58.671 --> 32:01.872
I mean, when people
hear that word,

32:01.941 --> 32:04.575
They run in the opposite
direction.

32:04.643 --> 32:07.978
Labels, semantics can be toxic.

32:08.047 --> 32:09.124
Whatever the case,
all I'm saying is that

32:09.148 --> 32:12.850
I think it would be very much
in your best interest.

32:12.918 --> 32:15.486
To share this
with your daughter.

32:23.095 --> 32:25.429
She's so happy.

32:25.498 --> 32:27.565
All she does is smile.

32:32.738 --> 32:33.537
Laura...

32:33.606 --> 32:37.107
We need to take you
to the hospital.

32:40.146 --> 32:40.878
You said I could stay here.

32:40.947 --> 32:44.648
You could give birth out here,

32:44.717 --> 32:45.383
But it's not a safe place
to keep her.

32:45.451 --> 32:49.320
It's too cold. She'll freeze.

32:49.389 --> 32:52.256
But if we come in, we'll
have to go to foster care.

32:53.226 --> 32:58.095
She's too good for that.
I won't let her.

32:58.164 --> 32:58.963
Laura...

32:59.032 --> 33:02.133
I'm sorry,
but we don't have a choice.

33:11.745 --> 33:15.847
Take her without me. What?

33:17.016 --> 33:22.720
Babies with 16yearold mothers
go into foster care.

33:22.789 --> 33:23.829
But babies on their own...

33:25.659 --> 33:27.926
Get adopted into nice families.

33:30.797 --> 33:33.131
Laura, this is your baby.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.400
You'll never see her again.

33:36.002 --> 33:39.704
I know.

33:39.773 --> 33:41.739
You don't have to do this.

33:48.115 --> 33:50.548
You're gonna have a good life.

34:24.728 --> 34:27.864
We're settling that case
out of court.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.143
Yeah, I figured the hospital
wouldn't want the bad press.

34:29.167 --> 34:31.935
We'll move on. Hopefully,
it's just an isolated incident.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.003
It should be.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.485
It turns out the pizza room
was the source of the problem,

34:35.540 --> 34:36.540
So I shut it down.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.143
Wait, what?
I shut down the pizza room.

34:40.212 --> 34:43.246
No. No, no, no, the board's
not gonna let you do that.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.416
Why not? It was influencing
the decisionmaking.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.516
Of ambulance crews.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.286
And it's making this hospital
a lot of money.

34:50.355 --> 34:52.956
The e.D. Has shown
a 14% increase in revenue.

34:53.024 --> 34:53.889
Since it opened.
Are you serious?

34:53.958 --> 35:00.864
Sharon...
The pizza room stays open.

35:06.171 --> 35:09.005
His obstruction must be
eroding into the mucosa.

35:09.074 --> 35:09.873
Hang two units.

35:09.942 --> 35:10.707
Vic, you're losing
too much blood.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.610
I need to cauterize the vessels.

35:13.679 --> 35:14.679
No... You don't.

35:14.713 --> 35:19.316
Hey, I'm sorry,
but I don't have a choice.

35:19.384 --> 35:23.787
Yes... You do.

35:23.856 --> 35:24.354
Hanging the blood.

35:24.423 --> 35:27.791
Get me a cautery.

35:27.860 --> 35:29.993
There's one in trauma 3. Okay.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.321
It won't be long.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.714
19:21.

36:36.696 --> 36:37.696
Hey, hey.

36:39.899 --> 36:43.134
How's it going, bud?
How's it feel?

36:43.203 --> 36:45.937
Sore, but good.

36:46.005 --> 36:46.671
Good.

36:46.739 --> 36:50.041
Well, don't go anywhere, okay?

36:50.109 --> 36:53.177
I'm gonna be back to check
on you in just a little bit.

36:58.451 --> 36:59.628
I have to admit,
your way worked.

36:59.652 --> 37:02.954
You got him to the finish line.
I think we both know.

37:03.023 --> 37:06.257
That I couldn't have
done this without you.

37:06.326 --> 37:09.294
Say...

37:09.362 --> 37:12.263
I cancelled my plans.

37:12.332 --> 37:16.801
Um... What do you say
we go get that drink?

37:21.041 --> 37:22.041
No.

37:23.744 --> 37:25.810
Last night was a mistake.

37:29.516 --> 37:32.183
I was wrong about laura.

37:32.252 --> 37:32.917
I don't know if I could've done
what she did.

37:32.986 --> 37:35.787
Those kids surprised me too.

37:35.856 --> 37:36.588
I just hate the thought
of them out there,

37:36.657 --> 37:39.524
Having to take care
of themselves.

37:39.593 --> 37:40.058
Yeah.

37:40.127 --> 37:43.795
There's dcfs.

37:43.864 --> 37:46.498
I got it. Okay.

37:51.004 --> 37:54.206
Hey, I am so sorry
about earlier.

37:54.274 --> 37:55.006
That's okay.

37:55.075 --> 37:57.609
It's just, I had the most awful,

37:57.678 --> 37:58.377
Yet the most incredible day.

37:58.445 --> 37:59.656
There is this girl
who lives at...

37:59.680 --> 38:03.048
Hey, nat, I'm not really
in the mood to talk right now.

38:03.117 --> 38:05.951
Okay. Are you all right?

38:06.020 --> 38:09.288
Yeah, it's just... Don't ask.

38:19.366 --> 38:20.366
Hey.

38:22.703 --> 38:24.803
That patient...

38:24.872 --> 38:25.637
I judged him.

38:25.706 --> 38:31.076
I should've just...
Been his nurse.

38:31.145 --> 38:35.381
Sometimes
it's really hard not to judge.

38:35.449 --> 38:36.449
I've been there.

38:38.786 --> 38:39.618
You mind if we,

38:39.687 --> 38:43.489
Take a rain check
on dinner tonight?

38:43.558 --> 38:44.558
Sure.

38:52.033 --> 38:54.500
Hey there.

38:55.036 --> 38:58.204
Everything okay?

39:01.109 --> 39:02.109
No.

39:02.143 --> 39:05.511
No, I, um... i just had
a long talk with my dad,

39:05.580 --> 39:08.547
And it turns out he has
class iii heart failure.

39:08.616 --> 39:09.348
From cardiomyopathy.

39:09.417 --> 39:13.219
Man. Very sorry to hear that.

39:13.288 --> 39:16.088
Yeah, you know, he said
he wasn't gonna tell me.

39:16.157 --> 39:18.958
Said he was afraid. Afraid?

39:19.027 --> 39:19.525
That he just came back
into my life,

39:19.594 --> 39:22.228
And now if he dies,

39:22.297 --> 39:23.162
He doesn't know
what it might do to me.

39:23.231 --> 39:26.199
Said he worries
he's giving me issues.

39:26.267 --> 39:29.068
With abandonment and trust.

39:29.137 --> 39:33.039
Wow, he said that?

39:33.108 --> 39:36.576
Yeah, as sick as he is,
he... he didn't wanna tell me.

39:37.245 --> 39:42.749
That is so... Selfless.

39:43.318 --> 39:46.386
You were right.

39:46.454 --> 39:48.694
Maybe I need to look at things
more from his perspective.

39:49.257 --> 39:52.058
Dr. Reese, did your...

39:52.127 --> 39:55.595
Did your father
tell you anything else?

39:55.664 --> 39:56.329
No. Why?

39:56.398 --> 39:59.432
I'm just curious, you know.

39:59.501 --> 40:01.668
Nothing else?

40:01.737 --> 40:02.737
No.

40:17.819 --> 40:20.987
Ethan. Hey.

40:21.056 --> 40:25.025
Why are you here?

40:25.093 --> 40:28.495
I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

40:32.067 --> 40:33.107
Maybe, I should've called.

40:35.604 --> 40:36.604
No, it's okay.

40:40.676 --> 40:41.676
Your hair's longer.

40:44.413 --> 40:44.745
Yeah.

40:44.813 --> 40:47.314
Yours is...

40:49.418 --> 40:50.418
Shorter.

40:58.394 --> 40:59.394
Okay if I come in?

41:02.898 --> 41:05.699
Yeah. Kay.
