05:34.758 --> 05:37.758
You had your chance, Lilly.

05:37.758 --> 05:42.965

Ooh!

05:57.551 --> 06:01.103

06:01.103 --> 06:03.896
Stop it!

06:03.896 --> 06:05.379
How's that, huh?

06:08.413 --> 06:10.827

06:17.620 --> 06:19.206
- This morning?

06:19.206 --> 06:20.551
Yes, sir.

06:20.551 --> 06:22.517
What would you
like me to tell him?

06:22.517 --> 06:24.862
Tell him I'll call him back.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.448
Okay.

06:26.448 --> 06:28.551
Allan, what's wrong with you?

06:30.620 --> 06:35.172
Ellie...Ellie's dead.

06:35.172 --> 06:37.620
- What?
- Yes, sir.

06:37.620 --> 06:40.689
- Wh--okay, what happened?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.862
- She was shot.
- What?

06:45.862 --> 06:48.793
- Yes.
- How, how?

06:48.793 --> 06:53.206
- They said
it was a stray bullet.

06:53.206 --> 06:58.206
Uh...okay, where are you?

06:58.206 --> 07:00.517
At my apartment, sir.

07:00.517 --> 07:04.241
- Listen, I will stop by
on my way in, you hear me?

07:04.241 --> 07:06.448
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.310
That's my boy.

07:13.310 --> 07:18.344
- Look...
- All right. Aah.

07:22.517 --> 07:25.310
You ready now, girl?

07:25.310 --> 07:29.793
I don't know anything.

07:29.793 --> 07:33.034
- Mm...no,
that is not it, Lilly.

07:33.034 --> 07:35.172
- Okay, okay...
Other than the, um--

07:35.172 --> 07:40.586
- Yeah?
There you go.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.206
- They're on the run.

07:44.137 --> 07:46.931
I already know that.

07:46.931 --> 07:51.551
- And they know that
you killed Diane.

07:51.551 --> 07:53.758
I didn't kill Diane.

07:53.758 --> 07:56.965
- Well, that's what
they believe.

07:56.965 --> 07:58.482
Okay.

07:58.482 --> 08:00.275
- I bet you
hid the mattress, right,

08:00.275 --> 08:03.620
so, um...there's no proof?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.896
- Why did you help get him
into the White House, Lilly?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.758
- Because he, um, he said
he wanted to get more intel on,

08:16.758 --> 08:19.068
um, on what really happened.

08:21.517 --> 08:24.724
How did he get out?

08:24.724 --> 08:26.689
Wait...what?

08:26.689 --> 08:30.103
- He went in,
but he never came out.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.931
I don't know.

08:39.931 --> 08:43.275
So, you never heard from him?

08:43.275 --> 08:46.758
No...I haven't.

08:48.689 --> 08:52.103
Where is he, Lilly?

08:52.103 --> 08:54.724
- Kyle, I don't know.
- You are lying to me, Lilly!

08:54.724 --> 08:57.448
- I don't know, Kyle,
I don't, I swear I don't.

08:57.448 --> 08:59.034
- Oh! Oh, okay--
- I'm not lying, Kyle.

08:59.034 --> 09:00.517
- Okay.
- Kyle, wait, Kyle--

09:00.517 --> 09:01.896
- Sure, yeah.
- You mother--!

09:01.896 --> 09:03.586
- Somebody's going
for a swim, Lilly.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.310
You better start
talking to me, aah.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.344
Ooh, that one almost hit me
in the face.

09:11.241 --> 09:15.275
- You know, it feels good
to suit up again.

09:15.275 --> 09:16.758
Yeah.

09:20.758 --> 09:23.448
- What's up with you?
Why aren't you dressed?

09:23.448 --> 09:25.413
- I still haven't
heard from Lilly.

09:25.413 --> 09:27.379
- Bobby, come on--
- I'm going over there.

09:27.379 --> 09:30.137
- No, no, no, no, no, the car's
gonna be here in 40 minutes.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.310
- That's just enough time
for me to get there, alright,

09:32.310 --> 09:34.827
- I'll meet you on the road.
- No, no, no, not enough time,

09:34.827 --> 09:36.551
you shouldn't do this right now.

09:36.551 --> 09:39.310
- My gut has never
lied to me, Max.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.068
Your gut?

09:42.620 --> 09:45.896
Okay, okay, fine.

09:45.896 --> 09:48.275
Where are you going?

09:48.275 --> 09:50.965
- Yeah, I know, I'm an idiot
for going with you.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.172
We'll tell him
we had a change of plans.

09:57.172 --> 10:01.344
- We going or not?
Kind of on a time crunch!

10:01.344 --> 10:03.517
Okay...let's get it.

10:06.931 --> 10:09.275
After you, Mr. Holmes.

10:22.241 --> 10:23.689
What are you doing?

10:25.379 --> 10:27.689
Go head.

10:27.689 --> 10:30.068
- Oh my god,
what are you talking about?

10:30.068 --> 10:32.931
- No, just go head
and say how stupid I am.

10:32.931 --> 10:34.103
Barry...

10:34.103 --> 10:35.827
- No, she came here
to take the money,

10:35.827 --> 10:38.275
and I let her in here.

10:38.275 --> 10:39.862
Well...

10:42.482 --> 10:44.137
Yeah, I know.

10:47.586 --> 10:49.827
I told you.

10:49.827 --> 10:51.827
Barry, look,
I'm too stressed out

10:51.827 --> 10:54.000
to talk about this right now,
so can we not?

10:58.724 --> 11:01.965
- Sharon,
what happened with you?

11:01.965 --> 11:03.758
- Barry, I told you--
- No, please...tell me.

11:03.758 --> 11:06.206
- Your dad
will handle it, alright?

11:08.482 --> 11:10.413
Okay, fine.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.724
- He say he's gonna
take care of it,

11:19.724 --> 11:21.655
so you don't have to
worry about it.

11:21.655 --> 11:24.758
Yeah, fine.

11:24.758 --> 11:27.172
- All right, look,
I'm gonna go to work.

11:27.172 --> 11:29.448
- You're seriously
going to work?

11:29.448 --> 11:32.517
- Well, you gon' pay my bills
and help my sister, too?

11:32.517 --> 11:34.275
Okay, fine, do you.

11:34.275 --> 11:36.103
- I am.
- All right.

11:36.103 --> 11:38.206
- You sure are doing you.
- Yep.

11:38.206 --> 11:40.965
- Rakudushis and all,
just running through 'em all.

11:40.965 --> 11:43.206
- I know you ain't
about to come at me

11:43.206 --> 11:45.103
with no jealousy shit.

11:45.103 --> 11:46.689
- I'm not coming at you
with anything.

11:46.689 --> 11:50.310
- Okay, good
'cuz I'm not in the mood for it.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.413
Okay, fine.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.103
Whatever.

11:56.896 --> 11:59.000
- She wasn't even
that cute anyway.

12:04.310 --> 12:05.758
Hey, sir.

12:10.551 --> 12:13.068
You okay?

12:13.068 --> 12:16.965
No...not really, sir.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.448
What happened?

12:22.172 --> 12:27.896
- Well...
- Hey, Allan...what happened?

12:27.896 --> 12:30.965
- A bullet came right through
that window...

12:30.965 --> 12:34.965
and hit Ellie right in the head.

12:34.965 --> 12:36.827
Allan, I'm sorry.

12:36.827 --> 12:38.793
- I just...
I don't know what to do,

12:38.793 --> 12:42.379
I can't believe this.

12:42.379 --> 12:44.344
- All right, look,
I got the report from Metro,

12:44.344 --> 12:47.137
they said that it
was a gang shooting.

12:47.137 --> 12:52.172
- No, no, no...I don't believe
that, sir, for one second.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.896
Why not?

12:57.793 --> 13:00.482
Can I trust you, sir?

13:00.482 --> 13:02.379
- Allan, you handle all
of my personal matters,

13:02.379 --> 13:05.379
and you want to know
if you can trust me, seriously?

13:08.068 --> 13:09.586
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

13:09.586 --> 13:10.862
All right, you can tell me.

13:10.862 --> 13:14.689
- I know I can.
- Tell me...hm?

13:14.689 --> 13:16.448
The First Lady, sir.

13:16.448 --> 13:19.655

13:19.655 --> 13:21.448
The First Lady.

13:23.551 --> 13:25.103
What are you saying, Allan?

13:25.103 --> 13:30.965
- She wanted me to beat--
beat Ellie with a bat.

13:30.965 --> 13:33.413
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.172
She sent a man here, okay?

13:36.172 --> 13:41.758
He kicked my ass...
all over this apartment, okay?

13:41.758 --> 13:43.793
And she threatened
to send him back here

13:43.793 --> 13:47.241
every single night, okay,
until I did it.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.241
And he did that to you?

13:52.241 --> 13:55.793
- Yeah, yeah, I got the
bruised ribs to prove it, sir.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.413
Okay.

14:00.344 --> 14:02.448
I think she did it.

14:02.448 --> 14:07.137
- Allan, I'm--I'm really,
really sorry.

14:07.137 --> 14:10.172
- Oh, come on...I don't know
what to do with all this.

14:10.172 --> 14:12.000
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, hold up,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.379
why--why--why--why
would she do all of that?

14:14.379 --> 14:15.724
Oh my goodness,

14:15.724 --> 14:19.655
because Ellie, all right,
was sleeping with the President.

14:19.655 --> 14:22.034
- No, no, no, Allan,
that's not true, it's not true.

14:22.034 --> 14:23.413
- Sir...
- Allan...

14:23.413 --> 14:25.379
- You know it's true.
- It's not true.

14:25.379 --> 14:27.103
- I'm not gonna
say anything, okay?

14:27.103 --> 14:29.241
I'm not, but you have
to level with me, sir.

14:29.241 --> 14:30.827
- Look, Allan,
it's not true, okay?

14:30.827 --> 14:32.448
I know the man,
I work with him,

14:32.448 --> 14:34.655
- he wouldn't do that.
- Oh, come on,

14:34.655 --> 14:36.413
why doesn't anybody believe me?

14:36.413 --> 14:38.896
All right, I saw it
with my own eyes.

14:38.896 --> 14:41.896
- Ellie told me.
- What?

14:41.896 --> 14:43.448
Yeah...she told me,

14:43.448 --> 14:46.448
and she told me that she
wanted to end it with him.

14:46.448 --> 14:48.206
- What?
- Yeah.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.586
She told me, sir.

14:53.586 --> 14:56.482
I think...that the First Lady
had Ellie killed.

14:56.482 --> 14:58.448
- No, no, no, no, Allan,
it was an accident.

14:58.448 --> 15:00.586
- No, right in the head, sir?
- Now you listen to me,

15:00.586 --> 15:02.689
this report right here,
says it was an accident, okay?

15:02.689 --> 15:06.275
You stop talking right now.
It was an accident.

15:09.482 --> 15:10.758
Okay.

15:10.758 --> 15:14.586
- Okay, now you get
yourself together, you hear me?

15:14.586 --> 15:16.448
Yes, sir.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.586
- And I want you
to take the day off.

15:18.586 --> 15:20.034
- Yes, sir.
- Listen,

15:20.034 --> 15:22.241
we'll get a team on this,
they'll call her family,

15:22.241 --> 15:23.896
and we'll get this
thing moving, okay?

15:23.896 --> 15:26.034
Yeah, okay.

15:27.965 --> 15:33.896
- Allan...I'm really
sorry about this.

15:33.896 --> 15:37.655
- Yeah...thank you,
me, too, sir.

15:37.655 --> 15:39.310
Yeah.

15:47.482 --> 15:48.827
It's good.

15:48.827 --> 15:52.931
- Hi.
- Hi. Um...did you sleep?

15:52.931 --> 15:54.379
Barely.

15:56.586 --> 15:58.586
- I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

15:58.586 --> 16:00.000
Okay.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.344
- All right,
but in the meantime,

16:01.344 --> 16:03.931
you can, uh, just stay here.

16:03.931 --> 16:06.448
- Uh, well, I need
to go back to Kareem's.

16:06.448 --> 16:08.275
Why?

16:08.275 --> 16:10.241
- Me and Barry are
not getting along.

16:12.206 --> 16:15.655
- Are you gonna be safe there?
- Yes.

16:15.655 --> 16:18.689
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:18.689 --> 16:20.586
She took the money.

16:20.586 --> 16:21.931
- What?
- Hm?

16:21.931 --> 16:24.034
- The girl that was here
took the money.

16:24.034 --> 16:26.517
- She's in the Rakudushis.
- What?

16:26.517 --> 16:28.827
- I didn't--I didn't know
she was with them.

16:28.827 --> 16:32.517
- Well, how do you know now?
- I told him I recognized her.

16:32.517 --> 16:35.758
- Well--well, maybe she's
taken the money to Ruth.

16:37.482 --> 16:39.275
- Well, you know what,
I hope so.

16:39.275 --> 16:41.344
I mean, I hope
they get out of there.

16:41.344 --> 16:42.620
You think?

16:42.620 --> 16:44.620
- I mean, maybe that's
why she took the money,

16:44.620 --> 16:46.103
she did ask for help.

16:46.103 --> 16:47.448
- Well, I hope
something happens soon,

16:47.448 --> 16:49.034
'cuz Sam
ain't doing nothing, Dad.

16:49.034 --> 16:50.827
- Look, I--I told you he would.

16:50.827 --> 16:52.379
- Yeah, you--you been said that.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.620
I am going to see him at work.

16:55.620 --> 16:57.758
- And I got your lunch
ready for you.

16:57.758 --> 16:59.034
- Thank you.
- Okay.

16:59.034 --> 17:00.862
I'll see y'all later.

17:00.862 --> 17:02.586
- It's on the counter.
- All right.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.310
Uh...

17:13.172 --> 17:14.689
- FEMALE NEWS REPORTER:
We are being told

17:14.689 --> 17:16.517
that it is the acting Press
Secretary for the White House,

17:16.517 --> 17:18.206
- she was shot.
- What's going on?

17:18.206 --> 17:20.517
- Just...listen...
you'll know.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.448
- She was shot
by a stray bullet,

17:22.448 --> 17:24.034
and several gang members
were arrested in connection.

17:24.034 --> 17:25.482
What the hell?

17:25.482 --> 17:27.482
- This is
extremely unfortunate.

17:30.931 --> 17:32.758
What happened to her?

17:32.758 --> 17:36.068
- If you would just listen, hm.
- Tell me!

17:37.758 --> 17:40.068
She's dead.

17:40.068 --> 17:42.241
What?

17:42.241 --> 17:47.103
Stray bullet...poor dear.

17:47.103 --> 17:48.965
What did you do?

17:51.379 --> 17:53.310
I didn't do anything.

17:53.310 --> 17:54.965
This is so reckless

17:54.965 --> 17:56.931
with all the heat
we have on us right now.

17:56.931 --> 17:58.862
I didn't do it.

17:58.862 --> 18:01.206
Are you out of your mind?

18:01.206 --> 18:05.862
- Gosh, and that poor boy,
he loved her so.

18:05.862 --> 18:08.137
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

18:08.137 --> 18:10.068
Yeah, so sad.

18:12.862 --> 18:14.275
Where are you?

18:14.275 --> 18:15.965
- I'm outside
of your room, sir.

18:15.965 --> 18:17.379
Get in here right now!

18:26.689 --> 18:28.310
Sir...

18:30.137 --> 18:31.655
Is that true?

18:31.655 --> 18:33.862
Is she dead?

18:33.862 --> 18:35.551
Yes, sir, she is.

18:37.724 --> 18:40.241
Tell him what happened.

18:40.241 --> 18:43.827
- There was a gang shooting
behind her building, sir.

18:43.827 --> 18:46.000
It's legit.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.655
What?

18:47.655 --> 18:50.482
- Yeah, don't worry,
Metro is all over it.

18:50.482 --> 18:52.689
Yeah, several arrests were made.

18:55.827 --> 18:59.448
- So, now you can stop
blaming me for this shit.

19:04.172 --> 19:07.241
- You're both...
terrible liars.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.137
Sir...

19:16.482 --> 19:20.827
- Is there a reason
why you're still standing here?

19:22.793 --> 19:24.793
Yeah.

19:24.793 --> 19:28.517
You know this shooting
wasn't clean, hm.

19:28.517 --> 19:29.758
What?

19:29.758 --> 19:32.482
- Yeah...
it was rather sloppy,

19:32.482 --> 19:35.689
you know it--it totally makes
a mess between the eyes.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.068
Sniper, hm?

19:40.068 --> 19:42.655
Really?

19:42.655 --> 19:44.689
- Hm.
- Yeah.

19:44.689 --> 19:47.310
You know it's only a matter
of time before they confirm

19:47.310 --> 19:49.034
that the trajectory
of the bullet

19:49.034 --> 19:52.172
doesn't actually
match the weapon.

19:52.172 --> 19:54.655
- Well, who could
have done that?

19:54.655 --> 19:59.034
- Oh, well...I think we both
know the answer to that, ma'am.

20:01.655 --> 20:04.068
Do we, Donald?

20:04.068 --> 20:06.137
Yes, First Lady, we do.

20:08.689 --> 20:11.241
So, you did it.

20:11.241 --> 20:16.793
Oh...no, no, ma'am,

20:16.793 --> 20:18.137
you did it.

20:20.482 --> 20:23.034
But why would I do that?

20:23.034 --> 20:25.379
- Oh, because she was having
some good, wild sex

20:25.379 --> 20:26.896
with your husband.

20:26.896 --> 20:28.517
Ooh .

20:28.517 --> 20:31.068
No, you would have been more
jealous of that than I would.

20:31.068 --> 20:35.172
- Oh trust me about this, ma'am,
you are wrong about that one.

20:35.172 --> 20:37.310
- Girl, why are
you standing here?

20:37.310 --> 20:39.620
Whatever happened,
whoever did it,

20:39.620 --> 20:43.000
we should be celebrating
that bitch's demise.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.172
Now go sashay somewhere else.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.655
Yeesss, honey, yeess!

20:54.827 --> 20:57.689
- Mr. President...
- What are you doing here?

20:57.689 --> 21:00.206
- I need to speak with you
and your wife.

21:00.206 --> 21:01.793
Me and my wife?

21:01.793 --> 21:05.551
- Yes, and the Chief of Staff,
did he not tell you?

21:05.551 --> 21:08.137
- No, but now is really
not a good time.

21:08.137 --> 21:10.931
Sir, we really need to talk.

21:10.931 --> 21:14.000
- What part of,
'now is not a really good time'

21:14.000 --> 21:16.310
did you not understand?

21:16.310 --> 21:18.551
- Yes, sir,
how long shall I wait?

21:20.448 --> 21:22.931
- I don't give a --.

21:22.931 --> 21:24.827
Sir.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.862
- I thought you were going
to wait until I called...hm.

21:33.862 --> 21:36.655
- This is urgent.
- Okay, what is it?

21:36.655 --> 21:38.413
- I need to speak with you,
the President,

21:38.413 --> 21:40.034
and the First Lady.

21:40.034 --> 21:42.448
- Oh, oh, hey, this is--this is
really, really bad timing.

21:42.448 --> 21:44.620
- I understand that--
- Okay.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.896
- But I need it to happen today.
- What is it all about, huh?

21:47.896 --> 21:50.034
- I am the Vice President
of the United States.

21:50.034 --> 21:52.206
- I understand that,
and I am the Chief of Staff

21:52.206 --> 21:53.551
of the United States.

21:53.551 --> 21:55.551
- And I need to talk
to you all at once.

21:55.551 --> 21:57.931
Well, that's not gonna happen.

21:57.931 --> 22:02.827
- Make it happen...
I'm not leaving until it does.

22:02.827 --> 22:04.551
Yes, sir...hm.

22:12.241 --> 22:14.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:14.379 --> 22:17.275
- I need to talk to you.
- What's up?

22:17.275 --> 22:19.206
- Can we talk outside?
- Yeah.

22:27.517 --> 22:31.931
Sam...this is bad.

22:31.931 --> 22:33.862
What is it?

22:33.862 --> 22:36.275
It's about Sharon...

22:36.275 --> 22:38.448
she said that Kyle
kidnapped her,

22:38.448 --> 22:42.137
and brought her back here
for the President.

22:42.137 --> 22:43.586
What?

22:43.586 --> 22:49.000
- Yes...say he offered her money
and an apartment

22:49.000 --> 22:50.862
to be his mistress.

22:50.862 --> 22:53.172
Richard...

22:53.172 --> 22:57.034
- Sam, it's true,
and you know it.

22:57.034 --> 23:00.034
Yeah, I do.

23:00.034 --> 23:01.482
- But I--I wanna know.

23:01.482 --> 23:05.068
- Okay.
This is the end.

23:05.068 --> 23:07.172
What do you mean?

23:07.172 --> 23:10.034
- I can't do anything more,
I've gone all the way up.

23:10.034 --> 23:11.724
He is all the way up.

23:11.724 --> 23:15.517
No...there's no other route.

23:15.517 --> 23:17.620
Sam, this is bad.

23:17.620 --> 23:19.655
You're telling me.

23:21.793 --> 23:26.379
- Is that why you, uh, is that
why you brought Bobby in?

23:26.379 --> 23:28.344
Bobby?

23:28.344 --> 23:31.344
- Yeah, I saw him...
Bobby, yesterday.

23:31.344 --> 23:33.413
Bobby...

23:33.413 --> 23:35.931
Bobby Cayden.

23:35.931 --> 23:38.310
I didn't bring him in.

23:38.310 --> 23:40.965
- Sam, he--he was here.

23:40.965 --> 23:42.551
- You mean here
in the White House?

23:42.551 --> 23:45.103
- Yes.
- What?

23:45.103 --> 23:47.206
Yes, he was in the kitchen.

23:49.137 --> 23:51.862
Oh shit!

23:51.862 --> 23:53.310
What?

23:53.310 --> 23:55.413
Damn!

23:55.413 --> 23:57.793
- Sam, what--what--
what are we gonna do?

23:59.655 --> 24:02.517
- Tell Sharon to call me
if she sees Kyle.

24:02.517 --> 24:04.172
Okay.

24:04.172 --> 24:08.586
- Until then...
I'ma do what I have to do here.

24:08.586 --> 24:11.310
- Okay.
- I'll keep you posted.

24:11.310 --> 24:13.517
Yeah, okay.

24:13.517 --> 24:17.689
- Hey, hey, Richard...
say nothing.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.965
And you say less.

24:30.206 --> 24:33.551
- Hello?
- Hi.

24:33.551 --> 24:35.310
Ma'am...

24:35.310 --> 24:37.413
- I'm so sorry to hear
about your loss.

24:37.413 --> 24:39.931
- You don't give a shit
about my loss.

24:39.931 --> 24:44.586
- You're right, but I've been
trying to work on my sympathy.

24:44.586 --> 24:46.896
What do you want?

24:46.896 --> 24:48.758
- I knew you wouldn't
be able to do it.

24:48.758 --> 24:50.448
- Ma'am, can I--

24:50.448 --> 24:54.448
- No, no, you're a good boy,
and that's cute.

24:54.448 --> 24:57.172
- I have to go, okay?
- Where are you going?

24:57.172 --> 24:58.689
Ma'am...

24:58.689 --> 25:00.896
- Will I see you at
the White House today?

25:00.896 --> 25:04.827
I would love to give you a hug.

25:04.827 --> 25:08.758
I will not be coming in.

25:08.758 --> 25:12.000
- Okay, well I'll
wait for you here.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.413
Did you do it?

25:13.413 --> 25:14.965
Do what?

25:14.965 --> 25:16.448
Shoot her?

25:16.448 --> 25:19.275
How would I do that?

25:19.275 --> 25:20.758
I know you did it.

25:20.758 --> 25:24.448
- No, honey,
it was random gangs.

25:24.448 --> 25:29.724
- No...I know...
that you killed her.

25:29.724 --> 25:32.379
No, baby, don't think that.

25:35.965 --> 25:38.482
Hello?

25:38.482 --> 25:41.275
Hello?

25:41.275 --> 25:45.551
Huh, he hung up,

25:45.551 --> 25:48.000
he must have really
liked that trash.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.413
Cilla.

25:55.413 --> 25:58.310
Richard.

25:58.310 --> 26:00.275
How was your night?

26:00.275 --> 26:03.379
Uneventful...which is good.

26:03.379 --> 26:06.241
- Yes, it is.
- Right.

26:06.241 --> 26:10.448
- Um, look you...
you started breakfast?

26:10.448 --> 26:12.551
Yes, I did.

26:12.551 --> 26:16.758
- Okay, well, um--
- What, Richard?

26:16.758 --> 26:20.896
- Mason...is gonna cook
the breakfast.

26:20.896 --> 26:23.172
Are we really doing this?

26:23.172 --> 26:25.965
Yes, we are.

26:25.965 --> 26:28.862
- Look, if I wanted
to kill that bitch,

26:28.862 --> 26:32.310
she wouldn't eat it.

26:32.310 --> 26:34.310
Well...

26:36.586 --> 26:38.517
the bitch thinks that you are.

26:38.517 --> 26:41.000
Hmm...sorry, ma'am.

26:43.103 --> 26:44.758
I'm so sure.

26:44.758 --> 26:47.896
Richard, we will have breakfast.

26:47.896 --> 26:49.689
Yes, ma'am...right away.

26:49.689 --> 26:51.448
Just me and my son.

26:51.448 --> 26:54.551
Yes, ma'am.

26:54.551 --> 26:57.379
- You keep letting
all those little things

26:57.379 --> 27:00.517
fall out of your
cute little mouth.

27:00.517 --> 27:04.413
- Sorry, ma'am,
won't happen again.

27:04.413 --> 27:07.862
How's my father?

27:09.620 --> 27:11.655
Ma'am...

27:11.655 --> 27:14.896
Did you screw him last night?

27:14.896 --> 27:19.172
- No, ma'am,
you have me mistaken.

27:19.172 --> 27:21.896
- Well, you get your power
from somewhere,

27:21.896 --> 27:24.034
and that seems like
the only thing

27:24.034 --> 27:27.241
that will get you
to have that power.

27:27.241 --> 27:29.379
Okay.

27:29.379 --> 27:31.103
And Richard?

27:31.103 --> 27:32.379
Yes, ma'am?

27:32.379 --> 27:35.931
- After breakfast, tell Sam
I'd like to go for a run.

27:38.103 --> 27:39.655
Just he and I.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.655
Yes, ma'am.

27:44.655 --> 27:46.517
Thank you.

27:55.310 --> 27:58.275
Ooh, Priscilla...

28:00.862 --> 28:04.068
I'm okay.

28:04.068 --> 28:05.724
I'm okay.

28:08.068 --> 28:12.103
- Mm-mm, I don't
have nothing to say,

28:12.103 --> 28:14.310
I'ma--I'ma go
check on my staff.

28:25.896 --> 28:27.827
Like what you see, buddy?

28:27.827 --> 28:30.931
- Sir...you don't
have to make this hard.

28:30.931 --> 28:34.379
- Round the clock
shifts, I see.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.758
Yeah.

28:35.758 --> 28:38.620
Am I really that important?

28:38.620 --> 28:41.413
Yes sir, you are.

28:41.413 --> 28:45.862
- Yeah, sure...
nobody really cares about me.

28:45.862 --> 28:48.068
Yes, they do.

28:48.068 --> 28:52.379
All right...whatever you say.

28:56.551 --> 28:58.448
Where are you going?

28:58.448 --> 29:00.241
Wherever I wanna go.

29:00.241 --> 29:02.344
Jason...

29:02.344 --> 29:05.551
- To breakfast, okay,
is that okay?

29:05.551 --> 29:07.793
Can I just go to breakfast?

29:07.793 --> 29:10.172
Okay, fine.

29:12.517 --> 29:13.931
Let's go.

29:13.931 --> 29:15.620
- Are you gonna
follow me there, too?

29:15.620 --> 29:19.034
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Okay.

29:19.034 --> 29:20.724
- Okay?
- Come on.

29:28.862 --> 29:32.241
Hey, hey...I want breakfast.

29:32.241 --> 29:34.586
- Well, good morning
to you, sir.

29:34.586 --> 29:36.413
I said I want breakfast.

29:36.413 --> 29:39.241
Yes, sir, right away.

29:39.241 --> 29:42.862
- Don't you wanna know
what I want?

29:42.862 --> 29:44.965
You don't want your usual?

29:44.965 --> 29:46.931
No, no, today,

29:46.931 --> 29:49.000
I just need, like,
a--a--a really hard drink;

29:49.000 --> 29:51.965
some--some alcohol.

29:51.965 --> 29:54.551
- I'm sorry, sir,
we can't do that.

29:58.827 --> 30:00.931
- What?
Don't look at him?

30:00.931 --> 30:04.206
I can get you orange juice.

30:04.206 --> 30:07.620
- Okay, yeah, sounds great...
with vodka.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.137
Won't happen.

30:09.137 --> 30:10.931
What good are you people?

30:10.931 --> 30:14.310
- Son...you need to wait
in the dining room,

30:14.310 --> 30:16.586
and we will prepare
your breakfast.

30:18.862 --> 30:23.000
- Hey, you know they sent
my sister away, right?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.379
Yes, I heard that.

30:25.379 --> 30:27.758
- Do you have any idea
where she is?

30:27.758 --> 30:30.448
No, I don't.

30:30.448 --> 30:34.689
- Okay, but if you did,
if you knew anything...

30:34.689 --> 30:37.448
would you tell me?

30:37.448 --> 30:43.413
- Certainly...if you
could tell me one thing.

30:43.413 --> 30:45.000
Yeah, what's that?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.655
What happened to Jean?

30:52.379 --> 30:55.793
Hmm?

30:55.793 --> 30:58.379
Jean is dead.

30:58.379 --> 31:00.896
Is she?

31:00.896 --> 31:04.758
Yeah...I killed her.

31:12.034 --> 31:14.172
Is that so?

31:18.413 --> 31:21.310
- Jason...maybe we should go
to the dining room.

31:21.310 --> 31:23.896
- No, no!
Let him go on, Alonzo.

31:23.896 --> 31:26.103
- Priscilla...
- What did I say?

31:28.931 --> 31:33.068
- Go head, Jason,
you were saying?

31:33.068 --> 31:35.206
I was saying I killed her.

31:37.275 --> 31:38.724
How?

31:41.551 --> 31:44.413
- I raped her
and strangled her to death.

31:47.034 --> 31:49.965
Is that so?

31:49.965 --> 31:53.724
- Yeah, and then I put her body
under my bed.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.275
What happened to her body?

32:01.724 --> 32:04.793
My parents took care of it.

32:04.793 --> 32:08.517
How?

32:08.517 --> 32:10.896
They just did.

32:10.896 --> 32:15.517
They just...
take care of everything.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.827
- What else
have they covered up?

32:18.827 --> 32:23.689
- Wow! You really don't know
how this place works by now.

32:25.551 --> 32:27.103
They cover up everything.

32:30.103 --> 32:32.000
Now, can I have
my breakfast, please?

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
Certainly...without vodka.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.793
Come on, Alonzo.

32:49.827 --> 32:54.965
Oh god, oh god, I can't...

32:54.965 --> 32:58.689
Oh, Jean.

33:08.689 --> 33:10.689
Are you okay?

33:10.689 --> 33:12.344
No!

33:14.172 --> 33:18.068
- Priscilla...
what--what's the matter?

33:18.068 --> 33:21.241
- The little bastard
needs breakfast.

33:21.241 --> 33:24.689
- Okay...okay, look, I'll--
I'll--I'll take care of it.

33:27.034 --> 33:29.827
He just confessed to me.

33:29.827 --> 33:32.310
What?

33:32.310 --> 33:36.758
- That he killed Jean.

33:36.758 --> 33:38.413
- Wh--wh--wh--wait, what?

33:38.413 --> 33:41.137
He just said it to my face.

33:41.137 --> 33:44.413
- Priscilla--Priscilla, no.
- I'm telling you.

33:44.413 --> 33:48.551
- Wait, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute...

33:48.551 --> 33:51.137
what did he say?

33:51.137 --> 33:55.862
- That he did it,
that he killed her.

33:55.862 --> 34:00.724
Okay...how did he say it?

34:00.724 --> 34:02.379
Was he joking?

34:02.379 --> 34:04.551
- He was telling
the truth, Richard.

34:07.965 --> 34:09.379
Damn!

34:09.379 --> 34:12.275
Aargh! See, these people...

34:12.275 --> 34:15.137
they think they
are above the law.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.586
Mm-mm, but see,
we gotta call it in.

34:17.586 --> 34:19.586
- No, no, no, no.
- We gotta call it in.

34:19.586 --> 34:24.068
- No, no, no, Priscilla...
- What?

34:24.068 --> 34:28.206
You took the same oath I did.

34:28.206 --> 34:33.689
- Priscilla, we have been
working with the CIA for years,

34:33.689 --> 34:36.310
and no one knows it.

34:36.310 --> 34:37.862
And of all the presidents,

34:37.862 --> 34:40.896
we can't let these two
break our cover.

34:40.896 --> 34:43.586
We have to tell them for Jean!

34:43.586 --> 34:47.517
- Yes, but we have to be careful
how we tell them.

34:48.896 --> 34:50.344
Richard, I...

34:50.344 --> 34:52.413
- Priscilla...
- I can't even.

34:52.413 --> 34:54.827
- Priscilla, listen,
listen to me, Priscilla,

34:54.827 --> 34:56.793
I never wanted
to work with them.

34:59.413 --> 35:01.758
- All I wanted to do
was be a butler,

35:01.758 --> 35:05.034
I never wanted to
give them information.

35:05.034 --> 35:07.482
- We've never had
any information

35:07.482 --> 35:10.965
to give them until now, come on!

35:13.517 --> 35:17.275
This...doesn't feel right.

35:17.275 --> 35:20.344
This don't feel right?

35:20.344 --> 35:24.655
Richard, we have been
getting paid for years

35:24.655 --> 35:26.586
on the side by them,

35:26.586 --> 35:29.103
this is the very thing they
want us to report,

35:29.103 --> 35:30.551
come on, Richard.

35:30.551 --> 35:36.137
- Priscilla...he has
the House and the Senate...

35:36.137 --> 35:39.793
- the D.O.
- J is in his pocket,

35:39.793 --> 35:41.655
the Attorney General's
doing his bidding.

35:41.655 --> 35:44.172
I know that!

35:44.172 --> 35:46.482
Oh god.

35:46.482 --> 35:50.724
- We have to be careful
who we share this with.

35:50.724 --> 35:53.965
- I hear you, Richard, okay?
- Okay.

35:53.965 --> 35:56.551
- Let me go.
- I hope you do.

35:56.551 --> 35:59.793
I do...I do.

35:59.793 --> 36:05.724
- Okay, okay, Priscilla,
I'll get his meal.

36:05.724 --> 36:11.482
- Oh, yeah, that would
be smart for you to do that.

36:13.965 --> 36:15.482
I knew he did something!

36:15.482 --> 36:17.517
I said it, I knew it.

36:17.517 --> 36:19.896
Priscilla, please, please...

36:23.137 --> 36:24.758
Okay?

36:27.448 --> 36:29.724
- I want to see him,
and I want to see him now!

36:29.724 --> 36:32.793
- Sir, I am telling you,
this may not be the best time.

36:32.793 --> 36:34.206
I don't care.

36:34.206 --> 36:37.172
- Okay.
- And the First Lady.

36:37.172 --> 36:38.724
- Okay, you know what,
I called her,

36:38.724 --> 36:41.034
she's on her way down,
she should be here any second.

36:41.034 --> 36:43.448
- I don't think you understand--
- You know what, let me--

36:43.448 --> 36:45.620
I'll just go into the Oval,
and tell him, okay?

36:45.620 --> 36:47.448
- Fine, yeah,
and I'm coming with you.

36:47.448 --> 36:49.586
- Oh, no, trust me,
you don't wanna do that, okay,

36:49.586 --> 36:51.551
'cuz he's not
in the best of moods.

36:51.551 --> 36:54.275
- He's not in the best of moods,
what's--what's his problem?

36:54.275 --> 36:56.448
I'm the one that's doing
all the cabinet meetings.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.724
- You don't wanna let him hear
you say that...trust me.

36:58.724 --> 37:00.413
- Look, just get it done!
- Yeah, hey, I'm--

37:00.413 --> 37:03.068
- Just get it done! Go!
- I am on your side, okay?

37:03.068 --> 37:04.931
I'm here to manage it
for you, okay?

37:04.931 --> 37:06.206
Trust me, all right, I gotcha.

37:14.758 --> 37:17.620
- Sir...
- You know Victoria did it.

37:17.620 --> 37:21.000
- Did what, sir?
- Ellie...she had her killed.

37:22.689 --> 37:24.448
- Are you sure, sir?
I mean, do you--

37:24.448 --> 37:26.034
Of course I'm sure.

37:26.034 --> 37:27.482
- No, do you--
do you really think

37:27.482 --> 37:31.137
that she would do
something like that?

37:31.137 --> 37:33.827
- Of course I do,
have you met her?

37:33.827 --> 37:35.827
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?

37:35.827 --> 37:37.896
- No, but, your Vice President,
sir, he's--he's--

37:37.896 --> 37:40.413
- Oh, I ran into that moron,
I don't wanna talk to him.

37:40.413 --> 37:41.724
- No, sir, no, sir.
- No.

37:41.724 --> 37:44.206
- He's been--
hear me out, sir.

37:44.206 --> 37:47.379
He's been calling and calling.

37:47.379 --> 37:49.517
I don't care, Donald.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.827
- I understand, sir,
but listen to me, okay?

37:51.827 --> 37:54.206
Sir, he's been taking
all of the cabinet meetings,

37:54.206 --> 37:57.137
and I really think that we need
to hear what he has to say

37:57.137 --> 37:59.068
because he's not going anywhere.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.137
- -- him!
- Sir...

38:01.137 --> 38:02.586
- No, you--
you don't understand,

38:02.586 --> 38:05.310
nobody wants to listen
to that jackass.

38:05.310 --> 38:08.655
I'm the President,
he's corny, he's a mascot.

38:08.655 --> 38:10.586
I mean, yeah,
have you ever seen him

38:10.586 --> 38:12.689
do a--do a--
do a-- do a press conference?

38:12.689 --> 38:15.310
He's like an Abercrombie model.
I mean, it's--it's creepy.

38:15.310 --> 38:17.551
He's that stupid.
He's so dumb, he's creepy,

38:17.551 --> 38:19.517
so, no,
I don't wanna talk to him,

38:19.517 --> 38:21.586
and no one else wants
to talk to him either.

38:21.586 --> 38:23.586
- Sir, I agree
with most of what you just said;

38:23.586 --> 38:25.344
however, he's not
gonna go anywhere, sir,

38:25.344 --> 38:26.896
we need to deal
with this right now.

38:26.896 --> 38:30.068
- Are you telling me...
as President,

38:30.068 --> 38:34.655
you're forcing me
to talk to the Vice President?

38:34.655 --> 38:36.551
- Sir, I would never
force you to do anything

38:36.551 --> 38:37.965
that you didn't wanna do.

38:37.965 --> 38:40.758
So, look, calm down, sir,
here's what I'll do.

38:40.758 --> 38:42.793
I'm gonna give
the First Lady a call,

38:42.793 --> 38:46.344
and I'll have her come down,
we'll deal with it and be done.

38:46.344 --> 38:47.931
- Wait, wh--what
are you calling her for?

38:47.931 --> 38:50.862
- He actually wants
to see you both, sir.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.172
- Maybe he's resigning.
- Let's hope so.

38:53.172 --> 38:54.655
Oh, that'll be fantastic.

38:54.655 --> 38:56.103
- Okay, yeah, just--
- Yeah?

38:56.103 --> 38:58.275
- Dog whistle for Victoria,
she'll come running.

38:58.275 --> 39:01.586
- Gotcha.
- Well, there she is.

39:01.586 --> 39:04.379
- Donald...we need
to talk about Priscilla--

39:04.379 --> 39:06.931
- First Lady...
I was just about to call you.

39:06.931 --> 39:08.793
- Wh--well, Priscilla
needs to go, I mean--

39:08.793 --> 39:10.724
Ssh!

39:10.724 --> 39:13.275
The Vice President
is in the lobby,

39:13.275 --> 39:14.965
and he wants
to talk to you both.

39:14.965 --> 39:16.793
- I saw him.
- Yeah?

39:16.793 --> 39:19.137
- What that corny mother--
wanna talk to us about?

39:19.137 --> 39:21.724
- Ma'am, I don't know,
but he's insisting on it.

39:21.724 --> 39:24.896
- Well, I insist on good sex,
but I'm stuck with this one.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.931
- Yeah, what is all the cloak
and dagger bullshit?

39:26.931 --> 39:28.620
Sir, I'm not sure.

39:28.620 --> 39:30.310
- VICTORIA:
Is that bitch with him?

39:30.310 --> 39:33.931
- Exactly which bitch
is that, ma'am?

39:33.931 --> 39:35.448
His wife.

39:35.448 --> 39:37.344
- No, ma'am,
I'm pretty sure he's alone.

39:37.344 --> 39:38.758
- VICTORIA:
Mm, well in that case,

39:38.758 --> 39:42.551
I might be able to tolerate
him for two minutes.

39:42.551 --> 39:44.172
I'll get him right now.

39:54.275 --> 39:55.689
- You know what
this shit is about?

39:55.689 --> 39:57.379
I'm hoping he's resigning.

39:58.620 --> 40:01.172
Come on in, have a seat.

40:01.172 --> 40:02.758
What do you want?

40:02.758 --> 40:07.482
- Mr. President...
we have a matter to discuss.

40:07.482 --> 40:10.206
- We don't shake hands...
sit down.

40:18.551 --> 40:21.517
- I knew I should have chosen
a woman.

40:21.517 --> 40:24.896
Well, honey, you almost did.

40:24.896 --> 40:27.448
Hi.

40:27.448 --> 40:30.275
But, then you'd
be trying to -- her, too.

40:30.275 --> 40:32.310
Not if she was your age.

40:32.310 --> 40:33.758
- Look, Mr. Vice President--

40:33.758 --> 40:35.206
- This country--
- What is it?

40:35.206 --> 40:37.620
- Would be so screwed
if something happened to me.

40:37.620 --> 40:41.068
- Sir...
- You know...

40:41.068 --> 40:43.655
nobody wants
to hear from you.

40:43.655 --> 40:46.896
Nobody...voted for you.

40:46.896 --> 40:50.413
Why can't you just be quiet,
and enjoy the free ride?

40:50.413 --> 40:52.103
What is it, sir?

40:52.103 --> 40:54.206
- I'm sure
it's something simple, Donald.

40:54.206 --> 40:58.034
I'm sure it's something simple
that should have been handled,

40:58.034 --> 40:59.758
but this one screwed it up.

40:59.758 --> 41:02.931
And then he got scared
and he got confused,

41:02.931 --> 41:04.517
and now he's here.

41:04.517 --> 41:08.068
No balls, this one...no balls.

41:10.965 --> 41:14.965
- You killed Denise Truesdale,
framed two agents,

41:14.965 --> 41:17.517
blew up a van
to get rid of the evidence,

41:17.517 --> 41:19.206
and then you killed
the maid, Jean.

41:19.206 --> 41:21.586
Plus, there's about 57 other
laws that you've broken,

41:21.586 --> 41:23.310
and you haven't
even been in office

41:23.310 --> 41:25.206
for a hundred days yet.

41:25.206 --> 41:28.413
So, I'm here to give you
this opportunity to resign.

41:28.413 --> 41:32.103
Otherwise,
I'm going to the press,

41:32.103 --> 41:35.034
and I will ruin your -- life.

41:38.172 --> 41:39.862
Is that balls enough for you?

41:43.551 --> 41:45.482
- ANNOUNCER:
Next, on "The Oval."

41:45.482 --> 41:47.241
- One thing
that you can not do,

41:47.241 --> 41:48.793
and that is threaten
my children.

41:48.793 --> 41:51.034
- That husband of
yours is a bit of a Boy Scout.

41:51.034 --> 41:52.724
I'm about to go public.

41:52.724 --> 41:55.862
Yeah, I just need a few
good men to stand with me.

41:55.862 --> 41:58.896
- Where's Gail?
- Where you'll be soon.

41:58.896 --> 42:00.241
Please?

42:00.241 --> 42:04.034
- You are way too valuable to me
to let you leave home.

42:04.034 --> 42:06.206
- Kyle?
- Yes, sir.

42:06.206 --> 42:07.586
Make that shit hurt.

42:07.586 --> 42:08.827
- Donald...
- Cool, cool.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.344
- I need you
at the White House.

42:10.344 --> 42:11.689
- Sir, do you not
trust your detail?

42:11.689 --> 42:13.000
- Not after
what I just did.
