WEBVTT

00:02.835 --> 00:04.671
I think we should
get a limo.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.073
A limo?
Yeah.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.307
A big, expensive limo?

00:07.341 --> 00:08.742
That sounds like fun.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.378
And it is our last
homecoming dance,

00:10.410 --> 00:12.413
so maybe we should
make
a big deal of it.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.747
You want to talk fun?
Public bus.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.650
You meet the funnest people.
Back me up here, Oz.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.353
Well, if it's a dollar issue,
we could all take my van.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.655
Van?

00:21.689 --> 00:24.257
The homecoming queen doesn't
go to the dance in a van.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.559
Use your head.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.394
Well, technically, you
haven't been elected yet.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.562
Although you certainly
and without a doubt will be.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.164
Who else likes a limo?

00:31.199 --> 00:32.665
A private limo.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.103
It is pretty cuddlesome.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.671
And if we all
split the cost...

00:38.706 --> 00:40.274
Um... maybe.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.109
I don't know, if I go and
all.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.744
Why wouldn't you go?
You already have your tickets.

00:44.777 --> 00:48.048
I mean, unless you don't
have a da-ay or two...

00:48.082 --> 00:49.250
to think about it.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.851
We should all
think about it.

00:51.884 --> 00:53.186
What's going on here?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.189
Did Scott not ask her
to the homecoming dance yet?

00:55.222 --> 00:57.691
Thanks, Cordelia.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.926
Humiliation's really good
for my color.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.229
Oh, um... well,
no.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.031
I just...

01:04.063 --> 01:06.033
I assumed that you would think
it was corny or something,

01:06.066 --> 01:08.769
but I-I'm in-- I mean, you know,
if you are, if you want
to.

01:08.801 --> 01:11.138
Uh, sure... I do.

01:11.171 --> 01:12.406
You know, if you want to.

01:12.439 --> 01:13.807
Well, I do if
you want to.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.245
The judges
will
accept that as a yes.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.780
Do you want me to get
you another drink?

01:19.813 --> 01:22.150
Um, no, actually.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.718
Uh, I'm a little tired.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.819
I think I'm gonna
call it a night.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.489
But I'm excited
about the dance.

01:29.522 --> 01:30.757
Me, too.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.998
(shivering)

01:45.539 --> 01:46.674
(footsteps)

01:46.706 --> 01:48.209
(gasps)

01:56.616 --> 01:58.485
(gasps)

01:58.519 --> 02:01.289
It's just me.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.722
Here.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.671
How are you feeling?

02:18.705 --> 02:21.942
It hurts...

02:21.974 --> 02:24.677
less.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.713
Good.

02:37.557 --> 02:41.127
I haven't told Giles
and the others

02:41.161 --> 02:43.663
that you're back.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.699
Giles

02:46.734 --> 02:48.769
And I'm not going to.

02:51.070 --> 02:55.575
They wouldn't understand
that you're... better.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.579
A-And I'm gonna keep
helping you get
better.

03:00.580 --> 03:04.183
It's just that
everything's different
now.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.419
I'm a senior.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.223
I'm really working
harder in school.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.259
I'm even thinking
about college.

03:14.026 --> 03:16.430
A-And I'm involved
with someone.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.848
His name is Scott.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.817
He's a nice,
solid guy.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.489
He makes me happy.

03:43.424 --> 03:46.126
And that's what I need.

03:46.158 --> 03:48.161
Someone I can count on.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.066
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.304
You don't?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.875
When did this happen?
Where was I?

04:01.908 --> 04:04.277
Buffy, it's just...

04:04.312 --> 04:07.747
before we were going out,
you-you seemed so...

04:07.781 --> 04:09.949
full of life,
like a force of nature.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.919
Now you just seem distracted
all the time, and...

04:11.951 --> 04:13.320
No, I know
I...

04:13.353 --> 04:15.622
I'm getting better. Honest.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.223
In fact, from here on,

04:17.257 --> 04:20.293
you are gonna see
a drastic distraction reduction.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.231
"Drastic distraction reduction."

04:25.264 --> 04:27.768
Try saying that ten times fast.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.802
I'm really sorry.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.810
*

04:49.956 --> 04:51.959
*

05:18.317 --> 05:20.454
(dialing)

05:20.487 --> 05:22.490
(modem beeping, hissing)

05:38.170 --> 05:41.675
Is that her?

05:41.709 --> 05:44.411
In the nubile flesh,
my friend.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.247
That's the
target.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.487
(wolf howling)

05:54.521 --> 05:56.689
*

06:47.441 --> 06:49.442
WOMAN:
The mayor will see you
now.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.750
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.252
I'm not bothered, Allan.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.790
Well, I-I'm not sure
how serious this is,

07:02.822 --> 07:05.959
but, uh, they were spotted
in town three days
ago.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.595
I've just been informed.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.997
Frederick and
Hans
Gruenstahler--

07:10.029 --> 07:13.000
uh, wanted in Germany
for capital
murder,

07:13.033 --> 07:15.302
terrorism, the bombing
of Flight
1402.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.836
(sniffing)

07:16.870 --> 07:19.005
I should have brought it
to your attention sooner,

07:19.038 --> 07:21.374
but I-I wanted to confirm...

07:23.375 --> 07:25.778
Would you show me
your hands, please?

07:25.812 --> 07:27.615
Sir?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.649
Your hands.

07:37.490 --> 07:40.293
(inhales)
I think they could be
cleaner.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.495
Of course, sir.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.497
I mean, I-I washed them, but...

07:45.499 --> 07:47.867
After every meal
and under your fingernails.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.336
Dirt gets trapped there.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.805
And germs and mayonnaise.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.540
My dear mother said,

07:53.574 --> 07:56.375
"Cleanliness is next to
godliness," and I believed her.

07:56.408 --> 07:58.310
She never caught a cold.
(laughs)

07:59.579 --> 08:01.814
I'd like these
two
to be put under surveillance,

08:01.848 --> 08:03.016
and I'd like to know

08:03.050 --> 08:07.053
if any other colorful characters
have come to
town.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.487
I'll take care of it.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.223
You have all my faith.

08:16.863 --> 08:19.231
*

08:20.834 --> 08:22.201
(camera clicking)

08:33.113 --> 08:35.014
You have to help
me
pick an
outfit.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.085
I want to wear something
that makes Oz go,
"Oh."

08:38.118 --> 08:40.352
No problem.
I got the tux going on.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.855
I'm gonna look hot
if it even remotely fits.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.924
Whatcha doin'?

08:44.957 --> 08:49.062
Checking out the-- I laughingly
use the phrase-- competition.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.865
Holly Charleston--
nice girl, brain-dead,

08:51.899 --> 08:53.066
doesn't have a prayer.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.201
Michelle Blake--
open to all mankind,

08:55.235 --> 08:58.838
especially those with
a
letterman's jacket and a car.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.941
She could give me a run.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.409
Where's Buffy? She's gonna
miss the yearbook
pictures.

09:03.442 --> 09:06.446
Buffy and Faith are in the
library getting all
sweaty.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.914
They're training.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.115
I stand by my phrase.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.549
OZ: I don't think
she was here

09:10.583 --> 09:11.585
the day they announced them.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.285
Did anybody tell her?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.788
Oh, I'll tell her now.
I have to go

09:14.822 --> 09:16.255
to the nurse's office
for an ice pack anyway.

09:16.288 --> 09:17.591
Did you hurt yourself?

09:17.625 --> 09:19.793
No, silly.
It shrinks the pores.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.730
(grunting)

09:25.932 --> 09:27.433
Ah, man!

09:27.466 --> 09:29.602
Guys should break up
with you more often.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.471
Gee. Thank you.
No, I mean it.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.774
I mean, you really got
some quality rage going.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.743
Really gives you an edge.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.476
Edge-girl.

09:37.509 --> 09:39.412
Just what I always
wanted to be.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.213
Well, screw him,
all right?

09:41.248 --> 09:44.751
You move on, and you party
heavily, and you'll be fine.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.253
I mean, you're still going
to that dance, right?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.788
Maybe.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.489
You got the tix already.
Why don't we go together?

09:49.522 --> 09:51.323
I don't know about that.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.591
Come on.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.126
We'll find
a couple
studs,

09:54.161 --> 09:55.895
we'll use them
and discard them.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.330
That's always fun.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.966
Okay, I'm in.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.567
Not the stud-using part though.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.770
Or probably not.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.976
Uh, Bobby, Mashad.
(chuckles)

10:10.009 --> 10:12.745
You don't phone,
you don't write.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.148
Where's the love?

10:22.655 --> 10:24.524
Miss Moran? Hi.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.359
I'm so glad
that I ran into you.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.261
Um, I had this
little incident last year

10:29.296 --> 10:31.597
of getting
kicked out of school.

10:31.630 --> 10:32.799
And I'm back now though.

10:32.832 --> 10:35.001
I've done all of
my makeup tests.

10:35.034 --> 10:38.004
But I still need one written
recommendation from a teacher--

10:38.038 --> 10:41.374
I think the word that Principal
Snyder used was "glowing"--

10:41.408 --> 10:44.543
uh, to put in my file, so I can
prove that I belong here.

10:44.576 --> 10:47.213
Mm-hmm
And, um, you are?

10:47.246 --> 10:49.282
Buffy.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.784
B-Buffy Summers.
Third row.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.352
I sat by the window.

10:53.385 --> 10:55.221
Uh, your class--
Contemporary American Heroes

10:55.254 --> 10:57.825
from Amelia Earhart
to Maya Angelou.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.027
The class
that changed my life.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.196
Were you
absent
a lot, um...?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.097
Buffy.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.072
Hi. I hope you'll consider me
for Homecoming Queen.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.543
I can't believe it.

11:16.576 --> 11:20.047
My favorite teacher, and she
didn't even remember who I was.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.981
I'm like a nonperson.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.884
Am I invisible?
Can you see me?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.053
Big as life.

11:27.086 --> 11:30.657
At Hemery, I was Prom Princess,
I was Fiesta Queen,

11:30.690 --> 11:32.860
I was on
the cheerleading squad.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.895
And the yearbook was, like,
a story of me.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.730
Now it's senior year,
and I'm going to be

11:37.764 --> 11:41.268
one crappy picture on
one-eighth of one crappy
page.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.669
Uh, no, actually,
you're
not.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.572
What do you mean?

11:45.605 --> 11:48.240
Well, you, uh, missed
the picture
taking.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.942
When? Why?

11:49.976 --> 11:51.677
OZ:
We did them yesterday.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.580
WILLOW:
Didn't Cordelia tell you?

11:55.581 --> 11:57.951
Thanks for your support.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.886
Buffy, you look so
cute
in that
outfit.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.520
I'm not voting for you.

12:01.553 --> 12:03.056
Then make it snappy.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.390
How come you didn't tell me

12:04.423 --> 12:05.725
they were doing
the yearbook pictures?

12:05.759 --> 12:07.293
Didn't I? Oh, I guess I forgot.

12:07.326 --> 12:08.861
What's the big?

12:08.895 --> 12:11.798
It's just... you could've
thought about somebody else

12:11.831 --> 12:13.533
for 30 seconds, that's all.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.869
Hey, I am under
a lot of pressure here.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.538
Oh, yeah, campaigning.
Rough gig.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.273
What would you know about it?

12:20.307 --> 12:22.475
Just because you were Guacamole
Queen when you were three

12:22.509 --> 12:24.711
doesn't mean you understand
how this works.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.215
Obviously, it involves
handing
out entirely lame flyers.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.582
No. It involves
being part of this school

12:30.616 --> 12:32.351
and having actual friends.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.322
Now, if it was about
monsters, blood and innards,

12:36.355 --> 12:38.591
then you'd be a shoo-in.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.793
Like to see you
try to win the crown.

12:40.827 --> 12:43.495
You would?

12:43.529 --> 12:45.631
(sighs

12:45.664 --> 12:47.900
Then you will.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.937
What does that mean?

12:49.970 --> 12:53.139
I'm gonna show
you
how it's done.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.842
I'm gonna run for Homecoming
Queen, and I'm going to win.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.278
This is starting to be sad.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.780
Sorry, Cordy, but you have
no idea who you're messing with.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.582
What? The Slayer?

13:03.615 --> 13:06.086
I'm not talking
about the Slayer.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.921
I'm talking about Buffy.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.389
You've awakened
the prom queen within.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.760
And that crown
is going to be mine.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.830
MAN:
 Competition.

13:16.864 --> 13:21.033
Competition is
a beautiful
thing.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.701
It makes us strive.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.972
It makes us accomplish.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.673
Occasionally,
it makes us kill.

13:27.706 --> 13:31.010
We all
have
the desire to win,

13:31.043 --> 13:32.611
whether we're human,

13:32.644 --> 13:35.215
vampire...

13:37.216 --> 13:39.351
...and whatever the hell
you are, my brother.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.553
You got them
spiny-looking head things.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.890
I ain't never
seen that before.

13:43.923 --> 13:47.527
I am Kulak
of the Miquot Clan.

13:47.559 --> 13:49.129
Isn't that nice?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.562
Point is, you're all here

13:50.596 --> 13:53.165
for the same reason.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.302
Well, it sure ain't no
philosophy class now, is it?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.504
Mr. Gorch,
my account statement says

13:58.538 --> 14:00.840
that your deposit
has not yet been made.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.841
Me and Candy?

14:02.875 --> 14:05.946
We blown our whole honeymoon
stash on this little game
here.

14:08.780 --> 14:09.682
They're dirty.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.618
They're
nonconsecutive.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.490
The games will begin
in a few days' time.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.493
The first target--
Buffy-- you've all seen.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.563
The second-- Faith--
is a little more elusive.

14:24.596 --> 14:27.866
But they will both be
together
and ready for the killing,

14:27.900 --> 14:30.537
and that is
a money-back guarantee.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.908
Ladies,
gentlemen,

14:34.942 --> 14:37.710
spiny-headed
looking
creatures,

14:37.744 --> 14:42.815
welcome to Slayerfest '98.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.759
What do you think of this?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.230
Nice.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.033
It's my first big dance,
you know?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.568
Where there's a boy and a band,

15:02.601 --> 15:04.803
and not just me alone in my room

15:04.836 --> 15:07.106
pretending that there's
a boy and a band.

15:07.139 --> 15:08.541
I just want it to be...

15:08.575 --> 15:09.775
Yeah, special.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.778
That's why I
spared
no expense on the tux.

15:12.812 --> 15:16.216
The tux? I thought you borrowed
it from your cousin Rigby.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.284
Expense to my pride, Wil.

15:18.317 --> 15:21.488
They're our only relations
with money, and they shun us.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.490
As they
should.

15:25.491 --> 15:28.260
What do you think about this?

15:29.761 --> 15:31.298
Nice.

15:37.769 --> 15:39.239
What?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.740
I was just...

15:41.774 --> 15:44.144
Remember the
eighth-grade cotillion?

15:44.177 --> 15:46.245
You had that clip-on.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.648
Yeah, I was pretty
styling with the clip-on.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.918
And now here we are,
and it's Homecoming.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.919
Yeah, we
should
face it, Wil.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.123
You and I are gonna be
in neighboring rest homes

15:56.155 --> 15:58.825
while I come over so
you can adjust my, um...

15:58.857 --> 16:00.927
my, uh...

16:00.960 --> 16:04.130
Well, I can't think of
anything
that's not really gross, so...

16:07.000 --> 16:07.966
So, uh...

16:08.000 --> 16:10.537
you and Oz.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.672
How do I put
this?

16:12.705 --> 16:16.208
Are we on first,
second or, uh...

16:16.243 --> 16:17.876
"Ye gods"?

16:17.909 --> 16:20.947
That's none of your business,
Alexander Harris.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.981
Ooh, rounding second.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.184
(scoffs) You don't know that.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.153
What about you and Cordelia?

16:27.187 --> 16:30.657
Oh, a gentleman never
talks about his conquests.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.993
Oh, yeah? Well, since when
did you become a...

16:36.895 --> 16:39.566
...gentleman? (chuckles)

16:39.599 --> 16:41.234
I-I know.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.534
"Nice."

16:44.003 --> 16:47.206
I was gonna go with "gorgeous."

16:47.240 --> 16:49.308
Really?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.009
You, too.

16:51.043 --> 16:53.046
In-in a guy way.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.948
Oz is very lucky.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.086
So is Cordelia.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.121
In-in a girl way.

17:03.722 --> 17:06.192
I don't know
if I can dance in this.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.228
I don't know if I can dance.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.329
Come on. Piece of cake.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.530
Here.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.567
Well, that
seems to,
um...

17:19.439 --> 17:21.107
Yeah.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.843
This shouldn't
be a problem.

17:23.875 --> 17:27.180
No.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.416
No problem.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.451
*

17:44.931 --> 17:46.365
That didn't just happen.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.067
No. I mean, it did,
but it didn't.

17:49.102 --> 17:52.271
Because I respect you, and
Oz,
and I would never...

17:52.305 --> 17:53.640
I would never, either.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.075
It must be the clothes.
It's a fluke.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.609
It's a clothes fluke,
that's what it
is.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.978
And there'll be no more fluking.

17:59.010 --> 18:00.146
Not ever.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.048
We got to get out
of these clothes.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.550
Right now.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.551
Oh, I didn't mean...

18:05.585 --> 18:06.885
I didn't-- Me, either.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.654
BUFFY:
 A campaign is like a war.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.757
It's won or lost
 in the trenches.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.726
Holly, Michelle, and our real
competition, Cordelia,

18:13.759 --> 18:15.295
all have big head starts.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.163
Speaking of big heads,

18:17.196 --> 18:20.267
if I had a watermelon as big
as Cordelia's, I'd be
rich.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.836
Waits for laugh.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.905
Okay, you're right.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.808
Making fun of the competition
only makes me seem petty.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.111
Now, this is just like
any other popularity contest.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.180
I've done this before.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.480
The only
difference

18:34.513 --> 18:37.250
being, this time,
I'm not actually popular.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.618
Although, I'm not
exactly
unpopular.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.288
A lot of people came
to my "welcome home" party.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.855
But they were killed
by zombies.

18:43.890 --> 18:44.856
Good point.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.259
Okay, here's the plan.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.359
Willow,

18:47.394 --> 18:48.861
I need you to
make a database.

18:48.894 --> 18:49.961
See who's for us,

18:49.996 --> 18:50.962
who's on the fence,

18:50.997 --> 18:52.964
and where our
real
crisis areas are.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.334
Oz, you take the fringe--

18:54.366 --> 18:55.801
musicians,

18:55.835 --> 18:57.703
those not
normally
inclined to vote.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.971
Xander,
what...

19:00.006 --> 19:01.441
Uh, Cordelia.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.674
Okay,
look.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.611
I know this is
a little awkward,

19:04.644 --> 19:07.012
but I don't see any reason
why we all can't get along

19:07.046 --> 19:09.015
during
this
campaign time.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.682
I mean, we're...

19:10.717 --> 19:14.653
almost friends, and we are
all riding together in the limo.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.823
Yeah, great.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.458
Willow, how's that
database coming?

19:18.490 --> 19:21.894
Uh, it's... just about done.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.230
Xander?

19:23.262 --> 19:25.865
I got your new flyers.

19:25.897 --> 19:27.334
Let's get cracking.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.005
She's my girlfriend.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.611
It's just that she needs it
so much more than you do.

19:40.413 --> 19:44.049
As Willow goes,
so goes my nation.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.884
Thanks for what you said, Buffy.

19:45.917 --> 19:48.019
I think we're getting along
great. Don't you?

20:02.067 --> 20:06.005
Seems like a lot of fuss
for one little title.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.108
Well, you know, it's no
fun
if you don't try your
best.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.878
As long as fun
is still in the mix.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.413
Sure.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.416
It's not like anyone takes it
that seriously.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.055
*

20:28.560 --> 20:32.865
* Well, I don't
wanna be president *

20:32.898 --> 20:36.635
* Superman or Clark Kent

20:36.669 --> 20:40.873
* I don't wanna walk round
in their shoes *

20:40.906 --> 20:43.875
(both laughing)

20:43.910 --> 20:47.980
* Cause I don't know
whose side I'm on *

20:48.013 --> 20:51.817
* I don't know
my right from wrong *

20:51.851 --> 20:55.086
* I don't know where
I'm going to... *

20:55.121 --> 20:56.588
(grunting)

20:56.623 --> 20:57.656
Hyah!

20:59.991 --> 21:01.827
* I don't know

21:01.861 --> 21:03.762
* About you

21:03.796 --> 21:04.797
(shouts)

21:06.365 --> 21:10.001
* I'll be the rain

21:10.036 --> 21:11.237
* Falling on
your fire escape... *

21:11.269 --> 21:14.140
Oh! Sorry.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.442
Here.

21:15.474 --> 21:18.109
* I may not be the man
you want me to... *

21:18.144 --> 21:19.511
I heard you were doing this.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.146
Uh, yeah.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.650
It's just something
to pass the time.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.084
It's silly, really.

21:25.116 --> 21:27.319
I don't think so.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.955
And for what it's worth,
you have my vote.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.124
No, I don't want you to
feel--

21:32.157 --> 21:33.425
Thank you.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.996
* I don't wanna make you mad
*

21:37.028 --> 21:40.633
* I don't wanna meet your dad

21:41.901 --> 21:45.471
* I don't wanna
be
your dream come true *

21:45.505 --> 21:48.875
*

21:48.907 --> 21:53.011
* Cause I don't know
just what I've found *

21:53.045 --> 21:56.949
* I don't know
my sky from ground *

21:56.982 --> 22:01.319
* I don't know where
I'm going to *

22:04.490 --> 22:07.026
* I don't know

22:07.058 --> 22:09.327
* About you.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.539
Hey.
Hi.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.375
How are you? You good?
You look good.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.643
Anything new?

22:23.675 --> 22:25.211
Hey, did I mention
you look good?

22:25.243 --> 22:27.880
Willow, it's okay
that you're helping Cordelia.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.481
We're best friends.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.182
I'm not gonna
hold it against you.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.919
No, I'm not a friend.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.086
I'm a rabid dog
who should be shot.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.722
But there are forces
at work here--

22:36.756 --> 22:39.392
dark, incomprehensible
forces.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.859
And I'm sure
they're more important

22:40.893 --> 22:43.095
than all we've been through
together,

22:43.128 --> 22:46.699
or... the number of times
that I've saved your life.

22:46.732 --> 22:48.867
What do you want?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.036
15 minutes alone
on your computer

22:50.068 --> 22:51.237
with Cordelia's database.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.338
Okay.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.673
Good. Oh.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.742
So I spoke to the limo
people, and we're all set.

22:56.776 --> 23:01.047
They'll pick up Faith, then me,
then swing by and get you guys.

23:01.079 --> 23:04.717
Now, what's your database
tell you about my weaknesses?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.957
You know,
Jonathan,

23:10.990 --> 23:14.560
I've always felt a special
bond between you and me.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.796
Cordelia gave me
six bucks.

23:16.828 --> 23:19.932
That buys a whole lot
of cupcakes.

23:19.965 --> 23:21.267
Are you kidding?

23:21.299 --> 23:24.936
I've been doing the Vulcan
death grip since I was four.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.939
So you really are
giving out money, huh?

23:26.972 --> 23:29.107
Is that any more tacky
than your faux

23:29.141 --> 23:32.377
"I'm shy but
deep"
campaign posters?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.945
Yes

23:33.980 --> 23:37.249
This whole trying to be like me
really isn't funny anymore.

23:37.282 --> 23:41.453
I was never trying to be
like you, and when was it funny?

23:41.488 --> 23:42.922
I don't see
why your pathetic need

23:42.954 --> 23:44.323
to recapture your glory days

23:44.355 --> 23:46.593
gives you the right
to splinter my vote.

23:46.625 --> 23:49.761
How can you think it's okay
to talk to people like this?

23:49.796 --> 23:51.262
Do you have parents?

23:51.297 --> 23:53.665
Yeah. Two of
them,
unlike some people.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.804
Your brain isn't even connected
to your mouth, is it?

23:57.836 --> 24:00.972
Why don't you do us both a favor
and stay out of my way.

24:01.007 --> 24:04.477
Don't... ever...
do that again.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.345
You're sick, you know that?

24:06.377 --> 24:08.247
Okay, let's not say something
we'll regret later, okay?

24:08.279 --> 24:10.281
You crazy freak!
Vapid
whore!

24:10.316 --> 24:11.282
Like that.

24:11.317 --> 24:12.417
CORDELIA:
What did you call me?

24:12.451 --> 24:15.153
This is just...

24:15.186 --> 24:17.690
...the worst thing
that's ever happened.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.191
Ever.

24:19.224 --> 24:20.960
I know. I
know.

24:20.992 --> 24:22.694
It's just...

24:22.729 --> 24:24.462
when I look at you
now,

24:24.497 --> 24:26.699
it's like I'm seeing you
for the first time.

24:26.732 --> 24:29.468
I'm talking about
Buffy and Cordelia.

24:29.501 --> 24:30.502
Me, too.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.638
What are we gonna do?

24:32.672 --> 24:34.472
I mean, we have to do something.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.208
This is all our fault.

24:36.241 --> 24:38.711
How do you get from chick fight
to our fault?

24:38.744 --> 24:41.647
Because we felt so guilty
about the fluke,

24:41.681 --> 24:44.049
we
overcompensated
helping Cordelia,

24:44.083 --> 24:46.818
and we spun the whole
group dynamic out of orbit.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.655
And we're just a big meteor
shower heading for Earth...

24:49.689 --> 24:50.957
Okay, calm down.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.960
Let's just put our heads
together and think of something.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.328
Okay, now, one of us here is
pretty darn smart, and I'm...

24:59.365 --> 25:00.866
...just in hell.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.569
I mean, I-I thought
being a senior, at last,

25:03.603 --> 25:07.673
and having a girlfriend,
at last, would be a good thing.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.542
Why wouldn't that be
a good thing?

25:10.576 --> 25:12.811
What?

25:12.845 --> 25:15.480
Sometimes when you're
falling to
pieces,

25:15.513 --> 25:18.517
your mouth-- it just does
the sweetest thing.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.824
What are we gonna do?

25:24.856 --> 25:27.660
We just have to get
the two of them
communicating.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.195
I'm talking about us.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.866
*

25:50.717 --> 25:52.852
What's going on here?

25:52.884 --> 25:54.486
Where's Faith?

25:59.290 --> 26:00.859
"Dear Cordelia and Buffy,

26:00.893 --> 26:02.795
"we won't be riding
to the dance with you.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.563
"We want you to work out
your problems,

26:04.596 --> 26:06.365
"because our friendships
are more important

26:06.397 --> 26:08.267
"than who wins
Homecoming Queen.

26:08.299 --> 26:09.935
"Your friends.

26:09.969 --> 26:13.338
P.S. The limo was not cheap.
Work it out."

26:16.442 --> 26:18.243
(sighs) Well...

26:20.813 --> 26:22.781
They bought us corsages?

26:22.815 --> 26:25.951
I took the orchid.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.787
Okay.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.821
(engine starts)

26:42.300 --> 26:44.903
CORDELIA:
 I don't see what
 the big deal is.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.573
I'm not making a big deal.

26:47.605 --> 26:50.809
You wanted the orchid,
you got the orchid.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.578
It goes with
my
complexion better.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.048
It does have that sallow tint.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.451
Finally, we're here.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.054
(car door closes)

27:10.863 --> 27:12.999
What is this?

27:13.031 --> 27:16.836
Okay guys, we've had
enough
of your stupid little games.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.871
What's massively wrong
with this
picture?

27:27.246 --> 27:30.982
Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Slayerfest '98.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.451
What is a Slayerfest, you
ask?

27:33.484 --> 27:34.953
Well, as in most of life,

27:34.987 --> 27:38.023
there's the hunters
and the hunted.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.960
Can you guess
where you two fall?

27:40.992 --> 27:42.627
From the beginning of this tape,

27:42.661 --> 27:44.830
you have exactly 30 seconds--

27:44.864 --> 27:47.665
no, that's 17, now--

27:47.700 --> 27:50.836
to run for your lives.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.505
Faith, Buffy...

27:53.538 --> 27:56.541
have a nice
death.

27:56.575 --> 27:59.211
*

27:59.244 --> 28:03.048
Hello-- how stupid
are you people?

28:03.082 --> 28:04.851
She's a slayer.
I'm a homecoming queen.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.085
(gunshot)

28:06.117 --> 28:07.353
(Cordelia yelps)

28:18.596 --> 28:21.867
* She flies from
a blinding light *

28:21.901 --> 28:25.837
* And spirals
to my heart *

28:25.872 --> 28:27.573
* I try to find

28:27.605 --> 28:30.910
What are you two
so mopey about?

28:30.942 --> 28:32.845
No, we're not mopey.
We're
groovin'.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.712
On Oz's band.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.615
He's a great guy, Oz.

28:36.647 --> 28:39.617
He wrote this song for me.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.624
Sleazebag.

28:45.656 --> 28:47.692
(scoffs)

28:47.726 --> 28:49.528
We have to find Buffy.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.096
Something terrible's
happened.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.465
Just kidding.
Thought I'd give you a scare.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.501
Are those finger sandwiches?

29:07.413 --> 29:09.781
I have an idea: we
talk to these people,

29:09.816 --> 29:12.951
we explain that I'm not a
slayer and they let me go.

29:12.984 --> 29:14.252
Look out!

29:16.654 --> 29:17.689
Get down!

29:21.126 --> 29:22.994
Aah!

29:26.097 --> 29:27.598
That's got to smart.

29:27.633 --> 29:28.835
Now, I can
let you out of that

29:28.867 --> 29:30.269
or I can
put a bullet in your head.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.003
How many are there
in this little game

29:32.038 --> 29:33.372
and what are they packing?

29:34.941 --> 29:39.244
There's me,
two Germans with AR-15s

29:39.278 --> 29:41.646
and grenade launcher.
(grunts)
Yellow-skinned demon

29:41.680 --> 29:43.281
with long knives.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.852
Vampire couple from Texas
named Gorch.

29:45.884 --> 29:47.286
That everybody?

29:47.318 --> 29:49.488
Everybody who's out here.
Germans are
wired.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.623
Their boss is tracking
them on computer.

29:51.656 --> 29:53.525
Now get me out of this.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.294
Could I just ask you
an eensy favor?

29:55.326 --> 29:57.997
Could you just tell your
friends that I'm not a...

29:58.029 --> 29:59.298
(shrieks)

30:04.336 --> 30:06.672
Scott? There you are, honey.

30:06.704 --> 30:08.339
Hey, good news.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.209
The doctor says that
the itching and the swelling

30:10.241 --> 30:11.643
and the burning should clear up,

30:11.676 --> 30:13.679
but we got to
keep
using the ointment.

30:13.711 --> 30:15.181
Hi.

30:23.721 --> 30:26.525
I suspect the, uh,
finger food
contains...

30:26.557 --> 30:28.826
actual
fingers.

30:28.861 --> 30:32.198
I-I think I'll retreat to the
library until the coronation.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.633
I want to be here when Buffy...

30:34.665 --> 30:37.869
Well, uh, however the thing
turns out for
her.

30:37.903 --> 30:40.739
A-And that was a very
fine thing you two
did,

30:40.771 --> 30:44.109
putting Buffy and
Cordelia together.

30:48.413 --> 30:51.884
We did one fine thing.

30:51.917 --> 30:54.220
Yeah. They've been gone
for a while.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.188
They must really be
getting into it.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.595
We should be safe
in here for a while.

31:03.628 --> 31:06.198
You need
to find a weapon.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.901
Safe? I'm not
safe.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.269
I'm gonna die.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.376
Yeah, you are
if you just stand there.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.380
I'm never gonna be crowned
homecoming queen.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.615
I'm never gonna
graduate from high school.

31:23.648 --> 31:26.884
I'm never gonna know if it's
real between me and Xander

31:26.919 --> 31:29.555
or if it's
just...
some temporary insanity

31:29.587 --> 31:31.557
that made me think...

31:31.589 --> 31:33.759
I loved him.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.126
And now I'm never

31:35.161 --> 31:38.430
gonna get the chance
to tell him.

31:38.463 --> 31:40.398
Yes, you are.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.300
We are gonna get out of here
and we are gonna head back

31:42.334 --> 31:44.103
to the library, where Giles
and
the rest of the weapons live.

31:44.135 --> 31:46.538
Then I'm gonna take
out
the rest of these guys

31:46.572 --> 31:48.640
just in time for you
to congratulate me

31:48.673 --> 31:52.144
on my sweeping victory
as homecoming queen.

31:52.177 --> 31:54.113
I know
what you're up to.

31:54.145 --> 31:58.084
You think if you get me mad
enough I won't be so scared.

31:58.116 --> 32:01.586
And, hey... it's working.

32:01.619 --> 32:03.321
Where's a damn weapon?

32:06.758 --> 32:09.228
You really
love Xander?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.730
Well, he kind of
grows on you, like...

32:11.762 --> 32:13.132
a Chia Pet.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.801
That's it?

32:16.835 --> 32:19.305
Just this and a telephone.

32:19.337 --> 32:21.140
A telephone?

32:21.173 --> 32:23.442
And you didn't think
that'd be
helpful?

32:23.474 --> 32:26.244
No, this is better for...

32:26.278 --> 32:27.679
Oh.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.984
You're about to see
why Daniel Boone

32:33.019 --> 32:35.921
and that idiot demon are
creatures of the past.

32:35.953 --> 32:38.023
And why I am the future.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.058
I'm picking up a signal.

32:41.692 --> 32:43.662
They've got a phone!

32:43.694 --> 32:45.096
If you get this message,
Giles,

32:45.131 --> 32:47.298
get help and get out here...
(click)

32:47.333 --> 32:48.700
Hello

32:48.733 --> 32:50.501
What
happened?

32:50.536 --> 32:52.637
It went dead.

32:53.338 --> 32:57.042
(grunting)

32:57.076 --> 32:59.845
Want me to cut
that leg off?

32:59.877 --> 33:01.380
No, thanks.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.220
OLD MAN (on comms):
Continue proceeding south

33:08.253 --> 33:10.922
90 meters to vector three.

33:18.596 --> 33:20.298
(button clicks)

33:20.332 --> 33:22.867
BUFFY:
Giles, it's me... and Cordelia.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.536
We're in a cabin
in Miller's Woods

33:24.569 --> 33:26.704
and we're in big trouble.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.875
Why is it every time
I go somewhere with you,

33:30.909 --> 33:33.545
it always ends
in violence and terror?

33:33.578 --> 33:35.547
Welcome to my life.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.517
I don't want to be in your life.
I want to be in my life.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.920
Well, there's the
door.

33:41.952 --> 33:45.423
Please feel free to walk out
at any time and live your life.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.193
All I wanted was
to be homecoming queen.

33:48.227 --> 33:52.163
And that's all I wanted,
too, Cordelia.

33:52.198 --> 33:56.102
I spent a year's allowance
on this dress.

33:56.134 --> 33:58.769
I don't even get why you care
about homecoming

33:58.804 --> 34:00.605
when you're doing stuff
like this.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.576
Because this is all I do.

34:04.609 --> 34:07.712
This is what my life is.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.952
You couldn't understand.

34:17.155 --> 34:21.427
I just thought...
homecoming queen.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.594
I could pick
up
a yearbook someday

34:23.628 --> 34:26.197
and say, "I was there."

34:26.231 --> 34:27.931
I went to high school.

34:27.965 --> 34:31.036
I had friends
and,
for one moment,

34:31.068 --> 34:34.472
I got to live in the world.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.342
And
there'd
be proof.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.480
Proof that I was chosen

34:41.512 --> 34:43.414
for something other than
this.

34:46.985 --> 34:49.155
Besides...

34:49.188 --> 34:51.422
I look cute in a tiara.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.489
(grunting, growling in distance)

34:52.523 --> 34:53.692
Do you hear...

35:06.003 --> 35:07.105
Cor, the gun.

35:07.139 --> 35:08.440
(grunting)

35:15.614 --> 35:17.081
(gunshot)

35:17.114 --> 35:20.219
Cordelia, the spatula.

35:22.853 --> 35:24.690
Prepare to
launch.

35:24.722 --> 35:26.023
(grunting)

35:30.329 --> 35:33.498
Target's in
range.
Ready your
weapon.

35:33.532 --> 35:37.101
Y-axis 53 degrees west
by eight degrees south.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.836
Buffy!

35:39.505 --> 35:40.306
(growling)

35:40.338 --> 35:41.539
(click)

35:44.742 --> 35:45.876
Launch.

35:55.686 --> 35:57.822
(grunts, gasps)

35:58.757 --> 35:59.824
(screams)

36:05.664 --> 36:08.032
(panting)

36:08.065 --> 36:10.768
We got to get
back
to the library.

36:25.550 --> 36:28.152
Easy, darlin'.
These things

36:28.186 --> 36:30.422
go through you faster than
Grandpa Pete's chili.

36:30.456 --> 36:33.391
I want to do Buffy.
My wedding present

36:33.425 --> 36:35.327
for what happened
to your poor brother.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.063
Tector.
When's she coming?

36:38.096 --> 36:41.500
Well, he's her watcher.
She'll show.

36:41.532 --> 36:44.536
Just as soon as she gets rid
of some of our competition.

36:50.775 --> 36:54.211
They're heading west,
back into town.

36:54.246 --> 36:55.914
They got away?

36:55.947 --> 36:57.583
Temporarily.

36:57.615 --> 37:01.219
Well, give it up for the
slayers. They got character.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.856
(knocking)

37:05.891 --> 37:07.893
I'll take care of it.

37:12.664 --> 37:15.766
Evening, gentlemen.
How may I help you?

37:15.800 --> 37:18.936
Excuse me...
Anybody got a warrant here?

37:20.806 --> 37:22.440
Jungle Bob and spikehead
are down and out.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.775
We've lost the Germans
twice, but they seem

37:23.809 --> 37:25.610
to keep finding
us.
If we take them
out

37:25.643 --> 37:27.478
and the Gorches, we
can
still make homecoming.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.079
Those animals.
Hunting us down

37:29.114 --> 37:30.981
like poor, defenseless...

37:31.016 --> 37:33.018
well, animals.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.922
We just need to find Giles.
(growling)

37:45.195 --> 37:46.831
Buffy!

37:54.639 --> 37:55.773
Candy!

37:58.876 --> 38:00.311
Oh, Candy.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.648
I'm gonna kill
both
you slayers for this!

38:02.681 --> 38:05.282
You hear me?
I hear you, you redneck
moron.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.485
You got a dress
that goes with that hat?

38:07.518 --> 38:08.686
Oh, I'm gonna...

38:08.719 --> 38:10.422
Rip out my innards,
play with my eyeballs,

38:10.456 --> 38:12.958
boil my brain
and eat it for brunch?

38:12.990 --> 38:14.960
Listen up, needle-brain.
Buffy and I

38:14.992 --> 38:16.827
have taken out
four of your cronies,

38:16.862 --> 38:18.028
not to mention
your girlfriend.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.864
Wife!
Whatever.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.867
The point is
I haven't even broken a sweat.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.003
See, in the end,
Buffy's just the runner-up.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.373
I'm the queen.
You get me mad,

38:27.405 --> 38:30.476
what do you think
I'm gonna do to you?

38:35.581 --> 38:37.081
Later.

38:46.224 --> 38:49.327
That should teach him to
mistake you for a slayer.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.697
Yes, I must admit I do feel
partly responsible.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.032
I did give your friends
tacit approval

38:54.065 --> 38:55.867
to make the
switch
in the limousine.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.503
Ah, it's okay.
It gave Cor and I a chance

38:58.536 --> 39:00.338
to spend some
quality death time.

39:00.371 --> 39:03.041
And we got these
free corsages.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.342
Oh, that's nice.

39:05.376 --> 39:08.045
Although I don't recall
them mentioning corsages.

39:08.079 --> 39:11.181
Jungle Bob said that the Germans

39:11.215 --> 39:14.085
were hooked into
a computer
system.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.190
And they're hooked into us.

39:19.224 --> 39:20.391
(door slams in distance)

39:24.596 --> 39:26.664
Oh God, get
rid
of these things.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.166
I need some
wet toilet paper.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.402
Yeah. That'll
help.

39:35.139 --> 39:36.907
OLD MAN:
Transmitting coordinates now.

39:39.244 --> 39:40.778
They're 50 feet away.

39:53.257 --> 39:55.927
Axis six degrees by 43.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.097
I have them both in range.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.905
I have the targets together
at 20 feet north and stationary.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.907
Final position is locked.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.942
Fire when ready.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.583
Both targets seven degrees

40:17.615 --> 40:18.817
by 35.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.623
Adjust right ten degrees.

40:24.655 --> 40:25.757
Fire!

40:32.329 --> 40:35.166
(grunting)

40:42.172 --> 40:45.010
I won.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.443
(snaps fingers)

40:57.655 --> 40:59.791
Hello. Nice to meet you.

40:59.824 --> 41:02.327
Yeah, hi.
It's a pleasure. Where am I?

41:02.360 --> 41:04.195
In my office.
I'm Richard Wilkins.

41:04.228 --> 41:06.864
I'm the mayor of
Sunnydale, and you're...

41:06.898 --> 41:08.634
Mr. Trick.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.034
Please, sit down.

41:12.737 --> 41:15.507
That's an exciting suit.

41:15.541 --> 41:18.510
Well, clothes make the man.

41:18.543 --> 41:20.778
Well, as I understand it,

41:20.811 --> 41:23.380
you're not a man, exactly.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.050
Mr. Trick,

41:25.083 --> 41:27.052
I've been the mayor
for quite some time.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.186
I like things to run
smoothly.

41:29.219 --> 41:31.456
This is a very
important year for me.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.358
Election year.

41:33.391 --> 41:35.159
Something like that.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.195
If this is the point
where you tell me

41:37.228 --> 41:39.965
that I don't fit in here in
your quiet little neighborhood,

41:39.998 --> 41:42.233
you can just skip it.
'Cause, see, that all got old

41:42.266 --> 41:44.135
long before I became a vampire.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.704
Do you know what I'm saying?

41:45.737 --> 41:47.405
Do you have children?

41:48.907 --> 41:51.041
Children are the heart
of a
community.

41:51.076 --> 41:54.045
They need to be looked
after. Controlled.

41:54.079 --> 41:56.347
The more rebellious
element

41:56.380 --> 41:58.516
needs to be dealt
with.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.184
The children are our future.

42:00.217 --> 42:02.253
We need them.

42:02.286 --> 42:03.922
I need them.

42:03.954 --> 42:05.556
If this rebellious element

42:05.590 --> 42:08.693
means who I think it does,
then that problem

42:08.726 --> 42:11.862
may be taken care of
this very night.

42:11.896 --> 42:14.065
So I've heard.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.166
That's a very enterprising idea
you have-- Slayerfest.

42:16.201 --> 42:19.570
I love that name,
by the way.

42:19.605 --> 42:23.541
You see, that's the kind
of initiative I need on my team.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.710
What if I don't want to be
a part of the team?

42:25.744 --> 42:28.746
Oh, no.
That won't be an issue.

42:30.648 --> 42:34.085
See, you and I are gonna
get along very well.

42:34.119 --> 42:36.755
Moist towelette?

42:36.788 --> 42:38.623
(drumroll)

42:38.657 --> 42:41.626
Hey guys, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

42:41.659 --> 42:43.260
(drumroll ends)

42:43.293 --> 42:45.563
They're gonna
announce the queen.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.532
Where are they?
What's keeping them?

42:47.565 --> 42:49.934
I'm gonna go with
mud wrestling.

42:53.137 --> 42:56.273
Oh, God! What did you two
do to each other?

42:56.306 --> 42:58.710
Long story.
Got hunted.

42:58.744 --> 43:00.778
Apparently
not that long.

43:02.179 --> 43:03.949
Tell you one
thing, though...

43:03.981 --> 43:05.784
you don't want to
mess with
Cordelia.

43:05.817 --> 43:07.418
(chuckles

43:07.452 --> 43:08.719
No.

43:08.753 --> 43:11.422
In this envelope,
I hold the
name

43:11.456 --> 43:14.458
of this year's homecoming queen.

43:14.492 --> 43:16.728
After all that
we've
been through tonight,

43:16.762 --> 43:19.764
this whole "who gets to be
queen" capade seems pretty...

43:19.797 --> 43:21.967
Damn important.
Oh, yeah.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.269
And the winner is...

43:30.775 --> 43:33.344
Hey, I believe we have a first
for Sunnydale
High.

43:33.378 --> 43:35.280
We have a tie.

43:35.313 --> 43:39.050
The winners are Holly Charleston
and Michelle
Blake.

43:52.297 --> 43:55.500
I'm just so honored!

43:55.532 --> 43:57.135
I can't believe it!

43:57.168 --> 43:59.436
I mean, that you would
pick me-- or us--

43:59.469 --> 44:01.206
out of every girl
in the whole school!

44:01.239 --> 44:05.309
It's just...
it's so
wonderful!

44:05.342 --> 44:08.579
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry. (crying)

44:41.880 --> 44:44.349
Grr. Argh.
