WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:03.576
He was shackled,
nailed into a packing crate,

00:03.600 --> 00:04.877
the crate is wrapped in chains,

00:04.901 --> 00:05.912
and then the crate is dropped

00:05.936 --> 00:07.413
into the bottom of the East River,

00:07.437 --> 00:08.981
and still he manages to escape.

00:09.005 --> 00:11.217
This is a day in the life of
a federal public defender.

00:11.241 --> 00:12.885
Okay, have you ever made
an elephant disappear?

00:12.909 --> 00:14.220
I got you to dismiss the case against

00:14.244 --> 00:16.322
Victor "The Walrus" Torrazzo last year.

00:16.346 --> 00:18.357
"Houdini's Escapes."
Where did you get this?

00:18.381 --> 00:19.792
The Strand.

00:19.816 --> 00:21.093
Is there anything you don't read?

00:21.117 --> 00:23.963
I generally avoid fantasy,
books about beads,

00:23.987 --> 00:26.098
and used automobile manuals.

00:26.122 --> 00:27.967
Other than that, I'll probably read it.

00:27.991 --> 00:30.203
And when Houdini performed
the underwater box trick

00:30.227 --> 00:32.371
off of Battery Park in 1914,

00:32.395 --> 00:35.208
15,000 people showed up.

00:35.232 --> 00:36.609
Should we go take a look?

00:36.633 --> 00:37.910
Are they all still there?

00:37.934 --> 00:39.045
We can pretend,

00:39.069 --> 00:40.279
and we don't have to go into the office.

00:41.538 --> 00:42.982
Ohh, I have to go into the office.

00:43.006 --> 00:44.850
- No. Really?
- It's your fault.

00:44.874 --> 00:46.652
That's not a nice thing to say.

00:46.676 --> 00:48.354
Drop the charges
and I can hang out all day.

00:48.378 --> 00:50.109
Otherwise, I got to go figure
out how to escape from this.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.157
I can't do that.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.858
I don't even know what that is,
and I know I can't do that.

00:52.882 --> 00:54.393
You know exactly what it is.

00:54.417 --> 00:55.795
Murder?

00:55.819 --> 00:56.963
Don't be afraid of murder.

00:56.987 --> 00:58.431
I am afraid of murder.

00:58.455 --> 00:59.498
D-Did someone say murder?

00:59.522 --> 01:01.534
I think you heard "duty."

01:01.558 --> 01:03.636
It's a joke because murder doesn't
sound anything like duty.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.238
Steve Caldwell, 22,

01:05.262 --> 01:07.673
arrested for strangling
Ellie Mason to death

01:07.697 --> 01:09.542
near a music festival
on Governor's Island.

01:09.566 --> 01:11.110
I heard someone talking
about this on the train.

01:11.134 --> 01:12.812
I heard everybody talking
about this on the train.

01:12.836 --> 01:13.879
I was on my bike,

01:13.903 --> 01:16.215
and it's hard to hear
because of the wind.

01:16.239 --> 01:17.283
Go ahead.

01:17.307 --> 01:18.651
Why do we have this?

01:18.675 --> 01:20.319
The body was found on federal property

01:20.343 --> 01:21.454
near Castle Williams.

01:21.478 --> 01:23.256
NYPD turned it over to the feds.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.690
There are two eyewitnesses

01:24.714 --> 01:27.260
who saw them leave
the music festival together,

01:27.284 --> 01:28.894
his keycard was used

01:28.918 --> 01:30.663
to open a nearby miniature golf course...

01:30.687 --> 01:31.964
where they apparently fooled around

01:31.988 --> 01:33.699
before walking to Castle Williams...

01:33.723 --> 01:35.501
and a medical examiner's report

01:35.525 --> 01:37.336
indicating that she was strangled.

01:37.360 --> 01:39.238
- That's it?
- No.

01:39.262 --> 01:40.439
He also made a statement.

01:40.463 --> 01:42.275
- He confessed?
- According to the complaint.

01:42.299 --> 01:43.309
We need the statement

01:43.333 --> 01:44.844
and any recordings they might have made.

01:44.868 --> 01:46.746
We also need Steve's criminal history

01:46.770 --> 01:47.947
and anything you can find

01:47.971 --> 01:50.182
about the relationship
between Ellie and Steve.

01:50.206 --> 01:52.385
And we need to dig into Ellie. And folks?

01:52.409 --> 01:53.619
Stay sharp because people

01:53.643 --> 01:56.022
aren't gonna stop talking
about this anytime soon.

01:59.049 --> 02:01.861
Ms. Bell, I haven't seen you
on duty in a while.

02:01.885 --> 02:04.063
Well, I'm happy to be back.
Sharpen the skills.

02:04.087 --> 02:05.498
- Good breakfast?
- Ready to go.

02:05.522 --> 02:07.168
You need to have a good breakfast.

02:07.192 --> 02:09.101
- Mm-hmm.
- U.S. v. John Toe.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.836
- You mean Doe.
- Toe.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.204
Right. Doe. You said Toe.

02:12.228 --> 02:14.440
- Right, Toe.
- Doe.

02:14.464 --> 02:16.175
- Toe?
- That is correct, Your Honor.

02:16.199 --> 02:17.777
He was found with a toe?

02:17.801 --> 02:18.844
Yes, at the airport.

02:18.868 --> 02:21.247
Ms. Bell, are you okay?

02:21.271 --> 02:22.682
Yes, I'm fine.

02:22.706 --> 02:24.684
My... breakfast.

02:24.708 --> 02:25.885
I'm okay. Thank you.

02:25.909 --> 02:27.586
Your Honor, the defendant,
Douglas Bradshaw,

02:27.610 --> 02:30.356
was apprehended by TSA
with a toe in his cooler...

02:30.380 --> 02:31.357
Which is not illegal.

02:31.381 --> 02:34.026
Well, doesn't that depend on how
the toe got there, Ms. Bell?

02:34.050 --> 02:37.063
Mr. Bradshaw is
a human tissue broker with UNY.

02:37.087 --> 02:39.265
The transport of organs
and limbs is perfectly legal.

02:39.289 --> 02:42.001
We don't dispute that, but
Mr. Bradshaw was arrested

02:42.025 --> 02:44.437
because he became combative
with the TSA officers

02:44.461 --> 02:46.806
when they reasonably
questioned him about the toe...

02:46.830 --> 02:49.041
Because Mr. Bradshaw
was rushing to catch a flight

02:49.065 --> 02:51.644
to visit his sick mother and
was reasonably agitated

02:51.668 --> 02:53.179
at the suggestion
he had done anything wrong.

02:53.203 --> 02:54.380
He knocked over the cooler,

02:54.404 --> 02:56.816
and the toe rolled
through the screening area,

02:56.840 --> 02:59.418
approximately 25...

02:59.442 --> 03:00.453
feet.

03:00.477 --> 03:03.422
Why exactly would someone buy a toe?

03:03.446 --> 03:06.525
Well, uh, you could use the
bone for periodontal cement.

03:06.549 --> 03:08.094
There's surgical practice...

03:08.118 --> 03:10.196
toe augmentation, toe shortening...

03:10.220 --> 03:12.331
People get their toes shortened?

03:12.355 --> 03:14.233
Oh, yes. Toe jobs?

03:14.257 --> 03:17.069
Oh, yes, uh, definitely a growing market.

03:17.093 --> 03:19.305
If you think about it,
you have a hammer toe,

03:19.329 --> 03:20.706
but you wanna wear a strappy sandal...

03:20.730 --> 03:22.508
Okay, I think I get it.

03:22.532 --> 03:26.445
I will release Mr. Bradshaw
on a $10,000 bond.

03:26.469 --> 03:28.414
Hey, um, that toe...

03:28.438 --> 03:30.049
it's only worth, like, 500 bucks,

03:30.073 --> 03:31.484
but I got a bunch of ankles at home

03:31.508 --> 03:32.918
that should cover the rest.

03:32.942 --> 03:34.242
Cool?

03:37.247 --> 03:38.958
You were working a merchandise table

03:38.982 --> 03:40.581
at the music festival?

03:43.253 --> 03:44.630
Yes. I was.

03:44.654 --> 03:47.255
And that's where you met Ellie Mason.

03:48.425 --> 03:50.169
According to your statement,

03:50.193 --> 03:52.138
you went to the miniature golf course

03:52.162 --> 03:53.672
on the island together.

03:53.696 --> 03:55.641
- Yes?
- I work there.

03:55.665 --> 03:58.277
Did anybody see you there together?

03:58.301 --> 03:59.578
I don't know.

03:59.602 --> 04:00.880
You told the police

04:00.904 --> 04:03.449
you and Ellie went to Castle Williams

04:03.473 --> 04:05.551
after you left the golf course.

04:05.575 --> 04:08.687
Did you and Ellie walk to Castle
Williams after you left...

04:08.711 --> 04:10.956
Why do I have to keep saying it?

04:10.980 --> 04:14.326
The same things, over and over.

04:14.350 --> 04:16.695
Yes, we walked to Castle Williams.

04:16.719 --> 04:18.297
And as far as you're aware,

04:18.321 --> 04:21.801
nobody saw you together
at Castle Williams, right?

04:21.825 --> 04:23.791
No, that's not true.

04:25.061 --> 04:26.338
Someone saw us.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.475
The police have a witness.

04:31.468 --> 04:34.180
He says the police
told him there was a witness

04:34.204 --> 04:36.816
who saw him with Ellie at Castle Williams

04:36.840 --> 04:38.317
- right before she was killed.
- Jill.

04:38.341 --> 04:40.953
But that's not mentioned
anywhere in the complaint.

04:40.977 --> 04:42.688
I want to find out what happened
to this witness.

04:42.712 --> 04:43.856
Jill!

04:43.880 --> 04:45.394
I think we know what happened.

04:46.182 --> 04:49.528
The last time I saw her
was at the golf course.

04:49.552 --> 04:51.163
- I'm telling you...
- Steve.

04:51.187 --> 04:55.468
She said that she had to
find her friends, go home.

04:55.492 --> 04:58.370
She left and I stayed
and put some things away.

04:58.394 --> 05:00.539
You need to talk to us.

05:00.563 --> 05:02.074
- She left.
- Steve.

05:02.098 --> 05:03.242
I didn't see her again.

05:03.266 --> 05:05.110
Listen to me, we know what happened.

05:05.134 --> 05:06.412
We know, okay?

05:06.436 --> 05:07.913
We just need you to be honest with us.

05:07.937 --> 05:09.982
Did you leave the golf course with her?

05:10.006 --> 05:11.183
- I...
- We know.

05:11.207 --> 05:12.518
There's a witness.

05:12.542 --> 05:15.488
There's a witness, Steve, who saw
you with her at Castle Williams.

05:15.512 --> 05:17.423
You need to be honest with us now.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.425
What happened when you left Golf 'n Fun?

05:24.320 --> 05:25.753
We took...

05:27.690 --> 05:29.301
a walk?

05:29.325 --> 05:32.638
Okay. Good.

05:32.662 --> 05:34.039
Where'd you go?

05:34.063 --> 05:35.441
The only way we can help you

05:35.465 --> 05:36.876
is if you talk to us.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.344
Where'd you go?

05:38.368 --> 05:39.912
To Castle Williams.

05:39.936 --> 05:42.403
You and Ellie took a walk
to Castle Williams?

05:43.873 --> 05:45.217
Yes.

05:45.241 --> 05:49.288
This goes on for 14 hours
until you get to...

05:49.312 --> 05:51.056
...this.

05:51.080 --> 05:54.460
Ellie and I left the golf course.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.862
We walked to Castle Williams.

05:56.886 --> 05:59.164
She wanted to leave.

05:59.188 --> 06:02.434
I got angry. I hit her.

06:02.458 --> 06:05.804
I started... choking her.

06:05.828 --> 06:07.006
I choked her.

06:07.893 --> 06:09.769
I killed her.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.179
There was no witness. They made it up.

06:14.203 --> 06:16.949
This was a false confession.

06:20.610 --> 06:27.830
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:28.862 --> 06:31.641
Mason's body was found
early Sunday morning

06:31.666 --> 06:33.571
on Governor's Island by a member...

06:33.596 --> 06:34.839
Knox, Oliver. Come with me.

06:34.863 --> 06:36.041
Clear your schedules...

06:36.065 --> 06:38.014
postponements, continuances,
whatever you have to do.

06:38.038 --> 06:39.110
Whatever you need me to do.

06:39.134 --> 06:40.345
Us, 'cause I'm here, too.

06:40.369 --> 06:41.913
- This is important.
- Understood.

06:41.937 --> 06:43.014
- Work together on this.
- Of course.

06:43.038 --> 06:44.516
This is everything you need.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.451
This is... a map?

06:46.475 --> 06:47.485
You're off to a good start.

06:47.509 --> 06:48.587
We're on the Caldwell case, right,

06:48.611 --> 06:49.888
the murder on Governor's Island?

06:49.912 --> 06:51.356
What? God, no, that's capital murder.

06:51.380 --> 06:52.691
That's upstairs.

06:52.715 --> 06:55.160
You're speaking to a conference
of future lawyers...

06:55.184 --> 06:56.761
something that I agreed to with the bar

06:56.785 --> 06:58.830
a few months ago.

06:58.854 --> 07:01.566
I would go myself, but I don't want to.

07:01.590 --> 07:03.168
Do not embarrass this office or me,

07:03.192 --> 07:04.970
if you can help it,

07:04.994 --> 07:06.404
which you probably can't.

07:09.098 --> 07:10.642
And after the appeal was denied,

07:10.666 --> 07:12.844
the case was remanded
back to the district court

07:12.868 --> 07:13.945
for further proceedings,

07:13.969 --> 07:16.214
which was a bench trial.

07:16.238 --> 07:17.704
Which I won.

07:20.676 --> 07:21.987
Won what?

07:22.597 --> 07:24.723
- Trial.
- What's trial?

07:25.387 --> 07:26.725
Do you remember how I was...

07:26.749 --> 07:28.526
My sister has a bird!

07:28.550 --> 07:30.428
Any other questions?

07:30.452 --> 07:32.797
Why don't you go after the banks?

07:32.821 --> 07:35.200
My dad says you don't go after the banks.

07:35.224 --> 07:36.835
- We do.
- No, you don't.

07:36.859 --> 07:38.203
- We do.
- No, you don't.

07:38.227 --> 07:39.804
- We do.
- No, you don't.

07:39.828 --> 07:41.106
Why don't you like birds?!

07:41.130 --> 07:42.574
Who wants to see a magic trick?

07:42.598 --> 07:44.142
Me!

07:45.339 --> 07:47.669
Thank you, guys. That was great.

07:47.693 --> 07:48.813
Tough crowd.

07:48.837 --> 07:50.382
Well, it's a good thing

07:50.406 --> 07:51.983
you can make a quarter disappear.

07:52.007 --> 07:54.319
- I need to learn that trick.
- I can teach you.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.920
We should really be
getting back, but thank you.

07:55.944 --> 07:57.422
We appreciate the opportunity to come in

07:57.446 --> 07:58.657
and talk about the work that we do...

07:58.681 --> 08:00.325
Which is nothing compared
to the work you do.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.793
That's so nice of you to say.

08:01.817 --> 08:02.927
And so totally true.

08:04.186 --> 08:06.398
Uh, hey, if you ever need help
with anything...

08:06.422 --> 08:09.734
legal or whatever...
we'd be happy to help.

08:09.758 --> 08:13.238
If you wanna take our information
or my information...

08:13.262 --> 08:15.674
Yeah. Okay. Great.

08:15.698 --> 08:17.542
Assuming I get in some legal trouble.

08:17.566 --> 08:18.610
Let's hope not.

08:18.634 --> 08:19.811
Or let's. Who's to say?

08:24.373 --> 08:26.117
Serena Nazari.

08:27.342 --> 08:29.721
I better go before one of them
makes a break for it.

08:36.818 --> 08:38.063
What?

08:38.087 --> 08:39.953
I can show you the quarter trick, too.

08:43.125 --> 08:44.803
Welcome to the War Room.

08:44.827 --> 08:46.204
We have a War Room?

08:46.228 --> 08:48.740
- I thought this was storage.
- That, too.

08:48.764 --> 08:49.941
But there's a working table

08:49.965 --> 08:52.277
under here somewhere and some chairs.

08:52.301 --> 08:53.378
And the Ark of the Covenant.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.813
Why do we need a War Room?

08:54.837 --> 08:56.915
The single most difficult
piece of evidence

08:56.939 --> 08:59.818
to overcome in any criminal proceeding

08:59.842 --> 09:00.852
is a confession.

09:00.876 --> 09:02.787
It is why we have the Fifth Amendment.

09:02.811 --> 09:04.522
It is why we have Miranda rights.

09:04.546 --> 09:06.725
It is the vast, immovable object

09:06.749 --> 09:07.926
in the middle of our case,

09:07.950 --> 09:09.427
and there's no easy way over it

09:09.451 --> 09:11.763
or around it or underneath it.

09:11.787 --> 09:14.199
Our only real chance
is removing it altogether.

09:14.223 --> 09:15.533
A Motion to Suppress.

09:15.557 --> 09:16.634
Exactly.

09:16.658 --> 09:18.503
If we can get the confession thrown out,

09:18.527 --> 09:20.205
we can get Steve's case thrown out.

09:20.229 --> 09:21.673
The case is the confession.

09:21.697 --> 09:22.974
So we attack the confession.

09:22.998 --> 09:24.409
Steve was read his Miranda rights.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.010
He waived his right to an attorney.

09:26.034 --> 09:28.379
But that doesn't mean
the confession was voluntary.

09:28.403 --> 09:30.582
Our job now is to show that it wasn't.

09:30.606 --> 09:32.250
We treat the interrogation itself

09:32.274 --> 09:34.552
- like a crime.
- Yes.

09:34.576 --> 09:36.910
Which means we start with the victim.

09:42.985 --> 09:44.863
I... I was so tired.

09:44.887 --> 09:47.432
- I know.
- I felt like I was losing my mind.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.033
You were. That was the point.

09:49.057 --> 09:50.802
Why? Why did they do this?

09:50.826 --> 09:52.504
Because somewhere in the beginning,

09:52.528 --> 09:54.973
they attached themselves
to the idea you were it.

09:54.997 --> 09:56.141
From that point forward,

09:56.165 --> 09:58.576
either they were gonna break or you were.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.500
I broke.

10:02.504 --> 10:04.616
Yeah, they got in my head, and I broke.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.351
A lot of people do, Steve,

10:06.375 --> 10:08.052
more than you can possibly imagine.

10:08.076 --> 10:09.354
I don't want you to feel...

10:09.378 --> 10:13.547
I confessed to a crime I did not commit.

10:15.918 --> 10:17.726
I didn't kill that girl.

10:18.754 --> 10:20.365
I did not kill that girl.

10:20.389 --> 10:21.966
Steve...

10:21.990 --> 10:24.903
I know how difficult this is,

10:24.927 --> 10:28.706
but I need you to tell me everything
you can about the interrogation.

10:28.730 --> 10:30.230
Everything.

10:31.867 --> 10:33.600
Okay, um...

10:34.703 --> 10:36.953
The room was small.

10:37.539 --> 10:39.284
I felt like I-I couldn't move,

10:39.308 --> 10:41.319
and there were all
these people in there...

10:41.343 --> 10:43.454
the... the two detectives the whole time,

10:43.478 --> 10:45.256
but other cops coming in and out.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.825
It was hot.

10:46.849 --> 10:49.627
I was hungry, thirsty.

10:49.651 --> 10:50.929
I was hungover.

10:50.953 --> 10:52.931
E-Every time I asked for water,

10:52.955 --> 10:55.597
they gave me a little cup.

10:56.758 --> 10:58.536
Um... I mean, h-how many times

10:58.560 --> 11:00.594
are you gonna ask a cop for water?

11:02.130 --> 11:04.843
They... They told me
that they had evidence,

11:04.867 --> 11:06.144
not just witnesses.

11:06.168 --> 11:07.312
They had my prints.

11:07.336 --> 11:09.614
They brought in a forensics expert.

11:09.638 --> 11:12.083
He said all the marks on Ellie's neck

11:12.107 --> 11:13.585
fit my hands...

11:13.609 --> 11:15.086
a perfect match.

11:15.110 --> 11:16.821
He showed me the lab report.

11:16.845 --> 11:18.389
That "expert" was just a file clerk

11:18.413 --> 11:19.524
in the police station.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.992
The lab report was fake, too.

11:21.016 --> 11:22.360
And they... they... they kept saying

11:22.384 --> 11:25.530
that they were going to help me,

11:25.554 --> 11:29.300
and they... they said that I
was in, uh, real trouble,

11:29.324 --> 11:32.704
but if I was honest, they could help.

11:32.728 --> 11:35.073
And I-I didn't know who to talk to.

11:35.097 --> 11:37.889
I haven't seen my folks for years.

11:38.901 --> 11:40.011
I was scared.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.581
He was kicked out of his house
when he was 14,

11:43.605 --> 11:46.951
abusive stepfather,
never finished high school.

11:46.975 --> 11:49.087
He lives with his grandmother,
who is sick,

11:49.111 --> 11:51.757
but seems to be the only one
who's ever cared about this kid.

11:52.881 --> 11:54.492
What ha... What happens now?

11:54.516 --> 11:57.495
We pull all this together,
we write a motion,

11:57.519 --> 12:00.598
we file it, we argue it,

12:00.622 --> 12:02.033
and then we wait.

12:08.864 --> 12:10.463
Ugh.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:19.675 --> 12:20.785
Yeah, I see that.

12:20.809 --> 12:23.521
It does look sawed and not chopped.

12:23.545 --> 12:25.924
Anyway, Kate, I watched the TSA footage.

12:25.948 --> 12:27.058
Yes, he's a little agitated,

12:27.082 --> 12:28.760
but I think the toe rolling on the ground

12:28.784 --> 12:30.028
got everybody worked up.

12:30.052 --> 12:31.162
We're adding more charges.

12:31.186 --> 12:33.464
What?! What... W-What
are you talking about?

12:33.488 --> 12:36.467
Turns out all bodies donated
to the UNY Medical School

12:36.491 --> 12:38.002
are done so with the explicit condition

12:38.026 --> 12:40.705
that they will be used
only by the university,

12:40.729 --> 12:42.507
not sold to third parties,

12:42.531 --> 12:45.043
which means that in order
to take and sell body parts

12:45.067 --> 12:46.411
from the university,

12:46.435 --> 12:48.079
Doug must first have stolen them,

12:48.103 --> 12:49.414
- ergo...
- Ergo?

12:49.438 --> 12:50.815
Ergo, we will be adding

12:50.839 --> 12:53.351
transportation of stolen goods
over state lines.

12:55.143 --> 12:56.654
What was that?

12:56.678 --> 12:58.089
Nothing, I'm fine.

12:58.113 --> 13:00.325
Can you just hang on
a few hours, will you?

13:00.349 --> 13:02.560
Just let me talk to Doug.

13:02.584 --> 13:04.762
Stealing? No.

13:04.786 --> 13:06.331
This is my job.

13:06.355 --> 13:07.565
Did they talk to Pete Dolan?

13:07.589 --> 13:09.000
W-Who's Pete Dolan?

13:09.024 --> 13:11.803
He's in charge of the Willed
Bodies Department at UNY.

13:11.827 --> 13:14.305
Yeah, he'd tell me what to
cut, where to bring it,

13:14.329 --> 13:16.307
then he'd pay me every week,
right after I bring him

13:16.331 --> 13:17.809
the cashier's checks from Jerome.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.877
- Jerome?
- Jerome Kaplan.

13:19.901 --> 13:22.914
He works at Cryogive Tissue Bank...

13:22.938 --> 13:26.284
provides human remains for medical
and commercial research purposes.

13:26.308 --> 13:28.052
He's our primary buyer.

13:28.076 --> 13:29.187
Pete and Jerome go way back.

13:29.211 --> 13:30.655
Ha, they do, huh?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.957
So you carried body parts
from Dolan to Kaplan,

13:32.981 --> 13:35.860
and cashier's checks back
from Kaplan to Dolan?

13:35.884 --> 13:37.862
And you got your cut in cash?

13:37.886 --> 13:39.430
20%.

13:39.454 --> 13:41.132
10% if the parts were just leased.

13:41.156 --> 13:42.467
Oh, there's leasing?

13:42.491 --> 13:45.603
Oh, sure. Plenty of things can
be reused a bunch of times...

13:45.627 --> 13:47.405
torsos, necks.

13:47.429 --> 13:49.774
They just do their thing, close 'em up,

13:49.798 --> 13:51.743
send 'em back,
next guy opens 'em back up...

13:51.767 --> 13:52.983
Mm-hmm.

13:53.602 --> 13:55.013
Wait...

13:55.037 --> 13:57.315
You think this was all illegal,
don't you?

13:57.339 --> 14:01.452
But Pete and Jerome...
they're such nice guys.

14:01.476 --> 14:03.994
Even nice guys do illegal things.

14:04.613 --> 14:06.057
But don't worry, Doug.

14:06.081 --> 14:08.192
That could be good for us.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.804
We lost?

14:24.566 --> 14:25.899
Okay.

14:27.536 --> 14:30.381
So, now we have to do what
the prosecution didn't...

14:30.405 --> 14:33.451
build an alternative theory
of who killed Ellie Mason.

14:33.475 --> 14:34.685
We need to cast as much doubt

14:34.709 --> 14:36.187
on the government's version of events

14:36.211 --> 14:37.455
as we can,

14:37.479 --> 14:38.856
and we need a suspect.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.793
You said confessions are almost
impossible to overcome.

14:41.817 --> 14:43.094
They are.

14:43.118 --> 14:45.797
So now we try to do the impossible.

14:45.821 --> 14:47.065
That is what we do.

14:47.089 --> 14:48.466
We lost a battle.

14:48.490 --> 14:49.934
We regroup, we bind our wounds,

14:49.958 --> 14:51.102
we get back out there.

14:51.126 --> 14:52.470
Why do we have a War Room?

14:52.494 --> 14:54.505
Because this is war.

14:54.529 --> 14:55.777
And now we fight.

15:00.273 --> 15:01.759
I'm sorry about the mess.

15:02.373 --> 15:03.984
I wasn't expecting anybody.

15:04.008 --> 15:06.255
Mm-hmm, yeah, no worries.

15:06.256 --> 15:08.501
Mine gets like this sometimes, too.

15:08.525 --> 15:10.169
Okay, so,

15:10.193 --> 15:12.805
this is security camera footage

15:12.829 --> 15:15.274
from the entrance to the
medical-school body freezer.

15:15.298 --> 15:16.843
Does this look like a person sneaking in

15:16.867 --> 15:18.525
to steal something?

15:19.436 --> 15:21.445
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey, Doug.

15:21.938 --> 15:23.349
He knows the security guard.

15:23.373 --> 15:24.784
He's walking in
with a hack saw and a cooler

15:24.808 --> 15:25.752
at 11:00 A.M.

15:25.776 --> 15:27.153
What's your point?

15:27.177 --> 15:29.021
Doug didn't know
he was doing anything wrong.

15:29.045 --> 15:30.223
But I'll tell you who did...

15:30.247 --> 15:31.891
Pete Dolan,

15:31.915 --> 15:33.960
head of the Willed Bodies
Department at UNY,

15:33.984 --> 15:37.296
and Jerome Kaplan,
owner of Cryogive Tissue Bank.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.931
They were business partners
six years ago,

15:38.955 --> 15:40.366
prior to taking their current positions.

15:40.390 --> 15:42.101
I believe they hatched a plan

15:42.125 --> 15:44.137
where Dolan sells
illegally obtained body parts

15:44.161 --> 15:45.505
to Kaplan at below-market rates,

15:45.529 --> 15:47.940
and Dolan pockets almost all of the cash.

15:47.964 --> 15:50.176
They are the masterminds
of this, not Doug.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.511
I take it you have a proposal?

15:51.535 --> 15:53.212
These two don't know
Doug's been arrested.

15:53.236 --> 15:56.048
There's a training seminar later
this week for medical researchers

15:56.072 --> 15:58.284
at the beautiful Secaucus Suites Inn.

15:58.308 --> 16:00.052
Let Doug do one more delivery,

16:00.076 --> 16:03.356
and he'll get Kaplan to
implicate himself and Dolan.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.124
You can get them on wire fraud
and conspiracy,

16:05.148 --> 16:07.493
and I'm sure you'll come up with
a bunch of other stuff, too.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.630
He gets us enough on tape,

16:10.654 --> 16:12.832
we drop transportation of stolen goods,

16:12.856 --> 16:15.768
and I'll take probation
on the TSA charge.

16:19.429 --> 16:20.439
I'm too in my head.

16:20.463 --> 16:21.941
You're too in my office.

16:21.965 --> 16:23.242
What should I text Serena
out of the gate?

16:23.266 --> 16:24.310
Nothing.

16:24.334 --> 16:26.245
That will make it hard
to ask her out, though.

16:26.269 --> 16:28.014
Initial contact is always a phone call,

16:28.038 --> 16:29.782
never a text.

16:29.806 --> 16:31.184
Everyone texts.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.819
Not Seth Oliver.

16:32.843 --> 16:34.620
Seth Oliver is old school.

16:34.644 --> 16:36.956
Seth Oliver takes the time
to have a real conversation.

16:36.980 --> 16:39.625
Seth Oliver wants to get to know you.

16:39.649 --> 16:41.160
Brilliant.

16:41.184 --> 16:43.262
You are the master. Thank you.

16:43.286 --> 16:45.097
What do I say?

16:45.121 --> 16:46.732
- Nothing.
- That's confusing.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.267
Let her do the talking,
ask her questions,

16:48.291 --> 16:50.518
respond to what she's saying. Listen.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.838
How long do we talk before I ask her out?

16:51.862 --> 16:53.773
Never ask a girl out on the phone.

16:53.797 --> 16:55.428
- I thought that was the whole point.
- Leave it open-ended.

16:55.452 --> 16:57.310
Say you want to hang out sometime,

16:57.334 --> 16:59.145
then you text her,

16:59.169 --> 17:00.880
continuing the conversation,
making plans,

17:00.904 --> 17:02.748
winning her over with your wit and charm.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.017
Or your dad jokes and
magic tricks... whatever.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.086
Let her talk, leave it open-ended,

17:07.109 --> 17:09.021
dad jokes.

17:09.045 --> 17:10.144
I got this.

17:11.815 --> 17:13.226
Have you sorted through
all the discovery yet?

17:13.250 --> 17:14.460
- Yes, but...
- What about Ellie's friends?

17:14.483 --> 17:16.061
- Has anyone talked to them?
- Yes. In fact, that's what...

17:16.086 --> 17:17.997
And forensics?
If any are still outstanding...

17:18.021 --> 17:19.397
Jill!

17:19.422 --> 17:20.855
Ted found something.

17:21.758 --> 17:23.102
Who am I looking at?

17:23.126 --> 17:25.894
This is Hank... Hank Porter.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.842
Hank is large. Hank is strong.

17:29.866 --> 17:31.210
According to Ellie's friend Kayla,

17:31.234 --> 17:33.346
Ellie and Hank met on a
dating app two months ago.

17:33.370 --> 17:34.580
They went on one date.

17:34.604 --> 17:37.383
And Hank's vibe? Super creepy.

17:37.407 --> 17:39.285
So Ellie ghosted him,
but Hank didn't give up,

17:39.309 --> 17:40.887
kept texting, and a couple weeks later,

17:40.911 --> 17:43.389
he sent her flowers at work.

17:43.413 --> 17:44.557
She still didn't respond,

17:44.581 --> 17:46.826
but apparently he didn't get the message

17:46.850 --> 17:49.395
because her friends
saw Hank at Vinyl Island

17:49.419 --> 17:51.136
looking for Ellie.

17:51.554 --> 17:53.466
He was on the island
the night Ellie was killed?

17:53.490 --> 17:54.634
Yes.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.335
And the cops didn't follow up
with this guy?

17:56.359 --> 17:57.992
They never even talked to him.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.774
We have our suspect.

18:04.434 --> 18:06.279
How did you identify Steve Caldwell

18:06.303 --> 18:07.947
as a suspect in this case?

18:07.971 --> 18:09.582
We saw a male with Ms. Mason

18:09.606 --> 18:11.817
on the golf course
video-surveillance system,

18:11.841 --> 18:13.586
and we later determined Mr. Caldwell used

18:13.610 --> 18:15.021
his key access card that night.

18:15.045 --> 18:17.790
When you first went to interview
Mr. Caldwell at his home,

18:17.814 --> 18:21.160
did he say or do anything
you considered suspicious?

18:21.184 --> 18:24.030
- I found his whole demeanor unusual.
- How so?

18:24.054 --> 18:25.331
When I talked to him about Ellie's death,

18:25.355 --> 18:27.033
he just didn't really react.

18:27.057 --> 18:29.335
You thought he'd be more emotional?

18:29.359 --> 18:32.104
I thought he'd react in some way.

18:32.128 --> 18:34.206
He just shrugged. It was very odd.

18:34.230 --> 18:37.109
In the course of your investigation,
did you identify any witnesses

18:37.133 --> 18:40.112
who saw Mr. Caldwell
and Ms. Mason together

18:40.136 --> 18:41.981
- at Castle Williams?
- No.

18:42.005 --> 18:44.583
Did you collect any video surveillance

18:44.607 --> 18:46.917
that showed them together
at Castle Williams?

18:46.941 --> 18:49.922
- No.
- Did you collect any forensic evidence

18:49.946 --> 18:53.192
linking Mr. Caldwell
to the death of Ms. Mason?

18:53.216 --> 18:54.255
No.

18:54.279 --> 18:55.861
- Hair?
- No.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.223
- Blood?
- No.

18:57.247 --> 18:58.631
- Fingerprints?
- No.

18:58.655 --> 19:00.866
- Shoeprints?
- No.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.469
- DNA?
- No.

19:03.493 --> 19:05.171
Other than Mr. Caldwell,

19:05.195 --> 19:07.139
did you question or even investigate

19:07.163 --> 19:10.322
any other potential suspects
in this case?

19:11.195 --> 19:12.225
No.

19:15.605 --> 19:16.983
You didn't ask him about Hank.

19:17.007 --> 19:18.818
I'm gonna ask other people about Hank.

19:18.842 --> 19:19.986
I just needed Detective Blake

19:20.010 --> 19:21.821
to establish that Hank
wasn't important to him,

19:21.845 --> 19:24.312
and he wasn't, but he will be.

19:26.947 --> 19:28.629
- I need help.
- What's the case?

19:28.654 --> 19:29.965
The case? What?

19:29.989 --> 19:31.166
No, the teacher. Serena.

19:31.190 --> 19:32.834
We've been texting for hours. I'm stuck.

19:32.858 --> 19:33.869
Have you asked her out yet?

19:33.893 --> 19:35.036
There hasn't been a natural opening.

19:35.060 --> 19:36.638
You need to make an opening.

19:36.662 --> 19:37.706
What have you been talking about?

19:37.730 --> 19:39.708
She's from North Carolina,
she went to Rutgers,

19:39.732 --> 19:41.843
studied abroad in Spain, she's a runner,

19:41.867 --> 19:43.881
she paints sometimes,
we both hate horror movies...

19:43.905 --> 19:45.194
Although, I do like "The Sixth Sense."

19:45.218 --> 19:47.082
I don't know if you'd call that horror.
Pretty scary, though.

19:47.106 --> 19:48.416
Nebraska at Rutgers, Thursday night,

19:48.440 --> 19:49.384
ask her to go with you.

19:49.408 --> 19:50.585
You're a genius. Calm down.

19:50.609 --> 19:51.653
It's a football game.

19:51.677 --> 19:54.589
"It's come to my attention

19:54.613 --> 19:58.293
that our alma maters are headed..."

19:58.317 --> 19:59.361
Keep it simple.

19:59.385 --> 20:01.596
"Nebraska's playing at Rutgers Thursday.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.399
Wanna go with me?"

20:04.423 --> 20:05.901
- Smiley face.
- No smiley faces.

20:05.925 --> 20:07.457
Too late. Sent.

20:08.460 --> 20:09.938
She's typing.

20:09.962 --> 20:11.239
The dots are moving.

20:11.263 --> 20:13.275
Back and forth, back and forth,
back and forth...

20:13.299 --> 20:15.677
How about I just assume the dots are
moving unless you say otherwise.

20:16.669 --> 20:17.950
She's in.

20:18.737 --> 20:20.448
I have a date.

20:20.472 --> 20:21.917
That's great, man.

20:21.941 --> 20:23.685
♪ If I were a rich man ♪

20:23.709 --> 20:26.621
♪ Daidle deedle daidle deedle
deedle deedle daidle dumb ♪

20:26.645 --> 20:27.856
You ruined it. Get out of my office.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.079
Yeah, sorry.

20:33.218 --> 20:35.230
Ms. Lee, what was your
relationship with Ms. Mason?

20:35.254 --> 20:36.464
I'm her roommate.

20:36.488 --> 20:38.700
I was her roommate, excuse me.

20:38.724 --> 20:39.935
Are you familiar with someone

20:39.960 --> 20:41.870
- by the name of Hank Porter?
- Yes.

20:41.894 --> 20:44.272
What was the relationship
between Ellie and Hank?

20:44.296 --> 20:45.774
Relationship? They went on one date.

20:45.798 --> 20:46.875
She told me he was a creeper.

20:46.899 --> 20:47.876
Objection. Hearsay.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.578
I'm sorry. He was a total creeper.

20:49.602 --> 20:50.946
Uh, Ms. Lee.

20:50.970 --> 20:52.881
At some point, did Ms. Mason ask you

20:52.905 --> 20:54.523
to help her deal with Hank?

20:54.547 --> 20:55.884
Yes. She had me change

20:55.908 --> 20:57.252
all of her social media settings
to private

20:57.276 --> 20:58.847
so he couldn't find out
anything about her.

20:58.871 --> 21:01.423
And she asked me to talk to the
doorman of our building about him.

21:01.447 --> 21:02.490
She was scared of him.

21:02.514 --> 21:03.758
Did you provide this information

21:03.782 --> 21:05.794
to Detective Blake of the NYPD?

21:05.818 --> 21:06.828
Yes, all of it.

21:06.852 --> 21:08.763
Did he ever follow up with you about it?

21:08.787 --> 21:10.298
No, he did not.

21:10.322 --> 21:12.801
Agent Cho, you recovered
the text messages

21:12.825 --> 21:14.903
- off Ms. Mason's phone, correct?
- Yes.

21:14.927 --> 21:17.606
And you've had the opportunity
to review those messages,

21:17.630 --> 21:20.931
including messages between
Ms. Mason and Hank Porter,

21:20.955 --> 21:22.711
- correct?
- Yes, I have.

21:22.735 --> 21:25.880
How many times did Hank Porter
text Ellie Mason?

21:25.904 --> 21:27.215
227 times.

21:27.239 --> 21:29.217
And how many times did Ellie Mason

21:29.241 --> 21:30.552
respond to those texts?

21:30.576 --> 21:31.953
She never responded.

21:31.977 --> 21:34.022
- Not once?
- No.

21:34.046 --> 21:36.257
You were a close friend
of Ms. Mason, correct?

21:36.281 --> 21:37.392
She was my best friend.

21:37.416 --> 21:39.219
And you were with Ms. Mason
the night of the concert

21:39.243 --> 21:41.096
- on Governor's Island?
- Yes.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.098
Prior to Ms. Mason leaving the festival,

21:43.122 --> 21:44.733
did she say anything unusual to you?

21:44.757 --> 21:46.468
She told me that there was a guy

21:46.492 --> 21:47.969
who she had gone on a date with

21:47.993 --> 21:50.071
who she saw staring at her
during the festival.

21:50.095 --> 21:52.307
- Did she indicate who that was?
- Yes.

21:52.331 --> 21:53.775
She said his name was Hank Porter.

21:53.799 --> 21:55.677
Did you see Mr. Porter yourself?

21:55.701 --> 21:56.978
Yes, I did.

21:57.002 --> 21:59.547
How would you describe
his physical appearance?

21:59.571 --> 22:01.082
Huge.

22:01.106 --> 22:03.618
He was, like, a really big guy...

22:03.642 --> 22:06.054
6'4" maybe, 240 pounds.

22:06.078 --> 22:08.356
Ms. Womack, how did Ellie Mason die?

22:08.380 --> 22:09.724
Manual strangulation.

22:09.748 --> 22:12.260
Was there anything unusual
about the strangulation?

22:12.284 --> 22:13.595
Her hyoid bone was shattered,

22:13.619 --> 22:16.364
and her laryngeal cartilage
was completely crushed.

22:16.388 --> 22:17.465
You don't see that often.

22:17.489 --> 22:20.435
Is it difficult to crush
laryngeal cartilage?

22:20.459 --> 22:23.438
Extremely because you need
sustained, strong contact

22:23.462 --> 22:25.073
between the hands and the victim's neck.

22:25.097 --> 22:26.775
In your expert opinion,

22:26.799 --> 22:30.779
could a man approximately
5'8", 140 pounds,

22:30.803 --> 22:33.682
inflict the injuries that
caused Ms. Mason's death?

22:33.706 --> 22:34.849
No.

22:34.873 --> 22:37.760
It would require extraordinary
size and strength.

22:37.784 --> 22:39.543
Thank you, Ms. Womack.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.591
Okay, Doug, Agent Cheng
will walk you through

22:43.615 --> 22:45.326
everything you'll do at the conference.

22:45.350 --> 22:48.063
This is a very simple, safe operation.

22:48.087 --> 22:48.997
You'll just meet with your buyer...

22:49.021 --> 22:50.932
Jerome. Super-nice guy.

22:50.956 --> 22:52.396
He has a boat.

22:53.192 --> 22:55.036
Uh, you'll meet with Jerome,

22:55.060 --> 22:57.439
like you always do, and make the sale.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.773
Okay.

22:58.797 --> 23:00.775
What if he makes me take off my shirt?

23:00.799 --> 23:02.043
Why would he do that, Doug?

23:02.067 --> 23:03.278
In the mob movies,

23:03.302 --> 23:04.512
guys always make you take off your shirt,

23:04.536 --> 23:05.847
show you're not wearing a wire.

23:05.871 --> 23:07.682
I don't think he's going
to be suspicious, Doug.

23:07.706 --> 23:10.518
He knows you. Don't worry.

23:10.542 --> 23:12.787
You'll be there, right? At the hotel?

23:12.811 --> 23:15.023
Uh, defense lawyers don't come on stings.

23:15.047 --> 23:16.324
But... But she's the one I know.

23:16.348 --> 23:17.726
- I trust her.
- I'll be there.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.227
Yeah, but you scare me.

23:19.251 --> 23:22.230
- I can't... I can't...
- It will all be okay, Doug.

23:22.254 --> 23:25.266
I promise. Just breathe.
Listen to my voice.

23:25.290 --> 23:27.635
Say something real casual like,

23:27.659 --> 23:31.239
"Hey, so Pete Dolan tells me
you and him go way back!"

23:31.263 --> 23:32.540
Hey...

23:32.564 --> 23:34.931
So Pete Dolan tells me
you and him go way back.

23:37.369 --> 23:38.513
She can come.

23:38.537 --> 23:40.615
What?! To a...
To a body parts convention?

23:40.639 --> 23:42.484
- No, no, no, no, no, no way.
- This is not a good idea.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.319
Mr. Bradshaw obviously needs her there,

23:44.343 --> 23:45.876
or this is never gonna work.

23:50.382 --> 23:53.228
Okay! We're all going to Secaucus.

23:53.252 --> 23:55.125
You pick up the rooms, right?

24:00.356 --> 24:02.204
Your guy's killing me.

24:02.228 --> 24:04.636
- He'll be here.
- He's 45 minutes late.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.693
He's coming.

24:07.683 --> 24:09.516
At an hour, we're getting a warrant.

24:10.933 --> 24:12.933
Uh, uh...

24:22.390 --> 24:23.968
There's a pool.

24:23.993 --> 24:25.103
How is it?

24:25.489 --> 24:27.762
Pretty good. Nice.

24:31.462 --> 24:32.606
When I was in elementary school,

24:32.630 --> 24:35.075
my dad and I used to sneak
into the Sandman Inn

24:35.099 --> 24:36.777
during the summer.

24:36.801 --> 24:39.180
Summer in Sacramento, you know?

24:39.204 --> 24:41.115
I can tell you this, right?

24:41.139 --> 24:42.716
Out of my jurisdiction.

24:42.740 --> 24:43.805
We had a little routine.

24:43.829 --> 24:45.486
We'd get a floatie at Safeway,

24:45.510 --> 24:47.555
one large box of Junior Mints,

24:47.579 --> 24:50.324
two plastic water guns.

24:50.348 --> 24:52.393
I'd go first, stand by the gate,

24:52.417 --> 24:54.361
someone would let me in...

24:54.385 --> 24:56.530
I'd look around, scout it out,

24:56.554 --> 24:57.631
then come back and grab my dad.

24:57.655 --> 24:59.166
We had a room number we would use

24:59.190 --> 25:00.734
in case anyone ever asked.

25:00.758 --> 25:02.436
1342.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.871
We were the Carlyles

25:03.895 --> 25:05.372
'cause my dad thought
that sounded rich...

25:05.396 --> 25:07.990
the Carlyles from Chicago.

25:11.102 --> 25:14.770
I thought that was the most
beautiful pool in the world.

25:17.242 --> 25:18.941
Until this one.

25:21.512 --> 25:23.512
You really need a vacation.

25:25.783 --> 25:27.328
I do.

25:27.611 --> 25:29.344
Don't you?

25:34.692 --> 25:37.137
I am so sorry I'm late, guys.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.740
- Uh, what's in the cooler?
- The merchandise.

25:39.764 --> 25:40.875
Well, I mean, the torsos
are still in the truck.

25:40.899 --> 25:41.876
They get bulky.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.244
This isn't a real sale, Doug.

25:43.268 --> 25:45.279
You didn't need to bring
actual body parts.

25:45.303 --> 25:47.448
Nope, nope, no, you did not.

25:47.472 --> 25:49.817
Oh, shoot, that makes sense.

25:49.841 --> 25:51.218
Whole thing's a bust anyway.

25:51.242 --> 25:53.187
His dealer already left.

25:53.211 --> 25:55.656
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.359
Ah, I had some nervous tummy stuff.

25:58.383 --> 25:59.760
And then when I got here,

25:59.784 --> 26:01.829
I ran into Frank and Rich then Jeff...

26:01.853 --> 26:03.731
Like, everyone I ever worked for is here.

26:03.755 --> 26:05.532
And they're such nice guys,
I had to catch up.

26:05.556 --> 26:06.767
Worked for? In what capacity?

26:06.791 --> 26:08.235
Well, like Frank, I...

26:08.259 --> 26:09.970
he has this national chain
of funeral homes

26:09.994 --> 26:11.438
I used to sell parts for,

26:11.462 --> 26:13.140
and Rich runs a donor network

26:13.164 --> 26:14.909
that gives people free cremation services

26:14.933 --> 26:16.277
in exchange for the bodies.

26:16.301 --> 26:18.779
You did the same thing
for these other people?

26:18.803 --> 26:21.548
Took body parts and sold them
across state lines

26:21.572 --> 26:22.783
for cashier's checks?

26:22.807 --> 26:24.585
Yeah, I mean, that's how
I've always done it.

26:24.609 --> 26:27.254
20 years in this business,
so many places.

26:27.278 --> 26:29.478
Doug. Stop talking. Now.

26:30.949 --> 26:32.760
Full dismissal of charges against him

26:32.784 --> 26:35.162
and we can help you get
whoever you want here.

26:35.186 --> 26:36.752
Full dismissal.

26:40.825 --> 26:42.202
Wire him up.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.437
Whoo-hoo!

26:45.496 --> 26:47.541
Poor Rich and Frank, though.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.510
Just... They're super-nice guys.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.251
Ready for your date tonight?

26:57.275 --> 26:58.319
It's off.

26:58.343 --> 26:59.987
What? What happened? What did you do?

27:00.011 --> 27:01.789
Why do you immediately assume
I did something?

27:01.813 --> 27:03.257
- Did you sing?
- Sing?

27:03.281 --> 27:05.259
You sent her something.
What did you send her?

27:05.283 --> 27:06.460
I sent her a puppy.

27:06.484 --> 27:08.028
No! I didn't sing!

27:08.052 --> 27:09.663
I didn't send her anything.
I'm telling you.

27:09.687 --> 27:11.665
She just texted, "Something came up."

27:11.689 --> 27:13.734
I asked her about rescheduling.
She hasn't responded.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.803
- Sorry, man.
- It's cool.

27:15.827 --> 27:17.538
I'll be alone forever.

27:17.562 --> 27:19.173
I like being alone.

27:19.197 --> 27:21.208
I can set the thermostat at
whatever temperature I like.

27:21.232 --> 27:23.410
Dude, it's one girl, one date.
On to the next.

27:23.434 --> 27:26.013
I'll take a pass.
I get enough rejection here.

27:26.037 --> 27:27.614
Last thing I need is more failure.

27:27.638 --> 27:30.417
This isn't a failure. I was there.
She was into you.

27:30.441 --> 27:32.086
It doesn't matter it makes
no sense to me, it's true.

27:32.110 --> 27:33.420
Take what she said at face value.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.089
Maybe she'll reschedule, maybe she won't.

27:35.113 --> 27:36.824
You put yourself out there.

27:36.848 --> 27:38.192
That's a success.

27:38.216 --> 27:39.860
I appreciate that, I do,

27:39.884 --> 27:41.362
but I'm trying to feel sorry
for myself, so...

27:41.386 --> 27:43.464
All right, that's enough. You, me.

27:43.488 --> 27:46.233
5:00. Cornhuskers...

27:46.257 --> 27:48.724
or whatever the hell they're called.

27:53.164 --> 27:55.275
I mean, three arrests,

27:55.299 --> 27:57.177
you got leads on four other suppliers.

27:57.201 --> 27:59.780
It was a good day. I'm happy.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.782
Well, I don't usually
enjoy that in a prosecutor,

28:01.806 --> 28:04.084
but those aren't my clients.

28:04.108 --> 28:05.419
I don't think.

28:05.443 --> 28:06.820
Yet.

28:06.844 --> 28:08.956
You heading back in?
We could share a car.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.024
You probably have a car,

28:10.048 --> 28:11.825
like, a police car or something.

28:11.849 --> 28:13.594
It's not really like that, but...

28:13.618 --> 28:14.661
I forgot something upstairs.

28:14.685 --> 28:16.063
You should go ahead.

28:16.087 --> 28:18.265
Oh. Okay. Well...

28:18.289 --> 28:20.267
Until our next fight to the death.

28:52.857 --> 28:54.056
Phew.

29:06.044 --> 29:07.588
One hour.

29:07.772 --> 29:10.717
We deserve it. Someday we'll be dead.

29:10.741 --> 29:12.653
And people will turn us
into dental paste.

29:12.677 --> 29:14.254
We should enjoy ourselves a little

29:14.278 --> 29:15.689
while we're still barely alive.

29:15.713 --> 29:18.714
Get a little sun on our fibulas
while they're young.

29:20.351 --> 29:23.397
It's okay to pretend, Mrs. Carlyle.

29:26.524 --> 29:27.730
One hour.

29:32.130 --> 29:33.574
Here is the evidence

29:33.598 --> 29:36.842
that Steve Caldwell murdered Ellie Mason.

29:37.702 --> 29:39.011
A confession.

29:39.604 --> 29:40.929
That is it.

29:41.372 --> 29:43.098
There is nothing else.

29:43.407 --> 29:46.286
There are no witnesses, there is no DNA,

29:46.310 --> 29:48.689
no fingerprints, no hair, no blood.

29:48.713 --> 29:50.524
There is no motive.

29:50.548 --> 29:52.441
There is nothing.

29:53.317 --> 29:55.262
There is evidence in this case.

29:55.286 --> 29:57.631
Let's be clear.
There is a lot of evidence.

29:57.655 --> 30:00.067
But that evidence points to Hank Porter.

30:00.091 --> 30:02.002
He was on the island that night.

30:02.026 --> 30:04.004
He had a disturbing history

30:04.028 --> 30:07.074
of aggressively harassing Ms. Mason.

30:07.098 --> 30:10.918
He had the strength to kill Ms. Mason.

30:11.636 --> 30:16.416
Why didn't Detective Blake
pursue Mr. Porter?

30:16.440 --> 30:19.551
Because he got to Steve Caldwell first.

30:20.545 --> 30:23.056
Because Steve Caldwell
seemed "suspicious."

30:23.080 --> 30:26.660
Because Steve Caldwell's
reaction was "odd."

30:27.100 --> 30:28.462
That's it.

30:28.486 --> 30:31.331
And once Detective Blake
brought Mr. Caldwell in,

30:31.355 --> 30:32.799
his mind was made up,

30:32.823 --> 30:34.801
and he was going to get his confession.

30:34.825 --> 30:36.109
And he did.

30:37.181 --> 30:40.294
And this is where we are now...
with a confession.

30:40.319 --> 30:41.896
That is all there is.

30:41.999 --> 30:45.786
How could someone confess to
a crime he did not commit?

30:46.304 --> 30:48.372
I know that is hard for you. I know.

30:48.906 --> 30:51.018
I could tell you about the conditions

30:51.042 --> 30:53.120
of that interrogation,
and that is important.

30:53.144 --> 30:54.688
That is critical.

30:54.712 --> 30:58.192
I could tell you about Steve,
and that, too, is critical.

30:58.216 --> 30:59.526
But none of this will matter

30:59.550 --> 31:02.462
unless you believe this is possible...

31:02.486 --> 31:04.865
that someone, anyone,

31:04.889 --> 31:07.568
could confess to something he did not do.

31:07.592 --> 31:09.536
And I think you can believe this.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.471
I think you should,

31:11.495 --> 31:13.647
because a false confession

31:14.232 --> 31:16.643
is just a more extraordinary version

31:16.667 --> 31:18.879
of what so many of us do all the time.

31:18.903 --> 31:21.029
It's simply a lie.

31:22.340 --> 31:25.219
It is self-deception.

31:25.243 --> 31:29.056
If you've ever thought to
yourself, "Why did I say that,

31:29.080 --> 31:30.924
why did I agree to that,

31:30.948 --> 31:32.459
how could I be so gullible,"

31:32.483 --> 31:34.628
then you can believe this.

31:34.652 --> 31:35.929
If you've ever wondered why

31:35.953 --> 31:38.599
you stayed in a job you didn't like,

31:38.623 --> 31:41.201
a marriage that wasn't working,

31:41.225 --> 31:43.971
a relationship that was abusive,

31:43.995 --> 31:45.772
then you can understand this.

31:45.796 --> 31:47.441
We convince ourselves all the time

31:47.465 --> 31:51.478
that things are true
that we know are not true

31:51.502 --> 31:53.847
because it eases some pain,

31:53.871 --> 31:56.717
because we're confused,

31:56.741 --> 32:00.954
because we are tired or frustrated,

32:00.978 --> 32:04.573
because we think,
in the long run, it's better,

32:06.423 --> 32:09.035
because insisting on the truth

32:09.060 --> 32:11.794
sometimes becomes too difficult to bear.

32:14.892 --> 32:18.572
If you can understand that, you
can believe this. You can.

32:18.596 --> 32:20.140
And if you can believe this,

32:20.164 --> 32:24.244
you can stop this because
it's happening again right now.

32:24.268 --> 32:27.679
His false confession will be your burden.

32:28.639 --> 32:30.039
Don't let it be.

32:32.677 --> 32:34.288
Tell the truth.

32:47.544 --> 32:49.021
You're still here?

32:49.045 --> 32:50.256
I guess I am.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.324
I mean, I am.

32:51.348 --> 32:53.626
Yes. I am here.

32:53.650 --> 32:56.062
Feels weird to go home while
the jury is still out.

32:56.086 --> 32:57.930
What should we do?

32:57.954 --> 32:59.554
We could clean Sandra's office.

33:00.824 --> 33:03.336
Jury will definitely be back
before you finish that.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.570
You're still here, too?

33:04.594 --> 33:05.705
I guess I am.

33:05.729 --> 33:07.640
I also had trouble with that question.

33:07.664 --> 33:09.075
What are you doing?

33:09.099 --> 33:11.144
I am going to drink.

33:11.168 --> 33:13.079
That seems like something to do.

33:13.103 --> 33:14.392
What are you doing?

33:15.605 --> 33:17.116
D-Drinking.

33:17.140 --> 33:19.352
Here? In the office?

33:19.376 --> 33:21.521
We were anxious. It was Ted's idea.

33:21.545 --> 33:23.678
This is not a place to drink.

33:26.550 --> 33:27.948
This...

33:28.685 --> 33:30.563
This is a place to drink.

33:30.587 --> 33:32.198
We have a rooftop?

33:32.222 --> 33:34.100
A War Room, rooftop...

33:34.124 --> 33:35.868
what else are we going
to learn on this case?

33:35.892 --> 33:38.237
When I worked for Cordyn & Walsh,

33:38.261 --> 33:39.939
we used to have these rooftop parties

33:39.963 --> 33:42.475
for new summer associates
right over there.

33:43.046 --> 33:45.077
Probably why I avoid the roof.

33:45.101 --> 33:47.613
- You worked for Cordyn & Walsh?
- Yes.

33:47.637 --> 33:48.748
- A firm?
- Yes.

33:48.772 --> 33:50.349
- A private firm?
- Yes.

33:50.373 --> 33:53.014
For four years, right out of law school.

33:53.443 --> 33:56.556
I was on the fast track to partner

33:56.580 --> 33:58.858
and a lot of money.

33:58.882 --> 34:02.128
I was married, took fancy trips...

34:02.152 --> 34:04.030
Did we drink another bottle inside

34:04.054 --> 34:05.264
and I don't remember?

34:05.288 --> 34:06.654
What happened?

34:09.192 --> 34:12.471
I was in a conference room
with four other associates

34:12.495 --> 34:15.141
on this big airline antitrust case.

34:15.165 --> 34:18.610
We'd been up for 56 hours,
preparing a deposition outline

34:18.635 --> 34:21.380
for our client's Chief Financial Officer,

34:21.404 --> 34:23.449
and I walked into the bathroom,

34:23.473 --> 34:26.589
looked at myself in the
mirror, and I thought,

34:27.344 --> 34:28.842
"Where did you go?"

34:30.112 --> 34:31.657
That was it.

34:31.681 --> 34:32.725
It was all a lie.

34:32.748 --> 34:35.094
I was lying to myself about who I was,

34:35.118 --> 34:36.996
what I wanted my life to be.

34:37.020 --> 34:40.800
And I left the bathroom,
and I stopped lying.

34:48.130 --> 34:50.810
Go... Huskers?

34:50.833 --> 34:52.304
That works. Sure.

34:52.329 --> 34:54.045
You just tell me if I'm
supposed to throw something

34:54.070 --> 34:55.281
or look upset or whatever.

34:55.304 --> 34:56.337
I got you.

34:57.907 --> 35:00.920
So, what about you?

35:00.944 --> 35:02.121
What about me?

35:02.145 --> 35:04.090
You seeing anyone?

35:04.114 --> 35:05.291
We're here for you.

35:05.315 --> 35:07.526
You used to go on a date every night.

35:07.550 --> 35:08.761
Who told you that?

35:08.785 --> 35:09.895
Kate.

35:09.919 --> 35:12.298
Kate doesn't know what
she's talking about.

35:12.322 --> 35:13.499
Do you ever think about that?

35:13.523 --> 35:14.767
All the time.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.858
Do you ever think about... Kate?

35:18.962 --> 35:20.239
You're drunk.

35:20.263 --> 35:22.630
I'm just finishing my first beer.

35:25.068 --> 35:26.679
So, yes, I am. Very.

35:29.773 --> 35:31.584
I chose Texas.

35:36.379 --> 35:37.523
What are you doing?

35:37.547 --> 35:39.892
- Pick it up!
- Ah!

35:39.916 --> 35:41.093
Hey.

35:41.117 --> 35:43.750
Yeah, no problem. I understand.

35:44.220 --> 35:45.631
Saturday?

35:45.655 --> 35:47.700
Sure. I-I'm around.

35:47.724 --> 35:49.089
Great.

35:49.526 --> 35:51.758
Of course I can bring a deck of cards.

35:53.396 --> 35:54.974
Thanks for calling.

35:54.998 --> 35:56.698
You, too. Bye.

35:59.469 --> 36:01.575
Do not bring the deck of cards.

36:21.057 --> 36:22.523
The jury's back.

36:24.527 --> 36:25.793
Right now?

36:27.597 --> 36:31.840
Whatever happens,
I'm gonna stay with you.

36:32.635 --> 36:34.268
Okay, Steve?

36:37.407 --> 36:39.472
When I was in junior high,

36:40.710 --> 36:44.590
my stepdad used to beat me
every day after school.

36:44.614 --> 36:45.937
Every day.

36:46.449 --> 36:49.628
A belt, an iron,

36:49.652 --> 36:52.698
a flashlight, one of my sister's dolls,

36:52.722 --> 36:54.734
whatever he could get his hands on.

36:54.758 --> 36:59.805
And s-sometimes he would mumble
something about disrespect,

36:59.829 --> 37:03.409
but usually he would just start swinging.

37:03.433 --> 37:05.411
And then, when it was finished,

37:05.435 --> 37:07.792
he always said the same thing...

37:09.305 --> 37:11.171
"You understand?

37:11.808 --> 37:14.642
You understand why you needed that?"

37:20.049 --> 37:22.223
And I would say, "Yes, sir.

37:23.853 --> 37:27.155
I understand, sir."

37:29.426 --> 37:30.992
And I never did.

37:37.801 --> 37:39.979
I did not kill that girl.

37:48.278 --> 37:50.189
Madam Foreperson,

37:50.213 --> 37:52.892
I understand you've reached
a unanimous verdict.

37:52.916 --> 37:54.464
Yes, Your Honor.

37:56.119 --> 37:59.331
In the matter of
United States v. Steve Caldwell,

37:59.355 --> 38:02.435
how do you find the defendant
on count one of the indictment,

38:02.459 --> 38:05.693
murder in the first degree,
guilty or not guilty?

38:07.810 --> 38:09.542
Guilty.

39:42.859 --> 39:45.070
You fought for him.

39:45.094 --> 39:48.429
You went to war for him.
You fought for the truth.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.844
Be proud.

40:05.582 --> 40:07.226
- You okay?
- Yes.

40:07.250 --> 40:09.061
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

40:09.085 --> 40:10.596
- I don't mean talk about it.
- I know what you mean,

40:10.620 --> 40:11.897
and I don't want to talk about it

40:11.921 --> 40:14.366
because talking about my work
reminds me about your work,

40:14.390 --> 40:15.668
and I don't like that part of you.

40:19.295 --> 40:20.839
I like the Roger Gunn

40:20.863 --> 40:23.108
that watches bad foreign films,

40:23.132 --> 40:25.611
tells me funny stories
about your daughters,

40:25.635 --> 40:27.346
that knows that the only Yankee

40:27.370 --> 40:29.548
to get four home runs in a single game is

40:29.572 --> 40:30.871
- Lou Gehrig.
- Lou Gehrig.

40:32.442 --> 40:35.654
I like the part of you
that reads weird, little books

40:35.678 --> 40:38.724
about random, obscure topics
I've never even heard of

40:38.748 --> 40:41.594
and then is so excited
to share it all with me.

40:42.507 --> 40:45.230
Roger Gunn the prosecutor?

40:45.254 --> 40:46.632
I like to pretend he doesn't exist.

40:46.656 --> 40:48.000
That's my magic trick.

40:48.024 --> 40:49.401
Well, I'm offended by that.

40:51.894 --> 40:53.339
They're not weird, little books.

40:54.430 --> 40:56.342
Perfectly sized. See?

41:00.803 --> 41:04.149
101 Cunning Stratagems
to Reduce Dramatically

41:04.173 --> 41:06.251
the Egregious Misappropriation of Seed

41:06.275 --> 41:07.853
From Your Bird Feeder by Squirrels."

41:09.178 --> 41:11.744
Over 1 million squirrels outwitted.

41:12.482 --> 41:14.159
Squirrels are really
a problem in your life?

41:14.183 --> 41:15.527
Well, not anymore.
