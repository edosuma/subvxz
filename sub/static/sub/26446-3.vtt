WEBVTT

00:03.172 --> 00:06.927
Okay, Mr. Donaldson,
It looks like you are all set

00:06.928 --> 00:07.991
and ready to go.

00:09.594 --> 00:13.296
Okay, man, uh, look, I know
I look a little too happy.

00:13.297 --> 00:15.265
I'm just too happy.

00:15.266 --> 00:16.666
You know, considering your situation.

00:16.667 --> 00:20.437
Uh... but this weekend
is gonna be insane

00:20.438 --> 00:22.973
because it's the first weekend
that my babies

00:22.974 --> 00:25.609
are coming to hang out with me
since me and my wife split.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.511
So I'm excited to see
their little faces

00:27.512 --> 00:29.279
and give them hugs and kisses.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.614
Oh, man. You know something?

00:30.615 --> 00:33.984
I hope you have a great weekend,
too. You know...

00:33.985 --> 00:35.819
but if you don't make it
through the weekend,

00:35.820 --> 00:38.522
I hope you have an amazing
afterlife.

00:38.523 --> 00:40.090
All right, Mr. Donaldson.

00:40.091 --> 00:41.925
Take care.

00:41.926 --> 00:44.628
Rel.

00:44.629 --> 00:46.163
Where in the hell
you think you're going?

00:46.164 --> 00:49.766
Uh...

00:49.767 --> 00:54.137
Okay, so, yeah,
I thought you was, um...

00:54.138 --> 00:55.472
okay, look, um...

00:55.473 --> 00:57.774
I'm-a just go home 'cause I,
you know, I want to see my kids

00:57.775 --> 00:59.276
and you ain't got
nothing to worry about.

00:59.277 --> 01:01.011
Karen is about to come in
so you'll be fine.

01:01.012 --> 01:02.345
Hell no.

01:02.346 --> 01:04.480
You gon' stay right here.

01:04.482 --> 01:06.616
Sit your black ass down.

01:08.519 --> 01:12.322
I flew with the Tuskegee
Airmen for 13 years.

01:12.323 --> 01:15.525
Be damned if I'm-a die with some...

01:15.526 --> 01:19.930
some strange white woman
named Karen holding my hand.

01:21.899 --> 01:23.700
All right.

01:23.701 --> 01:25.302
I'll stay.

01:25.303 --> 01:27.204
I'm-a let you know this:

01:27.205 --> 01:30.473
that's one racist-ass final wish.

01:34.979 --> 01:36.680
Quick question.

01:36.681 --> 01:37.814
Huh?

01:37.815 --> 01:41.184
How long do you think
you actually got?

01:41.185 --> 01:46.223
About 45 minutes, an hour or so.

01:46.224 --> 01:49.025
I could do that.

01:51.662 --> 01:53.263
♪ This how we do it in the Chi

Oh. Did that Tuskegee Airman dude die?

02:06.844 --> 02:09.012
Yeah, it took awhile,
but he out of there.

02:10.615 --> 02:12.849
Turns out he wasn't
even a Tuskegee Airman.

02:12.850 --> 02:15.118
This dude was just an extra
in the movie <i>Red Tails.</i>

02:16.521 --> 02:18.555
Are the kids asleep?

02:18.556 --> 02:19.890
Yeah, they were real, real tired.

02:19.891 --> 02:21.458
Oh, cool. Let me go say
good night to them.

02:21.459 --> 02:23.193
Rel, please don't wake them up.
Come on now.

02:23.194 --> 02:24.728
Okay, look, I haven't seen
my kids in a minute.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.429
I just want to kiss them good night.

02:26.430 --> 02:27.898
All right. Do what you want.

02:27.899 --> 02:31.067
I'm just they godmother.
They ain't my kids.

02:32.904 --> 02:35.605
Oh, my babies are back.

02:35.606 --> 02:38.074
Oh, I miss you so much.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.744
Good night.

02:40.745 --> 02:41.978
Hey, little man.

02:41.979 --> 02:44.381
Good night.

02:46.918 --> 02:48.451
Dad?

02:48.452 --> 02:49.819
Oh, hey, hey, Terry.

02:49.820 --> 02:52.889
I didn't mean to wake you up, man.

02:52.890 --> 02:54.791
Look, I'm sorry
for coming home late tonight

02:54.792 --> 02:57.594
and-and I didn't pick you guys
up from the airport, okay?

02:57.595 --> 02:59.095
That's my bad.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.797
It's okay, Dad.

03:00.798 --> 03:03.566
I'm used to not seeing you, anyway.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.871
Good night.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.576
What was that?

03:18.182 --> 03:22.118
Terry. Terry.

03:30.628 --> 03:33.163
I shouldn't have went in there.

03:33.164 --> 03:34.297
What's wrong?

03:34.298 --> 03:37.500
So, look, I went to kiss
the babies good night, right?

03:37.501 --> 03:40.003
And Terry woke up,

03:40.004 --> 03:41.438
you know, and I was like,

03:41.439 --> 03:43.340
"Oh, man, I'm sorry
for coming home late"

03:43.341 --> 03:45.342
He was like, "It's okay, Dad.

03:45.343 --> 03:48.378
I'm used to not seeing you, anyway."

03:48.379 --> 03:50.647
Oh, okay.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.649
You think this look
like a Batmobile or...

03:52.650 --> 03:53.783
I don't know what this is.

03:53.784 --> 03:56.152
Did you hear what I just said?

03:56.153 --> 03:59.823
My son just told me
he's used to not seeing me.

03:59.824 --> 04:01.625
I mean, what does that even mean?

04:01.626 --> 04:04.694
I mean, I FaceTime him every day
so he does see me.

04:04.695 --> 04:07.697
Rel, he probably means
you're not physically there.

04:07.698 --> 04:09.165
You know, it's like a dead person.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.168
They with you,
but they ain't with you.

04:12.169 --> 04:15.205
You get what I'm saying?

04:15.206 --> 04:17.173
You think this go on
the other side or other side?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.209
Okay, could you put down
the damn toy? Okay?

04:19.209 --> 04:20.709
And I know what it means.

04:20.711 --> 04:21.978
So then what you ask me for then?

04:21.978 --> 04:23.546
You know I hate rhetorical questions.

04:23.547 --> 04:26.750
Damn. Now, look, Rel,
you fine. Just chill.

04:26.751 --> 04:28.218
Okay, you wouldn't even understand.

04:28.219 --> 04:29.252
Okay? You're not a parent.

04:29.253 --> 04:30.587
Look, I may not have kids,

04:30.588 --> 04:32.088
but I do a lot of parenting, okay?

04:32.089 --> 04:35.058
Whenever I see a child in need
of guidance, I step in.

04:35.059 --> 04:37.994
I'm a vigilante parent.

04:37.995 --> 04:40.063
Look, just 'cause you yell
at random kids

04:40.064 --> 04:42.666
doesn't make you a vigilante parent.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.334
I don't just yell.

04:44.335 --> 04:47.337
Look, yesterday, I caught a kid
throwing a rock at a car, right?

04:47.338 --> 04:49.706
I tied him to a tree.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.842
Guess what he stopped doing?

04:52.843 --> 04:55.111
Breathing?

04:56.914 --> 04:59.215
Look, you don't understand.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.117
I need to make new
memories with my kids.

05:01.118 --> 05:03.687
I'm already a fading
presence in their lives.

05:03.688 --> 05:05.255
I got to make this weekend memorable.

05:05.256 --> 05:07.424
That means I got to do something
they never done before.

05:07.425 --> 05:10.226
I know what I'll do.
I'll take them to Six Flags.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.961
What? Rel, they are too small.

05:11.962 --> 05:14.030
They can't even get on
the rides. You barely can.

05:14.031 --> 05:18.068
Nah, nah, nope. This is a great idea.

05:18.069 --> 05:21.304
They have never been before and
we gon' make some memories.

05:21.305 --> 05:23.940
This is so exciting.

05:23.941 --> 05:25.775
I mean, them kids are gonna
be so happy they gonna wish

05:25.776 --> 05:27.436
me and they mama
was divorced years ago.

05:30.581 --> 05:35.118
Talking about it
wasn't gonna rain today.

05:35.119 --> 05:38.488
Dumb-ass weatherman.

05:38.489 --> 05:41.725
One good thing about the rain:

05:41.726 --> 05:43.259
I get to wear this coat.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.096
This a nice-ass coat.

05:46.097 --> 05:47.297
You seen this coat?

05:47.298 --> 05:48.598
Have I shown y'all this coat?

05:48.599 --> 05:50.100
Dad, you've had the coat for 15 years.

05:50.101 --> 05:54.070
Ooh. This is nice, though.
Is it Kente cloth?

05:54.071 --> 05:56.139
Yes, girl. Got this in Detroit.

05:56.140 --> 05:57.307
Nigerian sister had a shop there.

05:57.308 --> 05:58.975
She used to sell jewelry
and all kinds of stuff...

05:58.976 --> 06:01.177
Okay, Dad, would you shut
up about the damn coat?

06:01.178 --> 06:04.147
You all right?

06:04.148 --> 06:06.683
Okay, Dad, look, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

06:06.684 --> 06:08.418
look, I'm just a little frustrated

06:08.419 --> 06:10.954
'cause it's the kids'
first weekend with me

06:10.955 --> 06:12.856
and so far it's ruined, you know?

06:12.857 --> 06:14.190
We were supposed
to go to Six Flags today

06:14.191 --> 06:15.625
and now the weather's all terrible.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.260
Those plans are gone.

06:17.261 --> 06:19.629
I feel like the worst father
in the world.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.598
I got to think
of something else to do.

06:21.599 --> 06:23.166
Yo, me and the kids are getting bored,

06:23.167 --> 06:24.768
so I'm-a show them some Cardi B videos

06:24.769 --> 06:26.336
till y'all figure out where we going.

06:26.337 --> 06:28.938
Hey, hey. No Cardi B.
You see what I'm saying?

06:28.939 --> 06:30.707
Look, I got to figure out
something quick.

06:30.752 --> 06:32.272
Well, you know, there's

06:32.273 --> 06:33.479
- the Museum of Science...
- No.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.045
- All right, we've got the Museum of...
- No.

06:36.046 --> 06:38.882
Okay? A fun memory has never
been created at a museum.

06:38.883 --> 06:40.950
He's right.

06:40.951 --> 06:42.352
You can't have fun at a museum.

06:42.353 --> 06:44.053
I mean, you go in there,
everybody got to be quiet,

06:44.054 --> 06:45.488
you look around, "Oh, that's nice.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.958
Ooh, hat... ooh. That's nice."

06:51.829 --> 06:53.563
Well, that's the only thing coming up

06:53.564 --> 06:55.131
for indoor good times on Google.

06:55.132 --> 06:56.499
No, no, see, you don't
know how to Google stuff.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.867
That's your problem.

06:57.868 --> 07:00.036
When you Google, you got
to be really specific

07:00.037 --> 07:01.838
about what you want.
See, look. Watch this.

07:01.839 --> 07:06.910
"Indoor amusement parks...

07:06.911 --> 07:10.346

I think that was K-Ci & JoJo.

it looked perfect.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.883
No. Nuh-uh, hold up.
They were singing too high.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.232
Rel, you sure this is the right place?

08:36.232 --> 08:41.004
I think this is it, but where
is the indoor rollercoaster?

08:42.773 --> 08:45.174
Quick announcement: we're out of food.

08:45.175 --> 08:46.909
Have fun.

08:48.178 --> 08:50.113
Rel, I know you ain't want
your kids to learn,

08:50.114 --> 08:52.849
but today, they definitely gonna
learn about disappointment.

08:58.041 --> 08:59.503
All right, kids why don't you

08:59.504 --> 09:01.125
go get some tokens, okay? Here you go.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.741
Oh, man, this place
is gonna damage the kids

09:04.742 --> 09:07.544
more than the divorce.

09:07.545 --> 09:09.513
But Rel, they got on the plane
early in the morning.

09:09.514 --> 09:12.416
If you plan to make this
the best weekend of their lives,

09:12.417 --> 09:14.117
you gonna have to work
with what you got here.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.686
Yeah, I mean, you encourage your kids

09:15.687 --> 09:17.254
to use their imagination, right?

09:17.255 --> 09:21.291
Just tell them to imagine
this place don't suck.

09:21.292 --> 09:23.360
Come on, Rel.
Don't be acting all bougie.

09:23.361 --> 09:27.597
Look, I used to buy your
tennis shoes at gas stations.

09:27.598 --> 09:29.766
Don't be trying to act
all brand-new now.

09:29.767 --> 09:32.769
This place has, uh,
all the essentials you need

09:32.770 --> 09:34.071
to have a fun time.

09:34.072 --> 09:36.274
Listen up.

09:36.275 --> 09:39.576
I'm only gonna say this one more time.

09:39.577 --> 09:40.877
We out of toilet paper.

09:40.878 --> 09:42.546
Now, the roads are messed up.

09:42.547 --> 09:44.948
If you want to go out there
and go get some, go get some.

09:44.949 --> 09:47.884
But I'm not going out
that weather and kill myself

09:47.885 --> 09:50.220
just so you can wipe <i>your</i> ass.

09:51.556 --> 09:53.557
Thank you.

09:55.226 --> 09:57.928
Look, what other options you got, man?

09:57.929 --> 09:59.730
Good luck, y'all have fun.

09:59.731 --> 10:01.665
Hey, where you going?

10:01.666 --> 10:03.900
Look, I'm the grandfather. My
job is to take pictures of kids,

10:03.901 --> 10:07.471
so when I'm dead, they know
what I look like, all right?

10:07.472 --> 10:11.575
I'm-a sit on this grandpa bench
and watch the game.

10:11.576 --> 10:13.243
Well, guess it's strip club rules.

10:13.244 --> 10:14.778
Have as much as fun
as you can while touching

H-Hey, hey. Y'all three, knock it off.

Y'all need to learn
how to play nice together.

This type of behavior is not

Y'all need to learn how to get along,

Man, shut your ugly ass up.

11:50.174 --> 11:51.575
They didn't have places like this

11:51.576 --> 11:53.243
when we were growing up, huh?

11:53.244 --> 11:56.413
I don't know, man. My dad would
just give me a cardboard box,

11:56.414 --> 11:58.949
tell me to go outside and play
and use my imagination.

12:00.451 --> 12:02.118
Well, my folks would
tell us all the time

12:02.119 --> 12:03.787
to go get some fresh air.

12:03.788 --> 12:06.089
Like the west side of Chicago
was known for fresh air.

12:07.792 --> 12:10.260
Yeah, I think, uh, you know,
a parent's job back in the day

12:10.261 --> 12:12.596
was just get their damn kids
out the house, you know?

12:12.597 --> 12:14.965
Mm, mm, mm. That's what it was.

12:14.966 --> 12:17.601
I mean, we used to go outside
and play in the rain.

12:17.602 --> 12:20.770
Thunderstorms, they...
they were never even worried.

12:22.273 --> 12:25.475
Those were more innocent
and, and simpler times.

12:25.476 --> 12:28.078
Yeah, that it was, that it was.

12:28.079 --> 12:29.246
That it was.

12:30.815 --> 12:35.085
So, uh... wondering if, uh, you know,

12:35.086 --> 12:37.087
if you're not too busy
with the game and all,

12:37.088 --> 12:42.359
if you would like to come back
my car for a bit of a tug?

12:44.896 --> 12:46.329
What'd you say?

12:46.330 --> 12:48.131
I was saying if you're available,

12:48.132 --> 12:49.966
and you're not occupied

12:49.967 --> 12:51.801
with whatever you're
watching on your phone,

12:51.802 --> 12:56.806
if you would like to come to car
and, you know, tug it up a bit.

12:56.807 --> 12:58.775
No, I don't know
what you talking about,

12:58.776 --> 13:01.177
and I don't need to know,
so I'm-a go ahead and go inside

13:01.178 --> 13:02.812
and play with my grandkids

13:02.813 --> 13:05.982
and I hope you find
what you looking for.

13:05.983 --> 13:11.921
I always do. I always do.

13:13.190 --> 13:14.858
Hey. How you doing?
This little girl yours?

13:14.859 --> 13:17.127
- And who's asking?
- Well, earlier, she was trying

13:17.128 --> 13:19.529
to fight two other kids,
and when I told her to stop,

13:19.530 --> 13:21.498
she basically cursed me out.

13:21.499 --> 13:22.766
What'd you mean, "basically"? I mean,

13:22.767 --> 13:24.467
did she curse your ass out or not?

13:27.271 --> 13:29.939
Well, she told me
to shut my ugly ass up.

13:31.609 --> 13:34.844
Well, maybe you needed to.

13:34.845 --> 13:36.446
What the hell kind of parent are you?

13:36.447 --> 13:38.014
Oh, my God. You know what?
I am sick and tired

13:38.015 --> 13:40.517
of random-ass people trying
to tell me how to parent my kid.

13:40.518 --> 13:43.186
Okay? Me and my baby,
we like sisters, all right?

13:43.187 --> 13:45.355
We get our nails done together,
we get our hair done together

13:45.356 --> 13:49.192
and I can't wait until we have
a baby at the same time, okay?

13:49.193 --> 13:51.194
So you out here trying
to be her sister

13:51.195 --> 13:52.862
when what she needs is a mother.

13:52.863 --> 13:56.032
'Cause when I look at her, I see me.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.534
A young girl with potential

13:57.535 --> 13:59.869
with a mother
who don't even recognize it.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.871
So whose mom are you?

14:01.872 --> 14:04.074
I'm nobody's mom.

14:04.075 --> 14:05.809
I'm a vigilante parent.

14:08.646 --> 14:11.481
Okay. 52 tickets.
Let's see what we can get, uh,

14:11.482 --> 14:14.517
an eraser, gumball...

14:14.518 --> 14:16.386
some corn bread mix?

14:16.387 --> 14:18.021
Come on, Rel, man.

14:18.022 --> 14:19.889
Shouldn't the kids be picking
out their own prizes?

14:19.890 --> 14:22.559
No, Dad, it's way more
important than that, right?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.094
Whatever they pick,
they're gonna take back

14:24.095 --> 14:25.562
to Cleveland with them,
and it's gonna remind them

14:25.563 --> 14:27.030
of how much they father loves them.

14:27.031 --> 14:28.231
It's got to be perfect.

14:28.232 --> 14:29.866
Rel, can I give some advice?

14:29.867 --> 14:32.569
Look at this place.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.405
Look at your life. Ain't nothing
about this perfect.

14:35.406 --> 14:37.741
But you here, man.
That's the main thing.

14:37.742 --> 14:39.075
They're gonna remember
you're here with them.

14:39.076 --> 14:41.378
Half the part of being
a dad is showing up.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.747
You did fine, son.

14:43.748 --> 14:46.249
Everyone talks about great dads,
but nobody gives respect

14:46.250 --> 14:48.418
to the fine dads. All right?

14:48.419 --> 14:50.053
Let's go home and make some corn bread

14:50.054 --> 14:53.056
and get them out of here.

14:53.057 --> 14:56.259
Look, Dad, I don't want
to just be a fine dad.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.762
Terry told me yesterday that he's...

14:58.763 --> 15:01.431
he's used to not seeing me anymore.

15:01.432 --> 15:04.868
Oh, damn, that was quick.

15:04.869 --> 15:06.636
Look, you know,
you're one stepfather away

15:06.637 --> 15:08.071
from losing your kids completely.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.374
I tell you what, I'm in.
Whatever it takes,

15:11.375 --> 15:12.742
let's do it.

15:12.743 --> 15:14.444
Honestly, I think I gotta win, like,

15:14.445 --> 15:15.812
the biggest prize in this dump.

15:15.813 --> 15:17.714
Matter of fact,
gotta win that right there.

15:18.783 --> 15:20.717
- Okay. Okay.
- How about this?

15:20.718 --> 15:22.786
Oh, no, not-not this, Rel.
Come on, Rel.

15:22.787 --> 15:25.455
This takes, like, reflexes,
coordination, eyesight.

15:25.456 --> 15:26.990
You don't have none of that stuff.

15:30.828 --> 15:32.762
Too fast.

15:32.763 --> 15:35.231
Too slow

15:35.232 --> 15:36.433
Damn, Rel.

15:36.434 --> 15:37.901
- You even looking at the light?
- Dad, come...

15:37.902 --> 15:39.903
Would you leave me alone?
Okay, get off my back, Dad.

15:39.904 --> 15:40.837
All right? Geez.

15:40.838 --> 15:43.006
Stupid game.

15:44.475 --> 15:45.642
I did it, Dad.

15:45.643 --> 15:46.743
- You the man.
- Yes! Told you

15:46.744 --> 15:48.511
I had reflexes.
Hey, kids, come over here.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.146
Your daddy's a winner, huh?

15:50.147 --> 15:51.514
Who's the best dad of all time?

15:51.515 --> 15:53.149
Look at this. Hit the jackpot.

15:53.150 --> 15:56.753
That's right,
give me my 5,000 tickets.

15:56.754 --> 15:59.022
Okay.

16:03.027 --> 16:05.094
Aw, hell no.

16:09.042 --> 16:12.467
One ticket? Man, it's
supposed to be 5000.

16:12.782 --> 16:15.150
No, forget that.
Somebody got to be working here.

16:15.151 --> 16:17.118
Hey, hey, anybody work here? Hey!

16:17.119 --> 16:18.787
Hey, brother, what's wrong?

16:18.788 --> 16:20.789
You get bit by one of them rats, too?

16:20.790 --> 16:22.190
- What?
- What?

16:22.191 --> 16:24.125
Whatever, man.

16:24.126 --> 16:25.961
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to talk to the owner.

16:25.962 --> 16:28.330
I am the owner. I'm Victor.

16:28.331 --> 16:29.965
Wait a minute, Moophy is Victor?

16:29.966 --> 16:32.000
I didn't see that coming.

16:32.001 --> 16:33.501
Okay, look,

16:33.502 --> 16:35.370
Moophy, your-your machine
ripped me off.

16:35.371 --> 16:38.306
Victor. When the head is off,
I'm Victor.

16:38.307 --> 16:39.841
Moophy. Victor.

16:39.842 --> 16:44.012
Brother, look, I don't care
what your name is, okay?

16:44.013 --> 16:45.280
I pressed that button.

16:45.281 --> 16:47.515
It lit up, said I won 5,000 tickets.

16:47.516 --> 16:49.451
It only printed out one ticket.

16:49.452 --> 16:51.353
I just want to get my kids
the grand prize.

16:51.354 --> 16:52.487
Oh, that prize right there?

16:52.488 --> 16:54.522
Oh, we don't give that away.

16:54.523 --> 16:55.857
That's for brothers like you

16:55.858 --> 16:58.193
who feel very guilty about their kids

16:58.194 --> 17:00.028
so you can spend more money

17:00.029 --> 17:02.163
trying to buy their love.

17:02.164 --> 17:03.384
And I can look at your kids.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.034
They been disappointed before.

17:06.035 --> 17:08.703
Look here, man.

17:08.704 --> 17:11.041
You're gonna give me
that damn scooter.

17:11.042 --> 17:12.609
Rel, don't even worry about it.

17:12.611 --> 17:14.145
- It's not that serious.
- No, no, no, no, no.

17:14.146 --> 17:16.079
It <i>is</i> that serious, okay?

17:16.080 --> 17:18.616
Okay, fair is fair. This ain't right.

17:18.617 --> 17:20.156
Whatever you trying to
do, I got your back.

17:20.156 --> 17:21.664
Me, too.

17:29.595 --> 17:31.996
You know something, Victor?

17:31.997 --> 17:33.798
I was wrong. I mean, even though
I pressed the button,

17:33.799 --> 17:35.233
it said "5,000 tickets,"

17:35.234 --> 17:38.135
but, I mean, maybe it meant
one ticket. I don't know.

17:38.136 --> 17:39.904
That's what it gave me.

17:39.905 --> 17:41.772
You know, so, hey, it is what it is.

17:41.773 --> 17:44.408
So me and my family, we're just
gonna get up out of here...

17:44.409 --> 17:46.444
- Oh, my God, that machine is on fire.
- Where?

17:46.445 --> 17:47.411
Block him.

17:47.412 --> 17:49.480
- Block him. Oh! Oh!
- Come on. Yeah.

17:51.149 --> 17:52.850
- Oh, we got to go.
- I'm being robbed!

17:52.851 --> 17:55.553
Police! I'm being robbed!

17:58.323 --> 18:00.358
Uh-oh.

18:01.627 --> 18:03.627
Hey.

18:05.163 --> 18:08.065
Terry, I see you doing
a great job packing.

18:09.935 --> 18:12.670
Um, look, I just wanted
to talk to you two.

18:12.671 --> 18:14.672
Um...

18:14.673 --> 18:16.440
Look, I'm really sorry

18:16.441 --> 18:19.644
for taking you
to such a terrible place.

18:19.645 --> 18:21.747
Yeah. You know, just a bit of advice:

18:21.748 --> 18:25.148
uh, never trust a
business by its website.

18:26.018 --> 18:28.352
- It's okay.
- No. No, it's not, okay?

18:28.353 --> 18:30.554
So what I want to do is I
want to make it up to you.

18:30.555 --> 18:32.290
You know, I know your flight
leaves really early

18:32.291 --> 18:34.191
in the morning,
so I think we got a couple hours

18:34.192 --> 18:36.494
we can maybe squeeze in,
go to, like, I don't know...

18:36.495 --> 18:37.862
Six Flags!

18:37.863 --> 18:40.665
Nah.

18:40.666 --> 18:42.800
Nah, son, they don't open that early.

18:42.801 --> 18:44.702
No, I was thinking
that we go somewhere,

18:44.703 --> 18:46.470
have a big breakfast.
You know, get whatever you want.

18:46.471 --> 18:49.507
- All your favorites, you know.
- Oh. Okay.

18:49.508 --> 18:51.542
Terry, chill.

18:51.543 --> 18:53.577
No, no, guys, it's-it's cool.

18:53.578 --> 18:55.046
Look, I've already
started planning what we do

18:55.047 --> 18:56.514
when I come to Cleveland, you know?

18:56.515 --> 18:58.716
We-we can do a bunch of stuff.
I think we can go

18:58.717 --> 19:01.252
to the Metroparks Zoo.
Uh, we can do some water parks.

19:01.253 --> 19:03.721
- Maybe some go-kart riding, you know?
- Dad.

19:03.722 --> 19:06.057
- Stop.
- What?

19:06.058 --> 19:09.560
You don't have to try so hard.
We love you.

19:09.561 --> 19:11.028
Yeah, Dad.

19:11.029 --> 19:12.563
You got to chill.

19:12.564 --> 19:16.500
We love you, even at terrible places.

19:20.505 --> 19:23.240
You two are my best friends,
you know that?

19:23.241 --> 19:25.676
That's sweet, but actually,

19:25.677 --> 19:27.244
Kelly's my best friend.

19:27.245 --> 19:29.580
But you can be my best dad friend.

19:29.581 --> 19:31.949
I'll only ever have one of those.

19:31.950 --> 19:33.784
And my best friend is Bobby.

19:33.785 --> 19:36.020
But I want a best dad friend, too.

19:37.589 --> 19:39.924
Y'all keep saying stuff...

19:39.925 --> 19:42.593
okay, that make me want to cry.

19:42.594 --> 19:43.928
Let's face it, Dad.

19:43.929 --> 19:46.297
You cry pretty easy.

19:47.065 --> 19:49.433
I mean, that is true.

19:49.434 --> 19:51.569
Well, well, look,
can you two do me a favor,

19:51.570 --> 19:54.572
and can you not mention
to your mom about...

19:54.573 --> 19:56.374
you know, everything that happened

19:56.375 --> 19:58.042
at Victor's Family Fun Center?

19:58.043 --> 20:01.145
What Family Fun Center?

20:01.146 --> 20:03.614
I never even heard of that place.

20:03.615 --> 20:07.118
Man, Kelly and Bobby
are so lucky to have you two.

20:07.119 --> 20:09.153
Come here

20:09.154 --> 20:11.822
Now, really, put y'all to bed.
Come on.

20:17.796 --> 20:19.663
- I'm fine, Dad.
- Ready? Dy

20:19.664 --> 20:21.132
Okay, brother.

20:21.133 --> 20:23.067
Good night.

20:23.068 --> 20:24.402
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:24.403 --> 20:26.904
- I love you.
- Love you, too. Good night.

20:26.905 --> 20:28.305
Good night.

20:28.306 --> 20:30.341
Okay.

20:44.823 --> 20:48.559
Dad, stop watching us sleep.

20:49.594 --> 20:51.595
