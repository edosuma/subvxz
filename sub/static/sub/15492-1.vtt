08:03.700 --> 08:09.700
Melancholy of Lars Von Trier

08:13.900 --> 08:20.200
Part 1 JUSTINE

09:00.700 --> 09:01.700
Sir...

09:07.410 --> 09:11.850
You can back up a little more if you want...
I think you need that extra...

09:11.900 --> 09:14.100
I don't think he can hear you.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.700
Sir, can you hear me up there?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.300
Can you copy, sailor?

09:20.700 --> 09:22.700
I think he's in a different county...

09:24.100 --> 09:25.700
It's like five feet.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.700
And now he stops. He's got five feet here.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.500
That's good. Stop, stop, stop, stop!

10:05.000 --> 10:07.500
Wait, wait, wait!

10:07.700 --> 10:10.700
You're a little close.
I think he can keep going a little bit, maybe.

10:11.288 --> 10:14.390
Oh, no, no, no.
He can't. I don't...

10:19.500 --> 10:21.900
Be careful, please. It is not my car.
I will.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.100
I promise.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.200
Turn around to the left, please.
Stop there, sir.

10:29.950 --> 10:31.050
Straighten up, sir.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.500
Yeah, I think I'm good there, right?

10:34.700 --> 10:36.000
You're not even looking.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
I can see it's not looking good.

10:39.582 --> 10:40.582
I'm a very experienced driver...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.700
It's like really close on that side.
Really?

10:46.900 --> 10:49.700
Yeah, don't go any further forward. Just straight...

10:50.200 --> 10:52.000
How do I put it in...?

10:52.700 --> 10:53.900
What?

10:59.713 --> 11:00.713
This way?

11:01.700 --> 11:03.000
Get out of the way.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.700
Come on.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.450
Sorry.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.600
Yes, I know.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.200
We're sorry.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.200
I won't even bother saying how late you are.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.500
Sorry. We're really sorry.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.000
Hi.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.500
Hi, Claire. So sorry.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Hi.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.900
We probably should have taken something smaller.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.700
This brilliant idea was yours of renting a stretch.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.700
This is very much not my project, okay?

11:48.300 --> 11:51.600
I spent the whole week with the dullest man on earth.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.600
Not to mention the most expensive wedding planner
on the planet.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.500
Okay, so you want this?

11:58.100 --> 11:59.500
Yeah, of course.

11:59.700 --> 12:04.200
So, when you're there... and that was two hours ago.

12:04.372 --> 12:05.372
Okay.

12:05.881 --> 12:07.381
All right, let's go.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.700
What star is that?

12:13.100 --> 12:13.740
I don't know.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.900
John, you're a bit of an expert on stars,
aren't you?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.500
I wouldn't say that.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.400
Oh, yes you would.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.700
Which one are you looking at exactly?

12:23.700 --> 12:24.800
The red one.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.565
I'm amazed you can see that.

12:28.600 --> 12:33.200
That's Antares. It's the main star in the
Scorpio constellation.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.700
Justine...

12:39.500 --> 12:41.700
We just have to go to the stables to say hello
to Abraham.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.200
No, you're not.
Oh, yes.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.700
Who's Abraham?

12:52.854 --> 12:53.854
Abraham.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.600
Look, I'm married.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.700
Michael's my husband now.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.600
I'm sure you two will like each other.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.500
Nice to meet you.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.700
I'm his mistress. I'm the only one who can ride him.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.000
That's not exactly true.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.700
What? Occasionally I take her for a ride.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.200
See you later.

13:23.800 --> 13:27.700
I can no longer be silent.
All the guests are waiting for more than two hours.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.550
I know.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.300
I'm at the end of my rope.

13:30.700 --> 13:33.600
Welcome to the reception of Mr. Steinam, Mr. Marko.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.100
Thank you.
Thank you, Little Father.

13:36.700 --> 13:40.100
Would you be so good as to to participate
in the wedding bean lottery?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.000
Of course.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
Please submit your bid as to the total number
of beans in the bottle.

13:50.100 --> 13:54.900
Yes, er... two million and six beans.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.500
Two million and six beans.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.600
Would you care to make a bid on behalf of your wife?

14:00.800 --> 14:03.700
Oh, I don't dare to do that.
I really don't.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.600
Very well, we'll let madam's bid remain open.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.000
We made it.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.200
Hi, Mom.

14:28.470 --> 14:29.470
Love that dress.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.800
Congratulations Aunt Steelbreaker.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.200
Thanks, Leo.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.600
What's this?
A dagger.

14:37.734 --> 14:38.734
Wow!

14:43.377 --> 14:44.377
Sweetheart.

14:48.100 --> 14:52.500
Let me introduce you.
This is Betty... and Betty.

14:52.700 --> 14:56.200
Betty and Betty, this is my daughter, Justine.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.500
Hi, nice to meet you.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.500
I'm gonna say hi to everybody.
Of course, of course.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.700
Ladies and gentlemen...

15:06.700 --> 15:11.100
We waited a while for this.
A toast to the bride and the groom.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.200
Justine and Michael.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.100
The tray must go left to right...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.700
From left to right.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.900
Justine, I don't want to make a speech.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.700
Why? Please.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.700
What are you doing?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.600
You'll see.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.200
Excuse me.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.700
Neither of the ladies sitting next to me
has been given a spoon.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.500
I'd like very much to have one.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.600
Excuse me.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.300
You're terrible.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.700
Waiter.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Justine, would you mind slapping your father
for me hard, please.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.500
Tim.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.200
Justine, listen up, goddammit.

16:43.700 --> 16:49.200
As most of you know,
I'm here tonight playing sort of a double role.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.700
On Michael's side, I'm best man.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.200
And, coincidentally, I'm also the employer
of the bride.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.200
I've got nothing bad to say about the groom, but...

16:59.700 --> 17:01.400
The bride...

17:03.500 --> 17:05.099
Justine...

17:05.500 --> 17:07.200
Gorgeous woman...

17:07.700 --> 17:09.700
Where's my tagline?

17:09.800 --> 17:12.500
You were always great in coming up
with a tagline in a hurry.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.099
What happened?

17:14.599 --> 17:17.400
Did your emotional life suddenly take over?

17:17.450 --> 17:21.200
Did finding the man of your life render you
unable to work?

17:21.700 --> 17:25.700
I'm just asking because if I were to choose between

17:25.701 --> 17:29.700
a woman for my dear friend Michael and an employee...

17:30.500 --> 17:32.700
I would always choose the employee.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.100
Advertising, Justine, advertising.

17:41.700 --> 17:46.200
Justine, you were way, way, way too good for advertising.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.800
You know it, I know it, we all know it.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.100
So thank you for staying with it.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.450
I'm gonna let you and the rest of you
think about this tagline now

17:56.451 --> 17:59.200
while I leak a bit of news.

18:00.100 --> 18:04.200
Today the company hasn't lost a copywriter...

18:04.500 --> 18:07.600
The company has gained a new art director.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.700
And that's you, Justine.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.700
Congratulations.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.300
Goddammit, you earned it.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.200
The father of the bride wants a word.

18:39.700 --> 18:45.600
My dear girl, you look...

18:46.700 --> 18:48.600
glowing today.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.600
And me, I'm just a little confused
what with all the Bettys at my table.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.200
Never seen you look so happy.

19:02.700 --> 19:07.100
So, what can say without talking about your mother?

19:08.300 --> 19:10.700
My wife of yesteryear.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.700
Which is exactly what I don't wish to do.

19:15.700 --> 19:20.200
I don't think that I would be revealing any secret
if I were to say

19:20.201 --> 19:24.700
that she can be very domineering at times.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.700
Domineering?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.900
What a load of crap!

19:29.600 --> 19:33.600
For those who don't know who I am,
I'm Claire and Justine's mother.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.800
Justine, if you have any ambition at all,

19:36.979 --> 19:40.149
it certainly doesn't come from your father's
side of the family.

19:42.700 --> 19:43.700
Yes.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.200
I wasn't at the church. I don't believe in marriage.

19:50.700 --> 19:54.450
Claire, whom I have always taken for a sensible girl,

19:54.451 --> 19:58.200
you've arranged a spectacular party.

19:58.700 --> 20:04.100
Till death do us part and forever and ever...
Justine and Michael.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.300
I just have one thing to say...

20:08.100 --> 20:09.600
Enjoy it while it lasts.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.600
I myself hate marriages.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.900
Gaby, please.

20:14.500 --> 20:18.700
Especially when they involve my closest family members.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.200
Why did you even bother coming?

20:44.700 --> 20:46.700
Justine, come with me.

21:03.700 --> 21:09.200
Listen to me. We agreed that you weren't going
to make any scenes tonight.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.000
The don't want any scenes.

21:11.050 --> 21:13.100
No, we don't!

21:13.764 --> 21:14.764
No.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.300
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.600
But I didn't do anything.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.700
You know what I mean.

21:32.942 --> 21:33.942
Okay.

21:36.915 --> 21:38.115
Okay.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.900
Katherine has demanded the floor.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.000
Where is the bride?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.900
I've looked everywhere, no bride.

24:31.700 --> 24:35.200
Now the groom is going to give a speech for the bride.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.200
Dear Justine...

24:50.900 --> 24:53.700
What are you doing to me?
I've never given a speech before.

24:56.700 --> 25:01.200
I'm serious, I've never given a speech before.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.200
Justine is the speaker.
She can say the most wonderful things, but...

25:05.350 --> 25:07.600
Then let her make the speech, damn it.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.200
Justine...

25:15.700 --> 25:17.700
I love you so much...

25:22.700 --> 25:27.700
And never dreamed that I would have
such a gorgeous wife.

25:32.200 --> 25:36.500
I believe that I'm the luckiest man on Earth.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.500
I love you.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.200
That's kind of it. That's all I have.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.780
Hello, everyone, we're going to move to the living room

25:58.819 --> 26:00.489
so that we can clear some tables.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.500
Then the newlyweds will dance.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.700
And then, at eleven thirty,
the bride and groom will cut the cake in here.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.500
He wants to be put to bed.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.300
Sweety, you did so good.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.500
I wanna do it.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.400
No, tonight's your night.
No, please.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.700
Are you sure?
Yeah, come on.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.600
Good night, sweetheart.
Come on, come here.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.900
Are you comfortable?

27:20.700 --> 27:23.200
When are we gonna build caves together?

27:23.500 --> 27:27.700
We're gonna build lots of caves together.
Just not  tonight.

27:28.300 --> 27:31.100
You're still my aunt Steelbreaker, aren't you?

27:31.500 --> 27:34.000
Yes. It's exactly who I am.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.500
Justine...

27:56.500 --> 27:57.700
Hi, Claire.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.700
I'm just taking a little nap.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.700
Don't nap, it's your wedding.

28:07.700 --> 28:09.700
You're not even halfway through yet.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.200
No. you're right.

28:17.700 --> 28:20.200
I have to pull myself together.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.600
What's going on, Justine?

28:43.700 --> 28:47.600
I'm trudging in through this...

28:48.916 --> 28:53.476
Praying really hard.

28:56.700 --> 28:59.700
It's clinging to my legs.

29:03.200 --> 29:07.200
It's really heavy to drag along.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.700
No, you're not.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.700
I know you'll hate to hear it.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.700
Don't say a word to Michael.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.200
You think I'm stupid?

30:24.900 --> 30:26.400
I'll get her.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.200
And my mom, too.
Yeah.

30:43.700 --> 30:48.000
Justine, It's John.
We're ready to cut the cake, sweetheart.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.100
Please come downstairs as soon as you can, okay?

30:57.900 --> 30:58.700
Gaby...

31:05.100 --> 31:06.100
Gaby...

31:17.700 --> 31:21.100
Gaby, I'm sorry to disturb you,
but we're ready to cut the cake.

31:23.700 --> 31:26.900
When Justine took her first crap on her potty,
I wasn't there.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.900
When she had her first sexual intercourse,
I wasn't there.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.100
So give me a break, please,
with all your fucking rituals.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.100
Unbelievable, fucking unbelievable.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.450
Everyone, thank you for being so patient.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.200
We're just having a little issue with the wedding dress.
She'll be right down.

31:45.700 --> 31:49.800
Those bitches have locked themselves in their bedrooms
and now they're taking a bath.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.700
Is everybody in your family stark raving mad?

31:56.600 --> 31:59.500
This is embarrassing.
I know.

32:02.200 --> 32:06.100
We should have put showers in the guest wing.
I've said it a hundred times.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.800
For fuck's sakes, if people want to linger in a bath,
stay at home.

32:09.850 --> 32:13.725
Here we offer you an 18 hole golf course,
where else would they get that?

32:14.300 --> 32:15.700
Nowhere.

32:18.700 --> 32:19.700
Unbelievable!

32:23.400 --> 32:25.550
That's it, she's out.
What, Justine?

32:25.600 --> 32:26.700
Your mother.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.600
Unbelievable.

33:44.200 --> 33:47.200
She ruined my wedding. I will not look at her.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.200
Outstanding.

34:04.838 --> 34:06.138
My God, we cut it.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.699
I'm sorry.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.900
No, don't say that.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.500
You should never say you're sorry.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.699
I can see that you're not feeling well tonight.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.199
You should have seen you weren't ready yesterday.

34:40.500 --> 34:43.400
I haven't been taking care of you lately.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.600
It's my fault.

34:51.699 --> 34:54.699
Can we talk somewhere?
Of course.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.600
Sit down, please.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.700
I wasn't going to give you this until tomorrow.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
I found our plot of land.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.900
They call it Empire apples.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.700
They're bright red and very sweet.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.600
But with the perfect tartness.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.700
I had one as a kid.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.500
Beautiful, huh?

35:34.500 --> 35:39.665
In ten years' time, when the trees have grown
you can sit in the shade, in a chair.

35:39.700 --> 35:43.700
If you still have days when you're feeling a little sad...

35:45.500 --> 35:48.400
I think that will make you happy again.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.100
It's very sweet.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.700
Yeah?

36:00.700 --> 36:03.100
No wonder you've been so busy.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.300
I signed the deed for it yesterday,
I didn't want to tell you.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.700
Here.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.810
No, you should have it,

36:12.850 --> 36:16.110
I want you to have it with you all the time
and hold on to it.

36:16.900 --> 36:20.600
So you can look at it once in a while.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.100
I'll always keep with me.

36:28.800 --> 36:32.700
Maybe we can have a little swing
hanging from one of the trees.

36:35.700 --> 36:38.200
We'll talk about that when the time comes.

36:38.700 --> 36:41.700
Yeah, no... of course.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.400
When the time comes.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.200
Goodbye.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.700
You'd better be goddamn happy.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.200
Yes, I should be.

37:53.150 --> 37:54.550
I really should be.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.700
Do you have any idea how much this party cost me?
A ballpark figure?

37:58.817 --> 37:59.817
No.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.100
I don't.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.400
Should I?
Yes, I think you should.

38:08.900 --> 38:10.500
A great deal of money.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.500
A huge amount of money.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.600
In fact, for most people, an arm and a leg.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.100
I hope you feel it's well spent.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.700
Well, that depends on whether or not we have a deal.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.800
A deal?
Yes, a deal.

38:32.900 --> 38:35.100
That you'll be happy.

38:38.900 --> 38:42.100
Yes, of course. Of course we have a deal.

38:42.700 --> 38:43.600
Good.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.600
Congratulations.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.900
I tried to throw your mother out.

38:50.500 --> 38:53.100
Yes, you usually do.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.800
Yes, I do.

38:59.700 --> 39:00.900
Thank you.

39:02.700 --> 39:05.200
It's a wonderful party you've given me.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.150
How many holes are on our golf course?

39:08.500 --> 39:09.200
Eighteen.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.000
That's right.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.400
Happy? Yeah.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.400
This is the young man.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.000
Congratulations.
Thank you.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.100
I'm Tim.
Hi, Tim.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.100
Tim started working for us two days ago.

39:55.150 --> 39:57.000
He happens to be my nephew, but ignore that.

39:57.100 --> 40:00.500
Tim thought I wouldn't be able to squeeze that tagline
out of you tonight.

40:00.700 --> 40:03.300
I thought it might be difficult.

40:03.500 --> 40:07.700
You're colleagues. I hired him the moment I heard
about his education.

40:09.700 --> 40:13.250
What education is perfect if you want to make it
in Public Relations?

40:16.500 --> 40:17.300
Tim?

40:18.600 --> 40:20.650
None at all, of course.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.600
It was almost too perfect.

40:22.900 --> 40:25.700
He knows nothing. I hired him on the spot.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
And at a very good salary. What do you say, Tim?

40:29.200 --> 40:31.700
A very good salary.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.700
Welcome, then, Tim.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.450
There's just a slight catch
to a very good job with a very good salary.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
The salary is very good.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.850
Why, what are you pushing Tim into doing?

40:44.900 --> 40:47.500
To get that damn tagline out of you tonight.

40:47.700 --> 40:52.000
Otherwise he's out on his ear, which sucks,
considering the debts he's in.

40:52.100 --> 40:52.900
Goodbye.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.500
Once you give her a job, she won't let go.

40:56.550 --> 40:59.600
You gotta be there at the time of birth,
so you follow her now.

40:59.650 --> 41:02.100
I mean, get that tagline.

41:33.800 --> 41:37.000
Do let me know if the tagline's there
and I'll jot it down.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.500
Spare me.

41:50.700 --> 41:53.500
I'll go out for a minute.

41:58.500 --> 41:59.700
I'm really sorry.

41:59.800 --> 42:04.200
I'm thrilled about this wedding
and I know it's costing John a lot of money.

42:04.700 --> 42:08.700
John's filthy mouth...
He needs to shut up about it.

42:09.300 --> 42:11.200
It 's not about the cost.

42:11.500 --> 42:15.100
It's just that I thought you really wanted this.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.200
But I do.

42:20.600 --> 42:24.800
Michael has tried to get through to you all evening
to no avail.

42:24.900 --> 42:26.500
That's not true.

42:26.700 --> 42:28.700
I smile and smile and smile...

42:28.750 --> 42:31.200
You're lying to all of us.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.300
Don't you miss this?

43:52.700 --> 43:54.700
What do you want in this place?

43:55.100 --> 43:56.700
You've no business here.

43:56.900 --> 43:58.200
Nor have I.

43:59.700 --> 44:04.200
Your sister, it seems, is somewhat bewitched by you.

44:04.361 --> 44:05.361
Mom...

44:08.100 --> 44:10.200
I'm a bit scared.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.700
A bit?

44:15.700 --> 44:18.700
I'd be scared out of my wits if I were you.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.200
No, it's something else, I...

44:24.700 --> 44:26.900
I'm frightened, Mom.

44:28.200 --> 44:31.700
I have trouble walking properly.

44:35.700 --> 44:38.500
You can still wobble, I see.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.700
So just wobble the hell out of here.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.700
Stop dreaming, Justine.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.500
I'm scared.
We all are, sweetie.

44:55.300 --> 44:58.200
Just forget it. Get the hell out of here.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.700
No, thanks.

46:27.700 --> 46:30.200
Everybody, excuse me.

46:30.700 --> 46:33.700
Could you all follow us outside, please.

46:36.700 --> 46:38.000
Betty, Betty, Betty...

46:39.200 --> 46:40.500
Another glass, please.

46:40.600 --> 46:41.750
Are you really called Betty?

46:41.800 --> 46:44.400
No sir, sorry.
Don't worry about it.

46:46.100 --> 46:47.700
Dad, can we talk?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.100
Could you sit with me for a little while?

51:55.200 --> 51:56.900
Wait. What?

51:59.500 --> 52:00.600
Wait.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.200
Get out of me.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.500
Michael, can you give me a moment?
What's happened?

52:08.100 --> 52:10.200
Just give me a moment, please.
What's happened?

52:13.700 --> 52:15.600
Can I have a moment, please?

52:17.700 --> 52:20.900
Yeah... of course.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.600
Can you zip me?

52:41.300 --> 52:42.600
Are you okay?

52:43.951 --> 52:44.951
Okay.

53:36.200 --> 53:37.400
Hi.

54:43.700 --> 54:45.600
Good night. Have a good time.

54:46.100 --> 54:48.100
I'm on my way home, my darling.

54:49.300 --> 54:52.700
Please, Dad, I really need to talk to you.

54:56.100 --> 54:57.300
Little Father...

54:59.700 --> 55:03.500
My dad would like to spend the night.
Is there a room available?

55:03.900 --> 55:06.500
Room number eight is vacant.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.665
We could prepare that for your father.

55:09.700 --> 55:12.500
Well ..
Yes, my father likes that.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.700
Then we can have breakfast in the morning.

55:45.800 --> 55:48.700
Justine...

55:49.000 --> 55:51.700
Why don't you come and have onion soup with us?

55:57.300 --> 55:59.300
Tim. Get us some soup.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.200
How's your wonderful night going?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.700
It's too bad about Tim.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.200
What about Tim?

56:21.500 --> 56:23.200
He got fired.

56:24.700 --> 56:27.600
He didn't last many hours in the business, but...

56:27.650 --> 56:32.500
then again, it's a rather unpredictable one,
you're king one day and beggar the next.

56:33.700 --> 56:36.500
So you go back to wherever you came from,
right buddy?

56:39.300 --> 56:43.700
I'm glad we found each other, Jack.
I was looking for you.

56:45.700 --> 56:50.100
Didn't I tell you? She can't stop working,
not even on your wedding night.

56:50.700 --> 56:53.700
I had nothing at the dinner...

56:54.200 --> 56:59.200
But I've been playing with an idea for a small campaign.

56:59.500 --> 57:03.400
The problem is, how do we effectively hook
a group of minors

57:03.451 --> 57:05.700
on our substandard product,

57:06.200 --> 57:08.800
preferably in a habit-forming way?

57:09.500 --> 57:12.700
And I've reached a conclusion in regards to the tagline.

57:13.600 --> 57:16.220
I was just thinking, what if...

57:16.272 --> 57:18.102
instead...

57:17.300 --> 57:23.000
we try to sell you to the public, Jack?

57:25.700 --> 57:30.300
Then, surprisingly,
I arrived right back where I started from.

57:31.400 --> 57:32.700
At nothing.

57:33.900 --> 57:36.900
Nothing? It's not such a bad tagline, Jack.

57:40.700 --> 57:45.700
Would my newly fledged aide please
expand a little on the thoughts of the tagline?

57:49.000 --> 57:51.700
Nothing is too much for you, Jack.

57:53.700 --> 57:57.600
I hate you and your firm so deeply

57:57.601 --> 58:01.500
I couldn't find the words to describe it.

58:03.100 --> 58:09.200
You are a despicable, power-hungry little man, Jack.

58:13.400 --> 58:15.500
Is that a resignation?

58:15.550 --> 58:18.800
'Cause there aren't too many jobs out there,
I tell you.

58:31.500 --> 58:32.900
I broke my plate.

59:15.500 --> 59:16.900
So I...

59:17.700 --> 59:18.770
I guess we'll...

59:20.535 --> 59:21.735
take off now.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.500
Yes.

59:35.200 --> 59:37.700
This could have been a lot different.

59:43.500 --> 59:46.200
Yes, Michael, that have been.

59:56.500 --> 59:58.300
But, Michael...

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.700
what did you expect?

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.700
Yeah.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.200
You're right.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.900
Claire...

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.200
Sometimes, I hate you so much.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:00.600
The way I see it, you're now short of a boss
and a husband.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:07.600
Could I, in all my humility, offer my services?

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.200
You have the ideas, I have the head for business.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.500
We could be the perfect couple.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.500
We've had good sex.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.500
I don't think that's a very good idea.

01:01:26.491 --> 01:01:27.491
No.

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:30.565
No.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.600
Excuse me, the result is ready.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.800
What?

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.200
The number of beans in the bottle has been arrived at.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.200
And?

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.350
Six hundred and seventy-eight.
That's the final count.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.050
Six hundred and seventy-eight?

01:01:48.085 --> 01:01:50.700
And none of the guests got it right.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:51.600
Really?

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:55.500
Some were pretty close, but no one guessed right.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.400
Incredible.
You could say that.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.300
Incredibly trivial.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.600
But that's the result of the competition.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.650
And a lot of people would like to know the result.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.200
And then there is the prize.

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.700
Throw it away.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.500
Dad...

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.844
To my beloved daughter, Betty.

01:02:56.201 --> 01:02:59.200
I'm as proud of you as any father could be.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:03.600
But I couldn't find you and I was offered a ride home
I couldn't refuse.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.700
See you soon. Kisses from your stupid dad.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.600
Justine, wake up.

01:03:40.368 --> 01:03:41.368
Wake up.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.700
We're going for a ride.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.000
I tried, Claire.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.500
Yes, you did.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.500
You really did.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.200
Come on.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.700
Come on, Abraham, come.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.200
Come on, lets go. Come on!

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.300
The red star is missing from Scorpio.

01:05:45.155 --> 01:05:47.055
Antares is no longer there.

01:06:06.111 --> 01:06:12.310
Part 2 CLAIRE

01:07:01.794 --> 01:07:06.692
I swear to God, your sister can't do anything by herself.

01:07:08.793 --> 01:07:10.992
Hello, darling. How are you?

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:15.290
Just do as I've told you.

01:07:16.286 --> 01:07:21.330
There's a taxi down the street waiting for you.
I already told her that.

01:07:23.885 --> 01:07:27.284
Just open the door, and get in.

01:07:27.388 --> 01:07:28.489
Unbelievable.

01:07:29.683 --> 01:07:31.883
Just get in the cab, darling.

01:07:32.984 --> 01:07:36.284
Well, then call me back if you can't make it to the cab.

01:07:36.487 --> 01:07:39.288
We'll pay for it when you arrive.
Don't worry about it.

01:07:39.383 --> 01:07:40.682
We'll see about that.

01:07:41.686 --> 01:07:43.485
I love you, darling.

01:07:44.784 --> 01:07:47.881
Please, John, she's my sister.
Oh, please!

01:07:48.287 --> 01:07:50.688
She's a bad influence on you and Leo.

01:07:50.786 --> 01:07:51.986
She's ill.

01:07:52.031 --> 01:07:53.280
Right.

01:08:01.986 --> 01:08:04.086
Have you been going online again?

01:08:06.689 --> 01:08:08.287
Claire, you promised.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.980
I'm afraid of that stupid planet.
That stupid planet?

01:08:13.281 --> 01:08:15.482
That wonderful planet, you mean.

01:08:15.982 --> 01:08:19.281
First it was black, now it's blue.

01:08:19.384 --> 01:08:22.684
Blocking Antares, hiding behind the sun.

01:08:23.283 --> 01:08:27.483
Darling, this is going to be the most amazing experience
we will have in our lives.

01:08:27.518 --> 01:08:30.881
It won't be here in five days,
and it is not going to hit us.

01:08:31.082 --> 01:08:33.783
Just like it didn't hit Mercury, as we knew it wouldn't.

01:08:33.885 --> 01:08:36.134
And it didn't hit Venus, as we well knew it wouldn't.

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.879
And it won't hit Earth, as we know it won't.

01:08:38.983 --> 01:08:40.884
Claire, look at me.

01:08:41.482 --> 01:08:44.483
Sweetheart, you have to trust a scientist.

01:08:45.676 --> 01:08:47.827
They say that it will hit...

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.977
No they don't, that's not true.

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:51.633
Not the real scientists.

01:08:51.679 --> 01:08:54.381
Now, the prophets of doom they'll write whatever
they can to get attract attention.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.979
But the real scientists, all of them agree.

01:08:57.081 --> 01:09:00.080
Melancholy is just gonna pass right in front of us.

01:09:00.381 --> 01:09:02.682
And it's gonna be the most beautiful sight ever.

01:09:04.981 --> 01:09:07.982
Now, I wish you'd watch it through the telescope with me.

01:09:08.881 --> 01:09:11.479
Please.
No, I'd better not.

01:09:25.678 --> 01:09:27.078
Son of a bitch.

01:09:42.475 --> 01:09:46.377
When are we going to build those caves,
Aunt Steelbreaker?

01:09:46.477 --> 01:09:49.475
Sweetheart, not right now.
We're gonna do that in a little while.

01:09:49.658 --> 01:09:50.658
Okay?

01:10:37.273 --> 01:10:38.974
She's still sleeping.

01:10:40.675 --> 01:10:43.177
Yes, but she has to get up now.

01:10:45.073 --> 01:10:46.772
What are you making?

01:10:47.369 --> 01:10:48.470
Meatloaf.

01:10:49.674 --> 01:10:51.773
Meatloaf?
Yeah.

01:10:52.475 --> 01:10:55.275
If that's doesn't get her out of bed, nothing will.

01:10:56.772 --> 01:11:00.675
Time to wake up, Justine. No more sleeping.

01:11:01.972 --> 01:11:07.071
Going to take you to a nice bath.
How would you like that? Come on.

01:11:09.475 --> 01:11:14.375
You 'll see you'll like it.
I promise. Come on.

01:11:18.668 --> 01:11:20.968
I'll wash you, okay?

01:11:21.773 --> 01:11:24.072
Just lift your foot.

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.068
Go on.

01:11:32.072 --> 01:11:33.773
Lift your foot.

01:11:35.972 --> 01:11:37.871
You need a bath.

01:11:40.572 --> 01:11:44.971
You need to wash. Right?
I'm so tired...

01:11:45.366 --> 01:11:47.066
Come on, try.

01:11:48.768 --> 01:11:50.367
I can not.

01:11:50.464 --> 01:11:53.064
Justine, you'll like it.

01:12:07.971 --> 01:12:09.770
See?

01:12:12.867 --> 01:12:15.815
It's nice, it's a nice bath.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.267
Justine... Please.

01:12:26.465 --> 01:12:27.966
Okay, so...

01:12:28.069 --> 01:12:30.370
We've practiced for tomorrow.

01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:35.762
And I have a surprise for you for dinner.

01:12:37.464 --> 01:12:39.365
Can you smell it?

01:12:41.363 --> 01:12:42.862
Meatloaf?

01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:44.667
Surprise!

01:13:26.665 --> 01:13:29.265
It tastes like ashes.

01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:39.965
It's all right, sis.

01:13:46.561 --> 01:13:50.462
Auntie  Steelbreaker's crying.
Don't worry, son.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.460
Do you want to go back up?

01:14:11.663 --> 01:14:13.264
May I be excused?

01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:15.060
Take one more bite.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.462
Look.

01:14:44.954 --> 01:14:48.951
It's a planet that has been hiding behind the sun.

01:14:49.461 --> 01:14:52.459
And now it passes by us.

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.954
It's called a Fly by.

01:15:05.457 --> 01:15:09.356
It's not something you need to frighten
aunt Steelbreaker with now.

01:15:14.456 --> 01:15:18.354
If you think I'm afraid of a planet,
then you're too stupid.

01:17:28.445 --> 01:17:32.646
Just a few things we're gonna need
in case of Melancholy gets really close.

01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:41.544
Look, I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't mention this to Claire.

01:17:43.842 --> 01:17:45.941
She gets anxious so easily.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:02.842
Come on, Justine.

01:18:13.943 --> 01:18:15.444
Take it. That's it.

01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:28.440
Come on, Justine, take him out.

01:18:29.541 --> 01:18:31.641
Justine, take him out!

01:18:53.943 --> 01:18:55.043
Come on.

01:18:56.543 --> 01:18:57.843
Come on!

01:18:58.738 --> 01:19:00.136
Come on!

01:19:02.545 --> 01:19:04.044
Don't beat him!

01:19:04.093 --> 01:19:05.241
Come on!

01:19:10.242 --> 01:19:12.444
Justine, don't beat him!

01:19:26.238 --> 01:19:27.840
Stop.

01:19:52.937 --> 01:19:54.937
There it is.

01:19:55.436 --> 01:19:57.835
There's your Fly by.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.120
You don't touch the instrument.
Come on Leo.

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:34.819
Look.

01:24:37.319 --> 01:24:40.368
Our son has invented a very fine device.

01:24:40.517 --> 01:24:45.518
If you adjust the steel
and point it towards the planet from your chest

01:24:45.616 --> 01:24:50.616
it'll tell you how fast it's approaching
and ultimately how fast it will recede.

01:24:51.224 --> 01:24:52.224
Okay.

01:24:59.416 --> 01:25:00.917
Leo...

01:25:01.067 --> 01:25:03.216
What are we excited about?

01:25:03.316 --> 01:25:05.766
Tomorrow night.
That's right.

01:25:09.614 --> 01:25:11.414
Wow, that's amazing.

01:25:11.614 --> 01:25:14.614
Amazing isn't it?
Let me look.

01:26:51.309 --> 01:26:54.208
Earth & Melancholia
Dance of Death

01:27:23.908 --> 01:27:25.606
John!

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:28.210
John!

01:27:29.706 --> 01:27:31.407
Coming.

01:27:38.206 --> 01:27:42.806
We're prepared for this. The power will be back on
in a few days.

01:27:51.703 --> 01:27:53.003
Claire...

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:57.651
Tomorrow evening Melancholy will pass us by

01:27:57.658 --> 01:28:00.407
and you'll never have to see it again, okay?

01:28:00.437 --> 01:28:02.803
So it won't hit us?

01:28:02.904 --> 01:28:04.603
Not a chance.

01:28:05.606 --> 01:28:09.706
What if your scientists have miscalculated and...

01:28:12.104 --> 01:28:14.005
They haven't.

01:28:15.405 --> 01:28:17.303
You promise?

01:28:20.402 --> 01:28:22.301
Of course I do.

01:28:23.804 --> 01:28:25.803
I promise.

01:28:32.101 --> 01:28:34.402
It's rising again.

01:28:34.507 --> 01:28:36.407
Just like the moon.

01:28:36.452 --> 01:28:39.350
Because of the Earth's rotation.

01:28:39.403 --> 01:28:42.003
Exactly like they said it would.

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:05.904
Are you hungry?  No, thanks.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:09.299
Are you okay?
Yeah.

01:29:28.402 --> 01:29:30.402
Do you plan to kill us all?

01:29:32.403 --> 01:29:35.002
Maybe I should take those.
Don't touch them.

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.400
Don't you touch them.

01:29:58.697 --> 01:30:02.196
Justine, come and have a bath.
I've had a bath.

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:05.799
Really?
Yes, I'm very clean.

01:30:07.897 --> 01:30:10.396
Little Father didn't come to work.

01:30:10.995 --> 01:30:13.892
I checked the noteboard.
He didn't leave one.

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:18.299
I tried to call him, but maybe something's wrong
with the phone.

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:25.798
You see, it's never happened before
that he didn't come to work without giving us notice.

01:30:27.793 --> 01:30:29.392
Does he have a family?

01:30:29.497 --> 01:30:31.897
He lives in the village...

01:30:32.198 --> 01:30:34.398
I do not know if he has a family.

01:30:35.397 --> 01:30:39.397
Maybe this is a time when he needs to be with them.

01:30:50.093 --> 01:30:52.794
It'll pass us by tonight.

01:30:55.690 --> 01:30:58.490
John is quite calm about it.

01:30:59.395 --> 01:31:01.295
Does that calm you down?

01:31:01.792 --> 01:31:03.593
Yes, of course.

01:31:03.645 --> 01:31:07.195
Well, John studies things. He always has.

01:31:17.391 --> 01:31:19.590
The earth is evil.

01:31:21.789 --> 01:31:23.890
We don't need to grieve for it.

01:31:25.587 --> 01:31:26.888
What?

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:29.292
Nobody will miss it.

01:31:35.892 --> 01:31:38.692
But where would Leo grow up?

01:31:42.992 --> 01:31:45.293
All I know is...

01:31:46.689 --> 01:31:49.689
Life on earth is evil.

01:31:50.386 --> 01:31:52.786
There may be life somewhere else.

01:31:52.839 --> 01:31:54.590
No, there isn't.

01:31:54.691 --> 01:31:56.489
How do you know?

01:31:57.291 --> 01:31:59.540
Because I know things.

01:31:59.688 --> 01:32:02.388
Oh, yes, you always imagine, you did.

01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:04.491
I know we're alone.

01:32:04.592 --> 01:32:07.290
I don't think you know that at all.

01:32:15.388 --> 01:32:18.387
Six hundred and seventy-eight.

01:32:18.688 --> 01:32:20.989
The bean lottery.

01:32:21.888 --> 01:32:25.388
Nobody guessed the amount of beans in the bottle.

01:32:25.889 --> 01:32:27.890
No, that's right.

01:32:27.935 --> 01:32:30.383
But I know.

01:32:30.489 --> 01:32:33.389
Six hundred and seventy-eight.

01:32:35.688 --> 01:32:37.888
Well, perhaps...

01:32:38.389 --> 01:32:40.386
What does that prove?

01:32:40.685 --> 01:32:42.586
That I know things.

01:32:46.889 --> 01:32:50.288
And when I say we're alone...

01:32:52.182 --> 01:32:54.283
We're alone.

01:32:54.883 --> 01:32:58.284
Life exists only on Earth.

01:33:00.386 --> 01:33:03.087
And not for long.

01:33:08.886 --> 01:33:12.186
I can stay up all evening till the middle of the night...

01:33:12.233 --> 01:33:17.384
when we get to see the planet fly by,
and I get to look at the telescope.

01:33:18.889 --> 01:33:21.288
Yes, of course, darling.

01:33:21.783 --> 01:33:25.283
But are you sure you can stay up that late?

01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:27.179
You haven't slept much lately.

01:33:27.233 --> 01:33:28.533
Yes, I can.

01:33:28.587 --> 01:33:31.285
Can't I, Auntie Steelbreaker?

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.879
Can't I?
Yes, you can. Of course you can.

01:33:59.979 --> 01:34:02.381
It's eleven. It's almost here.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.380
Leo, sweetheart.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.880
It's time to wake up.

01:34:10.721 --> 01:34:11.721
Leo.

01:34:14.072 --> 01:34:15.072
Leo.

01:34:18.582 --> 01:34:19.582
There.

01:34:55.875 --> 01:34:57.875
Leo should be watching this.

01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:13.479
My God.

01:35:32.272 --> 01:35:33.373
There.

01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:37.278
Take a look.

01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:01.573
Are you afraid?

01:36:05.875 --> 01:36:07.976
No, it looks...

01:36:09.074 --> 01:36:10.575
It looks friendly.

01:36:10.623 --> 01:36:12.374
Yes.

01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:16.270
That's what I've been trying to explain to you.

01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:20.468
My God.

01:36:57.972 --> 01:36:59.973
I'd like to raise a toast.

01:37:06.067 --> 01:37:07.566
To life.

01:37:10.169 --> 01:37:13.068
To life? What do you mean, to life?

01:37:14.365 --> 01:37:16.965
You said it was going to be okay.

01:37:19.766 --> 01:37:22.266
There was no sense in alarming everybody.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.768
So, you're saying that our lives were in danger?

01:37:24.818 --> 01:37:26.369
No, I was saying...

01:37:26.622 --> 01:37:31.402
No, I'm saying that when dealing with science
and calculations of this magnitude...

01:37:31.566 --> 01:37:35.364
you have to account for a margin of error.
That's all I'm saying.

01:37:41.164 --> 01:37:42.663
I'm sorry.

01:37:49.866 --> 01:37:52.265
It's not fun any more.

01:37:52.365 --> 01:37:55.365
Actually it's moving away from us as we speak.

01:37:56.662 --> 01:37:59.313
You just can't see it through the naked eye.

01:38:02.967 --> 01:38:04.665
Come here.

01:38:09.365 --> 01:38:11.364
Put this to your chest.

01:38:14.369 --> 01:38:17.000
Aim it up at the planet.
Hold on.

01:38:19.663 --> 01:38:22.262
Is that right?
Yes.

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:26.362
In five minutes... it'll be smaller.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.960
I can't breathe.
Just relax, relax.

01:38:55.016 --> 01:38:57.664
This is normal. It's taking part of our atmosphere.

01:38:57.710 --> 01:39:00.261
For a little while, it's gonna make us winded.

01:39:00.365 --> 01:39:02.864
Just try and breathe calmly.

01:39:05.961 --> 01:39:07.658
Just breathe.

01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:10.160
Just breathe.

01:39:11.261 --> 01:39:12.661
There you go.

01:39:13.161 --> 01:39:15.260
Just try to breathe calmly.

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:25.960
There you go.

01:39:32.955 --> 01:39:35.305
Please, can I look now?

01:39:36.558 --> 01:39:38.357
Of course.

01:39:50.461 --> 01:39:52.262
It's smaller.

01:39:53.761 --> 01:39:55.060
Of course it is.

01:39:55.357 --> 01:39:58.357
It's smaller! It's smaller!

01:39:58.961 --> 01:40:00.659
Sure. Of course it is.

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:09.011
It's moving away from us at over
sixty thousand miles an hour.

01:40:12.154 --> 01:40:14.356
For heaven's sake...

01:40:15.353 --> 01:40:17.353
Come here.

01:40:26.555 --> 01:40:27.755
Mom...

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:31.356
We have to stay up...

01:40:34.253 --> 01:40:36.853
I wanna look through the telescope...

01:40:37.857 --> 01:40:39.957
Breathe calmly.

01:40:46.855 --> 01:40:49.054
Be happy, please.

01:40:49.851 --> 01:40:52.151
If I dare, you can do it.

01:40:53.649 --> 01:40:56.351
I'm happy you're happy.

01:40:58.655 --> 01:41:01.057
You have it easy, don't you?

01:41:04.353 --> 01:41:07.253
I imagined the worst thing possible.

01:41:08.353 --> 01:41:12.255
That's right, Claire.
Sometimes it's easy being me.

01:41:25.353 --> 01:41:27.252
Hi, darling.

01:41:30.148 --> 01:41:32.848
Do you want tea?
No, thank you.

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:34.952
Something to drink?

01:44:27.453 --> 01:44:28.453
John!

01:44:29.542 --> 01:44:30.542
John!

01:44:33.568 --> 01:44:34.568
John!

01:44:38.406 --> 01:44:39.406
John.

01:44:45.891 --> 01:44:46.891
John.

01:44:49.865 --> 01:44:50.865
John.

01:45:00.844 --> 01:45:01.844
John!

01:45:43.333 --> 01:45:47.733
I can't find John. Do you know where he is?

01:45:49.232 --> 01:45:50.133
No.

01:45:53.334 --> 01:45:55.334
I was just listening.

01:45:58.285 --> 01:46:00.336
There's something different.

01:46:04.333 --> 01:46:07.833
The horses... They've come down.

01:46:56.328 --> 01:46:57.328
John...

01:48:00.825 --> 01:48:02.926
Good morning, Mom.

01:48:05.223 --> 01:48:06.824
Get a blanket.

01:48:20.223 --> 01:48:22.223
Justine, breakfast.

01:48:33.922 --> 01:48:35.720
Where's John?

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:39.121
He rode to the village.

01:48:42.625 --> 01:48:44.825
Why didn't he just take the car?

01:48:45.925 --> 01:48:48.226
Abraham needed a ride.

01:48:49.326 --> 01:48:51.326
Since you never ride him.

01:49:56.221 --> 01:49:57.622
Come with me.

01:49:57.816 --> 01:49:59.314
Justine...

01:50:00.821 --> 01:50:02.321
Come!

01:50:36.619 --> 01:50:37.720
Claire...

01:50:58.716 --> 01:51:02.315
Claire. Dammit... what...?

01:51:02.464 --> 01:51:03.464
Claire.

01:51:18.317 --> 01:51:22.316
Where are you going?
To the village. Come.

01:51:22.512 --> 01:51:24.611
This has nothing to do with the village.

01:51:24.909 --> 01:51:26.310
Get in!

01:55:16.298 --> 01:55:19.799
I want us to be together when it happens.

01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:26.299
Outside on the terrace.

01:55:33.298 --> 01:55:35.995
Help me, Justine.

01:55:36.295 --> 01:55:39.197
I want to do this the right way.

01:55:40.296 --> 01:55:42.295
Better do it quickly.

01:55:44.095 --> 01:55:47.594
A glass of wine together, maybe?

01:55:49.099 --> 01:55:51.798
You want me to have a glass of wine on your terrace?

01:55:52.299 --> 01:55:54.300
Yes, would you do it, sis?

01:55:55.794 --> 01:55:57.992
How about a song?

01:56:01.795 --> 01:56:04.094
Beethoven's Ninth...

01:56:05.196 --> 01:56:07.096
Something like that?

01:56:09.291 --> 01:56:11.792
Perhaps we could light some candles.

01:56:14.295 --> 01:56:17.296
You just want us all to gather on your terrace

01:56:17.292 --> 01:56:20.291
sing a song and have a glass of wine...

01:56:20.896 --> 01:56:22.796
the three of us.

01:56:25.092 --> 01:56:27.792
Yes, that would make me happy.

01:56:34.292 --> 01:56:36.791
Do you know what I think of your plan?

01:56:39.627 --> 01:56:40.827
No.

01:56:41.290 --> 01:56:44.289
I only think that he might like it.

01:56:48.693 --> 01:56:50.792
I think it's a piece of shit.

01:56:54.795 --> 01:56:56.695
Justine, please...

01:56:59.691 --> 01:57:01.791
I just wanted to be nice.

01:57:01.839 --> 01:57:04.090
Nice?

01:57:05.288 --> 01:57:07.989
Why don't we meet in the fucking toilet?

01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:12.793
Then let's not.

01:57:13.289 --> 01:57:15.289
You're damn right, let's not.

01:57:21.291 --> 01:57:25.293
Sometimes I hate you so much, Justine.

01:58:17.288 --> 01:58:21.789
I'm afraid that the planet will hit us, anyway.

01:58:30.287 --> 01:58:34.785
Don't be... please.

01:58:35.782 --> 01:58:38.282
Dad said there is nothing to do, then...

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.285
Nowhere to hide.

01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:52.287
If your dad said that,
then he's forgotten about something.

01:58:57.086 --> 01:59:00.285
He's forgotten about the magic cave.

01:59:00.784 --> 01:59:04.186
The magic cave...
Yep.

01:59:09.782 --> 01:59:12.282
Is that something everybody can make?

01:59:14.281 --> 01:59:16.280
Aunt Steelbreaker can.

01:59:33.483 --> 01:59:36.284
All right, let's go find stick, all right?

02:01:35.969 --> 02:01:37.769
Hold my hand.

02:01:42.477 --> 02:01:43.975
Close your eyes.
