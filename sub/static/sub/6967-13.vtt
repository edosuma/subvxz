00:07.407 --> 00:09.568
Are you gonna leave this up all year?

00:10.610 --> 00:12.373
Yup. All year.

00:12.445 --> 00:16.074
Since you always made us take
the tree down the day after Christmas...

00:16.216 --> 00:18.207
...l'm making up for lost time.

00:18.284 --> 00:22.778
If your idea of a good time is to pick up
dried pine needles, treat yourself.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.826
As if he's an authority on having a good time!

00:27.794 --> 00:30.092
- That's OK, Mom, I got that.
- OK.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.460
OK, Maggie. Let's shove off.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.359
OK.

00:35.435 --> 00:38.962
Thank you for having us.
Dinner was delicious, as usual.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.098
Thanks, Mom.

00:42.909 --> 00:44.308
Good sailing, Ahab.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.776
Good night, Starbuck.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.878
How's work? Good?

00:54.988 --> 00:57.718
Yup. It's good.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.099 --> 01:08.397
Drive carefully.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.066
Good night, Daddy.

01:24.017 --> 01:29.011
Here on "Incredible Inventions", you're not
going to spend $110 for it. You all know that.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.250
You're not even going to spend $100.

01:31.324 --> 01:34.350
There's an approximate
one month supply here.

01:34.461 --> 01:38.488
And all you'll spend for this
entire package is just $39.92...

01:50.910 --> 01:52.969
Dad?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.041
I thought you guys left.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.315
Where's Mom?

02:19.506 --> 02:21.565
Hello?

02:23.109 --> 02:25.202
Hello?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.539
Dana?

02:29.616 --> 02:32.210
Mom? What's the matter?

02:33.586 --> 02:35.679
We...

02:37.357 --> 02:39.416
We lost your dad.

02:40.326 --> 02:45.491
He had...
a massive coronary about an hour ago.

02:48.801 --> 02:50.894
He's gone.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.767
I swear! Christmas Day!

04:05.178 --> 04:08.011
My whole family's opening presents an' all.

04:09.215 --> 04:14.847
And I'm just sitting there in my own little
world, thinking, "I just wish Jim were here."

04:14.921 --> 04:16.582
I know.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.791
Oh, man! Busted!

04:29.702 --> 04:32.068
- Yes, sir?
- Out of the vehicle, please.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.436
Sir, I'm sorry. We'll be on our way.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.238
I said, out of the vehicle.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.281
Keep your hands down.

04:54.527 --> 04:57.052
Let's see some ID.

04:57.163 --> 04:59.757
No, not till I see yours.

05:20.253 --> 05:24.314
Last time you were that engrossed,
you were reading Adult Video News!

05:25.692 --> 05:27.785
I didn't think you'd be in today.

05:28.394 --> 05:31.261
How are you, Dana?

05:31.331 --> 05:33.390
Dana...

05:33.499 --> 05:36.559
I'm fine, thank you.
What are you working on?

05:38.071 --> 05:41.802
Two days ago, a couple was kidnapped
at Jackson University.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.069
Elizabeth Hawley and James Summers.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.610
Both nineteen.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.272
Last year another couple was kidnapped
to the day.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.806
Except that abduction
occurred at Duke University.

05:51.918 --> 05:55.081
One week later,
they found both students' bodies - dead.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.419
They were kept alive,
tortured during that period.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.583
No arrests were ever made.

06:00.693 --> 06:05.392
Police believed it to be a one-time offender.
Now it appears to be a serial incident.

06:05.498 --> 06:09.195
If he holds true to form,
we have five days to find those kids.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.361
That's a grim deadline.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.530
Here's another grim deadline.

06:16.042 --> 06:20.911
In one week, Luther Lee Boggs will take
a seat in the North Carolina gas chamber.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.141
How is he related?

06:23.216 --> 06:26.913
He claims to have information
relating to the kidnapping.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.216
He described Hawley's bracelet exactly.

06:29.322 --> 06:33.224
This is information that only
family members could have known.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.021
Or the kidnapper.

06:36.162 --> 06:39.325
Boggs feels that if his talents
help save these kids,

06:39.399 --> 06:42.334
his sentence should be
reduced to life in prison.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.461
His "talents"?

06:44.570 --> 06:49.598
He claims to have obtained this information
through psychic transmissions.

06:50.943 --> 06:53.935
Mulder, do I detect a hint of skepticism?

06:54.013 --> 06:55.674
Perhaps.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.841
Boggs has been there before.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.815
In the chamber.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.047
My profile helped send him there.

07:02.188 --> 07:07.057
He was actually strapped to the chair
before receiving an executive stay.

07:07.193 --> 07:12.859
He claims that this experience activated in
him the ability to channel spirits and demons.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.490
I believe in psychic ability, without a doubt.

07:15.601 --> 07:19.002
But not in this case. Not Boggs.

07:19.872 --> 07:24.002
So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating
the kidnapping from the inside?

07:24.076 --> 07:26.203
A scam to save his life?

07:29.248 --> 07:31.307
At the age of six,

07:31.417 --> 07:35.376
Luther Boggs slaughtered
every pet animal on his housing project.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.118
When he was 30, he strangled five
family members over Thanksgiving dinner,

07:39.225 --> 07:41.989
and then watched
the Detroit-Green Bay game.

07:43.062 --> 07:46.031
Some killers are products of society.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.726
Some act out past abuses.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.029
Boggs kills because he likes it.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.207
And they've requested you speak with him?

07:57.276 --> 08:00.473
Actually, he's requested to speak to me.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.537
Why you?

08:02.648 --> 08:04.707
He read my profile on him

08:04.817 --> 08:08.810
and he feels like I'm the only one
who truly understands what he is.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.880
- I leave for Raleigh this afternoon.
- I'll go with you.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.324
The funeral's at noon.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.495
I think you should take some time.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.899
- I need to work.
- I'm sorry about your father.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.070
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

09:10.683 --> 09:15.620
As a captain, he was entitled to burial
in Arlington with full ceremony.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.614
This is exactly the way he wanted it.

09:21.694 --> 09:22.991
Just the family.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.738
This song was playing when his ship
returned from the Cuban blockade.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.950
He marched right off, up to me,

09:47.954 --> 09:50.013
and he proposed.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.120
I know that you and Dad were...

09:57.997 --> 10:01.660
disappointed that I chose
the path I'm on, instead of medicine.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.826
But I need to know...

10:06.939 --> 10:09.737
Was he at all proud of me?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.870
He was your father.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.987
The soul of Luther Boggs

10:31.964 --> 10:34.558
drowns in hell's sea of fire.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.266
We have him now.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.435
"We"?

10:46.512 --> 10:48.776
You mean the souls of your victims?

10:52.785 --> 10:55.185
The dead.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.313
The living.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.825
All souls are connected.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.421
And you're the conduit?

11:11.003 --> 11:13.096
Dana,

11:13.906 --> 11:15.999
Fox,

11:16.108 --> 11:20.738
please understand that from here
we can return to the past.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.409
We can see the present,

11:24.483 --> 11:26.508
we can know the future...

11:27.887 --> 11:31.323
"From here"? Where exactly are you?

11:42.535 --> 11:46.301
Mr Boggs must be made redemptive

11:46.372 --> 11:49.307
for his transgressions.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.971
That's exactly what the State of
North Carolina intends to do next week.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.080
Let's deal.

12:03.789 --> 12:07.452
Boggs' life for the kids.
You know what I'm saying?

12:07.526 --> 12:10.984
First you gotta prove you're telling the truth.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.395
Don't get me wrong, Luther.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.000
I wanna believe.

12:36.522 --> 12:40.083
God! No!

12:40.159 --> 12:44.118
Must stop! Stop!

12:44.196 --> 12:46.289
Pain!

12:46.365 --> 12:48.833
Pain... terrible pain.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.199
The boy...

12:54.440 --> 12:56.533
Jim...

12:56.609 --> 12:58.702
He's tied with... twine.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.336
Packing twine.

13:11.624 --> 13:16.391
He whups him with a coat hanger,
a wire coat hanger.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.171
Dark place.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.407
Cold.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.046
Cellar.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.283
Warehouse, condemned.

13:53.065 --> 13:55.158
An angel

13:55.901 --> 13:58.426
of stone.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.972
Waterfall.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.166
Water falling.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.603
It's not a waterfall. Not water.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.375
They're there.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.215
Oh, God... I gotta go.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.619
I gotta go.

14:23.062 --> 14:25.121
I gotta go.

14:38.344 --> 14:41.074
I tore this off my New York Knicks T-shirt.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.610
It has nothing to do with the crime.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.357
Somewhere...

15:03.168 --> 15:05.227
...beyond the sea

15:06.939 --> 15:09.464
Somewhere waiting for me

15:21.553 --> 15:24.181
Did you get my message, Starbuck?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.855
Thanks a lot.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.058
Scully? What's wrong?

15:36.168 --> 15:38.466
Did Boggs say something to you?

15:39.805 --> 15:41.898
No.

15:41.974 --> 15:46.468
- It's my father. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

15:46.545 --> 15:48.706
Why don't you go back to the motel?

15:50.482 --> 15:52.507
We've exposed Boggs as a fraud.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.677
Boggs is not what he claims to be.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.119
He may be orchestrating the kidnapping.

15:57.189 --> 16:01.592
Now he knows we're onto him, he doesn't
have a chance with this charade.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.094
I'm gonna wait around and interrogate him.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.223
Hopefully, he'll tell me where the kids are.

16:08.367 --> 16:12.030
Somewhere... beyond the shore

16:13.238 --> 16:15.638
We'll kiss just as before

16:16.642 --> 16:19.042
Happy we'll be

16:19.144 --> 16:21.203
Beyond the sea

16:33.459 --> 16:36.860
Water falling. Not a waterfall.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.196
An angel of stone.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.101
It's Mulder!

18:30.309 --> 18:34.871
Liz Hawley's family made a positive ID
on the charm you found at the warehouse.

18:34.947 --> 18:39.850
The police are searching the place inch
by inch, but haven't found anything yet.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.449
I expected to find you at the crime scene.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.383
Did Boggs confess?

18:47.493 --> 18:51.190
No. No, it was five hours
of Boggs's "channeling".

18:52.464 --> 18:56.400
After three hours, I asked him to
summon up the soul of Jimi Hendrix

18:56.502 --> 18:59.096
and requested All Along The Watchtower"!

18:59.171 --> 19:02.732
He's been dead 20 years,
but still hasn't lost his edge!

19:03.775 --> 19:07.142
I lied to the police about
how I found the warehouse.

19:07.613 --> 19:12.073
- I didn't notice any "suspicious activities".
- Then how did you find it?

19:12.918 --> 19:15.011
It was where Boggs said it would be.

19:16.021 --> 19:17.886
Scully, I told you about Boggs!

19:17.956 --> 19:22.552
I didn't go looking for it! I came across
an area that had landmarks he spoke of.

19:22.628 --> 19:27.691
That's exactly what Boggs wanted! He could
have been setting you up. You could be dead!

19:31.637 --> 19:35.004
Why did you feel
you had to lie on your police report?

19:36.041 --> 19:39.204
It was a better explanation
under the circumstances.

19:39.311 --> 19:43.509
You didn't want to go on record
admitting that you believed in Boggs.

19:43.582 --> 19:48.815
The Bureau would expect something like that
from spooky Mulder, but not Dana Scully.

19:52.057 --> 19:57.427
I thought that you'd be pleased that I'd
opened myself to extreme possibilities.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.430
Why now?!

19:59.531 --> 20:01.465
After all we've seen. Why Boggs?

20:07.773 --> 20:10.207
Does this have to do with your father?

20:11.777 --> 20:15.213
You said that he didn't approve
of you becoming an FBI agent.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.944
If being on the job now makes you feel
guilty or uncomfortable or uneasy,

20:20.052 --> 20:22.247
I think you should back away.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.380
Because if it's clouding yourjudgment,

20:25.457 --> 20:27.618
you're putting yourself in danger.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.220
- I love this job.
- You love your father.

20:37.603 --> 20:43.803
Dana... open yourself up to extreme
possibilities only when they're the truth.

20:43.875 --> 20:47.675
That goes for Luther Boggs... and your father.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.110
As for Luther Boggs...
he's the greatest of lies.

20:59.091 --> 21:03.858
I know he's working with someone on
the outside and they planted that evidence.

21:03.929 --> 21:09.390
We have to be very careful about plotting our
next move - he's planned five steps ahead.

21:09.468 --> 21:12.028
The only advantage we have is time.

21:19.678 --> 21:22.010
Scully, take a look at this.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.809
That's incredible!

21:23.882 --> 21:25.713
They found them?

21:25.817 --> 21:30.686
- That's exactly what I want Boggs to think.
- Why didn't the police notify us?

21:30.756 --> 21:36.319
The article is bogus. The Carolinian made it
up for us. Only six people know about it.

21:36.428 --> 21:40.091
Later on today,
Boggs gets his weekly phone privileges.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.759
Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice.

21:56.581 --> 21:58.674
Phone privileges in two hours.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.773
Go.

22:32.617 --> 22:34.812
Turn off that phone. Turn it off.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.114
Mulder, it's you.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.529
- Mulder.
- How come you don't believe me?

22:48.633 --> 22:50.828
Agent Scully does.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.597
She believes me.

22:54.906 --> 22:58.706
Agent Scully believes what we all
believe - that you have the kids.

22:58.777 --> 23:00.836
Now, where are they?

23:07.386 --> 23:12.517
Mulder... even if he is setting us up,
we have to follow, because in three days...

23:12.591 --> 23:15.151
Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead.

23:15.827 --> 23:21.322
A day later, our only connection to the case
will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.459
We have to deal.

23:28.673 --> 23:32.370
The kidnapper's aroused by
the prospect of becoming a killer.

23:32.444 --> 23:35.038
What's the name?

23:36.148 --> 23:38.582
Can't see. Male.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.380
Describe him.

23:41.853 --> 23:43.844
Small...

23:43.989 --> 23:46.048
Thin...

23:47.392 --> 23:49.451
Late twenties.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.262
Skull. Human skull.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.225
Silver gray.

23:56.301 --> 24:00.169
His eyes... cold, very cold,

24:00.238 --> 24:02.433
staring at Elizabeth.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.503
God! He's got the wire!

24:07.612 --> 24:11.810
Please! No!

24:17.989 --> 24:19.718
Where is he?

24:21.660 --> 24:23.719
He's

24:23.829 --> 24:26.730
over... by the window.

24:27.799 --> 24:31.735
Holding back... holding back
his thoughts of killing.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.867
Waiting.

24:38.009 --> 24:41.308
There's a small boathouse on Lake Jordan.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.472
You got that?

24:48.086 --> 24:49.644
Mulder.

24:51.256 --> 24:53.349
Don't go near the white cross.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.517
We see you down

24:56.862 --> 24:59.660
and your blood spills on the white cross.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.119
Anything?

25:32.497 --> 25:33.964
Sweep the docks!

25:56.021 --> 25:57.386
Federal agent!

25:58.790 --> 26:00.314
Mulder!

26:09.134 --> 26:12.160
We need an ambulance! Officer down!

26:38.630 --> 26:42.828
- What have we got?
- Through and through. Upper femur.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.963
Let's get him on the gurney.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.343
No.

27:03.655 --> 27:04.679
No.

27:07.993 --> 27:09.017
No.

27:19.037 --> 27:21.096
Lucas Jackson Henry, 28.

27:22.641 --> 27:27.408
Did some time at Angola in Louisiana
for sexual assault, narcotics. Nothing big.

27:27.479 --> 27:31.245
His personal history includes
being witness to an auto accident

27:31.316 --> 27:35.776
in which his high-school sweetheart
was killed and his mother decapitated.

27:35.854 --> 27:40.314
The seven-year anniversary
of that accident is in three days.

27:40.425 --> 27:42.484
He's reliving it.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.689
That would explain the deadline.

27:48.800 --> 27:53.237
The most important element we found
is there's substantial suspicion

27:53.304 --> 27:56.933
that Boggs' last five murders
were committed with a partner.

27:57.042 --> 28:00.637
The police in Durham say they
could never prove it in court,

28:00.712 --> 28:03.272
but they know that partner was Lucas Henry.

28:12.857 --> 28:16.418
You set us up.
You're in on this with Lucas Henry.

28:16.494 --> 28:20.089
This was a trap for Mulder
because he helped put you away.

28:20.165 --> 28:22.258
Well, I came here to tell you

28:22.333 --> 28:25.564
that if he dies because of what you've done,

28:25.670 --> 28:31.233
four days from now, nobody will stop me
from being the one that throws the switch

28:31.309 --> 28:35.336
and gases you out of this life for good,
you son of a bitch!!

28:36.347 --> 28:37.905
Dana,

28:37.982 --> 28:39.973
you're the one that believed me.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.582
No!

28:43.688 --> 28:45.747
No, I do not believe you!

28:48.193 --> 28:50.286
You don't believe me?

28:50.361 --> 28:52.454
Maybe you'll believe yourself.

29:04.776 --> 29:08.940
There was that one time
when I was fourteen

29:09.013 --> 29:11.106
and my parents had gone to bed.

29:11.182 --> 29:14.481
I snuck downstairs all alone

29:14.552 --> 29:19.319
and got one of my mom's cigarettes
and went out onto the porch in the dark.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.518
I was so scared.

29:24.429 --> 29:27.921
My heart was beating -
they would have killed me if they knew.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.931
But I was so excited.

29:34.105 --> 29:37.336
Not because of the cigarette -
I mean, it was gross -

29:37.408 --> 29:39.740
but because I wasn't supposed to.

29:44.415 --> 29:47.248
That could be a moment from any kid's life.

29:47.352 --> 29:51.812
I know what you want.
And I know who you wanna talk to.

29:53.992 --> 29:56.984
Why don't you just go ahead and ask me?

30:00.231 --> 30:03.132
I'll believe you

30:03.201 --> 30:07.160
if you let... me talk to him.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.673
Starbuck...

30:57.255 --> 30:59.780
No! No! No!

31:00.825 --> 31:05.819
No... body talks to anybody until I get a deal.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.266
Don't... underestimate my fear of dying,

31:13.338 --> 31:19.038
and don't downplay my terror
of going back to that chair.

31:20.445 --> 31:26.315
I know my hell's going to be to go on back to
that chair over and over again for all of time.

31:26.417 --> 31:30.444
But in this life, my one and only life,

31:30.521 --> 31:33.285
I don't ever want to go back again!

31:33.358 --> 31:34.916
Ever!

31:38.563 --> 31:42.659
The last time that I went to
death's door and looked inside...

31:42.734 --> 31:47.501
I ain't never talked to a minister before
in my life. Ever.

31:48.506 --> 31:50.565
Till that day.

31:50.675 --> 31:55.135
And he said, "He who doth not love

31:55.246 --> 31:57.305
remains in death."

31:58.683 --> 32:03.279
"And he who hates his brother...
is a murderer,

32:03.354 --> 32:06.687
and no murderer
has eternal life abiding in him."

32:08.059 --> 32:12.120
My family, who I killed after their last meal,

32:14.198 --> 32:17.065
was right there to watch me over mine.

32:18.803 --> 32:22.534
And their... fear

32:22.607 --> 32:25.075
and their horror

32:25.143 --> 32:29.307
that I made them feel when I killed them

32:29.380 --> 32:31.610
was injected into me!

32:31.716 --> 32:37.621
And their collective fear alone
was this long taste of hell.

32:41.926 --> 32:44.224
And then I felt myself leave my body.

32:46.097 --> 32:48.565
But I thought they'd already killed me.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.726
And I saw

32:51.602 --> 32:55.800
thousands of souls rushing at my body.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.608
It is a cold

33:04.716 --> 33:07.207
dark place, Scully.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.052
Mulder's looking in on it right now.

33:12.790 --> 33:15.315
It may be a cold, dark place for you,

33:17.028 --> 33:19.121
but it's not for Mulder.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.392
And it's not for my father.

33:21.466 --> 33:23.991
I'm sure he'd like to tell you hisself.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.161
But I'm not gonna let him.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.432
Nobody speaks till you give me a deal.

33:34.245 --> 33:36.008
I don't believe you.

33:36.180 --> 33:42.744
There's plenty of room in that cold,
dark place for liars, Scully.

33:44.722 --> 33:47.418
You go ahead and play it like you need to,

33:47.492 --> 33:49.483
but I know you believe me.

33:51.162 --> 33:55.155
But if you need to convince ajudge
I'm in on it with Lucas, go ahead.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.292
Cause either way,

33:57.402 --> 34:01.668
whether I'm running the show
with Lucas or I'm channeling,

34:01.773 --> 34:04.640
no information's coming till I get a deal.

34:04.709 --> 34:08.110
I got nothin' to lose!

34:11.649 --> 34:13.708
Guard!

34:15.786 --> 34:17.880
If I die,

34:18.456 --> 34:22.051
that boy goes to that cold, dark place.

34:48.953 --> 34:52.116
The Governor and
the Supreme Court of North Carolina

34:52.223 --> 34:55.123
do not intend to make a deal
with a mass murderer.

34:55.226 --> 34:59.026
Especially one who I know
is orchestrating a capital offense

34:59.097 --> 35:01.463
two days before his capital punishment.

35:01.532 --> 35:02.499
Yes, sir.

35:02.567 --> 35:05.365
All Boggs will get from me is a timely death.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.268
And it's an overdue one at that.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.906
We're running out of time.

35:16.981 --> 35:21.145
There's still no sign
of Lucas Henry or Jim Summers.

35:23.321 --> 35:27.485
- The Raleigh police said...
- No matter what, don't believe him.

35:29.393 --> 35:33.989
Boggs created this whole charade to
get back at me for putting him on death row.

35:37.668 --> 35:39.727
You'd be the next best thing.

35:41.005 --> 35:43.530
Mulder, I never thought I'd say this,

35:44.942 --> 35:47.570
but what if there's another explanation?

35:47.678 --> 35:50.476
Don't... deal with him.

35:53.417 --> 35:56.580
He could be trying to claim you
as his last victim.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.231
All right, Mr Boggs,

36:16.340 --> 36:18.570
you got your deal.

36:25.316 --> 36:27.375
Thank you, ma'am.

36:28.553 --> 36:30.646
Thank you.

36:32.723 --> 36:35.851
All right, where are they?

36:51.142 --> 36:53.872
Let's see, like...

36:56.180 --> 36:58.239
Circles.

36:59.283 --> 37:03.447
I don't know, like... barrels.

37:05.089 --> 37:07.182
No. No, bigger,

37:07.258 --> 37:12.161
like... huge... vats.

37:15.099 --> 37:17.192
Factory.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.963
Condemned.

37:19.036 --> 37:21.095
The

37:21.205 --> 37:23.264
Old... Blue...

37:24.709 --> 37:28.167
Devil Brewery, out by Morrisville.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.447
God, he's getting... he's getting ready.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.609
He... He...

37:34.685 --> 37:37.483
He's getting ready to...

37:39.857 --> 37:42.018
He's getting ready to kill the...

37:58.743 --> 38:00.870
Luther, if you really were psychic...

38:00.945 --> 38:03.243
I'd have known you lied.

38:04.215 --> 38:06.547
That there never was a deal.

38:06.651 --> 38:09.552
I know you tried.

38:15.159 --> 38:17.252
Scully.

38:18.562 --> 38:20.655
Avoid the Devil.

38:20.731 --> 38:23.461
Don't follow Henry to the Devil.

38:24.935 --> 38:27.165
Leave that to me.

39:07.111 --> 39:08.510
Freeze!

39:08.579 --> 39:10.410
Federal agents! We're armed!

39:12.550 --> 39:14.279
Drop your weapon.

39:44.448 --> 39:46.143
Go!

40:54.051 --> 40:57.043
You come to say goodbye?

40:59.023 --> 41:01.253
I believe...

41:03.661 --> 41:07.097
that if you had orchestrated
this kidnapping...

41:09.200 --> 41:14.934
Lucas Henry would have been aware
of the danger you warned me about.

41:16.941 --> 41:20.308
He never would have crossed that bridge.

41:22.613 --> 41:26.344
So you saved... Jim Summers' life.

41:31.922 --> 41:34.015
But you saved mine as well.

41:47.471 --> 41:50.099
You come for some unfinished business.

41:52.042 --> 41:54.101
You want your father's message.

41:56.313 --> 41:58.372
Not now.

41:59.884 --> 42:02.444
You be there tonight - my witness.

42:04.455 --> 42:07.083
When they got me in that chair and they...

42:08.926 --> 42:10.985
open up that shield...

42:14.532 --> 42:16.591
you'll get your message.

43:25.336 --> 43:29.170
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

43:29.239 --> 43:33.141
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth, as it is in heaven.

43:33.210 --> 43:36.043
Would you like to make a statement?

43:36.146 --> 43:40.412
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those that trespass against us.

43:40.484 --> 43:43.885
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil:

43:43.988 --> 43:47.617
For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory,

43:48.425 --> 43:51.155
for ever and ever. Amen.

44:04.241 --> 44:06.300
I was considering Boggs.

44:07.611 --> 44:10.045
If he knew that I was your partner,

44:10.981 --> 44:14.883
he could have found out everything
he knew about me - about my father...

44:14.985 --> 44:18.216
- Scully.
- Beyond The Sea played at their wedding.

44:18.288 --> 44:22.987
Visions of deceased loved ones are
a common psychological phenomenon.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.585
- If he knew that my father had...
- Dana.

44:27.031 --> 44:29.090
After all you've seen,

44:29.199 --> 44:31.258
after all the evidence,

44:31.335 --> 44:33.826
why can't you believe?

44:41.945 --> 44:44.038
I'm afraid.

44:46.216 --> 44:48.275
I'm afraid to believe.

44:49.920 --> 44:52.013
You couldn't face that fear?

44:53.157 --> 44:57.457
Even if it meant never knowing
what your father wanted to tell you?

45:00.130 --> 45:02.325
But I do know.

45:02.433 --> 45:04.162
How?

45:08.639 --> 45:10.834
He was my father.
