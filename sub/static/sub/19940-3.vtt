who's going bald on top?

With the greasy mustache...

Yeah, that guy.

02:00.390 --> 02:01.850
This blows my mind.

02:01.890 --> 02:04.020
I know, you know?
Then he says... get this...

02:04.060 --> 02:06.690
he says "So, the cash, now"
just like that.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.520
You know me,
I don't put up with shit,

02:08.560 --> 02:10.205
so I grab his knife and...
Do I owe you money?

02:10.229 --> 02:11.400
Sorry.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.820
Anyhow, I grab his knife and...

02:13.860 --> 02:15.490
I thought he'd move.

02:15.530 --> 02:16.740
Hey, everyone dies.

02:16.780 --> 02:17.900
Worst part was the blood.

02:17.950 --> 02:19.110
It was everywhere.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.320
On the walls, on the floor.

02:20.370 --> 02:21.530
I mean, look at this.

02:21.580 --> 02:22.910
He was like a fire hydrant.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.330
And I love this top.

02:24.370 --> 02:25.750
- Salt it.
- What?

02:25.790 --> 02:27.500
The stain.

02:27.540 --> 02:30.330
Salt it, then pour boiling water
on it till the water runs clear.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.750
Stain should be gone.

02:31.790 --> 02:33.130
Neat.

02:33.170 --> 02:35.760
Thanks.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.550

of salt everywhere.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.750
Uh... Carol.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.040
You had to think about it?

03:14.090 --> 03:15.300
- Janet?
- Wait.

03:15.340 --> 03:16.880
Do you not know who you are?

03:16.920 --> 03:18.970
- Not at the moment.
- Where is she?

03:19.010 --> 03:21.380
- Where's Miriam? -Look, this is
really about the kids.

03:21.430 --> 03:22.680
What about the kids?

03:22.720 --> 03:25.060
You know, I just blanked.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.946
But look, I just...
all I know is Midge is fine,

03:26.970 --> 03:29.116
she will pick up the kids later,
she's just gonna be late.

03:29.140 --> 03:30.560
Uh-huh.

MIDGE:
Lipstick, cigarettes...

03:39.190 --> 03:41.910
Hey, I had some
Necco Wafers in here.

03:41.950 --> 03:43.240
They're gone.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.410

that crime doesn't pay.

03:45.450 --> 03:46.870
You got a coat? It's cold out.

03:46.910 --> 03:49.910
Susie probably has it.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.290
- You're not Susie.
- Nope.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.500

heard some cute uptown chick
got arrested doing a set.

MIDGE: Hey, I thought
you were bailing me out.

04:22.860 --> 04:25.320
- What's wrong? -Your mother.
That's what's wrong.

04:25.370 --> 04:27.870
- So you called her. -Yeah,
I called her, and it was awful.

04:27.910 --> 04:30.176

How the hell does that happen?

04:30.200 --> 04:32.870

- I was Carol for a second,

then I was Donna or some shit,
then I was Mrs. Miniver

04:34.710 --> 04:36.040

04:36.080 --> 04:38.250
- Mrs. Miniver? From the movie?
- Yeah.

04:38.290 --> 04:39.840
She was spinning webs
around me, man,

to the Lindbergh kidnapping.

get bailed out by Lenny Bruce.

has blow job money

06:32.990 --> 06:35.160
She just waltzed in,
scooped up the kids,

06:35.200 --> 06:36.960
yelled "thanks" and left.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.080
No explanation.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.670
It was 1:15 in the morning.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.290
And it was cold last night.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.686
What does that have to do
with anything?

06:42.710 --> 06:44.250
Nothing, I'm just saying
it was cold.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.380
Where's the coffee?

06:45.420 --> 06:46.800
Why is there no coffee?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.010
Her hair was still wet,
like she just showered.

06:49.050 --> 06:50.640

06:50.680 --> 06:52.640
Where's Zelda?
Zelda's in charge of coffee.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.720
She's acting so strange
and different.

06:54.760 --> 06:55.890
ABE:
Why?

06:55.930 --> 06:57.730
Why? Her marriage, Abe.

06:57.770 --> 06:59.140
When did Zelda get married?

06:59.190 --> 07:01.480
- Not Zelda, your daughter.
- Oh, her.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.110
Yes, her. I know
it's a horrible time,

07:03.150 --> 07:05.190
but I don't know
what's going on with her.

07:05.230 --> 07:08.240
I don't know what she's doing
or where she's going.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.030
Yesterday, after that blow-up
at dinner, she just left.

07:11.070 --> 07:13.160
And she had a place to go.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.990
If I got mad at you
at 10:00 at night,

07:15.030 --> 07:16.716
and I walked out that door,
I would not have a place to go.

07:16.740 --> 07:17.846
I'd be standing
outside the door thinking,

07:17.870 --> 07:19.290
"I don't have a place to go."

07:19.330 --> 07:21.420
She walked out that door
and had a place to go.

07:21.460 --> 07:25.630
And that call from this strange
person, this "Mrs. Miniver."

07:25.670 --> 07:27.460
Mrs. Miniver? From the movie?

07:27.510 --> 07:29.220
Obviously it wasn't
Mrs. Miniver, Abe.

07:29.260 --> 07:30.930
Somebody stole my briefcase.

07:30.970 --> 07:33.340
Who is this person
that doesn't give me her name?

07:33.390 --> 07:35.760
That doesn't even seem to know
what she's calling about.

07:35.810 --> 07:37.770
She didn't even know
the kids' names.

07:37.810 --> 07:39.480
I even heard her crying
at one point.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.480
I was trying to get more
information out of her

07:41.520 --> 07:43.496
and I realized she wasn't even
on the other end of the phone,

07:43.520 --> 07:46.230
she had gone somewhere,
I was talking to myself.

07:46.270 --> 07:48.440
- Abe, are you listening?
- Yes!

07:48.480 --> 07:49.570
Then acknowledge me.

07:49.610 --> 07:51.400
Somebody really did
steal my briefcase.

07:51.450 --> 07:52.780
It's in the foyer.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.570
It shouldn't be there.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.830
This is not my relationship
with Miriam.

07:56.870 --> 07:58.660
This is not
how it's always been.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.660
I used to know all her friends.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.290
I used to know what she did.

08:02.330 --> 08:03.960
I used to know her mind.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.670
Now I know nothing.

08:05.710 --> 08:08.340
It was in the foyer.

08:10.380 --> 08:13.260
I'm very concerned about her.

08:15.300 --> 08:18.600
I have that thing tonight.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.310
(door opens and closes)

08:21.350 --> 08:23.350
(birds chirping)

08:37.409 --> 08:38.620
MIDGE:
It's the fourth time

08:38.659 --> 08:40.250
in three days.

08:40.289 --> 08:42.186
I wake up and he's just
standing there, staring at me.

08:42.210 --> 08:43.409
IMOGENE:
Spooky.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.040
MIDGE:
He's never done this.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.000
Well, it's pretty obvious
what this is about.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.550
- It is? -The man
whose name we do not speak.

08:49.590 --> 08:52.090
- You mean Joel? -I thought
we weren't speaking his name.

08:52.130 --> 08:54.590
He's living with you, Imogene,
how can you not speak his name?

08:54.630 --> 08:55.866
I'm just trying to be sensitive.

08:55.890 --> 08:57.050
I don't think that's it.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.680
I mean, Ethan's so young,

08:58.720 --> 09:01.180
and Joel was usually off
to work before he was even up.

09:01.220 --> 09:04.350
Oh, no, Ethan knows,
because kids know everything.

09:04.390 --> 09:06.036
They're like those monkeys
who know a tsunami's coming

09:06.060 --> 09:07.230
before everyone else.

09:07.270 --> 09:08.400
They know.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.520
Maybe.

09:09.570 --> 09:10.780
Well, what does Dr. Spock say?

09:10.820 --> 09:12.070
I don't know.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.546
Have you not consulted
your Dr. Spock?

09:13.570 --> 09:14.650
No.

09:14.700 --> 09:15.820
But you have Dr. Spock.

09:15.860 --> 09:17.070
I think so.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.700
Midge, have you not
read Dr. Spock?

09:18.740 --> 09:20.080
- I've skimmed it.
- Skimmed it?

09:20.120 --> 09:22.620
Midge, you don't skim Dr. Spock,

09:22.660 --> 09:26.460
you absorb Dr. Spock,
you inhale Dr. Spock.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.130
I mean, how are your children
even alive

09:28.170 --> 09:30.550
- and you have not read
Dr. Spock? -I'm not sure.

09:30.590 --> 09:33.420
It's everything you need to know
about raising children.

09:33.460 --> 09:34.840
I got my copy
the day I met Archie.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.550
I brought it along
on our second date.

09:36.590 --> 09:37.970
He was surprised.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.100
Oh, shoot,
I'm talking about Archie.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.600
- So?
- He's my husband.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.180
Yes, I know, I know Archie.

09:43.220 --> 09:44.496
But I wasn't going to say
the "H" word.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.440
- You can say it.
- You're getting upset.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.706
- I'm not getting upset.
- You're mad at me

09:47.730 --> 09:49.126
- that we took him in.
- I'm not mad at you,

09:49.150 --> 09:51.086
- it's not your fault. -How could
it possibly be my fault?

09:51.110 --> 09:52.650
- I said that it wasn't.
- It's not.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.650
- Okay. -So you're fine
with this whole situation?

09:54.690 --> 09:56.110
Well, I'm not loving it.

09:56.150 --> 09:57.660
I knew it. You hate me.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.466
- I don't hate you.
- You're ganging up on me.

09:59.490 --> 10:00.990
There's one of me, Imogene.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.990
One person cannot gang up
on someone. That's math.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.540
- You sound mad.
- I know.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.620
I'm sorry.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.620
I hate Joel.

10:08.670 --> 10:11.630
I resigned as president
of his fan club yesterday.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.800
(piano playing)

10:13.840 --> 10:16.670
Hello.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.130
Hello? Mama?

10:18.180 --> 10:19.550
Coming.

10:19.590 --> 10:21.390
Oh, hello, handsome.

10:21.430 --> 10:23.560
Oh, you look nice. Chanel?

10:23.600 --> 10:24.640
Jacques Fath.

10:24.680 --> 10:25.730
- New?
- Kind of.

10:25.770 --> 10:27.850
Pretty. Where are you off to?

10:27.890 --> 10:29.690
Dentist.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.520
So, Esther's got
an ear infection again.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.770
That's because her forehead

10:32.820 --> 10:34.046
is putting pressure
on her eardrums.

10:34.070 --> 10:35.530
Did you tell the doctor that?

10:35.570 --> 10:37.256
MIDGE: I will mention it
next time I see him.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.360
Abe, Miriam is here.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.610
I see her.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.160
Fancy outfit for a dentist.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.660
Is Joel going to be there?

10:44.700 --> 10:46.120
No, he's not.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.726
I'm putting the exact amount
in each bottle

10:47.750 --> 10:48.766
so you don't have
to think about it.

10:48.790 --> 10:50.460
So, where is Joel staying?

10:50.500 --> 10:52.920
He is staying
with Archie and Imogene.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.130
Oh, that's good.

10:54.170 --> 10:55.590
Why is that good, Mama?

10:55.630 --> 10:57.066
Well, at least he's not
living with that girl.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.050
If the baby wakes up,

10:58.090 --> 10:59.590
it's a drop in each ear,

10:59.630 --> 11:01.486
and don't let her wriggle
for a full minute after.

11:01.510 --> 11:04.470
I just put her hands under her
tush and sit on her lightly.

11:04.510 --> 11:05.890
Miriam, wait.

11:05.930 --> 11:08.270
- Miriam.
- Mama, I'm late.

11:08.310 --> 11:10.980
Hear me out because if he's
not living with that girl,

11:11.020 --> 11:12.730
maybe it's not so serious.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.070
You said he was in love
with her, but maybe he's not.

11:15.110 --> 11:16.440
Maybe you should
give him a call.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.070
Abe, what do you think?

11:18.110 --> 11:19.716
ABE: I told everybody
what I thought should happen

11:19.740 --> 11:21.086
and everybody
completely ignored me.

11:21.110 --> 11:22.780
That's not true.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.216
Or maybe you should go have
dinner with your friends,

11:24.240 --> 11:25.950
Archie and Imogene,
at their place tonight.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.516
Don't let Ethan bring his
Lincoln Logs near the playpen.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.040
Esther eats them.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.516
I mean, they're your friends
as much as Joel's.

11:30.540 --> 11:32.250
- Right, Abe?
- ABE: Ibid!

11:32.290 --> 11:34.130
- MIDGE: I've got to go.
- What? Miriam!

11:34.170 --> 11:35.840
I'll be back later
this afternoon.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.760
Don't forget to sit on the baby.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.560
MAN:
Pardon me.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.310
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

11:52.350 --> 11:54.690
Is-is this Christopher Street?

11:54.730 --> 11:56.480
Yes? No?

11:56.520 --> 11:58.110
God, yeah.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.150
(siren wailing in distance)

12:04.160 --> 12:05.780
- Hey.
- Give it to me.

12:05.830 --> 12:08.160
MAN: The judge doesn't know
what he's talking about.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.910
How do I know?

12:09.950 --> 12:13.370
I've only litigated in front of
the man, like, a thousand times.

12:13.420 --> 12:15.960
No, not literally, smart-ass.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.250
Uh, it's a figure of speech.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.800
Sorry, is this
a lawyer's office?

12:22.840 --> 12:24.010
Yes, it is.

12:24.050 --> 12:25.470
Smells like mildew.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.720
Well, that could be me.
What's with the duds?

12:27.760 --> 12:29.560
You got a shoot
with Harper's Bazaar later?

12:29.600 --> 12:31.850
I always dress nicely
for important meetings.

12:31.890 --> 12:33.706
When Joel and I met our co-op
board for the first time,

12:33.730 --> 12:34.996
I made the mistake
of wearing pedal pushers

12:35.020 --> 12:37.270
and they made us
come back three times.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.570
Is that a sandwich?

12:38.610 --> 12:39.820
It used to be.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.490
Here, come. Sit.

12:41.530 --> 12:44.320
No, no, listen, Lizanne,
Terminiello v. Chicago.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.990
Douglas says the function
of free speech

12:47.030 --> 12:48.830
is to invite dispute!

12:48.870 --> 12:51.620
Yeah, that's fucking poetry,
goddamn it.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.870
I say so, too.
I'll call you later.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.120
You're my 11:00?

12:55.170 --> 12:56.580
- MIDGE: Yes, sir.
- Susie, right?

12:56.630 --> 12:59.090
Yeah, and this is Miriam Maisel,
Michael Kessler.

12:59.130 --> 13:00.710
You going somewhere after this?

13:00.760 --> 13:01.880
Country club? White House?

13:01.920 --> 13:03.260
I dressed for the meeting.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.656
You dressed for the meeting.
(snorts)

13:04.680 --> 13:06.156
(laughing):
She dressed for the meeting.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.850
I dress for important meetings.

13:07.890 --> 13:09.156
Well, you've come
to the wrong place.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.140
You like that?

13:11.180 --> 13:12.770
Kirk Douglas gave me that.

13:12.810 --> 13:14.286
He used it when he played
Van Gogh in that movie.

13:14.310 --> 13:16.810
Really? W-Wow.
I-I love Kirk Douglas.

13:16.850 --> 13:18.690
I worked pro Bono for his pal,
Trumbo,

13:18.730 --> 13:20.370
when he refused to name names
to Congress.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.440
You worked on that?

13:21.480 --> 13:22.626
Oh, Michael here
has defended them all.

13:22.650 --> 13:23.860
Mainly constitutional things.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.860
Yeah, Jim Crow, he's on it.

13:25.910 --> 13:27.676
- Voting rights, he's on it.
- What's happening with voting?

13:27.700 --> 13:30.120
Besides states keeping Negroes
from the polls, you mean?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.450
Yeah, Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg, he was on their team.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.700
Took four zaps in the chair

13:33.750 --> 13:35.120
to kill poor Ethel.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.960
There was smoke
coming out of her ears.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.646
Ah, Jewish women are known
to be more difficult.

13:38.670 --> 13:40.380
This is really fascinating.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.186
I'm-I'm gonna read up on all
this stuff when I get home.

13:42.210 --> 13:43.670
You mean right after
your cotillion?

13:43.710 --> 13:44.840
- My what?
- (snorts)

13:44.880 --> 13:46.550
(laughs)
I'm just joking.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.050
You are dressed very fancy.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.680
All right,
let's see what we got here.

13:49.720 --> 13:53.100
"Performing without
a cabaret license." Bullshit.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.640
"Public indecency."

13:54.680 --> 13:56.270
You said stuff
to make a nun blush,

13:56.310 --> 13:57.916
but you didn't say it
in a convent, I'm assuming.

13:57.940 --> 13:59.230
I was not in a convent.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.980
- So, where's the crime?
- Right.

14:01.020 --> 14:04.190
Wow. "Simulating a sex act
while on stage."

14:04.240 --> 14:05.546
"Sex act"? What?
That's-that's ridiculous.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.450
Yeah, I would've
remembered that.

14:07.490 --> 14:08.586
Says something here
about miming a whore

14:08.610 --> 14:09.950
tickling a man's testicles.

14:09.990 --> 14:11.256
- Oh, I did do that.
- Oh, yeah, she did.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.660
It was fucking funny.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.330
And apparently,
you exposed your breasts.

14:14.370 --> 14:15.580
I do not remember that.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.540
I do, and I got
to tell you, Mike,

14:17.580 --> 14:19.186
when she whipped those
things out, I ducked.

14:19.210 --> 14:20.766
I'm telling you, boy,
they were glowing.

14:20.790 --> 14:23.050
It was like a Mack truck
was coming at me. It killed.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.840
- We will fight it all.
- MIDGE: Good.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.986
I would like
to be found innocent.

14:26.010 --> 14:27.380
I would like that, too.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.010
Cops that hang out around
outside clubs

14:29.050 --> 14:30.430
waiting to harass entertainers

14:30.470 --> 14:32.470
for doing their thing,
I hate that.

14:32.510 --> 14:33.810
Passionately.

14:33.850 --> 14:35.270
You start controlling speech,

14:35.310 --> 14:36.890
you're slip-sliding
toward fascism,

14:36.930 --> 14:38.440
and we saw how that turned out.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.496
MIDGE:
Great. You're hired.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.150
It's kind of up to him.

14:41.190 --> 14:44.190
The meeting is more
to get him to do it.

14:44.230 --> 14:46.280
Oh. Will you do it?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.990
For nothing?

14:48.030 --> 14:49.950
If you had just dressed
for the meeting.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.006
- (telephone ringing)
- Thank you.

14:51.030 --> 14:52.700
Thank you, Mr. Kessler.

14:52.740 --> 14:55.240
Kessler.

14:55.290 --> 14:56.970
Yeah, Tom, I told you
to call me yesterday.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.750
No, this is not
about the Rikers thing.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.306
This is about the Jersey thing.
Hang on, hang on.

15:00.330 --> 15:01.630
The outfit...

15:01.670 --> 15:02.840
You will not see it again.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.050
No, no, no. Wear it to court.

15:04.090 --> 15:06.050
It was an illegal search.

15:06.090 --> 15:07.590
How? They had no warrant

15:07.630 --> 15:09.300
and they busted his door in,
that's how.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.930
Thank you, Jerry.

15:28.940 --> 15:30.860
Rose?

15:30.910 --> 15:33.570
Shh.

15:33.620 --> 15:35.620
(sighs)

15:37.910 --> 15:40.960
(quietly): I want to work
on these signs with you.

15:50.130 --> 15:51.510
Rose?

15:51.550 --> 15:56.390
Rose... can I get you anything?

15:58.600 --> 16:01.480
No.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.480
Rose...

16:03.520 --> 16:05.270
I just...

16:05.310 --> 16:10.360
I just have to let this pass.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.990
All right.

16:12.030 --> 16:15.120
I'll be in my study.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.660
ROSE:
Our daughter is in trouble,

16:18.700 --> 16:22.750
and you're not doing
anything about it.

16:29.710 --> 16:31.760
So, it's my understanding,
Mr. Kennedy,

16:31.800 --> 16:33.260
that your client
is pleading guilty

16:33.300 --> 16:35.180
to drunk and disorderly conduct,

16:35.220 --> 16:37.970
including obstruction
of pedestrian traffic.

16:38.010 --> 16:39.680
Guy in the yellow shirt.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.140
- You ready?
- Yeah.

16:41.180 --> 16:43.440
One, two, three.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.020
- Rapist.
- Confidence trickster.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.270
Confidence trickster?

16:46.310 --> 16:47.520
Who are you, Charles Dickens?

16:47.570 --> 16:49.150
He is not a rapist.

16:49.190 --> 16:50.740
He looks pretty rapey to me.

16:50.780 --> 16:52.400
I'm going with con man.

16:52.450 --> 16:53.900
Or arsonist.

16:53.950 --> 16:56.740
You can't change your answer.

16:56.780 --> 16:58.216
All right, orange tie,
crappy suit. Ready?

16:58.240 --> 16:59.990
- Yeah.
- One, two, three.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.620
- Pickpocket.
- Horse fucker.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.370
I thought we were
really playing.

17:03.410 --> 17:05.710
No, I'm telling you,
that guy has fucked a horse.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.089
Got the judge to drop
the cabaret license thing.

17:08.130 --> 17:09.880
- Oh, great.
- Yes, thank you.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.970
He's in kind of a pissy mood,
so let me do the heavy lifting.

17:13.010 --> 17:14.930
Gladly.

17:14.970 --> 17:16.339
- (gavel bangs)
- Next case.

17:16.390 --> 17:17.550
Docket number 4623.

17:17.599 --> 17:18.890
Miriam Maisel,

17:18.930 --> 17:20.430
charged with 1140A
of the penal law.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.020
Tits up.

17:22.060 --> 17:24.390
Miriam Maisel, you are charged

17:24.440 --> 17:26.230
with 1140A of the penal law.

17:26.270 --> 17:28.440
While performing
in a licensed venue,

17:28.480 --> 17:32.820
you presented and participated
in an obscene, indecent tableau.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.360
Uh, who is presiding
as the prosecutor?

17:37.410 --> 17:39.200
Leon Cranmer, on behalf
of the People, Judge.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.330
Uh-huh, and for the defense?

17:41.370 --> 17:42.676
Good morning, Your Honor,
Michael Kessler.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.260
- And may I address the court?
- (sighs)

17:44.290 --> 17:46.170
- Yes, Mr. Kessler.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

17:46.210 --> 17:49.710
Your Honor, Mrs. Maisel is
as she appears before you:

17:49.750 --> 17:52.840
an upstanding citizen
with a spotless record.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.340
She is married with two
beautiful preschool children.

17:55.380 --> 17:57.430
She's a graduate of Bryn Mawr

17:57.470 --> 17:59.430
and is enormously respected
in her community.

17:59.470 --> 18:00.810
A list of people

18:00.850 --> 18:02.810
willing to vouch
for her fine character

18:02.850 --> 18:04.560
would be as long as your arm.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.100
A list that would include
the venerable Rabbi Wasserman

18:07.140 --> 18:08.440
of Temple Shearith Israel.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.270
But most importantly,

18:10.310 --> 18:12.070
and I cannot stress
this strongly enough,

18:12.110 --> 18:14.990
there is no way
this activity would recur.

18:15.030 --> 18:17.450
This was a blip, an anomaly.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.410
It will never happen again.

18:19.450 --> 18:20.700
But it already has.

18:20.740 --> 18:21.830
KESSLER:
I'm sorry?

18:21.870 --> 18:23.200
Isn't this her second arrest?

18:23.240 --> 18:24.750
Yes, but, Your Honor...

18:24.790 --> 18:26.386
Regardless of that, Your Honor,
there's no denying

18:26.410 --> 18:29.040
that Mrs. Maisel is
an honorable, respectable woman,

18:29.080 --> 18:31.210
and we are asking that
these charges be dismissed.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.460
JUDGE:
Mm-hmm.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.380
Is your husband
in the courtroom?

18:34.420 --> 18:35.840
Who, me?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.800
I don't believe Mr. Kessler
has a husband.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.316
Is your husband
in the courtroom, ma'am?

18:39.340 --> 18:41.100
No.

18:41.140 --> 18:42.720
Well, I'm surprised by that.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.140
He's at work.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.310
Well, this is a serious matter,
little lady.

18:46.350 --> 18:48.690
So I'm curious as to why
he didn't take the morning off

18:48.730 --> 18:50.400
to help you deal with this.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.650
Well, maybe he thought
I could handle it on my own.

18:53.690 --> 18:56.610
Yes, Mr. Maisel is a busy man,
and I see no reason

18:56.650 --> 18:59.700
to use up any more of your
valuable time, Your Honor.

18:59.740 --> 19:03.370
The language chronicled in
these incidents, ma'am, crude.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.910
- Lewd.
- Well, I...

19:04.950 --> 19:06.950
And also hearsay, Your Honor,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.830
reported by an obviously
overzealous police officer.

19:09.870 --> 19:11.750
Effectively,
this was entrapment.

19:11.790 --> 19:12.856
Mr. Kessler,
we don't need to hear

19:12.880 --> 19:14.090
how much you hate the police.

19:14.130 --> 19:15.750
I don't hate the police,
Your Honor,

19:15.800 --> 19:18.090
but I would like to point out
that no other witness

19:18.130 --> 19:21.430
has stepped forward to make
any sort of complaint.

19:21.470 --> 19:22.970
Mrs. Maisel,
we all slip sometimes.

19:23.010 --> 19:24.140
Would you agree to that?

19:24.180 --> 19:26.350
Yes, Your Honor.

19:26.390 --> 19:28.930
But the court does acknowledge
your standing in the community,

19:28.980 --> 19:31.020
your lack of prior arrests.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.690
You're certainly packaged right.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.610
Thank you?

19:34.650 --> 19:36.610
In many ways, it's our culture
that's slipping.

19:36.650 --> 19:39.070
Shirley Temple is
a thing of the past.

19:39.110 --> 19:40.670
- Too bad.
- Shirley Temple, Your Honor?

19:40.700 --> 19:43.120
Surely, Your Honor,
these are salient points.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.160
Now, I'll consider dismissal
after some assurance

19:45.200 --> 19:47.160
that you'll no longer engage
in actions

19:47.200 --> 19:48.950
to the detriment
of the moral health

19:49.000 --> 19:50.370
of those around you.

19:50.410 --> 19:53.170
- Moral health? Oh, come on.
- Excuse me.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.356
- Your Honor... -Look,
ev-everyone in that audience

19:54.380 --> 19:55.920
was so plastered,
they didn't know

19:55.960 --> 19:57.646
- what the hell was going on,
anyway. -What was that?

19:57.670 --> 19:59.856
It's a coffee house, it's just
coffee, there's no booze.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.856
- Sit down, young man.
- Well, at least he said "young."

20:01.880 --> 20:03.656
Your Honor, emotions are running
a little high here...

20:03.680 --> 20:05.970
And what exactly was wrong
with the words I said?

20:06.010 --> 20:07.560
What's the crime there?

20:07.600 --> 20:10.310
The language you used was foul,
indisputably.

20:10.350 --> 20:12.560
But what's the difference
between me saying those words

20:12.600 --> 20:14.206
on a stage to an audience
that's there to hear them,

20:14.230 --> 20:16.110
and a bunch of guys
saying shit loud enough

20:16.150 --> 20:19.190
- for everybody to hear at P.J.
Clarke's? -What did you say?

20:19.230 --> 20:20.666
With everything
that's going on out there,

20:20.690 --> 20:22.990
Jim Crow laws, voter fraud,

20:23.030 --> 20:25.700
you're taking the time
to pick on a "little lady"?

20:25.740 --> 20:27.120
That's bullshit.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.580
- (crowd gasping)
- Mrs. Maisel!

20:28.620 --> 20:30.910
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg
were framed!

20:30.960 --> 20:32.460
(door locks)

20:32.500 --> 20:34.080
- Thanks, Judy.
- You got it.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.840
Contempt of court fine
is $200. Cash.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.090
Can't you talk him out of it?

20:39.130 --> 20:40.260
This isn't Perry Mason.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.670
I have to go to the bathroom.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.510
They'll let you use
the bathroom.

20:43.550 --> 20:45.366
Have you seen the bathroom?
I'm not using that bathroom.

20:45.390 --> 20:47.526
Well, then you're gonna have to
hold it until you pay the money.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.180
- What a scam...
- And go back into court

20:49.220 --> 20:51.180
- and apologize to the judge.
- No way.

20:51.230 --> 20:53.116
- I'm not apologizing.
- Then you're staying here.

20:53.140 --> 20:55.230
I can't stay here,
I have to pick up my son.

20:55.270 --> 20:57.650
Then you got to pay $200
and apologize to the judge.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.980
Not until he apologizes to me.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.400
Then you're staying here.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.450
(phone ringing)

21:03.490 --> 21:05.070
Hello.

21:05.110 --> 21:06.740
- MIDGE: Joel.
- Midge?

21:06.780 --> 21:08.620
What's-what's wrong?
Are the kids okay?

21:08.660 --> 21:10.540
Yes. Listen...

21:10.580 --> 21:14.160
I'm gonna ask you for something
and I need you to say yes.

21:14.210 --> 21:15.750
I need $200.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.170
In cash.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.420
- And I need it in the next hour.
- What?

21:19.460 --> 21:20.920
A man is gonna pick it up.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.760
Please don't ask him who he is.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.970
And please never ask me
what the money's for.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.526
- Just give it to him.
- (jail cell door opens)

21:26.550 --> 21:28.350
Wait... where are you?

21:28.390 --> 21:30.220
- Don't ask me that either.
- "Don't ask"?

21:30.260 --> 21:32.640
Well, what the hell
can I ask you, Midge? I mean...

21:32.680 --> 21:34.616
Y-You call me up out of the blue
asking for money,

21:34.640 --> 21:36.320
I can't ask you this,
I can't ask you that,

21:36.350 --> 21:38.190
I don't know if you're hurt,
or you're sick,

21:38.230 --> 21:41.070
or there's a fat guy in back
of you with a gun to your head.

21:41.110 --> 21:42.416
It's crazy, I'm having
a heart attack here.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.530
What do you want me to do?

21:43.570 --> 21:45.280
Joel?

21:47.700 --> 21:49.700
- One hour.
- Thank you.

Gracing the floors
of my humble business?

22:30.070 --> 22:31.950
- How are you, Abe?
- I'm good, Moishe!

22:31.990 --> 22:34.370
When was the last time you were
south of Central Park, Abe?

22:34.410 --> 22:35.790
Was Roosevelt still president?

22:35.830 --> 22:37.160
It's been a while, Moishe.

22:37.210 --> 22:38.790
You too busy to talk?

22:38.830 --> 22:40.500
For you? Never. Get down here.

22:40.540 --> 22:42.540
Please, tell me

22:42.590 --> 22:45.630
you've come to let me fit you
for a decent suit.

22:45.670 --> 22:47.606
My God, Abe, I've been trying
to get you out of tweeds

22:47.630 --> 22:48.760
since Hector was a pup.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.090
I'm not here for a suit, Moishe.

22:50.140 --> 22:51.890
Or something for Rosie, then.

22:51.930 --> 22:53.536
Not that I've ever seen her
wear the same thing twice.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.140
She has plenty of clothes.

22:55.180 --> 22:56.560
Well, then, what?

22:56.600 --> 22:59.520
- Well...
- It's about dinner. I know.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.730
It was a terrible night.
I'm sorry it took that turn.

23:01.770 --> 23:03.360
All that yelling,
all that emotion.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.586
- It was very emotional.
- Well, you try to make someone

23:05.610 --> 23:07.296
do the right thing,
doesn't always work out.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.860
- Moishe...
- Uh-oh.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.700
Serious face.
Easter Island face.

23:10.740 --> 23:12.320
I know that face.

23:12.370 --> 23:13.740
I was wondering,
is there any way

23:13.780 --> 23:15.410
I can get you
to change your mind

23:15.450 --> 23:17.450
- about taking back
the apartment? -Nope. No way.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.620
- I paid for it.
I overpaid for it. -I know.

23:19.670 --> 23:21.500
It was mine to take back.
My son knew this.

23:21.540 --> 23:22.976
- I'm sure he did.
- So what's the point here, Abe?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.590
Why are you even
bringing this up?

23:24.630 --> 23:27.050
- I want to get the kids
back together. -Join the club.

23:27.090 --> 23:28.856
And the apartment is
a big piece of that puzzle.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.300
I've already put it
on the market.

23:30.340 --> 23:31.890
You can take it off the market.

23:31.930 --> 23:33.430
People are gonna
love the layout,

23:33.470 --> 23:34.760
and it's so close to the park.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.520
I'll pay for half the apartment.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.770
What do you mean,
you'll pay for half?

23:38.810 --> 23:40.230
So, we're each in 50-50.

23:40.270 --> 23:41.770
Co-owners.

23:41.810 --> 23:43.400
Then, we keep it available

23:43.440 --> 23:45.980
if and when Joel and Miriam
get back together.

23:46.020 --> 23:48.110
Hmm. 50-50, huh?

23:48.150 --> 23:49.400
Yes.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.820
Like we did the temple seats.

23:51.860 --> 23:53.280
Yes.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.870
Just like we did
the temple seats.

23:55.910 --> 23:57.266
And you can swing that?
Place ain't cheap.

23:57.290 --> 23:58.476
- I can swing it.
- You can swing for that,

23:58.500 --> 24:00.040
but not for a better suit?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.396
- My suits are fine, Moishe.
- Your suits are old.

24:01.420 --> 24:02.750
My suits are good.

24:04.330 --> 24:07.050
(sighs)
You know...

24:07.090 --> 24:09.090
- Ah, I shouldn't say it.
- No.

24:09.130 --> 24:10.380
No, go ahead, say it.

24:10.420 --> 24:11.736
I never thought
you liked me so much.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.340
No. I like you
very much, Moishe.

24:14.390 --> 24:16.600
I don't know. We invite
you over, you never come.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.020
Well, school keeps me busy.

24:19.060 --> 24:20.560
Shirley never sees
enough of Rosie.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.206
- That we should fix...
- And maybe it's me,

24:22.230 --> 24:24.650
but you always seemed
to have a weird attitude

24:24.690 --> 24:26.900
whenever I brought up the 13.

24:26.940 --> 24:28.540
- You know what
I'm talking about? -Uh...

24:28.570 --> 24:30.780
The 13 people I got
out of Germany in '43...

24:30.820 --> 24:33.200
No, I know who they are...

24:33.240 --> 24:36.370
At great cost, at great
sacrifice, I did that, Abe.

24:36.410 --> 24:39.490
I have nothing but admiration
for the great sacrifice you made

24:39.540 --> 24:41.750
to get those poor people
out of Germany, Moishe.

24:41.790 --> 24:44.630
- You do?
- Yes, very much.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.130
Good. Good.

24:49.170 --> 24:52.720
I'll take the offer, 50-50,
for the kids.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.130
Thank you, Moishe.

24:54.180 --> 24:55.510
Look at this.

24:55.550 --> 24:57.220
- Huh?
- Look at this! Come here!

24:57.260 --> 24:58.640
- Oh. Okay.
- (laughs)

24:58.680 --> 25:00.270
- You and me on the same side!
- Uh-huh.

25:00.310 --> 25:02.430
- The Allies planning D-Day.
- Yeah, yes.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.770
And who's gonna stop us, huh?

25:03.810 --> 25:04.996
- No one's gonna stop us, Moishe.
- No.

25:05.020 --> 25:06.480
No one's gonna stop us.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.770
- No. -Hey, wait a minute,
wait, here we go.

25:08.820 --> 25:11.400
Take this for Rosie.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.216
- No, really, Moishe... -When was
the last time you came home

25:13.240 --> 25:15.006
- with a gift for your wife?
- Fairly recently.

25:15.030 --> 25:17.490
- Take it. -All right,
fine, fine, but here's some...

25:17.530 --> 25:19.306
What are you, crazy?
Your money's no good here.

25:19.330 --> 25:21.120
All right.
Now, that's very nice of you,

25:21.160 --> 25:22.426
but this is your
business, and...

25:22.450 --> 25:24.290
Oh, no, I wouldn't hear of it.

25:24.330 --> 25:26.040
(laughing):
Well.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.920
Thank you for the coat, Moishe.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.840
Now we just have to figure out

25:37.890 --> 25:39.550
how to get Joel
to the next step.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.640
- Oh, Joel will come back.
- What do you mean?

25:41.680 --> 25:43.270
I mean, I know my son.

25:43.310 --> 25:44.786
Follow-through's
never been his strong suit.

25:44.810 --> 25:48.150
Tell Rosie not to worry,
he'll be back.

25:49.650 --> 25:51.190
Partners!

25:51.230 --> 25:52.650
Ha, ha.

25:52.690 --> 25:54.190
Yeah, Tuesday's fine.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.240
I got a 4:00 call,
then I'm in the clear.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.660
Hey, who else is gonna...

26:01.330 --> 26:02.950
Al, let me call you back.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.290
Mr. Maisel.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.460
Yes?

26:23.310 --> 26:24.560
She's okay?

26:24.600 --> 26:27.020
She's okay.

26:33.980 --> 26:35.690
Welcome back, Mrs. Maisel.

26:35.740 --> 26:38.110
I see that you've posted payment
on your fine,

26:38.160 --> 26:41.660
and that you have something
you'd like to say to the court.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.450
Yes, Your Honor.

26:43.490 --> 26:47.290
My behavior earlier today
was irrational.

26:47.330 --> 26:48.960
JUDGE:
Could you speak up, please?

26:50.630 --> 26:52.790
My behavior earlier today

26:52.840 --> 26:57.340
was irrational, irresponsible

26:57.380 --> 27:00.260
and extremely disrespectful.

27:00.300 --> 27:03.350
I let my emotions
get the better of me.

27:03.390 --> 27:06.020
After all, I am a woman.

27:06.060 --> 27:09.190
And therefore,
I humbly apologize.

27:09.230 --> 27:11.610
Good, good.

27:11.650 --> 27:14.400
Now my original inclination
was to dismiss these charges,

27:14.440 --> 27:18.990
but in view of what happened
here today, I offer this:

27:19.030 --> 27:22.490
plead guilty, and you'll
be sentenced to time served.

27:22.530 --> 27:24.700
Otherwise, you can risk trial,

27:24.740 --> 27:27.370
where the maximum fine
will be a thousand dollars

27:27.410 --> 27:29.410
and up to three months in jail.

27:29.460 --> 27:31.880
- Three months?
- Now, as you consider this,

27:31.920 --> 27:33.880
please think long and hard

27:33.920 --> 27:36.340
about how generous
I'm feeling right now,

27:36.380 --> 27:41.010
and about how easy it would be
to make me angry again.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.970
I plead guilty, Your Honor.

27:45.010 --> 27:46.430
JUDGE:
Good!

27:46.470 --> 27:48.230
The defendant pleads guilty
on all counts,

27:48.270 --> 27:50.730
and she is sentenced
to time served.

27:50.770 --> 27:51.900
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:51.940 --> 27:53.400
Yes, thank you, Your Honor.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.820
You're welcome, Mrs. Maisel.
And by the way,

27:55.860 --> 27:58.440
that is a lovely dress
you are wearing.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.660
Hang on to my card.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.950
Uh, I think
you're gonna need it.

28:05.990 --> 28:09.290
I'm burning this dress
when I get home.

28:09.330 --> 28:11.790
Oh, God, I'm gonna be
so late for Ethan.

28:11.830 --> 28:14.880
Hey, get this: the horse fucker
was a flasher, so I was close.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.550
- Susie.
- Huh?

28:17.590 --> 28:19.880
- Tell me it's gonna work.
- What?

28:19.920 --> 28:23.090
This comedy thing,
I'm-I'm staking a lot on it.

28:23.140 --> 28:26.220
It's gonna affect
my whole family, it has to work.

28:26.260 --> 28:27.510
Of course it's gonna work.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.520
No, I mean,
it really has to work.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.140
Miriam, it's okay.

28:32.190 --> 28:34.030
I have been gearing up for this
my entire life.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.150
I have got a plan.
It is long term,

28:36.190 --> 28:39.110
and I swear to you,
it is gonna work.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.710
JOEL:
All right, just keep in mind

28:56.750 --> 28:58.726
that Dow Chemical always slows
down around the holidays.

28:58.750 --> 29:01.420
So, someone should drop by
their Jersey plant, like now,

29:01.470 --> 29:03.550
to see them in person,
check in on the pipeline.

29:03.590 --> 29:05.180
Please don't make me
go to Jersey.

29:05.220 --> 29:06.340
Don, you're going to Jersey.

29:06.390 --> 29:07.640
Oh, I don't get a say?

29:07.680 --> 29:08.866
Seniority counts
for something, Donny.

29:08.890 --> 29:10.350
They like us there.

29:10.390 --> 29:11.956
Let them show you around,
take you to lunch.

29:11.980 --> 29:13.140
Just don't get too drunk.

29:13.190 --> 29:14.390
Ha! Good luck with that.

29:14.440 --> 29:15.730
Help Don out on his travel?

29:15.770 --> 29:17.400
Certainly.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.190
- Come back a conqueror.
- You got it, boss.

29:20.230 --> 29:22.280
- Hey, you up for a drink?
- Can't.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.006
The missus talked me into
bowling with some couples

29:24.030 --> 29:25.570
from her literary
improvements club.

29:25.610 --> 29:27.200
- Ouch.
- Tag along.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.056
You and I can drink and
they can all keep pretending

29:29.080 --> 29:30.426
they liked
The World of Suzie Wong.

29:30.450 --> 29:32.250
- I'll pass.
- I figured.

29:32.290 --> 29:34.250
Hey, if you don't eat
before you get home,

29:34.290 --> 29:35.806
Imogene left you some meatloaf
in the fridge.

29:35.830 --> 29:37.606
- Oh, I'll be fine.
- Sitter will be there at 7:00,

29:37.630 --> 29:39.146
but she knows
you got first dibs on the TV.

29:39.170 --> 29:41.250
Yeah, listen, Arch, you know,

29:41.300 --> 29:42.736
I'm not gonna be
on your couch forever.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.236
- I promise.
- What are you talking about?

29:44.260 --> 29:45.510
This is great.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.050
You're like the pet
we never had.

29:47.090 --> 29:49.550
Yeah, well, I'm working on
a plan, just so you know.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.220
Sure, sure.
Get your own place.

29:51.260 --> 29:52.446
You get your name up in lights.

29:52.470 --> 29:53.640
What?

29:53.680 --> 29:55.140
Joel Maisel, king of comedy.

29:55.190 --> 29:58.360
Oh, yeah, right.
Well, we'll see about that.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.730
Let's get Mason's sign-off
over at Dow

30:00.770 --> 30:02.126
and then we can talk
about king of comedy.

30:02.150 --> 30:03.400
Okay. Oh, hey.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.740
Uh, for the sitter.

30:05.780 --> 30:07.240
All right.
Bowling alley's in Jersey.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.240
- There's no escaping Jersey.
- (chuckles)

30:09.280 --> 30:10.530
Mr. Maisel.

30:10.580 --> 30:12.580
Yes, Mrs. Moskowitz?

30:12.620 --> 30:15.250
It's Penny on the line, again.

30:15.290 --> 30:18.040
Tell her I left already.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.420
Yes, sir.

30:21.090 --> 30:23.090
(upbeat jazz music playing)

30:29.550 --> 30:31.640
(audience laughing)

30:34.310 --> 30:35.850
LENNY:
Let me explain it to you.

30:35.890 --> 30:37.890
Let me explain Jewish
and goyish to you.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.150
I'll show you how it works.

30:39.190 --> 30:41.860
Uh, Gene Ammons is Jewish.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.400
Ray Charles is very Jewish.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.440
(audience laughs)

30:44.480 --> 30:45.780
Al Jolson is goyish.

30:45.820 --> 30:46.860
(audience laughs)

30:46.900 --> 30:48.360
The Army is goyish.

30:48.410 --> 30:49.610
The Navy is goyish.

30:49.660 --> 30:51.240
The Marine Corps is goyish.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.870
The Air Force is Jewish.

30:52.910 --> 30:54.200
(audience laughs)

30:54.240 --> 30:56.080
Kool-Aid, goyish.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.830
Instant potatoes, scary goyish.

30:58.870 --> 31:01.790
- (laughs) -There was a thing
in Life magazine,

31:01.840 --> 31:03.460
there was a picture of this cat.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.800
See, he's up in the mountains,
a r-rope around him,

31:05.840 --> 31:07.970
in this ad for Camel cigarettes.

31:08.010 --> 31:09.590
And it's-it's, uh...

31:09.630 --> 31:12.800
This is... dig, his name
is so goyish, it's beautiful.

31:12.850 --> 31:14.180
(audience laughs)

31:14.220 --> 31:16.350
Bob B-Y-H-R-E.

31:16.390 --> 31:20.850
Try to say it.
Bob B-Y-H-R-E.

31:20.900 --> 31:22.110
Bob Buh?

31:22.150 --> 31:24.610
- (laughs) -It's so goyish,
you can't even say it.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.940
- (audience laughs)
- Bob Burrre.

31:27.990 --> 31:30.860
Now, dig, Bob, it said,
"Bob Bhyre,

31:30.910 --> 31:33.950
who goes up to the mountains
to save people for nothing."

31:33.990 --> 31:36.410
He risks his life
to save people for nothing.

31:36.450 --> 31:37.700
What Jew would do that?

31:37.750 --> 31:38.870
(laughing)

31:38.910 --> 31:41.330
Bob Byhre does it.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.800
Now, dig it, uh,
these cats behind me,

31:45.840 --> 31:47.130
they're just cool.

31:47.170 --> 31:48.526
Uh, they just got back
from Chicago,

31:48.550 --> 31:50.090
opening for Mingus.

31:50.130 --> 31:51.946
In fact, I heard he was thinking
about packing it in

31:51.970 --> 31:53.720
after hearing them.
Isn't that right, guys?

31:53.760 --> 31:55.350
So, give them
a round of applause

31:55.390 --> 31:56.786
and don't fake it
like you did for me

31:56.810 --> 31:58.220
or like your wives do for you.

31:58.270 --> 31:59.890
(audience laughs)

31:59.930 --> 32:02.060
Lindsey Trent and the Hot Three.

32:02.100 --> 32:05.230
(band plays)

32:09.360 --> 32:10.820
You actually made it.

32:10.860 --> 32:12.200
I actually did.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.990
It's my first jazz club.

32:14.030 --> 32:15.780
- Oh, mine, too.
- (chuckles)

32:25.960 --> 32:27.976
Pounder comes up, saying
I was all drunk and belligerent.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.316
- (Midge laughs)
- Well, were you?

32:29.340 --> 32:30.630
I wasn't drunk. I was stoned.

32:30.670 --> 32:32.130
(all laugh)

32:32.180 --> 32:33.446
And we had finished playing
for the night.

32:33.470 --> 32:34.776
LINDSEY:
What's that have to do with it?

32:34.800 --> 32:35.986
I wasn't belligerent
during the set.

32:36.010 --> 32:37.406
Nah, you were just missing notes
during the set.

32:37.430 --> 32:38.890
LENNY:
Yeah, but it's jazz.

32:38.930 --> 32:41.020
Who can tell when
you're missing the notes?

32:41.060 --> 32:43.076
You know, in St. Louis,
they pulled me in for spitting.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.440
- What?
- Spitting, yeah.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.916
Spitting while black
is more like it.

32:45.940 --> 32:47.520
Hell, yeah.

32:47.570 --> 32:49.780
- I've been hooked seven times.
- Seven? What?

32:49.820 --> 32:53.360
For talking in front of people
who paid to see me talk.

32:53.410 --> 32:54.780
- Hmm.
- Seven arrests.

32:54.820 --> 32:55.870
Shit, you got me beat.

32:55.910 --> 32:56.950
Yeah, I only got the one.

32:56.990 --> 32:58.280
Two for me.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.120
We're talking
about getting arrested.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.460
Yeah.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.500
For jaywalking or something?

33:06.540 --> 33:08.460
Profanity. Indecent exposure.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.880
LINDSEY:
Shit.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.050
Well, much respect, Duchess.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.680
Is this a marijuana joint?

33:13.720 --> 33:15.680
- Oh, that smell.
- Get ready, man, get ready.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.970
My college roommate's sock
drawer smelled like this.

33:18.010 --> 33:20.640
I thought it was some
Eastern European potpourri.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.020
I hold it in, right?

33:22.060 --> 33:24.480
- If you can.
- MAN: No, no, man.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.690
This can't be the little man.

33:25.730 --> 33:27.310
Yeah, six months and counting.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.416
What, what? He looks like
he can already hold drumsticks.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.860
- He can hold drumsticks.
- (laughs)

33:30.900 --> 33:32.570
He can hold a radial tire.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.110
He's strong, this kid.

33:34.150 --> 33:35.280
No cough.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.410
Was I supposed to cough?

33:36.450 --> 33:37.530
Not if you can help it.

33:37.570 --> 33:38.740
Excellent.

33:38.780 --> 33:39.910
How do you feel?

33:39.950 --> 33:41.290
How do I feel?
How do I feel?

33:41.330 --> 33:43.120
I'm trying to figure out
how I feel.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.660
I feel fine. I feel good.

33:44.710 --> 33:46.620
So, what do we do?
Do we do an activity?

33:46.670 --> 33:49.040
- Take another hit.
- (laughter)

33:49.090 --> 33:51.130
(coughing):
Oh, so cute.

33:51.170 --> 33:52.260
Shoot, I coughed.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.470
- I noticed.
- (coughs)

33:53.510 --> 33:54.720
Is this your baby?

33:54.760 --> 33:57.090
- He thinks it is.
- Shut up, man.

33:57.140 --> 33:58.890
- (laughter)
- Oh, so cute.

33:58.930 --> 34:00.350
LINDSEY:
You got any of your own?

34:00.390 --> 34:02.560
- A boy and a girl.
- Yeah, let's see a picture.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.020
- Oh.
- LINDSEY: This one, man,

34:05.060 --> 34:06.770
it's all my wife's doing.

34:06.810 --> 34:08.350
I come home every night.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.270
It's still breathing.
It's a little bit bigger.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.650
You know, she does it all
and I just roll thunder.

34:12.690 --> 34:13.940
She is amazing.

34:13.989 --> 34:15.045
- (door opens)
- MAN 2: Hey, guys.

34:15.070 --> 34:16.780
- You're back up.
- Damn.

34:16.820 --> 34:19.030
- Lenny, go introduce us.
- Oh, come on.

34:19.070 --> 34:21.580
You can't ask me after I've
taken five hits off a joint.

34:21.620 --> 34:23.120
I can't remember my name.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.040
I'll introduce you.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.750
An activity. Yes.

34:26.790 --> 34:29.380
Here, hold this.

34:29.420 --> 34:31.060
Where the hell does
she think she's going?

34:31.090 --> 34:32.300
I have no idea.

34:32.340 --> 34:34.510
Anyone got Sen-Sen?

34:38.090 --> 34:40.025
- Hi, everybody. -MAN: Hi.
- (microphone feedback)

34:40.050 --> 34:41.600
Are you ready
for some more music?

34:41.639 --> 34:43.100
(audience cheers and whoops)

34:43.139 --> 34:45.179
MIDGE:
Nice.

34:45.230 --> 34:48.440
So, first time at a jazz club,
raise your hand.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.770
Just me?

34:49.810 --> 34:51.520
Wow. Only virgin.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.150
(audience chuckles)

34:53.190 --> 34:55.045
Losing my virginity
to a bunch of jazz musicians,

34:55.070 --> 34:57.110
every Jewish mother's
worst nightmare.

34:57.150 --> 34:59.780
- (audience laughs) -Anyway, I
was outside talking to the guys,

34:59.820 --> 35:02.200
and Lindsey here
whips out his...

35:02.240 --> 35:03.910
- (audience chuckles)
- ...wallet.

35:03.950 --> 35:06.200
What did you think
I was gonna say? His penis?

35:06.250 --> 35:08.080
No. That was already out.

35:08.120 --> 35:12.460
So, he pulled out a picture
of his really cute baby,

35:12.500 --> 35:14.566
very adorable, and then somebody
asked me if I had kids,

35:14.590 --> 35:16.356
and I said yes,
and they asked to see a picture,

35:16.380 --> 35:19.550
and I realized...
I don't have one.

35:19.590 --> 35:22.260
I've got two kids. No picture.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.350
I've got everything else
in the world in my purse.

35:24.390 --> 35:27.270
I've got a... look,
a-a Diners Club card,

35:27.310 --> 35:29.140
a compact;

35:29.190 --> 35:31.730
one, two, three lipsticks...
three.

35:31.770 --> 35:33.190
Two lips, three lipsticks.

35:33.230 --> 35:35.820
- (audience laughs)
- Nail polish,

35:35.860 --> 35:38.530
cigarettes, a corn pad,
and a Kotex sanitary belt.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.990
It comes in white now, ladies,
so rush right out.

35:41.030 --> 35:43.120
- (audience laughs)
- I mean,

35:43.160 --> 35:45.410
if my kids got kidnapped
and I had to describe them,

35:45.450 --> 35:47.250
I'd have to say,
"They look like kids.

35:47.290 --> 35:49.750
"I-I don't know.
The whosit's got a head.

35:49.790 --> 35:52.380
The other one's got a... head."

35:54.590 --> 35:57.380
- Anyone know this fucker?
- (woman gasps)

35:57.420 --> 35:59.220
- Dr. Spock.
- (audience applauds)

35:59.260 --> 36:01.010
I had never read this,

36:01.050 --> 36:02.906
not until my son started doing
this really weird thing

36:02.930 --> 36:06.140
where I wake up and he's staring
at me like he's planning things.

36:06.180 --> 36:08.770
And-and I'm thinking,
"Well, right now he's small.

36:08.810 --> 36:10.690
I can take him,
but in a few years..."

36:10.730 --> 36:12.310
(audience laughs)

36:12.350 --> 36:13.980
So, I turned to the expert.

36:14.020 --> 36:17.190
And one of the things
he says is, "Trust yourself."

36:17.230 --> 36:19.150
You know more
than you think you do."

36:19.190 --> 36:21.150
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:21.200 --> 36:23.450
- (laughs)
- That's his sage advice?

36:23.490 --> 36:24.910
"You got this"?

36:24.950 --> 36:26.740
Trust me, I don't got this.

36:26.780 --> 36:29.120
And now, now I'm thinking,
"A," I could have used the money

36:29.160 --> 36:31.160
I spent on this stupid book
on a fourth lipstick,

36:31.210 --> 36:35.630
and "B," what if I wasn't
supposed to be a mother?

36:35.670 --> 36:38.210
What if I picked
the wrong profession?

36:38.250 --> 36:40.380
If you're afraid of blood,
you don't become a surgeon.

36:40.420 --> 36:42.680
If you don't like to fly,
you don't join Pan Am.

36:42.720 --> 36:46.600
I-I can't change my mind and
donate my kids to the library,

36:46.640 --> 36:48.060
like I'm gonna do
with this book.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.770
- (book thuds)
- (audience laughs)

36:49.810 --> 36:51.350
Oh, my God, I'm awful.

36:51.390 --> 36:53.650
I mean, women are supposed
to be mothers.

36:53.690 --> 36:55.900
It's supposed to be natural.

36:55.940 --> 36:58.190
It comes with the tits, right?

36:58.230 --> 37:00.440
The equipment is pre-installed.

37:00.490 --> 37:02.820
I mean, are there exceptions?

37:02.860 --> 37:06.320
What if some of us are just
supposed to travel a lot?

37:06.370 --> 37:10.370
Or run 24-hour diners out in
rural areas wearing coveralls?

37:10.410 --> 37:11.700
What if some of us are supposed

37:11.750 --> 37:14.670
to just talk to adults
our entire life?

37:14.710 --> 37:16.266
Oh, I never thought about
any of this before tonight.

37:16.290 --> 37:17.630
Ethan's gonna know.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.106
He's gonna look at my face
when I get home

37:19.130 --> 37:20.396
and figure out he has to
accelerate the plan.

37:20.420 --> 37:21.590
- Fuck.
- (audience laughs)

37:21.630 --> 37:23.840
I thought this was supposed
to be a fun evening,

37:23.880 --> 37:26.010
filled with music
and smoking pot

37:26.050 --> 37:27.850
with a bunch of strange men
in an alley,

37:27.890 --> 37:30.770
and instead I'm filled
with dread and doubts

37:30.810 --> 37:32.640
and I am starving.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.360
Why am I starving?
Do they serve food here?

37:34.390 --> 37:36.496
Is Lenny Bruce boring at home?
Like, at home is he all,

37:36.520 --> 37:37.916
(deadpan):
"Have you seen my red socks?"

37:37.940 --> 37:39.496
And then he comes on stage
and he's all,

37:39.520 --> 37:40.836
(imitating George Macready):
"I'm gonna put a little

37:40.860 --> 37:43.070
airplane glue on a rag
and fuck, shit, cock, prick."

37:43.110 --> 37:45.070
And are those pretzels?

37:45.110 --> 37:46.610
(audience applauds and chuckles)

37:49.830 --> 37:53.660
Mmm. Delicious.

37:53.710 --> 37:55.000
What?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.250
You got to introduce the band.

37:56.290 --> 37:57.500
Oh, shit.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.880
Lindsey Trent and the Hot Three.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.020
♪ ♪

38:27.700 --> 38:29.160
Excuse me, ma'am.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.280
Yes?

38:30.320 --> 38:32.290
Guests have to sign in.

38:32.330 --> 38:35.540
Then I will do that.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.750
And your name is?

38:36.790 --> 38:38.540
Chuckle Frankenburg.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.100
Are you sure
you're in the right place?

38:40.130 --> 38:42.050
- The Friars Club?
- I don't know. Am I?

38:42.090 --> 38:43.106
- I don't know.
- Third base.

38:43.130 --> 38:44.420
This was fun.

38:44.460 --> 38:46.880
Ma'am, please don't walk
away from me.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.970
- Ma'am. (clears throat)
- May I help you?

38:49.010 --> 38:50.970
Ah, yes.
I am here to have dinner.

38:51.010 --> 38:52.100
I don't think so.

38:52.140 --> 38:54.100
- Sorry, Kenneth.
- Oh, Kenneth.

38:54.140 --> 38:56.390
He was talking some serious shit
about you earlier.

38:56.430 --> 38:59.020
(clucks tongue)
Naughty boy. Carry on.

38:59.060 --> 39:00.980
KENNETH:
Ma'am?

39:01.020 --> 39:03.020
Ma'am, ma'am.

39:03.070 --> 39:05.690
This club is for members only.

39:05.740 --> 39:08.280
It's a hangout for comics,
not the U.N.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.820
Just loosen up, guys.

39:09.860 --> 39:12.280
- You can't stay here.
- Then kick me out.

39:12.330 --> 39:14.040
No takers?

39:14.080 --> 39:15.926
Why don't you get Milton Berle
to swing his dick around,

39:15.950 --> 39:17.210
knock me out into the street.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.170
- That'll do the trick.
- Hold on, guys.

39:19.210 --> 39:20.226
CONCIERGE:
I'm sorry, Mr. Drake.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.250
We'll take care of this.

39:21.290 --> 39:22.420
No, I'll take care of this.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.800
- Hello, Susie.
- Harry.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.460
You're a giant pain in the ass.

39:25.510 --> 39:26.880
Your ear hair is turning gray.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.510
I'll take it from here, guys.

39:28.550 --> 39:30.340
If she touched you, wash.

39:30.380 --> 39:33.100
Ha-ha. We still on
for lawn bowling Sunday, yeah?

39:33.140 --> 39:35.600
Come on.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.430
HARRY:
Two Scotches, please.

39:40.310 --> 39:43.400
Wow, George Jessel looks like
he fell in a vat of fries.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.230
Did I miss your call?

39:45.270 --> 39:47.940
- I didn't call.
- Couldn't scrape up a nickel?

39:47.990 --> 39:49.900
Didn't want to deal with
your idiot secretary.

39:49.950 --> 39:52.070
I hate her.
I hate all secretaries.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.910
They're worthless.
What's the name of yours?

39:53.950 --> 39:55.620
- Sandra.
- Mm.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.450
Yeah, she's half moron,
half boobs.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.040
And 100% my wife.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.870
Really?
Since when?

40:01.920 --> 40:04.750
A few months ago. I'm sorry you
weren't invited to the wedding.

40:04.790 --> 40:06.170
Mm, I'll go to the next one.

40:06.210 --> 40:07.840
So I sent this kid
down to the Gaslight,

40:07.880 --> 40:09.170
he's working up a set.

40:09.220 --> 40:12.300
Fellow named Langford.
You catch him?

40:12.340 --> 40:14.600
I caught the whiff.
I can still smell it.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.390
No good, huh?

40:16.430 --> 40:19.350
Well, he helped tune the piano,
so it wasn't a complete loss.

40:19.390 --> 40:22.900
Susie, um, don't take this
the wrong way,

40:22.940 --> 40:26.110
but, uh, what the hell
are you doing here?

40:26.150 --> 40:31.070
Well, I'm thinking about getting
into management, like you.

40:31.110 --> 40:33.070
- Well, there's no one like me.
- I know.

40:33.110 --> 40:34.630
I mean, you discovered
a lot of people.

40:34.660 --> 40:36.030
Good people, funny people.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.216
I mean, you put Jerry and Dean
together, for Christ's sake.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.306
You're the only one I can stand
in this stupid business.

40:40.330 --> 40:41.910
I love you, too.

40:41.960 --> 40:45.210
I found somebody,
and she is impulsive

40:45.250 --> 40:48.630
and intuitive and hysterical,
and I think she's gonna be big.

40:48.670 --> 40:49.670
She sing?

40:49.710 --> 40:51.420
No, Harry, she's a comic.

40:51.470 --> 40:52.680
Okay, okay.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.140
Female comics are a tough sell.

40:54.180 --> 40:55.140
What's her name?

40:55.180 --> 40:56.140
I'm not gonna tell you.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.510
Then you're gonna go after her,

40:57.560 --> 40:59.286
and I'll be stuck
with your brother's nephew's

40:59.310 --> 41:00.996
son's camp counselor
you sent to me last year.

41:01.020 --> 41:04.150
All right, all right.
She'll remain nameless.

41:04.190 --> 41:06.940
She's special.
I mean, raw, unpredictable.

41:06.980 --> 41:09.730
And we are going forward
in a big, aggressive way.

41:09.780 --> 41:11.860
- Well, that sounds great.
- It is.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.200
- I just, I got one question.
- Shoot.

41:14.240 --> 41:17.200
What the hell do I do?

41:17.240 --> 41:18.280
(chuckles)

41:18.330 --> 41:21.250
One question, huh?

41:21.290 --> 41:24.250
Okay, lesson one,

41:24.290 --> 41:25.790
learn how to deal
with secretaries.

41:25.830 --> 41:29.840
Call and set up a lunch.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.220
It's a much longer
conversation.

41:36.050 --> 41:39.680
- No, the guy's name is Tanner,
- MAN: Taxi!

41:39.720 --> 41:41.406
- and it's on Lenox.
- Right, the guy's Lanner,

41:41.430 --> 41:43.560
- and it's on Tennox, I got it.
- You got shit.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.286
- You're going with me.
- Fine, I'll go with you.

41:45.310 --> 41:46.980
Just be gentle.

41:47.020 --> 41:50.520
Hey, we're going up
to an after-hours in Harlem.

41:50.570 --> 41:51.780
Do you want to tag along?

41:51.820 --> 41:53.086
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna
head home.

41:53.110 --> 41:54.650
Okay.

41:54.700 --> 41:56.860
I did pretty good
for my first night of freedom.

41:56.910 --> 41:59.280
- Freedom?
- Yeah.

41:59.330 --> 42:01.540
My husband left me.

42:01.580 --> 42:04.710
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.420
It's, uh...

42:08.000 --> 42:11.420
Uh-oh, you need me to be
understanding or something?

42:11.460 --> 42:13.420
I can pretend to do that.

42:13.460 --> 42:15.510
It is what it is.

42:15.550 --> 42:19.180
Here, take this one.
We'll grab another.

42:19.220 --> 42:20.850
Thanks.

42:22.890 --> 42:24.650
- LINDSEY: Night, Midge.
- MAN: Night, Midge.

42:29.860 --> 42:31.820
For later.

42:36.110 --> 42:38.700
- Riverside and 113th.
- DRIVER: Sure.

42:38.740 --> 42:40.240
See ya, Midge.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.160
Bye, Lenny.

42:44.370 --> 42:47.670
Wait, was I supposed to
make a pass at you?

42:53.210 --> 42:57.340
Dad, you know I look up to you,
and I respect you.

42:57.380 --> 42:59.800
And I know that you've
always thought

42:59.840 --> 43:02.350
that I'd follow you
into the business here.

43:02.390 --> 43:06.600
But I'm not you. I'm me.

43:06.640 --> 43:10.020
Now, you and Mom
sacrificed a lot,

43:10.060 --> 43:12.190
and you've given me
every opportunity,

43:12.230 --> 43:15.070
but, Dad, I want to make it
somewhere on my own.

43:15.110 --> 43:16.650
Like you did.

43:16.690 --> 43:18.716
Y-You came to New York
without a nickel in your pocket,

43:18.740 --> 43:21.700
and you built something,
you forged your own path.

43:21.740 --> 43:24.910
So let me forge mine.

43:24.950 --> 43:27.790
Well, that's a very
sound argument, son.

43:27.830 --> 43:29.540
You're a brilliant man...
I have faith

43:29.580 --> 43:31.170
that you know what you're doing,

43:31.210 --> 43:34.000
and you can achieve anything
you set your mind to.

43:34.050 --> 43:35.800
Now, take off your clothes.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.880
Okay, see, I don't think
my father's gonna say that.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.130
He might.

43:39.180 --> 43:40.276
You're not taking this
seriously.

43:40.300 --> 43:41.550
- I am.
- You're not.

43:41.590 --> 43:43.260
Okay, I'm gonna think
of serious things

43:43.300 --> 43:45.350
to get myself in a serious
frame of mind.

43:45.390 --> 43:48.520
Uh... the atom bomb.
Septic shock.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.190
- Midge...
- Indochina, whatever that is.

43:50.230 --> 43:53.400
Midge...

43:53.440 --> 43:55.820
do you really think
this is a good idea?

43:55.860 --> 43:58.900
It's a very sound argument.

43:58.940 --> 44:00.780
I think you're
a brilliant man,

44:00.820 --> 44:02.426
and I have faith that
you know what you're doing,

44:02.450 --> 44:05.450
and you can achieve anything
you set your mind to.

44:05.490 --> 44:06.620

44:46.280 --> 44:48.330
You been downtown?

44:48.370 --> 44:51.290
Uh, no. Laundry day.

44:51.330 --> 44:53.250
What are you doing here?

44:53.290 --> 44:55.960
Midge...

44:56.000 --> 44:58.750
I've been thinking a lot
about our situation...

44:58.800 --> 45:00.460
where we are.

45:00.510 --> 45:02.470
I'm on a couch.

45:02.510 --> 45:05.220
And you, I mean, I don't know
what happened today.

45:05.260 --> 45:06.776
I don't know what
you needed the money for,

45:06.800 --> 45:08.180
and I don't care.

45:08.220 --> 45:10.140
I promised I wouldn't ask.

45:10.180 --> 45:12.480
But clearly, things aren't
going great

45:12.520 --> 45:14.650

45:14.690 --> 45:17.650
Maybe this was a mistake.

45:17.690 --> 45:20.690
So...

45:20.730 --> 45:23.280
I'm thinking of giving it
another go.

45:26.660 --> 45:28.660
(door creaks)

45:36.500 --> 45:38.630
Papa?

45:40.000 --> 45:41.420
What are you doing down here?

45:41.460 --> 45:45.380
Well, I brought Ethan down
a few hours ago.

45:45.430 --> 45:47.260
He likes his bed,

45:47.300 --> 45:50.350
and he was staring at Rose
in a very weird way.

45:50.390 --> 45:52.770
Sure, yeah.

45:52.810 --> 45:55.230
Are you okay?

45:56.230 --> 45:57.810
Joel was downstairs.

45:57.860 --> 45:59.320
Here?

46:01.320 --> 46:03.190
What did he want?

46:03.240 --> 46:05.780
He wanted to give it another go.

46:05.820 --> 46:06.990
Really?

46:08.570 --> 46:11.790
Well...

46:11.830 --> 46:14.750

46:14.790 --> 46:16.960
No.

46:20.460 --> 46:22.340
No?

46:24.130 --> 46:25.720
Why?

46:25.760 --> 46:28.760
