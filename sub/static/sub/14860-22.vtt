The food truck business
is about to boom,

00:09.468 --> 00:11.675

to contend with my archenemy,

the Brazilian.

00:15.307 --> 00:16.341
What's wrong
with you guys?

00:16.642 --> 00:17.723
Normally, you'd
razz me pretty hard

00:18.018 --> 00:18.928
when I say things like
"Spring has sprung.”

00:19.228 --> 00:20.434
Or when I walk into
a room.

Oh, I love that guy. He has
the best churrascherascia.

It's... (IMITATES BRAZILIAN

00:45.796 --> 00:46.831
Ugh.
Gross.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.541
Anyway,
the guy's a real jerk.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.922
He's always sabotaging me,
trying to steal my business.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.834
Just fight back
like you did in high school

00:53.136 --> 00:54.251
when those kids stole
your can of mousse.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.137
Oh, wait.
You didn't fight back.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.512
You just hid
in the yearbook office

00:57.808 --> 00:59.139
and complained that
your hair wasn't hard enough.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.890
Penny,
this dude is hard-core.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.551
One time, he plugged an
exhaust vent in my truck

01:02.854 --> 01:04.218
with human manure.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.685
And he's always calling in
fake to-go orders.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.474
You didn't think it was weird
that Dean Cain asked you

01:08.777 --> 01:10.734
to cater an 1,100
person bachelor party?

01:11.029 --> 01:12.144
No, Jane, | didn't
think it was weird

because it was
Dean freakin' Cain.

Brad, maybe you more
towards the front,

some Raiders gear?

01:25.294 --> 01:27.831
Well, us gals can't help

Yep. I'm officially

01:33.927 --> 01:35.042

even thought about that.

was gonna walk you down the aisle?

(GASPS)

02:51.922 --> 02:53.833

02:54.132 --> 02:55.213
What?
(WHISPERS) Yes!

02:55.509 --> 02:58.092
Why? I can't even remember
the last time I saw him.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.343
Yeah, 'cause
he's a deadbeat.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.174
He left you and your mom
to become an actor?

03:01.473 --> 03:03.635
Ugh.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.595
Awful.

But, Jane, "deadbeat”
is a little strong.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.096
Roy and my mom
were 17.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.481
They were just two kids
doing Shakespeare in the park

03:12.776 --> 03:14.107
and each other
in the parking lot.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.019
Besides, my mom and |
were fine without him.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.937
But this is a chance
to reconnect with him.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.730
No, Pen, I don't wanna
see you get hurt.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.990
Okay, he was
never there for you.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.650
Why would you let him be
a part of your special day?

have half your dad's D.N.A_,

03:29.126 --> 03:30.616
Think of how great
he could be.

03:30.919 --> 03:31.579
He's the great unknown.

We've been to the moon.

Really, Jane? Have we?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.461
Or have we been to
a sound stage in Burbank?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.296
Penny, you got to
at least call him

03:40.595 --> 03:41.460
and tell him that
you're getting married.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.967
Yeah. Maybe I will.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.895
Well... (SIGHS)

basic business principles...

Marketing, quality,
research, and service.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.690

soccer tournament,

bet against the team,
and then threw the game.

minus the $10 it cost me

enough to strap down my girls.

change the order from

and I went with peonies.

and order?

ligament, and inner ear meat.

All right. And there's so such
thing as a prime colon chop, pal.

It's 1981, '82,
something like that,

07:01.922 --> 07:04.380
and Stephen Sondheim looks
at me... (UTENSIL CLATTERS)

"You've got it."

07:10.764 --> 07:12.971
Of course, then I realized he
was talking about his umbrella.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.552
'Cause we were
by the front door,

07:14.851 --> 07:16.057
and I thought there
was, like, a communal

"give an umbrella,
take an umbrella" thing.

that was...

in the '80s.

I've got no excuse, okay?

07:29.532 --> 07:30.943
I'm so sorry.

feel better,

work out either.

make me feel better.

You betrayed me!
You stole Dave's idea!

18:38.326 --> 18:40.192
I'm sorry! My father
invoked "dads before lads!"

19:48.396 --> 19:50.307
And then I thought | found
a way | could fix things,

19:50.606 --> 19:53.439

too fast, is all.

give you this.
