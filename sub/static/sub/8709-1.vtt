00:30.656 --> 00:33.219
<i>It's an important and popular fact</i>

00:33.447 --> 00:37.199
<i>that things are not always</i>
<i>what they seem.</i>

00:37.535 --> 00:41.203
<i>For instance, on the planet Earth,</i>
<i>man had always assumed</i>

00:41.340 --> 00:45.042
<i>that he was the most intelligent</i>
<i>species occupying the planet,</i>

00:45.142 --> 00:47.563
<i>instead of the third most intelligent.</i>

00:47.861 --> 00:52.508
<i>The second most intelligent creatures</i>
<i>were dolphins, who, curiously enough,</i>

00:52.612 --> 00:56.143
<i>had long known of the impending</i>
<i>destruction of the planet Earth.</i>

00:56.534 --> 00:58.751
<i>They'd made many attempts</i>
<i>to alert mankind,</i>

00:58.934 --> 01:01.908
<i>but most of their communications</i>
<i>were misinterpreted</i>

01:02.022 --> 01:05.546
<i>as amusing attempts to punch footballs</i>
<i>or whistle for titbits.</i>

01:05.683 --> 01:09.984
<i>So they eventually decided they would</i>
<i>leave Earth by their own means.</i>

01:10.121 --> 01:13.256
<i>The last ever dolphin message</i>
<i>was misinterpreted</i>

01:13.370 --> 01:16.794
<i>as a sophisticated attempt</i>
<i>to do a backward somersault</i>

01:16.922 --> 01:19.913
<i>through a hoop,</i>
<i>whistling</i> The Star-Spangled Banner.

01:20.050 --> 01:21.758
<i>In fact, the message was this:</i>

01:21.885 --> 01:24.756
<i>"So long and thanks for all the fish."</i>

01:51.415 --> 01:53.446
<i>So long and thanks for all the fish</i>

01:53.550 --> 01:55.581
<i>So sad that it should come to this</i>

01:55.711 --> 01:59.791
<i>We tried to warn you all but, oh, dear</i>

01:59.923 --> 02:01.954
<i>You may not share our intellect</i>

02:02.059 --> 02:04.081
<i>Which might explain your disrespect</i>

02:04.186 --> 02:08.294
<i>For all the natural wonders</i>
<i>that grow around you</i>

02:08.399 --> 02:12.684
<i>So long, so long and thanks</i>
<i>for all the fish</i>

02:14.896 --> 02:16.761
<i>Your world's about to be destroyed</i>

02:16.865 --> 02:18.971
<i>There's no point getting all annoyed</i>

02:19.076 --> 02:23.557
<i>Lie back and let the planet</i>
<i>dissolve around you</i>

02:23.661 --> 02:25.520
<i>Despite those nets of tuna fleets</i>

02:25.624 --> 02:27.602
<i>We thought that most of you were sweet</i>

02:27.706 --> 02:31.774
<i>Especially tiny tots</i>
<i>and your pregnant women</i>

02:31.878 --> 02:34.078
<i>So long, so long,</i>
<i>so long, so long, so long</i>

02:36.084 --> 02:40.378
<i>So long, so long</i>
<i>and thanks for all the fish</i>

02:42.716 --> 02:46.956
<i>If I had just one last wish</i>

02:47.060 --> 02:51.088
<i>I would like a tasty fish</i>

02:51.192 --> 02:55.467
<i>If we could just change one thing</i>

02:55.572 --> 02:59.774
<i>We would all have lungs to sing</i>

02:59.900 --> 03:04.418
<i>Come one and all</i>

03:04.518 --> 03:08.510
<i>Man and mammal</i>

03:08.610 --> 03:12.140
<i>Side by side</i>

03:12.240 --> 03:18.495
<i>In life's great gene pool</i>

03:36.812 --> 03:38.970
<i>So long, so long,</i>
<i>so long, so long, so long</i>

03:41.024 --> 03:47.228
<i>So long, so long</i>
<i>and thanks for all the fish</i>

04:00.711 --> 04:05.079
<i>The extraordinary story</i>
<i>of</i> The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

04:05.183 --> 04:06.827
<i>begins very simply.</i>

04:06.931 --> 04:09.796
<i>It begins with a man.</i>

04:18.853 --> 04:22.511
<i>An Earthman, to be precise,</i>
<i>who no more knows his destiny,</i>

04:22.615 --> 04:26.059
<i>than a tea leaf knows the history</i>
<i>of the East India Company.</i>

04:28.405 --> 04:31.185
<i>His name is Arthur Dent.</i>

04:31.289 --> 04:34.562
<i>He is a five-foot-eight-inch-tall</i>
<i>ape descendant,</i>

04:34.666 --> 04:38.659
<i>and someone is trying to drive</i>
<i>a bypass through his house.</i>

04:43.962 --> 04:45.949
What do I want you to do about it?

04:46.053 --> 04:50.204
Find him and tell him I'm currently
lying flat on my back in front of...

04:50.308 --> 04:51.578
Fine, I'll hold.

04:51.682 --> 04:54.337
You can't lie in front
of the bulldozers for ever.

04:54.441 --> 04:56.584
I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

04:56.688 --> 05:00.007
This bypass has got to be built
and it is going to be built.

05:00.112 --> 05:04.101
- Why has it got to be built?
- It's a bypass.

05:04.232 --> 05:08.766
You've got to build bypasses. Besides,
you should've protested months ago.

05:08.870 --> 05:12.186
The plans have been on display
at the planning office for a year.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.952
On display?
I had to go down to a cellar.

05:15.077 --> 05:20.405
Mr Dent, have you any idea how much
damage this bulldozer would suffer

05:20.509 --> 05:22.954
if I just let it roll straight over you?

05:24.169 --> 05:27.116
- How much?
- None at all.

05:27.220 --> 05:30.038
<i>By a strange coincidence,</i>
<i>"none at all"</i>

05:30.143 --> 05:33.829
<i>is exactly how much suspicion</i>
<i>ape-descendant Arthur Dent had</i>

05:33.933 --> 05:35.915
<i>that one of his closest friends</i>

05:36.019 --> 05:39.671
<i>was not descended from an ape,</i>
<i>but was, in fact, from a small planet</i>

05:39.775 --> 05:42.888
<i>somewhere in the vicinity</i>
<i>of Betelgeuse.</i>

05:43.689 --> 05:45.089
Arthur.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.012
- Ford.
- Yes?

05:48.116 --> 05:49.116
Here.

05:49.701 --> 05:51.016
There you are.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.933
Eat, drink. We gotta talk.

05:53.038 --> 05:56.281
Now's not the best time.
They're going to demolish my home.

05:57.828 --> 06:00.774
You already know? How?

06:00.879 --> 06:02.782
What do you...?

06:04.543 --> 06:07.618
Oh, they, they? When you say
"they" you mean they? Got it.

06:07.722 --> 06:12.368
Listen. I got somethin' important
I gotta tell you. Right now.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.958
Well, what about my house?

06:19.474 --> 06:24.979
Workers of the Earth, I bring
good tidings of peanuts and beer.

06:35.532 --> 06:37.353
Good. Let's go to the pub.

06:37.457 --> 06:40.442
They won't demolish it
until they've finished the beers.

06:40.547 --> 06:42.909
- Can we trust 'em?
- To the end of the Earth.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.412
- How far's that?
- About 12 minutes away.

06:46.627 --> 06:50.572
Barman, six pints of bitter and quickly.
The world's about to end.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.575
Six pints coming up.

06:52.679 --> 06:56.339
Keep the change.
You got about ten minutes to spend it.

06:56.470 --> 06:59.803
Three pints each? At lunchtime?

07:06.897 --> 07:08.097
Sorry.

07:09.032 --> 07:11.344
Time is an illusion.

07:11.448 --> 07:13.596
Lunchtime, doubly so.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.519
And eat those peanuts
because you'll need the salt.

07:17.623 --> 07:20.285
- Look, what is going on, Ford?
- Arthur...

07:22.412 --> 07:25.858
What if I told you
I really wasn't from Guildford?

07:25.963 --> 07:30.370
I was from a small planet
somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?

07:30.504 --> 07:34.003
- Is it something you're likely to say?
- Remember when we met?

07:41.014 --> 07:42.212
Out of the way.

07:45.802 --> 07:46.802
Hi.

07:46.949 --> 07:49.967
Wasn't it strange I was trying
to shake hands with a car?

07:50.071 --> 07:51.597
I assumed you were drunk.

07:51.701 --> 07:55.772
I thought cars were the dominant
life form. I was introducing myself.

07:55.904 --> 08:00.272
You saved my life.
And now I'm saving yours. Please drink.

08:00.376 --> 08:03.691
It must be Thursday. I could never
get the hang of Thursdays.

08:03.795 --> 08:07.156
- If this is about your house...
- No, it's not about the house.

08:11.169 --> 08:13.284
- Who's he?
- She.

08:13.388 --> 08:16.998
Tricia McMillan.
We met at a fancy-dress party.

08:18.427 --> 08:20.413
<i>I hate those kind of parties.</i>

08:20.517 --> 08:23.504
<i>I'd rather have stayed at home</i>
<i>and ironed my hankies.</i>

08:23.608 --> 08:25.752
- <i>But there I was.</i>
- Who are you?

08:25.856 --> 08:27.588
<i>And there she was.</i>

08:27.692 --> 08:32.385
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- No. I mean, who are you?

08:32.491 --> 08:35.732
Oh, the costume? Right.
"Livingstone, I presume."

08:36.903 --> 08:41.227
Yeah, it's not as clever as Darwin,
but the best I could do at short notice.

08:41.331 --> 08:43.356
You're the first to get that right.

08:43.460 --> 08:46.232
- Really?
- Yes. Everyone calls me Santa.

08:46.336 --> 08:48.821
- Right.
- I thought the beagle was a giveaway.

08:48.957 --> 08:50.572
So did I.

08:50.677 --> 08:53.070
People at these parties
are drunken idiots.

08:53.174 --> 08:54.174
What?

08:54.639 --> 08:57.299
All these people are idiots. God.

09:01.094 --> 09:02.793
That's awkward.

09:02.897 --> 09:04.497
Tell me.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.352
She was amazing though, Ford.

09:09.478 --> 09:12.424
<i>Beautiful, witty, mad as a balloon.</i>

09:12.529 --> 09:17.149
Without the beard,
you look at least 80 years younger.

09:17.277 --> 09:20.029
Maybe I'm de-evolving.

09:22.824 --> 09:28.495
Well, I should tell you that I do not
date single-celled organisms, OK?

09:31.208 --> 09:33.406
Let's go somewhere.

09:33.510 --> 09:37.619
Yeah. Definitely.
Where do you have in mind?

09:37.724 --> 09:42.082
- Madagascar.
- Is that that new club on Dean Street?

09:42.186 --> 09:45.085
No, it's a country
off the coast of Africa.

09:45.189 --> 09:48.181
That Madagascar?
Why are we waiting here?

09:48.767 --> 09:50.967
Wait a sec.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.357
Go.

09:56.066 --> 10:00.556
God, you're serious.
I can't go to Madagascar.

10:00.660 --> 10:03.684
- Why not?
- Because, I just, you know...

10:03.788 --> 10:05.147
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

10:05.251 --> 10:08.855
I want to go somewhere I've never been
and I'd like to go with you,

10:08.959 --> 10:11.706
so what do you say, Dr Livingstone?

10:12.833 --> 10:17.617
I say that's
an extraordinary proposition.

10:17.721 --> 10:20.704
I can't go. I mean, I've got a job.

10:20.808 --> 10:23.041
Quit. Get a new one
when you come back.

10:23.176 --> 10:25.163
I don't even know your real name.

10:25.267 --> 10:28.595
- Tricia McMillan.
- Well, Tricia McMillan.

10:29.558 --> 10:32.096
I have a proposition for you.

10:32.227 --> 10:39.098
Why don't we go somewhere
a little closer first, say Cornwall,

10:39.202 --> 10:43.055
and we'll see how it goes.

10:43.159 --> 10:47.727
Right, of course, Cornwall.

10:47.831 --> 10:50.032
Hey, excuse me.

10:52.914 --> 10:57.071
Is this guy boring you?
Why don't you talk to me instead?

10:57.175 --> 11:00.039
I'm from a different planet.

11:03.133 --> 11:06.300
It's true. You want to see my spaceship?

11:07.804 --> 11:12.543
"Do you want to see my spaceship?"
What kind of chat-up line is that?

11:12.648 --> 11:14.712
That does happen.

11:14.817 --> 11:16.804
Speaking of...

11:17.898 --> 11:20.140
We've got two minutes.
Drink up.

11:20.859 --> 11:23.231
That's my house.

11:29.993 --> 11:34.027
People of Earth, a round of drinks,
for everyone, on me.

11:34.132 --> 11:36.781
You really think
the world's going to end?

11:36.886 --> 11:37.886
Yes.

11:39.002 --> 11:42.948
Shouldn't we lie down, or put a paper
bag over our heads, or something?

11:43.052 --> 11:45.956
- If you like.
- Will it help?

11:46.060 --> 11:48.748
Not at all. See you.

11:48.853 --> 11:50.090
Last orders, then.

12:06.405 --> 12:08.725
- What is that?
- Run.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.629
Look out.

12:39.146 --> 12:40.346
Towel.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.090
Arthur.

12:43.781 --> 12:45.733
What the hell are those things?

12:46.653 --> 12:49.351
They're ships
from a Vogon constructor fleet.

12:49.455 --> 12:54.020
I picked up their signal this morning.
Here, you'll need this.

12:54.124 --> 12:57.286
- What are you doing?
- We're hitching a ride.

13:00.500 --> 13:04.868
People of Earth,
this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz

13:04.973 --> 13:07.622
of the Galactic Hyperspace
Planning Council.

13:07.726 --> 13:09.248
As you are probably aware,

13:09.352 --> 13:12.956
plans for the development
of the outlying regions of the galaxy

13:13.060 --> 13:17.588
involve the building of a hyperspace
express route through your star system.

13:17.693 --> 13:21.848
And your planet is one of those
scheduled for demolition.

13:29.905 --> 13:32.391
<i>There's no point</i>
<i>acting surprised about it.</i>

13:32.495 --> 13:35.021
<i>The plans have been on display</i>

13:35.126 --> 13:38.867
<i>at your local planning office</i>
<i>in Alpha Centauri for 50 Earth years.</i>

13:39.748 --> 13:43.694
<i>If you can't be bothered</i>
<i>with local affairs, that's your lookout.</i>

13:43.798 --> 13:46.241
Apathetic bloody planet.

13:46.345 --> 13:49.339
I've no sympathy at all.

15:36.782 --> 15:39.479
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

15:39.583 --> 15:42.023
<i>is a wholly remarkable book.</i>

15:42.128 --> 15:45.361
<i>Perhaps the most remarkable,</i>
<i>certainly the most successful,</i>

15:45.465 --> 15:49.530
<i>ever to come out of the great</i>
<i>publishing corporations of Ursa Minor.</i>

15:49.634 --> 15:52.907
<i>More popular than</i>
The Celestial Homecare Omnibus,

15:53.011 --> 15:56.785
<i>better selling than</i>
53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity,

15:56.889 --> 15:59.877
<i>and more controversial than</i>
<i>Oolon Colluphid's trilogy</i>

15:59.981 --> 16:03.129
<i>of philosophical blockbusters,</i>
Where God Went Wrong,

16:03.233 --> 16:05.711
Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes,

16:05.815 --> 16:08.136
<i>and</i> Who Is This God Person Anyway?

16:08.814 --> 16:11.934
<i>It's already supplanted</i>
<i>the</i> Encyclopaedia Galactica

16:12.067 --> 16:15.181
<i>as the standard repository</i>
<i>of all knowledge and wisdom</i>

16:15.285 --> 16:17.642
<i>for two important reasons.</i>

16:17.747 --> 16:20.313
<i>First, it's slightly cheaper,</i>

16:20.450 --> 16:23.525
<i>and second, it has the words</i>
<i>"Don't Panic"</i>

16:23.630 --> 16:27.072
<i>printed in large,</i>
<i>friendly letters on its cover.</i>

16:35.757 --> 16:38.544
So you're not from Guildford?

16:38.677 --> 16:42.711
Which would explain the accent,
which I've always wondered about.

16:42.815 --> 16:46.546
You're not an out-of-work actor,

16:46.651 --> 16:52.148
but rather a writer for this,
this book thing.

16:52.941 --> 16:54.640
Good, huh?

16:54.744 --> 16:57.137
I don't feel well.
I need a cup of tea.

16:57.241 --> 17:00.645
If I asked where we were,
would I regret it?

17:00.749 --> 17:03.854
- We're safe for now.
- Good.

17:03.958 --> 17:07.902
We're in the washroom on one of the
ships of the Vogon constructor fleet.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.491
- Get me home, Ford.
- Arthur, your home is...

17:11.627 --> 17:16.170
Oh, God, my home.
My home was demolished.

17:21.053 --> 17:23.045
You don't remember.

17:24.013 --> 17:30.340
OK, Arthur, I've got something to tell
you. It's unfortunate, but it's true.

17:30.444 --> 17:33.604
Your home planet has been blown up.

17:42.449 --> 17:44.249
Blown up.

17:51.291 --> 17:53.361
Couldn't you have done something?

17:53.465 --> 17:57.494
I saved your life.
OK, that makes us even.

17:57.599 --> 18:00.868
It's a tough galaxy. If you want
to survive out here,

18:00.973 --> 18:05.215
you've gotta know where your towel is.

18:05.347 --> 18:07.838
OK, give me a hand over here.

18:10.310 --> 18:14.344
Careful. It's hot.
We've gotta get off this ship.

18:14.449 --> 18:16.471
Before the Vogons find us.

18:16.575 --> 18:19.603
Vogons, they hate hitchhikers. Pull.

18:25.409 --> 18:28.733
- Now we'll get a signal.
- What is a Vogon?

18:28.837 --> 18:30.702
Ask the Guide. Say "Vogons".

18:32.457 --> 18:33.857
Vogons.

18:35.335 --> 18:39.703
<i>Vogons are one of the</i>
<i>most unpleasant races in the galaxy.</i>

18:39.807 --> 18:44.083
<i>Not evil, but bad-tempered,</i>
<i>bureaucratic, officious and callous.</i>

18:44.187 --> 18:47.752
<i>They wouldn't even lift a finger</i>
<i>to save their own grandmothers</i>

18:47.856 --> 18:51.045
<i>from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast</i>
<i>of Traal without orders</i>

18:51.149 --> 18:53.590
<i>signed in triplicate,</i>
<i>sent in, sent back,</i>

18:53.694 --> 18:57.020
<i>queried, lost, found,</i>
<i>subjected to public inquiry,</i>

18:57.149 --> 19:00.511
<i>lost again and finally buried</i>
<i>in soft peat for three months</i>

19:00.616 --> 19:03.481
<i>and recycled as firelighters.</i>

19:04.781 --> 19:09.574
<i>On no account should you allow</i>
<i>a Vogon to read poetry to you.</i>

19:11.246 --> 19:15.825
They can't think or imagine.
Most can't spell. They just run things.

19:22.132 --> 19:24.118
And if we don't get a ride soon,

19:24.223 --> 19:27.625
we won't need the Guide to tell us
how unpleasant the Vogons are.

19:27.729 --> 19:30.041
They've already destroyed
a planet today.

19:30.145 --> 19:32.465
That always makes them a little...

19:38.857 --> 19:41.893
- What is that?
- Put this in your ear.

19:46.448 --> 19:50.272
<i>We have unwittingly picked up</i>
<i>a couple of hitchhikers.</i>

19:50.376 --> 19:53.073
The fish is translating for you.

19:54.039 --> 19:57.152
<i>The Babel fish</i>
<i>is small, yellow, leech-like,</i>

19:57.257 --> 20:01.574
<i>and probably the oddest thing</i>
<i>in the universe.</i>

20:01.678 --> 20:06.123
<i>It feeds on brainwave energy,</i>
<i>absorbing unconscious frequencies,</i>

20:06.227 --> 20:08.791
<i>and excreting a matrix</i>
<i>of conscious frequencies</i>

20:08.929 --> 20:11.087
<i>to the speech centres of the brain.</i>

20:11.223 --> 20:14.714
<i>The practical upshot of which is that,</i>
<i>if you stick one in your ear,</i>

20:14.818 --> 20:20.433
<i>you instantly understand</i>
<i>anything said to you in any language.</i>

20:28.532 --> 20:31.023
Resistance is useless.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.906
- All right.
- Someone's coming.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.412
Here we go. Look lively.

21:16.872 --> 21:17.872
Sir.

21:18.508 --> 21:21.250
- What?
- Hitchhikers.

22:00.666 --> 22:03.906
"O freddled gruntbuggly..."

22:04.011 --> 22:06.533
No, really, you don't have to read.

22:06.637 --> 22:09.327
We've put you through
enough trouble already.

22:09.432 --> 22:14.579
"...as plerdled gabbleblotchits
on a lurgid bee."

22:14.684 --> 22:20.018
<i>Vogon poetry is widely accepted</i>
<i>as the third worst in the universe.</i>

22:21.186 --> 22:24.427
<i>The second worst</i>
<i>is that of the Azgoths of Kria.</i>

22:24.531 --> 22:28.052
<i>During a recitation by their</i>
<i>Poet Master, Grunthos the Flatulent,</i>

22:28.157 --> 22:31.060
<i>of his poem</i>
Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty

22:31.164 --> 22:33.728
I Found in my Armpit
One Midsummer Morning,

22:33.865 --> 22:37.062
<i>four of his audience</i>
<i>died of internal haemorrhaging,</i>

22:37.167 --> 22:40.651
<i>and the President of the</i>
<i>Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council</i>

22:40.756 --> 22:43.150
<i>survived by gnawing</i>
<i>one of his own legs off.</i>

22:43.254 --> 22:48.156
"Or I will rend thee
in the gobberwarts..."

22:48.260 --> 22:51.202
"...with my blurgle..."

22:51.306 --> 22:55.706
<i>The absolute worst poetry was by</i>
<i>Paula Millstone Jennings of Sussex.</i>

22:55.810 --> 22:58.295
<i>Luckily, it was destroyed</i>
<i>when the Earth was.</i>

22:58.432 --> 23:03.032
"See if I don't." Yeah.

23:05.272 --> 23:10.639
So, Earthlings,
I present you with a choice.

23:10.743 --> 23:13.855
Either die in the vacuum of space,

23:13.989 --> 23:18.781
or tell me what you thought of my poem.

23:20.412 --> 23:24.326
Actually, I rather liked it.

23:26.501 --> 23:29.199
That's good. Run with it.

23:29.303 --> 23:31.703
Some of the words I didn't understand,

23:31.840 --> 23:35.209
but I found the imagery quite effective.

23:36.136 --> 23:37.457
Continue.

23:37.561 --> 23:41.211
Well, yes,
interesting rhythmic devices,

23:41.315 --> 23:43.755
which seemed to counterpoint

23:43.859 --> 23:46.511
the underlying metaphor
of the humanity of...

23:46.615 --> 23:49.802
- Vogonity.
- Vogonity, sorry, vogonity

23:49.906 --> 23:52.391
of the poet's soul.

23:55.948 --> 24:00.065
So what you're saying is,

24:00.169 --> 24:02.733
I write poetry because

24:02.871 --> 24:07.278
underneath this mean,
callous, heartless exterior,

24:07.382 --> 24:11.325
I just want to be loved?

24:12.589 --> 24:13.589
Yes.

24:14.725 --> 24:17.172
Yes, yeah, please.

24:22.766 --> 24:24.336
Throw them off the ship.

24:24.441 --> 24:27.152
- No.
- Ford.

24:29.481 --> 24:31.481
All right.

24:31.866 --> 24:35.393
Resistance is useless.

24:38.073 --> 24:42.569
Shut up. Get a job.
Wash your filthy hands.

24:42.703 --> 24:45.103
Don't panic.

24:45.504 --> 24:51.491
So this is it?
We're gonna die?

24:51.595 --> 24:55.199
Yeah, we're gonna die.

24:55.304 --> 24:58.207
No, what's this?

24:58.311 --> 24:59.955
What is this?

25:00.060 --> 25:04.347
What's this? This is nothing.
Yeah, we're gonna die.

25:15.027 --> 25:17.150
You're sweating.

25:25.412 --> 25:27.654
- Would you like a hug?
- No.

25:41.219 --> 25:44.794
<i>"Space," says the introduction</i>
<i>to</i> The Hitchhiker's Guide,

25:44.898 --> 25:47.337
<i>"is big. Really big."</i>

25:47.441 --> 25:52.845
<i>"You just won't believe how vastly,</i>
<i>hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is."</i>

25:52.949 --> 25:54.804
<i>And so on.</i>

25:54.908 --> 25:57.930
<i>It also says that</i>
<i>if you hold a lungful of air,</i>

25:58.034 --> 26:03.439
<i>you can survive in the total vacuum</i>
<i>of space for about 30 seconds.</i>

26:03.543 --> 26:05.692

<i>79 million, 460 thousand,</i>

26:13.877 --> 26:16.824
<i>347 to one against.</i>

26:16.928 --> 26:18.713
<i>By a staggering coincidence,</i>

26:18.840 --> 26:21.414
<i>it's also the phone number</i>
<i>of the Islington flat</i>

26:21.551 --> 26:23.749
<i>where Arthur went to a fancy dress party</i>

26:23.854 --> 26:27.179
<i>and met a very nice young woman</i>
<i>whom he totally blew it with.</i>

26:30.686 --> 26:34.720
<i>Though the planet Earth,</i>
<i>the Islington flat and telephone</i>

26:34.824 --> 26:40.431
<i>have all now been demolished,</i>
<i>Ford and Arthur were, in fact, rescued.</i>

26:40.535 --> 26:43.353
- Ford?
- Yes.

26:43.458 --> 26:47.528
- I think I'm a sofa.
- I know how you feel.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.657
So much for the laws of physics.

26:57.762 --> 26:59.581
<i>And once again, our top story.</i>

26:59.715 --> 27:03.999
<i>The sensational theft of the most</i>
<i>coveted ship in the universe,</i>

27:04.103 --> 27:05.997
<i>the starship Heart of Gold.</i>

27:06.101 --> 27:08.627
<i>Stolen at the launch ceremony</i>
<i>by none other</i>

27:08.731 --> 27:11.548
<i>than Galactic President</i>
<i>Zaphod Beeblebrox.</i>

27:11.653 --> 27:16.927
<i>In the name of people, freedom,</i>
<i>and democracy, stuff like that,</i>

27:17.031 --> 27:21.058
<i>I hereby kidnap myself</i>
<i>and I'm taking the ship with me.</i>

27:21.162 --> 27:23.952
<i>Come on.</i>

27:24.052 --> 27:25.727
<i>Beeblebrox, universally considered</i>

27:25.831 --> 27:28.771
<i>to be the dimmest star</i>
<i>in several solar systems,</i>

27:28.875 --> 27:32.526
<i>is most famous for his controversial</i>

<i>who claimed many thought they were</i>
<i>voting for the worst-dressed being</i>

27:36.672 --> 27:38.744
<i>in the universe contest.</i>

27:39.788 --> 27:40.831
Great.

27:40.935 --> 27:43.840
<i>Kavula is best remembered</i>
<i>for his slanderous</i>

27:43.967 --> 27:46.498
<i>"Don't Vote for Stupid!" campaign.</i>

27:46.602 --> 27:50.086
Put your ego aside.
Something important has happened.

27:50.190 --> 27:54.559
If there's anything more important than
my ego, I want it caught and shot now.

27:54.686 --> 27:56.340
Come on, I love it.

27:56.444 --> 27:59.474
<i>Zaphod's just this guy, you know.</i>

28:02.361 --> 28:03.403
What d'you...?

28:03.528 --> 28:07.768
- I was just watching myself.
- We have a couple of hitchhikers.

28:07.872 --> 28:10.435
Hitchhikers?
Why'd you pick up hitchhikers?

28:10.540 --> 28:12.409
I didn't. The ship did.

28:12.537 --> 28:14.735
What? Say what?

28:14.840 --> 28:19.449
When we engaged the
lmprobability Drive... The big button.

28:19.553 --> 28:21.576
- I know.
- They were picked up here.

28:21.680 --> 28:26.039
In sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. Wait.
That's where you picked me up.

28:26.144 --> 28:28.037
- On Earth.
- That's impossible.

28:28.142 --> 28:31.470
- No, just very improbable.
- Listen. I don't have time for this.

28:31.598 --> 28:35.838
We've got the police of half the galaxy
after us. We've stopped for hitchhikers.

28:35.942 --> 28:38.256
So ten out of ten for style, but

28:38.360 --> 28:40.802
minus several million
for good thinking.

28:40.906 --> 28:44.185
You're too gorgeous, baby, stop it.
You drive me crazy.

28:45.237 --> 28:47.644
Don't. I'll send Marvin.

28:48.865 --> 28:50.265
Marvin.

28:53.787 --> 28:56.705
You ought to know,
I'm feeling very depressed.

28:57.833 --> 29:01.157
Well, we have something
that should take your mind off things.

29:01.261 --> 29:05.915
It won't work.
I have an exceptionally large mind.

29:06.049 --> 29:11.969
Yeah, we know. But we need you to go
down to the number two entry bay

29:12.097 --> 29:14.922
and pick up our stowaways
and bring them up here.

29:15.026 --> 29:18.296
Just that? I won't enjoy it.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.054
Yeah, well, that's life.

29:21.158 --> 29:25.395
Life? Don't talk to me about life.

29:34.578 --> 29:37.025
- <i>Commander Kwaltz.</i>
- Yes.

29:37.129 --> 29:41.445
<i>We have located the spaceship</i>
<i>Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox.</i>

29:41.549 --> 29:45.661
- Where?
- <i>Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.</i>

29:45.765 --> 29:48.294
<i>Requesting hyperspace clearance.</i>

29:48.425 --> 29:54.291
Hold your position, captain,
until clearance is granted.

29:54.396 --> 29:58.719
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Get me Vice-President Questular.

30:02.105 --> 30:06.317
<i>Hyperspace permission granted, captain.</i>

30:06.443 --> 30:08.643
Here we go.

30:30.384 --> 30:33.081
I think that door just sighed.

30:33.185 --> 30:35.580
Ghastly, isn't it?

30:35.685 --> 30:38.083
All the doors have been programmed

30:38.187 --> 30:41.386
to have a cheerful
and sunny disposition.

30:43.563 --> 30:48.356
Anyway, come on. I've been ordered
to take you up to the bridge.

30:50.195 --> 30:52.181
Please yourselves.

30:52.286 --> 30:55.521
Here I am,
brain the size of a planet,

30:55.626 --> 30:58.155
and they ask me to take you
up to the bridge.

30:58.287 --> 31:01.733
Call that job satisfaction?
Cos I don't.

31:01.837 --> 31:07.531
You can thank the Sirius Cybernetics
Corp. For building robots with GPP.

31:07.635 --> 31:11.129
- What's G.P. P?
- Genuine People Personalities.

31:11.300 --> 31:15.677
I'm a personality prototype.
You can tell, can't you?

31:21.810 --> 31:23.210
Arthur?

31:24.271 --> 31:28.843
<i>Hey, Slim, are you wearing</i>
<i>my underwear? Cos I'm wearing yours.</i>

31:28.947 --> 31:31.729
<i>And they ain't doing the trick.</i>
<i>Come on. All right.</i>

31:34.906 --> 31:36.983
Oh, for heaven's sake.

31:37.951 --> 31:40.869
I've brought the aliens.
Don't thank me or anything.

31:43.123 --> 31:44.523
Freeze.

31:45.292 --> 31:48.783
Freeze? I'm a robot. Not a refrigerator.

31:48.887 --> 31:52.492
- I wasn't talking to you, Giggles.
- Why do I bother?

31:52.596 --> 31:54.382
- Zaphod?
- Ford.

31:54.509 --> 31:58.877
Is that you? Ford. Praxibetel Ix.

31:58.982 --> 32:00.959
What the hell are you doing here?

32:01.063 --> 32:04.474
I just stuck out my thumb and here I am.

32:04.603 --> 32:07.390
- That is so you.
- Look at you.

32:07.522 --> 32:11.890
President of the Galaxy.
I can't believe you beat Humma Kavula.

32:11.995 --> 32:13.600
You zarkin' frood.

32:13.705 --> 32:18.073
I want you to meet a friend.
Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox.

32:19.284 --> 32:24.274
President of the Galaxy. This is my
cousin. He's a semi-half brother...

32:24.378 --> 32:27.955
- We share three of the same mothers.
- We've met.

32:28.085 --> 32:33.534
Have we? I'm sorry.
I've got a terrible memory for species.

32:33.638 --> 32:37.961
This is him, Ford. The would-you-like-
to-see-my-spaceship bloke.

32:39.513 --> 32:44.751
- Hello, Arthur.
- Tricia.

32:44.856 --> 32:47.254
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Trillian.

32:47.358 --> 32:51.133
This is my semi-half-brother Ix,
I'm sorry, Ford.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.531
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:54.152 --> 32:58.059
Would you excuse us
for a second, please?

32:58.164 --> 33:01.397
You went down on that little planet
and didn't call me?

33:01.501 --> 33:04.318
Sorry, I didn't know.
I had a galaxy to run.

33:04.422 --> 33:06.693
Hi, Tricia McMillan, right?

33:06.797 --> 33:09.947
I think he called you Trillian.
Which of us got the right one?

33:10.052 --> 33:12.617
I shortened it.
Something a little more spacey.

33:12.754 --> 33:15.285
Right. I was thinking
of changing mine to,

33:15.389 --> 33:17.330
I don't know, Arthoolia.

33:17.434 --> 33:21.460
That's a good one.
Well, this is weird.

33:21.564 --> 33:25.084
- How'd you get here?
- I just stuck out my thumb.

33:25.189 --> 33:28.802
- Right. In your pyjamas?
- I was in a hurry.

33:28.937 --> 33:31.007
OK. Did you know I was here?

33:31.111 --> 33:33.765
Don't flatter yourself.
I've got a spaceman too.

33:33.869 --> 33:36.564
Yeah, that's kinda like
the Dingo Shuffle, yeah.

33:36.695 --> 33:38.495
OK, look.

33:38.830 --> 33:42.646
I left you at the party. I feel bad, but
I was gonna call you when I got back.

33:42.750 --> 33:45.744
Well, there is no
going back now, is there?

33:46.872 --> 33:48.442
You do know what happened?

33:48.546 --> 33:51.320
Enough small talk.
We're on the run, remember?

33:51.424 --> 33:53.327
Excuse me, we're having a chat.

33:53.503 --> 33:55.876
Well, I think the girl's getting...
Boo.

33:56.006 --> 34:01.289
You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut
your face or I'll kick you in the zatch.

34:01.394 --> 34:02.957
- You wanna fight?
- OK.

34:03.061 --> 34:05.834
- No.
- I'm just kidding.

34:05.939 --> 34:09.384
I'm a kidder. Let's be friends.
Let's connect. You and I.

34:10.270 --> 34:12.340
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

34:12.444 --> 34:15.773
Popped right out of the box.
You foxy, yeah.

34:16.150 --> 34:19.318
Teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
He's a guest on my ship.

34:19.446 --> 34:21.818
He's a guest on my ship.

34:22.824 --> 34:24.864
I thought you said you stole it.

34:26.495 --> 34:29.364
Stole what?
What are we talking about?

34:30.998 --> 34:33.121
That doesn't sound good.

34:37.589 --> 34:40.952
- Are you OK?
- Just fabulous, thanks, Trill.

34:41.056 --> 34:43.803
A little help over here.
I'm in over my head.

34:43.929 --> 34:47.297
I'll take care of this. Good Zarquon,
do I have to do everything?

34:47.431 --> 34:48.625
Yes, I do.

34:48.728 --> 34:50.922
Hey, this is really pretty.

34:51.027 --> 34:53.556
- Don't.
- They're on our tail.

34:53.688 --> 34:56.061
Fire a gun. Launch a missile.
Do some damage.

35:05.567 --> 35:06.610
Stop that.

35:06.714 --> 35:08.733
Just kiddin'. I love it rough. Hit me.

35:08.837 --> 35:11.737
- Computer?
- <i>Hi, there.</i>

35:11.841 --> 35:13.902
<i>I'm Eddie, your computer.</i>

35:14.006 --> 35:17.741
<i>I'm pleased to report that it's a fleet</i>
<i>of 100 Vogon battle destroyers.</i>

35:17.845 --> 35:20.118
<i>They're sending you a message.</i>

35:20.222 --> 35:22.579
<i>This is Vice-President Questular Rontok.</i>

35:22.683 --> 35:26.092
<i>I am speaking to the kidnapper</i>
<i>of the President?</i>

35:26.221 --> 35:27.375
She digs me.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.631
<i>Surrender the stolen vessel at once</i>

35:29.766 --> 35:33.266
<i>or we will take action</i>
<i>as defined and permitted by...</i>

35:35.314 --> 35:39.259
<i>section 1-8 of the Galactic Interstellar</i>
<i>Space Bylaws...</i>

35:39.363 --> 35:42.722
<i>Zaphod, please come back now.</i>
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

35:42.826 --> 35:45.573
Leap to hyperspace. Come on.

35:45.699 --> 35:47.692
<i>Sure thing, fella.</i>

35:54.875 --> 35:55.875
No.

35:56.418 --> 36:01.785
Did they have proper
hyperspace authorisation?

36:01.889 --> 36:03.756
No, commander.

36:06.678 --> 36:11.251
Bring me the request
to pursue fugitive forms.

36:11.355 --> 36:13.342
I'm coming, sir.

36:15.896 --> 36:18.221
I'm boiling. Here's the form, sir.

36:21.693 --> 36:25.933
So are you along for the ride
or am I just dropping you somewhere?

36:26.037 --> 36:29.355
That depends. Where are you going?

36:29.459 --> 36:31.444
Where am I going?

36:32.537 --> 36:36.989
- You OK?
- Yeah. Don't suppose there's any tea.

36:37.093 --> 36:40.159
Yes, there is. Come on.
I'll show you the kitchen.

36:40.263 --> 36:44.743
When you see what I'm about to show you,
you'll beg me to take you with us.

36:44.848 --> 36:49.248
<i>The best drink in existence</i>
<i>is the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster,</i>

36:49.352 --> 36:54.046
<i>the effect of which is like having your</i>
<i>brains smashed out by a slice of lemon</i>

36:54.151 --> 36:56.716
<i>wrapped round a large gold brick.</i>

37:01.441 --> 37:04.359
- Belgium. Hold it one second.
- Belgium.

37:05.362 --> 37:08.225
Ape-man, Earth dude, sorry,
what's your name again?

37:08.329 --> 37:10.770
- Arthur.
- Right. Gorgeous.

37:10.875 --> 37:14.230
No hard feelings, OK?
Sorry to hear about your planet...

37:14.334 --> 37:16.111
- Earth.
- Yeah. I liked Earth.

37:16.216 --> 37:19.160
Got these boots there.
But don't mention it to the girl.

37:19.293 --> 37:23.033
Because if you do... I'll pull your
spleen out through your throat.

37:23.137 --> 37:26.038
- All right. Thanks, buddy.
- OK.

37:26.142 --> 37:29.169
Good stuff. Like those jammies.

37:31.972 --> 37:34.973
Zaphod, what's with the two-head thing?

37:35.726 --> 37:39.716
Oh, yeah. Apparently, you can't
be president with a whole brain.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.844
It's crazy.

37:41.949 --> 37:44.055
- Oh, so you carved it up?
- Yes.

37:44.159 --> 37:48.268
Parts of my personality weren't exactly
what you'd call presidential.

37:48.373 --> 37:50.320
You know what I'm talkin' about.

37:53.994 --> 37:56.567
<i>Your tea is ready.</i>

38:08.383 --> 38:13.251
I suppose I should've said
it resembles tea.

38:13.355 --> 38:16.126
So, two heads
is what does it for a girl?

38:16.231 --> 38:18.544
I mean, if I'd had two heads,
or three...

38:18.649 --> 38:20.802
Or your own spaceship.

38:21.772 --> 38:23.636
Anything else he's got two of?

38:23.740 --> 38:26.218
Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.

38:26.322 --> 38:30.558
What am I supposed to be like?
Green? Bleeping?

38:30.662 --> 38:33.435
I can fold my eyelids
inside out if you like.

38:33.540 --> 38:37.365
OK, look. Do you see this?

38:37.496 --> 38:41.530
This detects what you're craving
and makes it for you.

38:41.634 --> 38:43.867
<i>Enjoy your doughnut.</i>

38:47.631 --> 38:49.623
Do you see this?

38:52.761 --> 38:59.214
This toasts bread
while you're slicing it.

39:00.185 --> 39:05.091
We're on a spaceship, Arthur. In space.

39:05.195 --> 39:08.098
- I told you I wanted to get away.
- To Madagascar.

39:08.202 --> 39:11.644
That was some sort of test.

39:12.656 --> 39:14.393
And I failed.

39:14.497 --> 39:17.982
- How badly does it hurt?
- It doesn't feel great.

39:18.086 --> 39:20.109
No, I mean your chin.

39:20.213 --> 39:22.358
I might have an aspirin.

39:22.463 --> 39:23.663
Right.

39:30.507 --> 39:35.662
Tricia... Trillian, sorry.
There's something I have to tell you.

39:35.767 --> 39:39.048
- Please, don't.
- Showtime, Trill.

39:45.772 --> 39:48.342
I'm going to set up.
Buttons aren't toys.

39:48.446 --> 39:50.095
Buttons aren't toys.

39:50.200 --> 39:53.268
Anyway... When I saw
what I'm about to show you,

39:53.373 --> 39:58.019
that's when I realised
why I had to do what I did to my brain.

39:58.123 --> 40:01.285
I think. It's all a little...

40:02.080 --> 40:03.123
...shaky.

40:06.168 --> 40:09.288
I've seen it. It's rubbish.

40:12.883 --> 40:15.081
<i>Many millions of years ago,</i>

40:15.185 --> 40:18.623
<i>a race of hyperintelligent,</i>
<i>pan-dimensional beings</i>

40:18.727 --> 40:22.629
<i>got so fed up with the constant</i>
<i>bickering about the meaning of life,</i>

40:22.733 --> 40:25.680
<i>that they commissioned</i>
<i>two of their brightest and best</i>

40:25.812 --> 40:29.092
<i>to design and build</i>
<i>a stupendous super-computer</i>

40:29.196 --> 40:33.559
<i>to calculate the answer to life,</i>
<i>the universe and everything.</i>

40:33.663 --> 40:36.645
O Deep Thought,

40:36.749 --> 40:40.987
we want you to tell us the answer.

40:41.119 --> 40:43.317
<i>The answer to what?</i>

40:43.422 --> 40:48.040
The answer to life,
the universe, everything.

40:48.168 --> 40:52.159
We'd really like an answer.
Something simple.

40:52.263 --> 40:54.914
<i>I'd have to think about that.</i>

40:55.019 --> 41:00.465
<i>Return to this place in exactly</i>
<i>seven-and-a-half million years.</i>

41:01.974 --> 41:05.669
- Is it finished?
- No, there's more. They go back.

41:05.773 --> 41:10.846
- Seven-and-a-half million years later?
- That's right, they do.

41:27.541 --> 41:30.027
Deep Thought, do you have...

41:30.131 --> 41:34.539
<i>An answer for you?</i>
<i>Yes, but you're not going to like it.</i>

41:35.716 --> 41:38.791
- It doesn't matter. We must know it.
- <i>All right.</i>

41:38.895 --> 41:41.803
<i>The answer to the ultimate question</i>

41:43.765 --> 41:47.384
<i>of life, the universe</i>
<i>and everything...</i>

41:49.062 --> 41:50.142
<i>... is...</i>

41:56.987 --> 41:59.502
<i>... 42.</i>

41:59.602 --> 42:00.602
Yeah? What?

42:02.159 --> 42:03.159
42?

42:04.127 --> 42:08.275
<i>Yes, I thought it over quite thoroughly.</i>
<i>It's 42.</i>

42:08.380 --> 42:11.653
<i>It would've been simpler</i>
<i>to have known what the question was.</i>

42:11.757 --> 42:16.619
But it was the question.
The ultimate question. Of everything.

42:16.723 --> 42:18.589
<i>That's not a question.</i>

42:18.717 --> 42:22.412
<i>Only when you know the question</i>
<i>will you know what the answer means.</i>

42:22.517 --> 42:27.130
- Give us the ultimate question then.
- <i>I can't. But there is one who can.</i>

42:27.234 --> 42:31.171
<i>A computer that will calculate</i>
<i>the ultimate question.</i>

42:31.275 --> 42:33.845
<i>A computer of such infinite complexity,</i>

42:33.982 --> 42:38.027
<i>that life itself will form part</i>
<i>of its operational matrix.</i>

42:38.195 --> 42:42.275
<i>And you yourselves shall take on new,</i>
<i>more primitive forms,</i>

42:42.407 --> 42:48.113
<i>and go down into the computer</i>
<i>to navigate its 10-million-year program.</i>

42:48.246 --> 42:51.947
<i>I shall design this computer for you,</i>
<i>and it shall be called...</i>

42:57.464 --> 43:00.994
- That's it?
- That's it.

43:01.098 --> 43:04.955
You're looking for
the ultimate question? You? Why?

43:05.059 --> 43:07.835
I tried that.
Why? 42. Doesn't work.

43:07.939 --> 43:10.796
- Let's get it ready, baby.
- Why...

43:10.900 --> 43:14.008
...do you want to know
the ultimate question?

43:14.112 --> 43:17.060
Partly curiosity,
partly a sense of adventure,

43:17.234 --> 43:20.597
but mostly I think
it's for the fame and the money.

43:20.701 --> 43:22.849
You're President of the Galaxy.

43:22.953 --> 43:24.812
- Yes, Arman.
- Arthur.

43:24.916 --> 43:27.272
Whatever.
Presidential fame is temporary.

43:27.376 --> 43:31.153
I find the question, that's permanent.
It sticks.

43:31.290 --> 43:33.781
Plus, everyone thinks you're deep.
Win-win.

43:34.501 --> 43:39.157
We just hit that button and bam,
we're at Magrathea, I think.

43:39.261 --> 43:42.459
We've hit it twice and
we're still not there, but anyway...

43:42.593 --> 43:44.995
- You in?
- Always.

43:45.099 --> 43:47.875
- All right.
- I want to get off.

43:47.979 --> 43:51.424
- Sorry, what exactly are we doing?
- This.

43:55.647 --> 43:59.343
<i>The Infinite Improbability Drive</i>
<i>is a wonderful new method</i>

43:59.447 --> 44:02.267
<i>of crossing interstellar distances</i>
<i>in a few seconds,</i>

44:02.372 --> 44:05.520
<i>without all that tedious</i>
<i>mucking about in hyperspace.</i>

44:05.624 --> 44:08.856
<i>As the Improbability Drive</i>
<i>reaches infinite improbability,</i>

44:08.961 --> 44:12.943
<i>it passes through every conceivable</i>
<i>point in every conceivable universe</i>

44:13.047 --> 44:14.777
<i>almost simultaneously.</i>

44:14.881 --> 44:16.945
<i>So you're never sure</i>
<i>where you'll end up</i>

44:17.049 --> 44:19.658
<i>or even what species you'll be</i>
<i>when you get there.</i>

44:19.762 --> 44:22.701
<i>It's therefore important</i>
<i>to dress accordingly.</i>

44:22.806 --> 44:27.129
<i>The Drive was invented following</i>
<i>research into finite improbability</i>

44:27.304 --> 44:29.335
<i>often used to break the ice at parties</i>

44:29.439 --> 44:32.672
<i>by making all the molecules</i>
<i>in the hostess's undergarments</i>

44:32.776 --> 44:34.799
<i>leap one foot to the left</i>

44:34.903 --> 44:37.433
<i>in accordance with</i>
<i>the theory of indeterminacy.</i>

44:37.564 --> 44:41.094
<i>Many physicists said they</i>
<i>wouldn't stand for that sort of thing,</i>

44:41.198 --> 44:43.307
<i>partly because it debased science,</i>

44:43.412 --> 44:47.401
<i>but mostly because they didn't get</i>
<i>invited to those sort of parties.</i>

44:57.626 --> 45:01.072
Is this gonna happen
every time we hit that button?

45:01.176 --> 45:03.080
Very probably, yes.

45:03.215 --> 45:06.161
Ah, I think
the Earthman's about to be sick.

45:06.266 --> 45:09.130
In the trashcan, ape-man.
This ship's new.

45:10.055 --> 45:11.655
Come on.

45:11.974 --> 45:14.465
We have normality.

45:14.601 --> 45:16.179
Did it work? Are we there?

45:18.063 --> 45:22.219
Yeah. We're here. Magrathea.

45:22.323 --> 45:24.025
I don't think so. Eddie...

45:24.152 --> 45:26.110
What planet is this?

45:26.238 --> 45:28.020
<i>I'm checking for you.</i>

45:28.124 --> 45:33.109
Did you just pluck
one of my hairs? Off my head?

45:33.912 --> 45:36.737
<i>Thank you for waiting.</i>
<i>Sorry to disappoint,</i>

45:36.841 --> 45:38.908
<i>but this is not Magrathea.</i>

45:39.042 --> 45:42.791
<i>We are currently in orbit around</i>
<i>the planet Viltvodle Six.</i>

45:43.797 --> 45:45.790
Humma Kavula.

45:46.717 --> 45:51.628
Magrathea's gonna have to wait.
I got a score to settle on this planet.

45:52.472 --> 45:55.072
Humma Kavula.

45:59.646 --> 46:03.858
<i>In the beginning,</i>
<i>the universe was created.</i>

46:03.984 --> 46:08.776
<i>This made a lot of people very angry,</i>
<i>and is widely regarded as a bad move.</i>

46:10.907 --> 46:14.193
<i>Many races believed it was created</i>
<i>by some sort of god,</i>

46:14.328 --> 46:16.858
<i>though the Jatravartid people</i>
<i>of Viltvodle Six</i>

46:16.963 --> 46:21.905
<i>firmly believe that the entire universe</i>
<i>was sneezed out of the nose of a being</i>

46:22.009 --> 46:24.782
<i>called the Great Green Arkleseizure.</i>

46:24.886 --> 46:26.534
Humma Kavula.

46:26.638 --> 46:28.952
<i>The Jatravartids, who lived in fear</i>

46:29.056 --> 46:32.542
<i>of the time they called the</i>
<i>Coming of the Great White Handkerchief,</i>

46:32.646 --> 46:36.378
<i>were small blue creatures</i>
<i>with more than 50 arms each.</i>

46:36.482 --> 46:39.005
<i>They were unique in being</i>
<i>the only race in history</i>

46:39.110 --> 46:42.851
<i>to have invented</i>
<i>the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.</i>

46:44.775 --> 46:46.761
Mr President.

46:46.865 --> 46:48.568
Hey, all right. How you doin'?

46:48.695 --> 46:50.569
What have we here? I love it.

46:56.203 --> 46:58.317
Hey, I love you. Fantastic.

46:58.422 --> 47:01.027
You guys related? Don't go changing.

47:01.132 --> 47:03.194
Arthur, I want a drink.

47:03.298 --> 47:07.457
I think I've been here before.
Have I been here before?

47:11.093 --> 47:12.293
Lxxie.

47:13.262 --> 47:16.208
- I've been here before.
- Humma Kavula.

47:16.312 --> 47:17.912
Come on.

47:18.148 --> 47:20.548
Tricia, I...

47:25.941 --> 47:35.436
<i>Now we await</i>
<i>with eager expectation</i>

47:35.536 --> 47:40.736
<i>Thy handkerchief</i>
<i>to bring us back to Thee</i>

47:49.548 --> 47:51.375
Hello, Humma.

47:52.884 --> 47:57.252
- Join us. Sit down.
- Good to see you. Thanks. All right.

47:57.357 --> 47:59.462
The handkerchief is coming.

47:59.566 --> 48:05.430
Let us pray the Almighty will exhale
a breath of compassion on us all.

48:07.107 --> 48:11.021
So that's Humma Kavula.
I thought he was just swearing.

48:11.778 --> 48:16.063
We lift our noses, clogged and unblown,

48:16.167 --> 48:18.281
in reverence to you.

48:20.037 --> 48:24.943
Send the handkerchief, O Blessed One,
so that it may wipe us clean.

48:25.047 --> 48:30.747
We ask this and all things
in Thy precious and alliterative name.

48:39.681 --> 48:41.555
Bless you.

48:42.017 --> 48:44.337
We goin' in here?

48:44.441 --> 48:48.260
All right, I like it. It's big,
it's gold, it's fancy. Fancy pants.

48:48.364 --> 48:51.886
Zaphod Beeblebrox,
our infamous President.

48:51.990 --> 48:54.727
What brings you to our humble planet?

48:54.831 --> 48:58.939
- I think you know why I'm here.
- No, I don't think I do.

48:59.043 --> 49:00.742
I think you think you don't.

49:01.828 --> 49:04.664
But we both know you do.

49:05.499 --> 49:07.363
Eloquent as always.

49:07.467 --> 49:11.321
Your ability to articulate
never ceases to amaze.

49:11.426 --> 49:14.451
That's funny.
During the campaign, Humma,

49:14.556 --> 49:16.952
when you were my opponent
running against me,

49:17.056 --> 49:19.045
you said I was stupid.

49:38.699 --> 49:43.111
The election is ancient history,
Zaphod, but...

49:45.580 --> 49:47.445
...if memory serves, you won,

49:47.549 --> 49:50.238
proving that good looks
and charm

49:50.343 --> 49:55.840
win over brilliance
and the ability to govern.

50:00.095 --> 50:03.336
And, incidentally, you are stupid.

50:03.440 --> 50:06.005
Excuse me, Mr Humma, sir.

50:07.144 --> 50:10.257
I just want to say, there's been
some sort of terrible mix up

50:10.362 --> 50:12.758
cos, actually, he's not with us.

50:12.862 --> 50:15.766
We came to worship you.
He followed us and...

50:15.870 --> 50:18.612
He grew, didn't he. He's not that tall.

50:18.739 --> 50:23.733
You didn't come half-way across the
galaxy to settle a campaign grudge.

50:25.850 --> 50:27.285
Why are you here?

50:28.874 --> 50:31.533
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

50:31.637 --> 50:37.560
I've been stranded on a strange planet
for years, I haven't been avoiding you.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.012
You look great. You're doing well.

50:40.436 --> 50:42.135
You've grown, obviously.

50:43.013 --> 50:46.254
Wait. We don't know why we're here.

50:46.358 --> 50:49.968
We were trying to get to Magrathea
and our ship brought us here.

50:51.563 --> 50:55.062
How very, very improbable.

51:02.491 --> 51:05.271
I kept a few souvenirs
from my former life.

51:05.375 --> 51:08.286
Ah, the heady days of space piracy.

51:09.289 --> 51:16.039
But even an Infinite lmprobability Drive
requires coordinates.

51:16.171 --> 51:18.543
Which I happen to have.

51:18.674 --> 51:20.298
No, no, no.

51:20.425 --> 51:22.798
You don't get something
for nothing, Zaphod.

51:22.928 --> 51:25.542
You must bring me something in return.

51:25.646 --> 51:28.547
- What?
- A gun.

51:28.651 --> 51:30.590
- A gun?
- A very special gun.

51:30.694 --> 51:34.010
Designed by the greatest computer
ever invented.

51:34.114 --> 51:37.014
But the only way to find it
is to go to Magrathea.

51:37.118 --> 51:41.599
Fine. I'll get your gun.
Just give me the coordinates.

51:41.703 --> 51:44.484
And what will you give me
to ensure your return?

51:45.325 --> 51:47.733
My word as President.

51:49.037 --> 51:52.537
No. I need a hostage.

51:55.043 --> 52:02.256
Only, what does
Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?

52:06.054 --> 52:07.654
Come on.

52:11.059 --> 52:12.459
Oh, no.

52:13.020 --> 52:15.799
Hey, take it easy now. Think about this.

52:15.904 --> 52:19.055
No, stop it.
That kind of tickles.

52:19.159 --> 52:22.733
Two heads are better than one.
Double your pleasure.

52:23.530 --> 52:26.566
It's not fair. You need me.

52:26.700 --> 52:30.863
Come back. Don't leave me alone.

52:33.914 --> 52:35.907
Come back.

52:36.042 --> 52:39.820
I thought I alone
considered your boyfriend

52:39.925 --> 52:42.579
a narcissistic moron,
but the whole galaxy does.

52:42.684 --> 52:45.498
What about you?
"Excuse me, Mr Humma, sir."

52:45.602 --> 52:50.044
"We're not with him. We just came
to worship you." Very brave.

52:50.148 --> 52:52.132
Where the hell is Ford?

52:56.145 --> 53:02.593
By the left, march.
Left, right, left, right.

53:02.697 --> 53:06.987
Mr President,
we're here for your protection.

53:07.448 --> 53:10.069
Fire upon the kidnapper.

53:10.826 --> 53:12.147
<i>Hey, come on.</i>

53:12.252 --> 53:14.818
The President is the kidnapper.
You'll kill him.

53:16.916 --> 53:18.873
It's locked.

53:21.796 --> 53:24.168
Thank you, darling. I'll be in touch.

53:29.470 --> 53:31.926
Come on, Zaphod, man.

53:35.434 --> 53:38.176
- Hey, what did I miss?
- What have you been doing?

53:38.280 --> 53:41.761
Field research. So they found
where we are? Belgium bummer.

53:41.866 --> 53:44.609
They're shooting at us.
What are we going to do?

53:44.735 --> 53:47.976
- I have an idea.
- Pushing him out and running away?

53:48.080 --> 53:50.558
What? He's the one they want.

53:50.662 --> 53:52.900
You can't go out there.
What are you doing?

53:54.203 --> 53:57.157
- Back off.
- What's going on?

53:58.833 --> 54:02.112
I have the President
and I will kill him, I swear.

54:02.216 --> 54:06.161
- Could that actually kill him?
- I don't think so.

54:06.299 --> 54:08.452
It's an aerosol can.

54:08.556 --> 54:11.042
OK, frightened now, frightened.

54:12.680 --> 54:16.126
- Hi, little guy.
- Get her.

54:16.230 --> 54:19.226
- Zaphod, no, come on.
- Arthur.

54:20.021 --> 54:22.845
- Arthur.
- Tricia.

54:22.950 --> 54:25.941
- Arthur.
- Tricia. Wait.

54:34.910 --> 54:36.310
Arthur.

54:40.166 --> 54:43.167
Resistance is useless.

54:53.137 --> 54:56.886
<i>Bring her to Vogsphere</i>
<i>for processing, captain.</i>

54:58.643 --> 55:00.380
Where's the circus?

55:00.484 --> 55:03.137
They got her and it's my fault.
We have to go.

55:03.241 --> 55:04.689
Let's go.

55:08.277 --> 55:10.264
Computer, take us to Magrathea.

55:10.368 --> 55:12.848
What? No.
We've got to go after Tricia.

55:12.953 --> 55:14.313
- Who?
- Trillian.

55:14.418 --> 55:17.938
They've got Trillian,
you stupid half-brained git.

55:18.042 --> 55:20.409
Right, you're coming out.

55:21.207 --> 55:25.114
Computer, we don't want to go to
Magrathea, we want to follow the ships.

55:25.218 --> 55:28.876
<i>I'd love to, but my guidance system</i>
<i>has been deactivated.</i>

55:29.006 --> 55:30.085
Oh, come on.

55:30.216 --> 55:32.580
<i>I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault.</i>

55:32.684 --> 55:34.716
What you doing on this ship?

55:34.845 --> 55:36.416
- Ford?
- Marvin.

55:36.520 --> 55:38.921
I've been talking
to the ship's computer.

55:39.058 --> 55:40.058
And?

55:40.816 --> 55:42.352
It hates me.

55:42.728 --> 55:45.636
No. Eddie, computer,

55:45.741 --> 55:49.231
is there another way
to follow the ships?

55:49.360 --> 55:53.821
<i>Activating Emergency Escape Pod.</i>
<i>It's super-neat and fun to fly.</i>

55:56.242 --> 55:57.729
Unbelievable.

55:57.833 --> 56:02.111
I'm in. OK, Ford,
do you have any idea?

56:02.215 --> 56:04.495
- We'll press this button.
- No.

56:06.127 --> 56:09.128
- This button.
- OK. Nothing's... OK.

56:09.255 --> 56:11.055
Good man.

56:12.306 --> 56:15.874
- OK, we're wobbling...
- You forgot your towel.

56:15.978 --> 56:18.456
Get him off me. I'll kill him.

56:18.560 --> 56:21.042
- OK, Ford, there's a...
- Is that better?

56:21.146 --> 56:23.181
No, that's worse.

56:23.311 --> 56:26.551
- Do what... I don't need that.
- OK.

56:26.656 --> 56:29.388
Stop the rocking.
Marvin, any ideas?

56:29.493 --> 56:33.096
I have a million ideas.
They all point to certain death.

56:33.201 --> 56:34.606
Thanks, Marv.

57:20.743 --> 57:24.777
- Magrathea.
- No, we're on the Vogon planet.

57:24.881 --> 57:27.486
- Yes, it is. It's Magrathea.
- This is Vogsphere.

57:27.590 --> 57:30.740
- Yeah, Magrathea. I know it.
- No, it's not.

57:30.845 --> 57:34.371
- There is no Magrathea.
- Yes, it is.

57:36.075 --> 57:37.661
- What are you doing?
- They took my head.

57:37.765 --> 57:40.585
They have these
on Arcturan megafreighters.

57:40.689 --> 57:43.210
They use them
when they need to concentrate.

57:43.314 --> 57:45.549
- What is it?
- It's a thinking cap.

57:50.314 --> 57:52.437
There you go.

57:56.195 --> 58:00.229
That should give him some zest
for about ten minutes or so.

58:00.334 --> 58:03.776
Now I'm feeling much better
about our predicament.

58:25.099 --> 58:29.255
I checked the Guide for how
to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere.

58:29.359 --> 58:32.467
It said don't.
I'm assuming you have a better plan.

58:32.571 --> 58:35.138
Well, I kind of had this idea
that we could...

58:37.194 --> 58:39.401
- Did anyone see that?
- See what?

58:39.530 --> 58:41.404
What was it?

58:41.532 --> 58:45.826
Nothing, it's nothing.
It's just my imagination.

58:45.953 --> 58:50.154
OK, right. Now, everyone just stop
a minute, please, and look at me.

58:50.259 --> 58:55.160
There's definitely something
going on here.

58:56.922 --> 58:59.122
Just watch.

58:59.263 --> 59:01.251
Just watch.

59:04.680 --> 59:07.136
OK, I think we...

59:08.517 --> 59:09.976
You too.

59:11.020 --> 59:13.392
Yeah, what was that?

59:16.776 --> 59:18.768
Zaphod, what do you think?

59:22.073 --> 59:25.905
I think... Zarquon.
What was that?

59:26.911 --> 59:30.494
I'd make a suggestion,
but you wouldn't listen.

59:30.623 --> 59:33.531
- No one ever does.
- I have an idea.

59:33.635 --> 59:36.746
Ford. Kill it. Get rid of it.

59:45.137 --> 59:47.962
OK, don't think.

59:48.066 --> 59:50.543
Nobody think. No ideas.

59:50.647 --> 59:52.801
No theories. No nothing.

59:58.985 --> 01:00:01.599
This is crazy.
Trillian is in there somewhere.

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:06.518
- We need an idea to help save her.
- I have an...

01:00:06.622 --> 01:00:07.622
Run.

01:00:38.107 --> 01:00:40.230
You're supposed to stop.

01:00:49.452 --> 01:00:53.746
OK, so I'm not thinking.
Not thinking. No ideas coming.

01:00:56.584 --> 01:00:59.704
OK, this isn't an idea
that has any merit at all,

01:00:59.837 --> 01:01:03.669
but, Marvin, can you give me a hand?

01:01:06.135 --> 01:01:08.293
OK, where is she?

01:01:11.265 --> 01:01:14.100
Who, the director of robot arm repair?

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:20.303
Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of Blaard?

01:01:20.408 --> 01:01:23.602
No, Tricia Marie McMillan of Earth.

01:01:23.736 --> 01:01:25.314
Oh. Right.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.576
Sorry, no record of Earth.

01:01:35.373 --> 01:01:39.151
Galactic sector
ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?

01:01:39.256 --> 01:01:42.703
- Oh, yes.
- She's lying.

01:01:44.215 --> 01:01:47.548
She's skinny, and she's pretty,
and she's lying.

01:01:48.844 --> 01:01:51.418
Oh, yes, here we are. Earth.

01:01:53.432 --> 01:01:54.891
"Destroyed."

01:01:55.017 --> 01:01:58.341
Do you have
a second home planet?

01:01:58.446 --> 01:02:02.020
- Destroyed? That's impossible.
- That's what it says here.

01:02:02.149 --> 01:02:07.310
Says it was destroyed to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:17.953
Who in their right mind
gives an order to destroy a planet?

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:23.991
- He said the gray building, right?
- All the buildings are gray.

01:02:24.095 --> 01:02:27.496
"Give me a hand." Very funny.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.043
How am I supposed to drive this pod
with one arm? Stupid human.

01:02:35.474 --> 01:02:38.632
So, you need to go back
and fill that in.

01:02:38.736 --> 01:02:42.061
Then, make sure, when you fill in
the facilitating form...

01:02:42.189 --> 01:02:47.065
Leave this to me. I'm British.
I know how to queue.

01:02:48.696 --> 01:02:53.812
If you'd fill that form in for me,
and return it as soon as possible.

01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:58.233
- Writing implements to your left...
- You're President. Can you do anything?

01:02:58.337 --> 01:03:03.206
Presidents don't have power. Their job
is to draw attention away from it.

01:03:05.296 --> 01:03:07.327
Hey, how you doin'?

01:03:07.431 --> 01:03:12.123
Hey, it's me, your President.
What's goin' on? Thanks for coming.

01:03:12.228 --> 01:03:15.055
All right. I know that sponge.
All right.

01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:17.553
- Next.
- President coming through.

01:03:17.683 --> 01:03:20.637
How you doin', Pinhead?
No, really, it's me.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.302
I love kabuki. Look at that.

01:03:23.407 --> 01:03:25.390
Out the way.

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:29.440
Give us a kiss.

01:03:30.488 --> 01:03:33.351
Hi, I've come about
release of a prisoner.

01:03:33.455 --> 01:03:35.572
Prisoner release form.

01:03:38.954 --> 01:03:41.153
I don't believe you.

01:03:41.257 --> 01:03:43.206
These are the orders.

01:03:48.297 --> 01:03:50.290
"Love and kisses"?

01:03:51.092 --> 01:03:54.583
Now, according
to the Galactic Penal Code,

01:03:54.687 --> 01:03:59.379
the punishment for
a presidential kidnapping

01:03:59.483 --> 01:04:03.224
is to be fed to
the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:05.821
Good day.

01:04:07.775 --> 01:04:12.104
Get off of me. What the hell is that?

01:04:13.489 --> 01:04:17.736
No, wait.
There's been some kind of mistake.

01:04:20.246 --> 01:04:25.823
- Tick all the boxes on the right.
- Right. Got it.

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:27.904
Not that one.

01:04:28.009 --> 01:04:32.288
<i>What to do if you find yourself</i>
<i>stuck with no hope of rescue.</i>

01:04:32.392 --> 01:04:36.751
<i>Consider how lucky you are</i>
<i>that life has been good to you so far.</i>

01:04:36.855 --> 01:04:39.959
<i>Alternatively, if life</i>
<i>hasn't been good to you so far,</i>

01:04:40.064 --> 01:04:43.420
<i>which, given your current circumstances,</i>
<i>seems more likely,</i>

01:04:43.524 --> 01:04:47.731
<i>consider how lucky you are that</i>
<i>it won't be troubling you much longer.</i>

01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:54.060
Right, there we go.

01:04:54.164 --> 01:04:56.527
Kidnapping the President.

01:04:56.657 --> 01:05:01.064
Oh, no, she's not eligible
for release at this time.

01:05:01.168 --> 01:05:04.319
OK. Right.
Look, this is the President.

01:05:04.423 --> 01:05:06.530
OK. See, there?

01:05:06.634 --> 01:05:10.238
He says the kidnapping business
was a horrible misunderstanding.

01:05:10.343 --> 01:05:11.908
Oh, yeah.

01:05:12.012 --> 01:05:15.701
She meant nothing by it.
He's ordering you to let her go.

01:05:15.806 --> 01:05:20.540
But this isn't a presidential
release of prisoner form.

01:05:20.645 --> 01:05:22.632
Those are blue.

01:05:23.934 --> 01:05:28.015
- I'll stay here.
- All right. Hold that. OK.

01:05:32.693 --> 01:05:35.018
Oh, he's hungry today.

01:05:37.615 --> 01:05:39.157
That's blue. Right.

01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:44.318
- I'm not a journalist.
- We're just hanging out.

01:05:44.423 --> 01:05:46.987
OK, this is for Tricia McMillan.

01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:51.161
Tricia McMillan. OK.

01:05:53.297 --> 01:05:57.425
Sir, it's a release form.

01:05:57.551 --> 01:05:58.789
Thank you.

01:05:58.893 --> 01:06:02.043
She's free to go.

01:06:02.148 --> 01:06:04.215
Release her.

01:06:07.019 --> 01:06:10.843
Zaphod's here.
Well, then, that's fine then.

01:06:10.947 --> 01:06:12.574
Let's just go and get him.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.209
Who are we waiting for again?

01:06:24.257 --> 01:06:26.250
No, I'm serious.

01:06:28.219 --> 01:06:29.619
Tricia.

01:06:33.558 --> 01:06:35.551
- Tricia.
- Trill.

01:06:36.102 --> 01:06:39.010
- Hey, come on.
- You idiot.

01:06:39.115 --> 01:06:41.136
You signed the order to destroy Earth.

01:06:41.241 --> 01:06:43.053
- He did?
- I did?

01:06:43.157 --> 01:06:47.602
Yes. "Love and kisses, Zaphod"?
You didn't even read it, did you?

01:06:47.706 --> 01:06:52.489
Honey, I'm President of the Galaxy.
I don't get a lot of time for reading.

01:06:54.579 --> 01:06:56.400
An entire planet, my home,

01:06:56.504 --> 01:06:59.822
destroyed because you thought
they wanted your autograph.

01:06:59.926 --> 01:07:02.487
- They framed me.
- Are you an idiot?

01:07:02.591 --> 01:07:06.494
- Trillian.
- You knew. Why didn't you tell me?

01:07:06.818 --> 01:07:10.625
- He threatened me.
- Get a backbone, Arthur.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:16.313
Oh, a backbone? What about coming here
to rescue you? Thank you. My idea.

01:07:17.365 --> 01:07:18.603
Stupid.

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:25.761
- Got your arm.
- How considerate.

01:07:25.865 --> 01:07:30.238
Right, then, all those lucky enough
to have two arms, hold tight.

01:07:46.923 --> 01:07:50.037
The President tests my patience.

01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:54.957
This time I shall pursue him myself.
Ready my ship.

01:07:55.061 --> 01:07:57.974
Fantastic. At last.

01:08:03.273 --> 01:08:06.606
That's one hour for lunch, everybody.

01:08:07.402 --> 01:08:09.560
I think I'll have soup today.

01:08:11.656 --> 01:08:15.147
The Encyclopaedia Galactica,
<i>in its chapter on love,</i>

01:08:15.251 --> 01:08:18.651
<i>states that it is</i>
<i>far too complicated to define.</i>

01:08:18.755 --> 01:08:23.158
The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy <i>has this to say on love:</i>

01:08:23.334 --> 01:08:25.865
<i>"Avoid, if at all possible."</i>

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:28.825
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Arthur Dent has never read</i>

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:31.379
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

01:08:31.509 --> 01:08:35.459
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, come in.

01:08:35.596 --> 01:08:37.796
I didn't...

01:08:40.769 --> 01:08:42.169
Look...

01:08:42.527 --> 01:08:45.428
Trillian, I just wanted to say,
you were right,

01:08:45.533 --> 01:08:51.055
I should've told you, and I understand
totally if you're angry with me.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.854
For what it's worth,
I know how you must be feeling.

01:08:56.618 --> 01:09:00.947
- Can you hand me a towel?
- Yeah, sure, this...

01:09:02.415 --> 01:09:04.402
Thank you.

01:09:04.506 --> 01:09:07.501
Actually, what I was going to say was

01:09:08.796 --> 01:09:13.830
if I'd said yes to you
and gone to Madagascar,

01:09:13.934 --> 01:09:15.920
then neither of us would be here now.

01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:20.975
I just thought that might
count for something.

01:09:24.938 --> 01:09:26.466
It doesn't matter.

01:09:50.125 --> 01:09:55.741
All right, computer, take us to...
Where we headed again?

01:09:55.846 --> 01:09:58.377
OK, I'm gonna get you another lemon.

01:09:59.385 --> 01:10:01.377
All right.

01:10:05.683 --> 01:10:08.085
<i>Engaging Improbability Drive.</i>

01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:12.047
No, Zaphod, no.
Buttons are not toys. What did you do?

01:10:12.152 --> 01:10:14.021
<i>Magrathean coordinates accepted.</i>

01:10:21.866 --> 01:10:24.435
<i>It blows my circuits to tell you</i>

01:10:24.539 --> 01:10:27.951
<i>that we're in orbit,</i>
<i>at an altitude of 300 miles,</i>

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.693
<i>around the legendary planet</i>
<i>of Magrathea.</i>

01:10:31.797 --> 01:10:33.797
Magrathea.

01:10:41.135 --> 01:10:43.127
Unbelievable.

01:10:45.681 --> 01:10:47.674
Incredible.

01:10:48.684 --> 01:10:51.140
It's even worse
than I thought it would be.

01:10:52.354 --> 01:10:56.639
<i>Greetings. This is a recorded</i>
<i>announcement as we are all out.</i>

01:10:56.743 --> 01:11:00.185
<i>The Commercial Council of Magrathea</i>
<i>thanks you for your visit,</i>

01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:03.645
<i>but regrets that the entire planet</i>
<i>is temporarily closed.</i>

01:11:03.749 --> 01:11:07.520
<i>If you'd like to leave your name</i>
<i>and a planet where you can be contacted,</i>

01:11:07.624 --> 01:11:09.743
<i>kindly do so at the tone.</i>

01:11:10.831 --> 01:11:14.738
- How can a planet be closed?
- Zarkin' A, cousin.

01:11:14.842 --> 01:11:18.251
OK, computer, keep going.
Take us down.

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.958
<i>I'd be happy to.</i>

01:11:21.592 --> 01:11:26.664
<i>It is gratifying that your enthusiasm</i>
<i>for our planet continues unabated.</i>

01:11:26.768 --> 01:11:29.385
<i>As a token of our appreciation,</i>

01:11:29.517 --> 01:11:32.547
<i>we hope you will enjoy</i>
<i>the two thermo-nuclear missiles</i>

01:11:32.651 --> 01:11:35.895
<i>we've just sent</i>
<i>to converge with your craft.</i>

01:11:36.607 --> 01:11:39.015
<i>To ensure on-going quality of service,</i>

01:11:39.151 --> 01:11:43.398
<i>your death may be monitored</i>
<i>for training purposes. Thank you.</i>

01:11:44.031 --> 01:11:48.316
<i>I'm delighted to tell you there are two</i>
<i>nuclear missiles heading right for us.</i>

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.779
<i>If you don't mind,</i>
<i>I'm going to take evasive action.</i>

01:11:56.126 --> 01:11:59.323
<i>Something's jamming</i>
<i>my guidance system.</i>

01:11:59.428 --> 01:12:01.379
<i>Impact minus 45 seconds.</i>

01:12:05.135 --> 01:12:07.342
Computer, do something.

01:12:07.471 --> 01:12:11.765
<i>Sure. Handing over manual control.</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:12:22.444 --> 01:12:24.484
I need some help.

01:12:25.281 --> 01:12:27.819
I can't do this without my third arm.

01:12:30.661 --> 01:12:32.903
Arthur, grab my hand.

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:47.041
- Did we lose 'em?
- No, they're coming right at us.

01:12:49.722 --> 01:12:53.417
- Why don't I just press this?
- No, we're not back to normal yet.

01:12:53.521 --> 01:12:55.548
- What will happen?
- I don't know.

01:12:55.653 --> 01:12:59.642
Don't do it. We're here.
No telling where it'll send us.

01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:04.567
- No, sod it all.
- No.

01:13:10.743 --> 01:13:12.735
Where are we?

01:13:16.832 --> 01:13:20.533
- Exactly where we were.
- And the missiles?

01:13:21.587 --> 01:13:27.127
Apparently, they've turned
into a bowl of petunias.

01:13:28.636 --> 01:13:31.506
And a very surprised-looking whale.

01:13:31.639 --> 01:13:38.887
<i>And an improbability factor</i>
of <i>8,767, 128 to 1 against.</i>

01:13:39.813 --> 01:13:41.806
We have normality.

01:13:42.775 --> 01:13:45.222
Normality, right.

01:13:45.326 --> 01:13:48.236
We can talk about normality
till the cows come home.

01:13:49.406 --> 01:13:52.437
- What is normal?
- What's home?

01:13:52.541 --> 01:13:54.242
What are cows?

01:13:55.412 --> 01:13:58.276
A proper cup of tea
would restore my normality.

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:02.613
<i>It is important to note that suddenly,</i>
<i>and against all probability,</i>

01:14:02.718 --> 01:14:05.575
<i>a sperm whale had been</i>
<i>called into existence</i>

01:14:05.679 --> 01:14:09.790
<i>several miles above</i>
<i>the surface of an alien planet.</i>

01:14:09.895 --> 01:14:12.710
<i>Since this is not a tenable position</i>
<i>for a whale,</i>

01:14:12.814 --> 01:14:17.794
<i>this innocent creature had very little</i>
<i>time to come to terms with its identity.</i>

01:14:17.898 --> 01:14:20.462
<i>This is what it thought as it fell:</i>

01:14:20.567 --> 01:14:23.760
<i>What's happening? Who am I?</i>

01:14:23.864 --> 01:14:27.523
<i>Why am I here? What's my purpose?</i>
<i>What do I mean by "who am l"?</i>

01:14:27.653 --> 01:14:29.768
<i>OK, calm down, get a grip now.</i>

01:14:29.872 --> 01:14:33.936
<i>This is an interesting sensation.</i>
<i>A sort of tingling in my...</i>

01:14:34.041 --> 01:14:39.076
<i>I better start finding names for things.</i>
<i>Let's call it a tail. Yeah, tail.</i>

01:14:39.206 --> 01:14:43.240
<i>What's this roaring sound whooshing past</i>
<i>what I'm gonna call my head?</i>

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:45.450
<i>Wind. Is that a good name? That'll do.</i>

01:14:45.554 --> 01:14:48.825
<i>Yay, this is really exciting.</i>
<i>I'm dizzy with anticipation.</i>

01:14:48.929 --> 01:14:51.455
<i>Or is it the wind?</i>
<i>There's a lot of that now.</i>

01:14:51.559 --> 01:14:55.632
<i>And what's this thing coming towards me</i>
<i>very fast? So big and flat and round.</i>

01:14:55.764 --> 01:15:00.836
<i>It needs a big wide-sounding name</i>
<i>like ow, ound, round, ground.</i>

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:05.479
<i>That's it, ground. I wonder if it will</i>
<i>be friends with me. Hello, ground.</i>

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:11.639
<i>The only thing that went through</i>
<i>the mind of the bowl of petunias</i>

01:15:11.743 --> 01:15:15.783
<i>as it fell was, "Oh, no, not again."</i>

01:15:17.036 --> 01:15:22.652
<i>Many have speculated that if we knew</i>
<i>why the petunias had thought that,</i>

01:15:22.756 --> 01:15:28.171
<i>we should know a lot more about the</i>
<i>nature of the universe than we do now.</i>

01:15:32.468 --> 01:15:34.704
What are those things?

01:15:34.809 --> 01:15:38.166
They're portals to another dimension.

01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:42.761
Right. I don't suppose this portal
has central heating, does it?

01:15:48.817 --> 01:15:50.599
This is the one.

01:15:50.704 --> 01:15:55.155
This will all end in tears,
I just know it.

01:15:58.035 --> 01:16:00.193
Right here.

01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:07.069
OK, in we go.

01:16:07.173 --> 01:16:12.286
We can't just step into that... that.
We don't know where it leads.

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:14.506
If we pick the wrong one,

01:16:14.635 --> 01:16:18.336
we just come back,
we pick another one. It's no biggie.

01:16:18.472 --> 01:16:22.047
What? Yeah, it's a big biggie, Ford.
A big biggie.

01:16:22.151 --> 01:16:27.132
What if it rips us all into
tiny little atomic particle thingies?

01:16:27.236 --> 01:16:30.760
This is the right one. I have a hunch.

01:16:30.865 --> 01:16:35.061
- Ford.
- His hunches are good.

01:16:35.165 --> 01:16:37.558
Arthur, I say we go.

01:16:37.662 --> 01:16:43.524
Go with the hunch of a man
whose brain is fuelled by lemons?

01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:45.276
This is suicide.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:49.364
- I think I resent that.
- I don't care.

01:16:49.469 --> 01:16:52.370
I'm getting hostility from you, Alex...

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:56.047
- Arthur.
- Have you ever tried yoga?

01:16:57.219 --> 01:17:00.837
- Trillian.
- I think that's supposed to happen.

01:17:05.686 --> 01:17:07.975
She's gone. Ford, she's gone.

01:17:09.148 --> 01:17:11.437
Arthur, don't panic.

01:17:13.861 --> 01:17:17.811
- Ford.
- Hey, wait for me.

01:17:31.378 --> 01:17:32.978
Come on.

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:35.206
Idiot. Come on.

01:18:00.282 --> 01:18:03.939
No, don't leave.
Come on, just start.

01:18:04.043 --> 01:18:07.156
I told you this would end in tears.

01:18:07.289 --> 01:18:08.889
Did you?

01:18:18.717 --> 01:18:20.377
Geronimo.

01:18:23.097 --> 01:18:24.697
Far out.

01:18:27.643 --> 01:18:29.796
This is it.

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:32.351
Deep Thought. I'm a-coming.

01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:39.978
So, this is how it's all going to end,
is it?

01:18:42.366 --> 01:18:46.484
Me, alone on a dead planet,
with a manically depressed robot.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.526
You think you've got problems.

01:18:48.631 --> 01:18:51.659
What if you are
a manically depressed robot?

01:18:51.792 --> 01:18:53.785
Excuse me.

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:04.677
- Who are you?
- No, my name is not important.

01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:08.337
You must come with me.

01:19:08.441 --> 01:19:12.718
- Get away.
- Terrible events are afoot.

01:19:12.823 --> 01:19:16.304
You must come or you'll be late.

01:19:16.408 --> 01:19:18.680
- Late? What for?
- What?

01:19:18.785 --> 01:19:24.282
No. What's your name, Earthman?

01:19:25.242 --> 01:19:27.606
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- Well...

01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:30.455
Well, late as in
"the late Dentarthurdent."

01:19:31.207 --> 01:19:35.074
It's a sort of threat, do you see? No.

01:19:35.211 --> 01:19:38.202
- No.
- Your friends are safe.

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:41.500
- You can trust me.
- A man who won't tell me his name?

01:19:43.302 --> 01:19:46.332
OK, my name is...

01:19:46.436 --> 01:19:50.344
My name is... is... is...
Slartibartfast.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.604
I said it wasn't important.

01:19:57.274 --> 01:20:01.486
Well... So my friends are safe?

01:20:01.612 --> 01:20:03.015
Let me show you.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:09.033
I could calculate your chances
of survival, but you won't like it.

01:20:33.978 --> 01:20:36.758
Did you know we built planets?

01:20:36.862 --> 01:20:40.022
Oh, yes, fascinating trade.

01:20:40.985 --> 01:20:45.640
Doing the coastlines
was always my favourite.

01:20:45.745 --> 01:20:50.895
We used to have endless fun doing the
little fiddly bits around the fjords.

01:20:50.999 --> 01:20:56.489
But then the galactic economy collapsed,
and seeing that custom-built planets

01:20:56.593 --> 01:21:00.628
are a bit of a luxury commodity...

01:21:02.173 --> 01:21:06.035
Come with me because there's
been a terrible mix-up with your planet.

01:21:06.139 --> 01:21:08.371
Best laid plans of mice, you know.

01:21:08.476 --> 01:21:11.917
- And men.
- What?

01:21:12.021 --> 01:21:14.055
Best laid plans of mice and men.

01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:18.895
Yes, well, I don't think men
have much to do with it. Here.

01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:01.845
I must warn you,

01:22:01.949 --> 01:22:05.392
we're going to pass through,
well, a sort of gateway thing.

01:22:05.528 --> 01:22:07.726
It may disturb you.

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:09.980
It scares the willies out of me.

01:22:41.522 --> 01:22:45.105
Welcome to our factory floor.

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:10.875
All right.

01:23:12.428 --> 01:23:15.298
Yeah, this is it.

01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:20.550
This is it.

01:23:20.978 --> 01:23:24.840
O great Deep Thought.

01:23:24.944 --> 01:23:26.648
We have travelled long...

01:23:28.736 --> 01:23:30.479
...and far.

01:23:30.613 --> 01:23:36.062
Have you calculated
the ultimate question of life,

01:23:36.166 --> 01:23:38.567
the universe and everything?

01:23:39.413 --> 01:23:41.193
<i>No.</i>

01:23:41.293 --> 01:23:43.077
- What?
- <i>I've been watching TV.</i>

01:23:43.959 --> 01:23:46.533
<i>I designed</i>
<i>another computer to do that.</i>

01:23:48.088 --> 01:23:50.408
Oh, right, I forgot. Is it here?

01:23:50.513 --> 01:23:53.249
<i>No, it's not here. It's another world.</i>

01:23:53.353 --> 01:23:55.467
It's on another world.

01:23:55.596 --> 01:23:59.087
<i>It is another world, stupid.</i>

01:23:59.191 --> 01:24:01.585
<i>Or it was until the Vogons destroyed it</i>

01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:04.058
<i>to make way</i>
<i>for a hyperspace expressway.</i>

01:24:04.271 --> 01:24:06.469
Well... OK.

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:08.680
You sure you don't have the question,

01:24:08.784 --> 01:24:12.267
or a way to, you know,
access it or something?

01:24:12.371 --> 01:24:14.320
I think I've done a lot to get here.

01:24:14.448 --> 01:24:17.817
<i>Oh, shh. The show's back on.</i>

01:24:23.249 --> 01:24:27.321
Well, I don't wanna bother you,
so I'm gonna... Good stuff.

01:24:27.426 --> 01:24:31.826
Great. I'm gonna go find something
else for my entire life to be about.

01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:35.203
Zaphod, there's the gun.

01:24:35.308 --> 01:24:37.583
- Gun?
- That Humma sent you for.

01:24:37.687 --> 01:24:42.170
- You gave him your head.
- Why'd I do that?

01:24:42.274 --> 01:24:43.928
- OK.
- That's stupid.

01:24:44.061 --> 01:24:49.138
O Deep Thought,
we were told that there is a gun.

01:25:03.956 --> 01:25:06.193
There you are.

01:25:06.297 --> 01:25:07.945
Look familiar?

01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:11.573
So it wasn't destroyed?

01:25:11.677 --> 01:25:15.919
Actually, it was.
This is a backup. Earth Mark II.

01:25:19.054 --> 01:25:20.846
So you made the Earth?

01:25:21.807 --> 01:25:24.559
Not me alone, but I did my part.

01:25:24.685 --> 01:25:27.964
Ever heard of a place,
I think it's called Norway?

01:25:28.069 --> 01:25:31.931
That was one of mine.
I... I got an award for it.

01:25:41.619 --> 01:25:45.070
All right, Frank? That's Frank.

01:25:47.082 --> 01:25:49.538
They've nearly finished the oceans.

01:25:58.969 --> 01:26:00.290
Zaphod.

01:26:00.395 --> 01:26:02.380
Here, it's...

01:26:04.892 --> 01:26:07.922
It's just like Humma said.

01:26:08.026 --> 01:26:10.589
- Now you can go get your head back.
- Hey, Ford.

01:26:10.694 --> 01:26:13.175
It's been nice knowing you,
you zarkin' frood.

01:26:13.279 --> 01:26:14.279
No.

01:26:15.402 --> 01:26:17.639
This is a bust too.

01:26:17.743 --> 01:26:21.939
Hey, man. You know,
you must really be frustrated.

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:25.064
You go through all you have,
you don't get an answer,

01:26:25.168 --> 01:26:27.903
which means no money or fame,
which you deserve...

01:26:28.008 --> 01:26:33.206
<i>The Point-of-View Gun, conveniently,</i>
<i>does precisely what its name suggests.</i>

01:26:33.337 --> 01:26:35.337
Fantastic.

01:26:36.966 --> 01:26:39.920
<i>If you point it at someone</i>
<i>and pull the trigger,</i>

01:26:40.052 --> 01:26:42.793
<i>they instantly see things</i>
<i>from your point of view.</i>

01:26:42.898 --> 01:26:44.715
Give me that thing.

01:26:44.849 --> 01:26:46.751
<i>It was designed by Deep Thought,</i>

01:26:46.856 --> 01:26:50.758
<i>but commissioned by a consortium</i>
<i>of intergalactic angry housewives</i>

01:26:50.862 --> 01:26:53.257
<i>who, after arguments</i>
<i>with their husbands,</i>

01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:56.726
<i>were sick of ending</i>
<i>those arguments with the phrase,</i>

01:26:56.861 --> 01:26:58.937
<i>"You just don't get it, do you?"</i>

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.977
And you're right,
I shouldn't be so upset

01:27:04.081 --> 01:27:08.619
because life goes on, you know,
and I should just go on with it.

01:27:09.248 --> 01:27:11.573
Shoot him again.

01:27:14.837 --> 01:27:18.616
Hitchhiking's good. Towels are good too.

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.995
- Say what?
- That is brilliant.

01:27:22.099 --> 01:27:24.164
What's goin'...?

01:27:24.268 --> 01:27:27.050
I can see why Humma Kavula
would want one of these.

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:31.006
- We better get back. Arthur's waiting.
- Who cares?

01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:35.637
I do. Especially since we're somewhat
of an endangered species, thanks to you.

01:27:35.741 --> 01:27:37.856
Why so edgy, baby doll? Relax.

01:27:37.985 --> 01:27:40.772
You wanna know why I'm edgy?

01:27:42.114 --> 01:27:44.812
Of course you're edgy.
Your planet's been blown up

01:27:44.916 --> 01:27:48.776
and you've been tooling around
with the guy who signed the order.

01:27:50.956 --> 01:27:53.109
You actually wanted
to know the question

01:27:53.214 --> 01:27:55.950
because you always wondered
if there was more to life

01:27:56.054 --> 01:27:59.952
and now you're crushed
because you find out there really isn't.

01:28:00.056 --> 01:28:04.592
Hey, fantastic. Psychedelic.

01:28:06.388 --> 01:28:10.167
You've got no home, no family,
and you're stuck with me,

01:28:10.271 --> 01:28:13.885
another in a long line of men
who doesn't really get you.

01:28:16.315 --> 01:28:18.308
That's not true.

01:28:21.028 --> 01:28:25.405
And you're worried you might have blown
it with the one guy who really does.

01:28:30.955 --> 01:28:33.031
Oh, baby doll.

01:28:33.749 --> 01:28:35.742
Give me that thing.

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:42.797
It won't affect me.
I'm already a woman.

01:28:53.936 --> 01:28:56.225
It's OK.
It's only a couple of little mice.

01:28:59.984 --> 01:29:03.483
VoilÃ . Himalayas. Good, eh?

01:29:06.949 --> 01:29:09.274
Earthman, you must realise

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:12.523
that the planet you lived
on was commissioned,

01:29:12.628 --> 01:29:15.955
paid for and run by mice.

01:29:18.752 --> 01:29:21.993
When you say mice,
do you mean the little furry creatures

01:29:22.097 --> 01:29:23.992
with whiskers, ears, cheese?

01:29:24.096 --> 01:29:29.124
Yeah, but they're protrusions into our
dimension of hyperintelligent beings.

01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:32.721
I don't know this cheese
of which you speak,

01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:36.545
but they were there on Earth
as mice experimenting on you.

01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:41.556
I see where you've become confused now.
You see, we were experimenting on them.

01:29:41.692 --> 01:29:45.516
Ah, no, well, yeah, no.
That's what they wanted you to think,

01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:49.562
but you were actually
elements in their computer program.

01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:53.771
Actually, this explains a lot.

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:56.357
All my life,
I've had this strange feeling

01:29:56.461 --> 01:29:59.570
there's something big and sinister
going on in the world.

01:29:59.675 --> 01:30:03.832
No, that's normal paranoia.
Everyone in the universe gets that.

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:10.291
Perhaps I'm old and tired,
but the chances of finding out

01:30:10.396 --> 01:30:13.085
what's actually going on
are so absurdly remote

01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:17.300
that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy.

01:30:17.404 --> 01:30:19.802
I'd much rather be happy
than right any day.

01:30:19.939 --> 01:30:21.896
- And are you?
- No.

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.642
That's where it all falls down.

01:30:35.955 --> 01:30:38.078
Here you are then.

01:30:52.555 --> 01:30:54.179
Is this...?

01:31:08.195 --> 01:31:10.437
It's all there.

01:31:11.574 --> 01:31:13.810
You know, it all works.

01:31:13.914 --> 01:31:15.985
Welcome home.

01:31:37.933 --> 01:31:40.003
- There you are.
- Surprise.

01:31:40.107 --> 01:31:43.020
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:44.592
Is that tea?

01:31:44.696 --> 01:31:49.013
- First, our hosts attacked us.
- Right.

01:31:49.117 --> 01:31:52.557
But then they made up for it
by making us

01:31:52.662 --> 01:31:54.982
this amazing meal.

01:31:55.868 --> 01:31:59.201
It's so... Everything's right.
Everything's delicious.

01:32:00.831 --> 01:32:03.490
Oh, come on, that's lovely.

01:32:03.594 --> 01:32:05.873
We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

01:32:10.049 --> 01:32:14.649
The talking mice. Cool.

01:32:14.854 --> 01:32:19.970
- Sit, Earthman.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you for that.

01:32:20.935 --> 01:32:24.381
- Please, drink.
- Excuse me.

01:32:24.485 --> 01:32:27.843
- Is there anything else?
- No, we're quite happy, thank you.

01:32:27.947 --> 01:32:31.637
Good, I'll be outside, so...

01:32:31.741 --> 01:32:33.974
You were right.

01:32:34.078 --> 01:32:35.864
- Please, drink.
- Yes.

01:32:36.492 --> 01:32:38.449
He was right.

01:32:38.577 --> 01:32:40.398
Now, to business.

01:32:40.502 --> 01:32:42.278
To business.

01:32:42.382 --> 01:32:43.382
Eat.

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.159
Sorry.

01:32:46.301 --> 01:32:50.200
We've spent a lot of time on your planet
looking for this ultimate question.

01:32:50.305 --> 01:32:53.872
Only to have it blow up in our faces.
Literally.

01:32:53.976 --> 01:32:57.459
Which is why you're here.
We've been offered a lucrative contract

01:32:57.563 --> 01:32:59.586
to do several 5-D TV chat shows.

01:32:59.690 --> 01:33:02.212
But here's the point.
We must have product.

01:33:02.317 --> 01:33:05.513
We need the ultimate question,
or one that sounds ultimate.

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:07.926
- Of course.
- We've rebuilt the planet.

01:33:08.031 --> 01:33:10.887
Now all we need
is the missing piece of the puzzle.

01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:13.183
- Which happens to be your brain.
- Right.

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:14.524
More tea?

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:17.352
Sorry, did you just say
you need my brain?

01:33:17.457 --> 01:33:19.738
Yes, to complete the programme.

01:33:22.705 --> 01:33:25.409
You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:30.369
- Hardly.
- Hardly? Cheeky mouse.

01:33:34.884 --> 01:33:37.414
Zaphod. Trillian.

01:33:37.518 --> 01:33:38.518
Ford.

01:33:39.896 --> 01:33:41.383
What was in that food?

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:45.215
What was in my tea?

01:33:45.319 --> 01:33:47.884
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

01:33:51.358 --> 01:33:53.223
Just wait a sodding minute.

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:56.016
You want a question
that goes with the answer 42?

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.767
What about, what's 6x7?

01:33:57.871 --> 01:34:01.394
Or how many Vogons
does it take to change a light bulb?

01:34:01.499 --> 01:34:05.277
Here's one: How many roads
must a man walk down?

01:34:06.665 --> 01:34:08.652
Hey, that's not bad.

01:34:08.756 --> 01:34:15.121
Fine, take it, cos my head
is filled with questions,

01:34:15.257 --> 01:34:17.494
and no answer to any one of them

01:34:17.598 --> 01:34:21.206
has ever brought me
one iota of happiness.

01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:22.875
Except for one.

01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:25.881
The one. The only question
I've ever wanted an answer to.

01:34:25.986 --> 01:34:27.636
Is she the one?

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:32.137
The answer bloody well isn't 42,
it's yes.

01:34:32.241 --> 01:34:37.765
Undoubtedly, unequivocally,
unabashedly, yes.

01:34:37.869 --> 01:34:40.734
And for one week,

01:34:40.866 --> 01:34:45.612
one week in my sad little blip
of an existence,

01:34:47.873 --> 01:34:49.949
it made me happy.

01:34:52.127 --> 01:34:53.531
That's a good answer.

01:34:53.635 --> 01:34:56.826
Rubbish. We don't want to be happy.
We want to be famous.

01:34:56.930 --> 01:35:00.581
- What's this "Is she the one" tripe?
- Take his brain.

01:35:00.685 --> 01:35:03.881
No, don't take the brain.
Don't take the brain, mice.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.554
It wasn't me. I'm famous.

01:35:16.658 --> 01:35:19.016
Shoot him, quickly, shoot him.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.572
Oh, bollocks.

01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:31.165
I'm gonna be sick.

01:35:34.753 --> 01:35:36.129
Belgium.

01:35:44.597 --> 01:35:46.091
Follow me.

01:35:46.682 --> 01:35:49.168
Left, right, left, right.

01:35:49.272 --> 01:35:51.272
Attention.

01:35:55.274 --> 01:35:58.228
Thanks a lot
for leaving me behind.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.558
Though I can't say I blame you.

01:36:00.663 --> 01:36:04.350
Mr President,
we're here for your protection.

01:36:04.454 --> 01:36:06.770
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

01:36:06.874 --> 01:36:07.874
Fire.

01:36:10.039 --> 01:36:11.039
No.

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:16.783
What's all the fuss about?

01:36:16.887 --> 01:36:19.704
Vogons are the worst marksmen
in the galaxy.

01:36:19.808 --> 01:36:24.923
- For God's sake, stop.
- Cease fire.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:33.553
Now I've got a headache.

01:36:44.281 --> 01:36:45.681
Marvin.

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:47.612
Oh, no.

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:53.120
He's got a towel, run away.

01:36:55.334 --> 01:36:58.326
I'm gonna get us outta here.
How do you drive this thing?

01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:59.749
What's going on?

01:37:02.174 --> 01:37:04.131
We need that gun.

01:37:05.302 --> 01:37:08.220
Come on. Get this ship started.
Come on. Start.

01:37:09.348 --> 01:37:11.379
Come on. Oh, fire, fire.

01:37:11.483 --> 01:37:12.804
Fire, fire.

01:37:17.439 --> 01:37:19.637
He's locked it from the other side.

01:37:19.742 --> 01:37:21.887
We'll have to go the other way.

01:37:21.991 --> 01:37:23.895
Come on, let's go.

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:30.243
Stop.

01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:41.915
Stop it. Stop shooting at us.

01:38:00.983 --> 01:38:04.684
Oh, I feel so depressed.

01:38:06.071 --> 01:38:10.983
I can't face another day.

01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:14.661
What's the point?

01:38:22.713 --> 01:38:25.002
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:38:30.679 --> 01:38:33.550
Sorry about your spaceship, Arthur.

01:38:39.104 --> 01:38:41.302
Marvin, you saved our lives.

01:38:41.407 --> 01:38:44.684
I know. Wretched, isn't it?

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:53.194
You got to ask yourself,
what's the point?

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:55.367
Take it away.

01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:08.912
You could do all of that, but it's
not gonna... I'll ask... I'll just ask.

01:39:09.017 --> 01:39:12.793
I've just been informed
by some of the lads

01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:15.294
that since we're so near completion,

01:39:15.398 --> 01:39:17.798
we're gonna go ahead and finish Earth.

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:23.510
Well, we can put it back exactly
as it was when you left, you know.

01:39:23.615 --> 01:39:26.970
Unless there's...

01:39:27.074 --> 01:39:30.604
there's, you know,
anything you want to change.

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:38.038
Something you think
your planet could do without.

01:39:39.498 --> 01:39:41.298
Yeah. Me.

01:39:43.252 --> 01:39:45.252
Oh. Hello?

01:39:45.554 --> 01:39:49.294
No, as is. Yep, leave it. Yep.

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:52.830
Let's go somewhere.

01:39:52.935 --> 01:39:55.498
Definitely. Where did you have in mind?

01:39:55.602 --> 01:39:58.848
I know this great restaurant
at the end of the universe.

01:39:59.643 --> 01:40:01.969
I am a little peckish.

01:40:03.981 --> 01:40:06.761
I need to go to Humma's.
He's got something of mine.

01:40:06.865 --> 01:40:12.482
- I think. I'm so confused.
- Don't worry, baby. We'll sort it out.

01:40:12.615 --> 01:40:16.228
All right, let's trip the light
fantastic, baby. Just you and me.

01:40:16.332 --> 01:40:17.932
Come on.

01:40:18.287 --> 01:40:22.332
- You got your towel?
- Yeah. Why? Am I going to need it?

01:40:22.458 --> 01:40:25.865
- Only always.
- Right. Yeah.

01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:30.339
I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel.

01:40:35.012 --> 01:40:37.883
OK. Hold tight.

01:40:41.393 --> 01:40:46.593
<i>Stand by for commencement</i>
<i>of life cycle. In three, two, one...</i>

01:40:46.698 --> 01:40:48.517
<i>All right.</i>

01:41:32.778 --> 01:41:35.059
Not that anyone cares what I say,

01:41:35.163 --> 01:41:38.406
but the restaurant
is at the other end of the universe.

01:42:07.354 --> 01:42:10.973
<i>So long and thanks for all the fish</i>

01:42:11.108 --> 01:42:15.188
<i>So sad that it should come to this</i>

01:42:15.321 --> 01:42:20.148
<i>We tried to warn you all but, oh, dear</i>

01:42:23.162 --> 01:42:27.196
<i>You may not share our intellect</i>

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:31.158
<i>Which might explain your disrespect</i>

01:42:31.295 --> 01:42:38.665
<i>For all the natural wonders</i>
<i>that grow around you</i>

01:42:38.769 --> 01:42:43.719
<i>So long, so long and thanks</i>
<i>for all the fish</i>

01:42:51.315 --> 01:42:55.222
<i>The world's about to be destroyed</i>

01:42:55.326 --> 01:42:59.143
<i>There's no point getting all annoyed</i>

01:42:59.247 --> 01:43:05.527
<i>Lie back and let the planet dissolve</i>

01:43:07.248 --> 01:43:11.197
<i>Despite those nets of tuna fleets</i>

01:43:11.335 --> 01:43:15.167
<i>We thought that most of you were sweet</i>

01:43:15.297 --> 01:43:22.584
<i>Especially tiny tots</i>
<i>and your pregnant women</i>

01:43:22.688 --> 01:43:26.629
<i>So long, so long,</i>
<i>so long, so long, so long</i>

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:35.766
<i>So long, so long and thanks</i>
<i>for all the fish</i>

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:42.615
Yeah.

01:43:54.044 --> 01:43:55.503
Play it.

01:43:59.091 --> 01:44:03.209
<i>So long and thanks for all the fish</i>

01:44:03.313 --> 01:44:07.211
<i>So sad that it should come to this</i>

01:44:07.315 --> 01:44:13.311
<i>We tried to warn you all but, oh, dear</i>

01:44:13.439 --> 01:44:15.768
<i>Oh, dear</i>

01:44:15.868 --> 01:44:19.136
<i>Despite those nets of tuna fleets</i>

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.234
<i>We thought that most of you were sweet</i>

01:44:23.365 --> 01:44:30.652
<i>Especially tiny tots</i>
<i>and your pregnant women</i>

01:44:30.756 --> 01:44:34.662
<i>So long, so long,</i>
<i>so long, so long, so long</i>

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:46.716
<i>So long, so long and thanks</i>
<i>for all the fish</i>

01:44:47.598 --> 01:44:50.267
<i>For all the fish</i>

01:44:53.771 --> 01:44:58.010
<i>It is, of course, well known</i>
<i>that careless talk costs lives.</i>

01:44:58.115 --> 01:45:01.433
<i>But the full scale of the problem</i>
<i>is not always appreciated.</i>

01:45:01.537 --> 01:45:04.936
<i>For instance, at the very moment</i>
<i>that Arthur Dent said,</i>

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:08.562
<i>"I wouldn't want to go anywhere</i>
<i>without my wonderful towel",</i>

01:45:08.666 --> 01:45:13.233
<i>a freak wormhole opened up in</i>
<i>the fabric of the space-time continuum</i>

01:45:13.337 --> 01:45:16.823
<i>and carried his words far,</i>
<i>far back in time,</i>

01:45:16.927 --> 01:45:20.953
<i>across almost infinite reaches of space,</i>
<i>to a distant galaxy</i>

01:45:21.057 --> 01:45:24.705
<i>where strange and warlike beings</i>
<i>were poised on the brink</i>

01:45:24.809 --> 01:45:27.288
<i>of frightful interstellar battle.</i>

01:45:27.392 --> 01:45:31.921
<i>The two opposing leaders, resplendent</i>
<i>in their black-jewelled battle shorts</i>

01:45:32.026 --> 01:45:34.057
<i>were meeting for the last time,</i>

01:45:34.228 --> 01:45:36.969
<i>when a dreadful silence fell.</i>

01:45:37.073 --> 01:45:39.012
<i>And at that very moment,</i>

01:45:39.116 --> 01:45:43.058
<i>the words "I wouldn't want to go</i>
<i>anywhere without my wonderful towel"</i>

01:45:43.237 --> 01:45:46.184
<i>drifted across the conference table.</i>

01:45:46.288 --> 01:45:48.941
<i>Unfortunately, in their native tongue,</i>

01:45:49.045 --> 01:45:52.026
<i>this was the most appalling</i>
<i>insult imaginable.</i>

01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:53.736
<i>So the opposing battle fleets</i>

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:56.445
<i>decided to settle</i>
<i>their remaining differences,</i>

01:45:56.549 --> 01:45:59.905
<i>in order to launch</i>
<i>a joint attack on our galaxy,</i>

01:46:00.009 --> 01:46:04.121
<i>now positively identified</i>
<i>as the source of the offending remark.</i>

01:46:04.226 --> 01:46:07.466
<i>For thousands of years,</i>
<i>the mighty starships tore across</i>

01:46:07.595 --> 01:46:13.005
<i>the empty wastes of space and finally</i>
<i>dived screaming onto the planet Earth,</i>

01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:17.145
<i>where, due to</i>
<i>a terrible miscalculation of scale,</i>

01:46:17.271 --> 01:46:21.697
<i>the entire battle fleet was</i>
<i>accidentally swallowed by a small dog.</i>

01:46:22.159 --> 01:46:25.734
<i>Those who study the complex</i>
<i>interplay of cause and effect</i>

01:46:25.863 --> 01:46:27.571
<i>in the history of the universe</i>

01:46:27.698 --> 01:46:31.694
<i>say that this sort of thing</i>
<i>is going on all the time.</i>
