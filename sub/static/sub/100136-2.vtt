00:17.680 --> 00:18.720
<i>I'm Alyssa.</i>

00:21.040 --> 00:22.200
<i>I'm 19.</i>

00:23.840 --> 00:26.680
<i>And I thought I already had
the shittest day of my life.</i>

00:28.440 --> 00:30.000
You look like a princess.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.560
<i>But this is actually worse.</i>

00:36.160 --> 00:38.480
<i>I got community service for what I did,</i>

00:38.560 --> 00:40.560
<i>which wasn't as bad
as going back to school.</i>

00:45.640 --> 00:48.680
<i>It's not easy,
what comes after something like that.</i>

00:54.520 --> 00:56.880
<i>It's like you become a shit celebrity.</i>

00:58.040 --> 00:59.840
<i>You become someone else.</i>

01:00.920 --> 01:02.080
<i>Even to yourself.</i>

01:09.160 --> 01:11.320
<i>But you can't go back
to who you were before.</i>

01:16.640 --> 01:19.520
<i>I think my mum found what happened to me
even worse than I did.</i>

01:20.400 --> 01:22.680
Please, Tony. Please don't leave me!

01:26.720 --> 01:28.240
I've kicked Tony out.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.520
<i>She hadn't.</i>

01:35.400 --> 01:37.600
<i>Mum went genuinely a bit mad after that.</i>

01:38.400 --> 01:41.240
<i>She started talking about herself
in the third person.</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:44.400
I think Gwen needs a nap.

01:44.760 --> 01:45.760
Okay.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.720
<i>It was too much, us staying there.</i>

01:51.800 --> 01:54.760
<i>In that house, that town.</i>

01:57.720 --> 01:59.560
<i>So we took the twins and left.</i>

02:02.640 --> 02:05.640
<i>It meant missing the end of school,
but mum said that was okay.</i>

02:05.720 --> 02:07.160
You can finish it later.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.760
Or get a job.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.280
Or marry someone rich.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.720
Sorry.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.080
<i>We went to live with my aunt, Leigh,</i>

02:30.160 --> 02:31.560
<i>Mum's half-sister.</i>

02:34.440 --> 02:36.720
<i>She runs a cafe,
and she doesn't trust deodorant</i>

02:36.800 --> 02:38.200
<i>because of breast cancer.</i>

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
<i>I like her.</i>

02:43.200 --> 02:46.720
<i>She said we could stay at her place
for as long as we wanted.</i>

02:49.240 --> 02:51.080
<i>We've been here over a year now.</i>

02:52.760 --> 02:54.520
<i>I don't think she meant that long.</i>

02:55.840 --> 02:58.440
<i>It's good that Mum has someone else
to talk to.</i>

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
<i>Good for me.</i>

03:03.720 --> 03:05.920
<i>It makes it easier for me to be okay.</i>

03:15.400 --> 03:17.480
<i>And actually, I am okay.</i>

03:18.560 --> 03:20.480
<i>I don't really feel anything any more.</i>

03:22.360 --> 03:24.000
<i>It's good, not feeling.</i>

03:25.000 --> 03:26.680
<i>It's like a superpower.</i>

03:29.560 --> 03:30.840
<i>Leigh gave me a job.</i>

03:31.800 --> 03:34.040
<i>Mainly, so that I had something to do,
I think.</i>

03:34.120 --> 03:36.240
<i>This is what you might call irony.</i>

03:36.720 --> 03:40.320
See if Marvin can make
a banana split for me, you fucking cu...

03:40.920 --> 03:42.000
What can I get you?

03:42.520 --> 03:43.560
Is that your real name?

03:43.640 --> 03:44.920
You know it is.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.000
<i>Billy is Leigh's foster son.</i>

03:47.600 --> 03:48.600
It's shit.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.080
<i>He's a sweet kid.</i>

03:50.600 --> 03:51.600
Okay.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.360
<i>Work's boring.</i>

03:58.840 --> 04:00.840
<i>But I did meet Todd there.</i>

04:01.920 --> 04:02.920
Hiya.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.160
<i>He teaches canoeing to kids,</i>

04:05.240 --> 04:06.960
<i>and he has quite strong opinions.</i>

04:07.720 --> 04:08.720
You know Finland?

04:09.520 --> 04:11.120
It doesn't actually exist.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.640
It's a fabricated land mass
made up by the Russians in the Cold War.

04:15.960 --> 04:16.960
Right.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.520
Is this a date?

04:22.480 --> 04:23.480
Yeah.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.560
Cool.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.120
<i>He's kind of like a dog.</i>

04:31.200 --> 04:32.360
<i>In a good way.</i>

04:33.560 --> 04:35.600
<i>He's also a really good kisser.</i>

04:38.960 --> 04:40.920
My aunt's got a cabin by the lake.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
Cool.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.720
<i>Sex is actually all right, it turns out.</i>

04:49.320 --> 04:50.800
<i>It's not such a big deal.</i>

04:53.600 --> 04:55.240
<i>I told him about everything.</i>

04:59.080 --> 05:00.080
Shit.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.640
Yeah.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.320
Do you like chicken fajitas?

05:14.160 --> 05:15.200
<i>He gets it.</i>

05:20.640 --> 05:22.200
Do you wanna get married?

05:26.640 --> 05:28.160
Yeah, fuck it, why not?

05:28.880 --> 05:30.600
<i>Exactly, fuck it.</i>

05:39.240 --> 05:41.160
<i>Mum's pretty excited about the wedding.</i>

05:42.640 --> 05:45.160
<i>She's really thrown herself
into the whole thing.</i>

05:45.640 --> 05:47.920
- Why are we doing this again?
- What, love?

05:48.920 --> 05:51.240
The wedding is tomorrow, it fits.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.440
It fit fine before.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.120
Now...

05:56.880 --> 05:58.240
it's perfect.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.880
<i>Getting married young
is one of the most renegade things</i>

06:01.960 --> 06:03.280
<i>you can do these days.</i>

06:04.400 --> 06:06.800
<i>Mum's using Tony's divorce money
to pay for it,</i>

06:06.880 --> 06:08.880
<i>which is also pretty maverick.</i>

06:09.840 --> 06:10.840
<i>And I'm happy.</i>

06:11.520 --> 06:14.320

07:18.800 --> 07:21.280
- What?
- I said, "Is there service included?"

07:22.560 --> 07:24.040
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.040
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.200
Do you know whose car that is?

07:36.920 --> 07:38.600
No. Why?

07:39.280 --> 07:40.280
Dunno.

- Okay.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.840
Oi!

08:47.560 --> 08:48.560

08:51.520 --> 08:52.720

09:28.360 --> 09:29.760

<i>I was under 24-hour police surveillance</i>

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280

09:47.240 --> 09:48.240
No.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.400
Do you, uh... Do you mind?

09:51.880 --> 09:52.880
No.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.800

10:04.920 --> 10:07.280
<i>Alyssa and I weren't allowed

10:08.040 --> 10:09.040
<i>Not at all.</i>

10:10.200 --> 10:11.720
<i>But I thought about her all the time.</i>

10:19.240 --> 10:20.320
Hello, James.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.440
I've got some results to discuss with you.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.560
Would you like your dad?

10:24.640 --> 10:27.240
<i>My dad's response to me being shot
was to eat or cry.</i>

10:28.800 --> 10:30.400
<i>Quite often at the same time.</i>

10:30.480 --> 10:31.600
Sorry, James.

10:34.720 --> 10:35.960
No, that's all right.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.760
Fine.

10:40.680 --> 10:41.680
Well...

10:42.240 --> 10:44.040
as you know, James, the information...

10:44.680 --> 10:46.840
<i>The bullet had done quite a lot of damage.</i>

10:47.640 --> 10:49.320
<i>She talked about my injuries,</i>

10:50.200 --> 10:51.720
<i>about complications.</i>

10:52.800 --> 10:54.280
<i>And things taking time.</i>

10:55.640 --> 10:56.880
<i>And long roads ahead.</i>

10:57.400 --> 10:58.840
But in many ways,

10:59.240 --> 11:01.880
James, you have been extremely lucky.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.600
<i>I didn't feel lucky.</i>

11:04.200 --> 11:05.200
Okay.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.880
<i>I felt like I was being punished.</i>

11:11.320 --> 11:12.720
<i>And maybe I deserved it.</i>

11:17.080 --> 11:18.080
James?

11:18.840 --> 11:20.880
<i>I'd never met Alyssa's mum before.</i>

11:21.360 --> 11:23.040
<i>At first, she seemed quite nice.</i>

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
How are you?

11:25.720 --> 11:26.720
I'm okay.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.840
- Would you like a yogurt?
- No. Thank you.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.800
- How's Alyssa?
- You need to break up with her.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.080
- What?
- The thing is, it's your fault, isn't it?

11:40.160 --> 11:42.760
What happened.
I'm sure you didn't mean it, but...

11:43.200 --> 11:44.880
you've ruined her life.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.240
You've ruined everything.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.240
Sorry.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.720
What can you offer her?

11:50.680 --> 11:52.480
Like... this?

11:52.560 --> 11:53.600
No offense.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.000
<i>It was quite hard not to take offense.</i>

11:56.080 --> 11:58.160
Are you going to be able to walk again?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.360
I think so.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.320
And they say you're going to prison.
Is that right?

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
I dunno.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Probably.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.920
If you loved her, you'd let her go.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.200
It's like that song.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.520
<i>I didn't know the song
she was talking about.</i>

12:15.640 --> 12:17.440
<i>But I had a feeling she might be right.</i>

12:17.520 --> 12:19.360
I thought you could write her a letter.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.240
I don't want to.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.440
Well, she needs to move on,
and you're no good for her.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.640
I'm sorry.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.840
But that's the truth.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.320
<i>The truth was something
I'd been trying to ignore.</i>

12:44.520 --> 12:45.920
The harsher the better.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.600
You know how stubborn she is.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.680
I've got a stamp.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.640
<i>I had a feeling
that Alyssa got the letter.</i>

13:04.840 --> 13:06.600
<i>Because I never heard from her again.</i>

13:10.520 --> 13:13.520
<i>♪ I'm sitting here ♪</i>

13:14.680 --> 13:18.400
<i>♪ And she's sitting there ♪</i>

13:19.480 --> 13:21.600

13:21.680 --> 13:24.760
<i>On the upside,
after a number of operations,</i>

13:25.400 --> 13:27.520
<i>I was able
to start learning to walk again.</i>

13:34.320 --> 13:36.240
<i>And I didn't go to prison after all.</i>

13:36.320 --> 13:37.320
Get in!

13:37.400 --> 13:39.640
<i>The jury agreed
I was acting in defence of another</i>

13:39.720 --> 13:41.400
<i>and found me not guilty of murder.</i>

13:41.480 --> 13:43.200
<i>The videotape definitely helped.</i>

13:43.760 --> 13:44.760
<i>Stay still!</i>

13:44.800 --> 13:46.720
<i>But I was given a suspended sentence</i>

13:46.800 --> 13:48.320
<i>for various other misdemeanours.</i>

13:50.320 --> 13:52.720
<i>I wanted to give my dad some money
for his new car.</i>

13:54.160 --> 13:55.280
<i>But he wouldn't let me.</i>

13:56.120 --> 13:59.080
<i>It's funny, the way people lie to be kind.</i>

13:59.640 --> 14:01.520
I think this is actually nicer to drive.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.200
<i>After I nearly died,</i>

14:04.280 --> 14:06.600
<i>Dad signed up

14:09.440 --> 14:11.680
<i>He started talking about his feelings.</i>

14:12.640 --> 14:14.800
I really value us spending time together.

14:16.840 --> 14:17.920
Yeah.

14:19.840 --> 14:20.920
I'm proud of you.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.560
Thank you.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.560
I think we should do
more activities together.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.320
Okay.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.080
<i>Bowling did seem slightly ambitious,</i>

14:34.560 --> 14:37.280

14:37.360 --> 14:39.440
This is brilliant, innit?

14:44.720 --> 14:45.800
Yeah!

14:45.880 --> 14:48.320
I did it!

14:48.400 --> 14:51.320
