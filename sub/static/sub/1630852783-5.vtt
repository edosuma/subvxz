of you anywhere.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.359

be photographers at the launch?

05:08.120 --> 05:10.040
Just let me get over it.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.679
Erm, do you want me to do
the guest list for the launch?

to Nish. Yeah, that would be good.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.359

from his office.

sort of runs itself now

for the launch? It'll be great.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.919
Yeah.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.480
I just hope Elliot manages
to enjoy himself.

05:56.480 --> 06:01.039

quite difficult.

about Chloe, don't you?

06:21.040 --> 06:22.920
Really? Sorry.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.759
Sorry.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.519
Erm, I… I guess it's…

06:29.520 --> 06:33.119
It's just been such a trauma
for Elliot. I want to support him.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.360
Well, you scared him
the other night.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.120
Disappearing like that.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.280

talking about five or six times

Nish talks a lot about her, right?

10:30.040 --> 10:31.279
Yeah.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.720
I never got why he hated her
so much.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.280
Yeah… Yeah.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.479
That's so weird.
What was THAT about?

10:42.480 --> 10:44.440
He's got oblique energy.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.919
He's got what?

10:46.920 --> 10:49.039
He's always angry
at the wrong thing.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.599
Maybe it's because he's terrified
that at any point

10:51.600 --> 10:53.399
he's going to be thrown
off the ride.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.439
I should get back in.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.919
Who are you here with?
Just some friends.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.760
Did Nish ever mention anything
about some money?

11:01.760 --> 11:04.039
No. Or a chocolate box?

11:04.040 --> 11:06.839
What? I just heard there was
something weird

11:06.840 --> 11:09.679
about the chocolates that Chloe
brought Elliot that night.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.599
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.199

11:13.200 --> 11:15.279

You didn't say anything
this morning.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.279
No… No. Sorry, I forgot.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.519
Erm, where are you?

16:15.520 --> 16:17.039
I'm at home.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.599
I was waiting,
getting worried about you. OK.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.519

in half an hour.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.760

you were at Gardiner Park.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.040

I'll be back soon.

you were working late tonight.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.759

17:07.760 --> 17:09.839

It's Chloe's diary.

There's lots in there about you.

I need to ask you some questions.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.839
Why?

20:28.840 --> 20:31.520
You were picking her up
from the swimming pool.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.280
And the last time was
a few days before she died.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.479

these questions?

20:40.480 --> 20:42.519

20:42.520 --> 20:44.520
Do you want the diary or not?

20:49.760 --> 20:52.319
Were you blackmailing her?

20:52.320 --> 20:55.479
Are you fucking crazy?!
I'm not talking to you. Wait.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.120
I knew Chloe.

21:04.040 --> 21:08.520
I met her a few months before
she died. At the pool, actually.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.040
I fucking knew I remembered you.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.760
Yeah. We got on very quickly.

21:18.760 --> 21:22.040
She was a good person and I think
she was in some kind of trouble.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.920
Do you recognise this?

21:29.760 --> 21:31.359
What is it?

21:31.360 --> 21:34.039
She gave it to me a few days
before she died.

21:34.040 --> 21:37.039
She told me to hold on to it
until she came and asked for it.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.759
Don't you know what it's for?

21:38.760 --> 21:41.279
No. That's what I'm trying

22:14.520 --> 22:16.520
Yeah, I guess we…

22:18.040 --> 22:20.280
We started hanging out…

22:21.520 --> 22:23.120
…a lot…

22:24.120 --> 22:26.119
…in her last few weeks.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.040
What did you do?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.519
I don't know. She'd…

22:31.520 --> 22:33.759
She'd come over, we'd hang out.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.039
She'd…

22:35.040 --> 22:38.039

To go where?

22:38.040 --> 22:40.039
I don't know.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.359
Why… Why didn't she use her own?

22:42.360 --> 22:44.640
Because she didn't have one.

22:46.520 --> 22:50.040
The medication she was on made
her drowsy so it wasn't safe.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.680

Yeah, saying? Saying…

23:42.520 --> 23:46.279
She wanted to borrow my car again
and I was supposed to give her

23:46.280 --> 23:49.039
my keys at Elliot's charity thing.

Sasha?! Erm… Erm…

43:41.760 --> 43:45.280
From the beginning,
I've found her very intimidating.

43:47.520 --> 43:51.520
And she was this incredibly
important woman in your life.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.439

her own worst enemy.

I really…tried to help her.

Don't get me wrong,
I'm not saying I was blameless.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.760
I let things slip.

45:12.760 --> 45:15.040
But she wouldn't accept my help.

45:18.040 --> 45:21.039
Sometimes I think…

45:21.040 --> 45:24.040
…she enjoyed proving me wrong.
