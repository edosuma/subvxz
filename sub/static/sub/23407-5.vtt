10:13.694 --> 10:14.846
Didn't happen that fast.

10:14.901 --> 10:17.689
Baby, in my office.

10:18.172 --> 10:20.268
Just sit your ass in the office, okay?

10:21.074 --> 10:22.664
Come on to the office, Ella.

10:23.277 --> 10:24.728
Thank you for taking them.

10:25.245 --> 10:26.386
You're welcome.

10:33.987 --> 10:35.234
Not coming?

10:37.090 --> 10:39.078
And giving them a place to stay.

10:39.560 --> 10:43.246
Don't you worry about them.
Don't worry about them.

10:43.664 --> 10:45.891
No, she needs to worry about them.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.443
Worry about them.

10:50.370 --> 10:51.970
Will you come with me to turn myself in?

10:51.972 --> 10:53.002
Yes.

10:53.732 --> 10:55.353
She gonna take the kids with her?

10:56.645 --> 10:58.406
They've got little
handcuffs. I've seen them.

11:00.595 --> 11:02.562
I can't believe it. I hope he's okay.

11:02.563 --> 11:04.611
No. No. No. Well, if he's not,

11:04.912 --> 11:06.798
this could be really bad.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.568
- I know.
- I wish you'd come to me.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.029
How could I?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.971
You always talk about how nice he was

11:12.973 --> 11:15.073
and how his father has
done so many great things

11:15.075 --> 11:17.676
for you at the church and at the bank.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.550
Oh, baby. You really think
that I wouldn't have helped you?

11:21.176 --> 11:23.549
I don't think that's right, not at all.

11:23.854 --> 11:24.940
That's not right.

11:27.049 --> 11:28.580
That's not right at all.

11:33.130 --> 11:35.703
So I guess we should call the police.

11:35.866 --> 11:37.460
Yeah. I'll go call them.

11:37.901 --> 11:39.100
Curtis, where is the office?

11:39.102 --> 11:40.971
Oh, now you want to go to the office?

11:42.272 --> 11:43.587
This is the worst.

11:56.171 --> 11:57.320
Come on.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.064
I can't believe this.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.627
Lord, have mercy.

12:04.107 --> 12:06.237
Can't believe it either.
I can't believe it either.

12:06.910 --> 12:08.922
I hate that this has happened.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.653
- You know what I hate?
- What?

12:11.848 --> 12:13.997
That you told her we'd keep them kids.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.485
- Curtis...
- Baby, it's all right.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.387
It's all right. I know
you just told her that

12:19.389 --> 12:21.155
so she could go on and turn herself in,

12:21.157 --> 12:22.397
so it's all right.

12:22.692 --> 12:25.386
No, that's not why I told her that.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.543
It's all right. It's all right.

12:29.129 --> 12:31.945
I know you just told her that
so she'd get out the place.

12:32.735 --> 12:34.062
So it's all right.

12:34.846 --> 12:37.615
Nope. Nope.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.746
Then why the hell did you tell her that?

12:42.129 --> 12:45.428
Because, Curtis, we are taking those kids.

12:46.249 --> 12:48.493
- Ella.
- What?

12:49.285 --> 12:51.976
Baby, we can't take those kids.

12:52.222 --> 12:53.688
We can't take those kids.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.871
Why can't we take those kids, Curtis?

12:56.326 --> 12:58.593
We need to talk about this, Ella.

12:58.595 --> 13:00.783
What do we have to talk about?

13:01.373 --> 13:03.208
Ella, you are old.

13:07.094 --> 13:08.369
Excuse me?

13:09.129 --> 13:10.834
Baby, you can't raise...

13:11.065 --> 13:13.231
You can't raise no more kids, Ella.

13:16.275 --> 13:17.302
There is a reason.

13:17.304 --> 13:18.584
Ella, don't say nothing.

13:19.373 --> 13:20.596
Listen to me.

13:21.809 --> 13:24.543
There is a reason that God made it

13:24.545 --> 13:27.460
so women stop having
babies after a certain age.

13:27.581 --> 13:30.169
I'm just saying. That's the Bible.

13:30.984 --> 13:34.228
I know you're not about
to try to quote the Bible.

13:36.924 --> 13:38.176
Watch and listen.

13:40.473 --> 13:42.395
- Will you excuse me?
- And you God said...

13:43.122 --> 13:44.206
Will you excuse...

13:44.206 --> 13:47.442
...to Sarah in 2 Jericho.

13:49.127 --> 13:50.205
Sarah?

13:50.995 --> 13:52.232
You've read it.

13:53.698 --> 13:56.212
You remember when God,when God, uh...

13:56.845 --> 13:57.831
God told her

13:57.856 --> 14:00.626
that she was gonna conceive, huh,

14:01.237 --> 14:03.986
and she laughed in his face?

14:04.054 --> 14:05.304
You remember that?

14:06.748 --> 14:08.414
That's what you need to be doing, Ella.

14:08.416 --> 14:10.751
You need to be laughing in God's face.

14:12.253 --> 14:14.151
You've got to apply the word, Ella.

14:14.424 --> 14:15.690
Apply it.

14:16.224 --> 14:18.083
Curtis, really?

14:19.627 --> 14:20.706
Really?

14:21.612 --> 14:23.651
Sarah conceived anyway

14:24.946 --> 14:27.007
in her old age.

14:27.212 --> 14:29.012
You got to read it.

14:31.216 --> 14:33.064
Baby, that's the old testament.

14:34.119 --> 14:35.859
Don't nobody even read that anymore.

14:36.055 --> 14:37.287
Curtis.

14:37.289 --> 14:39.890
Baby, we can't take on no more kids, baby.

14:39.892 --> 14:42.559
Curtis, listen. Hush. Okay?

14:42.561 --> 14:43.769
Just hush.

[GRUNTS]

14:47.286 --> 14:49.947
Hi. I need the police, please.

14:50.285 --> 14:51.517
Baby, did you see that boy?

14:51.519 --> 14:52.821
Non-emergency.

14:54.055 --> 14:55.893
Did you see that boy, Ella?

14:57.192 --> 14:59.444
Curtis, this woman may be going to jail.

15:00.395 --> 15:01.841
Then I would be right.

15:03.665 --> 15:06.232
Did you see that boy and how he acts, Ella?

15:06.234 --> 15:07.633
Just like you.

15:09.085 --> 15:10.703
I will hurt him.

15:12.941 --> 15:14.972
Yes, I said non-emergency.

15:16.311 --> 15:17.520
Yes, we...

15:20.548 --> 15:21.566
Oh.

15:21.951 --> 15:23.335
I will hurt him.

15:25.186 --> 15:27.119
All he needs is a stable home

15:27.121 --> 15:28.987
and someone to show him the way.

15:30.509 --> 15:32.127
I can't do that.

15:33.312 --> 15:35.588
I will lead him down the wrong path

15:36.566 --> 15:38.194
for his namesake.

15:41.434 --> 15:44.900
Yes, I need... yes. We
need the police, please.

Curtis, what's the address?

I ain't telling you.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.280
Oh, so you've got it?

15:58.184 --> 15:59.517
This thing works?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.086
Yes. Yes, sir.

16:02.088 --> 16:03.830
We have someone here

16:03.855 --> 16:06.641
who wants to turn themself in.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.833
I'm not sure for what.

16:11.946 --> 16:13.017
Yes.

16:14.166 --> 16:15.717
Well, yes. Yes.

16:16.468 --> 16:18.899
Man, can you just send
the police on over here?

16:20.334 --> 16:22.267
And tell them send one for me, too.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.617
Yes. Thank you.

16:27.530 --> 16:28.635
Eesh.

16:29.725 --> 16:30.881
Why'd you hang up?

16:30.883 --> 16:32.748
What do you need the police for?

16:33.467 --> 16:35.646
To keep me from dropping all them kids.

16:39.653 --> 16:42.000
Well, they're coming home with us.

16:43.251 --> 16:45.120
Ella, are you crazy?

16:45.913 --> 16:47.145
Come on, baby.

16:47.435 --> 16:51.251
Look, Ella, I'm tired of
you disrespecting my wishes.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.105
I done had it.

16:53.107 --> 16:55.254
Curtis, is this coming from

16:55.279 --> 16:57.878
the man who moved us to Florida

16:57.879 --> 16:59.645
without even telling me about it?

17:01.460 --> 17:03.514
Boy, you gonna always
bring that up, ain't you?

17:04.055 --> 17:05.644
For as long as we live here.

17:06.988 --> 17:09.606
Baby, but you like it here.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.758

- What?

17:12.760 --> 17:14.926
Baby, this is a good move.

17:15.496 --> 17:17.443
This was a good investment.

17:22.699 --> 17:24.260
What about it?

You see?

17:32.917 --> 17:34.203
See, baby?

17:35.183 --> 17:36.945
Baby, I can fix the door.

17:38.453 --> 17:40.175
Can't fix them kids.

Curtis, all those kids...
Yes, we can fix those kids.

- Hey. Where's Nyla?
- Hey. Did you call them?

18:58.811 --> 19:01.278
Yes. They're on their way. Where's Nyla?

19:01.280 --> 19:03.016
She went to check on her kids.

19:03.449 --> 19:04.548
Okay.

I'm not gonna be all right.

19:19.095 --> 19:20.506
What's he talking about?

19:20.596 --> 19:24.263
Nyla asked us to take her
kids if she goes to jail.

19:24.667 --> 19:27.568
- And you said yes?
- Yes.

19:42.778 --> 19:43.917
Heck, no.
