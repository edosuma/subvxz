00:26.068 --> 00:27.819
<i>My children...</i>

00:27.819 --> 00:29.905
<i>from the very beginning...</i>

00:29.905 --> 00:34.284
<i>it was the children
who gave me my power.</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:37.246
<i>The Springwood Slasher...</i>

00:37.246 --> 00:39.164
<i>that's what they called me.</i>

01:02.187 --> 01:05.440
<i>My reign of terror
was legendary.</i>

01:05.566 --> 01:09.570
<i>Dozens of children
would fall by my blades.</i>

01:12.823 --> 01:16.660
<i>Then the parents of Springwood
came for me...</i>

01:22.124 --> 01:26.253
<i>taking justice
into their own hands.</i>

01:28.255 --> 01:32.259
<i>When I was alive, I might
have been a little naughty...</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:34.011
<i>but after they killed me,</i>

01:34.052 --> 01:37.347
<i>I became something much,
much worse--</i>

01:37.347 --> 01:40.392
<i>the stuff nightmares
are made of.</i>

01:41.518 --> 01:42.853
<i>The children
still feared me...</i>

01:42.978 --> 01:46.857
<i>and their fear gave me the power
to invade their dreams.</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:51.111
<i>And that's when the fun
really began!</i>

01:54.323 --> 01:59.494
<i>Until they figured out
a way to forget about me...</i>

01:59.494 --> 02:02.456
<i>to erase me completely!</i>

02:02.456 --> 02:04.208
<i>Being dead wasn't a problem.</i>

02:04.208 --> 02:07.294
<i>But being forgotten--
now, that's a bitch!</i>

02:11.048 --> 02:12.341
It's only a dream!

02:12.466 --> 02:13.800
Die, motherfucker!

02:13.842 --> 02:17.012
<i>I can't come back
if nobody remembers me!</i>

02:17.012 --> 02:21.141
<i>I can't come back
if nobody's afraid!</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:28.774
<i>I had to search the bowels of hell...</i>

02:28.774 --> 02:31.568
<i>but I found someone...</i>

02:31.568 --> 02:35.197
<i>someone who'll make 'em remember.</i>

02:35.197 --> 02:39.701
<i>He may get the blood,
but I'll get the glory.</i>

02:39.701 --> 02:43.997
<i>And that fear is my ticket home.</i>

02:45.374 --> 02:46.416
Mike?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.045
Is that you?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.425
All right, fuck you, then.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.468
I'm heading in.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.734
Mike?

03:12.776 --> 03:14.736
Come on, it's not funny anymore.

04:43.033 --> 04:43.992
No!

04:47.871 --> 04:49.164
<i>Jason.</i>

04:54.670 --> 04:58.423
<i>I should've been watching
them, not drinking...</i>

04:58.423 --> 05:00.384
<i>not meeting a boy
at the lake.</i>

05:01.969 --> 05:03.971
<i>I deserve to be punished.</i>

05:04.012 --> 05:06.431
<i>We all deserved
to be punished.</i>

05:06.431 --> 05:08.976
<i>Jason.</i>

05:10.394 --> 05:12.938
My special, special boy.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.191
Do you know what
your gift is?

05:16.275 --> 05:17.734
No matter what they do to you...

05:17.776 --> 05:19.862
you cannot die.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.281
You can never die.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.617
You've just been
sleeping, honey.

05:25.659 --> 05:30.581
But now the time
has come to wake up.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.585
Mommy has something
she wants you to do.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.714
<i>I need you to go
to Elm Street.</i>

05:38.714 --> 05:43.260
<i>The children have been
very bad on Elm Street.</i>

05:43.260 --> 05:45.846
<i>Rise up, Jason!</i>

05:45.846 --> 05:49.016
<i>Your work isn't finished!</i>

05:49.016 --> 05:52.769
<i>Hear my voice and live again!</i>

06:02.237 --> 06:05.574
Make them remember me, Jason.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.535
Make them remember
what fear tastes like.

06:10.871 --> 06:15.626
I've been away from my children
for far too long.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.042
Marry, fuck, or kill?
Your choices are--

06:57.042 --> 06:58.585
your choices
are the Three Stooges.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.670
Go, Kia.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.047
Oh, God...

07:02.089 --> 07:05.050
Which one had
the super-bad toupee hair?

07:05.050 --> 07:07.052
Harry, Mar--

07:07.135 --> 07:08.887
No! No, no, no.
It was Moe.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.598
Either one, I'd kill him.

07:11.682 --> 07:12.724
OK, who'd you fuck, then?

07:12.724 --> 07:13.976
This is stupid, y'all.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.686
Come on. Come on.

07:15.727 --> 07:16.895
Oh, God. Whatever, look.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.355
I'd fuck the bald guy,
and I'd marry Larry.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.482
Jesus. Is this what
we're doing all night?

07:20.482 --> 07:22.776
'Cause, y'all,
this is really stank.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.945
Hey! Gibb, what are you doing?

07:25.028 --> 07:25.988
I thought you were gonna quit.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.489
I only smoke when I drink now.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.074
But you're always drinking.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.701
Yeah, well, I'll work
on that next.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.203
Hey, OK.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.121
I got another one.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.832
Fred, Scooby, or Shaggy?

07:36.832 --> 07:39.168
Oh! I'm not answering that
and neither is she.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.837
Do you guys think
I should get a nose job?

07:41.879 --> 07:43.088
Oh, my God.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.632
Oh, please, Kia, what you need
is a lobotomy.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.137
I think I'm gonna
get some candles.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.640
I'm gonna get some beer.
Do you guys want anything?

07:55.726 --> 07:57.477
Are you sure you
should be driving?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.146
I'm so under the limit, Lori.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.523
Surprise.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.150
Oh, Trey.
You answered my prayers.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.193
Thank you.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.111
Whoa, babe!

08:06.111 --> 08:07.154
What'd I tell you
about kissing me...

08:07.237 --> 08:08.447
after you've smoked, huh?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.032
Lighten up.
They're menthols.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.284
Yeah. I brought Blake.
Where's Linda?

08:12.326 --> 08:13.702
It's Lori.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.038
This is her house,
so don't be a total cocksmith.

08:16.038 --> 08:16.997
Whatever.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.586
Where are the ladies?

08:22.586 --> 08:24.254
Relax, they'll be here.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.672
I'm relaxed, man.
I'm just wet.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.549
Did you know they
were coming over?

08:27.549 --> 08:29.843
Listen, you gotta be quiet.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.095
Hey, we knew you were be here
all alone this weekend.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.057
Blake's cute.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.808
He's not my type.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.186
Oh! Who is? No one's
ever gonna live up...

08:39.186 --> 08:42.105
to the fuzzy memory
of your first love, Lori.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.857
You were fucking fourteen,
so get over it.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.359
Yeah, I know
we were young...

08:45.442 --> 08:47.361
but what Will and l
had was real.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.363
Well, correct me if I'm wrong...

08:49.363 --> 08:51.907
but didn't Mr. Real
just drop-kick your ass...

08:51.990 --> 08:53.742
without so much
as a good-bye handshake?

08:53.825 --> 08:57.329
He ever even call or maybe even
write to you after he moved?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.664
Send you an e-mail?

08:58.664 --> 08:59.915
No.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.000
You see my point?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.044
It's time to leave
the convent, Lori.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.796
You need to meet a guy.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.107
Hey, Lori...

09:25.148 --> 09:28.277
I like the...
flow of your place.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.195
Got good feng shui.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.030
Yeah.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.707
You know about feng shui?

09:41.707 --> 09:43.041
Oh, oh!

09:43.041 --> 09:44.042
Oh, you should see her bedroom!

09:44.042 --> 09:46.753
-Hmm?
-Great flow in there.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.381
Lori, why don't you go upstairs
and show Blake your feng shui?

09:49.381 --> 09:50.632
Shut up!

09:52.885 --> 09:54.511
I got a kink in my neck.

09:54.511 --> 09:58.015
Come on.
You can massage it out for me.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.310
I think I need
a few more drinks...

10:01.310 --> 10:03.437
before there'll be
any massaging.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.315
What do you see in him?

10:06.398 --> 10:09.193
I don't know,
but he has a cute ass.

10:09.193 --> 10:12.487
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.745
So, Lori...

10:19.745 --> 10:21.663
am I gonna get that
grand tour or what?

10:21.747 --> 10:23.916
Yeah.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.501
You know, why don't you
start in the kitchen...

10:25.501 --> 10:26.585
and get us some beers?

10:26.585 --> 10:28.003
Cool.

10:31.882 --> 10:34.134
Oh, my God, Kia,
he is a total idiot.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.093
Get him out of here.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.346
Oh, Lori, come on,
give him a chance.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.472
I don't like him.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.349
You know what?
You don't like anybody.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.059
I mean, Lori, you've
barely gone out since--

10:42.142 --> 10:44.144
Since what?
Since my mom died?

10:44.186 --> 10:45.812
Yeah, well, you know what?
My dad needs me.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.689
So I can't just go out
with guys all the time...

10:47.814 --> 10:50.984
and if I did, it would not be
with somebody like Blake.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.859
Yeah, fuck me, baby!

11:45.747 --> 11:48.041
Your back door was open.

11:48.167 --> 11:49.209
I closed it.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.544
Mmm.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.840
Babe, you know I don't like
to be touched after, OK?

11:54.965 --> 11:57.509
Fine. I'll go have
a shower then.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.555
Good.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.891
Your hair smells like
menthols, anyway.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.559
Asshole.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.865
Trey!

13:01.907 --> 13:04.660
What the hell are you doing?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.555
Help us! Help us!

13:24.638 --> 13:27.266
Oh, my God!

13:27.266 --> 13:29.434
Over here!

13:29.434 --> 13:31.270
Please help us!

13:31.270 --> 13:32.229
Help us!

13:32.229 --> 13:33.522
You kids need
some assistance?

13:33.564 --> 13:35.566
What the fuck
do you think?!

13:35.649 --> 13:37.401
We need to lock this down now.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.902
Keep it contained, you hear me?

13:38.902 --> 13:40.487
Killed in bed.

13:40.529 --> 13:43.073
Jesus.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.450
It's even the same damn house.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.910
1428 Elm.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.787
It's gotta be him, right?

13:48.787 --> 13:50.289
It's gotta be
Freddy Krueger.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.206
Hey! Don't even say...

13:51.331 --> 13:52.207
that son of a bitch's
name out loud.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.251
Let's just keep it together.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.753
We've been through too much
to let this thing spread now.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.172
Take all the kids
down to the station.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.715
Keep them separate.
Do it now.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.049
Yes, sir.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.384
We'll be in touch.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.261
Thank you.
Let's go home.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.267
So?

14:10.267 --> 14:11.476
She doesn't know anything.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.854
None of them do.

14:13.854 --> 14:14.980
I'm pretty sure we're good.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.982
Pretty sure?
You better make damn sure...

14:16.982 --> 14:18.066
none of those kids
knows anything...

14:18.192 --> 14:20.402
or I'll send your ass up
to Westin Hills with them.

14:20.485 --> 14:21.778
Knows what?
What do you mean?

14:21.862 --> 14:23.655
Good work there tonight, Stubbs.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.657
Right place, right time.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.618
But we'll take it
from here, all right?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.127
Your father's on his way.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.337
Do they know who did this?

14:38.337 --> 14:40.339
No, not yet.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.423
But I thought I heard...

14:41.423 --> 14:43.133
one of the officers
mention a name.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.635
You know, to tell
you the truth, Lori...

14:44.718 --> 14:46.762
I--I just moved here
about a month ago...

14:46.762 --> 14:49.139
but if they have a suspect,
I'd be the first to know.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.891
But they asked me all these
really weird questions...

14:50.891 --> 14:52.142
Iike about my dreams--

15:01.443 --> 15:03.028
What was the name?

15:04.613 --> 15:06.532
What was the name?

15:11.495 --> 15:13.080
Freddy.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.516
Hello?

16:22.232 --> 16:24.151
Are you OK?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.699
His name is Freddy Krueger...

16:30.782 --> 16:36.288
and he loves children,
especially little girls.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.832
Freddy's coming back.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.376
Soon he'll be strong enough.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.588
It's OK to be afraid.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.590
We were all afraid.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.052
Warn your friends.
Warn everyone.

16:59.478 --> 17:03.774
<i>One, two, Freddy's
coming for you</i>

17:03.899 --> 17:07.444
<i>Three, four,
better lock the door</i>

17:07.444 --> 17:11.656
<i>Five, six, grab a crucifix</i>

17:11.698 --> 17:15.368
<i>Seven, eight,
try to stay up late</i>

17:15.368 --> 17:19.289
<i>Nine, ten, never sleep again</i>

17:19.373 --> 17:23.669
<i>One, two, Freddy's
coming for you...</i>

17:30.551 --> 17:33.929
Blake, we have to talk.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.977
What the hell were you
doing over there?

17:39.977 --> 17:42.271
You were supposed to be
watching your sister.

17:42.271 --> 17:44.773
Were you drinking?

17:44.773 --> 17:47.651
My best friend was
just killed, Dad!

17:47.651 --> 17:51.196
So how about giving me
some fucking space?

17:52.948 --> 17:54.992
You watch yourself, boy.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.756
I'm gonna get him for you, Trey.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.925
Cop let it slip.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.510
It was somebody named Freddy.

18:13.552 --> 18:16.471
I'm gonna take him out
myself, Trey.

18:16.471 --> 18:19.683
I swear to God.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.574
Who is that?

18:35.574 --> 18:38.243
Someone there?

18:47.211 --> 18:48.337
Jesus.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.348
I'm OK. I'm all right.

19:03.602 --> 19:05.854
Not strong enough yet.

19:05.854 --> 19:09.191
Well, I will be soon enough.

19:09.191 --> 19:12.402
Until then...

19:12.402 --> 19:15.489
I'll let Jason have some fun.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.499
Dad?

19:49.690 --> 19:53.151
Hypnocil.
What does this shit do, anyway?

19:53.151 --> 19:54.736
How come we all
have to take it?

19:54.736 --> 19:58.365
It keeps you nice and docile
while I kick your little ass.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.203
I'm fine with that.

20:04.955 --> 20:08.542
<i>We interrupt this program
for a special report.</i>

20:08.542 --> 20:09.543
<i>After tonight's murder...</i>

20:09.543 --> 20:11.295
<i>in this neighborhood
of Springwood...</i>

20:11.295 --> 20:12.921
<i>the Sheriff's Department
has confirmed...</i>

20:12.963 --> 20:14.882
<i>that there is one victim...</i>

20:14.965 --> 20:16.091
Hey, turn that up, man.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.135
Remain sketchy,
but the sheriff--

20:18.260 --> 20:20.554
Sorry, Will.
You know the rules.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.597
Turn that back on.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.849
I know somebody
that lives in that house.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.642
Come on, turn it back on, man!

20:25.642 --> 20:26.935
I never ask for anything.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.438
Just turn on
the fucking TV, please!

20:32.941 --> 20:33.817
Fuck you, man!

20:33.901 --> 20:35.903
What the fuck is your problem?

20:35.986 --> 20:37.112
What are you doing, man?

20:37.112 --> 20:39.364
You want 10ccs of that pink
tranquilizer in your ass?

20:39.406 --> 20:40.949
That was Lori's house.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.868
They said something
about a murder.

20:42.868 --> 20:43.911
I gotta go to her.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.496
I gotta see if she's OK.

20:45.496 --> 20:47.498
Back to Springwood?

20:47.539 --> 20:49.750
Do you want me to start
having nightmares again?

20:49.791 --> 20:51.668
Don't start with that
dream demon shit again.

20:51.752 --> 20:55.172
OK? You know that's all
just in your head.

20:55.255 --> 20:58.467
Yeah, yeah, and who are you,
the poster boy for sanity?

20:58.509 --> 20:59.510
You're the one
that told the cops...

20:59.510 --> 21:01.011
Lori's dad killed his wife.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.513
Yeah, right, and now it
looks like someone else...

21:02.596 --> 21:03.639
got killed in the same house.

21:03.639 --> 21:05.140
You think that's
a coincidence?

21:05.265 --> 21:07.643
Two murders in one house?

21:07.643 --> 21:10.896
Kurt, how many times
do I have to tell you, man?

21:11.021 --> 21:12.606
I don't do checkers.

21:12.606 --> 21:14.525
I'm an UNO guy, all right?

21:14.525 --> 21:18.362
So go grab the fucking UNO deck
and we'll play, OK?

21:18.362 --> 21:19.696
Please. Thank you.

21:22.199 --> 21:25.160
Look at us, Will.

21:25.202 --> 21:27.162
Look around you, man.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.164
We're institutionalized.

21:30.541 --> 21:33.627
We're stuck here.
We're not going anywhere.

21:42.261 --> 21:44.263
I do miss my family, man.

21:44.263 --> 21:50.018
I mean, it's been four years
since I've seen 'em, you know.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.895
All these years,
and you're still convinced...

21:51.895 --> 21:53.230
you saw her father do that?

21:53.272 --> 21:55.023
I know what I saw, Mark.

21:55.023 --> 21:58.026
Fuck what the doctors try
to get me to believe.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.903
I need to know if she's OK.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.171
You want to play?

22:31.393 --> 22:33.812
Sweet dreams, monkey boy.

22:37.024 --> 22:38.650
What the hell
was that for, man?

22:40.652 --> 22:42.362
Heh heh heh!

22:45.699 --> 22:47.951
You're a fucking lunatic,
you know that?

22:48.035 --> 22:50.412
I know you are,
but what am l?

23:06.428 --> 23:07.930
Are you sure
you didn't see anyone?

23:08.013 --> 23:10.849
No, Dad, none of us did.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.769
I already went over this
with the police.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.736
It's just...

23:22.736 --> 23:24.571
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

23:24.613 --> 23:26.073
You're all I have left.

23:27.157 --> 23:29.785
Dad, I'm not going anywhere.

23:31.370 --> 23:33.288
I promise.

23:33.288 --> 23:35.499
Look at you.

23:35.499 --> 23:36.750
You're exhausted.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.336
Lori.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.505
We need to get you to bed!

23:44.132 --> 23:46.134
I don't want to
go to sleep, Dad.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.678
I just want to see my friends.

23:47.678 --> 23:50.389
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to go to school today.

23:50.389 --> 23:52.349
You've just been through
a very traumatic experience.

23:52.349 --> 23:54.601
Dad, please...

23:54.601 --> 23:57.020
I just need to get
out of the house, OK?

23:57.062 --> 24:00.274
I'll be fine.
I promise.

24:07.239 --> 24:09.074
Well, at least drink your juice.

24:14.288 --> 24:15.622
Will Rollins
and the Davis boy...

24:15.706 --> 24:17.457
escaped from Westin Hills
last night.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.710
Oh, Jesus.

24:19.710 --> 24:21.879
It's all coming apart again.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.423
Don't worry.
We'll find them.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.466
Keep this thing contained.

24:38.187 --> 24:39.354
Lori!

24:39.438 --> 24:42.608
Oh, my God! God, you guys,
I'm so glad you're here.

24:42.608 --> 24:44.359
Blake's dead, too.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.486
What?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.739
Yeah, he--

24:50.324 --> 24:54.119
He was stabbed
to death late last night.

24:54.119 --> 24:56.205
Same with his dad.

24:56.330 --> 24:57.956
What?

24:59.917 --> 25:02.794
Shit, shit!
This is bullshit!

25:02.794 --> 25:04.213
The police are blaming
everything on Blake...

25:04.296 --> 25:06.215
Iike its some kind
of Columbine thing or something.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.966
They're saying he went crazy.

25:07.966 --> 25:10.886
Killed Trey, killed his dad,
and then took his own life?

25:10.928 --> 25:13.096
This is so fucking messed up.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.640
This is messed up.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.309
Excuse me. Sorry.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.769
Lori?

25:18.769 --> 25:20.229
What is it, Linderman?

25:20.270 --> 25:21.647
Um, well, I heard
what happened,

25:21.647 --> 25:23.482
and I just wanted to
express how, um...

25:23.565 --> 25:26.026
well, to tell you
how sorry I was.

25:26.026 --> 25:28.195
Thank you.
That's sweet.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.989
Right. Actually if you need
anybody to talk to or maybe--

25:31.073 --> 25:33.158
Whoa, Linderman,
let me give you a tip.

25:33.158 --> 25:35.077
Place your hormones
back in the box...

25:35.077 --> 25:36.578
and quit while
you're ahead, OK?

25:36.662 --> 25:38.413
We don't have time
for Date-a-Dork right now.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.540
Thanks.

25:40.749 --> 25:42.417
Right. Sorry.

25:42.417 --> 25:44.336
I swear, every day
it's the same thing.

25:44.336 --> 25:45.879
He's like one of those
fucking froufrou dogs...

25:45.879 --> 25:47.214
that keeps humping your leg.

25:48.882 --> 25:50.259
Give a couple to some ladies.

25:50.342 --> 25:51.510
Thanks, man.

25:51.510 --> 25:52.469
I see what
you're saying, Gibb...

25:52.469 --> 25:53.512
but that's exactly
why you should go.

25:53.512 --> 25:55.222
I mean, be amongst friends,
where it's safe.

25:55.222 --> 25:56.473
There's gonna be a whole lot
of loving there for you...

25:56.473 --> 25:58.600
and my boy Trey, all right?

25:58.642 --> 26:00.227
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I should go.

26:00.310 --> 26:02.020
I could use a few dozen drinks.

26:02.020 --> 26:02.980
That a girl.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.731
Let your freak flag fly.

26:04.773 --> 26:06.316
See you there.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.276
You want to go?

26:07.401 --> 26:09.194
No, I don't think so.

26:09.194 --> 26:11.530
I--I didn't get much
sleep last night...

26:11.572 --> 26:13.031
and when I did sleep...

26:13.031 --> 26:14.616
I had the most
terrible nightmares.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.743
Lori, you had to sleep
at a police station.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.078
I'd have nightmares, too.

26:18.078 --> 26:19.538
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.415
I mean, this was really real.

26:21.415 --> 26:23.041
I mean, there was this man...

26:23.041 --> 26:25.043
but he more like
a monster really...

26:25.043 --> 26:26.378
and they kept
calling him Freddy...

26:26.378 --> 26:28.130
-and he was so real.
-Shh!

26:28.130 --> 26:29.423
What did he look like?

26:29.464 --> 26:32.217
He--he had this...

26:32.217 --> 26:33.969
dark brown hat, and...

26:33.969 --> 26:36.263
his skin was
terribly burnt...

26:36.388 --> 26:38.640
and on this right hand
he had this like these...

26:38.682 --> 26:40.017
razor fingers, and--

26:40.142 --> 26:41.351
You must be tripping.

26:41.435 --> 26:42.519
No, no, no!

26:42.519 --> 26:43.896
And then there were
these little girls...

26:43.896 --> 26:45.647
It's OK.
It was a bad dream.

26:45.731 --> 26:47.983
They were singing like
this--this song like--

26:47.983 --> 26:52.821
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you.

26:52.946 --> 26:54.948
You know why they sing that?

26:54.990 --> 26:57.367
Because that's when
he comes for you...

26:57.493 --> 26:59.328
in your dreams.

26:59.369 --> 27:01.371
You're lucky to be alive.

27:01.497 --> 27:02.706
Who is he?

27:02.706 --> 27:04.166
He's a child murderer...

27:04.291 --> 27:06.168
that some parents
from around here burned alive...

27:06.168 --> 27:08.420
but then he came back.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.632
Back for revenge
in our nightmares.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.217
Funny no one ever
told us about him, huh?

27:13.300 --> 27:14.468
-OK, thank you!
-No!

27:14.468 --> 27:15.552
You want some free advice?

27:15.636 --> 27:17.387
Coffee.
Make friends with it.

27:17.387 --> 27:18.889
Mark!

27:18.972 --> 27:20.098
That's enough.

27:21.517 --> 27:23.018
You're scaring her.

27:26.897 --> 27:28.982
Will?

27:28.982 --> 27:31.151
Hey.

27:34.530 --> 27:37.449
I thought you might
be in trouble, so we--

27:37.449 --> 27:38.909
Lori! Oh, my God!

27:38.909 --> 27:39.993
Lori, honey, wake up!

27:40.077 --> 27:42.371
Someone get help, please!

27:42.496 --> 27:43.872
Someone get some help, please!

27:43.997 --> 27:47.835
The principal!
Will, let's go, let's go!

27:47.876 --> 27:49.586
Please, somebody help her.
Lori?

27:57.636 --> 27:59.972
How much longer
is it gonna take?

27:59.972 --> 28:01.598
-ls she OK or what?
-Shh!

28:01.598 --> 28:03.350
Tsk!

28:25.622 --> 28:28.333
For nose jobs,
what kind of anesthesia...

28:28.333 --> 28:29.960
do the doctors use?

28:29.960 --> 28:31.545
They put you
all the way under, right?

28:45.809 --> 28:46.977
Got your nose!

28:53.859 --> 28:55.360
Strong work, man.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.486
I came to make sure she's OK...

28:56.486 --> 28:58.739
and you put her
in the infirmary.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.702
What were you
thinking about...

29:03.702 --> 29:05.454
telling her
all that stuff, man?

29:05.454 --> 29:06.663
I mean, we're not in group.

29:06.663 --> 29:07.748
Because I'm thinking
for the first time in my life...

29:07.748 --> 29:09.583
that maybe I'm not crazy...

29:09.583 --> 29:11.084
that my brother wasn't crazy.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.045
She had the same dream, Will.

29:13.045 --> 29:14.963
Will Rollins!
Mark Davis!

29:24.932 --> 29:26.308
This doesn't make any sense.

29:26.308 --> 29:27.643
There's nothing on Krueger.

29:27.768 --> 29:30.604
Not his arrest, his death,
not even a birth certificate.

29:30.687 --> 29:33.232
Whole sections of
the records are gone.

29:33.232 --> 29:36.443
Look at all these
blacked-out obituaries.

29:44.117 --> 29:45.702
January eighteenth.

29:45.786 --> 29:48.914
That's the day my brother
committed suicide.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.916
Why isn't that in here?

29:52.835 --> 29:55.462
I don't know!

29:55.462 --> 29:57.714
But I'm sure there's
a good reason.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.592
Remember in group
when they told us...

30:00.592 --> 30:01.969
not to jump to conclusions?

30:01.969 --> 30:03.053
Listen to yourself.

30:03.053 --> 30:04.888
You're holding onto
that psychobabble bullshit...

30:04.888 --> 30:07.391
Iike it's some kind of
security blanket, man.

30:07.391 --> 30:10.894
Let it go.
They've covered him up, Will.

30:10.894 --> 30:12.271
They never told us
about Freddy...

30:12.271 --> 30:14.147
because that's how they
decided to beat him.

30:14.147 --> 30:16.942
They treated him like he
was a fucking disease...

30:16.942 --> 30:17.985
and they locked up
all the kids...

30:17.985 --> 30:18.944
who had made
contact with him...

30:18.944 --> 30:20.571
so they wouldn't
infect the others.

30:20.654 --> 30:21.864
That's crazy.

30:21.864 --> 30:24.241
Is it?

30:24.241 --> 30:26.410
How come we were
never allowed...

30:26.493 --> 30:28.912
to call any of
our friends, man?

30:28.912 --> 30:31.123
How come none of our
friends ever called us?

30:31.206 --> 30:34.042
We were in a fucking
quarantine, man.

30:34.168 --> 30:36.545
That's what
Westin Hills was for.

30:36.545 --> 30:38.797
Well, even if all
you're saying is true...

30:38.797 --> 30:41.091
then why didn't
Freddy kill Lori?

30:41.216 --> 30:43.594
Maybe he's not
strong enough yet.

30:43.635 --> 30:46.138
My brother said it's our fear
that gives him his power.

30:46.221 --> 30:47.514
Yeah, well,
you sure as hell...

30:47.514 --> 30:50.017
spread enough fear
today at school.

30:50.017 --> 30:51.894
Holy shit.

30:56.064 --> 30:57.274
You're right.

30:57.357 --> 31:01.361
They wanted to forget Freddy so
they wouldn't fear him.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.822
What if I screwed up
the town's plan?

31:04.990 --> 31:07.701
Fuck! This fucker's gonna spread
like the plague, man!

31:07.826 --> 31:10.871
Kids are gonna start
falling asleep, it's gonna--

31:10.913 --> 31:12.289
Let's leave, man.
Let's leave right now.

31:12.372 --> 31:13.248
No, I can't leave.

31:13.290 --> 31:14.374
Why not?

31:14.458 --> 31:16.251
I gotta go talk to Lori.
I gotta see if she's OK.

31:16.251 --> 31:17.544
Well, is she worth dying for?

31:17.544 --> 31:20.047
Because if you fall asleep,
you ain't waking up.

31:20.047 --> 31:23.258
If that's the case,
how come you're not dead?

31:23.258 --> 31:24.426
Or any of the freaks at Westin?

31:24.426 --> 31:27.554
When's the last time
you even had a nightmare?

31:27.596 --> 31:29.014
I don't know.

31:29.056 --> 31:30.891
I can't remember
my dreams anymore.

31:32.392 --> 31:35.312
Look, just give me
one night, OK?

31:35.354 --> 31:38.148
Just let me find Lori,
and then we're out of here.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.443
I swear.

31:42.778 --> 31:43.695
All right.

31:43.779 --> 31:45.489
If your ass isn't back here by
dawn, I'm gone.

31:45.489 --> 31:48.492
We clear on that?

31:48.492 --> 31:52.162
This baby's my brother's
pride and joy, so be careful.

32:23.527 --> 32:24.528
Oh, shit.

32:24.528 --> 32:25.529
Linderman!

32:25.571 --> 32:28.448
Shack, I don't drink.

32:47.009 --> 32:50.429
Hi, Lori. Didn't think
I'd see you here.

32:50.429 --> 32:52.097
Can I get you
something to drink?

32:52.097 --> 32:55.601
Smooth opening, but, you know,
we're already taken care of.

32:55.601 --> 32:57.853
What happened
to your clothes?

32:57.853 --> 32:59.855
Oh, this.

32:59.980 --> 33:00.981
I was playing
a drinking game...

33:01.064 --> 33:04.276
with some
of the lower primates...

33:04.276 --> 33:05.736
and I guess I'm penalized
for my ability...

33:05.777 --> 33:07.321
to read above
a fourth-grade level.

33:07.362 --> 33:09.072
Linderman, you know,
I always pictured you...

33:09.072 --> 33:11.366
as a straight up bedwetter.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.368
You know what, Kia?

33:13.368 --> 33:14.828
I used to think you hated me...

33:14.828 --> 33:16.455
because you thought
I wasn't good enough for Lori...

33:16.455 --> 33:17.664
but that's not it.

33:17.748 --> 33:19.917
You tear me down
to make yourself feel better...

33:19.917 --> 33:21.251
because you really
hate yourself...

33:21.251 --> 33:22.961
which is kind of pathetic
when you actually...

33:22.961 --> 33:24.087
stop and think about it,
assuming, of course...

33:24.087 --> 33:25.923
you can think
with all that makeup...

33:25.923 --> 33:27.925
weighing down your head.

33:33.555 --> 33:35.516
The cops said Blake
committed suicide.

33:35.557 --> 33:37.017
Apparently,
it was grief over Trey.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.227
No, man, that's bullshit.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.229
I heard some guy Krueger
killed them both.

33:40.229 --> 33:42.189
Said his name to my parents,
they almost shit themselves.

33:42.189 --> 33:43.106
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,
and I heard...

33:43.106 --> 33:44.525
that Freddy freak,
he used to live here.

33:44.525 --> 33:46.860
Fucking gutted Trey like
a Goddamn turkey, man.

33:46.902 --> 33:50.739
Like I heard his intestines and
shit was on the floor--

33:50.739 --> 33:53.826
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

33:56.203 --> 33:58.288
Oh, my God.

33:58.288 --> 34:00.874
Look who's here.
Look who's here!

34:09.967 --> 34:11.885
What are you looking at?

34:11.969 --> 34:14.179
Come on, come on, let's dance.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.514
Come on, Linderman, let's go.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.433
Where have you been, Will?

34:18.516 --> 34:20.185
Didn't you get my letters?

34:20.185 --> 34:21.562
What letters?

34:21.562 --> 34:24.438
They must've never
even mailed them.

34:24.438 --> 34:27.317
Who?

34:27.317 --> 34:31.362
The...doctors at Westin Hills.

34:32.572 --> 34:35.659
I've been in
a psychiatric hospital.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.119
Mark was with me there.

34:37.119 --> 34:39.871
Some other kids, too.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.790
I don't understand.

34:44.042 --> 34:45.627
Well, I saw on the news
the other night...

34:45.627 --> 34:47.629
I mean, that kid that was
killed at your house.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.340
I mean, I needed to know
that you were safe.

34:50.424 --> 34:51.925
What happened?

34:51.925 --> 34:53.385
I don't know.
I don't know.

34:53.385 --> 34:55.179
Nobody knows.
Nobody saw what happened...

34:55.179 --> 34:56.638
and the police have been
acting really weird...

34:56.638 --> 34:58.056
Iike they know something...

34:58.056 --> 35:00.184
and I heard them
mention some name.

35:00.184 --> 35:01.810
Some...

35:01.935 --> 35:04.146
Freddy. Freddy Krueger.

35:04.146 --> 35:05.981
Where was your dad?

35:06.064 --> 35:07.316
Out of town.

35:07.441 --> 35:08.609
Are you sure?

35:08.734 --> 35:10.235
What is going on, Will?

35:10.319 --> 35:11.820
Well, look, four years ago,
I thought l--

35:11.945 --> 35:13.030
Enough with
this bullshit talk.

35:13.071 --> 35:15.032
Let's go shake our ass
on the dance floor.

35:15.032 --> 35:16.283
Come on!

35:33.967 --> 35:35.761
I'm dead one day...

35:35.761 --> 35:37.763
and you're already out
getting shit-faced?

35:37.763 --> 35:38.931
Same old Gibb!

35:38.972 --> 35:43.393
Trey, l--
I can't believe it.

35:43.477 --> 35:45.062
Come on, let's go.

35:47.064 --> 35:50.526
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

35:52.110 --> 35:53.862
Now!

36:03.372 --> 36:05.249
Trey?

36:52.045 --> 36:53.797
No!

36:53.881 --> 36:55.632
Open the door!

36:55.716 --> 36:57.384
Please, the door--

37:39.801 --> 37:41.678
No! No!

38:03.826 --> 38:05.452
You're the one
that killed Trey!

38:05.452 --> 38:09.873
Oh, don't worry about
my little errand boy.

38:09.998 --> 38:14.461
The only to fear
is fear himself!

39:38.128 --> 39:40.380
No!

39:42.007 --> 39:43.509
She's mine.

39:43.550 --> 39:46.762
Mine! Mine!

39:53.393 --> 39:56.855
This everclear
is kicking my ass.

39:56.855 --> 39:57.898
This--

40:10.744 --> 40:13.205
Check out this fucking guy.

40:13.205 --> 40:14.414
Well, hey, Jethro!

40:14.414 --> 40:17.417
This is a rave,
not a Halloween party.

40:17.417 --> 40:21.171
Why don't you go
find yourself a pig to fuck?

40:21.171 --> 40:22.673
Yeah!

40:22.673 --> 40:25.968
Invite only, cornpoke,
and you weren't invite--

40:26.009 --> 40:28.011
Son of a bitch.

40:37.312 --> 40:38.689
Yeah!

40:38.814 --> 40:41.483
Burn, motherfucker!

40:59.418 --> 41:01.587
No!

41:28.614 --> 41:29.573
Run, man, run!

41:40.626 --> 41:43.545
Freak!
You killed my brother!

41:56.517 --> 41:58.727
Gibb! Oh, my God!

41:58.810 --> 42:00.562
Oh, Gibb! No!

42:00.562 --> 42:02.022
Let's go!
Let's go, come on!

42:08.403 --> 42:10.405
Was that him?

42:10.447 --> 42:12.574
The guy you were talking about--
Freddy Krueger.

42:12.658 --> 42:14.326
No, that wasn't
the guy in my dream.

42:14.326 --> 42:15.244
That was somebody else!

42:15.369 --> 42:18.163
Who cares about some
fucking dream guy, OK?

42:18.163 --> 42:19.915
That psycho
in the hockey mask was real.

42:19.998 --> 42:22.167
Dude, that goalie was
pissed about something.

42:22.209 --> 42:23.377
We need to find the police.

42:23.418 --> 42:25.546
No, no! Fuck the police!

42:25.671 --> 42:27.130
Just take me home, Will.

42:36.473 --> 42:38.767
Gibb, l--

42:38.851 --> 42:40.310
I can't believe she...

42:40.352 --> 42:41.395
I know.

42:45.816 --> 42:48.652
Look, call me later, OK?
Please.

42:48.652 --> 42:50.195
Just to check in.

42:56.785 --> 42:57.619
Bye, Will.

42:57.703 --> 42:59.997
Be careful.

43:18.182 --> 43:19.600
Will, I'm gonna go inside now.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.436
I think that's the last thing
you should do right now.

43:22.477 --> 43:24.188
Oh, Will, please.

43:24.188 --> 43:25.230
After everything
that's happened...

43:25.272 --> 43:26.148
I just want to go to--

43:26.273 --> 43:28.859
There's more
to it than that.

43:28.859 --> 43:32.279
Look, I tried to tell
you this earlier.

43:32.321 --> 43:33.822
The reason
I was sent to Westin...

43:33.822 --> 43:38.160
is because I saw
your dad kill your mom.

43:39.203 --> 43:41.663
Will, my mom died
in a car accident.

43:41.788 --> 43:43.957
No, that's what he
wanted you to believe...

43:44.082 --> 43:45.167
but I was there, Lori.

43:45.250 --> 43:48.378
I was sneaking up to your room,
like I used to do.

43:48.462 --> 43:50.172
Only you weren't there.

43:52.716 --> 43:55.010
I saw him kill her.

43:56.762 --> 43:57.679
Dad!

43:57.721 --> 43:59.014
Get out of the van.

43:59.139 --> 44:00.641
Get out of the van!
Where were you?

44:00.724 --> 44:01.558
What are you doing?

44:01.683 --> 44:03.018
I've been looking
all over for you!

44:03.018 --> 44:04.102
Get away from her!

44:04.102 --> 44:05.437
You're in a helluva
lot of trouble, you know that?

44:05.479 --> 44:07.022
Like I give
a shit anymore.

44:07.022 --> 44:08.232
Get in the house!

44:08.232 --> 44:09.441
You! I'm taking you
back to Westin.

44:09.483 --> 44:11.401
No! No way!
You can't trust him, Lori.

44:11.401 --> 44:13.070
Whatever you do,
don't go home with him!

44:13.153 --> 44:14.655
No, listen to me!

44:14.780 --> 44:16.615
He was the one
who had me committed!

44:16.657 --> 44:18.116
You didn't understand.

44:18.242 --> 44:19.576
You still don't.
You were confused!

44:19.618 --> 44:20.619
Stop it!

44:20.619 --> 44:22.120
Both of you, stop it!

44:22.162 --> 44:23.705
Damn it, Will!
I am not gonna let you...

44:23.705 --> 44:25.582
endanger my daughter again!

44:25.582 --> 44:27.709
Not after everything
that's happened!

44:27.793 --> 44:29.962
Stop it! Stop it! Fuck!

44:30.003 --> 44:32.256
Lori!

44:37.719 --> 44:40.264
I--l--

44:40.264 --> 44:42.140
Did Mom die
in a car accident?

44:42.182 --> 44:44.184
Yes. Of course she did.

44:44.268 --> 44:45.686
Prove it.

44:45.686 --> 44:47.271
Show me a death certificate.

44:47.271 --> 44:49.523
Show me an autopsy report.

44:49.523 --> 44:52.067
Lori, I don't think now
is the right time--

44:52.067 --> 44:53.026
Really, Dad?

44:53.026 --> 44:54.736
Because I think
it's a perfect time!

44:54.820 --> 44:56.405
Why didn't you tell me
about Westin Hills?

44:56.405 --> 44:57.823
Do you work there?

44:57.823 --> 44:59.908
Because I thought you were
a fucking general practitioner!

45:00.033 --> 45:01.827
Yes, l...

45:01.910 --> 45:04.246
I do some consulting
there now, but...

45:04.329 --> 45:05.956
it's--it isn't
what you think.

45:05.956 --> 45:09.418
Oh, my God.

45:09.418 --> 45:12.212
So you knew about Will
this whole time.

45:12.212 --> 45:15.716
Lori, listen to me.

45:15.716 --> 45:19.720
You're upset.
We both are.

45:19.845 --> 45:21.722
Now I think what you need now...

45:21.722 --> 45:24.892
more than anything
is to get some rest.

45:24.933 --> 45:26.518
Why don't I give you
some pills...

45:26.518 --> 45:28.145
and that'll help you sleep...

45:28.228 --> 45:30.522
and then we talk
about it in the morning?

45:30.647 --> 45:32.357
I don't want
to sleep, Dad!

45:32.357 --> 45:34.359
I want to know why
you've been lying to me!

45:34.443 --> 45:35.486
We'll talk about it
in the morning!

45:35.486 --> 45:37.196
Now do what I say!

45:37.196 --> 45:38.530
Lori! Lori!

45:42.910 --> 45:45.078
Open this door.
Open this door!

45:45.162 --> 45:46.413
Go away!

45:46.413 --> 45:47.372
Damn it, Lori!

45:47.372 --> 45:48.999
<i>Let me in!</i>

45:54.838 --> 45:55.881
Goddamn it!

46:17.402 --> 46:19.780
It's OK, it's me.
It's me, shh! Shh!

46:19.780 --> 46:21.824
You OK? Are you OK?

46:21.949 --> 46:23.951
It's me, all right?

46:23.992 --> 46:28.622
I don't know how your father's
connected to all this...

46:28.622 --> 46:29.915
but I think
Mark was right.

46:29.915 --> 46:32.626
There's some kind of cover-up
going on here with Krueger.

46:34.545 --> 46:36.713
We can't trust the police.

46:38.340 --> 46:39.967
We can't trust
any of the adults.

46:42.219 --> 46:43.679
So what do we do?

46:43.679 --> 46:45.347
We gotta get to Mark.

46:45.597 --> 46:47.182
He's the expert in all of this.

46:47.182 --> 46:48.141
He'll know what's going on.

46:58.277 --> 47:02.781
You always looked out
for me, bro.

47:03.782 --> 47:06.034
<i>Hey, Mark.</i>

47:40.027 --> 47:41.403
I gotta stay awake.

47:57.669 --> 47:59.338
Shit!

48:10.807 --> 48:12.684
Hey, Mark.

48:12.809 --> 48:14.228
You didn't forget
about me, did you?

48:14.311 --> 48:15.604
Oh, God.

48:15.646 --> 48:17.606
Oh, that's right!

48:17.648 --> 48:18.941
Everyone forgot!

48:18.941 --> 48:21.235
That's why they weren't
afraid anymore!

48:21.235 --> 48:22.778
That's why I needed Jason
to kill for me...

48:22.778 --> 48:24.780
to get them to remember.

48:24.780 --> 48:29.785
But now he just won't stop,
that hockey puck!

48:37.251 --> 48:40.587
This isn't...real.

48:42.881 --> 48:46.343
Somebody, please, wake me up!

48:46.426 --> 48:47.636
Please!

48:58.063 --> 49:00.732
Mark! Mark, wake up!

49:00.858 --> 49:03.443
I need you to send
a little message for me.

49:03.527 --> 49:06.738
That's all,
just a little message.

49:06.738 --> 49:08.615
I'm not gonna do it.

49:08.615 --> 49:10.200
I won't do it!

49:10.200 --> 49:12.661
No?!

49:12.661 --> 49:15.455
I won't do it.

49:23.505 --> 49:29.094
I'll have to pass that message
myself, won't l?

49:34.057 --> 49:35.851
Oh, my God!

49:39.188 --> 49:42.983
Let go of me!

49:42.983 --> 49:44.568
Help...me.

49:44.568 --> 49:46.153
Mark!

49:56.163 --> 50:00.292
<i>Pass on a little
message for me, will ya?</i>

50:11.303 --> 50:14.097
Sheriff,
I've been compiling info...

50:14.181 --> 50:16.058
based on eyewitness reports
of the hockey mask killer.

50:16.058 --> 50:17.684
We already know who did this.

50:17.809 --> 50:19.686
Sheriff, we closed
down the school...

50:19.686 --> 50:21.396
and set up a curfew
for anyone under eighteen.

50:21.396 --> 50:22.523
Good.

50:22.523 --> 50:24.233
Now I want twenty-four-hour
roadblocks set up.

50:24.233 --> 50:25.818
Nobody leaves town,
nobody gets in.

50:25.859 --> 50:27.319
We're gonna contain
this son of a bitch...

50:27.319 --> 50:28.403
before he spreads any further.

50:28.487 --> 50:30.656
Yes, sir.

50:30.656 --> 50:32.491
Sir, shouldn't we have
the F.B.I. come in and--

50:32.491 --> 50:34.535
No outsiders, Stubbs.

50:34.660 --> 50:37.037
We can handle this.
We've stopped him before.

50:37.037 --> 50:39.206
OK, I'm a little lost here.

50:39.206 --> 50:40.541
Stopped who before?

50:40.541 --> 50:43.710
We don't say his name out loud.

50:43.710 --> 50:45.504
You're not from around here.

50:45.587 --> 50:46.505
I don't expect you
to understand.

50:46.547 --> 50:48.549
With all due resect, Sheriff...

50:48.549 --> 50:51.051
I think we have a copycat
of the old Jason Voorhees...

50:51.093 --> 50:52.386
Crystal Lake killer
on our hands--

50:52.386 --> 50:53.637
You listen to me.

50:53.637 --> 50:56.014
We do things around here
a certain way for a reason...

50:56.056 --> 50:58.308
and that's given us
four years of peace.

50:58.392 --> 51:00.394
So you either do your job
and keep your mouth shut...

51:00.394 --> 51:02.437
or, so help me God,
I will lock you up!

51:02.563 --> 51:04.815
Do you understand me?!

51:07.776 --> 51:08.819
Yes, sir.

51:19.121 --> 51:20.873
Why don't we all just leave?

51:20.873 --> 51:25.419
No, even if we leave,
Freddy can still get us.

51:25.502 --> 51:28.755
We all know about him.
We're all afraid of him.

51:30.465 --> 51:34.928
It was our fear that
gave him his power.

51:35.012 --> 51:37.472
We're marked now.

51:37.556 --> 51:39.266
Man, screw that clown.

51:39.308 --> 51:40.642
I mean, what kind
of a pussy...

51:40.767 --> 51:42.269
comes after you
in your dreams anyway?

51:42.352 --> 51:45.189
Now, that big-ass mother fucker
back at the cornfield...

51:45.314 --> 51:47.399
all right, that's who
we should be afraid of.

51:47.399 --> 51:49.568
Tell me who
the fuck that was.

51:49.610 --> 51:51.862
His name was Jason Voorhees.

51:51.862 --> 51:55.073
Shit, man...um...

51:55.073 --> 51:57.868
How'd you know
we were here?

51:57.951 --> 51:59.995
Nothing personal,
but the Scooby van out back...

52:00.120 --> 52:01.747
wasn't exactly subtle.

52:01.747 --> 52:03.999
And never keep
your keys in the door.

52:04.124 --> 52:06.251
Great, so now we're
completely fucked.

52:06.251 --> 52:08.128
No, you're not.

52:08.170 --> 52:10.547
I'm here to help you.

52:10.672 --> 52:13.258
Now, this Jason Voorhees
supposedly drowned...

52:13.258 --> 52:15.677
at Camp Crystal Lake
back in 1957...

52:15.761 --> 52:17.471
when he was
eleven years old.

52:17.471 --> 52:20.182
The counselors weren't
watching him...

52:20.182 --> 52:22.851
then they made the mistake
of killing his mother.

52:22.851 --> 52:24.978
The legend has it...

52:24.978 --> 52:27.356
that Jason kept returning
from his grave...

52:27.356 --> 52:29.233
to punish whoever
returned to the camp.

52:29.233 --> 52:32.027
I think we're dealing
with a copycat here.

52:32.027 --> 52:33.529
No. No. No, no, no.

52:33.570 --> 52:35.030
He's not a copycat.

52:35.030 --> 52:36.615
I've seen what he can do.
He's the real Jason.

52:36.615 --> 52:38.867
That's impossible, Linderman.
Jason is dead.

52:38.867 --> 52:41.912
You'd better start thinking
outside your little box, dude...

52:41.954 --> 52:43.497
'cause somebody's
definitely breaking...

52:43.580 --> 52:45.499
the fucking reality rules, OK?

52:45.582 --> 52:46.875
It makes sense in a way.

52:46.875 --> 52:50.295
I mean, what if Freddy
brought Jason back...

52:50.379 --> 52:52.506
because he was too weak
to go after us on his own...

52:52.506 --> 52:55.008
so he used Jason.

52:55.008 --> 52:57.010
I mean, he knew that
we'd think it was him...

52:57.052 --> 52:58.512
that we'd spread
the fear again.

52:58.512 --> 52:59.680
And now that it's working...

52:59.721 --> 53:02.224
it's like he can't
shut Jason back down.

53:02.224 --> 53:03.809
Wait a minute.

53:03.809 --> 53:06.687
Freddy died by fire,
Jason by water.

53:06.770 --> 53:08.772
How can we use that?

53:08.772 --> 53:11.483
I think we should
concentrate on Jason first.

53:11.483 --> 53:13.068
But I thought we decided...

53:13.152 --> 53:14.778
that Freddy was the one
pulling the strings.

53:14.820 --> 53:17.197
Shouldn't we go
after him first?

53:17.197 --> 53:19.700
I don't know, maybe
what we need to do is...

53:19.783 --> 53:22.286
to offer Freddy
a sacrifice.

53:22.369 --> 53:23.787
Yeah, yeah, totally.

53:23.871 --> 53:26.915
Like a virgin, right?
Someone pure.

53:32.087 --> 53:34.423
Dude, don't look at me.

53:34.464 --> 53:36.800
Even if you pay for it,
it still counts.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.802
Oh, come on.

53:38.886 --> 53:41.513
Look, we all know who
the real virgin is here.

53:41.513 --> 53:44.057
-Kia!
-Oh, come on, Lori.

53:44.183 --> 53:45.934
I know you never
made it with Will.

53:46.018 --> 53:50.564
Why would he want to when
he can fuck somebody like me?

53:55.777 --> 53:57.279
Let's tie the bitch up.

54:00.157 --> 54:02.075
What?

54:04.369 --> 54:06.705
Don't worry, angel.

54:06.705 --> 54:08.332
You've still got me.

54:08.373 --> 54:10.709
Come on, give daddy a kiss.

54:15.172 --> 54:18.675
Your eyes say no-no...

54:18.759 --> 54:23.055
but my mouth says yes-yes.

54:27.226 --> 54:28.811
Lori, are you all right?

54:28.811 --> 54:30.020
You fell asleep.

54:37.778 --> 54:39.780
Oh, shit!

54:43.492 --> 54:45.369
I pulled that out of my dream.

54:45.494 --> 54:47.371
How is that possible?

54:47.371 --> 54:49.331
Anything is possible now!

54:49.373 --> 54:50.582
God, you just don't get it!

54:50.582 --> 54:52.668
Oh, God, y'all, two killers?

54:52.709 --> 54:54.461
We're not safe awake or asleep.

54:54.586 --> 54:56.338
It's not the sleep
that's killing us...

54:56.338 --> 54:57.256
it's our dreams.

54:57.256 --> 54:59.883
At Westin, Mark and l
never had dreams.

54:59.883 --> 55:02.469
Were you on any drugs?

55:02.594 --> 55:04.888
Yeah, but there's
something called hypnocil.

55:04.888 --> 55:06.890
They never told us
what it was for...

55:06.890 --> 55:08.809
but everyone there
was taking it.

55:10.894 --> 55:13.397
Experimental drug...

55:13.438 --> 55:14.857
not even approved yet
by the F.D.A.

55:14.982 --> 55:16.733
Oh, shit.

55:16.733 --> 55:20.487
Used for...
suppression of dreams.

55:20.487 --> 55:23.824
We need those pills,
enough for all of us.

55:23.907 --> 55:25.909
Can you get us
back to Westin Hills?

55:45.429 --> 55:46.930
All right,
this isn't it, guys.

55:47.014 --> 55:48.765
Come on, let's go.

55:48.765 --> 55:49.725
Hey, dude.

55:49.725 --> 55:51.018
Let's take a little
J-break, huh?

55:51.018 --> 55:53.562
No, man. He's a cop.

55:53.645 --> 55:56.023
Come on. What's he
gonna do, arrest me?

55:56.148 --> 55:58.400
Hold up.
Hang on a second.

55:58.400 --> 55:59.610
Fuck.

56:08.285 --> 56:10.037
That's better.

56:24.635 --> 56:26.720
Where's Freeburg?

56:26.845 --> 56:27.763
Come on. Come on!

56:44.780 --> 56:45.948
This is "D" wing.

56:45.989 --> 56:48.534
These are the ones
who wouldn't stop dreaming.

56:56.250 --> 56:57.417
Are they dead?

57:00.671 --> 57:03.590
They're in a coma.

57:03.590 --> 57:06.218
It says they were given
too much hypnocil.

57:07.594 --> 57:09.346
Who would do this to people?

57:09.346 --> 57:11.890
Your dad's name
is at the bottom...

57:11.890 --> 57:13.475
of both of these charts.

57:21.191 --> 57:23.485
Cool...yeah.

57:33.078 --> 57:35.539
What the fuck?

57:48.844 --> 57:50.179
Nice.

57:57.561 --> 57:59.188
Oh, yeah.

58:03.525 --> 58:05.152
Hold up, man.

58:16.705 --> 58:17.706
What?

58:23.462 --> 58:24.546
What do you want?

58:27.591 --> 58:31.094
No, I don't know where
the hypnocil is, OK?

58:41.730 --> 58:42.981
I can't pour these
down the drain.

58:42.981 --> 58:44.358
We need this stuff.

59:00.499 --> 59:01.875
Freeburg!

59:03.794 --> 59:04.628
Freeburg!

59:04.753 --> 59:05.963
What are you doing?

59:06.046 --> 59:07.005
We need those drugs!

59:08.048 --> 59:09.258
Dude, no! Dude--

59:15.931 --> 59:17.558
Go on! Get out of here!

59:17.558 --> 59:19.143
Go!

59:34.158 --> 59:35.492
What was that?

59:38.704 --> 59:40.164
Let's go check it out.
Let's go.

59:41.456 --> 59:45.460
Get back! Shit! Hell!

59:45.460 --> 59:46.962
Fucker!

59:46.962 --> 59:48.297
Help me!

01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:05.898
Shit! They're all empty!

01:00:05.939 --> 01:00:06.857
We gotta keep looking.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.192
Maybe there's some down here.

01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:10.194
Damn, it's gotta
be here somewhere.

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.497
Freeburg, come on!

01:00:21.497 --> 01:00:23.290
Come on! Come on!

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.459
What are you waiting for?
Come on!

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:27.544
Freeburg, time to go.

01:00:27.544 --> 01:00:29.796
We gotta go!
Now! come on!

01:00:29.796 --> 01:00:32.341
Let me handle this, bitch.

01:00:32.341 --> 01:00:33.967
What?

01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:37.137
Come on, come on!
OK, let's go!

01:00:38.514 --> 01:00:39.806
Let's go.

01:00:39.848 --> 01:00:40.891
No, wait, wait!

01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:41.934
Look.

01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:46.897
Come to Freddy.

01:00:48.023 --> 01:00:50.818
These are my children, Jason.

01:00:51.193 --> 01:00:53.487
Go back where you belong!

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:05.916
Fuck you!

01:01:07.626 --> 01:01:09.461
Linderman...

01:01:11.255 --> 01:01:14.466
<i>These are my children, Jason.</i>

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.844
<i>Go back where you belong.</i>

01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:32.359
<i>Jason...Jason.</i>

01:01:32.442 --> 01:01:35.654
<i>My special, special boy.</i>

01:01:39.825 --> 01:01:42.077
I'm disappointed
in you, Jason.

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:43.954
You disobeyed me.

01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:45.539
You were supposed
to come back home...

01:01:45.664 --> 01:01:47.291
just kill a few of them!

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:49.418
But I blame myself.
I should've known...

01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:51.545
you wouldn't be able
to stop killing!

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:56.508
You are like a big, stupid dog
who can't stop eating...

01:01:56.592 --> 01:02:00.804
even though your master
said you've had enough!

01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:10.898
Now it's time to put
this bad dog to sleep...

01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:14.318
for good!

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.701
Not my arm!

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:50.145
Welcome to my nightmare.

01:03:09.414 --> 01:03:11.583
Penny for your thoughts, chief!

01:03:13.335 --> 01:03:15.420
Oh, scary.

01:03:34.523 --> 01:03:35.732
Tilt.

01:03:58.422 --> 01:04:00.465
Why won't you die?

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:27.075
Come on. Come on!

01:04:44.384 --> 01:04:47.763
So you are afraid of something
after all, huh?

01:04:57.731 --> 01:05:00.275
How in the fuck did I let y'all
talk me into this?

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.277
Why don't we just
try and do it here?

01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:04.196
Why go all the way
to Crystal Lake?

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:06.281
Best-case scenario: Jason wins.

01:05:06.323 --> 01:05:08.867
He'll already be home,
back where he belongs.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.160
I mean, why follow us anymore?

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.787
And if Freddy wins?

01:05:11.787 --> 01:05:14.623
At least Jason
has home-field advantage.

01:05:38.772 --> 01:05:41.984
Aww...how sweet.

01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:45.195
You ugly little shit.

01:05:45.195 --> 01:05:49.825
Now there's a face...
only a mother could love!

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.245
Yeah!

01:05:53.245 --> 01:05:55.080
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.624
Let's see
what really scares you.

01:06:04.423 --> 01:06:07.176
And dig a little deeper.

01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:39.917
<i>I'm dying to see what skeletons
are hidden in your closet.</i>

01:06:55.974 --> 01:06:58.227
We're seriously running
out of tranq here, guys.

01:06:58.227 --> 01:07:01.438
I got maybe one dose,
plus enough for Lori.

01:07:01.438 --> 01:07:02.648
Well, we're almost there.

01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:03.982
Then I better get going.

01:07:03.982 --> 01:07:05.192
No, no, just...

01:07:10.072 --> 01:07:11.323
I don't want you to go.

01:07:11.323 --> 01:07:12.783
I'm coming back.

01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:15.452
Just give me fifteen minutes,
then wake me up.

01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:17.579
I'll bring that bastard
Freddy back through.

01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:20.290
Just make sure
Jason's waiting for him.

01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:27.631
Now I lay me down to sleep.

01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:52.489
Freak show! Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

01:07:52.573 --> 01:07:53.949
Bull's-eye!

01:07:57.953 --> 01:07:59.830
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

01:07:59.955 --> 01:08:01.206
Try this on!

01:08:02.374 --> 01:08:05.377
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

01:08:09.131 --> 01:08:10.507
Stupid!

01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:15.596
Aren't you gonna help the kid?!

01:08:15.596 --> 01:08:17.973
Can't you see I'm busy here?

01:08:18.098 --> 01:08:19.433
You mean you're not coming?

01:08:22.227 --> 01:08:25.354
It's not my fault this bitch
is dead on her feet.

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:35.323
It's been five minutes.

01:08:35.448 --> 01:08:37.493
Well, that was the last
of the tranq, OK? We're out.

01:08:37.493 --> 01:08:39.328
Calm down, OK?
Just relax!

01:08:52.591 --> 01:08:54.426
Heeeeelp!

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:57.930
Wait! Give me your hand!

01:08:58.055 --> 01:09:00.682
Give me your hand!

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.143
Help!

01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:05.395
Jason?

01:09:05.395 --> 01:09:07.104
Jason Vorhees?

01:09:17.282 --> 01:09:19.243
Y'all...y'all...

01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:20.202
Y'all, something's wrong.

01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:21.453
It's like he's drowning
or something.

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:22.746
Freddy must be killing him.

01:09:22.787 --> 01:09:23.705
We need him alive!

01:09:23.788 --> 01:09:24.790
Dude, what do you
want me to do...

01:09:24.915 --> 01:09:27.209
Iike, give him
mouth-to-mouth or something?

01:09:34.633 --> 01:09:36.385
Hell no.
Why are you--

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:38.804
No! No, I'm not
gonna do that. No!

01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:40.013
Kia, look, I would
do it myself...

01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:41.682
but I've had asthma
since I was six, OK?

01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:43.183
I don't have the lung power.

01:09:43.183 --> 01:09:44.560
No.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.812
Kia, he has asthma!

01:09:46.895 --> 01:09:49.314
Ooh! Ooh...

01:09:50.566 --> 01:09:52.151
Look, you can do this, OK?

01:09:52.151 --> 01:09:53.234
You can do this.
You just--

01:09:53.234 --> 01:09:56.864
Shut up! You're not the one
that has to do this.

01:09:56.947 --> 01:09:57.906
I know, but l--

01:09:57.906 --> 01:09:59.199
Shut up!

01:10:02.161 --> 01:10:04.163
Oh, my God.

01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:08.417
Ohh, God!

01:10:13.338 --> 01:10:14.965
Oh, man.

01:10:15.007 --> 01:10:17.885
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:10:40.616 --> 01:10:42.659
You!

01:10:56.256 --> 01:10:57.966
What's wrong, Lori?

01:10:57.966 --> 01:10:59.760
Miss your wake-up call?

01:11:02.137 --> 01:11:04.306
Wake me up!
I got him! I got him!

01:11:09.186 --> 01:11:11.188
No!

01:11:11.313 --> 01:11:12.272
Lori, come on! Wake up!

01:11:12.314 --> 01:11:13.899
Lori, wake up, please!

01:11:13.899 --> 01:11:15.275
Look!

01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:16.693
Guys, look.

01:11:18.403 --> 01:11:19.446
We're almost there.

01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:22.157
Help me. Come on.
We gotta get her up.

01:11:23.367 --> 01:11:25.369
Come on. Start running.
Start running.

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.204
Wake me up!

01:11:28.872 --> 01:11:30.457
Daddy, don't!

01:11:55.816 --> 01:11:58.110
Daddy!
No, daddy, don't!

01:11:58.193 --> 01:12:00.070
Freddy!
It was you!

01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:01.947
I've always had a thing...

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.741
for the whores
that live in this house.

01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:15.460
Lori, wake up!

01:12:18.255 --> 01:12:19.548
Oh, shit.

01:12:24.303 --> 01:12:25.721
It's him. He's here.

01:12:25.762 --> 01:12:27.222
Lori, come on!
You gotta wake up!

01:12:31.852 --> 01:12:33.353
Oh, yes.

01:12:38.275 --> 01:12:40.152
My God!

01:12:42.196 --> 01:12:43.822
Come on, Lori, wake up!

01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:45.365
Lori, please. Wake up!

01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:46.950
Lori, please.
Lori, please.

01:12:53.123 --> 01:12:54.082
Go! Go, go, go!

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.212
Lori!

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.260
Oh, you fuckin' asshole!

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.386
Goddamn it!

01:13:10.224 --> 01:13:13.185
Welcome to my world, bitch.

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:17.856
I should warn you, princess...

01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:20.484
the first time tends
to get a little...

01:13:21.568 --> 01:13:23.612
messy.

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:40.963
Get away from her!

01:13:48.178 --> 01:13:49.054
Linderman.

01:13:55.853 --> 01:13:57.062
Oh! Oh, no!

01:14:04.486 --> 01:14:07.030
Die, you little bitch.

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:01.543
Jesus, Linderman.
You--you're really hurt.

01:15:01.543 --> 01:15:03.337
No. No, no, no.
Don't worry about me.

01:15:03.337 --> 01:15:04.421
Just a scratch.

01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:05.506
Just go get help, OK?

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:07.508
What? You don't think--

01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:09.343
Look, I'm just gonna
rest here a minute.

01:15:09.343 --> 01:15:11.512
-Linderman--
-I'm fine, Kia.

01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:12.846
Really.
Now get out of here.

01:15:12.846 --> 01:15:14.264
-Go get help.
-But you--

01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:15.766
Just go.

01:15:16.809 --> 01:15:20.187
OK, but I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can.

01:15:58.517 --> 01:15:59.726
Lori!

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:02.020
Think you're so smart,
huh, bitch?

01:16:03.438 --> 01:16:04.690
Freddy!

01:16:13.866 --> 01:16:15.868
How sweet...

01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:17.744
dark meat.

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:20.581
-No! Kia!
-Let's go!

01:16:20.581 --> 01:16:21.915
Nooo!

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.293
So you're the one
everyone's afraid of?

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.338
Tell me something.

01:16:28.422 --> 01:16:30.048
What kind of faggot...

01:16:30.132 --> 01:16:32.593
runs around
in a Christmas sweater?

01:16:33.927 --> 01:16:36.180
I mean, come on. Get real.

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.764
You're not even scary.

01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:39.475
You're not even scary.

01:16:39.516 --> 01:16:43.228
And let's talk about
the butter knives.

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.980
What is with the butter knives?

01:16:45.022 --> 01:16:48.025
You trying to compensate
for something?

01:16:48.066 --> 01:16:49.443
Maybe coming up
a little short there...

01:16:49.443 --> 01:16:52.404
between the legs,
Mr. Krueger?

01:16:52.488 --> 01:16:53.530
Hmm.

01:16:53.572 --> 01:16:57.034
I mean, you got these
teensy-weensy little things...

01:16:57.034 --> 01:17:02.247
and Jason has got this
big ol' thing that's like...

01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:11.840
Kia!

01:17:11.882 --> 01:17:13.675
-No! No!
-Come on!

01:17:18.889 --> 01:17:19.848
Come on, Lori.
Let's go.

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:20.849
We can't help her anymore.

01:17:20.933 --> 01:17:22.434
No! I'm staying!

01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:24.937
Are you crazy?
You got what you wanted.

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.772
You pulled Freddy out,
and now he's fighting Jason.

01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:27.981
Come on!
What more do you want?

01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:29.733
He killed my mother, Will!

01:17:29.858 --> 01:17:31.068
It was Freddy.

01:17:31.193 --> 01:17:33.403
My dad covered it up
to protect me.

01:17:33.403 --> 01:17:34.404
He didn't do it.

01:17:34.404 --> 01:17:35.781
Look, he has taken
everything from us!

01:17:35.906 --> 01:17:38.158
He has ruined
both of our pasts...

01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:41.370
and I am not leaving
until I see him die!

01:18:08.981 --> 01:18:10.649
Man the torpedoes.

01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:35.424
Hey, asshole!

01:18:36.884 --> 01:18:38.385
Up here!

01:18:44.808 --> 01:18:46.435
Aha!

01:19:02.951 --> 01:19:04.203
Yeah.

01:19:14.463 --> 01:19:16.215
Ah, give me a break.

01:19:40.906 --> 01:19:42.241
Oh, no.

01:19:42.366 --> 01:19:46.119
Ohh, noooo!

01:21:06.742 --> 01:21:08.660
Lori, get the tanks!

01:21:12.164 --> 01:21:13.457
Give it up!

01:21:39.608 --> 01:21:41.109
Freddy!

01:21:42.611 --> 01:21:43.904
Go to hell!

01:23:28.509 --> 01:23:30.385
It's OK. It's OK.

01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:02.084
You...

01:24:32.614 --> 01:24:35.409
Welcome to my world, bitch!
