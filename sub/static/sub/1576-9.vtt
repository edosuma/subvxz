<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> two and a half men...

00:03.304 --> 00:05.671
I'm not gay.
Does alan know?

00:05.673 --> 00:07.673
Can we kiss again?
Yeah.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.441
Do you want to go up to my...
Let's go.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.377
Oh...

00:11.379 --> 00:14.146
Louis:
Walden, can you come here?

00:14.148 --> 00:15.714
It's fine.
I-I've waited for two years.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.416
I can wait a little bit longer.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.685
Walden?

00:22.889 --> 00:26.925
Parenting rule number four:
Sleep is better than sex.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.295
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª
all right, louis,

00:30.297 --> 00:32.197
Let's go over
the rules again.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.832
We don't talk to strangers.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.634
Don't climb the rock wall alone.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.703
And?

00:37.705 --> 00:40.806
We don't eat anything
we find in the ball pit.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.207
All right, now,
go have fun.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.375
(squeals)

00:43.377 --> 00:44.576
All right, alan,

00:44.578 --> 00:46.378
Let's go over your rules.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.981
Uh, if I find a wallet,
I have to turn it in.

00:48.983 --> 00:52.017
Uh, no haggling
over the corn dog prices.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.552
And?

00:54.754 --> 00:56.655
No standing underneath the moms

00:56.657 --> 00:58.424
On the rock wall.
The rock wall. Yes.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.926
Oh, great.

01:00.928 --> 01:01.827
What?

01:01.829 --> 01:03.228
Laurel's here.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.396
Alan:
Oh.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.365
So go talk to her.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.233
What am I supposed to say?
"I'm sorry about our date.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.169
"it's just that I prefer
sleeping with a six-year-old kid

01:10.171 --> 01:11.737
To sleeping with you."

01:11.739 --> 01:14.807
Oh, oh, it's okay. I'm-I'm
talking about my own son.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.444
You know,
maybe I'll just avoid her.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.080
If I wanted to avoid every woman
I ever embarrassed myself

01:21.082 --> 01:22.881
In front of,
I'd never leave the house.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.384
I'd even have to steer clear
of the ups lady.

01:25.386 --> 01:28.287
She looked in the window
and caught me...

01:28.289 --> 01:30.622
Handling my own package.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.225
You know,
it's not the things that you do,

01:33.227 --> 01:35.360
So much as the way
that you say them.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.862
No, no.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.231
It-it's also the things
that you do.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.433
Okay, you know,
I just wish there was a way

01:41.435 --> 01:42.601
To, like,
jump over the awkwardness

01:42.603 --> 01:44.703
And get right
into the conversation with her.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.472
You know what, I think I can...
I can help you with that.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.539
Laurel!

01:49.876 --> 01:51.977
Look who's here! And awake!

01:51.979 --> 01:53.312
Hey, guys.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.747
I'll, uh... I'll leave
you two lovebirds alone.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.316
I'm gonna go check on louis.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.885
Hey, remember how we used
to have to pretend to be gay?

01:59.887 --> 02:03.055
Crazy, right?
(chuckles)

02:04.958 --> 02:06.892
I'm sorry I didn't call.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.393
And I'm-I'm sorry

02:08.395 --> 02:11.330
I fell asleep instead
of having sex with you. I...

02:11.332 --> 02:14.833
Will you stop
walking by?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.969
I really am sorry.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.403
I'm not mad.

02:18.405 --> 02:21.840
Though you are now in my phone
as rip van walden.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.543
I'm sorry, what was that?
I just nodded off.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.480
So, what you been up to?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.482
Oh, you know, not much. Just...

02:30.484 --> 02:32.084
Training for a marathon,

02:32.086 --> 02:34.319
Developing an international
photo sharing app,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.421
And I'm writing
a young adult novel.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.356
Wow. Really?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.024
No, I have a six-year-old.

02:39.026 --> 02:43.428
All I do is come here
and eat food on a stick.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.831
Well, do you want to... Maybe...

02:45.833 --> 02:48.000
Schedule another playdate?

02:48.002 --> 02:49.334
I would love that.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.503
I mean, lily would love that.
Oh.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.472
Louis would also love it.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.606
Imagine

02:54.608 --> 02:56.008
All the... Games

02:56.010 --> 02:57.509
That they would play together.

02:57.511 --> 03:01.280
Yeah. And all the, uh, toys
they would play with.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.049
Toys? I-I hope none
of them are...

03:04.051 --> 03:06.151
A choking hazard.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.387
Wouldn't matter to me.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.223
I don't have a gag reflex.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.693
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

03:14.695 --> 03:18.530
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

03:21.801 --> 03:24.503
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

03:24.505 --> 03:25.837
Morning.
(groans)

03:25.839 --> 03:27.339
How's the neck?

03:27.341 --> 03:28.907
Not good.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.509
Yeah. Well, I told you not
to stand under that mom

03:30.511 --> 03:31.944
On the rock wall.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.181
That's why we have rules!

03:36.183 --> 03:38.750
Yeah, well, wearing underwear
on the rock wall

03:38.752 --> 03:42.221
Should be one of those.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.723
Hey, louis, are you excited
about your playdate with lily?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.024
I guess.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.659
"I guess."

03:49.395 --> 03:51.563
You got a cute girl
coming over here.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.265
You should be
popping in the...

03:53.267 --> 03:57.436
<i>Kidz bop slow jamz</i>
<i>and putting some sunny d on ice.</i>

03:57.438 --> 03:59.705
Do I have to share my legos
with her?

03:59.707 --> 04:03.242
Of course not. It's a playdate.
You're not marrying her.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.443
Alan.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.412
Yes, we should share
everything we can--

04:07.414 --> 04:09.581
Our toys, our books, our...

04:09.583 --> 04:10.949
Sausage links.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.551
Alan:
If I could move

04:12.553 --> 04:15.387
My neck, I'd give you such
a look right now.

04:15.389 --> 04:18.357
The lesson is
that we should all share.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.859
Okay. I got to poop.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.595
Whoa! Whoa, what are you doing?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.564
Sharing.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.566
No. No, that's taking!

04:27.568 --> 04:30.736
That's my job in this house!

04:30.738 --> 04:32.471
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

04:32.473 --> 04:33.639
So what's the deal?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.741
Pinched nerve?
Slipped disk?

04:35.743 --> 04:38.744
The official diagnosis?
You're old.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.380
Very funny. I'd like
a second opinion.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.949
All right,
you're also out of shape.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.984
Come on, I'm in decent shape
for my age.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.319
Eh...

04:48.488 --> 04:50.322
Look, alan, when you get
to be our age,

04:50.324 --> 04:51.490
You get a little more fragile.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.991
You-you don't
bounce back as easily.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.893
The only thing
that bounces back is that belly

04:54.895 --> 04:56.895
When I poke it.
(chuckles)

04:56.897 --> 04:58.597
Stop it.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.732
I used to be
in the same boat as you.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.334
Then I found
this awesome new gym,

05:02.336 --> 05:04.136
Put myself
on a regular workout program.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.605
Now I'm in the best shape
of my life.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.307
Surprised you didn't notice.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.275
Oh. Oh, yeah.
You, uh... You look great.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.445
It's too late, alan.
The damage has been done.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.113
You should come down
and work out with me.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.848
It's, uh, nothing
but hot women in yoga pants

05:16.850 --> 05:18.517
As far as the eye can see.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.852
Sure, it's a little creepy
if you look right at 'em,

05:20.854 --> 05:24.189
But, uh, there are mirrors
everywhere.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.791
Yeah. I guess I could break out

05:25.793 --> 05:28.260
The old headband
and leg warmers.

05:28.262 --> 05:30.329
Great. Hey, uh,
since I got you here,

05:30.331 --> 05:33.098
It's, uh... It's been a year
since your last prostate exam.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.666
Oh, no.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.536
If it makes you feel any better,
you get a lollipop afterwards.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.439
Well, I've done a lot more
for a lot less.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.211
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

05:49.048 --> 05:51.516
Aw.
Aw.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.352
It's like the eye
of a hurricane.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.953
It's eerily quiet now,
but in an hour

05:54.955 --> 05:58.056
Everything will be broken
and wet.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.993
Well, at least I'm not the
only one who falls asleep

06:01.995 --> 06:04.529
When cute girls
are around.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.666
Aw. Thanks so much
for having us.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.734
I'm very impressed
with this spread.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.570
What kind of cheese is this?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.372
Uh...

06:13.374 --> 06:15.474
Okay, I have to confess.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.576
They're lunchables.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.045
That's the yellow cheese,

06:20.047 --> 06:23.148
But I also have the orange
and the white.

06:23.150 --> 06:27.052
No. No, thanks. I'm gonna save
room for the fruit roll-up.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.054
So tell me,

06:29.056 --> 06:31.723
How is it that a guy like you
is not already married

06:31.725 --> 06:34.726
To some-- I don't know--
gorgeous swimsuit model?

06:34.728 --> 06:38.597
Okay, you obviously haven't seen
alan in a speedo.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.599
I'm-I'm serious.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.535
You're sweet, you're
good-looking, you're successful.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.604
What the hell is wrong with you?

06:45.606 --> 06:49.040
Okay. I've been told...

06:49.042 --> 06:51.643
That I listen too much.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.046
Which is a common problem

06:55.048 --> 06:57.616
Among men
whose penises are too large.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.584
(snorts)

06:59.586 --> 07:02.587
Uh, well, I-I also have this...

07:02.589 --> 07:05.924
This teeny, tiny quirk
where, uh,

07:05.926 --> 07:09.561
I screw up relationships as soon
as they start going well.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.197
Oh. That's encouraging.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.065
Oh, oh. No, no, no.
But don't worry, uh,

07:14.067 --> 07:15.901
'cause this isn't going well
at all.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.303
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that

07:18.305 --> 07:21.306
'cause... I was
about to leave.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.376
Oh.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.211
Mmm, okay.
That-that kind of behavior

07:26.213 --> 07:27.779
Can get you put in time-out.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.450
(chuckles)
time-outs don't work on me.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.819
I need to be spanked.

07:37.323 --> 07:38.657
(chuckles)

07:38.659 --> 07:42.160
Looks like someone needs
to be sent to my room.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.835
Wow. Look at the lululemons
on her.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.504
Did I tell you
or did I tell you?

07:52.506 --> 07:53.772
Yeah.
Be cool, though.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.774
Getting tagged as a lurker
is a hard label to shake.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.642
So I've heard.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.144
Oh, oh, check
out the redhead.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.912
Her shorts say "juicy."

08:00.914 --> 08:02.747
If our garments
are being honest,

08:02.749 --> 08:05.016
Mine would
say "aroused."
(chuckles)

08:05.018 --> 08:07.652
Ooh, look at the blonde
on the yoga ball.
Mmm,

08:07.654 --> 08:10.489
Bouncy, bouncy,
bouncy...

08:10.491 --> 08:12.023
Lyndsey?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.492
Alan.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.826
How did I not recognize her?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.195
I've got to look
at more faces.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.763
I didn't know
you were a member here.

08:19.632 --> 08:20.765
Herb.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.501
I see they've reinstated
your membership.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.669
The appeals process
was arduous,

08:24.671 --> 08:27.506
But, ultimately,
justice was served.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.207
So, uh, how's everything?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.809
Good. I'm sober again.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.310
I traded booze for exercise.

08:32.312 --> 08:35.480
You know, whenever I want a
drink, I come here instead.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.949
Good thing this place
is open 24 hours.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.285
Well, I'm really happy for you.
You look great.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.821
I also think
you look great.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.656
In fact,
as a medical professional,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.691
My opinion is "wowza."

08:46.693 --> 08:48.960
Thanks. Anyway, I got to go.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.896
It's time for my spin class.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.731
Oh, so, uh...
So you went from a-a room

08:52.733 --> 08:55.834
That was spinning
to a room for spinning.

08:55.836 --> 08:56.968
(chuckles)

08:56.970 --> 08:58.703
You know... Glug,
glug, glug, glug.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.173
(dizzy, retching sounds)

09:02.175 --> 09:03.475
(chuckles)

09:03.477 --> 09:04.709
Anyway, great seeing you.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.378
Yeah.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.847
I missed this.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.415
Wow, she looks amazing.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.183
Did you see how flat
her stomach is?

09:12.185 --> 09:14.019
She's always had great abs.
All that dry heaving

09:14.021 --> 09:15.687
Gives you a hell
of a six-pack.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.689
So, uh, you two are over?

09:17.691 --> 09:20.058
Oh, yeah. You know,
it's complicated with me

09:20.060 --> 09:21.893
And walden and louis.
Plus, you know, I don't know

09:21.895 --> 09:24.696
That lyndsey and I were
ever really good for each other.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.731
Kind of like me and lactose.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.066
That's too bad.
Mmm.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.901
Mind if I take a crack at her?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.102
What?

09:31.104 --> 09:32.537
You two aren't together anymore.

09:32.539 --> 09:36.908
Maybe the cure for what ails her
is a little herb-al essence.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.244
Dude, you already married
my ex-wife,

09:39.246 --> 09:41.446
You moved into my house,
and earlier today

09:41.448 --> 09:43.148
You had your finger halfway
to my liver.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.051
Maybe we share enough as it is.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.219
Okay, I get it. Bro code.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.688
Thank you.

09:49.690 --> 09:53.758
Just so you know, that exam
was no picnic for me, either.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.430
(moaning softly)

09:58.432 --> 10:00.031
Did you hear that?

10:00.033 --> 10:02.300
I think it was the
kids downstairs.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.102
What kids?
(chuckles)

10:04.104 --> 10:05.604
Oh.
(chuckles)

10:05.606 --> 10:07.872
You're right.
It was probably nothing.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.641
(grunting)

10:12.144 --> 10:15.246
Oh, wait. What if one of them
walks in on us?

10:15.248 --> 10:16.982
I had a hard enough time
explaining

10:16.984 --> 10:18.450
Where milk comes from.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.652
Do you want to lock the door?

10:20.654 --> 10:22.721
Yes.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.093
(chuckles)

10:28.095 --> 10:31.129
Mmm. Oh, no, no, no.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.597
What if there's an emergency?

10:32.599 --> 10:33.832
What if they need
to come get us?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.934
What-what... What if
there's a burglar or a fire,

10:35.936 --> 10:38.503
Or a burglar who sets a fire
as a distraction?

10:38.505 --> 10:39.838
Oh, no, no.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.939
(laughs)

10:40.941 --> 10:43.241
Not on my watch!

10:43.243 --> 10:45.310
Oh, my god, you're adorable.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.612
But if you can't stop worrying
all the time,

10:47.614 --> 10:49.981
You're never gonna
have sex again.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.050
Oh, my god.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.854
I'm never gonna have sex again.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.023
You're used
to single-people sex.

10:58.025 --> 11:01.593
That's a luxurious four-course
meal at a fine restaurant.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.962
Parent sex is a drive-through.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.597
Get in, get out,

11:05.599 --> 11:08.033
Hope you don't get anything
on your shirt.
Oh.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.769
Looks like your order
just got supersized.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.604
(laughs)

11:12.606 --> 11:15.840
(moaning)

11:15.842 --> 11:17.275
Louis:
Walden?

11:17.277 --> 11:19.778
Yes! Coming! Right there!

11:19.780 --> 11:21.846
Oh, god, are you okay?

11:21.848 --> 11:25.684
I'm fine. Good news is,
you finally got my bra off.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.886
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:31.157 --> 11:32.624
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:32.626 --> 11:33.958
Morning.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.694
Morning. Where's louis?

11:35.696 --> 11:37.128
I sent him to take a bath.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.898
Oh, by the way, if you want
syrup on your french toast,

11:39.900 --> 11:41.666
Catch him before
he hits the water.

11:41.668 --> 11:42.967
No. No french toast for me.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.869
I'm hitting the gym
a little later.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.640
Oh, uh, by the way,
the beach is that way.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.476
Oh, look at that.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.813
Uh, my fitness band says
that my pulse rate is 87.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.582
Tell me when it
gets to zero.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.017
Yeah, joke all you want,

11:59.019 --> 12:01.653
But this little gizmo tracks
all my physical activity.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.889
So far today, I have burned...
400 calories.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.524
Oh, wow. Did you go for a run?

12:06.526 --> 12:07.992
Nope, never left my bed.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.328
Oh, come on!

12:10.330 --> 12:12.897
So, how was your playdate
with laurel?

12:12.899 --> 12:16.167
Okay, let-let me...
Let me ask you guys something.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.404
When you had young kids, and
they were still in the house,

12:19.406 --> 12:23.074
Did you have a hard time,
like... You know...

12:23.076 --> 12:26.544
â™ª bow chicka wow wow?

12:26.546 --> 12:30.115
Oh. Oh, well, jake walked in on
judith and me countless times.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.484
Eventually, we stopped
having sex altogether.

12:33.953 --> 12:36.054
Those aren't related.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.689
I just...
I don't know what to do.

12:37.691 --> 12:41.059
It's like, louis is stealing
your sausage and blocking mine.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.061
Well, sooner or later,
you just get over it.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.196
Uh, but in the meantime,
why don't you take her out

12:45.198 --> 12:47.098
For a romantic night to a hotel?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.768
Oh. I like that.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.770
Plus, people do all kinds
of things in hotels

12:51.772 --> 12:53.104
They don't do at home.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.707
Like pay eight dollars
for peanuts.

12:55.709 --> 12:59.043
I used to love
to have sex in hotel rooms.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.012
Then they caught me,
and they fired me.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.017
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

13:14.393 --> 13:16.928
Do you want to work in?

13:16.930 --> 13:17.996
What?

13:19.098 --> 13:20.665
Oh, oh, uh, work in, yeah.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.100
Uh, definitely want to work in.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.935
Why else would I be
sitting here?

13:23.937 --> 13:26.070
Thanks. (laughs)
no problem.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.109
Just, uh, show you
the proper technique.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.578
Mm.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.480
Here we go. (sighs)

13:35.482 --> 13:37.048
(laughs)

13:38.017 --> 13:40.251
(grunting)

13:41.787 --> 13:43.254
<i>Aah!</i> Oh, aah.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.156
Bum shoulder. Yeah.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.259
Got it the last iron man.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.995
The movie, not the triathlon.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.331
I slipped in the lobby
on some artificial butter.

13:53.333 --> 13:57.001
Oh.
There we go,
lighten the load, and, uh...

13:57.003 --> 13:58.503
One time, here we go.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.572
(laughs)

14:03.809 --> 14:06.110
(groaning)

14:06.112 --> 14:07.545
(passes gas)

14:07.547 --> 14:09.180
Oh, god!

14:12.117 --> 14:14.519
Nice meeting you!

14:15.454 --> 14:16.855
Hey, alan.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.289
Oh. Oh, hey,
lyndsey. Oh, hey.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.624
Yeah, I was just, uh...

14:19.626 --> 14:21.226
I was just doing the,
uh, the fly machine.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.228
You know, working out.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.063
You're really committing
to this workout thing.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.197
I'm impressed.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.000
I know. I haven't been anyplace
two days in a row

14:29.002 --> 14:30.969
Since <i>jersey boys</i> was touring.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.872
Where's herb?
Uh, in the office.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.207
He got all excited about
an outbreak of pinkeye.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.676
When kids see pink,
herb sees green.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.911
Well, tell him I said "hi."

14:39.913 --> 14:41.145
Oh, I don't know

14:41.147 --> 14:42.680
If that's such
a great idea.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.681
What do you mean?

14:43.683 --> 14:45.316
Well, get this.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.085
Uh, after we saw you
the other day,

14:47.087 --> 14:50.054
He wanted to know
if it was okay to ask you out.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.190
But don't worry. I told him no.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.559
What?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.228
You have no right
to decide who I go out with.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.197
Oh, come on, lyndsey.
I mean, how would you feel

14:59.199 --> 15:01.199
If one of your friends wanted
to go out with me?

15:01.201 --> 15:05.436
Shocked, stunned,
like I need new friends.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.071
Look, I am just trying to help.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.406
You just got sober.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.241
I mean, before you move
onto somebody else,

15:10.243 --> 15:12.043
You should probably
get over your breakup

15:12.045 --> 15:13.211
With captain morgan.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.612
Are you freaking kidding me?!

15:14.614 --> 15:17.181
If I want to go out with herb,
it is none of your business.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.584
In fact, nothing I do
is any of your business!

15:19.586 --> 15:21.586
Just stay the hell
out of my life!

15:25.057 --> 15:26.791
Roid rage.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.793
(laughs)

15:28.795 --> 15:30.862
Phew.

15:33.198 --> 15:35.233
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

15:35.235 --> 15:38.303
(laughing):
Okay.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.972
This was officially
a great idea.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.074
Did you like the way
I checked us in?

15:43.076 --> 15:45.710
Mr. And mrs. R. Doinit?

15:45.712 --> 15:48.313
Um, I like to go
by my maiden name--

15:48.315 --> 15:49.914
Gettin' some.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.983
Hey, check this out.

15:52.918 --> 15:54.485
(laughs)

15:54.487 --> 15:57.488
I just walked across the floor
without stepping on a lego.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.957
(gasps)

15:58.959 --> 16:00.591
Look, there's chocolate
on the pillows,

16:00.593 --> 16:02.760
And it's not even in the shape
of a handprint.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.263
Oh. Get over
here, woman.
Uh-uh.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.298
No, no. I've got
a surprise for you.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.800
A surprise?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.134
Mm-hmm.
Yay! What is it?

16:10.136 --> 16:11.736
Oh, I'll give you a hint.

16:11.738 --> 16:17.408
It's lacy, it's new, and you get
to bite the tags off.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.444
If it's big enough
to have tags on it,

16:19.446 --> 16:20.712
I already don't like it.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.582
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

16:24.584 --> 16:27.318
(doorbell ringing)

16:27.320 --> 16:30.421
Alan, what are you doing here?

16:30.423 --> 16:33.291
Well, I felt bad about earlier,
and I wanted to apologize.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.325
These are for you.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.394
For me, huh?

16:38.597 --> 16:41.165
"mr. Schmidt, thank you so much
for your generous donation

16:41.167 --> 16:43.001
To the children's hospital."

16:43.003 --> 16:45.403
Um, I-I did not see that.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.539
Herb:
Is that the pizza guy?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.145
Herb?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.513
Alan, what are you doing here?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.649
What are you doing here, and...
And why are you wearing my robe?

16:58.651 --> 17:01.452
I'll let you guys talk.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.856
Alan, you showing up here
is the second best thing

17:04.858 --> 17:07.759
That's happened to me today.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.329
What the hell, herb?

17:11.331 --> 17:14.165
Believe me, I had no intention
of going behind your back,

17:14.167 --> 17:16.367
But out of nowhere, lyndsey
invited me over for dinner,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.369
And I thought,
"what's the harm?"

17:18.371 --> 17:19.704
Well, then, dinner
turned into dessert,

17:19.706 --> 17:23.975
And dessert turned into,
well, sex with lyndsey.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.543
This hurts, herb.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.245
Yesterday you were
tickling my prostate,

17:27.247 --> 17:29.313
And today you're
stabbing me in the back.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.648
Hey, it's your fault.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.083
You made me forbidden fruit.

17:32.085 --> 17:37.055
I was off-limits,
like dancing in <i>footloose.</i>

17:37.057 --> 17:39.257
Look, I'm sorry
it happened like this.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.492
And, well, if you want me
to stop seeing her,

17:41.494 --> 17:43.494
Just say the word,
and it's over.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.729
Lyndsey:
Herb?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.130
Well, you had your chance.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.074
What do you think?

17:56.076 --> 17:57.942
It's horrible. Take it off.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.243
(laughs)

18:00.212 --> 18:02.513
Oh!
Ooh!

18:04.249 --> 18:06.050
(phone chirps)

18:06.052 --> 18:08.286
No!
(laughs)

18:08.288 --> 18:09.587
It's okay. Get it.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.522
(sighs)

18:13.058 --> 18:14.759
Okay, babysitter wants to know

18:14.761 --> 18:17.695
If lily can have ice cream
for dessert.
(laughs)

18:17.697 --> 18:21.265
"don't care. Getting laid."

18:21.267 --> 18:22.600
(mutters)

18:22.602 --> 18:24.302
No, I just wrote "yes."

18:24.304 --> 18:25.636
(laughter)

18:25.638 --> 18:28.739
Oh, hey, you know, next time, we
should just get one babysitter,

18:28.741 --> 18:32.110
And then louis can sleep
over with lily at my house,

18:32.112 --> 18:35.113
And I can sleep over
with you at your house.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.181
Yeah, maybe.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.284
Wait, wait,
whoa, hold on.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.587
Do you not want there
to be a next time?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.922
I mean, please
reserve your judgment

18:44.924 --> 18:46.290
Until after the
first time.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.493
(laughs)
I rarely

18:48.495 --> 18:51.295
Disappoint a woman sexually
before we have sex.

18:51.297 --> 18:55.633
No, it's just...
All kids have their differences.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.003
But I don't want to talk
about louis and lily right now.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.339
In fact, I don't want
to talk at all.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.975
I got better things
to do with my mouth.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.245
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Hold on.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.313
Wait. Louis and lily
don't get along?

19:09.315 --> 19:10.448
Well, you know how kids are.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.583
One week, they like each other;
the next, they don't.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.685
So louis doesn't like to share.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.487
Lucky for you, I do.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.923
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.525
Louis does not have
a problem sharing.

19:20.527 --> 19:24.362
In fact, I just talked to him
specifically about sharing.

19:24.364 --> 19:27.431
I'm sorry. Lily must
have made it up.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.934
That's probably it. Okay.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.335
Wait a second.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.372
So you're okay
with saying that lily's a liar,

19:34.374 --> 19:36.440
But you can't admit
that louis has issues?

19:36.442 --> 19:38.476
(laughs)
oh. Okay, hold on.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.012
I think I would know
if my son has issues.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.547
Right, 'cause
you've been a parent

19:42.549 --> 19:43.814
For all of, what, two weeks?

19:43.816 --> 19:47.051
Two and a half.
(sighs)

19:47.053 --> 19:48.686
And fancy you
lecturing me.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.454
The mother of
lily the biter.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.456
What? Lily's not a biter.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.026
All the other parents
call her "lily-goat."

19:55.028 --> 19:57.395
You know what?
This was a bad idea.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.230
Oh, yeah, it was...

19:59.232 --> 20:01.365
(bleating):
Baa-aa-aa-aa-aad.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.601
That was a sheep.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.371
And if this is how
you talk to women in bed,

20:07.373 --> 20:09.473
Then no wonder
you had to marry alan.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.643
(gasps)
you will leave my husband
out of this!

20:12.645 --> 20:15.079
You don't even know
what you're missing.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.748
You were about to have
the hottest sex of your life!

20:17.750 --> 20:19.350
Oh, oh, easy for you to say

20:19.352 --> 20:20.985
Since you don't have
to back it up.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.521
Oh, you want me to back it up?!
'cause I'll back it up!

20:23.523 --> 20:25.489
Yeah, back it on up!

20:25.491 --> 20:26.691
Oh, what, are we gonna have sex?

20:26.693 --> 20:28.559
Shut up!
Oh...

20:28.561 --> 20:30.261
(yelps, chuckles)

20:30.263 --> 20:32.563
Okay, I see where lily
gets her biting.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.036
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:39.038 --> 20:42.039
Boy, I was angrier
than I thought.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.674
(exhales)

20:43.676 --> 20:47.445
Boy, I was angrier
than I thought.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.513
(panting)

20:51.183 --> 20:54.252
Boy, I was angrier
than I thought.
