WEBVTT

00:10.078 --> 00:11.245
- Uh, excuse me?

00:11.345 --> 00:13.781
Ma'am, you're in
the wrong house.

00:13.881 --> 00:14.982
- Ha. Ha.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.985
Your Mom suggested I treat
myself for my birthday.

00:18.086 --> 00:21.589
- So, you bought
yourself a skirt?

00:21.689 --> 00:24.192
- Your father's gonna play
a round of golf in Scotland

00:24.292 --> 00:26.627
and the kilt
is traditional dress.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.129
- Hm, traditionally,
you should shave your legs

00:28.229 --> 00:30.564
before you wear a dress.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.367
- What the kids mean
to say is...

00:33.467 --> 00:35.636
- ALL: Happy Birthday, Dad!

00:35.736 --> 00:39.773
- Aw, it means so much to me
that your Mom made you say it.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.610
Well, I'd better get going
so I don't miss my tee time.

00:42.710 --> 00:46.480
Thunderman, away!
- [loud thud]

00:46.580 --> 00:50.351
- Man skirt!
Nobody look up!

00:52.153 --> 00:53.954
- *

00:54.054 --> 00:55.256
* What you see

00:55.356 --> 00:57.225
* Is not what you get

00:57.325 --> 01:00.461
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

01:00.561 --> 01:02.196
* We fit right in

01:02.296 --> 01:03.664
* Bet you never guessed

01:03.764 --> 01:05.199
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

01:05.299 --> 01:07.000
* Just like all the rest

01:07.135 --> 01:08.536
* A picture
perfect family *

01:08.636 --> 01:10.638
* Is what we try to be

01:10.738 --> 01:12.039
* Look closer,
you might see *

01:12.140 --> 01:13.641
* The crazy things we do

01:13.741 --> 01:15.343
* This isn't
make believe *

01:15.443 --> 01:17.145
* It's our reality

01:17.211 --> 01:18.579
* Just your average family

01:18.679 --> 01:21.615
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

01:21.715 --> 01:25.486
* Livin' a double life

01:28.689 --> 01:31.659
- *

01:31.759 --> 01:33.827
- Okay, your Dad's
gonna be gone all day.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.230
That gives us time to set up
the perfect party

01:36.330 --> 01:37.965
and make up for last year.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.368
- HANK: [groaning]

01:40.468 --> 01:42.370
- I'm sorry, Hank.

01:42.470 --> 01:47.341
I thought fish was
supposed to smell like this.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.077
- ALL: [sadly]
Happy Birthday, Dad...

01:50.178 --> 01:51.645
- [ambulance siren wailing]

01:51.745 --> 01:52.946
- I know this
is kind of weird,

01:53.046 --> 01:56.184
but I really want
fish sticks right now.

01:56.217 --> 01:59.052
- Don't worry, Mom. Max and I
wanna do our part this year.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.422
- Yeah, I guess the big guy
does deserve one birthday

02:01.522 --> 02:03.857
that doesn't end up
on a stretcher.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.859
- Billy, Nora and I
will handle the cake,

02:05.959 --> 02:07.595
gift-wrapping
and decorations.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.497
- I'll blow up
the rubber bubbles.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.764
- Don't you mean balloons?

02:10.864 --> 02:12.700
- Balloons!
[zooming]

02:12.800 --> 02:14.535
- All I need from you two

02:14.635 --> 02:16.804
is to pick up your Dad's
birthday watch at the mall.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.606
- That's it?
- Zip it, Phoebe.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.508
They have three things to do.
We only have one.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.376
- And don't get
distracted at the mall.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.011
Be back as soon as you can

02:24.111 --> 02:26.247
and remember the party's
a surprise.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.016
- [zooming]
Surprise!

02:29.116 --> 02:32.653
- Whose turn is it
to explain things to Billy?

02:32.753 --> 02:36.324
- Looks like I'm up.
See you guys in a few hours.

02:36.424 --> 02:42.363
- *

02:42.463 --> 02:43.764
- So, that was
women's perfume

02:43.864 --> 02:45.733
that girl sprayed you with.
[laughing]

02:45.833 --> 02:49.337
- Yeah, for the second time,
I realize that.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.804
- Well, at least
we got Dad's watch.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.840
- Yeah, with time to spare--

02:52.940 --> 02:54.775
which is why
I called Oyster.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.445
- What's up, dude?
- Hey!

02:57.545 --> 02:59.247
- OYSTER: [sniffing]

02:59.313 --> 03:01.982
You smell like my nana.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.952
- Well, then, your nana
smells great.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.254
- Max, I can't believe
you called Oyster

03:06.320 --> 03:08.656
when Mom wanted us home
as soon as possible.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.359
- Hey, Phoebe, got your text.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.126
- Texting's not calling.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.995
Besides, we know how
to navigate the mall.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.930
Guys get distracted
by the littlest--

03:17.030 --> 03:20.368
- MAX & OYSTER:
Ear Blasters!

03:20.468 --> 03:22.270
- Ear Blasters?

03:22.370 --> 03:24.472
- They're the most awesomest
headphones ever.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.973
- Yeah!

03:26.073 --> 03:27.841
They have 18-micro
speakers that use

03:27.941 --> 03:31.111
your eardrums as real drums.

03:31.279 --> 03:34.782
- Ten out of ten doctors
do not recommend 'em.

03:34.882 --> 03:38.786
- Ear Blasters are impossible
to find, but they're here.

03:38.886 --> 03:42.390
[hissing]
They're only $80.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.824
- Fine. Half an hour, Max.

03:43.924 --> 03:47.361
We can't be late
for Dad's party.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.430
- I cannot wait
to wear those

03:49.530 --> 03:52.933
so I cannot hear
her any more.

03:53.033 --> 03:56.003
- All right, we have
time for two stores,

03:56.103 --> 03:58.105
the food court
and the carousel.

03:58.205 --> 04:01.208
- Carousel?
- I'm just kidding.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.210
Unless you want to.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.045
- Okay, I want to!

04:05.145 --> 04:06.647
- Oh, great, Madison is here.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.749
That spoiled snob
is so fake.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.552
Hi, Madison!
- Hi, girls!

04:11.652 --> 04:14.622
- Hm...
- Mmm...

04:14.722 --> 04:16.089
- Is that a Sarah Finn bag?

04:16.189 --> 04:17.391
I didn't know they opened
a store here.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.927
- [laughing] Oh, sweetie,
of course you didn't.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.862
It's very high class.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.464
And you're more...

04:23.564 --> 04:25.198
gym class.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.701
I'm sure the Denim Dungeon's
having a sale.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.103
Hasta.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.473
- [scoffs] Well, we know
where we're going.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.041
- The carousel?
- Sarah Finn.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.443
No, Ashley, we have to
go to that store

04:35.543 --> 04:37.645
and prove to Madison that we're
just as good as she is.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.413
Then we'll go to the...

04:39.513 --> 04:41.248
carousel.
- Denim Dungeon?

04:41.349 --> 04:44.051
- Okay, we need to get
on the same page here.

04:48.556 --> 04:52.159
- I did it and it's not
upside down this time.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.563
- Good boy.
Who wants a treat?

04:55.663 --> 04:57.465
- Nora, we talked
about this.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.000
Billy is not a dog.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.135
- [panting, scratching]

05:02.235 --> 05:05.172
- Not helping, sweetie.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.541
You guys, the place
looks great.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.644
At this rate, we'll be done way
before your Dad gets home.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.746
- WOMAN ANNOUNCING:
Alert! Alert!

05:12.846 --> 05:14.715
Your Dad is home.
- BARB: [gasps]

05:14.815 --> 05:16.283
He's early!

05:16.384 --> 05:18.419
Oh, if he sees this,
the surprise will be ruined.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.720
Hide the decorations.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.722
- On it!

05:21.822 --> 05:23.924
[zooming]

05:26.794 --> 05:29.062
- Mom, the cake!
- Oh!

05:34.468 --> 05:36.904
- COLOSSO: Hey!
I'm covered in cake!

05:37.004 --> 05:39.673
[happily]
Hey, I'm covered in cake!

05:44.512 --> 05:46.113
- Hank, what happened?

05:46.213 --> 05:48.048
- They closed the course
due to bad weather

05:48.148 --> 05:50.451
and on the way home,
I was struck by lightning--

05:50.551 --> 05:52.119
twice!

05:52.219 --> 05:54.121
- I thought lightning doesn't
strike the same place twice.

05:54.221 --> 05:58.659
- Tell that to Dad's butt.
[laughing]

05:58.759 --> 06:00.728
- Y-You can't sit down.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.229
After a lightning strike,

06:02.329 --> 06:04.231
the last place you
should be is inside.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.667
- You mean where there
isn't lightning?

06:06.767 --> 06:09.202
- Well, it's just that you're
full of electricity.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.438
It's not safe for the kids.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.540
- Don't you want us
to be safe, Daddy?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.775
- Yeah, don't you love us?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.810
- Guys, relax.
I am perfectly--

06:16.910 --> 06:19.012
- BARB: [powers zapping]
- HANK: Whoa!

06:19.112 --> 06:20.280
Was that me?
- Yes. Yes.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.949
We should get you outside

06:22.049 --> 06:25.786
until the electricity
leaves your body.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.255
[quietly]
Put the decorations back.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.890
- On it.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.925
[zooming]

06:32.025 --> 06:33.761
Oops.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.466
- Right, one more dollar
and those Ear Blasters are mine.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.675
Why isn't this thing
taking my last dollar?

06:47.775 --> 06:50.177
- Because your face
is on it.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.279
- Oh, it's a Max Buck.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.682
Wonder why these things
never caught on?

06:54.782 --> 06:57.017
- Maybe because there's
a bunny on the back.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.186
- Here, spot me
a real dollar.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.988
- No can do, bro.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.289
I threw all my change
in that pond.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.492
I wished you'd get
those headphones.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.893
Oh, man, I said
it out loud.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.496
Now you're not
gonna get 'em.

07:10.297 --> 07:14.602
- Guard the machine.
I'll be right back.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.574
Heh, heh, it's like
stealing candy from a baby.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.915
Shhhh...

07:30.183 --> 07:37.725
- *

07:37.825 --> 07:39.326
- Check it out.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.661
I feel like royalty.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.163
- Phoebe, we can't afford
anything in this store.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.098
These socks are $300.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.600
Perfect!

07:46.700 --> 07:48.636
- Relax, I'm not
gonna buy this.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.437
We're just gonna try on
the nice clothes,

07:50.538 --> 07:53.006
hide the tags
and then take selfies.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.342
Here.
- [cellphone camera clicks]

07:55.442 --> 07:56.710
- Then we'll post
our glam pics

07:56.810 --> 07:59.613
and prove to Madison
she was wrong about us.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.349
Even though I have
worn this in gym class.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.657
- Hello?
[laughing]

08:09.757 --> 08:11.592
Sorry, we get this
all the time.

08:11.692 --> 08:15.563
The Denim Dungeon
has moved downstairs.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.264
This is a Sarah Finn
store now.

08:17.364 --> 08:21.034
I'll just hang these
back up for you.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.335
- That was rude.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.304
He doesn't know us.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.808
- You're right.
He doesn't.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.910
[fake British accent]
Pardon me, sir,

08:30.010 --> 08:32.279
but we are still
undecided about those garments.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.614
- Excuse me?

08:33.714 --> 08:39.352
- I am Lady Pipi Whiffenpouf
and this is...

08:39.452 --> 08:42.155
- [fake British accent]
Lady Gaga.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.925
No relation.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.228
- We are wealthy heiresses
from jolly old England.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.063
- Really?

08:50.163 --> 08:51.832
- But if we're
not welcome here,

08:51.932 --> 08:55.168
perhaps we should take
our business elsewhere.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.404
- Uh, don't be silly.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.040
Uh, London is
my favorite city.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.709
I love Piccadilly Circus.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.244
- Ah, well, then Piccadilly
us more outfits.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.913
- Right away.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.782
Uh, ladies, some treats
for our special guests.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.085
If you need anything
at all, just ask.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.387
Oh...
- Ah...

09:17.257 --> 09:20.293
- BOTH:
[excited squealing]

09:20.393 --> 09:22.395
- Lady Gaga?
- Lady Whiffleball.

09:22.495 --> 09:26.133
- Close enough. Woo!

09:26.233 --> 09:30.738
- [cellphone ringing]

09:30.838 --> 09:32.272
- I just sent two
teenagers to the mall.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.374
What was I thinking?

09:34.474 --> 09:37.010
I sent two kids
to bake a cake.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.113
What was I thinking?

09:40.213 --> 09:42.082
- HANK: Barb?

09:42.182 --> 09:44.251
Barb?

09:44.351 --> 09:46.954
- Yes, Hank?

09:47.054 --> 09:49.256
- How much longer do I have to
stand here in these tires?

09:49.356 --> 09:50.724
I look ridiculous.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.660
- Well, the rubber
is canceling out

09:52.726 --> 09:54.561
the electric current
in your body.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.263
- Yeah, but I'm so--

09:56.363 --> 09:58.031
- Uh! Uh! Uh!
Take it from Electriss--

09:58.131 --> 10:01.835
electrical charges are
no laughing matter.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.403
- Isn't that from one of your
old safety commercials

10:03.503 --> 10:05.305
back in Metroburg?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.606
- Take it from Electriss--

10:06.707 --> 10:09.376
electrical charges
are no laughing matter.

10:09.476 --> 10:13.013
Use your dome.
Protect your home.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.783
- MALE ANNOUNCING: Paid for

10:15.883 --> 10:20.120
- Just stay here until
Max and Phoebe get back.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.255
- Barb, wait,
don't go inside.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.391
- No, I don't think
you should--

10:24.491 --> 10:26.393
- HANK: Ahhhh!
- BARB: Hank?

10:26.493 --> 10:28.528
Oh!

10:28.628 --> 10:31.264
- Where am I going now?

10:31.364 --> 10:34.668
Help!
- Hank?

10:34.768 --> 10:37.104
- [car horn blaring]

10:37.204 --> 10:38.571
- If Dad's going
to the store,

10:38.672 --> 10:41.108
tell him we're
out of milk.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.316
- Fifty-five cents.
Over half way there.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.952
Oyster, how're you doin'?
- All good here.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.854
- Ear Blasters for
only a dollar?

10:53.954 --> 10:58.759
- Not good. Not good here.
You'd better hurry.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.962
- Are you stealing money?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.230
- No.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.198
I'm...

11:05.298 --> 11:06.734
the Wish Fairy

11:06.834 --> 11:08.268
and I'm just
collecting money

11:08.368 --> 11:10.738
to take it back
to Wishville.

11:10.771 --> 11:14.041
You got a wish?

11:14.141 --> 11:15.743
A penny, huh?

11:15.809 --> 11:18.746
A couple of quarters and your
wish goes on the fast track.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.580
- Thanks, Mr. Fairy.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.415
- Outta my Wish Pond, punk.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.317
- Take your hands
off the Wish Fairy.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.919
[kicks guard]
- Ow!

11:26.019 --> 11:27.654
- Thanks, kid.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.865
How are you doing that?

11:37.965 --> 11:41.168
- It's not a very big pond.
- Aw...

11:44.772 --> 11:46.673
- [clears throat]
- Why, thank you.

11:46.774 --> 11:50.010
Your dry and crumbly muffins
are surprisingly smashing.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.113
- They're scones and they
taste even better

11:53.213 --> 11:55.415
when you buy something.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.417
- All in good time,
old chap.

11:57.517 --> 12:01.855
- Or do you prefer gov'nor?

12:01.955 --> 12:05.692
- Come on, let's get a picture
with our fancy food.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.127
- What's a scone, anyway?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.963
- Who cares--as long as Madison
sees us eating it.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.664
- [cellphone camera clicks]

12:11.799 --> 12:13.600
- MAX: Let me go!
You're not even a real cop.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.804
- You've gotta
be kidding me.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.638
- Lady Whifflepouff, wait!

12:18.806 --> 12:22.275
- [store alarm wailing]

12:22.375 --> 12:24.511
- Stop her!

12:24.611 --> 12:28.315
- Ah!

12:28.415 --> 12:30.250
- What did you do, Max?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.584
- This girl is a thief.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.821
- What did you do, Phoebe?

12:33.887 --> 12:36.356
- She stole
a Sarah Finn vest.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.826
- No, no, I was just
coming to check on my brother.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.229
- Who also seems to be
in the family business.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.264
- Wait, my Dad's birthday watch
is still in the store.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.367
- Oh, did you lose your watch
like you lost your accent?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.974
- Oh, my "Gurd", Phoebe.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.743
Shoplift much?
- [cellphone camera clicks]

12:59.913 --> 13:01.714
- You two are banned
for life.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.884
- You can't do that!

13:06.854 --> 13:09.890
- [sighing] I can't
believe he did that.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.896
- We can't go home
empty-handed

13:15.996 --> 13:17.898
and ruin Dad's
birthday--again.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.933
Do you know how mad
Mom's gonna be?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.935
- [cellphone ringing]

13:22.035 --> 13:24.404
- Looks like we're about
to find out. Hey, Mom.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.406
- BARB ON PHONE: Where
are you guys?

13:26.506 --> 13:28.408
You were supposed to be
home an hour ago.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.878
- Yeah, I know we're late.
It's...

13:30.911 --> 13:32.045
Well, it's old Phoebe.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.014
- BARB: Get back here.
I'm not kidding around.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.748
- We'll be there.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.750
Phoebe's just gotta
do one more thing.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.286
- BARB: Tell Phoebe to--

13:39.386 --> 13:42.755
- Woo, she is not happy
with you.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.458
- Ashley, did you find my Dad's
watch in the Sarah Finn store?

13:45.558 --> 13:47.794
- No, I looked everywhere.
What else can I do?

13:47.895 --> 13:49.897
I'm all yours until
my Mom gets here.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.631
- Well, it would be
great if you could--

13:51.731 --> 13:54.001
- [cellphone musical tone]
- Oh, that's my Mom. Gotta go.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.006
- We've gotta get back inside
and get Dad's watch.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.545
- Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.780
- I'm never thinking
what you're thinking.

14:07.915 --> 14:12.219
- *

14:12.319 --> 14:14.287
- It took two hours
to make a cake

14:14.387 --> 14:16.723
that Dad's gonna eat
in two seconds.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.226
- So, what's next?

14:24.531 --> 14:26.799
- Looks like we have time to
wrap our gifts for Dad.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.636
- On it!
[zooming]

14:29.736 --> 14:31.371
[sighing]

14:31.471 --> 14:35.008
I no longer regret my summer
at gift wrapping camp.

14:35.108 --> 14:39.146
- Well, you're gonna.

14:39.246 --> 14:42.515
- They warned me at
camp there'd be haters!

14:42.615 --> 14:45.618
- NORA: [zapping]
- BILLY: Ah! Ah!

14:45.718 --> 14:52.792
- *

14:52.960 --> 14:56.263
- [bins thud]
- PHOEBE: [grunts]

14:59.266 --> 15:01.068
You're supposed
to be an evil genius

15:01.168 --> 15:03.070
and this is the best
you got?

15:03.170 --> 15:04.671
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:04.771 --> 15:08.675
Are you giving me 'tude
from outside or inside the mall?

15:08.775 --> 15:11.478
- KIDS: [shouting]
- Oh, no, Oyster's in trouble.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.546
- Forget him, Max.
We have to find Dad's watch.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.548
Oyster can take
care of himself.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.550
- [high-pitched]
Stay back! Stay back!

15:17.650 --> 15:20.753
Hold up, bro. You're not
touching this screen.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.124
Ha! Ha!

15:24.224 --> 15:25.825
Ugh!

15:25.993 --> 15:28.361
It tastes like the flu.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.998
- KIDS: [shouting]

15:31.098 --> 15:33.000
- See, I told you
Oyster's got it.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.568
- Oh, he's gonna
get something.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.604
- Come on, let's find
Dad's watch.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.907
- Oh, tell Jocelyn that
I'll be back in 15.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.310
I need a massage.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.016
Ooh...

15:49.116 --> 15:51.018
Hm...

15:54.454 --> 15:57.257
- I think Dad's watch
just found us.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.625
- [fake British accent]
My word!

15:58.725 --> 16:01.361
How dare that thief
call me a thief.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.063
- Why are you talking
like that?

16:03.163 --> 16:07.034
- I dunno. It helps me forget
I'm in a garbage can.

16:07.067 --> 16:10.337
Tally-ho!

16:10.437 --> 16:12.872
- Barb, I have to go
to the bathroom.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.807
- Not so fast.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.809
Remember, if you "charge"
into electrical situations,

16:16.909 --> 16:19.812
you might be "shocked"
by what happens.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.415
- Really, Barb?
More safety commercials?

16:22.515 --> 16:23.883
- Take it from Electriss--

16:24.051 --> 16:26.619
if you "charge" into
electrical situations,

16:26.719 --> 16:29.189
you may be "shocked"
by what happens,

16:29.289 --> 16:32.525
and that's what's up.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.695
- MALE ANNOUNCING: Paid for
by Superheroes for Safety.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.431
- I swear I don't have
any charge in me,

16:38.531 --> 16:42.402
but I do have plenty
of water and it wants out!

16:42.502 --> 16:44.204
Is there something
wrong with your neck?

16:44.304 --> 16:46.206
- Yeah, someone in
tires rolled over me

16:46.306 --> 16:49.842
when I was trying
to save them. Just...

16:49.942 --> 16:52.412
Kids!
No, you can't go inside yet.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.381
The kids have something
to show you.

16:54.481 --> 16:57.350
Quick, blindfold your Dad
for his birthday piñata

16:57.450 --> 16:59.386
that he will hit
because it exists.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.888
- Why are we talking
like this?

17:01.988 --> 17:04.391
- Blindfold the man.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.293
- I love piñatas.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.261
Is it filled with
candy or steak?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.197
No, don't tell me.
Let it be a surprise.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.166
Please be steak!

17:13.266 --> 17:14.934
[laughing]

17:15.102 --> 17:17.437
- Okay, the piñata's
in front of you.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.306
Swing away!

17:19.406 --> 17:25.112
- [broom whooshing]

17:25.178 --> 17:26.613
- I can't believe Max
and Phoebe aren't here yet

17:26.713 --> 17:28.581
with your father's gift.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.583
His birthday's gonna
be ruined again.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.485
- Ooh, so close, Dad.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.487
- Aw, I'm comin'
for you, candy--

17:34.587 --> 17:36.456
and/or steak!
- [broom whooshing]

17:36.556 --> 17:38.158
- He's had like 50 swings.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.193
When's it gonna
be my turn?

17:40.293 --> 17:43.463
- [broom whooshing]

17:45.565 --> 17:48.401
- [banana peel whooshes, splats]
- KID: Oh!

17:48.501 --> 17:50.270
- We've gotta get rid
of that masseuse.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.971
I know. We'll find
the security office,

17:52.139 --> 17:54.141
hack into the mall's PA system
and then announce that--

17:54.241 --> 17:56.008
- Or we can do this.

17:59.446 --> 18:02.014
- Less clever, but works.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.887
- MAN: My back is in knots

18:07.987 --> 18:09.922
thanks to this girl
who came into my store.

18:10.022 --> 18:15.162
She tried to steal a vest.
Can you believe it?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.729
- She sounds annoying.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.765
- Mmm. You should've seen
what she was wearing.

18:18.865 --> 18:22.369
Two words--last season.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.404
- [pounding on back] She could
have nicer clothes at home!

18:24.504 --> 18:26.506
You don't know!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.975
- [voice vibrating]
Easy...

18:29.075 --> 18:32.212
That's not a knot,
that's my spine.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.347
- [coins rattle]

18:34.447 --> 18:35.782
- Four quarters!

18:35.882 --> 18:37.850
Hello, Ear Blasters.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.686
- Max, no.
Watch, remember?

18:39.786 --> 18:42.722
- Wait, I'd know that
accentless voice anywhere.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.226
Hmmmm...

18:46.326 --> 18:48.428
- You stole my Dad's watch
and I want it back.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.996
- MAN: [grunting]

18:50.096 --> 18:52.765
- Max, the watch!
- Phoebe, the Ear Blasters!

18:52.865 --> 18:55.968
- Dad's birthday
is more important.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.638
- [powers whooshing]
- What is happening?

18:58.738 --> 19:02.275
Oh!
[straining]

19:11.384 --> 19:12.785
[sputtering]

19:12.885 --> 19:16.323
I am the weekend Assistant
Manager of Sarah Finn.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.825
I don't deserve this.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.560
- But you do deserve this.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.762
- [hand smacks face]
Oh!

19:26.699 --> 19:29.902
- I got 'em.
Thank you, Mr. Fairy.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.974
- All right, come on, we can
still make it to Dad's party.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.776
- Wait, where's Oyster?

19:36.876 --> 19:41.614
- Uh, he must have given
up and gone home.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.252
- [muffled screaming]

19:48.355 --> 19:50.357
- [broom whooshing]

19:50.457 --> 19:52.492
- [grunting]

19:52.592 --> 19:54.794
Man, this is a small piñata.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.263
- [broom whooshing]

19:56.329 --> 19:59.466
- Guys? Guys?

20:01.634 --> 20:03.069
There's no piñata.

20:03.169 --> 20:06.373
I've been swinging
at imaginary meat?

20:06.473 --> 20:09.876
Why does my birthday
hate me?

20:09.976 --> 20:11.444
- [thunder crashing]

20:11.544 --> 20:14.981
- Oh, that cloud
looks familiar.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.049
- This is the last message
I'm gonna leave.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.619
I can't believe how
irresponsible you two are being.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.688
I mean, I expect this
from you, Max,

20:21.788 --> 20:23.390
but not you, Phoebe.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.991
It's what I would have said...

20:25.091 --> 20:28.194
if you just hadn't
walked in. Bye.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.696
Perfect timing.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.564
Give or take three hours.

20:31.664 --> 20:35.302
Okay, everybody hide.
I'll go get Hank.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.804
- Oh, I need a bathroom!

20:37.904 --> 20:39.406
- ALL: Surprise!

20:39.506 --> 20:42.675
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.
You guys...

20:42.775 --> 20:44.277
This is perfect.
I had no idea.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.446
- We invited all the people
that you love the most.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.718
- Thank you for
coming, everyone.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.820
This is the best
birthday ever.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.422
Now I've just gotta--
- Wait, Dad.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.756
Uh, here, open this.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.659
It's from all of us.
- Okay.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.562
- You have no idea
what this cost me.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.163
Ear Blasters.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.466
It cost me a pair
of Ear Blasters.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.336
- Oh, a new watch!

21:09.402 --> 21:10.903
Thanks, guys.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.905
You have no idea
what this means

21:13.005 --> 21:15.342
and I'll tell you as soon
as I go to the bathroom!

21:15.442 --> 21:16.943
- But, honey,
someone's in there.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.210
- Oh, I can't wait.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.347
I'm going to
the gas station.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.783
- [thunder crashing]
- [electrical zapping]

21:23.883 --> 21:26.018
- [loud thud]

21:28.788 --> 21:30.690
- I'm sorry, Hank!

21:30.790 --> 21:36.796
I had no idea this watch was a
super-conductor of electricity.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.566
- [sadly]
Happy Birthday, Dad...

21:39.666 --> 21:40.867
- [ambulance siren wailing]

21:40.967 --> 21:42.435
- Take it from Electriss--

21:42.535 --> 21:45.438
cramming too many plugs
into a socket isn't cool.

21:45.538 --> 21:50.543
So fight that urge
and get a surge...protector.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.111
Take it from Electriss--

21:52.211 --> 21:54.847
before leaving home, make sure
you turn off the lights

21:54.947 --> 22:00.487
because wasting electricity
megahertz us all.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.390
- MALE ANNOUNCING: Paid for
