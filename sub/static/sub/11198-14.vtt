WEBVTT

00:10.960 --> 00:15.440
- Receiving a signal. It's the Kelownans.
- Open the iris.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:25.400 --> 00:29.800
- Mr Quinn. It's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, sir.

00:29.880 --> 00:33.840
I only wish it was
under better circumstances.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.000
We need to talk.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.840
For several months we've been analysing
data on the crystal left behind by Thanos.

00:43.920 --> 00:48.280
It was the Goa'uld
that occupied our planet 3,000 years ago.

00:48.360 --> 00:55.560
Our progress at first was slow, but we
recently made a major, major discovery.

00:57.120 --> 01:02.520
It turns out that naquadria
was not originally present.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.080
- Here.
- What do you mean?

01:05.640 --> 01:07.760
It's not native to our planet.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.760
It exists
in the mineral deposits underground.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.560
I know it does now,

01:12.640 --> 01:17.960
but we believe that those deposits were
originally made up of ordinary naqahdah.

01:18.040 --> 01:22.560
- I assume this makes sense to you.
- Actually, no, it doesn't.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.760
We found a reference
to a process the Goa'uld discovered

01:25.840 --> 01:30.000
which let them convert raw naqahdah into
naquadria while it's still in the ground.

01:30.080 --> 01:35.400
It started a chain reaction which has
continued on down through the veins,

01:35.480 --> 01:39.520
getting deeper and deeper,
and we believe the process is ongoing.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.280
Are you saying that right now there are
deposits of naqahdah on your planet

01:43.360 --> 01:45.360
being transformed into naquadria?

01:45.440 --> 01:48.720
Yes. One very large one in particular.

01:48.800 --> 01:53.160
We only recently discovered it
because it's so far beneath the surface.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.600
But as the conversion process goes
deeper, the heat and pressure get higher.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.720
And naquadria is highly unstable.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.960
We believe that when it reaches
a certain depth, it's going to explode.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.240
With enough force to obliterate Kelowna.

03:24.360 --> 03:29.880
The first few references to the conversion
process that we found were pretty vague.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.560
I was half-convinced
I'd made a mistake in the translation.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.280
Then we came across test results

03:36.360 --> 03:42.680
which show the ratio of naqahdah
to naquadria achieved in the process.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.760
Check this out.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.840
The unconverted naqahdah
breaks down into lighter elements.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.600
I was wondering why we never found any
naquadria anywhere else in the galaxy.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.560
Now I think it's because
it doesn't exist in nature at all.

03:58.640 --> 04:03.640
That's why none of the Goa'uld knew
about it until Anubis probed your mind.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.480
We've got the latest geological data.
It looks like...

04:07.560 --> 04:11.120
- Oh. Hello.
- Hi.

04:12.320 --> 04:17.320
Oh... Samantha Carter, this is
Kianna Cyr. This is... Sam Carter.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.800
- She helps me out on the translations.
- I've heard a lot about you.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.960
- We could use your expertise right now.
- What you got?

04:24.040 --> 04:27.200
The naquadria has progressed
deeper than we thought.

04:27.280 --> 04:31.160
- How much time do we have?
- A few weeks, a month. It's hard to say.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.560
We must understand how the conversion
process works if we want to stop it.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.560
Yeah, but the information
on the crystal's incomplete.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.520
Then we're gonna have
to figure it out for ourselves.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.440
Ambassador, welcome to Earth.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.760
- Actually, it's First Minister now.
- First Minister.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.120
This is Vin Eremal and Lucia Tarthus,

05:03.200 --> 05:05.880
the Tiranian and Andari representatives
on the council.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.960
Councillors.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
Right this way.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.320
I assumed Jonas Quinn
would be joining us.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.920
He sends his apologies. He's devoting
his attention to the naquadria problem.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.320
Has any progress been made?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.680
So far very little, I'm afraid.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.640
I believe that with the participation
of our friends from Earth,

05:31.720 --> 05:33.320
a solution will be found.

05:33.400 --> 05:38.560
We all hope that's the case, but you may
want to consider some contingency plans.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.600
We can offer you limited relocation
through the Stargate.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.080
Limited?

05:43.160 --> 05:47.040
A full evacuation of an industrialised
world is a practical impossibility.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.920
I'm not sure I understand.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.840
You invited us here
to propose that we abandon Langara?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.240
Langara is the new name of our planet.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.680
It's from an ancient dialect
common to all three nations.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.760
A symbol of our new unity.

06:04.760 --> 06:08.600
- Has a nice ring to it.
- It was chosen by a committee.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.120
We understand
that if this problem cannot be solved,

06:11.200 --> 06:13.200
Kelowna will suffer severe devastation.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.760
At which point we are prepared
to offer the survivors humanitarian aid.

06:16.840 --> 06:20.720
We have limited resources,
but we pledge to do what we can.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.360
- Are you kidding?
- Has no one explained this to you?

06:25.440 --> 06:28.440
We have tried.
They seem unwilling to accept the truth.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.240
If you knew our history,

06:30.320 --> 06:33.400
you'd understand our reluctance
to believe Kelownan propaganda.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.840
Our own scientists
have studied the problem.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.240
While Kelowna
will bear the brunt of the explosion -

06:38.320 --> 06:41.920
in fact, almost half the country's
landmass will be destroyed -

06:42.000 --> 06:45.440
you're not taking into account
the debris in the upper atmosphere.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.680
It will block the sunlight and lower the
average surface temperature significantly.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.760
Your entire planet will be uninhabitable.

07:01.560 --> 07:06.400
It makes no sense. Naquadria is a heavier,
less stable isotope than naqahdah.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.760
Conversion should require
the continuous input of energy.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.440
But it seems to be continuing on its own.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.520
- Which is impossible.
- Not necessarily.

07:15.600 --> 07:20.800
Low-energy fusion can occur in the
presence of certain catalysts like muons.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.840
I believe that only works for extremely
light materials such as deuterium.

07:24.920 --> 07:29.080
Kelownan understanding of particle
physics seems to have come a long way.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.160
We're quick learners.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.880
I wasn't thinking
about muons specifically.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.840
Other subatomic particles
could have catalysed this reaction.

07:37.920 --> 07:42.200
The real question is why didn't this planet
blow up a long time ago?

07:42.280 --> 07:43.480
What do you mean?

07:43.560 --> 07:45.560
You haven't figured out the process

07:45.640 --> 07:50.040
because you've assumed that this
transformation began 3,000 years ago.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.440
- That's what the historical data indicates.
- Maybe so.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.880
If you put that aside and assume
the presence of the right catalysts,

07:56.960 --> 07:59.000
you can account for this reaction.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.520
- It's just a lot faster than you thought.
- How much faster?

08:02.600 --> 08:05.120
A deposit
the size of the one you discovered

08:05.200 --> 08:09.000
could take as little as a few years
to transform completely.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.320
(rumbling)

08:27.760 --> 08:29.760
What was that?

08:33.080 --> 08:36.159
Receiving video transmission, sir.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.200
Major, what's your situation?

08:39.280 --> 08:42.559
Most of the fires caused
by the earthquake are under control.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.800
Dr Fraiser's organising
the distribution of medical supplies.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.520
- It's hard to believe it was a coincidence.
- It wasn't.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.920
We traced the epicentre
to a small pocket of converted naquadria

08:53.000 --> 08:55.120
located about 20km below the surface.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.600
A small pocket?

08:56.680 --> 09:02.320
When the main deposit goes, the
explosion will be 100,000 times greater.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.600
- This planet?
- Madronas.

09:08.680 --> 09:12.440
- And how far away is it?
- Approximately 14,000 light years.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.040
Give or take.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.520
The Madronans
are a peaceful, advanced society

09:18.600 --> 09:21.160
with resources
to accept thousands of refugees.

09:21.240 --> 09:25.920
Quinn's reports refer to uninhabited
planets capable of sustaining life.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.400
The Andari government might consider
relocation if one were available.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.360
Without infrastructure,
any uninhabited planet

09:32.440 --> 09:35.240
would not be able to sustain
as many Langaran refugees.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.040
I'm not suggesting one planet for all of us.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.680
You want your own planet?

09:40.760 --> 09:45.000
The Andari people would welcome a fresh
start, given the oppression we've suffered.

09:45.080 --> 09:48.560
All you suffered under Tiranian rule
was peace and good government!

09:48.640 --> 09:51.000
And mass arrests, summary executions!

09:51.080 --> 09:54.960
- In response to terrorist acts!
- Whoa!

09:56.160 --> 09:58.640
We're getting a bit off-topic here.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.880
Three separate relocations
is just not practical.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.880
Madronas is your best bet
to save as many lives as possible.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.640
Jonas. Major Carter.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.480
You've discovered something
about the conversion process.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.320
We determined that the transformation
must have begun

10:30.400 --> 10:33.360
with a massive bombardment
of subatomic particles

10:33.440 --> 10:36.880
which catalyse the reaction and allow it
to continue without energy input.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.600
It's possible
to create these particles in the lab.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.760
But there's only one way
they could have been produced

10:43.840 --> 10:47.200
with enough energy to penetrate
several miles into the crust of the planet.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.760
It was the naquadria bomb test.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.040
The test
that was conducted two years ago.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.440
We did this to ourselves.

11:06.600 --> 11:10.720
Historical documents indicate that Thanos
was destroyed in some cataclysmic event.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.600
Maybe this explosion
triggered the chain reaction.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.880
It did. At least with the naqahdah deposit
near the surface.

11:16.960 --> 11:23.360
Thanos managed to create naquadria
in the lab, but something went wrong.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.040
The resulting explosion
released the subatomic particles

11:27.120 --> 11:29.960
which catalysed the conversion
of the first vein of naqahdah.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.760
The rest of the deposit
transformed in less than a year.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.960
After that it lay in the ground.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.360
Another 10,000 years and it would have
decayed back into naqahdah -

11:38.440 --> 11:40.440
if you hadn't mined it first.

11:40.520 --> 11:46.240
Then we set off the bomb, which started
the conversion of the second, deeper vein.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.120
This is outrageous.

11:53.200 --> 11:57.200
If what you say is true, the Kelownan
government bears full responsibility

11:57.280 --> 11:59.280
for the imminent destruction of Langara.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.320
Your governments formed an alliance
to attack Kelowna.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.400
We were looking to defend ourselves.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.640
We went to a heightened war alert
after we learned of your research.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.520
- Which proves you were spying on us.
- What choice did we have?

12:11.600 --> 12:14.800
We weren't going to rely on the
Kelownan government to tell us the truth.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.280
Councillors, please.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.320
These talks must be suspended
until I confer with my cabinet.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.880
- For crying out loud!
- Jack.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.960
Who cares whose fault it is?

12:24.040 --> 12:27.160
Your planet is gonna blow up.
The whole damn planet, Daniel!

12:27.240 --> 12:29.880
I think it's best if we all take a little recess.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.800
(groans)

12:34.880 --> 12:37.360
General.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.440
- I say we send 'em packing.
- Indeed.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.160
We still have the potential
to save thousands of lives.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.000
And yet
they don't seem to understand or care.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.520
This is diplomacy, the way
the game is played. It takes patience.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.160
Yeah? Well, I'm fresh out.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.240
As am I.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.240
I think you're on your own.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.320
However many times you go over this,
we'll come to the same conclusion.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.680
There is simply no way
to reverse the process.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.960
Maybe we don't have to.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.440
According to the latest geological data,

13:19.520 --> 13:22.280
there's a minor fault line
crossing the vein of naqahdah

13:22.360 --> 13:24.840
about a kilometre above the large deposit.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.280
If we could somehow
trigger a move along the fault line,

13:28.360 --> 13:32.560
we could isolate the advancing naquadria
and break off the chain reaction.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.280
- How do we do that?
- Set off a large explosion near the fault.

13:36.360 --> 13:40.040
Stargate Command
could provide a small nuclear device.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.840
The only problem is
we'd have to get it down there,

13:42.920 --> 13:46.160
which means drilling
through 20 kilometres of solid rock.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.360
- What?
- There's something I wanna show you.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.640
It took us 2.5 years to build,

14:20.720 --> 14:24.080
at a cost of over half
the annual Kelownan research budget.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.840
A deep-underground excavation vehicle.

14:30.840 --> 14:31.920
Cool.

14:35.320 --> 14:41.760
The fore and aft sections have both
been outfitted with titanium cutter heads,

14:41.840 --> 14:47.600
each of which can withstand or apply
thrusts of up to 50 metric tonnes.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.040
What kind of advance rate?

14:51.120 --> 14:54.200
Uh... about 80 metres per hour.

14:55.200 --> 15:00.080
I know it's not fast enough, but I do have
an idea for a little adjustment

15:00.160 --> 15:02.760
that'll give us a lot more speed.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.840
Tok'ra tunnel crystals.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.960
Modified to work
in conjunction with the cutter heads.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.960
Pretty impressive.
Mind if I look at your power systems?

15:11.040 --> 15:13.520
After you.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.760
- Do we have to show her everything?
- Kianna.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.840
Everybody has an agenda, Jonas.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.520
Her people have made no secret
of their interest in our naquadria deposits.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.520
Look, I've wanted to come forward
with this for a long time,

15:31.600 --> 15:34.120
but I always got overruled by the cabinet.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.520
- Now we have no choice.
- We don't need her.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.440
We can go to the Tok'ra ourselves.

15:40.520 --> 15:44.120
I worked with these people
for over a year.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.920
I trust them with my life.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.360
Don't worry.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.040
The machine was designed
to mine naquadria.

16:11.120 --> 16:15.320
In the terms of our alliance, information
relating to naquadria is to be shared.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.600
We were misled.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.880
We intended to tell you
once the prototype was fully operational.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.520
Do you take us for idiots?

16:22.600 --> 16:25.560
It was you that created this disaster.

16:25.640 --> 16:29.160
And now you expect to benefit
by acquiring alien technology?

16:29.240 --> 16:34.160
It was unfortunate the Kelownans
didn't reveal this information sooner.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.920
However, regarding the Tok'ra crystals,
you really have no choice.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.520
Without them we won't reach the
naquadria vein in time to save your world.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.600
It's that simple.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.320
Wow. Jonas.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.320
This technology
is beyond anything I've seen in Kelowna.

16:56.920 --> 17:01.560
I made some adjustments based on
what I learned in Stargate Command.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.240
Pretty amazing.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.440
Yeah, I tell you,
most of the credit goes to Kianna.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.599
- Kianna?
- Oh, yeah.

17:08.680 --> 17:12.200
She took what she learned from me
and made modifications to the hydraulics,

17:12.280 --> 17:16.040
the shielding mechanisms, everything.

17:16.119 --> 17:20.920
Without her, this thing would be
months away from being operational.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.160
You two
have been working closely on this.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.440
Yeah, I guess.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.440
- What?
- Come on, Jonas, I'm not blind.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.800
What's going on?

17:33.880 --> 17:36.880
Let's just say
that it's in the development stage.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.000
Although I do find her interesting.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.000
I bet you do.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.720
Teal'c.
I trust your mission was a success?

18:37.800 --> 18:41.240
Indeed. The crystals you requested.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.120
Thank you.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.680
How are the negotiations progressing?

18:46.760 --> 18:50.600
Well, they finally agreed to send
a three-person delegation to Madronas

18:50.680 --> 18:52.760
to evaluate it as an evacuation site.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.840
What of Jonas and Major Carter?

18:54.920 --> 18:57.800
They're adjusting
the Kelownan excavation machine.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.200
It should be ready for launch
within 24 hours.

19:09.600 --> 19:14.960
Hey. Just in time to help me
run a few diagnostic programs.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.160
What?

19:20.240 --> 19:24.400
Jonas, did you design
the primary power distribution circuits?

19:24.480 --> 19:26.480
I didn't really design anything.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.800
I did make suggestions for upgrades.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.360
Based on advanced technology
you encountered with SG-1?

19:32.440 --> 19:34.680
Yeah, that's right.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.760
Why, what's wrong?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.920
The hardware's different,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.440
but the basic principle
is very similar to a Goa'uld design.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.800
- That's impossible.
- I went over it three times.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.000
I probably wouldn't have noticed

19:48.080 --> 19:55.280
if I hadn't calculated that the generators
were operating at 130% efficiency.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.840
No.

19:57.920 --> 20:02.200
- There's some mistake.
- Jonas, who did design the system?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.880
Jonas, what's going on?

20:14.960 --> 20:17.600
- We know.
- What are you talking about?

20:17.680 --> 20:21.200
- Who do you serve?
- Jonas, whatever you think...

20:21.280 --> 20:25.120
- Whatever she told you is a lie.
- They searched your quarters.

20:25.200 --> 20:29.320
Do you want to explain why they found
a Goa'uld communication device?

20:37.600 --> 20:40.000
(deep voice) Very well.
You know the truth.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.840
Now how shall we proceed?

20:50.480 --> 20:54.280
I'm assuming this is the drug
that allowed you to escape detection.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.840
It somehow masks the presence
of a symbiote, right?

20:58.680 --> 21:01.400
I'm sending this
back to the SGC for analysis.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.520
How long have you been on this planet?

21:03.600 --> 21:06.120
We knew Anubis came here for a reason.

21:06.200 --> 21:10.440
After his defeat I was despatched to find
out why he was so interested in this place.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.400
So you work for Baal?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.680
I gained access to Kelowna's research

21:15.760 --> 21:19.360
by implanting myself
in a scientist on the naquadria project.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.320
Let me talk to Kianna.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.240
In a small way
I've grown to admire this host.

21:25.320 --> 21:30.080
She is exceptionally astute.
A superior specimen.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.360
Let me talk to her.

21:31.440 --> 21:35.080
I made the major modifications
to the excavator.

21:35.160 --> 21:39.160
If you wish to complete this undertaking,
you will require my assistance.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.320
Why would you help us?

21:42.360 --> 21:46.240
We share a common goal.
I too wish to save this world.

21:46.320 --> 21:51.120
So you can hand it over to Baal?
I don't think so.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.440
(as Kianna) Jonas.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.960
Kianna?

21:58.040 --> 22:00.760
She's right. You're going to need her.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.280
Let her help you,
for the sake of our people.

22:06.360 --> 22:11.040
It's not her, Jonas. It's a Goa'uld
trying to fool us. We've seen it before.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.040
No. Jonas, please.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.880
Get her outta here.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.480
Depth is 2200 metres.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.000
Speed 1.5 metres per second.

22:32.280 --> 22:35.000
- The drills are running hot.
- All right.

22:35.080 --> 22:38.880
Bring down your RPMs.
Don't overcompensate.

22:39.920 --> 22:46.040
- I can't stay ahead of these adjustments.
- You're gonna stall us out. Power up.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.320
(drill stops)

22:48.400 --> 22:51.160
You stripped the drill heads.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.920
Control. End simulation.

22:55.680 --> 22:59.160
Jonas, we've got a problem.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.000
(Tarthus) Could this
be the result of Goa'uld sabotage?

23:03.080 --> 23:06.640
No. Major Carter believes
the Goa'uld's modifications

23:06.720 --> 23:10.120
have improved the speed
and efficiency of the drills.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.720
The system requires
constant adjustments

23:12.800 --> 23:15.480
according to the material
it's passing through.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.560
It's kind of like shifting gears in a racecar.

23:19.640 --> 23:23.360
Major Carter isn't confident
in her ability to run the drill.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.800
She thinks the best person for the job
is the Goa'uld.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.880
You can't be serious.

23:28.960 --> 23:32.040
We could overhaul the system
and eliminate the modifications,

23:32.120 --> 23:36.320
but that would reduce the speed
of the excavator and it would take weeks.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
We don't have that kind of time.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.000
The Goa'uld could have
sabotaged it any time.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.000
Instead she helped Jonas
improve several key systems.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.160
Only to preserve
the naquadria deposit for Baal.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.800
Maybe so, but averting the explosion
is our first priority.

23:50.880 --> 23:53.760
Without the Goa'uld, we have no chance.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.600
You've made the right choice.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.960
Your confidence in me
will not go unrewarded.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.520
We had no choice. And for the record,
our confidence in you is minimal.

24:20.400 --> 24:25.280
Which is, no doubt,
why the shol'va will be accompanying us.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.680
And why all of you are armed.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.680
- Who calibrated the primary inductors?
- I did.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.200
Launch now and you will burn
through them before you pass 100 metres.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.080
Right. I'll take navigation.

24:43.160 --> 24:46.000
Teal'c, take shields and life support.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.680
Indeed.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.520
(man) We are go for launch
in 30 seconds.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.600
Powering up.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.640
Engines are at 70%.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.760
80.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.560
- Shields are active.
- (Carter) Navigation computer is online.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.160
Engines are at full power.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.720
Control, we're set to go for launch...

25:21.440 --> 25:28.320
in five... four... three... two... one.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.400
We've just received word from Kelowna.

25:44.480 --> 25:48.920
Our security personnel monitored
a communication device of Kianna's.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.720
Apparently a message
has come through from Baal.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.800
She's overdue to report. He's waiting
for her to send a transmission.

25:55.880 --> 25:59.560
- And if she doesn't?
- They'll come to find out what happened.

25:59.640 --> 26:02.480
That's a distinct possibility.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.200
(beeping)

26:09.520 --> 26:10.720
What is it?

26:10.800 --> 26:13.520
We are losing coolant pressure
in one of the forward tubes.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.720
We must have broken a seal.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.800
Major Carter, take the controls.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.880
Where are you going?

26:21.960 --> 26:25.600
I can divert coolant from the aft,
but I have to do it from the engine room.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.480
I'm coming with you.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.120
You still do not trust me, do you?

26:33.200 --> 26:35.200
No.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.600
Is there any way to contact the excavator?

26:40.680 --> 26:44.480
They're too deep. No radio signal
could penetrate that much solid rock.

26:44.560 --> 26:48.480
Telling them about Baal's message
will not change anything.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.560
If the Goa'uld doesn't make it back?

26:50.640 --> 26:52.960
That would only happen
if the mission fails.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.760
If that's the case,
Baal will be the least of your problems.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.760
I suggest we get back
to planning your relocation.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.760
- Check it now.
- Forward pressure's rising.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.640
We're good.

27:16.480 --> 27:19.440
Maybe now you'll believe
that I wish this mission to succeed?

27:19.520 --> 27:21.600
Yeah - for the wrong reasons.

27:21.680 --> 27:26.640
Has it ever occurred to you that serving
Baal may not be my only interest here?

27:26.720 --> 27:31.800
I never thought I'd find
the company of a human so intriguing.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.600
And suddenly I repulse you?

27:35.680 --> 27:38.080
Not that long ago you felt differently.

27:38.160 --> 27:42.200
That was before I found out who you are.
What you are.

27:42.280 --> 27:48.240
And yet the fact remains...
you never knew the host before I took her.

27:48.320 --> 27:52.360
All this time it was never Kianna,
it was always me.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.720
(beeping)

28:04.320 --> 28:06.360
- What is happening?
- I'm not sure.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.440
We're still on course, still descending.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.520
Hull temperature is rising rapidly.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.680
300 degrees.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.720
400 degrees and still rising.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.200
Is there any volcanic activity in the area?

28:27.280 --> 28:30.080
Mount Kallan. But it's been dormant
for hundreds of years.

28:30.160 --> 28:34.000
Just because it's dormant doesn't mean
there couldn't be magma flows.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.880
Hull temperature is 700 degrees
and still rising.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.560
We're passing through a river
of molten rock.

28:47.520 --> 28:51.080
Daniel, how's the whole diplomacy thing
working out for you?

28:51.160 --> 28:53.360
The latest argument's about selection -

28:53.440 --> 28:58.200
a lottery, assigning positions or setting up
a committee to discuss the problem.

28:58.280 --> 29:04.520
I remind them they're facing annihilation,
but they can't face their own mistrust.

29:04.600 --> 29:09.560
- I think I can help you out on this.
- What do you mean?

29:10.320 --> 29:12.360
Hull temperature is 1100 degrees.

29:12.440 --> 29:16.720
- The ship will not take much more of this.
- Divert power to the shields.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.480
We have no way of knowing
how thick this vein of magma is.

29:19.560 --> 29:23.640
- If we turn back now, we may survive.
- I said divert power to the shields.

29:29.880 --> 29:35.040
Power diverted. Although I'm not sure
how much difference it will make.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.080
Hull temperature is 1200 degrees.

29:40.520 --> 29:44.200
Do you really want to risk your life
for the people of this world, Major?

29:44.280 --> 29:48.160
I am not so sure
they would do the same for you.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.080
We're losing hull integrity!

30:03.200 --> 30:05.200
Teal'c?

30:05.800 --> 30:09.720
Hull temperature is dropping.
1100 degrees and still falling.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.560
We made it through.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.600
Very impressive.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.840
Kelowna will accept nothing less
than equal representation.

30:27.920 --> 30:31.640
Really? Kelowna is solely responsible
for this problem.

30:31.720 --> 30:35.000
(Dreylock) Need I remind you
that the Stargate is in our possession?

30:35.080 --> 30:37.280
- (Tarthus) For the moment.
- Is that a threat?

30:37.360 --> 30:41.880
When it comes to the survival of our
people, we will do whatever is necessary.

30:41.960 --> 30:46.280
Now you want a war? We're trying to save
your world and you wanna destroy it?

30:46.360 --> 30:48.840
Save your breath, Daniel.

30:50.840 --> 30:54.200
- You folks are done.
- I don't understand.

30:54.960 --> 30:58.640
Well, you see,
we actually like the Madronans.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.720
They're nice people.

31:00.800 --> 31:05.360
We've decided there's no way
we'd subject them to the likes of you.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.960
Deal's off. You're toast.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.720
- General?
- Colonel O'Neill's right.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.800
You can stay until we hear back
from Jonas and Major Carter.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.720
It's what you get for dickin' around.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.680
Something's wrong.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.600
We're losing speed.
1.5 metres per second and slowing.

31:31.680 --> 31:35.600
It is the forward drills.
They were damaged by the magma.

31:35.680 --> 31:38.080
They are coming apart.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.280
- We stopped.
- Forward drill's finished.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.800
Cutting power.

31:52.200 --> 31:56.440
- It's as deep as we're gonna get.
- What is our position?

31:57.920 --> 32:01.720
We're still over a kilometre
from the target.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.240
What if we drop the bomb here?

32:06.320 --> 32:11.040
We're too far from the fault line.
It would be pointless.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.360
Then we have failed.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.760
- We have to go back and repair the ship.
- Too much damage. It'll take weeks.

32:30.840 --> 32:34.520
I'm sorry, Jonas,
but we don't have a choice.

32:36.160 --> 32:39.240
We still have crystals. We can use those
to tunnel the rest of the way.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.640
- They'd never make it far enough.
- If we focus them,

32:43.720 --> 32:46.040
we can dig a passage
big enough for one person.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.120
- That will give us the distance we need.
- It might work.

32:49.200 --> 32:54.200
But at this depth, the heat and the gases
would penetrate even a Tok'ra tunnel.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.400
- It would be suicide.
- I will go.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.920
Do not worry, Major Carter.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.640
I may be intrigued by your willingness
to sacrifice yourself, but I do not share it.

33:09.720 --> 33:13.160
- My symbiote will protect me.
- Why take the risk?

33:13.920 --> 33:16.600
You still think of me
as nothing but a servant of Baal.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.960
You are mistaken.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.920
You haven't told him about the naquadria?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Not yet.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.440
You want it for yourself.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.840
The fact remains that I am the only one
who can complete this mission.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.120
The tunnel is complete.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.240
You understand
the detonation procedure?

33:50.320 --> 33:53.600
Of course. It is a simple enough device.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.960
I am in position.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.360
I am setting...

34:53.840 --> 34:55.840
the detonator.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.360
(beeping)

35:08.520 --> 35:10.800
This is not good.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.000
Kianna, this is Major Carter. Do you read?

35:21.440 --> 35:22.440
Go ahead.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.400
We're losing power. I think
the generators have been damaged.

35:25.960 --> 35:30.200
I was afraid of that.
How much power do you have left?

35:30.880 --> 35:33.520
We're down to 70%.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.960
- So much for my empire!
- Say again.

35:42.840 --> 35:46.760
If you begin the ascent now,

35:48.160 --> 35:51.880
you may have enough power
to reach the surface.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.080
- We're not leaving you behind.
- You have no choice.

35:56.160 --> 36:00.280
If the power drops below 50%,

36:00.360 --> 36:05.760
you will not even be able
to restart the engines.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.400
I am already dead.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.640
If you wait, you die too.

36:15.200 --> 36:18.440
This is Jonas. There's still time left.
Start back immediately.

36:19.080 --> 36:23.560
If you are doing this
out of concern for the host,

36:23.640 --> 36:26.120
you need not bother.

36:27.520 --> 36:32.920
The body is already severely damaged.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.760
Even if we make it back,

36:36.840 --> 36:39.760
I may not be able to keep her alive.

36:39.840 --> 36:44.600
Listen to me. We're not going without you,
so shut up and get moving.

37:11.400 --> 37:15.800
- We should have heard by now.
- Something went wrong.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.000
Power's down to 53%.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.520
She's taking twice as long to get back
as she took to get down.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.640
Kianna? This is Jonas.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.880
Come in. Over.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.200
Please respond.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.520
I believe we have no choice
but to begin our ascent.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.520
(banging)

37:56.120 --> 37:58.480
(groans)

38:04.840 --> 38:08.120
I'll take care of her. Get us outta here.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.920
Powering up engines.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.000
Beginning ascent.

38:21.880 --> 38:25.400
- You waited.
- You held up your end of the bargain.

38:25.480 --> 38:28.200
Was that your only reason?

38:32.320 --> 38:35.000
I already know your answer.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.840
(groans)

38:45.120 --> 38:47.880
Unscheduled offworld activation.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.960
- Receiving a signal. Audio only.
- Put it through.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.600
- Gate control to First Minister Dreylock.
- This is Dreylock. Go ahead.

39:05.680 --> 39:09.160
We're receiving reports.
A major seismic disturbance.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.040
Survey places the epicentre
at the target coordinates.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.440
- They did it.
- Any word from the excavator?

39:14.520 --> 39:17.000
Negative.

39:19.720 --> 39:25.800
- The power reserves are near depletion.
- We're almost there. Ten seconds.

39:27.600 --> 39:33.800
Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.440
You miss it?

39:59.280 --> 40:02.040
Yeah. I do.

40:04.800 --> 40:08.280
Judging from what you've got to deal with
in Kelowna, I'm not surprised.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.920
I'd take danger over
one of those council meetings any day.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.800
Yeah.

40:13.880 --> 40:18.480
I don't know what Jack said to 'em, but
they are being a little more cooperative.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.960
Let's hope it lasts.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.920
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, I guess.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.600
I remember everything,
but it's like a dream.

40:30.680 --> 40:34.040
- The symbiote's dead.
- She saved me.

40:34.120 --> 40:36.800
She could have let me die with her,
but she didn't.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.960
You may find this hard to believe, but she
appreciated everything you did for her.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.480
That you tried to do.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.800
Time to go home.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.320
