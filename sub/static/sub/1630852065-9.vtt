We'll both have dead bodies

Ugh. Great. Just great.

I'm stuck with Captain Backstabber

Whoa. [grunts]

02:06.173 --> 02:08.340
-Magnetic. [grunts]
-[barks]

02:10.673 --> 02:15.006
Huh. The magnetic surface of this planet
pulled the pod towards us.

Captain Happy to M-Bark. Come in.

02:17.090 --> 02:18.548
[magnetic static]

02:18.631 --> 02:20.798
And the atmosphere's
interfering with our comms.

Oh, yeah. Duh. Of course it is.

02:23.006 --> 02:25.006

Oh. Hey there, little buddy.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.756
[laughs]

02:54.840 --> 02:57.215
I think you've done enough, traitor.

02:57.798 --> 03:01.965
Well, I don't think I've done enough
because I'm not a traitor!

03:02.048 --> 03:03.756
Oh. Sure.

03:03.840 --> 03:08.840
What about leaving humanity behind
so you could be king of "Dog World?"

[Chonies] I know Captain Garbage
wouldn't skip the Mech Wars finals.

He's a dog of his word.
Something's definitely wrong!

03:27.798 --> 03:30.923
Kira! Hi. Have you seen Garbage?

03:31.006 --> 03:33.048
He's about this tall,
smells like corn chips.

03:33.131 --> 03:34.423
Kind of looks like corn chips.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.798
-Loaf!
-Sorry! I'm worried and hungry.

03:37.006 --> 03:40.090
You guys have been hanging out a lot.
Has he been acting strange?

03:40.173 --> 03:42.756
Ha. Hm-- Not any stranger than usu--

03:42.840 --> 03:44.840
[gasps] One of the pods is missing!

03:44.923 --> 03:46.715
What? How?

03:46.798 --> 03:49.090
Kira, did you see the pod take off?
There was no alert.

03:49.173 --> 03:50.590
Hey, what's under that tarp?

03:50.673 --> 03:51.673
[gasps]

03:52.465 --> 03:54.840
You look real tense, Kira. [chuckles]

03:54.923 --> 03:57.298
And not in the normal way
you always look tense.

03:57.381 --> 04:00.923
Oh, Kira. Did Garbage's blaster
fall off his holster into yours?

04:01.006 --> 04:02.423
What? Ha!

04:02.506 --> 04:03.965
How'd that get there?

04:04.173 --> 04:06.256
Wait! Don't touch the... surprise!

04:06.340 --> 04:08.590
For your... birthday?

04:08.673 --> 04:12.173
Kira, no one knows my birthday.
Not even me.

04:12.256 --> 04:15.965
-Oh, oh... I... I just...
-[gasps]

04:16.048 --> 04:18.715
That's restricted genetic tech
from the lab!

04:19.006 --> 04:21.006
And it's been modified.

04:21.090 --> 04:24.256
Kira. You know where he is, don't you?

You can stop screaming
that we're all gonna die now.

05:01.256 --> 05:03.881
[grunting]

05:05.173 --> 05:07.173
Right. Where was I?

05:07.256 --> 05:09.548
Oh yeah, saving us from you.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.965
[scoffs] We wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for you.

05:19.048 --> 05:21.881
That's not true, Happy.
I mean, I see why you'd--

05:21.965 --> 05:24.631
The council's not here.
You don't have to deny it.

05:24.715 --> 05:27.548
-It's just you and me, Captain.
-Stop it!

05:27.631 --> 05:30.756
And I know the real Garbage. Ho, ho.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.048
The one who sneaks around,
betrays his fellow dogs.

05:34.131 --> 05:36.881
You and Kira were ready
to turn all of our brains to mush!

05:36.965 --> 05:39.840
No! No! You've got it all wrong!

05:39.923 --> 05:43.173
Kira made me think
we were gonna save all dog-kind.

05:43.256 --> 05:45.881
And I believed her
because she understood me,

05:45.965 --> 05:47.548
and she's my friend.

05:47.631 --> 05:49.756
Or, she was my-- [groans]

05:51.215 --> 05:54.215
-What are you doing?
-I'm building a distress beacon.

05:54.298 --> 05:58.131
Oh ho, that's... useful, actually.
Let me help!

05:58.840 --> 06:01.673
Okay. I'm asking you nicely.
You want to help?

06:02.798 --> 06:04.298
Then please.

06:04.381 --> 06:06.965
[shouting] Leave... me... alone!!

-[static]

06:31.881 --> 06:34.131
And what do you think her plan is?

06:34.215 --> 06:37.256
Chonies recognized the machine.
It's genetic enhancement tech.

06:37.340 --> 06:40.923
Yes. It's a modified neuronic diffuser
with a frequency shif--

06:41.006 --> 06:42.590
Not now, Chonies!

06:43.173 --> 06:46.340
It's what Captain Garbage
would say if he were here.

06:46.631 --> 06:48.840
I request a ship-wide dog hunt for Kira.

06:49.173 --> 06:51.048
Total lockdown. No ships in or out.

06:51.131 --> 06:52.465
We can't risk her escape.

06:52.548 --> 06:55.131
-But what about Captain Garbage?
-Yeah!

06:55.215 --> 06:56.923
We'll find him. And Happy.

06:57.006 --> 06:59.631
We can't put the other dogs
or the mission at risk.

06:59.715 --> 07:02.215
-[toy squeaking]
-Track Kira first. Then we'll find them.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.548
Stella, come with me.

07:06.631 --> 07:09.465
The sooner we locate Kira,
the sooner we find our captains.

07:09.548 --> 07:13.090
Stella! The pod might have landed
on a nearby planet.

07:13.173 --> 07:15.590
I know we don't have
permission to leave, but--

07:15.673 --> 07:18.590
It's what Garbage would do for us.
I'll cover for you. Just go.

07:24.465 --> 07:26.048
Oh, I miss this!

07:26.131 --> 07:28.465
My nostrils are flaring,
my heart is pounding,

07:28.548 --> 07:30.548
I feel alive.

07:30.631 --> 07:32.298

07:38.381 --> 07:39.756
-[Stella] Mm?
-Let me help!

07:39.840 --> 07:42.090
I know every hiding place on the ship.

07:42.173 --> 07:43.423
We've got this, Ed.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.506
-[gasps]
-How 'bout now?

07:48.256 --> 07:51.965
Kira convinced me that, what she wanted
was what I wanted.

07:52.048 --> 07:54.215
And it was! Kind of.

07:54.298 --> 07:56.715
In some ways... but then it wasn't!

07:56.923 --> 07:58.506
[growls, barks]

07:58.590 --> 07:59.923
Yup, exactly.

08:00.006 --> 08:04.006
The crew must think I'm either,
a crazy traitor or a huge chump.

08:04.756 --> 08:08.673
I thought I was saving my crew,
and Kira believes she's saving us, too!

08:09.298 --> 08:10.756
It's embarrassing.

08:11.506 --> 08:13.173

Be honest, Jerry.

08:20.215 --> 08:22.506
Will my crew be able
to look me in the eye again?

08:22.590 --> 08:24.881

08:24.965 --> 08:28.506

Did you see that, Jerr-Bear?

08:54.256 --> 08:57.673
Happy's beacon thingy
just made a transmission!

08:57.840 --> 09:00.798
Out of the fireflies?
We've got to tell him!

09:00.881 --> 09:04.631
-Run like the wind, fluffy steed!
-[barking]

09:06.840 --> 09:08.215
Happy! Hey, Happy!

09:08.298 --> 09:12.548
Listen, we were up on the cliff,
your beacon shot out a weird flare and...

09:12.631 --> 09:14.131
I know. It didn't work.

09:14.215 --> 09:16.590
The lightning rod harnesses static
to power the beacon,

09:16.673 --> 09:18.798
but the fireflies disrupt the signal.

09:18.881 --> 09:21.840
Ow! And zap me. Oh, I hate them.

09:21.923 --> 09:23.965
Okay, but your beacon made the fireflies--

09:24.048 --> 09:26.631
Ah, hm. Here's the thing. Go away!

09:26.715 --> 09:28.215
[grunts] Oh!

09:29.923 --> 09:34.590
-[tuning]
-Hey. Hey, hey. What's the dial for?

09:34.798 --> 09:37.298
Scanning. For a frequency
that'll reach the M-Bark.

09:37.381 --> 09:38.673
The dial!

09:38.756 --> 09:42.173
Happy, when you turn the dial,
it alters the static's frequency.

09:42.256 --> 09:45.756
The beacon's an antennae!
The firefly butts are a TV!

09:45.840 --> 09:49.340
Did you drink puddle water?
Stop touching the beacon. Stop, stop.

09:49.423 --> 09:53.215
-Get-- Ow! Come on! Let me tune it.
-[Happy] Stop, stop, stop.

09:53.298 --> 09:54.673
-Come on.
-Stop.

09:55.590 --> 09:56.715
[both grunt]

09:57.881 --> 10:00.631
Whoa. That's... coming from out there?

10:00.715 --> 10:02.506
Is the M-Bark trying to reach us?

10:02.590 --> 10:04.340
I do not know.

10:04.423 --> 10:06.548
Let me tune it.
Maybe we'll get a clear image.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.881
-Get out! [grunts]
-Jerry! Hug!

10:18.756 --> 10:20.840
[gasps] Did you see that? Go back!

10:23.506 --> 10:27.090
Mrs. Pancakes, we're so proud of you.
You get home safe!

10:28.256 --> 10:29.798

10:29.881 --> 10:32.256
Messages! From Earth!

10:32.340 --> 10:34.923
Happy! Earth! Humans!

10:35.423 --> 10:38.215
Do you think...
Are they talking to us? Can they see us?

10:38.298 --> 10:39.548
Oh!

10:39.631 --> 10:41.548
Hey Chico buddy.

10:41.631 --> 10:44.131
So excited for you
on your space adventure.

10:44.215 --> 10:46.840
Three months is a little too long
to not be able to snuggle you,

10:46.923 --> 10:49.715
but you'll be home soon. I'm sure.

10:50.131 --> 10:52.048
He's one of the dog's humans!

10:52.131 --> 10:54.298
And wait. Months? Not years?

10:54.381 --> 10:56.423
This message is old.

10:57.715 --> 10:59.215
How many of these are there?

10:59.298 --> 11:01.173
Hello, my treasure.

11:01.256 --> 11:03.256
Whoa! It's Olga!

11:03.340 --> 11:05.673
P.R.A.T.S. Olga.
Science lady from Earth!

11:05.756 --> 11:07.465
I didn't know she had a dog.

11:07.548 --> 11:10.673
I always had her down
as more of a guinea pig kind of lady.

11:10.756 --> 11:14.381
I hope that this message finds you,
wherever you are.

11:14.465 --> 11:19.465
I've tried every frequency,
every direction, every satellite relay.

11:19.548 --> 11:23.673
And I'll try them all again
for as long as it takes for you to know,

11:23.756 --> 11:27.173
I'm looking for you. And I will find you.

11:27.256 --> 11:29.798
Be a good girl... Kira.

11:29.881 --> 11:31.465
[both] Kira!

11:33.423 --> 11:35.673
[clanking]

11:36.548 --> 11:40.173
Come on, Chonez. Hack the mainframe or...
whatever it is you do.

11:40.256 --> 11:42.256
I'm trying! Stop pressuring me!

-Atlas.

11:44.923 --> 11:46.923
Ugh! What do you want?

11:47.590 --> 11:50.465
I want to report you to council
for sneaking off ship during a lockdown,

11:50.548 --> 11:51.756
but there's no time.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.506
We're both missing
our respective captains. Move over.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.340
[beeping]

11:58.006 --> 12:00.423
Do you two have a plan?
They could be anywhere.

12:00.506 --> 12:04.673
Not true. The escape pod could only be
within 98 million miles of the M-Bark.

12:04.756 --> 12:06.298
So, that narrows it down!

12:06.381 --> 12:09.298
Precisely my point. Space is big.

12:09.381 --> 12:12.840
But if you thought to download tracking
data from the escape pod terminal...

12:12.923 --> 12:13.923
Ugh.

12:16.673 --> 12:19.840
Hm... She's 40 paces that way.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.173
You could track that from one hair?

12:22.256 --> 12:25.798
Nyet, dear Duchess.
I just know she eats beets.

12:25.881 --> 12:28.840
And you can smell that
from 40 paces away. Ugh...

12:31.090 --> 12:35.881
Well, I've narrowed it down to...
this gigantic arena?

12:35.965 --> 12:37.381
That's helpful, right?

12:37.465 --> 12:39.298
Oh! Look! Bingo!

12:41.548 --> 12:42.965
[all gasp]

12:43.048 --> 12:45.381
[mechanical whirring]

12:47.298 --> 12:48.798
Give up or die!

12:48.881 --> 12:49.881
-[gasps]
-[snarls]

12:49.965 --> 12:52.631
I have a third option. [grunt]

12:54.173 --> 12:56.131
-[coughs]
-[grunts]

12:56.215 --> 12:57.340
Get away from that!

12:59.215 --> 13:01.881
-[yells]
-[snarls]

13:02.965 --> 13:04.423
[grunts]

13:04.506 --> 13:06.298
[yells, grunts]

13:09.840 --> 13:11.423
-[growls]
-[snarls]

13:12.840 --> 13:15.006
[grunts]

13:16.840 --> 13:18.965
[Duchess grunts]

13:22.798 --> 13:23.798
[gasps]

13:24.923 --> 13:25.923
[grunts]

13:29.298 --> 13:30.840
[grunts]

13:31.423 --> 13:33.423
[yells]

13:33.506 --> 13:35.256
Play time's over.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.173
[toy squeaking]

13:39.131 --> 13:41.381
[yells, grunts]

13:44.923 --> 13:48.965
[growls, snarls, yells]

13:51.340 --> 13:53.340
[yells, grunts]

13:53.423 --> 13:56.423
-[swords clashing]
-[both grunting]

13:56.506 --> 13:58.131
Why won't you understand?

13:59.465 --> 14:02.006
-I'm trying to save all of you!
-[grunts]

14:02.090 --> 14:04.548
-[gasps]
-Here. You've got better aim than me!

14:05.840 --> 14:07.131
[shouting] Ya!

14:07.965 --> 14:09.340
[gasps]

14:10.881 --> 14:12.506
-[Stella yells]
-[Ed grunts]

14:12.590 --> 14:13.881
[all scream]

14:15.173 --> 14:16.423
[all grunt]

14:16.506 --> 14:17.798
[all coughing]

14:18.923 --> 14:20.923
[growls, snarls]

14:21.465 --> 14:24.006
Happy, Kira was wrong about humans.

14:24.090 --> 14:27.131
Her human loves her. She loves her!

14:27.215 --> 14:28.673
We have to show her this.

14:29.006 --> 14:31.340
[scoffs] None of this matters
if we can't get back.

14:31.423 --> 14:33.423
These are the only
working components we have.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.923
I have to rebuild it into something
that will let us radio the M-Bark.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.881
[yelps] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can't destroy it!

14:39.965 --> 14:41.548
Ugh! You're wrong.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.215
This is how I make sure we don't die here.

14:44.715 --> 14:46.715
By building a transmitter.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.465
Not a... lost message getter!

14:51.173 --> 14:52.465
No! [yells]

14:52.548 --> 14:54.256
-[screams]
-[Happy grunts]

14:54.340 --> 14:56.215
[fighting noises]

14:58.756 --> 15:00.298
-[Happy] Stop it!
-Not the face!

15:01.548 --> 15:02.756
Ow!

15:07.881 --> 15:09.131
[gasps]

15:10.048 --> 15:11.048
Captain!

15:11.131 --> 15:13.506
Nomi! Chonies!

15:13.590 --> 15:16.256
It's good to love you, Captain!
I mean, I love to miss you, Captain.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.798
I mean, hello Captain!

15:17.881 --> 15:20.840
Oh, Chonez!
I'm sorry I missed the Mech finals.

15:20.923 --> 15:24.006
I wish you'd seen it.
You'd have been so proud of me!

15:24.090 --> 15:25.923
-Did you win?
-No.

15:26.006 --> 15:27.756
-Oh.
-[Chonies grunts]

15:28.506 --> 15:30.048
Well done, Atlas!

15:30.131 --> 15:33.548
Well done to you for enduring Garbage's
company as long as you did, Captain.

15:33.631 --> 15:35.548
I know how challenging
that must have been.

15:35.631 --> 15:38.048
Head's up, team!
Before we get on the Pluto,

15:38.131 --> 15:41.298
we need to catch as many of those
weird fireflies as we--

15:41.381 --> 15:43.006
-[Nomi grunts]
-[barks, pants]

15:43.090 --> 15:45.590
Yeah, basically do
what they're already doing.

15:50.006 --> 15:53.006
Okay. Let's go save the M-Bark!

15:53.090 --> 15:55.423
-You got it, Captain!
-[barks]

15:59.340 --> 16:01.715
[beeping]

16:01.798 --> 16:05.090
-[grunts]
-Oh no. No, no, no!

16:09.298 --> 16:10.673
[groans]

16:10.756 --> 16:12.506
[both] Magnets.

16:16.798 --> 16:18.006
[grunts]

16:21.548 --> 16:24.631
Kira! Please? We're friends.

16:24.715 --> 16:27.798
Yes, we are. And as your friend,

16:28.006 --> 16:30.131
I urge you to believe me.

16:30.215 --> 16:32.631
[beeping]

16:32.715 --> 16:34.715
I'm doing this for you.

16:34.798 --> 16:36.798
For all of you.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.715
[whimpers]

16:43.340 --> 16:45.340
