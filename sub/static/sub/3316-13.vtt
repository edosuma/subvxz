- and drew it on a cocktail napkin.

Is there anyone you lusted after
that you missed?

06:03.481 --> 06:05.745
That's easy. Mao and Rielle Hunter.

06:05.817 --> 06:09.583
And she's still lusting
after Julian Assange.

Look, I know I said no
on-camera appearances for you...

06:13.691 --> 06:16.125

06:46.124 --> 06:47.455
A little higher, babe.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.688
Mm-mmm. Higher still.

06:51.929 --> 06:55.023
Oh, what are they teaching
these kids in film school?

06:55.099 --> 06:58.967
God knows it's not how to make
us old gals look more gorgeous.

06:59.036 --> 07:00.333
Nothing old about you, Lana.

07:00.405 --> 07:02.669
Well, thanks to a very talented
surgeon in Paris...

07:02.740 --> 07:04.105
and a great dermatologist.

07:04.175 --> 07:07.008
So, what are we covering today?

07:07.078 --> 07:08.705
Well, since it's a Kennedy Center honor...

07:08.780 --> 07:10.680
I'd say it's a pretty big canvas.

07:10.748 --> 07:13.376
Jesus, darling, I hope this isn't
going to feel like a eulogy.

07:14.152 --> 07:15.847
I will certainly ask you...

07:15.920 --> 07:18.889
about your notorious nailed-to-the-cross
prison interview with Madoff.

07:19.957 --> 07:21.686
But before all that...

07:21.759 --> 07:23.852
I'd like to go back and start
with the early years.

07:23.928 --> 07:27.125
The awful Bloody Face saga.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.360
I said I wouldn't talk about that.

07:30.435 --> 07:32.300
People want to hear about it.

07:32.370 --> 07:33.860
It's what made you famous.

07:33.938 --> 07:35.371
My point exactly.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.067
He's become a goddamn household name...

07:37.141 --> 07:40.542
like some kind of Heath Ledger,
Hollywood movie star villain.

07:40.611 --> 07:45.105
He was an evil monster
who used murder and torture...

07:45.183 --> 07:47.208
to keep himself
from feeling like a eunuch.

07:47.285 --> 07:49.116
End of story.

07:49.187 --> 07:52.020
I refuse to give him
one more second of airtime.

07:53.157 --> 07:54.681
So then let's start with the event...

07:54.759 --> 07:58.092
that made your reputation as a crusader
for change, the Briarcliff exposÃ©.

07:58.162 --> 08:00.756
- We good to go, everyone?
- Honey, hand me that mirror, will you?

08:00.832 --> 08:02.663
I like to do my own eyebrows.

08:12.677 --> 08:14.872
How do I look?

08:14.946 --> 08:16.937
- Like a million bucks.
- [Chuckles]

08:17.014 --> 08:19.505
But they're still not gonna
let us in that front door with a camera.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.347
Oh, I know how to get in.

08:21.419 --> 08:24.149
[Man]
Jesus, how did you find this place?

08:24.222 --> 08:26.486
[Lana] Listen, when we get inside,
no matter what happens...

08:26.557 --> 08:28.218
or what anybody says, you keep shooting.

08:28.292 --> 08:29.782
We need to document the conditions...

08:29.861 --> 08:32.056
the filth these people
are forced to live in.

08:32.129 --> 08:34.688
I want the footage to shock the public
out of their complacency.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.666
You understand?
I want moral outrage.

08:37.735 --> 08:40.033
I want to put America in the asylum.

08:41.371 --> 08:43.101
[April]
The fact that you would voluntarily...

08:43.174 --> 08:46.268
go back into the place
where you almost died...

08:46.344 --> 08:47.971
that's why you're held
in such high esteem...

08:48.045 --> 08:50.104
by all of America and your peers.

08:50.181 --> 08:53.241
Did you always have this need for justice?

08:54.552 --> 08:56.110
That's the myth.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.621
Lana Winters, crusader.

08:58.689 --> 09:01.749
It was a story
that I helped to perpetuate...

09:01.826 --> 09:04.590
but, uh, it's time I come clean.

09:04.662 --> 09:07.597
It wasn't justice
that got me back to Briarcliff.

09:07.665 --> 09:09.633
It was ambition.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.930
I knew my future wasn't in print.

09:12.003 --> 09:14.062
You had an abrupt career change.

09:14.138 --> 09:16.732
I knew television was the future.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.742
So I got started in local news...

09:19.810 --> 09:21.607
and then an NBC affiliate...

09:21.679 --> 09:24.477
before I landed my own series
of investigative reports.

09:24.549 --> 09:25.716
<i>America Unmasked.</i>

09:25.783 --> 09:30.520
With TV, words, they're less important.

09:30.588 --> 09:32.613
You need something people can see...

09:32.690 --> 09:34.180
visual stimulation...

09:34.258 --> 09:37.455
and believe me, there is nothing
more stimulating than crazy people.

09:37.528 --> 09:39.621
But you need more than that.

09:39.697 --> 09:43.724
You need an angle, a hook.

09:43.801 --> 09:46.634
And boy, did I have a doozy.

09:52.843 --> 09:56.404
<i>[Lana] I heard from very reliable
sources that Sister Jude...</i>

<i>the nun that imprisoned me
at Briarcliff, was still alive.</i>

<i>In fact, she had become
a patient there herself.</i>

10:03.287 --> 10:05.687
<i>I was going to go into that snake pit...</i>

10:05.756 --> 10:09.123

she had me committed.</i>

10:10.728 --> 10:13.162
Milo, I told you to keep rolling.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.221
Get the camera up and point it at me.

10:17.001 --> 10:18.491
At Briarcliff Manor...

10:18.569 --> 10:21.663
it's not uncommon to see patients
left on their own...

10:21.739 --> 10:24.640
without supervision,
without stimulation...

10:24.709 --> 10:27.234
for hours on end.

10:27.311 --> 10:33.079
The squalor, the filth,
the decay of this institution...

10:33.150 --> 10:37.052
is a shocking indictment
of the abandonment of her most needy...

10:37.121 --> 10:39.715
by the State of Massachusetts.

10:54.639 --> 10:57.665
Since then, conditions have deteriorated.

10:57.742 --> 11:02.076
The images and sounds are far more...

11:02.146 --> 11:04.512
- Ready? Do you need a slate?

11:04.582 --> 11:07.073

11:24.869 --> 11:28.066
Since then, conditions have deteriorated.

11:28.139 --> 11:31.404
These images and sounds
are far more powerful...

11:31.475 --> 11:34.103
than any words that can be spoken.

11:50.027 --> 11:53.758
But how can I describe to you
the way it smells?

11:53.831 --> 11:55.992
It reeks of filth, of disease.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.500
It smells of death.

11:57.568 --> 11:59.058
[Man]
Who are you?

12:00.771 --> 12:03.262
Do you... You have permission to do this?

12:03.340 --> 12:05.774
You are the first attendant we've seen
the entire time we've been here.

12:05.843 --> 12:09.279
Is it the policy to leave patients
unclothed and unclean...

12:09.346 --> 12:11.337
some of them smeared
in their own feces?

12:11.415 --> 12:13.906
Uh... I'm sorry. There's...
[Sighs]

12:13.984 --> 12:16.111
Just too many for us to take care of.

Judy Martin?

12:48.652 --> 12:50.244
Do you remember me?

12:53.791 --> 12:56.282
You were committed to Briarcliff
to cover up the abuses...

12:56.360 --> 12:59.557
the Church and science
had perpetrated against patients here.

12:59.630 --> 13:01.291
You were left to die...

13:01.365 --> 13:04.357
alone, abandoned.

I've come back to help you.

Jude was gone.</i>

13:47.745 --> 13:49.645
But you did shut down Briarcliff.

13:49.713 --> 13:53.240
Yes, but it's not the ending I wanted.

13:53.317 --> 13:55.979
It was one hell of an ending.

13:56.053 --> 13:58.044
Just not the one I wanted.

I need to freshen up.

Five and we're back.

- I'd love a sparkling water.

You shut down Briarcliff.

- Yeah.

I'd like to ask you.

- Yes. Like who's Betty Drake?

- When I was still trying to find Jude.

15:44.763 --> 15:48.130
But of course Jude
hadn't existed for years.

15:48.199 --> 15:49.632
The monsignor saw to that.

Betty Drake, released to the care
of Kit Walker, March 27, 1970.

16:14.693 --> 16:18.356
That was just a few months after you
came to see me at the book signing.

16:18.430 --> 16:20.864
It's Jude, isn't it?

16:22.033 --> 16:24.024
Why do you care now, Lana?

16:26.938 --> 16:29.304
Hmm?
We all just part of your story?

16:29.374 --> 16:32.502
It's not just my story, Kit.
It's yours too. And hers.

16:33.545 --> 16:35.945
You went back for her.

16:36.014 --> 16:37.538
Why?

16:41.353 --> 16:43.184
'Cause it was something I could do.

I couldn't shut the place down. I couldn't
lead them all out of there like Moses.

But, Jude, whatever she was...

she didn't belong there
any more than we did.

If shutting down Briarcliff
was such an undeniable success...

Everything that happened at Briarcliff
happened under your authority.

on murder, Cardinal Howard.
