11:08.534 --> 11:11.970
Not for all the applesauce
in Glückenschlabel.

11:13.739 --> 11:19.109
My dad could do it. He eats 50 dollars' won'th
of Powersauce bars a day.

11:19.211 --> 11:22.146
Overshoot the extreme.
Max the envelope and so on.

to our slogans.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.351
<i>Heroically,</i>
<i>I gave him the last short stack.</i>

12:42.661 --> 12:48.122
<i>Then that glory hog took all the supplies</i>
<i>and headed for the top alone.</i>

12:48.234 --> 12:50.794
[Screaming]

12:50.903 --> 12:55.602
I fell 8,000 feet onto
a pile of jagged rocks.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.541
Of course, folks were
tougher in those days.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.044
I was jitterbugging that very night.

13:01.147 --> 13:04.850
But that skunk McAllister
was never seen again.

13:04.850 --> 13:05.282
But that skunk McAllister
was never seen again.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.047
If you're trying to scare me,
it won't work.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.683
I'm 100% focused on my goal.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.591
Hey. My hat has earflaps.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.629
<i>And when he reaches the top,</i>
<i>Mr. Simpson here...</i>

13:18.731 --> 13:20.289
will plant this Powersauce
flag as an eternal symbol...

13:20.399 --> 13:22.128
of mars contempt for nature.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.668
Wait. Is "contempt"
the word I want here?

13:24.770 --> 13:27.295
Homer, you're the world's
greatest hero.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.340
Do you owe it all to Powersauce?

13:29.441 --> 13:31.341
That's right, Brad and Neil.

13:31.443 --> 13:35.209
I only eat Powersauce,
the bar with "applesauceicity."

13:35.314 --> 13:39.512
Has anyone mentioned that Homer
doesn't know anything about mountain climbing...

13:39.618 --> 13:41.643
and that this is all crazy?

13:41.754 --> 13:43.915
Well, yes. A number of people.
But don't worry.

13:44.023 --> 13:47.390
We're sending two Sherpas
along as guides.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.951
[Speaking Foreign Language]

13:51.063 --> 13:53.293
Aw. Good-bye, everyone.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.232
- Don't touch my stuff.
- Dad, wait.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.862
You're not risking your life
just to impress me, are you?

13:59.972 --> 14:01.940
Well, yeah.

14:02.041 --> 14:05.135
Oh, cool. Now get goir.
Chop-chop.

14:07.112 --> 14:10.206
Remember our agreement.
He can't fail.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.283
- <i>[Homer Wheezing]</i>
- <i>[Oxygen Hissing]</i>

14:18.390 --> 14:21.518
Oh, man. This is hard.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.595
Uh, Dad...

14:23.696 --> 14:27.097
shouldn't you save a couple bottles
for when you're a little higher?

14:29.401 --> 14:34.304
Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal
I have ever faced.

14:34.406 --> 14:38.137
Don't get discouraged, Dad.
Only four vertical miles to go.

14:38.244 --> 14:39.609
[Homer]
D'oh!

14:39.712 --> 14:41.680
[Snoring]

14:48.654 --> 14:50.622
[Both Grunting]

14:52.758 --> 14:54.726
[Roaring]

14:55.494 --> 14:57.894
Huh?

14:57.997 --> 15:00.090
[Sighs]

15:00.199 --> 15:02.667
Wow. Look how far I climbed.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.929
And I'm not even tired.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.473
- [Kicking]
- Wake up, you lazy Sherpas.
We've got a mountain to climb.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.065
[Foreign Language]

15:16.515 --> 15:20.110
This Powersauce newsbreak
is brought to you by Powersauce.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.052
Get sauced with Powersauce. Neil?

15:23.155 --> 15:27.216
Our top story: Homer Simpson
has just "powersauced" his way...

15:27.326 --> 15:30.193
past the halfway point
of the Murderhorn.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.856
Brad, could Homer
have made it this far...

15:32.965 --> 15:36.230
without the engineered nutrition
of six kinds of apples?

15:36.335 --> 15:38.667
No way, Neil.
Oh. This just in.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.568
Powersauce is amazing!

15:45.344 --> 15:49.576
[Mutters]
Huh? What the-

15:49.682 --> 15:52.651
Hey! You guys are dragging me
up the mountain.

15:54.053 --> 15:57.989
Brad and Neil
were quite insistent you not die.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.787
- Frankly, we don't care.
- So nobody believes I can do this, huh?

16:01.894 --> 16:05.125
Well, my son does.
And I'm not gonna let him down.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.960
I'm going to climb
this entire mountain on my own.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.764
Then technically shouldn't you
go back down and start all over?

16:11.870 --> 16:14.771
Shut up!
You are so fired!

16:14.873 --> 16:18.138
- Whoo-hoo!
- [Laughing]

16:20.279 --> 16:25.080
Homer Simpson here. I've sent the Sherpas home,
and I'm heading for the top- solo.

16:25.184 --> 16:27.175
Are you crazy?
You'll never make it.

16:27.286 --> 16:31.484
The hell I won't.
You're forgetting I've got my Powersauce bars.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.525
Wake up, Homer.
Those bars are just junk.

16:34.626 --> 16:37.322
They're made of apple cores
and Chinese newspapers.

16:37.429 --> 16:40.455
Hey. Deng Xiaoping died.

16:40.566 --> 16:44.263
[Neil]
Homer, listen to me. Turn back now!

16:44.370 --> 16:47.669
Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon.
Over and out.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.603
Homer Simpson,
defying all medical advice...

16:55.714 --> 17:00.048
has switched to Powersauce's archrival,
the Vita-Peach Health Log.

17:00.152 --> 17:03.952
Doctors say he may not have
the mega-nutrients needed to stave off death.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.786
Oh, Dad's gonna die,
and it's all my fault.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.883
I really need a good talking-to.

17:08.993 --> 17:11.791
Don't worry, kids.
Your father will be okay...

17:11.896 --> 17:15.333
- as long as he's with those Sherpas.
- Uh, Mom.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.272
[Groans]

17:24.376 --> 17:26.344
[Grunting]

17:26.444 --> 17:29.175
Eight.
[Panting]

17:31.717 --> 17:34.083
[Grunting]

17:34.186 --> 17:36.245
[Groans]
Air's getting thin.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.823
But I'm gonna make it.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.688
Ooh. Getting light-headed.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.355
Good.
No heavy head to carry.

17:45.464 --> 17:49.798
Wait. I'll just take that escalator.

17:52.037 --> 17:54.870
## [Humming]

17:57.976 --> 18:00.240
[Giggles]

18:03.082 --> 18:05.277

18:23.035 --> 18:25.003
D'oh!

18:28.006 --> 18:30.566
[Grunting]

18:30.676 --> 18:34.874
Just a few feet more.

18:45.757 --> 18:49.853
I did it.
I made it all the way to-

18:49.962 --> 18:52.157
Aw, crap!

18:52.264 --> 18:57.065
It just keeps going!
[Sobbing] I give up.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.137
You beat me, mountain!

19:02.808 --> 19:06.244
[Sighs]
At least I won't freeze to death.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.877
[Yelps]

19:12.985 --> 19:16.182
"Last entry: I have mountaineered
to the utmost...

19:16.288 --> 19:18.222
"but the peak is unclimbable.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.883
"Worse still, that treacherous skunk,
Abe Simpson...

19:20.993 --> 19:24.224
stole my oxygen
and tried to eat my left arm."

19:24.329 --> 19:26.695
<i>Ew, Dad!</i>

"Tell my beloved wife

My dad's a disgrace, just like Bart's dad!

19:39.978 --> 19:42.776
Me!
[Sobs]

19:47.452 --> 19:53.015
This may not be the top,
but it's as close as a Simpsors ever gonna get.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.116
This is for you, Son.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.752
[Grunting]

20:02.768 --> 20:05.464
[Gasping]

20:12.477 --> 20:14.445
Uh-oh. Hey.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.446
Wait a minute.

20:16.548 --> 20:20.279
I'm on the top.
I actually did it!

20:20.385 --> 20:22.649
I climbed the unclimbable mountain!

20:22.754 --> 20:28.249
Bow down before me, everyone,
for I am your king!

20:31.063 --> 20:33.588
Family to Dad.
Family to Dad.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.896
- Come in, Dad.
- Uh, I'm pretty sure he's dead, little girl.

20:37.002 --> 20:39.869
Here. Have a Powersauce bar.
It's on the house.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.270
Hey. Something's comir down
the mountain- fast!

20:42.374 --> 20:45.400
<i>Oh, no! He fell!</i>
<i>I can't look!</i>

20:45.510 --> 20:48.138
[Faint Shouting]

20:54.019 --> 20:57.887
- Hi.
- Oh, Homie! You're alive!

20:57.990 --> 21:01.255
Oh, Marge.
I never thought you'd see me again.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.329
Where in the world
did you find a sled on top of the-

21:04.429 --> 21:06.329
[Screams]

21:06.431 --> 21:09.958
- [All Gasping]
- We're too late. He's dead.

21:11.236 --> 21:13.261
It looks like
someone tried to eat him.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.339
What are you looking at me for?

21:16.441 --> 21:19.638
You're all crazy.
Crazy as a-

21:22.948 --> 21:26.281
Okay. Here's what I think happened.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.018
Did you make it
to the top, Dad? Huh? Did ya?

21:31.123 --> 21:33.956
Why don't you tell me, Son?

21:34.059 --> 21:36.755
See any interesting flags up there?

21:36.862 --> 21:39.763
<i>All I see is a pole.</i>
<i>Maybe the flag fell off.</i>

21:39.865 --> 21:41.833
Ah, damn it!

21:41.933 --> 21:44.493
Forget about it, Homer.
You made it to the top.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.628
<i>You're the coolest dad ever.</i>

21:46.738 --> 21:50.367
Thanks, Bart.
That makes it all won'thwhile.

- Is that your wallet?
