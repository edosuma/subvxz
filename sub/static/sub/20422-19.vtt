00:05.620 --> 00:10.990
I doubt even Shiroe predicted this.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.780
Looks like I won't be able to watch 
over them from hiding anymore.

01:56.440 --> 02:02.750
Normally, when you're expecting an attack 
on a population center like a city,

02:02.750 --> 02:05.710
you should try to take the fight 
as far away from it as possible.

02:05.710 --> 02:06.890
I understand.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.950
Even if you succeed in repelling them,

02:08.950 --> 02:14.580
the damage to the city and surroundings 
could make life after the battle very difficult.

02:15.850 --> 02:16.740
Yes!

02:16.740 --> 02:22.060
We can't use telepathy, so keep your party 
chat open and bring Isuzu here.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.080

but there are so many...</i>

02:39.880 --> 02:41.760

02:42.270 --> 02:44.390
Will Roe 2 be okay?

02:44.820 --> 02:47.610
She's stronger than we are!

02:47.610 --> 02:49.390
This way! Hurry!

02:49.390 --> 02:50.660
Don't let go of my hand.

02:50.660 --> 02:51.900
Come on, hurry!

02:52.430 --> 02:53.790
Serara?

02:53.790 --> 02:56.050
They're surprisingly calm.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.470
Come to think of it...

02:59.590 --> 03:01.260
The Odyssey Knights...

03:02.060 --> 03:04.160
They're going to fight the wyverns.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.660
That's why the townspeople aren't worried.

03:08.380 --> 03:09.660
We should hurry, too!

03:23.720 --> 03:24.930
Miss Isuzu...

03:24.930 --> 03:26.010
Miss Isuzu?

03:45.440 --> 03:48.410
I wonder if the battle's already started.

03:51.450 --> 03:52.730
Miss Isuzu?

03:52.730 --> 03:53.920
What?

03:56.430 --> 03:59.920
As long as I, Rundel Haus Code, 
am here, it'll be okay!

04:00.280 --> 04:04.680
The town of Safil, Miss Minori, 
Miss Serara, and you, Miss Isuzu...

04:05.160 --> 04:08.600
The passionate light of my orb of love willâ€”

04:10.420 --> 04:12.970
Now isn't the time to screw around!

04:14.750 --> 04:15.930
Miss Isuzu...

04:15.930 --> 04:17.110
What now?

04:22.190 --> 04:23.570
Wh-What is this?

04:23.570 --> 04:25.370
A Skylark Shoes spell.

04:25.790 --> 04:29.220
At my level, you can't fly,

04:29.220 --> 04:32.310
but it'll raise your movement speed 
regardless of bad terrain.

04:32.310 --> 04:34.040
So I'll be faster?

04:34.040 --> 04:34.870
Indeed.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.600
This is great!

04:37.600 --> 04:39.380
I'm a genius, you know!

04:39.860 --> 04:41.610
Don't get cocky.

04:44.390 --> 04:45.290
Let's go!

04:45.290 --> 04:45.980
Yeah!

04:53.400 --> 04:54.560
What is this?

04:57.540 --> 04:58.570
What's going on?

04:58.570 --> 05:00.570
Over here! Look at me!

05:00.020 --> 05:01.370
Over here!

05:03.770 --> 05:06.200
Tohya... Tohya...

05:12.580 --> 05:14.130
Look over here!

05:15.580 --> 05:17.580
My turn next!

05:17.580 --> 05:19.590
<i>Anchor Howl!</i>

05:19.830 --> 05:21.070
Wow, Shunichi!

05:21.070 --> 05:22.170
Let me play, too!

05:21.680 --> 05:22.710
Me, too!

05:24.610 --> 05:28.160
There's no plan, no teamwork... Nothing!

05:28.160 --> 05:29.220
This is crazy.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.140
They're building up as much aggro as they can.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.730
What is this?

05:34.320 --> 05:36.480
What are they doing?

05:36.990 --> 05:37.980
I'm here!

05:38.410 --> 05:40.480
Now, take me!

05:46.480 --> 05:47.330
Damn.

05:47.330 --> 05:48.490
I'm back already.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.890
Go! Go!

05:49.890 --> 05:51.220
This is my third time.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.770
I'm jealous of your paper-thin armor.

05:52.830 --> 05:53.770
What is this?

05:54.250 --> 05:55.500
What are they doing?

05:56.570 --> 05:59.500
That's an interesting idea.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.500
That's a revival device...

06:03.260 --> 06:04.920
Just like the Cathedral,

06:04.920 --> 06:07.510
it acts as a beacon for people 
who are coming back to life.

06:07.860 --> 06:11.230
Someone must have invented it. 
Quite impressive.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.000
Sis Roe 2?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.630
You look pale, young Tohya.

06:15.630 --> 06:17.150
What are you talking about?

06:17.150 --> 06:18.560
"Interesting"?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.240
That's wrong!

06:20.240 --> 06:21.060
It's insane!

06:21.060 --> 06:22.770
No, it's not insane at all.

06:23.950 --> 06:26.530
It's acting in accordance with this world's laws.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.690
That's not what I meant!

06:28.690 --> 06:33.730
And from the look of it, they seem 
quite willing to donate empathion.

06:34.580 --> 06:37.750
If they keep dying that often, 
the gathering efficiency will go up a lot.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.670
It's probably a big help to Genius.

06:39.670 --> 06:41.130
What are you saying?!

06:41.610 --> 06:42.840
They're dying!

06:42.840 --> 06:44.560
We have to do something!

06:44.560 --> 06:48.340
They seem to be quite willing, to me.

06:49.190 --> 06:51.340
They desire death.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.350
Their life flashing before their eyes, like a drug.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.850
To be honest, I don't really get it.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.000
This is Londark.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.620
Nothing out of the order in the area.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.080
The magic railways are functioning well, too.

07:27.650 --> 07:30.000

They don't need to do that at all.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.650

07:41.650 --> 07:42.650
Yes, ma'am.

Her condition is stable.

07:45.470 --> 07:47.280
Okay, activating.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.650
I'll start synchronization with unit 20.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.650
Beginning EXP monitoring.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.800
Opening party chat.

07:58.430 --> 08:00.220
So it's complete?

08:00.220 --> 08:02.730
We summon nightshade servants that act as vessels

08:02.730 --> 08:05.420
for the minds of People of the Land.

08:05.420 --> 08:10.610
And the experience points they gain 
go to the summoner, right?

08:10.610 --> 08:11.420
Seriously?

08:11.850 --> 08:17.500
Of course, even if the servant dies, 
it doesn't affect them at all.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.420
In other words, we're giving the People 
of the Land temporary immortality.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.820
The way you laugh is creepy.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.400
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking, kid!

08:30.980 --> 08:31.890
Shut up.

08:31.660 --> 08:33.560
Ow. Ow. Ow.

08:32.350 --> 08:34.590
So you use this to raise levels?

08:34.590 --> 08:36.470
That's pretty efficient...

08:34.590 --> 08:37.020
Heh heh, this is fun.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.330
It is not!

08:38.580 --> 08:39.790
Interesting.

08:39.790 --> 08:44.330
You adventurers would call it "power leveling."

08:46.250 --> 08:47.250
Roger.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.090
In ten minutes, we'll begin injecting EXP pots.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.090
That's dangerous! Stop!

08:52.550 --> 08:56.590
Miss Mizufa, Kazuhiko is requesting 
that the injections be stopped.

08:56.590 --> 08:59.100
Who cares about that hypocrite?

08:59.510 --> 09:01.190
They're adventurers.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.910
We're People of the Land.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.600
What do immortals know of war?

09:07.400 --> 09:09.860
It's where you go to die.

09:10.830 --> 09:11.720
Right?

09:13.350 --> 09:18.870
I don't understand why you people have 
created such an inefficient society.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.410
Hey, what's that?

09:20.410 --> 09:21.370
What are you doing?

09:21.370 --> 09:23.620
Nightshade servants?

09:23.850 --> 09:25.280
Where did they come from?

09:25.280 --> 09:27.640
No! Protect our shrine!

09:29.230 --> 09:30.890
But when it comes to that,

09:30.890 --> 09:34.430
the knowable world is far smaller 
than the unknowable one.

09:36.360 --> 09:40.130
The sum of what we can understand isn't 
much bigger than the head of a pin.

09:40.130 --> 09:44.220
So it isn't strange at all that I wouldn't 
understand something, but...

09:44.220 --> 09:44.960

Huh?

10:52.770 --> 10:54.600
What were those things?

10:54.600 --> 10:56.070
They just showed up out of nowhere.

10:56.070 --> 10:58.660

no sign of their psyche dissipating.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.830
But in this world, there is no death.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.300
It's impossible to take your own life.

She's a real handful, that girl...

13:48.850 --> 13:51.940
She complains every day, because she 
wants to leave her parents' house.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.100

14:24.030 --> 14:27.490
A world like that can't be real!

14:29.980 --> 14:32.890
It's because people like you keep living...

14:33.560 --> 14:35.390
Because not everyone is dying...

14:36.400 --> 14:39.570
That we can't leave this world!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.530
Is it that important

14:46.690 --> 14:49.030
whether you can die or not?

14:59.200 --> 15:00.660
Hey, are you okay?

15:00.660 --> 15:02.120
Get an ambulance!

15:02.120 --> 15:04.410
The driver's not going to make it...

15:08.620 --> 15:09.570
Tohya!

15:09.570 --> 15:10.550
Can you see me?

15:10.550 --> 15:11.550
It's Minori!

15:20.740 --> 15:25.070
Have you ever died?

15:25.720 --> 15:29.630
Did you ever die in the old world?

15:30.960 --> 15:35.390
Were you ever so close to 
death that you may as well

15:38.430 --> 15:39.710
have been dead?

15:41.830 --> 15:44.640
If you've got a problem with me, call the GMs.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.460
If I'm at fault, they'll ban me.

15:47.130 --> 15:51.470
Otherwise, you die, too.

15:55.270 --> 15:57.680
I mean, I understand...

15:57.680 --> 15:59.560
I understand wanting to go home.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.150
But...

16:03.050 --> 16:04.270
Miss Isuzu...

16:06.880 --> 16:10.220
Even so... Even so, we...

16:14.470 --> 16:15.500
That's right.

16:16.660 --> 16:20.090
Everyone... Everyone... Everyone...

16:21.680 --> 16:23.110
is alive in this world.

16:29.760 --> 16:33.780
<i>Even after he couldn't walk anymore, 
Tohya was always smiling.</i>

16:34.750 --> 16:35.620
<i>But...</i>

16:36.260 --> 16:39.270
<i>It was because he knew he was powerless.</i>

16:40.290 --> 16:43.760
<i>The world was just too big, too unfair.</i>

16:44.220 --> 16:46.770
<i>And there was nothing we could do.</i>

16:47.480 --> 16:48.910
<i>That was why...</i>

16:48.910 --> 16:52.020
<i>Because he knew that, he tried so hard.</i>

16:57.140 --> 16:58.490
<i>And even now...</i>

17:01.590 --> 17:03.500
Tohya is crying out.

17:04.130 --> 17:09.060
Serara is casting Heartbeat Healing on 
every Person of the Land she can find.

17:09.630 --> 17:11.260
Isuzu and Rundel Haus are

17:11.260 --> 17:14.510
protecting the people of the town, 
as they come this way.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.620
But even so, there's nothing that can be done.

17:21.880 --> 17:26.020
If you're asking me in a place like this, 
you must know the answer, right?

17:27.590 --> 17:29.260
Who are you?

17:29.690 --> 17:31.530
And who am I?

17:32.430 --> 17:33.720
Where have I come from?

17:33.720 --> 17:34.860
Where am I going?

17:36.800 --> 17:39.630
After yesterday, I kept thinking about that.

17:40.790 --> 17:45.980
I thought and thought, but I couldn't find an answer.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.320
I just couldn't get over it.

17:48.890 --> 17:51.140
I couldn't resolve myself to it...

17:51.830 --> 17:53.470
Miss Isuzu...

17:53.470 --> 17:56.790
But I was lucky, wasn't I?

17:56.790 --> 17:58.290
To be born in that world,

17:58.290 --> 18:00.180
to be born to my dad?

18:01.070 --> 18:04.660
Because there was music there.

18:04.660 --> 18:09.670
When I was sad, when I was in pain, 
there were so many different songs.

18:11.570 --> 18:14.380
I've always been helped by 
someone else, haven't I?

18:14.870 --> 18:17.120
Yet, this is so terrible...

18:18.040 --> 18:19.990
Only forty-two?

18:19.990 --> 18:21.210
That's terrible.

18:21.210 --> 18:24.190
To be unable to sing when you want to cry,

18:24.190 --> 18:26.670
when you're angry, when you're having fun...

18:27.110 --> 18:28.320
Miss Isuzu...

18:28.670 --> 18:29.660
That's why...

18:31.120 --> 18:32.750
Wh-What's the matter?

18:32.750 --> 18:34.150
Let's go, Rudy!

18:34.150 --> 18:35.840
Go where?

18:38.230 --> 18:40.220
Where are we going and why?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.370
We're going to pick a fight.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.480
A fight?

18:42.480 --> 18:47.310
We're going to pick a fight with the god who 
only made forty-two songs in the world!

18:47.310 --> 18:50.630
I'm not going to stop until they cry and apologize!

18:51.150 --> 18:53.580
Wait, Miss Isuzu!

18:55.000 --> 18:57.120
<i>Who is Roe 2?</i>

18:57.120 --> 18:58.320
<i>Is that</i>

18:59.210 --> 19:02.830
<i>what I really want to know?</i>

19:03.510 --> 19:06.380
<i>No, that doesn't matter.</i>

19:06.820 --> 19:09.700
<i>No matter who she is, 
I want to be friends with her.</i>

19:10.160 --> 19:12.340
<i>That's all.</i>

19:14.570 --> 19:17.680
<i>So I... Who am I?</i>

19:18.380 --> 19:19.630
<i>Where am I going?</i>

19:20.340 --> 19:21.340
<i>Is that...</i>

19:22.260 --> 19:23.780
My wish?

19:27.250 --> 19:28.350
<i>Isuzu?</i>

19:27.660 --> 19:35.080
<i>At some point the rain stopped, 
and the town began to sparkle.</i>

19:29.570 --> 19:30.370
<i>A song?</i>

19:32.120 --> 19:34.750
<i>That's Isuzu's wish.</i>

19:35.080 --> 19:42.320
<i>A huge rainbow stands over all the buildings.</i>

19:35.230 --> 19:37.860
<i>Then my wish is...</i>

19:41.550 --> 19:42.660
<i>Shiroe?</i>

19:42.320 --> 19:45.810
<i>Right now, more than anyone else,</i>

19:45.810 --> 19:49.700
<i>I want to show this scenery to you first.</i>

19:49.700 --> 19:54.820
<i>My heartbeat is fluttering.</i>

19:50.920 --> 19:54.310
<i>I want to be a person who can 
open new paths, like Shiroe!</i>

19:54.820 --> 20:03.200
<i>Come on! The magic will never fade, even now.</i>

19:57.860 --> 19:59.720
I am Shiroe's student.

20:00.260 --> 20:03.220
And you are our big sister.

20:03.200 --> 20:10.320
<i>Don't be afraid of boredom, 
and let's, let's, let's go out!</i>

20:03.670 --> 20:06.650
You came from far away, 
and you're going far away.

20:06.650 --> 20:09.850
But right now, you're here, with us!

20:10.320 --> 20:13.330
<i>Yes, what a wonderful Wonder World!</i>

20:13.330 --> 20:16.860
<i>To a place we've never seen before,</i>

20:16.860 --> 20:25.090
<i>I'll take your hand, 
so let's go there now together.</i>

20:18.120 --> 20:20.860
On this battlefield, that's your answer?

20:21.540 --> 20:24.280
On this battlefield, this is my answer.

20:25.090 --> 20:28.090
<i>Such a wonderful Wonder World</i>

20:25.460 --> 20:28.000
Even if nothing changes?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.390
I can change some things.

20:28.090 --> 20:31.730
<i>Is scattered all around this town, too.</i>

20:30.940 --> 20:33.350
At a time like this, when Tohya 
is lying on the ground?

20:31.730 --> 20:42.150
<i>Even if the future worries me,
if I'm with you, what a wonder it is!</i>

20:33.720 --> 20:35.390
He'll stand up soon.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.820
I doubt your words will be heard.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.180
But you're with us now.

20:43.820 --> 20:46.010
I heard your wish.

20:46.770 --> 20:47.760
Yes.

20:48.850 --> 20:50.390
I like that, Minori.

20:50.390 --> 20:51.460
I like it...

20:51.460 --> 20:53.860
I'm your big sister, after all!

20:53.860 --> 20:54.770
Yes.

20:55.530 --> 20:56.530
<i>Summon.</i>

21:01.130 --> 21:05.280
Yes, we have a duty, as those who go ahead.

21:05.750 --> 21:10.790
It would be very uncool of me to knock 
away the hand you're reaching out.

21:11.330 --> 21:14.320
A big sister never abandons her little sister!

21:17.930 --> 21:22.250
An element cluster gets more 
stable the bigger it gets.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.160
But it also behaves in a deterministic manner.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.800
And as it does so, it loses little fragments.

21:28.490 --> 21:29.880
That's not a bad thing.

21:30.390 --> 21:34.020
It's natural to want all of humanity to be happy.

21:34.020 --> 21:37.560
But that, in the end, is the beginning of sorrow.

21:38.420 --> 21:39.550
You don't understand?

21:39.550 --> 21:40.330
No.

21:41.010 --> 21:43.650
Your words are so inconvenient.

21:44.070 --> 21:48.770
This limited protocol even limits the upper 
bounds of your thinking organs.

21:49.650 --> 21:54.650
You live inside this unfair loneliness, 
like it's the stone age?

21:54.650 --> 21:56.330
That's unbelievable...

21:56.700 --> 21:59.780
But the empathions are shared.

22:00.480 --> 22:04.080
This is your style, right?

22:17.680 --> 22:19.780
Miss Shogun,

22:19.780 --> 22:22.200
your servants are being attacked.

22:22.200 --> 22:22.980
What?

22:23.810 --> 22:24.570
What's going on?

22:29.940 --> 22:32.220
So we meet here?

24:05.900 --> 24:07.730
Londark stands in the way.

24:07.730 --> 24:11.130
He, too, is forced into action by the 
twisted thoughts of this world.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.550
Why are we here?

24:13.550 --> 24:15.890
Nyanta cannot answer that question.

24:15.890 --> 24:20.070
Tohya, Isuzu, and the young children 
struggle as hard as they can

24:20.070 --> 24:21.780
to find the answer.

24:22.350 --> 24:24.250
Next time: Birthday Song.

24:22.350 --> 24:29.940
<b>Birthday Song</b>

24:24.770 --> 24:26.720
I have friends to run with me.
