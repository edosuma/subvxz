Previously on the secret life of
the american teenager:

00:02.635 --> 00:03.800
Oh, boy.

00:03.835 --> 00:05.600
Mama's got on
her power suit again.

00:05.635 --> 00:07.500
I am going to get a job,
and when I get a job,

00:07.535 --> 00:10.500
I'm gonna proceed with the divorce,
and you are going to be moving.

00:10.535 --> 00:14.055
- So, Amy,back to looking for a job, huh?
- Are you talking about you or me?

00:14.090 --> 00:16.100
If you don't have a family
to adopt, you need a job.

00:16.135 --> 00:17.900
and without your father
I need to???

00:17.935 --> 00:19.810
I don't have money
so I would not make

00:19.845 --> 00:22.300
the best father for the baby
or the best husband for Amy,

00:22.335 --> 00:25.800
so you and Amy have a nice life
with my son. You win, oun.

00:25.835 --> 00:28.300
- I'm not having s again until I'm married.
- How???

00:28.335 --> 00:31.900
- I'm reclaiming my virginity.
- Maybe I'd like to reclaim mine with you.

00:31.935 --> 00:33.400
By having sex with you?

00:33.435 --> 00:35.900
I'm the architect on the
renovation across e street.

00:35.935 --> 00:37.300
- You should give me a call.
- Okay.

00:37.335 --> 00:41.400
If you choose to keep the baby,
????

00:41.435 --> 00:44.100
Are you out of your mind,Benjamin?
You don't have a dime.

00:44.135 --> 00:47.100
You get your butt up, and get in
that kitchen and help her out.

00:47.135 --> 00:48.700
And tomorrow
start looking for a job.

00:48.735 --> 00:51.700
Hey, you wanna beat that guy up who was
flirting with Anne on the way to the car?

00:51.735 --> 00:53.700
Come on. Let's go.

* I know a weenie man
He owns a weenie stand *

01:14.335 --> 01:16.800
* He owns everything
From hot dogs on down *

01:16.835 --> 01:19.100
* Some day I'll be his wife
His little weenie wife *

01:19.135 --> 01:22.100
* Oh, how I love
That hot dog man *

01:23.000 --> 01:25.700
-Jealous?
- Guy who owns the weenie stand?

01:25.735 --> 01:28.000
You know who I'm talking about.
I know you saw him.

01:28.035 --> 01:30.500
- Saw who?
- The customer behind you.

01:30.535 --> 01:32.200
The one who was flirting with me?

01:32.235 --> 01:34.941
And he doesn't own the weenie stand.
He's an architect.

01:34.976 --> 01:37.000
He's renovating the building
across from the stand.

01:37.035 --> 01:39.500
- So he didn't build the stand?
- No. He did not.

01:39.535 --> 01:42.900
He owns his own architectural firm,
where I have an interview this morning.

01:42.935 --> 01:45.200
And if I get the job,
the first paycheck I get

01:45.235 --> 01:46.800
is going straight to the attorney.

01:46.835 --> 01:49.700
Could he possibly be David
Johnson of J&J Architects?

01:49.735 --> 01:52.000
- How would you know that?
-??? Because I snapped a picture of him.

01:52.035 --> 01:55.600
- Mutual friends told me about him.
- Oh. What'd they tell you?

01:55.635 --> 01:58.000
That he's younger, better-looking
and more successful than you are?

01:58.035 --> 02:01.100
Yeah, he's a talented.
Gay, and very talented.

02:01.135 --> 02:03.300
I hate to break the news,
but your new boyfriend is gay.

02:03.335 --> 02:05.700
- And he's deaf in one ear.
- You're making that up.

02:05.735 --> 02:08.100
It is David Johnson
of J&J Architects, isn't it?

02:08.134 --> 02:09.500
Wanna call Donovan
and get the scoop?

02:09.535 --> 02:11.900
No, I don't have time.
I have to go.

02:11.935 --> 02:14.200
You're taking the girls
to school and picking them up.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.600
After I meet with a guy
who I know is not gay

02:16.635 --> 02:17.900
????

02:17.935 --> 02:20.881
??who has some couples lined up.
???

02:20.916 --> 02:22.000
This time I'm going to them.

02:22.035 --> 02:23.800
I don't think Amy wants
to have the baby adopted.

02:23.835 --> 02:24.900
Well, that's up to Amy,

02:24.935 --> 02:28.000
and I don't wantn'nyone
interfering with her decision.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.500
Gay and deaf in one ear.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.400
You're an idiot.

02:34.435 --> 02:35.900
Figure skating injury.

02:35.935 --> 02:37.800
Spun into a wall
doing a triple salchow.

02:37.835 --> 02:39.500
Shattered the ear drum.
Donovan told me.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.200
George, you are so lying.

02:41.235 --> 02:44.600
How would I know anything about
a salchow if Donovan hadn't told me?

02:55.700 --> 02:58.200
Hey, Donovan, buddy, listen,
uh, if Anne calls you,

02:58.235 --> 02:59.600
don't take the call,
all right?

02:59.635 --> 03:01.200
And pass that on to Leon.

03:01.235 --> 03:02.900
Okay, thanks, buddy.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.900
Hey. Oh, hey.
Did you find a job?

03:07.935 --> 03:09.100
Did I find a job?

03:09.135 --> 03:12.000
- Yeah. Did you find a job?
- Not a real job.

03:12.035 --> 03:14.800
However, uh,
I am more than happy to continue

03:14.835 --> 03:16.800
to help out
around the house anytime.

03:16.835 --> 03:19.500
You're not gonna have time.
I found the job for you.

03:19.535 --> 03:21.800
Dad, come on, you're not gonna
drag me down to the office

03:21.835 --> 03:24.300
to make me pretend
to work for you there, are you?

03:24.335 --> 03:26.600
No. I'm gonna take you
down to Boykewich's Butchers

03:26.635 --> 03:28.500
and let you get your hands dirty.

03:28.535 --> 03:30.800
Okay, Dad, if, um,
if that's a threat,

03:30.835 --> 03:32.900
I'll get a job. A real job.
I promise.

03:32.935 --> 03:34.800
It's not a threat.
It's an opportunity.

03:34.835 --> 03:37.800
To make some money. And to make,
uh, some new friends.

03:37.835 --> 03:40.600
I have friends. And,
come on, I have money.

03:40.635 --> 03:42.800
You do?
We?, that's news to me.

03:42.835 --> 03:43.800
The trust fund?

03:43.835 --> 03:46.900
Oh, at. No, you can't get any money
out of that till you're 21.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.500
The kid'll be in school by then.

03:48.535 --> 03:51.000
And you know what,
now that you brought it up,

03:51.035 --> 03:53.200
that trust fund,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.100
I'm making it 30.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.000
You can tap into it
when you're 30.

03:57.035 --> 03:58.300
- Dad--
- Forty.

03:58.335 --> 04:00.600
And just so you know, I'm going
to offer a job to Ricky too.

04:00.635 --> 04:03.300
I think it'd be good if the two
of you could work together.

04:03.335 --> 04:06.400
I figure one of you have to
take care of Amy and the baby.

04:06.435 --> 04:08.200
One or both of you.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.200
Here's the bus schedule.

04:10.235 --> 04:11.900
Be there at 3:30.

04:11.935 --> 04:15.200
And you're very welcome
for the opportunity.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.900
Don't mess with the King.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.600
- How'd it go?
- One down, e do go.

04:32.635 --> 04:35.800
-  Thanks, Leo.
- No problem.???

04:35.835 --> 04:39.200
-It's my grandson.
- Yeah, I know.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.300
I'll see you, George.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.300
Yes.

04:59.249 --> 05:00.949
the secret life of the american teenager s01e20

05:09.300 --> 05:11.400
Someone's in a good mood
this morning.

05:11.435 --> 05:12.800
You and Mom in the garage again?

05:12.835 --> 05:15.600
Ashley, garage time is over.
Your mom's got a boyfriend.

05:15.635 --> 05:17.000
- She does not.
- Afraid so.

05:17.035 --> 05:19.300
Some architect hit on her
at the weenie stand.

05:19.335 --> 05:21.600
And this morning, she has
an interview with him.

05:21.635 --> 05:23.583
Although the interview
will be a challenge for her,

05:23.618 --> 05:24.800
???
he will hire her,

05:24.835 --> 05:27.400
this'll be the beginning of the end of
our marriage as we know it.

05:27.435 --> 05:29.603
He is the architect of our demise.

05:29.835 --> 05:30.900
Chocolate chip waffle?

05:30.935 --> 05:32.700
Yeah, thanks.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.100
But if she brings him home,
I'll kill him.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.100
I know you will, pumpkin.

05:37.135 --> 05:40.800
No time for waffles.
We're gonna be late for school.

05:43.100 --> 05:46.600
And by the way, Ashley, yogurt is
healthier than chocolate chip waffles.

05:46.635 --> 05:48.500
Pregnant girl is concerned
about being tardy?

05:48.535 --> 05:50.900
Yes. And I'm concerned
about your health.

05:50.935 --> 05:54.500
Until and unless I'm living in
your stomach, leave my health to me.

05:54.535 --> 05:56.300
Morning, Ames. How's the baby?

05:56.335 --> 05:59.900
He's fine. He's jumping around
a lot this morning.

05:59.935 --> 06:02.900
I think he's in a hurry
to get to school.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.200
Do not stop talking about that baby
until you're out of the car.

06:08.235 --> 06:09.886
Like you have to tell me that?

06:13.300 --> 06:15.300
Good morning.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.800
What do you want?

06:16.835 --> 06:18.300
I don't want anything,

06:18.335 --> 06:21.600
however, uh,my dad's in the hallway,
and he'd like to speak to you.

06:21.635 --> 06:23.200
About what? What did I do?

06:23.235 --> 06:26.100
It's not so much what you did
as what I did.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.600
I believe I offered
to take care of the baby,

06:28.635 --> 06:29.700
and as it turns out,

06:29.735 --> 06:32.100
I don't have the means
to take care of the baby.

06:32.135 --> 06:35.300
So we're in the same
unfortunate position.

06:35.335 --> 06:36.800
- Broke.
- Speak English.

06:36.835 --> 06:38.500
My dad wants to offer you a job,

06:38.535 --> 06:39.900
but you don't have to take it.

06:39.935 --> 06:42.300
And in fact,
I encourage you to say no.

06:42.335 --> 06:46.000
He can't make you do anything.
He's not really a King.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.000
I heard that,
Benjamin.

06:48.035 --> 06:50.300
And you know what,
you're not a prince.

06:50.335 --> 06:52.800
So be at the butcher shop
at 3:30 like I said.

06:52.835 --> 06:55.600
Is that the job? Working at your
butcher shop with Ben?

06:55.635 --> 06:57.800
Have a problem with that?
Working at the butcher shop?

06:57.835 --> 07:01.700
No, sir. I don't.
I mean, I'd love a job.Thank you.

07:01.735 --> 07:04.700
I have a car.I can drive us.
We'll be there at 3:30.

07:04.735 --> 07:06.400
Don't be late.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.000
I'm gonna have Amy, the baby,

07:10.035 --> 07:14.400
and your dad over to my side
before you can say "pork chop."

07:20.000 --> 07:23.100
Hey, guess what.
I got a job.

07:23.135 --> 07:24.300
A job? Why?

07:24.335 --> 07:26.200
I'm still looking for a couple
to adopt the baby.

07:26.235 --> 07:27.800
And I thought you didn't want a job.

07:27.835 --> 07:30.200
I didn't,
but someone offered me a job.

07:30.235 --> 07:32.100
And now I can help out
with the baby.

07:32.135 --> 07:35.500
And if you don't find a couple,
at least I can  contribute something.

07:35.535 --> 07:36.900
If you wanna keep the baby.

07:36.935 --> 07:39.300
It's not a matter
of whether I want to or not.

07:39.335 --> 07:40.900
It's a matter
of what's best for him.

07:40.935 --> 07:43.700
Yeah, I know. Okay,
well...

07:43.800 --> 07:46.000
I'll talk to you later Amy.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.500
Ricky got a job.

07:49.535 --> 07:50.500
Yeah. Me too.

07:50.535 --> 07:51.900
You did? Where?

07:51.935 --> 07:54.100
At, uh,
my dad's butcher shop.

07:54.135 --> 07:55.800
He got me and Rickyjob there.

07:55.835 --> 07:58.500
Are you his boss?
What?

07:58.535 --> 08:01.500
This is kind of the first time
I've realized the King is the King

08:01.535 --> 08:03.100
and not Santa Claus.

08:03.135 --> 08:06.200
- This is all my fault.
- No, no, no. It's-- my fault.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.000
When you treat a privilege
as though it's a right,

08:08.035 --> 08:10.600
you lose it.
I lost my privileges,

08:10.635 --> 08:12.600
but you, however,
gained the possibility

08:12.635 --> 08:15.600
of financial support
from not one, but two sources.

08:15.635 --> 08:17.700
Not to mention CR meat.

08:17.735 --> 08:19.700
So you can quit your job
at the hot dog stand.

08:19.735 --> 08:21.400
I think I'll be able
to quit anyway.

08:21.435 --> 08:22.900
Uh, my momay be getting a real job,

08:22.935 --> 08:26.000
so the translator position
won't be availbelemore.

08:26.035 --> 08:29.400
I have to get to the library,
but I'll see you after school.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.799
Right, um,
I won't see you after school,

08:32.835 --> 08:36.200
but good luck with the job.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.400
Did she say "job"?

08:41.434 --> 08:45.500
dad got me and Ricky a job working together
at the family butcher shop.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.500
Yeah. I know.

08:47.535 --> 08:49.200
- What are we? Chopped meat?
- Huh?

08:49.235 --> 08:52.000
I think that what she means is,
why not the two of us?

08:52.035 --> 08:54.100
You guys wanna work
at the butcher shop?

08:54.135 --> 08:55.200
-No.
- Kind of.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.700
Why didn't he offer us jobs?

08:56.735 --> 08:59.500
Because I think that he wants
me and Ricky to become friends.

08:59.535 --> 09:03.000
And that he also wants to show me
what it's like to support a child.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.600
You left your lunch
in the car.

09:05.635 --> 09:07.300
- Thanks.
- And, uh,

09:07.335 --> 09:10.300
do you ever look around
before you speak?

09:10.400 --> 09:13.400
Hey, you two, how you been?
Haven't seen you around.

09:13.435 --> 09:14.800
Is that why you
didn't offer us jobs?

09:14.835 --> 09:17.700
We're still Ben's best friends
although our relationship is sketchy.

09:17.735 --> 09:20.100
You want a job? I'll look for
a job in the factory for you.

09:20.135 --> 09:22.300
Wanna make sausage?

09:22.700 --> 09:24.300
Yeah, I thought so.

09:24.335 --> 09:27.400
Dad, this whole job thing,
it's so unnecessary.

09:27.435 --> 09:29.500
I mean, Amy's gonna have
the baby adopted.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.400
I thought you didn't
want her to.???

09:31.435 --> 09:34.000
- Well, I don't.
- Then do something about that.

09:34.035 --> 09:36.000
Like do your job.
Earn a paycheck.

09:36.035 --> 09:38.500
Offer to help.
With your own money.

09:38.535 --> 09:41.900
???
Stop leaving your lunch in the car.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.300
I miss you guys.
Come around any time, okay?

09:45.335 --> 09:48.600
Gotta get to work, otherwise
nobody's gonna have a job.

09:48.635 --> 09:51.900
Good luck. Behave yourself.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.500
Hi.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.100
Hi.

10:00.135 --> 10:01.700
Well, hello.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.900
- I heard about that.
- You heard about what?

10:05.935 --> 10:08.300
I heard about the skating.

10:08.335 --> 10:11.400
Oh. Yeah. Had to hang 'em up.

10:11.435 --> 10:12.500
That's what I heard.

10:12.535 --> 10:14.200
Anne, have a seat.

10:14.235 --> 10:16.200
Did you bring a ??é?

10:16.235 --> 10:17.900
Oh, not really.

10:17.935 --> 10:19.900
There's really nothing
in my background

10:19.935 --> 10:22.700
that gives me the credentials
to green up your firm he ??

10:22.735 --> 10:27.800
however, I did do some research on some
locally-made green products and services.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.400
Wow.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.900
- There's even a pie chart.
- Yeah.

10:32.935 --> 10:36.400
Well, this is great. Now I--
Now I don't even need you.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.200
That was a joke. I'm just trying
to make you comfortable.

10:40.235 --> 10:43.400
Oh, no, I'm comfortable.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.800
W-- Did you think I was
uncomfortable because...?

10:45.835 --> 10:47.500
Because...?

10:49.300 --> 10:51.600
You know my 15-year-old daughter
is pregnant, right?

10:51.635 --> 10:53.900
- No, I-I didn't.
- She is.

10:53.935 --> 10:57.300
And we almost let a gay couple
adopt the baby.

10:57.335 --> 10:58.200
Two guys.

10:58.235 --> 10:59.700
But then you found out
they were gay?

10:59.735 --> 11:03.000
No, no, I love them.
And they are very green.

11:03.035 --> 11:06.600
They're into recycling,repurposing,
they love antiques.

11:06.635 --> 11:09.200
They renovated an entire house
from top to bottom.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.100
They were the ones
who backed out.

11:11.135 --> 11:13.200
Of the adoption.
We didn'???

11:13.235 --> 11:15.100
- Because they were gay.
- Right.

11:15.135 --> 11:17.700
No. I mean, that didn't make
any difference to us.

11:17.735 --> 11:21.200
To my daughter, to myself,
or even my husband.

11:21.235 --> 11:24.000
Because we don't care
if someone's gay.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.700
We don't care if someone is gay.

11:27.735 --> 11:31.800
???
and illegal area for a job interview.

11:31.835 --> 11:34.800
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to say

11:34.835 --> 11:38.700
gays are here, they're queer,
I'm cool with it.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.300
Well, thanks for this.

11:40.335 --> 11:42.100
Thanks for this research.
This is great.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.500
Um, I'll give you a call
and let you know.

11:45.535 --> 11:47.100
Thank you.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.200
And whether or not you hire me,

11:49.235 --> 11:52.300
I reallythat the research
helps you out in some way.

11:52.335 --> 11:54.800
Thank you for your time.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.400
This is George's furniture store,

12:14.435 --> 12:16.400
but thisbus Donovan speaking,
how may I help you?

12:16.435 --> 12:18.200
You can't help me.
Is my dad there?

12:18.235 --> 12:19.500
Oh, Amy, how are you?

12:19.535 --> 12:23.600
- Is my dad there?
- He has a meeting this afternoon.

12:23.635 --> 12:26.200
- All right, thanks.
- Wait, w-wait. Are you okay?

12:26.235 --> 12:27.600
Do you need something?

12:27.635 --> 12:30.900
- Yeah, a home for my baby.
- I'm sure you'll find a home, Amy.

12:30.935 --> 12:33.000
I did find one.
The couple backed out.

12:33.035 --> 12:37.000
For an entire family of children who were
in foster care and desperately need a home.

12:37.035 --> 12:38.600
I'm pretty desperate too.

12:38.635 --> 12:40.500
Amy...

12:40.535 --> 12:44.000
There's a couple out there just dreaming
of becoming parents to your baby.

12:44.035 --> 12:45.300
I'm sure you'll find them

12:45.335 --> 12:47.200
- And if I don't?
- You will.

12:47.235 --> 12:48.500
Yeah. Bye.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.400
Do you want me to try to find
your dad for you?

12:50.435 --> 12:53.800
No, that's okay.
I can take care of myself.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.700
I just need a ride home
from school.

12:55.735 --> 12:57.200
I'll close and come pick you up.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.400
No, there are plenty of people
that can give me a ride.

13:00.435 --> 13:02.200
It's okay.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.500
It's so unfair that they
don't make these seats

13:06.535 --> 13:09.000
a little bigger
so we could share.

13:09.035 --> 13:11.400
I don't think it's that unfair.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.600
I told you,
I have boundary issues.

13:14.635 --> 13:16.600
I'm just trying to sneak
across the border.

13:16.635 --> 13:18.500
Just stay over there.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.700
- Hey, Amy.
- Amy?

13:22.735 --> 13:25.700
I hate to ask,but my dad must have
forgotten to pick me up from school.

13:25.735 --> 13:27.600
Do you think Jason
could give me a ride home?

13:27.635 --> 13:31.600
Of course.We need to pick up Amy.
She's stuck at school.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.700
-Are you okay?
- Yeah, uh,
can I get a ride or not?

13:36.735 --> 13:40.200
Of course. Um, yeah,
w-we'll pick you up.

13:40.235 --> 13:42.300
But you're gonna hang out
with us for once.

13:42.335 --> 13:45.200
No, I do not want to be
a fourth wheel.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.300
Hey, do you want us
to bring you a milkshake?

13:47.335 --> 13:50.800
We're at the Dairy Shack.The school
gets money for every shake they sell today.

13:50.835 --> 13:53.600
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to
be careful about what I eat.

13:53.635 --> 13:56.000
I don't want to gain too much weight,
but thanks.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.200
She's worried about her weight.

13:58.235 --> 14:00.100
You can have a shake.

14:00.135 --> 14:02.300
We're gonna pick you up a shake,
then we're gonna go to the mall.

14:02.335 --> 14:04.400
There's a two-for-one sale
at the Jean Barn.

14:04.435 --> 14:07.400
Oh, well, maybe you could
drop me off at home first.

14:07.435 --> 14:09.638
No, you have to go with us.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.600
You have to go with us, Amy.

14:12.635 --> 14:14.900
We can stop by tto Baby Bees
store if you want.

14:14.935 --> 14:17.100
Lauren, I'm not buying
clothes for the baby

14:17.135 --> 14:19.200
since the baby
is going to be adopted.

14:19.235 --> 14:22.300
Sorry, Amy. I-I wasn't thinking.

14:22.335 --> 14:24.300
But we want you to hang--

14:24.335 --> 14:26.900
Oh, Lauren, there's my dad.
He's here.

14:26.935 --> 14:29.500
Um, thank you for offering,
but I'm okay now.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.600
See you guys tomorrow.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.000
Her dad showed up.

14:34.035 --> 14:36.400
- She seemed kind of down.
- Kind of down?

14:36.435 --> 14:37.900
Don't you think
she'd be kind of down?

14:37.935 --> 14:40.600
She's having a baby
whole life is about to change.

14:40.635 --> 14:42.300
Well, not if she doesn't
keep the baby.

14:42.335 --> 14:43.800
When will she get over that?

14:43.835 --> 14:45.900
She's doing the right thing, Jason.

14:45.935 --> 14:48.200
Yeah, she probably is,

14:48.235 --> 14:51.300
but it's not the easiest thing.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.700
So he's my brother,
I don't care.

14:56.735 --> 14:57.900
He's so cute.

14:57.935 --> 15:00.300
- Hey, Amy,how are you?
- I'm okay.

15:00.335 --> 15:04.100
- What are you doing here so late?
-???

15:04.135 --> 15:07.100
We were just going to the Dairy Shack,
but I left my notebook here.

15:07.135 --> 15:09.600
Hey, I have an idea. You want to
go to the Dairy Shack with us?

15:09.635 --> 15:11.300
Oh, no, that's okay.

15:11.335 --> 15:13.600
Lauren and Madison
just asked me to go with them.

15:13.635 --> 15:16.000
So are you going with them?

15:16.035 --> 15:17.700
No, I'm just gonna go home.

15:17.735 --> 15:20.600
My dad's just running
a little late.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.000
Do you need Adrian
to drop you off at home?

15:26.035 --> 15:27.200
Do you?

15:27.235 --> 15:30.200
No, really. He's on his way.

15:30.235 --> 15:33.300
I better get out there.
I don't wanna miss him. Heh!

15:33.335 --> 15:37.900
But I'm just gonna walk
down the hall first.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.300
I feel so bad for her.

15:42.335 --> 15:44.600
She always looks so sad.

15:44.635 --> 15:47.500
Yeah, well, giving up
a baby can't be easy,

15:47.535 --> 15:49.500
but it's the best thing to do.

15:49.535 --> 15:51.700
Yeah, I guess.

15:51.735 --> 15:53.700
I just wish there was another
way for her to keep the baby.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.100
If that's what she wants to do.

15:55.135 --> 15:57.200
- Well, she can't.
- She could.

15:57.235 --> 15:59.600
No, she couldn't.
She can't take care of him.

15:59.635 --> 16:01.800
Your mom took care of you.
She was a single mom.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.900
-She was older than Amy.
- Well, not much older.

16:03.935 --> 16:05.900
- She had a job.
- Amy could get a job.

16:05.935 --> 16:09.300
She has a job. She has a job
at that hot dog place.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.600
Well, she needs another job.

16:10.635 --> 16:11.900
We can't get her a job.

16:11.935 --> 16:14.100
We could.
Anything is possible.

16:14.135 --> 16:16.000
Okay. Think about it.

16:16.035 --> 16:20.200
You really want Amy
to keep Ricky's baby?

16:20.900 --> 16:24.500
All right, you're in charge of
getting out the orders to be shipped.

16:24.535 --> 16:27.600
????at close of business.

16:27.635 --> 16:29.200
He has a refrigerated truck,

16:29.235 --> 16:32.400
he takes it straight to the airport
ernight shipping.

16:32.435 --> 16:36.900
All you gotta do is pack
each basket correctly.

16:36.935 --> 16:38.700
We got two kinds of orders.

16:38.735 --> 16:41.900
We got custom orders,
we got gift baskets.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.600
This is the chart
for the gift basket.

16:44.635 --> 16:46.700
Each gift basket you pack

16:46.735 --> 16:50.100
has to look exactly
like the picture.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.500
This is what people see
when they place the order.

16:52.535 --> 16:55.700
This is what we want them to see
when they get the order.

16:55.735 --> 16:58.300
But this is not the challenge.

16:58.335 --> 17:00.700
The challenge is the custom order.

17:00.735 --> 17:04.400
Each custom order has to be
as ordered.

17:04.435 --> 17:06.700
A box of steaks costs more
than you'll make this month.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.400
So make sure it's right.

17:08.435 --> 17:10.900
Make sure it's right,
and make sure it looks good.

17:10.935 --> 17:13.099
Oh, I-I'm sorry. I have--

17:13.135 --> 17:15.900
- I have a phone call.
- No, you don't.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.400
No cell phones at work.
That's the rule.

17:18.435 --> 17:20.400
But his girlfriend is expecting.

17:20.435 --> 17:23.300
Well, she'll still be expecting
when you get off from work.

17:23.335 --> 17:26.400
And no texting.
And no surfing the web.

17:26.435 --> 17:29.200
Pay attention to what
This isn't just a job,

17:29.235 --> 17:31.700
it's a dangerous job.

17:31.735 --> 17:33.500
You could lose a hand.

17:33.535 --> 17:36.000
I hope not.
???

17:36.035 --> 17:38.900
But if you do, and it's because
you were on your cell phone,

17:38.935 --> 17:41.100
don't come crying to me
to put it on a block of ice

17:41.135 --> 17:44.000
while you call 911.

17:44.035 --> 17:48.300
And don't make any mistakes.
You work for me,

17:48.335 --> 17:50.100
I work for your father.

17:50.135 --> 17:52.500
Don't go to your father
for any problems at work,

17:52.535 --> 17:55.600
you come to me.
And that goes for you ???

17:55.635 --> 17:58.000
Answer me
when I tell you something

17:58.035 --> 18:00.900
so I have some indication
you heard what I said.

18:00.935 --> 18:04.900
And by answer me, I mean
"Yes, ma'am" or "No, ma'am"

18:04.935 --> 18:06.900
or "I didn't understand, ma'am."
You got it?

18:06.935 --> 18:08.400
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.500
All right,
let's get going,

18:11.535 --> 18:15.000
we've wasted a lot of time.
Here's today's orders.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.900
Now! Go!

18:22.300 --> 18:24.100
So good to get my truck back.

18:24.135 --> 18:26.100
Somebody just left it
in front of the house.

18:26.135 --> 18:27.600
I hope they catch that someone.

18:27.635 --> 18:29.800
- They?
-The police.

18:29.835 --> 18:32.200
Why would they catch anyone
if you got the truck back?

18:32.235 --> 18:34.900
- I still wanna knowwho took my truck.
- I know who took your truck.

18:34.935 --> 18:37.100
Great. Let's call the police.
I wanna get the guy arrested.

18:37.135 --> 18:40.100
You threw down the keys
in front of the truck.

18:40.135 --> 18:41.800
You can't have a guy arrested.

18:41.835 --> 18:44.100
- Technically, it'd be entrapment.
- No, it's not.

18:44.135 --> 18:47.300
You had any experience
with crime before this?

18:47.335 --> 18:48.500
No. Just television.

18:48.535 --> 18:50.800
Maybe that's where the guy
got the idea to steal the truck.

18:50.835 --> 18:54.100
Television. You got all these guys
in the neighborhood,

18:54.135 --> 18:57.700
can't find a job,
nothing to do but watch television.

18:57.735 --> 18:59.200
And you tempt them

18:59.235 --> 19:01.700
by putting your keys
to your unlocked truck

19:01.735 --> 19:03.200
right there on the ground
in front of it.

19:03.235 --> 19:05.200
- That's not cool, man.
-I didn't put them there,

19:05.235 --> 19:07.500
I threw them there,
'cause I wanted to catch the mugger

19:07.535 --> 19:10.000
and get your money back
for the Disadvantaged Youth.

19:10.035 --> 19:13.500
How crazy are you to go chasing after
a criminal in a high crime area?

19:13.535 --> 19:17.000
I may be crazy, but I'm dedicated
to helping out Disadvantaged Youth.

19:17.035 --> 19:20.000
And most of all,
I made a promise to you

19:20.035 --> 19:22.200
to sell those candy bars.
All of them.

19:22.235 --> 19:24.500
And that was your money.

19:24.535 --> 19:26.400
I may have worked for days
to get you that money,

19:26.435 --> 19:28.500
but that was your money.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.700
- I didn't wanna let you down.
-Well, you did.

19:30.735 --> 19:32.700
??? That's why I'm trying
to keep the police involved

19:32.735 --> 19:36.000
- until we get the money back.
- What'd the guy look like?

19:36.900 --> 19:39.700
He was kind of tall,
he was black.

19:39.735 --> 19:41.900
Are you sure? Are you sure
you're not profiling?

19:41.935 --> 19:43.000
I'm not profiling.

19:43.035 --> 19:44.700
No, 'cause you said "tall,"

19:44.735 --> 19:47.000
and then you went
straight to "black."

19:47.035 --> 19:49.500
I mean, sounds like profiling.
Was he good at basketball?

19:49.535 --> 19:52.300
- You know I'm not like that.
- How do I know you're not like that?

19:52.335 --> 19:53.700
'Cause I'm in love with your sister.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.100
Well, not being prejudiced
against black women

19:56.135 --> 19:59.000
and not being prejudiced against
black men, two different things.

19:59.035 --> 20:01.800
- I'm in love with your sister.
- Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.

20:01.835 --> 20:03.800
I think you're the one
that's prejudiced.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.700
I'm colorblind.
I don't even see color.

20:05.735 --> 20:08.000
You just said the guy was black.

20:08.035 --> 20:10.100
- Oh, yeah.
- "Oh, yeah."

20:10.135 --> 20:12.300
All right,
let's quit playing games here.

20:12.335 --> 20:14.500
You were the guy.
You mugged me,

20:14.535 --> 20:17.300
you took the money, you hit me
in the head with a box.

20:17.335 --> 20:19.100
I'm glad you finally admitted it.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.200
I was beginning
to think you were stupid.

20:21.235 --> 20:22.300
I am stupid.

20:22.335 --> 20:25.700
I'm stupid enough to think that
I could be a good influence on you.

20:26.900 --> 20:30.400
"Stupid enough to think I could
be a good influence on you."

20:34.000 --> 20:35.300
These are candy bars.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.200
And the money really goes
to Disadvantaged Youth,

20:37.235 --> 20:39.300
a reputable organization
that sells candy bars

20:39.335 --> 20:41.600
that were donated to them
for a dollar a bar.

20:41.635 --> 20:44.400
We're going housto house
selling candy bars this afternoon.

20:44.435 --> 20:46.600
Don't you have a sense of humor?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.800
Look, you got the truck back.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.600
Ha, ha, ha! I don't believe it.
The loan went through.

20:53.635 --> 20:54.900
The house is mine.

20:54.935 --> 20:57.200
- Thank God for foreclosures, huh?
- It wasn't in foreclosure yet,

20:57.235 --> 21:00.000
that's why I got such a good deal.
I love good deals.

21:00.035 --> 21:02.400
Be kind, George.
You know those people.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.800
Never liked them, but basically
I just saved their butts.

21:04.835 --> 21:06.300
They were throwing their money away,

21:06.335 --> 21:07.800
going back to college at their age.

21:07.835 --> 21:10.400
Those two nincompoops were
never gonna finish college.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.700
D-did Amy call you?

21:12.735 --> 21:14.500
Amy? No.

21:14.535 --> 21:15.900
Were you supposed to pick her up
after school?

21:15.935 --> 21:18.200
She called over here
looking for you.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.800
Oh, jeez, I think Anne did say
to pick up the girls.

21:20.835 --> 21:22.500
Did Ashley call?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.600
- Ashley?
- Please tell me you picked up Amy.

21:27.635 --> 21:29.400
-???
-?

21:29.435 --> 21:31.500
-Why didn't you remind me?
- I don't know.

21:31.535 --> 21:33.700
So you don't know where she is
or if she's upset?

21:33.735 --> 21:35.900
She's almost eight months pregnant,
she's always upset.

21:35.935 --> 21:37.700
Plus, she's probably annoyed
that I talked

21:37.735 --> 21:40.000
non-stop about the baby
the entire way to school.

21:40.035 --> 21:41.700
I got hung up at the bank.

21:41.735 --> 21:44.000
- They still have banks?
- Of course they still have banks.

21:44.035 --> 21:46.000
I didn't know. I thought
they just had those machines.

21:46.035 --> 21:48.600
You can't get a loan for a house
at those machines.

21:48.635 --> 21:51.000
Does Ashley know about that?

21:58.700 --> 22:00.900
- Hey, it's me, Dad.
- Who?

22:00.935 --> 22:05.300
- Did you get a ride home?
- Not exactly. I'm just out with friends.

22:05.335 --> 22:06.600
Want me to come and get you?

22:06.635 --> 22:08.300
- No.
- I'm so sorry, Ames.

22:08.335 --> 22:10.700
I was driving down Bleeker Street,
and the brakes went out,

22:10.735 --> 22:12.600
and I had to steer my car to a stop,

22:12.635 --> 22:13.900
and, uh,
I almost hit a deer.

22:13.935 --> 22:15.500
Really? That's like
the third time this month

22:15.535 --> 22:18.200
when you've been late for
something that you said that.

22:18.235 --> 22:20.400
They really have to do something
about this deer problem.

22:20.435 --> 22:22.600
So you call me
if you need a riokay, honey?

22:22.635 --> 22:25.000
Yeah, okay. Bye.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.300
Okay,I'll take care of it.
Thanks.

22:42.100 --> 22:45.000
I am so sorry. There was
a problem with an order

22:45.035 --> 22:48.400
that I had to straighten out
or I would've been stuck with 300 onesies.

22:48.435 --> 22:51.900
- Can I help yousomething?
- Well--

22:52.600 --> 22:54.700
Actually, can't say
I need any onesies.

22:54.735 --> 22:56.800
I have lots of those.
From my baby shower.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.200
Very popular gift.

22:58.235 --> 23:01.200
If it's a brand we carry, and if
they're still in the package,

23:01.235 --> 23:02.800
I'd be glad to exchange
them for you.

23:02.835 --> 23:04.500
If I thought I could
find them in my minivan,

23:04.535 --> 23:07.300
I'd go out and get them.
Thing is piled high with stuff--

23:07.335 --> 23:10.900
The high chair, the bassinet,
the car seat-- It's a mess.

23:10.935 --> 23:13.000
And yet I see
you're still shopping.

23:13.035 --> 23:15.900
- Must be your first.
- Yeah. Heh.

23:15.935 --> 23:20.000
- You look so young.
- Oh, uh, thank you. I'm-- I'm 21.

23:20.035 --> 23:24.000
I-- Just one semester short of
finishing college when I got pregnant.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.300
All that late-night studying,

23:25.335 --> 23:28.500
I got a little distracted
one night and there you go.

23:28.535 --> 23:30.700
It's a boy? You look like
you're carrying a boy.

23:30.735 --> 23:33.200
I am. He should be here
in about four weeks.

23:33.235 --> 23:35.100
Ohh. Boys.

23:35.135 --> 23:38.500
I've got two boys, twins,
Jeffrey and David.

23:38.535 --> 23:40.000
That's nice.

23:40.035 --> 23:42.000
So, what are you gonna name him?
We're not sure yet.

23:42.035 --> 23:44.100
My husband wants us
to see him first, then decide.

23:44.135 --> 23:45.400
Oh, that's what we dLY.

23:45.435 --> 23:47.200
And when we first saw
the babies, we knew exactly

23:47.235 --> 23:49.100
which one was Jeffrey
and which one was David.

23:49.135 --> 23:52.400
- It's so funny how that happens.
- Yeah.

23:52.435 --> 23:55.200
I can't wait to see his face.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.200
This is a gift.

23:57.235 --> 24:00.000
Now, I know you have everything,
but it is your first,

24:00.035 --> 24:02.200
and these truly are the best
little overalls.

24:02.235 --> 24:05.200
You've got to have them.
From me to you.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.500
I couldn't let you do that.

24:06.535 --> 24:08.300
No. I want to.

24:08.335 --> 24:10.800
And I wanna see him in these.

24:10.835 --> 24:14.400
Promise me you'll bring him
back here so I can meet him.

24:14.435 --> 24:16.300
Okay...

24:16.335 --> 24:19.700
Uh, but really,
m-my baby has so much already.

24:19.735 --> 24:21.500
Maybe you should give those
to a baby in need.

24:21.535 --> 24:24.700
We do plenty to take care
of babies in need.

24:24.735 --> 24:27.100
When he outgrows these,
justring 'em back,

24:27.135 --> 24:29.000
we'll put 'em
in the giveaway basket.

24:29.035 --> 24:32.700
- Oh, well,that's very nice of you.
- I didn't get your name.

24:32.735 --> 24:36.100
Oh. Uh, it's...
It's Lauren Madison.

24:36.135 --> 24:38.200
Oh. Good luck, Lauren Madison.

24:38.235 --> 24:40.400
Thank you.

24:42.700 --> 24:45.000
Dude,you finally found your sport.

24:45.035 --> 24:46.900
I'm just trying to make it look
like the picture.

24:46.935 --> 24:49.300
Yeah, all right.
Well, you better get moving.

24:49.335 --> 24:50.700
- Excuse me?
- You heard Bunny.

24:50.735 --> 24:52.500
We have to get all these orders
out by end of day.

24:52.535 --> 24:55.800
It's a half-hour from end of
day, you've made three baskets.

24:55.835 --> 24:58.000
Yeah, but my baskets look good.

24:58.035 --> 24:59.300
Yours on the other hand...

24:59.335 --> 25:01.000
Mine on the other hand
are just as good,

25:01.035 --> 25:02.600
and I'd never curled ribbon before.

25:02.635 --> 25:05.900
Hey, girls, quit gossiping
and get back to work.

25:05.935 --> 25:08.000
Where's my cow?

25:11.700 --> 25:13.100
Here you go.

25:13.135 --> 25:14.600
You wanna learn to slice tMI?

25:14.635 --> 25:17.100
Yeah. I mean, yes, ma'am.

25:17.135 --> 25:20.200
- Excuse me.
- Uh, maybe I'd like a lesson in slicing beef too.

25:20.235 --> 25:22.700
You would, would you?
Did you finish your baskets?

25:22.735 --> 25:24.400
Um, no. Uh, no, ma'am.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.700
But the baskets I did finish
are perfect.

25:26.735 --> 25:29.100
Quantity and quality, Ben.

25:29.135 --> 25:31.400
Get back in there.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.300
I really appreciate this opportunity.
I'm just so happy to have a job.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.500
Is this your first job?

25:37.535 --> 25:38.800
Yeah, it's my first job.

25:38.835 --> 25:41.000
I started here
when I was about your age.

25:41.035 --> 25:42.600
Brought in my own cow.

25:42.635 --> 25:45.000
4-H project.

25:45.100 --> 25:46.800
about 20 years ago.

25:46.835 --> 25:48.700
So you never
got promoted upstairs?

25:48.735 --> 25:51.900
This is as high up
as yan go here. Manager.

25:52.100 --> 25:53.700
But it's a good job.

25:53.735 --> 25:56.100
You work hard, you'll do okay.

butcher's license yet?

26:21.235 --> 26:23.300
That can wait.
Let me help you with that.

26:23.335 --> 26:25.900
Help me? Maybe you should

26:29.135 --> 26:31.300
Behat information's
on the back of the order.

26:31.335 --> 26:34.100
You just turn it over and it
becomes the mailing label.

26:34.135 --> 26:37.500
And the order has already been charged,
that's why we're fillire the order.

26:37.535 --> 26:40.600
??? filling orders
if someone hadn't paid for 'em?

26:40.635 --> 26:44.000
I take back what I said.
About getting everyone on my side.

26:44.035 --> 26:48.600
????

26:48.635 --> 26:51.500
Please, don't do that wh
fake sinfarity thing with me.

26:51.535 --> 26:55.700
- I see right through it.
- I want AI to keep the baby.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.800
Hi. I'm back.

27:00.835 --> 27:04.200
Hi, assistant person.
I let myself in. Obviously.

27:04.235 --> 27:06.000
Should I call security?

27:06.035 --> 27:07.700
I'll let you know.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.000
Did you forget something?

27:12.035 --> 27:15.300
You, uh, wanna speak out
for animal rights this time?

27:15.335 --> 27:17.400
Well, I am passionate
about saving animals,

27:17.435 --> 27:19.700
but I don't have any animals myself,

27:19.735 --> 27:22.500
so I think that would
seem hypocritical,

27:22.535 --> 27:24.700
whereas I do have gay friends.

27:24.735 --> 27:27.300
Although, come to think of it,
they have animals.

27:27.335 --> 27:30.800
- Cats, dogs, everything.
- Do they?

27:30.835 --> 27:33.800
Anyway, I don't think
I'm comfortable speaking up

27:33.835 --> 27:35.900
for animal rights
until I quit eating meat,

27:35.935 --> 27:39.300
???

27:39.335 --> 27:42.800
??????

27:42.835 --> 27:47.700
???I veeen reading something
when clearly there was nothing to read into.

27:47.735 --> 27:51.300
So I came here,
and sort of tried

27:51.335 --> 27:53.300
to over-compensate
for flirting with you

27:53.335 --> 27:55.800
by overstating
my admiration for gay men.

27:55.835 --> 27:58.100
So, what are you saying,
you don't really like gay men?

27:58.135 --> 28:00.500
I love them. I-I do. I--

28:00.535 --> 28:03.800
I just don't love them any more
than any other

28:03.835 --> 28:06.800
specific group of people
in the world.

28:06.835 --> 28:09.300
I love everyone. Equally.

28:09.335 --> 28:10.900
- Everyone?
- Pretty much.

28:10.935 --> 28:15.500
Let's rewind to "There was nothing to
read into my flirting with you."

28:15.535 --> 28:19.100
- I was flirting with you.
- I thought you were.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.200
- But why would you do that?
- Why wouldn't I do that?

28:22.235 --> 28:24.600
Because you're gay?

28:24.635 --> 28:27.100
- What?
- Gay.

28:27.135 --> 28:29.100
???

28:29.135 --> 28:32.600
I'm sorry, I-I forgot about
your, um, hearing problem.

28:32.635 --> 28:35.000
Uh, challenge. Impairment.

28:35.035 --> 28:39.100
I am deeply heterosexual,
and unfortunately,

28:39.135 --> 28:42.900
I can hear every word
you've said.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.900
Hi. I'm Anne Juergens.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.700
David Johnson. Nice to meet you.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.600
Hockey skates.

29:11.800 --> 29:16.000
Now th we've got that cleared up,
let's take a look at this research.

29:16.035 --> 29:18.600
- Okay.
- Don't ever let that happen again.

29:18.635 --> 29:20.800
Let what happen?

29:22.300 --> 29:24.200
My dad loves you,

29:24.235 --> 29:27.000
and my sister loves you, and--

29:27.035 --> 29:28.400
Have you ever seen this before?

29:28.435 --> 29:30.300
No, I took it out
of her jewelry box.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.600
- Well, who made it?
- Who else? Ben.

29:32.635 --> 29:33.700
Where were we?

29:33.735 --> 29:37.000
???I got the job as a wait
so I could help her keep the baby.

29:37.035 --> 29:38.500
I feel left out
of the whole thing.

29:38.535 --> 29:42.300
??too. You know, this is just
her and Mom conspiring to adopt.

29:42.335 --> 29:46.600
Yeah, well, it's me and you conspiring
to not adopt, so we can't say anything.

29:46.900 --> 29:51.500
--and, uh, I'm gonna do whatever I have to do
to make sure that happens for you,

29:51.535 --> 29:54.300
to make sure that you get
all that life has to offer

29:54.335 --> 29:56.100
'cause that's what my parents
did for me,

29:56.135 --> 30:01.000
and because you're my son.

30:01.035 --> 30:03.900
You think the baby's gonna
buy that when he's 18?

30:03.935 --> 30:06.800
"I love you so much,
but I gave you away

30:06.835 --> 30:09.900
"because I didn't wanna miss
prom or homecoming

30:09.935 --> 30:12.100
"or high school graduation

30:12.135 --> 30:15.500
"or all of those fun times
hanging with my two BFFs.

30:15.535 --> 30:18.500
"And besides, I met a rich guy
after I got pregnant,

30:18.535 --> 30:20.900
"and I think he really
really likes me,

30:20.935 --> 30:24.100
and just I didn't want you
to mess that up, little baby."

30:24.135 --> 30:27.200
Ash, come on, you know
she's struggling with this.

30:27.235 --> 30:28.800
This isn't easy for Amy.

30:28.835 --> 30:30.800
No, it isn't.

30:41.700 --> 30:44.500
We blew it. Now she's not gonna
listen to us. She hates us.

30:44.535 --> 30:46.100
She shouldn't have snuck up like that.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.400
Ashley, it's her house too.

30:47.435 --> 30:49.200
And it's the only safe place
she's got right now.

30:49.235 --> 30:52.100
It's Amy's sanctuary where she
gets away from the world.

30:52.135 --> 30:53.701
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame?

30:52.135 --> 30:53.701
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame?

30:53.736 --> 30:56.100
Ashley, I'm serious here. I want
you to go fix this with Amy.

30:56.135 --> 30:59.200
Your mom's gonna be home any minute with
a list of couples, and we're in trouble.

30:59.235 --> 31:04.000
- Then why don't we go fix it?
- You stole the DVD,and you made the big speech.

31:04.200 --> 31:07.800
Oh, jeez, it's your mom.
Amy probably called her. Go now.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.800
- Hey.
- It's me, George.

31:10.835 --> 31:13.200
I guess I'm just gonna head
straight to the stand.

31:13.235 --> 31:16.100
- I didn't get the job.
- What? But gay men love you.

31:16.135 --> 31:19.700
He's not gay, George.
David Johnson is not gay.

31:19.735 --> 31:22.200
Johnson? You mean Jackson.
David Jackson, right?

31:22.235 --> 31:24.100
No. Johnson.

31:24.135 --> 31:28.200
Oh. That must be the problem. That Donovan.
I hope I didn't throw you off.

31:28.235 --> 31:29.500
Oh, of course not.

31:29.535 --> 31:34.200
I'm sure it had nothingnoth do with
that I was screaverything,thind the guy'???

31:34.235 --> 31:37.400
Oh, I feel just terriblete
Is there anything I can do?

31:37.435 --> 31:39.500
I could swing by the weenie stand,
pick up your suit,

31:39.535 --> 31:41.600
get it to the cleaners so you
can have it back by morning.

31:41.635 --> 31:43.000
That's so nice of you.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.900
Why are you being so nice to me?

31:44.935 --> 31:47.400
'Cause I didn't get the job,
or there's something else going on?

31:47.435 --> 31:50.300
Well, I know it must have been
a terrible day for you.

31:50.335 --> 31:52.300
How'd you make out with
the interviews, the couples?

31:52.335 --> 31:54.100
That part of the day
went pretty well.

31:54.135 --> 31:55.800
But I'm gonna let Amy decide.

31:55.835 --> 31:56.900
Don't say anything.
Don't say anything.

31:56.935 --> 31:59.500
Amy already spoke to her.
I have to get back.

31:59.535 --> 32:04.300
Oh, and Mom thinks she got the job.
She's still with that guy, the architect.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.500
Is there something going on?

32:07.535 --> 32:09.900
I wasn't going to say anything,
but...

32:09.935 --> 32:12.200
I was at the doctor's,
and I missed picking the girls up.

32:12.235 --> 32:14.200
Ashley took the bus. And Amy--
Well, I called her,

32:14.235 --> 32:16.100
she said she was gonna get a ride,

32:16.135 --> 32:18.300
but then she took the bus too.

32:18.335 --> 32:20.900
And now they're both in horrible moods,
they got into a fight,things were said.

32:20.935 --> 32:23.700
You go on down to the weenie stand,
I'll bring them by???,

32:23.735 --> 32:25.800
you can take care of them,
'cause you're bett'r at this stuff,

32:25.835 --> 32:28.600
you mared in this stuff,
women's studies. Yeah.

32:28.635 --> 32:31.800
- Here's the time to put that to good use.
- I don't think Amy feels like working tonight.

32:31.835 --> 32:33.300
I'm just gonna go by myself.

32:33.335 --> 32:35.600
Ashley and I will go by
an organic produce stand

32:35.635 --> 32:37.600
and bring her something.
I want you to speak to Ashley.

32:37.635 --> 32:39.500
- About?
- Aboubecer to Amy.

32:39.535 --> 32:41.500
Why can't yok her?

32:41.535 --> 32:43.400
And, anyway, why were you
at the doctor's?

32:43.435 --> 32:45.000
You haven't been
to the doctor's in years.

32:45.035 --> 32:47.700
This isn't the time to talk about it.
We'll talk face to face.

32:47.735 --> 32:48.800
George, what is it?

32:48.835 --> 32:50.800
I need you to be strong here.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.100
I know there's a lot going on,
you don't need anything else to worry about,

32:53.135 --> 32:55.700
- so promise you wse???
- About the girl????

32:55.735 --> 32:57.100
The girls are young, healthy.

32:57.135 --> 32:58.900
Spit it out.
What's wrong with you?

32:58.935 --> 33:00.800
It's the...

33:00.835 --> 33:02.900
- petula.
-The what?

33:02.935 --> 33:04.900
But honestly, that's not
where the pain is coming from,

33:04.935 --> 33:06.700
it's coming from
not being included in the video

33:06.735 --> 33:09.900
when Amy finds out the sex
of the baby. I have to go.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.900
Jeez, she's turning into a man,
and I'm turning into a woman.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.000
- Get out.
- You can't tell me to get out of my own house.

33:27.035 --> 33:29.000
That's your mother's job. Heh!

33:29.035 --> 33:31.700
Don't look at her.
You two were in on this together,

33:31.735 --> 33:34.700
making fun of me
while I'm having a baby.

33:34.735 --> 33:36.500
How could you?
You're my father!

33:36.535 --> 33:38.400
Amy, you know me.

33:38.435 --> 33:40.100
You know your sister.
We mock people.

33:40.135 --> 33:42.600
We mock ourselves. You can't
take these things personally.

33:42.635 --> 33:45.100
- Well, I do.
- Come on, you know we love you.

33:45.135 --> 33:47.500
We were just upset we weren't
part of the video, that's all.

33:47.535 --> 33:50.500
No, that's not all.

33:50.800 --> 33:54.300
Do you really think
I don't care about my baby?

33:54.335 --> 33:57.800
No, you care too much,
yet not enough.

33:57.835 --> 34:00.200
- What does that mean?
- Something good, right, Ash?

34:00.235 --> 34:03.600
You care enough to take care
of the baby before he's born,

34:03.635 --> 34:05.700
but you don't care enough
to take care of him after that?

34:05.735 --> 34:08.199
I can't!
Someone else has to do that.

34:08.235 --> 34:10.000
Why can't you understand that?

34:10.034 --> 34:11.167
I can't understand it,

34:11.202 --> 34:13.600
and I don't think the baby'll
understand it when he grows up either.

34:13.635 --> 34:14.847
He will understand.

34:14.882 --> 34:18.400
He'll understand that I was only doing
what I thought was best for him.

34:18.435 --> 34:22.199
I mean, even if you and Mom and Dad
and Ricky and Ben

34:22.235 --> 34:24.699
and all of our family
and friends helped out,

34:24.735 --> 34:27.699
it's not possible
for me to be a mother,

34:27.735 --> 34:30.000
a real mother, at 15.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.900
- Says who?
- What?

34:31.935 --> 34:32.913
Suppose you could.

34:32.947 --> 34:36.100
Suppose you could be a real mother
at 15 and raise the baby yourself.

34:36.135 --> 34:37.699
Suppose we all helped you
raise the baby.

34:37.735 --> 34:41.500
???
and Ben and their families and their friends.

34:41.534 --> 34:45.100
This is not some weird
group project, Ashley.

34:45.135 --> 34:49.600
This is a human being,
and I am responsible for this human being.

34:49.635 --> 34:52.100
He's my son.
I have to do the right thing.

34:52.135 --> 34:53.400
I have to do what's best for him.

34:53.435 --> 34:57.700
- I have to find him a home.
- Think about yourself.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.400
Think about doing the best thing
for yourself.

34:59.435 --> 35:02.300
Maybe it's best for you
and your baby to stay together.

35:02.335 --> 35:06.400
I can't think about that,
because it's not.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.800
- It can't be.
- Why can't it?

35:08.835 --> 35:11.800
Why do you insist on believing that
this is a bad thing that happened?

35:11.835 --> 35:13.500
Because that's what other people think?

35:13.535 --> 35:16.200
Please listen to me, please.
I know you wanna be in the band,

35:16.235 --> 35:19.300
but it's not the band that's
important to you, it's music.

35:19.335 --> 35:22.900
You love music, and you can still play
your French ??when the baby comes.

35:22.935 --> 35:27.500
And I know school is important to you,
but really isn't it education that's important?

35:27.535 --> 35:29.600
You'll get the education
you want somehow, Amy.

35:29.635 --> 35:31.500
I know you will,
because you're smart.

35:31.535 --> 35:33.500
You've always been smart, so

35:33.535 --> 35:35.900
you'll figure out school.
You'll figure out a way.

35:35.935 --> 35:38.800
And you'll find some work,
???

35:38.835 --> 35:41.000
You can do this, Amy.
You really can.

35:41.035 --> 35:43.600
It's possible that this baby
is a good thing for all of us.

35:43.635 --> 35:47.400
It's possible that we all learn
how to live from this. And to be happy.

35:47.435 --> 35:51.200
Come on. So Mimsy has Alzheimer's,
Mom and Dad are getting a divorce,

35:51.235 --> 35:55.200
and the family is splitting up, and you got
pregnant the first time you had sex.

35:55.235 --> 35:58.400
So what? Maybe it's all good.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.300
And even if it isn't,
let's just say it is.

36:01.335 --> 36:03.700
When did you move away
from the dark side?

36:03.735 --> 36:06.400
As soon as I could.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.500
You could keep the baby,
if you want.

36:09.535 --> 36:12.300
I mean, I wasn't gonna
say anything, but...

36:12.335 --> 36:14.100
really?

36:26.800 --> 36:29.400
So you really did all this
just to get the job?

36:29.435 --> 36:32.200
Well, honestly, I figured
if I didn't get the job,

36:32.235 --> 36:34.700
I could just use the research
to get another job.

36:34.735 --> 36:38.100
Ah. I was just hoping
that this was just for me.

36:38.135 --> 36:40.900
Could be. How much are you
thinking about paying me?

36:40.935 --> 36:45.000
I see.You think you could get me drunk
and then ask me about the money?

36:45.035 --> 36:47.300
Yes. So...?

36:47.335 --> 36:52.200
Well, honestly,
we could probably pay you--

36:54.400 --> 36:56.200
Were you not gonna kiss me?

36:56.235 --> 36:58.200
I was gonna tell you how much
I was gonna pay you.

36:58.235 --> 36:59.500
Oh. Okay.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.700
- A year.
- Okay.

37:02.735 --> 37:04.800
Why are you saying okay?
Don't say okay to that.

37:04.835 --> 37:07.100
What, you're going to
pay me more? I'll take it.

37:07.135 --> 37:08.600
No, no, no.
What you wanna say is,

37:08.635 --> 37:11.100
"That would be fine as a consultant,
but for that money,

37:11.135 --> 37:13.500
I'd have to work for more
than one architectural firm."

37:13.535 --> 37:15.700
Well, I can't keep on
doing these interviews.

37:15.735 --> 37:18.100
- Why?
- You're so good at it.

37:18.135 --> 37:19.500
That's a joke, right?

37:19.535 --> 37:21.600
Ah, yeah.

37:21.635 --> 37:23.400
No, what I'm saying is,

37:23.435 --> 37:26.700
start a consultant business
where you go to other firms,

37:26.735 --> 37:29.000
other interior design firms

37:29.035 --> 37:32.100
or directly to clients
that just wanna green up.

37:32.135 --> 37:34.200
Oh l don't think I'm ready
to start my own business.

37:34.235 --> 37:37.100
I think not only are you ready
to start your own business,

37:37.135 --> 37:38.900
I think you're ready
to start your own life.

37:38.935 --> 37:40.800
Well, maybe tomorrow.

37:40.835 --> 37:43.900
But tonight I've got two teenage
daughters who are fighting

37:43.935 --> 37:46.200
and one soon-to-be ex-husband
who just got bad news

37:46.235 --> 37:47.900
from his doctor about his peET.

37:47.935 --> 37:49.700
I'm sorry, what is that?
His girliend?

37:49.735 --> 37:53.300
There's not a body part
called the petula, is there?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.100
And let the girls fight it out.

37:55.135 --> 37:58.400
They're gonn'rbe fighting
for years, a lifetime.

37:58.435 --> 38:00.900
Let's go grab dinner and talk.

38:00.935 --> 38:03.400
And don't take out
your cell phone.

38:03.435 --> 38:04.900
They can figure it out.

38:04.935 --> 38:07.600
Have dinner with a grownup.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.687
And by the way,

38:08.687 --> 38:12.300
I will never talk to you the way
 that your husband talks to you.

38:12.335 --> 38:14.400
You deserve better.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.000
What do you think?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.100
- People are here to see you.
- Who?

38:30.135 --> 38:32.500
stupid cheerleader.
Wife Number One's daughter.

38:32.535 --> 38:34.200
- Grace?
- You want me to send her away?

38:34.235 --> 38:37.300
No, I'm kind of curious
as to why she'd be here.

38:37.335 --> 38:40.600
- How'd she get here?
- Some guy is with her. Big guy.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.100
- Hi.
-Hi.

38:49.135 --> 38:50.300
Hello.

38:50.335 --> 38:52.200
You wanna sit down or something?

38:52.235 --> 38:55.200
- Um, could we?
- Yeah, sure.

39:01.600 --> 39:06.000
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Uh, yeah. Sure.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.500
What are you doing here?

39:11.535 --> 39:14.500
I don't know,
but what are you doing here?

39:14.535 --> 39:17.200
I saw you at the stoplight,
and I turned around.

39:17.235 --> 39:19.200
- Oh, hey, Amy.
- Hi.

39:19.235 --> 39:22.500
I don't know whaty're doing here.

39:25.500 --> 39:29.100
Hey,is there a party going on?

39:29.135 --> 39:31.500
- Hi, Ricky.
- Hi.

39:32.400 --> 39:35.000
I don't know what's going on.

39:35.035 --> 39:36.400
So are you dating him now?

39:36.435 --> 39:38.200
No, I have a girlfriend.
We're friends.

39:38.235 --> 39:39.300
Yeah, whatever.

39:39.335 --> 39:42.100
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

39:42.300 --> 39:45.000
Okay, someone tell me
why you're all here.

39:45.035 --> 39:47.500
I just wanted to ask you
if you'd be interested in a job.

39:47.535 --> 39:49.300
She doesn't need to get a job.

39:49.335 --> 39:50.500
Ricky and I got jobs.

39:50.535 --> 39:53.400
And, uh, we're gonna make
those jobs work, Amy.

39:53.435 --> 39:57.000
Promise. We just wanted you
to take that into consideration

39:57.035 --> 39:59.500
in case you were thinking
you'd like to keep the baby.

39:59.535 --> 40:02.600
Well, I would like to keep
the baby, but I just don't know.

40:02.635 --> 40:04.800
Oh, you know you wanna keep the baby.

40:04.835 --> 40:08.500
I mean, who wouldn't wanna
keep Ricky's baby?

40:09.500 --> 40:12.000
Uh, it's a complicated decision.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.600
Well, if it helps, Grace came up
with a really good idea,

40:14.635 --> 40:17.400
and she came to me,
and I went to my dad.

40:17.435 --> 40:19.900
And, uh, here's what the church
can offer you.

40:19.935 --> 40:22.300
A job.
A job in the daycare center.

40:22.335 --> 40:24.300
So you can leave the baby there
during school hours,

40:24.335 --> 40:27.600
then when you get out of school,you can work
to pay for the care that you receive.

40:27.635 --> 40:29.700
And if you would,
you could teach the kids music,

40:29.735 --> 40:31.400
and they'd pay you for that.

40:31.435 --> 40:33.400
And the church provides
insurance to all employees,

40:33.435 --> 40:35.600
??my dad thinks
it's ethically responsible.

40:35.635 --> 40:39.000
And we can all babysit for you,
if you need us to.

40:39.035 --> 40:42.700
We'll help you, if you want,
if you decide that you wanna keep the baby.

40:42.735 --> 40:44.600
Wait, and how am I helping out?
I forget.

40:44.635 --> 40:47.200
Oh, yeah. Um...

40:47.235 --> 40:50.400
Adrian volunteered to help us
throw a baby shower for you at her house.

40:50.435 --> 40:52.000
No!

40:52.035 --> 40:53.600
If she's gonna have
a baby shower,

40:53.635 --> 40:55.800
then we're gonna give her
a baby shower.

40:55.835 --> 40:59.100
Too late.
So...you're having a shower?

40:59.135 --> 41:00.300
You're keeping the baby?

41:00.335 --> 41:02.400
Figured if everyone was here,
we'd just...

41:02.435 --> 41:04.300
You'd just what?

41:04.800 --> 41:07.700
Hi. Lovely home.

41:07.735 --> 41:09.800
Are you keeping the baby?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.500
You're up late.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.500
You're out late.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.100
Did you have a great time?

41:31.135 --> 41:34.300
Yeah, I did have a great time.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.800
He's a very nice guy.

41:36.835 --> 41:38.900
And I'm really excited
about my new job.

41:38.935 --> 41:41.400
I'm so excited for you.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.100
- Mom--
- Amy.

41:45.400 --> 41:49.500
I know that you wanna
keep the baby. I could feel it.

41:49.535 --> 41:54.800
And while I don't know how I feel about you
taking on motherhood at 15 years old,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.400
I think that you could do it,

41:57.435 --> 42:00.400
if that's what you really wanted,

42:00.500 --> 42:02.500
and that's what I told
Reverend Stone today.

42:02.535 --> 42:06.300
I got a job.
A job with insurance and daycare.

42:06.335 --> 42:08.200
And-- And Ben got a job.
And Ricky got a job.

42:08.235 --> 42:11.000
And everyone wants to help,
Mom, everyone.

42:11.035 --> 42:14.800
I think I can do it, Mom,
will you let me do it,

42:14.835 --> 42:18.400
will you?
Will you let me keep the baby?

42:18.435 --> 42:21.300
I'll be a good mom,
I promise I will.

42:21.335 --> 42:25.500
Of course, Amy,
of course you can.

42:25.535 --> 42:28.600
And I will help you
as much as I can.

42:28.635 --> 42:32.500
But, Amy, this is going to be
your baby,

42:32.535 --> 42:34.800
and you have to take care of him.

42:34.835 --> 42:36.400
And it's not gonna be easy.

42:36.435 --> 42:40.100
Thank you. Thank you.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.100
I know that I can be a good mom

42:42.135 --> 42:46.300
because I'veot the best mom
in the whole world.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.100
She didn't mention you.
Or me.

42:51.135 --> 42:53.100
Par for the course.

42:53.135 --> 42:54.900
- We did it.
- We did it.
