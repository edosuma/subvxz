WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:05.046
Oenomaus:
Freedom?

00:05.214 --> 00:06.420
Batiatus: No longer shall
you be my Doctore.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.922
You will assume the mantle
of Lanista

00:09.092 --> 00:12.300
and be warmly greeted
by your name-- Oenomaus.

00:13.597 --> 00:16.088
- What is this madness?!
- Spartacus shows us the way.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.519
He sends word to me
that one of the fallen

00:19.686 --> 00:21.551
bore your name
carved into his chest.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.221
The consuls will present a motion
dispatching you to Capua.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.981
There are villas and farms
far from the city.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.313
Naevia was handed
from dominus to dominus.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.103
-(gags)
- Spartacus: We move south

00:31.281 --> 00:33.112
to find Naevia.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.363
( screams )

00:34.535 --> 00:36.241
This is Batiatus' wife?

00:36.411 --> 00:39.369
- A shadow of the same.
- And yet she lives.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.781
It would give the city hope
to see a woman

00:41.959 --> 00:43.449
survive Spartacus and his men.

00:45.921 --> 00:48.128
- ( screams )
- Where do you go?

00:48.298 --> 00:50.550
There is but one place

00:50.717 --> 00:53.208
for an animal without honor.

01:04.523 --> 01:06.514
( panting )

01:12.406 --> 01:14.021
( muted crowd booing )

01:17.119 --> 01:19.110
( crowd jeering )

01:29.673 --> 01:32.836
- Come on!
- Raah!

01:33.010 --> 01:34.500
(yelling)

02:19.264 --> 02:20.253
Go on!

02:28.815 --> 02:30.396
Yeah!

02:33.111 --> 02:34.191
Kill!

02:47.376 --> 02:48.456
- Yeah!
- Get up!

02:51.713 --> 02:54.090
Man:
Take his fucking face off! Yeah!

02:56.718 --> 02:58.504
-( laughing)
- Yeah!

03:30.502 --> 03:33.539
(yells)

03:35.257 --> 03:38.294
(screaming )

03:43.557 --> 03:44.763
Yeah!

03:46.351 --> 03:49.058
Yeah!

03:52.315 --> 03:53.771
(yelling)

04:04.161 --> 04:06.277
( cheering )

04:07.581 --> 04:09.663
Yeah!

04:23.388 --> 04:25.845
That is no boy,
but fucking demon

04:26.016 --> 04:29.099
belched from the cunt
of the underworld.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.640
Your presence in the Pits
comes as welcome surprise.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.185
When word that Titus Batiatus
graced us with his presence--

04:40.363 --> 04:41.352
Where did you find him?

04:41.531 --> 04:44.898
He's from a pack of Numidians
purchased from Maalok.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.158
The others fell
within the week.

04:47.329 --> 04:50.537
This one proves too dim
to sniff out their trail.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.163
- Has he any training?
- Training?

04:52.334 --> 04:54.370
A rabid dog would be
more agreeable pupil.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.126
Barely answers
to the name given him.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.128
All men can be tamed,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.836
no matter how wild.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.548
One must only find
an ember of purpose

05:05.722 --> 05:07.587
and give it breath.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.222
I give no shit to embers.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.134
Coin warms my breast.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.054
And the price
to see you so inflamed?

05:15.232 --> 05:18.065
10 denarii,
and the boy is yours

05:18.235 --> 05:20.146
to train, to fuck,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.402
whatever you would
have of him.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.028
Eight.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.030
Eight? You appear
as honorable man,

05:26.201 --> 05:28.487
yet attempt
to slip cock in ass.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.863
lfl held such desire...

05:34.334 --> 05:36.416
you would be split in two.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.046
I give you this bargain
only to entice further purchases.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.383
Rise.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.215
Greet your new master, Oenomaus.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.380
( crowd cheering nearby )

06:00.861 --> 06:02.522
It is time.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.152
Filthy animals.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.241
Living in offal and shit
beneath the city.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.826
If we'd known
they were there,

06:16.001 --> 06:17.866
we would be riding
towards Rome

06:18.044 --> 06:19.909
with news
of Spartacus's death.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.874
Now they could be
anywhere.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.881
He would have left the city
to rougher terrain.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.167
It will be no simple task
to sweep such an area.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.882
More men would spur
to purpose.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.263
Attempts to raise soldiers
have borne shriveled fruit.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.425
It is the fault of Seppius.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.310
He's secured every man
familiar with sword as his own.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.095
Perhaps it's time
we called on his support.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.560
He is Varinius' man,

06:41.735 --> 06:44.477
not worthy of such invitation.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.269
And yet his men
prove a necessity.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.313
If we had them
in the marketplace,

06:48.491 --> 06:51.449
Spartacus would never have
found himself so close to you.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.986
The gods conspire
against you.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.489
Return to your quarters.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.454
They demand proper offering,

07:00.629 --> 07:02.460
one of blood and sacrifice.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.830
You speak of ritual?

07:05.008 --> 07:07.374
To restore this house

07:07.552 --> 07:11.295
and to force our enemies
to their knees.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.470
See yourself to market

07:16.645 --> 07:21.139
to gather what you require
when sun greets day.

07:21.316 --> 07:25.184
And we shall confer
with Seppius.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.603
I'll make arrangement.

07:35.413 --> 07:39.656
You believe the gods
will heed your prayers?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.371
If my cause is just.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.379
Then entreat them
to divine

07:46.549 --> 07:49.757
where Spartacus
has gone to ground

07:49.928 --> 07:53.796
before the villain
robs another Roman of his life.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.489
(gasping )

08:25.505 --> 08:26.745
(gags)

08:31.219 --> 08:32.425
(yells)

08:32.595 --> 08:35.883
Tiberius, I would finish.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.593
Place cock in ass.

08:40.854 --> 08:41.934
- ( men yell)
- Come on.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.471
- ( yelling outside)
- ( metal clanging )

08:44.649 --> 08:46.480
My robes! Quickly!

09:48.588 --> 09:50.579
(women yelling )

09:50.757 --> 09:53.248
( overlapping chatter)

09:55.845 --> 09:58.302
Strike fear, and quiet concern.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.634
Our quarrel is not with you.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.300
It's with those that would
place themselves your master...

10:04.729 --> 10:07.562
a title that bears
no meaning to us,

10:07.732 --> 10:10.724
nor to you now,
should you wish it so.

10:12.153 --> 10:15.145
You are presented choice
as we once were:

10:16.616 --> 10:20.484
to submit forever
to Roman cruelty

10:21.621 --> 10:24.658
or take up arms
and to join us in freedom.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.907
( whispers )

10:27.085 --> 10:29.667
And who are you
to present such fucking offer?

10:33.758 --> 10:35.134
I am Spartacus.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.135
(gasping, murmuring)

10:39.305 --> 10:41.045
Still your fucking tongues!

10:42.684 --> 10:44.640
Are you the dominus
of this house?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.272
lam.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.395
( blade scrapes )

10:50.567 --> 10:52.148
Then we should have words.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.695
(yells)

10:58.825 --> 11:00.190
What is it you seek?!

11:01.536 --> 11:03.447
Give desire voice,
and see it satisfied.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.454
You are a man
of fucking influence.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.580
Yes. Yes.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.367
l have the ear
of the magistrate.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.502
I can deliver message.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.631
It is message sent to you
which I have interest in.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.589
You were friends of Batiatus,
were you not?

11:20.763 --> 11:23.175
(whimpering)

11:23.349 --> 11:25.431
Were you not?!

11:25.602 --> 11:28.765
I knew him only in passing.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.646
He was filled with mad dreams

11:32.817 --> 11:35.229
of rising
in prominence of office.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.738
Yet he needed support.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.273
To gain it, he sent a gift

11:41.451 --> 11:43.863
from villa to villa
in this region,

11:46.414 --> 11:47.915
a woman.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.124
- A woman.
- You know of her?

11:51.294 --> 11:53.580
If I do...

11:53.755 --> 11:55.791
my life yet spared?

11:58.343 --> 12:01.676
Speak while you still
have fucking tongue!

12:04.891 --> 12:06.927
She was-- she was here.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.352
She was here.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.727
You would break false word
to Jupiter himself

12:11.898 --> 12:13.934
just to see another dawn.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.564
No, no. No.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.568
Dark of skin.
Hair roughly shorn.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.400
The mark of her domina
upon the back of her shoulder.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.782
Where is she?

12:24.953 --> 12:27.615
I do not know.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.371
She was put to cart after.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.242
After?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.836
How-- how--

12:38.007 --> 12:41.591
how could I know
that she held meaning?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.173
Did she not breathe?

12:44.347 --> 12:47.054
Did her heart not beat
like any other woman's?

12:48.101 --> 12:51.093
Yet you did not see
a woman, did you?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.183
You just saw something
to be used and discarded.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.690
- Please.
- You just saw a fucking slave!

12:59.737 --> 13:01.728
- ( laughter)
- ( crashing )

13:03.533 --> 13:05.114
Everything is in the back.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.612
Yeah!

13:10.790 --> 13:12.621
Take everything.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.828
Your beauty stirs my cock.

13:15.003 --> 13:18.040
A rise too slight
for eyes to notice.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.670
-( laughter)
- Hey!

13:22.844 --> 13:24.209
That's how it's done.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.718
( cheering )

13:25.888 --> 13:27.799
That one smells of shit.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.430
From where does he hail?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.851
Gallia.

13:31.019 --> 13:35.012
Gauls, they fuck absent regard
of pleasing a woman.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.935
A skill lacking in most men.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.146
And what of Spartacus?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.606
How does he stand?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.941
Above the rest...

13:45.116 --> 13:46.526
in all regard.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.282
Apologies.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.863
I did not know he was yours.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.697
I do not claim him
in such terms,

13:53.875 --> 13:55.615
nor would he be
so enslaved.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.455
He offers you protection
in return for affections.

13:59.714 --> 14:00.920
We have no such
arrangement.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.046
Is it love then?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.138
Of course.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.890
The hope of love to come.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.473
A danger in its own right.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.479
I need an accounting
of all food and supplies.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.685
Find Vitus and see it done.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.571
We suffered no casualties,

14:30.745 --> 14:32.201
though Liscus and Acer
took minor wounds.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.204
The Gauls grow careless.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.911
How many weapons were secured?

14:37.085 --> 14:38.700
Enough to see
a dozen more men well armed.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.459
And we will put them to use

14:40.630 --> 14:42.962
in the next villa that we take.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.293
The dominus?

14:45.468 --> 14:48.210
He recalled a slave

14:48.388 --> 14:49.753
marked the same as Naevia.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.796
Where was she taken?

14:51.974 --> 14:54.135
She was put to cart

14:54.310 --> 14:55.925
to be passed
to the next fucking dominus.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.469
Crixus.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.851
We will find her, brother,
and see everyone

15:05.029 --> 15:07.862
that has kept her from your arms
to the afterlife.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.897
J‘ ...rains down
from an angry sky J‘

15:10.076 --> 15:11.737
J‘ My cock rages on J‘

15:11.911 --> 15:13.651
J‘ My cock rages on. J‘

15:13.830 --> 15:16.663
I will see to my men

15:16.833 --> 15:18.789
and Rhaskos's cock to cover.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.951
( laughter)

15:21.129 --> 15:22.915
Ah, Crixus.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.003
Get down.

15:25.174 --> 15:28.007
He is given crumbs,

15:28.177 --> 15:29.838
yet you present
his fucking meal.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.594
His heart aches
for nourishment.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.596
I would have it well fed.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.384
Even if Naevia lives,

15:37.562 --> 15:39.894
she will not be the woman
he holds to memory.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.929
If we are to stand against Glaber
and the Romans,

15:42.108 --> 15:44.064
we must liberate fighting men,

15:44.235 --> 15:45.816
not waste effort
on dwindling hope

15:45.987 --> 15:48.945
- and worthless house slaves.
- Every man has his worth,

15:51.701 --> 15:53.487
alesson
the Romans will soon learn.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.872
The bonds of slavery
have been struck.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.533
Never again

16:02.712 --> 16:06.170
will you feel them tighten
around your neck

16:07.550 --> 16:11.714
robbing you
of breath and life.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.259
See your own join
your brothers

16:16.434 --> 16:19.141
and take up just cause.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.104
We will see the Romans bleed
for taking us as dogs,

16:24.650 --> 16:27.107
to be yanked by the leash
at their command.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.979
Tychos, Sophus,

16:31.157 --> 16:32.522
weapons.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.415
Now...

16:46.297 --> 16:48.663
who would have blood?

16:52.595 --> 16:55.428
This place...

16:55.598 --> 16:59.136
the very air clings
to the flesh, tainting it.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.972
Close eyes, Domina,

17:02.146 --> 17:04.011
and replace thought.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.460
(gasping )

17:53.155 --> 17:54.941
||ithyia.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.526
( gasps )

17:58.160 --> 18:00.902
Oh, Gaius.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.955
You give heart
cause to flutter.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.201
The water ripples
in evidence.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.212
The result of your child

18:11.382 --> 18:14.169
and firm kick
upon swollen belly.

18:15.803 --> 18:20.092
Such aggression
prophesies a boy.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.052
Would I give you any less?

18:22.226 --> 18:24.091
You have given me much of late.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.979
YOursacﬁﬁce
hasnotgoneunnoﬁced.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.809
Yet there is more
that I would ask.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.069
You need but command it.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.652
Escort Lucretia
to market at dawn.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.407
She intends ceremony
to cleanse this house

18:40.578 --> 18:42.034
and deliver my enemies.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.456
The gods
would rather piss on Rome

18:44.624 --> 18:46.660
than whisper in her ear.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.667
People of this city
believe her prophet.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.247
She is not to be trusted.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.538
It was not long ago
you named her friend.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.422
A mistake dearly paid for.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.175
A sum costing us both.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.964
You truly believe her blessed?

19:05.269 --> 19:07.100
Spartacus must fall

19:07.271 --> 19:08.932
if we are to be
returned to Rome,

19:09.106 --> 19:10.892
and lam willing to believe

19:11.067 --> 19:12.648
whatever revelations
tumble from her lips

19:12.818 --> 19:16.652
if they shall hasten
such a day.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.366
Now...

19:21.202 --> 19:24.569
see yourself dried
by loving hands

19:24.747 --> 19:26.658
and to our bed.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.160
( bleats )

19:33.339 --> 19:36.046
Spartacus: Oh, to have
a proper bed once more.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.387
It's been a lifetime.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.506
l have never
known such a thing.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.476
Then it is much deserved.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.973
Spartacus...

19:55.528 --> 19:57.359
what we share...

19:59.365 --> 20:01.105
what meaning
does it hold for you?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.533
What answer would you have?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.495
One spoken from the heart.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.295
l have feasted so long
on pain and sorrow,

20:17.967 --> 20:20.379
it is difficult
to recall sweeter taste

20:23.431 --> 20:26.423
except when you
are in my arms.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.182
Then let me
never be from them.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.310
Spartacus!

20:48.497 --> 20:50.283
You've already killed me once.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.073
Do not hesitate
to revisit the deed.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.537
He did nothing
but offer freedom,

20:54.712 --> 20:56.122
and this is how you repay?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.753
It was not his to grant!

20:59.759 --> 21:01.624
I had position and respect.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.383
You were a slave,

21:03.554 --> 21:06.170
everything you possessed
a mere fleeting illusion.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.724
You but take my master's place.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.259
And what would your master
do now,

21:11.437 --> 21:14.179
if he stood so assaulted?

21:14.356 --> 21:15.516
He would see me dead.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.234
Yes, he would.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.659
You yet wish
to train this fuck?

21:28.829 --> 21:31.036
The boy deserves opportunity.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.868
He was given such a thing

21:33.042 --> 21:36.455
and made attempt
on your life in response.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.085
Gods save me.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.792
| find myself in agreement
with a Gaul.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.672
He has known nothing
but slavery,

21:42.843 --> 21:46.256
the strength of such a tether
not easily severed.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.342
- Perhaps never to be so.
- And if we take his life?

21:49.517 --> 21:51.178
What message
will that send to those

21:51.352 --> 21:52.592
who wish to join our cause?

21:52.770 --> 21:54.226
That they
had best be agreeable.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.385
We're Romans then?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.850
Commanding through fear
and threat of death?

21:58.025 --> 22:00.232
If he makes attempt again,

22:00.402 --> 22:03.360
I will make sure hejoins
his fucking dominus.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.994
And how do you propose
we train this wild little dog?

22:17.795 --> 22:20.036
As Batiatus
had Doctore train me.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.421
And that turned out so well.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.673
( crowd cheering )

22:47.408 --> 22:51.321
Liberius draws plumbatae!

22:51.495 --> 22:52.484
-(cheeﬁng)
-(snaﬂs)

22:57.084 --> 23:00.918
Addonexus selects vinculum!

23:01.088 --> 23:02.919
( cheering )

23:07.469 --> 23:09.596
(yells)

23:14.977 --> 23:16.683
Take his fucking head off!

23:41.545 --> 23:43.536
Go on! Come on!

23:45.007 --> 23:47.498
- ( yells)
- Yeah!

24:02.858 --> 24:03.847
Release him.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.526
- ( groans)
- Broken.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.205
A minor injury,

24:17.373 --> 24:19.284
meant only to instruct.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.164
( groans )

24:23.379 --> 24:24.835
I stand in victory in my match,

24:25.005 --> 24:27.621
yet Doctore provides
only lash and rod as reward.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.961
You believe
you deserve otherwise?

24:30.135 --> 24:33.719
This is a house of champions,
Oenomaus.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.800
It does not submit to you.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.465
You submit to it.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.013
Yes, Dominus.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.184
One must learn to kneel
if he is ever to rise.

24:48.362 --> 24:51.069
A necessary lesson

24:51.240 --> 24:52.480
if you are to one day

24:52.658 --> 24:54.523
join the champions
of the House of Batiatus.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.985
How is such a thing possible?

24:59.581 --> 25:02.664
The answer lies
within your breast.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.669
You fight with a strength of men
beyond your meager years,

25:06.839 --> 25:10.673
yet lack the discipline
to see it properly harnessed.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.801
Quintus, two cups of mulsum.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.678
Tell me what I must do.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.019
The most difficult of tasks.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.809
You must discover your purpose.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.521
- My purpose?
- That which you fight for.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.151
I fight to stay alive.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.936
( laughs)

25:33.115 --> 25:35.697
As do we all.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.610
But to grasp the heavens,

25:38.787 --> 25:40.903
you must fight
for something greater,

25:41.081 --> 25:43.572
something beyond
mere survival.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.617
You are my dominus.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.581
I fight for whatever you decide.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.542
No, no.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.752
This is a decision each man,

25:52.926 --> 25:56.760
whether slave or freeborn,
must forge himself.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.592
It is yours alone.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.773
To your purpose

26:13.947 --> 26:16.939
and the destiny
it shall lead you to.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.784
(yells)

26:34.176 --> 26:35.712
Yeah!

26:46.522 --> 26:49.104
Come on! Bring it!

27:04.414 --> 27:06.450
(grunting)

27:15.592 --> 27:17.583
( cheering )

27:23.475 --> 27:27.343
Addonexus, victor!

27:29.356 --> 27:30.516
Yeah!

27:34.695 --> 27:36.686
Just fucking barely.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.859
Send another to face me.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.779
And what of his opponent?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.612
Send him as well.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.075
You wish to leave this world,

27:51.253 --> 27:53.209
I shall ferry you.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.958
Addonexus thirsts
for yet more blood.

27:59.136 --> 28:02.378
- ( cheering )
- And he shall have it!

28:06.268 --> 28:08.133
Last position!

28:08.312 --> 28:09.802
- Attack!
- ( metal clanging )

28:09.980 --> 28:11.436
(grunting)

28:11.607 --> 28:12.892
Keep your left arm up!

28:17.863 --> 28:19.478
-( blade slaps )
- ( growls )

28:19.656 --> 28:21.317
You carry a shield
as well as sword.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.822
Not the man, the shoulder.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.779
-Again.
- ( men grunt)

28:24.953 --> 28:26.363
Attack!

28:29.249 --> 28:30.534
Good.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.705
( groans )

28:33.879 --> 28:36.086
You expose flank,

28:36.256 --> 28:37.712
the ruin of many a great man.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.123
I'm no fucking soldier.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.041
( laughs)

28:44.556 --> 28:45.841
Not yet.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.054
First and second position.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.594
- Attack!
- ( men grunting)

28:51.772 --> 28:52.761
lt's heavier than I imagined.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.646
It will lighten in time.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.774
And when it becomes
as a feather,

28:57.945 --> 28:59.810
what purpose
do you think it shall fly to?

29:04.326 --> 29:06.612
One of your own choosing.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.121
Now set foot to path...

29:11.291 --> 29:13.703
- And second positions!
- ...and come at me again.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.253
- Attack!
- ( men grunt )

29:23.303 --> 29:25.794
Should have put the boy down.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.713
A dog bites once,

29:27.891 --> 29:29.802
he will bare
fucking teeth again.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.301
Pity.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.319
( goat bleats )

29:44.825 --> 29:47.237
Why do they stare?

29:47.411 --> 29:49.447
How could they not

29:49.621 --> 29:51.703
when one blessed by the gods
moves among them?

29:51.873 --> 29:53.488
The gods?

29:54.918 --> 29:55.907
Oh, yes.

29:56.086 --> 29:59.795
You rarely spoke of them
in times past.

29:59.965 --> 30:03.128
Now the divine is held
as confidant and council.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.135
Much has changed.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.886
( bleating )

30:08.056 --> 30:09.512
Curious words

30:09.683 --> 30:13.642
from one who claims
no memory of the past.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.772
Shadows of it begin to form
in the light of a new day.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.182
(goat bleating )

30:20.360 --> 30:23.523
What shape do they take?

30:23.697 --> 30:25.779
One of secrets
passed between us.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.692
You confessed
that you do not always heed

30:29.870 --> 30:32.862
the commands of your father
oryourhusband.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.782
( laughs)

30:36.960 --> 30:39.952
You speak of my first visit
to your villa...

30:41.423 --> 30:44.256
when we had yet to come
to truly know one another.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.758
I so wished to please you.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.763
You're the wife of the legatus.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.095
Such a gift.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.436
You do not know what it means

30:58.607 --> 31:01.019
to find you within the walls
of my house once again,

31:01.193 --> 31:05.937
filling it with life
and promise.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.777
To survive such barbarity,

31:09.951 --> 31:13.159
you are truly touched
by the gods.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.616
Gratitude.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.700
May the gods bless you.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.168
(crowd murmuring)

31:22.339 --> 31:23.829
May the gods bless you.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.713
- Lucretia.
- Lucretia.

31:25.884 --> 31:26.873
||ithyia.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.417
Bless me.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.801
They seem
rather taken with her.

31:29.971 --> 31:33.429
Seppia. A welcome sight.

31:35.977 --> 31:39.185
Unless you intend tribute to
the oracle of Batiatus as well.

31:39.356 --> 31:41.722
I do not push about in throngs.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.733
| find the odor of desperation
lingers upon garment.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.643
We are of similar mind.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.938
More so tethered
by blood and marriage.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.482
My brother only just departed
to sit with your husband.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.367
- Men and their politics.
- Let us leave them to it

31:54.538 --> 31:57.951
and turn thought
toward more pressing subject.

31:58.125 --> 32:01.458
What news
of latest scandal from Rome?

32:01.628 --> 32:03.744
Husband and coming child

32:03.922 --> 32:05.537
have drawn attention
from such events.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.842
I cannot believe you
so removed.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.874
You are acquainted
with positively everybody.

32:10.053 --> 32:12.840
And yet desired
by more than a few.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.845
( giggles )
How I envy such attentions.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.507
And how I miss them.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.223
Must all joy be so abandoned
when weighted with husband?

32:22.399 --> 32:24.230
It must

32:24.401 --> 32:26.938
if a woman is
of proper breeding.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.068
Oh.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.945
How miserable.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.856
Perhaps I should
entreat the gods

32:33.034 --> 32:35.195
to shield me from such dour fate.
( laughs )

32:39.291 --> 32:41.202
Lucretia:
May the gods bless you.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.334
- May the gods bless you.
- Lucretia.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.960
- Lucretia.
- May the gods bless you.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.371
- Lucretia.
- It's a sign.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.289
May the gods bless you

32:49.468 --> 32:51.379
- Lucretia.
- Lucretia.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.339
May the gods bless you.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.360
Lucretia.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.815
Bless me. Bless me.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.901
May the gods bless you.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.066
- Lucretia.
- Lucretia.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.908
Spartacus was one of yours,
was he not?

33:24.085 --> 33:28.954
During your overly brief
campaign in Thrace.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.874
Conscripted to the auxiliary.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.794
An animal prone
to disobedience even then.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.177
A beast you brought
to our shores.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.804
To die in the arena.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.180
Yet he lives,

33:39.351 --> 33:42.184
a pleasure denied
my noble cousin Sextus.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.141
Many have suffered injury.

33:46.483 --> 33:50.442
To be healed by news
of Spartacus' fall.

33:50.612 --> 33:53.069
A venture I eagerly
set hands to months past.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.572
Yes, word touched me
in the Senate of your efforts.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.905
How many of your men
has he sent to the afterlife?

33:59.079 --> 34:01.035
(sighs)

34:01.206 --> 34:03.743
The man proves resourceful,

34:03.917 --> 34:07.250
as he did when he set upon you
in the market square.

34:08.630 --> 34:12.794
It is a pity my men were not
present to end the matter.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.593
Spartacus stands
a common foe, as I said.

34:17.764 --> 34:22.178
Yes, my tribune cleaves
to the heart of it.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.850
Spartacus is enemy
to us both,

34:27.023 --> 34:29.105
shared in offense
and blood,

34:29.276 --> 34:32.985
so let us
sweep aside differences

34:33.154 --> 34:36.487
and in union
see him forced to knee.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.995
I would need to consult Varinius
towards such agreement.

34:48.169 --> 34:49.545
Are they your men or his?

34:51.131 --> 34:53.838
And who would lead
combined effort?

34:54.009 --> 34:57.251
You shall hold
station of note,

34:57.429 --> 34:59.636
second only
to my command,

34:59.806 --> 35:02.388
and promise
that you shall be present

35:02.559 --> 35:04.345
when Spartacus
is put to grass.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.601
The man takes habit of slipping
through your fingers.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.262
What moves you
to certainty of victory?

35:09.441 --> 35:11.056
Because the gods
themselves will it.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.690
They speak with you now,
do they?

35:12.861 --> 35:14.772
Through voice of former domina
of this very house.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.028
-( laughs ) Lucretia?
- They have blessed her,

35:17.198 --> 35:19.234
as they blessed her
the night they guided her

35:19.409 --> 35:20.865
from death
in the massacre.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.995
Yet she is not alone
in such fortune.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.326
Did the gods not...

35:27.500 --> 35:32.085
guide your wife
to safety as well?

35:34.507 --> 35:36.543
llithyia took leave

35:36.718 --> 35:39.425
before unfortunate turn.

35:39.596 --> 35:43.009
And with her,
a clutch of your men

35:44.142 --> 35:46.724
soldiers that might have
tipped the balance

35:46.895 --> 35:50.012
towards halting Spartacus
short of fucking slaughter.

35:50.190 --> 35:53.023
You will tend your words with
more care in my presence, boy.

35:53.193 --> 35:56.105
- Come, let us take seat--
- My words are carefully chosen

35:56.279 --> 35:58.656
for a man holding title

35:58.823 --> 36:01.075
as favor to his wife's father.

36:03.828 --> 36:08.162
You speak to me
in such manner again,

36:08.333 --> 36:10.619
and I will have your tongue.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.252
Yet not my men.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.053
J‘ ...cock rages on,
my cock rages on J‘

36:24.224 --> 36:27.261
J‘ I put you down,
I give you shit J‘

36:27.435 --> 36:30.768
J‘ I piss on your grave
for the sport of it J‘

36:30.939 --> 36:33.976
J‘ And when I die,
expect no less J‘

36:34.150 --> 36:37.688
J‘ My mind is gone,
my cock rages on. J‘

36:37.862 --> 36:40.194
( cheering )

36:40.365 --> 36:41.354
You.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.319
Slave, see my jug filled.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.984
Rhaskos.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.737
Fetch drink yourself.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.036
Do not fucking drain jug
before return, slave.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.921
-( laughter)
- J‘ Fight to fuck J‘

36:59.092 --> 37:01.424
J‘ Fuck to fight,
I fight to fuck again... J‘

37:01.594 --> 37:04.256
You offer privilege
before it is properly earned.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.763
And you would have them bow
and scrape in service

37:06.933 --> 37:08.093
as they did
before their dominus?

37:08.268 --> 37:10.429
No.

37:10.603 --> 37:14.437
Yet neither would I have them
seen as equal.

37:14.607 --> 37:17.314
They were not forged
of the brotherhood, as we were.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.486
They join our cause
of their own free will.

37:21.656 --> 37:25.365
Such fire may yet
prove more fierce.

37:25.535 --> 37:28.277
Or be extinguished
by threatening storm.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.910
I would move at first light.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.620
There are yet more villas.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.785
(men yelling)

37:44.804 --> 37:46.965
You press fortune

37:47.140 --> 37:49.973
glaring so
at the Slayer of Theokoles.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.725
His victory
but proving even giants fall.

37:52.896 --> 37:53.976
( laughs)

37:58.818 --> 38:01.195
What name do you go by,
little man?

38:01.362 --> 38:03.148
So I may properly
mourn your passing.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.314
I'm called Tiberius.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.198
Tiberius?

38:07.368 --> 38:09.745
You are far too dark
to have such a fair Roman name.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.449
I'm more Roman than Syrian.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.407
There was a Syrian at our ludus.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.412
A treacherous fuck,
if ever there breathed.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.456
You had family there?

38:25.804 --> 38:27.419
| only recall a brother.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.930
I too had a brother.

38:32.435 --> 38:33.811
No longer?

38:37.190 --> 38:38.976
He was struck down
by the Romans.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.142
When you turned swords
against them?

38:46.866 --> 38:49.323
As you shall one day

38:49.494 --> 38:52.201
if you hold any fucking sense.

39:07.929 --> 39:08.918
Look at me.

39:09.097 --> 39:13.557
I would see that pretty face
as I finish.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.307
You fucking animal!

39:18.481 --> 39:20.437
- Mira!
- Go!

39:20.608 --> 39:22.064
Or part with your cock.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.771
If you were
not Spartacus' bitch,

39:23.945 --> 39:26.857
I would show you
how to use that and my cock.

39:29.075 --> 39:30.940
Apologies.
I will see that Rhaskos--

39:31.119 --> 39:32.484
I chose to lay
with the fucking Gaul.

39:32.662 --> 39:35.074
Why?

39:35.248 --> 39:37.079
Not all of us have Spartacus
warm our beds

39:37.250 --> 39:38.456
and see us to position.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.241
You gain freedom

39:40.420 --> 39:42.251
only to be enslaved
by that shit?

39:42.422 --> 39:44.458
Freedom is not without cost.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.465
I pay with the only coin l have.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.375
As do you.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.423
( men cheering )

40:21.169 --> 40:23.376
Perhaps we should
stand further away

40:23.546 --> 40:27.038
for fear of errant bolt
from the heavens.

40:27.216 --> 40:31.050
Such ritual may bring profit,
absentcost

40:31.220 --> 40:33.506
The goat came
at no small expense.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.381
The gods whisper
of deceit and treachery

40:36.559 --> 40:40.017
and give assurance
that those who would harbor

40:40.188 --> 40:43.305
secrets against you
shall be brought to light.

40:49.739 --> 40:51.604
Accept our offering

40:53.034 --> 40:57.323
and bless us with your favor
against our enemies.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.249
Is it wise

41:07.423 --> 41:09.755
to allow such unsteady hands
to play with knives?

41:09.926 --> 41:11.666
Hold tongue.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.547
( bleats )

42:02.729 --> 42:04.845
Your will, my hands.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.560
Hmm.

42:07.734 --> 42:09.599
Perhaps another goat?

42:10.737 --> 42:12.193
When ritual is ended,

42:12.363 --> 42:14.524
see blood cleansed

42:14.699 --> 42:16.655
and Lucretia attended.

42:22.707 --> 42:24.698
( crowd cheering )

42:27.545 --> 42:29.536
( footsteps )

42:30.631 --> 42:34.044
You are to fight Caratacus next,

42:34.218 --> 42:36.254
a beast that has claimed
many lives.

42:36.429 --> 42:39.341
You believe he shall end mine?

42:39.515 --> 42:41.426
In your condition?
( laughs)

42:43.686 --> 42:46.223
If he does not,

42:46.397 --> 42:47.978
send one that will.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.807
Spectator:
Get up! Get up!

43:05.708 --> 43:07.448
You have taken
important step

43:07.627 --> 43:11.165
towards rising above
base animal.

43:12.215 --> 43:15.002
lt shames me
I fought in that place,

43:15.176 --> 43:16.586
absent thoughts of honor.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.376
The Pits are for men whose lives

43:18.554 --> 43:20.090
promise nothing greater
than an ugly end.

43:20.264 --> 43:23.756
You are destined
for far grander fate.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.641
The arena.

43:25.812 --> 43:28.098
Place where legends are forged.

43:29.232 --> 43:32.474
I fear for those that dare
take the sands against you.

43:32.652 --> 43:34.608
I shall make
their deaths memorable.

43:34.779 --> 43:35.985
The gods will be pleased.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.895
I do not fight for the gods.

43:41.702 --> 43:45.536
I fight for you.
That is my purpose, my life,

43:45.706 --> 43:47.367
to honor the House of Batiatus.

43:53.089 --> 43:55.455
The honor is mine.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.546
(thunder rumbles)

44:05.601 --> 44:08.217
(crowd yelling )

44:08.396 --> 44:09.761
Yeah!

44:15.236 --> 44:17.397
( cheering )

44:42.763 --> 44:44.719
- Come on! Finish it!
- Yeah.

44:44.891 --> 44:46.176
Take his head off!

44:59.697 --> 45:01.983
Here. His blade!

46:02.426 --> 46:03.415
( blade strikes )

46:05.888 --> 46:07.879
( crowd groaning )

46:15.439 --> 46:16.849
You.

46:22.697 --> 46:23.686
Domina!

46:23.864 --> 46:25.820
Men approach.

46:29.537 --> 46:31.619
Torches arriving from the north.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.370
How many?

46:33.541 --> 46:34.872
Six, maybe more.
Gather the men.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.782
Spartacus: Wait.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.701
These may be scouts
from a larger force.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.744
If a single rider
was to escape our grasp,

46:40.923 --> 46:42.379
it could bring
a far greater concern.

46:42.550 --> 46:43.881
Then we shall grip tightly.

46:47.847 --> 46:49.587
There is a better way,

46:49.765 --> 46:53.508
one that will keep our movements
yet hidden from the Romans.

46:53.686 --> 46:55.267
( bangs on door)

47:02.153 --> 47:04.735
I would have words
with your dominus,

47:04.905 --> 47:06.987
on orders of Seppius.

47:07.158 --> 47:09.740
Apologies. Business has
called him to Picentia.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.614
Picentia?

47:12.788 --> 47:14.619
l have never known him
to favor the city.

47:14.790 --> 47:16.781
He does not.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.790
He favors its whores.

47:19.879 --> 47:21.961
( laughs)

47:22.131 --> 47:24.838
You are his body slave,
are you not?

47:25.009 --> 47:26.670
Tiberius.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.300
Tiberius.

47:28.471 --> 47:30.007
Tell me...

47:31.349 --> 47:33.055
why are you
not at your dominus' side?

47:35.853 --> 47:37.434
Because there's
no one he trusts more

47:37.605 --> 47:39.266
to see his villa attended

47:39.440 --> 47:41.351
while his cock is satisfied.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.942
You serve your master well.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.576
Return to your charge.

47:59.126 --> 48:00.741
Wait.

48:04.799 --> 48:07.916
You have come
a fair distance from Capua.

48:08.094 --> 48:10.005
Come, and lwill
give you something

48:10.179 --> 48:11.919
to make effort worthwhile.

48:12.098 --> 48:14.510
He betrays us.

48:14.683 --> 48:16.719
(yells)

49:15.411 --> 49:16.947
Spartacus!

49:18.914 --> 49:21.656
( man yells )

49:37.725 --> 49:38.931
Why did you stop them
from leaving?

49:39.101 --> 49:40.090
He killed a man.

49:40.269 --> 49:42.305
When he saw
they would not win.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.595
His eyes fell to my neck.

49:43.772 --> 49:44.932
He saw the absence
of my collar.

49:45.107 --> 49:46.847
lfl had not allowed him in,

49:47.026 --> 49:48.562
he would have returned
with more men.

49:55.284 --> 49:58.117
You did well, Tiberius.

49:58.287 --> 50:00.619
Nasir.

50:02.041 --> 50:03.656
My brother called me Nasir.

50:14.970 --> 50:17.962
Who disturbs peace
at such an hour?

50:25.189 --> 50:26.850
I come bearing a gift

50:27.024 --> 50:31.768
which shall set you upon path
to the fall of Spartacus.

50:37.117 --> 50:39.244
The gods truly heed my prayers.
