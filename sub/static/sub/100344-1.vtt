-Always.

just one more question.

Feel free not to answer,
but do you have any idea

-Hang in, I'll be right back.

just a massive mistake

31:08.601 --> 31:10.267
that we can clear up
right here and now

31:10.351 --> 31:12.434
or have you both lost
your fucking minds?

31:12.518 --> 31:14.017
There's nothing wrong
with my fucking mind.

31:14.101 --> 31:15.393
What did he tell you?

31:16.601 --> 31:17.810
"Wait 'til my lawyer gets here."

31:17.893 --> 31:19.559
I assumed that. I mean
when you first brought him in

31:19.643 --> 31:22.267
-for questioning.
-There was no initial interview.

31:23.851 --> 31:25.476
HOWARD: Hold on.

31:25.559 --> 31:29.393
You arrested him
in front of over 100 people

without giving him a chance
to explain himself,

31:32.101 --> 31:34.476

to verify his story?

we didn't want to risk
that he would run.

in front of his family
and his neighbors...

as easily posted cops

waited for the game to be over,

at his home.

Ralph, I know you.
You're a decent guy. Why?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.685
First off, Howard,
I didn't arrest him.

32:01.768 --> 32:04.851
I had Don Harrier and Tom Yates
do that for me,

32:04.935 --> 32:08.476
and the reason being if I had
to put my hands on him,

32:08.559 --> 32:10.226
I don't know
that I could've trusted myself

32:10.309 --> 32:13.059
not to beat the fucking shit
out of him.

32:13.142 --> 32:15.726
I didn't want to give you that
to work with at trial.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.184

just walked around the hotel,

of the Braves game.

another panel. We attended that,

Slaughterhouse Five is banned

45:30.559 --> 45:35.226
in part because, I guess,
of its unsparing take on war,

45:35.309 --> 45:37.559

if any of you
could respond to that.
