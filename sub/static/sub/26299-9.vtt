WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.797
What the hell?

00:02.852 --> 00:05.134
Oh, my God.
He brought Mom's old car?

00:05.199 --> 00:06.955
You know,
that thing was perfect for Dede...

00:07.020 --> 00:08.697
loud, pulled way to the left,

00:08.762 --> 00:10.771
and constantly
broke down in public.

00:11.207 --> 00:13.736
My ex-wife, Dede,
died two months ago,

00:13.916 --> 00:16.465
and her husband, Jerry,
drove down with a bunch of junk

00:16.543 --> 00:17.814
she wanted us to have.

00:17.879 --> 00:19.150
I always liked Jerry.

00:19.215 --> 00:21.634
Then why did you always
look at him funny?

00:21.699 --> 00:23.244
Because I knew
what he was in for.

00:23.309 --> 00:24.767
Same way
I look at the footage

00:24.832 --> 00:26.974
of those people
boarding the Titanic.

00:27.176 --> 00:29.501
Jay, this is for you.

00:29.566 --> 00:30.728
Oh, God. Is that her?

00:30.793 --> 00:32.705
No, no, no.
Apparently this is a jar of sand

00:32.770 --> 00:34.251
from your honeymoon
in Miami Beach.

00:34.316 --> 00:36.205
Oh, yeah.
We stayed at the Fontainebleau.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.349
- Hmm.
- Guess who we took an elevator with?

00:38.605 --> 00:39.767
Jackie Gleason.

00:39.832 --> 00:41.334
I told him
we were the honeymooners,

00:41.402 --> 00:42.431
and, as a joke,
he threatened

00:42.496 --> 00:43.771
to punch Dede
to the moon.

00:44.277 --> 00:45.462
Why is that funny?

00:45.527 --> 00:47.056
Well, that's my point.
It wasn't right.

00:47.121 --> 00:50.287
Claire, your mom wanted you
to have her old sports car.

00:50.363 --> 00:51.379
Oh, great.

00:51.457 --> 00:54.955
And Mitchell,
you get to keep her jewelry.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.244
Oh, so Claire gets a car,

00:56.309 --> 00:58.314
and I get a, uh, box of turquoise.

00:58.379 --> 00:59.337
Want to trade?

00:59.402 --> 01:00.353
No. No, it's fine.

01:00.418 --> 01:02.798
I have a preteen girl at home,
and she likes to play dress-up.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.556
And, you know,
Lily might like it, too.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.212
Mitchell and Claire,
Dede wanted you two to decide

01:07.277 --> 01:08.658
who gets to keep her.

01:08.723 --> 01:10.744
Sorry, Jay.
She left you out of this one.

01:10.809 --> 01:12.735
No worries, Jerr.
I'm good with the sand.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.568
Hang on. Uh, what do you mean,
"gets to keep her"?

01:16.248 --> 01:17.509
That's Dede.

01:17.574 --> 01:20.146
We had her ashes organically
fused with the root ball.

01:20.238 --> 01:21.790
That is so Mom.

01:21.855 --> 01:25.158
I know. Setting up one last
thing for us to fight over,

01:25.223 --> 01:27.173
- because neither of us want that tree.
- Because both of us want the tree.

01:27.238 --> 01:29.420
- What?
- That was easy.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.473
Oh, cool.

01:44.551 --> 01:46.930
Look. Nana left us her old
toy box from her house.

01:46.995 --> 01:49.076
Aww,
bless her hoarding heart.

01:49.248 --> 01:51.056
Remember how I used
to hide in here

01:51.121 --> 01:53.357
and pop out like
a scary monster?

01:53.731 --> 01:55.716
I had so much promise
back then.

01:57.898 --> 01:59.646
A stick horse
that vibrates?

01:59.793 --> 02:00.969
I never got the point.

02:01.034 --> 02:02.650
I don't know,
but I remember

02:02.715 --> 02:04.720
spending
hours riding on it.

02:04.785 --> 02:06.459
- Same.
- Hm.

02:06.670 --> 02:09.544
Oh. Lookie here, Alex.

02:09.622 --> 02:11.954
The source of
your greatest shame...

02:12.019 --> 02:13.542
the puzzle
that I solved

02:13.607 --> 02:15.431
but you
never did.

02:15.496 --> 02:16.555
Who cares?

02:16.633 --> 02:17.891
We were
just dumb kids.

02:17.992 --> 02:18.992
Uh, no.

02:19.137 --> 02:20.728
<i>We</i> were dumb kids,

02:20.793 --> 02:22.551
and <i> you</i> were
the genius.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.000
That must eat away at you.

02:24.065 --> 02:25.128
Please.

02:25.252 --> 02:27.610
I'm top of my class
at a prestigious university,

02:27.774 --> 02:29.821
and I co-invented
a technology

02:29.886 --> 02:32.378
that has applications to
astrophysics and medicine.

02:32.494 --> 02:33.904
And give me
that damn puzzle!

02:34.553 --> 02:37.240
Oh, my God, it's Lulu!

02:37.339 --> 02:39.365
She was my favorite toy.

02:39.947 --> 02:41.160
Mm.

02:45.698 --> 02:48.404
I guess I...
I just really miss Nana.

02:48.574 --> 02:49.931
Also I'm pregnant.

02:49.996 --> 02:51.416
Dylan and I haven't told anyone

02:51.481 --> 02:53.415
because I'm still trying
to get my head around it,

02:53.480 --> 02:57.505
but holding Lulu made it
so real.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.615
I'm gonna have
an actual baby.

03:01.457 --> 03:02.669
Aah, I'm so stressed!

03:02.734 --> 03:04.040
I wish it was the '50s

03:04.105 --> 03:05.608
when it was still healthy
to drink and smoke

03:05.673 --> 03:06.920
when you're pregnant.

03:08.149 --> 03:09.887
Wow.

03:10.209 --> 03:12.329
I cannot wait
to restore this baby.

03:12.394 --> 03:13.952
My high school bully
had one.

03:14.115 --> 03:16.607
You'd be surprised
how fast this thing can go.

03:16.675 --> 03:19.353
No problem catching up
with a kid on a bike

03:19.418 --> 03:21.097
who left school
ten minutes early.

03:21.162 --> 03:23.320
I don't know if I want
another half-finished project

03:23.391 --> 03:24.642
rusting away
in the garage.

03:24.707 --> 03:26.767
The only reason I stopped
working on robot lawnmower

03:26.832 --> 03:28.457
was 'cause
he started getting too smart.

03:28.863 --> 03:31.025
Come on, honey.
Let's keep it.

03:31.090 --> 03:33.816
It reminds me
of how crazy my mom could be.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.420
I mean, what mother
has a car like this?

03:36.494 --> 03:38.880
How's this?
We take it for one drive.

03:38.996 --> 03:40.868
If you're not smiling by
the time we come back,

03:40.933 --> 03:41.958
we get rid of it.

03:43.004 --> 03:44.072
- One drive?
- One drive.

03:44.137 --> 03:45.158
- One drive.
- One drive.

03:45.223 --> 03:47.806
Ugh, she used to double-buckle
me and Mitchell

03:47.871 --> 03:48.923
into the front seat.

03:48.988 --> 03:51.119
Between that and the
homemade electric blankets,

03:51.184 --> 03:52.615
it's a wonder
we're still alive.

03:55.137 --> 03:56.182
What's with the plumber?

03:56.247 --> 03:58.197
Did Joe flush his Aquaman
down the toilet again?

03:58.263 --> 04:00.209
No.
When my cousins left,

04:00.274 --> 04:02.486
they said that the hot
water in the guest bedroom

04:02.551 --> 04:03.611
was not working.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.563
The plumber just said that
there's nothing wrong.

04:05.628 --> 04:08.091
<i>Someone</i> turned it off.

04:08.156 --> 04:09.325
Probably Joe.

04:09.390 --> 04:11.435
So, what are we thinking?
No play dates for a week?

04:11.500 --> 04:12.911
I know it was you.

04:12.976 --> 04:15.521
You wanted them gone,
and you froze them out.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.278
I'm admitting nothing,

04:17.343 --> 04:20.327
but you said one cousin
would be here for one day,

04:20.392 --> 04:21.708
and there were
three here for a week.

04:21.773 --> 04:23.181
I never said that.

04:24.301 --> 04:26.040
Why is Jerry still here?

04:26.155 --> 04:28.142
I know.
Something must be wrong.

04:28.241 --> 04:31.629
He's sitting in the car
like a sad little man.

04:31.694 --> 04:33.240
We have to go and invite him in.

04:33.305 --> 04:35.364
No, no, no, no.
He'll move off eventually.

04:35.429 --> 04:37.921
Glor... Street sweeping is
Thursday.

04:39.648 --> 04:41.497
Jerry, is everything okay?

04:41.562 --> 04:43.236
Yeah, does your truck need
a push?

04:43.344 --> 04:44.658
It's the darnedest thing.

04:44.835 --> 04:46.509
I can't seem to drive away.

04:46.811 --> 04:49.337
Dropping off Dede's stuff was
the last check on the ol' list.

04:49.672 --> 04:51.218
Heck if I'm not feeling
pretty lost.

04:51.283 --> 04:53.814
Yeah, I get it.
Listen, you just drive down this street,

04:53.879 --> 04:55.474
turn right,
and you'll hit the freeway.

04:55.539 --> 04:57.153
Jerry, just come inside.

04:57.218 --> 04:58.244
No, I couldn't.

04:58.309 --> 04:59.747
Yeah, got to love a man
with pride.

04:59.812 --> 05:02.052
That's the thing that'll
serve you well on the freeway.

05:02.117 --> 05:04.314
Just come inside,
I'll make you something to eat,

05:04.379 --> 05:05.874
and you can stay
as long as you want.

05:05.939 --> 05:06.976
Right, Jay?

05:07.041 --> 05:08.502
One of these days, Gloria.

05:08.567 --> 05:09.859
One of these days
what?

05:09.924 --> 05:11.709
Nothing.
Just one of these days.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.260
All right.
Where should we put Mom?

05:15.325 --> 05:16.648
Uh, not too close
to the window.

05:16.713 --> 05:18.447
Don't want to spend
the next 20 years whispering.

05:18.512 --> 05:20.705
Okay, so,
your mom can be a tree,

05:20.770 --> 05:22.072
but when I told you
my Uncle Honus

05:22.137 --> 05:23.940
fell into a thresher
and the next spring,

05:24.005 --> 05:25.916
an owl appeared
with his exact face

05:25.981 --> 05:27.579
and pocket watch,
you poo-pooed it.

05:27.644 --> 05:29.151
Why are you
being so difficult?

05:29.216 --> 05:30.966
Because when we
first got together,

05:31.130 --> 05:33.298
you promised that someday
we would move back

05:33.363 --> 05:35.354
to my family farm,
and every year,

05:35.419 --> 05:36.557
the someday
gets kicked

05:36.622 --> 05:38.283
further down the road
like a nosy census taker.

05:38.348 --> 05:40.861
And... And once you plant
your mom here,

05:40.926 --> 05:42.150
we're never
gonna leave.

05:42.215 --> 05:43.222
That's crazy.

05:43.287 --> 05:44.717
And I-I-I don't think
you want to

05:44.782 --> 05:46.557
talk about promises
we made back then.

05:46.622 --> 05:47.697
What are you
suggesting?

05:47.762 --> 05:49.433
I've kept every promise
I've made.

05:49.498 --> 05:51.322
Really?
You promised me

05:51.387 --> 05:53.119
a rose a
month for the rest of my life,

05:53.184 --> 05:55.549
so
I guess I dropped dead 15 years ago.

05:55.614 --> 05:56.912
I read an article that said
it was

05:56.977 --> 05:59.424
- environmentally ins...
- I've never seen you read an article.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.829
Also, you said
you'd finally watch "E.T.,"

06:01.894 --> 06:03.204
my all-time
favorite movie.

06:03.269 --> 06:04.935
Oh, it just seems
so stupid.

06:05.137 --> 06:06.268
What am I caring about?

06:06.333 --> 06:08.033
A wrinkly puppet
with a Christmas light

06:08.098 --> 06:10.040
at the end of his creepy finger?
And really?

06:10.105 --> 06:11.384
Me saying
I would watch

06:11.449 --> 06:13.181
some pandering
sap-fest is the same

06:13.246 --> 06:16.618
as you saying I would someday
be reunited with my family?

06:16.683 --> 06:18.023
A promise is
a promise.

06:18.088 --> 06:19.605
I couldn't agree
more.

06:20.638 --> 06:22.019
I couldn't agree
more.

06:24.657 --> 06:26.527
So, anyway,

06:27.025 --> 06:29.332
you haven't missed
much around here.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.066
I'm sorry
to be such a burden.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.648
It's just...
I don't know how to move on.

06:37.713 --> 06:39.770
I've been... going through
incense like crazy.

06:39.846 --> 06:41.204
Oh, poor man.

06:41.281 --> 06:42.551
Here. Eat something.

06:42.616 --> 06:45.207
I know you're a vegetarian,
so I made you tomato soup.

06:45.283 --> 06:46.984
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
That looks pretty good.

06:47.049 --> 06:48.343
You have
any left over for me?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.496
Aw, I threw it out.

06:49.572 --> 06:50.882
I know
that you don't like

06:50.947 --> 06:52.714
things staying around
too long.

06:52.798 --> 06:53.916
Mmm.

06:54.260 --> 06:55.546
She's mad at me.

06:55.822 --> 06:57.929
Her family overstayed
their welcome,

06:57.994 --> 06:59.703
and I turned off
the hot water,

06:59.768 --> 07:00.976
took a few bulbs
out of the room.

07:01.041 --> 07:02.413
You know
how it is when you're married.

07:02.478 --> 07:04.085
Dede and I
never had a cross word.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.182
What?

07:05.260 --> 07:06.683
That is not possible.

07:06.838 --> 07:08.492
Yep.
If things ever got heated,

07:08.557 --> 07:09.793
I'd come up behind her,

07:09.947 --> 07:11.391
put my hands
on her neck...

07:11.456 --> 07:12.668
I'm with you so far.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.949
Then massage her and
tell her she was right.

07:15.072 --> 07:16.871
But what
if she wasn't right?

07:17.580 --> 07:19.066
That's ego talking.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.538
In Buddhism, we believe

07:20.603 --> 07:21.859
it's better to conquer
yourself

07:21.924 --> 07:23.152
than win
a thousand battles.

07:23.228 --> 07:25.968
That's why Nepal is always
crushing it at the Olympics.

07:26.033 --> 07:28.054
Jay, an enlightened man
would go over there

07:28.119 --> 07:30.328
and say, "Gloria,
I love and respect you,

07:30.393 --> 07:32.281
"so of course I love
and respect your family.

07:32.346 --> 07:33.832
I am sorry."

07:33.916 --> 07:35.148
But it was all her fault.

07:35.213 --> 07:37.406
She wouldn't admit it,
but she told me

07:37.471 --> 07:40.367
one person was staying
with us for one day.

07:40.432 --> 07:43.878
That's her text,
but what was her subtext?

07:44.820 --> 07:46.328
Jerry, you're a genius.

07:46.517 --> 07:48.293
She sent me a text.

07:48.455 --> 07:49.571
I have the proof.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.501
Gloria?

07:50.589 --> 07:52.496
- What?
- Right here.

07:52.790 --> 07:54.429
You don't have
to walk over here.

07:54.494 --> 07:56.972
I can read your giant
font from across the room.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.288
"Jay, don't call the police
when you come home.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.366
"It's my cousin.

08:00.431 --> 08:02.977
He's staying with us
for one day."

08:03.341 --> 08:04.699
Let me see.

08:13.298 --> 08:15.691
Walk me through that
Buddhist nonsense again.

08:15.845 --> 08:17.328
Whoo-hoo!

08:17.673 --> 08:20.570
Fun, huh?
Feel that wind and smell that air.

08:20.635 --> 08:22.203
Yeah, it's so bumpy.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.944
Sports suspension.
Nothing between me and the road

08:25.009 --> 08:26.500
except my knuckle-less gloves.

08:26.577 --> 08:27.913
Why do you
even have those?

08:27.978 --> 08:29.053
Oh, a quirk of the Dunphys.

08:29.118 --> 08:30.874
My fingers get cold,
but my knuckles get hot.

08:30.939 --> 08:32.855
- Ah.
- Check it out!

08:33.018 --> 08:34.710
There's an 8-track player.
I love it.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.043
Let's crank something.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.659
Never heard of this band...
Head Cleaner.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.183
Yeah, why don't we just
listen to whatever's in there?

08:42.525 --> 08:44.051
Oh, my God.

08:44.205 --> 08:47.019
- Oh, this takes me back.
- Yeah, I love it.

08:47.525 --> 08:50.339

09:01.083 --> 09:02.784
You're smiling.
You love the car.

09:02.849 --> 09:04.572
Ah, I just remembered
something.

09:04.637 --> 09:05.662
What? Tell me.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.487
It's a...
It's a thing from high school.

09:07.552 --> 09:09.643
Come on.
There are no secrets on the open road.

09:09.708 --> 09:12.967
I just remembered that
I lost my virginity in this car.

09:13.138 --> 09:14.332
What's that now?

09:14.397 --> 09:17.460
Yeah, my boyfriend
snuck the car out at night

09:17.536 --> 09:19.881
and then, you know...
♪ He found the doorway ♪

09:22.116 --> 09:23.834
Oh, my knuckles are

09:23.980 --> 09:25.213
This isn't bothering you,
is it, Phil?

09:25.278 --> 09:26.562
I mean,
you told me about your first time.

09:26.627 --> 09:28.938
I told you about that to
explain why I hate bees so much.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.406
Let's just not talk about
this anymore.

09:30.471 --> 09:31.497
Okay.

09:31.575 --> 09:35.043
<i>♪ Born to be wild ♪</i>

09:35.192 --> 09:37.253
This is the song that was playing,
isn't it?

09:37.318 --> 09:38.496
It's one of them.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.847
I'm gonna fix lunch.
Want some?

09:43.002 --> 09:44.164
You're eating lunch?

09:44.229 --> 09:46.133
Is there some new Internet
challenge I'm not aware of?

09:46.198 --> 09:48.274
And why is your doll
in bandages?

09:48.339 --> 09:50.832
You know me.
I always loved playing doctor.

09:51.103 --> 09:53.024
The truth is,
I accidentally ran her over

09:53.089 --> 09:54.117
and ripped
her arm off,

09:54.182 --> 09:56.344
which might have been fine
if that was the only

09:56.409 --> 09:58.395
baby-mangling issue
I had today.

10:02.498 --> 10:03.555
Oh, my God!

10:03.764 --> 10:04.886
Oh, uh, uh...

10:04.951 --> 10:06.266
Oh, my God.

10:07.881 --> 10:09.591
I'm not cut out
to be a mother.

10:09.656 --> 10:12.797
Then again, a real baby
is easier than a doll, right?

10:12.893 --> 10:16.019
Like,
a real baby would let you know

10:16.096 --> 10:18.250
if it was on fire.

10:19.358 --> 10:21.875
Oh, God,
why are you crying?

10:21.952 --> 10:24.368
Did you just win the
weirdest beauty pageant ever?

10:24.514 --> 10:25.683
Promises kept, Mitchell...

10:25.748 --> 10:27.379
180 months of roses,

10:27.444 --> 10:30.246
and I just watched the
most beautiful love story

10:30.311 --> 10:32.528
between boy and alien.

10:32.593 --> 10:35.567
Why can't the world have
the hearts of children?

10:35.632 --> 10:36.965
Uh-huh.

10:37.607 --> 10:39.981
You know, I think the thing
that touched me the most was how

10:40.046 --> 10:41.420
we were really rooting

10:41.485 --> 10:44.184
for E.T.
to find his way home.

10:44.249 --> 10:46.919
I bet you were pretty thrilled
to stumble upon that coincidence.

10:46.984 --> 10:48.364
- I didn't hate it.
- Anyway,

10:48.429 --> 10:50.746
I'm all caught up
in the promises department.

10:50.811 --> 10:52.121
- Your serve.
- Cam, I just

10:52.186 --> 10:53.626
started
at the D.A.'s office.

10:53.691 --> 10:55.516
I... I can't move
anytime soon.

10:55.671 --> 10:57.211
Plus, what about
Lily's school?

10:57.327 --> 10:58.903
They have schools
in Grasshopper.

10:58.968 --> 10:59.999
Do they?

11:00.084 --> 11:02.028
Plus, Lily has
so many friends here.

11:02.093 --> 11:03.098
Does she?

11:03.176 --> 11:04.676
Did I hear my name?

11:04.741 --> 11:06.934
What are you two
yentas gabbing about?

11:06.999 --> 11:08.535
We were just talking
about moving to

11:08.600 --> 11:09.864
Grandma and Grandpa's farm

11:09.941 --> 11:11.860
in... in the heart of
Tornado Alley.

11:11.929 --> 11:13.457
Oh, God. Cam... Cam.

11:13.522 --> 11:15.004
Look, she's clearly terrified.

11:15.069 --> 11:17.489
Yeah, well, don't worry, sweetie,
because it's already been determined.

11:17.554 --> 11:18.934
We're staying here
forever,

11:18.999 --> 11:22.875
because other daddy is planting
dead Nana in the backyard.

11:22.952 --> 11:23.999
I'm out.

11:24.077 --> 11:25.840
Okay, it was
my mother's last wish

11:25.905 --> 11:28.098
that one of us take her,
and Claire doesn't want her.

11:28.163 --> 11:30.106
- What do you want me to do?
- Well, what do you want me to do?

11:30.171 --> 11:32.250
The farm has been in my
family for 100 years.

11:32.366 --> 11:34.004
You know, I'm next in line,
and you know Daddy.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.586
H-He's slowing down.

11:35.718 --> 11:37.645
Your mother just
sent us a video of him

11:37.710 --> 11:39.231
winning a log-rolling contest.

11:39.296 --> 11:42.364
Only in his age group,
and he was so spent the next day,

11:42.429 --> 11:43.910
he slept through his
first rooster crow

11:43.975 --> 11:45.684
and his snooze rooster crow.

11:45.749 --> 11:47.285
Just admit it...
you have no intention

11:47.350 --> 11:48.996
of keeping your promise
of moving to Missouri.

11:49.061 --> 11:50.207
You know what? You're right.

11:50.272 --> 11:53.570
I... I can't ever imagine myself
living on that farm. I'm sorry.

11:53.635 --> 11:54.660
Well, there it is.

11:56.185 --> 11:58.637
I'm just glad E.T. didn't
land at your house.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.929
Okay, don't give me
that look.

12:02.994 --> 12:04.406
You'll get to go back
to Missouri

12:04.471 --> 12:05.828
when your mom
gets released from pris...

12:05.893 --> 12:07.277
uh, princess camp.

12:07.432 --> 12:09.730
You're really hitting the
gum pretty hard, aren't you?

12:09.822 --> 12:12.328
How do I do this?
Do I... Do I just push down?

12:12.393 --> 12:13.442
I don't know.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.224
Nope.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.520
I got off to a slow start,

12:17.585 --> 12:19.226
but eventually I...
I found my rhythm.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.078
And... And once I broke
that sprinkler line,

12:21.143 --> 12:23.109
the... the water
did most of the digging for me.

12:23.174 --> 12:26.433
All right, let's go.
Just one last pull.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.757
Ah! Ah, okay, that's my ankle.

12:28.822 --> 12:30.114
I'm stuck.

12:30.268 --> 12:32.640
Cal, so, what I'm gonna
need you to do

12:32.705 --> 12:35.532
is go insi...
Cal. Cal!

12:38.859 --> 12:40.148
What? What is it, boy?

12:40.979 --> 12:42.072
Mitchell?

12:42.150 --> 12:43.226
H-He's in trouble?

12:43.291 --> 12:45.293
Trapped in a hole?
Show me.

12:48.565 --> 12:50.890
- Oh, my God, you're cheating.
- No.

12:50.955 --> 12:52.492
You're looking at ways
to solve the puzzle.

12:52.557 --> 12:54.699
How'd you do it,
you pea-brain?

12:55.036 --> 12:56.322
Aah!

12:57.294 --> 12:58.718
What is wrong with me?

12:58.798 --> 13:00.511
Maybe
Dr. Johnson is right.

13:00.576 --> 13:02.746
Maybe I don't have what
it takes to live on Mars.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.308
Stop! Stop.

13:05.604 --> 13:06.746
It's not you.

13:06.947 --> 13:08.250
After I solved the puzzle,

13:08.315 --> 13:09.812
I wanted to make sure
you couldn't,

13:09.877 --> 13:11.515
so I broke a few pieces,

13:11.580 --> 13:12.720
glued some others together.

13:12.785 --> 13:13.903
It can't be solved.

13:14.515 --> 13:16.914
I've had nightmares
over that puzzle!

13:16.979 --> 13:18.723
I cried about it in therapy!

13:18.788 --> 13:19.757
Stop! Not the hair!

13:19.822 --> 13:22.226
- You're gonna fizz it.
- Hey, what the hell? Break it up.

13:22.291 --> 13:23.546
Luke's not playing fair.

13:23.611 --> 13:25.255
Yeah, well,
you make him feel dumb,

13:25.320 --> 13:26.724
and he acts like
it doesn't bother him,

13:26.789 --> 13:28.501
but it does.
And, Luke,

13:28.682 --> 13:30.914
you know better than to mess
with someone so uptight.

13:30.979 --> 13:32.289
What do we always say?

13:32.354 --> 13:34.511
Don't break Alex.
She's our safety net.

13:34.643 --> 13:36.308
Now, you both need
to calm down.

13:36.385 --> 13:37.642
Luke, walk it off.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.039
Oh, no.

13:40.133 --> 13:41.041
Where's Lulu?

13:41.106 --> 13:42.336
Wh... Huh?

13:42.575 --> 13:43.969
The doll?

13:44.047 --> 13:45.618
Who cares?

13:49.984 --> 13:51.861
Haley, what's going on
with you today?

13:51.926 --> 13:53.173
Are you okay?

13:53.820 --> 13:55.220
Okay, um...

13:55.368 --> 13:58.427
So, no one else knows,
especially Mom and Dad,

13:58.601 --> 14:00.939
so you can't tell anybody, but...

14:02.445 --> 14:03.735
I'm pregnant.

14:03.815 --> 14:05.201
You're pregnant?

14:05.266 --> 14:06.634
Damn it, Luke!

14:08.828 --> 14:10.070
Wow.

14:10.226 --> 14:12.591
Guys, don't look at me
like that, okay?

14:12.656 --> 14:15.923
You must think I'm some
irresponsible idiot, don't you?

14:16.055 --> 14:19.416
Um, uh, it's a... Wow, that's...

14:19.578 --> 14:21.447
You got... That's a lot to process.

14:21.531 --> 14:23.034
I...

14:23.422 --> 14:25.162
D-Do you know
who's the...

14:25.227 --> 14:26.353
It's Dylan's.

14:26.424 --> 14:27.982
Oh. What a joyous...

14:28.047 --> 14:29.167
Oh, save it.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.896
He's been great,
actually.

14:30.961 --> 14:33.595
I'm the disaster.
I mean, look at Lulu.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.447
I'm gonna
be a horrible mother.

14:36.766 --> 14:39.611
Okay, first, it's just a doll.

14:40.891 --> 14:43.767
And you've been taking
care of us our whole lives.

14:43.867 --> 14:47.052
Yeah. Remember
how you used to pick out

14:47.117 --> 14:49.544
my first day of school outfit
so I wouldn't get beat up?

14:49.609 --> 14:53.259
Or how you'd hold the book while
I read myself a bedtime story?

14:53.390 --> 14:54.791
And you're still doing it.

14:54.891 --> 14:56.150
You just swooped in
and handled

14:56.215 --> 14:57.900
our fight like a pro.

14:58.187 --> 14:59.583
And you're understanding

14:59.648 --> 15:01.884
and loving
and a total badass.

15:02.016 --> 15:03.189
She's right.

15:03.328 --> 15:05.501
You're the kind of person
that can patch things up

15:05.586 --> 15:08.169
if, say,
Alex ever found out

15:08.234 --> 15:10.603
that I re-arranged the
stickers on her Rubik's Cube.

15:10.734 --> 15:12.525
You son of a...

15:12.937 --> 15:15.439
Aah! Hair, hair!
Haley, help!

15:16.719 --> 15:19.138
Oh. Well, I'm smiling,

15:19.203 --> 15:21.044
so I guess we're keeping the car.

15:21.109 --> 15:22.642
No, you know what?
You're right.

15:22.726 --> 15:25.166
It's not safe,
and it's just gonna take up space.

15:25.632 --> 15:27.656
Honey, did I say
something wrong?

15:27.725 --> 15:28.794
Are you feeling bad?

15:28.859 --> 15:30.576
Well, I-I guess
if I'm being honest,

15:30.641 --> 15:32.755
I'm a-a little worried that
every time I get in the car,

15:32.820 --> 15:34.572
I'll picture you and, uh...

15:34.906 --> 15:35.918
Todd.

15:35.996 --> 15:37.240
- Todd?
- Todd.

15:37.305 --> 15:38.755
Todd was the name of my bully.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.228
It's getting realer.

15:40.358 --> 15:41.560
I mean,
how would you feel

15:41.625 --> 15:44.622
about driving around in the
sweet ride I lost my virginity in?

15:44.687 --> 15:46.341
Do you really think
you can track down

15:46.406 --> 15:48.169
the ox cart from the
Renaissance fair?

15:48.234 --> 15:50.826
I only got to second
base in the ox cart.

15:50.891 --> 15:53.435
If it makes you uncomfortable,
we can sell the car.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.197
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:55.377 --> 15:56.531
Thank you.

15:56.617 --> 15:58.458
But for what it's worth,

15:58.523 --> 16:01.576
I don't want to keep it because
I had so much great sex in it.

16:01.641 --> 16:03.427
- So much?
- No, it's because of

16:03.492 --> 16:05.118
what happened
the next day.

16:05.273 --> 16:08.849
My mom, ugh,
she found the condom wrapper

16:08.914 --> 16:12.619
under the seat,
and it must have freaked her out.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.837
But instead of shaming me

16:16.094 --> 16:17.840
or...
or embarrassing me

16:17.905 --> 16:20.720
with some long,
awful lecture,

16:21.297 --> 16:23.166
she was cool.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.919
She wanted
to make sure that

16:24.984 --> 16:26.318
I was okay with everything

16:26.383 --> 16:28.865
and... that it had all
been a good experience.

16:28.930 --> 16:30.161
But...

16:31.224 --> 16:32.966
Wow.

16:33.187 --> 16:36.220
That must be why
she wanted me to have the car.

16:36.305 --> 16:39.416
That talk meant as much
to my mom as it did to me.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.044
That's incredibly sweet,

16:42.109 --> 16:44.801
and, if it means that much to you,
you should keep it.

16:44.885 --> 16:47.119
But I doubt I'll ever
feel comfortable in it.

16:47.955 --> 16:49.658
We can fix that.

16:53.370 --> 16:55.330
I like where this is going.

16:55.570 --> 16:58.286
I'm gonna make you the best
sex I ever had in this car.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.282
That's a lot of pressure.
Let's aim for top three.

17:00.347 --> 17:01.372
Mm.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.400
Gloria.
I have something to say.

17:08.711 --> 17:10.747
My approach cost me a phone and

17:10.811 --> 17:12.548
a second visit from the plumber,

17:12.625 --> 17:15.098
so I decided to try
Jerry's advice

17:15.164 --> 17:18.439
and give Gloria a heartfelt,
sincere apology.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.380
How hard could
that be to fake?

17:20.444 --> 17:22.959
I was wrong
to chase off your cousins.

17:23.866 --> 17:26.228
I'm sorry that
I didn't...

17:26.664 --> 17:29.158
take your feelings
into consideration.

17:29.703 --> 17:32.501
You deserve to be
respected.

17:33.031 --> 17:35.275
What I should've said
was I love you,

17:35.640 --> 17:37.212
so I love your family.

17:37.461 --> 17:40.185
Please forgive me
for my rude behavior.

17:40.250 --> 17:43.533
Jay, this is all
I ever wanted.

17:43.998 --> 17:47.423
For you to come to me like this,
it means the world to me.

17:47.594 --> 17:48.664
I'm sorry.

17:48.742 --> 17:51.619
I should've been more forward
about my cousin's visit.

17:51.726 --> 17:55.262
And I was wrong for
crushing your cellphone.

17:55.327 --> 17:56.794
Can you ever
forgive me?

17:56.859 --> 17:59.177
Well, it may take a little while, but
sure,

17:59.242 --> 18:00.380
I guess I can.

18:00.445 --> 18:01.747
You know
what I'm going to do?

18:01.812 --> 18:05.001
I'm gonna go to that
butcher shop that you like.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.646
And, if Jerry doesn't mind,

18:08.711 --> 18:11.552
I'm gonna buy you
a beautiful steak for dinner.

18:11.617 --> 18:13.404
Hey, it's your house.
You do what's best for you.

18:13.469 --> 18:15.193
Come to my house,
I'm going to be nude.

18:15.258 --> 18:17.212
We're never going to go
to your house, Jerry.

18:17.351 --> 18:18.775
Did you hear that, Stella?

18:18.954 --> 18:20.294
We're gonna have a steak.

18:20.359 --> 18:21.513
Jerry, you're a genius.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.247
- This is life-changing.
- What did I tell you?

18:23.312 --> 18:24.893
I wish I had tried this
years ago.

18:24.973 --> 18:27.986
This would've made my life
with Dede downright tolerable.

18:28.051 --> 18:29.086
Who knows?

18:29.164 --> 18:30.615
Maybe we even
could've been happy.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.701
I'm glad you think so.

18:31.766 --> 18:33.888
But I'm not the one
you need to tell.

18:34.172 --> 18:37.617
Hey, Dede, it's me, Jay.
Just wondering how you're doing.

18:37.696 --> 18:38.812
Dad?

18:38.898 --> 18:40.732
Uh, it's Saturday here.

18:40.797 --> 18:42.306
You're not leaving
a voicemail.

18:42.597 --> 18:43.821
- From the heart.
- Yeah.

18:43.886 --> 18:46.146
What I wanted to say... is

18:46.211 --> 18:49.450
I... could've handled a lot of
things better in our relationship.

18:49.530 --> 18:50.610
Mm.

18:50.688 --> 18:52.381
I guess
I wasn't a very good partner.

18:52.446 --> 18:53.521
I dug in a lot.

18:53.586 --> 18:56.290
I never thought of things
from your point of view.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.267
I guess I always needed
to get my own way.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.283
Anyway, you were a good woman,

19:01.383 --> 19:02.971
and we had some fun times,

19:03.063 --> 19:04.564
especially in the sack.

19:04.717 --> 19:06.435
Never had a problem there.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.227
Careful.
That's my wife you're talking to.

19:08.306 --> 19:10.252
- Oh, sorry, Jerr, yeah.
- Okay.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.920
I hope you grow up into a nice,
big tree,

19:12.985 --> 19:15.068
a-and I hope you don't
get any of those beetles

19:15.133 --> 19:16.162
that are killing everything.

19:16.227 --> 19:18.052
And when you settle
in in a little while,

19:18.117 --> 19:20.322
maybe I'll bring Joe over
and he can climb you.

19:21.157 --> 19:22.674
- Mm.
- Amen.

19:23.438 --> 19:24.508
You done?

19:24.627 --> 19:25.834
Yeah, I think so.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.420
Mind if I say a word?

19:27.485 --> 19:29.055
She's all yours.

19:29.414 --> 19:30.994
Jay was a big man.

19:31.391 --> 19:33.182
He apologized to his wife.

19:33.615 --> 19:35.244
And do you know
what she did?

19:35.564 --> 19:37.533
She apologized back!

19:37.867 --> 19:39.994
Did you ever do that
even once?!

19:40.086 --> 19:43.775
I apologized to you a thousand times,
and you let me just eat it.

19:43.977 --> 19:46.006
Well, I'm tired of telling
you you're always right,

19:46.071 --> 19:47.115
'cause guess what?

19:47.180 --> 19:49.563
That dolphin
did not recognize you.

19:49.628 --> 19:51.389
Your haikus had
too many syllables.

19:51.468 --> 19:54.236
And trust me, vegans
do need deodorant!

19:54.352 --> 19:56.369
All right. Come on.

19:56.907 --> 19:58.671
Come on, kid.
Let me buy you a nice steak.

19:58.736 --> 19:59.906
Yeah.

20:00.078 --> 20:01.692
Hey. Here.

20:01.762 --> 20:03.216
I-I want you
to eat something.

20:03.281 --> 20:04.318
Be careful.

20:04.383 --> 20:06.255
Thank you for taking
such good care of me,

20:06.320 --> 20:07.398
even when you're mad.

20:07.463 --> 20:09.607
No. My gosh,
I am not mad.

20:09.734 --> 20:11.045
And I shouldn't have
pushed.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.341
I-I'm sorry, but, you know,
if we learn one thing today,

20:14.406 --> 20:17.216
it's that you couldn't
survive on a farm.

20:17.281 --> 20:18.674
I'll be fine,

20:18.813 --> 20:21.196
- because I'll be with you.
- What?

20:21.409 --> 20:24.374
I guess w-when I look at
things from your point of view,

20:24.539 --> 20:26.369
I... I made a promise.

20:26.670 --> 20:29.154
When your dad needs you
to take over the farm,

20:29.313 --> 20:30.555
I'm in.

20:30.819 --> 20:33.065
Mitchell, that means
so much to me,

20:33.263 --> 20:34.658
and you're gonna love it.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.857
The fresh air,
and there's no traffic.

20:36.922 --> 20:40.023
Oh, and with a second lawyer in town,
we could reopen the courthouse.

20:40.441 --> 20:42.024
H-Have you ever milked a goat?

20:42.089 --> 20:44.402
Have you ever had fresh
milk right from the spigot?

20:44.467 --> 20:45.841
Oh, unbelievable.

20:45.906 --> 20:47.679
You do have to be careful
of snakes and mice and rats.

20:47.744 --> 20:49.772
There's a ton of field mice.

20:49.837 --> 20:52.642
They scare me. One ran up my
sleeve one time when I was a kid.

20:54.345 --> 20:57.478
This car is smaller than I remember.
I think I'm just less flexible?

20:57.593 --> 20:59.978
- I think I threw out my lap.
- Oh.

21:00.064 --> 21:02.380
We were, um,
just cleaning out the garage.

21:02.445 --> 21:03.981
Mm, nice try.
We heard everything.

21:04.046 --> 21:05.646
Yeah, although
around the finish line,

21:05.711 --> 21:07.459
we kind of lost track of
who was who.

21:07.524 --> 21:10.743
I can't believe Mom caught you
having sex in her car again.

21:10.945 --> 21:13.427
You're calling the tree Mom?
Okay.

21:13.492 --> 21:15.251
So, listen,
after some reflection,

21:15.373 --> 21:17.243
we decided that she
might be better off here.

21:17.390 --> 21:18.486
Now, before you say no...

21:18.551 --> 21:20.150
I'd actually really like that.

21:20.253 --> 21:21.429
Hey!

21:21.507 --> 21:23.270
What was all that
screeching in the garage?

21:23.335 --> 21:24.435
Are the raccoons back?

21:24.500 --> 21:25.666
Damn it!
