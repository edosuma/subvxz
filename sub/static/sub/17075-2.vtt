WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.209
To our first real date.

00:02.212 --> 00:04.978
To my first, first date in 18 years.

00:04.981 --> 00:07.715
Oh! 18 years! Well, the pressure is on.

00:10.750 --> 00:12.490
It's not a great chugging alcohol.

00:12.493 --> 00:14.154
That is tannic. Yeah.

00:14.157 --> 00:17.190
Well, I just feel like the
luckiest man in the world.

00:17.193 --> 00:18.714
I'm on a date with a wonderful woman,

00:18.717 --> 00:20.493
and I have a new bestie.

00:20.496 --> 00:22.729
Who is my almost-ex-husband.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.524
Who doesn't know we're dating.

00:24.527 --> 00:26.499
You know, eventually, we will tell Pat.

00:26.502 --> 00:29.235
We have a long way to go before
we know if this is a real thing.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.471
Yeah. I mean, I want to make
sure he and I are solid

00:31.474 --> 00:33.473
before I put that stress
on the relationship.

00:33.476 --> 00:35.736
Oh, my God! He's here!

00:35.739 --> 00:36.626
What?!

00:36.629 --> 00:39.779
Don't look behind you. Pat is here.

00:39.782 --> 00:40.895
What? Why? Why is he here?

00:40.898 --> 00:42.048
He doesn't know about this restaurant.

00:42.051 --> 00:43.047
I told him about it.

00:43.050 --> 00:44.565
I can't stop talking
about the bruschetta.

00:44.589 --> 00:45.491
Is he looking over here?

00:45.515 --> 00:46.843
No. He's picking up a to-go order.

00:46.846 --> 00:48.545
Oh, God. I hope he got the bruschetta.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.900
Of course, he did. He eats
anything anybody says is good.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.523
Well, here I am again.

00:56.526 --> 00:59.559
Another day of being gay,
in theory, and not in practice,

00:59.562 --> 01:01.661
unlike my siblings,
who are getting more action

01:01.664 --> 01:03.596
on their devices than
I've gotten all year.

01:03.599 --> 01:07.867
Oh, man! I love dating a college girl!

01:07.870 --> 01:10.703
Lacey's at a party, and I think
she's getting a little tipsy.

01:10.706 --> 01:12.639
So you two might want to clear the couch,

01:12.642 --> 01:14.941
'cause I sense this texting
is about to get steamy.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.310
With or without us on this couch,

01:17.313 --> 01:19.634
please never get steamy on it.

01:19.659 --> 01:23.516
Too late by 6 years.

01:25.254 --> 01:27.387
It's cute how you think
the blanket's safe.

01:27.390 --> 01:29.967
That blanket probably has more
stories to tell than I do.

01:29.992 --> 01:33.426
Ah, Ethan thinks it's adorable
to steal my healing potion.

01:33.429 --> 01:35.595
Well, I'm going to decapitate him.

01:35.598 --> 01:37.466
Oh, look at his cute, little head.

01:37.491 --> 01:38.482
I'm gonna kick it.

01:38.507 --> 01:40.733
All right, you guys get off
your screens and talk to me!

01:40.736 --> 01:42.402
Is there something wrong with me?

01:42.405 --> 01:44.504
I mean, I feel like my bangs
are at their best angle ever,

01:44.507 --> 01:47.118
I found a deodorant that works
with my active lifestyle.

01:47.143 --> 01:48.908
I mean, is it me? Just be honest.

01:48.911 --> 01:50.729
Well, sometimes you do go on without

01:50.754 --> 01:52.045
- really hearing...
- I mean, am I even gay

01:52.048 --> 01:53.746
if I'm just sitting on
the couch with you two?

01:53.749 --> 01:56.561
If a gay falls in the forest,
and there's not another gay to say,

01:56.586 --> 01:59.419
"Hey, girl, you okay?" did he even fall?

01:59.422 --> 02:01.521
The problem is that I'm completely alone

02:01.524 --> 02:03.223
in a forest of straight people.

02:03.226 --> 02:06.226
I need one where more gay guys
come to gather nuts and berries.

02:06.229 --> 02:09.929
Come on, Kenny. You know how
to find a more crowded forest.

02:09.931 --> 02:12.599
- Dating apps.
- Mm-hmm.

02:12.602 --> 02:14.100
Okay. I'll set up an account,

02:14.103 --> 02:15.535
but it seems like most gays

02:15.538 --> 02:17.470
don't use their faces in their profiles,

02:17.473 --> 02:18.771
just their best body feature.

02:18.774 --> 02:19.939
What's my best body feature?

02:19.942 --> 02:20.907
Your calves.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.942
Really? Not my biceps?

02:22.945 --> 02:25.745
Please show me where you
think your biceps are located.

02:25.748 --> 02:27.614
Okay. My calves.

02:27.617 --> 02:29.415
They're the most manly part of your body.

02:29.418 --> 02:30.550
It's like your upper half

02:30.553 --> 02:32.585
didn't tell your lower half you're gay.

02:32.588 --> 02:35.922
Mm. Okay. Here we go.

02:35.947 --> 02:40.193
I am stepping, calf-first,
into a whole new forest.

02:40.218 --> 02:41.625
Kenny, take your foot off the table.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.360
Excuse me.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.128
Where are you coming from
in your New Year's cardigan?

02:45.131 --> 02:47.264
I was having a drink with friends.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.632
You don't drink.

02:48.635 --> 02:49.633
You don't have friends.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.602
Well, okay, then. You caught me.

02:52.605 --> 02:56.206
I was measuring the hedges

02:56.209 --> 02:57.741
to make sure they're height-appropriate.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.842
That sounds about right.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.110
- Yep.
- There we go.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.682
Hi. How did the date with VP Murray go?

03:05.685 --> 03:08.051
Wait. I want to sit. No, I'll stand.

03:08.054 --> 03:08.806
I'll take a knee.

03:08.831 --> 03:10.954
Stop moving. It went great...

03:10.957 --> 03:13.457
after we crawled out from
under the restaurant table.

03:13.460 --> 03:17.527
Oh. It went that kind of great.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.163
I fooled around under the
bleachers with a mascot once,

03:20.166 --> 03:22.299
head still on, thank you very much.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.167
No. We were hiding.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.836
Pat came in.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.838
I still haven't told him
I'm seeing Clive yet.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.140
- Why not?
- He's so sensitive.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.209
He cried through "The Hangover 3."

03:32.212 --> 03:33.723
I'm afraid this would crush him.

03:33.748 --> 03:35.412
So, before I tell him,

03:35.415 --> 03:37.400
I'm going to soften him up first,

03:37.425 --> 03:39.749
with his favorite breakfast.

03:39.752 --> 03:42.586
Morning.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.688
Do I smell sausages
from the 99 cent store?

03:44.691 --> 03:46.556
Covered in jelly, like you like them.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.725
Come on over here, sleepy head.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.027
Hey, is that a new flannel?

03:51.030 --> 03:53.396
Oh, well, yeah, but it's exactly
like the one I replaced.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.098
I love how you do that.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.434
Here.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.803
- It's for me?
- Mm-hmm.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.972
Wow! Thank you.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.441
Well, the Bears game's
about to start, so...

04:04.444 --> 04:05.977
Oh, don't go down there to watch it.

04:06.002 --> 04:08.345
Watch up here with your
family, above ground.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.981
And I'm giving you Pop-Tarts for lunch.

04:13.786 --> 04:16.319
Kenny! I have a problem!

04:16.322 --> 04:18.154
Lacey hasn't texted me back
since the party last night.

04:18.156 --> 04:20.055
W-W-What do you think happened to her?

04:20.059 --> 04:21.358
You think she's dead?!

04:21.361 --> 04:24.060
Not that I want that,
but that would explain things.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.229
I'm sure it's fine.

04:26.232 --> 04:27.864
My app!

04:27.867 --> 04:30.634
I swiped right on two
cute guys last night.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.168
I wonder which one of them liked me.

04:32.171 --> 04:33.103
What if it's both?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.738
I might need to get a burner phone.

04:34.741 --> 04:38.208
Why did we not lose our virginity to
each other before she went to college?

04:38.211 --> 04:40.034
It seemed like such a good idea, you know,

04:40.059 --> 04:41.011
wait till Thanksgiving,

04:41.014 --> 04:43.245
because everyone knows that if
you make it till Thanksgiving,

04:43.269 --> 04:44.359
you make it forever.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.049
That's not a thing.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.651
Wait. What?

04:47.654 --> 04:48.952
Neither guy picked me.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.488
But, no. I thought I was
a reach for them.

04:51.491 --> 04:52.856
Oh, my God.

04:52.859 --> 04:57.160
You know, I've always considered
myself a 9, but am I a...

04:57.163 --> 04:58.295
An 8?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.096
Hey! Don't you ever say that!

05:00.099 --> 05:02.198
If anybody should be down
on themselves, it's me.

05:02.201 --> 05:05.370
Why did I think Lacey would stay
with a high school kid when...

05:05.395 --> 05:09.072
When she's living in a big
pile of horny college dudes?

05:09.075 --> 05:11.474
They're all just hot and sweaty.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.943
It's like a sausage cauldron.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.211
Mm, no. That's vivid...

05:15.214 --> 05:17.447
and effective.

05:17.450 --> 05:22.619
Jimmy, you need to go
see Lacey at college.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.154
And I'm going to go with you.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.422
You... You would do that for me?

05:25.425 --> 05:26.523
I mean, and myself.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.692
I will prove that I'm at least an 8.5.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.452
I just need a change of venue, you know,

05:30.477 --> 05:32.608
an audience that gets me,
a different forest.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.131
You need gay dudes.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.267
That's... That's what I'm saying.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.569
And you need to go
make a big, romantic gesture,

05:39.572 --> 05:40.704
sweep her off her feet,

05:40.707 --> 05:43.440
make her remember why she loves you.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.910
You are so good at being a straight.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.159
It's such a wasted talent.

05:48.184 --> 05:49.579
It's like you turning gay

05:49.582 --> 05:52.916
was when Jordan went to play baseball.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.585
Jordin Sparks played baseball?

05:57.390 --> 05:59.155
What happened?

05:59.158 --> 06:01.060
Ethan, where did you go?!

06:01.085 --> 06:03.526
Hey, could you keep it down?

06:03.529 --> 06:04.661
You don't live here.

06:04.664 --> 06:09.065
Ooh, somebody's in a mood.

06:09.068 --> 06:11.568
I decapitated Ethan,
and he hasn't regenerated

06:11.571 --> 06:13.737
and he won't answer any of my messages.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.672
Wait. Ethan's a kid you like, right?

06:15.675 --> 06:17.674
Yeah. I thought he liked strong women.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.343
But, like all men,
he wants a lady in the streets

06:20.346 --> 06:21.611
and an orc in the sheets.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.712
Look, call him!

06:22.715 --> 06:24.842
Is that what old people
do with their phones?

06:24.867 --> 06:26.516
Okay, I'm young enough to
know that that was a burn,

06:26.519 --> 06:28.652
but you're clearly upset,
so I'm going to let it slide.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.844
All I'm saying is get off the
screens and interact with him.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.090
Oh, yeah, and why don't we
hook up the horse and buggy

06:34.093 --> 06:36.459
and go to the harvest festival, too?

06:36.484 --> 06:39.463
It's over, Aunt Jodi. I ruined it.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.699
I had a good time, too.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.567
And I was thinking, if it's not too soon,

06:44.570 --> 06:46.670
we could take it up a
notch for our next date...

06:46.673 --> 06:48.938
The Cheesecake Factory.

06:48.941 --> 06:51.441
But their menu is so big.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.443
Well, not too big for a woman like you.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.446
You just ruined it. Bye.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.250
Who's ready for a cold one?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.018
Well, yeah, sure, but I can get it.

07:02.021 --> 07:05.555
You, sit, you. I like bringing you beers.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.157
Thanks.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.559
Um...

07:09.562 --> 07:11.194
why are being so nice today?

07:11.197 --> 07:14.297
What? A man doesn't deserve to
be treated well in his own home?

07:14.300 --> 07:15.765
Matter of fact,
you're looking a little tense.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.700
Would you like a back rub?

07:16.703 --> 07:17.967
Ow. Hey.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.037
Eileen, you haven't touched
me in two years,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.588
not even when I passed out
and needed mouth-to-mouth.

07:23.613 --> 07:24.841
You just blew on me.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.876
Yeah, well, you're alive, aren't you?

07:26.879 --> 07:28.078
Ow.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.818
Ethan. What are you doing here?

07:34.821 --> 07:36.920
Your message said, "Come over, IRL."

07:36.923 --> 07:40.190
That means "in real life." Hi.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.658
Excuse me for a minute.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.330
What did you do?

07:43.354 --> 07:45.126
I lured a 15-year-old boy to the house,

07:45.152 --> 07:46.996
under false pretenses, on the Internet.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.465
And you're bragging about that?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.899
It's a good thing.

07:49.924 --> 07:53.929
Why don't you kids go relax,
and I'll make us some snacks.

07:57.076 --> 07:58.241
Jodi! Jodi!

07:58.244 --> 07:59.844
I need to talk to you
right now! Come on!

08:03.616 --> 08:05.882
Go ahead and sit.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.051
I figured out why Eileen's been
giving me so much attention.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.686
Yes, finally.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.255
Let's talk about this
whole awkward situation.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.758
She wants me back.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.316
What more is there to say?

08:17.458 --> 08:19.370
I know it sounds crazy,
but I am telling you

08:19.395 --> 08:21.690
she has been doing some
really weird things lately,

08:21.715 --> 08:23.587
like, um, touching me.

08:23.612 --> 08:25.993
Huh? And smiling? What?

08:26.018 --> 08:28.134
I mean, Eileen knows that
we're wrong for each other.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.774
She... She's just lonely.

08:30.799 --> 08:34.078
Right. She's lonely because she's alone.

08:34.104 --> 08:35.681
She's not dating anybody.

08:35.706 --> 08:38.196
She's a miserable, shell of a woman.

08:38.221 --> 08:39.494
She'll probably be alone forever.

08:39.518 --> 08:41.794
Unless...

08:41.820 --> 08:43.219
I find her a man.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.054
She doesn't need a man. She's fine.

08:45.057 --> 08:48.066
She's out there,
enjoying her rich, full life.

08:48.091 --> 08:52.595
No. Jodi, you were right.
Eileen just needs a man.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.029
And I'm gonna find her one.

08:54.032 --> 08:57.533
Uuuuuuuuuh...

08:59.605 --> 09:01.223
Okay, what do you think of my bangs?

09:01.248 --> 09:03.873
I took a big swing for college.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.008
Wispy.

09:06.011 --> 09:08.844
Yeah, there's no way Lacey gave
her virginity to anybody else.

09:08.847 --> 09:10.312
You know, I'm gonna go in there,

09:10.315 --> 09:11.575
I'm gonna sweep her off her feet

09:11.599 --> 09:13.349
with my romantic seduction plan,

09:13.352 --> 09:16.819
and then she is going
to imprint all over me.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.220
I'm sorry?

09:18.223 --> 09:20.589
See, you sexually imprint on the
person who takes your virginity

09:20.592 --> 09:22.391
so that you're attracted
to each other forever.

09:22.394 --> 09:25.661
It's like an orphaned, baby duck
who thinks a dog is its mother,

09:25.664 --> 09:27.763
but with sex.

09:27.766 --> 09:29.565
That's not a thing.

09:29.568 --> 09:30.399
Well...

09:31.570 --> 09:33.803
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Pat.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.838
Man, I can't believe
you're here on a weekend.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.406
Oh, well, you know what they say,

09:37.409 --> 09:38.874
"He who burns the midnight oil

09:38.877 --> 09:42.111
lives with his mother and
needs a frickin' minute!"

09:42.114 --> 09:43.879
Ah.

09:43.882 --> 09:45.781
Well, I have something
to talk to you about,

09:45.784 --> 09:47.783
and I thought I should
come and do it in person.

09:47.786 --> 09:52.121
Um, so... Wow.

09:52.124 --> 09:53.589
Being single's hard, huh?

09:53.592 --> 09:55.958
So hard.

09:55.961 --> 10:00.196
It is hard enough to make a man
sometimes make complicated choices.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.231
Yes! That's right.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.900
And, so, I had an idea.

10:06.738 --> 10:07.770
There's so many dudes.

10:07.773 --> 10:08.838
I know.

10:08.841 --> 10:12.641
- This is my nightmare.
- College, baby.

10:12.644 --> 10:13.776
Okay, I think I messed up

10:13.779 --> 10:15.711
going big, romantic instead of big, sexy.

10:15.714 --> 10:19.348
The flowers, candles and Lacey's
favorite fro-yo from Chicago...

10:19.351 --> 10:20.749
That's baby stuff.

10:20.752 --> 10:22.384
I don't want to have sex like a baby.

10:22.387 --> 10:24.186
Yeah, no, I like that as a goal for you.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.097
Nachos are ready,
the universal party-starter

10:35.100 --> 10:36.765
from our neighbors to the south.

10:36.768 --> 10:40.069
By the south, I mean Texas.
Mexicans don't really do nachos.

10:40.072 --> 10:42.004
Learned that lesson the hard way.

10:42.007 --> 10:43.440
Okay.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.279
Want some?

10:50.282 --> 10:51.780
I would, but they look really gross.

10:51.783 --> 10:54.717
Uh, gum?

10:54.742 --> 10:55.866
Sure.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:06.331 --> 11:08.063
I'm gonna jet.

11:10.802 --> 11:13.535
I've done the math.
I've done the measurements.

11:13.538 --> 11:15.604
There couldn't be a more perfect place

11:15.607 --> 11:18.407
filled with guys that are
ready to choose me to be with.

11:18.410 --> 11:21.210
Let the swiping begin.

11:21.213 --> 11:24.380
Hello, everybody,
and welcome to "Swipe Right,"

11:24.383 --> 11:26.749
the hot, new game show
that's swiping the nation.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.617
Kenny O'Neal, are you ready to play?

11:28.620 --> 11:30.552
Born ready. Literally.

11:30.555 --> 11:32.321
Leave the jokes to me, son.

11:32.324 --> 11:33.322
It's all I have.

11:33.325 --> 11:35.624
Now, let's meet our eligible gays.

11:35.627 --> 11:37.059
First is Cory.

11:37.062 --> 11:39.295
Cory enjoys gardening, snow boarding,

11:39.298 --> 11:40.729
and living in the moment.

11:40.732 --> 11:41.997
Next, Diego.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.301
Diego is a fan of spy movies,
train trips, and winter.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.102
Finally, we have Jack.

11:47.105 --> 11:48.537
Jack has a ferret.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.205
All right, Kenny, as you know,

11:50.208 --> 11:51.473
a swipe right is a match,

11:51.476 --> 11:53.709
but a swipe left is a big, fat no.

11:53.712 --> 11:58.013
Okay. You all seem great,
but if I had to choose...

11:58.016 --> 12:00.749
Ooh, I hate being this guy.

12:00.752 --> 12:01.951
Cory, all the way.

12:01.954 --> 12:03.752
I swipe right.

12:03.755 --> 12:06.155
Cory, is it a match?

12:06.158 --> 12:08.557
Oh! Cory thinks you're gross.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.092
Okay, that's fine.

12:10.095 --> 12:11.827
I wasn't sure about him, either.

12:11.830 --> 12:16.065
The one I wasreally interested in,
okay, was Diego.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.567
And, Diego...

12:18.570 --> 12:21.181
swipes left on you,
which leaves us Jack.

12:21.206 --> 12:22.404
I hope you like ferrets, Kenny.

12:22.407 --> 12:24.039
I don't,

12:24.042 --> 12:26.942
but I am willing to look past that.

12:26.945 --> 12:29.511
Jack, what do you say?

12:29.514 --> 12:31.513
Oh! Thanks for playing, Kenny.

12:31.516 --> 12:33.716
Your parting gift is a life alone.

12:34.953 --> 12:36.819
- Hey, you.
- Hey!

12:36.822 --> 12:38.887
I just got done doing your laundry.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.789
You need new undies.

12:40.792 --> 12:43.592
Those elastic waistbands are
just a formality at this point.

12:43.595 --> 12:45.728
Not at all necessary.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.863
Um, so, listen. I need to talk to you.

12:47.866 --> 12:51.066
Oh, thank goodness, because
I need to talk to you, too.

12:51.069 --> 12:54.236
Pat, I hope you know that I
think you are a wonderful man,

12:54.239 --> 12:55.871
really, any woman's dream.

12:55.874 --> 12:57.306
No, Eileen, I'm really not.

12:57.309 --> 12:58.273
Yes, you are.

12:58.276 --> 12:59.942
Eileen, I'm disgusting!

12:59.945 --> 13:02.911
Now, the good news is,
I know someone who isn't.

13:02.914 --> 13:05.738
And, please,
just keep an open mind about this,

13:05.763 --> 13:07.449
because I think you're
gonna really like this idea

13:07.452 --> 13:08.584
if you give it a chance.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.320
What are you talking about?

13:11.323 --> 13:12.688
Come on in.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.427
Hello.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.596
Eileen, I think you know
VP Murray from the school.

13:20.599 --> 13:21.797
Uh-huh.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.965
I brought him here today

13:22.968 --> 13:27.336
because I think the two of
you should go on a date.

13:36.805 --> 13:40.272
You want me to date our kids'
vice principal?

13:40.275 --> 13:41.406
I know. This is crazy!

13:41.409 --> 13:42.981
I said to him, "This is out of left field!"

13:43.005 --> 13:44.287
Why am I screaming?!

13:44.312 --> 13:45.944
Listen, I know it's a little weird,

13:45.947 --> 13:47.488
because we always used to make fun of him

13:47.512 --> 13:48.987
for the, you know, spaghetti legs.

13:49.012 --> 13:50.754
His legs aren't actually
that skinny anymore.

13:50.778 --> 13:52.512
Thank you. My goal is to
go from "spaghetti legs"

13:52.536 --> 13:54.316
to "rigatoni legs" by Christmas.

13:55.465 --> 13:58.532
- Okay. Pat, I don't think...
- Listen. This could work, okay?

13:58.535 --> 14:01.335
And, look, I know
you've been lonely lately,

14:01.338 --> 14:05.138
but, you know, giving me back
rubs is not the way to fix that.

14:05.141 --> 14:06.406
What's that, now, about back rubs?

14:06.409 --> 14:08.809
Come on. Just have
one drink with the guy.

14:08.812 --> 14:10.010
It's no big deal.

14:10.013 --> 14:11.813
Come on. What do you say?

14:15.275 --> 14:16.047
Okay.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.758
Okay! Great!

14:17.783 --> 14:19.594
Eileen, Clive likes backgammon,

14:19.619 --> 14:21.219
British dramas, and a hard cheese.

14:21.244 --> 14:23.111
Clive, Eileen likes...

14:25.261 --> 14:26.927
Ooh.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.962
Wow. I guess it's a good
thing we're getting divorced.

14:31.001 --> 14:33.200
Have fun.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.555
You're not suicidal, are you?

14:39.580 --> 14:41.808
As an R.A., I have a legal
obligation to intervene.

14:41.811 --> 14:44.077
I'm not suicidal. Great.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.345
But I am sad.

14:45.348 --> 14:46.713
Great.

14:46.716 --> 14:48.483
Okay, so, uh, what's your problem?

14:50.553 --> 14:52.886
My problem is that I'm so repulsive

14:52.889 --> 14:55.689
that not even Johnny98
swiped right for me.

14:55.692 --> 14:56.990
And I only pity-swiped him

14:56.993 --> 14:59.159
because I felt that his braided
belt was a cry for help.

14:59.162 --> 15:00.293
I thought college would be

15:00.296 --> 15:01.762
the place for me to spread my gay wings.

15:01.765 --> 15:04.464
Don't say that. That means
something you're not ready for.

15:04.467 --> 15:09.069
But nobody's interested, you know?

15:09.072 --> 15:11.920
I mean, there has to be
something wrong with me!

15:11.945 --> 15:13.043
Okay, slow down.

15:13.068 --> 15:15.201
Just slow down. Just
show me your profile.

15:15.226 --> 15:16.358
It's okay.

15:18.782 --> 15:21.081
Okay, so, first of all,
this is not a picture of you.

15:21.084 --> 15:22.149
This is a picture of a goat leg.

15:22.152 --> 15:24.484
No, it's my leg.

15:24.487 --> 15:26.853
Oh! Well...

15:26.856 --> 15:29.589
it's more human in person,
is the good news.

15:29.592 --> 15:32.559
So you aren't being rejected. A goat is.

15:32.562 --> 15:33.994
Oh.

15:33.997 --> 15:36.163
And guys who put up
random body parts online

15:36.166 --> 15:37.264
are either shame queens

15:37.267 --> 15:39.132
or they don't have a face like yours.

15:39.135 --> 15:40.434
Really?

15:40.437 --> 15:43.437
Well, you're not so bad yourself.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.020
- Don't go there.
- I had to try.

16:03.660 --> 16:06.493
- Doh, Michele!
- Aah! Intruder! Intruder!

16:06.496 --> 16:07.394
Ooh! Ah! Ah!

16:07.397 --> 16:08.628
I'm not an intruder. I'm a friend.

16:08.631 --> 16:10.597
I know all about you. Aah!

16:10.600 --> 16:12.566
Okay, new profile pic is up.

16:12.569 --> 16:14.334
It's of my face, completely hairless.

16:14.337 --> 16:19.005
Please, please, oh, please,
let somebody right-swipe me.

16:19.008 --> 16:20.362
Are you praying?

16:20.387 --> 16:21.441
What? No.

16:21.444 --> 16:24.144
Okay. Kenny, why is
this so important to you?

16:25.415 --> 16:27.080
I just...

16:27.083 --> 16:29.716
Coming out has been really, really tough.

16:29.719 --> 16:33.220
You know, my first date was just bad.

16:33.223 --> 16:34.721
I had a disappointing first kiss,

16:34.724 --> 16:36.990
and the only other gay kid
at my school is a lesbian.

16:36.993 --> 16:39.359
I thought coming here
would give me some hope,

16:39.362 --> 16:41.495
but what if I've gone through all of this

16:41.498 --> 16:43.130
and no guy will ever want me?

16:43.133 --> 16:44.631
Okay, I think you have to...

16:44.634 --> 16:45.999
Oh, my gosh! Somebody right-swiped me!

16:46.002 --> 16:47.567
Somebody 52 feet away
finds me attractive!

16:48.705 --> 16:50.102
Wait. What are you doing?
Give me my phone back!

16:50.126 --> 16:51.104
Oh, I will,

16:51.107 --> 16:53.140
but I want to point out one
thing to you first, okay?

16:53.143 --> 16:54.608
Five seconds ago, you were hopeless,

16:54.611 --> 16:56.543
and now you're giddy because, what,

16:56.546 --> 16:58.445
CoolGuy62 did this with his finger?

16:58.448 --> 16:59.946
Okay, you cannot let your self worth

16:59.949 --> 17:01.515
be based on other people's approval.

17:01.518 --> 17:03.237
What do I base it on?

17:04.654 --> 17:07.354
Okay, fine. I get it.

17:07.357 --> 17:09.189
- Kenny, we gotta go!
- Stop! Stop him!

17:09.192 --> 17:11.124
We gotta go!

17:14.164 --> 17:16.874
Okay, cool. So I gotta go.

17:16.898 --> 17:19.238
Coming!

17:19.262 --> 17:20.962
Now, you guys have a great time.

17:20.964 --> 17:22.997
I want you to stay out
as late as you want,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.531
and, hey, dinner's on me, okay?

17:24.535 --> 17:26.534
- Okay.
- Oh, thanks, buddy, yeah.

17:26.537 --> 17:28.469
- All right, guys.
- Wow.

17:28.472 --> 17:30.371
Can you believe it turned out that way?

17:30.374 --> 17:32.406
No. We totally got away with it.

17:32.409 --> 17:35.309
And Pat likes you, and he's
happy we're together.

17:35.312 --> 17:37.245
It really could not have gone better.

17:37.248 --> 17:39.580
This is, literally,
the first time in my life

17:39.583 --> 17:41.249
that something has worked out.

17:41.252 --> 17:43.918
Oh, this, and the time
I found out it wasn't polio.

17:43.921 --> 17:46.254
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

17:46.257 --> 17:47.722
I think so.

17:47.725 --> 17:49.624
Yeah. We have to tell him the truth.

17:49.627 --> 17:50.925
No, woman! No!

17:50.928 --> 17:54.562
Clive, this is not me. I am not a liar.

17:54.565 --> 17:56.831
Pat and I are trying to build
a post-marriage friendship.

17:56.834 --> 17:59.433
I don't want to ruin it with a lie.

17:59.436 --> 18:00.801
We need to tell him.

18:00.804 --> 18:04.405
Yep. This feels more like my life.

18:04.408 --> 18:08.910
So, before you say anything
about how much I suck,

18:08.913 --> 18:10.111
I want to say I'm sorry.

18:10.114 --> 18:11.946
I gave you real bad advice about Ethan.

18:11.949 --> 18:14.782
When I was your age, the closest
we got to flirting on a screen

18:14.785 --> 18:18.352
was typing 58008 on a calculator.

18:18.355 --> 18:21.322
It spelled out "boobs"
if you turned it upside down.

18:21.325 --> 18:23.591
At the time, it was a revelation.

18:23.594 --> 18:26.394
Well, as much as I didn't like
the surprise of him coming over,

18:26.397 --> 18:28.062
it did move things forward with us.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.363
I saw the whole thing, sweetie.

18:29.366 --> 18:30.998
You do not have to sugar-coat it for me.

18:31.001 --> 18:32.233
Well, what you didn't see

18:32.236 --> 18:34.101
is, when I offered him a piece of gum,

18:34.104 --> 18:36.371
he took the pack and then
gave me back the piece.

18:36.396 --> 18:38.039
So, he's greedy.

18:38.042 --> 18:40.508
No, he was flustered.

18:40.511 --> 18:41.976
And that means he likes me.

18:41.979 --> 18:45.580
I knew it! Boobs, yes!

18:45.583 --> 18:46.914
That never would have happened

18:46.917 --> 18:48.549
if we we hadn't been in the same room,

18:48.552 --> 18:50.184
so, thank you.

18:51.355 --> 18:54.789
See, he's back in the
game. He regenerated.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.358
And he killed me.

18:57.361 --> 18:59.927
He's dragging my corpse
through the street.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.663
He seems like a keeper.

19:02.666 --> 19:03.998
All summer?

19:04.001 --> 19:06.167
In the meat aisle, Eileen?

19:06.170 --> 19:07.168
With him?

19:07.171 --> 19:08.269
You picked him, too.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.338
Well, yeah, because he's not a threat.

19:10.341 --> 19:12.807
I mean, it's like you're
dating a pair of khakis.

19:12.810 --> 19:14.381
That's a durable and versatile pant.

19:14.406 --> 19:18.879
Wait a minute. So, our picnic
was really your picnic?

19:18.882 --> 19:20.047
Initially...

19:20.050 --> 19:22.984
...yes, but it became ours,

19:22.987 --> 19:25.019
and ours it shall always be.

19:25.022 --> 19:27.955
Unbelievable. No wonder
you were rubbing my back.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.490
Hey, there's that back rub thing again.

19:29.493 --> 19:31.192
Look, you know what? I'm sorry.

19:31.195 --> 19:34.262
We spent so much of our marriage
not talking about things,

19:34.265 --> 19:36.097
and I want us to be
honest with each other

19:36.100 --> 19:37.632
now that we're getting a divorce.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.600
And...

19:38.736 --> 19:40.167
I should have told you.

19:40.170 --> 19:41.402
Yes, you should have.

19:41.405 --> 19:44.305
But the person I'm
really upset with is you,

19:44.308 --> 19:46.340
making out with my ex.

19:46.343 --> 19:47.541
I thought we were friends.

19:47.544 --> 19:49.443
We were. We are.

19:49.446 --> 19:52.847
I have needed us so bad, for so long.

19:52.850 --> 19:54.448
Eileen means nothing to me.

19:54.451 --> 19:55.816
Okay, now.

19:55.819 --> 19:56.852
Don't go.

19:58.856 --> 20:00.388
Please.

20:00.391 --> 20:01.922
Give me another chance.

20:01.925 --> 20:04.959
I don't know.

20:04.962 --> 20:06.961
I need some time.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.467
We could still go to The
Cheesecake Factory.

20:13.470 --> 20:14.602
Eileen,

20:14.605 --> 20:17.639
The Cheesecake Factory
is for celebrations!

20:20.526 --> 20:22.050
Well, they never even got my name,

20:22.075 --> 20:24.347
so maybe Lacey won't even
know it was me, right?

20:25.497 --> 20:27.667
That's my phone. Would you read it to me?

20:27.670 --> 20:30.503
Ooh. Lacey texted!

20:30.506 --> 20:32.672
Sad face, skull and crossbones, and fire.

20:32.675 --> 20:35.375
Okay, so she's either
breaking up with you,

20:35.378 --> 20:37.310
or you have an STD.

20:37.313 --> 20:39.646
- I would kill for an STD right now.
- Mm.

20:39.649 --> 20:41.948
Who am I kidding?
I'm probably not even ready.

20:41.951 --> 20:43.483
I mean, I can't imagine
I'm any good at it.

20:43.486 --> 20:45.151
W-What if I'm not fast enough?

20:45.154 --> 20:47.287
I'm not sure speed is the goal.

20:47.290 --> 20:48.755
I mean, I've only been with myself,

20:48.758 --> 20:50.290
and even I'm disappointed sometimes.

20:50.293 --> 20:52.325
Come on. What I learned today

20:52.328 --> 20:54.728
is that we cannot be
so hard on ourselves.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.830
We got to focus on
our positive qualities.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.667
Dude, I have yogurt in my peeper.
