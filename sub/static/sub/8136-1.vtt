00:27.394 --> 00:29.294
$50,000, they do pass.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.852
$50,000, they don't.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.960
I smell a rat.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.160
Been dead
at least 24 hours.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.294
My sensors detect

00:38.405 --> 00:40.566
the vehicle is armored
with my protective shell.

00:40.673 --> 00:43.141
He took the bait.
We hooked him real good.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.614
I was always strongly attracted to you.

00:48.681 --> 00:50.842
Michael,
he's coming right for us!

01:05.265 --> 01:06.755
Knight Rider,

01:06.833 --> 01:09.427
a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world

01:09.536 --> 01:12.403
of a man who does not exist.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.850
Michael Knight, a young loner,

01:24.918 --> 01:27.443
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:27.520 --> 01:29.545
the helpless, the powerless,

01:29.622 --> 01:32.819
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

05:47.747 --> 05:50.409
Michael, I've searched
my data banks thoroughly,

05:50.483 --> 05:53.680
I can't find one redeeming
quality about gambling.

05:53.786 --> 05:57.381
KITT, look at it this way:
gambling is all odds.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.147
It's pure mathematics.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.590
Come on, I'll show you.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.127
I'd rather not.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.857
A little computer blackjack,
$1 a hand.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.922
I'm the house,
you're the player.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.694
I believe
the word is "sucker. "

06:08.801 --> 06:09.768
Okay.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.438
I've got a nine up,

06:13.506 --> 06:16.066
and you've got
a five and a six for 11.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.736
Do you want a card?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.175
I want to double down.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.736
KITT, that's doubling your bet
and you only get one card.

06:21.814 --> 06:22.940
You sure you wanna do that?

06:23.015 --> 06:25.506
Is the house in the habit
of advising the player?

06:25.585 --> 06:26.950
Your money.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.550
I believe that's 21.
Thank you, Michael.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.723
They call that
"beginner's luck," pal.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.954
As I understand it,
the phrase is,

06:36.028 --> 06:37.461
"shut up and deal. "

06:37.530 --> 06:39.361
Hold on to your horses,
hotshot,

06:39.432 --> 06:41.161
we've got Devon on the line.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.359
Hello, Devon!

06:42.468 --> 06:43.526
Hello, Michael.

06:43.636 --> 06:46.298
I'm glad to see that you're
getting into the spirit of things.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.534
Yeah, I'm already $2 behind.
What's up?

06:49.609 --> 06:52.908
Uh, there's, uh, someone
I want you to check out for me

06:52.979 --> 06:55.345
since you're going through
Las Vegas, anyway.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.316
Her name is, um, Rita Wilcox.

06:58.384 --> 07:00.511
She works at Caesars Palace.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.178
Okay, what are we looking for?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.313
I'm not sure.

07:03.389 --> 07:06.654
She tells a provocative but fantastic
story about a missing brother.

07:06.726 --> 07:09.058
All right.
I'll see what she has to say.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.618
With any luck, we should be

07:10.696 --> 07:13.790
pulling in to Vegas
about 10:00, 10:30 tonight.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.024
See you later.

07:15.134 --> 07:16.795
Right. Have a good day.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.264
Uh, you won't be here.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.740
I beg your pardon?

07:23.810 --> 07:26.244
Here, at 10:00 or 10:30.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.104
Your date tonight.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.282
Yes.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.647
The liaison in question

07:34.720 --> 07:37.450
is hardly a "date,"
it's an appointment.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.487
Devon,
she's a very beautiful woman.

07:42.328 --> 07:43.317
Yes,

07:43.396 --> 07:45.694
however she's also
the widow of Wilton Knight,

07:45.765 --> 07:47.232
who, as you may recall,

07:47.300 --> 07:51.464
created and continues to fund the
foundation for which we both work.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.061
Oh, I recall.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.504
Yes. However,
you're quite right.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.640
She is a beautiful woman.

07:57.710 --> 08:01.441
She's also a woman who never
does anything without a purpose.

08:50.630 --> 08:51.858
Devon.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.297
Elizabeth,
how nice to see you.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.361
You remembered.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.201
How could I forget?

09:03.042 --> 09:06.944
Devon, you look
absolutely wonderful.

09:07.446 --> 09:08.970
And so do you.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.779
I believe,
you used to say,

09:11.851 --> 09:13.614
"living well
is the best revenge. "

09:13.686 --> 09:16.519
Until someone comes up with
a better phrase, I still do.

09:16.589 --> 09:17.647
Gin and tonic?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.190
You remember.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.358
I'm so glad
you phoned.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.991
How long has it been?
Three years?

09:24.363 --> 09:26.593
Three years
and four months.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.724
But who's counting?

09:27.800 --> 09:28.789
I am.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.132
I'm not telling you anything
you didn't already know.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.638
I was always strongly attracted to you.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.232
And you knew it.
So did Wilton.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.011
That's why The Foundation
saw so little of me.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.947
Elizabeth, we've known
each other for too long

09:44.016 --> 09:45.950
not to keep it simple.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.483
What is it you want?

09:48.921 --> 09:51.355
Oh, Devon, you know
better than that.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.187
When Sigmund Freud
lay dying,

09:53.259 --> 09:55.750
his students all gathered
about him and they asked

09:55.828 --> 09:59.161
if there was one question
his work had not answered.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.823
And he replied,

10:01.634 --> 10:04.330
"What a woman really wants. "

10:06.973 --> 10:08.702
Well, there's no need
to be coy.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.765
Well, there's certainly
no need to rush.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.242
The future
is still the future.

10:14.013 --> 10:16.846
It will reveal itself
when it chooses.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.257
Boy, do I feel lucky.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.960
Well, then
don't play with her.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.559
She's a killer.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.230
Yeah.

11:47.339 --> 11:48.636
Garthe?

11:48.808 --> 11:51.902
No. No, name's Michael.
Does that surprise you?

11:52.178 --> 11:55.113
Uh, no, no.
It's, uh,

11:55.948 --> 11:59.213
just that you look so much
like somebody I-I know.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.920
Uh, place your bet.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.822
Hi, Rita,
name's Michael Knight.

12:06.325 --> 12:08.520
Devon Miles from
The Foundation sent me.

12:09.762 --> 12:12.094
I said not to send anybody
here. I can't talk here.

12:12.164 --> 12:13.222
Okay, where?

12:13.299 --> 12:15.062
Uh, I get off at midnight.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.725
Okay, thank you.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.267
And so I did everything

12:21.340 --> 12:24.468
the magazines say a wealthy,
attractive divorcee does.

12:24.543 --> 12:25.942
And more.

12:26.011 --> 12:28.878
Thank you, Roger.
That will be all tonight.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.106
Although I don't suppose
there was anything

12:31.183 --> 12:32.980
that would unduly shock a man,

12:33.052 --> 12:36.021
who appreciates life
as much as you do.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.980
And I gave up
being shocked years ago.

12:39.058 --> 12:42.118
I must tell you that
I'm having a wonderful time.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.185
In spite of
a nagging suspicion

12:44.263 --> 12:47.289
that somewhere,
you have an ulterior motive

12:47.366 --> 12:49.630
hidden between
the entree and dessert.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.464
No, no, no, no, no.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.334
No ulterior motives.
No, I gave that up long ago.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.569
When I want something
from a man, he knows it.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.701
Devon, would you be a dear
and open a window?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.305
It's a bit stuffy in here,
don't you think?

13:03.382 --> 13:04.940
Yes, of course.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.359
I was gonna be a singer
and Ron played piano.

13:19.431 --> 13:20.693
He played everything.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.462
Classical, bluegrass,
electric rock.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.138
Anyway,
when we ran out of money,

13:27.206 --> 13:28.901
we stopped here
and I got a job

13:28.974 --> 13:30.771
dealing blackjack
at Caesars.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.311
The next thing I know,
this mysterious man,

13:33.379 --> 13:35.939
the one you look
so much like, Garthe,

13:36.015 --> 13:37.778
he wouldn't leave me alone.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.875
Flowers every day, gifts.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.487
One of the gifts
was a job for Ron.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.647
The plot thickens.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.314
I suppose so.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.659
I sure didn't see it
at the time.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.752
Ron did odd jobs for him.

13:51.063 --> 13:53.190
It all began so innocently.

14:16.155 --> 14:18.055
And we went out twice.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.856
A limo to pick me up.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.155
Carte blanche
at the best shops in town.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.128
So many flowers
sent to the apartment

14:24.196 --> 14:26.221
that Ron's old allergies
came back.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.027
Well, it sounds
all right to me.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.069
All except for the allergies.
What happened?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.135
I've always believed
in love and romance,

14:33.205 --> 14:34.797
pretty much in that order.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.568
Garthe made it
clear that he didn't.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.974
He prefers to buy
what he wants.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.106
Okay, I think
I get the picture.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.909
Ron gets suspicious
of Garthe.

14:42.982 --> 14:46.748
Whatever he found out or overheard
went into a tape recorder,

14:47.019 --> 14:49.351
and the tapes
he hid in a locker

14:49.755 --> 14:51.950
right before he disappeared.

14:52.258 --> 14:55.455
I know it's not much to go on,
but it's all I've got.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.188
Michael,
something's happened to him

14:57.263 --> 14:59.231
and Garthe's behind it,
I know it.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.664
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.063
The key...

15:05.170 --> 15:06.262
Pardon?

15:06.372 --> 15:09.205
You said you'd found
the key to the locker.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.707
Do you know what
"antithesis" means?

15:12.778 --> 15:13.904
"Antithesis"?

15:13.979 --> 15:17.073
I think it was on last month's
Power Vocabulary Builder.

15:17.149 --> 15:20.482
I'm serious.
You're the antithesis of him.

15:20.886 --> 15:24.083
I have never seen 2 people
who look so much alike,

15:24.890 --> 15:27.085
who are so different inside.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.893
Be careful.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.931
And so one night in Innsbruck,

15:36.035 --> 15:38.469
before the entire
Norwegian ski team,

15:38.537 --> 15:40.368
he proposed a toast.

15:42.508 --> 15:43.736
Devon?

15:45.044 --> 15:47.239
Are you all right?

15:53.519 --> 15:55.487
You are a stubborn one.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.653
Now we shall begin.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.856
I have the formula.

16:02.928 --> 16:04.088
Good.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.117
One card.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.749
This better not be another 10.

17:06.825 --> 17:09.817
Ten. Thank you, Michael.
That makes 21.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.920
I'm telling you,
it's beginner's luck.

17:11.997 --> 17:13.430
That's what you said
yesterday.

17:13.499 --> 17:14.864
I'm no longer a beginner.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.958
In addition to which,
it's not luck.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.664
The odds in blackjack are 0.6
percent in favor of the house.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.240
However, if one applies-

17:22.340 --> 17:24.468
KITT, I wish your computers
had less on odds

17:24.542 --> 17:26.238
and more on the key
Rita gave me.

17:26.310 --> 17:29.178
A key from blank stock is extremely
difficult to trace, Michael.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.679
April's calling.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.318
Hello, April.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.547
Michael, you've got to
come back right away.

17:36.622 --> 17:37.850
Why, what's wrong?

17:37.923 --> 17:40.721
It's Devon. He went out with
an old friend last night, and...

17:41.894 --> 17:43.794
And what? Is he there?

17:43.862 --> 17:46.023
He's in the study
with Dr. Alpert.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.328
He wants you
to return immediately.

17:48.434 --> 17:51.961
Uh, April, I'll have to drop the
case he asked me to look into.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.369
Michael, whatever it is,
drop it.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.906
Devon was poisoned last night.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.600
Excuse me.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.106
Hey, glad I caught you.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.335
Did you find the locker?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.241
No, not yet.
Look, something's come up.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.973
You gotta postpone it
a day or two.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.708
You mean, uh, that's it?

18:36.782 --> 18:38.374
Sorry,
but what happened to Ron

18:38.450 --> 18:40.350
just doesn't measure up
in global importance?

18:40.419 --> 18:41.477
Look, Rita,
I promise you,

18:41.553 --> 18:43.953
I'll come back and find out
what happened to your brother.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.584
Rita!

19:11.016 --> 19:12.950
You're sure
you're okay to travel?

19:13.018 --> 19:14.610
Oh, Michael,
don't be so tiresome.

19:14.686 --> 19:18.144
Dr. Alpert assures me that
I'm in excellent condition.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.091
In all fairness, Devon,
he didn't say that.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.425
They were words
to that effect.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.895
All right,

19:26.465 --> 19:28.899
now I wanna know
what's going on.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.667
Well, it boils down,
unfortunately,

19:33.739 --> 19:35.900
to the fact
that Garthe Knight,

19:36.008 --> 19:37.566
Wilton's only son,

19:37.676 --> 19:39.405
has somehow been resurrected

19:39.478 --> 19:42.447
from 3 consecutive
life sentences in Africa.

19:43.682 --> 19:44.979
His son?

19:46.652 --> 19:49.086
Devon, the guy looks
just like me.

19:50.322 --> 19:51.755
What did Wilton Knight do,

19:51.823 --> 19:54.724
restructure my face
in Garthe's image?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.355
Well, he was certain,
as we all were,

19:57.429 --> 20:00.091
that Garthe would never
be seen by anybody again.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.395
Unfortunately,
we were wrong.

20:02.634 --> 20:03.999
He's returned.

20:04.102 --> 20:08.163
And I'm convinced that Garthe and
Elizabeth are after the formula.

20:10.242 --> 20:11.675
What formula?

20:11.743 --> 20:14.803
The formula for KITT's
Molecular Bonded Shell.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.620
You can imagine a shell

21:31.690 --> 21:33.851
as invulnerable as KITT's
in the wrong hands.

21:33.925 --> 21:36.758
Wilton divided the formula
into three separate elements,

21:36.828 --> 21:38.489
and entrusted
two of the elements

21:38.563 --> 21:40.724
to each
of 3 handpicked people.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.199
In other words,
any two of the three people

21:43.302 --> 21:46.032
could put their elements
together and have the formula.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.298
But one alone couldn't.

21:47.406 --> 21:48.373
Exactly.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.338
And you're worried about
the other two people.

21:50.409 --> 21:51.398
No, only one.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.035
The third man is alive
and well in Switzerland.

21:54.112 --> 21:57.548
The other man, Dr. Kyle
Elliott, is vacationing in Rio.

21:57.616 --> 22:00.517
But nobody's seen or heard
of him since last Tuesday.

22:00.585 --> 22:02.075
But Devon,
I thought you said

22:02.154 --> 22:04.486
that one man alone couldn't
reproduce the formula.

22:04.556 --> 22:07.457
Yes, I did.
I'm the second man, Michael.

22:07.859 --> 22:08.951
You?

22:09.027 --> 22:11.587
As you know, I had dinner
with Elizabeth Knight.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.722
I was drugged, poisoned.

22:14.232 --> 22:16.132
Dr. Alpert identified
the poison

22:16.234 --> 22:18.759
as a rare extract
from the African gum tree,

22:18.870 --> 22:20.235
called oluta.

22:20.305 --> 22:21.602
Devon, you survived.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.833
Yes, I survived,

22:22.941 --> 22:25.432
but the question is,
did the formula survive?

22:25.544 --> 22:28.138
Uh, oluta is used
as a truth serum.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.948
It's said to be even more
effective than sodium pentothal.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.780
Take care, Michael.

23:22.701 --> 23:25.499
Michael, did you say
3 consecutive life sentences?

23:25.604 --> 23:27.003
That's right, pal.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.801
My creator's son?

23:29.374 --> 23:30.739
One and the same.

23:30.809 --> 23:33.073
How difficult
for a man like Wilton Knight.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.613
What's this scoundrel
suspected of doing?

23:35.680 --> 23:39.081
Stealing the formula for
your Molecular Bonded Shell.

23:39.317 --> 23:41.751
Michael,
my shell is an exclusive.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.414
I know.
Let's hope it stays that way.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.186
All right,
let's get back to the key.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.163
Michael, a key made from
blank stock, is very hard to-

23:53.231 --> 23:55.028
KITT, I know
all about blank stock,

23:55.100 --> 23:56.431
more than I wanna know.

23:56.535 --> 23:57.934
I don't care
how difficult it is,

23:58.036 --> 23:59.594
I don't care
how long it takes.

23:59.704 --> 24:02.605
Finding those tapes
is the only clue we got here.

24:02.707 --> 24:06.040
Perhaps a little computer
blackjack to pass the time?

24:06.445 --> 24:08.572
I can't afford it.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.229
I certainly hope there's
nothing wrong with Dr. Elliott.

24:31.336 --> 24:32.803
Yes, so do I.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.420
Please contact
the nearest hospital

24:52.491 --> 24:54.959
with facilities
for treating exotic poisons.

24:55.026 --> 24:56.050
Poison?

24:56.127 --> 24:57.321
Yes, please hurry.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.460
Well?

25:05.670 --> 25:06.864
You're quite sure?

25:06.972 --> 25:09.372
He's been dead
at least 24 hours.

25:12.544 --> 25:13.943
Never mind.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.672
He will, uh, be all right?

25:18.750 --> 25:20.274
No, he's dead.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.611
Dead?

25:21.686 --> 25:24.280
Have you ever seen
this woman before?

25:26.892 --> 25:28.985
Uh, that's
Dr. Elliott's companion.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.186
Companion?

25:30.262 --> 25:31.786
You mean,
she was here with him?

25:31.863 --> 25:33.490
Yes, for 2 days.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.098
Thank you.

25:41.406 --> 25:43.465
Michael,
I think I may have something.

25:43.575 --> 25:45.805
The particular tumbler
configuration on this key

25:45.877 --> 25:47.276
was used on a brand of lock

25:47.345 --> 25:49.336
designed principally
for lockers.

25:49.414 --> 25:51.848
I know that, KITT,
that's what Rita said.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.214
Please let me finish.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.513
Sorry.

25:54.586 --> 25:57.282
I've cross-checked building
permits and dates of construction

25:57.355 --> 25:59.516
for every commercial
installation of said locker,

25:59.591 --> 26:01.218
and reduced it to 2 locations.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.385
One is a bowling alley
on Desert Drive,

26:03.428 --> 26:06.056
and the other
is a bus depot on Third.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.835
Los Angeles Express,

26:15.907 --> 26:19.172
boarding at Gate Number 6
to Barstow, Victorville,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.644
San Bernardino,
and Los Angeles.

27:23.174 --> 27:26.041
I have a little plan to
field-test Goliath tomorrow.

27:26.111 --> 27:27.408
I expect them to be ready.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.878
By noon, as promised.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.211
Will the shell be
completely hardened by then?

27:31.282 --> 27:33.773
Final coat is scheduled
to be applied at 8:00 a.m.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.616
It will reach maximum density
within an hour-and-a-half.

27:36.688 --> 27:39.156
That's very good.
What about the rockets?

27:39.224 --> 27:40.885
They are ready
for installation.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.620
Proceed.
Yes, sir.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.403
It's still too soon
to know everything,

28:33.478 --> 28:35.378
but I'm convinced
that they are planning

28:35.447 --> 28:38.075
some kind of, I-I don't know,
action at Red Bluff.

28:38.149 --> 28:40.413
They're meeting out there
in the desert somewhere.

28:40.485 --> 28:42.146
I'll try
and find the location,

28:42.220 --> 28:44.313
but what's important
is Red Bluff.

28:45.023 --> 28:46.513
The name Red Bluff

28:46.591 --> 28:49.992
seems to have a particular
but undefined significance.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.050
Check it out.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.797
It's not a city or town.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.894
Okay. Try mountains,

29:01.172 --> 29:03.936
parks, geographical areas.

29:05.343 --> 29:06.708
Nothing, I'm afraid.

29:06.778 --> 29:08.370
That's strange.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.014
Wonder if Rita
can shed some light?

29:11.082 --> 29:14.176
Perhaps she can,
if she's still talking to you.

29:42.046 --> 29:43.877
Hey, you were right.

29:44.983 --> 29:46.416
About what?

29:46.718 --> 29:48.083
This key.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.384
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.392
I'm talking about this.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.353
Thanks, Bruce.

30:03.201 --> 30:04.759
Don't ever do that again.

30:04.869 --> 30:05.961
What?

30:06.070 --> 30:08.231
Bring up private business
in a public situation.

30:08.339 --> 30:10.307
Well, I wanted to make sure
I got your attention.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.376
You had it.
You don't have it anymore.

30:12.443 --> 30:14.343
Who does? Garthe?

30:17.015 --> 30:19.040
What's Red Bluff, Rita?

30:19.317 --> 30:20.375
I have no idea.

30:20.451 --> 30:23.011
Well, your brother did. It's
what those tapes are all about,

30:23.087 --> 30:25.248
Red Bluff
and Garthe Knight.

30:26.457 --> 30:27.981
Thanks for your help,
really,

30:28.059 --> 30:30.994
but, uh, this is not
the time or the place.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.503
I want him dead,
both of them.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.508
They know too much
already.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.168
Now, Mother,
if it were up to you,

30:46.244 --> 30:48.804
half the world
would be dead already.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.314
All she knows
is what I tell her.

30:52.417 --> 30:54.942
All he knows
is what she tells him.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.549
Dead end, riddle.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.889
Let him chase his tail.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.224
I was hoping your brush
with life imprisonment

31:06.297 --> 31:09.164
would teach you
something about discipline.

31:09.901 --> 31:13.132
Discipline has never been
a problem, Mother dear.

31:14.005 --> 31:17.236
Mark my words,
Michael Knight will die.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.476
After all,

31:20.745 --> 31:24.772
he was designed by my late, great
father to replace me, wasn't he?

31:26.818 --> 31:30.254
How could I possibly tolerate
his life on this earth?

31:31.990 --> 31:33.548
Michael Knight,

31:35.226 --> 31:40.027
is a living,
breathing, insult

31:41.466 --> 31:43.093
to my existence.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.704
Garthe and Elizabeth
have the formula, Michael.

31:54.779 --> 31:57.577
And they want it
bad enough to kill for it?

31:57.649 --> 31:58.843
Why?

31:59.083 --> 32:00.880
Devon,
what have they got in mind?

32:00.985 --> 32:02.953
That's what
you have to find out.

32:02.987 --> 32:05.922
Well, I've checked into the
time Garthe spent in Africa.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.855
While he was in prison,
he became close

32:07.926 --> 32:10.190
with a revolutionary
named Tsombe Kuna,

32:10.261 --> 32:13.059
founder of the Pan-African
Liberation Movement.

32:13.131 --> 32:16.259
Somehow Garthe doesn't impress
me as a political animal.

32:16.401 --> 32:19.928
We think Garthe and Tsombe
have become business partners.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.165
Garthe had
the trunk full of leases

32:22.273 --> 32:24.002
on unsafe diamond mines,

32:24.075 --> 32:25.770
and Tsombe had
thousands of followers

32:25.843 --> 32:27.606
who'd walk off
the edge of the world

32:27.679 --> 32:28.873
at his command.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.209
Instead, he commanded

32:30.281 --> 32:32.977
that they walk into the
diamond mines, and they did.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.450
Many died.

32:34.519 --> 32:37.682
We estimate they mined over
$50,000,000 worth of diamonds

32:37.755 --> 32:38.847
before they left.

32:38.923 --> 32:39.981
Wow.

32:40.058 --> 32:41.992
Any news on Red Bluff?

32:42.060 --> 32:45.587
Yes and no.
I'll keep you posted.

32:45.663 --> 32:46.687
Bye-bye.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.224
Michael,
the phrase "yes and no"

32:49.300 --> 32:52.098
is an insult to the precision
of the English language.

32:53.304 --> 32:54.669
That's why I like it.

32:54.739 --> 32:56.206
Would you care to define?

32:56.307 --> 32:57.865
KITT, English is the problem.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.967
As the state geologist
pointed out,

33:00.044 --> 33:02.638
this area's had a number
of different names.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.080
Spanish, before that, Indian.

33:05.283 --> 33:08.810
I suppose we're off to the
department of Indian Affairs.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.178
In a manner of speaking.

33:27.672 --> 33:28.832
Hello.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.540
Hello.

33:37.048 --> 33:38.140
Hey.

33:38.216 --> 33:41.344
You wanna buy one of Chief's
previously owned personal automobiles?

33:41.419 --> 33:43.580
No, thanks,
I already got one.

33:43.654 --> 33:45.087
Gas guzzler.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.320
Let me slip you
into a real economy car, man.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.621
Save you big bucks.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.525
Uh, maybe some other time.

33:51.596 --> 33:54.861
What I need to know is
if there's a place out here

33:54.932 --> 33:57.230
the Indians called
"Red Bluff"?

33:58.836 --> 34:01.566
that's an old
Indian burial ground.

34:01.672 --> 34:03.765
Can you tell me
where it is?

34:04.442 --> 34:05.670
You can't go there.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.108
Why not?

34:07.211 --> 34:08.906
Government land.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.414
You mean, uh,
protected for the Indians.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.445
That's what
the government says.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.315
But the Indians
can't go there either.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.684
Catch-22.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.887
I know the feeling.

34:20.123 --> 34:22.558
I'd still like to know
where it is.

34:24.762 --> 34:25.922
Okay.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.427
Go straight out I-15.

34:29.534 --> 34:30.558
Okay.

34:45.216 --> 34:46.239
Michael,

34:46.317 --> 34:48.478
we are approaching the
mountain known as "Red Bluff. "

34:48.553 --> 34:49.952
All right.

35:18.516 --> 35:21.041
Looks like
any other mountain to me.

35:23.020 --> 35:26.615
Why would Rita's brother Ron
emphasize it the way he did?

35:26.824 --> 35:28.223
You got me.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.124
Wait a minute, I got an idea.

35:31.762 --> 35:34.959
Let's see if there's more to
Red Bluff than meets the eye.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.532
KITT,
activate your X-ray mode.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.434
Right away, Michael.

35:44.675 --> 35:46.643
What's that at the base?

35:46.711 --> 35:48.178
How extraordinary.

35:48.246 --> 35:50.646
Michael, it appears to be
2 large doors.

35:50.715 --> 35:53.650
But my X-ray mode
is blocked by leaded plates.

35:53.718 --> 35:57.051
Huge doors and leaded plates
in the middle of the desert?

35:57.121 --> 35:58.884
What is Red Bluff hiding?

35:58.956 --> 36:01.083
That's a real good question.

36:45.303 --> 36:46.327
Hello, April.

36:46.437 --> 36:47.461
Hi, Michael.

36:47.572 --> 36:48.903
Good to see you, Michael.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.372
Hello, Devon.

36:52.276 --> 36:54.005
Well, I talked to Gen. Maddux.

36:54.078 --> 36:56.171
He denies any SAC
or Air Force installation

36:56.247 --> 36:57.908
at the Red Bluff location.

36:57.982 --> 37:00.951
Assuming it is some kind of
top-secret weapons system,

37:01.052 --> 37:03.111
what do you think
Garthe's trying to accomplish?

37:03.154 --> 37:04.314
I mean, why?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.686
Well, whatever it is,
I have a feeling

37:06.757 --> 37:10.625
the, uh, Pan-African Liberation
Movement is at the heart of it.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.953
Michael, if you're right
about Red Bluff,

37:13.030 --> 37:14.327
we'll need some kind of proof.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.492
Otherwise, Gen. Maddux will
stonewall to the very end.

37:17.602 --> 37:19.194
April,
what are the chances

37:19.303 --> 37:21.203
of beefing up
KITT's X-ray mode?

37:21.272 --> 37:23.399
To penetrate lead? Never.

37:23.941 --> 37:25.374
But we could try infrared.

37:25.443 --> 37:26.501
Good.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.477
April, try to come up
with something.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.912
I have a stop to make first,
then I'll join you.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.142
Anything
I can help with?

37:32.216 --> 37:35.652
No, I'm afraid this is what
is known as a one-man job.

37:36.988 --> 37:40.116
It's, uh,
as you say, a long shot.

37:45.162 --> 37:46.720
See you later.

38:07.351 --> 38:09.876
Devon!
My, what a lovely surprise.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.081
I hardly think so,
Elizabeth.

38:12.156 --> 38:13.748
May I come in?
But of course.

38:13.824 --> 38:15.189
Thank you.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.428
May I get you something?

38:22.500 --> 38:23.797
Arsenic.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.866
A little sodium pentothal,
perhaps?

38:28.906 --> 38:30.737
Elizabeth, I want you
to stop this insanity

38:30.808 --> 38:32.241
that you and Garthe
are planning.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.574
Oh, Devon,
how like Wilton you are.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.739
So dramatic,
such a flair for hyperbole.

38:38.249 --> 38:41.412
I want you to know that
I flew to Rio de Janeiro.

38:41.752 --> 38:43.652
I found Dr. Elliott.

38:44.021 --> 38:47.013
I also know that
you were there and I know why.

38:47.091 --> 38:48.820
Yes, I did visit him in Rio.

38:48.893 --> 38:50.690
After all, we're old friends.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.922
The fact that he died
shortly after I left

38:52.997 --> 38:56.433
had more to do with a bad
heart than exotic poison.

38:57.635 --> 38:59.159
I said nothing
about poison.

39:00.304 --> 39:01.669
Oh, Devon.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.803
You are such a dear,
and so charming,

39:06.577 --> 39:08.545
but you are so suspicious.

39:08.612 --> 39:11.911
I have no intention of
sparring with you, Elizabeth.

39:12.116 --> 39:14.016
I know that
you have the formula

39:14.085 --> 39:16.485
for KITT's
Molecular Bonded Shell.

39:16.554 --> 39:18.283
I also know about Red Bluff.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.687
Now, isn't that enough?

39:19.757 --> 39:20.849
No.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.862
I believe you two
already know each other.

39:27.965 --> 39:31.230
Yes, it's been
quite some time.

39:31.902 --> 39:34.234
Before your
African experience.

39:36.140 --> 39:39.166
You know, you're amazingly
like my late father.

39:39.443 --> 39:41.377
Perhaps that's why
I dislike you so.

39:41.445 --> 39:44.209
Garthe, I came here to reason
with you and your mother.

39:44.281 --> 39:46.841
It's too late for reason,
Mr. Miles.

39:48.119 --> 39:51.282
It's too late
for anything but war.

39:52.256 --> 39:55.419
Our victory, your defeat.

39:57.461 --> 39:59.520
And you will be defeated.

39:59.663 --> 40:02.791
You, The Foundation
for Law and Government,

40:03.801 --> 40:05.598
and Michael Knight.

40:06.537 --> 40:10.166
Especially, Michael Knight.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.351
Any luck on Tsombe Kuna?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.157
Just what you had.

40:32.296 --> 40:33.456
But I think I know

40:33.531 --> 40:36.500
how Garthe beat those
3 consecutive life sentences.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.862
I have a feeling
it wasn't due process.

40:38.969 --> 40:41.028
I don't think he knows
the meaning of the words.

40:41.138 --> 40:43.436
April,
a top government official

40:43.507 --> 40:45.975
arranged for
a presidential pardon.

40:46.143 --> 40:48.771
2 weeks later,
the guy commits suicide.

40:48.846 --> 40:50.973
What makes you think
there's a connection?

40:51.048 --> 40:53.744
The official in question
was accused of taking bribes.

40:53.818 --> 40:57.777
One of the bribes was a
dozen leases on diamond mines.

40:58.422 --> 41:00.151
Arranged by
a mysterious woman

41:00.257 --> 41:02.157
who happens to fit
the description

41:02.193 --> 41:03.990
of Elizabeth Knight.

41:07.932 --> 41:10.696
I wonder if there's anything
she wouldn't do for Garthe.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.860
For Garthe or for herself?

41:13.270 --> 41:14.760
How's the infrared coming?

41:14.872 --> 41:16.032
I'm almost finished.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.105
Maybe that's Devon.

41:21.579 --> 41:22.807
Hello.

41:23.714 --> 41:26.205
Yeah, when? Okay, thanks.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.380
Not Devon.

41:29.453 --> 41:31.216
No, it's Rita Wilcox.

41:31.288 --> 41:34.155
She left a message. Says she wants
to see me as soon as possible.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.852
Says it's urgent.

41:57.381 --> 41:59.713
I'm sorry
I acted the way I did.

42:01.552 --> 42:03.918
Among other things,
I was angry.

42:04.455 --> 42:07.754
Yeah, I could tell. That's
okay, I don't need a glass.

42:09.593 --> 42:11.823
I thought you'd found
something more interesting to do

42:11.896 --> 42:13.420
than search for my brother.

42:13.497 --> 42:16.295
I- I felt so powerless
after you left.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.562
Like nobody cared
whether Ron was dead or alive.

42:18.669 --> 42:20.796
That explains your anger.
It doesn't explain

42:20.905 --> 42:23.169
why one day you're
in a $300-a-month apartment,

42:23.240 --> 42:25.606
and the next
you're in a $300-a-day suite,

42:25.676 --> 42:28.110
tipping blackjack dealers
$100 chips.

42:28.178 --> 42:30.237
I decided to take
Garthe up on his offer.

42:30.314 --> 42:31.781
Oh, I figured that one out.

42:31.849 --> 42:33.908
What I couldn't figure out
is why.

42:33.984 --> 42:35.315
Isn't it obvious?

42:35.386 --> 42:37.149
I'm convinced
he had Ron killed.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.280
So to punish him
you became his mistress?

42:39.356 --> 42:41.688
I did what I did
for one reason:

42:41.759 --> 42:44.387
to find proof
that he killed my brother.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.588
All right. Did you find it?

42:47.865 --> 42:49.856
Not yet, not everything.

42:50.467 --> 42:53.231
But I did overhear something
tonight that could be important,

42:53.337 --> 42:55.805
and, uh,
I thought you should know.

42:56.774 --> 42:58.298
I'm listening.

42:58.943 --> 43:02.174
A man named Tsombe Kuna
is arriving tomorrow morning.

43:02.279 --> 43:04.770
Garthe has a demonstration
planned for him at noon.

43:04.815 --> 43:06.840
A demonstration of what?

43:08.285 --> 43:09.616
All he said was,

43:09.687 --> 43:12.349
"The shell is ready.
Goliath is born. "

43:13.057 --> 43:14.319
Goliath.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.890
Does that mean
anything to you?

43:50.995 --> 43:52.360
Greetings, my brother.

43:52.429 --> 43:53.919
Greetings, brother.

43:55.199 --> 43:56.928
I have got
a surprise for you.

43:57.034 --> 44:00.003
I didn't travel 6,000 miles
to get bored.

44:00.037 --> 44:02.767
Bored you shall not be.
Follow me.

44:15.519 --> 44:17.817
Meet Goliath.

44:20.090 --> 44:22.490
It's all
you promised.

44:23.127 --> 44:24.992
Magnificent.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.957
In less than two hours,

44:28.032 --> 44:30.592
you will see him
in all his splendor,

44:30.901 --> 44:32.630
and all his glory.

44:33.804 --> 44:35.032
Go ahead.

44:41.578 --> 44:43.170
Magnificent.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.765
All right.

45:05.235 --> 45:08.295
Let's see if April's infrared
can penetrate those leaded doors.

45:08.405 --> 45:09.963
The odds on
infrared penetrating

45:10.074 --> 45:11.132
from this distance-

45:11.241 --> 45:12.708
KITT, just do it.

45:12.776 --> 45:14.175
Very well.

45:24.421 --> 45:26.048
Missiles.

45:28.025 --> 45:30.186
The Molecular Bonded Shell.

45:30.461 --> 45:32.622
A revolutionary from Africa.

45:32.996 --> 45:34.588
Shall I call Devon?

45:34.665 --> 45:36.599
No, no, no, not yet.

45:36.667 --> 45:39.158
I want to see what Garthe's
demonstration is first.

46:02.359 --> 46:04.759
Michael, you're sure
this is the right way?

46:04.828 --> 46:07.023
According to what Rita said.

46:20.410 --> 46:21.707
Okay, that's enough.

46:51.441 --> 46:52.703
Okay, go!

46:59.750 --> 47:00.910
KITT.

47:02.853 --> 47:04.343
I smell a rat.

47:26.310 --> 47:29.575
You see what I see?

47:32.616 --> 47:34.607
It appears to be a large...

47:34.685 --> 47:36.118
My goodness.

47:36.186 --> 47:38.848
Large isn't the word.
It's enormous.

47:40.123 --> 47:41.351
Goliath.

47:41.592 --> 47:44.823
I believe it's time for a
strategic withdrawal, Michael.

47:44.895 --> 47:46.453
Not so fast.

47:46.997 --> 47:49.158
Let's see what
Garthe's got in mind.

47:49.233 --> 47:51.360
My sensors detect
the vehicle in question

47:51.468 --> 47:53.299
is armored with
my protective shell.

47:53.403 --> 47:55.166
Michael,
surely you're not planning

47:55.272 --> 47:57.240
to go nose-to-nose
with that behemoth.

47:57.341 --> 47:59.673
That's what I want
Garthe to think, pal.

47:59.743 --> 48:03.736
But if we're quick enough, we can
knock out his right front wheel.

49:40.010 --> 49:41.272
KITT?

49:42.546 --> 49:44.070
KITT, are you all right?

49:48.352 --> 49:49.478
KITT?

49:49.586 --> 49:50.883
KITT!

49:51.321 --> 49:54.779
Come on, buddy,
talk to me, huh?

49:58.061 --> 49:59.585
It's my fault.

50:02.232 --> 50:03.893
I overmatched us.

50:04.701 --> 50:06.362
I overmatched you.

50:07.971 --> 50:09.336
I'm sorry.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.907
I'm afraid we zigged

50:12.009 --> 50:13.601
when we should have zagged,
Michael.

50:13.677 --> 50:14.939
Hey!

50:16.279 --> 50:17.746
You're all right, huh?

50:17.814 --> 50:20.612
"All right" hardly seems
appropriate, Michael.

50:20.684 --> 50:23.949
Look what that-that
behemoth did to me.

50:26.957 --> 50:28.254
Yeah.

50:28.892 --> 50:30.519
Now I know what

50:30.594 --> 50:33.222
being run over by a truck
really feels like.

50:33.296 --> 50:35.662
Michael, my computer
functions are damaged

50:35.732 --> 50:39.691
so I can't make a diagnosis,
but you sound terrible.

50:39.970 --> 50:41.597
You need a doctor.

50:46.009 --> 50:48.705
Listen, try and contact
Devon or April.

50:51.548 --> 50:54.278
Some way, we got to
get out of this mess.

50:54.351 --> 50:56.478
I've sustained
a good deal of damage.

50:56.553 --> 50:59.021
I'm afraid
I can't contact anyone.

50:59.089 --> 51:01.557
In fact,
the odds on our ability-

51:01.658 --> 51:04.889
KITT, not now, please.

51:08.231 --> 51:09.562
Hey.

51:09.900 --> 51:12.095
There's not a taxi in sight.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.769
Pretty soon
it's gonna be hot enough

51:18.842 --> 51:20.969
to melt rocks
out here, pal.

51:22.512 --> 51:24.446
We got to get you
running again.

51:24.514 --> 51:26.846
I'm not sure that's possible.

51:26.917 --> 51:29.442
Well, I can't move you.
It better be.

51:31.455 --> 51:32.854
All right.

51:35.992 --> 51:37.960
Let's go back to basics.

51:39.696 --> 51:41.288
Take a look at your ESB.

51:41.364 --> 51:42.991
What in the world is that?

51:45.302 --> 51:47.736
Your Emergency
Schematic Blueprint.

51:47.938 --> 51:49.906
You haven't forgotten that,
have you?

51:50.006 --> 51:52.099
It's coming back to me now.

52:12.028 --> 52:13.723
Looks like Greek to me.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.424
I beg your pardon?

52:15.499 --> 52:17.262
It's just a phrase.

52:17.701 --> 52:19.464
It's just a phrase.

52:33.917 --> 52:35.908
I can't raise Michael or KITT.

52:35.986 --> 52:38.113
It's like they've vanished.

52:38.421 --> 52:41.288
I wish Michael hadn't rushed
into the desert like a Bedouin.

52:41.358 --> 52:42.882
It's all my fault.

52:42.959 --> 52:44.790
I should have waited
until I knew more.

52:44.861 --> 52:47.091
Nonsense.
Michael's perfectly capable

52:47.164 --> 52:49.359
of assessing the risks
in this situation.

52:49.432 --> 52:51.491
I know how this must look.

52:51.968 --> 52:53.629
Me back with Garthe,

52:53.737 --> 52:56.228
and-and passing
the information on to Michael.

52:56.339 --> 52:58.398
Rita, Michael believed you.

52:58.808 --> 53:00.002
So do we.

53:00.110 --> 53:02.135
Well, there is no point
in standing around here,

53:02.179 --> 53:03.806
waiting and wondering.

53:04.314 --> 53:06.179
I'm flying to
SAC headquarters

53:06.249 --> 53:07.375
as soon as possible.

53:07.450 --> 53:09.247
April, I want you
to stand by,

53:09.319 --> 53:10.752
just in the event of...

53:10.820 --> 53:13.220
I have the semi on full alert
and ready to roll.

53:13.290 --> 53:15.190
You'll stay with us,
of course.

53:15.258 --> 53:17.488
I should go back
to the hotel.

53:17.661 --> 53:19.322
I'm afraid
it's more than likely

53:19.396 --> 53:20.988
Garthe is suspicious of you.

53:21.064 --> 53:23.828
In fact, he may have used you
to lure Michael out there.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.458
If that's true,

53:25.569 --> 53:27.537
he'll be suspicious
if I don't return.

53:27.604 --> 53:29.572
And if it isn't,
there's still a chance

53:29.639 --> 53:32.107
I can find something
that will help.

53:41.952 --> 53:44.887
And I thought putting
a barbecue together was hard.

53:45.155 --> 53:47.749
Michael, I never felt
this way before.

53:47.824 --> 53:49.587
That makes two of us.

53:49.659 --> 53:53.459
I mean, so vulnerable.
So mortal.

53:54.564 --> 53:57.397
Do you think it's possible
I could cease to exist?

53:57.467 --> 53:59.458
If I don't get you
running pretty soon,

54:01.438 --> 54:03.406
you can put money on it.

54:07.010 --> 54:08.307
Terrific!

54:09.145 --> 54:11.238
Along with everything else,

54:13.550 --> 54:16.280
90 percent of your
turbine blades are shot.

54:16.353 --> 54:19.880
My turbine? Oh, goodness.
Without that, I'm powerless.

54:20.924 --> 54:23.620
Maybe. Maybe not.

54:25.128 --> 54:26.254
KITT.

54:27.597 --> 54:28.962
If I can figure
this mess out,

54:29.032 --> 54:30.761
maybe I can
jerry-rig a ramjet.

54:30.834 --> 54:32.131
A ramjet?

54:32.369 --> 54:34.633
But, Michael, my exhaust
system isn't designed

54:34.738 --> 54:38.196
to accommodate the kind of
temperatures a ramjet will produce.

54:38.308 --> 54:42.540
Not to mention the fact that
navigation will be virtually impossible.

54:43.580 --> 54:46.242
Yeah, well,
we're a long way from home.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.847
We're just gonna have to
take our chances.

54:53.623 --> 54:56.251
Devon, you have to
understand my position.

54:56.326 --> 54:59.989
You can't walk in here with
this-this incredible story

55:00.030 --> 55:02.430
and expect me
to take it to the President.

55:02.465 --> 55:04.296
Red Bluff
is going to be attacked.

55:04.401 --> 55:05.629
I can guarantee that.

55:05.735 --> 55:06.702
Just prove it.

55:06.803 --> 55:09.271
Give me a shred of evidence,
Devon. Anything.

55:09.906 --> 55:11.601
I've told you all I know.

55:11.675 --> 55:15.111
African messiahs, Las Vegas
plots, some crazy formula.

55:15.178 --> 55:17.646
My God, do you have any idea
what that sounds like?

55:17.714 --> 55:20.274
Yes. An international crisis.

55:21.051 --> 55:22.916
Let's say someone
were crazy enough

55:22.986 --> 55:24.851
to go after Red Bluff,

55:25.021 --> 55:26.215
they'd never get in.

55:26.289 --> 55:28.052
That mountain
is safer than Fort Knox.

55:28.124 --> 55:29.716
And why? Why?

55:29.993 --> 55:31.927
To steal our missiles?

55:33.196 --> 55:34.288
Come on, Devon.

55:34.364 --> 55:36.423
Why is it so preposterous?

55:36.566 --> 55:38.966
Missile capability
in a Third World country

55:39.069 --> 55:41.401
could easily determine
the balance of power,

55:41.471 --> 55:43.462
and instantly command
global respect.

55:45.108 --> 55:47.542
I appreciate
your concern, Devon.

55:48.878 --> 55:51.608
But you and The Foundation take
care of your part of the world.

55:51.681 --> 55:54.149
We'll take care of ours.
Excuse me.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.252
Yes?

56:25.915 --> 56:27.473
Michael?

56:28.451 --> 56:29.577
Yeah.

56:30.620 --> 56:32.554
I'll be right with you.

56:34.791 --> 56:36.088
Are we ready?

56:36.159 --> 56:38.286
We'll find out in a minute.

56:39.896 --> 56:41.693
Michael, I'm worried.

56:41.998 --> 56:43.295
Me, too.

56:45.435 --> 56:46.493
Okay.

56:48.104 --> 56:50.197
Hang on, buddy. Here we go.

56:54.310 --> 56:56.278
Come on, buddy, come on!

56:58.248 --> 56:59.772
So far, so good!

57:00.283 --> 57:01.648
All right!

57:10.260 --> 57:11.284
It's working!

57:11.361 --> 57:13.522
Yes, but now
the question is, "Where?"

57:13.596 --> 57:15.791
My directional equipment
isn't functioning.

57:15.865 --> 57:17.730
Let's just try
straight ahead.

57:27.710 --> 57:28.938
Yeah!

58:03.246 --> 58:06.443
Michael, at our present speed
of 310 miles per hour,

58:06.516 --> 58:08.609
the odds of survival are...

58:12.021 --> 58:14.683
My odds calculator
just malfunctioned.

58:16.226 --> 58:18.421
Look out, there's a mountain.

58:40.617 --> 58:42.517
Michael, can't we slow down?

58:42.585 --> 58:43.813
I hear you.

58:43.887 --> 58:46.321
But this ramjet's
tough to control!

58:46.389 --> 58:47.686
Hang on, buddy!

58:47.757 --> 58:49.418
But where on earth
are we going?

58:49.492 --> 58:51.517
Out of the desert!

59:08.411 --> 59:09.901
Everything in order?

59:09.979 --> 59:12.539
The rockets are ready
and armed, sir.

59:14.350 --> 59:18.081
A miracle
of American technology.

59:18.154 --> 59:20.247
If this is
anyone's miracle,

59:20.423 --> 59:21.617
it's mine.

59:21.691 --> 59:24.159
Of course it is,
my dear Garthe.

59:24.227 --> 59:26.388
Why, you could walk on water

59:26.462 --> 59:28.259
if it were necessary,
couldn't you?

59:28.331 --> 59:31.164
I've got a dozen things to do.
So, if you don't mind.

59:31.267 --> 59:32.757
But I do mind.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.003
Very much.

59:35.672 --> 59:39.608
I have a rather substantial
investment to protect.

59:39.709 --> 59:42.371
And I find myself worrying.

59:43.446 --> 59:44.435
About?

59:44.514 --> 59:45.538
You.

59:45.615 --> 59:48.778
So much depends on your
success in the next 24 hours.

59:48.851 --> 59:51.411
There must be
no distractions.

59:51.921 --> 59:55.015
It's one thing
to witness a demonstration.

59:55.291 --> 59:56.588
Quite another

59:56.659 --> 01:00:00.493
to learn of your personal
vendetta in this matter.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.690
No one tells me
how to proceed with Red Bluff.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.468
My mother doesn't,
and you don't.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:09.237
Without me,
you'd still be in the bush,

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:10.636
dodging spears.

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:13.699
Without me, you'd still be
rotting in jail.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.843
So, you see,

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:18.745
we are mutually indebted
to each other.

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.576
With luck, we shall continue

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.585
a long and fruitful
relationship.

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.622
For your information,

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:30.147
I have many men
who are excellent drivers,

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:32.558
if you prove unreliable.

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:36.028
Don't you threaten me.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.896
That's not a threat.

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:43.270
Just a reminder.

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:06.354
Nothing?

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.587
No.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.029
How did it go
with the General?

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:10.224
It didn't.

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.529
Without a signed affidavit
from Garthe Knight

01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:15.502
detailing his plan,
nobody will believe it.

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.341
To think that Michael
may have given his life

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:20.876
for nothing.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.744
We've got to keep hoping.
Praying.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.513
I've contacted
the National Guard.

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.847
I spoke with a Col. Abrams.
He said that...

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.111
That's probably him now.

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:36.219
Devon!

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.839
Michael, are you
absolutely positive

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.076
that this Goliath

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.109
was equipped with
the Molecular Bonded Shell?

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:05.415
Devon, you saw KITT.

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:07.353
What else
could have done that?

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:10.551
Why would Garthe and Elizabeth
take the trouble?

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.356
Certainly not to destroy
you and KITT.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:17.695
You take over 14 tons
of steel and engine,

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.894
and you cover it
with that shell,

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:21.970
it can go through anything.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.436
Red Bluff.

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:25.974
He's going to use it to
penetrate the missile site.

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.303
That's my guess, too.

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.708
Yes. Gen. Maddux did concede

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.770
that SAC is preparing
to rotate

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:33.611
updated missiles at Red Bluff.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:34.672
When?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:35.775
In less than 12 hours.

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:38.082
That doesn't leave us
much time, does it?

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:40.486
Time for what? Michael,
you're not in any condition-

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.080
Devon, listen to me.

01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:44.490
Garthe could have
killed me out there.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.959
He didn't.

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:47.461
You got any idea why?

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:48.554
None.

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:50.326
See how this fits.

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:51.991
That show with Goliath,

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.968
with Garthe flexing
his muscles for my benefit.

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.470
He could have killed me,

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:59.201
but he wants me
to see him win at Red Bluff.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:01.368
He needs me, don't you see?

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.104
To prove he's a better man.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:06.206
Assuming you're right,
where does it help us?

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:09.115
I think I know a way
we can use it against him.

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.415
Garthe couldn't stand
losing to me.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.352
Any place, any time.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.323
With KITT's help,

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:17.757
I think I know
a way to beat him.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:34.675
It wasn't a fair fight, April.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.678
It was like putting
Sugar Ray in the ring

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:38.270
with an overgrown heavyweight.

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:40.212
I'm sure it was, KITT.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:42.877
It won't happen again,
I can assure you of that.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.442
Well, it better not.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.249
We've got you
patched together

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:48.813
with Scotch tape
and baling wire as it is.

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:51.883
If I ever see that
snout-nosed ignoramus again-

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:54.759
You'd better hope he's heading
in the opposite direction.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.765
I'm already reviewing
my computer logs

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.095
of our confrontation.

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.429
In a matter of hours,

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.127
I'll know everything
there is to know

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:02.898
about that
banana-headed bovine.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.734
You tell him, KITT.

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:06.600
How's it coming?

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.677
Oh, he should be ready soon.

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.735
You see that
little black box up there?

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.075
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.642
What happened?

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.280
Well, for the ultra-frequency
modulator to work

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.880
from the required distance,

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:24.449
I had to install
a modified laser power pack.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.825
Why, I think
it's over-modified.

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:28.252
Don't worry.

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:30.731
I'll have it adjusted
before you need it.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.597
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.360
Here's that explosive charge
you asked for.

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:36.836
Oh, thanks.

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.373
Do you actually plan

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.171
on getting close enough
to plant that on Goliath?

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:43.178
Yeah, that's the plan.

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:45.747
Well, I won't ask how.

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.311
I, uh,

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.545
I really don't want to know.

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:42.793
Rita.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.062
Oh.

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:47.502
Y-you startled me.

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.603
I thought
you'd gone shopping.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.444
I did.
I couldn't find anything.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.782
Does that mean
I'm getting jaded?

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:58.979
No.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:00.912
No, I hope not.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.621
I'd hate to think,

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:07.655
our special
little times together

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.664
were becoming ordinary.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.870
There's no one but me,

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:17.800
is there?

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.473
No, of course not.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.005
How could there be?

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.842
No, there couldn't.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.511
You remember that.

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.988
Now, you run along.

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:46.534
By the way,

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.138
I'm sorry to hear about Ron.

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.436
What did you say?

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.741
I thought
you had been informed.

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.940
A rock collector
found your brother's body

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.539
in the desert.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:09.652
Michael, I must say

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:11.215
I have my doubts about this.

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:13.693
All you got to do
is help me out with the dice.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.355
Garthe's ego
will do the rest.

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.659
If you say so.

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.340
Come on, 55.

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:43.514
Here we go, buddy.

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:48.387
I've been notified
that she's leaving her room.

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:49.624
You want me to tail her?

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:50.722
No.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.525
Let her continue
to think she's free.

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:55.604
And, uh, when
we leave for Red Bluff,

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:58.138
have her join
her beloved brother.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.910
Your dice, Mr. Knight.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.448
$5,000, they do pass.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.278
$5,000.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.747
They don't pass.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.630
Two crap, two. Line away.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.598
The don't and last comes
get paid.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.068
Tough luck.

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:31.564
Hey, it's you.

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:32.640
Hey.

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:35.175
A couple of nights ago
at the blackjack table,

01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:36.939
you said you were
feeling lucky.

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:38.309
I see you still do.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.143
Jump in, man.
Join the fun.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.149
No, I'm leaving.
I went broke.

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.412
Here you go.
Grubstake.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:44.475
Oh, thank you.

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.384
New shooter,
get your bets down.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.389
Bet the 7-11, any crap.

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.089
Seven.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.029
All right.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.300
Put her on the pot.

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:06.930
Go get it.
Yeah.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.774
Paying good shooter
coming out.

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:16.479
$50,000.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:19.886
I'm sorry, sir,
the table limit is $20,000.

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:23.049
It's all right.
His credit's good.

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:29.395
Sir, you've got a bet.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.470
$50,000 they do pass.

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:38.666
$50,000,

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:42.542
they don't.

01:09:49.984 --> 01:09:51.350
Snake eyes!

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.719
You saw that?

01:09:57.893 --> 01:10:00.589
Did you see that?
Dynamite! All right!

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.170
Haven't you ever
heard that old adage:

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.228
"Never bet against a winner?"

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.307
In the end you will lose.

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.365
In the end
you're gonna be mine.

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:16.444
Now it's time
to cash in, huh?

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:18.275
Say hi to your mom.

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.154
We did it, buddy!

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.696
He took the bait.
We hooked him real good.

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:36.958
My, he does look upset.

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.697
A little more bait
and I think we got him.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.097
I certainly hope

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:13.759
your hook is big enough
to hold him.

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:16.337
I got a little extra help
in that department.

01:11:25.547 --> 01:11:27.344
Surely he doesn't plan
to ram us.

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:29.475
I don't think
he's planning right now, KITT.

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.542
He just wants to
get his hands on me.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:36.090
Let's lock the steering wheel
in position.

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:51.267
What's the meaning of this?

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.706
I'll take that.
Hello, Garthe.

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.344
This is kidnapping.

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.776
A relative term.

01:11:57.846 --> 01:11:59.245
Under the circumstances,

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:02.079
I believe your late father
would have approved.

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:04.152
Won't you come this way?

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:42.486
Keep an eye on things, buddy.
I may need you.

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.617
Be careful, Michael.

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:58.998
Hello, Mr. Knight,
how are you?

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:00.803
Hello, Joe, how you doing?

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.604
Couldn't be better.
Great.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.417
Garthe!

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:20.291
Rita, it's me.
It's Michael Knight.

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:23.195
Michael. What are you doing?
Why are you here?

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:25.699
Garthe's penthouse is empty.
Where is everybody?

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:26.859
They've gone.

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.301
Tsombe refused to wait
for Garthe any longer.

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.429
What's going on?

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.439
Where'd they go?
Did they say?

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:33.998
Some place called Dry Lake.

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.576
Michael, what are you doing?

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:38.441
I can't leave you here now.
I've got a feeling

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:41.415
you'll never get out
of Clark County alive.

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.680
As you can see,
my dear Elizabeth,

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:52.022
my driver
believes in punctuality.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.618
Garthe will be here.

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:56.220
If not,
we will proceed without him.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.264
I have tried
to talk to him,

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:02.269
impress upon him
the urgency of our mission.

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:04.769
And now,
with less than an hour to go,

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.570
he is like a man possessed
by the devil himself,

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:10.840
chasing fantasy enemies
in the desert.

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:13.506
Now I want to tell you
something, Tsombe Kuna,

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.641
great leader of the masses.

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.742
This great venture
was not conceived

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.118
by small men with small minds,

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.189
who live by the clock.

01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:24.791
It was conceived
by my son and I.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.727
It was borne with passion,
not punctuality.

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.127
If it comes to that,

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:33.401
let your drivers drive,
your soldiers shoot.

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:42.608
My son and I will triumph
in the end.

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:48.646
Anything more from Michael?

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:51.345
He and Rita are
on their way to Dry Lake.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.320
He shouldn't have
involved her.

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:55.413
He said she wouldn't be safe
at the hotel.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.949
I told him we'd get as close
as we could and stand by.

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:01.389
I'd better check on our guest.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.660
Devon!

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.719
Garthe, you know
you can't get away with this!

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.685
Let me out of here!

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:30.753
Garthe!

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:38.421
Garthe!

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:21.473
Rita, you were
leaving the hotel.

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:23.738
What? Yeah.

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:25.941
Why?

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:27.876
I couldn't stand it
any longer.

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.611
I thought I could,

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:32.845
but every time
he touched me, I-I...

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.590
He's dead, you know.

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:44.798
Ron. Garthe told me.

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:47.593
He killed him.

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.227
And then he came
and told me about it

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.101
like he had
nothing to do with it.

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:53.869
Like he read about it
in the newspaper.

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.774
I'm sorry.

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:00.010
I was really hoping
he'd show up.

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:01.446
So was I.

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:04.849
If we ever get out
of this alive,

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.785
I just feel like
going home and-

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:09.187
I thought you said

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:11.919
Ron had his heart set
on a gold record.

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:14.187
He did.
Okay.

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:15.820
Michael, I'm getting a reading

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:17.330
about a mile
further down the road.

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:18.525
All right, what you got?

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.296
People, an RV,
a large plane, and...

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.895
Michael! That brute,

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:26.566
that miserable
mechanical masher,

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:28.142
he's there, too.

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:30.336
Three-to-one
he won't brutalize me again.

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:31.401
Four-to-one.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.845
Okay, pal.

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.746
We're on.

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:44.348
I don't know
what's gonna happen out here.

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:46.587
I've come this far.
I'm not gonna turn back now.

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:49.688
All right, can you promise me
you'll stay in the car?

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:52.359
Now, KITT can darken the
windows. You'll be perfectly safe.

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:53.458
What about you?

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:54.592
Hey.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:58.564
I'm Garthe Knight, remember?
I fear no man.

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.339
Garthe, how nice of you
to join us.

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:38.675
You didn't think I'd miss my
greatest moment, did you, Mother dear?

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:41.341
The great revolutionary
was beginning to worry.

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.611
I trust
your personal vendettas

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:45.619
have been satisfied at last.

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.848
My vendettas,
personal or otherwise,

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.517
have nothing to do
with our agreement.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.792
The Knight Industry
Two Thousand,

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:55.659
will be a memento
of my ultimate triumph.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.861
I trust everything is ready.

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:00.060
My commandos
are on their way.

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:03.365
I need five minutes
for a final check on Goliath.

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:10.801
Now all he has to do
is plant the explosive.

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.410
He's almost there, KITT.

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.148
I wish he'd hurry.

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:24.791
Michael, there's a car coming.
It's Garthe.

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.008
We meet again.

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:04.097
I'm pleased you'll be here

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.293
to witness
my penultimate glory.

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:09.393
You know, it's people like you
who give revolutions a bad name.

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:13.065
This isn't a revolution,
it's a personal conquest.

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:15.171
That's what I mean.

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:16.801
Ah, a man of principle.

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:19.608
Abel to my Cain, my brother.

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:22.916
I look forward to sharing
so many things with you.

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.077
After all,
we have so much in common.

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:28.816
Our surname,
our faces, my father.

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.824
Why not our future?

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.519
What's that supposed to mean?

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:36.086
Upon completion of my mission
I'm returning to Africa.

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:38.332
You're coming with me.

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.558
Garthe,
you're out of your mind.

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.569
No, but you may be.

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:46.073
You see, African prisons can
have that effect on a man's mind.

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:47.198
Prison?

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:51.302
Precisely. The same hellhole
I was subjected to,

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:54.041
while my father
turned his back on me,

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:57.607
and gave you everything
that was rightfully mine.

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:11.657
Michael.

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:14.133
Michael, there must be
something we can do.

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:16.101
Just hang tight, KITT.

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:19.337
And don't let Rita
out of the car.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.740
KITT, he seems so calm.

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.209
Does he have a plan?

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:25.041
I certainly hope so.

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.251
Relax.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.686
You are about to witness
a moment

01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:42.696
that will change
the course of human history.

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:45.460
Not to mention
a few personal fortunes.

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:52.371
Left turn!

01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:46.284
There's really no excuse.

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.456
If anything
happens to Michael,

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:51.897
I'll hold myself
personally responsible.

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.297
Who are you phoning?

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:00.067
Gen. Maddux at SAC.

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:02.672
But, Devon,
he didn't listen before.

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:03.904
Why would he listen now?

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.503
Because this time
I'm telling him,

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.445
I'm driving
straight into Red Bluff.

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:09.210
And I'm going to dare him
to stop me.

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:48.327
I told you!
I told you he could do it.

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:49.556
Yeah.

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.224
Yeah.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.592
Get ready, buddy.

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:59.531
Hold on, Rita.
This could be a bit bumpy.

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:04.838
Okay, KITT. Now.

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:33.571
Are you all right?

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:36.235
I will be as soon as
I get rid of these handcuffs.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.142
Right away, Michael.

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:41.939
Hey.

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.347
Good work, buddy.

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:45.079
Dare I ask
where we're headed?

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.780
Got to find Garthe, pal.

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:49.584
We're the last thing between
him and a plane to Africa.

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:51.921
But, Michael, he's got
Goliath. You can't stop him.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.824
Yeah, we got to try.

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.188
KITT.

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:58.060
The laser power pack
April installed,

01:28:58.132 --> 01:28:59.497
how much juice
we got left?

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:02.468
Michael, surely you're not
thinking of using it as a weapon.

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:05.198
If I can adapt it,
it's worth a try. Take over.

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:07.741
Michael, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:08.776
No.

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:11.640
Is there anything I can do
to help? Like drive?

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:12.737
Here.

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:13.803
Ouch.

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.940
Hold this. Sorry.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:20.913
Speaking of Goliath,
I'm picking up

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:23.889
something extremely large
and fast at 2:00.

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:28.557
KITT, you said you were doing
an analysis on Goliath.

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:30.096
What did you come up with?

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:32.064
My comprehensive
configuration analysis

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:35.261
indicates a potential weak spot
in the Molecular Bonded Shell

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.635
at the point where the tractor
and trailer connect.

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:51.150
Michael,
he's coming right for us!

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.148
All right, give it to me.

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:31.449
He's got another rocket,
Michael.

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:33.426
And a payload of commandos
in the trailer.

01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:36.190
That's okay. We got our laser.

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:46.069
Okay, let's seal
those commandos in.

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:59.011
KITT, how big
is that weak spot

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:01.418
where the trailer
and tractor connect?

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:03.251
No larger than a quarter.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:06.920
Even David had a bigger target
when he went after Goliath.

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:10.329
Okay, pal,
let's not miss this one.

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:34.988
He's coming after us again.

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:36.990
That's how snakes are.

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:39.390
You can cut off their head
but they still bite.

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.291
He's got one more rocket,
Michael.

01:31:41.362 --> 01:31:44.388
We've got one more laser.
That's a fair fight.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.026
Michael, he's about to fire.

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:51.434
All right.

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:54.066
I want you to wait
as long as we can,

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:56.139
then give me
everything you've got.

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:58.576
We got to take out
that rocket.

01:32:02.917 --> 01:32:05.044
Michael, please hurry.

01:32:07.588 --> 01:32:08.646
Now!

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:17.013
I have a feeling that
no one's going to be seeing

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.558
very much of Garthe Knight

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:20.594
for some considerable
time to come.

01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:23.027
No one on the outside,
at least.

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.764
What about Elizabeth?

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:26.595
I suspect she'll get
what she deserves.

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:29.761
My, she was a wonderful woman
once upon a time.

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:32.900
You know, we owe you
and Ron an awful lot.

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:36.340
Oh, thanks. But it's really
Ron who deserves the credit.

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.646
Ron and The Foundation.

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.542
Well.

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:43.912
Bye-bye.

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:45.418
I'll see you.

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:48.746
Hey, listen, if you're
ever in Los Angeles-

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:51.155
I'll look for your picture
on a billboard on Sunset.

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:54.021
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.255
Okay. Take care.

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:56.626
Okay. You, too.

01:33:57.498 --> 01:33:59.728
It's straight ahead.

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.339
Oh, what's that?

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:10.036
This is my cashier's check.

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:11.974
For my winnings
at the crap table.

01:34:12.046 --> 01:34:13.980
Uh, too bad
it has to be returned.

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:16.744
Yes. You were on
Foundation business, Michael,

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:18.978
sponsored by
Foundation funds.

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:21.453
Coordinated by
Foundation equipment

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:23.422
and Foundation intelligence.

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:25.823
Yeah, well, I-I-I think
10 percent is fair.

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:27.360
10 percent of that.

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:28.827
Uh, 8 percent?

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.921
Okay-okay, 5 percent.
That's it.

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:33.296
By the way, Michael,
we'll expect you in the office

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.629
first thing in the morning,

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:36.225
and, uh, good work,
Michael.

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:37.702
3 percent?

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:41.504
Okay, 2 percent. A roll of
quarters for the slot machines!

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.376
Out of here!

01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:47.480
Michael, I've been thinking

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:49.345
about the whole
phenomenon of gambling.

01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:51.408
You were right.
It's all odds.

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:53.385
It's actually
rather intriguing.

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:55.684
Well, sure, if you've got
money and a system.

01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:59.214
All I have is $413 you owe me
from computer blackjack.

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:00.225
Hmm.

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:02.852
But I have devised
a rather innovative system.

01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:05.593
I estimate an average return
on investment

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:08.032
of 67.3 percent.

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:10.228
67?

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:13.329
That's not bad, buddy.

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:16.171
Yes. And all one needs
to begin is $20.

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:19.906
$20? That's it? I got it.

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:22.577
I've got $20 here somewhere.

01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:24.650
You know...

01:35:24.785 --> 01:35:27.151
Hey, lucky. Where to next?

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:28.552
You name it, pard.

01:35:28.622 --> 01:35:30.749
Roulette, blackjack, craps.

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:32.883
Hey, lucky, you're my man.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.222
Oh, no.

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:35.589
You're the king.

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:37.062
Not again.

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:40.562
Where you going?
Come on back.

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:42.363
See ya.
Hey, lucky.

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.629
Hey, lucky, come on back.
