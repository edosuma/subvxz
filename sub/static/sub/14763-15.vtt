I don't know, Tony.

00:43.978 --> 00:47.312
Your cousin's making
a convincing case for being
number one metal head.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.248
That's okay, Falcon,
I called in a friend

00:49.250 --> 00:51.417
to help make
a counter argument.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.285
FALCON: The Vision.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.855
Didn't expect
to see you today.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.891
I did not expect your call.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.759
I've been monitoring
global threats

01:00.761 --> 01:03.095
from a super computer center
in Norway.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.930
But I'm happy to come
to your assistance.

01:09.869 --> 01:14.073
Iron Man, by what criteria
do you designate me a friend?

01:16.276 --> 01:19.278
Explanation of human emotions
later, Vision.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.547
I scanned Cobalt Man
to see who we're dealing with

01:21.549 --> 01:24.049
and it turns out
he's all robot.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.885
Making me the undisputed
metal guy champ.

01:26.887 --> 01:30.255
Now, let's box in wannabe me.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.192
Plotting a complementary
optic beam firing pattern.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.461
Uh, yeah.
Do that.

01:46.139 --> 01:47.639
Close the box.

01:51.711 --> 01:53.445
And he's out.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.114
That teleporter's nice though.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.050
So nice, I'm gonna
hack it for myself.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.660
Hulk's strength assessment
was accurate.

02:08.662 --> 02:12.831
A 424% increase
in density was necessary
to counter that blow.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.968
Plus 100 strength is required
to generate such force.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.572
Low density and tangibility
is a more practical option.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.078
We'll geek out
on science later, Vision.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.080
I'm picking up
a strange signature.

02:28.082 --> 02:30.282
Might be Ultron's
but I can't get a full reading

02:30.284 --> 02:32.584
with Cobalt Man
playing peek-a-boo.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.257
When did you robots
get so strong?

02:38.259 --> 02:40.259
I am not a robot.
I am a synthezoid.

Friends don't let friends
get lasered.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.839
Oh, is that a rule
of friendship?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.307
I find the topic fascinating.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.976
I'd very much like
to experience friendship.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.312
Hmm. Good luck with that.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.647
Sorry to break up
the greeting card,

03:01.649 --> 03:04.550
but our metallic pal

detonates, the better.

I pinpointed the location of
the teleportation device.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.844
I've also devised an algorithm

04:05.846 --> 04:08.614
to predict Cobalt Man's
teleportation pattern.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.285
Math attack.
I love this guy.

04:13.287 --> 04:16.454
Send me the specs.
Vision and I will target

I did. This is my design.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.609
Hulk, why are you breaking
more stuff than usual today?

13:31.611 --> 13:32.977
Where's Thor?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.612
FRIDAY: <i> He went to Asgard</i>
<i>with Vision.</i>

13:34.614 --> 13:37.515
He did?
I mean, of course he did.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.951
'Cause I'm meeting them there.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.820
Please go.
I already had to send

13:41.822 --> 13:45.523
Cobalt Man's teleporter
to the other lab today
because of you.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.959
I don't wanna
lose anything else.

13:47.961 --> 13:48.860
Mmm...

13:51.931 --> 13:56.601
Ultron can only attack
one target at a time
with the Warlock's Eye.

13:56.603 --> 14:00.939
Charging it once
on separate paths
will split his focus.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.674
Ready?
Ready.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.848
Vision!

14:10.950 --> 14:12.250
(GRUNTS)
Vision!

14:12.685 --> 14:15.053
(GRUNTS)

14:19.692 --> 14:21.392
Your strategy was sound.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.963
With Ultron distracted,
I was able
to approach undetected.

14:26.398 --> 14:28.066
Did I do something wrong?

14:28.068 --> 14:31.970
(SIGHS) You abandoned
a friend mid-fight.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.105
The first rule
of teamwork is...

14:37.743 --> 14:40.078
You dare attack me?

14:40.080 --> 14:42.380
(YELLS)
Ultron.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.317
Within the Dwarven
ax Jarnbjorn?

14:46.319 --> 14:49.187
And the Valkyrie sword
Dragonfang?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.789
Yes. He's on the move.

15:02.701 --> 15:06.004
Who knows if any of this junk
can get me to Asgard?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.842
By the power of Thor,

15:10.844 --> 15:13.077
but Hulk instead of Thor,

15:13.079 --> 15:16.080
take me to Asgard!

15:18.250 --> 15:21.452
(SIGHS) Friday, can you open
a portal to Asgard?

15:21.454 --> 15:24.022
Or a bridge?
Either one?

15:24.024 --> 15:26.124
FRIDAY: <i> I'm afraid not, Hulk.</i>

15:26.126 --> 15:28.760
Please? Help a Hulk out.

15:31.463 --> 15:35.300
Oh! Thanks, Friday.
I owe you some apps.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.869
FRIDAY: <i> It wasn't me.</i>

15:37.871 --> 15:40.371
ULTRON: No. It was me.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.609
You're next.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.711
(GROWLS)

15:48.047 --> 15:50.648
Ultron, what did you do
to them?

15:50.650 --> 15:53.117
They'll live... For now.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.386
You won't be so lucky.

15:55.388 --> 15:59.657
Now that I have found
an indestructible,
unstoppable body,

15:59.659 --> 16:02.794
you don't know
how wrong you are.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.630
(GROWLING)

16:05.632 --> 16:06.998
(GRUNTING)

16:07.000 --> 16:08.333
(YELLS)

16:09.468 --> 16:11.135
(GROWLS)

16:11.403 --> 16:13.137
(ROARS)

16:13.772 --> 16:15.740
Flesh and blood.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.609
How did you
ever make it this far?

16:18.611 --> 16:20.712
(GRUNTING)

16:23.816 --> 16:25.316
(GROANS)

16:25.318 --> 16:27.418
Thought I could hit hard.

16:29.121 --> 16:32.523
(ALARM BLARING)

16:32.525 --> 16:34.993
Hulk, what's going...
The Destroyer Armor.

16:34.995 --> 16:39.130
Yes. But I'm much more
than just the armor.

16:39.132 --> 16:42.700
(GROANS)
Must alert the Avengers.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.936
They appear to
already know.

16:44.938 --> 16:48.973
Yep. That's Ultron's voice.
And he's been working out.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.009
FRIDAY: <i> Ultron has</i>
<i>infiltrated the system.</i>

16:51.011 --> 16:52.643
<i>He's trying to take</i>
(DISTORTED) <i> control...</i>

16:52.645 --> 16:56.481
Friday is inferior
and expendable,

16:56.483 --> 16:59.017
just like the rest of you.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.136
The Destroyer Armor
is impenetrable.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.070
No one gets inside.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.915
Thor is right.
This body is nearly perfect,

17:30.917 --> 17:32.917
unlike Vision's body.

17:32.919 --> 17:36.087
Can't move. Energy surge
compromised mobility.

17:36.089 --> 17:40.391
ULTRON: All it lacks
is the Cobalt Man
teleportation technology.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.062
Will you forfeit it
to save Vision's life?

17:44.064 --> 17:45.263
Deal.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.665
No. The risk is too high.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.035
Interesting.
You value a life,

17:51.037 --> 17:54.672
a synthetic life,
enough to concede?

17:54.674 --> 17:58.009
Of course.
But the teleporter's
not here.

17:58.011 --> 18:01.279
So, you release Vision,
we'll go get it for you.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.749
No need. I've located it
in your system.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.118
I will retrieve it myself.
(BEEPING)

18:07.120 --> 18:09.153
It's not as if
you will stop me.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.893
Stop him before
he gets to the lab.

18:15.895 --> 18:19.730
Your so-called friendship
makes you weak.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.733
That is why
you will fall before me.

18:22.735 --> 18:28.106
That is why your existence
will soon be a memory.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.244
You will advance no further.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.447
Your journey is
at an end, Ultron.

18:40.119 --> 18:44.288
Not before I claim my prize.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.057
(GROANS)

18:46.959 --> 18:48.292
(GROWLS)

18:48.727 --> 18:50.161
(ROARING)

18:51.797 --> 18:54.132
Thor is my friend!

18:56.335 --> 18:57.869
How quaint.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.804
(GROWLS)

19:04.143 --> 19:07.011
You will be
the first to fall, Thor,

19:07.013 --> 19:09.580
but not the last.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.151
THOR: Vision!

19:16.788 --> 19:18.523
VISION: You won't
fall today, friend.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.992
And thank you
for the lightning reboot.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.163
My updated
security protocols

19:25.165 --> 19:27.665
will repel your incursion
efforts, Ultron.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.701
ULTRON: You ally yourself
with such flawed beings?

19:30.703 --> 19:33.137
You deserve to share
their fate.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.806
VISION: Their flaws
distinguish them from us.

19:35.808 --> 19:39.477
It is why
they must endure and why
you must be destroyed.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.879
ULTRON: You've locked
the Destroyer controls.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.982
What is this?
What are you doing?

19:44.984 --> 19:47.485
VISION: We are headed
for a deep-sea trench.

19:47.487 --> 19:52.390
I will leave you there,
entombed under the ocean
for all eternity.

19:52.392 --> 19:56.460
ULTRON: You're mad.
At that depth, you'll never
survive the return trip.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.362
VISION: You may be right,
but I'm willing to

19:58.364 --> 20:00.464
sacrifice myself
to stop you.

20:00.466 --> 20:03.134
My friends would do
the same for me.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.671
Good-bye, Ultron.

20:06.673 --> 20:10.141
ULTRON: (ECHOING) No!

20:19.585 --> 20:22.119
You will not fall today,
friend.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.494
I boosted
the scan's power tenfold.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.330
I'm not picking up
any signs of Ultron.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.399
But are you sure it's safe
to just leave him?

20:35.401 --> 20:36.867
I fused the Destroyer systems

20:36.869 --> 20:39.103
and left Ultron
unable to move.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.871
With no tech nearby
for him to control

20:40.873 --> 20:42.440
at the bottom of the ocean,

20:42.442 --> 20:45.343
yes, I believe Ultron
is safely imprisoned.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.211
If you believe
this is the best way

20:47.213 --> 20:48.779
to dispose of Ultron,

20:48.781 --> 20:51.315
then we trust you, friend.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.532
(VIDEO GAME MUSIC PLAYING)

21:08.534 --> 21:10.868
THOR: There were many acts
of valor today,

21:10.870 --> 21:14.438
but it was your sacrifice,
Vision, that stopped Ultron.

21:14.440 --> 21:18.042
That was an act
of true friendship.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.878
(GROANS)

21:20.880 --> 21:25.116
Yeah. Sweet sacrifice, Viz.
