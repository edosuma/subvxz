00:12.721 --> 00:17.022
Sneed and Company
offer their sincerest condolences, sir,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.977
in this most trying hour.

00:21.104 --> 00:24.153
Grandmama had a good
innings, Mr Sneed.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.322
She was so full of life,

00:27.277 --> 00:28.654
I can't believe she's gone.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.705
Not gone, Mr Redpath, sir.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.533
Merely sleeping.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.129
May I have a moment?

00:38.205 --> 00:39.878
Yes, of course.

00:39.957 --> 00:43.632
I shall be in the next room
should you require anything.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.041
Oh, no!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.326
No!

01:21.999 --> 01:23.046
Gwyneth!

01:23.125 --> 01:26.049
Get down here now!
We've got another one!

02:31.902 --> 02:32.949
Hold that one down!

02:33.070 --> 02:34.162
I'm holding this one down!

02:34.237 --> 02:35.580
Well, hold them both down!

02:36.031 --> 02:37.032
It's not gonna work.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.493
Oi! I promised you
a time machine, and that's what you get.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.920
Now, we've seen the future,
let's have a look at the past.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.085
1860!
How does 1860 sound?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.290
What happened in 1860?

02:45.374 --> 02:47.968
I don't know, let's find out!
Hold on, here we go!

02:56.176 --> 02:57.928
Gwyneth!

02:58.762 --> 03:00.230
Where are you, girl?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.937
Gwyneth!

03:03.725 --> 03:06.319
- Where've you been? I was shouting.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.989
Been in the stable, sir,
breaking the ice for Samson.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.196
Well, get back in there
and harness him up!

03:11.775 --> 03:13.118
Whatever for, sir?

03:13.235 --> 03:15.579
The stiffs are
getting lively again.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.123
Mr Redpath's grandmother,
she's up and on her feet,

03:18.240 --> 03:21.289
and out there somewhere,
on the streets, we've got to find her.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.293
Mr Sneed, for shame,
how many more times? It's ungodly!

03:25.455 --> 03:27.457
Don't look at me
like it's my fault.

03:27.541 --> 03:31.637
Now, come on. Hurry up!
She was 86. She can't have got far.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.135
What about Mr Redpath?
Did you deal with him?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.809
No.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.473
She did.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.889
That's awful, sir.

03:43.473 --> 03:48.229
I know it's not my place, and please
forgive me for talking out of turn, sir.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.691
But this is getting beyond now.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.784
Something terrible is happening in this
house, and we've got to get help.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.456
And we will.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.831
As soon as I get that dead old woman locked
up, and safe and sound.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.582
Now, stop prevaricating, girl.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.540
Get the hearse ready.
We're going bodysnatching.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.894
- Blimey!
- Telling me! You all right?

04:25.015 --> 04:27.518
Yeah, I think so.
Nothing broken.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.069
Did we make it? Where are we?

04:29.144 --> 04:30.396
I did it!
Give the man a medal.

04:30.479 --> 04:34.529
Earth, Naples,
December 24th, 1860.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.449
That's so weird.
It's Christmas.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.201
All yours.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.501
But it's like...
Think about it, though.

04:44.576 --> 04:49.173
Christmas, 1860,
happens once, just once,

04:49.247 --> 04:53.673
and then it's gone,
it's finished, it'll never happen again.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.848
Except for you.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.597
You can go back and see
days that are dead and gone.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.928
A hundred thousand sunsets ago.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.314
No wonder you never stay still.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.233
Not a bad life.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.354
Better with two.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.815
Come on then!

05:14.898 --> 05:16.275
Oi, oi, oi!
Where do you think you're going?

05:16.608 --> 05:17.734
1860.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.819
Go out there dressed like that,

05:18.902 --> 05:20.142
you'll start a riot,
Barbarella.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.409
There's a wardrobe
through there,

05:21.488 --> 05:23.707
first left, second right,
third on the left, go straight ahead,

05:23.782 --> 05:26.423
under the stairs, past the bins, fifth
door on your left. Hurry up!

05:32.916 --> 05:35.590
Not a sign.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.174
Where is she?

05:37.546 --> 05:39.924
She's vanished
into the ether, sir. Where can she be?

05:45.262 --> 05:46.889
You tell me, girl.

05:47.639 --> 05:48.856
What do you mean?

05:48.932 --> 05:51.105
Gwyneth, you know full well.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.276
No, sir, I can't.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.067
Use the sight.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.277
It's not right, sir.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.493
Find the old lady
or you're dismissed.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.904
Now.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.206
Look inside, girl.

06:04.281 --> 06:07.410
Look deep.
Where is she?

06:12.414 --> 06:13.916
She's lost, sir.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.794
She's so alone.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.178
Oh, my Lord.
So many strange things in her head.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.428
But where?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.019
She is excited.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.437
About tonight.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.476
Before she passed on,
she was going to see him.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.686
- Who's him?
- The great man.

06:35.145 --> 06:39.696
All the way from London,
the great, great man.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.990
Mr Dickens? Mr Dickens?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.830
Excuse me, sir,
Mr Dickens, this is your call.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.001
Are you quite well, sir?

06:50.076 --> 06:53.205
Splendid. Splendid. Sorry!

06:53.413 --> 06:54.790
Time you were on, sir.

06:54.873 --> 06:59.003
Absolutely.
I was just brooding...

06:59.961 --> 07:04.091
Christmas Eve.
Not the best of times to be alone.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.471
Did no one
travel with you, sir?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.678
No lady wife waiting out front?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.104
I'm afraid not.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.811
You can have mine if you want.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.312
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

07:14.100 --> 07:19.277
I've, I've been rather,
let's say, clumsy, with family matters.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.779
Thank God I'm too old
to cause any more trouble.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.239
You speak as if
it's all over, sir.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.832
Oh, it's never over!

07:30.992 --> 07:33.370
On and on I go.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.211
The same old show.

07:36.456 --> 07:43.135
I'm like a ghost, condemned
to repeat myself through all eternity.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.390
It's never too late, sir,
you could always think up some new turns.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.639
No, I can't.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.892
Even my imagination
grows stale.

07:55.058 --> 07:59.734
I'm an old man, perhaps I've thought
everything I'll ever think.

08:01.022 --> 08:06.119
Still. The lure of
the limelight's as potent as a pipe, eh?

08:13.368 --> 08:15.086
On with the motley.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.299
- Blimey!
- Don't laugh.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.263
You look beautiful.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.764
- Considering.
- Considering what?

08:34.264 --> 08:36.392
That you're human.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.857
I think that's a compliment.
Aren't you gonna change?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.938
I've changed my jumper!
Come on.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.821
You stay there,
you've done this before.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.276
This is mine.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.889
Ready for this?

09:10.341 --> 09:12.639
Here we go.
History.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.562
She's in there, sir,
I'm certain of it.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.939
Right.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.029
I got the flight a bit wrong.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.739
- I don't care.
- It's not 1860, it's 1869.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.494
- I don't care.
- And it's not Naples.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.122
- I don't care.
- It's Cardiff.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.379
Right.

10:23.248 --> 10:28.254
Now, it is a fact
that there was nothing particular at all

10:28.378 --> 10:31.348
about the knocker
on the door of this house.

10:31.422 --> 10:35.518
But let any man
explain to me, if he can,

10:35.593 --> 10:41.521
how it happened that Scrooge
having his key in the lock of the door,

10:41.599 --> 10:44.022
saw in the knocker,

10:44.102 --> 10:49.404
without it undergoing
any intermediate process of change,

10:50.316 --> 10:54.446
not a knocker,
but Marley's face!

10:56.072 --> 10:58.074
Marley's face!

10:59.492 --> 11:03.747
It looked at Scrooge

11:04.247 --> 11:08.468
as Marley used to look.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.466
It looked like...

11:13.381 --> 11:15.850
Oh, my Lord...

11:15.925 --> 11:20.431
It looked like that!

11:23.474 --> 11:26.819
What phantasmagoria is this?

11:37.405 --> 11:38.873
That's more like it.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.962
Stay in your seats,
I, I beg you!

11:44.037 --> 11:47.962
It is a lantern show, trickery!

11:50.877 --> 11:52.174
There she is, sir!

11:53.296 --> 11:54.639
I can see that!

11:56.966 --> 12:00.345
Whole bloomin' world
can see that!

12:09.938 --> 12:11.155
Fantastic!

12:17.612 --> 12:18.704
Did you see where it came from?

12:18.780 --> 12:21.158
The wag reveals
himself, does he?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.664
I trust you're satisfied, sir!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.795
Oi! Leave her alone.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.419
- Doctor! I'll get them.
- Be careful!

12:28.498 --> 12:31.627
Did it say anything?
Can it speak? I'm the Doctor, by the way.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.920
Doctor? You look
more like a navvy.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.505
What's wrong with this jumper?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.593
- What are you doing?
- Oh! It's a tragedy, miss.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.678
Don't worry yourself,
me and the master will deal with it.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.105
Fact is, this poor lady
has been taken with a brain fever.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.898
We have to get her
to the infirmary.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.402
She's cold. She's dead.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.104
Oh, my God,
what did you do to her?

13:00.989 --> 13:03.868
- What did you do that for?
- She's seen too much!

13:03.950 --> 13:05.918
Get her in the hearse! Legs!

13:10.206 --> 13:11.423
Gas.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.001
It's made of gas.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.436
Rose! You're not
escaping me, sir!

13:26.889 --> 13:28.857
What do you know about
that hob-goblin? Hmm?

13:30.727 --> 13:34.027
Projection on glass,
I suppose. Who put you up to it?

13:34.105 --> 13:35.652
Yeah, mate, not now, thanks.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.951
Oi! You! Follow that hearse!

13:38.026 --> 13:39.699
- Can't do that, sir.
- Why not?

13:39.777 --> 13:42.405
I'll tell you why not.
I'll give you a very good reason why not.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.123
Because this is my coach.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.700
Well, get in, then!

13:47.535 --> 13:48.536
Move!

13:50.538 --> 13:53.166
- Come on! You're losing them!
- Everything in order, Mr Dickens?

13:53.374 --> 13:55.468
- No, it is not!
- What did he say?

13:55.543 --> 13:58.171
Let me say this first.
I am not without a sense of humour...

13:58.254 --> 14:01.178
- Dickens? Charles Dickens?
- Yes.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.884
- Yes!
- The Charles Dickens?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.435
Should I remove
the gentleman, sir?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.475
Charles Dickens!
You're brilliant, you are!

14:06.596 --> 14:08.644
Completely 100% brilliant.
I've read them all.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.483
Great Expectations.
Oliver Twist...

14:10.600 --> 14:13.649
- What's the other one, the one with the ghost?
Christmas Carol?

14:13.728 --> 14:16.948
No, the one with the trains.
The Signal-Man, that's it. Terrifying!

14:17.190 --> 14:18.863
The best short story
ever written!

14:18.941 --> 14:22.115
- You're a genius.
- Do you want me to get rid of him, sir?

14:22.278 --> 14:23.871
Uh, no, I think he can stay.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.916
Honestly, Charles...
Can I call you Charles? I'm such a big fan.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.164
Uh, you're a what?
A big what?

14:29.327 --> 14:31.204
Fan. Number one fan,
that's me!

14:31.954 --> 14:33.627
How exactly are you a "fan"?

14:33.748 --> 14:36.718
In what way do you
resemble a means of keeping oneself cool?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.512
No, it means fanatic.
Devoted to. Mind you, I've gotta say,

14:39.587 --> 14:42.215
that American bit in
Martin Chuzzlewit, what's that about?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.721
Was that just padding or what?
I mean it's rubbish, that bit.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.303
I thought you said
you were my fan.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.514
Oh, well,
if you can't take criticism...

14:48.638 --> 14:50.982
Do the death of Little Nell.
It cracks me up. No! Sorry!

14:51.057 --> 14:52.650
Forget about that.
Come on! Faster!

14:56.813 --> 14:58.815
Who exactly is in that hearse?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.900
My friend. She's only 19.
It's my fault.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.656
She's in my care,
and now she's in danger.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.246
Why are we wasting my time
talking about dry old books?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.540
This is much more
important. Driver!

15:07.615 --> 15:09.993
- Be swift! The chase is on!
- Yes, sir!

15:10.326 --> 15:12.545
- Attaboy, Charlie.
- Nobody calls me Charlie.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.585
- The ladies do.
- How do you know that?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.836
I told you!
I'm your number one...

15:15.915 --> 15:17.758
Number one fan. I know.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.594
The poor girl's
still alive, sir,

15:23.673 --> 15:25.141
what are we going to
do with her?

15:25.216 --> 15:26.468
I don't know!

15:26.926 --> 15:29.054
I didn't plan
any of this, did I?

15:29.679 --> 15:32.023
Is it my fault
if the dead won't stay dead?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.434
Then whose fault is it, sir?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.898
Why is this happening to us?

15:50.199 --> 15:52.668
I did the Bishop a favour once.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.620
Made his nephew
look like a cherub

15:54.704 --> 15:57.048
even though he'd been
a fortnight in the weir.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.795
Hey, perhaps he'll do us
an exorcism on the cheap!

16:02.712 --> 16:05.010
Say I'm not in.
Tell 'em we're closed.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.716
Just, just, get rid of 'em.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.735
I'm sorry, sir. We're closed.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.579
Nonsense. Since when
did an Undertaker keep office hours?

16:28.654 --> 16:31.783
The dead don't die
on schedule, I demand to see your master.

16:31.866 --> 16:32.958
He's not in, sir.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.086
Don't lie to me, child,
summon the master!

16:36.954 --> 16:39.924
I'm awfully sorry, Mr Dickens,
but the master is indisposed.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.217
Having trouble with your gas?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.379
What the Shakespeare
is going on?

16:53.054 --> 16:54.055
Are you all right?

16:57.517 --> 17:00.191
You're kidding me, yeah?
You're just kidding.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.192
You are kidding me, aren't you?

17:02.647 --> 17:04.115
Okay, not kidding.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.079
You're not allowed inside, sir.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.039
There's something
inside the walls.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.212
The gas pipes.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.415
Something's living
inside the gas.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.381
Let me out! Open the door!

17:28.464 --> 17:30.808
- That's her!
- Please, let me out!

17:33.427 --> 17:37.057
How dare you, sir!
This is my house.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.026
I told you...

17:40.685 --> 17:43.154
Let me out,
somebody open the door!

17:46.315 --> 17:47.988
Open the door!

17:55.324 --> 17:56.826
I think this is my dance.

17:59.203 --> 18:03.128
It's a prank. Must be.
We're under some mesmeric influence.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.754
No we're not, the dead are walking.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.087
- Hi.
- Hi. Who's your friend?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.716
Charles Dickens.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.014
- Okay.
- My name's the Doctor.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.679
Who are you, then?
What do you want?

18:12.758 --> 18:15.011
Failing! Open the rift.
We're dying.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.270
Trapped in this form.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.020
Cannot sustain. Help us.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.375
First of all you drug me,
then you kidnap me,

18:38.492 --> 18:39.664
and don't think
I didn't feel your hands

18:39.744 --> 18:41.667
having a quick wander,
you dirty old man.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.498
I won't be spoken to like this.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.379
Then you sent me
in a room full of zombies!

18:45.499 --> 18:48.628
And if that ain't enough,
you swan off and leave me to die!

18:48.711 --> 18:49.803
So come on, talk!

18:49.879 --> 18:51.722
It's not my fault,
it's this house!

18:54.216 --> 18:56.639
It always had a reputation.

18:56.719 --> 18:57.971
Haunted.

18:58.054 --> 19:02.059
But I never had much bother until about
three months back, and then the stiffs...

19:04.101 --> 19:05.899
the, um,

19:06.020 --> 19:10.366
the dear departed
started getting restless.

19:10.608 --> 19:11.609
Tommyrot!

19:11.692 --> 19:13.194
You witnessed it!

19:13.402 --> 19:15.245
Can't keep
the beggars down, sir.

19:15.613 --> 19:16.956
They walk.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.417
And it's the queerest thing,
but they hang onto scraps...

19:20.493 --> 19:22.416
Two sugars, sir,
just how you like it.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.209
One old fellow
who used to be a sexton

19:24.288 --> 19:26.791
almost walked into his
own memorial service.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.127
Just like the old lady
going to your performance, sir,

19:29.251 --> 19:30.844
just as she planned.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.014
Morbid fancy.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.716
Oh, Charles, you were there.

19:34.799 --> 19:38.178
I saw nothing but an illusion.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.185
If you're going to deny it,
don't waste my time, just shut up.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.066
What about the gas?

19:45.434 --> 19:48.187
That's new, sir.
I never seen anything like that.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.350
Means it's getting stronger,
the rift's getting wider

19:50.356 --> 19:51.949
and something's
sneaking through.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.197
- What's the rift?
- A weak point in time and space.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.449
A connection between
this place and another.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.618
That's the cause of
ghost stories, most of the time.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.908
That's howl got
the house so cheap,

20:00.991 --> 20:03.494
stories going back generations.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.631
Echoes in the dark.
Queer songs in the air.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.428
And this feeling, like a shadow

20:11.502 --> 20:13.425
passing over your soul.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.225
Mind you, truth be told,
it's been good for business,

20:17.299 --> 20:20.178
just what people expect from
a gloomy old trade like mine.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.869
Impossible!

20:54.503 --> 20:56.130
Checking for strings?

20:56.213 --> 20:58.682
Wires... perhaps.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.222
There must be some
mechanism behind this fraud.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.054
Oh, come on, Charles.

21:03.304 --> 21:07.150
All right, I shouldn't have
told you to shut up. I'm sorry.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.318
But you've got one of
the best minds in the world.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.986
You saw those gas creatures.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.062
I cannot accept that.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.657
And what does
the human body do when it decomposes?

21:14.732 --> 21:16.700
It breaks down
and produces gas.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.619
Perfect home
for these gas things.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.696
They can slip inside
and use it as a vehicle,

21:20.780 --> 21:23.533
- just like your driver and his coach.
- Stop it!

21:24.200 --> 21:28.296
Can it be that
I have the world entirely wrong?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.711
Not wrong.
There's just more to learn.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.043
I've always
railed against the fantasists!

21:33.125 --> 21:35.924
Oh, I loved an illusion
as much as the next man,

21:36.003 --> 21:38.973
revelled in them, but that's
exactly what they were, illusions.

21:39.048 --> 21:42.848
The real world
is something else.

21:43.761 --> 21:47.140
I dedicated myself to that.
Injustices,

21:47.223 --> 21:49.601
the great social causes.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.402
I hoped that
I was a force for good.

21:53.354 --> 21:57.109
Now, you tell me
that the real world

21:57.191 --> 22:01.241
is a realm of spectres
and jack-o'lanterns.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.573
In which case...

22:04.114 --> 22:07.744
Have I wasted my
brief span here, Doctor?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.205
Has it all been for nothing?

22:16.418 --> 22:18.637
Please, miss, you shouldn't
be helping, it's not right.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.257
Don't be daft.
Sneed works you to death.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.805
How much do you get paid?

22:28.597 --> 22:29.940
Eight pound a year, miss.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.984
- How much?
- I know!

22:32.101 --> 22:33.648
I would've been happy with six.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.861
So did you even
go to school, or what?

22:39.441 --> 22:42.741
Of course I did,
what do you think I am, an urchin?

22:44.238 --> 22:46.366
I went every Sunday,
nice and proper.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.288
What, once a week?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.958
We did sums and everything.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.921
To be honest,
I hated every second.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.627
Me, too!

23:01.797 --> 23:02.844
Don't tell anyone...

23:04.300 --> 23:07.850
But one week I didn't go
and I ran down the heath, all on my own.

23:07.928 --> 23:12.104
I did plenty of that. I used to go down the
shops with my mate Shareen.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.318
And we used to go
and look at boys.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.288
Well, I don't know
much about that, miss.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.693
Oh, come on,
times haven't changed that much.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.287
- I bet you've done the same.
- I don't think so, miss.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.907
Gwyneth, you can tell me.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.163
I bet you've got
your eye on someone.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.713
I suppose, there is one lad.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.506
The butcher's boy,
he comes by every Tuesday.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.179
Such a lovely smile on him.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.177
I like a nice smile.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.429
Good smile, nice bum.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.640
Well, I have never
heard the like!

23:50.679 --> 23:54.855
Ask him out. Give him a cup of
tea or something, that's a start.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.855
I swear, it's the
strangest thing, miss.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.441
You've got all the clothes
and the breeding,

24:01.523 --> 24:03.651
but you talk like
some sort of wild thing.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.363
Maybe I am.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.286
Maybe that's a good thing.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.252
You need a bit more
in your life than Mr Sneed.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.002
Oh, now, that's not fair.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.963
He's not so bad, old Sneed.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.295
He was very kind
to me to take me in

24:22.378 --> 24:24.722
because I lost
my mum and dad to the flu when I was 12.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.812
Thank you, miss.
But I'll be with them again, one day.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.685
Sitting with them in paradise.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.109
I shall be so blessed.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.898
They're waiting for me.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.235
Maybe your dad's up there
waiting for you too, miss.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.607
Maybe.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.200
Urn, who told you he was dead?

24:51.448 --> 24:53.450
I don't know,
must've been the Doctor.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.212
My father died years back.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.461
You've been thinking about
him lately. More than ever.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.043
Suppose so.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.970
How do you know all this?

25:06.296 --> 25:09.641
Mr Sneed says I think too much,

25:09.758 --> 25:11.226
I'm all alone down here.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.267
I bet you've got
dozens of servants, haven't you, miss?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.815
No, no servants where I'm from.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.608
And you've come
such a long way.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.402
What makes you think so?

25:24.606 --> 25:27.075
You're from London.

25:27.151 --> 25:30.451
I've seen London in drawings,
but never like that,

25:31.363 --> 25:34.287
all those people rushing about.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.118
Half-naked, for shame.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.296
And the noise...

25:40.622 --> 25:43.501
And the metal boxes
racing past...

25:44.877 --> 25:47.130
And the birds
in the sky... No...

25:47.212 --> 25:49.465
No, they're metal as well.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.969
Metal birds with
people in them.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.187
People are flying.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.807
And you. You've flown so far.
Further than anyone.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.860
The things you've seen.

26:02.311 --> 26:03.654
The darkness.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.615
The big bad wolf.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.237
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, miss.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.446
- It's all right.
- I can't help it.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.078
Ever since I was a little girl,
my mam said I had the sight.

26:15.157 --> 26:17.626
- She told me to hide it.
- But it's getting stronger,

26:17.701 --> 26:19.328
more powerful. Is that right?

26:21.497 --> 26:22.623
All the time, sir.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.010
Every night,

26:27.086 --> 26:28.759
voices in my head.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.932
You grew up
on top of the rift. You're part of it.

26:32.633 --> 26:33.600
You're the key.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.677
I've tried to
make sense of it, sir.

26:36.345 --> 26:39.940
Consulted with spiritualists,

26:40.015 --> 26:42.109
table-rappers, all sorts.

26:42.184 --> 26:45.028
Well, that should help.
You can show us what to do.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.523
What to do where, sir?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.488
We're going to have a seance.

26:54.404 --> 26:55.701
This is how Madam Mortlock

26:55.781 --> 26:58.409
summons those from
the Land of Mists, down in big town.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.956
- Come. We must all join hands.
- I can't take part in this.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.961
Humbug?
Come on. Open mind.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.261
This is precisely the sort of
cheap mummery I strive to unmask.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.217
Seances?

27:11.296 --> 27:14.425
Nothing but luminous
tambourines and a squeeze box

27:14.508 --> 27:18.103
concealed between
the knees. This girl knows nothing.

27:18.178 --> 27:21.102
Now, don't antagonise her.
I love a happy medium.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.475
I can't believe
you just said that.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.394
Come on. We might need you.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.074
Good man.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.111
Now, Gwyneth.
Reach out.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.083
Speak to us.

27:42.870 --> 27:43.917
Are you there?

27:44.746 --> 27:46.419
Spirits, come.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.087
Speak to us
that we may relieve your burden.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.391
Can you hear that?

27:56.466 --> 27:59.686
Nothing can happen,
this is sheer folly.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.020
Look at her.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.473
I see them!

28:03.932 --> 28:05.434
I feel them!

28:18.238 --> 28:19.205
What's it saying?

28:19.281 --> 28:20.373
It can't get through the rift.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.918
Gwyneth, it's not
controlling you, you're controlling it.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.712
- Now look deep. Allow them through.
- I can't.

28:25.787 --> 28:29.462
Yes, you can. just believe it.
I have faith in you, Gwyneth.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.460
Make the link.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.256
Yes!

28:42.679 --> 28:44.306
Great God!

28:45.682 --> 28:47.776
Spirits from the other side!

28:48.310 --> 28:50.278
The other side of the universe.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.026
Pity us!

28:52.940 --> 28:54.237
Pity the Gelth!

28:54.316 --> 28:56.489
There is so little time.
Help us!

28:56.610 --> 28:59.409
- What do you want us to do?
- The rift.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.116
Take the girl to the rift.
Make the bridge.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.416
What for?

29:03.492 --> 29:07.542
We are so very few.
The last of our kind.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.999
- We face extinction!
- Why, what happened?

29:10.582 --> 29:13.677
Once we had
a physical form, like you.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.969
But then the War came.

29:15.045 --> 29:18.299
- War? What war?
- The Time War.

29:19.508 --> 29:22.102
The whole universe convulsed.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.771
The Time War raged.

29:24.846 --> 29:28.976
In visible to smaller species
but devastating to higher forms.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.192
Our bodies wasted away.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.151
We 're trapped
in this gaseous state.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.410
So that's why you need
the corpses.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.830
We want to stand tall.

29:41.905 --> 29:45.626
To feel the sunlight.
To live again.

29:45.701 --> 29:50.127
We need a physical farm
and your dead are abandoned.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.379
The y go to waste.
Give them to us.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.631
- But we can't.
- Why not?

29:55.711 --> 29:57.884
It's not...
I mean, it's not...

29:58.005 --> 30:00.508
Not decent? Not polite?
It could save their lives.

30:00.882 --> 30:05.479
Open the rift.
Let the Gelth through.

30:05.554 --> 30:09.149
We're dying. Help us.
Pity the Gelth!

30:13.478 --> 30:14.650
Gwyneth!

30:16.857 --> 30:18.234
All true.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.448
Are you okay?

30:21.361 --> 30:22.738
It's all true.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.917
It's all right.
You just sleep.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.511
But my angels, miss!

30:38.587 --> 30:40.555
They came, didn't they?
They need me.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.179
They do need you, Gwyneth.
You're their only chance of survival.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.976
I've told you, leave her alone.

30:45.052 --> 30:48.181
She's exhausted
and she's not fighting your battles.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.772
Now, drink this.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.025
But what did you say, Doctor?
Explain it again.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.608
- What are they?
- Aliens.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.155
Like, foreigners, you mean?

31:01.234 --> 31:03.157
Pretty foreign, yeah.
From up there.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.575
- Brecon?
- Close.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.827
And they've been trying to get
through from Brecon to Cardiff,

31:06.948 --> 31:08.040
but the road's blocked.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.744
Only a few can get through
and even then they're weak.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.338
They can only test drive
the bodies for so long.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.628
Then they have to revert to
gas and hide in the pipes.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.710
Which is why
they need the girl?

31:17.793 --> 31:20.467
- They're not having her.
- But she can help.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.599
Living on the rift,
she's become part of it.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.599
She can open it up,
make a bridge and let them through.

31:24.758 --> 31:27.637
Incredible.
Ghosts that are not ghosts

31:27.761 --> 31:29.809
but beings from another world,

31:29.888 --> 31:34.485
who can only exist
in our realm by inhabiting cadavers.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.353
Good system. It might work.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.653
You can't let them run around
inside of dead people!

31:40.732 --> 31:42.359
Why not? It's like recycling.

31:42.651 --> 31:45.154
- Seriously though, you can't.
- Seriously though, I can.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.285
But it's just wrong!

31:47.531 --> 31:48.999
Those bodies were
living people.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.118
We should respect them,
even in death.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.703
Do you carry a donor card?

31:54.162 --> 31:55.709
- It's different, that's...
- It is different, yeah.

31:55.789 --> 31:58.258
It's a different morality.
Get used to it. Or go home.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.754
You heard what they said,
time's short.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.431
I can't worry about
a few corpses

32:04.506 --> 32:06.224
when the last of the Gelth
could be dying.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.846
I don't care,
they're not using her.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.766
Don't I get a say, miss?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.523
Well, yes... Look...

32:12.973 --> 32:14.771
You don't understand
what's going on.

32:14.850 --> 32:18.821
You would say that, miss,
because that's very clear inside your head,

32:18.895 --> 32:19.942
that you think I'm stupid.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.532
- That's not fair.
- It's true though.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.406
Things might be
very different where you're from,

32:25.527 --> 32:27.120
but here and now,

32:27.195 --> 32:29.914
I know my own mind,

32:29.990 --> 32:31.367
and the angels need me.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.291
Doctor?
What do I have to do?

32:35.370 --> 32:37.122
You don't have to do anything.

32:37.205 --> 32:40.049
They've been singing to me
since I was a child.

32:40.125 --> 32:44.221
Sent by my mam
on a holy mission, so tell me.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.261
We need to find the rift.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.595
This house is on a weak spot, so there must
be a spot that's weaker than any other.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.602
Mr Sneed, what's the weakest
part of this house?

32:55.056 --> 32:57.016
The place where
most of the ghosts have been seen?

32:58.018 --> 33:00.612
That would be the morgue.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.649
No chance you were going
to say gazebo, is there?

33:16.870 --> 33:20.090
Huh!
Talk about Bleak House.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.294
The thing is, Doctor,
the Gelth don't succeed,

33:23.418 --> 33:24.418
'cause I know they don't.

33:24.461 --> 33:28.136
I know for a fact that
corpses weren't walking around in 1869.

33:28.215 --> 33:30.138
Time's in ﬂux,
changing every second.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.811
Your cosy little world
can be rewritten like that.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.355
Nothing is safe.
Remember that. Nothing.

33:35.430 --> 33:39.025
Doctor, I think
the room is getting colder.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.442
Here they come.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.442
You've come to help!

33:47.567 --> 33:49.820
Praise the Doctor!
Praise him.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.533
Promise you won't hurt her.

33:51.613 --> 33:55.368
Hurry! Please!
50 little time. Pity the Gelth!

33:56.409 --> 33:58.878
I'll take you somewhere else
after the transfer.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.877
Somewhere you can build
proper bodies.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.504
This isn't a permanent
solution, all right?

34:03.625 --> 34:06.048
My angels!
I can help them live.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.672
Okay, where's the weak point?

34:08.755 --> 34:10.849
Here, beneath the arch!

34:11.216 --> 34:13.139
Beneath the arch.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.303
You don't have to do this.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.226
My angels.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.228
Establish the bridge.
Reach out to the void. Let us through!

34:20.308 --> 34:21.480
Yes!

34:21.976 --> 34:23.478
I can see you.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.482
I can see you! Come!

34:26.940 --> 34:29.659
- Bridgehead establishing.
- Come to me.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.413
Come to this world.
Poor lost souls.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.829
It has begun!
The bridge is made.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.042
She has given herself
to the Gelth!

34:41.663 --> 34:43.585
Rather a lot of them, eh?

34:43.665 --> 34:46.885
The bridge is open.
We descend.

34:51.797 --> 34:54.141
The Gelth will
come through in force.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.103
You said that
you were few in number!

34:57.178 --> 35:00.773
A few bill/on!
And all of us in need of corpses!

35:04.686 --> 35:08.065
Now, Gwyneth, stop this.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.575
Listen to your master!

35:10.650 --> 35:14.325
This has gone far enough.
Stop dabbling, child,

35:14.404 --> 35:17.453
and leave these things
alone, I beg of you.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.875
Mr Sneed, get back!

35:35.759 --> 35:37.432
I think it's going
a little bit wrong.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.851
I have joined the legions
of the Gelth.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.318
Come, march with us.

35:45.727 --> 35:46.944
Oh, Glory!

35:48.897 --> 35:53.073
We need bodies.
All of you, dead.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.904
The human race, dead.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.910
Gwyneth, stop them!
Send them back, now!

35:57.989 --> 35:59.741
Three more bodies!
Convert them!

35:59.824 --> 36:01.622
Make them vessels
for the Gelth!

36:01.743 --> 36:05.043
Doctor, I can't! I'm sorry.

36:05.121 --> 36:08.967
This new world of yours,
it's too much for me.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.175
I'm so...

36:13.588 --> 36:15.716
Give yourself to glory.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.972
Sacrifice your lives
to the Gelth.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.849
I trusted you.
I pitied you!

36:19.928 --> 36:24.183
We don't want your pity!
We want this world and all its ﬂesh.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.812
Not while I'm alive.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.735
Then live no more.

36:49.416 --> 36:52.169
But I can't die.
Tell me I can't.

36:53.253 --> 36:57.099
I haven't even been born yet,
it's impossible for me to die.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.717
Isn't it?

36:59.676 --> 37:01.053
I'm sorry.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.775
Failing! Atmosphere hostile!

37:12.188 --> 37:13.314
Gas!

37:14.566 --> 37:15.692
The gas!

37:16.776 --> 37:20.246
But it's 1869,
how can I die now?

37:20.321 --> 37:23.746
Time isn't a straight line,
it can twist into any shape.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.794
You can be born
in the 20th century and die in the 19th.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.338
And it's all my fault.

37:28.788 --> 37:30.165
I brought you here.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.752
It's not your fault.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.512
- I wanted to come.
- What about me?

37:36.796 --> 37:39.265
I saw the fall of Troy.
World War Five.

37:39.549 --> 37:41.802
I pushed boxes
at the Boston Tea Party.

37:41.885 --> 37:44.013
Now I'm gonna die in a dungeon,

37:44.637 --> 37:46.014
in Cardiff!

37:47.640 --> 37:49.313
And it's not just dying.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.819
We're gonna become one of them.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.540
We'll go down fighting, yeah?

38:08.620 --> 38:11.248
- Yea h. Yea h.
- Together?

38:14.250 --> 38:15.627
I'm so glad I met you.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.463
Me, too.

38:20.256 --> 38:24.136
Doctor! Doctor!
Turn off the flame, turn up the gas.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.267
Now fill the room!
All of it, now!

38:26.346 --> 38:28.895
- What are you doing?
- Turn it all on!

38:29.224 --> 38:30.817
Flood the place!

38:31.226 --> 38:32.648
Brilliant, gas!

38:32.769 --> 38:34.646
What, so we choke
to death instead?

38:35.063 --> 38:36.861
Am I correct, Doctor?

38:37.023 --> 38:39.071
These creatures are gaseous.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.411
Fill the room with gas,
it'll draw them out of the host.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.205
Suck them into the air
like poison from a wound!

38:45.907 --> 38:48.410
I hope...
Oh, Lord!

38:49.911 --> 38:53.040
I hope that this theory
will be validated soon.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.499
If not immediately.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.335
Plenty more.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.772
It's working!

39:10.932 --> 39:13.151
Gwyneth, send them back.
They lied, they're not angels!

39:15.436 --> 39:16.483
- Liars?

39:16.938 --> 39:18.064
- Look at me.

39:18.606 --> 39:22.281
If your mother and father could look down
and see this, they'd tell you the same.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.866
They'd give you the strength.
Now send them back!

39:24.946 --> 39:27.324
- Can't breathe.
- Charles, get her out.

39:28.658 --> 39:30.911
I'm not leaving her.
They're too strong.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.371
Remember that world you saw?

39:32.453 --> 39:34.080
Rose's world?
All those people.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.379
None of it will exist unless
you send them back through the rift!

39:37.458 --> 39:39.711
I can't send them back.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.464
But I can hold them.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.346
Hold them in this place.
Hold them here.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.599
Get out.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.232
- You can't!
- Leave this place.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.399
Rose, get out, go now.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.818
I won't leave her while
she's still in danger. Now go!

39:57.103 --> 39:58.776
Come on.
Leave that to me.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.745
This way!

40:12.493 --> 40:13.710
I'm sorry.

40:17.790 --> 40:18.962
Thank you.

40:53.034 --> 40:54.126
She didn't make it.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.459
I'm sorry.
She closed the rift.

40:59.248 --> 41:02.718
At such a cost.
The poor child.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.673
I did try, Rose,
but Gwyneth was already dead.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.507
She had been for at least
five minutes.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.221
What do you mean?

41:11.177 --> 41:13.726
I think she was dead
from the minute she stood in that arch.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.146
But she can't have,
she spoke to us,

41:17.225 --> 41:19.478
she helped us, she saved us.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.278
How could she have done that?

41:21.771 --> 41:24.820
There are more things
in Heaven and Earth

41:24.899 --> 41:27.573
than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.531
Even for you, Doctor.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.161
She saved the world.

41:37.704 --> 41:40.457
A servant girl.
No one will ever know.

41:55.555 --> 41:59.276
Right then, Charlie boy,
I've just got to go into my, um, shed.

42:00.643 --> 42:01.895
Won't be long.

42:02.270 --> 42:03.943
What are you going to do now?

42:04.022 --> 42:07.822
I shall take the mail-coach
back to London, quite literally post-haste.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.453
This is no time for me
to be on my own.

42:10.737 --> 42:14.662
I shall spend Christmas
with my family and make amends to them.

42:15.491 --> 42:19.337
After all I've learnt tonight,
there can be nothing more vital.

42:19.454 --> 42:22.082
- You've cheered up.
- Exceedingly!

42:22.165 --> 42:25.169
This morning,
I thought I knew everything in the world.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.295
Now I know I've just started.

42:27.378 --> 42:31.599
All these huge
and wonderful notions, Doctor!

42:31.674 --> 42:34.018
I am inspired,
I must write about them!

42:34.635 --> 42:36.228
Do you think that's wise?

42:36.304 --> 42:37.977
I shall be subtle, at first.

42:38.639 --> 42:42.360
The Mystery Of Edwin Drood
still lacks an ending.

42:42.810 --> 42:46.314
Perhaps the killer
was not the boy's uncle.

42:47.106 --> 42:50.110
Perhaps he was
not of this earth!

42:51.569 --> 42:55.574
"The Mystery of Edwin Drood
And The Blue Elementals!"

42:55.656 --> 42:57.909
I can spread the word,
tell the truth!

42:58.659 --> 42:59.660
Good luck with it.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.829
Nice to meet you, fantastic.

43:02.371 --> 43:04.715
Bye, then. And thanks.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.085
Oh, my dear!

43:09.337 --> 43:10.338
How modern.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.891
Thank you.
But I don't understand,

43:14.008 --> 43:17.057
in what way is this goodbye?

43:18.012 --> 43:20.481
- Where are you going?
- You'll see. In the shed.

43:21.265 --> 43:24.860
Upon my soul, Doctor,
it's one riddle after another with you.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.902
But after
all these revelations,

43:27.980 --> 43:31.029
there's one mystery
you still haven't explained.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.907
Answer me this...

43:35.029 --> 43:36.030
Who are you?

43:40.034 --> 43:41.752
Just a friend.
Passing through.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.457
But you have
such knowledge of future times.

43:45.540 --> 43:49.044
I don't wish to impose on you
but I must ask you...

43:50.336 --> 43:54.887
My books, Doctor, do they last?

43:55.383 --> 43:56.509
Oh, yes.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.182
For how long?

43:59.887 --> 44:00.934
Forever.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.519
Right.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.570
Shed. Come on, Rose.

44:09.147 --> 44:11.866
What? In the box?
Both of you?

44:12.400 --> 44:14.573
Down, boy.
See ya.

44:18.990 --> 44:22.335
Doesn't that change
history, if he writes about blue ghosts?

44:22.410 --> 44:23.957
In a week's time, it's 1870.

44:24.078 --> 44:25.955
And that's the year
he dies. Sorry.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.124
He'll never get
to tell his story.

44:28.249 --> 44:30.843
Oh, no.
He was so nice.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.545
But in your time,
he was already dead.

44:32.628 --> 44:33.880
We've brought him back to life

44:33.963 --> 44:37.342
and he's more alive now
than he's ever been. Old Charlie Boy.

44:37.425 --> 44:39.598
Let's give him
one last surprise.

45:08.039 --> 45:10.542
- Merry Christmas, sir.
- Merry Christmas to you!

45:11.000 --> 45:14.721
God bless us.
Every one.

45:27.391 --> 45:31.362
Big Ben destroyed as a UFO
crash lands in Central London.

45:38.778 --> 45:40.451
What is it, then?
Are they invading?

45:40.529 --> 45:42.748
Funny way to invade,
putting the world on red alert.

45:42.823 --> 45:45.747
By God, I'll put this country
under marshal law if I have to.

45:48.829 --> 45:52.003
Defence plan delta!
Come on. Move! Move!

45:54.085 --> 45:55.177
Clear!
