00:16.960 --> 00:20.720
Electricity - you can't
see it, you can't smell it,

00:20.720 --> 00:22.320
but you know it's there.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.680
What's that?
A sketch.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.880
- What of?
- A polar bear.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.560
I put poo on a painting
for the world to protest.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.880
Gross.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.040
Makes you feel safe,
secure. Warm.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.560
Until it doesn't.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.000
You sure you don't want a lift?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.440
Er, no, we've ordered a cab.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.440
Don't get paint on the carpet.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.560
I'm not even painting.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.120
Yes, but when you do,
don't.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.720
Cassie has got
enough to deal with.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.880
You short a circuit,
there's no warning,

00:48.880 --> 00:51.440
protection trips and wham.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.640
Why can't I come?

00:52.640 --> 00:54.080
Because it's a girls' night.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.600
- I'm a girl.
- And too young.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.080
We'll have a boys' one here.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.800
I'll go gender fluid
for the night.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.000
- What's that?
- Later.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.400
And when you do get
the lights to come back on...

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
Or not.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.840
..it's always a relief.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.800
- Donna's selling sexy stuff.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.560
Enough!

01:11.560 --> 01:13.200
Cab's here.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.280
- Resistance...

01:14.280 --> 01:16.440
- Get him to wait!
- No worries.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.040
..it generates heat,
which is what a dimmer is for.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.120
Won't be long.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.040
It controls the
resistance for the rheostat. OK,
Nathan.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.160
Righto.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.480
Got your bag?
Keys? Credit card?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.920
I won't be buying.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.360
How about you, Mum?

01:30.360 --> 01:32.000
Never say never.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.520
Oh! Thanks, Dave.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.000
Good to be of some use.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.760
It'd be good
to be of more use.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.000
Quick, let's go before
I change my mind.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.320
I'm not buying
anything I can't try first.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.320
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Bye!

01:44.320 --> 01:45.840
What gives?

01:46.680 --> 01:48.800
- What do you mean?
- You and Mum.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.320
Nothing.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.040
So...
what's with Mum and you?

01:56.840 --> 01:59.240
Shame that life
doesn't come with a rheostat.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.160
Oh, wow.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.360
Oh, my lord. Where are we?

02:32.360 --> 02:33.360
Go, Donna.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.520
- There you are. Both gorgeous.
- Look at you!

02:39.400 --> 02:40.600
How are you doing?

02:40.600 --> 02:42.720
It's nice
to think about something

02:42.720 --> 02:43.960
other than that
for a night.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.080
You can always try again.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.000
Right.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.440
Not quite the Country
Women's Association, is it?

02:51.440 --> 02:52.920
Ah, no,
some would lap it up.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.960
Well, you should hold one
in Buradeena then.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.760
And lots wouldn't.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.000
A drink, I think.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.560
Oh, here's one of the girls
from my tap class.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.080
Stella, you came! Brave girl.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.560
- Smiles guaranteed with Donna.
- Yeah. I miss her.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.520
Awww. You've got Tessa.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.480
Yeah. Donna and I
have got history.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.560
- Oh! And here's my Donna.
- Oh!

03:12.560 --> 03:14.880
Anna, Julie. Julie, Anna.
Ben's mum.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.880
Ah, so you're the famous Anna,
I've heard so much about.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.320
I can't believe it's
taken us this long to meet.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.520
Well, we don't get to the city
as often as I'd like.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.440
- How long this time?
- We leave tomorrow.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.280
Oh.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.720
No, but I'm hoping to be around
a lot more in the future.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.320
- Let's drink to that.
- Yeah.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.600
- On the house.
- Oh! I like you already.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.320
To seeing you more.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.920
I'm working on it.

03:35.920 --> 03:36.960
Cheers.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.400
You watch the news,
right?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.160
It's always other people
and then...

03:43.160 --> 03:45.000
..you're suddenly part of the
headline.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.720
Let's hope they sort it
soon.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.000
Well, let's hope we're not the
next Mascot Towers.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.200
Look how that went.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.680
Let us know when you do know,
we'll help however we can.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.280
Thanks. You already helped
with the deposit.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.800
You know,
I'm not asking for more.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.680
You just never really
expect your only asset to...

04:04.040 --> 04:05.040
Work's not helping.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.520
I... missed a major deadline
because of everything.

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
They're not happy.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.240
They gotta understand.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.880
Mind you, part of me wants
to toss the job anyway.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.520
- No home and no job?
- I'm feeling stuck.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.960
Well...

04:20.960 --> 04:22.760
..fire's worse
than the frying pan.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.240
Don't do anything impulsive.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.600
I don't need advice, Dad.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.560
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, so am I.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.800
That it'd be
a bloody idiotic move.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.920
I'm sorry.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.720
Your mum's got me all sensitive
about rash decisions.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.240
She's had a notion.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.600
Oh.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.040
Serious?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.920
Mm, shouldn't be.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.440
Could be.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.560
You kids up for a movie?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.160
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!

05:01.360 --> 05:03.240
Boys' nights aren't
what they used to be.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.680
Tell me about it.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.160
And over and above in
50 shades of saucy grey

05:12.160 --> 05:13.800
that these might suggest,
ladies,

05:13.800 --> 05:15.360
they also help make a point.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.480
The fluffy cuffs
of domestic expectation...

05:19.800 --> 05:21.360
..the blinder on our worldview,

05:22.440 --> 05:25.920
the restriction of our voice,
all as we're objectified.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.240
Well, that was the old way.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.440
The new?

05:30.440 --> 05:31.560
Tie him up.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.560
Tie him down.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.000
Objectify him.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.200
And let him walk about
in our shoes for a night.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.920
Literally, if his kink
bends to that.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.440
Go, Donna.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.520
And once you've let him loose,

05:45.520 --> 05:47.080
whisper in his ear,

05:47.080 --> 05:49.400
"Now you know
why we want our liberation."

05:51.160 --> 05:53.400
Lusty liberation, ladies.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.440
Have a damned hot time
and make a political statement.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.560
Now, fill up and come buy!

06:02.120 --> 06:04.080
I'm up. Excuse me.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.240
So are you gonna
get some for Dave?

06:07.240 --> 06:11.480
Uh... yeah, I might
stock up for down the track.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.960
Mm. Wait till you get home,
good call.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.080
Yeah.

06:16.560 --> 06:21.080
Listen, Cassie, would you mind
if Ruby stayed on for a bit?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.400
She won't need persuading
and you can say no.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.520
We'd love to have her.
If it helps.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.080
You noticed the tension?

06:28.080 --> 06:30.080
Well, I didn't like to
ask.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.120
We just need to
talk things through.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.600
We're just on different sides
of a major issue.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.720
And we certainly don't need
Rubes weighing in.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.240
Whatever works.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.160
What does Dave think?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.400
Um, I'm sure he'll agree.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.040
I mean, I just decided myself.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.920
Hopefully we'll deal with it and
we'll be back to support you.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.680
Is that what it's about?
Being here more?

06:54.640 --> 06:55.760
A lot more.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.880
When the lights in
a house start to flicker,

07:02.880 --> 07:05.520
you might have a minor matter
or it's something serious.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.040
There's only one way
to find out.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.280
Make sure you pop in on
your grandad, won't you?

07:10.280 --> 07:11.840
I'll try and squeeze him in.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.920
Joke, Mum.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.400
We'll be busy though, right?

07:15.400 --> 07:17.520
Yeah, we'll be painting
the town red.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.840
Ruby, more like.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.600
- Ah-ha-ha!
- Lame, Dad.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.920
I know, I know.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.200
You can stay too.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.200
Oh, we've got some
post-anniversary private time.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.640
Ooh, I see liberation!
You got some, right?

07:29.640 --> 07:31.920
That's enough of that.
I'll see you next weekend.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.040
Love you, Mum.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.640
- See ya.
- See ya, Dad!

07:35.200 --> 07:36.600
Just make sure she behaves.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.800
Mwah.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.440
And you rest up.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.480
Bye.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.520
Your dad mentioned your job.
No snap decisions, please.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.240
Travel safe. Whatever it is,
sort it out, OK?

07:47.120 --> 07:48.480
- Love you.
- Love you.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.680
Love you too, little man.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.720
Don't let Ruby lead you astray.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.200
I'll lead her.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.560
Good onya, kidda!

07:55.560 --> 07:58.080
- Bye!
- Bye!

07:58.080 --> 07:59.840
Bye!

07:59.840 --> 08:01.040
Bye!

08:01.040 --> 08:03.880
That's what we don't
have in Buradeena.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.240
Let's just enjoy the drive.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.200
What, five hours without
talking about it?

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
See how we go.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.880
They're your case,
mine's better made at home.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.760
Fine. Dad?

08:12.760 --> 08:14.200
Yep.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.200
Bye!

08:15.200 --> 08:17.280
- OK, Edward.
- Yeah?

08:17.280 --> 08:18.720
Shall we plan
our schedule?

08:18.720 --> 08:20.080
Art gallery.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.400
Yes, there's art down the road
every weekend.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.480
- Do you wanna go check it out?
- Yeah!

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
- Something is off.
- Yeah.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.520
Mum hinted to Cassie that she
wants to move back.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.200
- What, here?
- Yeah.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.840
They love Buradeena.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.080
Dad does.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.440
So does she.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.880
Doesn't she?

08:44.360 --> 08:47.040
Y-y-y-you can't head off
until you've seen your mum!

08:47.040 --> 08:48.280
She won't be coming, Dad.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.600
Of course she will!

08:50.600 --> 08:54.520
Shame she missed out on
the kung pao chicken, eh? Ha-ha.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.760
No, no, don't dash off.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.240
Oh Dad, I'm sorry, we just...

08:58.240 --> 09:00.120
We need to beat the traffic.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.360
But we'll be back, OK?

09:02.360 --> 09:03.640
And Ruby'll come and visit.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.880
Ruby?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.360
Oh, right, right.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.760
Ruby, Ruby.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.200
I'll see you next weekend.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.120
You drive careful,
young fella.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.120
Sure will, Ted.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.080
See ya tomorrow.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.640
I miss you, Dad.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.960
Why is it suddenly
upsetting you?

09:35.960 --> 09:37.320
It always has.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.640
Not like this.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.320
You've managed for years.
Why now?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.480
He loved that dinner.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.760
He wants to spend more time
with us, away from here.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.880
More you him, I think.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.200
All he remembers
is the kung pao chicken.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.360
How many times
have the doctors told you?

09:50.360 --> 09:52.760
There's no point tying
your life to him.

09:52.760 --> 09:53.760
He's my father, Dave!

09:53.760 --> 09:56.240
He hardly remembers
whether you've been here or not.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.480
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be
cruel, but it's true.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.200
Well, maybe he would
if I was here more!

10:00.200 --> 10:02.480
And maybe I don't want our
children forgetting us.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.360
That's drawing the long bow.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.640
We're...

10:05.640 --> 10:08.320
We're drifting as a family,
Dave.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.360
Want me to drive?

10:20.960 --> 10:24.640
I tried giving advice to Nathan
but he shut me down.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.640
Nice, but firm.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.640
Do you know
I met Cassie's best friend

10:29.640 --> 10:31.520
for the first time last night?

10:31.520 --> 10:34.320
Our daughter-in-law's best
friend who works with our son

10:34.320 --> 10:36.520
and it took years to meet her.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.480
We're on the fringe
of their lives, Dave.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.880
We have our lives.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.160
They have theirs.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.240
It's how families go.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.760
It's how it has gone.
Again, why now?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.440
Well, apart from Dad?

10:47.400 --> 10:49.760
Cassie and Ben
losing another baby.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.360
Being here to support her
when they try again.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.320
Nathan and Edward homeless.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.600
And there's gotta be better
schools for Ruby.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.480
OK for starters?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.160
You don't have to
live in your kids' pockets

11:04.160 --> 11:06.000
to be a good parent.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.120
You are putting a town we have
been in a few years

11:08.120 --> 11:09.160
ahead of family.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.520
You're asking me, "Why now?"

11:10.520 --> 11:11.560
I'm asking you, "Why?"

11:11.560 --> 11:13.360
I have my reasons.
Being?

11:14.480 --> 11:15.920
Back in Buradeena.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.080
Why not now?

11:17.080 --> 11:19.360
It's easier to make
your point here.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.080
It's easier to make mine there.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.280
Electricity all around us.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.640
Silent...

12:35.600 --> 12:37.320
..until sparks fly.

12:45.760 --> 12:49.120
Farewell, Acropolis.
Get Carbonated's home.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.400
Do you know there's that many
Greeks in Australia,

12:51.400 --> 12:53.280
even the kangaroos speak Greek?

12:53.280 --> 12:54.640
True story.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.760
Who knew every
great Aussie surfer is Greek?

12:57.760 --> 12:59.640
That's right, all the world
champions...

12:59.640 --> 13:00.800
Thanks, Griggsy.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.280
..in Australia
are champions

13:03.280 --> 13:04.880
because they all
Get Carbonated...

13:05.880 --> 13:07.560
- You're on fire!
- Yep.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.800
What's it like having
all those followers?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.800
Oh, you know, you
get used to it. It's great.

13:13.800 --> 13:14.840
Thought so.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.680
Right, tell Nathan and
Cassie I'll catch 'em later.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.320
Hey, um, is Benno
working all day?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.840
Far as I know.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.560
Alright well, have fun at
the art... whatever it is.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.200
Alright, catch ya,
Rubes.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.320
Catch ya, Carbo.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.040
Yassou. Good to see
you.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.440
You too!

13:49.800 --> 13:52.480
My efforts are not
inconsiderable,

13:52.480 --> 13:54.320
if I do say so myself.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.200
Um.
Loving it big time!

13:57.200 --> 13:58.760
Come look at this!

13:59.320 --> 14:01.400
Here we go. Come on,
Ed.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
We've got some art.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.680
You have good taste.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.200
All of these are
original Whitemans.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.600
You give good brushstroke.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.280
Your daughter shows
admirable precocity.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.080
Sister.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.000
A late life child.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.240
Often wise beyond their years.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.480
Sent here to teach us lessons.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.440
$1000. $950 for you.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.760
OK.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.840
Every sister needs
a generous brother.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.680
Ah! Well, every brother
needs money to be generous.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.200
And, er, no can do.

14:37.080 --> 14:40.840
Fiscally challenged.
I can relate to that.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.360
- You paint, er...
- Ruby.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.920
Charles. Enchanté.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.280
My last work was the scandal
of the school art show.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.120
More intrigued by the moment.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.240
We'll keep going.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.520
Hey! Eddie! Eddie!

14:56.160 --> 14:58.440
Art's boring!

14:58.440 --> 15:01.760
Mate, you cannot just
go dashing off, alright?

15:01.760 --> 15:02.760
Come on.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.520
You're not trying to set us up.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.720
As if! He's too down to even
notice you.

15:08.720 --> 15:13.320
Totally. That was his fourth
comment about being broke.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.160
Well, his building
is falling apart.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.720
Uh, you're not going on
about your problem.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.040
Well, being broke is easier to
slip into conversation

15:24.040 --> 15:25.360
than having a miscarriage.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.120
And I'm sick of my
problems.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.240
- Outta here!
- Where?

15:29.240 --> 15:31.480
Home. I've got some
serious painting to do.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.400
Move it, Eddie! Come on!

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
Ahh.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.080
Her new best friend
Charles

15:38.080 --> 15:41.640
just casually commented that
he'd "like
to see her work."

15:41.640 --> 15:43.360
Like a bloody seagull
onto a hot chip.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.920
Hey, Rubes, no rush.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.480
We'll all come back
next Saturday.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.200
He's here tomorrow! Come on!

15:48.200 --> 15:50.600
I should charge commission.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.680
Again with the money.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.040
Sympathy.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.920
Home, sweet home.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.600
Not subtle, Dave.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.920
Hold that smile...
as dry as it is.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.400
I'll try.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.640
Look, I don't wanna fight.

16:17.640 --> 16:18.640
Me neither.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.840
Which is why I'm glad we're home
so I can show, not tell

16:21.840 --> 16:24.480
why I wanna stay,
just go with me on it.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.920
No guarantees.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.160
I just want the hearing.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.720
Perfect timing.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.360
I just now fixed
your lamp switch.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.240
Oh, Dave's only been meaning to
do that since, what, Christmas?

16:34.240 --> 16:36.240
Well, you know, you can't rush
these things.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.800
Well, thank you,
I appreciate it.

16:37.800 --> 16:38.600
Where's Rubes?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.200
She's given her
a week off the leash.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.200
Watch out, Sydney.
Cyclone Rubes.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.080
Hey, I'm taking the bike out
if you want...

16:44.080 --> 16:45.760
- Later, maybe.
- Alright, well...

16:45.760 --> 16:48.160
the worksheets are on your desk
and it's all covered.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.080
Thanks for holding the fort.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.560
Along with my exam results.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.880
Hey! Hey, not so fast.
How'd you go?

16:53.880 --> 16:55.440
I reckon the boss will be
stoked.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.240
Good on him.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.080
In three and a bit years,
he'll qualify.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.320
I'm not gonna let him down.

17:04.320 --> 17:07.440
Well... couldn't he transfer his
apprenticeship to...

17:07.440 --> 17:09.320
I don't know,
Stan Bridgeman?

17:09.320 --> 17:12.400
Stan Brightman
doesn't take on apprentices.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.760
OK, well, someone else, then.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.080
I'm it for a 100km radius.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.800
Well, he could come
with us, then.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.920
He ran from the city.
He doesn't wanna go back!

17:19.920 --> 17:22.760
When I was his age, if my
father hadn't helped,

17:22.760 --> 17:24.960
I don't know
where I would've ended up.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.800
It's called passing it on.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.920
Your own children
have worries, Dave.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.720
They're in their
thirties, Jules.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.680
Let's dump these
and go and do coffee.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.400
Oh, hey-hey!

17:48.400 --> 17:50.320
Surprise a girl,
why don't you?!

17:50.320 --> 17:53.160
You know you can trust the joint
when they eat here themselves.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.720
- Welcome back, Julie.
- Thank you.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.800
Not everyone disagrees
with Ruby.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.080
Perfect timing!

17:58.080 --> 17:59.960
They're not all hicks.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.080
Couldn't wait to say hello?

18:03.080 --> 18:04.880
Just the usual, thanks, Tessa!

18:04.880 --> 18:06.480
Grab a pew.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.320
Your apron's ready
whenever you are.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.560
Thanks.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.800
If the point is
"she'll miss me," I'll miss her!

18:22.800 --> 18:24.280
That was a point.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.560
The main one's this.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.560
Check the prices.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.200
There is no way we
could sell our place here

18:32.200 --> 18:34.720
and buy more than
a dump in Sydney.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.560
Especially if we have
to help out Nathan.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.640
We'd find something.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.640
Not without having
a mortgage over our head.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.280
You want to go into debt again?

18:43.280 --> 18:45.320
- At our age?
- Couldn't we at least look?

18:45.320 --> 18:47.640
I mean, we could
dip into our savings.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.080
There goes the safety net.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.800
I'm gonna
start googling prices.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.520
Good luck.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.560
I can hear Ruby,
"I'm not living in this dump!"

18:57.560 --> 18:59.000
And the schools are no better

18:59.000 --> 19:01.040
in the few areas
we might afford.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.640
- You're assuming.
- You're wishful thinking.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.400
- If we look hard enough...
- Feel free.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.560
Stick your head in the sand.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.040
Fine.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.320
Alrighty.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.280
Here you go, Picasso.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.680
Thank you.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.080
Many dogs around here?

19:30.880 --> 19:32.920
You are not taking
dog poo tomorrow.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.680
I can't show it
to Charles without it.

19:34.680 --> 19:35.920
In a container. Get some.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.520
- Nuh-uh-uh! Stay.
- Awww...

19:39.520 --> 19:42.520
Every great artist is
misunderstood.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.520
I'll do it later.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.800
I'm making it
even more controversial.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.880
See you at home?

19:51.960 --> 19:54.040
Around00.
I'll bring the voddie.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.640
Mm! Excellent.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.960
I'm gonna walk.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.480
A bit tense?

20:01.520 --> 20:02.640
She'll explain.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.920
Look, I need a favour.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.400
Just between us.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.000
And now one of our
more exotic habitats,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.720
filled with
some of your

20:17.720 --> 20:19.280
favourite wildlife.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.440
Benno!

20:22.440 --> 20:24.720
Smile! You're
getting Carbonated.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.400
Does everything
have to be streamed?

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
"Carbo returns."

20:27.400 --> 20:28.800
"Welcome home, Carbo."

20:28.800 --> 20:30.240
Welcome home, Carbo.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.160
Fans like the big moments.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.680
We all know my mate Benno.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.560
And the Boat Club.

20:35.560 --> 20:36.760
Benno the shy type.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.560
Mate, I'm
glad you're back.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.080
But I'm not a
soap star.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.080
'Days of our Carbos'.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.440
Almost as good as
'Get Carbonated'.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.440
But not as good, eh?

20:45.440 --> 20:46.480
Carbo!

20:46.480 --> 20:47.960
How many times have I told you

20:47.960 --> 20:51.560
this is a business, not a movie
studio? No streaming.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.920
"Welcome back, Carbo."

20:52.920 --> 20:55.480
- Yes, well, that too.
- "How was Greece, Carbo?"

20:56.280 --> 20:57.720
How was Greece?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.640
You'd know if you watched
Get Carbonated!

20:59.640 --> 21:01.280
Not a fan, our Donna.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.440
I'm no-one's Donna.
And this Donna says, "Out."

21:03.440 --> 21:05.960
There are privacy issues.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.080
I'll bring you a welcome-home
beer on the terrace - now, out!

21:09.080 --> 21:11.280
Scoot! Go on!

21:11.280 --> 21:13.080
- Quick sticks!
- Quick sticks!

21:13.080 --> 21:15.240
Love it.
She never disappoints.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.240
Come on, Benno.

21:17.960 --> 21:18.960
Sorry.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.960
He just does it to annoy me.
You just do it to annoy me!

21:21.960 --> 21:25.080
Aw, more memes than you can
shake a selfie stick at.

21:26.560 --> 21:27.680
Memes.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.960
And GIFs.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.080
Memes?

21:34.080 --> 21:35.680
You should
give Donna a break.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.920
The fans love her.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.800
Come on, "quick sticks" -
remember that? It was huge!

21:39.800 --> 21:42.440
I'm an influencer, Benno.
Over a million subscribers.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.960
And I said it would never fly.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.920
- Ye of little faith.
- Where's Retta?

21:45.920 --> 21:48.000
Chained to the stove
like any good wife.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.800
You better not let
her hear you say that.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.800
Ah. she'd be the first
one to laugh.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.080
Too many people taking life too
seriously, Benno.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.400
Why I've got so many
followers - I give them a laugh.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.920
- You reckon?
- You think I'd do it if I
didn't?

21:58.920 --> 22:00.440
How's Theo?

22:00.440 --> 22:02.680
More like his dad every day.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.120
Poor kid.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.480
How about you? You're right?

22:11.480 --> 22:14.280
We really thought
we'd be fine this time.

22:16.640 --> 22:20.280
We'll give it another go
when we get the bucks.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.720
It's gotta be tough on Cassie.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.400
She's no quitter.

23:00.440 --> 23:04.200
Shaken, not stirred.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.760
With a slice of lemon,
Mrs. Bond.

23:05.760 --> 23:06.920
Oh, thank you.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.360
Chin-chin.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.520
And chin up.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.560
Ah, it's been a while coming.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.240
He loves you.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.120
I know.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.280
Just doesn't stop him assuming
that this will pass.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.160
It won't?

23:29.160 --> 23:31.040
No.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.560
I've never even
heard you two argue.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.080
Well, hopefully you won't.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.520
I didn't want
the kids to either,

23:36.520 --> 23:37.920
which is why we've just been

23:37.920 --> 23:38.960
sitting on it.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.720
Oh. See how you go.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.160
He might surprise you.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.560
How do you mean?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.720
I'm sure he might have a few
original thoughts

23:48.720 --> 23:50.920
on how to push his agenda.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.240
- Mmm.
- You never know.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.480
Really?

23:58.280 --> 23:59.480
Oh, this is so good.

24:00.680 --> 24:01.920
Just one for you.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.640
I want your
head clear for the night.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.240
Where's your wheels?

24:18.240 --> 24:20.200
I brought these instead.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.560
Perfect end to the perfect ride.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.000
Just one, though.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Works for me.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.920
You didn't see it coming?

24:28.920 --> 24:30.880
Lying in bed,
she just came out with it.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.880
You must've been like...

24:32.880 --> 24:33.960
I still am like...

24:36.280 --> 24:38.720
Look, I'll go crash with a mate
for a few days.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.440
Get out your hair
while you sort it out.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.960
You're out the back, it's fine.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.160
It's easier to row
if you're alone.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.440
I hope we don't.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.120
It's got its upside.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.480
Make-up sex.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.480
Oi!

24:49.480 --> 24:50.920
It's the best sort!

24:50.920 --> 24:54.120
- Says the voice of experience.
- Hey, I started early.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.120
Serious. I'll go stay
with a friend.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.000
You know, grab a few things
and scoot.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.560
Back at work on Monday.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.280
Thanks, mate.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.800
What if she digs her heels in?

25:10.680 --> 25:12.040
Better make sure she doesn't.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.440
What if she does?

25:17.560 --> 25:18.680
Dunno.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.400
I did a painting of the
world for the one at school.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.720
But this one's better.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.920
Animals get people sentimental.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.200
Imagine it with poo on top!

25:34.200 --> 25:35.920
Where's Julie?

25:35.920 --> 25:37.760
They've gone home for a bit.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.480
They came and saw you, remember?

25:39.480 --> 25:41.480
But she looks like Ruby.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.040
I am Ruby, Grandad.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.680
But Ruby comes with them!

25:44.680 --> 25:46.080
Normally, yeah.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.240
They've let me
run free for a bit.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.240
I'm taking this
to show Charles tomorrow.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.880
Charles Whiteman, not Blackman.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.960
He's the famous one.
He's dead anyway.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.360
You talk too much.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.680
Where's Julie?

25:58.680 --> 26:01.080
Ruby comes with Julie,
so who's she?

26:01.080 --> 26:02.800
It is Ruby, Grandad.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.560
But I tell you what,
we'll go

26:05.560 --> 26:07.960
and we'll tell Mum that you
were looking for her, OK?

26:07.960 --> 26:09.600
Poo? I mean, what sort of thing

26:09.600 --> 26:11.600
is that for a little girl
to be talking about?

26:11.600 --> 26:13.680
I'm sorry, Grandad,
I just wanted to show you.

26:13.680 --> 26:14.760
Just leave it.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.000
Your mother should wash
your mouth out with soap!

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Miss Potty Mouth!

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Hey, it's fine, Grandad.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.520
It's fine.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.960
I wish I'd known him
when he was normal.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.520
You did!

26:29.520 --> 26:31.280
You were just too young
to remember.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.880
You should've seen him with you
when you were a baby.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.480
All I've ever seen
is a sad old man.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.600
I have to believe you
about the rest.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.960
Ah, he was
the best grandad.

26:44.960 --> 26:45.960
I bet.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.480
I really thought my painting
would cheer him up.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.160
I know.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.400
Mum cries a lot
after she's seen him.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.080
She tries to hide it.

27:04.680 --> 27:05.840
Yeah.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.080
You're growing up, kiddo.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.000
Trying to.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.200
Tessa!

27:39.360 --> 27:41.280
Paddo! Good on you.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.280
- I reckon that's it.
- Did he rope you in too?

27:44.280 --> 27:46.760
He told me, I thought
you might need a hand.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.800
You're a good man.
Put it down there.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.200
What do you reckon?

27:53.200 --> 27:55.040
Well...

27:55.040 --> 27:57.960
...I'm usually better at
seeing these things coming.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.680
I'd miss 'em.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.840
Big time.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.160
Here's to a little bit
of romance. Hope it helps.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.320
Yeah, I hope so.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.920
Oh, Dave, I'm not
in the mood to socialise.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.400
Who says we're socialising?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.200
Well, eating out is socialising.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.520
Not always. Come on!

28:16.520 --> 28:17.880
OK.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.600
Smell that. Serenity.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.400
Oh, stop!

28:32.680 --> 28:34.520
Couldn't have asked
for better weather.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.480
Right. That's our cue
to get out of here.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.280
I reckon I've seen this
in a movie somewhere.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.280
No such thing as an original
idea in a rom-com.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.280
My granny flat's free
if they do leave.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.240
I won't need it.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.600
Mrs. R will settle.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.560
No worries.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.880
What?

29:27.640 --> 29:28.680
You'll see.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.120
It's easy to lose sight of
romance, Mrs. Rafter.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Welcome to romance.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.560
You don't get that in Sydney.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.160
It's beautiful.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.640
This is beautiful.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.680
The subject is now
banned for the night.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.600
I love you.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.520
I love you.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.520
Shall we?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.960
Yes.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.600
Ah yeah,
that's what happens.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.400
We haven't lost it.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.080
No, we haven't!

31:49.440 --> 31:51.080
Well, we won't lose it.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.240
No.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.480
It's easy to feel good
in an afterglow.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.080
Not so much in the
twilight.

32:09.720 --> 32:13.320
And it takes some effort
when you're in the shadows.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.880
It's fun with the kids here.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.920
Hm. Never a dull moment.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.960
It won't be with ours, either.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.240
'Night.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.840
'Night.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.080
And when you
start to wonder

33:11.080 --> 33:13.920
what the cold light of
day is gonna bring.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.600
Putting in quite
a sprint there, Rubes!

33:24.600 --> 33:25.680
Carbo's waiting!

33:26.240 --> 33:28.040
Wish we could bottle
her enthusiasm.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.360
Hm.
We'd make a fortune.

33:29.360 --> 33:30.880
I'd be first in line.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.720
I know, sorry. Downer.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.760
There he is! Carbo!

33:35.760 --> 33:36.880
G'day, Rubes!

33:36.880 --> 33:37.880
Hi!

33:37.880 --> 33:39.920
I just told Charlie I'd
get his name out there.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.120
- Charles.
- I better get that right, then.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.760
Retta, welcome home!

33:43.760 --> 33:45.600
Oh, it's good to see you!

33:45.600 --> 33:47.240
- Hi.
- Hello.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.520
I can't wait to
hear about Greece.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.720
Oh, I can't wait to tell.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.200
How are you, little Theo?

33:53.200 --> 33:55.440
- Carbonated!
- Ho ho, I bet you are.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.640
He's growing!

33:56.640 --> 33:58.760
Yeah, he's getting more
like his dad every day.

33:58.760 --> 33:59.760
Yeah.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.600
Carbo streams all
over the world.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.480
Gonna make you famous, Charles.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.160
From your mouth to God's ear.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.200
Oh, I like that.
OK, you all set?

34:07.200 --> 34:09.240
- Yep.
- Alright. I'll do
the intro.

34:09.240 --> 34:13.320
- Retta, my assistant director.
- And number one fan.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.680
Only fan I kiss.

34:14.680 --> 34:15.960
I'd better be.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.960
OK, and...

34:19.960 --> 34:21.920
In...

34:22.680 --> 34:24.160
..three, two...

34:25.680 --> 34:26.920
Action.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.160
OK, we are here
today streaming live,

34:29.160 --> 34:30.160
Get Carbonated

34:30.160 --> 34:31.480
with Sydney's very own

34:31.480 --> 34:33.200
little eco-disaster
artist,

34:33.200 --> 34:34.960
Ruby Rafter.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.920
Now, she was censored at school
and she's here today

34:37.920 --> 34:40.280
to show her work
to the world-renowned artist,

34:40.280 --> 34:41.640
Charles Whiteman.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.120
On the painting, agapi mou.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.640
It's called "Gritty Old Men"

34:47.640 --> 34:49.640
or "White Bears."

34:49.640 --> 34:50.880
Take it away, Rubes.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.160
They're starving on melting ice

34:54.160 --> 34:56.440
because politicians are too dumb
to see the truth.

34:56.440 --> 34:59.320
The title changes when I add
this and go 3D.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.000
Close-up, Retta.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.600
Deep in shit.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.840
That will be us
if we don't change.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.680
The art of protest. Brava, Ruby.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.440
It's why
I was censored at school!

35:15.440 --> 35:18.280
You heard her, censored.
Make a trend.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.840
Change starts with us.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.560
Yeah, it does.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.480
Yes, start with ourselves.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.960
I'll resign tomorrow.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.120
Oh, you beat us to it.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.680
Thanks, Tessa. So kind of you.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.200
Should've done it last night.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.160
Now, that
would've been romantic.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.640
Food stayed warm?

35:49.640 --> 35:51.640
- Yep.
- You got hot.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.960
Uh, yeah.

35:56.640 --> 35:58.640
But...

36:03.560 --> 36:05.000
Morning, Dave.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.960
Hey, Deb.
What can I do for you?

36:09.960 --> 36:11.800
Is Paddo up yet? Do you know?

36:11.800 --> 36:14.160
Uh, he's not here, actually.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.600
Said he was staying at a mate's.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.640
No, we dropped him
back here last night.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.640
Oh, right. I didn't realise it.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.840
Yeah, it was a party.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.360
He wasn't really in the mood.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.480
You guys leaving?

36:28.640 --> 36:30.360
My cousin and I
are going fishing.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.160
I thought it might cheer him up.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.920
Could you give me a sec
to talk to him first?

36:34.920 --> 36:36.480
Yeah, of course.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.640
It's none of
my business, really.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.000
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.960
Well, you're part of our
business, so it is.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.320
And you're a good mate.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.200
If you have to go, mate,
you have to.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.200
I'll get dressed
and make myself scarce.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.160
We haven't made a decision,
just so you know.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.880
My mum always says

36:55.880 --> 36:59.680
that you should go find
somewhere quiet to sit

36:59.680 --> 37:01.080
and listen to your instincts.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.800
Wise woman.

37:07.800 --> 37:08.920
She is.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.000
Ah, Dave had his mid-life crisis
about six years ago,

37:20.000 --> 37:21.600
I don't know,
maybe this is mine.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.320
Mid-life and crisis I get.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.640
What was yours?

37:26.640 --> 37:28.600
You don't need to know.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.680
No, please. It might help me
get perspective.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.280
I was standing in the kitchen,

37:37.640 --> 37:40.040
surrounded by broken glass.

37:41.800 --> 37:46.200
I'd thrown the best crystal
to...

37:46.200 --> 37:48.280
..stop my husband.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.640
He was wearing socks

37:50.640 --> 37:52.960
so he couldn't get at me
without ripping his feet.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.160
He went to get his
shoes

37:55.160 --> 37:56.360
so he could come back

37:56.360 --> 37:58.400
and beat the hell out of me

37:58.400 --> 38:00.480
and I suddenly
thought to myself,

38:00.480 --> 38:02.680
"I'm not gonna take it anymore."

38:04.160 --> 38:07.400
So I literally walked over
broken glass to leave.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.520
I never knew.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.400
I never told you.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.360
Makes "I'm unfulfilled in
Buradeena" pretty lame.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.200
Hey, everybody's got their
crunch point.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.760
- Yeah.
- It's theirs.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.160
It makes it valid, OK?

38:23.640 --> 38:25.320
What now for you?

38:26.640 --> 38:28.520
Uh...

38:28.520 --> 38:30.360
I tell Dave.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.480
That you're set on going?

38:35.400 --> 38:36.920
Yeah.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.000
Try and spare
the glassware, yeah?

38:44.480 --> 38:45.640
I'll do my best.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.200
Can't put it off, can we?

39:24.920 --> 39:26.160
No.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.360
I'm going.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.360
I'm staying.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.960
Right.

39:44.320 --> 39:47.560
The kids need us, Dave.
Our kids.

39:48.480 --> 39:49.640
And I miss them.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.160
Buradeena was wonderful
for a time.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.640
That time's up.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.520
Any practicalities
can be worked through.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.160
Ignoring practicalities is
easier said than done, Jules.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.320
That aside...

40:14.560 --> 40:16.400
..I like being Dave Rafter.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.640
I found him here better than
I've ever known him before.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.040
I was shunted
from pillar to post as a kid.

40:31.520 --> 40:33.520
And then we met
and we became Dave and Julie.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.520
And the kids came along.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.000
And we became the Rafters.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.200
That was great.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.760
For a time.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.960
We went on the road to
reinvent it

40:49.960 --> 40:51.680
and that was fun for a bit too.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.120
And then we lobbed here.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.360
This is where...

41:00.840 --> 41:03.880
..for the first time really,
I've been Dave Rafter.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.920
And I don't see why
I have to give that up

41:08.920 --> 41:11.080
to be a good
father or a husband.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.440
You want to explore, you go.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.400
And I hope you find Julie Rafter
by doing it.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.640
Not just a mother
or a daughter or a wife.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.800
Her... Julie.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.800
To me, going back is...

41:45.160 --> 41:46.640
..going back.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.920
Right.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.160
Say my goodbyes for me?

42:49.480 --> 42:51.280
Yep.

42:53.520 --> 42:55.600
Jesus! How did we get here?

42:56.800 --> 42:58.800
No idea.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.640
But we are.

43:04.920 --> 43:06.480
Yep.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.640
Call?

43:12.760 --> 43:14.080
Every day.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.560
35 years.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.640
Bloody wonderful ones.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.280
Take care.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.600
Yeah, you too.

43:33.840 --> 43:34.880
Give the kids my love.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.560
I'll, um, I'll call ahead
and tell them what's what.

43:37.560 --> 43:39.200
Oh, I won't let them take sides.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.520
Good luck with Rubes.

43:44.800 --> 43:45.920
Right.

43:46.880 --> 43:47.880
Bye.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.960
Life and electricity.

44:36.080 --> 44:39.680
Overload the circuit,
and "bang" go the fuses.

44:40.720 --> 44:43.320
You really are...

44:43.320 --> 44:44.480
..in the dark.
