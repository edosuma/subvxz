WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.832
Now, I understand why there's so
many songs written about love.

00:06.919 --> 00:09.879
It truly is all you need and
what makes the world go round.

00:09.966 --> 00:13.274
Yeah, I know, Carl.
I have a radio, too.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.015
But have you really
listened to those songs?

00:15.102 --> 00:16.277
For me, it's like
my eyes and ears

00:16.364 --> 00:17.843
are open for the first time.

00:17.930 --> 00:21.238
Well, your mouth couldn't
go it alone forever.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.632
Colors look brighter,
air smells fresher

00:23.719 --> 00:25.460
and I find myself
smiling at strangers

00:25.547 --> 00:27.766
for no reason at all.

00:27.853 --> 00:31.509
Have a good day, citizen.
Every single one is precious.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.120
Wow, did you finally
spend the night

00:33.207 --> 00:34.991
with your girlfriend
or did the lady in dispatch

00:35.078 --> 00:37.515
wear the white sweater
with the red bra?

00:37.602 --> 00:39.082
Hey, don't drag it
through the gutter.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.562
Christina's a smart,
beautiful woman

00:40.649 --> 00:41.824
and we have a real connection.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.782
You take your time
with a gal like that.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.349
You got to build up a trust

00:45.436 --> 00:48.874
before you make her ride
the freak train to nasty town.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.833
My apologies,
but usually at this point

00:50.920 --> 00:52.704
in your relationships
you've already broken up

00:52.791 --> 00:55.272
with the woman and made out
with her sister.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.839
It's true that in the past
I've been somewhat

00:56.926 --> 01:00.190
of a rascally opportunist,
but since I've met Christina

01:00.277 --> 01:01.974
I've gone through
an emotional growth spurt.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.976
Ah, I see,
so, you're still full of crap

01:04.064 --> 01:07.545
but now it's a whole
different kind of crap.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.634
A more mature crap.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.941
A worldly crap.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.769
Hey, Samuel, my good man

01:13.856 --> 01:15.727
how's your morning
going so far?

01:15.814 --> 01:17.903
Well, the heat went out at my
apartment at 4 o'clock

01:17.990 --> 01:19.688
this morning and I was awakened
by the sound

01:19.775 --> 01:22.082
of my chattering teeth.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.605
Then when I got to work,
I slipped on a piece

01:23.692 --> 01:26.695
of Canadian bacon
and pulled a hamstring.

01:26.782 --> 01:29.045
What I'm hearing
is he got to see the sun rise

01:29.132 --> 01:31.874
his other leg is fine, and
he's got a strong set of teeth.

01:34.006 --> 01:37.401
You spend all day with him
carrying a loaded gun.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.229
I have a newfound
respect for you.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.973
Hey, what are you and Molly
doing this weekend?

01:44.060 --> 01:45.322
Maybe the four
of us could double, you know?

01:45.409 --> 01:46.889
Nice dinner, catch a movie.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.412
Well, we're not eating out
much now 'cause we're trying

01:48.499 --> 01:49.935
to save money for the wedding.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.023
Maybe you and Christina
could just come over

01:51.111 --> 01:52.068
and have dinner at the house.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.330
Oh, great idea.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.679
That way she can see
you and Molly

01:54.766 --> 01:56.203
blissfully co-habitating
and how comfortable

01:56.290 --> 01:58.596
I am in a domestic setting.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.729
Plus, it saves us
about 80 bucks apiece

02:00.816 --> 02:02.774
and I don't have to leave
the house or put on hard shoes.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.036
- Win-win.
- You know what?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.169
It really is a beautiful day.

02:06.256 --> 02:11.653
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

02:11.740 --> 02:15.352
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:26.972 --> 02:31.499
Victoria, we are not inviting
your pot dealer to my wedding.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.240
Well, it's gonna be awkward
if I don't ask him

02:33.327 --> 02:35.372
'cause I see him
like every other day.

02:37.026 --> 02:40.160
He can come
to the reception though, right?

02:40.247 --> 02:43.772
We definitely want him
at the reception.

02:43.859 --> 02:44.816
Yeah, I mean,
why should it just be

02:44.903 --> 02:47.645
the happiest day of your life?

02:47.732 --> 02:48.994
Come on, you guys.

02:49.081 --> 02:50.300
I can't make any other
wedding plans

02:50.387 --> 02:52.607
until we get this
guest list done.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.217
You know,
this is gonna be the first

02:54.304 --> 02:56.437
real wedding in the family.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.874
Your daddy and I just had
a quickie civil ceremony

02:58.961 --> 03:00.354
on his lunch hour.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.312
I know, mom,
based on the timeline

03:02.399 --> 03:06.490
I'm pretty sure I was there.

03:06.577 --> 03:09.232
How come Molly got to go
and I didn't?

03:12.757 --> 03:14.106
- Evening, ladies.
- Hi, Mike.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.021
Hey, hon,
did you have a good day?

03:16.108 --> 03:18.415
I've been riding around
with a love-struck Carl

03:18.502 --> 03:20.635
who's decided to replace
speeding tickets

03:20.722 --> 03:23.203
with friendly warning hugs.

03:23.290 --> 03:27.076
On the plus side, I think that's
actually a better deterrent.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.165
Aw, I am so happy
Carl found somebody.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.080
Do you know if he's
bringing her to the wedding?

03:31.167 --> 03:32.647
Well, it is six months away.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.650
That's a lot of time
and a lot of Carl.

03:35.737 --> 03:39.219
Hey, listen.
About that guest list.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.916
We really need
to lock down a number

03:41.003 --> 03:43.092
so we can put a deposit
down on a reception hall.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.398
Yeah, I know, sweetie.
I'll get on it.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.834
Oh, by the way,
Carl and his girlfriend

03:45.921 --> 03:47.705
are coming over for dinner
on Saturday night.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.141
No, uh, Saturday night?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.361
I can't do anything,
I have book reports to grade

03:51.448 --> 03:53.450
and laundry, wedding stuff.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.931
Well, just blow off the laundry
and the wedding stuff.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.280
Give yourself a break.

03:57.367 --> 04:01.023
You're starting
to look kind of stressed.

04:01.110 --> 04:04.331
Don't kill him, you love him.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.158
You'd like to kill him,
but you can't.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.856
'Cause you love him.

04:13.514 --> 04:14.732
Look at us.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.168
You and your fiancee are having

04:16.256 --> 04:18.475
me and my girlfriend
over for dinner.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.695
Are we civilized or what?

04:20.782 --> 04:22.871
We've come a long way
from spending our weekends

04:22.958 --> 04:25.700
in strip clubs
eating complimentary taquitos

04:25.787 --> 04:27.397
and watching a girl
pick up dollar bills

04:27.484 --> 04:29.138
with her sweaty butt cheeks.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.271
Yeah, well, not to denigrate
those experiences

04:31.358 --> 04:34.143
'cause those were special times.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.927
In their own way.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.103
Plus, we wouldn't be who we are
if we hadn't gone through them.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.845
Exactly. We wouldn't
appreciate what we have now.

04:40.932 --> 04:43.892
You're marrying a schoolteacher
and I'm dating a doctor.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.590
Not bad for a chubby guy
and a pervert.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.246
Right?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.640
Hey, guess what Christina
and I are doing this evening?

04:52.727 --> 04:54.511
We're going shopping
for a bottle of wine

04:54.598 --> 04:56.121
to bring to your place.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.080
Well, I think Molly's
preparing salmon fillets.

04:58.167 --> 05:01.126
So perhaps a fruity Chablis
is in order.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.868
Mm. Indubitably.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.306
Oh, and by the way, my lady
has a bit of a nut allergy.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.046
- Like peanuts, or--
- No, your fatty nuts.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.397
Uh, cashews, your hazelnuts,
your pistachios.

05:10.484 --> 05:13.225
Very well.
I'll inform the chef.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.360
Ain't this something?

05:17.447 --> 05:19.275
Buying wine, planning menus.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.538
It's a far cry from you nursing
a nine-dollar Dr. Pepper

05:21.625 --> 05:22.887
while some stripper
lifts my wallet

05:22.974 --> 05:25.368
during a so-called
"blindfold dance."

05:25.455 --> 05:27.457
Not that those
weren't good times.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.590
Wouldn't trade 'em
for the world.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.985
Mom, please, can we just get
this guest list done?

05:34.072 --> 05:35.552
Now, what about aunt sis?

05:35.639 --> 05:37.032
Is she on your "invite her,
but don't sit her

05:37.119 --> 05:40.557
next to me" pile
or your "rot in hell" pile?

05:40.644 --> 05:43.473
She's good to go, but that
beer-bellied husband of hers

05:43.560 --> 05:47.347
can keep his dead tooth
and his grabby hands at home.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.174
Really?
I always liked Uncle Ferrell.

05:49.261 --> 05:52.482
That's because you never had
to slow dance with that SOB.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.049
He turns your back
from the crowd

05:54.136 --> 05:55.355
and goes at your butt cheeks

05:55.442 --> 05:57.748
like he's trying
to open an oyster.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.148
Well, okay.
What about their kids?

06:06.235 --> 06:07.323
Dougie and Mary Ellen.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.239
You mean druggie and butch?

06:10.326 --> 06:12.720
He'll be high as a kite
and she'll be in the men's room

06:12.807 --> 06:15.070
trying to straddle a urinal.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.209
How about from your church?

06:24.296 --> 06:26.037
Anybody there you can
stand the sight of?

06:26.124 --> 06:28.431
Why do we have to do
the invitations now?

06:28.518 --> 06:29.954
The wedding ain't for months.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.609
It's not just
for the invitations, it's for

06:32.696 --> 06:34.785
chairs and how many
forks we need..

06:34.872 --> 06:37.919
I don't know,
it's a big deal to Molly.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.617
Boy, when she cracks her whip,
you just pull your panties down

06:40.704 --> 06:44.273
and take it, don't you?

06:44.360 --> 06:47.058
Mom, can we please just
get this over with?

06:47.145 --> 06:49.452
Now, what about the ladies
in your Bible study group?

06:49.539 --> 06:53.500
Ah, those holier-than-thou hags
hate me, I don't know why.

06:55.023 --> 06:58.026
I'm a good Christian.
I turn the other cheek.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.855
Which they can
pucker up and kiss.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.339
Oh.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.993
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.779
Vince and I were just talking,
and we really think

07:11.866 --> 07:14.216
a double wedding
is the way to go.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.957
No kidding.

07:16.044 --> 07:18.046
Since we're gonna be
all dressed up anyway.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.657
The "I do's" become
"we do's." Ala-kazam.

07:20.744 --> 07:23.878
Twice the romance,
half the cost.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.707
Ala-kazam, indeed.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.057
We could probably get
a great package deal

07:29.144 --> 07:30.754
on a honeymoon, too.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.321
You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

07:32.408 --> 07:36.020
I'm guessing it's not,
"Help Molly with the groceries."

07:36.107 --> 07:38.501
- Princess Cruise.
- Bingo.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.808
It's like a floating Las Vegas.

07:40.895 --> 07:43.941
Great shows, wonderful buffets,
and once you're in

07:44.028 --> 07:45.682
international waters,
going topless

07:45.769 --> 07:47.597
is practically mandatory.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.167
Once in a blue moon
you get seasick and yak.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.516
But it's all you can eat,
so you're not really

07:53.603 --> 07:57.389
losing any money.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.956
Well, let me think about it.

07:59.043 --> 08:02.569
Oh! Um...no.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.267
We planted the seed.
Just let it grow.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.838
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.143
Would you help me
put these groceries away?

08:12.230 --> 08:13.449
Sure.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.494
For tomorrow night
I'm gonna make

08:14.581 --> 08:16.321
a nice salmon with a dill sauce

08:16.408 --> 08:18.367
and vegetables
and a rice pilaf.

08:18.454 --> 08:19.847
Hopefully, they will
look like those things

08:19.934 --> 08:22.197
and taste like those things.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.590
Wow, you're something else.

08:23.677 --> 08:26.244
How did a guy like me
ever get a gal like you?

08:26.331 --> 08:28.072
I don't know, but don't
blow your last two wishes

08:28.159 --> 08:31.336
on pizza and beer.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.556
Hey, did you and your mom
finish your guest list?

08:33.643 --> 08:35.427
Well, mom's still
kind of working on hers

08:35.515 --> 08:37.038
and I think I'm just gonna
hang a sign-up sheet

08:37.125 --> 08:38.430
down at the precinct.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.389
Sign-up sheet? Why don't
you just stick flyers

08:40.476 --> 08:43.610
under people's
windshield wipers?

08:43.697 --> 08:46.351
That's kind of impersonal.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.832
At this rate, we're gonna
lose our reception hall

08:48.919 --> 08:51.313
if we don't give them
a head count or a deposit.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.184
Honey, relax, you're starting
to make yourself

08:53.271 --> 08:55.535
and everybody else
a little crazy.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.932
Oh..

09:02.019 --> 09:04.239
So you think I might be
over-thinking it a little?

09:04.326 --> 09:06.197
Well, we do have six months.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.460
You know, I planned my super
bowl party in four hours.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.463
And that included two TVs
and seven kinds of dip.

09:12.987 --> 09:16.468
Wow, seven kinds of dip,
that's..

09:16.556 --> 09:20.603
I didn't realize I was marrying
such an expert party planner.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.911
The key is not to micromanage.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.130
You do what you can,
you delegate the rest.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.611
That's why I put Carl in charge
of three of those dips.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.701
Mm. Oh, yeah.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.747
Well, maybe he can help
you with the catering

09:33.834 --> 09:37.315
and the florist, and..
Oh! And the reception hall.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.883
- What do you mean?
- I think you're right.

09:39.970 --> 09:43.104
Yeah! I'm gonna just
delegate this stuff.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.889
Now, I don't want to be
planning it all by myself

09:45.976 --> 09:47.499
and driving people crazy

09:47.587 --> 09:49.980
so I'm gonna leave it
to an expert.

09:52.722 --> 09:55.246
I-I wouldn't say I'm an expert.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.162
You know, I am, I am feeling
so much more relaxed already.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.773
Will you put those
groceries away for me?

09:59.860 --> 10:02.776
I'm gonna go take a bath.

10:02.863 --> 10:05.169
Wait, I have to plan
a wedding now?

10:05.256 --> 10:06.518
I'll see you in six months.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.651
I'll be the one
in the white dress.

10:08.738 --> 10:12.046
Seven dips.
That's impressive.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.143
Mom, you gotta quit
changing your mind

10:22.230 --> 10:23.710
about the guest list.

10:23.797 --> 10:29.193
Yes, I realize all your friends
are "two-faced turds."

10:29.280 --> 10:33.154
Just give me a number,
'cause you're killing me!

10:33.241 --> 10:35.809
Alright mom, thanks.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.812
Yes, I know, it's gonna be
a beautiful wedding.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.771
Yes, I am a lucky guy. Bye.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.035
Listen, you'd better
get dressed.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.080
Carl and Christina are gonna

10:46.167 --> 10:47.168
be here in a few minutes.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.212
Well, I'm still expecting calls

10:48.299 --> 10:49.561
from a couple of bakeries.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.085
I bumped up the cake tasting.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.521
I actually drew up
a little chart

10:52.608 --> 10:53.653
with elimination brackets
like they do

10:53.740 --> 10:54.828
with the final four.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.220
Red velvet and mocha chip

10:56.307 --> 10:58.832
are the top two seeds.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.703
Hey, remember,
don't overthink it.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.140
You'll just make
everybody crazy.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.974
- This wine is delicious.
- It ought to be. It cost $35.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.803
- Carl.
- What?

11:13.890 --> 11:15.152
You know, sometimes
the flavor is enhanced

11:15.239 --> 11:17.328
if you know it's pricey.
They've done studies.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.200
He's right, I pawned
generic ice cream off

11:19.287 --> 11:22.464
on Mike before,
telling him it was Haagen-Dazs.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.466
Yeah, well, let's be honest,
that man has never met a bowl

11:24.553 --> 11:25.902
of ice cream he didn't like.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.208
You give him something
white and frozen

11:27.295 --> 11:28.644
he'll give it a lick.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.692
I appreciate you making
dinner for us tonight.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.259
I'm sure you're swamped
with work and wedding plans.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.826
It has been
a little crazy, but

11:36.913 --> 11:38.741
Mike's actually
been helping out quite a bit.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.874
Good for you,
when I was planning my wedding

11:40.961 --> 11:42.440
my ex-husband didn't want
to have anything to do

11:42.527 --> 11:43.746
with the decision making.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.487
You know, some men
can't handle it.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.532
See, me, I got
a decisive nature.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.231
You show me two things,
I'm going to pick one.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.196
Hey, you guys.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.546
It's okay, sweetie.
I was just singing your praises.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.592
She was, I think it's great
that you're helping out

12:03.679 --> 12:06.116
with the wedding plans. It's
too much work for one person.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.901
Oh, believe me, I know.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.467
And that's why I say we forget

12:09.554 --> 12:12.732
all the wedding planning
and just elope.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.343
What?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.519
Why blow a ton of money
on a stupid ceremony

12:17.606 --> 12:19.826
when it's driving us both crazy?

12:21.566 --> 12:23.786
So just forget all the work
I've already put in

12:23.873 --> 12:26.180
and get married
at the courthouse?

12:26.267 --> 12:28.660
Exactly. And we don't have
to wait six months.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.705
We can do it tomorrow.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.054
And since I'm a civil employee

12:31.141 --> 12:34.014
they said there's no waiting.

12:34.101 --> 12:38.409
See? No more blowing time or
money on something nobody wants.

12:42.413 --> 12:45.242
Uh, excuse me, I'm, uh..

12:45.329 --> 12:47.897
I'm going to go
check on the salmon.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.904
She must be going
to the lake.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.651
Stay here.
I'll go talk to her.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.309
[door closes]

13:08.396 --> 13:10.311
Man, you don't know
a thing about women.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.664
He's been in charge of our
wedding for exactly 16 hours

13:15.751 --> 13:19.755
and his one big idea is,
"Let's not have a wedding."

13:19.842 --> 13:22.453
Well, it's a sign of how much
you love him that you actually

13:22.540 --> 13:24.586
thought he was gonna be
helpful in the first place.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.544
I never thought I'd be
one of those people

13:26.631 --> 13:30.287
who would care so much
about a wedding, but I do.

13:30.374 --> 13:33.638
Well, I wanted one
since I was a little girl.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.989
Every Saturday,
I'd make my little brother

13:36.076 --> 13:39.035
pretend to marry me
in the backyard.

13:39.122 --> 13:42.125
My dad tells everybody
that's why he's gay now.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.390
Isn't it silly
that I-I want him

13:46.477 --> 13:48.349
to be as excited
about it as I am?

13:48.436 --> 13:52.309
No. A little unrealistic,
but not silly.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.790
My ex-husband and I must have
broken up at least four times

13:54.877 --> 13:56.096
when we were planning
our wedding.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.011
Wow, and you still
went through with it?

13:58.098 --> 14:00.927
Yeah, well, the invitations had
gone out, the band was booked

14:01.014 --> 14:02.232
and my brother
had been rehearsing

14:02.319 --> 14:04.104
"Over the rainbow" for months.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.542
I don't know, maybe he's right.

14:07.629 --> 14:08.978
I mean, maybe we should just

14:09.065 --> 14:11.807
do it quick
and get it over with.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.505
Is that really what you want?

14:14.592 --> 14:17.595
No. I want a real wedding.

14:17.682 --> 14:22.470
The gown and the flowers
and relatives getting drunk

14:22.557 --> 14:25.560
and saying weird things
to each other.

14:25.647 --> 14:28.563
I guess I'm old-fashioned.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.521
Well, then you need
to tell him that.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.175
I have told him.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.874
You've turned off the TV,
looked him in the eye

14:34.961 --> 14:39.704
and said, "I want a traditional,
old-fashioned wedding?"

14:39.791 --> 14:41.750
Not those exact words.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.578
Then, honey, this is on you.

14:43.665 --> 14:47.930
Subtlety and nuance are like
the metric system to men.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.932
You need to tell him
exactly what you want

14:50.019 --> 14:53.501
and then make him
repeat it back to you.

14:53.588 --> 14:54.850
Maybe have him write
it on his hand.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.591
There you go.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.160
I was just trying
to make it easier on her.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.857
All the planning
was driving her crazy.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.120
So take away all the planning.
Seemed logical to me.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.340
Yeah, women don't live
in a logical world.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.386
Man, don't just gulp that down.
That's $1.25 a sip.

15:11.301 --> 15:12.476
You know,
I probably shouldn't have

15:12.563 --> 15:14.043
just sprung it
on her like that.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.437
It was astonishingly
insensitive on your part.

15:16.524 --> 15:19.092
And as your best man, I too
was a little blindsided.

15:19.179 --> 15:22.138
But did I run out of the house
crying? No, I did not.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.923
I kept my pain inside.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.229
I appreciate that.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.883
I mean, that day's important
to me, too.

15:27.970 --> 15:31.843
I already got my speech written
and half memorized.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.151
- Am I tasting hazelnuts?
- I don't know.

15:35.238 --> 15:38.024
- Oh!
- Whoa!

15:38.111 --> 15:40.678
[Carl]
'Oh, my God!'

15:40.765 --> 15:42.463
Carl, I think I need to go
to the emergency room.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.639
- I told you no nuts!
- I've had a lot on my mind!

15:44.726 --> 15:46.597
I've been planning a wedding!

15:46.684 --> 15:49.078
Can we discuss this in the car?
My throat's kind of closing up.

15:49.165 --> 15:53.039
I'll drive, I'll drive.
Oh, God!

15:54.823 --> 15:59.132
We are going to the hospital now
so Christina doesn't die!

16:01.656 --> 16:05.312
No, no, you get the coats,
I'll cork the wine.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.968
Come on!

16:10.099 --> 16:12.493
[instrumental music]

16:14.538 --> 16:15.757
The nurse said
she's going to be fine.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.106
They gave her a shot
of Epinephrine.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.456
- Ah, good.
- Yeah.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.765
Well, Carl's never going
to let me forget this one.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.767
Well, you can understand
him being a little peeved.

16:25.854 --> 16:29.814
I mean, his girlfriend's tongue
blew up like a life raft.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.294
Scary, wasn't it?

16:31.381 --> 16:33.775
It looked like she was
coughing up a ham loaf.

16:37.300 --> 16:40.303
I guess I messed up
everybody's night, huh?

16:40.390 --> 16:43.437
Well, you hurt
my feelings, Mike.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.309
I mean, I thought our wedding
was important to both of us

16:46.396 --> 16:50.009
and it would be fun
for us to plan it together.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.575
But you weren't
having any fun.

16:51.662 --> 16:54.578
It's because I was doing
it all by myself.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.972
The reason I'm marrying you
is 'cause I actually like

16:57.059 --> 17:00.236
doing things with you.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.499
We do have a good time
together, don't we?

17:02.586 --> 17:04.153
Mostly.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.767
I'm sorry.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.726
From now on I'm with you
every step of the way.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.990
We're going to plan
our special day together.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.558
Look me in the eye
and say that again.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.734
[Carl sighs]

17:19.821 --> 17:21.344
Doctor says she doesn't
have to stay overnight

17:21.431 --> 17:23.085
so it'll just be
a few more minutes.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.695
- Good.
- Carl, I'm so sorry.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.220
I feel awful. Ah!

17:27.307 --> 17:28.917
No, it was certainly
negligent on your part

17:29.004 --> 17:31.050
but on the plus side,
I'm scoring some big points

17:31.137 --> 17:32.355
in there just by holding her
hand and telling her

17:32.442 --> 17:34.009
she still looks beautiful to me.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.185
- Sweet.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.840
The woman looked like Apollo
Creed at the end of Rocky II.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.629
Alright, I better
hop back in there.

17:45.716 --> 17:46.935
They're getting ready to shoot
some more steroids

17:47.022 --> 17:48.806
into her supple
little behind and, uh

17:48.893 --> 17:51.244
I don't want to miss that.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.943
See, you could have
done a lot worse.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.511
Well, who'd have thunk it?

17:57.598 --> 17:58.729
[instrumental music]

18:02.646 --> 18:05.606
[sighs]
I'm sorry tonight went
down the way it did

18:05.693 --> 18:07.390
but I'm hoping you'll
give me another chance.

18:07.477 --> 18:10.306
[chuckles]
Of course.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.482
I mean, I'm sure your friends

18:12.569 --> 18:14.702
didn't intentionally
try to kill me.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.748
I'm going to stay on
their good side just in case.

18:17.835 --> 18:20.055
Well, speaking of which,
Mike's really been riding me

18:20.142 --> 18:21.317
about a head count
for the wedding

18:21.404 --> 18:23.841
and I-I don't want
to push you or anything.

18:23.928 --> 18:27.889
Just need to let him know if I'm
going to be a plus one or not.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.544
That's a long way off.
It's not binding.

18:30.631 --> 18:33.068
No contract involved.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.508
I would love to be your date.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.163
That's great.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.860
And listen, I'll hammer home
the whole nut thing

18:42.947 --> 18:44.166
so you can relax and eat
whatever you want

18:44.253 --> 18:45.385
at the reception.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.429
I'll carry a sandwich around

18:46.516 --> 18:47.822
in my pocket, I don't care.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.564
Appreciate it.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.882
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.632
Carl McMillan plus one.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.349
[theme music]
