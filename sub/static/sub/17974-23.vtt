this and not wind up
in bed with him.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.760
And this one.
Plenty of tread
left on this tire.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.328
Aw.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.430
I'm a sucker
for love stories.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.932
So, when
did you know?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.767
Like <i>know</i> know.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.237
I think I've known
since I was ten years old.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.906
<i>I got Dee Dee's solo album.</i>

09:34.908 --> 09:37.242
It was a Japanese import
I bought from my dad

09:37.244 --> 09:38.944
<i>for a sack of weed.</i>

09:38.946 --> 09:41.713
<i>Once I heard that voice,</i>
<i>I didn't miss the weed.</i>

09:41.715 --> 09:43.582
<i>I was high</i>
<i>on her rhythm and blues.</i>

09:43.584 --> 09:46.251
<i>And a little bit of the weed</i>
<i>I kept for myself.</i>

09:46.253 --> 09:48.353
My word.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.921
And we both
collect Pez's.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.022
Well...

09:51.024 --> 09:52.557
What the hell?!

09:52.559 --> 09:55.393
I just finished
my family tree.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.796
Now my dad's gonna
be my grandpa

09:57.798 --> 10:00.732
and my grandma's gonna be
my stepmom or something?

10:00.734 --> 10:03.401
So, do I add more branches?
Connect some branches?

10:03.403 --> 10:05.537
Burn this damn tree down?

10:05.539 --> 10:07.472
There's no app for
this, you know.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.141
I had to
draw this.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.610
Hey, Dad,
hey, Grandma.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.378
I heard you two
were dating.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.780
So, meet my
new boyfriend Walt.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.816
He's <i>five.</i>

10:17.818 --> 10:20.752
Seems wrong, but apparently
that's what we're doing now.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.487
Age ain't nothing
but a number.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.989
Ain't that right, baby?

10:23.991 --> 10:26.057
That is a time-out!

10:26.059 --> 10:27.792
Roberta and Walt?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.494
My word.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.563
I've had enough
of this insanity.

10:31.565 --> 10:34.766
Y'all get out of my house!

10:34.768 --> 10:36.601
Not you, Cleveland!

10:36.603 --> 10:38.503
You're the one
who put them together.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.105
This whole thing
is your fault!

10:40.107 --> 10:42.474
I never want to see any
of them ever again!

10:43.743 --> 10:46.111
Hmm, she's really upset.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.612
I got to fix this.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.581
But how?

10:49.583 --> 10:51.983
Hmm...

10:56.656 --> 10:57.989
That's my arm!

10:57.991 --> 11:00.992
(frogs croaking)

11:00.994 --> 11:02.861
Thanks for taking me
here, Cleveland.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.764
I just needed to get out
and get my mind off of...

11:05.766 --> 11:07.265
Robert boinking your Mom?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.800
Well, that'll be
the last thing

11:08.802 --> 11:10.035
we have to worry about to...

11:11.837 --> 11:15.273
Oh, look who just
happens to be here.

11:15.275 --> 11:18.443
What's the closest thing
y'all got on this menu
to a McGriddle?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.211
You gotta be kidding me!

11:20.213 --> 11:21.680
Let's go.
No.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.281
Let me handle this.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.817
Haven't you two hurt
this woman enough?

11:25.819 --> 11:28.620
As if all the gross--
and I'm sure musky--

11:28.622 --> 11:30.555
sexing you're doing
wasn't enough,

11:30.557 --> 11:32.457
now you have the gall

11:32.459 --> 11:34.559
to come to
her favorite restaurant?!

11:34.561 --> 11:35.794
But you gave us the coupon

11:35.796 --> 11:36.861
and told us to come
here tonight.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.797
Yah!

11:38.799 --> 11:40.298
Can't you see you're breaking
Donna's heart?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.701
Do the right thing
and end this already.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.637
Neither one of you
ever thinks of another person.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.839
You would never be
in one of those commercials

11:47.841 --> 11:50.809
where someone sees
someone do something
nice for someone else,

11:50.811 --> 11:53.378
then they go off and do
something nice for
someone else

11:53.380 --> 11:54.846
and someone sees them.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.514
And then the guy who saw them

11:56.516 --> 11:58.650
ends up doing something
nice for somebody else.

11:58.652 --> 12:00.852
And this keeps going
until you remember

12:00.854 --> 12:03.054
that you were watching
something that was DVR'd,

12:03.056 --> 12:05.156
but you were buzzed
so you forgot to fast forward

12:05.158 --> 12:06.825
through the commercial.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.194
The point is, neither one
of you has ever done

12:09.196 --> 12:12.997
an unselfish or responsible
thing in your life.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.733
I. Am.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.935
The hero of this piece.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.803
I'll have a McGriddle as well.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.407
Bye, Persian man!

12:22.409 --> 12:24.109
I think it's really cool

12:24.111 --> 12:27.078
that you can play basketball
in expensive jeans.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.713
Oh...

12:28.715 --> 12:31.015
Junior?
Where have you been?

12:31.017 --> 12:32.751
I'm off the pole.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.186
My grandfather says
it's vulgar and cheap.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.889
Oh, and also really super gay.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.925
But Junior, we need you
for regionals.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.727
Without you, we're
just a bunch of

12:42.729 --> 12:45.363
saggy, baggy,
middle-aged frump buckets.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.132
No, no, I can't.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.433
You can't?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.034
Or you won't?

12:50.036 --> 12:53.037
You know, Junior,
there comes a time

12:53.039 --> 12:54.639
in every young boy's life

12:54.641 --> 12:57.041
where he has to stand
up to his grandfather

12:57.043 --> 12:58.643
and dance on a pole.

12:58.645 --> 13:03.381
And if you quit,
we all quit.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.818
Is there also shower
for our white BMWs?

13:09.989 --> 13:11.089
(knock at door)

13:11.091 --> 13:12.223
Door's open!

13:12.225 --> 13:13.391
ROBERT:
It's locked.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.659
Window's open!

13:14.661 --> 13:15.760
ROBERT:
Open the damn door!

13:15.762 --> 13:17.929
Hi.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.398
We gave a lot of thought
to what you said, Cleveland,

13:20.400 --> 13:23.268
about how we may not have been
the most responsible people.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.003
We were selfish and horny.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.972
So, together, we decided
to do something positive

13:27.974 --> 13:29.808
to make up for
our past mistakes.

13:29.810 --> 13:30.909
Good.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.577
We adopted a China baby.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.746
Bad.
The hell you did!

13:34.748 --> 13:36.181
Meet Qian Qiang.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.982
Isn't he adorable?

13:37.984 --> 13:41.186
He'd say hi, but he
don't speaka de English.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.154
(gong clangs)
What a turn of events!

13:48.260 --> 13:50.161
How'd you get
a kid so fast?

13:50.163 --> 13:52.430
They make you wait years
for a healthy, white baby,

13:52.432 --> 13:54.432
six months for
an off-white baby,

13:54.434 --> 13:56.301
a whole week for a black baby,

13:56.303 --> 13:58.436
but you gotta lock
your damn door

13:58.438 --> 14:01.039
not to get a five-year-old
Chinese baby.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.842
They're giving them away
like tickets to a WNBA game.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.311
Well, he looks
just like you.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.046
Why would you adopt a child?

14:08.048 --> 14:10.381
Cleveland said we should
stop being so selfish,

14:10.383 --> 14:11.983
and we really took
that to heart.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.986
We're more mature now,
so we got Qian Qiang

14:14.988 --> 14:17.655
because I missed out on my
first chance to be a father.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.858
Not too late.
I'm only five.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.026
Qian Qiang needs
a strong male role model.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.862
Still in my
formative years.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.797
Role model would
do me good.

14:25.799 --> 14:28.800
And I want a chance to
make up for my own
failures as a mother.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.068
Not too late.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.636
Still need mothering.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.405
Because I realized I still
have so much to give.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.740
I'll take it all!

14:35.742 --> 14:37.141
(farts)

14:37.143 --> 14:38.476
(giggles)

14:38.478 --> 14:39.978
Qian Qiang tooted.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.646
Isn't that adorable?

14:41.648 --> 14:43.815
Ha!
Those are always funny.

14:43.817 --> 14:45.817
My man!

14:45.819 --> 14:48.052
So, you're family now?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.854
Well, let me just say...

14:49.856 --> 14:52.023
I'm the cute five-year-old
around here,

14:52.025 --> 14:55.159
and you will not
Olivia Huxtable my world!

14:55.161 --> 14:57.428
Rudy, straight O.G.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.665
Donna, Cleveland,
we came over today

15:00.667 --> 15:02.333
because we wanted to ask you

15:02.335 --> 15:04.502
to be the boy's godparents.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.837
(gasps)
Yes!

15:05.839 --> 15:07.672
Oh, my God, yes!

15:07.674 --> 15:09.007
You have got
to be kidding.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.909
And we'd like you
to stand with us

15:10.911 --> 15:12.777
at a re-naming ceremony,

15:12.779 --> 15:14.712
where we change
Qian Qiang's name

15:14.714 --> 15:16.447
to a proper American one,

15:16.449 --> 15:18.683
like D'Brickashaw
or Mustang Sally.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.518
We'll have
the ceremony here!

15:20.520 --> 15:21.719
We're going to be
godparents.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.054
Can you believe it, Donna?

15:23.056 --> 15:25.523
No.
I don't believe any of this.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.925
I don't believe
you've changed,

15:26.927 --> 15:29.727
and I don't believe
you can be good parents.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.296
Whoops.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.597
(doorbell rings)

15:34.300 --> 15:36.267
Where's Junior?
Oh, he's not here.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.736
He went to his
pole-dancing competition.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.405
What?
Why didn't you stop him?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.307
Me and Walt were out!

15:42.309 --> 15:43.741
(sighs)

15:43.743 --> 15:46.177
At least he somehow
pays for things.

15:48.047 --> 15:51.115
"You are rich in ways
other than money."

15:51.117 --> 15:52.617
Terrible.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.218
Donna, will you run
to the store

15:54.220 --> 15:56.087
and get more fortunate cookies
for the party?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.723
I told you, I'm not
helping with this party.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.725
I can't condone them
running around,

16:00.727 --> 16:02.427
acting like perfect parents

16:02.429 --> 16:04.562
when I know who Dee Dee
and Robert really are.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.331
Donna...
we're God's parents now.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.966
What?

16:07.968 --> 16:09.334
Didn't they make
us God's parents?

16:09.336 --> 16:11.436
No, godparents.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.238
God's parents,
godparent, same thing.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.641
Like I met Reggie parents
at the grocery store.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.911
Reggie dad got them
bloodshot jaundice-y eyes.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.080
Point is, we got
to protect this child.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.448
I don't have
to do anything

16:23.450 --> 16:25.750
but rain Hater-ade
on all you fools.

16:25.752 --> 16:26.784
Whoosh!

16:26.786 --> 16:28.453
That's Hater-ade!

16:28.455 --> 16:30.355
(dance music plays)

16:34.593 --> 16:38.129
Thanks for coming to
the pole-dance regionals!

16:38.131 --> 16:41.265
Hope you guys are
enjoying the bring-your-
own-beer policy,

16:41.267 --> 16:44.135
which may turn out to
have been a horrible
business model.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.770
So, let's make this weirder

16:45.772 --> 16:47.271
by welcoming to the main stage

16:47.273 --> 16:48.806
our first performer,

16:48.808 --> 16:51.175
Cleveland Brown Jr.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.382
What the hell?

17:02.388 --> 17:03.454
Get down from there!

17:03.456 --> 17:04.689
You're a boy!

17:04.691 --> 17:05.990
I'm not a boy.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.558
I'm a dancer!

17:07.560 --> 17:09.027
Cue a horrible song!

17:09.029 --> 17:10.795

He's frowning so much.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.331
Wait. I was upside-down.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.566

18:00.180 --> 18:02.180
Well...
(clears throat)

18:02.182 --> 18:03.848
Anyway,
I apologize, Junior.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.851
This is, regrettably,
what you were meant to do.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.519
Thanks, Grandpa.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.555
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.590
Private dance?

18:15.861 --> 18:18.362
Robert and Dee Dee
are two hours late.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.631
Maybe they're still
on China time.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.966
Because there it's probably...

18:21.968 --> 18:24.769
half past dragon chopstick.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.070
DONNA:
I told you so!

18:26.072 --> 18:28.372
Whoosh! That's Hater-ade!

18:28.374 --> 18:29.907
That's it!

18:29.909 --> 18:31.476
If they want to walk all
over Donna and Rallo,

18:31.478 --> 18:32.777
that's their business.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.445
But if they stand me up...

18:34.447 --> 18:35.980
we've got a problem.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.316
Donna! I'm finally upset!

18:38.318 --> 18:40.585
So, now that a man cares,

18:40.587 --> 18:44.055
let's go do something
about this!

18:44.057 --> 18:45.890
Y'all haven't seen Robert,
have you?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.125
I knew it!

18:47.127 --> 18:48.993
You were terrible parents,

18:48.995 --> 18:51.095
and you'll always be
terrible parents.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.663
Yeah.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.465
And you don't deserve
the Chinese lanterns

18:54.467 --> 18:56.801
or shrimp bubble gum
I got for the ceremony.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.469
The naming ceremony!

18:58.471 --> 19:01.072
We've been so busy,
we completely forgot.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.940
Of course the two of you did.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.076
You're so selfish,
you forget everything.

19:05.078 --> 19:06.811
You forgot you had a daughter,

19:06.813 --> 19:09.080
and Robert forgot
he had a wife.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.915
Mm-hmm.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.917
We really are failures.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.352
I thought we were ready

19:14.354 --> 19:16.287
to be great parents
this time around...

19:16.289 --> 19:18.356
but maybe you're right
about me and Robert.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.524
Where is Robert?

19:19.526 --> 19:21.025
Mm-hmm.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.760
I had to go
to three pharmacies

19:22.762 --> 19:24.162
to find Q.Q.'s
ear medicine.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.763
And that's after spending
all morning

19:25.765 --> 19:27.131
trying to convert
the sex swing

19:27.133 --> 19:29.367
into a bouncy
chair for the kid.
(laughs)

19:29.369 --> 19:32.036
(laughing)

19:32.038 --> 19:34.172
(gasps)

19:38.377 --> 19:40.044
Oh, my God.

19:40.046 --> 19:43.047
You guys really are trying,
aren't you?

19:43.049 --> 19:44.949
Yes. It turns out,
having a kid

19:44.951 --> 19:46.551
doesn't just
crush your dreams.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.952
It's also hard.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.954
Maybe that's why
God doesn't let

19:49.956 --> 19:52.323
women in their
60s have babies.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.325
Oh, Donna,
I was a terrible mother

19:54.327 --> 19:55.793
and I'm so proud of you

19:55.795 --> 19:57.395
for growing up
to be a good one.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.463
I need you to be
my role model.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.566
Will you be
<i>my</i> mother, Donna?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.734
What?!
How would that even work?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.870
You know what? I'm out.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.041
We've got to go rename
Rallo's bruncle.

20:11.977 --> 20:15.079
And as Saul
did become Paul

20:15.081 --> 20:18.182
and Beyoncé
became Sasha Fierce,

20:18.184 --> 20:20.384
so do I christen you,

20:20.386 --> 20:22.987
oh, heathen child
Quack Quack...

20:22.989 --> 20:25.156
by your new name,

20:25.158 --> 20:27.558
Hong Kong Phooey.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.993
'Member him?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.027
Was that
<i>The Pink Panther?</i>

20:30.029 --> 20:31.762
(playing clumsily)

20:34.400 --> 20:36.834
How the hell did we
get stuck with this?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.402
We are dumb.
