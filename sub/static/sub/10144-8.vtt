00:01.437 --> 00:02.414
Walter Lutulu,

00:02.448 --> 00:04.257
leader of the party
for a Democratic Zimbabwe.

00:04.282 --> 00:05.516
Knox is a known supporter.

00:05.550 --> 00:06.817
Walter Lutulu with nukes.

00:06.851 --> 00:07.919
They will need outside help

00:07.953 --> 00:09.284
if they're gonna
make a move on Zimbabwe.

00:09.318 --> 00:10.850
We could be looking at
the beginning of a coup.

00:10.885 --> 00:11.919
Let's start with the CIA.

00:11.953 --> 00:14.122
If the regime had killed Walter,

00:14.156 --> 00:16.658
the opposition planned
to install his daughter

00:16.693 --> 00:18.095
as the
front-runner.

00:18.129 --> 00:20.397
There are clear guidelines about
the treatment of prisoners.

00:22.102 --> 00:23.201
Knox ordered this.

00:23.235 --> 00:26.104
My father... Walter Lutulu!

00:27.138 --> 00:28.137
You were with Conrad Knox.

00:28.171 --> 00:29.538
Did you see any nuclear weapons?

00:29.573 --> 00:30.539
You have to help him!

00:30.574 --> 00:31.840
I'm trying to do the best I can!

00:31.875 --> 00:33.142
This is the man responsible.

00:33.143 --> 00:34.009
He shot Lutulu.

00:47.827 --> 00:50.429
Put the gun on the floor,

00:50.463 --> 00:52.231
nice and slowly.

00:56.204 --> 00:57.137
Slowly.

00:57.172 --> 00:58.605
Ok.

01:01.621 --> 01:03.821
Now get up, slowly.

01:15.329 --> 01:17.705
My name's Michael Stonebridge.

01:17.740 --> 01:20.128
I'm a British Military attaché.

01:21.892 --> 01:23.493
And I need your help.

01:23.527 --> 01:26.097
You've got a funny
way of asking for it.

01:31.219 --> 01:33.736
Here. Take it.

01:38.213 --> 01:39.326
You got some ID?

01:39.361 --> 01:40.743
Nothing you'd believe.

01:40.778 --> 01:43.654
But right now, that's the
least of our worries.

01:50.161 --> 01:52.518
I saw him.
He's in there.

01:54.676 --> 01:58.016
Shit. That mob that's
gathering outside...

01:58.488 --> 01:59.689
This is the man responsible.

01:59.724 --> 02:00.653
He shot Lutulu.

02:00.688 --> 02:01.650
He's lying!

02:01.684 --> 02:02.614
Hey, shut up.

02:02.648 --> 02:03.738
I am a refugee.

02:03.772 --> 02:04.861
This man has beaten and abused me.

02:04.896 --> 02:05.587
Oi!

02:05.622 --> 02:06.582
I demand you lock him up!

02:06.616 --> 02:07.642
You want to go outside?

02:07.677 --> 02:09.056
You want to go outside
and take your chances?

02:09.110 --> 02:09.729
No, no, no, no.

02:09.768 --> 02:11.054
No? Then fucking
get in that cell.

02:11.086 --> 02:12.964
Come here.
Get in the cell.

02:13.003 --> 02:15.043
I should have let them tear your
arms off and beat you to death.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.556
Get in there.

02:24.794 --> 02:25.987
Cheers.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.474
What's your name?

02:29.662 --> 02:30.438
Moses.

02:30.461 --> 02:31.556
- Moses?
- Yeah.

02:31.566 --> 02:32.709
It's nice to meet you.

02:32.744 --> 02:34.530
How many officers do you have here?

02:34.564 --> 02:35.757
You're looking at it.

02:35.791 --> 02:37.511
It's just
a one-man operation.

02:37.545 --> 02:39.039
Ok.

02:39.073 --> 02:41.313
I need you to call for
reinforcements, yeah?

02:41.340 --> 02:42.525
If that mob gets in here,

02:42.571 --> 02:44.934
they're gonna lynch him, and us, too.

Try and track where his
last message came from.

04:19.995 --> 04:21.322
What, with this equipment?

04:27.904 --> 04:28.964
Improvise.

04:29.006 --> 04:32.119
GSW to the
mid-chest and shoulder.

04:32.154 --> 04:34.302
Father, look at me.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.827
Almost certain pneumothorax.

04:35.894 --> 04:36.954
Shoulder through and through.

04:36.988 --> 04:38.507
Tell surgical he'll
need a central line,

04:38.542 --> 04:40.035
and get some blood up for
an urgent cross-match

04:40.102 --> 04:40.862
for 6 units.

04:40.896 --> 04:42.482
Is he going to be ok?

04:42.516 --> 04:43.676
Did you see what he was shot with?

04:43.710 --> 04:45.663
I think it was a 9 mm.

04:45.698 --> 04:47.786
Move back. Clear
the corridor, please.

04:47.918 --> 04:49.211
Patient coming through.

04:51.066 --> 04:53.478
Shit.

05:03.523 --> 05:04.382
You all right?

05:04.417 --> 05:05.376
Yeah.

05:05.410 --> 05:07.923
Call headquarters again.

05:16.307 --> 05:18.455
Whatever you got paid for this...

05:18.523 --> 05:20.159
It wasn't enough.

05:20.193 --> 05:21.863
You'll never live long enough
to spend one cent of it.

05:21.897 --> 05:22.915
Fuck you.

05:23.249 --> 05:25.086
All I want to know:
Who signed you up?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.576
Hey, nobody signed
me up for anything.

05:27.610 --> 05:28.864
Bullshit.

05:28.898 --> 05:31.994
Lutulu?
He's a colonialist puppet.

05:32.028 --> 05:33.836
He deserves to die,

05:33.871 --> 05:36.996
and whoever did it is
a hero of Zimbabwe!

05:37.030 --> 05:41.294
Papa, look at me.
Is he going to be ok?

05:41.336 --> 05:42.486
Look, I'm not going to lie to you.

05:42.554 --> 05:43.526
His wounds are serious,

05:43.561 --> 05:45.245
but whoever helped him
out on the way here

05:45.279 --> 05:47.647
has given him a fighting chance.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.366
I should have been stronger for you.

05:49.406 --> 05:50.393
Don't say this.

05:50.457 --> 05:51.420
I'm sorry, but I've got to ask...

05:51.454 --> 05:52.384
Do you know the man that shot you?

05:52.418 --> 05:53.515
Sir, you're gonna have to step back.

05:53.549 --> 05:54.312
Look, I'm a journo.

05:54.346 --> 05:55.406
I've got to ask these questions.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.333
Step back!

05:56.368 --> 05:57.395
Sorry.

05:57.430 --> 05:59.921
You can't die.
We made plans.

05:59.955 --> 06:01.220
Don't leave me.

06:02.357 --> 06:04.930
You have to stay with me, papa.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.538
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

06:09.241 --> 06:10.679
He killed him!

06:10.713 --> 06:11.620
Aah!

06:12.663 --> 06:13.571
Father!

06:13.639 --> 06:14.877
Fuck you!

06:14.911 --> 06:17.772
Papa! No!

06:17.840 --> 06:19.838
No, papa!

06:19.872 --> 06:21.770
Come here. Come here.

06:21.869 --> 06:23.488
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Lilian, come with me.

06:23.543 --> 06:24.821
- Come with me!
- Papa!

06:24.856 --> 06:25.871
I'm sorry.
We got to go.

06:25.939 --> 06:26.788
No!

06:33.269 --> 06:35.144
Lilian, come on.
Down there.

06:36.408 --> 06:38.135
Fuck! Aah! Aah!

06:41.576 --> 06:43.949
Lilian! Come on!
Go down!

06:45.986 --> 06:47.353
Go, go, go! Move!

06:47.388 --> 06:49.956
Lilian!

06:49.990 --> 06:51.591
Lilian!

06:56.698 --> 06:58.866
Shit. Come on.

06:59.768 --> 07:01.468
Hold up. Hold up.

07:03.638 --> 07:04.871
Fuck. Come on.

07:06.808 --> 07:08.375
Just stick with me.

07:08.409 --> 07:11.545
Wait. Wait.

07:11.579 --> 07:13.480
All right, come this way.
Come on.

07:35.101 --> 07:36.935
Miss Lutulu!

07:38.571 --> 07:40.238
Lilian!

07:42.207 --> 07:43.340
My name's Craig Hanson!

07:43.375 --> 07:46.409
I've been sent by Conrad Knox!

07:46.443 --> 07:47.676
Come on.

07:47.710 --> 07:49.677
All I want is to
take you to Mr. Knox.

07:49.712 --> 07:51.646
You're not safe.

07:51.681 --> 07:53.048
Lilian.

07:53.082 --> 07:56.050
I wouldn't listen
to the man you're with.

07:56.085 --> 07:58.619
Lilian. Lilian, please.
Please, do not listen to him.

07:58.654 --> 07:59.785
He knows Conrad.

07:59.817 --> 08:02.256
He works for the Zimbabweans
who killed your father!

08:02.291 --> 08:03.791
He's a killer, too!

08:03.825 --> 08:06.061
Come here.
Come here! Come on!

08:06.096 --> 08:08.736
That's it.
Just stick with me.

08:08.771 --> 08:10.238
Lilian.

08:15.242 --> 08:16.375
You've been set up.

08:16.410 --> 08:17.676
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:17.744 --> 08:18.977
Where was your getaway driver, hmm?

08:19.012 --> 08:21.513
Your backup team, your exfil plan?

08:21.547 --> 08:24.349
Face it... somebody
wanted you dead.

08:25.384 --> 08:28.019
Your tattoo...

08:28.053 --> 08:30.054
First Combat Battalion, right?

08:30.088 --> 08:31.288
Zimbabwean Special Forces.

08:31.323 --> 08:32.289
Yeah.

08:32.323 --> 08:33.789
You guys were a tough unit.

08:33.825 --> 08:35.024
Yeah.

08:36.957 --> 08:39.993
Your only option is to talk to me.

08:40.027 --> 08:41.094
I know what's going on.

08:41.128 --> 08:43.563
I've been there myself.

08:43.597 --> 08:44.564
I just want to know,

08:44.598 --> 08:46.732
does Conrad Knox play in any of this?

08:48.969 --> 08:53.105
Hey. No one
is coming anytime soon.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.041
We're on our own.

08:58.878 --> 09:00.778
Fuck me. Dead end.

09:00.812 --> 09:02.880
Back here.
Just hide there.

09:02.906 --> 09:04.664
Shit. Shit.

09:14.559 --> 09:17.927
Stay there.
Just stay there.

09:20.831 --> 09:22.431
Who's the killer now, big man?

09:22.465 --> 09:24.699
Shut up, Hanson.

09:24.733 --> 09:25.900
You're a fucking dead man.

09:25.934 --> 09:26.968
Do you hear that, Lilian?

09:27.002 --> 09:29.070
You saw what I saw.

09:29.104 --> 09:30.905
I'm not the one shooting.

09:30.939 --> 09:32.406
Don't listen to him, Lilian.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.976
His men are the ones
that killed your father.

09:35.010 --> 09:36.410
I wouldn't listen to a word he says.

09:36.445 --> 09:37.911
Whatever he is saying is a lie.

09:37.946 --> 09:40.280
Why don't you go do
something useful, Hanson?

09:40.315 --> 09:41.715
Go donate some body parts.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.550
I hear they're looking for assholes.

09:44.102 --> 09:45.185
Lilian.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.288
I'm unarmed.
I'm gonna come out.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.059
Don't trust him, Lilian.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.892
I'm coming out, Lilian.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.630
Here I come.

10:02.068 --> 10:05.270
I'm not gonna
hurt you. I'm not.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.174
Easy.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.809
I've just been sent for your protection.
That's it.

10:11.843 --> 10:12.943
Mr. Knox is on
the line right now.

10:12.978 --> 10:14.578
You can ask him yourself.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.614
That's bullshit.
Lilian, stay there.

10:17.648 --> 10:20.616
What the fuck is your game, Hanson?

10:20.651 --> 10:23.219
Just showing Lilian who the
good guy is in this situation.

10:23.254 --> 10:24.689
What are you gonna
do... shoot me?

10:24.729 --> 10:26.155
Yeah.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.292
- What have you done?
- Come here! Come here!

10:29.326 --> 10:31.460
Are you crazy?
He was unarmed!

10:31.495 --> 10:32.861
Move. Move!

10:32.896 --> 10:35.130
Lilian. Fuck.

10:42.504 --> 10:43.871
Aah!

10:45.407 --> 10:46.974
Come here. Fuck.

10:47.008 --> 10:49.542
Kevlar? Fucking pussy.

10:53.847 --> 10:56.014
Fuck!

11:09.894 --> 11:11.294
Fuck!

11:18.001 --> 11:20.035
Aaah!

11:29.777 --> 11:32.979
Stay with me, all right?

11:33.013 --> 11:35.014
Mr. Lutulu, who was
recently broken out of

11:35.048 --> 11:37.416
a high-security prison
in Harare,

11:37.484 --> 11:39.885
was gunned down today
at a pro-democracy rally

11:39.919 --> 11:41.653
in Bukhoma Township.

11:41.688 --> 11:42.820
We'll have more later.

11:42.889 --> 11:44.123
Much more.

11:45.926 --> 11:48.093
Yup?

11:48.128 --> 11:49.161
But in other news...

11:49.195 --> 11:50.095
Major, it's Stonebridge.

11:50.129 --> 11:51.830
Put him on speaker.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.233
Bravo Two.

11:56.268 --> 11:57.501
I haven't fully IDed the shooter,

11:57.535 --> 11:59.269
but he's ex-Zimbabwe
Special Forces.

11:59.304 --> 12:00.504
Who sent him?

12:00.538 --> 12:01.671
He isn't saying.

12:01.706 --> 12:03.640
Whoever did, they set him up.

12:03.674 --> 12:05.842
He was waiting for support
that never arrived.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.844
He's pro Mugabe, fanatical.

12:07.878 --> 12:08.845
"Cui bono"?

12:08.879 --> 12:10.813
Yeah. Who benefits?

12:10.848 --> 12:12.515
The current regime.

12:12.549 --> 12:13.649
They eliminate a rival,

12:13.684 --> 12:15.384
they get a free run
at the next election.

12:15.419 --> 12:16.619
No.
It's too easy.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.854
They control the electoral
process anyway.

12:18.888 --> 12:20.354
Too wily to pull
something this public.

12:20.401 --> 12:21.823
This assassination is
gonna bring a firestorm

12:21.858 --> 12:23.792
down on their heads.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.159
Where were Matlock's bodyguards

12:25.194 --> 12:26.560
when Lutulu made his speech?

12:26.595 --> 12:27.740
No, there was no one there.

12:27.779 --> 12:28.990
Scott and I would have noticed.

12:29.031 --> 12:33.535
Knox breaks him out and then
leaves him exposed. Why?

12:33.768 --> 12:37.071
This was never about Walter
Lutulu taking over Zimbabwe.

12:37.105 --> 12:39.106
This is about Conrad Knox.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.274
Following the
assassination of Walter Lutulu,

12:41.342 --> 12:42.742
a wave of unrest

12:42.776 --> 12:45.444
amongst the displaced Zimbabwean
community in South Africa

12:45.478 --> 12:48.747
is spreading north to the
borders of Zimbabwe itself.

12:48.782 --> 12:50.149
Whilst denying any responsibility

12:50.183 --> 12:51.717
for Mr. Lutulu's murder,

12:51.751 --> 12:54.119
a spokesman for
the ruling Zanu-PF Party

12:54.153 --> 12:56.120
has squashed any talk
of negotiating...

13:06.963 --> 13:08.330
Moses?

13:08.364 --> 13:09.497
Here they come!

13:09.532 --> 13:10.665
How are we doing for ammo?

13:10.699 --> 13:14.802
Listen here. Listen.
I know these people.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.670
I don't want to kill them.

13:16.705 --> 13:18.572
We've got some less
lethal options here.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.741
Yeah. I've never
seen the point, myself.

13:20.775 --> 13:22.909
Here.

13:22.943 --> 13:24.043
NMls?

13:24.078 --> 13:25.745
Electric shock.

13:25.779 --> 13:26.746
Do they work?

13:27.881 --> 13:30.516
I volunteered when they
were testing them.

13:30.550 --> 13:31.717
Trust me, my friend,

13:31.751 --> 13:34.018
they will stop even the
most committed of men.

13:44.494 --> 13:45.760
Come with me.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.799
Get in that ambulance.

13:55.802 --> 13:56.902
Hey, shh, shh, shh.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.441
It's just a dead body.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.543
Fuck.

14:27.772 --> 14:29.839
Who are you?

14:29.873 --> 14:31.940
My name is Damien Scott.

14:32.008 --> 14:34.241
I work for British
Military Intelligence.

14:34.276 --> 14:35.876
You're American.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.878
It's kind of a long story.

14:41.912 --> 14:43.579
What were British
Military Intelligence

14:43.614 --> 14:46.881
doing in Bukhoma, hmm?

14:46.915 --> 14:49.883
We got a lead on your buddy Knox.

14:52.218 --> 14:53.217
We were there to apprehend him.

14:53.252 --> 14:55.185
Why?

14:55.219 --> 14:58.321
He's got ahold of
some nuclear triggers

14:58.355 --> 15:00.088
for WMDs.

15:00.122 --> 15:04.357
Conrad?
That's ridiculous.

15:04.392 --> 15:09.127
It might sound
like that to you, but...

15:09.161 --> 15:10.961
I'm telling you the truth.

15:10.995 --> 15:15.396
That was us that saved
you outside your office.

15:16.297 --> 15:18.598
You?

15:18.666 --> 15:20.866
The guy that intervened...

15:23.068 --> 15:25.501
His name was Sinclair.

15:25.536 --> 15:28.603
He worked with us.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.571
Right now, he's lying in a morgue.

15:31.606 --> 15:33.740
Conrad had him killed.

15:57.754 --> 15:59.120
Reinforcements.

15:59.188 --> 16:00.754
It's about bloody time.

16:03.589 --> 16:04.556
On your word.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.056
Go.

16:14.495 --> 16:17.630
Go home before someone dies!

16:17.664 --> 16:20.064
Walter Lutulu was a man of peace!

16:20.099 --> 16:22.533
He would not have wanted this.

16:31.172 --> 16:32.772
Aah!

16:36.475 --> 16:38.742
Get those cops.
You bring them in.

16:41.777 --> 16:43.944
Let's go. Let's go.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.013
Come on, come on, come on.

16:49.047 --> 16:50.933
Moses, get inside.
I've got this. Go, go!

16:52.345 --> 16:53.313
Give me the keys, please.

16:53.355 --> 16:54.517
Ok.

16:54.551 --> 16:55.817
Keys. Key.

16:58.487 --> 16:59.753
Ok. Ok.

16:59.788 --> 17:01.554
Looks like a fair
bit of action here today.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.355
This one.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.923
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.

17:06.957 --> 17:08.692
Well, take them if you have to.

17:08.726 --> 17:10.492
Where do I sign, this form?

17:10.527 --> 17:12.193
Yeah, this half.

17:12.228 --> 17:14.328
Where are you taking him?

17:14.362 --> 17:17.563
I'm taking the prisoner
to the headquarters.

17:17.597 --> 17:19.631
Is that the Samuelson
Building on Long Street?

17:19.665 --> 17:22.632
Yeah, yeah. Yeah,
that's the one. Yeah.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.867
That's funny.
I thought the, uh, Cape Town HQ

17:24.901 --> 17:26.601
was on the corner of, uh,

17:26.635 --> 17:29.136
Buitenkant and Albertus.

17:31.205 --> 17:32.938
Hey, man, it's been a hectic day, eh?

17:32.972 --> 17:35.239
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I bet.

17:35.274 --> 17:36.507
Chaos everywhere.

17:36.541 --> 17:38.241
Yeah.

17:38.276 --> 17:39.442
Aah!

17:39.476 --> 17:40.710
Moses, they're not cops!

17:42.378 --> 17:43.678
Moses, get down!

17:44.613 --> 17:45.579
What the fuck?

17:45.613 --> 17:47.180
Moses, get down!

17:49.650 --> 17:50.749
Moses, get the fuck down!

17:50.784 --> 17:51.950
Shut up!

17:54.052 --> 17:55.785
Shut up!
I'll fucking kill him!

17:55.820 --> 17:57.619
Get the fuck down!

18:01.721 --> 18:04.221
I'm ready to talk!

18:05.490 --> 18:07.161
I'm ready to talk!

18:07.195 --> 18:09.037
No shit.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.284
You all right?

18:14.319 --> 18:15.720
Yeah.

18:32.035 --> 18:33.769
Is he dead?

18:35.371 --> 18:37.706
Kohl, did you get him?
Is he dead?

18:39.676 --> 18:42.277
No. She is.

18:53.454 --> 18:55.755
See if you can persuade
Lilian to come here.

18:55.789 --> 18:57.957
As you can guess,
she's pretty shaken up.

18:57.991 --> 18:59.625
I don't know if
questioning her right now

18:59.693 --> 19:00.659
is the best idea.

19:00.727 --> 19:03.595
Scott, do whatever you have to.

19:03.629 --> 19:05.330
Just get her here.

19:16.608 --> 19:18.942
Oi. Your turn.

19:18.977 --> 19:23.146
Look, the people who hired me...

19:23.180 --> 19:24.480
I know where they have their base.

19:24.514 --> 19:27.016
Get me out of here, and
I'll take you there.

19:27.049 --> 19:29.117
Who hired you?

19:29.151 --> 19:30.184
Who hired you?!

19:30.219 --> 19:33.621
Matlock!
It was Karl Matlock.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.492
Now.

19:53.805 --> 19:56.774
Let me out! I'm a trained soldier!
I can help!

20:02.512 --> 20:04.646
Moses, move! Move!
Moses, get down!

20:13.221 --> 20:14.722
Aah...

20:35.341 --> 20:38.610
God.

20:58.961 --> 21:01.462
Just do it.

21:01.497 --> 21:03.030
Just do it.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.639
No, no, no, no!

21:15.708 --> 21:16.641
Aah!

21:49.603 --> 21:50.670
Reaction to the shooting

21:50.704 --> 21:52.705
has been unanimous
in its condemnation.

21:52.739 --> 21:55.375
In Washington, the Secretary
of State moved swiftly

21:55.409 --> 21:57.076
to condemn the attack.

21:57.110 --> 22:00.246
She stopped short of calling
for military intervention

22:00.280 --> 22:02.179
but supported calls
for the ruling Zanu Party

22:02.213 --> 22:03.682
to step down.

22:03.716 --> 22:06.618
What did I tell you, Conrad?

22:06.652 --> 22:09.120
You've achieved more for
Zimbabwe with one bullet

22:09.154 --> 22:11.622
than you will with those weapons.

22:19.496 --> 22:20.863
Can I assume that Walter's killer

22:20.898 --> 22:22.932
has met his just deserts?

22:22.966 --> 22:24.600
Yes, sir.

22:24.634 --> 22:26.401
And 20's man?

22:27.737 --> 22:29.270
At my mercy.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.272
When we've secured Lilian,
you can dispose of him

22:31.306 --> 22:33.373
in any way you like,

22:33.408 --> 22:35.342
but until then, he remains

22:35.376 --> 22:37.277
our most valuable asset.

22:37.311 --> 22:38.678
He killed Kohl.

22:38.712 --> 22:40.579
I'm sorry to hear that,

22:40.614 --> 22:43.015
but I don't want to weaken
my bargaining position

22:43.049 --> 22:46.084
while I have a deal to negotiate.

23:06.001 --> 23:08.436
We have to go back.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.471
We can't.
It's not safe.

23:11.539 --> 23:14.608
I need to be with my father.

23:14.642 --> 23:15.842
Lilian, you...

23:17.978 --> 23:20.180
The people I work with

23:20.214 --> 23:22.682
would like to see you.

23:22.716 --> 23:23.783
Just let me take you in there,

23:23.817 --> 23:26.853
and they'll give you
the background on Knox.

23:34.727 --> 23:36.127
Go ahead, cocksucker.

23:36.161 --> 23:38.529
You listen to me.

23:38.563 --> 23:40.230
I have your friend.

23:41.565 --> 23:43.566
You want him to live,
you bring the girl

23:43.634 --> 23:45.435
to the abandoned textile factory

23:45.503 --> 23:47.070
at Manenberg.

23:48.172 --> 23:51.074
Fuck me over, you'll
be picking him up

23:51.108 --> 23:53.042
in a body bag.

23:58.281 --> 23:59.815
Shit.

23:59.850 --> 24:01.417
What's wrong?

24:01.485 --> 24:02.752
It's Knox's man.

24:02.786 --> 24:05.621
He wants to do an exchange.

24:05.655 --> 24:06.954
You for my partner.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.589
But don't you worry.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

24:08.623 --> 24:10.823
I'm not worried.

24:10.858 --> 24:14.722
If you don't take me, I'll go myself.

24:16.658 --> 24:19.494
I need to see Conrad.

24:22.030 --> 24:23.363
So do I.

24:25.332 --> 24:27.333
Zero, are you getting all this?

24:27.367 --> 24:29.401
Let her do it.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.103
It might even work in our favor.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.137
For Christ's sake,

24:33.171 --> 24:35.472
get Stonebridge out of there.

24:35.506 --> 24:38.008
Baxter, get kitted up
and get down there.

24:38.042 --> 24:39.075
He'll need your support.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.043
Yes, ma'am.

24:57.327 --> 24:59.361
Come on, Michael.
Come on.

25:18.645 --> 25:20.646
I'm here.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.214
You give me Stonebridge,
I give you the girl.

25:23.249 --> 25:25.416
You don't make the rules here.

25:29.116 --> 25:30.283
Fucker.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.220
Go.

25:47.031 --> 25:48.831
Get out.

26:13.421 --> 26:16.256
Hold your positions.
Wait for my command.

26:41.579 --> 26:43.246
Damien says "Duck."

26:43.281 --> 26:44.714
Huh?

26:54.358 --> 26:55.558
Give me cover fire!

26:56.927 --> 26:58.928
There he is.
Get him, get him, get him!

27:08.869 --> 27:10.637
Get in!

27:10.671 --> 27:12.605
You all right, Mikey?

27:13.674 --> 27:15.141
Did you like
that one? Huh?

27:15.209 --> 27:17.276
Ha ha ha!

27:50.538 --> 27:53.206
Lilian.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.741
Are you all right?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.843
I'm so sorry.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.444
It's all my fault.

27:59.478 --> 28:00.945
It's your fault?

28:00.979 --> 28:05.050
Well, inasmuch as I
couldn't save Walter, yes.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.118
Inasmuch as I couldn't
marshal all the resources

28:07.153 --> 28:10.224
at my disposal to protect him, yes.

28:11.863 --> 28:14.932
All the warning signs were there.

28:14.966 --> 28:17.834
I promise you, we won't
take any more risks.

28:17.868 --> 28:20.436
While I have breath in my body,

28:20.471 --> 28:23.639
I'll do all I can to protect you.

28:23.673 --> 28:25.340
The American
I was with... he...

28:26.342 --> 28:27.977
It was Damien Scott.

28:30.546 --> 28:31.980
You know him?

28:35.718 --> 28:36.984
Where did you get this?

28:37.019 --> 28:39.353
Christy Bryant.

28:39.387 --> 28:42.222
She's CIA, too.

28:42.256 --> 28:43.490
You know her, I believe.

28:43.557 --> 28:44.991
We've met.

28:48.729 --> 28:50.329
Well, then you know
that there are elements

28:50.364 --> 28:53.332
in that organization

28:53.366 --> 28:57.769
that are less morally
scrupulous than others.

28:57.803 --> 29:03.974
Now, I suspect Scott contracted
himself out to the regime.

29:04.008 --> 29:06.409
And they wanted him to remove
Walter once and for all.

29:06.443 --> 29:08.310
But he tried to help my father.

29:08.345 --> 29:10.545
He may have wanted you to
think he was helping him.

29:10.580 --> 29:13.947
But he did help.
He protected me.

29:13.982 --> 29:15.215
He shot the killers.

29:15.249 --> 29:16.783
He rescued me from the law center.

29:16.818 --> 29:18.084
That was him.

29:18.119 --> 29:19.952
Lilian, there are people
who run this continent

29:19.987 --> 29:22.020
as if it were their own.

29:23.589 --> 29:26.359
Your father knew that
more than anyone.

29:26.394 --> 29:31.031
But his work needn't...
mustn't end here.

29:31.066 --> 29:32.333
There's a growing clamor.

29:32.367 --> 29:34.935
The people will rally behind you.

29:34.969 --> 29:38.238
You're your father's daughter.

29:44.145 --> 29:45.378
Are you ok?

29:45.413 --> 29:47.080
Thanks, bud.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

29:47.114 --> 29:47.856
Let me see.

29:47.895 --> 29:50.016
Here at home, fresh
discoveries have been made

29:50.050 --> 29:51.351
in the hunt for the assassins

29:51.385 --> 29:52.951
of Zimbabwean dissident
Walter Lutulu.

29:52.986 --> 29:54.252
Yeah.

29:54.287 --> 29:57.321
The body of Ministerial
Attaché Joseph Dreyer

29:57.356 --> 29:59.790
has been discovered
at an address in Cape Town.

29:59.824 --> 30:00.824
He had been shot.

30:00.892 --> 30:02.025
Poor thing.

30:02.059 --> 30:03.393
The police have issued
images of two men...

30:03.427 --> 30:04.060
Shit.

30:04.095 --> 30:06.229
Wanted in connection
with both murders.

30:06.264 --> 30:07.930
We're famous.

30:07.965 --> 30:11.934
My mommy's gonna be so proud.

30:11.968 --> 30:13.202
She'd be a lot more proud

30:13.236 --> 30:15.470
if you'd found those nukes.

30:15.505 --> 30:16.771
The last thing we need at this stage

30:16.806 --> 30:18.739
is you two muppets in the spotlight.

30:18.774 --> 30:21.475
Muppets?

30:23.044 --> 30:24.110
Come here.

30:35.889 --> 30:37.957
What? What?

30:42.060 --> 30:44.828
Conrad was a valued friend,

30:44.862 --> 30:48.698
but his designs on my country
are not what he pretends.

30:48.732 --> 30:51.200
He wants power,

30:51.234 --> 30:54.736
and he has kept
his true plans from me.

30:54.771 --> 30:57.138
I now know that he would
contaminate Zimbabwe

30:57.172 --> 30:59.073
with nuclear weapons.

30:59.107 --> 31:02.043
When I confronted him,
I saw how dangerous

31:02.077 --> 31:04.110
he has become,

31:04.144 --> 31:06.647
but I will not yield,

31:06.682 --> 31:10.317
no matter what the consequences
are for me.

31:14.856 --> 31:15.989
There was a problem

31:16.023 --> 31:18.158
with the engineering
in one of the pieces.

31:18.192 --> 31:21.327
These components
were not made to fit.

31:21.362 --> 31:23.329
But I can adjust it.

31:23.363 --> 31:26.332
However, there is no guarantee
it will still work.

31:26.366 --> 31:27.366
Right. Brother,
you, too.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.367
Of course.

31:29.401 --> 31:31.435
Load them...

31:31.469 --> 31:32.869
Did you set that up?

31:32.903 --> 31:33.870
Set what up?

31:33.904 --> 31:37.339
The call I just got from the CDZ.

31:37.374 --> 31:39.074
They want me to lead the party.

31:39.109 --> 31:41.110
That's wonderful!

31:41.177 --> 31:43.412
Of course I didn't set it up.

31:43.446 --> 31:45.680
The people are giving
you their voices,

31:45.715 --> 31:47.182
their mandate.

31:47.216 --> 31:50.718
Surely you're not surprised.

31:50.752 --> 31:52.652
Are you not prepared for this?

31:52.687 --> 31:54.955
All of it?

31:54.989 --> 31:56.523
Yes.

31:56.590 --> 31:59.325
Yes, I am, but there's
work to be done.

31:59.359 --> 32:00.392
Mm-hmm.

32:00.427 --> 32:02.227
Can you arrange a press conference?

32:02.261 --> 32:03.561
The people will expect it.

32:03.595 --> 32:04.762
Yes. Yes,
of course I can.

32:04.796 --> 32:07.198
And I need to spend some
time with my father.

32:07.232 --> 32:09.499
I can't leave without
saying good-bye.

32:09.534 --> 32:10.800
No, no, you must.

32:10.834 --> 32:15.570
Tomorrow is a new dawn, hmm?

32:22.211 --> 32:23.411
About fucking time.

32:23.445 --> 32:25.579
Sorry.
It's all they had left.

32:25.614 --> 32:27.180
- Here.
- Cheers.

32:27.215 --> 32:28.915
- What'd you get?
- Thank you, Baxter.

32:31.952 --> 32:33.286
So what's the plan?

32:33.320 --> 32:34.720
Dreyer can't have been the only guy

32:34.754 --> 32:35.354
in Knox's pocket.

32:35.388 --> 32:36.722
I mean, he's dead, right?

32:36.756 --> 32:38.557
And they're still issuing
statements about us.

32:38.591 --> 32:40.526
Well, then who do we go looking for?

32:41.861 --> 32:44.562
Sinclair would have had
the answer to that.

32:44.597 --> 32:47.031
Get me a list of everyone
in the interior ministry.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.100
Who to target, who to
watch, who to follow.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.401
Sure.

32:50.435 --> 32:52.636
Shit.
Maybe we should have kept Dreyer alive.

32:52.670 --> 32:53.937
No, we shouldn't have.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.076
Huh.

33:00.110 --> 33:02.511
Something to share with the class?

33:02.545 --> 33:04.513
Yeah.

33:04.548 --> 33:06.115
That's Lilian.

33:06.149 --> 33:07.816
She wants to meet.

33:12.890 --> 33:16.725
Papa...

33:16.760 --> 33:18.861
I miss you.

33:45.852 --> 33:47.386
Hello.

33:47.420 --> 33:48.654
Hi.

33:49.656 --> 33:51.323
I can't talk long.

33:52.725 --> 33:54.993
What is it that you
wanted to see me about?

33:55.995 --> 33:57.829
You were right...

33:59.326 --> 34:01.027
about Conrad.

34:05.403 --> 34:07.871
I found my father's diary.

34:09.373 --> 34:15.166
In it, he describes how he
found Knox's nuclear weapons.

34:22.972 --> 34:27.940
Kill Knox for me.

34:29.708 --> 34:32.009
I know you can do it.

34:32.944 --> 34:35.277
I have seen your file.

34:36.344 --> 34:39.911
If you do,

34:39.946 --> 34:42.447
I will tell you where he is,

34:42.481 --> 34:45.483
where the weapons are,

34:45.550 --> 34:49.851
but you've got
to promise... to kill Knox.

34:57.958 --> 35:00.959
Thank you for coming.

35:00.993 --> 35:03.894
I'll try to keep this brief.

35:06.896 --> 35:10.530
3 days ago, my father
fled to this country

35:10.564 --> 35:16.466
to begin the fight
for a freer, fairer Zimbabwe.

35:16.500 --> 35:21.235
Two days later,
not half a mile from this spot,

35:21.269 --> 35:23.069
he was gunned down.

35:25.171 --> 35:28.006
His killers may have taken
my father's life,

35:28.074 --> 35:32.042
but what they cannot take
is his legacy.

35:32.077 --> 35:34.411
The press will love her.

35:34.445 --> 35:37.613
She will make for a
more malleable partner?

35:37.647 --> 35:40.681
She's a woman.

35:40.716 --> 35:44.917
I wouldn't presume to imagine
that I could control her.

35:44.951 --> 35:47.051
All his political life.

35:47.086 --> 35:49.552
I have been invited
to assume leadership...

35:55.056 --> 35:58.624
I can't pretend
to have my father's strength...

35:58.692 --> 36:00.792
Well, she's strong enough.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.227
How can you be so sure?

36:02.261 --> 36:03.928
Trust me.

36:03.996 --> 36:08.164
I know a capable woman
when I see one.

36:08.198 --> 36:11.200
His dream of
a truly democratic Zimbabwe.

36:11.234 --> 36:17.336
But men betrayed the dream
that had brought them together.

36:22.906 --> 36:27.642
Indeed, it was a former friend

36:27.676 --> 36:30.276
who took my father's life.

36:30.311 --> 36:34.646
That man's name...

36:34.680 --> 36:37.081
is Conrad Knox.

36:37.115 --> 36:38.615
What?

36:38.649 --> 36:41.690
Conrad claims to be
a friend of Africa,

36:41.772 --> 36:45.033
but he seeks only to bend
Zimbabwe and its people

36:45.069 --> 36:46.369
to his will

36:46.465 --> 36:49.276
in the pursuit of wealth and power...

36:49.421 --> 36:54.823
Power he would protect and
defend with a nuclear arsenal.

36:54.857 --> 36:57.925
She knew.
She fucking knew!

37:07.630 --> 37:10.564
All right,
you approach from the rear.

37:10.599 --> 37:11.631
Richmond, Baxter, circle round.

37:11.666 --> 37:13.532
I'll take up sniper position.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.566
If you find the triggers,

37:14.601 --> 37:16.734
make every attempt to secure them.

37:16.769 --> 37:18.701
Terminate anyone who tries
to stop you.

37:19.803 --> 37:21.069
Finally.

37:21.104 --> 37:23.704
Except Knox.

37:23.738 --> 37:24.970
I want Knox taken alive.

37:25.005 --> 37:27.772
All right. Move out,

38:02.351 --> 38:05.051
Bravo Two, on me.

38:12.557 --> 38:16.899
When my father found out,
Knox had him killed.

38:16.933 --> 38:18.234
I should never have trusted her.

38:18.268 --> 38:20.035
I should never have listened to you.

38:20.103 --> 38:21.270
I could have persuaded Walter.

38:21.304 --> 38:22.438
I could have won him round.

38:22.472 --> 38:23.706
There was no need to have...

38:23.740 --> 38:26.074
If she betrayed you this publicly,

38:26.142 --> 38:27.876
she'll have betrayed you privately.

38:27.910 --> 38:30.311
I suggest you take
suitable precautions.

38:30.345 --> 38:31.846
No, wait.

38:34.849 --> 38:36.416
Go.

38:44.258 --> 38:49.261
Greg, Joe, cover the left flank.

38:49.295 --> 38:52.196
Bravo 3 and 4, to me, to me.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.368
On my command, you go
around the tent, all right?

39:01.304 --> 39:02.904
This location's been compromised.

39:02.939 --> 39:04.239
Prepare for immediate evac.

39:04.307 --> 39:05.540
Yes, commander.

39:05.574 --> 39:06.841
Go.

39:18.186 --> 39:19.853
We can still do this.

39:19.888 --> 39:21.188
Without the benefit of surprise?

39:21.222 --> 39:23.156
Without the people on your side?

39:23.191 --> 39:25.258
Without a leader?

39:25.293 --> 39:26.326
There are other leaders,

39:26.360 --> 39:28.027
other men we could approach.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.828
I could do it.

39:29.896 --> 39:32.264
It's over, Conrad.

39:32.298 --> 39:38.402
And I promise you...
I will not rest...

39:38.436 --> 39:43.807
until the blood of
my father is avenged...

39:43.841 --> 39:47.043
and justice is done.

39:47.077 --> 39:48.277
Fuck! Where the fuck
are you, Knox?

39:48.311 --> 39:52.715
This is Bravo One. I've got
no visual on Knox.

39:52.749 --> 39:54.983
Be advised, Bravo One.

39:55.018 --> 39:58.120
X-ray approaching your position.
Over.

39:58.154 --> 39:59.988
Aah!

40:02.057 --> 40:04.592
- Aah!
- Coming down!

40:04.626 --> 40:06.060
Ooh!

40:09.897 --> 40:11.797
Bravo Two, coming to you.

40:14.668 --> 40:15.968
Shit.

40:19.471 --> 40:20.606
Unh!

40:20.640 --> 40:22.441
Aah!

40:23.709 --> 40:25.376
Unh!

40:38.021 --> 40:39.688
Aargh!

40:43.192 --> 40:44.358
Unh!

40:44.393 --> 40:45.926
Secure the perimeter! Move it!

40:45.961 --> 40:47.861
Go!

40:50.264 --> 40:51.329
Gaah!

40:51.363 --> 40:52.565
How you doing, bud?

40:52.599 --> 40:53.924
Yeah, good. Moving!

40:53.979 --> 40:55.400
Come!

40:59.371 --> 41:01.906
Unh! Unh!

41:04.475 --> 41:07.043
Zero, I've got eyes on target now.

41:07.077 --> 41:08.911
Pursue and secure,
Bravo One-Two.

41:08.946 --> 41:11.447
Mikey, there's a truck
at our 2:00 being loaded.

41:11.481 --> 41:12.648
Go for it?

41:12.682 --> 41:14.383
Go! Move it!

41:14.417 --> 41:16.317
Unh!

41:18.287 --> 41:21.389
More guns! Quick!
Quick!

41:24.359 --> 41:26.360
Mikey, the truck's leaving!

41:31.500 --> 41:32.500
Got us some wheels.

41:38.874 --> 41:41.379
Get the fuck out!

41:41.413 --> 41:43.348
Move, move, move!

41:43.382 --> 41:45.117
Yaah!

41:46.419 --> 41:47.819
Fuck!

42:04.700 --> 42:06.500
Aah!

42:08.937 --> 42:10.871
Aargh!

42:10.905 --> 42:12.572
Move!

42:42.568 --> 42:44.302
Unh!

42:52.977 --> 42:54.511
Aah!

43:03.018 --> 43:03.918
Get a bit closer.

43:03.952 --> 43:05.920
Copy that.

43:05.954 --> 43:08.622
Yah! Unh!

43:11.492 --> 43:12.959
Unh!

43:16.395 --> 43:17.528
Hanson!

43:17.596 --> 43:18.696
It's Matlock!

43:18.730 --> 43:19.930
We've been hit by 20!

43:24.269 --> 43:26.036
Fuck me!

43:26.070 --> 43:28.771
Jesus fucking Christ!

43:30.207 --> 43:32.474
Scott, you get me
as close as you can, yeah?

43:32.509 --> 43:33.875
Got it.

43:49.552 --> 43:50.684
Ok, good!

43:50.719 --> 43:53.653
Stop the fucking truck right now!
Stop it! Fuck!

43:53.687 --> 43:55.921
Pull over!
Pull the fucking truck over!

43:58.524 --> 44:00.592
Engine. Cut the engine
off right now.

44:00.626 --> 44:01.625
Fuck.

44:01.693 --> 44:02.892
Careful.

44:02.926 --> 44:04.559
Turn it off.

44:04.594 --> 44:07.295
Mike, got him. Got him.

44:07.362 --> 44:08.629
Throw the fucking keys.

44:08.663 --> 44:09.630
You got 'em?

44:09.664 --> 44:11.632
Yeah.

44:17.272 --> 44:19.327
What you got back there?

44:21.447 --> 44:22.778
What you got, Mikey?

44:22.846 --> 44:24.608
Shit!

44:27.404 --> 44:30.832
Zero, target retrieved.

44:30.866 --> 44:32.197
You got 'em?

44:32.232 --> 44:33.296
Just the one.

44:33.330 --> 44:35.457
All right. What's that,
one down, 3 to go?

44:35.491 --> 44:37.189
Fuck.

44:37.224 --> 44:38.552
And Knox?

44:38.586 --> 44:40.018
No, that's a negative.

44:40.052 --> 44:42.114
He's long gone.

44:45.144 --> 44:47.438
Nice fucking jump, buddy!

44:47.472 --> 44:48.703
Ha ha!

44:48.737 --> 44:50.202
Shit.

45:04.015 --> 45:07.142
Hey.

45:07.177 --> 45:08.672
I'm sorry.

45:08.707 --> 45:12.068
He was gone by the time we got there.

45:12.103 --> 45:13.665
I know.

45:13.699 --> 45:16.660
So what are you gonna do now?

45:16.695 --> 45:19.522
I have a party to run...

45:19.556 --> 45:24.947
An election to fight.

45:24.982 --> 45:26.677
And you?

45:28.775 --> 45:31.171
I've got a promise to keep.

45:33.202 --> 45:34.897
Sir.

45:34.931 --> 45:36.493
Tango Team were heavily
engaged at Nostromo Base.

45:36.527 --> 45:39.288
They took multiple casualties.

45:39.322 --> 45:42.283
It's lucky we got out when we did.

45:42.317 --> 45:44.082
What about the device?

45:44.150 --> 45:45.545
Captured.

45:45.579 --> 45:47.208
Huh.

45:47.276 --> 45:48.774
No matter.

45:48.842 --> 45:51.038
It was worth the sacrifice.

45:51.072 --> 45:52.401
Well, now what?

45:54.866 --> 45:56.929
Now we make them pay.
