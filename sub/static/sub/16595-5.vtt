WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:04.937
(blender whirrs)

00:04.939 --> 00:07.206
Morning, everybody.
Oh.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.508
Green is not the color
for breakfast.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.678
Unless you're Dr. Seuss.
-(chuckles)

00:12.680 --> 00:14.113
Well,
will I drink it in a box?

00:14.115 --> 00:15.381
Will I drink it with a fox?

00:15.383 --> 00:17.249
How about you drink it
alone in the garage?

00:18.352 --> 00:20.853
Behind a shelf,
all by yourself.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.454
Dad, there's bacon and eggs
over here.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.623
Bacon and eggs --
I am in.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.893
-So, let's talk about our
Halloween party. -I'm out.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.829
Mike, for the last three years
you have said,

00:30.831 --> 00:33.165
"Let's not have a party.
We'll do it next year."

00:33.167 --> 00:34.967
Well, it sounds like
we have a good thing going.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.535
Let's do that.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.972
No, come on -- I-I'll even use
the fancy 2% raise

00:39.974 --> 00:42.408
the teachers' union just won
to pay for the party.

00:42.410 --> 00:46.178
Listen, I will give you
a 4% raise not to do it.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.081
Why? Dad, our Halloween parties
are always so much fun.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.150
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.886
Let's all recall
the party your mom had us

00:53.888 --> 00:55.487
dress up
as the Seven Dwarves.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.523
Well, listen,
I had to be Grumpy.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.725
It was the stupidest Halloween
ever.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.494
But I got to be Snow White,
because I look like this.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.263
And a bird
did land on my hand.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.565
You know,
maybe this is the year

01:06.567 --> 01:09.902
you finally go for my serial-killer theme.
That can be scary.

01:09.904 --> 01:12.271
Ah, you've been pitching
that idea since you were three.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.240
<i> That</i> is scary.
We're adults.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.109
I don't think we should do these
dress-up parties anymore.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.710
No, no --
You're not getting out of it.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.546
Look, just think of it as a --
as a family dinner

01:20.548 --> 01:22.281
where we're all
dressed up as...

01:22.283 --> 01:23.515
superheroes!

01:23.517 --> 01:25.517
-No.
-Superhero...no.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.386
Since you don't like
any of our ideas,

01:27.388 --> 01:29.221
why don't you
come up with one?

01:29.223 --> 01:31.390
Yeah, you're supposed to be
the marketing genius.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.058
You pitch something.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.793
All right, picture this --

01:34.795 --> 01:36.228
(intense voice)
A dark house --

01:36.230 --> 01:39.098
A single light
glows in the kitchen.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.800
A handsome man walks into the
kitchen, puts the light out.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.603
You hear a creaking of steps
as he goes upstairs,

01:44.605 --> 01:46.805
goes into his room,
lays down.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.307
When he wakes up...

01:48.309 --> 01:50.476
it's November!

01:50.478 --> 01:53.612
Oh, I get it.
I get it. I get it.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.247
He's all alone in the
house, because the family

01:56.273 --> 01:58.550
found a new daddy who
keeps his promises.

01:58.552 --> 02:01.453
We're having this party, Mike,
and you are planning it.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.322
(normal voice) Why do I
have to do everything.

02:03.324 --> 02:07.626
And what is
this new daddy gonna do?

02:15.669 --> 02:17.102
All right, Mikey,
come on...

02:17.104 --> 02:18.904
(knocks on door)
-...heading for lunch.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.106
(sighs) Now that Ed's let
the cat out of the bag,

02:21.108 --> 02:22.808
I guess you're invited.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.910
Listen, I'm racking my brain
trying to

02:24.912 --> 02:28.180
come up with a theme for
my family's Halloween party.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.015
-I got a fun one.
-I don't want a fun one.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.483
I want a bad one so bad

02:31.485 --> 02:33.919
they'll never do this
Halloween party again.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.155
You're an awful man.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.824
And yet people keep
inviting me to parties.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.994
I don't.
I don't even want you at lunch.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.929
I'm with you
on killing Halloween.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.531
You know what ruined it for me
last year?

02:45.533 --> 02:48.534
-Hey, guys!
-(clears throat) This jackass.

02:48.536 --> 02:52.004
Tell them about the costume
you wore on Halloween.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.306
-Oh, when I was you?
-Mm-hmm.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.409
(impersonating Ed) "I've never
been so insulted in my life."

02:58.879 --> 03:00.846
(normal voice)
That was hilarious.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.949
(impersonating Ed) "Now get the
hell back to work, Kyle."

03:03.951 --> 03:06.285
(normal voice) Okay!

03:07.221 --> 03:09.188
Little costume really got
under your skin, didn't it?

03:09.190 --> 03:11.190
Nobody likes
to be impersonated.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.625
It's why Rich Little
is despised.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.327
I don't know, Ed.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.529
They say imitation is
the sincerest form of flattery.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.898
Oh, why don't you show Mike
your impersonation of him then?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.868
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.037
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.838
This gives me an idea
for a great theme.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.142
My family wants a theme, I've
got the theme -- my family.

03:30.144 --> 03:33.312
They'll dress like each other,
act like each other,

03:33.314 --> 03:35.581
and if I play my cards right,

03:35.583 --> 03:38.250
they're gonna end up
hating each other.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.752
When I said
you were an awful man,

03:40.754 --> 03:45.357
did I say "The most awful"?
Because I meant the most awful.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.059
Just relax.
They'll stop hating each other

03:47.061 --> 03:48.594
once they take the costumes off,

03:48.596 --> 03:50.729
but they'll never stop
hating Halloween.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.065
Okay, okay.
Well, who is gonna be who?

03:53.067 --> 03:54.900
-Natural enemies.
-Hmm.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.102
Eve will Mandy,
Mandy will be Eve.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.004
Ryan and Kristin
will be each other.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.840
My, God. It's gonna be
a blood bath.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.875
Ryan and Kristin
aren't natural enemies.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.177
They're married.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.012
Fighting the urge
to tell our spouse

04:07.014 --> 04:08.513
what we really feel about them

04:08.515 --> 04:12.351
is what couples mistakenly call
"love."

04:12.353 --> 04:15.020
Baxter, that is...

04:15.022 --> 04:16.888
Okay, that's true.

04:16.890 --> 04:20.926
So, you're gonna be Vanessa
and Vanessa will be you?

04:20.928 --> 04:23.795
No. I can't be Vanessa.
She's too nice.

04:23.797 --> 04:27.032
Plus I --
I can't walk in heels.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.835
The trick is to keep the weight
on your toes.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.039
Come on.

04:34.041 --> 04:38.277
What I need for Vanessa is
somebody so nice it's annoying.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.213
I need...
-I brought you guys cupcakes.

04:41.215 --> 04:44.583
...this jackass.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.986
I'm not crazy about
the new nickname, guys.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.694
(as Kristin)
Hey, Mom!

04:59.566 --> 05:02.367
Ryan and I are here!

05:06.573 --> 05:09.508
(as Ryan) Hide the meat,
you barbarians.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.476
VANESSA: Be right there!

05:11.478 --> 05:13.078
(normal voice) Every time I look
at you, I start laughing.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.780
This is a great idea
your dad --

05:14.782 --> 05:16.481
(normal voice) I know, I know!
You look so great, too!

05:16.483 --> 05:20.185
I mean, you went a little
overboard with the breasts.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.653
It's like
no matter what I do,

05:21.655 --> 05:24.856
one always just seems
like it's smaller.

05:27.127 --> 05:30.295
(as Kristin) Oh, hey,
it's my little sister Eve!

05:30.297 --> 05:32.931
(as Eve)
Sure, lame, whatever.

05:32.933 --> 05:36.134
Grumble, grumble.
Complain.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.469
(normal voice)
Oh, my God!

05:37.471 --> 05:39.104
I say this
as a fashion designer --

05:39.106 --> 05:41.173
Ryan,
you are rocking that tunic.

05:41.175 --> 05:45.477
-The boobs are a little much.
-The boobs are a lot much.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.946
(as Eve) Mandy, come on!
You're always late!

05:47.948 --> 05:51.216
The party's starting --
grumble, grumble, complain.

05:51.218 --> 05:54.753
(as Mandy)
Here I am, everyone.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.560
You're welcome.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.995
You look so glamorous.

06:03.997 --> 06:07.232
I'm sorry, are there times
I don't look glamorous?

06:07.234 --> 06:09.701
(normal voice)
Why is one bigger?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.985
(as Kyle) Hey, everybody.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.320
Sorry I'm late.

06:28.322 --> 06:31.590
I stopped to talk
to a butterfly.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.092
Where's Dad?

06:34.094 --> 06:35.861
(normal voice)
Uh, I don't know.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.763
He's been working on his costume
in the garage all afternoon,

06:37.765 --> 06:39.064
I --
-Who's he gonna be?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.399
There's no one left
in the family.

06:40.401 --> 06:43.468
We're here to make Halloween
great again.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.916
I'll do it quickly.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.118
It'll be amazing.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.861
Uh,
I don't get it, Dad.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.696
We're all dressed like family,
and you're dressed like Trump?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.031
Mm.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.634
Trump is like family to me,
believe me.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.370
He's got my aunt's hair

07:18.372 --> 07:21.573
and my grandmother's
hatred of foreigners.

07:21.575 --> 07:26.645
(as Kyle) I love whatever you
say and agree with it, Mr. B.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.815
Thank you, Kyle.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.751
You must hate this costume,
huh?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.920
Uh, are you kidding me?
I love that costume.

07:34.922 --> 07:38.423
The guy single-handedly
destroyed his own party.

07:38.425 --> 07:42.260
Why would anyone
destroy their own party?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.962
You know,
I am so glad we did this.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.298
This is already so much fun.
-(chuckles)

07:46.300 --> 07:48.800
We're just getting started.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.969
(as Trump) Look at that --
Mandy Baxter, Mandy Baxter.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.571
How beautiful you are.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.172
You know, beauty is
the only thing that counts.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.974
(giggles) (as Mandy)
Thank you, Mr. Trump.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.309
I was in a bit of a hurry,

07:57.311 --> 07:58.677
so it only took me eight hours
to get ready.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.111
(laughs)

08:00.113 --> 08:01.980
(as Eve)
Well, I'm always ready.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.182
I put on this outfit
in the seventh grade,

08:04.184 --> 08:07.118
and I've never
changed out of it.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.687
(laughs)

08:08.689 --> 08:12.624
That's funny and mean --
my favorite kind of funny.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.594
I laugh when I put on makeup,
because clowns are funny.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.365
I never laugh.
It interferes with my moping.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.867
But let me try.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.768
Ha.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.171
Ha.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.939
No. Never mind. It burns.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.175
(laughs)

08:30.177 --> 08:32.811
Come on, Mr. B
and all the little Bs.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.513
(laughs)
Let's play a game

08:34.515 --> 08:38.850
where we're all super nice
and the winner is everybody.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.353
(as Kristin)
Yeah, I'm with Kyle.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.455
Let's all just have fun!

08:44.358 --> 08:46.124
(normal voice)
I'm surprised you're here, Ryan.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.559
I know
you don't like Halloween.

08:47.561 --> 08:48.960
(as Ryan) Oh, you know,
Halloween used to be

08:48.962 --> 08:50.695
a beautiful pagan holiday,

08:50.697 --> 08:54.566
till it was taken over
by Big Sugar.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.871
(normal voice) Big Sugar
is not a joke, Kristin.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.375
(as Kristin) But I guess
I would know that if I read

09:03.377 --> 09:06.645
any of the books my husband
brought home for me to read.

09:06.647 --> 09:10.015
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You're right.

09:10.017 --> 09:13.385
My wife should, like, you know,
work less and read more.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.021
Oh, but wait.
Then we'd starve.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.389
(normal voice)
All right, okay.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.157
Everybody, everybody --
hang on, hang on.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.259
This is Mom for a second.
Um, listen -- Let's --

09:21.261 --> 09:23.328
Let's not take any of this
personally, okay?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.830
(as Vanessa)
Where's my Chardonnay?

09:34.374 --> 09:38.743
Oh...my...God.

09:40.781 --> 09:44.449
How long do I have to whine
before I can get some wine?

09:45.886 --> 09:47.953
(normal voice)
Mrs. B makes a lot of puns,

09:47.955 --> 09:49.554
and they're really hard
to come up with,

09:49.556 --> 09:52.591
so I have some cards...

09:52.593 --> 09:55.293
to help me be a card.

09:56.763 --> 09:57.862
Wow.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.632
You never looked better,
Vanessa.

10:00.634 --> 10:05.704
He looks like the woman at the
hardware store who makes keys.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.773
Thanks, Mr. B.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.076
Mandy told me to wear
something called SPANX.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.812
I don't wear SPANX...

10:13.814 --> 10:15.647
that often.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.115
(normal voice)
Come on, Mom.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.950
Remember, we're not taking
any of this personally.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.118
MIKE:
(as Trump) That's right.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.620
Mandy Baxter, Mandy Baxter,

10:21.622 --> 10:23.388
I understand you're
a job creator like me.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.290
It must take
quite a bit of brains

10:25.292 --> 10:26.825
to have your own design company.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.727
(as Mandy) Mm. Nope.

10:30.597 --> 10:34.633
But I understand you're the CEO
of -- of a vast empire.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.636
Well, I make tube tops
in my parents' basement,

10:37.638 --> 10:40.572
so it's more of
a vest empire.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.807
(normal voice) Uh, yeah.
I make more than tube tops.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.109
(normal voice)
It was just a joke.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.978
(normal voice)
Hey, Evie, Evie, Evie...

10:46.980 --> 10:49.848
(as Trump) So, you like
the military. So do I.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.251
(as Eve) Yeah, my whole life
I waited to get into West Point,

10:53.253 --> 10:55.353
practically turned myself
into a guy,

10:55.355 --> 10:57.856
but, uh, they still
didn't want me,

10:57.858 --> 10:59.991
so now I write songs
for no money,

10:59.993 --> 11:02.694
which is exactly how much
they're worth.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.329
(normal voice)
Basement clown.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.031
(normal voice)
Guitar monkey.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.532
(normal voice) Oh, hey, look,
there's your next protest --

11:07.534 --> 11:10.835
Save the Guitar Monkeys.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.871
(normal voice) Why?
So you can kill them

11:12.873 --> 11:15.974
and serve them
in your restaurant?

11:15.976 --> 11:19.344
Everybody, come on!
Stop, stop. This is a party!

11:19.346 --> 11:21.112
(as Vanessa)
I'm enjoying this part-E.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.449
I can't wait for part-F.

11:27.688 --> 11:31.356
Shove it, Kyle.

11:31.358 --> 11:36.227
Ah, Halloween. It's a great,
great holiday, believe me.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.375
(as Vanessa) Hey, kids,
why don't we play --

11:50.377 --> 11:52.744
No!

11:52.746 --> 11:54.846
Ooh,
I can make my famous --

11:54.848 --> 11:57.015
No!

11:57.017 --> 11:58.717
(normal voice) Wow.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.853
Mrs. B,
people do not like you.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.555
MIKE:
(exhales sharply)

12:03.557 --> 12:05.223
That was fun.
That was great.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.725
I got a bunch of little
trick-or-treaters

12:06.727 --> 12:10.662
to start chanting
"Lock her up, lock her up."

12:10.664 --> 12:13.331
Ah...

12:13.333 --> 12:15.300
Got kind of choked up.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.370
So, what'd I miss?

12:19.372 --> 12:22.774
My wife made fun of
my interest in Buddhism.

12:22.776 --> 12:26.945
Religious bigotry --
always funny.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.913
Please ignore
that bearded woman.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.183
She's just cranky from lugging
around those enormous boobs.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.353
Huge.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.421
(doorbell rings)

12:36.423 --> 12:37.555
ALL: I'll get it.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.224
I'll get it! (sighs)

12:39.226 --> 12:40.625
It'd be nice to see some kids

12:40.627 --> 12:43.428
who are just pretending
to be monsters.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.598
Geez,
this party is so lame.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.301
And that's the real me.
I'm not even doing Eve.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.771
Can we please wrap this up?

12:52.773 --> 12:54.873
I'm having a good time.

12:54.875 --> 12:58.443
It's not like
I can control the party.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.278
(as Vanessa)
I'm enjoying this part-E.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.481
I can't wait for part--
-Kyle, you already did that one!

13:03.483 --> 13:06.117
Please! This has to end!

13:06.119 --> 13:07.952
All right.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.823
I'll go...
see if I can make a deal.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.291
(chuckles)

13:13.293 --> 13:16.060
(as Trump) You know,
there's an art to it.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.434
Hey. What's wrong
with everybody?

13:23.436 --> 13:24.936
Oh, Mike,
this is awful.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.671
All we have done
is insult each other.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.406
Yeah.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.441
I hate to say this, but maybe
we should just call it a night.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.777
(scoffs) You know -- You know
why I wanted this party?

13:32.779 --> 13:34.279
-Yeah.
-You know why?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.648
Because everybody in this family
was there for me

13:36.650 --> 13:38.316
when I was worried about
the teachers' strike.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.684
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, and I just --

13:39.686 --> 13:41.085
I just wanted to celebrate.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.520
But after tonight,

13:42.522 --> 13:44.322
I-I never want to have
a Halloween party again.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.757
You know
I hate to say this.

13:45.759 --> 13:49.327
But in some small way,
I blame myself.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.763
Honey,
it's not your fault.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.398
You didn't do it.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.003
I did it!! Yeah!

13:59.005 --> 14:00.839
(doorbell rings)

14:05.278 --> 14:06.544
Ahh!

14:20.827 --> 14:24.963
What is that?

14:24.965 --> 14:27.298
It's what I'm wearing
to the VFW party.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.466
What is that?

14:28.468 --> 14:31.069
Donald Trump.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.971
You can't be Donald Trump.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.139
Why,
because I'm black?

14:35.141 --> 14:37.141
No,
because you're not orange.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.979
Mine is ironic.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.848
Yours is a tribute.

14:43.850 --> 14:47.886
-Mine is a stroke of genius.
-Huh.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.320
I think I might have just

14:49.322 --> 14:51.589
killed the Baxter
Halloween party for good.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.359
Okay, listen, listen, listen --
I-I got some bad news.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.427
I just off the phone
with Carol.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.396
The school board
finally figured out

14:58.398 --> 15:00.431
how they're gonna pay
for the teachers' raises.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.699
Oh, no.
Don't tell me layoffs.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.201
Yeah, yeah.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.670
And since Vanessa was one of
the last hired...

15:05.672 --> 15:07.071
-Crap!
-Yeah.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.907
Carol's been trying to
call Vanessa.

15:08.909 --> 15:12.076
I-I don't know how you're gonna
tell her she's fired.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.885
I can't tell her
that she's fired

15:20.887 --> 15:23.121
on a night that the family is
going at each other's throats.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.790
So,
you wrecked your own party

15:25.792 --> 15:29.093
and still see yourself as the victim?
Well...

15:29.095 --> 15:31.429
You're right, you do make
a better Trump than me.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.373
MIKE:
Where's everybody going?

15:42.375 --> 15:43.608
KRISTIN:
Mom said the party's over,

15:43.610 --> 15:45.143
so I guess it's time
for Ryan and me

15:45.145 --> 15:47.912
to ride home
in stony silence.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.747
Yeah, and I've got to
get out of this makeup.

15:49.749 --> 15:50.949
I do not want to wake up

15:50.951 --> 15:52.650
with the Shroud of Turin
on my pillow.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.820
Nobody is going anywhere.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.323
(as Eve) Oh, you mean
like my music career.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.625
Hold on a minute.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.226
We got to reboot this party.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.162
I just found out
your mom lost her job.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.831
But being a teacher
means everything to Mom.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.132
This is gonna crush her.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.968
Well, not tonight it's not,
you know?

16:09.970 --> 16:12.103
We're gonna give her the holiday
party that she's always wanted,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.772
and I'll tell her
she's fired tomorrow.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.908
Wh-- I was fired?!

16:16.910 --> 16:18.443
Or I could tell her now.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.311
Oh.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.146
Chuck just came over. Carol's
been trying to call you, honey.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.149
I'm sorry.
-Oh... (groans)

16:27.620 --> 16:29.454
Well, this blows.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.289
Yeah, I feel really bad.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.024
(normal voice) We all should.
We acted pretty awful tonight.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.826
Yeah, Dad had this awesome idea
for a party

16:34.828 --> 16:38.363
and all we did was
rip into each other.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.365
Yeah,
about this awesome idea --

16:40.367 --> 16:42.100
You know, the truth is...

16:42.102 --> 16:43.534
I, uh...

16:43.536 --> 16:48.473
I forgive all of you,
you know?

16:48.475 --> 16:51.876
And maybe we all learned
something tonight, huh?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.179
What are you gonna say to her,
Dad?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.749
I don't know.
I'm just gonna be there for her.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.121
(as Vanessa) And that's why
I married that man.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.894
(door opens, closes)

17:11.564 --> 17:13.297
Hey. How you doing?

17:13.299 --> 17:16.067
(scoffs)
I feel like such a dope.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.971
Ah, that's just
the costume talking.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.575
Listen, you have every reason
to feel sad, okay?

17:24.577 --> 17:25.910
No, I am not sad.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.712
I am really, really mad.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.180
Well, that's good.
You should be mad.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.882
The school board -- That was
all wrong what they did.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.750
No, no, no --
I am not mad at them...

17:32.752 --> 17:35.686
although they suck!

17:35.688 --> 17:38.389
I'm mad at myself.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.224
-You didn't do anything here.
-I did. I did.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.060
-No, you didn't.
-No, I was this close

17:42.062 --> 17:44.328
to being the vice president
of an energy company,

17:44.330 --> 17:45.830
and I gave it all up

17:45.832 --> 17:48.666
because I had this stupid idea
to chase a dream.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.669
Hmm.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.372
Well, let's not talk about
the high-paying job you gave up

17:54.374 --> 17:56.774
and all the stuff we could have
bought with that capital.

17:56.776 --> 18:00.078
I think it's always a good idea
to chase your dreams.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.512
No,
of course you do, honey,

18:01.514 --> 18:03.381
because your dreams
always come true.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.450
You plan to make something
happen and it happens.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.018
Well, don't compare yourself
to me.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.953
You're already feeling
too bad about yourself.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.288
(scoffs)

18:10.290 --> 18:12.090
I just want
this night to be over.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.758
-No, no.
-This whole family party was,

18:13.760 --> 18:16.594
as Trump would say,
"A disaster."

18:18.431 --> 18:19.797
Guys, no, no.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.599
I'm not listening to
any more fighting tonight.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.267
Well, maybe they came out here
for another reason --

18:23.269 --> 18:24.602
right, right, right?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.571
Yeah, Mom.
We just came to help.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.706
Well, great.
Think you can go back in time

18:28.708 --> 18:30.541
and talk me out of
becoming a teacher?

18:30.543 --> 18:33.978
She's feeling upset
about chasing her dream.

18:33.980 --> 18:38.616
Mandy, do you think it was
a bad idea to chase your dream?

18:38.618 --> 18:42.487
Um...Eve was the one who asked
if she could help, but okay.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.989
Actually, I'm not talking
to Mandy-Eve.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.491
I'm talking to Eve-Mandy.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.293
(as Mandy) Oh,
you mean the fashion thing?

18:49.295 --> 18:50.828
No,
it wasn't a mistake.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.898
But a lot of people said
"You can't do that."

18:53.900 --> 18:56.434
Well, because I was so pretty,
people thought I wasn't smart.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.636
But I said "Screw them,"
because now my business

18:58.638 --> 19:00.238
is almost too big
for that basement

19:00.240 --> 19:02.340
because I am really smart.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.076
Even my little sister
thinks so.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.778
But she was making fun of you
all night long.

19:07.780 --> 19:11.949
(as Eve) Yeah, 'cause I don't
want people to think that I care.

19:11.951 --> 19:16.087
They'll think it's lame --
grumble, grumble, complain.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.956
Can I say something?

19:18.958 --> 19:21.359
No.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.794
Your mom's dealing with a --
a major disappointment.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.363
-(sighs)
-You can relate to that.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.332
Heck yeah. My whole life,
I wanted to go to West Point.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.700
It was my dream.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.003
And when I didn't get in,
it really hurt.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.105
But I didn't cry about it.

19:34.107 --> 19:37.141
(clicks tongue)
I'm not a baby. I'm a badass.

19:37.143 --> 19:40.511
But my big sister
cried about it,

19:40.513 --> 19:42.747
even though
she never told me.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.452
Well, I hate to cry, because
it ruins $40 worth of makeup.

19:48.454 --> 19:52.723
But now, I have this
whole new music thing,

19:52.725 --> 19:54.458
which I think
makes me pretty cool.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.660
(Mike chuckles)

19:55.662 --> 19:57.862
(normal voice)
And it sort of does.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.363
-Um, my turn.
-No!

19:59.365 --> 20:01.399
Dad.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.334
All right.

20:03.336 --> 20:07.004
Well, I'm sure
my wife will mock me for this,

20:07.006 --> 20:09.840
but I'd like to share
something the Dalai Lama said

20:09.842 --> 20:11.742
that I think speaks to
your situation.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.711
He said "Sometimes
not getting what you want

20:13.713 --> 20:15.546
can be a wonderful
stroke of luck."

20:15.548 --> 20:16.814
-Hmm.
-What?

20:16.816 --> 20:19.083
I read some of the books
you give me.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.986
I love you, you jerk.

20:21.988 --> 20:26.057
Look at that.
There's my family.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.759
Where have you guys been
all night?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.096
You know what?

20:32.098 --> 20:34.865
This turned out to be
the perfect party.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.468
(scoffs)
Well, of course. I planned it.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.740
And we are gonna have one
every year!

20:48.181 --> 20:51.349
You know, in a small way,
I blame myself.

20:58.725 --> 21:02.627
(as Vanessa)
Okay, listen up!

21:02.629 --> 21:06.030
I am a good teacher,
and I am not gonna go quietly.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.798
I say we grab a carton of eggs,

21:07.800 --> 21:08.933
head down to that school board,

21:08.935 --> 21:11.535
and "eggs-press ourselves."

21:13.473 --> 21:16.207
MANDY: Ah, sweetie,
don't be ridiculous.

21:16.209 --> 21:18.142
Yeah, Kyle.
Everything's fine now.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.580
I could
throw an egg or two.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.215
Don't do it.
Let me do it.

21:24.217 --> 21:28.019
I can get away with anything,
believe me.
