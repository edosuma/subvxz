I won a chain saw.

What?
What are you talking about?

00:43.285 --> 00:44.785
Some lady up the block
is giving away

00:44.879 --> 00:46.937
all of her husband's stuff
'cause he shot himself

00:46.997 --> 00:48.530
-in the face.
-Oh, my God!

00:48.591 --> 00:50.698
I've seen that lady.
He did the right thing.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.459
That's also how we got
this couch.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.053
Basically everything
in this house

00:54.204 --> 00:56.280
is Christmas suicide furniture.

00:56.340 --> 00:58.390
Donna, they had a bullhorn.

00:58.542 --> 01:01.285
I don't know why,
but they had a bullhorn.

01:01.345 --> 01:03.228
DONNA:
Cleveland, it's time for lunch.

01:03.421 --> 01:05.289
What do I want? Sammich!

01:15.301 --> 01:18.635
So, kids, Bonnie just told me
about the neatest thing.

01:18.695 --> 01:20.395
It's called a podcast.

01:20.456 --> 01:23.140
I guess it's like a-a radio show
on your phone.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.250
Have you heard of these?
Podcasts.

01:25.443 --> 01:27.586
Yeah, Mom,
we know what podcasts are.

01:27.737 --> 01:29.329
Huh. (chuckles)

01:29.423 --> 01:32.316
I guess these types of things
take a while to reach the moms.

01:32.376 --> 01:34.551
I'll have to let Bonnie know.

01:44.555 --> 01:46.087
(dialing)

01:46.190 --> 01:48.256

01:48.359 --> 01:50.216
BONNIE:
Wow, really?

01:50.319 --> 01:52.336
Mom, Stewie needs
his sausage cut

01:52.354 --> 01:53.612

01:53.805 --> 01:55.672
Here, let me get that
for you, buddy.

01:55.732 --> 01:57.699

There you go.
Eat up, little guy.

02:10.289 --> 02:13.023
Damn it, Peter.
You ruined Stewie's chair.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.691
(pager vibrates)

02:14.793 --> 02:17.553
And Bonnie wants to know
what all the noise is.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.976
-Amazing.
-Ooh.

02:24.127 --> 02:26.052
-Wow, it's Willem Dafoe!
-That's right.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.630
Since Willem Dafoe
has more bones in his face

02:28.649 --> 02:30.390
than most people have
in their entire body,

02:30.526 --> 02:32.985
he's perfect for carving,
'cause the angles are so sharp.

02:33.178 --> 02:34.211
It's beautiful, Peter.

02:34.271 --> 02:36.062
Yeah, I just love William Dafoe.

02:36.215 --> 02:37.639
It's not "William,"
it's "Willem."

02:37.700 --> 02:39.307
Yeah, that's what I said.
"William."

02:39.368 --> 02:41.142
He was in<i> Spider-Man</i>
with Kristin Dunst.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.553
<i> -Kirsten</i> Dunst.
-Right. Kirsten Dunce.

02:43.655 --> 02:46.390
-It's not "Dunce," it's "Dunst."
-Yeah, Kristin Dunce.

02:46.491 --> 02:48.725
In the movie,
she dated William Dafoe's son.

02:48.744 --> 02:51.745
Spell it, Joe! Spell
what you are saying right now.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.063
Well, I'll give it a shot.

02:53.123 --> 02:57.401
K-Y- R-H...

02:58.703 --> 03:01.087
Look, there's a reason I became
a cop and not a spellman.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.923
-A what?
-A spellman.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.242
-"Spellman" is not a thing, Joe!
-Sure it is.

03:05.260 --> 03:07.427
Fireman, longshoreman, spellman.

03:07.579 --> 03:09.246
Stop me when I'm wrong.

03:09.264 --> 03:11.356
-He's getting too many right.
-Now I'm starting to think

03:11.549 --> 03:12.858
there<i> is</i> such a thing
as a spellman.

03:13.009 --> 03:14.100
PETER:
Hey, guys. Check it out.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.086
-It's Groot.
-Oh, yeah.

03:16.146 --> 03:19.156
-From that Marble movie.
-(sighs)

03:23.095 --> 03:24.519
What are you doing?!

03:24.580 --> 03:27.522
-Turn that chain saw off!
-Not a chance, Lois.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.691
You know how hard it was
to get that thing started?

03:29.710 --> 03:33.420
It was even worse than trying to
cover anything with Saran Wrap.

05:40.323 --> 05:41.915
-Awesome!
-I know, right?

05:42.067 --> 05:43.508
Gonna get us a lifetime supply

-It's even worse than that.

on its parents and killed them.

-Which one with the neck tattoo?

synthetic opioid do you need?

You know, sometimes joint pain

Have you ever had
a chiropractic adjustment?

09:25.123 --> 09:26.456
-What's that?
-It's a procedure

where a guy who couldn't
get into medical school

09:28.518 --> 09:30.476
-tries to rip your head off.
-Does it work?

09:30.629 --> 09:31.811

-Okay, I'll give it a shot.

Mr. Griffin,

10:05.939 --> 10:07.254
<i> Pet Sedentary?</i>

10:07.357 --> 10:09.107

to strengthen your core

and exercise regularly.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.570
-Is that the hat?
-Stupid, right?

10:16.675 --> 10:18.783
I know the holidays
are still months away,

10:25.851 --> 10:27.183
You know what, Chris?

10:27.243 --> 10:29.869
I feel like I'm ready
to start trying...

10:29.963 --> 10:32.738
to find another squirrel.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.857
What?

10:33.958 --> 10:36.192
Nothing. I just...

10:36.252 --> 10:39.028
I just hit the lottery
when I met you.

10:39.047 --> 10:40.363
Here's your photo.

10:40.423 --> 10:41.789
It's the only one
where the squirrel

wasn't trying
to bite your hand.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.717
-(chuckles): Ooh!
-Oh, I love it!

10:44.811 --> 10:47.203
-How much do we owe you?
-It's fine. Just keep it.

Whoa! Peter, what happened?

10:56.106 --> 10:58.047
Did you tease that witch again?

10:58.066 --> 10:59.399
No, I got a back adjustment.

10:59.551 --> 11:01.217
Turns out
I've been this tall all along.

11:01.277 --> 11:03.386
-You don't say.
-Well, that's amazing.

11:03.405 --> 11:04.979
Why are you still wearing
the same pants?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.724
I don't know. I only get
pants at Christmas, so...

11:07.742 --> 11:09.225
I'll get pants at Christmas.

11:09.285 --> 11:11.986
-So, how is it being that tall?
-It's okay, I guess.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.989
Although I've noticed I'm a lot
more clumsy in the bedroom.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.824
(bed creaking)

11:16.927 --> 11:17.917

11:43.595 --> 11:45.853
That's going on Instagram
right now.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.206
Totally! But we should
pair it with a song

11:48.399 --> 11:50.116
about steps or walking.

Oh, my God, yes.
"Walking on Sunshine."

Sell what?
That we're totally cliché?

11:56.407 --> 11:59.200
-How about "Step by Step"?
-New Kids on the Block?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.885
No. The Eddie Rabbitt version.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.703
And have people think we're 100?

12:02.764 --> 12:03.963
Let's do "Walking in Memphis."

12:04.115 --> 12:05.706
I will concede
that's a good song,

12:05.767 --> 12:08.468

so I find it confusing.

"Walk Like an Egyptian"?

Well, we don't live
