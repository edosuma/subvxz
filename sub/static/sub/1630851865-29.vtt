09:17.199 --> 09:19.680
is still not at the starting line,

09:20.040 --> 09:23.360
but the big race
for 'The Ice Cup' must begin.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.880
Ready,

09:25.000 --> 09:25.959
steady,

09:26.199 --> 09:27.040
skate!

09:27.360 --> 09:28.959
Woo! Woo! Go, go, go!

09:30.319 --> 09:31.480
[rope]

09:32.560 --> 09:34.040
Inuk! Inuk! Yay!

09:36.959 --> 09:37.839
Go, Inuk!

09:38.040 --> 09:39.160
Go, Inuk!

09:47.800 --> 09:48.880
Yes!

09:49.839 --> 09:51.880
Woo! Bravo! Yay!

09:53.079 --> 09:55.439
[shivering]
Congratulations, Inuk!

09:55.600 --> 09:57.240
[stutters]
Way to go!

09:57.400 --> 09:58.400
You cold, Ollie?

09:58.560 --> 10:00.160
Come with me to my igloo!

10:00.280 --> 10:02.439
I'm not sure how that's going to help.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.439
Argh! It's warmer in here than out there.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.240
Sure! That's what igloos are for!

10:11.360 --> 10:12.199
Keeping warm.

10:12.319 --> 10:13.199
Hot chocolate?

10:13.520 --> 10:14.600
Oh yes! Thank you!

10:14.760 --> 10:15.800
Thanks, Inuk!

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
You know, with a hot chocolate,
it's not too cold in here.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.199
And without one, it's not too hot.

10:21.319 --> 10:24.240
Finally!
A place where you can both be happy!

10:24.400 --> 10:25.839
[laughter]

10:30.000 --> 10:31.520
Hey, toes!

10:31.800 --> 10:35.240
Genius idea to bring
some igloo ice home, Ollie.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.480
How you doing, Moon?

10:36.640 --> 10:38.160
Would you like another cold drink?

10:38.319 --> 10:40.520
Are you comfortable
with your ice and fan?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.920
Very.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.160
Thanks for helping me
feel comfortable in the heat.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.199
You're welcome, Moon.

10:46.319 --> 10:47.640
We may like different weather,

10:47.760 --> 10:50.439
but that'll never stop us
from having fun together!

10:50.560 --> 10:51.480
Right, Stanley?

10:51.959 --> 10:53.199
You said it, Ollie.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.719
[All]
Ah... What a great day!

10:57.120 --> 10:59.400
[bird chirps]

11:00.120 --> 11:06.400
[End music]
