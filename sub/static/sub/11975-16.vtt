love to, but, because of Chyna,
I'm not coming."

00:13.967 --> 00:15.467
You talk to Khloe
lately?

00:15.467 --> 00:16.967
- No.
- She's had a hard year.

00:16.967 --> 00:21.233
- And she misses her brother.-

00:21.233 --> 00:25.367
- way!
- I was just checking to

could see you soon.

Yeah.
In two years you'll be 39.

You got to strip
club it up when you're in Vegas.

01:05.967 --> 01:07.900
- Yeah.
- We went to one one

01:07.900 --> 01:12.567
time, and Khloe was hanging the
strippers upside down by their

01:12.567 --> 01:16.167
- ankles, holding them like this.
- There's no way.

01:16.167 --> 01:19.067
And then Malika,
the strippers had Malika by her

01:19.067 --> 01:22.933
ankles and were shaking her.
Like, upside down.

01:22.933 --> 01:25.633

in the corner.

What do you want to do for your

01:58.133 --> 01:59.967
- birthday?
- Well, I'm not doing

01:59.967 --> 02:01.633
- anything, I never do anything.
- Yeah, you do.

02:01.633 --> 02:03.567
What have I done for
my birthday for the past two

02:03.567 --> 02:04.800
years?
Just answer the question.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.400
I'm trying to think.
25 you were fat, so you probably

02:07.400 --> 02:08.900
just tried to eat yourself.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.233
Uh, 26 you were
slimming down.

02:11.233 --> 02:14.033
One year, Kourtney
threw a pajama party for me at

02:14.033 --> 02:15.700
- her house.
- What year was this?

02:15.700 --> 02:18.067
It was the year that I
thought I was turning an age,

02:18.067 --> 02:21.600
but I guess I missed a year, so
that year was not a good one for

02:21.600 --> 02:22.733
me.

02:22.733 --> 02:24.167
And I had a balloon.
One balloon.

We can make it so
poppin'.

del Rey, and you sail to Malibu?

birthday for people who enjoy

02:33.900 --> 02:35.833
- water.
- Ooh, right.

02:35.833 --> 02:37.600
I absolutely hate
water.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.900
She needs a flotation
device.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.567
I'm gonna look up penis
flotation devices.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.433
Do you want to,
like, bowl?

02:42.433 --> 02:44.200
- Roller skating?
- Are you kidding?

02:44.200 --> 02:47.633
I would kill myself.
I love everybody else's

02:47.633 --> 02:50.167
birthdays, I don't love my own
birthday.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.767
Really just because there's been
plenty of years where my

02:52.767 --> 02:56.867
birthday just has been, kind of,
like, dark clouds around it.

02:56.867 --> 03:00.167
So I'd rather do nothing and
have no expectations.

03:00.167 --> 03:02.300
How old are you
turning?

03:02.300 --> 03:03.633
- 20?
- I'm only kidding, I

03:03.633 --> 03:06.433
know you don't talk about age
anymore, it's just... where you

03:06.433 --> 03:08.467
- are in your body.
Mm-hmm.

03:08.467 --> 03:11.233
I like that.
In my eyes, you're about 25.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.433
Why are you so
nervous about your-- wait, you

03:13.433 --> 03:16.267
already turned 30.
Are you turning 31 or are you

03:16.267 --> 03:18.333
- turning 30?
- First of all, listen.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.433
- I'm not afraid of my age.
- Looking your age up

03:21.433 --> 03:23.500
- right now.
- That's not fair!

03:23.500 --> 03:26.767
No, I wouldn't Google you.

Here, let me tell you,
you are in your prime now.

I have to do a London trip, and
I have to present at an awards

04:27.700 --> 04:30.700
show, which I'm used to doing
with Kim and Khloe.

Like, I love doing everything
all together, but I just feel

04:33.967 --> 04:37.167
like, to do interviews by
myself, like, to have a meet and

04:37.167 --> 04:39.100
greet, I'm like, "Does anybody
really care?"

04:39.100 --> 04:41.400
- Like...
- What?

04:41.400 --> 04:44.933
Speaking in public
by myself is, like, a huge no

04:44.933 --> 04:48.167

I failed two classes in college

04:48.167 --> 04:50.367

speech.

Like, doing anything with my
sisters, I'm totally fine, and

04:53.133 --> 04:55.667
we're all together.
But just, like, knowing that

04:55.667 --> 04:58.133
it's all about me, I just don't
like being the center of

04:58.133 --> 05:00.233
- attention.
- People care.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.600
This-- you guys are-- you're so
insecure, what's wrong with you?

- But, seriously, if

05:09.767 --> 05:11.567

nasty.

talked, it was a nice
conversation.

- you felt good, right?
- Yeah, like, I-I was

06:04.933 --> 06:07.033
just hon-- like, I just told
him, I was like, you know, like,

06:07.033 --> 06:09.467
"When I married Lamar, like, it
was really awkward and I had to

06:09.467 --> 06:12.633
put myself and, like, make
myself uncomfortable so the

06:12.633 --> 06:15.267
family was comfortable."
It was my job to bring Lamar in

06:15.267 --> 06:17.033
and make everyone fall in love
with him.

06:17.033 --> 06:19.067
- It's still his job...
- Totally!

06:19.067 --> 06:20.633
...to bring her
around, and that's what I was

06:20.633 --> 06:22.533
- saying.
- Are you aware of what

06:22.533 --> 06:24.933
- happened over the weekend?
- No, what happened over

06:24.933 --> 06:26.433
- the weekend?
- Are you serious?

06:26.433 --> 06:27.567
What happened over
the weekend?

06:27.567 --> 06:29.133
Yeah, what happened
over the weekend? Why would I

06:29.133 --> 06:30.567
- say...
- I guess they got into,

06:30.567 --> 06:32.200
- like, a really big fight.
- I've heard they've

06:32.200 --> 06:35.300
been having problems recently.
And I'm sure he's stressed out

06:35.300 --> 06:37.233
enough with just everything
else.

06:37.233 --> 06:41.333
I know from firsthand
how difficult it was growing up

06:41.333 --> 06:44.300
overnight, you know what I mean?
Like, he's had a pretty easy

06:44.300 --> 06:47.733
life and now he technically has
to take care of a woman and a

06:47.733 --> 06:50.933
new child, and a step-child
basically, and it's like...

06:50.933 --> 06:52.933
I mean, I would think that's a
lot of pressure, but...

06:52.933 --> 06:54.867
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

06:54.867 --> 06:56.333
What was their fight
about?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.400
Oh, I mean, I think
it's something maybe you should

06:58.400 --> 07:00.333
ask him.
It seems pretty personal.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.967
I mean, I don't mind
calling him and saying

07:01.967 --> 07:05.500
something.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.200
- Hey, Rob.
- What's up?

07:07.200 --> 07:10.033
What's going on?
How's Chyna?

07:10.033 --> 07:13.433
Um...
I'm out of her house and we're

07:13.433 --> 07:16.333
- not living together.
- Why?

07:16.333 --> 07:18.400
I, honestly, I'm so over
it.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.500
If I don't care, then that's-
that's exactly where she wants

07:21.500 --> 07:23.933
me to be, and I'm completely
content with that.

07:23.933 --> 07:26.133
- And I'm just preparing myself.
- Well, you feel

07:26.133 --> 07:29.300
unappreciated, and, like, I
don't think she realizes maybe

07:29.300 --> 07:31.800
the effect it has on you, but
you also can't put all that

07:31.800 --> 07:35.800
on-on her shoulders, you know?
You've got to do your own thing,

07:35.800 --> 07:38.300
you've got to be strong on your
own two feet.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.833
And you got to, like, do you for
you, so no matter what, you'll

07:42.833 --> 07:45.300
- always be okay.
- I'm not doing nothing

07:45.300 --> 07:46.600
- wrong...
- But, like, you...

07:46.600 --> 07:48.467
I'm doing exactly what
she wants.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.400
So, I don't know what I need to
do.

07:50.400 --> 07:55.567
It's just a lot of this.
I don't know, I just don't...

07:55.567 --> 08:00.800
Hello?
I love that my brother has been

08:00.800 --> 08:06.100
so happy, and out and about, and
living his life, but hearing how

08:06.100 --> 08:08.667
upset he is, I am really
concerned that Rob will go

08:08.667 --> 08:10.600
backwards.
I don't want him to have made

08:10.600 --> 08:13.200
all this progress, and then, if
they're arguing, or something

08:13.200 --> 08:15.833
bad happens, he's gonna go and
retreat.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.533
- What are they doing?
- He said that he's

08:17.533 --> 08:19.533
giving her space.
He doesn't know how to act.

08:19.533 --> 08:23.100
You know, she's hormonal.
It's a new relationship where

08:23.100 --> 08:25.267
it's still weird anyway.

08:25.267 --> 08:29.900
- That's just a lot.
- So, how'd you get

08:29.900 --> 08:31.333
- involved with Manuka honey?
- They were looking

08:31.333 --> 08:33.267
- for a brand ambassador...
- Boring, boring,

08:33.267 --> 08:34.733
- that's so boring.
- What do you want me

08:34.733 --> 08:36.400
- to say?
- I want to buy it!

08:36.400 --> 08:41.200
Jonathan is making
me feel so much more anxious.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.433
Trying to find Rob.
Called him, texted him...

08:44.433 --> 08:46.533
- He was at his house.
- Oh, so he's not at

08:46.533 --> 08:48.367
Chyna's house.
They're still not talking to

08:48.367 --> 08:49.733
- each other?
Hm-mm.

08:49.733 --> 08:51.167
The more they're
fighting and the more depressed

08:51.167 --> 08:53.167
he gets, he'll go into hiding
again, go missing.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.133
I don't want Rob to live that
life anymore.

08:55.133 --> 09:01.200
How long is that gonna go on
for?

09:06.700 --> 09:12.100
- You comfy?
Mm-hmm.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.800

09:13.800 --> 09:15.567

you eat.

retirement, we need to go over

- your questions.
- Okay, so what

09:35.367 --> 09:37.000
- questions?
- I'm gonna throw you

09:37.000 --> 09:38.333
- off...
- Okay.

09:38.333 --> 09:41.133
...left and right.
So just remember, you're gonna

09:41.133 --> 09:43.733
be on your own, no sisters...
'Cause I swear, I used to do

"What should I say?"

09:47.800 --> 09:49.600
I'm like, "Let's go over this."

09:49.600 --> 09:51.100
Like, literally.
All right, Kourt.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.600
- Yeah.
- So how'd you get

09:52.600 --> 09:54.733
- involved with Manuka Honey?
- Well, I posted it

09:54.733 --> 09:56.633
- on my app...
Mm-hmm.

09:56.633 --> 09:58.633
...and they were
looking for a brand ambassador

09:58.633 --> 10:00.167
- for their skincare...
- Boring, boring,

10:00.167 --> 10:01.733
- that's so boring.
- What do you want me

10:01.733 --> 10:03.133
- to say?
- I want to buy it.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.200
Make it more exciting.
Be like, "I've loved honey my

10:05.200 --> 10:06.867
whole life and I was, like,
putting it on my..."

10:06.867 --> 10:08.400
"I put it on my..."

10:08.400 --> 10:09.767
- Yeah.
- "...to make it shine

10:09.767 --> 10:11.100
like the top of the Chrysler
Building!

10:11.100 --> 10:13.433
I want my nips to be a little
hard, you put it on..."

10:13.433 --> 10:15.600
Can you just
demonstrate where you put it?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.200
- Because people love visual.
- This is a skincare

10:17.200 --> 10:18.567
- line.
- Yeah. People love

10:18.567 --> 10:20.067
visual.
It's honey; honey's freaky.

10:20.067 --> 10:21.867
- It's for your face.
- Oh, it's not for

10:21.867 --> 10:23.800
- your body?
- No, but...

10:23.800 --> 10:25.567
At all?
Can you use it on your body?

10:25.567 --> 10:27.200
I was putting the
honey on my body.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.000
And?
What's it like?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.167
- You know.
- Don't smile.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.667
- Give a good answer.
- I was thinking of a

10:34.667 --> 10:37.167
real answer.
It's just, like, a really good

10:37.167 --> 10:39.767
- consistency.
- You have to answer

10:39.767 --> 10:42.900
- in a really full answer.
- This pretend

10:42.900 --> 10:46.400
interview was supposed to make
me feel so much better and more

10:46.400 --> 10:50.567
prepared, but Jonathan is making
me feel so much worse and so

10:50.567 --> 10:53.967
- much more anxious about it.
- Right now, you need

10:53.967 --> 10:57.600
some work.
Poosh, how did Momma do on the

10:57.600 --> 10:59.833
interview?
One to ten, give me a number.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.400
- No.
- No?

11:01.400 --> 11:02.933
Everything is "no,"
by the way. Nothing.

11:02.933 --> 11:04.467
- Really, P?
- No.

11:04.467 --> 11:07.133
"No."

11:19.167 --> 11:20.967
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:20.967 --> 11:23.667
How are you, honey?
You look really cute.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.833
- Thanks.
- Have you eaten today?

11:26.833 --> 11:30.533
Why, every time...
I could say, like, "Oh, my God,

11:30.533 --> 11:33.033
my nail broke," and you'd say,
"Have you eaten today?"

11:33.033 --> 11:36.033
This is crazy.
I just had an acai bowl.

11:36.033 --> 11:37.967
Strawberries are really bad
right now; are they out of

11:37.967 --> 11:39.933
- season?
- I don't know.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.300
Siri, where are you?
Hey, Siri.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.967
Come on, Siri.
Siri.

11:45.967 --> 11:47.233
Mom...

11:47.233 --> 11:48.400
Hey,
there.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.033
Oh. What is the best
season for strawberries?

11:52.033 --> 11:54.233
Hmm.
Here is what I found on the Web

11:54.233 --> 11:56.433
for "what is the best season for
strawberries?"

11:56.433 --> 11:58.167
Can you read it to me,
Siri?

11:58.167 --> 12:01.167
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

12:01.167 --> 12:04.067
- Who, me?
- Okay.

12:04.067 --> 12:06.133
So what are we gonna do for
Khloe's birthday?

12:06.133 --> 12:10.700
- Hello?
- That's a really good

12:10.700 --> 12:12.833
question, since we have, like,
no time left.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.867
She was saying how
she doesn't want to do anything.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.700
But I feel...
She needs to do something.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.467
- She never does anything.
- Okay.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.000
I had a million
suggestions; she wasn't into any

12:21.000 --> 12:23.167
of them.
She was into nothing.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.700
So I say we just do something
without telling her.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.267
- Or, like...
- Hi.

12:27.267 --> 12:29.600
- How are you?
- What up, girl?

12:29.600 --> 12:33.300
- What up?
- What's shakin'?

12:33.300 --> 12:34.600
We're talking about,
um...

12:34.600 --> 12:36.067
We're just talking
about Khloe's birthday.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.467
I think we should put
an ice skating rink over her

12:37.467 --> 12:39.433
- pool.
- But it's summer.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.100
What about a foam
party?

12:41.100 --> 12:43.300
- Yes...
- At her house, the

12:43.300 --> 12:46.167
pool, the whole thing's foam, we
do a Jell-O pit, Jell-O

12:46.167 --> 12:48.033
- fighting...
- Like everybody's gonna

12:48.033 --> 12:50.433
- do Jell-O shots?
- No!

12:50.433 --> 12:53.200
You're gonna  wrestle in
Jell-O.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.067
Is that not the vibe we're going
for?

12:55.067 --> 12:56.533
- I don't think so.
- No. I think...

12:56.533 --> 12:57.900
- I'm thinking more...
- Or maybe I hang out

12:57.900 --> 12:59.233
- with different people.
- ...party under the

12:59.233 --> 13:02.833
stars, dance floor, appetizers,
have a sushi bar...

13:02.833 --> 13:05.233
I mean, I think that
sounds pretty fun.

13:05.233 --> 13:10.033
Khloe is so loving and
has such a big heart, and she's

13:10.033 --> 13:14.067
so good at making sure that
everyone else feels special and

13:14.067 --> 13:16.867
loved.
So I think it's really important

13:16.867 --> 13:20.333
this year to come together and
start celebrating Khloe.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.433
Because she has had a tough
year.

13:22.433 --> 13:23.967
Should we get some
male strippers for her?

13:23.967 --> 13:25.767
- Yes!
- I think so.

13:25.767 --> 13:27.733
Oh, my God...
All right, well, I'm gonna...

13:27.733 --> 13:29.333
You like that?
I'll make that call.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.800
- I'll make that happen right now.
- Yeah, do that.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.500
- I'm going to...
- Wow.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.000
I am not so into those glasses.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.267
- Why?
- Very Harry Potter-ish.

13:37.267 --> 13:39.700
- Yeah. I like 'em.
- I don't love them.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.567
I think you're better than that.

13:51.567 --> 13:53.967
Are you wearing
full-blown underwear?

13:53.967 --> 13:55.700
Yeah, I have my
period.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.900
Like, granny panties?
Why are you wearing those 'cause

13:57.900 --> 14:00.433
- you have your period?
- 'Cause.

14:00.433 --> 14:02.167
What do you wear on
your period?

14:02.167 --> 14:03.800
- What do you mean?
- Like, what...

14:03.800 --> 14:05.767
I don't wear
tampons.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.400
- What?
- I just don't think

14:07.400 --> 14:09.467
- that's healthy.
- Hold on, let me...

14:09.467 --> 14:11.100
Look at me.
Let me see your... no, other

14:11.100 --> 14:13.133
way.
You're wearing a pad?

14:13.133 --> 14:14.500
- Yeah.
- How do you not look

14:14.500 --> 14:16.333
- like you have, like, a whole...
- Well, it's not,

14:16.333 --> 14:17.867
like, this thick.
I just

14:17.867 --> 14:19.233
- don't...
- The one... you

14:19.233 --> 14:20.900
should've seen the one in
Iceland.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.767
- It was this long...
- Ew!

14:22.767 --> 14:24.200
...and it was this
thick.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.733
And it had two sets of wings.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.833
- Two sets.
- For how big of a

14:28.833 --> 14:30.567
vagina?
I have

14:30.567 --> 14:32.467
- no idea.
- That is the most

14:32.467 --> 14:34.867
- disgusting thing.
- I have, like,

14:34.867 --> 14:37.633
- thin... thin ones.
- How we feeling?

14:37.633 --> 14:40.300
- Good.
- Okay, let's warm up.

14:40.300 --> 14:45.700
Let's just go up and down.
Just take off, grab 'em.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.267
- One.
- Are you feeling any

14:47.267 --> 14:49.433
- better about your press tour?
- No, I'm still kind

14:49.433 --> 14:51.400
- of nervous without you guys.
- Two.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.167
You act like you've
never done an interview.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.533
- I know.
- Three.

14:55.533 --> 14:57.900
Don't you get
nervous, when you did, like,

14:57.900 --> 15:01.233
- Howard Stern and all that stuff?
- Howard Stern is crazy.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.367
- I was so nervous.
- Four.

15:03.367 --> 15:05.233
Any  story our
family has, they're gonna ask.

15:05.233 --> 15:07.467
But you're doing more business.
Howard Stern, that's more

15:07.467 --> 15:09.167
- personal-oriented.
- Yeah, I mean, I'm

15:09.167 --> 15:10.933
not doing any crazy stuff like
that.

15:10.933 --> 15:12.333
- Five.
- It's all

15:12.333 --> 15:13.833
- beauty-related.
- The great thing is,

15:13.833 --> 15:15.533
you control your interviews and
you could then throw a question

15:15.533 --> 15:17.667
back at them.
Everything is about you.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.600
Yeah.
Khloe's right.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.700
Like, I am in control and I
don't have to say anything I

15:21.700 --> 15:24.533
don't want to say.
She's giving me much more

15:24.533 --> 15:28.267
helpful advice than Jonathan.
I have done this for so many

15:28.267 --> 15:30.933
years.
I just don't know why I get so

15:30.933 --> 15:32.867
- nervous.
- What are you nervous

15:32.867 --> 15:34.400
about?
Like, what questions is someone

15:34.400 --> 15:36.267
- gonna ask you?
- I don't know.

15:36.267 --> 15:37.633
I guess Scott
questions.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.300
No, I actually
don't care about Scott

15:39.300 --> 15:41.233
questions.
I can answer any Scott question

15:41.233 --> 15:44.067
easily.

15:44.067 --> 15:45.800
- I don't care about that.
- Do I kind of have a

15:45.800 --> 15:48.033
muscle if I do this?
No?

15:48.033 --> 15:50.833
Okay.
Can't hold it that much longer.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.433
Oh, hey.
Isn't this, like, your ideal

16:03.433 --> 16:06.600
weather?
You love it hot.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.467
I feel like I've seen this
before, but I can't figure it

16:08.467 --> 16:10.700
- out, so I'm trying to...
- It's just this that

16:10.700 --> 16:12.367
- you've seen before.
- I know.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.067
- I love that cape, though.
- It's Kendall's.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.367
Ooh.
Can I have it next?

16:16.367 --> 16:18.467
Yep.
I did shorten it, 'cause it was

16:18.467 --> 16:20.233
- so long.
- That's so mean.

16:20.233 --> 16:22.033
And she doesn't know
that, but I only tucked it.

16:22.033 --> 16:24.500
- So you can untuck.
- Mom loaned me this

16:24.500 --> 16:27.367
Valentino dress that I wore at
your wedding...

16:27.367 --> 16:28.867
Mm-hmm.
- ...and I tailored the

16:28.867 --> 16:30.567
whole thing, like, sucked it to
me, and I never told Mom 'cause

16:30.567 --> 16:32.467
I was scared.
And then she asked for it back

16:32.467 --> 16:34.500
and she was like, "It can't fit
me, I've gained so much weight,"

16:34.500 --> 16:36.233
but I was scared to tell her
that I really tailored...

16:36.233 --> 16:37.667
Oh, my God, you have to
confess today.

16:37.667 --> 16:41.900
No, it's okay.
Oh, my.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.067
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

16:44.067 --> 16:45.967
- South of France.
- Oh.

16:45.967 --> 16:48.067
- This is like...
- I haven't seen you.

16:48.067 --> 16:51.367
- ...an Italian getup.
- My Italian getup?

16:51.367 --> 16:54.567
It seems
very Italian.

16:54.567 --> 16:57.867
Wait, can we discuss... your
glasses are a little crooked.

16:57.867 --> 17:00.267
Oh.

17:00.267 --> 17:03.433
- How about that?
- So, trying to find

17:03.433 --> 17:06.067
Rob.
I've called him, I've texted

17:06.067 --> 17:09.100
- him, he's not responding.
- But he responded to

17:09.100 --> 17:11.500
Victory today.
He told Victory he was at his

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
- house.
- Oh, so he's not at

17:13.500 --> 17:15.667
- Chyna's house.
Uh-uh.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.567
They're still not
talking to each other?

17:17.567 --> 17:19.567
Uh-uh.
- How long is that gonna

17:19.567 --> 17:21.600
- go on for?
- I don't know.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.833
But I talked to Chyna and it
scared me because it was

17:24.833 --> 17:27.367
everything that we had
experienced with him, she was

17:27.367 --> 17:31.233
experiencing the same thing.
So she wrote me last night and

17:31.233 --> 17:33.467
she said, "Can I see you
tomorrow?

17:33.467 --> 17:35.767
I just really need to talk to
you."

17:35.767 --> 17:37.167
- And that's today?
- You know, "Rob won't

17:37.167 --> 17:38.933
talk to me..."
Yeah, she was supposed to come

17:38.933 --> 17:40.633
- over at 9:30.
- Rob won't talk to her?

17:40.633 --> 17:42.067
- Yeah.
- Why won't Rob talk to

17:42.067 --> 17:43.633
- her?
- I don't know, I haven't

17:43.633 --> 17:45.767
gotten into the whole song and
dance.

17:45.767 --> 17:48.400
Is he ever gonna see his
kid, though, or is s-she gonna

17:48.400 --> 17:50.400
- take it?
- You don't-- you really

17:50.400 --> 17:52.733
think they're over?
He seems-- like, when I talked

17:52.733 --> 17:55.600
to him, he was very much, like,
in love with her.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.467
Am I missing something?
How long have they not been

17:57.467 --> 18:00.433
- speaking for?
- I don't know.

18:00.433 --> 18:03.667
I know when my
brother hurts, how badly he does

18:03.667 --> 18:05.067
hurt.
The more they're fighting and

18:05.067 --> 18:08.433
the longer things are bothering
him, the more depressed he gets.

18:08.433 --> 18:10.233
He'll go into hiding again, go
missing.

18:10.233 --> 18:16.167
Like, I don't want Rob to live
that life anymore.

18:16.167 --> 18:20.100
I am super excited for

18:20.100 --> 18:25.500
my birthday party.♪ ♪

18:29.833 --> 18:33.300
- Go, go, go.
- Rob has been sleeping

18:33.300 --> 18:36.133
all day until 3:00 again, and
he's not motivated.

18:36.133 --> 18:38.767
I said, "You know, you have some
issues that you've always had.

18:38.767 --> 18:41.633
And all relationships fight, so
you have to deal with your

18:41.633 --> 18:49.200
issues, like...
Now, it's, like, reality time."

18:55.467 --> 18:57.867
- Khloe?
- Hi, Mom.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.500
Hey, what are you doing
out here?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.733
Sitting, it's so sunny
in here.

19:01.733 --> 19:04.667
It is sunny in here.
I love this ping-pong table.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.900
- Thank you.
- Like, this is really

19:06.900 --> 19:09.567
beautiful and chic.
It makes you want to play

19:09.567 --> 19:11.767
ping-pong.
- Mm.

19:11.767 --> 19:14.667
So here's the deal, I
wanted to come over and talk to

19:14.667 --> 19:18.633
you in person because we've all
been trying to figure out what

19:18.633 --> 19:21.867
to do for your birthday.
Nobody can think of what to do

19:21.867 --> 19:24.767
and I thought, "I'm just gonna
come over here and ask you what

19:24.767 --> 19:27.933
would be your dream birthday
party that we could all do to

19:27.933 --> 19:29.933
celebrate with you?"
I just don't really

19:29.933 --> 19:32.767
feel, like, it has to be
something so great.

19:32.767 --> 19:36.000
Like, it's just another day.
Like, no.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.267
Well, it's your
birthday.

19:37.267 --> 19:39.167
Why doesn't everyone
just, like, call me and wish me

19:39.167 --> 19:40.900
- a happy birthday this year?
- No.

19:40.900 --> 19:44.200
- Because... no.
- I just feel like my

19:44.200 --> 19:47.633
birthdays, I get more anxiety
about because they've always

19:47.633 --> 19:50.533
been a dark cloud, like, looms
over it.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.367
Like, it's always, like,
something, like, negative or,

19:52.367 --> 19:54.300
- like, a letdown.
- That's why we want to

19:54.300 --> 19:56.833
make it special this year.
And acknowledge it, and have a

19:56.833 --> 19:58.967
party, and make it a
celebration.

19:58.967 --> 20:02.733
And make it about how we
celebrate Khloe.

20:02.733 --> 20:04.833
Come up with a couple things
that you-- would make you really

20:04.833 --> 20:08.067
happy to do and to be with
everybody, and then we'll do the

20:08.067 --> 20:10.367
rest.
How about that?

20:10.367 --> 20:11.733
'Kay
Okay, good.

20:11.733 --> 20:15.000
- It'll be really fun.
- My mom is right.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.700
There's been a lot of negativity
in the past, so I'm gonna take

20:18.700 --> 20:21.567
control over this energy, and I
am just gonna put in the

20:21.567 --> 20:25.567
atmosphere that, no, we're gonna
have a party and it's gonna be

20:25.567 --> 20:28.100
one of the best parties I've
ever had in my life.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.233
Oh, and we need a
birthday list.

20:30.233 --> 20:34.100
'Cause I know you probably have
a list going on somewhere.

20:34.100 --> 20:38.167
So register and then send me a
link.

20:38.167 --> 20:40.333
A birthday list for
friends or are we talking about

20:40.333 --> 20:41.667
- gifts?
- Gifts.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.100
Like what you want for your
birthday.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.533
- What's your wish list?
- No, I'm not four.

20:53.533 --> 20:55.233
Where the hell's
Kourtney?

20:55.233 --> 20:56.667
- Mama.
- What?

20:56.667 --> 20:58.333
- Kourt?
- What?

20:58.333 --> 21:02.500
Do you ever think you
and the Lord are gonna get back

21:02.500 --> 21:04.667
- together?
- Do I ever?

21:04.667 --> 21:06.600
Yeah.
You know you are, right?

21:06.600 --> 21:09.233
I don't know, I
just don't know what is in God's

21:09.233 --> 21:11.967
plan.
Some days I'm like, "Ah, never."

21:11.967 --> 21:14.567
And then some days I'm like,
"Okay, maybe in the future."

21:14.567 --> 21:15.800
- Like...
- I don't think

21:15.800 --> 21:17.267
- tomorrow.
- It's not in

21:17.267 --> 21:19.267
tomorrow's plan, I'll tell you
that.

21:19.267 --> 21:21.067
No, not in
tomorrow's plan.

21:21.067 --> 21:22.800
Have you guys spoken to Rob at
all?

21:22.800 --> 21:26.000
- Nope, not once.
- Well, apparently Chyna

21:26.000 --> 21:29.867
called Mom to say, "Rob has been
sleeping all day until 3:00

21:29.867 --> 21:32.767
again, and he doesn't wake up,
and he's not motivated, he's up

21:32.767 --> 21:35.100
under me all the time."
She's like, "It's annoying, it's

21:35.100 --> 21:38.200
frus--," like, they were the
same issues he had before.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.800
And I know everyone was like,
"Oh, my God, Chyna saved him.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.700
Like, he's good now."
When you're in love, you do get,

21:43.700 --> 21:46.600
like, that high, which is great,
but now it's, like, reality

21:46.600 --> 21:48.200
time.
And I told Rob this.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.767
I said, "You know, you have some
issues that you've always had.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.433
And I'm happy that Chyna got you
out of the house, but all

21:53.433 --> 21:56.500
relationships fight, so you guys
will be okay again, but you have

21:56.500 --> 21:58.867
to deal with your issues."
Totally, as he should.

21:58.867 --> 22:01.300
I just want Rob to
know that, no matter what, like,

22:01.300 --> 22:04.233
we'll always be there for him.
He has to know he could call one

22:04.233 --> 22:06.267
of us, like he could come to my
house, I'm not gonna ask

22:06.267 --> 22:07.733
questions, just go in back into
your room.

22:07.733 --> 22:09.300
I want him to feel that
way.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.133
Like, I want him to feel like he
always has someone to turn to,

22:12.133 --> 22:14.100
- you know?
- I want my brother to

22:14.100 --> 22:17.433
know that we're all in support
of whatever makes Rob happy.

22:17.433 --> 22:20.867
And, I think, if Rob knows that
we're all supportive and

22:20.867 --> 22:23.267
onboard, Rob will feel more
comfortable to talk to us about

22:23.267 --> 22:26.333
some things and maybe if we
could give him advice, it will

22:26.333 --> 22:28.733
help his relationship.
Some tensions between Rob and

22:28.733 --> 22:31.233
Chyna will just diminish.
Do you want to call him and say

22:31.233 --> 22:33.233
"Hi?"
Yeah.

22:41.100 --> 22:42.733
I'm sorry,
the person you are trying to

22:42.733 --> 22:45.600
reach has a voice mailbox...

22:50.967 --> 22:54.967
I just can't get on

22:54.967 --> 22:57.300
the stage and talk by myself.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.233
- I called Chyna.
Mm-hmm

23:01.233 --> 23:03.100
She's like, "I just need
someone to talk to 'cause it's

23:03.100 --> 23:06.433
really hard to deal with him."
He's depressed.

23:06.433 --> 23:08.300
And I was like, "Yeah,
and we thought you were gonna

23:08.300 --> 23:09.500
help."
You know?

23:09.500 --> 23:11.733
Yeah.

23:23.267 --> 23:26.200
- Rob?
- Where is he?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.900
There's nothing but
a scale.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.667
Ricky?
Where is he? That's so weird

23:30.667 --> 23:33.200
he wouldn't be here after all
that.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.733
We really wanted to check on Rob
'cause we haven't heard from

23:35.733 --> 23:37.767
him.
So, kind of worried about him,

23:37.767 --> 23:40.533
and just want to make sure he's
okay.

23:40.533 --> 23:42.967
Should we write him
a note?

23:42.967 --> 23:46.500
"Rob, we want you to be happy
and we're here to support you in

23:46.500 --> 23:49.200
any way we can."
'Kay, what do you want to say?

23:49.200 --> 23:52.200
Call us.
Love you.

23:52.200 --> 23:59.433
- All right.
- Where is he?

23:59.433 --> 24:01.000
- I called Chyna.
Mm-hmm.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.033
Just to be like, "Hey,
like, I get it.

24:03.033 --> 24:05.833
You know, you guys are, like,
not vibing, but I just want you

24:05.833 --> 24:09.600
to know, like, I'm here if you
need to like, talk about

24:09.600 --> 24:11.800
anything."
She's like, "Honestly, I used to

24:11.800 --> 24:14.400
think it was all you guys."
Yeah?

24:14.400 --> 24:16.433
'Cause that's, like, the
way that it is, like, perceived

24:16.433 --> 24:18.167
- or whatever.
- Now, she's like, "I just

24:18.167 --> 24:23.400
need someone to talk to 'cause
it's really hard to, um, deal

24:23.400 --> 24:24.633
with him."
Mm-hmm.

24:24.633 --> 24:26.633
She's like, "I just want
someone that's like, motivated,

24:26.633 --> 24:29.100
and that'll, like, get up and
like, do something."

24:29.100 --> 24:30.767
Yeah, but he's
depressed.

24:30.767 --> 24:33.667
Yeah.
And so I said-- you know, she's

24:33.667 --> 24:36.133
like, "I could see now that
it's, like, you guys all tried

24:36.133 --> 24:38.200
to help him."
And I was like, "Yeah, and we

24:38.200 --> 24:39.667
thought you were gonna help."
You know?

24:39.667 --> 24:43.700
But I also said, like, "Don't
give him false hope if you

24:43.700 --> 24:45.733
don't, like, want to be with
him, you know?"

24:45.733 --> 24:48.933
- Yeah.
- I think there's always

24:48.933 --> 24:51.733
two sides to every story and I
want to be supportive of both.

24:51.733 --> 24:55.767
I mean, Chyna's now family and,
you know, I want her to be calm

24:55.767 --> 24:57.767
and feel like she has a support
system.

24:57.767 --> 25:01.933
You know, I do want her to feel
like she has me to talk to and

25:01.933 --> 25:05.200
to, you know, vent to if she
needs something, just like my

25:05.200 --> 25:08.167
brother can.
And I just want everything to be

25:08.167 --> 25:10.267
cool and I think they just need
to talk.

25:10.267 --> 25:12.167
It's been real,
Rob.

25:12.167 --> 25:14.500
Hopefully, he'll call
us.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.667
Hello.

Like... he's not the easiest

29:56.200 --> 29:58.933
person on the planet to deal
with.

29:58.933 --> 30:02.400
So maybe if she felt like we
were all, like, inviting her to

30:02.400 --> 30:05.133
your party, then she would feel,
like, more accepted, 'cause it's

30:05.133 --> 30:07.100
like...
You know what I mean?

30:07.100 --> 30:11.833
Imagine if you were in her
shoes.

30:11.833 --> 30:14.833
- I'll call her.
- Would she want to go

30:14.833 --> 30:17.867
- even if Rob... wasn't there?
- Yeah, I mean, if I was

30:17.867 --> 30:20.967
like, "Hey, I'm going, come."
Like, I'm sure she would love to

30:20.967 --> 30:23.433
hear that, like, you want her to
go, too.

30:23.433 --> 30:25.500
You know what I mean?
I think she feels like you don't

30:25.500 --> 30:28.567
- like her.
- I don't know her.

30:28.567 --> 30:32.333
Obviously, when Rob first told
me about his relationship with

30:32.333 --> 30:35.833
Chyna, how I first found out, it
just wasn't on good terms.

30:35.833 --> 30:39.000
But I don't really know Chyna.
I've never hung out with her

30:39.000 --> 30:40.733
one-on-one.
I've never had her phone number.

30:40.733 --> 30:43.433
None of that.
And I want to change that.

30:43.433 --> 30:45.633
I want to change the energy
within the family, I want to

30:45.633 --> 30:49.267
make everything just happy and
that we're all just accepting of

30:49.267 --> 30:52.500
one another.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.233
- Hello?
- Hey.

30:54.233 --> 30:56.467
- Hi, hey!
- What are you doing?

30:56.467 --> 30:59.700
- How are you feeling?
- Hey, I'm doing good.

30:59.700 --> 31:03.000
I just literally, like, got King
from school and about to make

31:03.000 --> 31:07.567
- some broth and chicken.
- Oh, that's good.

31:07.567 --> 31:09.800
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm sitting here

31:09.800 --> 31:12.400
- with Khloe...
- Hi! Hey, Khlo.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.900
- How are you?
- How you doing?

31:14.900 --> 31:17.300
I'm good, thank you.
How are you?

31:17.300 --> 31:20.267
- Good. Yeah, good.
- Um, well, I am having

31:20.267 --> 31:23.433
a birthday party and I wanted
you to know... like, I know you

31:23.433 --> 31:27.567
and Rob are, like, kind of,
like, fighting or whatever and I

31:27.567 --> 31:29.567
wanted you to know that if he
doesn't want to come, like, you

31:29.567 --> 31:33.100
- are still invited to come.
- All right, okay.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.167
Yes, thank you. Yay!
I'm so down.

31:36.167 --> 31:39.067
I am so happy that
Chyna has agreed to come to my

31:39.067 --> 31:41.800
birthday party.
I think this is a great step in

31:41.800 --> 31:45.567
such a positive direction and I
hope, with us inviting Chyna,

31:45.567 --> 31:48.233
Rob does decide to come.
I would love if Rob came.

31:48.233 --> 31:50.800
You know, it's my brother; I
wish he would be there.

31:50.800 --> 31:54.667
Yeah.

31:54.667 --> 31:57.333
- Is Rob coming?
- I don't know.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.467
- I invited him.
- It would really mean a

31:59.467 --> 32:16.667
lot to Khloe if Rob comes.
So I'm praying he shows up.

32:16.667 --> 32:18.200
- Hello.
- Hey.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.533
- Hi, Robbie Rob.
- I was just...

32:20.533 --> 32:22.933
I spilled some, like, fish in my
car.

32:22.933 --> 32:27.700
Ew. That's gonna be
brutal.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.833
I heard Rob and Chyna finally
spoke to one another, so I

32:30.833 --> 32:33.067
really wanted to stop by to see
how Rob is doing.

32:33.067 --> 32:35.067
Do you know I completely just
knew how to get here from

32:35.067 --> 32:36.667
memory?
I've only been here one time.

32:36.667 --> 32:38.100
I pulled over and was just like,
"Wait."

32:38.100 --> 32:40.133
It's confusing the first
time.

32:40.133 --> 32:44.433
Cute. Cute.
Ooh, that's a nice back yard.

32:44.433 --> 32:47.900
- Rob, oh! Tres chic.
- Yep.

32:47.900 --> 32:51.167
Oh, a lemon tree?
What?

32:51.167 --> 32:53.233
Rob, this is so cute.

32:55.067 --> 32:57.567
- What are you smiling for?
- 'Cause it's my license

32:57.567 --> 32:59.767
- picture that I didn't want to...
- Oh, I want to see.

32:59.767 --> 33:01.300
- That I... that I...
- Let me see.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.367
...wore a hat, so
I'm like...

33:03.367 --> 33:04.600
>> Look, it's so bad.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.000
- Why'd you wear a hat?
- 'Cause I just wanted to

33:07.000 --> 33:09.033
- get it over with.
- No, but you know you

33:09.033 --> 33:10.200
can't wear a hat in your
picture.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.633
No, I know.
I just didn't care 'cause I'ma

33:11.633 --> 33:15.033
go back there and retake the
picture when I'm feelin'...

33:15.033 --> 33:18.067
- Spiffy?
- ...better.

33:18.067 --> 33:20.867
Oh, my-- you got to
get out of here.

33:20.867 --> 33:24.667
What?

33:24.667 --> 33:26.200
- Kimberly.
- What?

33:26.200 --> 33:28.667
- Are, how much are you?
- I know, the neighbor did

33:28.667 --> 33:30.233
- kind of look at me like...
- You literally look

33:30.233 --> 33:32.000
...a hooker's site.
I did feel, like, uncomfortable

33:32.000 --> 33:34.100
- for one second.
- Like Rob paid for you.

33:34.100 --> 33:37.467
Like, Kim, I literally just
dropped my jaw when I saw you

33:37.467 --> 33:40.933
- from...  Wow.
- Chillax.

33:40.933 --> 33:43.833
It wasn't a bad "wow."
Anyway...

33:43.833 --> 33:45.600
what's going on?
How's everything on the

33:45.600 --> 33:47.967
- home front?
- I mean, it's been tough.

33:47.967 --> 33:51.500
It's really just, it takes
either one person to man up--

33:51.500 --> 33:53.267
obviously that's gonna have to
be me.

33:53.267 --> 33:55.900
But at the same time, I'm not
gonna argue with a female.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.667
We had a good talk the other
night, so, we'll see.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.467
I'm the one who said
arguments are normal.

34:00.467 --> 34:02.300
- It's gonna happen.
- Okay, but at that second

34:02.300 --> 34:05.267
it happened, I took it seriously
and I took it to heart.

34:05.267 --> 34:06.667
And that's 'cause
you're sensitive.

34:06.667 --> 34:09.167
And I was like, all
right, I don't even...

34:09.167 --> 34:10.567
- I don't know.
- You have to worry

34:10.567 --> 34:13.933
about Rob and how you could be
strong, and better for you and

34:13.933 --> 34:16.567
- now your baby.
- Yeah, I'm-- well, I'm

34:16.567 --> 34:18.033
- fine.
- Don't you want

34:18.033 --> 34:20.367
- to get your  together?
- I do. My plan is not to

34:20.367 --> 34:23.500
have a kid with somebody and not
be with the person, that's just

34:23.500 --> 34:26.033
- bizarre to me.
- I know Rob and Chyna

34:26.033 --> 34:29.833
have a long way to go, but I'm
really happy that they are

34:29.833 --> 34:32.167
working things out.
Relationships are hard, no

34:32.167 --> 34:37.267
matter what and as long as Rob
is trying and starts really

34:37.267 --> 34:40.567
engaging and communicating,
that's all I could ask for, but

34:40.567 --> 34:43.400
he has to figure it out and this
is, like, baby steps to his

34:43.400 --> 34:45.600
life.
What are you doing on Monday,

34:45.600 --> 34:47.433
Rob?
Are you coming to my birthday

34:47.433 --> 34:49.667
- party?
- I'm not sure.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.067
- I don't know.
- Where else are you

34:51.067 --> 34:54.733
gonna be?
There's alcohol, there's food,

34:54.733 --> 34:58.033
there's games, there's a
photo booth, and I invited

34:58.033 --> 35:00.600
- Chyna.
- Well, it'll probably

35:00.600 --> 35:03.733
make me want to go.
It's always helpful to go with

35:03.733 --> 35:05.633
- somebody.
- Yeah.

35:05.633 --> 35:08.733
- I mean, I get it.
Uh-- Kim, your selfie

35:08.733 --> 35:11.900
- book is here?
- You guys, look what Rob

35:11.900 --> 35:13.867
- reads.
- It's not a reading

35:13.867 --> 35:16.033
- book, there's no words in it.
- There is words, you

35:16.033 --> 35:28.833
- ass.
- "Kim Kardashian."

35:28.833 --> 35:30.433
There's the birthday
girl.

35:30.433 --> 35:31.800
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.833
- Hi, mom.
- Hi!

35:32.833 --> 35:35.067
- You look beautiful.
- Hi, guys.

35:35.067 --> 35:39.733
I am super excited for
my birthday party, now that it's

35:39.733 --> 35:42.067
here and I, you know, can't turn
back.

35:42.067 --> 35:43.967
We're ready to go inside.

35:46.167 --> 35:50.567
- Oh! This is so cute.
- I decide on Dave &

35:50.567 --> 35:53.467
Buster's because they serve
alcohol and play games.

35:53.467 --> 35:55.400
The best of both worlds.

35:59.067 --> 36:03.800
- Did you invite people?
- Yeah.

36:03.800 --> 36:09.200
- Where is everyone?
- It's 7:40...

36:09.200 --> 36:13.667
- The party started at 7.
- There's nobody here.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.667
Holy , Dave & Buster's is
huge.

36:15.667 --> 36:17.733
I didn't realize how big this
place was.

36:17.733 --> 36:22.400
How many people did you invite?
I really hope people show up.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.333
- Relax.
- Allie's on her way.

36:25.333 --> 36:30.567
There's Scott, just walked in.
And there's North and Kim.

36:30.567 --> 36:36.067
Hi!
Oh, my goodness, look at this.

36:36.067 --> 36:38.200
- Happy birthday.
- Hi!

36:38.200 --> 36:43.367
Stop. Uh-uh.
We're matching?

36:43.367 --> 36:45.233
- Is that planned?
- You didn't tell me

36:45.233 --> 36:47.267
- you got us matching ones.
- I just got all the

36:47.267 --> 36:51.200
- dope ones.
- Hi!

36:56.967 --> 36:59.500
To Khloe's birthday.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.933
Happy birthday, Khloe!

37:02.933 --> 37:07.033
Go, go, go!

37:07.033 --> 37:09.200
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.100
Ah!

37:14.833 --> 37:17.867
- Oh!
- Happy birthday.

37:17.867 --> 37:20.500
Is Rob coming?
I keep asking him, but I-I don't

37:20.500 --> 37:22.167
- get a response.
- I don't know, lets

37:22.167 --> 37:26.367
facetime him.
He's never going to answer.

37:26.367 --> 37:28.233
Have you talked to
Rob?

37:28.233 --> 37:31.967
- Not in, like, a week.
- I just want everything

37:31.967 --> 37:35.567
to go perfectly tonight and it
would really mean a lot to Khloe

37:35.567 --> 37:39.733
if Rob comes.
So, I'm praying he shows up.

37:39.733 --> 37:42.467
- Is Rob coming?
- I don't know.

37:42.467 --> 37:45.033
I invited him.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.233
- Is Rob coming?
- I don't know.

37:56.233 --> 38:00.267
- I invited him.
- There's Chrissy and

38:00.267 --> 38:02.767
- John. And me.
- Let me get out of the

38:02.767 --> 38:07.100
- way.
- We're having so

38:07.100 --> 38:10.600
much fun celebrating Khloe's
birthday, but Khloe really

38:10.600 --> 38:14.667
misses Rob.
It's definitely not the same

38:14.667 --> 38:16.567
without him.

38:23.233 --> 38:29.533
Rob!

38:29.533 --> 38:31.867
Oh, my God, it means,
like, the world to me to have my

38:31.867 --> 38:34.500
brother at my birthday.
I can't remember the last time

38:34.500 --> 38:36.767
my brother was at a family
holiday.

38:36.767 --> 38:39.167
So, to have him here...
it's pretty awesome.

38:39.167 --> 38:42.167
- Oh, my God, hi!
- Rob!

38:42.167 --> 38:46.100
Happy birthday.
How are you?

38:46.100 --> 38:51.000
- I love you.
- Good. I love you.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.867
I can't believe they're

38:53.867 --> 38:58.367
here. I am overjoyed.
Ooh, I'm so happy you're here.

38:58.367 --> 39:00.900
- Say hi to Kanye.
- Hey, man.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.233
- Hey.
- It's such a special

39:03.233 --> 39:06.367
family day, and we're all here
celebrating.

39:06.367 --> 39:09.867
We're so used to not having Rob
and it-- there's a sadness.

39:09.867 --> 39:12.933
There's always a sadness in the
air when Rob's not here.

39:12.933 --> 39:15.900
And so, tonight, we don't have
the sadness.

39:15.900 --> 39:18.533
Happy birthday.
I love you.

39:18.533 --> 39:23.033
- Hey.
- You're our...

39:23.033 --> 39:24.833
- Did you guys talk?
- Yeah, we talked.

39:24.833 --> 39:26.767
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. Did you say hi to

39:26.767 --> 39:29.067
- her?
- No.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.667
- Come here.
- Oh, my God.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.567
- Chyna.
- Oh, my God.

39:32.567 --> 39:35.100
- Okay, all right, thank you.
- Happy birthday.

39:35.100 --> 39:38.367
- You look bomb.
- Thank you, thank you.

39:38.367 --> 39:40.200
- Aww...
- I'm so round, right?

39:40.200 --> 39:43.600
- But you're just belly.
- Earlier it was like

39:43.600 --> 39:46.733
- smaller, it's like it grew.
- Thank you.

39:46.733 --> 39:49.000
I'm so glad you
invited-- I was invited, I was

39:49.000 --> 39:51.733
like, "Yay."
I'm happy you're here.

39:51.733 --> 39:55.333
- Thank you for coming.
- You're so sweet.

39:55.333 --> 39:58.567
I am grateful that
Chyna came to my birthday party,

39:58.567 --> 40:02.200
'cause I think without her, Rob
wouldn't have come here.

40:02.200 --> 40:07.467
And it shows me how much Chyna
does care about Rob, because

40:07.467 --> 40:10.233
that's an intimidating
situation to walk into.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.467
I'm trying to think,
I'm like five months now, so I'm

40:12.467 --> 40:15.933
wondering, like, how much bigger
am I gonna get, you think?

40:15.933 --> 40:18.300
Bigger.

40:18.300 --> 40:21.433
I'm so happy that Rob
and Chyna finally came.

40:21.433 --> 40:24.900
And I'm just glad that they can
work it out, 'cause you know,

40:24.900 --> 40:26.200
it's like, they have a baby on
the way.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.733
I just want everything to be
cool.

40:27.733 --> 40:30.300
At the end of the day, we just
want both of them to be happy.

40:30.300 --> 40:32.433
- Mom, Rob.
- Oh, my God.

40:32.433 --> 40:35.333
>> I want to take a

40:35.333 --> 40:37.133
picture with Khloe 'cause it's
her birthday.

40:37.133 --> 40:39.300
Khloe, can we go in the
photo booth with you?

40:39.300 --> 40:41.267
- Yeah, let's go.
- Go in the photo booth.

40:41.267 --> 40:43.700
This has honestly been
one of the best birthdays that

40:43.700 --> 40:47.533
I've had in so many years.
I'm just happy that I had this

40:47.533 --> 40:50.867
party, that everybody came here,
that my brother and Chyna came,

40:50.867 --> 40:53.667

tradition for my birthdays to

Do you know where the baby is

41:24.233 --> 41:25.567

41:25.567 --> 41:27.333
I feel like this is

41:27.333 --> 41:29.733
the first time we've hit the
streets together in a long time.

It's almost like he was in jail.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.833
- Hey, do this one.
- Oh, that's nice!

41:33.833 --> 41:35.933
It's a big change to go

from being inside for, like,
four years to now being outside.
