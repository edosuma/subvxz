[sirens and alarms blaring]

00:12.180 --> 00:13.881
What are these lowlifes trying to steal?

00:13.883 --> 00:15.916
Report says Vibranium.

00:15.918 --> 00:18.185
Whatever happened to stealing money?

00:18.187 --> 00:21.588
Where you been?
Science is the new currency.

Albert Einstein once said,</i>

<i>"Learn from yesterday,

<i>Well, it's been two weeks ago yesterday</i>

00:32.927 --> 00:35.320
<i>that I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.</i>

00:35.355 --> 00:38.072
<i>So I'm still figuring that out.</i>

00:38.074 --> 00:40.407
<i>Today, however, is what I live for...</i>

00:40.409 --> 00:44.711
making my debut and showing
everyone what I'm capable of.

00:44.713 --> 00:48.892
From this moment on,
the world will know me as...

00:48.979 --> 00:50.788
Spider-Man!

00:51.886 --> 00:54.555
Come on, man. [pigeon cooing]
You're ruining my moment.

00:54.557 --> 00:56.890
Shoo! Shoo!

00:56.892 --> 01:00.794
Oh, great. I'm supposed
to stick to walls, not pigeons.

01:00.796 --> 01:02.196
W-W-Whoa!

01:02.197 --> 01:03.309
[crash]

01:04.965 --> 01:07.734
- Huh?
- Get away from my pigeon coop!

01:07.736 --> 01:08.586
Oh, you don't understand.

01:08.587 --> 01:10.771
- I'm not stealing him. He's stuck to me.
- You kids get out of here!

01:10.773 --> 01:13.274
- Always messing with my pigeons.
- Great time to learn how

01:13.275 --> 01:15.485
to release, Spidey.
[grunts]

01:17.232 --> 01:18.583
Ahhh!

01:19.581 --> 01:20.781
Good thing I know about webbing.

01:20.783 --> 01:24.251
- Shouldn't you be in school? I told you...
- Or not.

01:24.253 --> 01:27.821
Seems 200 PSI isn't enough
to launch webbing properly.

01:27.823 --> 01:29.456
Ahhh!

01:33.161 --> 01:34.561
Get off my roof, you menace!
[continuing]

01:34.563 --> 01:36.930
Today isn't the
best day to do this.

01:43.772 --> 01:46.440
<i>Flash Thompson's mom wants me
to tutor him in science,</i>

01:46.442 --> 01:49.776

01:49.778 --> 01:53.147
<i>I know it's the right thing to do,
but man, it would be nice</i>

01:53.149 --> 01:55.849

01:55.851 --> 01:59.186

<i>Sometimes, when a person can't
figure out what that gift is,</i>

02:03.826 --> 02:06.527
<i>they take it out on other people.</i>

02:06.529 --> 02:09.096
<i>- Does that make sense?
- Not really.</i>

02:09.098 --> 02:11.832
<i>[chuckles] Too bad,</i>

02:11.834 --> 02:15.702
<i>'cause I thought my gift
was making sense of things.</i>

02:15.704 --> 02:18.205
<i>Goodness knows it isn't science.</i>

02:21.843 --> 02:26.480
<i>I think all it needs
is a little iron oxide.</i>

02:26.482 --> 02:29.816
<i>[cuckoos]
Ha-ha. Look at that.</i>

02:29.818 --> 02:33.720
<i>You know, Pete, I don't know
as much about science as you do,</i>

02:33.722 --> 02:39.393
<i>but there's always been one formula
that worked for me in any situation.</i>

02:39.395 --> 02:43.730
<i>With great power,
comes great responsibility.</i>

02:43.732 --> 02:45.999
<i>That's not a real thing.</i>

02:46.001 --> 02:48.702
<i>You just made that up.
[camera shutter clicks]</i>

02:48.704 --> 02:50.082
<i>What? Sure it is.</i>

02:50.083 --> 02:54.805
<i>- Isn't that a thing? I know the P is?
- Yeah, it's Phosphorus. </i>

02:54.840 --> 02:57.811
<i>And the only thing G
stands for is goofy.</i>

02:57.813 --> 03:01.348
<i>Like I said, real or not,
it's always worked for me.</i>

03:01.350 --> 03:05.586

start tutoring Flash next week.</i>

You're right, Uncle Ben.

03:10.526 --> 03:12.926
With great power
comes great responsibility.

03:12.928 --> 03:14.528
I need to do this.

03:14.530 --> 03:16.863
250 PSI should do the trick.

03:16.865 --> 03:18.865

Oh, no you don't!

[music]

03:27.775 --> 03:30.777

I got this pressure right.

03:30.779 --> 03:33.747
[grunts]
Whoo-hoo!

03:33.749 --> 03:35.716
It's working. It's working.

03:35.718 --> 03:36.984
Oh, overheating.

03:41.923 --> 03:46.093
[echoing] Uh-oh. If my calculations
are correct, at this speed,

03:46.095 --> 03:49.463
I've got 15 seconds to get everyone
in a two block radius out of danger.

03:49.465 --> 03:52.699
That includes the old lady
on the corner,

03:52.701 --> 03:54.601
the mother and kid
crossing the street,

03:54.603 --> 03:56.370

That's it.

03:59.908 --> 04:02.142

Hand it over. [cheering]

04:27.670 --> 04:30.222
Congrats, guys.
That's called an ollie.

04:30.322 --> 04:33.006

04:34.909 --> 04:38.945

Ah, much better.

05:09.845 --> 05:11.478
It's quite a scream you got there.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.713

What? I'm sorry, I can't hear
well with these things on.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.036

- Easy, fella. My ears are starting to pop.

Let go of me, you fool.

05:45.681 --> 05:47.948
I did this with a pigeon friend
of yours earlier.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.985
Oh, come on.

05:51.986 --> 05:54.301
[glass shatters]

05:54.322 --> 05:56.583

Ahhh.

06:11.272 --> 06:12.739
[police sirens]

06:12.741 --> 06:15.108
Now to make a cage for this bird.

06:16.911 --> 06:20.113
[screeching]

06:20.115 --> 06:23.016
Don't tell me you forgot
about my webmuffs?

06:23.018 --> 06:24.518
That wasn't for you.

06:24.520 --> 06:30.090
It's either stop me
or save them, hero.

06:30.091 --> 06:31.631
[cackling]

06:36.097 --> 06:38.098
Your first villain
and you let him escape.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.033
I'm running out of webs.
Maybe I should...

06:40.035 --> 06:43.937
- Ah, hey, Webhead.
- It's Spider-Man, actually.

06:43.939 --> 06:48.375
Great. How are we supposed to get
these guys out of your web ball?

06:48.377 --> 06:53.380
Oh, it dissolves in an hour.
I think.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.917
Eh, this is far enough.

06:56.919 --> 06:59.152
But Horizon High
isn't for a few more blocks, sir.

06:59.154 --> 07:02.322
It maybe a new school, Bernie,
but it's the same old routine.

07:02.324 --> 07:06.852
You know I like to walk these
last few blocks with my pal Pete.

07:08.629 --> 07:12.966
Ah. Oh. Ah!
Sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia!

07:12.968 --> 07:16.169
Can't you just say brain freeze
like everyone else?

07:16.171 --> 07:19.172
Ah, but that wouldn't be accurate.

07:19.174 --> 07:21.408
One theory is,
when the brain senses cold,

07:21.410 --> 07:24.912
it moves the blood through
the cerebral artery to regulate

07:24.913 --> 07:28.415
the temperature, so technically
you should be saying "heat blast."

07:28.417 --> 07:30.250
[chuckles]
Nerd.

07:30.252 --> 07:32.752
See, you're the one who should
be going to Horizon High.

07:32.754 --> 07:35.989
In fact, why don't you apply?
You'd be a slam dunk.

07:35.991 --> 07:38.992
I don't know. Aunt Mae and I
are barely scraping by,

07:38.994 --> 07:40.827
now that Uncle Ben is gone.

07:40.829 --> 07:44.030
- I can't ask any more from her.
- Smoothies are on me.

07:44.032 --> 07:47.167
That's not what I meant. I'm
glad we still do this, Harry.

07:47.169 --> 07:48.835
I miss you not being in school.

07:48.837 --> 07:51.137
Yeah, well, you're gonna see me
a lot sooner than you think,

07:51.139 --> 07:53.206
A slot has opened up at Horizon High,

07:53.208 --> 07:56.042
so Max is giving a recruitment
presentation at Midtown today.

07:56.044 --> 07:59.679
That's today? Max Modell
is coming to school today?!

07:59.681 --> 08:01.681
- How do I look?
- Pretty rattled for a guy

08:01.683 --> 08:03.884
who's not interested in applying.

08:03.886 --> 08:06.219
No, I just, I mean, it's Max Modell.

08:06.221 --> 08:08.188
He's my idol.
I know everything about him.

08:08.190 --> 08:11.224
I even volunteered to come in early
and help set up on the day he...

08:11.226 --> 08:15.061
Oh, no. I volunteered to come
in early and help set up today!

08:15.063 --> 08:16.229
<i>Liz Alan is gonna kill me.</i>

08:16.231 --> 08:18.771
Same old Parker.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.952
Okay. I just need to reprogram

08:21.953 --> 08:26.840
<i>- the temperature threshold.
- Parker!</i>

08:26.842 --> 08:30.243
- You know you missed it?
- I know. I'm sorry, Liz.

08:30.245 --> 08:33.346
But once I missed it, I figured I'd
just catch up on some schoolwork.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.482
You're always at the wrong
place at the wrong time, Parker.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.183
Luckily, Randy was here to help.

08:38.186 --> 08:41.544
- Yeah, more like I was ordered to help.
- Thanks, Randy.

08:41.578 --> 08:44.224
What temperature
do you think a viscous liquid

08:44.226 --> 08:47.260
needs to reach before it
reaches it's maximum density?

08:47.262 --> 08:49.930
Got me?
You're the egghead, remember?

08:49.932 --> 08:53.033
I'm just the guy doing a story on
Max Modell for the school's Website.

08:53.035 --> 08:56.169
How awesome is it that there's a
school specifically for geniuses

08:56.171 --> 08:58.104
and that they're coming
here for recruits?

08:58.106 --> 09:02.042
Huh. It can't be that good if
that snob Harry Osborn got in.

09:02.044 --> 09:06.546
As far as I can tell, Horizon High
is on par with a 4H club.

09:06.548 --> 09:11.251
Exactly, if the four H's are
hardworking heroes who help?

09:11.253 --> 09:14.788
One of your H's is a W, Parker.

09:14.790 --> 09:17.958
Hey, I'm a science geek,
not a spelling geek.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.260
Well, if Horizon High is legit,

09:20.262 --> 09:23.530
then Alistair Smyth is sure
to be invited in next.

09:23.532 --> 09:27.767
You're to good for them, son.
Max Modell is an overrated lab assistant.

09:27.769 --> 09:30.203
I knew him back in the day,
and he's a fraud.

09:30.205 --> 09:32.205
Whatever you say, Mr. Smythe.

09:32.207 --> 09:33.573
[phone ringing]

09:33.575 --> 09:37.007
Oh, it's 9:00.
We should be starting.

09:37.479 --> 09:40.146
<i>[over mic]
Welcome, students of Midtown High.</i>

09:40.148 --> 09:44.150
<i>It isn't often a scientist gets
called a genius within his lifetime.</i>

09:44.152 --> 09:46.119
Can we call him a giant dufus?

09:46.121 --> 09:49.089
<i>But when he creates a private
school for young minds</i>

09:49.091 --> 09:50.890
<i>looking to pursue their dreams,</i>

09:50.892 --> 09:53.727
<i>we also get to call him a roll model.</i>

09:53.729 --> 09:55.595
<i>Ladies and Gentleman,</i>

09:55.597 --> 09:58.898
<i>I give you Max Modell
from Horizon High.</i>

09:58.900 --> 10:01.301
[cheering]
[whistles]

10:01.303 --> 10:02.802
Max Modell!

10:02.804 --> 10:04.938
Good morning, everyone.

10:04.940 --> 10:08.308
You know, I could spend
a lot of time talking about

10:08.310 --> 10:11.177
the cool things we're doing
over at Horizon High.

10:12.513 --> 10:14.147
What...

10:14.149 --> 10:17.651
Like I said, I could talk about them,
[both gasp]

10:17.653 --> 10:19.486
but I'd rather show you,
[music]

10:19.488 --> 10:21.788
with our new hologram prototype.

10:21.790 --> 10:23.590
[murmuring]

10:23.592 --> 10:26.259
[Modell] Created by the
fertile minds at Horizon High.

10:26.261 --> 10:28.495
Where I'm excited to say,

10:28.497 --> 10:33.333
we have one last slot that needs
to be filled this semester.

10:33.335 --> 10:35.151
Oh...
[grunts]

10:37.171 --> 10:39.372
[chuckles]
Well, it's not that simple.

10:39.374 --> 10:42.709
You see, in order to
be a student at Horizon,

10:42.711 --> 10:44.878
you have to have a certain
kind of intellect.

10:47.114 --> 10:50.950
An intellect that can solve an
equation like this, for example.

10:50.952 --> 10:55.989
Wow, that equation seems to explain
how moisture interacts with... vibration.

10:55.991 --> 11:00.160
An intellect like Anya Corazon
or Miles Morales.

11:00.162 --> 11:04.564
Students at Horizon who
specialize in elemental physics.

11:04.566 --> 11:07.567
That's your cue! Go.

11:07.569 --> 11:10.403
- [Mr. Smythe] Osborn.
- Huh? Oh, Mr. Smythe.

11:10.405 --> 11:12.739
What do you need?
That contraption is making

11:12.741 --> 11:16.376
an odd humming noise.
Is it supposed to do that?

11:16.378 --> 11:19.746
- Looks fine.
- Don't be so smug.

11:19.748 --> 11:22.403
- You're not the...
- [Modell] And in the area of chemistry,

11:22.438 --> 11:27.220
- your very own, Harry Osborn.
- [audience cheering] I gotta go.

11:27.222 --> 11:32.058
Keep talking Modell. I'm gonna to
bring you and your whole school down.

11:32.060 --> 11:35.954
<i>Thanks Max. At Horizon High,
kids are doing things</i>

11:35.989 --> 11:37.931
<i>they could
have only dreamed of before.</i>

11:37.933 --> 11:40.567
<i>Like Anya and her
Vibranium reactor. Anya?</i>

11:40.569 --> 11:44.370
Once, Vibranium could only be
found in the nation of Wakanda,

11:44.372 --> 11:47.440
but with my Vibranium reactor,
there will be enough Vibranium...

11:47.442 --> 11:50.243
[warbling]
Oh, no. Spider sense going nuts.

11:50.245 --> 11:53.446
[electricity cracking]
[gasping]

11:53.447 --> 11:56.871
[boom]
[screaming]

11:58.552 --> 12:02.422
Fortunately in this chaos,
no one will notice me switch to...

12:05.126 --> 12:07.060
Spider-Man!

12:07.062 --> 12:09.295
Some how that Vibranium
is working in reverse.

12:09.297 --> 12:12.932
Instead of absorbing vibrations,
it's producing them.

12:12.934 --> 12:15.435
Let's hope I got this web
shooter working right.

12:15.437 --> 12:18.683
Huh?

12:18.760 --> 12:20.398
Whoa. It's true Parker,

12:20.399 --> 12:24.076
you are always in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

12:27.458 --> 12:31.017
[groaning]

12:35.823 --> 12:37.290
Ta-da!

12:37.292 --> 12:41.628
- Who's that guy?
- Uh-oh.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.863
The reactor just keeps going.

12:44.999 --> 12:46.399
Gotta cut the power.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.470
[gulps]

12:53.407 --> 12:55.742
<i>Detach the impulse valve
with the discharge.</i>

12:55.744 --> 12:57.811
There, that ought to stop you.

13:00.481 --> 13:01.915
[grunts]

13:01.917 --> 13:05.013
[whirrs down]

13:05.586 --> 13:07.520
Huh?
[gasps]

13:07.522 --> 13:10.156
Let's try and avoid
barbequed spider, shall we?

13:10.158 --> 13:13.960
Whoo! Luckily,
I still have my Parker clothes.

13:13.962 --> 13:15.929
I shut the reactor off.

13:15.931 --> 13:17.697
But the fire department
is better equipped to deal

13:17.699 --> 13:19.199
with these intense flames.

13:19.201 --> 13:21.367
Great. No service.

13:21.369 --> 13:23.503
But someone needs to do something.

13:23.505 --> 13:26.439
And that someone is me.

13:26.441 --> 13:28.875
Well, hello, Max's equation.

13:28.877 --> 13:32.145
That gives me an idea.

13:32.147 --> 13:34.380
Piggyback on
that Vibranium output,

13:34.382 --> 13:38.317
absorb some of this
condensation and re-direct it.

13:39.353 --> 13:40.987
Re-purpose these wires in.

13:40.989 --> 13:43.476
[beeps, whirring up]

13:47.294 --> 13:50.596
[all cheering]
[Spider-Man] Nice.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.069
All my work!
What did you do?

13:56.071 --> 13:58.338
Uh, sorry.

13:58.340 --> 14:01.407
Why couldn't you just let
that beetle kid handle it.

14:01.409 --> 14:04.577
I think he's Spider-Man.

14:04.579 --> 14:06.813
[groans]

14:06.815 --> 14:08.982
Hey, don't let it bother you pal.

14:08.984 --> 14:11.417
The bad news
is she'll hate you for life.

14:11.419 --> 14:15.388
But the good news is,
you don't go to her school.

14:15.390 --> 14:19.759
And who is this young man I have
to thank for putting out the fire?

14:19.761 --> 14:23.429
This is Peter Parker,
the one I've been telling you about.

14:23.431 --> 14:25.598
Well, Peter, I'm impressed.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.567
Not only did you solve my equation,

14:27.569 --> 14:30.203
but you also put it to practical use.

14:30.205 --> 14:32.438
Indoor storm clouds are
something I've been toying with,

14:32.440 --> 14:34.774
and you're the only
one who figured it out.

14:34.776 --> 14:39.660
- Mr. Modell, look! I solved it too.
- Sorry, young man.

14:39.695 --> 14:42.682
That looks more like
a Rorschach test than an answer.

14:48.222 --> 14:50.790
- Come with me, Peter.
- Huh?

14:50.792 --> 14:54.661
- Parker!
- Don't worry son.

14:54.662 --> 14:56.596
This will all get fixed.

14:56.598 --> 14:59.532
I appreciate what
you did here today, Peter.

14:59.534 --> 15:03.403
And it's with great pleasure
that I'd like to offer you

15:03.404 --> 15:06.806
- the remaining slot at Horizon.
- [gasps] Are you kidding me?

15:06.808 --> 15:09.475
Horizon High should be shut down.

15:09.477 --> 15:11.444
What you did here today
was reckless.

15:11.446 --> 15:14.814
My students know exactly
what they're doing, Spencer.

15:14.816 --> 15:18.618
And if I had to guess, I'd say some
tampering occurred on this campus.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.489
Don't be foolish. You
want to point fingers?

15:21.524 --> 15:22.455
Point them at your own people.

15:22.457 --> 15:25.725
I know for a fact that Harry
Osborn was tinkering around

15:25.727 --> 15:27.994
with the reactor
before the presentation.

15:27.996 --> 15:30.496
What?
That can't be.

15:30.498 --> 15:33.633
And the board of education
states that any student

15:33.635 --> 15:37.070
accused of sabotage
shall be suspended indefinitely.

15:37.072 --> 15:38.471
Pending an investigation.

15:38.473 --> 15:42.308
You're a devious person, Spencer.

15:42.310 --> 15:44.077
But you're right.

15:44.079 --> 15:48.581
Harry, I hate to say it,
but pending a brief investigation,

15:48.583 --> 15:50.850
I'm afraid you'll have
to be suspended.

15:50.852 --> 15:53.186
- What?
- What? You can't do that.

15:53.188 --> 15:56.942
- I don't know what he's showing you, but...
- Honest devastation!

15:56.977 --> 16:00.860
The perfect time for the Vulture
to pick through the remains.

16:00.862 --> 16:02.328
<i>[Peter and Harry]
Max!</i>

16:02.330 --> 16:04.464
<i>[laughing]
[student] Oh, my God!</i>

16:04.466 --> 16:06.818
I'll go get help.

16:08.102 --> 16:11.220
More like I'll find my costume
so I can change back to...

16:11.638 --> 16:12.538
Oh, right.

16:12.540 --> 16:17.076
Mental note: make costume out of
flame resistant material next time.

16:21.382 --> 16:23.149
Let go of me, Adrian.

16:23.151 --> 16:27.520
Adrian Toomes was a pathetic
employee of yours, Modell.

16:27.522 --> 16:30.323
Fired with insufficient cause.

16:30.325 --> 16:32.658
I am the Vulture.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.695
Adrian, you were fired
for stealing equipment.

16:35.697 --> 16:38.195
[screaming]

16:39.733 --> 16:41.801
That equipment was mine.

16:41.803 --> 16:43.903
[yelps]

16:43.905 --> 16:47.340
Everything you worked on under
my employ belongs to Horizon.

16:47.342 --> 16:51.344
Yes. But my anti-gravity
Vulture suit is all me.

16:51.346 --> 16:53.546
And it needs Vibranium to work.

16:53.548 --> 16:56.743
[screaming]

16:58.585 --> 17:00.053
You again.

17:00.055 --> 17:02.898
I knew red and blue
would be memorable.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.262
I've got you.

17:08.663 --> 17:11.329
Yes. But I've got you.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.667
Let's see how you like being
stabbed in the back,

17:15.670 --> 17:17.569
like Modell did to me.

17:17.571 --> 17:19.739
[screaming]
Max! No!

17:19.741 --> 17:21.074
Let go.

17:22.843 --> 17:26.636
Can't let my first day
turn out to be Max's last.

17:27.848 --> 17:29.248
[Max screaming]

17:36.790 --> 17:39.125
Thanks, Flying Squirrel.

17:39.127 --> 17:41.794
Well, better than a beetle.
At least you're safe.

17:41.796 --> 17:44.263
Ah, not yet, we're not.

17:44.265 --> 17:46.632
The Vulture is headed back
to the school.

17:46.634 --> 17:50.703
- It's the Vibranium he wants.
- Then hang on.

17:50.705 --> 17:52.472
<i>[Max] You sure you know
how to fly this thing?</i>

17:52.474 --> 17:53.773
<i>[Spider-Man] Nope.</i>

17:57.578 --> 18:00.780
You? I told you, I had
everything under control.

18:00.782 --> 18:04.484
Then why am I not in
possession of the Vibranium?

18:04.486 --> 18:08.121
I needed to take care of
some personal business first.

18:08.123 --> 18:13.059
[scoffs] Your trivial grudges
are of no concern to me.

18:13.061 --> 18:15.562
[screams]
[grunts]

18:16.330 --> 18:18.331
Dad, are you okay?

18:18.333 --> 18:20.433
I'm gonna make the Vulture
pay for this.

18:20.435 --> 18:24.303
You'll do no such thing.
Now that I have the Vibranium,

18:24.305 --> 18:27.673
it will take someone much
stronger than you to take me down.

18:27.675 --> 18:29.775
- [Spider-Man] You talking about me?
- Huh?

18:29.777 --> 18:31.077
[grunts]

18:31.079 --> 18:32.678
Huh?

18:32.680 --> 18:34.647
No bother.

18:34.649 --> 18:38.784
I shall destroy you all just the same.

18:38.786 --> 18:40.753
[screams, groans]

18:40.755 --> 18:43.256
Bull's-eye, or Vulture's Eye.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.425
[man] Nice work for a catcher.

18:46.427 --> 18:50.196
You mind sticking around
to answer a few questions.

18:50.198 --> 18:54.066
To be honest, I've got my own
questions that need answering.

18:57.671 --> 19:00.840
I just don't see how I can
go to Horizon High, Aunt May?

19:00.842 --> 19:02.675
Peter, I thought we settled this.

19:02.677 --> 19:05.178
This is exactly what your
Uncle Ben would have wanted.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.712
And we're not going
to let him down.

19:06.714 --> 19:08.514
But how are we going
to afford it?

19:08.516 --> 19:10.183
I'll get another job, if I have to.

19:10.185 --> 19:13.670
- Are they hiring at the café here?
- Very funny.

19:13.705 --> 19:16.689
I guess it just feels weird
going there without Harry.

19:16.691 --> 19:18.691
What's he gonna say now
that he's been suspended?

19:18.693 --> 19:20.560
He's gonna say
the suspension is temporary.

19:20.562 --> 19:23.796
And you deserve to be at
that school as much as I do.

19:23.798 --> 19:25.998
Harry! You okay?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.560
- What did your dad say?
- [chuckles] Relax,

19:28.595 --> 19:30.703
he said, if the smartest
school wouldn't have me,

19:30.705 --> 19:32.738
he'd create an even smarter one.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.807
Whatever that means?
Hi, Mrs. Parker.

19:34.809 --> 19:37.843
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I was so determined

19:37.845 --> 19:39.579
to see Peter go to Horizon High,

19:39.581 --> 19:41.881
I told him I'd walk him
to school myself.

19:41.883 --> 19:45.184
Well, I can take it from here,
if you want?

19:45.186 --> 19:49.989
Thanks.
Have a great day, you two.

19:49.991 --> 19:53.526
[light rock playing]

19:53.528 --> 19:57.464
- Got the first-day jitters?
- Of course I do.

19:57.499 --> 20:00.133
It's my first day in a new
environment, so naturally my hands

20:00.134 --> 20:02.768
are processing the incoming
sensory signals sent from my...

20:02.770 --> 20:06.539
Okay, Okay. I get it.
It was a yes or no question.

20:06.541 --> 20:09.675
You're gonna fit in just fine.

20:10.344 --> 20:11.344
[slurping]

20:11.345 --> 20:15.493
- How are you feeling?
- [sighs] Confused.

20:15.528 --> 20:18.884
I mean I know those
Smythes aren't fans of mine,

20:18.886 --> 20:21.454
but it seems too devious,
even for them.

20:21.456 --> 20:24.107
Plus that spider person
showing up and destroying

20:24.108 --> 20:26.759
the reactor can't be just a coincidence.

20:26.761 --> 20:29.346
Now, I think that guy had
a hand in this somehow,

20:29.347 --> 20:31.931
- and I intend to prove it.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

20:31.933 --> 20:33.266
I think he was just trying to...

20:33.268 --> 20:35.401
Wait, you knew he was a spider?

20:35.403 --> 20:37.536
Yeah, what did you think he was?

20:37.538 --> 20:42.451
Nothing. I can always
count on you, Harry.

20:45.879 --> 20:49.315
- See you later.
- Yeah.

20:53.954 --> 20:55.788
Uh, Pete?

20:55.790 --> 20:58.891
Oh, sorry. I seem to be going
the wrong way.

20:58.893 --> 21:03.262
No, Pete. For once,
you're going the right way.

21:03.264 --> 21:06.132
<i>[thinking] "Learn from yesterday,

21:06.134 --> 21:08.234

<i>'Cause even though I made
some mistakes on my first day</i>

21:09.804 --> 21:12.238
<i>as a superhero, it still led me here.</i>

21:12.240 --> 21:13.673
<i>- Yeah.
- And with a new school</i>

21:13.675 --> 21:14.974
<i>as awesome as this to go to,</i>

21:14.976 --> 21:17.243
<i>tomorrow could only get better.
I hope.</i>

21:17.245 --> 21:19.412
[Modell] Peter Parker,
you finally made it.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.849
- Hi, Mr. Modell.
- Please, call me Max.

21:23.851 --> 21:28.220
Welcome to Horizon High.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.923
Wow.

<i>My Uncle Ben said
everyone had a gift.</i>

21:34.028 --> 21:36.062
