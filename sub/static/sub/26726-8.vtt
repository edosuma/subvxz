WEBVTT

00:10.600 --> 00:12.160
The pinch and sting!

00:13.880 --> 00:14.720
[grunts]

00:17.160 --> 00:19.960
-[both groan in frustration]
-The Pounder grounder!

00:26.880 --> 00:29.440
[crowd] Mangle! Mangle! Mangle...

00:30.200 --> 00:32.320
<i>Robo-Robozuna!</i>

00:32.400 --> 00:34.160
<i>Mangle uses the Team Natrix moves</i>

00:34.240 --> 00:38.200
<i>against them to win round three</i>
<i>and the game!</i>

00:38.280 --> 00:41.000
This can never happen again.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.320
Do you understand?

00:43.400 --> 00:46.560
I don't like losers
and neither do the people.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.280
People need real heroes in these times
and we have to supply them.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.760
We must dominate always, or people
will find their heroes elsewhere.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.800
The next time you play Team Veredus,
I want them destroyed!

01:03.320 --> 01:05.880
But we won't be playing them again
for over a month.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.480
That's changed. You'll be
playing them a little sooner now.

01:10.560 --> 01:15.560
In fact, you'll be playing them today
at Sutrium Arena.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.800
Sutrium?

01:18.360 --> 01:21.600
Isn't that the arena
with all the dangerous obstacles?

01:22.000 --> 01:27.080
Yes, and they'll be even more dangerous
once you sabotage the obstacles,

01:27.160 --> 01:29.000
so that you can control them.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.040
Ah, that should work. [chuckles]

01:32.120 --> 01:36.960
And if it doesn't, I have a special
surprise lined up for Team Veredus.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.840
[cackles]

02:09.320 --> 02:12.920
We should fix the sensors on Mangle's
shoulder joint before we reattach it.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.720
No. We do that after we reattach the arm.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.160
Who taught you how to work on robots?

02:18.640 --> 02:21.640
Believe me, he was a lot better than
whoever taught you,

02:21.720 --> 02:25.320
because, as everyone knows,
you do the fixing first!

02:25.400 --> 02:26.240
After!

02:26.320 --> 02:27.680
-Wrong!
-Right!

02:28.000 --> 02:29.360
-Wrong!
-Right!

02:29.440 --> 02:31.400
Guys, a little teamwork?

02:31.480 --> 02:33.240
[grunts] Teamwork? But he said to...

02:33.320 --> 02:34.880
Whoa! [groans]

02:40.000 --> 02:42.720
Dad! So, how'd it go?

02:42.800 --> 02:43.720
The call?

02:43.800 --> 02:45.800
Yeah, do we have a sponsor?

02:45.880 --> 02:47.200
Maybe, maybe not.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.920
I thought we had a deal,
but Evete Neern called back.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.800
She's not sure. Said she'd do it,
but only if we win today's game.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.720
No problem. We're playing Team Pavonis.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.960
Last place team. Easy win!

02:59.320 --> 03:01.880
Yes! Going to have a sponsor!

03:01.960 --> 03:05.880
And soon going to be out of the Border
League and in the Latium League!

03:05.960 --> 03:07.040
[Zeve] Losers!

03:08.000 --> 03:10.920
-Hi, guys.
-[Ariston] Zeve? Gizi?

03:11.360 --> 03:12.960
What are you doing here?

03:13.560 --> 03:18.040
You haven't heard?
Aw! A little problem with Team Pavonis.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.680
Last-minute inspection of their workshop
turned up violations

03:21.760 --> 03:24.800
of all sorts of Robozuna regulations.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.840
Naturally, they're claiming sabotage.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.080
Huh! Losers.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.480
[Gizi] But these things
can take a while to investigate,

03:32.560 --> 03:37.640
so, in the meantime, Team Natrix
graciously offered to take their place.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.640
Now you're playing us!

03:41.720 --> 03:42.960
Fun, huh?

03:43.040 --> 03:48.600
We get a rematch, teach you a lesson
and this time, we got the bots to do it.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.480
Slicer!

03:54.200 --> 03:55.400
The Slice-maker!

03:57.320 --> 03:58.520
Thrasher!

03:59.360 --> 04:02.920
The Thrasher-basher!

04:04.840 --> 04:06.080
Crusher!

04:06.160 --> 04:08.480
The Crush-and-mush!

04:09.680 --> 04:10.760
[gasping]

04:11.360 --> 04:12.240
[groans]

04:12.880 --> 04:15.440
See you on the playing field.

04:20.160 --> 04:24.560
[frustrated grunt] All our practising
and planning's been for the wrong team!

04:24.640 --> 04:27.200
And if we lose this game,
we don't get a sponsor.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.480
And without the extra money
a sponsor brings,

04:29.560 --> 04:31.040
we can't afford all this.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.920
We can't afford to play Robozuna.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.720
On the plus side, we saw their bots.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.000
We just need a new strategy.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.080
On the minus side,
we need more than a new strategy.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.080
We need a new shoulder joint for Mangle.
The old one, missing.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.280
Shoulder joint, souvenir?

04:53.360 --> 04:55.160
Nah. Trash.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.600
[grunts]

04:56.680 --> 04:58.080
[cackles]

05:00.040 --> 05:03.000
Official Corvus business. Stand down.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.280
Nyah!

05:13.000 --> 05:13.920
[gasps]

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
[both sigh]

05:16.320 --> 05:17.800
Our secret weapon.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.760
[computer] <i>Reprogramming initiated.</i>

05:22.840 --> 05:25.640
You know,
when we don't play fair like this,

05:25.720 --> 05:27.920
sometimes, it makes me wonder...

05:28.000 --> 05:29.760
Makes you wonder what?

05:29.840 --> 05:33.000
Makes me wonder
why we don't do it more often!

05:33.720 --> 05:35.480
[computer] <i>Reprogramming completed.</i>

05:35.560 --> 05:37.920
[guffaws]

05:40.040 --> 05:44.160
[sighs] Sorry, sold
the last shoulder joint just moments ago.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.960
Oh, wait! Might have something.

05:48.040 --> 05:52.000
Let's have a look. No... Maybe. Ah!

05:54.000 --> 05:54.840
Glue?

05:54.920 --> 05:58.360
Special stuff, super-adhesive and elastic.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.240
Coat the joint with it,
set the shoulder immediately

06:01.320 --> 06:04.320
and then rotate the joint continuously
for, er, half an hour.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.360
That might get you
through a round or two.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.760
-Thanks!
-Love you, Rafie!

06:09.240 --> 06:11.040
Mangle love, too.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.200
It's super-expensive, too!
I'll... I'll put it on your tab.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.880
Well, Spanner,
it's only the middle of round one

06:22.960 --> 06:25.160
and Team Natrix looks fired up

06:25.240 --> 06:28.680
to avenge that last upsetting loss
to Team Veredus.

06:28.760 --> 06:32.120
Right you are, Slick!
They want this one bad!

06:32.200 --> 06:35.440
But they'd better watch out
for Sutrium Arena's obstacles,

06:35.520 --> 06:38.840
like the Pit of Peril
that randomly opens up,

06:38.920 --> 06:42.040
filled with spinning,
razor-sharp metal shredders.

06:42.120 --> 06:47.200
Or the Doom Disk that can randomly fly
out of nowhere, choppin' a bot in half!

06:47.280 --> 06:49.120
-Boom!
-Argh!

06:49.200 --> 06:50.960
Oh-oh-oh! Will you look at that?

06:51.040 --> 06:54.400
Clunk has the thudball
and looks like he's about to score!

07:00.680 --> 07:04.480
Oh! Poor Clunk,
every time he gets the ball, wham!

07:04.560 --> 07:07.120
Thrasher smacks it loose
with that monster mallet.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.600
[grunts] Rafie said rotate it this way!

07:10.680 --> 07:13.800
He didn't say which way,
but it's not that way.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.200
It's this way!

07:15.280 --> 07:17.320
Thrasher want thudball.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.760
Yeah, don't think you need a special
crystal in your head to know that.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.000
Now, hold on.
Need to rotate your arm and...

07:24.400 --> 07:27.200
Clunk should give Thrasher thudball!

07:27.680 --> 07:29.600
That's it! Mangle's right!

07:29.680 --> 07:32.840
We know that Thrasher can hit.
Let's see if he can catch.

07:32.920 --> 07:37.120
Clunk! Give Thrasher the ball,
hard and fast!

07:37.200 --> 07:40.520
Gotcha! Rerouting extra power
to Clunk's throwing arm.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.640
Thrasher-basher!

07:56.040 --> 07:59.200
Clunk, Mangle, teamwork.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.040
-Yeah, yeah.
-We get it.

08:01.120 --> 08:05.680
[Slick] Clunk has the thudball again,
and this time, there's no way to stop him!

08:05.760 --> 08:08.720
[chuckles] We'll see about that.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.720
[blades whirring]

08:12.800 --> 08:14.240
[gasps]

08:18.640 --> 08:20.000
Uh-oh!

08:20.080 --> 08:23.640
[crowd] Clunk! Clunk! Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!

08:26.240 --> 08:27.840
[cheering]

08:27.920 --> 08:29.160
[grunts]

08:29.720 --> 08:30.600
[grunts]

08:30.680 --> 08:34.480
Unbelievable! Clunk scores!

08:34.560 --> 08:37.480
-Team Veredus wins round one!
-Nice timing.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.240
Ha-ha! Way to go, Clunk!
Knew you could do it!

08:44.440 --> 08:48.040
Hm. Teamwork not so good.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.480
[Slick] So far in round two,
neither team's given an inch.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.960
But Mangle looks to have
the upper hand right now.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.680
Mangle take ball.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.320
Huh?

09:09.040 --> 09:10.120
Oh.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.000
[cheering]

09:16.840 --> 09:18.440
The Slice-maker!

09:20.880 --> 09:24.440
You said Rafie told you
30 minutes' continuous rotation?

09:25.040 --> 09:28.480
Uh-huh. Well, we did, sort of...

09:29.000 --> 09:31.640
Yeah! Okay, okay, we messed up.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.120
Mangle not give up.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.600
Mangle stop Slicer.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.400
Mangle... [groans]

09:44.480 --> 09:45.320
[cheering]

09:48.600 --> 09:51.320
[electronic gibbering]

09:52.600 --> 09:57.800
[Slick] <i>Slicer scores</i>
<i>and this Robozuna game is all tied up,</i>

09:57.880 --> 10:00.600
<i>all thanks to a random flying Doom Disk!</i>

10:00.680 --> 10:03.720
Random? Give a girl some credit.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.800
Lucky break for Natrix.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.640
Yeah, lucky break.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.640
It's nothing to do with luck.
We had our chance. We had Slicer down.

10:11.720 --> 10:16.280
And we could have had the ball, too,
if you two... oh, I don't know,

10:16.360 --> 10:20.400
instead of trying to prove who was right,
maybe do what you were supposed to do:

10:20.480 --> 10:21.840
repair Mangle.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.600
[electronic gibbering]

10:24.680 --> 10:26.880
You're right. We messed up.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.280
[both] Sorry, Mangle.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.200
But hey, game's not over!

10:30.280 --> 10:32.080
Yeah, still have a chance!

10:34.000 --> 10:35.480
Hey, Danuve!

10:35.560 --> 10:39.360
Uh, I mean, Aunt Danuvia.
[nervous chuckle]

10:39.440 --> 10:42.800
Uh, nice job, huh? Game's all tied up.

10:43.320 --> 10:47.720
Because you lost the first round!
Doesn't matter.

10:47.800 --> 10:51.920
Like I told you,
I have a little surprise for Team Veredus.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.280
Here! You'll need this.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.720
[Slick]
<i>And taking the field for Team Veredus,</i>

10:58.800 --> 11:02.120

11:02.200 --> 11:04.560

11:15.840 --> 11:18.240
Uh, I don't see a player.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.880
Looks like Team Natrix
is making a surprise substitution.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.360
Oh! They are, indeed!

Are you going to beat this Mega-Batabot,
or what?

12:11.320 --> 12:13.880
Yeah, sure, Ms Neern. Not a problem!

Mega-Batabot. Mega-rampage!

13:51.640 --> 13:56.800
[roars and grunts]

13:57.960 --> 14:01.760
Whoa! And time out's been called
by Team Natrix!

14:02.240 --> 14:05.040
No doubt to corral
their rogue Mega-Batabot

14:05.120 --> 14:07.160
for the safety of the community.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.240
Not quite, Slick.

14:08.320 --> 14:11.240
They're using the time out
to make another substitution.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.800
Now it's going to be Combatabot Crusher,

14:13.880 --> 14:16.920
taking the field
to finish off round three!

14:17.000 --> 14:20.040
The Marketplace!
It's right in Mega-Batabot's path!

14:20.120 --> 14:22.320
We're going to need the whole team!
Grab Spark.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.320
We're forfeiting?
I thought that was forbidden.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.600
Not forfeiting.
Spark, give Scramble the thudball!

14:29.160 --> 14:30.440
Huh, no worries.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.680
Oh, yeah! You'll need this.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.040
[electronic gibbering]

14:41.240 --> 14:43.880
But if we lose, that'll mean no sponsor.

14:43.960 --> 14:47.320
No more Robozuna!
Really think Scramble has a shot?

14:47.400 --> 14:50.520
No, but sometimes
you got to make choices.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.320
Come on, Chike, let's go!

14:53.400 --> 14:55.480
We've got a Mega-Batabot to stop!

14:55.840 --> 14:57.760
Right. Lead the way.

14:58.320 --> 15:02.720
[Slick] And it looks like Team Veredus
has countered with their own substitution.

15:02.800 --> 15:07.120
Scramble! Wait, Scramble? The crashbot?

15:08.160 --> 15:10.400
Game back on!

15:11.640 --> 15:13.840
The Crush-and-mush!

15:15.640 --> 15:17.640
[electronic gibbering]

15:20.800 --> 15:21.640
[burps]

15:21.720 --> 15:23.960
[electronic whimpering]

15:25.040 --> 15:28.480
[growls] Mega-Batabot!

15:29.080 --> 15:33.560
[grunts and growls]

15:39.840 --> 15:42.760
Mega-rampage! [grunts]

15:46.640 --> 15:48.200
[grunts]

15:48.280 --> 15:51.280
Mega-charge! [grunts]

15:52.880 --> 15:54.880
-Run!
-Out of my way!

15:54.960 --> 15:57.280
-[man] Help!
-[woman] Run!

15:57.360 --> 15:59.360
Mega-Batabot trouble.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.160
Mega-trouble!

16:01.640 --> 16:04.000
Mangle's right
and there's no playbook for this.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.640
We'll evacuate the crowd.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.160
Clunk, Mangle, slow Mega-Batabot down
until we can lend you a hand.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.320
Hm. Hm.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.880
Well, you know what I mean.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.840
[electronic squealing]

16:16.920 --> 16:19.280
Why isn't Crusher going for the score?

16:19.560 --> 16:21.160
What's your hurry? [chuckles]

16:21.240 --> 16:25.200
This is fun.
The fans love this kind of stuff!

16:25.280 --> 16:26.920
[screaming and gasping]

16:33.160 --> 16:35.800
[screaming]

16:43.160 --> 16:46.120
[grunts and gasps]

16:47.800 --> 16:50.760
Spark! The taser-jab!

16:50.840 --> 16:52.720
[gasps and pants]

16:52.800 --> 16:54.800
Don't worry. You're safe with us.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.240
Ariston, what now?

16:56.320 --> 16:58.680
-Let's get her over here.
-I'm with you.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.960
Oh thank you. Thank you. [pants]

17:01.040 --> 17:04.000
Oh, you two are part of Team Veredus.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.440
That's right.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.440
[gasping]

17:12.960 --> 17:15.080
[growls]

17:15.920 --> 17:18.120
Mega-charge! [grunts]

17:18.200 --> 17:19.680
Quick! Over here!

17:25.480 --> 17:28.920
Spark, no! Not your taser-fists.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.800
Chike's right!
They'll only make things worse!

17:34.480 --> 17:38.080
[growls and grunts]

17:43.400 --> 17:46.040
[grunts angrily]

17:46.600 --> 17:48.800
Mega-charge!

17:48.880 --> 17:50.360
[yells]

17:59.120 --> 18:00.040
[grunts]

18:04.200 --> 18:07.200
[screaming]

18:11.480 --> 18:14.320
[grunts] Mega-charge! Mega-charge!

18:14.400 --> 18:17.760
Looks like Mega-Batabot's
getting a little over-charged.

18:17.840 --> 18:22.240
That's it! Spark's zaps
overloads Mega-Batabot's circuits.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.720
Game over.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.720
Right. Boosting taser fists
to full power... to the max!

18:27.800 --> 18:30.680
[zooming and crackling]

18:35.440 --> 18:38.000
[gibbers and growls]

18:38.080 --> 18:39.680
[grunts]

18:39.760 --> 18:42.120
[gibbers and grunts]

18:42.200 --> 18:44.560
-Agh!
-[chuckles]

18:44.640 --> 18:46.120
[roars]

18:46.880 --> 18:47.920
[groans and cackles]

18:48.000 --> 18:49.360
Yes! It's working!

18:49.440 --> 18:50.600
Yeah.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.680
-Oh, yeah.
-[grunting]

18:55.240 --> 18:58.000
Almost worked
but can't risk getting that close again.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.320
Mangle have plan.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.000
Teamwork.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.160
[grunting]

19:25.400 --> 19:26.240
[growls]

19:31.000 --> 19:34.280
[Mega-Batabot grunts and mumbles]

19:34.360 --> 19:36.240
Mangle taser-jab!

19:36.800 --> 19:39.960
[grunts and groans]

19:40.920 --> 19:42.280
Game over.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.920
-[electronic gibbering]
-[cheering]

19:47.000 --> 19:48.440
[Zeve chuckles]

19:48.720 --> 19:50.120
-Zeve!
-Huh?

19:51.600 --> 19:56.120
Oh! Crusher, get off your butt and score!

19:56.200 --> 19:57.480
[electronic grunting]

20:00.600 --> 20:05.440
[electronic squealing]

20:05.960 --> 20:06.800
[grunts]

20:07.360 --> 20:13.720
[Slick] <i>Oh! Crusher crushes it,</i>
<i>scoring to win the round and the game!</i>

20:14.640 --> 20:18.400
-[electronic sobbing]
-[crowd chant] Team Veredus! Team Veredus!

20:18.480 --> 20:19.680
-Oh, right!
-Yes!

20:19.760 --> 20:23.200
[Slick]
<i>And just listen to that crowd cheer.</i>

20:23.280 --> 20:27.000
<i>Only they're not cheering for Team Natrix,</i>
<i>they're cheering for...</i>

20:27.080 --> 20:29.080
-Yeah!
-Team Veredus!

20:29.400 --> 20:34.640
[Slick] <i>Team Veredus,</i>
<i>today's true Robozuna heroes!</i>

20:34.720 --> 20:39.040
[crowd] Team Veredus! Team Veredus!

20:39.560 --> 20:41.920
-Lanista.
-Evete.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.960
I know, I know, we had a deal.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.760
We don't win, you don't sponsor.
I understand.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.480
-Really, darling, I don't think you do.
-Hm?

20:49.560 --> 20:52.000
These three just saved my life.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.960
And, oh, my, will you just listen
to that marvellous crowd?

20:57.360 --> 20:59.720
They love, love you.

20:59.800 --> 21:04.280
Who cares if you didn't win the game?
You've won over the fans!

21:04.360 --> 21:07.280
Congratulation, Team Veredus.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.600
You now have a sponsor!

21:10.960 --> 21:13.320
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

21:20.560 --> 21:22.640
[comms bleep]

21:22.720 --> 21:26.640
Dr Naron, I do hope this is good news.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.320
[Dr Naron] <i>It is.</i>

21:28.400 --> 21:33.680
<i>My fellow researchers at the Facility</i>

21:33.760 --> 21:35.760
Oh, good.
