01:20.540 --> 01:22.629
-She stopped breathing.

01:22.838 --> 01:24.132
Any medication?

01:24.570 --> 01:27.294

-No. Nothing!

01:33.262 --> 01:35.226

04:58.438 --> 05:00.130
Hey, Timmy. What's up?

05:17.487 --> 05:19.781
You know, l really need
a cup of coffee.

05:19.984 --> 05:21.710
Cream, no sugar.

05:22.349 --> 05:23.745
Thank you.

05:30.175 --> 05:32.730
-Wanna help with a chest pain?
-Yes.

05:35.304 --> 05:36.360
Be right back.

05:37.235 --> 05:39.994
Mr. Zambano, l'm Dr. Lewis.
This is John Carter.

05:40.199 --> 05:43.684
ln order to evaluate pain,
start with P.Q.R.S.T.

05:44.328 --> 05:45.486
So start.

05:45.694 --> 05:47.749
Great. Provoking/palliating, right?

05:48.192 --> 05:49.816
What brought on your pain?

05:50.023 --> 05:51.487
lt started in the shower.

05:51.922 --> 05:53.318
Could you describe it?

05:53.519 --> 05:55.541
lt's like somebody's
squeezing my chest.

05:56.084 --> 05:57.446
Right.

05:58.215 --> 05:59.646
Well, good.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.968
Radiation.

06:02.778 --> 06:04.833
Does the pain move anywhere?
Neck, back?

06:05.042 --> 06:06.700
No. What is he, a beginner?

06:07.474 --> 06:09.438
This is a teaching hospital,
Mr. Zambano.

06:12.701 --> 06:15.823
Your EKG's normal,
and your history of angina...

06:16.032 --> 06:18.121
...l don't think we need
to be concerned.

06:18.330 --> 06:22.724
Dr. Carter will keep an eye on you
while we wait for the enzyme results.

06:31.884 --> 06:33.439
lt's been eight weeks.

06:33.649 --> 06:36.112
You mean you haven't
even been out there yet?

06:36.313 --> 06:40.866
-Thought about it, just haven't done it.
-You and Hathaway were so close.

06:44.305 --> 06:46.633
lt's not gonna get any easier, Doug.

06:47.935 --> 06:49.490
Just go!

07:06.319 --> 07:07.477

07:27.200 --> 07:30.027

She's got a scalp laceration
and a deformed humerus fracture.

07:55.207 --> 07:58.136
Let's get her downstairs right away.
All right?

08:00.436 --> 08:01.423
Take her into 2.

08:01.634 --> 08:04.064
Doug, take the little girl into 1 .

08:06.896 --> 08:08.724
Mommy!

08:10.693 --> 08:12.748

08:28.475 --> 08:31.563

08:31.773 --> 08:34.101
-Who else is on the floor?
-Everybody's working.

08:34.304 --> 08:37.131
Call the O.R. and let's
see who they can spare.

Concentrate, all right?

08:53.020 --> 08:54.712
-You hear me?
-Mommy!

08:54.917 --> 08:57.779
Okay, you hear me?
Tell me where it hurts.

08:57.981 --> 08:59.969
Does it hurt here? How about here?

09:00.979 --> 09:03.670
-Spleen.
-We gotta get her to the O.R., now!

09:04.342 --> 09:06.636

09:27.054 --> 09:29.916

09:30.118 --> 09:32.605
Let's get a tox screen

09:32.816 --> 09:35.076
We have to rule out head trauma.

09:37.246 --> 09:39.937
-Has he done this before?
-Five times.

09:44.938 --> 09:49.196

09:50.966 --> 09:53.055
We're working on them right now.

09:53.264 --> 09:54.455
l didn't even see him.

09:54.662 --> 09:58.023
The light changed, Janet screamed,
and there he was.

09:58.858 --> 10:01.015
We're working on your family.

10:08.616 --> 10:10.910
-How many more do we have?
-Three.

10:11.380 --> 10:15.433
Three. l have to check on

10:30.362 --> 10:32.622
How much longer am l gonna
have to wait?

10:32.826 --> 10:35.813
Just a couple more minutes.
We are very busy today.

10:36.024 --> 10:38.284
But you're feeling all right
otherwise?

10:38.821 --> 10:39.911
Mr. Zambano?

10:41.785 --> 10:42.772
Mr. Zambano?

10:57.437 --> 10:59.230

-Sorry.

11:29.708 --> 11:32.569
-You need help?
-l'm here.

11:34.036 --> 11:39.055
-Vital signs stable?
-Yes. Sir, you're gonna be just fine.

the hospital to make you better.

11:54.085 --> 11:56.640
-Where's Mommy?
-We're taking care of her too.

11:56.849 --> 11:59.369
And your daddy will be there
when you wake up.

12:00.978 --> 12:02.602
Here you go, Doug.

12:06.307 --> 12:09.327
-She gonna make it?
-Ruptured spleen. How's the father?

12:09.537 --> 12:10.899
Orthopods are doing his leg.

12:11.103 --> 12:14.328
The driver's sleeping like a baby.
Not a scratch on him.

12:17.729 --> 12:19.159
How's the mother?

12:19.361 --> 12:20.655
Maybe.

12:33.315 --> 12:35.870
lt's 8 weeks since she
attempted suicide.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.102
You two were close.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.740
You and Hathaway shared
a lot of things.

12:40.941 --> 12:43.167
l stopped by. A couple of times.

12:44.238 --> 12:46.202
Never got out of the car.

12:47.635 --> 12:50.463
Take her some flowers.
You don't have to stay long.

12:55.728 --> 12:57.624
You want me to go with you?

12:57.826 --> 12:59.085

13:09.314 --> 13:10.574
lt's me.

13:11.846 --> 13:13.867
lt's not your fault, Doug.

13:14.077 --> 13:16.098
You gotta forgive yourself
sooner or later.

13:32.826 --> 13:36.153
Pop! Pop! Just like that,
he shoot me. For cigarettes!

13:36.356 --> 13:37.980
Give him a gram of ancef lV.

13:38.188 --> 13:41.810
No older than my grandson.
Twelve, maybe. With a little gun.

13:42.018 --> 13:43.642
CBC chest and shoulder films.

13:43.850 --> 13:45.337
Little man. Little gun.

13:45.548 --> 13:48.534
Fifteen years l am selling liquor
out of the same store.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.368
Robbed seven times,
never hurt. Nothing!

13:52.142 --> 13:55.196
Now l get shot by sixth grader

Patient in 2

13:57.204 --> 13:59.997
...and one in Trauma with
a stab wound.

14:00.201 --> 14:01.461
Mr. Gregor, you're lucky.

14:01.933 --> 14:03.760
The bullet went straight through.

14:03.964 --> 14:05.724
l'm gonna send you up to O.R.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.052
They'll explore the wound for
serious damage...

14:08.260 --> 14:10.450
...remove any dead tissue
and debris.

14:10.658 --> 14:12.679
Work up the patient in 2,

-Cigars, then?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.023
Good doctor, eh?

14:38.333 --> 14:39.854
He's the best.

He has a low-grade fever,
slight cough...

14:42.495 --> 14:45.458

-Victor, lie still.

14:57.315 --> 14:58.507
Why don't you lie back?

14:58.713 --> 15:00.575

16:19.471 --> 16:20.595
Cap refill is normal.

16:20.804 --> 16:22.700
My leg is fine, my stomach hurts.

16:23.335 --> 16:24.697
Dr. Carter, what would you do?

16:27.031 --> 16:30.188
With his history of constipation
and the type of pain...

16:30.394 --> 16:32.052
...l'd order a CBC...

16:32.260 --> 16:34.689
...Chem-7, UA amylase
and a KUB.

16:35.756 --> 16:39.515
-lf they're normal?
-l'd discharge him. Let him see his physician.

16:40.519 --> 16:41.506
Congratulations.

16:42.184 --> 16:45.170
You just cost this hospital
a $2-million settlement.

16:47.912 --> 16:50.602
You could have a thrombosis
with extension...

16:50.809 --> 16:52.569
...into the mesenteric arteries.

16:52.774 --> 16:53.932
What's a thrombosis?

16:54.140 --> 16:57.829
lt's a blood clot.
They replaced an artery in your leg.

16:58.036 --> 17:01.987
Sometimes a clot forms in the artery.
l'd like to rule it out.

17:02.731 --> 17:03.889
Get him an arteriogram.

17:04.096 --> 17:05.356
Can't we wait for my doctor?

17:05.563 --> 17:07.027
l don't think that'd be wise.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.917
Notify Radiology and get them
on it right away.

17:14.453 --> 17:16.145
Thrombosis.

17:20.382 --> 17:24.276
The mother's still in surgery.
The blood alcohol came back at .435

17:24.478 --> 17:25.999
What about the drug screen?

17:26.210 --> 17:27.606
lt was negative.

17:28.707 --> 17:30.399
There's no justice, is there?

17:30.605 --> 17:32.194
Not much.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.020
He's dehydrated and has a slight
respiratory infection.

17:45.225 --> 17:47.780
He's still confused and agitated.

17:50.154 --> 17:52.516
Sir, sir.
l have two dogs and--

17:52.719 --> 17:55.205
Two? That's great, sir.

17:55.816 --> 18:00.005
-Did you run a CAT scan?
-Diffuse atrophy. Nothing new or focal.

18:00.878 --> 18:02.365
l'm out of here.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.061
-That's it?
-What were you expecting?

18:07.271 --> 18:09.633
l thought he'd be admitted to
Psych Services.

18:09.835 --> 18:11.130
But he's got an infection.

18:11.335 --> 18:14.025
He's senile and he needs
psych support.

18:14.232 --> 18:16.821
So now you're a psychiatrist?

18:17.029 --> 18:19.821
l can recognize senile dementia
when l see it.

18:20.093 --> 18:22.114
He's not medically
cleared to my service.

18:22.324 --> 18:24.913
He has a respiratory
infection and he's dehydrated.

18:25.122 --> 18:28.051
What he needs is antibiotics
and lV hydration.

18:28.252 --> 18:31.737
l'll buff him up, start
the antibiotics and pull the lV.

18:31.949 --> 18:35.571
Give him 2.5 Haldol and have Social
Services do a follow-up.

18:35.778 --> 18:37.572
l don't have a bed for him.

18:37.777 --> 18:39.570
He needs our help.

18:40.474 --> 18:42.734
You want me turning away
homicidal psychotics...

18:42.939 --> 18:45.402
...because your patient's got
one of my beds?

18:46.135 --> 18:50.121
Find him a medical bed
or release him. l'm not admitting him.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.185
End of discussion.

18:58.690 --> 18:59.746
You fell asleep?

18:59.956 --> 19:01.852
Oak Street Beach.

19:02.054 --> 19:04.812
You fell asleep in the sun?

19:06.383 --> 19:07.780
Can you sit down?

19:09.747 --> 19:10.905
l don't think so.

19:12.311 --> 19:14.831
Maybe we should lean
him against the gurney.

19:17.107 --> 19:18.230
l passed.

19:18.739 --> 19:19.726
The bar?

19:28.263 --> 19:29.784
l am so proud of you!

19:29.995 --> 19:31.153
This is heartwarming...

19:31.360 --> 19:33.324
...but can l get some help here?

19:35.489 --> 19:37.646
-Can you take vital signs?
-Sure thing.

19:49.576 --> 19:51.540
Congratulations.

19:54.638 --> 19:55.625
What are you doing?

19:55.837 --> 19:59.357
Remember the back seat
of your Celica?

19:59.567 --> 20:01.531
Remember the trip to Hawaii?

20:06.827 --> 20:09.847
You gotta get accepted
to the bar more often.

20:13.655 --> 20:16.311
Timmy, where's the car accident?

20:31.271 --> 20:32.894
Hi, Mr. Ring.

20:33.402 --> 20:34.765
l'm Dr. Benton.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.664
ls my daughter out of surgery?

20:36.866 --> 20:39.557
Not yet, but don't worry.
She's gonna be okay.

20:39.763 --> 20:41.818
We had to repair her spleen.

20:43.259 --> 20:45.348
l need to talk to you
about your wife.

20:46.024 --> 20:49.975
She's got a spinal fracture and
massive internal bleeding.

20:50.187 --> 20:51.947
She has what's called DlC.

20:52.151 --> 20:55.013
Her blood won't clot
as a result of the trauma.

20:55.215 --> 20:57.441
She's going to die.

20:57.647 --> 21:00.337
Mr. Ring...

21:00.544 --> 21:03.938
...did you and your wife ever
discuss organ donation?

21:39.474 --> 21:40.564
He needs to be admitted.

21:40.773 --> 21:43.135
-On what grounds?
-Change of mental status.

21:43.337 --> 21:44.802
He's senile, that's nothing new.

21:45.002 --> 21:46.899
Give him antibiotics, send him home.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.620
He has no one
to make sure he takes his meds...

21:49.831 --> 21:51.386
...to feed him, use the bathroom--

21:51.597 --> 21:53.322
That's what Social Services are for.

21:53.528 --> 21:55.855
-They can't see him today.
-What about Psych?

21:56.059 --> 21:58.454
Cvetic won't admit him.

21:58.657 --> 22:01.086
He can be treated as an outpatient.

22:01.288 --> 22:03.275
We don't have the beds.

22:03.486 --> 22:06.574
lf Cvetic won't take him, he's out.
Thank you, Timmy.

22:12.876 --> 22:15.272
Emergency alarm's going off.

22:15.908 --> 22:19.234
Malik, grab the crash cart.
Susan, we got a mayday.

22:38.785 --> 22:40.908
l can't find my earring.

22:57.236 --> 23:00.824
Your hand was on the emergency call
button the entire time?

23:00.999 --> 23:01.986
Oh, man.

23:03.064 --> 23:04.619
l miss all the good stuff.

23:04.828 --> 23:06.292
l'm never gonna live this down.

23:06.494 --> 23:10.014
This is great. Everybody thought you
were some kind of a saint.

23:10.224 --> 23:12.051
l was gonna call you ''Mahatma.''

23:12.255 --> 23:14.116
What'll happen when Wertz hears?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.749
You were with your wife.
Lucky you.

23:18.216 --> 23:21.304
l'm chief resident. l'm supposed
to set a good example.

23:21.513 --> 23:24.601
lt's a big hospital. Maybe Wertz
won't even hear about it.

23:24.810 --> 23:27.433
Hey, Mark.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.660
How's it hanging?

23:30.871 --> 23:32.426
l'm a dead man.

23:37.299 --> 23:38.593
Carter!

23:41.828 --> 23:45.086
Doctor, time to get up.

23:45.790 --> 23:47.085
Clear!

23:51.385 --> 23:53.350
l've got a rash.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.338
l need a doctor.

24:04.906 --> 24:07.234
-Are you a doctor?
-Me?

24:09.835 --> 24:10.992
She's got a rash.

24:12.166 --> 24:15.323
-Can you help me?
-Sure. l can try.

24:17.628 --> 24:19.592
Pressure's 70 over 50.

24:19.793 --> 24:23.187
Pulse is 1 20, resps 32.

24:23.389 --> 24:26.681
Temperature's 1 02.5.
Pulse ox...

24:26.886 --> 24:28.475
...is only 85 percent.

24:33.780 --> 24:35.710
-You her husband?
-Yes.

24:35.877 --> 24:38.500
Mr. Franks, this is Dr. Greene.

24:38.908 --> 24:41.394
What kind of medications is she on?

24:41.605 --> 24:46.000
l tried to get her to see our doctor
for weeks but she wouldn't go.

24:47.100 --> 24:48.587
Lasix, Dig, KCl...

24:48.799 --> 24:52.421
...lsordil, nitro,
captopril, Antivert...

24:52.628 --> 24:54.956
...Darvocet, Timaptic.

24:55.892 --> 24:58.583
We need a chest film,
EKG, CBC...

24:58.789 --> 25:01.185
...Chem-7, Dig level, UA...

25:01.387 --> 25:04.283
...blood cultures times two,
blood gases...

25:04.484 --> 25:07.380
...and hydrate her with a
300cc bolus of saline.

25:09.946 --> 25:11.410
ls she gonna be all right?

25:14.408 --> 25:19.098
We may have to make a difficult
choice in the next few hours.

25:19.304 --> 25:21.893
We're dealing with impending
respiratory failure.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.487
Please do everything you can.

25:28.096 --> 25:31.922
We'll get blood gases first and
then take it from there, okay?

25:32.125 --> 25:33.419
Okay.

25:51.606 --> 25:55.228
So you're in your third year
of medical school.

25:55.836 --> 25:57.062
Must be hard.

25:57.568 --> 25:58.896
lt's pretty demanding.

26:00.432 --> 26:02.589
Must be very...

26:03.196 --> 26:04.252
...hard.

26:04.462 --> 26:06.925
Afternoon, Dr. Carter.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.283
Hi, Dr. Lewis.

26:08.491 --> 26:10.716
Poison ivy. Pretty nasty case.

26:10.922 --> 26:13.784
Saw lots of this when
l did my Dermatology rotation.

26:13.986 --> 26:16.575
You don't mind if l observe,
do you, doctor?

26:16.784 --> 26:18.442
He's doing fine on his own.

26:18.648 --> 26:20.112
l'm sure he is.

26:20.314 --> 26:23.936
Medrol Dosepak and
antihistamine will clear this right up.

26:28.872 --> 26:33.164
Remember the summer when Jerry
broke his arm up at the lake?

26:34.633 --> 26:36.620
And you were so worried.

26:36.831 --> 26:39.351
l told you that boys will be boys.

26:40.062 --> 26:42.719
But you pampered him.

26:42.925 --> 26:47.081
lt's remarkable he turned out
as well as he did. lsn't it?

26:47.289 --> 26:48.685
Mr. Franks?

26:51.318 --> 26:55.077
l'm troubled with the results
of your wife's blood gases.

26:55.813 --> 26:57.368
How old is she?

26:59.144 --> 27:00.938
Eighty-six.

27:02.074 --> 27:04.039
Our options are limited.

27:05.105 --> 27:07.002
Her condition is terminal.

27:07.702 --> 27:11.495
lf we put her on a respirator,
we may not be able to wean her off.

27:11.699 --> 27:14.719
We'd be prolonging her life
in a vegetative state.

27:15.795 --> 27:18.554
Or we can make her comfortable.

27:18.759 --> 27:22.210
Give her fluids, antibiotics...

27:22.422 --> 27:24.182
...let nature run its course.

27:24.886 --> 27:26.510
You mean let her die.

27:27.784 --> 27:29.180
She'd die in peace.

27:31.081 --> 27:32.943
Put her on the respirator.

27:34.877 --> 27:37.806
Mr. Franks, are you sure
that's what she'd want?

27:42.204 --> 27:44.531
We'll hold off until
we get another blood gas.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.525
Hopefully she'll improve
with nebulizer treatments.

27:55.458 --> 27:58.445
She has 1 3 grandchildren.
Did you know that?

28:02.651 --> 28:04.616
No, sir. l didn't know that.

28:07.215 --> 28:09.270
l just thought you should know.

28:24.065 --> 28:25.495
So you're finally up.

28:25.697 --> 28:27.059
What time is it?

28:27.262 --> 28:28.318
Seven-thirty.

28:29.260 --> 28:31.815
Boy, l must've really
tied one on this time.

28:32.025 --> 28:35.454
-l'll go get you a doctor.
-Thanks.

28:41.649 --> 28:42.636
Damn it!

28:43.314 --> 28:45.743
Did l get busted again?

28:45.945 --> 28:48.602
-You don't remember?
-No, not much.

28:52.472 --> 28:53.562
Am l hurt or something?

28:53.771 --> 28:57.222
The policeman went for coffee.
He'll be right back.

28:57.434 --> 29:00.591
l must've really screwed up
this time, didn't l?

29:02.263 --> 29:03.387
You hit a family.

29:04.128 --> 29:07.887
The mother's dead,
and the daughter's in lntensive Care.

29:13.153 --> 29:14.584
You ordered an angiogram?

29:14.784 --> 29:17.407
They haven't gotten to it.
Radiology's backed up.

29:17.616 --> 29:19.046
Thank God for small favors.

29:19.248 --> 29:20.905
No concern about a thrombosis?

29:21.112 --> 29:23.440
His urine came back positive.

29:23.643 --> 29:26.368
l think his pain is related
to a urinary tract infection.

29:26.573 --> 29:28.696
He had a Foley catheter in surgery.

29:28.905 --> 29:30.835
You don't think it's serious, Joe?

29:31.036 --> 29:33.431
l'll write you a prescription
and send you home.

29:33.634 --> 29:35.825
That's what he said.

29:36.298 --> 29:39.489
Excuse me, doctor. May l have
a word with you, please?

29:42.992 --> 29:45.615
l really think
you might want to reconsider.

29:45.822 --> 29:47.650
What are you, a third-year resident?

29:47.854 --> 29:50.011
Second year. Surgical resident.

29:51.351 --> 29:55.074
The next time you wanna practice
overly aggressive procedures...

29:55.280 --> 29:57.800
...do it on one of your
indigent patients.

29:58.011 --> 30:00.906
They won't know you're
showing off for students.

30:01.874 --> 30:03.600
We'll have you out in five minutes.

30:03.806 --> 30:05.996
Joe, that's great.
Thanks so much.

30:06.204 --> 30:10.859
Right in the middle of the reception
she starts puking her guts out.

30:11.066 --> 30:14.960
Honey, l'm sorry. l just--
Oh, God!

30:15.428 --> 30:16.484
There she goes again.

30:16.694 --> 30:19.782
Compazine, 1 0 milligrams l.M.
CBC and Chem-7.

30:19.990 --> 30:21.046
What did she eat?

30:21.256 --> 30:23.685
l don't think she ate
until the reception.

30:23.887 --> 30:25.317
Did you, honey?

30:25.919 --> 30:27.974
Everybody had the same
buffet at Gerber's.

30:28.184 --> 30:32.078
You're holding your reception at
Gerber's Hofbrau House on 46th?

30:32.280 --> 30:35.072
That's where those German
tourists ate.

30:35.277 --> 30:36.764
How many guests at your wedding?

30:36.975 --> 30:38.768
Couple of hundred.

30:38.973 --> 30:40.494
l'll get more emesis basins.

30:40.704 --> 30:42.895
She's become a little more lucid.

30:43.103 --> 30:45.895
Have her blood gases improved?

30:46.100 --> 30:49.120
PCO-2's up to 70. She's tiring.

30:56.790 --> 30:57.777
She's getting better.

31:01.852 --> 31:04.974
Your wife was dehydrated, Mr. Franks.

31:05.182 --> 31:07.611
She woke because we gave her fluids.

31:07.813 --> 31:10.641
Her respiratory problem is worsening.

31:13.974 --> 31:15.495
l'm very tired.

31:16.971 --> 31:18.129
l know, dear.

31:19.202 --> 31:20.894
Are you in any pain?

31:21.100 --> 31:23.122
l'm dying, aren't l, doctor?

31:23.332 --> 31:25.058
No, you're gonna be fine.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.779
Mrs. Franks.

31:32.989 --> 31:36.612
You are not gonna be able
to continue breathing on your own...

31:36.819 --> 31:38.148
...for very much longer.

31:39.084 --> 31:42.876
Do you want us to put you on
a machine to help you breathe?

31:43.080 --> 31:44.204
Yes. She does.

31:44.412 --> 31:46.569
l'm asking your wife, Mr. Franks.

31:49.907 --> 31:52.632
-For how long?
-l don't know.

31:53.005 --> 31:54.560
We've already discussed this!

32:02.862 --> 32:05.689
l don't want you to go.

32:05.892 --> 32:07.516
Oh, l know.

32:14.884 --> 32:17.313
lt's okay, darling.

32:36.397 --> 32:38.225
A couple of hundred?

32:38.429 --> 32:42.551
But not everybody had the potato
salad. Only about 60 are sick.

32:43.757 --> 32:45.618
Connie! Thank God!

32:45.822 --> 32:49.149
l've never been so glad
to see anybody in my whole life.

32:49.352 --> 32:51.112
Good night, everybody!

32:52.848 --> 32:55.744
Just keep your head down.
We'll be with you soon.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.666
Not everybody gets Compazine.

32:59.876 --> 33:03.327
D5, NS lVs if they look like
they need it, okay?

33:04.039 --> 33:06.230
Yeah, l'm holding.

33:06.436 --> 33:08.025
-What was that?
-Accordions.

33:08.235 --> 33:11.686
Their wedding reception's
in our waiting room. 'Night!

33:12.197 --> 33:13.627
Dr. Lewis.

33:13.863 --> 33:15.191
l need you.

33:18.858 --> 33:22.049
They found him walking down
the middle of Halsted, naked.

33:22.255 --> 33:24.945
He was still wearing
his hospital bracelet.

33:25.152 --> 33:27.775
Hey, Victor.

33:27.983 --> 33:31.037
My dogs. l have to feed my dogs.

33:31.246 --> 33:32.404
l know you do.

33:32.612 --> 33:33.599
Should l get Cvetic?

33:33.777 --> 33:36.899
No. l want you to take him
to Psych Services, now.

33:37.108 --> 33:38.402
What if they won't accept him?

33:38.606 --> 33:40.661
Then l'll sign him
into Cvetic's service.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.085
How you holding up?

33:51.295 --> 33:54.315
l'll make it, l'm off in
three hours. You on tonight?

33:54.524 --> 33:56.318
No. Benton.

33:56.522 --> 33:59.179
Talk to Doug about Hathaway.
lt's been two months.

33:59.387 --> 34:02.146
l did. l even offered
to drive him out there.

34:02.351 --> 34:05.439
Why is he acting like this?
They were together two years.

34:05.648 --> 34:09.132
He feels guilty.
He thinks it's his fault.

34:09.344 --> 34:12.308
l guess things are better
with you and Jennifer, huh?

34:16.172 --> 34:19.623
She passed her bar. She was excited.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.628
So were you, from what l could see.

34:26.761 --> 34:29.315
So what happens next?
She gets a job?

34:29.525 --> 34:30.922
She's looking.

34:34.288 --> 34:36.649
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

34:36.853 --> 34:39.248
Do not admit a patient
to my service without a consult.

34:39.449 --> 34:40.846
He needs psychiatric help.

34:41.049 --> 34:43.478
-Not in my opinion.
-He was found naked on Halsted.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.268
-He's senile, not psychotic!
-He needs care.

34:46.476 --> 34:49.632
-Admit him to your service.
-Wertz wouldn't let me.

34:54.536 --> 34:56.795
Don't ever do that to me again.

35:11.287 --> 35:12.650
Dr. Benton?

35:14.717 --> 35:17.475
l'm sorry about what happened
with the thrombosis patient.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.706
l think you were right.

35:20.945 --> 35:22.636
ls that so?

35:22.876 --> 35:24.431
He should've had the angiogram.

35:25.407 --> 35:27.133
Great.

35:27.338 --> 35:30.563
<i>l'll be sure to notify the
New England Journal of Medicine.</i>

36:25.618 --> 36:26.980
Doug Ross needs you.

36:27.183 --> 36:28.273
What's up?

36:28.482 --> 36:30.310
Mrs. Franks died.

36:40.404 --> 36:44.730
<i>For you're the lover
I've been waiting for</i>

36:46.132 --> 36:48.062
<i>The mate that fate had me...</i>

36:49.229 --> 36:50.659
<i>...created for</i>

36:51.893 --> 36:54.221
<i>And every time your lips...</i>

36:56.355 --> 36:57.411
<i>...meet mine</i>

36:58.986 --> 37:03.846
<i>Darling, down and down I go</i>

37:05.281 --> 37:08.177
<i>Round and round I go</i>

37:09.310 --> 37:10.832
<i>In a spin</i>

37:14.239 --> 37:16.135
<i>Loving the spin I'm in</i>

37:18.536 --> 37:20.227
<i>Under That Old...</i>

37:20.434 --> 37:24.362
<i>...Black Magic...</i>

37:24.563 --> 37:29.184
<i>...called love</i>

38:45.188 --> 38:47.584
-She asleep?
-Finally.

38:49.984 --> 38:52.312
l'm proud of you, counselor.

38:52.514 --> 38:54.535
Never thought l'd make it, huh?

38:56.345 --> 38:58.434
l knew you'd make it.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.765
l miss you.

39:06.435 --> 39:08.263
l miss you too.

39:11.364 --> 39:13.260
We have to make love more often.

39:17.824 --> 39:20.118
The look on your face!

39:20.323 --> 39:22.310
lt was a little embarrassing.

39:29.414 --> 39:32.173
We could pick up where we left off.

39:32.377 --> 39:34.342
What if Rachel wakes up?

39:35.275 --> 39:36.705
We could stay out here.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.030
ln the yard?

39:39.171 --> 39:41.068
lf Mrs. Navrocki sees us?

39:41.269 --> 39:43.563
What if she did, huh?

39:47.530 --> 39:50.891
l have to be back in the hospital
in two hours, Jen.

39:56.589 --> 39:58.212
l'm sorry.

40:10.142 --> 40:12.299
You're never gonna leave, are you?

40:18.168 --> 40:19.689
The hospital.

40:29.857 --> 40:31.549
l don't know.

40:35.486 --> 40:37.382
l need you, Mark.

40:45.244 --> 40:46.640
l love you.

41:39.227 --> 41:41.054
-How did you get--
-Let's go.

41:41.258 --> 41:43.154
-Where?
-Your place.

41:44.222 --> 41:45.312
l live with my folks.

41:46.020 --> 41:47.485
My place, then.

42:09.299 --> 42:12.728
What are we there for, if we
can't keep a 75-year-old man...

42:12.928 --> 42:16.017
...from wandering around
the North Side naked?

42:17.857 --> 42:21.479
l just get so frustrated sometimes,
you know. l just...

42:22.353 --> 42:24.113
...wanna scream.

42:27.115 --> 42:29.578
You can't solve all
the world's problems.

42:29.780 --> 42:32.675
That's what Wertz said.

42:32.877 --> 42:35.670
Well, he's very wise.

42:35.874 --> 42:40.427
Listen, you have to be very careful
how you deal with consults.

42:41.136 --> 42:43.191
You can get yourself in real trouble.

42:43.401 --> 42:45.591
l just wanna make a difference.

42:47.130 --> 42:50.560
Yeah, well, you also wanna
have a career.

42:50.760 --> 42:54.780
And not everybody's gonna be as
understanding as l was.

42:55.589 --> 42:58.780
Yeah, you're real understanding.

42:58.986 --> 43:01.472
That's one of my best qualities.

43:01.683 --> 43:04.170
Well, one of them.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.195
Hello, Helen.

43:52.903 --> 43:53.925
Can l come in?

43:54.867 --> 43:56.831
No, you can't.

43:57.098 --> 43:59.187
Go away. Please.

44:00.295 --> 44:01.590
Who is it, Mama?

44:02.061 --> 44:03.922
l asked him to leave.

44:04.225 --> 44:06.121
lt's okay, Mama.

44:25.605 --> 44:27.160
You look beautiful.

44:38.160 --> 44:39.557
How've you been?

44:40.724 --> 44:42.087
Okay.

44:44.288 --> 44:46.775
l just came by to see you.

44:46.985 --> 44:48.745
Say hi.

44:50.216 --> 44:52.180
lt's good to see you.

44:58.042 --> 44:59.166
Take care.

45:27.947 --> 45:29.242
Dr. Benton?

45:29.878 --> 45:31.843
-What is it?
-EMTs are on their way.

45:32.043 --> 45:34.371
They think it's a ruptured bowel.

45:37.305 --> 45:38.292
What's the pulse?

45:38.504 --> 45:41.467
Pulse is 1 40. Pressure 60 over 40.

45:41.801 --> 45:44.731
We've been pumping in fluids.
He's had 1 500cc's.

45:44.931 --> 45:46.828
Abdomen's rigid, extremely tender.

45:47.029 --> 45:49.152
Says he was here today
with a thrombosis.

45:49.361 --> 45:51.416
Let's get a CBC.
Type and cross six units.

45:51.625 --> 45:56.315
Let's drop an NG. Call the O.R., tell
them to prep for an exploratory lap.

45:56.521 --> 45:59.178
All right, people, come on!
We've done this before.

45:59.384 --> 46:01.848
Camacho, l got him.
Let's get him in close.

46:02.049 --> 46:04.445
Listen, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

46:04.646 --> 46:06.043
All right, we've done it before.

46:06.245 --> 46:10.174
Here we go.
One, two, three! Let's go!

46:10.608 --> 46:13.197
All right, clear.
Let's move, people!

46:13.405 --> 46:14.734
Here we go.

46:14.937 --> 46:18.593
All right, l need to drop an NG.
Let's get a chest x-ray...

46:18.800 --> 46:21.786
...and abdominal.
Make it a portable. Let's move!
