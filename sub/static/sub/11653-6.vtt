AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.672 --> 00:09.344
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.427 --> 00:12.722
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.223 --> 00:18.561
But a foolish Samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword

00:18.645 --> 00:21.523
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:24.526 --> 00:26.611
Before the final blow was struck,

00:26.694 --> 00:29.322
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.405 --> 00:31.241
and flung him into the future,

00:31.324 --> 00:33.743
where my evil is law.

00:34.244 --> 00:38.206
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.331 --> 00:42.835
and undo the future that is Aku.

I have come for--

02:51.172 --> 02:53.549
Please, please, do not insult me.

02:53.633 --> 02:55.426
I know why you are here.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.345
- You do?
- Of course.

02:58.304 --> 03:01.766
Many things in life are a mystery,
but I know why you are here.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.644
Yes. I know like a mother knows its child.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.772
For example,
if the child came home crying,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.691
the mother would know why.

You are here for what you cannot
find anywhere else.

03:20.702 --> 03:23.705
You are here to fulfill
your most intimate desire.

- What?
- Yes.

03:38.594 --> 03:39.595

03:39.679 --> 03:41.139
It is quite breathtaking.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.391

I must have the wrong place.

I do not wish to purchase a rug.

03:45.101 --> 03:46.102

10:45.729 --> 10:48.524
my father, a great warrior,

10:48.983 --> 10:52.486
stood against our lord
and master Aku's tyranny.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.989
But Aku was too powerful.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.867
He made an example of my father

10:57.950 --> 11:00.744
and entrapped him in a ring of fire.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.789
He has been imprisoned for eternity

that he committed against Aku.

that somewhere in this desert

11:12.256 --> 11:15.801
lays a hidden magical jewel
of great power,

11:16.468 --> 11:21.140
a power strong enough to free my father.

11:21.390 --> 11:25.644

was the last survivor

11:25.728 --> 11:28.564
of an ancient race of desert dwellers.

11:28.647 --> 11:32.276
He, alone,
knew the whereabouts of the jewel.

11:32.943 --> 11:36.405

11:36.864 --> 11:39.241
Now with the commotion
that we have caused,

11:39.325 --> 11:43.078
I'm afraid it may take me
another five years to find him,

11:43.746 --> 11:44.830
if at all.

that our paths have crossed.

we will have the power
to defeat the demon.

showed me how to find
the all-powerful jewel.

we will use its power to free your father

Ikra?

20:08.667 --> 20:10.752
AKU: No, fool!

20:11.962 --> 20:14.214
It is I,

20:14.297 --> 20:15.841
Aku.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.847
Yes, Samurai, you have been betrayed.

20:21.930 --> 20:25.642
I and Ikra are one and the same.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.310
No!

20:27.477 --> 20:29.062
Oh, yes.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.940
You see, I had a dream...

20:32.107 --> 20:34.568
No, a nightmare

20:34.860 --> 20:37.112
Of a jewel that had the power

20:37.195 --> 20:39.573
to send you back in time.

20:39.948 --> 20:43.535
I knew that this was no mere dream,

20:43.785 --> 20:45.996
but a premonition.

20:46.580 --> 20:50.542
I had to destroy this powerful jewel,

20:51.168 --> 20:55.046
but I did not know its whereabouts.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.298
JACK: No!

20:56.381 --> 21:00.469
Yes, Samurai.
I knew you would find it.

21:00.886 --> 21:04.848
"Oh, my poor father
trapped in a ring of fire

21:04.931 --> 21:07.642
by mean old Aku."

21:12.439 --> 21:14.483
Fool!

21:15.692 --> 21:16.818
(SCREAMS)

21:18.278 --> 21:20.280
Fight me, coward!

21:20.614 --> 21:22.949
Soon we will fight.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.452
But not until I find a way

21:25.535 --> 21:28.163
to defeat you and your sword.

21:28.497 --> 21:30.290
Now, how did you put it?

21:30.707 --> 21:31.958
Oh, yes.

21:32.209 --> 21:35.337
Your time on this miserable

21:35.420 --> 21:40.342
Aku-infested land continues.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.219
(LAUGHING)

21:44.387 --> 21:45.639
(SCREAMING)

21:53.730 --> 21:56.358
I will destroy you, Aku.

21:56.733 --> 21:57.984
I swear it.
