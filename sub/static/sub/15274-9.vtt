09:31.491 --> 09:32.901

ANYTHING.

WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

09:57.137 --> 10:01.017
I THINK I BROKE IT.

10:04.685 --> 10:07.315
OH...

YEAH, IT HURTS.

10:26.837 --> 10:29.047
OKAY, SO, UH, YOU WANT
TO PUT SOME ICE ON IT?

10:29.049 --> 10:30.339

10:30.340 --> 10:32.210
OH, LET MOMMY SEE IT.

10:32.212 --> 10:34.762

10:34.755 --> 10:36.135
OKAY, FINE, FINE.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.966

TO GO SEE DR. PARKS.

10:37.968 --> 10:40.138
FINE, WE'LL JUST --
HE'LL KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.760
COME ON. COME ON.

10:41.762 --> 10:43.682
NO, PUT THAT DOWN.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.694
THAT'S WHAT GOT YOU
INTO THIS MESS.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.106
COME ON, BOY.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.770
ALL RIGHT.

10:51.772 --> 10:53.942
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
JUST FINE, JUNIOR.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.284

10:55.275 --> 10:56.905
THERE'S
NO LASTING DAMAGE.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.987
I PROMISE.
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

10:58.989 --> 11:00.369
BASICALLY, YOU HAD

11:00.370 --> 11:03.160
WHAT'S COMMONLY KNOWN
AS A MUSCLE SPASM.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.003
OH, MY GOD.

11:04.995 --> 11:06.995

YOU CAN GET THOSE

11:06.997 --> 11:08.997
IN, YOU KNOW, THAT AREA.

11:08.999 --> 11:11.839
WELL, UH,
ANYTIME YOU USE A MUSCLE

11:11.842 --> 11:13.002
AND YOU, UH,

11:13.003 --> 11:16.063
USE IT AND USE IT
AND USE IT AND USE IT.

11:16.056 --> 11:17.386
RIGHT.

11:17.387 --> 11:19.467
SO AS FOR TREATMENT
OF MUSCLE SPASMS --

11:19.469 --> 11:21.429
I GOT IT, DOC --
CONSTANT MASSAGE.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.061
[ Laughing ]
NO, NO, NO.

11:23.063 --> 11:25.073
I REALLY RECOMMEND
HOT BATHS

11:25.065 --> 11:26.855
AND, UH,
MOST IMPORTANT IS REST.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.857
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME,
JUNIOR?

11:28.859 --> 11:31.109
I DON'T KNOW, DOC.

11:31.111 --> 11:34.151
HA HA HA. SERIOUSLY.

11:34.154 --> 11:36.084
OH, I'M SERIOUS.

11:36.076 --> 11:37.866
OKAY.

11:37.868 --> 11:40.238
I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME, SON.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.120
UH, IT'S LIKE A BICYCLE.

11:43.123 --> 11:46.923
IF YOU RIDE IT EVERY DAY,
IT WON'T LAST LONG,

11:46.917 --> 11:49.997
BUT...
IF YOU JUST USE IT

11:50.000 --> 11:52.830
TO GO TO THE STORE
NOW AND THEN,

11:52.833 --> 11:55.393
IT SHOULD LAST A LIFETIME.

11:55.385 --> 11:57.835
YOU GOT IT?

11:57.838 --> 11:59.008
I GOT IT.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.049
WELL,
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

12:01.051 --> 12:03.391
YEAH, THANKS A LOT.

12:07.808 --> 12:10.938
HEY, BABY.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

12:10.941 --> 12:12.731
I'M ALL RIGHT.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.912
I JUST WON'T BE
RIDING MY BIKE FOR A WHILE.

12:14.905 --> 12:17.025
WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU'RE FINE,

12:17.027 --> 12:19.067
AND DON'T WORRY.
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

12:19.069 --> 12:21.069
WHO WERE YOU CALLING
OUT THERE?

12:21.071 --> 12:24.241
WHAT? OH, THAT WAS YOUR DAD.
HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.374
BET HE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
LIKE YOU DID.

12:26.366 --> 12:29.036
WHAT?
I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.829
I SAW YOU.
NO, NO.

12:30.831 --> 12:34.171
WHAT YOU SAW WAS JOY
WHEN I KNEW YOU WERE FINE.

12:34.174 --> 12:36.804
I MEAN,
THE SHEER RELIEF --

12:36.797 --> 12:37.967
MOM.

12:37.968 --> 12:39.138
WHAT?

12:39.139 --> 12:43.639
[ Laughing ]
I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU.

12:43.643 --> 12:47.893
BABY, I WAS LAUGHING
AT THE SITUATION.

12:47.888 --> 12:49.058
HA HA HA.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.059
I GUESS
IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.271
IT'S JUST
SO EMBARRASSING.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.903
NOW, HOLD ON NOW.

12:54.895 --> 12:57.105
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

12:57.107 --> 12:59.107
OKAY?
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

12:59.109 --> 13:01.109
GOING ON WITH YOU
RIGHT NOW, JUNIOR,

13:01.111 --> 13:03.491
AND ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU'RE FEELING

13:03.493 --> 13:06.173
AND THINKING
ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.996
SO YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

TRY READING SOME
OF THE THOSE MAGAZINES

13:12.252 --> 13:14.252
FOR A WEEK OR TWO.

13:21.761 --> 13:24.761
NOW DAD AND ROGER ARE PUTTING
THEIR STUPID GOLF BALLS.

13:24.764 --> 13:26.734
IT'S LIKE
I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

13:26.726 --> 13:28.726
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

13:28.728 --> 13:30.978
MOM, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

13:30.981 --> 13:32.981
WELL, THERE IS
A PERIOD OF TIME

13:32.983 --> 13:34.353
JUST AFTER THE SUPER BOWL,

13:34.354 --> 13:36.574
BUT RIGHT BEFORE
THE BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS --

13:36.566 --> 13:38.356
IF YOU HAVE
ANY EMOTIONAL ISSUES,

13:38.358 --> 13:40.148
YOU BRING THEM UP THEN.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.860
THEY WERE JUST OUT
PLAYING CATCH IN THE YARD.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.363
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

13:44.364 --> 13:46.294

THEY'RE BONDING.

MOM, THEY HAVE PLANS TO GO
MINIATURE GOLFING TOMORROW.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.369

IT SHOULD BE FUN.

13:50.370 --> 13:53.000
ROGER SAID
HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME.

13:53.003 --> 13:56.423
HE SAID HE WANTED
SOME ALONE TIME WITH DAD.

13:56.416 --> 13:57.456

13:57.457 --> 13:58.757
REALLY.

13:58.758 --> 14:00.668

SUPPOSED TO DO?

14:00.670 --> 14:04.170
OH, YOU NEED TO DUMP
THAT LITTLE BOY.

14:07.227 --> 14:09.227

14:09.229 --> 14:10.889

KEEP YOUR EYE

14:16.026 --> 14:17.856
ON THE BALL, ALL RIGHT?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.237
THIS IS
A VERY SPECIAL BALL.

14:19.239 --> 14:20.819
IT HAS TIGER'S NAME
WRITTEN ON IT.

14:20.820 --> 14:24.030
CHECK THIS OUT.
I'M AT THE 100th U.S. OPEN,

14:24.034 --> 14:26.124
STANDING 400 YARDS
FROM THE TEE.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.746
TIGER HITS ME IN THE HEAD
WITH THIS BALL.

14:28.748 --> 14:31.748
IT WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

14:31.751 --> 14:33.751

14:33.753 --> 14:35.923

THROUGH THE SWING,

ALL RIGHT?
IF YOU MAKE THIS PUTT,

14:37.918 --> 14:39.918

OUT TO THE RANGE,

SOME POINTERS ON PUTTING.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.534

I AM ON THAT WINDMILL.

THE WAR IS OVER.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.740

CLAIRE DUMPED HIM.

15:11.741 --> 15:12.991
I KNOW.

15:12.993 --> 15:14.583
AND SHE'S ALREADY
ON TO THE NEXT CRUSH

ACCORDING TO THE NOTEBOOK,

15:16.166 --> 15:17.996

WASN'T RIGHT FOR ROGER,

IMMEDIATELY.

HE'S A GREAT KID.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.011
I MEAN, HE'S NICE.
HE'S SMART.

15:33.013 --> 15:34.433
YOU CAN'T
KEEP SEEING ROGER.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.444
WHY NOT?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.436
BECAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER
DUMPED HIM.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.858
IT VIOLATES THE BASIC
FATHER-DAUGHTER CODE --

15:40.860 --> 15:42.860
WHEN THE DAUGHTER
BREAKS UP WITH THE BOY,

15:42.862 --> 15:45.072
THE FATHER CAN'T THEN
DATE HIM.

15:45.065 --> 15:47.025
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:47.027 --> 15:48.987
WE'RE PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

BECAUSE HE LISTENS TO ME.

"DAD, YOU'RE THE COOLEST THING
ON THE PLANET."

16:34.704 --> 16:37.124

HE USED TO WORSHIP ME.

16:37.117 --> 16:38.207

16:38.208 --> 16:41.208
NOW HE JUST WORSHIPS

THAT WAS VERY SELFISH
OF ME TO ASK.

19:01.060 --> 19:02.640
I SHOULD GO NOW.

19:06.266 --> 19:08.316
HEY, ROGER.

19:08.318 --> 19:09.688
YEAH?

19:09.689 --> 19:12.319
MY TIGER BALL --

19:12.322 --> 19:15.202
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.365
OW!

19:34.504 --> 19:36.514
ALL RIGHT, DAD.

19:36.506 --> 19:38.296
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST DYING
TO CRITICIZE ME.

19:38.298 --> 19:40.718
SO WHAT IS IT?
WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

19:40.720 --> 19:43.140
AM I NOT AS GOOD
AS ROGER?

19:43.142 --> 19:46.022
NO, YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING
PRETTY GOOD.

19:46.015 --> 19:47.725
REALLY?

19:47.727 --> 19:50.517
YEAH, JUST DON'T BREAK
THAT JOYSTICK.

19:52.732 --> 19:54.942
I'LL GO EASY.
I PROMISE.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.954
SO HOW DID YOU GET GOOD
SO FAST?

19:56.946 --> 20:00.026
I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T EVEN
GET PAST LEVEL ONE.

20:00.029 --> 20:02.159
WELL, I'VE HAD SOME
EXTRA TIME TO PRACTICE.

20:02.161 --> 20:04.371
OH, RIGHT.

20:04.374 --> 20:05.964
SEE,
MOM SUGGESTED READING,

20:05.955 --> 20:08.455
BUT YOU KNOW THAT
"FIELD & STREAM" MAGAZINE?

20:08.458 --> 20:11.668
IT'S ACTUALLY
ABOUT FIELDS AND STREAMS.

20:11.671 --> 20:14.921
IMAGINE THAT.

20:14.924 --> 20:16.304
WELL,

20:16.296 --> 20:19.216
FINISH PLAYING YOUR GAME.
I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.838
HEY, DAD.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.260
HMM?

20:22.262 --> 20:23.972
WANT TO PLAY?

20:23.973 --> 20:27.193
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL
LIKE I'M CRITICIZING YOU --

20:27.186 --> 20:28.726
DAD.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.938
AFTER I KICK YOUR BEHIND
ON THIS --

20:30.940 --> 20:32.980
BRING IT ON.

20:44.324 --> 20:46.544
THE WAY YOU HANDLE IT
WILL HAVE A LOT OF EFFECT

20:46.536 --> 20:47.786
ON THE WAY SHE FEELS
ABOUT MEN.

20:47.787 --> 20:49.827
I DON'T KNOW MY LINE.

20:49.829 --> 20:52.209
I'VE MESSED IT UP
ANYWAY, SO...

20:52.211 --> 20:54.921
THE JUICE --
GET THE SODA.

20:54.924 --> 20:57.684
HUH?
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT?

20:57.677 --> 20:59.047
Director: ACTION.

20:59.048 --> 21:00.428
I'M NOT HAVING FUN.

21:00.430 --> 21:01.930
I'M...
