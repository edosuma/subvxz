00:12.380 --> 00:16.679
Fixed and Resynced for BIA Repack by
- Cookie Monsta -

00:18.080 --> 00:20.360
A fat man in a Kia...
Woah, there she goes!

00:21.240 --> 00:24.440
..and a race against
the Lord God Almighty. Come on!

00:30.560 --> 00:32.280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:32.280 --> 00:34.320
Hello, everybody! Thank you so much.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.240
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:40.640 --> 00:46.520
Richard Hammond says that back in
the 1980s, when he was a small boy,-
there were only two cars that

00:46.720 --> 00:53.280
caused him to run about his house
in Birmingham clutching feverishly
at his as yet unformed tinkle.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.640
LAUGHTER

00:55.880 --> 00:58.680
So you can imagine how
excited he was when

00:58.800 --> 01:02.880
the producer said to him this week
he could drive both of them.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.440
We've been wanting to
get these two together
for as long as I can remember,

01:11.680 --> 01:13.480
We've been wanting to
get these two together
for as long as I can remember,

01:13.720 --> 01:16.320
and we've finally got hold of them.
And, well,

01:20.680 --> 01:23.560
which is why
I've kipped the night at the track.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.720
And I believe they are here.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.040
In 1986, Porsche launched
the greatest supercar

01:36.600 --> 01:40.680
the world had ever seen, the 959.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.600
And then, a year later, Ferrari
responded with the greatest supercar

01:46.840 --> 01:49.400
the world had ever seen, the F40.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.560
Oh, my word!

01:53.560 --> 01:55.520
Would you just look at that?!

02:00.440 --> 02:04.840
I can't recall ever seeing these two-
together on television before.

02:05.320 --> 02:08.160
So let's get cracking,
beginning with this one.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.760
Come on, Richard, stay professional!-
Oh, ho! Oh, ho!

02:17.720 --> 02:20.880
When the 959 first came along
in 1986,

02:21.160 --> 02:25.920
it was the most advanced
and most high-tech car ever made.

02:28.240 --> 02:34.680
I'm not talking about the upmarket
pleasantness of my surroundings, the-
air-con, electric seats and so on.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.400
No, it's cleverer stuff than that.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.280
For example,
it had adjustable suspension

02:44.120 --> 02:47.840
and a complex
four-wheel-drive system.

02:48.400 --> 02:53.040
You could split the power between
the front and back wheels not just
according to how much grip you had

02:53.440 --> 02:57.480
but how you were cornering, how much-
G-force you were putting down.

03:00.280 --> 03:00.560
You can just feel...

03:02.160 --> 03:02.560
I mean, I've driven - I have owned --
911s from this period,

03:05.040 --> 03:07.240
I mean, I've driven - I have owned --
911s from this period,

03:07.240 --> 03:09.840
and this thing just
feels so much more!

03:13.760 --> 03:15.680
And the tech fest didn't stop there.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.480
The 959 came with a million things
we'd never seen before -

03:20.720 --> 03:26.600
tyre pressure sensors, for example,
and magnesium wheels
with hollow spokes.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.320
No wonder Bill Gates bought one.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.480
And while we're on the subject
of Billy Microsoft,

03:34.720 --> 03:37.320
he was one of the few people back
then who could have afforded to pay

03:37.520 --> 03:39.200
the proper price
for one of these things.

03:39.400 --> 03:43.800
Because in the 80s,
Porsche asked £150,000 for a 959,

03:44.000 --> 03:49.720
but it actually cost them £300,000
to make, it was so advanced.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.600
Other famous owners included
my style hero Don Johnson,

03:56.840 --> 04:02.440
and a young Boris Becker,
who maxed out his 959
on the Italian Autostrada,

04:02.640 --> 04:04.920
which must have been lively!

04:05.000 --> 04:07.760
A 959 was fast.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.560
Really fast.

04:10.840 --> 04:17.920
Thanks to its 444 brake horse power,-
2.9 litre flat six
turbocharged engine.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.040
In fact, the top speed
was 197 miles an hour...

04:25.040 --> 04:29.720
..which in 1986 made it the fastest
production car in the world.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.400
Oh! When the turbos come on!
Oh, ho! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Oh!

04:38.080 --> 04:42.920
However, its reign as the speed king-
was short-lived...

04:45.000 --> 04:46.800
..thanks to this.

04:49.080 --> 04:53.080
The 201 mile an hour Ferrari F40.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.640
God!

05:02.120 --> 05:04.040
It's the ONE that gets me.

05:04.160 --> 05:07.040
Not 200, 201.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.560
It's like when kids say,
"Everything you say plus one!"

05:12.400 --> 05:19.880
So we know that Ferrari has
a higher top speed than the Porsche,-
but what about acceleration?

05:20.080 --> 05:22.720
You know,
I feel a drag race coming on.

05:22.800 --> 05:27.000
I am, as you know,
a big fan of Porsches.

05:27.280 --> 05:32.480
And it's not that I think that 959
is going to lose or anything,

05:32.760 --> 05:38.040
but it's a cold day, and I think
it's best if I stay here in this car,

05:38.160 --> 05:42.440
the one that's 250 kilograms lighter

05:42.480 --> 05:48.040
and has got 478 brake horse power
instead of 444.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.640
ENGINE REVS

06:03.760 --> 06:07.000
Both these cars have twin turbos.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.200
Both 2.9 litres.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.520
Oh, it's going to be close!

06:17.360 --> 06:19.880
It's going to be close!

06:22.440 --> 06:25.160
I think the Porsche is taking it!

06:26.600 --> 06:27.680
The Porsche is going to win!

06:33.040 --> 06:34.600
Enzo would not like that result.

06:36.200 --> 06:40.000
I'll be honest, a couple of my gear
changes could have been slicker.

06:40.960 --> 06:46.440
Dial out my iffy gear changes,
though, and these two would
cross the line neck-and-neck.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.680
And that's odd,
because they are very different.

06:51.880 --> 06:55.680
Where the 959 is all
hi-tech and luxury,

06:55.960 --> 07:02.480
the F40 has string for door handles,-
no carpets and wind-up windows.

07:02.640 --> 07:07.800
What you get in this car is a twin
turbo V8, some windscreen wipers,

07:07.920 --> 07:10.080
and that's about it.

07:13.640 --> 07:19.480
It was the first car to be
made entirely of carbon-fibre,

07:19.520 --> 07:22.040
which is only just starting
to happen in Formula One.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.880
The lightness and the stiffness of
it, allied to that colossal power,

07:28.200 --> 07:32.280
made it a bit of a hyper
go-kart through the corners.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.000
As a Porsche fan,
it pains me to say this,

07:36.320 --> 07:41.040
but in the corners,
the F40 is far more exciting.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.520
God... The steering wheel is alive!

07:48.960 --> 07:51.240
Oh! Ho, ho!

07:53.040 --> 07:55.360
This thing is so sharp.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.720
Oh, God!

07:59.920 --> 08:01.680
I'm sorry to keep squeaking

08:01.960 --> 08:05.480
and making noises, and if it's
disturbing you, I apologise.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.720
So often it is,
"Don't drive your heroes."

08:10.880 --> 08:12.720
Not this time.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.440
It's better than
I could have imagined.

08:14.760 --> 08:19.120
Better than I ever knew as a kid
looking at pictures of it.

08:28.200 --> 08:34.760
Choosing between these two is like
choosing between shirt or trousers --
it's pointless.

08:34.919 --> 08:39.000
But I will stay this,
we simply wouldn't be
where we are now without them.

08:40.799 --> 08:45.480
Because these two cars are,
I believe, incredibly important.

08:45.800 --> 08:52.520
It's this pair that took
road cars to and beyond
the 200-mile-an-hour barrier.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.800
Before them we had Countaches
and Testarossas,

08:56.000 --> 09:00.880
and in evolutionary terms they were
like man first making it into space.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.880
With these two,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.600
it was man walking on the moon.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.600
They really are that important.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.920
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:24.120 --> 09:27.480
Sorry. What? No, I'm sorry. Sorry.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.120
Woah, woah, woah. Did you...

09:30.320 --> 09:33.960
Did you say it was pointless
to decide which of these was best?

09:34.160 --> 09:38.240
Yeah. Well, it IS pointless. Well,
apart from the fact that the 959 is

09:38.480 --> 09:43.840
neither here nor there and the F40
is probably the greatest car
ever built in human history.

09:44.080 --> 09:49.440
No, look, if I'm honest
I prefer the F40 as well, but we
mustn't forget the 959 WAS important

09:49.640 --> 09:54.880
because it set the trend for
computers and sensors that modern
supercars have followed ever since.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.520
Yes, and I wish they hadn't.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.560
I wish they'd all followed
the route set by the F40 -

09:59.800 --> 10:04.600
it's a twin turbocharged V8 go-kart,
it's just very simple. It's better.
 I know what you mean,

10:04.840 --> 10:06.320
it's analogue versus digital. It is.

10:06.480 --> 10:10.320
But anyway, we must now find out
how fast they go round our track.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.960
The owners must be insane
to let us do this. Of course.
LAUGHTER

10:14.200 --> 10:16.440
Handing them over
to our tame racing driver.

10:16.680 --> 10:22.320
Some say that his favourite disease-
he had when he was a child was gout.
LAUGHTER

10:22.360 --> 10:25.840
And that he was very surprised
 this week when he was able to

10:25.960 --> 10:30.040
pick up some remarkably cheap
tickets for the Bahrain Grand Prix.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.720
All we know is he's called
the Stig!
CHEERING

10:34.800 --> 10:36.800
And he's...

10:36.920 --> 10:38.760
not going anywhere.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.600
He is obviously...
There's something wrong there.
 Oh, dear, yes.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.400
LAUGHTER
 There's something VERY wrong.
What the Hell's happened there?

10:46.520 --> 10:51.680
And across the line
and into the garage!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

10:51.760 --> 10:56.040
That's not good.
It's awkward. You see? You see?

10:56.080 --> 10:58.640
I know what you're going to say...

10:58.920 --> 11:04.160
Let me say it anyway. The Ferrari is-
fragile, that's why I like Porsche,
because they may not be as exciting

11:04.400 --> 11:07.640
to look at, but they are durable
and tough, and that wins in the end.

11:07.840 --> 11:12.280
Yes, yes, yes. All right.
Come on, let's have a look
 at how the 959 got on.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.920
And, yes, that one
is actually going.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.600
It is incredible how soft
it looks as it rocks about.

11:19.640 --> 11:26.040
Also looks rather old-fashioned
and, I must say, very slow.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.320
He's got a problem in there,
he must have.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.960
Here's Chicago.

11:32.160 --> 11:35.040
That's an even bigger problem,
that is.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.520
Oh!

11:44.560 --> 11:46.720
So what had gone wrong?

11:46.800 --> 11:49.640
What happened? Well, apparently...

11:49.920 --> 11:52.800
yes, I've just heard
that the turbos let go.

11:53.160 --> 11:59.200
So that had no boost, that lost
its seal, so what we've got here
for the first time ever

11:59.280 --> 12:04.080
is a DNF - a did not finish -
and a DNS - did not start. Yeah.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.280
LAUGHTER

12:06.520 --> 12:07.720
Right, and now the news.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.400
And the Bahrain Grand Prix, because-
it's been cancelled, well this is a-
 bit of an issue, because...?

12:12.600 --> 12:15.280
It was supposed to be the first
race of the season. Yeah.

12:15.560 --> 12:19.120
So are they going to replace it
 with something else,
just going to forget about it?

12:19.280 --> 12:22.520
Well, they can hardly stage it
in Tunisia, can they? Maybe Egypt?

12:22.800 --> 12:25.760
Wait, wait, wait.
Why don't we offer them our track?

12:25.800 --> 12:28.000
LAUGHTER

12:28.280 --> 12:31.560
Really, why can't we hold it here?
It makes sense.
Most F1 teams are UK-based,

12:31.720 --> 12:33.240
So it's convenient.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.240
And catering, we've got that caravan-
next to the security hut. Yes.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.240
And if it rains, there is
the security hut itself.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.720
Were you all able to park easily
today? ALL: YES. Oh, mate, F1 here.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.560
Plus, Bahrain,
incredibly boring track.

12:48.720 --> 12:52.800
You can crash off
for miles on those run-off areas
and not actually hit anything.

12:53.080 --> 12:59.520
Whereas here, we could offer
the prestigious opportunity to
 crash into an old Boeing 747.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.080
Hang on a minute, though.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.080
Isn't our track a figure of eight?

13:03.240 --> 13:07.640
Yes, it is! That makes it even
better! Imagine, you're in an F1 car,
you'd be flat out

13:07.760 --> 13:10.880
towards follow-through. About to
go right, and then there'd be

13:10.960 --> 13:14.440
another F1 car coming the other way
about to go left towards Chicago.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.480
Your closing speed is
about 350 miles an hour.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.360
I think...
I think the most common phrase

13:21.680 --> 13:25.520
we'd hear from the commentary team
would be, "Tumbling end over end."

13:25.760 --> 13:29.840
Anyway, Bernie, if you like this
idea or want to take us up on it,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.440
"Well, you've
got more viewers than us anyway."

13:35.480 --> 13:37.360
Now, anyone here from London?

13:37.640 --> 13:41.120
YES. Right. You're all
familiar with the Westway?

13:41.200 --> 13:44.000
It's a big snaking ribbon
 of tarmac that scythes

13:44.040 --> 13:45.640
into the centre of the city,

13:45.800 --> 13:50.320
the idea being it gets you
in as quickly as possible
 and out as quickly as possible.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.360
For many years it had
 a 50-mile-an-hour speed limit,
which is too low,

13:53.600 --> 13:57.360
but they've decided this week
to lower it to 30.
30 miles an hour!

13:57.440 --> 14:00.000
I tried driving down there
earlier this week

14:00.080 --> 14:04.080
at 30 miles an hour,
I damn nearly caused 27 accidents.
A little girl on a scooter,

14:04.160 --> 14:06.960
she was like,
"What are you doing, you idiot?!"

14:07.200 --> 14:12.840
Isn't it a temporary speed limit
while they do some works underneath
the bridge bit or something?

14:12.920 --> 14:18.480
Yes. But when they introduced
the 70-mile-an-hour limit on
all British motorways in 1965,

14:18.560 --> 14:21.040
they said then that was temporary.
Here we are 46 years later,

14:21.320 --> 14:22.800
we've still got it.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.840
Speed limits are like herpes.

14:25.080 --> 14:30.080
Are they? Yeah, you get them,
you never get rid of them. Forever.-
LAUGHTER

14:30.360 --> 14:33.760
It doesn't look... Why is that man
nodding and going, "I know, yeah"?

14:33.880 --> 14:36.720
I've got speed limits!

14:36.840 --> 14:40.560
This road, OK,
 is run by Boris Johnson, yes?

14:40.680 --> 14:43.920
Boris Johnson wrote a piece in Her
Majesty's Daily Telegraph last week

14:44.080 --> 14:47.000
in which he said he didn't want
to be forced to wear a helmet
while skiing

14:47.160 --> 14:50.440
because as an individual he should
be allowed to make up his own mind,

14:50.480 --> 14:52.680
and he doesn't want governments
telling him what to do.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.800
HE CLEARS THROAT
Boris...

14:55.120 --> 14:57.960
I give you that.
It is weird, isn't it?

14:58.040 --> 15:01.840
We all think of Boris Johnson
as being cuddly and affable
and having slightly funny hair,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.840
but history will remember
him as Boris the Oppressor.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.680
He is. Boris is a Russian name,

15:06.880 --> 15:10.320
and this is a Russian thing to do.
 But listen, Boris,

15:10.520 --> 15:13.000
when whatever it is you're doing
under that bridge is finished,

15:13.120 --> 15:15.040
I want to see that 30 limit gone.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.080
A serious point if I may,
last year we showed you a tribute

15:18.280 --> 15:20.920
to Ayrton Senna on Top Gear,
a little film we made.

15:21.160 --> 15:25.360
Now there's a much longer
one come out, 90 minutes,
an incredible documentary.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.400
This is completely unmissable.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.240
I've got a clip for you here,
I want you to have a look at this.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.040
He will be ranked
among the all-time greats.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.640
Ayrton has a small problem,
he thinks that he can't kill himself.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.640
And I think that's very dangerous.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.200
We are competing to win.

15:41.320 --> 15:45.680
And if you no longer go for a gap,
you are no longer a racing driver.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.440
Senna is trying
 to go through on the inside!

15:53.000 --> 15:55.680
I was treated like a criminal.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.680
The best decision is MY decision.

15:58.920 --> 16:02.680
Walking away from the dark forces
just doesn't become an option.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.960
I was not going to give up.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.600
Real racing, that makes me happy.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.040
There's footage in that you just
can't believe. I've got goosebumps.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.840
It's unbelievable.
It's just won an award, actually,

16:23.040 --> 16:28.000
at the Sundance Film Festival,
as best documentary, and I'm really-
 not surprised. It's out in June.

16:28.200 --> 16:32.600
If you've got any heart,
 any soul at all, you've got to
go and see it, it's fantastic.

16:32.680 --> 16:33.640
Anyway, moving on...

16:34.680 --> 16:40.320
Yes, BMW has launched a whole
sort of eco flavour of cars
beginning with the letter "I".

16:40.560 --> 16:45.480
They've got two so far, the i3
 and the i8. Do you want to see
a picture of them? Here they are.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.240
Very difficult to see out of.
Or get in.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.880
That's not going to work, is it?!
What is this current obsession

16:52.160 --> 16:55.960
with putting "I" in front of things
and believing that
makes them special?

16:56.200 --> 16:58.200
It started with
the iPod, yeah, fair enough.

16:58.440 --> 17:02.000
But we are going to have
an iSandwich and iShoes.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.319
I don't want an iInfection. No.
I don't want one of THOSE, though.

17:06.560 --> 17:11.200
Yeah. Oh, now, listen,
Chrysler is going to launch this
little £11,000 car in Britain,

17:11.640 --> 17:15.880
and the first thing you need
 to know about it is it
isn't a Chrysler.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.680
What it is, OK,
what happens is... Here's the story.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.040
Fiat make the 500, OK?

17:21.319 --> 17:25.400
They then give that to Lancia,
who make it a bit longer
and add two rear doors,

17:25.640 --> 17:29.280
then Lancia give that to Chrysler,
who take the Lancia badges off,

17:29.520 --> 17:32.160
put Chrysler ones on and they're
 going to sell it in Britain.

17:32.360 --> 17:36.840
So Fiat have gone as far
 as recycling their cars before
they've even sold them? Yes.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.440
It's not a car at all,
it's kind of an archaeological dig.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.560
You scratch away at the pads

17:40.800 --> 17:45.760
then underneath you discover, "Yes,
it was a Lancia." Then you go a bit
further, you'll find it was a Fiat.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.800
Not just a Fiat 500, because
if you actually keep going,
you'll find it's a Fiat Panda,

17:49.960 --> 17:55.880
which is effectively what it is.
Dig a bit further and you'll find
a load of coins and a bronze helmet.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.520
The Piltdown Man is in
the glove box of that car.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.160
Let's make it go away,
because, more importantly,

18:01.320 --> 18:05.480
Aston Martin, have launched a new
 car this week called the Virage.

18:05.760 --> 18:09.440
The idea is fits between
the quite soft and comfy DB9
 and the much more expensive DBS.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.920
Fantastic looking thing.

18:14.120 --> 18:20.200
What is there to say? It's going to-
cost, apparently, around £150,000,
 V12 engine, absolutely perfect.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.520
Just one thing - underneath,
of course, it is a Fiat 500.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.080
Cos everything is.
 Because everything is.

18:26.160 --> 18:31.320
Now, round about 20 years ago,
Peugeot made the momentous decision

18:31.480 --> 18:37.520
to stop making nice cars
and make instead NOT very nice cars-
for elderly people.

18:37.760 --> 18:44.200
Yes, but now they've had another
change of heart, and they've come
up with this. It's called the EX1.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.240
It's a twin-engined four-wheel
drive electric roadster, and it's...

18:48.520 --> 18:51.840
Well, the main purpose of it,
really, Hammond,
is to break records.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.800
Rather like myself, actually.
Really? Yeah. Anyway,

18:55.040 --> 19:00.560
look at this. You open the door,
 but when you do you also get...

19:00.680 --> 19:02.320
A broken wrist?
LAUGHTER

19:02.560 --> 19:04.760
No, you also get...
look, you get the seat.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.640
Oh, wow!
The seat is part of the climb in.

19:06.920 --> 19:11.040
Half the car comes with it,
so I'm actually getting into
the door's pocket now

19:11.280 --> 19:14.880
with all, like, the crisp packets
and the change? Feet up,
get your feet right up.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.160
I put my feet in there? Yeah, and
then... Oh, yes! Look at this!

19:18.360 --> 19:22.040
Hey, that steering wheel is very
Batman. It does all that and that.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.280
And that's where the instruments
are up on those two screens.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.240
That's fantastic, look!

19:27.520 --> 19:32.600
I have to say, for a Peugeot,
especially, it looks absolutely
 fantastic. It's very funky...

19:32.800 --> 19:35.400
Look at his face!
It's very funky and very modern,

19:35.480 --> 19:38.880
and you can expect to see this in
your local Peugeot dealership...

19:39.080 --> 19:40.360
never.

19:40.520 --> 19:47.200
Moving on, with one of the most
ambitious races we've ever staged.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.640
As the sun sets,
I will start from here,

19:49.760 --> 19:53.280
Land's End,
Britain's most westerly point,

19:53.480 --> 19:55.000
and I will attempt to get to here

19:55.280 --> 19:58.360
in Lowestoft,
Britain's most easterly point,

19:58.440 --> 20:00.000
before it rises again.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.840
Now, to make this especially hard,
 I was made to do the race on

20:04.000 --> 20:08.320
Midsummer's Day,
during the shortest night we had.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.560
This is a big one.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.240
Space is a never-ending race track.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.000
The thermal shock region on
the prow of our Solar System,
for example,

20:20.280 --> 20:25.800
is screaming through
the heavens at 490,000 mph.

20:25.840 --> 20:30.880
Earth is hurtling round the sun
 at 67,000 mph.

20:31.040 --> 21:08.680
God, it seems,
is a complete speed freak.

21:08.680 --> 21:31.200
The supercharged V it is fast and

21:31.200 --> 21:31.840
Stopwatch. This is it, then. We are
Sunday-night

21:31.840 --> 21:34.240
Sunday-night delegation, at big
Jaguar

21:34.240 --> 21:38.000
Jaguar verses God. It is like songs
of

21:38.000 --> 21:43.800
of Praise, with a supercharger. At
9:36pm,

21:43.800 --> 21:47.640
9:36pm, the sun sank below the
horizon.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.440
horizon. And the race was on. Here
we

21:50.440 --> 21:56.000
we go! Now, that is what do

21:56.000 --> 21:57.400
mysterious sunset green flash is

21:57.400 --> 22:00.360
all about, obviously. It is God's

22:00.360 --> 22:03.680
starting light. He wants to raise
us!

22:03.680 --> 22:06.760
Here are my issues. The sun
will

22:06.760 --> 22:11.400
rise over East Anglia at
4:30am.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.680
That gives me at six hours
and

22:14.680 --> 22:19.440
and 54 minutes to do 432 miles.
That

22:19.440 --> 22:24.440
That means averaging 62 miles an
hour.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.320
At this stage, Don still had

22:27.320 --> 22:30.720
4,200 miles to go before it reached

22:30.720 --> 22:34.160
Lowestoft, but it was doing a
massive

22:34.160 --> 22:37.240
610 miles an hour. One

22:37.240 --> 22:44.440
whole DUP, one red light, Godwins.
And,

22:44.440 --> 22:50.240
And, already he was playing dirty.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.880
Get out of the way! They have all
been

22:53.880 --> 22:56.600
been to watch the sunset at Land's
End

22:56.600 --> 22:58.960
and now they're going back to
the

22:58.960 --> 23:03.280
hotel. This is bad, 30 miles an
hour.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.720
But then, the road

23:06.720 --> 23:10.320
straightened out and did Jaguar
pounced.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.200
Overtaking!

23:17.640 --> 23:24.120
Holy cow! This thing is fast. But

23:24.120 --> 23:27.960
then, it kind of would be because
the

23:27.960 --> 23:30.840
the supercharged engine produces

23:30.840 --> 23:34.280
more power and torque than a six-
litre

23:34.280 --> 23:42.000
V 12 in an Aston Martin Raff
peak.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.840
peak. It is unhinged performance,

23:43.840 --> 23:47.880
that is what this is. I am going to

23:47.880 --> 23:54.800
thrash God. But then he enlisted

23:54.800 --> 23:59.600
the services of an unusual ally.

23:59.600 --> 24:05.560
The devil's work! The cones went on

24:05.560 --> 24:08.160
for miles and my average speed
collapsed.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.640
I am in Cornwall at
doing

24:09.640 --> 24:15.320
50 miles an hour. This son

24:15.320 --> 24:18.000
has already risen in his Sydney.
God

24:18.000 --> 24:22.040
God was winning. Which meant that

24:22.040 --> 24:23.440
when the road works finished, I

24:23.440 --> 24:29.160
needed to get my foot down. Make it

24:35.520 --> 24:38.280
This is quick car, but there is a

24:38.280 --> 24:41.640
bit more to it than raw speed.

24:41.640 --> 24:45.520
Sitting in an old Jaguar, even the

24:45.520 --> 24:47.760
last one, was like sitting in a

24:47.760 --> 24:54.520
country pub. You were cramps, but

24:54.520 --> 24:57.560
this one, with the blue lighting,

24:57.560 --> 25:02.160
they have even lined this cubbyhole

25:02.160 --> 25:05.800
and glove box with purple velvet!

25:05.800 --> 25:08.000
That is like lifting up the Queen's

25:08.000 --> 25:10.560
Guard and finding she is wearing a

25:13.840 --> 25:15.240
There are other
thoughtful touches, too.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.920
Oh-h-h-h, yes. Hard.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.920
Oh, yeah. Lower, lower

25:18.920 --> 25:20.920
There, there, there!

25:21.760 --> 25:26.160
Yes, as I'm sure you realised,
that's the seat massager at work.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.760
It's, like, kneading me...

25:29.000 --> 25:31.960
and all that. In the seat!

25:33.960 --> 25:36.560
Then there's the stereo system.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.080
In the last Jag, you got a
gramophone with a dog sitting on it,

25:40.240 --> 25:44.160
but in this, I've got 1,200 watts

25:44.280 --> 25:47.640
and it will play anything. Anything.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.280
You just....

25:50.520 --> 25:53.640
you push, you push...

25:53.840 --> 25:54.840
that.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.680
And... er...

26:00.360 --> 26:06.440
By the time I realised I didn't
 understand iPod connectivity,
the sun was over Thailand.

26:08.560 --> 26:14.080
And I was facing
 a decision made by thousands
of holidaymakers every summer -

26:14.360 --> 26:19.120
M5 and M4, or A303 past Stonehenge?

26:20.320 --> 26:27.000
The motorway is 20 miles further,
 but probably better
for fuel consumption.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.360
But the A303 is more fun
 in a car like this.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.280
Yeah, A303 it is!

26:42.200 --> 26:43.200
This was a good call.

26:45.680 --> 26:49.080
There's a whiff
of NASCAR about this car.

26:50.960 --> 26:56.000
And now I'm going to give it
 a bit more, because
I'm going to engage Dynamic Mode.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.640
Look - the dials glow red.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.120
What this does is firms
everything up, gives you more punch.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.040
And also, because the XJ
is made entirely from aluminium,

27:10.200 --> 27:12.760
it's much lighter
than any other big car.

27:13.640 --> 27:16.080
It feels like a sports car.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.360
On good roads like these,

27:20.520 --> 27:23.800
it's not far short of a masterpiece.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.280
And because it has an active
differential, you can do a slider.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.160
The Jag set about
chewing up the miles.

27:50.840 --> 27:51.800
Druids!

27:58.080 --> 28:02.440
By 1:45am, I figured I was
in the lead, but I'd reach the M3.

28:03.240 --> 28:07.960
Which was boring. So I decided
 to let the car drive itself.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.640
Right, cruise control on.
Very good system, this.

28:12.920 --> 28:17.240
Set the speed at 70, and the road
ahead is scanned by microwaves.

28:17.440 --> 28:21.320
I'm going to hook on to the back
of our camera car - there we go -

28:21.520 --> 28:27.320
so now, if he speeds up, I speed if
he slows down, I slow down.
 I don't have to do anything.up,

28:28.960 --> 28:32.840
I can even choose what sort
of distance I want to follow it at.

28:32.880 --> 28:38.760
There's the safe distance there,
 right down to the full Audi.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.840
Yes! There we are,
that's the Audi following distance!

28:45.320 --> 28:46.760
It was now late.

28:47.080 --> 28:52.800
The motorway was monotonous
 and my thoughts turned to the
business of staying sharp.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.440
The production team,
as usual, has provided me with a CD

28:56.640 --> 28:59.920
to keep me awake on this long,
perilous and difficult voyage.

29:02.040 --> 29:07.200
'And it was while working
at Radio Lancashire that
I experienced a revelation.

29:07.440 --> 29:11.680
'I took over as producer
and presenter of the weekend
mid-morning shows.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.320
'I recorded on...

29:14.920 --> 29:16.960
'..carol concerts, jumble sales...'

29:17.120 --> 29:19.720
Hammond's adventures
in local radio weren't helping.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.440
'..record-breaking attempt,
and sponsored swim.'

29:22.640 --> 29:24.880
But soon, something else did.

29:26.160 --> 29:29.320
Ooh, the fuel warning light is on!

29:30.760 --> 29:32.000
INDISTINCT COMMENT

29:33.200 --> 29:34.760
No!

29:36.680 --> 29:39.920
A splash and dash pitstop
cost precious moments.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.800
Here we go. And then Beezlebub
 decided to cost me even more.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.760
Oh, no, no...

29:50.480 --> 29:53.120
This is exactly the sort
 of hold up I can do without.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.960
Is anyone going to be
working on them? I mean, really!

29:57.160 --> 30:00.760
So, you have to drive along
at 50 miles an hour, glaring at the

30:00.880 --> 30:03.680
speedometer, not looking at the
road ahead. That's very dangerous.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.840
It raises money for the government,-
but it's very dangerous.

30:09.680 --> 30:13.240
By the time the roadworks finished,-
God was back in the lead.

30:13.280 --> 30:17.120
He was now just over
one hour from Lowestoft.

30:18.480 --> 30:23.200
65 miles to go, and I would say
that the inky blackness of night...

30:24.320 --> 30:27.200
..has become sort of royal blue.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.480
I don't suppose the sun
would be early, would it?

30:30.680 --> 30:32.120
Would it do that?

30:37.200 --> 30:41.160
There is a smudge
in the sky, a big one.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.520
The mother of fire,
it seems, is coming back.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.960
That is daylight.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.640
I have...

30:54.680 --> 30:56.520
..39 minutes.

30:57.560 --> 31:04.440
There were still 34 miles to go,
but win or lose, I was glad
I'd done this race in the Jag.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.640
An S Class...

31:06.720 --> 31:10.080
may be
a comparable limo to this,

31:10.320 --> 31:14.000
but an S Class doesn't go
 and stop and steer

31:14.160 --> 31:16.400
anything like as well as this.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.680
If you're a keen driver,

31:20.960 --> 31:23.280
this is the only big car
you can have.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.800
The sun was now over Amsterdam

31:29.000 --> 31:31.840
and would appear in Suffolk
 in just 12 minutes.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.880
Come on, come on.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.160
4.9 miles.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.880
Right, where is..

31:47.960 --> 31:50.280
England's most easterly spot?

31:55.040 --> 31:57.440
Come on, I'm lost!

31:59.880 --> 32:01.280
No-o-o

32:01.320 --> 32:02.520
red light now!

32:08.280 --> 32:09.200
Come on!

32:11.640 --> 32:12.640
This is it!

32:23.040 --> 32:24.920
HE LAUGHS

32:35.600 --> 32:37.040
Loser!

32:42.160 --> 32:45.160
I may be the first person
in history to call God a loser!

32:50.440 --> 32:52.840
Here, let me just get this right.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.560
It drives like a sports car?

32:54.720 --> 32:58.320
Yes, very like. It just feels
so light, it's incredible.

32:58.560 --> 33:02.640
It's about £20,000 less than
the equivalent Mercedes S Class.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.400
Yep, the S63, definitely.

33:04.640 --> 33:09.000
And it's faster than the Lord
God Almighty? Yes, it is,
 just, by about five minutes.

33:09.160 --> 33:14.040
But do you know what? I'm just
not sure its the looks. I know.
That's why we filmed it at night.

33:15.760 --> 33:21.360
What makes it doubly annoying is
that Bertolli, which is not Italy's-
most successful styling house,

33:21.640 --> 33:25.800
recently did the concept
of what they think Jaguars
of the future should look like.

33:25.960 --> 33:29.040
That's why we've got a television
 here, so you can have a look.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.880
This is just spectacular,
from any angle.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.280
That is absolutely glorious.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.960
Am I right in thinking
that's got suicide doors?

33:37.160 --> 33:39.040
Yes, it has - they open this way.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.040
Now, this is
an absolutely fantastic car

33:43.280 --> 33:47.200
and I just think if it looked like
that, it would be the best car ever.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.960
Absolutely ever.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.720
Anyway, isn't it time you put a star-
in our reasonably priced car? Yes.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.000
I'm sort of delaying it, really.

33:55.080 --> 33:59.120
Last week we had a very
intelligent, beautiful...

33:59.320 --> 34:01.080
lesbian...

34:01.120 --> 34:03.680
muscle car enthusiast.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.880
This week we've got
the exact opposite of that.

34:07.160 --> 34:11.199
Ladies and gentlemen, make some
noises, please, for John Prescott.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.520
CHEERING

34:14.400 --> 34:16.199
Expected.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.800
I knew they'd do that.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.840
Lord John Prescott.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.880
Thanks for those that cheered.

34:27.120 --> 34:30.199
And those that booed,
well, you know what you can do.

34:31.199 --> 34:34.400
I don't know
where to start with you.
JOHN LAUGHS

34:34.639 --> 34:37.600
I was wondering about that.
 So many questions.

34:37.679 --> 34:40.719
I think the one
that raises to the surface is,

34:40.760 --> 34:43.960
what in the name of all that's holy

34:44.040 --> 34:46.280
were you thinking when you said,

34:46.440 --> 34:50.080
"Let's put a bus lane on the M4."

34:51.080 --> 34:53.320
I'm glad you've said that.

34:57.680 --> 35:02.000
Jeremy, I'm going to introduce you
 to a revolutionary thought -

35:02.080 --> 35:05.320
you can go slower
and get there quicker.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.200
That's to do with flow.

35:07.520 --> 35:12.720
As soon as you made it two lane
 and brought it from 70 to 50,
they got there quicker, actually.

35:13.040 --> 35:18.000
Cars as well. That's not possible.
 Don't take my word. Take the
independent transport research.

35:18.160 --> 35:22.120
It meant that the flow of the
traffic was better. There were
 less accidents, less deaths.

35:22.400 --> 35:26.240
I think that's an important factor.-
You just want to speed
 everywhere, right?

35:26.480 --> 35:30.720
In reality, what we've seen
is the deaths of children
and deaths of adults...

35:30.800 --> 35:34.840
There aren't any children
on the M4 bus lane! It's a
motorway!

35:34.960 --> 35:36.800
There are no schools there.

35:42.120 --> 35:45.640
I used to be able to drive
into London on three lanes.
You made it two.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.360
Yes. You put a speed camera,
you made it 50.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.280
That was daft. And it meant that
the flow of the traffic was

35:52.280 --> 35:55.200
better because people aren't
rushing to the two
lane from three.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.160
I've heard motorists cheering here,-
but don't you get annoyed when
someone wants to push in,

36:00.560 --> 36:03.200
when you've done
your three and your two?

36:05.280 --> 36:08.480
How many people get annoyed at when
they come down to three,
come down to two? Public meeting!

36:08.720 --> 36:11.760
Put your hands up! There you are.
John...

36:12.160 --> 36:14.480
bloody well sit down! Sit down.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.720
They're cheering for me, not you!

36:19.720 --> 36:21.280
All right, fair enough.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.480
Fair enough. Let me ask you this.

36:23.480 --> 36:26.680
If you believe that narrowing
a motorway causes the traffic flow

36:27.000 --> 36:31.560
to be improved, why did you widen
the M25 and the M1? Well...

36:31.880 --> 36:33.920
HE STAMMERS, CHEERING

36:37.560 --> 36:39.120
Why did you do that?

36:39.200 --> 36:40.800
Why didn't you narrow them?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.840
If this is going
to be a public meeting...!

36:44.960 --> 36:49.120
Listen, from 1997,
when we came in, right,

36:49.360 --> 36:53.280
you guys in the public
bought seven million more cars.

36:53.400 --> 36:58.040
Now, if you look at the congestion,-
seven million more cars. Right?

36:58.240 --> 37:01.520
You didn't get rid of the second
car, did you? You passed it down.

37:01.640 --> 37:05.560
So what is happening, the growth
in cars on the motorway...
AUDIENCE JEERS

37:05.640 --> 37:09.240
That's the reality! John!

37:09.440 --> 37:11.440
You don't want
to face the facts, do you?

37:11.520 --> 37:14.080
I knew I'd get that
from you ruddy motorists!

37:14.320 --> 37:20.800
In 1997, YOU said that if there
weren't fewer cars on the roads,

37:21.040 --> 37:27.520
more people using buses by the
time you finished in five years,
you could be judged a failure.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.320
I didn't say that.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.720
You read it.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.080
I know what I said, let me tell
What did you say?you.

37:33.360 --> 37:37.120
If I don't get more people
using public transport,

37:37.440 --> 37:40.720
and using their motor vehicles
that's what I said.less,

37:40.960 --> 37:45.160
But there are more people
 on trains now, more on buses,
right? That was achieved.

37:45.440 --> 37:45.800
But there are more people
 on trains now, more on buses,
right? That was achieved.

37:45.880 --> 37:49.040
What I didn't recognise,
you bought seven million new cars!

37:55.640 --> 37:58.840
That was because of the prosperity
 we brought you under Labour.
You bankrupted the country!

37:58.840 --> 38:02.280
You damn nearly bankrupt us!
You won't get it from this outfit,
be sure of it.

38:04.320 --> 38:09.400
When somebody came to you one day
and said that there was a problem
with the environment and that man

38:09.400 --> 38:12.600
was creating some carbon-dioxide,
which was getting stuck in the
upper atmosphere and this

38:13.040 --> 38:15.440
was going to cause
the world to melt,

38:15.720 --> 38:17.040
you decided the best thing you
 could do is fly to the Maldives?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.520
To go on a diving trip.
No, I didn't.

38:22.360 --> 38:25.840
I went to the Maldives, I was
doing the negotiations at Kyoto.

38:25.840 --> 38:29.240
There's no way you can
bike there. No, but the Maldives
isn't... Hang on.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.920
Just try to understand
what you've got here. Kyoto's in
Japan - it's not in the Maldives!

38:34.160 --> 38:36.360
Hang on, just give
your bloody brain a chance!

38:38.040 --> 38:39.800
I went to the Maldives,
on the way to India.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.680
I went to dive on the coral reefs.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.800
I was arguing that
what was happening is that

38:46.800 --> 38:50.200
these coral reefs
 were being blanched and dying
because the water was getting warm.

38:50.200 --> 38:53.400
I wanted to bring home to people,
 look what is happening here.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.360
People didn't accept it in 1997.
Why can't you do that from Hull?

38:56.680 --> 38:58.120
Why did you need
 to go to the Maldives?

38:58.120 --> 39:02.480
Because that's where you get... At
taxpayers' expense of 6,500 quid?

39:02.800 --> 39:06.680
You've sent me to Kyoto, I'm on the-
way back by India. I negotiate
with the Indian government.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.480
I go via the Maldives and dive
to look at the huge range
of coral reef they've got there.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.760
So, why did you then
go to Sri Lanka?

39:13.760 --> 39:15.760
Sri Lanka was the stop-off for the
plane. I didn't go to Sri Lanka.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.680
I thought you looked at tigers
 there? No, that was in India.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.520
You looked at tigers
and then you went diving...

39:23.520 --> 39:26.520
They asked me to join the Save
the Tiger campaign when I was there-
on the environment negotiations.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.040
Listen,
the tigers are a real problem.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.640
The thing is, John, we know this.
We have David Attenborough to say,
"Tiger numbers are dropping fast."

39:34.000 --> 39:36.360
We read this
in the newspapers all the time.

39:36.360 --> 39:40.120
We don't need to go to India.
Presumably they showed you a tiger?

39:40.760 --> 39:43.840
If they'd have showed you an empty
wood and went, "Look, no tigers..."

39:48.280 --> 39:49.280
It's all right them cheering
and shouting at your clever remark,

39:49.280 --> 39:50.920
but basically...
LAUGHTER

39:50.920 --> 39:54.160
How many...? They like that.
CHEERING DROWNS COMMENT

39:57.280 --> 39:58.800
Sit...down.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.280
Because, can you understand,
 honestly, can you understand

40:01.480 --> 40:03.080
why a man threw an egg at you?

40:08.800 --> 40:10.040
Do know why he did
and what he was concerned about?

40:10.040 --> 40:12.440
I was against fox-hunting
and he thought I was one

40:15.080 --> 40:17.920
of the guys that he hates because
he wanted to keep fox hunting.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.440
But wait a minute when I got pied,
because I understand

40:28.440 --> 40:30.480
that I am very lucky to have this
forum come here every week

40:30.480 --> 40:32.280
on Top Gear and I say things
and I understand that if

40:32.280 --> 40:33.960
someone sitting at home and
violently disagrees with what I say

40:33.960 --> 40:35.600
it is really annoying and this girl
shoved a banoffee pie in my face.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.240
I just went "good shot"
and you punched him.

40:37.240 --> 40:47.120
But don't you understand that
 as a politician you had 13 years
of doing what you want.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.040
I am subjected to what they call
a vote. If they agree or disagree.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.240
Nevertheless, you had all
of these years when you were
allowed to do what you want

40:51.240 --> 40:52.600
and you must have known there were
 people at home sitting thinking,

40:52.880 --> 40:54.480
"I wish they'd stop doing it?"
Did you not understand that?

40:54.880 --> 40:57.160
Let me say, when I walked past this-
guy and he hits me with the egg,

40:57.160 --> 41:00.840
right, I don't know it's an egg,
I just feel this very warm
thing running down my neck.

41:00.840 --> 41:06.640
I just think somebody has perhaps
knifed me or assaulted me,
that all happens in a split second.

41:06.640 --> 41:10.400
And I see this fella built
like a bloody barn door
and I turned and I reacted.

41:10.920 --> 41:14.840
When Tony asked me what happened, I-
said I was carrying out his orders.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.840
He told us to connect with
the electorate, so I did.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.200
LAUGHTER

42:05.560 --> 42:09.040
I had one house a home, and one car.

42:09.040 --> 42:14.120
I still only have one car.

42:14.120 --> 42:17.240
Does anybody here have a company car?

42:17.240 --> 42:22.360
So how many cars have you got?

42:22.360 --> 42:25.720
No, none
No, none is the answer. Anywhere, you

42:25.720 --> 42:34.960
you are a Jaguar man. I have had 11 Jags.

42:34.960 --> 42:38.600
Jags. I made an attempt to go to a Rover

42:40.520 --> 42:41.120
Rover wants. I admired their
engineering.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.560
That was the problem in those days.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.000
Right, your lap,

42:46.000 --> 42:47.280
how was it?

42:47.280 --> 42:49.680
I was a bit worried, I thought
I was skiing rather than driving.
It was a wet day.

42:49.680 --> 42:53.040
The car, I must say,
 was really impressive
as it got into the speeds

42:54.000 --> 42:57.160
and into the corners,
but I was a bit worried
about the puddles, the water.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.680
When I got confident, I enjoyed it.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.520
Who would like to see
Lord John Prescott's lap?

43:03.680 --> 43:04.680
Yes!

43:04.960 --> 43:06.320
Here we go, let's have a look.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.760
Bet you look good in a helmet.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.040
Oh, you don't. I am away.

43:16.680 --> 43:19.120
Are you in automatic or manual?

43:19.320 --> 43:21.360
Automatic. It will be slower.

43:26.120 --> 43:28.520
Whoa, there she goes.

43:28.680 --> 43:31.880
Right, through the tyres.
There we go. That is soaking wet.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.960
Yes, that was a bit fearful.
It's not a bad little car, though.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.440
This is really the one.

43:41.680 --> 43:46.520
This is where we had to put
 cones out for you because you
 couldn't see the white lines.

43:46.760 --> 43:50.000
Yep, there are the cones
to show you where to go.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.120
I can see why you made it
a 50 limit on the M4.

43:56.280 --> 44:00.160
You are allowed to go
faster than that on our track.

44:00.360 --> 44:02.760
Right, did you lift off?

44:03.040 --> 44:06.040
You did lift off.
I had my foot on the break then.

44:08.680 --> 44:11.760
It is hard to say how fast you are
going, it looks like a canal boat.

44:11.920 --> 44:15.400
Here we are coming up to
the second to last corner.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.360
It is a nice line in that.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.240
Very smooth, very well done.

44:19.480 --> 44:22.840
And Gambon got it right this time.
Ooh, little bit of tail coming out.

44:23.120 --> 44:26.320
Nicely held and there we are,
across the line.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.440
APPLAUSE

44:34.480 --> 44:39.360
Where do you think you've come on
this magnificent board? Bottom.

44:39.560 --> 44:40.720
Bottom?

44:40.800 --> 44:45.840
So, you're not even
going to try and get on
to Alastair Campbell, 1.47.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.280
It would be great to have beat him.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.160
No, you haven't.

44:49.440 --> 44:54.080
Well, John Prescott, you did it
in... What is the slowest time?

44:54.160 --> 44:57.840
1.53.7, effectively.

44:57.920 --> 45:00.480
You did it in one...

45:00.680 --> 45:05.360
56.7.

45:05.440 --> 45:10.640
Which is by far and away the
slowest lap time we have ever had.

45:10.680 --> 45:12.600
APPLAUSE

45:15.720 --> 45:18.120
It is amazing. Well, now...

45:22.000 --> 45:25.240
it has been very interesting...

45:25.440 --> 45:28.720
having you here today.
I'm very glad you came.

45:28.920 --> 45:31.040
It is something
 I thought would never happen

45:31.120 --> 45:34.160
and I think you are very brave to
come into in front of, what is,

45:34.240 --> 45:37.040
let's be honest, an audience
that's on my side, rightly so.

45:37.240 --> 45:40.360
Ladies and gentlemen, John Prescott.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.360
APPLAUSE

45:46.600 --> 45:48.600
Jezza versus Prezza, I like it.

45:49.600 --> 45:52.480
I thought it would
be an actual fight.

45:52.680 --> 45:56.720
Right, now, important moment because,
for the first time,

45:56.920 --> 46:00.800
I think, in two years,
we are going to do the Cool Wall!

46:00.840 --> 46:02.400
CHEERING

46:02.440 --> 46:03.600
Look, here it is.

46:06.520 --> 46:10.400
And straight away, we can see that
 currents have blown certain BMWs

46:10.560 --> 46:14.240
right up here into
 super cool, sub-zero.

46:14.640 --> 46:20.320
Things like the Z4, the M3,
the one series, the five series.
Not all Beamers, though.

46:20.480 --> 46:25.160
This one, the five series GT
 is down among the Audis. Uncool.

46:25.360 --> 46:28.160
That is a horrible thing.
It is like a fat old auntie,

46:28.240 --> 46:32.600
the one with terrible embarrassing
flatulence that nobody dares mention.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.320
Called Marjorie.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.040
Other changes.

46:36.360 --> 46:40.800
Down here, a clutch of superminis,
the actual Mini, Fiat 500,
the Citroen DS3.

46:41.040 --> 46:45.680
These are all inexpensive ways of
looking seriously cool. Good cars.

46:45.960 --> 46:48.960
Now, what do you make of this?
This is called the Nissan Juke.

46:49.160 --> 46:54.400
What is interesting, you buy
a car because you want something
which is practical or cheap.

46:54.640 --> 46:58.280
Or you want something fast.
 How many people do you know say,

46:58.320 --> 47:00.920
"I want to buy a car that
 is absolutely stupid?"

47:01.200 --> 47:05.880
Because that's what this is.
Do you not agree that is the
stupidest thing in the world?

47:06.000 --> 47:07.640
It is ugly. It is ugly.

47:07.880 --> 47:11.080
There is a chap back here,
you know your hat...

47:11.320 --> 47:13.640
LAUGHTER

47:13.720 --> 47:16.760
You obviously like
to go out in public

47:16.840 --> 47:18.600
looking ridiculous.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.680
Do you like the Nissan Juke?

47:20.760 --> 47:24.200
I don't mind it. What do you drive?-
A Golf.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.560
Not a diesel? It is a diesel, yes.

47:26.720 --> 47:29.560
You would look like that
and you've got a Golf diesel?

47:29.760 --> 47:31.600
That is fantastic.

47:31.720 --> 47:35.640
A blend of many things going
on there in that man's hat.

47:35.920 --> 47:40.520
This is a hideously uncool car so
 it goes down there.
What have you got there?

47:40.640 --> 47:44.960
This is the Renault Wind.
A couple of problems here,
first of all the name.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.440
Basically it is a Renault fart.
It is.

47:47.680 --> 47:54.000
I suspect that supercar-looking
body is writing cheques that the
rest of the car cannot cash.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.760
But, this is the Gordini version
so it has stripes on it.

47:58.040 --> 48:01.040
And, as we all know, things
with stripes on are cool,

48:01.240 --> 48:03.880
Shelby Mustangs, tigers,
toothpastes...

48:04.160 --> 48:06.440
James May's jumpers.
That is not cool.

48:06.560 --> 48:11.400
Thank you very much. It has stripes-
on it, it looks like James May's
knitwear so that goes there.

48:11.600 --> 48:15.280
Ahem. What? Check it out.

48:15.440 --> 48:18.320
What is it? Toyota Yaris Verso.

48:18.400 --> 48:22.240
It is not good. This is for people
whose lives are completely empty.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.120
They are looking forward
 to the day they die

48:25.200 --> 48:27.720
because it will give them
something to do.

48:28.080 --> 48:32.320
And they don't have sex any more
cos these days, you know,
we prefer sherry.

48:32.480 --> 48:36.800
They are utterly, utterly boring
and catastrophic in every single
 way and they have bought this

48:37.000 --> 48:40.440
and it is the worst car I've ever
seen in my life and it goes there.

48:40.640 --> 48:43.280
Crikey, getting that off your chest.-
One thing, has sherry ever lead
to sex? Do you get sherry sex?

48:50.400 --> 48:52.080
One thing, has sherry ever lead
to sex? Do you get sherry sex?

48:52.080 --> 48:53.880
I think you do.
It is the one alcoholic drink
that's never led to nooky.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.040
I will demonstrate sherry
sex to any volunteers.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.440
Could you volunteer to
have sherry sex with me?

48:57.720 --> 48:59.320
Oh, dear Lord.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.720
Just bear with me.
You don't have to go very far.

49:01.960 --> 49:03.600
She is keen. Sherry sex.

49:03.800 --> 49:05.240
Here we go.

49:05.440 --> 49:07.880
Good night.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.320
Sherry sex, like that.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.120
APPLAUSE

49:12.360 --> 49:15.920
Thank you. I need a cigarette now.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.040
LAUGHTER

49:17.240 --> 49:19.320
And now we have got
a problem with this.

49:19.440 --> 49:23.120
This is the Porsche 911 Carrera C2S.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.920
We know the rules on the Cool Wall.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.720
If one of us has a car,
it is always uncool.

49:27.960 --> 49:30.840
Both Hammond and May own this car.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.680
I don't think the board
is long enough

49:33.800 --> 49:35.920
to be able to accommodate that.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.320
I'm just trying to work out
the direction.

49:38.440 --> 49:41.440
That is east, that is west.
Who lives west of here?

49:41.600 --> 49:43.440
Where do you live? Wiltshire.

49:43.760 --> 49:46.680
Does anybody live
 further west than Wiltshire?

49:46.960 --> 49:51.960
Ireland. Ireland?
Excellent! Could you do me a
favour?

49:52.120 --> 49:55.200
Could you take that home
 and pop it on your gatepost?

49:56.440 --> 49:58.840
Thank you very much, it will
live there for ever more.

49:58.920 --> 50:01.440
Those are the rules,
I can't argue with that.

50:01.520 --> 50:05.960
I would like to proffer this. OK?

50:06.200 --> 50:08.800
What is it? It is a Morgan.
The new Morgan three-wheeler.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.880
New? Yes, they are recreating
the three-wheeler runabout

50:11.960 --> 50:14.920
that launched the company
100 years ago and it is magnificent.

50:15.120 --> 50:18.360
It is made with aluminium and it is
a modern re-creation. No, it isn't.

50:18.560 --> 50:20.080
It isn't modern anything. Yes it is.

50:20.200 --> 50:23.840
It is modernised. No, you
know everybody will have this, OK?

50:23.880 --> 50:26.440
You know the cupboard under your
sink, OK, which is full

50:26.520 --> 50:29.520
of wedding presents you never used,-
you're all familiar with that?

50:29.640 --> 50:31.560
That is the fish steamer
you were given.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.000
It is. It isn't. It is.

50:36.040 --> 50:38.000
It isn't. It is.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.480
Well, it isn't.

50:39.720 --> 50:42.520
If you put that in cool,
I will put you in a drain.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.200
I have a chair and I
am not afraid to use it.

50:48.400 --> 50:50.880
I have a hammer.

50:51.160 --> 50:54.600
Well, make your move, big
fella, it is going in cool.

50:54.720 --> 50:56.120
Make your move, come on.

50:56.400 --> 50:58.360
You know what this is, don't you?

50:58.400 --> 51:01.000
Awkward. This is a Mexican stand-off.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.120
LAUGHTER

51:02.400 --> 51:06.280
Right, it is now time for a
small celebration, because

51:06.440 --> 51:11.800
this year marks the 40th birthday
of the world's most expensive car.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.520
Operating. We're underway.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.560
It had no doors.

51:23.720 --> 51:27.200
No roof. No windscreen.

51:27.400 --> 51:30.240
It produced just one horse power

51:30.480 --> 51:34.920
and it had a couple of
garden chairs for seats.

51:35.120 --> 51:41.000
And yet, the Lunar Rover,
or moon buggy, cost £25 million

51:41.080 --> 51:47.520
and that was in 1971 when a V12
E-type Jag cost less than £3,500.

51:47.720 --> 51:51.400
In its short life, the moon buggy
covered just 56 miles,

51:51.480 --> 51:56.240
which in Top Gear maths works out
as about £500,000 per mile.

51:56.440 --> 51:58.680
Although they were all on the moon.

51:58.760 --> 52:00.320
You are go!

52:00.440 --> 52:04.800
The moon buggy was used
in three space missions.

52:04.920 --> 52:08.680
Man, oh man,
what a Grand Prix this is.

52:08.880 --> 52:12.720
I tell you, it sure does a good
job with this kind of terrain.

52:12.800 --> 52:15.440
And the short,
bouncy journeys it made

52:15.560 --> 52:19.000
were about the most useful
a car has ever undertaken.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.680
The moon buggy meant that the
astronauts could explore

52:23.880 --> 52:26.520
more of the moon than they would
have been able to on foot,

52:26.760 --> 52:30.040
and that meant they could take
more pictures, collect more rocks,

52:30.320 --> 52:34.600
drill for more samples
and generally get
 a better understanding

52:34.880 --> 52:37.480
of where the universe
 may have come from.

52:37.720 --> 52:41.160
However, in 1972
the moon missions were scrapped,

52:41.360 --> 52:45.400
which means that for the last
 39 years, the only moon buggy

52:45.440 --> 52:48.680
you will have seen on earth
has been in a museum.

52:51.520 --> 52:53.280
Until now.

52:57.120 --> 53:00.840
Because... Yes, it's back.

53:13.040 --> 53:16.080
This really is it.

53:16.160 --> 53:18.120
The Moon Buggy Mark II.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.360
A car for outer space.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.240
This is much more exciting

53:22.400 --> 53:25.680
than something like a
Veyron SS or a Ferrari 458.

53:25.840 --> 53:28.360
Those are just earth cars.

53:28.600 --> 53:33.560
And because I am the one who goes
by the name of Captain Buzz Slow,

53:33.600 --> 53:36.240
NASA have said I can drive it.

53:43.680 --> 53:49.440
There we are, we are flat out in
the Lunar Rover Mark II,
that is 10 miles an hour.

53:49.600 --> 53:53.200
The original Lunar Rover did eight
miles an hour until the astronauts

53:53.480 --> 53:55.800
got hold of it and they managed
to push it up to 11.

53:56.080 --> 53:58.120
So, who knows,
this could get into the teens.

53:59.800 --> 54:02.600
I can't believe I am
being allowed to do this.

54:02.800 --> 54:04.440
I am alone in it.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.880
Well, almost alone.

54:07.120 --> 54:09.640
Since Moon Buggy Mark II
 cost $4.5 million,

54:09.720 --> 54:13.160
there was a car behind me
 containing some NASA heavies

54:13.200 --> 54:16.840
who could remotely shut it down
if I did anything stupid.

54:18.080 --> 54:20.680
Absolutely fantastic control
interface here.

54:20.880 --> 54:23.920
I have got this screen with touch
 buttons, loads of parameters

54:23.960 --> 54:26.600
I can fiddle with,
every single wheel is monitored.

54:26.840 --> 54:30.520
My heading, my direction,
roll, pitch, all these things.

54:30.840 --> 54:35.120
If normal cars were as
complicated as this, they
would be a lot more fun.

54:35.280 --> 54:39.000
Watch this for a really brilliant
little Lunar Rover party trick.

54:39.320 --> 54:42.200
If I just push the joystick
to the side, very slightly,

54:42.240 --> 54:46.320
you will see that is not
turning right, that is crabbing.

54:46.560 --> 54:47.440
How about that?

54:47.480 --> 54:49.440
SCREECHING

54:50.760 --> 54:52.160
What was that?

54:55.440 --> 54:56.920
Am I that close to it?

54:58.640 --> 55:00.400
Sorry.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.360
After an astronomical rollicking,

55:04.480 --> 55:07.440
I decided to concentrate on
moon buggy pub trivia.

55:08.680 --> 55:12.960
This is the only vehicle of
any type I have ever driven
with two quoted weights,

55:13.200 --> 55:16.200
because here on earth it weighs
approximately four tonnes

55:16.480 --> 55:19.600
but on the moon, of course,
the gravity is only about a sixth

55:19.680 --> 55:23.360
of what we have here, so it only
weighs something like 760 kilograms.

55:23.440 --> 55:25.480
They do have to think about
 that sort of thing.

55:25.720 --> 55:30.560
It will behave differently
and your sensors will
behave differently as well.

55:30.680 --> 55:34.000
The moon buggy has 12 wheels.

55:34.240 --> 55:39.120
Powered by six motors
and they have a great party piece.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.120
Right, watch this.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.400
We are now crabbing

55:47.560 --> 55:50.440
exactly sideways.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.920
The Eagle has parked.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.320
BANG

55:55.320 --> 55:56.560
Sorry.

55:56.760 --> 55:59.000
Now, we have done a small
amount of maths here.

55:59.080 --> 56:01.120
This is proper maths,
 not Top Gear maths.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.080
We worked out that if every car
in Britain could park like that

56:04.280 --> 56:07.720
and didn't have to leave
 a gap at each end,

56:07.920 --> 56:09.600
we would save, wait for it...

56:09.760 --> 56:12.480
10,000 miles of parking space.

56:13.600 --> 56:17.120
But since there is not really a
problem with parking on the moon,

56:17.400 --> 56:20.600
those wheels, combined with
an adjustable ride height

56:20.760 --> 56:23.800
are designed primarily
to be amazing off-road.

56:25.880 --> 56:28.040
Houston, we are go for rocks.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.160
Now, you'll see when
you're looking outside,

56:33.240 --> 56:36.400
each wheel set is working out where-
it's going and what it's doing,

56:36.560 --> 56:38.920
sort out the right height,
deal with the traction,

56:39.200 --> 56:42.480
it is extremely intelligent,
it has extremely powerful computers.

56:42.680 --> 56:45.720
The tyres themselves are
not quite so hi-tech.

56:45.960 --> 56:50.200
They were chosen
for their toughness and
are from a crop sprayer.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.440
Look at this!

56:55.680 --> 56:57.240
That's bags of torque.

56:57.320 --> 57:01.680
It is a four-ton vehicle
climbing up a 30 degree slope.

57:01.760 --> 57:04.000
What a climb!

57:04.280 --> 57:07.440
What a ride!

57:07.520 --> 57:09.800
It is absolutely brilliant,
 this thing.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.480
ENGINE STALLS

57:11.720 --> 57:13.560
Sorry.

57:15.200 --> 57:20.040
It is not just the moon buggy's
off-road abilities that
have moved on either.

57:20.280 --> 57:23.840
The original Lunar Rover
had a very limited range

57:23.960 --> 57:31.120
because if it broke down, the
astronauts had to be able to make
it back to the lunar module on foot.

57:32.960 --> 57:37.240
But this one
is more of a cosmic camper van.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.520
This is a space bed.

57:39.760 --> 57:42.400
There is another one that
folds down here for your buddy.

57:42.520 --> 57:45.400
They are covered in memory foam,
which was a NASA invention.

57:45.440 --> 57:49.280
There are privacy curtains here,
there is an iPod dock,

57:49.520 --> 57:52.560
there is a home cinema,
here is a space John.

57:52.720 --> 57:56.400
But sooner or later, you are going
to get bored watching Apollo 13

57:56.600 --> 57:59.040
and you might want to go
 for a walk outside.

57:59.080 --> 58:04.040
If you do, you have to exit through-
 the rather unusual back door.

58:04.120 --> 58:09.200
Here we go.
My feet are entering the suit.

58:09.320 --> 58:14.680
My gentleman's area is compressed
by the crotch of the spacesuit.

58:16.520 --> 58:19.560
I have my hands in the space suit.

58:19.600 --> 58:22.200
Leak check complete.

58:22.440 --> 58:25.440
Closing the hatch
 in the Lunar Rover.

58:30.320 --> 58:35.000
That is quite a giant leap
for a very unsteady man.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.640
I would now like to
perform a short tribute

58:38.760 --> 58:41.400
to the late Alan Shepard Junior,

58:41.680 --> 58:45.360
one of only 12 men
to have walked on the moon,

58:45.480 --> 58:48.120
and the only man to have done this.

58:51.240 --> 58:54.080
Houston,
the Eagle is going for a birdie.

58:58.760 --> 58:59.760
There we go.

59:01.480 --> 59:03.240
Miles and miles and miles.

59:07.640 --> 59:10.120
I'd like to be deadly
serious for a moment.

59:10.360 --> 59:15.440
This is the most fabulous vehicle
I have ever driven. Ever.

59:15.640 --> 59:17.440
But there is a problem with it.

59:17.560 --> 59:20.840
Not a technical problem,
it is the President.

59:20.880 --> 59:24.960
He has cancelled all the
funding for the next moon mission.

59:26.200 --> 59:28.440
Because that is what
makes the ship go up.

59:28.600 --> 59:32.080
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

59:34.520 --> 59:38.160
That means, if you're a kid,
you will never have the thrill

59:38.360 --> 59:41.480
of getting up in the middle
of the night, like I did,

59:41.600 --> 59:45.280
to watch the funny little car
hooning about on the moon.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.720
Yahoo!

59:47.840 --> 59:50.360
That was all four wheels
off the ground there.

59:50.440 --> 59:53.600
This is really some machine.

59:53.680 --> 59:59.760
This piece of film I am watching
now shows men leaving the surface
of the moon for the last time.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:06.800
That is the ascent stage of the
Apollo 17 lunar module blasting off-
from the lunar surface.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.040
That bit of film was captured
with a remote camera
mounted on the moon buggy.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.280
Which means, obviously,
that the moon buggy was left behind.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.760
It does make me sort of sad, really,
to think of that amazing car

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.920
being left up there,
gathering moon dust for eternity.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.160
But if you ask me, it is not
half as sad as a moon buggy

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.200
that will never go up there at all.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.480
APPLAUSE

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.680
I understand the
financial considerations,

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.600
but it is sad, isn't it?
Yes, it makes me sad.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.040
I tell you what else is sad.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.680
That is not only the end of this
show, it is the end of this series.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.920
Thank you very much for
watching, though,

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.560
we will see you again in June.
Take care. Goodnight.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.120
