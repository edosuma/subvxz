WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:02.395
- Previously on Hannibal...
- You know and I know it's

00:02.430 --> 00:05.661
the best way to bait him.
- So I really bad-mouth

00:05.700 --> 00:08.737
the Red Dragon in Tattle Crime.
- It'd feel like a trap to me.

00:08.770 --> 00:13.776
- I have blasphemed against
the dragon. There is much
for you to dread.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.071
- You orchestrated his end,
Alana.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.342
- I am the Dragon.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.188
Get up.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.529
Stand by the bed.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.391
Do you know where
you are in the room?

00:37.400 --> 00:40.790
And you know where
you are in the house?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.768
Then you know

00:43.810 --> 00:46.608
where the front door is,
don't you?

00:52.420 --> 00:54.638
Reba,

00:54.680 --> 00:56.739
feel on my chest.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.823
Bring your hands
up slowly. Don't!

01:06.860 --> 01:09.567
...do what you're thinking.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.538
Just feel on my chest.

01:13.570 --> 01:15.538
(zipper undoing)

01:15.570 --> 01:18.664
Just around my throat.
You feel that?

01:18.710 --> 01:21.531
It's a key.

01:21.580 --> 01:24.140
Take it off over my head.

01:24.180 --> 01:26.171
Careful.

01:28.180 --> 01:29.716
Now...

01:32.860 --> 01:34.851
I'm going to see
if I can trust you.

01:36.860 --> 01:39.829
Go to the front door, lock it.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.827
Go ahead.

01:44.870 --> 01:48.192
I'll wait right here.
(whimpering)

01:51.710 --> 01:53.871
Don't try to run.

01:57.750 --> 02:01.174
I can catch you.

02:01.220 --> 02:04.587
(clock continuously ticking)

02:34.480 --> 02:35.469
- Ah!

02:40.490 --> 02:42.481
- Oh, Reba.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.836
Now lock the door

02:53.870 --> 02:57.237
and put the key around my neck.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.571
Hang it around my neck.

03:08.520 --> 03:12.308
_Now let's make sure
It's locked, shall we?

03:12.360 --> 03:15.284
(rattling)
Very good.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.853
Now go on back to the bedroom.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.521
You know the way.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.841
Sit down.

03:41.850 --> 03:44.614
And sit still

03:44.650 --> 03:46.982
or I can't keep Him off you.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.215
- Please try.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.491
- Put out your hand.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.336
Feel this.

04:02.370 --> 04:05.737
Don't grab it, feel it.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.300
It's a shotgun.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.871
(gasping)

04:19.050 --> 04:21.257
Take your hand down.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.957
I wish I could have trusted you.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.491
I wanted to trust you.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.034
You felt so good.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.335
- (crying): So did you, D.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.905
I love it.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.646
Please don't hurt me now.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.286
(gasping)

05:01.930 --> 05:04.694
(clanging)

05:07.440 --> 05:09.806
I can't give you to Him.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.058
You know what He will do.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.949
- No...no, no, no, no...

05:16.980 --> 05:18.971
- He will bite you.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.091
Better you go with me.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.530
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:41.570 --> 05:44.698
(escalating screaming)

05:49.110 --> 05:51.499
(crying)

05:51.550 --> 05:52.972
Oh God, no...

05:53.020 --> 05:55.614
- Oh, Reba...

05:55.650 --> 05:58.949
I can't stand to watch you burn.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.912
(screaming)

06:03.890 --> 06:05.858
(gun co
ck'
- No! Ing)

06:05.890 --> 06:07.892
(gunshot)

06:14.970 --> 06:17.700
(gasping)

06:37.490 --> 06:41.119
(distorted piano plays)

06:50.010 --> 06:53.502
(theme music)

07:22.100 --> 07:24.466
He shot himself in the face.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.742
I put my hand in it.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.670
He set fire to the house.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.215
He shot himself.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.810
I put my hand in it.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.828
(whispering): He was on the...

07:43.860 --> 07:46.829
the floor...

07:50.670 --> 07:53.662
- I won't put you
through this again,

07:53.700 --> 07:55.668
but...

07:55.700 --> 07:57.509
I'd like to come back by.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.906
Just to say hi and see
how you're doing.

07:59.940 --> 08:02.135
- How could you help it?

08:02.180 --> 08:04.171
A charmer like me.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.290
- In the end,
he couldn't kill you

08:22.330 --> 08:25.720
and he couldn't watch you die.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.267
The people who study this kind
of thing say that he was trying

08:30.310 --> 08:34.303
to stop because you helped him.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.979
Probably saved some lives.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.978
- I drew a freak.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.240
- You didn't draw a freak.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.818
You drew a man

08:44.850 --> 08:47.080
with a freak on his back.

08:49.590 --> 08:52.718
There is nothing wrong with you.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.991
- I know there's nothing
wrong with me.

08:56.030 --> 08:59.124
In making friends,
I try to be wary of people

08:59.170 --> 09:01.138
who foster dependency

09:01.170 --> 09:03.764
and feed on it.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.229
I've been with a few.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.271
The blind attract them.

09:14.150 --> 09:16.880
- Not just the blind.

09:24.630 --> 09:27.155
(ominous music)

09:48.380 --> 09:51.588
Ding-dong, the Dragon's dead.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.128
- Are congratulations in order?

10:01.160 --> 10:03.128
- I didn't kill him.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.161
Suicide.

10:10.440 --> 10:14.308
- Then he wasn't as strong
as the Dragon after all.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.979
- He was trying to stop.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.210
- I was rooting for you, Will.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.889
It's a shame.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.218
You came all this way

10:29.260 --> 10:31.251
and you didn't get
to kill anybody.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.021
Only consolation
is Dr. Chilton.

10:39.230 --> 10:41.835
Congratulations for
the job you did on him.

10:41.870 --> 10:44.634
I admired it enormously.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.672
What a cunning boy you are.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.948
- Are you accusing me
of something?

10:53.980 --> 10:56.710
- Does the enemy inside you

10:56.750 --> 10:59.048
agree with the accusation?

10:59.090 --> 11:02.150
Even a little bit?

11:02.190 --> 11:05.318
- I came back
to stop the Dragon.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.360
He's stopped.

11:13.370 --> 11:16.089
- Your family
was on his itinerary.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.131
Safe now.

11:19.810 --> 11:22.699
You can go home again.
If there's any point.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.116
Is there any point?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.311
- I like my life there.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.311
- It won't be the same.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.389
You'll see it's not the same.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.321
The unspoken knowledge
will live with you,

11:44.370 --> 11:46.497
like unwanted company
in the house.

11:46.530 --> 11:49.135
- Molly and I want it
to be the same.

11:52.140 --> 11:54.233
- When life becomes
maddeningly polite...

11:56.540 --> 11:58.747
...think about me.

12:01.150 --> 12:03.345
Think about me, Will,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.381
don't worry about me.

12:20.270 --> 12:23.467
(sighing)

12:23.510 --> 12:26.434
- You turned yourself in

12:26.470 --> 12:29.200
so I would always know
where you were.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.988
You'd only do that

12:37.020 --> 12:39.488
ifI rejected you.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.993
Goodbye.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.830
- Will...

12:58.410 --> 13:00.833
Was it good to see me?

13:02.280 --> 13:05.545
- Good?

13:05.580 --> 13:06.808
No.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.159
(loud bang)

13:31.240 --> 13:33.231
(strangling sounds)

13:42.250 --> 13:45.378
(water splashing)
(gasping)

13:51.630 --> 13:54.849
- Do you think you can sit up?

13:54.900 --> 13:57.027
Try to sit up.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.508
- You didn't break my back.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.308
- Your face

14:12.350 --> 14:15.319
is closed to me.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.411
- IfI can see you...

14:23.960 --> 14:26.485
...YOU can see me.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.918
- You think you understand,
don't you?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.096
- "I understand

14:35.140 --> 14:37.506
"that blood and breath...

14:39.640 --> 14:42.200
"...are only elements
undergoing change

14:42.240 --> 14:45.243
to fuel your Radiance."

14:47.980 --> 14:50.619
Hannibal said those words.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.481
To me.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.620
- I wanted to share with Lecter,

14:58.660 --> 15:02.221
and Lecter betrayed me.

15:04.230 --> 15:07.131
- He betrayed me, too.

15:07.170 --> 15:10.560
- I would like to share.

15:15.010 --> 15:19.071
- You shared

15:19.110 --> 15:21.943
with Reba.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.641
- I shared with Reba

15:23.690 --> 15:25.646
a little,

15:25.690 --> 15:28.079
in a way that she could survive.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.657
- But you didn't change her.

15:30.690 --> 15:33.989
- I chose not to change her.

15:34.030 --> 15:37.158
I'm stronger
than the Dragon now.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.107
- Hannibal Lecter

15:43.140 --> 15:46.234
is who you need to change.

15:50.510 --> 15:53.274
- I want to meet Lecter.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.073
How would I manage that?

16:02.020 --> 16:05.979
- The only teeth we found in the
skull were Grandma's dentures.

16:06.030 --> 16:09.295
- And the upper part was
made of vulcanite instead
of acrylic like they use today.

16:09.330 --> 16:11.594
No one's _ma_de vulcanite
plates In fifty years.

16:11.630 --> 16:14.030
- Dolarhyde had
a new acrylic set

16:14.070 --> 16:16.664
just like it made to fit him.
Chinese manufacturer.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.168
The new pair we found
on the body.

16:19.210 --> 16:22.407
Grandma's old yucky pair
we found in his mouth.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.408
- Well, not his mouth, per se.
We think it's a guy

16:24.450 --> 16:26.577
named Arnold Lang--
he's missing.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.044
Worked at a service station
near Dolarhyde.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.344
Found his car,
but it had been wiped clean.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.551
- So Dolarhyde snuffs out Lang,

16:33.590 --> 16:37.128
takes the dead body back
to the house, then does this
whole thing with the blind lady,

16:37.160 --> 16:39.549
song and dance, "Will I shoot
you? Won't I shoot you?

16:39.590 --> 16:41.751
I don't know."
- "I can't stand to see you
burn. Boo hoo!" And then blows

16:41.800 --> 16:44.189
Lang's head away
with a twelve-gauge.

16:44.230 --> 16:48.030
- So the routine of hanging
the key around his neck was
to be sure she felt the body.

16:48.070 --> 16:50.038
So she could tell us

16:50.070 --> 16:52.607
she certainly felt a body.

16:52.640 --> 16:56.132
- The Great Red Dragon lives.

16:56.180 --> 17:00.776
The obvious thing
is to get him to come to us.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.048
Bait him with something

17:02.080 --> 17:04.480
he wants more than me.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.488
- He'd have to be an idiot
to go for it.

17:06.520 --> 17:10.286
- I know. Want to hear what
the best bait would be?

17:10.330 --> 17:12.628
- I'm not sure I want to.

17:12.660 --> 17:16.448
- Hannibal would
be the best bait.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.398
- Why in God's name

17:17.430 --> 17:19.364
would anyone want to meet
Hannibal Lecter?

17:19.400 --> 17:22.597
- To kill him, Jack.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.336
The Dragon could
absorb him that way,

17:25.370 --> 17:29.170
engulf him, become
more than he is.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.540
- You sound pretty sure.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.548
- I'm not sure.

17:36.580 --> 17:38.719
Who's sure?

17:38.750 --> 17:41.389
I'm not even sure Hannibal
would draw the Dragon.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.651
I just say that
it's our best shot.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.055
- Set him up how?

17:51.870 --> 17:54.236
- We take Hannibal
into federal custody.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.830
We fake an escape.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.113
(liquid splashing)

18:20.930 --> 18:25.264
- We assign a moment
to decision.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.336
What you propose

18:27.370 --> 18:30.533
is so thoughtless...

18:32.940 --> 18:35.135
I find it difficult to imagine

18:35.180 --> 18:37.808
that moment exists.
- Decnsrons

18:37.850 --> 18:40.671
are made of kneaded feelings.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.115
They're more often
a lump than a sum.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.928
- However you think

18:50.960 --> 18:53.622
you're going to manipulate

18:53.660 --> 18:56.424
this situation
to your advantage,

18:58.430 --> 19:02.161
think again.
- There is no advantage.

19:03.970 --> 19:07.929
It's all degrees
of disadvantage.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.448
_ "Who holds the Devil,

19:10.480 --> 19:12.573
"let him hold him well.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.942
"He will hardly

19:14.980 --> 19:17.778
be caught a second time."

19:17.820 --> 19:20.311
- (whispering):
I don't intend Hannibal

19:20.360 --> 19:23.386
to be caught a second time.

19:26.830 --> 19:29.355
- Can't live with him.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.391
Can't live without him.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.395
Is that what this is?

19:36.440 --> 19:39.637
- I guess

19:39.670 --> 19:41.638
this is

19:41.680 --> 19:44.569
my Becoming.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.578
- What you are "becoming"

19:46.610 --> 19:49.374
is pathological.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.718
- Extreme acts of cruelty

19:51.750 --> 19:55.789
require a high degree
of empathy.

19:57.790 --> 20:00.395
- You've just found religion.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.557
Nothing more dangerous
than that.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.760
- I'd pack my bags
ifI were you, Bedelia.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.973
Meat's back on the menu.

20:16.610 --> 20:18.942
- You righteous, reckless,

20:18.980 --> 20:21.278
twitchy little man.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.413
He might as well cut
all of our throats

20:23.450 --> 20:26.442
and be done with it.

20:26.490 --> 20:29.584
- Ready or not.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.656
Here he comes.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.781
- Dr. Bloom.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.751
You finally broke down
and came to visit.

21:03.790 --> 21:05.883
Your face

21:05.930 --> 21:09.354
did not change at all

21:09.400 --> 21:11.595
when you first looked at me.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.535
Shock, in seeing me,

21:16.570 --> 21:20.973
is usually delayed.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.005
- I wanted to see you,
Frederick.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.848
I wanted to remind myself

21:29.880 --> 21:32.041
what Hannibal is capable of.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.718
- What Hannibal is capable of.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.979
What Will Graham is capable of.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.068
What you

21:44.100 --> 21:46.295
are capable of.

21:47.670 --> 21:48.864
You

21:48.900 --> 21:52.063
were the roper.

21:52.110 --> 21:54.328
Too bad there
was not enough rope

21:54.380 --> 21:57.907
for you to hang yourself with.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.748
Just enough

22:00.780 --> 22:04.011
to hang me.

22:04.050 --> 22:06.484
Who does Will Graham

22:06.520 --> 22:08.852
have you roping now?

22:12.390 --> 22:14.358
- Hannibal.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.527
(strained laughing)

22:19.600 --> 22:21.932
- Tethers, if I had them,

22:21.970 --> 22:24.461
I would burn the man alive.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.798
Though,

22:29.840 --> 22:32.047
maybe I would rather

22:32.080 --> 22:34.742
have his skin.

22:34.780 --> 22:38.841
I've been getting grafts.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.915
How I would love to count

22:40.960 --> 22:44.851
Hannibal among my donors.

22:44.890 --> 22:47.393
- You were never comfortable

22:47.430 --> 22:49.557
in your own skin, Frederick.

22:50.870 --> 22:55.762
You wouldn't be comfortable
in Hannibal's.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.360
- Are you?

23:12.720 --> 23:15.188
- There's a deal for you,
Hannibal.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.688
Or there could be.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.097
- A deal? With whom?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.862
- The FBI.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.661
- Jack couldn't ask me himself?

23:29.700 --> 23:32.168
- Jack doesn't know you
as well as I do.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.771
He thought if he asked you
for help, you would just
torment him.

23:35.810 --> 23:39.678
- Quite right, too.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.746
How wise of Jack.

23:43.620 --> 23:46.509
- The Red Dragon faked
his death.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.984
- Good for him.

23:49.020 --> 23:51.955
- Jack wants to fake
your escape.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.121
I release you
into police custody.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.095
And Jack uses you as bait.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.809
- Was it Will's idea?

24:05.770 --> 24:07.738
- Yes.

24:07.780 --> 24:12.001
- Yes. That worked out so well
for Frederick Chilton.

24:12.050 --> 24:14.871
Do please tell Frederick,

24:14.920 --> 24:17.718
if you see him,
I wish a speedy convalescence

24:17.750 --> 24:19.809
and hope he won't be very ugly.

24:22.020 --> 24:25.023
- I've been on the phone
for hours on your behalf,
and this is what you get--

24:25.060 --> 24:27.528
- Any rational society
would either kill me

24:27.560 --> 24:30.222
or give me my books.

24:33.670 --> 24:36.264
- If you cooperate in the
capture of Francis Dolarhyde,

24:36.300 --> 24:38.268
you get your books,

24:38.310 --> 24:41.632
your drawings. Your toilet.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.103
All privileges
will be restored.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.870
- You trust Will
with my well-being?

24:52.620 --> 24:55.054
- As much as I trust you
with his.

24:57.890 --> 24:59.858
- You trust me with yours?

24:59.890 --> 25:03.724
You intend to release me
Into police custody.

25:03.770 --> 25:06.489
Police are not
as wnse as you are.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.561
I might escape in earnest

25:11.610 --> 25:13.931
and come to kill you.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.541
- First chance you get,
I assume.

25:17.580 --> 25:20.777
- You died in my kitchen, Alana,

25:20.820 --> 25:24.586
when you chose to be brave.

25:24.620 --> 25:28.511
Every moment since is borrowed.

25:30.290 --> 25:32.656
Your wife...

25:32.690 --> 25:35.625
your child...

25:35.660 --> 25:38.561
they belong to me.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.034
We made a bargain
for Will's life,

25:41.070 --> 25:43.800
and then I spun you gold.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.945
- Hannibal has tentatively

25:54.980 --> 25:57.141
agreed to the deal, as proposed.

25:58.350 --> 26:01.683
- What will it take
to make him less tentative?

26:01.720 --> 26:04.985
- He wants Will to ask him.

26:05.030 --> 26:08.124
And he wants you
to say "please."

26:08.160 --> 26:10.720
- I'll say "pretty please."

26:14.300 --> 26:16.962
- Well, people
are going to stampede

26:17.000 --> 26:18.968
if they think
that Lecter is out.

26:19.010 --> 26:21.877
- Let them stampede.

26:21.910 --> 26:24.140
Authenticity.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.875
And let them believe

26:25.910 --> 26:28.674
I helped Hannibal escape.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.216
- Authenticity?

26:33.250 --> 26:36.287
- Someone has to be close.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.357
When the Dragon comes.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.291
- And then?

26:43.870 --> 26:48.136
- We kill Dolarhyde.

26:48.170 --> 26:51.662
And then

26:51.710 --> 26:53.632
we kill Hannibal.

26:57.710 --> 26:59.701
- To the Devil his due.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.108
- I thought you said
your good-byes.

27:07.150 --> 27:09.289
- We've one last good-bye
between us.

27:09.320 --> 27:12.653
- You didn't just say good-bye,
though, did you?

27:14.960 --> 27:18.259
That little extra bit
at the end.

27:18.300 --> 27:20.291
What was that you said?

27:22.870 --> 27:25.862
- You'd never_ have turned
yourself In unless
I rejected you.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.128
- Yes. That extra bit.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.204
I believe that's what
they call a "mic drop."

27:33.250 --> 27:36.708
You dropped the mic, Will,
but here you are

27:36.750 --> 27:39.446
having to come back
and pick it up again.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.981
- I knew you would keep running

27:42.020 --> 27:44.989
ifI kept chasing you.

27:45.030 --> 27:48.158
I knew you wanted me to know
exactly where I could find you

27:48.200 --> 27:50.156
when I needed to.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.361
- And you did.

27:55.770 --> 27:59.968
- I need you, Hannibal.

28:00.010 --> 28:00.533
- Ding-dong.

28:00.570 --> 28:03.471
The Dragon's not dead.

28:03.510 --> 28:06.877
- He told you he wanted
to meet you. Maybe that
was a serious invitation.

28:06.910 --> 28:10.016
After the big escape,

28:10.050 --> 28:12.211
you send a message to the Dragon
in the personal ads,

28:12.250 --> 28:16.186
ask him for a rendezvous.
- He won't go near a mall drop.

28:16.220 --> 28:19.223
- He might be curious enough
to look at one, see if
you sold him.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.228
We chose a drop

28:21.260 --> 28:23.763
that can be watched only
from a few places

28:23.800 --> 28:26.166
from a long way off,

28:26.200 --> 28:28.430
and we'll stake out
the observation points.

28:31.910 --> 28:36.176
- It sounds weak to you,
even as you say it.

28:36.210 --> 28:38.371
- Secret Service has a setup
they've never used.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.401
They'll let us have it.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.947
You're our best shot, Hannibal.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.221
Please.

29:17.180 --> 29:21.150
(sirens)

29:36.400 --> 29:38.368
(tires screeching)

29:38.410 --> 29:40.503
(banging and crashing)

29:45.010 --> 29:47.945
(warped sirens)

29:56.890 --> 29:59.484
(muffled gunshot)

30:04.500 --> 30:06.491
(muffled gunshot)

30:33.090 --> 30:35.422
- He's not going
to kill us here.

30:35.460 --> 30:38.861
What he wants to do requires
something a little more private.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.068
- What are you doing?

30:43.100 --> 30:46.103
- You know, Will,
you worry too much.

30:46.140 --> 30:49.132
(distant tires screeching)

30:49.180 --> 30:50.909
You'd be much more comfortable

30:50.950 --> 30:53.145
if you relaxed with yourself.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.392
Going my way?

31:13.430 --> 31:16.160
***

32:25.140 --> 32:28.132
(waves crashing)

32:31.750 --> 32:33.945
The bluff is eroding.

32:36.350 --> 32:38.739
There was more land
when I was here with Abigail.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.009
More land still when
I was here with Miriam Lass.

32:47.030 --> 32:50.022
- Now you're here with me.

32:50.060 --> 32:52.062
- And the bluff
is still eroding.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.289
You and I are suspended
over the roiling Atlantic.

32:57.340 --> 33:01.333
Soon all of this
will be lost to the sea.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.980
(gentle piano plays)

33:23.660 --> 33:30.099
You're playing games with
yourself in the dark
of the moon.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.630
Wasn't surprising that I heard

33:31.670 --> 33:33.661
from the Great Red Dragon.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.708
Was it surprising
when you heard from him?

33:44.190 --> 33:46.181
- Yes and no.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.224
- Do you intend
to watch him kill me?

33:56.230 --> 33:58.494
- I intend to watch him
change you.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.366
- My compassion for you

34:06.410 --> 34:09.174
is inconvenient, Will.

34:09.210 --> 34:12.247
- If you're partial
to beef products,

34:12.280 --> 34:16.239
it is inconvenient to be
compassnonate toward a cow.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.718
- Save yourself, kill them all?

34:37.700 --> 34:39.702
- I don't know
ifI can save myself.

34:42.780 --> 34:45.408
Maybe that's just fine.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.151
for a friend."

35:03.430 --> 35:06.524
- He's watching us now.
- I know.

35:08.770 --> 35:10.795
(gunshot)

35:18.710 --> 35:20.769
(smashing)

35:31.390 --> 35:34.689
- Don't run. I'll catch you.

35:39.370 --> 35:41.838
(heavy breathing)

35:41.870 --> 35:43.895
- Hello, Francis.

35:45.910 --> 35:48.401
- Hello, Dr. Lecter.

35:52.510 --> 35:55.809
- I'm so happy you chose life,
Francis.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.881
Suicide is the enemy.

36:04.430 --> 36:08.423
You were seized
by a fantasy world

36:10.360 --> 36:13.625
with the brilliance and

36:13.670 --> 36:17.492
freshness and immediacy
of childhood.

36:19.810 --> 36:22.631
It took you a step beyond alone.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.979
- I'm going to film your death,

36:26.010 --> 36:28.217
Dr. Lecter,

36:31.990 --> 36:35.209
as dying,

36:35.260 --> 36:37.888
you meld with the strength
of the Dragon.

36:40.460 --> 36:45.193
- It's a glorious and rather
discomforting idea.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.935
- Watching the film

36:49.970 --> 36:52.734
will be wonderful,

36:52.770 --> 36:55.876
but not as wonderful
as the act itself.

36:57.980 --> 37:00.540
(dramatic drums)

37:04.020 --> 37:06.682
(grunting)

37:06.720 --> 37:10.554
(gasping)

37:31.040 --> 37:33.543
(grunting)

37:52.430 --> 37:55.331
(grunting)

38:04.410 --> 38:05.741
(yelling)

38:13.520 --> 38:17.411
(mellow music plays)

39:12.180 --> 39:16.116
* The sky is

39:16.150 --> 39:19.119
* Tumbling from

39:19.150 --> 39:22.813
* Your eyes

39:22.860 --> 39:26.421
*So

39:26.460 --> 39:28.621
* So blind

39:28.660 --> 39:31.629
* A chase to end

39:31.670 --> 39:36.664
* All time

39:36.700 --> 39:41.433
* Seasons call and fall

39:41.480 --> 39:43.778
* From grace

39:43.810 --> 39:46.506
* A human

39:46.550 --> 39:50.145
* Fool

39:50.180 --> 39:55.789
* Anatomical

39:55.820 --> 39:59.688
* Metaphysical

40:02.860 --> 40:05.693
- It really does look black
in the moonlight.

40:05.730 --> 40:09.439
***

40:16.110 --> 40:18.874
(heavy breathing)

40:18.910 --> 40:20.844
- See.

40:22.850 --> 40:25.785
This is all I ever wanted
for you, Will.

40:29.790 --> 40:32.554
For both of us.

40:41.070 --> 40:43.231
(laughing softly)
- It's beautiful.

40:43.270 --> 40:47.502
(heavy breathing)

40:49.840 --> 40:53.606
- * All the time

40:53.650 --> 40:56.619
* A blood red

40:56.650 --> 40:59.687
* Setting sun

41:04.560 --> 41:07.222
* Rushing through

41:07.260 --> 41:10.798
* My veins

41:10.830 --> 41:13.697
* Burning up

41:13.730 --> 41:16.836
* My skin

41:16.870 --> 41:20.636
* I will survive

41:20.670 --> 41:24.037
* Live and thrive

41:24.080 --> 41:26.048
* Win this

41:26.080 --> 41:30.039
* Deadly game

41:30.080 --> 41:34.039

41:43.560 --> 41:47.223

41:50.300 --> 41:53.098
