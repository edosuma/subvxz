WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:05.306
- Tonight, for the first time,
a team challenge

00:05.339 --> 00:06.574
as four Mastersmiths compete

00:06.607 --> 00:08.809
alongside their apprentices.

00:08.842 --> 00:12.046
The heat is on, and
each duo must work together...

00:12.080 --> 00:13.647
- Bam!
We got this.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.416
- Or run the risk of
getting burned.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.584
- Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

00:16.617 --> 00:18.519
- With $10,000 on the line,

00:18.552 --> 00:21.822
which team has what it takes
to be declared

00:21.855 --> 00:25.426
the first-ever "Forged in Fire"
master and apprentice champions?

00:25.459 --> 00:26.694
*

00:26.727 --> 00:29.663
[rock music]

00:29.697 --> 00:30.631
*

00:32.666 --> 00:34.802
*

00:34.835 --> 00:37.138
- I'm Jesse Rhodes.
I'm 34 years old.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.806
I'm the Mastersmith here.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.275
- I'm Zack Lewis;
I like to think of myself

00:41.309 --> 00:43.444
as a "Zack" of all trades,
master of none,

00:43.477 --> 00:45.479
because I just so happen to be
the apprentice around here.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.482
- Zack's definitely got what I'm
looking for, for an apprentice,

00:48.516 --> 00:50.818
because he puts up with me
getting pissed off at him

00:50.851 --> 00:53.654
when he doesn't understand
what I'm trying to say.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.356
- My name is Robert Timberlake.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.126
I taught blacksmithing
for 13 years.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.693
- My name is Wesley Alberson.

00:59.727 --> 01:03.197
I've been working
with Robert for three years.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.233
Sometimes, I feel like
I need to get yelled at.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.535
Like when I'm about
to blow up something.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.636
- I'll see what I can
do about that.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.471
- Okay. All right.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.640
- My name is
Frank Allen Wren II,

01:12.673 --> 01:15.409
but everybody in the world
knows me as "Waldryck."

01:15.443 --> 01:17.711
I'm a master armorer,
and this is my apprentice.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.813
- My name is Nehemiah Russo.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.583
In the Forge, my job is to keep
him happy and keep him busy.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.619
- Nehemiah is a professional,
live-in apprentice.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.521
I mean, he's like a damn cat.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.323
You feed him, and then
he just--he won't go away.

01:29.357 --> 01:33.294
- My name is Joseph Szilaski.
I am from Hungary.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.695
- My name is John Lewis.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.597
The thing I'm
most nervous about,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.566
entering this competition,
is disappointing Joe.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.635
- Nobody's perfect.
I almost perfect.

01:41.669 --> 01:45.639
I thought I was making a mistake
one time, and I was wrong.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.176
So that's the reason
I'm almost perfect.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.710
*

01:49.743 --> 01:51.879
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.314
I'm sure you can tell
it's a little bit

01:53.347 --> 01:55.283
more crowded in here than usual.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.517
That's because the eight of you

01:56.550 --> 01:57.718
are being given the opportunity

01:57.751 --> 01:59.487
to compete for our very first

01:59.520 --> 02:02.690
"Forged in Fire"
master and apprentice title.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.592
Ultimately,
the judges are the ones

02:04.625 --> 02:05.726
who decide
which of you will leave

02:05.759 --> 02:08.496
with $10,000 and the title.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.464
So what do you say
we meet them r now?

02:10.498 --> 02:13.534
ABS Mastersmith
J. Neilson.

02:13.567 --> 02:17.171
Historic weapons recreation
specialist, David Baker.

02:17.205 --> 02:20.708
Kali martial artist
Doug Marcaida.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.676
This challenge
is all about teamwork,

02:22.710 --> 02:24.278
but each master and apprentice

02:24.312 --> 02:25.779
will have to pull
their own weight

02:25.813 --> 02:27.948
in order to advance
in this competition.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.684
I'll let you know exactly
how that will work in a minute.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.821
But first, on the anvils
in front of you is a cloth.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.223
Go ahead and lift that up.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.958
[dramatic music]

02:37.991 --> 02:39.760
On your anvils are

02:39.793 --> 02:44.265
two 3-foot long sections
of 1084 bar stock steel,

02:44.298 --> 02:47.735
that you will use
to forge a cleaver.

02:47.768 --> 02:51.672
However, here's the twist,
or, rather, the roll.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.474
Today, you will have to do

02:53.507 --> 02:55.643
a jelly roll technique
to create a billet,

02:55.676 --> 02:57.845
from which you will
forge your cleavers.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.715
- Great.
A jelly roll billet.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.252
Time for a new
learning experience.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.853
- Keep in mind,
in the second round

03:05.886 --> 03:07.688
you will be putting handles
on your blades

03:07.721 --> 03:09.690
to turn them into
fully-functional weapons

03:09.723 --> 03:11.992
that will be tested
for strength and durability

03:12.025 --> 03:13.927
in a coconut chop

03:13.961 --> 03:16.864
and a water bottle
guillotine slice.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.967
You will have 3 1/2 hours
in which to forge your cleavers.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.372
However, you will rotate
every 30 minutes.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.839
When one is working,

03:25.873 --> 03:27.608
the other one
may not touch the steel,

03:27.641 --> 03:30.010
but you can communicate
with each other.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.280
You have 10 minutes
to work on your design,

03:32.313 --> 03:34.548
during which you can
work together.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.317
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.686
Your 10-minute design window
starts now.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.289
[rock music]

03:41.322 --> 03:42.756
A cleaver is for what?

03:42.790 --> 03:44.425
- For chopping through
meat, bone,

03:44.458 --> 03:45.993
separating parts of an animal

03:46.026 --> 03:48.596
so you can cut them down
with finer blades later.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.364
- We figure the other smiths,
they're probably gonna

03:50.398 --> 03:52.566
make more of
the classical style of cleaver.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.368
We're not going to do
a standard design.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.570
We don't want
a clean kitchen cleaver.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.339
We want something that's
a little different.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.708
[both laugh]

04:00.741 --> 04:03.311
- For our design, I'm just
going to try and keep it simple.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.913
We want to go with, like,
a classic butcher meat cleaver.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.681
- I think the
most challenging part

04:07.715 --> 04:09.483
is going to be
pulling me off the iron,

04:09.517 --> 04:12.486
because I don't have control
over his thoughts.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.422
*

04:14.455 --> 04:17.057
- I'm designing
traditional cleaver,

04:17.090 --> 04:19.793
with a slight
curving to the blade.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.862
I think working with a student,

04:21.895 --> 04:24.465
that's probably
the biggest challenge,

04:24.498 --> 04:28.736
because I want him to learn,
and that can take lot of time.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.339
*

04:31.372 --> 04:34.408
- We're going to make
a simple cleaver.

04:34.442 --> 04:37.645
- I really like Robert's
attitude towards bladesmithing.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.414
He teaches you the way
that he does things,

04:40.448 --> 04:43.317
but he allows you
to do anything that you want.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.386
- Just don't injure yourself.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.321
- Your 10-minute
design window is closed.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.357
Your 3 1/2 hour forge time,

04:49.390 --> 04:50.891
masters first,

04:50.924 --> 04:52.960
starts now.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.962
[energetic rock music]

04:54.995 --> 04:56.730
- Why a jelly roll style?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.799
I know you wouldn't know
what to do with it.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.801
You would eat it.
I would look at it.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.003
[laughter]

05:03.036 --> 05:05.373
- The reason is
we're giving these smiths

05:05.406 --> 05:08.008
long, thin bars of steel
to make a thick, wide blade.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.612
So they need to roll it up and
forge weld it to make that mass.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.381
- This is what I like to see.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.082
Joe, first thing he does,
cleans his material.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.617
- Yep.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.786
- My plan is
make two jelly roll,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.555
and stack them up
and forge weld them.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.091
And that's a slow process.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.094
- Joe is really going slow,
but those are very tight.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.029
- That's what you want to do.

05:29.062 --> 05:32.366
- The time factor for me
is not that important

05:32.400 --> 05:35.436
and the student to learn
the proper technique.

05:35.469 --> 05:39.573
You take it out before the fire,
you're screwed.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.742
If they don't learn
the proper technique,

05:41.775 --> 05:44.878
sooner or later it's going to
bite you in the [bleep].

05:44.912 --> 05:46.814
No shortcuts.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.849
*

05:48.882 --> 05:50.818
- I got those two pieces
of material joined,

05:50.851 --> 05:53.921
because a meat cleaver
is a thick piece of metal.

05:53.954 --> 05:58.125
And I've got a lot of work to do
with not enough time.

05:58.158 --> 06:01.061
- Honestly, the thicker it is,
the harder it is to jelly roll.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.431
- I've got a lot of gaps
between the outsides.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.666
- Jesse, not very tight.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.702
I can see in between all of the
individual layers and swirls.

06:08.736 --> 06:12.440
- It's not quite a jelly roll.
Looks more like a cinnamon roll.

06:12.473 --> 06:16.176
- It is definitely not
a comfortable place to be.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.678
I'm [bleep] kittens.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.047
- Three. Two. One. Switch!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.415
- Go for it!

06:21.449 --> 06:22.816
- I've been working with

06:22.850 --> 06:24.552
Master Waldryck here
quite a while.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.887
And in the shop,
I know he goes kind of mad.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.824
- Remember your training,
and you will come back alive!

06:30.858 --> 06:32.760
- He's not quite
in his right mind.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.828
- Damn it, Nehemiah!

06:34.862 --> 06:36.063
Use the flat of the hammer,
not the round part.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.031
You're putting dimples in it.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.768
- Yeah, well I'm trying to
put more surface area on there.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.136
- Aren't you done yet?

06:43.170 --> 06:46.006
- That guy can give
headache to the aspirin.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.042
- There you go!
Draw that fire!

06:49.076 --> 06:50.778
*

06:50.811 --> 06:52.680
- I'm looking
over here at Robert,

06:52.713 --> 06:54.648
and it looks like
he has set up Wes

06:54.682 --> 06:56.584
with a good start here.

06:56.617 --> 07:00.020
- Jelly roll billets are
a much different monster.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.990
That's getting a little bit
too spaced apart.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.226
I try to emulate,
the best I can,

07:06.259 --> 07:08.161
what Robert's already done.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.830
Nope.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.632
But, because of
the time constraint,

07:11.665 --> 07:13.634
I feel a bit frantic.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.469
Oh.
That's not fun.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.970
- Go ahead and finish that heat.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.772
Finish the heat.
- All right, all right.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.841
It feels like the progress
is really slow,

07:20.874 --> 07:22.876
which is making me
really concerned.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.679
To be honest I don't think
we're going to make it, but...

07:25.713 --> 07:27.481
- Hey...
- All right.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.849
- None of them
negative ways, man.

07:28.882 --> 07:29.850
- Yeah.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.118
*

07:31.151 --> 07:33.621
- Coming out.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.523
So I play this game with Joe,
back in our forge and here,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.057
where it's
monkey see, monkey do.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.826
*

07:38.859 --> 07:40.227
- Good.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.496
- Of course, I'm the monkey.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.231
I got into bladesmithing because

07:44.264 --> 07:45.833
I've always been
interested in Japanese knives.

07:45.866 --> 07:46.967
And a lightbulb
went off in my head.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.836
And I'm like,

07:48.869 --> 07:50.037
"Instead of collecting,
I'm gonna make them."

07:50.070 --> 07:52.139
- Make it tight.
- Tight up.

07:52.172 --> 07:56.610
Time's an issue, but I'm also
looking at the other smiths.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.980
And the jelly rolls that they
have look really loose to me.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.715
- Doing good.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.818
- Three. Two. One.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.720
Switch!

08:06.754 --> 08:08.956
You have 2 1/2 hours remaining.

08:08.989 --> 08:09.990
Let's keep it moving.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.625
- See, he's moving.

08:11.659 --> 08:12.960
- Yeah, there you go!
- [laughs]

08:12.993 --> 08:15.262
- There you go, yeah.
- [laughs]

08:15.295 --> 08:17.264
*

08:17.297 --> 08:19.166
- [bleep]

08:19.199 --> 08:24.872
We have lost the advantage
of having a tight roll,

08:24.905 --> 08:27.575
and this can come back
to bite you later on.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.077
And it shows up as
a blister between the layers.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.249
- It looks like Robert
is really taking the time

08:36.283 --> 08:38.752
to make sure
that those seams are closed.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.154
But if the master
is constantly correcting

08:41.188 --> 08:42.990
the apprentice's mistakes,

08:43.023 --> 08:44.558
then there's no moving forward.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.826
*

08:45.859 --> 08:48.729
Three. Two. One.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.963
Switch!

08:49.997 --> 08:51.799
- Bam!
We got this.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.801
Jesse is really encouraging
in this challenge.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.769
It's good to have
somebody in your corner,

08:55.803 --> 08:57.605
because you definitely have
the pressure on out there.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.973
- Doing good, Zack.
I'm happy.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.575
I haven't yelled at you once.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.342
- I know.
Hell, that's impressive.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.578
- Doing good!

09:04.612 --> 09:07.080
- Honestly, I think Zack's
closed up some of those gaps

09:07.114 --> 09:09.683
that Jesse put in
doing the initial roll.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.985
- Zack's looking really good.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.887
- [Bleep].
Go giving me compliments...

09:13.921 --> 09:15.022
- Steel on the floor!

09:15.055 --> 09:18.025
- Three. Two. One.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.960
Switch!

09:19.993 --> 09:21.829
- Welding!

09:21.862 --> 09:24.197
I am doing well at this point.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.699
And I decide I am going to try

09:25.733 --> 09:27.300
start squishing it
a little bit.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.203
*

09:30.237 --> 09:32.072
[bleep]

09:32.105 --> 09:34.241
- I think Frank just
undid all of the work

09:34.274 --> 09:35.909
that they did
over the last half hour.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.044
- Yeah.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.780
- Son of a [bleep].

09:39.813 --> 09:42.382
Everything on that
jelly roll is getting loose.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.384
I screwed up, Nehemiah.
Sorry.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.352
- And then time changes.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.654
- Time changes.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.155
- Time.
- Switch!

09:48.188 --> 09:49.289
- You can come point.
You can come point.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.958
- You have 60 minutes remaining!

09:50.991 --> 09:52.325
- Remove this here.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.293
I gotta roll this
all the way around.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.328
Get rid of that.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.330
- I'm afraid, at this point,
that Frank and Nehemiah might be

09:57.364 --> 09:59.733
so far behind that
there's no catching up.

09:59.767 --> 10:00.634
- I don't know.
They might not.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.235
*

10:02.269 --> 10:04.071
- I am nervous right now.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.673
[groans]

10:05.706 --> 10:08.041
My skill sets are
not high enough.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.810
I'm not sure we're
gonna get it done.

10:09.843 --> 10:14.782
*

10:14.815 --> 10:16.316
- I gotta take
a couple steps back,

10:16.349 --> 10:18.652
because my skill sets
are not high enough.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.789
- And that's when
we start cutting.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.858
Whoo!
Yeah!

10:24.892 --> 10:29.096
Nehemiah's going to cut it
and leaf it open,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.098
and then get that roll tight.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.399
- Look what
Nehemiah's done, man.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.834
Look at this guy.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.736
- There you go, there you go.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.871
- Once I open that thing up,
now I'm trying to

10:37.905 --> 10:40.007
tap that thing back down
and chase those wrinkles.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.009
- Good, good, good, good, good.
Very good.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.712
- Nehemiah has just turned
this competition around.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.246
That miracle you're asking for?

10:46.279 --> 10:48.982
Shazam.
I think that just happened.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.151
- Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
Do it, Nehemiah, do it!

10:51.184 --> 10:54.387
- Three. Two. One.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.422
Switch!

10:55.455 --> 10:57.257
*

10:57.290 --> 10:59.192
- I'm not
a nervous type of a guy.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.794
The only time I get nervous

11:00.828 --> 11:02.796
is if somebody's
shooting at me, probably.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.132
But I know that we're not
going to have time

11:05.165 --> 11:08.168
to forge our four billet.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.704
- Now, Joe is going
for just one billet.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.005
I mean, is that enough steel?

11:12.039 --> 11:14.007
- It's looking really thin.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.844
- I hope that I can
draw out my jelly roll

11:16.877 --> 11:18.178
to make a cleaver.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.849
*

11:21.882 --> 11:23.083
- Yeah!

11:23.116 --> 11:24.852
Get it, J.R.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.486
Now, that's a cleaver.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.790
- Zack and Jesse, they
seem to be farther out ahead.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.424
- We're having a good time
doing what we love.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.226
- Whoo-whoo!
- Whoo!

11:33.260 --> 11:35.195
Whoo!
- Yee-haw!

11:35.228 --> 11:36.764
And throw out a "yee-haw"
here and there.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.331
You gotta have fun with it.
Yow!

11:38.365 --> 11:40.100
- And they're still
goofing around and joking

11:40.133 --> 11:41.501
with each other; they're
still having a good time.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.136
- They're having fun.
- That's great.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.938
- [bleep] yeah.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.440
- Just draw me out four inches
and chop it off.

11:47.474 --> 11:53.080
- In the heat of battle,
you need someone to control you.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.749
- Perfect! Now draw me out
four inches of that thing.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.450
So it's my job to shove
the numbers in his face

11:57.484 --> 11:59.452
and keep him on track.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.889
So the blade starts there
and I need it to end there.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.758
- Look at those two.
Who's teaching who?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.459
- All I gotta do
is try and steer

12:06.493 --> 12:08.161
this mad, crazy, little dwarf.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.063
- [laughs]
- Oh.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.364
*

12:11.398 --> 12:13.867
- So all of those dark spots

12:13.901 --> 12:17.470
on Robert's blade,
those are all voids.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.473
- They're all delaminations
or cold shunts.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.175
Flux jammed in there.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.210
- Can't do a whole lot
about them now.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.278
- Yeah.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.446
- At this point, Robert
needs to get on the grinder

12:26.479 --> 12:28.248
and start
getting out these delams

12:28.281 --> 12:29.549
rather than continuing to
draw out his blade.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.851
[dramatic music]

12:30.884 --> 12:32.385
- Close enough for me.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.921
*

12:33.954 --> 12:37.190
- Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.259
Six. Five.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.829
Four. Three.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.831
Two. One.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.298
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.168
Drop your tools.
This round is over!

12:48.201 --> 12:51.038
[heavy rock music]

12:51.071 --> 12:54.507
- It's done.
I am so happy.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.910
We've got something that I know,
once we put an edge on it,

12:56.944 --> 12:59.346
this going to chop
through anything.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.014
Or it's going to break.
One of the two.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.482
[suspenseful music]

13:02.515 --> 13:04.451
- Welcome back, bladesmiths.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.887
You may have noticed
that we are one master short.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.256
That's because
Jesse had a personal matter

13:09.289 --> 13:11.324
that he felt needed
his immediate attention

13:11.358 --> 13:14.561
and has removed himself
from this competition.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.097
Zack, I have conferred
with the judges,

13:17.130 --> 13:18.932
and they have decided that

13:18.966 --> 13:21.468
if your work moves forward
in this competition,

13:21.501 --> 13:25.038
they would be willing
to let you compete by yourself,

13:25.072 --> 13:27.074
without Jesse.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.109
But understand,
if you choose to continue,

13:29.142 --> 13:31.578
you will be at a disadvantage.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.414
- I'll have to be the master
and the apprentice here.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.616
And though I am
more primitive than Jesse

13:36.649 --> 13:39.152
and have less tools,

13:39.186 --> 13:40.553
I accept your terms.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.955
- All right. Good job.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.023
- Outstanding.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.325
Huzzah.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.928
- All right.
Zack, you're up first.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.497
[tense music]

13:50.530 --> 13:52.632
- Well, Zack, when you guys
were doing that jelly roll,

13:52.665 --> 13:54.201
there was a lot
of gaps in there.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.535
I was really wondering
if you guys

13:55.568 --> 13:57.104
would be able
to close that up.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.638
There's a couple
of little spots,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.273
but nothing that
can't be worked around.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.142
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.311
- Frank, Nehemiah,
you're up next.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.179
*

14:06.213 --> 14:09.049
- First of all,
a master and apprentice--

14:09.082 --> 14:10.650
there's a lot of coaching.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.886
And there was a lot
of screaming from your area.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.188
We were watching you,
and your coil started to uncurl.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.991
But you guys stayed together.
You stayed in the game.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.428
And you've presented us
with a cleaver.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.196
- Joe and John, you may please

14:23.230 --> 14:25.065
present your weapon
to the judges.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.167
*

14:27.200 --> 14:29.502
- Beautiful steel.
Nicely done.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.604
But I'm not sure
if I'm seeing a cleaver.

14:31.638 --> 14:36.409
Cleavers usually have at least
one slightly curved or flat edge

14:36.443 --> 14:39.679
so you can actually
hit a flat section completely.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.115
And that's kind of
lacking in this.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.084
- Robert, Wes, you're up next.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.386
*

14:46.419 --> 14:48.055
- You guys rolled up the steel

14:48.088 --> 14:49.389
nice and tight
in the start.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.490
It just kind of
got away from you

14:50.523 --> 14:52.292
at the end there, it looks like.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.161
But this is like cooked bacon.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.596
There's a lot of
blisters and voids.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.698
Usually I get concerned
when I can

14:58.731 --> 15:00.433
catch the tip of
my fingernail in it.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.435
My entire fingernail
can fit in here.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.438
So that concerns me a lot.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.240
- All right, bladesmiths.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.976
I'm going to have you leave
your blades here

15:09.009 --> 15:12.045
while the judges
go into deliberation.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.714
[soft dramatic music]

15:14.747 --> 15:16.516
- This is it, guys.
Final judgment.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.218
- Good luck for all you guys.
- Yeah.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.053
- Yeah, all you guys.
- You too, man.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.356
- All right, gentlemen,
I see two blades with good steel

15:23.390 --> 15:25.058
that is absolutely
moving forward.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.293
Would you guys agree?

15:26.326 --> 15:28.128
- Yes.
- Yeah.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.163
- Okay.
- Frank and Nehemiah and Zack.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.664
Zack's going to be at a
big disadvantage going forward,

15:31.698 --> 15:33.666
but his blade's beautiful.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.237
- Okay. Let's move on
to Wes and Robert's cleaver.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.406
[dramatic music]

15:39.439 --> 15:41.208
- It looks like
an unholy catastrophe.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.543
There's huge gaps in here.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.545
I mean, I could
fit a dime in there.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.015
- I'm hoping that,
if they do go forward,

15:48.048 --> 15:50.083
that there's enough material

15:50.117 --> 15:51.651
from the center of this blade,
under all these bubbles

15:51.684 --> 15:54.287
so that they can make
a cleaver out of it.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.423
- Let's move on to Joe and John.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.658
*

15:58.691 --> 16:01.294
- They did
the traditional jelly roll,

16:01.328 --> 16:04.631
and they did
a beautiful job on it.

16:04.664 --> 16:08.168
Um, cleaver?
Not what I think of.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.237
- We ask them
to make a particular thing.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.205
This is just round one;
there's a round two,

16:12.239 --> 16:14.407
where you can still continue
to work on your metal.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.276
There's a lot of metal in here.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.745
There's not a lot left in here.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.747
- All right, gentlemen, we
have to make a final decision.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.115
Doug, have you made yours?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.183
- Yes, I have.
- Dave?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.384
- Yeah.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.785
- J.?
- Oh, yeah.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.720
- All right.
Let's go tell our smiths.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.622
Gentlemen,

16:29.656 --> 16:31.558
the judges have made
their final decision.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.227
It's time for one of these teams
to leave the Forge.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.630
*

16:37.664 --> 16:41.034
John and Joe,
your blade did not make the cut.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.771
- Watching you guys make
that jelly roll was great.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.306
But what it came down to
in the end is

16:46.339 --> 16:48.208
we just don't see
a cleaver there.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.177
And I don't see you
being able to fix this.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.112
There's just
not enough material.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.747
For that reason,
we have to send you home.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.351
- John, Joe,
please surrender your work.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.387
- I agree with the decision,

17:00.420 --> 17:04.224
but you can chop onions
and flip burger with it.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.427
But to see
John doing so well--

17:07.460 --> 17:10.530
it was more important
than anything else, you know.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.532
- I am better than I was
when I got here.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.234
*

17:14.267 --> 17:16.203
- Congratulations, bladesmiths.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.637
You've each made it
into the second round

17:17.670 --> 17:20.073
of this competition.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.374
Your blades have been tempered,
and now it's time to turn them

17:21.408 --> 17:22.675
into fully-functional weapons

17:22.709 --> 17:24.577
by attaching handles to them.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.513
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.815
You should use that time
to address flaws and issues

17:28.848 --> 17:30.783
that were identified
in your blades.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.186
When the time runs out,
your weapons will be tested

17:33.220 --> 17:35.622
for strength and durability
in a coconut chop,

17:35.655 --> 17:40.393
for edge retention
in a guillotine bottle slice.

17:40.427 --> 17:43.330
Apprentices, you will start,
followed by the masters.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.365
Zack, you are flying solo.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.866
Good luck, brother.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.636
Your three hours starts now.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.604
[energetic rock music]

17:51.638 --> 17:53.573
- And we're off to the races.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.108
- Wes went for the torch
right away.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.843
What's going on over there?

17:56.876 --> 17:58.778
- We told them that the forges
weren't available

17:58.811 --> 18:01.448
the second round, but
they can use anything else.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.151
So he's trying to get all of
the blisters out of his blade.

18:04.184 --> 18:07.620
- The acetylene torch is the
only heat source that we have.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.157
That's going to take
forever to heat up.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.259
I have to come up
with a different way

18:12.292 --> 18:13.860
to use the torch
in a safe environment

18:13.893 --> 18:15.795
to heat the blade.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.364
- Are they building
their own forge down there?

18:17.397 --> 18:19.466
- Yeah.
- That's great.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.268
- "You won't let me use
those forges? I'll make my own."

18:21.301 --> 18:23.503
- The judges want to give us
a big challenge,

18:23.536 --> 18:26.506
or else they really need
a good laugh.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.609
- Slow and easy, like a cat
eating a brick, Nehemiah.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.311
- Our game plan for round two

18:31.344 --> 18:33.880
is getting that handle on
good and secure.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.215
You like how that looks?

18:35.248 --> 18:37.384
- Well, actually, I do.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.420
- I literally grabbed the two
flashiest pieces I could find.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.322
Clear, shiny.
Grabbing it.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.524
[laughter]

18:44.557 --> 18:46.426
- Switch!

18:46.459 --> 18:48.295
Except for you, Zack.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.464
You're good.
- [laughs]

18:51.498 --> 18:53.333
- My master had to leave
the competition,

18:53.366 --> 18:56.503
so it's me against
master and apprentice now.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.804
I don't know
if I'm ready for it,

18:57.837 --> 18:59.672
but I'm here to win.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.475
And that's what I'm going
to continue to try for.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.577
I just started doing
handles a month ago.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.314
And my biggest concern is

19:07.347 --> 19:09.782
drilling the three holes
that rivet my tang on.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.918
[material squealing]

19:11.951 --> 19:13.453
Gonna definitely be
squealing through those holes.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.322
- That noise is
not a good noise.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.789
- This steel is tough.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.558
It's hard to
go through this [bleep].

19:18.591 --> 19:19.926
Breaking drill bits
left and right.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.661
[bleep].

19:21.694 --> 19:23.430
You know what?
Scrap it.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.698
I'm giving up
on the third hole.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.900
I'm hoping two rivets is going
to hold this handle together.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.636
I'm praying at this rate.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.238
*

19:31.271 --> 19:32.705
- Robert and Wes, I mean,

19:32.739 --> 19:34.707
they've got
a fight on their hands.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.876
Oh, you can the edges
of those delams in the torch.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.379
- Oh, man.
- Those varying colors.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.547
That's from all
the different layers

19:40.580 --> 19:42.482
that aren't welded together.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.384
- There's nothing we can do
about the shape of the edge.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.219
We'll just have to
grind it down to an edge,

19:46.253 --> 19:48.621
even though it will be
kind of spotty.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.423
- I'm going to leave all
the beauty marks on it, okay?

19:50.457 --> 19:51.624
- [laughs]

19:51.658 --> 19:53.726
It's going to be ugly.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.929
- Seriously, it looked like it'd
been beaten with an ugly stick.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.431
- Switch!

19:58.465 --> 19:59.966
*

19:59.999 --> 20:01.601
- What I want to see next is

20:01.634 --> 20:03.703
get them holes in it

20:03.736 --> 20:05.672
so that we can run pins.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.707
Come on Nehemiah.
You ain't going to do any more.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.676
We don't have time. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.311
- I don't think I could handle
having somebody sitting over

20:11.344 --> 20:12.445
my shoulder like that,
screaming at me.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.980
- And then wet.
You got--

20:14.013 --> 20:15.848
- I just wetted it a second ago.
- All right.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.417
- I could probably
handle it for a while,

20:17.450 --> 20:18.385
but not with a weapon
in my hand.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.019
- Yeah.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.954
- I am really frazzled
right now, because I have

20:21.988 --> 20:23.956
never worked under
a time crunch like this before.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.992
- Come back over to this side.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.794
- We wanted to put holes in
before we do the heat treat.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.363
That's the one thing
you're always supposed to do.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.565
The last hole is just
giving me problems, boss.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.733
*

20:33.766 --> 20:35.502
Battle. Battle. Battle.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.537
I'm getting
more and more frazzled.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.705
[groans]

20:38.738 --> 20:41.608
It is just a nightmare.

20:41.641 --> 20:44.511
If I have a crack in this tang,
it's over.

20:44.544 --> 20:48.348
So close!

20:48.381 --> 20:49.616
- Switch!

20:49.649 --> 20:50.483
- Let's see what boss can do.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.452
- [sighs]

20:52.485 --> 20:54.321
Handle work
is not what I enjoy.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.655
It's not my thing.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.056
Nope.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.891
You're in a war.
You're in a battle.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.862
There is a point when
you must learn to sacrifice.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.731
I can't keep working
on the holes

21:04.764 --> 21:05.932
when I have
the other things to work on.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.735
Damn it.
That's it, two pins.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.437
We don't have time
to mess with that [bleep].

21:10.470 --> 21:13.072
- You have just
60 minutes remaining

21:13.105 --> 21:15.408
to finish those cleavers!

21:15.442 --> 21:17.477
- For the handle material,

21:17.510 --> 21:19.879
I'm going to be using
some pretty carbon fiber.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.981
Looks good on a car hood,
so might as well see

21:22.014 --> 21:23.883
how it looks on my cleaver.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.618
This is my first
synthetic-scale handle.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.853
[bleep].

21:26.886 --> 21:28.621
- Zack over there with

21:28.655 --> 21:29.822
the "Oops,
the pin's too big" problem.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.891
- He's flying solo.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.694
- I look at it as an advantage,
to really say, "Okay.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.763
"I was taughwell.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.998
Now I'm going to show
exactly what I'm capable of."

21:39.031 --> 21:40.933
So it's a chance
to really shine.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.336
*

21:43.370 --> 21:45.071
[energetic rock music]

21:45.104 --> 21:47.474
- Wes and I decided to
wrap the handle with Paracord,

21:47.507 --> 21:49.008
because it takes less time.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.511
And we don't have time
to spare on this.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.979
- Cord-wrapped handles
are pretty common.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.781
They can be very comfortable.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.116
But if there's any play
in that cord at all,

21:57.149 --> 21:58.651
it's just going to come loose.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.919

21:59.952 --> 22:01.688
Switch!

22:01.721 --> 22:04.056
Masters, 30 minutes
to finish your work.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.626
- I need to
start sharpening quick.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.861
- Regardless of
how dysfunctional

22:08.895 --> 22:10.630
that cleaver looks,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.732
those guys came to play.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.635
- With one pull, all
the hairs on the top of my arm

22:15.668 --> 22:16.903
just come right off.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.506
Hm.
Well, that's sharp enough.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.975
- Ten. Nine.
Eight. Seven.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.477
Six. Five.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.679
Four. Three.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.515
Two. One.

22:28.548 --> 22:29.982
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.752
Drop your tools.
This round is over.

22:32.785 --> 22:33.886
[upbeat rock music]

22:33.920 --> 22:36.489
- Whoo!
Okay, that was fun.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.691
*

22:38.725 --> 22:41.528
- Honestly, I'm impressed with
what we were able to pull off.

22:41.561 --> 22:45.398
Now it's left to the judges, and
see what they can do with it.

22:45.432 --> 22:48.435
- Smiths, welcome to
the strength test,

22:48.468 --> 22:50.069
our coconut chop.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.671
I'm going to test
the strength and durability

22:51.704 --> 22:53.473
of the edges of your cleavers.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.675
You're going to get
three coconuts per cleaver,

22:55.708 --> 22:57.076
one smack per coconut.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.745
And we're going to see

22:58.778 --> 23:00.513
not what your cleavers do
to these coconuts,

23:00.547 --> 23:02.882
but what the coconuts do
to your cleavers.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.451
Zack, you're up first.
Are you ready?

23:04.484 --> 23:05.618

will hold it together.

That blew through

sitting there anymore.

- Your edge is fine.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.721
There's no deformation.
That's a good job.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.515
The blade felt good in hand.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.717
Your handle's kind of
on the round side,

24:10.750 --> 24:14.186
so when I would hit, it would
move in my hand a little bit.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.624
Just enough to let those pins
dig into my palm nicely.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.192
But aside from that, good job.

The front part?

There's actually flakes

right here.

in that I was expecting

25:02.602 --> 25:05.171
a lot more to come loose.

the sharpness of your blade,

25:07.807 --> 25:09.976
we're going to clamp them
in our guillotine device.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.078
Once released,
that blade will drop down,

Zack, you're up and I've got
your blade already attached.

25:52.685 --> 25:57.256
*

25:59.959 --> 26:02.294
[soft dramatic music]

26:02.328 --> 26:03.696
*

26:03.730 --> 26:04.831
- Well, that was a clean cut.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.900
That just sliced right through.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.269
It cut to--you can see
the waterline right there?

26:10.302 --> 26:12.905
And the reason
it couldn't go past that

26:12.939 --> 26:15.608
is because having that
bent handle,

26:15.642 --> 26:17.109
I would not be able to chop

26:17.143 --> 26:20.179
how I want to chop
with a cleaver.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.047
But it will definitely cut.
Did a great job.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.751
- Thank you.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.218
- Robert, Wes, it's your turn.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.687
You ready?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.789
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.825
- I think the other two teams
are ahead right now,

26:32.859 --> 26:37.329
so our blade really needs
to perform perfectly.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.632
- The bottom line is
the proof is in the pudding.

26:39.666 --> 26:47.239
[dramatic music]

26:47.273 --> 26:48.374
[soft dramatic music]

26:48.407 --> 26:51.043
[snickers]

26:51.077 --> 26:52.945
- All right, so, Robert, Wes,

26:52.979 --> 26:54.413
you can see
by the bottle here that

26:54.446 --> 26:56.248
when the blade came down,

26:56.282 --> 26:59.719
it actually crushed the bottle
and popped the side.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.088
I have a feeling that,
with those sections

27:02.121 --> 27:04.356
that are missing
on the edge of that blade,

27:04.390 --> 27:07.827
it just wasn't able
to cut through.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.297
- Masters and apprentices,

27:11.330 --> 27:13.733
the judges have made
their final decision.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.035
It's time for one of these teams
to leave the Forge.

27:16.068 --> 27:19.005
[dramatic music]

27:19.038 --> 27:20.439
*

27:20.472 --> 27:22.108
Wes, Robert,

27:22.141 --> 27:25.111
your cleaver
did not make the cut.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.445
- You know, guys,
you walked into the second round

27:26.478 --> 27:28.414
with some issues
with that blade.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.682
And you came up with
some great, creative ways

27:29.716 --> 27:31.718
to work around those.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.153
But unfortunately, your blade
is critically damaged.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.756
So that's why we have
to send you home.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.458
- Wes, Robert,
please surrender your cleaver.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.460
*

27:41.493 --> 27:44.263
- My experience being here
with Wes was quite delightful.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.265
I enjoy working with him,

27:46.298 --> 27:48.868
and I hope we continue
to improve our skills together.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.771
- He lets me do my own thing.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.372
- I don't let him.
I encourage him.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.807
- Oh--yeah.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.944
*

27:57.977 --> 28:01.013
- Zack, Frank, Nehemiah,
congratulations.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.716
You've made it into the
final round of competition.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.451
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

28:05.484 --> 28:07.286
for five days

28:07.319 --> 28:09.455
to recreate
an iconic weapon from history.

28:09.488 --> 28:12.892
[dramatic music]

28:12.925 --> 28:14.160
The Nzappa zap.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.162
- Yes.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.030
- The Nzappa zap originated

28:18.064 --> 28:19.932
in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo

28:19.966 --> 28:22.168
as a weapon of war and power.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.403
During close-quarter combat,
it was a powerful chopper,

28:24.436 --> 28:26.472
slicing through
opponents with ease.

28:26.505 --> 28:27.940
While from a distance,
the Nzappa zap

28:27.974 --> 28:29.508
was just as dangerous

28:29.541 --> 28:30.910
and could be hurled
at the enemy,

28:30.943 --> 28:32.411
causing its sharpened blade

28:32.444 --> 28:34.747
to penetrate
through flesh and bone.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.482
Although deadly,
the weapon was also regarded

28:36.515 --> 28:38.384
as a symbol of prestige,

28:38.417 --> 28:40.887
carried by chiefs
in ceremonial displays.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.922
The crescent-shaped blade
is often ornate,

28:42.955 --> 28:45.758
with twisted bars
and etchings of human faces

28:45.792 --> 28:49.195
that were symbolic
of the chief's tribesmen.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.030
You will have five days
at your home forge

28:51.063 --> 28:52.832
to complete this challenge.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.500
Nehemiah and Frank,
you will not be able to

28:54.533 --> 28:56.869
work on your weapon
at the same time.

28:56.903 --> 29:00.306
Nehemiah will start on day one,
and you will rotate each day.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.909
Zack, you're running solo.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.443
- Yeah, I got my work
cut out for me.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.779
I am just
the lowly apprentice,

29:06.813 --> 29:09.982
so I'm feeling like the underdog
going out of here.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.284
- After five days, you will
return to present your weapons

29:12.318 --> 29:14.353
to our panel of expert judges.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.788
Only after they've
submitted them

29:15.822 --> 29:17.456
to a series of brutal tests

29:17.489 --> 29:19.258
will they declare one team,

29:19.291 --> 29:21.260
or individual,

29:21.293 --> 29:24.196
the "Forged in Fire"
master and apprentice champion

29:24.230 --> 29:26.232
and hand you that check
for ten grand.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.934
All right, bladesmiths.
Good luck.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.335
We'll see you in five days.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.237
- Let's do this.
- All right.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.073
[heavy rock music]

29:34.106 --> 29:35.107
- Let's get this thing going.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.143
- You're not done yet?

29:37.176 --> 29:39.545
I've got to make this thing
called a za--za--za--

29:39.578 --> 29:41.413
zappa--dap, uh...

29:41.447 --> 29:43.816
- An Nzappa zap!

29:43.850 --> 29:46.418
- How I decided to attack
this is really simple.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.388
Nehemiah is an
extremely good woodworker.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.323
- I'm going to focus a lot
on the handle today.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.492
We're making this weapon
both historically accurate

29:53.525 --> 29:55.461
and as robust as possible.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.329
- All right, let me know
if you need anything.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.432
Sitting here,
watching and not helping,

30:00.466 --> 30:01.968
is killing me!

30:02.001 --> 30:03.502
"You're doing well, Nehemiah.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.037
That is very good, Nehemiah."

30:05.071 --> 30:06.906
[groans]

30:06.939 --> 30:09.575
- All right, I'm liking
this rough shape so far.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.477
[dramatic music]

30:11.510 --> 30:13.279
- Today we're here
in Sonora, California,

30:13.312 --> 30:15.181
here to make an Nzappa zap.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.216
Let's see how it goes.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.051
I can't fit it in here,

30:19.085 --> 30:20.920
so I might have to do
this thing old-fashioned.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.890
To be truthfully honest,
I'm scared [bleep]less.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.025
My master had
a personal emergency.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.860
He had to leave the competition,

30:27.894 --> 30:30.296
and now I'm stranded here
doing this on my own.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.331
Just got to keep it together.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.867
It's amazing I've made it
this far by myself,

30:34.901 --> 30:36.002
but I'm going to give it my all,

30:36.035 --> 30:37.937
give 110% and see what I can do.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.071
[churning]

30:39.105 --> 30:41.073
There we go!

30:41.107 --> 30:42.875
The most important thing
is getting this blade shape.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.878
*

30:45.912 --> 30:48.981
I think we might be able to fit
it in that propane forge now.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.217
I'm trying to stay on
a "glass half full" with this.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.219
I'm up against two guys
who are armorers.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.054
[bleep]

30:55.087 --> 30:57.223
I'm construction.
I don't do this every day.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.458
So I'm really hoping
that my artistic eye

30:59.491 --> 31:01.928
is going to be
what sets me ahead in this game.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.330
[heavy rock music]

31:04.363 --> 31:05.331
[soft dramatic music]

31:05.364 --> 31:07.466
- Today, it's my turn.

31:07.499 --> 31:10.536
I gotta turn this square piece
of hot metal into a blade.

31:10.569 --> 31:13.305
Nehemiah split it down
the middle the night before,

31:13.339 --> 31:15.541
so that I could pull that apart,
and there's my blade.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.277
Zack better
be bringing his game!

31:18.310 --> 31:20.012
*

31:20.046 --> 31:21.513
A charcoal forge
is one of the most

31:21.547 --> 31:23.482
interesting ways to heat treat.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.617
And what I'm looking for is
an even red color,

31:25.651 --> 31:27.253
all the way across.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.921
That's our color, Nehemiah.
- Yep.

31:28.955 --> 31:32.591
*

31:32.624 --> 31:34.193
[rock music]

31:34.226 --> 31:35.561
- Let's hear how
this thing sounds.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.264
[scraping]

31:38.297 --> 31:39.698
- Awesome.
- [whistles]

31:39.731 --> 31:41.333
It's hard.

31:41.367 --> 31:42.268
Incredible.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.635
*

31:43.669 --> 31:45.204
- Day three.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.939
And I'd like to be

31:46.973 --> 31:49.041
a little further than I am.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.177
I want this thing
to be perfect before I quench.

31:51.210 --> 31:54.046
[lively suspense music]

31:54.080 --> 31:56.315
I'm going to heat up
my oil a little bit here.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.217
If I want to be
a "Forged in Fire" champion,

31:58.250 --> 32:00.152
I've got to pull out
all the tricks.

32:00.186 --> 32:02.054
I figure I've got
to preheat this stuff.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.690
You want to have it
around 200 degrees.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.225
Never had that going on.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.294
*

32:08.327 --> 32:10.496
It's really getting
a little bit out of hand.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.332
Kind of getting to
an uncontrollable fire.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.367
I'm a little nervous.

32:15.401 --> 32:18.504
I have never felt anxiety
like this before.

32:22.074 --> 32:25.511
- Um, star to think...

32:25.544 --> 32:27.346
It's really getting
a little bit out of hand.

32:27.379 --> 32:30.216
I need that
[bleep] stop sign.

32:30.249 --> 32:31.683
Kind of getting to
an uncontrollable fire.

32:31.717 --> 32:34.120
*

32:34.153 --> 32:36.155
Luckily, that worked.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.656
I didn't want to have
the fire department out here.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.091
[heavy rock music]

32:39.125 --> 32:40.192
Now I can quench my blade.

32:40.226 --> 32:41.327
[exhales]

32:41.360 --> 32:43.495
*

32:43.529 --> 32:46.498
- Today's my last day.
I'm working this copper cap.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.068
I've got to get this on here
for part of the decoration.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.369
*

32:50.402 --> 32:52.538
All right.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.040
Aw, [bleep] damn it.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.541
Crack.

32:55.574 --> 32:59.278
Son of a [bleep].
Nehemiah!

32:59.311 --> 33:01.113
Nehemiah did the handle.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.314
Now I got to fix it.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.715
Oh my.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.417
That couldn't be any worse.

33:05.451 --> 33:06.585
I think I'm going to
just go right to

33:06.618 --> 33:08.120
the grinder and grind it now.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.389
- Yeah?
- [bleep].

33:10.422 --> 33:12.291
The breaking of the handle

33:12.324 --> 33:14.193
is a little bit of
a blessing in disguise.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.462
Now I can hang onto it,
right up to the butt.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.130
The handle was way too thick.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.631
*

33:19.665 --> 33:21.067
Yay!

33:21.100 --> 33:22.501
I'm glad to be done.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.203
Nehemiah will have it tomorrow.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.372
He will be sharpening the blade

33:26.405 --> 33:28.374
and getting it
completely finished.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.043
Mr. DeVille,
I'm ready for my close-up.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.578
[rock music]

33:32.611 --> 33:34.280
- My quench came out great.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.781
*

33:35.814 --> 33:37.183
[bleep].

33:37.216 --> 33:38.784
But the clock's crunching.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.587
I want to make use
of every minute I got.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.322
This would be where--
where it'd be nice to

33:43.355 --> 33:45.257
have a partner
to hand this to, instead of

33:45.291 --> 33:47.793
worrying about turning
your torch off and everything.

33:47.826 --> 33:50.462
I'm the only guy
out here on my team.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.132
It's a lot of pressure.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.466
I don't want
to be cocky or anything,

33:54.500 --> 33:56.302
but the blade's looking awesome.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.105
It's got all the
intricate artwork on the steel.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.273
I really did
a weird hammer pattern, so

34:01.307 --> 34:03.342
it looks like it was made
with just rocks in the Congo.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.278
I'm hoping to put this
Nzappa zap on the mappa map!

34:06.312 --> 34:08.180
[sighs]
First time using it.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.715
*

34:09.748 --> 34:11.250
[music pounds]

34:11.283 --> 34:13.519
Think it'll cut?

34:13.552 --> 34:16.088
Probably will kill.

34:16.122 --> 34:17.856
[suspenseful music]

34:17.889 --> 34:19.191
*

34:19.225 --> 34:21.160
- Zack, Frank, and Nehemiah,

34:21.193 --> 34:22.728
welcome back to the Forge.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.330
You've had five days
at your home forge

34:24.363 --> 34:26.198
to work on your Nzappa zaps.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.666
Zack, you were working solo.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.435
How did it go for you?

34:29.468 --> 34:31.437
- It worked out better
than I thought it would.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.373
I really wanted to keep
an African Congo look to it,

34:34.406 --> 34:36.608
but I wanted it to have
a lot of artistic flair.

34:36.642 --> 34:39.111
Those guys in the Congo,
they are tough, so,

34:39.145 --> 34:40.712
hopefully, this is
just what they would want.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.847
- All right.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.549
Frank, Nehemiah,

34:43.582 --> 34:45.551
how did it go for you
at your home forge?

34:45.584 --> 34:48.520
- Well, in a way, y'all have
invented blacksmith Hell.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.390
It was very challenging
to make the balance.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.325
I'd handle certain parts.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.261
Nehemiah, he would
handle certain parts.

34:55.294 --> 34:56.795
That was, I think,
the hardest part about it.

34:56.828 --> 34:59.498
But we tried to put ourselves
into the blade.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.633
- All right. Let's see
how your blades hold up.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.535
Up first is the kill test.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.537
Doug?

35:05.571 --> 35:07.473
- Bladesmiths, a Nzappa zap

35:07.506 --> 35:08.607
was a brutal weapon

35:08.640 --> 35:10.376
used in close quarter.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.344
We'll see how lethal
your weapon is

35:12.378 --> 35:15.414
when I deliver multiple strikes
on this pig carcass.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.615
Zack, you're up first.
You ready?

35:16.648 --> 35:18.550
- Hell yeah!
- Let's do this.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.219
- I know it's pretty heavy.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.820
I'm really hopg
all that weight

35:21.853 --> 35:23.455
from the art and
the sculpture I put into it

35:23.489 --> 35:24.456
isn't going to
bite me in the ass.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.294
[suspenseful music]

35:28.327 --> 35:31.263
[heavy rock music]

35:31.297 --> 35:37.669
*

35:37.703 --> 35:39.571
[pensive music]

35:39.605 --> 35:41.673
- Well, Zack, that's a hog.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.242
This is a hog.
- [chuckles]

35:43.275 --> 35:45.677
- It is heavy,
but it's powerful.

35:45.711 --> 35:49.315
The curve you have in here
digs deep into the chops.

35:49.348 --> 35:52.218
Here it lacerated
the spine easily.

35:52.251 --> 35:56.255
Overall, your weapon will kill.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.190
Frank, Nehemiah, your turn.
You ready?

35:58.224 --> 35:59.425
[together]
Lay on.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.659
- Let's do this.

36:00.692 --> 36:03.495
[soft dramatic music]

36:03.529 --> 36:04.863
*

36:04.896 --> 36:07.833
[heavy rock music]

36:07.866 --> 36:14.873
*

36:14.906 --> 36:16.608
[suspenseful music]

36:16.642 --> 36:19.245
Frank, Nehemiah, it's light.

36:19.278 --> 36:22.414
So I can go hog wild
on this carcass.

36:22.448 --> 36:25.917
When you dig in,
it cuts into the spine,

36:25.951 --> 36:29.455
and into the ribs,
and lacerates quite well.

36:29.488 --> 36:31.957
Your Nzappa zap will kill.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.392
*

36:33.425 --> 36:35.361
- The pig that Zack's weapon hit

36:35.394 --> 36:36.928
might have opened up
a little bit more,

36:36.962 --> 36:39.431
but the truth is
the wounds were just as deep

36:39.465 --> 36:41.667
and just as bad.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.635
- Next up is the strength test.

36:43.669 --> 36:46.638
Occasionally, the Nzappa zap
was also thrown.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.375
So, to test the strength
and durability of your weapons,

36:49.408 --> 36:52.744
I'm going to throw them into
this wooden target three times.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.613
Zack, you're up.
You ready?

36:54.646 --> 36:56.815
- Be gentle.
- [chuckles]

36:56.848 --> 36:58.684
I'm never gentle.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.652
[dramatic rock music]

37:00.686 --> 37:04.656
[soft suspenseful music]

37:04.690 --> 37:05.991
- Yeah.
- Huzzah!

37:06.024 --> 37:09.661
*

37:09.695 --> 37:10.862
- Nice.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.799
[dramatic music pounds]

37:13.832 --> 37:17.436
*

37:17.469 --> 37:19.338
Yeah.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.707
[tense music]

37:21.740 --> 37:24.276
*

37:24.310 --> 37:26.845
- All right, Zack.
It's still tight.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.847
Nothing loosened up.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.317
But right here,
there's a section of that blade

37:31.350 --> 37:33.719
that's just not as sharp
as the rest of it.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.621
There's a roll to that edge.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.022
And that's pretty much

37:37.055 --> 37:38.924
right where
it dug into the wall.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.492
*

37:40.526 --> 37:42.060
Frank, Nehemiah,
you're up next.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.495
- Lay on.

37:43.529 --> 37:46.465
[dramatic music]

37:46.498 --> 37:53.405
*

38:04.350 --> 38:07.052
[tense music]

38:07.085 --> 38:10.589
*

38:10.622 --> 38:12.391
- You can see right here,

38:12.424 --> 38:15.327
the handle hit
the target at its rotation,

38:15.361 --> 38:18.430
but nothing's wrong
with this blade.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.599
It held up.
Nicely done, guys.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.568
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.536
- Anybody who actually
has thrown weapons,

38:24.570 --> 38:27.473
you know that
the handles are disposable.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.007
But the metal?
No.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.843
The metal's designed
to not take the damage.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.845
- Next up, the sharpness test.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.415
We're going to see how well
those blade edges held up.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.983
I'm going to cut
each one of these ropes.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.951
The meat will drop.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.620
And I'll cut into each one
of those pieces of meat.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.121
Zack, you're up first.
You ready?

38:43.154 --> 38:44.790
- Yes, sir.
- Kay.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.492
- I do feel like
me, Frank, and Nehemiah

38:46.525 --> 38:48.093
are all neck-and-neck.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.462
It's definitely
a tight race right now.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.664
I've never known what "weak
in the knees" means before,

38:52.698 --> 38:57.869
but, actually,
my knees almost hurt.

38:57.903 --> 38:58.937
[heavy rock music]

39:00.672 --> 39:07.613
*

39:12.150 --> 39:14.720
[tense music]

39:14.753 --> 39:16.422
- All right, Zack.

39:16.455 --> 39:19.057
Though your blade
is sharp in most places,

39:19.090 --> 39:20.926
that roll you picked up,

39:20.959 --> 39:22.628
I think that's what stopped it

39:22.661 --> 39:23.895
from going through
the rope immediately.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.697
But the second cut,

39:25.731 --> 39:27.433
I caught it
down in here somewhere.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.034
And it just went right through.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.470
All in all, that's a cutter.

39:31.503 --> 39:32.504
- Thank you.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.706
- Frank, Nehemiah.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.841
[together]
Lay on.

39:35.874 --> 39:36.908
- [soft chuckle]

39:36.942 --> 39:39.878
[dramatic music]

39:39.911 --> 39:42.080
*

39:42.113 --> 39:45.016
[heavy rock music]

39:45.050 --> 39:52.090
*

39:52.123 --> 39:54.426
[suspenseful music]

39:54.460 --> 39:56.428
For cutting rope right off,

39:56.462 --> 40:00.065
this divot in the middle here
actually worked very well.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.100
The handle,
where it broke on the throw,

40:02.133 --> 40:03.535
didn't bother me at all.

40:03.569 --> 40:05.971
It's below where my hand sits.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.539
It's a cutter.

40:07.573 --> 40:08.607
Nicely done.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.142
[dramatic music]

40:11.176 --> 40:13.479
- Bladesmiths, what
started out as a competition

40:13.512 --> 40:16.482
focused on masters and
apprentices working together

40:16.515 --> 40:18.550
turned into an apprentice
going against

40:18.584 --> 40:20.819
a master
and his student.

40:20.852 --> 40:23.054
You rolled with it,
and here we are.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.057
The judges have made
their final decision.

40:26.091 --> 40:29.461
And the master and apprentice
"Forged in Fire" champion title

40:29.495 --> 40:30.629
goes to...

40:30.662 --> 40:33.532
[dramatic music pounds]

40:33.565 --> 40:35.967
*

40:36.001 --> 40:38.203
Frank and Nehemiah,
congratulations.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.639
You are the "Forged in Fire"
master and apprentice champions.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.608
Good job.
- Thank you.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.777
- Zack, unfortunately,
your blade did not make the cut.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.212
- Zack, first,
let me commend you

40:47.245 --> 40:48.647
for just pushing
through this solo.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.882
- Thank you, sir.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.684
- You gave us a lot of artistry
in the forging of your blade.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.953
And that's very impressive
for an apprentice.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.523
But that roll you picked up
in the strength test,

40:57.556 --> 40:59.891
combined with that
extreme weight of that piece,

40:59.925 --> 41:01.793
made it very hard to wield.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.028
And that's why
we're letting you go.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.963
- Understandable.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.565
- Zack, you got the heart
of a lion, brother.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.099
- Thank you.
- But at this time,

41:08.133 --> 41:10.669
I have to asyou
to please surrender your weapon.

41:10.702 --> 41:12.504
- Right now, I'm pretty bummed.

41:12.538 --> 41:14.039
But Jesse ought to be proud

41:14.072 --> 41:16.508
that I persevered
and stuck through this.

41:16.542 --> 41:19.044
Hell, I made it this far, and
I feel like I did pretty good.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.814
I'm a winner in my own heart.

41:22.848 --> 41:25.183
- Frank, Nehemiah,
congratulations.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.085
You are the
master and apprentice

41:27.118 --> 41:29.855
"Forged in Fire" champions.
Good job.

41:29.888 --> 41:33.291
That title also comes
with a check for $10,000.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.060
All right, gentlemen.

41:35.093 --> 41:36.595
Please present your weapon
to the judges.

41:36.628 --> 41:37.929
- Apprentice.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.865
We won! Yay!
- [laughs]

41:39.898 --> 41:42.133
We're the first
master and apprentice champions.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.135
- I am extremely proud
of Nehemiah.

41:44.169 --> 41:47.573
Him and I sharing this, that's
what I really do this for.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.174
I think the zapper zap that we--

41:49.207 --> 41:51.176
Nzappa?

41:51.209 --> 41:53.645
I think the Nzappa zap
represents exactly us.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.947
And that's why I'm very happy
and very proud of it.

41:55.981 --> 41:58.950

41:58.984 --> 42:00.752
