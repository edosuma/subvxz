-Oh, honey, are you okay?

08:43.742 --> 08:45.810
Eh, a rest
will do you good.

08:51.183 --> 08:52.784
G-Granny Jojo,
you don't get it!

08:52.817 --> 08:56.121
I may not,
but she certainly will!

08:56.155 --> 08:57.156
What the...

08:57.189 --> 08:59.191
[ Bird coos ]
Ahh!

08:59.224 --> 09:02.794
That's the exact opposite of the
message I was trying to send!

09:02.827 --> 09:05.097
You don't understand.
Muriel doesn't exist.

09:05.130 --> 09:08.367
-We made her up.
-No-o-o-o-o!

09:08.400 --> 09:10.535
-Eh?
-...problem then.

09:10.569 --> 09:12.937
-Well, then, who's that?
-We just used her photo.

09:12.971 --> 09:15.674
We made her up so Grandpa Louie
could have a friend online.

09:15.707 --> 09:17.642
What?! Do you know
what a cat and a fish

09:17.676 --> 09:20.645
pretending to be someone else
online is called?

09:20.679 --> 09:22.047
Catfishing?

09:22.081 --> 09:23.348
No! It's called --

09:23.382 --> 09:25.784
Wait. Actually, yes,
that is what it's called.

09:25.817 --> 09:27.886
But if we lied
to make you happier,

09:27.919 --> 09:29.354
is that really so wrong?

09:29.388 --> 09:31.156
It is
literally illegal.

09:31.190 --> 09:32.357
None of this
would have happened

09:32.391 --> 09:34.526
if Granny Jojo
wasn't so controlling.

What are you
talking about?

Thank you
for your advice, Doc.

I'll make sure
to eat more fiber next time.

You're even jealous
of the X's in my X-rays.

10:07.092 --> 10:09.828
Then why did you want to be more
than just friends with Muriel?

10:09.861 --> 10:12.697
I meant more than
just Elmore Plus friends --

10:12.731 --> 10:15.567
a friend in real life.
You must admit

10:15.600 --> 10:18.503
you don't really let me see
my other friends anymore.

I love you so much, Louie.

10:29.848 --> 10:32.016
Grandpa Louie's
allowed to have friends?

10:32.050 --> 10:34.085
Maybe just one.
