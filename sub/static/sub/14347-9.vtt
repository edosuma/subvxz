00:26.701 --> 00:27.801
Detective Gavin.

00:27.836 --> 00:29.001
Timo, what's new?

00:29.036 --> 00:30.132
Nothin' so far.

00:30.167 --> 00:31.901
What about
the two sisters we pulled out?

00:31.936 --> 00:32.866
They know anything?

00:32.901 --> 00:34.499
Probably,
but they're scared.

00:34.525 --> 00:35.898
A couple runaways
hooked on crack.

00:35.928 --> 00:38.124
The last thing they want
to do is talk to a cop.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.766
- Where are they?
- Tommy...

00:39.801 --> 00:42.667
Brother, I'd do anything
to help you out, but I just--

00:42.702 --> 00:45.267
Yeah? Then do it.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.265
Listen, I gotta know

00:49.300 --> 00:50.534
how that fire
got started, okay?

00:50.569 --> 00:52.067
Not for me.
For Billy.

00:52.102 --> 00:53.365
The two girls,

00:53.395 --> 00:55.417
they're living in another
abandoned building in Harlem.

00:55.460 --> 00:56.438
What's the address?

00:57.400 --> 01:01.367
Do not do anything stupid,
Tommy.

01:01.402 --> 01:02.799
Now, you got a pen?

01:02.834 --> 01:05.132
Great.
Everybody except Tommy.

01:05.168 --> 01:06.265
Where's the probie?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.634
- Silletti!
- Get in here. Come on.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.567
Sorry, I was taking a leak.

01:10.602 --> 01:11.601
Yeah, you are a leak.

01:11.636 --> 01:12.566
All right,
guys, look,

01:12.601 --> 01:13.965
I wanted to get you together

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
because we have a situation
that's arised-- arose--

01:17.035 --> 01:18.165
it's pretty important.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.233
- It's "arisen," chief.
- Shut up.

01:20.268 --> 01:22.232
- Is he right?
- Amazingly, yes. How?

01:22.267 --> 01:24.400
I've been banging this chick--
plays a lot of Scrabble.

01:24.435 --> 01:27.133
Hey, did you know that q-a-t
is a word?

01:27.168 --> 01:28.499
- Shut up.
- I swear.

01:28.534 --> 01:30.599
- I said shut up.
- All right.

01:30.634 --> 01:32.833
Look, after we lost
Billy, the boroughs tell me

01:32.868 --> 01:35.033
that they're gonna send
a transfer down here soon,

01:35.068 --> 01:36.367
and it's happening.

01:36.402 --> 01:37.717
Goddamn bastards.

01:37.752 --> 01:39.033
What's going on?

01:40.601 --> 01:41.965
We're gettin' a dame.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.601
What?
What is this, some kind of joke?

01:43.636 --> 01:44.666
Are you serious?

01:44.701 --> 01:46.234
We can't have a chick
around here.

01:46.269 --> 01:47.767
No way, chief.
No goddamn way!

01:47.802 --> 01:49.965
Over my dead body.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.599
It just come straight
from the mayor's office.

01:51.634 --> 01:54.634
They want to make four part-time
girls firefighters as of now.

01:54.669 --> 01:57.234
We're gonna get this broad
by the next set of tours.

01:57.269 --> 01:59.132
It's not gonna work,
okay?

01:59.167 --> 02:00.767
I mean, having a woman
in the firehouse,

02:00.802 --> 02:02.784
i-i-it's destructive.

02:02.819 --> 02:04.767
I-i-it's disruptive.

02:06.267 --> 02:08.667
I mean, look, we got
a dynamic going on here.

02:08.702 --> 02:11.067
- You can't mess with that.
- Calm down, Kenny.

02:11.102 --> 02:12.632
Don't tell me
to calm down, okay?

02:12.667 --> 02:14.667
It's not even about having
a woman in the firehouse.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.667
It's about the fact that
they can't pass the physical.

02:16.702 --> 02:17.933
- Right.
- It's about the fact

02:17.968 --> 02:20.200
that the bean counters downtown
lower their standards

02:20.235 --> 02:22.767
so they can fill
their goddamn bitch quota.

02:22.802 --> 02:23.965
Yeah, like they
give a shit.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.566
We're the ones
that are gonna wind up

02:25.601 --> 02:27.400
catching the second alarm
on one of these broads.

02:27.435 --> 02:28.801
She's gonna break a nail,
freak out,

02:28.836 --> 02:29.965
and we'll wind up
dead, chief.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.467
All right, look, jeez,
calm down, huh?

02:31.502 --> 02:32.833
Settle down here.

02:32.868 --> 02:35.701
Hey, chief, you got any idea
who it's gonna be?

02:35.736 --> 02:37.667
Well, you know,
there are four choices,

02:37.702 --> 02:38.866
and I got
a funny feelin'

02:38.901 --> 02:41.000
you guys are not gonna
appreciate any of them.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.199
Oh, try us.

02:42.234 --> 02:44.701
Well, the first one's
a black midget.

02:45.801 --> 02:47.098
I'm sorry, what?

02:47.133 --> 02:48.399
Well, she's not actually
a midget,

02:48.434 --> 02:50.434
but she just barely
met the height requirement,

02:50.469 --> 02:51.535
and she's black.

02:51.570 --> 02:52.685
Oh, that's great.

02:52.720 --> 02:53.766
So we can lift her up

02:53.801 --> 02:55.334
when she's gotta use
the sink.

02:55.369 --> 02:56.368
That's beautiful.

02:56.403 --> 02:57.332
Who's number two?

02:57.367 --> 02:58.766
A gigantic
Norwegian chick.

02:58.801 --> 03:00.934
I'm told she's just shy
of 6'5", a big one.

03:02.267 --> 03:03.567
Who's bachelorette
number three?

03:03.602 --> 03:04.965
Some dyke.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.933
Yeah, they're probably
all dykes.

03:06.968 --> 03:08.567
No, no, there's no "probably"
about this one.

03:08.602 --> 03:09.799
I've seen a picture,

03:09.834 --> 03:11.834
and she's more of a man
than I'll ever be.

03:11.869 --> 03:13.285
Now, the fourth choice--

03:13.320 --> 03:14.666
I don't want
to know, okay?

03:14.701 --> 03:17.067
They want to send us a dame,
send us a dame.

03:17.102 --> 03:18.551
You know what we're gonna do?

03:18.586 --> 03:19.965
We're gonna freeze her ass out.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.200
The second she walks
in that door...

03:22.235 --> 03:24.032
- Yeah.
- ... ice, totally.

03:24.067 --> 03:25.267
She's not gonna last
two days.

03:25.302 --> 03:26.534
- Ice.
- Ooh...

03:26.569 --> 03:27.767
Yes, ice.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.760
ALARM

04:34.167 --> 04:35.834
Hey. Hey!

04:35.869 --> 04:37.766
Hey!

04:37.801 --> 04:39.351
Remember me?

04:39.386 --> 04:40.776
You a cop?

04:40.811 --> 04:42.132
No, a fireman.

04:42.167 --> 04:44.400
Pulled you out of that building
a couple nights ago.

04:44.435 --> 04:46.732
What fire?

04:46.767 --> 04:48.165
Don't talk to him, G.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.868
We lost a good man in that fire.

04:51.567 --> 04:54.267
So? Go find him.

04:58.801 --> 04:59.833
- Bitch.
- Police!

04:59.868 --> 05:00.901
Yeah, call for the cops!

05:00.936 --> 05:01.899
That's what they love.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.132
They love little crybaby
crackheads.

05:04.167 --> 05:07.033
Let me tell you about the man
you killed in that fire, bitch.

05:07.068 --> 05:09.100
I swear, it was Jacob.

05:09.135 --> 05:10.632
Who's Jacob?

05:10.667 --> 05:12.332
We needed a place

05:12.367 --> 05:14.734
and he took us
where he was staying.

05:14.769 --> 05:17.098
He took me
in the corner and...

05:17.133 --> 05:20.400
he said that I had
to go down on him,

05:20.435 --> 05:22.034
so I fought him.

05:22.069 --> 05:23.599
I grabbed a candle

05:23.634 --> 05:25.901
and his shirt
caught on fire.

05:25.936 --> 05:28.051
Everything just burned.

05:28.086 --> 05:29.943
We tried to stop it.

05:29.978 --> 05:31.801
It was Jacob's fault.

05:31.836 --> 05:33.801
Where is he?

05:33.836 --> 05:35.651
Where is he?

05:35.686 --> 05:37.660
I don't know.

05:37.695 --> 05:39.599
All right.

05:39.634 --> 05:43.065
I got 80 bucks here.

05:43.100 --> 05:46.467
Tell me
how I can find him.

05:46.502 --> 05:47.532
There's this place

05:47.567 --> 05:51.267
two blocks up,
this side of the street,

05:51.302 --> 05:52.799
two, three doors in,

05:52.834 --> 05:54.968
big orange "H"
on one of the windows.

05:55.003 --> 05:56.802
He's there now?

05:56.837 --> 05:58.566
He's not there now.

05:58.601 --> 05:59.801
He goes out during the day.

05:59.836 --> 06:00.799
Tonight.

06:00.834 --> 06:01.967
He'll be there tonight.

06:02.002 --> 06:03.868
What does he look like?

06:03.903 --> 06:05.699
He's got this afro,

06:05.734 --> 06:07.234
and he's always wearing
sunglasses.

06:10.601 --> 06:12.399
- Thanks.
- Hey!

06:12.434 --> 06:13.434
What about the money?

06:13.469 --> 06:16.234
Hey, asshole!

06:16.269 --> 06:17.899
Whoo!

06:17.934 --> 06:18.899
Good news, boys.

06:18.934 --> 06:20.566
It's about 9,000 degrees
outside.

06:20.601 --> 06:24.033
The paper said it could
get up to 105 by noon.

06:24.068 --> 06:25.550
Great day to carry
45 pounds of gear

06:25.585 --> 06:27.009
up and down
10 flights of stairs.

06:27.044 --> 06:28.434
You know what they need
to invent?

06:28.469 --> 06:29.766
Shorts, bunker shorts.

06:29.801 --> 06:31.767
There's a little problem
of your legs burnin' off.

06:31.802 --> 06:34.001
Well, it's better
than sweating my balls off.

06:34.036 --> 06:36.200
So your balls are
more important than your legs?

06:36.235 --> 06:37.801
Well, you see,
you can get fake legs.

06:37.836 --> 06:38.868
See, now, he's got a point.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.367
Hey, Kenny,
got a tip on the game.

06:44.402 --> 06:45.566
Oh?

06:45.601 --> 06:47.201
Yeah, a friend of a friend
knows the physician

06:47.231 --> 06:49.005
who's treating the starting
pitcher for Anaheim.

06:49.032 --> 06:49.963
The guy's in severe pain.

06:50.003 --> 06:51.065
He needs shoulder surgery

06:51.100 --> 06:52.634
like I need
to lose 50 pounds.

06:52.669 --> 06:53.599
You know what?

06:53.634 --> 06:55.467
We could both lose
a few pounds, pal.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.766
Tell me about it.

06:56.801 --> 06:58.434
I'm just comin' off
that cabbage soup diet.

06:58.469 --> 06:59.899
Cabbage soup?

06:59.934 --> 07:01.334
Yeah, you eat nothin'
but cabbage soup

07:01.369 --> 07:02.399
for a month.

07:02.434 --> 07:04.434
You shit so much,
you could fit in a shoebox.

07:04.469 --> 07:05.632
How much you lose?

07:05.667 --> 07:08.200
I didn't lose anything.
I gained four pounds.

07:08.235 --> 07:10.734
Anyway, this guy doesn't want
to go on the D.L.

07:10.769 --> 07:12.699
because he'll be
a free agent soon.

07:12.734 --> 07:14.599
I'm bettin' the farm on it.
You want in?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.801
No, thanks, chief,
I don't have the spare cash now.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.599
Kenny, this is a mortal lock.

07:18.634 --> 07:21.334
The last mortal lock you gave me
cost me 100 bones.

07:21.369 --> 07:22.801
That was based
on bad information.

07:22.836 --> 07:24.300
This is the real deal.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.567
Good luck.

07:26.602 --> 07:27.834
Suit yourself.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.367
Son of a bitch.

07:50.367 --> 07:51.532
Agh!

07:51.567 --> 07:53.067
Yeah, you better run.

07:53.102 --> 07:55.100
Goddamn it.

07:55.135 --> 07:56.701
Ah.

07:56.736 --> 07:58.232
Great.

07:58.267 --> 07:59.933
Just great.

07:59.968 --> 08:02.167
Pain in the ass.

08:08.267 --> 08:09.400
Yeah?

08:09.435 --> 08:10.518
Oh.

08:10.553 --> 08:11.566
Whew.

08:11.601 --> 08:13.933
Oh, thank you
for coming over.

08:13.968 --> 08:17.267
It's that thing down in the
basement, the central air thing?

08:17.302 --> 08:19.267
I went down there,
and it's hot to the touch.

08:19.302 --> 08:20.451
Yeah, you know what?

08:20.486 --> 08:21.566
It's an old unit.

08:21.601 --> 08:22.868
Probably gonna have to
replace it.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.634
With what money?

08:24.669 --> 08:26.666
Ah...

08:26.701 --> 08:29.234
I am just saying I don't have
the money right now.

08:29.269 --> 08:30.299
So what you're really saying

08:30.334 --> 08:31.734
is I don't give you
enough money.

08:31.769 --> 08:33.097
No, that is not what I said.

08:33.147 --> 08:34.409
That is exactly
what you're saying.

08:34.453 --> 08:35.726
I'm not in the mood for this.

08:35.769 --> 08:37.032
Oh, yeah, and I am?

08:37.067 --> 08:38.666
I have to pick up
Conner and Katy,

08:38.701 --> 08:40.734
and I've had to deal
with your older daughter today.

08:40.769 --> 08:41.965
What's going on with her?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.801
She wants to bring
her special friend over here.

08:43.836 --> 08:44.998
Her girlfriend?

08:45.033 --> 08:47.000
I will not refer to that person
as her girlfriend.

08:47.035 --> 08:48.968
Okay, they were caught
making out together at school.

08:49.003 --> 08:51.267
That would make her
pretty much the girlfriend.

08:51.302 --> 08:53.334
Whatever.
It is not happening in my house.

08:53.369 --> 08:55.367
Look, I'm not exactly doin'
a jig over here

08:55.430 --> 08:56.761
because she's turned into
a lesbo.

08:56.811 --> 08:58.074
Tom, she is not a lesbian!

08:58.102 --> 08:59.399
She has a girlfriend!

08:59.434 --> 09:01.434
She is 15 years old.
She's only had one boyfriend.

09:01.469 --> 09:03.467
When she's had to deal
with five or six guys,

09:03.502 --> 09:04.899
then I can see her going gay.

09:04.934 --> 09:06.934
All I'm saying is
I'm not judging her, all right?

09:06.969 --> 09:09.868
You actually want her
to be a lesbian.

09:09.903 --> 09:11.065
- What?
- Then you you don't have

09:11.100 --> 09:12.683
to worry about her
having sex with a boy.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.267
Tom, it has probably
already happened.

09:14.302 --> 09:15.599
Oh, bullshit.

09:15.634 --> 09:17.399
When was the first time
that you had sex?

09:17.434 --> 09:19.467
- What does that have to do--?
- What was her name?

09:19.502 --> 09:20.901
- Patty Brennan.
- How old were you?

09:20.936 --> 09:22.165
- Fourteen.
- And?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.467
Completely different story.

09:23.502 --> 09:24.799
How?

09:24.834 --> 09:26.817
Completely different story.
Patty Brennan was-was--

09:26.852 --> 09:28.801
First of all, her parents
fought like cats and dogs,

09:28.836 --> 09:30.833
they got divorced,
they split up,

09:30.868 --> 09:32.467
so she basically came
from a broken home,

09:32.502 --> 09:33.699
her father was an alcoholic,

09:33.734 --> 09:35.934
and she was sleeping with me
to get back at him.

09:35.969 --> 09:37.133
Oh.

09:47.701 --> 09:48.767
Hi.

09:48.802 --> 09:49.799
Hey.

09:49.834 --> 09:50.868
Am I in the wrong--

09:50.903 --> 09:52.067
Hey, babe!

09:53.334 --> 09:55.332
- Hi.
- How are you?

09:55.367 --> 09:58.065
This is my daughter,
Nicole,

09:58.100 --> 10:00.501
who just showed up
at my door an hour ago,

10:00.536 --> 10:01.499
telling me
she needs

10:01.534 --> 10:03.350
a place to stay
for a week.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.132
I told you
a month ago.

10:05.167 --> 10:06.968
You said you might be
coming to New York

10:07.003 --> 10:09.167
and you might need
a place to stay.

10:09.202 --> 10:10.699
I told you this week,

10:10.734 --> 10:13.132
and I know Dad
left you a message.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.917
I don't listen
to your father's messages.

10:14.952 --> 10:16.667
Whenever I hear his voice
on my machine,

10:16.702 --> 10:17.667
I hit the erase button.

10:17.702 --> 10:18.766
You know that.

10:18.801 --> 10:21.701
You are such
a goddamn bitch.

10:27.133 --> 10:29.834
Do you, uh, want a soda?

10:31.567 --> 10:33.566
...is
ready, and now delivers...

10:33.601 --> 10:35.834
Why don't you stand in front
of the entire television?

10:35.869 --> 10:37.634
It's not like I'm trying
to watch the game

10:37.669 --> 10:38.732
or anything.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.299
This cabinet's
packed to the gills.

10:40.334 --> 10:43.566
Can't you do that one of
the 14 hours I'm not here?

10:43.601 --> 10:47.200
Maybe if you cleaned it out
one of the 14 times I asked you,

10:47.235 --> 10:48.484
I wouldn't
have to do it.

10:48.519 --> 10:49.734
Just move your fat ass, huh?

10:49.769 --> 10:52.165
Excuse me?

10:52.200 --> 10:56.033
I love you, sweetie,
but move.

11:00.934 --> 11:03.534
...it's four to nothing,
Anaheim,

11:03.569 --> 11:04.901
as we go
to the eighth.

11:04.936 --> 11:06.434
Oh, Christ!

11:08.334 --> 11:09.666
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:09.701 --> 11:11.117
What are you doing here?

11:11.152 --> 11:12.576
Fixing the air for your mom.

11:12.611 --> 11:14.000
Where you going in that outfit?

11:14.035 --> 11:15.098
To Jennifer's.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.734
I wanted to invite her
over here tonight,

11:16.769 --> 11:18.133
but Mom's totally freaking out.

11:18.168 --> 11:19.098
You know what?

11:19.133 --> 11:20.583
If you want
to invite her over,

11:20.618 --> 11:22.033
just invite her
over to my place.

11:22.068 --> 11:23.632
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.567
- That would be okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.432
I'm happy
that you're happy, okay?

11:27.467 --> 11:29.934
I don't have hang-ups
like certain other people.

11:29.969 --> 11:31.168
Thanks, Daddy.

11:31.203 --> 11:32.335
You're welcome.

11:32.370 --> 11:33.568
I love you.

11:33.603 --> 11:34.732
Hey, here.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.200
Why don't you...

11:37.467 --> 11:40.067
take Jennifer out
for a burger tonight?

11:40.102 --> 11:41.200
You're the best.

11:41.235 --> 11:42.567
See you.

11:45.033 --> 11:48.133
Yes, I am the best.

12:04.367 --> 12:05.417
Hello?

12:05.452 --> 12:06.432
Kenny?

12:06.467 --> 12:07.868
This is Sondra,
Billy's wife--

12:07.903 --> 12:09.001
ex-wife.

12:09.036 --> 12:10.065
Oh, hi.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.133
What can I do
for you?

12:12.168 --> 12:13.232
Who is it?

12:13.267 --> 12:14.632
It's Billy's widow.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.868
Oh, my God.
That poor thing.

12:15.903 --> 12:16.965
It's about the poem

12:17.000 --> 12:18.867
- that you read at the service.
- Yeah?

12:18.902 --> 12:20.699
Well, someone told me
you wrote it,

12:20.734 --> 12:24.300
and I just wanted to say
I thought it was moving.

12:24.335 --> 12:25.332
Oh, really?

12:25.367 --> 12:26.632
Oh, thanks a lot.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.667
And I'd like to hear
some more of it.

12:28.702 --> 12:30.732
Well, uh...

12:30.767 --> 12:33.667
you know,
if you wanted to, I could...

12:33.702 --> 12:35.534
I could e-mail you some more.

12:35.569 --> 12:36.998
Yeah, yeah.

12:37.033 --> 12:38.616
That would be wonderful.

12:38.651 --> 12:40.200
What's your address?

12:49.200 --> 12:50.332
Hey.

12:50.367 --> 12:51.432
Where's my mom?

12:51.467 --> 12:53.200
Um, she went to sleep.

12:53.235 --> 12:54.200
Shh.

13:04.334 --> 13:05.334
Good night.

13:06.601 --> 13:08.234
Night.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.667
- Hey, Tommy, good news.
- What?

13:18.702 --> 13:19.667
The black midget's out.

13:19.702 --> 13:20.732
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.532
Apparently, a couple
of the guys from her house

13:22.567 --> 13:24.866
stuffed her into a garbage can,
took her for a roll.

13:24.901 --> 13:27.300
She's filing a multi-million
dollar lawsuit against the city.

13:27.335 --> 13:28.699
- Nice.
- Yeah.

13:28.734 --> 13:30.934
Now we don't have to raise
all the shelves up higher.

13:30.969 --> 13:32.098
Looks like we're down

13:32.133 --> 13:33.934
to the gigantic Norwegian
and the other two chicks.

13:33.969 --> 13:35.767
Really? Hey, let me
ask you something.

13:35.808 --> 13:36.991
Know anything
about these things?

13:37.036 --> 13:37.562
What?

13:37.622 --> 13:39.171
- Pregnancy test things?
- No, not really.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.200
I think one of my girlfriends
used one once, why?

13:41.235 --> 13:42.365
Because I'm trying
to figure out

13:42.400 --> 13:44.000
if the pink means pregnant
or not pregnant.

13:44.035 --> 13:45.232
No, I can't
tell you, man.

13:45.278 --> 13:48.188
I remember holding a stick
and her peeing on my hand.

13:48.233 --> 13:49.692
She couldn't hold
the stick herself?

13:49.769 --> 13:51.499
Ah, she said
she got nervous.

13:51.534 --> 13:53.334
I think she was into
those golden shower things.

13:53.369 --> 13:54.499
Really?
Why do you say that?

13:54.534 --> 13:57.334
We were fooling around
in the shower one time,

13:57.369 --> 13:58.799
and she peed on me.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.384
You let a chick piss on you?

14:00.419 --> 14:01.934
She said it was an accident.

14:01.969 --> 14:03.268
- Where?
- On my leg.

14:03.303 --> 14:04.532
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:04.567 --> 14:06.367
- You piss on her?
- You're goddamn right I did.

14:06.402 --> 14:07.584
- She like it?
- She loved it.

14:07.619 --> 14:08.767
- Where?
- Kind of all over.

14:08.802 --> 14:09.767
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:09.802 --> 14:10.732
Hey.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.300
What are you doing with that?

14:12.335 --> 14:13.365
None of your business.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.100
Hey, kid, you know
what pink means?

14:15.135 --> 14:16.801
Sure.
Pink means you're pregnant.

14:19.667 --> 14:20.632
Thanks, man.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.033
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.300
Oh, Jesus, it's so hot,
I can hardly see straight.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.334
I could go for a cold beer
right about now.

14:31.369 --> 14:32.299
Yeah, I'm in.

14:32.334 --> 14:33.399
Nah. I gotta get home.

14:33.434 --> 14:35.098
Paula's makin' a casserole.

14:35.133 --> 14:36.968
Yeah, well, nobody asked you,
but okay.

14:37.003 --> 14:38.167
You still bangin'
that old broad?

14:38.202 --> 14:39.167
How's that going?

14:39.215 --> 14:39.850
Good.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.178
I mean,
her apartment's great,

14:41.239 --> 14:42.664
but her daughter's
staying with us,

14:42.695 --> 14:44.630
- and I think she wants me.
- What makes you think that?

14:44.669 --> 14:45.965
She told me.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.033
Wow. Mother-daughter combo.
That's hot, huh?

14:48.068 --> 14:49.499
I wouldn't pass that up.

14:49.534 --> 14:51.367
No way, man.
I can't risk it.

14:51.402 --> 14:53.165
I got no other place to stay.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.200
Yeah, well, if you find yourself
in a tight spot,

14:55.235 --> 14:56.634
don't be afraid
to call for backup.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.667
Hey, girls.

15:02.702 --> 15:03.965
Hey, Dad.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.400
- You must be Jennifer.
- Hi, Mr. Gavin.

15:05.435 --> 15:06.801
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

15:06.836 --> 15:07.818
What's goin' on?

15:07.853 --> 15:08.801
Nothin' much.

15:09.901 --> 15:12.100
Dad, it smells like
dog poop in here.

15:12.135 --> 15:14.499
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

15:14.534 --> 15:17.200
We're just gonna grab
a couple of sodas

15:17.235 --> 15:18.434
and watch TV,
if that's okay.

15:18.469 --> 15:19.532
That's fine.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.667
Is that a pregnancy test?

15:24.033 --> 15:25.467
Yeah, actually, it is.

15:25.502 --> 15:27.332
What's going on?

15:27.367 --> 15:29.367
Well, I was about to ask you
the same question.

15:29.402 --> 15:30.965
What?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.601
I found this
over at your mother's house.

15:32.636 --> 15:34.133
It's not mine.

15:34.168 --> 15:35.098
You sure?

15:35.133 --> 15:36.567
Dad, I couldn't
be pregnant.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.133
I've never had sex.

15:38.168 --> 15:39.599
I mean...

15:39.634 --> 15:41.265
that kind of sex.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.567
What about
the Murphy kid?

15:43.602 --> 15:44.699
Never.

15:44.734 --> 15:46.299
Did you see him again
after the accident?

15:46.334 --> 15:49.234
I'm not gonna be pissed off.
I just want to know the truth.

15:49.269 --> 15:52.400
I saw him one time
after the accident,

15:52.435 --> 15:53.666
and that's all,

15:53.701 --> 15:55.200
and there was
no sex involved,

15:55.235 --> 15:56.632
not even a kiss.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.365
You saw him
after the accident?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.834
It was, like,
for two seconds, though.

16:00.869 --> 16:01.899
It was nothing.

16:01.934 --> 16:03.567
Well, I asked you
if you saw him.

16:03.602 --> 16:04.699
It didn't
mean anything.

16:04.734 --> 16:06.399
I just didn't want you
to get mad.

16:06.434 --> 16:09.467
God, Coll, if I wanted to hear
lies and shit,

16:09.502 --> 16:10.968
I'd be going out with a guy.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.434
Hey, watch
your language.

16:12.469 --> 16:13.501
Jennifer!

16:16.901 --> 16:18.817
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks a lot.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.699
Hey, don't blame me, okay?

16:20.734 --> 16:22.599
You can't have
successful relationships

16:22.634 --> 16:24.767
when you go around
lying to people like that.

16:24.802 --> 16:26.499
Oh!

16:26.534 --> 16:28.000
It's true.

16:30.234 --> 16:32.332
- Yeah?
- Yeah, this is J.R.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.968
Give me a thousand
on New York tonight.

16:34.003 --> 16:36.098
- Can't do it.
- What do you mean?

16:36.133 --> 16:38.750
You gotta pay
for the last shipment first.

16:38.785 --> 16:41.367
Huh? Wha-- Are you guys
pullin' my puddin'?

16:41.402 --> 16:42.551
What are you talkin' about?

16:42.586 --> 16:43.743
You went over your limit.

16:43.778 --> 16:44.866
You have to pay by Friday.

16:44.901 --> 16:46.501
Let me talk to Salvio.
Is he there?

16:46.536 --> 16:47.632
Hey, no names.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.467
By Friday, the full amount.

16:50.501 --> 16:52.000
Hey! Hey!

16:53.100 --> 16:55.534
Rat bastards.

17:05.501 --> 17:07.367
Grab me a bottle?

17:08.666 --> 17:10.567
Yeah, of course.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.032
Where's your mom?

17:16.068 --> 17:17.267
In bed.

17:18.534 --> 17:21.201
So you're just hangin' out?

17:21.236 --> 17:23.451
There's no A.C. in my room.

17:23.486 --> 17:25.632
It's like a sauna in there.

17:25.666 --> 17:27.733
You can sleep with your mom
if you want.

17:27.769 --> 17:29.384
I can crash on the couch.

17:29.419 --> 17:30.965
Let me ask you something.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.634
What are you doing with my mom?

17:33.934 --> 17:36.033
Well, she's cool, you know?
I mean...

17:37.868 --> 17:39.267
Mike...

17:39.302 --> 17:40.632
Mm?

17:40.667 --> 17:42.100
Do you think I'm hot?

17:44.434 --> 17:45.965
Yeah.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.868
Of course.

17:50.267 --> 17:51.666
I...

17:51.701 --> 17:53.200
am so horny.

17:56.167 --> 17:59.133
Listen, Nicole,
me and your mom are together.

17:59.168 --> 18:00.701
I-I can't
fool around with you.

18:00.736 --> 18:01.899
It's not right.

18:01.934 --> 18:03.667
Then don't fool around with me.

18:03.702 --> 18:05.400
I'll just fool around with you.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.067
No...

18:08.102 --> 18:09.032
No.

18:09.067 --> 18:10.098
It-i-i-i-it...

18:10.133 --> 18:11.801
This is a really bad,
wrong idea.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.734
Nicole, you shouldn't-- Oh!

18:14.769 --> 18:16.667
Your mom's right next door.

18:16.702 --> 18:19.267
What if s-s-she-- Oh.

18:19.302 --> 18:20.351
Oh.

18:20.386 --> 18:21.400
Oh.

18:22.868 --> 18:23.950
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:23.985 --> 18:24.998
Colleen here?

18:25.033 --> 18:26.165
Yeah,
she's upstairs.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.733
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

18:27.768 --> 18:29.701
Okay, I don't know
what happened,

18:29.736 --> 18:31.634
but in her words,
we both suck now.

18:31.669 --> 18:32.599
Really?

18:32.634 --> 18:34.334
Mm. So what
did happen?

18:34.369 --> 18:35.365
You know what?

18:35.400 --> 18:38.601
On second thought,
I don't want to know.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.501
Want to talk about this?

18:45.767 --> 18:47.567
What are you doing
going through my trash?

18:47.602 --> 18:49.518
I was throwing something away
and I saw it.

18:49.553 --> 18:51.399
You have no right
to go through my trash!

18:51.440 --> 18:53.487
Let me tell you something, okay?
I asked Colleen about it.

18:53.519 --> 18:54.866
She doesn't know anything
about it.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.033
It's mine, all right?
I am pregnant. Are you happy?

18:57.068 --> 18:58.299
You know what?

18:58.334 --> 19:00.133
Just get out, Tommy.
Just get out!

19:00.168 --> 19:01.701
- Get out!
- Hey, hey, hey!

19:12.067 --> 19:15.100
I screwed up with
my birth control, all right?

19:16.901 --> 19:18.701
Well, is it mine?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.133
And that's all
that you're worried about, huh?

19:22.168 --> 19:23.599
No, it's not all--

19:23.634 --> 19:25.434
It's 50-50.
You like those odds?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.534
Yeah. Those odds are fine.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.967
What--?

19:50.002 --> 19:51.534
What--?

19:52.801 --> 19:54.799
Jeannie,

19:54.834 --> 19:56.567
there was a cigar box
in the cabinet.

19:56.602 --> 19:57.767
What did you
do with it?

19:57.802 --> 19:58.965
I never touched it.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.400
It was in there
two days ago.

20:00.435 --> 20:02.217
That's your cabinet.

20:02.252 --> 20:04.000
You cleaned it out!

20:04.035 --> 20:05.534
No, I didn't.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.132
You found
the money, hmm?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.467
You took it and you spent it.
Is that what happened?

20:12.502 --> 20:13.518
What money?

20:13.553 --> 20:14.499
Where is it?

20:14.534 --> 20:17.167
Honey, I never
went in your cabinet.

20:17.202 --> 20:18.499
That's my money!

20:18.534 --> 20:21.000
I never told you about it
because, quite honestly,

20:21.035 --> 20:22.132
it's none of your business!

20:22.167 --> 20:24.132
Now, I need that money.
Where the hell is it?

20:24.167 --> 20:26.567
Seriously, Jerry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:29.234 --> 20:31.167
- Where's the goddamn money?
- Why are you doing this?

20:31.202 --> 20:32.399
Come here! Come here!

20:32.434 --> 20:33.599
I want to show you
something!

20:33.652 --> 20:35.517
- You're hurting me!
- Come in here! Come here.

20:35.577 --> 20:37.893
Just come here,
come here and tell me,

20:37.936 --> 20:39.934
did you clean out
this cabinet?

20:39.969 --> 20:41.032
No!

20:41.067 --> 20:43.499
Jeannie, you've known me
for 32 years.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.534
Have I ever done anything
this organized, huh?

20:51.033 --> 20:52.033
I guess...

20:53.200 --> 20:54.100
maybe...

20:55.033 --> 20:58.200
I guess I did tidy up in there.

20:58.235 --> 21:01.367
Maybe I threw
some things out.

21:01.402 --> 21:04.998
You threw out
my money.

21:05.033 --> 21:08.133
Jeannie,
you threw my money out.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.234
Jesus!

21:19.200 --> 21:20.199
Yeah?

21:20.234 --> 21:21.466
Hey, cowboy.

21:21.501 --> 21:23.734
Want to come over
and get a little?

21:29.367 --> 21:30.534
Tommy?

21:30.569 --> 21:31.666
Uh...

21:31.701 --> 21:32.701
Look, it's, um...

21:32.736 --> 21:33.666
Come on.

21:33.701 --> 21:34.998
Damian just left for work.

21:35.033 --> 21:38.033
We could use every room
in the house.

21:38.068 --> 21:39.933
I-I just--
I can't right now.

21:39.968 --> 21:41.968
What do you mean? Since when--

21:45.767 --> 21:47.567
Little shit.

22:05.167 --> 22:06.732
Morning, chief.

22:06.767 --> 22:08.100
Hey,
good morning, Kenny.

22:08.135 --> 22:09.734
Hey, uh, Kenny.

22:09.769 --> 22:11.334
You got a minute?

22:11.369 --> 22:12.499
Yeah.

22:12.534 --> 22:14.332
I'm in a bind.

22:14.367 --> 22:17.567
Oh, don't tell me.
The mortal lock the other night.

22:17.602 --> 22:19.098
Yeah.

22:19.133 --> 22:20.599
My bookies cut me off here.

22:20.634 --> 22:22.067
They want to get paid
by Friday.

22:22.102 --> 22:23.032
How much?

22:23.067 --> 22:24.934
- Five large.
- Ah, jeez.

22:24.969 --> 22:25.965
I'm stuck, Kenny.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.100
Look, if I could help you,
I would, chief.

22:29.135 --> 22:31.132
Hey, these goons,

22:31.167 --> 22:32.834
they play hardball,
you know?

22:32.869 --> 22:34.232
They threatened me.

22:34.267 --> 22:36.532
Anything? I mean,
a couple hundred bucks?

22:36.567 --> 22:39.167
I'm busted till payday.
I mean, can't you ask around?

22:39.202 --> 22:41.767
Maybe one of the other guys
got something lying around?

22:41.802 --> 22:44.365
I can't ask the guys,
Kenny.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.150
You got something
you could hock?

22:47.185 --> 22:49.901
Something worth
that kind of cabbage?

22:49.936 --> 22:52.051
I got my old man's watch.

22:52.086 --> 22:53.960
It was his old man's.

22:53.995 --> 22:55.799
I mean, if I did it,

22:55.834 --> 22:58.767
I'd feel like I was pissing
on the family history.

22:58.802 --> 23:01.868
I don't know what
to tell you, chief.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.732
Forget it.

23:04.767 --> 23:06.065
Don't worry about it.

23:06.100 --> 23:09.100
Don't even mention
I said anything.

23:13.801 --> 23:15.834
You're a powerful man
there, Garrity.

23:17.334 --> 23:18.998
Hey, there's my hero.

23:19.033 --> 23:20.934
What's new
in mother-daughter land?

23:20.969 --> 23:21.998
Oh, guys,

23:22.033 --> 23:24.766
it's totally screwed up.

23:24.801 --> 23:26.934
I had sex
with the daughter.

23:26.969 --> 23:28.068
What? Get out.

23:28.103 --> 23:29.302
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

23:29.337 --> 23:30.466
Well, oral sex.

23:30.501 --> 23:32.000
Oh, well, contrary
to popular opinion,

23:32.035 --> 23:33.167
that does count as sex.

23:33.202 --> 23:34.300
Congratulations, stud.

23:34.335 --> 23:35.532
Thanks.

23:35.567 --> 23:37.199
I feel kind of guilty,
you know?

23:37.234 --> 23:39.400
I mean, I've cheated on Paula
a couple of times,

23:39.435 --> 23:40.566
but this
is different.

23:40.601 --> 23:42.834
Who was better?
The mom or the daughter?

23:42.869 --> 23:45.332
Well, Paula was better
technically,

23:45.367 --> 23:48.767
but the daughter, Nicole,
she was really into it.

23:48.802 --> 23:52.167
I think I have to leave the room
for a few minutes.

23:52.202 --> 23:53.651
Yeah, you know,
that's the difference

23:53.686 --> 23:55.065
between older
and younger chicks--

23:55.100 --> 23:56.700
the older ones,
they know what they're doing,

23:56.751 --> 23:58.450
they've been through it a lot,
it's mechanical.

23:58.495 --> 23:59.999
The younger ones
are not as good,

24:00.032 --> 24:01.821
but they still have
that fellatio enthusiasm.

24:01.866 --> 24:03.641
Be nice to get a little of both.

24:03.702 --> 24:04.933
Wow, yeah.

24:04.968 --> 24:06.300
Yeah, well, you can.

24:06.335 --> 24:07.365
Really?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.866
Yeah. Young moms.
26 years old.

24:08.901 --> 24:10.834
That's the age
you get the perfect blend.

24:10.869 --> 24:11.799
Ooh. 26, huh?

24:11.834 --> 24:13.400
Yeah, it's the sweet spot.

24:18.734 --> 24:19.699
Hello?

24:19.734 --> 24:23.267
Is this the great author
speaking?

24:23.302 --> 24:24.667
Yeah.

24:24.702 --> 24:25.998
I read

24:26.033 --> 24:27.801
some of the poems
that you sent me.

24:27.836 --> 24:29.666
You're so talented.

24:29.701 --> 24:31.067
Who is that? Is that Glenda?

24:31.102 --> 24:32.434
I'm waitin' on a call, honey.

24:32.469 --> 24:33.918
No, it's, uh, P.B.A.

24:33.953 --> 24:35.332
They want a donation.

24:35.367 --> 24:38.067
Well, hang up the phone, then.
I'm waitin' on a call here.

24:38.102 --> 24:40.200
Hang up already,
Kenny!

24:40.235 --> 24:42.251
Sorry about that.

24:42.286 --> 24:44.232
I was thinking, um,

24:44.267 --> 24:45.567
maybe we could
get together.

24:45.602 --> 24:47.168
Really?

24:47.203 --> 24:48.699
Um...

24:48.734 --> 24:49.767
Yeah, I don't know.

24:49.802 --> 24:51.601
Are you busy?

24:51.636 --> 24:53.365
Uh... no, look,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.500
Sondra, um,
two things:

24:55.535 --> 24:57.601
number one is
I'm married,

24:57.636 --> 24:58.818
okay?

24:58.853 --> 24:59.965
Um...

25:00.000 --> 25:01.165
number two is,

25:01.200 --> 25:03.300
there's this kind of
unofficial thing about,

25:03.335 --> 25:05.234
you know, seeing widows.

25:05.269 --> 25:06.399
I might be a widow,

25:06.434 --> 25:07.834
but, as you know,
I hated Billy.

25:07.869 --> 25:09.484
Right.

25:09.519 --> 25:11.065
So...

25:11.100 --> 25:12.933
are we gonna
get together or not?

25:12.968 --> 25:14.901
Kenny, would you
get off the phone already?

25:14.936 --> 25:16.300
What, am I talkin'
to a moron?

25:16.335 --> 25:18.234
Please!

25:20.834 --> 25:22.699
Hey.

25:22.734 --> 25:24.566
I'm going out...

25:24.601 --> 25:26.866
...asshole.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.300
You know what? That's a good
name for you, isn't it?

25:29.335 --> 25:31.267
You like that, right?

25:31.302 --> 25:33.165
Okay, "Asshole" it is.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.334
Let me tell you something else,
you eat one more hockey jersey,

25:36.369 --> 25:38.098
and you're gonna have
two assholes, Asshole,

25:38.133 --> 25:40.934
the one God gave you and the new
one I'm gonna rip for you.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.217
Ahem.

25:44.252 --> 25:45.276
Yeah?

25:45.311 --> 25:46.265
Hey, son.

25:46.300 --> 25:47.417
Hey, Dad.
What's going on?

25:47.462 --> 25:48.712
Well, I thought
you might like

25:48.772 --> 25:50.231
to know I'm back home
with your mother.

25:50.269 --> 25:51.734
Really?

25:51.769 --> 25:53.165
It's okay?

25:53.200 --> 25:54.833
Well, it's been
72 hours,

25:54.868 --> 25:56.467
and she hasn't said
word one to me.

25:56.502 --> 25:59.165
It's goddamn heaven.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.750
I am a little worried
about Teddy, though.

26:01.785 --> 26:04.209
I may have killed him
by overdosing him,

26:04.244 --> 26:06.599
so if you could just
swing by there--

26:06.634 --> 26:08.883
It's been three days, Dad.
If he's dead, he's dead.

26:08.918 --> 26:11.133
Bad news travels fast.
I think we would've heard.

26:11.168 --> 26:12.132
Not much we can do.

26:12.167 --> 26:14.300
So what made you
decide to go back home?

26:14.335 --> 26:16.401
Well,
I did the math,

26:16.436 --> 26:18.652
and the way
I figured it,

26:18.687 --> 26:20.744
i-i-i-if I stayed with Teddy,

26:20.779 --> 26:22.766
with the partying and whoring,

26:22.801 --> 26:25.532
I could be dead
inside of two years,

26:25.567 --> 26:29.234
but if I stay with your mother,
I could last another 10.

26:29.269 --> 26:31.668
Ultimately, it has to do
with the Red Sox.

26:31.703 --> 26:34.067
Now, I can't see them
winning the World Series

26:34.102 --> 26:36.067
in the next two years,

26:36.102 --> 26:38.033
but in the next 10?

26:38.068 --> 26:39.599
Ah-hah.

26:39.634 --> 26:41.167
And there you have it.

26:41.202 --> 26:42.933
Go figure.

26:42.968 --> 26:45.000
See you soon. Bye.

27:01.534 --> 27:02.901
Oh. Sorry.
Did I wake you?

27:04.133 --> 27:05.901
I've been waiting for you.

27:05.936 --> 27:06.934
Come sit.

27:08.601 --> 27:09.767
Come here.

27:09.802 --> 27:10.934
Look...

27:12.367 --> 27:15.000
Nicole, we can't
get into this again.

27:15.035 --> 27:16.332
It's not right.

27:16.367 --> 27:17.868
You thought
it was right last night.

27:17.903 --> 27:20.367
No, I-I made a mistake.

27:20.402 --> 27:21.767
A mistake?

27:21.802 --> 27:22.801
Yeah.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.234
Yeah, you're right.

27:27.269 --> 27:28.933
Good.

27:28.968 --> 27:31.000
Yeah, it's a mistake
to deceive people.

27:31.035 --> 27:33.267
Yeah, that's right.

27:33.302 --> 27:34.599
Exactly.

27:34.634 --> 27:37.200
That's why I think
we should tell my mom.

27:37.235 --> 27:38.866
What?

27:38.901 --> 27:40.784
Just to get it out there
in the open,

27:40.819 --> 27:42.632
so there's no tension
between us.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.467
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Let's not do that.

27:44.502 --> 27:46.367
I'll talk to her.

27:46.402 --> 27:48.965
No, please.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.133
Then get
on your knees.

27:52.168 --> 27:53.732
What?

27:53.767 --> 27:55.666
I did something
for you last night.

27:55.701 --> 28:00.167
Now it's your turn
to do something for me.

28:00.202 --> 28:02.801
Or I could just
tell my mom.

28:02.836 --> 28:05.400
No, no, no.
Okay, okay, okay.

28:16.467 --> 28:19.265
That's a good boy.

28:19.300 --> 28:22.084
Like, this line
right here--

28:22.119 --> 28:24.833
"Life is like
a carousel

28:24.868 --> 28:27.584
with the brass ring
just out of reach."

28:27.619 --> 28:30.300
Yeah, that's one
of my favorite lines.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.866
It's like you went
into my soul

28:32.901 --> 28:35.767
and you just knew
exactly how I felt.

28:44.267 --> 28:45.467
Sondra--

28:45.502 --> 28:46.632
I'm sorry.

28:46.667 --> 28:49.167
No, look. I mean, you're...

28:49.202 --> 28:50.766
an attractive woman.

28:50.801 --> 28:52.332
It's just that I'm married.

28:52.367 --> 28:55.234
I mean, nothing
can come of it.

28:56.567 --> 28:59.868
You don't have to go.

28:59.903 --> 29:01.868
I do, though.

29:03.434 --> 29:05.300
I really do.

29:19.667 --> 29:20.667
Hey.

29:20.702 --> 29:21.632
Hi.

29:21.667 --> 29:24.067
I, uh, I've been thinking...

29:24.102 --> 29:24.934
and, uh...

29:26.767 --> 29:28.234
I think we should have the kid.

29:30.133 --> 29:31.265
Yeah, yeah.

29:31.300 --> 29:32.834
I mean, I think--
I think--

29:32.869 --> 29:34.265
I don't know.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.701
This might just be...

29:37.567 --> 29:39.734
some kind of a sign,
you know?

29:39.769 --> 29:41.833
A sign?

29:41.868 --> 29:43.866
Yeah, I think that maybe

29:43.901 --> 29:46.367
we should raise the kid
together,

29:46.402 --> 29:47.367
that we should...

29:48.434 --> 29:49.666
be back together.

29:49.701 --> 29:52.200
I mean, instead of
thinking of it as a negative,

29:52.235 --> 29:54.566
I'm thinking...

29:54.601 --> 29:55.534
maybe it's a positive.

29:58.133 --> 30:00.699
I don't know.

30:00.734 --> 30:03.901
I got to put some more thought
into this.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.332
All right.

30:07.367 --> 30:10.134
Uh, anyways, I'm here.

30:10.169 --> 30:13.018
Whatever you want to do.

30:13.053 --> 30:15.833
Roger ain't,
but I am.

30:15.868 --> 30:19.100
So, you know,
if you want to talk,

30:19.135 --> 30:20.901
just let me know.

30:20.936 --> 30:22.133
Okay?

30:23.501 --> 30:24.599
Okay.

30:24.634 --> 30:26.667
Good night.

30:39.100 --> 30:42.399
Hey, got a call from a Larry
O'Hearn over at 68 Ladder.

30:42.434 --> 30:46.868
Seems they got, in his words,
"a nine-foot-tall Swedish chick"

30:46.903 --> 30:47.998
assigned to their house.

30:48.033 --> 30:49.634
You don't suppose
there are two of them?

30:49.669 --> 30:50.818
You know what that means?

30:50.853 --> 30:51.933
We're getting the dyke.

30:51.968 --> 30:54.267
We're getting
the queen of dykes.

30:54.302 --> 30:55.532
Or should I say,
the king?

30:55.567 --> 30:57.684
It doesn't matter.
I talked to all the guys.

30:57.719 --> 30:59.801
As soon as she shows up,
she's frozen out.

30:59.836 --> 31:00.965
Talkin' about completely.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.734
Hey, chief,
somebody called for you.

31:02.769 --> 31:03.799
Yeah? Who was it?

31:03.834 --> 31:05.032
He didn't leave a name.

31:05.067 --> 31:07.000
He just said to remind you
that tomorrow's Friday.

31:07.035 --> 31:08.534
Duh.

31:14.334 --> 31:16.334
She forced you to give her head?

31:16.369 --> 31:17.399
Yeah.

31:17.434 --> 31:18.868
It's gotten
way out of hand, Franco.

31:18.903 --> 31:20.032
I don't know what to do.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.901
Oh, I know exactly
what you should do.

31:21.936 --> 31:23.132
You do?

31:23.167 --> 31:25.400
Yeah. Give me your keys
and let me be you tonight.

31:29.334 --> 31:30.667
Engine.

31:30.702 --> 31:32.000
Ladder.

31:32.701 --> 31:33.834
Battalion.

31:43.467 --> 31:45.117
It's a gas leak, all right.

31:45.152 --> 31:46.732
Take a walk upstairs, boys.

31:46.767 --> 31:49.601
Tommy, check the caller.
He called from 3-C.

31:49.636 --> 31:51.268
Franco, check down in there.

31:51.303 --> 31:52.901
Knock on some doors, all right?

31:52.936 --> 31:55.334
And don't light up.

31:56.868 --> 31:58.117
Hello?

31:58.152 --> 31:59.332
In here.

31:59.367 --> 32:01.617
Ma'am, look,
we have a report of a gas leak.

32:01.652 --> 32:03.868
I have to ask you
to go down to the lobby.

32:03.903 --> 32:05.367
I can't leave my father.

32:05.402 --> 32:06.332
Well, where is he?

32:06.367 --> 32:08.467
Here!
Help me get this down.

32:08.502 --> 32:09.833
Oh, jeez.

32:09.868 --> 32:11.868
Yeah, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

32:11.903 --> 32:13.165
Hey, uh, chief?

32:13.200 --> 32:15.317
They found the leak's source.
It's in the basement.

32:15.352 --> 32:17.434
Franco. Take this lady down
into the lobby, all right?

32:17.469 --> 32:18.634
I'm gonna open up
some windows

32:18.669 --> 32:19.634
and ventilate
this place.

32:19.669 --> 32:20.634
All right.

32:21.634 --> 32:23.065
Don't hurt
my father!

32:23.100 --> 32:25.100
I'm being careful,
ma'am. You got the door?

32:25.135 --> 32:26.300
I got it.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.466
Hey. What's up?
Where's Garrity?

33:20.501 --> 33:22.100
He was in the bunkroom
two seconds ago.

33:22.135 --> 33:23.632
I told him
to get out here.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.067
He probably got lost
on the way.

33:25.102 --> 33:26.632
- Shit.
- Hey.

33:26.667 --> 33:27.899
Hey, man, get out here.

33:27.934 --> 33:29.534
You know that chick?
She shows up tomorrow.

33:29.569 --> 33:30.934
Forget
about that, okay?

33:30.969 --> 33:31.933
I found the guy

33:31.968 --> 33:33.367
who started the fire
that killed Billy.

33:33.402 --> 33:34.532
- No shit?
- I swear to God.

33:34.567 --> 33:35.667
- You serious?
- Dead serious.

33:35.702 --> 33:36.767
Well, let's go
kick his ass.

33:36.802 --> 33:38.268
Yeah.
You got your van?

33:38.303 --> 33:39.734
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

33:45.167 --> 33:47.232
Hey, this room's taken

33:47.267 --> 33:48.767
unless you want
to share your stash.

33:48.802 --> 33:49.885
Jesus!

33:49.920 --> 33:50.933
Goddamn.

33:50.968 --> 33:52.432
Whoa. Hey, guys, look.

33:52.467 --> 33:55.834
I don't want any trouble,
so if you want the room, I'll--

33:55.869 --> 33:57.367
Sit down.

33:59.133 --> 34:01.234
You start that warehouse fire
last week, asshole?

34:01.269 --> 34:02.965
No, man. I was lucky--

34:03.000 --> 34:05.501
We lost a brother
in there, asshole.

34:05.536 --> 34:06.918
Man, I didn't
do shit!

34:06.953 --> 34:08.264
But you were there, right?

34:08.300 --> 34:10.934
Yeah, I was there,
but it was the girls, man. Aw!

34:10.969 --> 34:12.501
You made that little girl
blow you,

34:12.536 --> 34:14.033
then she set your shirt
on fire, right?

34:14.068 --> 34:15.264
Yeah, she tried to fry me,

34:15.300 --> 34:17.100
so why don't you go blame
that little bitch?

34:17.135 --> 34:18.599
Shut your mouth!

34:18.634 --> 34:20.434
Guys, give me a couple minutes
alone with him.

34:20.469 --> 34:21.801
Tommy,
what are you gonna do?

34:21.835 --> 34:22.766
Just gonna talk to him.

34:22.801 --> 34:25.167
You better start
prayin', bitch.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.917
What are you doin'?

34:31.952 --> 34:34.000
Close that door.

34:36.266 --> 34:38.501
Hey, asshole.

34:42.601 --> 34:44.264
What are you doin'?

34:44.300 --> 34:45.801
What's it look like I'm doin'?

34:45.835 --> 34:47.051
You're crazy.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.232
That's right.

34:48.266 --> 34:50.098
I'm crazy. Good and crazy.

34:50.132 --> 34:52.934
You're gonna feel
what Billy felt.

34:52.969 --> 34:54.167
Okay, asshole?

34:57.167 --> 34:58.567
See you in hell.

34:58.602 --> 35:01.000
Hey. Hey!

35:01.035 --> 35:02.299
Hey!

35:02.334 --> 35:03.767
Tommy, what are you doin'?

35:03.802 --> 35:05.034
Teachin' him a lesson.

35:05.069 --> 35:06.267
Come on.
This is crazy.

35:06.302 --> 35:07.933
No, man,

35:07.968 --> 35:09.065
I'm telling you
something, man.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.100
I saw Billy.
He was right in front of me.

35:11.135 --> 35:12.201
Now he's gone,

35:12.236 --> 35:13.232
and this scumbag

35:13.267 --> 35:14.868
is back in another crack house,
getting high?

35:14.903 --> 35:16.151
No, it's not right.

35:16.186 --> 35:17.365
I'm sorry!

35:17.400 --> 35:19.098
This is justice, okay?

35:19.133 --> 35:20.534
God's not gonna
take care of it?

35:20.569 --> 35:21.699
I will.

35:21.734 --> 35:24.566
Come on, man!

35:24.601 --> 35:25.901
Come on! I didn't mean it!

35:25.936 --> 35:27.732
I'm sorry!

35:27.767 --> 35:29.601
Yeah, how's
it feel, scumbag, huh?

35:29.636 --> 35:31.200
Tommy, that's enough.

35:31.235 --> 35:32.833
I'll be back.

35:32.868 --> 35:34.133
Tommy, let go of the door.

35:34.168 --> 35:35.833
Get off of me, man!

35:35.868 --> 35:38.167
Hot enough for you, huh?

35:38.202 --> 35:40.100
Asshole!

35:41.200 --> 35:42.767
Tommy, let him out.

35:42.802 --> 35:44.299
Shut up, Franco.

35:44.334 --> 35:48.033
It was just candles!
It was just candles!

35:48.068 --> 35:49.998
I was drunk and high!

35:50.033 --> 35:51.634
I was just drunk and high.

35:51.669 --> 35:52.701
It was just candles!

35:58.534 --> 35:59.567
Oh, goddamn it.

35:59.602 --> 36:00.434
Tommy...

36:03.767 --> 36:04.998
Shit.

36:05.033 --> 36:07.434
Hey, coming through, guys.

36:07.469 --> 36:10.000
You all right?

36:18.901 --> 36:21.834
Hey, guys, the fire's out.

38:09.634 --> 38:12.667
This might have been
a mistake.

38:14.601 --> 38:16.400
Excuse me, ma'am?

38:16.435 --> 38:17.566
- Yes?
- Hi.

38:17.601 --> 38:19.267
I was here yesterday.
I'm a fireman.

38:19.302 --> 38:20.466
Oh, yes.

38:20.501 --> 38:22.868
You helped me
with my father's portrait.

38:22.903 --> 38:23.833
Thank you.

38:23.868 --> 38:24.833
Well, you're welcome.

38:24.868 --> 38:26.265
Listen, in all the confusion,

38:26.300 --> 38:30.033
we knocked a couple of things
over, and, uh...

38:30.068 --> 38:32.217
I found this.

38:32.252 --> 38:34.332
Oh, bless you.

38:34.367 --> 38:37.800
I thought
I'd never see it again.

38:37.835 --> 38:41.234
Uh, and, uh,
also, this cash.

38:41.269 --> 38:42.701
Oh, no.
You keep it.

38:42.736 --> 38:44.335
I don't want the money.

38:44.370 --> 38:45.934
I just wanted my ring back.

38:45.969 --> 38:48.267
You're an angel.

38:48.302 --> 38:50.368
Ah, here.

38:50.403 --> 38:52.434
I'm not.

38:54.067 --> 38:55.399
I'm not.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.300
- Thank you.
- All right.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.666
Jesus, kid, what's the deal?

39:02.701 --> 39:04.100
How long you gonna be
stayin' here?

39:04.135 --> 39:05.300
Until I find
a new place.

39:05.335 --> 39:06.265
If you guys hear

39:06.300 --> 39:07.601
of any real cheap
studio apartments,

39:07.636 --> 39:08.566
let me know.

39:08.601 --> 39:10.098
Trouble in paradise,
junior?

39:10.133 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, he got caught bangin'
his girlfriend's daughter.

39:12.035 --> 39:13.132
What?

39:13.167 --> 39:15.517
You know, I can't
believe this kid.

39:15.552 --> 39:17.833
He gets asked
to do three-ways,

39:17.868 --> 39:21.232
he's got a mother-daughter
combo platter goin' on.

39:21.267 --> 39:23.667
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, but when I die,

39:23.702 --> 39:25.933
I'd like to come back
as your penis.

39:25.968 --> 39:28.167
First cool day in a week.
You know what that means?

39:28.202 --> 39:29.532
That means
the Mets are gonna win.

39:29.567 --> 39:31.567
- I'm gonna bet a dime on 'em tonight.
- A dime?

39:31.602 --> 39:32.901
That's a lot of cake.

39:32.936 --> 39:33.998
Feelin' lucky.

39:34.033 --> 39:35.500
What are you doin'
betting again?

39:35.535 --> 39:36.968
I thought you had
cash problems.

39:37.003 --> 39:37.968
I took care of it.

39:38.003 --> 39:38.933
How?

39:38.968 --> 39:40.466
The old man's watch.

39:40.501 --> 39:43.901
It didn't keep good time anyway.

39:43.936 --> 39:45.899
Oh, Lou, I almost forgot.

39:45.934 --> 39:49.467
Some chick named Sondra called?

39:49.502 --> 39:51.065
I don't know
any Sondra.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.601
Wasn't that Billy's wife's name?

39:52.636 --> 39:53.899
It was his ex-wife.

39:53.934 --> 39:55.801
Billy, we hardly knew ya.

39:55.836 --> 39:57.701
- Yeah, Billy.
- Billy.

39:57.736 --> 39:59.234
Billy.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.601
Hey, guys.
Is Chief Reilly here?

40:05.300 --> 40:07.133
Yeah. Can I help you?

40:07.168 --> 40:08.466
I'm Laura Miles.

40:08.501 --> 40:11.367
I've been transferred
to your house.

40:15.033 --> 40:16.767
Ice.

40:18.901 --> 40:21.184
Oh, okay. Thanks.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.432
Oh. Very adult.

40:23.467 --> 40:26.334
Really appreciate that.

40:31.734 --> 40:33.634
Well, well, well,
let the games begin.

40:33.669 --> 40:34.666
You know what?

40:34.701 --> 40:36.299
Two weeks,
she's gone.

40:36.334 --> 40:38.701
Look, I got a better idea.
I've been thinking about it.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.399
You guys still give her
the ice, okay?

40:40.434 --> 40:42.651
But I'm gonna be nice to her
for, like, a month,

40:42.686 --> 40:44.610
and lull her into
a false sense of security,

40:44.645 --> 40:46.534
and then when
she least suspects it, bam,

40:46.569 --> 40:47.934
I come down on her, shatter her.

40:47.969 --> 40:49.232
Jesus, Tommy.

40:49.267 --> 40:50.701
It's a good idea.

40:50.736 --> 40:51.699
Come on.

40:51.734 --> 40:54.132
Yeah, yeah,
that is a good idea.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.934
But I should be the one
who's nice to her...

40:55.969 --> 40:57.666
- What?
- ...because she was checkin' me out.

40:57.701 --> 41:00.100
She was lookin' at me first.
I should be the nice guy.

41:00.135 --> 41:01.300
Look, I thought
of it first.

41:01.335 --> 41:02.299
I got shotgun.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.432
- Hey, look--
- My idea.

41:03.467 --> 41:05.701
What are you waitin' for,
gloom-boy?

41:05.736 --> 41:07.334
Might as well.

41:07.369 --> 41:09.200
Ay-ay-ay.

41:13.167 --> 41:14.534
Good news.

41:15.834 --> 41:16.799
What?

41:16.834 --> 41:18.950
The test was wrong.

41:18.985 --> 41:21.067
I got my period.

41:23.868 --> 41:26.332
No baby.

41:26.367 --> 41:28.265
That was never gonna
make things right.

41:28.300 --> 41:30.934
After everything
that has happened between us,

41:30.969 --> 41:32.701
to somehow think
that a new baby would--

41:32.736 --> 41:34.067
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:34.102 --> 41:36.100
Pipe dream. I got you.

41:36.135 --> 41:38.300
I'm sorry.

42:00.434 --> 42:02.100
Hey, foxy.

42:02.135 --> 42:03.132
Hey.

42:03.167 --> 42:04.732
Damian home?

42:04.767 --> 42:07.000
No, he's sleeping over
at a friend's.

42:07.035 --> 42:08.434
Why?

42:08.469 --> 42:09.651
Tommy?

42:09.686 --> 42:10.799
All right,

42:10.834 --> 42:12.067
I'm coming over
in five minutes.

42:12.102 --> 42:13.065
Really?

42:13.100 --> 42:14.133
You like that?

42:14.168 --> 42:15.132
Yeah.

42:15.167 --> 42:17.701
But I have very specific
conditions, okay?

42:17.736 --> 42:18.866
Like?

42:18.901 --> 42:21.000
Like six-inch stiletto heels...

42:22.400 --> 42:25.267
and that black leather skirt
I saw you wear once.

42:25.302 --> 42:26.799
Yeah?

42:26.834 --> 42:28.032
No panties.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.232
Oh, my God.

42:29.267 --> 42:31.200
Black lace bra...

42:32.267 --> 42:33.466
tall whiskey,

42:33.501 --> 42:35.200
and a very cold beer.

42:35.235 --> 42:36.299
All right.

42:36.334 --> 42:38.065
And when I get there,

42:38.100 --> 42:40.767
you do whatever
I tell you to do.

42:40.802 --> 42:42.134
All right.

42:42.169 --> 42:43.467
I'm all yours.

42:46.234 --> 42:48.500
Sheil?

42:48.535 --> 42:50.767
Hey.

43:03.636 --> 43:04.566
Good girl.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.632
Thank you.

43:20.669 --> 43:21.599
Hello.

43:28.536 --> 43:30.599
So, ahem.

43:30.634 --> 43:33.801
What do you want
me to do first?

43:33.836 --> 43:35.168
First?

43:35.203 --> 43:36.466
Mm-hmm.

43:36.501 --> 43:38.567
I want you to dance.

43:38.602 --> 43:40.632
Okay.
