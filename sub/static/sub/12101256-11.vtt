If we have to hide baby Kristoff
he will need a new name.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.281
What about Jack?

00:14.314 --> 00:16.450
Jack Van Helsing.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.987
What we need is to split up.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.089
I hate to say it, but splitting
the two of you up

00:22.122 --> 00:23.090
is the only way to make sure

00:23.123 --> 00:25.959
that at least one of you
makes it to the Oracle.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.061
How're we gonna find each
other once we're there?

00:28.095 --> 00:30.130
There's a place
called Meridian Park,

00:30.163 --> 00:32.099
it has a sundial in it.

Axel: You're just gonna stroll
up to the White House,

00:40.541 --> 00:42.042

by yourself?

00:42.075 --> 00:43.710
Vanessa: I'll need a disguise.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.846
Someone the Dark One
will never suspect.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.681
Axel: I have the perfect
candidate.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.625
Dark One: Fear is eternal.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.662
Ambition is immortal.

01:01.695 --> 01:05.165
Suspicion is armour.

01:05.198 --> 01:11.638
Vengeance is survival,
and I will survive.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.241

01:14.274 --> 01:18.645
My name is Dracula.

for a reason,

01:26.119 --> 01:28.088
that much is certain.

01:28.121 --> 01:32.326
Yes, I suppose she did.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.660
Suppose?

01:33.694 --> 01:36.630
Well, considering any who
ignored her invitation

01:36.663 --> 01:39.132
were hunted down
and beheaded...

01:39.166 --> 01:44.237
Yes, I wager she has something
particular in mind.

01:44.271 --> 01:48.241
Every great ruler needs
a council beside her,

01:48.275 --> 01:52.446
to advise, to share in
the burdens.

01:52.479 --> 01:55.115

02:30.350 --> 02:33.153
I have lingered in the depths
of existence.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.956
Enough of your evasion.

02:35.989 --> 02:40.093
If the rumours are true
and the Dark One is
weakened, vulnerable,

02:40.127 --> 02:43.196
there may well be a shift
in the balance of power.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.365
And if you think an outsider
can take a position

02:45.399 --> 02:46.633
that is rightfully mine‐

02:46.667 --> 02:48.735
Rightfully yours?

listening to rumours.

You killed the others.

her so you can bite her.

27:38.123 --> 27:42.027
You haven't tried yourself?

27:42.060 --> 27:46.932
I was bit by the elder Abadon

27:46.965 --> 27:49.868
I don't think I have the power.

27:49.902 --> 27:53.005
But you and Violet?

27:53.038 --> 27:56.642
You're the next generation
of Hansen's weapon.

27:56.675 --> 28:01.647
He designed you to do this.

28:02.714 --> 28:06.151

Part of her darkness.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.927
I could feel her.

So that's why she's not
at full strength.

spat it back out.

felt possessed by its power.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.340
She hardly survived.

28:32.744 --> 28:35.180
You and Violet
are something else.

28:35.214 --> 28:39.985
You know that, right?

28:42.387 --> 28:44.423
Part of it, maybe.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.793
But the rest is just
your own courage.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.929
Your own determination.

28:50.963 --> 28:54.166
I'm proud of you.

28:59.004 --> 29:02.174
We should part ways for now.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.878
Hey... if all this doesn't
work out...

29:06.912 --> 29:08.380
It will.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.415
Believe it.

29:10.449 --> 29:13.118
I'll see you soon.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.372
Bathory: Good morning.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.242
You were out late.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.845
Some of us have a life.

29:39.878 --> 29:40.979
Mmm.

29:41.013 --> 29:45.851
I have beaten better than you
in my extensive life.

29:46.918 --> 29:50.956
I am the one and only bride
of the Dark One

29:50.989 --> 29:54.860
and I am going to stay that way.

30:07.806 --> 30:08.974
Doubt that.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.009
[laughs]

30:12.844 --> 30:14.279
You are surprisingly strong

30:14.313 --> 30:18.984
for some low‐level
white trash vampire.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.285
Thanks?

30:20.319 --> 30:25.157
But have you ever experienced
real pain, Nina?

30:25.190 --> 30:27.859
You're just gonna die slowly.

30:27.893 --> 30:31.029
No need to rush matters.

30:31.063 --> 30:36.234
We can just keep it like this,
let's say, a decade or two?

30:36.268 --> 30:38.303
With little spikes...

30:38.337 --> 30:40.072
[winces]

30:40.105 --> 30:42.240
Then again it would be so
pleasing to see your feeble

30:42.274 --> 30:46.812
little brains leak out through
that ugly nose of yours.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.250
[laughs]

30:53.852 --> 30:55.420
You first.

30:56.555 --> 30:57.756
[groans]

31:00.826 --> 31:02.561
Oh.

31:04.830 --> 31:08.300
Let's see how powerful
you really are.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.917
Children, please.

31:25.951 --> 31:28.253
No need to fight over me.

31:28.286 --> 31:29.354
As you wish.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.224
I caught her sneaking back in.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.126
I was out tracking
the Van Helsing.

31:34.159 --> 31:37.129
I know where she is,
and she has the amulet.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.864
Lies.

31:38.897 --> 31:43.101
So where is this slippery Jack?

31:43.135 --> 31:45.871
In a warehouse near the wall.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.306
I can go there tonight,
kill her,

31:48.340 --> 31:51.309
and bring back
what you desire.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.011
Tonight?

31:53.044 --> 31:54.246
As soon as that?

31:54.279 --> 31:55.480
Absolutely.

31:55.514 --> 32:02.220
All your worries will be over,
and your strength restored.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.221
Indeed.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.990
Do not trust her
with the amulet.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.525
I mean, do you wanna
tag along?

32:06.558 --> 32:08.427
Fine, but I am not looking
out for you.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.161
I don't want you‐

32:09.194 --> 32:10.228
Silence.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.132
Go immediately.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.967
Release the part of me
that she stole

32:16.001 --> 32:19.171
and bring back
the Van Helsing head.

32:19.204 --> 32:20.405
Right‐ right now?

32:20.439 --> 32:21.406
Of course, my darling.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.910
Why wait when there
is so much to gain?

32:24.943 --> 32:28.547
Or is there another reason
you wish to delay?

32:28.580 --> 32:29.881
Fine.

32:29.915 --> 32:31.583
Let's go then.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.418
Not you, my dear.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.188
Bathory will take care of this.

32:37.055 --> 32:38.890
Just her?

32:39.224 --> 32:41.026
Thank you, my love.

32:41.059 --> 32:43.562
I will not fail you.

32:43.995 --> 32:44.930
But I'm the one that found her

32:44.963 --> 32:47.666
and she has failed you
time and time again.

32:47.699 --> 32:51.036
Are you questioning
my decisions?

32:51.069 --> 32:53.438
Do I need to remind you
that I have called

32:53.472 --> 32:56.208
for your execution once before?

32:56.241 --> 32:57.909
She's the whole reason
that execution was botched

32:57.943 --> 32:58.910
in the first place!

32:58.944 --> 33:00.145
She‐

33:00.178 --> 33:01.246
Shh.

33:01.279 --> 33:05.350
You will stay here.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.452
And you will bring me
what I desire

33:07.486 --> 33:10.922
or you, my love, will die.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.913
I'll gather as much firepower
as possible,

33:34.946 --> 33:35.680
as many troops.

33:35.714 --> 33:36.948
My people will be ready.

33:36.982 --> 33:39.684
I should be able to get 50 or
more fighters by tomorrow night.

33:39.718 --> 33:40.685
Let me know if you need
any help.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.089
And how are we gonna trap her,
you know, magic?

33:44.122 --> 33:45.423
We're gonna have to throw
a lot at her‐

33:45.457 --> 33:47.459
Shh. Wait. Quiet.

33:47.492 --> 33:48.360
What?

33:48.393 --> 33:51.530
I just... I thought
I heard something.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.003
Ambush!

33:58.036 --> 34:05.710
[gunfire]

34:13.652 --> 34:14.419
You guys go!

34:14.452 --> 34:15.287
You guys go!

34:15.320 --> 34:16.154
Go!

34:16.187 --> 34:17.188
Go!

34:20.325 --> 34:21.259
Ahhhhh!!!!

34:22.027 --> 34:25.096
[gunfire continues]

34:25.397 --> 34:27.465
[cries out]

34:29.200 --> 34:32.637
[groaning]

34:36.141 --> 34:37.309
Kill her!

34:37.809 --> 34:39.644
[gun shots]

34:41.079 --> 34:44.683
[choking]

34:58.229 --> 34:59.197
Breathe. Breathe.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.198
Where's Vanessa?

35:00.231 --> 35:02.434
I don't know, this wasn't
part of the plan.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.439
You should have let me go.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.274
The stakes are too high.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.176
My thoughts exactly.

35:13.044 --> 35:17.349
Bathory has been by my side
for centuries.

35:17.382 --> 35:21.653
She may have her faults
but she worships me

35:21.686 --> 35:25.357
with every fibre of her being.

35:25.390 --> 35:28.193
But you?

35:28.226 --> 35:30.228
How could I trust you
with the amulet?

35:30.261 --> 35:34.799
With a piece of myself?

35:34.833 --> 35:37.636
Trust me?

35:37.669 --> 35:44.676
I‐ I put my life on the line
just by coming to you.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.145
Yes.

35:47.178 --> 35:51.683
But you are not
telling me everything.

35:51.716 --> 35:58.757
For instance, how did you know
that my spirit was trapped

35:58.790 --> 36:01.393
in that vial around
the Van Helsing neck?

36:01.426 --> 36:04.429
How could you know that?

36:08.500 --> 36:12.137
[gunfire]

36:12.170 --> 36:13.204
You've gotta go, Jack.

36:13.238 --> 36:14.372
You gotta leave me, ok?

36:14.406 --> 36:15.640
You gotta go.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.209
[gunfire continues]

36:18.243 --> 36:19.210
Go!

36:19.244 --> 36:20.745
This might be our only shot.

36:20.779 --> 36:21.546
Do it.

36:21.579 --> 36:22.547
Go.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.449
[gunfire]

36:28.887 --> 36:29.888
Go!

36:29.921 --> 36:31.556
What are you doing?!

36:31.589 --> 36:33.291
Jack, no!

36:36.394 --> 36:37.328
Hey!

36:37.362 --> 36:41.399
Are you looking for someone,
or something?

36:41.433 --> 36:43.802
Come to me.

36:48.273 --> 36:52.210
I can feel my beloved's power
from here.

36:56.481 --> 36:58.349
[cries out]
Jack!

37:01.152 --> 37:03.922
You seem upset,
my child.

37:03.955 --> 37:08.126
Tell me all and your mind
will be at rest.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.499
I got curious.

37:14.532 --> 37:17.736
Eavesdropped a little.

37:17.769 --> 37:21.406
I should have come clean.

37:21.439 --> 37:29.714
The truth is I just wanted
to impress you a little.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.449
Perhaps.

37:34.185 --> 37:36.821
Perhaps not.

37:36.855 --> 37:48.600
But I find you an
intriguing mystery.

37:53.438 --> 37:57.408
Soon I will have
all the power I need

37:57.442 --> 38:02.180
to bring the humans
to their knees.

38:02.213 --> 38:06.551
The last Van Helsing is dying
as we speak.

38:07.585 --> 38:08.686
Come, Jack.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.289
Come and meet your death.

38:11.322 --> 38:12.857
No problem.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.527
Ah‐ah, close enough.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.763
First, the amulet.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.431
No!

38:22.667 --> 38:24.736
So tonight, my darling,

38:24.769 --> 38:28.673
you must stay with me
where you can do no harm.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.245
No!

38:37.448 --> 38:45.356
What a lovely gift your head
will make for my beloved.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.562
[cackles]

38:50.595 --> 38:57.802
[gun shots]

38:57.836 --> 38:59.237
[groans]

39:18.523 --> 39:30.535
[gunfire]

39:43.615 --> 39:46.484
[panting]

39:48.786 --> 39:49.988
[groans]

40:06.905 --> 40:07.906
Bite her!

40:10.975 --> 40:12.343
[gasps]

40:25.056 --> 40:26.591
Come on, Bathory.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.727
[vomiting]

40:32.964 --> 40:34.499
Bathory.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.101
Remember me?

40:37.135 --> 40:38.636
You're back.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.672
You're human.

40:45.677 --> 40:54.852
[speaking indistinctly]

41:02.593 --> 41:05.029
You're ok.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.397
I'm‐ I'm right here.

41:06.431 --> 41:07.565
[yelling indistinctly]

41:07.598 --> 41:08.099
It's ok!

41:08.132 --> 41:08.533
It's ok!

41:08.566 --> 41:09.834
I'm a friend.

41:09.867 --> 41:10.802
Hang on to her.

41:10.835 --> 41:11.736
I'm trying!

41:11.769 --> 41:12.670
What's happening?

41:12.704 --> 41:14.005
I don't know.

41:14.038 --> 41:15.039
It's ok.

41:16.841 --> 41:17.642
It's ok.

41:17.675 --> 41:18.609
You're safe.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.712
It's ok. It's ok.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.716
She's gone.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.554
She's gone.

41:43.468 --> 41:46.671
I thought you were kinda done
with her, to be honest.

41:48.473 --> 41:52.477
[choking]

41:52.510 --> 41:56.080
Why were you so eager to go
with her?

41:56.114 --> 42:00.818
Because I knew she would fail.

42:00.852 --> 42:01.786
Yes.

42:01.819 --> 42:04.022
Or to ensure she did.

42:04.055 --> 42:07.058
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

42:08.726 --> 42:09.927
You.

42:10.561 --> 42:11.662
You.

42:13.664 --> 42:19.904
You were working
with the Van Helsing.

42:19.937 --> 42:25.843
You came here with her blood
to set things in motion.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.979
No.

42:28.012 --> 42:35.186
It was you trapping me in the
Dark Realm as a way to break me.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.755
It only made me stronger.

42:37.789 --> 42:40.792
More powerful.

42:40.825 --> 42:45.563
You can't harm me.

42:45.596 --> 42:47.932
Maybe it's time we found out.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.703
[screams]
