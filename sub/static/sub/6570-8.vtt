00:07.720 --> 00:10.041
- AMY: Hey, Gary. How you doing?
- Good. Good. Good.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.565
So, he's not... This isn't yours?

00:11.760 --> 00:14.843
- It's my nephew.
- Cute, I imagine.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.400
I'll tell you what, kid. Here's a Jackson.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.211
Go get yourself 10 sodas
and you never saw us.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.282
Or just water. Just choose water.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.362
- Wow! This is weird.
- AMY: Hmm.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.487
It's been a long time

00:27.560 --> 00:29.050
-since I've seen you guys. Wow.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.531
Did you see those pictures that I sent you?

00:30.600 --> 00:32.807
No, I didn't, Gary.
And why the fuck are we here?

00:32.880 --> 00:35.884
Okay, easy, easy. It's anonymous.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.803
Just pretend like you're parents,
checking this place out.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.731
- Paint something.
- I don't even paint my own nails, Gary.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.370
A Vietnamese lady does that.

00:42.880 --> 00:43.961
Talk or we leave.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.883
It's the Families First bill.
It's a difficult time for the President.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.724
Gary, I am very good at my job,

00:49.800 --> 00:51.928
and even I can't get people to vote
for that heap of mystery meat.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.209
It's not that. It's the opposite.
She wants it to go away.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.089
So, Selina needs to lose the vote

00:57.200 --> 00:59.680
and you want us to lobby
members of Congress under the wire.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.401
I am so glad I left.
She has gone full Colonel Kurtz.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.209
Is she giving orders from under the desk?

01:05.280 --> 01:07.726
She doesn't even know about this, all right?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.211
And she's not gonna know about this.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.803
Okay, well, in that case,
I'm gonna say yes to this,

01:11.880 --> 01:13.041
but for one reason only.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.764
- Loyalty?
- Money.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.089
Can't you just do this for Selina?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.731
- No.
- Okay, well, I can't authorize that.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.165
Well, get Ben to.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.766
How'd you know Ben was involved?

01:22.840 --> 01:25.366
- Okay.
- Because he's not.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.165
- Right.
- This is getting completely out of hand.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.401
No, no, it isn't.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.610
We just accepted your proposal
and we'll be in touch with the figures.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.966
Okay, all right. Thank you.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.441
No, no, no. You want to blow our cover?

01:37.520 --> 01:40.046
Nobody shakes hands in a craft shop.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.764
You know, at least three of these kids
are probably mine.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.841
Okay.

<i>A big day for President Meyer
as her beleaguered Families First bill</i>

02:01.040 --> 02:02.804
<i>faces the final vote. Will Congress...</i>

02:02.880 --> 02:04.245
- What are you doing?
- What?

02:04.320 --> 02:07.642
Why are the flowers in front of it?
I can't see it if the flowers are there.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.961
- Oh, God.
-(SNEEZING) Oh, God.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.441
No, no, let me get that,
you sweet little invalid.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.488
I'm not an invalid. I'm completely fine.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.289
- These are empty.
- I don't know how I got this.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.930
It's from meeting people, I guess.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.806
God, Gary, I wish to Jesus that you had
gotten this flu instead of me.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.325
Oh, my God, me, too. Me, too.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.084
KENT: All right, here we go.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.366
- Put it right there.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

02:26.440 --> 02:30.001
She needs to nap. She needs to nap.
And that is a Gary Walsh executive order.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.606
- Duly noted.
- Gary, I'm completely fine, okay?

02:32.680 --> 02:35.490
I'm just working from home today. My God.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.525
Okay, coast is clear.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.728
Two hundred and eleven
are voting against the bill.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.007
Five undecided. And we've got three yeses

02:43.080 --> 02:45.651
that we're working on
turning around into nos.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.169
So, defeat is within our grasp.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.321
MIKE: Ma'am.
SELINA: Yes?

02:50.440 --> 02:51.441
Here's an iPad

02:51.520 --> 02:52.760
-with that voice memo app I like.
- Oh.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.161
There's also a cool tile game on here
if you want to play a game.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.846
- A what? A tile?
- Which, of course, you don't want to play.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.001
Is that Families First?

02:59.080 --> 03:00.969
Yeah, it's really close,
but we're doing our best to lose it.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.964
Can I just restate how difficult
me knowing this makes my job?

03:04.120 --> 03:05.849
Which is already extremely difficult.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.208
We have to lose the vote
to have a chance of winning the election.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.691
We kill the bill, we end the criticism.

03:10.760 --> 03:14.481
I'm the press secretary.
What I don't know, I can't lie about.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.722
Including this, whatever this is.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.046
Well, you don't need to lie about this.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.531
We're asking people to vote yes.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.523
We're doing what we should be doing.
We're just doing it badly.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.965
(SNEEZING)

03:23.040 --> 03:24.087
- Bless you.
-(SELINA GROANS)

03:24.800 --> 03:27.246
I think I just sneezed up part of my pancreas.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.001
Don't worry, Mike.
We have a team of our worst people on this.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.243
Cazzelli, Lennox. The usual saps.
Jonah, Richard.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.051
I didn't hear any of this
because the acoustics are so bad.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.966
Sue, this is a test memo. Send memo.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.202
- What is this?
-lt's a footstool.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.768
Oh, yeah, I feel so much better.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.889
JONAH: Sir, this is a great bill.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.850
And sometimes it takes
a great man to see greatness.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.251
Are you a great man?

03:52.320 --> 03:56.245
Title four, section seven
negates the entire point of the legislation.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.564
How did they write this thing?
Get drunk and tape crayons to their feet?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.086
Well, what if I told you that was gone?

04:02.160 --> 04:03.491
But it isn't gone, is it?

04:03.560 --> 04:06.245
- No, sir, it's still there.
- But what if it was gone?

04:06.320 --> 04:07.924
- Oh! That's a good point.
- Thank you.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.248
And so you're the best
the White House has to offer?

04:10.320 --> 04:13.005
- Yes, sir.
- Two giant children in their dads' suits.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.523
Uh, sir, we have a folder
full of numbers here,

04:17.600 --> 04:21.685
and I think you'll find these numbers
just to be great, great numbers.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.321
Saying what?

04:24.400 --> 04:27.483
- Uh, Richard, what do the numbers say?
- You haven't read the numbers.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.803
We've glanced at the numbers, sir,
and at first glance, they are very compelling.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.769
- You know where the door is.
- Sir, if there's anything...

04:32.840 --> 04:35.127
Wait. You work for President Meyer.
You don't know where the door is.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.167
I'll show you. It's over here.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.403
Sir, you may or may not know
that I ran a multimillion-dollar website.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.051
So if I can offer any web design or support...

04:42.120 --> 04:43.884
Sir, can I ask you
how you're gonna vote today?

04:43.960 --> 04:46.201
- No.
-ls that no as in I can't ask you or no as in...

04:46.640 --> 04:48.927
GARY: Hey, Sue, have you seen my bag?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.809
Whoa! What's going on?

04:50.880 --> 04:52.644
This is my area.
She needs quiet. What's going on?

04:52.720 --> 04:54.085
Put it right there in the corner. Thank you.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.527
No, no, no. You can't do this.
You cannot do this.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.206
<i>SELINA: Sue, I need you to set up
an office outside the bedroom.</i>

04:59.280 --> 05:01.009
Okay. (LAUGHING)

05:01.960 --> 05:04.770
You're not the only one who's important, Sue.

<i>Can I have a hot water with lemon and honey?</i>

05:09.800 --> 05:10.801
See?

05:10.880 --> 05:12.405
You should get on that, Gary.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.444
Uh, I know.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.924
So, Tom, how are you finding our President?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.809
Oh, you know, presidential.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.805
It's like she wants to run
the whole damn country.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.407
You know what?
The last guy, he was the same way.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.926
We agreed, if she's gonna stay president,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.082
we have to do everything
we can to stop that bill.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.965
So, are you?

05:34.040 --> 05:35.963
You know, you just started
that last sentence with a "we"

05:36.040 --> 05:37.530
and you finished it with a "you."

05:37.600 --> 05:40.570
- Are you making progress?
- Yeah, I'm on it. I got Richard and Jonah...

05:40.640 --> 05:43.849
Oh! Ben,
I don't need to know what you're doing.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.684
- I just need to get it done.
-(DOOR OPENING)

05:45.760 --> 05:49.560
Huge, huge fight. Even the bride got involved.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.244
- No.
- Amazing.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.731
There is nothing like a Boston wedding.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.290
- Let me tell you that.
- Wow!

05:54.360 --> 05:56.283
That was worryingly good, Tom.

05:56.360 --> 06:00.285
I mean, that was some black belt jujitsu
bullshit right there.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.521
KENT: I have to go. We'll take this up
in eight minutes' time.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.967
- You are clear to go in.
- You can't go in there.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.211
SELINA: <i>Kent, you can come straight in.
If Gary tries to stop you, you can ignore him.</i>

06:12.440 --> 06:14.442
Well, I have a memo saying
that she needs rest.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.961
- When was yours sent?
- When was yours sent?

06:17.160 --> 06:18.286
I asked you first.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.571
I'll have to check my phone.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.008
Ma'am, I know it's difficult
when you're running the free world,

06:23.080 --> 06:24.605
but you should really get some rest.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.490
Yeah... (CLEARS THROAT)
Or maybe I can get a new doctor.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.006
In which case, I'll just say
keep taking the fluids, ma'am.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.251
Moyes is voting no. Good news...

06:33.320 --> 06:34.321
For the other side.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.243
- That's so bad.
- I know, I know.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.401
- So bad.
- Yeah.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.127
Have you heard about Moyes? It's incredible...

06:40.200 --> 06:44.250
How short-sighted some people can be.
Unbelievable.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.084
Unbelievable, that's what we were saying.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.004
- I'll check back on you later, ma'am.
- Okay, thank you. (CLEARS THROAT)

06:50.760 --> 06:53.286
Okay, congratulations, ma'am.
So great about Moyes.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.806
We're now only four votes away
from killing your bill.

06:56.040 --> 07:00.250
I feel like I'm captain of the Titanic
and I carved out the iceberg myself.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.766
Okay, ma'am, I think you just need
to take a little power nap.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.491
- You need to rest, okay?
- Yeah, I think maybe I'm gonna rest.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.085
- Yeah, just rest your body.
- Yeah.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.730
Ma'am, are you ready for your next meeting?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.928
- SecDef is here.
- Okay, no. (CHUCKLES)

07:11.000 --> 07:15.210
It's okay. I can sleep when I'm dead
in about an hour.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.367
There is nothing good to be said
about Families First.

07:19.960 --> 07:23.567
Not since Herod
has there been a piece of legislation

07:23.640 --> 07:25.847
so damaging to average families.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.888
Sir, if you want to help working families,

07:27.960 --> 07:29.485
-this is not it.
- Mmm-mmm.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.130
This is akin to carrying out heart surgery

07:31.200 --> 07:32.281
-with a pair of spoons.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.522
I don't need to be ridden
by you two lobby horses

07:34.640 --> 07:37.041
to know that this bill
is a waste of bowel space.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.163
- Well, that's great.
-(CHUCKLES) Fantastic.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.967
It is nice to meet somebody in politics

07:43.040 --> 07:44.804
who knows what he's talking about
for a change.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.611
Yeah, Congressman, I'm just gonna
leave you, now, with some numbers.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.524
And, spoiler alert, they do not add up.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.690
This is the same folder that Jonah Ryan had.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.608
Wait, you met with Jonah Ryan?

07:55.680 --> 07:57.569
Six-foot waxwork and his cuddly boyfriend?

07:58.080 --> 08:00.128
- That would be him.
- So you don't work for the White House,

08:00.200 --> 08:01.884
but you have the same numbers.
Well, now, I'm interested.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.729
Now, I am deeply fucking interested.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.651
We have the same Office Depot folder
as they do.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.882
Call the Washington <i>Post.</i> I smell conspiracy.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.566
Okay, sure, so why is this one shaking
like Elvis' leg?

08:12.400 --> 08:15.290
You know, I'm starting to get the feeling
that Meyer wants her own bill to fail.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.290
I think I've just re-boarded
the vote yes express.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.924
Meyer is a stand-in president.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.004
Don't you think it's time
we have someone who is qualified?

08:28.080 --> 08:31.129
The President is qualified to be president
because she is president.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.211
Does your party have a candidate
who is president?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.203
- SELINA: <i>I like that.</i> (COUGHING)

that Tom's gonna wear...

08:45.240 --> 08:47.208
I'm sorry, ma'am. What was that? I didn't...

08:47.280 --> 08:51.126
Oh. No, I was just sending a memo.
I didn't want to keep interrupting all the time.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.289
That is very considerate. Thank you.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.770
This is no way to run a civilized society.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.841
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

08:57.920 --> 09:00.127
I believe... What is that?

09:00.200 --> 09:03.044
It's a memo from the President.
Go ahead, it's not important.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.567
<i>It is important, Ben.
Every memo I send is important.</i>

09:07.040 --> 09:09.042
Send memo. Jesus.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.406
BILL: I'm not getting any memos.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.970
-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
- Oh! Now, lam.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.405
SELINA: Go ahead, Tom.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.487
Okay.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.406
Well, Senator, to return to my...

09:18.480 --> 09:21.086
And you've got to, um, be aggressive, though,
you know?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.764
<i>Man up here a little bit.</i>

09:22.840 --> 09:24.330
- Be aggressive?
- Yeah.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.770
I'm starting to get really angry, Senator.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.168
I'm starting to feel that you're not really
listening to me, Senator.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.971
And I'm getting sick
of your constant interruptions.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.203
<i>What the fuck? Moyes is voting yes?</i>

09:38.280 --> 09:40.044
Moyes was 100% no.

09:40.120 --> 09:43.727
<i>Moyes is a no.
Ben, Moyes was supposed to be 100% no.</i>

09:43.800 --> 09:47.964
That's it. I'm throwing the debate.
You win, pretend opponent.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.361
Wait a second, Kent had a list
who Jonah and Richard were seeing

09:50.440 --> 09:51.805
and you had a list who
Dan and Amy were seeing?

09:51.880 --> 09:53.120
Did you not think to compare the lists?

09:53.200 --> 09:55.601
You know, I have another list,
and you're right at the top of it, Gary,

09:55.680 --> 09:58.570
so don't you dare try to question
my fucking methods.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.769
Well, I, on the other hand,
do dare to question your fucking methods.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.127
Well, Kent and I were running
different parts of the operation.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.682
So your people are going to see
the same people as Jonah and Richard?

10:07.760 --> 10:09.524
One. One of the same people.

10:09.680 --> 10:13.730
Oh, one. So one's okay.
We just let off one nuke at the Super Bowl.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.604
Oh, so now, you want to micromanage

10:15.680 --> 10:17.887
something that you didn't
even want to be involved in.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.246
I don't want to manage it, but don't you think

10:19.320 --> 10:22.130
we could maybe find
someone competent who could?

10:22.200 --> 10:24.601
Okay, whatever it is, I don't need to know.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.364
I'll tell you what's going on.
Jonah saw Moyes earlier today

10:26.440 --> 10:27.521
and Dan and Amy have, too.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.806
And, now, Moyes is onto us.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.120
Why did you just tell me that?

10:30.200 --> 10:31.440
This is so much worse for me.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.727
I was the field agent
who gave Dan and Amy the mission.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.802
I was the messenger. I could be shot.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.362
Oh, this isn't about you, Gary.
Jesus, nothing here is ever about you.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.966
I didn't hear any of this
'cause I have a really bad case of tinnitus,

10:42.040 --> 10:44.850
especially when discussing
morally dubious things.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.410
So, it's kind of like sinnitus.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.006
But I'm implicated. I'm the linchpin.
I could go to jail!

10:49.080 --> 10:50.320
-shut up!
-shut up!

10:50.400 --> 10:52.129
No, you shut up. You shut up.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.802
And I will also shut up first.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.646
Sue! Sue, I need to see the President.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.842
She's in with the joint chiefs, Gary.
ls it that important?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.843
Listen, Sue, I'm involved with some stuff here.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.242
Scary stuff, like,
take-it-to-your-grave kind of stuff.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.571
And that's the... That's the way I like it.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.325
Okay, well, she'll be out in five. Can it wait?

11:12.440 --> 11:14.090
Yeah, no problem. No problem.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.607
What if he checks our cover story?
Like, what if he informs Congress?

11:17.680 --> 11:19.523
Dan, he's a congressman.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.841
Congressmen never do anything
they say they're gonna do.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.491
- How are you not freaking out about this?
-(BLUBBERS)

11:24.560 --> 11:27.530
I'm kind of having fun.
I like having a cover story.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.648
Makes me feel like a Charlie's Angel.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.245
God, it was a rush!

11:31.320 --> 11:33.766
Yeah, but you're a control freak,
and this whole thing is out of control,

11:33.880 --> 11:34.881
so why aren't you freaking?

11:34.960 --> 11:37.486
Relax. I'm finally having fun. Let me.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.846
Jesus, you know,
I always thought the old Amy

11:38.920 --> 11:40.922
was kind of an uptight bitch,
but now, I sort of miss her.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.527
You know, if I was uptight,
I'd be offended by that.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.371
In fact, I am offended.
You shouldn't call people bitches.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.965
- You shouldn't do that anymore.
-(STARTS ENGINE)

11:48.040 --> 11:50.361
Unless it's like (SING-SONGY)
"bitch" or something like that.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.006
MAN 1: I'm sorry.
MAN 2: Excuse me.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.081
Thank you for your service.

11:54.120 --> 11:58.011
- BEN: How was the meeting, sir?
- Very productive.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.126
(GARY GASPS)

12:01.760 --> 12:03.888
It's like something out of a political cartoon.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.606
What, you mean not funny?

12:05.720 --> 12:07.006
(SIGHING) on, my God.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.407
How the hell did Moyes end up on two lists?

12:09.480 --> 12:13.087
I made it clear, Ben should run
all his list alterations past me.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.243
No, no, mine was the master list.
Your list was a sub-list.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.005
It was a sur-list, which means over-list.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.924
- Oh, fuck you.
- Your earwax could bring down a president.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.764
GARY: And I didn't even
want to see Dan and Amy.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.569
And now they're expecting money.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.330
- I didn't know that.
- Money? Money?

12:27.400 --> 12:29.084
Gary, I said access only.

12:29.640 --> 12:33.042
Yeah, now we're gonna have to divert funds
from the campaign, and that's fraud.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.724
And then we're gonna have
to destroy the evidence,

12:34.800 --> 12:36.768
and that's conspiracy to commit fraud.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.049
- No, a cash trail is very fucking bad for us.
- Oh.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.849
Hey, hold on there, Hunk of the Month.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.730
If I'm going down, you're going down, too.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.044
I don't know what this is about.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.764
Good point. Dan and Amy.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.570
They're getting paid cash
from the campaign fund

12:50.640 --> 12:52.085
to bring down the bill.

12:52.280 --> 12:56.285
There, you've been blooded.
So join the circle jerk. Grab a dick.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.486
Wish I could hear what you were saying

12:57.560 --> 13:00.006
-over that incessant drilling sound.
- What are you doing?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.445
(SELINA COUGHING)

13:03.440 --> 13:04.885
<i>What cash'?</i>

13:05.520 --> 13:07.204
What Dan and Amy?

13:07.280 --> 13:09.123
Ben's paying Dan and Amy
to lobby against the bill,

13:09.200 --> 13:11.202
and now there's a cash trail
and we're all incriminated.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.808
But you're not. (LAUGHING)

13:13.880 --> 13:15.245
Oh, my God, now you are!

13:16.720 --> 13:20.167
Well done. Now I feel a lot better.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.131
Did you know, Tom?

13:22.200 --> 13:26.649
Ma'am, I am as shocked as you are.
Shocked and disappointed, Ben.

13:26.720 --> 13:31.647
Ma'am, Moyes is voting yes.
Ruiz is voting yes.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.564
This comes down to one vote.
We need Congressman Pierce.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.129
My future depends on that dumb fucking elf?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.126
Jesus... Where is he?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.485
OWEN: I'm so proud
of how brave you've been.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.891
I was looking for some lotion,
but they didn't...

13:44.320 --> 13:46.846
Hello, Congressman Pierce, Mrs. Pierce.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.400
We are here from the White House
on behalf of the Families First bill.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.280
Oh, yes.
Mom, the White House here to see me.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.600
We need you to vote for the bill.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.486
More importantly, the President needs you
to vote for the bill.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.722
The President?
The President sent you here to talk to me?

13:59.800 --> 14:01.643
She used sentences containing your name.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.522
Okay, I'm in. I mean, yeah, absolutely.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.284
- Fantastic!
- Mom, the President needs me to...

14:06.360 --> 14:08.840
Oh, no, Joker and Penguin beat us to it.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.207
Hey, guys. Uh, you're here just in time
to celebrate.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.886
The congressman is going to vote yes
on the Families First bill.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.201
It was a personal request
from the President, so...

14:16.280 --> 14:18.681
Uh... Congressman, now,
while I respect your decision,

14:18.760 --> 14:22.048
you do understand that the amendments
to this bill will negatively affect your district.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.202
AMY: Hardworking families
don't want to support lazy ones.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.520
- That's right.
- And your support will shrink

14:25.600 --> 14:27.728
faster than a penis in the December Hudson.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.371
- Really?
- You shit-eating cocksuckers.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.522
I'm sorry, Mrs. Pierce.
How dare you come in here

14:32.640 --> 14:36.008
and try to strong-arm a person when
he's sitting at his sick mother's bedside?

14:36.080 --> 14:37.730
That's exactly what you just did, dumbass.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.484
Don't tell me what I did or did not just do.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.005
Could you guys please keep the noise down?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.889
There's a lot of really sick people
on this floor.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.645
Yes, there are. I see two very sick people.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.007
Those two.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.963
SUE: All right, ma'am,
I've just spoken to Amy.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.725
Her and Dan are with Pierce
and his mom at the hospital.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.724
- But there's been a holdup.
- Oh, God.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.441
She's probably gonna die just to spite me.
That evil bitch.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.683
And Richard and Jonah are there.
And I blame Kent and Bill for that.

15:00.760 --> 15:04.162
Well, this is a long glass
of frozen strawberry fuckup.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.526
GARY: Hey, listen, Ben,
you've got to do something.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.887
I don't want to be a bagman
for the toughest guy in D block.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.850
- All right, stop it, Gary.
- Okay, look, get Pierce here.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.048
Okay? Right now. (COUGHING)

15:13.320 --> 15:15.482
I'm gonna take control of this situation

15:15.600 --> 15:18.285
that I don't know anything about, right?

15:18.360 --> 15:21.364
Because I am the only one who seems to be...

15:22.000 --> 15:23.764
(COUGHING)

15:27.000 --> 15:28.206
Capable.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.930
- Oh, God.

- You are not taking him.
- His jittery ass is mine.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.370
- Guys, I'm right here.
-l'm sorry, your jittery ass is the President's.

15:43.440 --> 15:47.240
You shouldn't even be here, Jonah,
unless you're giving your brain to science.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.608
I'm here on behalf of the President, Amy.
Do you remember her?

15:50.720 --> 15:54.202
She's the woman that would have fired you
if you hadn't gone fucking Fukushima.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.090
RICHARD: That's right, we're on a mission.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.881
I am surprised the two of you even found
your way out of your own mothers' vaginas.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.281
Oh, my God, dude, I got out of there
like I had a fucking map.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.727
How about a little bit of consideration
for a dying woman?

16:04.800 --> 16:07.087
Oh, I'm not dying. I'm just here for some tests.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.844
Okay, pipe down. Wait, where's Pierce?

16:08.920 --> 16:10.126
Wait, where's Amy?

16:11.400 --> 16:13.368
JONAH: No, no, no, no! No, no. Ah!

16:13.800 --> 16:15.245
- That's Amy.
- Shit!

- Oh, my...
- Yeah, what a shame.

Look, you think I want to be in
this fucking Minecraft piece of shit?

16:26.760 --> 16:31.766
I am an emissary of the President
and I demand that you get out of my car.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.366
You colossal fucking fanny pack.
You don't get it, do you?

16:34.440 --> 16:36.681
They only sent you 'cause they knew
that you would fuck it up.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.843
You're so stupid, you don't even know
that you're being used for your stupidity.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.527
That's bullshit, Dan. I can tell from your eyes
and because it's fucking bullshit.

- Where's Richard?

16:45.320 --> 16:46.765

- No, it's just a glitch.

- This is your car, right?
- Yep. See? Fixed it.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.771
RICHARD: Okay.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.889
DAN: You're backing up?
Just fucking go straight.

JONAH: I took a precision driving class, Dan.
I think I know what I'm doing.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.685
Ma'am, we've lost Pierce. I'm sorry.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.048
We should have hired Navy SEALs
instead of those two actual seals.

17:10.119 --> 17:11.359
How do you lose a whole person?

17:11.440 --> 17:13.965
- A cuff link I get, but not a person.

Moyes thinks the White House

Gary in the shit. You need to get him out.

I don't even know what the fuck you are.

Guys, my mom is too ill
to be left alone right now.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.923
I mean, I left her alone right now
because she likes to read.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.402
But she can't read right now
because she's very sick.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.161

Or she might not get better.

- Good for her.

make a difference in people's lives.

Ma'am, you're the President.
It's not for me to tell you what to do.

- No, we're taking the credit.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.088
How about a compromise?
We'll take all of the credit.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.561
- Well, perhaps we could split the bounty?
- What bounty?

20:43.640 --> 20:45.847
Well, I'm guessing there's no bounty, but...

20:45.920 --> 20:48.082
Dan, Amy, how are you? I'll take it from here.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.083
- I want to take in Pierce.
- No, no, no.

We are not going into the White House
and blowing our cover for this guy.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.167
You can't come in.
That comes from the President.

Hey, we got to get moving. Hey, you guys.
Long time no see.

You're the fucking press secretary.

of plausible deniability.

- Yeah.

The President needs you
to do something for her.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.844

21:38.920 --> 21:41.127
-you deserve a better job.
- Yes.
