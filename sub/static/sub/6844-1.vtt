"Golden dreams
and great heartache,"

03:36.677 --> 03:45.447
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river...called life."

03:47.808 --> 03:57.027
"When great mountains lay
in its path,"

03:58.858 --> 04:03.658
"it cuts deep gorges through
the rock...to keep flowing!.."

04:10.831 --> 04:15.631
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life..."

04:28.128 --> 04:34.136
"It is called
the river of life."

07:17.697 --> 07:19.139
Lord Shiva!

07:22.622 --> 07:24.392
For all the sins
I have committed,

07:24.544 --> 07:26.870
if death is the only redemption,
then take my life!...

07:27.067 --> 07:30.639
But this boy should live...

07:31.271 --> 07:35.597
He should live for his mother
who is waiting for him...

07:35.596 --> 07:38.687
he should live to ascend
the throne Mahishmati...

07:38.879 --> 07:42.287
Mahendra Baahubali should live!

08:13.953 --> 08:15.002
Dear me!

08:20.200 --> 08:22.210
Hey! What are you
waiting for? Hurry!

08:24.885 --> 08:26.447
Hey! Be careful!

08:50.470 --> 08:52.917
What happened?
- I am not sure, master.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.314
With all the jewelry on her,

08:54.314 --> 08:55.723
she must have been
a queen or something.

08:55.715 --> 08:57.921
She died with her
hand pointing up!

09:01.361 --> 09:02.409
Master!

09:05.445 --> 09:06.493
What happened?

09:06.486 --> 09:08.212
They must have come
here to kill her.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.698
Looks like she got
the better of them.

09:13.413 --> 09:14.461
Master!

09:18.297 --> 09:19.947
My God! A cave!

09:19.939 --> 09:22.222
We never knew this existed!

09:24.264 --> 09:26.634
Looks like it goes all the way
to the top of the mountain!

09:27.027 --> 09:29.791
If the lady was holding the
baby up, pointing to the top,

09:29.950 --> 09:31.632
Maybe she wanted us
to take it back there!

09:31.631 --> 09:33.040
You are out of your mind?

09:33.233 --> 09:35.559
They sent soldiers
to kill an infant!

09:35.716 --> 09:36.884
What dangers do
you think await him...

09:36.876 --> 09:38.798
if you send him back there!
- But, Sanga..

09:40.280 --> 09:41.645
This is my baby.

09:42.321 --> 09:43.567
I have no children...

09:43.723 --> 09:45.372
and the river Goddess
has given this boy to me.

09:46.006 --> 09:50.298
If anyone of you object,
I will trample upon your necks.

09:50.570 --> 09:53.541
What are you waiting for?
Close the cave.

10:04.143 --> 10:05.192
Shiva!

10:08.708 --> 10:09.833
Shiva!

10:11.231 --> 10:12.880
What are you doing here,
my dear?

10:12.872 --> 10:14.599
What is up there, mother?

10:22.642 --> 10:24.685
There are ghosts
and demons up there!

10:24.684 --> 10:26.695
They prey on
and eat little kids!

10:26.686 --> 10:28.488
But I want to go up there,
mother!

10:28.608 --> 10:30.814
Don't ever say you want
to go up there! Let us go.

10:49.589 --> 10:51.959
How many times have I told you
not to climb up there?

10:51.951 --> 10:53.677
Why do you keep doing it?

10:53.673 --> 10:56.284
You are my darling, right?
You won't do it again, right?

11:46.446 --> 11:48.172
Looks like he will
make it this time.

11:48.168 --> 11:50.451
No way!
Look at the water mountain!

11:50.450 --> 11:51.892
It goes way up into the clouds...

11:52.012 --> 11:53.060
...And how many times has he fallen
from that hundred feet?

11:53.052 --> 11:53.893
He always slips and falls
after the first hundred feet.

11:54.054 --> 11:55.616
Yeah, he slipped and fell
at least a hundred times.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.225
Watch!
He is going to come sliding down again.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.017
Shiva!

12:34.014 --> 12:36.581
Your mother is up to something there!

12:37.496 --> 12:44.388
'Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva!'

12:45.305 --> 12:46.594
That is fifteen!

12:46.866 --> 12:50.558
Pour another 101 times and
your prayers will be answered!

12:51.151 --> 12:54.635
Sage, if I do this,
will my son listen to me?

12:55.155 --> 12:56.761
Will he stop trying to climb
up that mountain?

12:56.916 --> 12:59.527
Of course!
This is a powerful ritual!

12:59.960 --> 13:02.407
Pour this water over Shiva,
with all your heart,

13:03.162 --> 13:05.805
and He will guide your son
onto the right path.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.935
Alright! 0! Sage.
- Hail Shiva!

13:08.808 --> 13:11.572
Mother, you are not
getting younger, are you?

13:12.251 --> 13:14.337
It won't help you if you
run around so much!

13:14.454 --> 13:16.704
Out of my way!
- Mother, please listen to me!

13:16.977 --> 13:19.139
Why should I?
Do you ever listen to me?

13:19.819 --> 13:21.862
Father, can you please
tell her to stop?

13:22.261 --> 13:23.791
Sanga?
- What?

13:24.183 --> 13:26.346
Where are the flowers?
- Father! Father!

13:26.346 --> 13:27.274
Let go of me!

13:27.507 --> 13:29.790
Alright! Let me do it on your behalf.
Okay?

13:30.069 --> 13:32.559
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

13:33.633 --> 13:36.003
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water!

13:36.556 --> 13:39.407
Sire, carry on with what you are doing.
- Hail Lord Shiva!

13:40.119 --> 13:42.008
Mother.
- What is it now?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.332
How about I carry you...

13:44.444 --> 13:46.366
and you can pour the water
over Lord Shiva? Fine?

13:46.366 --> 13:48.616
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

13:48.608 --> 13:51.010
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water

13:51.171 --> 13:53.060
and she has to walk up
to pour the water!

13:55.015 --> 13:58.587
Sage, are you and your Shiva
planning to kill my mother?

13:58.578 --> 14:01.822
How should I know what
the Lord has in store?

14:09.029 --> 14:10.110
Lord Shiva!

14:11.671 --> 14:13.036
Sanga!

14:13.032 --> 14:15.162
See what your lad is up to now!

14:15.514 --> 14:16.956
What is it this time?

14:22.762 --> 14:24.773
Shiva, stop!

14:25.685 --> 14:30.370
You will go to hell for this
blasphemy! Shiva, stop!

14:35.575 --> 14:36.743
Shiva.

14:53.552 --> 14:54.633
Shiva, wait".

14:56.596 --> 15:01.249
"The celestial river agitatedly
moving through His matted hair"

15:01.360 --> 15:06.253
"which makes His head shine
with those soft waves."

15:10.730 --> 15:15.503
"And His forehead shining
like a brilliant fire"

15:15.494 --> 15:17.657
"and the crescent of moon which
is an ornament to His head"

15:17.817 --> 15:20.865
"makes my mind love Him
each and every moment."

15:25.465 --> 15:29.757
"Who is he and
where he comes from?

15:30.150 --> 15:34.715
"He brought with him eternal
light spreading everywhere."

15:34.874 --> 15:39.003
"His strong arms can turn
the tide of history."

15:39.559 --> 15:42.650
"River Bhagirathi, Lord Shiva
head towards you."

15:42.642 --> 15:47.415
"Look at this great irony."

16:14.313 --> 16:18.999
"The consort of the sportive
daughter of the mountain"

16:18.998 --> 16:25.169
"whose mind rejoices
at Her side long glances."

16:25.965 --> 16:30.651
"With the stream of merciful
look which removes hardships"

16:30.650 --> 16:32.900
â€œMakes my mind
take pleasure in Him"

16:33.092 --> 16:36.456
"who wears the directions
as apparel."

16:37.697 --> 16:40.144
"With the lustrous gem"

16:40.139 --> 16:42.422
"on the serpent's hood
in His matted locks."

16:42.421 --> 16:44.672
"He, who is with His bride
whose face is decorated"

16:44.824 --> 16:47.915
"by the melting of
red saffron vermillion."

16:51.791 --> 16:54.194
"And who wears on His shoulder
the hide of the elephant"

16:54.194 --> 16:56.597
"which was blind
with ferociousness."

16:56.596 --> 16:58.846
"Makes my mind happy
and contented in Him"

16:58.838 --> 17:02.169
"who is the leader of demons."

17:21.140 --> 17:22.342
Mother!

17:22.621 --> 17:24.751
Not just a thousand
showers for your Lord,

17:25.144 --> 17:28.115
He will bathe all the time now.
Are you happy now?

17:30.309 --> 17:31.357
Yes..

18:27.647 --> 18:30.411
Sage, it played out
just like you predicted!

18:30.770 --> 18:34.975
My son hasn't looked up
at that waterfall since.

18:35.095 --> 18:37.858
Do you ever underestimate
Lord Shiva's power?

18:38.337 --> 18:41.549
But now he sits staring
at the wooden mask

18:41.941 --> 18:45.513
that fell on the Shivalingam
from above.

18:45.665 --> 18:46.910
Now what is with that?

18:48.268 --> 18:51.631
Lord Shiva works
in mysterious ways.

18:51.791 --> 18:53.200
Only He would know.

18:53.593 --> 18:54.314
A small doubt.

18:54.314 --> 18:56.324
Since my son was
the one who made sure

18:56.315 --> 18:57.801
the idol is bathed
all the time.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.400
Will his wish of climbing
up the mountain come true

19:00.519 --> 19:01.841
or will Sanga's
wish of him always

19:02.001 --> 19:03.082
staying down here come true?

19:03.082 --> 19:06.655
To hell with your doubts.
My son did what he did for me!

19:07.006 --> 19:09.770
My wish will be fulfilled.
Isn't that right?

19:10.490 --> 19:14.816
Lord Shiva does whatever
He thinks. Hail Lord Shiva!

19:14.814 --> 19:16.583
Hail Lord Shiva!

19:17.697 --> 19:18.385
What did he say?

19:25.264 --> 19:26.313
Shiva!

19:26.305 --> 19:28.511
How long are you going
to sit holding that wooden mask?

19:28.507 --> 19:30.757
There is somebody up there.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.240
Maybe there is, but your mother
is calling out to you.

19:33.392 --> 19:35.675
Let us go home.
- Go ahead. I will come later.

19:35.914 --> 19:37.083
Let us go, boys.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.647
Who are you?
Why did you come to me?

20:51.310 --> 20:55.799
"My heart is lost."

20:57.156 --> 21:02.650
"Like a drop in the waves."

21:03.082 --> 21:08.292
"I am the one whose
eyes shine amidst the stars"

21:09.008 --> 21:11.891
"I am the one who
sings amidst the waterfalls"

21:12.051 --> 21:16.584
"My voice echoes through
streams, listen to me!"

21:18.017 --> 21:22.790
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

21:24.023 --> 21:28.709
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

21:29.949 --> 21:34.722
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

21:35.955 --> 21:41.449
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

22:11.350 --> 22:13.119
"I breathe for you..."

22:14.313 --> 22:16.115
"and only you"

22:17.436 --> 22:22.723
"Come and let us live together."

22:23.282 --> 22:28.055
"Let me tell you something,
my love."

22:29.809 --> 22:35.183
"I chose you as my soul mate."

22:35.695 --> 22:41.790
"Whether I stumble and fall,
with haste I will come."

22:41.781 --> 22:45.986
"I am but a sudden gust of wind.
I stop for no one."

22:46.145 --> 22:53.802
"I will break free of every
mountain in no time."

22:53.792 --> 22:58.326
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

22:59.759 --> 23:04.292
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

23:05.724 --> 23:10.213
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

23:11.691 --> 23:16.584
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

23:56.696 --> 24:01.495
"You come out of blue
with a gift of love."

24:08.827 --> 24:13.961
"Drop a word and I swear"

24:15.314 --> 24:19.923
"I will give up my life for you."

24:21.921 --> 24:27.415
"Scaling peak impossible, his
blood flows like a rivulet."

24:27.767 --> 24:33.338
"His sturdy body, a weapon.
Hail this hero of the world."

24:33.773 --> 24:39.507
"Destructive in the air and sky
can win with his roar of war."

24:39.778 --> 24:45.425
"A ferocious warrior will become
soft-hearted afterwards."

24:45.865 --> 24:48.629
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

24:48.787 --> 24:51.638
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

24:51.791 --> 24:54.838
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

24:54.833 --> 24:57.520
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

24:57.756 --> 25:00.608
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

25:00.759 --> 25:03.206
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

25:03.201 --> 25:07.855
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

25:09.168 --> 25:14.138
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

25:15.174 --> 25:20.308
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

25:21.179 --> 25:26.269
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

25:27.186 --> 25:28.475
"The persevering one.."

25:28.467 --> 25:33.240
"Hey, warrior. Come closer!"

25:34.513 --> 25:41.209
"Hey, handsome. You are mine."

26:40.619 --> 26:41.984
Hey!

26:44.463 --> 26:46.353
Hey! Stop!

26:51.109 --> 26:52.354
Stop!

27:05.924 --> 27:07.092
Over there!

27:26.825 --> 27:28.955
Kasi!

27:48.647 --> 27:50.536
It is a trap. Kill them!

28:07.706 --> 28:09.028
Dear God!

28:27.967 --> 28:29.813
How come you got this?

28:29.808 --> 28:32.932
One of your men,
sneaked into our kingdom.

28:32.932 --> 28:36.504
He tried to rescue Devasena.
We killed him.

28:37.255 --> 28:39.823
It was tied to his wrist.
l took it from him.

28:40.138 --> 28:41.668
I don't know anything else.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.950
Let me go! Let me..

28:52.631 --> 28:55.198
Bury the dead
and leave no traces.

29:31.990 --> 29:36.239
Dilip too has attained
martyrdom, chief!

29:49.368 --> 29:52.098
Don't let the drop of tear
breach your eyelids.

29:52.851 --> 29:57.023
That monster from the palace
has imprisoned our princess

29:57.015 --> 29:58.664
and has her shackled
right in the town square.

30:07.947 --> 30:11.158
Our Queen Devasena being
treated like cattle in a fair.

30:17.836 --> 30:21.801
Our pride and honour is injured
and we suffer in silence.

30:21.801 --> 30:24.924
It is not time to shed tears.

30:25.244 --> 30:27.013
It is time to breathe fire.

30:29.688 --> 30:31.938
Have you forgotten
your solemn oath?

30:32.451 --> 30:34.734
We will remember it
till our last breath.

30:34.733 --> 30:35.781
To meet our goal

30:35.974 --> 30:38.060
we will clash with thunder"
- We won't lose courage.

30:38.216 --> 30:40.347
Come hell or high water"
- We will be brave!

30:40.498 --> 30:42.420
Or death that splits us in pieces..
- We won't budge!

30:42.420 --> 30:43.950
We shall rescue Devasena!

30:47.946 --> 30:50.076
If we are to achieve our goal..

31:03.201 --> 31:05.692
"Attachments become
our weakness..."

31:06.245 --> 31:08.571
"and there is no place for
joy or celebrations."

31:08.847 --> 31:10.813
"Our body is for our lost
Motherland, Kuntala Kingdom..."

31:11.090 --> 31:12.979
"and soul exists
only to free Devasena."

31:21.059 --> 31:22.064
My leader...

31:22.500 --> 31:24.663
I heard many good things
about a warrior...

31:24.663 --> 31:26.509
called Kattappa of Mahishmati.

31:27.185 --> 31:30.429
I heard he is a good man.
Couldn't we ask him to help?

31:30.789 --> 31:32.678
Karikala Kattappa Nadaar.

31:33.552 --> 31:34.961
He is indeed a good man.

31:35.673 --> 31:38.240
He can help us if he wants to.

31:39.878 --> 31:42.609
But he won't...

31:43.482 --> 31:47.087
Kattappa is a slave
the throne of Mahishmati.

31:55.734 --> 31:56.902
Kattappa.

31:58.136 --> 32:01.228
A sword trader, Sheik Aslam Khan
from Kabul is here to see you.

32:12.631 --> 32:16.355
The ore is extracted from
the depths of Baghdad mines.

32:16.995 --> 32:19.321
Purified in the furnaces
of the Golan mountains.

32:19.758 --> 32:22.729
Crafted by the best
blacksmiths in Persia.

32:25.403 --> 32:27.414
With this in hand...

32:27.565 --> 32:30.296
even a child can slice
through ten banyan trees.

32:34.172 --> 32:35.941
I call this the Sikander.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.657
The Pride of Swords.

32:45.384 --> 32:46.913
A wonderful sword.

32:47.186 --> 32:50.911
But forgive me, Aslam,
this cannot match our speed.

32:52.711 --> 32:53.879
How insulting!

32:57.395 --> 33:02.081
Spoken words and spilled blood
can never be taken back.

33:02.961 --> 33:07.450
Duel with my sword and
prove the worth of your words.

33:35.273 --> 33:37.195
Does that prove
my point, Kattappa?

33:59.817 --> 34:01.467
I have traveled
across the world

34:01.460 --> 34:03.229
China, Persia, Mongolia, Greece.

34:03.782 --> 34:05.792
But never seen
a warrior like you.

34:06.265 --> 34:09.476
It will be an honour
to break bread with you.

34:10.148 --> 34:12.353
Please come, Kattappa.
- Please forgive me, Aslam.

34:12.750 --> 34:17.000
Slaves here do not
dine with royal guests.

34:16.995 --> 34:18.043
Slave?

34:19.317 --> 34:23.806
You are the head of the armoury,
how can you be a slave?

34:23.802 --> 34:26.445
Yes, Aslam. A slave
like you have never seen before.

34:26.603 --> 34:28.449
He forges the weapons for war.

34:28.726 --> 34:31.578
During war, he must protect
the king with his own life.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.974
After the war,
he should still lay by his feet.

34:37.094 --> 34:41.541
Tell me, what will it cost
to buy your freedom?

34:42.260 --> 34:45.623
I will pay 10, even 100 times that
to buy your freedom.

34:46.945 --> 34:49.195
You cannot put a price
on this slave, Aslam.

34:49.507 --> 34:53.320
My ancestors pledged that
everyone born in our clan...

34:53.472 --> 34:56.835
will serve the throne
of Mahishmati for life.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.926
For a pledge that
a long forgotten ancestor made

35:01.359 --> 35:01.840
you still..

35:02.000 --> 35:03.890
People who made the pledge
might be dead

35:03.882 --> 35:07.093
but their word
still lives on, Aslam.

35:07.726 --> 35:11.658
For this life, these bonds
will stay tied to this land.

35:12.130 --> 35:17.297
If loyalty has a face,
it is you, Kattappa.

35:18.776 --> 35:20.426
If you ever need anything...

35:20.698 --> 35:23.309
please don't ever forget that
you have a life-long friend.

35:47.445 --> 35:48.613
Vaishali.

35:50.689 --> 35:52.295
Where are you going?
- I will be right back.

37:35.433 --> 37:36.755
We have a golden opportunity

37:36.915 --> 37:38.564
to fulfill the oath
we have taken.

37:38.837 --> 37:41.884
They are celebrating
Bhallaladeva's birthday

37:41.880 --> 37:43.769
on the next new moon.

37:44.242 --> 37:46.689
The entire kingdom will be busy
with the celebrations.

37:49.007 --> 37:51.050
The opportunity to
free Queen Devasena...

37:51.049 --> 37:54.774
Give me the opportunity, sir!
- Chief, let me go!

37:55.374 --> 37:57.143
I offer it to Avanthika,
this time.

38:01.139 --> 38:02.504
Avanthika!

38:13.872 --> 38:15.401
What is this, Avanthika?

38:18.636 --> 38:19.958
Where did this come from?

38:21.039 --> 38:24.327
You focused on your beauty
more than your oath!

38:26.044 --> 38:30.249
You cannot put your life at stake
since you love yourself so much.

38:30.889 --> 38:33.259
You are not worthy
of this honour. Leave us.

38:44.222 --> 38:47.073
These tears are not
a reflection of my cowardice

38:48.507 --> 38:50.757
nor do they come from pain.

38:52.751 --> 38:57.043
They are a testament
to my boiling blood.

38:58.716 --> 39:01.688
If you can feel their intensity

39:03.802 --> 39:05.243
then let me go.

39:14.051 --> 39:16.542
You have to leave in two days.
So get ready.

39:16.975 --> 39:19.225
Be careful and get
the job done, Avanthika.

39:19.377 --> 39:21.508
If you get caught because
of your own neglect...

39:21.659 --> 39:24.783
Bhallaladeva will torture you
mercilessly before he kills you.

39:52.450 --> 40:00.741
"Our Mahishmati Kingdom
shall remain unconquerable."

40:01.379 --> 40:10.434
"As long as the sun, moon
and stars are shining there."

40:21.800 --> 40:28.571
"Felicity and glory
reigns supreme here."

40:30.769 --> 40:35.215
"A flourished kingdom,
happy subjects"

40:35.213 --> 40:39.626
"and the home of peace."

40:48.987 --> 40:57.998
"May the glory of Mahishmathi
soar sky high."

40:57.995 --> 41:01.720
"Our flag with the emblem
of the rising sun"

41:01.719 --> 41:05.924
"our golden throne
flanked by to stallions."

41:32.430 --> 41:34.036
Your Majesty,
it is just been two days since

41:34.032 --> 41:35.801
we caught that bull
in the forests.

41:35.793 --> 41:39.125
We haven't broken it yet.
It is quite dangerous...

41:39.117 --> 41:40.679
Minister!

41:41.359 --> 41:46.645
It would take 10 such bulls
to intimidate Bhallaladeva.

41:47.565 --> 41:48.887
Please come.

42:48.506 --> 42:49.708
Stamp it out, Bhalla!

42:53.351 --> 42:54.072
Yes!

43:00.037 --> 43:01.086
Kill him, father.

43:12.610 --> 43:14.052
Did you see, grandfather?

43:14.452 --> 43:16.178
His Majesty overpowered
the bull.

43:16.494 --> 43:18.263
Glory to the king!

43:18.256 --> 43:20.178
That was a great feat.

43:22.620 --> 43:24.030
Bravo, Your Majesty!

43:55.653 --> 43:56.778
Bhallaladeva!

44:00.417 --> 44:01.378
Father!

44:01.859 --> 44:02.984
He did it!

44:03.180 --> 44:05.191
Have you ever seen a mightier warrior!
- No, Prince!

44:12.631 --> 44:16.956
Your loyalty amuses me,
Kattappa.

44:19.637 --> 44:21.166
I know deep in your heart...

44:21.158 --> 44:23.364
you nurture this
desire to kill me.

44:25.763 --> 44:28.647
Yet you put your life
on the line to save mine.

44:29.087 --> 44:30.376
How do you do it?

44:31.369 --> 44:32.898
How do you manage to do this?

44:34.172 --> 44:36.498
Alright! You deserve it!
Ask for a reward.

44:38.576 --> 44:40.106
Ask for anything!

44:42.780 --> 44:43.785
Your Majesty!

44:44.062 --> 44:49.469
You have been holding Devasena
captive for 25 years.

44:50.948 --> 44:52.357
Please release her.

44:57.875 --> 45:00.967
So be it.
Since I have given my word.

45:01.439 --> 45:05.164
Go and kill Devasena
and release her!

45:07.965 --> 45:12.978
There is no greater liberation
than death! Go and release her!

45:15.053 --> 45:16.375
No?

45:17.895 --> 45:19.784
Then let her suffer.

45:20.898 --> 45:23.782
Not just another 25 years,
but till she dies.

45:57.776 --> 46:01.424
Hey old hag! Get up!

46:08.826 --> 46:10.071
Hey! Get up.

46:47.185 --> 46:51.990
Hey Devasena! I hope there is
nothing lacking in your torture!

46:54.992 --> 46:58.236
You chose him over me.

46:59.677 --> 47:01.763
So where is he now?

47:03.601 --> 47:06.124
Tell me the truth, Devasena.

47:06.884 --> 47:08.610
In all these years...

47:08.606 --> 47:13.095
have you ever heard
anyone even utter his name?

47:15.613 --> 47:19.186
On those long and dark night,
amid the desperate silence...

47:19.738 --> 47:22.468
and in the clunk
of your shackles...

47:22.460 --> 47:24.863
did you ever hear his name?

47:29.707 --> 47:30.712
No.

47:32.389 --> 47:35.076
Mahishmati has forgotten him,
Devasena.

47:35.473 --> 47:37.920
They neither talk
about him anymore...

47:38.356 --> 47:40.366
and nor do they remember him.

47:42.039 --> 47:44.890
There are only two people in
this kingdom that remember him.

47:45.723 --> 47:47.405
You and I.

47:48.205 --> 47:51.493
You remember him as you want
to see him before you die.

47:52.890 --> 47:55.216
And I remember him
as I want to kill him again...

47:55.212 --> 47:56.774
with my bare hands.

47:59.497 --> 48:01.703
But both our wishes
will remain unfulfilled.

49:17.054 --> 49:18.256
Lady Devasena!

49:20.458 --> 49:22.184
At least, accept it now.

49:22.700 --> 49:24.022
You just have to say yes...

49:24.021 --> 49:26.424
and I will break these shackles
and set you free.

49:28.746 --> 49:30.876
Do you want to be a prisoner
for all your life?

49:33.271 --> 49:34.593
No, Kattappa.

49:35.473 --> 49:40.158
My son will come
and he will set me free.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.482
How can your dead child
come back for you?

49:45.162 --> 49:46.691
My son is alive.

49:48.246 --> 49:50.529
He will come looking for me!

49:50.688 --> 49:52.731
You are suffering
in the name of a son...

49:52.730 --> 49:55.297
who is no longer alive,
My Lady!

49:56.694 --> 49:58.704
Please get a grip on yourself.

49:58.696 --> 50:01.940
I won't get a chance
like this once again.

50:02.780 --> 50:05.784
The guards on the night shift
will be here any moment.

50:05.783 --> 50:06.985
Please agree!

50:08.225 --> 50:09.754
Please accept it.

50:10.988 --> 50:15.160
I am begging you and you
keep doing these silly things!

50:26.203 --> 50:31.337
Do you think I am picking twigs
like a mad woman, Kattappa?

50:32.810 --> 50:34.339
This is a funeral pyre!

50:39.296 --> 50:43.349
This is for a funeral pyre
to burn to ashes...

50:43.500 --> 50:47.913
the body and the
blood of Bhallaladeva.

50:51.068 --> 50:52.597
My son will come...

50:52.750 --> 50:55.797
he will drag that animal...
and place him on this pyre.

50:56.313 --> 50:58.684
My son will make me
light the pyre...

50:58.836 --> 51:00.999
while Bhalla is still alive.

51:01.719 --> 51:04.329
The death cries of
Bhallaladeva will reverberate...

51:05.002 --> 51:08.246
beyond the walls
of Mahishmati.

51:09.407 --> 51:11.296
My son will come!

51:24.181 --> 51:25.710
What happened, Avanthika?

51:26.183 --> 51:29.187
Someone right here tattooed
my hand last night.

51:31.028 --> 51:34.119
He will come back
once he sees me.

53:15.533 --> 53:18.340
Avanthika?
What is on your shoulder?

53:27.544 --> 53:29.947
Avanthi..
- Go ahead, I will see you later!

53:29.947 --> 53:31.192
Avanthi, listen!

53:55.933 --> 53:58.336
You saw the painting on your shoulder?
Did you like it?

54:00.297 --> 54:02.668
Why that sour face?
Can you smile a little?

54:15.312 --> 54:16.360
Q" My God!

54:16.594 --> 54:18.483
Hey! What is with the arrows?

54:18.475 --> 54:20.124
You want to kill
this hunk of a man!

54:22.079 --> 54:24.963
Who are you?
- That is better.

54:24.962 --> 54:26.928
My name is Shiva.
I come from village Ambuli.

54:26.924 --> 54:28.486
I climbed this huge
mountain just for you..

54:33.651 --> 54:34.776
What a girl!

54:58.835 --> 55:03.040
See, you should listen.
Now you are in a hole.

55:06.363 --> 55:07.324
Avanthika?

55:16.293 --> 55:19.461
Now tell me who are you?
- I am telling the truth.

55:19.456 --> 55:20.865
I climbed up the mountain..
- Shut up.

55:21.538 --> 55:23.789
It is possible only for the
likes of the great Lord Shiva!

55:23.781 --> 55:25.463
That is what I am saying.
I am Shiva!

55:29.667 --> 55:32.758
I will tell you.
I will tell you everything.

55:34.711 --> 55:38.360
But before that I have
to ask you one thing. - What?

55:38.355 --> 55:42.844
Who are you? Who are you?

55:49.886 --> 55:50.814
You got a sword in your hand.

55:50.968 --> 55:54.212
Not to mention body armour, anger
sparks flying from your eyes.

55:54.892 --> 55:57.339
I am not asking about
this mask of yours!

55:57.655 --> 56:01.227
I want to know the one
that is hidden beyond it.

56:05.783 --> 56:06.831
Shall I tell you?

56:09.666 --> 56:12.593
You are a woman and I am a man.

56:15.192 --> 56:16.841
I have come here to love you.

56:54.431 --> 56:56.517
Now that hurts.

59:01.678 --> 59:02.923
This is mine.

59:04.361 --> 59:06.087
I dropped it near the waterfall.

59:08.725 --> 59:13.575
Did you really scale
the mountains to reach me?

59:15.732 --> 59:16.781
Just for me?

59:18.656 --> 59:21.627
I came all the way just to see
the smile behind the mask.

59:23.820 --> 59:25.229
I still don't see it.

59:48.726 --> 59:53.815
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

59:53.811 --> 59:59.305
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:05.904
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:10.950
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

01:00:10.948 --> 01:00:15.753
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

01:00:15.752 --> 01:00:20.166
"But now I want to live for you."

01:00:20.597 --> 01:00:25.370
"I made a pact with my heart."

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:30.492
"I will be born a hundred times
for you."

01:00:30.487 --> 01:00:35.172
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:40.946
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

01:01:01.038 --> 01:01:05.527
"I will write our love saga
on the skies."

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:10.331
"Let us be together for
the rest of our lives."

01:01:10.607 --> 01:01:20.186
"Write it with your eyes and
make my heart your canvas."

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:24.141
"Being in love is so lovely."

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:29.313
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

01:01:29.306 --> 01:01:34.156
"But now I want to live for you."

01:01:34.151 --> 01:01:43.490
"I made a pact with my heart. I will be
born a hundred times for you."

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.774
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

01:01:48.765 --> 01:01:53.691
"I am growing thirsty for love,
let there be love."

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:58.820
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:04.342
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

01:02:25.762 --> 01:02:29.334
This is something
the world has never seen.

01:02:29.486 --> 01:02:32.173
A hundred foot
tall golden statue.

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:35.059
Even the Gods don't
get this honour.

01:02:35.411 --> 01:02:37.181
Once this is erected,

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:40.218
your son,
our King Bhallaladeva's prestige...

01:02:40.376 --> 01:02:42.463
will live on forever
in the entire world.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.825
Are all the arrangements done?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

01:02:47.824 --> 01:02:49.834
There will be celebrations galore.

01:02:49.986 --> 01:02:53.558
The applause and the din
will be unprecedented, My Lord!

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:18.262
Avanthika..

01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:55.893
Frisk her!

01:04:30.206 --> 01:04:31.375
Attack!

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:30.955
Baahubali..

01:05:32.909 --> 01:05:37.474
My Lord! Forgive me, My Lord!
Please don't kill me!

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:41.439
My Lord! Forgive me, my Lord.

01:05:48.925 --> 01:05:50.247
Forgive me.

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.349
Shiva!

01:08:13.229 --> 01:08:15.556
Please forgive me, Shiva.

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:18.154
I didn't know what else to do.

01:08:19.234 --> 01:08:22.403
I cannot let go of you
nor can I abandon my duty..

01:08:22.959 --> 01:08:24.761
You are mine, Avanthika.

01:08:25.721 --> 01:08:27.732
Everything that is yours
is mine.

01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:31.696
I also share your obligation.

01:08:41.537 --> 01:08:43.819
I don't know who Devasena is.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.430
If your goal is to free her

01:08:48.665 --> 01:08:50.149
then I will bring her back!

01:08:52.108 --> 01:08:53.430
This is my word.

01:08:58.515 --> 01:09:03.048
"The pyre is lit and
I feel choked."

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:06.764
"Nevertheless there is a
yearning in my heart"

01:09:07.604 --> 01:09:16.582
"Will there be sunrise again,
ask these shackles of mine?."

01:09:16.572 --> 01:09:20.984
"0 Kingdom! see who
comes your way."

01:10:18.274 --> 01:10:21.879
Mahishmati,
you can breathe now.

01:10:22.878 --> 01:10:24.725
My son is back.

01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:27.283
Baahubali is back!

01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:46.170
When the king's statue
is erected...

01:11:46.163 --> 01:11:47.408
everyone must applaud!

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:49.485
When the king's statue
is erected

01:11:49.485 --> 01:11:50.894
everyone must applaud!

01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:35.856
No worries!

01:12:36.172 --> 01:12:38.182
It is a hundred foot statue.

01:12:38.174 --> 01:12:40.741
Won't it take a sacrifice
of a hundred heads?

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:41.765
Thank you.

01:13:52.208 --> 01:13:53.617
Baahubali..

01:13:54.891 --> 01:13:58.015
Baahubali?
- Baahubali.

01:13:58.014 --> 01:14:00.504
Baahubali!
- Baahubali!

01:14:00.496 --> 01:14:04.625
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:14:07.704 --> 01:14:10.030
Move it!
- Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:14:10.026 --> 01:14:12.636
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:19.123
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:14:19.996 --> 01:14:22.563
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:14:27.403 --> 01:14:31.215
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:14:33.529 --> 01:14:34.697
Hey!

01:14:35.331 --> 01:14:36.499
Who was that?

01:14:40.617 --> 01:14:45.750
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:17.336
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:15:20.536 --> 01:15:23.583
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:15:26.903 --> 01:15:28.825
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:51.614
Baahubali!

01:15:54.410 --> 01:16:02.908
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:16:39.255 --> 01:16:41.865
It is been fifteen days
since my son left! - Hold this.

01:16:42.058 --> 01:16:43.707
He hasn't returned yet.

01:16:43.859 --> 01:16:45.628
I wonder if he is alright.

01:16:45.781 --> 01:16:47.431
Our son carried Lord Shiva's idol
all by himself,

01:16:47.583 --> 01:16:48.392
What can happen to him?

01:16:48.624 --> 01:16:50.787
If he is alright,
why isn't he back?

01:16:50.946 --> 01:16:53.316
Maybe he found his family.

01:16:53.469 --> 01:16:55.479
He must have realized
we are his foster parents.

01:16:55.631 --> 01:16:58.318
Will he never come? Will he not
call me mother again? - Sanga.

01:16:58.514 --> 01:17:00.283
People, hurry up, will you?

01:17:13.609 --> 01:17:14.777
Come on.

01:17:22.979 --> 01:17:24.508
Earlier you saw the fire
in my eyes and

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.506
trusted me to
carry out the mission.

01:17:26.662 --> 01:17:29.666
Once again I request you
to have that belief in me.

01:17:30.426 --> 01:17:34.391
I know Shiva will rescue
Queen Devasena. Come with me.

01:17:37.072 --> 01:17:37.596
Alright!

01:17:42.317 --> 01:17:46.250
"Mahasena!"

01:17:51.047 --> 01:17:52.456
Who says that Baahubali,

01:17:52.608 --> 01:17:55.098
the one who showed us the
righteous path is no more?

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:03.860
I am nothing, but a living dead.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.945
You are dead and yet you are
alive in people's heart.

01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:17.915
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:18:19.035 --> 01:18:22.563
The echo still lingers
in these walls.

01:18:23.279 --> 01:18:28.489
It felt like it was his statue
that was being erected!

01:18:29.325 --> 01:18:31.815
Did the people express their
bottled-up feelings?

01:18:35.932 --> 01:18:38.062
Or did they see someone?

01:18:39.174 --> 01:18:40.781
No! Impossible!

01:18:42.297 --> 01:18:44.624
Let us question the soldiers on duty...

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:45.948
as to who uttered the name
and why they did so!

01:18:46.141 --> 01:18:47.146
Then the truth will come out,
grandfather.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:27.467
What are you doing here?

01:19:27.623 --> 01:19:29.392
L.. - The king has ordered us
to come. Let us go.

01:19:41.717 --> 01:19:45.168
Who first uttered the
name of Baahubali in the crowd?

01:19:49.845 --> 01:19:52.412
Am I talking to these walls?

01:19:52.608 --> 01:19:55.731
Speak! Or I will have
your tongues cut!

01:19:56.332 --> 01:20:00.144
I didn't see who, My Lord!
- Stop it!

01:20:02.177 --> 01:20:04.547
Bunch of idiots as you are!
Didn't anyone of you see him?

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.105
I saw him, My Lord!

01:20:50.906 --> 01:20:55.198
I have seen those eyes before!

01:20:56.352 --> 01:21:00.284
Bhadra! I want him alive.
- Let us go!

01:21:14.049 --> 01:21:15.611
Hey, who are you?

01:21:31.627 --> 01:21:33.156
He is here! Catch him.

01:21:43.519 --> 01:21:44.884
Catch him..

01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:09.472
That way..

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:05.604
Sound the alarm!

01:23:22.057 --> 01:23:23.542
I have come to rescue you.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.991
Kattappa, a marauder
has entered the palace

01:23:28.223 --> 01:23:29.752
and he set fire
to the King's chambers!

01:23:29.905 --> 01:23:31.347
You head north.

01:23:49.004 --> 01:23:52.008
Kattappa, Chop off his legs and hands
but I want him alive.

01:23:52.208 --> 01:23:54.774
As you say, My Prince!
- I want him alive!

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:58.658
Come on!

01:24:06.301 --> 01:24:07.590
The alarm!

01:25:14.089 --> 01:25:15.291
Attack!

01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:16.920
Get up!

01:26:19.154 --> 01:26:21.043
You lousy old hag!

01:26:23.318 --> 01:26:25.044
All these years of punishment...

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.882
for your infidelity
and still no shame!

01:26:29.324 --> 01:26:33.169
The moment you see a man,
you take off with him!

01:27:37.833 --> 01:27:40.159
Kattappa! He is going to kill me!
He is going lo kill me!

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:41.677
My Prince!

01:27:41.796 --> 01:27:44.002
It is my duty to protect you!

01:27:46.401 --> 01:27:48.804
To get to you,

01:27:51.046 --> 01:27:52.531
he has to go through me first!

01:28:57.192 --> 01:28:58.360
Kattappa!

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:00.802
Kattappa!

01:29:11.286 --> 01:29:12.411
Devasena!

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:16.531
Attack!

01:29:16.691 --> 01:29:19.138
They are going for Devasena.
Stop them.

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:20.860
Hail Mahishmati!

01:29:51.606 --> 01:29:52.852
Shiva!

01:29:58.013 --> 01:29:59.302
Siddha!

01:30:11.226 --> 01:30:14.317
"Mahasena!"

01:30:17.792 --> 01:30:20.676
"Mahasena!"

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:28.087
"Mahasena!"

01:31:24.659 --> 01:31:26.024
Anila!

01:32:08.063 --> 01:32:11.908
Baahubali!

01:33:33.348 --> 01:33:35.916
You resurrected our lost hope.

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:37.552
You made a great
warrior out of him

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:38.793
and brought him back to us.

01:33:38.954 --> 01:33:43.924
Kingdom of Mahishmati will be
eternally grateful to you.

01:34:00.896 --> 01:34:02.665
My mother looks at me

01:34:03.498 --> 01:34:05.541
with this sadness and
not the usual affection.

01:34:09.024 --> 01:34:10.586
I don't know
who they are...

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.395
and yet they look at me like
lam their God!

01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:16.953
And when I see the wounds
that tester on that lady...

01:34:17.432 --> 01:34:19.233
I have never met before,

01:34:20.835 --> 01:34:24.965
my blood boils and
my soul hurts! Why?

01:34:26.321 --> 01:34:27.523
Who am I?

01:34:28.843 --> 01:34:33.376
You are the son of our savior
Amarendra Baahubali.

01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:37.416
You are the balm
for your mother Devasena

01:34:37.612 --> 01:34:39.261
who awaited your return
for 25 years.

01:34:41.055 --> 01:34:42.661
You are the fruit of our

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:46.350
Queen Mother Sivagami's
ultimate sacrifice.

01:34:46.741 --> 01:34:50.192
The story you need to know
began 50 years ago, my son.

01:34:50.425 --> 01:34:52.588
This kingdom of Mahishmati
was established

01:34:52.747 --> 01:34:55.598
by your grandfather
Maharaja Vikramadeva.

01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:58.557
Though eider,
Bijjaiadeva was not crowned

01:34:58.673 --> 01:35:00.595
because of his conniving nature.

01:35:00.755 --> 01:35:05.802
But Bijjaiadeva blamed it only
on his physical disabilities

01:35:06.241 --> 01:35:09.212
and it caused
great turmoil in him.

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:14.013
The King died.

01:35:14.569 --> 01:35:17.540
He was survived by his subjects

01:35:17.692 --> 01:35:20.739
and the queen
who was six months pregnant.

01:35:20.895 --> 01:35:24.500
Three months passed by and
Mahishmati continued to mourn.

01:35:24.739 --> 01:35:28.070
The King's sister-in-law
and Bijjaladeva's wife, Sivagami

01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:31.708
took up the reins of the kingdom.

01:35:32.787 --> 01:35:34.196
Being an astute woman

01:35:34.308 --> 01:35:36.110
she focused on
the welfare of the people

01:35:36.271 --> 01:35:38.313
and defense
of the kingdom.

01:35:39.434 --> 01:35:42.164
She could hear
the howls of the jackals

01:35:42.316 --> 01:35:44.643
making their move
towards the throne.

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:51.050
It was a dark new moon night.
The queen was in labour.

01:35:57.853 --> 01:35:59.895
We could not save the queen,
My Lady!

01:36:04.739 --> 01:36:05.908
It is a boy!

01:36:30.324 --> 01:36:31.449
Baahubali!

01:36:37.051 --> 01:36:41.300
The empty throne reminds
me of a widow's forehead.

01:36:41.456 --> 01:36:44.580
So, I will take the throne and
restore it to its former glory!

01:36:44.699 --> 01:36:46.469
Hail him!

01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:50.546
You all swore a solemn oath
to be loyal to this throne.

01:36:50.705 --> 01:36:53.031
A revolt at a time
when the kingdom mourns

01:36:53.228 --> 01:36:55.871
goes against every tenet
of being a Kshatriya, Marthanda!

01:36:56.071 --> 01:36:57.720
Being a leader
is the first tenet

01:36:57.873 --> 01:36:59.554
of being a Kshatriya,
Minister.

01:37:09.404 --> 01:37:10.813
Lady Sivagami?

01:37:30.184 --> 01:37:34.072
All those who support this
royal family step to one side.

01:37:34.749 --> 01:37:36.999
Who will support a woman,
Sivagami?

01:37:47.682 --> 01:37:49.004
Kattappa!

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:55.894
They have soiled Mahishmati
with their revolt.

01:37:56.611 --> 01:37:58.413
Wash it off with their blood!

01:38:07.141 --> 01:38:08.431
How can you stand and watch...

01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:10.068
while our people
are being hacked to death?

01:38:12.747 --> 01:38:16.635
Move! Kill that
slave and Sivagami!

01:38:17.952 --> 01:38:19.798
Kill Kattappa!

01:38:37.451 --> 01:38:41.503
You bribed and bought my people!
How conniving!

01:38:44.659 --> 01:38:48.591
Not conniving, Marthanda.
It is called the statecraft!

01:39:03.598 --> 01:39:06.328
Lady, you are a born
statesman and a warrior

01:39:06.481 --> 01:39:07.966
and we had the privilege to witness it.

01:39:08.082 --> 01:39:11.567
Please ascend the throne
and rule Mahishmati!

01:39:11.726 --> 01:39:14.773
No, Minister.
That is not my place.

01:39:14.929 --> 01:39:18.292
Then whose is it? 0!Lady!
- What kind of a question is that, minister?

01:39:18.413 --> 01:39:22.826
It belongs to my son,
Bhallaladeva.

01:39:23.017 --> 01:39:24.382
Tell him, Sivagami!

01:39:43.838 --> 01:39:47.771
Both my sons have
a right to the throne.

01:39:48.363 --> 01:39:53.934
The one with more valour,
compassion and wisdom

01:39:54.048 --> 01:39:55.937
will be crowned
the king of Mahishmati.

01:39:57.771 --> 01:40:00.863
This is my word
and my word is the law!

01:40:05.459 --> 01:40:10.259
"You found in her
an ocean of affection."

01:40:16.831 --> 01:40:21.630
"May you live long,
my dear Baahubali."

01:40:36.771 --> 01:40:41.905
"Ambrosia and venom."

01:40:43.618 --> 01:40:50.673
"Mind is where
they both get churned."

01:41:02.437 --> 01:41:06.249
"The scion of Mahishmathi"

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:10.813
"the heir to the throne
the only one.. Baahubali."

01:41:13.848 --> 01:41:17.660
"He roars like a lion in the
battlefield." - Rest for now.

01:41:17.892 --> 01:41:21.224
"He is nothing,
but a thunderstorm."

01:41:28.262 --> 01:41:30.348
Kattappa! lam very hungry.

01:41:30.505 --> 01:41:31.914
Can I have some?

01:41:32.066 --> 01:41:33.268
My Prince!

01:41:34.028 --> 01:41:36.038
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

01:41:38.552 --> 01:41:39.842
Now give me some.

01:41:40.834 --> 01:41:43.445
My Prince!, your mere
presence here is wrong.

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:45.486
And then to sit with us
to break bread?

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.803
I am hungry.
Your lectures won't help me.

01:41:49.604 --> 01:41:50.926
There is a spread
of delicacies ready

01:41:51.085 --> 01:41:52.287
for you in your
royal chambers.

01:41:52.487 --> 01:41:54.977
I know. What is wrong
with this food?

01:41:55.129 --> 01:41:57.095
Just the aroma is
making my mouth water.

01:41:57.251 --> 01:41:59.458
You know what is wrong,
My Prince.

01:41:59.574 --> 01:42:02.500
You are royalty
and we are slaves.

01:42:02.657 --> 01:42:06.021
Alright! As the Prince
of Mahishmathi, I command you.

01:42:08.582 --> 01:42:09.750
Feed me, uncle.

01:42:43.938 --> 01:42:46.101
"Now has risen the sword
that will condemn."

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.391
"Now flies the arrow
that will pierce."

01:42:48.542 --> 01:42:50.628
"His enemies remain astonished."

01:42:50.785 --> 01:42:57.394
"They don't know where
to run or hide."

01:43:27.622 --> 01:43:28.824
Bhallaladeva!

01:43:39.874 --> 01:43:41.283
Great Bhalla!

01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:45.168
When I become the King,
you will be my commander!

01:44:07.982 --> 01:44:09.993
Both the princes
have excelled

01:44:10.144 --> 01:44:11.553
in their training as
warriors and scholars.

01:44:11.705 --> 01:44:13.431
They stand as equals.

01:44:13.667 --> 01:44:18.834
How are you going to decide who
will be crowned, Queen Mother?

01:44:20.835 --> 01:44:23.762
God has blessed both my
children with equal strengths.

01:44:23.918 --> 01:44:25.840
Now he is testing me

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:29.565
with the difficult decision
I have to make!

01:44:29.684 --> 01:44:33.289
Make their next challenges
much more difficult.

01:44:44.818 --> 01:44:47.625
Before she could decide
on who wit! ascend the throne

01:44:47.821 --> 01:44:50.672
the Queen Mother was
faced with a new crisis.

01:44:50.825 --> 01:44:53.917
the form of one
of their trusted Saketa.

01:44:56.591 --> 01:45:00.403
Saketa killed the guards
and stole our military secrets.

01:45:02.676 --> 01:45:04.959
Call for the Princes!
- As you wish.

01:45:05.559 --> 01:45:08.049
The young Princes searched

01:45:08.202 --> 01:45:10.932
for the traitor
in neighbouring kingdoms.

01:45:11.085 --> 01:45:13.488
Finally they found out
that he was hiding

01:45:13.688 --> 01:45:15.534
in a den of thieves
catted Singapuram.

01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:17.015
It is a lawless place
where bandits

01:45:17.211 --> 01:45:18.379
thieves and murderers
gathered and mingled.

01:45:18.533 --> 01:45:20.783
Strangers who drew
attention to themselves

01:45:20.935 --> 01:45:23.938
were in mortal danger.

01:45:33.187 --> 01:45:35.874
I have never seen you before.
- I just got here.

01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:38.160
A hidden dagger! What is it for?

01:45:38.352 --> 01:45:39.641
Are you a spy?

01:45:45.879 --> 01:45:48.042
If our guards were this good..

01:45:48.203 --> 01:45:49.328
We wouldn't have
had the opportunity

01:45:49.483 --> 01:45:50.925
to see so many
different Kingdoms.

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:55.053
Swords or smarts?

01:45:55.209 --> 01:45:56.651
Whichever is sharper.

01:46:04.338 --> 01:46:05.627
Do you have a drink?

01:46:12.747 --> 01:46:13.828
Big one?

01:46:22.997 --> 01:46:24.242
Much bigger?

01:46:31.565 --> 01:46:32.768
Do you have money?

01:46:41.456 --> 01:46:44.427
I need something large enough
for all my brothers!

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:05.206
Look what is happening there..

01:47:05.319 --> 01:47:06.444
Come on!

01:47:11.085 --> 01:47:14.012
Not just booze.
There is a lot more here.

01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:41.960
"Intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

01:47:42.876 --> 01:47:47.726
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

01:47:48.642 --> 01:47:54.213
"Let your lips find mine."

01:47:54.408 --> 01:47:59.902
"Come and steal
myself from me."

01:48:00.134 --> 01:48:04.426
"You are the charming one."

01:48:05.819 --> 01:48:10.473
"You are the charming one."

01:48:11.705 --> 01:48:14.436
"Your words are as
intoxicating as a bunch"

01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:17.318
"of ripe grapes
soaked in honey."

01:48:17.432 --> 01:48:22.686
"You know way to my heart,
you are the key to my soul."

01:48:23.197 --> 01:48:25.720
"Let me drink
this love potion."

01:48:25.839 --> 01:48:28.811
"You are mine, just mine."

01:48:28.963 --> 01:48:33.736
"intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:40.223
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

01:49:15.049 --> 01:49:20.500
"Take me in your strong arms,
I want to live."

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:31.947
"You got the magic,
no one has."

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:43.686
"You are something
I want to lose myself in."

01:49:43.837 --> 01:49:49.571
"I want to be your
and make you mine, too."

01:49:50.003 --> 01:49:53.531
"Come and enjoy me."

01:49:55.249 --> 01:49:59.454
"You are the charming one."

01:49:59.573 --> 01:50:00.818
"Yes, I am."

01:50:00.974 --> 01:50:05.780
"You are the charming one."

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.630
"Don't shoot me
with love daggers."

01:50:09.783 --> 01:50:12.033
"Please listen to me, my love."

01:50:12.707 --> 01:50:15.394
"Let me drink
this love potion."

01:50:15.389 --> 01:50:18.393
"You are mine, just mine."

01:50:18.392 --> 01:50:23.678
"intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

01:50:24.157 --> 01:50:29.444
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

01:51:34.628 --> 01:51:37.599
Instead of being
tortured by you, I should..

01:51:37.751 --> 01:51:38.799
Bhalla!

01:52:10.704 --> 01:52:12.473
Kattappaâ€œ

01:52:41.415 --> 01:52:44.900
Who did you sell our secrets to?
Tell me!

01:52:45.379 --> 01:52:46.821
Kalakeya!

01:52:50.544 --> 01:52:52.794
The Kalakeyas don't believe
in tactical attack.

01:52:53.347 --> 01:52:55.794
There is no limit
to their morbidity.

01:52:56.911 --> 01:52:59.073
If they barge into the kingdom

01:53:00.033 --> 01:53:02.316
they will kill every
innocent child

01:53:03.517 --> 01:53:06.488
and violate every woman.

01:53:07.642 --> 01:53:10.208
They will destroy
and burn everything.

01:53:11.285 --> 01:53:14.015
This talk might scare
some small kingdoms.

01:53:14.368 --> 01:53:16.094
We have a standing
army of 25,000 soldiers.

01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:17.535
Why should we be scared?

01:53:18.172 --> 01:53:22.104
How big is the Kalakeya army?
- One hundred thousand.

01:53:57.291 --> 01:53:59.377
When wild bulls barge into the crops

01:53:59.573 --> 01:54:04.182
and lands that the Kalakeyas
plunder, are both left barren.

01:54:12.746 --> 01:54:15.148
We have to defend our kingdom

01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:17.913
and we have to attack our
enemies at the same time.

01:54:18.392 --> 01:54:20.554
What military strategy
should we use to attack?

01:54:21.395 --> 01:54:22.716
"The trident strategy".

01:54:26.199 --> 01:54:30.688
It is one for the textbooks.
No one has ever used it.

01:54:30.884 --> 01:54:33.167
You want to go to war
with something untested?

01:54:33.326 --> 01:54:34.888
If no one has used it

01:54:35.089 --> 01:54:37.175
the Kalakeyas wouldn't
expect it either.

01:54:37.331 --> 01:54:39.460
That is why
we should implement it.

01:54:39.613 --> 01:54:42.737
I second the plan.
- I approve it.

01:54:43.817 --> 01:54:47.422
It is the only way
into our kingdom.

01:54:47.581 --> 01:54:52.715
Kattappa, how big a force
do you need to stop them?

01:54:53.226 --> 01:54:54.832
Five thousand, Your Highness!

01:54:55.509 --> 01:54:59.518
I will use armour and spears
to erect a wall of iron.

01:54:59.633 --> 01:55:02.156
I will turn it into an
impregnable fortress.

01:55:04.038 --> 01:55:06.725
I will command the forces
to the north.

01:55:09.282 --> 01:55:11.772
I will take responsibility
for the south.

01:55:13.967 --> 01:55:15.376
According to our sources,

01:55:15.529 --> 01:55:17.779
the Kalakeya chief
will stand back

01:55:17.931 --> 01:55:20.181
and send half
his army forward.

01:55:20.935 --> 01:55:23.742
Our military formation
and our weapons...

01:55:24.137 --> 01:55:27.229
will repel that kind
of attack for three hours.

01:55:27.661 --> 01:55:32.030
But we have to kill
the chief during that time.

01:55:32.186 --> 01:55:35.354
Their army,
without a chief, will scatter!

01:55:35.549 --> 01:55:37.952
In the middle of that battle

01:55:38.071 --> 01:55:40.234
both princes with
their cavalry

01:55:40.394 --> 01:55:43.124
will attack the Chief
from two sides.

01:55:43.277 --> 01:55:46.204
It will take them
at least three hours

01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:48.810
by the time they launch
a counter attack on us.

01:55:49.002 --> 01:55:51.373
That will be enough, mother.
Victory will be ours.

01:55:51.525 --> 01:55:55.097
Half that time will be enough
to behead him.

01:55:55.249 --> 01:55:58.220
Great! This will also
solve the conundrum

01:55:58.372 --> 01:56:00.415
of who should be the king.

01:56:02.576 --> 01:56:05.306
Yes! The one who kills
the Kalakeya chief

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:07.589
will ascend the
throne of Mahishmathi!

01:56:09.302 --> 01:56:11.913
My Lord has
the perfect solution. - Yes.

01:56:15.029 --> 01:56:18.437
Divide the rest of the army
equally between the Princes!

01:56:20.434 --> 01:56:22.203
Bhalla, Baahu.

01:56:22.756 --> 01:56:25.683
This is the opportunity to
pay tribute to your motherland!

01:56:26.159 --> 01:56:27.404
Accept it.

01:56:28.722 --> 01:56:31.486
Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

01:56:35.449 --> 01:56:38.300
Your uncle has
treated you unfairly.

01:56:38.452 --> 01:56:42.460
He has only given you
tools to breach a fort.

01:56:42.896 --> 01:56:45.748
Of what use will those
be in an open battlefield?

01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:48.750
The arrow-machines
and the swords' chariot,

01:56:48.902 --> 01:56:50.792
all went to Bhallaladeva!

01:56:52.826 --> 01:56:54.869
You should have objected, Baahu!

01:56:58.272 --> 01:57:00.795
Your son shall ascend
the throne of Mahishmathi.

01:57:01.275 --> 01:57:04.278
You brilliantly hoodwinked
Baahubali! - What hoodwink?

01:57:04.758 --> 01:57:08.810
If he can't even demand the
right army, the right weapons

01:57:09.643 --> 01:57:11.893
what is he going to do
on the battlefield tomorrow?

01:57:13.406 --> 01:57:15.612
I made the strong one
even stronger.

01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:19.461
It is not cheating,
it is statecraft!

01:57:20.213 --> 01:57:22.704
Hey! Who is it?
- Forgive me, My Lord!

01:57:22.855 --> 01:57:24.221
The younger Prince
asked us to pull out

01:57:24.417 --> 01:57:25.902
the tents and
bring them to him.

01:58:31.605 --> 01:58:34.696
Welcome, Bhallaladeva!

01:59:01.675 --> 01:59:07.322
Invincible!
- Invincible!

01:59:08.001 --> 01:59:10.087
Welcome, Baahubali!

01:59:14.928 --> 01:59:24.344
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:59:24.538 --> 01:59:26.548
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:59:40.634 --> 01:59:43.561
Bahu, it is
a time-honoured ritual.

01:59:43.677 --> 01:59:44.518
If you don't
sacrifice the animal

01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:46.688
the soldiers will read it as a bad omen.
- Yes, My Prince!

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.883
If you don't offer the sacrifice

01:59:49.042 --> 01:59:50.288
the Goddess will be angry.

01:59:50.443 --> 01:59:52.092
Why quench the
Goddess's thirst with

01:59:52.245 --> 01:59:53.894
the blood of
this innocent animal

01:59:54.248 --> 01:59:56.574
when my own blood
can be offered?

01:59:59.212 --> 02:00:01.659
Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

02:00:01.815 --> 02:00:05.223
Hail Mahishmathi!
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:00:05.338 --> 02:00:07.544
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:09.750
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:00:12.145 --> 02:00:13.226
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:00:20.834 --> 02:00:22.920
Mahishmathi will be
forgiving and benevolent!

02:00:25.478 --> 02:00:26.888
This is your last chance.

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:30.251
Drop your weapons and run
and we will spare your lives.

02:00:44.697 --> 02:00:46.587
I heard that you promised
both your sons that

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:49.187
the one who kills me
would be made king.

02:00:54.427 --> 02:00:57.037
And if both of them
die at my hands?

02:01:13.687 --> 02:01:16.253
I will conquer you
and your kingdom

02:01:16.409 --> 02:01:17.611
and then I will have
a son with you.

02:01:17.771 --> 02:01:19.300
You can make him the king!

02:01:27.861 --> 02:01:29.423
I want him alive.

02:01:30.423 --> 02:01:33.591
I want him to be alive
even after his arms and legs

02:01:33.747 --> 02:01:36.237
are cut off and he
lies in a pool of blood!

02:01:42.875 --> 02:01:47.528
When the vultures pluck out
his eyes and feast on his guts.

02:01:48.202 --> 02:01:50.091
He should be alive.

02:01:51.485 --> 02:01:53.254
Kattappa!
' My Lady!

02:01:53.407 --> 02:01:55.417
Blow the conch
to begin the battle.

02:02:25.358 --> 02:02:26.560
It is ready.

02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:27.604
Arm the weapon.

02:02:33.166 --> 02:02:34.334
Fire!

02:02:40.013 --> 02:02:41.498
Baahubali's command'.!

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.005
Get ready!

02:03:10.323 --> 02:03:12.092
Arm the weapons.

02:04:16.389 --> 02:04:17.470
Attack!

02:05:14.046 --> 02:05:16.089
Attack!

02:06:52.745 --> 02:06:55.432
Well done, Baahubali!
- Well done.

02:07:23.696 --> 02:07:25.586
Soldiers. Attack.

02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:27.224
Attack!

02:07:45.638 --> 02:07:48.161
Hold! Hold strong!

02:08:03.656 --> 02:08:05.426
Swords group, step forward!

02:10:04.617 --> 02:10:06.747
Trident strategy begins!

02:12:29.922 --> 02:12:31.211
Stop-

02:12:37.130 --> 02:12:38.298
Bhallaladeva!

02:12:43.816 --> 02:12:45.018
My Prince?

02:12:55.948 --> 02:12:57.794
My Prince!
- Army!

02:14:26.038 --> 02:14:28.922
Hold your lines!

02:14:36.409 --> 02:14:39.139
Hold your lines! Hold them!

02:15:21.414 --> 02:15:23.303
Our defenses are in tatters.

02:15:23.695 --> 02:15:25.782
We are seeing an enemy
flag on Mahishmati soil...

02:15:25.938 --> 02:15:26.899
for the first time!

02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:29.385
This is the death of us. Death!

02:15:29.942 --> 02:15:32.465
Death! Death!

02:16:20.913 --> 02:16:22.114
Death!

02:16:25.237 --> 02:16:26.646
Death!

02:16:29.922 --> 02:16:31.244
Soldiers!

02:16:38.811 --> 02:16:40.296
What is death?

02:16:41.895 --> 02:16:44.145
To think that the
enemy is stronger

02:16:44.296 --> 02:16:45.858
than our resolve, is death!

02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:51.865
Cowardice on the battlefield
is death!

02:16:53.706 --> 02:16:57.998
The cruel man insulted our
mother and he is still alive.

02:16:59.791 --> 02:17:02.795
Instead of presenting his
decapitated head at her feet

02:17:02.955 --> 02:17:05.205
we are turning our backs
to him and that is death!

02:17:10.002 --> 02:17:12.974
I will ride on to annihilate
that death!

02:17:14.046 --> 02:17:17.977
No rogue can ever harm
my mother or my motherland.

02:17:18.209 --> 02:17:22.218
I am about to rip them apart
and proclaim my war cry!

02:17:27.419 --> 02:17:29.430
Who is with me?

02:17:31.383 --> 02:17:32.673
Me!

02:17:32.825 --> 02:17:35.556
Who will die with me?
- Me!

02:17:35.788 --> 02:17:40.353
Who will vanquish that
death and live on? - Me!

02:17:41.994 --> 02:17:43.239
Me!

02:17:43.396 --> 02:17:47.764
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:52.004
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:18:02.174 --> 02:18:03.736
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:18:05.257 --> 02:18:08.620
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:18:34.046 --> 02:18:35.215
Sethupathy!

02:23:15.567 --> 02:23:17.730
I want him alive when
the vultures pluck out his eyes

02:23:17.890 --> 02:23:20.292
and feast on his guts.

02:23:21.093 --> 02:23:25.582
His limbs are to be cut off
and his blood should flow!

02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:50.285
My Son!

02:23:51.883 --> 02:23:54.767
Bhallaladeva! Bhallaladeva!

02:24:16.948 --> 02:24:18.271
My Son!

02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:25.086
My brave son killed
Kalakeya and won the battle!

02:24:30.162 --> 02:24:34.007
To the future king,
Bhallaladeva!

02:24:34.165 --> 02:24:37.333
Hail Bhallaladeva!
Hail Bhallaladeva!

02:24:38.811 --> 02:24:41.061
Bhallaladeva's valour
will be told in Mahishmati

02:24:41.213 --> 02:24:43.223
for generations to come!

02:24:43.815 --> 02:24:49.222
Tales of his victory will be
etched on shrines and temples.

02:24:49.741 --> 02:24:51.991
Today, I proclaim
my son Bhallaladeva

02:24:52.144 --> 02:24:55.354
as the commander of the
armed forces of Mahishmathi!

02:24:58.630 --> 02:25:02.442
I proclaim Baahubali
as the King of Mahishmathi!

02:25:10.763 --> 02:25:13.931
Sivagami,
What sort of a decision is this?

02:25:14.086 --> 02:25:18.859
My son, our son,
killed the Kalakeya chief!

02:25:19.011 --> 02:25:21.217
You saw it with your own eyes!

02:25:22.054 --> 02:25:25.418
He has to be the King! Only he!

02:25:25.897 --> 02:25:28.104
The merits of a King
are evaluated not

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:29.985
by the number
of enemies he has killed

02:25:30.142 --> 02:25:32.545
but by the number of
his own people he has saved.

02:25:33.064 --> 02:25:33.992
During the battle

02:25:34.146 --> 02:25:36.996
Bhallaladeva's focus was
only in vanquishing the enemy.

02:25:37.188 --> 02:25:40.072
Baahubali,
while killing the enemy

02:25:40.271 --> 02:25:42.642
also managed
to save his subjects.

02:25:43.596 --> 02:25:46.359
That is the difference
between a soldier and a king.

02:25:48.521 --> 02:25:51.884
If you kill a hundred men you will
be called a great warrior.

02:25:52.484 --> 02:25:56.688
But if you save one life,
you will be called God!

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.813
So, saving a couple
of common men

02:26:01.974 --> 02:26:03.383
is now the
qualification to rule?

02:26:03.495 --> 02:26:05.778
Baahubali will be
crowned the King of

02:26:05.938 --> 02:26:07.947
Mahishmati on
an auspicious day.

02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:12.271
That is my word
and my word is law!

02:26:16.388 --> 02:26:18.714
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:23.924
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:26:24.115 --> 02:26:26.004
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:26:26.158 --> 02:26:30.287
Baahubali!
- Baahubali!

02:26:30.441 --> 02:26:35.608
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:26:45.737 --> 02:26:47.900
Amarendra Baahubali!

02:26:49.021 --> 02:26:52.472
Glory to him!

02:26:55.947 --> 02:26:59.071
Amarendra Baahubali!

02:26:59.631 --> 02:27:03.279
Glory to him!

02:27:03.475 --> 02:27:06.479
Glory to him!

02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:11.564
My Shiva is the son
of such a great king!

02:27:12.644 --> 02:27:15.211
We are so glad
to hear about him.

02:27:16.128 --> 02:27:19.252
I wish we can
see the great man once!

02:27:21.652 --> 02:27:23.062
He is no more.

02:27:24.655 --> 02:27:26.425
The saviour is no more!

02:27:33.385 --> 02:27:35.548
You said no enemy
could come near him.

02:27:36.027 --> 02:27:38.158
You said the weapons
were afraid to touch him?

02:27:39.671 --> 02:27:41.681
How did such
a great warrior die?

02:27:43.515 --> 02:27:46.879
More grievous than
the wound of a sword or a spear

02:27:47.759 --> 02:27:49.440
is a stab in the back, Mahendra.

02:27:49.882 --> 02:27:52.448
Who? Who was it?

02:27:55.606 --> 02:27:56.896
That traitor...

02:27:59.051 --> 02:28:00.219
was me!

02:28:16.748 --> 02:28:21.548
"Golden dreams
and great heartache."

02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:34.801
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river called life."

02:28:41.093 --> 02:28:50.628
"When great mountains
lay in its path."

02:28:52.344 --> 02:28:57.144
"It cuts deep gorges through
the rock to keep flowing!"

02:29:04.355 --> 02:29:09.155
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life."

02:29:21.612 --> 02:29:27.860
"It is called
the river of life."
