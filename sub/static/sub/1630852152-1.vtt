00:23.607 --> 00:26.777
<i>Cannabis</i> <i>was</i> <i>one</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>first
plants</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>cultivated</i> <i>by</i> <i>man,</i>

00:28.738 --> 00:30.448
<i>and</i> <i>it</i> <i>didn't</i> <i>take</i> <i>long</i> <i>to
discover</i> <i>that</i> <i>this</i> <i>simple</i> <i>leaf</i>

00:32.074 --> 00:36.203
<i>would be the door we needed
to understand who we really are.</i>

00:37.496 --> 00:40.624
<i>It's a window
into the duality of our lives,</i>

00:42.168 --> 00:44.003
<i>into the duality of our souls.</i>

00:45.880 --> 00:50.134
<i>Behind</i> <i>this</i> <i>simple</i> <i>leaf</i> <i>there's</i> <i>an
opportunity</i> <i>to</i> <i>build</i> <i>something...</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:55.347
<i>but, at the same time,</i>

00:56.348 --> 00:58.851
<i>a secret to destroy.</i>

01:02.146 --> 01:03.147
<i>The question is:</i>

01:04.523 --> 01:06.776
<i>Which of these paths
do you want to go down?</i>

01:13.282 --> 01:14.950
And the answer to this...

01:16.660 --> 01:18.704
is hidden in each of our souls.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.708
Within you, Felix.

01:23.959 --> 01:24.877
Within you, Ignacio.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.714
And within you, Mariana.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.185
Here's the cash.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.187
The cash can wait.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.821
You're not buying the seeds
before trying them.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.367
Who's going first?

02:14.176 --> 02:16.136
<i>Felix! Felix, wake up.</i>

02:16.178 --> 02:17.763
Fuck, wake up, Felix!

02:17.805 --> 02:19.473
- Where are we?
- We're in deep shit.

02:19.515 --> 02:20.599
Let's go!

02:21.308 --> 02:23.727
Felix! Felix! Felix!

03:24.955 --> 03:29.877
SIX MONTHS LATER

04:19.009 --> 04:19.551
This is paradise.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.471
And you haven't even
tried it yet.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.098
Smell them.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.980
That bittersweet pine
and lemon smell is unique.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.945
I'm gonna tell you something.

04:37.987 --> 04:40.906
This weed is off the charts.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.379
So, what happened to your lip?

04:55.421 --> 04:58.382
You don't know my name
and you're worried about my lip?

04:58.424 --> 05:00.718
Let's just say I feel empathy
towards strangers.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.972
So, we shouldn't get
to know each other yet.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.977
I'm not sure about that yet.

05:11.437 --> 05:12.646
Let's see if this helps.

05:18.402 --> 05:21.822
Slowly. Inhale slowly.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.950
Let the fresh air in.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.746
And then let it out slowly.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.839
Where has this been all my life?

05:40.799 --> 05:42.426
Where did you find this?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.304
From a place that's gone now.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.310
I know someone who would
buy all of it.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.689
This is sacred for me.
It's not for sale.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.109
We're talking about a
lot of money.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.279
Are we really here to
talk business?

06:58.794 --> 07:01.505
BLACK SHEEP IN COLOMBIA'S
MOST POWERFUL FAMILY

07:03.966 --> 07:06.927
ANOTHER FAILED VENTURE?

07:08.512 --> 07:10.889
IGNACIO SANTAMARÍA'S
FAILED VENTURES

07:12.349 --> 07:14.101
ONE FAILURE AFTER ANOTHER

07:14.143 --> 07:16.854
<i>This article was just
supposed to be a profile.</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:21.483
No, no one told me
every employee was gonna line up

07:21.525 --> 07:22.818
to shit in a bucket
and then throw it in my face.

07:24.736 --> 07:29.032
Listen, kid. Why don't you ask a
responsible adult to come to the phone?

07:29.074 --> 07:31.827
I wanna talk to the brothel's owner,
not the whores.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.582
That's because
he's not answering his phone!

07:38.959 --> 07:39.751
Oh, you would you do
that for me?

07:41.211 --> 07:44.381
If that's the case,
I owe you an apology, honestly,

07:44.423 --> 07:47.426
'cause until a minute ago, I
thought I was talking to an idiot.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.636
But things have changed.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.973
Why don't we try something?
Come to my apartment tonight.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.559
We'll have some wine,
and you can say that again

07:55.601 --> 07:58.270
but whispering it in my ear, to
see if it gives me an erection.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.190
No, there's nothing to explain.

08:01.231 --> 08:04.359
I understand perfectly well. You're
an opportunistic propaganda tabloid

08:04.401 --> 08:06.862
that only exists to paint
the upper class

08:06.904 --> 08:09.072
as an object of admiration,
but when sales...

08:09.114 --> 08:11.742
Let me finish. I don't like interruptions
when I'm insulting someone!

08:13.035 --> 08:15.954
When sales are low,
which is always the case,

08:15.996 --> 08:20.000
you never hesitate
to stick a knife in whoever,

08:20.042 --> 08:22.711
remove their guts
and then throw them in the ring

08:22.753 --> 08:25.839
for the masses to suck up the
blood and make sausages out of it.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.133
Am I right or not?

08:30.928 --> 08:31.762
Hello?

08:33.847 --> 08:34.890
Hello?

08:36.225 --> 08:37.684
Are you gonna stay quiet?

08:39.061 --> 08:41.313
At least have the balls
to hang up on me.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.066
Sure.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.820
Yeah, kid, I'm still here.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.448
Your fucking opinion
is very important to me.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.167
As everybody at this
table knows,

09:02.209 --> 09:06.088
the company has seen a seven
percent decline in sales.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.591
Is the presentation today?

09:10.342 --> 09:11.551
Today's the day.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.316
Come, we have pending business.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.695
What's that?

09:30.946 --> 09:32.572
We're ovulating, right?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.827
"We" is a lot of people.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.798
I need to stay focused now.
I can't.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.842
But this will help you focus.

09:51.883 --> 09:52.884
Come on!

09:54.761 --> 09:58.765
Please. Tonight. When
I'm relaxed.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.060
I like doing it when I'm
relaxed. Not now.

10:07.566 --> 10:08.859
You'll do just fine...

10:11.737 --> 10:14.614
Mmm, come again?

10:31.757 --> 10:34.551
The company has seen
a seven percent decline

10:34.593 --> 10:36.511
in sales so far this year.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.599
It's clear that we need
to change direction

10:40.640 --> 10:43.310
to reposition our brand
on the international stage.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.354
These are new times.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.274
And in new times, we need to react
with modern concepts.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.777
There's nothing new
in these times, my God.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.075
Well, we obviously disagree
in that regard,

10:58.116 --> 11:00.744
but I'm not here today
to talk semantics.

11:00.786 --> 11:04.289
I want to present to you
my way of positioning Rosalía

11:04.331 --> 11:06.583
as a driving force for change
in business management,

11:07.501 --> 11:09.544
starting with sustainability.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.756
Sustainability must be
a pillar of our company.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.176
In the documents you'll find in
your folders, please,

11:17.969 --> 11:22.432
there's a breakdown of the
reengineering necessary to turn Rosalía

11:22.474 --> 11:26.144
into the first green floriculture
company in Colombia.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.486
But, well, there's no use
in transforming a company

11:35.612 --> 11:37.531
if we don't transform
our product too.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.074
Do we all agree?

11:47.874 --> 11:48.959
I don't get it.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.587
Well, this is about more
than packaging.

11:54.005 --> 11:57.217
This is the result of months
of studies and designs

11:57.259 --> 12:00.053
to ensure our product
becomes not only a product,

12:00.720 --> 12:01.888
but an experience.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.352
- Packaging?
- It represents an evolution in language...

12:07.394 --> 12:09.896
Mariana, we sell flowers.

12:11.273 --> 12:14.234
You can't see the flowers.
Where are the flowers?

12:14.276 --> 12:15.068
People know our flowers.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.863
They're familiar with our product.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.575
What we're doing now is presenting
them in a different way.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.410
A way never seen before.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.954
We have to be ambitious.

12:25.996 --> 12:29.499
This company could be
among the top in the world.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.419
When I see that,
I don't see a flower company.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.003
I see a packaging company.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.591
How much does the cardboard
cost, each one of those cones?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.093
Eighty cents.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.595
Our bags cost three.

12:41.636 --> 12:42.888
People don't want bags anymore.

12:44.473 --> 12:49.352
People are prepared to invest
in a more expensive product

12:49.394 --> 12:52.481
as long as it's respectful
and friendly to the environment.

12:52.522 --> 12:56.651
The environment is a concept the
hippies invented to smoke marijuana.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.282
My mom believed in it
and she wasn't a hippie.

13:02.324 --> 13:06.328
Don't bring your mom into this,
she's not here to defend herself.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.419
What happened with the party
we asked you to organize?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.755
Why don't you focus on that,

13:16.796 --> 13:20.217
on what we know you're good at,
instead of this shit?

13:20.258 --> 13:22.677
Why don't you ask one of them
to organize the party?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.472
Mariana, let's be respectful.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.807
Respectful? This is
my company too.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.357
Can you give us a minute,
please?

13:37.526 --> 13:38.652
Thank you.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.420
I've been at this
company for 43 years,

13:58.797 --> 14:03.385
from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Monday to Saturday.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.928
- My objectives also...
- And yes.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.724
Your mom's family founded
this company, it's true.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.062
And yes, they left some crops
in your name, it's true.

14:15.939 --> 14:19.234
But you have no right to throw it
in my face in front of the board,

14:19.276 --> 14:22.195
which has been here longer
than you've stood on this Earth.

14:23.572 --> 14:27.075
I'm not here to throw anything
in your face, Dad.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.537
I'm here to present my vision,
humbly.

14:32.414 --> 14:36.084
And you were told "no," humbly,
but you made a scene.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.255
I can offer more than
that damn party.

14:42.090 --> 14:46.553
I used to say that when I had to cut
flowers with the sun on my back.

14:48.013 --> 14:53.310
Then I learned, I understood,
that things take time.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.275
If you want to keep working
at this company,

15:00.317 --> 15:02.485
you're going to organize
that damn party.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.489
Whether you like it or not.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.350
What's going on here?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.560
I'm making you breakfast.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.979
I'm allergic to eggs.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.190
Seriously? Since when?

15:41.191 --> 15:42.776
Since a long time
before you left.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.279
- Where's Cristina?
- She said she'll be late.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.448
So, no breakfast?

15:48.490 --> 15:51.993
I haven't had breakfast for
years. Are you coming with me?

15:52.035 --> 15:53.536
Wasn't the appointment in
the afternoon?

15:53.578 --> 15:55.622
No, it's in a half hour
and the taxi's here.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.084
Shit.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.891
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.184
Hello, sir.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.853
Oh, please, put those
on that table over there.

16:19.354 --> 16:20.188
Thanks.

16:24.693 --> 16:25.985
Nana!

16:26.027 --> 16:30.532
Ignacio! Oh, dear,
what a surprise to see you here!

16:31.449 --> 16:34.327
Well, I'm here to... to see you.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.329
Oh, cut the crap.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.665
You know that I don't fall
for such silly things.

16:38.707 --> 16:39.958
How's everything at home?

16:39.999 --> 16:42.127
Don't make me talk
about tragedies right now.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.378
You don't say. Are
things that bad?

16:44.587 --> 16:47.048
Honey, this country is
going to the dogs.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.760
The rich just think everything's great
'cause they can go to their country house.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.472
Are we having burgers for
lunch this week?

16:54.514 --> 16:55.390
Of course.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.059
Is the whole family here yet?

16:58.101 --> 17:00.645
Everyone. Even the ex-president.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.647
Go say hello.
They'll be happy to see you.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.358
No, you cut the crap too.
I won't fall for it either.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.406
Family.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.326
What's up?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.746
Oh, you came. Good.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.623
Yes. How could I miss this
marvelous and entertaining lunch?

17:22.083 --> 17:24.502
Right. Hey, I saw you in one
of those magazines again.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.545
Congratulations.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.507
The article was a shame though. Those
bastards didn't treat you right.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.634
Yeah. It's the price of fame.
You wouldn't get it.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.053
But don't worry about me.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.181
I'm already thinking
about a new business idea.

17:36.222 --> 17:39.309
I'm glad. In fact,
let's share it with the family.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.435
Don't be an asshole.

17:40.477 --> 17:41.519
I want to share something.
Great news.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.774
Nachito is going to start
a new business,

17:45.815 --> 17:47.442
and I'm happy about it,
of course.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.527
What is it this time?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.905
I suppose you'll
manage a brothel.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.992
If so, I can already imagine
the headlines.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.536
"Ex-president's grandson involved
with whores." Beautiful.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.038
Enough, Felipe.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.540
Don't use your grandpa for your jokes.
Come on. Enough.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.875
- Yeah, no, don't worry.
- So?

18:05.335 --> 18:10.131
Buddy, come on! I'm just joking.
Don't get mad. Come on.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.426
Is this business for
real or what?

18:13.468 --> 18:16.846
Yeah, it has to be. We don't all
suck on the government's tit.

18:22.727 --> 18:23.978
- Well...
- How are you?

18:24.020 --> 18:24.979
Hello, dear.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.815
- How are you?
- How's it going?

18:26.856 --> 18:28.566
Well, I'm terrified.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.569
This country
definitely went mad.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.112
Even more? What happened?

18:33.154 --> 18:34.739
It seems like they're going
to legalize marijuana.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.615
No, they're not going
to legalize it.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.870
- They're gonna approve legal farming.
- Same thing.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.539
If they farm it,
someone will smoke it. Anyway.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.000
We'll have more addicts
and criminals out there.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.210
How's the bill progressing?

18:47.252 --> 18:48.711
We're voting on it this week.

18:49.504 --> 18:50.505
But surely it won't pass.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.676
A couple of Canadian companies
are lobbying for it,

18:54.717 --> 18:56.427
throwing a lot of money at it.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.471
- That changes everything.
- That's terrible.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.850
Don't worry, Auntie.
It's for medicinal use.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.560
Medicinal? Yeah, right.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.521
Yes, a lot of people depend on
it for their medical treatments.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.147
We have to change the paradigm,
right?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.108
No, Ignacio, don't tell
me that nonsense.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.902
They'll start finding loopholes and
it'll end up like your aunt says.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.737
Oh, no, but you can't let
that happen. No.

19:16.364 --> 19:19.909
- If it's signed, when would it become law?
- A couple weeks.

19:19.951 --> 19:24.163
A few companies are already
coming up with proposals for it.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.248
The table is ready.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.541
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.014
I'm going on a trip to Italy
in six months.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.516
What do you mean?
Didn't you hear him?

19:44.309 --> 19:45.435
Of course I did.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.396
I have cancer, I'm not deaf.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.151
I need to know how it all works
so I can organize myself.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.862
Carmencita booked all the
hotels already.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.822
Is it wrong of me to ask?

19:57.864 --> 20:01.618
This right here is a little more
important than your trip to Italy, Mom.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.038
That's for me to decide,
isn't it?

20:07.957 --> 20:12.420
The procedure depends on each patient
and how advanced the disease is.

20:12.462 --> 20:16.674
You just said we found it in
time, that there are no issues.

20:18.301 --> 20:21.262
What are you doing?
We have more questions.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.181
If you want to ask, go ahead.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.309
I need to be at the hairdresser's
and, luckily, I can go alone.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.020
Fernando, thank you very much.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.939
I'll arrange my appointments
with the secretary.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.650
Give Rosarito a hug for me.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.237
Fuck, my mom's crazy.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.950
It quite a common reaction.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.079
So? What are we going to do?

20:46.996 --> 20:48.081
That's the other thing.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.626
Your mom's health policy
has been suspended.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.002
Suspended, how?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.713
Yes, she's behind on payments.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.842
I'll talk to our lawyer
to see what can be done.

20:59.884 --> 21:00.927
Well, that's fine by me,

21:02.261 --> 21:05.431
but the thing is,
all of the chemotherapy supplies

21:05.473 --> 21:07.183
come from the hospital,

21:07.225 --> 21:10.144
and if they're not paid
what they're owed,

21:10.186 --> 21:14.107
they won't authorize a single session
of chemotherapy for your mom.

21:14.148 --> 21:14.691
How can they do that?

21:16.025 --> 21:19.028
- We're doing what we can.
- So? You'll let her die?

21:20.822 --> 21:23.157
Look, I'm just the middleman,
Felix.

21:23.199 --> 21:23.783
The messenger.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.827
My hands are tied.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.556
Oh, God!

21:48.099 --> 21:50.226
Why didn't you remind
me this morning?

21:52.979 --> 21:58.776
Only you could be surprised
by an anniversary celebration.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.947
- Happy anniversary, love.
- Happy anniversary.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.412
Did you bring any food?

22:11.456 --> 22:12.081
No.

22:13.458 --> 22:16.961
These are things from the
tasting for the office party,

22:17.003 --> 22:19.881
but I haven't had the stomach
to try any of it.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.717
I know today was difficult.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.511
I'm sorry about what happened.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.515
But something's gonna
change soon.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.103
Cheers.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.397
Cheers.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.987
Can I help with anything? Can--

22:43.029 --> 22:44.447
No, don't worry. Stay here.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.865
The food's in the oven.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.075
Thank you.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.078
We have something else
to celebrate.

22:50.995 --> 22:51.829
Oh, yeah?

22:52.455 --> 22:53.081
What's that?

22:53.748 --> 22:55.750
Sergio called me at the
office today.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.170
I thought we were gonna talk
about the budget,

22:59.212 --> 23:02.131
but it turns out there was
a problem with Samantha,

23:03.132 --> 23:04.592
and I was offered the promotion.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.054
I'm the new vice president
for Latin America.

23:08.930 --> 23:09.931
What happened with Samantha?

23:10.681 --> 23:12.892
You said she was
the best person for the job.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.271
Why does it matter
what happened with her?

23:17.313 --> 23:18.773
Did you hear what I said?

23:21.025 --> 23:23.611
You're completely right.

23:23.653 --> 23:24.612
Forgive me.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.491
I'm all over the place.
Congratulations.

23:28.533 --> 23:31.410
That's great. I know you've worked
really hard for this.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.704
I know you've put a lot into it.

23:34.956 --> 23:38.960
This is a huge step
for our family, Mariana.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.214
Yes.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.820
What's up?

24:05.862 --> 24:09.365
<i>Hey, I'm just calling you back.
I was in a meeting. What's up?</i>

24:09.407 --> 24:13.077
All good. Just called to say hi
and ask about your hemorrhoids.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.120
So considerate. Thanks.

24:15.037 --> 24:17.707
I thought you were calling about
the article in that magazine.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.584
Which magazine? No idea what
you're talking about.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.003
<i>Because if I were you,</i>

24:22.044 --> 24:25.381
I'd look for a way for the owner of
the website with the most views--

24:25.423 --> 24:27.967
Second most views.
Get off your high horse.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.260
Okay, second most views.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.388
To help me with a piece
to improve my image.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.432
But I'm not falling
into that trap.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.057
There is no trap.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.977
I don't like being given
things for free.

24:38.019 --> 24:41.063
That's why I'm calling.
I want to do things properly.

24:42.023 --> 24:42.773
Look, I have a proposal.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.903
Let's do a profile on me. I won't
ask you to paint me as a saint.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.281
<i>Criticize me all you want,
turn me into shit if you want,</i>

24:52.366 --> 24:55.411
<i>but</i> <i>people</i> <i>will</i> <i>at</i> <i>least</i> <i>understand
failure</i> <i>is</i> <i>a</i> <i>part</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>process.</i>

24:55.453 --> 24:57.622
Do you have a new business idea,
or what?

24:58.873 --> 25:01.000
<i>Yeah. That's what I'm up to.
Analyzing.</i>

25:01.042 --> 25:02.793
<i>There are lots of
options on the table,</i>

25:02.835 --> 25:05.338
but I want something big this time.
I'll knock it out of the park.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.925
<i>Well, let me think
about the profile,</i>

25:08.966 --> 25:11.385
but if we do it, we'll do
it properly and honestly.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.470
You know me.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.847
<i>I wouldn't want it
any other way.</i>

25:14.889 --> 25:16.557
Think about the profile
and let me know.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.684
All right, then. Smooches.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.124
Did you send for me,
Your Majesty?

25:43.793 --> 25:47.255
Yes. How's that thing with the
smuggler businessman going?

25:47.296 --> 25:48.714
Magnificently well.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.466
You've been saying
that for months.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.219
Rome wasn't built in a day.

25:53.261 --> 25:56.138
Rome? With your intel,
you couldn't even build Bogotá.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.181
This case is over.

25:58.307 --> 26:02.436
I told you he lied in his interview.
We've gotta find out what he's hiding.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.021
Lola, everyone lies.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.399
Look at me. I told the team
you'd get results in two months

26:06.440 --> 26:08.109
and, what happened? Nothing.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.277
The question is why did he lie.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.614
Even the smallest of lies
always hides bigger shit.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.574
And, Your Majesty,
what was hiding behind this shit

26:15.616 --> 26:16.659
when I assigned you the case?

26:17.702 --> 26:18.828
That you wanted to
sleep with me.

26:20.162 --> 26:23.082
Lola, I've never tried
anything sexual with you.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.751
Wanting to help you
means I wanted to fuck you?

26:25.793 --> 26:28.838
Obviously. Men only offer help
in order to fuck.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.798
It's not quantum
mechanics.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.176
I'm trying to be a great boss,
a good guy, a good friend.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.929
So I am going to assign you
a case worthy of such greatness.

26:36.971 --> 26:38.306
Is that so?

26:38.347 --> 26:40.474
You're going to do a profile
on Ignacio Santamaría.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.853
You're taking me off a serious job to
write a profile on your friend?

26:44.812 --> 26:46.814
I couldn't have said it better.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.316
You're screwing with me.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.484
Didn't you say men only
want to screw?

26:50.526 --> 26:51.694
It's not quantum mechanics.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.029
- I said "fuck".
- Same shit.

26:54.697 --> 26:58.159
I want the article in the next issue,
so, please. Thank you.

27:01.829 --> 27:05.374
The situation is much more
complicated than I thought.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.917
What do you mean?

27:06.959 --> 27:08.085
You and your mom
won't get a single peso

27:08.127 --> 27:10.087
from your dad's company.

27:10.129 --> 27:14.050
You told me the will said his assets
would be split between the two of us.

27:14.091 --> 27:18.679
Yes, but your dad couldn't leave you
anything that didn't belong to him.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.306
How come? It was his company.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.975
We've talked about this.
It's more complex than that.

27:23.017 --> 27:26.354
We've been fighting for a year
and we won't get anything?

27:26.395 --> 27:28.689
We can keep on fighting,
of course, but it'll cost.

27:28.731 --> 27:30.941
I think it's best to
leave things as is.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.694
Your dad's partners won.
They took almost everything.

27:33.736 --> 27:36.572
Almost? We don't have a
fucking peso!

27:36.614 --> 27:38.949
I know, but it could
have been worse.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.618
Remember, they also wanted
to take your mom's house.

27:42.370 --> 27:45.039
To think that those assholes were
supposed to be my dad's friends.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.208
The most dangerous partnerships
are those involving friends,

27:48.459 --> 27:50.878
because they know what
hurts you the most.

27:56.592 --> 28:00.346
IGNACIO SANTAMARÍA
10 MISSED CALLS

29:07.288 --> 29:09.623
Which part of "never see each other
again" didn't you understand?

29:10.374 --> 29:11.208
Calm down, sweet cheeks.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.587
That was before, when
we were scared.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.672
But nothing happened.
We're free.

29:16.714 --> 29:19.258
We're free for now,
but we're not out of the woods.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.676
Look, pal, things have changed.

29:21.886 --> 29:24.346
- I have a business proposal.
- A proposal?

29:25.139 --> 29:26.182
Are you stupid or what?

29:26.223 --> 29:27.808
Listen, you might be interested.

29:27.850 --> 29:30.144
The government's about to open
opportunities to grow cannabis.

29:30.186 --> 29:31.020
I'm not interested.

29:32.146 --> 29:33.814
Why not? It's what you
always wanted.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.734
Don't come looking
for me again, Santamaría.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.777
Did you forget you're the one
who got me into this?

29:40.154 --> 29:42.907
That you called me to get me
into this business?

29:44.283 --> 29:45.951
No one knows what happened.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.162
I don't care,
I don't want any more trouble.

29:49.246 --> 29:49.914
Sure.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.875
As always.
You'll just run away, huh?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.258
I can't talk. Lucas is here.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.927
No, Lucas left. I saw him.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.386
I have to organize some things.

30:04.428 --> 30:06.013
I won't take much of your time.

30:16.232 --> 30:19.193
Look, the government's signing
a new law this week

30:19.235 --> 30:21.820
to regulate the legal
farming of cannabis,

30:21.862 --> 30:24.073
but there'll only be five spots.

30:24.114 --> 30:25.241
I want us to join
forces to get one.

30:27.284 --> 30:30.621
I know I don't have to convince you.
We talked about this six months ago,

30:30.663 --> 30:33.791
when we were going to buy seeds, and
you were very much in agreement.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.835
I've never talked
about buying seeds with you.

30:39.255 --> 30:40.422
Okay.

30:41.799 --> 30:44.593
We never did any studies
on what might happen

30:44.635 --> 30:46.887
if cannabis farming
were legalized in Colombia.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.973
You never said this was
the business of the future,

30:49.014 --> 30:51.183
and you definitely didn't tell me
how we could do it

30:51.225 --> 30:52.810
and start it in a place where
it's never been done before.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.812
And none of that happened
at a beach in Tayrona.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.064
Okay. I can live with that.

30:58.899 --> 31:02.111
I'm not here to talk about the past,
I came to talk about the future,

31:02.152 --> 31:03.821
because the part that never
happened, that I'm making up,

31:03.862 --> 31:05.531
because I'm cuckoo,

31:05.573 --> 31:08.826
still remembers a Mariana who wanted
to conquer the fucking world.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.327
And, you're right.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.745
None of that happened,
it's all gone with the wind.

31:13.289 --> 31:17.001
But it's here, right now,
that I want to ask this Mariana

31:17.042 --> 31:20.588
if she still wants
to conquer the fucking world.

31:20.629 --> 31:24.800
You don't conquer the fucking world
with just a little bit of land

31:24.842 --> 31:25.926
and some intel about a law.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.469
You're right.

31:27.511 --> 31:30.764
We just need the best cannabis seeds
that ever existed.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.391
Those are also gone
with the wind,

31:32.433 --> 31:33.642
- if I recall correctly.
- No.

31:35.686 --> 31:41.233
What if I told you that an ex-boyfriend
of yours still had some seeds

31:41.275 --> 31:43.611
before that entire
past disappeared?

31:45.279 --> 31:46.280
How do you know?

31:48.824 --> 31:50.242
Well, go figure...

31:50.284 --> 31:51.994
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE, HONEY?

31:52.953 --> 31:54.413
Go figure, I found out...

31:56.498 --> 32:02.713
that Felix had gifted...
one of those joints to a friend.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.259
And first, I thought,
"It's from a different plant.

32:08.802 --> 32:11.639
It's nothing, just a coincidence.
Things that happen."

32:11.680 --> 32:16.143
But then my friend told me it was
the best joint he'd ever smoked

32:16.185 --> 32:17.269
in his fucking life.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.191
Look, what I'm here
to tell you is simple.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.070
This door that's been opened
could give us the chance

32:26.111 --> 32:27.529
to go where no one
in this country has ever gone.

32:28.989 --> 32:31.408
Do you want to walk through it?
To change your life?

32:38.957 --> 32:43.253
Honey, they both taste like shit, but
this one tastes better than the other.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.508
- What are they for?
- Where is Felix?

32:50.219 --> 32:52.096
That's the other problem.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.667
<i>You read my mind. I was
about to call you.</i>

33:22.126 --> 33:23.293
Really?

33:23.335 --> 33:25.170
I sent the weed you gave
me to my people.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.881
They said it was the
perfect ganja.

33:28.632 --> 33:29.341
They want to buy it all.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.301
<i>The plants, the seeds,
everything.</i>

33:32.928 --> 33:36.056
<i>I know you don't want to sell,
but these people are serious...</i>

33:36.098 --> 33:37.015
I want to sell.

33:38.142 --> 33:39.435
I want to sell it all.

33:40.018 --> 33:40.644
<i>Great.</i>

33:41.437 --> 33:42.479
I'll talk to them and
let you know.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.983
Okay, let me know, but it
has to be now.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.428
Those leaves look familiar.

34:16.847 --> 34:18.140
Your mom let me in.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.227
What are you doing here?

34:23.854 --> 34:25.689
How did you get ahold of that?

34:26.732 --> 34:28.734
I kept the seeds jar.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.444
Why?

34:32.905 --> 34:34.156
What are you doing here?

34:35.616 --> 34:38.827
Did you forget we agreed
never to see each other again?

34:38.869 --> 34:40.412
Ignacio said you didn't
let him speak.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.123
I have nothing to say to him.

34:45.292 --> 34:46.418
Or you.

34:52.633 --> 34:53.801
Where are you taking them?

34:57.429 --> 34:58.180
I'm selling them.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.808
- To whom?
- Does it matter?

35:00.849 --> 35:03.227
Don't do it. The government's
going to legalize cultivation.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.814
It's time to join forces again,
Felix.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.066
It's time to start that business
you always dreamed of.

35:09.733 --> 35:10.901
Join forces again?

35:11.819 --> 35:13.946
Starting a company means nothing

35:13.987 --> 35:16.532
without a sample crop
like that one,

35:16.573 --> 35:18.033
- and without an expert like you.
- No.

35:18.075 --> 35:19.576
I can get the land.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.995
We can have a product with
the quality that you wanted.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.874
The most elegant of all cannabis.
We'll be exporting in no time.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.584
Wasn't that your dream?

35:28.961 --> 35:31.129
I'm not interested in
dreaming anymore.

35:32.589 --> 35:34.132
Fuck, I'm tired of fighting.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.385
There's no need to fight.

35:39.721 --> 35:40.848
My mom has cancer.

35:42.307 --> 35:45.227
If I don't pay her insurance,
she can't have chemo.

35:46.770 --> 35:49.314
Fuck, all of that
sounds really nice,

35:49.356 --> 35:51.191
but... I have other
things on my plate.

35:52.734 --> 35:55.654
If I sell this today, my
problems will be over tomorrow,

35:55.696 --> 35:58.240
but if I start dreaming
about a business with you,

35:59.449 --> 36:01.785
who knows when money will
roll in, and...

36:04.079 --> 36:05.372
my mom will die.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.636
I know you'll oppose this,
but I won't accept it.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.929
- No.
- I won't accept it.

36:20.971 --> 36:21.930
Don't you dare.

36:21.972 --> 36:22.931
We'll pay the hospital tomorrow.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.558
- No.
- Yes.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.728
Fefe, I'm going with or without you.
There's no other option.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.271
Seriously.

36:32.232 --> 36:33.775
Fuck, it doesn't have
to be like this.

36:33.817 --> 36:37.529
But it is. What can we do?
That's life.

36:38.906 --> 36:42.075
You should let me help
you out a little.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.586
You know it's gonna be fine,
right?

37:06.224 --> 37:08.352
If we're doing do this,
we gotta do it right.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.398
We'll do it however you say.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.694
We have to prepare the land
and irrigation systems.

37:21.490 --> 37:23.825
If we're distributing en masse,
it has to be...

37:26.161 --> 37:27.079
the best.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.530
Where are the cannabis plants?

38:02.322 --> 38:03.657
He didn't want to sell.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.286
- Why not?
- He took it back at the last minute.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.208
Why?

38:17.170 --> 38:18.255
I'll talk to Ramiro.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.218
We're gonna have to
pay him a visit.

39:00.547 --> 39:01.506
Do you need anything?

39:08.138 --> 39:09.806
<i>Someone broke into my house.</i>

39:09.848 --> 39:11.558
<i>They searched the patio.</i>

39:11.600 --> 39:12.934
Did they take anything?

39:12.976 --> 39:14.978
<i>Luckily, we took the plants
where you said to.</i>

39:15.896 --> 39:18.023
You had nothing on the patio?

39:18.065 --> 39:20.025
- Nothing.
- Not even seeds?

39:20.067 --> 39:22.069
We moved everything, Mari.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.571
<i>Oh, that was lucky, Felix.</i>

39:26.406 --> 39:28.700
- It was Camila.
<i>-Camila?</i>

39:29.993 --> 39:32.704
The girl who wanted
to buy the plants. She...

39:33.789 --> 39:35.332
She knew where they were.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.250
<i>I think she's working
with someone.</i>

39:38.085 --> 39:39.503
Do we know who?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.004
No, no idea.

39:42.172 --> 39:44.591
We're gonna have to be careful,
Felix.

39:44.633 --> 39:47.302
There are dangerous people
in the criminal world.

39:48.887 --> 39:49.930
I know.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.353
And your mom? How is she?

39:57.813 --> 40:00.065
Fine. She has her first
chemo tomorrow.

40:03.235 --> 40:03.860
Thanks, Mari.

40:05.112 --> 40:08.448
<i>Don't</i> <i>worry.</i> <i>I'm</i> <i>here</i> <i>if</i> <i>you</i> <i>need
anything,</i> <i>okay?</i>

40:10.700 --> 40:11.618
I know.

40:12.369 --> 40:14.621
<i>-Felix.</i>
- Yeah?

40:17.332 --> 40:19.501
I'm very happy to see you again.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.469
Me too.

40:41.731 --> 40:43.900
We'll build the new
greenhouses here.

40:46.403 --> 40:47.737
I have a name for the company.

40:49.156 --> 40:51.616
- It's gonna be called Cannabicol.
- Cannabicol?

40:52.742 --> 40:55.078
Awful. That's not my
company's name.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.746
What will it be, then?

40:56.788 --> 41:00.208
What about... KannaLab?

41:01.793 --> 41:04.671
- KannaLab? I like it.
- You like it?

41:04.713 --> 41:05.422
Yes, it's good.

41:06.256 --> 41:08.175
- I like KannaLab.
- Do you?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.302
- KannaLab.
- KannaLab.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.054
We have a name.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.434
Thanks for helping
with my dream.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.645
Oof, good luck!

41:21.396 --> 41:23.190
Okay, the time has come.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.027
What the fuck are you doing?

41:27.569 --> 41:28.778
Hello, Dad.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.656
Have you lost your mind?
What's going on here?

41:31.698 --> 41:34.034
What I told you about
this morning.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.286
- This doesn't make sense.
- Of course it does.

41:36.328 --> 41:39.706
I'm taking just one of the crops
that's in my name. That's it.

41:39.748 --> 41:42.584
As of this morning, it's the
property of my cannabis company.

41:43.752 --> 41:46.588
- Cannabis? You mean...?
- Marijuana, Dad.

41:50.634 --> 41:52.969
I'm going to speak
to my lawyers.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.972
That's great. In fact,
they are waiting for you.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.224
Go ahead.

41:59.809 --> 42:01.561
How can you do this to me?

42:01.603 --> 42:05.273
Do what to you?
I'm not doing anything, Dad.

42:06.650 --> 42:08.652
This company has 15
crops like these.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.904
What did I do? I took one,
and it's mine.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.072
Yes, but...

42:14.407 --> 42:17.202
this is the one your mom's
family started with.

42:17.244 --> 42:19.955
It has a sentimental
value to me.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.748
And for me too.

42:29.422 --> 42:33.051
This is all because of the party.
Okay, let's forget about that.

42:33.093 --> 42:36.137
- It has nothing to do...
- Let's review the packaging again.

42:36.179 --> 42:37.764
Dad, the packaging is done with.

42:38.974 --> 42:40.558
It has nothing to do with that.

42:42.894 --> 42:45.105
There's no going back.
I mean it.

42:46.773 --> 42:48.858
The backhoes are ready to go.

44:34.255 --> 44:35.673
Wake up, Felix!

44:35.715 --> 44:37.133
We have to go!

44:37.759 --> 44:38.426
Where are we?

44:39.135 --> 44:40.428
We're in deep shit.

44:40.470 --> 44:42.263
Please, we need to go, let's go!

44:42.305 --> 44:43.223
Let's go.

44:53.733 --> 44:54.734
What happened?

44:55.110 --> 44:57.445
He's dead. We just found him.

44:57.487 --> 44:59.697
We have to go now! Let's go!

45:03.535 --> 45:04.702
Shit.
