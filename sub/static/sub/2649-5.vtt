WEBVTT

00:02.004 --> 00:03.255
Hey, sir.

00:03.338 --> 00:05.883
Duane Bailey, running
for town council reelection.

00:05.966 --> 00:08.260
Oh, don't look. There's
that jerk Duane Bailey.

00:08.343 --> 00:09.511
Oh, yuck.

00:09.595 --> 00:11.180
I should say something
to him, shouldn't I?

00:11.263 --> 00:13.348
I gotta be honest. I was
just working off your tone.

00:13.432 --> 00:14.975
Who's Duane Bailey,
and why do we hate him?

00:15.058 --> 00:18.437
Honey, he's that councilman who
shot down my stop sign. Big phony.

00:18.562 --> 00:20.147
Yeah. Hey.
Duane Bailey,

00:20.230 --> 00:21.815
seeking reelection,
town council.

00:21.899 --> 00:24.026
Hoping I can count on your vote.
Well, you just got it.

00:24.109 --> 00:25.068
Phil.

00:25.152 --> 00:27.154
You don't remember
meeting me, do you?

00:27.237 --> 00:30.199
Claire Dunphy. Last month's
town council meeting?

00:30.282 --> 00:33.202
Oh, yes, I do.
Yes, I remember you.

00:33.285 --> 00:35.746
"I want a stop sign."

00:35.829 --> 00:38.582
Just having fun.
Here. Have a pen.

00:39.791 --> 00:43.378
"Duane Bailey. Councilman.
Citizen. Puggle breeder."

00:43.462 --> 00:46.423
I love them because they're
a different mix of breeds.

00:46.506 --> 00:48.258
Just like America.

00:48.342 --> 00:50.636
- I like what he's saying, Claire.
- He isn't saying anything.

00:50.761 --> 00:53.347
He is. We need a stop
sign at our intersection.

00:53.430 --> 00:54.890
Everyone says that,

00:54.973 --> 00:57.392
but pretty soon, we're stopping
at every single corner.

00:57.476 --> 00:59.686
Why don't you go ask Canada
how that's working out?

00:59.770 --> 01:02.481
Hi. Duane Bailey. Hi.
Nailed it.

01:03.815 --> 01:05.692
"Actor-writer-director
who packs a punch."

01:05.817 --> 01:08.153
Oh, Sylvester Stallone. I said it first.
Sylvester Stallone.

01:09.655 --> 01:12.282
Oh, my God. This guy
brought his kids, Mitchell.

01:12.366 --> 01:15.244
My God. To this movie? isn't it
supposed to be super violent?

01:15.327 --> 01:17.371
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to overstep,

01:17.454 --> 01:20.165
but I don't know that this movie
is really appropriate for children.

01:20.249 --> 01:23.210
I'm terrified to see it. That's
why we're here during the day.

01:23.293 --> 01:25.504
It's okay. We're good.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.298
Okay. I tried.

01:28.382 --> 01:30.384
Yeah.
All you can do.

01:31.343 --> 01:33.095
You know,
I've read this book,

01:33.178 --> 01:36.306
and I know what's gonna happen,
and it's very disturbing.

01:36.390 --> 01:39.101
I really think you might be inviting
some pretty serious nightmares here.

01:39.184 --> 01:42.062
Hey, buddy,
they're my kids. I got it.

01:42.187 --> 01:45.440
Yeah, but I don't think you do. Cam. Cam.
He says he's got it, all right?

01:45.524 --> 01:48.694
You've said your piece.
Just watch the movie.

01:49.820 --> 01:50.946
Oh, uh, Gwyneth Paltrow.

01:51.029 --> 01:53.282
I really must insist you
not traumatize your kids...

01:53.407 --> 01:55.367
by exposing them to gratuitous
violence- Cam. Stop it.

01:55.492 --> 01:56.952
And graphic depictions of-
Shh, shh.

01:57.035 --> 01:58.745
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:58.829 --> 02:00.789
- Yeah, well, you're gonna be.
- I'm gonna tell you one more time.

02:00.914 --> 02:03.000
No, I'm gonna tell you
one more time. Okay.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.085
It was The Muppet Movie.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.421
We were
in the wrong theater.

02:08.755 --> 02:11.800
Enjoy the show. I was always
a fan of the Muppets,

02:11.883 --> 02:13.802
especially the two guys in the
theater who wouldn't shut up.

02:13.885 --> 02:15.053
Just leave!

02:15.887 --> 02:17.764
# Hey, hey #

02:17.848 --> 02:19.850
# Hey, hey #

02:19.933 --> 02:21.977
# Hey, hey #

02:22.060 --> 02:23.937
# Hey, hey #

02:24.021 --> 02:25.188
# Hey ##

02:30.485 --> 02:31.903
Hello?  I'm running late.

02:31.987 --> 02:34.448
This knucklehead's kept me
waiting for over an hour.

02:34.531 --> 02:37.284
I never had to wait like this
when his dad was running things.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.453
Yeah.
And soda was a nickel.

02:39.536 --> 02:41.830
Just tell him
that your family is coming over.

02:41.913 --> 02:44.499
This guy fired his own father.
He's not gonna care about my family.

02:44.583 --> 02:47.586
Okay, then just leave.
You don't need his money.

02:47.669 --> 02:51.089
Once a week, I have eight family members
coming to my house for free food.

02:51.173 --> 02:53.133
I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.052
I see you when I see you.

02:58.013 --> 02:59.723
Are you okay? What is wrong?

02:59.848 --> 03:02.476
I wanna be homeschooled.
Really, Manny?

03:02.559 --> 03:04.853
Do you want me
to learn you English?

03:04.936 --> 03:06.688
What is going on?

03:06.772 --> 03:09.775
I have a big report due in. The teachers
don't seem to care about the substance.

03:09.858 --> 03:11.777
All they care about is the flash.

03:11.860 --> 03:14.404
Manny, sometimes you can be
a little bit old-fashioned.

03:14.488 --> 03:17.949
Remember the first time you saw the
kids with the backpacks with wheels...

03:18.033 --> 03:20.202
and you thought
they were too flashy?

03:20.285 --> 03:22.496
You're going to school,
not boarding a flight to Denver.

03:22.579 --> 03:26.375
It's getting absurd. Reuben freestyle-rapped
his report on Irish immigrants.

03:26.458 --> 03:30.212
That doesn't even make sense.
Maybe you do a Riverdance. Maybe.

03:30.337 --> 03:32.756
What is your report on?
The mafia.

03:32.839 --> 03:36.051
Perfect.
We do a papier-méché tommy gun.

03:36.134 --> 03:37.886
No, we shouldn't have
to jazz it up.

03:37.969 --> 03:41.390
Then we go upstairs and we get your old
rocking horse and we chop the head off.

03:41.473 --> 03:44.476
No, that's a terrible idea.
I love Brownie.

03:44.559 --> 03:47.771
Do you want to send
a message or not?

03:47.854 --> 03:50.357
Jay never wants me
to help him with his business.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.610
And now suddenly, Manny doesn't
want to listen to me either.

03:53.693 --> 03:55.404
It's very frustrating.

03:55.487 --> 03:57.489
I have all the answers.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.783
Hey, here he is!

03:59.908 --> 04:02.160
Hey, bring it in, Jay.
How you doing, Joshie?

04:02.244 --> 04:04.413
It's Josh now. Have a seat.

04:04.496 --> 04:06.706
Ah. All right.

04:06.790 --> 04:09.793
So, I flipped through your
proposal, and here's the thing.

04:09.876 --> 04:12.754
We're about to build our largest
luxury condo complex yet,

04:12.838 --> 04:14.714
and I have
an important question for you.

04:14.798 --> 04:16.882
What is it
you wanna build?

04:18.844 --> 04:20.095
Closets.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.889
See, I was kinda hoping
you'd say dreams.

04:23.014 --> 04:25.475
Thought that was implied.

04:25.559 --> 04:28.270
Jay, I'm looking for closets
nobody's ever seen before.

04:28.353 --> 04:30.814
You know, a big "wow!"
You know what I'm saying?

04:30.897 --> 04:34.818
You want a nice closet with sharp design,
quality materials and expert craftsmanship.

04:34.901 --> 04:38.447
Uh, I mean, I want it
to be like- Barn!

04:38.530 --> 04:42.909
You know, people are gonna walk in there
and go, "Whoa! What do I hang first?"

04:42.993 --> 04:45.495
I wanted to hang myself.

04:45.579 --> 04:47.706
Let's talk more specific.

04:47.789 --> 04:49.708
What exactly do you like,
and what don't you like?

04:49.791 --> 04:51.293
All right, fair enough.

04:51.376 --> 04:54.796
Uh, I don't like this.
This makes me sad.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.091
I do like
getting my mind blown.

04:58.175 --> 05:00.010
I love your enthusiasm.

05:00.093 --> 05:04.139
Uh, before I go off in the wrong
direction, how about an example?

05:04.222 --> 05:07.142
All right, check this out. So three
weeks ago, I'm down in South Beach.

05:07.225 --> 05:09.269
I walk into this thumpin' club.

05:09.352 --> 05:13.690
Bartender says, "What do you
wanna drink?" I say, "Wow me."

05:13.773 --> 05:18.111
He mixes this thing together. I take
one sip, and I'm like, "Hello, nurse!"

05:18.195 --> 05:20.947
And she's like, "You've
been unconscious for two days."

05:21.031 --> 05:22.949
That's what I want in a closet.

05:24.576 --> 05:27.078
I don't think
I need to hear any more.

05:30.999 --> 05:33.001
What you doing there,
homework?

05:33.084 --> 05:35.670
- What do you want?
- I need to borrow some money.

05:35.754 --> 05:37.255
It's really important.

05:37.339 --> 05:38.632
How much?

05:38.715 --> 05:40.300
$900.

05:40.425 --> 05:42.177
What?
Come on.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.430
If you were in trouble,
I would do anything for you.

05:45.514 --> 05:48.183
We're not just sisters.

05:48.266 --> 05:50.393
We're best friends.

05:51.811 --> 05:55.315
Look, I would if I could,
but I don't have any money.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.025
And since we're talking,

05:57.108 --> 05:59.444
I- I've never told anyone
this before, and it-

06:00.904 --> 06:04.157
Wipe that smug smile
off his stupid face.

06:04.241 --> 06:05.700
His face is stupid.

06:05.784 --> 06:09.246
Oh, I can't believe ridiculous
people like him end up in office.

06:09.329 --> 06:11.289
Well, why don't you run?

06:11.373 --> 06:13.375
You're smart.
You care about the community.

06:13.458 --> 06:16.294
And you're easy on the eyes
when you put a little effort into it.

06:16.378 --> 06:17.921
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

06:18.004 --> 06:20.549
Maybe change out of the sweaty gym
clothes every once in a while-

06:20.632 --> 06:24.261
But you were talking about
running for office. Go on.

06:24.344 --> 06:26.388
I'd be lying if I said
I'd never thought about it.

06:26.471 --> 06:28.473
I know it's a ridiculous
little local thing,

06:28.557 --> 06:31.059
but it might be fun to
get out there and contribute.

06:31.142 --> 06:32.769
Plus I think I'd be good at it.

06:32.894 --> 06:34.396
You'd be great.
Mmm.

06:34.479 --> 06:37.732
How would this work? Who would be
here for the kids after school?

06:37.816 --> 06:40.026
Who would take them
to practice and recitals...

06:40.110 --> 06:42.487
and keep them from
burning the house down?

06:42.571 --> 06:45.031
It must be so hard
being a single mom.

06:45.156 --> 06:47.492
Oh-
Claire, I will.

06:48.910 --> 06:51.162
If you wanna fly, I'm not gonna
hold your feet to the ground.

06:51.288 --> 06:54.374
Hmm. I wanna be the one to
push you off the cliff.

06:55.292 --> 06:58.003
I think I'm gonna do it.
Great.

06:58.128 --> 06:59.546
Go fly.
Phil!

06:59.671 --> 07:01.131
No.
Phil!

07:02.424 --> 07:04.676
I'll admit it.
I'm turned on by powerful women.

07:04.759 --> 07:08.763
Michelle Obama, Oprah, Condoleezza
Rice, Serena Williams-

07:08.847 --> 07:10.390
Wait a minute.

07:14.394 --> 07:16.521
Do you want a fry?
No, I can't eat.

07:16.605 --> 07:18.356
We should've stayed
to see the Muppets.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.442
I can't even look at ketchup
without seeing blood.

07:20.525 --> 07:22.819
Oh, runaway curly fry.
You know, these are good luck.

07:25.697 --> 07:26.865
Oh!

07:26.990 --> 07:28.908
Oh, my God. What was that?
We just got rear-ended.

07:28.992 --> 07:31.119
Well, pull off to the side street.
Pull off to the side street.

07:31.244 --> 07:34.039
Oh! Are you okay? Oh, I think I cut
the roof of my mouth on the straw.

07:34.164 --> 07:36.082
Oh, my God. Mmm!
So yes.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.503
Oh, boy.
I'm so sorry.

07:40.587 --> 07:42.672
This is all my fault.
You guys okay?

07:42.756 --> 07:45.550
Well- Well, I-l sustained
a minor mouth injury.

07:45.675 --> 07:48.470
We're fine, thank you. Look, I feel terrible.

07:48.553 --> 07:50.055
Don't worry. I'm gonna
take care of everything.

07:50.138 --> 07:51.514
Let me just get
my insurance info.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.099
Thank you.

07:53.224 --> 07:54.684
Well, he seems nice.
Yeah.

07:54.768 --> 07:57.520
If this were a romantic comedy,
this would be our meet-cute.

07:57.604 --> 08:01.358
We'd spend the rest of the afternoon
drinking wine, eating food, flying a kite,

08:01.441 --> 08:02.942
you know,
doing montage-y stuff.

08:03.068 --> 08:05.904
Am I in this movie of yours? Yeah,
you're the gay best friend.

08:06.029 --> 08:07.614
Oh, my God!

08:07.739 --> 08:10.450
Oh, my God! We got a runner!
Um, it's D-1- I can't read it.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.327
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Go where?

08:12.410 --> 08:14.245
- We have to chase him down!
- You're not supposed to.

08:14.329 --> 08:16.331
Help! Stop that car!

08:16.414 --> 08:18.416
He's getting away! Help!

08:18.500 --> 08:21.336
You almost got him, Cam.
You almost got him.

08:21.419 --> 08:23.254
He's getting away!

08:25.382 --> 08:28.093
Hey. What you doing, playing?

08:28.927 --> 08:30.220
Yeah.

08:30.303 --> 08:32.722
Do you have any money saved up?

08:33.765 --> 08:35.767
I'm comfortable.

08:35.850 --> 08:40.105
I've saved $1,217.
It wasn't even that hard.

08:40.188 --> 08:42.357
Don't forget your lunch.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.734
Thanks, Mom.

08:44.818 --> 08:46.778
Don't forget
your lunch money, buddy.

08:46.903 --> 08:48.905
Thanks, Dad.
You bet.

08:53.368 --> 08:55.537
Please.
it's really important.

08:55.620 --> 08:59.791
Look, I'd love to help you out,
but I'm not very liquid right now.

08:59.874 --> 09:01.626
It's in a block of ice.

09:01.710 --> 09:06.423
I got the idea when I heard about
rich guyswith frozen assets.

09:07.799 --> 09:09.634
"Ass-ets."

09:11.761 --> 09:14.556
I am running
for town council,

09:14.639 --> 09:17.308
and I understand
that I can pick up a form here.

09:17.392 --> 09:20.311
Fourth floor.
Elevator down the hall.

09:20.395 --> 09:22.981
Beyoncé, when'd you start working here?

09:23.064 --> 09:26.609
Oh, Duane. He's always
saying stuff like that.

09:26.693 --> 09:28.445
Duane Bailey.
Running for reelection.

09:28.528 --> 09:29.821
You're joking.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.823
I just saw you in the
parking lot two hours ago.

09:31.906 --> 09:33.241
Oh!

09:33.324 --> 09:37.120
Hey, it's you. Oh, it's you.
What are you doing here?

09:37.203 --> 09:41.416
I am entering the race for town
council, and I am running against you.

09:41.499 --> 09:43.585
Oh. Well,
don't you have pluck.

09:43.668 --> 09:46.129
No, I plan on winning, so-
Yeah, I bet you do.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.715
Marsha! Rockin' the bangs.
Love it

09:48.798 --> 09:51.342
Do you know why, of all the dogs
in the world, I breed puggles?

09:51.426 --> 09:53.928
Why do I feel like this is a rhetorical
question, and you're about to lau-

09:54.012 --> 09:55.638
it's because
they're lovable, yes,

09:55.722 --> 10:00.185
but they're also tenacious hunters who
won't quit until the kill is complete.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.312
Really? 'Cause I feel
like they just yip a lot.

10:02.395 --> 10:04.314
Look, lady,
you're going down.

10:04.397 --> 10:07.692
I've won six straight elections. I don't
plan on losing to some bored housewife.

10:07.776 --> 10:11.571
So don't quit
your lack of a day job.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.323
Excuse me!

10:13.406 --> 10:16.117
Excuse me! I-

10:16.201 --> 10:17.577
Excuse me.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.954
Hello?

10:20.038 --> 10:21.080
Anne?

10:22.290 --> 10:24.417
Haley did that?

10:24.501 --> 10:26.836
Oh, God. Okay, um-

10:26.920 --> 10:29.339
I'll call you right back.

10:29.422 --> 10:33.802
For your information, sir,
I am no bored housewife.

10:33.885 --> 10:37.347
L-I would kill for bored.
Why isn't this lighting up?

10:37.430 --> 10:41.142
Oh, it's because
it's staff only. The, uh-

10:41.226 --> 10:45.355
Here. Allow me to...
not get that for you.

10:45.438 --> 10:47.357
Good luck!

10:50.860 --> 10:52.737
Dad, I cut my arm.

10:52.821 --> 10:54.823
Oh, wow.
You sure did, buddy.

10:54.948 --> 10:57.200
Ow.
I'll get you fixed up.

10:57.283 --> 10:58.368
Where's Mom?

10:58.451 --> 11:00.411
She belongs
to the people now.

11:00.495 --> 11:03.039
My allergies
are acting up again.

11:03.122 --> 11:05.708
Well, it is your lucky day,

11:05.792 --> 11:10.839
because, missy, Dr. Dad
has everything you need.

11:10.922 --> 11:14.926
Behold the healing powers
of grape flavoring.

11:15.009 --> 11:17.136
- Where's Mom?
- Some people took her.

11:17.220 --> 11:18.930
Drink this.
Listen, guys.

11:19.013 --> 11:23.476
Your mom is taking on more
responsibilities outside of the house.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.646
But don't you worry.
Good old-

11:26.771 --> 11:28.857
Oh, my goodness!
Ow!

11:28.982 --> 11:31.734
I'm so sorry.
You punched me.

11:31.818 --> 11:33.945
Dad, you gave me
the drowsy kind.

11:34.028 --> 11:35.572
There's a drowsy kind?

11:35.655 --> 11:38.616
- I have to study for a test!
- Oh, it really hurts!

11:38.741 --> 11:40.743
Well, I'll get you some ice.
No, no, no, no!

11:40.827 --> 11:42.328
I'll get it.

11:47.292 --> 11:49.711
Oh, you made it.
How was it?

11:49.836 --> 11:51.671
Eh.
Why? What's wrong, babe?

11:51.796 --> 11:54.757
I don't wanna talk about it.
Do it anyways.

11:54.841 --> 11:56.926
This stupid kid's been in the
business about 10 minutes.

11:57.010 --> 12:00.889
He barely looks at my proposal,
and he says he wants more "wow."

12:00.972 --> 12:02.682
What does he mean
by more "wow"?

12:02.765 --> 12:04.434
It's the Bieberization
of America.

12:04.517 --> 12:06.227
What do beavers have
to do with anything?

12:06.311 --> 12:09.814
The beavers, they build the dams all
over the country so there's no floods.

12:09.898 --> 12:12.859
It's the beaverization
of the Americas.

12:12.942 --> 12:16.321
I'm finding there's less and
less we can talk about.

12:16.404 --> 12:20.158
So why didn't you tell him that you've
been in the business for such a long time-

12:20.241 --> 12:22.660
Gloria, it's not gonna make any difference.
He wants to make a change.

12:22.744 --> 12:24.704
And I got a factory full of
people depending on this.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.456
Yeah, but
maybe if you tell him that-

12:26.539 --> 12:30.168
Gloria, please. I've had a tough day.
Can we please not talk about it?

12:30.293 --> 12:33.296
But I want to help. Trust me.
I wish you had the answers.

12:33.379 --> 12:35.214
I do!

12:35.340 --> 12:36.883
Hey, guys.
Hey, Grandpa.

12:37.008 --> 12:39.302
Hey, Grandpa. Hey, Jay.

12:39.427 --> 12:41.471
What's with her? Just tired.
Growth spurt.

12:41.596 --> 12:43.640
Hey, hey.
Hi, guys.

12:43.723 --> 12:46.559
- Hi, baby girl.
- Hola, Lily.

12:46.643 --> 12:48.102
How are you?

12:48.186 --> 12:50.605
Dads are fighting.
No. Uh, we're not fighting.

12:50.688 --> 12:53.858
No, not at all, honey. No. Uh,
go play, sweetheart. Okay?

12:53.983 --> 12:56.736
Let's go play with some blocks. Let's
go stack some blocks. All right.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.739
Okay. The reason we're fighting is
'cause this one thinks he's Dirty Harry.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.991
Having a tough time picturing
Clint Eastwood in that shirt.

13:02.075 --> 13:04.827
Okay, let me ask you something.
Today, at a stoplight,

13:04.911 --> 13:07.497
a guy ran into our car
and then just took off.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.582
I wanted to chase after him.
Mitchell-

13:09.666 --> 13:11.960
Kept a level head
and called the police.

13:12.043 --> 13:15.588
Police. Aren't they too busy
winning the war on drugs?

13:16.714 --> 13:18.424
Okay, so which one of us
did the right thing?

13:18.508 --> 13:20.426
Hit-and-run. Gotta chase 'em down.

13:20.510 --> 13:22.011
I chase the people
all the time.

13:22.095 --> 13:24.722
No, no. That-That's
irresponsible and dangerous.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.767
What if he had been armed? He wasn't armed.
He had a Hillary bumper sticker.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.602
This isn't
an isolated incident.

13:29.727 --> 13:32.480
This morning, he flipped out at somebody
at The Muppet' Movie.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.316
You saw The Muppet' Movie
without me?

13:35.400 --> 13:38.069
- Oh, no.
- No, honey, just the first two numbers.

13:38.194 --> 13:39.904
No. Lily-  Hi, hi, hi.

13:39.988 --> 13:41.948
Phil, where are you, honey?
I need to talk to you.

13:42.031 --> 13:43.491
Do you know
what our daughter did?

13:43.574 --> 13:45.159
Nothing. She's fine.
She's reading.

13:45.243 --> 13:47.328
No, not her. Haley. Haley!

13:47.453 --> 13:49.372
Come over here. I wanna talk to you.
There she is.

13:49.455 --> 13:50.999
Not a scratch on her.

13:51.082 --> 13:53.668
You have something you
wanna say to us? Uh-

13:53.751 --> 13:55.878
Mmm, let me
help you out here.

13:55.962 --> 13:57.880
Fake I.D.'s?
What?

13:57.964 --> 14:02.343
Mm-hmm. Haley tried to get her and
her friends some fake I.D.'s.

14:02.427 --> 14:04.512
I wasn't going to use them
for drinking.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.056
We just wanted to get
into this club to see a band.

14:07.140 --> 14:10.184
She took a bunch of money from
them, and then she lost it.

14:10.268 --> 14:12.020
How much?
$900.

14:12.145 --> 14:14.397
Oh, my God! Oh!
You're kidding me!

14:14.480 --> 14:18.693
It's not my fault! I gave money to this guy.
He's the one who ripped us off.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.737
What happened
to your face?

14:20.862 --> 14:23.781
Oh. I ran into a door.
Yeah.

14:23.865 --> 14:25.491
- What happened to your face?
- Dad hit me.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.118
It was an accident.
Phil!

14:27.201 --> 14:29.412
I was trying to open up a Band-Aid.

14:29.495 --> 14:31.831
- What's wrong with her?
- Growth spurt.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.708
- What's wrong with her?
- I drugged her.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.836
Phil- I accidentally gave her
the nighttime allergy medicine.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.380
Mmm. All right,
one thing at a time.

14:39.464 --> 14:42.341
Haley, how are you going
to repay your friends?

14:42.467 --> 14:44.177
I don't know.  I know.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.845
You go there
with a couple of guys-

14:45.928 --> 14:47.930
She's gotta get the money back.
Who is this kid?

14:48.014 --> 14:50.892
A guy at school's cousin's friend.
He lives in Gardena.

14:50.975 --> 14:52.935
Well, if you know where he
lives, just call the police.

14:53.019 --> 14:55.605
No cops. We can't afford
a scandal right now.

14:55.688 --> 14:57.732
Claire's running
for town council.

14:57.815 --> 15:00.735
That was before, when I thought you
could take care of the children.

15:00.818 --> 15:03.029
I take my eye off
the ball for one minute,

15:03.112 --> 15:06.365
and I've got one in a coma, one with a
black eye and one running a crime ring.

15:06.449 --> 15:09.077
Well, to be fair,
Haley started her crime ring...

15:09.160 --> 15:11.162
when your eye
was still on the ball.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.914
It's not a crime ring.

15:12.997 --> 15:15.416
I just gotta get
my hands on that $900.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.668
I know how the mafia
would handle this.

15:17.794 --> 15:20.296
The kid is right.

15:20.379 --> 15:23.007
I'm sick of these smart-ass punks
who keep changing the rules...

15:23.091 --> 15:25.093
and think they can get away
with anything they want.

15:25.176 --> 15:27.512
I'm gonna pay this guy a visit.
Haley, text me his address.

15:27.595 --> 15:29.097
I'm going with you.
Me too.

15:29.180 --> 15:32.183
Oh, no. No. Nobody's going anywhere, okay?
We're not vigilantes.

15:32.266 --> 15:35.186
Shotgun!
No! No weapons!

15:40.399 --> 15:42.318
In my country,
it is tradition.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.362
When the men are out
seeking vengeance,

15:44.445 --> 15:46.364
the women stay home
and they drink.

15:46.447 --> 15:48.950
Sometimes I think
you just make this stuff up.

15:49.075 --> 15:51.786
Do you want a drink or not?
Oh, yeah.

15:51.869 --> 15:54.163
So, what happened?

15:54.247 --> 15:56.332
You were running for office,
and now you're not?

15:56.415 --> 15:58.292
Mmm. I don't really
wanna talk about that.

15:58.376 --> 16:01.504
Ay, no. I am sick and tired
of no one needing my help.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.631
You are going to tell me
what is wrong,

16:03.714 --> 16:07.009
and I'm gonna give you the right
answer, because I have all of them.

16:07.093 --> 16:10.012
So, why are you not
running for office?

16:10.096 --> 16:13.599
Because my family needs me too much.
You saw what just happened.

16:13.724 --> 16:17.019
Why are you not running for office?
Uh, that doesn't work with me.

16:17.103 --> 16:18.938
Why are you
not running for office?

16:19.021 --> 16:21.315
Because I don't want to lose!

16:21.399 --> 16:26.445
I- I haven't done anything
outside of my house in 18 years.

16:26.529 --> 16:29.407
I don't want the first thing I
do to be a complete failure.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.034
Okay.

16:32.118 --> 16:36.914
I'm gonna tell you a story about a little
girl who entered a beauty pageant-

16:37.039 --> 16:38.791
even though ...

16:38.875 --> 16:41.627
She was very, very scared
that she was going to lose.

16:41.711 --> 16:43.588
Let me guess.
You won.

16:43.713 --> 16:46.549
Of course I won. But I was talking
about my cousin Maria Conchita.

16:46.632 --> 16:49.969
She had a nose like a toucan. She
stuff her body in this bikini.

16:50.052 --> 16:53.014
And at the end,
she finish dead last.

16:53.097 --> 16:55.808
How is that a good story?

16:55.892 --> 16:59.896
She faced her fears,
and it didn't kill her.

17:01.606 --> 17:03.733
What killed her
two weeks later was a bus.

17:03.816 --> 17:05.318
Are you serious?

17:05.401 --> 17:08.779
Because she couldn't see anything
coming with that big nose.

17:09.614 --> 17:12.116
This guy has won
six elections.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.117
I am way out of my league.

17:14.202 --> 17:15.869
Look, I don't know
anything about this guy.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.122
But I know
that you're a tough lady,

17:18.205 --> 17:20.374
and I come from a family
of tough ladies.

17:20.458 --> 17:23.461
And I have to say, sometimes
you scare me a little bit.

17:23.544 --> 17:26.255
And I know that you're
strong enough to win...

17:26.339 --> 17:29.425
and definitely strong enough
to be okay if you lose.

17:30.509 --> 17:32.511
I scare you?
Are you kidding me?

17:32.595 --> 17:35.681
"I want
Thanksgiving at my house!"

17:35.765 --> 17:38.476
Why does everybody
think I talk like that?

17:41.646 --> 17:43.356
This is it.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.026
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, come on.
Do we have a plan?

17:47.109 --> 17:49.320
It doesn't seem like we have a plan.
Yeah, I got a plan.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.697
Either he gives us the money, or
he gets a private performance...

17:51.781 --> 17:53.866
from England Dan
and John Ford Coley.

17:53.950 --> 17:55.910
That's not a good plan.
That's not even a good band.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.746
If all you're gonna do is
criticize, just wait by the car.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.248
Okay, fine.

18:00.331 --> 18:02.250
I'll see you in jail.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.377
It's gonna be a big
adjustment for two of you.

18:13.594 --> 18:15.429
Yeah?
You Peter?

18:15.513 --> 18:17.431
What do you want?
You know Haley Dunphy?

18:17.556 --> 18:20.518
You owe her $900. We're
here to collect. You dig?

18:20.601 --> 18:24.855
I tried to call that girl 10 times,
but her voice mail was always full.

18:24.939 --> 18:26.440
That does sound
like Haley.

18:26.524 --> 18:28.567
So how are you
gonna make this right?

18:28.651 --> 18:30.611
You guys want the money, right?
That's fine.

18:30.695 --> 18:32.697
I don't need any hassle.
Hold on.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.782
I'll just-
I'll grab it.

18:38.286 --> 18:40.454
That was easy.

18:40.538 --> 18:42.331
He's lucky
he didn't put up a fight.

18:42.415 --> 18:46.669
I would've treated him to a reunion
of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.339
- Oh, my God! We got a runner!
- Stop!

18:50.423 --> 18:51.924
- Get him! Get him!
- Stop!

18:52.049 --> 18:54.552
Stop!

18:56.012 --> 18:58.180
No!No!No!

18:58.306 --> 19:00.057
No!

19:00.141 --> 19:01.851
Got him!

19:01.934 --> 19:04.687
- Oh, my God! You did!
- Don't be so surprised!

19:04.770 --> 19:06.272
Help! He's slipping out
of his skinny jeans!

19:06.355 --> 19:07.315
Okay!

19:09.442 --> 19:11.444
These are cute.
I totally have these.

19:13.738 --> 19:15.281
Hmm?
Ah-ha-ha.

19:15.406 --> 19:17.700
Oh! There you go.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.285
Oh, you got it back!
Thank you!

19:19.368 --> 19:21.412
Hey, don't thank me.
Thank your Uncle Mitchell.

19:21.495 --> 19:24.123
He's the one who tackled the guy.
I got grass stains.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.834
Well, I will
tell you one thing.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.878
I have learned my lesson.

19:28.961 --> 19:32.465
Disappointing my family and
friends is punishment enough.

19:32.548 --> 19:35.509
Nice try. You're
grounded for two weeks.

19:35.593 --> 19:38.387
Okay, we have big news.

19:38.471 --> 19:43.059
Claire has decided
to run for mayor after all.

19:43.142 --> 19:45.102
Thank you.
it's town council.

19:45.186 --> 19:47.146
It doesn't matter.
You're not going to win anyways.

19:48.147 --> 19:50.149
But she's going to be okay.
You see?

19:50.232 --> 19:53.903
I help the people. Why don't
you two let me help you?

19:53.986 --> 19:55.988
Well, I can't
speak for Jay,

19:56.072 --> 19:59.533
but I guess I'm just too
proud to ask for help.

19:59.617 --> 20:01.660
Are you serious?
She cuts your steak.

20:01.744 --> 20:04.997
- What about you?
- I don't wanna bother you with my business.

20:05.081 --> 20:06.916
- What else do I do every day?
- I don't know.

20:06.999 --> 20:10.002
I'm guessing the gym
and... one other thing.

20:10.086 --> 20:13.089
Dad, you should listen to her.
She might really help you.

20:13.214 --> 20:15.424
Huh.
She could be an asset.

20:17.468 --> 20:19.762
"Ass-et."
Heard it.

20:19.845 --> 20:21.055
Hmm.

20:21.138 --> 20:23.391
And look at the shelves
over here.

20:23.474 --> 20:26.018
They're for the shoes.
Those are my favorite ones.

20:26.102 --> 20:27.603
So what did you think?

20:30.022 --> 20:31.482
Wow.

20:33.401 --> 20:36.737
Same exact closet.

20:40.825 --> 20:42.576
We never needed fake I.D.'s
on a farm.

20:42.660 --> 20:46.247
We figured if a 16-year-old could drive
a tractor, he could drink a beer.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.916
Not at the same time, of course.
it's Missouri, not Texas.

20:50.459 --> 20:52.586
I used a fake I.D.
to get into an R-rated movie.

20:52.670 --> 20:54.588
The Fabulous Baker Boys.

20:54.672 --> 20:56.632
I found the title
to be misleading.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.717
Lot of Michelle Pfeiffer.
That's all I'm saying.

20:58.801 --> 21:00.845
I remember
when I got my fake I.D.

21:00.970 --> 21:03.264
- Me too. Crazy times.
- Hell, yeah.

21:03.347 --> 21:05.599
I tried to enlist in the army,
but they saw right through me.

21:05.683 --> 21:07.643
So me and a bunch of guys
drove across state lines.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.229
We got a bunch of booze.
We loaded up on fireworks.

21:10.312 --> 21:14.608
And I woke up in the morning,
I kid you not, in a Mexican strip joint.

21:14.692 --> 21:17.611
I .

21:17.695 --> 21:21.115
Oh, I used mine to rent
some bowling shoes and kept 'em.

21:21.198 --> 21:25.035
Suckers probably spent months
trying to track down Dr. Richard Hertz.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.122
Think about it.

21:35.254 --> 21:36.255
English - US - PSDH
