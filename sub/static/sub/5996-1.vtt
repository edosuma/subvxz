WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:01.769
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hey, you guys.

00:01.802 --> 00:02.770
Welcome back.

00:02.803 --> 00:03.804
When Jane was young,

00:03.836 --> 00:05.173
her grandmother taught her

00:05.206 --> 00:07.108
to protect her flower.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.644
And so, Jane waited.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.780
Which wasn't always easy.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.515
This was Jane's fiancé Michael.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.117
He's a detective.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.419
Their life was perfectly
 on track until...

00:18.452 --> 00:20.254
Oh, there you are,
Dr. Alver.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.223
You have an insemination
 in seven and a pap in eight.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.225
I got it.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 She does not "got it."

00:24.258 --> 00:26.094
Are you ready
for your insemination?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.761
Hi, yes!

00:27.795 --> 00:29.830
I artificially inseminated
the wrong woman.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.832
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And the father to be?

00:31.865 --> 00:35.069
Rafael Solano, the rich owner
 of the Marbella Hotel.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.605
See, Rafael had cancer

00:37.638 --> 00:40.308
so it was his very last sperm
 sample... or so he thought.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.809
But guess what happened?

00:41.842 --> 00:44.112
Jane and Rafael,
 they fell in love.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.147
So, Jane broke up with Michael.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.249
And Rafael broke up with Petra.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.219
Until Rafael started spiraling
 and broke up with Jane...

00:51.252 --> 00:53.754
which for the record,
 he really regrets.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.689
Also full of regrets?
 Petra.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.259
See, she owns
 part of Rafael's hotel,

00:58.292 --> 01:00.628
but she doesn't have
 the one thing she really wants.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.496
Rafael.
 So, when this happened...

01:02.530 --> 01:03.697
DIANE:
Your husband's sperm sample

01:03.731 --> 01:05.498
was split into two vials.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.535
One was misplaced.
We just found it.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.770
...she naturally took it
 herself.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.206
I know, straight out
 of a telenovela, right?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.342
Well, imagine this--

01:14.375 --> 01:16.677
Jane's father was
 international telenovela star

01:16.710 --> 01:18.746
Rogelio de la Vega.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.215
And he reconnected
 with her mother Xiomara.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.184
And remember Detective Michael?

01:23.217 --> 01:24.652
Well, he was on the hunt

01:24.685 --> 01:26.854
for Sin Rostro,
 a notorious crime boss

01:26.887 --> 01:29.757
who ran a plastic surgery ring,
 changing criminals' faces.

01:29.790 --> 01:33.194
And Sin Rostro turned out to be
 Rafael's stepmother Rose.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.829
And she disappeared and who
 knows what she looks like now?

01:35.863 --> 01:38.699
(whistling)
 I know, OMG, right?

01:38.732 --> 01:40.368
And speaking of OMG,

01:40.401 --> 01:41.735
Jane had her baby.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.171
A beautiful boy named Mateo,

01:43.204 --> 01:44.872
and then, this happened...

01:44.905 --> 01:46.774
Bye, Mateo.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.545
(whistling)

01:51.579 --> 01:53.814
Which, I'm afraid,
 is where we left off.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.749
(tires squealing)

02:09.663 --> 02:11.599
To give some context,

02:11.632 --> 02:13.267
last night's episode
 of The Miracles of Mariana

02:13.301 --> 02:16.304
ended with quite
 the frightening cliffhanger.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.777
JANE:
Yeah, but,

02:23.811 --> 02:26.314
I just don't know if I can
stomach all the ups and downs.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.548
Then don't watch.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.849
Of course I'm watching.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.485
(theme song playing)

02:31.519 --> 02:32.553
Did you make me...?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.821
Turn it up, Ma.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.389
(shushes)
(speaks Spanish)

03:06.487 --> 03:08.456
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Jane would think about

03:08.489 --> 03:10.791
that theme song briefly
 when she was told

03:10.824 --> 03:13.961
the worst news ever.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.264
But that hasn't happened yet.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.965
You see, we're only...

03:23.003 --> 03:24.972
JANE:
Definitely not that one.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.340
Wait, what's wrong
with this one?

03:26.374 --> 03:27.741
Well, he's got a hat on.

03:27.775 --> 03:28.876
We got to send one out
that shows his hair.

03:28.909 --> 03:29.877
He's known for his hair.

03:29.910 --> 03:30.944
He's known for his hair?

03:30.978 --> 03:32.413
Well, he will
be when we

03:32.446 --> 03:33.814
send out the birth
announcement.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.483
Hey, what are you two
doing over there?

03:35.516 --> 03:37.585
Nothing.
I agree.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.254
Just discussing their drunken
 wedding night in Vegas.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.923
Where's Mateo?
Matelio.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.426
How long's
the hearing test take anyway?

03:45.459 --> 03:46.994
He's only been gone
nine minutes.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.296
You timed it?

03:48.329 --> 03:49.630
We're on a nursing
schedule.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.764
You have to keep track.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.500
When he eats,
which boob,

03:52.533 --> 03:53.801
how long?

03:53.834 --> 03:54.802
Mom, it's helpful.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.270
Hey, there.
Hi.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.005
I'm here to take Mateo
for his hearing test.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.307
Oh, another nurse took him.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.008
Really? Who?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.610
Helen, her name was.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.779
There's no nurse
in maternity named Helen.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.787
It should be noted
 that moments before

04:13.821 --> 04:16.023
getting the call that
 would change everything,

04:16.055 --> 04:18.459
Michael was feeling...
 well, I'll be honest--

04:18.492 --> 04:20.793
a little blue.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.363
You okay, buddy?

04:22.396 --> 04:24.565
Oh, yeah.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.999
Just, uh, I don't know,

04:26.033 --> 04:28.402
a little blue.
(chuckles)

04:28.436 --> 04:29.970
Yeah. Me, too.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.039
I got passed over
for a promotion.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.607
Again.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.444
Ah, that sucks.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.912
My ex-fiancée was,
uh, accidentally

04:38.946 --> 04:40.781
artificially inseminated
with the sperm

04:40.814 --> 04:43.083
of this rich hotel owner,
who she just happened

04:43.116 --> 04:44.918
to have a crush on
in high school.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.421
And they had their
baby tonight, so...

04:48.689 --> 04:51.392
Wow. You win.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.761
(cell phone rings)

04:53.794 --> 04:55.329
Hello.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.997
ROSE:
Hello, Detective Cordero.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.100
Rose?

05:00.133 --> 05:03.036
Or Sin Rostro.

05:03.070 --> 05:06.006
(chuckles): I always did love
a good play on words.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.475
Why are you calling?

05:07.508 --> 05:09.510
Because I have
something you want.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.878
I want answers!
That's what I want!

05:10.911 --> 05:12.580
Where is our son?!
We don't know.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.515
The baby's
not in the hospital.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.049
And I've just got word
that surveillance tapes

05:16.083 --> 05:18.552
show the woman, the
one Jane described...

05:18.586 --> 05:20.454
According to his chart,
he hasn't had his hearing test.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.789
Oh, it was a full house earlier.
I'm sorry.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.591
No problem.
I'll take him.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.758
...she's on surveillance
leaving the building.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.427
We've called the police

05:26.460 --> 05:27.561
and we've issued
 an AMBER Alert.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.029
ROGELIO:
I'll retweet it.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.131
XIOMARA:
Jane, honey?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.566
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here now,

05:32.600 --> 05:34.502
to that moment I mentioned,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.404
when Jane wished
 for a theme song.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.439
Something to tell her
 it would be all right.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.641
But there wasn't a theme song.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.075
There was only...

05:42.109 --> 05:44.712
(cell phone ringing)

05:47.180 --> 05:48.882
Michael?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.050
Hey.
Michael, someone took him.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.619
Someone took Mateo.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.986
Jane, I-I need you to listen
to me for a second.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.555
Are you listening?
What is happening?

05:54.588 --> 05:57.591
Jane, listen, I need you
to clear out the room.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.126
I know who has Mateo
and I know how to get him back.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.928
(gasping)

06:05.699 --> 06:06.734
Wait, Rose?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.702
I don't understand.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.970
What does she want?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.672
ROSE:
Let's call it a trade.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.407
I had a dragonfly broach.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.679
Luisa took it
 when we last saw each other.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.615
(moaning)

06:21.649 --> 06:23.817
And it was of real value.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.987
Apparently, it was logged into
evidence at your police station.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.190
Get it out
and I'll give you Mateo.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.592
RAFAEL:
Do the police even do that?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.160
Do they make trades?
It doesn't matter.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.696
This can't be official.
She said just me.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.997
What?!
Look,
following her instructions

06:37.030 --> 06:38.766
is the quickest,
safest way to get Mateo back.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.100
And that is all I want.

06:41.669 --> 06:42.936
You know that's all I want.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.639
I trust him, please.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.842
Fine, but I am going with you.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.444
Okay.
Me, too!

06:51.679 --> 06:52.713
Wait, what?

06:52.746 --> 06:53.747
No, you just gave birth.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.182
Yeah, exactly.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.717
I'm his mother.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.552
And I have to feed
him in 92 minutes.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.554
So I'm not gonna just
sit here and wait.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.823
I'm going. End of story.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.925
(theme song playing)

07:04.958 --> 07:07.695
I'm just gonna need
a hand out of bed.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.697
Grab those wipes.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.665
And-and grab that burp cloth.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.133
Oh, and I need pants.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.936
Hey, can you grab me
that bag of, um,

07:15.969 --> 07:18.639
adult diapers?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.708
All right, let's go!

07:20.741 --> 07:22.743
(groaning)

07:31.685 --> 07:33.521
81 minutes;
Mateo has to eat in 81 minutes.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.056
Just answer me--
did you take the pin?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.191
You don't have it?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.727
You're not gonna
get in trouble.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.228
Did you take the pin?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.663
We'll be right there.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.697
Wait,
where are we going?

07:43.731 --> 07:44.765
Who has it?
Your sister.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.966
Luisa?!
(gasps)

07:45.999 --> 07:47.701
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 No, not Luisa!

07:47.735 --> 07:50.170
RAFAEL:
Luisa, calm down.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.244
Ah, who am I kidding?

07:59.780 --> 08:01.615
Where is the pin?

08:01.649 --> 08:04.652
I w-went to get it

08:04.685 --> 08:06.687
and...

08:15.829 --> 08:18.265
What's that, babe?

08:23.804 --> 08:25.005
Oh, nothing.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.273
The police just wanted

08:26.306 --> 08:27.841
something to do with Rose.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.877
Your ex-girlfriend?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.745
Um, it's some, like,
evidence thing.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.715
You kept a box
of her stuff?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.650
No!

08:36.683 --> 08:37.851
Okay, yeah, but...

08:37.885 --> 08:39.620
They-they were
just cataloging so much,

08:39.653 --> 08:40.688
I didn't think
that they would miss it.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.722
You saved things from your

08:41.755 --> 08:42.956
psychopath ex-girlfriend?!

08:42.990 --> 08:44.725
Okay, first of all,
she's not a psychopath.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.794
She's a sociopath.
Oh, my God!

08:46.827 --> 08:49.129
You're still hung up on her!
No, Juicy, I swear, I'm not.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.631
I'm really not.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.799
Will you just please
give that back?

08:51.832 --> 08:53.100
No! No friggin' way!

08:53.133 --> 08:54.101
Juicy! Juicy!
No!

08:54.134 --> 08:55.268
Wait!

08:55.302 --> 08:57.137
No!

09:02.309 --> 09:03.343
Oh, no!

09:03.376 --> 09:04.945
(moaning)

09:04.978 --> 09:07.114
Oh!

09:08.215 --> 09:09.883
(Jane sighs)

09:09.917 --> 09:11.919
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Go. Go!

09:33.073 --> 09:34.775
(gasps)

09:34.808 --> 09:36.910
Guys, I got it!

09:36.944 --> 09:38.812
(grunts)
Come on!

09:38.846 --> 09:40.881
Hurry up and get
out of the pool!

09:40.914 --> 09:42.916
XIOMARA:
 She'll call.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.785
The minute Jane has
him, she'll call.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.086
(phone chimes)

09:46.119 --> 09:47.320
(gasps)

09:47.354 --> 09:49.790
(sighs)
Just Gloria Estefan.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.892
She wants to know
if there's anything she can do.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.815
Give me the baby.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.349
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.218
You remember Nadine, right?

10:25.826 --> 10:28.195
Do you at least understand now
why I went to work for her?

10:28.228 --> 10:30.964
This, this is
what she does, Michael.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.433
She makes it so
that you can't say no.
(baby fusses)

10:33.466 --> 10:35.302
Give me Mateo.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.305
Where's the pin?

10:40.774 --> 10:43.143
Do you even want to know
what's on the chip inside?

10:43.176 --> 10:44.978
No.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.147
All of the faces
Sin Rostro changed--

10:47.180 --> 10:48.849
crime bosses, drug lords.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.284
It's a record of what
they looked like before

10:51.318 --> 10:53.453
and what they look like now.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.323
Still want to trade?

10:56.356 --> 10:57.691
Yes.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.326
Huh.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.461
Rose was right.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.932
See, I wasn't so sure
you would do it.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.970
Oh, my God.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.372
Oh! Go! Run!

11:12.405 --> 11:15.008
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And so, Rafael ran.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.145
(baby fussing)
 And then, even though

11:18.178 --> 11:19.479
she shouldn't have been
 physically able to,

11:19.512 --> 11:22.249
Jane ran, too.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.885
Well, we'll call it running,
 that thing she's doing.

11:24.918 --> 11:28.255
The point is Jane made it
 to her son.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.890
Oh, you're okay.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.125
You're okay. Mommy's here.

11:32.159 --> 11:35.128
Aww, and they all lived

11:35.162 --> 11:37.330
happily ever after.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.266
Well, except for Jane.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.269
And Rafael and Michael.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.271
And things are really
 screwed up with Luisa,

11:44.304 --> 11:47.407
and Xo and Ro, and don't
 get me started on Petra.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.077
Anyway, let's just enjoy
 this moment.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.813
Because it won't last.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.147
It's okay.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.920
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And so,

11:59.953 --> 12:01.789
Mateo Gloriano Rogelio
 Solano Villanueva

12:01.822 --> 12:04.324
had quite a dramatic
 first night,

12:04.357 --> 12:06.960
causing enough worry
 for a lifetime.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.096
So he was gone
142 minutes...

12:09.129 --> 12:10.998
A fact his mother
 would remind him

12:11.031 --> 12:12.766
when, at 16,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.035
he was nearly two hours late
 for his curfew.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.537
...which is only 20 minutes
from when I would have fed him.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.773
But that's the distant future.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.943
Right now, Jane just wanted
 to hear two little words.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.244
He looks great.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.113
He's fine.
Oh!

12:26.146 --> 12:27.380
That's what I was thinking,

12:27.414 --> 12:28.916
but "He looks great"
 works, too.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.117
I'm sorry, I'm just so happy.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.885
DOCTOR:
So let's get him
on the scale, huh?

12:31.919 --> 12:32.953
Okay.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.454
(squeals)

12:34.487 --> 12:36.023
Okay, looks like

12:36.056 --> 12:37.557
he's six pounds and nine ounces.
Wait, what?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.259
He was seven pounds
when he was born.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.128
Why would he lose weight?
Well, it can
actually take babies

12:41.161 --> 12:43.063
up to two weeks to get back up
to their birth weight,

12:43.096 --> 12:45.098
which is why I'm not
too concerned.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.134
Oh, you can get him now.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.471
Okay, so you're not
 too concerned.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.440
Does that mean
that you're a little concerned?

12:53.473 --> 12:54.942
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Observe Jane

12:54.975 --> 12:56.143
trying not to panic.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.946
Well, that's about
ten percent already,

12:58.979 --> 13:00.848
so it's at the outer
limits of normal,

13:00.881 --> 13:02.315
but you're nursing.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.084
So it's likely your milk
just hasn't come in.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.152
Should we get him
a bottle, maybe?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.854
No, I really want nursing
to work.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.022
No, I just mean
in the meantime.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.023
Bottles can get
in the way.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.358
It's a supply
and demand thing.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.160
The more the baby eats,
the more she makes.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.129
Look who was paying attention
in lactation class.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.564
Oh, right,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.532
the one he was too busy
 to come to.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.168
There could also be
nipple confusion.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.170
Mom, now you're just
showing off.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.572
Observe Rafael
 trying to pretend he knows

13:25.605 --> 13:27.941
what nipple confusion is.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.009
It means that Mateo
can get confused

13:29.042 --> 13:30.577
between the bottle
and the breast

13:30.610 --> 13:33.146
and the concern is that
he would prefer the bottle.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.215
Just try to contribute
 something, man.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.150
Not if he's my son.

13:37.184 --> 13:40.187
Ooh, not that.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.088
So, how's the nursing
been going?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.322
I thought okay,

13:42.355 --> 13:43.490
just short.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.925
He falls asleep pretty quickly.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.026
Oh, you have to nip that
in the bud.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.028
Wake him up, wet washcloth

13:48.061 --> 13:49.930
to his cheeks and his feet.
Got it.

13:49.963 --> 13:53.233
Is there anything else
that you can think of off hand?

13:53.266 --> 13:55.068
Maybe we can take
another class together.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.070
Mom, you were rolling your eyes
the entire class.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.271
No, not the whole time.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.973
Let's go. I'm in.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.175
Sounds like a plan.
Let's weigh Mateo again

14:02.209 --> 14:04.244
in the next few days
and see where he's at, okay?

14:04.277 --> 14:07.014
Okay. But you're okay.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.348
ARMSTRONG:
 You know, it's a damn miracle.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.217
A woman changing her mind,

14:10.250 --> 14:11.952
leaving the baby at
a church like that.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.987
Yeah, no kidding.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.189
Anyway, I got to head out.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.490
Yeah, one last thing.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.093
Nadine Hanson's tracker
was disabled last night.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.361
One last thing,

14:21.394 --> 14:23.663
tell Nadine to toss her cell.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.632
Can't help wondering
if someone tipped her off

14:25.665 --> 14:27.200
on our side.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.268
What are you implying?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.070
You were partners.
I have to ask.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.972
I'm the one who planted
that tracker.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.975
You know how important
catching Sin Rostro is to me.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.243
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 This was true,

14:36.276 --> 14:37.644
second only to...

14:37.677 --> 14:40.047
Go home, shower.
I'm just gonna go feed him.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.214
And sleep.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.315
She needs to sleep.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.151
Look, we've got to try

14:44.184 --> 14:46.153
to get back to normal, right?

14:46.186 --> 14:48.188
Yeah, right.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.522
But it didn't feel right.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.291
Mr. Solano.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.530
Hi. Didn't expect
to see you here so soon.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.698
I'm not really here, Scott.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.567
Just wrapping up
some loose ends.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.936
You know, Petra's taking care
of that meeting with the bank.

15:02.970 --> 15:06.073
Gotcha. So should I just
wake her, then, or...?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.141
What?

15:08.175 --> 15:11.278
Ah, yes, Petra.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.985
Petra.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.154
Petra?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You know what?

15:21.188 --> 15:23.256
It's been a while
 since we last saw Petra.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.358
I should catch you up.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.964
Last night, after stealing
 her ex-husband's sperm,

15:30.998 --> 15:33.967
Petra did what any
 reasonable person would do.

15:34.001 --> 15:37.004
She drunk dialed her mother.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.272
After being hung up on
 three times

15:39.306 --> 15:41.975
by the North Miami-Dade
 Women's Correction Institution,

15:42.009 --> 15:45.012
Petra decided to make
 a pro-con list.

16:04.231 --> 16:07.234
Well, there was just the one.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.307
Uh-oh. Beer goggles.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.542
RAFAEL:
Come on, baby,

16:15.575 --> 16:17.477
you know you want me.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.447
Petra!

16:21.814 --> 16:23.216
(sighs)

16:23.250 --> 16:25.318
What is this?

16:25.352 --> 16:27.720
Rafael, wait...
You
and Luisa

16:27.754 --> 16:29.289
have a meeting with the bank
in an hour.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.124
Obviously, I don't want
my sister to talk...

16:31.158 --> 16:32.192
Have you been drinking?

16:32.225 --> 16:35.195
It's been an emotional night.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.197
(clears throat)

16:37.230 --> 16:40.267
How's your son?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.269
He's...

16:42.302 --> 16:44.237
great.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.639
Great.

16:47.807 --> 16:51.078
I have the meeting
under control, okay?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.445
Anything else?

16:52.479 --> 16:53.713
No.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.149
Thank you, Petra.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.586
I'll say this.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.422
The girl's got spunk.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.358
Hey.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.492
Why aren't
you sleeping?

17:06.526 --> 17:09.362
I'm not tired.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.564
What if I hold him?

17:11.598 --> 17:15.034
You think you'll be able
to sleep then?

17:16.336 --> 17:18.238
Yeah.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.272
Mmm.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.448
I'm not tired, Ma.
Ah.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.586
(cries)

17:40.427 --> 17:43.263
(whispers):
 Mi amor.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.501
(sighs)

17:48.535 --> 17:52.339
It's over,
right, Mom?

17:53.340 --> 17:56.143
Yes. It's over.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.378
Totally over.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.381
And so Jane closed her eyes,

18:01.414 --> 18:04.451
and for the first time
 since giving birth,

18:04.484 --> 18:06.619
she slept.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.389
For eight and a half minutes.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.323
(distant clamoring)

18:10.357 --> 18:12.625
Do you hear that?

18:19.232 --> 18:22.669
I think I know
that sound.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.273
(gasps)

18:28.208 --> 18:30.610
(indistinct clamoring)

18:30.643 --> 18:32.445
Whoa...

18:32.479 --> 18:35.648
(clamoring continues)

18:35.682 --> 18:38.518
Okay, so maybe
 it's not totally over.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.793
(clamoring)
ROGELIO:
 I don't understand.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.828
How did this happen?
REPORTER (on TV):
It all began

18:48.861 --> 18:50.430
when international
telenovela star

18:50.463 --> 18:53.833
Rogelio de la Vega retweeted
an AMBER Alert

18:53.866 --> 18:55.835
that his grandchild
was kidnapped.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.306
He then tweeted
the baby's safe return.

19:07.514 --> 19:11.218
From there,
the story got really #Crazy.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.854
See, when you Google the name
Jane Villanueva, this comes up.

19:14.887 --> 19:15.822
Oh, no.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.492
Could this be
 a modern-day miracle?

19:19.526 --> 19:21.661
No!
Yes.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.895
She was a teacher in our school.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.397
And you exploited me!

19:24.431 --> 19:25.832
And we believed in her.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.867
Especially when things
started happening.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.603
Things? What things?
I have
no idea.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.205
We tried to get pregnant
for seven years.

19:33.873 --> 19:34.841
I'm not sure.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.842
And then I hugged Jane.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.344
No...

19:37.377 --> 19:38.711
We're due in three months.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.280
Ever heard of a coincidence,
lady?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.915
Abuela!
(growls)

19:42.949 --> 19:45.252
REPORTER: And it gets stranger.
Apparently, Jane went into labor

19:45.285 --> 19:47.620
on the 125 bus line.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.356
Let's meet the woman
who assisted her,

19:49.389 --> 19:50.590
the angel, Gabriel.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.225
It's Gabrielle.
All right.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.627
Can you tell us anything
about this miraculous ride?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.296
I don't know
if it was miraculous.

19:56.329 --> 19:59.732
Yes, exactly.
Thank you, Gabriel. Gabrielle!

19:59.766 --> 20:01.968
REPORTER:
But some might disagree.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.836
I actually saw the baby.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.606
What the hell?
It should say "Slutty Crystal."

20:06.639 --> 20:09.276
My mistake.
I was coming out
of my car this morning...

20:09.309 --> 20:10.943
Translation: she was
having sweaty car sex

20:10.977 --> 20:12.779
so her mom wouldn't know she
was back with Dumbass Donny.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.780
And Jane was holding the baby,

20:13.813 --> 20:16.416
and, I swear, he had this...

20:16.449 --> 20:17.984
glow.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.819
Okay, okay,
enough, enough!

20:19.852 --> 20:21.554
(sighs)
What am I gonna do?

20:21.588 --> 20:23.956
Jane, I've been dealing
with the press for many years.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.625
Let me help.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.926
Okay.
But first,

20:26.959 --> 20:28.928
do you want to shut it down
or do a tour

20:28.961 --> 20:30.997
of the morning shows
and turn this into a book deal?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.632
Dad, I want to
shut it down.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.267
That's what I assumed.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.569
So we should release
a straightforward statement,

20:36.603 --> 20:38.938
emphasizing the fact
that this was a medical mistake.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.809
(clamoring intensifies)

20:42.842 --> 20:45.912
Oh, good. Rafael's right
 on time for lactation class.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.615
MAN:
Are you the father?!

20:48.648 --> 20:50.617
What the hell
is going on?
It's crazy. Oh!

20:50.650 --> 20:52.785
Oh, my God.
Logan just said we were on TV!
Oh, my gosh!

20:52.819 --> 20:55.555
Oh, hi, Jane.
How are you?
Selfie!

21:03.630 --> 21:05.832
#BabyMateo, #Miracle,
#SecondComing.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.667
You have three
tags trending--

21:07.700 --> 21:09.402
it's outrageous.
ROGELIO: Girls!
Stop it! Enough!

21:09.436 --> 21:10.937
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, girls, stop it.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.672
Okay, come in.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.341
I don't even know how I'll get
out of here to go to the class.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.742
I mean, they'll
probably follow us.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.943
ROGELIO:
They will definitely
follow you.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.378
But don't worry.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.012
I know how to evade
the paparazzi.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.914
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And to give him credit, he did.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.950
Which brings us here.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.354
Hey, Jane.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.388
What's going on?

21:31.958 --> 21:35.928
Well, uh, Mateo falls asleep
when he's nursing.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.064
And he just lost so much weight
in the first day.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.699
Exactly like mine.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.900
It was an issue
with her latch.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.935
Move into the sun
a little bit.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.372
Indirect sunlight is good
for them in the first days.

21:45.405 --> 21:48.007
Oh, okay.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.709
Thank you so much.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.711
I was also
wondering--

21:51.744 --> 21:52.912
does, um, trauma affect
milk supply?

21:52.945 --> 21:54.881
Definitely.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.784
Milk can come in later for
mommies who've had C-sections.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.619
How about mommies
 who've had kidnappings?

21:59.652 --> 22:00.953
Don't worry.

22:00.987 --> 22:01.954
We'll figure it out.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.322
Now, let me see
your breasts.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.392
Hmm.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.626
We're not
shy here.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.561
Oh, no,
me neither.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.030
Okay... then...

22:13.400 --> 22:15.802
Oh, okay.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.737
Yeah.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.971
Huh.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.807
We'll fix it.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.542
Pick up the baby, and
when he opens wide,

22:22.575 --> 22:23.943
I'm gonna stuff your
breast into his mouth

22:23.976 --> 22:25.945
like a hamburger, okay?

22:25.978 --> 22:29.115
Uh, let's give her
 some privacy.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.018
RAFAEL:
Thanks again
for the police escort.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.019
Oh, no problem.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.054
I think that's what Rogelio
thinks I do all day

22:35.087 --> 22:37.824
is drive around celebrities.
(chuckles)

22:37.857 --> 22:39.826
Actually, I'm gonna
wait in the car.
Hey, can I...
can I ask you something?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.661
You know what?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.563
I'm gonna bust in here
 and translate for Michael.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.865
Sure.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.067
How did you deal with
how close they all are?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.036
You know, the
Villanueva women.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.004
Meaning?

22:52.038 --> 22:53.973
I could just kind
of use some advice.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.075
Oh, wow.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.110
It's just I'm having
a hard time finding

22:58.144 --> 23:00.547
that moment to
assert myself.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.618
With the baby, you know?

23:06.686 --> 23:08.655
I mean, it's my kid, too.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.424
And I'm kind of feeling like
it's hard to get in there.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.793
You know?

23:13.826 --> 23:16.028
Okay, a quick rundown
 of Michael's options.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.108
And he chose...

23:29.141 --> 23:31.143
Any other option,
seriously.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.145
I mean, if she would have just
chosen any other option...

23:33.179 --> 23:35.147
I'm sorry.
(scoffs)

23:35.181 --> 23:37.149
Are you actually
blaming the banker

23:37.183 --> 23:38.718
for your behavior
at the meeting?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.152
So can we get you
something to drink?

23:40.186 --> 23:41.621
Just a juice.

23:41.654 --> 23:44.457
Juice.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.058
Juicy.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.795
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble
with my girlfriend.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.830
Okay, we're done here.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.470
Now, on to important stuff.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.138
The sperm.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.042
Scott?
SCOTT: Yeah?

24:03.075 --> 24:05.545
I had a little shopping
bag-- small, blue.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.146
Oh, yeah,
the baby present.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.582
I put it up in Mr. Solano's
penthouse for you.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.784
I believe the words
 you're looking for are,

24:11.818 --> 24:13.119
"Oh, crap."

24:17.757 --> 24:19.792
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.193
You'll recall, we left Petra

24:21.227 --> 24:23.229
on the hunt
 for a metallic canister

24:23.262 --> 24:25.231
filled with her ex-husband's
 last semen sample.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.633
Hello?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.668
Hmm, where could it be?

24:30.803 --> 24:33.172
Ooh, the baby nursery.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.174
(baby crying)

24:35.207 --> 24:37.009
What's wrong?

24:37.043 --> 24:39.979
You just ate, and we
straightened out the latch.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.214
MICHAEL:
Well, there's still
about 25 people out there.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.250
They know if they step
on this property,

24:44.283 --> 24:45.652
I arrest them
for trespassing.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.688
(men chanting)

24:48.721 --> 24:49.856
What is that?

24:54.561 --> 24:55.595
Got to be kidding me.

24:55.628 --> 24:56.963
ROGELIO:
They will go away.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.531
Eventually.

24:58.565 --> 25:01.768
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Things do, after all,

25:01.801 --> 25:04.503
go away.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.144
A cupcake?

25:12.178 --> 25:15.147
I had the OB write
down the sex.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.149
So blue inside,
it's a boy.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.751
Pink, it's a girl.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.186
Really?
Yeah, it's
cheesy, okay?

25:20.219 --> 25:21.287
I know, I'm
hormonal, so I...

25:21.320 --> 25:22.521
Hey.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.257
I love it.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.229
Ready?

25:30.262 --> 25:31.664
Yeah.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.738
Does that look like
blue or pink to you?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.909
It looks...

25:42.942 --> 25:44.210
purple.
Purple.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.244
(laughing)

25:45.277 --> 25:46.746
Great.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.866
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hurry up, Petra.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.901
Wait, why am I rooting for her?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.306
(elevator bell dings)

26:15.675 --> 26:16.676
(shouts)

26:19.178 --> 26:20.179
Petra.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.181
What are you doing here?

26:22.214 --> 26:25.017
I'm looking for
you, actually.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.319
Well, part of you, anyway.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.821
To tell you that your sister
was a disaster in the meeting.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.056
She cried.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.323
My purse, please.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.837
LUISA:
Hey, Raf.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.839
You cried? Seriously?

26:46.873 --> 26:49.241
I needed that loan so I could
afford to buy Petra out.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.677
You knew that.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.078
You knew I've been
doing everything

26:52.111 --> 26:53.312
to try to get her on my side.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.914
Flirting even.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.348
But you are so selfish
that you don't...

26:56.382 --> 26:57.917
Look, I'm sorry.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.251
You know what?

26:59.285 --> 27:02.288
I don't even know
why I'm surprised anymore.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.723
(sighs heavily)

27:03.756 --> 27:05.424
Hey.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.026
You okay?

27:07.059 --> 27:10.129
You know me so well.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.331
Yeah, plus you were
sighing pretty loud, so...

27:12.364 --> 27:14.366
I did this.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.836
I brought the paparazzi
upon her, Michael.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.839
If I hadn't retweeted
that AMBER Alert...

27:19.872 --> 27:21.273
I never thought I'd feel

27:21.307 --> 27:23.676
anything but #Blessed
to be famous.

27:23.710 --> 27:27.013
But now I'm feeling #Cursed.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.850
From my standpoint...

27:30.883 --> 27:32.852
As resident Villanueva expert?

27:32.885 --> 27:35.855
...as a cop, you did
everything right.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.857
Nine out of ten times,

27:37.890 --> 27:40.026
that AMBER Alert would
have really helped us out.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.028
But I just feel
so impotent, Michael.

27:42.061 --> 27:45.331
Not in a sexual way,
but in a paternal way.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.734
Yeah, yeah.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.802
That kind of makes
sense, you know?

27:49.836 --> 27:52.238
Is it like-- Jane's
going through so much,

27:52.271 --> 27:54.006
you just don't know
how to help her?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.407
Exactly.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.843
In the last 24 hours,

27:56.876 --> 27:58.845
I have ruined multiple
celebrity friendships

27:58.878 --> 28:00.246
by tweeting
their dirty secrets

28:00.279 --> 28:02.248
in an effort
to distract the press.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.216
It has not worked.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.385
You know what,
no more tweeting.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.387
'Cause tweeting is not
gonna help Jane right now.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.389
So think smaller.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.792
Less celebrity stuff,
more grandfather...

28:12.825 --> 28:13.793
(groans)

28:13.826 --> 28:15.261
Abuelo.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.930
Do you have a name in mind?

28:17.964 --> 28:20.332
Papa.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.002
Nice, ambiguous.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.436
Nice.

28:24.470 --> 28:27.406
Okay, so think Papa stuff.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.043
Oh, okay.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.480
Okay.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.115
All right, okay.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.119
XIOMARA:
He's eating again?

28:40.152 --> 28:42.421
Yeah, he must not
have gotten enough.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.156
Why don't we just
give him one bottle?

28:44.190 --> 28:46.258
No, I don't want to.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.094
But, baby, you're exhausted.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.495
You haven't slept
in 48 hours.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.130
I'm his mom.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.099
I have to stay strong.

28:53.132 --> 28:56.836
Mothers don't always
have to be strong.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.307
Hon.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.344
I'm sorry.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.947
Just think I'm a
little overwhelmed.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.049
And I'd be okay,
if I knew it was working,

29:10.082 --> 29:13.385
but he just keeps crying,
like he's hungry.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.788
Look, I get all the great
reasons to nurse,

29:15.822 --> 29:17.089
but if it isn't working...

29:17.123 --> 29:19.191
But I have to
make it work.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.060
It can't be my trauma
getting in the way.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.363
Why?
Because what happened
is my fault.

29:24.396 --> 29:28.267
I mean, my maternal instincts,
where were they?

29:28.300 --> 29:30.136
I just gave him
to the nurse.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.403
Baby...

29:31.437 --> 29:33.806
she was wearing a uniform.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.407
She said he needed
a hearing test.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.944
But I should've known.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.913
And I didn't.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.916
And I know
it doesn't make sense,

29:43.950 --> 29:46.953
but I just want to be able
to do this for him.

29:46.986 --> 29:50.422
I just want to be able
to do this one good thing.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.825
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And even though Xo agreed,

29:52.859 --> 29:54.894
it really didn't
 make any sense,

29:54.927 --> 29:57.596
she too wanted to do something
 good for her child.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.465
How can I help?

30:01.533 --> 30:03.335
When he opens his mouth,

30:03.369 --> 30:06.405
will you stuff my boob in it
like it's a hamburger?

30:06.438 --> 30:08.574
Honey, I am all over it.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.844
And it should be noted,
 she was.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.412
(baby crying)
 And then she was again.

30:13.445 --> 30:16.115
And... stuff.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.316
And yet... again.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.418
And stuff.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.487
RAFAEL:
 Is everything okay?

30:21.520 --> 30:23.089
We don't know.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.423
He's nursing
every 30 minutes.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.025
I must be doing
something wrong.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.426
Maybe he's cluster feeding.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.362
Which brings us back, here.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.433
Come on,
 did you doubt Michael?

30:34.466 --> 30:35.968
He's a mensch.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.104
Get a book and read it

30:38.137 --> 30:39.538
so you know
what you're talking about.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.440
Then wait for the right moment,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.976
when she doesn't know
and her mom doesn't know,

30:44.010 --> 30:45.511
and even Abuela is stumped,

30:45.544 --> 30:48.514
that's when you come in
with the save.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.482
Cluster feeding.
Uh, it's like when a baby eats

30:50.516 --> 30:52.618
and eats before the mature milk
comes in.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.254
I read it here.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.533
My milk is coming in.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.402
Oh, my God,
my milk is coming in!

31:10.436 --> 31:12.571
(laughing)
Your milk is coming in!

31:17.576 --> 31:18.577
Nice work.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.380
Yes. Family fist bump.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.514
Family fist bump.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.555
Look who's cluster feeding?

31:29.588 --> 31:32.258
Yeah? And pooping.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.194
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Papa time.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.929
I insist on changing
his diaper.

31:36.963 --> 31:39.265
I just need someone to tell me
exactly how to do it.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.566
I'll help.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.335
Thanks, Dad.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.404
Oh...

31:47.273 --> 31:49.341
His first smile.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.178
Oh, how sweet...

31:52.211 --> 31:54.280
the way that none of them
 told him it was just gas.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.415
Okay, so I should take off.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.583
Uh, wait.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.285
I just wanted to thank you.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.320
You know,
for your advice earlier.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.355
Aw, he's a mensch, too.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.991
No problem.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.226
What advise?

32:07.259 --> 32:08.660
I was just having
a little trouble

32:08.694 --> 32:11.263
figuring out my place,
you know, with your family.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.132
Oh?

32:13.165 --> 32:14.700
It's just, you guys
are all so close, you know?

32:14.733 --> 32:16.402
No, I get that.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.037
RAFAEL: And I know we
are trying to get back

32:18.070 --> 32:20.406
to normal, but it's
not normal what happened.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.241
Yeah, you're right.
And plus, we didn't even

32:22.274 --> 32:23.976
discuss what our normal would be
and even if we did,

32:24.010 --> 32:25.577
I don't know if it
would count, because

32:25.611 --> 32:28.447
how do you know how you feel
unless you're here?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.416
How do you feel?

32:30.449 --> 32:32.384
Like I don't want
to be away from Mateo.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.987
So, do you want to stay over?

32:35.021 --> 32:37.356
Like, for... like the
first couple weeks?

32:37.389 --> 32:39.291
Wow.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.693
I was angling for, like,
a 6:00 a.m. in, 11:00 p.m. out.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.562
What?
Yes.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.397
Great.
Great.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.466
Dude, options two and three

32:47.499 --> 32:49.168
were just sitting there.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.602
(phone swooshes)

32:50.636 --> 32:54.306
Oh, I, uh, still have
Rogelio's phone.

32:56.408 --> 32:57.576
What?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.413
Someone tweeted a photo.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.482
Oh, God, of Mateo?

33:03.515 --> 33:05.284
WOMAN:
 Move into the sun a little bit.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.187
Indirect sunlight is good
for them in the first days.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.389
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Let it be known that any doubts
 about her maternal instincts

33:10.422 --> 33:12.558
shattered at this moment,
 and Jane had one thought

33:12.591 --> 33:14.560
and one thought only.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.395
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Jane, where are you going?

33:16.428 --> 33:17.363
To shut this down.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.364
Wait, how?

33:18.397 --> 33:20.732
I have no idea.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.434
(crowd clamoring)

33:22.468 --> 33:24.370
And that's when it hit her--

33:24.403 --> 33:26.405
a beam of divine inspiration.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.640
Okay, honestly, the beam
 was just a reflection

33:28.674 --> 33:31.477
coming off
 Slutty Crystal's compact,

33:31.510 --> 33:34.246
but was that just luck
 or divine providence?

33:34.280 --> 33:36.248
Well, that's for theologians
 to debate.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.717
But the fact remained that
 if her makeup wasn't smudged

33:38.750 --> 33:40.519
from sweaty car sex,

33:40.552 --> 33:42.521
Crystal wouldn't
 have had to fix it.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.690
And the light
 wouldn't have shown,

33:44.723 --> 33:47.293
providing the answer
 to Jane's problem.

33:51.497 --> 33:52.331
Jane, hello.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.432
Sister Margaret?

33:53.465 --> 33:55.201
Here's the thing.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.303
I didn't want
to come out here before,

33:57.336 --> 33:59.771
'cause the truth is

33:59.805 --> 34:02.074
I've had sex.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.475
A lot.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.211
In cars even.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.279
I just didn't want my grandma
to know, but with all this,

34:07.313 --> 34:08.647
I decided to tell her the truth.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.581
So, now I'm telling you.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.484
I don't believe you.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.819
Well, it's true.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.121
And regardless,

34:15.154 --> 34:16.487
do you want to be involved

34:16.522 --> 34:17.523
in a public debate
about my virginity?

34:17.556 --> 34:21.360
I mean, doesn't
that sound archaic?

34:21.393 --> 34:23.094
What?

34:27.666 --> 34:29.501
Oh, my God!

34:29.534 --> 34:31.437
I'm leaking milk!

34:31.469 --> 34:34.473
Actually leaking!

34:34.505 --> 34:37.243
You want to see a miracle?

34:37.275 --> 34:40.246
This is a friggin' miracle!

34:42.281 --> 34:44.216
(whoops)
Look at this!

34:44.250 --> 34:45.516
Look at this!

34:45.551 --> 34:46.552
PETRA:
 It's really over.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.155
And I don't want it to be.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.857
And I, I just, I feel like...

34:51.889 --> 34:53.525
I don't know,
I think, I think

34:53.559 --> 34:55.161
maybe I just feel
a little lonely.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.527
You know?

34:56.562 --> 34:58.397
I am so sorry, sweetheart,

34:58.430 --> 35:00.599
that things are
so difficult for you.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.744
Mm, that's life.

35:12.778 --> 35:16.148
At times, you have to let go
of the peoples you love.

35:16.182 --> 35:18.184
Now, do the reasonable thing.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.819
Sell Rafael's sperm back to him.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.488
I'm not selling it, Mother.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.722
Your choice.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.557
Just move on.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.293
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which for the record,

35:27.326 --> 35:29.661
she was trying to do when...

35:29.695 --> 35:31.497
Hey, I want to schedule

35:31.530 --> 35:33.332
a makeup meeting
with the bankers.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.666
My brother's mad at me
and I just...

35:34.700 --> 35:36.935
You okay?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.805
Please, stop pretending
to my friend, Luisa.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.607
I heard you

35:41.640 --> 35:43.642
the other night
talking to Rafael, okay?

35:43.675 --> 35:45.444
I mean, I feel a little bad

35:45.477 --> 35:46.645
about manipulating Petra,

35:46.678 --> 35:48.780
but I have a family now

35:48.814 --> 35:50.682
with Jane.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.684
And you walked away?

35:52.718 --> 35:54.453
Yes, of course, I walked away.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.322
And was it divine providence
 that these two

35:56.355 --> 35:57.923
met at this moment...

35:57.956 --> 35:59.658
Then you missed Raf saying
how he had no choice.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.660
Jane insisted.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.695
...when Luisa was determined
 to find some way

36:03.729 --> 36:06.365
to help her brother
 with his Petra situation.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.899
And then, I asked him,
point blank--

36:07.933 --> 36:09.768
if all things were even
who he wished he was with.

36:09.801 --> 36:13.239
What did he say?

36:13.272 --> 36:14.906
Well again, that's for
 theologians to debate.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.608
But the fact remains--

36:16.642 --> 36:18.744
the following events
 did exactly transpire.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.779
He got mad at me, actually.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.749
Because if I hadn't screwed up
in the first place,

36:23.782 --> 36:26.685
then none of this would be
happening, which... it's true.

36:26.718 --> 36:30.356
I mean,
that should have been your baby.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.493
Thank you.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.428
What?
The baker says
it's a boy!

36:36.462 --> 36:37.896
It's a boy?
It's a boy.

36:37.929 --> 36:40.299
It's a boy?!
(laughing)

36:41.533 --> 36:43.635
You're right.

36:43.669 --> 36:46.338
It should have been my baby.

36:46.372 --> 36:50.276
To be fair: Luisa didn't know
 Petra had Rafael's sperm.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.644
There's still a chance
with you and Raf.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.946
I swear.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.948
And so it was

36:56.982 --> 36:58.984
that after
 a quick Google search,

36:59.017 --> 37:02.488
and some pointers
 from fertilitygoddess1345...

37:02.521 --> 37:04.690
(doorbell rings)

37:06.458 --> 37:09.261
A sandwich and the
extra turkey baster?

37:09.295 --> 37:10.696
Perfect. Thank you.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.700
...Petra decideth...

37:14.733 --> 37:17.636
to go for it.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.238
*

37:28.747 --> 37:30.716
DOCTOR:
Okay, it looks like
Mateo is...

37:30.749 --> 37:32.551
seven pounds
and two ounces.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.985
What?!

37:34.019 --> 37:35.821
That's better
than before.
(laughing)

37:35.854 --> 37:37.456
We hug now, right?

37:37.489 --> 37:39.558
Yes.
(sighs)

37:39.591 --> 37:41.427
And I'm impressed.
Good job.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.861
(happy squeal)
Go-go tell your mom.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.530
Okay.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.565
Better than before?

37:46.598 --> 37:48.434
Yes! Okay,
I'm going back in.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.838
(laughs)
(panting)

37:52.871 --> 37:55.474
(sighs, panting)

37:58.777 --> 38:00.646
Yeah, I think
I'm just overwhelmed.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.914
Mm.
(sighs)

38:09.955 --> 38:12.658
I've just been
so worried about her.

38:19.565 --> 38:22.668
So... I think there's something

38:22.701 --> 38:24.703
I should tell you and Jane...

38:24.736 --> 38:27.973
now that everything's okay.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.742
By the power vested in me
by the state of Nevada

38:30.776 --> 38:33.845
and the goddess Cher,
who is with us here in spirit,

38:33.879 --> 38:35.947
I now pronounce you man
and wife.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.649
(applause and cheering)

38:37.683 --> 38:40.752
You got married?
By a Cher impersonator?

38:40.786 --> 38:43.622
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 * Oh, if they could
 turn back time. *

38:43.655 --> 38:45.357
It was obviously
a mistake.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.793
We're getting
it annulled.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.399
Abuela!
Ma!

38:53.432 --> 38:55.967
(laughing)
 ¿Qué?

38:56.001 --> 38:58.470
(laughter)

38:59.738 --> 39:01.006
Morning, boss.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.674
It's not a good time, Scott.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.510
Oh, I'll be quick.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.378
I just wanted to
discuss the fact

39:06.412 --> 39:08.480
that you stole
Mr. Solano's sperm?

39:08.514 --> 39:10.048
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, Petra.

39:10.081 --> 39:13.118
You thought
 you got off scot-free.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.003
(smacks his lips)

39:33.171 --> 39:35.774
Home, huh?

39:35.807 --> 39:37.509
Just wanted to make sure

39:37.543 --> 39:39.978
there were no more
crazy people around.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.548
Mm-hmm.

39:42.581 --> 39:46.985
You know, I haven't had a
chance to say thank you.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.823
For... I don't know.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.792
How do you say...
 for everything?

39:53.825 --> 39:55.527
For everything.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.463
Oh, of course.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.997
You know... anything.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.866
All in a day's work

40:00.899 --> 40:02.834
for our Villanueva
 family advisor.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.136
So, you know Rafael's
staying over.
Oh, I know.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.539
No, but, like, just
as the baby's father.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.808
Huh? You don't tell that
 to an advisor.

40:09.841 --> 40:13.044
That was weird. I don't even
know why I'm telling you that.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.614
But Michael knew exactly why.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.023
No.

40:25.056 --> 40:28.760
I just wanted to try some
skin-to-skin contact.

40:28.794 --> 40:29.995
What?

40:30.028 --> 40:32.531
Well, it helps babies bond
with their dads.

40:32.564 --> 40:33.999
It's, uh, chapter
12 in the book.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.734
Oh, right. Yeah.
Yeah, I read that.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.135
It was a really cool chapter.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.806
So I should probably
go to sleep.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.141
I have to be up in, um...

40:43.174 --> 40:45.243
121 minutes.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.812
(laughs)
Okay.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.246
Good night.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.882
Night.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.723
(baby coos softly)

41:04.796 --> 41:07.599
This is a little weird.

41:07.633 --> 41:10.602
Yeah, but it was always
gonna be weird.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.037
True.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.105
And it's actually kind of...

41:14.139 --> 41:16.207

41:16.241 --> 41:18.009

41:18.043 --> 41:20.912

41:22.748 --> 41:25.083
And so it was.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.553

41:29.755 --> 41:32.490
