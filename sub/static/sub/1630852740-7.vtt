06:56.209 --> 06:58.250
When my husband saw me, he said,

06:58.250 --> 07:01.180
What did you do?

06:58.250 --> 07:01.180
You look different.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.180
And I was just

07:01.180 --> 07:03.180
smiling and saying,

07:03.180 --> 07:06.110
No, I didnt do nothing.

07:03.180 --> 07:06.110
I was just working out.

07:07.290 --> 07:11.139
But then, 2014 I starting

07:07.290 --> 07:11.139
feeling this,

07:11.139 --> 07:13.040
it felt like pebbles.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.180
Sitting down, it was

07:13.040 --> 07:16.180
uncomfortable. It pinched me.

07:16.180 --> 07:18.259
And thats when

07:16.180 --> 07:18.259
I told my husband.

07:18.259 --> 07:20.209
My husband is freaking out.

07:20.209 --> 07:23.139
What, but when did

07:20.209 --> 07:23.139
you did the fat transfer?

07:23.139 --> 07:25.000
"You never told me about this.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.189
So, I go to Colombia

07:25.000 --> 07:27.189
and I go see this doctor.

07:27.189 --> 07:30.230
He said that in

07:27.189 --> 07:30.230
fact that it was silicone,

07:30.230 --> 07:33.139
and on the MRI its

07:30.230 --> 07:33.139
showing its all over my butt.

07:33.139 --> 07:34.250
What did he tell you?

07:34.250 --> 07:37.029
We had to take

07:34.250 --> 07:37.029
it out immediately.

07:37.029 --> 07:39.180
Hes saying Youre lucky,

07:37.029 --> 07:39.180
this could kill you.

07:39.180 --> 07:42.000
You dont want to

07:39.180 --> 07:42.000
mess with injected silicone.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.170
It can cause

07:42.000 --> 07:45.170
massive recurrent bumps,

07:45.170 --> 07:47.259
lumps called

07:45.170 --> 07:47.259
granulomas. When that happens,

07:47.259 --> 07:49.250
this could damage the tissue.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.189
It could get in

07:49.250 --> 07:51.189
your blood supply.

07:51.189 --> 07:53.250
It can cause

07:51.189 --> 07:53.250
a clot. It can kill you.

07:53.250 --> 07:57.139
I go in surgery

07:53.250 --> 07:57.139
about three days later.

07:57.139 --> 07:59.129
So, hes making a big incision,

07:59.129 --> 08:02.180
one side to the other and then

07:59.129 --> 08:02.180
hes taking all the fat.

08:02.180 --> 08:04.240
Removing fat

08:02.180 --> 08:04.240
with silicone in it.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.149
Youre right. I come

08:04.240 --> 08:07.149
out from surgery, Im shocked.

08:07.149 --> 08:09.160
So, he took your buttocks away.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.089
Completely, he removed it.

08:11.089 --> 08:13.290
He mutilated me. He said,

08:11.089 --> 08:13.290
Wait about six months

08:13.290 --> 08:16.139
to a year and youre

08:13.290 --> 08:16.139
going to have to come back,

08:16.139 --> 08:18.029
and well do

08:16.139 --> 08:18.029
our reconstruction.

08:18.029 --> 08:20.089
I didnt have

08:18.029 --> 08:20.089
enough fat. I was very slim.

08:20.089 --> 08:23.009
He said, Were going

08:20.089 --> 08:23.009
to have to go with implants.

08:23.009 --> 08:26.189
It was horrible.

08:23.009 --> 08:26.189
Implants were towards my side.

08:26.189 --> 08:29.220
Theyre not in the middle

08:26.189 --> 08:29.220
where theyre supposed to be.

08:29.220 --> 08:31.209
-I didnt see no projection.

08:29.220 --> 08:31.209
-Right.

08:31.209 --> 08:34.240
I feel like I was,

08:31.209 --> 08:34.240
Im still deformed.

08:34.240 --> 08:38.059
Not only did this

08:34.240 --> 08:38.059
change my life basically,

08:38.059 --> 08:41.179
but my husband and I are

08:38.059 --> 08:41.179
now thinking of separating.

08:41.179 --> 08:43.210
He has lost all trust in me

08:43.210 --> 08:46.220
and I dont think hell

08:43.210 --> 08:46.220
ever forgive me for what I did,

08:46.220 --> 08:49.039
but now I feel very

08:46.220 --> 08:49.039
disappointed in myself.

08:49.039 --> 08:52.289
Feel ashamed, and guilty.

08:52.289 --> 08:55.059
To be honest with you,

08:52.289 --> 08:55.059
your problem is challenging.

08:55.059 --> 08:57.049
Theres no doubt

08:55.059 --> 08:57.049
the implants have to come out,

08:57.049 --> 08:59.159
but in a way if

08:57.049 --> 08:59.159
we take them out,

08:59.159 --> 09:01.269
it kind of makes the whole

08:59.159 --> 09:01.269
thing even more deflated

09:01.269 --> 09:03.179
and more difficult to fix,

09:03.179 --> 09:06.059
and then the natural

09:03.179 --> 09:06.059
question to ask is, well,

09:06.059 --> 09:07.269
what can we put in there?

09:07.269 --> 09:10.009
I dont want any

09:07.269 --> 09:10.009
more implants in my body.

09:10.009 --> 09:15.019
This is a very tricky

09:10.009 --> 09:15.019
problem. Im thinking to myself,

09:15.019 --> 09:16.240
I dont even

09:15.019 --> 09:16.240
want to examine her.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.279
I just want to tell

09:16.240 --> 09:18.279
her I cant help her now.

09:18.279 --> 09:21.029
No, Dr. Dubrow.

09:21.029 --> 09:24.190
I just feel horrible.

09:24.190 --> 09:28.269
Baby one and baby two here.

09:24.190 --> 09:28.269
Whos more high maintenance?

09:28.269 --> 09:32.070
This one in your arms, or

09:28.269 --> 09:32.070
this one? I know its this one.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.029
Waah!

09:34.029 --> 09:35.250
Lumpy nose thing

09:34.029 --> 09:35.250
doesnt really work for me.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.039
The skin shrink

09:35.250 --> 09:38.039
wraps are in the cartilage

09:38.039 --> 09:39.240
and makes it look like this,

09:39.240 --> 09:44.240
and to try to fix

09:39.240 --> 09:44.240
it is really hard to do.

09:52.070 --> 09:54.240
I just hope

09:52.070 --> 09:54.240
he thinks of something.

09:54.240 --> 09:58.080
After hearing Dr. Dubrow

09:54.240 --> 09:58.080
say that theres not much

09:58.080 --> 10:02.149
he can do for me,

09:58.080 --> 10:02.149
Im very sad. Im very hopeless.

10:02.149 --> 10:05.279
Now, Im really feeling

10:02.149 --> 10:05.279
like nothing is going to happen.

10:05.279 --> 10:07.250
Okay, so the implants.

10:07.250 --> 10:09.250
Oh my gosh,

10:07.250 --> 10:09.250
the implants are right there.

10:09.250 --> 10:12.019
Im hoping that

10:09.250 --> 10:12.019
on the physical exam

10:12.019 --> 10:15.210
I can find something

10:12.019 --> 10:15.210
I can hang my surgical hat on.

10:15.210 --> 10:18.090
So, I can give her some kind of

10:18.090 --> 10:20.169
normal cosmetic appearance.

10:20.169 --> 10:23.289
Anything,

10:20.169 --> 10:23.289
Im just looking for something.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.169
Over the years,

10:23.289 --> 10:26.169
Ive come up with an operation

10:26.169 --> 10:29.159
that I have used

10:26.169 --> 10:29.159
successfully a few times,

10:29.159 --> 10:33.000
and Ive been able

10:29.159 --> 10:33.000
to rotate love handle fat

10:33.000 --> 10:36.039
down into

10:33.000 --> 10:36.039
the pocket and give some volume.

10:36.039 --> 10:38.240
When I felt those spots,

10:36.039 --> 10:38.240
I do feel something

10:38.240 --> 10:41.259
but at most its a maybe.

10:41.259 --> 10:45.220
I may open it up and go,

10:41.259 --> 10:45.220
Oh, thats not usable.

10:45.220 --> 10:48.269
Or maybe theres silicone in it.

10:48.269 --> 10:50.200
If I was forced

10:48.269 --> 10:50.200
to give you a chance

10:50.200 --> 10:52.159
that this could be

10:50.200 --> 10:52.159
fixable cosmetically,

10:52.159 --> 10:56.049
it could vary

10:52.159 --> 10:56.049
anywhere between 5% chance

10:56.049 --> 11:02.210
and 25% chance. Low,

10:56.049 --> 11:02.210
but theres a chance.

11:02.210 --> 11:09.179
Lets hope. Yes, please.

11:12.190 --> 11:15.269
Im so ready to

11:12.190 --> 11:15.269
get this over with.

11:15.269 --> 11:19.059
And if you cant help me,

11:15.269 --> 11:19.059
at least you tried,

11:19.059 --> 11:22.090
and that means so much to me.

11:22.090 --> 11:25.029
Alright,

11:22.090 --> 11:25.029
Im in if you guys are in.

11:25.029 --> 11:26.240
-Yes.

11:25.029 --> 11:26.240
-Were in.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.250
Alright, alright.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.240
If everything goes

11:28.250 --> 11:30.240
well with my surgery,

11:30.240 --> 11:33.259
Ill finally be able to

11:30.240 --> 11:33.259
put this nightmare behind me,

11:33.259 --> 11:37.059
and start repairing

11:33.259 --> 11:37.059
my relationship with my husband.

11:37.059 --> 11:39.120
No more lies, no more secrets,

11:39.120 --> 11:42.070
and we can all go back

11:39.120 --> 11:42.070
to the way we used to be.

11:42.070 --> 11:46.090
Im so happy.

11:46.090 --> 11:52.240
♪

11:52.240 --> 11:56.070
I dont know

11:52.240 --> 11:56.070
whats going on with that.

11:56.070 --> 11:58.049
My name is Brittnie Gardner.

11:58.049 --> 12:01.000
Im 39 years old, and after

11:58.049 --> 12:01.000
two surgeries on my nose,

12:01.000 --> 12:04.230
I feel like I got

12:01.000 --> 12:04.230
smacked in the face by a truck.

12:04.230 --> 12:08.240
My nose, its lunky

12:04.230 --> 12:08.240
and looks like a chunk of it

12:08.240 --> 12:12.049
has been taken out,

12:08.240 --> 12:12.049
and when Im talking,

12:12.049 --> 12:14.049
I dont breathe

12:12.049 --> 12:14.049
through my nose at all

12:14.049 --> 12:16.200
because I cant get enough

12:14.049 --> 12:16.200
air in to finish my sentence.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.039
[deep inhale]

12:18.039 --> 12:19.250
Here we go guys, sorry.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.110
[laughing]

12:21.110 --> 12:22.269
This is real life.

12:22.269 --> 12:24.269
This is before

12:22.269 --> 12:24.269
my first nose job.

12:24.269 --> 12:27.049
Oh my gosh, thats so weird.

12:27.049 --> 12:29.259
I come from a big Greek family

12:27.049 --> 12:29.259
where all of us have big noses,

12:29.259 --> 12:31.110
and then I was in junior high

12:31.110 --> 12:33.110
and all of a sudden

12:31.110 --> 12:33.110
I was the ugly duckling,

12:33.110 --> 12:35.070
and they would say things like--

12:35.070 --> 12:37.090
Thats when her

12:35.070 --> 12:37.090
whole personality changed.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.240
-It was in junior high.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.240
-Yeah.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.210
The hump on my nose was so large

12:41.210 --> 12:43.080
and my nose was so long.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.110
I was the ugly girl,

12:43.080 --> 12:45.110
and being the ugly girl,

12:45.110 --> 12:47.240
you learn really

12:45.110 --> 12:47.240
quick to be the funny girl,

12:47.240 --> 12:51.100
but I didnt love

12:47.240 --> 12:51.100
myself. It was hard.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.049
And you always

12:51.100 --> 12:53.049
wanted a nose job?

12:53.049 --> 12:55.100
-Mhm, from like seventh grade.

12:53.049 --> 12:55.100
-You did?

12:55.100 --> 12:58.009
Mhm. I would just

12:55.100 --> 12:58.009
tell her Accept it.

12:58.009 --> 13:00.080
-Shed be like, Tough.

12:58.009 --> 13:00.080
-Right?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.070
"I want a nose job."

13:00.080 --> 13:02.070
"Tough."

13:02.070 --> 13:05.070
I was like,

13:02.070 --> 13:05.070
pssh she dont know anything.

13:05.070 --> 13:07.279
'Til she hit 19 and then

13:05.070 --> 13:07.279
she went and had a nose job.

13:07.279 --> 13:10.090
Can you imagine,

13:07.279 --> 13:10.090
you being 19 and going

13:10.090 --> 13:12.090
and getting a nose job

13:10.090 --> 13:12.090
and not telling your mother?

13:12.090 --> 13:13.269
You didnt tell her?

13:13.269 --> 13:15.110
-Uh uh.

13:13.269 --> 13:15.110
-Why?

13:15.110 --> 13:17.100
Cause she

13:15.110 --> 13:17.100
wouldnt have liked it.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.250
I loved it. The hump was

13:17.100 --> 13:19.250
gone. It was a little shorter.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.289
It was like

13:19.250 --> 13:21.289
the best year of my life.

13:21.289 --> 13:23.259
It was like,

13:21.289 --> 13:23.259
Yes! Going into 21.

13:23.259 --> 13:26.059
I dont exactly

13:23.259 --> 13:26.059
remember when I found out.

13:26.059 --> 13:28.110
-Did you freak out?

13:26.059 --> 13:28.110
-No.

13:28.110 --> 13:30.090
I didnt freak out on her.

13:28.110 --> 13:30.090
There wasnt much

13:30.090 --> 13:32.129
-I could do about it.

13:30.090 --> 13:32.129
-Yeah, it was already done.

13:32.129 --> 13:34.070
-Right.

13:32.129 --> 13:34.070
-Whyd you get the second

13:34.070 --> 13:36.019
nose job

13:34.070 --> 13:36.019
if you already got a first one?

13:36.019 --> 13:38.029
It was right before

13:36.019 --> 13:38.029
I was about to marry your dad

13:38.029 --> 13:39.259
and I noticed that

13:38.029 --> 13:39.259
I had this weird indent.

13:39.259 --> 13:41.279
So you got a nose

13:39.259 --> 13:41.279
job for your wedding?

13:41.279 --> 13:44.029
Pretty much, that was

13:41.279 --> 13:44.029
my wedding gift to myself.

13:44.029 --> 13:47.049
So for my wedding,

13:44.029 --> 13:47.049
it was fabulous.

13:47.049 --> 13:49.120
Great pictures,

13:47.049 --> 13:49.120
I looked great, felt great.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.059
It was probably

13:49.120 --> 13:51.059
about six months after that

13:51.059 --> 13:52.259
I noticed something was wrong

13:52.259 --> 13:54.129
with the cartilage

13:52.259 --> 13:54.129
on the tip of my nose,

13:54.129 --> 13:56.019
and my nose swings this way.

13:56.019 --> 13:57.279
I think your nose is fine to me.

13:57.279 --> 13:59.289
I like it but I know you dont.

13:59.289 --> 14:03.039
I want to be able

13:59.289 --> 14:03.039
to go into my forties--

14:03.039 --> 14:04.100
Feeling good about yourself?

14:04.100 --> 14:06.000
Yeah, and not be--

14:06.000 --> 14:07.279
Insecure.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.259
Growing up,

14:07.279 --> 14:09.259
my mom and I always had

14:09.259 --> 14:11.110
a tough relationship.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.120
A lot of that

14:11.110 --> 14:13.120
probably came from that fact

14:13.120 --> 14:18.220
that I was so insecure,

14:13.120 --> 14:18.220
and my daughter is 14 years old.

14:18.220 --> 14:21.159
I really, really,

14:18.220 --> 14:21.159
really, work very hard

14:21.159 --> 14:23.139
to make her see

14:21.159 --> 14:23.139
that I love myself,

14:23.139 --> 14:25.159
so that shell love herself.

14:25.159 --> 14:28.080
It would like, crush me if she

14:25.159 --> 14:28.080
ever felt like I did as a kid.

14:28.080 --> 14:32.139
♪

14:32.139 --> 14:34.110
-Youve got to see this.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.110
-What?

14:34.110 --> 14:37.009
-Baby.

14:34.110 --> 14:37.009
-Oh no, really?

14:37.009 --> 14:38.120
Look at her cheeks.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.000
Boy, look at how

14:38.120 --> 14:41.000
intensely a baby sleeps.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.070
Like, its like painful sleep.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.070
Im so tired, Im in pain.

14:43.070 --> 14:46.149
Baby one and baby two here.

14:43.070 --> 14:46.149
Whos more high maintenance?

14:46.149 --> 14:48.110
This one in

14:46.149 --> 14:48.110
your arms or this one?

14:48.110 --> 14:51.049
Look, she

14:48.110 --> 14:51.049
doesnt want to answer.

14:51.049 --> 14:52.269
I know, its this one.

14:52.269 --> 14:56.279
Waaah. Waaah. My facelift

14:52.269 --> 14:56.279
is starting to loosen.

14:56.279 --> 15:01.029
I need more botox,

14:56.279 --> 15:01.029
Brittnie. Bring me the hair dye.

15:01.029 --> 15:03.019
I want you to

15:01.029 --> 15:03.019
look at this patient.

15:03.019 --> 15:05.090
What celebrity do you

15:03.019 --> 15:05.090
think her nose looks like?

15:05.090 --> 15:07.149
This guy was in

15:05.090 --> 15:07.149
with Ben Stiller.

15:07.149 --> 15:09.039
Yes, thats Owen Wilson.

15:09.039 --> 15:11.000
Owen Wilson, yeah.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.169
Yes, they did all the movies.

15:12.169 --> 15:14.250
By the way, how did this happen?

15:14.250 --> 15:17.120
All I know is that her last

15:14.250 --> 15:17.120
surgery was a long time ago.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.100
So lets meet her

15:17.120 --> 15:19.100
and lets hear her story.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.240
Can you please send in Brittnie?

15:20.240 --> 15:22.080
-Brittnie.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.080
-Hello.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.029
-Nice to meet you.

15:24.029 --> 15:25.159
Im happy to meet you.

15:25.159 --> 15:27.070
Hi, Brittnie. Terry Dubrow,

15:25.159 --> 15:27.070
pleasure.

15:27.070 --> 15:28.289
Please have a seat.

15:28.289 --> 15:31.009
Dr. Dubrow and I were

15:28.289 --> 15:31.009
looking at your photos,

15:31.009 --> 15:33.090
and you know, thought it looked

15:31.009 --> 15:33.090
a little bit like Owen Wilson.

15:33.090 --> 15:35.149
Yes, thank you. My friends

15:33.090 --> 15:35.149
tell me that all the time.

15:35.149 --> 15:37.080
Oh, how nice!

15:37.080 --> 15:39.080
When I was younger

15:37.080 --> 15:39.080
it was Michael Bolton.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.059
Because of my bad perm,

15:39.080 --> 15:41.059
and now its Owen Wilson.

15:41.059 --> 15:43.070
So what happened?

15:43.070 --> 15:45.059
I always hated

15:43.070 --> 15:45.059
my nose and at 19 I decided,

15:45.059 --> 15:46.279
Im going to get a nose job,"

15:46.279 --> 15:48.179
and then about

15:46.279 --> 15:48.179
a year later I noticed

15:48.179 --> 15:52.059
that on the left side

15:48.179 --> 15:52.059
I started to get this indent.

15:52.059 --> 15:54.039
So, I went in for the revision,

15:54.039 --> 15:56.289
and then about six months later,

15:54.039 --> 15:56.289
it just got gradually worse.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.019
Your nose has gotten

15:56.289 --> 15:59.019
increasingly more crooked.

15:59.019 --> 16:00.289
The whole thing

15:59.019 --> 16:00.289
is getting worse.

16:00.289 --> 16:03.000
-What about your breathing?

16:00.289 --> 16:03.000
-Oh, my breathing is awful.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.149
Growing up,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.149
she would come home crying

16:04.149 --> 16:06.070
all of the time but I told her,

16:06.070 --> 16:08.039
Eventually,

16:06.070 --> 16:08.039
you will just grow into it

16:08.039 --> 16:09.200
as you get older

16:08.039 --> 16:09.200
and get used to it.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.120
I feel awful about

16:09.200 --> 16:13.120
how bad it did bother her

16:13.120 --> 16:16.029
and me maybe not being

16:13.120 --> 16:16.029
as supportive as I could have.

16:16.029 --> 16:20.149
Im just hoping Dr. Nassif

16:16.029 --> 16:20.149
and Dr. Dubrow can help her

16:20.149 --> 16:22.279
and we can get through

16:20.149 --> 16:22.279
it and come out stronger

16:22.279 --> 16:24.080
on the other side.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.269
Tell us what your goals are.

16:25.269 --> 16:27.159
Getting a little

16:25.269 --> 16:27.159
bit more breathing,

16:27.159 --> 16:29.129
some air through

16:27.159 --> 16:29.129
there would be great,

16:29.129 --> 16:31.110
and the lumpy nose thing

16:29.129 --> 16:31.110
doesnt really work for me.

16:31.110 --> 16:33.259
I would just like it

16:31.110 --> 16:33.259
to be smooth, straighter.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.059
So, what happens is

16:33.259 --> 16:36.059
the skin shrink wraps

16:36.059 --> 16:39.080
around the cartilage

16:36.059 --> 16:39.080
and makes it look like this,

16:39.080 --> 16:42.210
and if you have thin skin,

16:39.080 --> 16:42.210
you can see more

16:42.210 --> 16:46.000
of what we call bossa

16:42.210 --> 16:46.000
which is the sharp points

16:46.000 --> 16:49.090
of cartilage. So you got

16:46.000 --> 16:49.090
two extremely difficult things,

16:49.090 --> 16:53.039
crooked is one.

16:49.090 --> 16:53.039
Two, cartilage warping,

16:53.039 --> 16:56.149
and to try to fix it,

16:53.039 --> 16:56.149
is really hard to do.

16:58.029 --> 17:00.059
If I had my own anime,

17:00.059 --> 17:03.059
I think it would be

17:00.059 --> 17:03.059
this big-boobed, super thick,

17:03.059 --> 17:06.059
sexy female warrior.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.000
Oh my God, look at

17:06.059 --> 17:09.000
that. Theres a sciatic nerve.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.180
Holy sh--!

17:16.170 --> 17:19.019
I want

17:19.019 --> 17:21.289
Youre really caved in

17:19.019 --> 17:21.289
on the right-middle wall.

17:21.289 --> 17:25.130
No support at all

17:21.289 --> 17:25.130
around the tip cartilage,

17:25.130 --> 17:27.130
but the bones

17:25.130 --> 17:27.130
are pretty straight.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.140
This cartilage here is

17:27.130 --> 17:30.140
over-receptive on the right

17:30.140 --> 17:33.079
and thats where

17:30.140 --> 17:33.079
everything is falling off to.

17:33.079 --> 17:35.289
Nice, complex way to fix this.

17:35.289 --> 17:38.009
Youre welcome.

17:38.009 --> 17:40.170
Its not easy. Oh boy,

17:38.009 --> 17:40.170
whats puzzling and complex

17:40.170 --> 17:42.220
about Brittnies nose

17:40.170 --> 17:42.220
is the bones are straight.

17:42.220 --> 17:45.230
If the bones were crooked,

17:42.220 --> 17:45.230
it makes it so much easier

17:45.230 --> 17:47.190
to fix the nose

17:45.230 --> 17:47.190
because I can break the bones,

17:47.190 --> 17:50.089
and the whole nose

17:47.190 --> 17:50.089
usually will just straighten.

17:50.089 --> 17:52.109
In Brittnies situation,

17:50.089 --> 17:52.109
theyre straight

17:52.109 --> 17:54.150
but all

17:52.109 --> 17:54.150
the cartilage has deviated

17:54.150 --> 17:57.039
and the shrink-wrappage

17:54.150 --> 17:57.039
of the skin makes the surgery

17:57.039 --> 18:00.009
a lot more

17:57.039 --> 18:00.009
complicated and risky.

18:00.009 --> 18:04.099
How do you fix this?

18:00.009 --> 18:04.099
You have weak cartilage

18:04.099 --> 18:07.210
thats fallen in,

18:04.099 --> 18:07.210
fallen over, collapsed.

18:07.210 --> 18:10.099
We need to either

18:07.210 --> 18:10.099
replace some of it,

18:10.099 --> 18:12.099
or add strength to it,

18:10.099 --> 18:12.099
make sense?

18:12.099 --> 18:14.220
Especially, we need

18:12.099 --> 18:14.220
some cartilage thats firm

18:14.220 --> 18:17.119
and strong enough to

18:14.220 --> 18:17.119
help fight some of those forces

18:17.119 --> 18:19.150
and push it the other way.

18:19.150 --> 18:22.000
So, were going to have to

18:19.150 --> 18:22.000
use a piece of ripped cartilage

18:22.000 --> 18:25.109
to reconstruct every

18:22.000 --> 18:25.109
different section of your nose.

18:25.109 --> 18:27.140
I dont know if I can

18:25.109 --> 18:27.140
get it straight completely.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.200
The answer is probably no,

18:29.200 --> 18:32.109
but if I get a 40% improvement,

18:32.109 --> 18:35.049
are you going to be happy?

18:35.049 --> 18:37.200
Oh yeah, any improvement

18:35.049 --> 18:37.200
is going to be great.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.250
At this point I would take

18:37.200 --> 18:40.250
like a 10%. Id take like a 17%.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.089
-17%?

18:40.250 --> 18:43.089
-Yeah.

18:43.089 --> 18:46.210
I cant go into

18:43.089 --> 18:46.210
the second half of my life

18:46.210 --> 18:48.170
as an un-functioning person.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.119
I am confident that

18:48.170 --> 18:50.119
Dr. Nassif will be able

18:50.119 --> 18:53.009
to help me though. I truly

18:50.119 --> 18:53.009
believe he is a nose god.

18:54.049 --> 18:59.079
♪

18:59.079 --> 19:02.109
-Hi.

18:59.079 --> 19:02.109
- Hey guys, welcome back.

19:02.109 --> 19:06.019
So, Im so excited for

19:02.109 --> 19:06.019
Hestia. Weve got mostly done.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.230
Theres some final

19:06.019 --> 19:07.230
touches and I want to make sure

19:07.230 --> 19:09.220
that all the fit is good on you.

19:09.220 --> 19:13.019
Hestia is from Is It

19:09.220 --> 19:13.019
Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls

19:13.019 --> 19:15.180
In A Dungeon? Its one

19:13.019 --> 19:15.180
of my favourite anime characters

19:15.180 --> 19:21.180
and she's this, like, cute,

19:15.180 --> 19:21.180
short, big-boobed goddess.

19:21.180 --> 19:24.009
-Wow.

19:21.180 --> 19:24.009
-I know I love it.

19:24.009 --> 19:27.059
Look how tiny your

19:24.009 --> 19:27.059
waist looks. Thats amazing.

19:27.059 --> 19:29.160
-Its super sexy.

19:27.059 --> 19:29.160
-You look beautiful.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.269
Oh my God, I feel like Hestia.

19:31.269 --> 19:34.069
I feel great.

19:31.269 --> 19:34.069
I feel really sexy,

19:34.069 --> 19:36.059
like Im ready to jump into TV.

19:36.059 --> 19:40.079
If I had my own anime

19:36.059 --> 19:40.079
I think it would be like,

19:40.079 --> 19:45.240
going from this really skinny,

19:40.079 --> 19:45.240
bashful nerd student

19:45.240 --> 19:48.210
in high school

19:45.240 --> 19:48.210
and at night she fights crime

19:48.210 --> 19:52.079
and she becomes,

19:48.210 --> 19:52.079
this like, big-boobed like,

19:52.079 --> 19:56.089
super thick,

19:52.079 --> 19:56.089
sexy female warrior.

19:56.089 --> 20:00.250
Shes really addicted to

19:56.089 --> 20:00.250
see these Japanese cartoons.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.259
Shell be like,

20:00.250 --> 20:02.259
Change the channel.

20:02.259 --> 20:04.269
"Im tired of you watching

20:02.259 --> 20:04.269
"these stupid Japanese cartoons.

20:04.269 --> 20:07.049
"I want to watch my novela.

20:07.049 --> 20:10.069
Well, I think it looks amazing.

20:07.049 --> 20:10.069
Weve got some minor adjustments

20:10.069 --> 20:12.180
and I know Im going to

20:10.069 --> 20:12.180
take it in on the sides here

20:12.180 --> 20:14.250
for you. Just so its

20:12.180 --> 20:14.250
a little more open in the bust.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.180
Just remember when youre like,

20:16.180 --> 20:18.099
fixing it that this

20:16.180 --> 20:18.099
boob is a bit smaller.

20:18.099 --> 20:21.109
This one is 1600cc

20:18.099 --> 20:21.109
and this one is 1300cc

20:21.109 --> 20:24.109
but Im going to see

20:21.109 --> 20:24.109
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow.

20:24.109 --> 20:28.200
Hopefully, they can operate

20:24.109 --> 20:28.200
on me and make it bigger.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.259
Carla, she wants to

20:28.200 --> 20:32.259
be an anime character

20:32.259 --> 20:37.250
and I worry about this situation

20:32.259 --> 20:37.250
because its out of control.

20:37.250 --> 20:41.279
This is so big. Its huge.

20:37.250 --> 20:41.279
You already promised to me

20:41.279 --> 20:44.259
and I am not agreeing with this.

20:44.259 --> 20:48.069
Yeah, I mean Ill go smaller.

20:48.069 --> 20:50.099
Im really trying to

20:48.069 --> 20:50.099
keep the peace with my mom

20:50.099 --> 20:53.190
but I need to go bigger,

20:50.099 --> 20:53.190
and Im going to go as far

20:53.190 --> 20:55.200
as I have to in

20:53.190 --> 20:55.200
order to get the vision

20:55.200 --> 20:56.240
that I have in my mind.

once I take these out,

21:07.140 --> 21:09.089
will she have something in here?

21:09.089 --> 21:12.220
If I can take a piece

21:09.089 --> 21:12.220
of fat and rotate it down,

21:12.220 --> 21:14.200
I might be able to

21:12.220 --> 21:14.200
give you some projection,

21:14.200 --> 21:16.150
and then lift

21:14.200 --> 21:16.150
you buttock over that.

Thats kind

21:16.150 --> 21:18.119

♪

21:23.180 --> 21:26.079
Today for Yulianas surgery,

21:23.180 --> 21:26.079
I will start by making

21:26.079 --> 21:28.190
an incision through her

21:26.079 --> 21:28.190
previous buttocks surgery scar

21:28.190 --> 21:30.240
and remove the implants. Then,

21:28.190 --> 21:30.240
I will inspect

21:30.240 --> 21:33.140
the pockets and remove

21:30.240 --> 21:33.140
any leftover silicone.

21:33.140 --> 21:36.109
Next, I will try to find

21:33.140 --> 21:36.109
fatty tissue to rotate down

21:36.109 --> 21:38.279
into the buttock pocket

21:36.109 --> 21:38.279
to give her some projection,

21:38.279 --> 21:41.130
and then lift her

21:38.279 --> 21:41.130
buttock over it to give her

21:41.130 --> 21:43.099
a better overall shape.

21:43.099 --> 21:46.130
Okay, so the first thing

21:43.099 --> 21:46.130
to do is to explore the pocket

21:46.130 --> 21:49.099
and determine

21:46.130 --> 21:49.099
exactly where the implant is.

21:49.099 --> 21:52.130
Oh boy, look at that silicone.

21:52.130 --> 21:53.240
[bleep]

21:53.240 --> 21:55.259
Okay, already bad news.

21:55.259 --> 21:57.160
We havent even

21:55.259 --> 21:57.160
opened the pocket yet

21:57.160 --> 21:59.130
and weve run

21:57.160 --> 21:59.130
into silicone already.

21:59.130 --> 22:02.200
Okay great, so theres like,

21:59.130 --> 22:02.200
a significant amount

22:02.200 --> 22:07.079
of residual silicone left.

22:02.200 --> 22:07.079
Thats a potential problem

22:07.079 --> 22:10.150
because the more silicone,

22:07.079 --> 22:10.150
the more inflammation,

22:10.150 --> 22:14.119
the less blood supply,

22:10.150 --> 22:14.119
and less potential for healing.

22:14.119 --> 22:22.119
No, this is all icky,

22:14.119 --> 22:22.119
gooey silicone.

22:22.119 --> 22:25.009
Oh, theres tons of this crap.

22:25.009 --> 22:28.240
Aye, the more I take out,

22:28.240 --> 22:31.180
the harder this

22:28.240 --> 22:31.180
reconstruction is going to be.

22:31.180 --> 22:34.130
Okay, so heres

22:31.180 --> 22:34.130
the implant pocket.

22:34.130 --> 22:39.210
Alright so, look at this.

22:34.130 --> 22:39.210
This is the implant.

22:39.210 --> 22:43.160
So, its a 555cc implant.

22:39.210 --> 22:43.160
Which is a very big implant.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.220
They put it--

22:43.160 --> 22:46.220
Oh my God, look at that.

22:46.220 --> 22:50.210
Theres the sciatic nerve.

22:46.220 --> 22:50.210
Holy sh--.

22:50.210 --> 22:52.140
Youre not supposed to lift up

22:52.140 --> 22:55.230
the entire gluteus

22:52.140 --> 22:55.230
maximus muscle. Do you see this?

22:55.230 --> 22:58.089
This is f---ing crazy.

22:58.089 --> 23:01.029
I got 800cc.

23:01.029 --> 23:02.210
Without my permission.

23:02.210 --> 23:04.109
She basically

23:02.210 --> 23:04.109
had secret surgery.

23:04.109 --> 23:05.279
She told me Im going hiking.

23:05.279 --> 23:10.099
Theres no anterior nasal spine.

23:10.099 --> 23:12.240
No matter what I do

23:10.099 --> 23:12.240
to reconstruct a nose,

23:12.240 --> 23:14.220
I cant guarantee

23:12.240 --> 23:14.220
its going to be strong

23:14.220 --> 23:16.089
or remain straight.

23:16.089 --> 23:17.220
That sucks.

23:25.170 --> 23:32.019
The main nerve to the leg is the

23:25.170 --> 23:32.019
sciatic nerve, there it is. Wow.

23:32.019 --> 23:35.029
The sciatic

23:32.019 --> 23:35.029
nerve is a giant nerve

23:35.029 --> 23:38.099
that controls

23:35.029 --> 23:38.099
motor and sensory function

23:38.099 --> 23:40.180
to your lower extremities.

23:40.180 --> 23:43.000
Okay well,

23:40.180 --> 23:43.000
were closing up that pocket.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Bye bye, sciatic nerve.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.109
Were going to give you

23:45.000 --> 23:47.109
a big nice cushion over that.

23:47.109 --> 23:50.190
Bizarre,

23:47.109 --> 23:50.190
look how high it goes up here.

23:50.190 --> 23:54.220
It goes way up

23:50.190 --> 23:54.220
the back. The hell, he got lost.

23:54.220 --> 23:59.029
You never ever

23:54.220 --> 23:59.029
place buttock implants

23:59.029 --> 24:01.000
completely underneath the muscle

24:01.000 --> 24:03.109
'cause if you

24:01.000 --> 24:03.109
elevate up the muscle,

24:03.109 --> 24:05.200
youre elevating

24:03.109 --> 24:05.200
up the detachments

24:05.200 --> 24:07.130
that define

24:05.200 --> 24:07.130
the borders of the muscle.

24:07.130 --> 24:10.109
So, if you put it

24:07.130 --> 24:10.109
under it and detach it.

24:10.109 --> 24:13.150
Whats preventing it

24:10.109 --> 24:13.150
from slipping all the way up

24:13.150 --> 24:18.029
to the back? That surgeon is,

24:13.150 --> 24:18.029
for lack of a better term,

24:18.029 --> 24:20.119
a complete moron.

24:20.119 --> 24:22.279
The question is,

24:20.119 --> 24:22.279
do we have anything now

24:22.279 --> 24:26.130
to rotate down to give

24:22.279 --> 24:26.130
her some kind of projection?

24:26.130 --> 24:29.240
This is what I was

24:26.130 --> 24:29.240
feeling before, this.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.269
That is something. Well,

24:29.240 --> 24:33.269
here it is, pathetic

24:33.269 --> 24:36.170
but I mean its

24:33.269 --> 24:36.170
alive. It is alive,

24:36.170 --> 24:38.019
you can see the edges bleed.

24:38.019 --> 24:41.000
Fortunately,

24:38.019 --> 24:41.000
this fat flap does seem

24:41.000 --> 24:45.180
to have its own independent,

24:41.000 --> 24:45.180
intact blood supply,

24:45.180 --> 24:48.250
and Im hoping itll do

24:45.180 --> 24:48.250
something,

24:48.250 --> 24:50.059
at least a little bit,

24:50.059 --> 24:52.289
to restore

24:50.059 --> 24:52.289
normal buttock contour.

24:52.289 --> 24:55.029

24:55.029 --> 24:57.130

25:05.220 --> 25:09.049
This case is extraordinarily

25:05.220 --> 25:09.049
labour intensive.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.269
I mean its,

25:09.049 --> 25:11.269
you know, got more projection

25:11.269 --> 25:13.150
than my butt.

25:13.150 --> 25:15.240
So, lets go on the other side.

Look at this. She

25:15.240 --> 25:18.170
still has a lot of silicone.

a lot of the silicone

before I can

25:21.009 --> 25:22.289

in order to

25:22.289 --> 25:25.190

26:49.200 --> 26:51.230
It was 470cc and then--

26:51.230 --> 26:52.289
Is that silicone or saline?

26:52.289 --> 26:54.049
-Silicone.

26:52.289 --> 26:54.049
-Alright.

26:54.049 --> 26:56.019
But then, when I woke up I said,

26:56.019 --> 26:58.000
Oh my God,

26:56.019 --> 26:58.000
no theyre still too small.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.160
-Right away?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.160
-Yeah.

26:59.160 --> 27:02.220
Seven months later, I got 800cc.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.220
-So you doubled?

-Yes.

Your boobs look so big,

27:12.230 --> 27:15.000
and she said,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.230
No mom, its the dress.

27:16.230 --> 27:19.259
But 800 is a lot

27:16.230 --> 27:19.259
smaller than this, right?

27:19.259 --> 27:21.170
-Yeah.

27:21.170 --> 27:23.069

No, that was under

She told me, Im going hiking."

27:37.170 --> 27:42.029
So, did you come back

27:37.170 --> 27:42.029
home with the gigantic breasts?

27:42.029 --> 27:44.230
Yes, but I was

27:42.029 --> 27:44.230
wearing a big sweater.

27:44.230 --> 27:47.069
Alright, so you went

27:44.230 --> 27:47.069
in to have the silicone 800s

27:47.069 --> 27:49.230
exchanged for 1600 saline.

27:49.230 --> 27:51.089
-Wow.

27:51.089 --> 27:53.230
One week later,

27:51.089 --> 27:53.230
I started to have fevers.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.200
Just the fever, no breast pain?

27:55.200 --> 27:58.059
No, so then I go to

27:55.200 --> 27:58.059
the ER. They ran some tests

27:58.059 --> 28:00.180
and they told me

27:58.059 --> 28:00.180
that it was my right breast

28:00.180 --> 28:02.059
that was causing the problem

28:02.059 --> 28:04.069
and that it was

28:02.059 --> 28:04.069
a staph infection.

28:04.069 --> 28:06.289
The plastic

28:04.069 --> 28:06.289
surgeon came and he said,

28:06.289 --> 28:09.009
Were going to

28:06.289 --> 28:09.009
give you antibiotics

28:09.009 --> 28:10.289
and perform an emergency surgery

28:10.289 --> 28:12.279
to remove the implant.

28:12.279 --> 28:15.220
And I said, Are you

28:12.279 --> 28:15.220
going to put something in?"

28:15.220 --> 28:18.259
And he said, Yes,

28:15.220 --> 28:18.259
Ill try to put an implant in

28:18.259 --> 28:20.190
-"but it has to be smaller."

28:18.259 --> 28:20.190
-What?

28:20.190 --> 28:22.119
Its been like, about two months

28:22.119 --> 28:24.200
since Ive been out of

28:22.119 --> 28:24.200
the hospital, and I feel fine.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.069
How long were you

28:24.200 --> 28:26.069
on antibiotics for?

28:26.069 --> 28:28.039
Im still on them currently.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.079
You got very lucky.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.079
Very, very lucky.

28:30.079 --> 28:33.059
When you keep an

28:30.079 --> 28:33.059
implant in a patient

28:33.059 --> 28:35.250
who has an active

28:33.059 --> 28:35.250
breast implant infection.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.230
Even when you wash it out,

28:37.230 --> 28:40.190
youre subjecting that patient

28:37.230 --> 28:40.190
to a recurrent infection,

28:40.190 --> 28:43.190
a systemic infection

28:40.190 --> 28:43.190
that can be life threatening,

28:43.190 --> 28:46.230
a capsular contracture,

28:43.190 --> 28:46.230
exposure.

28:46.230 --> 28:48.230
Thats not

28:46.230 --> 28:48.230
something I would ever do.

28:48.230 --> 28:50.130
What other

28:48.230 --> 28:50.130
plastic surgery procedures

28:50.130 --> 28:52.099
are you planning as

28:50.130 --> 28:52.099
part of this process?

28:52.099 --> 28:53.289
Now, be honest.

28:52.099 --> 28:53.289
I know Moms here.

28:53.289 --> 28:55.130
I want to get my nose done.

28:55.130 --> 28:57.230
I want the bridge more curved

28:57.230 --> 28:59.089
and more refined from the tip.

28:59.089 --> 29:01.079
-Like anime?

28:59.089 --> 29:01.079
-Yeah.

29:01.079 --> 29:03.140
-Well, thats crazy.

29:01.079 --> 29:03.140
-What else?

29:03.140 --> 29:07.029
I want to make this breast 1600

29:07.029 --> 29:09.259
and also in the near future,

29:09.259 --> 29:12.089
I want to go up to

29:09.259 --> 29:12.089
2000cc cause thats my goal.

29:12.089 --> 29:14.049
You told me you

29:12.089 --> 29:14.049
want to take the big one

29:14.049 --> 29:17.069
and leave the small one,

29:14.049 --> 29:17.069
and you want to change

29:17.069 --> 29:18.259
the big one for the small one.

29:18.259 --> 29:20.069
-See?

29:18.259 --> 29:20.069
-Mom, youre believing her?

29:20.069 --> 29:22.039
You promised to me.

29:22.039 --> 29:23.289
So, youre not going

29:22.039 --> 29:23.289
to listen to your mom?

29:23.289 --> 29:25.220
Its my passion.

29:23.289 --> 29:25.220
It makes me happy

29:25.220 --> 29:27.079
and gives me a reason to live.

29:27.079 --> 29:29.230
What if it kills you?

29:31.269 --> 29:34.000
So, why dont

29:31.269 --> 29:34.000
we go in the exam room

29:34.000 --> 29:36.009
and maybe we can give

29:34.000 --> 29:36.009
you some really good advice

29:36.009 --> 29:38.000
-and help you, huh?

29:36.009 --> 29:38.000
-Youre gonna hear some advice,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.009
but youre not going to

29:38.000 --> 29:40.009
like it. Just telling you now.

29:40.009 --> 29:41.099
-You might like my advice.

29:40.009 --> 29:41.099
-Okay.

29:41.099 --> 29:42.220
Youre not going to like mine.

29:45.089 --> 29:47.099
If you continue down this path,

29:47.099 --> 29:49.029
youre going to ruin yourself.

29:50.069 --> 29:54.019
Im really hoping that

29:50.069 --> 29:54.019
the incision remains intact

29:54.019 --> 29:59.250
and that theres some

29:54.019 --> 29:59.250
projection. Fingers crossed.

30:05.019 --> 30:07.059
.

30:07.059 --> 30:11.000
So, this one is

30:07.059 --> 30:11.000
your non-involved one.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.240
So, 1600cc,

30:11.000 --> 30:15.240
its not encapsulated,

30:15.240 --> 30:19.000
but its very tight

30:15.240 --> 30:19.000
because its just very big.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.059
Now this one,

30:19.000 --> 30:22.059
you just had a recent infection.

30:22.059 --> 30:26.099
Im amazed that your

30:22.059 --> 30:26.099
doctor took a breast implant

30:26.099 --> 30:30.250
that was infected, took it out,

30:26.099 --> 30:30.250
put a smaller one in,

30:30.250 --> 30:34.000
closed it up. And first of all,

30:30.250 --> 30:34.000
amazed that it worked

30:34.000 --> 30:35.099
because it

30:34.000 --> 30:35.099
shouldnt have worked.

30:35.099 --> 30:37.049
It should have pussed out

30:37.049 --> 30:39.069
because the foreign

30:37.049 --> 30:39.069
bodys still there.

30:39.069 --> 30:41.089
You know, its not

30:39.069 --> 30:41.089
like you got rid of the thing

30:41.089 --> 30:43.000
that the bacteria

30:41.089 --> 30:43.000
is attaching to.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.089
Be that as it may,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.089
its not over.

30:45.089 --> 30:47.089
Youre on

30:45.089 --> 30:47.089
antibiotics so you dont know

30:47.089 --> 30:49.259
whether its been

30:47.089 --> 30:49.259
completely treated or not.

30:49.259 --> 30:52.069
There is no doubt

30:49.259 --> 30:52.069
that you cannot have surgery

30:52.069 --> 30:54.009
right now because

30:52.069 --> 30:54.009
you have to figure out

30:54.009 --> 30:56.109
whether the bacteria

30:54.009 --> 30:56.109
that were in there

30:56.109 --> 30:58.109
are just lying dormant

30:56.109 --> 30:58.109
or just being suppressed

30:58.109 --> 31:00.259
by the current

30:58.109 --> 31:00.259
whirl of antibiotics

31:00.259 --> 31:03.099
that youre taking

31:00.259 --> 31:03.099
or whether theyre gone.

31:03.099 --> 31:06.089
I mean it sucks

31:03.099 --> 31:06.089
because this was my dream.

31:06.089 --> 31:09.220
This is serious Karla.

31:06.089 --> 31:09.220
We really talk about this.

31:09.220 --> 31:13.240
-I really want 1600cc.

31:09.220 --> 31:13.240
-No.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.150
Let me just tell you my opinion.

31:15.150 --> 31:17.269
When I hear something like that,

31:15.150 --> 31:17.269
it upsets me.

31:17.269 --> 31:19.119
I have a brand new baby girl.

31:19.119 --> 31:21.099
If you were

31:19.119 --> 31:21.099
my daughter sitting here

31:21.099 --> 31:23.079
and were kind

31:21.099 --> 31:23.079
of acting like that right now,

31:23.079 --> 31:25.059
because I imagine my little

31:23.079 --> 31:25.059
girl sitting here right now,

31:25.059 --> 31:27.069
I would be going crazy.

31:27.069 --> 31:30.099
Youre trying to look like

31:27.069 --> 31:30.099
frickin' cartoon characters.

31:30.099 --> 31:32.259
Its not real, okay?

31:32.259 --> 31:34.259
If you continue down this path,

31:34.259 --> 31:37.259
youre going to ruin yourself.

31:34.259 --> 31:37.259
It can affect your health.

31:37.259 --> 31:40.089
Thats the most important

31:37.259 --> 31:40.089
thing. You can die from it.

31:40.089 --> 31:42.089
Youre not touching your nose.

31:42.089 --> 31:44.099
Im not even going

31:42.089 --> 31:44.099
to examine your nose.

31:44.099 --> 31:46.089
If you touch your nose right now

31:46.089 --> 31:49.000
and make a slope

31:46.089 --> 31:49.000
and make it like this character,

31:49.000 --> 31:50.259
youll ruin your face.

31:50.259 --> 31:52.119
Youre too young

31:50.259 --> 31:52.119
and beautiful to do that.

31:52.119 --> 31:55.000
Im talking

31:52.119 --> 31:55.000
emotionally from my heart.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.109
When I first had

31:55.000 --> 31:57.109
my first procedure I thought,

31:57.109 --> 31:59.079
Okay, thats it," you know?

31:59.079 --> 32:01.059
But then,

31:59.079 --> 32:01.059
I wake up and I realize,

32:01.059 --> 32:03.059
You know,

32:01.059 --> 32:03.059
I think I need a bit more,"

32:03.059 --> 32:04.170
and then I think in my head

32:04.170 --> 32:06.099
that Im going to be so happy

32:06.099 --> 32:08.269
and then feel 100 times better,

32:06.099 --> 32:08.269
and then I do,

32:08.269 --> 32:10.279
and then that kind

32:08.269 --> 32:10.279
of feeling goes away,

32:10.279 --> 32:12.089
and then I feel ugly again.

32:12.089 --> 32:14.079
Thats called addiction.

32:14.079 --> 32:16.039
So, I think

32:14.079 --> 32:16.039
the smartest thing for you to do

32:16.039 --> 32:19.150
is for you guys as a family,

32:16.039 --> 32:19.150
work with a therapist

32:19.150 --> 32:21.119
and really try

32:19.150 --> 32:21.119
to work through this

32:21.119 --> 32:23.180
to see if you could

32:21.119 --> 32:23.180
kind of help yourself.

32:23.180 --> 32:25.160
All of a sudden,

32:23.180 --> 32:25.160
because you think its going

32:25.160 --> 32:27.059
to make you happy

32:25.160 --> 32:27.059
then you already know

32:27.059 --> 32:28.289
that theres

32:27.059 --> 32:28.289
a high and then a low.

32:28.289 --> 32:30.089
And that can lead to depression.

32:30.089 --> 32:31.289
That can lead to

32:30.089 --> 32:31.289
all kinds of things.

32:31.289 --> 32:34.039
So, youve got to get some help.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.279
Promise me that

32:34.039 --> 32:35.279
you wont do anything

32:35.279 --> 32:37.150
at least

32:35.279 --> 32:37.150
without telling your mom.

32:37.150 --> 32:40.009
-Yes, I promise.

32:37.150 --> 32:40.009
-I think thats fair.

32:40.009 --> 32:42.079
I think

32:40.009 --> 32:42.079
the advice that Dr. Nassif

32:42.079 --> 32:43.180
and Dr. Dubrow gave me,

32:43.180 --> 32:45.089
they made a lot of good points

32:45.089 --> 32:48.140
and Im really

32:45.089 --> 32:48.140
hoping that if I continue

32:48.140 --> 32:50.119
to have surgery,

32:48.140 --> 32:50.119
that it really doesnt ruin

32:50.119 --> 32:52.059
my relationship with my mom,

32:52.059 --> 32:54.119
but I have a lot to work on.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
♪

33:03.000 --> 33:05.059
Well, this is it.

33:05.059 --> 33:07.150
It is, Im really nervous.

33:07.150 --> 33:10.099
I know you are

33:07.150 --> 33:10.099
honey. Its going to be good.

33:10.099 --> 33:13.170
Waited a long time but

33:10.099 --> 33:13.170
its going to be all good.

33:13.170 --> 33:15.119
Todays the day

33:13.170 --> 33:15.119
the new chapter begins

33:15.119 --> 33:19.170
and Im hoping after

33:15.119 --> 33:19.170
the surgery that self-love

33:19.170 --> 33:21.150
and self-acceptance

33:19.170 --> 33:21.150
will come a lot easier

33:21.150 --> 33:23.009
than it has in the past.

33:23.009 --> 33:25.049
Brittnie?

33:23.009 --> 33:25.049
We are ready for you.

33:25.049 --> 33:27.140
-Great.

33:25.049 --> 33:27.140
-Love you.

33:27.140 --> 33:31.079
Youre going to do great.

33:31.079 --> 33:33.079
Just me and my new

33:31.079 --> 33:33.079
nose are going to be pals.

33:33.079 --> 33:36.009
-Well take good care of her.

33:33.079 --> 33:36.009
-Thank you.

33:36.009 --> 33:41.119
♪

33:41.119 --> 33:44.059
For Brittnies surgery,

33:41.119 --> 33:44.059
Ill start by opening the nose

33:44.059 --> 33:46.009
while Dr. Peng harvests rib.

33:46.009 --> 33:48.130
Next, Ill perform

33:46.009 --> 33:48.130
a Revision Septoplasty

33:48.130 --> 33:50.150
and a Turbinate Outfracture.

33:50.150 --> 33:53.029
Then, Ill perform

33:50.150 --> 33:53.029
Osteotomies to straighten

33:53.029 --> 33:55.160
the nasal bones and add

33:53.029 --> 33:55.160
in Septal Support Grafts,

33:55.160 --> 33:59.059
Bilateral Rim Grafts,

33:55.160 --> 33:59.059
and a Septal Extension Graft

33:59.059 --> 34:01.150
to give her more

33:59.059 --> 34:01.150
support and counter effect

34:01.150 --> 34:04.099
the crooked cartilage. Finally,

34:01.150 --> 34:04.099
Ill add a Batten Graft

34:04.099 --> 34:06.069
along the septum to finish.

34:06.069 --> 34:09.050
Hopefully, leaving Brittnie

34:06.069 --> 34:09.050
with a much straighter nose.

34:09.050 --> 34:11.010
Okay, were

34:09.050 --> 34:11.010
starting the incision.

34:11.010 --> 34:13.170
Lets see what fun

34:11.010 --> 34:13.170
were going to run into.

34:13.170 --> 34:17.019
Lets just look at

34:13.170 --> 34:17.019
the cartilage for a minute.

34:17.019 --> 34:20.010
The dome on the left is higher.

34:20.010 --> 34:22.170
Theres no anterior nasal spine,

34:20.010 --> 34:22.170
that sucks.

34:22.170 --> 34:24.070
That sucks.

34:24.070 --> 34:26.110
This case is

34:24.070 --> 34:26.110
getting more difficult.

34:26.110 --> 34:29.280
Brittnie does not

34:26.110 --> 34:29.280
have an anterior nasal spine

34:29.280 --> 34:31.199
and thats where

34:29.280 --> 34:31.199
the septum rests on

34:31.199 --> 34:34.219
to center the entire

34:31.199 --> 34:34.219
nose. Its right here.

34:34.219 --> 34:36.179
Now, without an

34:34.219 --> 34:36.179
anterior nasal spine,

34:36.179 --> 34:38.219
no matter what you

34:36.179 --> 34:38.219
do to reconstruct a nose,

34:38.219 --> 34:40.219
I cant guarantee

34:38.219 --> 34:40.219
that its going to be strong

34:40.219 --> 34:42.179
or remain straight.

34:42.179 --> 34:45.179
It looks like were

34:42.179 --> 34:45.179
finding almost everything

34:45.179 --> 34:47.210
thats causing

34:45.179 --> 34:47.210
this nose to deviate.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.039
This is frustrating

34:47.210 --> 34:50.039
to say the least.

34:50.039 --> 34:53.219
Im cutting off

34:50.039 --> 34:53.219
the whole frickin' dome.

34:53.219 --> 34:55.289
Starting fresh

34:53.219 --> 34:55.289
with the tip of the nose.

34:55.289 --> 34:57.170
Is this very aggressive?

34:57.170 --> 34:59.190
Yes, but Im

34:57.170 --> 34:59.190
hoping that clearing it out

34:59.190 --> 35:02.150
and rebuilding it from scratch,

34:59.190 --> 35:02.150
from her own rib,

35:02.150 --> 35:05.199
will combat some

35:02.150 --> 35:05.199
shrink wrappage of the skin.

35:05.199 --> 35:07.199
Matter of fact,

35:05.199 --> 35:07.199
its our only option.

35:07.199 --> 35:10.159
I hope to God

35:07.199 --> 35:10.159
this does the trick.

35:10.159 --> 35:12.179
I need to take a nap after this.

35:12.179 --> 35:16.230
Alright, lets put this

35:12.179 --> 35:16.230
cartilage over the tip.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.090
Beautiful.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.190

Ive got to tell you something.

Normally, buttock

Is all the major nerves

36:00.170 --> 36:05.190
and blood vessels to the leg,

36:05.190 --> 36:09.230
and so, I irrigated the pocket,

36:05.190 --> 36:09.230
I took the implant out,

36:09.230 --> 36:12.050
and I went, I dont

36:12.050 --> 36:13.170

Before my surgery,

41:38.139 --> 41:42.010
my butt was completely deformed.

41:42.010 --> 41:45.130
It was flat and my butt

41:42.010 --> 41:45.130
implants looked more like

41:45.130 --> 41:48.159
hip implants. Now

41:45.130 --> 41:48.159
thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

41:48.159 --> 41:51.130
I actually have

41:48.159 --> 41:51.130
a butt. Its not a big butt,

41:51.130 --> 41:54.269
but it looks natural

41:51.130 --> 41:54.269
and fits my body perfectly.

41:54.269 --> 41:57.150
Im glad to know

41:54.269 --> 41:57.150
the silicone is gone,

41:57.150 --> 42:02.260
and not having the implants

41:57.150 --> 42:02.260
on my hips feels amazing.

42:02.260 --> 42:05.190
Im no longer

42:02.260 --> 42:05.190
a prisoner of my body.

42:05.190 --> 42:08.139
Yes, hips dont lie.

42:08.139 --> 42:10.170
I think Yuliana looks amazing.

42:10.170 --> 42:12.139
Since the surgery

42:10.170 --> 42:12.139
with Dr. Dubrow,

42:12.139 --> 42:17.010
our relationship has

42:12.139 --> 42:17.010
been significantly better.

42:17.010 --> 42:19.219
All of these

42:17.010 --> 42:19.219

42:19.219 --> 42:22.280
so much mistrust. Its

42:19.219 --> 42:22.280
finally coming to an end.

42:22.280 --> 42:25.159
Its been a very

42:22.280 --> 42:25.159
long and bumpy road,

42:25.159 --> 42:28.159
but a road that has us dusted up

42:28.159 --> 42:30.210
and stronger than ever before.

42:30.210 --> 42:32.269
Ive always felt Julia though,

42:32.269 --> 42:36.050
you just never saw

42:32.269 --> 42:36.050
the beauty that I see.

42:36.050 --> 42:39.170
And when you tell me Julie,

42:36.050 --> 42:39.170
that I need this,

42:39.170 --> 42:41.280
or This doesnt look good".

42:41.280 --> 42:43.250
I was like,

42:41.280 --> 42:43.250
why doesnt she believe me?

42:43.250 --> 42:45.050
No more surgeries.

42:45.050 --> 42:48.050
Juan and I are

42:45.050 --> 42:48.050
building trust again.

anymore secrets.

Im happy to be here, Mom.

42:59.010 --> 43:01.150
Me too, and I am

42:59.010 --> 43:01.150

43:01.150 --> 43:05.159

43:01.150 --> 43:05.159
that Ill never do that again.

I may not have J-Los butt,
