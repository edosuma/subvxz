00:04.234 --> 00:06.636
David, this isn't funny!

00:06.669 --> 00:09.153
I have my first Town
Hall meeting in an hour,

00:09.179 --> 00:10.839
where is my portfolio?!

00:10.874 --> 00:13.843
Uh, why... why would I know
where your portfolio is?

00:13.877 --> 00:16.143
You were bedazzling it last night.

00:16.178 --> 00:17.250
Excuse me?

00:17.274 --> 00:19.815
I haven't bedazzled
anything since I was 22.

00:19.850 --> 00:22.068
David, you were dressed
like a harlequin,

00:22.094 --> 00:24.861
and you were gluing shiny jewels...

00:24.897 --> 00:26.698
perhaps that was just a night terror.

00:26.733 --> 00:29.039
Um... oh God.

00:29.064 --> 00:30.431
Okay.

00:30.455 --> 00:31.640
Oh.

00:31.666 --> 00:33.734
Well! Uh...

00:34.253 --> 00:36.020
Hello.

00:36.045 --> 00:39.545
Hi, uh, I'm-I'm Jake.

00:39.585 --> 00:41.805
Oh, of course you are.

00:41.831 --> 00:44.917
- David?
- Um, Jake, this is my mother.

00:44.951 --> 00:46.685
Listen, I'm really sorry,

00:46.719 --> 00:49.220
I didn't think anybody would be home.

00:49.255 --> 00:51.957
Okay, nobody was supposed to be home.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.792
Nobody was supposed to be home, so...

00:53.826 --> 00:55.093
You were supposed to be at lunch,

00:55.118 --> 00:57.161
why-why are-why were you not at lunch?!

00:57.197 --> 01:00.625
David, stop acting like
a disgruntled pelican!

01:00.767 --> 01:02.533
I came home from lunch
because I realized

01:02.569 --> 01:04.367
- I misplaced my portfolio.
- ... folio.

01:04.403 --> 01:06.015
So we're-I'm gonna...
we're gonna look for it.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.085
- David,
- Oh my God!

01:07.111 --> 01:08.192
we're looking for your
mother's portfol...

01:08.218 --> 01:10.328
Oh. Oh! Okay.

01:10.352 --> 01:13.144
Hello, uh, Johnny Rose. You are?

01:13.179 --> 01:14.947
- Jake.
- Yes, welcome, welcome, Jake.

01:14.980 --> 01:17.483
I see uh, David's made
you feel right at home.

01:17.516 --> 01:18.617
- Okay, Dad!
- John...

01:18.641 --> 01:20.944
No, no, no, I'm just
saying, carry on doing...

01:20.978 --> 01:23.539
whatever you're doing, or not... doing.

01:23.572 --> 01:24.492
- Okay.
- I mean, I see things

01:24.516 --> 01:25.966
- No. Got it, got it...
- are wrapping up here, so...

01:25.992 --> 01:27.292
- so much.
- Oh my God!

01:27.326 --> 01:29.756
- Oh my God!
- Alexis, this is Jake.

01:29.781 --> 01:31.096
We seem to have caught the boys in a...

01:31.131 --> 01:32.497
In an "afternoon delight."

01:32.531 --> 01:34.426
- Is that term still a going thing?
- No, that's no.

01:34.450 --> 01:36.198
- No, never say that again.
- Don't do that.

01:36.223 --> 01:37.753
Um David, I thought we agreed,

01:37.778 --> 01:39.097
only when nobody was home.

01:39.122 --> 01:40.706
Nobody was home!

01:40.740 --> 01:42.933
- Nobody was home!
- Oh, here it is!

01:42.959 --> 01:44.492
Ha ha ha!

01:44.518 --> 01:46.353
Nice to meet you, Jacob.

01:46.378 --> 01:48.180
If you take half as much care of our son

01:48.213 --> 01:49.814
- as you do your physique,
- Okay!

01:49.848 --> 01:51.831
David should be in very good hands.

01:51.871 --> 01:53.347
Yes, well, not-not your hands,

01:53.372 --> 01:56.008
- Mhmm, yep. Bye!
- but uh... generally speaking...

01:56.222 --> 01:57.789
Well, I hope it was worth it.

01:57.823 --> 01:59.691
Okay, I think you can
take a step outside.

01:59.725 --> 02:01.853
You can step outside
while this is happening.

02:01.879 --> 02:03.328
Let him change.

02:03.362 --> 02:05.296
You're like a predator!

02:06.409 --> 02:07.748

Your next big opportunity, that's who.

02:25.485 --> 02:26.884
What opportunity?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.887
Well, Cal's doing big business,

02:28.921 --> 02:31.490
and since you two are sharing an office,

02:31.524 --> 02:34.026
uh, I thought you might
wanna get in on some of it.

02:34.060 --> 02:35.740
Sharing an office?

02:35.765 --> 02:38.796
You've... rented out my office space?!

02:38.831 --> 02:41.545
Well, Johnny, you weren't
exactly paying rent,

02:41.569 --> 02:44.740
and Cal's business is booming.

02:44.826 --> 02:46.834
I should add that
registration is totally free,

02:46.859 --> 02:48.873
there's no charge
whatsoever for registration,

02:48.908 --> 02:50.275
there's just a small monetary...

02:50.310 --> 02:51.802

02:51.828 --> 02:53.740
Antivirus. The guy's amazing.

02:53.765 --> 02:55.646
Okay, you'll be receiving
your CD-ROM in the mail

02:55.682 --> 02:56.819
within the next two weeks,

02:56.843 --> 02:58.417
and you'll know the software is working

02:58.450 --> 03:00.419
if you don't see any changes.

03:00.453 --> 03:02.506
Bob, this sounds like a scam.

03:02.531 --> 03:03.865
Far from it.

03:03.889 --> 03:07.334
No, my-my computer was
riddled with viruses.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.997
I mean, Cal uh, he fixed it,

03:10.022 --> 03:12.280
over the phone!

03:12.558 --> 03:14.973
He didn't even look at my computer!

03:14.997 --> 03:16.558
That's how good he is.

03:16.584 --> 03:19.112
Bob, I've got a meeting
with a client in an hour,

03:19.138 --> 03:21.073
and I cannot be conducting business

03:21.106 --> 03:23.508
with somebody yammering
into the phone beside me!

03:23.543 --> 03:26.411
Johnny, you're putting me
in a bit of a pickle here.

03:26.445 --> 03:29.914
You know, obviously I'd
like to keep you both.

03:30.050 --> 03:31.800
But there's uh...

03:31.825 --> 03:33.384
a cardboard box over there,

03:33.418 --> 03:34.920
you know, if you do
feel like you wanna...

03:34.954 --> 03:37.222
you know, pack up your things.

03:44.820 --> 03:45.913
Hi.

03:46.521 --> 03:48.037
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

03:48.062 --> 03:51.302
Um, what are you...
what are you doing here?

03:51.336 --> 03:53.084
I just popped in to say hello.

03:53.109 --> 03:54.811
Yeah, he came to say hi to me.

03:54.836 --> 03:57.091
Oh... yeah.

03:57.115 --> 03:59.877
Um, and-and what... and um...

03:59.912 --> 04:01.812
how long have you been here for?

04:01.848 --> 04:03.681
Why, are you writing a true crime novel?

04:03.716 --> 04:05.427
I'm just curious.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.451
Just curious about what you guys are...

04:07.486 --> 04:08.986
what you guys are talking about.

04:09.021 --> 04:10.632
About stuff.

04:10.657 --> 04:11.905
Mhmm...

04:12.925 --> 04:14.588
Is that okay with you?

04:14.614 --> 04:16.757
Yeah. Yeah.

04:17.201 --> 04:20.165
Well, I should probably head.

04:20.199 --> 04:22.567
I've got a ton of work to do, so...

04:27.165 --> 04:28.735
- Mmmm!
- Bye.

04:28.761 --> 04:29.838
Bye.

04:31.444 --> 04:32.810
Unnnh!

04:33.252 --> 04:34.759
Ahh...

04:35.411 --> 04:37.514
- I'll be in touch, all right?
- Okay, yeah.

04:37.538 --> 04:38.903
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:46.207 --> 04:48.168
What the flying (bleep)
is going on here?!

04:48.194 --> 04:50.329
I was gonna ask you the same thing!

04:50.355 --> 04:53.064
- What was that?!
- Uh, what was that?!

04:53.098 --> 04:55.237
We're seeing each other!

04:55.534 --> 04:57.536
Okay, we're seeing each other.

04:57.569 --> 05:00.346
He literally came here from my room.

05:01.209 --> 05:05.045
Well, he dropped me off
at work this morning.

05:05.069 --> 05:06.403
He what?!

05:06.427 --> 05:07.983
He dropped me off...

05:08.014 --> 05:09.264
- at work this morning!
- Okay, I get it!

05:09.288 --> 05:11.646
Um, he did not mention that to me.

05:11.670 --> 05:14.685
And... frankly,

05:14.721 --> 05:17.723
I don't know whether I
want your sloppy seconds!

05:17.757 --> 05:19.757
Uh, first of all, who
says they're sloppy,

05:19.792 --> 05:22.817
and second, who's to say we're
not getting his sloppy thirds?!

05:23.889 --> 05:26.798
Who knows how many people he's
got on the go at this point?

05:29.084 --> 05:33.071
Okay, well all I know is
that someone is sloppy...

05:33.105 --> 05:34.706
and it's not me!

05:35.939 --> 05:38.139
Well, hello, everyone!

05:38.165 --> 05:39.798
What time is curtain?

05:39.822 --> 05:41.956
We'll probably start in a few minutes.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.271
Well, it looks like a
full house out there.

05:44.295 --> 05:46.350
Huh! So uh...

05:46.386 --> 05:49.053
is this what everyone's wearing?

05:49.997 --> 05:52.230
Well, I might lose the jacket.

05:52.468 --> 05:55.403
If we look to have
given up on ourselves,

05:55.427 --> 05:57.262
how can we assure our constituents

05:57.295 --> 06:00.014
that we haven't given
up on them as well?

06:00.038 --> 06:02.963
So we look like we've
given up on ourselves?

06:02.988 --> 06:05.603
Could we remember please
that these are real people,

06:05.637 --> 06:08.127
with real problems, people!

06:08.338 --> 06:10.809
And while I can't pretend
to fully understand them,

06:10.843 --> 06:13.636
I can at least attempt to care!

06:13.661 --> 06:15.560
Places, please!

06:17.244 --> 06:19.216
Um, okay, so I downloaded this app,

06:19.252 --> 06:21.276
basically so clients can schedule

06:21.302 --> 06:22.788
their appointments online.

06:22.822 --> 06:25.012
It just saves me answering the phone.

06:25.038 --> 06:26.658
Right, so then...

06:26.692 --> 06:28.492
what will you do?

06:30.738 --> 06:33.153
Thank you for asking, Ted.

06:33.387 --> 06:35.355
And here is my answer.

06:35.379 --> 06:37.560
Um, my answer...

06:37.586 --> 06:39.646
starts by me saying...

06:39.670 --> 06:41.358
So, you two call each other?

06:42.172 --> 06:44.273
Hey! Um, about what?

06:44.298 --> 06:45.630
You're dressed the same.

06:45.656 --> 06:48.091
Ah, never heard that one before.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.524
- How are you?
- I'm good, good.

06:50.723 --> 06:53.973
Tennessee and I are actually
goin' on a trip for a while, so...

06:54.590 --> 06:57.418
Wow, like, Tulum? Or...

06:57.442 --> 06:59.800
Uh, just gonna get in our
car, and drive up the coast,

06:59.826 --> 07:02.009
let the road take us where it wants.

07:02.035 --> 07:04.995
No plans, no phones, no schedules.

07:05.021 --> 07:06.668
Basically my worst nightmare.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.093
Sounds very adventurous.

07:08.117 --> 07:10.721
Yeah, well, I just needed to
get away for a while, you know?

07:10.745 --> 07:13.223
So uh, what's new with you guys?

07:13.605 --> 07:17.209
Well, Alexis came home to
a naked man in her bathroom.

07:18.995 --> 07:21.245
- Cool.
- Um no, it wasn't cool,

07:21.278 --> 07:23.481
because he wasn't actually there for me,

07:23.516 --> 07:24.714
which made everything very awkward,

07:24.740 --> 07:26.550
and uncomfortable for everyone.

07:26.586 --> 07:28.519
Well, you're free to use
the barn while I'm away.

07:28.553 --> 07:30.254
You know, if you need some privacy.

07:30.278 --> 07:32.043
I was actually looking for
someone to water the plants,

07:32.067 --> 07:33.901
and check over the place, so...

07:33.995 --> 07:35.526
Oh, well, thank you, Mutt.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.699
That actually might be good for me.

07:37.778 --> 07:39.730
Well, we're leaving this
afternoon, so you know,

07:39.764 --> 07:42.100
just swing by and grab the keys.

07:42.824 --> 07:44.521
That's very generous.

07:46.086 --> 07:47.442
Is that weird?

07:49.098 --> 07:50.473
Parents are complaining

07:50.499 --> 07:53.978
that they're struggling to get off
work early enough to pick up their kids,

07:54.019 --> 07:55.721
and so that's why we
would like to extend

07:55.747 --> 07:58.576
the after school daycare
program by half an hour.

08:01.293 --> 08:04.130
That's an idea we'll...

08:04.389 --> 08:06.380
give some real thought to.

08:06.406 --> 08:08.505
Spoken like a true politician.

08:09.718 --> 08:12.206
Ah! Vivacity aside,

08:12.230 --> 08:14.723
our children's safety
is no laughing matter.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.130
As a mother who once
invested a great deal

08:17.156 --> 08:20.247
of time and money into her children,

08:20.273 --> 08:21.848
I, for one, stand by

08:21.874 --> 08:24.201
the request to extend
the hours of the daycare.

08:26.598 --> 08:30.456
One might think that an additional
30 minutes will have no impact,

08:30.481 --> 08:32.551
but you tell that to the mother

08:32.585 --> 08:35.385
whose manicurist just
applied the wrong color,

08:35.421 --> 08:37.495
and must start all over again,

08:37.520 --> 08:41.284
or the father who got stuck in a mine!

08:41.674 --> 08:44.191
That extra half hour
could be the difference

08:44.216 --> 08:46.268
between a child who
gets picked up safely,

08:46.293 --> 08:48.567
and one who wanders the street,

08:48.600 --> 08:53.229
waiting for a dust-covered man
to emerge from the darkness!

08:53.254 --> 08:54.995
We do wait with the kids...

08:55.020 --> 08:58.056
Is that really what
we want for our town?

08:58.277 --> 09:00.090
Homeless toddlers?!

09:00.144 --> 09:01.788
Tugging at your pant legs?!

09:01.813 --> 09:04.807
Okay Moira, I think
you've made your point.

09:04.831 --> 09:07.552
I assure you, council
will examine this issue

09:07.586 --> 09:09.653
thoroughly and carefully.

09:09.688 --> 09:12.724
Your children will be
safe, that is a promise!

09:19.514 --> 09:22.208
Moira, what are you doing?
You undermined my authority!

09:22.232 --> 09:24.895
We were losing our audience!
You saw the walkouts.

09:24.913 --> 09:26.153
And on opening night!

09:26.178 --> 09:27.889
- This isn't a theatre!
- Isn't it?

09:27.914 --> 09:30.650
Look, you can't go making
blind promises to these people!

09:30.684 --> 09:32.365
This isn't "Sunrise Bay,"

09:32.389 --> 09:34.754
where everybody lives
in a perfect dream world!

09:34.788 --> 09:35.772
I'll have you know,

09:35.797 --> 09:37.790
Sunrise Bay was a coastal community

09:37.825 --> 09:40.403
plagued by a centuries-old curse!

09:40.428 --> 09:42.095
I hate to jump in here,

09:42.129 --> 09:45.365
but you told me I should use
the bathroom during the break,

09:45.399 --> 09:48.000
and uh, the line's getting really long!

09:48.036 --> 09:49.865
- Go for it, Bob.
- Ohhh!

09:49.889 --> 09:52.809
Ronnie, you have whispers
of a maternal instinct.

09:52.835 --> 09:54.508
Isn't this issue important to you?

09:54.542 --> 09:57.044
It's not a matter of importance,
it's a matter of money!

09:57.070 --> 09:58.403
Then find the money!

09:58.428 --> 10:00.802
Ohhh, okay, why don't I just tiptoe

10:00.827 --> 10:02.975
into my orchard of money trees,

10:03.017 --> 10:05.514
and fill my basket with money for you!

10:05.583 --> 10:06.817
And while we're at it,

10:06.842 --> 10:09.278
why don't I gather up
some diamond carrots,

10:09.302 --> 10:11.222
and some golden potatoes!

10:11.264 --> 10:12.808
And I don't mean the
kind of potatoes you eat,

10:12.833 --> 10:13.966
I mean, the...

10:13.991 --> 10:16.466
potatoes that are made
out of actual gold.

10:16.863 --> 10:18.558
Okay, there must be some solution.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.432
To the problem you just caused?

10:20.597 --> 10:22.942
I'm sure you'll figure somethin' out.

10:23.970 --> 10:26.138
Oh, welcome to the show.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.442
Well, first, I wanna say thank you, Amy,

10:31.476 --> 10:33.477
for taking the time to see me today.

10:33.513 --> 10:35.113
It's actually Amygrace.

10:35.148 --> 10:38.149
Amygrace, well, apologies.

10:38.183 --> 10:40.351
It's funny, 'cause I
remember when our families

10:40.385 --> 10:43.465
used to vacation together,
you were just "Little Amy."

10:43.490 --> 10:45.216
I've always been Amygrace.

10:45.241 --> 10:46.520
Ah...

10:46.687 --> 10:49.894
well then, just call me Johnnymichael.

10:55.056 --> 10:58.125
You know, I-I'm very
interested in your business,

10:58.150 --> 10:59.837
Amy... grace.

10:59.871 --> 11:01.340
It's been very fulfilling.

11:01.374 --> 11:04.643
Yeah. "Screamnastics."

11:04.677 --> 11:07.993
"Screamnastics," I read that's
a combination of gymnastics

11:08.018 --> 11:10.071
and um... screaming?

11:10.096 --> 11:12.393
Scream therapy, yes.

11:12.418 --> 11:14.346
And extreme juicing.

11:14.721 --> 11:18.123
Ah well, I'm a big juice fan myself.

11:18.157 --> 11:19.524
Just so you know, Mr. Rose,

11:19.558 --> 11:20.958
most orange juices have

11:20.994 --> 11:23.161
frighteningly high sugar levels.

11:23.196 --> 11:24.663
Okay...

11:25.588 --> 11:28.066
So, here's the important thing.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.907
I believe this town
could be the perfect spot

11:30.932 --> 11:32.803
for your next franchise.

11:32.932 --> 11:34.840
Here's the issue, Mr. Rose,

11:34.874 --> 11:36.586
I've been touring small towns,

11:36.611 --> 11:39.745
in an extensive market research trip.

11:39.778 --> 11:41.712
And unfortunately,
what we're discovering

11:41.748 --> 11:45.331
is that most "rural" communities

11:45.355 --> 11:48.220
just don't have the
same interest in health.

11:48.254 --> 11:49.855
Or wellness.

11:49.889 --> 11:50.984
Or what we like to call,

11:51.009 --> 11:54.115
"Screamnastic inner/outer
beauty connectivity."

11:54.259 --> 11:56.130
Well, I know a lot of people here

11:56.155 --> 11:59.322
who are very connected to
their inner and outer beauty.

11:59.365 --> 12:01.166
And even more who could use

12:01.200 --> 12:05.333
some of that "Screamnastic"
connect... tivity.

12:05.359 --> 12:07.239
I love your enthusiasm, Mr. Rose.

12:07.273 --> 12:08.673
It's very "Screamnastic."

12:08.707 --> 12:12.043
Well, this town is very
"Screamnastic," Amygrace.

12:12.077 --> 12:15.139
Why don't we circle back
in I don't know, six months,

12:15.178 --> 12:17.725
and see how things are going then?

12:17.750 --> 12:20.893
Yes, sure, sure, sure. We can do that.

12:20.919 --> 12:22.897
Tell you what, why not
make it three months?

12:22.922 --> 12:24.655
Let's circle back in three months,

12:24.682 --> 12:26.250
and that way we might be able to...

12:26.274 --> 12:28.025
open a "Screamnasium" by Christmas.

12:28.061 --> 12:29.860
Oh, we don't call them that.

12:29.895 --> 12:32.530
But it's been so great
seeing you, Mr. Rose.

12:32.565 --> 12:34.032
And my parents say hi, by the way.

12:34.067 --> 12:36.052
They were beside themselves
when they found out

12:36.077 --> 12:37.195
what happened to you guys.

12:37.220 --> 12:38.253
Well, we're okay.

12:38.278 --> 12:39.989
We're doing just fine, thank you.

12:40.014 --> 12:41.780
Anyway, you take care.

12:42.015 --> 12:43.383
You too.

Oh, hey.

13:05.063 --> 13:06.798

I'm just putting the
last coat on it now.

13:08.432 --> 13:09.861
- Ah.
- I think I'm getting a little high...

13:09.912 --> 13:11.745
- from the fumes.
- Oh, that's nice.

13:11.770 --> 13:14.504
Uh, we know that you're
seeing both of us.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.350
- So...
- Okay.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.986
Wait, did you not know that?

13:18.011 --> 13:19.911
Uh, no, we did not.

13:19.946 --> 13:21.679
I mean, when you kissed
us both on the mouth

13:21.713 --> 13:24.014
we sort of pieced it together.

13:24.049 --> 13:26.751
Listen, I don't want to cause any drama.

13:26.786 --> 13:28.286
- We don't want any drama!
- Who wants drama?

13:28.321 --> 13:30.221
Nobody... does.

13:31.215 --> 13:33.024
Some clarity would've been nice.

13:33.058 --> 13:34.692
- You know?
- Totally, yeah.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.051
I just uh...

13:36.076 --> 13:38.144
I assumed you guys were cool with it.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.575
Yeah, I don't think it's a
matter of not being cool with it,

13:40.600 --> 13:42.801
I don't think that's...
that's not what this is,

13:42.835 --> 13:45.971
it's um, what this
is, is a clarity thing.

13:45.996 --> 13:47.261
Yeah.

13:47.874 --> 13:49.841
So you are cool with it?

13:50.668 --> 13:53.278
Yeah, I'm cool with it now.

13:53.457 --> 13:56.380
I'm not not cool with it.

13:56.415 --> 13:58.385
I don't think that was
ever the thing, so...

13:58.418 --> 14:00.888
I don't think anybody's not cool here.

Well, hello again, you beautiful people.

14:15.835 --> 14:18.144
I would love to circle
back to this matter

14:18.169 --> 14:20.838
of the extended daycare hours.

14:20.873 --> 14:23.741
Although I made some excellent points,

14:23.775 --> 14:26.945
in the interest of a fair
and balanced discussion,

14:26.979 --> 14:30.278
I will now argue the
other side of the issue.

14:33.567 --> 14:37.355
One of my fondest memories
from childhood were weekdays,

14:37.389 --> 14:40.114
between 5:30 and 6 P.M.

14:40.139 --> 14:41.927
That was our time!

14:41.951 --> 14:43.567
And we would've fought anyone

14:43.592 --> 14:45.764
who dared try to take it away from us.

14:45.798 --> 14:48.809
So you're not extending the hours?

14:50.037 --> 14:53.261
Do we really want Big Brother
programming every waking minute

14:53.287 --> 14:55.105
of our children's lives?!

14:55.140 --> 14:57.442
So is that a yes or a no, I...

14:57.467 --> 14:59.961
- It's an absolutely.
- Absolutely what?

14:59.985 --> 15:01.921
Absolutely crucial...

15:04.115 --> 15:06.368
absolutely crucial!

15:07.285 --> 15:09.306
Crucial that we...

15:09.500 --> 15:11.057
approach-that...

15:11.082 --> 15:13.291
that we entertain every...

15:13.326 --> 15:15.289
- approach. I don't...
- Ahem!

15:15.495 --> 15:17.024
We'll think about it.

15:29.135 --> 15:30.602
Alexis!

15:31.220 --> 15:32.553
What's...

15:33.788 --> 15:35.123
what's up?

15:35.148 --> 15:36.743
Hey, it's you.

15:36.768 --> 15:40.350
Um, we just came by to pick
up the keys for the barn.

15:40.739 --> 15:43.437
The keys to... this barn?

15:43.489 --> 15:46.024
Yeah, Mutt asked me to just pop by,

15:46.057 --> 15:49.046
and keep an eye on the
place while you are gone.

15:49.995 --> 15:51.562
Okay.

15:51.831 --> 15:53.631
This is just the first
I'm hearing about it,

15:53.665 --> 15:55.466
which is fine.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.201
If I had known you were
staying at our place,

15:57.235 --> 15:59.203
I would've cleaned the
sheets for you guys.

15:59.238 --> 16:00.833
Oh no, we're not together.

16:00.859 --> 16:03.312
You literally could not
have said that any faster.

16:04.349 --> 16:07.090
Hey babe, I'm just
getting caught up here.

16:07.115 --> 16:10.249
So, Alexis is crashing at our place?

16:10.274 --> 16:11.546
Not crashing.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.660
It just caught me off
guard, 'cause I didn't know

16:13.686 --> 16:15.921
that there was an arrangement here.

16:15.955 --> 16:17.684
I don't know about arrangement,

16:17.710 --> 16:19.390
it just sorta happened.

16:19.424 --> 16:21.177
You're the one who said you
don't like to plan things.

16:21.201 --> 16:23.615
Well, I like to plan things sometimes.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.359
Uh, so Tennessee,

16:25.384 --> 16:27.666
Mutt tells us that you guys
are heading up the coast?

16:27.700 --> 16:29.591
- Yes!
- Yeah, we're meeting some friends.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.553
We're going on a pinecone harvest.

16:32.128 --> 16:34.205
Pinecone harvest?

16:34.240 --> 16:35.889
We're picking pinecones.

16:35.914 --> 16:38.143
I got this old compass at a flea market;

16:38.177 --> 16:41.111
we're just gonna drive
until we see the pine trees.

16:41.147 --> 16:44.349
Hmm, that sounds like it is gonna be...

16:44.383 --> 16:46.116
super fun and intense.

16:46.428 --> 16:48.687
Mutt, you didn't tell me about...

16:48.721 --> 16:50.956
Yeah, the pinecones.

16:50.990 --> 16:53.191
So, we know roughly where we're going.

16:53.225 --> 16:55.192
I'm pretty sure the
compass is broken, though.

16:55.226 --> 16:58.830
Well, I think that it's better
to just freefall into it.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.437
- Yes.
- Yeah, but like I said,

17:01.461 --> 17:02.859
it wouldn't hurt to bring a map.

17:02.884 --> 17:04.511
Anyway, you pick the pinecones,

17:04.537 --> 17:05.971
and they harvest the seeds.

17:05.996 --> 17:08.893
It sounds like this is
going to be like, a very um,

17:08.944 --> 17:12.076
cathartic journey for you guys.

17:13.944 --> 17:16.624
- Here's hoping.
- Hmm! Yeah.

17:16.951 --> 17:18.650
So uh, here's the keys.

17:18.683 --> 17:21.185
And take care of the place.

17:21.220 --> 17:22.685
Don't throw any parties.

17:22.721 --> 17:24.201
Pinky swear.

17:24.824 --> 17:27.258
Hmm, we should probably get going.

17:27.291 --> 17:28.727
We were going...

17:28.760 --> 17:31.061
to hit the hot springs
before the sun sets!

17:31.096 --> 17:32.631
Oh yeah, definitely
want to get a soak in,

17:32.664 --> 17:34.766
before you tackle the cones.

17:34.799 --> 17:37.402
Which you must really be...

17:37.435 --> 17:39.257
"pining" for by now!

17:39.281 --> 17:41.240
Okay. Okay!

17:41.266 --> 17:43.740
Well, safe travels.

17:45.845 --> 17:46.921
Yeah, that was weird.

19:32.183 --> 19:34.251
all the wonders of

19:34.286 --> 19:36.471

20:01.313 --> 20:03.146
I wouldn't have gotten
out of bed this morning.

20:03.172 --> 20:06.273
Children, have some respect
for your father's condition.

20:06.308 --> 20:07.976
I'm feeling fine, Moira.

20:08.009 --> 20:10.811
- You don't look fine.
- I'm fine!

20:11.047 --> 20:12.513
Okay...

20:12.548 --> 20:14.481
All right, ready to order?

20:14.517 --> 20:15.983
Yeah, toast...

20:16.018 --> 20:19.201
dry toast, and more coffee, please.

20:19.521 --> 20:22.084
And I know it's early, but
I'm kind of feeling like,

20:22.108 --> 20:23.791
a big piece of fish.

20:23.817 --> 20:25.028
Mm!

20:25.061 --> 20:28.538
Um... and I'll have a bowl of room
temperature hollandaise sauce, please.

20:28.563 --> 20:30.397
Oh, that's funny, very funny.

20:30.432 --> 20:31.780
- Don't listen to them, John.
- Very funny.

20:31.806 --> 20:34.733
Don't listen and pick a point
on the wall if you need to.

20:34.915 --> 20:37.351
Just a fruit cup for me, please.

20:37.807 --> 20:39.207
Anything else?

20:39.240 --> 20:41.223
Um yeah, I would love
to order something else,

20:41.249 --> 20:44.132
but I'm just having
trouble... seeing the menu.

20:44.156 --> 20:45.358
Yeah, so um...

20:45.384 --> 20:47.382
if we could somehow
make it brighter in here?

20:47.406 --> 20:49.384
Okay, you know what, kids? Stop it.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.958
Okay, well, I will be
right back with the toast,

20:51.982 --> 20:54.522
fruit, fish, and... sauce.

20:54.548 --> 20:56.397
- Thanks.
- Perfect.

20:56.874 --> 20:58.559
Have you no empathy?!

20:58.594 --> 21:01.537
Stop persecuting your father,
we all know he's in a bad way.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.961
No bad way, Moira,

21:02.997 --> 21:05.365
I'm actually feeling pretty good.

21:05.398 --> 21:09.132
Well I, for one think we should
celebrate your resilience!

21:09.270 --> 21:10.476
A toast!

21:10.500 --> 21:12.108
A toast!

21:12.134 --> 21:14.387
All right, you know what,
I'm sitting at another table.

Alexis seems to think you like me more.

Alexis, don't be ridiculous.

21:25.421 --> 21:27.085
It's exactly the kind of paranoia

that makes me wary of
spending time with you.
