Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:02.576 --> 00:04.832
All right. I--I know exactly
what I'm doing.

00:04.935 --> 00:07.025
You had your evaluation
with Dr. Sumner last night.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.384
He called me with
some concerns.

00:08.409 --> 00:11.534
It is important that you be
completely honest with me

00:11.559 --> 00:14.769
so that I can make recommendation
for your continued care...

00:14.794 --> 00:16.344
Whatever that may be.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.402
I don't want to be
recommitted.

00:19.470 --> 00:21.604
I can't go back there.

00:21.672 --> 00:23.439
- What are you seeing?
- A young man.

00:23.507 --> 00:25.208
We have a problem.

00:25.276 --> 00:27.398
It is impossible.
He was erased.

00:27.465 --> 00:30.703
And yet traces of him
continue to bleed through.

00:30.771 --> 00:32.759
Walter--does he look
like this?

00:32.828 --> 00:36.317
I-I've been seeing him in my
dreams for the past three weeks.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.348
If we're both seeing
the same man, he must be real.

00:38.416 --> 00:40.745
We have to find him!

02:31.212 --> 02:32.245
Hi, Olivia.

02:32.313 --> 02:35.015
Hey.

02:35.082 --> 02:36.617
Did I just step
on a peanut?

02:36.685 --> 02:39.786
You're lucky that I convinced
him not to use shrimp.

02:39.854 --> 02:43.257
Olivia,
how nice of you to visit.

02:43.325 --> 02:45.092
Well, technically,
I'm not really visiting,

02:45.160 --> 02:47.061
because I-I work here.

02:49.331 --> 02:50.965
Oh, of course.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.633
<i>Hey, Walter,</i>

02:52.701 --> 02:54.936
why don't you show Olivia
what you're doing?

02:55.004 --> 02:58.340
Oh, I want to capture
the apparition

02:58.407 --> 03:01.142
that's been haunting us
on film.

03:01.210 --> 03:05.113
I have the power
of 28 cameras going here.

03:05.181 --> 03:07.682
Walter, if you think that it's
possible to capture him on film,

03:07.750 --> 03:09.851
why didn't you just use
a single video camera?

03:09.919 --> 03:12.187
I believe the apparition

03:12.254 --> 03:15.122
may be out of phase
with our reality.

03:15.190 --> 03:18.625
And for that reason, he is not
visible from all directions.

03:18.693 --> 03:23.029
Instead, he's visible only
from one specific angle,

03:23.097 --> 03:25.331
which is why I can see him
and no one else can.

03:25.399 --> 03:31.571
So. Multiple cameras taking
pictures from multiple angles.

03:31.638 --> 03:32.839
When he shows up again,

03:32.907 --> 03:36.109
I'll have maximized the odds
of capturing his image,

03:36.177 --> 03:40.113
an idea I got from the fight
sequences in <i>The Matrix.</i>

03:40.181 --> 03:41.615
<i>He watched it last night</i>

03:41.682 --> 03:43.416
to try and take his mind
off his fear.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.818
<i>Now I welcome</i>
<i>his visitation.</i>

03:50.023 --> 03:51.256
Any more dreams?

03:51.324 --> 03:54.059
Did he visit again?

03:54.127 --> 03:55.594
No.

03:55.662 --> 03:58.130
But something else did.

04:01.067 --> 04:05.269
When I woke up this morning,
there was some kind of energy

04:05.337 --> 04:08.039
hovering above my bed.

04:08.106 --> 04:09.541
I know it sounds crazy,

04:09.608 --> 04:11.309
but it was making
some kind of droning noise,

04:11.377 --> 04:13.577
and it seemed to be...

04:13.645 --> 04:16.113
or it <i>was</i> powerful.

04:16.180 --> 04:17.848
What did it do?

04:17.915 --> 04:20.350
There were all these
metal objects

04:20.416 --> 04:24.387
gathered in a pile on the floor,
like it was collecting.

04:30.694 --> 04:33.496
It touched me.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.832
Ohh...
<i>Oh, my.</i>

04:40.037 --> 04:43.973
Walter, do you think
that I'm causing this...

04:44.041 --> 04:46.142
like when I was a child

04:46.210 --> 04:48.377
and I set fire to the room?

04:50.046 --> 04:52.147
Let's get a scraping
for DNA.

04:52.215 --> 04:53.882
There's no time to waste.

04:53.950 --> 04:57.185
Maybe we can deduce
exactly what form of energy

04:57.252 --> 04:59.587
is responsible for this.

05:33.556 --> 05:34.923
<i>That should do it.</i>

05:42.965 --> 05:44.966
- Here you go, Walter.
- Thank you.

05:47.336 --> 05:49.103
I'm going to need

05:49.171 --> 05:51.172
an atmospheric sample
from your apartment

05:51.240 --> 05:52.574
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

05:52.642 --> 05:54.710
Of course.

06:06.557 --> 06:08.725
<i>Get closer</i>
<i>to the metal objects.</i>

06:08.793 --> 06:10.093
<i>Take a reading there now.</i>

06:11.462 --> 06:12.596
Oh. It's higher.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.665
<i>Two whole rads</i>
<i>at this proximity.</i>

06:14.732 --> 06:16.533
Did you happen to leave
a window open?

06:16.600 --> 06:18.368
Uh, yeah.
The bedroom window was open.

06:18.435 --> 06:20.537
<i>Agent Dunham,</i>
<i>go to another room.</i>

06:20.604 --> 06:22.172
The bathroom, say.

06:22.239 --> 06:24.574
And find anything metal
so they can test

06:24.641 --> 06:27.610
whether those metal objects
have become magnetized.

06:31.348 --> 06:32.849
What was that?

06:32.917 --> 06:34.217
<i>What's what?</i>

06:34.285 --> 06:36.386
I'm getting
some kind of feedback.

06:36.453 --> 06:37.854
<i>Astrid!</i>
- <i>What's wrong?</i>

06:37.922 --> 06:38.922
What's happening?

06:41.959 --> 06:44.494
<i>Olivia!</i>

06:44.562 --> 06:45.796
What's going on
in there?

06:45.864 --> 06:48.331
Walter, what are you
talking about?

06:48.399 --> 06:49.332
<i>Astrid!</i>

06:49.400 --> 06:51.401
<i>What's wrong?</i>

06:56.841 --> 06:58.475
Olivia!

06:58.542 --> 07:00.611

07:44.373 --> 07:45.539
<i>that your equipment</i>

07:45.607 --> 07:47.341

07:47.408 --> 07:49.810
How is that even possible?

07:49.878 --> 07:52.079
Whatever it is,

07:52.146 --> 07:56.015
it seemed
somehow to affect time.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.152
<i>What are you thinking,</i>
<i>Walter?</i>

08:00.220 --> 08:03.355
I'm not sure it caused
a time effect before.

08:03.422 --> 08:04.956
<i>Before?</i>

08:05.024 --> 08:07.092
I thought you said you'd never
seen anything like this?

08:07.160 --> 08:08.460
<i>Exactly like this, no,</i>

08:08.528 --> 08:10.796
but something similar.

08:10.864 --> 08:14.900
25 years ago, when Belly and I
did the Cortexiphan trials,

08:14.967 --> 08:16.768
<i>there was a boy who displayed</i>

08:16.835 --> 08:18.836
<i>the beginnings of an ability</i>
<i>for astral projection.</i>

08:18.904 --> 08:20.137
Astral projection?

08:20.205 --> 08:22.873
The ability to travel outside
the physical body.

08:22.941 --> 08:24.441
<i>And the matter to energy</i>
<i>transformation</i>

08:24.509 --> 08:26.510
<i>had similar results.</i>

08:26.578 --> 08:32.149
That would explain the radiation
levels in Olivia's apartment.

08:32.216 --> 08:34.818
But the ability came
with a harmful side effect.

08:34.885 --> 08:37.154
Every time he astral projected,

08:37.222 --> 08:39.722
he would create a distortion
in the magnetic field

08:39.791 --> 08:43.159
and attract metal objects
to him.

08:43.227 --> 08:44.460
Even if you're right,

08:44.528 --> 08:46.262
what does that
have to do with me?

08:46.330 --> 08:48.097
I mean, like you said,
it was 25 years ago.

08:48.165 --> 08:51.233
Belly always theorized
that the Cortexiphan children

08:51.301 --> 08:53.769
would share a psychic link,

08:53.837 --> 08:56.538
<i>a deep emotional bond</i>

08:56.606 --> 08:58.073
because of their
shared experience.

08:58.140 --> 09:01.876
Maybe this person
is trying to reach out to you,

09:01.944 --> 09:06.114
and the harmful side effects
are unintentional.

09:06.181 --> 09:07.916
But why me,
and why now?

09:07.984 --> 09:09.517
<i>I can't answer that.</i>

09:09.585 --> 09:12.053
But I can say that...

09:12.121 --> 09:14.389
some of the children
didn't handle the treatments

09:14.457 --> 09:17.859
as well as you did.

09:17.927 --> 09:21.897
Some had adverse reactions...

09:21.964 --> 09:24.533
emotionally.

09:26.403 --> 09:29.038
You were always the strongest.

09:29.105 --> 09:32.142
<i>The others recognized that.</i>

09:32.209 --> 09:35.379
<i>You were always</i>
<i>their favorite.</i>

09:39.351 --> 09:41.452
It burned you
by touching you.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.055
It trapped you in a room.

09:44.123 --> 09:46.324
Who's to say
what will happen next time?

09:46.392 --> 09:49.394
We have to find him
before he does more damage.

09:49.461 --> 09:52.631
So what was his name?

09:56.635 --> 09:59.838
I remember!
He was subject 9.

10:03.642 --> 10:07.078
Nanotechnology--
the bloom is not off the rose.

10:07.146 --> 10:09.513
Because
of the far-ranging claims

10:09.581 --> 10:11.815
that have been made
about potential applications

10:11.883 --> 10:13.483
of nanotechnology,

10:13.551 --> 10:16.052
a number of serious concerns
have been raised

10:16.120 --> 10:19.489
about how this will affect
our society if realized

10:19.557 --> 10:22.925
and what actions,
if any are deemed appropriate,

10:22.993 --> 10:25.361
might be needed to mitigate
these risks.

10:25.429 --> 10:29.733
This is not
Massive Dynamic's concern.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.669
We create technology.

10:32.737 --> 10:38.142
How it is used
is not our concern.

10:38.209 --> 10:40.611
We just own the patents.

10:42.147 --> 10:44.916
The Cortexiphan files
were sealed for 20 years.

10:44.984 --> 10:47.152
I'm not even sure
if all of them still exist.

10:47.219 --> 10:50.088
The files were lost,
so to speak.

10:50.156 --> 10:52.624
We never destroyed files!

10:52.692 --> 10:54.159
Maybe she did.

10:54.227 --> 10:55.494
Viper!

10:55.562 --> 10:57.163
Don't make me
turn you off.

10:57.230 --> 10:58.464
Well, tell her what I said.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.034
Ask her why
she destroyed files.

11:01.102 --> 11:02.035
Go on, ask her!

11:02.103 --> 11:04.237
Maybe you can ask Walter

11:04.305 --> 11:05.872
<i>if he remembers</i>
<i>what group the boy was in.</i>

11:05.940 --> 11:07.040
I mean, that may help.

11:07.108 --> 11:09.676
Of course.
Walter, did you hear that?

11:09.744 --> 11:12.479
Yes. Her voice goes
right into my inner ear

11:12.546 --> 11:14.581
and rattled around
like razor blades.

11:14.648 --> 11:15.682
Of course I heard it.
Tell her to go--

11:15.750 --> 11:18.084
He said
that he is not sure,

11:18.152 --> 11:19.686
<i>but thank you</i>
<i>for the suggestion.</i>

11:19.753 --> 11:20.987
I did not say that!

11:21.054 --> 11:22.822
Walter has said many things
to me over the years,

11:22.889 --> 11:25.424
but "thank you"
was never one of them.

11:27.627 --> 11:30.829
A word, Olivia?

11:30.896 --> 11:33.097
I'll see you in there.

11:34.399 --> 11:36.667
So you told me
about the fringe event,

11:36.735 --> 11:39.536
but I think you left
something out.

11:39.604 --> 11:43.606
It's happening to you,
isn't it?

11:45.376 --> 11:47.044
Now, come on.

11:47.111 --> 11:49.012
I haven't seen this much fear
in your face

11:49.080 --> 11:52.049
since Bobby Hastings
asked you to the prom.

11:56.655 --> 11:58.689
So what can I do
to help you, dear?

11:58.757 --> 12:00.558
You've done it.

12:00.626 --> 12:02.493
Walter thinks he knows
how to deal with it.

12:02.561 --> 12:05.363
We just need to find
the file.

12:07.933 --> 12:10.767
So what were these trials
all about, anyway?

12:10.835 --> 12:14.171
Walter and William Bell
thought that children

12:14.238 --> 12:19.209
had untapped
extrasensory capabilities--

12:19.277 --> 12:22.579
<i>capabilities that</i>
<i>are socialized out of us</i>

12:22.647 --> 12:23.847
<i>when we grow up.</i>

12:23.915 --> 12:25.883
<i>They wanted to tap</i>
<i>into those abilities--</i>

12:25.950 --> 12:31.155
<i>things like telekinesis,</i>
<i>pyrokinesis,</i>

12:31.223 --> 12:33.924
even the ability to cross over
to another Universe

12:33.992 --> 12:35.759
without a bridge.

12:35.827 --> 12:40.130
And so they...
experimented on kids.

12:41.832 --> 12:43.967
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:54.146 --> 12:55.413
What happened
to the program?

12:55.481 --> 12:58.750
I left.
I ran away.

12:58.818 --> 13:01.553
Walter said he and Bell
shut it down

13:01.621 --> 13:04.088
a few years after that.

13:05.924 --> 13:07.325
Here he is.

13:16.635 --> 13:19.537
His name's Cameron James.

13:26.177 --> 13:28.812
Walter, what are you doing?

13:28.879 --> 13:31.547
Going with Agent Dunham,
of course.

13:31.614 --> 13:33.349
Now that we know who he is

13:33.417 --> 13:35.617
and where we have to go
to find him.

13:35.685 --> 13:38.420
Walter, you haven't left
the lab in three years.

13:40.956 --> 13:42.524
You could be killed.

13:42.591 --> 13:45.326
<i>I know the patient.</i>
<i>I know his capabilities.</i>

13:45.394 --> 13:47.562
You do not.
You need me.

13:47.629 --> 13:50.665
Without me,
you can do nothing.

13:50.733 --> 13:53.534
Claire, will you please man
the cameras in my absence?

13:53.601 --> 13:56.737
Really, Claire?

13:56.804 --> 13:59.105
That doesn't even start
with an "A."

14:05.045 --> 14:06.712
If you don't mind,

14:06.780 --> 14:09.182
I think I should urinate
before we leave.

14:09.250 --> 14:13.252
Don't worry.
I've packed us sandwiches.

14:33.185 --> 14:34.586
Oh!

14:41.957 --> 14:44.925
- You okay?
- Yes. Perfectly fine.

14:44.992 --> 14:46.793
<i>Peachy.</i>

14:46.861 --> 14:48.161
You got a problem?

14:48.229 --> 14:50.263
Fresh air...

14:50.331 --> 14:52.332
I'd forgotten
how much I love it.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.534
Ah!

14:56.236 --> 14:58.738
I should've gotten
out of the lab years ago.

15:11.318 --> 15:14.354
It must be
nearly 6:00.

15:14.421 --> 15:17.090
I suppose we could wait
for him to get home,

15:17.158 --> 15:21.027
or perhaps some of the neighbors
know where he works.

15:24.699 --> 15:26.099
<i>Can we do that?</i>

15:26.167 --> 15:27.267
Do what?

15:27.335 --> 15:30.971
We got here,
and the door was unlocked.

15:31.039 --> 15:33.374
Splendid.

15:33.441 --> 15:34.775
Hello?

15:45.118 --> 15:46.652
We're in the wrong place.

15:46.720 --> 15:50.123
<i>All this mail is addressed</i>
<i>to Mark Little.</i>

15:50.190 --> 15:51.858
Cameron James
must have moved on.

15:51.925 --> 15:53.893
<i>No. He still lives here.</i>

15:53.961 --> 15:55.762
Look around.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.130
There's no metal anywhere.

15:57.197 --> 16:01.868
He's even changed
the light fixtures.

16:01.935 --> 16:03.870
Hey.
Who are you?

16:03.938 --> 16:06.539
What are you doing in here?

16:06.607 --> 16:08.674
Agent Dunham. FBI.

16:08.742 --> 16:09.776
Oh.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.111
We're looking
for a Mark Little.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.246
You wouldn't happen to know
where we could find him?

16:13.314 --> 16:15.715
Is he--is he in trouble?

16:15.783 --> 16:17.016
He looked like the sort

16:17.084 --> 16:18.518
who could get
into all sorts of trouble.

16:18.585 --> 16:19.986
<i>We're not sure.</i>

16:20.054 --> 16:22.655
<i>That's why we wanted</i>
<i>to ask him some questions.</i>

16:22.723 --> 16:24.790
I'm Walter Bishop.
It's nice to meet you.

16:27.594 --> 16:30.729
Mark--uh, he won't be back
till tomorrow morning.

16:30.797 --> 16:33.364
He drives a supply truck
for a furniture company

16:33.432 --> 16:34.799
back and forth to Maine.

16:34.867 --> 16:37.535
At least that's what
he says he does.

16:37.603 --> 16:39.037
You never can tell
with people.

16:39.104 --> 16:41.272
So tomorrow morning--
you're sure?

16:41.340 --> 16:43.074
Yeah. He's usually
back by 10:00.

16:43.142 --> 16:44.309
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:47.714 --> 16:49.849
$200 a night.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.818
Look at this room.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.187
It's a veritable
petri dish.

16:54.255 --> 16:56.390
I can't imagine what I would see
with a black light.

16:56.457 --> 16:58.225
Or worse, I can imagine.

16:58.293 --> 16:59.961
Here.

17:01.497 --> 17:05.032
It also controls
the temperature and the lights.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.101
And--and this is
for the TV.

17:07.169 --> 17:09.837
Of course, if Belly were still
here, he'd be delighted.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.573
You know, he and I
used to argue about this.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.742
At what point does technology
outpace its usefulness?

17:14.810 --> 17:17.846
Walter, I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

17:19.348 --> 17:22.317
Can I get you anything
before I go?

17:22.385 --> 17:24.118
Perhaps a glass of water?

17:24.186 --> 17:26.755
Do you have any idea
how many viruses

17:26.823 --> 17:28.658
a simple water glass
can carry?

17:28.726 --> 17:29.926
Okay.

17:29.994 --> 17:33.297
Well, if you need me,
I'm right next door.

18:18.411 --> 18:20.212
Walter.

18:22.716 --> 18:24.650
Walter!

18:24.718 --> 18:26.118
Walter, it's me.

18:29.089 --> 18:30.188
I'm coming in.

18:30.256 --> 18:32.157
Aah!

18:32.225 --> 18:34.759
Hair follicles
on the bedspread,

18:34.827 --> 18:36.528
<i>dead skin cells</i>
<i>on the pillow,</i>

18:36.596 --> 18:38.296
chocolate stains on the desk

18:38.364 --> 18:40.031
and strawberry juice
on the carpet--

18:40.099 --> 18:43.067
not to mention bodily fluids,

18:43.135 --> 18:45.136
seminal stains and phlegm...
Walter, its okay.

18:45.204 --> 18:46.905
And urine on the carpet!

18:46.973 --> 18:49.774
<i>Don't you realize the harm</i>
<i>these pathogens can provoke?</i>

18:49.842 --> 18:51.176
I tried to ignore that.
Walter...

18:51.244 --> 18:53.479
I tried to ignore that!
Walter!

18:56.316 --> 18:58.685
There is nothing here
that can hurt you.

18:58.752 --> 19:01.287
This is all in your mind.

19:28.614 --> 19:30.882
I'm sorry.
Does that hurt?

19:30.950 --> 19:33.952
Not as deeply as my pride.

19:34.020 --> 19:37.389
Mysophobia...

19:37.456 --> 19:39.391
I haven't had an attack
in years.

19:39.458 --> 19:43.061
It's curious,
don't you think?

19:43.129 --> 19:47.400
The things that we see,
that we investigate,

19:47.468 --> 19:49.002
and you don't bat an eye,

19:49.069 --> 19:52.973
and some harmless germs
make you shake in your boots.

19:54.843 --> 19:58.078
I suppose it is.

19:58.146 --> 20:01.850
Elizabeth, my wife,

20:01.917 --> 20:04.052
used to say I was
a man of contradictions.

20:05.921 --> 20:08.056
She liked that about me.

20:10.725 --> 20:12.860
I liked everything
about her.

20:15.062 --> 20:18.898
She committed suicide.
Did you know that?

20:18.966 --> 20:22.001
After our Peter died.

20:24.671 --> 20:28.074
I'm glad she never
knew me like this...

20:28.142 --> 20:31.511
Afraid of things
I can't even see.

20:45.929 --> 20:47.429
Walter, I don't think

20:47.497 --> 20:51.400
I'm gonna get
much sleep tonight either.

20:51.468 --> 20:53.903
What do you say
to a root beer float?

20:58.375 --> 21:00.343
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:00.410 --> 21:03.312
Let me show you how.

21:03.380 --> 21:06.716
You take the straw
out of the glass, thusly.

21:06.784 --> 21:09.986
Then stab the ice cream...

21:10.054 --> 21:12.655
Push the straw
down to the root beer

21:12.723 --> 21:14.090
at the bottom,

21:14.158 --> 21:17.093
and then you suck up

21:17.161 --> 21:20.096
the ice cream
and the soda simultaneously

21:20.164 --> 21:21.430
to deliver the perfect blend

21:21.498 --> 21:24.300
of sugary goodness,
like so.

21:24.368 --> 21:26.669
Mmm, mmm.

21:26.737 --> 21:28.337
Ahh.

21:28.405 --> 21:30.440
Better?

21:30.508 --> 21:31.975
Better.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.580
Mmm.

21:39.784 --> 21:43.420
"Does he pose
a significant threat

21:43.487 --> 21:46.390
to himself or others?"

21:46.457 --> 21:48.926
Hmm?

21:48.993 --> 21:53.431
The letter in your jacket
from St. Claire's.

21:53.499 --> 21:55.100
I wasn't snooping.

21:55.168 --> 21:58.137
I-I saw the emblem.

22:00.174 --> 22:02.476
Well, perhaps
I was snooping a bit.

22:04.278 --> 22:07.948
I'm sorry. You weren't
supposed to see that.

22:08.015 --> 22:09.950
It's all right.

22:10.017 --> 22:12.386
I've known for three years
that this day

22:12.453 --> 22:13.854
would come sooner or later,

22:13.921 --> 22:17.424
that I was a burden
to Fringe Division and to you.

22:17.491 --> 22:18.525
Walter--

22:18.592 --> 22:20.794
No need to
sugarcoat it.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.729
I've never had
any illusions

22:22.797 --> 22:24.865
about the nature
of this relationship--

22:24.933 --> 22:26.533
of our relationship.

22:31.306 --> 22:34.541
I merely work for you.

22:34.609 --> 22:37.010
We're not family.

22:37.078 --> 22:38.979
If I should cease
to be useful,

22:39.047 --> 22:43.784
if my behaviors are outweighing
my value, well...

22:46.888 --> 22:50.891
That's why you left the lab,
isn't it, Walter...

22:52.326 --> 22:54.294
to prove that you're capable?

22:57.098 --> 22:59.666
I suppose tonight hasn't been
my strongest showing.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.183
I need you
to understand that...

23:17.251 --> 23:20.153
Whatever decision I make,

23:20.221 --> 23:24.724
I'm only trying to do
what's best.

23:26.594 --> 23:30.330
What's best for whom,
Agent Dunham?

23:40.109 --> 23:42.510
Oh, dear.

24:08.469 --> 24:10.069
<i>Olivia!</i>

24:28.223 --> 24:30.691
Thank you.

24:34.529 --> 24:35.729
Lieutenant Daniels?

24:35.797 --> 24:37.865
Special Agent Olivia Dunham.

24:37.932 --> 24:40.000
You're the fed who's been
pulling rank on my officers.

24:40.068 --> 24:41.969
I got eyewitnesses
reporting something

24:42.036 --> 24:43.837
that nobody seems
to be able to explain.

24:43.905 --> 24:46.039
I got a federal agent firing
shots in public--that's you.

24:46.107 --> 24:49.109
I got a car that ran into a wall
of blinding light.

24:49.176 --> 24:50.576
You want to tell me what
the hell's going on here, Agent?

24:50.644 --> 24:51.977
I don't know either.

24:52.045 --> 24:54.780
But like I told your officers,
I can handle it from here.

24:54.848 --> 24:56.615
So we're gonna need
the case files,

24:56.683 --> 24:58.116
witness statements,

24:58.184 --> 25:00.820
and also the security footage
from above the cash register.

25:00.887 --> 25:02.588
Before we discuss
the handling of evidence,

25:02.656 --> 25:03.956
you're gonna
have to explain to me

25:04.023 --> 25:05.457
exactly what
your jurisdiction is here.

25:05.525 --> 25:07.359
I think that this is
all you'll need.

25:07.427 --> 25:09.495
The name at the top
is my division chief,

25:09.563 --> 25:11.964
Phillip Broyles,
and below that, his boss.

25:12.032 --> 25:15.234
I'm sure that
you'll recognize that name.

25:15.302 --> 25:18.204
Blanket authority.

25:20.842 --> 25:22.743
There you go.

25:28.083 --> 25:29.516
I tried to give him
some soup,

25:29.584 --> 25:31.652
but he said
he wasn't interested.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.087
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:39.628 --> 25:41.695
<i>We should go now.</i>

25:41.763 --> 25:45.332
I want to be at Cameron James'
apartment before he gets home.

25:48.469 --> 25:51.504
This is because of what
I did to all of you.

25:54.108 --> 25:56.142
This is because of me.

26:03.185 --> 26:06.088
<i>It's an indisputable fact.</i>

26:06.156 --> 26:08.224
If I hadn't experimented
with Cortexiphan,

26:08.291 --> 26:09.992
then none of this
would be happening.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.295
37 innocent children,

26:12.363 --> 26:13.796
and I just
turned you into numbers,

26:13.864 --> 26:15.131
numbers in my head.

26:15.199 --> 26:18.034
I didn't follow up
on a single child--not even you.

26:18.101 --> 26:21.103
Hey, Walter, you said before
that the doses were so low,

26:21.171 --> 26:23.406
none of the children's abilities
lasted any longer

26:23.473 --> 26:25.741
than 24 hours after treatment.
- That's true.

26:25.809 --> 26:27.343
We couldn't have
accounted for this.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.546
But if--if Cameron
is manifesting

26:30.614 --> 26:33.949
astral projection,
then it must be inadvertent,

26:34.017 --> 26:36.084
which means that
he may not even be aware

26:36.152 --> 26:37.986
of the damage he's creating.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.488
Oh, no.
This is purposeful.

26:40.556 --> 26:41.689
I can feel it.

26:41.757 --> 26:43.458
Okay. Walter, here.

26:43.525 --> 26:44.492
Alone?

26:44.560 --> 26:46.094
Walter.

26:46.161 --> 26:48.329
May I borrow your
cell phone?

26:48.397 --> 26:51.099
I need to call
Agent Farnsworth...

26:51.167 --> 26:53.168
to check on my project.

26:55.838 --> 26:56.838
Thank you.

27:19.997 --> 27:21.164
Mark Little?

27:21.231 --> 27:22.632
Yeah.

27:22.699 --> 27:24.701
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

27:26.270 --> 27:29.339
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.

27:29.407 --> 27:31.876
Um, sure.
Anything you need.

27:31.944 --> 27:34.412
What's going on?

27:34.480 --> 27:37.148
Well, I'm actually looking
for a man named Cameron James.

27:37.216 --> 27:39.151
I was--hey!

27:39.219 --> 27:40.652
Cameron!

27:46.493 --> 27:47.726
Stop, Cameron!

27:51.365 --> 27:52.865
Oh!

27:54.835 --> 27:56.703
Cameron?

27:56.770 --> 27:59.005
Aah!

28:06.346 --> 28:07.646
- Why?
- Who are you?

28:07.714 --> 28:09.114
Why are you coming
after me?

28:09.181 --> 28:10.715
- What do you want from me?
- What's he doing here?

28:10.782 --> 28:13.117
- What do you want?
- What do you want from me?

28:13.184 --> 28:14.985
- <i>Leave me alone!</i>
- Olivia, please don't kill him.

28:16.854 --> 28:18.121
Olive?

28:18.189 --> 28:20.391
Don't you lie to me.
Why are you doing this to me?

28:20.458 --> 28:22.059
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:22.126 --> 28:25.996
I haven't thought
about you in years.

28:26.063 --> 28:28.231
Olive.

28:28.299 --> 28:30.734
Man, look at you.

28:30.801 --> 28:32.602
You're okay.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.137
No, no, no.

28:34.204 --> 28:36.773
The elevator, the lights.

28:36.841 --> 28:39.243
You're able
to astral project.

28:39.310 --> 28:42.246
Listen, Dr. Freak,

28:42.314 --> 28:44.115
I haven't been able
to astral project

28:44.183 --> 28:45.851
since you stopped shoving
needles in my arm

28:45.919 --> 28:47.987
when I was seven years old!

28:48.055 --> 28:50.423
Now, all I have
are the bad side effects!

28:56.096 --> 28:59.464
Anytime I have any kind
of anxiety, I send metal flying.

28:59.532 --> 29:00.766
So I have to stay calm.

29:03.169 --> 29:04.770
That's the funny thing
about life.

29:04.838 --> 29:07.005
It's not always calm,
you know?

29:07.073 --> 29:09.707
You want to hear
about my last date?

29:11.944 --> 29:15.079
I take a girl
for something to eat.

29:15.147 --> 29:17.649
I say something stupid.

29:17.717 --> 29:21.420
I see she saw
I said something stupid.

29:21.487 --> 29:23.255
Suddenly,
all the metal fillings

29:23.322 --> 29:26.391
are being pulled
out of her mouth.

29:26.459 --> 29:28.627
So thanks for that.

29:34.367 --> 29:37.035
Why did you change
your name?

29:37.103 --> 29:40.071
<i>What are you hiding from?</i>

29:41.773 --> 29:44.842
If I was hiding,
I would've moved.

29:44.910 --> 29:48.512
Cameron James
was my father's name.

29:48.580 --> 29:53.083
He was the one who signed me up
for those experiments,

29:53.151 --> 29:56.520
made me use his name
so he could access

29:56.588 --> 29:59.723
that pathetic trust fund
they gave us.

29:59.791 --> 30:02.226
He took money from you so you
could pump me full of drugs,

30:02.294 --> 30:06.029
then turned around
and spent it on drugs himself.

30:06.097 --> 30:09.066
Hell of a guy.

30:09.133 --> 30:13.036
I don't know what kind
of father does that.

30:13.104 --> 30:15.505
Not one I want to share
a name with.

30:20.044 --> 30:23.846
You realize
just what you did to me?

30:23.914 --> 30:26.048
<i>If you had given me</i>
<i>some special power,</i>

30:26.116 --> 30:27.817
that'd be one thing.

30:27.884 --> 30:31.386
Maybe I'd be special.

30:31.454 --> 30:34.690
Or at least I'd be useful.

30:34.757 --> 30:36.392
<i>Or if you'd just</i>
<i>left me alone,</i>

30:36.459 --> 30:38.361
I could have been normal,

30:38.428 --> 30:43.266
have a normal life
with normal friends.

30:43.334 --> 30:46.770
Instead, I'm neither.

30:46.838 --> 30:49.374
I'm just a freak.

30:51.310 --> 30:53.778
Can you understand
what that's like?

30:59.452 --> 31:01.952
I'm afraid I can.

31:02.020 --> 31:05.122
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

31:05.190 --> 31:09.092
I never meant to harm you.

31:18.901 --> 31:22.604
I have nothing to do with this!

31:27.509 --> 31:30.844
No!

31:38.486 --> 31:39.853
You stopped it.

31:43.490 --> 31:46.326
Walter, if he isn't doing this,
what is?

31:52.606 --> 31:53.906
<i>Walter...</i>

31:53.974 --> 31:55.975
You have to think
of something.

31:58.246 --> 31:59.613
I can't.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.548
There's nothing.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.949
Well, if it isn't Cameron,
then what is it?

32:04.017 --> 32:05.384
And why is it coming
after me?

32:05.452 --> 32:07.887
I don't know.

32:07.954 --> 32:10.923
You don't know?

32:10.990 --> 32:15.194
Or are you just afraid
to tell us?

32:15.261 --> 32:17.463
You think
I wouldn't tell you?

32:26.641 --> 32:30.677
You're not at all
like I remember you.

32:30.745 --> 32:32.512
What happened to you?

32:47.061 --> 32:49.429
Walter...

32:49.497 --> 32:52.799
You must be able to think
of something.

33:05.513 --> 33:09.617
It is possible
that the electromagnetism

33:09.684 --> 33:12.220
isn't the root cause

33:12.287 --> 33:15.956
but a side effect
of field distortions in time.

33:16.024 --> 33:17.091
<i>In time?</i>

33:17.158 --> 33:18.525
<i>Yes.</i>

33:18.593 --> 33:20.126
What we consider to be
linear time.

33:20.194 --> 33:22.295
Now, that would explain
the video in the lab.

33:22.363 --> 33:26.332
I witnessed
effect before cause.

33:26.400 --> 33:30.503
If Cameron's reflexive
magnetic discharge

33:30.570 --> 33:33.840
dispersed the energy event,

33:33.907 --> 33:35.708
<i>then this thing,</i>
<i>whatever it is,</i>

33:35.776 --> 33:38.378
does not create
magnetic fields.

33:38.446 --> 33:44.452
It--it--it distorts those
that already exist around us,

33:44.520 --> 33:47.122
focusing them,
maybe tearing them open...

33:47.190 --> 33:48.457
Okay.

33:48.525 --> 33:51.560
<i>And I'm afraid</i>
<i>it's going to keep returning</i>

33:51.628 --> 33:54.130
until it's demolished,
growing so large

33:54.198 --> 33:57.833
that it will consume
everything in its path.

33:57.901 --> 34:00.836
Okay.
So how do we stop it?

34:00.904 --> 34:05.007
Well, we gather together
a large enough field of energy

34:05.075 --> 34:07.510
to neutralize
the electromagnetism.

34:07.577 --> 34:09.378
In theory,
it should shatter it.

34:09.446 --> 34:11.313
Okay.
So how do we do that?

34:11.380 --> 34:12.848
We can't.

34:12.916 --> 34:15.384
Only he can.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.024
You have the ability
to gather and direct

34:21.092 --> 34:22.492
the kind of power we need.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.927
- How?
- You just did it in the hallway.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.429
Once when you were a boy,

34:25.496 --> 34:28.098
you blew up a toaster oven
with your mind

34:28.166 --> 34:30.734
simply because of an irrational
hatred of raisin toast.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.536
- Have you ever had raisin toast?
- I know.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.039
I was not correct that
your abilities faded over time,

34:36.107 --> 34:38.308
but I am certain
that their utility

34:38.376 --> 34:41.411
is based on your ability
to focus your emotions.

34:41.478 --> 34:44.047
It's like the toaster oven,
but on a grand scale.

34:44.114 --> 34:45.815
Thanks, Astrid.

34:45.882 --> 34:48.585
Okay. There's a power grid
terminal on the West Side.

35:06.406 --> 35:08.006
What do we do now?

35:08.074 --> 35:09.341
For whatever reason,

35:09.409 --> 35:11.110
the force seems to be drawn
to Agent Dunham.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.344
So now we wait.

35:12.412 --> 35:14.946
When it attacks her again,
you will combine your energy

35:15.014 --> 35:17.115
with the energy
of the power grid to destroy it.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.794
Have you heard
about any of the others?

35:32.330 --> 35:34.632
No.

35:34.699 --> 35:35.866
Have you?

35:35.934 --> 35:37.534
<i>You're the first.</i>

35:37.602 --> 35:40.337
I used to wonder
about them a lot.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.342
Less so now, I guess.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.818
You haven't had any side effects
from the experiments?

35:56.488 --> 35:58.489
You're really lucky.

36:00.425 --> 36:02.960
Or it's something else.

36:03.028 --> 36:04.828
What are you saying?

36:06.498 --> 36:09.900
When I had
my first experience,

36:09.968 --> 36:14.037
I thought something
was coming after me, too...

36:14.105 --> 36:18.108
Until I realized
I was doing it to myself.

36:22.146 --> 36:25.482
You think
I'm doing this...

36:25.549 --> 36:29.452
that I'm bringing this
on myself?

36:29.520 --> 36:32.455
I don't know.

36:32.523 --> 36:36.293
The question is, would he tell
you if he thought you were?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.904
You weren't there anymore.

36:45.972 --> 36:49.909
<i>But I remember he wasn't happy</i>
<i>when the experiments stopped.</i>

37:04.457 --> 37:05.924
It's happening.

37:05.992 --> 37:08.960
It's happening!

37:09.028 --> 37:12.331
<i>It's happening!</i>

37:12.399 --> 37:14.266
Now, Cameron!

37:14.334 --> 37:16.335
<i>This isn't me.</i>

37:16.403 --> 37:18.871
I am not doing this.

37:18.939 --> 37:20.973
Do it, Cameron!

37:21.041 --> 37:23.442
Direct it at the wall!

37:25.979 --> 37:27.079
Good!
That's it!

37:27.147 --> 37:29.115
Disperse the energy!

37:30.951 --> 37:33.418
<i>Now, Cameron,</i>
<i>before it's too late!</i>

37:46.800 --> 37:48.367
You.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.902
Yes!

37:49.969 --> 37:51.803
That's it!
It's working!

37:51.871 --> 37:53.138
<i>Stronger!</i>

37:56.375 --> 37:57.575
Come on, destroy it!

37:57.643 --> 37:59.477
Cameron, stop.

37:59.544 --> 38:01.412
Cameron.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.314
Stop, Cameron!

38:04.716 --> 38:06.717
Olivia, what are you doing?

38:08.453 --> 38:10.387
Cameron!

38:53.021 --> 38:56.490
I'm telling you, Walter,
I was not seeing things.

38:56.557 --> 38:59.158
- You're telling me it was him, the man?
- Yes.

38:59.226 --> 39:02.595
The man I was seeing
in the lab?

39:02.662 --> 39:05.998
The man you've been seeing
in your dreams?

39:06.066 --> 39:09.535
Then why did you try to stop
Cameron from destroying it?

39:09.602 --> 39:11.170
I don't know.
I can't explain it.

39:11.238 --> 39:13.606
I just had a feeling
that--that...

39:13.674 --> 39:16.243
that he didn't want
to hurt me,

39:16.311 --> 39:17.912
that he wanted my help.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.690
You know, Cameron,
if there's anything

39:29.758 --> 39:32.260
that I can do for you...

39:35.897 --> 39:38.265
Make him forget about me.

39:55.148 --> 39:56.648
Walter...

39:56.716 --> 39:59.518
Do you think
we destroyed it?

39:59.585 --> 40:01.686
Do you think it's gone?

40:05.491 --> 40:07.258
I can't be sure, Olivia.

40:07.326 --> 40:11.062
What you did may have
compromised Cameron's ability.

40:11.130 --> 40:13.064
He may have just
displaced it.

40:15.400 --> 40:19.169
You acted against
all reasonable agreements

40:19.236 --> 40:21.671
and expectations.

40:21.739 --> 40:24.040
You behaved irrationally

40:24.108 --> 40:27.677
with regard to only
your intuition and instincts.

40:27.745 --> 40:29.912
I guess I did.

40:31.215 --> 40:34.251
When I do that,
people say I'm crazy.

40:34.318 --> 40:37.688
I suppose I've learned
that crazy

40:37.755 --> 40:40.357
is a lot more complicated
than people think.

40:51.771 --> 40:52.771
Dunham.

40:52.838 --> 40:55.373
I just received
a disturbing call.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.108
A father and son
just pulled a man

40:58.176 --> 40:59.643
from the middle
of Reiden Lake.

40:59.711 --> 41:01.412
Where's Reiden Lake?

41:01.479 --> 41:03.280
<i>Upstate New York.</i>

41:03.348 --> 41:05.883
<i>Details are sketchy,</i>
<i>but apparently whoever he is</i>

41:05.950 --> 41:08.219
knows a lot
of classified information--

41:08.286 --> 41:11.255
things no one outside this
division could possibly know.

41:11.322 --> 41:14.225
What's more...

41:14.293 --> 41:16.827
He claims to know
every one of us.

41:16.895 --> 41:20.798
I had a house at Reiden Lake.

41:25.070 --> 41:26.737
Sorry I kept you
waiting so long.

41:26.805 --> 41:28.739
Phillip Broyles--
we spoke on the phone.

41:28.806 --> 41:30.741
He's stabilized.
Vitals are good.

41:30.809 --> 41:33.144
- Has he said anything else?
- No.

41:33.212 --> 41:35.313
But he keeps talking
about an Olivia Dunham.

41:36.682 --> 41:38.550
That's me.

41:38.618 --> 41:40.586
Can you take me to him?

41:40.654 --> 41:42.188
Follow me.

41:45.926 --> 41:48.762
Excuse me, Doctor.

42:33.104 --> 42:35.138
Olivia.

42:35.206 --> 42:38.442
<i>Thank God you're here.</i>

42:38.510 --> 42:41.545
Who are you?
