WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:02.948
This is top priority.

00:03.303 --> 00:05.180
Looks like a can of sardines to me.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.845
It's one can of sardines we don't want opened.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.992
(Dominic) We've got an airborne target.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.754
I'm gonna try and force them down.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.887
Do as you're told, and nobody will get hurt.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.089
[screaming]

00:22.990 --> 00:24.060
Turbos.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.764
You can't use turbos.
The disengage is locked down.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.829
You'll tear off the blades.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

02:04.591 --> 02:06.366
(Jarrett) Ladies and gentlemen,

02:06.426 --> 02:08.872
you are indeed among the chosen few.

02:08.929 --> 02:12.604
I am pleased to introduce to you, Loki.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.849
Loki is a breakthrough, ladies and gentlemen.

02:17.904 --> 02:22.375
It is the first, shall we say,
bio-feed back system for an aircraft.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.822
Three dozen sensors send
readings into Loki's brain

02:26.880 --> 02:28.587
for instant analysis.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.959
It knows just how hard it can be flown,

02:31.018 --> 02:32.861
how much it can take.

02:32.919 --> 02:36.162
In short, it makes every aircraft

02:36.223 --> 02:38.225
the very best it can be.

02:50.037 --> 02:53.541
It is the central nervous
system of the aircraft.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.110
And like a man defending his own life,

02:56.610 --> 03:01.081
Loki is capable of maneuvers far
beyond the aircraft's design.

03:07.154 --> 03:11.125
Loki actually learns what kind of aircraft
it's flying in a few short moments.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.761
And then, look out.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.671
We installed a prototype of Loki in
this Korean War vintage fighter.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.908
Then we sent it out to
challenge 2 F-4 fighters.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.806
(Board member) Those performance parameters…

03:58.872 --> 04:01.045
can a pilot withstand that kind of punishment?

04:01.108 --> 04:02.280
(Jarrett) We don't know.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.084
But pity the poor attacker who
tries to keep up with Loki.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.502
[beeping]

04:34.107 --> 04:35.450
[explosion]

04:35.509 --> 04:37.182
[screaming]

04:40.313 --> 04:43.487
(Steele) Come on, come on. Hurry up. Let's go.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.121
Everybody stay calm and nobody will get hurt.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.827
(Elena) He's got the Loki box, get it!

04:52.425 --> 04:54.200
[coughing]

05:18.485 --> 05:20.055
[chattering]

05:29.062 --> 05:31.633
Excuse me, sir, this is a…
You're not supposed to…

05:35.335 --> 05:38.145
What are you doin’? Get in. Let's go.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.212
[chattering]

05:41.074 --> 05:42.553
[screaming]

05:50.750 --> 05:51.751
(woman) Please get some help!

05:51.852 --> 05:54.389
What's going on? Look what you did to my car!

05:54.454 --> 05:55.728
(Elena) Hey, shut up!

05:55.789 --> 05:59.965
Hey! No problem. It's okay.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.696
- It's okay.
- (woman) What do you mean? Get the police!

06:02.762 --> 06:05.072
[screaming] Get in his car. Take his car.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.702
You got it. It's cool.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.908
Looks like a can of sardines to me.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.010
Well, it's one can of sardines
we don't want opened.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.350
Terrorists armed with Loki could
strike anywhere in the world

06:50.410 --> 06:53.391
using virtually any kind of aircraft.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.582
This was top-secret.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.756
Well then, why was this guy
Jarrett doing a show-and-tell

06:59.819 --> 07:02.390
for half the fat cat investors
on his Board of Directors?

07:02.455 --> 07:05.766
Because Jarrett's an idiot and a showboat.

07:06.893 --> 07:09.203
And you want us to use Airwolf

07:09.262 --> 07:11.435
to find what this idiot lost.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.741
Wait a minute. I haven't finished
repairing that communications board yet.

07:14.801 --> 07:19.045
Well, then you'll just have to rig
something. As I said, this is top priority.

07:19.706 --> 07:24.655
We have a report that the get-away car
entered the Halinan National Forest

07:26.413 --> 07:29.223
at this point.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.353
Ranger Station 47.

07:31.418 --> 07:35.491
The Halinan National Forest
is 10,000 square miles.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.764
Well, I'm sure glad you
narrowed it down for us.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.930
(Michael) I know it's a
big hunk of real estate.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.464
That's why we need Airwolf
with all sensors tracking.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.135
Oh, and one word of caution, Hawke.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.907
If you do find Loki, and they've
already got it installed

07:48.969 --> 07:50.380
in some kind of aircraft,

07:50.437 --> 07:51.939
don't try to take them on.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.575
Loki isn't human.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.780
It doesn't recognize human limitations.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.418
Yeah, we'll keep that in mind.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.227
So long, Michael.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.327
Always great to see you.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.795
(Doc) Got that water boiling there, Charlie?

08:15.061 --> 08:17.132
Yeah, 3 pans.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.673
Everything's gonna work out
just great, Mrs. Tarwater.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.840
We'll work together on this, okay?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.886
[Mrs. Tarwater groaning]

08:30.143 --> 08:32.589
You got that alcohol handy, Charlie?

08:32.879 --> 08:35.086
[Mrs. Tarwater breathing heavily]

08:35.148 --> 08:36.388
Right here.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.495
Doc, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?

08:43.623 --> 08:45.000
Drink this.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.495
It's gonna be all right.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.005
Isn't it, Doc?

08:49.129 --> 08:52.133
Piece of cake. Just quit calling me Doc.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.675
Well, now, you've done
this before, haven't you?

08:57.003 --> 08:59.813
Sure, Doc's done this lots of times.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.443
Haven't you, Doc?

09:01.508 --> 09:03.181
Sure, of course.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.089
What else can you do around
here on a Saturday night?

09:08.114 --> 09:09.718
Thank God.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.360
You know, when that bridge
washed out, I got real scared.

09:19.859 --> 09:22.305
(Charlie) We came up in here to God's country.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.434
Well, we live off the land.
We do it all, by ourselves.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.740
We just weren't prepared for this.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.873
The baby's 2 weeks early.

09:30.937 --> 09:33.543
(Charlie) I feel blessed
to have you with us, Doc.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.950
Well, no, we're truly blessed.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.291
Hey, don't you drink all of that.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.457
[Mrs. Tarwater groaning]

09:46.019 --> 09:47.225
Here you go.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.665
Okay, Charlie, how about some water?

09:49.989 --> 09:51.127
Water.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.737
Okay now, just breathe.
Just continue to breathe.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.364
The little one will be here any minute.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.199
That's it, the engine's about had it.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.132
We have to rendezvous in 6 hours.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.434
We're just gonna be late.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.270
And whose fault is that, Lucas?

11:04.330 --> 11:08.244
$10 million is the payment for this
one, and you nearly blew it for us.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.303
We still got the thing, the Loki.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.644
(Steele) It's just a tool.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.275
Look, he's getting worse, Steele.
We've gotta get him to a Doctor.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.480
Yeah, he's vital to this operation.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.387
How far is the next town?

11:20.446 --> 11:22.892
Town? Are you kidding?

11:24.083 --> 11:26.893
Look, there might be a settlement up ahead.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.963
Lucas, dump it.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.531
When you're rid of it, get back here fast.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.791
[baby crying]

11:55.848 --> 11:58.829
(Doc) Okay, come on.
Come on, let's get you warm.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.229
Just look at that cute little face!

12:01.287 --> 12:03.164
Can you just give me a little air here?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.225
Come on, now. Come on.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.738
Here we go, here we go.
Here we go. See your Ma.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.670
See your Ma.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.040
That's a familiar sound.
You're gonna hear it again.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.739
Look at this.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.473
Thanks, Doc.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.485
I just wish next time you might
give me a little more warning.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.219
I'll get you down the mountainside,

12:28.281 --> 12:30.352
I'll get you into the hands
of a real Doctor, okay?

12:30.416 --> 12:32.327
Well, hey, wait a minute, Doc.
Where are you going?

12:32.385 --> 12:34.262
I saved one shot for you.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.263
I'll take a rain check on that
one, Charlie. It's getting late.

12:39.525 --> 12:43.029
Well, I got another appointment
I got to make. I'm sorry.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.470
Bye-bye.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.774
Oh, Charlie, can you do me one favor?

12:50.570 --> 12:53.210
Just quit calling me Doc.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.680
Bye-bye.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.594
[giggling]

13:07.920 --> 13:10.196
You should've been there, Max.
You should've seen it.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.031
I'm telling you, it is a miracle.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.129
I mean, all of a sudden, there
he was, this beautiful baby boy,

13:15.194 --> 13:17.538
his butt parked in my hands

13:17.597 --> 13:20.237
and he's just screaming, hollering
to beat the band. I'm tell’n you,

13:20.300 --> 13:21.711
it was someth’n.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.304
I can picture you doing that.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.146
You know, it was the first
time I ever saw a baby born.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.550
Hope you didn't tell Mrs. Tarwater that.

13:29.709 --> 13:32.747
Sure. Come on, get up.
What's for breakfast?

13:33.713 --> 13:35.420
Oh, I don't know.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.424
How about some eggs,

13:37.717 --> 13:39.560
pigs in a blanket

13:39.686 --> 13:42.064
and a pot of Maxine's best?

13:42.121 --> 13:45.364
I don't know. You're the
proprietor. You surprise me.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.669
You always surprise me,

13:48.094 --> 13:49.198
Doc.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.304
Come here. Get out of here!

13:52.498 --> 13:56.002
(TV Announcer) Lord Killebrew, as the
most widely respected peace negotiator

13:56.069 --> 13:57.742
on the international scene,

13:57.804 --> 14:00.444
your new initiatives can bring
permanent change in the Middle East.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.349
- Good morning, Frank.
- Good morning, Doc.

14:02.408 --> 14:06.288
Well, it still may be possible to achieve
a lasting peace in the Middle East

14:06.346 --> 14:07.916
with this bold new stroke.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.427
If we waited for all conflicts
to end before seeking peace,

14:11.484 --> 14:13.157
we'd never get started at all.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.789
Peace is not something for those

14:14.854 --> 14:18.358
who stand idly and quietly aside.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.096
Well, I'll drink to that.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.935
(TV Announcer) Lord Killebrew's stay in
the United States will be a short one…

14:22.995 --> 14:24.975
So Sally, how are my moccasins coming along?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.908
You'll have them by Christmas, Doc.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.037
Isn't that what you said last Christmas?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.479
Well now,

14:30.536 --> 14:33.210
when are you gonna take a look at my bunions?

14:33.272 --> 14:36.742
Why is it this community can't get
themselves a real Doctor up here, huh?

14:36.809 --> 14:39.119
It's getting so a man can't
even do his job anymore.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.680
I'm a bush pilot,

14:40.747 --> 14:42.852
and I'm going broke in
the Florence Nightingale bit,

14:42.915 --> 14:45.657
every time some sourdough
falls off a log around here.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.755
Don't kid us, you love it.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.465
Hey, by the way, Doc.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.662
I've been having this problem with
my lumbago, and I just wondered…

14:52.725 --> 14:54.830
Why don't you just lower
your intake of red meat?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.635
That'll be a good start right there, Frank.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.300
Oh, yeah, sorry.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.469
I know you had a tough night, huh?

15:00.533 --> 15:01.910
[Frank laughing]

15:03.636 --> 15:06.515
What about those bears that were
hanging around the garbage dump?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.449
Frank had to bust ‘em.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.755
Way I heard it, it was
the bears that busted Frank.

15:12.311 --> 15:15.815
Badger, I think you got
a touch of cabin fever.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.590
Maybe you ought to get out
and see a little of the world.

15:20.686 --> 15:22.097
[laughing]

15:25.525 --> 15:28.529
Come on in, stranger. The drinks are on Doc.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.534
What can we do for you people?

15:30.596 --> 15:31.904
Could you help us out?

15:31.964 --> 15:34.376
We have someone who needs medical assistance.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.038
Which one's Doc?

15:36.102 --> 15:39.447
Well, I had some medical training
in the service, I'm not a Doctor.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.416
Our friend is hurt.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.714
(Doc) Okay, I'll take a look at him,

15:44.777 --> 15:48.657
and if it's serious, we'll fly him
down the mountain to Gem City.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.770
This is a bullet wound.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.972
Congratulations, Doc.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.340
You just got the job.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.317
(Dominic) That should bring our
communications back online.

16:20.379 --> 16:23.292
I don't know how long these
temporary solder points will hold.

16:23.349 --> 16:26.489
But for the time being, we got communications.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.966
Never enough time to do anything around here.

16:30.022 --> 16:31.729
[laughing]

16:39.632 --> 16:43.603
Hey, String, what kind
of a name is L-O-K-I, Loki?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.506
Loki was an ancient Nordic God.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.811
Sort of like old Thor's hit man.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.481
Always untrustworthy and up to no good.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.081
Kind of like, you might call
him the god of bad news.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.719
Now he tells me.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.596
Turbos.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.002
Coming up…

17:32.685 --> 17:34.824
I can't operate on this man.

17:35.521 --> 17:36.591
[glass shattering]

17:39.091 --> 17:40.866
I'm losing patience.

17:43.930 --> 17:44.931
No.

17:44.997 --> 17:48.103
Okay, all right. Okay,
just hold it. Let her go.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.684
Okay Maxine, go down to the chopper
and bring up my emergency kit.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.122
(Steele) Hold it.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.588
Lucas.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.487
Lucas.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.136
- You go.
- (man on radio) Ranger Station 28,

18:15.194 --> 18:17.333
any word on how those
construction crews are doing

18:17.396 --> 18:19.205
down at Blue River Junction?

18:23.536 --> 18:26.142
And while you're there,
do the same to his radio.

18:26.205 --> 18:30.119
But don't damage the flight
instruments. We're gonna need ‘em.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.525
(Dominic) Hey, look. Look
at that family of bears.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.806
(Michael) What's your status, Hawke?

18:54.867 --> 18:57.711
Have those million-dollar heat
sensors come up with anything yet?

18:57.770 --> 19:01.946
Sure, we got 24 mountain goats, 42 deer

19:02.575 --> 19:04.816
and 36 stray sheep.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.554
Correction, 37 sheep.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.684
Or is it goats?

19:10.449 --> 19:11.757
[laughing]

19:13.119 --> 19:15.360
You'll just have to keep at it.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.982
That's 2 mistakes.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.684
Yes, sir.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.484
It's time to move. Where is it?

20:14.547 --> 20:15.924
Downstairs.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.017
Do as you're told, and nobody will get hurt.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.679
You're not going to put us in there?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.781
There's no air in there, we'll suffocate.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.154
It's a meat locker.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.091
(Frank) Look, you don't have
to put anybody any place.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.925
Without a radio up here,
we're completely shut off.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.396
I won't go.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.399
Look, I'm not afraid of
these clowns. Let ‘em shoot.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.695
See if I give a damn!

20:57.757 --> 21:00.704
I'm only gonna say this once, now move it!

21:00.926 --> 21:03.202
[screaming]

21:03.262 --> 21:06.004
Freeze! Freeze!

21:06.098 --> 21:07.202
Frank.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.405
Okay, everybody in there, now!

21:09.468 --> 21:12.005
Move it! Now!

21:16.342 --> 21:17.878
[groaning]

21:21.180 --> 21:25.128
[muffled shouting]

21:26.452 --> 21:27.726
I heard a shot.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.996
Forget it! You're supposed to be guarding Doc!

21:31.056 --> 21:33.127
He's unconscious.

21:48.207 --> 21:51.245
It's no use, 10 men couldn't open that door.

21:53.412 --> 21:55.358
Come on here, Frank.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.694
Doc’ll get us out.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.794
Won't he, Max?

22:00.953 --> 22:02.591
Sure he will, Sally.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.729
Doc's never let you down yet, has he Frank?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.544
Where's everybody?

22:23.676 --> 22:26.179
In the meat locker. Now let's go.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.886
You can't put ‘em in there.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.761
You animals! They're gonna suffocate in there.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.324
They'll live.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.457
But not for long unless you
get that chopper in the air

22:36.522 --> 22:39.435
and put us down exactly where we tell you to.

22:43.495 --> 22:44.769
All right.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.041
But listen to me.

22:47.433 --> 22:50.414
Just one of my friends
doesn't make it outta here,

22:50.469 --> 22:51.971
I'm gonna find you.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.781
No matter where you are,

22:55.841 --> 22:57.946
I'll find you, all of you.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.564
(Dominic) Well, according to the
computer, that's Crystal Lake,

23:07.620 --> 23:09.395
home of the Golden Otter Lodge.

23:09.455 --> 23:10.763
(Stringfellow) When all this is over,

23:10.823 --> 23:13.030
we gotta come back and take in a few rainbows.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.969
Hey, yeah.

23:15.661 --> 23:16.833
Hey, that's funny, though.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.341
What's that?

23:18.397 --> 23:19.569
Well, there's no people.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.839
Not even a caretaker or a watch dog.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.882
Not even a single fly
fisherman out by the lake.

23:31.543 --> 23:35.423
Hey, infrared doesn't even
show a fire in the cook stove.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.293
Well, maybe everybody's off on a hike.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.233
(Dominic) Uh-oh, look at this.

23:50.996 --> 23:53.738
Whatever it is, it's big,

23:54.233 --> 23:55.576
it’s metal,

24:03.242 --> 24:04.812
and the plates match.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.448
Hey, that's the getaway vehicle, String.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.053
Oh-oh, wait a minute.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.491
Radar just overrode.

24:10.549 --> 24:13.758
We've got an airborne target, bearing 295.

24:13.819 --> 24:16.732
The computer identifies it as a bush chopper.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.793
Yeah, and he's skimming
right down along the treetops.

24:19.858 --> 24:21.929
Uh-huh, and he's in a big hurry.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.167
Let's go check it out.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.467
(Steele) What is that?

24:52.524 --> 24:55.471
It's company, UFO, long arm of the law.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.473
(Elena) They're signaling us.

24:57.529 --> 24:59.531
(Doc) Sure, they want us to
acknowledge their transmissions.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.707
What do we do?

25:03.769 --> 25:06.716
Signal to them we're having radio difficulties.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.950
They're just like some guys out hunting to me.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.221
Yeah, but did you get the count?

25:19.151 --> 25:21.859
(Stringfellow) Pilot, 3 men and a woman.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.801
It's just like the heist team.

25:27.993 --> 25:30.303
I'm gonna try and force ‘em down.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.568
Lose ‘em.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.008
I'm afraid that's not gonna be too easy.

25:36.001 --> 25:40.279
Hey, this guy's hotter than a
$2 pistol on a Saturday night.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.376
(Stringfellow) Dom, try and contact Archangel.

25:42.441 --> 25:45.581
(Dominic) Okay. But stay glued
to his tail like a fox hound.

25:45.644 --> 25:48.124
Yeah, that's what worries me.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.386
What?

25:49.615 --> 25:51.526
This is his briar patch.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.860
(Steele) If we don't make it,
your friends won't either.

25:55.921 --> 25:59.733
I can't outrun this monster, I'm
loaded down. He's got twice the power.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.071
(Steele) Well, you better do something.

26:26.552 --> 26:29.089
Watch it, he's going into that canyon.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.841
(Dominic) String!

27:25.644 --> 27:27.624
Hold her, String. Hold her.

27:27.746 --> 27:29.623
Dom, we're going down.

27:50.702 --> 27:52.045
[Dominic groans]

27:52.104 --> 27:55.551
The solder points didn't hold.
Our communications are cooked.

27:55.607 --> 27:59.214
We're gonna have to adjust that tail
rotor before we can get back in the air.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.552
Well, could be worse.

28:00.612 --> 28:03.559
We could be stuck halfway in that
tunnel with no rotors at all.

28:03.615 --> 28:06.095
Yeah, pretty fancy flying.

28:08.887 --> 28:11.163
(Steele) There it is, up ahead.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.694
You mean the old radar base?

28:13.792 --> 28:15.703
Don't you know this is Federal property?

28:15.761 --> 28:17.104
Take it down.

29:04.610 --> 29:05.953
This way.

29:21.226 --> 29:22.500
[dogs barking]

29:22.961 --> 29:26.340
(Frank) I can't breathe, Max.
The air's going bad in here.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.480
It's oxygen depletion.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.947
Pretty soon it won't be fit to breathe.

29:34.139 --> 29:35.743
I'm here, Frank.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.552
For a while I couldn't see.

29:42.047 --> 29:45.051
It was all dark like I was… it's like I was…

29:45.117 --> 29:47.358
Everything's gonna be okay.

29:48.086 --> 29:51.795
Why would they do this? What
have we ever done to them?

29:51.990 --> 29:53.469
I don't know.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.403
To hell with ‘em.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.201
What matters is for us to stay alive

29:57.262 --> 29:59.003
so that when Doc gets here,

29:59.064 --> 30:02.341
Sheriff Frank can give him hell
for taking his sweet time.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.777
That's right. Doc wouldn't know
what to do without us around

30:04.836 --> 30:07.817
to pull his leg once in a
while. Now, would he, Frank?

30:07.973 --> 30:09.577
Damn straight.

30:14.513 --> 30:15.753
Frank.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.601
(Steele) Along here.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.408
It's that way.

30:55.554 --> 30:56.862
Follow him.

30:57.222 --> 30:59.498
It's quite the little summer
camp you got up here, isn't it?

30:59.558 --> 31:01.731
What do we do now, play capture the flag?

31:01.793 --> 31:03.830
Something like that, yeah.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.574
Follow him.

31:30.288 --> 31:33.428
We're nearly 10 hours behind schedule,
Steele. What took you so long?

31:33.492 --> 31:35.369
Vehicular difficulties.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.630
Who is this?

31:36.695 --> 31:39.676
No one. Lucas, take him out.

31:40.098 --> 31:43.705
Bury him so even the dogs won't
be able to find his bones.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.815
(Lucas) Yes, sir.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.511
Hey, let's move it.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.389
Those people are gonna die back there,
Lucas. You know that, don't you?

31:59.451 --> 32:00.725
You're breaking my heart.

32:00.786 --> 32:03.062
Just let me go. Steele and Elena,
they'll never know the difference.

32:03.121 --> 32:05.123
By the time I get them out of
there, you'll be long gone.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.760
What do you say, Lucas? What do you say?

32:06.825 --> 32:08.133
Move!

32:40.125 --> 32:41.832
Come on, what do you say, Lucas?

32:41.893 --> 32:43.236
I say hold it.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.425
- Dom.
- (Dominic) Yeah?

34:15.487 --> 34:16.830
How many foot pounds?

34:19.424 --> 34:23.702
You know String, I was just think’n
about that pilot of that chopper.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.138
Dad gummit! I hate to see talent like that

34:26.197 --> 34:28.734
turned into crime and murder.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.310
Dom, pilots are people.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.906
And there's people on both sides of the law.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.781
Yeah, I reckon so.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.379
Hold it right there!

35:12.444 --> 35:14.219
Wait, those…

35:14.679 --> 35:16.886
Put your hands behind your neck.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.261
Hey String, that's him.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.300
You flew the chopper through
the tunnel, didn't ya?

35:24.356 --> 35:26.996
I'm not one of ‘em, they forced
me to take them up there.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.628
You got to help me.

35:29.561 --> 35:32.064
I said put your hands behind your neck!

35:32.130 --> 35:33.973
Look, take it easy, will ya?

35:34.032 --> 35:35.909
They got 4 people that are suffocat’n

35:35.967 --> 35:38.709
in an air-tight locker
back up there at the lodge.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.613
We gotta get to ‘em.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.178
Look, these are my friends!

35:45.477 --> 35:47.115
This is my family.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.751
Please.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.520
Please?

35:58.757 --> 36:00.498
(Roper) We're almost ready.

36:00.625 --> 36:03.765
(Elena) It is hard to believe that one
little box is capable of so much.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.774
With this in our private arsenal,

36:05.830 --> 36:08.606
there will be no target in the
world we could not eliminate.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.305
At the right price.

36:10.368 --> 36:12.507
Always at the right price.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.813
And today's job is just paying our expenses.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.755
Be my guest.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.632
Programmed.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.562
Ready?

36:34.392 --> 36:35.598
Ready.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.770
You're not sending the pilot up in this?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.538
Nothing will be left to chance.

36:41.599 --> 36:44.443
Does he know if Loki gets into
defensive mode, he could…

36:44.502 --> 36:47.244
For his share, he must take that chance.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.936
(Maxine) [muffled] Somebody there?

37:14.666 --> 37:16.873
Somebody there?

37:17.802 --> 37:19.042
“Hey Max?”

37:19.104 --> 37:20.105
(Maxine) Doc?

37:20.171 --> 37:21.673
- You all right in there?
- Doc?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.720
Just hang on. We'll get you out.

37:24.275 --> 37:25.879
(Dominic) Wait a minute now.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.481
(Doc) Just hang on. How's everybody in there?

37:29.180 --> 37:30.488
Here.

37:31.549 --> 37:33.028
There you go. There you go.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.964
Just hang on in there. We'll pull the
lock off. We'll get you right out.

37:37.122 --> 37:39.159
Easy does it now. Easy.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.262
[groans]

37:48.767 --> 37:50.110
You all right?

37:50.335 --> 37:52.281
Doc, Doc.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.985
(Doc) You're okay? You're all okay, huh?

37:56.040 --> 37:58.577
How you doing? Where's Frank?

38:04.215 --> 38:05.421
Oh, no.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.523
So how is he? Is he gonna make it?

38:36.581 --> 38:40.324
Well, Doc set his shoulder and he's
got a real nasty bruise on his head.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.195
- I'm just fine.
- Oh, sure, sure.

38:59.437 --> 39:02.281
The man never saw a real
criminal his whole life.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.452
Until now.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.256
There's gonna be justice for this.

39:14.853 --> 39:18.130
I know how you feel Doc,
but what can we do?

39:18.823 --> 39:20.097
Plenty.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.882
Whoa, easy Hawke.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.580
(Dominic) Forget it, String.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.632
String, you're in no condition.

39:54.659 --> 39:57.265
Dom, I can fly just fine.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.170
Let's do it.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.854
Hey Doc, you just show us where they are, huh?

40:13.912 --> 40:15.084
My pleasure.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.254
Dom, what's goin’ on with the radio?

40:19.851 --> 40:21.660
(Dominic) I think we got something.

40:21.719 --> 40:24.461
Hawke, we've been trying
to raise you for hours.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.297
Michael, we found Loki.

40:26.357 --> 40:29.804
They've got a chopper, I think they're
trying to use it to get out of the country.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.568
I don't think it's that simple.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.905
The description of the thieves fits a new gang

40:33.965 --> 40:36.241
of paid assassins operating out of Europe.

40:36.301 --> 40:37.405
(Dominic) Hit men?

40:37.468 --> 40:39.846
(Michael) Services to the highest bidder.

40:39.904 --> 40:42.817
And I'd bet my last dollar they're
planning to fill an open contract

40:42.874 --> 40:44.683
up there in the north woods.

40:44.742 --> 40:46.779
Contract, huh? With who?

40:46.844 --> 40:50.792
Lord Killebrew, off on
an unscheduled fishing trip.

40:50.848 --> 40:54.125
Dead, he's worth $10 million
to the right parties.

40:54.185 --> 40:55.994
Well, we better get out there.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.465
- Turbos!
- No, wait!

40:57.522 --> 41:00.628
You can't use turbos. The
disengage is locked down.

41:00.758 --> 41:02.897
You'll tear off the blades.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.874
(Pilot) Union Jack 1, this is Escort 1.

41:10.935 --> 41:14.007
We have a clear landing zone,
ETA is 3 minutes and counting.

41:14.072 --> 41:17.019
Lord Killebrew, looks like
a great day for lake trout.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.316
(Killebrew) And it's a lovely sight indeed.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.675
5 minutes and they're gone.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.906
Our mission's not over
till we confirm the kill.

41:43.968 --> 41:48.178
Then we fly to the set-down point,
retrieve Loki, and move on.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.952
To bigger and better paydays.

42:04.822 --> 42:08.634
(Pilot 1) Union Jack 1, our radar
is picking up an incoming aircraft.

42:09.927 --> 42:13.465
(Pilot 2) This is Union Jack 1.
What's he doing up here?

42:27.712 --> 42:30.249
(Pilot 1) Union Jack 1, veer off, veer off.

42:30.314 --> 42:32.624
He's disregarding my signal.

42:58.509 --> 43:01.046
(Stringfellow) He took out the escort ship.

43:01.112 --> 43:02.989
I wish we had our turbos.

43:14.325 --> 43:16.862
When our Libyan friend sees this film,

43:16.928 --> 43:20.705
he's gonna be very pleased to know
how we earned his $10 million,.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.949
(Pilot) Loki's taken control.

43:46.290 --> 43:50.534
Whoever they are, they're limited
by their own flesh and bones.

43:50.728 --> 43:53.231
Loki will blow them out of the sky.

43:55.166 --> 43:57.510
- (Stringfellow) Sunburst.
- (Dominic) Loaded.

44:03.474 --> 44:05.579
String. String?

44:06.277 --> 44:08.279
(Doc) He's gone out, he's unconscious.

44:08.346 --> 44:10.189
Take over, Doc.

44:10.715 --> 44:12.922
Hang on, I'm killing the engines.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.622
(Doc) You're doing what?

45:03.367 --> 45:05.210
(Doc) What's happening? Was he stalled?

45:05.269 --> 45:06.942
(Dominic) No, he cut his engines.

45:07.004 --> 45:08.244
Where are the rockets on this thing?

45:08.306 --> 45:09.717
(Dominic) Right thumb. Right thumb.

45:09.774 --> 45:11.913
(Doc) Right thumb. Here it goes.

45:34.332 --> 45:36.744
(Dominic) Lord Killebrew,
we radioed for an escort.

45:36.801 --> 45:39.611
Until they arrive, we'll keep you company.

45:39.670 --> 45:42.207
(Killebrew) Gentlemen, I don't
know who you are,

45:42.273 --> 45:43.547
but thank you.

45:45.610 --> 45:48.454
(TV Announcer) And so Lord Killebrew
completes his historic mission

45:48.512 --> 45:51.152
to the peace conference to
inaugurate round-table talks

45:51.215 --> 45:52.489
on the Middle East.

45:52.550 --> 45:54.791
And now, live to Lord Killebrew.

45:54.852 --> 45:58.959
As long as we remember that we
must strive for peace every day,

45:59.156 --> 46:00.897
then one day,

46:00.958 --> 46:02.801
that goal will be ours.

46:03.094 --> 46:04.471
Right on.

46:04.528 --> 46:06.064
Bravo. Bravo.

46:06.130 --> 46:08.440
There's a man worth saving, huh?

46:08.499 --> 46:09.705
You said it.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.769
Badger, look at this.

46:14.972 --> 46:16.918
You did a great job on this.

46:16.974 --> 46:18.112
Thanks.

46:18.209 --> 46:21.747
Hey, you didn't do too bad up
there yourself, considering.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.385
Didn't have much choice, did I?

46:26.984 --> 46:28.395
Well, you know,

46:28.552 --> 46:30.691
if you'd have hurt Dom's lady,

46:30.755 --> 46:33.099
you might have really been in double trouble.

46:33.157 --> 46:34.500
[Dominic laughing]

46:34.558 --> 46:36.367
No, listen,

46:36.427 --> 46:38.065
what I'm try’n to say is that,

46:38.129 --> 46:40.473
see’n as how you lost your rig,

46:41.132 --> 46:44.375
- I wouldn't mind at all…
- What Dom is try’n to say

46:44.769 --> 46:47.113
Doc, is that,

46:48.272 --> 46:50.183
there's always a job open

46:50.241 --> 46:53.654
at Santini Air for a real
hot rod pilot like yourself.

46:55.780 --> 46:57.088
Really?

46:57.381 --> 47:01.591
I don't know. I think I got everything in
the whole world I would want right here.

47:01.652 --> 47:04.428
Unless the pay is fantastic, of course.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.468
- Hey.
- Hey, top dollar.

47:06.524 --> 47:07.559
(Doc) Really?

47:07.625 --> 47:10.071
Except, Dom still thinks it's 1932.
