00:05.213 --> 00:08.214
Mr. Rojas, when questioned
by the Joint Drug Task Force,

00:08.216 --> 00:10.082
you identified the individual

00:10.084 --> 00:12.084
who authorized the murders
of the six victims

00:12.086 --> 00:13.519
in this case.

00:13.521 --> 00:15.354
Correct?

00:18.059 --> 00:19.992
Yes.

00:20.761 --> 00:22.861
Is that individual
present today?

00:29.804 --> 00:31.904
That's him.

00:33.341 --> 00:35.007
Rolando Vega gave the order.

00:36.310 --> 00:38.077
<i>Estás muerto, Javier.</i>

00:38.079 --> 00:39.178
<i>Muerto.</i>

00:39.180 --> 00:40.846
(gavel bangs)

00:40.848 --> 00:42.348
The people rest, Your Honor.

00:42.350 --> 00:43.882
DANNY:
<i>You did good, Javier.</i>

00:43.884 --> 00:45.384
Yeah, I'm a dead man.

00:45.386 --> 00:47.686
Relax. Pretty soon you'll be
on a plane to God knows where

00:47.688 --> 00:49.255
with a drink
and a whole new identity.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.556
You're getting
a fresh start, Javier.

00:50.558 --> 00:51.690
Don't screw it up.

00:51.692 --> 00:52.725
He's all yours, Marshal.

00:52.727 --> 00:54.627
Just what I've always wanted.

00:54.629 --> 00:56.729
Another lucky mutt with
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

00:56.731 --> 00:58.330
JAVIER:
Wait a minute.

00:58.332 --> 00:59.698
You only brought one other guy?

00:59.700 --> 01:02.268
(chuckles) I think we can
handle it, Dillinger.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.602
Catch you guys next time around.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.171
Sure thing.

01:06.173 --> 01:07.506
Marshal, a word?
No.

01:07.508 --> 01:08.540
Hey, Detective?

01:08.542 --> 01:09.608
Hey!

01:09.610 --> 01:11.877
Hey.
Hey, this is a secured area, Andre.

01:11.879 --> 01:13.379
You're not supposed
to be in here,

01:13.381 --> 01:14.413
press or not.

01:14.415 --> 01:15.614
Look, I just need
a minute, Detective.

01:15.616 --> 01:16.849
We already said no.

01:16.851 --> 01:18.484
Rolando Vega was the biggest
drug dealer in New York.

01:18.486 --> 01:20.619
Taking him down is a huge story.
I just want to get it right.

01:20.621 --> 01:23.355
No, you want to make the cover
of the <i> Times.</i>

01:23.357 --> 01:25.224
Yeah, that, too.
This is big news.

01:25.226 --> 01:27.059
You guys were right
in the middle of it.

01:27.061 --> 01:28.627
Well, we don't
do interviews, okay?

01:28.629 --> 01:30.529
Someday, some Hollywood big shot
will buy the life story rights,

01:30.531 --> 01:32.164
and then you can go
see the movie.

01:35.236 --> 01:36.835
Hey!
OFFICER: Hey!

01:36.837 --> 01:38.103
What's the problem?

01:38.105 --> 01:39.305
We don't need no cops, okay?

01:39.307 --> 01:40.606
This is a private matter.

01:40.608 --> 01:41.907
You're being loud
and boisterous.

01:41.909 --> 01:43.175
Lower your volume
or you're going in.

01:43.177 --> 01:44.810
Look, I didn't do
a damn thing, man.

01:44.812 --> 01:46.845
I didn't do a damn...

01:48.282 --> 01:50.449
So, what happened?

01:50.451 --> 01:52.518
Why did our officer's camera
stop functioning?

01:52.520 --> 01:54.119
That's unclear.

01:54.121 --> 01:56.855
What is clear is that
the suspect,

01:56.857 --> 01:58.390
James Prince,
is in the hospital

01:58.392 --> 01:59.591
with a fractured skull.

01:59.593 --> 02:01.827
Officer Taylor said
Prince punched him in the gut.

02:01.829 --> 02:04.263
When he took the guy down,
his head hit the sidewalk.

02:04.265 --> 02:06.565
Prince says Officer Taylor
attacked him

02:06.567 --> 02:07.666
for no reason,
and two witnesses

02:07.668 --> 02:08.834
on the scene back him up.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.336
Reliable witnesses?

02:10.338 --> 02:12.004
Bystanders.
Homies.

02:13.941 --> 02:15.140
Just in this room.

02:15.142 --> 02:18.377
The eyewitnesses are all black
and from the hood.

02:18.379 --> 02:19.478
Race is not an issue here.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.946
Officer Taylor's also black.

02:20.948 --> 02:23.048
In my experience,
in these situations,

02:23.050 --> 02:24.450
Officer Taylor is blue,

02:24.452 --> 02:26.318
as in the uniform he wears.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.520
(chuckles) Oh, that's gonna
play just great.

02:28.522 --> 02:30.089
Well, I'm just calling it
what it is, all right?

02:30.091 --> 02:32.458
This body-worn camera program
is nothing but trouble

02:32.460 --> 02:35.227
for the cop on the beat,
and I'm not here

02:35.229 --> 02:36.528
to put whipped cream on it.

02:36.530 --> 02:37.696
That's enough.

02:37.698 --> 02:39.865
Look, I signed off

02:39.867 --> 02:41.834
on this pilot program

02:41.836 --> 02:42.868
because I had no choice.

02:42.870 --> 02:44.703
The mayor wanted it.

02:44.705 --> 02:47.506
Which means out there
in the world, I want it.

02:47.508 --> 02:49.808
Which also means,
because you work for me,

02:49.810 --> 02:51.076
that you want it.

02:51.078 --> 02:52.711
Understood?
Yes, sir.

02:52.713 --> 02:53.389
Thank you.

02:53.413 --> 02:55.624
And no, I will not hold
a press conference.

02:56.083 --> 02:57.683
But the story's out there.

02:57.685 --> 03:01.320
And the usual anti-cop suspects
are already making noise.

03:01.322 --> 03:03.789
Ask the mayor's staff
to field it.

03:03.791 --> 03:05.057
They won't; you know that.

03:05.059 --> 03:07.926
Ask the manufacturer
of the camera to stand up there.

03:07.928 --> 03:09.094
Oh, now you're just being...

03:09.096 --> 03:10.295
Did the camera malfunction?

03:10.297 --> 03:11.563
Did our officer turn it off?

03:11.565 --> 03:13.866
Do we have the answer
to either of those questions?

03:13.868 --> 03:16.135
No. The manufacturer
is examining the camera.

03:16.137 --> 03:17.503
It'll take a few days.

03:17.505 --> 03:18.904
I will hold a press conference

03:18.906 --> 03:21.173
when I have the black box
in this.

03:21.175 --> 03:23.041
And not a moment before.

03:23.043 --> 03:25.210
Understood?

03:30.117 --> 03:32.184
ERIN: <i> I'm so happy</i>
<i>you stopped by, Hannah.</i>

03:32.186 --> 03:34.953
Well, thanks for seeing me,
Mrs. Reagan.

03:34.955 --> 03:36.555
I know how busy you are.

03:36.557 --> 03:40.392
I think it's time you can
start calling me Erin.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.261
How's your freshman year
at Hudson?

03:42.263 --> 03:43.829
It's been okay.

03:43.831 --> 03:44.963
Yeah?

03:44.965 --> 03:45.965
It's a great school.

03:45.966 --> 03:47.166
Nikki had a hard time deciding

03:47.168 --> 03:48.634
between there and Columbia.

03:48.636 --> 03:50.536
Yeah, we-we talked about it.

03:50.538 --> 03:52.204
How's your mom?

03:52.206 --> 03:54.573
We have a school reunion
coming up,

03:54.575 --> 03:56.208
and I am not going without her.

03:56.210 --> 03:58.243
She...

03:58.245 --> 04:00.813
doesn't know I'm here.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.716
Okay.

04:04.718 --> 04:06.752
Is there something wrong?

04:09.890 --> 04:11.590
(sobs)
Okay.

04:11.592 --> 04:13.058
Okay.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.359
Just take a breath.

04:14.361 --> 04:16.028
I'm sorry.

04:16.029 --> 04:17.529
I didn't...

04:17.531 --> 04:19.765
I didn't know who else
to-to call.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.966
Come on,
sit down.

04:24.038 --> 04:26.104
Okay.

04:26.106 --> 04:27.539
Tell me what's happening.

04:27.541 --> 04:29.107
Thank you.

04:29.109 --> 04:31.009
There...

04:31.011 --> 04:34.680
There was a party, um,
in the dorm.

04:34.682 --> 04:36.448
I was drinking

04:36.450 --> 04:38.417
with some of the guys,

04:38.419 --> 04:40.819
soccer players.

04:40.821 --> 04:43.822
One of them...

04:43.824 --> 04:46.124
Darren Bentley...

04:47.328 --> 04:49.461
He was cute and-and funny,

04:49.463 --> 04:51.363
and everything seemed fine.

04:51.365 --> 04:52.431
(sighs)

04:52.433 --> 04:54.366
We made out

04:54.368 --> 04:56.034
for a while,

04:56.036 --> 04:57.870
and...

04:57.872 --> 04:59.137
It's okay.

04:59.139 --> 05:00.906
Go on.

05:01.709 --> 05:03.775
He...

05:03.777 --> 05:05.978
threw me down

05:05.980 --> 05:08.881
on the bed.

05:08.883 --> 05:11.049
(sighs)

05:12.887 --> 05:14.186
(crying)

05:15.589 --> 05:16.989
Did he rape you?

05:20.861 --> 05:22.261
Yeah. (sniffles)

05:22.263 --> 05:24.429
(sobs)

05:29.870 --> 05:31.803
When did this happen?

05:31.805 --> 05:34.039
Uh... (sniffles)

05:34.041 --> 05:36.008
Um...

05:36.010 --> 05:37.609
Uh, three months ago.

05:37.611 --> 05:39.411
During freshman orientation.

05:39.413 --> 05:41.580
(sighs)

05:43.050 --> 05:45.217
Did you have
a rape kit performed?

05:46.487 --> 05:48.287
No.

05:48.289 --> 05:51.757
I just wanted to pretend
it didn't happen.

05:51.759 --> 05:54.660
I talked to the dean
of students.

05:56.096 --> 05:58.764
She said that the school had

05:58.766 --> 06:01.700
its own disciplinary system.

06:01.702 --> 06:03.669
That it would take less time,

06:03.671 --> 06:05.904
and I could remain anonymous.

06:05.906 --> 06:07.239
And was there a hearing?

06:07.241 --> 06:09.074
It was a nightmare.

06:09.076 --> 06:11.043
No one there

06:11.045 --> 06:12.544
was on my side.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.947
They didn't even care
about what happened.

06:14.949 --> 06:18.083
They just wanted it all
to go away.

06:18.085 --> 06:20.919
And what happened to this guy?

06:20.921 --> 06:22.521
Darren?

06:22.523 --> 06:24.856
He wasn't even punished.

06:26.694 --> 06:28.160
I have to see him

06:28.162 --> 06:30.629
on campus

06:30.631 --> 06:33.465
every day.

06:33.467 --> 06:35.634
And every time I do, it...

06:35.636 --> 06:37.903
(softly):
Okay.

06:42.142 --> 06:44.376
Does your mom know
what happened?

06:44.378 --> 06:45.777
Mm-mm.

06:45.779 --> 06:48.747
I just, I'm barely
holding it together right now.

06:48.749 --> 06:50.716
And she'll freak out,
and I just,

06:50.718 --> 06:53.352
I ca-- I can't handle that.

06:53.354 --> 06:55.554
Please, please, don't tell her.

06:55.556 --> 06:58.156
Okay, I promise
I won't tell her.

06:58.158 --> 07:00.258
Okay?
Yeah.

07:37.174 --> 07:39.374

JAVIER:
Detective!

07:43.049 --> 07:45.022
Detective Reagan!

07:46.596 --> 07:48.074
Come out of there.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.736
What in the hell
are you doing here, Javier?

07:54.760 --> 07:57.287
Your boy, Morgan,
he screwed me over.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.115
What are you talking about?
He told me that my lawyer messed up.

07:59.115 --> 08:01.716
That my deal for protection
wasn't binding.

08:01.718 --> 08:03.418
So then they take
me to their office,

08:03.420 --> 08:04.953
they open the car door,
they say, "You're free to go."

08:04.955 --> 08:07.288
There must be
some mistake, okay?

08:07.290 --> 08:08.623
Yeah, you know what
my mistake was?

08:08.625 --> 08:10.725
Trusting a damn cop
to keep his word.

08:10.727 --> 08:11.592
Why don't you watch your mouth?

08:11.594 --> 08:13.528
I put my ass
on the line for you.

08:13.530 --> 08:15.029
You know,
I won't last five minutes

08:15.031 --> 08:16.564
once Vega finds out
I'm on the street.

08:16.566 --> 08:17.699
Well, that's not gonna happen.

08:17.701 --> 08:19.367
You know what they do to rats?

08:19.369 --> 08:21.402
They cut you up nice and slow

08:21.404 --> 08:22.837
until you beg to die.

08:22.839 --> 08:24.939
All right, look, just don't
wet your pants, all right?

08:24.941 --> 08:26.341
I got somewhere to take you.

08:26.343 --> 08:27.742
Like I'm gonna trust you again?
Listen,

08:27.744 --> 08:29.577
if you had a better plan,
that's what you'd be doing,

08:29.579 --> 08:31.746
so you're gonna have to trust me.
What the hell are you doing?

08:31.748 --> 08:33.481
Just because I'm helping you

08:33.482 --> 08:35.049
doesn't mean I trust you.

08:35.051 --> 08:36.317
Get in.

08:37.253 --> 08:38.653
There's a rally planned

08:38.655 --> 08:40.154
on the block
where James Prince was hurt.

08:40.155 --> 08:41.589
Do they have a permit?

08:41.591 --> 08:42.600
I don't know.

08:42.624 --> 08:43.993
Ask patrol to make sure
they have one.

08:43.994 --> 08:46.260
If they don't, make it easy
for them to get one.

08:46.262 --> 08:49.063
I don't want grief
on top of grief here.

08:49.065 --> 08:50.698
Come on in, Sergeant.

08:54.371 --> 08:55.737
I've had a dozen phone calls

08:55.739 --> 08:57.538
from the new president
of our union.

08:57.540 --> 08:59.540
"Our" being the police union?

08:59.542 --> 09:01.642
Yes, sir,
and he's really pissed off.

09:01.644 --> 09:03.911
Why? Did I forget to buy
a raffle ticket?

09:03.913 --> 09:07.815
He feels like your silence is
not supporting Officer Taylor.

09:07.817 --> 09:09.183
Well, then he is
misunderstanding it.

09:09.185 --> 09:10.952
My silence
isn't supporting anything

09:10.954 --> 09:15.256
but a thorough investigation
before I shoot my mouth off.

09:15.258 --> 09:17.525
Not what they were looking for.

09:17.527 --> 09:20.528
Too bad-- the commissioner
doesn't serve at his pleasure.

09:20.530 --> 09:22.130
You can tell him or I will.

09:22.132 --> 09:23.398
FRANK: And what are
they looking for?

09:23.400 --> 09:24.866
My knee-jerk reaction

09:24.868 --> 09:26.200
to take Taylor's side

09:26.202 --> 09:28.236
because we wear
the same uniform?

09:28.238 --> 09:29.238
Pretty much, yeah.

09:29.239 --> 09:31.372
This situation
is bad enough without

09:31.374 --> 09:33.608
the commissioner looking like
he's covering for a bad cop.

09:33.610 --> 09:36.277
There's zero evidence
that Taylor did anything wrong.

09:36.279 --> 09:39.213
There's zero evidence,
period, right now.

09:39.215 --> 09:42.050
I'm just saying,
with cops being blamed

09:42.052 --> 09:44.385
for everything under the sun
these days,

09:44.387 --> 09:47.388
they just want the commissioner
to stand up for them.

09:51.961 --> 09:53.528
Sounds like you agree with him.

09:53.530 --> 09:56.397
I represent the guys
in the street.

09:56.399 --> 09:58.166
If I don't tell you
what they're thinking,

09:58.168 --> 09:59.434
I'm not doing my job.

09:59.436 --> 10:00.701
(sighs)

10:00.703 --> 10:03.071
Well, then here's my reply
to the men on the street

10:03.073 --> 10:04.138
and the president

10:04.140 --> 10:05.606
of the union.

10:05.608 --> 10:09.110
If they want me to come down
hard on Officer Taylor's side,

10:09.112 --> 10:12.213
then go out there
and do the police work

10:12.215 --> 10:15.416
that gives me
the evidence to do so.

10:15.418 --> 10:17.051
Yes, sir.

10:18.254 --> 10:21.289
(sighs)

10:22.092 --> 10:24.192
ERIN:
<i>Thank you for making time</i>

10:24.194 --> 10:25.793
to see me, Dean Walters.

10:25.795 --> 10:26.894
Of course.

10:26.896 --> 10:29.297
This is Matt Douglas,
our university counsel.

10:29.299 --> 10:32.066
Erin Reagan.

10:35.105 --> 10:36.137
Didn't realize that
the school's attorney

10:36.139 --> 10:37.472
would be joining us.

10:38.608 --> 10:40.241
University policy
dictates I be present

10:40.243 --> 10:42.810
for any discussion of
our disciplinary process.

10:42.812 --> 10:44.579
Is that policy in place
to protect the students,

10:44.581 --> 10:45.813
or the school?

10:45.815 --> 10:47.415
I assure you,

10:47.417 --> 10:49.851
the welfare of our students
is our top priority.

10:49.853 --> 10:52.186
I find that hard to believe

10:52.188 --> 10:54.355
when you counsel
traumatized female students

10:54.357 --> 10:55.456
like Hannah Lancaster

10:55.458 --> 10:58.159
not to report sexual assault
to the police.

10:58.161 --> 11:01.529
I made sure Hannah understood
all her options.

11:01.531 --> 11:04.532
She chose the one that
best served her interests.

11:04.534 --> 11:07.335
Not to mention
the interests of the school:

11:07.337 --> 11:09.871
avoiding negative press

11:09.873 --> 11:12.106
that might discourage
potential students,

11:12.108 --> 11:13.908
donating alumni...

11:13.910 --> 11:15.610
Ms. Lancaster isn't a minor.

11:15.612 --> 11:17.078
Neither she nor
the university

11:17.080 --> 11:18.846
had any legal obligation

11:18.848 --> 11:21.082
to report her alleged assault
to the police.

11:21.084 --> 11:23.151
Yes, I know the law,
Mr. Douglas.

11:23.153 --> 11:26.487
I also know that during
Hannah's disciplinary hearing,

11:26.489 --> 11:27.922
no relevant witnesses
were called

11:27.924 --> 11:29.023
and no medical

11:29.025 --> 11:31.025
evidence was introduced.

11:31.027 --> 11:32.693
These were freshmen, Ms. Reagan.

11:32.695 --> 11:35.596
Away from home for the first
time, drinking alcohol...

11:35.598 --> 11:38.966
Sometimes...
misunderstandings occur.

11:38.968 --> 11:41.636
Misunderstandings like rape?

11:41.638 --> 11:44.305
This was a very
unfortunate incident.

11:44.307 --> 11:46.340
But we have nothing to hide.

11:46.342 --> 11:47.842
Good.

11:47.844 --> 11:50.678
Because I intend to fully
investigate this matter.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.447
What is that?

11:53.449 --> 11:55.249
It's a subpoena.

11:55.251 --> 11:57.785
Please have all
materials relating

11:57.787 --> 12:00.721
to Hannah's case forwarded
to my office immediately.

12:07.797 --> 12:09.897
Hey, Reagan.

12:09.899 --> 12:11.599
Filling out
an application?

12:11.601 --> 12:13.100
What happened to Javier Rojas?

12:13.102 --> 12:13.901
What do you mean?

12:13.903 --> 12:15.136
He showed up at my precinct

12:15.138 --> 12:16.304
saying you went back on the deal

12:16.306 --> 12:17.471
for witness
protection.

12:17.473 --> 12:18.873
His shyster lawyer
screwed the pooch.

12:18.875 --> 12:19.941
What are you
talking about?

12:19.943 --> 12:21.275
Made his inclusion
in WITSEC

12:21.277 --> 12:23.444
subject to the discretion
of the Marshal Service.

12:23.446 --> 12:24.946
That's not the deal we made.

12:24.948 --> 12:27.148
It is, according to the federal
prosecutor running this case.

12:27.150 --> 12:30.051
My partner and I promised
this guy protection.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.786
Rojas is a murdering
hump, Reagan.

12:31.788 --> 12:34.021
Don't give a damn what
he is-- he gave us Vega,

12:34.023 --> 12:35.723
and a deal is a deal.
Look...

12:35.725 --> 12:39.927
every scumbag rat we put into
WITSEC costs us serious money.

12:39.929 --> 12:41.862
We got budgets,
like everybody else.

12:41.864 --> 12:43.397
That's a load of crap.
All right?

12:43.399 --> 12:44.732
And if you go back on the deal,

12:44.734 --> 12:46.167
you're as good as putting him
in the ground yourself.

12:46.169 --> 12:49.670
One less drug-dealing skel?

12:49.672 --> 12:51.672
Sorry if I don't
break down and cry.

12:51.674 --> 12:53.407
If Rojas hired

12:53.409 --> 12:55.042
a crappy lawyer,
that's his problem.

12:55.044 --> 12:56.844
He's on his own.

13:01.584 --> 13:04.085
Rojas' deal was negotiated
by a federal prosecutor.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.953
Yeah, but it was
a joint operation.

13:05.955 --> 13:07.388
There's gotta be
something we can do.

13:07.390 --> 13:09.290
Without
Javier Rojas,

13:09.292 --> 13:11.425
there's no way the feds
can take Vega down.

13:11.427 --> 13:12.393
Yeah, Vega.

13:12.395 --> 13:13.561
A murdering
son of a bitch

13:13.563 --> 13:14.795
the feds haven't been able

13:14.797 --> 13:16.530
to get their hands
on in four years!

13:16.532 --> 13:17.832
It was a great collar.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.967
But it was a federal operation.

13:19.969 --> 13:22.103
We just availed our C.I.
to them.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.771
<i>Our</i> C.I.

13:23.773 --> 13:25.039
And we promised
this guy protection

13:25.041 --> 13:26.240
and now we're not
protecting him.

13:26.242 --> 13:27.675
And the marshals
backed us up.

13:27.677 --> 13:30.077
Marshals backed us
up, all right...

13:30.079 --> 13:31.212
until they didn't.

13:31.214 --> 13:32.680
Where is Rojas now?

13:32.682 --> 13:35.449
We're sitting on him
in an apartment downtown.

13:35.451 --> 13:36.550
Look...

13:36.552 --> 13:38.653
you guys have a right
to be pissed off.

13:38.655 --> 13:40.521
But there's nothing we can do.

13:41.758 --> 13:43.658
So we just feed this guy
to the sharks?

13:43.660 --> 13:45.860
DANNY: Look, we're not
the feds, boss.

13:45.862 --> 13:47.928
We gave this guy our word.

13:47.930 --> 13:49.530
This isn't how we operate.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.333
I'm sorry.

13:52.335 --> 13:54.435
My hands are tied.

13:54.437 --> 13:57.505
Put Rojas back on the street.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:10.541 --> 14:12.208
You lying son of a bitch!

14:12.210 --> 14:13.275
You're cops!

14:13.277 --> 14:15.211
You're supposed to be
the good guys!

14:15.213 --> 14:16.378
We are the good guys.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.047
But the feds...
well, they're the feds.

14:18.049 --> 14:20.149
And we can't force them
to honor the deal.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.451
You had nothing without me.

14:22.453 --> 14:24.753
I didn't have
to help you guys.

14:24.755 --> 14:26.255
You're not exactly a Good
Samaritan here, Javier.

14:26.257 --> 14:28.057
We had
you cold

14:28.059 --> 14:29.725
on sale of a
controlled substance

14:29.727 --> 14:30.960
and accessory
to murder.

14:30.962 --> 14:32.061
You were looking at 20 years!

14:32.063 --> 14:34.129
You testified
to save your own ass.

14:34.131 --> 14:36.665
But I did what I said
I was gonna do.

14:37.602 --> 14:39.134
Can you say that?

14:39.136 --> 14:41.136
(sighs)

14:41.138 --> 14:43.105
We promised you
we'd find a way out of this

14:43.107 --> 14:44.139
and we will.

14:44.141 --> 14:44.974
Danny...

14:44.976 --> 14:46.008
DANNY:
Do not leave

14:46.010 --> 14:47.076
this apartment.

14:47.078 --> 14:48.544
Do you
understand?

14:48.546 --> 14:50.679
We'll be back later.

14:51.482 --> 14:53.682
Come on and lock the door.

14:55.052 --> 14:56.685
What are you
doing, Danny?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.120
Carver told us
to cut him loose.

14:58.122 --> 14:59.488
I don't give a damn
what Carver said.

14:59.490 --> 15:00.723
We're not breaking
our word for anyone,

15:00.725 --> 15:01.657
not even the boss.

15:01.659 --> 15:03.158
What do you want
to do, then?

15:03.160 --> 15:04.693
If the feds won't
disappear this guy,

15:04.695 --> 15:06.428
then we will.

15:08.666 --> 15:09.832
Here you go.

15:09.834 --> 15:12.101
Thank you.
Sit down.

15:15.106 --> 15:18.841
This is, uh,
not a privileged conversation,

15:18.843 --> 15:20.976
Officer Taylor.

15:20.978 --> 15:22.578
So if you're charged,

15:22.580 --> 15:25.981
whatever you say to me
is fair game in court.

15:25.983 --> 15:27.516
I've got nothing to hide.

15:27.518 --> 15:28.550
Okay.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.919
What happened out there?

15:30.921 --> 15:33.188
I'm walking a foot post

15:33.190 --> 15:34.523
and I come up on the suspect

15:34.525 --> 15:36.225
going after a guy
locked in a car.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.626
Says the guy owes him money.

15:37.628 --> 15:40.062
Well, we have that
on your body cam.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.330
What happened next?

15:42.933 --> 15:45.034
Suspect wouldn't calm down.

15:45.036 --> 15:47.403
I tell him to lower the volume
or he's going in.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.438
Next thing I know,
he punches me.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.075
So I put him on the ground
in an effort to subdue him.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.843
He must've hit his head.

15:57.148 --> 16:00.582
To me, sounds like
a clean arrest

16:00.584 --> 16:02.918
with an unfortunate outcome.

16:04.121 --> 16:05.487
I didn't mean to hurt him.

16:05.489 --> 16:07.289
He escalated the situation.

16:07.291 --> 16:09.425
I mean, you hit a cop,
all bets are off.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.460
Sure would be nice

16:11.462 --> 16:13.729
if we had the rest of
the incident on video.

16:13.731 --> 16:15.197
Yes, sir.

16:16.567 --> 16:18.634
I've been wearing that camera
for almost three weeks.

16:18.636 --> 16:20.169
I've never had a problem before.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.673
And you didn't turn it off

16:24.675 --> 16:27.242
so you could
tune up James Prince

16:27.244 --> 16:29.011
without an audience?

16:29.013 --> 16:31.080
No, sir.

16:31.082 --> 16:34.249
I don't know what went
wrong with my camera,

16:34.251 --> 16:35.684
but I know one thing for sure.

16:35.686 --> 16:37.619
I did my job.

16:37.621 --> 16:40.622
No more, no less.

16:48.999 --> 16:52.134
So you're saying he's going
to get away with it?

16:52.136 --> 16:54.169
I'm saying he got a lawyer

16:54.171 --> 16:55.804
and he's sticking by his story.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.407
His story is a lie.

16:58.409 --> 17:01.710
And once I can prove that,
I will charge him.

17:01.712 --> 17:03.512
(sighs)

17:03.514 --> 17:05.079
God, I can't believe this!

17:07.017 --> 17:08.817
I'm sorry.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.519
I'm sorry, I...

17:10.521 --> 17:12.020
I know that you are doing
everything you can.

17:12.021 --> 17:13.288
I just, I feel so...

17:13.290 --> 17:15.156
angry and helpless...

17:15.159 --> 17:16.791
I know, I know.

17:16.794 --> 17:17.826
Please, don't worry.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.627
I have an investigator
on campus now.

17:19.630 --> 17:23.332
I promise I'll call you
once I hear any news.

17:27.637 --> 17:29.271
Your mother called
me last night.

17:29.273 --> 17:32.274
I'm glad you told her.

17:32.276 --> 17:34.943
Was it as bad as you
thought it would be?

17:34.945 --> 17:37.880
Uh, actually...

17:37.882 --> 17:39.882
it's the first time
I've felt like myself

17:39.884 --> 17:40.884
since all this happened.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.084
Good.

17:43.454 --> 17:44.987
You stay in touch, okay?

17:44.989 --> 17:45.989
Okay.

17:45.990 --> 17:47.089
Thanks.

17:47.091 --> 17:49.258
Thank you.

17:50.961 --> 17:53.495
My father sends his regards.

17:54.432 --> 17:56.265
When I got shot
in the line of duty,

17:56.267 --> 17:58.967
your old man made sure my
family was taken care of.

17:58.969 --> 18:00.436
Hell of a guy.

18:00.438 --> 18:02.337
Yeah, I agree.

18:02.339 --> 18:04.506
Then again,
I'm kind of biased.

18:05.976 --> 18:08.010
I wanted to talk to you
about Hannah Lancaster.

18:08.012 --> 18:09.745
Nice girl.

18:09.747 --> 18:11.847
Felt real bad
about what happened.

18:11.849 --> 18:13.582
Well, did she or anyone else

18:13.584 --> 18:15.317
report the incident
to your office that night?

18:15.319 --> 18:16.418
No.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.587
Got a call a few weeks
after it happened

18:18.589 --> 18:20.489
from the dean
of students.

18:20.491 --> 18:22.024
Yeah.
Janet Walters.

18:22.026 --> 18:22.991
Yeah.

18:22.993 --> 18:24.226
Hannah had reached
out to her.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.428
The dean asked me to collect
physical evidence

18:26.430 --> 18:27.729
from the girl's dorm room.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.565
Wait. What evidence?

18:29.567 --> 18:32.134
Hannah still had the skirt
she wore that night.

18:32.136 --> 18:33.502
It was torn up pretty good.

18:33.504 --> 18:35.537
Had what looked
like bloodstains on it.

18:35.539 --> 18:36.805
Where's that skirt now?

18:36.807 --> 18:39.942
I delivered it
to the dean's office.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.443
Figured she'd call NYPD.

18:41.445 --> 18:44.012
I guess Hannah decided
to go a different way.

18:49.887 --> 18:52.654
Pork jerky, cuchifritos
and orange soda?

18:52.656 --> 18:54.556
If Vega doesn't kill Javier,
his diet will.

18:54.558 --> 18:55.824
Yeah, well, hopefully
no one will kill him...

18:55.826 --> 18:56.758
(loud clattering)

18:56.760 --> 18:58.494
JAVIER:
No!

18:58.496 --> 19:01.663
No! No!

19:01.665 --> 19:03.866
It's open.
(groaning)

19:06.036 --> 19:07.736
Police! Drop it!

19:07.738 --> 19:09.738
Shoot 'em!
Shoot 'em!

19:09.740 --> 19:11.240
Shut your mouth, Javier!
Drop it!

19:11.242 --> 19:13.408
Drop it!

19:14.011 --> 19:16.011
Get on the floor.
Now!

19:16.013 --> 19:18.313
Step away, Javier.
Hands on the back of your head.

19:18.315 --> 19:20.549
Now!

19:22.419 --> 19:23.986
We gotta get Javier out of here.
DANNY: I know.

19:23.988 --> 19:27.756
JAVIER:
I told you this would happen.

19:27.758 --> 19:29.258
If Rolando's guys
can find me here,

19:29.260 --> 19:30.692
they'll track me down
wherever I go.

19:30.694 --> 19:33.228
Shut your mouth
or I'll kill you myself!

19:34.565 --> 19:36.164
Cuffs.
Keep an eye on him.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.299
What do you
want to do?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.868
I don't know, I'm thinking.

19:39.870 --> 19:41.503
I'll have a radio car
pick them up.

19:41.505 --> 19:43.472
Great. After we
get this jackass

19:43.474 --> 19:44.973
out of here.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.743
Give me your hands.
Over there.

19:47.745 --> 19:49.545
I know where we can take him.

19:49.547 --> 19:51.580
It might get us more jammed
up than we already are,

19:51.582 --> 19:52.582
but who the hell cares?

19:52.583 --> 19:54.716
Get outside. Go!

20:06.065 --> 20:07.264
You should be safe here.

20:07.266 --> 20:10.367
At least until we can
get you out of town, Javier.

20:10.369 --> 20:12.837
That's what you said
about the last place.

20:12.839 --> 20:14.338
You know, I'm getting
a little sick

20:14.340 --> 20:15.873
of your attitude.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.475
You almost got me killed.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.243
No, you almost got
yourself killed.

20:19.245 --> 20:20.811
I didn't get you into
this mess, you did!

20:20.813 --> 20:22.847
I'm the one that's trying
to get you out of it!

20:22.849 --> 20:25.382
You know what?
You want to leave?

20:25.384 --> 20:27.117
How about...

20:27.119 --> 20:29.286
you take your chances out there
in the real world, huh?

20:29.288 --> 20:30.354
You don't want my help?

20:30.356 --> 20:31.589
You want to be
a pain in the ass?

20:31.591 --> 20:32.756
How about you go
out there and see

20:32.758 --> 20:34.325
if you can make it,
all right?

20:34.327 --> 20:35.726
Otherwise, I suggest
you shut your mouth

20:35.728 --> 20:38.195
and be grateful
you're still alive.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.130
(shushes)

20:40.132 --> 20:41.832
What?

20:48.508 --> 20:49.974
(door closes)

20:49.976 --> 20:52.209
Funny.

20:52.211 --> 20:54.945
That looked like Javier Rojas.

20:54.947 --> 20:56.747
But I know
that can't be him

20:56.749 --> 20:59.416
because I ordered you
to cut him loose.

20:59.418 --> 21:01.585
He's got a contract
on his head, boss.

21:01.587 --> 21:03.754
Just like the last time
we talked.

21:04.790 --> 21:08.425
You're on very thin ice,
Detectives.

21:08.427 --> 21:11.795
I want him out
of this house tonight.

21:11.797 --> 21:13.998
And I want to see
both of you in my office

21:14.000 --> 21:16.901
first thing Monday morning.

21:26.178 --> 21:27.878
If the mayor back in my day

21:27.880 --> 21:30.080
had ordered me
to put cameras on my men...

21:30.082 --> 21:31.615
You would've done it
or lost your job.

21:31.617 --> 21:33.651
Same as in my day.
Yeah.

21:33.653 --> 21:36.220
But I would have made sure
that any cop wearing a camera

21:36.222 --> 21:39.423
would be walking
a very quiet beat.

21:39.425 --> 21:41.258
DANNY:
Yeah, except in your day,

21:41.260 --> 21:43.961
they'd be wearing
a giant automatic

21:43.963 --> 21:46.330
Cop-O-Vision camera
the size of a shoebox.

21:46.332 --> 21:47.965
(chuckles)

21:47.967 --> 21:50.167
Hey, perp, say cheese.

21:50.169 --> 21:51.802
That's not the point.

21:51.804 --> 21:53.437
No, it's not.
Just because we have

21:53.439 --> 21:55.472
the technology to do something

21:55.474 --> 21:58.042
doesn't automatically
make it a good idea.

21:58.044 --> 21:59.944
Oh, yeah?
I thought you were for this.

21:59.946 --> 22:01.211
Where'd you hear that?

22:01.213 --> 22:03.747
Well, I read it in an article
in the paper last week.

22:03.749 --> 22:05.215
Well, you can't believe
everything you read

22:05.217 --> 22:06.850
in the papers
where he's concerned.

22:06.852 --> 22:08.285
Erin's right.

22:08.287 --> 22:11.121
I have to be for it...
in the papers.

22:11.123 --> 22:13.490
But did this start
with the NYPD saying,

22:13.492 --> 22:15.459
"Hey, let's try this.

22:15.461 --> 22:16.694
It's gonna be good for us"?

22:16.696 --> 22:18.662
No. It came from outside.

22:18.664 --> 22:20.364
Everything's on cameras
these days, though.

22:20.366 --> 22:21.665
JACK: Yeah, and people
are taking videos

22:21.667 --> 22:23.701
of the cops,
so why can't they shoot back?

22:23.703 --> 22:26.470
Because they have
guns to shoot back.

22:26.472 --> 22:28.772
Because it makes it seem like
the public doesn't trust

22:28.774 --> 22:30.107
the police anymore; like we need

22:30.109 --> 22:32.643
surveillance cameras
to police the police.

22:32.645 --> 22:34.578
A lot of people don't
trust cops-- it's a fact.

22:34.580 --> 22:36.680
Let them try living
without us for a week.

22:36.682 --> 22:40.384
And if wearing a camera proves
to be some kind of magic bullet

22:40.386 --> 22:43.320
in getting everyone
to trust our cops,

22:43.322 --> 22:45.956
I'm all for it,
but I haven't seen that.

22:45.958 --> 22:48.025
What I do see

22:48.027 --> 22:50.861
is an assumption that a cop
will turn the camera off

22:50.863 --> 22:54.865
if he wants to hide
what he's about to do.

22:54.867 --> 22:58.235
An assumption.

22:58.237 --> 23:00.170
Think Taylor

23:00.172 --> 23:01.872
turned his camera off
to tune that guy up?

23:01.874 --> 23:02.973
Oh, I don't know.

23:02.975 --> 23:04.475
I sure hope not.

23:04.477 --> 23:07.711
But the larger issue here
really bothers me.

23:07.713 --> 23:10.280
We are laying down precedent

23:10.282 --> 23:12.850
that a cop's word,

23:12.852 --> 23:15.119
a man's word,

23:15.121 --> 23:17.154
isn't any good unless there is

23:17.156 --> 23:19.156
a real-time digital recording

23:19.158 --> 23:21.592
to back it up.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.335
Not to leave this room.

23:35.574 --> 23:37.841
(quietly):
Yeah.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.780
It's a cautionary tale.

23:42.782 --> 23:45.949
It's important to make choices
that help keep you safe.

23:45.951 --> 23:47.685
Everyone drinks at college, Mom.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.154
Alcohol impairs your judgment.

23:50.156 --> 23:51.855
It's not about blame.
It's a fact.

23:51.857 --> 23:54.258
He was just some guy
from her dorm.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.827
Who she had only known
for a few hours.

23:56.829 --> 23:58.362
That doesn't excuse what he did.

23:58.364 --> 23:59.763
Not in a million years.

23:59.765 --> 24:01.965
But in the end...

24:05.071 --> 24:09.139
...the only one
who can keep you safe is you.

24:15.081 --> 24:16.613
GARRETT:
You're not listening.

24:16.615 --> 24:17.748
I'm saying it's over.

24:17.750 --> 24:20.417
The manufacturer found
a faulty sensor

24:20.419 --> 24:21.785
in Officer Taylor's body camera.

24:21.787 --> 24:24.655
I am listening, but how
does that make it over?

24:24.657 --> 24:25.989
The camera malfunctioned.

24:25.991 --> 24:27.858
Taylor didn't turn it off.
It went off.

24:27.860 --> 24:28.959
Not good enough.

24:28.961 --> 24:30.394
Why not?
You tell that

24:30.396 --> 24:31.695
to the people
in that neighborhood,

24:31.697 --> 24:33.464
all you're gonna get
is a good laugh.

24:33.466 --> 24:36.500
Sometimes the truth
has to suffice.

24:36.502 --> 24:38.569
You use that word "suffice" and
you'll get an even bigger laugh

24:38.571 --> 24:40.604
with a couple of beer bottles
tossed at you.

24:40.606 --> 24:42.306
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

24:42.308 --> 24:44.074
You're doing your job.

24:44.076 --> 24:46.977
Part of which is to help
me figure out how to show

24:46.979 --> 24:49.680
this department
in the very best light.

24:51.117 --> 24:54.284
And we've only got part
of the black box.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.652
What's the other part?

24:55.654 --> 24:58.322
What did happen when
the camera went off.

24:58.324 --> 25:00.424
(indistinct arguing on TV)
There.

25:00.426 --> 25:02.025
You see it?

25:05.598 --> 25:07.030
You lost me.

25:07.032 --> 25:08.799
Keep your day job.

25:12.138 --> 25:13.670
How about you, Sergeant?

25:15.508 --> 25:18.041
Actually, we interviewed
that woman.

25:18.944 --> 25:20.477
Oh.

25:20.479 --> 25:21.912
She said she didn't

25:21.914 --> 25:22.980
record anything.

25:22.982 --> 25:24.314
She was on a speakerphone,

25:24.316 --> 25:25.849
having a conversation.

25:25.851 --> 25:27.384
Or maybe not.

25:27.386 --> 25:30.320
You know,
we chose that neighborhood

25:30.322 --> 25:33.023
for the pilot program
because it had

25:33.025 --> 25:36.493
the highest rate of civilian
complaints in the city.

25:36.495 --> 25:38.495
We're not very
popular up there.

25:38.497 --> 25:40.197
So what do we do?

25:40.199 --> 25:41.231
Offer her something.

25:41.233 --> 25:42.866
Some kind of reward.

25:42.868 --> 25:44.334
Get a subpoena,
seize it as evidence

25:44.336 --> 25:46.170
and dump her phone.

25:46.172 --> 25:48.472
Bribe her? Force her?

25:48.474 --> 25:50.841
That's the best we can do?

25:50.843 --> 25:53.177
Look, we're trying
to clear our man,

25:53.179 --> 25:55.312
but we're also trying
to gain the trust

25:55.314 --> 25:58.982
and respect of the people
in that community.

25:58.984 --> 26:01.552
It's not a victory
if we don't have both.

26:05.257 --> 26:06.723
(knocking)

26:06.725 --> 26:08.492
Hey.

26:08.494 --> 26:09.693
Hey.

26:09.695 --> 26:10.828
Thanks for stopping by.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.663
Sure. Is there a problem?

26:12.665 --> 26:15.933
I still don't have
anyone to go with me

26:15.935 --> 26:16.935
to the mayor's reception

26:16.936 --> 26:19.336
for the AG.

26:19.338 --> 26:21.004
That is a problem.

26:21.006 --> 26:23.273
You sure you won't reconsider?

26:23.275 --> 26:24.908
Who have you asked?

26:24.910 --> 26:26.076
A few people.

26:26.078 --> 26:27.277
Name two.

26:29.915 --> 26:31.682
How's your case going?

26:34.253 --> 26:36.119
My investigator just delivered

26:36.121 --> 26:37.888
Hannah's torn skirt from
the night of the attack.

26:37.890 --> 26:40.691
The dean of students
apologized

26:40.693 --> 26:42.559
for not turning it
over right away.

26:42.561 --> 26:44.928
Claims that it was misplaced.

26:44.930 --> 26:46.597
I'll bet.
Uh-huh.

26:46.599 --> 26:49.600
The skirt is torn,
has blood on it.

26:49.602 --> 26:52.603
So much for Darren's
claim of consensual sex.

26:52.605 --> 26:53.737
What happened
when it was presented

26:53.739 --> 26:55.339
at the school's
disciplinary panel?

26:55.341 --> 26:58.475
It wasn't-- the panel ruled
that it wasn't relevant.

26:58.477 --> 27:00.344
Oh.

27:00.346 --> 27:02.079
Your tuition dollars at work.

27:02.081 --> 27:03.614
Yeah.

27:03.616 --> 27:05.182
I'm gonna nail this kid.

27:05.184 --> 27:07.985
I got to tell you, Erin.

27:07.987 --> 27:09.987
The skirt is helpful.

27:09.989 --> 27:11.922
But after all this time,

27:11.924 --> 27:14.858
with no police report,
no medical evidence...

27:14.860 --> 27:16.860
I am not letting Darren get
away with raping Hannah.

27:16.862 --> 27:18.462
What he did to that girl is...

27:18.464 --> 27:20.197
Is horrific. I get it.

27:20.199 --> 27:22.032
But step back for a second.

27:22.034 --> 27:25.035
Pretend you don't know
Hannah or her mom.

27:25.037 --> 27:27.571
Given only the facts
of this case

27:27.573 --> 27:29.840
and the reality
of getting convictions

27:29.842 --> 27:33.477
in sexual assault cases
like this...

27:33.479 --> 27:37.180
would you take this to trial?

27:40.552 --> 27:42.719
No.

27:44.189 --> 27:47.257
I'm really sorry.

27:50.129 --> 27:51.728
I'm just sorry for Hannah.

27:51.730 --> 27:54.531
She went through hell
and she won't get justice.

27:54.533 --> 27:56.600
I know.

28:00.072 --> 28:01.772
Unless...

28:01.774 --> 28:03.807
Unless what?

28:05.210 --> 28:08.812
There may be a way to hold
someone responsible.

28:08.814 --> 28:10.347
I would need your okay.

28:10.349 --> 28:12.482
I'm listening.

28:13.619 --> 28:15.085
Morning.
Hey.

28:15.087 --> 28:16.486
Where's Javier?

28:16.488 --> 28:18.722
He's, uh, in a fleabag motel
in Hell's Kitchen.

28:18.724 --> 28:20.924
He'll be boarding a bus
to Scranton in an hour.

28:20.926 --> 28:23.493
I'd rather be on a bus than
getting reamed by the boss.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.162
You think she'll suspend us?

28:25.164 --> 28:26.129
I don't know.

28:26.131 --> 28:27.531
Either way,
we did the right thing.

28:27.533 --> 28:29.132
We still violated
a direct order.

28:29.134 --> 28:30.300
Yeah.

28:30.302 --> 28:33.070
We did. And I apologize
for dragging you into it.

28:33.072 --> 28:35.505
You didn't. We both promised
Javier witness protection.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.374
Yeah, but I'm the one
that held onto him

28:37.376 --> 28:38.976
after Carver said
to cut him loose.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.644
So, when we go into her office
to get chewed out...

28:40.646 --> 28:41.712
Stop it, Danny.

28:41.714 --> 28:43.847
Look, I'm a big girl.

28:43.849 --> 28:45.282
I got my own gold
shield and everything.

28:45.284 --> 28:48.385
I wanted to protect Javier
because my word means

28:48.387 --> 28:50.854
as much to me as yours
does to you, you got it?

28:50.856 --> 28:52.022
Yeah.
We work together.

28:52.024 --> 28:53.123
We catch hell together.

28:53.125 --> 28:54.391
Well, let's prepare
to catch some hell.

28:54.393 --> 28:56.426
ANDRE:
Detectives?

28:57.229 --> 28:58.996
This guy doesn't stop.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.330
You know,
you're like something

29:00.332 --> 29:02.032
we stepped in, Andre.

29:02.034 --> 29:03.967
What part of no
do you not understand?

29:03.969 --> 29:06.837
Look, I get your reluctance
to talk to the press.

29:06.839 --> 29:09.873
But this is an example of law
enforcement getting it right.

29:09.875 --> 29:12.142
The public has a right to know
what happened in this Vega case.

29:12.144 --> 29:13.577
Look, Andre,
we told you before...

29:13.579 --> 29:15.445
You know what?
Maybe Andre's right.

29:16.281 --> 29:17.214
Say what?

29:17.216 --> 29:18.849
Maybe the public
does need to know

29:18.851 --> 29:20.217
what happened in this case.

29:20.219 --> 29:21.251
I mean,

29:21.253 --> 29:23.253
every single detail.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.490
Wouldn't it be interesting
if they found those out?

29:26.492 --> 29:27.924
Andre, we'll be in touch.

29:27.926 --> 29:30.193
Maybe you get your story
after all. Come on.

29:30.195 --> 29:31.962
Where we going?
Not upstairs.

29:31.964 --> 29:33.463
We're gonna go back
and stop Javier

29:33.465 --> 29:34.931
before he gets on that bus
and then we're gonna

29:34.933 --> 29:36.333
pay a visit to the
Marshal Service.

29:36.335 --> 29:38.435
What about the lieutenant?
What about her?

29:38.437 --> 29:39.669
We're going down in flames,

29:39.671 --> 29:42.606
we might as well finish
what we started.

29:54.086 --> 29:56.086
Ms. Jones?

29:56.088 --> 29:58.588
Frank Reagan.

29:59.625 --> 30:01.258
I already told the police

30:01.260 --> 30:03.827
I didn't see anything.

30:03.829 --> 30:06.696
Excuse me.

30:16.442 --> 30:20.677
See, I took a look at the video
on Officer Taylor's body-cam.

30:20.679 --> 30:23.713
And it appears
to show you

30:23.715 --> 30:25.982
recording the arrest
on your cell phone.

30:25.984 --> 30:28.418
Like I said to them,
I wasn't recording.

30:28.420 --> 30:29.920
I was talking
on speakerphone.

30:29.922 --> 30:33.323
But, having a clear view,
can you tell me what you saw?

30:33.325 --> 30:35.892
Not from my perspective,
it wasn't clear.

30:38.730 --> 30:41.364
NYPD isn't very popular
in this neighborhood.

30:41.366 --> 30:44.067
I'd say that's
an understatement.

30:44.870 --> 30:47.471
I take it,
you share that opinion.

30:51.343 --> 30:54.744
I've got four boys,
Commissioner.

30:54.746 --> 30:56.546
Not one of them's
ever been arrested.

30:56.548 --> 31:00.517
Well, you should be
very proud of that.

31:00.519 --> 31:04.955
In this neighborhood,
you know I am.

31:06.925 --> 31:10.594
My oldest son, Ray, just
graduated from City College.

31:10.596 --> 31:12.829
Been stopped by your officers
over 20 times.

31:12.831 --> 31:13.797
My other boys, too.

31:13.799 --> 31:16.433
Questioned,
patted down.

31:16.435 --> 31:18.101
Humiliated.

31:18.103 --> 31:19.769
Never arrested.

31:22.608 --> 31:25.142
I'm sorry your sons had
to go through that.

31:25.144 --> 31:28.512
It's tough enough
to raise your children here,

31:28.514 --> 31:30.313
to teach them self-respect,

31:30.315 --> 31:32.649
without them being
falsely accused

31:32.651 --> 31:35.385
every time they walk
down the street.

31:35.387 --> 31:39.523
You know, you're the second
mother I heard that from today.

31:40.893 --> 31:42.359
The other mother,

31:42.361 --> 31:45.829
she raised her son,
oh, 20 blocks from here.

31:45.831 --> 31:47.831
Walked him back
and forth to school,

31:47.833 --> 31:50.267
kept him away from gangs,
made him study.

31:50.269 --> 31:51.968
Well, so?
What am I supposed to say?

31:51.970 --> 31:52.970
Good for her?

31:52.971 --> 31:57.240
Well, her boy grew up
to be a cop.

31:59.044 --> 32:01.011
The cop in this incident.

32:01.013 --> 32:02.679
Reggie Taylor.

32:03.515 --> 32:06.016
Oh.

32:06.018 --> 32:09.753
She told me that...

32:09.755 --> 32:12.889
he shouldn't be accused
of something he didn't do.

32:16.028 --> 32:21.097
As I'm sure you told
your boys many times.

32:24.670 --> 32:27.003
I'm sorry you didn't record it.

32:27.005 --> 32:30.073
Might go a long way toward
making things better here.

32:30.075 --> 32:31.875
For all of us.

32:34.713 --> 32:36.880
Commissioner Reagan?

32:40.719 --> 32:43.954
Can I ask you a favor?

32:45.791 --> 32:47.691
Sure.

32:50.562 --> 32:52.095
It's my only phone.

32:52.097 --> 32:54.464
We don't have a house phone,

32:54.466 --> 32:58.468
so can you not take it
and just...

32:58.470 --> 33:01.638
tell me where to send the video?

33:03.242 --> 33:05.442
Thank you, Desiree.

33:23.510 --> 33:26.010
MORGAN: <i> You're like a damn dog</i>
<i>with a bone, Reagan.</i>

33:26.012 --> 33:28.212
Look, Javier goes
back into WITSEC,

33:28.214 --> 33:30.181
or the story of how the
feds put a key witness

33:30.183 --> 33:32.650
back on the street with
a price on his head is

33:32.652 --> 33:34.585
on the front
page tomorrow.

33:34.587 --> 33:36.454
Now, the reporter's waiting for
my call, so what's it gonna be?

33:36.456 --> 33:38.990
It's not gonna make
you guys look real good.

33:38.992 --> 33:40.057
Nope.

33:40.059 --> 33:42.126
(laughs)

33:43.429 --> 33:44.662
Are you guys serious?

33:44.664 --> 33:46.631
We're the federal government.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.566
We get bad press every day.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.901
Yeah? How about you?

33:49.903 --> 33:52.069
Has your name been on the front
page of the papers before?

33:52.071 --> 33:55.206
Do you really think there's
gonna be some public outcry?

33:55.208 --> 33:57.842
Because a convicted felon <i> won't</i>
be moving in next door

33:57.844 --> 33:59.477
to some poor
unsuspecting family?

33:59.479 --> 34:01.546
Look, we made a deal
with this guy.

34:01.548 --> 34:03.281
That's right, we did.
And we're gonna honor it.

34:03.283 --> 34:05.216
You guys just don't
get it, do you?

34:05.218 --> 34:06.384
(cell phone rings)

34:06.386 --> 34:09.487
Nobody gives a damn
about this guy-- but you.

34:10.356 --> 34:12.523
Morgan.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.793
Yes, sir.

34:17.864 --> 34:20.531
With all due respect,
sir, I don't think...

34:25.038 --> 34:27.138
Yes, sir.

34:27.139 --> 34:28.906
I understand.

34:28.908 --> 34:30.074
So?

34:31.344 --> 34:34.679
So, this whole little newspaper
thing's just a tap dance, right?

34:36.783 --> 34:38.114
What are you talking about?

34:38.117 --> 34:40.585
Your chief of detectives
called my boss.

34:40.587 --> 34:42.786
Threatened to pull
all PD detectives

34:42.789 --> 34:46.357
off the task force unless
Rojas gets in the program.

34:47.193 --> 34:48.492
Right.

34:48.494 --> 34:49.627
So Javier's in.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.799
Congratulations.

34:54.801 --> 34:57.468
You just saved a total dirtbag.

34:57.470 --> 35:00.304
Takes one to know one.

35:06.946 --> 35:08.346
You're late.

35:08.348 --> 35:12.350
Uh, we were just getting rid
of Javier Rojas.

35:12.352 --> 35:14.318
Like you told us to.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.120
You were late on that, too.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.522
We screwed up, boss.

35:18.524 --> 35:20.725
And then some.

35:23.496 --> 35:26.063
We know you called
the chief of Ds.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.367
It was a very stand-up
thing to do.

35:29.369 --> 35:31.702
I didn't do it for you.
Oh.

35:31.704 --> 35:35.339
If the deals my detectives make
with informants aren't honored,

35:35.341 --> 35:37.074
this squad is out of business.

35:37.076 --> 35:38.376
Absolutely.

35:38.378 --> 35:40.344
That's because
a squad runs on trust.

35:40.346 --> 35:43.948
both out on the street
and in this house.

35:43.950 --> 35:47.818
Now, I know you two thought
you were doing the right thing,

35:47.820 --> 35:51.355
but you violated that trust
in a big way.

35:51.357 --> 35:55.092
We didn't mean
to disrespect you, Lieutenant.

35:55.094 --> 35:56.827
But you did disrespect me.

35:56.829 --> 35:59.830
And the rest
of this squad.

35:59.832 --> 36:01.666
Are we suspended?

36:01.668 --> 36:03.968
I'm not a big fan
of airing dirty laundry,

36:03.970 --> 36:05.703
so I decided
to handle this in-house.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.508
Meaning?

36:10.510 --> 36:15.946
The two of you will choose last
on tours and vacation schedules

36:15.948 --> 36:19.483
for the next
six months.

36:19.485 --> 36:20.985
During which time
you will make sure

36:20.987 --> 36:25.623
that all squad vehicles
are gassed and washed.

36:25.625 --> 36:27.792
Understood?

36:27.794 --> 36:30.394
Yes.

36:31.597 --> 36:33.597
Yeah.

36:33.599 --> 36:35.232
You're both
damn good detectives,

36:35.234 --> 36:38.669
but if you disobey
another direct order,

36:38.671 --> 36:41.205
you're both gone.

36:45.678 --> 36:47.578
Get out.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.953
Hey! What's
the problem?

36:55.955 --> 36:57.221
We don't need
no cops, okay?

36:57.223 --> 36:58.389
This is
a private matter.

36:58.391 --> 36:59.957
You're being loud and boisterous
What?!

36:59.959 --> 37:01.625
Lower your volume down...
I didn't do a damn thing.

37:01.627 --> 37:03.507
I didn't do a damn thing!
Lower your voice down.

37:11.537 --> 37:13.437
As you just saw,

37:13.439 --> 37:16.507
James Prince attacked Officer
Taylor without provocation.

37:16.509 --> 37:18.943
Mr. Prince has been
placed under arrest

37:18.945 --> 37:20.911
and is awaiting a
bedside arraignment

37:20.913 --> 37:22.646
for assaulting
a police officer.

37:22.648 --> 37:25.683
Officer Taylor acted
in self-defense

37:25.685 --> 37:28.786
in the performance of his duty,
and will not be disciplined.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.188
Thank you.

37:34.026 --> 37:35.626
Thank you, Sergeant.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.529
As a special assistant
to the commissioner,

37:38.531 --> 37:42.266
Sergeant Gormley is a welcome
addition to the 14th floor.

37:42.268 --> 37:45.970
The footage you just
saw was provided to us

37:45.972 --> 37:47.972
by a citizen
from the neighborhood

37:47.974 --> 37:49.974
where the incident took place.

37:49.976 --> 37:53.110
It will be used
as supporting evidence

37:53.112 --> 37:57.281
to the witness' testimony
in the trial of Mr. Prince

37:57.283 --> 37:59.283
for his assault
on Officer Taylor.

37:59.285 --> 38:00.351
Questions?

38:00.353 --> 38:01.786
(clamoring)
Commissioner Reagan...

38:01.788 --> 38:03.287
Okay.

38:03.289 --> 38:05.289
Sergeant Gormley...

38:07.160 --> 38:09.693
...is the NYPD in favor

38:09.695 --> 38:11.929
of body-worn cameras
for its officers?

38:18.171 --> 38:20.237
Sergeant?

38:26.712 --> 38:29.046
I, um...

38:31.150 --> 38:32.917
Uh, what was the question?

38:32.919 --> 38:34.985
Is the NYPD in favor

38:34.987 --> 38:37.588
of body-worn cameras
for its officers?

38:40.393 --> 38:44.662
Suffice to say
that in this incident...

38:44.664 --> 38:49.967
it was a camera that started
this whole brouhaha.

38:49.969 --> 38:55.639
And, uh, another camera
that solved the can of worms

38:55.641 --> 39:00.511
of what happened when
the first camera conked out.

39:10.356 --> 39:12.189
Okay, great, now
if we could move on

39:12.191 --> 39:14.925
to item number three
on the agenda.

39:16.429 --> 39:17.895
Sorry to interrupt.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.097
We're here to execute
an arrest warrant.

39:20.099 --> 39:22.600
If you intend
to arrest Darren Bentley,

39:22.602 --> 39:25.502
you can probably find him at
his dorm or on the soccer field.

39:25.504 --> 39:27.104
Yeah, I'd love to,
but your reckless mishandling

39:27.106 --> 39:31.475
of Hannah Lancaster's rape
complaint made that impossible.

39:31.477 --> 39:33.277
I'm sorry you feel that way.

39:33.279 --> 39:34.645
Now, if you'll excuse us.

39:34.647 --> 39:36.914
There's no excuse
for what happened here.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.983
And I may not be able
to charge Darren Bentley,

39:38.985 --> 39:40.951
but I can do
the next best thing.

39:40.953 --> 39:42.519
What's this?

39:42.521 --> 39:45.723
Dean Walters, we have
a warrant for your arrest

39:45.725 --> 39:47.024
for hindering prosecution.
Please stand up.

39:47.026 --> 39:49.026
You've got
to be kidding.

39:49.028 --> 39:50.961
You're arresting me?

39:50.963 --> 39:54.632
You withheld crucial evidence
in violation of a subpoena.

39:54.634 --> 39:56.066
That was an oversight.

39:57.536 --> 39:58.769
This is outrageous.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.604
You'll never convict her
for hindering prosecution

40:00.606 --> 40:01.772
or anything else.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.040
Maybe not.

40:03.042 --> 40:05.442
But when this goes to trial
and hits the newspapers,

40:05.444 --> 40:09.813
the public will know what passes
for justice on this campus.
