00:01.293 --> 00:02.586
Previously
on When Calls The Heart...

00:02.628 --> 00:04.045
[Elizabeth] How's Becky?

00:04.087 --> 00:05.589
[Dr. Burns] The fever broke,
but her pulse is weak.

00:05.631 --> 00:06.966
I'm going to need to bring her
back with me to Union City.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.425
The sooner I get her there,
the sooner she'll recover.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.051
Peter, I'm not
going with you.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.095
If you don't get on this coach,
our engagement is over.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.054
This is part
of the broken cable

00:13.096 --> 00:14.473
that cut your foot,

00:14.515 --> 00:16.016
and that didn't break
because of wear and tear.

00:16.057 --> 00:16.934
Something's not right here.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.602
Sabotage.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.061
Here you go.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.730
That's a list
of every employee

00:21.772 --> 00:22.815
who's ever had
a job with me.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.942
Anyone with
a score to settle?

00:24.984 --> 00:26.109
Not that
I can think of.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.069
I haven't fired anybody
since we've been open.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.571
We need to keep
this investigation

00:29.613 --> 00:30.489
quiet for now.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.699
We don't want
to tip our hand.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.702
I think I'll have
a few casual conversations

00:34.743 --> 00:36.077
and see what I can find out.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.287
Well, if it is really sabotage,

00:37.329 --> 00:38.706
we need to put an end to it,
and fast.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.081
We will.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.249
I mean, I hate cutting
back on shifts,

00:41.291 --> 00:42.626
but I really have no choice.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.086
We're so far behind schedule,
and now...

00:45.128 --> 00:46.588
we're losing contracts.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.883
Whoever's behind this, Lee,
is going to make a mistake.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.385
They always do.

00:52.845 --> 00:53.971
Thanks, guys.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.351
[Elizabeth]
I saw Florence this morning.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.353
She said there might not be
a service at church this week.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.480
Well, it depends
on when Frank gets back.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.107
He's in Buxton,
testifying in the Garrison case.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.401
I'll be so glad

01:07.442 --> 01:08.402
when I don't have
to hear that name ever again.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.070
Me too.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.655
Miss Abigail!
She's coming!

01:11.697 --> 01:12.740
Becky's coming!

01:12.781 --> 01:13.824
She says
she's getting better,

01:13.866 --> 01:16.326
and the hospital
is going to release her.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.494
That's
wonderful news.

01:17.536 --> 01:18.746
Does it say when
she'll be back?

01:18.787 --> 01:20.664
[Abigail] No, but this was
mailed last week.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.041
So it'll be soon, right?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.043
I will wire Dr. Burns
and find out.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.961
Then we can all be together.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.713
Yes.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.297
We can all be together.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.591
[laughs]

01:30.632 --> 01:32.009
[Jack]
Whoa...

01:33.176 --> 01:35.094
[Clem] Oh,
morning, Constable.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.137
Oh, morning!

01:36.179 --> 01:37.848
You're a lucky man

01:37.890 --> 01:39.098
to wake up to this
every day.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.060
That's what's going
to make it hard to leave.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.477
You still thinking
about selling?

01:42.519 --> 01:43.896
Yeah, yeah.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.230
I'm going to move back east,

01:45.272 --> 01:47.608
live with my daughter
and grandkids.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.235
How much you asking?

01:50.277 --> 01:51.486
I don't know
for sure.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.155
Depends on who buys it.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.157
If it's a young man
like yourself,

01:56.199 --> 01:58.786
who's looking
to build a house

01:58.827 --> 02:00.788
for your new family,

02:00.829 --> 02:02.081
I'll give you a good price.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.249
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.168
I've already got someone
eyeballing the place,

02:07.210 --> 02:10.380
so if you're interested,
don't take too long.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.174
To buy the house...
or start the family?

02:13.216 --> 02:15.094
[laughs]
Yeah!

02:16.428 --> 02:17.429
Good day.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.810
[♪♪♪]

02:42.245 --> 02:44.289
[Elizabeth] I always thought
it would be easy to be a writer.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.207
There's so much
to inspire me here,

02:46.249 --> 02:50.295
so many stories and characters
that I want to share,

02:50.337 --> 02:52.547
but it turns out
it's much easier

02:52.589 --> 02:54.758
to think of yourself as a writer

02:54.800 --> 02:57.761
than it is
to sit down and write.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.560
Need a ride, Miss?

03:05.602 --> 03:07.228
Miss? [laughs]

03:07.270 --> 03:08.355
Actually, no,
I'm not in the habit

03:08.396 --> 03:09.731
of accepting offers
from strangers.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.232
I'm a Mountie.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.567
You have to trust me.
It's the law.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.902
Well, if it's the law...

03:15.278 --> 03:16.237
About dinner tonight...

03:16.279 --> 03:17.280
I'm not really sure

03:17.322 --> 03:18.866
I'm going to be back
in time.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.159
Since Frank
is out of town,

03:20.199 --> 03:21.284
I'm going to be going with Faith
to the settlement

03:21.326 --> 03:23.162
to deliver
some medical supplies.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.874
Well, maybe she has something
for your memory.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.416
What's wrong with my memory?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.127
You forgot to mention

03:30.169 --> 03:31.210
that she's staying
to run the infirmary

03:31.252 --> 03:33.130
and she broke off
her engagement.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.090
Did I forget that?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.718
You know,
it really doesn't bother me

03:37.759 --> 03:39.260
that she's staying.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.180
Faith is a really good nurse,
and we need her.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.807
I'm glad to hear you say that.

03:43.849 --> 03:44.892
Come on.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.149
When's Becky coming?

03:52.191 --> 03:55.027
Dr. Burns told Miss
Abigail it'll be soon,

03:55.069 --> 03:56.862
maybe even tomorrow.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.321
I wish
I had a big sister.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.406
Then you can have mine.

04:00.866 --> 04:01.825
Thank you.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.077
You're welcome.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.286
What's that,
Miss Thatcher?

04:05.328 --> 04:08.832
This... is...

04:08.874 --> 04:09.833
a volcano!

04:09.875 --> 04:13.087
And it's also an
example of a project

04:13.128 --> 04:14.546
for the Science Fair.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.215
We're going
to have a Science Fair?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.298
Not just us.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.093
Schools all across the west

04:19.134 --> 04:20.301
will be putting on
science fairs,

04:20.343 --> 04:22.679
and a judge from
the Polytechnic Institute

04:22.721 --> 04:23.805
in Cape Fullerton

04:23.847 --> 04:26.516
will be choosing
the top five students

04:26.558 --> 04:28.351
to compete for a scholarship.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.771
I'm too young
to go away to school.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.898
But you're not too young
to build a science project,

04:32.940 --> 04:36.276
and the most important
part is to have fun.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.318
It doesn't seem
very fun to me.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.238
Well, watch this.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.078
[kids gasp, laugh]

04:47.370 --> 04:48.205
Ooh...

04:48.247 --> 04:50.207
Whoa! Wow.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.583
So?
Are we having fun yet?

04:52.667 --> 04:53.543
Yeah.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.299
So how are things
at the infirmary?

04:59.340 --> 05:00.968
Busy...

05:01.009 --> 05:02.844
but I'm not
complaining.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.346
It keeps me from
feeling lonesome.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.515
Well, you do have
friends here, you know.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.767
I know.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.938
You miss Peter.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.355
It's hard to let go.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.733
Are you having second thoughts?

05:16.775 --> 05:17.442
No.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.694
He wasn't
a bad person.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.404
We just wanted
different things.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.990
So you're happy here?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.574
Happy...

05:24.616 --> 05:26.409
but also a little scared.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.745
Being in charge
of an infirmary...

05:28.787 --> 05:29.955
it's a lot.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.124
I've never done anything
like this before.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.960
Well,
you're a strong woman,

05:35.002 --> 05:36.377
and you have the talent.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.378
[laughs]

05:37.420 --> 05:38.797
You're more sure
of that than I am.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.050
Well, that's because
I've seen you in action.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.430
[Florence]
Mr. Coulter!

05:47.472 --> 05:49.390
Yes?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.475
I hope I'm not
being too nosy,

05:50.517 --> 05:51.518
but I'd like to ask
you a question.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.395
You? Nosy?
Never.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.730
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Blakely?

05:55.772 --> 05:58.399
I've noticed that
some of your men

05:58.441 --> 06:00.401
seem to have some extra
time on their hands.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.946
Is there a problem
at the mill?

06:02.988 --> 06:04.489
No! No, no, no,

06:04.531 --> 06:06.783
just, uh, routine maintenance,
that's all.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.410
We'll be up and running
at full capacity

06:09.452 --> 06:10.662
in no time.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.415
Good day.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.625
Good day.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.794
Coffee, please.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.296
[Rosemary]
Lee!

06:19.338 --> 06:20.172
There you are.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.422
I have big news.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.175
I do hope it's
good big news.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.259
It couldn't be better.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.136
The Omnigraph Moving
Picture Company

06:26.178 --> 06:27.512
is coming to Hope Valley.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.430
They're going to shoot
a motion picture right here!

06:29.472 --> 06:30.515
In the saloon?

06:30.557 --> 06:32.976
All over town.
Isn't it thrilling?

06:33.018 --> 06:35.354
Yeah, I'm thrilled.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.855
It's called
"The Reluctant Bride,"

06:36.897 --> 06:40.234
and it's starring none other
than Mary Medford herself.

06:42.194 --> 06:43.945
Lee!

06:43.987 --> 06:45.364
Mary Medford.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.823
She's starred
in dozens of movies.

06:46.865 --> 06:47.782
She's very famous.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.825
If you say so.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.035
-I do.
-Okay.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.245
And it gets even better.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.454
The director is Tobias Pope,

06:53.496 --> 06:55.456
and he is going
to be auditioning locals

06:55.498 --> 06:56.457
to play
some of the supporting roles

06:56.499 --> 06:57.709
in the movie.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.170
Ah, and let me guess,
you're going to try out.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.255
Of course I am.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.131
It may just be
a supporting role,

07:03.173 --> 07:06.301
but Lee, this is my chance
to reach an audience

07:06.343 --> 07:08.678
a million times bigger
than just...

07:08.720 --> 07:11.181
some tiny little theatre.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.182
Mm.

07:12.224 --> 07:13.225
Just think of it.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.477
All the world will be my stage!

07:16.519 --> 07:17.729
Ooh!
[laughs]

07:20.399 --> 07:21.942
As if it isn't already.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.282
Here you go.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.199
You don't need
all of those.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.076
I'm telling you
to back off.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.494
Hey, let's take it easy.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.913
Guys, no one's
going to go hungry.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.123
There's plenty of food
to go around

07:36.164 --> 07:37.665
if everyone shares.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.923
Good...

07:44.965 --> 07:45.966
All finished.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.760
You'll have to change
the bandage every day.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.804
You don't want
an infection.

07:56.017 --> 07:56.893
Edith!

07:58.561 --> 08:00.230
How's Oliver?

08:00.272 --> 08:01.648
Taking a nap right now.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.233
It gives me a chance
to take care of a few things.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.525
You look tired.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.568
Maybe you should rest too.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.155
After I get the wash done,
and cook dinner.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.240
Ready to head out?

08:10.282 --> 08:11.574
Almost.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.576
There's a cradle
in the back of the wagon.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.203
I'd like Edith
to have it for her baby.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.247
I think that can be arranged.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.206
Let me.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.207
Thank you.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.128
Here we go.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.967
Oh, actually,
it's pretty heavy.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.551
Your husband around here
to give you a hand?

08:30.593 --> 08:32.804
I'm afraid he's gone.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.556
I didn't know.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.642
Oh, it's not like that.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.560
Roy left a while ago,

08:39.602 --> 08:40.728
before he knew
I was with child.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.356
Have you told him
about Oliver?

08:43.315 --> 08:44.691
No.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.817
I haven't heard from him
since the night he walked out.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.861
Do you think
that he should know?

08:47.902 --> 08:50.197
Even if he did,
he wouldn't care anyway.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.036
Well, let me give you
a hand with this.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.912
Thank you.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.164
This way.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.219
Well, looks like one
of your tent posts is broken.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.139
Canvas is torn, too.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.598
It's nothing, really.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.684
Bad weather's coming.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.977
I'll bring some tools
next time I come out

09:21.019 --> 09:22.187
and fix it.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.604
I wouldn't want you
to go to any trouble.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.358
It's no trouble at all.
Happy to help.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.361
[Clara]
How'd the trial go?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.405
It's not over yet.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.572
I gave my testimony
yesterday,

09:32.613 --> 09:34.949
but Frank still has
to testify tomorrow.

09:34.991 --> 09:35.909
My guess is,

09:35.950 --> 09:37.160
the Garrison boys'll
be going away

09:37.202 --> 09:38.953
for a long time.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.205
I'm really glad

09:40.247 --> 09:41.622
that you decided
to do the right thing, Jesse.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.125
You saved Pastor Hogan's life.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.503
You're a hero.

09:46.545 --> 09:47.546
I'm not so sure

09:47.587 --> 09:48.629
I like being called
a hero for it.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.631
You'll get used to it.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.050
You know...

09:52.092 --> 09:53.634
I was talking to some
of the boys at the mill,

09:53.676 --> 09:56.346
and they said
there's a barn dance coming up.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.847
You wouldn't happen to know
anyone who might like to go,

09:57.889 --> 09:58.639
would you?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.934
You know...

10:00.975 --> 10:03.061
I think Florence Blakeley
loves to dance.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.106
I'm sure she does.
I bet she's pretty good, too.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.067
No one does a quick step
like Florence.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.820
Well, just in case
she turns me down,

10:12.862 --> 10:14.822
maybe you could go with me?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.075
Maybe...

10:19.536 --> 10:21.037
[laughs]

10:24.832 --> 10:27.001
I thought you were having
dinner with Jack.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.379
I am... if he
gets back in time.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.671
Where is he?

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
At the settlement...

10:32.715 --> 10:33.758
with Faith.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.343
You know, she's been terrific.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.677
I know.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.596
We're very lucky
to have her.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.389
But...?

10:40.681 --> 10:41.766
I want to like her, Abigail,

10:41.808 --> 10:43.851
and I think
we could be friends,

10:43.893 --> 10:46.396
if I could just trust her
with Jack.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.065
Give it some time.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.025
I think you two
actually have a lot in common.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.360
It isn't easy...

10:52.402 --> 10:53.487
What isn't easy?

10:53.528 --> 10:55.530
Eavesdropping on grownups,
apparently.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.697
Can I go out and play
with Robert?

10:56.739 --> 10:58.074
Do you have homework?

10:58.116 --> 10:59.159
Um...

10:59.200 --> 11:00.243
[door opens]

11:00.285 --> 11:01.702
[Becky]
Cody?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.079
Becky?

11:03.121 --> 11:05.248
Oh! They must have caught
an early stage.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.483
Aren't you glad to see me?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.901
Sure I am.

11:33.943 --> 11:34.902
Are you okay?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.571
I'm fine.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.697
It's just taking a while
to get better, that's all.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.537
I really missed you.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.753
[whispers] Why didn't
you tell me about this?

11:52.795 --> 11:54.172
I was hoping she'd
be out of it by now.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.549
Is it serious?

11:55.590 --> 11:57.217
The truth is, there's
nothing wrong with her legs.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.845
Well, then, why
the wheelchair?

12:00.887 --> 12:04.474
Well,
she's weak from being in bed.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.559
Quite frankly,

12:05.600 --> 12:06.560
she just hasn't
been motivated

12:06.601 --> 12:07.561
to put in enough of an effort.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.770
That's why I brought her here.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.814
She just needs encouragement
and support.

12:11.856 --> 12:12.857
So you're saying
it's emotional?

12:12.899 --> 12:15.776
She has to want to get better.

12:15.818 --> 12:16.777
Love from the people
who care about her

12:16.819 --> 12:17.987
is the best medicine right now.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.781
Well, she will get
plenty of love,

12:20.823 --> 12:22.783
that's for sure.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.578
I know she will.

12:24.619 --> 12:27.914
Mrs. Stanton,
when I was here last,

12:27.955 --> 12:29.790
we spoke about the children
needing a real home.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.043
I remember.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.003
Well,
that need hasn't gone away.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
I was wondering...

12:37.840 --> 12:38.799
have you thought
about taking the children

12:38.841 --> 12:40.009
on a permanent basis?

12:41.844 --> 12:44.805
I have thought
about it every day,

12:44.847 --> 12:46.558
and I know that it
would make Cody happy,

12:46.600 --> 12:47.975
but...

12:48.017 --> 12:51.271
But you're worried about
how Becky might feel about it?

12:51.312 --> 12:54.899
I have to make sure
it will make her happy too.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.651
She's been through so much,

12:56.693 --> 12:58.819
she might not be ready
to make a decision like that.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.906
Well, the sooner she decides,
the better.

13:01.948 --> 13:02.823
The social worker
wants to place them

13:02.865 --> 13:03.991
as soon as possible.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.538
I will talk to her,
and I'll let you know.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.789
All right.

13:10.831 --> 13:11.832
I'll say my goodbyes.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.501
Thank you for everything,
Dr. Burns.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.843
[Elizabeth]
Abigail...

13:22.885 --> 13:24.679
are you sure about this?

13:26.598 --> 13:28.015
So sure.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.355
[Bill] I talked to everyone
on the list you gave us,

13:34.397 --> 13:36.815
and it just doesn't seem
like anyone holds a grudge.

13:36.857 --> 13:37.900
So it's not one of my men?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.360
I didn't say that.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.404
We still think the saboteur
has to be an inside man.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.906
If he's not doing it
for personal reasons,

13:43.948 --> 13:46.409
then someone's paying him.

13:46.451 --> 13:47.494
The question is,

13:47.535 --> 13:49.496
who would pay to put
you out of business?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.706
Henry Gowen, for one.

13:51.748 --> 13:52.873
Tried to take the sawmill
away from me last year.

13:52.915 --> 13:53.874
Yeah, I heard
about that,

13:53.916 --> 13:54.875
in a poker game,

13:54.917 --> 13:56.085
but you won.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.878
Poker was only part of it.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.340
With all the fees and taxes
he's slapped on me,

14:00.381 --> 14:01.882
it's a miracle I've been able
to stay in business.

14:01.924 --> 14:02.717
Death by a
thousand cuts.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.135
Yeah...

14:04.177 --> 14:07.681
Well, looks like he thinks
I'm not dying fast enough.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.433
Based on past history,
Gowen is suspect number one.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.144
But he's not the
only possibility.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.228
You think
you could put

14:14.270 --> 14:15.062
a list of your
competitors together?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.439
We'll check them out.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.274
Sure, uh... it's not going
to be a very long list.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.693
Uh...

14:19.734 --> 14:20.985
Tommy Northridge picked up
one of my contracts.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.903
He also lent me
a couple wagons

14:22.945 --> 14:24.905
so I wouldn't lose
any other ones.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.783
He seems like
a stand-up guy to me.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.951
Yeah, we'll talk to him anyway.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.831
I didn't know
you were a writer.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.832
I'm not.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.291
I like to draw.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.125
May I see?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.084
Yeah.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.468
Where did you learn
to do all this?

14:45.510 --> 14:46.636
My dad.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.304
Was he an engineer?

14:48.346 --> 14:50.014
He worked on
the Queensland Bridge.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.558
I was building
a model of it,

14:51.599 --> 14:53.142
but I never got to finish.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.561
And your father taught you
all of this?

14:54.602 --> 14:55.520
Most of it.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.065
I have a great idea.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.484
Why don't you
design a bridge

15:01.526 --> 15:02.360
for the Science Fair?

15:02.402 --> 15:03.778
Then you could build the model

15:03.820 --> 15:05.112
that you and your father
never had a chance to finish.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.698
You really think I could?

15:06.740 --> 15:07.948
With your talent,

15:07.990 --> 15:08.949
you might even
win the scholarship.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.910
I'm not really that good.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.496
Believe me.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.914
You are that good.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.458
It's getting
cold out.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.628
Why don't we go inside
and make some hot chocolate?

15:20.670 --> 15:21.629
I love hot chocolate.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.797
Me too.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.551
Would you like
to try to walk inside?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.428
I don't know...

15:28.469 --> 15:30.096
I'll be right here.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.347
I won't let you fall.

15:34.016 --> 15:34.975
Maybe tomorrow?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.728
Tomorrow it is.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.109
It's all done.
Should hold for a while.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.361
Thank you so much.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.154
I was a little worried
the whole thing might fall down.

15:47.196 --> 15:51.409
Well, you need anything else,
you just let me know.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.577
Thanks.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.121
Roy used to be handy
at chores like that.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.623
He could fix almost anything.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.957
Is he a carpenter?

15:57.998 --> 15:58.999
No, a miner.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.460
Miner?
He work around here?

16:00.501 --> 16:02.837
A friend said he got a job
at the Silverton Mine,

16:02.879 --> 16:04.631
but I don't know for sure.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.716
You got a picture
in your locket?

16:06.758 --> 16:07.759
May I?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.011
Next to Oliver's.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.513
Lord knows
we had our differences,

16:12.555 --> 16:16.142
but Roy's the only man
I've ever loved,

16:16.183 --> 16:18.060
and he'll always be
Oliver's father.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.064
Edith, can I ask...

16:22.106 --> 16:23.274
did Roy ever mistreat you?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.651
No.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.026
It wasn't like that.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.612
He just...

16:27.654 --> 16:31.699
he just didn't take to the idea
of being a husband too well,

16:31.741 --> 16:32.992
but it's all right.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.160
Oliver and I manage just fine.

16:37.872 --> 16:38.832
Whoa!

16:38.873 --> 16:40.458
You just need
to straighten it out

16:40.500 --> 16:41.542
a little.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.005
There! Perfect.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.048
That should do it.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.425
Well, it's a good thing

16:49.467 --> 16:51.469
you have so many things
that need fixing around here.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.054
Might have lots of
free time on my hands

16:54.096 --> 16:55.890
if the sawmill shuts down.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.350
Well, that's not actually
going to happen, is it?

16:57.391 --> 16:59.059
Well, I hope not.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.061
[knocking on door,
door opens]

17:01.103 --> 17:02.897
Afternoon!

17:04.106 --> 17:06.066
I, uh, hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.068
No, Wade was just helping me
fix the step.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.030
Always good to see
neighbors helping neighbors.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.491
Let me know if I can help you
with anything else.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.367
Oh, thank you.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.035
I'm right next door.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.036
Constable.

17:17.077 --> 17:17.954
Wade.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.248
[door opens and shuts]

17:23.125 --> 17:24.084
What?

17:24.126 --> 17:25.879
He's very... helpful.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.422
And very worried
for his job.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.757
What's going on with the mill?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.091
Well, I can't really say.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.677
Can't, or won't?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.679
It's confidential
at this stage.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.181
Then let's talk
about something else.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.850
Like?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.727
Like your trip
to the settlement.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.395
How did it go?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.104
Not so good.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.147
You remember
the woman with the baby?

17:45.189 --> 17:47.066
The one Faith was helping?

17:47.107 --> 17:48.317
Edith.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.195
Her husband left her,
before the baby was born.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.238
It's been really hard on her.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.073
Do you know what happened?

17:55.033 --> 17:55.867
No...

17:55.909 --> 17:57.076
But you're going to find out.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.246
Should I be worried
you're starting to read my mind?

18:02.164 --> 18:03.123
Maybe a little.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.755
Well, can you tell
what I'm thinking right now?

18:09.630 --> 18:10.715
I hope so.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.721
[Abigail] You haven't said
a word all afternoon.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.931
I'm sorry.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.515
Sometimes I just get lost
in what I'm doing.

18:19.557 --> 18:20.850
Oh, don't be sorry.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.018
Miss Thatcher says

18:22.060 --> 18:24.144
you have
a very special talent.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.648
Doing stuff like this
makes me feel close to my dad.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.442
Did you used
to do this together?

18:29.483 --> 18:31.110
When he had the time.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.154
Becky...

18:34.196 --> 18:36.156
I know
that no one could ever replace

18:36.198 --> 18:38.158
your mother or your father,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.995
but Dr. Burns was talking
about finding a real home

18:41.037 --> 18:42.329
for you and Cody.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.334
I'd like to
stay here, but...

18:47.376 --> 18:48.086
But what?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.754
Would you even want me?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.091
Why would you say that?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.509
Look at me.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.510
I can't even walk.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.720
The doctor says

18:57.762 --> 18:59.055
you'll be out of that wheelchair
in no time.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.180
What if I'm not?

19:00.222 --> 19:03.810
It still wouldn't matter,
not to me.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.813
I know
that you'd like Cody to stay.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.566
Not just Cody.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.193
Becky, when you were sick,

19:13.235 --> 19:14.361
and I thought something
might happen to you,

19:14.403 --> 19:17.156
I felt like I was
losing my own daughter.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.742
I don't know
if I can explain it,

19:19.784 --> 19:21.535
but from the moment

19:21.577 --> 19:22.703
you and your brother
came into my life,

19:22.745 --> 19:25.957
I knew that we were meant
to be together...

19:25.999 --> 19:27.792
all three of us.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.002
You really mean that?

19:29.043 --> 19:32.212
Yes.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.007
You're in my heart,

19:34.048 --> 19:35.549
and that's where families
are born.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.013
Does that mean
we're going to be a family?

19:40.054 --> 19:42.222
That's exactly
what it means.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.599
[laughs]

19:52.025 --> 19:53.317
-Shot one, establish--
-Mr. Pope?

19:56.278 --> 19:57.237
Who wants to know?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.406
Rosemary LeVeaux.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.241
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sure you know my work.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.242
Can't say I do.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.495
Joan of Arc
in "Joan of Arc?"

20:04.537 --> 20:07.165
Major Barbara
in "Major Barbara,"

20:07.206 --> 20:08.248
and the grieving widow in...

20:08.290 --> 20:10.043
Let me guess.
"The Grieving Widow?"

20:10.084 --> 20:12.045
I've played the lead
in dozens of plays,

20:12.086 --> 20:13.546
and I just happen
to be available

20:13.587 --> 20:15.048
for your moving picture.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.590
Well,
Mary Medford needs a maid.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.384
That's perfect.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.594
I played the chambermaid
in "The Chambermaid."

20:20.636 --> 20:21.637
Not on screen.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.222
At the hotel,
when she gets here.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.265
But I'm an actress.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.394
All the roles have been cast.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.025
Hickam?

20:36.861 --> 20:38.571
Is that a script?

20:38.612 --> 20:40.031
Yes, ma'am.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.323
Mr. Coulter
cut back on my hours,

20:41.365 --> 20:43.242
so I figure I have
some more time on my hands.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.287
Mr. Pope cast you?
In the movie?

20:47.329 --> 20:49.082
Yep,

20:49.123 --> 20:51.291
and Mary Dunbar
is playing my girlfriend.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.002
Mary's in the movie too?

20:53.044 --> 20:54.503
So's Molly Sullivan.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.384
Good ol' Molly Sullivan.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.555
Well, this is quite
an operation you have here,

21:04.597 --> 21:05.223
Mister Northridge.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.933
Yeah,
I get by.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.392
Lee Coulter mentioned to us

21:08.434 --> 21:10.728
that you loaned him a couple
of your delivery wagons.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.813
Well, Coulter's helped me
out of a jam or two before.

21:12.855 --> 21:13.731
You know,
figure I owe him.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.024
We go way back.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.316
Have you heard
about the accidents at his mill?

21:16.358 --> 21:18.444
Yeah...
Heard they may not be accidents.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.238
You ever have
any dealings

21:20.279 --> 21:21.197
with a man
named Henry Gowen?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.823
Funny you should ask.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.283
Gowen came to me
two months back.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.326
Wanted to team up
to buy Lee out of his sawmill.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.703
I turned him down.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.872
Just didn't strike me as the
type of man I could trust.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.041
You made
a wise choice.

21:32.083 --> 21:32.875
Thank you
for your help.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.293
Any time, gentlemen.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.046
Sounds like Lee's hunch
about Gowen

21:37.088 --> 21:38.131
may be right after all.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.590
We've got to have
some evidence, Jack.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.176
Let Lee know we
talked to Northridge.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.427
I'm going to be back
in a couple hours.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.765
[rings bell]

21:48.933 --> 21:50.143
Miss Thatcher!

21:50.184 --> 21:52.186
Me and Becky are going
to stay with Miss Abigail!

21:52.228 --> 21:53.854
That's wonderful news!

21:53.896 --> 21:55.355
I wired Dr. Burns.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.607
There's still some paperwork
to be filed.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.859
I will say a prayer
that everything goes through.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.194
Can I tell my friends?

22:00.236 --> 22:02.029
I don't see why not.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.114
Becky, would you like

22:03.156 --> 22:04.323
to tell
some of the other girls?

22:04.364 --> 22:06.033
Do you think
they even remember me?

22:06.075 --> 22:07.118
Remember you?

22:07.160 --> 22:08.368
They can't wait
to see you!

22:08.410 --> 22:09.411
I think
Rachel's inside.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.080
Come on.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.665
I can't.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.128
It's okay.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.838
We'll get some
of the bigger boys to help you.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.380
Boys?

22:20.422 --> 22:23.050
Would you mind helping me
with Becky?

22:23.092 --> 22:25.343
Come on, boys.
Thank you so much.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.345
Thanks, gentlemen.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.307
Excuse me?

22:29.347 --> 22:31.349
I'm looking
for Roy Sampson?

22:34.352 --> 22:35.521
Thank you.

22:40.318 --> 22:41.819
Uh, Roy? Got a minute?

22:42.695 --> 22:43.696
Who're you?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.281
I'm a friend of Edith's.

22:45.323 --> 22:46.406
She okay?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.951
She's not sick,
if that's what you mean.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.078
She send you?

22:51.120 --> 22:53.622
No. No, she doesn't
even know I'm here.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.041
I'd like to talk to you
about her.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.374
It's important.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.836
I'm busy right now.

22:58.878 --> 22:59.920
How about we get
a cup of coffee on your break?

22:59.962 --> 23:01.421
I don't have a break
for another hour.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.381
It's okay.
I'll wait.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.135
All right.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.019
Opal...

23:15.061 --> 23:16.394
what's wrong?

23:16.436 --> 23:19.023
I don't know
what to do for my project.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.440
Oh!

23:20.482 --> 23:21.483
Well, maybe
I could help.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.402
Ephraim says science
isn't for girls.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.072
Remember what I said
on our camping trip?

23:26.113 --> 23:27.907
Girls can do
anything boys can do.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.159
That's right.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.869
There are lots of famous
scientists who are women.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.705
Elizabeth Blackwell
was a famous doctor.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.374
Then there's Marie Curie.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.333
Becky!

23:37.375 --> 23:39.835
Emily Roebling
was a field engineer

23:39.877 --> 23:41.087
on the Brooklyn Bridge.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.130
I didn't know
that girls could be engineers.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.506
Well, they can.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.674
You're only limited
by your imagination.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.971
So, tell me something
that you like to do,

23:51.013 --> 23:52.056
something fun.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.724
I like to play with Brownie.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.477
Then why don't you do
your science project on bears?

23:57.519 --> 23:59.479
You can find out
where brown bears live

23:59.521 --> 24:00.689
and what they eat.

24:00.731 --> 24:01.899
Is that really science?

24:01.941 --> 24:02.775
Sure!

24:02.816 --> 24:05.569
It's the science of zoology...

24:07.988 --> 24:09.489
and this is a book

24:09.531 --> 24:12.243
just full of wonderful
facts about bears,

24:12.285 --> 24:14.536
and pictures too.
See?

24:14.578 --> 24:16.080
There's Brownie's cousin!

24:16.122 --> 24:17.290
[gasps]

24:17.331 --> 24:19.375
I'm going to like
science a lot.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.709
Here you go.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.469
I have a son?

24:31.511 --> 24:33.639
His name's Oliver.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.850
I didn't know
Edith was pregnant.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.018
I know you and Edith

24:38.060 --> 24:40.520
didn't always see
eye to eye on everything,

24:40.562 --> 24:41.814
but I think it's time

24:41.855 --> 24:43.023
that the two of you
talk things out.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.692
It won't work.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.278
You won't know
unless you give it a shot.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.197
I made a lousy husband.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.449
Think I'll do better as a dad?

24:51.489 --> 24:54.618
There's only one way
to find out, Roy.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.580
Edith doesn't need me.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.499
I think she needs you
now more than ever.

25:06.464 --> 25:09.175
We gave it a try.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.217
It didn't work.

25:11.469 --> 25:12.636
Look...

25:12.678 --> 25:13.762
it's okay to be scared.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.850
I'm not scared.

25:17.891 --> 25:18.892
Leave it be.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.691
So Gowen went
to Tommy

25:25.732 --> 25:26.650
to try and put me
out of business?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.526
That's what Northridge told me.

25:30.488 --> 25:31.571
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.614
So what's the next move?

25:34.158 --> 25:35.826
You know, Lee...

25:35.868 --> 25:38.745
suddenly I'm in the mood
for a little poker.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.506
You look about
as happy as I feel.

25:48.546 --> 25:50.590
Is it the sawmill?

25:50.632 --> 25:52.885
Aw, it's nothing
I can't handle.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.845
So tell me,
what's got you so down?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.263
[sighs]

25:56.305 --> 25:57.597
It's this director,
Tobias Pope.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.059
He's cast
everyone in town except me

26:00.100 --> 26:01.519
to be in his movie.

26:01.559 --> 26:03.187
Molly Sullivan.
Mary Dunbar.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.189
Even Hickam.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.648
What am I doing wrong?

26:06.690 --> 26:08.608
You're not doing
anything wrong, Rosemary.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.610
It's not your fault

26:10.652 --> 26:12.696
that this Pope character
can't see your talent.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.573
If he could, he would hire you
in a heartbeat.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.660
Yes... he would.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.620
Yeah.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.164
That's it!

26:22.206 --> 26:23.581
What's it?

26:23.623 --> 26:26.668
Leland Coulter, you are
the most clever man I know.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.337
I'd better get started.

26:28.379 --> 26:29.547
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
started on what?

26:29.587 --> 26:30.714
Your plan.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.007
My plan?

26:32.049 --> 26:33.342
It's just genius!

26:33.384 --> 26:34.260
Mwah!

26:37.679 --> 26:39.056
Glad I could help.

27:04.498 --> 27:05.665
It's so good
to see you.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.334
Very nice
to see you too.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.093
[Elizabeth] Becky has made
amazing progress

27:16.135 --> 27:17.595
on her science project.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.221
[Jack] Yeah, but not getting
out of the wheelchair.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.264
I'm not giving up.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.061
It seems like Wade
Barrett's everywhere

27:26.103 --> 27:27.687
these days.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.731
He's a very nice man.

27:29.773 --> 27:33.193
In fact, I'm thinking of basing
a character in my story on him.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.653
Well, every heroine needs
an annoying neighbor.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.823
He isn't annoying.
He's...

27:37.864 --> 27:39.032
solicitous.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.159
Isn't that just a fancy word

27:40.200 --> 27:41.701
that means he gets
on people's nerves?

27:41.743 --> 27:43.370
Jack!

27:43.412 --> 27:45.414
I understand Wade
is very valuable to Lee.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.375
I have to go.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.709
That sounds serious.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.710
Mountie business?

27:50.752 --> 27:54.131
No. It's...

27:54.173 --> 27:55.048
it's private.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.717
I see.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.677
Very mysterious.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.721
Yup, that's me.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.432
Man of mystery.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.278
So what's happening?

28:16.320 --> 28:18.322
Remember I said

28:18.364 --> 28:20.199
there was another fellow
looking at my land?

28:20.240 --> 28:21.408
I do.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.743
Well, he's getting
ready to make an offer.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.454
I just thought you should know.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.624
Mr. Besser, will you excuse me
just one moment?

28:35.713 --> 28:36.756
Now...

28:36.798 --> 28:38.217
you were saying?

28:39.801 --> 28:41.761
[Rosemary] Portia,
from "Merchant Of Venice."

28:41.803 --> 28:43.681
Ophelia, from "Hamlet."

28:43.722 --> 28:46.766
Juliet,
from "Romeo and Juliet."

28:46.808 --> 28:47.893
Just name
the soliloquy,

28:47.934 --> 28:49.353
and prepare
to be impressed.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.270
You do know

28:50.312 --> 28:51.397
that moving pictures
are silent?

28:52.439 --> 28:53.649
Of course.

28:53.691 --> 28:54.900
Well,
I'm happy to pantomime.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.485
Shall we start
with Juliet?

28:56.527 --> 28:59.029
Like I said,
all the roles have been cast.

29:05.578 --> 29:06.412
Mr. Pope....

29:06.453 --> 29:07.787
I don't know
what I have to say

29:07.829 --> 29:08.622
to make you
change your mind.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.665
There's nothing to say.

29:09.707 --> 29:10.749
Now, if you'll excuse me...

29:10.790 --> 29:12.585
Have you ever wanted
something so much

29:12.626 --> 29:13.793
that you thought your heart
would simply stop beating

29:13.835 --> 29:14.794
if you didn't get it?

29:14.836 --> 29:16.004
Like some peace and quiet?

29:16.046 --> 29:17.047
And once within reach,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.258
was it kept from you
by one person?

29:19.299 --> 29:21.801
Someone who could
change your life

29:21.843 --> 29:23.762
if they simply said the word
"yes?"

29:26.848 --> 29:28.726
D.W. Griffith...

29:28.767 --> 29:29.976
on a one-reeler
called "A Sweet Revenge."

29:30.018 --> 29:31.811
He needed an assistant,

29:31.853 --> 29:32.812
but wouldn't give me
the time of day.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.481
I saw it
at the Princess Theater.

29:34.523 --> 29:35.441
I was doing summer stock.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.150
I didn't bother.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.821
Because
you were well-qualified,

29:41.863 --> 29:42.822
and he just didn't give you
the chance

29:42.864 --> 29:43.823
to show him what you could do.

29:43.865 --> 29:44.700
That's right.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.827
Well,
then you know how it feels.

29:47.869 --> 29:48.912
[chuckles]

29:53.833 --> 29:55.335
If that was acting,
you're better than I thought.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.296
It wasn't...

29:57.337 --> 29:58.631
and I am.

29:58.672 --> 29:59.839
In that case,

29:59.881 --> 30:01.425
you just got a chance
to prove yourself.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.718
Really?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.762
Oh, this is just
wonderful.

30:04.803 --> 30:05.845
I promise,
you won't be disappointed.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.974
Oh, of course,
I'll need a copy of the...

30:09.015 --> 30:09.808
script.

30:09.849 --> 30:10.850
Here you go.

30:10.892 --> 30:11.518
You'll be playing
the saloon girl.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.561
Does she have a name?

30:12.603 --> 30:14.187
Yes.
"Saloon Girl."

30:16.523 --> 30:17.524
I see.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.985
Well, thank you.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.362
Thank you for giving me
the chance of a lifetime,

30:22.404 --> 30:24.072
-the chance...
-Miss LeVeaux?

30:24.114 --> 30:26.450
I suggest you leave me in peace
before I change my mind.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.333
[Nora] Now that
the divorce is final,

30:34.374 --> 30:35.875
Dottie said
I could stay at her house

30:35.917 --> 30:36.876
for as long as I like.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.421
That's very generous of her.

30:39.463 --> 30:41.214
I gather things are sorted
with your father, then?

30:41.256 --> 30:43.883
Oh, yes, he likes living
with his brother,

30:43.925 --> 30:45.218
even though they fight
like cats and dogs.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.012
Well, let the two of them
duke it out.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.388
I'm just glad you're here.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.017
So, are you going to tell me
why you brought me up here?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.814
Well, a gentleman
named Clem Besser

30:56.855 --> 30:58.940
is selling this plot of land,

30:58.982 --> 31:02.695
and...
I'm thinking of buying it.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.657
Well...

31:06.699 --> 31:07.825
what about your place in town?

31:07.866 --> 31:10.035
Well, I figure I'm about ready
to move on

31:10.076 --> 31:12.287
to the next chapter of my life.

31:14.832 --> 31:15.833
How about you?

31:18.001 --> 31:20.086
I might be.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.925
[Jack] Surprised
to see you in town.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.886
Boss sent a few of us in
to get supplies.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.933
I thought
about what you said...

31:33.975 --> 31:34.934
about Edith and the boy.

31:34.976 --> 31:37.145
Your wife and your son?

31:38.313 --> 31:39.606
Yeah...

31:40.982 --> 31:42.942
Figured you could
give this to her

31:42.984 --> 31:44.069
next time you see her.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.571
The settlement's
just down by the river.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.572
It's easy to find.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.700
I've got to get back to work,
so...

31:51.827 --> 31:53.453
Roy...

31:53.495 --> 31:56.289
you know as well as I do
it's not about the money.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.999
It's about
doing the right thing,

31:58.041 --> 31:59.251
about being a man.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.925
Make sure she
gets that, will you?

32:09.887 --> 32:10.970
[♪♪♪]

32:11.012 --> 32:12.097
It's been some time

32:12.138 --> 32:13.306
since you and I
played poker together.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.725
You always were interested

32:14.767 --> 32:16.602
in winning things
that don't belong to you.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.686
Hm.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.022
I'll raise you 20.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.401
I think you're bluffing.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.071
It's going to cost you
to find out.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.077
Raise you 20 more.

32:39.708 --> 32:40.751
Ante up.

32:43.962 --> 32:44.963
I had
an interesting conversation

32:45.004 --> 32:47.048
with Tommy Northridge yesterday.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.426
Business must be booming
for him.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.677
He mentioned

32:50.719 --> 32:51.678
that you were interested
in Lee Coulter's sawmill

32:51.720 --> 32:53.430
a couple months ago.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.724
Before you go
barking up that tree,

32:55.766 --> 32:57.016
just let me make this
perfectly clear to you

32:57.058 --> 32:58.351
that I had nothing to do

32:58.393 --> 33:00.019
with whatever happened
at Coulter's mill.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.020
I didn't say you did.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.063
Why don't we drop the act?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.022
We both know
what's going on here.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.817
Why don't you tell me?

33:04.858 --> 33:06.025
Now Nora's back in town,

33:06.067 --> 33:07.402
nothing you'd like better

33:07.444 --> 33:09.613
than to drag me through the mud
just out of spite.

33:11.740 --> 33:12.991
How many cards you want?

33:13.992 --> 33:14.993
Three.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.379
What's your bet?

33:27.965 --> 33:28.966
I'm all in.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.013
I call.

33:37.557 --> 33:40.059
Queen of Clubs.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.728
Queen of Diamonds.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.106
Pair of kings.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.484
I'm not done yet.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.656
Queen of Hearts.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.994
Looks like I win.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.246
For now.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.291
[Lee] So what makes you think
Gowen is innocent?

34:03.333 --> 34:07.086
Well, I can't be sure,
but he has a tell.

34:07.128 --> 34:09.088
When he bluffs,
his eyes shift to the left.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.549
And he wasn't bluffing

34:10.590 --> 34:12.342
when you asked him
about the sabotage at the mill?

34:12.384 --> 34:15.303
No, I don't think he was,
but it's not hard evidence.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.849
Well, if Gowen isn't
pulling the strings,

34:18.891 --> 34:21.351
then who is?

34:21.393 --> 34:23.061
That's a good question.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.068
[laughing]

34:32.070 --> 34:33.864
She's really having
fun, isn't she?

34:33.906 --> 34:34.656
Mm-hmm.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.366
I just can't
understand

34:36.408 --> 34:38.618
why she hasn't even
tried to walk.

34:38.660 --> 34:40.078
[children laugh]

34:45.166 --> 34:46.251
Thanks.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.169
Do you think
we're making things

34:48.211 --> 34:51.130
too easy on her?

34:51.172 --> 34:52.758
Maybe,

34:52.799 --> 34:55.761
but I think
it's all right for now.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.930
You're telling me
to be patient.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.140
She has to want to walk,

35:01.182 --> 35:02.392
and she will...

35:02.434 --> 35:04.728
when she's ready,
not when we want her to be.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.146
Mm.

35:07.188 --> 35:08.941
[children laugh]

35:18.700 --> 35:20.159
I guess this tells me
all I need to know.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.370
This is his way
of helping right now.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.414
If he wanted to help,
he'd be here,

35:24.456 --> 35:26.708
but he's not.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.711
It's my fault.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.504
I wasn't a good wife to him.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.631
It was hard for him.

35:32.672 --> 35:33.966
I should have been
more understanding.

35:34.007 --> 35:35.884
Edith, you have to believe me.

35:35.926 --> 35:36.718
This has nothing
to do with you.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.428
This is about Roy.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.179
He doesn't love me.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.180
That's not it.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.850
I think he's scared.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.185
Deep down, he knows
he never should have left,

35:46.227 --> 35:49.106
and right now, he doesn't think
he can handle the responsibility

35:49.147 --> 35:50.983
of being a father,

35:51.024 --> 35:53.276
but he still cares
about you.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.112
I saw it in his eyes.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.614
No, he doesn't.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.699
He just feels sorry for me.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.368
There's more to it than that.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.207
Here.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.585
I don't want this.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.295
I don't want anything
from him.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.596
Now, here...

36:21.638 --> 36:23.222
this is where
I have a question.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.599
You enter the saloon.

36:24.641 --> 36:25.767
What don't you
understand?

36:25.809 --> 36:27.435
But how do I enter
the saloon?

36:27.477 --> 36:29.771
Am I happy to be there?
Am I sad?

36:29.813 --> 36:31.356
Am I worried that perhaps
there's an evil villain

36:31.397 --> 36:32.357
out to harm me?

36:32.398 --> 36:33.274
You're coming to work.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.567
Yes, I know,

36:34.609 --> 36:36.235
but what is my motivation?

36:36.277 --> 36:37.195
It's your job.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.447
Mr. Pope.

36:39.489 --> 36:41.199
I'm a professional actress,

36:41.240 --> 36:42.325
and I'm just trying
to protect

36:42.367 --> 36:43.242
the essence
of my character.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.243
Your character?

36:44.285 --> 36:45.162
Mm!

36:45.203 --> 36:46.371
[chuckles]

36:46.412 --> 36:47.873
Here's some news.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.290
It's not your character
anymore,

36:49.332 --> 36:50.792
because you are...

36:50.834 --> 36:52.752
[man]
Rosemary LeVeaux?

36:54.295 --> 36:55.630
That's me.

36:55.672 --> 36:58.967
It is an honor
to meet you.

36:59.009 --> 37:01.302
I saw you
in "The Grieving Widow."

37:01.344 --> 37:02.971
Three times, actually.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.263
[laughs]

37:04.305 --> 37:07.100
Pleased to meet you,
Mr...?

37:07.142 --> 37:08.727
Addison.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.603
James Addison.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.563
I own
Omnigraph Pictures.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.398
The James Addison?

37:13.439 --> 37:14.440
In the flesh.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.819
Tobias, how on earth

37:17.861 --> 37:20.739
did you manage
to land Rosemary LeVeaux?

37:20.780 --> 37:22.949
I've... always had
an eye for talent.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.743
[Addison]
Lucky for me.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.204
Miss LeVeaux...

37:27.245 --> 37:29.372
how would you like
to become a movie star?

37:32.625 --> 37:33.877
More bad news.

37:34.502 --> 37:35.795
How bad?

37:37.547 --> 37:39.799
The head saw's gone.
Blown motor.

37:39.841 --> 37:41.426
It cut into
a spiked log

37:41.467 --> 37:42.886
we took from the
northwest parcel.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.597
[Hickam]
I rode up there to have a look.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.306
Half a dozen of our trees
are spiked.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.267
No sign of anyone,
just some tire tracks.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.603
Well, that's it.

37:51.644 --> 37:52.645
Without a head saw,
there's nothing we can do.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.605
There's no point
cutting down trees.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.314
They're just going
to pile up.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.733
I hate to say it, sir,

37:56.775 --> 37:58.693
but I think
we have to shut down.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.653
I have never shut down
a day in my life.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.322
I don't see where
we have a choice.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.282
Do you?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.493
All right.
Get the men together.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.870
They better hear this from me.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.503
Is there any dessert?

38:17.545 --> 38:18.463
Oh, I can bake some cookies.

38:18.504 --> 38:19.380
It won't take long.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.548
Can I help?

38:20.590 --> 38:22.341
You mean,
can you lick the bowl?

38:22.383 --> 38:23.551
[she laughs]

38:23.593 --> 38:26.054
Yes,
but do your homework first.

38:26.096 --> 38:27.264
Elizabeth, have you seen

38:27.305 --> 38:28.347
the new linens
in the dining room?

38:28.389 --> 38:29.348
No, I haven't.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.267
Oh, let me show you.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.226
I want to get
your opinion.

38:33.352 --> 38:35.396
Can somebody
grab me my notebook?

39:47.760 --> 39:51.014
I am so proud of you.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.310
[Elizabeth]
Sometimes our smallest actions

39:55.352 --> 39:57.103
lead to our biggest victories.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.438
Watching Becky
find the strength

39:59.480 --> 40:01.482
to try to break free
from her self-imposed prison

40:01.524 --> 40:04.694
was both inspiring
and humbling.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.155
It reminded me
that despite our fears,

40:07.197 --> 40:10.242
we can overcome any obstacle

40:10.283 --> 40:11.868
when we allow the courage
granted to all of us

40:11.910 --> 40:13.452
to unleash our human spirit.

40:13.494 --> 40:16.455
The future for Becky...

40:16.497 --> 40:17.707
for all of us...

40:17.749 --> 40:19.709
is known
only to a greater power,

40:19.751 --> 40:24.047
but we help define our path
by our strength of character,

40:24.089 --> 40:26.465
a truth I will strive
to celebrate

40:26.507 --> 40:28.593
in all of my writing.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.431
[Abigail] Be good,
and I'll see you after school.

40:37.894 --> 40:39.104
Have a great day.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.939
Bye.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.481
You be good.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.447
Be safe.
Don't dawdle.

40:56.495 --> 40:57.997
[door opens]

40:58.039 --> 40:59.291
[woman] Hello?

41:00.708 --> 41:03.753
Oh! Hello.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.047
I'm running a little
behind this morning,

41:06.089 --> 41:07.048
but if you give me
five minutes,

41:07.090 --> 41:08.007
I'll put the tea on.

41:08.049 --> 41:09.467
You're Abigail Stanton?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.511
Yes, I am...
and you are?

41:12.553 --> 41:13.930
Carolyn Connors.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.181
I'm looking for Becky
and Cody Hastings.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.516
I heard they were
staying with you.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.851
They are.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.228
May I ask
what this is about?

41:21.104 --> 41:23.440
I'm their aunt.

41:28.445 --> 41:30.488
[♪♪♪]
