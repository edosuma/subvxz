<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:02.335 --> 00:05.566
-I want to move in with Dan.
-Over my dead body.

00:05.638 --> 00:06.969
What does Dan have over you?

00:07.040 --> 00:09.235
How did you convince her
that you didn't have HCM?

00:09.309 --> 00:12.005
I used Keith's negative-results letter.

00:12.078 --> 00:14.808
<i>She left to be with Chris.</i>
<i>She kissed him before she left.</i>

00:14.881 --> 00:17.349
My investigator found
something interesting about Dan.

00:17.417 --> 00:20.409
Let's just go slow, okay?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.080
Okay.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.181
You know there's a girl
you have feelings for.

00:25.258 --> 00:27.954
-Nathan--
-Look me in the eye. Tell me I'm wrong.

00:29.329 --> 00:31.263
You need to talk to her, Luke.

00:31.631 --> 00:35.032
-I've decided to tell Keith the truth.
-Maybe you won't have to.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.569
I think I'll just let this one go.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.897
Keith doesn't ever have to know.

01:53.513 --> 01:54.605
Hey!

01:56.015 --> 01:57.004
Hey.

01:57.917 --> 02:01.284
You're a little early and underdressed.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.616
Yeah, well, you know,
just making sure everything's okay.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.893
-Anything I can help you with?
-No.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.631
You've done enough. Everything is perfect.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.992
I'm getting married today.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.202
I didn't know rock stars
were such early risers.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.905
-We just finished rehearsing all night.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:30.176
Don't let me stop you
from falling into bed with Chris.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.377
<i>It's not like that and you know it.</i>

02:33.553 --> 02:35.453
I don't know anything anymore.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.280
I was just calling to tell you
that we're gonna be on TV.

02:39.359 --> 02:42.726
We're doing this live interview
and I was hoping you'd watch.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.855
That's why you called?

02:44.998 --> 02:48.559
Nathan, none of this means anything
if I can't share it with you.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.431
Keith's wedding's today.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.474
-He's getting married?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

02:56.075 --> 02:57.565
It won't last.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.544
What can I say to make things better?

03:03.616 --> 03:07.211
-Because I really want to, you know.
<i>-You can't.</i>

03:10.557 --> 03:12.582
That's the part you have to live with.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.132
That was a word.

03:29.275 --> 03:32.244
-That was definitely a word.
-In what, Swahili?

03:32.312 --> 03:35.440
She said ''dada.'' My baby's a genius.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.409
Okay, major news!
Brooke Davis is officially 24 hours away...

03:39.485 --> 03:41.817
from being student-council president
and rich again.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.482
-What, you and Felix getting married, too?
-Please.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.720
My dad has his final job interview
with this giganto company today.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.159
They're taking him to play golf.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.221
And while my dad may not be
the brightest tool...

03:52.298 --> 03:55.028
in the wherever-they-keep-tools,
he can play golf...

03:55.101 --> 03:57.661
-like freaking Michael Jordan.
-Okay.

03:58.338 --> 04:01.830
Hello! Mrs. Jaglieski.
You two are totally in bed together.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.239
-Brooke--
-This is great.

04:03.309 --> 04:06.574
I am gonna go and do
almost-rich-girl things...

04:06.646 --> 04:09.581
and you are going to call me later
with the details.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.386
-Dada.
-She's saying ''dada!''

04:22.595 --> 04:25.996
Just leave the caviar.
I've acquired a taste for it.

04:28.635 --> 04:31.502
You know, there's gonna be free food
at Keith's wedding today.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.996
No, thank you. I'm not going to that.

04:34.073 --> 04:37.270
-You really gonna do that to Keith?
-Look who's talking.

04:37.343 --> 04:39.743
I can't believe you're letting him
go through with it.

04:39.812 --> 04:42.144
He loves her and she loves him.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.416
She just made a mistake.

04:44.751 --> 04:47.447
You gonna crucify her
for the rest of her life?

04:50.556 --> 04:52.615
Haley called this morning.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.356
-That's great.
-Yeah.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.692
To tell me she's gonna be on TV today.
You believe that?

04:57.764 --> 05:01.097
-That's still awesome for her.
-Yeah, whatever.

05:02.869 --> 05:06.032
Look, Nate, I think you should
come to the wedding.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.203
A lot of people miss you.

05:08.274 --> 05:11.334
Nathan. I'm so glad you're here.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.374
-Let me make you some eggs.
-I think you're out.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.584
It's so good to see you.

05:24.023 --> 05:25.217
Sorry.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.109
Great day for a wedding.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.375
-What do you want?
-Brought you a present.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.048
Something blue, right?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.552
-I'm not taking it.
-Come on.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.694
It's your final payment.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.486
-You said we were done.
-And we are.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.465
I just wanted to say,
''Welcome to the family.''

06:45.471 --> 06:47.769
It's so easy for you, isn't it?

06:48.574 --> 06:50.769
Dan Scott, King of the World.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.612
But someday somebody's
gonna bring you down.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.473
And I can't wait to watch.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.781
Don't hold your breath, sweetheart.

07:15.835 --> 07:18.269
-Did you talk to your investigator?
-I did.

07:18.337 --> 07:21.272
-Anything I can use to get Lucas back?
-Yeah.

07:22.208 --> 07:25.405
-Have you ever heard of Emily Chambers?
-No, why?

07:27.246 --> 07:29.544
I think Dan's having an affair.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.856
Emily Chambers.
I've never even heard of her.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.591
But Dan sure has. He's paying her rent...

07:45.665 --> 07:48.463
and bills. Personal check.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.937
Why am I even surprised?

07:53.573 --> 07:54.870
Poor Deb.

07:54.941 --> 07:58.377
Karen, I know you care for Deb,
but Dan's not fighting fair here.

07:58.444 --> 08:01.379
If we want to get Lucas back,
we have to beat him at his own game.

08:01.447 --> 08:04.575
My guy's working on a photo.
We should find Emily first.

08:10.756 --> 08:14.248
-A little liquid courage for the groom?
-Hello, Nathan.

08:14.927 --> 08:18.920
It's not too late to stop him.
Tell him what kind of hell he's really in for.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.391
Like someone should have done for me.

08:21.467 --> 08:24.766
You're getting pretty good
at the moody-broody bit, aren't you?

08:24.837 --> 08:28.238
-Trying to give Lucas a run for his money?
-Whatever.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.836
-Let's have it.
-What's that?

08:30.910 --> 08:32.900
The inspirational story.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.477
Isn't this the part where you tell me
everything's gonna be okay?

08:36.549 --> 08:39.518
I'm sorry. The pity store's closed today.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.320
Besides, I'm not sure
you're worth it anymore.

08:43.389 --> 08:45.254
-Great.
-Look, son.

08:45.324 --> 08:48.020
You took a big risk
and I admire you for that.

08:48.094 --> 08:51.461
But it's easy to be happy
when things are going well.

08:52.498 --> 08:55.626
Marriage is about making it through...

08:55.701 --> 08:58.795
staying together
even when things turn to crap.

08:58.971 --> 09:02.873
-Looks like I got my story anyway.
-Would you grow the hell up?

09:03.309 --> 09:05.869
You might not like Haley
very much right now...

09:05.945 --> 09:07.037
but she's still your wife.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.240
Where I come from
that still means something...

09:09.315 --> 09:11.078
whether you like it or not.

09:13.352 --> 09:17.789
There's your story.
By the way, his ID is fake.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.304
Knock knock!

09:45.518 --> 09:47.986
Crazy girl,
what are you doing to my heart?

09:48.054 --> 09:51.046
Good thing you don't have
that genetic defect.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.689
Yeah. What are you doing here?

09:54.560 --> 09:57.461
I just came by to let you know
that my safe-rides program...

09:57.530 --> 10:00.192
D W Not I, is officially up and running.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.427
So pass the word at the reception.

10:02.802 --> 10:06.260
Drunken, bitter bridesmaids and Deb.

10:07.573 --> 10:08.699
Yeah.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.735
It's a shame
I'm not gonna be there myself...

10:14.347 --> 10:17.839
to let everyone know about the program.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.811
-What?
-I don't know.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.982
Big, romantic ceremony...

10:28.194 --> 10:30.185
followed by a big, fancy party.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.025
I know.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.466
And then there's the flowers
and the dresses and the vows.

10:36.535 --> 10:38.059
Not to mention my best-man speech.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.231
Come on, you're killing me.
You know I'm a sucker for weddings.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.275
Any chance you could use a date...

10:43.342 --> 10:46.539
in a just-friends sort of way,
to pal around with?

10:47.279 --> 10:49.213
-What about Felix?
-Grounded.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.977
His parents found out
about the Bash for Brooke.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.088
And, besides, we said
we were gonna try to be friends.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.456
Yeah, we did.

11:00.059 --> 11:04.052
Please, Lucas. I want to go so bad.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.756
Okay.

11:07.133 --> 11:11.160
It's a date.
Kind of, sort of, not really, okay.

11:11.237 --> 11:14.229
Yeah, whatever.
I'm in, just pick me up early.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.672
Hello, hottie!

11:25.317 --> 11:29.344
-This one wasn't my mom's.
-Yeah, well, neither was this one.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.986
I kind of Anne Franked a couple things
in the attic before the yard sale.

11:35.061 --> 11:37.086
So, you're going to the wedding?

11:39.298 --> 11:40.663
With Lucas.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.400
-Just as friends.
-Really?

11:45.304 --> 11:48.137
Come on, love triangles are so last season.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.606
So, Felix is totally cool with it, right?

11:52.344 --> 11:54.869
I actually haven't told him yet.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.407
-Brooke.
-I know.

11:56.482 --> 12:00.043
I've never just been friends
with a guy before, except Mouth...

12:00.119 --> 12:02.110
-and that's different.
-Well, how's it going?

12:02.188 --> 12:04.349
Good! Felix is my boyfriend.

12:04.423 --> 12:07.153
Lucas and I are just friends, I promise.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.586
-But I love you for looking out for me.
-Okay.

12:12.131 --> 12:15.862
On the subject of boys,
how are things going with Jake?

12:16.736 --> 12:19.034
You know, still taking it slow.

12:19.538 --> 12:23.872
-Slow is good. Fast is better.
-Shut up.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.913
-Lucas, hi.
-Hey.

12:32.184 --> 12:35.176
-You better get dressed.
-Yeah, I know.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.748
I know Nathan was
kind of abrupt this morning.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.617
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

12:43.529 --> 12:46.623
-I'm fine.
-Deb...

12:49.168 --> 12:50.931
after my accident...

12:51.537 --> 12:56.065
the doctors prescribed me
some really powerful painkillers.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.211
Except for they gave them to my mom...

12:59.278 --> 13:02.008
because they knew
how easy it would be for me...

13:02.448 --> 13:05.508
or anyone, for that matter,
to become addicted.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.645
Have you been spying on me?

13:10.089 --> 13:13.684
-I was....
-You are a guest in my house, Lucas.

13:13.759 --> 13:15.693
And as long as you're living
under my roof...

13:15.761 --> 13:18.787
I would appreciate you
not snooping around in my life.

13:19.698 --> 13:23.327
-Deb, I'm just trying to help.
-God, yeah, that's just what I need.

13:23.402 --> 13:26.269
An adolescent boy
to solve all my problems.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.463
-Deb?
-Get the hell out of here, Lucas.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.908
You are way out of line.
And way out of your league.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.420
So, you still think this looks weird?

13:50.930 --> 13:53.865
-And it feels pretty good, too.
-I love you.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.331
God, that kind of came out, didn't it?

14:02.508 --> 14:03.566
No.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.737
Not that I don't mean it...

14:07.346 --> 14:09.837
'cause I've been dying
to say that for a while now.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.315
It just never seems like the right time.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.677
With Lucas being thrown into jail...

14:14.753 --> 14:18.086
and me getting a private investigator,
it's just....

14:26.031 --> 14:27.430
I love you.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.534
I love your mind. I love your heart.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.867
I love picturing our future together.

14:32.938 --> 14:37.034
I hate the thought
of you ever not being in my life.

14:37.276 --> 14:40.006
-Andy--
-I don't want you to say anything.

14:41.847 --> 14:44.475
You know, I just had to get that out.

14:45.317 --> 14:46.909
I love you, too.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.549
I was hoping you'd say that.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.155
-Peyton!
-I'm so sorry. I'm not ready yet.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.632
Just give me two seconds.
I'm being a total girl.

15:02.701 --> 15:04.498
That's okay. We've got time.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.269
Wow!

15:17.716 --> 15:19.616
''Total girl'' is right.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.019
It's a good thing
that we're taking it slow, right?

15:28.694 --> 15:30.821
Yeah, slow.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.258
Yeah.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.372
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.511
You know you look amazing, right?

17:02.488 --> 17:03.716
Thanks.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.396
-How you feeling?
-Happy.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.766
Yeah, me, too.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.377
Man, we're gonna be late.

17:31.483 --> 17:34.509
Weddings always start
a little bit late anyway, right?

17:35.054 --> 17:38.820
-At least a half hour.
-Works for me.

17:50.602 --> 17:52.160
It's beautiful.

17:53.105 --> 17:56.563
-Thank you for bringing me, Lucas.
-You're welcome.

17:59.211 --> 18:02.442
So, how are things with Felix?

18:04.049 --> 18:05.983
Good! Great.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.686
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.849
He helped me with my campaign
and threw me a party.

18:14.193 --> 18:15.785
So you guys are good?

18:17.162 --> 18:20.928
I don't know. He's been so sweet.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.337
Really, but, lately I just kind of
find myself feeling...

18:27.739 --> 18:30.230
independent, amazingly.

18:31.376 --> 18:34.209
I don't know if I even want
a boyfriend right now.

18:35.214 --> 18:39.651
I guess we're both finding
a new way for ourselves.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.279
I guess so.

18:45.023 --> 18:47.651
Okay, listen up. You'll go out.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.160
They'll ask you a couple questions.
Keep it positive.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.821
You're thrilled to be on TV.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.262
It's all about living the dream.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.027
-Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.199
-Take off the wedding ring.
-What?

18:57.269 --> 18:59.533
It's a love song, Haley.
Look, you and Chris...

18:59.605 --> 19:01.937
you sound like a couple,
you look like a couple...

19:02.007 --> 19:05.170
-let them think you're a couple.
-But we're not a couple.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.844
-Details.
-Yeah, come on, Haley.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.912
AII right, look.
The girls should want to be you...

19:12.985 --> 19:14.714
and the guys should want to be with you.

19:14.786 --> 19:17.050
The wedding ring
kind of gets in the way of it all.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.453
For some people.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.517
Okay, you guys can figure it out...

19:22.594 --> 19:25.461
but, trust me, I'd lose the ring.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.999
-I'm leaving right now!
-Listen, I'm not--

19:28.600 --> 19:31.125
I cannot believe
you're asking me to do this.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.602
Haley, this is our shot.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.298
-Nothing else matters.
-Nathan matters.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.136
Then what are you doing here?

19:36.208 --> 19:39.143
Listen, you made a decision.
Don't blink now.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.770
<i>All right, I'm Nick Zano</i>
<i>and this is</i> Totally Live Week.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.474
<i>That was</i> Chariot.
<i>The new one from Gavin DeGraw...</i>

20:17.549 --> 20:19.983
<i>who's on tour right now</i>
<i>with The Wreckers...</i>

20:20.052 --> 20:23.317
<i>otherwise known as Michelle Branch</i>
<i>and Jessica Harp.</i>

20:23.388 --> 20:25.948
<i>Also on that tour are two newcomers...</i>

20:26.024 --> 20:29.084
<i>whose single,</i> When the Stars Go Blue,
<i>drops next Tuesday.</i>

20:29.161 --> 20:31.459
<i>We're here live</i>
<i>with Chris Keller and Haley James.</i>

20:31.530 --> 20:33.964
<i>-Haley James-Scott.</i>
<i>-Uh-oh, three-name rule.</i>

20:34.032 --> 20:37.490
<i>-Girls with three names are trouble.</i>
<i>-This one's no different.</i>

20:37.769 --> 20:40.033
<i>Okay, now, you guys have</i>
<i>great chemistry.</i>

20:40.105 --> 20:43.006
<i>Obviously a great sound.</i>
<i>Now, tell the truth.</i>

20:43.175 --> 20:45.109
<i>Are you a couple in real life?</i>

20:45.410 --> 20:47.935
<i>-Actually--</i>
<i>-You know, the music never lies.</i>

20:49.047 --> 20:52.107
<i>Say no more. You heard it here first.</i>

20:52.217 --> 20:54.617
<i>All right, let's take another look</i>
<i>at those tour dates...</i>

20:54.686 --> 20:56.620
<i>and we'll be right back after this.</i>

21:00.926 --> 21:03.622
Same color as that shirt.
You know where you're sitting, right?

21:03.695 --> 21:05.424
-See you inside.
-Have fun.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.731
-Could I get one of you two?
-Absolutely.

21:12.504 --> 21:15.098
-Well, my son cleans up good.
-Thank you.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.902
-How are you, Deb?
-Great.

21:18.176 --> 21:21.543
-The place is beautiful.
-I think we're gonna head inside.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.139
-Save a slow dance for me, Miss Davis.
-Okay.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.407
You old perv.

21:29.855 --> 21:32.824
-Sorry.
-It's okay, I get worse than that...

21:32.891 --> 21:35.325
from drunk high-school boys
every Saturday night.

21:35.394 --> 21:39.262
It's worse when it's not drunken
high-school boys, but it's your dad.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.700
I've never heard you call him that before.

21:43.101 --> 21:46.161
I'm trying it out. See how it sounds.

21:46.271 --> 21:48.102
And what do you think?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.838
Okay, it's freezing in here.

21:52.911 --> 21:55.675
Yeah, that's probably by design.
Keith's kind of a sweater.

21:55.747 --> 21:59.478
-Especially when he's nervous.
-Okay, things I never needed to know.

22:00.018 --> 22:03.977
-Sorry. Look, there you go.
-Thank you.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.924
Look, I have to see Keith.
Start being the best man.

22:08.427 --> 22:11.328
-You gonna be okay?
-Well, can your ego handle it...

22:11.396 --> 22:14.456
if I tell you I just needed someone
to get me in the door?

22:14.533 --> 22:17.798
-Not really.
-Then, boy, I am gonna miss you.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.596
Yeah.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.847
OId habits die hard.

22:35.587 --> 22:37.817
-It's just water, smart-ass.
-Yeah.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.924
-It's just so damn hot in there.
-You're gonna be fine.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.325
Yeah, I know.
But I'm still glad you're here, though.

22:45.597 --> 22:48.157
Even if you are still living with the devil.

22:50.135 --> 22:52.569
Hey, listen, I don't want to get mushy...

22:53.605 --> 22:56.096
-I just want to say thanks.
-For what?

22:56.241 --> 22:59.210
Just for being you
and for being my best man.

23:00.412 --> 23:01.902
You really are, you know?

23:01.980 --> 23:05.040
And I'm real proud of the man
you're turning out to be.

23:05.584 --> 23:07.745
Who do you think I learned it from?

23:12.457 --> 23:16.416
-Just give me a second.
-Yeah, I'll be inside.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.628
You look amazing.

23:26.705 --> 23:30.197
Thanks. So do you. As always.

23:32.344 --> 23:35.905
It's good to see you so happy.
Jules is great.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.071
Yeah, she is.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.981
It's like I finally found
my place in the world...

23:42.154 --> 23:44.315
and it was right here all along.

23:45.490 --> 23:46.787
I'm glad.

23:49.327 --> 23:50.692
Come here.

23:57.302 --> 24:01.568
AIso, I really appreciate you and Deb
standing up for Jules, you know.

24:01.807 --> 24:05.004
-She really doesn't have anybody else.
-Of course.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.441
Thank you.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.181
-And now I've got some vows to go make.
-Yes, you do.

24:12.684 --> 24:14.879
-I'll see you up there.
-Okay.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.988
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

24:26.565 --> 24:30.023
-I've got to pick something up real quick.
-Right now?

24:30.335 --> 24:32.360
Hey, I'll be right back. Trust me.

24:32.437 --> 24:35.406
I don't want to miss seeing you
walk down that aisle.

24:43.548 --> 24:45.175
Don't look at me.

24:48.186 --> 24:51.553
-Have you been crying?
-Just tearing up a little.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.054
-I read your speech.
-Brooke.

24:56.061 --> 24:59.189
Don't leave your journal
where I can find that, either.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.059
It was beautiful.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.693
''Remember tonight,
for it is the beginning of always.''

25:07.706 --> 25:11.233
That's Dante. We read him last semester.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.542
And I need to pay more attention
in English.

25:14.613 --> 25:15.739
Yeah.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.074
The rest is me.

25:20.952 --> 25:24.217
That part about taking chances
and believing in the possibility...

25:24.289 --> 25:27.850
even when life has given you
every reason not to believe.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.422
That's what so great about weddings.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.195
How two people come together.

25:37.802 --> 25:42.205
And even if it's just for one night,
they make us believe again.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.836
Stop, I don't have any more tissues.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.040
Here.

25:52.350 --> 25:56.047
I just hope at my wedding someone says
something that nice about me.

25:56.354 --> 25:58.515
I think you can count on that one.

26:00.959 --> 26:03.951
Oh, my God! You guys totally did it.

26:08.166 --> 26:12.762
-Brooke, we're in a church.
-So, if I can tell, so can he.

26:17.008 --> 26:18.373
Black tie.

26:19.177 --> 26:23.273
I haven't worn one of these things
since Dick Nixon was in office.

26:23.381 --> 26:28.011
-Look what happened to him.
-Well, I appreciate the effort.

26:28.453 --> 26:32.116
I feel like a penguin. Where are your folks?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.890
They're on safari, believe it or not.

26:35.961 --> 26:39.226
My dad's off
killing big animals or something.

26:39.297 --> 26:41.663
What has happened to the world,
for God's sake?

26:41.733 --> 26:43.291
Their son's getting married!

26:43.368 --> 26:45.393
Well, they offered to cancel but I knew...

26:45.470 --> 26:47.734
Royal would just pout about it
the whole time...

26:47.806 --> 26:50.604
so I just told them to come on down
next month and meet Jules.

26:50.675 --> 26:53.200
So for right now, you're all I've got.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.576
Lord help you, if that's true.

26:56.681 --> 27:00.515
Maybe you'd like
a little boost from Mr. J.D.

27:01.753 --> 27:04.745
Actually, I think
I'm gonna do this one sober.

27:05.657 --> 27:08.023
True love! That's a good one.

27:08.893 --> 27:10.861
Don't do it, Keith!

27:10.929 --> 27:13.454
Just get out while you can! It's all a lie!

27:16.468 --> 27:18.868
There's no such thing as forever.

27:21.239 --> 27:25.107
What the hell are you doing?
This is a church, for God's sake!

27:25.276 --> 27:28.507
Shut your hole, you freaking hypocrite.
I know what you did.

27:28.580 --> 27:32.949
-Nathan, it's okay. Let us help you.
-Do what?

27:33.585 --> 27:35.712
-Be happy again.
-Happy?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.320
You don't even know
how to be happy, Mom.

27:38.423 --> 27:40.618
Haley and I never stood a chance with you.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.626
Is that what you think?

27:43.962 --> 27:47.523
-You hired Chris, too?
-Don't make me knock you out, son.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.124
Screw you, you sick son of a bitch.

27:53.104 --> 27:55.937
Hey, come on now. Hey!

27:56.307 --> 27:59.572
Don't do this to Keith. Not here, all right?

28:01.279 --> 28:04.077
-Come on.
-Nate?

28:07.719 --> 28:09.414
What are you doing, man?

28:09.621 --> 28:13.148
She said she was with Chris,
on national TV.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.155
-I don't believe it.
-Neither did I.

28:19.197 --> 28:22.394
-It's really over, huh?
-Only if you say it is.

28:24.502 --> 28:26.163
I'm hurting, Luke.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.901
-It's gonna be okay.
-No, I mean I think I'm gonna puke.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.916
-D W Not I, at your service.
-Okay.

28:41.519 --> 28:43.146
Watch your head.

28:45.190 --> 28:47.715
This is perfect. And I don't mean
what happened today...

28:47.792 --> 28:51.523
just for D W Not I,
it's so great that Nathan got smashed.

28:54.032 --> 28:56.694
-Just make sure he gets inside, okay?
-Thanks.

29:01.372 --> 29:03.431
-Thank God you're back.
-We have a problem.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.408
I know.
Nathan's a mess and we have to start.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.445
-I found Emily Chambers.
-What?

29:08.780 --> 29:10.247
Emily Chambers is Jules.

29:30.168 --> 29:34.002
-You all set?
-Yeah, I've just got to get my veil.

29:35.673 --> 29:39.473
Sure. Let me help you with that, Emily.

29:43.414 --> 29:45.143
Did Lucas tell you?

29:47.852 --> 29:50.650
He knows you're having an affair
with Dan?

29:51.656 --> 29:55.023
-I'm not having an affair with Dan.
-Really?

29:56.728 --> 29:58.423
Then tell me...

29:58.496 --> 30:02.364
why would Dan put you up
in an apartment and pay all your bills...

30:02.500 --> 30:06.129
and seemingly control
every detail of your life unless....

30:09.007 --> 30:11.771
Oh, my God. It's Keith.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.306
He's paying you to get back at Keith.

30:14.379 --> 30:17.246
-He was.
-You're a whore.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.114
No. I was in trouble.

30:20.218 --> 30:22.152
The wedding was never part of the plan.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.984
It changed. I told Dan I wanted out.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.148
I fell in love with Keith for real.

30:28.393 --> 30:32.489
How could you do that to Keith
after everything that he has been through?

30:33.064 --> 30:35.692
You mean after everything
you put him through?

30:39.237 --> 30:40.727
How dare you?

30:42.173 --> 30:46.109
How dare you? You didn't want him.

30:46.945 --> 30:50.176
Now that he's actually found someone
who loves him back...

30:51.282 --> 30:53.978
you want to take that away from him, too?

30:54.352 --> 30:58.254
I want him to know who you really are.

31:00.892 --> 31:02.689
The moment of truth.

31:07.065 --> 31:11.627
He's happy, Karen.
Can't you just let him be happy?

31:15.106 --> 31:17.734
Was it awesome? Just give me a hint.

31:18.476 --> 31:21.536
-Brooke.
-I know we're in a church.

31:22.113 --> 31:26.243
So, blink once if it was good
and twice if it was better than that.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.856
My God, I love weddings!

31:51.576 --> 31:53.134
-You okay?
-I don't know.

31:53.211 --> 31:55.577
-What did she say?
-It's not Dan.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.076
-She loves Keith.
-And you believe her?

32:06.190 --> 32:07.885
I think I have to.

32:08.693 --> 32:10.422
That's our cue. Got to go.

32:45.830 --> 32:47.855
Your mom looks beautiful.

34:09.414 --> 34:11.938
I'm sorry. She left.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.922
-Give me your keys.
-Keith.

34:25.996 --> 34:27.931
Just give me your keys.

34:31.601 --> 34:33.297
Keith.

34:47.685 --> 34:48.879
Keith.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.793
You said you were done.
That you'd leave them alone.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.892
I didn't do anything.
I promise you, Lucas...

35:04.969 --> 35:07.403
I wouldn't jeopardize
my relationship with you again.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.838
You sick bastard.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.701
I threatened to tell Keith.

35:15.012 --> 35:18.470
I found out about your arrangement
and I went to Jules.

35:19.917 --> 35:22.078
And I threatened to tell the truth.

35:34.932 --> 35:37.696
Nice work, Cupid. This one's on you.

36:04.662 --> 36:08.996
<i>Remember tonight,</i>
<i>for it is the beginning of always.</i>

36:15.006 --> 36:19.966
<i>A promise, like a reward</i>
<i>for persisting through life so long alone.</i>

36:50.741 --> 36:51.765
Jules!

37:03.221 --> 37:07.783
<i>A belief in each other</i>
<i>and the possibility of love.</i>

37:16.867 --> 37:19.392
<i>A decision to ignore...</i>

37:19.470 --> 37:22.200
<i>simply rise above the pain of the past.</i>

37:31.916 --> 37:35.977
<i>A covenant,</i>
<i>which at once binds two souls...</i>

37:36.087 --> 37:38.214
<i>and yet severs prior ties.</i>

37:46.430 --> 37:48.125
What have we done?

37:50.401 --> 37:51.595
Karen.

37:52.603 --> 37:53.968
I'm sorry.

37:55.373 --> 37:57.170
I need to see Keith.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.227
<i>The celebration of the chance taken...</i>

38:19.664 --> 38:22.132
<i>and the challenge that lies ahead.</i>

38:41.986 --> 38:43.283
One down.

38:48.192 --> 38:49.557
One to go.

39:09.547 --> 39:12.015
<i>For two will always be stronger than one.</i>

39:12.183 --> 39:15.152
<i>Like a team braced against</i>
<i>the tempests of the world.</i>

39:15.286 --> 39:18.949
-Can you say ''dada''?
-Hey, Jenny, who is that?

39:20.591 --> 39:22.149
Mama.

39:25.296 --> 39:26.490
Nikki.

39:43.214 --> 39:47.207
<i>And love will always be</i>
<i>the guiding force in our lives.</i>

39:59.497 --> 40:01.465
What are you doing here?

40:02.666 --> 40:05.294
Making sure you find
the kind of happiness...

40:05.369 --> 40:07.234
I can barely remember.

40:13.043 --> 40:16.444
Go get Haley. She's your wife.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.530
<i>For tonight is mere formality.</i>

40:36.600 --> 40:40.263
<i>Only an announcement</i>
<i>to the world of feelings long held...</i>

40:41.038 --> 40:45.941
<i>promises made long ago</i>
<i>in the sacred space of our hearts.</i>

40:49.513 --> 40:51.310
What, more bad news?

40:52.783 --> 40:54.580
My dad got that job.

40:56.554 --> 41:00.081
-Brooke, that's great.
-It's in California.

41:03.561 --> 41:05.495
We're moving next week.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.397
I don't want to go.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.875
What are we gonna do?

42:21.005 --> 42:22.029
English

42:23.305 --> 42:29.180
