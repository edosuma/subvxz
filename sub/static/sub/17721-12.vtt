00:01.541 --> 00:03.750
Julianne: Reycraft, absolutely
not. No!

00:03.750 --> 00:06.875
I said... absolutely not.
Reycr--

00:06.875 --> 00:09.125
Uh, no!

00:09.125 --> 00:11.000
Erica: Have you ever watched
someone do their job and
thought...

00:11.000 --> 00:11.958
- Reycraft!

00:11.958 --> 00:14.000
Erica: I could never do that.
That's not me.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.083
- Listen, I don't care if your
father's the mayor of Timbuktu,

00:16.083 --> 00:17.500
until you're ready
to talk to me with respect,

00:17.500 --> 00:19.333
do not bother. Jesus.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.916
Erica: It's an important thing
to be able to determine

00:20.916 --> 00:22.833
what we can and can't do.

00:22.833 --> 00:24.833
What fits and what doesn't.

00:24.833 --> 00:27.000
Who you are and who you're not.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.958
- Did you, do you want a latte
or something?

00:28.958 --> 00:30.791
'Cause that was just...
that was really intense.

00:30.791 --> 00:33.083
- Oh, that? Oh, please,
that was breakfast.

00:33.083 --> 00:35.958
And, hello?
Junior editors do not brew.

00:35.958 --> 00:37.833
Now, about your promotion.

00:37.833 --> 00:39.666
- Yeah, you know,
it still doesn't feel real.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.166
- Well, it's not.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.875
Not until Galvin signs off.
So, until then,

00:42.875 --> 00:45.541
I'd like you to get up close
and personal with that.

00:45.541 --> 00:47.125
- "Baking the soul"
by Linda Kaplan.

00:47.125 --> 00:49.166
- You know, it's our cooking
slash self-help guide?

00:49.166 --> 00:50.875
As part of your portfolio,

00:50.875 --> 00:52.458
along with "The none"
and then Marcus Stahl's book.

00:52.458 --> 00:53.833
So, go read and give me
coverage.

00:53.833 --> 00:55.333
- Will do.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.041
- Oh, and, Erica?
- Yes.

00:57.041 --> 00:59.916
- Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life.

00:59.916 --> 01:01.791
- (inhales) Thank you.

01:01.791 --> 01:03.541
- (Small laugh)

01:06.125 --> 01:07.958
(Office phones ringing)

01:11.750 --> 01:13.625
- Whatcha doin'?
- Reading.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.000
- What you reading?
- Manuscript.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.083
- What you think?
- So, Erica,

01:17.083 --> 01:19.208
do we have another bestseller
on our hands or what?

01:19.208 --> 01:21.291
- (Whined breath)
- Oh, no, what's wrong?

01:21.291 --> 01:23.458
I'm just-I'm comparing
this draft of the notes

01:23.458 --> 01:24.958
from a previous editor.

01:24.958 --> 01:26.583
And Linda hasn't made
any of changes.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.000
It-it's still written
in first person,

01:28.000 --> 01:29.916
it's still boring
and, ugh, the title...

01:29.916 --> 01:31.708
Honestly, "Baking the soul"?

01:31.708 --> 01:34.083
- Well, the original title
was "Deep fried karma".

01:34.083 --> 01:36.833
This is actually a step up.
- Dory said it was bad.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.958
- Bad? Linda Kaplan's answer
to a mid-life crisis

01:38.958 --> 01:41.041
is an avocado quesadilla.

01:41.041 --> 01:44.208
- Mm.
- I don't recommend that, um,
that we publish this.

01:44.208 --> 01:46.666
- (Sighs) bummer.
I hearted the pitch.

01:46.666 --> 01:48.333
But if both you and Dory
are saying she's not delivering

01:48.333 --> 01:50.000
then it's time to give her
the boot.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.875
Time to tell Linda
she's done like dinner. 'Kay?

01:52.875 --> 01:56.750
- What, me?
You want me to do it?

01:56.750 --> 01:57.583
- Yeah, you.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.833
And do it today before she
hands in any more chapters.

01:59.833 --> 02:01.375
Just get her on the phone,

02:01.375 --> 02:03.083
and tell her she needs
to come in. Pronto-Toronto.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.583
- Oh, no, Julianne,
look, I'm really, um...

02:04.583 --> 02:06.208
I'm really good at, you know,
taking notes and reading,

02:06.208 --> 02:07.666
but I don't...
I don't think that I can...

02:07.666 --> 02:09.625
- Fire someone?

02:09.625 --> 02:12.166
Well, "newsflash",
that's part of the job.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.625
You're a manager now, Erica,

02:13.625 --> 02:15.625
please start acting like one.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.291
Go get your hands dirty.

02:17.291 --> 02:18.916
- With the raise you're about
to get,

02:18.916 --> 02:20.875
I think you can afford
the manicure.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.250
Can we at least sit down?

03:10.250 --> 03:12.083
- No, I can't. I have to get
back to the office.

03:12.083 --> 03:13.166
Linda, she's gonna
be there in...

03:13.166 --> 03:14.958
Less than ten minutes,
that's great.

03:14.958 --> 03:16.416
- You're being ridiculous.

03:16.416 --> 03:17.791
I mean, it's not that big
a deal.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.291
- No. I'm not being ridiculous,
okay?

03:19.291 --> 03:21.041
I've never done this before.
I've never fired anyone before.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.375
And I can tell that Julianne,
you know,

03:22.375 --> 03:24.000
she's just doing it to test me,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.458
to see if I'm deserving
of this promotion.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.333
I mean, why else would
she have me do it?

03:27.333 --> 03:28.208
I don't even know Linda!

03:28.208 --> 03:30.416
- Okay, don't get paranoid,
all right?

03:30.416 --> 03:32.750
Just... just go in there,
and tell the author

03:32.750 --> 03:35.041
"it isn't working out".
Okay? Just the facts.

03:35.041 --> 03:36.875
Just keep it real, unemotional.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.458
The same facts that
you told me.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.750
- Unemotional, because that
really sounds like me.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.875
I mean, is it normal
to feel nauseous?

03:42.875 --> 03:44.791
- Yup.

03:44.791 --> 03:48.708
- Jude, there are some things
that I know that I can do,

03:48.708 --> 03:52.208
but this?
- Trust me, you can.

03:56.291 --> 03:57.791
Linda: Go on. (giggles)

03:57.791 --> 03:59.791
I baked them especially for you.

03:59.791 --> 04:02.958
I call them "better tarts".
(laughs)

04:02.958 --> 04:05.125
They're your everyday
butter tart,

04:05.125 --> 04:07.750
but with spirulina
and royal jelly,

04:07.750 --> 04:10.083
for a little added zing.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.958
Huh? (laughs)
- Mm-hmm.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.666
- Um... Linda.

04:15.666 --> 04:18.250
Julianne asked me
to come in here and--

04:18.250 --> 04:19.666
- Talk about the book, uh-huh.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.166
Have you read my first chapters?

04:21.166 --> 04:23.750
- I did. Yes, I did.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.958
I tackled those while planning
my daughter Tecca's wedding.

04:25.958 --> 04:29.458
- Mm.
- And... undergoing
emergency surgery.

04:29.458 --> 04:32.041
- Emergency surgery?
- Don't worry, it's all fine.

04:32.041 --> 04:36.333
Turns out it's not the big "c",
after all. (Titters)

04:36.333 --> 04:37.875
I just, you know, in the end,
had to...

04:37.875 --> 04:40.833
put my shoulder to the wheel
and I got the job done.

04:40.833 --> 04:41.750
- Mmm.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.416
Well, the chapters there,
uh, there interesting.

04:43.416 --> 04:46.416
- Oh..."interesting"
Usually means "bad".

04:46.416 --> 04:48.333
- No-no, not bad,
not bad per se.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.958
It's just you, uh you didn't
really address our notes.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.958
- Oh, am I in trouble here?

04:52.958 --> 04:55.041
I have worked so hard on these,
Ms. Strange.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.791
- Oh, please, it's Erica.

04:56.791 --> 04:58.708
- If I have done something
wrong,

04:58.708 --> 05:00.375
If Julianne is upset with me...

05:00.375 --> 05:03.250
Linda, don't worry, okay?
We just, um...

05:03.250 --> 05:05.916
- (Exhales heavily)
- We need to, uh...

05:07.666 --> 05:09.208
(Exhales and stutters)

05:09.208 --> 05:10.708
Linda, would you just
give me a minute?

05:10.708 --> 05:12.833
I'll, uh, I'm gonna be right
back. Okay?

05:18.791 --> 05:21.250
- Isn't Linda supposed
to be the one

05:21.250 --> 05:23.125
walking out of that room
like her world just imploded?

05:23.125 --> 05:24.583
Brent: You didn't fire her,
did you?

05:24.583 --> 05:25.333
- Uh... No.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.666
Brent, could you please go
show Erica how it's done?

05:27.666 --> 05:29.375
- Hmm.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.750
(Hums casually)

05:31.750 --> 05:34.083
- I'm sorry, it's just she was
so upset.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.291
- Can you stop talking
and watch.
- So upset.

05:36.291 --> 05:37.958
- River Rock Publishing
no longer needs your services.

05:39.541 --> 05:40.750
- Oh... I don't,
I-I don't understand?

05:42.250 --> 05:43.708
Erica-Erica and I...

05:43.708 --> 05:46.208
- It's no longer working out.

05:46.208 --> 05:47.916
Linda: Okay.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.291
(Office phones ring)

05:53.125 --> 05:54.750
- Thank you.
Julianne: Thank you, Brent.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.750
Erica, in my office now!

06:01.625 --> 06:03.166
- Ugh...

06:03.166 --> 06:05.708
Julianne, I'm sorry,
I messed up.

06:05.708 --> 06:08.041
- Yeah! Which is why you'll be
spending all day tomorrow,
right here.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.416
Uh, tomorrow? It's...
I mean, it's Saturday.

06:09.416 --> 06:11.166
And the first Saturday
of each month,

06:11.166 --> 06:14.750
River Rock hosts leadership
training for its managers.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.416
Tomorrow's session will be
hosted by the one and only,

06:16.416 --> 06:18.166
Thomas Friedken, author...

06:18.166 --> 06:19.875
- Of "The Secret of Now",
I know that, yeah.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.500
- People draw blood
to get into his sessions.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.333
So, consider yourself
extremely lucky

06:23.333 --> 06:25.333
'cause I'm giving you my spot.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.333
Thank you, and you know what?
I think management training

06:27.333 --> 06:29.958
is exactly what I need.
- Oh, I hope so.

06:29.958 --> 06:32.291
Because my spidey senses
are tingling, Erica,

06:32.291 --> 06:34.333
and not in a good way.

06:34.333 --> 06:35.958
I'm gonna be honest with you,

06:35.958 --> 06:38.083
Right now I'm wondering
if you're ready
for this promotion.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.250
- Um...
- Can, can you, can you go.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.083
- Go!
- Okay.

06:46.416 --> 06:47.708
Ethan: You sent me those
papers, Claire!

06:47.708 --> 06:49.208
You asked to divorce me!

06:49.208 --> 06:50.666
Claire: That was before,
before all this...

06:50.666 --> 06:53.041
Ethan: No, Claire there is no
"before this", okay?

06:53.041 --> 06:55.375
(Door creaks open)

06:55.375 --> 06:58.000
- Oh, well, look who it is.
- Is everything okay?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.291
- No, everything's not okay.
Claire's just leaving.

07:00.291 --> 07:02.000
Hey, you don't get to call
the shots here, Ethan.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.125
- Why don't you back off?

07:04.125 --> 07:05.625
- Why don't you mind
your own business?

07:05.625 --> 07:07.750
- You know, I was trying to
make work but then you go and--

07:07.750 --> 07:09.250
- I go and I what, Claire?

07:09.250 --> 07:11.250
I didn't do anything
you didn't do first.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.333
- Oh, fine.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.416
You know, if this is the way
you want it to work?

07:14.416 --> 07:15.708
Expect a call from my lawyer.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.041
- (Huffs)

07:21.041 --> 07:23.416
Well, you finally got him.
Only took you 10 years.

07:29.333 --> 07:32.166
- Hey, what's going on?
- I can't believe her.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.250
- What did she do?
- She wants to sue me
for support.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.083
- How can she do that?
She's rich.

07:36.083 --> 07:38.083
- Her dad's rich. Point is,
Claire wants to make me pay,

07:38.083 --> 07:39.583
any way she can.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.458
(Papers flap) Just-

07:43.458 --> 07:46.541
Doesn't make any sense.

07:46.541 --> 07:48.375
- So what are you gonna do?

07:48.375 --> 07:51.333
- Well, normally I'd give in;
that's what she expects.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.083
You know, I spent my entire
marriage giving in to her

07:53.083 --> 07:54.333
and I'm done.
I'm-I'm fighting back.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.666
- You are?

07:56.666 --> 07:59.333
I mean, don't take this
the wrong way, but I just, I...

07:59.333 --> 08:01.166
I didn't think you had it
in you.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.708
- Sure I had it in me.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.083
It's just easier to do
what comes naturally.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.041
But that's not a good enough
reason.

08:07.708 --> 08:09.375
- So I'm guessing you, um,
you lost your appetite.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.375
Oh, um, is it okay
if I take a rain cheque?

08:11.375 --> 08:13.000
I really need to call my lawyer.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.458
- Oh, of course.
Listen, don't worry,

08:14.458 --> 08:16.083
I'm right next door, okay?

08:16.083 --> 08:18.208
One knock away.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.000
- Uh...

08:26.708 --> 08:28.916
- Here, keep the curry,
you might get hungry.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.166
(Door clicks shut)

08:36.958 --> 08:38.333
Thomas Friedken: Bienvenido.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.791
Yin dee. Willkommen.

08:39.791 --> 08:41.416
Welcome to Thomas Friedken's

08:41.416 --> 08:43.333
"weekend warriors
management training".

08:43.333 --> 08:44.958
I think we're gonna start
the day off

08:44.958 --> 08:47.041
by just jumping right into it,

08:47.041 --> 08:50.541
by sucking right from the teat
of, ah, group dynamics.

08:50.541 --> 08:52.833
So, who do you think you are?

08:55.500 --> 08:57.416
That is the eternal question.
And using five adjectives,

08:57.416 --> 08:59.541
I would like each and every
one of you to tell us

08:59.541 --> 09:03.041
your best personal qualities
that you bring

09:03.041 --> 09:06.208
to your careers as managers,
okay?

09:06.208 --> 09:07.666
Why don't we start with you?

09:07.666 --> 09:09.500
- Okay, um... commanding.
Decisive.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.500
Potent. Red-blooded. Virile.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Oh, and fierce.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.458
But you only let us, like, five.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.083
- All right, you rule...
with strength.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.500
- Spare the rod,
spoil the child.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
- Argh! I like that. I like it.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.000
Uh, who shall we go with next?
How about you?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.666
What was your name again?

09:30.666 --> 09:33.375
- It's Erica.
It's, um, it's Erica Strange.

09:33.375 --> 09:35.250
- Okay, you got to say that
with more conviction, okay?

09:35.250 --> 09:36.666
See? (bellowed tone) Baaa!

09:36.666 --> 09:38.125
Start from down here, you see?

09:38.125 --> 09:39.541
Start from down here,
and you say...

09:39.541 --> 09:41.125
Say-say, you say it, like...

09:41.125 --> 09:43.541
(bellowed tone) Erica Strange!

09:45.458 --> 09:47.208
- (normal tone) Erica Strange.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.625
- Proceed.
- Okay, um...

09:50.625 --> 09:53.333
The words to describe
my management style are...

09:53.333 --> 09:56.500
in... in no particular order:

09:56.500 --> 09:58.541
fun and friendly. Easy going.
Supportive.

10:01.041 --> 10:03.083
And, ah...

10:03.083 --> 10:04.541
Nurturing.

10:04.541 --> 10:06.083
- Right. Because, you know,

10:06.083 --> 10:09.416
whilst Hannibal marched
his war elephants over the Alps

10:09.416 --> 10:12.083
during the second Punic war,
he was easy going.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.833
He was fun, he was friendly.

10:13.833 --> 10:16.541
- Well, those are my strongest
qualities, Mr. Friedken.

10:16.541 --> 10:18.458
- And that is your problem,
dear. Okay?

10:18.458 --> 10:20.500
Now I want you
to come over here.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.250
Yes, I want you to...

10:22.250 --> 10:24.083
bring your whole body
and come right here.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.916
Okay? All right, now...

10:25.916 --> 10:28.166
You say you're friendly.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.916
I say that you can
also be scary.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.041
- Not really.
- No, aggressive!

10:33.041 --> 10:34.458
- No.
- Ruthless!

10:34.458 --> 10:35.958
No-no, not... not at all.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.958
- Yeah, okay, you see,
now that right there,

10:37.958 --> 10:40.291
that is... is your box!

10:40.291 --> 10:42.708
That's your box.
That's your identity, right?

10:42.708 --> 10:45.333
And on the surface,
you're all nurturing and fun

10:45.333 --> 10:48.833
and, ooh, kittens,
and little bunnies.

10:48.833 --> 10:51.583
But you gotta step
outside of the box!

10:53.708 --> 10:56.125
Now come on, push me.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.666
- Uh... Mr. Friedken?

10:57.666 --> 10:59.583
- Come on, push me.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.166
- (Uncomfortable groans)

11:01.166 --> 11:02.666
Mr. Friedken, I can't.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.458
- Ooh-ow-wow, let's dance then.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.166
Do you wanna dance?
Is that what it is?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.000
Is it dancing?
You see, dancing.

11:09.541 --> 11:11.041
Hey, look, look. See, come on.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.541
So you see that? You see...

11:12.541 --> 11:13.916
Okay, so what are you
feeling right now?

11:13.916 --> 11:15.750
Are you feeling...
Are you feeling a little angry?

11:15.750 --> 11:17.750
Are you feeling
a little uncomfortable?

11:17.750 --> 11:20.333
Yeah, because this isn't you,
this isn't your "thing".

11:20.333 --> 11:22.708
You see that?
But you, you do.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.291
You, dear, have to step outside.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.416
You gotta, hyiiiaa!
You gotta, yeaaah!!

11:26.416 --> 11:29.166
You gotta break out of the box.
You gotta at least try.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.833
- (Uncomfortable stammer)
- Okay...

11:31.833 --> 11:34.166
- I can't. I can't. I c-can't.

11:34.166 --> 11:36.375
- Oh...

11:36.375 --> 11:37.750
Uh-oh...

11:37.750 --> 11:39.791
Ooh.

11:39.791 --> 11:42.500
You see, there is a big
difference

11:42.500 --> 11:45.625
between can't and won't.

11:45.625 --> 11:48.541
Huge difference.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.208
Okay. (clicks teeth)

11:50.208 --> 11:52.166
Thank you. Good.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.250
I'll let, uh, Julianne know.

11:54.250 --> 11:57.041
Nothing more here.
I think you made your choice.

11:57.041 --> 11:58.625
It's okay.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.708
It's the way it goes.
Thank you.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.708
Thank you so much.
(Applauds) Nice.

12:02.708 --> 12:04.208
Not really.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.583
Okay, um... who's next?

12:06.583 --> 12:08.625
Who wants to have some fun?

12:08.625 --> 12:12.166
The next thing we're gonna do
is the growling exercise.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.583
I need you to pair up...

12:13.583 --> 12:15.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:15.583 --> 12:18.333
So how is management training?

12:18.333 --> 12:20.166
- I failed.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.250
- Hmm... because you couldn't
tango?

12:22.250 --> 12:25.208
- No, it's because, uh...
I'm easy going, not commanding.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.666
It's because I'm fun,
but not intimidating.

12:27.666 --> 12:29.416
It's because my inner tiger
is more like a kitten.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.375
I mean... what if I'm not meant
to be a manager?

12:34.875 --> 12:36.416
- Okay, let's go back.

12:36.416 --> 12:38.000
- You say that you're easy
going, but not commanding.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.041
You know, those two qualities
are not mutually exclusive.

12:41.541 --> 12:43.708
Why can't you be both?

12:43.708 --> 12:45.500
- I don't know, I...

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
You know I keep remembering
that quote that you once said,

12:47.500 --> 12:50.416
"learn to be what you are,
and learn to...

12:50.416 --> 12:52.708
- "To resign with good grace
all that you are not."

12:52.708 --> 12:55.500
Henri Frederic Amiel. Yeah?

12:55.500 --> 12:58.333
- I just feel like I'm hitting
the limitations of my ability,

12:58.333 --> 13:00.250
you know? And maybe...

13:00.250 --> 13:02.250
maybe it's time to face
the facts

13:02.250 --> 13:04.333
that I'm not cut out for this,
you know?

13:04.333 --> 13:06.416
Not everybody has what it takes
to be a boss.

13:06.416 --> 13:08.250
I think a better way to face it,

13:08.250 --> 13:10.125
would be to talk about "IF".

13:11.625 --> 13:13.083
- "IF?" (stammers)

13:13.083 --> 13:14.541
This has nothing to do with him.

13:14.541 --> 13:15.791
Can we please just
stick to the issue?

13:15.791 --> 13:17.833
- We are.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.750
- Fine, "IF".

13:21.750 --> 13:23.791
It's, um... It's short
for Ivan Frankel.

13:23.791 --> 13:25.541
It's, it's this guy
that I dated.

13:25.541 --> 13:27.208
I mean, he...
He was really sweet,

13:27.208 --> 13:29.458
but so not my type.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.833
It was 2001.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.833
I was fresh out of my masters

13:37.833 --> 13:39.583
and killing time
in this internet cafe.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.416
And Ivan and I,
we had the same shift.

13:43.416 --> 13:45.583
He was the tech,
and I handled the cash.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.125
He was friendly and sweet,

13:50.708 --> 13:52.791
and really comfortable
with who he was.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.708
And I'm not...
I'm not sure how it happened,

13:54.708 --> 13:57.583
but one day we just...

13:57.583 --> 14:00.541
and after that
we kind of stared dating.

14:00.541 --> 14:03.125
I mean, being with "IF",
it was like visiting
a different planet.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.583
And it was really fun
until this one day

14:06.583 --> 14:08.333
he decided that we should
go to this thing,

14:09.916 --> 14:11.416
what was it called?
It's, um...

14:11.416 --> 14:13.833
A vampire larp.
- Mm, what is that?

14:13.833 --> 14:15.416
- Live action role playing.

14:15.416 --> 14:16.958
It's some kind
of a make-believe

14:16.958 --> 14:19.000
Vampire game for grown-ups.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.791
Totally bizarre.
So, I knew I had to end it,

14:21.791 --> 14:23.875
You know, IF and I,
we were not gonna work out.

14:23.875 --> 14:27.291
But... I was so scared
to hurt him.

14:27.291 --> 14:29.416
- Like you were too scared
to hurt Linda.

14:29.416 --> 14:33.958
- Well, at least with Linda
I made an attempt, with IF...

14:33.958 --> 14:38.750
I... I left my shift that day,
I quit my job,

14:38.750 --> 14:39.875
and I never talked to him again.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.708
- Oh, you cut him off.
That's cold.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.583
- I was such a coward.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.250
It's not that I think that
IF was the love of my life,

14:46.250 --> 14:49.250
but he didn't deserve
to be treated like that.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.791
Such disrespect.

14:50.791 --> 14:52.541
- Okay, and if you could go
back?

14:52.541 --> 14:54.583
- I would do the hard thing.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.833
I would break up with him.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.166
- (Inhales) Hmm.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.291
- Face to face.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.333
(stammers) Oh!

15:03.333 --> 15:04.708
- What the hell?!

15:04.708 --> 15:06.291
- I'm... Uh...

15:07.875 --> 15:09.916
You killed it.
(keyboard keys clack)

15:09.916 --> 15:11.583
You killed my computer.

15:11.583 --> 15:12.875
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

15:14.791 --> 15:16.708
- Oh, I ruined it. Agh!

15:16.708 --> 15:18.750
- Nah, it just needs
to dry out, you know?

15:18.750 --> 15:21.250
Yeah, I can take it apart,
clean up the motherboard.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.708
Yeah, it'll be fine.

15:22.708 --> 15:24.166
- So, I'm-I'm not fired then?

15:24.166 --> 15:26.250
- (Scoffs) Not on my watch,
you're not.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.833
(Chuckles) come here.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.583
- Um...
- You know what today is?

15:30.583 --> 15:32.666
- No.
- It's our 10 day anniversary.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.458
- Oh.
- Happy anniversary.

15:34.458 --> 15:37.083
- You too.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.041
- Tonight calls
for awesome-ness.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.666
Are you up for some
awesome-ness?

15:40.666 --> 15:42.125
- Mm-hmm, I am.
- But you know what?

15:42.125 --> 15:43.833
I think that, I think that
we should talk first.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.833
- Yeah, sure, just let me tell
you what we're doing first,

15:45.833 --> 15:46.541
okay? (clears throat)

15:46.541 --> 15:49.958
You and me are going
to a vampire larp.

15:49.958 --> 15:51.583
- A vampire larp?

15:51.583 --> 15:53.375
- Yeah. Uh, a vampire.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.500
Immortal. Soulless.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.166
- IF, that sounds great,

15:57.166 --> 15:59.416
but I just, I think that
we should talk, okay?

15:59.416 --> 16:00.125
There's just...

16:00.125 --> 16:01.833
There's really something
that I need to tell you.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.750
- Okay, just wait.
Wait till you see this here.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.666
- Wow, that's a really
fancy walking stick.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.916
- Uh, it's a blood staff.
- Oh.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.500
- Oh.
- Ah-ha, good reflexes.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.750
Ha, you're a natural warrior.
Maybe I need to reconsider.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.250
- IF, please.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.416
- Please tell you
what larping is?

16:18.416 --> 16:20.375
Hmm, yeah, I guess it's not
a part of the general lexicon,

16:20.375 --> 16:22.208
now is it? Okay, um...

16:22.208 --> 16:25.125
Think of it like, um, playing
dress up or make believe.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.166
Uh, we dress as our characters
and we go out

16:27.166 --> 16:29.083
and interact with each other
in the real world.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.375
And then there's rules that
govern how we do battle,

16:31.375 --> 16:33.041
and how we role play.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.958
- Mm-hm. And why, why exactly,
would you want to do this?

16:34.958 --> 16:37.125
- Because it's fun. (laughs)

16:37.125 --> 16:39.750
Some people collect stamps.
Others golf.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.208
I larp. Heh.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.750
And starting tonight, so do you.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.833
Behold! You are Calliope.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.000
And you belong
to a secret sisterhood,

16:49.000 --> 16:50.791
uh, a coven that practices
healing blood magic.

16:52.416 --> 16:55.041
- Uh, where did you get
this picture of me?

16:55.041 --> 16:57.625
- Last week. From a web cam,
when you weren't looking.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.750
So, huh? What do you think?

16:59.750 --> 17:02.833
- Ah, well, I think that you're
really very good at photoshop.

17:02.833 --> 17:04.125
- Thank you.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.833
Ah! Your cape...

17:05.833 --> 17:08.041
- Oh, I really... Wow.

17:08.041 --> 17:10.875
- And... Yeah.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.500
You're gonna need this also.
Here. Yeah.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.916
This card spells out your stats.

17:14.916 --> 17:17.041
See, you've got a 5 empathy.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.958
Uh, that means that your power
is weighted towards healing.

17:19.958 --> 17:24.166
I'm also giving you one secret,
special power: shape-shifting.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.500
You know, like, uh,
Odo, on deep space nine?

17:26.500 --> 17:30.041
- Mmmm.
- Oh, um, in a nutshell,

17:30.041 --> 17:33.875
You can use your blood magic
to change into a Nosferatu.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.833
- (Growls)
- Oh.

17:36.833 --> 17:39.875
Yeah, I don't think
I ever want to do that.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.541
- (snarled voice)
I invoke blood magic

17:41.541 --> 17:44.458
to take the form of a Nosferatu.

17:44.458 --> 17:50.791
My intimidation is five,
I stare at you.

17:50.791 --> 17:52.666
What is your bravery?

17:52.666 --> 17:54.916
- My bravery?

17:54.916 --> 17:58.583
- One! Your bravery is one.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.750
You are petrified
at the sight of me.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.583
Get down on your knees.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.875
On your knees!
- (Erica yelps)

18:04.875 --> 18:06.833
Kneel before Master Cain!

18:08.583 --> 18:10.875
- I'm kneeling.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.791
- Yeah, see? And then you just
kind of take it from there.

18:13.791 --> 18:15.791
- (Uneasy moan)

18:15.791 --> 18:19.541
You know, my-my shift's over
and, um, I'm feeling hungry.

18:19.541 --> 18:21.708
Do you wanna maybe grab
a bite to eat?

18:21.708 --> 18:23.958
- Sure. (half laughs)

18:23.958 --> 18:25.625
- (to herself) Oh my God.
- Awesome!

18:27.666 --> 18:32.083
- Hey, I was thinking...
Master Cain is lonely.

18:32.083 --> 18:35.916
Might be nice for him to have
a mistress Cain by his side.

18:35.916 --> 18:37.875
You know? If only because
a healer

18:37.875 --> 18:39.958
is very fortuitous in battle.

18:39.958 --> 18:41.625
- IF, I really need to--

18:41.625 --> 18:43.333
- But not only because of that.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.708
- IF, I don't, I don't think
that I can do this.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.625
- Ah, what do you mean?
Wait. You don't wanna larp?

18:47.625 --> 18:49.750
- No, I don't... I mean,

18:49.750 --> 18:53.083
I don't think this relationship
is right for me.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.541
And that's what I've been
feeling

18:56.541 --> 18:59.083
and that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:59.083 --> 19:02.250
I'm sorry. Can we still
be friends?

19:02.250 --> 19:04.500
- Huh...

19:04.500 --> 19:06.375
Uh...

19:06.375 --> 19:10.125
Just wait a sec while I rip
this stake out of my heart.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.291
(playfully grunts) Argh!

19:12.291 --> 19:14.416
Yeah. (clears throat)
Yeah, of course we can.

19:14.416 --> 19:16.291
- Really?

19:16.291 --> 19:18.583
- And hey, you know,
if you, uh...

19:18.583 --> 19:20.625
if you still wanna
larp tonight, uh...

19:20.625 --> 19:23.333
I got all this gear
for you, so...

19:23.333 --> 19:26.791
- Ivan, thank you for
the invitation, but I just...

19:26.791 --> 19:28.708
I just don't think that
larping is really my thing.

19:28.708 --> 19:31.625
- Agh. Yeah, no-no, it's, uh...

19:31.625 --> 19:33.666
Hey, it's, it's cool.
Really, it's totally cool.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.250
- Really? Okay.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.708
- Uh, man, I-I gotta get,
get back to work.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.125
I got a couple hours
left on my shift,

19:39.125 --> 19:41.250
so, i'm just gonna...
- Okay, okay.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.750
- Oh, um, you know,
if you, uh...

19:43.750 --> 19:45.291
You change your mind
about tonight,

19:45.291 --> 19:47.875
Uh, we're gonna be meeting
at "the stake" at nine.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.750
I'll have my cell.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.125
- Okay. Vampires,
they use cell phones?

19:52.125 --> 19:55.125
- Yeah... (wings flap)

19:57.750 --> 19:59.291
I'll see you.

19:59.291 --> 20:01.791
- Live long and prosper.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.250
Wow.

20:18.208 --> 20:20.708
Wh-what are you doing, Dr. Tom?

20:24.750 --> 20:26.666
Okay, look, here's the deal,
all right?

20:26.666 --> 20:28.875
I came back and I did what
I was supposed to do.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.791
I-I broke up with IF.

20:30.791 --> 20:33.375
- In record time too.
So fast, in fact,

20:33.375 --> 20:35.708
you could probably squeeze in
a quick round of larping

20:35.708 --> 20:38.458
if you really wanted to.
- (Sarcastic laugh)

20:38.458 --> 20:40.416
Running around the city,
dressed as a vampire?

20:40.416 --> 20:43.125
That's... that's not really
my idea of fun.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.333
- Mm, still caring about what
other people think, huh?

20:45.333 --> 20:47.250
- No, this isn't me caring
about what other people think,

20:47.250 --> 20:50.041
all right? I'm not a larper!

20:50.041 --> 20:51.875
And I'm not a mime.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.916
- This really is quite
a small box

20:53.916 --> 20:55.625
you've got yourself living
inside.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.166
It must be very tiring,

20:57.166 --> 20:59.000
squeezing yourself
into that everyday?

20:59.000 --> 21:02.250
I am this, I'm not that.
I am this, I'm not that.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.625
I thought mimes were supposed
to be silent?

21:04.625 --> 21:07.458
Okay. Look, I know who I am.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.916
And I came back here
and I did what I had to do,
so...

21:09.916 --> 21:12.458
- So, why are you still here?

21:17.875 --> 21:22.000
- Uh, yeah, no, uh, no plans.
just killing time,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.166
waiting to see what the world
has in store for me.

21:24.166 --> 21:26.250
(Knock on door)

21:26.250 --> 21:29.458
Um, hey, Judith, I gotta go.
there's somebody at the door.

21:29.458 --> 21:30.875
Okay, bye.

21:37.791 --> 21:40.416
(Laughing outside door)

21:40.416 --> 21:42.791
- Uh, hey.
- Hi.
Claire: Hey.

21:44.458 --> 21:48.625
- Um... are we too early or...?
Did you say 6:30 dinner?

21:48.625 --> 21:50.791
- Um...
- Oh, uh...

21:50.791 --> 21:53.250
6:30 for dinner.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, I'm just running a little
bit behind,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.458
so, come on in.
- Okay.

21:58.458 --> 22:01.208
- Uh, make yourselves
comfortable.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.916
- So the wedding's going to be
in Montreal, in July.

22:03.916 --> 22:06.083
A summer wedding. (kiss)

22:06.083 --> 22:09.500
- Mmm! So are you planning
on moving there?

22:09.500 --> 22:11.916
- Oh, yeah, we're already
looking at houses.

22:11.916 --> 22:13.625
- Oh, we're not looking,
Claire's looking.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.833
- Don't start.

22:16.833 --> 22:19.375
He's upset because my dad's
buying us a house.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.083
- I just think we should
buy our own place.

22:21.083 --> 22:22.500
You know, we could afford
a condo.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.666
- No, you can't raise a family
in a condo.

22:24.666 --> 22:26.041
- Of course we can.

22:26.041 --> 22:28.000
What do you think, Erica?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.458
- Oh... (stammers)

22:29.458 --> 22:31.000
Really it's not my place to say.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.041
- Ethan, just let it go.

22:33.041 --> 22:34.333
My dad's buying us
a wedding gift.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.708
He's allowed. Okay?

22:36.708 --> 22:38.625
- Fine.
- Hm.

22:40.291 --> 22:42.000
Hey, we should go if we wanna
hit that club, huh?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.791
- Mmm.
- Can I use your bathroom?

22:43.791 --> 22:45.833
- Sure, it's right through
there.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.000
You know, Ethan, if you don't
wanna buy the house,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.541
Why don't you say something?

22:55.541 --> 22:57.833
- Um, didn't you see me,
saying something?

22:57.833 --> 22:59.458
- No, I saw you getting
beaten into submission.

22:59.458 --> 23:01.166
Why do you always do that?

23:01.166 --> 23:03.083
I mean, why do you always
let her win?

23:03.083 --> 23:06.125
- Um, well, that's just
how we do things?

23:06.125 --> 23:09.500
Claire has a lot of opinions
and I don't like to fight.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.416
- I know that you don't,
but sometimes you have to.

23:11.416 --> 23:12.875
I mean, are you gonna
live your whole life

23:12.875 --> 23:14.208
just giving in to things?

23:14.208 --> 23:16.416
If you feel strongly
about something then,

23:16.416 --> 23:18.500
you know, speak out, push back.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.583
- That's not how I work.

23:19.583 --> 23:21.125
- What do you mean
that's not how you work?

23:21.125 --> 23:22.750
- I don't like to push.
I'm not a fighter.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.000
It's just... not me.
- It's just not you.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.875
That is such a cop out.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.500
You're saying it's just not
you, like...

23:28.500 --> 23:32.333
It's not a choice you have,
but you do, you could fight.

23:32.333 --> 23:35.708
And, yeah, it would...
it could be horrible and...

23:35.708 --> 23:37.750
scary and hard,

23:37.750 --> 23:41.041
but you could do it.

23:41.041 --> 23:43.125
- Honestly, Erica,
it's just easier this way.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.125
- That's not a good enough
reason.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.750
(Washroom door opens)

23:50.250 --> 23:52.083
- Okay, let's go.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.125
Are you coming with us?

23:54.125 --> 23:58.291
- Um... actually, I think...
I think I'm gonna pass.

23:58.291 --> 24:01.041
My friend, he invited me
to this thing and...

24:01.041 --> 24:04.125
I wanna check it out.
- Okay.

24:04.125 --> 24:06.208
Well, dinner was superb.

24:07.916 --> 24:10.125
- No it wasn't, but thanks.

24:10.125 --> 24:12.041
- I'll call you later. Um...

24:12.041 --> 24:15.125
Maybe you can join us
after your thing.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.958
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:30.750 --> 26:33.333
The vampire's kiss
can be lethal.

we need to get our hands

26:49.666 --> 26:52.375
Leandra will be

Even if you made it

to Leandra?

29:07.291 --> 29:09.166
She doth demand justice.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.625
Magda: A battle is called.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.583
The troops are already
on their way.

29:14.250 --> 29:17.375
- Oh, dear. Did I do something
wrong?

29:17.375 --> 29:19.416
(Cacophony of jeers
and shouting)

29:21.583 --> 29:23.625
Ivan: Brothers and sisters
in blood,

29:23.625 --> 29:25.458
tonight we do battle
for the missing piece

29:26.958 --> 29:28.500
of the rune of elders.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.666
Defeat is not an option.

29:30.666 --> 29:33.833
We will be victorious!

29:33.833 --> 29:35.375
(Vampires cheer and holler,
Erica's cell phone rings)

29:35.375 --> 29:37.500
Ha! And when we prevail...

29:37.500 --> 29:39.958
All of the city shall kneel
at our feet.

29:39.958 --> 29:42.083
And our cups shall overflow
with sweet crimson blood,

29:44.208 --> 29:46.083
and we will reign supreme.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.750
Erica: Hello?
Ethan: Hey, that club had
a 2 hour line-up.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.666
So, I don't know if you wanna
meet up or if you're still mad?

29:51.666 --> 29:52.791
- No, hey, I'm not mad, okay?

29:52.791 --> 29:54.666
I'm just... I'm just concerned,

29:54.666 --> 29:57.208
you know, you really
sell yourself short, Ethan.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.750
Whoa!
- Go forth!

29:59.750 --> 30:02.916
Rise up and defeat our enemies!

30:02.916 --> 30:05.833
(Vampires cheer and holler)
Ivan: Ha ha ha!

30:05.833 --> 30:07.458
Ethan: Where are you?

30:07.458 --> 30:10.208
- Um, I'm... I'm larping
in a graveyard.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.833
- You're-you're what-ing
in a graveyard?

30:11.833 --> 30:14.500
- Look, it's too hard
to explain right now,

30:14.500 --> 30:16.208
but we're gonna be going
to "the stake" soon.

30:16.208 --> 30:17.750
Ethan: Oh, the goth bar?
- Yeah.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.083
Ethan: Okay, well, Claire and I
can meet you there, I guess.

30:20.083 --> 30:22.166
- No, Ethan, really, don't...
Whoa.

30:22.166 --> 30:24.541
Aahhh! Ouch!

30:24.541 --> 30:26.875
I was on the phone!

30:26.875 --> 30:29.416
Bodyguard: And now you have
lost a hand.

30:29.416 --> 30:32.416
- Oh, for Pete's sake.
(Frustrated sigh)

30:35.625 --> 30:36.875
(Patter of footsteps nearby)

30:39.583 --> 30:41.416
- Hey.
- Magda and Seven have been
burned to death.

30:41.416 --> 30:43.500
Leandra and her minions
draw close.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.500
I fear the end is nigh!
- Oh, well, do you...

30:46.500 --> 30:48.291
Do you want me to go, like,
heal them?

30:48.291 --> 30:49.708
Their bodies are ash.

30:49.708 --> 30:51.166
No, you must save your strength,

30:51.166 --> 30:53.500
heal those who still
have a chance.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.041
- Um... (clears throat)

30:55.041 --> 30:58.708
- I summon a burrowing stake.
It pierces your skin,

30:58.708 --> 31:00.875
tearing your flesh
for 3 points of damage.

31:00.875 --> 31:03.708
Bodyguard: Lethal hit one.
Lethal hit two!

31:03.708 --> 31:06.458
Lethal hit three!
- (Pained moans and grunts)

31:08.541 --> 31:11.041
Calliope, heal me!

31:11.041 --> 31:12.750
- (Panicked stuttering)
I don't know what to do?

31:12.750 --> 31:15.041
Bodyguard: Four!
Ivan: Argh! Wait, wait!

31:15.041 --> 31:18.000
We are granted one counter
strike.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.583
Agh. Raise your hand,
make a fist

31:20.583 --> 31:23.166
and say "I invoke blood sorcery
to heal the form".

31:24.833 --> 31:26.750
- (Reluctant breath)
- Raise your hand, Calliope!

31:26.750 --> 31:29.750
- The stake burrows deeper
into your chest.

31:29.750 --> 31:32.750
It pierces your ribs,
it hunts your heart.

31:32.750 --> 31:35.083
- I invoke the blood sorcery.

31:36.708 --> 31:38.500
Bodyguard: Lethal hit five
point of damage!

31:38.500 --> 31:40.291
- Calliope!

31:40.291 --> 31:43.125
- I invoke blood sorcery
to heal the form.

31:44.750 --> 31:46.541
- She cannot invoke
with a missing hand.

31:46.541 --> 31:48.833
I dispatched it
from her body myself.

31:48.833 --> 31:51.791
(Vampires snickering happily)
- Be this true?

31:51.791 --> 31:53.458
- Well, he dispatched one
of them.

31:53.458 --> 31:55.750
So, use the other hand.
- What difference does it make?

31:55.750 --> 31:57.833
-The stake pierces your heart!

31:57.833 --> 31:59.625
(Pained screaming)

31:59.625 --> 32:01.583
(Howled screams of agony)

32:04.250 --> 32:07.875
(Sputters and gurgles)

32:13.750 --> 32:16.375
I Leandra, control the rune
of elders.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.875
Queen's guard to me!
(high-pitched laughter)

32:22.333 --> 32:24.208
(Cheer and laugh giddily)

32:25.708 --> 32:27.250
- (Stunned breath)

32:28.750 --> 32:30.083
- Um...

32:32.833 --> 32:34.666
here's your thingy.

32:39.166 --> 32:44.666
- My friends, Leandra controls
the rune and thus the city.

32:44.666 --> 32:47.291
We all must pay homage
to her now.

32:48.916 --> 32:53.416
Ah. Rules allow
one final drink together,

32:53.416 --> 32:57.333
Then our clan is no more.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.875
- Hey, hey, look...

33:07.875 --> 33:09.958
at least I didn't, you know,
really lose my hand.

33:09.958 --> 33:12.125
And your heart's
still pumping, right?

33:12.125 --> 33:14.958
- This isn't a joke.
- No, I know.

33:16.791 --> 33:20.541
- All you had to do was call
out one simple spell.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.458
Like, it's taken me years,
Erica.

33:23.458 --> 33:25.208
Years! To get to the level
that I am at

33:25.208 --> 33:27.166
and yet I just lost it
all in one night.

33:27.166 --> 33:29.833
- I'm sorry.
- You tell that to Seven
and Magda

33:29.833 --> 33:31.291
when Leandra turns them
into peasants

33:31.291 --> 33:33.000
and strips away
all their powers.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
- I mean, it's not real.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.041
- Yeah, I know this isn't real.
Right, I'm not insane.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.875
- Okay, I'm sorry,
it's just it's...

33:39.875 --> 33:41.833
it's really crazy
to an outsider.

33:41.833 --> 33:43.625
It just... it is.

33:43.625 --> 33:46.708
- Look. One night,
every couple weeks,

33:46.708 --> 33:48.833
I get to hang out
with my friends,

33:48.833 --> 33:51.333
and bring out the person
who I really am, okay?

33:51.333 --> 33:53.125
Deep down.

33:53.125 --> 33:55.041
You know, not Ivan
the tech geek,

33:55.041 --> 33:57.916
or Ivan the girl-retard
who got dumped today.

33:57.916 --> 34:00.041
See, I get to be me.

34:00.041 --> 34:02.166
I get to show the world
the parts of Ivan Frankel

34:02.166 --> 34:04.333
that nobody ever imagined
he possessed, you know?

34:05.958 --> 34:09.250
Like strength and bravery
and confidence.

34:09.250 --> 34:12.583
But you... you just...
you only see the surface.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.583
You know, you see
duct tape weapons,

34:14.583 --> 34:16.625
and geeks running around
playing make believe.

34:16.625 --> 34:18.416
- No, that's not true.
- Really?

34:20.041 --> 34:21.750
(scoffs) You were embarrassed
to heal me,

34:23.333 --> 34:25.750
But... but who here
would judge you?

34:25.750 --> 34:27.791
Huh? No one.

34:27.791 --> 34:30.500
The only one judging you...
is yourself.

34:33.625 --> 34:35.416
(Huffs)

34:44.958 --> 34:46.791
(Dance music plays)

34:48.416 --> 34:51.000
(Low hum of chatter)

34:53.833 --> 34:55.416
Ethan: Erica.

34:56.916 --> 34:58.333
You're wearing a cape.

34:58.333 --> 35:00.083
- (stammers) I am.

35:00.083 --> 35:02.125
- Hey, no offense but I really
don't think this is your thing.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.875
- No, it's-it's not.

35:03.875 --> 35:05.958
- So, why don't I take you
to the little witch's room,

35:05.958 --> 35:07.958
wash off your face,
and we can go to a real bar?

35:10.041 --> 35:12.375
- That's, uh, that sounds
like a great idea.

35:16.250 --> 35:17.791
- You know, would you just...

35:17.791 --> 35:20.208
would you wait here for me
for a minute?

35:20.208 --> 35:21.458
There's something that
I need to do, okay?

35:21.458 --> 35:22.791
I'll be back.

35:26.083 --> 35:29.750
Leandra: (snickers)
Hello, little blood sorceress,

35:29.750 --> 35:31.708
have you come looking
for death again?

35:31.708 --> 35:34.333
(half laughs) Kill her.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.583
I... invoke blood sorcery
to turn me into a Nosferatu!

35:42.000 --> 35:43.625
(Hisses)

35:45.791 --> 35:47.666
I am now a Nosferatu.

35:50.041 --> 35:54.125
And as a shape-shifter...
my hand is restored!

35:54.125 --> 35:55.791
(Hisses)

35:57.958 --> 36:00.916
My intimidation is five!

36:00.916 --> 36:03.125
What is your bravery, wench?

36:04.666 --> 36:07.416
- My bravery is four.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.791
- Get down on your knees.

36:13.875 --> 36:16.041
Down on your knees!

36:18.041 --> 36:19.541
- (Hisses)

36:21.166 --> 36:23.750
- I invoke the power
of the rune of elders

36:23.750 --> 36:26.125
to grant me fearlessness.

36:26.125 --> 36:27.666
I cast crimson fire.

36:29.291 --> 36:31.583
Balls of flame are exploding
over you

36:31.583 --> 36:34.041
for three points of damage.

36:34.041 --> 36:35.791
(Pleased exhale)
What is your resistance?

36:35.791 --> 36:38.833
- My resistance...

36:38.833 --> 36:40.291
is a two.

36:40.291 --> 36:41.791
- (Scoffed laughter)

36:44.666 --> 36:47.500
- (Squealing)

36:47.500 --> 36:49.291
I'm melting!

36:49.291 --> 36:52.000
I'm melting! (squeals of pain)

36:57.125 --> 36:59.083
- Know your place
and stay there.

37:00.541 --> 37:02.708
- Yeah.

37:11.208 --> 37:13.000
- Nicely done.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.041
Kamikaze suicide mission.

37:15.041 --> 37:21.041
- Ivan, I... I'm so sorry
about all of this.

37:21.041 --> 37:22.708
- It's okay. (chuckles)

37:24.291 --> 37:26.833
Seven and I are actually
plotting our return.

37:26.833 --> 37:29.666
Yeah. As a new clan.
The Halavars!

37:29.666 --> 37:31.875
- So, um... I'll see you
around?

37:34.083 --> 37:36.125
Yeah.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.208
- (Hisses)

37:42.333 --> 37:46.250
Linda, um, I'm so sorry
about that. I just, uh...

37:46.250 --> 37:48.750
must have low blood-sugar
right now.

37:55.208 --> 37:57.416
- Well, honey, if you've got
low blood-sugar

37:57.416 --> 38:00.208
than a tart is exactly
what you need.

38:00.208 --> 38:02.958
I call these "better tarts".
(laughs)

38:02.958 --> 38:06.291
They're your everyday butter
tart, but with spirulina--

38:06.291 --> 38:08.083
- And royal jelly,
added for extra zing.

38:08.083 --> 38:09.916
- Yeah.
- I know.

38:09.916 --> 38:11.708
Uh, Linda, would you just
excuse me for one minute?

38:11.708 --> 38:13.208
I'll be right back.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.208
- Of course. But take a tart.
Don't argue.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.625
- Okay.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.458
(Office phones rings)

38:20.458 --> 38:22.625
Julianne: Erica? Where are you
going?

38:22.625 --> 38:24.125
Brent: Bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk.

38:24.125 --> 38:25.833
No-no, I'm not chickening out,
Brent, okay.

38:25.833 --> 38:28.583
I just need a minute, okay,
I just... I need a latte.

38:34.375 --> 38:36.708
- What is going on?
What am I doing back here?

38:36.708 --> 38:38.791
- I'm giving you a do-over.
- A do-what?

38:38.791 --> 38:40.333
- A do-over.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.916
To answer the question,
can you do this?

38:42.916 --> 38:45.041
Even though it scares you,
even though it's hard,

38:45.041 --> 38:46.875
even though you don't want to.

38:46.875 --> 38:48.958
Can you do what you need to do?

38:48.958 --> 38:50.833
- And since when is a do-over
allowed, hm?

38:50.833 --> 38:52.791
- Since when isn't it?

38:52.791 --> 38:54.791
- Look, that book, it's bad.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.250
And Linda, she completely
ignored are notes.

38:56.250 --> 38:57.750
And I know that it's
the right thing to do,

38:57.750 --> 38:59.625
but... I just, I can't...

39:01.250 --> 39:03.041
I can't help but feel,
you know, paralyzed.

39:03.041 --> 39:06.916
What if...what if she cries?
- What if she does?

39:08.375 --> 39:11.125
- I just, I can't go in there
and be all cold and unfeeling

39:11.125 --> 39:12.833
and do it the way
that Brent would.

39:12.833 --> 39:15.291
- Who says that you need to do
it the way that Brent would?

39:17.208 --> 39:20.625
Why don't you go in there and
do it the way that Erica would.

39:22.875 --> 39:25.916
"Thinking is easy,
acting is difficult,

39:25.916 --> 39:27.916
and to put one's
thoughts into action,

39:27.916 --> 39:30.875
the most difficult thing
in the world." Goethe.

39:30.875 --> 39:33.666
I think a fresh latte might help
things go down a little easier.

39:38.083 --> 39:40.000
- (Clears throat)

39:43.750 --> 39:45.750
- Oh. (half laughs)

39:45.750 --> 39:48.375
Well, aren't you a sweetheart.

39:48.375 --> 39:49.791
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:51.416 --> 39:52.875
So, I know you haven't
brought me in here

39:52.875 --> 39:54.416
just to make a latte.

39:54.416 --> 39:57.833
- No, I didn't, um...
it's about your book.

39:57.833 --> 39:59.875
- You've had a chance
to read my first chapters?

39:59.875 --> 40:01.875
I am so proud of them.

40:01.875 --> 40:04.416
- I'm sure you are, Linda.
You...

40:04.416 --> 40:06.375
You put a lot of hard work
into them.

40:06.375 --> 40:08.125
- Oh, that's wonderful.

40:08.125 --> 40:10.125
So, what do we do next?
This is my first book,

40:10.125 --> 40:12.083
it's all very new
and exciting for me.

40:13.500 --> 40:14.875
- Linda...

40:16.458 --> 40:17.875
I am sorry to have
to tell you this,

40:17.875 --> 40:19.291
but there isn't gonna
be a next step.

40:21.208 --> 40:23.250
- What do you mean?

40:23.250 --> 40:26.916
- Uh, I just, it's, um...
it's not working.

40:26.916 --> 40:28.500
You didn't address our notes
from the last pass

40:28.500 --> 40:32.625
and it just, it...it feels like
you have a different vision

40:32.625 --> 40:34.208
for the book than we do.

40:34.208 --> 40:37.375
- If I could have another
shot at making it work.

40:37.375 --> 40:39.458
- I'm sorry, you can't.
(Stammers)

40:39.458 --> 40:42.291
It's not working for us.
The book is not working for us.

40:45.208 --> 40:47.083
- Oh, my... (welling up)

40:48.750 --> 40:50.916
I can't believe this
is happening to me.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.083
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

40:53.083 --> 40:55.125
That's rich.

40:55.125 --> 40:58.500
- Linda...
- I didn't do the notes,

40:58.500 --> 41:01.125
because the notes
didn't make sense.

41:01.125 --> 41:05.250
You are paying me to share
my recipes with the world.

41:05.250 --> 41:07.916
And so I should be able
to do that

41:07.916 --> 41:10.250
exactly how I want to.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.208
Well, that's not
how this works.
- Fine.

41:16.458 --> 41:19.250
(Office door closes)

41:25.166 --> 41:26.583
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

41:26.583 --> 41:27.916
Could I have a word
before you go?

41:27.916 --> 41:29.958
- Of course.
- Sit.

41:32.250 --> 41:34.125
- Well, I gotta say,

41:34.125 --> 41:36.166
I wasn't sure you had it in you.

41:36.166 --> 41:38.083
- I wasn't sure myself at all.

41:39.708 --> 41:43.250
- (half laughs)
Well, you keep surprising me.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.375
Once upon a time,
I thought I was gonna
have to fire you, too.

41:45.375 --> 41:48.625
And instead, I get to do this.

41:48.625 --> 41:51.000
Do you see that
chicken scratch there?

41:51.000 --> 41:54.291
That is Frank Galvin's
signature.

41:54.291 --> 41:56.208
Your promotion
has been approved.

41:56.208 --> 41:58.583
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

41:58.583 --> 42:00.375
- Thank you, Julianne.

42:03.875 --> 42:05.625
Goodnight.

42:05.625 --> 42:08.041
Erica: At the end of the day,
it comes down to this:

42:09.625 --> 42:11.291
the way we choose
to see ourselves,

42:11.291 --> 42:14.250
it limits who we can be.

42:14.250 --> 42:17.041
Step outside the box
and you might learn something.

42:18.666 --> 42:22.041
Because we are more capable
than we imagine.

42:22.041 --> 42:24.083
Because we all have it in us

42:24.083 --> 42:26.208
to do things we've never
done before.

42:26.208 --> 42:28.291
- No, I don't wanna discuss it.
Then we'll go to court.

42:28.291 --> 42:29.708
I'm not settling,
I'm not gonna give in.

42:29.708 --> 42:31.708
If she wants to fight
then we'll fight.

42:33.125 --> 42:37.041
Erica: Because sometimes we
can surprise even ourselves.
