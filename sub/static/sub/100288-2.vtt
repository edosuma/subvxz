<i>Activist van at location,</i>

07:29.365 --> 07:32.118
<i>1, 5, 5,</i>

07:32.785 --> 07:34.454
<i>6, 5,</i>

07:35.371 --> 07:36.539
<i>2, 0</i>

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124
That's them.

07:43.838 --> 07:44.881
Hands up!

07:44.964 --> 07:46.048
Don't move!

07:46.674 --> 07:49.218
Where is he?<i> </i>Where is he?

07:49.302 --> 07:50.595
Don't shoot us!

07:51.012 --> 07:53.014
We don't know what you mean...

07:53.097 --> 07:54.348
we're just taking food to them.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.725
To who?

07:55.808 --> 07:57.185
To the refugees.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.107
-What?
-You need to come in.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.067
<i>I'm on an operation.</i>

08:05.151 --> 08:07.153
Then end it and come in.<i> </i>It's urgent.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.784
Come on. We're going back.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.130
You entered the facility at
3:05 a.m., correct?

08:27.673 --> 08:28.633
If you say so.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.593
And what were you doing there?

08:32.136 --> 08:34.764
I had returned to continue my
interrogation of the detainee.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.559
The detainee escaped
between 3:07 and 3:19 a.m.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.686
Just when you happened to be visiting.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.731
I was the one who discovered him missing.
I was the one who raised the alarm.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.776
Were you aware that the security
cameras in cell block D

08:46.859 --> 08:49.111
were switched off for twelve minutes
while the prisoner escaped?

08:50.112 --> 08:51.364
How would I know that?

08:51.739 --> 08:53.282
Just answer the question.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.492
Of course not.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.413
You weren't aware of any
tampering of footage that day?

09:00.915 --> 09:02.875
It's important you tell the truth.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.964
What's this asshole said?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.299
Officer Ben-Reuven claims you erased

09:12.969 --> 09:14.512
What the fuck is this?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.847
Answer the question, Avi.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.647
Yes, I erased the tape
of my interrogation.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.316
Why?

09:27.775 --> 09:29.860
He said nothing relevant. Simple as that.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.781
Might I remind you that lying in
a debriefing is an offense?

09:36.576 --> 09:37.785
Are we done?

09:40.621 --> 09:41.872
Thank you, Agent Dahan.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.585
So, it's just a coincidence
that the evidence

09:45.668 --> 09:47.211
of your interrogation with the detainee

09:47.295 --> 09:50.089
and evidence of his escape
were both erased?

09:51.132 --> 09:51.966
Who is this?

09:53.593 --> 09:55.344
Why am I answering to a fucking American?

09:55.761 --> 09:59.015
We're cleaning up the mess you made.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.726
It would serve you better to cooperate.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.269
You brought me in for this?

10:32.256 --> 10:33.924
What was that in there?

10:35.259 --> 10:36.719
Protocol.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.262
Something you have no idea about.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.389
Hey.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.601
Have you found a place to live yet?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.103
You need to sort yourself out, Avi.

12:00.594 --> 12:01.804
People...

12:02.722 --> 12:03.889
they're coming.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.383
Show me your face.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.553
Show me your ID.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.388
What's in there?

12:46.849 --> 12:47.933
Show me.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.070
They are searching for him.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.072
They are searching for him.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.200
He has escaped!

13:06.160 --> 13:07.244
He has escaped!

13:10.456 --> 13:12.249
He has escaped!

13:14.293 --> 13:15.711
He has escaped!

15:25.633 --> 15:29.345
I'm not being paranoid.
Listen to me, Alon... I'm being set up.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.138
I don't know why.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.015
The Americans are involved now...

15:41.273 --> 15:42.566
I'll call you later.

16:06.423 --> 16:09.551
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>

16:09.635 --> 16:12.471
<i>My little girl</i>

16:13.055 --> 16:17.226
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>

16:20.312 --> 16:21.605
How's my girl?

16:27.736 --> 16:29.738
Does Mika know you're taking Ellie?

16:33.033 --> 16:34.118
She's my daughter.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.327
Ido.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.917
Is this your favorite doll?

16:43.085 --> 16:44.003
Yes.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.421
Little Red Riding Hood?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.966
Because she has a little red riding hood!

16:49.049 --> 16:51.885
So she is Little Red Riding Hood!

16:57.891 --> 16:59.184
Daddy's a pig.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.189
That's what Mamma says.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.525
That's what Mamma says?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.194
Yes.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.466
Can you wait in the car for me?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.176
I don't want to be alone.

17:32.801 --> 17:33.635
Just stay here...

17:34.762 --> 17:36.722
I'm going to get you an ice cream.

17:37.931 --> 17:38.932
Daddy...

17:42.269 --> 17:43.395
Daddy...

18:51.839 --> 18:53.173
It's him.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.366
For centuries...

19:21.410 --> 19:24.580
these steps have been stained
with the blood of brother for brother.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.582
And none of it pleased God.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.041
How could it?

19:28.876 --> 19:33.338
This soil we stand on...
is supposed to represent unity.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.009
It can no longer divide men.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.344
That day has passed.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.055
History has ended.

19:44.057 --> 19:47.144
The scriptures say that on judgment day,

19:47.227 --> 19:51.231
a set of scales
will be hung from these arches,

19:52.900 --> 19:54.526
to weigh all souls.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.823
What if I told you that day is here?

19:59.907 --> 20:03.535
A day where there is no more
bargaining with God,

20:04.453 --> 20:07.456
"when no soul will suffice
for another soul."

20:07.539 --> 20:10.876
Just you and your God...

20:11.960 --> 20:13.253
and your deeds.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.338
All of them.

20:16.131 --> 20:20.010
Who of you has done what
God has truly asked?

20:20.636 --> 20:23.013
Who of you could step forward...

20:23.096 --> 20:24.389
and weigh his soul?

20:26.516 --> 20:28.268
Step forward...

20:29.645 --> 20:31.355
and it will begin.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.323
Step forward...

20:42.574 --> 20:44.076
and it will begin.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.602
Get down! Get down!

21:12.729 --> 21:14.064
Out of the way!

21:15.899 --> 21:17.067
Everybody get down!

21:18.944 --> 21:20.362
Don't move!

21:21.029 --> 21:21.947
Stand back!

21:22.906 --> 21:24.116
That's him!

21:24.783 --> 21:25.617
Hands up!

21:26.159 --> 21:27.411
I said hands up!

21:43.635 --> 21:44.970
Hold fire!

21:45.053 --> 21:45.887
Who fired?

21:48.098 --> 21:49.599
You've shot a boy!

21:50.100 --> 21:51.101
Get off our land!

21:51.810 --> 21:54.438
Pigs! Murderers!

21:56.189 --> 21:58.483
Get off our land, it's not yours!

21:58.567 --> 22:00.819
Murderers! You've killed a child!

22:23.550 --> 22:24.926
I can't believe it!

22:46.990 --> 22:47.991
He's alive!

22:49.117 --> 22:50.285
How?

22:53.121 --> 22:54.122
It's a miracle!

22:59.127 --> 23:00.253
Stand back!

23:00.921 --> 23:01.963
Get back!

23:02.714 --> 23:03.965
Where is he?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.468
Where did he go?

23:07.511 --> 23:08.804
You're alive! It's a miracle!

23:08.887 --> 23:11.223
-Tell them!
-I'm alive!<i> </i>I'm alive!

23:14.059 --> 23:15.310
It's a miracle!

24:02.607 --> 24:05.193
<i>We have breaking news.</i>

24:05.277 --> 24:07.279
<i>There has been a shooting at Temple Mount.</i>

24:07.362 --> 24:09.448
<i>Details are still coming in.</i>

24:09.531 --> 24:12.200
<i>People are being told  to</i>
<i>stay away from the area.</i>

24:12.284 --> 24:13.493
Turn that up, please.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.911
<i>several shots have been fired</i>
<i>at Temple Mount...</i>

24:14.995 --> 24:18.081
<i>Early reports say the gunfire</i>
<i>was from Israeli police </i>

24:18.165 --> 24:19.833
<i>in pursuit of a suspect...</i>

24:19.916 --> 24:22.085
-I need to go there.
-What?

24:22.169 --> 24:23.795
Take me to Temple Mount.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.887
I can't, they're saying to stay away.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.180
I'll pay you.

26:18.535 --> 26:22.455
<i>This soil we stand on</i>
<i>is supposed to represent unity.</i>

26:23.832 --> 26:25.750
<i>It can no longer divide men. </i>

26:26.835 --> 26:28.253
<i>That day has passed.</i>

26:29.671 --> 26:30.964
<i>History has ended.</i>

26:31.798 --> 26:34.259
These words cannot be tolerated.

26:34.342 --> 26:37.220
But he's brought energy
to the cause, Imam.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.389
Israel is under great pressure
because of him.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.558
He gives a voice to our struggle--

26:41.641 --> 26:44.686
He misquotes Muhammad.

26:44.769 --> 26:48.148
This man is a heretic, not a prophet.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.984
But he appeared in Damascus
in a yellow robe...

26:51.067 --> 26:52.485
as the scriptures said.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.238
Any man can wear a yellow robe.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.164
If he has escaped...

27:05.081 --> 27:06.916
why hasn't he come back to us?

27:10.003 --> 27:11.880
If he really is Isa returned,

27:13.506 --> 27:16.426
then he has greater things to worry about.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.597
-He has left us.
-He wouldn't do that.

27:20.972 --> 27:25.352
We must be faithful and not act
out of foolish despair.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.604
He turned away Daesh,

27:28.647 --> 27:30.815
and he will provide for us again...

30:14.562 --> 30:16.022
What? What is it?

30:16.648 --> 30:19.275
You want to tell me why you left
our daughter in the car today?

30:19.359 --> 30:20.610
It was for two minutes.

30:20.693 --> 30:22.070
<i>She said you had a gun.</i>

33:20.623 --> 33:22.041
What are you doing here?

33:25.128 --> 33:26.254
What are you doing?

33:26.963 --> 33:28.631
We're looking for the
people that live here.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.883
It's the middle of the night.
Don't you have any decency?

33:31.300 --> 33:33.636
You cut off our electricity!
You send in soldiers!

33:33.720 --> 33:35.263
We're not Israelis!

33:35.346 --> 33:37.140
We're reporters.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.934
Is this where the little boy
from Al-Aqsa lives?

33:40.018 --> 33:42.061
-He's gone.
-When did he leave?

33:42.145 --> 33:44.564
-Today. He's not coming back.
-Where did they go?

33:45.106 --> 33:47.066
Why have you come in
the middle of the night?

33:47.150 --> 33:48.526
Listen.

33:48.609 --> 33:51.654
We don't want any trouble.
We just want to talk.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.741
They are finished talking.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.409
That's why they left.

33:56.492 --> 33:57.744
What do you mean?

33:57.827 --> 33:58.745
Listen.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.790
The boy has been touched by God.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.547
Today this street was filled with
people who wanted to touch him.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.468
They are safer where they are.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.178
Who took them?

34:20.349 --> 34:21.559
Who took them?

37:53.396 --> 37:54.397
Here!

37:57.775 --> 37:58.859
Come closer.

38:00.695 --> 38:01.821
Are you hungry?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.493
Do you want some bread?

38:15.751 --> 38:17.044
We have more...

38:17.545 --> 38:18.462
much more.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.506
Thank you.

38:22.216 --> 38:23.968
We're going to get you all out.

38:26.637 --> 38:27.805
Go!

38:29.390 --> 38:30.725
Tell the elders!

38:33.519 --> 38:34.645
Hurry!
