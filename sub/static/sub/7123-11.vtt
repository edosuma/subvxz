Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:34.334 --> 00:35.164
Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:36.236 --> 00:37.430
Hup!

00:40.073 --> 00:42.166
Fire the laser cannon!

00:43.376 --> 00:44.900
Aah!

00:44.978 --> 00:46.104
Good job, girl!

00:46.179 --> 00:47.646
Have some spaghetti!

00:47.714 --> 00:48.612
Thanks.

00:48.681 --> 00:50.171
Oh, no! Ha!

00:50.250 --> 00:51.683
Too bad I'm a
really strong guy

00:51.751 --> 00:54.117
and I took my doctor
pills this morning!

00:54.187 --> 00:55.552
Lasers don't hurt me!

00:59.659 --> 01:00.853
Next time.

01:00.927 --> 01:02.155
Hmph!

01:02.228 --> 01:04.992
Give us the Enchiridion!

01:06.633 --> 01:07.793
Thanks.

01:07.867 --> 01:08.765
That's not a book!

01:08.835 --> 01:09.665
It's a bomb!

01:11.204 --> 01:12.466
Yah!

01:14.407 --> 01:17.171
Hyah!

01:17.243 --> 01:19.837
You've been acting like a
real knucklehead, Dr. Prince!

01:19.913 --> 01:21.380
Go on! Get out of here!

01:21.448 --> 01:23.814
And don't ever do
wrong things again!

01:23.883 --> 01:24.850
You're right.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.783
I see your side of things.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.522
You saved the day,
mega-rad-cool-guy.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.616
What's your name?

01:33.693 --> 01:35.126
Oh, Ice King.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.685
I'm such a great guy!

01:36.763 --> 01:38.355
This book is yours.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.659
The Enchiridion!

01:39.732 --> 01:41.996
I want to be your best
and closest friend.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.662
Let's have a best and
closest friend lunch!

01:44.737 --> 01:46.568
It's mac and cheezles.

01:46.639 --> 01:47.833
Aww.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.238
- What a sweetie.
- What a good guy.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.209
I'm just so glad you
guys are real.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.268
You're really, really real.

01:54.647 --> 01:58.276
I want to remember
this day forever.

01:58.351 --> 02:00.012
Don't be sad, Ice King.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.713
We're going on a
space adventure!

02:01.788 --> 02:03.119
Hop on, baby.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.281
Wee!

02:04.357 --> 02:07.053
Here we go!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.651
Ice King, stop! Please!

02:08.728 --> 02:10.127
This story is terrible!

02:10.196 --> 02:11.163
Huh? What?

02:11.231 --> 02:12.391
I can't follow anything.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.295
I mean, where are we going?

02:14.267 --> 02:15.325
I don't even understand.

02:15.401 --> 02:18.370
Maybe the story is a
new form of torture!

02:18.438 --> 02:19.632
Oh, come on!

02:19.706 --> 02:21.139
It's a first draft!

02:21.207 --> 02:22.299
Don't hate.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.070
And besides, that story
had everything...

02:24.144 --> 02:27.671
Action, adventure,
a hotter older guy.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.009
Wild Berry, don't pretend.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.050
I know you like the
silver foxes.

02:36.789 --> 02:38.848
What if it were a little
more like real life?

02:38.925 --> 02:39.983
Real?

02:40.059 --> 02:42.220
It's based on the real
Fionna and Cake!

02:42.295 --> 02:44.991
Yeah, but what if there was a
little more romance in the story?

02:45.064 --> 02:46.725
Romance is a great idea!

02:46.799 --> 02:48.926
Y'all are just
hatin' on my steez!

02:49.002 --> 02:50.401
I'm not listening to haters!

02:50.470 --> 02:51.630
Haters!

02:51.704 --> 02:53.865
Whoa! What the...

02:53.940 --> 02:56.431
Whoa.

02:56.509 --> 02:59.501
We're free!

02:59.579 --> 03:01.911
I'm sorry I didn't
think you were real, Gob!

03:01.981 --> 03:03.642
But now I've
seen your power,

03:03.716 --> 03:06.378
and I've got some things I did
that I have to say sorry for.

03:06.452 --> 03:07.282
Boo.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.243
Marceline!

03:09.322 --> 03:10.516
How long have
you been in here?

03:10.590 --> 03:12.421
Oh, a couple hours?

03:12.492 --> 03:14.221
Oh, you heard
my story, then.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.784
Awesome, right?

03:15.862 --> 03:20.595
It's good, but maybe it's
time to let someone else try.

03:22.535 --> 03:23.934
Listen up, y'all.

03:24.003 --> 03:26.062
I've got a
story of my own.

03:26.139 --> 03:29.040
Yah! Yah!

03:29.108 --> 03:30.336
Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!

03:30.410 --> 03:31.775
Woo! Woo! Woo!

03:31.844 --> 03:32.833
Yah!

03:36.516 --> 03:38.279
Woo! Nice throw!

03:38.351 --> 03:39.283
Thanks.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.649
I've got to do
something today.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.086
What about Gumball's mission
we went on this morning?

03:43.156 --> 03:45.090
Delivering daisy chains
to the Fluffy people

03:45.158 --> 03:46.352
not enough for you?

03:46.426 --> 03:49.452
Uh, sometimes Gumball's
missions can be so...

03:49.529 --> 03:50.621
lame.

03:50.697 --> 03:51.721
Rah!

03:51.798 --> 03:53.288
Hello, every...

03:54.801 --> 03:55.995
Oh, my.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.800
Looks like you almost
skronked up my dome-piece.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.703
Boy, have I got a
treat for you two!

04:01.774 --> 04:04.174
The fluffy people and I baked
these in appreciation for the

04:04.244 --> 04:05.404
mission you've completed.

04:05.478 --> 04:06.740
They're cream puffs.

04:06.813 --> 04:07.745
Try one.

04:07.814 --> 04:10.783
Uh, I'd love to,
but maybe later.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.877
What was that?

04:15.288 --> 04:17.415
Uh! Aww.

04:18.491 --> 04:19.958
Something's on the roof!
Come on!

04:20.026 --> 04:20.890
I'm not going out there.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.552
It's wet.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.893
Uh, it is wet.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.227
Oh, it's just him.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.034
Oh. Hey, Fionna.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.233
Marshall Lee!

04:35.308 --> 04:36.366
Ahem.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.568
Oh, forgive me!

04:38.645 --> 04:40.237
Hello, your Majesty!

04:42.649 --> 04:44.913
Fionna, take me back inside.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.077
What? Is he kidding?

04:48.421 --> 04:49.581
Hey! Oh, honestly!

04:49.656 --> 04:50.953
I'm going in.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.720
Come join me when you
want more <i>polite</i> company.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.385
Be careful!

04:55.461 --> 04:57.053
Whoa!

04:57.130 --> 04:58.119
You got it!

04:59.132 --> 05:00.497
What a wad.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.830
Uh, a gum wad?

05:02.902 --> 05:04.597
Fionna!

05:05.705 --> 05:06.672
Let's ditch him.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.002
Uhh...

05:09.075 --> 05:11.100
Lumpy Space Prince is
throwing a party in the woods.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.838
It's gonna be
freaky nasty.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.402
Uhh...

05:14.480 --> 05:16.914
I know you're going to say
"Yes" to me, so let's just go.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.883
Whooaaaaaa!

05:34.233 --> 05:35.996
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

05:36.069 --> 05:37.434
Oh, my God!

05:37.503 --> 05:39.300
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.033
Oh, you're bumping into me!

05:44.077 --> 05:45.442
This looks fun.
Bunch.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.443
Come on.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.638
You guys!

05:47.714 --> 05:50.376
Marshall Lee is gonna
play a song, you guys!

05:57.757 --> 06:00.157

07:56.642 --> 07:57.836
Yeah.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.842

08:05.485 --> 08:07.316
Fionna, lighten up!

08:07.386 --> 08:09.013
Look, I don't care if
you're being a jerk to me,

08:09.088 --> 08:11.579
but nobody messes with Cake.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.215
Oh, really?!

08:13.292 --> 08:14.759
Well, what if I just take
her right now, you know?

08:14.827 --> 08:15.919
Meep!

08:15.995 --> 08:16.927
What?!

08:16.996 --> 08:17.985
Unexpected!

08:18.998 --> 08:20.397
Marshall!

08:23.369 --> 08:24.700
Cake!

08:24.770 --> 08:26.032
You want your Cake back?

08:26.105 --> 08:28.630
Come... and... get her!

08:36.148 --> 08:37.445
Did you think I was lying?

08:37.517 --> 08:41.078
I said I'm evil without even
trying, already dead,

08:41.153 --> 08:42.450
so I'm not scared of dying.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.547
Drinking the red from
your heart in one sitting.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.888
You think you've got me pegged,
you must be kidding.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.223
I raise the dead up,
and they do my bidding.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.695
Girl, I'm a thousand years old,
I'm a riddle.

08:51.764 --> 08:52.890
"Bad little boy."

08:52.965 --> 08:54.432
Yes, I'm bad,
but not little.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.400
Unh-unh, boy.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.458
What are you thinking?

09:06.979 --> 09:07.809
Fionna!

09:07.880 --> 09:08.812
Cake!

09:08.881 --> 09:10.473
Grab on to my little paws!

09:14.186 --> 09:15.915
- Oof!
- Aah!

09:15.988 --> 09:18.821
Marshall?

09:22.962 --> 09:24.793
Oh, this is bad, guys.

09:24.864 --> 09:26.024
This is really bad.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.190
Marshall!

09:28.301 --> 09:29.199
Ah!

09:29.268 --> 09:30.132
Come on.

09:30.202 --> 09:31.134
You gotta be okay.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.705
I think this is it for me,
Fionna.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.241
So, why don't you
just admit it?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.209
You're in love with me.

09:40.112 --> 09:42.239
I... I get that you flirt
with me all the time,

09:42.315 --> 09:43.714
and it's funny
and whatever,

09:43.783 --> 09:45.444
but you're doing
that <i>now?!</i>

09:45.518 --> 09:47.383
What are you trying
to do to my head?!

09:47.453 --> 09:49.250
You think I've got
some little crush on you?!

09:49.322 --> 09:53.452
Well, for however long
we've got left...

09:53.526 --> 09:55.221
For once drop it,
you freak!

09:57.163 --> 09:58.494
Faking it. Faking it.

09:58.564 --> 10:00.156
Okay, my shirt is, like,
filled with cream puffs.

10:00.232 --> 10:01.563
Oh, goodness.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.192
Glob, Fionna.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.169
You're like the realest
person I've ever met.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.503
Ow! Oh, my cheek meat!

10:08.574 --> 10:09.472
Quit clowning, Fionna.

10:10.710 --> 10:11.870
Fionna?

10:11.944 --> 10:13.241
Fionna!

10:13.312 --> 10:14.142
The end.

10:14.213 --> 10:15.737
Oh, I love that one.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.214
Oh, come on!

10:17.283 --> 10:20.377
You guys got mad at
<i>me</i> for a bad story?!

10:20.453 --> 10:23.445
I mean, it's cute,
but that's not how they'd be.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.755
Well, look, it might not be too
late to polish this piece of...

10:27.827 --> 10:29.385
Let's spitball some ideas.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.192
Like, if Marshall Lee
gets sick and dies.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.789
But he's got a brother
we didn't know about.

10:34.867 --> 10:38.166
His name's Marshall Lee... Roy.

10:38.237 --> 10:39.067
Boom!

10:39.138 --> 10:40.435
Shocker!

10:40.506 --> 10:42.872
Ah-ha, I feel goose bumps.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.570
- I like how it is.
- We like how it is.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.203
- Yeah, don't change it.
- Yeah. It's good.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.406
Everyone get out.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.882
Maybe we could start a
writing group or whatever.

11:03.129 --> 11:05.597
I know you're out
there somewhere.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.929
I just haven't figured
out how to get to you,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.197
but, believe me, I will.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.828
I will.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.913
