00:58.266 --> 01:00.100
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY.

01:00.268 --> 01:03.020
PERSONS LIKE JOE KAGAN
HAVE THEIR OWN RELIGION.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.856
THEY HAVE THEIR
AFRICAN WITCH DOCTORS

01:06.024 --> 01:07.399
AND THEIR VOODOO DRUMS.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.693
MRS. OLESON, JOE
KAGAN'S FAMILY HAS
BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY

01:09.861 --> 01:11.779
LONGER THAN YOURS--
180 YEARS.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.406
HE'S A GOOD CHRISTIAN.
HE'D LIKE TO PRACTICE
HIS RELIGION

01:14.574 --> 01:16.200
WITH THE MEMBERS
OF HIS COMMUNITY.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.703
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF
MR. KAGAN'S APPLICATION
FOR MEMBERSHIP,

01:19.871 --> 01:22.873
PLEASE SIGNIFY BY
RAISING YOUR RIGHT HAND.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.466
IT'S A STANDOFF.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.344
Harriet: WELL, I GUESS THAT
SETTLES THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.970
WAIT A MINUTE,
HARRIET.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.264
ALL THE VOTES
AREN'T IN YET.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.061
THE AYES HAVE IT!

01:44.229 --> 01:47.481
I HATE TO INTERRUPT
YOUR CLASS,

01:47.649 --> 01:51.735
BUT I HAVE SOME NEWS
THAT CONCERNS YOU ALL.

01:51.903 --> 01:56.824
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE MOST DIFFICULT THING
I EVER HAD TO DO IN MY LIFE,

01:56.991 --> 02:02.287
BUT AS SOME OF YOU KNOW,
OUR SCHOOL BUILDING
IS OWNED BY THE CHURCH,

02:02.455 --> 02:06.083
AND THE DEACONS HAVE
GENEROUSLY PERMITTED US
TO OCCUPY IT RENT-FREE,

02:06.251 --> 02:11.755
BUT NOW THE CHURCH
IS IN DESPERATE NEED
OF MONEY TO SUSTAIN ITSELF.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.383
THEY'VE SOLD THE PROPERTY.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.218
I HATE TO SAY THIS,

02:16.386 --> 02:20.931
BUT I'M AFRAID IT MEANS
THE END OF THE WINOKA
ACADEMY FOR THE BLIND.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.685
NOW, I WANTED CHARLES
TO MAKE CLEAR PRECISELY
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS

02:24.853 --> 02:26.520
BECAUSE I THINK
WE HERE IN WALNUT GROVE

02:26.688 --> 02:30.232
MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE
AN ANSWER, A WAY TO
HELP THOSE CHILDREN.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.110

THAT THE LATE

02:33.278 --> 02:36.822

[COCKS RIFLE]
Hester Sue:
SOMETHING YOU WANTED?

16:34.868 --> 16:36.452
WHAT'S THE RIFLE FOR?

16:36.620 --> 16:39.288
I THINK THEY CALL
IT SELF-DEFENSE.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.873
AIN'T NO SAVAGES
AROUND HERE, WOMAN.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.793
THAT REMAINS TO
BE SEEN, MR. KAGAN.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.588
WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D JUST COME BY
BEFORE I TURN IN

16:47.756 --> 16:50.008
TO SEE IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO
FOR YOU.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.635
SUCH AS?

16:52.803 --> 16:56.973
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU NAME IT.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.809
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL NAME IT.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.729
AS I'VE STATED
BEFORE, MR. KAGAN,

17:02.896 --> 17:06.607
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!

17:09.570 --> 17:12.572
I THINK MAYBE SHE'S TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.418
WELL, HESTER SUE
SURE GOT A LOT
OF DIGNITY.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.919
TOO MUCH.

17:30.799 --> 17:34.719
[THUNDER]

17:46.732 --> 17:48.566
STILL NOT
ASLEEP, SON?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.860
I'VE BEEN WONDERING.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.403
WONDERING
ABOUT WHAT?

17:52.571 --> 17:56.157
MRS. OLESON. SHE'S ALWAYS
SAYING SHE'S MY BENEFACTOR.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.702
WHAT'S A BENEFACTOR?

17:59.870 --> 18:01.454
WELL, SON, THAT'S A...

18:01.622 --> 18:06.250
PERSON WHO DOES
GOOD FOR SOMEBODY
IN NEED OF HELP.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.337
WHAT'S SHE DONE GOOD?

18:09.505 --> 18:13.382
SHE SPENT A LOT OF
MONEY HELPING TO FIX UP
YOUR NEW SCHOOL.

18:15.761 --> 18:20.556
THEN I GUESS SHE'S
A NICE LADY, BUT
SHE'S NOT NICE TO ME.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.558
SHE DON'T LIKE ME.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.228
SHE DON'T LIKE
YOU NEITHER.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.022
YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

18:28.190 --> 18:32.443
WHY? WHAT DID
WE DO TO HER?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.529
NOTHING.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.990
TO HER, WE JUST AIN'T
THE RIGHT COLOR.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.287
WHAT'S THE RIGHT COLOR?

18:43.455 --> 18:47.583
Joe: HER COLOR,
ACCORDING TO HER. WHITE.

18:47.751 --> 18:51.420
WE JUST HAPPEN
TO BE BLACK.

18:51.588 --> 18:56.801
WELL, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE?

18:56.969 --> 19:01.097
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
EITHER ONE, HAVE YOU?

19:01.265 --> 19:04.976
WELL, SAMSON, THEY'RE
JUST TWO DIFFERENT
COLORS, THAT'S ALL.

THEIR HEAD IT'S ALL THE
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD.

THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT'S
DIFFERENT FROM THEM?

19:14.111 --> 19:17.321
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

19:17.489 --> 19:22.827
MAYBE FOLKS WOULD BE
NICER TO OTHER FOLKS
IF THEY NEVER SAW ANYTHING.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.331
YOU KNOW, SAMSON,

19:27.499 --> 19:31.627
YOU GOT MORE VISION
THAN SOME FOLKS
WITH TWO GOOD EYES.

A SIN TO TELL A LIE,

JUST SAID YOUR PRAYERS.

CAN'T I STAY UP
UNTIL MA COMES HOME?

MM-HMM.

BACK FROM THE GARVEYS'
TILL REAL LATE,

WHAT DO YOU
MEAN SUPPOSE?

AND CHORES BOTH.

SURE WOULDN'T WANT TO
DO IT ALL YEAR ROUND.

FASTER.

A CUP FOR YOU.

21:29.746 --> 21:32.999
TAKE THAT PIPE
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH
THIS MINUTE!

21:33.166 --> 21:36.752
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A MAN ENJOYING
HIS PIPE AFTER A HARD DAY.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.755
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
A MAN, AND THAT'S
NOT YOUR PIPE.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.507
PA WOULDN'T MIND.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.634

NOT MY MA, AND YOU CAN'T
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

AND SMOKE THE PIPE,

BEFORE MA COMES HOME

IS GOING TO GET
A WHIPPING.

HOW DO I LOOK
WITH A PIPE?

22:07.326 --> 22:11.704
SAME AS I'D LOOK--SILLY.

YEAH, YOU LOOK
AT LEAST 10.

22:18.962 --> 22:22.089
I AM 10.

BESIDES, PA SAYS THERE'S
NO NEED TO ACT GROWN UP.

22:29.765 --> 22:33.559
IT WILL HAPPEN
SOON ENOUGH ANYWAY.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.061
I DON'T SEE WHY ANYONE

22:35.228 --> 22:37.146
WOULD WANT TO GO
LIGHTING LEAVES
AND PUFFING ON THEM.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.190
IT WOULD BE THE SAME
THING AS CLIMBING UP
ON THE ROOF

OLDER, BUT YOU SURE

THAT I DON'T THINK THAT
THERE IS ANY SUCH THING

24:05.944 --> 24:08.779
AS A RIGHT COLOR
OR A WRONG COLOR
FOR THAT MATTER,

24:08.947 --> 24:11.407
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT

24:11.575 --> 24:14.910
THAT IT'S WHAT'S INSIDE
A PERSON THAT COUNTS.

24:15.078 --> 24:19.373

IN COMMON, MRS. OLESON.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.836
YES'M. I ALWAYS
SAY THAT MYSELF.

HURT YOURSELF.

FROM SLEEPING
ON THAT COUCH.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.000
IT'S ABOUT A FOOT
TOO SHORT FOR THIS
FRAME OF MINE.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.003

THAT BEDROOM SET OF YOURS
LOOKS MIGHTY FINE

25:48.171 --> 25:50.256
IN MRS. TERHUNE'S BEDROOM.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.674
WONDERFUL.

25:51.841 --> 25:54.760
I HOPE YOU DON'T
NEED ANY MORE NAILS.

25:54.928 --> 25:55.970
THOSE ARE
MY LAST ONES.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.596
NO, I THINK
THAT WILL
ABOUT DO IT.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.848
I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ANY MONEY

26:00.016 --> 26:03.352
GIVING AWAY
ALL THESE MATERIALS
TO THE BLIND SCHOOL.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.438
IT'S FOR CHARITY,
HARRIET--ER, NELLIE.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.357
WELL, I AGREE WITH
WHAT MOTHER SAID.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.735
CHARITY SHOULD
BEGIN AT HOME.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.280
HOW'S IT GOING OVER
AT THE SCHOOL, JONATHAN?

26:14.447 --> 26:17.241
OH, FINE. ANOTHER COUPLE
OF DAYS, AND WE'LL HAVE
IT SHIPSHAPE,

KIDS TO MOVE IN.

PROBABLY MISSING

THE TRUTH, IT HAS BEEN
KIND OF QUIET AROUND HERE.

26:26.418 --> 26:30.254
AND WITH NELLIE
COOKING, EVERY MEAL
IS A BURNT OFFERING.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.548
THAT'S A TERRIBLE
THING TO SAY ABOUT
YOUR DAUGHTER!

26:32.716 --> 26:35.301
WELL, IT'S NOT
SO TERRIBLE
IF IT'S THE TRUTH.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.350
WHOA.

26:43.518 --> 26:46.687
GOT A FREIGHT DELIVERY HERE
FOR MRS. HARRIET OLESON.

26:46.855 --> 26:50.107
OH, THAT MUST BE
THAT THING
HARRIET ORDERED.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.359
YEAH, THIS
IS THE PLACE.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.361
A PLAQUE FROM
THE CURRY BRONZE WORKS.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.740
THAT ONE ON THE END.

26:57.907 --> 27:01.285
THIS IS THE LITTLE
PLAQUE THAT SHE ORDERED?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.829
LOOKS MORE LIKE
A MONUMENT!

27:03.997 --> 27:05.706
YEAH, A NATIONAL
MONUMENT.

MADE A MISTAKE HERE.

YOUR BILL OF LADING.

LISTEN, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DELIVERED TO THAT BIG HOUSE
ABOUT A COUPLE OF MILES--

27:19.888 --> 27:21.597
I WAS TOLD TO
DELIVER IT TO THE
OLESON MERCANTILE.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.891
THIS IS OLESON
MERCANTILE.
THAT'S YOUR PLAQUE.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.310
GET IT OFF OF HERE SO
I CAN KEEP MY SCHEDULE.

ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME A HAND.

27:27.979 --> 27:33.442

TO LOAD OR UNLOAD.

TO HELP YOU, NELS.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.462

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
PUT OUR BACKS TO THAT.

27:53.630 --> 27:54.797
GO!

27:54.964 --> 27:57.591
OHH! THIS MUST
WEIGH A TON!

27:57.759 --> 28:00.719
TOOK 6 MEN
TO LOAD IT.

28:00.887 --> 28:03.847

YOU A DOLLAR TO
GIVE US A HAND.

OH, I THINK I HURT
MYSELF THIS TIME.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.221
YOU WANT ME TO GET
DOC BAKER?

28:44.389 --> 28:46.348
I WISH HARRIET
WAS HERE RIGHT NOW.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.225
YOU MISS HER
THAT MUCH?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.731
I'D KILL HER.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.933
WELL, WHERE'S
THE FERRY?

29:30.101 --> 29:32.102

A GOOD QUESTION.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.202
IT LOOKS
REAL BAD.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.621
SURE IS. YOU BEST GET
THE KIDS OFF THE WAGON.

FERRY WENT DOWN
INSTEAD OF ACROSS.

I'M GOING TO TRY
IT FIRST, ALONE,
SEE HOW BAD IT IS.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.717
IF IT'S TOO BAD, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY
ACROSS ON THAT TOW LINE.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.803
WHY DON'T YOU SEE
IF WE HAVE THE MAKINGS
FOR A SLING CHAIR?

30:05.970 --> 30:07.012
RIGHT.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.430
BE CAREFUL, PA.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.307

CHANCE IT WITH THE CHILDREN!

OFF ME!

32:52.679 --> 32:53.971
I'M NOT GOING
ACROSS THIS--

32:54.138 --> 32:56.765
YOU HAVE TO!
ALL THE KIDS WENT
ACROSS JUST FINE.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.351
I DON'T CARE!
I'M NOT A KID, AND I'M
NOT GOING ACROSS THERE!
