12:31.170 --> 12:33.530
It doesn't matter
what you've done.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.670
- I don't do drugs, Uncle Billy.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.080
- I used to like to stand beside
my father when he pumped gas.

12:50.150 --> 12:53.050
- Whipped cream
has nitrous oxide.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.820
My mom had to stop buying it.

12:58.230 --> 13:01.330
- Only two of these girls have
admitted to using inhalants,

13:01.400 --> 13:04.130
and all that means
is we can rule it out.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.270
It wasn't Molly.

13:12.510 --> 13:14.440
If you use nail polish
often enough,

13:14.440 --> 13:16.810
that can mimic an inhalant.
- Yeah, Molly doesn't really

13:16.880 --> 13:19.650
paint her nails.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.350
- All these girls
use different make-up,

13:22.420 --> 13:24.390
different shampoos.
Their parents use different

13:24.450 --> 13:26.250
household cleaners.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.490
The only thing they have in
common is the fact that they are

13:28.560 --> 13:30.260
girls and that they
go to school.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.790
- The school was the first
place I checked.

13:32.860 --> 13:35.160
The environmental records
were spotless.

13:35.230 --> 13:37.530
- It has to be the school.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.530
- Then why would it
just affect the girls?

13:39.540 --> 13:41.940
I'm telling you... air, heat,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.140
water, they all came back clean.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.770
- What about the girls
locker room?

13:48.680 --> 13:50.950
- Billy! Answer your damn phone.

13:52.850 --> 13:54.620
- Give me a second.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.620
- Yeah.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.820
(door bell jingling)

14:09.160 --> 14:12.100
- You can't let them
send me to jail, Billy.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.970
- John, what happened?

14:18.310 --> 14:21.110
- The first thing you need to
know is that I did not do this.

14:30.550 --> 14:32.720
- OK. OK, relax. We'll...

14:32.790 --> 14:35.060
we'll figure this out.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.960
- This is just what we need.

14:40.030 --> 14:42.700
- Don't worry. I'll sort it out.
- He killed a dog.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.800
- He says he didn't do it.
- You believe him?

14:44.870 --> 14:46.670
- He's my friend.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.870
And my client.
- We don't have time for this.

14:49.870 --> 14:53.470
- He could lose his kid.
- He should've thought of
that before he killed the dog.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.340
- All right.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.180
What do you want me to do?
- We have to go double-check

14:57.250 --> 14:59.880
the school. We have 24 hours
to figure this out.

14:59.950 --> 15:01.880
- What are you talking about?

15:01.950 --> 15:03.820
- We have to pitch
my firm on this tomorrow.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.620
- That's not enough time.
- Well, it's all
the time I have.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.660
So you can go

15:09.730 --> 15:11.760
with him, but I have work to do.

15:11.830 --> 15:14.130
(tense music)

15:14.200 --> 15:16.900
♪♪♪

15:20.700 --> 15:22.740
- I'll be fine by next week.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.870
I can't... I can't
miss regionals.

15:25.940 --> 15:29.110
- You know your body best.

15:29.180 --> 15:31.380
- It's Jackson High.

15:31.380 --> 15:34.080
(door opening)

15:38.790 --> 15:40.750
- Time to go home.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.860
- I can walk.

15:42.920 --> 15:46.090
- They do this for everyone.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.640
- So if you find
what you're looking for,

16:03.710 --> 16:06.080
you're gonna sue the school?
- Not the school.

16:06.150 --> 16:07.910
The government
that runs the school.

16:07.980 --> 16:09.920
- Sounds like the same thing.
- It's not.

16:09.990 --> 16:11.750
- Ms. Evans?

16:11.820 --> 16:14.620
Can I speak to you?
- Is it an emergency?

16:14.620 --> 16:17.090
- No, it's... it can
totally wait.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.660
- OK. Meet me in my office
after school. OK, Allie?

16:19.730 --> 16:21.660
- OK.

16:27.970 --> 16:30.140
- I bring my kids to the gym on
the weekend when it's raining.

16:30.210 --> 16:32.870
Sarah always complained
about the smell.

16:32.940 --> 16:35.380
- Did they send someone to check
it out? Was it a certified

16:35.440 --> 16:37.580
microbial investigator?
- It was probably

16:37.650 --> 16:40.110
an unemployed plumber. This
school's barely staying open

16:40.180 --> 16:42.120
as it is.
- I saw a brand-new

16:42.180 --> 16:44.250
athletic field out back.
- Yeah. That's boys sports.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.720
The guys get a new turf field
and we get the old cow pasture.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.920
Life ain't fair.

16:48.990 --> 16:50.920
- This place hasn't
changed at all.

16:52.990 --> 16:54.930
- Here it is.

16:59.470 --> 17:01.800
My kids shower here.
Are they gonna get sick?

17:01.870 --> 17:03.970
- People react to substances
in different ways.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.069
Could be
a genetic predisposition,

17:06.079 --> 17:07.940
a hormonal reaction

17:08.010 --> 17:09.839
or an underlying condition.

17:09.910 --> 17:12.450
- So maybe.

17:12.510 --> 17:15.050
- We don't know
that this caused it.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.550
(sighing)

17:17.550 --> 17:19.550
Mould would likely

17:19.619 --> 17:21.960
show up in the lungs first.

17:22.020 --> 17:25.490
But we'll have
this tested anyway.

17:25.490 --> 17:27.930
The hardest thing with cases
like this is having to prove

17:28.000 --> 17:30.230
that this caused the twitching.

17:30.230 --> 17:32.800
If we can't prove that,

17:32.870 --> 17:34.970
then we don't have a case.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.140
- Ms. Evans?

17:37.140 --> 17:39.470
I don't think it
can wait, actually.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.480
It keeps happening.

17:43.550 --> 17:45.350
I can't make it stop.
- OK.

17:47.780 --> 17:49.880
OK.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.460
Allie was in my office a couple
of days ago, totally fine.

17:56.530 --> 17:59.660
- She was so scared.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.260
- We were just doing
applications to art school

18:02.330 --> 18:04.400
in New York.
- There's an explanation.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.670
Things like this don't
just happen out of nowhere.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.470
- How does she paint now?

18:08.540 --> 18:10.400
- It doesn't mean she's
not gonna get better,

18:10.410 --> 18:12.470
go to New York.
- I've known these kids

18:12.540 --> 18:14.740
since they were little, and now
I'm watching their lives

18:14.740 --> 18:16.740
fall apart.

18:16.810 --> 18:18.710
- You feel helpless.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.550
It's so weird,

18:24.550 --> 18:26.550
being back here like this.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.560
Everywhere I look,
something just

18:28.560 --> 18:30.720
seems off.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.130
Last time I was here, I was

18:36.200 --> 18:38.600
those girls' age. We were.

18:38.670 --> 18:40.570
And here we are now,

18:40.640 --> 18:42.570
the grownups.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.370
How did that happen?

18:45.440 --> 18:48.010
- I got married.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.980
Had two kids.

18:50.050 --> 18:53.650
Became the guidance counsellor
at the school I used to go to.

18:53.650 --> 18:55.580
Got divorced.

18:55.650 --> 18:57.450
And you...

18:57.450 --> 18:59.290
- Went to law school.

19:01.790 --> 19:04.830
- What about the rest of the 17
years since you've been gone?

19:14.940 --> 19:17.470
I'm glad you
came back, Joanna.

19:21.010 --> 19:22.880
- Yeah.

19:22.950 --> 19:25.950
I think I am too.

19:26.010 --> 19:28.420
- So what do we do now?

19:28.480 --> 19:30.680
- I'm gonna go talk to Billy

19:30.750 --> 19:32.850
and see if he's dug up
anything new about the girls.

19:45.030 --> 19:48.140
- Owen, he didn't kill the dog.
- He's driving around with it
in the back of his truck.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.840
How many times have you
threatened to kill him?

19:50.910 --> 19:52.710
- I never meant it. It's just...
it's something you say.

19:52.770 --> 19:54.770
- OK, John, just tell him
exactly what you told me.

19:54.780 --> 19:57.640
- I found him dying
on my front lawn.

19:57.650 --> 19:59.450
I tried to rescue him.

19:59.510 --> 20:01.650
- You're gonna have
to do better than that.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.780
- OK, you said that this
morning, Rocky was barking.

20:04.790 --> 20:08.660
- He barks all day, every day.
- Yes, but you said that

20:08.720 --> 20:10.920
this morning was different.
You saw him get off chain,

20:10.990 --> 20:12.960
start running around.
You said he seemed crazy.

20:13.030 --> 20:14.790
- Yeah, like he was on meth
or something.

20:14.860 --> 20:18.230
- Then you saw him run
towards the farm.
- Southvale Farms?

20:18.230 --> 20:20.970
- That's right. He could still
hear him barking. Probably

20:21.040 --> 20:22.340
driving the cows nuts.
- From my porch, I could see him

20:22.400 --> 20:25.140
tearing across towards the
school, zig-zagging everywhere.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.740
- An hour later, you saw him
come out from the trees

20:27.810 --> 20:30.480
by the school. You said
he was shaking,

20:30.550 --> 20:32.980
panting, foaming at the mouth.
Then he just keeled over.

20:33.050 --> 20:36.750
- I put him in my truck. I was
trying to take him to the vet.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.020
He was alive when I
put him in my truck.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.620
- See? Just a misunderstanding.

20:41.690 --> 20:43.920
He was trying
to do the right thing.

20:43.990 --> 20:46.230
- You ever go over to Southvale?

20:46.230 --> 20:48.830
- We share a fence.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.560
- Southvale got big
after it was sold.

20:51.570 --> 20:54.570
Big corporate operation
right on your doorstep.

20:54.570 --> 20:57.440
Maybe you don't like
the noise, the smell.

20:57.510 --> 21:00.170
- What are you talking about?
- Foaming at the mouth,

21:00.180 --> 21:02.210
disoriented, tremors.
A bunch of cows

21:02.280 --> 21:04.080
at Southvale died the same way.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.550
What, you got a problem
with them too?

21:06.610 --> 21:08.450
- Look, my client
didn't do anything wrong.

21:08.450 --> 21:11.850
- I didn't kill any cows, and I
didn't kill the dog.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.850
- Then how do you explain
everything around you that's

21:13.860 --> 21:16.390
living seems to be dying?
I gotta move on this, Billy.

21:16.460 --> 21:19.090
- Look, if you arrest him,

21:19.160 --> 21:21.430
he'll lose custody.
Just give him a chance.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.360
- Yeah, I think we're
all out of chances.

21:23.430 --> 21:25.570
- You know what? Let me look
into Southvale, all right?

21:25.630 --> 21:27.470
Just give me 24 hours.

21:31.170 --> 21:34.140
Owen, please.

21:34.140 --> 21:36.280
- You got one day, Billy.

21:36.340 --> 21:38.140
That's it.

21:41.180 --> 21:46.720
(door bell jingling)

21:46.790 --> 21:48.620
- Joanna, it's me.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.090
Can you meet me
at Southvale Farms?

21:51.090 --> 21:53.290
(mooing)

21:53.360 --> 21:55.430
(birds chirping)

21:55.500 --> 21:57.900
- It's been an awful year.

21:57.970 --> 21:59.970
I'm not gonna pretend otherwise.

22:00.040 --> 22:03.440
I know these cows better
than I know myself, but...

22:03.510 --> 22:05.270
they kept getting sick
and for the life of me,

22:05.340 --> 22:08.240
I couldn't figure out why.
- You lost six this year?

22:08.310 --> 22:10.980
- We noticed we were going
through a lot less feed.

22:11.050 --> 22:13.480
You want your cows to fatten up

22:13.550 --> 22:15.480
and they were losing weight.

22:15.550 --> 22:18.080
And then, the loss of balance.
Motor control.

22:18.150 --> 22:21.120
- Mad cow?
- That's what we thought.

22:21.190 --> 22:23.590
We tested. Negative.

22:26.090 --> 22:28.290
The company writes it off
as spillage,

22:28.360 --> 22:30.860
but I'm the one that has
to watch them die.

22:30.930 --> 22:34.130
- The police think someone's
been poisoning them?

22:36.140 --> 22:39.410
- When there were sick cows,
I suspected a competitor...

22:39.470 --> 22:41.980
but none of our animals
calved this year.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.610
- No pregnancies?
- All stillborn.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.220
- I used to play with Amy McEwan
on this farm after school.

22:50.220 --> 22:52.420
It was nothing
but cow pasture back then.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.740

24:53.810 --> 24:55.610

24:55.680 --> 24:57.480
They're testing it now.

24:57.550 --> 25:00.610
- The school did this?
We did this?

25:00.680 --> 25:02.680
- We'll know more once we
get the results.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.020
And it doesn't mean
the school's at fault.

25:05.090 --> 25:07.150

He's taking her to the hospital

25:14.960 --> 25:17.960

as the other girls.

25:18.030 --> 25:20.970

wants to press charges.

25:23.510 --> 25:26.370
dead animal,
poisons in his truck...

Hi, Diane. Haven't

25:46.560 --> 25:48.830

25:52.930 --> 25:55.340

as "spillage."

25:55.400 --> 25:57.870
The only farms who consider
dead cows spillage...

25:57.940 --> 25:59.910

Millwood, but it's a subsidiary

27:05.670 --> 27:07.470

Annual earnings of over...
$600 million.

27:10.210 --> 27:12.150
- Ooh!
- The soil sample from the field

27:12.150 --> 27:15.020
came back positive
for 16 chemical compounds.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.220
The highest concentration

27:17.290 --> 27:19.290
is for benzene. What's that?

27:19.350 --> 27:22.160
- Benzene is the sweet-smelling
part in gasoline.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.320
- Farms use a lot of gasoline.

27:26.230 --> 27:28.090
OK. Um...

27:28.160 --> 27:30.360
the farm had a spill...

27:30.430 --> 27:32.870
and it was too costly
to clean up,

27:32.930 --> 27:34.800
so they donated the land
to the school.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.700
- It would explain our symptoms.

27:36.770 --> 27:39.810
If the chemical was
coming up from the soil,

27:39.870 --> 27:41.780

27:56.660 --> 27:59.260

27:59.260 --> 28:01.530
Benzene's only

28:01.600 --> 28:03.660
0.6% of gasoline.

28:03.730 --> 28:06.030
- So there would've
had to have been

28:06.100 --> 28:08.200
a massive spill
to have these levels.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.670
Farms don't have that much fuel.

28:10.670 --> 28:12.940
If the spill

28:13.010 --> 28:14.870

the groundwater from somewhere.

Factory. Dry cleaner.

cleaner in the industrial park.
They do pretty big business.

28:27.420 --> 28:29.390
- What about manufacturers?

28:29.460 --> 28:33.090
- McMahon Rubber.
They make tires.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.230

35:52.900 --> 35:55.540
- So if we...

35:58.770 --> 36:00.670
So if we stay off the field,
will we get better?

36:00.680 --> 36:03.440
- I hope so.

36:05.410 --> 36:07.410
Just one thing at a time.

36:09.550 --> 36:11.720
- Mom'll be happy.
She can blame it on me.

36:11.790 --> 36:15.020
- She's not gonna blame you.
- She hates sports.

36:15.020 --> 36:17.660
- You need to ease up on her.

36:19.490 --> 36:22.030
Yeah, your mom hates sports,
but she's come to every one

36:22.100 --> 36:24.560
of your games.
She's learned all the rules.

36:24.570 --> 36:26.430
- She still doesn't
understand offsides.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.500
- Nobody understands offsides.

36:29.570 --> 36:32.240
Look, she did her best with you.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.370
And me.

36:36.910 --> 36:40.380
She has only ever
tried to protect you.

36:40.450 --> 36:42.250
- I'm supposed to graduate
this year.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.280
I have... plans.

36:44.350 --> 36:47.850
- You're still gonna
do those plans, you just...

36:47.920 --> 36:51.390
you might have
to adjust the timeline.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.390
(sighing)

36:59.670 --> 37:01.600
- Did you order?

37:03.670 --> 37:06.240
- No. I can't eat.

37:06.310 --> 37:08.410
- So your father, he was in his

37:08.410 --> 37:10.410
late 30s when he left Millwood?

37:10.410 --> 37:13.280
Yet...

37:13.280 --> 37:15.350
he still became
senior partner at CTS.

37:18.390 --> 37:20.220
How?

37:20.290 --> 37:23.090
- He always gets what he wants.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.630

37:31.030 --> 37:33.030
Hi.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.830

This isn't about property
values. It's about sick girls.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.650

for a couple of...

37:54.660 --> 37:56.690

It's enough. Now, come home.

wanted to come and see you.

I missed you.

40:34.350 --> 40:37.080
I was worried about you.
Is that OK?

have been worried

have a drive-thru dry cleaners.
