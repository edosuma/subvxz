<i>Good afternoon, miss.</i>

00:39.875 --> 00:42.750
First of all, you must know that
this interview will be recorded.

00:43.375 --> 00:44.875
Do you agree?

00:47.583 --> 00:49.458
My name is Jose Lopez CedeÃ±o.

00:49.667 --> 00:53.875
And I will be responsible for
the forensic psychiatric assessment.

00:54.958 --> 00:55.875
Let's begin...

00:56.667 --> 00:58.708
Miss Romina del Rio Pineda,

00:59.250 --> 01:00.833
is that your full name?

01:02.375 --> 01:03.792
Correct.

01:05.458 --> 01:06.833
OK, Miss Romina...

01:07.333 --> 01:11.625
The first thing I want to ask you
is if you are aware

01:12.333 --> 01:15.750
or if it is clear
why you are here today?

01:18.083 --> 01:20.208
OK, just to make sure

01:20.292 --> 01:23.875
that the information,
previously given is accurate

01:25.583 --> 01:28.583
and the reason why you're here

01:29.208 --> 01:31.208
is because the judge
who's working this case

01:31.458 --> 01:35.875
has asked for this assessment
by order of the prosecution.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.125
The results of this assessment
will be taken into consideration

01:39.250 --> 01:42.250
at the inquiry process
that is carried out during the case.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.208
Do you understand
what I just explained?

01:44.875 --> 01:49.583
OK, miss, so before we move on
to the succession of the events

01:49.667 --> 01:52.708
I need you to tell me if you were

01:52.792 --> 01:55.292
a participant, victim or a witness

01:55.375 --> 01:58.542
of the multiple homicides
that took place at Crystal Lake

01:58.667 --> 02:01.667
on June 27th, 2016.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.708
Understood.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.833
Were you familiar with the victims,

02:09.208 --> 02:11.625
Ximena Navarro, Celia Bogliano,

02:12.000 --> 02:13.125
Ramon Larrain,

02:13.542 --> 02:17.667
Arturo Guiza, Victor Ortega
and Diego Navas?

02:19.667 --> 02:23.208
Let's move on to the narration
of the events' succession

02:23.292 --> 02:25.125
that occurred on that occasion.

02:25.583 --> 02:27.375
It is very important
that you remain relaxed,

02:27.667 --> 02:29.250
I ask you, please,
to do it with full calmness.

02:29.375 --> 02:34.250
Try to narrate the sequence of
the events as descriptive as possible,

02:34.458 --> 02:36.167
trying not to leave any detail behind

02:36.375 --> 02:38.833
no matter how insignificant it may seem.

02:39.958 --> 02:41.792
You can proceed with your statement.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.667
It's always the same, it turns out
the man is the problem, as if...

07:00.750 --> 07:03.708
-Of course! If not, who? Women?
-Obviously, Celia!

07:03.792 --> 07:06.208
Give me a clever argument
and I'll accept it.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.375
There's nothing clever to say.

07:08.458 --> 07:11.125
It's just that you dress so sexy,
it's a clear invitation to be raped.

07:11.208 --> 07:15.083
Fuck off! You are an asshole!
Ramon, say something to him!

07:15.167 --> 07:17.417
No, dear, what can I say?
He's speaking the truth.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.208
-That's right, man!
-No, you're both pigs!

07:20.292 --> 07:22.458
-But you still love me, right?
-I'm starting to doubt it...

07:22.542 --> 07:27.250
-What do you think, Diego?
-What? I wasn't paying attention.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.875
-Pay attention, dude!
-No, don't worry.

07:29.958 --> 07:32.417
I wouldn't pay attention
either with that bombshell.

07:32.792 --> 07:35.042
Too bad, dumbass!
Suck on that! Maybe next time.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.875
-But, thanks for the compliment.
-Oh, yeah! We're all so cute!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.708
-Group hug!
-Yeah!

07:40.792 --> 07:42.708
-Weren't you asleep, dude?
-No, I'm awake now.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.458
No shit!

07:45.542 --> 07:48.750
-Can we pull over somewhere?
-Yes, please!

07:48.833 --> 07:50.375
-I want to smoke!
-Me too...

07:50.458 --> 07:52.167
No, hang in there!
We're almost there.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.625
-I need to piss, dickhead!
-That's your problem, dude.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.458
-Who are you calling?
-Romina, but she's not picking up.

07:57.542 --> 07:59.708
-You've got to be kidding!
-That "Romina" shit again.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.125
-What did you expect? It's Diego.
-You had to mess this up.

08:02.208 --> 08:04.792
Xime, if I were you I would
send him to hell with Romina.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.708
There are some things that
go beyond your understanding.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.625
Asshole, she's my best friend and
I have two missed calls from her.

08:08.708 --> 08:10.667
-I just want to know if she's fine.
-Shame on you!

08:10.750 --> 08:12.583
I don't understand why someone like
Romina can be your best friend.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.375
-That's right, man!
-Look, Xime.

08:14.458 --> 08:17.375
I'm just saying don't be surprised
if he dumps you for that freak of nature.

08:17.458 --> 08:18.667
Stop it, man!

08:18.750 --> 08:21.250
I don't like you offending
others in front of me!

08:21.333 --> 08:23.917
-The queen has spoken!
-No, it's not like that.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.042
It's just that you don't know how
your words can hurt people.

08:26.125 --> 08:28.333
She's right,
you hurt me with your words.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.500
-Damn, you're full of shit, man!
-You're overreacting.

08:30.583 --> 08:31.958
-Yes, you're full of shit, dumbass.
-Exactly!

08:32.042 --> 08:34.207
Suck it! Besides, what about you?
You stupid Muppet!

08:34.292 --> 08:38.000
-What the fuck? Why a "Muppet"?
-You look like one, dude!

08:38.082 --> 08:42.750
Let's go buy some beer,
chips and marshmallows.

08:42.832 --> 08:44.125
Yes! I'm in!

08:44.207 --> 08:46.958
But don't give the marshmallows
to this guy or he will eat them all.

08:47.042 --> 08:50.292
-Yeah, that's right!
-Man, I really need to piss!

08:50.375 --> 08:52.458
-Enough! Hold it!
-Fine, I'm sorry!

08:52.542 --> 08:53.750
This is the fourth time
you've said that!

08:53.833 --> 08:55.792
Everybody just shut the fuck up!
Please!

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
-Dear, don't shout.
-They're stressing me out!

09:00.583 --> 09:04.875
No, love, you can't be shouting in here,
we all come with good vibes.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.167
That's right, friend! Relax!

09:06.250 --> 09:10.125
-Dude, there aren't any stores nearby.
-Every time you shout, a dwarf dies!

09:10.875 --> 09:14.375
Or a fairy, because
I do believe in fairies!

09:14.542 --> 09:17.458
You know what, I'm going to go
back if you keep that up, assholes!

09:17.542 --> 09:20.500
-Stop it, Scrooge McDuck!
-Stupid Scrooge McDuck has spoken!

09:22.417 --> 09:24.417
It's complicated. Nothing?

09:25.417 --> 09:28.042
No, it rings,
but she doesn't pick up.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.292
Maybe she just left her phone somewhere.

09:30.958 --> 09:34.792
Yeah, it's probably nothing.
I'm sure she'll call me back later.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.375
-Another one?
-No, I want to go to the restroom.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
-Sure?
-Yes.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.667
All right.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.375
This place is full of stones!

10:17.458 --> 10:18.542
-Are we there yet?
-Turn around here.

10:18.625 --> 10:19.667
You sure?

10:19.750 --> 10:22.333
Can't you see the damn sign
that says "camping zone at 2 km"?

10:22.417 --> 10:26.333
I just wanted to be sure.
Fuck off.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.792
-Don't ask stupid questions!
-Enough! Stop arguing for 5 minutes!

10:29.875 --> 10:32.292
We can't! That's the wonderful
foundation of our friendship.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.583
-Fuck yeah!
-Fuck yeah!

10:34.667 --> 10:38.000
-You should go out to meet new people!
-There's no way chicks get this shit.

10:38.083 --> 10:42.458
Just one thing, there's no way that you
understand friendship like we do.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.458
-How many female friends do you have?
-Exactly.

10:44.542 --> 10:47.000
-Well, I hate most girls.
-See? All girls say the same!

10:47.083 --> 10:48.542
-Stop it, sweetheart!
-It's the truth!

10:48.625 --> 10:50.417
You all hate other girls!

10:50.500 --> 10:53.667
You don't like other chicks,
but you have your groups of friends

10:53.750 --> 10:55.417
and your little cliques and stuff.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.375
But the truth is, friendship
among women is pure hypocrisy!

10:58.458 --> 11:01.542
Well, except with boys, in that case
it's always straightforward and honest.

11:01.625 --> 11:02.667
No freaking way!

11:02.750 --> 11:05.375
What? I'm serious! We just
want to fuck everyone, that's it.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.000
-You're disgusting!
-That's why we have girlfriends.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.083
-Disgusting?
-Well, not all of us, man.

11:09.167 --> 11:11.000
-You're right, I'm sorry, man.
-Your case is special.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.500
Exactly! Who would want to fuck
that ugly thing?

11:13.583 --> 11:14.667
You're right!

11:14.750 --> 11:15.875
-Gross!
-Stop it already!

11:16.042 --> 11:18.458
Alright dude, forgive me.
You can't take a joke!

11:18.583 --> 11:20.333
Hey, I'm the only funny guy in here!

11:20.417 --> 11:21.417
You?

11:21.500 --> 11:24.167
I would agree if anyone besides
yourself understood your jokes.

11:24.250 --> 11:29.042
You know what? Thing is my humor is way
too complicated for the simple-minded.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.542
-What?
-What a dick!

11:30.625 --> 11:34.417
-He's eating all the chips!
-No way! Those are mine!

11:34.500 --> 11:37.125
Why did you leave him with
all the food on the backseat?

11:37.208 --> 11:40.167
Look, Arturo, let me explain something,
we're going to a place to camp

11:40.250 --> 11:42.083
where there are no stores,
no civilization

11:42.167 --> 11:44.458
and you're eating
the only food we bought!

11:44.542 --> 11:47.208
-What can I say? I'm a growing child.
-But to the sides, dear!

11:47.292 --> 11:50.250
-Unbelievable!
-Why would you leave him with the food?

11:50.333 --> 11:52.833
-Obviously he'll eat it!
-Where do we put it then? On the roof?

11:52.917 --> 11:56.958
-Dude, stop eating. Or give me one!
-Diego, which way now?

11:57.042 --> 11:59.417
-Are we there yet? I'm starving!
-Where? To the left?

11:59.500 --> 12:02.292
-To the left and then to the right.
-Do you think there will be a buffet?

12:02.375 --> 12:04.708
Yeah, sure, you can have
your eggs any style.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.833
Yeah! And two midgets
in tuxes to serve them, Celia!

12:07.917 --> 12:11.292
Excuse me, but every time
I go camping there's a buffet.

12:11.375 --> 12:12.458
I'm sorry!

12:12.542 --> 12:14.917
I always take her to cool places,
not to this kind of shit.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.750
There won't be a buffet, Celia,
get used to the idea

12:16.833 --> 12:19.125
-that you'll have to fish for your meal!
-Gross! Never.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.417
Whenever I went camping
with my dad we had to hunt.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.333
Nobody cares, Ximena!

12:23.417 --> 12:25.000
Take it easy, girls!

12:25.708 --> 12:28.917
-They're going to bite each other.
-Don't you ever do that again!

12:29.000 --> 12:30.792
-Look, there's the checkpoint!
-Yeah, I see it.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.083
-There's the security guard.
-I'm dying of heat!

12:33.167 --> 12:34.667
-No kidding, dude!
-I'm suffocating.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.542
-Good morning, sunshine!
-Shut up, this guy will lynch us.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.333
-Dude, how does he say it?
-Shut the hell up!

12:39.417 --> 12:42.375
-Do it.
-Want some wood?

12:42.708 --> 12:44.583
Want some wood?

12:44.667 --> 12:46.833
Good afternoon, how are you?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.458
-Are you here for camping?
-No, we just came to say hello!

12:50.542 --> 12:54.417
I'm sorry, it's just the dog.
You know how dogs are. Which way?

12:55.750 --> 12:58.792
Drive straight ahead and where you
see a free spot, park in there.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.792
OK, and where is the coolest place?

13:00.875 --> 13:03.292
I can tell you! I know a pretty
cool spot, I've already come here.

13:03.375 --> 13:04.375
-Sure?
-Yes!

13:04.458 --> 13:05.458
Alright, thanks.

13:05.542 --> 13:08.083
-Right, I remember you.
-Lady-killer!

13:08.167 --> 13:10.375
-He can tell you where to go.
-Fine!

13:10.917 --> 13:13.292
Are there other people camping?

13:13.375 --> 13:15.708
There's someone else,
but that person is by the lake.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.333
You'll have everything free
for yourselves.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.125
-Nice.
-Hell, yeah! I hate people!

13:19.208 --> 13:21.792
-Hey, is it a chick or a guy?
-Enough with that!

13:21.875 --> 13:24.917
-What? Maybe she's a hottie!
-Gross. Enough! You're so horny!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.917
-Enough.
-Let him!

13:27.000 --> 13:29.625
-Honey, he's staring at me.
-Do you have cigarettes?

13:29.708 --> 13:32.292
-Celia, he can listen to you.
-No, sorry, we didn't buy any.

13:32.375 --> 13:35.583
-OK, it will be 300 per night.
-Fine, what then?

13:35.750 --> 13:38.792
-150 bucks per head?
-No, dude!

13:39.250 --> 13:40.208
Just 100, man!

13:40.292 --> 13:42.167
No, I never pay!

13:42.333 --> 13:44.833
-What?
-You're always so stingy!

13:44.917 --> 13:48.917
Fuck off! Arturo and I
didn't bring any chicks, dude.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.375
You and Diego should pay 200, assholes.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.750
-You're so tight!
-Yeah, fucking miser!

13:53.833 --> 13:56.250
What, man? Are we going
to share the girls too?

13:56.333 --> 13:58.167
Fuck off!
Stop talking shit!

13:58.250 --> 13:59.250
I can pay your share.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.667
I'll pay for the whole
trip in that case!

14:00.750 --> 14:03.208
-Not even in your dreams.
-Hey, we're still missing money!

14:03.292 --> 14:05.042
Take this, dude.

14:05.917 --> 14:08.250
-Honey...
-I'm sorry, sir.

14:08.417 --> 14:11.167
-Shut up.
-But he's staring at me!

14:11.250 --> 14:13.417
Let's go already!
I want to get there!

14:13.792 --> 14:15.875
Just count it.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.208
-Thank you.
-That's all? Thanks, sir.

14:21.292 --> 14:23.667
-He thought you were rich.
-Come on! Let's go!

14:23.750 --> 14:25.958
He thought you were Scrooge McDuck!

14:26.375 --> 14:29.500
Man, I'm traumatized!
Did you see his mouth?

14:29.583 --> 14:32.250
-It's disgusting.
-You can't find toothpaste out here!

14:32.875 --> 14:36.250
If you keep insulting the pedestrians
I won't rate you five stars.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.500
-So what?
-Oh, love, you have my five stars!

14:43.083 --> 14:45.208
-This place is pretty cool!
-I told you it was cool.

14:45.292 --> 14:47.250
But we're heading way over there.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.917
Did she answer?
No, but I can't call her here.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.792
-There's no way I'll get a signal.
-It's just for two days,

14:51.875 --> 14:53.208
-and she knew you were coming.
-Right.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.500
Besides, you're with me now!

14:55.958 --> 14:58.917
-You're right.
-Pay attention, kid.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.208
-Sorry.
-Diego, come here!

15:01.417 --> 15:03.792
It's going to rain, hurry up!

15:04.375 --> 15:05.958
Hey!!

15:06.042 --> 15:07.917
Open the door!

15:10.542 --> 15:12.875
I knew I could count on you, my friend.

15:13.375 --> 15:16.292
Hey! Aren't you going to help
with the bags?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.583
-Later!
-It's raining!

15:25.708 --> 15:28.083
-Do you need help?
-Yes.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.417
You wanted to bring
your own tent.

15:31.917 --> 15:34.792
-Now you're screwed.
-Don't be such a jerk.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.250
Fine, but it would be easier
if you planned from the start

15:38.375 --> 15:41.417
-to sleep with me.
-If you can't perform, why risk it?

15:41.750 --> 15:44.000
-Give me that.
-Come over here.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.833
What did you just call me?

15:46.917 --> 15:48.750
Don't you ever call me fat again, Ramon!

15:48.833 --> 15:50.250
Stop showing off.

15:50.458 --> 15:53.208
-Don't you ever call me fat again!
-Fine, take it easy, skinny.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.333
Excuse me?
I want to sit down.

15:55.458 --> 15:58.583
-Then help me out.
-No way. Set my chair down, please.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.417
-Do I have to do it all?
-Yes, of course.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.708
How freaking convenient.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.833
Help me out, it's from your dad,
I don't know how to put it together.

16:05.917 --> 16:07.667
No, honey, investigate it.

16:09.042 --> 16:10.500
What a work of art.

16:10.583 --> 16:12.750
-Do you know how to use this?
-No.

16:13.917 --> 16:15.792
What's up, dude?
That's enough, isn't it?

16:15.875 --> 16:17.333
No fucking way!

16:17.458 --> 16:19.583
Come on! Three more trips,
don't be a lazy-ass!

16:19.708 --> 16:21.792
No, man! I want a fucking beer.

16:21.875 --> 16:24.417
Oh shit! Be careful or you'll get
marks on your ass.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.375
Excuse me!
Say something to him, Ramon!

16:26.458 --> 16:28.500
Don't be an ass!
I'll buy you five more if you'd like.

16:28.583 --> 16:32.042
Come on, dude! Let's get more firewood
and we can drink some beers afterwards!

16:32.167 --> 16:35.417
Besides, why do you workout daily?
To bring three little twigs?

16:35.667 --> 16:38.833
-But the Pilates seem to be working!
-Right? Hell, yeah!

16:38.917 --> 16:41.417
-You're so pathetic, poor things!
-Look, you can even sit right here!

16:41.500 --> 16:43.375
Hey, dude. She can sit here, too!

16:43.458 --> 16:46.000
-Boom, bitch!
-Boom!

16:46.708 --> 16:48.708
You'll starve to death,
fucking punk!

16:48.792 --> 16:51.625
Yeah right! Meow.
Go get more firewood, dude.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.542
Bunch of assholes!
Why do I always have to go?

16:53.625 --> 16:54.833
Because you're the strongest.

16:55.125 --> 16:58.042
This could be a villa, definitely.

16:58.333 --> 16:59.958
We should sell your tent
and stay in mine.

17:00.042 --> 17:02.208
Yeah, right!

18:58.667 --> 19:01.208
The mosquitoes are biting me.
Can you pass me the...

19:01.333 --> 19:03.167
-Celia!
-Here's yours.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.042
-Thanks.
-Hey, I want one too.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.333
They're in the cooler.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.875
Can you get me one, please?

19:10.667 --> 19:13.708
-Celia, can you pass the repellent?
-Hey, where's Eze?

19:14.958 --> 19:16.542
What about Eze?

19:16.625 --> 19:18.625
He went for more firewood,
but he's been gone for a while.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.625
But he can get lost.

19:20.708 --> 19:23.292
Ramon, what does it matter if Ezequiel
gets lost? You're here with me!

19:23.375 --> 19:25.708
It matters!
Will someone come with me?

19:25.958 --> 19:28.417
-Are you seriously going to look for him?
-Yes.

19:28.708 --> 19:30.292
Fuck you, Ramon.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.208
-You too, bye!
-See you!

19:35.167 --> 19:37.417
Hey, can you get me one?

19:37.500 --> 19:40.667
Celia, they're next to you, literally!

19:40.750 --> 19:43.167
-Like, right there.
-I love you, fatty!

20:11.417 --> 20:12.875
Eze!

20:17.833 --> 20:20.292
What happened with the firewood?

20:41.000 --> 20:45.208
-She's fucking hot, dude!
-Go get her, tiger, I brought a date.

20:47.042 --> 20:48.958
Sure, dude! Why not?

20:49.042 --> 20:51.250
Hell yeah, but come with me.
Don't be a faggot.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.000
-What for, dude?
-Come on, man!

20:54.083 --> 20:56.250
Fine, but let's go from the other side.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.958
Fuck it. Let's go.

21:04.958 --> 21:06.875
She's sexy as fuck!

21:07.750 --> 21:09.125
Shit, dude!

21:09.208 --> 21:12.167
-It's Romina.
-I know, man, look at her.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.458
-What's she doing here?
-I don't know. It's great that she came.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.292
-She's freaking hot, dude.
-Why the hell is she swimming naked?

21:18.375 --> 21:20.583
Let her! Can't you see?

21:21.083 --> 21:22.375
Very nice.

21:22.458 --> 21:25.833
Hey, don't tell fucking Diego we saw her.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.208
No way! What for?
Let's enjoy it!

21:28.292 --> 21:30.375
Yeah, man.
That faggot can go fuck himself!

21:31.792 --> 21:35.333
-She's not as boring as they say.
-Right? Look at her huge tits!

21:35.625 --> 21:37.500
Don't be so stupid, dude.

21:38.708 --> 21:41.000
-Let's get closer, man!
-Let's go.

21:42.292 --> 21:45.208
Wait, asshole!

21:45.417 --> 21:48.125
-Dickhead, she saw me... Let's go!
-No, she didn't see you!

21:48.208 --> 21:50.708
-Fuck this.
-Wait, fucker!

21:50.875 --> 21:53.292
-Where are you going?
-Celia will cut my balls off, idiot!

21:53.375 --> 21:57.083
We'll come back, right?
Motherfucker!

22:22.000 --> 22:23.667
Where were you?

22:24.833 --> 22:27.500
-Where's the firewood, asshole?
-I'm sorry, dude, I forgot it.

22:27.667 --> 22:30.042
-Sorry.
-And here I am waiting like an idiot.

22:30.125 --> 22:31.917
Honey, come with me to the store.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.500
-Bring more beer.
-To the tent, idiot!

22:36.708 --> 22:38.500
Just let me drink a beer.

22:40.375 --> 22:43.042
Shit, you took too long!
It started raining.

22:43.125 --> 22:46.375
-Yeah, I know.
-Sorry, man. Let me drink my beer.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.875
Why don't we go to the lake?

22:51.250 --> 22:52.875
And bring firewood on the way back?

22:52.958 --> 22:55.958
No, Diego, don't worry,
I'll go for the firewood later.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.542
-Besides, it's already raining.
-Yeah, light the fire right here

22:59.625 --> 23:01.667
-while we drink some beer.
-Ramon, you're talking with me!

23:01.750 --> 23:03.958
Yeah, right! "Light the fire",
It's raining!

23:04.042 --> 23:07.875
The problem with the bonfire
is that there's no firewood!

23:08.042 --> 23:11.542
Why just you? Why can't you
apologize and let me go with you?

23:11.625 --> 23:15.417
-"Why do you go with Ezequiel?"
-"Honey, he's my best friend."

23:15.500 --> 23:17.083
Let's have a beer.

23:17.917 --> 23:19.500
Fine.

23:19.583 --> 23:20.833
They made up.

23:20.917 --> 23:22.750
They're acting funny.

23:22.833 --> 23:24.292
What are you laughing about, assholes?

23:24.375 --> 23:26.833
-Nothing, at my friend here...
-He's really funny.

23:26.917 --> 23:28.875
Enough... enough!
Cheers!

23:28.958 --> 23:30.042
Cheers!

23:30.125 --> 23:31.583
I don't have a beer,
can you get me one?

23:33.458 --> 23:36.667
-Cheers to this sunny weather!
-Dude, you gave me an empty one.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.083
Hey! My hair!

23:40.167 --> 23:42.083
Cheers before it starts raining!

23:42.167 --> 23:43.458
Before it rains even more?

23:59.375 --> 24:01.667
Hey, you even suck
at roasting marshmallows.

24:01.750 --> 24:04.125
-What do you think, Eze?
-I like them burnt!

24:04.250 --> 24:06.458
Now can you see what
I needed the firewood for?

24:06.542 --> 24:08.833
-Yeah, man! It's a great bonfire!
-You nailed it!

24:08.917 --> 24:11.250
-We even got dry wood.
-It's excellent!

24:11.333 --> 24:12.833
Yeah, you nailed it!

24:14.542 --> 24:17.083
Good for me! Hey!
It's not the first time.

24:17.167 --> 24:19.208
Remember when we went to summer camp?

24:19.292 --> 24:21.625
-You're right!
-Yeah, I remember!

24:21.708 --> 24:23.958
At the camp where
"I fell from the bus"

24:24.042 --> 24:26.083
and I "was drunk"
according to the teachers!

24:26.167 --> 24:27.167
No way!

24:27.250 --> 24:28.583
And I was wearing a skirt
so my ass was showing.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.917
But she didn't fall!

24:30.000 --> 24:32.750
I know for certain she threw herself
so that Ramon would see her ass!

24:32.833 --> 24:36.667
Exactly! You did it so that Ramon
could see your ass.

24:36.750 --> 24:40.625
-Maybe I did!
-Truth is, that's how I fell in love.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.208
Like when this dude fell in love
with the guy with long hair.

24:46.292 --> 24:49.125
-What was his name?
-Ramses! His name was Ramses!

24:49.208 --> 24:51.125
-Ramses!
-No freaking way! What a shame!

24:51.208 --> 24:53.458
Dude, his back was turned to me

24:53.542 --> 24:57.000
-and he had a great ass!
-Yeah! But it was a guy!

24:57.083 --> 25:00.167
-He was a dude!
-Anyone can get confused!

25:00.292 --> 25:03.875
And you were so drunk
you peed your pants, dude!

25:03.958 --> 25:05.292
Speaking of piss...

25:05.375 --> 25:07.250
You pissed on yourself at my house
when we were 12.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.458
-No way!
-Yeah, it was disgusting!

25:09.542 --> 25:14.250
You shouldn't say that after all these
years. Take it easy, man!

25:14.333 --> 25:15.417
At what age did you stop pissing yourself?

25:15.500 --> 25:16.750
She's defending him.

25:16.833 --> 25:20.125
-Don't be such a pig!
-What do you mean you can't say it?

25:20.208 --> 25:22.125
By the way, at what age did you
stop peeing on yourself?

25:22.208 --> 25:25.667
-We're just talking about his pee.
-Did you hear that?

25:26.042 --> 25:30.833
Listen to me, I'm serious,
there's something over there.

25:30.958 --> 25:33.000
-Where?
-Listen!

25:33.083 --> 25:34.583
Let's check it out.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.458
There.
Look, right there!

25:36.542 --> 25:39.000
-It's just Ximena.
-No dear, I'm serious.

25:39.167 --> 25:41.250
It's probably just a fucking squirrel.
Calm down.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.333
No, let's go and see.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.458
It's a squirrel alright,
a bear-sized squirrel!

25:45.542 --> 25:47.792
-Where, asshole?
-Right there, dude!

25:47.875 --> 25:50.792
-Please, I'm freaking out. Let's go!
-Grab your flashlights!

25:50.875 --> 25:53.083
-Are you sure, dear?
-Look!

25:55.750 --> 25:57.458
You're fucking kidding!

26:10.167 --> 26:12.333
-Be careful, it's slippery.
-Yeah.

26:14.417 --> 26:18.417
-I'm really scared!
-I know, we had all night.

26:18.792 --> 26:21.500
-Careful where you step!
-I'm sure I heard something.

26:21.750 --> 26:24.500
-I'm really scared!
-Careful where you step!

26:26.792 --> 26:29.792
-Shine the light to the left.
-Why don't we go back?

26:29.875 --> 26:32.125
-No, let's check this out.
-Are you sure?

26:37.375 --> 26:38.958
Shine the light to the left.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.042
Hey!

26:46.125 --> 26:48.167
I'll wait right here.
This is fucking absurd!

26:48.250 --> 26:51.417
-Don't eat all the marshmallows.
-Holly shit! Did you see that?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.167
-What?
-It went over there!

26:53.250 --> 26:54.500
-She's right! To the left!
-No, to the right.

26:54.583 --> 26:55.625
I saw it.

26:55.708 --> 26:57.667
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, trust me.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.083
-Fine, we'll follow you!
-I can't see anything.

27:00.208 --> 27:02.708
-I told you, it went to the right!
-I think I heard something.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.208
Be careful.

27:42.542 --> 27:44.083
Careful where you step!

27:44.167 --> 27:46.542
-Sure?
-Careful with the spiders.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.042
Enough!

27:48.125 --> 27:49.208
Are you alright, Ximena?

27:49.292 --> 27:52.042
Yeah, I just have something in my shoe.

27:52.708 --> 27:55.083
Seriously, be careful with the animals.

27:55.167 --> 27:56.250
-Shut up.
-I'm just saying.

27:56.333 --> 27:57.583
Stop it, don't say that.

27:57.667 --> 27:59.250
But there are. So be careful.

27:59.333 --> 28:02.333
-Arturo, stop touching my leg.
-I hate the woods, I hate nature!

28:02.417 --> 28:05.333
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

28:08.708 --> 28:10.667
-This sucks.
-How can you see?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.542
-Now what?
-I don't know, I've got no clue.

28:13.792 --> 28:15.833
Let's go back.
This is boring!

28:15.917 --> 28:18.708
Aren't you worried about
who was spying on us?

28:18.792 --> 28:21.000
Probably it was just an animal
or the ranger.

28:21.083 --> 28:22.583
Yeah, or the other camper.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.500
I want to keep looking. This is fun.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.917
-Yeah, come on, honey.
-No, I'll wait for you back at the camp.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.083
Come on, man!
Don't be such a party-pooper!

28:29.167 --> 28:30.750
Are you worried about your
little friend being alone?

28:30.833 --> 28:33.833
-It's not like a bear will rape him.
-He would probably enjoy it.

28:34.042 --> 28:35.792
All of this is stupid!

28:35.917 --> 28:38.583
"All of this is stupid"?
So I'm stupid?

28:38.708 --> 28:40.250
Come on, honey,
I didn't say that.

28:40.333 --> 28:43.125
Then what is this all about, Ramon?
You have to do what I say.

28:43.208 --> 28:45.708
OK? I don't give a shit
if you think it's stupid!

28:45.792 --> 28:48.792
So we're going to look for the ranger
because I'm not going to stay here

28:48.875 --> 28:51.292
without finding who the fuck
was spying on us!

28:51.375 --> 28:52.542
Fine, let's go.

28:52.625 --> 28:54.292
-Should we keep looking?
-Yeah.

28:54.375 --> 28:57.125
-Me too!
-Stop yelling at me, OK?

28:57.542 --> 29:00.125
-Oh, sorry, was I not invited?
-No, you are invited!

29:00.292 --> 29:02.125
Sure, why not.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.250
-If you don't want me to go, it's OK.
-Let's go!

29:06.917 --> 29:08.917
Oh, God. Oh, God.

30:58.167 --> 30:59.875
Be careful, it's muddy.

31:08.042 --> 31:09.250
Careful.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.667
-I don't think anyone's in there.
-Shut up!

31:15.125 --> 31:17.125
-I'll go and see.
-Wait!

31:30.167 --> 31:31.750
There's no one in here!

31:38.875 --> 31:40.167
It belongs to a girl.

31:40.250 --> 31:42.250
No shit, Sherlock!

31:42.625 --> 31:44.417
Or a feminine guy.

31:44.500 --> 31:48.333
Well, at least now we know that
there's nothing to worry about, right?

31:57.625 --> 31:59.250
Definitely this dude didn't do it.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.542
-Then who?
-How do I know, but...

32:01.708 --> 32:03.375
but he's asleep.

32:03.500 --> 32:06.125
-Coming.
-Of course he didn't do it.

32:09.958 --> 32:14.333
-Hello, sorry to bother you.
-Someone was spying on us.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.875
-Really?
-Yeah, we were at the bonfire,

32:16.958 --> 32:18.708
and someone was spying
on us from the woods.

32:18.792 --> 32:20.250
Did you do it?

32:20.333 --> 32:23.167
No, of course not, miss,
I was already asleep.

32:23.292 --> 32:25.333
But don't worry,
this place is safe.

32:25.458 --> 32:28.167
You see? It was probably just
an animal or something like that.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.333
And the other camper?

32:30.792 --> 32:33.000
She's a lady.

32:33.833 --> 32:35.833
Just like you.

32:35.917 --> 32:37.875
See? It's nothing, right?

32:37.958 --> 32:40.042
Thanks, sir, and sorry.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.083
-Are you OK?
-No.

32:43.833 --> 32:46.167
I want to know what is out there.

32:49.333 --> 32:52.667
-What could it have been?
-A deer, or a wolf, who knows.

32:52.750 --> 32:55.292
Damn it. Who knows.

32:59.625 --> 33:01.625
I want a beer!

33:02.000 --> 33:03.500
Yeah, me too.

33:04.458 --> 33:06.125
Beer, beer, beer!

33:06.792 --> 33:10.500
-No! My bonfire!
-Light it up, I'm cold.

33:15.583 --> 33:18.750
Seriously, shorts in the woods.
Worst decision of my life.

33:20.458 --> 33:21.917
Hey, and me?

33:23.375 --> 33:26.458
-Hey!
-I'm still here.

33:31.833 --> 33:32.833
Hey.

33:32.917 --> 33:34.417
How'd it go with the ranger?
Everything OK?

33:34.500 --> 33:37.125
-No, he didn't say anything.
-He was asleep.

33:37.208 --> 33:38.875
We found the other camper's
tent by the lake.

33:38.958 --> 33:42.458
Yeah, but we think it belongs to a girl
so there's nothing to worry about.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.708
-Is she hot or what?
-Wasn't Ezequiel the horny one?

33:46.958 --> 33:49.167
I'm just kidding.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.542
-And where's Ezequiel?
-Fucking Ezequiel.

33:52.625 --> 33:55.958
How boring!
I'm going to sit over here.

33:56.542 --> 33:57.583
Excuse me.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.542
-Let's get in our places!
-Be careful, Celia.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.250
Let's get comfortable!

34:02.333 --> 34:03.458
-Yeah.
-Cheers!

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
What's wrong with you?
Don't you care about Ezequiel?

34:06.083 --> 34:07.625
-No!
-No!

34:08.167 --> 34:10.292
Cool! I'll look for him.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.042
Good luck, man!

34:22.292 --> 34:23.917
Can't you hurry up?
I'm cold!

34:24.000 --> 34:26.667
Celia, a work of art takes time.

34:27.667 --> 34:30.167
Guys, don't you love the little smoke that
comes out of your mouth when you're cold?

34:30.250 --> 34:31.542
-No.
-No.

34:43.625 --> 34:45.042
Ezequiel!

34:53.917 --> 34:54.917
Ezequiel!

35:18.917 --> 35:20.083
Come here, dude.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.000
Come over here.

35:22.708 --> 35:24.458
-What, man?
-Look, look.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.417
She's inside, dude.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.708
She's going to sleep.

35:33.792 --> 35:36.250
No way, she just got inside.

35:36.625 --> 35:39.750
-She's smoking hot, dude!
-Fuck, she saw us.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.833
No, she didn't.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.292
Look, look.
She's coming out.

35:46.542 --> 35:48.375
Dude, look at that.

35:48.792 --> 35:51.750
Look, look, look.

35:52.208 --> 35:54.833
-Move over, dude.
-Look.

35:57.375 --> 35:59.542
Look at that, man.

36:00.208 --> 36:03.125
What an ass she has on her.

36:06.167 --> 36:09.458
Look, look. Damn.

36:11.250 --> 36:13.417
-Come on, let's go!
-No, wait.

36:15.083 --> 36:17.458
That's why we're here!
Come on!

36:47.208 --> 36:49.417
Shut up!

37:23.583 --> 37:27.167
-I always...
-Relax, dude.

37:27.250 --> 37:29.750
Besides, it was great.

37:29.833 --> 37:33.458
-You don't think it's a big deal.
-Nobody will find out.

37:33.542 --> 37:36.125
Relax, man.

37:36.208 --> 37:37.375
Don't push me.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.042
You think everything's a joke, man.

37:39.125 --> 37:41.708
Relax dude.

37:41.875 --> 37:45.875
-Tomorrow we're getting out of here.
-Yeah dude, we'll leave tomorrow.

37:46.417 --> 37:48.833
What a mess.

37:49.417 --> 37:52.625
I don't give a shit.
I don't care.

37:55.125 --> 37:57.292
Look, everyone is asleep.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.958
What do I do about her?

37:59.042 --> 38:01.375
What are we going
to do when we return?

38:05.583 --> 38:08.208
Enough. Go be with your girl, man.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.958
See you tomorrow.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.167
That's fucking disgusting!

41:44.708 --> 41:46.125
Has anyone seen Diego?

41:52.917 --> 41:55.333
What time did you get back?
I didn't even notice.

41:55.542 --> 41:57.792
No clue. I didn't see Diego either,
Ximena.

41:57.875 --> 41:59.667
You were all wasted
when we returned.

41:59.958 --> 42:01.750
And what did you do
all that time?

42:02.083 --> 42:04.958
Well, it took me a while
to find him

42:05.042 --> 42:07.333
-and we chatted for a while.
-Yeah.

42:09.417 --> 42:10.917
I'm going to look for him.

42:15.042 --> 42:16.542
Something bad happened.

42:18.875 --> 42:21.417
Now can we begin to worry?

42:21.500 --> 42:23.667
We're screwed!
This is fucked up!

42:23.833 --> 42:26.042
There must be a logical
explanation for all of this.

42:26.125 --> 42:27.708
Can't you see, asshole?

42:27.792 --> 42:30.292
Yeah, but who would want to hurt us?
Let's think things over!

42:30.375 --> 42:33.750
Because the world is full
of crazy psychos! That's why!

42:34.125 --> 42:37.042
Let's go back to the camp,
grab our stuff and leave.

42:37.125 --> 42:39.583
-I agree.
-Yes, please let's go!

42:39.667 --> 42:41.167
I'm not going to stay here

42:41.250 --> 42:43.208
and wait for some crazy fucker
to come and kill us all! Are you?

42:43.292 --> 42:45.417
I agree, Didn't you watch
<i>Friday the 13th or <i> Evil Dead?</i></i>

42:45.500 --> 42:47.542
Or <i> The Blair Witch Project?
Where are you going?</i>

42:47.625 --> 42:50.417
To the guard's cabin to ask for help.
Anywhere!

44:11.000 --> 44:12.125
Now what?

44:12.667 --> 44:15.875
Well, let's get our stuff and
catch up to Ramon and Celia.

44:15.958 --> 44:17.583
Let's warn the other girl.

44:18.500 --> 44:21.500
OK, then you go to the camp
and we'll go to the lake.

44:21.750 --> 44:23.167
Fine, but hurry up, man.

44:23.333 --> 44:25.917
This really scares me and I don't want
to stay alone for a long time.

44:26.042 --> 44:28.458
Ezequiel is right there.
Don't worry, bro.

44:28.542 --> 44:31.167
Fuck! Ezequiel doesn't
know anything yet.

44:34.250 --> 44:36.083
-What was that?
-I don't know.

44:36.167 --> 44:38.125
I'm not going back to check.

44:38.208 --> 44:39.958
Let's go to call somebody.

45:24.083 --> 45:25.125
Dude.

45:29.250 --> 45:30.417
Ezequiel!

45:31.875 --> 45:33.583
Son of a bitch!

46:14.917 --> 46:16.083
Hello?

46:21.458 --> 46:22.500
Hello?

46:24.583 --> 46:25.583
Anybody?

46:30.792 --> 46:32.625
What do we do now?

46:34.542 --> 46:36.917
You go back to the camp with Arturo,
and I'll look for her.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.417
No, let's go!
Let the ranger take care of it!

46:39.625 --> 46:41.417
Trust me on this one.

46:42.042 --> 46:43.833
I'll look for you.

46:44.292 --> 46:46.083
Are we going to be alright?

46:53.083 --> 46:55.042
-Be very careful.
-You too.

47:05.458 --> 47:06.458
Hey!

47:07.833 --> 47:09.333
Hey! Sir!

47:10.500 --> 47:12.542
What the fuck, man!
You said there was nobody here!

47:12.625 --> 47:14.417
They fucked up my van, dude!

47:14.500 --> 47:16.625
-There's no way.
-Yes there is! It's a fucking mess!

47:16.708 --> 47:18.083
Do you want to go look
at it yourself?

47:18.167 --> 47:21.083
-It wasn't one of your friends?
-Why would they, asshole?

47:21.167 --> 47:22.958
Are you stupid or what?

47:23.500 --> 47:25.333
Who is going to take
responsibility for this? You?

47:25.417 --> 47:27.208
-Calm down.
-Yeah, right! "Calm down"!

47:27.292 --> 47:29.042
Are you going to go
and check it out?

47:29.417 --> 47:30.917
We can call a tow truck if you want.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.833
A tow truck, the fucking police.
There's a fucking psycho out there!

47:37.000 --> 47:39.583
-What are we going to do, Ramon?
-Shut the hell up.

47:43.250 --> 47:44.083
What now?

47:44.750 --> 47:47.125
-There's no dial tone.
-No fucking way.

47:50.792 --> 47:52.083
Do you have a cigarette?

47:52.250 --> 47:54.708
-Fuck off.
-Shit! Stop messing with us, asshole!

47:55.583 --> 47:57.792
Why don't you go out and see
who's out there, shithead!

47:58.750 --> 48:00.417
You're not going to get any signal.

48:00.583 --> 48:03.083
-Seriously?
-Not until you reach the highway.

48:03.667 --> 48:04.958
Is it far?

48:06.458 --> 48:08.708
Ramon, don't pull me
so hard, you idiot!

48:08.792 --> 48:11.958
What? Do you want to stay here
and get killed as well? Do you?

49:50.000 --> 49:51.375
Miss?

49:52.458 --> 49:53.583
Are you OK?

49:57.250 --> 49:58.250
Miss?

50:17.333 --> 50:19.542
Look for a signal over there.

50:26.625 --> 50:27.625
Hello?

50:27.708 --> 50:29.792
Hello? Miss, I have an emergency.

50:49.375 --> 50:51.292
Arturo. Arturo!

50:52.292 --> 50:53.667
Arturo!

51:29.167 --> 51:31.000
Ramon, what did she tell you?

51:31.125 --> 51:34.167
Do you think they're going to send
somebody, Celia?

51:36.708 --> 51:38.167
What are we going to do?

51:38.417 --> 51:40.542
Wait, obviously!
What do you want to do?

51:41.542 --> 51:43.208
Do you want to go running,
or what?

51:43.292 --> 51:45.583
I don't know.
I don't fucking know!

51:47.333 --> 51:49.958
-We should tell the others.
-No way! Fuck them!

51:50.042 --> 51:51.625
They wanted to stay, didn't they?

51:51.750 --> 51:54.917
Fuck you! Don't be such an ass!
They are your friends!

51:55.000 --> 51:56.500
No, they're not.

51:57.208 --> 51:59.000
Fuck you, dude!

52:00.042 --> 52:02.833
-Where are you going?
-To tell them! What else?

52:04.125 --> 52:06.167
Screw you.
Do what you want!

52:06.375 --> 52:08.625
And we're not together anymore, dick!

52:09.958 --> 52:11.500
Whatever you say!

52:17.292 --> 52:19.333
Go fuck yourself!

52:25.833 --> 52:31.042
CRYSTAL LAKE
CAMPSITE AREA

53:00.708 --> 53:03.125
Arturo. Arturo!
Arturo!

53:06.375 --> 53:07.917
Diego. Diego!

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Diego!

53:09.958 --> 53:11.042
Diego!

54:07.417 --> 54:08.750
Sir?

55:23.333 --> 55:24.958
Diego!

56:43.042 --> 56:45.167
No! No!
No!

56:45.542 --> 56:47.625
No!
No!

56:47.917 --> 56:49.375
Who are you?

56:59.333 --> 57:01.417
No! No!
No!

57:02.125 --> 57:03.333
No!

58:12.667 --> 58:14.833
What happened?
Calm down. Breathe!

58:14.917 --> 58:18.125
What happened?
Relax.

58:18.208 --> 58:20.083
Romina, she's...

58:20.250 --> 58:22.458
Calm down and take a breath.

58:23.583 --> 58:25.042
Easy. Breathe.

58:27.333 --> 58:28.333
Romina.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.625
Be quiet. We can't make any noise, OK?

59:29.250 --> 59:30.833
I'm here now, but you have
to remain calm.

59:30.917 --> 59:32.208
Yes.

59:43.042 --> 59:45.542
-Stay here.
-Diego, take me home.

59:45.625 --> 59:48.625
Yeah. But first we're going to hide
here for a while.

59:48.708 --> 59:51.167
Right here.
Let's hide.

59:51.917 --> 59:54.042
We must stay here
for a good while.

01:00:03.542 --> 01:00:05.333
You can't make any noise.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.500
Help!

01:00:16.125 --> 01:00:17.417
Hey!

01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:24.708
Sorry! No!
Forgive me!

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:41.125
She got ahead of us.

01:06:18.167 --> 01:06:19.375
Wait.

01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:34.500
Get down a bit.

01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:42.083
Close your eyes.

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:18.500
They all deserved it.

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:22.667
Yeah.

01:07:23.375 --> 01:07:25.500
Yes, Ximena deserved it as well.

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:41.792
Now what?

01:07:42.833 --> 01:07:44.167
I'll look for you.
