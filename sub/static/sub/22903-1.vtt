Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:54.077 --> 00:55.245
Keep moving.

01:02.119 --> 01:03.586
Please.

01:03.588 --> 01:06.021
Please. You don't
have to do this.

01:06.023 --> 01:07.225
My family is rich.

01:08.025 --> 01:09.991
I can get you anything you want.

01:09.993 --> 01:11.695
I don't want your money, Cuete.

01:14.898 --> 01:16.133
Whoever you are...

01:17.068 --> 01:18.766
you kill me...

01:18.768 --> 01:19.871
you're fucking dead!

01:21.573 --> 01:24.907
My uncle Ronaldo,
he's a captain in the cartel.

01:24.909 --> 01:27.575
Do you have any fucking idea
what he's gonna do to you

01:27.577 --> 01:31.078
and your whole fucking family
when he finds out about this?

01:38.588 --> 01:39.590
Angel?

01:51.669 --> 01:52.670
You know...

01:55.238 --> 01:57.475
I always imagined it would
end up like this.

02:01.312 --> 02:03.148
Even when I was locked up!

02:12.289 --> 02:13.989
Me too.

03:03.974 --> 03:04.942
Yo, Peaches.

03:18.956 --> 03:19.991
Hey, yo, bitch!

03:22.527 --> 03:24.529
Yo, bitch! I'm talkin' to you.

03:26.397 --> 03:30.399
Yeah, I know who you are,
Los Grajos bitch.

03:30.401 --> 03:35.069
Do you hear me, bitch? Because I say fuck
you to you and your whole broken-ass crew!

05:51.207 --> 05:53.945
In Spanish,
"Los Grajos" means "The Crows."

05:55.546 --> 05:57.748
And we used to be
a powerful street gang.

06:00.450 --> 06:01.984
Before the war with FSD,

06:01.986 --> 06:05.690
we used to run all the blocks
east of Euclid and below 94th.

06:06.957 --> 06:08.457
We were organized

06:08.459 --> 06:11.095
and our enemies didn't dare
push on our turf.

06:14.298 --> 06:15.963
But, of all the murders,
it only took one

06:15.965 --> 06:20.135
to set up the violence in which
many of my friends were killed

06:20.137 --> 06:22.039
and Los Grajos was left in ruin.

06:26.542 --> 06:28.811
The Native Americans believe

06:28.813 --> 06:32.483
the crow was once as beautiful
and as powerful as the eagle,

06:33.551 --> 06:36.120
with a captivating voice
and colorful feathers.

06:38.222 --> 06:39.955
The legend says

06:39.957 --> 06:43.224
his feathers got blackened
and his voice made hoarse

06:43.226 --> 06:46.998
because he danced too close
to the flames of a great fire.

06:48.099 --> 06:50.698
A fire that sent
all the dead souls on Earth

06:50.700 --> 06:53.037
into the sky to become stars.

06:54.371 --> 06:57.140
And the crow was their shepherd,

06:58.308 --> 07:00.211
drawing them closer
with his dance.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.115
That's how I know I'm a crow.

07:06.950 --> 07:09.219
I always dance too close
to the flames.

07:12.222 --> 07:15.792
The story Christian fed
the rest of the crew...

07:17.094 --> 07:20.531
was that some FSD homies
pulled up and blasted Manny.

07:22.265 --> 07:23.801
But I know that was a lie.

07:28.005 --> 07:29.841
He wouldn't tell me why.

07:32.142 --> 07:33.808
Now, everything is different.

07:35.178 --> 07:36.945
Without my crew,

07:36.947 --> 07:39.050
I'm forced to push
in the shadows...

07:39.916 --> 07:42.684
and live in hiding
from my enemies.

07:42.686 --> 07:44.856
Like that FSD puta from the bar.

07:47.123 --> 07:48.659
The only person I have left

07:49.460 --> 07:51.559
is my cousin Cammy.

07:51.561 --> 07:54.261
She's like a sister to me.

07:54.263 --> 07:57.701
Which is what makes everything that's
about to happen that much worse.

08:00.471 --> 08:03.371
They say revenge is a pendulum.

08:03.373 --> 08:05.775
Set in motion by those
who seek justice.

08:06.775 --> 08:09.277
Its weight measured in grief,

08:09.279 --> 08:11.282
and force determined by blood.

08:12.448 --> 08:13.917
It never stops,

08:14.784 --> 08:17.622
until one day it lands on you,

08:18.722 --> 08:20.056
or someone you love,

08:20.957 --> 08:23.527
and then, you have
to make a choice.

08:27.664 --> 08:29.397
What choice?

08:29.399 --> 08:31.433
Between weakness and strength.

08:33.803 --> 08:36.504
Maybe the real strength is
in the ability to walk away.

08:36.506 --> 08:40.075
Oh, come on, Tony. I'm talking
about life and death here.

08:40.077 --> 08:42.376
There's no walking away.

08:42.379 --> 08:44.479
Life and death.

08:44.481 --> 08:45.880
Is that what you told yourself?

08:45.882 --> 08:48.215
- After you bashed that girl's face in?
- Oh, come on.

08:48.217 --> 08:51.319
I walk out to have a smoke,
I come back in to a bloody mess.

08:51.321 --> 08:54.556
I told you already, she came
at me, I had no choice.

08:54.558 --> 08:59.061
- No choice.
- No. I was just sitting here minding my own business

08:59.063 --> 09:01.662
and that FSD bitch
starts banging on me

09:01.664 --> 09:04.431
and saying fuck me
and my whole crew.

09:04.433 --> 09:06.667
There were three of them.

09:06.669 --> 09:08.271
And she had a pool cue.

09:09.273 --> 09:12.673
All I had was a shot glass.

09:12.675 --> 09:15.008
- I had to improvise.
- Sheesh, you don't get it.

09:15.010 --> 09:18.412
- Don't get what?
- You're the problem.

09:18.414 --> 09:20.148
Trouble follows you.

09:20.150 --> 09:23.721
And if it happens again, I'm gonna
have to banish you from this bar.

09:26.890 --> 09:28.123
Banish me?

09:28.125 --> 09:29.757
Yes, banish you.

09:29.759 --> 09:31.560
It means you can't
come back here, ever.

09:31.562 --> 09:36.064
- You're gonna banish your most loyal customer?
- My most loyal customer.

09:36.066 --> 09:37.068
Damn right.

09:38.135 --> 09:42.537
Look, mija. I don't
wanna argue with you.

09:42.539 --> 09:44.940
But this bar has
a bad reputation

09:44.942 --> 09:47.778
because of customers like you
that don't know when to quit.

09:48.578 --> 09:49.746
I tell you what.

09:51.381 --> 09:52.616
For this shot...

09:53.917 --> 09:55.886
I'm gonna read your fortune.

10:10.567 --> 10:13.634
This card holds your future.

10:13.636 --> 10:14.904
I doubt that.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.313
Oh, this is bad.

10:23.313 --> 10:25.080
This is really bad.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.150
What's that mean?

10:27.650 --> 10:28.986
It's the Tower.

10:30.121 --> 10:32.186
It means conflict...

10:32.188 --> 10:33.390
Calamity, pain.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.758
But also growth.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.295
- Is that a fact?
- Tony, I'm serious.

10:41.231 --> 10:42.697
Look...

10:42.699 --> 10:44.767
I don't believe in this shit.

10:44.769 --> 10:48.836
And I really think this
is your future, not mine.

10:48.838 --> 10:51.538
If you keep bashing
people's faces in,

10:51.540 --> 10:53.209
this is gonna happen to you.

10:55.178 --> 10:57.280
No, no, it doesn't
work that way.

10:58.749 --> 11:01.919
Think about it.
My way sounds better.

11:04.722 --> 11:06.787
- Hey, where you goin'?
- I gotta go.

11:06.789 --> 11:09.159
Well, don't leave your
bruja shit here on the bar!

11:53.603 --> 11:54.804
Ah.

12:06.015 --> 12:07.548
Hey.

12:07.550 --> 12:08.883
I'm sorry. Yeah,
I know I'm late.

12:08.885 --> 12:11.521
I'll be there, like,
I'll be coming right now.

12:14.558 --> 12:15.525
What?

12:19.529 --> 12:20.798
Cammy...

12:22.866 --> 12:25.535
Cammy, listen to me,
listen to me.

12:26.736 --> 12:28.304
What? Who?

12:29.573 --> 12:31.040
Who did this to you?

12:32.342 --> 12:33.943
Cammy. Camarena.

12:34.778 --> 12:36.311
Cammy...

12:36.313 --> 12:37.814
I'm coming right now.

12:41.784 --> 12:42.986
Oh, fuck.

12:43.853 --> 12:45.386
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

13:22.226 --> 13:24.061
You gonna miss
this place, Joker?

13:24.861 --> 13:26.197
Probably not, homie.

13:28.365 --> 13:30.467
You know, I've been waiting
a long time for this.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.268
I talked to Berto.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.337
Everything's set.

13:35.972 --> 13:39.209
Then it's time for you to finish
your initiation, Capitan.

13:46.350 --> 13:47.418
She's smart.

13:49.052 --> 13:51.186
More dangerous than you think.

13:51.188 --> 13:53.888
Don't make the mistake
of underestimating her.

13:53.890 --> 13:55.491
I'll put the hit on the cousin,

13:56.492 --> 13:57.994
that will distract her.

13:58.962 --> 14:00.496
But I'll watch my back.

14:02.098 --> 14:05.001
You got this.
That's why I chose you.

14:09.172 --> 14:10.937
All I'm sayin' is
if it gets fucked up,

14:10.939 --> 14:13.076
you're not gonna get
a second chance.

14:20.350 --> 14:21.716
What?

14:21.718 --> 14:23.621
Somebody told me that
a long time ago.

14:25.087 --> 14:26.821
Yeah? Who's that?

14:26.823 --> 14:28.657
My cousin Elias.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.392
When I was 13.

14:30.394 --> 14:33.194
Pretty much all my mom's
boyfriends used to beat her.

14:33.196 --> 14:35.797
But there was this
one fool, Albert.

14:35.799 --> 14:38.034
One night, he hit her
with a pipe.

14:39.135 --> 14:40.638
I said enough was enough.

14:41.804 --> 14:44.672
So I told Elias what
I was gonna do.

14:44.674 --> 14:46.441
And word for word,

14:46.443 --> 14:48.575
he said the same thing.

14:48.577 --> 14:50.177
"Don't miss.

14:50.179 --> 14:52.415
You might not get
a second chance."

14:54.050 --> 14:56.383
So what happened?

14:56.385 --> 14:58.488
It's hard to miss with
a sawed-off shotgun.

14:59.489 --> 15:01.422
One shot.

15:01.424 --> 15:02.625
Fucking Joker.

15:05.928 --> 15:07.428
Gracias for everything.

15:07.430 --> 15:09.764
See you on the other side
of the glass when it's done.

15:09.766 --> 15:11.068
Yes, you will.

15:36.559 --> 15:40.261
- I'm happy you're out now.
- Hey. Gracias. How was the wedding?

15:40.263 --> 15:43.697
Party was crazy, dawg.
A lot of homies in the pinta.

15:43.699 --> 15:45.166
A lot of 'em dead.

15:45.168 --> 15:46.533
But now that you're out,

15:46.535 --> 15:48.902
let's clean up
the barrio, my boy.

15:48.904 --> 15:51.138
That's what I'm here for.

15:51.140 --> 15:53.676
I brought you something.
A little surprise.

15:56.011 --> 15:58.082
Come on, now. The bottom.

16:00.650 --> 16:01.651
Enjoy.

16:03.419 --> 16:04.722
Oh, hell nah.

16:10.659 --> 16:11.996
You ready to roll?

16:14.698 --> 16:16.598
Where are we headed?

16:46.596 --> 16:48.729
Fun night last night?

16:48.731 --> 16:51.099
Timon, gracias, dawg.
That show was the bomb.

16:51.101 --> 16:53.368
- You know how we do it.
- Like kings, homie.

16:53.370 --> 16:55.970
- Oh, shit, when you get that?
- Few months ago.

16:55.972 --> 16:57.505
So what, you want me
to call you Capitan now?

16:57.507 --> 17:00.041
Nah, nah, nah, I still
have another "jale" to do.

17:00.043 --> 17:02.375
- Orale, all right.
- You got that address for me?

17:02.377 --> 17:03.777
Got the address and the piece.

17:03.779 --> 17:06.680
I got it from the viejito's
house. It's amazing.

17:06.682 --> 17:08.949
- What's amazing?
- Casper didn't tell you?

17:08.951 --> 17:11.118
- Nah.
- My boy...

17:11.121 --> 17:14.188
- Check this shit out.
- Damn.

17:14.190 --> 17:18.492
- Beautiful, right?
- That shit is pretty nice.

17:18.493 --> 17:21.029
- -Let me know when you're ready.
We'll roll up.

17:21.031 --> 17:23.098
- Gracias.
- For the trip.

17:23.099 --> 17:24.267
Appreciate it.

17:40.217 --> 17:43.484
It's the back house. 408.

17:43.486 --> 17:46.620
- You sure?
- Positive. I clocked there for a week.

17:46.622 --> 17:49.424
Matter of fact, she works
right here down the street.

17:49.426 --> 17:52.260
She's purrty.
What you gonna do to her?

17:52.262 --> 17:54.395
Nothing much, holmes.

17:54.397 --> 17:57.167
- Chill right here. I'll be right back.
- Orale.

18:46.717 --> 18:47.751
Who's there?

18:49.151 --> 18:50.251
Hi, my name's Michael.

18:50.253 --> 18:51.586
- How are you?
- Hi.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.955
- My friend lives in the front.
- Who's that? Gizmo?

18:53.957 --> 18:56.157
Exactly. Anyways,
I need help moving

18:56.159 --> 18:58.091
this mattress and he's
not here right now.

18:58.093 --> 19:00.994
- Is there anyone here that can help me?
- Uh, no, no. Sorry.

19:00.996 --> 19:02.298
- So there's no one here?
- N...

19:13.008 --> 19:14.178
Feisty.

19:14.976 --> 19:16.043
Fuck you!

19:20.248 --> 19:22.016
No, please. Please, no!

19:22.018 --> 19:23.352
No!

19:33.830 --> 19:36.063
No!

19:36.065 --> 19:37.233
No.

19:39.436 --> 19:41.436
- That's right.
- No.

19:42.705 --> 19:43.674
Fuck!

19:44.673 --> 19:45.641
Fuck!

19:47.878 --> 19:49.810
When this is over...

19:49.812 --> 19:52.879
tell your cousin that there's
nowhere you're gonna be safe.

19:52.881 --> 19:57.453
I'm gonna keep coming back.
I'm doing this again and again.

19:58.254 --> 20:00.890
You got that?

20:01.992 --> 20:03.560
She did this to you.

20:50.974 --> 20:52.275
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

21:08.925 --> 21:10.027
Cammy?

22:46.555 --> 22:49.057
- I can't do this.
- You have to.

22:49.059 --> 22:50.394
No, I don't.

22:59.936 --> 23:02.672
They'll screen you for STDs
and give you the pill for free.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.509
I'm not fucking doing this.

23:09.778 --> 23:10.846
Fine.

23:13.248 --> 23:14.349
If I go in and get the pill,

23:14.351 --> 23:16.183
will you at least
agree to take it?

23:16.185 --> 23:17.521
Whatever.

23:27.863 --> 23:30.296
Hi, there.
What can I do for you?

23:30.298 --> 23:32.198
I want the morning after pill.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.471
- You've had unprotected sex in the last 24 hours?
- Yes.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.206
You know, if there's any suspicion of
domestic violence or sexual assault,

23:40.208 --> 23:41.576
I have to report it to the cops.

23:41.578 --> 23:42.946
It's the law.

23:43.845 --> 23:46.149
Oh, no. No, it's
nothing like that.

23:47.315 --> 23:48.684
I'm not talking about you.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.556
Oh, she's fine.

23:53.689 --> 23:55.592
And you won't be
seeing her anyway.

23:57.794 --> 23:59.627
Okay.

23:59.629 --> 24:01.128
Then you have
to speak to the nurse.

24:01.130 --> 24:03.667
Fill out these forms and I'll
need an ID for the prescription.

24:04.467 --> 24:05.701
Okay.

24:18.281 --> 24:19.249
Okay.

24:20.483 --> 24:21.985
The nurse'll see you now.

24:26.621 --> 24:28.123
You can follow me.

24:40.835 --> 24:43.337
You wanna tell me
what's going on, sweetie?

24:43.339 --> 24:44.541
Excuse me.

24:45.373 --> 24:46.876
I know that pill ain't for her.

24:49.911 --> 24:52.013
If somebody
sexually assaulted you,

24:52.015 --> 24:53.880
we have to do an exam.

24:53.882 --> 24:56.516
Screen for disease,
take a swab for DNA.

24:56.518 --> 24:59.320
If this guy's in the system,
he goes down.

24:59.322 --> 25:01.089
Simple as that.

25:01.091 --> 25:02.692
That's not gonna happen.

25:03.759 --> 25:04.724
Why not?

25:04.726 --> 25:07.596
Look, I'm not talking
to the cops.

25:08.864 --> 25:09.900
Then what?

25:10.999 --> 25:12.835
Just gonna wait till
this happens again?

25:14.036 --> 25:15.037
No.

25:17.207 --> 25:18.308
Then what?

25:21.710 --> 25:23.045
I don't know.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.716
Then let me help you.

25:28.883 --> 25:29.919
Please.

25:39.928 --> 25:41.931
Hi.

25:42.998 --> 25:44.266
How are we today?

25:45.901 --> 25:46.937
Not so good.

25:50.672 --> 25:51.941
What's that?

25:57.313 --> 25:58.614
The devil.

25:59.948 --> 26:00.984
Is that you?

26:11.659 --> 26:12.963
What's going on here?

26:13.996 --> 26:15.663
Nothing.

26:15.665 --> 26:16.866
Let's go.

26:18.266 --> 26:19.934
Hey...

26:19.936 --> 26:21.236
you're not helping her.

26:55.938 --> 26:57.638
Hi, this is Ruby Sommerset.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.342
Can I please speak
to Detective Redding?

27:16.824 --> 27:19.361
- Just... eat...
- No.

27:22.965 --> 27:25.702
- You need to eat.
- I'm not hungry.

27:32.140 --> 27:35.109
- We have to talk about this.
- Please, don't, Loca.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.811
Cammy...

27:36.813 --> 27:39.879
- Who'd wanna hurt you?
- Nobody.

27:39.881 --> 27:42.215
Maybe somebody's
been stalking you.

27:42.217 --> 27:44.718
- A guy from work or school.
- No, it's not that.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.486
- How can you be so sure?
- Because...

27:46.488 --> 27:49.055
Cammy, you obviously
know something.

27:49.057 --> 27:50.657
Whatever it is, just tell me.

27:50.659 --> 27:53.459
- I can't.
- There's no time for secrets.

27:56.232 --> 27:57.200
Fine.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.468
It's because of you.

28:02.170 --> 28:03.172
Me?

28:04.340 --> 28:06.775
- What do you mean?
- That's what he said.

28:08.276 --> 28:10.144
That you did this to me.

28:10.146 --> 28:13.580
And that he was gonna
keep coming back and doing it

28:13.582 --> 28:15.250
again and again.

28:16.686 --> 28:18.021
And that it was your fault.

28:21.591 --> 28:22.792
He said that?

28:24.659 --> 28:25.894
What did he look like?

28:27.396 --> 28:29.032
I don't know, he was tall.

28:30.298 --> 28:32.901
He was cut up
with tattoos all over.

28:34.636 --> 28:36.603
Can you remember any of them?

28:36.605 --> 28:38.974
I don't know. Not really.

28:41.243 --> 28:45.048
Actually... he had
a crown right here.

28:47.115 --> 28:49.818
I know because that's where
I was gonna stick the knife.

28:54.055 --> 28:56.823
- Might be RR.
- What's RR?

28:56.825 --> 28:58.591
A prison gang.

28:58.593 --> 28:59.862
Reyes Ricos.

29:00.896 --> 29:04.834
Actually, he had
an RR tattoo on his face.

29:06.936 --> 29:09.371
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?

29:10.538 --> 29:12.307
The RR coming after me.

29:13.476 --> 29:15.309
They were never our enemies.

29:15.311 --> 29:17.547
And they haven't been
around here in a long time.

29:20.983 --> 29:22.552
Can you remember anything else?

29:25.487 --> 29:26.789
His gun.

29:28.690 --> 29:30.559
It was shiny.

29:31.826 --> 29:33.860
But at the top it was all black,

29:33.862 --> 29:36.198
with roses carved
into the barrel.

29:38.935 --> 29:41.734
And on the handle

29:41.736 --> 29:44.871
there was this calavera skull

29:44.873 --> 29:47.308
in silver and gold.

29:53.114 --> 29:54.116
What?

29:57.053 --> 29:58.521
The calavera skull...

30:00.621 --> 30:02.723
was it set in diamonds?

30:02.725 --> 30:04.593
Yeah. How did you know?

30:07.629 --> 30:09.532
That gun used to belong to me.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.870
It was stolen the night
Manny was killed.

30:15.838 --> 30:17.473
I had never seen it again.

30:18.974 --> 30:21.311
What were you doing
with that fancy gun?

30:22.811 --> 30:24.447
It was a wedding present.

30:25.346 --> 30:28.450
So you, like,
killed people with it?

30:31.387 --> 30:33.286
Yes.

30:33.288 --> 30:35.522
So, a long time ago,
you killed someone

30:35.524 --> 30:37.590
and now I got raped for it?

30:37.592 --> 30:39.292
Cammy, I'm sorry.

30:39.294 --> 30:41.061
- Me too.
- I'll make it right.

30:41.063 --> 30:43.097
- Make it right?
- I'll cut his throat.

30:43.099 --> 30:45.869
And you think that's
gonna make it right?

31:43.626 --> 31:46.126
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have done that.

31:46.128 --> 31:48.396
If you wanna go to the cops,
I understand.

31:48.398 --> 31:51.697
- I'm not gonna stop you.
- I know.

31:51.699 --> 31:54.636
But, regardless, there is only
one way this is gonna end.

31:56.605 --> 31:57.707
Blood for blood.

32:00.876 --> 32:03.342
The police can't protect you.

32:03.344 --> 32:05.411
And you can?

32:05.413 --> 32:06.448
Yes.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.222
Blood for blood.

32:51.826 --> 32:53.496
Fifteen for everything?

32:57.399 --> 32:59.332
Great.

32:59.334 --> 33:01.371
I'll come by in an hour
to drop off the cash.

33:02.905 --> 33:04.140
Bye.

33:05.675 --> 33:06.642
Hey.

33:07.642 --> 33:08.745
Hey, want some breakfast?

33:09.844 --> 33:11.213
Yeah, okay.

33:23.758 --> 33:24.760
Thanks.

33:27.630 --> 33:30.533
- I need to go out for a little bit.
- What for?

33:31.400 --> 33:34.167
- Remember my friend, Carlos?
- Yeah.

33:34.169 --> 33:37.073
I called him for some
guns, for protection.

33:39.608 --> 33:43.144
I carry this 9 with me. But one
is not enough for both of us.

33:43.146 --> 33:47.617
Okay, but, Loca, I've never
really shot a gun before.

33:48.917 --> 33:50.786
It ain't hard. I'll show you.

33:54.923 --> 33:58.591
Why don't we just call
Nestor? Or Tito?

33:58.593 --> 34:00.127
Tell them what happened.

34:00.129 --> 34:02.096
They have guns
and they'll back us up.

34:02.098 --> 34:05.131
If we tell them, it will be
all out war with RR.

34:05.133 --> 34:06.734
- So?
- So if we do it that way,

34:06.736 --> 34:09.503
they will shoot first
and ask questions later.

34:09.505 --> 34:11.771
- Is that what you want?
- No, of course not.

34:11.773 --> 34:13.806
Then we have to be smart.

34:13.809 --> 34:16.678
And if this guy's acting alone,
I'll take him out myself.

34:17.746 --> 34:18.713
Okay.

34:23.516 --> 34:25.755
What's your connection
to the RR?

34:27.188 --> 34:30.226
Yesterday at the diner,
when it came up...

34:31.193 --> 34:33.463
it seemed like you knew
something more.

34:41.335 --> 34:43.639
Way back in the day,
I used to roll with one of them.

34:45.438 --> 34:47.541
But he got locked up for life.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.774
Who was he?

34:48.775 --> 34:51.545
I used to know him as Hugo,
but he always went by Casper.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.215
We did a bunch
of deals together.

34:55.217 --> 34:57.253
He was my friend
until he went away.

34:58.954 --> 35:00.553
But I had nothing
to do with that.

35:00.555 --> 35:03.021
Well, where is he locked up at?

35:03.023 --> 35:05.091
Crescent Valley, last I heard.

35:05.093 --> 35:06.593
Okay, well, then...

35:06.595 --> 35:09.495
if he's your friend, maybe we
could just go and talk to him.

35:09.497 --> 35:12.765
Cammy, that was ten years ago.

35:12.767 --> 35:14.603
Now he is locked up for life.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.606
I want to go with you
to buy the guns.

35:19.608 --> 35:21.408
- No.
- I don't want to be alone.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.376
It's safer for you to stay here.

35:23.378 --> 35:26.180
I really don't think
we should split up.

35:26.182 --> 35:27.783
This is the last time,
I promise.

35:30.820 --> 35:33.588
Now, eat and take a shower.
I'll be back before you know it.

35:36.457 --> 35:37.425
Fine.

36:58.039 --> 36:59.242
Loca.

37:53.628 --> 37:55.562
Hey, hey, hey,
take it easy, take it easy.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.599
Ma'am, ma'am, calm down. My name is
Detective Redding. I'm a police officer.

37:58.601 --> 38:00.300
- He's in there! He's in there!
- Who's in there?

38:00.302 --> 38:01.769
- He's trying to kill me!
- Somebody's...

38:01.771 --> 38:04.673
- He raped me! He's in the bathroom.
- Stay here.

39:08.769 --> 39:10.405
Hey, what's going on, Loca?

39:11.240 --> 39:13.606
- How have you been?
- I'm good.

39:13.608 --> 39:15.408
Can I get you anything?

39:15.410 --> 39:16.812
Nah, I'm good.

39:21.550 --> 39:23.686
- You're a lovely woman.
- Aww.

39:32.628 --> 39:34.463
You're gonna tell me
what's going on?

39:35.664 --> 39:37.396
Honestly, I don't
wanna get into it.

39:37.398 --> 39:39.834
You know, if you're in trouble,
maybe I can help you out, huh?

39:41.369 --> 39:43.037
Mm. I got it under control.

39:45.072 --> 39:48.709
You know, you're lucky. The connect
for the steel is coming in today.

39:48.711 --> 39:49.876
Who is it?

39:49.878 --> 39:52.812
You don't know him.
His name is Benzo.

39:52.814 --> 39:55.148
He's better than your hook-up.

39:55.150 --> 39:57.619
I've been moving a lot
of stuff lately, you know?

39:59.588 --> 40:02.722
You're acting weird, Loca.
What's going on?

40:02.724 --> 40:04.860
- Just please don't.
- Hey...

40:06.227 --> 40:08.428
you called me, huh.

40:08.430 --> 40:09.999
I don't wanna
get you involved, man.

40:11.198 --> 40:12.832
It's personal.

40:12.834 --> 40:15.838
I just came here to get
my regular bag and the guns.

40:18.439 --> 40:19.742
Okay.

40:25.713 --> 40:28.048
Just come back later today.

40:28.050 --> 40:31.720
You don't have to call. Just
be sure it's after 4 o'clock.

40:36.023 --> 40:37.159
Carlitos...

40:39.227 --> 40:40.463
come here.

40:50.104 --> 40:51.139
You feel better now?

40:53.374 --> 40:54.610
Not really.

40:56.744 --> 40:58.480
It was great for me, too.

41:07.122 --> 41:08.555
So what's this new hook-up?

41:08.557 --> 41:11.158
He's a friend of mine
from across the border.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.228
Name is Cuete.

41:13.461 --> 41:14.963
His uncle, Renaldo,

41:15.863 --> 41:18.698
he's a captain in the cartel.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.600
Did him a solid a while back,
and ever since then,

41:20.602 --> 41:22.238
they've been hooking me up,
you know?

41:24.037 --> 41:25.738
Oh, yeah?

41:25.740 --> 41:27.943
Best thing about it,
it's pure.

41:29.977 --> 41:32.180
I gotta step on it twice
before I put it on the street.

41:33.881 --> 41:36.515
You better be careful doing
business with the cartel.

41:36.517 --> 41:40.687
Nah, I get it from Cuete. It's his uncle
that's affiliated with the cartel.

41:40.689 --> 41:42.691
He gets it from him,
so it's legit.

41:43.557 --> 41:45.059
They don't even know who I am.

41:47.128 --> 41:50.564
- How are you moving all this?
- You know Angel from FSD?

41:50.566 --> 41:53.068
- Sort of.
- Moves a lot for me.

41:53.968 --> 41:55.871
And some fool
named Byron in Watts.

41:58.173 --> 42:00.109
Enemies working side by side?

42:01.276 --> 42:02.778
Black and brown together?

42:04.778 --> 42:06.148
What's the world coming to?

42:07.581 --> 42:08.917
Money talks, baby.

42:17.425 --> 42:19.091
You trust Angel?

42:19.093 --> 42:22.197
I don't have to trust Angel.
'Cause he buys drugs from me.

42:24.631 --> 42:26.267
I've never had
a problem with him.

42:28.403 --> 42:30.706
You sure you don't want to
tell me what's going on, Loca?

42:34.575 --> 42:35.910
Yeah, I'm sure.

42:36.878 --> 42:38.347
You know, if you need me, I...

42:39.546 --> 42:41.050
I'm always on a roll
with you, huh?

42:46.354 --> 42:49.058
Yeah, man. I appreciate it.

43:01.635 --> 43:03.236
Hey, buddy,
I got a favor to ask.

43:03.238 --> 43:04.373
Can you come down here a second?

43:05.372 --> 43:06.675
All right, thanks.

43:08.142 --> 43:10.178
He's just
gonna be a minute.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.981
Police stations look
a lot nicer on TV.

43:14.983 --> 43:18.151
I know, right? They make it look
like we work in an ad agency.

43:18.153 --> 43:20.753
- Or a trendy magazine.
- Sorry to disappoint.

43:22.858 --> 43:24.691
- Hey, what's up?
- I need you to run something for me.

43:24.693 --> 43:27.494
Inmate report on this guy
out in Crescent Valley.

43:27.496 --> 43:29.796
Goes by Casper,
first name, Hugo.

43:29.798 --> 43:32.631
And all the CV release records
in the past five years

43:32.633 --> 43:34.867
of anyone affiliated
to the Reyes Ricos.

43:34.869 --> 43:36.970
Shouldn't be a problem.

43:36.972 --> 43:40.073
- Should I even ask?
- Playin' a hunch.

43:40.075 --> 43:41.076
Hunch?

43:42.110 --> 43:43.178
Sure thing, Danny.

43:46.113 --> 43:48.349
You know, you've been through
a lot the last few days.

43:49.351 --> 43:50.950
You're lucky to be alive.

43:50.952 --> 43:54.120
It was a miracle
you showing up right then.

43:54.122 --> 43:55.890
Well, I was supposed
to go to the beach.

43:57.559 --> 44:01.995
- You know, I've never even been to the beach.
- Come on.

44:01.997 --> 44:04.800
People in my hood
don't really go too far.

44:07.968 --> 44:09.602
Do you have anyone else

44:09.604 --> 44:11.570
you can call
besides your cousin?

44:11.572 --> 44:14.307
I do, but, honestly...

44:14.309 --> 44:15.977
I'd rather just sit here.

44:17.044 --> 44:20.613
- If that's cool?
- Hey, totally.

44:20.615 --> 44:23.017
Hey, we can stay here
all night if you want.

44:26.053 --> 44:27.356
Are you close with Marisol?

44:28.356 --> 44:29.789
You mean, Loca?

44:29.791 --> 44:32.425
Marisol Flores is
what I got from Ruby.

44:32.427 --> 44:34.762
Nobody's ever called her that.

44:35.564 --> 44:36.899
Not even her own mother.

44:37.698 --> 44:39.467
Too bad. It's a pretty name.

44:40.468 --> 44:41.803
Marie of the Light.

44:43.104 --> 44:45.037
Or Sun.

44:45.039 --> 44:48.908
- Sol means "sun" in Spanish, right?
- Yeah, it does, but...

44:48.910 --> 44:53.912
Marisol actually means "Mary
of the Solitude." Not "Sun."

44:53.914 --> 44:56.418
And trust me,
it suits her a lot better.

45:02.423 --> 45:03.492
Who's that?

45:07.028 --> 45:09.164
I'm sorry.
Is it rude of me to ask?

45:11.298 --> 45:12.367
Nah, it's okay.

45:14.769 --> 45:16.702
Lawanda is a cold case.

45:16.704 --> 45:19.071
Which means it will
probably never get solved.

45:19.073 --> 45:20.372
Why is that?

45:20.374 --> 45:24.577
Pending new evidence,
we just don't have the manpower.

45:24.579 --> 45:27.213
So I pick 'em up
in my spare time.

45:27.215 --> 45:30.052
- You ever solved one?
- Sure I have.

45:33.621 --> 45:35.490
So how do you even start?

45:37.559 --> 45:39.227
Well, for example...

45:41.930 --> 45:43.997
I'll stare at this photo,

45:43.999 --> 45:46.468
this vision of the past.

45:47.970 --> 45:50.970
And I see the life
behind her eyes.

45:50.972 --> 45:53.508
I wonder who her friends were,
who her family was.

45:54.976 --> 45:57.445
Then I try to find them,
talk to them.

45:59.180 --> 46:01.747
Though the odds are
stacked against me, I...

46:01.749 --> 46:03.349
I have to believe
the whole time

46:03.351 --> 46:06.021
I'm gonna find the son of a bitch
who killed this little girl...

46:07.122 --> 46:08.857
because she's
someone's daughter.

46:11.258 --> 46:13.928
And no one but me is gonna do
a damn thing about it.

46:15.829 --> 46:17.696
It's comforting.

46:17.698 --> 46:18.830
What?

46:18.832 --> 46:21.533
Knowing you exist.

46:21.535 --> 46:25.537
Putting murderers away on your
spare time, like a superhero.

46:25.539 --> 46:27.375
No, I'm no hero.

46:29.811 --> 46:32.847
- Just Newton's Third Law.
- Newton's Third Law?

46:34.414 --> 46:38.219
Every action has an equal
and opposing reaction.

46:39.253 --> 46:40.488
What I do...

46:41.822 --> 46:43.090
is just science.

46:48.063 --> 46:49.331
Here's your files, boss.

46:56.637 --> 46:58.504
Are you ready?

46:58.506 --> 46:59.575
I think so.

47:18.827 --> 47:20.095
Stop.

47:22.898 --> 47:24.265
That's him.

48:10.044 --> 48:11.745
Tell us what
happened to Cuete!

48:13.247 --> 48:15.347
Tell us what
you did to him!

48:15.349 --> 48:18.818
Look, I don't know anything.

48:18.820 --> 48:19.852
Fuck you!

48:20.988 --> 48:22.754
Cuete's dead!

48:22.756 --> 48:24.693
You hear me? Dead!

48:25.693 --> 48:27.093
That's what you're gonna be,

48:27.095 --> 48:29.129
unless you tell us
what we want to know.

48:34.102 --> 48:36.836
I don't know nothing, man.

48:36.838 --> 48:38.338
Who are you working with?

48:38.340 --> 48:40.705
Who are you dealing to?

48:40.707 --> 48:41.976
Angel.

48:42.776 --> 48:44.278
I work with a guy named Angel.

48:45.912 --> 48:47.215
From FSD.

48:49.282 --> 48:51.519
Some black guy
in Watts named Byron.

48:53.488 --> 48:55.488
You tell Ronaldo...

48:55.490 --> 48:57.157
I didn't kill Cuete.

48:57.159 --> 48:59.528
I would never disrespect
the cartel like that, huh.

49:00.727 --> 49:02.028
Cuete was my friend, man.

49:02.030 --> 49:04.129
- Who else are you dealing to?
- Nobody.

49:04.131 --> 49:05.898
We saw a girl
leave here earlier!

49:05.900 --> 49:08.300
No, no, no.
Sh-She's nobody, man.

49:08.302 --> 49:11.271
You fucking liar!

49:52.880 --> 49:54.148
Carlos...

51:04.686 --> 51:07.521
I just heard some gunshots
coming from a car garage.

51:08.889 --> 51:11.423
775, East California Street.

51:11.425 --> 51:12.427
Hurry.

51:41.655 --> 51:42.756
Yeah?

51:45.992 --> 51:47.261
What?

51:49.030 --> 51:50.298
When?

51:52.900 --> 51:54.269
Fuck.

51:55.470 --> 51:56.505
All right.

52:06.180 --> 52:07.780
'Sup, ese?

52:07.782 --> 52:09.918
Yeah, I need you to come
over here right now.

52:11.651 --> 52:12.787
Call Oso.

52:13.988 --> 52:15.456
Shit just got real.

53:24.291 --> 53:26.191
- 'Sup, ese?
- Wassup, dawg?

53:26.193 --> 53:27.859
Say, check this out, homie.

53:27.861 --> 53:31.963
That's Peaches' cousin.
Oh, I fucked her.

53:31.965 --> 53:33.534
You're a fool, homie.

53:36.169 --> 53:37.970
What's with the look, homie?

53:37.972 --> 53:39.504
Just got the call...

53:39.506 --> 53:41.372
Carlos Santiago is dead.

53:41.374 --> 53:44.343
Sss, shit. What, you think
he gave you up?

53:44.345 --> 53:46.278
How could he?

53:46.280 --> 53:50.216
He don't know anything.
But there's more.

53:50.218 --> 53:53.619
Two cartel soldiers were
found dead in his place.

53:53.621 --> 53:56.388
Somebody who made off with the
gang are blowing their money.

53:56.390 --> 53:58.457
Wait, so two guys
are dead, homie?

53:58.459 --> 54:00.829
- I know, right?
- What the fuck happened, homie?

54:01.762 --> 54:03.697
Someone else
got involved, holmes.

54:04.497 --> 54:06.497
Some "Act of God" shit.

54:06.499 --> 54:08.434
What's our next move, dawg?

54:08.436 --> 54:10.769
We gotta find out
who killed these guys.

54:10.771 --> 54:13.275
And who made off with
all that fucking money.

54:15.642 --> 54:16.908
Hey,

54:16.910 --> 54:19.311
remember that fool
from San Ysidro, dawg?

54:19.313 --> 54:23.182
Gave him right across the border back
in the day for, like, 200 bucks?

54:23.184 --> 54:24.749
Gave him that fucked up
eye, dawg?

54:24.751 --> 54:25.950
Yeah, I remember.

54:25.952 --> 54:27.988
Think about that fool
sometimes, you know?

54:29.657 --> 54:32.423
- Why?
- After all this time when we're like, he's...

54:32.425 --> 54:34.492
he's still gone.

54:34.494 --> 54:37.129
And we're still here,
you know, like...

54:37.131 --> 54:41.267
- Yeah, well, you don't know that for sure, holmes.
- Nah, nah, nah.

54:41.269 --> 54:44.068
I think we both know that
he's... dead, fool.

54:44.070 --> 54:45.673
Just like Cuete, fool.

54:46.474 --> 54:48.240
Boy's gone, homie.

54:48.242 --> 54:49.477
Like all of us...

54:50.276 --> 54:51.612
eventually.

54:53.081 --> 54:54.814
Fucking, holmes.

54:54.816 --> 54:56.818
At least we got
our 200 bucks, you know?

54:58.019 --> 55:01.486
If it wasn't us, it would
have been somebody else.

55:01.488 --> 55:05.222
Fuck, homie, for 200 bucks,
dawg, back then...

55:05.224 --> 55:06.894
we thought we were rich, holmes.

55:09.396 --> 55:11.565
Maybe we were, you know,
in our own way.

55:17.405 --> 55:19.504
Hey, it's Peaches, homie.

55:19.506 --> 55:21.675
Hey, what's up?
I can't talk right now, baby.

56:58.606 --> 57:00.108
You sure this is gonna work?

57:02.876 --> 57:03.878
No.

57:05.246 --> 57:07.081
But we don't have another play.

57:09.215 --> 57:10.484
Then let's do it.

57:57.831 --> 57:58.832
Fuck.

58:00.367 --> 58:01.968
Come on, baby.

58:06.307 --> 58:07.675
Hello, 'ello.

58:09.811 --> 58:10.845
Right now?

58:11.979 --> 58:14.148
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

58:16.749 --> 58:20.385
I have to go scoop up Angel.
Something's up.

58:20.387 --> 58:22.220
Now?

58:22.222 --> 58:23.557
Yeah, right now.

58:28.829 --> 58:29.863
Fuck.

58:48.983 --> 58:51.950
Thank you for using...
health products.

58:51.952 --> 58:54.885
Please relax during measurement.

58:54.887 --> 58:57.257
Please... while using this drug.

59:17.512 --> 59:18.979
Hey, open up, it's me.

59:26.686 --> 59:29.088
- What?
- You're not gonna fucking believe this.

59:29.090 --> 59:30.224
- What?
- Follow me.

59:31.492 --> 59:33.892
Shit.

59:33.894 --> 59:37.595
- Oh, that fucking bitch!
- Do you see what I'm talking about?

59:37.597 --> 59:41.733
Can you fucking believe this? In our
neighborhood? The fucking balls on this bitch!

59:41.735 --> 59:43.901
- Something weird's going on.
- Yeah.

59:43.903 --> 59:45.671
That pollo negro
has gone crazy, eh?

59:45.673 --> 59:47.006
Seriously. Bulldog left
this morning,

59:47.008 --> 59:48.941
said something was up
with Angel, and then this?

59:48.943 --> 59:50.776
- Un-huh.
- It's like she's trying to send me a message.

59:50.778 --> 59:54.079
- Yeah, she's taunting you, yo.
- Yeah, but she didn't really cross me out.

59:54.081 --> 59:55.082
- Yeah...
- Hold up.

59:55.881 --> 59:57.651
I'm gonna take care of this.

01:00:03.758 --> 01:00:06.791
It's Peaches, dawg. Hey, what's up?
I can't talk right now.

01:00:06.793 --> 01:00:11.095
- Baby, you know that Loca bitch that fucked up my face?
- Hey, calm down.

01:00:11.097 --> 01:00:13.733
- 'Sup?
- Yeah, well, she tagged our piece out front.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:15.767
- Oh, yeah?
- Out front of the house!

01:00:15.769 --> 01:00:17.769
Is that right?

01:00:17.771 --> 01:00:22.707
Hey, hold on. Hey, you know some bitch
named Loca from Los Grajos neighborhood?

01:00:22.709 --> 01:00:27.945
- Yeah. Why?
- Peaches just said she hit up a piece in the barrio, fool.

01:00:27.947 --> 01:00:30.717
Say, we gotta go down there
and check it out, homie. You in?

01:00:32.919 --> 01:00:34.619
Hey, we'll meet you
right there, all right?

01:00:34.621 --> 01:00:36.423
- Yeah, like now.
- All right.

01:00:38.025 --> 01:00:41.959
Hey, Peaches won 500 bucks on
a scratcher last week, dawg.

01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:43.796
Got some new kicks, fool.

01:00:43.798 --> 01:00:47.099
Loca and I throw down, she
beats my ass, and then this?

01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:48.899
- Why?
- She's stupid, yo.

01:00:48.901 --> 01:00:51.568
Nah, Loca ain't stupid.
Nah, you stupid.

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:53.673
All right, then. She got a play.

01:00:53.675 --> 01:00:56.008
Yeah, of course she does.
But Loca's OG though.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:58.175
She wouldn't do nothin' like
this unless she had a reason.

01:00:58.177 --> 01:01:01.646
Does it really matter, though?
I mean, you gotta smash her.

01:01:01.648 --> 01:01:03.182
- But you know how we do it.
- Yeah.

01:01:03.184 --> 01:01:05.350
- ♪ Two steps ahead ♪
- Yeah, exactly.

01:01:05.352 --> 01:01:07.419
- Two steps ahead.
- It's so fucking on!

01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:11.189
You know where she stay at? 'Cause we
could take care of this right now.

01:01:11.191 --> 01:01:13.061
Nah, I only know one place
she might be.

01:01:25.072 --> 01:01:26.204
Si.

01:01:29.977 --> 01:01:31.575
Hey...

01:01:31.577 --> 01:01:32.977
Can I help you, friend?

01:01:32.979 --> 01:01:34.247
I don't need nothing.

01:01:37.284 --> 01:01:39.249
Well...

01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:40.818
Well...

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.055
You can either
order a drink or...

01:01:43.057 --> 01:01:43.954
leave.

01:01:43.956 --> 01:01:45.823
We don't want any trouble.

01:01:45.825 --> 01:01:48.195
Take a walk, old man.
Doesn't concern you.

01:01:52.265 --> 01:01:55.934
You know what? Everything
that happens in this bar

01:01:55.936 --> 01:01:57.838
concerns me.

01:02:03.343 --> 01:02:05.847
- Get the fuck outta here.
- It's cool, Tony.

01:02:06.646 --> 01:02:08.113
- I got this.
- Loca...

01:02:08.115 --> 01:02:12.283
Just go, seriously.
Before you get us both killed.

01:02:12.285 --> 01:02:16.189
I promise. No blood
will be spilled. Not here.

01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:21.425
Look, I've had a rough week.

01:02:21.427 --> 01:02:24.364
I don't know if I can handle being
banished from my favorite bar.

01:02:26.532 --> 01:02:27.534
You sure?

01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:30.037
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:02:35.608 --> 01:02:36.943
Acuerdate.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.278
Before anyone does
anything stupid,

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.115
let me explain why you're here.

01:03:16.117 --> 01:03:20.352
Then if you still want to, we can settle
our differences out in the parking lot.

01:03:20.354 --> 01:03:22.588
And how do you
propose we do that?

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:24.890
No guns, no weapons.

01:03:24.892 --> 01:03:26.227
Just you and me.

01:03:27.727 --> 01:03:29.593
Orale, negra.

01:03:29.595 --> 01:03:31.064
Where's your boy Angel at?

01:03:31.865 --> 01:03:33.564
Why do you want to know?

01:03:33.566 --> 01:03:37.503
Because he murdered a nephew to the
cartel and I got tangled up in it.

01:03:37.505 --> 01:03:40.106
This is bullshit. She's lying.

01:03:46.213 --> 01:03:47.713
Angel.

01:03:47.715 --> 01:03:50.015
- Loca.
- Are you serious?

01:03:50.017 --> 01:03:52.249
- You know her?
- Shut the fuck up, Inez.

01:03:52.251 --> 01:03:54.322
What's she talkin' about
the cartel, man?

01:03:55.923 --> 01:03:58.390
- Tell them about Cuete.
- Yo, what about Cuete?

01:03:58.392 --> 01:04:02.294
- You ax Cuete, fool?
- Do you know what they'll do to us?

01:04:02.296 --> 01:04:04.930
- To our families?
- You gonna point that at me

01:04:04.932 --> 01:04:06.832
you better be ready
to use it, little girl.

01:04:06.834 --> 01:04:08.834
I was born ready, motherfucker!

01:04:08.836 --> 01:04:10.202
You kill both of them

01:04:10.204 --> 01:04:12.905
- and the cartel will back down.
- Everybody just chill!

01:04:12.907 --> 01:04:15.774
- Oso, put the gun down, homie.
- The gun down?

01:04:15.776 --> 01:04:18.776
I'm not gonna die because this
motherfucker had some old beef with Cuete,

01:04:18.778 --> 01:04:20.111
and that bitch got
caught up in it.

01:04:20.113 --> 01:04:21.479
No one is going to shoot anybody

01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:23.782
because I am the one with
the money and their product.

01:04:23.784 --> 01:04:26.486
And two bodies won't make them
feel better without their loot.

01:04:28.021 --> 01:04:29.390
So put the guns down.

01:04:32.593 --> 01:04:34.325
Okay.

01:04:34.327 --> 01:04:35.626
I killed him.

01:04:35.628 --> 01:04:39.229
It was personal. And
that's all I'm gonna say.

01:04:39.231 --> 01:04:43.436
And I didn't mean for this shit to come back
on Carlos or any of us for that matter.

01:04:44.604 --> 01:04:46.303
I had it all sorted out.

01:04:46.305 --> 01:04:49.506
I was gonna pin it
on the Barreras cartel.

01:04:49.508 --> 01:04:53.343
Just didn't have time.
Soldiers moved in too quick.

01:04:53.345 --> 01:04:55.379
By the time I got there,
it was too late.

01:04:55.381 --> 01:04:58.550
I heard them asking questions
about you and Cuete.

01:04:58.552 --> 01:05:01.088
And Carlos had no idea
what they were talking about.

01:05:02.988 --> 01:05:04.525
They tied him up in a chair...

01:05:05.793 --> 01:05:07.193
and blew his head off.

01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:11.364
Then they came after me.

01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:14.832
I had no choice.

01:05:14.834 --> 01:05:17.334
- Why were you there?
- I needed guns.

01:05:17.336 --> 01:05:21.939
A few days ago, a psycho from the RR
got released from Crescent Valley

01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:24.108
- and raped my cousin.
- Jesus.

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:26.413
Put it on me for some reason
I still don't know.

01:05:27.447 --> 01:05:30.016
He was following us,
stalking us.

01:05:31.385 --> 01:05:33.486
So I needed protection,
so I called Carlos.

01:05:34.655 --> 01:05:36.854
He's the only one I trusted.

01:05:36.856 --> 01:05:38.590
We didn't want
anyone else to know.

01:05:38.592 --> 01:05:40.658
Why not? You still got access
to muscle, don't you?

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.697
Of course, I do.
But I don't want another war.

01:05:44.898 --> 01:05:47.001
And now this cartel thing
is now on me too.

01:05:49.102 --> 01:05:50.438
But there's a way out.

01:05:57.943 --> 01:05:59.579
I got about 100 more of those.

01:06:01.213 --> 01:06:03.749
The cartel is coming for us,

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:05.052
all of us.

01:06:06.186 --> 01:06:08.186
But I have a plan.

01:06:08.188 --> 01:06:10.923
And in order to pull it off,
we need to work together.

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:14.858
So stop pretending we're so different just
because we come from different blocks.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.727
And why would we do that?

01:06:16.729 --> 01:06:20.101
For the same reason I'm not gonna kill
this motherfucker where he stands.

01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:23.237
Manage a common enemy...

01:06:24.104 --> 01:06:26.037
plus, if my plan works,

01:06:26.039 --> 01:06:27.872
we'll get the cartel
off our backs,

01:06:27.874 --> 01:06:31.344
and exact vengeance against the RR
for what was done to my cousin.

01:06:32.178 --> 01:06:34.345
We split everything equal.

01:06:34.347 --> 01:06:36.213
Seven ways.

01:06:36.215 --> 01:06:38.082
There's only six of us.

01:06:38.084 --> 01:06:39.519
My cousin Cammy.

01:06:40.753 --> 01:06:42.586
She gets a share.

01:06:42.588 --> 01:06:44.291
But she's not
gonna get involved.

01:06:54.133 --> 01:06:56.803
This is the guy... Joker.

01:06:58.372 --> 01:07:00.174
You think you can find him?

01:07:01.608 --> 01:07:03.975
Might take a day or two.

01:07:03.977 --> 01:07:06.311
Let's say we put
our differences aside

01:07:06.313 --> 01:07:08.381
and we get this
motherfucker, Joker...

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:11.082
then what?

01:07:11.084 --> 01:07:13.687
How is that gonna help us
get rid of the cartel?

01:07:37.811 --> 01:07:39.113
Here you go.

01:07:45.651 --> 01:07:47.084
What are you packing?

01:07:47.086 --> 01:07:48.852
What do you mean,
I got a 9 in there.

01:07:52.992 --> 01:07:54.959
Asshole.

01:07:54.961 --> 01:07:56.361
Before you shoot...

01:07:56.363 --> 01:07:57.562
...make sure you pull that.

01:07:57.564 --> 01:08:00.599
You got a laser sight
right on top.

01:08:00.601 --> 01:08:02.800
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:08:02.802 --> 01:08:05.606
- So where is this place?
- It's right down the corner.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.405
How is it gonna go down?

01:08:08.407 --> 01:08:10.841
Me and you are gonna
cover the back.

01:08:10.843 --> 01:08:12.711
Bulldog is gonna
cover the front.

01:08:12.713 --> 01:08:14.448
Peaches, getaway driver.

01:08:15.347 --> 01:08:18.381
- You got that?
- Yeah.

01:08:18.384 --> 01:08:20.420
- You guys ready?
- Let's do it. Let's go.

01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:25.312
Drop it, Joker.

01:10:26.112 --> 01:10:27.377
Fuck you.

01:10:27.379 --> 01:10:28.848
You have five seconds.

01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:31.882
Four...

01:10:31.884 --> 01:10:33.751
Three...

01:10:33.753 --> 01:10:34.755
Two...

01:10:54.406 --> 01:10:55.608
Who gave this to you?

01:10:57.844 --> 01:10:59.644
You stupid bitch.

01:10:59.646 --> 01:11:01.348
You still don't get it, do you?

01:11:02.415 --> 01:11:03.883
Why'd you do it, Joker?

01:11:05.285 --> 01:11:07.421
Same reason as you, ese.

01:11:08.589 --> 01:11:09.555
Nah.

01:11:10.924 --> 01:11:12.724
Venganza.

01:11:12.726 --> 01:11:14.659
Revenge for what?

01:11:14.661 --> 01:11:16.062
Old deeds, Loca.

01:11:18.798 --> 01:11:21.835
It was the last thing I had
to do to earn my crown.

01:11:23.437 --> 01:11:25.435
For Casper...

01:11:25.437 --> 01:11:28.007
he was much more...

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:32.243
But the crown,

01:11:32.245 --> 01:11:33.514
is for life.

01:11:34.313 --> 01:11:36.814
So both of you motherfuckers

01:11:36.816 --> 01:11:38.885
are dead.

01:11:40.954 --> 01:11:42.456
Why you didn't finish it?

01:11:50.429 --> 01:11:52.066
I'll let him know you failed.

01:12:37.143 --> 01:12:39.142
A long time ago

01:12:39.144 --> 01:12:40.813
I memorized this quote.

01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:45.385
"The true gentleman...

01:12:46.754 --> 01:12:49.990
is the one whose conduct
proceeds from good will...

01:12:51.157 --> 01:12:54.394
and an acute
sense of propriety.

01:12:56.295 --> 01:12:57.530
Whose self-control...

01:12:58.665 --> 01:13:00.868
is equal to all emergencies.

01:13:03.469 --> 01:13:05.705
Who does not make
the poor man...

01:13:06.505 --> 01:13:08.642
conscious of his poverty...

01:13:10.343 --> 01:13:13.714
the obscure man
of his obscurity...

01:13:14.714 --> 01:13:18.051
or any man of his inferiority...

01:13:19.052 --> 01:13:20.454
or deformity.

01:13:22.255 --> 01:13:25.758
A man for whom honor
is sacred...

01:13:27.326 --> 01:13:30.129
and virtue safe."

01:13:37.237 --> 01:13:38.806
Are you this sort of man...

01:13:39.872 --> 01:13:41.674
Angel Ferraro?

01:13:44.844 --> 01:13:45.878
Nah.

01:13:48.781 --> 01:13:50.547
Nah?

01:13:50.549 --> 01:13:54.654
Wow. Well, that...
makes me curious.

01:13:56.321 --> 01:13:58.489
Because most men say yes.

01:13:58.491 --> 01:14:02.228
It's impossible to be both honest
and ruthless at the same time.

01:14:03.862 --> 01:14:06.329
If you're asking
if you could trust me,

01:14:06.331 --> 01:14:10.267
well, that's just something you're
gonna have to figure out on your own.

01:14:10.269 --> 01:14:12.971
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Since we are, after all,

01:14:12.973 --> 01:14:16.673
the remainder of a very large,
bloody equation.

01:14:16.675 --> 01:14:19.476
There must be a reason
I'm sitting here.

01:14:19.478 --> 01:14:20.680
Yeah.

01:14:22.848 --> 01:14:23.916
Fair enough.

01:14:25.652 --> 01:14:27.588
So let's go back
to the beginning.

01:14:29.222 --> 01:14:30.590
And you must tell me...

01:14:32.258 --> 01:14:33.861
what happened to my nephew...

01:14:35.027 --> 01:14:35.995
Cuete?

01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:39.562
He was murdered
by an RR soldier,

01:14:39.564 --> 01:14:41.432
a guy named Joker.

01:14:41.434 --> 01:14:43.266
He was an old friend
of Carlos Santiago

01:14:43.268 --> 01:14:47.605
and went to him to try to set up a coke
business after a seven-year stretch.

01:14:47.607 --> 01:14:51.577
A direct order from
an RR captain in CV.

01:14:52.379 --> 01:14:53.780
A guy named Casper.

01:14:54.647 --> 01:14:56.280
When Joker found out

01:14:56.282 --> 01:15:00.187
that Cuete was Carlos'
connection to the blow...

01:15:01.353 --> 01:15:03.220
there was a change of plans.

01:15:03.222 --> 01:15:07.158
He set a meet and murdered him
behind Carlos' back.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.161
Why?

01:15:09.262 --> 01:15:10.662
Why did he do that?

01:15:10.664 --> 01:15:12.099
The story I heard...

01:15:14.401 --> 01:15:16.868
is that your nephew
did something to him

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:19.369
while he was in
the Youth Authority, locked up.

01:15:19.371 --> 01:15:21.338
Way back.

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:22.608
Yeah, well...

01:15:24.076 --> 01:15:26.079
he was always a sick boy.

01:15:27.213 --> 01:15:28.980
And what about my men?

01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:32.016
When Joker showed up at Carlos'
house and killed your men,

01:15:32.018 --> 01:15:35.919
he must have figured out
it was just a matter of time

01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:39.957
before you would do the same
to me and my crew.

01:15:39.959 --> 01:15:43.630
Enough people knew that me and
Carlos were doing business together.

01:15:44.664 --> 01:15:47.731
Sooner or later,
you would have figured it out.

01:15:47.733 --> 01:15:49.934
Of course, I couldn't
let that happen.

01:15:49.936 --> 01:15:52.535
So me and my people
hunted him down

01:15:52.537 --> 01:15:54.504
and we got your stuff for you.

01:15:54.506 --> 01:15:56.043
So now, they are both dead...

01:15:58.143 --> 01:16:02.748
and I'm talking to you and you
apparently have my goods.

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:06.152
Is that a coincidence?

01:16:07.385 --> 01:16:10.354
Nah. Not a coincidence at all.

01:16:10.356 --> 01:16:12.992
It ended up this way so that
me and you can make a deal.

01:16:13.793 --> 01:16:15.592
What kind of deal?

01:16:15.594 --> 01:16:18.195
One that's based
on mutual respect.

01:16:18.197 --> 01:16:21.766
And how did you
so eloquently say, huh?

01:16:21.768 --> 01:16:25.235
"Where honor is sacred
and virtue safe."

01:16:28.206 --> 01:16:29.843
Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:32.478 --> 01:16:33.714
Okay.

01:16:35.247 --> 01:16:36.717
You have my attention.

01:16:39.184 --> 01:16:40.952
What are you proposing?

01:16:40.954 --> 01:16:44.858
Your boys killed an innocent man
who happened to be my friend.

01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:47.592
To answer for this atrocity,

01:16:47.594 --> 01:16:50.060
instead of avenging
him in blood,

01:16:50.062 --> 01:16:54.064
I want you and your people
to stay away from our blocks.

01:16:54.066 --> 01:16:57.403
Not just my blocks,
all of South Central.

01:17:01.308 --> 01:17:03.074
You ask a lot.

01:17:03.076 --> 01:17:06.276
I just don't want us
to kill each other anymore.

01:17:06.278 --> 01:17:09.713
For that, I will forgive
the murder of my friend.

01:17:09.715 --> 01:17:14.351
And I guarantee to move
500 keys a month

01:17:14.353 --> 01:17:15.921
through my network.

01:17:16.923 --> 01:17:19.657
You promise a lot, too.

01:17:19.659 --> 01:17:21.693
I formed some unique alliances

01:17:21.695 --> 01:17:24.428
with every major player
from Compton,

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:25.898
Inglewood, Watts,

01:17:26.698 --> 01:17:28.600
all the way to the North Valley.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:32.872
Everyone's on board with the ceasefire...
if this goes through.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.942
What about my nephew?

01:17:37.242 --> 01:17:39.043
What about his blood?

01:17:39.045 --> 01:17:42.747
You'll just have to take that up
with Casper up at CV.

01:17:42.749 --> 01:17:45.717
After all, he's the one that
went behind your back.

01:17:45.719 --> 01:17:47.721
He caused all this mess
in the first place.

01:17:55.896 --> 01:17:58.997
Here's a show of how important
this arrangement is to us.

01:17:58.999 --> 01:18:04.004
Consider it a token of goodwill from the
newly-formed South Central Syndicate.

01:18:14.613 --> 01:18:15.915
Suppose...

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:19.682
that I believe...

01:18:19.684 --> 01:18:22.653
that it was you who
set up this whole thing,

01:18:22.655 --> 01:18:24.224
and not some...

01:18:25.558 --> 01:18:28.426
RR captain at CV.

01:18:28.428 --> 01:18:32.232
Suppose that, but consider
for a moment the future.

01:18:33.398 --> 01:18:35.266
We both lost a lot in this,

01:18:35.268 --> 01:18:38.868
but I'm sitting right here,
ready to shake your hand,

01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:40.473
and give you back what's yours.

01:18:42.041 --> 01:18:44.976
Does it make any sense
that I would kill your men

01:18:44.978 --> 01:18:48.181
and then come here
and return your goods, huh?

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:52.016
Does it really matter?

01:18:52.018 --> 01:18:54.519
There's a lot of money
to be made if we work together,

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:56.252
starting now.

01:19:13.807 --> 01:19:15.142
Tell me something...

01:19:16.675 --> 01:19:17.977
Angel Ferraro...

01:19:20.347 --> 01:19:23.784
Do you believe the world
is getting more civilized?

01:19:26.219 --> 01:19:27.387
Probably not.

01:19:28.687 --> 01:19:29.889
Probably not.

01:19:34.093 --> 01:19:35.061
Yeah.

01:19:35.862 --> 01:19:37.130
Probably not.

01:20:16.536 --> 01:20:17.537
Joker is dead.

01:20:20.071 --> 01:20:22.241
After he raped my cousin,
I crewed up.

01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:26.479
Because of what you've done...

01:20:28.481 --> 01:20:29.582
your life is over.

01:20:32.885 --> 01:20:35.254
When I met you, Loca,
you were 12 years old.

01:20:36.856 --> 01:20:38.090
You remember?

01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:40.994
Of course I remember.

01:20:42.362 --> 01:20:43.463
Where were we?

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:46.332
I went to visit my cousin in YA.

01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:48.468
That's right.

01:20:53.305 --> 01:20:56.343
After I got out, the next time
I saw you, you were 15.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.514
Most beautiful thing
I had ever seen.

01:21:03.182 --> 01:21:04.317
Just...

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.220
perfect.

01:21:14.594 --> 01:21:15.929
And you knew.

01:21:17.562 --> 01:21:20.765
Even then I know you knew
the power you had over me.

01:21:24.103 --> 01:21:27.672
You used me. You fucking
used me to do your dirty work.

01:21:27.674 --> 01:21:32.042
- How did I use you, Hugo?
- Two black males, Franklin Ave., double homicide.

01:21:32.044 --> 01:21:33.243
The ones you said robbed you,

01:21:33.245 --> 01:21:34.912
which was
a flat out fucking lie.

01:21:34.914 --> 01:21:36.316
Franklin Avenue?

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:40.220
- You never got caught for those.
- Caught for them?

01:21:42.155 --> 01:21:43.689
I have to live with them, Loca.

01:21:45.558 --> 01:21:47.024
I see their faces.

01:21:47.026 --> 01:21:48.561
Out of all the bodies...

01:21:49.562 --> 01:21:51.064
those are the faces you see?

01:21:53.031 --> 01:21:55.164
We were a team.
We were dealing together.

01:21:55.166 --> 01:21:57.001
I was young and I
wanted those blocks.

01:21:57.003 --> 01:21:59.371
- I never used yo...
- Fuck that!

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.043
Just admit it.

01:22:04.242 --> 01:22:05.810
Admit you knew
I was crazy about you,

01:22:05.812 --> 01:22:09.015
that you manipulated me because
you knew I was in love with you.

01:22:09.982 --> 01:22:11.317
In love with me?

01:22:13.986 --> 01:22:15.388
You never said anything.

01:22:21.628 --> 01:22:23.295
You fucking coward.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.233
Why my cousin?

01:22:29.768 --> 01:22:31.200
It's not your style.

01:22:31.202 --> 01:22:33.272
He wasn't supposed to rape her.

01:22:35.139 --> 01:22:37.874
Just scare her,
so you'd come running.

01:22:37.876 --> 01:22:39.512
He tried to kill her, Hugo.

01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:42.615
It was just supposed to be you.

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:45.452
Why?

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:49.055
For Christian.

01:22:54.159 --> 01:22:55.996
He was my half-brother.

01:22:57.295 --> 01:22:58.365
My blood.

01:22:59.965 --> 01:23:02.266
My dad had an affair
with his mom.

01:23:02.268 --> 01:23:04.537
He tried to keep it secret,
but everybody knew.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.375
And you killed him.

01:23:10.777 --> 01:23:13.075
You shot him
right through his eye.

01:23:13.077 --> 01:23:14.912
You think I'd forget that?

01:23:14.914 --> 01:23:17.282
You turned on me
more than once.

01:23:19.952 --> 01:23:21.284
In the end, I knew
it was my fault,

01:23:21.286 --> 01:23:23.122
but that doesn't change
what you did.

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:26.990
I had every right
to take his life

01:23:26.992 --> 01:23:28.561
after what he took from me.

01:23:31.664 --> 01:23:33.400
You mean what I took from you?

01:23:38.237 --> 01:23:40.636
When I got locked up in here,
I had to prove to the captains

01:23:40.638 --> 01:23:44.274
that I still had power on the
outside, so they would accept me,

01:23:44.276 --> 01:23:46.713
otherwise they were
gonna kill me, or worse.

01:23:47.746 --> 01:23:50.215
One of them had
an old beef with Manny, so...

01:23:51.951 --> 01:23:54.187
I asked Christian
to take him out.

01:23:56.522 --> 01:23:57.689
And for that...

01:23:58.890 --> 01:24:00.360
I earned my crown.

01:24:02.995 --> 01:24:06.732
He did it to save my life.
He was my brother.

01:24:08.267 --> 01:24:10.233
And it was almost perfect.

01:24:10.235 --> 01:24:12.438
No one would have
ever suspected it was him.

01:24:13.939 --> 01:24:15.806
But somehow...

01:24:15.808 --> 01:24:17.143
you knew.

01:24:21.479 --> 01:24:24.116
Clever of you
to give Joker my gun.

01:24:26.052 --> 01:24:27.487
Where did you guys hide it?

01:24:28.687 --> 01:24:30.421
My dad's garage.

01:24:30.423 --> 01:24:32.823
And you knew without the gun

01:24:32.825 --> 01:24:34.461
there wouldn't be any proof.

01:24:38.263 --> 01:24:39.631
But I didn't need it.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.668
You were there?

01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:47.340
He whispered it
with his dying breath.

01:24:50.375 --> 01:24:52.544
I would have never
believed it, either.

01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:57.250
- That we're like...
- Like brothers?

01:25:09.195 --> 01:25:10.697
Goodbye, Hugo.

01:25:12.031 --> 01:25:13.265
See you in Hell.

01:25:53.738 --> 01:25:54.741
Redding.

01:26:02.947 --> 01:26:04.183
What?

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:08.888
Thanks.

01:26:20.465 --> 01:26:22.869
Suddenly I'm engulfed in light.

01:26:24.603 --> 01:26:26.805
My skin peels off like a snake.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.610
My muscles float away.

01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:34.379
And all that's left is my bones.

01:26:36.749 --> 01:26:39.352
Vines covered in orange
and blue flowers...

01:26:40.652 --> 01:26:44.890
twist in spiral patterns across
my skull and through my ribs.

01:26:48.294 --> 01:26:50.729
My eyes are red roses.

01:26:52.098 --> 01:26:53.733
And I'm floating...

01:26:54.967 --> 01:26:57.503
seeing the reflection of myself.

01:26:58.836 --> 01:27:00.370
Then what happens?

01:27:00.372 --> 01:27:01.907
Nothing really.

01:27:03.174 --> 01:27:04.576
I just float...

01:27:05.844 --> 01:27:07.246
and then I wake up.

01:27:08.446 --> 01:27:10.346
What do you think it means?

01:27:10.348 --> 01:27:11.650
It's a reminder...

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:15.454
that when it happens,
there's nothing to fear.

01:27:16.487 --> 01:27:19.088
You can't stop what's coming.

01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:21.324
And for that instant,

01:27:21.326 --> 01:27:23.593
you're a soul...

01:27:23.595 --> 01:27:26.331
and you're finally free
to become one with God.

01:27:28.134 --> 01:27:29.902
I don't really believe in God.

01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:33.403
Call it whatever you want...

01:27:33.405 --> 01:27:35.275
but He's playing all around us.

01:27:37.509 --> 01:27:39.379
I have a dream sometimes, too.

01:27:42.113 --> 01:27:43.549
But it's different.

01:27:45.151 --> 01:27:46.816
In mine...

01:27:46.818 --> 01:27:49.554
my hands are covered
in this sticky black tar.

01:27:50.656 --> 01:27:52.189
Like Venom.

01:27:52.191 --> 01:27:54.559
The comic book character.

01:27:57.095 --> 01:28:00.062
- The alien from Spider-Man?
- Exactly.

01:28:00.064 --> 01:28:01.933
- Oh.
- Just like that.

01:28:03.102 --> 01:28:04.470
This black stuff...

01:28:05.571 --> 01:28:07.907
gets on everything I touch.

01:28:09.073 --> 01:28:10.576
All over my clothes...

01:28:11.643 --> 01:28:12.711
my skin...

01:28:17.249 --> 01:28:18.951
So I go find a sink, right?

01:28:20.184 --> 01:28:22.052
And I scrub,

01:28:22.054 --> 01:28:23.690
and lather up with soap...

01:28:26.224 --> 01:28:28.758
but it never comes clean.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.861
It's obvious.

01:28:30.862 --> 01:28:32.095
What?

01:28:32.097 --> 01:28:33.499
The blood in your hands.

01:28:34.532 --> 01:28:37.267
A man trying
to wash away his sins.

01:28:37.269 --> 01:28:38.571
Nah.

01:28:39.838 --> 01:28:41.538
That's a cop-out.

01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.108
Plus, I haven't
told you how it ends.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:45.478
So, after a while...

01:28:46.478 --> 01:28:48.414
I just stop trying
to wash it away.

01:28:49.348 --> 01:28:50.616
I don't give up.

01:28:51.482 --> 01:28:54.584
I just diffuse the power
it has over me

01:28:54.586 --> 01:28:58.023
by realizing there's nothing
I can do to change it.

01:28:59.924 --> 01:29:00.992
Once I do that...

01:29:03.362 --> 01:29:05.064
it disappears.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.935
So, actually, it's the opposite.

01:29:11.937 --> 01:29:16.472
By surrendering, I set myself
free from the guilt.

01:29:16.474 --> 01:29:18.941
Because I know
that carrying it around

01:29:18.943 --> 01:29:20.446
is my choice...

01:29:21.246 --> 01:29:23.682
and will infect
anything I touch.

01:29:29.254 --> 01:29:31.555
That's not what
the dream is about.

01:29:31.557 --> 01:29:34.024
Listen, Loca.

01:29:34.026 --> 01:29:38.130
I know someday my past is gonna
come knocking, just like yours did.

01:29:39.665 --> 01:29:42.164
I know everyone I hurt...

01:29:42.166 --> 01:29:43.535
was somebody's son...

01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:46.472
somebody's brother...

01:29:48.106 --> 01:29:49.474
father...

01:29:50.875 --> 01:29:52.010
best friend.

01:29:53.778 --> 01:29:55.580
But I'm comfortable with that.

01:29:56.816 --> 01:29:58.151
I have to be.

01:29:59.619 --> 01:30:03.589
Because it never happens
how or when you expect it to.

01:30:07.558 --> 01:30:09.161
I can live with the blackness...

01:30:10.262 --> 01:30:11.664
just look past it.

01:30:13.832 --> 01:30:15.535
That's why I'm still here.

01:30:16.535 --> 01:30:18.204
That's why I'm the boss.

01:30:19.271 --> 01:30:20.773
Now, when you look past it...

01:30:21.573 --> 01:30:23.239
what do you see?

01:30:23.241 --> 01:30:25.376
Simple.

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:29.816
I see this beautiful and
dangerous life we've been given.

01:32:17.356 --> 01:32:20.222
They say revenge is a pendulum,

01:32:20.224 --> 01:32:22.995
set in motion by those
who seek justice...

01:32:23.862 --> 01:32:26.395
its weight measured in grief,

01:32:26.397 --> 01:32:28.133
and force determined by blood.

01:32:29.567 --> 01:32:30.936
It never stops...

01:32:31.937 --> 01:32:34.874
until one day it lands on you...

01:32:35.808 --> 01:32:37.143
or someone you love...

01:32:38.009 --> 01:32:40.276
and then, you have
to make a choice.

01:32:58.097 --> 01:32:59.732
Bang.
