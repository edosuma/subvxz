30:31.247 --> 30:32.665
Uh, you know, I don't know...

30:32.749 --> 30:36.836
I'm doing school and maybe
the focus is on that and
getting a job and something

30:36.920 --> 30:39.047
and then doing something
with film, I don't know...

30:39.422 --> 30:42.342
Well, I hope you do,
because you love it

30:42.425 --> 30:44.052
and you're really
good at it, and...

30:44.761 --> 30:46.054
I always thought
you'd go to film school.

30:47.263 --> 30:51.643
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean I haven't even
really done anything...

30:52.101 --> 30:53.436
What are you talking about?

30:53.728 --> 30:56.356
Since you could hold
a camera in your hand,
you've been filming things

30:56.439 --> 30:58.441
and making people
laugh and cry.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.568
You're great.
You're really good at it.

31:02.570 --> 31:06.324
You are blessed in that
you have a passion
in your life, right?

31:06.407 --> 31:09.160
And when a person
has a passion,
they gotta jump on it.

31:09.244 --> 31:11.538
You gotta go with that
when you're young,
otherwise you get trapped,

31:11.621 --> 31:13.456
you know,
in something practical.

31:14.082 --> 31:15.083
- Right?
- Yeah.

31:15.917 --> 31:20.713
And I could have told you
all that if you had
ever asked my advice.

31:23.383 --> 31:25.885
If you had answered
my calls or my texts.

31:28.388 --> 31:31.432
It's just... Like I said,
I've been busy. You know?

31:31.808 --> 31:33.518
It's like a full load
trying to finish.

31:35.812 --> 31:37.772
- Are you mad at me?
- Mmm-mmm.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.567
- For sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:42.485 --> 31:44.404
Honey, you don't
have to study business

31:44.487 --> 31:46.948
just because it's what they
want you to do, all right?

31:47.615 --> 31:49.784
You're a very
talented filmmaker

31:50.118 --> 31:52.245
and that's what you should
be doing with your life.

31:52.745 --> 31:53.705
Mmm-hmm.

31:54.581 --> 31:55.665
You have a gift.

31:56.332 --> 32:00.670
And don't let people tell
you what you can and
can't do with your gift.

32:01.129 --> 32:02.088
Mmm-hmm.

32:02.630 --> 32:06.342
I want us to be closer,
Trey. I want us to have
a real relationship.

32:06.426 --> 32:08.553
- I do, too.
- Really?

32:08.636 --> 32:09.596
Uh-huh.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.223
Then why can't you
even look at me?

32:15.810 --> 32:19.105
Honey, I got my
shit together now

32:19.188 --> 32:22.692
and I'm going to
change my life so that
I can be closer to you.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.277
I'm gonna move to Austin.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.322
I'm gonna live wherever
you live and I'm gonna
let you live your life.

32:28.156 --> 32:31.743
But I just want to
be close to you and
make up for lost time.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.245
Don't you want that?

32:34.329 --> 32:36.247
(SIGHING)

32:37.123 --> 32:38.666
Why will you
not talk to me?

32:44.380 --> 32:46.883
Okay, I brought
this up too soon.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.927
We can talk about it
another time, all right?
My bad...

32:50.011 --> 32:52.430
Did you ever think
that maybe I like
business management?

32:52.513 --> 32:53.598
That that's
what I want to do?

32:57.060 --> 32:58.102
Totally sorry.

32:58.853 --> 33:00.980
Totally sorry.
Way too soon!

33:01.648 --> 33:02.857
Not cool.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.401
Don't be mad
at me, okay? Please.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.154
Baby, you...

33:10.073 --> 33:11.699
- Trey...
- I'm gonna go downstairs.

33:12.742 --> 33:13.701
Please.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.872
You know how much
I love you, right?

(KRISHA)
I fucked up. I got it. I fucked up.

01:07:28.587 --> 01:07:30.589
Krisha, I have no idea
what you're doing.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:34.301
- I really, don't even know what you're doing.
- I just told you

01:07:34.385 --> 01:07:35.678
that I was sorry, Robyn.

01:07:36.512 --> 01:07:38.639
I don't think "sorry"
really cuts it, Krisha.

01:07:40.683 --> 01:07:43.269
Do you know that every person
that I love is in that room,

01:07:44.353 --> 01:07:45.646
every one of them.

01:07:46.731 --> 01:07:50.609
(SOBBING)
And I thought you were...
I'm so shocked.

01:07:50.693 --> 01:07:53.654
I'm disappointed.
I really am.

01:07:55.531 --> 01:07:57.366
(GASPS)
Did you lie to me?

01:07:57.658 --> 01:07:58.784
No!

01:07:59.744 --> 01:08:01.370
I don't think you've
been sober, Krisha.

01:08:01.454 --> 01:08:04.081
- You told me you were sober.
- I have been sober, Robyn.

01:08:04.999 --> 01:08:06.125
How long?

01:08:08.669 --> 01:08:10.129
I didn't think you were
really sober.

01:08:11.505 --> 01:08:12.631
Oh, Krisha,

01:08:13.507 --> 01:08:16.343
I don't really know how you can
lie to me about something like this.

01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:18.429
This is so important.

01:08:18.763 --> 01:08:20.180
This was your chance.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:25.269
How do you lie to me?
This is Bobbie.

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:28.397
I've been taking care of you
your whole life.

01:08:30.316 --> 01:08:31.984
I don't know
how you could lie to me.

01:08:34.028 --> 01:08:36.863
(KRISHA MUMBLING)
I have to tell you this, Krisha.

01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:38.532
Trey did not
want you to come.

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:42.912
Because he was scared.
The whole family was scared.

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:45.663
But I defended you.

01:08:47.416 --> 01:08:50.669
I told everybody you did the work.
I told them.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:51.879
(GASPS)

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.714
I shouldn't have let you
back in my house.

01:08:53.798 --> 01:08:56.716
- I'm gonna be sick.
- I shouldn't... Right now?

01:08:56.801 --> 01:08:59.178
Okay, go in there.
There's a...
Go right there.

01:09:02.014 --> 01:09:04.015

I don't...

There's something
wrong with me.
Beyond the drinking.

and I looked at Trey

"You fucking blew this.
You blew it."

01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:49.163
You didn't blow
anything for good.

He's mad at you.

It doesn't mean he hates you.
There's a big difference.

01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:07.765
He's really just hurt.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.935
There's a lot you missed.

01:11:13.228 --> 01:11:15.522
That doesn't mean you can't
fix it with him with time.

01:11:16.857 --> 01:11:18.233
But you have to do the work.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.570
That's all there is to it.
You have to do it.

I was doing the work.

01:11:27.576 --> 01:11:29.703

I was like, okay, right?
I was, like, together.

01:11:38.963 --> 01:11:43.008
I was healthy. I was like...
And then I come
into the family...

Well, that can happen
to anybody, Krisha.

01:11:46.011 --> 01:11:47.680

- There's a lot of dynamics.

I'm the eggshell one.

01:11:50.391 --> 01:11:51.350
Yeah?

We all do love you.
