00:01.335 --> 00:03.128
Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons.

00:03.253 --> 00:06.673
A stunning development tonight
as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent.

00:06.757 --> 00:09.843
We have the identity of the real killer.
But first...

00:09.927 --> 00:13.639
It's fall. The time of year when the
leaves turn a pretty, purpley orange...

00:13.722 --> 00:16.683
...and Quahog prepares
for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.353
Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa
joins us live...

00:19.436 --> 00:22.439
...from the ceremony where
they are choosing this year's theme.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.943
Diane, behind me
are 1,000 beautiful doves.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.196
Gently tied to each of their delicate legs
is a parade theme...

00:29.279 --> 00:31.949
...suggested by
ordinary citizens of Quahog.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.368
And here to pick
this year's winning theme...

00:34.451 --> 00:36.870
...is Ten Commandments star,
Charlton Heston.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.081
Let my pigeons go!

00:39.498 --> 00:40.624
[Wings flapping]

00:41.458 --> 00:42.543
[Gun loading]

00:42.876 --> 00:45.170
He nailed one! We have our theme!

00:46.463 --> 00:49.550
I submitted "togetherness."
A simple theme.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.552
But powerful, nonetheless.

00:51.635 --> 00:55.556
Come on, "overcoming adversity"!
Let's go, "overcoming adversity"!

00:55.639 --> 00:58.016
Show me "women I gave the clap to"!

00:58.183 --> 01:01.270
And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is:

01:01.353 --> 01:03.814
"The episode of Who's the Boss?...

01:03.897 --> 01:06.775
"...where Tony sees Angela
naked in the shower."

01:06.859 --> 01:09.695
Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable!

01:09.778 --> 01:12.573
[Cheering]

01:12.656 --> 01:16.535
Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley
must be turning over in his grave.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.621
Wait a minute. He's not dead yet.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.707
"Michael Flatley."

01:21.957 --> 01:25.794
It's great they picked your theme,
but isn't it a little esoteric?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.337
Esoteric?

01:27.588 --> 01:29.965
-Could it mean "sexy"?
-I think it's a science term.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.509
Fellas, esoteric means "delicious."

01:33.135 --> 01:35.888
Who's the Boss? is not a food.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.389
BRIAN: Swing and a miss.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.976
LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

01:41.435 --> 01:44.605
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

01:44.730 --> 01:47.774
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

01:48.358 --> 01:50.527
"on which we used to rely?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.614
"Lucky there's a family guy

01:54.615 --> 01:57.951
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

01:58.035 --> 01:59.620
"all the things that make us

01:59.703 --> 02:01.288
"laugh 'n' cry

02:01.496 --> 02:05.501
"He's a family guy"

02:08.086 --> 02:11.423
I have no friends,
and it's all because of this stupid purse!

02:11.715 --> 02:15.385
What did you do to my daughter?
I swear to God, if you touched her...

02:16.386 --> 02:17.763
Honey, what happened?

02:18.680 --> 02:20.140
It was lunchtime and...

02:20.557 --> 02:22.851
I love the color of your Prada bag.

02:22.935 --> 02:26.730
-Yeah, but yours has that great clasp.
-Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch?

02:26.897 --> 02:30.984
You know what? There's no room
in my car for your big, ugly purse.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.153
[Girls laughing]

02:33.445 --> 02:35.781
Meg, let me tell you about popularity.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.283
GIRL #1: Mrs. Canner? Are you coming?
CANNER: Bye!

02:39.159 --> 02:42.162
Daddy, if you really loved me,
you'd buy me a Prada bag.

02:42.246 --> 02:45.415
I can't say no to you, honey.
What are they, like, $10?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.626
More like $1,100.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.086
[Laughing]

02:49.294 --> 02:51.588
You wish I loved you that much!

02:51.755 --> 02:52.756
[Sighs]

02:53.048 --> 02:55.634
We'll never finish the float
in time for the parade.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.135
Pick up the pace, guys!

02:57.219 --> 02:58.804
Peter, your theme is a dud.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.348
Yeah. I've never even seen
Who's the Boss?

03:01.431 --> 03:05.978
Tuesdays in the '80s I was always
in bed by 8:00 and home by 11:00.

03:06.562 --> 03:10.566
But I can't do it without you guys,
because I'll tell you who's the boss.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.484
It's not Tony or Angela.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.696
It's not even man-crazy Mona.
It's all of us.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.533
You're the boss because you never
give up, like with the ladies.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.076
Gemini.

03:21.577 --> 03:22.744
Capricorn.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.706
I know you're not a Virgo!

03:27.749 --> 03:30.127
From down here, you look like a Pisces!

03:30.836 --> 03:34.214
And Cleveland, you're the boss
because of your attention to detail.

03:34.298 --> 03:38.135
Like when we play pool,
you take so long to line up your shots...

03:38.218 --> 03:40.512
...I just want to crack you
with a cue stick.

03:40.596 --> 03:43.515
But I don't because that would be
a hate crime, and I love you.

03:43.599 --> 03:48.061
And Joe, I've had new neighbors before,
but none were half the man you are.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.981
Since you're half a man already,
that splits them...

03:51.064 --> 03:53.442
...into some kind of fraction
I can't even measure.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.737
He's right. If we work together,
we can win this thing. Who's in?

03:57.321 --> 03:59.031
Go, Spooner Street!

03:59.156 --> 04:02.242
[Heroic instrumental music]

04:03.994 --> 04:06.496
My dad always says,
"Measure twice, cut once."

04:06.580 --> 04:09.791
My daddy always said,
"Cleveland Jr., quit jumping on the bed!"

04:09.875 --> 04:11.335
[Laughing]

04:11.418 --> 04:13.086
We didn't measure!

04:13.879 --> 04:16.965
BRIAN: Amazing. The whole
neighborhood is working together.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.759
You know what's really amazing?

04:18.842 --> 04:23.096
I haven't brushed my teeth in three days,
and no one has said a thing.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.520
If I had a job,
I could buy the bag myself.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.899
I have squandered my munitions budget
on that insipid Rugrats video!

04:33.982 --> 04:35.817
Perhaps I should seek employment.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.862
Mother teaches piano.
I suppose I could as well.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.114
All right, try it again, Richard.

04:41.198 --> 04:44.159
And remember,
the wrong keys are electrified.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.246
[Electric shock]

04:47.329 --> 04:49.081
I don't want to play the piano!

04:49.164 --> 04:51.708
Indeed.
Would you rather play the bassoon?

04:51.917 --> 04:53.335
[Playing bassoon]

04:53.544 --> 04:54.545
[Screams]

04:54.962 --> 04:56.880
No experience? No, thanks.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.006
[Sighs]

04:58.090 --> 04:59.299
[Whispering]

04:59.383 --> 05:01.510
Oh, nuts. Young lady.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.595
What's the little guy's name?

05:03.679 --> 05:04.680
What do you care?

05:04.763 --> 05:08.976
I can't send an unwed teenage mother
out on the street without a job.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.436
Stewie. My son's name is Stewie.

05:12.855 --> 05:16.650
DIANE: Welcome to the 83rd annual
Quahog Harvest Festival Parade.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.694
Are you as excited as I am, Tom?

05:18.777 --> 05:20.737
Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood...

05:20.821 --> 05:24.116
...and clipped onto it
is a list of this year's float entries.

05:24.199 --> 05:27.411
Remember, the float that best captures
this year's theme...

05:27.494 --> 05:29.788
...wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.373
And here's our first float.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.543
DIANE: It looks like some wires
got crossed on Clover Street.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.504
That's not Angela.
That's Mona, Angela's mom.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.382
TOM: Wonderful use of tree bark
for the age spots though.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.844
This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan.
That's just plain wrong.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.014
Each float possesses its own
unique charm. But none of them--

05:47.097 --> 05:49.099
Oh, baby! Look at that!

05:50.934 --> 05:52.853
The float turned out great.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.940
Our neighborhood hasn't been this united
since Quagmire got us free cable.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.113
CLEVELAND: We are not bad people.

06:03.197 --> 06:06.783
We just don't want to pay $12 a month
for Cinemax.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.288
First place goes to Spooner Street.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.415
[Cheering]

06:13.498 --> 06:15.501
RESIDENTS: We won! All right!

06:21.465 --> 06:23.634
[Uncomfortable laughter]

06:28.972 --> 06:30.891
Come on now! This is damn foolish!

06:30.974 --> 06:32.684
My theme, my trophy!

06:32.768 --> 06:35.729
My aunt Fanny!
You said it yourself! I'm the boss!

06:35.812 --> 06:40.192
He said I, too, was the boss.
And it's time Cleveland got his due.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.569
BONNIE: Joe, my feet are
starting to swell.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.405
You two go home.
I can stay here as long as it takes.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.408
You'd be amazed how little one eats
when your legs don't work.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.452
There's only one way to settle this.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.037
Russian Roulette.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.332
Three bullets, last guy standing
keeps the trophy. Me first.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.126
No. Wait a minute, this is crazy.

06:58.669 --> 06:59.837
You first.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.298
There's gotta be a way for you all
to enjoy the trophy.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.511
Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it.
There it is again!

07:07.886 --> 07:10.013
LOIS: Perfect, Peter.
Now we can all enjoy it.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.474
[Muttering approval]

07:12.558 --> 07:14.476
Here's to togetherness!

07:16.186 --> 07:17.229
Car!

07:17.980 --> 07:19.481
[Car approaching]

07:20.858 --> 07:22.359
Meg, order up!

07:22.484 --> 07:25.195
Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.615
I don't care if they're
from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!

07:28.699 --> 07:30.409
Try them. You'll like them.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.786
Yes, well, I rather doubt that.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.748
Yes! These are delectable.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.544
Flappy, good news!
I've decided not to kill you!

07:43.088 --> 07:45.174
What a precious little boy.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.967
That's my son.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.887
Your son? But you're just a baby yourself.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.723
Henry, give the little skank a nice tip.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.434
$20!

07:56.476 --> 07:57.769
Welcome to Flappy's.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.771
Why don't you sit next to my baby...

07:59.855 --> 08:02.024
...whose deadbeat dad
doesn't pay child support.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.108
[Belching]

08:09.615 --> 08:11.283
[Horrified scream]

08:11.408 --> 08:13.035
[Dramatic instrumental music]

08:13.118 --> 08:14.494
Peter, what is it?

08:14.578 --> 08:16.163
CLEVELAND: What's going on out here?

08:16.246 --> 08:18.165
Clear the way! I'm a cop!

08:18.248 --> 08:21.627
Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on.
I'm so sorry.

08:21.793 --> 08:25.380
That's okay, son.
It's your right as an American citizen.

08:25.881 --> 08:26.882
[Screaming]

08:26.965 --> 08:30.969
QUAGMIRE: What's all the noise?
I was just jerked out of a sound sleep.

08:31.053 --> 08:35.641
Perhaps someone could enlighten me as
to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?

08:35.724 --> 08:38.685
-Maybe it fell.
-Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.562
You think one of us stole it?

08:40.646 --> 08:44.525
I never said the word "stole." Looks like
someone has a guilty conscience.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.068
Guilty conscience!

08:46.276 --> 08:49.363
I'm the only guy on this block
who actually pays for his cable.

08:49.905 --> 08:54.409
Pretty high and mighty for a man who
left our nation's flag out in the rain...

08:54.493 --> 08:58.455
...last Fourth of July.
That's against the law, Officer!

08:58.539 --> 08:59.623
[Gasping]

08:59.706 --> 09:00.832
You're one to talk.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.502
Out there every trash day
picking through my garbage.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.045
That's an invasion of my privacy.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.129
[Gasping]

09:06.255 --> 09:09.216
He's sorting your recycling
because he loves our Mother Earth.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.052
If you weren't so busy
trolling for booty all the time...

09:12.135 --> 09:15.055
...you could do it yourself,
like the law says you should.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.139
[Gasping]

09:16.223 --> 09:17.224
PETER: It's on now!

09:17.307 --> 09:19.059
JOE: Wait a second! What about Peter?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.228
He's the one
who wanted the trophy all along!

09:21.311 --> 09:22.521
I couldn't have stolen it.

09:22.604 --> 09:26.358
Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder
so I could steal the trophy tonight.

09:26.441 --> 09:30.445
What? It's a ladder. He can't use it.
It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.

09:30.529 --> 09:34.408
Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe.
Real oddballs.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.868
I don't trust them.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.579
LOIS: I saw them taking coupons
out of our mailbox.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.497
QUAGMIRE: I don't like the look of her!

09:40.789 --> 09:42.249
I offer you a recipe.

09:42.332 --> 09:46.086
Combine one small-town neighborhood
with a dash of missing trophy...

09:46.170 --> 09:49.339
...and what you're left with is a gumbo
fit only for a madman.

09:49.464 --> 09:52.050
A gumbo served almost exclusively in The--

09:52.134 --> 09:54.386
PETER: Who the hell is that?
I bet he took it!

09:54.469 --> 09:57.181
JOE: Where are you going, Serling?
Want some of this?

09:57.306 --> 09:58.640
QUAGMIRE: Come back here!

10:02.477 --> 10:03.937
I'm off to work.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.105
PETER: Okay, honey.

10:05.189 --> 10:08.358
One of our neighbors took that trophy,
and I'll find out who.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.737
-I'm taking Stewie with me again.
-Fine, sweetie.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.780
This whole thing just makes me sick!

10:13.864 --> 10:16.992
-We played Pictionary with them!
-Bastards!

10:17.075 --> 10:20.621
Giddy-up, you stubby little mare!
To the pancake house!

10:21.705 --> 10:23.081
Well, bye.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.751
And to think
they used to be our best friends!

10:25.834 --> 10:27.753
That was then and this is now!

10:27.836 --> 10:31.840
And this is a chair. That's a lamp.
You have boobies. I'll find that trophy!

10:32.883 --> 10:36.553
JOE: To be honest, Peter, we were all
a little surprised you invited us over.

10:36.637 --> 10:40.891
We realized our friendship is a lot
more important than some stupid trophy.

10:40.974 --> 10:41.975
[Kettle whistling]

21:43.387 --> 21:47.683
A family pet with the uncontrollable urge
to bury shiny objects in the yard.

21:47.808 --> 21:49.643
A shameful secret that nearly buried the

21:49.726 --> 21:51.895
peace and civility
of an entire neighbor...

21:58.151 --> 22:01.029
Stewie seems a little feverish
after his ordeal.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.407
And he keeps asking for pancakes.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.492
Let's just let him rest.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.871
Flappy, what have you done to me?

22:08.954 --> 22:10.372
It's so hot.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.082
Now I'm freezing!

22:12.165 --> 22:15.335
What I wouldn't do
for one syrup-soaked bite.

22:19.548 --> 22:20.841
[Screams]
