WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.576
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.676 --> 00:10.378
WELL,
DAVID WAS MY FIRST.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.713
DON'T LOOK
AT ME LIKE THAT.
I WASN'T A VICTIM.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.115
I GOT INTO HIS BED.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.384
HE WAS A 40-YEAR-OLD MAN,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.252
YOUR FATHER HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS GOING ON?

00:18.352 --> 00:20.654
HE WAS ASLEEP
IN THE NEXT ROOM.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.456
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:22.556 --> 00:26.294
THAT YOU TALK
TO YOUR FATHER
ABOUT THIS

00:26.394 --> 00:27.795
WHILE IT'S STILL
POSSIBLE.

00:27.895 --> 00:31.532
YOU KNOW THAT THIS THING
WITH ME AND ALEX IS OVER.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.702
I ENDED IT.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.471
I CAN'T CONTINUE, PAUL.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.807
EVERY MINUTE HERE
IS TEARING ME APART.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.586
- ( shower running )
- DADDY?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.328
( theme music playing )

01:57.385 --> 01:59.587
( cell phone ringing )

02:02.156 --> 02:05.193
YES, HELLO.

02:05.293 --> 02:08.196
NO, I'M ON MY WAY
SOMEWHERE.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.130
NO, NOT TO THE WARD.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.435
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.437
BECAUSE HIS TEMPERATURE
IS SLIGHTLY UP,

02:16.537 --> 02:19.407
AND I DON'T WANT IT
TO GET OUT OF HAND.

02:19.507 --> 02:22.142
JUST TELL THEM
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM
UNTIL I GET THERE.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.412
JUST KEEP AN EYE
ON HIS FEVER.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.448
IN ABOUT 90 MINUTES.

02:28.916 --> 02:32.420
LOOK, IT'S-- IT'S IMPORTANT.
CAN I COUNT ON YOU?

02:33.687 --> 02:36.557
OKAY. OKAY, BYE.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.893
- HI.
- HI.

02:41.128 --> 02:44.665
- HERE, FOR YOU.
- OH. WHAT IS IT?

02:44.765 --> 02:48.836
THERE'S A FARMER'S MARKET
ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.405
MAPLE SYRUP.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.407
- IT'S VERMONT'S FINEST.
- THANKS.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.577
SURE. YOUR KIDS
EAT PANCAKES, RIGHT?

02:57.478 --> 02:58.846
YEAH.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.886
COME ON IN.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.356
THANKS.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.495
THANKS FOR SEEING ME.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.264
WHEN I WAS DIALING
YOUR NUMBER THIS MORNING,

03:16.364 --> 03:17.565
I THOUGHT, "SHIT,
IT'S NOT EVEN 8:00.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.400
I PROBABLY WOKE
EVERYONE UP."

03:19.500 --> 03:22.670
PLEASE, THIS PLACE IS
A CIRCUS BY 8:00.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.974
I HAD NO ONE ELSE
TO TALK TO.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.909
I EVEN
CALLED ANDREW,

03:29.009 --> 03:32.280
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE NEVER CALLED ME BACK.
ANYWAY, THANKS.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.986
I THOUGHT MY HOUR WOULD
BE FILLED ALREADY.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.322
YOUR HOUR ISN'T FILLED.
HOW IS YOUR DAD?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.424
IS HE STILL IN I.C.U.?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.793
YES.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.229
HIS TEMPERATURE WENT UP
AND THEY WANTED TO MOVE
HIM TO THE WARD,

03:49.330 --> 03:52.766
BUT I WANT HIM KEPT THERE
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE,

03:52.866 --> 03:55.303
YOU KNOW, WHERE HE'S GOT
ONE-ON-ONE NURSING CARE.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.212
HE LOOKS SO SMALL,
YOU KNOW.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.815
SO TINY.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.650
( sighs )

04:09.750 --> 04:12.653
HE LOOKS LOST
IN THAT HUGE BED.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.659
YOU CAN BARELY SEE
HIS BODY UNDER THE SHEETS.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.333
HE LOOKS LIKE E.T.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.272
YOU'D THINK I'D BE
MORE RESISTANT, HUH?

04:32.373 --> 04:35.909
I'VE ALREADY
SEEN PEOPLE SHRINK
INTO LITTLE GREMLINS.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.782
BUT NOT MY FATHER.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.225
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.961
I TOLD HIM
ABOUT DAVID.

04:54.061 --> 04:57.498
WHEN I LEFT HERE
LAST WEEK, I CALLED
HIM ON THE WAY HOME.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.901
HE WAS SO HAPPY
TO HEAR FROM ME.

05:01.001 --> 05:04.605
IT HAD BEEN A MONTH
SINCE WE'D SEEN EACH OTHER,

05:04.705 --> 05:08.141
SO I WENT AROUND TO HIS HOUSE
AND HE ORDERED TAKEOUT.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.210
MY DAD NEVER
ORDERS TAKEOUT.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.812
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW.

05:11.912 --> 05:15.816
I SWEAR,
HE ORDERED HALF THE MENU.
I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.089
HE MEANS WELL,
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE KNOWS WHAT I LIKE.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.394
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR KIDS LIKE?

05:26.494 --> 05:30.330
YOU MEAN APART
FROM PANCAKES?

05:31.999 --> 05:35.035
WHEN I TOLD HIM
ABOUT DAVID HE SAID...

05:38.105 --> 05:40.007
"I THOUGHT SO."

05:40.107 --> 05:43.877
WE WERE SITTING
IN THE KITCHEN SURROUNDED
BY TAKEOUT CONTAINERS,

05:43.977 --> 05:45.879
ABOUT 20 OF THEM.

05:45.979 --> 05:49.583
HE WAS JUST PUSHING
HIS EGG ROLL FROM ONE SIDE
OF THE PLATE TO THE OTHER,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.619
DIPPING IT
IN THE HOT MUSTARD
WITHOUT LOOKING UP AT ME

05:51.719 --> 05:53.787
AND SAYS,
"I THOUGHT SO."

05:54.888 --> 05:56.490
HMM.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.766
- DID YOU TELL HIM
THE FULL STORY?
- YEAH, WELL,

06:05.866 --> 06:09.570
MORE OR LESS.
I TOLD HIM THAT I SLEPT
WITH DAVID AT OUR HOUSE.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.439
HE ASKED ME
IF IT CONTINUED LATER,

06:11.539 --> 06:16.444
AND I SAID, "NO, IT WAS
JUST A PASSING THING."

06:16.544 --> 06:19.179
THAT NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME,
HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY,

06:19.279 --> 06:21.248
THAT IT CAME UP
IN THERAPY

06:21.348 --> 06:23.651
AND I THOUGHT I SHOULD TALK
TO HIM ABOUT IT.

06:23.751 --> 06:27.888
IT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME
LIKE YOUR FATHER WAS--

06:27.988 --> 06:30.090
DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE HE WAS SURPRISED.

06:32.359 --> 06:35.128
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

06:35.228 --> 06:38.365
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE
KNOWN ALL ALONG,

06:38.466 --> 06:40.768
AND THAT HE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

06:41.802 --> 06:45.005
I DIDN'T TAKE IT
THAT WAY.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.575
LOOK, PAUL, THE PAIN,
YOU KNOW, THE SHOCK
OF IT WAS SO BAD,

06:47.675 --> 06:51.411
HE IMMEDIATELY
HAD TO ACT AS IF
HE'D KNOWN ALL ALONG,

06:51.512 --> 06:54.548
AS IF TO DEFLECT
THE SHOCK OF IT TO...

06:57.150 --> 06:59.520
OLD HABITS
DIE HARD, HUH?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.221
YOU CAN TAKE
THE GIRL OUT OF THERAPY,

07:01.321 --> 07:04.091
BUT YOU CAN'T
TAKE THE THERAPY OUT
OF THE CONVERSATION.

07:18.405 --> 07:21.742
IT'S FUNNY.
THINGS FEEL DIFFERENT.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.145
FEELS LIKE I HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE FOR A YEAR.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.588
ARE THOSE NEW SHOES?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.524
THESE? NO, I FOUND THEM
IN THE CLOSET.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.960
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THEM.
I USED TO WEAR THEM BEFORE--

07:40.060 --> 07:42.429
- BEFORE I WAS MARRIED.
- THEY'RE NICE.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.898
THINK SO?

07:53.406 --> 07:55.743
I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU CALLED.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.111
REALLY?

07:59.212 --> 08:01.481
WHAT,
DID YOU MISS ME?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.719
YES, I DID.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.991
EVEN AFTER THAT
DRAMATIC EXIT LAST WEEK?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.860
YEAH.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.963
REALLY?

08:16.063 --> 08:18.331
YEAH.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.468
I GUESS
THE PROSPECT OF--

08:21.569 --> 08:24.271
OF NOT SEEING YOU
AGAIN KIND OF--

08:24.371 --> 08:26.740
KIND OF SCARED ME.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.044
LOSING A PATIENT
IS SUCH A BIG DEAL?

08:33.647 --> 08:35.949
LOSING YOU
IS A BIG DEAL.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.258
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT I SAID THAT?

08:45.358 --> 08:48.596
NO, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SAYING IT.
I MEAN, WHY NOW?

08:51.565 --> 08:53.366
IS THIS A TRICK?

08:53.466 --> 08:55.569
WHY WOULD I BE
TRICKING YOU?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.537
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SAYING IT.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.608
TO BE HONEST...
I DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE YOU.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.777
IT'S THE TRUTH,
LAURA.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.379
I'M TRYING TO SAY
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.015
I THINK
YOU DESERVE TO KNOW.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.417
I THINK IT'S--

09:10.517 --> 09:12.519
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO KNOW.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.988
KNOW WHAT?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.891
THAT I HAVE VERY
DEEP FEELINGS FOR YOU.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.929
I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.632
I REALLY MISS
YOU SOMETIMES. IT'S...

09:25.699 --> 09:28.769
NO, NOT SOMETIMES--

09:30.403 --> 09:31.438
OFTEN.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.307
I MISS YOU OFTEN.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.562
OKAY, SO WHAT NOW?

09:55.663 --> 09:58.899
I MEAN, IF I SAY YES,
THEN WHAT, IT WILL HAPPEN?

09:58.999 --> 10:02.435
WHAT, THIS ISN'T
THERAPY, SO IT'S OKAY
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

10:02.535 --> 10:05.472
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS WHOLE THING
DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.809
- IT FEELS WEIRD.
- WHAT, THAT I--

10:08.909 --> 10:10.944
THAT I SAID THAT
I HAD FEELINGS FOR YOU?

10:11.044 --> 10:13.446
YOU'RE TESTING ME.
ARE YOU TESTING ME, PAUL?

10:13.546 --> 10:14.848
NO.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.030
OKAY.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.135
OKAY, GOOD.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.415
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER SAT
ON THE SAME COUCH BEFORE.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.720
SO WHAT NOW?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.222
I DON'T KNOW, PAUL.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.325
( sighs )

11:00.127 --> 11:01.829
CAN I...

11:07.701 --> 11:10.203
LISTEN TO US.
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE LIKE THIS.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.039
EVERYTHING'S
SO POLITE.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.207
I MEAN, WITH ANDREW,
TWO HOURS AFTER I MET HIM,

11:14.307 --> 11:17.110
I WAS IN HIS BED.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.479
LUCKY IT WAS DARK.
IF I'D SEEN THE CONDITION
OF HIS APARTMENT,

11:19.579 --> 11:22.249
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
HAVE SLEPT WITH HIM.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.084
NO, ACTUALLY,
I WOULD HAVE,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.887
'CAUSE THAT'S
HOW IT IS WITH ME.
I ACT ON IMPULSE.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.222
DO YOU THINK THIS IS
ACTING ON IMPULSE?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.658
THIS ISN'T IMPULSIVE.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.461
THIS IS THE LONGEST FOREPLAY
I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.

11:34.561 --> 11:38.265
A YEAR OF JUST GETTING
TO KNOW YOU.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.839
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ME, LAURA?

11:48.876 --> 11:51.111
SPECIFICS, YOU MEAN?

11:54.414 --> 11:56.784
I KNOW SOME THINGS.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.485
I KNOW
YOU HAVE CHILDREN.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.020
YES, I DO.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.722
MAX, ROSIE, IAN.
YEAH, AND WHAT ELSE?

12:14.201 --> 12:17.070
ONCE OR TWICE
YOU HAVEN'T WORN
YOUR WEDDING RING.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.173
I NOTICED THAT.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.679
IT'S BECAUSE...

12:26.780 --> 12:29.850
SOMETIMES WHEN I'M WASHING
THE DISHES, THE...

12:32.752 --> 12:35.288
THE DISH SOAP
GETS UNDER THE BAND

12:36.356 --> 12:38.358
AND IRRITATES THE SKIN.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.567
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT NOW?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.837
JUST YOU.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.020
I REMEMBER ONCE
WHEN I WAS--

13:07.120 --> 13:09.622
( clears throat )
I WAS ABOUT 14,

13:09.722 --> 13:12.625
I HAD A CRUSH--

13:12.725 --> 13:14.828
NO, ACTUALLY,
I DIDN'T HAVE A CRUSH.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.464
I FELL IN LOVE WITH...

13:18.966 --> 13:21.268
MY BIOLOGY TEACHER.

13:21.368 --> 13:25.172
- OH, YEAH? WELL...
- SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
ABOUT 33, 34.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.676
I USED TO WRITE HER
THESE BIG LONG POEMS,

13:29.776 --> 13:32.579
AND I WOULD PUT THEM IN
WITH MY HOMEWORK.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.049
AND I REMEMBER

13:36.149 --> 13:39.752
SAYING TO HER ONE DAY,
"I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN GIRLS MY AGE.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.588
THEY DON'T GET ME.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ME.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.456
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHO THE REAL ME IS."

13:43.556 --> 13:47.194
WHAT I REALLY
WANTED WAS--

13:47.294 --> 13:49.796
WAS HER.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.900
SO ONE DAY,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.903
I FOUND MYSELF ALONE
IN THE LAB--

13:56.003 --> 13:58.738
IN THE SCIENCE LAB--
WITH HER.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.475
AND I HEARD
MYSELF SAY THAT--

14:04.611 --> 14:06.713
THAT I JUST HAD
TO KISS HER.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.016
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

14:11.584 --> 14:14.721
SHE TURNED OFF
THE LIGHTS,

14:14.821 --> 14:17.757
SHE CAME
RIGHT UP TO ME

14:17.857 --> 14:20.293
AND SHE STOOD FACING ME
IN COMPLETE DARKNESS.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.462
AND I REMEMBER

14:22.562 --> 14:24.731
THE SOUND
OF HER BREATHING

14:24.831 --> 14:28.368
AND THE SMELL
OF HER PERFUME.

14:28.468 --> 14:32.372
IT WAS LIKE I WAS
DRUNK OR SOMETHING.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.207
SHE LOOKED ME STRAIGHT
IN THE EYE,

14:34.307 --> 14:36.977
AND SHE SAID
REALLY QUIETLY...

14:38.478 --> 14:41.148
"GO ON. DO IT.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.317
JUST DO IT."

14:46.253 --> 14:49.156
- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHAT?

14:49.256 --> 14:51.925
I GOT THE HELL OUT
OF THERE, RAN AWAY.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.464
DID YOU EVER THINK
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
IF YOU HADN'T RUN?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.399
IF YOU HAD KISSED HER?

14:59.499 --> 15:02.235
I USED THINK ABOUT THAT
ALL THE TIME.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.838
BUT NOW WHEN
I THINK OF IT,

15:05.939 --> 15:08.208
I THANK HER FOR IT.
I DO.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.143
FOR WHAT?
FOR SCARING YOU?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.812
NO.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.515
I GUESS SHE SHOWED ME
THAT WHAT I FELT

15:15.615 --> 15:16.916
OR WHAT I THOUGHT I FELT,

15:17.017 --> 15:20.553
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS REAL
AND GENUINE TO ME, WAS--

15:20.653 --> 15:23.656
WAS REALLY
JUST A FANTASY.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.326
IT WASN'T REAL,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.361
AND THAT SHE HAD
THE COMPASSION

15:28.461 --> 15:32.065
TO LET ME GO BACK
TO MY FUTURE.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.379
DAVID DIDN'T
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.089
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO LOOK AT ME...

15:57.957 --> 16:00.660
THAT MY BODY WAS AMAZING,
THAT I WAS BEAUTIFUL.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.130
HE WENT ON AND ON
ABOUT THAT.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.736
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW NAIVE I WAS.

16:09.836 --> 16:13.240
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GONNA
HAPPEN WHEN I WALKED
INTO HIS ROOM, I--

16:14.941 --> 16:17.944
GOD, ISN'T IT CRAZY
ALL THE THINGS YOU
IMAGINE SEX WILL BE

16:18.045 --> 16:19.912
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG?

16:20.013 --> 16:22.482
I HAD VERY
ROMANTIC THOUGHTS.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.386
I IMAGINED
AN ANGEL WOULD COME,

16:26.486 --> 16:29.789
AND WHEN WE WERE IN BED,
SHE'D TOUCH ME...

16:29.889 --> 16:32.459
AND ERASE
MY FORMER LIFE.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.802
HE TOLD ME HOW PROUD
HE WAS OF ME.

16:42.902 --> 16:46.005
WHEN I WAS
IN CALIFORNIA, HE TOLD ME
I WAS RIPE FOR THIS,

16:46.106 --> 16:48.908
THAT I WAS A WOMAN.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.677
HE SAID
THAT I WAS READY.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.083
THEN HE STARTED
WHISPERING TO ME.

16:56.183 --> 16:59.252
HE SAID HE NEVER
HAD SUCH A HARD-ON
IN HIS LIFE.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.521
AND HE SAID,
"SEE WHAT YOU DID TO ME?"

17:02.789 --> 17:05.525
AND HE UNDRESSED

17:05.625 --> 17:09.096
AND STOOD IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROOM, SHOWING ME
WHAT I DID TO HIM.

17:09.196 --> 17:12.132
THEN HE UNDRESSED ME,

17:12.232 --> 17:14.401
AND HE WAS
VERY PROFESSIONAL.

17:20.073 --> 17:23.110
I REMEMBER HE SPIT...

17:24.677 --> 17:26.546
INTO HIS HAND

17:26.646 --> 17:29.048
IN ORDER TO WET HIS--

17:29.149 --> 17:31.284
IT WAS DISGUSTING.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.823
I THINK THAT WAS THE MINUTE
THAT I WANTED TO RUN AWAY,

17:36.923 --> 17:40.160
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE,
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT
I WAS READY.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.297
LISTEN TO ME, LAURA.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.267
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

17:47.367 --> 17:49.702
THAT NONE OF THIS
WAS YOUR FAULT.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.272
YOU WERE
16 YEARS OF AGE.

17:52.372 --> 17:55.842
YOU DIDN'T--
HOW COULD YOU HAVE KNOWN
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

17:55.942 --> 17:58.111
HOW COULD YOU KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT?

17:58.211 --> 18:00.480
I WANTED HIM
TO HOLD ME, PAUL.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.582
TO TAKE ME AWAY
FROM THE HOUSE,

18:02.682 --> 18:04.851
TO TAKE ME AWAY
FROM THE DEATH
OF THAT HOUSE.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.786
I JUST WANTED HIM
TO HELP ME GET AWAY.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.757
I NEVER WANTED HIM
TO FUCK ME.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.160
OH, LAURA.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.865
( sobbing )

18:35.081 --> 18:36.949
- FUCK, I RUINED IT.
- NO.

18:37.049 --> 18:40.019
- YOU DON'T WANT ME ANYMORE.
- NO, IT'S NOT TRUE, LAURA.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.021
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.024
I REALLY CARE
ABOUT YOU.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.527
I REALLY CARE ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.234
I WILL NOT DO ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD TO HURT YOU.
I PROMISE.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.069
LOOK, I THINK
THE REAL DAMAGE
THAT DAVID DID

18:57.170 --> 19:00.707
WAS THAT
HE DESTROYED YOUR ABILITY
TO COMMUNICATE WITH MEN

19:00.807 --> 19:02.909
- FROM A NON-SEXUAL PLACE.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.445
- YES, I THINK IT IS TRUE.
- YOU MAKE ME SOUND LIKE
I'M SO TERRIBLE, PAUL.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.680
THERE IS NOTHING TERRIBLE
ABOUT YOU TO ME, LAURA.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.616
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU DON'T WANNA
FUCK ME, DON'T FUCK ME.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.319
I'M A BIG GIRL.
I CAN TAKE IT.
GO ON, SAY IT TO MY FACE.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.322
- GO ON.
- LAURA, LISTEN TO ME.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.724
I THINK YOU FEEL THAT
IF I DON'T SLEEP WITH YOU,

19:17.824 --> 19:21.961
I'M NOT GONNA BE
INTERESTED IN YOU,
IN WHO YOU ARE.

19:22.061 --> 19:25.131
BUT I AM NOT WILLING
TO BETRAY YOU.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.367
I AM NOT GOING TO
DISAPPOINT YOU.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.669
I WILL NOT BE
ANOTHER DAVID.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.439
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN US, PAUL.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.907
SOMETHING MORE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.210
YOU'RE JUST TOO
FUCKING AFRAID.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.280
( cell phone ringing )

19:40.380 --> 19:42.081
IT'S MY BROTHER.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.717
HI, OLLIE.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.655
GREAT.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.523
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TELL THEM NOT TO MOVE
HIM TILL I GET THERE.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.158
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
OKAY?

19:52.259 --> 19:54.494
OKAY, BYE.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.697
WELL, HIS TEMPERATURE'S
NORMAL.

19:57.797 --> 20:01.401
GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.141
IT'LL BE OKAY,

20:09.242 --> 20:11.378
I PROMISE YOU.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.724
IT'LL BE OKAY.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.628
OKAY.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.920
( clanking )

21:11.838 --> 21:13.272
HI.

21:39.265 --> 21:41.734
( theme music playing )
