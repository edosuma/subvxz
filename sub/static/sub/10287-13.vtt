Yes. sir. It will be a pleasure
having you rule against me.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.390
Kind of a grumpy feller, ain't he?

11:48.569 --> 11:52.159
Well. I'm gonna insist that he come back
and have some fun with us.

11:52.339 --> 11:54.899
No. leave him alone.

11:55.075 --> 11:57.235
Well. I'll go by
his office in the morning...

11:57.410 --> 12:00.140
...and I'm gonna take him
a great big piece of--

12:00.313 --> 12:03.113
No. don't take anybody
a great big piece of whatever it is...

12:03.282 --> 12:07.192
...you two have slain
and dragged across the state line.

12:07.353 --> 12:10.693
Sounds like you've gotta burn
your bridges. Danny boy.

12:10.857 --> 12:12.757
Don't call me Danny boy.

12:12.925 --> 12:16.875
As a matter of fact. don't either of you
ever call me again. period.

12:24.237 --> 12:26.257
Pass me his roll.

12:37.782 --> 12:40.412
No sign of Dan in his office. sir.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.815
He's ten minutes late
for the session as it is.

12:42.988 --> 12:46.518
I asked around. but nobody's seen
the Elmores come back here.

12:46.691 --> 12:50.291
Can you blame them? I mean. the way
their own child walked out on them?

12:51.029 --> 12:53.619
The prodigal son returns.

13:05.676 --> 13:06.966
I'm sorry I'm late.

13:07.143 --> 13:08.913
I hope it was because a dog bit you...

13:09.078 --> 13:12.068
...and you had to go through
a series of painful rabies shots.

13:13.249 --> 13:14.939
Thank you.

13:22.425 --> 13:24.115
I know what you're thinking.

13:24.294 --> 13:27.204
I'm an ingrate son who ought not
to have treated his parents...

13:27.363 --> 13:28.833
...in such a dastardly fashion.

13:28.998 --> 13:31.428
-That's it. that's it.
-Took the words right out....

13:32.869 --> 13:36.239
Dan. I've gotta admit.
I'm disappointed in you myself.

13:36.406 --> 13:38.306
You didn't have to be raised
by them. sir.

13:38.474 --> 13:40.314
They seem like sweet. wonderful people.

13:40.476 --> 13:41.766
Good Lord. woman. are you blind?

13:41.944 --> 13:43.844
You probably came
from some normal family.

13:44.012 --> 13:45.982
I was raised
by the folks from Deliverance.

13:46.148 --> 13:47.738
We're talking....

13:48.149 --> 13:50.119
We are talking about your parents.

13:50.284 --> 13:53.584
We are talking about Ma and Pa Kettle.

13:54.255 --> 13:58.485
Dan. now. I know I can't force you
to talk about your personal relationships.

13:58.659 --> 14:00.719
But you'll make my life hell if I don't.

14:01.062 --> 14:04.052
Don't worry about it.
I'd threaten people too if I had the clout.

14:04.232 --> 14:06.222
I'll see you in my office. counselor.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.920
Yes. sir.

14:11.404 --> 14:14.904
I'd rather be raked over the coals alone.
if you don't mind.

14:49.609 --> 14:51.909
Want me to go cut you a switch?

14:52.077 --> 14:54.667
If it were in my jurisdiction.

14:54.846 --> 14:57.746
There's more here than just appears
on the surface. Harry.

14:57.915 --> 14:59.245
There usually is. Dan.

14:59.417 --> 15:03.107
Those people represent everything I have
fought to get away from my entire life.

15:03.287 --> 15:05.187
Dan. they can't be that bad.

15:05.722 --> 15:08.892
My God. Harry. they're Democrats.

15:11.662 --> 15:13.252
I stand corrected.

15:13.429 --> 15:14.859
My father is a dirt farmer.

15:15.031 --> 15:16.561
Dan. farming is noble--

15:16.731 --> 15:19.721
No crops. Harry. He farms dirt.

15:20.535 --> 15:22.325
Sure. maybe a few rocks now and then.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.634
And I suppose
he never tried to do any better?

15:25.674 --> 15:28.204
DAN: Yeah. sure. he tried.
but he always failed.

15:28.376 --> 15:32.366
Year after year after year.
but nothing ever grew.

15:32.546 --> 15:35.166
That's not persistence. that's stupid.

15:36.750 --> 15:39.410
Dan. it's true I don't know
very much about your father...

15:39.586 --> 15:41.376
...but from what little I do know...

15:41.555 --> 15:44.575
...stupid is not a word
that I would use to describe him.

15:44.757 --> 15:47.587
And I think you're a pompous ass
for saying so.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.090
That may be.

15:50.263 --> 15:52.423
Doesn't mean it isn't true.

15:52.597 --> 15:54.027
BOB:
The boy's right. judge.

15:56.835 --> 15:59.095
Anybody who'd sit
on the same piece of land...

15:59.271 --> 16:01.601
...for 45 years and never see it produce...

16:01.773 --> 16:04.743
...can't be the smartest man
in the world now. could he?

16:06.811 --> 16:09.281
I never lost hope. did I. mother?

16:09.447 --> 16:12.037
No. you didn't. Daddy Bob.

16:12.215 --> 16:15.615
You had more hope
than anybody in the parish.

16:15.784 --> 16:18.054
Except maybe the fella
at the filling station...

16:18.220 --> 16:21.990
...who tried to check
his fuel tanks with a match.

16:23.292 --> 16:25.562
Mr. and Mrs. Elmore. I'm sorry.

16:25.728 --> 16:29.718
I didn't mean to stick my nose
into somebody else's business.

16:29.897 --> 16:32.387
That's a judge's job. isn't it?

16:33.267 --> 16:34.927
I suppose it is.

16:35.102 --> 16:38.632
Uh. you see. judge.
what the boy did here. it was right.

16:38.805 --> 16:43.235
He got out of that little two-bit town.
made something out of himself.

16:43.410 --> 16:45.940
And I encouraged him all the way.
didn't I. boy?

16:47.280 --> 16:53.380
We sold everything decent that we had.
give him some pocket money for college.

16:53.553 --> 16:58.553
But he did all the rest himself.
the scholarships and the odd jobs in school.

16:58.725 --> 17:01.815
It was the naked modeling
that upset me. though.

17:01.995 --> 17:05.425
-That was an art class. mother.
-I don't care.

17:05.598 --> 17:08.618
Nobody should've been looking
at my little Danny.

17:09.602 --> 17:11.902
Figure of speech.

17:12.069 --> 17:14.839
We gave the boy all we could.
Your Honor...

17:15.006 --> 17:19.876
...and in return.
we figure he owes us nothing.

17:21.112 --> 17:22.942
If you give to your kid just because...

17:23.114 --> 17:25.814
...you hope you're gonna
get some reward from him later...

17:25.983 --> 17:30.484
...well. I just don't know what giving
is supposed to be all about.

17:33.258 --> 17:35.688
You keep up the good work. boy.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.790
We're proud of you.

17:38.596 --> 17:40.356
Come on. mother.

17:43.768 --> 17:45.168
Goodbye. son.

17:46.805 --> 17:50.135
I liked you better in a crew cut.

18:05.190 --> 18:08.220
I know you'll do the honorable thing.

18:13.630 --> 18:17.930
Let me see a pair of them sunglasses there
with the Brooklyn Bridge on it. yeah.

18:18.101 --> 18:19.501
[BOB & MUCETTE LAUGHING]

18:19.670 --> 18:21.540
Huh? Ah--

18:21.738 --> 18:23.728
-How do I look? What do you think?
-Ha. ha.

18:23.907 --> 18:27.137
Aren't we Mr. Broadway? Ha. ha.

18:27.311 --> 18:29.581
-Let's see. that's it. That's it.
SELMA: Wonderful.

18:29.746 --> 18:31.706
-Give them a deal.
BOB: What do you think?

18:31.882 --> 18:34.512
-Oh. they're definitely you.
-Oh. yes.

18:34.685 --> 18:36.615
I'll take them.

18:36.787 --> 18:41.217
BILLIE: We're watching. give them a deal.
MUCETTE: That's something to take home.

18:43.192 --> 18:45.022
So. what's going on?

18:47.463 --> 18:50.493
Picking up a few souvenirs
to take back home with us.

18:50.866 --> 18:53.696
-You'll have plenty of time for that.
-Oh. I'm afraid not.

18:53.869 --> 18:55.499
We're leaving today. son.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.190
Nonsense. you just got here.

18:57.371 --> 19:00.931
You'll stay with me a couple of weeks.
I'll show you around.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.428
Well. but we've got--

19:02.610 --> 19:06.380
Don't worry. you'll be back in time
for the blight season.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.824
-Did you hit him?
-I think he hit himself.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.377
As long as somebody did.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.582
Do you mean this. son?

19:18.357 --> 19:19.977
Of course I do. Mama.

19:20.859 --> 19:24.659
That's the first time you've called me Mama
since we got here.

19:24.830 --> 19:30.530
Yeah. well. you see. I got this. uh--
This grapefruit-sized tumor in my brain.

19:31.801 --> 19:34.431
It's starting to shrink a little. though.

19:36.072 --> 19:39.062
-Can I have a hug?
-Oh. honey.

19:40.310 --> 19:42.800
This is quite a moving moment.

19:42.979 --> 19:47.279
Let me have a cigarette
and I'll well up with you.

19:49.853 --> 19:52.823
Everybody. why don't we go out
after work. get some real food.

19:52.988 --> 19:54.388
-Real food?
-Yeah.

19:54.557 --> 19:58.117
I know this 24-hour Creole place
over on Lexington. They got chicken feet.

19:58.294 --> 20:00.264
-No.
-Yeah. I go there quite a lot.

20:00.429 --> 20:01.659
MUCETTE:
Oh.

20:01.829 --> 20:05.859
Ahem. Yes. I eat chicken feet.

20:07.501 --> 20:09.701
And I like it.

20:10.637 --> 20:15.397
Hey. everybody.
I want you to meet my mother and father.

20:15.576 --> 20:18.836
-Mom. Dad. the lowlife of New York.
-How are you?

20:20.213 --> 20:22.313
Pleased to meet you.

20:23.350 --> 20:28.080
Listen. Daddy. I'm. uh. sorry. I....

20:31.091 --> 20:34.061
-Come on. guys. we got--
-Uh. lacrosse practice.

20:34.226 --> 20:35.786
-Yeah.
-Oh. yeah.

20:35.962 --> 20:37.452
Yeah. that's it.

20:40.266 --> 20:42.326
-Listen. I'm sorry. I. uh--
-I know.

20:42.501 --> 20:44.801
I know what you're trying to say. boy.

20:44.970 --> 20:49.070
-I'd like to say it anyway. though.
-You sure it will be good for your image?

20:50.809 --> 20:52.399
No.

20:53.544 --> 20:54.914
ICHUCKLESI

20:55.078 --> 20:57.208
You always did know
the right thing to say to me.

20:57.380 --> 21:00.440
Well. sometimes.
I was less stupid than others.

21:00.617 --> 21:03.107
Do you know. I still remember
from when I was 2...

21:03.286 --> 21:07.546
...how you comforted me
when Scruffy. my pet turtle. died.

21:07.724 --> 21:11.794
Yeah. we always wanted
to tell you about that.

21:11.961 --> 21:15.631
-Tell me what?
-Scruffy didn't die.

21:15.798 --> 21:17.128
What?

21:17.300 --> 21:21.500
Son. your father and I always avoided
lying to you whenever we could...

21:21.671 --> 21:25.901
...but back then. when you were 2.
we were flat broke.

21:26.075 --> 21:29.935
You had your little heart dead set
on getting a pet turtle.

21:30.113 --> 21:32.413
But we couldn't afford it.

21:32.581 --> 21:34.171
But Scruffy....

21:35.116 --> 21:37.376
Was a potato.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.450
No.

21:41.622 --> 21:42.852
I'm afraid so.

21:43.023 --> 21:45.723
I remember Scruffy. It was a turtle.

21:45.892 --> 21:50.522
He was a potato.
I just painted a shell on him.

21:51.598 --> 21:54.528
Daddy. Daddy. I remember
playing with him.

21:54.701 --> 21:56.971
Well. yeah.
but it just laid there. didn't it?

21:57.137 --> 22:02.867
You never saw no legs. or neck
or nothing on it. did you?

22:03.943 --> 22:05.713
He was shy.

22:06.112 --> 22:07.642
It wasn't shy.

22:07.813 --> 22:09.803
It was a spud.

22:14.186 --> 22:16.376
I don't know what to say.

22:18.791 --> 22:21.821
Someone's dream has shattered.

22:24.462 --> 22:26.792
I loved that potato.

22:26.964 --> 22:29.434
Son. I'm sorry.

22:29.600 --> 22:34.160
I can't believe this. It was one
of the happiest memories of my childhood.

22:34.338 --> 22:37.068
That and my little toy drum....

22:41.112 --> 22:43.952
