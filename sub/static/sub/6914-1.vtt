All right, Laney,
what big party are you

02:13.467 --> 02:14.885
missing out on this weekend?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.511
I mean, it's... it's not
a big deal.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.054
It's just... it's just
the battle of the bands,

02:18.138 --> 02:19.472
something that I've been
waiting for probably

02:19.556 --> 02:20.723
for the entire summer.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.892
Whoa.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.602
Trick question.
Sorry, honey.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.020
I thought you would have
seen that coming.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.605
When you're
with the ones you love,

02:27.689 --> 02:29.440
you're never missing out
because you're exactly...

02:29.524 --> 02:31.859
Exactly where you're supposed
to be with the ones

02:31.943 --> 02:33.945
you're supposed to be with?

02:34.029 --> 02:35.405

I was gonna say that?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.698
Okay, dad, I get it.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.325
What am I thinking now?

02:38.408 --> 02:40.451
A cheeseburger, wrong.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.704
Okay, but are we supposed

02:43.789 --> 02:46.541
to listen to smooth jazz
the entire time?

02:46.625 --> 02:47.959
Here, I'll turn it off.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.462
Oh, it's only stuck on
turning up.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.754
Stop it.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.966
I'm so in love with joy.
And jazz.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.885
Yeah? Joy and jazz?

02:56.968 --> 02:58.260
It's happening to you, isn't it?

02:58.345 --> 02:59.888

It's taken her.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.056

03:18.573 --> 03:20.449
My dad
always was quite the believer,

03:20.534 --> 03:23.036
and he wasn't afraid
to let people know.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.621
Don't get me wrong,
he wasn't in your face

03:24.705 --> 03:26.832
about it like those crazies
with the homemade signs,

03:26.915 --> 03:29.167
but somehow, people could tell.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.585
They sensed a strength in him

03:30.669 --> 03:32.462
that they couldn't put
a finger on.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.714
Friends that were struggling
or questioning

03:34.798 --> 03:36.633
were just drawn to him.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.552
He didn't take them to church,
though.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.802
He'd take them camping.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.846
Oh. Oh, yeah.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.598
He believed
that there was no crisis of faith

03:43.682 --> 03:47.143
that couldn't be cured by a week
up in god's country.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.063
He did his best
to make me a believer too.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.481
It's not
like I'm a militant atheist

03:51.565 --> 03:53.441
or that I hate nature
or anything,

03:53.525 --> 03:55.860
but spending every first weekend
of every month

03:55.944 --> 03:57.862
in the woods with my parents

03:57.946 --> 04:00.406
wasn't exactly my idea
of living the teenage dream.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.532
Honey, I can't keep up with you.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.034
You're going too fast.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.953
Oh, sorry, I forget about
the fun-size legs.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.371
How about a toddler pace?
Does that work for you?

04:07.456 --> 04:09.958
Never heard you complain
about my legs before.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.752
Mom! Stop.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.212
I have to be on a boat today.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.755
- I don't want to be sick.
- Sorry, honey.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.216
We should save that kind
of talk for the love tent.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.969
Dad, you guys
are being so gross right now.

04:21.052 --> 04:25.473
Oh, sorry,
would you prefer love shack?

04:25.557 --> 04:27.517
I think she likes that.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.896
Ah.
Oop!

04:30.979 --> 04:32.981
Dad!
I... I need to finish that.

04:33.064 --> 04:37.564
I'm sure it won't hurt
to keep... Tyson in suspense.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.405
You know the rules, Laney.
Out here we unplug.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.408
Recharge.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.826
Whatever.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.912
I can't believe you still
wear a Fanny pack.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.121
It's actually
really embarrassing.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.497
What are you talking about?

04:49.581 --> 04:50.790
These are cool again.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.334
All the hippers
are wearing them.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.294
They're called hipsters, dad,

04:55.378 --> 04:57.671
and I promise,
you're not one of them.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.426
So is Tyson a hipster?

05:01.510 --> 05:04.513
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.306
Okay.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.767
I'm not gonna always
be here to do this for you.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.979
You'll do it
on your own one day.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.398

05:15.482 --> 05:16.900

07:21.942 --> 07:24.069

Tristan
Samuelson was your typical

07:25.987 --> 07:28.489

07:28.573 --> 07:31.909
Whew, I'll... I'll never forget
the moment

07:31.993 --> 07:34.912
that this amazing woman
was catapulted into my life.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.288
She met him in a support group

07:36.373 --> 07:37.874
for people who had lost a spouse
to cancer.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.335
Our walls were down.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.421
She was supposed
to get help, not get married.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.840
So that I could see
this incredible person

07:45.924 --> 07:48.676
right in front of me,
the woman I want to have

07:48.760 --> 07:51.095
by my side from here on out,

07:51.179 --> 07:52.847
starting tomorrow
at 1:00 P.M. sharp.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.265
That doesn't mean 1:15, Gary.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.184
We will start without you.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.520
So with that, let's raise
our champagne glasses

07:59.604 --> 08:00.855
or our sparkling water glasses

08:00.939 --> 08:03.191
if you're with
the Samuelson clan...

08:03.274 --> 08:05.734
All I could think
about was how my dad would feel

08:05.819 --> 08:09.197
knowing how fast
she was just moving on.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.673
You shouldn't be drinking that.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.092
Champagne has up to a 20%
alcohol level.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.844
Well, I'm not Mormon, so...

08:31.928 --> 08:33.179
It doesn't matter
what religion you are.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.472
You're only 16.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.224
Underage drinking
is a misdemeanor

08:36.307 --> 08:38.142
punishable with fines
up to $1,000

08:38.226 --> 08:39.852
and six months imprisonment.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.604
And who says I'm not 21?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.438
My uncle.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.191
Who's your uncle?

08:45.275 --> 08:49.404
The really smiley guy
who's about to marry your mom.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.655
So what did my uncle Tristan
tell you about me?

08:51.740 --> 08:54.826
He actually didn't mention you.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.285
But don't feel bad.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.828
I've only known him for,
like, two months.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.622
Actually been
seven months, two weeks,

08:59.706 --> 09:00.623
and just over four days,

09:00.707 --> 09:02.875
but I appreciate the hyperbole.

09:02.959 --> 09:06.420
You seem to know a lot about me.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.088
What's your story?

09:08.173 --> 09:10.300
I'm Phoebe Valentine,
and this is my dog, Roxy.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.426
I didn't know you could bring
a dog to a rehearsal dinner.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.013
Oh, Roxy's a service animal,
so she's allowed anywhere.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.808
Aren't you, Roxy?
Yes, you are.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.252
She's so tiny.
What kind of service

09:20.310 --> 09:21.436
could she possibly do?

09:21.519 --> 09:23.020
I have something called anxiety.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.563
Have you heard of it?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.190
Yeah, I have.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.900
It's a very general term,

09:27.984 --> 09:30.695
but I have lots of different
manifestations of anxiety,

09:30.779 --> 09:33.239
so it makes it easier to keep it
under one umbrella.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.283
You can just take her
wherever you want to?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.658
Yup.

09:36.743 --> 09:37.869
That's awesome.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.495
It has its peaks and valleys.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.206
I mean, the entire seventh grade
thinks I'm crazy,

09:42.290 --> 09:44.250
but I get to bring my dog
to social studies,

09:44.334 --> 09:47.628
so what are you gonna do?

09:47.712 --> 09:50.381
You know, I don't blame you
for hiding out in here.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.008
These people
give me anxiety too.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.928
Oh, no, I
love all these people, actually.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.513
I came in here in case
there's an earthquake.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.265
- You're kidding, right?
- I wish I was.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.267
But there's been a spike
in tectonic activity lately,

10:01.351 --> 10:02.518
and I doubt a building this old

10:02.602 --> 10:04.103
has been retrofit
to seismic code.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.938
If the big one hits, this closet

10:06.022 --> 10:07.857
is the safest place
to be in the entire building.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.776
Everyone else would be
crushed like grapes.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.277
Good to know.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.988
Phoebe, can
you come and join us?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.281
Oh, hi.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.282
I didn't know you were in here.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.575
Oh, hi, mom.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.494
This is Lane,
my new cousin, kind of.

10:19.577 --> 10:23.539
Well, almost my new kind
of cousin, after tomorrow.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.208
I'm Holly.
Tristan is my brother.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.294
- Hi.
- Your mom is so amazing.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.463
We've been dying to get
to know you too.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.756
Thank you.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.008
Phoebe, can you come
and get some dessert?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.343
'Cause we're gonna
go pretty soon.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.052
I doubt I could enjoy dessert

10:37.137 --> 10:40.140
knowing the ceiling could cave
in on us at any moment.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.224
It's creme Brulee.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.434
I'll risk it.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.065
Um, thanks for being
so sweet to her

10:50.150 --> 10:51.484
and talking to her, and...

10:51.568 --> 10:53.027
She did all the talking.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.612
Well, I hope you can
get used to it,

10:54.696 --> 10:56.197
because there's gonna be
a lot of it

10:56.281 --> 10:57.532
for the next three weeks.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.074
What do you mean?

11:10.086 --> 11:11.962
It's 2:00 in the morning,
Lane.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.048
If you were gonna blow
off your curfew,

11:14.132 --> 11:16.634
you could at least
tell me where you were.

11:16.718 --> 11:17.969
I forgot.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.762
You forgot?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.514
Kind of like how you forgot
to tell me you were gonna ship

11:21.598 --> 11:23.391
me off with a bunch of strangers
for three weeks.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.914
We meant to tell you
about it sooner,

11:24.976 --> 11:26.435
but things just got crazy,

11:26.519 --> 11:29.939
and we just finalized everything
with Holly today.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.483
I'm sorry.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.277
We, uh, thought it would be
a great opportunity

11:34.360 --> 11:37.905
to get to know your new cuz.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.949
She's not my cuz.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.035
And I'm not spending my whole
summer with these people

11:42.118 --> 11:44.703
that I don't even know
while you two

11:44.787 --> 11:47.539
go cruise the Mediterranean
for forever.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.292
It's 21 days, Lane.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.709
23, including travel.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.213
Who cares?
It's still freaking forever.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.216
I mean, who goes on a cruise
for that long anyway?

11:57.300 --> 12:00.636
We got a killer group on for it.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.263
We know it's a long time, Lane.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.598
That's why we thought
it would be safer

12:03.681 --> 12:04.973
if someone was
watching out for you.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.684
Mom, this is insane.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.895
I'm 16 years old.
I don't need a babysitter.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.480
Can i... can I just stay
here and take care

12:11.564 --> 12:13.023
of myself, please?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.900
Maybe she's right, babe.
Maybe we just...

12:14.984 --> 12:18.112
Sweetie, your mother and I
don't feel comfortable

12:18.196 --> 12:20.281
with you being here
without supervision.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.533
Well, maybe I don't feel
comfortable

12:22.617 --> 12:27.079
with you marrying my mom.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.665
Look, uh...

12:33.253 --> 12:35.129
I know this is hard for you.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.923
We're all just trying
to figure it out,

12:37.006 --> 12:38.799
but I think with Patience

12:38.883 --> 12:42.261
and if we focus on the good
in each other,

12:42.345 --> 12:44.221
over time I think
we'll be able to build

12:44.305 --> 12:46.724
something together,
something new.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.561
Stop trying to fix
everything, okay?

12:50.645 --> 12:54.565
My dad is gone,
and you will never fix that.

12:54.649 --> 12:55.941
I think... i think I should go.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.735
No, please stay.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.570
I think it's best that I leave.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.281
See you tomorrow?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.744
I'm sorry.

13:17.088 --> 13:20.508
Mom.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.996
So, did I ruin everything?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.748
I don't know.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.000
He hasn't texted me back yet.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.883
He said he loves me,

14:02.967 --> 14:05.636
and he's sorry
for overstepping his bounds.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.180
You sure he didn't say
he hates my bratty guts?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.640
He's not allowed.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.560
I birthed those bratty guts.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.856
Are you gonna be okay with this?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.066
Yeah.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.442
I mean, it's only three weeks,

14:20.526 --> 14:23.946
and I'm gonna have
the car, right?

14:24.030 --> 14:27.616
Yeah. But I mean
with tomorrow...

14:27.700 --> 14:30.202
The wedding, and Tristan and me.

14:33.581 --> 14:37.209
Honestly, I don't...
I don't know, mom.

14:37.293 --> 14:41.793
- It's been really hard.
- I know it has, sweetie.

14:42.799 --> 14:46.844
You think you could just
give it your very best?

14:46.928 --> 14:49.805
I promise I'll try.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.519
Can I sleep in here tonight?

14:54.602 --> 14:58.022
Duh.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.108
I said I would try.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.026
What did that mean?

15:02.110 --> 15:06.072
Try to replace the memories
of my father with something new?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.739
Try to not imagine every day

15:07.824 --> 15:11.077
what life would be
like if he was still here?

15:11.160 --> 15:15.660
But I knew I had to.
For her, at least.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.965
Here they come!

15:30.721 --> 15:33.515
I didn't cry like
I thought I would at the wedding.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.517
Something gave me the strength
to deal with all the fear

15:35.601 --> 15:37.394
I had surrounding that day.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.938
I could tell by my mom's smile
that she was truly happy,

15:40.022 --> 15:42.149
and it felt good.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.943
I was actually feeling okay,

15:44.026 --> 15:48.238
like somehow I could find the
strength to deal with all this.

15:48.322 --> 15:52.075
And then she left.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.369
And I pretty much lost it.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.752
Suddenly, it was real.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.463
In my head, it finally clicked.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.633
My morn was gone,
taken away by a cheesy

16:07.717 --> 16:09.093
Mormon dude with perfect teeth,

16:09.177 --> 16:12.180
and I was left
at the mercy of strangers.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.190
I wanted to run away,

16:23.274 --> 16:24.984
but my legs
wouldn't listen to me.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.569
Everything was disconnected.

16:27.653 --> 16:31.698
All I could do was sob
like a newborn.

16:31.782 --> 16:36.282
And like a newborn, I literally
cried myself to sleep.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.289
But the last thought
that went through my mind

16:39.373 --> 16:42.376
before I faded away
was one of hope.

16:42.460 --> 16:46.630
A hope that somehow, some way,
this was all a horrible dream,

16:46.714 --> 16:50.342
and it would all go away
in the morning when I woke up.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.269
I had no such luck.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.022
Here it is.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.704
There's a table
of contents in the front.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.651
It's annotated,
and there are footnotes.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.278
I know you've only been
my counselor for a week,

17:09.362 --> 17:11.041
but I feel like I
can trust you implicitly,

17:11.113 --> 17:13.073
so don't pull any punches.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.575
I have no ego attached to this,

17:14.659 --> 17:17.662
so whatever you say,
I will not be offended.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.413
Does anything jump out
that doesn't quite work,

17:19.497 --> 17:20.748
logistically or otherwise?

17:20.830 --> 17:22.790
- Um...
- What about doctrinally?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.626
Does everything seem sound?

17:24.710 --> 17:27.002
I'm... l'm sure
it all checks out.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.130
It's really good, Carrie.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.508
It... It's almost too good.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.634
I know, right?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.469
Oh, I'm so glad you think so.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.932
Oh, this is gonna be the most
uplifting camp these girls

17:38.015 --> 17:39.016
have ever been to,
thanks to this

17:39.100 --> 17:40.226
dynamic duo right here.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.768
More like you
and sister Rockwell.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.770
I'm just happy to help.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.189
Did you guys work out
your little disagreement?

17:46.274 --> 17:48.567
Oh, yes, Nedra and I had
an amazing talk,

17:48.651 --> 17:50.486
and we really feel
like this plan

17:50.570 --> 17:52.655
realizes all of her goals
as the camp director,

17:52.738 --> 17:55.073
as well as ours
as the young women's presidency.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.450
We really came together
on this year's "trial of faith."

17:57.535 --> 18:00.329
I think it's gonna
be our best one yet.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.664
Wow.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.926
Good morning.
Well, afternoon technically.

18:14.010 --> 18:18.510
It's 12:34.
You slept just over 14 hours.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.684
You're suffering from mild
to moderate dehydration.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.979
You lost a lot of fluid
last night.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.689
Here, I brought a backup.

18:27.773 --> 18:31.276
Thanks, but can I actually
just get some cereal right now?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.653
- I'm kind of starving.
- Okay.

18:33.738 --> 18:38.159
Hi, I'm Carrie Carrington.
I don't believe we've met.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.535
Oh, this is my brother's
stepdaughter, Lane.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.204
She's staying with us
for a few weeks.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.665
Oh, will you be
joining us for camp?

18:44.749 --> 18:46.459
Oh, no, she's staying
here with Ben.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.085
Oh, you don't want to stay
here with boring, old Ben.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.670
Come with us, the mountains
are so beautiful

18:49.754 --> 18:50.671
this time of year.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.089
The weather is perfect.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.008
I mean, wouldn't you
rather come along?

18:54.091 --> 18:55.383
Um, i...

18:55.468 --> 18:59.180
I think she'd rather
have some cereal.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.598
Of course.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.928
But if you change your mind,

19:03.976 --> 19:07.270
the offer's still on the table.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.648
You didn't tell me you had
a nonmember staying with you.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.650
How exciting.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.094
Did I make her
feel welcome enough?

19:14.528 --> 19:16.655
Sister Carrington's really nice,

19:16.739 --> 19:19.283
but she can be a little intense.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.659
Is she, like, a nun
or something?

19:20.743 --> 19:22.202
Oh, no, we call everyone

19:22.286 --> 19:24.746
brother or sister in our church.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.998
I think that's why some
people think we're Amish.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.753
- They do?
- They think a lot of things.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.504
We have got to get her to come.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.089
I'll take care
of all the paperwork.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.424
It'll be no big deal.
I can do it.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.426
Carrie, I'm not gonna push this.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.790
She's been through a lot lately,

19:38.844 --> 19:40.846
and I don't want to force her

19:40.930 --> 19:42.530
into a high-pressure
situation like this.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.142
More like highly uplifting
and highly entertaining.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.811
Camp could be
exactly what she needs.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.355
So what's that camp thing
she was talking about?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.274
Once every year, all the girls

19:52.358 --> 19:54.234
from our church get together

19:54.318 --> 19:55.694
and go camping for a week.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.071
And they plan it for,
like, a year in advance.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.532
This is the first year
I'm old enough to go.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.783
You excited?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.326
Okay, all right.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.121
I trust you.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.080
Oh, but it'd be so great
for the trial of faith

20:07.164 --> 20:08.999
this year if we had even
numbers.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.168
Oh, and then we could do
the parable of the ten virgins.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.544
Even if she does come,

20:12.628 --> 20:13.879
we still wouldn't have enough.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.506
- What do you mean?
- I'm not going.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.840
Why not?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.843
Let me see... bears,
cougars, coyotes,

20:19.927 --> 20:22.554
forest fires, moose...
Yeah, moose,

20:22.638 --> 20:25.015
poison Ivy, poison oak,
poisonous snakes,

20:25.099 --> 20:27.142
wolves, wolverines,
for starters.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.269
She's your daughter.
You have to put your foot down.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.771
It's not that simple.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.398
Uh, until she's 18
it's very simple.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.608
Mainly just because I don't
really fit in

20:34.692 --> 20:36.944
with the other girls.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.695
They don't talk to me
like you do.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.238
How do I talk to you?

20:40.322 --> 20:43.199
Just normal,
like you're actually interested.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.244
None of them really like me.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.621
I'm the youngest one,
the only beehive.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.207
Beehive?

20:50.291 --> 20:53.961
Oh, we call all the first-year
campers beehives.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.962
Why do they call them beehives?

20:56.046 --> 20:58.214
Why don't they just
call them bees?

20:58.299 --> 21:01.051
I've been saying that for years.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.719
Can I talk to her?

21:02.803 --> 21:05.388
Maybe if it comes from her
leader, and not her mom...

21:05.473 --> 21:06.515
Yeah, but I don't think
that's gonna make any diff...

21:06.599 --> 21:08.183
Okay. Phoebe?
Sweetheart?

21:11.061 --> 21:13.396
Lane, could you please
excuse us for a second?

21:13.481 --> 21:16.066
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.862
Phoebe, what's this I hear

21:20.946 --> 21:23.114
about you not coming to camp?

21:23.199 --> 21:24.742
The girls need you.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.827
You're the only beehive.
Your mom needs your help.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.289
I need your sweet spirit.
We're gonna have so much fun.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.290
You have to come!

21:32.374 --> 21:33.666
Of course I would love
for you to come,

21:33.751 --> 21:36.336
sweetie, but I want
it to be your choice.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.380
But it won't be
the same without you.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.799
Come on, just give it a shot,
just for me?

21:45.054 --> 21:48.140
What if I come to the bee's nest
with you?

21:48.224 --> 21:52.519
I mean, what if I come be a bee
in the hive...

21:52.603 --> 21:55.063
What if I come to camp with you?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.149
Will that change your mind?

21:57.233 --> 21:59.109
I'm gonna start packing.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.904
Well, it looks
like my work here is done.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.156
I will see you both bright
and early Tuesday morning, okay?

22:05.241 --> 22:07.618
You are gonna get along
with the girls so well.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.327
Oh, and I can't wait
for you to meet my Bree.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.204
Okay, toodle-oo.

22:13.541 --> 22:14.959
You really don't have
to do this.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.044
It's okay. I want to.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.546
I mean, it might be good for me
to get up in the mountains and...

22:19.630 --> 22:20.881
Thank you.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.205
I just hope I'm not messing up,

22:22.258 --> 22:23.801
like, the Mormon vibe,
or whatever.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.635
No, not at all.

22:25.719 --> 22:30.219

weirded out by anything, am I?

I was done for.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.754
They were bringing me
to a compound to be married off

23:00.838 --> 23:01.922
and hidden forever,

23:02.006 --> 23:03.215
I was sure of it.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.717
The most diabolical part

23:04.800 --> 23:07.219
was somehow, they made it
my decision to go.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.555
- Children of the lord!
- Bring it home!

23:11.724 --> 23:13.475
How did they do it?

23:13.559 --> 23:16.353
Carrie Carrington,
the mastermind, that's how.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.355
You can't tell me
that's her real name.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.023
It sounded like the leader
of the care bears

23:20.107 --> 23:23.318
or the alter ego
of a Christian superhero.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.071
It turned out, her superpower
was endless amounts of energy

23:26.155 --> 23:27.781
without a single cup of coffee.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.491
What are
the young women's values?

23:29.575 --> 23:33.203
Faith, divine nature,
individual worth, knowledge,

23:33.287 --> 23:35.497
choice and accountability,
good works,

23:35.581 --> 23:37.291
integrity, and virtue.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.209
- Virtue.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.044
<i>All right, girls.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.755
Let's really belt it out
for the first years, okay?

23:43.839 --> 23:45.715
Bree was the spawn of Carrie,

23:45.799 --> 23:47.801
equal in enthusiasm and energy.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.387
She was the "president"
of the girls her age,

23:50.471 --> 23:53.474
and she wouldn't go five minutes
without reminding you.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.892
She was usually flanked
by her Bestie, Paige,

23:55.976 --> 23:57.769
one of those genetic lottery
winners,

23:57.853 --> 24:00.146
the kind who would school you
in lacrosse on purpose

24:00.230 --> 24:02.565

more than making up
ridiculous songs,

24:28.258 --> 24:31.219
it's making up ridiculous names.

24:31.303 --> 24:35.803
Hence, the Anderson sisters...
Mykelle, Myleka, and Makenna.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.559
It's like their parents
were playing scrabble

24:37.643 --> 24:39.227
and had to use
the same seven letters

24:39.311 --> 24:41.104
to make seven different names.

24:41.188 --> 24:44.316

24:51.573 --> 24:54.158

24:54.243 --> 24:56.620
I guess when you live
in a community of conformity,

24:56.704 --> 24:59.373
you have to find creative ways

25:07.715 --> 25:09.466
or she couldn't get
her driver's license.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.134
So she decided
to bite the bullet

25:11.218 --> 25:13.762
and bring her brooding angst
along with her.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.597
She claimed to only listen
to obscure bands

25:15.681 --> 25:18.266
or rock legends,

26:00.392 --> 26:03.812
Yup, and you are on box duty.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.606
All right.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.608
Okay, ladies, we are entering

26:08.692 --> 26:10.568
the unplugged portion
of the journey.

26:10.652 --> 26:14.530
Kindly place all
cell phones, iPods, iPads,

26:14.615 --> 26:17.701
androids, et cetera, in the box.

26:17.785 --> 26:21.246
I just got to send
one last text.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.499
"Dear entire JV football team,
I'm gonna miss you so much."

26:24.583 --> 26:27.377
- Send.
- The beauty of mass texts.

26:27.461 --> 26:29.421

26:32.800 --> 26:35.093
Uh, any more?

26:36.970 --> 26:38.262
That's it, I promise.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.057
I guarantee you the Internet
will still be here

26:40.140 --> 26:42.392
when you get back.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.981

26:48.065 --> 26:50.400
Hope our craziness
isn't too much for you.

26:50.484 --> 26:51.818
I'm fine.

26:51.902 --> 26:54.154
Good.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.198
I kept saying I was fine.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.116
I wasn't fine.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.577
If the drive up here was
this bizarre,

27:00.661 --> 27:02.204
how much stranger could it get?

27:15.509 --> 27:17.844
Here comes leather and chains.

27:21.849 --> 27:24.101
Sister Rockwell, bishop Rudd.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.728
I didn't know you two
were coming up together.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.648
Oh, actually,
I blew a radiator belt

27:29.731 --> 27:31.524
up around Jacob's bend
and, luckily,

27:31.608 --> 27:33.401
sister Rockwell
saw me with the hood up

27:33.485 --> 27:35.278
and offered to give me a lift.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.155
Would have beat you here,

27:37.239 --> 27:40.992
but bishop had to stop and toss
his cookies at mile marker 18.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.744
Guess he had trouble
with the curves.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.705
Hey, I want you both to meet
my step-niece, Lane.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.374
She was nice enough to come up
with Phoebe for the week.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.585
Lane, it's nice to meet you.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.255
- You too.
- Soldier.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.008
- Hi.
- Glad to have you in the ranks.

27:57.092 --> 28:00.762
That's a fine-looking Fanny
pack, mark of a real camper.

28:00.846 --> 28:03.098
Too bad you're not one
of my YCLS.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.267
Probably know more than most
of these divas.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.601
Be kind, sister Rockwell.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.269
I am being kind.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.146
They want to be divas.

28:10.230 --> 28:14.275
That's all the rage these days,
just like that bay-once lady.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.818
What are YCLS?

28:15.903 --> 28:19.239
Youth camp leaders.
Bree and Paige, this year.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.532
Good luck.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.909
Hello, my little divas!

28:22.993 --> 28:26.496
Hey, sister Rockwell.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.582
Glad you could make it,
Phoebster.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.501
I was worried
you were gonna go awol on us.

28:31.585 --> 28:35.297
You don't have that little rat
of a dog with you, I hope.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.590
That thing is cute, but it sure
hasn't earned the rank

28:37.674 --> 28:40.259
of a real dog, if you ask me.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.845
Well, lookie here.

28:41.929 --> 28:46.391
If it isn't the famed
bike gang, heck's angels.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.635
Glad you made it in one piece.

28:47.684 --> 28:48.851
Are you kidding?

28:48.936 --> 28:51.355
This is the safest thing
on the road.

28:51.438 --> 28:55.066
I wouldn't trade it for any of
those four-wheeled sardine cans.

28:55.150 --> 28:57.277
Speaking of which,
you wouldn't happen to have room

28:57.361 --> 28:59.863
for one more in this sardine
can, would you?

28:59.947 --> 29:02.407
Oh, sorry, bishop,
no room at the inn.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.284
We are having quite
the sing-along in here,

29:04.368 --> 29:05.744
and it is the party wagon,

29:05.827 --> 29:07.662
so I am sure that nobody
wants to give up a seat...

29:07.746 --> 29:09.038
I'll do it.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.207
- I'll trade you.
- Are you sure?

29:11.291 --> 29:12.709
I'm not sure
that sister Rockwell

29:12.793 --> 29:14.795
feels comfortable riding
with a minor.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.422
- I'm sorry.
- As long as she wears a helmet.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.673
Saddle up.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.300
Um.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.968
It's okay.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.303
Bishop, why don't
you ride up front,

29:23.387 --> 29:24.596
and I'll sit in the back
with Phoebe.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.889
No complaints here.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.809
All right, next stop,
spring lake.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.145
It's real nice of you
to help Phoebe,

29:32.229 --> 29:33.730
but you don't have to do this.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.607
Last chance.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.609
Give the word,
and I'll turn this hog around,

29:37.693 --> 29:41.113
and I'll take you back to town.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.614
I already came this far.

29:42.698 --> 29:43.782
I might as well just
give it a shot.

29:43.865 --> 29:47.577
Ooh-rah.
Now, listen up.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.162
You're very close to the ground,

29:49.246 --> 29:51.665
so you're gonna
feel the vibrations,

29:51.748 --> 29:55.168
and don't be embarrassed if you
let out a few air biscuits.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.629
It's natural.
Let it happen.

29:57.713 --> 30:02.213
Now, hold on tight and lean
with the curves, baby.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.043
Our dear heavenly father,

30:37.127 --> 30:40.088
we are so thankful
to be here at girls camp.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.924
We are thankful
that we arrived safely,

30:43.008 --> 30:46.928
and we are so thankful
for this beautiful campsite.

30:47.012 --> 30:51.512
Please bless us that we will be
safe and keep our hearts open.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.352
Bless us to have
a spiritual experience

30:54.436 --> 30:57.772
and to grow
closer as young women,

30:57.856 --> 31:02.356
and let us be able to enjoy
the beauty that surrounds us.

31:02.527 --> 31:06.364
We are so thankful
for our leaders and their time

31:06.448 --> 31:08.575
and dedication and preparation
that they have put

31:08.658 --> 31:12.036
into making this such
a special experience for us,

31:12.120 --> 31:14.664
and we ask these things
in the name of Jesus Christ.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.249
Amen.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.099
All right,
you beautiful pipsqueaks.

31:33.183 --> 31:34.726
Listen up.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.479
If you were expecting this year
to be a relaxing week

31:37.562 --> 31:40.106
of Kumbaya, you can forget it.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.317
Sister sergeant major
Nedra Rockwell

31:42.401 --> 31:44.236
doesn't believe in easy.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.238
This is girls camp,
not club med.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.032
Now, don't worry.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.576
There'll be plenty of time
for the touchy-feely stuff,

31:51.660 --> 31:53.453
and that's important.

31:53.537 --> 31:55.372
Sister Carrington has prepared

31:55.455 --> 31:57.457
quite the spiritual journey
for y'all,

31:57.541 --> 32:00.627
but as far as the wilderness
survival portion goes,

32:00.710 --> 32:03.087
you're in my world.

32:03.171 --> 32:06.340
Now, we have prepared
three tents,

32:06.425 --> 32:08.427
one for the beehives,
the Mia maids,

32:08.510 --> 32:10.094
and the laurels.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.637
You're to assemble your tents

32:11.721 --> 32:15.307
in your respective ranks
and return and report.

32:15.392 --> 32:18.645
You can solicit help
from the other groups if needed,

32:18.728 --> 32:21.564
but no adults, Capisce?

32:21.648 --> 32:22.648
Capisce.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.359
Now, before I turn you loose,

32:24.443 --> 32:26.528
I'm going to turn the time
over to sister Carrington

32:26.611 --> 32:28.529
for some foofy stuff.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.114
Thank you, sister Rockwell.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.783
Thank you, sister Rockwell.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.328
I have something
special for you,

32:35.412 --> 32:37.872
but if you want it,
you're going to have

32:37.956 --> 32:41.417
to really dig deep.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.130
Well, go on.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.382
Okay.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.552
Come on, girls.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.808
How far down did you put it?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.811
Only one way to find out.

32:59.895 --> 33:00.812
Okay, come on.

33:00.896 --> 33:04.024
Let's go.

33:08.862 --> 33:09.863
What do you think it is?

33:09.946 --> 33:11.322
Oh, I hope it's lunch.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.782
- I'm starving.
- How can you be starving?

33:12.866 --> 33:14.284
We literally just ate.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.910
I don't know, maybe I
have a higher metabolism.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.829
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ladies, please.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.081
We're almost there.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.542
Maybe it's a dead,
decaying body.

33:22.626 --> 33:25.920
Like, of some old prospector
named Wily Pickleshoe,

33:26.004 --> 33:28.548
who died while searching
for the mother lode.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.550
It's not a dead body.

33:30.634 --> 33:33.261
Just a little bit deeper.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.804
- Oh.
- Yes!

33:34.888 --> 33:37.557
Dig it up, dig it up!

33:38.934 --> 33:40.518
Oh. Okay.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.103
What could it be?

33:42.187 --> 33:44.689
Open it, open it.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.487
There's one for each of you.

33:50.570 --> 33:53.030
These are your golden rules
for camp this year.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.991
Each day's theme and schedule
is outlined in great detail.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.036
I've also included
the entire camp manual

33:58.119 --> 34:00.204
as well as all of
your certification requirements,

34:00.288 --> 34:02.164
everything you need
to complete this journey.

34:02.249 --> 34:04.751
Well, what are all these pages
stuck together in the back?

34:04.834 --> 34:06.627
Thank you for asking, Charlotte.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.254
The sealed portion
of the tablets

34:08.338 --> 34:10.214
is for your own
personal journaling.

34:10.297 --> 34:12.842
Simply remove the thick rubber
bands at each end,

34:12.926 --> 34:14.844
and it will reveal blank pages

34:14.928 --> 34:17.304
that you can use to record
your thoughts and feelings

34:17.389 --> 34:19.974
and experiences while here
at camp.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.185
Okay, bishop, is there anything
that you'd like

34:22.268 --> 34:26.313
to add before we kick
this camp into full gear?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.315
Sure.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.985
Uh, girls, these sisters
have dedicated countless hours

34:32.070 --> 34:33.862
to making sure that you
have a good time up here

34:33.947 --> 34:36.407
and that you really
feel the spirit.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.367
You're in good hands.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.411
I'm gonna make myself pretty
scarce around here.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.038
<i>I</i> got my pup tent.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.790
<i>I've got the hunger games
on audio book</i>

34:43.873 --> 34:46.375
so I can finally find out
what all the buzz is about,

34:46.458 --> 34:47.960
so I'll be around
if you need me,

34:48.043 --> 34:52.543
but this week is really
about you, so have a good time.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.384
Thank you, bishop.

34:55.467 --> 34:58.596
Ew.
How old are these teepees?

34:58.680 --> 35:01.265
Sister Rockwell said
she used them at her girls camp.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.268
Uh, more like
Custer's last stand.

35:04.352 --> 35:07.229
Why couldn't we stay somewhere
with cabins, like last year?

35:07.314 --> 35:09.232
The instructions are so old,
you can't even read them.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.359
Oh, who cares about
the instructions, okay?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.527
We'll figure it out.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.029
Besides, if we hurry,

35:14.112 --> 35:16.032
we can get in some lake
time before dinner, so...

35:16.072 --> 35:19.200
Okay, let's do this.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.539
- And then the tall one?
- Yeah, yeah.

35:29.628 --> 35:30.962
Oh, oops.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.552
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

35:38.637 --> 35:40.347
They've never done this before.

35:40.430 --> 35:41.889
They'll never learn
if we baby them.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.265
Yeah, but...

35:43.350 --> 35:44.642
Carrie, we agreed to do
this Nedra's way.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.019
Let's just see how they do.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.106
- Like that?
- Yeah.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.150
- And just grab like...
- Yup.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.776
We have to be precise.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.656
I think this goes
to the bottom of that.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.742
Well, that doesn't seem
like that makes sense.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.535
It looks like a top piece.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.085
Hmm.
Home sweet home.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.461
Is anyone else disturbed

36:12.545 --> 36:14.129
by the plethora
of left over poles and fabric?

36:14.214 --> 36:16.341
I'm sure it's just extra.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.051
Yeah, like, we could build
a whole extra teepee with them.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.887
Do you guys need any help?

36:21.971 --> 36:24.431
Oh, no, I think we're fine.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.351
Do you need help
with the rain cap, though?

36:26.434 --> 36:27.726
I can help you guys.
It's kind of tricky.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.229
Oh, no, it's okay.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.352
It, like, never rains up here,
so we should be fine.

36:31.398 --> 36:33.024
It's probably better...

36:33.108 --> 36:34.400
You know what?
We'll be by the lake.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.526
Come meet us when you're ready.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.944
Bye.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.779
Ooh, I call first canoe.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.281
I call second with Bree.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.866
Wait, Paige and Bree.
Wait for me.

36:41.950 --> 36:42.867
First canoe sounds fun.

36:42.951 --> 36:45.286
Whoopty-freaking-doo.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.970
You... you can go with them
if you want to.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.455
I can probably just
handle this by myself.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.083
Oh, are you kidding?

36:50.166 --> 36:53.002
I want to see what this actually
is supposed to look like.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.129
Okay, help me
with the canvas then.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.008
- Makenna? Myleka?
- Yes, Bree?

36:59.092 --> 37:02.637
Girls, no.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.984
Life's about taking
risks, girls.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.988
- You're living once.
- Sit down.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.033
Sit down in the canoe.

37:24.117 --> 37:26.244
You sit down in the canoe!

37:26.327 --> 37:27.786
What are you doing?

37:27.871 --> 37:30.123
Oh, I like to put the tarp
on the inside of the tent.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.916
It's a little trick
my dad taught me.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.168
- It'll keep us dry.
- The other girls didn't do it.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.337
I know.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.588
Why don't you go grab the bags?

37:37.672 --> 37:38.672
I'm gonna finish this up.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.258
Oh, sure.

37:55.899 --> 37:57.775
Don't tell anyone.
I snuck her on the ark.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.819
Dogs aren't allowed here.
What are you doing?

37:59.903 --> 38:01.571
Roxy's a service animal.
She's allowed anywhere.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.821
No.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.346
It could be really dangerous
for her.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.324
There's a lot
of wild animals out here.

38:05.408 --> 38:06.700
What if she gets out?

38:06.785 --> 38:08.328
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.037
- Don't tell anyone, please?
- It's okay.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.914
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

38:11.998 --> 38:15.001
She's here now, we're gonna
just have to deal with it.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.960
Keep her in the tent
as much as we can.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.505
Only let her out
when we have to, okay?

38:19.589 --> 38:20.881
If she barks, it's over.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.466
Oh, she does not bark,
like, ever.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.760
Let's hope so.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.012
- Time for the devotional.
- Okay.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.847
Put her in the carrier.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.683
This will be our little secret,
okay?

38:30.767 --> 38:32.185
Okay.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.103
You don't ever even
complete all the things

38:34.187 --> 38:36.022
that you need to complete, so
you don't even got the charms.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.856
That doesn't matter.

38:37.941 --> 38:41.277
It d... it matters
if you want to look like this.

38:41.361 --> 38:45.114
Repent ye, repent ye-

38:45.198 --> 38:49.698
the flood is coming.
God is watching you.

38:50.620 --> 38:54.540
Repent!

38:54.624 --> 38:57.543
And behold, the people
were filled with wickedness

38:57.627 --> 39:00.004
and mocked his teachings.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.006
Ha!

39:02.090 --> 39:04.133
And the lord saw that the
people would not listen to Noah,

39:04.217 --> 39:07.428
so he told Noah
that they must be destroyed.

39:07.512 --> 39:11.224
But the lord found favor
with Noah

39:11.307 --> 39:14.685
and told him to build an ark.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.937
And in order to preserve
the beauty and nature

39:17.021 --> 39:19.189
of the earth,
the lord commanded Noah

39:19.274 --> 39:21.859
to bring in animals
of every kind into the boat.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.698
Every kind onto the boat,

39:27.782 --> 39:31.368
and they all came together
in the ark as one family.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.833
Now, remember this as you
face this year's trial of faith.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.793
Which we are totally gonna pass

39:39.878 --> 39:43.423
with perfection this year,
right, girls?

39:43.506 --> 39:45.466
It's, like, the main
activity of camp.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.885
I've never done one, but imagine

39:47.969 --> 39:50.346
a Sunday school lesson
taught by Indiana Jones.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.390
Each of you are
as unique and beautiful

39:52.473 --> 39:55.726
as the many animals on the ark,
so we've put you into twos,

39:55.810 --> 39:57.645
and you're going
to choose a spirit animal

39:57.729 --> 39:59.647
and then discuss
why you chose that animal.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.108
We've provided
some craft materials for you.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.735
Just some basic paints
and construction paper.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.987
Nothing special.
So let's get to work.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.907
- Can't we both win?
- Just pick, fangs or horns.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.993
Fangs.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.535
Something that's, like, admired.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.748
Yeah... yeah, like, the most
important animal.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.207
And, like, maybe,
like, cute hair.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.918
No, yeah.
Perfect.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.045
Everyone's being so boring.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.630
We got to come up
with something more original.

40:24.714 --> 40:26.716
Yeah, animals were so last year.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.676
- Mindy, be careful.
- It's washable.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.764
- Don't move.
- It's cold.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.328
You don't want to look
like a raccoon.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.725
Fine.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.228
We should do something
endangered, like Nanuhals,

40:39.312 --> 40:41.397
beluga whales, condors.

40:41.481 --> 40:42.773
What do you think?

40:42.857 --> 40:44.984
It's up to you.
I don't...

40:45.068 --> 40:47.987
Raar.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.865
All right, so we chose lions
because they're super fast,

40:50.949 --> 40:53.309
they're really strong, and they
just protect everybody else.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.494
Not like we're rulers over you.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.037
Well, uh...
I mean, we kind of are,

40:57.121 --> 40:58.747
but not in, like,
a dictator type way.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.166
Just more of a natural leader
and protector

41:01.250 --> 41:02.167
type way, you know?

41:02.251 --> 41:03.251
Yeah, for sure.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.045
So I wanted to be a lone wolf

41:05.129 --> 41:06.463
because they do
whatever they want

41:06.547 --> 41:08.257
and they're not afraid
of anything,

41:08.341 --> 41:10.092
but Mykelle just loves
bunny rabbits

41:10.176 --> 41:13.179
or whatever, so we chose...

41:13.262 --> 41:17.057
Jackrabbits!

41:17.141 --> 41:19.434
Because they love to run free,

41:19.519 --> 41:21.729
and they're also funny
and clever,

41:21.813 --> 41:25.358
and they have big families,
just like me.

41:25.441 --> 41:28.861
Hannah made us have fangs.

41:30.780 --> 41:34.492
We are the rock giants.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.911
<i>You know, from the Noah movie
which, like, nobody saw.</i>

41:37.996 --> 41:40.331
Well, anyway, we thought
they were totally sweet

41:40.415 --> 41:42.834
and we, like, really wish that
they had survived the flood.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.077
And even though my parents say

41:44.127 --> 41:45.503
that movie is sacrilegious,

41:45.586 --> 41:48.547
I don't care because
Shem and Ham and Japeth

41:48.631 --> 41:50.257
were so hot in it.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.260
Like, I was totes
jealous of Hermione.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.725
We chose dogs because
they're loving, loyal,

41:59.809 --> 42:01.936
and they can sense danger
and warn others.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.688
But also because
they're super cute,

42:03.771 --> 42:05.355
but our dad
won't let us have one.

42:08.818 --> 42:10.569
We chose an endangered species,

42:10.653 --> 42:12.613
Galapagos giant tortoises.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.365
We chose them
because they're wise,

42:14.449 --> 42:15.700
they live to a very old age,

42:15.783 --> 42:17.618
and even though
it may take them awhile,

42:17.702 --> 42:18.994
they always get
where they want to go.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.496
And no matter
how far they travel,

42:20.580 --> 42:24.292
they're never far from home.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.377
All right, what do you say
we sing one more song

42:26.461 --> 42:28.629
before we hit the hay, okay?

42:28.713 --> 42:32.383
♪ The wise man built his house
upon the rock ♪

42:32.467 --> 42:35.303
♪ The wise man built
his house upon the rock ♪

42:35.386 --> 42:39.056
♪ The wise man built
his house upon the rock ♪

42:39.140 --> 42:42.476
♪ And the rains
came tumbling down ♪

42:42.560 --> 42:47.060
♪ Oh, the rains came down
and the floods came up ♪

42:47.607 --> 42:51.444
♪ The rains came down
and the floods came up ♪

42:51.527 --> 42:54.863
♪ The rains came down and
the floods came up ♪

42:54.947 --> 42:56.156
Good night, ladies.

42:56.240 --> 43:00.202
Let us know
if you need anything.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.870
All right, we start at,
like, 7:00 A.M.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.246
Mykelle, Mykelle?

43:03.331 --> 43:04.415
I need just a little bit longer.

43:04.499 --> 43:05.500
Let's see.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.585
So would you rather marry a man

43:07.668 --> 43:10.587
that you know is a serial
killer, he kills every day,

43:10.671 --> 43:11.922
but he's still, like,
a good guy, like,

43:12.006 --> 43:15.509
you love him, or would you
rather marry a man

43:15.593 --> 43:18.804
that all he ever says
is Mahna Mahna?

43:18.888 --> 43:20.431
You ever heard
about mantis shrimp?

43:20.515 --> 43:21.974
No.

43:22.058 --> 43:25.853
So they're, like,
these shrimp that live,

43:25.937 --> 43:27.605
like, way, way, way down
at the bottom of the ocean,

43:27.688 --> 43:28.605
like, thousands of feet under.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.107
Mm-hmm.

43:30.191 --> 43:33.194
And they can get up
to, like, a foot long.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.917
The glacier's so cool
'cause it was, like,

43:34.987 --> 43:37.531
this big block of ice,
and it's... but the mountain,

43:37.615 --> 43:39.175
and you have to hike up
far... pretty far,

43:39.200 --> 43:40.993
- but once you get up there...
- How far?

43:41.077 --> 43:42.995
Uh, I think it's,
like, five miles.

43:43.079 --> 43:44.747
Okay, but, like, if I asked him

43:44.831 --> 43:47.208
what he wanted for breakfast
in the morning,

43:47.291 --> 43:48.250
would he say,
"mahna, Mahna?"

43:48.334 --> 43:49.585
Yeah.

43:57.385 --> 43:59.637
Trust me on this.

44:03.141 --> 44:04.308
Hannah, do you want to...
Do you want Mykelle

44:04.392 --> 44:05.559
to brush your hair?

44:05.643 --> 44:06.883
- You have a little...
- No, no.

44:06.936 --> 44:09.188
- I don't brush my hair.
- Oh.

44:09.272 --> 44:10.273
- Do you want to put Roxy away?
- Okay.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.608
I'll get the light.

44:12.692 --> 44:16.404
- Okay.
- All right, girls.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.405
Good night.
Love you all.

44:18.489 --> 44:21.366
He always says,
"mahna, Mahna!"

44:21.450 --> 44:22.951
Like, "mahna, Mahna."

44:23.035 --> 44:23.952
Mahna, Mahna.

44:24.036 --> 44:26.329
It's... you got to choose.

44:26.414 --> 44:27.614
I... I choose the serial killer.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.208
Good choice.

44:33.004 --> 44:36.465
If an Aspen gets hurt,
like, it shoots out

44:36.549 --> 44:39.969
12 different aspens
from its roots,

44:40.052 --> 44:42.095
and they just keep growing,
and if they get hurt,

44:42.180 --> 44:45.683
they shoot out, like,
10 or 12 more,

44:45.766 --> 44:47.726
and so they're, like,
the largest living organisms

44:47.768 --> 44:49.478
on the earth,
and the largest one

44:49.562 --> 44:52.940
is 106 acres down in Utah,

44:53.024 --> 44:54.442
and it's the biggest thing,

44:54.525 --> 44:56.818
like, living thing on earth.

44:56.903 --> 45:00.823
- Ever?
- Um, yeah.

45:00.907 --> 45:02.158
Hmm.

45:02.241 --> 45:03.575
Oh, oh, do you know
that if you chop off

45:03.659 --> 45:05.827
the top of a pineapple,
like, the leaf part,

45:05.912 --> 45:07.371
and you plant it,

45:07.455 --> 45:09.957
then it grows another
pineapple on top of it?

45:10.041 --> 45:13.919
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah.

45:26.599 --> 45:28.767
Is that rain?

45:28.851 --> 45:31.478
"It, like, never
rains up here."

45:31.562 --> 45:35.774
Remember?

45:35.858 --> 45:38.944
It'll probably just blow over.

45:44.367 --> 45:47.119
We did the tarp trick.
We should be fine.

45:47.203 --> 45:48.954
You think the others are okay?

45:50.331 --> 45:52.833
Is the teepee leaking?

45:52.917 --> 45:55.210
Probably because we didn't
put the rain cap on.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.796
Look how much rain comes
in when I push in the side.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.840
Stop pushing the sides, Mykelle.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.842
We're gonna die!

46:01.926 --> 46:03.594
We are gonna be struck
by lightning,

46:03.678 --> 46:06.263
and we are gonna die!

46:06.347 --> 46:09.350
Forget about lightning!
We're gonna drown!

46:09.433 --> 46:10.809
This is the end.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.812
Come on.
It can't be that bad.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.564
Sister Rockwell!

46:22.863 --> 46:26.533
Katniss drew back her bow
swiftly and mercilessly,

46:26.617 --> 46:28.137
sending an arrow
deep into the heart...

46:32.957 --> 46:34.208
Oh, my gosh.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.459
Oh, my gosh!

46:44.385 --> 46:46.303
Please!

46:46.387 --> 46:49.223
No, no, no.
They're gonna see Roxy.

46:49.307 --> 46:50.808
We have to let them in.

46:50.891 --> 46:53.101
Please let us in!

47:00.735 --> 47:03.446
Oh, my gosh,
thank you guys so much.

47:03.529 --> 47:06.657
You saved our lives.

47:08.701 --> 47:10.744
Think the laurels are okay?

48:05.007 --> 48:08.385
In here!

48:20.731 --> 48:22.858
<i>'</i> Mykelle!

48:22.942 --> 48:25.653
- Close it, close it!
- Close the door.

48:25.736 --> 48:29.197
Oh, my gosh.
Oh.

48:29.281 --> 48:32.492
Guys?
Can you keep a secret?

48:34.787 --> 48:36.371
Ow.

48:36.455 --> 48:37.914
I've always heard the saying,

48:37.998 --> 48:41.126
"no good deed goes unpunished."

48:43.504 --> 48:46.340
This was the first time I really
understood what it meant.

48:51.387 --> 48:54.431
I only logged a total
of about 45 minutes

48:54.515 --> 48:55.599
of sleep that night.

48:55.683 --> 48:58.769
Stop moving.

48:58.853 --> 49:01.397
But at least we were dry.

49:06.610 --> 49:07.902
Roxy.

49:07.987 --> 49:11.824
Thanks for the tip, dad.

49:11.907 --> 49:15.285
Thanks a lot.

49:30.634 --> 49:34.304
Well, lookie here.
A little nest of estrogen.

49:34.388 --> 49:36.431
What happened to my teepees?

49:36.515 --> 49:38.767
Sister Rockwell,
we tried to wake you.

49:38.851 --> 49:40.853
The storm was crazy.

49:40.936 --> 49:43.438
It just collapsed
both of our teepees.

49:43.522 --> 49:44.856
Hmm, that's odd.

49:44.940 --> 49:47.817
This teepee seemed to endure
the very same storm,

49:47.902 --> 49:50.404
and it's still standing
like the Alamo.

49:50.488 --> 49:53.574
Well, maybe we missed
a few steps in the setup.

49:53.657 --> 49:55.700
Lane and Phoebe
seemed to figure it out.

49:55.784 --> 49:58.703
Even used the Campbell
inner lining technique.

49:58.787 --> 50:00.330
What's wrong?

50:00.414 --> 50:02.791
Too proud to take a hint
from the first years?

50:02.875 --> 50:05.043
All right, sister Rockwell.
Let's just calm down, okay?

50:05.127 --> 50:06.503
'Cause I'm sure
that the girls didn't mean...

50:06.587 --> 50:07.879
Calm down?

50:07.963 --> 50:09.464
You're not the one whose gear

50:09.548 --> 50:13.301
is spread all over
god's fine creation!

50:15.804 --> 50:18.723
Okey dokey.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.017
I need to give myself
a little bit of time out.

50:21.101 --> 50:24.145
- Is everything okay?
- Tip-top.

50:24.230 --> 50:26.523
Just need to cool the engine.

50:26.607 --> 50:28.859
I have a system, and it works.

50:30.611 --> 50:32.946
Girls, why don't we
go get some breakfast,

50:33.030 --> 50:36.324
and we'll give
sister Rockwell some space.

50:36.408 --> 50:38.701
Sorry for losing my cool.

50:38.786 --> 50:41.830
After all, it's just equipment.

50:41.914 --> 50:46.001
Just heirloom teepees from
my first year at girls camp.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.586
Well, do you want us
to help you?

50:47.670 --> 50:50.089
No need.

50:50.172 --> 50:52.007
You girls have a big hike
ahead of you.

50:52.091 --> 50:54.176
You better fuel up.

50:54.260 --> 50:56.345
You sure you don't
want any help?

50:56.428 --> 50:58.847
I'm fine.
It's my fault.

50:58.931 --> 51:02.100
I should have helped them
in the first place,

51:02.184 --> 51:04.394
but you'll have
to go on the hike without me.

51:04.478 --> 51:07.439
This'll take the better part of
the day to dry everything out.

51:07.523 --> 51:10.108
Our YCLS have it covered.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.777
I hope that works out for you.

51:23.998 --> 51:28.043
Six miles?

51:28.127 --> 51:30.754
My certification says I only
need to do five.

51:30.838 --> 51:32.881
Well, then I guess you get
to go that extra mile.

51:32.965 --> 51:34.716
- Lucky us.
- Hey, don't blame me.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.384
It was your Okey dokey idea.

51:36.468 --> 51:38.011
They seemed to think
you were up for the challenge.

51:38.095 --> 51:39.721
That's before we had
to pack ten girls

51:39.805 --> 51:41.431
into one tent during a monsoon.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.767
Yeah, while our leaders
ignored our cries for help.

51:43.851 --> 51:46.019
We agreed to forgive
each other, all right?

51:46.103 --> 51:48.605
We were all partly responsible
for what happened last night.

51:48.689 --> 51:50.107
- Except for me and Lane.
- Phoebe.

51:50.190 --> 51:51.649
It's true. We're the only ones

51:51.734 --> 51:52.943
that took the time
to do our tents correctly...

51:53.027 --> 51:55.070
That's enough, Phoebe.

51:55.154 --> 51:57.656
I don't want to ruin it,

51:57.740 --> 52:01.535
but I do have a special surprise
for you at the top of the hike.

52:01.619 --> 52:05.247
If it's the feeling of
satisfaction and accomplishment,

52:05.331 --> 52:07.791
I'm not interested.

52:07.875 --> 52:08.875
You'll have to see.

52:21.722 --> 52:24.307
Get out of here, you horsefly.

52:25.559 --> 52:27.227
Find a horse, why don't you?

52:27.311 --> 52:29.688
I think he already has.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.565
You little brat!

52:31.649 --> 52:33.651
What is the deal, ladies?
All right, guys.

52:33.734 --> 52:35.026
Come on, circle up.

52:37.196 --> 52:39.531
We have been here
less than 24 hours,

52:39.615 --> 52:41.575
and you're already
at each others' throats.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.619
Have you forgotten
why we're here?

52:43.702 --> 52:45.995
I think we
need an appreciation break.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.748
That's right, spread out.

52:47.831 --> 52:48.998
30 minutes solo time.

52:49.083 --> 52:51.251
You can relax,
journal, whatever,

52:51.335 --> 52:53.003
but I just want you to enjoy

52:53.087 --> 52:56.340
yourselves and appreciate
the beauty surrounding you.

53:06.266 --> 53:10.019
♪ When I look in your eyes ♪

53:10.104 --> 53:13.273
♪ The world disappears ♪

53:13.357 --> 53:17.857
♪ 'Cause I love you ♪

53:20.572 --> 53:22.365
Is this our special reward?

53:22.449 --> 53:24.117
Oh, ladies, hi.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.661
Hope you're enjoying your hike
this fine morning.

53:29.164 --> 53:33.418
Looks like you
survived the storm?

53:33.502 --> 53:35.879
Uh, yeah, we got a bit soggy,
but we're fine.

53:35.963 --> 53:37.464
Good to know.

53:37.548 --> 53:39.007
You know, we have a station
just two miles up this path

53:39.091 --> 53:40.634
if you need anything.

53:40.718 --> 53:42.094
I do need to warn you, there
have been some reports

53:42.177 --> 53:45.180
of bears around,
so just be careful.

53:45.264 --> 53:46.640
- Ooh, uh-huh.
- Of course.

53:46.724 --> 53:48.434
And if you do come
across a black bear,

53:48.517 --> 53:51.019
do not play dead
'cause it will eat you.

53:51.103 --> 53:52.104
That's crazy.

53:52.187 --> 53:53.688
Wait, what do you do?

53:53.772 --> 53:55.565
With a black bear
you actually stand your ground,

53:55.649 --> 53:56.733
make yourself a little bigger,

53:56.817 --> 53:58.109
and make a lot of noise.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.777
Well, what about grizzlies?

53:59.862 --> 54:01.782
With grizzlies you actually
do want to play dead.

54:01.864 --> 54:03.699
You're gonna want to cuddle up
in the fetal position.

54:03.782 --> 54:05.408
Hold your neck like this.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.994
It does take guts, but it's
the best chance you got.

54:08.078 --> 54:10.038
As long as you keep your food
tied up or in a vehicle

54:10.122 --> 54:11.039
you should be fine.

54:11.123 --> 54:12.123
Yeah.

54:20.132 --> 54:23.218
Well, we will be heading
on our way

54:23.302 --> 54:25.387
and leave you ladies on yours.

54:25.471 --> 54:26.889
- Bye.
- Yes, on our way.

54:26.972 --> 54:28.056
Bye.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.642
- Bye.
- Bye.

54:30.726 --> 54:33.186
- See ya.
- Bye.

54:33.270 --> 54:35.188
- You guys are ridiculous.
- Phoebe.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.815
Especially you, mom.

54:36.899 --> 54:38.859
I'm telling dad you have a crush
on a park ranger.

54:38.901 --> 54:40.068
I was being polite.

54:40.152 --> 54:41.611
Let's go already.

54:41.695 --> 54:44.322
They were like Greek gods.

54:44.406 --> 54:48.326
Can I journal about
them for 30 minutes?

54:48.410 --> 54:49.786
Was I really flirting?

54:49.870 --> 54:53.290
No, please,
you were only being polite.

54:53.373 --> 54:55.375
♪ Ranger, ranger,
ranger, ranger, ranger ♪

54:55.459 --> 54:57.586
I've been to
spring lake at least a dozen times,

54:57.669 --> 55:00.672
but I have never seen
a hot forest ranger,

55:00.756 --> 55:02.674
let alone two.

55:02.758 --> 55:05.218
They usually have disgusting
mustaches and are really nerdy,

55:05.302 --> 55:06.678
but these guys?

55:07.763 --> 55:09.264
Wow.

55:09.348 --> 55:11.350
Maybe all the praying
and spiritual devotionals

55:11.433 --> 55:13.560
were paying off.

55:13.644 --> 55:16.021
They sure gave us a little pep
in our step.

55:16.104 --> 55:20.604
We could have hiked twice as
far as we planned to that day.

55:20.901 --> 55:24.696
Come to think of it,
I think we did.

55:27.658 --> 55:30.452
Okay, that's really weird.

55:30.536 --> 55:32.788
Does this log look
familiar to anyone?

55:32.871 --> 55:34.247
Don't be silly. It's a log.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.041
They all look the same.

55:36.124 --> 55:38.292
You know, I'm sure it's
just right up around this bend.

55:38.377 --> 55:39.628
Yeah, let's keep going.

55:39.711 --> 55:41.129
Come on.

55:41.213 --> 55:45.713
All right, let's do it.

55:46.134 --> 55:47.134
Are you all right?

55:47.177 --> 55:49.012
No, no, I got it.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.196
Okay.

56:10.367 --> 56:12.118
All right,
that's definitely the same tree.

56:12.202 --> 56:13.745
Oh, my gosh.

56:13.829 --> 56:15.580
I told you we've just been
going around in circles.

56:15.664 --> 56:17.666
No, that's impossible,
Hannah, okay?

56:17.749 --> 56:20.877
I mean, it's... the glacier
should be right there.

56:20.961 --> 56:22.504
Well, maybe it melted.

56:22.588 --> 56:24.548
We could always go back
and ask the rangers.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.716
I give up, okay?
This map is so stupid.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.302
We've been hiking for hours.
We haven't gotten anywhere.

56:29.386 --> 56:30.720
- I'm going back.
- Oh, no, you're not.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.055
I have a special surprise
for everybody

56:32.139 --> 56:33.348
when we reach the top, remember?

56:33.432 --> 56:34.933
We don't care
about the surprise, mom.

56:35.017 --> 56:36.893
Well, then you
better start caring, all right?

56:36.977 --> 56:39.312
'Cause I didn't lug this all the
way up the mountain for nothing,

56:39.396 --> 56:41.815
so you turn your spoiled
little butt around

56:41.899 --> 56:43.775
and start
looking for the glacier.

56:43.859 --> 56:45.277
What's wrong, Makenna?

56:45.360 --> 56:47.820
We don't say b-u-t-t
in our family.

56:47.905 --> 56:49.489
Well, we do in mine.

56:49.573 --> 56:51.373
Okay, let's just take a look
at the map again.

56:51.408 --> 56:53.284
Be my guest.

57:02.294 --> 57:04.546
Look, I think you just
had the map oriented wrong,

57:04.630 --> 57:06.340
'cause that way's north,

57:06.423 --> 57:08.800
and so the glacier
must be that way.

57:08.884 --> 57:10.427
Okay, well, then,
where's the trail?

57:10.510 --> 57:11.761
They can be
really tricky to find,

57:11.845 --> 57:13.805
but I'm sure
if we go that direction,

57:13.889 --> 57:16.182
we'll find a trail marker.

57:16.266 --> 57:18.101
Come on.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.358
See? Trail marker.

57:25.442 --> 57:27.402
Huzzah!
Great work, Lane.

57:29.446 --> 57:32.615
Your last name
isn't Grylls, perchance?

57:32.699 --> 57:34.742
She's our secret weapon.

57:51.385 --> 57:55.885
♪ You believe in me ♪

57:57.182 --> 58:01.352
♪ I have let you down ♪

58:12.280 --> 58:16.742
Don't just rush off.
I have a surprise, remember?

58:16.827 --> 58:19.996
Mykelle! Hey.

58:22.290 --> 58:25.251
I'm not stupid, you know.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.545
I never said you were.

58:27.629 --> 58:28.963
I get it.
You're new, you know?

58:29.047 --> 58:30.798
You want to try
and impress people,

58:30.882 --> 58:34.260
but you don't have to make other
people look dumb in the process.

58:34.344 --> 58:37.347
I'm not trying
to impress anyone.

58:37.431 --> 58:38.974
It kind of seems like you are.

58:39.057 --> 58:41.726
I mean, just be yourself,
you know?

58:41.810 --> 58:44.103
People like you better that way.

58:44.187 --> 58:48.524
I'm just saying.

58:48.608 --> 58:50.359
For the record,

58:50.444 --> 58:52.571
if you've heard that Mormon
girls are perfect little angels

58:52.654 --> 58:55.740
that are never catty
or manipulative,

58:55.824 --> 58:57.617
you're dead wrong.

58:57.701 --> 58:59.786
I'm just saying.

59:02.831 --> 59:05.708
How dare she claim
I was making her look stupid?

59:05.792 --> 59:08.544
She was doing a fine job
of that on her own.

59:08.628 --> 59:10.713
I shouldn't have let
it get to me so bad,

59:10.797 --> 59:12.965
but hey,

59:13.050 --> 59:15.135
I'm no perfect angel myself.

59:21.058 --> 59:22.809
I'm so sorry.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.686
I didn't mean to hit you in the
face. I was just messing around.

59:24.770 --> 59:26.396
I'm sure
it was just an accident.

59:26.480 --> 59:27.939
Of course it was an accident.

59:28.023 --> 59:29.524
That's what happens
when you horse around

59:29.608 --> 59:31.234
like the boy scouts,
and that goes for everyone.

59:31.318 --> 59:32.986
Okay, just take this tissue

59:33.070 --> 59:34.905
and hold it to your nose
until the bleeding stops,

59:34.988 --> 59:36.531
all right?

59:36.615 --> 59:41.115
Maybe I can lighten the mood
with what I have in my pack.

59:41.495 --> 59:45.995
Find a clean patch of snow
and fill up these cups,

59:47.417 --> 59:50.211
because...

59:50.295 --> 59:52.797
It's time...

59:52.881 --> 59:55.174
For snow cones!

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.016
I cannot believe you carried
those all the way up here.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.018
Good thing I did.
We need a morale boost bad,

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.478
myself included.

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:10.022
Plus, up here a little sugar
goes a long way.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.192
- Oh, I got four more flavors.
- What?

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.277
Wait till you taste Pina Colada.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.361
It's so good.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:19.449
- Delicious.
- Except for cherry.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:20.742
- I hate cherry.
- Yeah, both.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.329
- Yeah.
- Get as much as you can.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.506
There's a lot of
flavors to choose from.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.717
Pina Colada.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.677
All right, here.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:44.098
I don't know if I want
tiger's blood or Bree's blood.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.434
- Hilarious, Mindy.
- Disgusting.

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:48.436
Exactly what I was going for,
thanks.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.397
Hey, girls, what do
we say to sister Carrington?

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.608
Thank you, sister Carrington.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.276
You're welcome,

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.696
but as you eat, I want you
to think of something.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.241
How could I come
to share this delicious treat?

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:06.203
Well, it took a little planning,
sacrifice, creativity,

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:07.998
and a little help
from mother nature,

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:11.834
but in the end, oh,
how sweet the reward.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:15.087
Now, look at the bottom
of your cups.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.674
Don't show anyone,
but if you remove the tape,

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:22.257
it will reveal the name
of your secret sister.

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:24.598
We're in the middle of nowhere.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.808
How are we supposed
to buy each other gifts?

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:30.478
You can't. No one's buying
secret sister gifts this year.

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:32.897
You're gonna have to use
a little planning, creativity,

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:35.566
sacrifice, a little help
from mother nature.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.526
Find it, make it,
write it, whatever,

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.612
but it has to come from you,

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.446
and it should mean something.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.740
- Oh.
- Mom.

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:44.909
I didn't say it would be easy.

01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:47.578
I only said
it would be worth it.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.121
I still don't know if Carrie

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:51.082
assigned Bree
as my secret sister on purpose

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.334
or if it was just bad Karma

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.545
for busting her nose
with an ice ball,

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.548
but either way I
wasn't looking forward to it.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.467
That was no secret.

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.558
Welcome home, weary travelers.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:10.963
I was starting
to worry about you.

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.895
I almost sent up smoke signals.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.480
I got the tents all dry,

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:18.526
and you'll find your clothes
on the line.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.738
Sort them out yourselves.
I'm not your mother.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.948
Well, you turning in already?
What's the deal?

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:26.534
We're just gonna take,
like, a tiny nap, okay?

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.536
Who takes a nap at 6 P.M.?

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:32.040
It's... it's been a long day.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:36.919
I don't remember naptime
in the golden schedule.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.504
It's okay.
Let them rest a bit.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.964
I'll just shuffle some things
around later.

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:41.382
As long as you're okay with it,

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.346
but they still have their
dinner duties tonight.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.178
I'll wake them up in a bit.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.722
In that case, I'm gonna go take
hammock duty for a little bit.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:48.973
Jealous.

01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:50.475
You know, come to think of it,

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:51.934
I'm just gonna lay the seat
back in the Van

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:53.602
and just rest my eyes
for a little bit.

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.355
Fine.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:59.900
More time for whittling.

01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:02.362
What's wrong?
You're not sleepy?

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.655
I can't sleep
when it's light out.

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:05.740
Mm.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:07.826
You got a knife?

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:12.163
You'd think after all these
years I'd be a better whittler.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:17.627
I think that's the best-looking
carved mule I've seen.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.504
Trust me, I've seen a lot.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:20.587
I'm just messing around.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:23.424
Messing around? Please.

01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:25.468
64 years, and I've never seen
anyone your age

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:26.886
whittle like that.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.805
What are you working on?

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.140
This is a faith key.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:33.100
I make it for all the girls.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:34.852
This one's for you, oh,

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:37.104
or it will be
when I'm finished with it.

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:38.606
What's a faith key?

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.650
It's a little something
to remind you

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:43.903
that faith is the key
to solve any problem.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:47.490
Big or small,
it all starts with faith.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:48.783
It can't solve everything.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.493
Sure it can.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:53.705
Just not always exactly
in the way you want it to.

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:56.957
You sound like my dad.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:00.045
He was a good man, wasn't he?

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:01.754
How do you know?

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:04.632
Holly thought we should be
aware of the situation.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:07.009
Great.
So now everyone knows?

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:10.596
Just Carrie and I,
and Phoebe, of course.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.598
Are you upset that she told us?

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.892
I just don't see
how it's anybody's business.

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:18.312
She wanted us to know
so that we could be more caring,

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.815
more sensitive
to how you're feeling.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:23.192
Why would you guys care?

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:24.819
I'm not even part
of your church.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:26.446
We don't care.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.822
We don't care
that you're not a member.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:30.617
If you're with us,

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.200
you're family, and we'll try
to treat you as such.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.374
Do you know where this is from?

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.418
- No.
- Vietnam.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:42.879
I got it on
my second tour there.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:45.798
Most people don't know
that there were women

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:48.801
on the front lines,
but we were there.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.887
Most of us were nurses.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:55.057
We were...

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.476
So close to the fighting

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.228
that when the battle
ended they'd bring us

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:03.691
all of the wounded, no matter
what side they were on,

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:06.569
and one of the questions
we were asked was,

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:10.448
"well, what did you do when
you had a viet Cong soldier?

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:12.283
I'd say,

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:16.204
"the same thing we did
with one of our own."

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:18.789
That was given to me

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:23.373
by a viet Cong soldier who was
on the wrong end of a grenade.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:27.048
They brought him to us
in pieces,

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:31.632
but the good lord
helped us put him back together.

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:34.805
I'll never forget the look
of gratitude in his eyes

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:37.016
when he gave it to me.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:41.600
This reminds me that god
doesn't care about sides.

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:43.982
We're all his children.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:48.565
We should treat each other
as brothers and sisters.

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:51.447
So I guess that means
I shouldn't have

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:54.742
chucked a snowball
at Bree's face today.

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:55.827
O" purpose?

01:05:55.910 --> 01:06:00.410
No, I... kind of.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.541
Bet it was a sight.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.335
Blood just went pffff.

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:07.797
Dang, I missed all the drama.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.550
Well, I don't know
how you can make that right,

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.177
but I have an idea
where you can start.

01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:17.181
Now, according
to the golden doohickey,

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.767
Bree is supposed to be
on dinner duty tonight.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:21.477
Maybe you could switch.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.187
I don't know.

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:26.649
She's already accused me
of trying to impress everybody.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:28.317
That'll probably just
make it worse.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:31.195
She's a 17-year-old girl,
so no promises,

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:34.991
but my guess is she'll be
too hungry to complain.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.456
I hope they like it.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.999
It's a family recipe.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.210
Well, if it tastes half
as good as it smells,

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:49.213
you'll be camp queen by sundown.

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:50.965
Is that a real thing?

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:53.551
No, and don't mention it
to sister Carrington.

01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:56.012
She has enough ideas.

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.722
Now for the moment of truth.

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:06.898
Please tell me
this isn't a dream.

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.899
Just like clockwork.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:20.453
Oh!

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.747
Wake up.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:24.957
I think we overslept.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.418
What?

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:32.715
Oh, boy, looks like I got a
visit from the snooze fairy.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.009
Oh, will you look at that?

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:37.011
Everything's set up.

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:38.846
Oh, can I have some?

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.807
Yeah, sure.

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:46.854
Mmm.

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:49.732
Oh, this is delicious.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:51.400
Oh, I'm so proud of my Bree

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:53.319
for sticking to the schedule
without me reminding.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:54.946
Where is she?
I want to kiss the cook.

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:57.031
Sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry.

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:59.033
I don't know what happened.

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:02.745
I'll start cooking right away.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.539
I guess we're not following
the schedule?

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:07.082
You guys were asleep,
and I thought I could just

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:08.584
switch you nights.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.169
You could have
woken me up and asked.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:11.837
It's okay.
Just take her night.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.797
It's not okay. It was my night.
I was supposed to do it.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:15.048
Bree, honey, why don't you
come and get some food?

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.216
I think you might be
a little hungry.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:19.886
I'm not hungry, mom.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.180
I just...

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:22.890
I don't understand
why nobody cares

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:24.809
about following
the golden rules.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:26.685
I mean, we have a schedule,

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:30.104
and people are just doing other
people's jobs and everything?

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.982
- It's just...
- No, she's right.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:34.859
We shouldn't break the golden
rules by helping people out.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.111
Whatever, Mindy.
You know what I mean.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:37.821
I'm just...

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:39.865
I'm just trying to be
the best that I can be,

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:44.411
and apparently I'm,
like, the worst one ever.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:46.371
- Bree, don't say that.
- Oh.

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.040
No, you're not, Bree!

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.500
I was only kidding.

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:51.377
- It was a total joke.
- Bree, honey.

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.837
Bree.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.464
What did I tell you?

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:58.551
I made no promises.
But it ain't over yet.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.886
Here's your olive branch,
my dear.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.270
I was gonna make chicken farm.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:18.569
I just prepared for it.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:25.036
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:26.370
I know I should have asked you.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.037
I just felt really bad
about earlier,

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:30.832
and I wanted to let you sleep.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:40.341
Anyway, I hope you like it.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.301
It's a family recipe,

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:45.848
and if anything,
it fills a hole.

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:47.350
Thanks.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:48.934
You're welcome.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:54.398
There's a
story in the Bible where Esau

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:57.067
trades his entire birthright
to his brother, Jacob,

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:58.694
for a bowl of soup.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:01.864
My dad swore it must have
been bread bowl chili.

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:05.326
Done right, it's the single most
satisfying meal on the plant.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.620
- Oh, my gosh, this is so good.
- I know, right?

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:11.249
It's like there are little bits
of Harry styles in there.

01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:13.000
- That is disgusting.
- Num, num, num, num, num.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:16.378
Seriously?

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:19.757
He claimed
that wars have been fought

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:22.176
and peace has been made
over our family recipe.

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:30.764
Good thing, too,
'cause I needed a win.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.938
Thanks, dad, for real this time.

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:37.399
- One more time!
- One more time.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.568
Janitor style.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:19.149
Roxy, shh, shh, be quiet.

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:20.692
Be quiet.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:33.247
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.875
I don't know what you've got
going on over there,

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.293
but I don't like it!

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:41.129
See ya, Roxy.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.256
Oh, no.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.050
Come on, fess up.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:47.970
Last chance, here I come.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.638
Oh.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.598
What's going on here, ladies?

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:55.519
Phoebe, honey, do you have
something to tell us?

01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:57.354
Uh, sorry to scare you.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.273
It was just me and Myleka.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.400
May I ask
why you're barking like a dog

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:03.110
in the middle of the night?

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:05.529
We couldn't sleep,
so we all decided we would try

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.364
to make the noises
of our spirit animals.

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:09.408
You all decided this?

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.955
Yeah, we thought that it would
help us reconnect to each other.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:22.713
I don't hear any tortoises.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:24.840
Um, tortoises
are completely silent.

01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:26.926
They only make noises
when they're mating.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.677
Okay, I've heard enough.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:33.261
I know you guys are bonding
in some strange, girly way,

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.226
and I think that's great,

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:39.809
but could you please just
save it until sunup?

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.607
- Sure.
- Yeah.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.693
- Totally.
- Wonderful.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.736
I'll see you in the morning.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.280
I am really proud of you girls.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.158
Makenna and Myleka,
wow, you guys freaked me out.

01:12:51.242 --> 01:12:53.244
You sounded just like Roxy.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:55.746
- That's crazy.
- Good night.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:58.999
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:00.417
Good night.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.881
I thought you said
they didn't like you.

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:09.718
I'm as surprised as you are.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.969
- Are you kidding?
- What's wrong?

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:54.346
We're just being
our spirit animals.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.599
Spirit animals?
Really, mom?

01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:59.351
- What kind of animal was that?
- That's my cougar.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.645
It sounded
more like an angry gerbil.

01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:03.772
Well, this gerbil
wants you guys to wake up.

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:06.316
It's the long-awaited day
of the trial of faith.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.859
Hurry, up and at 'em, girls.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:08.945
Come on.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:10.279
Let's do this.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:11.906
I have never lost
a trial of faith,

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:14.866
and I'm not about to do it now,
so get up.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.870
Bree, wait. Don't we
have a service project first?

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.205
- Ugh.
- She's right,

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:23.208
and I have a doozy
lined up for you.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:26.461
Can we please just sleep
for a half an hour longer?

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:28.213
It is so early.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.216
No. The rangers
are coming in a half hour.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.219
If you want to have food
in your belly before we leave,

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.346
you better get going.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.588
I don't know
what all the fuss is about.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.757
They're just gonna
get dirty anyway.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.968
Oh, it's just nice
to look presentable, you know?

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:16.386
Yeah,
for your ranger boyfriends, mom.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:19.389
Phoebe!

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:21.475
Oh, there you are, bishop.

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:22.518
I was getting worried about you.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:23.601
Sorry, sorry.

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:24.686
I just finished book two.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.396
It's so addicting, right?

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.523
That Katniss is so resilient.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.483
Here are the coordinates
to the ark.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:32.903
Follow the instructions
precisely.

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:35.406
This is kind of the capstone
of the entire theme,

01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:37.449
so we have to get everything
just right.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:38.867
- I won't let you down.
- Okay.

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:41.078
We should be there
sometime this evening.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:42.246
Thank you so much.

01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:43.413
Sure.

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:45.665
All right, let's move!

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:47.084
Come on!

Well, well, well.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.737
May I say you ladies
look lovely this morning?

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.823
You really do,
and I'm sorry we're late.

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:00.574
That's on us.

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:02.201
Ranger Hobie here thought
he saw a yellow-billed cuckoo

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:04.404
on the way up here, so we had
to stop and investigate.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:05.954
Turns out I'm the cuckoo.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.206
It was just a mockingbird
up to his old tricks.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.833
- Yeah.
- I'm not surprised.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.627
Yellow-billed cuckoos
are rarely found this far west.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.712
Well, lookie here.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.256
Not only is she cute, but she's
got a brain in her head.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.091
Hopefully she's got some muscles

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:20.385
on the old arm skies, 'cause
we got a lot of fences to mend.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:24.389
Um, will ranger Craig
or ranger Jeff be joining us?

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:25.765
No, sorry.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.434
You're stuck with us,

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:29.436
but word on the trail
is we're pretty cool too.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.979
Where did they go?

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:32.689
They got sent
on a special mission.

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:34.191
- Yeah.
- Really?

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:35.526
During the flash flood
a bevy of otter pups

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:37.611
- got separated from mama otter.
- Oh.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:39.988
So they're out there just
working around the clock

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.531
trying to get that family
reunited.

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:42.991
Do they need any help?

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.827
I don't think they do,
but good news.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:47.454
We need a lot of help,

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:51.291
so what do you say
we all get this party started?

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.376
Break it down.

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:53.626
Where do we start?

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.170
Glad you asked.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:56.964
We're gonna
take all of the decayed logs,

01:17:57.047 --> 01:17:59.507
pop them off this fence, and
load them up over by the truck.

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:01.385
Once that's done-zarino,

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:04.804
we're gonna put the new ones
on where the old ones once were.

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:07.933
Yup, just... we got a lot of work
after that too.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:10.728
It's gonna be lots of work,
all day 'round.

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.145
I'm totally telling dad

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:13.521
that you have a crush
on a park ranger.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.107
Please stop talking.

01:18:22.198 --> 01:18:26.698

It's probably better we
didn't see ranger Craig and Jeff again.

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:58.650
They probably wouldn't have
lived up to the images

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:02.779
of perfection
we'd created in our minds.

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:05.532
The new guys were nice
and really helpful,

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:07.576
mustaches and all.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.078
It didn't take long
for Charlotte

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.621
to find them cute in a way.

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:14.791
They were still boys, after all.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:17.586
There was something
special about that morning

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.797
that had nothing
to do with the rangers.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.506
It was the first time

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:25.468
that everyone was together
and everyone was having fun.

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:29.889
It was hard work, but we built
something awesome together.

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:34.395
Best of all, there was no drama.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:39.899
Until we got back to camp.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:41.276
We got to hurry up
'cause I need a snack

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.737
- before we start our trial.
- Right.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.197
I know, I'm hungry too.

01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:58.877
Is this a prank?

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:02.547
No, it was a bear.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.090
A bear?

01:20:04.174 --> 01:20:06.134
We have to go
tell the leaders. Come on.

01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:13.141
Roxy. Roxy.

01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:22.692
Roxy.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:26.571
Roxy?

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.491
Roxy?

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:30.784
Roxy?

01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:32.077
- What happened?
- It was destroyed.

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:36.661
Oh.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.041
Stay together.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:40.794
The bear still may be near.

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:43.463
Is everyone here?

01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:45.757
- Where's Phoebe?
- She was just here.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.592
- She was just with us.
- Phoebe?

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:51.429
Phoebe? Phoebe? Phoebe?

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.350
Phoebe?

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:56.768
Phoebe?

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:58.395
Phoebe?

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:01.190
- Roxy's gone.
- We left Roxy at home.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:02.857
Phoebe snuck her in the ark.

01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:04.567
We've been hiding her.
I'm so sorry.

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:06.486
- I should have told you.
- We have to go after her.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.113
Holly, wait!

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:11.241
You stay here,
and you stay together!

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:12.743
- Holly, wait.
- Let's say a prayer.

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:15.245
Come on.

01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:16.830
Dear heavenly father,

01:21:16.914 --> 01:21:19.082
please bless that we'll
be able to find Phoebe.

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:20.667
Roxy?

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:21.918
Please protect her
from the bear.

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:24.087
- Please keep Roxy safe.
- Roxy?

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:27.757
We ask these things in
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:29.217
Amen.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:30.927
- She went this way.
- How do you know?

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.095
The tracks go in this direction.

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.555
They went the wrong way.

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:35.766
Wait, we're supposed
to stay here.

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:37.725
We have to go after her!

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:38.852
I'm going with her.

01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:39.937
Bree?

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:43.398
Roxy? Come here, girl.

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:44.941
Roxy?

01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:48.778
Phoebe? Phoebe?

01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:51.322
Phoebe?

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:52.950
Phoebe?

01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:55.118
Roxy?

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:58.705
Roxy, come on, girl.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:01.583
Roxy?

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:05.796
Phoebe? Lane?

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:09.132
Roxy? Roxy?

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.427
R...

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.059
Roxy?

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:30.403
Oh, my... please, no.

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:34.282
Phoebe.

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:38.411
Roxy.

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:42.081
Lane.

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:44.918
I'm so sorry.

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:46.753
I am so sorry.

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:49.089
Phoebe?

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:52.926
Phoebe, oh,
we were so worried about you.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.928
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:56.179
Let's get you back to camp.

01:22:56.263 --> 01:22:58.431
Come on, let's get you back.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:03.937
Oh.

01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:05.814
Everything's gonna be okay.
I promise, okay?

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:08.025
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be okay.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.527
Stop telling her
everything's gonna be okay!

01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:12.362
Her dog is dead.
That's not okay.

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:15.073
Maybe she's still alive.
Let's just say a prayer and...

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:18.785
You already said a prayer,
and it didn't work, okay?

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:21.788
Just leave us alone and let
us deal with this right now.

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:24.499
Praying is not gonna help.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:32.048
Look, i... l'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you. I...

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.683
What do we do?
What do we do?

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:43.643
Phoebe, that... that's a grizzly
bear, not a black bear, right?

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:44.936
It's a grizzly bear.
I'm pretty sure.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:45.937
Okay, me too.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:46.980
Do you remember what to do?

01:23:47.064 --> 01:23:48.690
Play dead and cover your neck.

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:50.984
- Okay, I think she's right.
- Wait, are you sure?

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:53.403
Get down.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:37.530
For some
people, praying comes naturally.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:39.157
For others,
they have to be sniffed

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.659
by an 800-pound grizzly bear

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:43.119
before they realize
its importance.

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:49.334
We probably sat there
in the fetal position

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.336
for a good 30 minutes
before we dared look up

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:54.881
and see if the bear
had really gone.

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:57.300
A good part of me didn't
want to move at all.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:58.885
I knew the moment we did,

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:01.096
Phoebe would have
to be reminded of her pain,

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:04.932
and I couldn't stand
to see her that way.

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:09.604
Well, it looks like Cain's
about six miles east by now.

01:25:09.688 --> 01:25:11.231
How can you be sure?

01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:13.066
Well, we tag all the bears
for research purposes,

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:15.902
and when we need to find them,
we turn on the old GPS.

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:17.946
- Boop.
- We'll keep an eye on him.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:20.073
You guys should be okay
to stay here as long as you

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:21.825
keep your food tied up.

01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:24.452
And if you have any candy,
you must stash it away.

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:26.162
Mustache, that's how I remember.

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:27.914
That's very nice of you, sir,

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:30.667
but I think it would be better
if we packed out early.

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:32.627
Okay, well, let us know
if we can do anything for you.

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:35.130
We're here
for you and mother nature.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:36.631
- Thank you.
- All right, thanks.

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:38.550
All right.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.186
You heard it, ladies.

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.397
Tear it down,
or what's left of it.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:55.066
Wait, this is all my fault.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.569
I'm the one that left
the syrup out like an idiot.

01:25:57.653 --> 01:25:59.821
Don't punish the girls
because of my carelessness.

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:04.242
No, it's my fault. He probably
smelled dog food too.

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.161
Phoebe didn't know any better.

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.788
There's no need
to play the blame game.

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:11.332
We're a team, a unit.

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:15.044
We're all responsible
for our failure here.

01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:17.338
Come on, we're burning daylight.

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:20.967
All right, I'll call the bishop
and tell him to head down.

01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:22.886
Okay, just hold on.

01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:24.971
I have been reciting the young
women's values my whole life,

01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:27.974
and I don't remember
quitting being one of them.

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:30.143
Do you remember the one
that's integrity?

01:26:30.227 --> 01:26:32.812
Or how about choice
and accountability?

01:26:32.896 --> 01:26:34.439
Yeah, that's just it.

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:37.984
I mean, how can we be
accountable if we just give up?

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:41.529
Look, I know that we messed up.
We lied about Roxy.

01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:43.406
We haven't been treating each
other the way that we should,

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:46.910
but how can we make things right
if we just go home?

01:26:46.993 --> 01:26:50.204
We have so many more amazing
things that we need to do here,

01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:52.123
and I don't know about you guys,

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:55.710
but I desperately need
a trial of faith right now.

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:58.546
So please, just forgive us
for messing up

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:02.133
and give us a chance
to make it right.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:06.387
Well, girls,
your president has spoken.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:10.141
Is that what you want,
another chance?

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:14.395
How about you, Phoebster?

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:18.649
I want to go home.

01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:20.986
She's hurt enough, girls.

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.071
Let's go.

01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:45.760
I know exactly
how you feel right now.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:47.428
Your stomach's all clenched,

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:52.012
and your head feels
like it'll never stop pounding,

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:56.396
and your heart...

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.650
Feels like it's just gone.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:05.234
It's the scariest feeling
in the whole entire world,

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:09.868
and you feel like it's never,
ever gonna go away.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:14.451
And in a way, it wouldn't
feel right if it did,

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:19.252
but I promise you

01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:22.922
that Roxy doesn't want
you to feel this way.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:25.383
If she were here right now,
she'd...

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:28.178
She'd run right up to you,
she'd lick your face,

01:28:28.261 --> 01:28:32.056
and she'd tell you
she loves you,

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:36.640
tell you it's okay for you
to try and be happy again.

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:41.109
She'd want you to look around
at all these people

01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:44.777
who love you
and who are here for you

01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:49.323
and who want to help you
through this.

01:28:49.407 --> 01:28:53.035
If you want to go home,
we'll go, okay?

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:56.664
Just say the word,
and we're out of here.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:59.292
But if you want to try and stay

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:03.876
and fight through this together,

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:08.881
we are all here for you.

01:29:09.135 --> 01:29:10.845
What do you say?

01:29:14.057 --> 01:29:16.601
I want to try.

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.395
For Roxy.

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:28.529
You all set for this?

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:31.699
Finalized everything
with the bishop this morning.

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:35.077
Okay, you asked for it.

01:29:35.161 --> 01:29:36.829
Time for the trial of faith.

01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:38.789
Yeah!

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:43.374
If you can complete the trial
as a group before sundown,

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:45.630
then you've earned
the right to stay.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:49.300
If not, then it's sayonara,
sweethearts.

01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:51.552
Is that fair?

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:53.304
- Yes.
- Ooh-rah!

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:55.264
Ooh-rah!

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:59.848
This year's trial of faith
is a quest to reach Noah's ark.

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:02.647
Will you be fit
to enter the ark,

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.859
or will you be washed away?

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:10.196
You must complete this task
together using only the supplies

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.825
provided in the backpack
in front of you, the holy Bible,

01:30:13.909 --> 01:30:17.287
and your knowledge
of the golden rulebooks.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:21.870
Prepare to be tried
both spiritually and temporally.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:23.877
Mom, we love you,

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.670
but can we just please have
the first instruction?

01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:27.964
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:35.430
"And behold,
as the daughters of Noah

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:38.891
did journey to the ark, they
were struck with a plague."

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:41.769
The first trial
and already a plague? Come on!

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:44.689
"Behold, even their leaders,
Bree and Paige,

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:47.567
became ill with fever."

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:52.405
No! Um,

01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:55.492
"Phoebe was struck lame,

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:57.994
and Lane fell to the earth
as if she were dead."

01:30:58.078 --> 01:30:59.621
I wanted that one.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.956
"Those who were spared
did say unto one another,

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.375
"'let us bring them
to the fount of pure water

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:06.377
"that they may drink
and be cleansed."'

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:07.545
the spring?

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:09.672
Dibs on Phoebe.

01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:14.256
- Mykelle.
- To the spring.

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:16.512
Faster.

01:31:16.596 --> 01:31:18.556
Charlotte.
Okay, one, two.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:24.228
Pretty quick start.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.397
And a first aid certification.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:30.067
Pound it.

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:32.194
- Let's not do that again.
- No.

01:31:32.278 --> 01:31:36.031
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- I'm a-hurrying.

01:31:36.116 --> 01:31:40.161
- Faster.
- Okay, okay.

01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:41.245
One, two. One, two.

01:31:41.287 --> 01:31:42.204
One, two.

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:44.331
One, two.

01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:45.667
Guys, come on.

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:47.668
Hurry up, we're almost there.

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:51.005
Easy for you to say.
You're not carrying a moose.

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:54.008
- Hey!
- Oh, a very cute moose.

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:56.636
Mykelle, Mindy,
just go on without us.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.055
- Go get the next clue, okay?
- Yes, Bree.

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:00.890
Fast, fast,
right around the bend.

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:02.350
Go, go.

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:05.437
We got one chance
to make this right.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.065
Oh, my gosh, so much pressure.

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:31.337
Why do you need that?

01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.464
Trust me.

01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:03.911
Bible time.

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:05.496
Come on, come on. We got to go.
We got to go. We got to go.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.123
She's gonna be so happy
we found it.

01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:09.042
Mindy, you're going so fast!

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:12.545
"Depart ye, depart ye,
go ye out from thence.

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:14.297
"Touch no unclean thing.

01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:15.839
"Go ye out of the midst of her.

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:19.427
"Be ye clean, that bear
the vessel of the lord."

01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:21.387
- What does that mean?
- It's Isaiah.

01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:22.972
No one knows what that means.

01:33:23.056 --> 01:33:27.018
Vessel of the lord,
like, his blood vessels?

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:28.686
The vase. That's the vessel.

01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:30.480
It must be dirty.

01:33:30.563 --> 01:33:34.108
We have to purify the vase.

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:35.902
We need a fire.

01:33:35.985 --> 01:33:40.155
Okay, those of you who have use
of their legs, grab wood, twigs,

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.033
and pine needles.

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:46.329
Also, we're gonna need eight
to ten stones for a fire circle.

01:33:46.412 --> 01:33:49.748
No, Lane, you can't help until
we cure your plague, remember?

01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:51.251
Right, sorry.

01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:53.127
Hey, guys,
I don't see any matches in here,

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:57.711
but I did find this really cool
monocle and old-timey mustache.

01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:12.230
We've made a huge mistake.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:18.235
Don't watch it, Makenna.
Keep your eyes shut.

01:34:21.197 --> 01:34:22.781
Hurry!

01:34:22.866 --> 01:34:25.702
I had to cool it so it
wouldn't burn your face, Bree.

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:31.248
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:33.835
Nice to be alive again.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.669
- Good to have you back.
- So what now?

01:34:35.753 --> 01:34:37.045
Where's the next clue?

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:38.673
Was there another clue
back there?

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:41.133
- No, Bree.
- Well, maybe the trial's over

01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:42.426
and we just won.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.136
Hey, cheers.

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:45.429
We did it!

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:47.890
What's that?

01:34:49.392 --> 01:34:50.643
More Isaiah.

01:34:50.727 --> 01:34:51.644
Great.

01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:53.312
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah.

01:34:53.396 --> 01:34:55.398
Isaiah 30:14.

01:34:57.483 --> 01:34:59.985
Okay. "It will break in pieces
like pottery,

01:35:00.069 --> 01:35:02.821
"shattered so mercilessly that
among its pieces not a fragment

01:35:02.906 --> 01:35:04.991
"will be found
for taking coals from a hearth

01:35:05.074 --> 01:35:06.825
or scooping water
out of a cistern."

01:35:10.914 --> 01:35:13.625
Okay, that one was pretty
straight forward, actually.

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.086
Guys, look.

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:24.594
All right, girls.
Keep your bibles handy.

01:35:24.677 --> 01:35:25.719
This is the marker.

01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:27.054
- We start from here.
- Okay.

01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:30.266
First direction,
northeast 49 degrees.

01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:32.060
Okay, how many paces?

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:34.395
"The number of days
the flood lasted

01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:36.314
"times the days
it took to create the earth

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:39.817
divided by the width
of the ark in cubits."

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:42.570
- 230.
- That was fast. Are you sure?

01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:44.489
Yeah, 40 times <i>7</i> is 280,

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.032
minus 5o cubits wide
is, like, 230.

01:35:47.116 --> 01:35:48.617
- Good job, Charlotte.
- Yeah.

01:35:48.701 --> 01:35:49.861
- Great job.
- What can I say?

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:51.621
Guys like smart chicks.

01:35:51.704 --> 01:35:54.748
Not to be painfully ironic,
but it's actually 190.

01:35:54.832 --> 01:35:56.542
Uh, Phoebe, I just did the math.

01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:58.210
God created earth in six days.

01:35:58.294 --> 01:36:01.213
He rested on the seventh one,
so 6 times 40 is 240,

01:36:01.297 --> 01:36:02.631
minus 50 is 190.

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:04.550
- Technically she's right.
- Oh.

01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:06.302
You were almost there, though.

01:36:06.386 --> 01:36:10.886
It's okay. Guys like
almost-smart girls too.

01:36:11.057 --> 01:36:13.017
Okay, ready? One, two...

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:16.604
Three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:21.188
186, 187, 188, 189, 190.

01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:23.361
Nice marker, mom.

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:24.987
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:36:25.071 --> 01:36:28.616
Okay, second direction,
"290 degrees northwest."

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.326
Okay, how many paces?

01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:33.579
"The length of the ark
in cubits plus Noah's age

01:36:33.663 --> 01:36:37.583
at the time of the flood divided
by Goliath's height in feet."

01:36:37.667 --> 01:36:39.835
Easy, 100, give or take.

01:36:39.919 --> 01:36:42.588
300 cubits long plus 600 is 900.

01:36:42.672 --> 01:36:45.549
Goliath was roughly 9 feet tall,
so it's not exact,

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:46.717
but it's about 100.

01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:48.135
Where did you get 9'?

01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:50.304
Mine says he was
6 cubits and a span.

01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:53.557
Exactly. A cubit's 450
millimeters or 18 inches,

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:57.645
and so that would be 3.2 meters
or 9 1/2 feet tall.

01:36:57.729 --> 01:36:59.689
A span's, like, this big.

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:01.482
Guys,
these are common conversions.

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.359
Everyone should know them.

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.319
I think you're
actually smarter than Siri.

01:37:05.403 --> 01:37:06.654
Come on, guys.

01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:07.697
- Let's keep moving.
- All right.

01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.823
One, two, three, four.

01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:13.619
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:37:13.703 --> 01:37:15.246
Guys, look at the sun.

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:16.914
We're running out of time.
We have to hurry.

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:18.582
I know, I know.
This is the last one.

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:21.418
"Number of days the floodwater
prevailed on the land

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:25.088
"times how high the water rose
in cubits divided by

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:28.426
"the number of lepers that did
not return to thank Jesus

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:31.345
"plus the number of sheep

01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:34.640
"left behind when he went to
find the one minus the one

01:37:34.724 --> 01:37:37.810
"he went to save
times the number of cattle

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:40.313
"in pharaoh's dream
minus the age of Methuselah

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:42.106
when Noah was born."

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:43.649
- Come on, Phoebe.
- Guys, I'm not gonna do it.

01:37:43.733 --> 01:37:45.151
I'm not gonna be able
to finish this one.

01:37:45.234 --> 01:37:47.819
- No, no, Phoebe.
- You can't give up now.

01:37:49.572 --> 01:37:52.533
No, I refuse to even
think another second about it.

01:37:52.617 --> 01:37:54.493
<i>I am why?</i>

01:37:54.577 --> 01:37:56.120
'Cause I see the ark.

01:37:58.623 --> 01:38:03.123
- Come on.
- Whoo!

01:38:03.336 --> 01:38:05.713
- Come on!

01:38:18.935 --> 01:38:21.729
Okay, there has to be a way in.

01:38:21.813 --> 01:38:23.189
Is there a note or something?

01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:25.065
Girls, look to the sides.

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:31.405
Uh, is there anything
left in the backpack we can use?

01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:35.989
Um, just the stuff
we already used.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.619
Oh, and this stupid faith key

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:39.287
that sister Rockwell's
always making us.

01:38:39.372 --> 01:38:41.374
Oh, my gosh, you guys,
we have to find a way, okay?

01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:42.708
We're so close.

01:38:42.792 --> 01:38:43.918
I know how we're gonna get in.

01:38:44.001 --> 01:38:45.669
- How?
- Faith.

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:47.337
It's the key.

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:48.756
Okay, are you just
making fun of us?

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.966
Like, I honestly can't tell.

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:51.759
No, literally, the faith key.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:53.302
That's how we get into the ark.
Look for a keyhole.

01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:54.470
We've already looked everywhere.

01:38:54.554 --> 01:38:55.754
We're not gonna find anything.

01:38:55.805 --> 01:38:56.764
Look harder, Hannah, okay?

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:58.224
We have to find it.

01:38:58.307 --> 01:39:00.267
All right.
Okay, um...

01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:03.228
Keyhole, keyhole,
keyhole, keyhole.

01:39:07.984 --> 01:39:08.985
- I see it!
- Yes!

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:21.955
Give me the key.

01:39:28.087 --> 01:39:30.089
Enter, my little animals.

01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:32.799
No way!

01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:35.845
You did it, Lane, oh!

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:40.182
Careful. Duck your head.

01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:41.767
It was the key.

01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:45.521
- Oh, goodness.
- You did it.

01:39:45.605 --> 01:39:47.857
You survived the flood.

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:49.733
Um, what flood?

01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:01.245
I think that's as far
<i>as</i> she's gonna go.

01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:04.415
It's just not as epic
as I'd pictured in my mind,

01:40:04.499 --> 01:40:06.459
you know?

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:08.222
Still wish
you were on that boat with them?

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:12.214
You know, it's funny.
I spent countless months

01:40:12.298 --> 01:40:15.676
building that ark and trying
to make everything perfect

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.887
and worrying that it
wasn't all gonna come together,

01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:21.014
and then something magical
happens like this, you know,

01:40:21.098 --> 01:40:25.560
that they all come together,
and it just...

01:40:25.645 --> 01:40:30.145
It helps me realize that it
wasn't about me or the binder

01:40:30.399 --> 01:40:32.192
or the ark or any of that.

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:34.278
It's just all about them.

01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:37.948
So as much as I'd love to be
on that boat right now, i...

01:40:38.032 --> 01:40:41.201
I'm okay just cheering them
on from the sidelines, you know?

01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:44.204
Yeah.

01:40:44.288 --> 01:40:47.040
At least we tried.

01:40:47.124 --> 01:40:49.543
All right, ladies.
Let's take this party up top.

01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:52.296
♪ Come thou fount ♪

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.965
♪ Of every blessing ♪

01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:57.593
- ♪ Tune my heart to ♪
- this is totes beautiful.

01:40:57.677 --> 01:41:00.012
♪ Sing thy grace ♪

01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:01.972
♪ Streams of mercy ♪

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:04.600
Great job, ladies.

01:41:04.684 --> 01:41:06.018
Good job!

01:41:06.102 --> 01:41:07.228
- Oh, we're so proud.
- We love you.

01:41:07.311 --> 01:41:08.729
I love you.

01:41:08.813 --> 01:41:10.689
It was a really good try.

01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:12.149
I'm proud of you all.

01:41:12.233 --> 01:41:14.068
No place I'd rather be
than on this ark

01:41:14.151 --> 01:41:16.778
with all my little animals.

01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:21.867
I wish Roxy was here.

01:41:21.951 --> 01:41:25.037
I'm sorry, sweetie.

01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:27.540
She was a great dog.

01:41:27.623 --> 01:41:29.958
I know I teased you
about her size,

01:41:30.042 --> 01:41:32.836
but she was as brave
<i>as</i> could be.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.839
I bet she gave that bear
a run for his money.

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:37.549
Phoebe,

01:41:37.633 --> 01:41:41.011
even though she's gone,
she'll always be with you.

01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:45.595
I feel like she might be
here right now, watching us.

01:41:46.183 --> 01:41:48.560
She is here.

01:41:48.644 --> 01:41:50.228
Do you feel her too?

01:41:50.313 --> 01:41:52.940
No, she's actually right there.

01:41:53.024 --> 01:41:54.150
Hey, you missing somebody?

01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:58.237
- Roxy! Is she okay?
- Roxy!

01:41:58.321 --> 01:41:59.947
She was pretty scared
when she found me,

01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:02.450
but she's in one piece.

01:42:04.327 --> 01:42:06.370
If someone
had told me a week before

01:42:06.454 --> 01:42:09.457
that I'd soon be floating
in a lake on Noah's ark,

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:13.043
I'd have told them they could
jump in that proverbial lake,

01:42:13.127 --> 01:42:15.963
but when it was real
and happening,

01:42:16.047 --> 01:42:18.924
I didn't wish
I was anywhere else

01:42:19.008 --> 01:42:21.260
because in that moment

01:42:21.344 --> 01:42:23.471
I was exactly where I was
supposed to be

01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:26.014
with the ones
I was supposed to be with.

01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:28.308
Uh-oh.
Whoo!

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:29.684
We spent the rest of camp

01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:33.981
strictly according
to the golden rulebook.

01:42:34.065 --> 01:42:38.565
We sharpened our camp skills,
as best as we could, at least.

01:42:38.778 --> 01:42:40.946
We passed off
all our certifications...

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:44.241
Uh, I think this one's okay.

01:42:44.325 --> 01:42:48.825
Without major incident...

01:42:49.872 --> 01:42:53.458
Yeah, definitely not poisonous.

01:42:55.670 --> 01:43:00.170
Appreciated a lot of nature.

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:03.760
Maybe too much nature.

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:08.765
And had plenty of devotionals.

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:11.893
The parable of the ten virgins
has great meaning in our day.

01:43:11.977 --> 01:43:15.105
Five of your lanterns
have oil, and five do not.

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:18.567
With only minimal distraction.

01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:25.241
Mine has oil.

01:43:25.324 --> 01:43:27.868
I even found
some time to do some journaling,

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:30.955
but you already knew that,

01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:32.789
huh, dad?

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:36.877
Oh, did you wrap
this yourself? It's so cute.

01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:39.088
And even
though I was stressed about it,

01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:43.671
Bree really liked her secret
sister present I made.

01:43:43.926 --> 01:43:47.012
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

01:43:47.096 --> 01:43:48.597
My gift wasn't too bad either.

01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:50.057
Ta-da.

01:43:50.141 --> 01:43:51.809
Led zeppelin was too long, so...

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:56.062
Thank you.

01:43:56.147 --> 01:43:57.427
The last
night they did something

01:43:57.481 --> 01:43:59.024
they call a testimony meeting.

01:43:59.108 --> 01:44:01.527
It sounds like something lawyers
would do before a trial,

01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:03.236
but it's not.

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.031
Basically, anyone who wants to
can get up and share

01:44:06.115 --> 01:44:09.284
their thoughts or feelings about
life, god, or...

01:44:09.368 --> 01:44:10.911
I'd like to-

01:44:10.995 --> 01:44:11.996
whatever they wanted, really.

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:14.247
This is my last summer here.

01:44:14.331 --> 01:44:16.207
You didn't have
to go if you didn't want to,

01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:17.293
only if you felt like it.

01:44:17.376 --> 01:44:19.795
To witness this kind of love...

01:44:19.879 --> 01:44:22.172
It was nice to
hear their different perspectives

01:44:24.008 --> 01:44:26.885
when I could understand them.

01:44:26.969 --> 01:44:29.221
They were sweet,
but for the most part

01:44:29.305 --> 01:44:32.141
it didn't have the same effect
on me like it did the others,

01:44:32.224 --> 01:44:35.644
until Phoebe
had to open her big mouth.

01:44:35.728 --> 01:44:39.815
Y'all know that I'm
a pretty scared person.

01:44:39.899 --> 01:44:43.193
I relate with over 60%
of the phobias on Wikipedia.

01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:45.487
When I'm scared
only a few things

01:44:45.571 --> 01:44:46.947
can actually calm me down,

01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:49.033
like my dad, my mom,

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:51.118
and Roxy.

01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:52.661
I know Roxy's just a dog,

01:44:52.745 --> 01:44:55.622
but she's my best friend.

01:44:55.706 --> 01:45:00.206
When I lost her I was as scared
and sad as I've ever been.

01:45:01.504 --> 01:45:03.422
Then when I saw her again,

01:45:03.506 --> 01:45:07.551
I was so happy, so grateful

01:45:07.635 --> 01:45:12.135
that I forgot how much it hurt
to lose her in the first place.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:16.726
I'm pretty sure
that's how heaven's gonna be.

01:45:16.811 --> 01:45:21.311
Lane, if it hurt this bad
to lose Roxy,

01:45:22.608 --> 01:45:25.569
it must have been
a thousand times worse

01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:27.655
when you lost your dad,

01:45:27.738 --> 01:45:32.238
and I promise you that when you
see him again in heaven,

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:35.495
he will hold you in his arms,

01:45:35.579 --> 01:45:38.206
and all that pain and heartache

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:41.710
will be washed away
in an instant.

01:45:41.794 --> 01:45:45.047
I think Jesus suffered
the worst heartache of all,

01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:47.966
'cause he loved all of us
and wanted to make a way

01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:50.844
for us to be with the ones
we love again.

01:45:50.928 --> 01:45:54.514
I know in my heart

01:45:54.598 --> 01:45:56.933
that god is real,

01:45:57.017 --> 01:45:58.226
that we are his children,

01:45:58.310 --> 01:46:01.187
and he loves us.

01:46:01.272 --> 01:46:03.691
I say this in Jesus' name, amen.

01:46:03.774 --> 01:46:05.400
Amen.

01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:08.612
Thank you, girls,
for sharing your testimonies.

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:11.865
Well, if everyone's gone
that wanted a chance to speak,

01:46:11.949 --> 01:46:15.077
then we'll go ahead
and say the closing prayer.

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.203
Wait.

01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:18.831
Can I say something?

01:46:18.914 --> 01:46:20.749
Of course.

01:46:25.504 --> 01:46:29.174
I just... i want
to thank you all for allowing me

01:46:29.258 --> 01:46:31.969
to be a part of this.

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:33.470
I want to thank
sister Carrington

01:46:33.554 --> 01:46:36.473
for pressuring me into it,

01:46:36.557 --> 01:46:40.561
but seriously, I really,
really needed this.

01:46:40.644 --> 01:46:45.144
I want to thank sister Rockwell
for helping keep me here.

01:46:46.901 --> 01:46:48.903
I was just about ready to
beg you to take me back home

01:46:48.986 --> 01:46:50.237
that day in the sidecar,

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:52.740
but something
about her leather jacket

01:46:52.823 --> 01:46:57.323
and her chaps told me
I should probably ride it out.

01:46:58.203 --> 01:47:02.457
Holly, if your brother
has even half

01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:06.586
of the sincerity and kindness
that you do,

01:47:06.670 --> 01:47:11.170
my mom
is a very, very lucky lady.

01:47:11.467 --> 01:47:15.095
Phoebe, you are so smart.

01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:16.680
You've taught me
more random facts

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:18.766
than I could probably ever
remember in my lifetime,

01:47:18.849 --> 01:47:22.727
but what you said just now

01:47:22.811 --> 01:47:25.980
I will never, ever forget.

01:47:26.065 --> 01:47:28.901
I still don't know
what I believe in

01:47:28.984 --> 01:47:30.443
or if I'm even ready

01:47:30.527 --> 01:47:32.287
to try and figure
all of that out for myself,

01:47:32.321 --> 01:47:36.325
but I want to thank you all for
bringing me closer to a place

01:47:36.408 --> 01:47:37.826
where I can start.

01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:41.705
But if there is one thing
I know for sure,

01:47:41.789 --> 01:47:44.333
it's that there is something
very, very special

01:47:44.416 --> 01:47:48.670
about all of you.

01:47:48.754 --> 01:47:52.174
You're all really,
really good Christians,

01:47:52.257 --> 01:47:54.676
and the world is a better place
because of you.

01:47:58.806 --> 01:47:59.973
Amen?

01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:02.017
Amen.

01:48:08.065 --> 01:48:09.691
Thank you, Lane.

01:48:09.775 --> 01:48:12.068
Now, do I have any volunteers
for a closing prayer?

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:13.820
I'll say it.

01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:16.323
Wait. I know I already went,

01:48:16.407 --> 01:48:20.907
but I just have something else
that I need to say.

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.704
I feel like this past year

01:48:22.788 --> 01:48:25.415
we've really been
struggling as a group, you know?

01:48:25.499 --> 01:48:27.000
We've been cliquish.

01:48:27.084 --> 01:48:30.295
We have been fighting
over the stupidest things

01:48:30.379 --> 01:48:34.879
and just have not been treating
each other the way we should.

01:48:37.469 --> 01:48:40.472
And I feel like
that's mostly my fault.

01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:47.312
Before I came to camp,
I said a prayer,

01:48:47.396 --> 01:48:49.106
and I asked heavenly father

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:52.025
to help me find the strength
as Laurel president

01:48:52.109 --> 01:48:53.819
to be the type of leader

01:48:53.902 --> 01:48:56.696
that I needed to be to help
us come together as a group,

01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:00.116
and I feel like the answer
to that prayer was you, Lane.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:03.703
Your unselfish and loving
example towards Phoebe

01:49:03.787 --> 01:49:07.415
and your acceptance of all of us

01:49:07.499 --> 01:49:11.999
showed me the type of young
woman that I want to be.

01:49:12.504 --> 01:49:15.131
So I appreciate you saying
that we all helped you,

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:18.801
but the truth is

01:49:18.886 --> 01:49:23.386
you helped us
so much more, so thank you.

01:49:23.682 --> 01:49:27.852

01:49:27.936 --> 01:49:29.520

01:49:32.691 --> 01:49:34.401

on the golden schedule,

Instead of complaining about
how old and cheesy

01:50:08.227 --> 01:50:12.564
your camp songs were, I decided
to write a new, cheesy song

01:50:12.648 --> 01:50:14.441
for you guys to learn.
