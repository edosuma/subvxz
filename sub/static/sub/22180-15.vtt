00:02.074 --> 00:03.808
Dalton! Dalton! Dalton!

00:06.345 --> 00:09.748
Dalton! Dalton! Dalton!

00:09.749 --> 00:11.183
Thank you.

00:11.184 --> 00:15.521
You know, I once had a
basketball coach who said,

00:15.522 --> 00:17.390
"You want to win,
get the ball in the hoop."

00:17.391 --> 00:19.392
I'd...

00:19.393 --> 00:21.527
like to say the season I spent
as the starting forward

00:21.528 --> 00:24.063
for the Hamilton High
Tigers was a winning one,

00:24.064 --> 00:29.168
but, I'm afraid wewe didn't
get enough balls in hoops.

00:29.169 --> 00:31.571
But that season, I found something

00:31.572 --> 00:33.072
I didn't know I'd been looking for.

00:33.073 --> 00:36.643
That feeling of coming together
with a group of people

00:36.644 --> 00:38.611
who had your back.

00:38.612 --> 00:41.981
All of us trying to bring
out the best in each other.

00:41.982 --> 00:47.053
I, can see now that my
journey to public service

00:47.054 --> 00:51.958
began with that failed season
on the Hamilton Tigers.

00:53.360 --> 00:58.131
Now, though my season in
politics may be ending...

01:00.234 --> 01:04.337
my journey in public
service never will.

01:04.337 --> 01:07.340
Nor should it for any of you.

01:07.341 --> 01:10.009
So let's all keep
fighting for a strong,

01:10.010 --> 01:13.880
prosperous and secure California
for generations to come.

01:13.881 --> 01:17.750
It's been an honor, truly.

01:17.751 --> 01:20.420
God bless the great
state of California.

01:20.421 --> 01:21.954
And God bless all of you.

01:21.955 --> 01:23.990
Thank you.

01:23.991 --> 01:26.259
Dalton! Dalton!

01:26.260 --> 01:29.362
Dalton! Dalton! Dalton!

01:29.363 --> 01:34.667
Dalton! Dalton! Dalton!

01:34.668 --> 01:36.135
- You have my vote, sir.
- Thank you. Thanks for being here.

01:36.136 --> 01:37.804
Keep fighting. Appreciate it.

01:37.805 --> 01:40.006
Ben. Sorry to break
your winning streak.

01:40.007 --> 01:42.141
Yeah, should've had this one, Conrad.

01:42.142 --> 01:44.811
Well, you ran a crack team.

01:44.812 --> 01:47.013
Already off to the next rodeo?

01:47.014 --> 01:49.215
Delaware house seat special election.

01:49.216 --> 01:50.650
He's not half the candidate you are,

01:50.651 --> 01:53.353
but if he manages to not skip
the debate at the last minute,

01:53.354 --> 01:56.289
we might have a shot.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.257
Go get 'em.

01:58.258 --> 02:00.860
You, too.

02:00.861 --> 02:03.096
All righty, Mr. President.

02:03.097 --> 02:05.598
Hope you're not too nervous
for the big final exam.

02:05.599 --> 02:07.667
My colleagues are
starting to fight over

02:07.668 --> 02:10.370
who deserves credit for
your amazing recovery.

02:10.371 --> 02:12.038
I'm sure you'll pass
with flying colors.

02:13.374 --> 02:15.241
And here comes Russell,
to make sure I don't cheat.

02:15.242 --> 02:16.409
I can come back later.

02:16.410 --> 02:17.543
Stay.

02:17.544 --> 02:18.711
He's good with an audience.
Something about

02:18.712 --> 02:20.046
being the leader of the free world.

02:20.047 --> 02:22.715
Soon to be.

02:22.716 --> 02:24.684
If all goes well.

02:24.685 --> 02:25.952
No pressure.

02:25.953 --> 02:27.787
I'm gonna say five
words, and I want you

02:27.788 --> 02:29.155
to repeat them back to me.

02:29.156 --> 02:32.492
"Baby, monkey, glass, sunset, iron."

02:32.493 --> 02:34.861
"Baby, monkey, glass, sunset, iron."

02:34.862 --> 02:36.162
Good. Now, backwards?

02:36.163 --> 02:39.197
"Iron, sunset, glass, monkey, baby."

02:42.002 --> 02:43.302
Well done, sir.

02:43.303 --> 02:45.304
Not sure I could remember all that.

02:45.305 --> 02:48.674
I'm firing on all ganglia,
so I'm told.

02:48.675 --> 02:50.843
Once we, get the official results,

02:50.844 --> 02:52.912
we'll just need you to
sign a letter to Congress,

02:52.913 --> 02:55.114
ending your temporary medical leave,

02:55.115 --> 02:57.116
and we're good to go.

02:57.117 --> 03:00.420
I'll be happy to get back
to security briefings.

03:00.421 --> 03:02.121
Why does anyone watch cable news?

03:03.223 --> 03:05.458
First order of business
will be a ceremony

03:05.459 --> 03:07.460
to present the Presidential
Medal of Freedom

03:07.461 --> 03:09.862
to the newly elected
president of Myanmar.

03:09.863 --> 03:11.731
U Khaing.

03:11.732 --> 03:13.099
Ten years in prison, and now

03:13.100 --> 03:15.234
he's their first
democraticallyelected president

03:15.235 --> 03:16.702
in over 50 years.

03:16.703 --> 03:17.770
Yeah.

03:17.771 --> 03:19.439
Very popular on cable news.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.208
Well, the ceremony will
generate a lot of coverage.

03:22.209 --> 03:24.610
It'll be a fitting welcome...
and welcome back...

03:24.611 --> 03:28.848
to two valued leaders of democracy.

03:28.849 --> 03:32.117
Well, let's see how
the tests come out.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.192
- Morning.
- Hey.

03:39.193 --> 03:40.960
Do you have time for a muffin?

03:40.961 --> 03:42.962
What life would I be living

03:42.963 --> 03:44.997
if I didn't have time for a muffin?

03:44.998 --> 03:47.033
Not your best one.

03:47.034 --> 03:48.601
Hey, you were up late last night.

03:48.602 --> 03:50.136
Yeah, I have an antiquities final.

03:50.137 --> 03:52.138
I'm seeing togas in my sleep.

03:52.139 --> 03:53.706
I'll pick you up at the
train station, Maureen.

03:53.707 --> 03:54.674
It's not a big deal.

03:54.675 --> 03:56.342
Aunt Maureen is coming?

03:56.343 --> 03:57.977
Why don't you say that louder?
I don't think she heard you.

03:57.978 --> 03:59.879
- Sorry, I just didn't know.
- Okay. Bye.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.514
Yeah, it was kind of
a lastminute idea.

04:01.515 --> 04:03.131
There's an art exhibit in
town she wants to see.

04:03.132 --> 04:04.565
Aunt Maureen wants to
see an art exhibit?

04:04.566 --> 04:05.513
Hey.

04:05.514 --> 04:07.720
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm just surprised.

04:07.721 --> 04:09.055
- What is it?
- Renoir.

04:09.056 --> 04:10.195
- Well, that makes sense.
- Okay.

04:10.196 --> 04:11.285
You know what?

04:11.286 --> 04:12.925
- That is total elitism.
- You know, one year of art school,

04:12.926 --> 04:13.926
- and you're all, like...
- It is.

04:13.927 --> 04:15.620
I'm not being an elitist.

04:15.621 --> 04:18.557
It's just all of those rosy
cheeks and flowery fields

04:18.558 --> 04:21.495
- and little fluffy dogs.
- Now I just want to go with you.

04:21.495 --> 04:25.466
But I can't, because the
second most important visitor

04:25.467 --> 04:28.269
is landing in D.C. in
less than an hour.

04:28.270 --> 04:29.770
The new Burmese president.

04:29.771 --> 04:31.005
Yeah. U Khaing.

04:31.006 --> 04:32.206
That guy is so cool.

04:32.207 --> 04:33.874
He's like the Nelson
Mandela of Myanmar.

04:33.875 --> 04:34.976
Only, dreamy.

04:34.977 --> 04:37.378
Okay, the Dalai Lama
passed through town,

04:37.379 --> 04:38.980
and you didn't even look
up from your phone.

04:38.981 --> 04:40.448
And now we know why. Okay, bye.

04:40.449 --> 04:41.549
Hey, dinner.

04:41.550 --> 04:43.317
You know how Maureen is about takeout.

04:43.318 --> 04:44.652
Yes, yes, I will definitely
be here for dinner.

04:44.653 --> 04:46.120
- Yeah.
- Don't say "definitely."

04:46.121 --> 04:47.989
Don't say... you're gonna curse it.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.024
"Endeavor," then. I will
endeavor... ggoodbye.

04:50.025 --> 04:50.958
Okay, that's better.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.663
- Okay? Good luck.
- Okay, bye.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.074

05:16.451 --> 05:18.219
Welcome, President Khaing.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.920
It is a tremendous honor,

05:19.921 --> 05:20.921
Madam President.

05:20.922 --> 05:22.923
President Dalton sends his regards.

05:22.924 --> 05:24.659
I'm keeping the seat warm.

05:25.694 --> 05:27.261
We love you!

05:27.262 --> 05:29.330
Mr. President.

05:29.331 --> 05:31.632
I didn't realize you
were the fifth Beatle.

05:31.633 --> 05:33.167
Don't tell Yoko.

05:33.168 --> 05:34.368
Come, please.

05:34.369 --> 05:36.470
- Okay.
- Just look at that.

05:36.471 --> 05:37.938
This guy's been in
prison for ten years,

05:37.939 --> 05:39.140
and now he's president.

05:39.141 --> 05:41.375
Well, house arrest.
It's not exactly prison.

05:43.578 --> 05:45.346
- It's different.
- It's not like he had Netflix.

05:45.347 --> 05:47.481
He was free to leave
Myanmar at any time.

05:47.482 --> 05:49.417
He said as long as his
people were imprisoned

05:49.418 --> 05:52.520
under military dictatorship,
he'd stay in prison with them.

05:54.356 --> 05:55.589
That's hot.

05:55.590 --> 05:56.590
Right?

05:58.260 --> 06:00.628
Guess I'm gonna die alone.

06:00.629 --> 06:02.663
During the years of my imprisonment,

06:02.664 --> 06:04.965
three things gave me comfort:

06:04.966 --> 06:06.233
My cat Sanda...

06:06.234 --> 06:08.436
the note sometimes left for me

06:08.437 --> 06:09.937
at great risk in my garden wall

06:09.938 --> 06:12.440
by my Burmese brothers and sisters,

06:12.441 --> 06:14.775
and my old copy of
Democracy in America

06:14.776 --> 06:16.777
by Alexis de Tocqueville.

06:16.778 --> 06:19.747
Being French, I'm afraid he
found your great experiment

06:19.748 --> 06:22.750
full of weaknesses and failures.

06:22.751 --> 06:25.252
But he always came back to hope.

06:25.253 --> 06:28.356
America, you have been
the beacon of hope

06:28.357 --> 06:30.257
to a small Asian nation

06:30.258 --> 06:32.660
struggling in the darkness of tyranny

06:32.661 --> 06:34.562
for most of its independence.

06:34.563 --> 06:38.999
I come to you, a pilgrim,
offering one small light to add

06:39.000 --> 06:41.935
to your great torch of freedom.

06:46.007 --> 06:47.274
He doesn't have a speechwriter.

06:47.275 --> 06:48.676
That's all him.

06:48.677 --> 06:49.844
Okay, don't rub it in.

06:49.845 --> 06:51.511
Ooh...

06:56.017 --> 06:57.184
Russell.

06:57.185 --> 06:58.586
I just got the message.

06:58.587 --> 06:59.720
Everything okay?

06:59.721 --> 07:00.755
He's fine.

07:00.756 --> 07:02.723
He just needs to take a beat.

07:02.724 --> 07:03.858
Well, how long is a beat?

07:03.859 --> 07:05.126
The attorney general is waiting,

07:05.127 --> 07:07.495
right now, with a letter
to sign for Congress.

07:07.496 --> 07:09.597
He wants to make sure he's ready.

07:09.598 --> 07:10.765
What are we talking here?

07:10.766 --> 07:12.299
Another day?

07:12.300 --> 07:14.101
Some time to think?

07:14.102 --> 07:16.203
I don't want to be the
last to know, Russell.

07:16.204 --> 07:18.305
If I had my run, I want to admit it.

07:19.508 --> 07:22.777
Sir, a team of the best
neurologists in the country.

07:22.778 --> 07:26.313
You're fully
capable of resuming your duty.

07:26.314 --> 07:29.116
They also said the effects
could be ongoing.

07:29.117 --> 07:32.486
Which we will monitor,
address, if necessary.

07:32.487 --> 07:34.455
I know you, sir.

07:34.456 --> 07:37.190
Once you get your legs
under you, you'll be fine.

07:38.994 --> 07:41.728
We've been here before.

07:43.532 --> 07:45.832
I need some time.

07:48.804 --> 07:52.773
We can, we can push it a day.

07:52.774 --> 07:56.277
He'll take the time he needs, Russell.

07:58.914 --> 08:00.380
Okay.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.632
- Welcome back, ma'am.
- Morning.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.422
- Ma'am.
- I can guess what this is about.

08:22.423 --> 08:24.190
Press is all over me
about Dalton refusing

08:24.191 --> 08:25.358
to return to office.

08:25.359 --> 08:27.894
The president is spending
a few days at Camp David

08:27.895 --> 08:29.095
with the first lady.

08:29.096 --> 08:30.497
Who said he's refusing?

08:30.498 --> 08:31.631
Ils it a health concern?

08:31.632 --> 08:32.732
This is just me asking.

08:32.732 --> 08:34.134
Also, the whole country.

08:34.135 --> 08:37.303
The president has a perfectly
clean bill of health,

08:37.304 --> 08:40.073
but he has also just had
major brain surgery,

08:40.073 --> 08:41.707
so he wants to make sure
that he's fully recovered

08:41.708 --> 08:45.211
before he takes over the
toughest job on the planet.

08:45.212 --> 08:46.546
Where's Jay?

08:46.547 --> 08:47.781
There's a childcare issue.

08:47.782 --> 08:49.783
He said "ten minutes, tops,"
but iit's a half hour.

08:49.784 --> 08:51.184
I moved the morning meeting.

08:51.185 --> 08:54.020
Ma'am, I have some news that
probably shouldn't wait.

08:54.021 --> 08:56.523
We're getting reports from
UNICEF that a massive number

08:56.524 --> 08:59.125
of Rohingya... Myanmar's
Muslim population...

08:59.126 --> 09:01.995
are flooding across the
border into Bangladesh.

09:01.996 --> 09:03.496
- When did that start?
- Well,

09:03.497 --> 09:05.665
from what UNICEF's hearing,
the Rohingya are fleeing

09:05.666 --> 09:07.400
some kind of violence that
started two days ago.

09:07.401 --> 09:09.135
How many refugees?
Do we have an estimate?

09:09.136 --> 09:11.738
Well, enough for Bangladesh to
call for emergency assistance.

09:11.739 --> 09:13.973
They're already overpopulated
with not a lot of resources,

09:13.974 --> 09:16.075
but the estimates are

09:16.076 --> 09:17.744
in the hundreds of
thousands and growing.

09:17.745 --> 09:19.212
Let's reach out to the U.N...

09:19.213 --> 09:22.015
has President Khaing said
anything about this?

09:22.016 --> 09:23.450
Not that I've seen.

09:23.451 --> 09:25.084
- Blake.
- I'll set up a meeting.

09:25.085 --> 09:27.153
- As soon as possible.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:27.154 --> 09:29.422
There's a history of ethnic
tension in the region.

09:29.423 --> 09:32.792
Maybe the military can
get it under control.

09:32.793 --> 09:34.594
Unless it's the military
perpetrating the, violence.

09:34.595 --> 09:37.497
There was an attack a few weeks
ago by a Muslim separatist group

09:37.498 --> 09:39.098
on some Burmese police.

09:39.099 --> 09:40.099
This could be retaliation.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.501
A state crackdown leading

09:41.502 --> 09:44.737
to a mass exodus would
be extremely troubling.

09:44.738 --> 09:45.905
Particularly

09:45.906 --> 09:47.373
when we're about to
present their first

09:47.374 --> 09:49.374
democraticallyelected
leader the Medal of Freedom.

09:50.744 --> 09:52.268
I mean, somebody has to
think about the optics.

09:52.269 --> 09:54.247
- Yeah.
- Hey. Party in here.

09:54.248 --> 09:56.015
Muslims fleeing Myanmar,

09:56.016 --> 09:59.118
humanitarian crisis,
possible ethnic cleansing.

09:59.119 --> 10:02.856
Hold on. We don't know enough
to call it "ethnic cleansing."

10:02.857 --> 10:06.059
Except the Rohingya
have kind of been living

10:06.060 --> 10:08.328
in apartheidlike
conditions for generations.

10:08.329 --> 10:10.163
They were rounded up and put in camps

10:10.164 --> 10:11.664
as recently as... what was it... 2012?

10:11.665 --> 10:12.899
It's a country

10:12.900 --> 10:14.968
at a crossroads;
They're part democracy,

10:14.969 --> 10:17.003
part military dictatorship.

10:17.004 --> 10:20.773
They're still trying to come to
terms with their colonial past,

10:20.774 --> 10:22.108
building a new economy...

10:22.109 --> 10:26.012
We... we have to help them
go the right way here.

10:26.013 --> 10:28.648
I just want to know when it's
Myanmar and when it's Burma.

10:28.649 --> 10:29.983
Well, officially, it's Myanmar,

10:29.984 --> 10:32.719
but the country still keeps
the old colonial name.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.488
And the old colonial borders,
which is why the Buddhists feel

10:35.489 --> 10:38.157
that the Muslim Rohingya should
have ended up in Bangladesh.

10:38.158 --> 10:40.660
President Khaing is leading a prayer

10:40.661 --> 10:42.662
at the Great River Buddhist temple,

10:42.663 --> 10:44.430
then I'm told he's booked
for the rest of the day.

10:44.431 --> 10:47.666
Well, then, I guess we're
about to go pray. Shall we?

10:49.637 --> 10:51.437
President Khaing?

10:51.438 --> 10:52.739
I'm so sorry.

10:52.740 --> 10:55.875
So good to see you again,
Madam Secretary.

10:55.876 --> 10:57.443
We're just about to begin.

10:57.444 --> 10:58.478
We're not actually gonna stay.

10:58.479 --> 11:00.313
This is my policy advisor,
Kat Sandoval.

11:00.314 --> 11:02.882
- Mr. President.
- .

11:02.883 --> 11:05.451
If we could just have a moment

11:05.452 --> 11:07.586
- of your time.
- Of course.

11:09.356 --> 11:12.992
We've had numerous reports
of your Rohingya people

11:12.993 --> 11:15.194
fleeing some kind of
violence in your country.

11:15.195 --> 11:19.699
And we just wanted to offer
whatever support we can

11:19.700 --> 11:21.701
to help you address this crisis.

11:21.702 --> 11:24.404
What kind of reports?

11:24.405 --> 11:26.973
- Well...
- Refugee camps in Bangladesh

11:26.974 --> 11:29.309
are being overwhelmed
by the Rohingya people.

11:29.310 --> 11:31.878
Adults, as well as children,

11:31.879 --> 11:33.646
are saying that they're
being driven out.

11:33.647 --> 11:35.748
Great trouble with the Bengali.

11:35.749 --> 11:37.050
It is both new

11:37.051 --> 11:39.052
and goes back to the very
beginning of our country.

11:39.053 --> 11:42.055
But the United States has its
own immigration troubles.

11:42.056 --> 11:43.489
I'm sure you can understand.

11:43.490 --> 11:45.491
Well, I'm not sure it's
an immigration issue,

11:45.492 --> 11:47.994
when these people have lived
in the Rikhine State for...

11:47.995 --> 11:49.095
generations.

11:49.096 --> 11:52.532
But, right now, we're just trying

11:52.533 --> 11:54.834
to understand what
exactly is happening.

11:54.835 --> 11:56.536
As always with these matters,

11:56.537 --> 11:57.637
it's very complicated.

11:57.638 --> 12:00.039
There was recently a violent attack

12:00.040 --> 12:03.276
by an Islamic insurgency against
out Burmese police forces.

12:03.277 --> 12:05.812
Perhaps the fear of retaliation
prompted the sudden migrat...

12:05.813 --> 12:07.413
What we're hearing, Mr. President,

12:07.414 --> 12:09.215
are confirmed reports
of ongoing violence.

12:09.216 --> 12:12.485
Specifically targeting
the Rohingya people.

12:12.486 --> 12:14.621
We prefer to call these
people the Muslims

12:14.622 --> 12:16.522
of the Rikhine State.

12:16.523 --> 12:18.391
I'll confer with my advisors

12:18.392 --> 12:21.560
on this matter and we'll
talk again when I know more.

12:22.563 --> 12:25.063
- Thank you for your concern.
- Of course.

12:27.868 --> 12:29.469
Why won't he call them Rohingya?

12:29.470 --> 12:30.937
And since when is a refugee crisis

12:30.938 --> 12:32.305
a spontaneous selfdeportation?

12:32.306 --> 12:33.673
I hate to say it, but I cannot believe

12:33.674 --> 12:34.874
this is the guy we're honoring.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.735
We need to figure out
what's really going on.

12:38.479 --> 12:40.113
Hi.

12:40.114 --> 12:41.614
There she is.

12:41.615 --> 12:43.750
- Hey, Aunt Maureen.
- Come here, you.

12:45.319 --> 12:47.053
The best therapy in
the world right here.

12:47.054 --> 12:49.467
- So great to see you.
- Look at you, so beautiful.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.035
- Where's Jace?
- He's at Piper's.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.004
He promised he'll be back for dinner.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.906
Who's this Piper I keep hearing about?

12:54.907 --> 12:57.642
She's, like, the female Jace,
only actually cool.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.545
You want a cup of tea, Mo?

13:00.546 --> 13:02.413
Sure, I'll have,
something herbal.

13:02.414 --> 13:06.751
I got you a little something.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.219
You didn't have to do that.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.255
I told the guy at the art store

13:10.256 --> 13:12.390
that my niece was a
professional designer.

13:12.391 --> 13:15.026
Hopefully someday.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.928
These are great.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.530
You sure?

13:18.531 --> 13:20.131
The guy wasn't taking me for a ride?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.867
No, they're perfect.
Thank you so much.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.370
I wish your
grandfather could see you

13:25.371 --> 13:26.804
making your own clothes,
so professional.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.208
He would've crushed that
dream right out of you.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.576
Stop it. He would not.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.812
Why don't I show you some of
the stuff I'm working on?

13:32.813 --> 13:34.347
- That'd be great.
- Here you go.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.048
Thanks.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.917
- I got something for you, too.
- What is it, Christmas?

13:37.918 --> 13:39.384
I just found it in a drawer.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.688
Dad's old knife.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.724
He had it all the time, remember?

13:44.725 --> 13:45.858
There's a little release right here.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.426
Yeah, I know how to...

13:47.427 --> 13:49.428
Almost forgot about this.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.163
I know he would have
wanted you to have it.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.832
- Don't tell Shane.
- Listen,

13:52.833 --> 13:54.500
I just got a text from Elizabeth.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.973
She's really sorry, but she is not
gonna make it home for dinner tonight.

13:56.974 --> 13:58.671
- Called it.
- What a shame.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.339
And I was even making
her favorite chicken

14:00.340 --> 14:01.307
with mushroom sauce.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.375
She really wanted to welcome you.

14:02.376 --> 14:03.476
Well, let's do it tomorrow night,

14:03.477 --> 14:04.477
when we can all be together.

14:04.478 --> 14:05.845
I mean, I don't need a red carpet.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.346
Why don't we order in?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.981
Really?

14:08.982 --> 14:10.850
What are we in the mood for?

14:10.851 --> 14:12.218
We like Thai.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.486
Thai sounds great.

14:13.487 --> 14:16.188
- I'll get a menu.
- Great.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.523
All right, well, listen,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.492
- I'll get your bag upstairs.
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:19.493 --> 14:20.760
- I'll take, take care of it, no problem.
- You sure?

14:20.761 --> 14:22.261
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Okay. Second door on the left.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.598
All right, well, it's
good to see you, brother.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.201
You, too.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.935
Sure.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.608
Donna! Donna, hey.

14:35.609 --> 14:36.709
I saw your email.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.040
I am late for a department meeting.
Can we talk after?

14:39.041 --> 14:40.379
Okay, okay, well, did you
actually read my email?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.647
'Cause I'm pretty sure a massacre

14:41.648 --> 14:43.583
takes precedence over
a department meeting.

14:43.584 --> 14:45.450
Unless I'm missing something.

14:48.121 --> 14:51.857
We're looking at a humanitarian
crisis in Myanmar.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.260
President Khaing still
hasn't released a statement.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.062
Of course, he won't say the name
of the people being slaughtered.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.437
Rohingya is a contested term.
The Buddhist majority...

14:58.438 --> 14:59.298
Yes.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.300
See the Muslim minority
as illegal immigrants

15:01.301 --> 15:02.902
from Bangladesh, so
they prefer "Bengali."

15:02.903 --> 15:05.304
Our newly elected
humanitarian icon seems to be

15:05.305 --> 15:06.939
turning a blind eye
to ethnic cleansing.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.075
President Khaing is avoiding
taking sides because he can't.

15:09.076 --> 15:12.178
That's a little hard to swallow
when we're about to present him

15:12.179 --> 15:13.846
with the Presidential
Medal of Freedom.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.381
But you know what? We will table that.

15:15.382 --> 15:19.585
Right now I need a full report
on military and police activity

15:19.586 --> 15:20.886
in the Rikhine State of Myanmar over

15:20.887 --> 15:23.022
the last year and a detailed
record of the last week.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.523
- I'll pull together what we have...
- Great.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.826
But there isn't much.

15:26.827 --> 15:29.996
Donna, can I ask why I
have NGOs on the ground

15:29.997 --> 15:32.365
giving me more information
than our own East Asia desk?

15:32.366 --> 15:34.834
Because operating on an
official level with Myanmar

15:34.835 --> 15:36.435
right now is complex.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.070
Well, it's al... it's always complex.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.105
What? It's diplomacy.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.439
What are we talking about here?

15:40.440 --> 15:43.009
I'm going to say something
that may sound impertinent,

15:43.010 --> 15:44.944
but for President Khaing's sake,

15:44.945 --> 15:48.080
I respectfully request
that we not look further

15:48.081 --> 15:50.483
into the actions of the
Burmese military right now.

15:50.484 --> 15:52.585
Agreed on the impertinent part.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.253
Why?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.422
The election of President
Khaing is nothing short

15:56.423 --> 15:58.457
of a political miracle
in Southeast Asia.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.694
But it only happened
because General Bo Htun

16:01.695 --> 16:04.063
agreed to let his country's
most famous dissident

16:04.064 --> 16:06.999
have a small measure of
power as long as Bo Htun

16:07.000 --> 16:09.268
kept most control for himself.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.637
If State starts throwing its
weight around too soon,

16:11.638 --> 16:14.306
we risk undermining Khaing
at a crucial moment

16:14.307 --> 16:15.608
in his presidency.

16:15.609 --> 16:20.311
To put it more bluntly,
this is his fight, not ours.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.383
I'll let you get to your meeting.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.021
We have a situation.

16:29.022 --> 16:32.191
We now have an estimate
of more than 100,000.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.226
Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.729
And the newly elected
president is denying

16:36.730 --> 16:38.764
that any violence took place;

16:38.765 --> 16:41.033
My own people are telling
us to leave it alone,

16:41.034 --> 16:42.635
and the whole thing
is going to blow up

16:42.636 --> 16:44.203
into an international story.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.172
Just as Conrad is about to
present their president

16:46.173 --> 16:48.207
with our highest honor.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.610
Well, my greater concern is
another situation like Bosnia

16:51.611 --> 16:53.546
or Rwanda, when the world stood by

16:53.547 --> 16:55.147
while a massacre went unchecked.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.316
- Where's the U.N. on this?
- Well,

16:57.317 --> 16:59.218
we're all trying to
confirm whether this was

16:59.219 --> 17:00.453
a stateordered crackdown

17:00.454 --> 17:02.588
of some kind or violence
between vigilante groups.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.958
Once we know what's happening,
then we can talk interventions.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.292
I can reach out

17:07.294 --> 17:08.961
to the supreme commander
of the Burmese Army,

17:08.962 --> 17:10.930
but if the president
isn't willing to talk...

17:10.931 --> 17:13.265
I'm proposing military
drone surveillance.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.367
- Violating their airspace?
- If they're not willing

17:15.367 --> 17:17.603
to tell us what's going on,
then we have to find out

17:17.604 --> 17:19.704
- for ourselves.
- Well, it's a provocative move

17:19.705 --> 17:21.040
so soon into Khaing's first term.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.843
China won't be happy.

17:23.844 --> 17:25.877
Conrad is back in office in two days.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.012
I say it's his call.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.315
Might be best not to wait.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.317
Meaning what?

17:31.318 --> 17:33.886
The situation's evolving.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.855
Precisely why I think

17:35.856 --> 17:37.957
Dalton should be the one to decide

17:37.958 --> 17:40.092
about committing our military assets.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.161
Not that situation.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.762
Is he all right?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.200
There's no health issue.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.136
That's all I can say right now.

17:50.137 --> 17:54.172
You should make the call on Myanmar.

17:58.979 --> 18:01.546
Order the surveillance.

18:13.985 --> 18:18.751
So, are we still gonna
be here next week?

18:18.752 --> 18:21.987
I can't say yet.

18:21.988 --> 18:25.257
I think once you get back
in the swing of things...

18:25.258 --> 18:28.194
The presidency doesn't "swing."

18:28.195 --> 18:30.196
It comes at you, every minute.

18:30.197 --> 18:31.330
Dr. Hubbard says you're ready.

18:31.331 --> 18:33.331
Dr. Hubbard isn't in my head.

18:35.835 --> 18:38.337
She also couldn't rule out
the chance of a recurrence.

18:38.338 --> 18:41.607
A very small chance.

18:41.608 --> 18:45.844
Not much bigger than
anyone else's chance.

18:45.845 --> 18:50.416
Look, you'll do what you always do.

18:50.417 --> 18:53.219
Consider the facts,

18:53.220 --> 18:56.989
then trust your instincts.

18:56.990 --> 18:59.290
Yeah.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.529
Good evening from McClendon
University in Sacramento.

19:03.530 --> 19:05.698
-
- Tonight in the race for governor,

19:05.699 --> 19:10.106
we present the only debate
between our two candidates,

19:10.107 --> 19:13.142
former Director of the
Central Intelligence Agency,

19:13.143 --> 19:15.811
Conrad Dalton and incumbent Jack Dunn.

19:18.415 --> 19:20.817
Good evening, California.

19:20.818 --> 19:22.185
I'm Daffy Duck.

19:22.186 --> 19:23.753
And you're despicable.

19:23.754 --> 19:26.522
Quack, quack, quack.

19:26.523 --> 19:28.891
So, I guess I'm Bugs Bunny.

19:30.527 --> 19:31.594
Are we good?

19:31.595 --> 19:32.695
Yep, we're good out here.

19:32.696 --> 19:34.230
Can you bring Mr.
Dalton's key light down

19:34.231 --> 19:36.051
about two percent, please?

19:42.740 --> 19:45.241
Hey, we're just,
finishing sound check.

19:45.242 --> 19:47.008
You almost here?

19:52.750 --> 19:53.983
I want the flags...

19:53.984 --> 19:56.419
He gave them my name?

19:56.420 --> 19:59.088
Are you sure?

19:59.089 --> 20:01.323
When was this?

20:06.096 --> 20:08.464
Tell them I'll be there
as soon as I can.

20:08.465 --> 20:11.633
Yeah. Love you. Bye.

20:15.038 --> 20:17.240
- Hey, Ben.
- One sec, we're almost done.

20:17.241 --> 20:20.443
Ben.

20:20.444 --> 20:24.947
I, I need to get to Los Angeles.

20:24.948 --> 20:27.784
Absolutely, we'll,
we'll get you a ride tonight.

20:27.785 --> 20:29.619
I need to go now.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.921
The debate starts in two hours.

20:31.922 --> 20:33.989
It's an emergency situation.

20:39.096 --> 20:40.463
What's going on?

20:40.464 --> 20:42.365
I can't really get into it.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.267
I'm sorry to ask,
but is someone dying?

20:44.268 --> 20:47.136
- No, no, nothing like that.
- Good.

20:47.137 --> 20:51.073
'Cause unless someone
is dying right now,

20:51.074 --> 20:53.342
you can't miss this debate. You can't.

20:53.343 --> 20:55.344
I'm afraid I have to go.

20:55.345 --> 20:57.814
So you're forfeiting
the entire campaign

20:57.815 --> 21:00.349
and you can't even
give me a reason why?

21:00.350 --> 21:01.484
I don't have a choice.

21:01.485 --> 21:03.219
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.054
Then this is what I'm choosing.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.190
I'm sorry, Ben.

21:07.191 --> 21:09.991
I'm sorry, everybody.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.095
I'll call you from the road.

21:13.096 --> 21:14.230
Great.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.966
We'll, we'll figure it out.

21:16.967 --> 21:18.967
Nothing to figure out.

21:30.547 --> 21:33.015
Your brother was brought
in around 4:10 today

21:33.016 --> 21:35.651
with multiple fractures to
his left forearm and wrist

21:35.652 --> 21:37.420
and severe facial contusions.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.889
The social worker said there
was a violent altercation

21:39.890 --> 21:41.257
at the men's shelter.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.860
He also seemed to be
experiencing delusions,

21:43.861 --> 21:45.928
possibly due to alcohol withdrawal.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.564
He's schizoaffective.

21:48.565 --> 21:49.966
Depressive type.

21:49.967 --> 21:51.634
Must be going through an episode.

21:51.635 --> 21:52.869
Okay.

21:52.870 --> 21:55.771
So, you've not been in
touch with your brother?

21:55.772 --> 21:58.674
He disappeared from a
psychiatric hospital

21:58.675 --> 22:01.244
in Connecticut three years ago.

22:01.245 --> 22:03.913
Hutton Presbyterian.

22:03.914 --> 22:06.549
The family's been looking
for him every day.

22:06.550 --> 22:08.551
We'll reach out to
Hutton for his records.

22:08.552 --> 22:10.253
Right now we have him
on a benzodiazepine

22:10.254 --> 22:11.554
to calm the delusions.

22:11.555 --> 22:13.289
You're gonna want to
get him on an SSRI.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.992
- That worked for a time.
- Okay.

22:15.993 --> 22:18.094
Thank you, Dr. Guskin.

22:18.095 --> 22:19.795
It's good he reached out to you.

22:19.796 --> 22:22.097
Yeah.

22:25.035 --> 22:26.402
Maybe I'll look into a hotel room.

22:26.403 --> 22:29.872
It's wait and see at this point.

22:29.873 --> 22:31.774
Lydia, I'll call you back.

22:31.775 --> 22:35.077
Yeah. Love you.

22:35.078 --> 22:37.613
John. Hey.

22:37.614 --> 22:40.349
It's me.

22:40.350 --> 22:42.351
What are you doing here?

22:42.352 --> 22:45.421
Well, they said you gave them my name.

22:45.422 --> 22:49.358
I must've been out of my mind.

22:51.261 --> 22:53.796
It's good to see you.

22:53.797 --> 22:56.564
You look like hell.

22:58.268 --> 22:59.868
Want a drink of water?

23:14.751 --> 23:17.653
Where the hell you been, you dumb-ass?

23:17.654 --> 23:20.088
Gone.

23:21.825 --> 23:24.126
Well, you're back now.

23:24.127 --> 23:26.694
I got you.

23:29.232 --> 23:31.500
Wasn't that beautiful?

23:31.501 --> 23:33.436
I felt like I just spent
the morning in Paris.

23:33.437 --> 23:37.106
Please. It was like one long
celebration of the bourgeoisie

23:37.107 --> 23:38.507
and now we have an endless array

23:38.508 --> 23:40.609
of tchotchkes to prove it.

23:42.479 --> 23:44.146
You think Erin would like this scarf?

23:44.147 --> 23:45.314
I don't know.

23:45.315 --> 23:47.883
She's probably not bourgeois enough.

23:47.884 --> 23:50.319
There's nothing more unbearable
than a college freshman.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.822
I wouldn't know much
about that, would I?

23:52.823 --> 23:53.789
I'm starving.

23:53.790 --> 23:55.157
Could we go get something to eat?

23:55.158 --> 23:56.225
Just come here a minute.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.893
You know, you know,

23:57.894 --> 23:58.995
Maureen's been looking
forward to this.

23:58.996 --> 24:00.463
She doesn't get a lot
of fun in her life.

24:00.464 --> 24:01.597
Who's stopping her from having fun?

24:01.598 --> 24:02.665
I was just stating my opinion.

24:02.666 --> 24:04.867
Look, I know that it
seems sophisticated

24:04.868 --> 24:07.136
to cut everything down,
but the actual sign

24:07.137 --> 24:09.605
of a fine mind is the
ability to engage

24:09.606 --> 24:12.074
in a broad spectrum of
culture without judging it.

24:12.075 --> 24:13.609
And by the way,

24:13.610 --> 24:17.680
Renoir is not just a celebration
of the bourgeoisie.

24:17.681 --> 24:20.383
Sorry for being unsophisticated.

24:20.384 --> 24:22.551
Should I go apologize?

24:22.552 --> 24:23.886
Just...

24:23.887 --> 24:25.521
take a little time and
get to know your aunt.

24:25.522 --> 24:27.056
She's a sharp lady.
Ask her a question.

24:27.057 --> 24:29.325
You might learn something.

24:30.961 --> 24:33.629
Ma'am, I am so sorry to interrupt,

24:33.630 --> 24:35.064
but we just got the report back

24:35.065 --> 24:37.166
from the military
surveillance over Myanmar.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.800
It is not good.

24:41.638 --> 24:43.706
These villages look carpetbombed.

24:43.707 --> 24:46.842
Defense confirms it's military action.

24:46.843 --> 24:49.512
General Bo Htun sent in troops
to burn everything to the ground

24:49.513 --> 24:51.881
and drive out the Rohingya population.

24:51.882 --> 24:54.048
There's evidence of mass graves.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.187
So we are looking at ethnic cleansing.

24:58.188 --> 24:59.922
Yep. Textbook case.

24:59.923 --> 25:03.459
Well, now the question
is did this begin

25:03.460 --> 25:06.362
the day that President
Khaing left the country

25:06.363 --> 25:08.397
because the military didn't want him

25:08.398 --> 25:10.332
to know about it or because

25:10.333 --> 25:12.268
they were providing him with a cover?

25:12.269 --> 25:14.770
One way he's completely powerless

25:14.771 --> 25:17.573
and the other way, he is complicit.

25:17.574 --> 25:22.411
Either way, our honored guest
is a potential war criminal.

25:22.412 --> 25:25.081
What do we do next?

25:25.082 --> 25:27.116
Find out what he knows.

25:27.117 --> 25:30.319
Either leverage the heck out
of him or offer him our help.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.687
You know, I might have something

25:31.688 --> 25:33.354
that could help with the leveraging.

25:38.862 --> 25:42.798
My supreme commander assures
me there've been no actions

25:42.799 --> 25:44.300
against innocent civilians.

25:44.301 --> 25:47.470
These are whole villages
burned to the ground.

25:47.471 --> 25:51.574
This can't simply be people retreating

25:51.575 --> 25:53.042
in fear of retaliation.

25:53.043 --> 25:54.977
This is ethnic cleansing.

25:54.978 --> 25:57.813
I must reject this
inflammatory terminology.

25:57.814 --> 26:01.650
These clearance operations
targeted Bengali terrorists

26:01.651 --> 26:04.620
who killed our security officers
and stole their weapons.

26:04.621 --> 26:06.222
Acts of lawlessness must be answered.

26:06.223 --> 26:10.226
Of course, but there are
ways to enforce laws

26:10.227 --> 26:11.961
without violating the human rights

26:11.962 --> 26:14.897
of your own citizens.

26:14.898 --> 26:20.636
My people suffered 50 years
under a military dictatorship.

26:20.637 --> 26:24.840
This type of autocracy thrives
on hatred and suspicion

26:24.841 --> 26:27.076
to keep its people divided.

26:27.077 --> 26:31.447
To bring Myanmar
together will take time,

26:31.448 --> 26:34.450
economic growth,

26:34.451 --> 26:37.153
the painstaking work
of cultural inclusion,

26:37.154 --> 26:39.321
but I cannot unite my people

26:39.322 --> 26:41.357
when they are threatened by extremists

26:41.358 --> 26:42.758
who seek to annihilate
the very culture

26:42.759 --> 26:44.959
that has hosted them for generations.

26:46.696 --> 26:49.565
I understand.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.268
There's...

26:52.269 --> 26:55.237
one other thing that I
wanted to share with you.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.740
These are drawings that were done

26:57.741 --> 27:01.076
a couple of days ago
by Rohingya children

27:01.077 --> 27:05.581
in a UNICEF camp in Bangladesh.

27:05.582 --> 27:10.019
These are people fleeing
a burning village

27:10.020 --> 27:12.954
under what appears to be
a military helicopter.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.393
These are...

27:17.394 --> 27:19.929
soldiers killing this boy's family.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.330
That's his younger brother

27:21.331 --> 27:24.066
being burned and shot.

27:24.067 --> 27:27.136
Those are his parents.

27:27.137 --> 27:30.439
These are extremely distressing,

27:30.440 --> 27:32.541
if they are authentic.

27:32.542 --> 27:35.878
I don't offer these as proof.

27:35.879 --> 27:37.713
But we do offer these

27:37.714 --> 27:40.983
as evidence that whatever

27:40.984 --> 27:43.552
is being perpetrated in
the name of security

27:43.553 --> 27:45.688
is marking a generation.

27:45.689 --> 27:49.925
If you want to combat violent
extremism in Myanmar,

27:49.926 --> 27:52.528
the actions of your military right now

27:52.529 --> 27:55.431
are doing exactly the opposite.

27:55.432 --> 27:58.734
Thank you for coming, Madam Secretary.

27:58.735 --> 28:01.336
I've heard your message.

28:07.043 --> 28:10.145
I'm gonna leave these here for you.

28:10.146 --> 28:12.980
Good luck, Mr. President.

28:26.647 --> 28:29.352
I didn't realize you could put
cheese on so many things.

28:29.353 --> 28:30.920
Stevie would starve here.

28:30.921 --> 28:33.421
Sorry if it's too American for you.

28:34.958 --> 28:36.826
So, when did you get into
Renoir, Aunt Maureen?

28:36.827 --> 28:39.228
Art class in high school, I guess.

28:39.229 --> 28:40.863
Mrs. Abrams. Did you have her?

28:40.864 --> 28:43.166
No. I had that guy.

28:43.167 --> 28:44.901
Yeah. I can't remember his name.

28:44.902 --> 28:46.436
- That guy.
- Yeah.

28:46.437 --> 28:48.838
Mrs. Abrams was my lifeboat.

28:48.839 --> 28:49.939
Cool. So, you were good at art?

28:49.940 --> 28:51.274
Not like you.

28:51.275 --> 28:54.177
Mostly I loved when she
turned off the lights,

28:54.178 --> 28:56.479
and showed the slides of the paintings

28:56.480 --> 28:57.947
and talked about the
history, you know,

28:57.948 --> 28:59.315
the life of the artist.

28:59.316 --> 29:02.318
Did you ever want to do anything
with it? Study somewhere?

29:02.319 --> 29:04.220
That wasn't possible.

29:04.221 --> 29:05.555
You got good grades, Mo.

29:05.556 --> 29:06.689
You could've gone somewhere.

29:06.690 --> 29:07.724
Maybe in another life.

29:07.725 --> 29:09.692
Maybe with another dad.

29:09.693 --> 29:11.394
By all means,
don't miss an opportunity

29:11.395 --> 29:13.930
to drag Dad through the mud.
Where's that waiter?

29:13.931 --> 29:15.698
I'm just saying that
it wasn't your fault.

29:15.699 --> 29:18.468
No, I was perfectly capable
of crushing my own dreams.

29:18.469 --> 29:20.470
Birth control,
they talk to you about that?

29:20.471 --> 29:21.838
Okay, yes, of course we did.

29:21.839 --> 29:23.139
Come on, what about Shane?

29:23.140 --> 29:25.408
He can barely get anything going.

29:25.409 --> 29:27.276
You think that has nothing to
do with how we were brought up?

29:27.277 --> 29:29.579
You know, where do I fall on
this list of family failures?

29:29.580 --> 29:31.447
You see, I had to work, Alison.
That's something where

29:31.448 --> 29:33.516
you get up and you do something
you don't want to do

29:33.517 --> 29:35.752
- and they pay you for it.
- I don't judge any of us.

29:35.753 --> 29:37.720
It's a miracle that we
can drive and vote.

29:37.721 --> 29:39.789
Well, it's not like you
got anything we didn't.

29:39.790 --> 29:41.491
- Ready to order?
- What are you talking about?

29:41.492 --> 29:42.825
We're gonna need another minute.

29:42.826 --> 29:45.228
I worked at Quick Pick.
You went to UVA.

29:45.229 --> 29:46.429
That was the end of college for me.

29:46.430 --> 29:48.765
How did I keep you
from going to college?

29:48.766 --> 29:50.099
You were the boy. You got the money.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.734
I made my peace with that.
Life isn't fair, kiddo.

29:51.735 --> 29:53.369
- Something they don't tell you.
- Whoa, whoa.

29:53.370 --> 29:56.172
You think Dad paid one
dime of my tuition?

29:56.173 --> 29:57.573
I was ROTC, remember?

29:57.574 --> 29:59.041
And then I paid all
my loans back myself.

29:59.042 --> 30:01.778
- Well, that is not what I was told.
- Then you were lied to.

30:01.779 --> 30:03.746
- Well, why would he say that?
- Because he didn't want you to go.

30:03.747 --> 30:05.982
- What? That is incre...
- I know you don't want me to criticize Dad,

30:05.983 --> 30:08.351
but this right here, the fact
you've been carrying this around

30:08.352 --> 30:11.053
for all these years...
and hehe wanted that, too.

30:11.054 --> 30:12.288
Keep us in line.

30:12.289 --> 30:13.923
That is a terrible thing to say.

30:13.924 --> 30:15.324
Well, it was a terrible thing to do.

30:15.325 --> 30:17.560
And the worst part of it is I
think he did it because...

30:17.561 --> 30:18.995
you were his favorite.

30:18.996 --> 30:20.396
- What?
- II know

30:20.397 --> 30:21.798
you want me to think well of him,

30:21.799 --> 30:24.967
but... I can't.

30:24.968 --> 30:26.601
And this is why.

30:28.972 --> 30:31.874
We can send F18s off a
carrier in the Bay of Bengal

30:31.875 --> 30:33.676
to immediately deter any
further destruction

30:33.677 --> 30:36.846
of the Rohingya villages
in the Rakhine State.

30:36.847 --> 30:39.715
However, with a significant
number of refugees

30:39.716 --> 30:40.850
still fleeing to the border

30:40.851 --> 30:42.451
through here, here and here,

30:42.452 --> 30:44.353
and the open terrain,

30:44.354 --> 30:45.988
there's a very high risk
of civilian casualties.

30:45.989 --> 30:48.057
Where are we with U.N. ground troops?

30:48.058 --> 30:49.792
II reached out to the
secretary general,

30:49.793 --> 30:51.360
but we'd have to wait for a vote.

30:51.361 --> 30:53.696
I think more immediate action

30:53.697 --> 30:54.697
is called for.

30:54.698 --> 30:55.998
We could always send in

30:55.999 --> 30:58.734
our own ground troops,
but that's a direct affront

30:58.735 --> 30:59.902
to the Myanmar military.

30:59.903 --> 31:01.170
I can't imagine, Russell,
you would recommend

31:01.171 --> 31:02.471
that course of action.

31:02.472 --> 31:04.707
Well, there'd be some political
fallout in the region

31:04.708 --> 31:07.076
and at home if any troops were lost.

31:07.077 --> 31:10.646
Have we exhausted all
diplomatic options?

31:10.647 --> 31:12.448
President Khaing is an elected leader

31:12.449 --> 31:15.218
in a country that gives half
of its parliamentary seats

31:15.219 --> 31:16.252
to the military.

31:16.253 --> 31:18.454
There's only so much that he can do.

31:18.455 --> 31:20.823
And so much for the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.

31:20.824 --> 31:22.859
That's part of the problem.

31:22.860 --> 31:24.393
The world thinks that
they elected a saint

31:24.394 --> 31:25.528
and what we are getting

31:25.529 --> 31:27.430
is a politician.

31:27.431 --> 31:29.799
Well, I'll say it.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.134
There's always staying out
of a fight that isn't ours.

31:32.135 --> 31:34.537
It's true. We don't have
a great deal of interest

31:34.538 --> 31:35.671
at stake in the region.

31:35.672 --> 31:38.507
Except the first democracy
in half a century.

31:38.508 --> 31:40.376
Lack of action does carry the risk

31:40.377 --> 31:43.512
of playing out badly in the long term.

31:43.513 --> 31:46.349
Intervening to prevent
another Rwanda...

31:46.350 --> 31:48.184
shouldn't be too hard to sell.

31:48.185 --> 31:51.886
And now is the moment to intervene.

31:56.793 --> 31:58.194
Let's get some sorties in the air.

31:58.195 --> 32:00.630
A show of force they can't ignore.

32:00.631 --> 32:02.765
See if that opens things
up diplomatically.

32:02.766 --> 32:04.766
Yes, ma'am.

32:07.471 --> 32:09.105
Well...

32:09.106 --> 32:12.108
for an acting president, she...

32:12.109 --> 32:14.944
- is suddenly reluctant to act.
- Yeah, it happens

32:14.945 --> 32:17.046
when they're new to office.

32:17.047 --> 32:18.581
The reality sinks in.

32:18.582 --> 32:21.017
So now we've got a couple
of hundred thousand people

32:21.018 --> 32:22.585
stuck between two leaders,

32:22.586 --> 32:24.120
both of them afraid to lead?

32:24.121 --> 32:26.254
Yeah, I can think of a third.

32:28.225 --> 32:30.526
Okay, what's going on with Conrad?

32:30.527 --> 32:32.728
And don't give me the talking points.

32:32.729 --> 32:34.497
There's not a lot to say.

32:34.498 --> 32:36.766
His health is good.

32:36.767 --> 32:39.200
Doctors say he's ready.

32:40.938 --> 32:43.873
Something changed.

32:43.874 --> 32:47.276
I'm not sure he wants it anymore.

32:57.487 --> 33:00.022
Teresa isn't wrong to hesitate.

33:00.023 --> 33:02.491
It's never easy putting
our troops on the line,

33:02.492 --> 33:04.427
even when the cause is just.

33:04.428 --> 33:06.529
I know you understand her reticence.

33:06.530 --> 33:09.198
I understand it because I
nearly blundered us into a war

33:09.199 --> 33:10.700
over some deranged folly.

33:10.701 --> 33:13.102
- It's not an easy thing to live with.
- You were suffering

33:13.103 --> 33:14.437
the effects of a brain tumor.

33:14.438 --> 33:16.905
The country understands that.

33:18.141 --> 33:20.742
We need you, Conrad.

33:24.848 --> 33:28.451
When my brother was in his
senior year in high school,

33:28.452 --> 33:32.320
he started to hear a voice.

33:33.056 --> 33:35.825
He didn't tell anybody at the time.

33:35.826 --> 33:40.162
It was only later he told me he
thought he was talking to God.

33:40.163 --> 33:43.699
And then when the voice
told him to hurt himself...

33:43.700 --> 33:46.668
he knew it was the Devil.

33:48.372 --> 33:50.940
Knew it.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.241
Took a full breakdown,

33:52.242 --> 33:54.310
the first of many, before
he finally accepted

33:54.311 --> 33:57.313
that his reality wasn't...

33:57.314 --> 33:59.281
everyone else's.

33:59.282 --> 34:01.616
He was totally sure.

34:02.652 --> 34:05.087
You passed all the tests.

34:05.088 --> 34:06.422
And I...

34:06.423 --> 34:10.092
was completely sure about
calling that strike on Russia.

34:10.092 --> 34:13.129
How can I ever be
sure of myself again?

34:13.130 --> 34:15.464
That fact that you are
being this careful

34:15.465 --> 34:18.199
proves that you are back to
the man that this country

34:18.201 --> 34:20.636
chose to be its leader.

34:20.637 --> 34:24.105
If I can't trust myself,
I can't lead, Bess.

34:29.813 --> 34:32.181
You should take...

34:32.181 --> 34:33.949
some more time.

34:33.949 --> 34:36.786
Think it through.

34:36.786 --> 34:39.054
But while you're thinking it through,

34:39.056 --> 34:42.556
could I ask you to
consider one request?

34:48.812 --> 34:51.879
Julie, where are we putting
the... Never mind, found it..

34:53.248 --> 34:56.556
Excuse me, Director Dalton?

34:56.556 --> 34:58.558
How can I help you?

34:58.559 --> 35:01.394
Russell Jackson.
I, work with Ted Barnes

35:01.395 --> 35:03.196
at party HQ.

35:04.432 --> 35:06.833
I don't think we met before.

35:06.834 --> 35:08.868
I generally avoid daylight.

35:11.072 --> 35:13.239
I watched your campaign.

35:13.240 --> 35:16.843
You shouldn't be the one packing up.

35:16.844 --> 35:18.611
Yeah. I think it's time to admit

35:18.612 --> 35:20.780
I am not cut out for politics.

35:20.781 --> 35:23.383
No, no, no, no.
II saw your kickoff speech

35:23.384 --> 35:24.884
at the Steel Industries.

35:24.885 --> 35:27.687
You said a lot of things
they didn't want to hear,

35:27.688 --> 35:30.256
and they loved you anyway.

35:30.257 --> 35:32.692
- That's pretty much the whole gig.
- Well,

35:32.693 --> 35:35.261
that and winning.

35:35.262 --> 35:38.431
I think we both know why
you didn't win this one.

35:38.432 --> 35:41.301
Yep. Can't miss the debate.

35:41.302 --> 35:43.536
Trust me, the point's been made.

35:43.537 --> 35:44.971
Well, the mistake

35:44.972 --> 35:47.073
wasn't missing a debate,
the mistake was...

35:47.074 --> 35:49.308
hiding the reason why.

35:50.444 --> 35:53.379
I'm very well connected.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.482
Apparently.

35:55.483 --> 35:58.718
You're a wonk and a spook.

35:58.719 --> 36:01.988
You're not supposed to connect
at the podium, but...

36:01.989 --> 36:03.790
you do.

36:03.791 --> 36:05.592
'Cause you're real.

36:05.593 --> 36:07.360
You can't fake that.

36:07.361 --> 36:10.363
I've worked for plenty who tried.

36:10.364 --> 36:13.566
So whoever talked you
into that BS statement

36:13.567 --> 36:16.302
about cancelling due to
a scheduling matter,

36:16.303 --> 36:19.205
that's the guy who blew it, not you.

36:19.206 --> 36:22.641
The statement was mine.

36:23.377 --> 36:26.111
Not throwing your team under the bus.

36:27.014 --> 36:29.781
That's another reason
politics needs you.

36:31.519 --> 36:33.353
We all have...

36:33.354 --> 36:37.656
family issues that
keep us up at night.

36:39.426 --> 36:43.595
Stop trying to be your
idea of a politician.

36:44.331 --> 36:45.832
Be you.

36:45.833 --> 36:47.866
'Cause that guy...

36:49.670 --> 36:52.004
that guy has a future.

36:55.609 --> 36:57.310
What?

36:57.311 --> 37:01.481
It's a little hard getting
schooled in authenticity

37:01.482 --> 37:04.284
by a guy with a combover.

37:04.285 --> 37:06.318
How's that for real?

37:12.059 --> 37:13.860
Mr. President.

37:13.861 --> 37:16.062
They didn't tell me it was you.

37:16.063 --> 37:17.263
It's good to meet you, Mr. President.

37:17.264 --> 37:18.765
This is a tremendous honor. Please.

37:18.766 --> 37:21.401
I didn't expect to see you until
the presentation ceremony.

37:21.402 --> 37:23.269
Well, things being what they are,

37:23.270 --> 37:26.838
this might not be the right
time for the Medal of Freedom.

37:26.839 --> 37:30.141
But Acting President Hurst
thought I could offer

37:30.142 --> 37:32.710
some counsel on your
refugee situation.

37:32.711 --> 37:35.280
I see. Can I offer you
something to drink?

37:35.281 --> 37:37.849
I'm good, thanks. I'm...

37:37.850 --> 37:40.351
I'm going to get right to the point.

37:40.352 --> 37:42.287
You're a new leader.

37:42.288 --> 37:46.391
It seems any way you move, you
bring the whole thing down.

37:46.392 --> 37:48.326
- It's a bit more complicated.
- I'm sure.

37:48.327 --> 37:50.462
Which puts you in the fog.

37:50.463 --> 37:52.730
It's where you'll spend
too much of your time

37:52.731 --> 37:54.532
if you're a good leader, so...

37:54.533 --> 37:57.535
let me clear it up for you.

37:57.536 --> 38:00.271
You need to bring your
Rohingya people home.

38:00.272 --> 38:01.973
It is not possible at this time

38:01.974 --> 38:04.608
to repatriate the Muslims
of the Rakhine State.

38:05.344 --> 38:08.211
Is that how they refer to themselves?

38:10.115 --> 38:12.150
Mr. President...

38:12.151 --> 38:14.552
I am deeply grateful for the support

38:14.553 --> 38:17.355
the United States and many
other nations have shown me.

38:17.356 --> 38:19.958
But I was elected to lead
the people of Myanmar,

38:19.959 --> 38:22.727
- not to please the Western world.
- That's right.

38:22.728 --> 38:24.896
So you must lead all your people.

38:24.897 --> 38:26.498
You're asking me

38:26.499 --> 38:29.901
to put 97% of my country at great risk

38:29.902 --> 38:32.871
in order to defend three percent.

38:32.872 --> 38:36.341
No country willing to massacre
nearly a million of its citizens

38:36.342 --> 38:38.409
can ever call itself a democracy.

38:38.410 --> 38:40.178
I know your military uses

38:40.179 --> 38:43.314
fear and suspicion to
hold onto its power.

38:43.315 --> 38:45.116
But you have words.

38:45.117 --> 38:47.385
The same words that won an election.

38:47.386 --> 38:49.821
I've spoken of peace
and reconciliation

38:49.822 --> 38:51.489
for over 20 years...

38:51.490 --> 38:52.857
Say their name.

38:52.858 --> 38:54.158
Start there.

38:54.159 --> 38:56.027
Then give them a seat at the table

38:56.028 --> 38:57.662
so they can speak their own words.

38:57.663 --> 38:58.997
That's how you change things.

38:58.998 --> 39:01.165
You say this as if it's easily done.

39:01.166 --> 39:04.502
Finding your voice as a
leader is never easy, but...

39:04.503 --> 39:06.671
it's pretty much the whole gig.

39:08.307 --> 39:11.242
"The obstacle is the path."

39:11.243 --> 39:13.745
Isn't that a Buddhist saying?

39:13.746 --> 39:16.414
With the greatest respect, sir...

39:16.415 --> 39:18.583
leave the Buddhism to me.

39:18.584 --> 39:20.385
You have de Tocqueville.

39:20.386 --> 39:23.955
"Nothing is more wonderful
than freedom...

39:23.956 --> 39:27.491
but nothing is harder
to learn to use."

39:31.163 --> 39:33.231
I hope to present you with that medal

39:33.232 --> 39:34.933
the next time we see each other.

39:44.176 --> 39:46.711
It was a scene

39:46.712 --> 39:50.548
of devastation in Galveston,
Texas, as a freak storm...

39:50.549 --> 39:53.451
- Here you go, Aunt Maureen.
- Thanks, kiddo.

39:53.452 --> 39:55.420
And I got you this. What is this?

39:55.421 --> 39:58.021
I got it for you at the
gift shop yesterday.

39:58.791 --> 40:00.658
Isn't that pretty.

40:00.659 --> 40:01.993
I know it's

40:01.994 --> 40:03.728
a little bourgeois, but Dad is saying

40:03.729 --> 40:06.097
that I need to be more openminded.

40:06.098 --> 40:09.601
He also said that you're
a total fiend at cards.

40:09.602 --> 40:12.303
That's because I beat him
out of his birthday money.

40:12.304 --> 40:14.305
Truth is, he's an easy mark.

40:14.306 --> 40:16.507
I heard that.

40:16.508 --> 40:18.876
Want to show me some skills?

40:18.877 --> 40:20.111
Well, maybe later.

40:20.112 --> 40:22.313
Watch out, Ali, this is how it starts.

40:22.314 --> 40:23.681
She pretends that

40:23.682 --> 40:26.150
she's not interested, and
then she wraps herself

40:26.151 --> 40:27.652
around you like a snake.

40:27.653 --> 40:29.520
I am trying to watch here.

40:29.521 --> 40:30.955
Come on, one hand.

40:30.956 --> 40:33.391
What's your game? Fivecard draw.

40:33.392 --> 40:34.993
Shall we make it interesting?

40:34.994 --> 40:36.961
Ooh. Glutton for punishment, I see.

40:36.962 --> 40:38.429
Why don't we play for cookies?

40:38.430 --> 40:40.398
All right. I'm in for a snickerdoodle.

40:40.399 --> 40:43.567
I will raise you an oatmeal raisin.

40:45.337 --> 40:46.571
Anytime with that deal there.

40:46.572 --> 40:48.906
Complaining about the
deal... an amateur move.

40:48.907 --> 40:50.241
How much was

40:50.242 --> 40:52.243
- that birthday money again?
- 50 bucks.

40:52.244 --> 40:55.113
Do you even remember
what you did with it?

40:55.114 --> 40:57.982
Saved it for college.

40:59.218 --> 41:01.486
In responding to
the perceived threat

41:01.487 --> 41:03.655
of ethnic unrest between
the Buddhist majority

41:03.656 --> 41:05.222
and the Muslim, or Rohingya, people.

41:44.196 --> 41:45.630
Did I miss it?

41:45.631 --> 41:47.131
You're good. Slow down.

41:47.132 --> 41:50.368
There was traffic, and...
and then that lady at security,

41:50.369 --> 41:51.736
she had a lot of questions.

41:51.737 --> 41:53.004
I didn't make everybody wait?

41:53.005 --> 41:54.772
Take a breath, John.

41:54.773 --> 41:57.275
- They'll wait as long as I tell them to.
- Yeah.

41:57.276 --> 41:58.876
I guess so. You're the big chief.

41:58.877 --> 42:02.447
Well, I'm not the big chief
again until I sign this thing.

42:02.448 --> 42:04.582
Sir? When you're ready.

42:04.583 --> 42:07.752
It's good to see you again, John.

42:07.753 --> 42:09.387
I'm glad I made it.

42:09.388 --> 42:10.655
Me, too.

42:24.870 --> 42:29.402
