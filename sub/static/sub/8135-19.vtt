00:00.967 --> 00:04.232
Michael, I'm picking up two men on
the ridge above you. One has a rifle.

00:04.304 --> 00:07.034
Stephanie, get inside! Go!

00:07.107 --> 00:09.041
KITT, cover us!

00:11.077 --> 00:13.602
Our conspiracy case
rests on your testimony.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.877
No matter what happens,
you stay with KITT.

00:19.119 --> 00:22.782
But you just seem so familiar to
me... Your voice, the way you move.

00:24.324 --> 00:27.191
They're gonna try and take her out of the
picture before she gets to the grand jury.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:41.708 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.905
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

01:54.714 --> 01:58.445
Yes, it's been set for, uh,
10:00 on Monday.

01:58.518 --> 02:01.851
Right. Okay. Uh-huh.
We'll see you then.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.855
Mm-hmm.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.961
Hi. It's almost 5:30.
Anything before I leave?

02:14.033 --> 02:17.525
No, I can't think of anything.
Oh, wait.

02:17.604 --> 02:21.563
If you're going down, you could help a
forgetful client retrieve his briefcase.

02:21.641 --> 02:26.135
He's on his way over.
A silver sedan, chauffeur, the works.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.146
Sounds hard to miss.
Anyone I know?

02:28.214 --> 02:32.412
No, no. Just another wealthy bachelor
with tax shelter problems.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.045
You're right.
It's no one I know.

02:35.121 --> 02:37.817
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night. Good night.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.789
It's a setup!

03:13.860 --> 03:16.124
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me go.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.893
- Calm down, miss. You're not going anywhere.
- Stop it. Let me go.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.833
Federal agents,
Department of Justice.

03:22.902 --> 03:25.268
Right this way.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.042
Let's go.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.214
Michael?
Yeah, KITT.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.282
"C" is beyond your grasp,

03:47.360 --> 03:49.658
and "D" is beyond your vision.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.391
I didn't know
you had perfect pitch.

03:52.465 --> 03:56.492
- It's a cross I have to bear.
- You do it so well.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.730
Thank you.
De nada.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.584
- Can I get you something?
- Very funny.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.937
Stevie.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.629
The money in that briefcase is marked.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.333
It's illegal money.
It's dirty.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.501
It comes from a man
named Anthony Solan.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.510
Now, that name may mean
nothing to you,

05:12.578 --> 05:14.808
but it's well known
at the Department of Justice,

05:14.881 --> 05:17.008
the F.B.I. and various other circles.

05:17.083 --> 05:20.416
What isn't as well known
is the very special relationship...

05:20.486 --> 05:23.319
that exists between Anthony Solan...

05:23.389 --> 05:27.348
and a well-known attorney
by the name of Gilbert Cole.

05:27.427 --> 05:30.692
I don't believe that.
You don't have to.

05:30.763 --> 05:33.698
We've had your boss
under investigation for six months.

05:33.766 --> 05:38.533
We know of the connection between him and
Solan, but we haven't been able to prove it.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.663
Now we can.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.231
That briefcase proves conspiracy.

05:43.309 --> 05:46.039
If that's true,
why don't you arrest him?

05:46.112 --> 05:49.081
He's a smart lawyer.

05:49.148 --> 05:53.744
Would you let a guilty man go free
just because he's smart?

05:53.820 --> 05:56.254
Look, I'll spell it out for you.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.950
Our conspiracy case
rests on your testimony.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.984
You've got to say that he gave you
the briefcase with specific instructions.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.432
What if I refuse?

06:10.002 --> 06:12.095
If you refuse,

06:12.171 --> 06:17.370
and there's insufficient evidence
to prove that the briefcase is Gilbert's,

06:20.580 --> 06:23.549
then there's only one person left
to hang it on,

06:26.552 --> 06:28.679
and I'm looking at her.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.799
Michael,

06:40.867 --> 06:44.428
I love you.

06:44.504 --> 06:47.439
I love you.

06:47.507 --> 06:50.237
Don't ever leave me.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.402
Michael,

06:52.478 --> 06:55.470
I love you.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.745
I love you.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.952
Stephanie?
Yes.

07:44.030 --> 07:47.022
I'm Michael Knight.
I arranged for your bail.

07:47.099 --> 07:51.001
Do I know you?
No.

07:51.070 --> 07:55.302
Do you work for Mr. Cole? No, I work for
the Foundation for Law and Government.

07:55.374 --> 07:58.502
I'm sorry.
I don't know of them.

07:58.578 --> 08:03.379
Why would a foundation
I've never heard of post bail for me?

08:03.449 --> 08:07.180
Well, we're interested in your case.
We help people we're interested in.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.949
I'm not sure
that answers my question.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.956
Maybe I can fill you in
on the way.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.958
On the way where?
To your apartment.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.960
Unless you want
to hang around here.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.223
No.
I didn't think so.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.871
How did you know I live
in an apartment?

08:27.940 --> 08:30.966
Your address was on
the arrest report.

08:31.043 --> 08:34.068
And how did you get your hands
on the arrest report?

08:34.145 --> 08:36.511
Stephanie, the Foundation
has a lot of friends.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.745
It seems like everyone has friends
in high places except me.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.284
Sorry.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.019
Just a little self-pity
slipping through.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.323
You're entitled.

08:49.395 --> 08:52.125
But Stephanie,
you do have friends if you choose.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.626
Thanks, really.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.669
But my boss is going to help me.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.934
In fact, he's probably arranging bail
for me right now.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.401
I appreciate your sense
of loyalty and trust, I really do.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.107
But Stephanie, so far the facts
indicate your boss...

09:09.181 --> 09:11.979
is much more
than an innocent bystander.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.679
Everyone seems to think
that he's guilty of...

09:14.754 --> 09:17.120
I don't know... some major tie-in
with the underworld.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.419
- I don't believe it.
- I'm not saying you have to.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.222
All I'm saying is that until we can
develop some more information,

09:22.295 --> 09:25.423
you'd be real wise not to lock yourself
into a particular defense...

09:25.498 --> 09:27.432
or a particular person.

09:48.688 --> 09:51.316
Well, what do you think?
I don't know what to think.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.449
Tell you what...
Do it my way for 24 hours.

09:53.526 --> 09:57.189
If you're not convinced by then, you're
free to handle it any way you choose.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.460
Why are you doing all of this?

10:00.533 --> 10:02.467
I told you why.
I know.

10:02.535 --> 10:07.598
The Foundation and all that. But it
just seems like there's something more.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.607
Is there?

10:10.876 --> 10:12.810
No.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.804
But you just seem
so familiar to me...

10:15.881 --> 10:17.815
your voice,
the way you move.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.817
Hey, do we have
a deal or what?

10:19.885 --> 10:22.183
All right.
All right.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.984
I'll see you in a couple hours.
Now, you keep this door locked.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.991
And don't let anybody in.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.070
Michael?

10:39.138 --> 10:40.833
Yeah, KITT.

10:40.906 --> 10:44.364
Are you all right? I took the
liberty of scanning your vital signs.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.843
Your blood pressure
is 190 over 120,

10:46.912 --> 10:49.403
and your pulse is 104.
Good.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.508
Not according to my information
on the human body.

10:52.585 --> 10:57.147
What I mean is,
it's not as bad as I thought.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.952
Gilbert Cole.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.956
Hello?

11:34.660 --> 11:38.061
Stephanie, is that you?

12:01.187 --> 12:04.384
Who is Stephanie Mason?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.027
Bonnie...

12:12.098 --> 12:16.558
In my other life,
when I had a different face,

12:16.635 --> 12:19.297
when I didn't have this identity,

12:19.371 --> 12:22.499
when I was Michael Long,

12:24.610 --> 12:27.545
Stephanie and I were engaged
to be married.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.350
Michael, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.615
Yeah. No one knows,

12:35.688 --> 12:37.622
except Devon.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.352
Now you.

12:52.505 --> 12:56.168
I've programmed KITT
with everything I could get on Cole.

12:56.242 --> 12:59.405
I hope it helps.
Yeah, me too.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.571
Thanks a lot.
Michael,

13:04.316 --> 13:06.250
be careful.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.668
Stephanie?

14:09.782 --> 14:12.615
Hey!

14:16.488 --> 14:18.786
Stephanie! Stephanie, it's me!

14:18.858 --> 14:22.259
It's Michael!
Oh, Michael.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.889
Oh! Oh, I thought
they'd come back.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.934
I didn't know...
Who? What happened?

14:29.001 --> 14:32.095
Two men came while you were gone.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.731
They tried to break in
when I wouldn't open the door, so...

14:36.675 --> 14:38.700
I ran out the back.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.711
I...

14:40.779 --> 14:43.771
It's okay, Stevie.
It's okay.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.454
Why did you call me that?

14:50.522 --> 14:52.752
What?

14:52.825 --> 14:55.817
"Stevie." Nobody calls me that anymore.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.693
I guess I'm pretty thorough, huh?

14:58.764 --> 15:01.324
I must've read it in
the Foundation's files.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.391
Come on.
I gotta get you out of here,

15:03.469 --> 15:06.267
get you someplace safe.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.738
Go put some clothes together, huh?

15:43.575 --> 15:46.135
- They just left the apartment.
- Find out where they go.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.509
Right now
that's all I want to know.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.653
What are you looking for?

15:56.722 --> 15:59.885
The microwave and the sunlamp.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.655
Really. I've never seen
anything like this before.

16:02.728 --> 16:06.220
I'm still amazed if someone
has a phone in their car.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.366
All right.
Might as well deal with this now.

16:12.571 --> 16:16.200
KITT, say hello to Stephanie.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.539
Stephanie, meet my car, KITT.

16:20.546 --> 16:24.073
Say something, KITT.

16:26.318 --> 16:30.345
Come on, say something.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

16:30.422 --> 16:35.485
Hello, Stephanie. Michael isn't crazy,
not in the clinical sense, at least.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.586
Thank you very much.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.597
He talks.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.293
How can a car... talk?

16:42.368 --> 16:46.930
Computers. Don't ask me how. I
don't know. I don't wanna know.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.080
How you doin'?
Feel better?

16:56.148 --> 17:00.244
Aside from trying to adjust
to being in a car that talks?

17:00.319 --> 17:02.685
Yes, better.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.689
Thanks.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.657
As a matter of fact, the farther
away we get, the better I feel.

17:10.295 --> 17:14.789
Where are we going? The Foundation
has a retreat just north of here.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.262
What's the matter?

17:19.338 --> 17:22.272
I just realized
I hadn't asked you that.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.275
That scares me.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.073
What scares you?

17:27.146 --> 17:30.047
That I would trust
a stranger so much.

17:31.216 --> 17:35.209
I think the reason I did
is this feeling I have,

17:35.287 --> 17:38.256
this feeling I know you.

17:38.323 --> 17:41.087
Michael, there's a car following us.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.788
A blue sedan.

17:43.862 --> 17:47.025
- You think it's the men that came to my apartment?
- That's my guess.

17:47.099 --> 17:51.229
KITT, give me the car's license number
and visuals on both men inside.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.237
Right away, Michael.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.899
There are the visuals, Michael. And
I have the number. Then let's go.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.737
Hang on, Stephanie.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.342
There's an obstruction ahead, Michael.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.251
Michael?
I see it, KITT.

18:12.524 --> 18:15.015
Hang on, Stephanie.

18:23.168 --> 18:24.795
Whoo!

18:24.870 --> 18:27.304
How was that?
That was fantastic.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.810
Any reading on them, KITT?
None.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.874
- Not only does he talk, he has a sense of humor.
- I wouldn't go that far.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.477
I beg your pardon.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.949
The guy's got a car
twice the car we've got.

18:49.027 --> 18:51.655
What am I supposed to do?
All right, forget it.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.630
I think I know
where they're going.

18:53.699 --> 18:57.294
Seems they've got a place in the
mountains, 40 or 50 miles north.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.626
Well, here we are.

19:24.696 --> 19:27.324
Ah, it's beautiful!

19:27.399 --> 19:29.663
A fireplace too?
You want a fireplace?

19:29.735 --> 19:31.896
Yeah.
You got a fireplace.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.268
Well, thank you.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.773
Hello. You're late.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.749
I expected you
over an hour ago.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.047
Who is he?
It's my boss.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.054
Oh.

19:50.122 --> 19:53.956
Since Michael seems to have lost the
power of speech, let me introduce myself.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.462
I'm Devon Miles. And you
are Stephanie Mason. Yes.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.463
How do you do?
Fine.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.522
Won't you make yourself at home?

20:02.601 --> 20:05.900
By the way, uh,
the tea is very good.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.462
And now, if you'll excuse us,

20:08.540 --> 20:11.065
I'd like to have a word
with Michael outside.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.077
Sure. I'll unpack.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.083
Does she know who you really are?
No.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.210
Good. Keep it that way.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.481
Devon, it seems to me...

20:23.555 --> 20:26.217
the Department of Justice is
trying to put the squeeze on her.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.282
Either she testifies
and implicates her boss,

20:28.360 --> 20:31.488
or they're gonna try her
for conspiracy charges.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.532
Whoever's behind this whole thing...

20:34.600 --> 20:37.626
knows that if she testifies,
they're in big trouble.

20:37.703 --> 20:41.503
I think they're gonna try and take her out of
the picture before she gets to the grand jury.

20:41.573 --> 20:45.270
I'll see what I can do, starting
with the car that followed you.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.142
Michael, you've chosen to do...

20:48.213 --> 20:51.114
the most difficult thing
a man in your position can do...

20:51.183 --> 20:53.117
to help someone you love.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.119
If it had been anyone
other than you...

20:55.187 --> 20:58.281
and that girl in there,
anyone other than who she is...

20:58.357 --> 21:00.291
I'd forbid it.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.331
Thanks.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.763
Hey, you hungry?

21:12.838 --> 21:17.036
Please say yes, because I'm starved,
and I don't want to feel guilty.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.043
Yes.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.575
What?

21:25.651 --> 21:29.883
Have you ever had the feeling
you've been someplace before,

21:29.955 --> 21:33.391
said the same things
to the same person?

21:34.960 --> 21:38.828
I know it can't be true,
but that's how it feels.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.990
Come on.
You're just too tired.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.602
Yeah, I guess.

21:49.074 --> 21:52.635
I guess I've been working so hard
trying to get my life together,

21:52.711 --> 21:55.043
and take care of myself...

21:55.113 --> 21:57.411
Look at me now.
I can't even go home.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.712
I can't do anything without you.

21:59.785 --> 22:02.253
I'm dependent on you.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.420
The last time I depended
on someone, I lost him.

22:08.894 --> 22:12.352
His name was Michael too.

22:12.431 --> 22:15.662
Michael Long.

22:37.589 --> 22:40.956
You know all about me. I don't know
anything about you. It's not fair.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.256
I'll tell you later.
Tonight?

22:43.328 --> 22:45.262
Yeah, maybe tonight.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.859
In the meantime, I refuse to let
this gorgeous day go by...

22:51.937 --> 22:54.064
without picking some flowers.

22:54.139 --> 22:58.576
Is that all right? It's all
right. Just don't go too far.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.894
Michael, I'm picking up
two men on the ridge above you.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.906
One has a rifle.
Stephanie!

23:28.974 --> 23:31.738
Get inside! Go!

23:31.810 --> 23:33.744
KITT, cover her!

23:40.185 --> 23:42.119
Stevie!

23:42.187 --> 23:43.745
Let's go.

25:25.957 --> 25:27.982
Morning, Michael.

25:28.059 --> 25:31.028
Come now.
It's unlike you not to eat.

25:31.096 --> 25:33.155
Just look at the breakfast
I had prepared for you.

25:33.231 --> 25:36.496
All your favorite things...
Steak, eggs, greasy potatoes.

25:38.303 --> 25:41.204
Michael, she'll be fine.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.140
You have Doctor Carlysle's
personal assurance on that.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.770
God, Devon, I've gone over KITT's
programming twice. I've got nothing.

25:47.846 --> 25:49.814
How about you? Any luck? Some.

25:49.881 --> 25:53.681
What?
Regarding Gilbert Cole.

25:53.752 --> 25:56.550
It seems he's everything
the Department of Justice says he is.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.215
Which is what exactly?

25:59.291 --> 26:02.556
Well, amongst other things, that he's
a business partner of Anthony Solan.

26:02.627 --> 26:06.723
His primary contribution to that
partnership is laundering Solan's money.

26:06.798 --> 26:10.598
It's a strange world we live in,
isn't it, Devon?

26:10.669 --> 26:13.934
The Department of Justice knows
that Gilbert Cole is breaking the law.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.939
I know he's behind
shooting Stephanie.

26:16.007 --> 26:19.499
We can't move a damn finger
against him. Calm yourself, Michael.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.570
It serves no one's purpose
to react from emo...

26:22.647 --> 26:25.673
I'm not reacting!
I'm feeling.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.353
Is it okay to feel?

26:29.421 --> 26:32.356
Does the Foundation permit that?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.949
Do you?

26:35.026 --> 26:37.722
Come.
Let's take a walk.

26:43.702 --> 26:47.900
I'm not so much concerned
about Stephanie dying.

26:47.973 --> 26:49.941
I'm more concerned
about her living.

26:50.008 --> 26:51.942
What does that mean?

26:52.010 --> 26:54.774
Well, have you thought
about afterwards?

26:54.846 --> 26:57.440
When this is all over,
what are you going to do then?

26:57.515 --> 26:59.608
I know I want to be with her.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.879
And how do you propose
to accomplish that?

27:01.953 --> 27:03.887
Tell her who you really are?

27:03.955 --> 27:06.788
Set up housekeeping, and, as the
saying goes, live happily ever after?

27:06.858 --> 27:09.156
I don't know.

27:09.227 --> 27:12.856
You saying that's impossible? You
know better than to ask that question.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.659
You have too many enemies
in the real world.

27:18.203 --> 27:22.139
You can't go back.
You can't even afford to look back.

27:32.183 --> 27:35.448
I suppose loving her...

27:35.520 --> 27:37.488
means making
another kind of choice.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.421
Michael, when I was
with the O.S.S. in France,

27:41.493 --> 27:45.020
I met a young lady,
a very special young lady.

27:45.096 --> 27:48.293
I met her in a little cafe
just outside of Paris.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.960
I remember
she was wearing a white dress,

27:51.036 --> 27:53.368
and she looked like an angel.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.739
Well, we were young.
Time was short.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.971
We fell very much in love.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.715
But soon I realized
I had a choice to make.

28:04.783 --> 28:08.048
After all, I too was in
a dangerous occupation.

28:13.491 --> 28:15.425
I love her, Devon.

28:17.262 --> 28:20.095
You telling me
I can't ever love anybody?

28:22.100 --> 28:24.091
Everything changes, Michael.

28:24.169 --> 28:27.866
I can't look into the future, but I know
that right now you have a choice to make.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.271
A decision.
I know you'll make the right one.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.811
Oh, uh,

28:34.879 --> 28:38.110
before I go,
I have something else.

28:38.183 --> 28:41.084
I don't want to tell you this,
but I feel I must.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.154
Stephanie was arrested twice,

28:44.222 --> 28:48.750
represented by Cole
on both occasions.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.921
For what, jaywalking?

28:51.996 --> 28:54.487
Solicitation.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.729
I'm sorry, Michael.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.009
- I want to talk to you.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

29:05.076 --> 29:08.978
- Name is Michael Knight.
- It's all right, Claire. I'll handle it. It's okay.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.149
All right. You're here.
What do you want?

29:13.218 --> 29:16.187
Did you defend Stephanie Mason
on criminal charges?

29:16.254 --> 29:20.350
- You have her? Is she with you?
- I didn't ask you what you wanted. You asked me.

29:20.425 --> 29:24.418
- Just answer my question.
- You get tough with me, I won't answer anything.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.795
Stephanie Mason was never
arrested on solicitation.

29:27.866 --> 29:31.324
So when it popped up on a computer,
I started asking some serious questions.

29:31.402 --> 29:34.428
The first was who salted
a phony bust on her and why.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.440
I'm still working
on that one.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.703
The second question
is who represented her.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.678
I got that one, man,
and that's you.

29:42.747 --> 29:45.773
Now, my plan for the first one
is to start rattlin' cages.

29:45.850 --> 29:48.944
And I'm gonna keep rattlin' cages
until all the monkeys fall.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.955
So you get yourself
a real good grip.

30:04.803 --> 30:09.172
KITT, if I'm right, a call should be
going out of Cole's office right about now.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.505
See if you can pick it up.
Right away, Michael.

30:13.578 --> 30:16.138
Yeah.

30:16.214 --> 30:19.206
He was just here,
Michael Knight character.

30:19.284 --> 30:23.152
He was hot, raging about how
Stephanie was never arrested,

30:23.221 --> 30:27.248
and how he was gonna find out
who salted her record. Good.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.259
Let him spin his wheels
for a while.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.194
It'll buy us time to find out
where they're keeping her.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.197
We'll find her.

30:44.275 --> 30:46.743
- How'd we do?
- We drew a blank, Michael.

30:46.811 --> 30:49.780
A call went out on his private line,
but he has a scrambler on it.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.248
Terrific.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.817
Bonnie, I think we've
got something here.

31:01.893 --> 31:04.589
Cross-reference the union case.

31:04.662 --> 31:06.789
Coming right up.

31:09.267 --> 31:11.792
- Oh, Michael. Glad to see you.
- What's up?

31:11.870 --> 31:15.601
Look at this.
Those two cases Cole recently lost.

31:15.673 --> 31:20.110
In one of them he represented
a splinter group of a large labor union.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.443
They were trying to form
an independent bargaining unit and lost.

31:24.749 --> 31:27.047
Guess whose name pops up
on the winning side...

31:30.922 --> 31:34.449
- Anthony Solan.
- His name keeps popping up.

31:34.525 --> 31:37.858
Yes. Well, Solan was also a principal...

31:37.929 --> 31:43.094
behind the scenes
in Cole's other major defeat.

31:43.167 --> 31:48.764
That was a-a zoning dispute
over a shopping center site.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.775
I'll bet a little more digging
will turn up a connection.

31:51.843 --> 31:54.676
You need some more, I'll
get you some more. Michael,

31:54.746 --> 31:58.273
the grand jury convenes the
day after tomorrow. Yeah.

32:41.259 --> 32:43.284
Solan.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.295
Anthony Solan.

32:45.363 --> 32:48.799
Michael, my sensors detect
the electronic signal of a silent alarm.

33:13.024 --> 33:15.754
There is a security guard
approaching, Michael.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.387
- How much time does that give me?
- One minute, Michael.

33:32.877 --> 33:34.936
He's approaching
this corridor, Michael.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.947
Okay, pal.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.920
Hey, Stevie.

34:19.556 --> 34:22.754
It's me. It's Michael.

34:25.696 --> 34:28.187
Michael?

34:31.668 --> 34:33.899
Where are you?

34:35.172 --> 34:37.107
I'm here.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.342
Right here.

34:43.313 --> 34:46.010
I woke up,

34:46.083 --> 34:48.746
and you were gone.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.947
I was...
Don't talk, huh?

34:53.724 --> 34:56.056
You're not alone anymore.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.326
Michael,

35:01.399 --> 35:04.926
don't go away again.

35:05.002 --> 35:08.028
Please, don't leave me.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.939
I won't.

35:11.008 --> 35:12.942
It's okay. I won't.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.542
Shhh.

35:29.026 --> 35:32.518
"Lawyer names law clerk
in gangland conspiracy."

35:35.266 --> 35:39.498
It's a lie!
Everything in there is a lie!

35:41.005 --> 35:43.803
What does he hope to accomplish?

35:43.875 --> 35:47.003
Does he really expect
the grand jury to believe...

35:47.078 --> 35:50.070
that I'm a-a-a money courier
for the underworld?

35:50.148 --> 35:54.016
Stephanie, don't be
too sure they won't.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.986
It's all a matter of credibility.
It's your word against his.

35:57.054 --> 36:00.217
Well, I'll take that chance.
My credibility's intact.

36:01.792 --> 36:04.590
Isn't it?

36:04.662 --> 36:08.098
- Michael?
- I didn't want to get into this until I could prove otherwise.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.293
What are you talking about?

36:10.368 --> 36:14.668
Stephanie, a routine computer run
shows you got a record.

36:14.739 --> 36:17.674
- What?
- Two arrests in Las Vegas.

36:17.742 --> 36:22.338
That's ridiculous. I've never been
arrested in Las Vegas or anywhere else. I...

36:24.048 --> 36:27.074
What was I supposedly arrested for?

36:29.487 --> 36:31.421
Solicitation.

36:35.993 --> 36:37.927
That's a lie!

36:40.097 --> 36:42.190
How can he do that?

36:43.701 --> 36:46.226
You can prove that's a lie,
can't you?

36:46.304 --> 36:48.238
We're working on it.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.310
Do you believe me?
Oh, yeah, I believe you.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.413
It's the grand jury
that I'm worried about.

36:59.584 --> 37:01.916
Michael, Devon wants you.

37:18.669 --> 37:22.105
Ah, Michael.
I have Stephanie's arrest record.

37:22.173 --> 37:27.372
Listen. "Stephanie Mason,
Las Vegas, June 10, 1982.

37:27.445 --> 37:30.903
"Solicitation. Arresting
Officer, William Donner.

37:30.982 --> 37:34.383
"Las Vegas, July 23, 1982.

37:34.452 --> 37:38.354
Solicitation. Arresting
Officer, William Donner."

37:38.422 --> 37:41.016
The same arresting officer.
That's very interesting.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.026
Yes. Now listen to this.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.324
William Donner.
Ten years on the police force.

37:45.396 --> 37:49.196
Indicted last fall in a police scandal,
but it didn't stick.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.201
Then he disappeared.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.669
And here he is.

37:53.738 --> 37:56.935
Wait a minute.
I've seen this face.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.306
The car that tailed us
to the retreat.

37:59.377 --> 38:01.971
KITT, the visuals on the two men
who tailed us to the retreat.

38:02.046 --> 38:03.980
Patch 'em through.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.812
Right away, Michael.

38:13.524 --> 38:17.187
That's our man, Devon. That's the proof
they salted a phony record on Stephanie.

38:17.261 --> 38:22.028
Wait a minute. This may be enough to
question the veracity on Stephanie's record,

38:22.099 --> 38:24.693
but it doesn't touch Gilbert Cole,
not yet.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.634
What will?
We're running out of time.

38:26.704 --> 38:28.695
I know a way.

38:38.916 --> 38:41.976
Gilbert, it's me, Stephanie.
I need your help.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.419
Where are you now, at home?

38:44.488 --> 38:47.286
No, they've got me at the Foundation.
But I heard them talking.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.986
They're taking me to a retreat,
somewhere in the mountains.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.928
Someone's coming.
I'll try to call you from there.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.408
All right.

39:05.476 --> 39:08.104
No matter what happens,

39:08.179 --> 39:10.113
you stay with KITT.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.908
I will.
Stephanie, promise me.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.948
I promise.
Okay.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.253
Devon's standing by.

39:21.325 --> 39:23.725
All we have to do
is bait the trap.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.629
KITT, scan the cabin.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.397
There's no one inside, Michael.

39:37.575 --> 39:40.567
Michael, I'm a little afraid.
Everything's gonna be all right.

39:40.644 --> 39:43.511
I promise.
He knows what he's talking about.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.550
I certainly hope so.

39:56.127 --> 39:59.324
Michael, a vehicle is approaching
at high speed.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.331
Bingo.

40:15.312 --> 40:17.473
I hit it with everything I got!
Ram him!

40:19.083 --> 40:22.450
- Here they come.
- Surely you don't expect me to just stand here, Michael.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.114
Just one second longer.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.157
Now!

40:32.430 --> 40:34.728
You okay?

40:43.307 --> 40:45.434
Where's Cole? I don't know
what you're talkin' about!

40:45.509 --> 40:47.773
Michael, are you in need
of assistance?

40:47.845 --> 40:50.712
No, just a little privacy!

40:50.781 --> 40:54.547
All right. It's your last chance, man.
Where's Cole?

41:00.524 --> 41:04.153
No call. I checked with the
operator. The car phone's dead.

41:04.228 --> 41:06.526
Something's wrong.
Let's get out of here.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.659
Do you think we'll be in time?

41:11.735 --> 41:13.669
I hope so, buddy.

41:13.737 --> 41:16.831
They're waitin' for a phone call
they're not gonna get.

41:21.378 --> 41:24.472
- Michael, there's a fence ahead.
- No problem, pal.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.403
Can we catch 'em?
No problem, pal.

41:54.645 --> 41:57.443
They're approaching airspeed, Michael.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.710
Yeah, I know.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.514
There's only one way
to stop 'em.

42:07.591 --> 42:10.287
Ready whenever you are, Michael.

42:24.975 --> 42:27.136
Way to go, pal.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.145
As usual.

42:33.617 --> 42:35.551
Usually, I'd wait for you
to swing first.

42:35.619 --> 42:37.553
But...

42:42.927 --> 42:45.691
I talked to the federal attorney.

42:45.763 --> 42:48.994
He said that after I testify,

42:49.066 --> 42:52.297
I'll be in the witness relocation
program.

42:52.369 --> 42:56.635
New place to live.
New identity.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.173
Sometimes it doesn't seem
like any of this ever happened.

43:02.780 --> 43:05.214
Well, it's all behind you now.

43:05.282 --> 43:07.750
The nightmare is over.

43:07.818 --> 43:09.752
And the dream?

43:11.689 --> 43:14.522
Hey, what happened?
You lose your necklace?

43:15.526 --> 43:17.460
No. I gave it back.

43:22.066 --> 43:25.467
It's gonna be strange
becoming somebody else.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.967
Leaving my life behind.

43:32.710 --> 43:37.409
You know, I read about
a bird once a long time ago.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.112
A white bird.

43:42.186 --> 43:45.747
It eats, sleeps,

43:45.823 --> 43:49.020
spends its entire life
in flight.

43:50.427 --> 43:52.361
It never lands.

43:53.764 --> 43:55.698
That's its purpose.

43:56.900 --> 43:58.834
Its destiny.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.038
To fly forever.

44:21.592 --> 44:23.526
Good-bye, Michael.

44:26.196 --> 44:28.892
Good-bye, Stevie.

45:49.113 --> 45:51.172
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

45:51.248 --> 45:53.739
Name it. Anything.

45:55.319 --> 45:58.220
All right.
What do you want me to do?

45:58.288 --> 46:00.916
It's not within your power.

46:00.991 --> 46:04.017
I didn't know they were gonna
shoot up the place.

46:05.763 --> 46:09.460
Do you know what that was?
A 150-year-old clock.

46:09.533 --> 46:12.730
Oh, here.
Maybe I can fix it.

46:19.576 --> 46:22.340
I guess not.

46:22.412 --> 46:24.710
I'm gonna take a little drive.
It's really nice outside.

46:24.782 --> 46:28.718
I'll come back in about an hour or so
when you've added up all the damages.

46:56.914 --> 46:59.109
What is it, Michael?

47:01.151 --> 47:03.244
I wonder if she really knew, KITT.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.016
Look in the glove compartment.

47:22.606 --> 47:24.870
Why did she leave it for you?

47:29.046 --> 47:31.708
A mutual friend gave this to her...

47:31.782 --> 47:33.875
a long time ago.

47:35.485 --> 47:37.419
He's dead now.

47:40.057 --> 47:42.685
I think she wanted me
to remember him with this.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.852
What was his name?

47:50.834 --> 47:52.768
Michael Long, KITT.

47:55.772 --> 47:57.706
Michael Long.
