Got to do it. Sorry.

Be there in an hour.

01:06.771 --> 01:09.677
A mind‐blowing part
of this whole experience

01:09.677 --> 01:10.946
is that when I was little,

01:10.946 --> 01:13.785

What's really cool about
the song that I am singing,

01:36.029 --> 01:39.937
"Anyone" by Demi Lovato,
is that when I was 12,

01:39.937 --> 01:43.678
I was really starting to
struggle with my mental health.

01:43.678 --> 01:45.882
But I saw what Demi was doing

01:45.882 --> 01:49.122
and how they were sharing
their struggles so publicly.

01:49.122 --> 01:53.598

Oh, my gosh, hi.
I'm so excited to see you

03:50.030 --> 03:52.401
and Kelly.
And maybe possibly me?
Okay, cool.

03:52.401 --> 03:53.871
Yes, definitely.

03:53.871 --> 03:55.040
Just say
there's a chance.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.044
What's your name?
I am Ryleigh Plank.

03:57.044 --> 04:00.752
I am 20 years old, and I am
from Fort Myers, Florida.

04:00.752 --> 04:02.288
Yeah, let's go, Florida.

04:02.288 --> 04:04.894
Florida. She really is
excited to see you.

04:04.894 --> 04:06.396
Hey, Kelly,
she gave her this.

04:06.396 --> 04:09.202
I know.
Little sassy finger.

04:09.202 --> 04:13.343
Florida.
Oh, my God.
This keeps happening.

04:13.343 --> 04:15.414
This is so crazy
because I grew up

04:15.414 --> 04:17.519
singing your songs
as a little kid.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.255
Oh, you are kind.
Same with Ariana.

04:19.255 --> 04:21.192
You guys have helped me
get to where I am,

04:21.192 --> 04:24.299
so it's really amazing
to be here.

04:25.434 --> 04:27.371
Since I was 6 or 7,

04:27.371 --> 04:30.010
I was like,
"I am going to be a rock star."

04:30.010 --> 04:36.189
And I didn't want to necessarily
go to college, be in debt.

04:36.189 --> 04:38.427
I just wanted
to chase my dream.

04:38.427 --> 04:41.399
So I started creating
my own music.

04:41.399 --> 04:45.976
I do write all of my own songs
and I make demos at my home.

04:45.976 --> 04:50.317
Music is my life,
and as cliche as it may sound,

04:50.317 --> 04:51.887
it definitely was something

04:51.887 --> 04:55.060
that helped pull me
out of the trenches.

04:55.060 --> 04:58.400
Growing up was kind of difficult
for me.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.471
When I was about 9,

05:00.471 --> 05:02.809
my mom and dad
had gotten divorced.

05:02.809 --> 05:07.953
I didn't have many friends and
struggled a lot with bullying.

05:07.953 --> 05:11.861
I think that really set me
on a tailspin.

05:11.861 --> 05:15.869
I just started struggling
insanely with depression,

05:15.869 --> 05:19.910
but I would hide it
like nobody's business.

05:19.910 --> 05:22.481
And I think it was
a defensive mechanism, you know?

05:22.481 --> 05:25.955
If they don't know,
then maybe it's not so bad

05:25.955 --> 05:28.393
or something silly like that.

05:28.393 --> 05:31.399
Having experienced
depression and anxiety,

05:31.399 --> 05:35.240
it sometimes does become hard
to believe in yourself.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.246
But now that I have
stepped out of high school

05:38.246 --> 05:41.386
and really allowed myself
to be who I am,

05:41.386 --> 05:44.492
I have discovered
that this doesn't define me.

05:44.492 --> 05:48.935
So being here
is an amazing realization

05:48.935 --> 05:50.905
of how far I've come.

05:50.905 --> 05:52.976
You brought me to tears.

05:52.976 --> 05:56.282
I was welling up.
I felt that so deeply.

05:56.282 --> 05:57.986
It was so beautiful,
and I could tell

05:57.986 --> 05:59.957
that you were singing
from a really real place.

05:59.957 --> 06:02.395
Your vibrato can
become quite wide

06:02.395 --> 06:04.065
and it's beautiful
and it's stunning.

06:04.065 --> 06:05.935
But there were moments
where it was a little sharp.

06:05.935 --> 06:07.405
I think it was
probably just nerves,

06:07.405 --> 06:09.308
but I think I would be able
to help with that.

06:09.308 --> 06:10.879
And it was really moving.

06:10.879 --> 06:12.114
I could tell that
that came from somewhere.

06:12.114 --> 06:13.951
Thank you.
Ryleigh,

06:13.951 --> 06:16.156
it's such
a challenging song to do,

06:16.156 --> 06:19.630
and you had
a few execution issues,

06:19.630 --> 06:21.299
but that's what coaching
is for.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.971
You're already really talented,
and I look forward

06:23.971 --> 06:25.942
to what you're gonna do
next on the show.

06:25.942 --> 06:28.046
Thank you, John.
Thank you.

06:30.317 --> 06:31.554
Ryleigh...
Yes.

06:31.554 --> 06:33.023
Does Kelly
have a chance?

06:33.023 --> 06:35.294
Yes! Kelly will always
have a chance.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.899
Okay.
I love Kelly,
so of course.

06:37.899 --> 06:39.903
Of course!
We all ‐‐
We all love her,

06:39.903 --> 06:41.373
except when we're competing
against her.

06:41.373 --> 06:43.410
Just in those moments.

06:43.410 --> 06:45.013
Just wanted to say to you,

06:45.013 --> 06:47.552
once I saw these two were
turning around for you,

06:47.552 --> 06:49.556
then it's like,
"Okay, these are the two

06:49.556 --> 06:51.326
that need to be
with this artist,"

06:51.326 --> 06:54.031
so I stayed out of it,
but congratulations.

06:54.031 --> 06:55.935
Who cares?
Who do you pick as your coach?

06:57.506 --> 07:00.110
Let Kelly talk.

07:00.110 --> 07:01.312
At least just let me
say something.

07:01.312 --> 07:02.949
Because here's the thing ‐‐
I turned, like,

07:02.949 --> 07:05.020
light years before her,
but it's fine.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.425
First of all,
you look rad as hell.

07:07.425 --> 07:09.930
Thank you.
Like, I love your whole vibe.

07:12.001 --> 07:13.971
I mean, it's such a cool vibe.
Thanks.

07:13.971 --> 07:15.474
And I think your voice
is incredible,

07:15.474 --> 07:17.679
and I've navigated...

07:17.679 --> 07:20.084
Hey!
Oh.

07:20.084 --> 07:22.021
They have to cheers every time
I say "navigated."

07:22.021 --> 07:24.560
I was like,
"What is happening?"

07:24.560 --> 07:25.962
I've navigated
a competition,

07:25.962 --> 07:27.231
so I feel like
I could help you do it.

07:27.231 --> 07:30.437
I know that the obvious choice
here is ‐‐

07:30.437 --> 07:32.475
I mean, I know you're like,
"Yeah, Florida."

07:32.475 --> 07:33.611
I've been to Florida,

07:33.611 --> 07:35.715
made a horrible movie
in Florida.

07:35.715 --> 07:37.619
I want to watch.

07:37.619 --> 07:39.188
"From Justin to Kelly."

07:39.188 --> 07:40.592
I'm just saying ‐‐
That movie's a classic.

07:40.592 --> 07:42.529
What the hell kind of a movie
did you make?

07:42.529 --> 07:44.398
What kind of movie?
That movie's iconic.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.002
What kind of ‐‐
What kind of things

07:46.002 --> 07:48.006
you're ashamed of in Florida
that you do?

07:48.006 --> 07:49.610
No, this jacket, wouldn't it
look cute on you?

07:49.610 --> 07:51.981
That's stylish.

07:51.981 --> 07:53.049
I'm just saying.

07:53.049 --> 07:54.520
I don't know.
I'm just saying.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.158
If we are bribing
and luring with gifts,

07:57.158 --> 08:00.364
might I introduce you
to my lunch box

08:00.364 --> 08:03.604
that contains
local health supplies...

08:03.604 --> 08:05.040
Ooh.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.309
Yeah, yeah.

08:06.309 --> 08:09.382
...that will not only treat
but prevent

08:09.382 --> 08:11.654
fatigue or swelling
of the vocal cords.

08:11.654 --> 08:13.390
So just think about it.

08:13.390 --> 08:16.296
Because Ariana didn't think
you sounded well when you sang.

08:17.464 --> 08:20.672
Blake Shelton!

08:20.672 --> 08:25.013
Anyway, I really think
that you could win this thing.

08:25.013 --> 08:26.617

as your coach?

08:26.617 --> 08:28.186

What just happened?

10:29.529 --> 10:31.099
What's up?

10:39.816 --> 10:42.221
♪ This is "The Voice"Welcome back to
the blind auditions.

10:42.221 --> 10:44.125
Okay, stand by, folks.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.460
Kelly, try to get somebody.

10:45.460 --> 10:47.131
You know what?

10:47.131 --> 10:48.868
I think she's navigating this
just fine.

10:48.868 --> 10:51.607
Navigating ‐‐ you guys got me
saying it now.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.678
So Blake and Ariana
have decided

10:53.678 --> 10:55.882
that Kelly says
"navigate" a lot.

10:55.882 --> 10:58.688
It's really a good thing
to be able to navigate

10:58.688 --> 11:00.490
in all those little colors
of your voice.

11:00.490 --> 11:03.363
I've navigated...
Hey!

11:03.363 --> 11:06.436
I know how to navigate
a competition.

11:06.436 --> 11:10.477
And they've started
a little clinking game.

11:10.477 --> 11:11.780
I think Kelly's trying

11:11.780 --> 11:14.786
to navigate
her way into a thesaurus.

11:14.786 --> 11:16.189
You're navigating
the competition.

11:16.189 --> 11:17.291
What are you
supposed to say?

11:17.291 --> 11:19.161
No, I said it too.
Yeah.

11:19.161 --> 11:20.464
It's the right word.

11:20.464 --> 11:21.834
That's the word you use.

11:21.834 --> 11:23.504
Like, what is the other ‐‐

11:23.504 --> 11:26.175
I mean, fine. I'll look up
some synonyms for navigate.

11:26.175 --> 11:27.946
What,
do I have to dumb it down?

11:27.946 --> 11:29.950
Read a book.

11:29.950 --> 11:33.456
My name is Jershika Maple.
I live in Killeen, Texas,

11:33.456 --> 11:35.928
and I am from Shreveport,
Louisiana.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.866
I'm literally here
on "The Voice."

11:37.866 --> 11:40.203
Like, what? That's crazy.

11:40.203 --> 11:41.472
When I'm not singing,

11:41.472 --> 11:43.944
I work as a security guard
at a tech company.

11:43.944 --> 11:45.515
It's kind of like TSA.

11:45.515 --> 11:48.587
I'm in my uniform
and people are walking through.

11:48.587 --> 11:49.856
I'm obviously observing,

11:49.856 --> 11:51.860
making sure
there's nothing suspicious.

11:51.860 --> 11:53.931
And they go through
metal detectors.

11:53.931 --> 11:56.637
I have to wand them
if they have any metals on them.

11:56.637 --> 11:58.239
I power with the wand.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.676
They don't want to
get wanded by me. No.

12:01.479 --> 12:04.285
But it's not something
that I am passionate about.

12:04.285 --> 12:07.324
That is not something
I want to be doing forever.

12:07.324 --> 12:09.361
Singing is my passion,
has always been,

12:09.361 --> 12:13.904
and I am now looking forward
to go into that direction.

12:13.904 --> 12:16.844
I saw Rose Short
on season 17 of "The Voice."

12:16.844 --> 12:19.482
Who do you pick
as your coach, Rose?

12:19.482 --> 12:20.752
Gwen Stefani.

12:22.221 --> 12:24.458
Rose Short,
you're in the finale.

12:24.458 --> 12:26.530
I'd been to
a couple of gigs that she had

12:26.530 --> 12:27.899
and I was a fan of hers.

12:27.899 --> 12:30.538
She reached out
to have background singers,

12:30.538 --> 12:32.942
and I made it
on her Rose Short tour.

12:32.942 --> 12:34.780
We just instantly connected.

12:34.780 --> 12:38.319
Watching Rose on "The Voice"
was definitely inspiring.

12:38.319 --> 12:40.825
That's exactly why I'm here.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.898
Rose!
Surprise!

12:43.898 --> 12:45.367
I'm so happy for you.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.404
And, baby, them chairs

12:47.404 --> 12:49.743

I love you.
I'm proud of you.

12:49.743 --> 12:51.713
Thank you, Rose.
Ohh.

12:51.713 --> 12:54.418
Rose did encourage me
to audition for "The Voice."

12:54.418 --> 12:55.888
And I was like,
"You know what?

12:55.888 --> 12:58.928
2020 was a year of
all hell breaking loose."

12:58.928 --> 13:00.531
And I was like,
"I'm just gonna go out

electric,
exciting performance.

15:41.553 --> 15:45.427
You hit those immensely
challenging high notes.

15:45.427 --> 15:49.936
Yeah.
And I would be so happy

18:58.146 --> 19:00.083
I'm a huge Ariana Grande fan,

be a coach on this season.

Music has been, like,
a part of my household.

19:15.648 --> 19:19.889
My dad is a musician.
My mom was a dancer.

19:19.889 --> 19:21.893
She sang in the choir.

19:21.893 --> 19:25.433
But I didn't start singing
until I was 14 years old.

19:25.433 --> 19:28.707
I was a very shy kid
and very introverted,

19:28.707 --> 19:33.684
pretty scrawny, pretty cute,
but I was very shy.

19:33.684 --> 19:36.890
In middle school,
I joined a dance team.

19:36.890 --> 19:39.896
You know, that wasn't
the most popular thing at school

19:39.896 --> 19:42.869
because it was like,
"Oh, guys, they play sports,"

19:42.869 --> 19:44.672
and I was dancing.

19:44.672 --> 19:46.676
But my mom would encourage me,

19:46.676 --> 19:49.214
and ‐‐ and that's when
I started singing.

19:49.214 --> 19:51.686
It became really a passion.

19:51.686 --> 19:54.859
My mom was one
of my biggest cheerleaders,

19:54.859 --> 19:58.867
and I wouldn't be here today
had it not been for her.

19:58.867 --> 20:02.374
It was during the summer
of 2012, and my dad,

20:02.374 --> 20:04.879
he told us
that my mom was sick.

20:04.879 --> 20:11.693
And in 2017,
she passed away from cancer.

20:11.693 --> 20:16.068
It was one of the hardest things
I've ever experienced.

20:16.068 --> 20:17.838
You know, it ‐‐
it took a while for me

20:17.838 --> 20:21.111
to be able to talk about it
because it's such a tragic

20:21.111 --> 20:22.715
and it's a heavy thing.

20:22.715 --> 20:24.852
But I will say that
I'm so grateful

20:24.852 --> 20:28.760

Yes! Yes!

22:58.292 --> 23:00.229
Hello. Welcome.
Hey.

23:00.229 --> 23:02.500
Hi. What's your name?
Where are you from?

23:02.500 --> 23:03.870
My name is Manny Keith.

23:03.870 --> 23:06.241
I'm 31 years old.
I'm from Miami, Florida.

23:06.241 --> 23:08.212
Right on.
Miami.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.016
You really do have
a lovely voice,

23:10.016 --> 23:12.922
and it feels very inviting
and welcoming.

23:12.922 --> 23:15.561
I'm so excited
that you're on "The Voice."

23:15.561 --> 23:18.099
Welcome.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

23:19.602 --> 23:21.038
Very nice to meet you.

23:21.038 --> 23:22.942
I'm a fellow Floridian.
I'm from Boca.

23:22.942 --> 23:25.581
I just got to say
I am a huge,

23:25.581 --> 23:28.119
the biggest
Ariana Grande fan ever.

23:28.119 --> 23:29.989
No!

23:29.989 --> 23:31.392
I'm sorry you have to be
on Team Blake.

23:31.392 --> 23:32.962
Oh, my gosh, no.

23:32.962 --> 23:35.233
No, I'm just honored
to be here with all of you.

23:35.233 --> 23:37.137
I was already sorry that you had
to be on Team Blake,

23:37.137 --> 23:39.007
but now I'm doubly sorry.
No, I'm kidding.

23:39.007 --> 23:41.011
I'm kidding.
You have a really cool voice,

23:41.011 --> 23:42.581
and I'm excited to hear you
sing more songs.

23:42.581 --> 23:44.384
There were moments of your tone
that reminded me

23:44.384 --> 23:45.486
of JC from NSYNC.

23:45.486 --> 23:47.157
Oh,
I love JC from NSYNC.

23:47.157 --> 23:49.161
Yeah, is that why
you hit yours too?

23:49.161 --> 23:50.463
Yeah, uh, who?

23:50.463 --> 23:52.100
You don't know
who that is.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.471
Yeah, he's a big JC Chasez
fan as well.

23:54.471 --> 23:56.509
Oh, I thought you said Sade.
No.

23:56.509 --> 23:58.079
I thought you sounded
really amazing.

23:58.079 --> 23:59.549
Hopefully,
I'll have the opportunity

23:59.549 --> 24:00.984
to steal you at some point.

24:00.984 --> 24:03.122
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

24:03.122 --> 24:07.163
Hey, Manny, you say you're
the biggest Ariana Grande fan.

24:07.163 --> 24:07.998
I am, yeah.

24:07.998 --> 24:10.136
Okay, I just want to ‐‐
I mean...

24:12.040 --> 24:14.478
Are you gonna take this?
There is someone here.

24:14.478 --> 24:16.616
Are you gonna take this?

24:16.616 --> 24:19.722
You're ‐‐ You're just gonna
take it. Okay.

24:19.722 --> 24:21.726
You have some challengers
in the audience

24:21.726 --> 24:23.362
for biggest Ariana fan.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.734
God, that was
a nice callback.

24:25.734 --> 24:27.137
I'm so mad
I didn't hit my thing.

24:27.137 --> 24:28.673
Sorry. Go on.
Sorry. Go on, go on.

24:28.673 --> 24:30.376
That's ‐‐ You know,
it's interesting because...

24:30.376 --> 24:31.646
Rub it in.
...there was a moment

24:31.646 --> 24:33.382
Ariana looked over at me
and she was like...

24:33.382 --> 24:34.685
"He's really good."
I said that.

24:34.685 --> 24:36.388
"What are you gonna do?
He's really good."

24:36.388 --> 24:37.691
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

24:37.691 --> 24:39.461
And I was like,
and at that moment, I was like,

24:39.461 --> 24:40.531
"Bring it on."
Hit my button.

24:40.531 --> 24:41.566
And I think I scared her.

24:41.566 --> 24:43.402
I think
she was intimidated.

24:43.402 --> 24:46.976
Anyway, Manny, I think
you're an incredible singer.

24:46.976 --> 24:49.982
I think you may have been
in John Legend's closet

24:49.982 --> 24:52.220
picking out some of his jackets
and shirts and stuff.

24:52.220 --> 24:55.226
That's a compliment.
That's a compliment.
Yeah.

24:55.226 --> 24:57.497
People have thought
that I was you with my mask on.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.000
They keep getting us confused.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.205
I might be your long‐lost
brother, just saying.

25:01.205 --> 25:02.975
We're related.

25:02.975 --> 25:04.645
But he does have
the cowboy boots on.

25:04.645 --> 25:06.215
Yes.
I like it a lot.

25:06.215 --> 25:08.687
Anyway, man,
you're stuck with the loser‐y

25:08.687 --> 25:12.026
eight‐time champion
of "The Voice."

25:12.026 --> 25:15.333
Welcome to Team Blake.
Thank you so much.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.569
Manny's a great performer.

25:16.569 --> 25:18.205
I mean,
he was all over the stage.

25:18.205 --> 25:20.544
He's an entertainer,
and I love that energy.

25:20.544 --> 25:22.113
I love his voice.

25:22.113 --> 25:23.550
Hey, come on,
we got to brag.

25:23.550 --> 25:25.486
I only have two spots
left on my team.

25:25.486 --> 25:27.023
It's a little bit
all over the map.

25:27.023 --> 25:28.459
And that's exciting to me,
though,

25:28.459 --> 25:30.263
because the more
different styles

25:30.263 --> 25:32.267
and different kinds of artists
I can work with,

25:32.267 --> 25:33.537
the more I grow also.

25:33.537 --> 25:36.676
You see that America?
Take that!

25:36.676 --> 25:37.778
Manny!

25:37.778 --> 25:40.249
Hey, go ‐‐ you got to go
meet Ariana.

25:40.249 --> 25:41.786
Manny....
Oh, my gosh.

25:41.786 --> 25:43.355
...I'm super bummed
that I didn't turn for him.

25:43.355 --> 25:45.092
He has such a good voice.

25:45.092 --> 25:46.596
I would love
to steal him later.

25:46.596 --> 25:48.265
I think
he's super talented.

25:48.265 --> 25:49.267
What did that hug feel like?

25:49.267 --> 25:51.038
Honestly, after COVID,

25:51.038 --> 25:52.775
and Ariana is the first person
I get to hug,

25:52.775 --> 25:54.712
it's like, "What?
This is crazy."

25:54.712 --> 25:56.448
Loser‐y.

25:56.448 --> 25:58.185
Loser‐y coach.

25:58.185 --> 26:00.089
If you can spell that word,

26:00.089 --> 26:01.593
I'll give you
whatever you want.

26:23.269 --> 26:25.239
Hey, guys. Blake,
how you feeling about your team?

26:25.239 --> 26:28.345
Man, I feel good. I've got
a little bit of everything.

26:28.345 --> 26:30.784
I've got the right
country artist

26:30.784 --> 26:33.757
that made the right decisions
along the way.

26:33.757 --> 26:35.192
I'm liking how my team's
shaping up.

26:35.192 --> 26:36.428
I don't care how I get them.
That's good.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.365
I understand.
Don't care how I get them.

26:38.365 --> 26:41.271
Ariana, do you and Blake
have a rivalry?

26:41.271 --> 26:44.244
Because sometimes
I see you guys toasting.

26:44.244 --> 26:46.081
I think sometimes
it's a friendship

26:46.081 --> 26:48.085
and sometimes it is
an absolute feud.

26:48.085 --> 26:49.789
I think Blake is
just opportunistic.

26:49.789 --> 26:51.091
Good point.

26:51.091 --> 26:52.293
Yeah,
let's point that out.

26:52.293 --> 26:53.863
Good luck today.
Thank you, Carson.

26:53.863 --> 26:55.366
All right.

26:58.773 --> 27:01.144
I'm really nervous
for my audition.

27:01.144 --> 27:04.250
This journey has definitely
been challenging.

27:04.250 --> 27:07.725
I was in a boy band.
We were signed to a label.

27:07.725 --> 27:09.762
I was a kid.
I really felt like,

27:09.762 --> 27:11.532
"Wow, I can't believe
this is my life."

27:11.532 --> 27:14.170
We came out with a few singles
and a few videos,

27:14.170 --> 27:16.241
but nothing ever
really took off.

27:16.241 --> 27:18.713
After that,
it kind of took all of me

27:18.713 --> 27:20.149
to get myself back up
to feel like

27:20.149 --> 27:22.788
I was good enough
to do music again.

27:22.788 --> 27:24.157
My name is Austin Percario.

27:29.401 --> 27:31.673

audition for the show this year

27:31.673 --> 27:32.875

27:32.875 --> 27:34.879
Ariana Grande
is such a superstar.

27:34.879 --> 27:37.785
She knows how to bring
confidence to the table.

27:37.785 --> 27:39.321
And throughout my entire life,

27:39.321 --> 27:41.358
I've fought
believing in myself.

27:41.358 --> 27:43.429
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. Ahh!

27:43.429 --> 27:44.932
Any of these coaches
turning around

27:44.932 --> 27:47.170
would give me a push

We're so happy to have you.

29:17.851 --> 29:19.387
Were you a little bit nervous,
maybe?

29:19.387 --> 29:21.258
Yeah, I think
I was pretty nervous.

29:21.258 --> 29:23.262
I could hear
a tiny bit of nerves,

29:23.262 --> 29:24.732
a tiny bit of distress.

29:24.732 --> 29:26.034
But I do love your voice.

29:26.034 --> 29:27.638
I wish you had chosen
a different song

29:27.638 --> 29:29.441
because it kind of lies
in that one spot the whole time.

29:29.441 --> 29:31.946
And I got a little taste
of what more you had

29:31.946 --> 29:34.785
to offer at the end, but it took
a while to get there.

29:34.785 --> 29:36.455
May have been
as simple as

29:36.455 --> 29:39.394
you raising the key
to a different place.

29:39.394 --> 29:42.300
Mm‐hmm.
This had you living in
a lower part of your voice,

29:42.300 --> 29:45.306
and when you are nervous,
we can hear the shake down there

29:45.306 --> 29:46.776
in the bottom of your voice.
Yeah, yeah.

29:46.776 --> 29:47.911
I think
you have the ability

29:47.911 --> 29:49.515
to do a really great
audition for us,

29:49.515 --> 29:51.886
and I think just making
a couple different choices

29:51.886 --> 29:53.590
might actually get you
to that place.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.660
Thank you so much.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.497
Hi, Austin.
Hi.

29:57.497 --> 29:58.933
First of all,
I love your tone.

29:58.933 --> 30:00.670
I literally said it as soon
as you started singing.

30:00.670 --> 30:03.308
That was like when
I'm watching, like, a show

30:03.308 --> 30:05.312
and there's
this beautiful scene,

30:05.312 --> 30:07.551
that's the song, and you're
the voice singing right then.

30:07.551 --> 30:08.285
Yeah. "Grey's Anatomy."

30:08.285 --> 30:10.289
Like, it felt like a very ‐‐
Yeah.

30:10.289 --> 30:11.659
It felt like a very...

30:11.659 --> 30:13.830
Someone's open.

30:13.830 --> 30:15.634
And you're like...

30:15.634 --> 30:16.936
Someone's under the knife.

30:16.936 --> 30:19.073
No, I just meant, like,
I really love your voice.

30:19.073 --> 30:20.877
Thank you so much.
Yeah, it's really cool.

30:20.877 --> 30:22.346
Thank you.

30:22.346 --> 30:23.983
Thank you so much, Austin.
Thank you, Austin.

30:23.983 --> 30:25.687
Austin has a nice tone.

30:25.687 --> 30:28.560
I just think he didn't execute
it the way he needed to today.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.329
My team is almost full.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.870

that just makes me need

30:33.870 --> 30:35.372
to push my button
and turn around.

30:38.546 --> 30:39.515
I'm KJ Jennings.

30:39.515 --> 30:42.654
I'm 21 years old
and I'm from Austin, Texas.

30:44.992 --> 30:47.798
I love to wakesurf
with my family.

30:47.798 --> 30:52.674
We're bonding and laughing and
competing against each other.

30:54.477 --> 30:56.749
And that's one of my favorite
activities ever

30:56.749 --> 30:59.387
is you put on a great
classic rock playlist

30:59.387 --> 31:02.059
and you wakesurf until
you can't feel your legs.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.499
Ready.

31:07.370 --> 31:11.646
Growing up in Texas
was extremely fun and muddy,

31:11.646 --> 31:16.054
and I was so blessed
to have parents that raised us

31:16.054 --> 31:19.093
in such a creative
and active household.

31:19.093 --> 31:23.035
From dirt biking,
wakesurfing, beekeeping...

31:23.035 --> 31:24.572
‐Yay.
‐Look at that.

31:24.572 --> 31:27.911
...all of these
adrenaline‐inducing activities

31:27.911 --> 31:29.414
were so incredible

31:29.414 --> 31:32.621
because they prepared me
for the stage.

31:32.621 --> 31:35.159
The moment I knew
I wanted to be a performer,

31:35.159 --> 31:39.133
I was 6 years old, and I
was watching my mom perform

31:39.133 --> 31:41.404
in the musical "Guys and Dolls."

31:41.404 --> 31:44.912
As soon as she came out
on stage, that was it.

31:44.912 --> 31:46.782
I was mesmerized,

31:46.782 --> 31:50.422
so I really started
to dive into theater

31:50.422 --> 31:53.897
and discovered my love for jazz.

31:53.897 --> 31:56.067
I attended Berklee College
of Music

31:56.067 --> 31:57.671
to study jazz performance there

31:57.671 --> 32:00.175
because I wanted to do
what my mom did.

32:00.175 --> 32:03.448
The song I'm singing
for my blind audition ‐‐

32:03.448 --> 32:04.919
and, Mom,
you're gonna know it ‐‐

32:04.919 --> 32:06.555
it's the one that we would belt

32:06.555 --> 32:08.425
every time
we would cook together.

32:08.425 --> 32:10.429
"Put Your Records On"
by Corinne Bailey Rae.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.832
Would you like me
to sing it?

32:11.832 --> 32:14.805
I know, that's the song
that I ‐‐ I'm gonna sing.

32:14.805 --> 32:16.007
I'll get that microphone.

32:16.007 --> 32:17.711
With our wooden spoons.

32:17.711 --> 32:20.584
There's nothing better
than being in this moment

32:20.584 --> 32:25.827
than I am right now as a parent
to see your children thrive.

32:25.827 --> 32:28.465
But the thing that has
been so incredible to see

32:28.465 --> 32:31.839
is that she took that talent
and married it

32:31.839 --> 32:35.847
with this just
incredible courage.

32:35.847 --> 32:39.622
I am just
extremely proud of KJ.

32:41.592 --> 32:45.466
I am here to be pushed
to a higher level

32:45.466 --> 32:47.971
and turn my passion
into something

32:47.971 --> 32:50.442
that I can use as a career.

32:50.442 --> 32:53.115
To be able to turn a chair
for my family,

32:53.115 --> 32:56.454
it would just mean
that all my hard work

32:56.454 --> 32:59.695
and their hard work
to support me has paid off.

32:59.695 --> 33:02.734
This could change
all of our lives, not just mine,

33:02.734 --> 33:05.239
because I truly believe
that this experience

33:05.239 --> 33:09.247
is about serving
and supporting my family,

33:09.247 --> 33:11.886
and I wouldn't be here
without them

33:11.886 --> 33:15.092
and I ‐‐ I wouldn't be who I am
without them.

35:20.242 --> 35:23.215
Hi. What's your name?
Where are you from?

35:23.215 --> 35:25.018
Okay.

35:25.018 --> 35:27.824
Hi. I'm KJ Jennings.
I'm 21 years old.

35:27.824 --> 35:30.964
I'm from Austin, Texas,
but I just moved to L. A.

35:30.964 --> 35:34.203
Welcome to Los Angeles.
Thank you.

35:34.203 --> 35:36.909
Well, hello, KJ.
Hello.

35:36.909 --> 35:41.384
I love Austin. That happens to
be my favorite city in Texas.

35:41.384 --> 35:42.888
Yeah, good.
For a lot of reasons.

35:42.888 --> 35:45.760
Don't try and be Texan.
Don't try and be Texan.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.329
I just think you have
a cool voice.

35:47.329 --> 35:49.200
I think it's very floaty.
Thank you.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.637
There was one run
that you did

35:50.637 --> 35:52.006
towards the first
half of the song

35:52.006 --> 35:54.177
where you went down
and we were all like, "Whoa."

35:54.177 --> 35:56.682
So I know that
all that stuff is there.

35:56.682 --> 35:58.118
And once you
get past the nerves

35:58.118 --> 35:59.253
and you can shake
that stuff off...

35:59.253 --> 36:00.824
Yeah.
...it's gonna be killer.

36:00.824 --> 36:03.395
You look like a star.
I mean, this is meant to be.

36:03.395 --> 36:08.773
Pick me, pick me.
Come on, KJ.

36:08.773 --> 36:10.242
I loved your performance.

36:10.242 --> 36:12.046
It was really beautiful.
I love your tone.

36:12.046 --> 36:13.415
I loved your choices.

36:13.415 --> 36:15.052
I did hear the nerves
a tiny bit,

36:15.052 --> 36:16.287
but I think
it will go away.

36:16.287 --> 36:18.291
I'm excited to hear
more from you.

36:18.291 --> 36:19.828
Welcome to "The Voice."
Thank you so much.

36:19.828 --> 36:23.301
Thank you.
Oh, my gosh.

36:23.301 --> 36:25.305
KJ.
Hi.

36:25.305 --> 36:26.942
I turned around for you
quickly

36:26.942 --> 36:30.382
because I found it so charming
and so inviting.
Thank you.

36:30.382 --> 36:34.090
I feel like you're
an adventurous singer,

36:34.090 --> 36:35.693
and I feel like
you're bringing

36:35.693 --> 36:38.733
that jazz sensibility
to pop music.

36:38.733 --> 36:41.739
I heard some Amy Winehouse vibes
a couple times.

36:41.739 --> 36:43.676
I love playing jazz...
Yeah.

36:43.676 --> 36:45.078
...and my Christmas albums
are like an ode

36:45.078 --> 36:46.414
to all those singers
that I love

36:46.414 --> 36:48.018
like Nat King Cole
and Ella

36:48.018 --> 36:51.024
and all those singers
that are my biggest influences.

36:51.024 --> 36:52.226
I love what you're doing,

36:52.226 --> 36:53.696
and I think it's really fun
to watch.

36:53.696 --> 36:56.234
You bring such light
and energy to the stage.

36:56.234 --> 36:58.940
You just look like you love
doing what you're doing.

36:58.940 --> 37:01.244
This is the dream.
I just ‐‐ I can't even believe

37:01.244 --> 37:02.881
I'm standing here,
you know what I mean?

37:02.881 --> 37:04.183
Well,
we're happy you're here,

37:04.183 --> 37:07.356
and I would love
to be your coach, KJ.

37:07.356 --> 37:09.260
Whew.

37:09.260 --> 37:13.134
All right,
so, KJ, you have a choice.

37:13.134 --> 37:15.272
Who do you pick
as your coach?

37:17.343 --> 37:18.378
Come on.

37:18.378 --> 37:22.453
I'm so honored
that both of you turned for me.

37:22.453 --> 37:25.994
I would love to pick
Team John.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.866
Yes!

37:30.269 --> 37:33.174
I'm so happy! Yes!

37:33.174 --> 37:34.745
KJ's so cool.

37:34.745 --> 37:37.449
She brings a lot of charisma
and energy to the stage.

37:37.449 --> 37:40.222
So fun to listen to,
so fun to watch.

37:40.222 --> 37:42.393
And I had to fight
for her with Blake.

37:42.393 --> 37:43.996
I have
a special gift for you.

37:43.996 --> 37:48.071
But I won, so I decided
I would label my phone

37:48.071 --> 37:49.373
"John's Win Cam,"

37:49.373 --> 37:50.743
because what's
the difference between that

37:50.743 --> 37:52.847
and Blake's win cam?
No difference.

37:52.847 --> 37:54.885
Let's take a selfie...
Oh, yes.
I would love to.

37:54.885 --> 37:56.287
on John's win cam.

37:56.287 --> 37:58.960
Oh, my gosh.
John's win cam was hilarious.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.331
I mean, Blake's thing
is just a camera.

38:01.331 --> 38:03.936
Like,
any camera could be a win cam.

38:03.936 --> 38:05.807
It matches your white.

38:05.807 --> 38:07.777
Whoo! Let's go!

38:10.082 --> 38:12.186
Whoo! Team John, baby!

38:12.186 --> 38:16.394
I think it looks pretty good.

38:16.394 --> 38:19.835
It's a camera.
John's win cam.

38:19.835 --> 38:22.272
It's really special.

38:22.272 --> 38:24.176
I got to say, John's win cam,

38:24.176 --> 38:25.412
that was pretty damn funny.

38:25.412 --> 38:26.915
I got to give him credit.

38:26.915 --> 38:29.888
He's not a funny guy,
but that was funny.

38:31.424 --> 38:33.562
My team is so diverse right now.

38:33.562 --> 38:35.933
We've got such a range
of different talent.

38:35.933 --> 38:38.939
Now I'm looking for artists
who have a point of view,

38:38.939 --> 38:42.279
great tone, who execute
their songs really well.

39:02.453 --> 39:04.023
I love that song.

39:04.023 --> 39:06.595
It's such a classic,
and I was just in a good mood

39:06.595 --> 39:08.365
as soon as I heard
the music start.

39:08.365 --> 39:09.601
And what I love
about your version

39:09.601 --> 39:11.972
is you introduced
some edge to it,

39:11.972 --> 39:15.379
and it was really cool
and made it distinct.

39:15.379 --> 39:17.851
Do you speak Portuguese?
Yes. I was born here,

39:17.851 --> 39:19.387
but my family's
from Brazil,

39:19.387 --> 39:20.957
so my parents are Brazilian.
Wow.

39:20.957 --> 39:23.963
And you're on Team Legend.
Welcome, Sabrina.

39:23.963 --> 39:25.132
Thank you so much.

39:25.132 --> 39:27.369
Sabrina was super cool,

39:27.369 --> 39:29.106
but I have Carolina
who is bilingual.

39:29.106 --> 39:31.010
I didn't want them
to really have to compete,

39:58.933 --> 40:00.402
What's your name
and where are you from?

40:00.402 --> 40:02.372
Xavier Cornell.
I'm 17 years old,

40:02.372 --> 40:05.646
and I'm from Los Angeles,
California.

40:05.646 --> 40:07.884
I was intrigued
by your performance

40:07.884 --> 40:10.122
because there was, like,
a certain fragility

40:10.122 --> 40:11.525
that was very interesting.

40:11.525 --> 40:14.029
I thought that was a really
beautiful take on that song.

40:14.029 --> 40:17.002
It almost sounded like the song
from the "Titanic."

40:17.002 --> 40:18.338
Like the Céline Dion song?

40:18.338 --> 40:20.008
At the end,
you did coincidentally,

40:20.008 --> 40:20.843
like, the same run.

40:20.843 --> 40:22.479
Man, I sure hope
you don't get sued

40:22.479 --> 40:24.450
for stealing that lick
from the "Titanic" song.

40:25.686 --> 40:28.124
Céline Dion is like, "Hello.
That's my run."

40:29.460 --> 40:31.297
My God, I love your impression
of her.

40:31.297 --> 40:33.067
Hi, Xavier.
Hi, Kelly.

40:33.067 --> 40:35.506
I'm so stoked that I don't
have to fight for you.

40:35.506 --> 40:38.411
I think you are gonna
be a dark horse

40:38.411 --> 40:39.915
in this competition
in the sense that

40:39.915 --> 40:42.186
I don't think everybody
knows how gifted you are.

40:42.186 --> 40:43.388
I don't even know
if you know,

40:43.388 --> 40:44.558
especially finding out
you're 17.

40:44.558 --> 40:46.327
I just think that
it's meant to be.

40:46.327 --> 40:47.530
Whoo!

40:47.530 --> 40:50.570
I'm inspired
by Xavier's creativity.

40:50.570 --> 40:52.640
Whoo!
Congratulations.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.511
I love how my team
is shaping up,

40:54.511 --> 40:58.017
but with two spots left,
I'm being extra picky.

Ariana Grande was gonna be

41:24.036 --> 41:25.673
My name is Libianca.

41:25.673 --> 41:29.446
I was born in St. Paul,
Minnesota.

41:31.484 --> 41:35.760
I moved to Cameroon with my mom
and my little brother

41:35.760 --> 41:37.262
when I was 4 years old.

41:37.262 --> 41:40.101
My parents are
full‐blooded Cameroonians.

41:40.101 --> 41:43.141
We took both of them
back to Cameroon

41:43.141 --> 41:47.149
so they can grow up
and see where we grew up

41:47.149 --> 41:50.255
and how life looks like
in Africa.

41:50.255 --> 41:54.731
When I first came to
Cameroon, I was so distraught.

41:54.731 --> 41:57.604
We did not have phones,
no tablets,

41:57.604 --> 42:00.576
and we had a TV
that was this big.

42:00.576 --> 42:03.381
I'm not kidding you.
This big.

42:03.381 --> 42:06.622
I got accustomed
to the lifestyle pretty quick,

42:06.622 --> 42:08.291
to be honest.

42:08.291 --> 42:12.032
When I was in Cameroon, I was
exposed to a whole lot of music.

42:12.032 --> 42:13.334
The music that I used to hear

42:13.334 --> 42:18.411
was Afrobeats,
African genres of music.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.248
That was pretty amazing.

42:20.248 --> 42:23.154
When I was 13 years old,
I moved to America.

42:23.154 --> 42:25.025
It was very hard to make friends

42:25.025 --> 42:28.398
because the ways in which
we communicate back home

42:28.398 --> 42:31.505
is not the same as, you know,
how people communicate here.

42:31.505 --> 42:34.410
If you call somebody fat in
Cameroon, it's a compliment.

42:34.410 --> 42:40.055
Walk up to this girl,
I say, "Wow, you look fat."

42:40.055 --> 42:41.592
That did not go well.

42:44.263 --> 42:46.702
After that,
I just started to sing

42:46.702 --> 42:49.073
I've barely got social skills,

42:49.073 --> 42:52.145
but my voice just seemed
to attract friends.

42:52.145 --> 42:53.181
It made me popular.

42:53.181 --> 42:55.252
♪ Is it too much

42:55.252 --> 42:57.322
One morning,
I came back from work.

42:57.322 --> 43:01.197
I heard the voice.
I was like, "What?"

43:01.197 --> 43:02.767
With the little means
that we had,

43:02.767 --> 43:06.541
we decided to give everything
that she needs for her music.

43:06.541 --> 43:09.748
On that stage,
you'll be carrying

43:09.748 --> 43:13.087
the light of Africa
as a whole.

43:16.327 --> 43:19.668
I feel so proud to be
standing here

43:19.668 --> 43:23.474
and representing
my Cameroonians.

43:23.474 --> 43:25.613
I was that little girl
watching TV

43:25.613 --> 43:30.556
and seeing all these artists,
and I'm like, "I wish I could."

43:30.556 --> 43:31.858
And now I'm here.

43:31.858 --> 43:35.833
Right through those doors
are huge opportunities.

43:35.833 --> 43:38.304
My heart's really warm.

43:38.304 --> 43:41.511
I feel really grateful
for my friends and my family

43:41.511 --> 43:43.882
and very grateful to God.

43:43.882 --> 43:45.886
Let the voice move you.

43:45.886 --> 43:48.491
Without Him, I ‐‐
I wouldn't be able

43:48.491 --> 43:52.567

Hi. What's your name?
Where are you from?

45:44.724 --> 45:46.628
My name is Libianca.

45:46.628 --> 45:47.864
I am 20 years old.

45:47.864 --> 45:52.305
And I'm from Minneapolis,
Minnesota,

45:52.305 --> 45:55.880
but I lived most of my life
in Cameroon, West Africa.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.015
Oh, wow.

45:58.351 --> 45:59.621
Well,
that was beautiful.

45:59.621 --> 46:01.023
I do think that you have
a gorgeous voice,

46:01.023 --> 46:02.492
how you kept doing the runs,

46:02.492 --> 46:04.496
like, kind of down low,
that was so warm.

46:04.496 --> 46:06.033
I don't know what really
kept me from turning.

46:06.033 --> 46:08.438
I think I didn't know
the song, the melody of it.

46:08.438 --> 46:10.910
I think the song kind of
made it tough for us

46:10.910 --> 46:12.647
to hear your voice a lot

46:12.647 --> 46:14.751
because there are
a lot of quick notes in it.

46:14.751 --> 46:15.886
SZA, right?
Yep.

46:15.886 --> 46:17.590
I think
that song particularly

46:17.590 --> 46:18.992
didn't give us a chance
to hear

46:18.992 --> 46:20.696
every aspect of your voice,

46:20.696 --> 46:22.332
but I'm so excited for you

46:22.332 --> 46:25.004
because you have two fantastic
coaches to choose from.

46:25.004 --> 46:27.342
Libianca,
I'm obsessed with you.

46:27.342 --> 46:29.581
I respect you so much
for picking a SZA song

46:29.581 --> 46:32.385
'cause she writes in a way
that's so unique to her.

46:32.385 --> 46:34.624
It's like a huge undertaking
to sing a SZA song.
Yes.

46:34.624 --> 46:37.630
And you did such a beautiful job
of making it your own.

46:37.630 --> 46:38.866
I was so excited.

46:38.866 --> 46:40.536
Your low range,

46:40.536 --> 46:42.573
like, you kind of sat
in that space

46:42.573 --> 46:44.076
for a majority
of the performance,

46:44.076 --> 46:45.513
and I was like,
"She's so good at that.

46:45.513 --> 46:46.782
I wonder if that's,
like, her thing.

46:46.782 --> 46:47.817
Does she have the highs?"

46:47.817 --> 46:49.486
And then you saved it
for the end,

46:49.486 --> 46:50.923
and it felt
more emotional that way.

46:50.923 --> 46:52.627
I'm freaking out.
I really hope you pick me.

46:52.627 --> 46:54.564
You're so good.
You're so beautiful.

46:54.564 --> 46:56.000
I'm obsessed.
You sound divine.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.703
You look amazing.
Thank you.

46:57.703 --> 46:58.872
Um, and yeah, okay.

46:58.872 --> 47:01.076
So anyway,
nice to meet you.

47:01.076 --> 47:02.747
Thank you for your time.

47:02.747 --> 47:04.082
What a pleasure to hear you.

47:04.082 --> 47:05.820
Um, okay.

47:05.820 --> 47:07.088
Blake?

47:07.088 --> 47:11.531
Oh, my God,
that was amazing.

47:11.531 --> 47:15.471
I am obviously
the coach for you.

47:15.471 --> 47:16.875
Why?

47:16.875 --> 47:18.946
She said, "Why?"

47:18.946 --> 47:21.785
"Why?" Ha‐ha!

47:21.785 --> 47:24.490
Let me think
about that.

47:24.490 --> 47:27.630
We hear a lot of singers
come across the stage,

47:27.630 --> 47:29.601
and a lot of coaches
that work on this show

47:29.601 --> 47:32.640
that they're capable
of so much,

47:32.640 --> 47:34.978
and actually Ariana's
a prime example of that.

47:34.978 --> 47:36.548
One of the reasons
I'm a fan of hers

47:36.548 --> 47:38.952
is that there's nothing
she can't sing.

47:38.952 --> 47:39.988
Where's this going?

47:41.123 --> 47:42.760
She picks her moment,

47:42.760 --> 47:44.864
and that's what was impressive
about your performance.

47:44.864 --> 47:47.737
Living down there in that lower
register for as long as you did,

47:47.737 --> 47:49.741
you know, it'd be one thing
to kind of touch on it here

47:49.741 --> 47:51.978
and there, but you were
wallowing in it down there,

47:51.978 --> 47:55.786
and you had so much control
and there was so much volume.

47:55.786 --> 47:58.825
That's what really shocked me
about your voice.

47:58.825 --> 48:00.963
Yeah, I'm the country guy.
But you know what?

48:00.963 --> 48:03.735
I've won this show with all
different kinds of artists,

48:03.735 --> 48:06.140
and the coach
and artist relationship

48:06.140 --> 48:07.877
is about whatever I can do

48:07.877 --> 48:10.749
that can help you be the best
at whatever you want to be.

48:10.749 --> 48:11.918
That's my job.

48:11.918 --> 48:14.156
I'd be honored
to be your coach.

48:14.156 --> 48:15.759
Who do you pick?

48:15.759 --> 48:18.030
Whose team
would you like to be on?

48:23.775 --> 48:27.148
Somebody said something
that gave me a sign

48:27.148 --> 48:28.819
'cause I asked God
to give me a sign.

48:28.819 --> 48:31.858
And somebody said something
that gave me that sign.

48:35.532 --> 48:37.402
Okay.

48:45.686 --> 48:48.825
♪ This is "The Voice"Welcome back.

48:48.825 --> 48:52.533
Somebody said something
that gave me a sign

48:52.533 --> 48:53.969
'cause I asked God
to give me a sign.

48:53.969 --> 48:56.841
And somebody said something
that gave me that sign.

48:59.514 --> 49:02.152
Okay.

49:02.152 --> 49:03.922
So, Blake,
I'm gonna go with you.

49:03.922 --> 49:04.991
Yeah!

49:07.195 --> 49:10.669
Libianca! Yes!

49:10.669 --> 49:11.938
What?

49:11.938 --> 49:15.579
Libianca picked Blake Shelton
over Ariana Grande.

49:15.579 --> 49:17.048
No one saw that coming.

49:17.048 --> 49:18.451
What just happened?

49:18.451 --> 49:21.123
Well, I think Ariana
knows for sure now

49:21.123 --> 49:22.593
who she's dealing with.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.731
What did you say?
None of your business.

49:24.731 --> 49:26.601
I poured my heart out to her.

49:26.601 --> 49:29.006
I don't understand.
I‐I‐I can't talk about it yet.

49:29.006 --> 49:30.509
Oh, yeah.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.980
God was speaking
through our cowboy.

49:32.980 --> 49:35.586
You see that?

49:35.586 --> 49:37.757
What was it that he said
that came from God?

49:37.757 --> 49:42.232
Blake said, "My job as a coach
is to help you be the best

49:42.232 --> 49:43.835
at what it is
that you want to do."
Right.

49:43.835 --> 49:45.806
I have a feeling
Blake is gonna be the one

49:45.806 --> 49:48.612
to really just help me
just do my thing.

49:48.612 --> 49:53.154
God came down with tablets
and said, "Pick Blake."

49:55.993 --> 49:59.767
Whoo‐hoo‐hoo‐hoo!

49:59.767 --> 50:00.836
Whoo!

50:00.836 --> 50:02.640
Just wait.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.677
So much of the show
is just gonna be

50:04.677 --> 50:06.648
me pointing at Blake
in despair.

50:06.648 --> 50:08.618
Doing this.
Like, so much of it
is going to be, like,

50:08.618 --> 50:10.789
cuts of me going like
and then like...

50:10.789 --> 50:12.994
The squinty eyes at me.

50:12.994 --> 50:15.699
Oh, man.

50:17.102 --> 50:18.905
My name's Jared Brasher.
I'm 26 years old,

50:18.905 --> 50:20.174
and I'm from Huntsville,
Alabama.

50:20.174 --> 50:22.646
Baseball was always
my true love.

50:22.646 --> 50:24.650
It's what I've done ever since
I was 4 years old.

50:24.650 --> 50:26.186
And the dream of playing
in the Major Leagues

50:26.186 --> 50:27.823
was always my goal.

50:27.823 --> 50:31.063
In 2017, I was drafted by
the Washington Nationals

50:31.063 --> 50:32.767
in the Minor Leagues.

50:32.767 --> 50:35.539
But in 2019,
I was released.

50:35.539 --> 50:36.808
I kind of had a reality check

50:36.808 --> 50:38.144
trying to figure out
what I was gonna do.

50:38.144 --> 50:39.681
After baseball was over,

50:39.681 --> 50:41.183
it was time for me
to focus on our family.

50:41.183 --> 50:42.853
We had a little boy in December.

50:42.853 --> 50:45.626
Ended up doing medical sales.
That's what I do now.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.963
It's provided for my family.
It's put food on the table.

50:47.963 --> 50:50.669
But at the end of the day,
it's not my dream.

50:50.669 --> 50:53.040
I always sang the entire time
that I was playing baseball,

50:53.040 --> 50:56.548
but it was a passion of mine
that I never really considered

50:56.548 --> 50:59.687
to be a possibility
of becoming a career.

50:59.687 --> 51:02.092
I have never performed
in front of a live audience.

51:02.092 --> 51:03.595
I've never been in a situation

51:03.595 --> 51:05.331
where I felt the courage
to be able to do it,

51:05.331 --> 51:07.001
and then this opportunity
came along.

51:07.001 --> 51:08.572
Jared being out there

51:08.572 --> 51:10.709
and auditioning
for "The Voice" is huge.

51:10.709 --> 51:13.548
Most people don't get an
opportunity to chase one dream,

51:13.548 --> 51:15.652
and now
he's on to his second.

51:15.652 --> 51:17.990
This could be
life‐changing for us.

51:17.990 --> 51:20.562
Say, "Good luck, Daddy.
Bye. We love you."

51:20.562 --> 51:22.332
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy.
I love you.

51:22.332 --> 51:24.804
Yeah. Bye.

51:24.804 --> 51:26.708
This blind audition
will be my first gig,

51:26.708 --> 51:28.845
and it's a little scary
to think about.

51:28.845 --> 51:31.684
I think baseball played
a huge role in this process.

51:31.684 --> 51:33.688
Being able to be on the mound
with the ball in your hand

51:33.688 --> 51:35.224
and know that
every single second,

51:35.224 --> 51:37.095
somebody is watching you.

51:37.095 --> 51:38.264
I'm here to
prove this to myself,

51:38.264 --> 51:39.600
that I can do something new.

51:39.600 --> 51:40.803
Be a country musician.

51:40.803 --> 51:42.673
And I'm here for my wife
and for my son.

51:42.673 --> 51:44.811
And I'm ready.
It's game day.

Proud of you, Jared.
Nice try, buddy.

52:53.815 --> 52:55.786
What's your name?
My name's Jared Brasher.

52:55.786 --> 53:00.094
I'm 26 years old, and
I'm from Huntsville, Alabama.

53:00.094 --> 53:01.731
I know this isn't
what you ‐‐

53:01.731 --> 53:03.300
it's not what any of us
wanted, man.

53:03.300 --> 53:05.338
I just feel like
the performance overall

53:05.338 --> 53:07.743
never felt like
you got comfortable,

53:07.743 --> 53:09.446
and it's frustrating for me

53:09.446 --> 53:12.720
because you have
a great country voice,

53:12.720 --> 53:15.926
but it doesn't matter
if you're not able to control it

53:15.926 --> 53:17.830
in this situation, you know,
and I know the nerves.

53:17.830 --> 53:19.734
I don't even know
what that must be like.

53:19.734 --> 53:21.336
This is my first time ever
actually performing

53:21.336 --> 53:22.706
in front of anybody.
Oh, wow.

53:22.706 --> 53:23.842
What?
What?

53:23.842 --> 53:25.011
Yeah, so ‐‐
This was your ‐‐

53:25.011 --> 53:26.346
Wow.
What the heck.

53:28.350 --> 53:30.087
That's awesome.
Thank you.

53:30.087 --> 53:31.891
My thing is baseball,
it's always been baseball,

53:31.891 --> 53:33.728
so I was a professional
baseball player.

53:33.728 --> 53:36.033
Wow.
You're bold enough
to be like,

53:36.033 --> 53:37.970
"Sure, I'll try that
for my first time

53:37.970 --> 53:39.339
ever being in front ‐‐"
you know what I'm saying?

53:39.339 --> 53:40.943
That's something ‐‐
you can't teach that,

53:40.943 --> 53:42.846
to be that confident,
that comfortable in your skin.

53:42.846 --> 53:44.482
That's amazing.
Thank you.

53:44.482 --> 53:46.754
Well, you do have
a really special tone.

53:46.754 --> 53:51.731
I think there was a bit
of control that I was missing

53:51.731 --> 53:53.735
and maybe that would come
from more experience.

53:53.735 --> 53:55.004
Obviously, this is your
first time singing

53:55.004 --> 53:57.375
on a stage like this,
and that's insane.

53:57.375 --> 54:00.181
The fact that this is that,
you knocked it out of the park.

54:00.181 --> 54:02.085
But I do think that
with time ‐‐

54:02.085 --> 54:03.220
No pun intended.

54:03.220 --> 54:04.489
Oh, yeah.
There you go.

54:04.489 --> 54:05.926
Knocked it out the park.
There you go, yeah.

54:05.926 --> 54:07.295
There's been lots
of baseball puns.

54:07.295 --> 54:09.499
That's amazing.
It feels like

54:09.499 --> 54:11.370
it's just a little rough
around the edges

54:11.370 --> 54:13.808
and needs some finesse
and some touch.

54:13.808 --> 54:15.011
And if you spend
some more time,

54:15.011 --> 54:17.015
just like you committed
to your sport,

54:17.015 --> 54:18.518
that's what you have to do
with your voice, too.

54:18.518 --> 54:20.021
Thank you so much
for coming today, man.

54:20.021 --> 54:21.758
Thank you, guys.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Jared.

54:21.758 --> 54:23.895
I really loved Jared's story.

54:23.895 --> 54:26.400
And the fact that he was able
to even make it to this point

54:26.400 --> 54:28.037
tells you that
he's got some talent.

54:28.037 --> 54:32.378
He just hasn't had a chance
to develop it yet.

54:32.378 --> 54:33.815
My team's almost full,

54:33.815 --> 54:35.752
so I'm just being
extra picky right now.

54:35.752 --> 54:37.388
Sure.
I'll just go sing in front

54:37.388 --> 54:38.892
of millions of people
for my first time.

54:38.892 --> 54:39.927
He needs to go
spend a little time

54:39.927 --> 54:41.396
in the batting cages,
if you will.

54:41.396 --> 54:42.967
Yeah. I was ‐‐

54:42.967 --> 54:45.438
And then swing for the fence
when it's time, you know?

54:45.438 --> 54:48.745
Dad jokes.

54:57.997 --> 55:00.001
♪ This is "The Voice"Welcome back to
the blind auditions.

55:03.875 --> 55:05.011
Oh, my God.

55:05.011 --> 55:08.484
I've been watching "The Voice"
since I was very little.

55:08.484 --> 55:11.824
I'm a huge fan,
my entire family is,

55:11.824 --> 55:14.930
so it's super‐surreal
to be here right now,

55:14.930 --> 55:17.068
especially seeing that
behind me.

55:17.068 --> 55:18.370
Yay!

55:18.370 --> 55:20.374
I'm Sophia Bromberg.
I'm 16 years old.

55:20.374 --> 55:22.546
And I'm from
San Rafael, California.

55:22.546 --> 55:25.151
That's about 15 minutes away
from San Francisco.

55:25.151 --> 55:29.827
So, I grew up in the Bay Area
in a very musical family.

55:29.827 --> 55:32.966
My mom sings,
my dad tries to sing.

55:32.966 --> 55:36.473
My dad's really into
hip‐hop and R&B.

55:36.473 --> 55:38.344
My mom introduced me to, like,

55:38.344 --> 55:40.816
classical music
and classical piano.

55:40.816 --> 55:42.485
I'm a senior,
and my high school

55:42.485 --> 55:44.255
has such an amazing
music program.

55:44.255 --> 55:45.491
I've learned so much.

55:45.491 --> 55:46.961
That just opened up

55:46.961 --> 55:48.565
all these opportunities
for her to perform

55:48.565 --> 55:52.171
and be in the limelight,
showcasing her voice.

55:52.171 --> 55:55.478
With the Internet,
social media,

55:55.478 --> 55:57.983
there are a lot
of different struggles

55:57.983 --> 56:00.856
that I feel like teenagers today
have to deal with.

56:00.856 --> 56:05.197
I know how destructive
comparing yourself to others

56:05.197 --> 56:07.268
can be for teenagers.

56:07.268 --> 56:12.980
Me specifically, I struggled
a lot with believing in myself.

56:12.980 --> 56:19.092
That channeled into anxiety,
anorexia, and bulimia.

56:19.092 --> 56:20.996
She had
an eating disorder for a while

56:20.996 --> 56:23.000
that I didn't really
even understand

56:23.000 --> 56:26.440
it was an eating disorder
until she was 12 years old.

56:26.440 --> 56:29.312
We saw the weight dropping
to a point

56:29.312 --> 56:31.316
where, "This is a problem."

56:31.316 --> 56:33.420
We assessed the situation,
and together,

56:33.420 --> 56:35.491
we started
the healing process.

56:35.491 --> 56:38.464
I had a problem,
and I needed to fix it.

56:38.464 --> 56:42.573
There was definitely a period
of denial or anger,

56:42.573 --> 56:45.244
and I'm very grateful
that my parents were there

56:45.244 --> 56:48.016
to support me.

56:48.016 --> 56:51.958
I had a lot of free time
during my recovery process,

56:51.958 --> 56:54.563
so I did a lot of music.

56:54.563 --> 56:57.502
It was definitely
a very cathartic experience,

56:57.502 --> 57:00.642
and music really
helped me through it.

57:00.642 --> 57:03.347
I'm at a stage
of my recovery now

57:03.347 --> 57:05.519
where I feel very comfortable
talking about it,

57:05.519 --> 57:08.357
because showing that
to the entire world,

57:08.357 --> 57:11.998
hopefully that is inspiring
for anybody else struggling

57:11.998 --> 57:15.705
to maybe find the courage
to just open up

57:15.705 --> 57:18.912
to, like, a friend
or their parents,

57:18.912 --> 57:21.517
because your loved ones
do want to help.

57:21.517 --> 57:24.456
For her
to be here today,

57:24.456 --> 57:28.598
showing the world what
she really is on the inside,

57:28.598 --> 57:32.071
is the most important part
of her experience here

57:32.071 --> 57:34.643
and being a voice
for who you are

57:34.643 --> 57:36.581
and what you've made
of yourself.

57:36.581 --> 57:38.685
I'm so proud of you.

57:38.685 --> 57:40.622
Oh!

57:40.622 --> 57:43.127
I definitely
have grown a lot.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.231
Go, Soph!

57:45.231 --> 57:46.500
So excited!

57:46.500 --> 57:49.105
I'm excited for
the possibilities.

57:49.105 --> 57:51.176
Getting a chair turn
would be so awesome

57:51.176 --> 57:53.715
because I love the idea
of being able

57:53.715 --> 57:57.956
to learn personally
from the coaches,

57:57.956 --> 58:01.163
so I'm just going to go
out there and give it my all.

Hi. My name
is Sophia Bromberg.

59:53.688 --> 59:56.627
I'm 16 years old,
just got my driver's license.

Oh, wow.

1:00:01.202 --> 1:00:04.510
Congratulations. That was so
beautiful and so interesting.

1:00:04.510 --> 1:00:08.483
There are so many people
in your throat box.

1:00:08.483 --> 1:00:10.220
One of them, I noticed,
is Ariana.

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:13.226
They're all so beautiful
and interesting

1:00:13.226 --> 1:00:15.632
and well‐controlled
and well‐oiled.

1:00:15.632 --> 1:00:18.136
Oh, my God.
I would love
the opportunity

1:00:18.136 --> 1:00:21.877
to help you continue to find
and solidify your own sound,

1:00:21.877 --> 1:00:23.648
because I really do think
you have

1:00:23.648 --> 1:00:27.121
such an identifiable
and unique voice.

1:00:27.121 --> 1:00:31.296
What a beautiful, colorful,
entertaining performance.

1:00:31.296 --> 1:00:33.500
And you have whistle notes,
as well.

1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:36.540
What do you know about
whistle notes, Ariana?

1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:37.876
A thing or two.

1:00:37.876 --> 1:00:40.381
That was such
a riveting performance.

1:00:40.381 --> 1:00:43.120
You have all these things
you can do, and as a coach,

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.291
it's figuring out how to use it
in the best way

1:00:45.291 --> 1:00:47.529
to connect and tell the story
of the song.

1:00:47.529 --> 1:00:49.265
What kind of music
do you like?

1:00:49.265 --> 1:00:52.739
I like to listen to pop
and R&B and soul...
Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

1:00:52.739 --> 1:00:54.543
...and basically
everything.

1:00:54.543 --> 1:00:55.845
That Ariana releases.

1:00:55.845 --> 1:00:57.816
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

1:00:57.816 --> 1:01:00.722
You can hear all of that
in your voice, honestly.

1:01:00.722 --> 1:01:03.528
Um, I heard the pop‐folky vibe
for a second,

1:01:03.528 --> 1:01:07.703
the soul, the runs, and,
obviously, the Ariana of it all.

1:01:09.238 --> 1:01:11.142
You paint with
your vocal chords,

1:01:11.142 --> 1:01:13.480
and I think
it's incredibly cool.

1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:16.821
Like, that's why I was the first
one to press my button.

1:01:16.821 --> 1:01:18.825
And the imagery that,
like, comes in my mind

1:01:18.825 --> 1:01:21.564
when you're singing
is, like, a beautiful story.

1:01:21.564 --> 1:01:23.200
And I think that
that's really special.

1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:26.206
I'm so glad you compared
her voice to paint

1:01:26.206 --> 1:01:28.811
because my team,
I've been saying it in my head

1:01:28.811 --> 1:01:30.882
this whole time,
is what I call a canvas.

1:01:30.882 --> 1:01:32.919
Okay, okay.
So you can paint
your way over here.

1:01:32.919 --> 1:01:36.627
Except she kept it in her head,
but I said it, so...

1:01:36.627 --> 1:01:39.432
That folk sound
that you have

1:01:39.432 --> 1:01:41.469
is the exact reason
I didn't hit my button,

1:01:41.469 --> 1:01:44.475
only to protect somebody
that's already on ‐‐ on my team.

1:01:44.475 --> 1:01:45.812
But none of that
matters.

1:01:45.812 --> 1:01:49.853
What does matter is who you're
going to pick as your coach.

1:01:49.853 --> 1:01:51.456
Okay.

1:01:51.456 --> 1:01:54.863
Sophia,
shock the world!

1:01:56.934 --> 1:02:01.209
First, I would just like to
say that I love all of you,

1:02:01.209 --> 1:02:03.981
and I'd be lucky to work
with any of you guys.

1:02:03.981 --> 1:02:06.219
Kelly! Kelly!

1:02:06.219 --> 1:02:08.858
The coach
that I pick...

1:02:10.461 --> 1:02:11.831

other pop and R&B vocalists,

for about
five to seven years.
Oh, yeah.

1:06:44.910 --> 1:06:46.814

It was not ‐‐ not my scene.

1:06:56.967 --> 1:06:59.706
My mother adores Frank Sinatra

1:06:59.706 --> 1:07:02.111
and was the one who actually
introduced me to him.

1:07:02.111 --> 1:07:05.050
And the more I listened to jazz,
the more I fell in love with it.

1:07:05.050 --> 1:07:08.056
And I realized that's truly
what I ‐‐ what I loved.

1:07:08.056 --> 1:07:12.832

you have to bring the class.

sound kind of weird ‐‐

1:07:19.713 --> 1:07:22.619
but it's definitely
something I enjoy.

1:07:22.619 --> 1:07:26.960
I do have some groupies,
but they're women over 65.

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:29.298
Frank Sinatra is a hero of mine.

1:07:29.298 --> 1:07:32.639
It's funny, when he first
started out, in the '40s,

1:07:32.639 --> 1:07:34.275
he had the nickname "The Voice."

1:07:34.275 --> 1:07:36.613
He was the original holder
of that title.

1:07:36.613 --> 1:07:39.185
So I would definitely love
to bring that title back

1:07:39.185 --> 1:07:41.690
to the genre
where it started.

1:07:41.690 --> 1:07:43.326
Congratulations.

1:07:43.326 --> 1:07:46.567
I'm really going to enjoy
what's about to go down here...

1:07:46.567 --> 1:07:49.138
It's about to go down.
...uh, between
Ariana and Kelly.

1:07:49.138 --> 1:07:51.844
Uh, I'm a huge fan of ‐‐ of
that song and that style.

1:07:51.844 --> 1:07:53.647
I'm actually shocked
you didn't turn around.

1:07:53.647 --> 1:07:55.050
You love this style.
I do, too.

1:07:55.050 --> 1:07:57.054
I just feel like
there was a personality

1:07:57.054 --> 1:07:59.225
that I was looking for from you
on that performance

1:07:59.225 --> 1:08:01.764
I didn't feel like was there,
but I think it can be there.

1:08:01.764 --> 1:08:04.201
One of these girls is going
to bring it out of you, damn it.

1:08:04.201 --> 1:08:06.707
I'll talk, and then I'll let
the ladies battle it out

1:08:06.707 --> 1:08:09.078
for your affection.
I love that we're about to,

1:08:09.078 --> 1:08:11.182
like, Mad Max,
just full‐on go to war.

1:08:11.182 --> 1:08:12.986
We're going to be
fighting to the ground.

1:08:12.986 --> 1:08:15.925
I also love
this style of music, too,

1:08:15.925 --> 1:08:17.595
and I sing it sometimes, too,

1:08:17.595 --> 1:08:21.369
and I just felt it was
a little too spoken sounding.

1:08:21.369 --> 1:08:25.077
And so, it wasn't clear to me
what your singing voice

1:08:25.077 --> 1:08:27.916
was going to sound like
based on that performance.

1:08:27.916 --> 1:08:29.786
But I don't believe
that's any reason

1:08:29.786 --> 1:08:32.224
why you won't be amazing
in future rounds.

1:08:32.224 --> 1:08:34.095
That made me smile
the whole time.

1:08:34.095 --> 1:08:35.765
I loved your choices.

1:08:35.765 --> 1:08:38.236
You have, like, a time capsule
in your throat.

1:08:38.236 --> 1:08:40.373
Like, you sound like you're
transporting me to another time.

1:08:40.373 --> 1:08:42.779
I feel like I'm wearing,
like, a sock‐hop dress.

1:08:42.779 --> 1:08:45.083
I think they called the fans of
Frank Sinatra back in the day,

1:08:45.083 --> 1:08:47.154
they called them
bobby soxers.
Oh, yeah.

1:08:47.154 --> 1:08:48.991
Yeah.
It was, like,
the perfect balance

1:08:48.991 --> 1:08:51.797
between paying homage
to that era

1:08:51.797 --> 1:08:53.266
but also
making it your own.

1:08:53.266 --> 1:08:57.007
I thought it was so joyous
and your tone was so warm,

1:08:57.007 --> 1:08:58.911
and I want to
hear it blasting

1:08:58.911 --> 1:09:00.982
in my kitchen
throughout the holidays.

1:09:00.982 --> 1:09:04.021
I also know that
you're capable of so much more

1:09:04.021 --> 1:09:05.792
and you can try
other things, too.

1:09:05.792 --> 1:09:08.396
We can navigate that
together.

1:09:08.396 --> 1:09:11.002
And I would love
to be the person to help you

1:09:11.002 --> 1:09:14.275
execute your vision for this
and go all the way.

1:09:14.275 --> 1:09:16.112
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1:09:16.112 --> 1:09:17.849
I love your voice.

1:09:17.849 --> 1:09:20.387
It's like a timeless,
classic sound, right?
Timeless.

1:09:20.387 --> 1:09:22.992
Right.
And usually
I do tell people,

1:09:22.992 --> 1:09:24.930
"Man, it'd be cool to see
what your take would be

1:09:24.930 --> 1:09:26.834
on a different kind of genre,"
but I think,

1:09:26.834 --> 1:09:30.875
specifically because of
the genre you're doing
and your sound,

1:09:30.875 --> 1:09:32.979
it's actually kind of rad
that, like,

1:09:32.979 --> 1:09:35.083
no one's going to
sound like you.

1:09:35.083 --> 1:09:37.154
No one has this vibe
on this show.

1:09:37.154 --> 1:09:39.258
It's interesting,
strategically speaking,

1:09:39.258 --> 1:09:41.295
just because no one's
going to fill this lane.

1:09:41.295 --> 1:09:44.268
I also think we would sound
amazing in the finale.

1:09:44.268 --> 1:09:46.172
Like, since we sing a duet
together,

1:09:46.172 --> 1:09:48.009
we could do something
with Frank and Nancy Sinatra.

1:09:48.009 --> 1:09:50.046
And to show that,
you know, in the lives

1:09:50.046 --> 1:09:51.449
and have the big band
behind you

1:09:51.449 --> 1:09:53.754
and have that whole vibe
happening

1:09:53.754 --> 1:09:55.691
would be really cool
and special.

1:09:55.691 --> 1:09:58.797
Congratulations just for making
the show more interesting.

1:09:58.797 --> 1:10:01.002
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.

1:10:01.002 --> 1:10:03.273
Well, you've got a decision
to make, Wyatt.

1:10:03.273 --> 1:10:05.778
Who do you pick
as your coach?

1:10:13.092 --> 1:10:16.465
My girlfriend is a huge fan
of Ariana,

1:10:16.465 --> 1:10:20.307
but I got to go with my gut,
and I‐I pick Kelly.

1:10:20.307 --> 1:10:23.313
Wow! Yes!

1:10:23.313 --> 1:10:26.920
Oh, my God!

1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:30.126
I love your sound!

1:10:30.126 --> 1:10:32.297
Wyatt is
a really unique singer.

1:10:32.297 --> 1:10:35.738
I am so excited about
working with big band, like,

1:10:35.738 --> 1:10:37.775
whether it's Rosemary Clooney,
Ella Fitzgerald,

1:10:37.775 --> 1:10:39.846
Frank, Dean Martin.
I love all those songs.

1:10:39.846 --> 1:10:42.819
Welcome to Team Kelly!
I'm such a fan. I'm so excited.

1:10:42.819 --> 1:10:44.723
The other coaches need to
be worried about my team

1:10:44.723 --> 1:10:46.225
because we're coming in hot,
and we're coming with

1:10:46.225 --> 1:10:49.031
every possible genre
you can think of.

1:10:49.031 --> 1:10:50.935
Come on, ARiana,
fight for somebody.

1:10:50.935 --> 1:10:52.839
No more of
this pillow‐fighting stuff.

"You should do something

1:11:43.239 --> 1:11:44.843
that makes you happy,"

1:11:44.843 --> 1:11:46.513
and performing
makes me feel happy.

1:11:46.513 --> 1:11:48.851
It's what I love to do.

My name is Alexandra Stojack.

1:11:50.387 --> 1:11:53.192
I'm 20 years old.
And I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio.

1:11:53.192 --> 1:11:59.238
Alexandra was a child who
lived to dance and sing.

1:11:59.238 --> 1:12:01.409
I knew Alexandra
was destined to be performing

1:12:01.409 --> 1:12:04.315
in the way she is now
when she was in a T‐shirt
and a little diaper

1:12:04.315 --> 1:12:06.419
performing on the back stoop
of our house.

1:12:06.419 --> 1:12:09.325
Yes.
And she hasn't stopped
since then.

1:12:10.561 --> 1:12:13.099
I was in my junior year
of high school.

1:12:13.099 --> 1:12:14.836
We were doing "Hairspray."

1:12:14.836 --> 1:12:16.305
All throughout those rehearsals,

1:12:16.305 --> 1:12:18.309
I experienced headaches.

1:12:18.309 --> 1:12:20.046
I was in a lot of pain,

1:12:20.046 --> 1:12:23.419
and I didn't want it
to affect me being in the show.

1:12:23.419 --> 1:12:26.158
It took a toll on me.

1:12:26.158 --> 1:12:29.365
I tried so hard
to push through.

1:12:29.365 --> 1:12:32.070
She would have
a lot of pain.

1:12:32.070 --> 1:12:34.141
We finally were put into
the headache clinic

1:12:34.141 --> 1:12:36.012
at Cincinnati
Children's Hospital,

1:12:36.012 --> 1:12:39.853
where they did an MRI
and found that she had
Chiari malformation.

1:12:39.853 --> 1:12:41.857
That was a little scary.

1:12:41.857 --> 1:12:44.629
Basically, my brain
was too big for my skull,

1:12:44.629 --> 1:12:48.336
and it was squishing out
the back, near my spine.

1:12:48.336 --> 1:12:51.442
I couldn't participate
in all my dance and my singing,

1:12:51.442 --> 1:12:55.584
and it was really hard, because
the one thing that I loved

1:12:55.584 --> 1:12:58.924
I felt like
I couldn't enjoy anymore.

1:12:58.924 --> 1:13:02.632
Over the next six months,
along with the headaches,

1:13:02.632 --> 1:13:06.138
I started having slurred speech,
stuttering.

1:13:06.138 --> 1:13:09.244
My arms and legs would go tingly
and numb,

1:13:09.244 --> 1:13:11.516
leading to me
getting brain surgery.

1:13:11.516 --> 1:13:13.453
It was a six‐hour surgery.

1:13:13.453 --> 1:13:17.194
They took a piece of my skull
out to allow more room
for my brain.

1:13:17.194 --> 1:13:19.131
Now that the pressure
wasn't there,

1:13:19.131 --> 1:13:21.402
I felt there was, like,
literally a rock

1:13:21.402 --> 1:13:25.377
had been, like,
taken out of my head.

1:13:25.377 --> 1:13:28.015
I could finally sing again
without being in pain,

1:13:28.015 --> 1:13:29.351
and I started songwriting.

1:13:29.351 --> 1:13:32.157
I started experimenting more
with pop music.

1:13:32.157 --> 1:13:35.898
And I found a new voice
that I didn't know I had before.

1:13:35.898 --> 1:13:39.304

added so much
emotional value.

1:21:22.598 --> 1:21:25.102
And I think that that's really
important in a performer.

1:21:25.102 --> 1:21:26.606
And I would love
to be your coach.

1:21:26.606 --> 1:21:27.942
I would love to hold your hand
through this.

1:21:32.985 --> 1:21:35.691
I love you.

1:21:35.691 --> 1:21:39.765
Sometimes we hear that voice
that just grabs us

1:21:39.765 --> 1:21:42.771
and the energy
just explodes from the stage.

1:21:42.771 --> 1:21:44.508
Did you grow up
singing in the church?

1:21:44.508 --> 1:21:45.911
I grew up
singing in the church.

1:21:45.911 --> 1:21:47.615
This is my first time
singing outside of the church.

1:21:47.615 --> 1:21:49.150
Oh, my goodness.
Wow.

1:21:49.150 --> 1:21:51.789
I know that feeling.

1:21:53.593 --> 1:21:56.633
You've never sung secular music
before any audience before?

1:21:56.633 --> 1:21:58.770
Never.
I think
you can go so far,

1:21:58.770 --> 1:22:00.974
and I would love for you
to do it on Team Legend.

1:22:00.974 --> 1:22:02.410
Thank you.

1:22:02.410 --> 1:22:03.647
You're such
a great storyteller.

1:22:03.647 --> 1:22:04.815
Oh, I was
going to say that!

1:22:04.815 --> 1:22:06.753
And I think ‐‐
Yeah, but I did.

1:22:06.753 --> 1:22:07.922
Um, and ‐‐

1:22:09.525 --> 1:22:11.629
I'm just kidding!

1:22:11.629 --> 1:22:12.965
I think what shocked me,
though,

1:22:12.965 --> 1:22:14.835
is I was already in,
and I was like, "Okay,

1:22:14.835 --> 1:22:16.471
I'm going to press my button,
but I'm just enjoying this."

1:22:16.471 --> 1:22:18.677
And then you, on the chorus,
like...

1:22:18.677 --> 1:22:20.614
♪ Call out my name

1:22:20.614 --> 1:22:22.016
I was like,
"Oh, my gosh."

1:22:22.016 --> 1:22:23.920
I would love to be your partner
in this competition.

1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:25.924
I know how to navigate.
I said "navigate."
Oh. Oh, oh.

1:22:25.924 --> 1:22:28.028
Um, I know how to navigate
a competition.
Drink.

1:22:28.028 --> 1:22:30.032
And ‐‐ And I‐I ‐‐ You know,
I've won the show before,

1:22:30.032 --> 1:22:32.838
and I think that if your voice
isn't in the finale,

1:22:32.838 --> 1:22:34.441
something's wrong.

1:22:34.441 --> 1:22:36.445
Thank you. Thank you.

1:22:36.445 --> 1:22:38.850
I'm worried about you

1:22:38.850 --> 1:22:41.188
because you could
really screw up.

1:22:41.188 --> 1:22:42.558
Mm.

1:22:42.558 --> 1:22:44.160
And ‐‐
What?!

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:47.868
You need something more stable
than what's going on down ‐‐

1:22:47.868 --> 1:22:50.974
I mean, Kelly ‐‐
Kelly's going to ‐‐
And doesn't "Blake Shelton"
scream stable?

1:22:50.974 --> 1:22:53.847
No one is the poster child
of stability

1:22:53.847 --> 1:22:56.586
more so
than Blake Shelton.

1:22:56.586 --> 1:22:58.857
Kelly grew up in Texas,

1:22:58.857 --> 1:23:01.461
and she abandoned her home state
and her family.

1:23:01.461 --> 1:23:03.465
Oh, my gosh!
You are...

1:23:03.465 --> 1:23:06.138
John grew up singing
in the church.

1:23:06.138 --> 1:23:08.510
He's probably not been
in a church now...
Oh, my God.

1:23:08.510 --> 1:23:10.614
...in the last 30 ‐‐
30‐plus years.
Oh, my God!

1:23:10.614 --> 1:23:13.085
What?!
Don't listen to him.

1:23:13.085 --> 1:23:15.657
Walked away from it.
Ugh!

1:23:15.657 --> 1:23:17.961
Ariana ‐‐ She could be
the greatest coach

1:23:17.961 --> 1:23:19.598
we've ever seen
on "The Voice,"

1:23:19.598 --> 1:23:23.873
but she could be
the worst coach

1:23:23.873 --> 1:23:26.646
that we've ever seen
here on "The Voice."
Impossible.

1:23:26.646 --> 1:23:28.817
In fact,
I'm leaning...

1:23:29.719 --> 1:23:32.090
You really pick and choose
your moments

1:23:32.090 --> 1:23:34.695
when you want
to be nice to me.
N‐N‐Nobody knows yet.
Nobody knows yet.

1:23:34.695 --> 1:23:39.004
I, on the other hand,
I've been here forever.

1:23:39.004 --> 1:23:43.913
And I'm not sure how much these
others know about it, okay?

1:23:43.913 --> 1:23:46.118
So I'd be honored
to be your coach.

1:23:46.118 --> 1:23:48.890
Who do you pick
as your coach, Brittany Bree?

1:23:52.030 --> 1:23:54.134
Come on!

1:24:01.916 --> 1:24:03.118
John.

1:24:03.118 --> 1:24:06.859
Yes!

1:24:06.859 --> 1:24:08.730
Whoo!

1:24:08.730 --> 1:24:11.803
Miss Brittany Bree has
given herself this moment

1:24:11.803 --> 1:24:15.811
to say to the world, "Hey,
I can really, really sing."

1:24:15.811 --> 1:24:17.548
I brought you a gift.

1:24:17.548 --> 1:24:18.717
I'm feeling myself today.

1:24:18.717 --> 1:24:20.821
I feel like
I'm on a hot streak now.

1:24:20.821 --> 1:24:24.160
I'm feeling good.
Oh, thank you so much!

1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:25.664
I'm so excited.

1:24:25.664 --> 1:24:28.135

She's phenomenal.
I needed that.

Wow.
Thank you.

That was really good.
