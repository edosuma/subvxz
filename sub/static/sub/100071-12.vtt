01:40.292 --> 01:44.962
Hmm. We'd best head back
to wait it out.

Let me guess, you didn't find
any treasure today.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.802

Did you talk to the doctor

01:50.803 --> 01:52.987
about going up on your dose?

01:55.641 --> 01:58.142

I see you've come
to admire our plunder.

03:12.101 --> 03:15.720
Er, technically that plunder
belongs to the town.

03:15.721 --> 03:19.032
It was discovered
in Springfield city limits.

03:19.033 --> 03:22.202
No, we found the gold
in unincorporated waters!

03:22.203 --> 03:25.062
The survey says it's ours!

03:25.063 --> 03:27.374
Sorry, but the town
redrew the boundaries...

03:27.375 --> 03:29.025
yesterday.

03:29.026 --> 03:32.236
But we worked in secret
for 40 years.

03:32.237 --> 03:35.907
I pretended to be
a flimsy, one-note character.

03:35.908 --> 03:38.242
How did you know?

03:38.243 --> 03:42.079
<i>I</i> should have been
your treasure.

03:42.080 --> 03:46.209
Yarr...

03:46.210 --> 03:49.712
(snoring, grumbling)

03:49.713 --> 03:51.973
All right, people.
This town's got doubloons.

03:51.974 --> 03:53.733
Who's got ideas?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.478
If I don't hear anything good,
we're building another stadium,

03:56.479 --> 03:58.813
and no team will come here.

03:58.814 --> 04:00.765
How about a new town clock
where, every hour,

04:00.766 --> 04:02.484
Jesus forgives the Devil?

04:02.485 --> 04:05.770
A new zoo
with more attractive animals.

04:05.771 --> 04:07.989
What about those death panels
we were promised?

04:07.990 --> 04:10.750
Shouting out something before
I know what I'm gonna say.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.445
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame
with no Pearl Jam!

04:14.446 --> 04:16.755
Uh, excuse me. I have an idea.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.242
Now, Marge,
if you'll check your program,

04:19.243 --> 04:22.119
nagging objections
are at the end.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.096
(groans)

04:25.007 --> 04:26.958
Look at the world.

04:26.959 --> 04:30.461
Our children's future
is challenging and uncertain.

04:30.462 --> 04:33.464
This windfall
is our last, best hope

04:33.465 --> 04:35.108
to give our kids
the tools they'll need

04:35.109 --> 04:36.851
to face that future.

04:36.852 --> 04:39.779
To succeed,
our kids must have an education

04:39.780 --> 04:42.932
based on science, technology,

04:42.933 --> 04:45.977
engineering and math.

04:45.978 --> 04:47.436
STEM.

04:47.437 --> 04:50.147
All who find
Marge's idea tiresome,

04:50.148 --> 04:53.651
let out an exaggerated,
sarcastic yawn.

04:53.652 --> 04:56.871
(yawning exaggeratedly)

04:56.872 --> 04:59.132
Okay, okay. I brought someone

04:59.133 --> 05:01.876
you <i> will</i> listen to

Who could say no
to a silky slow jam

05:42.751 --> 05:45.202
about the importance
of technology-based learning?

05:45.203 --> 05:48.831
I'll never have kids because
my nards were cooked by science.

05:48.832 --> 05:50.875
But if I could,
I'd want 'em to learn

05:50.876 --> 05:53.711
about the science
of why they don't exist.

05:53.712 --> 05:56.547
I'd just like to thank
John Legend...'s wife

05:56.548 --> 05:58.883
Chrissy Teigen
for bringing him here today.

05:58.884 --> 06:01.385
Turns out,
there's nothing she loves more

06:01.386 --> 06:04.680
than doing personal favors
for her Instagram followers.

06:04.681 --> 06:07.534
Well, Marge, you did call
the picture I posted

06:07.535 --> 06:10.353
of my kids with ketchup
on their faces "adorbs."

06:10.354 --> 06:13.522
It was. It was totes adorbs.

06:13.523 --> 06:15.900
Baby, we got to get going.
We're gonna be late

06:15.901 --> 06:18.545
for the launch party
for our couples' perfume.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.572
I'm talking
to my online friend IRL.

06:21.573 --> 06:23.507
Go charge the kids' iPads.

06:29.247 --> 06:30.798
Come on, Springfield!

06:30.799 --> 06:33.560
Build your children

06:33.561 --> 06:35.586

06:35.587 --> 06:37.588
- (camera clicks)
- I did it.

06:37.589 --> 06:40.758
I gave our kids hope
for the future.

06:40.759 --> 06:42.718
You have any songs
about how I should be allowed

06:42.719 --> 06:44.571

What are you gonna do with
your forced retirement, sir?

07:00.070 --> 07:02.422
I'm intrigued
by a local skydiving club

07:02.423 --> 07:04.999
who needs someone to sit
in the office and answer phones.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.575
Yeah, well, who cares?

07:06.576 --> 07:09.504
I'll be taking
an Ohio River cruise.

07:09.505 --> 07:11.789
Lot of widows on the Good River.

07:11.790 --> 07:14.291
Lot of widows.

07:14.292 --> 07:16.585
(inhales deeply)
New school smell.

07:16.586 --> 07:18.938
Paperless classrooms,
personal tablets,

07:18.939 --> 07:21.015
and uncrammable lockers.

07:21.016 --> 07:23.634
(grunting)

07:23.635 --> 07:26.570
Aw. Man, this is embarrassing.

07:30.767 --> 07:32.694
- (phone beeps)
- Bart Simpson.

07:32.695 --> 07:36.605
Welcome. I'm Zane Furlong,
this school's CEO:

07:36.606 --> 07:39.108
Collaborative
Educational Outreacher.

07:39.109 --> 07:41.110
I'm gonna stop you right there,
Skinner 2.0.

07:41.111 --> 07:43.037
It doesn't matter
how you dress it up.

07:43.038 --> 07:44.822
All schools are kid prisons.

07:44.823 --> 07:47.950
Well, I'm putting you
in solitary,

07:47.951 --> 07:50.494
where you'll learn geometry
by shooting meteors.

07:50.495 --> 07:51.971
Shoot enough,

07:51.972 --> 07:54.890
and you'll unlock
customizable skins.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.294
Skins?

07:58.295 --> 08:00.062
That's how boys play dress-up.

08:01.890 --> 08:03.841
- (phone beeps)
- Lisa Simpson.

08:03.842 --> 08:07.061
Our educational metric
has identified you

08:07.062 --> 08:10.732
as a divergent
multipathway assimilator.

08:10.733 --> 08:13.326
You mean, I'm in a gifted class?

08:13.327 --> 08:15.236
Ooh, we don't like that term.

08:15.237 --> 08:17.163
(chuckles)
Everyone is gifted.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.906
I firmly believe that.

08:18.907 --> 08:21.025
Now go upstairs to the...

08:21.026 --> 08:22.577
(whispers):
gifted class.

08:22.578 --> 08:24.912
(squeals)

08:24.913 --> 08:27.081
Finally, I feel seen.

08:27.082 --> 08:29.676
And for the first time,
I'll be accepted by my peers

08:29.677 --> 08:30.968
with open arms.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.347
I'm home.

08:44.049 --> 08:45.674
Okay, gifted class.

08:45.675 --> 08:46.860
Recess is over.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.770
STUDENTS:
Aw!

08:48.771 --> 08:50.721
Now, this school is so advanced

08:50.722 --> 08:53.775
that every aspect of it
is run by an algorithm.

08:53.776 --> 08:56.519
Who can give me an example
of an algorithm?

08:56.520 --> 08:57.762
(students clamoring)

08:57.763 --> 09:00.064
Oh! Like when you buy
a new garbage can online

09:00.065 --> 09:03.359
and the rest of your life,
you see ads for garbage cans.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.195
Or like when you watch
a bunch of close-up magic videos

09:06.196 --> 09:08.715
on YouTube and get ads
for a suicide hotline.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.407
Exactly.

09:10.408 --> 09:12.409
And because you liked
this lesson,

09:12.410 --> 09:15.262
the algorithm thinks
you might also enjoy...

09:21.711 --> 09:22.970
How was your first day

09:22.971 --> 09:25.640
at the new STEM school
I founded?

09:25.641 --> 09:27.716
It was amazing. We did science,

09:27.717 --> 09:29.260
then we did computer science,

09:29.261 --> 09:31.905
and then we did
cognitive computer science.

09:31.906 --> 09:33.931
Oh, what a surprise.
Lisa likes school.

09:33.932 --> 09:36.910
All right, boy. What did you
get suspended for today?

09:36.911 --> 09:38.243
Nothing.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.581
I like this school, too.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.440
Instead of teachers
giving us letter grades,

09:43.441 --> 09:45.919
an algorithm gives us stars.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.612
Education is a game now,
and I'm great at it.

09:48.613 --> 09:51.332
Look at all these skins
I've already unlocked.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.908
HOMER:
Whoa. Oh, that guy.

09:52.909 --> 09:54.168
(chuckles)
Noice.

09:54.169 --> 09:56.838
I even unlocked
the "Skin Unlocking" badge.

09:56.839 --> 09:57.846
HOMER:
Whoo-hoo!

10:00.634 --> 10:03.269
Tell us, what do you do,
Mr. Simpson?

10:03.270 --> 10:06.130
Ah, yes.
I monitor the core temperature

10:06.131 --> 10:07.256
at the nuclear power plant.

10:07.257 --> 10:08.799
If it gets into the red,

10:08.800 --> 10:11.611
I tell my family first
so they can leave town

10:11.612 --> 10:13.187
before the streets
get too crowded.

10:13.188 --> 10:16.932
- Now, this is a great example...
- Uh-huh.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.935
...of the kind of job
that will soon cease to exist.

10:19.936 --> 10:21.770
What the words now?

10:21.771 --> 10:23.147
Mr. Simpson's daily tasks

10:23.148 --> 10:25.458
can be more efficiently
performed by robots.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.795
My guess is, his job
will be obsolete in 18 months.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.113
What about them? How much time
do <i> their</i> careers have?

10:31.114 --> 10:32.966
- I'm a librarian.
- Five years.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.910
I just bought
a New York City taxi medallion.

10:35.911 --> 10:37.328
Five years <i> ago.</i>

10:37.329 --> 10:40.381
I do social media
for a cannabis delivery company.

10:40.382 --> 10:42.008
(chuckles):
You'll be fine.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.978
But all these other jobs
will soon be made obsolete

10:44.979 --> 10:47.129
by automation.

10:47.130 --> 10:48.556
Oh, no.
The robots are coming!

10:48.557 --> 10:49.965
I've got to warn everyone!

10:49.966 --> 10:52.176
(panicked grunting)

10:52.177 --> 10:53.844
Stupid kids!

10:53.845 --> 10:56.680

10:56.681 --> 10:57.848
(beep)

10:57.849 --> 10:59.901
(Homer grunts)

10:59.902 --> 11:02.737
I'm getting five stars
in all my classes.

11:02.738 --> 11:05.907
I finally unlocked
dreadlock sideburns.

11:05.908 --> 11:08.743
<i>Someone's</i> user name
is moving up the leaderboard.

11:08.744 --> 11:10.861
BART:
Cowabunga.

11:10.862 --> 11:12.672
Now get back downstairs

11:12.673 --> 11:14.674
to prepare
for the jobs of tomorrow.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.426
Whoo-hoo!
It's a race to the bottom!

11:18.512 --> 11:21.013
Hmm?

11:21.924 --> 11:24.208
Hmm.

11:24.209 --> 11:27.002
Bart, I've never seen you
so engaged in learning.

11:27.003 --> 11:29.171
It's awesome.
We're seeing how many e-scooters

11:29.172 --> 11:30.673
we can collect around town,

11:30.674 --> 11:32.767
charge, then get
back on the streets.

11:32.768 --> 11:34.694
Oh, I see. You're learning logic
and spatial reasoning.

11:34.695 --> 11:38.514
All I know is, if I don't get
ten scooters in under a minute,

11:38.515 --> 11:41.016
I won't unlock
the Master Collector badge.

11:41.017 --> 11:42.518
(grunting)

11:42.519 --> 11:43.945
Got it!

11:43.946 --> 11:46.079
Learning rules!

11:50.402 --> 11:53.046
Oh, you must be teaching
the kids about nutrition

11:53.047 --> 11:55.456
and staying
within a budget, right?

11:55.457 --> 11:58.960
No. We're teaching them to buy
groceries for lazy rich people.

11:58.961 --> 12:02.889
This avocado will be
perfectly ripe in two days.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.416
I wonder what they taste like.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.543
Hmm.

12:07.544 --> 12:09.211
Uber-driving.

12:09.212 --> 12:10.063
Grubhub'ing.

12:10.064 --> 12:11.472
Lyft-driving?

12:11.473 --> 12:13.549
These aren't jobs of the future.

12:13.550 --> 12:16.051
These are side hustles!

12:16.052 --> 12:17.110
(gasps)

12:18.238 --> 12:19.722
<i>HOMER:
Guys, guys.</i>

12:19.723 --> 12:22.149
The robots are coming.
The robots are coming!

12:22.150 --> 12:23.468
Robots here?

12:23.469 --> 12:26.061
Uh, this place ain't exactly
forward-thinking.

12:26.062 --> 12:27.580
Yeah. We're one of America's

12:27.581 --> 12:29.991
last coal-powered
nuclear plants.

12:29.992 --> 12:32.660
Yeah? Well, you can all bury
your heads in the sandwiches,

12:32.661 --> 12:34.903
but I know the robots are coming
to replace us!

12:34.904 --> 12:36.613
Calm down, Homer.

12:36.614 --> 12:39.007
Here, have a drink from
the new soda machine we got.

12:39.951 --> 12:40.927
(Homer shrieks)

12:40.928 --> 12:42.911
The machines are already here,

12:42.912 --> 12:44.931
and when they take over,
you can't imagine

12:44.932 --> 12:47.015
how bleak the future will be.

12:48.793 --> 12:51.061
¶ ¶

12:58.428 --> 13:02.322
I choose to believe
our best days are ahead of us.

13:07.529 --> 13:09.030
It's giving us orders.

13:09.031 --> 13:11.748
The revolution has begun.

13:13.777 --> 13:15.128
Hmm. Hmm.

13:15.129 --> 13:16.796
Uh-oh. I know that look.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.156
She's gonna Lisa-up
a good thing.

13:19.157 --> 13:20.783
Attention, students!

13:20.784 --> 13:23.619
This school isn't training you
to program apps.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.330
It's training you to <i> obey</i> apps!

13:26.331 --> 13:29.717
When you're grown up, you'll
be lucky to make minimum wage!

13:29.718 --> 13:31.978
(worried gasps)

13:31.979 --> 13:33.888
Which is a <i> lot</i> of money!

13:33.889 --> 13:36.632
That's like getting
your allowance every hour.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.509
(happy gasps, shouts)

13:38.510 --> 13:40.394
Wha...? No, no.

13:40.395 --> 13:45.015
You deserve the same chance
to succeed as the gifted class.

13:45.016 --> 13:47.068
That means preparing
for real careers,

13:47.069 --> 13:50.646
not gig economy gigs.

13:50.647 --> 13:53.332
Gigs are awesome!
DJs play gigs!

13:53.333 --> 13:54.817
ALL:
DJs!

13:54.818 --> 13:56.693
(cheering)

13:56.694 --> 13:59.379
Aah! This has nothing to do
with deejaying!

14:00.824 --> 14:02.842
(loud dance music playing)

14:02.843 --> 14:04.719
(cheering)

14:04.720 --> 14:06.386
LISA (groans):
Oh...

14:14.354 --> 14:16.931
Aw. At least
they're learning art.

14:16.932 --> 14:17.856
(chuckles)

14:19.050 --> 14:20.693
Tip jars?!

14:20.694 --> 14:24.029
That's it.
I got to fix this school.

14:29.352 --> 14:32.020
(screams)

14:32.021 --> 14:34.040
Stop messing with the school.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.025
I finally filled up
enough virtual pee bottles

14:37.026 --> 14:39.903
to unlock the Amazon Warehouse
Whizzer badge.

14:39.904 --> 14:41.905
LISA:
Ew.

14:41.906 --> 14:43.958
Bart, I need to rewrite
the algorithm.

14:43.959 --> 14:47.536
Then the school will teach
every kid real STEM.

14:47.537 --> 14:50.080
I am doing this for <i> you.</i>

14:50.081 --> 14:52.583
Yeah? Well,
I'm doing this for <i> me.</i>

14:52.584 --> 14:53.767
(mechanical whirring)

14:54.878 --> 14:56.753
Education for all!

14:56.754 --> 14:58.064
Side hustles for most!

14:58.065 --> 14:59.756
- (Lisa and Bart grunt)
- Kids, what's wrong?

14:59.757 --> 15:02.476
Your tracking implants showed
heightened emotions.

15:02.477 --> 15:04.720
- Tracking what?
- Teacher, teacher, my sister's

15:04.721 --> 15:07.740
gonna ruin the only school I've
ever liked in my whole life!

15:07.741 --> 15:10.559
It's just not fair
that only a small group of kids

15:10.560 --> 15:12.769
are getting
an advanced education!

15:12.770 --> 15:15.322
Well, isn't that the point
of a gifted class?

15:15.323 --> 15:16.231
Eep.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.917
Lisa, the algorithm's purpose

15:17.918 --> 15:20.277
is to prepare kids
for the jobs of tomorrow.

15:20.278 --> 15:23.614
But it's just teaching them
to be the task rabbits of today.

15:23.615 --> 15:26.742
Nobody knows what the jobs
of tomorrow are gonna be.

15:26.743 --> 15:28.785
Well, I'm sure
the algorithm does.

15:28.786 --> 15:30.220
Here, I'll ask it.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.957
Wait, wait, this can't be.

15:33.958 --> 15:36.126
- There's only one.
- (both gasp)

15:36.127 --> 15:37.811
We are so screwed.

15:39.181 --> 15:41.515
One Buzz Cola
with vanilla and lime.

15:41.516 --> 15:43.091
Diet Buzz for me.

15:43.092 --> 15:44.468
With vanilla and lime.

15:44.469 --> 15:45.352
(Homer grunts)

15:45.353 --> 15:46.779
Aw, geez. This again?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.597
Yeah, we have
an active lifestyle,

15:48.598 --> 15:50.807
and part of that
is drinking soda all day.

15:50.808 --> 15:52.618
If it's refreshments you want,

15:52.619 --> 15:55.145
why not let a man
pour your soda!

15:55.146 --> 15:57.314
A <i> human</i> man.

15:57.315 --> 15:58.815
For too long
we have done nothing

15:58.816 --> 16:01.276
as machines have taken over,
washing our dishes,

16:01.277 --> 16:03.820
pumping our insulin,
and now this!

16:03.821 --> 16:06.323
Man can pour soda better
than any machine

16:06.324 --> 16:09.543
made specially for that purpose,
and I will prove it!

16:09.544 --> 16:12.329
Today the robot uprising ends.

16:12.330 --> 16:16.050
Today is our Independence Day!

16:16.051 --> 16:17.726
(acoustic guitar playing)

16:20.981 --> 16:24.841
¶ Well, Homer pulled
a lot of sodas ¶

16:24.842 --> 16:28.804
¶ Because he hated
that machine ¶

16:28.805 --> 16:32.066
¶ He got confused, thought
it was gonna take his job ¶

16:32.067 --> 16:36.070
¶ So Homer was
a soda-pouring man, Lord, Lord ¶

16:36.071 --> 16:39.915
¶ Oh, Homer was
a soda-pouring man ¶

16:42.193 --> 16:44.003
¶ He did not make his point ¶

16:44.004 --> 16:46.005
¶ And his sodas were
warm and flat ¶

16:46.006 --> 16:50.033
¶ So Homer was
a soda-pouring man, Lord, Lord ¶

16:50.034 --> 16:53.996
¶ Soda-pouring's
not a real thing ¶

16:53.997 --> 16:55.539
¶ No, sir. ¶

16:55.540 --> 16:56.973
(groans)

17:00.187 --> 17:01.878
Homer might have been slower,

17:01.879 --> 17:04.098
but his pours had a human touch.

17:04.098 --> 17:07.359
Always delivered with a smile
and a sense of brotherhood.

17:07.361 --> 17:09.270
-(cheering)
-Yeah!
- All right!

17:09.271 --> 17:11.847
But he died.
So machine wins!

17:11.848 --> 17:14.516
(groaning woozily)

17:14.517 --> 17:17.394
No, no, wait.
His pulse was beating so fast

17:17.395 --> 17:19.688
from all the soda he drank
that it was a blur.

17:19.689 --> 17:23.284
(grunts) Perhaps one day
machines will be better

17:23.285 --> 17:26.528
at pouring soda than man,
but not today!

17:26.529 --> 17:28.571
Our jobs are safe!

17:28.573 --> 17:30.257
(cheering)

17:33.962 --> 17:35.871
<i>Listen up.</i>

17:35.872 --> 17:38.391
<i>These nerds have found out
something terrifying.</i>

17:38.392 --> 17:41.227
<i>This school was supposed
to prepare you</i>

17:41.228 --> 17:42.970
<i>for the jobs of the future.</i>

17:42.971 --> 17:44.897
<i>But in the future,
all the jobs we've learned here</i>

17:44.898 --> 17:46.590
<i>will be done by robots.</i>

17:46.591 --> 17:49.476
<i>The only job left
for humans will be...</i>

17:49.477 --> 17:51.595
<i>BOTH:
Elder care!</i>

17:51.596 --> 17:53.647
(all gasping)

17:53.648 --> 17:56.725
<i>The one job
even robots won't do.</i>

17:56.726 --> 17:58.602
<i>What about STEM?</i>

17:58.603 --> 18:01.329
<i>Here's what
it really stands for.</i>

18:05.085 --> 18:07.210
- No!
- No, it can't be!

18:09.280 --> 18:11.715
(disgusted groaning)

18:13.951 --> 18:16.095
I don't want to be
an adult butt wiper.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.580
No one should see
old people naked!

18:18.581 --> 18:20.433
Unless that's your kink.

18:20.434 --> 18:23.177
Let's show this algorithm
what we really think of it--

18:23.178 --> 18:26.296
with our generation's
most powerful tool:

18:26.297 --> 18:29.299
user ratings.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.318
(students affirming)

18:32.946 --> 18:34.688

18:34.689 --> 18:36.857
<i>ALGORITHM:
User rating dangerously low.</i>

18:36.858 --> 18:38.117
<i>One star.</i>

<i>Self-esteem protocol failing.</i>

18:40.195 --> 18:42.196

18:45.033 --> 18:47.034
<i>Can't get out of virtual bed.</i>

18:47.035 --> 18:49.319
<i>Initiating
self-destruct sequence.</i>

18:49.320 --> 18:50.963
<i>Self-destruct.</i>

18:50.964 --> 18:52.255
(alarm blaring)

18:56.044 --> 18:58.136
(screaming)

19:00.998 --> 19:03.809
I have to go back!
My skins are in there!

19:03.810 --> 19:05.769
No! They're already gone!

19:08.056 --> 19:10.316
(grunts)

19:10.317 --> 19:14.361
BART (sobbing):
Camo-hat Santa! No!

19:16.047 --> 19:19.233
I guess the children will have
to go back to the old school.

19:19.234 --> 19:22.911
Yes, well, I don't know
that that's possible anymore.

19:25.499 --> 19:26.481
My school.

19:26.482 --> 19:29.025
My forward-thinking school.

19:29.026 --> 19:32.746
There, there.
You'll suggest other schools.

19:32.747 --> 19:34.081
You really think so?

19:34.082 --> 19:36.841
I'm just saying things.

19:37.752 --> 19:39.586
Goodbye, gifted class.

19:39.587 --> 19:42.539
Yeah, but we escaped having
to take care of old people.

19:42.540 --> 19:45.500
No, that's still the only job
that's going to exist.

19:45.501 --> 19:48.020
Now we just won't know
how to do it.
