00:04.327 --> 00:05.761
- Long line.
- Yeah.

00:05.762 --> 00:08.496
For our triumphant return
to the Groundlings Theater.

00:08.497 --> 00:11.198
- I'm excited!
- Because it's exciting.

00:11.199 --> 00:12.868
Excuse us, we're not cutting the line.

00:12.869 --> 00:15.538
We're in tonight's show,
we're performers.

00:15.539 --> 00:18.875
Sorry, can we just look?
'Cause we're on that poster.

00:22.378 --> 00:23.846
We're "and others"?

00:23.847 --> 00:25.515
Really?

00:26.882 --> 00:28.149
Why do we need the flames?

00:28.150 --> 00:30.118
That's where our pictures could be.

00:30.119 --> 00:32.421
(scoffs)

00:33.756 --> 00:36.157
How the hell did we
become "the others"?

00:36.158 --> 00:37.691
God, now I'm nervous.

00:37.692 --> 00:40.029
Probably 'cause we haven't
done improv in two years.

00:40.030 --> 00:41.429
I don't remember how to do improv.

00:41.430 --> 00:42.965
This is gonna be a disaster.

00:42.966 --> 00:44.466
- Hi!
- Hey!

00:44.467 --> 00:46.002
(all) Hi!

00:46.003 --> 00:47.468
(all chattering)

00:47.469 --> 00:49.837
- How are you?
- Good...

00:49.838 --> 00:51.172
Aah!

00:51.173 --> 00:53.575
(all chattering)

00:53.576 --> 00:56.111
- I'm sorry we're late.
- Does anybody...

00:56.112 --> 00:58.380
Does anybody have any
questions about any of these?

00:58.381 --> 01:00.078
'Cause I might add some for time,

01:00.079 --> 01:01.182
but for now, this what we...

01:01.183 --> 01:02.248
- I have a question.
- Yes.

01:02.249 --> 01:03.392
Did you get laid last night?

01:03.393 --> 01:04.753
(all exclaiming)

01:04.754 --> 01:07.556
Uh, is the answer yes? No, it's not.

01:07.557 --> 01:09.691
Oh, and, Jim, will you do me a favor?

01:09.692 --> 01:13.755
When you introduce us, can you just
introduce Nat as Oscar-winner Nat Faxon?

01:13.756 --> 01:16.139
'Cause he told me privately that
that's the way he wants it.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.499
It's super important to me.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.902
It's not just in private,
it's everyday of my life, so...

01:19.903 --> 01:23.771
Oh, my God, Maya,
you were so funny on Fallon.

01:23.772 --> 01:24.839
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.107
You were so funny.

01:26.108 --> 01:28.577
Aw, thanks, you guys.
It was really fun.

01:28.578 --> 01:30.613
- Real funny.
- What... what are you guys up to?

01:30.614 --> 01:32.514
You writing something together or...

01:32.515 --> 01:33.938
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but it's not like...

01:33.939 --> 01:35.083
- Yeah.
- It's not...

01:35.084 --> 01:36.818
We're writing on an animated show.

01:36.819 --> 01:37.886
Nice.

01:37.887 --> 01:39.387
Cool. For FOX?

01:39.388 --> 01:41.624
- Um, Nickelodeon.
- Is that a kids' show?

01:41.625 --> 01:43.358
Yeah, yeah.

01:43.359 --> 01:44.527
- Cool.
- Cartoon.

01:44.528 --> 01:46.361
What's it called?

01:46.362 --> 01:49.230
- Uh...
- "The Fartlemans."

01:49.231 --> 01:50.366
Really?

01:50.367 --> 01:51.533
(chuckling)

01:51.534 --> 01:53.369
Fart? Like Fartlemans?

01:53.370 --> 01:54.402
(Larry) Yes. Fartlemans.

01:54.403 --> 01:55.905
That's what it's called, yes.

01:55.906 --> 01:58.367
Wait, what if you guys were
like, "Yeah, we write on

01:58.368 --> 01:59.711
"a show called 'The Fartlemans, '

01:59.712 --> 02:01.443
and it's like a family of farts."

02:01.444 --> 02:03.712
And it was like, "Mom Fartleman,
Dad Fartleman."

02:03.713 --> 02:05.347
Like, the actual Fartlemans.

02:05.348 --> 02:07.782
No, I think that is... Right?

02:07.783 --> 02:09.484
- It's a mom and a dad...
- Wait, no.

02:09.485 --> 02:11.508
You really write on a show
called "The Fartlemans"?

02:11.509 --> 02:12.220
Oh, yeah.

02:12.221 --> 02:13.555
(laughter)

02:13.556 --> 02:15.323
I'm so... I'm sorry, oh.

02:15.324 --> 02:16.991
- No, it's...
- (Rachel) No, no.

02:16.992 --> 02:18.253
Bit gone wrong.

02:18.254 --> 02:19.797
Cut to commercial, but right before...

02:19.798 --> 02:20.961
(high pitched fart sound)

02:20.962 --> 02:22.163
(laughter)

02:22.164 --> 02:24.799
You could be like, "Silent but deadly,"

02:24.800 --> 02:27.068
is, like, the name of the episode.

02:27.069 --> 02:29.571
- We had that one.
- I've never heard of that show.

02:29.572 --> 02:31.774
It's so... It's a real show right now?

02:31.775 --> 02:33.459
Is is a real show.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.043
Yeah, your kids have seen it, I'm sure.

02:35.044 --> 02:36.411
Nope. I would know

02:36.412 --> 02:38.412
if they've been watching
"The Fartlemans."

02:38.413 --> 02:39.815
On that note, let's do it.

02:39.816 --> 02:42.450
- Let's do it, shall we? Okay.
- (imitates fart)

02:42.451 --> 02:45.221
- All right, crew!
- Let's fart it up!

02:45.222 --> 02:46.954
- ♪ The Fartlemans ♪
- ♪ The Fartlemans ♪

02:46.955 --> 02:48.757
♪ The Fartlemans, we're here, there ♪

02:48.758 --> 02:50.925
♪ And fartin' all the time ♪

02:50.926 --> 02:53.061
"Really, Maya, you've
never heard of our show?"

02:53.062 --> 02:54.696
You know what I've
never heard of, Maya?

02:54.697 --> 02:56.365
"Saturday Night Live."

02:56.366 --> 02:58.733
Well, you have, so...

02:58.734 --> 03:00.103
Well, a lot of people haven't.

03:01.705 --> 03:03.204
- Um, hey, Jim.
- Yeah.

03:03.205 --> 03:05.906
Have you and Nat ever pitch
to someone named Gavin Resic?

03:05.907 --> 03:07.675
Yes, a few times. He's great.

03:07.676 --> 03:10.144
Oh, good. We're pitching
our movie tomorrow.

03:10.145 --> 03:12.448
Oh, nice! So does Melissa
say she wants to be in it?

03:12.449 --> 03:16.285
Uh, no, we, um, texted her,
but we didn't hear...

03:16.286 --> 03:17.652
- Oof. Really?
- Is that bad?

03:17.653 --> 03:18.686
Well, I mean, obviously
it's better to go

03:18.687 --> 03:20.020
into one of these things saying,

03:20.021 --> 03:21.423
"Melissa McCarthy wants to star in it."

03:21.424 --> 03:22.858
- But, you know.
- Right, right.

03:22.859 --> 03:24.793
This is crazy,
where'd all my pictures go?

03:24.794 --> 03:26.939
You think they took 'em down
'cause we're not famous?

03:26.940 --> 03:28.523
Jim made it very clear,
we need Melissa.

03:28.524 --> 03:29.698
What does that mean?

03:29.699 --> 03:32.032
(overlapping arguing)

03:32.033 --> 03:34.335
- Are you wearing makeup?
- Yeah, but you can't tell.

03:34.336 --> 03:36.999
Well, if I couldn't tell, why would
I ask if you're wearing makeup?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.767
Can you tell that
I have powder on my face?

03:38.768 --> 03:40.007
(Jim) Maya Rudolph!

03:40.008 --> 03:41.376
- Maya!
- Maya!

03:41.377 --> 03:42.845
(cheering and applause)

03:42.846 --> 03:45.948
He is my co-Oscar winner, Nat Faxon.

03:45.949 --> 03:47.382
Yay, he won an Oscar!

03:47.383 --> 03:48.684
"Way, Way Back"!

03:48.685 --> 03:49.952
He didn't win for that, so...

03:49.953 --> 03:51.353
(Jim) Stephanie Courtney!

03:51.354 --> 03:54.089
And the others,
Hugh, Larry, and Rachel!

03:54.090 --> 03:55.924
(scattered applause)

03:55.925 --> 03:57.926
Hmm. Guess we don't have last names.

03:57.927 --> 04:00.267
(Jim) All right, we're gonna
start with a song improv....

04:01.865 --> 04:03.597
Should I go sleeves up or sleeves down?

04:03.598 --> 04:04.725
(Rachel) I don't care.

04:04.726 --> 04:06.149
Okay, before we get into the pitch,

04:06.150 --> 04:07.902
we'll say we were in
Groundlings together,

04:07.903 --> 04:09.638
we're writer-performers,
we have this idea.

04:09.639 --> 04:11.372
Right, we should mention "The Heat."

04:11.373 --> 04:12.679
Why would we mention "The Heat"?

04:12.680 --> 04:13.903
'Cause we could've been in it.

04:13.904 --> 04:15.144
- Why would we...
- How?

04:15.145 --> 04:16.444
'Cause of Melissa.

04:16.445 --> 04:18.646
We shouldn't talk about Melissa.

04:18.647 --> 04:19.880
We don't have Melissa,
Melissa's not here.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.182
Let's not talk about Melissa.

04:21.183 --> 04:22.651
Melissa's off-limits, too.

04:22.652 --> 04:24.618
We should mention Melissa.

04:24.619 --> 04:26.420
Mention her, but don't,
like, name drop her.

04:26.421 --> 04:28.591
Yes, yes. No, casual.

04:28.592 --> 04:29.957
Keep it very casual.
They're gonna love it.

04:29.958 --> 04:31.301
They're gonna buy it in the room.

04:31.302 --> 04:33.028
We're gonna be rich as shit.

04:33.029 --> 04:34.495
Do you have any idea
of how you come across?

04:34.496 --> 04:35.798
- Very unlikeable.
- Likeable.

04:35.799 --> 04:37.466
Hi, guys, I'm Grace. I work with Gavin.

04:37.467 --> 04:38.632
(all) Hi.

04:38.633 --> 04:39.935
Sorry, to keep you all waiting.

04:39.936 --> 04:41.719
- No, it's fun.
- Why don't you come on back?

04:41.720 --> 04:42.437
- Great.
- What?

04:42.438 --> 04:46.675
So... how do you guys know each other?

04:46.676 --> 04:49.278
Uh, well, we were all in
the Groundlings together.

04:49.279 --> 04:52.447
With, uh, Melissa McCarthy.

04:52.448 --> 04:54.071
We were... we were
all in the same group.

04:54.072 --> 04:55.382
You know Melissa?

04:55.383 --> 04:57.553
Oh, we love Melissa, yeah,
and her husband Ben.

04:57.554 --> 04:59.220
- Oh, Ben, yeah.
- Yeah, they're so good.

04:59.221 --> 05:00.956
- We know both of them.
- Two of our best friends.

05:00.957 --> 05:01.465
Oh, wow.

05:01.466 --> 05:03.358
We've known them forever,
for a long, long time.

05:03.359 --> 05:04.392
- We were in their wedding.
- Yes.

05:04.393 --> 05:05.576
Larry was in it. I was in it.

05:05.577 --> 05:07.062
- Yes.
- Hugh went to it.

05:07.063 --> 05:08.264
Lot of life memories.

05:08.265 --> 05:10.365
We're like pieces of a puzzle and...

05:10.366 --> 05:11.466
It's the same thing,

05:11.467 --> 05:13.201
and that's what I want you to get.

05:13.202 --> 05:15.670
I mean, I just want you to
make sure you're hearing us.

05:15.671 --> 05:17.072
- You know, and just...
- We do.

05:17.073 --> 05:19.507
- We know Kristen Wiig and...
- We knew her before.

05:19.508 --> 05:21.276
- Before...
- Before she was Kristen Wiig,

05:21.277 --> 05:22.577
we knew Kristen Wiig.

05:22.578 --> 05:26.115
Wow, okay. Wow.

05:26.116 --> 05:28.884
And we all could've been in "The Heat."

05:28.885 --> 05:30.252
Oh.

05:32.121 --> 05:33.622
You were in "The Heat"?

05:33.623 --> 05:35.591
I was not in "The Heat."

05:35.592 --> 05:37.692
Um, we are here

05:37.693 --> 05:41.596
because we wrote a script
called "Mr. First Lady."

05:41.597 --> 05:43.598
Yeah, we read your script,
and we loved it.

05:43.599 --> 05:45.332
Yeah, it's so timely.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.634
- You read it?
- So, so timely.

05:46.635 --> 05:48.254
I mean, the first male first lady, huh?

05:48.255 --> 05:49.937
So funny. It's very funny.

05:49.938 --> 05:51.339
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.841
How come we haven't
met you guys before, you know?

05:53.842 --> 05:55.343
What have you been working on?

05:55.344 --> 05:57.978
Uh, well, for like the last
three and a half years,

05:57.979 --> 06:00.382
we've been writing on
an half-hour animated show.

06:00.383 --> 06:02.016
Oh, for FOX?

06:02.017 --> 06:05.088
Uh... ours is on Nickelodeon.

06:09.191 --> 06:10.558
Oh.

06:10.559 --> 06:13.560
I'm sorry, so you write for...

06:13.561 --> 06:16.730
You write for kids?

06:16.731 --> 06:19.468
Yeah, I mean, it's a kids'
show, but, you know.

06:19.469 --> 06:20.901
Okay, well, guys, you know...

06:20.902 --> 06:22.437
You know, it's a fun idea.

06:22.438 --> 06:25.940
But, like I said, fun ideas
are sort of dime a dozen, so...

06:25.941 --> 06:27.924
Well, you didn't say
the dime a dozen part, but...

06:27.925 --> 06:30.077
Look, my point is,
we get pitches like this,

06:30.078 --> 06:32.781
- um... all the time, you know?
- Every day.

06:32.782 --> 06:36.084
Without a star attached,
it's just, um...

06:36.085 --> 06:39.053
You know, this is just
not a great fit, you know?

06:39.054 --> 06:41.456
But it was really nice
to meet you guys.

06:41.457 --> 06:43.759
You know, keep working,
keep doing what you're doing.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.262
Melissa McCarthy
wants to play the president!

06:48.431 --> 06:49.932
Oh!

06:49.933 --> 06:52.500
Well, you should've
led with that, girl.

06:52.501 --> 06:54.168
Girl... tell me about it.

06:54.169 --> 06:55.370
(chuckling)

06:55.371 --> 06:57.139
- You... Wait, wait, wait.
- Yeah.

06:57.140 --> 06:59.408
- You guys, you guys.
- Let's do this again.

06:59.409 --> 07:00.512
- Let's start again.
- Yeah.

07:00.513 --> 07:01.743
That is so interesting.

07:01.744 --> 07:03.211
- Isn't that?
- Yeah.

07:03.212 --> 07:04.713
Mm-hmm. Um...

07:04.714 --> 07:07.014
What was your name again?

07:07.015 --> 07:10.452
Guys... can you not walk so fast?

07:10.453 --> 07:12.954
I'm in heels, so...

07:12.955 --> 07:14.956
- Are you mad at me?
- Yes.

07:14.957 --> 07:17.024
Why? I got us another meeting.

07:17.025 --> 07:19.127
That those idiots
expect Melissa to be at.

07:19.128 --> 07:20.894
Let me just... Hold on, pause, timeout.

07:20.895 --> 07:22.130
You don't need to be so angry.

07:22.131 --> 07:24.399
- Pause, this is a pause sign.
- Okay.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.061
All right, let me just do
a 30,000-foot view, okay?

07:27.062 --> 07:28.365
Rachel shouldn't have said that.

07:28.366 --> 07:29.704
- Yes, right.
- But she did.

07:29.705 --> 07:31.698
As you're saying it,
you're like, "What am I saying?

07:31.699 --> 07:33.104
- Why am I saying this?"
- I don't like you, Larry.

07:33.105 --> 07:35.011
- I don't like you.
- But there's another side.

07:35.012 --> 07:36.345
- Want to know what it is?
- Yes.

07:36.346 --> 07:38.447
It's great what you did,
and I thank you,

07:38.448 --> 07:40.949
because now we have extra motivation

07:40.950 --> 07:42.618
to get Melissa by next week.

07:42.619 --> 07:45.387
Oh, that's right, we didn't
have enough motivation before.

07:45.388 --> 07:48.223
That's flipping it, that's...

07:48.224 --> 07:49.391
Look at this.

07:49.392 --> 07:50.959
- That's insane.
- Oh, my God.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.329
You see that? That's a sign.

07:54.330 --> 07:56.264
Well, it is, it's a...

07:56.265 --> 07:59.002
It's a billboard sign.

08:02.813 --> 08:05.601
(woman) <i>Skippy, I know you hear me.</i>

08:05.602 --> 08:08.421
(woman) <i>Skippy Fartleman,
get down here this instant.</i>

08:08.422 --> 08:10.457
<i>(farting sounds)</i>

08:10.458 --> 08:12.726
(chuckling)

08:12.727 --> 08:15.495
<i>(farting continues)</i>

08:15.496 --> 08:16.697
(laughing)

08:17.965 --> 08:20.034
<i>(farting continues)</i>

08:20.802 --> 08:23.971
How's it still going?

08:23.972 --> 08:26.039
(laughing) How is it still going?

08:26.040 --> 08:28.475
<i>(farting sputters)</i>

08:29.811 --> 08:31.478
How am I the only one laughing?

08:31.479 --> 08:36.215
Was that, like, two people
and, uh, a cat?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.450
It's a shingle effect.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.086
It's a layering technique I developed.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.854
We put farts on top of each other.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.554
That's amazing, right?

08:43.556 --> 08:44.623
<i>(farting sound)</i>

08:44.624 --> 08:46.609
That's me, I recorded it for Rachel.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.778
This job... I can't do it anymore.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.879
I quit!

08:50.880 --> 08:51.947
Well, I can't quit because

08:51.948 --> 08:53.411
I'm a single mom with a child, so...

08:53.412 --> 08:55.650
- Uh, I have two Childs and...
- Children.

08:55.651 --> 08:57.418
- ...a mortgage and a wife...
- Plural of child is children.

08:57.419 --> 08:58.586
...who does not work.

08:58.587 --> 09:00.590
Well, maybe you should ask her to work.

09:00.591 --> 09:01.590
Do me a favor, just check your phone,

09:01.591 --> 09:02.990
see if Melissa texted back.

09:02.991 --> 09:05.460
Larry, if she texts me,
my phone will make a sound.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.261
That's what phones do, they...
Oh, my God!

09:07.262 --> 09:09.230
- She texted.
- What?! Yes, yes!

09:09.231 --> 09:10.334
- We got her.
- Melissa did?

09:10.335 --> 09:11.732
We got her. We got her.

09:11.733 --> 09:13.434
- She texted three times.
- We got her, she loves it.

09:13.435 --> 09:15.058
- What is it? What is it?
- She loves it.

09:15.059 --> 09:16.205
What'd she write?

09:16.206 --> 09:18.075
(mouthing words)

09:18.746 --> 09:20.880
Oh, my God, are you not
gonna read it out loud?

09:20.881 --> 09:23.850
Uh, she says, "Hey, lady, sorry,
I'm out of town filming."

09:23.851 --> 09:26.454
I can't... see, I'm visual.
I'm visual, that's how I learn.

09:26.455 --> 09:29.322
Just let her read it.
Read it then, read it!

09:29.323 --> 09:31.925
"Hey, lady, sorry... I'm out..."

09:31.926 --> 09:34.260
Are you in the first grade?
Is that the pace you go at?

09:34.261 --> 09:36.162
"Hey, lady, sorry,
I'm out of town filming.

09:36.163 --> 09:38.331
"My days are insane, can't really talk.

09:38.332 --> 09:41.101
"The kids are with me,
but Ben's home all by himself.

09:41.102 --> 09:44.171
You should call him. XOXO."

09:44.172 --> 09:45.739
- Uh-huh.
- What does that mean?

09:45.740 --> 09:47.274
Hugs and kisses.

09:47.275 --> 09:49.877
No, what does it mean,
like, what do we do?

09:49.878 --> 09:51.478
Oh.

09:51.479 --> 09:55.014
Well, she said... call Ben.
We pitch it to him.

09:55.015 --> 09:56.951
So let's talk to Ben. Let's go to Ben.

09:56.952 --> 09:58.255
- Let's go to Ben.
- No-no-no-no.

09:58.256 --> 09:59.585
I... Only one of us goes,

09:59.586 --> 10:01.755
'cause otherwise Ben
will feel gang banged.

10:01.756 --> 10:03.350
(snickering)

10:03.351 --> 10:04.774
I don't think you mean gang banged.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.286
- You mean gang banged.
- What?

10:06.287 --> 10:07.790
That's your... That is what you mean.

10:07.791 --> 10:08.991
'Cause that's what it means.

10:08.992 --> 10:10.964
Gang banged, like he's ganged up on.

10:10.965 --> 10:12.599
Yes, she's right. Stop it.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.994
You two gang bang me all the time.

10:14.995 --> 10:16.258
I'm always feeling gang banged.

10:16.259 --> 10:17.236
Rachel...

10:17.237 --> 10:19.574
I'm gonna look it up.

10:20.676 --> 10:23.178
(doorbell chimes)

10:26.881 --> 10:28.715
- (laughing) Yeah, I know.
- Hi!

10:28.716 --> 10:30.216
- Hi!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

10:30.217 --> 10:31.419
(whispers) Come on in.

10:32.384 --> 10:34.254
Sorry. No problem. Come on in.

10:34.255 --> 10:35.388
Who are you talking to?

10:35.389 --> 10:36.789
- Sandy.
- Oh, tell her I said...

10:36.790 --> 10:37.991
Well, I'll just say.

10:37.992 --> 10:39.826
Sandy, hey, how are you?
Say hi to Mike.

10:39.827 --> 10:42.329
No, it's Sandy Bullock. Sorry.

10:42.330 --> 10:43.898
- Sorry, it's...
- I thought it was Melissa's mom Sandy.

10:43.899 --> 10:45.365
She thought you were Melissa's mom.

10:45.366 --> 10:46.466
It's my friend Rachel.

10:46.467 --> 10:47.933
Anyway, do you want some wine?

10:47.934 --> 10:49.702
- Uh, yes.
- Not... not you.

10:49.703 --> 10:53.240
Uh, yes to you. I will...
someday you can have some wine.

10:53.241 --> 10:56.610
- I promise she's not crazy.
- Sandy Bullock.

10:56.611 --> 10:58.077
La-Dee-da-Dee-da.

10:58.078 --> 11:01.514
Ohh, I remember that.

11:01.515 --> 11:04.252
Look at us. We were so young.

11:04.253 --> 11:08.089
I don't know why we're
behind this one of Ellen.

11:08.090 --> 11:11.225
'Cause I was friends with her first.

11:11.226 --> 11:12.759
So I'm gonna move it there.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.464
And, Ellen, you're gonna
dance your way back there,

11:16.465 --> 11:18.465
since you have to dance,
that's your thing.

11:18.466 --> 11:20.366
Mooch gets back, I think, on Sunday,

11:20.367 --> 11:21.835
and we'll just set it up.

11:21.836 --> 11:25.038
Great, all right. Bye.

11:25.039 --> 11:26.172
- Ben...
- Yes?

11:26.173 --> 11:28.341
Um, this is very serious.

11:28.342 --> 11:32.613
But I don't know why I'm not
friends with Sandra Bullock.

11:32.614 --> 11:34.680
I've got like, you know,
like 10,000 reasons why...

11:34.681 --> 11:36.064
- Oh, really?
- Well, just for you.

11:36.065 --> 11:38.118
Just for tonight,
just tell me one thing.

11:38.119 --> 11:41.589
Tell me who Sandra Bullock hates.

11:41.590 --> 11:44.191
- No! That's why...
- She hates somebody.

11:44.192 --> 11:45.893
No, but I'm not gonna answer. I can't.

11:45.894 --> 11:47.393
Jennifer Aniston?

11:47.394 --> 11:48.659
- So, seriously, okay.
- Uh-huh.

11:48.660 --> 11:50.243
What's... How are you? What's going on?

11:50.244 --> 11:51.222
Good.

11:51.223 --> 11:52.566
So you're not gonna believe this.

11:52.567 --> 11:56.637
Um... but Hugh and Larry and I...

11:56.638 --> 11:58.605
Oh, did you...
You did the Groundlings show.

11:58.606 --> 12:01.608
- Yeah, we did. Why?
- Yeah.

12:01.609 --> 12:02.442
Rash told me.

12:02.443 --> 12:04.744
- Oh.
- How was it?

12:04.745 --> 12:06.312
We were... I keep... What's that word?

12:06.313 --> 12:07.514
Bad. We were really bad.

12:07.515 --> 12:10.517
It was so...
It was so painful, I don't...

12:10.518 --> 12:11.918
- You were not terrible.
- We were.

12:11.919 --> 12:13.353
- Yes, we were terrible.
- I'm sure you were awesome.

12:13.354 --> 12:14.888
I'm sure you guys are always awesome.

12:14.889 --> 12:16.192
- I was actually gonna go.
- Ohh.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.057
I was gonna do it.

12:17.058 --> 12:18.459
Um, but it's been weird for me.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.243
Like, I think people
think I can do something

12:20.244 --> 12:21.193
more than I can do.

12:21.194 --> 12:24.831
So somebody'll maybe say, "Oh,
I have a pilot," or something,

12:24.832 --> 12:25.925
or like a movie script.

12:25.926 --> 12:27.269
"Could you produce a movie script

12:27.270 --> 12:29.036
or see if, you know,
it could get made?"

12:29.037 --> 12:30.570
That's tacky.

12:30.571 --> 12:32.373
'Cause even then, sometimes
they'll take it a step further,

12:32.374 --> 12:33.998
and they'll be like,
"Oh, hey, you know,

12:33.999 --> 12:35.568
"we have this great thing for Melissa.

12:35.569 --> 12:38.547
- Uh, Ben, will you read it?"
- Shut... up!

12:39.947 --> 12:42.282
That's...

12:42.283 --> 12:44.484
so gross.

12:44.485 --> 12:45.619
- I mean, what...
- I don't know.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.123
Literally, what is wrong with people?

12:47.124 --> 12:48.956
- What is that?
- 'Cause I don't understand.

12:48.957 --> 12:52.125
Uh, this is...

12:52.126 --> 12:55.129
my... will.

12:55.130 --> 12:56.430
What? What are you talking...

12:56.431 --> 12:57.764
Are you... are you okay?

12:57.765 --> 12:59.365
I'm fine, and I don't... You know what?

12:59.366 --> 13:01.229
Now, I'm feeling sad and...
Well, let's just...

13:01.230 --> 13:03.570
Let's focus on the now
and live in the now.

13:03.571 --> 13:06.474
- (laughing)
- And here I am, and you are wondering,

13:06.475 --> 13:09.942
probably, why I said
that I want to come over

13:09.943 --> 13:12.079
and I made it sound
like it was super important.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.680
And it's really just because,

13:13.681 --> 13:15.983
you know, I need borrow $100,000.

13:15.984 --> 13:17.210
- I'm kidding.
- What?

13:17.211 --> 13:18.554
I'm just here because I miss you,

13:18.555 --> 13:20.019
and I haven't seen you in forever.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.181
And I feel like, you know,

13:21.182 --> 13:22.525
why don't you just start talking.

13:22.526 --> 13:24.324
- (mumbling)
- Okay.

13:24.325 --> 13:27.595
(inhales and gulps)

13:27.596 --> 13:28.561
Oh, Rach.

13:28.562 --> 13:31.566
(gulping continues)

13:33.034 --> 13:34.568
That was so good.

13:35.970 --> 13:37.773
That was really good.

13:40.066 --> 13:41.929
(Larry) So you didn't
talk to him about it all?

13:41.930 --> 13:43.310
- (Rachel) No, I...
- Hey, hey.

13:43.311 --> 13:45.345
- Hello!
- Hey, Rachel.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.047
Larry Dorf, what's the good word?

13:47.048 --> 13:48.212
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

13:48.213 --> 13:49.483
- Ooh, thank you.
- That is for you. Sorry, Pat.

13:49.484 --> 13:50.784
Never in my wildest dreams

13:50.785 --> 13:52.219
did I imagine that you'd be coming.

13:52.220 --> 13:53.787
Oh, I'll get my own drink.

13:53.788 --> 13:55.055
Okay.

13:55.056 --> 13:56.690
Now that I think about it,
uh, this bar,

13:56.691 --> 13:58.691
I have a problem with my
card 'cause of the strip

13:58.692 --> 14:01.094
and, like, the chip or
something with the machine.

14:01.095 --> 14:02.294
Do you guys have a tab?

14:02.295 --> 14:03.331
- No.
- Larry does.

14:03.332 --> 14:04.498
Open tab.

14:04.499 --> 14:06.166
Thank you, Rachel.

14:06.167 --> 14:07.567
How about we get something mellow?

14:07.568 --> 14:09.469
Something on the less expensive side.

14:09.470 --> 14:10.571
Great, thanks, Larry.

14:10.572 --> 14:13.172
Just like a domestic bottled beer.

14:13.173 --> 14:14.741
(whispers) Why did you
bring your roommate?

14:14.742 --> 14:16.768
I didn't bring him.
He's an adult, he's not a dog.

14:16.769 --> 14:18.001
Well, really quick before he gets back,

14:18.002 --> 14:19.012
Rachel chickened out.

14:19.013 --> 14:20.480
- What?
- She didn't pitch Ben.

14:20.481 --> 14:23.517
I did not chicken out.
It wasn't the right time.

14:23.518 --> 14:25.752
- What happened?
- I think it's a good thing.

14:25.753 --> 14:27.086
- I really do.
- Why?

14:27.087 --> 14:28.888
Because I think we need
to make this project

14:28.889 --> 14:31.457
more enticing before
we pitch it to Melissa.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.560
- Oh, my God.
- Now, my idea,

14:33.561 --> 14:36.430
if we can attach someone equally famous

14:36.431 --> 14:38.099
to play Mr. First Lady,

14:38.100 --> 14:39.600
then Melissa's gonna want to do it.

14:39.601 --> 14:41.768
- That's good!
- She'll be asking us to do it.

14:41.769 --> 14:43.570
- That's good.
- So what are we gonna do?

14:43.571 --> 14:45.471
Are we gonna drive around
town with a Star Map

14:45.472 --> 14:47.173
and start blowing people?

14:47.174 --> 14:49.502
Well, are we talking,
like, Kevin Costner or...

14:49.503 --> 14:51.086
I didn't think you'd say Kevin Costner.

14:51.087 --> 14:53.013
- God.
- What about Jason Bateman?

14:53.014 --> 14:55.114
Right? He was in
"Identify Thief" with Melissa.

14:55.115 --> 14:57.249
- Oh, yes.
- Like a known comedy duo.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.985
Oh, that's a great... yes!

14:58.986 --> 15:01.022
- People love them together.
- Yes, that's a fantastic idea.

15:01.023 --> 15:03.046
They were great. Did you
ever see "Identity Thief"?

15:03.047 --> 15:04.865
- They were fantastic.
- You did not see it.

15:04.866 --> 15:06.159
I didn't see it,

15:06.160 --> 15:07.943
but people said they loved it,
all over town.

15:07.944 --> 15:09.397
- Best movie of the year.
- Great.

15:09.398 --> 15:11.230
That's what they said, best.

15:11.231 --> 15:12.765
Great, so can you call him?

15:12.766 --> 15:14.567
- Why would I call him?
- Well, don't you have his number?

15:14.568 --> 15:15.936
Why would I have his number?

15:15.937 --> 15:17.640
Hugh, weren't you in
"Arrested Development?

15:17.641 --> 15:19.239
Yeah, that was a Justin Bateman show.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.874
I had one line

15:20.875 --> 15:23.409
and it was not to "Justin Bateman"

15:23.410 --> 15:25.311
whose name is Jason Bateman!

15:25.312 --> 15:26.975
- Well, that's the same thing.
- Too loud.

15:26.976 --> 15:28.348
What about Jason Bateman?

15:28.349 --> 15:29.682
Nothing. What is that?

15:29.683 --> 15:32.152
That's not a beer,
that's not a cheap... thing.

15:32.153 --> 15:34.086
- It's Kahlúa.
- Jesus.

15:34.087 --> 15:36.255
Does anyone we know know Jason Bateman?

15:36.256 --> 15:37.624
- No!
- Someone's got to.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.359
- I know Jason Bateman.
- How?

15:40.360 --> 15:43.297
I play pickup basketball
with him every Saturday.

15:43.298 --> 15:44.881
How is it you have
never mentioned that?

15:44.882 --> 15:47.619
I don't know, is it interesting?

15:51.766 --> 15:53.869
(Larry) What do we do, just
go up to him and ask him?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.676
Or do we wait until halftime?

15:55.677 --> 15:57.978
Larry, it's pickup basketball,
there's no halftime.

15:57.979 --> 15:59.079
Yes.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.465
Let's just feel it out, all right?

16:00.466 --> 16:01.889
Yeah. First, we need to impress him

16:01.890 --> 16:04.277
with our game, with our hustle.

16:04.278 --> 16:05.661
Hey, Larry, Larry, please, please.

16:05.662 --> 16:07.146
Let's just be normal, all right?

16:07.147 --> 16:08.850
(Larry) Eye on the prize.
Eye on the prize.

16:08.851 --> 16:10.957
Hey, Pat... Pat, we're,
uh, we're all ready.

16:10.958 --> 16:13.661
Hey, guys, this, uh, Larry and Hugh.

16:13.662 --> 16:14.829
- Hey, Larry.
- Larry.

16:14.830 --> 16:15.995
- Jason.
- Good to meet you.

16:15.996 --> 16:17.697
You already know Hugh, you guys

16:17.698 --> 16:19.801
worked on "Arrested Development"
together, Hugh said.

16:19.802 --> 16:20.933
- Geez, Pat.
- Oh, yeah?

16:20.934 --> 16:22.235
Uh, well, you know,

16:22.236 --> 16:24.504
it was all the... you...
the main people and then...

16:24.505 --> 16:25.805
Pleasure.

16:25.806 --> 16:27.874
Did we work together on the show?

16:27.875 --> 16:28.975
Was I in that scene?

16:28.976 --> 16:30.844
Uh... you were, but it was big group.

16:30.845 --> 16:34.440
And, uh, I was a policeman,
but I had to wear my own jeans.

16:34.441 --> 16:35.864
So I think they did... they just...

16:35.865 --> 16:36.950
I think I was in the back.

16:36.951 --> 16:38.618
There was a man kind of in front of me.

16:38.619 --> 16:40.019
Huh!

16:40.020 --> 16:42.203
- Well, great to see you again.
- Good to see you, too.

16:42.204 --> 16:43.657
Feed the beast.

16:43.658 --> 16:45.425
That's you? You're the beast?

16:45.426 --> 16:46.690
- That's right.
- There you go.

16:46.691 --> 16:48.194
- The best needs to roar.
- All right.

16:48.195 --> 16:49.495
One, two, three, shot!

16:49.496 --> 16:50.529
Quick release.

16:50.530 --> 16:51.565
Is that a pass or a shot?

16:51.566 --> 16:53.066
We're gonna shoot for teams.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.850
Whoever makes it...
first three to make it...

16:54.851 --> 16:55.850
- Here we go.
- Then we'll know who we got.

16:55.851 --> 16:56.836
- No!
- Well...

16:56.837 --> 16:59.299
Let me explain the concept.
We're just gonna...

16:59.300 --> 17:00.643
First three guys to make a basket

17:00.644 --> 17:02.509
are on the same team.

17:02.510 --> 17:04.579
- You got great energy.
- (chuckling)

17:06.413 --> 17:09.682
There we go. Oh, so warm already.

17:09.683 --> 17:11.469
- I can feel your humidity.
- You are great.

17:11.470 --> 17:12.903
You were great in "Identity Thief."

17:12.904 --> 17:13.686
(groans)

17:13.688 --> 17:15.189
I saw it, I saw it.

17:15.190 --> 17:16.489
There it is, that's one, guys.

17:16.490 --> 17:18.223
I saw "Identity Thief" like five times.

17:18.223 --> 17:20.928
- Oh, yeah?
- I saw it, it's an awesome movie.

17:20.929 --> 17:23.396
Thank you, I thought it was kind
of under-appreciated, right?

17:23.396 --> 17:24.980
Hey, Larry, switch.
Why don't we switch?

17:24.981 --> 17:26.066
No, I got him, I got him!

17:26.067 --> 17:28.067
We're on offense, Larry.

17:28.068 --> 17:29.335
Larry, we're on offense!

17:29.336 --> 17:30.470
I'm actually guarding you right now.

17:30.471 --> 17:31.897
All right, just give it to me then.

17:31.898 --> 17:33.441
Hugh and I have this idea for a movie.

17:33.442 --> 17:35.608
- What's that?
- It's called Mr. First Lady.

17:35.609 --> 17:37.210
It's awesome, it's written for you.

17:37.211 --> 17:38.545
- A male first lady?
- Yeah.

17:38.546 --> 17:39.547
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:39.548 --> 17:40.940
Good shot.

17:40.941 --> 17:42.484
Are you pitching me a movie right now?

17:42.485 --> 17:43.349
Huh? Yeah.

17:43.350 --> 17:44.351
Why don't we wait for a time out?

17:44.352 --> 17:45.585
No, it's written for you.

17:45.586 --> 17:46.931
It's great, it's perfect for you.

17:46.932 --> 17:48.467
Love to hear about it after the game.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.891
♪♪

17:50.892 --> 17:53.126
Let me explain the concept of
basketball to you real quick.

17:53.127 --> 17:54.928
- Hey, Lar! Lar!
- You're looking for the ball,

17:54.929 --> 17:56.512
and you wanna put the ball in the hole.

17:56.513 --> 17:57.776
- Yeah.
- That gets you a point.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.597
Most points wins.

17:58.598 --> 17:59.932
Why don't we switch, Lar?

17:59.933 --> 18:02.201
There's an offensive
component to the game, okay?

18:02.202 --> 18:04.104
(Hugh) Larry, Larry,
why don't we switch?

18:04.105 --> 18:05.704
He's a piece of work.

18:05.705 --> 18:06.873
Oh, God, you're so sweaty.

18:06.874 --> 18:08.275
Oh, my God, Larry, stop that!

18:08.276 --> 18:09.899
- Let's switch, let's switch...
- No, no.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.034
I'm gonna wake up pregnant
in the morning,

18:11.035 --> 18:12.645
it's gonna be your pal's problem.

18:12.646 --> 18:14.114
Come on, Larry, cut it out!

18:14.115 --> 18:16.682
You son of a bitch. Larry, stay back!

18:16.683 --> 18:17.918
He's a regular guy!

18:17.919 --> 18:19.752
No! He's not a regular guy!

18:19.753 --> 18:21.216
- That's why we're here!
- Good shot.

18:21.217 --> 18:22.957
Here we go, balls out.

18:22.958 --> 18:24.192
Yeah.

18:25.961 --> 18:28.028
Not in my house!

18:28.029 --> 18:29.628
Ow! Oh, God!

18:29.629 --> 18:31.431
- (groaning)
- What? What?

18:31.432 --> 18:33.133
- Oh, God! Hoo!
- Larry!

18:33.134 --> 18:35.269
- Are you all right?
- Oh, my God, are you all right?

18:35.270 --> 18:37.013
(Jason) Completely gave
out, did you see it?

18:37.014 --> 18:39.439
Oh, God damn it, Larry!
God damn it, God damn it!

18:39.440 --> 18:41.511
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

18:42.676 --> 18:43.844
It's not my fault.

18:43.845 --> 18:45.145
I didn't say it was your fault.

18:45.146 --> 18:46.569
Well, it's sort of your fault, I mean,

18:46.570 --> 18:48.200
you're the one that said we'd
have Melissa for the meeting.

18:48.201 --> 18:49.883
And here we are, and we don't
have Melissa for the meeting.

18:49.884 --> 18:51.384
My God, quit gang banging me.

18:51.385 --> 18:53.552
Will you learn what that
term means, or don't use it.

18:53.553 --> 18:54.621
Oh, hey, guys.

18:54.622 --> 18:55.621
- Gavin!
- Oh, Gavin.

18:55.622 --> 18:56.722
- Darling.
- Hey.

18:56.723 --> 18:57.856
Hey... What?

18:57.857 --> 18:59.592
Um, look, I am so, so sorry.

18:59.593 --> 19:02.695
But I have to... I have to
reschedule our meeting, okay?

19:02.696 --> 19:03.829
What?!

19:03.830 --> 19:06.099
- Ohh... no...
- Okay, all right. Great.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.443
We're in a little bit of a crisis

19:07.444 --> 19:08.627
over here at the moment.

19:08.628 --> 19:10.451
We were about to start
shooting this new movie

19:10.452 --> 19:11.652
with Jason Bateman,

19:11.653 --> 19:13.516
and we just found out
that he's in the hospital

19:13.517 --> 19:15.189
having knee surgery, so...

19:15.190 --> 19:17.792
We are sort of
scrambling over here, um...

19:17.793 --> 19:19.427
Knee surgery, really? From that?

19:19.428 --> 19:21.011
That's gotta be
a preexisting condition.

19:21.012 --> 19:22.430
Larry. That is terrible.

19:22.431 --> 19:24.198
You know, we'll reschedule and, uh...

19:24.199 --> 19:25.534
Hey, is Melissa here?

19:25.535 --> 19:26.834
Oh...

19:26.835 --> 19:28.202
Melissa is here.

19:28.203 --> 19:31.771
Um, but she is going to
the bathroom right now.

19:31.772 --> 19:34.042
- She's peeing.
- Yeah, she's not going...

19:34.043 --> 19:35.059
There's nothing wrong
with her stomach...

19:35.060 --> 19:35.642
It's just pee-pee.

19:35.643 --> 19:37.344
She's just using the restroom.

19:37.345 --> 19:38.947
She doesn't have diarrhea or...

19:38.948 --> 19:40.515
We don't know what she's doing,
she's using the bathroom.

19:40.516 --> 19:42.499
- Yeah, it's normal.
- Everyone uses the bathroom.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.151
- Sure.
- Stars are like us.

19:44.152 --> 19:45.585
That's great, guys.

19:45.586 --> 19:47.729
Um, I'm just gonna stay here
and wait for her, though.

19:47.730 --> 19:48.922
I got to make a few calls.

19:48.923 --> 19:50.746
But, you know, when she
gets out, I'll say hi.

19:50.747 --> 19:52.059
Oh, uh...

19:52.060 --> 19:54.594
Yeah, uh... you wait and...

19:54.595 --> 19:56.597
- But...
- ...we're gonna take off.

19:56.598 --> 19:58.600
I'll be in touch, all right?
I got to make a call.

19:58.601 --> 20:00.200
- Thank you so much, Gavin.
- Thank you.

20:00.201 --> 20:02.903
- That's so...
- That's crazy.

20:02.904 --> 20:05.640
That's amazing. I guess it's
official, no Justin Bateman.

20:05.641 --> 20:08.942
Uh, <i>Jason,</i> and it was official
long before this moment.

20:08.943 --> 20:10.245

Now we have more time to get Melissa.

God, he's gonna get off the phone soon.

20:17.152 --> 20:18.553
Can we just take the stairs?

20:18.554 --> 20:20.455
I don't know where
the God damn stairs are.

20:20.456 --> 20:22.036

20:23.758 --> 20:25.693

20:25.694 --> 20:27.027
Get... go!

20:27.028 --> 20:28.597
Yeah, so what did he say?

20:29.364 --> 20:30.666
Jason, who else?

20:31.767 --> 20:33.350
Well, I don't know,
I mean, it's been...

20:33.351 --> 20:36.036
It's tough you know, what are
we supposed to do about it?

20:36.037 --> 20:37.838
- Larry. Get down here.
- What?

20:37.839 --> 20:39.039
What are we doing out there?

20:39.040 --> 20:40.701
- Don't yell at me, I'm gonna go up...
- How is he feeling?

20:40.702 --> 20:42.617
- I wanna go up and around.
- No, he should get the surgery

20:42.618 --> 20:44.201
- We'll talk about it afterwards.
- Shh!

20:44.202 --> 20:46.742
We'll figure something out, I
mean, maybe we can shoot some...

20:47.216 --> 20:49.618
- God damn it.
- Careful.

20:50.848 --> 20:52.650

Wait!
