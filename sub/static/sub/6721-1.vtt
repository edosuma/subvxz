02:55.384 --> 02:58.263
What I have for you
is a groundbreaking product

02:58.345 --> 03:01.645
that Kmart has the opportunity
to have on its shelves

03:01.807 --> 03:04.936
before anyone else
has it on their shelves.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.439
First, some background
information on me.

03:08.980 --> 03:12.484
I have a Master's Degree
in chemistry from UCLA.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.320
For the last three years,

03:14.444 --> 03:17.118
I worked at the
Environmental Protection Agency.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.448
And trust me,

03:18.532 --> 03:20.500
I didn't stay three years
because of the ladies.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.504
I stayed because I was fascinated
by the work I was doing there!

03:27.749 --> 03:31.049
Primarily that was
the sustainable technology

03:31.128 --> 03:32.596
sourced by renewable resources.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.722
I know what you're thinking...

03:35.257 --> 03:37.851
"Boring Chemistry Alert!" Right?

03:38.343 --> 03:39.515
Wrong!

03:40.178 --> 03:43.523
One day, I had a breakthrough.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.352
I created a micro-emulsion suspension

03:46.601 --> 03:50.401
that harnessed
the natural cleaning power of

03:52.399 --> 03:53.742
coconut oil,

03:55.318 --> 03:57.662
palm kernel oil,

03:57.988 --> 03:59.160
and

03:59.823 --> 04:00.824
soy!

04:03.326 --> 04:05.328
Not soy sauce,

04:05.996 --> 04:07.543
but soybean oil.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.417
And this comes together to
create what I like to call...

04:13.420 --> 04:15.798
Can you see that?
I thought the table would be smaller.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.007
Can you see it?

04:17.841 --> 04:21.345
Scieoclean! Scieo-clean!

04:21.678 --> 04:25.353
Science and clean in one word.

04:25.849 --> 04:29.194
Okay. Very thorough.
Thanks for coming in.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.271
And we'll be in touch, down the road.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.273
I have full FDA approval,

04:33.356 --> 04:34.528
and I have enough financial backing...

04:34.608 --> 04:38.533
Actually, we're already in
talks with major companies...

04:38.695 --> 04:40.789
Yeah. Whose products
are toxic and harmful.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.162
...as well as
established organic companies.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.602
But develop some brand recognition

04:44.618 --> 04:47.292
and maybe, in a year or two,
we'll revisit.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.336
- He lived in Manhattan, too.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.756
And so we came back and
we started seeing each other.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.091
He didn't want anything serious,
but I was just caught up with this...

13:57.337 --> 13:59.431
- Oh, the passion of it all!
- Oh.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.098

- I won't gross you out.
- Yeah. That's cool.

serious, really, at the time.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.236

20:11.293 --> 20:13.512

I'm hearing this correctly.

in a car with your mother.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.188

if you don't want to do it, then fine.

how did you turn this around?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.755
I just invited you to... I'm inviting you!

20:51.834 --> 20:54.212
Do you want to drive
across the country with me?

20:54.336 --> 20:55.679
Well, I might have to reroute my mail.

Okay!

- Great.
- Do you really need an SUV?

22:11.330 --> 22:12.957
The gas'll cost more than the car.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.709
So that comes out to $112 a day.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.802
Wait, wait, wait! I got a coupon.

22:17.044 --> 22:20.639
Good. Yeah. That works.
It takes 15% off, so...

22:21.465 --> 22:25.720
It brings your new total to $940.
Excuse me one second.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.893
- Way to go! Yeah.
- That was very exciting.

- I was going to ask.
- Really.

- Yes!
- I thought you forgot.

You thought in the two seconds
since you reminded me...

22:33.477 --> 22:37.152
Anyway! Anyway, nowadays
small cars are fine in the snow.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.900
They probably have that GPS thing.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.327
They don't. Okay?
Only big cars have GPS.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.913
Actually, our GPS systems
are separate.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.740
You can rent them with any car.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.914
And our economy cars
handle quite well in the snow.

Well, I got three meetings today,

24:06.487 --> 24:07.830
and then I got a few in Virginia,

24:07.905 --> 24:09.498
and the last one is in Roanoke.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.083
Roanoke! Whoo!

24:11.408 --> 24:13.752
Then Texas is next. Costco. That's...

24:14.078 --> 24:16.922
That's a big one,
so if we want to get there in time,

24:16.997 --> 24:18.437
we gotta be in Tennessee by Tuesday.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.169
You know who lives
in Tennessee, right?

24:21.418 --> 24:22.510
Yes, I do. So after that...

24:22.753 --> 24:24.096

her mother recently.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.092

I'm sure it is. So...

I spoke to Anita this morning.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.146

24:33.222 --> 24:35.441
to get some closure
with that relationship.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.936
So if we have time,
we should meet up with her.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.608
From Texas, we head to Santa Fe,

24:40.688 --> 24:42.861

then Vegas.

to ever tell me that.

on your skin or in your eyes

That's good. You know
what I should do is actually

31:50.659 --> 31:52.502

in front of them.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.669

of hard to change the name

- The color of my penis...
- It's not purple.

38:04.491 --> 38:05.492
It's pink. Hi!

38:06.367 --> 38:08.165
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.792
The roads are pretty awful.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.045
Could take the tow truck quite a while.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.298
Our girl Moonlight's
pretty good with cars.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.049
You want me to ask her to take a look?

38:17.378 --> 38:18.550
Who's Moonlight?

38:19.047 --> 38:20.890
Oh, my gosh, this is
the cutest little thing.

38:21.341 --> 38:23.890
That's very nice of you, Moonlight.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.845
I just wish you were wearing
something warmer.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.398
Oh, that's sweet of you, but I'm fine.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.275
- Put your hood up, honey.
- No. I don't want to.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.525
Oh. Here it is.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.528
You got ice frozen up around the tire.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.531
It's blocking the wheel and making it
feel like you got a flat.

38:40.652 --> 38:41.653
- My God!
- You sure about that?

38:41.736 --> 38:42.737
You sure it's not flat?

38:43.029 --> 38:44.372
I'm positive.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.875
Wow! She really is a mechanic!

38:48.076 --> 38:49.578
She really knows what she's doing.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.420
My God, you weren't kidding.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.922
Thank you very much.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.007
Those heels come in handy.
I'm very impressed.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.841
May I interest you in a private dance?

38:58.920 --> 39:00.843
Oh! I'd love... Thank you,

39:00.922 --> 39:03.846

when my mom's not here.

- Oh, thank you, Miss Joyce.

They're saying you shouldn't
get on the highway right now.

39:13.393 --> 39:14.440
Are you staying local?

39:14.727 --> 39:16.727
Yeah, we'll just get
a hotel or something, I guess.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.236
Well, actually,
we don't have to because...

39:19.566 --> 39:21.113
It's gonna be tough finding
a room anywhere in this.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.201
I bet.

39:22.277 --> 39:23.620
You got anywhere you can crash?

39:23.695 --> 39:25.948

- No. We do not.

- We do know somebody.
- We don't.

She came up several times
in conversation.

<font color="#808080">ANDY:</font> - Very casually.

Andy proposed to me

It was silly. It was a silly thing to do.

when you relabel the bottle...

"When" is a little preemptive.

to the "when" conclusion.

- When you do, I would change

said I should come over
and give you a hand.

of the pieces you cut off,

- you gotta keep them small.
- Mmm-hmm.

It's called the cycle.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.454
You got to learn the cycle,
which is two small pieces,

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:34.632

two small pieces of steak,

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.091
- potato, salad.
- About that size?

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:37.767
Yeah. That's perfect, actually.

01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:39.516

- Two of those.

- Yeah.

- Is that good?

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:53.567

run out of things to pierce

to San Francisco alone,

the rest of the weekend here.

And he's not married.

Scieoclean, Andrew.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.044

- It is.

Scieoclean, as I call it,

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:51.719
is an exciting new cleaning product

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:55.138
that harnesses the natural
foaming and cleaning power

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.969
of three completely
renewable resources.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:58.812
- Interesting.
- They are...

- A coconut!

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.730
That's a coconut. Let's see.

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:09.907
That's hard.
That's a hard nut to crack, isn't it?

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:29.093
As I previously stated,
a neutral pH reading

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.568
is somewhere between six and eight.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.595
Now, if you recall,
Scieoclean came in at seven,

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:35.765
which was perfect.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:39.432
Now, my competitor's pH reading
is nine point...

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:40.604
Can you see it?

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:45.352
Is it in the... I don't know
if you're zooming in on...

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:49.189
But it says nine point six, which is high,

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.782
and it, uh...

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.292
I lost you guys. Uh...

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.996
I totally lost you guys.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.169
That lady's sending an email.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.167
I've completely lost you,

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:11.469
and I think I know why I lost you guys.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:15.640
It's 'cause this sucks! And it's boring.

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:19.640
And it's full of a bunch of science-y stuff
that no one really cares about.

01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:22.688
So, why don't I try this?

Yes, I do. I have a dog and a little girl.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.061
Okay. What are their names?

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:34.404
Mr. Pickles and Gabriella.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.917
So let me ask you,

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.393
you probably go through great pains

01:17:45.452 --> 01:17:47.375
to prevent Mr. Pickles
and Gabriella from dying,

01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:49.331
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Well, yes, I would.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:51.383
Is this what you normally
clean your house with?

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:53.538
It's whatever's on sale.
It's usually blue or yellow.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:54.761
That would be correct, yes.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:56.472
Well, here's the problem with that.

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:58.675
It's extremely poisonous.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.807
And it's really dangerous.
I can show you statistics

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:04.021
and experiments
that prove that my product

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.440
doesn't only clean better
than those, but it's safer.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.943
But if I've shown you one thing,
it's that that is really boring.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.192
So instead, I'll just do this.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.700
I'll step back for the experiment.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.039
Oh, my God.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.207

Scieoclean is the best cleaning product
that's ever been invented.

It's completely natural,
it's completely safe,

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.885

any product on the market.

If any of my competitors
are making the same claim,

all I say is, come on TV

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:46.063
and drink your product.
But I don't think you will

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:48.899

shit blood on TV.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:45.193
Since I was your mother and your father,

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:46.482
and I had to tell you about sex.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:47.562
Yes.

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:48.737
Did that help you in your life?

01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:50.736
Well, you can't undo
the fact that you told me

01:32:50.815 --> 01:32:53.034
about penetrative sex at a young age.

01:32:53.151 --> 01:32:55.370
But I guess... I don't know.

01:32:55.487 --> 01:32:56.830
Just don't do that in the future.

01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:58.230
Well, I'll give you my number.

01:32:58.281 --> 01:32:59.248
Okay.

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:00.621
And you give us a call
when you're in town.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:02.247
Yeah, you guys should
probably keep in touch.

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.328
All right.

01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:07.298
Like, as a rule?
They just rape all the time?

01:33:07.373 --> 01:33:10.718
No, not all the time.
Sometimes. But you never know.

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:12.837
They may not rape you, but...

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:16.015
- They'll rape someone.
- They're gonna rape someone.

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:21.138
- They might rape both of us.
- Oh, no!

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:23.565
I carry the Books on Tape
in a Walkman.

01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:25.816
- In a what?
- A Walkman.

01:33:25.892 --> 01:33:27.610
In a Walkman?

01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:29.926
Do you have to get in
a time machine before you use that?

01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:31.940
You should call Cousin Lowell.

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:33.525
I should call Cousin Lowell?

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:35.326
Have I ever met Cousin Lowell?

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:37.119
It doesn't matter. He has T.B.

01:33:37.195 --> 01:33:38.242
it would be very nice to hear from you.

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:41.082
- He has tuberculosis?
- It's around now.

01:33:41.199 --> 01:33:43.159
- Do people still get that?
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.

01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:44.953
I thought they stopped getting that,
like, in cowboy times?

01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:46.357
Didn't you hear that story... No.

01:33:46.371 --> 01:33:48.749
Didn't you hear that story
about the guy on the plane?

01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:51.547
- He had tuberculosis?
- And he infected the people.

01:33:51.876 --> 01:33:53.549
Was Lowell on that plane?

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:54.712
I think so.

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:56.319
<font color="#808080">AUTOMATED VOICE:</font> <i>Exit in 1,000 feet.</i>

01:33:56.381 --> 01:33:57.473
Come on! Exit!
A thousand feet! Just exit!

01:33:57.549 --> 01:33:58.675
How far is 1,000 feet?

01:33:58.758 --> 01:33:59.850
You got to merge, Ma! That way!

01:33:59.926 --> 01:34:01.269
Into what, honey? Into what?

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:02.558
Into the exit!

01:34:02.762 --> 01:34:06.016
I'm driving 65 miles an hour
and she's talking in feet.

01:34:06.099 --> 01:34:08.227
- Who the hell is that?
- Holy shit, there's a woman!
