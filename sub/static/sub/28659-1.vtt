03:16.628 --> 03:19.028
Welcome to our town.
Podunk, Missouri.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.730
It's not actually called Podunk.

03:20.732 --> 03:23.032
But this is the place they were thinking of
when they came up with the name "Podunk".

03:23.034 --> 03:26.803
It's 60 miles of forest between
here and the next shithole over.

03:26.805 --> 03:29.705
The kind of town where people don't
even lock their doors at night.

03:29.707 --> 03:32.408
Yeah, we're officially
too boring for crime.

03:32.410 --> 03:34.077
What's up? I'm Randy Foster.

03:34.079 --> 03:35.112
And I'm Zach Henderson.

03:35.114 --> 03:36.747
[Zach] So this is what
we're going to be doing.

03:36.749 --> 03:41.585
We're going to be flying under the radar
with these sweet little Bluetooth cameras

03:41.587 --> 03:43.754

low light lenses.

03:43.756 --> 03:46.590
And you can buy these from affiliate

03:46.592 --> 03:48.158
'cause we need cash
to get out of here.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.294
- Yeah.
- But back to business.

03:49.296 --> 03:53.564
So we edit everything here
on Zach's sweet rig. Up top.

03:53.566 --> 03:57.869
And then we add some of my bangin' FX
and boom, it's on the wild, wild web.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.974
So we can show you the
real "Multon: Uncovered."

04:04.778 --> 04:07.045
[Zach whispering] That is the captain
of the high school football team.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.179

Uh, you can wake up, eat, go to sleep.
It's pretty exciting.

04:22.063 --> 04:22.930
[Zach] So yeah.

04:23.865 --> 04:25.030
This is Multon.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.631
All 2.5 blocks of it.

And this is our cast

04:30.570 --> 04:32.071
- Hey, Pastor Greg.
- Hey.

04:32.073 --> 04:35.040
We're doing a production of "Jesus
Christ Superstar" down at the church.

No.

I bet you're wondering why are they
showing us this squat, boring ass building?

04:59.067 --> 05:02.836
Well, that's because this building is the
best thing that ever happened to Multon.

05:02.838 --> 05:05.772
High speed internet so we're not totally
cut off from the rest of the planet.

05:05.774 --> 05:09.243

See this is the point
of our show:

06:00.764 --> 06:04.101
to show the people of Multon
the way they really are.

Yeah, but I love Mexican food.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.626
Plus, we could be called
the Dos Amigos.

12:23.628 --> 12:25.297
[chuckles]

12:26.665 --> 12:30.367
Ah, I can't leave my mom to take
care of my dad by herself.

12:30.369 --> 12:32.702
Dude, I love your parents.

12:32.704 --> 12:33.670
They're awesome.

12:33.672 --> 12:36.674
But you got to start
living your life, man.

12:36.676 --> 12:38.243
- Plus...
- [girl screaming]

12:41.213 --> 12:43.081
- What the hell is that?
- [girl screaming]

12:55.995 --> 12:57.597
- [knocking on door]
- Mrs. Bisette?

13:04.070 --> 13:05.171
[Randy] Mrs. Bisette?

13:14.247 --> 13:16.650
Hello? Mrs. Bisette?

13:22.423 --> 13:24.191
[electricity sounds]

13:28.362 --> 13:29.997
Holy Jesus.

13:31.565 --> 13:32.700
Call the cops.

13:37.171 --> 13:39.539
<i>Sheriff's office.</i>

13:39.541 --> 13:41.541
Hi, we're at Mrs.
Bisette's house.

13:41.543 --> 13:42.943
Something's wrong.

13:45.012 --> 13:46.112
[phone clicks off]

13:46.114 --> 13:46.980
Hello?

13:50.385 --> 13:51.584
They hung up.

13:51.586 --> 13:52.452
Really?

13:52.454 --> 13:54.322
[loud bang]

13:55.323 --> 13:56.558
[squeaking chandelier]

13:59.093 --> 14:00.629
[quick taps moving]

14:19.048 --> 14:20.047
Come on, Randy.

14:20.049 --> 14:21.217
Oh, shit.

14:23.486 --> 14:24.487
- Randy?
- What?

14:26.288 --> 14:27.389
Let's go.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.039
[faint crying]

15:11.369 --> 15:12.101
Hey, hey.

15:12.103 --> 15:13.771
It's-it's-it's okay,
it's okay.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.174
What happened?

15:18.342 --> 15:19.542
Something bit me.

15:19.544 --> 15:20.710
Something bit me.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.278
Something bit me.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.813
[crying] Something bit me.

15:23.815 --> 15:25.484
[noises]

15:38.697 --> 15:40.564
[girl screaming]

15:40.566 --> 15:42.067
Are you going to be okay?

15:45.170 --> 15:46.171
Come on.

15:46.906 --> 15:48.440
Shit!

15:52.545 --> 15:53.578
Whoa, what are you doing?

15:53.580 --> 15:54.478
We have to find it.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.546
What? Why?

15:55.548 --> 15:56.681
It might have rabies.

15:56.683 --> 15:57.650
[noises]

16:06.593 --> 16:07.926
[Zach] Come on!

16:07.928 --> 16:09.162
[Randy] Dude, where'd it go?

16:10.697 --> 16:12.831
[Zach] Right there!
Get it! Get it!

16:12.833 --> 16:14.267
[Randy] I'm trying. I'm trying.

16:16.637 --> 16:17.437
Get down.

16:25.346 --> 16:26.578
What the hell is it?

16:26.580 --> 16:28.148
That's, I think it's a rat.

16:44.599 --> 16:46.468
Pastor Greg?

16:52.707 --> 16:55.210
But why do you have
to go away so much?

17:01.549 --> 17:04.486
But I'm just so tired
of being left alone.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.491
I miss you so much.

17:30.413 --> 17:32.013
- Hey, assholes!
- Shit!

17:32.015 --> 17:33.014
Leave them alone.

17:33.016 --> 17:34.415
Shut your mouth.

17:34.417 --> 17:35.784
All I was doing was
buying some beer.

17:35.786 --> 17:36.951
You had to put it online.

17:36.953 --> 17:38.720
Listen, we got something to
do so we're just gonna go.

17:38.722 --> 17:40.722
I don't care!
My dad took my Xbox!

17:40.724 --> 17:41.990
- I don't care about your Xbox!
- Shut up!

17:41.992 --> 17:43.958
All right, all right,
let's calm down.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.562
- Shall we?
- What the hell?

17:48.265 --> 17:50.298
I was just playing with them.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.868
Remember what it was like
back on the team, Josh?

17:53.004 --> 17:57.505
Well, back on the team I
remember we could take a joke.

17:57.507 --> 17:59.008
- Let's go.
- [Josh] Go on.

17:59.010 --> 18:00.843
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

18:00.845 --> 18:01.813
Sure.

18:04.916 --> 18:06.281
[Zach] Thanks.

18:06.283 --> 18:11.787
Well, you might have funny
videos, but nobody likes a snitch.

18:11.789 --> 18:14.592
Listen, we have something
we need to show you.

18:20.331 --> 18:21.265
[Zach] <i>What was that?</i>

18:22.867 --> 18:23.869
<i>Are you gonna be okay?</i>

18:27.072 --> 18:28.506
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

18:30.809 --> 18:34.811
I'm sorry, I don't even know
what this is. What is this?

18:34.813 --> 18:36.446
It bit Mrs. Bisette.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.750
Okay, then why didn't she
come to us herself?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.485
Hmm?

18:41.487 --> 18:41.987
What?

18:43.555 --> 18:46.923
Come on, Pastor Greg is going around
throwing rats in people's houses. Done.

18:46.925 --> 18:49.359
Mmm. Okay.

18:49.361 --> 18:50.895
You know what?

18:50.897 --> 18:54.333
Leave me out of your
bullshit web series. All right?

18:55.969 --> 18:59.503
If you guys want to become
Hollywood assholes,

18:59.505 --> 19:02.509
Photo shopping this
nonsense, whatever.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.443
But leave me out of it.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.946
And for that matter, leave
Pastor Greg out of it as well.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.882
He's a good man.

19:10.884 --> 19:13.319
I'd ended up in juvie
if it weren't for him.

19:15.855 --> 19:16.623
Got it?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.026
Yeah. Got it.

19:21.028 --> 19:23.561
- [Zach] How could Josh not believe us?
- [Randy] Because it's insane.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.031
We're saying that Pastor Greg is
throwing rats into people's houses.

19:26.033 --> 19:28.567
Yeah, but the video is crazy.

19:28.569 --> 19:30.037
I mean why would
Pastor Greg do it?

19:33.574 --> 19:35.042
I don't know. Let's ask.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.632
[eerie noise]

19:59.634 --> 20:00.669
What the hell is that?

20:07.143 --> 20:07.943
Come on.

20:11.713 --> 20:12.849
[religious music]

20:13.883 --> 20:14.984
[door slams closing]

21:22.053 --> 21:24.155
[clanking noise]

21:30.129 --> 21:31.030
Pastor Greg?

22:00.226 --> 22:01.694
Can I help you boys?

22:15.008 --> 22:15.842
So?

22:17.278 --> 22:18.643
[clanking noise]

22:18.645 --> 22:19.512
That's you.

22:21.148 --> 22:22.249
I don't think so.

22:24.784 --> 22:26.185
No, we saw you.

22:26.187 --> 22:30.655
Look Pastor Greg, we do not want
to get you into any trouble here.

22:30.657 --> 22:32.994
You boys aren't going
to get me in any trouble.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.164
Your mom is a slut.

22:38.699 --> 22:40.067
And your dad is a junkie.

22:41.769 --> 22:44.069
Jesus Christ, what kind
of person says that?

22:44.071 --> 22:46.272
No need to raise your voice.

22:46.274 --> 22:47.808
Is there a problem here?

22:53.315 --> 22:54.782
No, we're cool.

23:00.722 --> 23:02.290
[door squeaks open]
Dude, what the hell was that?

23:03.291 --> 23:04.492
I don't know.

23:04.494 --> 23:06.760
[Zach] I think we should post
this stuff on our channel.

23:06.762 --> 23:09.131
I mean Josh didn't believe us,
but maybe somebody will.

23:11.199 --> 23:12.366
Oh, shit.

23:12.368 --> 23:13.935
No service. You?

23:15.771 --> 23:16.671
Nothing.

23:24.947 --> 23:32.221
So we were wondering if you had seen
Pastor Greg around your house last night?

23:34.991 --> 23:35.992
Why?

23:37.593 --> 23:41.028
Okay, we think that he's the one who
threw the thing at the house that bit you.

23:41.030 --> 23:41.798
Yeah.

23:43.666 --> 23:45.002
Oh, I wasn't bit.

23:55.279 --> 23:56.980
Do you see a bite?

23:59.750 --> 24:02.784
I'm sorry, I-I could have sworn that
you were sitting in your closet.

24:02.786 --> 24:05.220
No. No, we have a video.
We saw you screaming.

24:05.222 --> 24:06.257
So?

24:09.360 --> 24:10.794
Uh, uh...

24:11.929 --> 24:13.298
[loud noises]

24:22.006 --> 24:23.706
What-what was that?

24:23.708 --> 24:25.210
[loud noises]

24:26.311 --> 24:28.346
You can come to my
bedroom with me.

24:32.451 --> 24:34.018
Both of you.

24:40.825 --> 24:42.292
- Holy shit.
- Dude.

24:42.294 --> 24:43.327
What the hell was that?

24:43.329 --> 24:46.063
Wait. Hold on. Something
was going on in there.

24:46.065 --> 24:47.099
Yeah, no shit.

24:48.901 --> 24:50.367
First Pastor Greg, now her.

24:50.369 --> 24:52.870
Here's what I don't get.
Who heals that fast?

24:52.872 --> 24:53.939
Randy, look.

24:55.442 --> 24:57.743
- What are we doing?
- We're just looking around.

25:02.349 --> 25:03.981
- What's that?
- There's a guy in there.

25:03.983 --> 25:05.216
What?

25:05.218 --> 25:06.086
Shh!

25:07.287 --> 25:09.356
He's tied up to the bed.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.805
[gasps]

25:27.807 --> 25:29.143
Oh! Go!

25:39.053 --> 25:40.888
- [gasps]
- <i>Oh! Go!</i>

25:45.927 --> 25:48.928
You two should not have
been looking in her window.

25:48.930 --> 25:50.465
This is none of our concern.

25:52.401 --> 25:55.067
That's not the point, okay?
She's being weird, Mom. Look at that.

25:55.069 --> 25:57.836
It, but it wasn't just her.
It's Pastor Greg was acting like a freak.

25:57.838 --> 26:00.440
Everyone in the church was just like
sitting there acting really weird.

26:00.442 --> 26:04.110
Maybe it's like mass hysteria or
something, something in the air.

26:04.112 --> 26:11.084
[dad] Look, I know this town is boring
and I know you can't wait to get out.

26:11.086 --> 26:12.419
It's not about that.

26:12.421 --> 26:16.056
[dad] But you're not gonna make
anything better by imaging things.

26:16.058 --> 26:18.328
It just is what it is.

26:24.434 --> 26:27.003
Look, either the entire
town's going crazy or we are.

26:30.073 --> 26:31.040
[sighs]

26:33.843 --> 26:34.978
[Randy] Look.

26:36.846 --> 26:37.878
Is that...?

26:37.880 --> 26:38.514
Dylan.

26:40.316 --> 26:41.351
That's his tat.

26:46.055 --> 26:47.524
But how are there two of him?

27:05.542 --> 27:06.844
It's my dad.

27:11.483 --> 27:13.882
He's been acting
really strange.

27:13.884 --> 27:15.052
I don't know, it's...

27:18.223 --> 27:21.557
He was fine a few days ago,

27:21.559 --> 27:24.362
but now it's like, it's like
there's no feeling in him.

27:25.964 --> 27:28.833
It's-it's like he's-he's
acting like my dad.

27:32.337 --> 27:36.575
Look, I know that this sounds crazy,
but it's like he's a different person.

27:38.511 --> 27:45.549
You know, he has the same face,
and-and-and-and the same voice, but he's...

27:45.551 --> 27:47.219
He's not the same inside.

27:54.193 --> 27:55.492
Am I losing my mind?

27:55.494 --> 27:57.094
- No.
- No.

27:57.096 --> 27:58.896
We've seen the same
thing all over town.

27:58.898 --> 28:00.097
Yeah.

28:00.099 --> 28:02.134
[Zach] There's a bunch of people
that are acting different.

28:04.036 --> 28:05.336
How about your mom?

28:05.338 --> 28:09.443
I don't know. I mean I haven't
seen her since this morning.

28:14.614 --> 28:16.216
We need to go to the police.

28:17.684 --> 28:20.318
We talked to Josh.
He didn't seem too amused by it.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.553
Why?

28:21.555 --> 28:24.391
Our credibility ain't so hot
after we posted our web show.

28:25.392 --> 28:27.258
Nobody believes us.

28:27.260 --> 28:30.931
Okay, well will you
guys come with me?

28:32.667 --> 28:38.637
To help me find my mom and to get
Joey and-and you can record it,

28:38.639 --> 28:42.341
you know, with your cameras and then
we can get people to believe us.

28:42.343 --> 28:43.542
Yeah. Yeah.

28:43.544 --> 28:44.977
Yeah, that's a really good idea.

28:44.979 --> 28:47.348
[Zach] All right, stand up.
We're going to put this camera on you.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.168
[Kayla] Evening.

29:40.170 --> 29:41.070
Hi.

29:42.105 --> 29:43.171
Hey, Mrs. Fritz.

29:43.173 --> 29:44.374
Nice night.

30:06.063 --> 30:07.164
Mom?

30:09.033 --> 30:10.034
Dad?

30:14.038 --> 30:16.575
[doll voice] <i>If you'll be my
friend I'll show you... Oh...</i>

30:18.209 --> 30:20.543
[quick high-pitched voice]

30:20.545 --> 30:25.248
[doll voice, laughing] <i>Children want
to see everything that's goin' on.</i>

30:25.250 --> 30:28.218
[laughing] <i>'Cause we
got a lot to say.</i>

30:28.220 --> 30:32.057
[laughing] <i>Hey! Knock, knock.</i>

30:33.191 --> 30:36.493
- <i>Who's there?</i>
- [high-pitched voice mumbling]

30:36.495 --> 30:37.262
[laughing]

30:39.498 --> 30:43.166
<i>Anybody home?</i>
[laughing] <i>Get it?</i>

30:43.168 --> 30:47.237
<i>Anybody home?</i> [laughing]
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

30:47.239 --> 30:48.407
- <i>Want to hear another one?</i>
- Dad?

30:51.544 --> 30:52.545
What are you doing?

31:08.829 --> 31:10.363
Everything's fine, Kayla.

31:14.668 --> 31:18.803
Um, uh, Kayla, I need to use
the restroom real quick.

31:18.805 --> 31:22.107
Yeah. Yeah, use
the one upstairs.

31:22.109 --> 31:23.410
[Zach] Okay, great.

31:56.210 --> 31:57.445
[whispering] Mrs. Shepard?

32:02.483 --> 32:03.351
Mrs. Shepard?

32:04.620 --> 32:05.721
[loud thump]

32:22.805 --> 32:23.772
Mrs. Shepard?

32:26.275 --> 32:27.376
[metallic noise]

32:49.466 --> 32:50.467
Mrs. Shepard?

32:54.772 --> 32:56.139
My mom says hi.

32:57.608 --> 32:58.441
She's good.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.913
[moaning sounds]

33:14.358 --> 33:15.259
Where's Zach?

33:16.627 --> 33:19.563
Oh, he's probably just,
he'll be down in a second.

33:25.971 --> 33:26.938
Mrs. Shepard?

33:43.022 --> 33:43.822
Mrs. Shepard?

34:30.471 --> 34:31.938
[gasping] Joey.

34:32.906 --> 34:34.806
[whispering] Daddy's scaring me.

34:34.808 --> 34:37.543
- What are you doing up here?
- I thought Mommy was up here.

34:39.313 --> 34:42.047
She-she has this liver disease.

34:42.050 --> 34:42.982
[dad] Where's Zach?

34:42.984 --> 34:45.051
[Kayla] I'm sure
he'll be right back down.

34:45.053 --> 34:46.520
He should be here.

34:47.956 --> 34:52.058
Uh, I mean it's just like,
he's just going to the bathroom right now.

34:52.060 --> 34:55.460
It'll take him, just give
him like a second.

34:55.463 --> 34:57.363
And he'll be back.

34:57.365 --> 34:58.833
He's probably...

34:59.834 --> 35:01.367
- He's going to the bathroom.
- It's not...

35:01.369 --> 35:03.503
- He's going to the-he's going to the bathroom.
- He's going to the bathroom.

35:03.505 --> 35:04.706
Hey, Zach, did you fall in?

35:08.610 --> 35:10.744
Joey, go to your room and hide.

35:10.746 --> 35:11.678
Okay.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.715
I'm going downstairs.

35:48.819 --> 35:50.652
[knocking on door]

35:50.654 --> 35:51.488
[dad] Zach?

35:53.657 --> 35:54.457
Coming!

35:57.427 --> 35:58.493
[banging on door]

35:58.495 --> 36:00.062
[dad] What's taking
so long, Zach?

36:00.064 --> 36:01.429
Just a minute.

36:01.431 --> 36:02.699
[banging on door]

36:07.672 --> 36:09.171
Uh, just a second!

36:09.173 --> 36:10.675
[banging on door]

36:17.048 --> 36:18.349
[dad] Zach?

36:28.426 --> 36:29.393
[banging on door]

36:30.561 --> 36:32.561
Why are you in here?

36:32.563 --> 36:36.134
Um, I'm actually really sorry. The,
it was the, uh, first bathroom that I saw.

36:40.606 --> 36:42.107
[Zach] We really
have to be going.

36:46.678 --> 36:47.646
Excuse me.

36:55.221 --> 36:57.023
Zach? Zach!

36:59.926 --> 37:00.791
Hey.

37:00.793 --> 37:02.095
- We have to keep going.
- What happened?

37:03.096 --> 37:04.262
What happened?
What happened?

37:04.264 --> 37:06.497
- You don't want to see it.
- Would you look at me, please?

37:06.499 --> 37:07.932
You don't want to see it.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.068
Give me your phone.

37:20.247 --> 37:22.448
[knocking on door]

37:25.152 --> 37:26.718
[dad] <i>Zach?</i>

37:26.720 --> 37:28.856
- [Randy] Oh, Jesus.
- [Kayla cries]

37:45.173 --> 37:47.808
- Kayla, I'm so sorry.
- [crying]

37:49.144 --> 37:50.444
They're killing people now.

37:53.982 --> 37:55.748
Oh my, God.

37:55.750 --> 37:58.051
Oh my, God, wait,
Joey's in there.

37:58.053 --> 37:59.519
We have to go get Joey.

37:59.521 --> 38:01.089
We will. We will.

38:03.258 --> 38:04.092
How?

38:06.661 --> 38:09.196
Pastor Greg and the
Sheriff are in on this.

38:09.198 --> 38:10.966
[Kayla crying]

38:57.315 --> 38:58.682
Jesus Christ.

38:59.649 --> 39:01.585
You swear that this is real?

39:02.652 --> 39:04.821
- 'Cause if you guys are punking me...
- It's real.

39:18.736 --> 39:20.302
[door squeaks open]

39:20.304 --> 39:21.072
[footsteps]

39:24.042 --> 39:25.877
There's absolutely
nothing up there.

39:27.845 --> 39:29.212
He must have moved her body.

39:29.214 --> 39:31.048
You saw it! You
saw it on the video!

39:31.050 --> 39:32.115
Why did you kill her?

39:32.117 --> 39:33.383
Calm down.

39:33.385 --> 39:36.889
Look, I do need an explanation
as to what is on that video.

39:41.994 --> 39:43.595
Is there a problem, officer?

39:45.831 --> 39:46.665
Mom?

39:49.802 --> 39:50.669
Mom.

40:05.018 --> 40:07.754
You-you're not my mom.

40:09.756 --> 40:11.656
I'm sorry, Deputy Haywood.

40:11.658 --> 40:15.028
We've been dealing with Kayla's
mental illness for some time now.

40:16.029 --> 40:17.762
There was a video.

40:17.764 --> 40:18.996
False.

40:18.998 --> 40:20.267
Just like their show.

40:22.236 --> 40:25.705
You know I would have expected more
professionalism from you, Josh.

40:28.142 --> 40:29.740
[Josh] Sorry for
the disturbance.

40:29.742 --> 40:30.943
We'll be on our way.

40:30.945 --> 40:32.980
No! No, no, no.
Come on, Joey. Come on.

40:33.914 --> 40:34.715
No!

40:35.850 --> 40:37.416
I want to go with Kayla.

40:37.418 --> 40:38.917
He wants to come.

40:38.919 --> 40:40.018
Come on.
Just come with us.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.920
It doesn't matter what he wants.

40:41.922 --> 40:43.722
He belongs to me.

40:43.724 --> 40:45.325
What are you?

40:45.327 --> 40:46.326
Go to your room.

40:46.328 --> 40:49.695
There is no way in hell
that I'm going anywhere.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.300
I am your father.
You have to do what I say!

40:54.869 --> 40:57.103
You're just gonna let her go?

40:57.105 --> 41:00.142
Yeah. You know, I think
that is gonna be best.

41:06.314 --> 41:07.249
[door closes]

41:11.987 --> 41:15.222
Yeah, you all played me for a fool
with that little freak show back there.

41:15.224 --> 41:16.524
Jesus Christ! I mean gee,
really, I should take

41:16.526 --> 41:18.791
- you both in for filing a false police report.
- No, you don't,

41:18.793 --> 41:20.494
You don't even see what's
going on right in front of you.

41:20.496 --> 41:23.464
I don't-you know what I see?
I see what you're doing to that girl.

41:23.466 --> 41:25.432
Okay? Don't be those guys.

41:25.434 --> 41:27.837
Tell me that that all felt
right in there, Deputy.

41:29.005 --> 41:31.038
Josh, how's the Sheriff?

41:31.040 --> 41:32.141
You know what, Zach?

41:36.513 --> 41:37.747
I don't have time for this.

41:39.316 --> 41:40.681
We need him.

41:40.683 --> 41:43.451
Dude, this is way bigger than
this Podunk sheriff's department.

41:43.453 --> 41:45.253
We need to get Joey.

41:45.255 --> 41:47.023
[car starts]

41:49.526 --> 41:50.260
Right.

41:51.161 --> 41:54.264
We get our parents,
then we get Joey,

41:55.532 --> 41:57.167
and get our footage uploaded.

41:58.569 --> 42:01.469
Once people see what's going on
here, they'll send people to help.

42:01.471 --> 42:03.106
And we get the hell out of here.

42:14.152 --> 42:15.153
We'll get him.

42:16.421 --> 42:17.355
Come on.

42:38.143 --> 42:42.279
I don't get it. I'm trying to upload my
footage, but there's still no service.

42:42.281 --> 42:43.449
Randy, do you got anything?

42:46.051 --> 42:46.917
No.

42:46.919 --> 42:48.053
Kayla, what about you?

43:00.199 --> 43:01.468
[banging noises]

43:15.849 --> 43:18.485
You know what? Just
Randy and I should go in.

43:24.924 --> 43:25.624
Fine.

43:25.626 --> 43:27.925
I'll see if I can find your mom.

43:27.927 --> 43:28.828
Thank you.

43:36.604 --> 43:38.472
Does anyone ever
work in that barn?

43:40.007 --> 43:40.574
No.

43:43.044 --> 43:45.413
[banging continues]

43:58.660 --> 43:59.461
Dad?

44:00.928 --> 44:01.530
Dad?

44:22.117 --> 44:23.453
Hello, boys.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.355
Where's mom?

44:27.423 --> 44:33.327
We should, uh, get out of town pretty
quick. There's some weird stuff going on.

44:33.329 --> 44:34.430
Zach.

44:35.698 --> 44:38.000
What are you talking about?

44:43.607 --> 44:44.608
Oh, God.

44:50.146 --> 44:51.713
Where's Mom?

44:51.715 --> 44:54.349
Everything's fine.

44:54.351 --> 44:56.016
- What did you do to Mom?
- It's not him.

44:56.018 --> 44:57.254
Come on, we need to go.

45:18.976 --> 45:20.010
What are you doing?

45:21.646 --> 45:24.046
Wait! No, no, no!
No, no, no! No, no, no!

45:24.048 --> 45:25.016
- Hey!
- No!

45:26.551 --> 45:27.650
[quick taps running]

45:27.652 --> 45:28.486
[Zach] What was that?

45:46.338 --> 45:48.272
[screams]

45:48.274 --> 45:49.540
Oh, shit!

45:49.542 --> 45:50.741
Not funny.

45:50.743 --> 45:52.409
Dude, turn the light.

45:52.411 --> 45:53.612
[quick taps]

45:56.315 --> 45:58.315
[faint groaning]

45:58.317 --> 45:59.151
Who's there?

46:01.220 --> 46:01.786
Mom?

46:01.788 --> 46:03.422
[faint groaning]

46:07.494 --> 46:09.161
[groaning gets closer]

46:26.146 --> 46:27.180
No!

46:28.381 --> 46:30.281
Randy, are you okay?

46:30.283 --> 46:32.385
[moans] I think
something bit me.

46:33.454 --> 46:34.354
Are you okay?

46:36.156 --> 46:37.057
Oh, shit!

46:38.258 --> 46:39.592
- Where'd it go?
- [quick taps]

46:39.594 --> 46:41.395
[groaning]

46:47.768 --> 46:49.403
Randy, be careful.

46:59.681 --> 47:01.280
Zach?

47:01.282 --> 47:04.149
What? What is it?

47:04.151 --> 47:05.119
What the hell?

47:12.194 --> 47:14.363
[squishing noises]

47:23.806 --> 47:25.405
[SCREAMS]

47:25.407 --> 47:26.375
[screams]

47:30.813 --> 47:32.348
Oh, shit!

Mom?

47:47.630 --> 47:49.265
[screams]

47:52.402 --> 47:54.736
No. Mom! Mom! Get off her!

47:54.738 --> 47:56.505
[woman screams]

47:56.507 --> 47:57.340

48:01.879 --> 48:04.214

Get off!

48:13.257 --> 48:15.626
[screams]

48:21.833 --> 48:22.867
Zach,

48:24.669 --> 48:26.203
that wasn't me.

48:27.672 --> 48:28.473
I had to kill her.

48:29.674 --> 48:30.442
Zach?

48:32.344 --> 48:34.210
[groans]

48:34.212 --> 48:35.480
[woman] No!

48:49.361 --> 48:52.730
Come on. You guys, we gotta go!
They're coming back. Come on!

48:52.732 --> 48:53.666
Oh, let's go.

48:54.867 --> 48:56.235
[Kayla] Come on, hurry!

49:12.653 --> 49:13.754
[Randy] Look at that.

49:34.741 --> 49:35.709
What happened?

49:42.917 --> 49:43.818
We gotta go.

49:51.826 --> 49:52.660
Zach,

49:53.628 --> 49:54.962
we gotta go, okay?

50:39.642 --> 50:41.578
[nature sounds]

50:55.993 --> 50:57.726
[Randy] How do we know it's him?

50:57.728 --> 51:01.498
I mean we don't,
but who else is there?

51:39.104 --> 51:41.072
You got a shitty
poker face, Randy.

51:45.744 --> 51:47.046
What were you going
to do with that?

51:50.783 --> 51:51.851
Yeah.

51:53.152 --> 51:54.452
Come on.

52:02.728 --> 52:03.796
[door closes]

52:16.009 --> 52:17.610
So we know we're
all right, but...

52:19.146 --> 52:20.413
All right.

52:23.482 --> 52:24.850
Oh, Jesus.

52:24.852 --> 52:25.853
Oh, my God.

52:28.555 --> 52:29.523
[Josh] Yeah.

52:30.657 --> 52:34.595
So one of those things bit
me, but I kept my eyes open.

52:35.596 --> 52:37.129
We are going to need
to take it with us though.

52:37.131 --> 52:38.730
What? Why?

52:38.732 --> 52:39.999
Oh, you're still filming, right?

52:40.001 --> 52:44.839
- Yeah.
- So we take that thing and the footage to the FBI.

52:45.807 --> 52:47.106
That'll get them
to move their asses.

52:47.108 --> 52:48.608
Yes.

52:48.610 --> 52:49.811
I'm sorry though.

52:51.646 --> 52:53.413
I should have believed you guys.

53:01.522 --> 53:02.989
What in the hell are they?

53:02.991 --> 53:04.157
[Zach] I don't know.

53:04.159 --> 53:05.693
Do you guys think
they might be aliens?

53:07.695 --> 53:09.729
Here's what we do know.

53:09.731 --> 53:10.797
First they bite you.

53:10.799 --> 53:12.968
[screams]

53:14.535 --> 53:15.636
Then they turn into you.

53:15.638 --> 53:17.573
[Zach] But not right away.

53:19.475 --> 53:20.709
It's more like a copy.

53:22.811 --> 53:24.912
And they act like an animal.

53:24.914 --> 53:28.582
And then they, they...

53:28.584 --> 53:30.052
[screaming]

53:31.487 --> 53:36.993
Well, maybe they bite you to get
your DNA and then they clone you.

53:38.028 --> 53:41.796
You know, but the clone, it doesn't
have any of the original memories so

53:41.798 --> 53:44.968
it has to like find you
and just-and just take them.

53:54.911 --> 53:56.911
There's someone out there.

53:56.913 --> 53:58.515
- [Zach] What?
- [Kayla] What do you mean?

54:21.872 --> 54:22.773
Oh, shit!

54:24.309 --> 54:25.110
Shit!

54:26.979 --> 54:27.810
[banging]

54:27.812 --> 54:29.279
Oh, my God.

54:29.281 --> 54:30.514
[banging]

54:36.621 --> 54:38.023
- All right, get down, get down!
- [Kayla gasps]

54:40.892 --> 54:42.561
[banging]

54:50.068 --> 54:52.136
[animal-like moan]

54:52.138 --> 54:53.270
What the hell was that?

54:53.272 --> 54:54.904
You should call for backup.

54:54.906 --> 54:56.042
Let's just get out of here.

54:59.212 --> 55:01.045
[screams]

55:01.047 --> 55:01.948
Get it!

55:03.082 --> 55:04.549
[groaning]

55:06.352 --> 55:08.753
Randy, he's here for you! Move
away! Move away! Go, go, go!

55:08.755 --> 55:10.123
[Randy] Where? Where? Where?

55:16.095 --> 55:17.329
They're here!

55:17.331 --> 55:18.798
Josh? Josh?

55:20.167 --> 55:20.833
Shit.

55:25.339 --> 55:27.139
Randy, stay away
from that window.

55:27.141 --> 55:27.975
[screams]

55:37.985 --> 55:38.752
Shit.

55:39.653 --> 55:40.754
