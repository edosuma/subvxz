00:00.250 --> 00:01.830
ANNOUNCER: Previously,
on "Nashville"...

00:01.830 --> 00:03.790
- I want us to
write our story.

00:03.790 --> 00:05.210
- You're gonna film us
while we're writing?

00:05.210 --> 00:06.880
- I promise I won't
get in the way.

00:08.580 --> 00:10.580
(phone ringing)
- Hello?

00:10.580 --> 00:12.460
- Where are you?
I've been texting and calling!

00:12.460 --> 00:13.750
- What happened?

00:13.750 --> 00:15.620
(crying)

00:15.620 --> 00:17.500
- No!

00:17.500 --> 00:18.960
- You're her daughter,
who better to sing

00:18.960 --> 00:20.830
a tribute to her than you?

00:20.830 --> 00:26.120
- ♪ Let me be your sanctuary ♪

00:31.750 --> 00:33.000
- Okay.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.830
Fork to mouth just
one time...for me, please?

00:34.830 --> 00:36.670
Here.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.000
Plug your nose and try, Daph.
Look...

00:39.460 --> 00:41.290
- If I do, can I
stay home again?

00:41.290 --> 00:43.080
- Well, you got to go back
to school sometime,

00:43.080 --> 00:44.540
but it doesn't
have to be today.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.830
- This damn toaster
won't work.

00:45.830 --> 00:47.960
- Here. Have some eggs.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.170
- I don't want the eggs.
I just...

00:49.170 --> 00:50.460
(cell phone rings)

00:50.460 --> 00:53.170
...want a piece of toast.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.460
- Hello?

00:55.460 --> 00:56.920
Sorry, I can't
talk right now.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.750
- Who was that?

00:58.750 --> 01:01.250
- Some person from
a TV show in New York.

01:01.250 --> 01:04.080
It's like the 10th person
that's called.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.290
Don't even know how they got
my number in the first place.

01:06.290 --> 01:07.830
- The nerve of some people.

01:07.830 --> 01:09.380
If you don't recognize
the number, don't pick it up.

01:09.380 --> 01:10.500
That's my policy, all right?

01:10.500 --> 01:11.620
(cell phone rings)

01:16.420 --> 01:17.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:17.750 --> 01:20.380
I was just
calling to check in.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.580
Let you know that I'm here if
you need me...for anything.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.080
Even if it's just
to sit next to you.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.830
- Thank you. I mean it.

01:30.830 --> 01:32.620
- I know work is
the last thing

01:32.620 --> 01:34.460
anyone wants to talk
about right now.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.420
But, um, here's
where we are.

01:37.420 --> 01:39.210
We have found a great tour
for you guys.

01:39.210 --> 01:41.620
The headliner
is Margo Price.

01:41.620 --> 01:43.250
She's a big fan
on account of your video.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.830
- Yeah, love Margaret Price.
- How soon does it start?

01:45.830 --> 01:48.040
- Uh, two weeks from
today in Memphis.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.620
- I don't know if
I can leave that soon.

01:49.620 --> 01:54.000
- Do you have a conflict?
- No. I just...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.500
- What?

01:57.120 --> 01:59.750
What?
- Nothing, nothing. I'm good.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.000
- Okay. The last thing I think
we need to start

02:02.000 --> 02:04.620
talking about is how
we're gonna release

02:04.620 --> 02:07.920
Rayna's final album
to the public.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.210
- It's not finished.

02:10.210 --> 02:12.710
- Okay. When will it be ready?

02:15.500 --> 02:17.420
- Never?

02:17.420 --> 02:20.580
- Deacon, I understand
this is incredibly raw.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.750
But, you know, a lot
of important albums

02:23.750 --> 02:25.920
from the Basement Tapes
to the Smile Sessions,

02:25.920 --> 02:27.460
they were released unfinished.

02:27.460 --> 02:30.040
- Yeah, those are good.
- Yes, they are.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.710
- Rayna would not
have wanted that.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.290
- Okay. Well, I can't
speak for that.

02:33.290 --> 02:35.170
But I do know that Rayna
was proud of this album.

02:35.170 --> 02:36.920
And I know that there are
millions of people out there

02:36.920 --> 02:38.120
who are desperate
to hear the final things

02:38.120 --> 02:40.620
that she had to say.
I don't know.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.330
Don't you think
we maybe owe it to her fans?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.880
- The only person I owe
anything to is Rayna.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.500
(knocking on door)

02:50.500 --> 02:51.880
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hi.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.330
Just dropping
a few things off.

02:53.330 --> 02:54.710
Seeing how everyone's
holding up.

02:54.710 --> 02:56.500
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi, Bo.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.290
- Where would you
like all this?

02:58.290 --> 03:00.710
- Anywhere it will fit.
We're kind of overstocked

03:00.710 --> 03:02.670
and I can't get
anybody to eat, so...

03:02.670 --> 03:04.380
- Hey. I am so sorry to put
you on the spot like that.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.830
(phone ringing)

03:05.830 --> 03:07.420
But you sounded
so damn beautiful

03:07.420 --> 03:09.330
singing your mama's song.
- Thank you.

03:09.330 --> 03:10.710
- Who is this?

03:10.710 --> 03:12.120
All right, well,
this is her cousin.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.290
And there's a recently
bereaved 17-year-old

03:13.290 --> 03:15.120
that you've been harassing

03:15.120 --> 03:16.460
and we'd all really
appreciate it if you could stop.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.250
Thank you.
- Who was that?

03:18.250 --> 03:19.670
- I don't know.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.120
Early morning,
late night show.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.880
One of the Jimmy's.
Don't ask me which one.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.960
- Are you telling me
she's getting offers

03:24.960 --> 03:26.460
to appear on
national television

03:26.460 --> 03:27.290
and you're hanging up on them?

03:27.290 --> 03:29.460
- Constantly.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.380
- Tell me there's at least
a manager that's quarterbacking.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.170
What?

03:35.170 --> 03:37.000
The girl's having a moment.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Whether it's good
timing or bad.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.710
These shows are gonna
give you an opportunity

03:41.710 --> 03:43.960
to play your music
on a bigger stage.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.380
Isn't that what
you've always wanted?

03:45.380 --> 03:47.210
- It's just a lot at once.

03:47.210 --> 03:48.540
- It's not like the train
is leaving the station

03:48.540 --> 03:50.290
and she's gonna miss it.
She's amazing.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.960
I just feel like it's all
hands on deck at the moment.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.830
(sighs)

03:54.830 --> 03:57.330
- I could take her
to New York.

03:57.330 --> 04:00.960
I'm not kidding.
Avery can look after Cadence.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.750
I am a different person
that whatever that look

04:03.750 --> 04:06.250
that you just gave me implied.
- I'm not implying nothing.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.540
I just feel like family should
be together right now.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.380
- What about you, Maddie?
- Hmm?

04:11.380 --> 04:12.790
- What are you feeling?

04:12.790 --> 04:14.330
- I feel like the only
reason people really want

04:14.330 --> 04:16.040
to talk to me is
'cause I just

04:16.040 --> 04:18.330
cried on television
in front of the whole world.

04:18.330 --> 04:19.500
- No.
- What?

04:19.500 --> 04:21.210
- That's not why, all right?

04:21.210 --> 04:23.380
It's 'cause you got up
on a big stage

04:23.380 --> 04:25.420
in the hardest
situation imaginable.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.920
And you were magical.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.380
You were beautiful.
And the world saw that.

04:30.380 --> 04:31.790
You wanna go?

04:36.380 --> 04:38.250
- I will take care of her
like she is my own.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.920
You know that.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.580
- You should have seen him.
He was just a wreck.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.670
And when I brought
up Rayna's album...

04:48.670 --> 04:50.750
- Yeah, well,
I'm sure he's grieving.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.170
- We all grieve differently.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.380
And just because
I channel it into work

04:53.380 --> 04:54.880
doesn't mean I'm a monster.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.880
- Yeah, well,
no one's saying that.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.790
- I feel like he can't see
that I'm doing this for Rayna.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.790
I'm doing this for her
company, for her legacy.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.620
- Maybe with time...

05:02.620 --> 05:04.460
- Well, that's the thing.
There is no time.

05:04.460 --> 05:06.460
Now is the moment.
The whole world's watching.

05:06.460 --> 05:08.330
That won't last.

05:10.420 --> 05:13.290
I don't know.
Maybe he'd listen to you.

05:13.290 --> 05:15.620
- Me?
- Yeah.

05:15.620 --> 05:17.960
I mean, I'm not from here.
I'm not a fellow artist.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.290
- Me and Deacon don't
know each other

05:19.290 --> 05:20.880
that particularly well,
to be honest.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.880
- Okay, but you are made
from the same clay.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.790
Would you try it?
Please?

05:28.880 --> 05:31.500
- Okay.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.120
- Oh!
- Let me take you. Yes.

05:34.120 --> 05:37.920
- Let's go, girl!
- One second.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.330
Okay, you promise this
is okay, Dad?

05:39.330 --> 05:41.210
- Of course, it is, yes.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.380
- Even though
I'm leaving you and Daph?

05:42.380 --> 05:43.620
- Honey, look, if
your mom was here,

05:43.620 --> 05:45.000
I have no doubt she'd
be nervous for you.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.040
But she would be
so excited too.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.500
So you go.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.790
- Okay.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.330
Love you.
- Love you.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.210
- This city just makes you
feel alive, doesn't it?

06:26.210 --> 06:29.210
- You know, I don't really have
the best memories of it, but...

06:29.210 --> 06:31.380
- Well, now
you're with me.

06:31.380 --> 06:34.790
So we're just gonna
make a bunch of new ones.

06:34.790 --> 06:36.380
Okay?
- Okay.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.420
- Zach cares.
He really does.

06:40.420 --> 06:42.540
His way of showing it
is by trying

06:42.540 --> 06:44.920
to keep Rayna's company
doing well.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.540
But without this album,

06:46.540 --> 06:47.920
he's just not optimistic
about its chances.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.330
- Yeah, well,
technically, he's right.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.540
I mean, our
acquisition of Wheelin'

06:50.540 --> 06:52.420
has us in the red
for the near future.

06:52.420 --> 06:54.620
We thought our deal with
Zach didn't have a down side

06:54.620 --> 06:56.670
because either of us could
pull out at any moment.

06:56.670 --> 06:59.580
But that was before we
took on a boatload of debt.

06:59.580 --> 07:03.460
So now if he decides to yank
his money out, we're dead.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.040
- Hang on.
Nobody's said anything

07:05.040 --> 07:06.830
about Zach
threatening to leave.

07:06.830 --> 07:08.120
Zach is not the enemy here.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.250
He just wants
to be met halfway.

07:11.710 --> 07:14.170
- Deacon?
- Yeah.

07:14.170 --> 07:18.170
I'll think about it, Will.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.250
(fanfare on TV)

07:20.250 --> 07:21.460
- From Comedy Central's
World News headquarters...

07:21.460 --> 07:23.250
- Ooh, Juliette,
I'm freaking out!

07:23.250 --> 07:25.580
I don't think I can do this.
- You can do this.

07:25.580 --> 07:27.080
- I can't go on
and talk about my mom.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.790
I'm gonna lose it.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.750
- The only thing you have to
do out there is be yourself.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.500
The adrenalin's gonna
get you through, I promise.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.080
- Our next guest won
our hearts at the CMTs,

07:37.080 --> 07:39.330
and now she's ready to take
the music world by storm.

07:39.330 --> 07:41.420
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Maddie Jaymes!

07:41.420 --> 07:43.120
(cheering)

07:50.170 --> 07:52.380
- They love you.
- Awesome.

07:52.380 --> 07:53.880
- They love you.
Welcome to the show.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.500
- Thank you so much.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.330
- Thank you so
much for being here.

07:57.330 --> 07:59.580
All of us are great fans.
And let me start, if I may,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.540
by conveying my
deepest condolences.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.080
All of America
is really brokenhearted

08:03.080 --> 08:04.920
over what happened.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.460
- Thank you.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.380
- Now I was so moved
by your performance

08:08.380 --> 08:10.460
of your mother's song
the other night.

08:10.460 --> 08:12.540
What was going through
your mind

08:12.540 --> 08:14.000
when you walked out
on the stage?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.880
- Uh, I was trying
not to throw up.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.620
(chuckles)

08:18.620 --> 08:20.920
- That's fair.
It's completely fair.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.120
I mean, I can't imagine what
it's been like for you.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.500
Are you holding up okay?

08:26.500 --> 08:27.920
- Yeah.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.710
I've just spent a lot of time
at home with my family.

08:35.830 --> 08:36.830
Um...

08:36.830 --> 08:38.790
I'm sorry.

08:38.790 --> 08:40.420
I don't know if I can talk
more about this right now.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.000
- That's fine. We can talk
about something else.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.830
Let's talk about your music.

08:44.830 --> 08:46.000
I've heard that in addition
to your beautiful voice,

08:46.000 --> 08:47.880
you write all your
own music as well?

08:47.880 --> 08:50.040
- Yeah. My sister and I,
we've been writing

08:50.040 --> 08:51.880
since we could hold a guitar.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.750
And recently I've been
putting together

08:53.750 --> 08:55.790
a bunch of songs in hopes
to make my first album.

08:55.790 --> 08:56.790
- That is so exciting.
- So exciting.

08:56.790 --> 08:58.330
- You guys are excited, right?
Yeah, you know what?

08:58.330 --> 09:00.040
In fact, I'm going to buy
an advanced copy right now.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.250
- No.
- That's what I'm gonna do.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.790
- Yeah, no, I've got the money.
- Please, no.

09:02.790 --> 09:03.620
- There we go.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.540
You just tell me when it's done,
you'll send it to me?

09:05.540 --> 09:07.500
- You will get it for free only
'cause you've been so nice.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.330
- It's my only $10. Thank you.
I'm really excited for this.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.330
- Thank you.
- I hope yo deliver.

09:10.330 --> 09:12.330
- Well, thank you so much.

09:12.330 --> 09:14.000
- Well, thank you very much
for coming to the show.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.960
- Thank you for having me.
- I'm excited to hear the album.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.380
Everyone else is as well.
- Thank you.

09:18.380 --> 09:19.420
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Maddie Jaymes!

09:19.420 --> 09:20.620
- Thanks, guys.
- (cheering)

09:23.080 --> 09:25.540
- It's after your bedtime.
Go get ready.

09:32.790 --> 09:33.500
- You okay?

09:37.040 --> 09:39.420
What you wrestling with in
that big brain of yours?

09:39.420 --> 09:44.670
- Every time I think of mom,
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

09:44.670 --> 09:46.830
So I tell my brain not
to think of her,

09:46.830 --> 09:50.170
and somehow that makes me
think of her way more.

09:50.170 --> 09:53.830
- I did exactly the same
thing when I lost my mama.

09:53.830 --> 09:55.540
I tried so hard not
to think about her.

09:55.540 --> 09:58.790
And eventually,
I realized that sometimes

09:58.790 --> 10:00.960
the best medicine
is to go ahead

10:00.960 --> 10:02.750
and think about
her all you want.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.080
Reflect on her
and all the good

10:05.080 --> 10:09.330
and you realize that
all of that good

10:09.330 --> 10:13.750
is still right there
inside of you.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.500
She's right there
in your heart.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.420
- Why did they want Maddie
and not both of us?

10:19.420 --> 10:22.080
We both sing.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.380
- Well, that is because
the world is shallow.

10:24.380 --> 10:27.000
And people are obsessed
with beautiful young women.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.250
Which is actually
good for you

10:28.250 --> 10:32.580
since you are fast
becoming one.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.250
You want to sing one
of your mama's songs maybe?

10:37.210 --> 10:39.420
- I don't want to.
I'm sorry. Goodnight.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.420
- 'Night.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.500
- I just wanted
to say your singing,

11:04.500 --> 11:06.210
it really touched me and...
- Thank you so much.

11:06.210 --> 11:07.710
- Yeah.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.330
I hope you know that you
have something special.

11:09.330 --> 11:10.880
So, you know, don't ever stop.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.210
- You know, I actually
have a confession.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.040
I might be the only person
in America

11:14.040 --> 11:16.000
who missed your storied
performance the other night.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.920
- That's okay.
- Wait.

11:17.920 --> 11:18.670
Are you being
serious right now?

11:18.670 --> 11:20.000
- Yeah, unfortunately.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.830
- Well, I mean, you know what
needs to happen then, right?

11:21.830 --> 11:24.420
- What?
- You have to sing it.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.460
- Right now?
- Yeah. Would you?

11:26.460 --> 11:28.250
- Maybe just catch
it on YouTube?

11:28.250 --> 11:30.210
- I'm trying everything to
get you to sing it here.

11:30.210 --> 11:31.710
Please?
For both of us?

11:31.710 --> 11:34.080
- Please?

13:50.580 --> 13:52.540
One, two, three, four...

13:52.540 --> 13:58.380
(playing country music)

13:58.380 --> 14:01.250
(laughs)

14:01.250 --> 14:04.620
Okay, okay, let's do this
one more time from the top.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.920
- Sorry, guys.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.580
- One, two,
one-two-three-four...

14:20.120 --> 14:21.420
- RAYNA: "I feel like
I'm standing

14:21.420 --> 14:24.170
"on the edge of a hurricane

14:24.170 --> 14:26.420
"and it's lifting my
feet off the ground,

14:26.420 --> 14:29.380
"like my whole body
is vibrating

14:29.380 --> 14:33.210
"and some higher force is
moving my arms and my legs

14:33.210 --> 14:35.710
"and it is scaring the
living daylights out of me.

14:35.710 --> 14:37.670
"Like I'm on
a high precipice

14:37.670 --> 14:39.920
"and there are
only two options:

14:39.920 --> 14:43.460
I'm either gonna run far away
or dive straight in."

14:43.460 --> 14:46.250
- Rayna!
- Open the door, lovebirds.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.290
- Woo!

14:53.540 --> 14:56.420
(audience cheering)

14:56.420 --> 14:58.080
- So, Maddie, you know
that you're everywhere

14:58.080 --> 14:59.830
this week, right?

14:59.830 --> 15:01.750
- I don't know about that.
- I'm serious.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.670
All over social media.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.210
I asked my daughters
if they saw it.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.670
And they were like,
yeah, of course, we did.

15:06.670 --> 15:07.790
Everybody saw it.

15:07.790 --> 15:10.000
(applause)
- Oh, my gosh.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.500
- You know, I had the pleasure
of meeting your mom

15:11.500 --> 15:13.460
and I was a really
big fan of hers.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.620
And I have to tell you.
I'm looking at you right now

15:15.620 --> 15:18.080
and you are
the spitting image of her.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.210
It's incredible.
- Well, thank you.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.250
"Blue Light, Red Light" is like
my sister's favorite album.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.830
- But not your favorite?
Just your sister's...

15:23.830 --> 15:25.670
- No, it's one of mine, too.

15:25.670 --> 15:27.250
(laughs)
One of mine, too.

15:27.250 --> 15:30.080
- So, obviously,
the circumstances, your loss,

15:30.080 --> 15:33.290
this has to be
a confusing time for you,

15:33.290 --> 15:34.790
a very difficult
time for you.

15:34.790 --> 15:37.580
Are you able to kind
of enjoy any of it?

15:37.580 --> 15:39.460
- I'm trying to be
open to the idea

15:39.460 --> 15:41.330
that, you know, the world
works in mysterious ways

15:41.330 --> 15:43.790
and bad things can come
from good intentions

15:43.790 --> 15:45.790
and good things can come
from tragedy.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.460
Obviously,
I'm not all like,

15:47.460 --> 15:49.120
thanks, Mom, for all
the attention I'm getting.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.670
(chuckles)

15:50.670 --> 15:52.210
- That's a good way
to look at it.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.250
You're wise beyond
your years, Maddie.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.170
- Thanks.

15:55.170 --> 15:56.750
- We'll have more with
Maddie Jaymes when we come back.

15:59.540 --> 16:00.830
- Daph, maybe she
didn't mean it like that.

16:00.830 --> 16:02.420
- Just leave me alone, please!

16:06.080 --> 16:09.000
- Gunnar, I'm so sorry.
I can't do this to her.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.540
- Wait, wait.
What are you talking about?

16:11.540 --> 16:14.170
- They need me too much.
I can't...

16:14.170 --> 16:16.120
- All right,
Scarlett, listen.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.710
You've done a great job
helping them, okay?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.460
You really have, but
you're not their caretaker.

16:19.460 --> 16:21.290
Deacon is.

16:21.290 --> 16:22.710
Seriously, I mean,
you keep telling the girls

16:22.710 --> 16:24.380
to put one foot
in front of the other.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.460
But what about you?

16:26.460 --> 16:28.290
You can't put your
life on hold forever.

16:28.290 --> 16:30.790
- Just...

16:30.790 --> 16:33.120
- What? What is it?

16:33.120 --> 16:34.880
- I can't leave them.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.460
(sighs)

16:40.460 --> 16:42.170
- We have a problem
here, people.

16:42.170 --> 16:43.580
And that's why I have
called this meeting

16:43.580 --> 16:44.920
so that we can put
our heads together

16:44.920 --> 16:46.420
and try and figure this out.

16:46.420 --> 16:49.040
So help me fix this.
Help me figure this out.

16:51.380 --> 16:55.250
Deacon, that album, whatever
state it is in, is an asset,

16:55.250 --> 16:56.460
something that
this company

16:56.460 --> 16:57.540
has precious little
of at the moment.

16:57.540 --> 16:58.960
- It's an asset.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.920
- Yes, and, sure, down the road,
Juliette will have a new record.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.880
And we need to get Maddie into
the studio as soon as possible.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.460
But right now, Deacon,
it's all we have.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.750
- It isn't finished, Zach.
I told you.

17:07.750 --> 17:08.880
- Okay, well,
then help me understand.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.040
What isn't finished about it?

17:11.040 --> 17:14.420
- They're duets, okay?
- And?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.830
- They're duets, Rayna's part,
that's just a scratch track.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.330
And I haven't done mine yet.

17:21.330 --> 17:23.460
I haven't done
my side of the duet.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.290
- Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm not the artist.

17:25.290 --> 17:27.460
But it does sound like
you can finish them.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.380
If we use her scratch vocals,
you add your vocals in...

17:29.380 --> 17:30.750
- Do you know what these
songs are about?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.540
- I get it, I get it...

17:32.540 --> 17:38.040
- They're about love!
They're about undying love!

17:38.040 --> 17:38.920
- Deacon, I'm trying
to help here.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.330
I'm trying to hear all sides.

17:40.330 --> 17:41.500
I'm trying to hear
all options...

17:41.500 --> 17:42.710
- Let's just quit going
around this thing!

17:42.710 --> 17:43.750
Go right to it, all right?

17:43.750 --> 17:45.580
You want something from me
that I'm not gonna give to you!

17:45.580 --> 17:47.290
That is clear!

17:47.290 --> 17:48.880
What is unclear is are
you threatening Highway...

17:48.880 --> 17:50.080
- What are you talking about?
- You heard me!

17:50.080 --> 17:51.830
It sounds like
you're threatening to...

17:51.830 --> 17:53.670
- Deacon, the world is
threatening us constantly!

17:53.670 --> 17:55.210
There's outstanding payments
to Wheelin' Dealin'.

17:55.210 --> 17:57.170
There's a tax due on Rayna's
estate at the end of the year.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.710
Do you want to hear
about these things?

17:58.710 --> 18:00.500
Because at the end of the day,
I need to know that.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.580
It's not a charity.
It's a business, Deacon.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.380
- Here we are.

18:03.380 --> 18:04.540
- And I should add
that's a good thing

18:04.540 --> 18:06.080
seeing as it supports
your two girls!

18:08.920 --> 18:11.830
- Come on, Zach.
- Don't you dare.

18:11.830 --> 18:13.620
- I'm sorry, Bucky.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.330
- Deacon, listen.
Listen just one second.

18:19.670 --> 18:21.000
Nobody knows better
than you what Rayna

18:21.000 --> 18:23.290
would have wanted creatively,
nobody.

18:23.290 --> 18:26.120
What Zach is asking and
what I'm asking,

18:26.120 --> 18:28.500
I need you just to take a step
back if you can for a second

18:28.500 --> 18:30.250
and think about what she would
have wanted for this company.

18:30.250 --> 18:33.290
She put so much of her heart
and soul into this company.

18:33.290 --> 18:35.170
- Do what you want with
the company, all right?

18:35.170 --> 18:37.710
I'm just... I'm done
listening to you

18:37.710 --> 18:38.880
trying to profit
off our grief.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.960
- Bucky, you gotta help here.
We're drowning.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.880
And I don't know
what else to do.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.580
- Just tell me what
you need, Zach,

18:56.580 --> 18:58.000
to feel confident
in your investment.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.920
- I need those audio files
by the end of the week.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.710
- I'm trying to be
open to the idea

19:08.710 --> 19:10.710
that, you know, the world
works in mysterious ways.

19:10.710 --> 19:13.000
And bad things can come
from good intentions.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.710
And good things can come
from tragedy.

19:14.710 --> 19:17.000
Obviously, I'm not all
like, thanks, Mom,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.330
for all the attention
I'm getting.

19:18.330 --> 19:19.920
(chuckles)

19:24.210 --> 19:25.290
(cell phone rings)

19:28.170 --> 19:29.670
- Maddie?
How you doing, baby?

19:29.670 --> 19:32.540
(crying)
- Honestly, I'm not good.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.830
- What's happening, baby?

19:34.830 --> 19:38.000
- Everyone is saying that
I don't care that my mom died.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.380
And I'm so sick

19:40.380 --> 19:42.000
and Juliette's saying
I have to do the show.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.170
- Maddie? Listen to me.

19:44.170 --> 19:46.790
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

19:46.790 --> 19:48.420
- I already told her I would.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.620
- I'm sure Juliette means well.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.380
But it doesn't
necessarily mean

19:51.380 --> 19:53.210
she knows what's best
for you at the moment.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.670
I mean, look at her life.

19:54.670 --> 19:56.040
Look at some of
the choices she has made.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.830
You come home whenever
you want to come home.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.750
In fact, you should come home.
Deacon needs you.

19:59.750 --> 20:03.500
- Wait. What?
What do you mean?

20:03.500 --> 20:05.580
- Nothing.
I just...sorry.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.170
I just feel like we should
all be there for him right now.

20:08.170 --> 20:09.710
- Mads, are you ready?

20:09.710 --> 20:11.290
We needed to be
there 15 minutes ago!

20:11.290 --> 20:13.120
(crying)

20:13.120 --> 20:15.250
What's going on?

20:15.250 --> 20:18.080
I thought you were
getting dressed.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.170
- I can't do it.

20:21.170 --> 20:23.710
I can't, I'm sorry.

20:23.710 --> 20:26.330
- What am I supposed
to tell the producers?

20:26.330 --> 20:28.330
- I don't know, Juliette.
I'm sorry.

20:28.330 --> 20:31.290
I just can't.
I can't.

20:31.290 --> 20:34.880
- Okay. I'll cancel it.

20:34.880 --> 20:38.170
- Okay. Thank you.

20:46.120 --> 20:50.000
- I just...I want her to stay
this size forever, you know?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.380
I do.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.540
- Yeah, it goes really fast.

20:53.540 --> 20:55.250
- RAYNA: "When I look in
my baby's eyes,

20:55.250 --> 20:57.330
"all I see is
him staring back.

20:57.330 --> 21:00.790
"His eyes, his soul,
his and mine together

21:00.790 --> 21:03.380
"in this beautiful
being we've created.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.540
"Oh, God, if Teddy
knew I felt this way,

21:05.540 --> 21:07.750
"it would just kill him.

21:07.750 --> 21:12.120
"But I hate that I can't
share this with Deacon.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.460
"I just don't see
any other path.

21:15.460 --> 21:19.210
"Not one that isn't paved
with more pain, more loss.

21:19.210 --> 21:21.380
"Can't stand it, though.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.170
"It's eating away at me.
It wears me down.

21:24.170 --> 21:27.290
"Each day, I pick up
the phone to call him.

21:27.290 --> 21:30.080
Each day, I lose my nerve."

21:31.960 --> 21:35.790
- ♪ Happy Birthday,
dear Maddie ♪

21:35.790 --> 21:40.620
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

21:40.620 --> 21:42.500
- Gonna blow it out?

21:42.500 --> 21:45.380
- Aw, baby.

21:45.380 --> 21:48.750
(knocking on door)

21:48.750 --> 21:50.290
- Not now, Scarlett, please.
I'm all right.

21:50.290 --> 21:51.880
- It's Avery.

21:54.710 --> 21:55.920
- Hold on, Avery, hold on.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.250
Hey.
- Hey.

22:01.250 --> 22:02.670
I was just
in the neighborhood.

22:02.670 --> 22:03.670
Thought I'd stop by
and say hi.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.330
- Oh, thank you.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.290
- Wanna grab some lunch?

22:08.290 --> 22:11.250
- Yeah, um, I don't think so.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.830
Not now.
I appreciate it, though.

22:12.830 --> 22:16.080
I'm just doing some stuff.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.620
- You know, if there's
anything that you want

22:18.620 --> 22:21.750
to talk about or
need to talk about,

22:21.750 --> 22:24.790
I just want you to know
that I'm here.

22:24.790 --> 22:27.080
- I appreciate that.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.210
I'll tell you what.

22:29.210 --> 22:30.920
Right now, the main thing
that's bugging me is that Zach

22:30.920 --> 22:34.710
is pressuring me to do
the album like yesterday.

22:34.710 --> 22:37.580
And I'm being stubborn

22:37.580 --> 22:41.120
and I'm not doing it.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.040
So I'm probably letting down
Highway 65 and the girls.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.670
And every other thing.

22:44.670 --> 22:50.330
But I can't even listen
to it, let alone...

22:52.460 --> 22:55.790
- Yeah, well, um, is
there anything you need?

22:55.790 --> 22:57.880
Is there anything I can do?
If you need anything...

22:57.880 --> 23:01.080
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
I mean it.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.210
- Yeah.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.250
- All right, thanks.

23:08.790 --> 23:10.380
- Whiskey Foxtrot Decade.

23:10.380 --> 23:13.790
- Roger that. Good target.
- Incoming!

23:15.580 --> 23:17.670
- Incoming!

23:17.670 --> 23:19.580
- You try so hard to do
the right thing

23:19.580 --> 23:22.620
and everyone turns you
into a villain.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.120
- Well, couldn't it
just be that

23:24.120 --> 23:26.540
not everyone sees it as
the right thing?

23:32.540 --> 23:34.540
- Are you turning
against me too?

23:34.540 --> 23:37.290
- No.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.790
No, no, I'm not...I'm not
doing anything like that.

23:42.500 --> 23:46.170
- It's so easy to hate
the guy with money.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.500
Everybody wants
something from me.

23:48.500 --> 23:52.210
Acquaintances, second cousins
with stupid schemes

23:52.210 --> 23:55.500
who then turn on a dime.
and they spew hatred at you

23:55.500 --> 23:57.000
if you don't shower them
with money.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.460
As if I don't bruise
like everybody else.

23:59.460 --> 24:02.920
- Hey, it's okay.

24:12.380 --> 24:14.420
- Daph!

24:14.420 --> 24:16.380
Oh, my God,
I missed you so much.

24:16.380 --> 24:19.830
- I'm so glad you're back.

24:19.830 --> 24:22.250
- I should have never gone.

24:22.250 --> 24:24.460
- You didn't do
anything wrong, babe.

24:24.460 --> 24:25.330
You did nothing
wrong at all.

24:25.330 --> 24:26.620
- Except be a horrible person!

24:26.620 --> 24:28.250
Are you kidding?
- No, no.

24:28.250 --> 24:29.250
It's just confusing
to have good things

24:29.250 --> 24:30.460
happen to you at
a time like this.

24:30.460 --> 24:31.620
That's all it is.

24:31.620 --> 24:32.540
- Just like...

24:33.880 --> 24:35.420
- I'll go upstairs.

24:38.380 --> 24:43.540
- I just forgot how sad
I was for one moment.

24:43.540 --> 24:48.420
And now I feel like
the worst daughter.

24:48.420 --> 24:54.210
- Hey, hey, you are
so far from that.

24:54.210 --> 24:56.420
If your mother
was here right now,

24:56.420 --> 24:59.380
she would be feeling one
thing and one thing only:

24:59.380 --> 25:01.330
proud of you.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.750
- Are you okay?

25:05.750 --> 25:08.210
- I'm getting there.

25:08.210 --> 25:10.960
- I'm worried about you.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.790
- That's one thing you don't
got to do, all right?

25:15.790 --> 25:17.460
(cell phone rings)

25:17.460 --> 25:19.170
Get that.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.500
- Hey, I'm sorry
I didn't call you earlier...

25:30.080 --> 25:31.460
(knocking on door)

25:31.460 --> 25:32.880
- Hi, Juliette.
- Hey, is Maddie here?

25:32.880 --> 25:33.880
- No, she's not.
- Yep.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.620
Hi!
- Hey.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.670
- I wanted to tell you
that I am disappointed

25:38.670 --> 25:42.040
in your lack of
professionalism in New York.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.540
That being said, I patched
things up with the Today Show

25:45.540 --> 25:48.250
and they're willing to give you
another opportunity next week.

25:48.250 --> 25:49.710
- You think you could
just wait one second?

25:49.710 --> 25:53.250
- Um, no. How about you wait?
And you listen?

25:53.250 --> 25:54.830
One of the most
amazing things

25:54.830 --> 25:56.580
in this world is when
you get your shot,

25:56.580 --> 25:58.290
and it doesn't come
when you want it to

25:58.290 --> 26:00.880
and it never comes again!
Okay?

26:00.880 --> 26:02.500
If you don't seize this,

26:02.500 --> 26:04.040
you will regret it for
the rest of your life.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.500
- Oh, my goodness!

26:05.500 --> 26:06.620
How can you say something
like that to her

26:06.620 --> 26:08.080
when clearly the timing
was not right?

26:08.080 --> 26:09.880
- Because it's the truth!

26:09.880 --> 26:11.420
The world doesn't wait
until you're ready!

26:11.420 --> 26:12.880
- I don't believe that.
And even if it were true,

26:12.880 --> 26:14.710
there are more important things
than chasing after fame!

26:14.710 --> 26:17.330
- How would you know?

26:17.330 --> 26:18.500
Just because you're
afraid of success

26:18.500 --> 26:19.880
doesn't mean you get
to make those...

26:19.880 --> 26:21.250
- Just stop!
Both of you just stop.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.000
- Maddie, sweetheart,
please wait.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.170
- Stop! Stop!

26:29.170 --> 26:31.250
- RAYNA: "Are we being crazy?

26:31.250 --> 26:33.120
"Giving this another shot?

26:33.120 --> 26:35.210
"Starting over again?

26:35.210 --> 26:37.960
"What if, after
all this waiting,

26:37.960 --> 26:39.960
"we just disappoint each other?

26:39.960 --> 26:41.790
"I know Deacon's the
love of my life.

26:41.790 --> 26:44.120
"But, you know,
we haven't done the dishes

26:44.120 --> 26:45.790
"and filed taxes.

26:45.790 --> 26:48.790
and all the boring stuff
that married couples do."

26:48.790 --> 26:50.250
(buzzer sounds)

26:53.710 --> 26:55.290
- Who is it?

26:55.290 --> 26:57.960
- Hey, it's Gunnar
and Bucky and Will.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.000
- Oh, what y'all want?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.170
- Hey, Scarlett, Zach really
needs a response on the album.

27:02.170 --> 27:03.790
Is Deacon home?

27:03.790 --> 27:06.580
- Yeah. Come on up.

27:06.580 --> 27:09.420
- RAYNA: "I think we are crazy
on some level.

27:09.420 --> 27:13.080
"But damn it, it's the kind of
crazy that just gives me hope.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.170
"Makes me feel human.

27:15.170 --> 27:18.080
"It's just the most beautiful
kind of crazy.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.710
"And it scares the
hell out of me.

27:19.710 --> 27:21.580
"There's one thing
I've learned.

27:21.580 --> 27:24.000
"I just got to jump right
into the heart of that fear.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.420
"Especially with this man.

27:26.420 --> 27:30.540
"Right now, I have this
electric feeling deep inside me.

27:30.540 --> 27:34.330
"And I swear after
all these years,

27:34.330 --> 27:36.960
"it feels like I'm 19 again

27:36.960 --> 27:39.670
"and we just locked eyes
for the first time.

27:39.670 --> 27:42.080
How about that?"

27:47.670 --> 27:50.040
(sighs)

27:58.210 --> 27:59.670
(knocking on door)

27:59.670 --> 28:01.710
- Deacon, would you mind
coming downstairs?

28:01.710 --> 28:03.500
There's something important
we need to go over with you.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.620
- I'm doing something important
right now, Scarlett.

28:05.620 --> 28:07.830
- Oh, well...

28:17.460 --> 28:19.210
- I know he needs
space, Scarlett.

28:19.210 --> 28:20.960
I know, and I'm trying to
be respectful of his space.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.040
But the fact is, it's not
just about Deacon right now.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.580
- You need to leave him alone!
It is about him!

28:24.580 --> 28:26.380
- This is a unique
situation, Scarlett.

28:26.380 --> 28:29.000
There's so many people that
depend on this decision, right?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.420
It's not just me.
It's not just Deacon.

28:30.420 --> 28:32.210
This affects everybody.
Am I right?

28:32.210 --> 28:33.620
- It's our careers.
It's Bucky's job.

28:33.620 --> 28:34.670
It's the girls' inheritance.

28:34.670 --> 28:35.830
- You can't come in here

28:35.830 --> 28:37.040
and make all of that
that man's problem.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.540
It's not his fault!

28:38.540 --> 28:40.380
- No!
- Nobody's angry at Deacon.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.210
We're worried about him.
- We just need him to act!

28:42.210 --> 28:43.670
- What the hell are
you guys talking about?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.380
Look, we all write about
heartbreak for a living

28:49.380 --> 28:51.540
and now that it's
staring us in the face,

28:51.540 --> 28:53.080
it's like we're
afraid of it.

28:53.080 --> 28:56.500
We judge it like
it's strange or weird.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.330
This man just lost
the love of his life!

28:59.330 --> 29:02.750
How's he supposed to act?

29:02.750 --> 29:07.210
We need to be there for him,

29:07.210 --> 29:08.830
not ask things of him.

29:10.580 --> 29:12.080
- How are we supposed
to do that?

29:16.670 --> 29:19.170
- I'm sorry you saw us
fighting like that.

29:19.170 --> 29:21.080
You know, it's just
that Scarlett

29:21.080 --> 29:23.500
is very protective of you
'cause you're blood.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.750
And I feel like I have a very
special connection with you too

29:26.750 --> 29:29.080
because of my relationship
with your mom.

29:29.080 --> 29:32.250
- But I don't want you to
feel like you have to help me.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.460
- No, no, no.
Not at all.

29:34.460 --> 29:38.080
What I mean is that every time
I've stumbled in my career,

29:38.080 --> 29:39.920
your mom was
there to pick me up

29:39.920 --> 29:42.540
even when I didn't deserve it.

29:42.540 --> 29:45.750
And I never got the chance
to properly thank her.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.290
Maybe now I can.

29:48.290 --> 29:50.670
I just see so much
potential in you.

29:50.670 --> 29:52.500
And I think the only thing
you need is somebody

29:52.500 --> 29:55.080
who has some serious
experience in this industry.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.750
Someone who's had everything and
the kitchen sink thrown at them

29:57.750 --> 30:01.500
and still come out on top.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.710
I think I know
just the person.

30:03.710 --> 30:05.500
- What are you saying?

30:05.500 --> 30:07.960
- Saying I think Glenn
or somebody else

30:07.960 --> 30:10.330
can handle the boring stuff.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.460
When it comes to guidance,
I want to manage your career.

30:13.460 --> 30:18.960
I want to take you
all the way to the top.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.920
Look, you don't need
to respond right now, okay?

30:20.920 --> 30:23.670
Just think about it.

30:23.670 --> 30:25.790
- Okay.

30:32.420 --> 30:35.000
Hey.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.380
- You okay?

30:38.380 --> 30:41.620
- Not really.

30:41.620 --> 30:44.580
- What's wrong?

30:44.580 --> 30:46.040
- You remember
when Mom used to

30:46.040 --> 30:48.790
just give us advice
about everything?

30:48.790 --> 30:50.920
We'd get so annoyed.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.790
Literally wanted
to rip my hair out.

30:54.790 --> 30:58.960
I could really use
her right now.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.290
- It's okay.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.710
She's still here inside us.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.420
You wanna sing
one of her songs?

32:32.170 --> 32:34.080
- How would you describe
your artistic process?

32:34.080 --> 32:35.580
- Well, let's see.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.290
That's changed a
lot over the years.

32:37.290 --> 32:38.920
If you'd asked me
that 15 years ago,

32:38.920 --> 32:41.790
I would have a very, very
serious answer for you.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.250
And then life happens.

32:43.250 --> 32:44.960
And, you know, now I have

32:44.960 --> 32:46.460
these two girls that
I'm trying to raise up

32:46.460 --> 32:48.710
and I have this
wonderful husband

32:48.710 --> 32:51.620
who I am working with
and writing with.

32:51.620 --> 32:53.750
And, you know,
I'm a very hands-on mom.

32:53.750 --> 32:57.210
So I got the carpool and
we got dinner every night.

32:57.210 --> 33:01.880
So my process becomes whatever
hour I can grab in-between.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.710
It's all about life that
goes into the process.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.880
I guess I could describe
it as organized chaos.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.580

33:57.500 --> 33:59.000
- Hey.
- Thanks.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.040
- Hi.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.710
- I just wanted to help.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.880
- Of course.
Come on back.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.120
- What does it mean
to be making this album

34:13.120 --> 34:16.080
with Deacon about
your life together?

34:16.080 --> 34:17.830
- It means everything.

34:19.710 --> 34:21.500
I could bore you with
all the details

34:21.500 --> 34:23.420
of what brought us
to this moment.

34:23.420 --> 34:26.750
But let me just tell you that
this album and being able

34:26.750 --> 34:30.790
to be married to him and
have him be the father

34:30.790 --> 34:36.670
of my children, finally
after all these years,

34:36.670 --> 34:39.040
we've got a lot
of water under the bridge.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.000
And a lot of history
and I've seen Deacon

34:42.000 --> 34:43.790
go through all of it

34:43.790 --> 34:47.620
and he always comes up
stronger than he was before.

34:47.620 --> 34:50.000
He's just incredible that way.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
He never gives up.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
And now to be able to feel that
strength in my life every day?

34:57.000 --> 35:01.620
And to see him being
that way with our children?

35:01.620 --> 35:06.210
And to know that
he's the best father

35:06.210 --> 35:07.880
that they could ever ask for?

35:09.710 --> 35:14.420
And the best part
about is that I know

35:14.420 --> 35:16.670
he's never gonna
give up on me

35:16.670 --> 35:19.170
or on my girls.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.080
Or on our record

35:24.080 --> 35:26.460
or in any other damn thing
I drag him into.

35:26.460 --> 35:29.620
(laughs)

35:29.620 --> 35:33.460
He's gonna be there.

35:33.460 --> 35:35.120
Pretty lucky.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.460
- Wait, Daph do you hear that?

35:50.460 --> 35:53.080
(music playing)

35:53.080 --> 35:54.880
- Come here, come here.

36:04.710 --> 36:06.960
- Go get your daddy, okay?

36:08.540 --> 36:11.750
- Girls?

36:11.750 --> 36:15.120
Maddie? Daphne?
Where are you?

36:15.120 --> 36:17.250
- Dad!
- Come here.

36:17.250 --> 36:18.460

36:18.460 --> 36:20.120

36:20.120 --> 36:21.880

36:21.880 --> 36:22.880

that I love you?

36:22.880 --> 36:24.420

36:24.420 --> 36:26.380

36:26.380 --> 36:27.790
- We know. Come on.
- Listen.

36:27.790 --> 36:29.290
I got to talk to you guys,
all right?

36:29.290 --> 36:30.750
- No, after.
- Let's sit down and--

36:30.750 --> 36:32.790
- Come on, come on!
- No, no, you have to see this.
