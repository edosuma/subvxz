00:02.077 --> 00:02.835
- Hey, guys! I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

00:02.911 --> 00:04.031
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

00:04.079 --> 00:05.729
Today, we have
a special treat for you.

00:05.731 --> 00:09.174
Since it's Spring Break, instead
of just posting one new video,

00:09.251 --> 00:10.378
we had time to make
lots of videos,

00:10.402 --> 00:11.677
in what we're calling...

00:11.754 --> 00:13.003
(both speaking)

00:17.501 --> 00:19.259
- Wow, that's a mouthful.
- Whew!

00:19.336 --> 00:20.185
Uh, should we come up
with something shorter?

00:20.262 --> 00:22.187
Uh, I was thinking longer.

00:22.264 --> 00:24.431
We've got sketches
and music videos,

00:24.508 --> 00:26.767
and surprise guest stars!

00:26.843 --> 00:27.584
- Like Annie LeBlanc!
- (cheers and applause)

00:27.586 --> 00:28.602
Frankie: Jordyn Jones!

00:28.678 --> 00:30.754
Paige:
And Johnny and Lauren Orlando!

00:30.756 --> 00:31.755
It's Spring Break!

00:31.757 --> 00:32.756
- Yeah!
- Woo!

00:32.758 --> 00:34.925
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:34.927 --> 00:36.777
- Spring Break!
- Spring Break!

00:36.853 --> 00:37.853
Male voice: Bizaardvark!

00:40.949 --> 00:43.691
Do you keep seeing pictures

00:43.769 --> 00:45.860
of yourself pop up
in your social media feed

00:45.938 --> 00:47.880
where you're not tagged?

00:47.956 --> 00:49.100
Here at the law offices
of DeVeene and DeVine

00:49.124 --> 00:50.791
DeVine and DeVeene...

00:50.867 --> 00:53.052
Your untagged days are over!

00:53.128 --> 00:54.256
We were all there, hanging out

00:54.280 --> 00:56.296
in the lounge, me,

00:56.373 --> 00:58.949
Amelia, Horse Face Guy,
Viking Guy.

00:58.951 --> 01:02.227
But when Amelia posted the photo
online... everyone was tagged.

01:04.214 --> 01:05.731
Except me.
Even the couch was tagged.

01:08.961 --> 01:11.070
Was I even there?

01:11.146 --> 01:13.647
Of course you were!
And here at the law offices

01:13.723 --> 01:14.959

Both: Get you tagged!

01:18.804 --> 01:20.971

01:20.973 --> 01:22.489
Done!

01:22.566 --> 01:23.566

01:25.994 --> 01:28.921
I was there! Thank you,

Welcome to

02:57.252 --> 02:59.419
Is Bernie Allowed to Do It?!

02:59.496 --> 03:01.496
My grandson has rules
he has to follow

03:01.573 --> 03:03.089
to live in my house.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.758
So we got three of his friends,

03:04.834 --> 03:06.259
and they're gonna guess

03:06.336 --> 03:08.353
whether Bernie is
or is not allowed

03:08.430 --> 03:10.597
to do various things.

03:10.674 --> 03:12.858
Now let's say hello to Bernie!

03:12.935 --> 03:14.842
(yelling): Bernard!

03:14.920 --> 03:16.645

03:18.924 --> 03:22.092
Yeah!

Amelia? You pick first.

I'll go with "Theme Park Rides"

Uh, I... is it day or nighttime?

03:46.209 --> 03:47.726
Day, duh.

03:47.803 --> 03:50.787

be allowed in the park at all.

04:00.299 --> 04:02.074
Okay. I... I went "yes."

04:02.150 --> 04:03.800
Bernie's a big boy now,
he can handle it.

04:03.802 --> 04:07.404
I also said "yes." I've literally
seen babies on those rides.

04:09.141 --> 04:12.534
Uh, I'm a hard "no."
It goes up, and down.

Yes!

I ate a giant hot dog
right before.

04:24.414 --> 04:26.172
Let's just say
it got real messy.

04:28.251 --> 04:29.268
Because of my throw up.

04:31.497 --> 04:33.588
Frankie, pick a category.

04:33.665 --> 04:35.423
Let's do "Breakfast Foods"
for 100.

Uh, I went with "yes" here.

04:51.683 --> 04:53.016
Uh, pancakes are questionable

04:53.018 --> 04:56.128
because they're big
and a potential choking hazard.

04:56.204 --> 04:57.537
But fruits are good for him.

04:59.282 --> 05:00.690
Uh, I went with "no."

05:00.692 --> 05:02.186
Pancakes are the gateway
to French toast,

05:02.210 --> 05:05.545
and I know Bernie's not allowed
to have foods with corners.

05:05.622 --> 05:10.367
I said "no" if there's syrup,
"yes" if there's not.

using these random foods

06:39.716 --> 06:40.640
as the cookies.

We're gonna taste each one

07:53.957 --> 07:55.957
So we still have a lot more
cookie ingredients,

Oh, no! For unexpected reasons

10:26.201 --> 10:27.292
that have nothing to do

- Untagging?

We don't know what that is.

10:58.216 --> 11:02.160
All right, class, uh, if you
wanna learn more about this,

11:02.237 --> 11:05.905
look it up at home, 'cause Mama's
got a plane ticket to Hawaii.

11:05.982 --> 11:11.895
That's right. Teachers can
do Spring Break, too!

11:11.897 --> 11:14.414
Ugh! I wish the clock would
just hit three already,

11:14.490 --> 11:15.990
so we could be on Spring Break.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.735
I know! It's like it's goin'
super slow on purpose.

11:18.737 --> 11:20.920
Just to be a jerk!

11:20.997 --> 11:23.923
That's nuts. It's not like
the clock is out to get us.

11:26.836 --> 11:30.096
Ah-ha-ha!
Yes, I'm not out to get you.

11:30.173 --> 11:34.851
In fact, I'm going to move
my hand to three right...

11:36.755 --> 11:39.105
Oh, no! It's even earlier!

11:39.182 --> 11:41.107
(students groaning)

11:41.184 --> 11:46.353
Come on, clock! I have a ton of
pool parties I have to go to!

11:46.431 --> 11:48.614
You want to go
to a party, do you?

11:48.691 --> 11:51.376
Where they dance? Like this?

11:51.453 --> 11:54.546
(rhythmically)
Ha cha! Look at my hand!

11:54.622 --> 11:57.999
It's moving backwards.
I hate all your guts!

11:59.627 --> 12:03.704
Come on, clock! My flight
to Maui leaves in an hour!

12:03.782 --> 12:07.726
Yes. A vacation could be cool.

12:07.802 --> 12:11.637
But not as cool as this!
Ah-ha-ha!

12:11.714 --> 12:14.232
I could do this all day!

12:14.309 --> 12:18.236
In fact, I have all the time
in the world! Ha!

12:18.313 --> 12:19.313
Good one, Evil Clock!

12:21.633 --> 12:23.132
Guys! We don't have
to take this abuse,

12:23.134 --> 12:26.486
we can just unplug the clock
and go on Spring Break.

12:28.339 --> 12:30.573
Can just unplug the clock
and go on...

12:32.477 --> 12:35.569
What happened?

12:35.647 --> 12:38.331
You fools. You can't control me,

12:38.407 --> 12:40.425
for I control time!

12:43.488 --> 12:45.880
Why, clock?
Why are you doing this to us?

12:47.842 --> 12:54.013
Perhaps it's because... no matter
how hard I try to keep you here,

12:54.090 --> 12:58.276
you always leave
at the end of the day.

12:58.353 --> 13:00.019
And I'm left here in the dark.

13:01.097 --> 13:03.356
Alone.

13:03.432 --> 13:06.951
(crying)

13:07.028 --> 13:08.620
(bell ringing)

13:08.696 --> 13:10.455
Whoo! Spring Break!

13:10.532 --> 13:11.697
I hate you, clock!

13:11.774 --> 13:16.110
(clock crying)

13:16.187 --> 13:19.130
Wow, Clock. That was a lot
of emotions back there.

13:21.284 --> 13:24.085
You know, I think I might have
an idea on how to cheer you up.

13:27.048 --> 13:31.884
Oh, hey, do you wanna
split an order of hula nachos?

13:31.961 --> 13:33.870
Ooh, those sound great.

13:33.872 --> 13:35.814
Oh, uh, but the kitchen
doesn't open until five.

13:35.890 --> 13:37.056
I can take care of that.

13:39.135 --> 13:40.135
(boing)

13:41.971 --> 13:43.321
(crunching)

13:47.810 --> 13:50.236
Hey, guys! Bizaardvark here
with our friend, Jordyn Jones!

13:50.313 --> 13:52.313
- Say hi!
- Hey, guys!

13:52.390 --> 13:54.223
So what do you normally do
over Spring Break?

13:54.225 --> 13:57.076
Either just swimming
or chillin', watching movies,

13:57.153 --> 13:58.336
hang with friends.

13:58.413 --> 13:59.320
So, I hear you dance.

13:59.397 --> 14:00.897
- Yes. I do.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:00.899 --> 14:02.393
- A great dancer.
- What's your favorite style of dance?

14:02.417 --> 14:03.842
I'd say hip-hop.

14:03.918 --> 14:04.843
- Hip-hop?
- Ooh. Speaking of dancing,

14:04.919 --> 14:06.344
we have a super, super,

14:06.421 --> 14:08.921
super fun challenge that we're
gonna show you right now.

14:08.998 --> 14:12.833
So, we are each gonna pick a little
slip of paper from this hat,

14:12.911 --> 14:16.095
and then we're gonna make a dance that
combines all of them, I'm so excited.

14:16.172 --> 14:16.913
- Are you guys ready?
- All right. Yes!

14:16.915 --> 14:18.672
Yeah. Surfing!

14:18.750 --> 14:20.270
Paige and Frankie:
Surfing! Volleyball!

14:20.343 --> 14:21.395
- Whoo!
- Mine is taking pictures.

14:21.419 --> 14:22.843
- We can do that.
- Oh! Okay!

14:22.921 --> 14:26.680
We can just, like, each stand
and make a line, - Okay.

14:26.758 --> 14:30.017
And then, like, fake surf,
like, whoo!

14:30.095 --> 14:32.686
- Roll, roll...
- Oh my gosh!

14:32.764 --> 14:34.742
- Roll, roll...
- Oh, wow! We're really rollin', okay!

14:34.766 --> 14:36.690
(laughs)

14:36.768 --> 14:38.245
- Rollin'?
- Now that we're done with the surfing...

14:38.269 --> 14:41.212
Okay. -Part right here,
we're gonna move on to the...

14:41.289 --> 14:42.750
- Paige and Jordyn: Volleyball.
- Yeah. Do you wanna do, like a high-five?

14:42.774 --> 14:44.509
Like, we're, like, setting
it, and then we, like...

14:44.533 --> 14:45.533
Okay. Okay.

14:46.628 --> 14:47.534
High-five! Okay!

14:47.612 --> 14:49.703
Then you guys do,
uh, four poses.

14:49.781 --> 14:51.538
We'll pose. Okay.

14:51.616 --> 14:54.634
- One, two, three, four.
- Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose.

14:54.710 --> 14:56.728
We should, like, end it
in a selfie.

14:56.804 --> 14:58.638
- Yay! We did it!
- Ha-ha! Woo-hoo!

14:58.714 --> 15:00.790
- I'm proud of you both!
- Yes, woo!

15:00.792 --> 15:02.125
Introducing our...

15:02.127 --> 15:04.810
(all shouting)

15:04.887 --> 15:08.564
(dance music playing)

15:21.479 --> 15:22.919
That was so much fun,
we had a blast!

15:22.981 --> 15:24.480
- Thank you!
- Thank you so much for coming, Jordan.

15:24.482 --> 15:26.758
- It was so much fun.
- All: Whoa! Woo!

Find out if Bernie
is allowed to...

15:37.920 --> 15:39.771

15:39.847 --> 15:42.331
- (bell dings)
- Correct!

15:42.333 --> 15:44.350
- Use blue toothpaste?
- I'd like to buy a vowel.

15:44.427 --> 15:48.838
(buzzer) - What is, "I'd
like to buy a vowel"?

15:48.840 --> 15:51.265
- (buzzer)
- No vowels!

15:51.342 --> 15:52.933
Enjoy life?

15:53.011 --> 15:55.011
Yeah. That's a hard "no."

15:55.013 --> 15:56.013
(bell dings)

15:59.350 --> 16:01.851
- Do you ever find yourself... -(Bernie's
voice): In need of a handsome agent?

16:01.853 --> 16:04.423
Well, here at... -(Bernie's voice):

have nothin' to do with Bernie Schotz,

16:16.125 --> 16:18.551
I... -(Bernie's voice):
Want my new agent to be...

16:18.627 --> 16:19.627
Amelia: Bernie Schotz!

16:21.706 --> 16:23.815

Call Bernie Schotz... right now!

16:26.469 --> 16:27.643
We're on it!

16:29.397 --> 16:30.438
Yeah!

16:35.570 --> 16:37.811
Hey, guys! Bizaardvark
here with our friends,

16:37.889 --> 16:40.389
Bernie and Amelia,
and our special friends,

16:40.391 --> 16:42.316
- Johnny and Lauren Orlando!
- Both: Hey!

16:42.393 --> 16:44.318
Wait! We're not
your special friends?

16:44.395 --> 16:48.006
- Hey, you're special to us.
- Thanks, man!

16:48.082 --> 16:49.468
Today, we're gonna play
snorkel telephone.

16:49.492 --> 16:50.544
It's like regular telephone,

16:50.568 --> 16:52.401
but with snorkels.

16:52.403 --> 16:54.048
I'm gonna say a sentence
to the person next to me,

16:54.072 --> 16:57.181
and they're gonna repeat it down
the line until the last person

16:57.258 --> 16:58.665
- says it out loud.
- Let's do this!

16:58.743 --> 17:00.184
- (whooping)
- Yeah!

17:00.261 --> 17:02.002
All right?
Here I go... okay, ready?

17:02.080 --> 17:06.599
(Paige speaking)

17:06.675 --> 17:07.767
I don't know.

17:16.185 --> 17:19.186
(Johnny speaking)

17:19.264 --> 17:23.023

- (Amelia speaking)

17:23.101 --> 17:24.691
(buzzer)

17:24.769 --> 17:26.377
I accidentally
ate a freight train?

17:26.454 --> 17:29.121
- (laughter)
- What?

17:29.198 --> 17:32.550
No! It was "I accidentally
ate my sunscreen."

17:32.627 --> 17:34.443
- That's what I heard!
- Others: Ohh!

17:34.445 --> 17:37.613
That was so much fun. We learned
that Bernie is an awful listener.

17:37.615 --> 17:39.373
- Yes.
- No, no, whatever.

17:39.450 --> 17:42.209
Thank you so much to Johnny and
Lauren Orlando for coming!

17:42.287 --> 17:43.636
Thank you for having us.

17:43.712 --> 17:44.856
Happy Spring Break, everybody!

17:44.880 --> 17:46.564
(all whooping)

17:51.296 --> 17:53.720
Male announcer: You are about
to enter the courtroom

17:53.798 --> 17:55.981
of Judge Amelia Duckworth.

17:56.058 --> 17:58.968
The people are real.
The cases are ridiculous.

17:58.970 --> 18:03.397
The rulings are not legally
binding in any way.

18:03.474 --> 18:04.474
This is Judge-Y Amelia.

18:07.829 --> 18:09.411
Order in the court, y'all!

18:10.998 --> 18:15.259
Today's plaintiff
is Scott "Viking Guy" Thompson.

18:15.336 --> 18:16.480
An adult man who thinks
he's a Viking,

18:16.504 --> 18:18.930
despite growing up
in the suburbs

18:19.006 --> 18:21.006
and being born in 1980.

18:23.328 --> 18:26.938
The defendant
is Bernard Miriam Schotz.

18:27.014 --> 18:29.515
(laughs) Wait.
His middle name is Miriam?

18:29.592 --> 18:31.925
Seriously?

18:32.003 --> 18:35.446
(clears throat) The plaintiff, Viking
Guy, claims Bernie took his helmet

18:35.523 --> 18:36.772
and won't give it back.

18:43.014 --> 18:46.290
Okay, let's get this over with.
Bailiff, can you swear the parties in?

18:48.019 --> 18:53.297
(clears throat) Do you swear
to tell the blah, blah, blah,

18:53.374 --> 18:54.465
blah, blah, blah, blah?

18:57.528 --> 18:59.137
- Yes?
- Is that a breakfast menu?

19:01.624 --> 19:05.701
Okay, what's this
nonsense about?

19:05.703 --> 19:07.928
- Well, your honor, it all started...
- Hang on!

19:09.707 --> 19:10.890
Robe change!

19:13.227 --> 19:16.312
A sequined robe? I'll allow it.

19:18.049 --> 19:21.884
(sigh) Is this court
stuff almost over?

19:21.886 --> 19:24.403
I haven't even presented
my case yet.

19:24.480 --> 19:29.816
Uh-uh! Bailiff, did...
Did you order the lip?

19:29.894 --> 19:33.078
Because I didn't order any lip!

19:33.155 --> 19:35.164
You're on thin ice, pal!

19:37.235 --> 19:38.417
What's your case?

19:38.494 --> 19:42.571
Yesterday, I put my
Viking helmet on the table

19:42.573 --> 19:45.074
and went to the bathroom,
and when I returned,

19:45.076 --> 19:46.592
this man was wearing it!

19:46.669 --> 19:50.746
Let the record show...
he called me a man.

19:50.748 --> 19:54.767
- (typing)
- Ohh, I'm so bored!

19:54.843 --> 19:56.477
Robe change!

19:58.439 --> 20:03.016
I know, I'm in contempt...
of cute!

20:03.094 --> 20:05.536
Objection! Overruled!

20:08.357 --> 20:10.491
What... What is happening?

20:13.271 --> 20:16.956
Ugh... you're still here?

20:17.032 --> 20:20.218
Did this case get even slightly
interestin' while I was gone?

20:23.448 --> 20:26.724
Fine. You're both guilty!

20:26.801 --> 20:30.010
I sentence you both
to get outta my face!

20:33.124 --> 20:35.307
I found all that very confusing!

20:35.384 --> 20:38.127
If this were Viking court, we'd
simply tie Bernie up with a rope

20:38.129 --> 20:39.886
and throw him off the ship.

20:39.964 --> 20:43.908
If he survived, innocent,
if not, guilty.

20:43.985 --> 20:45.317
It's a very fair system.

20:48.139 --> 20:50.973
It was pretty obvious
the judge was into me.

20:50.975 --> 20:52.083
Yeah.

20:53.478 --> 20:55.644
Yeah!

20:55.646 --> 20:56.646
Yeah!

20:58.149 --> 20:59.149
Yeah.

21:04.338 --> 21:06.672
Hey, guys, if you're
like us, you do stuff.

21:06.749 --> 21:08.432
And when you're done
with said stuff,

21:08.509 --> 21:11.343
you feel you deserve praise and
recognition for having done that stuff.

21:11.420 --> 21:15.940
So keep that in mind when you
watch our latest music video.

21:16.017 --> 21:20.778
Watch out, everybody! 'Cause two talented
individuals just entered the building!

21:20.855 --> 21:23.614
Dat's right! Paige and
Frankie are winning awards

21:23.691 --> 21:24.985

(music gets softer) - Frankie, do
you think we're getting these awards

22:27.996 --> 22:32.499
- for nothing?
- Yeah, maybe. I... I woke up this morning,

22:32.577 --> 22:34.243
and that hand with the trophy
was already there.

22:34.245 --> 22:39.932
It's almost like... everything we do...
participation award.

22:40.008 --> 22:41.152
Well, that could really
mess us up in the future

22:41.176 --> 22:42.654
because we'll become sad
when we realize

22:42.678 --> 22:46.179
we aren't as talented as these
awards led us to believe.

22:46.257 --> 22:49.425

We hope you had a great time,

23:13.375 --> 23:14.116

- Of course.

23:14.118 --> 23:16.543
Wait! It's over?

23:16.621 --> 23:19.212
What about
my Spring Rake sketch?

23:19.290 --> 23:20.617
Oh. Uh, well, there's
a little time left,
