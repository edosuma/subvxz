He's got a job as a lollipop man!
'Course he has.

00:04.238 --> 00:07.717
I'm gay. Of course I know,
you're my best mate.

00:07.718 --> 00:09.877
I like being around you.

00:09.878 --> 00:12.877
So, is there anything going
on between you and Liam, then? No.

00:12.878 --> 00:14.918
I've sort of got a date this Friday.

00:21.278 --> 00:25.278
Well, we've got a full team.

'Tuesday, 19th of November, 1996.

00:39.878 --> 00:42.157
'Sorry I've not written for a while

00:42.158 --> 00:44.517
'but not much is going on,
except life.

00:44.518 --> 00:46.998
'Archie's been struggling
since he came out.

00:49.838 --> 00:53.398
'Most of his old boy mates don't
want anything to do with him.'

00:58.398 --> 01:01.197
'But he's got us.

01:01.198 --> 01:03.357
'And we've got him.

'Izzy and Chop are going strong...'

01:09.358 --> 01:12.557
'Chop's having to get used to Izzy
hanging around boys at college,

01:12.558 --> 01:15.877
but he's not worried.

01:15.878 --> 01:19.878
'It's cool having a couple
who are madly in love around you.

01:19.998 --> 01:22.797
'It shows you that it does exist.

01:22.798 --> 01:26.517
'Chloe is a social phenomenon.

01:26.518 --> 01:29.597
'I've never met someone
so confident.

01:29.598 --> 01:33.157
'She's started hanging out with
a gang of 23-year-olds.

01:33.158 --> 01:35.757
'She was pretty angry with me
about the fight with Amy,

01:35.758 --> 01:39.758
'but she's forgiven me,
because that's what best mates do.'

01:44.918 --> 01:48.918
'As for Finn, he's started going out
with Olivia, who's 24.

01:51.598 --> 01:53.757
'I'd never met her face to face
and to be honest,

01:53.758 --> 01:56.037
'I wanted to keep it that way.

01:56.038 --> 02:00.038
'But, whatever. I'm so not bothered.

02:00.558 --> 02:01.957
'And as for me...

02:01.958 --> 02:03.477
'Liam broke up with Amy

02:03.478 --> 02:06.437

for leaving me in the lurch.

'We never spoke about that kiss.

'It's great to be young and free and
with no-one telling us what to do.'

Does the Pope shit in his own hat
and punch it? Punch what?

02:21.918 --> 02:25.517
The hatful of shit.
What are you talking about?

02:25.518 --> 02:26.957
Oh, just give me the spliff.

02:26.958 --> 02:30.958
Rae! Rae! Get in the car.

02:31.198 --> 02:34.717
Someone'll spot you!
Chill out, Archie boy!

02:34.718 --> 02:38.718

03:37.787 --> 03:40.266
Karim told me everything.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.146
You've been smoking pot.

03:42.147 --> 03:43.906
And don't even try and deny it

03:43.907 --> 03:47.066
because your eyes are bloodshot to
buggery.

03:47.067 --> 03:49.826
So, what? You drink - there's no
difference.

03:49.827 --> 03:53.827
Yeah, well, there is a difference.
Pot is illegal and I'm not a child.

03:54.107 --> 03:56.546
I'M not a child. You're 16, Rae!

03:56.547 --> 03:59.626
You're not even allowed to buy
alcohol, or drive,

03:59.627 --> 04:02.666
or purchase fireworks,
or become an MP.

04:02.667 --> 04:06.466
I want you back by ten from now on.
Every night.

04:06.467 --> 04:07.986
You can't put a curfew on me.

04:07.987 --> 04:09.386
It looks like I just did.

04:09.387 --> 04:12.906
Or do not want me to buy you food
and give you lifts everywhere?

04:12.907 --> 04:16.546
You know, all the stuff you can't do
because you're not an adult.

04:16.547 --> 04:19.507
But... Conversation over.

04:21.707 --> 04:25.707
And don't expect a lift to
Chloe's party tomorrow.

04:31.627 --> 04:35.627
'I don't want a sodding lift! God, I
am sick of being treated like a kid!

04:36.187 --> 04:40.186
'I need to get out of this house.

04:40.187 --> 04:42.746
'I didn't need my mum to get by.

04:42.747 --> 04:44.626
'I'm 16, for God's sake.

04:44.627 --> 04:48.627
'All I needed was the help of an old
friend - Mr BMX Special.'

'Sometimes, it's the small
things in life that feel good -

05:02.107 --> 05:05.506
'the sun on your face,
the wind in your hair...

05:05.507 --> 05:09.507
'Feels like freedom.'

05:14.747 --> 05:18.747
Argh! Bollocks!

05:27.307 --> 05:29.626
Hello. Hiya!

05:29.627 --> 05:32.626
Happy birthday. Thank you.

05:32.627 --> 05:35.986
What is it?

05:35.987 --> 05:39.426
Oh, Babe! Oh!

05:39.427 --> 05:41.786
Oh, it's like we're best mates
or something!

05:41.787 --> 05:45.787
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
Thank you. It's lovely. Chloe?

05:45.947 --> 05:49.947
Thought maybe
you'd like your present.

05:50.467 --> 05:54.426
There you go. Be careful.
Are you ready?

05:54.427 --> 05:58.427
Go on, get on with it!

06:03.467 --> 06:06.786
Oh, my God!

06:06.787 --> 06:10.746
Oh, my God! Thank you! Thank you!

06:10.747 --> 06:12.226
'How was it that Chloe had a dad

06:12.227 --> 06:16.227
'who treated her like she wasn't
still in nappies?

06:16.787 --> 06:18.946
'And all I had was...'

06:18.947 --> 06:22.947
Whose is this bike?

06:29.627 --> 06:33.627
Simmie said something to Archie.
Something mean.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.946
Chop, you play football with them,
can't you say something? Yeah.

06:37.947 --> 06:41.947
Maybe he was just joking,
like, you know, just messing around?

06:42.147 --> 06:46.147
Forget about it. It's fine.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.746
'Oh, God. No!'

06:50.747 --> 06:54.746
You all right? Yeah.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.226
There we go. All right?
All right? Hiya.

06:58.227 --> 06:59.586
Do you want a drink, girl?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.506
'Girl? I thought I was a girl.'

07:01.507 --> 07:03.186
I'll have a Baileys and ice, please.

07:03.187 --> 07:05.146
'Look at her.

07:05.147 --> 07:06.626
'Just because she's 24,

07:06.627 --> 07:10.026
'she thinks she's more sophisticated
than the rest of us,

07:10.027 --> 07:12.866
'just because she drinks Bailey's.'

07:12.867 --> 07:15.226
Rae, do you want
another snakebite and black?

07:15.227 --> 07:18.026
Yeah. No!

07:18.027 --> 07:21.226
No, I'll have a sherry, please.

07:21.227 --> 07:23.666
A sherry? Hm. OK.

07:23.667 --> 07:27.667
So, you're Rae?
Finn has told me so much about you.

07:29.267 --> 07:33.267
Back in a sec. OK, little bug.

07:33.427 --> 07:36.826
'Little bug? What the fuck?!

07:36.827 --> 07:40.827
'I literally cannot watch this.'

07:42.747 --> 07:46.747
Oh, bollocks, I've just remembered
I've got a thing with a pigeon.

07:49.467 --> 07:53.467
I mean... race.

07:53.907 --> 07:57.907
I've got to go.

08:04.307 --> 08:07.786
'Little bug?
What does that even mean?

08:07.787 --> 08:09.906
'So what if she was 24, beautiful,

08:09.907 --> 08:12.906
had her own flat, swanky job,
her own car.

08:12.907 --> 08:14.626
'I may as well be nine years old,

08:14.627 --> 08:18.066
'sitting in a boy's bedroom
playing computer games.

08:18.067 --> 08:20.986
'I bet Olivia doesn't play
computer games.

08:20.987 --> 08:24.267
'She's far too busy being grown-up
and seducing her man.'

08:28.027 --> 08:32.027
Whoa, there! What are you doing?

08:32.746 --> 08:36.746
Did you not like it?
No, I liked it, but it's just...

08:38.386 --> 08:41.586
I don't want a girlfriend.
Maybe I don't want a boyfriend.

08:41.587 --> 08:44.746
What?

08:44.747 --> 08:47.626
Are you hinting that we should have a
casual relationship, Rae?

08:47.627 --> 08:48.906
Maybe.

08:48.907 --> 08:51.386
Do you not like me, or something?

08:51.387 --> 08:53.426
No, I like you,

08:53.427 --> 08:56.986
but you're not the type of person
to have a casual relationship.

08:56.987 --> 09:00.786
You're not ready for that.
You're too... Too what?

09:00.787 --> 09:02.466
..young.

09:02.467 --> 09:03.986
Thanks!

09:03.987 --> 09:06.986
Young in terms of experience.

09:06.987 --> 09:09.666
Great. Fine. Thanks.

09:09.667 --> 09:13.667
'Sometimes I felt like the world was
conspiring against me.'

09:13.707 --> 09:16.866
Rae?

09:16.867 --> 09:20.867
What are you doing? Nice wheels.

09:30.067 --> 09:33.026
That's when I realised that my mum
and Liam were right.

09:33.027 --> 09:37.027
I was a bloody kid...
and it had to stop.

09:40.627 --> 09:42.386
Anything pink had to go.

09:42.387 --> 09:45.106
Anything with glitter on it
had to go.

09:45.107 --> 09:49.107
Anything that resembled a Troll or
a fairy or a cartoon animal

09:49.947 --> 09:52.707
or had a heart on it, it had to go.

09:57.427 --> 10:01.306
I've been clearing out a load of old
junk to make way for my new stuff.

10:01.307 --> 10:04.186
Any complaints can be
made in writing

10:04.187 --> 10:08.187
and will be processed through the
usual channels, AKA the dustbin.

10:12.747 --> 10:15.146
'So maybe it was going to take
more than a sherry

10:15.147 --> 10:17.626
'and a bin bag full of glitter pens
and Trolls.

10:17.627 --> 10:21.186
'I needed to find another way to
show the world I WAS an adult,

10:21.187 --> 10:24.622
'to show my mum
I wasn't a kid any more.'

10:58.358 --> 11:02.358
Is that Dad?

11:04.654 --> 11:08.654
Yeah, that's your dad.

11:10.454 --> 11:13.773
Does he live local?

11:13.774 --> 11:16.533
He lives in Lincolnshire, yeah.

11:16.534 --> 11:20.333
I want his address.

11:20.334 --> 11:22.093
No.

11:22.094 --> 11:24.773
I want to write to him. No, he...

11:24.774 --> 11:27.093
Mum...

11:27.094 --> 11:31.094
..I'm 16.

11:32.574 --> 11:35.893
I'll think about it.

11:35.894 --> 11:39.894
'The funny thing was, I didn't even
know if I would write to him.

11:40.334 --> 11:44.334
'But maybe he'd treat me
like an adult.'

11:46.574 --> 11:50.574
I've, um...
I've got a scan on Monday.

11:51.174 --> 11:55.053
Karim's starting his evening shift
so he can't come.

11:55.054 --> 11:58.333
I just want someone to be there.

11:58.334 --> 12:00.693
I don't feel very well.

12:00.694 --> 12:03.213
I'm just a little bit worried.

12:03.214 --> 12:04.813
Will you come with me?

12:04.814 --> 12:06.653
Yeah.

12:06.654 --> 12:10.654
'course I will.

12:17.694 --> 12:20.293
I'm sorry, Rae, but you have
to do an assessed performance

12:20.294 --> 12:21.533
or you won't pass this year.

12:21.534 --> 12:24.573
You either involve yourself
in the choir project,

12:24.574 --> 12:26.333
or you can become a prostitute,

12:26.334 --> 12:29.053
in the boys' stage adaptation
of Scarface.

12:29.054 --> 12:31.733
It's up to you.

12:31.734 --> 12:32.933
So I think a cappella.

12:32.934 --> 12:35.173
We've still not decided what
song we're going to do.

12:35.174 --> 12:37.333
We could easily add another
part in for you. No.

12:37.334 --> 12:40.013
No, I'll just, erm,
print stuff off, make drinks...

12:40.014 --> 12:42.813
Chloe, listen to this.

12:42.814 --> 12:44.773
One, two, three...

12:44.774 --> 12:48.774
# Stay with me

12:52.054 --> 12:56.054
# Stay with me

12:56.694 --> 12:59.813
# E-e-e-e-e. #

12:59.814 --> 13:01.173
It's great.

13:01.174 --> 13:04.733
I mean, it needs a little bit
of work, but it is great, isn't it?

13:04.734 --> 13:06.933
Yeah!

13:06.934 --> 13:09.773
Oh, by the way, I'm going to West
Paddock Fair tonight with the boys,

13:09.774 --> 13:11.613
if you fancy it. "Boys"?

13:11.614 --> 13:13.613
Well...

13:13.614 --> 13:15.093
Men.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.493
No.

13:16.494 --> 13:18.933
No, I can't.
I said I'd go with the gang, so...

13:18.934 --> 13:22.934
So, I saw you with your bite
the other night and, well...

13:23.014 --> 13:24.493
Well, what?

13:24.494 --> 13:27.214
Chloe!

13:50.494 --> 13:52.733
All right, this is Ian.

13:52.734 --> 13:56.013
That's Ben, that's Joe, and this...

13:56.014 --> 14:00.014
This is Saul.

14:00.174 --> 14:03.173
You look nice.

14:03.174 --> 14:04.813
What?

14:04.814 --> 14:08.814
You look nice.

14:08.934 --> 14:12.253
Thanks. So Chloe says
that you're a big muso.

14:12.254 --> 14:14.333
What, you like Led Zep?

14:14.334 --> 14:17.693
Does the Pope shit in a hat
and punch it?

14:17.694 --> 14:19.213
He sure does.

14:19.214 --> 14:21.653
You're a pretty cool
customer, aren't you?

14:21.654 --> 14:24.333
Oh, well, it has been said before.

14:24.334 --> 14:28.334
Yeah, I like that.

14:29.174 --> 14:32.453
It doesn't hurt that you're...
very attractive.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.973
Hey, Rae, you coming?

14:34.974 --> 14:38.173
He's going to eat a kebab
and then go on a gravity wheel.

14:38.174 --> 14:41.333
Nothing's going to happen -
my guts are made of titanium.

14:41.334 --> 14:45.334
You can hang out with us,
Rae, if you want.

14:49.654 --> 14:51.533
I'll catch you guys in a bit, yeah?

14:51.534 --> 14:55.534
I'm just going to
keep an eye on Chloe.

15:27.054 --> 15:29.253
No. I'm not getting in that.

15:29.254 --> 15:33.254
Why not? He's fine...
You're fine, Ian, aren't you?

15:35.254 --> 15:37.693
I can walk you if you want, Rae.

15:37.694 --> 15:41.694
That's cool, cos that sorts out
the seating arrangements. Let's go.

15:41.974 --> 15:45.373
Chlo, what you doing?

15:45.374 --> 15:49.374
Don't sweat it.

15:49.534 --> 15:51.933
Shall we?

15:51.934 --> 15:55.934
OK.

16:02.414 --> 16:04.293
'The more pissed I got,

16:04.294 --> 16:05.453
'the more I didn't care

16:05.454 --> 16:08.293
that Saul wasn't exactly
the fittest lad in the world.

16:08.294 --> 16:10.893
'He wanted to hear
what I thought about stuff,

16:10.894 --> 16:12.133
'important stuff.'

16:12.134 --> 16:16.134
D'you smoke? Obviously.

16:17.414 --> 16:20.293
All right, what do you say
we just jump off here then?

16:20.294 --> 16:22.973
Just go to a bar or something?

16:22.974 --> 16:26.373
OK. But just one.

16:26.374 --> 16:29.533
Yeah, just a nightcap. One.

16:29.534 --> 16:33.534
One.

16:44.974 --> 16:48.093
There's something about
staying up until the sun rises

16:48.094 --> 16:49.773
and the birds start cheeping

16:49.774 --> 16:51.813
that is beyond cool.

16:51.814 --> 16:55.253
It's freedom.

16:55.254 --> 16:56.893
Especially when you get back

16:56.894 --> 16:58.973
half an hour before
your mum gets up,

16:58.974 --> 17:02.974
so she'll never find out.

17:06.493 --> 17:10.493
Ooh. Where the bloody hell
have you been?!

17:14.253 --> 17:16.373
Been out with friends.

17:16.374 --> 17:19.532
Friends?

17:19.534 --> 17:21.492
It's six o'clock in the morning.

17:21.493 --> 17:23.613
I've rung everyone.

17:23.614 --> 17:27.532
Chloe, Archie, Izzy -
I've even rung the hospital.

17:27.534 --> 17:29.973
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

17:29.974 --> 17:32.413
No, no, no, it's not
fuckin' all right!

17:32.414 --> 17:35.453
Why didn't you call me?

17:35.454 --> 17:39.454
Why do you never think
about anybody apart from yourself?

17:39.614 --> 17:42.293
Chill out.

17:42.294 --> 17:45.453
There is no need to curse at me.

17:45.454 --> 17:48.773
I've said I'm sorry. I'm 16.

17:48.774 --> 17:51.293
I can do what I want.

17:51.294 --> 17:52.773
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

17:52.774 --> 17:55.573
You're 16, you can do what you want
now, make your own decisions,

17:55.574 --> 17:58.853
like staying out till six o'clock
on a Thursday night.

17:58.854 --> 18:00.653
Whatever.

18:00.654 --> 18:04.654
Don't "whatever" me.
Don't you EVER "whatever" me.

18:05.294 --> 18:08.693
I'm pregnant, in case
you hadn't noticed.

18:08.694 --> 18:11.173
I feel horrible!

18:11.174 --> 18:15.174
I haven't slept all night.

18:16.454 --> 18:20.454
If you want to behave like that,
feel free to move out.

18:21.814 --> 18:24.253
No, I mean it.

18:24.254 --> 18:28.254
You never know, maybe your dad'll
let you live with him.

18:29.134 --> 18:33.134
In fact, you know what...

18:40.574 --> 18:43.213
Here.

18:43.214 --> 18:47.214
You want to write to him,
write to him.

18:47.374 --> 18:50.053
Do me a favour, move in with him.

18:50.054 --> 18:52.413
I've done my shift.

18:52.414 --> 18:54.693
What did you just say to me?

18:54.694 --> 18:57.133
You heard me crystal-clear, love.

18:57.134 --> 19:00.293
I don't want my baby growing up
around someone like you.

19:00.294 --> 19:04.294
Fuck you.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.613
I knew I'd messed up,

19:29.614 --> 19:33.573
but there was no way my mum
should've spoken to me like that.

19:33.574 --> 19:36.533
I bet my dad would never
treat me like this.

19:36.534 --> 19:40.534
And it looks like I was
about to be replaced anyway.

19:47.214 --> 19:49.973
"Dear Dad..."

19:49.974 --> 19:53.293
Problem was that
I knew nothing about him.

19:53.294 --> 19:55.573
I couldn't even
imagine him reading it.

19:55.574 --> 19:57.413
"Dear Victor...

19:57.414 --> 20:01.133
"just wanted to get in touch
and say hi...

20:01.134 --> 20:05.134
"and here's my address.

20:05.174 --> 20:07.693
"Hope to hear from you.

20:07.694 --> 20:11.694
"All the best, Rae."

20:12.414 --> 20:14.573
Usually when I get
a hangover like this

20:14.574 --> 20:17.613
I get the demons
whispering into my ears,

20:17.614 --> 20:19.493
but today it was the opposite,

20:19.494 --> 20:22.813
things were more clear now
than they'd ever been.

20:22.814 --> 20:25.613
I was waiting for people
to treat me like an adult,

20:25.614 --> 20:28.734
so it was time
to make adult decisions.

20:47.454 --> 20:51.454
'This was such a bad idea.'

20:52.494 --> 20:56.494
Can I help you?

20:57.654 --> 20:59.373
I, erm...

20:59.374 --> 21:01.752
Hello.

21:03.294 --> 21:07.294
Hiya.

21:10.494 --> 21:12.140
Rachel.

21:25.814 --> 21:28.293
I like your lamp.

21:28.294 --> 21:30.053
Oh, thanks.

21:30.054 --> 21:32.253
I work in antiques.

21:32.254 --> 21:36.254
It's, erm, '20s Art Deco.

21:37.694 --> 21:41.694
Do you want to borrow anything? Oh,
I don't have a record player. What?

21:42.654 --> 21:45.053
You've got to have a record player!

21:45.054 --> 21:47.853
I mean, the sound
quality is just pfff!

21:47.854 --> 21:51.854
I'll ask for one for my birthday
but I doubt I'll get it.

21:53.294 --> 21:57.294
When... when is your birthday?

21:57.534 --> 22:01.534
Three weeks.

22:05.174 --> 22:08.733
Look, this is so, erm...

22:08.734 --> 22:12.734
I don't know, I should have
rung. Are you angry with me?

22:17.414 --> 22:20.813
Just wanted to come and see you,

22:20.814 --> 22:24.814
meet you.

22:26.494 --> 22:30.494
If you need anything, just say it.

22:31.054 --> 22:35.054
Well, you could give me a
lift home after this brew.

22:37.894 --> 22:40.973
Got a good group of friends?

22:40.974 --> 22:42.613
Yeah.

22:42.614 --> 22:44.653
The best!

22:44.654 --> 22:46.933
So, what do you get up to?

22:46.934 --> 22:50.293
Go to the pub, drive
around. What, you drive?

22:50.294 --> 22:52.493
No, I'm 16.

22:52.494 --> 22:55.493
But your birthday's coming up soon,
you want to get in lots of practice.

22:55.494 --> 22:57.493
Make sure you pass
your test first time.

22:57.494 --> 23:01.373
Nar, my mum would never take me out.

23:01.374 --> 23:03.853
Oh...

23:03.854 --> 23:07.854
Right! What?

23:08.454 --> 23:12.454
What? You'll see.

23:13.014 --> 23:17.014
Trust me, you'll love it.

23:18.254 --> 23:22.254
Oh, my God! It's going to explode!
Press a little lighter, slowly.

23:22.894 --> 23:24.533
Go on.

23:24.534 --> 23:26.053
There you go, you're off!

23:26.054 --> 23:27.533
Go on, Mrs Mansell.

23:27.534 --> 23:29.414
I'm driving, I'm actually driving!

23:34.694 --> 23:38.694
Can we go really fast?

23:42.254 --> 23:46.254
So, what next?

23:50.174 --> 23:54.174
I am angry at you...

23:54.534 --> 23:58.493
..really angry.

23:58.494 --> 24:00.733
Me and your mum...

24:00.734 --> 24:04.733
if you can think of the worst matched
couple in the world, that was us.

24:04.734 --> 24:07.373
Look, you don't have to... No, I do.

24:07.374 --> 24:11.374
I wanted to get in touch with
you, I thought about you...

24:13.054 --> 24:17.054
..but I felt... I was
ashamed of myself.

24:21.334 --> 24:25.334
Now, look, I'm not the
person you think I am.

24:26.654 --> 24:30.654
And I can prove it.

24:33.294 --> 24:36.013
No.

24:36.014 --> 24:40.014
If you want to stay in
touch, then you ring me.

24:41.134 --> 24:45.134
Call before five, my mum's at work.

24:45.214 --> 24:46.773
I will.

24:46.774 --> 24:50.774
Yeah, well, we'll see won't we?

24:51.094 --> 24:55.094
See you.

24:58.454 --> 25:02.093
I knew that he probably wouldn't
ring but I could handle it!

25:02.094 --> 25:04.653
I could handle all
the men in my life!

25:04.654 --> 25:06.293
You look lively!

25:06.294 --> 25:10.294
I had a late night, I was
out with someone. With who?

25:10.894 --> 25:12.933
Just someone.

25:12.934 --> 25:15.013
He's 23, you won't know him.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.733
Does he have a name?

25:16.734 --> 25:20.734
No, he wasn't christened when he was
born, it's a terrible shame for him.

25:21.894 --> 25:25.894
Look, I've been thinking about
our conversation the other day.

25:27.334 --> 25:31.334
If you're cool with
casual, then I am. Right.

25:32.774 --> 25:34.293
So, how about it?

25:34.294 --> 25:36.893
Why don't you come over tomorrow?

25:36.894 --> 25:39.173
We can hang out, as it were.

25:39.174 --> 25:41.693
I'm busy tomorrow,

25:41.694 --> 25:44.213
I've got a party in Uffington.

25:44.214 --> 25:46.493
With, erm, the nameless man?

25:46.494 --> 25:50.494
He'll probably be there, yeah.

25:51.254 --> 25:55.254
Cool, well... have a good time.

25:56.574 --> 26:00.574
Thanks.

26:01.494 --> 26:04.653
I wasn't lying to Liam,
Saul had invited me

26:04.654 --> 26:07.293
and Chloe to some
random guy's party.

26:07.294 --> 26:09.053
That was my life now.

26:09.054 --> 26:11.933
I didn't know where I'd
be from one day to the next

26:11.934 --> 26:15.934
and I also had two men interested
in whistling through my wheat field.

26:16.454 --> 26:20.454
I was, obviously,
doing something right.

26:25.294 --> 26:28.533
Me and Olivia split up.

26:28.534 --> 26:32.534
Yes! In your face,
Miss Baileys and ice!

26:35.174 --> 26:39.174
Sorry, mate.

26:39.454 --> 26:42.333
I guess, we just weren't
right for each other.

26:42.334 --> 26:46.334
She had a mortgage. I don't even
have an overdraft, for fuck's sake!

26:48.214 --> 26:52.214
Is there anything I can do?

26:55.574 --> 26:58.133
It's not just...

26:58.134 --> 27:00.173
What?

27:00.174 --> 27:04.174
I'm not just down about
breaking up with Olivia,

27:04.694 --> 27:07.533
I'm miserable in general.

27:07.534 --> 27:10.173
I don't enjoy college, I never have.

27:10.174 --> 27:12.733
I'm only there because
everybody else is.

27:12.734 --> 27:16.013
So, what are you going to do?

27:16.014 --> 27:19.253
My uncle's got this
scaffolding company in Leeds.

27:19.254 --> 27:22.333
He said I could go up
there and work with him.

27:22.334 --> 27:26.334
It's not exactly the dream but...

27:26.894 --> 27:30.894
Well, we've got to leave
college at some point.

27:32.494 --> 27:36.494
Got to grow up,
eventually, haven't we?

27:38.214 --> 27:42.214
So, you'd have to move?

27:43.814 --> 27:46.213
That's what I'm saying.

27:46.214 --> 27:50.214
I'm thinking about moving away.

27:54.134 --> 27:58.134
Cos I've got no
other reason to stay.

27:58.534 --> 28:02.534
Have I?

28:08.094 --> 28:09.893
Oh, shit!

28:09.894 --> 28:13.493
I've got to go, I've got to
be in Uffington for seven.

28:13.494 --> 28:17.373
Right.

28:17.374 --> 28:21.374
We'll chat more about this later,
yeah? To be continued...

28:25.694 --> 28:27.734
To be continued.

28:45.494 --> 28:48.813
This is how adults did it.

28:48.814 --> 28:52.453
No parents,

28:52.454 --> 28:56.413
no curfews,

28:56.414 --> 29:00.414
no rules.

29:03.214 --> 29:07.214
Rae, I knew you'd make it!

29:07.574 --> 29:09.453
Told you she'd be here.

29:09.454 --> 29:11.653
Saul was getting all worried.

29:11.654 --> 29:15.654
There she is, look, dirty
stop out! You all right, Rae?

29:18.134 --> 29:21.293
Yeah, I'm pretty all right.

29:21.294 --> 29:24.253
Come on then, people,
let's fucking have!

29:24.254 --> 29:25.534
Woo-ooh!

31:09.374 --> 31:12.933
Jesus!

31:12.934 --> 31:16.934
You scared me.

31:20.294 --> 31:23.493
You've got a sexy ass!

31:23.494 --> 31:26.013
Has anyone ever told you that?

31:26.014 --> 31:27.373
Yeah...

31:27.374 --> 31:28.933
I get it all the time.

31:28.934 --> 31:30.933
12, 13 times a day...

31:30.934 --> 31:34.934
I'm sick of hearing
it, to be honest!

31:36.054 --> 31:37.973
Hey!

31:37.974 --> 31:41.773
Right... I knew it, fleshy.

31:41.774 --> 31:45.773
God, I've always wanted
a piece of a larger lady!

31:45.774 --> 31:49.774
Why don't you go and get us
some drinks or something?

31:50.294 --> 31:53.173
I don't want a drink,
I just want to drink you.

31:53.174 --> 31:57.174
Oh, smooth.

31:59.014 --> 32:02.253
Stop it! I don't feel good.

32:02.254 --> 32:06.254
Saul, get off me! You're hurting me!

32:13.334 --> 32:17.334
Don't pretend like
you don't love it.

32:17.414 --> 32:19.413
You should be loving it,

32:19.414 --> 32:23.414
it's not like you've got guys
banging the door down, is it?

32:25.814 --> 32:29.814
Look how hard I am for you!

32:31.374 --> 32:35.374
Eh? Cos you know what you're
doing to me, don't you?

32:35.814 --> 32:39.013
Stop being so frigid!

32:39.014 --> 32:42.613
Just touch me... a little.

32:42.614 --> 32:46.614
Come on, we don't have to do
anything serious... just touch me.

32:46.894 --> 32:50.894
No, no, please. Why not, I can't...

32:57.814 --> 33:00.053
If you put another finger on me,

33:00.054 --> 33:04.054
I will scream this fucking
house down, I swear to God!

33:09.934 --> 33:13.934
Chlo!

33:14.574 --> 33:18.574
Chloe!

33:23.294 --> 33:26.933
Chloe!

33:26.934 --> 33:29.333
Come on, Chloe,
we've got to go! Why?

33:29.334 --> 33:31.693
Saul just tried it on
with me in the toilet.

33:31.694 --> 33:33.573
That's what happened.

33:33.574 --> 33:36.333
Chloe, I said I didn't want
to and then I had to run out,

33:36.334 --> 33:37.653
it was horrible!

33:37.654 --> 33:40.773
Will you please just get your
things? Rae, are you deaf? I'm fine.

33:40.774 --> 33:44.453
I'm not coming. Listen
to your friend, Rae.

33:44.454 --> 33:48.454
Chloe, please, I'm not feeling good.

33:51.934 --> 33:55.934
Fine!

33:59.414 --> 34:01.453
Rae...

34:01.454 --> 34:03.173
Can I come in?

34:03.174 --> 34:07.174
Yeah, yeah, of course.

34:10.813 --> 34:14.013
So, what's going on?

34:14.014 --> 34:17.893
I was in the neighbourhood.

34:17.893 --> 34:21.893
Well, I was 20 minutes away.

34:23.254 --> 34:27.254
I was at a party and this
guy came on pretty strong.

34:27.614 --> 34:29.813
Did anything happen?

34:29.813 --> 34:33.172
No.

34:33.174 --> 34:37.174
No, it was fine... I
got out of there.

34:38.014 --> 34:39.773
But Chloe's still there.

34:39.774 --> 34:41.652
Is she in trouble?

34:41.654 --> 34:45.654
No, erm, no, no-one's in trouble.

34:46.974 --> 34:50.453
It was just horrible!

34:50.454 --> 34:54.454
I'm just fed up feeling horrible!
Is everything all right?

34:57.414 --> 35:00.613
Rae, this is Carrie.

35:00.614 --> 35:04.013
Hiya.

35:04.014 --> 35:08.014
I'll just leave you to it.

35:10.054 --> 35:12.493
Well, she seems nice.

35:12.494 --> 35:15.613
Yeah.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.614
Look, erm, why don't we call your
mum and get her to pick you up.

35:20.934 --> 35:24.934
Yeah? And we can talk about this
next week, when you come in.

36:07.334 --> 36:10.733
I'm sorry!

36:10.734 --> 36:14.734
I know I messed up,
I won't do it again.

36:17.774 --> 36:21.774
Please don't be angry with me.

36:24.254 --> 36:26.242
Are we still on for
the scan on Monday?

36:52.214 --> 36:56.214
Rae.

36:56.974 --> 37:00.974
Archie, what's going on?
Where were you last night?

37:03.254 --> 37:07.254
Uffington.

37:08.334 --> 37:10.053
What's happened?

37:10.054 --> 37:13.813
Kicked off. Big time.

37:13.814 --> 37:15.693
I knew it was going to be
one of those nights

37:15.694 --> 37:17.133
because it was a full moon.

37:17.134 --> 37:19.534
You know how people go
crazy on a full moon?

37:34.334 --> 37:37.893
It was the only time we've
ever kissed.

37:37.894 --> 37:39.973
I didn't even mean it.

37:39.974 --> 37:43.974
Chop's going to be so upset. Don't
tell him. It was a one-off. Great.

37:45.174 --> 37:49.174
Yo, yo! All right, babe.
I'm just going to the loo.

37:49.894 --> 37:52.773
So, we having it tonight or what?

37:52.774 --> 37:56.774
Fucking Amy, I'm going to start with
a cigarette. Who fancies a fag?

37:59.694 --> 38:02.373
Chop, fag?

38:02.374 --> 38:06.374
No? Yeah, I'll have one. Archie?

38:08.654 --> 38:10.173
Fag?

38:10.174 --> 38:11.653
Go fuck yourself.

38:11.654 --> 38:14.773
What was that for?

38:14.774 --> 38:18.774
I was only asking
if you wanted a poof.

38:19.174 --> 38:21.893
You know what the worst thing
is about this?

38:21.894 --> 38:25.894
It's not you two fucking twats.

38:26.574 --> 38:27.893
It's you.

38:27.894 --> 38:30.213
You're supposed to be my mate
and you're sitting there

38:30.214 --> 38:34.214
with your thumb up your ass while
they take the piss out of me.

38:35.614 --> 38:39.413
Archie, wait.

38:39.414 --> 38:42.093
You're a fucking coward.

38:42.094 --> 38:46.094
You deserve everything you get.

38:46.654 --> 38:50.654
He did get everything he deserved.
So has she told him about the kiss?

38:50.774 --> 38:53.333
No.

38:53.334 --> 38:57.334
She couldn't do it.
So she just broke up with him.

38:59.854 --> 39:03.854
Wow. That was awful. OK, we need to
sort everything out tonight.

39:05.374 --> 39:07.853
We need to get the gang together.
What gang?

39:07.854 --> 39:11.854
It's not a gang any more, Rae.

39:27.534 --> 39:31.534
Hello. I was worried your mum might
answer. It's Victor. It's your dad.

39:36.454 --> 39:39.693
Our group has to perform
a couple of groups a cappella.

39:39.694 --> 39:42.133
The thing is no-one knows what
they're doing.

39:42.134 --> 39:46.134
And we haven't even decided on which
songs. You should take charge.

39:46.534 --> 39:50.534
No. I'm only there because no other
group will have me. You know music.

39:52.214 --> 39:56.214
If anyone can save it, you can.

39:58.574 --> 40:02.574
Possible? You're asking me?
I'm asking you.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.133
No. Look...

40:06.134 --> 40:07.453
I've got something for you.

40:07.454 --> 40:11.454
It's a sort of early
birthday present.

40:22.454 --> 40:26.454
What? I kind of owe
you 16 birthday presents.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.413
I love it.

40:30.414 --> 40:32.733
Thank you.

40:32.734 --> 40:33.893
'And there it was.

40:33.894 --> 40:37.894
'Better than a party, better than
car, better than anything.'

40:40.174 --> 40:42.333
Why don't we make this
a regular thing?

40:42.334 --> 40:46.093
You know, every Saturday
afternoon or something?

40:46.094 --> 40:49.413
Yeah, I'd like that. And you know
you can call me any time.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.013
I mean that.

40:51.014 --> 40:55.014
And then maybe we can work up to
telling your mum.

40:57.414 --> 41:01.414
God. Your mum is the most difficult
woman in the world to live with.

41:05.014 --> 41:07.173
What about the quiz shows?

41:07.174 --> 41:11.174
She never was the brightest.
She always was a bit thick.

41:11.374 --> 41:15.213
I'm sorry. I'm not being mean.

41:15.214 --> 41:19.214
It's just that she does like some
stupid things. Doesn't she?

41:20.414 --> 41:24.414
She's a bit dumb sometimes, I guess.

41:26.694 --> 41:29.213
Right,
let's find a song for your show.

41:29.214 --> 41:30.933
# He's a poor boy

41:30.934 --> 41:33.453
# Empty as a pocket

41:33.454 --> 41:36.533
# Empty with a pocket with
nothing to lose

41:36.534 --> 41:38.493
# Sing ta na na
Ta na na

41:38.494 --> 41:40.053
# Ta na na na na

41:40.054 --> 41:44.054
# She's got diamonds
on the soles of her shoes. #

41:44.574 --> 41:47.893
The songs you chose were mint. Why
weren't you singing at the concert?

41:47.894 --> 41:51.453
I told you. I'm just standing in
until Chloe gets back.

41:51.454 --> 41:54.733
That is if Chloe bothers turning up.

41:54.734 --> 41:58.734
Well, speak of the devil.

41:59.854 --> 42:03.333
Sorry I'm late.

42:03.334 --> 42:05.053
What's wrong with you? What?

42:05.054 --> 42:07.413
Aside from the fact that you turn
up to rehearsals late

42:07.414 --> 42:09.413
when your performance
is in five days.

42:09.414 --> 42:12.293
Or is it the fact that you let me
down at the party?

42:12.294 --> 42:14.293
You left me stranded.

42:14.294 --> 42:16.893
I was in trouble and you did
nothing. Babe, I didn't realise.

42:16.894 --> 42:18.253
I was drunk.

42:18.254 --> 42:20.413
I really need to
talk to you about something.

42:20.414 --> 42:22.373
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself?

42:22.374 --> 42:25.973
You're supposed to be my best mate,
Chloe, and you don't give a shit.

42:25.974 --> 42:27.693
I'm not your mum, Rae.

42:27.694 --> 42:31.293
I can't look after you all the time.
What's that supposed to mean?

42:31.294 --> 42:34.173
You're fragile.
You need constant management.

42:34.174 --> 42:36.693
It's not my fault you
act like a kid.

42:36.694 --> 42:40.694
It's not my fault your frigid.
Did Saul say that? Yeah, he did.

42:41.294 --> 42:43.613
And it's true.

42:43.614 --> 42:46.013
Look what happened with you
and Finn.

42:46.014 --> 42:50.014
Don't you ever, ever talk about me
and Finn.

42:50.734 --> 42:54.734
You stay away from me.
I didn't mean it.

42:56.174 --> 42:57.213
Frigid.

42:57.214 --> 42:59.973
Frigid.

42:59.974 --> 43:02.973
'I couldn't let Chloe be right.

43:02.974 --> 43:06.974
'I'm not a kid and I'm not frigid.

43:07.534 --> 43:09.653
'Finn wanted to tell me
something the other day

43:09.654 --> 43:11.413
'and now I wanted to hear it.

43:11.414 --> 43:15.414
'It was time to go and get him.'

43:30.414 --> 43:34.333
'I wasn't a girl any more.
I could handle it.'

43:34.334 --> 43:38.334
Mr Nelson, is Finn at home? He's
gone to Leeds. He left this morning.

43:40.014 --> 43:42.213
Oh, he's gone.

43:42.214 --> 43:46.214
He's going to come back to visit in a
few weeks, maybe. When he's settled.

43:47.374 --> 43:48.414
Thanks.

44:08.174 --> 44:09.853
Hi, this is Vic.

44:09.854 --> 44:12.293
If you're calling
for Artisan Antiques our working

44:12.294 --> 44:14.414
hours are 9-5...

44:28.814 --> 44:31.133
Rae.

44:31.134 --> 44:34.093
Can I come in? What's happened?

44:34.094 --> 44:36.213
Nothing.

44:36.214 --> 44:40.214
Then no, Rae, you can't just
come around whenever you want.

44:42.854 --> 44:46.854
I'm sorry.
It's just not appropriate.

44:46.894 --> 44:50.894
We'll talk about it at our next
session.

44:53.454 --> 44:54.934
Good night, Rae.

45:07.934 --> 45:09.094
Let's have some fun.

45:21.214 --> 45:23.693
What are you doing?

45:23.694 --> 45:27.694
Don't take your clothes off. Neither
of us are oil paintings, are we?

45:28.894 --> 45:32.894
It's probably best
if we just kept our clothes on.

45:35.254 --> 45:38.653
Is that OK?

45:38.654 --> 45:42.654
Yeah.

46:02.574 --> 46:04.035
That was great, thanks.
