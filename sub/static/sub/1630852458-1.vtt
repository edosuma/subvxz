WEBVTT

01:02.228 --> 01:03.646
-Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

01:04.814 --> 01:05.732
<i>Long time.</i>

01:27.504 --> 01:28.630
Ready?

01:28.713 --> 01:29.714
Let's begin!

01:35.220 --> 01:37.889
Uh, begin what exactly?

01:42.143 --> 01:43.937
Begin a new era.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.440
Many of us used to be enemies.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.027
But rivalries

01:52.529 --> 01:54.322
don't need to last forever.

01:54.405 --> 01:57.951
The All Valley Tournament
is just a few months away,

01:58.034 --> 02:01.830
and this year, the stakes are higher
than they've ever been.

02:01.913 --> 02:05.792
We know that Cobra Kai is gonna use
every dirty trick in the book.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.586
There's only one way
we're gonna be able to beat--

02:08.670 --> 02:12.006
By kicking their asses so hard
they shit themselves.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.551
We gotta take things to the next level.

02:17.220 --> 02:21.266
Gonna teach you an aggression stronger
than anything Cobra Kai can throw at us.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.475
They strike first?

02:23.434 --> 02:24.602
We'll pre-strike!

02:24.686 --> 02:28.273
Okay, we're getting ahead of ourselves.
We are going to respond to what they do.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.066
Eagles do not respond.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.485
They swoop down
and take whatever they want.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.155
That's what we're gonna do.
Take back the Valley.

02:35.238 --> 02:39.284
Take it back in a measured
and organized approach.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.243
We bite first!

02:42.704 --> 02:45.623
Okay, let's just warm up
with some simple exercises.

02:45.707 --> 02:46.666
All right, line up!

02:52.380 --> 02:54.007
And just breathe and follow me.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.387
Fighting positions!

02:59.971 --> 03:00.972
Right leg back.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.975
Front kick ready. Hi-yah!

03:04.058 --> 03:05.894
-Shit, dude. I'm sorry.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.314
Ready. Fight!

03:09.397 --> 03:11.024
ENVY SEES ONLY THE GARDEN
WITHOUT THE ROCKS

03:11.107 --> 03:12.400
-Go for the teeth!
-Hey, hey.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.194
You're just swinging at each other.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.070
Don't you teach any defense?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.530
Best defense is more offense.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.157


03:19.240 --> 03:20.074
Holy…

03:20.700 --> 03:21.534


03:21.618 --> 03:23.453
Why do you have a rock in your dojo?

03:23.536 --> 03:24.370
Fight!

03:24.454 --> 03:27.832
<i></i>

03:28.875 --> 03:30.752
That's it. Keep circling.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.879


03:32.962 --> 03:34.130
Don't anticipate.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.673
Stay focused.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.051
One of you do something.
What the hell is this?

03:38.134 --> 03:40.887
That's not how this works.
One of us has to be provoked.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.306
-Ah!
-Hey!

03:43.389 --> 03:44.599
Provoked yet?

03:44.682 --> 03:46.351
Wax on, wax off.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.937
It doesn't matter
how many times you've done it.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.898
You always need
to practice your fundamentals.

03:51.981 --> 03:55.944
That's right, clean it good.
Want it to look brand-spanking-new.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.321
Get all the cans out of there.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.782
You find any loose change,
it belongs to me.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.909


04:04.827 --> 04:07.038
Come on, you maggots! Faster!

04:07.121 --> 04:08.331
Good, good, good!

04:09.290 --> 04:10.625


04:11.125 --> 04:13.378
-Come on, you got this!
-Johnny, come on.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.964
-We're gonna get sued here.
-Uh, sue me for what?

04:16.047 --> 04:18.508
Oh God. I think I'm about to barf.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.928
-Let's go! Move it, move those feet!
-No, no, not the boat!

04:22.011 --> 04:22.929


04:23.012 --> 04:24.138
Not the boat!

04:24.222 --> 04:25.098
Fight!

04:26.808 --> 04:28.601


04:29.269 --> 04:31.562


04:31.646 --> 04:33.564


04:34.857 --> 04:35.775
Oh shit.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.281
You see,
this is why we don't spar in here.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.448
All right, who's next?

04:45.535 --> 04:49.330


04:50.456 --> 04:54.294


04:54.377 --> 04:55.253


04:55.336 --> 04:58.589
Yo, I'm telling you, man,
when I get to ASU,

04:58.673 --> 05:00.883
honeys be lining up for this snack,
know what I mean?

05:00.967 --> 05:01.843


05:02.468 --> 05:04.512
Anyways, my dad,
he wants me to go to Harvard,

05:04.595 --> 05:06.723
but ASU's like
the Harvard of the west coast.

05:06.806 --> 05:10.643
You guys are pathetic. If you'd handled
your business, we would have won.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.603
Okay, whatever. Hawk, he switched sides.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.940
Yeah, Miguel just got out of a wheelchair
and he still kicked your ass.

05:16.024 --> 05:20.028
You know what? At least
I'm still here. Half the squad quit.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.154


05:22.697 --> 05:24.198
Well, look who showed up.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.284


05:28.244 --> 05:32.081
That fool doesn't even practice,
but he gets to stay? I don't get it.

05:37.879 --> 05:38.796
You're late.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.674
I'm not here for practice.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.384
Well, if you wanna be a Cobra Kai--

05:43.468 --> 05:46.721
I never said I was joining.
I just needed a place to crash.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.015
Well, you can crash here
as long as you want.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.105
Look, this was a bad idea.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.692
I know Cobra Kai helped
when I was getting jumped in juvie,

06:00.193 --> 06:03.863
but I am not gonna be a pawn in this bet
you've made with my dad and Mr. LaRusso.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.367
I don't think of you as a pawn.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.578
I think of you as a king.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.833
Your father had all the talent
in the world, but he squandered it.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.669
I gave him every opportunity to come back,

06:20.421 --> 06:21.631
but he chose Diaz.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.343
And he left you
with that mark on your head.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.263
Trust me, you've got
even more talent than your father.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.934
You just need to show it to the world.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.604
After everything,
do you think I care about a stupid trophy?

06:36.687 --> 06:38.022
It's not about the trophy.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.025
It's about being a champion.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.860
Win or lose,

06:42.944 --> 06:46.114
that reputation will follow you
the rest of your life.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.533
Ask your father and LaRusso.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.328
Yeah, well,

06:52.829 --> 06:55.373
they have a good chance of winning
now they've teamed up.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.169
They're not the only ones teaming up.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.470
Oh shit!

07:14.225 --> 07:15.226
-I'm sorry.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.520
I-I'm still getting used to the code.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.689
-This new alarm sucks.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.024
You should've sprung
for the one with facial recognition.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.110
Hi, this is Amanda LaRusso.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.362
Sorry, it was a false alarm.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.531
Uh, password is <i>"Outlander."</i>

07:29.115 --> 07:30.032
Okay.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.872
I'm trapped, Daniel.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.084
I thought the new security system
would make me feel safer,

07:40.168 --> 07:42.211
but it's just putting me more on edge.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.299
Those little Cobra Kai shits
ought to be locked up.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.509
Especially that Tory psycho.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.345
If anyone deserves no mercy, it's her.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.223
If you want to, honey,
we could still go to the police.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.267
We've already been through this.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.436
Sam doesn't need
to go through all this again and our…

07:58.936 --> 08:01.355
business can't survive
another PR nightmare.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.816
I know things are less than ideal.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.236
A small boy was thrown through our window.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.865
Daniel, if you would have told me
a year ago

08:10.948 --> 08:14.243
that our family's safety depended
on winning a karate tournament,

08:14.327 --> 08:15.786
I would have thought you were joking.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.499
Here we are. Living in <i>The Twilight Zone</i>.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.668
Believe me, Amanda,
I want things to go back to normal too.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.881
But if Johnny and I
can just actually work together,

08:26.964 --> 08:29.300
it gives us the best shot
to put an end to all this.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.011
So how did it go with Captain Eagle Claw?

08:32.094 --> 08:34.430
At least we haven't
beat each other up yet.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.349
Oh. Well, progress.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.524
Do you really think Kreese
is gonna shut down Cobra Kai if he loses?

08:44.607 --> 08:45.775
Oh, he's gonna lose.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.653
We got LaRusso 2.0 fighting for us.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.405
And once he loses,
it won't matter if he welches.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.992
Everyone in the Valley will see
that Cobra Kai doesn't work.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.244
Especially Robby.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.796
Dinner is served.

09:06.879 --> 09:10.591
All right, tonight's main course
is fajitas and grilled vegetables.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.426
I have pico de gallo

09:12.510 --> 09:14.804
and corn and flour tortillas.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.599
Wow. This looks delicious, Johnny.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.227
Thanks. I got the recipe
off the Chili's website.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.603
I wanted it to be authentic.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.522
Authentic for who?

09:24.605 --> 09:27.024
We're Ecuadorian not Mexican.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.026
-Mama!
-Here, try this.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.945
Spicy mango.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.406
Just like the old country.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.158
Uh, <i>gracias.</i>

09:36.242 --> 09:38.703
So how was the big first day?

09:38.786 --> 09:40.788
Uh, you know, it's the first day.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.457
Work in progress.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.294
I'm happy
you and Daniel are working together.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.212
I just want to make sure Miggy's safe.

09:48.296 --> 09:51.632
My back's in better shape than ever, okay?
You don't have to worry.

09:51.716 --> 09:56.012
She's your mom, she's always gonna worry.
But don't worry, I'm watching him.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.722
So, <i>mijo,</i> tell me,

09:57.805 --> 10:00.933
how do you like
doing karate with your girlfriend?

10:01.892 --> 10:05.646
You guys enjoy
a lot of one-on-one sparring?

10:06.689 --> 10:09.900
I'm glad you and Sam
are back together. She's cute.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.821
I'm not the only one who's getting
back together with an ex, huh, sensei?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.657
He had a date with the love of his life.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.534
The one that got away?

10:20.411 --> 10:22.038
Is that right?

10:22.622 --> 10:25.207
-It wasn't a date, no.
-He's being modest.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.460
We took those cool pictures
and made you look--

10:27.543 --> 10:29.420
Not to say you didn't look cool already,

10:29.503 --> 10:32.173
but he had to look special
for the special lady.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.382
Tell 'em about the sushi.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.301
-We don't have to talk about it.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.428
I don't know why he's being shy right now.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.389
We went to the sushi spot
because Ali likes sushi, or so we thought.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.725
So we got the dragon roll…

10:50.066 --> 10:51.525
It's not like that, you know?

10:52.109 --> 10:55.029
-We're just old friends catching up.
-Okay.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.287
Carmen, on the night
of what happened at the LaRusso house,

11:04.747 --> 11:06.082
I was coming to see you to--

11:06.165 --> 11:10.836
Johnny, I… think it's better
that we don't rush into anything.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.881
With everything that's happened
and everything still happening,

11:13.964 --> 11:16.342
I think we should give it some time.

11:19.136 --> 11:20.471
Is that okay with you?

11:21.097 --> 11:21.931
Yeah.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.599
Totally.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.936
We'll give it some time.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.141
Whoa, whoa, Carla.
Let me help you.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.059
Here, I got it.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.603
There you go.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.856
Thank you, Mr. Silver.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.068
<i>Come on, say it.</i>

12:16.152 --> 12:19.155
-Say it! Cobra Kai…
-Never dies.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.823
You bet your ass.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.533
What do you want?

12:23.117 --> 12:26.328
I'm not here to cause any trouble.
I just want to catch up.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.914
You know, for old times…

12:30.040 --> 12:30.916
sake.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.919
Uh, excuse me for a second.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.922
Everything okay, babe?

12:40.050 --> 12:42.595
This is John Kreese. An old friend.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.097
Well, any friend of Terrance
is a friend of mine.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.141
Hi, I'm Cheyenne.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.100
Pleasure.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.479
So, Terrance,

12:51.562 --> 12:53.564
you've actually tied the knot, huh?

12:53.647 --> 12:56.025
Oh, no. We're not married.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.069
Terrance and I
are enjoying the journey for now.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.324
So we are just having some hors d'oeuvres.
Would you join us?

13:03.407 --> 13:05.242
-John just--
-Oh, that would be splendid.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.703
Great. How about a mimosa?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.331
How about two?

13:10.414 --> 13:11.290
Ooh.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.214
Ready, bow.

13:19.673 --> 13:23.886
Sensei Lawrence and I have the same goal
of preparing you for the tournament.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.971
But we have different ways
of getting you there.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.850
We realize that teaching you
opposing viewpoints at the same time

13:29.934 --> 13:31.268
can be a little confusing.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.854
So we've discussed it
and come up with a solution.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.481
We're gonna divide and conquer.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.901
Eagle Fang trains out front.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.986
And I'll be back here with the Miyagi-Dos.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.780
I thought we were stronger
working together.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.282
-We're still working together.
-Just separately.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.368
On opposite ends of the dojo.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.370
All right, Eagles, follow me.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.038
Miyagi-Dos, come on over here.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.960
-Later, man.
-See you later.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.381
-I guess I'll see you after class?
-Guess so.

14:04.134 --> 14:04.969
Fall in!

14:08.472 --> 14:11.767
Hawk, since you're new to Eagle Fang,
come on up.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.810
Yes, sensei.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.438
-Hi-yah!

14:17.481 --> 14:18.315
What the heck?

14:18.399 --> 14:21.735
Today we're gonna practice
our front sweeps. On Hawk.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.823
All right.
I know I was a dick, but I'm sorry.

14:25.906 --> 14:26.949
Talk is cheap.

14:27.950 --> 14:28.951
Who's next?

14:29.034 --> 14:30.286
Penis Breath, you're up.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.547
You're supposed to have someone spot you,
you know.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.549
I don't need a spotter.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.349
Looks like you've upgraded
from running away to hiding.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.434
I'm not hiding.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.271
Could've fooled me.
I don't remember seeing you at the fight.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.522
What were you even thinking?

14:58.606 --> 15:00.733
That you'd break into the LaRussos'
and hurt Sam

15:00.816 --> 15:02.735
and everything would be
sunshine and roses?

15:02.818 --> 15:04.737
You're lucky the LaRussos
didn't call the cops.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.739
At least I'm not straddling the fence.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.658
Girls like Sam LaRusso
think the world revolves around them.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.868
And why shouldn't she?

15:11.702 --> 15:15.664
All she has to do to get what she wants
is make a puppy dog face and say please.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.586
Even after she dropped you, she's still
got you wrapped around her finger.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.672
-That is not true.
-Then why are you defending her?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.259
You're right to skip practice.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.138
If you're gonna stay on defense,
this isn't the right dojo for you.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.775
Appetizer?

15:46.570 --> 15:48.781
It's a vegan tofu skewer.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.951
Totally organic. Just, uh,
dip it in the cilantro cashew sauce.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.118
It's to die for.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.829
No, thank you. I'm… just not hungry.

15:57.039 --> 16:00.709
So you and Terrance,
you've known each other for a while?

16:00.793 --> 16:01.627
Fifty years.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.711
We met in 'Nam.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.630
Special Forces.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.383
But you never told me
you were in the military.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.260
There's not much to tell.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.305
Right. Not much.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.727
Something I can help you with, bud?

16:19.478 --> 16:21.730
You have a Habsburg jawline.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.900
I've never seen one quite so perfect.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.448
What nice new friends you have, Terrance.

16:32.199 --> 16:36.578
Terrance was kind enough to host
the launch of my new mindfulness app.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.373
Unfortunately, most of the schools
outside of Los Angeles,

16:39.456 --> 16:40.916
they don't teach mindfulness,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.044
so I figured why not create an app

16:44.128 --> 16:48.716
where kids in places like Ohio,
for example, can learn it for themselves?

16:48.799 --> 16:50.592
Ah, I'm sure kids would love that.

16:51.218 --> 16:55.139
Terrance and I have a history
of teaching children, with martial arts.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.890
Oh, that's right.

16:56.974 --> 17:00.769
You did mention something
about a karate team once. Um…

17:01.353 --> 17:02.604
What was it called again?

17:03.355 --> 17:04.231
The Vipers?

17:06.316 --> 17:09.737
-Cobra Kai.
-That's adorable!

17:09.820 --> 17:12.656
I had no idea you had a karate phase.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.241
Karate is not a phase.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.410
It's a way of life.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.371
You can leave it for a while,

17:21.081 --> 17:22.666
but it never really leaves you.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.795
<i>We all have anger inside.</i>

17:26.879 --> 17:28.630
But I want you to let it go.

17:29.506 --> 17:32.092
Don't let your emotions control you.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.846
You have to be the one in control. Right?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.475
Now, everyone close your eyes

17:40.309 --> 17:41.393
and relax.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.896
Stop whinin' like a little bitch.
Get up.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.606
Stay focused.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.107
Eyes closed.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.318
Breathe in.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.321
Breathe out.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.281
Don't be a pussy.
Punch him in the face.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.451
Try not to be distracted.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.370
Stay focused.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.956
You punched him in the balls?
What the hell is wrong with you?

18:04.583 --> 18:05.542
Wait right here.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.295
-Boom! Nice shot, Gus!

18:08.378 --> 18:10.047
-Right in the gut.
-Sensei Lawrence.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.508
-Yes, sir!
-May I have a word with you?

18:14.051 --> 18:18.639
All right, guys, everybody take five.
Walk it off. Looking good, looking good!

18:21.558 --> 18:23.685
Could you keep it down?
I'm trying to teach.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.106
Keep it down? Do you want me to whisper?
Karate's a loud sport.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.983
I can't train my students
if you're shouting obscenities.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.152
-Obscenities? What kinda bullshit is that?
-Yeah.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.324
"Walk it off"?
I'm trying my best here.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.799
That's the sparring deck

18:53.882 --> 18:58.011
where Mr. Miyagi's great-grandfather
taught karate on the Okinawan waterfront.

19:00.597 --> 19:04.226
-Yo, be careful with that.
-Why, you think I'm gonna break it?

19:04.309 --> 19:05.894
You already broke a door.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.981
-And you stole Mr. Miyagi's medal.
-And you beat the shit out of me.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.151
Hey, look,
I'm really sorry about all that.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.404
Go back with your little Eagle gang.
You're not wanted here.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.914
This was always gonna be a disaster,
wasn't it?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.750
-Everything's a disaster with you.
-What? Me?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.502
-Hey, Mr. LaRusso, can we talk?
-What?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.505
-I don't know where I fit in here.
-What did you expect?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.883
You've burned bridges
with pretty much everyone here.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.012
Hey! Hey!

19:42.764 --> 19:44.683
-What the hell did you do?
-What did I do?

19:44.766 --> 19:46.727
I'm not the one
who's been kicking his ass all day.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.479
We're training for the All Valley,
not some yoga competition.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.815
Don't disrespect my dojo
in front of your students.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.568
Don't tell me how to run my class.
I'll do whatever I want.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.236
-I know what you're doing.
-Yeah?

19:56.320 --> 19:59.114
As long as you're under my roof,
they're both our students.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.909
Oh, yeah, I know.
Under what roof? We're outside.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.036
Look, I tried.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.914
The only thing LaRusso and I
have in common is hating Kreese.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.540
I thought that was enough, but it's not.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.211
There's gotta be a way to make it work.
You guys just have to connect.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.589
Not gonna happen. We're too different.
There's too much history.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.800
Forget it, kid.
We'll take down Cobra Kai on our own.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.638
What about <i>Rocky III</i>?

20:26.433 --> 20:27.434
What about it?

20:27.517 --> 20:29.269
How did Rocky defeat Clubber Lang?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.649
Did he do it alone? No.
He and Apollo had to work together.

20:34.274 --> 20:37.486
Even though they had all that history,
though they're complete opposites,

20:37.569 --> 20:38.403
they made it work.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.781
It was only because
someone had to reach out first.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.282
That was Apollo.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.870
Why can't LaRusso be Apollo?

20:47.537 --> 20:49.331
'Cause striking first is more badass.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.043
I'll think about it.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.764
Hey. So how did it go?

21:05.847 --> 21:08.892
I'm not sure it worked, but we'll see.
What about you?

21:08.976 --> 21:10.936
Couldn't tell
if my dad went for it or not.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.980
<i>Well, we did everything we could.</i>

21:13.063 --> 21:16.191
<i>If this doesn't keep our dojos together,</i>
<i>I don't know what will.</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:17.567
We've gotta try everything.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.030
No matter how difficult it may be.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.909
<i>All right.</i>
-Bye.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.077
<i>Bye, babe.</i>

21:30.122 --> 21:30.956
Robby.

21:42.009 --> 21:45.262
I came here every day after you ran away,
hoping I would find you.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.098
So what do you want?

21:48.682 --> 21:51.685
I was really angry at you
for what happened at the school.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.397
But believe me,
I never stopped caring about you.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.399
Never stopped caring about Miguel either.

21:57.983 --> 21:58.817
I know.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.905
I thought that that was over,
but it was more complicated.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.534
There's nothing complicated about it.
It's a choice and you chose.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.286
You're right.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.748
But that doesn't mean
you have to make the wrong choice.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.666
You're a good person.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.793
My dad knows it. Your dad knows it.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.754
My dad also had a choice,

22:18.837 --> 22:22.632
and he chose to become a drunk loser
who still hasn't figured out his own life.

22:22.716 --> 22:26.428
Now he wants to make up for lost time
so he can feel better about himself?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.597
It's not gonna happen.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.598
Please.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.391
Your dad is trying to change.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.517
Mine is too.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.895
If you could just come back,

22:35.604 --> 22:37.731
you could really help
bring everybody together.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.149
That's all that I want.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.403
Then it looks like I get to be
the first person to ever tell you this.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.990
You're not getting what you want.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.161
Okay.

22:52.662 --> 22:53.580
Just remember,

22:55.123 --> 22:56.375
this was <i>your</i> choice.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.185
Nice view from up here.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.938
I guess you get what you pay for.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.274
Is that what you want, John?

23:22.609 --> 23:23.443
A check?

23:25.737 --> 23:27.739
I wanna finish what we started.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.282
Finish what we started.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.536
Just like we were supposed to do
35 years ago?

23:33.495 --> 23:34.704
Before you vanished?

23:34.788 --> 23:36.206
I was in a bad place.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.959
There's no question about that.

23:39.626 --> 23:40.710
But I'm back now,

23:41.878 --> 23:43.588
and you can be too.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.549
Look around.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.261
I'm doing just fine.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.303
Are you?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.598
Because the Terry Silver that I knew

23:53.682 --> 23:56.143
would have roundhoused
old four-eyes back there

23:56.226 --> 23:59.146
for calling Cobra Kai "adorable."

24:02.357 --> 24:04.484
Do you remember
when we got back from 'Nam?

24:08.530 --> 24:10.866
We went through hell
watching our friends die,

24:11.491 --> 24:15.495
only to be welcomed home
by a bunch of hippies calling us killers.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.624
People needed to learn some respect,

24:20.167 --> 24:21.251
some discipline.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.171
That's why we started Cobra Kai.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.468
Together, we made a difference.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.510
Yeah.

24:32.095 --> 24:33.722
-We did.
-We can do it again.

24:33.805 --> 24:38.018
There's a whole new generation out there
that can use what we know.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.606
The only thing standing in our way
is Daniel LaRusso.

24:43.398 --> 24:44.316
Danny boy?

24:44.399 --> 24:47.986
He's even teamed up with… Johnny Lawrence.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.237
Wait, wait.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.534
Your champ and LaRusso working together?

24:54.618 --> 24:55.911
That's why I'm here.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.162
I need a partner.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.999
And the only other person
who knows how to teach Cobra Kai

25:02.000 --> 25:03.126
is you.

25:04.002 --> 25:04.878
What do you say?

25:11.885 --> 25:13.094
I say

25:14.012 --> 25:14.846
no.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.976
Back in the '80s,

25:21.311 --> 25:22.938
I thought I could conquer the world.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.815
<i>And I came pretty damn close.</i>

25:25.899 --> 25:28.944
<i>I was so hopped up on cocaine</i>

25:29.027 --> 25:29.945
and revenge…

25:31.863 --> 25:32.822
Hi-yah!

25:32.906 --> 25:35.242
…<i>I spent months</i>
<i>terrorizing a teenager</i>

25:35.325 --> 25:37.410
<i>over a high school karate tournament.</i>

25:37.494 --> 25:41.164
It sounds insane just talking about it.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.669
After that tournament, I hit rock bottom.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.755
But I built myself back up.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.550
Got my ass into therapy,

25:52.759 --> 25:54.302
found clarity.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.056
Turns out you disappearing

25:58.890 --> 26:00.725
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

26:04.396 --> 26:07.023
You know, people expect men of our age

26:08.066 --> 26:09.234
to pack it in

26:10.026 --> 26:11.695
and go off into the sunset.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.447
That might work for you.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.786
But I still have some fight left in me.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.667
Please thank Cheyenne for the tofu.

26:39.389 --> 26:42.434
"Hey, Daniel.
I know things have been tense."

26:42.517 --> 26:44.102
"We got off on the wrong foot."

26:45.562 --> 26:48.565
"I'm sorry
for interrupting your class today."

26:50.400 --> 26:52.861
No. Don't apologize. It shows weakness.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.749
Too late for a pop-in?

27:06.958 --> 27:08.043
What do you want?

27:08.126 --> 27:12.005
I know we got off on the wrong foot
and I'm sorry I snapped at you.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.758
Yeah, well, you should be sorry.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.721
Maybe we could hash things out?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.139
Ah.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.270
Ham?

27:28.480 --> 27:32.233
Uh. Uh, n-no. No, I'm, I'm… I'm good.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.111
Suit yourself.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.001
All right, look…

27:51.419 --> 27:52.545
I understand

27:53.171 --> 27:55.757
how difficult it must be
coming to my dojo.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.842
It's no secret we've had our problems.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.054
But I think we can agree
we have to try and make this thing work.

28:01.137 --> 28:03.848
So for the sake of the kids, I think…

28:05.266 --> 28:07.852
that it's time
that you officially join Miyagi-Do.

28:08.770 --> 28:11.356
Wait, what?
Why the hell should I join your dojo?

28:11.439 --> 28:14.901
Because the more we fight with each other,
the harder it is on the kids.

28:14.984 --> 28:17.529
You join Miyagi-Do,
we're all on the same page.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.824
Why do I have to be the one to switch?
Why can't you join Eagle Fang?

28:20.907 --> 28:22.158
Ah, come on, Johnny.

28:22.242 --> 28:25.412
Miyagi-Do has a rich tradition
going back hundreds of years.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.748
You started your dojo,
what, three weeks ago in a park?

28:28.832 --> 28:31.167
I'm pretty sure you came up with the name
from this poster.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.753
Just 'cause something's
been around longer doesn't make it better.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.922
Your dojo doesn't even have
a good place to fight.

28:36.005 --> 28:38.508
You complaining about my dojo?
It's not costing you a thing.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.385
-It's always about money.
-Money?

28:40.468 --> 28:44.180
I haven't mentioned the fact you're
driving a stolen car from one of my lots.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.558
Oh, please, the thing's a piece of shit.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.768
The radio's busted,
the trunk smells like piss.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.604
-You should go in there.
-You know what? Forget it.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.148
I don't know what I was thinkin'.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.650
How is this ever gonna work?

29:04.492 --> 29:05.368
It's not.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.374
If this is final,
we're gonna have to tell the kids.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.668
We'll tell 'em tomorrow.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.297
Rip the Band-Aid off.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.025
Good day, my lady.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.569
My name is Miguel
and I'll be your chauffeur this morning.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.617
As long as, uh,
you can help me hot-wire this thing?

29:48.077 --> 29:50.538
Wow, not even a courtesy laugh?

29:52.707 --> 29:54.417
My dad was gone by the time I woke up.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.711
Know if he had a chance
to connect with Johnny?

29:57.712 --> 29:59.255
I didn't see him this morning either.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.801
What's up, Hawk?

30:04.260 --> 30:05.094
Hawk!

30:07.222 --> 30:08.348
Was that a sledgehammer?

30:13.019 --> 30:14.229
I'm telling you,

30:14.771 --> 30:16.356
that fiesta burrito?

30:16.439 --> 30:18.024
Shit, it was like a party with…

30:19.943 --> 30:22.695
Get a load of this chump.
What are you doing here?

30:22.779 --> 30:25.949
Sensei Kreese isn't back yet,
so I'm gonna get you guys warmed up.

30:26.032 --> 30:29.869
You've never been a part of this team
and you think you're our sensei?

30:30.620 --> 30:33.081
-Get the hell outta here, man.
-Who says we even want you?

30:37.001 --> 30:37.877
Okay, hit me.

30:39.712 --> 30:40.588
Any of you.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.927
If any of you can land a hit, I'll go.

30:46.761 --> 30:47.929
All right.

30:52.725 --> 30:53.726
Who's next?

31:38.605 --> 31:40.064
You just gonna watch?

31:59.125 --> 32:00.460
No hard feelings?

32:09.260 --> 32:10.178
A deal's a deal.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.139
I'll go.

32:15.141 --> 32:16.225
No.

32:18.811 --> 32:19.646
Stay.

32:38.456 --> 32:39.624
Light traffic today?

32:39.707 --> 32:41.334
What's that supposed to mean?

32:42.043 --> 32:44.337
Nothing, I'm just surprised
you got here on time.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.630
Why wouldn't I be?

32:47.465 --> 32:49.133
Sooner we get this over with, the better.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.303
Whatever. Let's just get on the same page
on how we're gonna break it to 'em.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.141
All right, stand back. It's comin' down!

32:58.643 --> 33:00.144
Hey! What are you doin'?

33:03.398 --> 33:06.067
You were both right. Talk is cheap.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.486
So I'm building a bridge.

33:08.569 --> 33:12.115
Uh, more specifically,
an Okinawan sparring deck.

33:12.740 --> 33:16.244
Eli's a design whiz. I looked it over
and the physics check out.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.788
Mr. Miyagi just used this area
for extra storage,

33:18.871 --> 33:21.332
but a new deck would mean
a lot more room for training.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.919
We're all gonna help build it.
Assuming our senseis approve?

33:36.848 --> 33:37.765
Sounds good to me.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.685
Yeah.

33:41.978 --> 33:42.979
Sounds awesome.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.949
<i>Over at Miyagi-Do,</i>
<i>our enemies are uniting against us.</i>

33:55.700 --> 33:58.578
They think by working together,
they have the advantage.

33:59.454 --> 34:01.164
They think they're better than us.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.501
<i>And I should know</i>
<i>because I used to be one of them.</i>

34:08.546 --> 34:10.381
That officially ends today.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.217
I'll admit,

34:14.260 --> 34:16.387
at first, I didn't want to join Cobra Kai.

34:18.556 --> 34:19.515
But eventually,

34:20.391 --> 34:22.268
<i>we all need</i>
<i>to look ourselves in the mirror</i>

34:22.769 --> 34:24.353
<i>and realize who we really are.</i>

34:24.896 --> 34:29.442
Terrance? Would you be a darling and get
a bottle of Montrachet from your cellar?

34:30.318 --> 34:31.235
Of course.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.531
<i>Now,</i>
<i>we may have taken some losses,</i>

34:36.616 --> 34:38.284
<i>but it's not about how you start.</i>

34:38.868 --> 34:40.495
<i>It's about how you finish.</i>

34:42.288 --> 34:45.792
And to beat the enemy,
it helps to know the enemy's playbook.

34:48.169 --> 34:50.713
So I'm gonna teach you Miyagi-Do karate,

34:52.298 --> 34:55.301
so we can beat Miyagi-Do Karate.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.391
They're warmed up for you, sensei.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.085
Ah-sah!

35:33.923 --> 35:36.259
Terrance, is everything okay?

35:36.843 --> 35:37.718
Yeah.

35:40.471 --> 35:41.305
Coming.
