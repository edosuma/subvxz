Excuse me,
could you um please uh...

00:41.008 --> 00:44.000
Of course!

00:44.002 --> 00:45.006
Why do I bother?

00:45.008 --> 00:47.015
The water always goes
straight through em.

00:47.017 --> 00:50.009
The one thing they don't
tell you about being a ghost

00:50.011 --> 00:52.023
is that your hands
always feel sticky.

00:53.001 --> 00:55.002
Boy am I glad
my hands are alive.

00:55.004 --> 00:57.003
I love to wash them.

00:57.005 --> 01:00.008
I gotta say,
you've got great technique!

01:00.010 --> 01:01.019
Thanks!

01:01.021 --> 01:04.013
There's a big handwashing
community in my hometown.

01:04.015 --> 01:06.014
What's your name young man?

01:06.016 --> 01:08.014
Oscar Peltzer!
What's yours?

01:08.016 --> 01:09.019
Ghost the Ernest.

01:09.021 --> 01:12.018
Well, nice to meet you,
see you around.

01:12.020 --> 01:14.001
Let me get that!

01:14.003 --> 01:16.008
After you.
What?!

01:16.010 --> 01:18.008
After...you?

01:18.010 --> 01:21.003
How dare you!

01:21.005 --> 01:23.022
You <i>never</i> <i>open the door</i>
for a ghost.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.016
I'm sorry!
I didn't know!

01:25.018 --> 01:29.000
Oscar Peltzer,
do you want lettuce...

01:29.002 --> 01:31.023
on your knuckle sandwich?!

01:32.001 --> 01:33.001
No?

01:33.003 --> 01:34.022
Then you must improve
your manners.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.012
Only then will I put
your knuckle sandwich

01:37.014 --> 01:40.009
back in the fridge.

01:42.008 --> 01:43.019
Yeah, of course it's you.

01:43.021 --> 01:46.016
Only someone who associates
with Hedgehog

01:46.018 --> 01:48.019
would have manners that bad.

01:48.021 --> 01:50.004
I have good manners!

01:50.006 --> 01:51.010
Uh...sir!

01:51.012 --> 01:53.000
I just didn't know the rule!

01:53.002 --> 01:54.012
Yes, well, you should.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.015
You need to go
to the Emily Ghost

01:56.017 --> 01:59.005
Institute for Manners
and Magical Etiquette.

01:59.007 --> 02:01.003
Tell them <i>I</i> <i>sent you.</i>

02:01.005 --> 02:04.002
They give me a free class
for anyone I recommend.

02:04.004 --> 02:05.004
Hedgehog!

02:05.006 --> 02:06.009
Do you want to take
a class with me?

02:06.011 --> 02:08.007
I'm in!
Is there extra credit?

02:08.009 --> 02:10.003
Do we get uniforms?

02:10.005 --> 02:12.008
Wait...what type of class?

02:12.010 --> 02:13.015
Etiquette lessons.

02:13.017 --> 02:15.009
Otherwise, Ghost the Earnest
is gonna give me

02:15.011 --> 02:16.014
a knuckle sandwich.

02:16.016 --> 02:19.015
You were in there
for two minutes.

02:19.017 --> 02:21.022
Here we are.
After you!

02:22.000 --> 02:27.006
No, after you!

02:27.008 --> 02:31.001
Oh, after you!

02:31.003 --> 02:32.005
How dare you!

02:32.007 --> 02:34.001
Oh crumbs!
Sorry.

02:34.003 --> 02:36.005
I guess that's why
we're here right?

02:36.007 --> 02:37.016
To learn?

02:37.018 --> 02:39.009
Hi, I'm Oscar.

02:46.010 --> 02:47.014
Psst, Hedgehog.

02:47.016 --> 02:49.009
I wrote you a note.

02:54.020 --> 02:57.006
Good afternoon, scholars
of sophistication.

02:57.008 --> 03:01.006
I'm Emily Ghost,
I'll be your teacher.

03:02.023 --> 03:06.006
First lesson, which fork to
start with at a dinner party --

03:06.008 --> 03:07.017
Yes, what?

03:07.019 --> 03:09.018
Sorry, hi, yes.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.014
Oscar -- we met outside.

03:11.016 --> 03:13.011
Yes, I recall.

03:13.013 --> 03:14.021
So, a little bit about me.

03:14.023 --> 03:16.022
I already know all my manners.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.010
I just need to know
why it's rude

03:18.012 --> 03:21.002
to hold the door open
for a ghost.

03:21.004 --> 03:22.016
When you take your car
to a mechanic,

03:22.018 --> 03:24.015
do you tell him
what your car needs?

03:24.017 --> 03:25.017
No!

03:25.019 --> 03:28.002
You leave it
to the professionals!

03:28.004 --> 03:29.011
I don't have a car!

03:29.013 --> 03:31.013
Because I support
transportation alternatives,

03:31.015 --> 03:33.011
and also 'cause
I'm a little kid.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.007
Well then, you probably
can't tell me,

03:35.009 --> 03:37.014
which fork you start
with at a dinner party --

03:37.016 --> 03:39.012
The outside fork!
I know this one!

03:39.014 --> 03:42.005
You so rudely interrupted me
before I finished.

03:42.007 --> 03:47.006
What fork do you start with
at a dinner party thrown by...

03:47.008 --> 03:49.015
Molar Moles?

03:52.005 --> 03:55.006
If you are above ground,
you start with the outside fork.

03:55.008 --> 03:59.006
If you are underground,
the bigger, inside fork.

03:59.008 --> 04:04.003
You've got a lot to learn,
elephant.

04:04.005 --> 04:07.017
Always thank the broom
for its service.

04:12.007 --> 04:16.020
What is the proper posture
when dining with monsters?

04:16.022 --> 04:18.005
Hmm...

04:18.007 --> 04:19.008
Mm?

04:19.010 --> 04:21.020
Hunched over your food,
correct.

04:21.022 --> 04:24.021
Okay,
walk over to the Alien.

04:32.016 --> 04:35.012
You're welcome.

04:35.014 --> 04:36.016
Excellent job.

04:36.018 --> 04:39.008
Aliens love toots.

04:39.010 --> 04:42.000
Never tell a sasquatch
that you like their house.

04:42.002 --> 04:44.005
They'll feel pressured
to give you a tour

04:44.007 --> 04:46.007
and they hate giving tours.

04:49.008 --> 04:51.010
What's this do?
Nothing.

04:51.012 --> 04:53.017
I just wanted this book.

04:53.019 --> 04:57.019
It's rude to tell your problems
to a witch.

04:57.021 --> 04:59.000
Wait, what?

04:59.002 --> 05:01.001
But I always tell
Hedgehog my problems.

05:01.003 --> 05:04.003
No! Don't dump your garbage
on witches.

05:04.005 --> 05:06.000
You have to go to Shark.

05:06.002 --> 05:06.023
Once a week.

05:07.001 --> 05:09.005
Therapy is non-negotiable.

05:09.007 --> 05:10.021
Well, I do that, too.

05:10.023 --> 05:12.005
Well maybe you can go
twice a week

05:12.007 --> 05:14.019
and discuss why
you keep interrupting me!

05:14.021 --> 05:18.000
Now, a lesson on doors.

05:18.002 --> 05:19.001
Finally!

05:19.003 --> 05:20.007
Grr...

05:20.009 --> 05:21.006
Mm!

05:21.008 --> 05:22.013
One more interruption like that

05:22.015 --> 05:25.002
and I will throw you
out of class!

05:25.004 --> 05:27.000
And you better not miss this,

05:27.002 --> 05:29.022
it's going to be
on the big test.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.018
Now, one only opens a door
slightly for a yeti.

05:34.020 --> 05:37.012
You start with the proverbial
pickle jar

05:37.014 --> 05:39.010
and let them finish it.

05:39.012 --> 05:41.020
For monsters, you should
open the door

05:41.022 --> 05:46.001
and then kick them in the butt
to avoid frame chafing.

05:46.003 --> 05:47.012
Witches?

05:47.014 --> 05:50.017
Trick question, they fly
straight through the skylight.

05:50.019 --> 05:53.014
For elves, you should open
the door but never close it

05:53.016 --> 05:57.003
because they always forget
something in their car.

05:57.005 --> 06:02.009
And for a ghost,
you never open a door.

06:05.020 --> 06:07.009
Hmmm.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.018
Mmm...

06:13.020 --> 06:14.018
But --
Because --

06:14.020 --> 06:17.015
I warned you, Oscar.

06:17.017 --> 06:21.020
Good luck passing the test
without my tutelage!

06:24.013 --> 06:26.023
Oh boo boo.

06:27.001 --> 06:29.004
I feel like
she's singling us out.

06:29.006 --> 06:32.004
Oscar, we're the only ones
in the class.

06:32.006 --> 06:34.020
Besides, I'm doing
really well.

06:34.022 --> 06:36.013
I don't want to eat
a knuckle sandwich.

06:36.015 --> 06:39.016
Hedgehog,
I'm never hungry for knuckles.

06:39.018 --> 06:41.002
Don't worry.

06:41.004 --> 06:42.023
I made flashcards.

06:43.001 --> 06:44.007
Sometimes school
doesn't make sense

06:44.009 --> 06:46.003
and you're just doing it
for the validation.

06:46.005 --> 06:49.019
In those cases it helps
to make up a little rhyme.

06:49.021 --> 06:52.013
If a ghost comes by,
let the door lie.

06:52.015 --> 06:55.022
Yeah,
that's pretty good.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.019
When you see
a Sasquatch's home.

06:57.021 --> 06:59.008
Just leave him alone.

06:59.010 --> 07:02.005
If you eat a monsters soup,
your shoulders must droop.

07:02.007 --> 07:04.019
Give a hoot,
offer aliens a toot!

07:04.021 --> 07:05.022
Okay, I got 'em.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.009
Then how about a quiz?

07:09.011 --> 07:11.023
If a ghost is coming by...

07:12.001 --> 07:13.004
let the door lie!

07:13.006 --> 07:16.004
Correct!
You got this.

07:16.006 --> 07:19.011
Excuse me, is this the school
for manners?

07:19.013 --> 07:21.013
Yup, right this way.

07:23.001 --> 07:24.020
Tch.
How rude.

07:26.022 --> 07:29.023
Oscar, I love you, but you're
thicker than toothpaste.

07:32.006 --> 07:33.016
Time's up!

07:33.018 --> 07:37.001
Pass your papers to the front
of the class please.

07:37.003 --> 07:39.007
Let's see how you did, Hedgehog.

07:39.009 --> 07:40.017
Mmm...

07:40.019 --> 07:43.014
That tastes like
a full-bodied A-plus...

07:43.016 --> 07:47.003
with a zesty
extra-credit endnote.

07:47.005 --> 07:49.018
Now, for Oscar's test.

07:51.014 --> 07:56.002
Tastes like a perfectly
average C-plus.

07:56.004 --> 07:57.014
You pass.

07:57.016 --> 07:58.014
Woo-hoo!

07:58.016 --> 08:00.010
Not so fast.

08:00.012 --> 08:05.020
The written portion counts for
0.0006 percent of your grade.

08:05.022 --> 08:10.007
Now comes the part that counts
for 100 percent of your grade --

08:10.009 --> 08:13.014
The Door Practice Test!

08:13.016 --> 08:15.015
Aww.

08:15.017 --> 08:17.009
For this portion of the test,
we will be using

08:17.011 --> 08:20.020
this state of the art
cardboard door etiquette tester.

08:20.022 --> 08:24.013
When you do it the correct way,
you will hear this sound.

08:25.020 --> 08:27.019
But if you get it wrong,
you will hear...

08:28.022 --> 08:32.022
Hedgehog, you're up first!

08:33.000 --> 08:35.010
Elves in charge, open large!

08:38.006 --> 08:40.012
Witches delight open skylight.

08:42.005 --> 08:44.014
Monster chums, kick the buns.

08:46.001 --> 08:48.008
And most important of all,
ghost don't open at all!

08:49.015 --> 08:51.018
Wonderful form, Hedgehog!

08:51.020 --> 08:54.013
I pronounce you valedictorian!

08:54.015 --> 08:55.019
Great job, Hedgehog!

08:55.021 --> 08:57.015
Listen, I love
being head of class,

08:57.017 --> 09:00.020
but shouldn't we wait
until Oscar passes his test?

09:00.022 --> 09:02.001
Pass?

09:02.003 --> 09:04.012
Please, we all know
how this will go.

09:04.014 --> 09:07.021
Don't listen to her, Oscar!

09:07.023 --> 09:09.007
Just remember the rhymes!

09:09.009 --> 09:11.018
You got this!

09:11.020 --> 09:14.023
Oscar, you may begin.

09:15.001 --> 09:16.007
Hey, I know this!

09:16.009 --> 09:18.011
Elves in charge, open large!

09:20.001 --> 09:22.005
Witches delight,
open skylight.

09:22.007 --> 09:23.023
Yesss!

09:24.001 --> 09:25.008
Huh?

09:25.010 --> 09:26.015
Don't mess this up!

09:26.017 --> 09:28.017
Or I'll feed you
this knuckle sandwich.

09:28.019 --> 09:31.023
Special recipe just for you!

09:32.001 --> 09:34.019
Oh man,
come on, Oscar!

09:34.021 --> 09:39.004
Uhhm...monster goes out...
kick them in some part?

09:40.020 --> 09:42.014
Yetis...uh...

09:42.016 --> 09:43.019
Yetis on the floor.

09:43.021 --> 09:45.013
Head-butt the door?

09:45.015 --> 09:47.020
No!

09:47.022 --> 09:50.000
Most important of all, ghosts...

09:50.002 --> 09:51.020
Open the door the mosts.

09:51.022 --> 09:53.019
Aahh!
Oh no.

09:53.021 --> 09:55.005
No!

09:55.007 --> 10:01.009
I declare this student
has not learned his manners!

10:01.011 --> 10:04.003
Well, I warned you,
Oscar Peltzer.

10:04.005 --> 10:07.007
I hope you're hungry because
this knuckle sandwich

10:07.009 --> 10:09.006
feeds a family of four!

10:09.008 --> 10:10.022
Ahhhhh!

10:11.000 --> 10:12.018
Huh?

10:12.020 --> 10:15.020
Enjoying your meal,
rude child?

10:15.022 --> 10:19.013
Hey, isn't it actually rude
to punch someone in the face?

10:19.015 --> 10:20.019
Huh?

10:20.021 --> 10:22.012
Oh no, you're right!

10:22.014 --> 10:27.004
I got so wrapped up in judging
you that I forgot <i>my</i> <i>manners.</i>

10:27.006 --> 10:28.017
Ahem.

10:28.019 --> 10:32.001
Ghost the Earnest,
your manners are terrible.

10:32.003 --> 10:38.009
You must sign up for retraining
and recertification.

10:38.011 --> 10:41.010
Sorry again for trying
to punch you.

10:41.012 --> 10:43.008
It was so rude of me.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.013
I'll forgive you if you just
tell me why it's so rude

10:45.015 --> 10:47.005
to hold the door for a ghost.

10:47.007 --> 10:49.011
You see, ghosts can float
through doors.

10:49.013 --> 10:51.018
It's kinda
the only thing we got,

10:51.020 --> 10:54.011
so we don't want it
taken away from us.

10:54.013 --> 10:57.009
That makes perfect sense!

10:57.011 --> 10:58.013
After you!

10:58.015 --> 11:01.012
You're a very polite
young elephant!

11:02.018 --> 11:03.021
Oh!
Not a ghost.
