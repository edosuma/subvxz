17:09.495 --> 17:11.896
There are other species
that would kill us on sight.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.598
Or have no compassion
for their own.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.099
Animals who consume
their offspring

17:15.101 --> 17:17.535
in the name of survival,
yet...

17:17.537 --> 17:19.070
she's putting the lessers
above herself.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.105
Yeah, her
lessers,

17:21.107 --> 17:23.908
who are waiting outside
to kill us any chance they get.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.712
It's the mark on her palm.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.013
Hassler said it was
a symbol of power.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.715
She's not
just some chimp

17:30.717 --> 17:32.083
that's repeating
a sequence

17:32.085 --> 17:34.452
for a cookie.

17:34.454 --> 17:38.289
She's an intelligent being,
and...

17:38.291 --> 17:40.891
maybe she can help us
out of this mess.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.729
Do you really think that's true?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.931
You better
hope it's true.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.600
Because it's not
just their minds.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.068
I saw them
electrocute themselves.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.070
I saw them sacrifice themselves

17:53.072 --> 17:55.072
so others
could get in here.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.775
And then it's just...
it's math.

17:57.777 --> 18:01.279
And they have the numbers.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.381
And they will
win.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.035
(door closing)

18:27.974 --> 18:30.041
(radio static)

18:52.098 --> 18:54.198
(clinking)

19:07.180 --> 19:12.116
EILEEN
You look tired, baby.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.185
Eileen.

19:14.187 --> 19:18.289
Almost time to
go back to sleep.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.492
You're getting lazy.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.527
Hmm.

19:23.529 --> 19:26.397
I'm about to take you.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.300
This was always your game.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.370
I prefer it
when we garden together.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.405
My hands in the earth.

19:34.407 --> 19:38.209
Watching what grows.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.844
The soil under your nails.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.979
You wash your hands so much,
your skin will crack.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.047
(laughs)

19:43.049 --> 19:44.315
But I rub them.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.551
The lotion
that smelled like honey.

19:47.553 --> 19:48.919
(sighs)

19:48.921 --> 19:51.155
Tomatoes in the summer.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.057
They never even made it inside.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.926
(laughs)

19:55.928 --> 19:58.129
I miss the smell
of summer.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.165
What does it
smell like here?

20:01.167 --> 20:04.568
I can't tell anymore.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.337
I'm worried about you.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.975
I knew there was a reason
why you came today.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.245
Is it now? When we go?

20:15.181 --> 20:16.680
(laughing)

20:22.755 --> 20:26.157
Baby, that's not my job.

20:27.560 --> 20:32.763
I wish this wasn't your job,
but it is.

20:32.765 --> 20:36.534
You can't come with
me.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.035
Soon.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.538
Maybe soon.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.107
Miles to go.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.449
When I come home,

20:51.451 --> 20:54.952
when this is
over,

20:54.954 --> 20:57.755
I always thought I would
be able to find you

20:57.757 --> 21:01.959
(crying):
and lay next to you.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.294
But the ground that you were in,

21:03.296 --> 21:05.463
it's not even there anymore,
is it?

21:05.465 --> 21:07.598
That's just dirt.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.300
That's not me.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.802
Oh, you were lifted
from that dirt,

21:11.804 --> 21:13.170
and became part of the air.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.606
While I lay here...

21:15.608 --> 21:18.409
preserved... cheating?

21:18.411 --> 21:22.379
It's your job to be here.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.351
But is it right?

21:27.353 --> 21:30.221
It's what the
world is now.

21:34.694 --> 21:38.596
It won't be the world
I recognize.

21:38.598 --> 21:42.366
I've seen bombs
falling like rain.

21:42.368 --> 21:46.203
A sky that was green
with poisoned light.

21:46.205 --> 21:50.975
There were times
I wanted to call out.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.144
But I imagined my voice
spinning around the world,

21:54.146 --> 21:56.780
coming back to me
with no one left to hear it.

21:56.782 --> 21:58.616
You
can

21:58.618 --> 22:02.353
make the world
whatever you want.

22:02.355 --> 22:05.289
You have that power.

22:06.292 --> 22:09.927
I don't want to be alone.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.734
You're not.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.588
(snarling)

22:40.059 --> 22:41.659
Where is she?

22:43.829 --> 22:45.396
Get her out.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.497
Get her out.
Hey, hey.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.065
Let her out!
Whoa, whoa,

22:48.067 --> 22:49.733
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:49.735 --> 22:51.669
She has the mark!
We know,

22:51.671 --> 22:52.736
we know she has the mark, Adam.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.672
Then why are you
keeping her here?

22:54.674 --> 22:56.507
Look, they are
gathering for her.

22:56.509 --> 22:57.741
They are coming for her,

22:57.743 --> 23:01.045
so we need to turn her
over to them right now.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.212
We don't know that
that's what they want.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.048
We don't know what they want,

23:04.050 --> 23:07.051
but she is here for a reason.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.586
They didn't catch her.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.087
She was sitting on a
carousel.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.922
She chose to be here.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.757
That brand... that brand
takes months to apply.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.192
I have seen them do it.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.193
Then tell me,

23:16.195 --> 23:17.261
what is it

23:17.263 --> 23:19.697
that provokes them to attack?

23:19.699 --> 23:21.098
That's an excellent
question, Dr. Yedlin.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.100
Tell me, w-which card
should we try for that?

23:23.102 --> 23:25.102
You're both missing the point.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.437
Those Abbies outside,

23:26.439 --> 23:28.205
they are gathering
for her.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.373
She is their leader.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.641
That is what the brand is
for.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.109
Fine, so maybe
we should

23:32.111 --> 23:35.212
be working so she can
communicate with our leader.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.413
Our leader.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.748
You mean Jason?

23:37.750 --> 23:38.749
Yeah, you've
been gone

23:38.751 --> 23:39.750
a long time, Adam.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.218
You have not been
privy to the changes

23:41.220 --> 23:42.319
within Wayward Pines.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.921
You're right, I've been
gone a long time, Megan,

23:43.923 --> 23:46.457
but it's what's outside
of Wayward Pines

23:46.459 --> 23:47.458
that should concern you!

23:47.460 --> 23:48.459
I'm calling Jason down.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.728
He and Kerry are on
the Mountain tonight.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.631
You need to let her go.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.965
I need your help with her.
We've gotta let her go.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.601
Listen to me.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.136
We're on the same
side.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.639
They vastly underestimated

24:01.641 --> 24:02.640
these creatures.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.408
ADAM: Yeah, and these people.

24:04.410 --> 24:07.244
They are too stupid or too blind
to do anything about it now.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.980
I'm trying to rectify that.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.683
You're too late.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.405
♪ ♪

24:56.829 --> 24:58.896
(indistinct chatter)

25:01.834 --> 25:03.534
Christopher.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.402
Sir.

25:05.404 --> 25:08.138
Is the world ready for us
to begin construction?

25:08.140 --> 25:09.807
Yes, last I checked,

25:09.809 --> 25:11.375
the soil, the air,
it's all good.

25:11.377 --> 25:14.445
Back to preindustrial levels.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.215
What a privilege,

25:18.217 --> 25:20.818
for us to prepare for
Group A's awakening.

25:25.157 --> 25:28.325
I can only imagine
what you've seen.

25:28.327 --> 25:31.328
The world changing

25:31.330 --> 25:34.665
like sand sifting
between your fingertips.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.568
Yes.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.336
Are you ready?

25:44.877 --> 25:48.946
Let us go then,
Christopher James.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.763
(chuckles)

26:27.953 --> 26:30.020
(birds chirping)

26:38.898 --> 26:40.364
Those are here?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.441
Don't
move.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.378
Oh, my God.

26:57.817 --> 27:01.318
I saw a man once,
a long time ago,

27:01.320 --> 27:03.821
when he was beginning to change.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.656
He was only
the first step.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.659
But you were right.

27:08.661 --> 27:09.827
They shouldn't
be here now.

27:09.829 --> 27:13.163
The mutation should
have run its course.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.998
They should all
be dead by now,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.333
but they're here.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.168
It didn't attack.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.338
Maybe it's like any animal
in its natural habitat.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.439
If we don't provoke it...

27:22.441 --> 27:24.842
This isn't any animal, CJ.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.744
It's mankind gone wrong.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.514
These things stopped

27:30.516 --> 27:34.151
being human quite some time ago.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.187
We could go back to sleep.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.789
If you didn't
plan for this,

27:38.791 --> 27:40.190
maybe we should.

27:40.192 --> 27:43.160
We need to get back
to the others.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.028
There's work to be done.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.864
How can we live here?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.466
I had hoped we wouldn't have

27:49.468 --> 27:51.568
to encounter them,
but they're here;

27:51.570 --> 27:54.538
this is the new reality,
so we have to drive them

27:54.540 --> 27:57.207
away from here
a-and then build a fence.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.042
Over the settlement?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.879
This isn't a settlement.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.881
They don't possess
our intelligence.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.048
They don't possess our sense

28:05.050 --> 28:06.183
of community.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.886
They lost all that
a long time ago.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.354
This is our land now.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.555
Our land again.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.559
I did plan for this.

28:15.561 --> 28:17.027
I hoped I wouldn't
have to see it

28:17.029 --> 28:20.030
when I woke up, but don't worry.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.732
Humanity will
win.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.407
(door opens)

28:30.409 --> 28:31.808
(growling and screeching)

28:38.417 --> 28:40.250
KERRY: Megan claims you're
establishing some sort

28:40.252 --> 28:41.885
of communication
with the female?

28:41.887 --> 28:43.420
We need a breakthrough
before they do.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.756
How many Abbies
were here an hour ago?

28:45.758 --> 28:47.257
And look at the monitors now.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.425
There's over a thousand now.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.594
We know that
they're gathering.

28:50.596 --> 28:51.929
Yeah, as an army would.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.764
We need to
release her now.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.532
You're giving her
too much credit.

28:55.534 --> 28:56.533
ADAM:
Wayward Pines.

28:56.535 --> 28:57.734
It was theirs first.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.869
JASON:
We made this town.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.037
ADAM: Yeah, on the ruins
of their settlement.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.204
JASON:
To save humanity.

29:01.206 --> 29:04.541
After we basically
destroyed the entire planet.

29:04.543 --> 29:05.375
Look, how old is she?

29:05.377 --> 29:06.777
Huh? How old is she?
About 30?

29:06.779 --> 29:07.811
Right?

29:07.813 --> 29:09.112
Blood tests show a mature

29:09.114 --> 29:10.614
female, yes.
Don't you get it?

29:10.616 --> 29:12.249
She was there

29:12.251 --> 29:13.784
when we took it
away from her.

29:13.786 --> 29:14.818
She was there.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.620
JASON:
Stop humanizing her.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.722
Territoriality is not
solely a human trait.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.393
Yeah, well, we took it back.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.895
What's wrong with that?

29:24.897 --> 29:25.896
It's our nature to fight.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.332
Nothing's wrong with that.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.634
If you don't mind
fighting and losing,

29:30.636 --> 29:32.602
them taking this place back
and then ripping

29:32.604 --> 29:34.071
every one of us to shreds.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.941
You have tried
everything else.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.810
They are surrounding us.

29:39.812 --> 29:42.145
There are more of them
every minute.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.647
The only thing we have

29:43.649 --> 29:46.249
on our side right
now is science,

29:46.251 --> 29:49.152
and that is telling us that
this an intelligent species.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.954
So, if we can find a way
to maybe just even...

29:50.956 --> 29:51.955
What?

29:51.957 --> 29:53.824
Negotiate?

29:55.027 --> 29:57.394
Why not consider it?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.163
You're underestimating

30:00.165 --> 30:01.365
our power here.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.000
Pilcher always said these things...
He said

30:03.002 --> 30:04.001
a lot of things,

30:04.003 --> 30:05.135
and that would be fine
if Wayward Pines

30:05.137 --> 30:06.136
had remained in his head.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.504
Maybe going down this road

30:07.506 --> 30:09.039
buys us more time.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.507
I don't need another
naysayer.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.776
I don't think you know
what you need right now.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.980
I'm as surprised as anyone
to be considering this,

30:16.982 --> 30:20.317
but even Megan has been swayed,
now that an actual medical

30:20.319 --> 30:21.485
professional
has weighed in.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.020
Oh, I won't stand
for your condescension.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.855
I'm merely stating a fact.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.991
You weren't even awake
when we built this town.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.360
I schooled you at the Academy,
and I've got no problem

30:30.362 --> 30:31.495
doing it now.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.163
No, I never denied
that you had a good head

30:33.165 --> 30:34.531
on your shoulders,
but, technically,

30:34.533 --> 30:36.533
you were supposed to be
contributing much more

30:36.535 --> 30:38.135
to the future of Wayward Pines.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.136
Are you kidding me?

30:39.138 --> 30:40.170
Fertility and

30:40.172 --> 30:42.506
survival go hand in hand
here.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.674
Kerry knows how important
the program is.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.976
How could this be a priority...

30:45.978 --> 30:47.044
It is priority.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.345
This really is the inmates

30:48.347 --> 30:49.546
running the asylum.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.715
Has it not occurred
to anybody in this room

30:51.717 --> 30:53.550
that while we're observing her,

30:53.552 --> 30:55.452
that maybe she's observing
us?

31:10.335 --> 31:13.003
Don't you want to come
and meet everyone?

31:13.005 --> 31:15.672
You all can welcome
Group A without me.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.307
Come on, CJ.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.677
We've all worked so hard

31:20.679 --> 31:22.412
to finally be able
to wake them up.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.014
They'll be here any minute.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.149
Come celebrate with us.

31:27.686 --> 31:28.919
I'm having

31:28.921 --> 31:32.756
a hard time understanding
your attitude here.

31:32.758 --> 31:33.890
We are rebuilding

31:33.892 --> 31:35.025
the world.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.427
I know, I saw the world fall,
all of it.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.029
I watched that, alone.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.264
How can
anyone say what

31:41.266 --> 31:42.933
humanity will be
in 2,000 years?

31:42.935 --> 31:46.770
How could we have known
it would come to this?

31:46.772 --> 31:49.372
How could we know what
this time, this loss,

31:49.374 --> 31:50.607
would do to our souls?

31:50.609 --> 31:51.908
He knew.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.877
My
soul

31:53.879 --> 31:54.945
is replenished.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.314
I need you to have faith, CJ.

31:57.316 --> 32:00.450
You say that the world fell,
but you're forgetting

32:00.452 --> 32:02.285
all of the people
that Pilcher saved.

32:02.287 --> 32:04.154
You are a part of
that.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.589
And what will
you tell them?

32:05.591 --> 32:06.756
Hmm? Group A.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.625
You'll cut the ribbon,
you'll serve the corn bread.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.627
Hmm? And do you think
they will be grateful

32:10.629 --> 32:12.729
that we stole them
from the world they knew?

32:12.731 --> 32:14.264
Do you think
they will be able

32:14.266 --> 32:15.966
to comprehend
what they lost?

32:15.968 --> 32:19.803
In time.
In time.

32:19.805 --> 32:22.139
Yes.

32:22.141 --> 32:25.108
I had 2,000 years to let it go.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.244
They will lose it in seconds.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.083
Please, join us.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.951
Group A should know what
you've done for them.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.655
I have confidence that they
will appreciate the privilege

32:38.657 --> 32:43.393
of our continued survival
here in Wayward Pines.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.741
(carousel music playing)

33:03.348 --> 33:05.115
(shrieking in distance)

33:05.117 --> 33:08.318
MAN:
Oh, my God. This isn't real.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.653
(screaming and glass shattering
in distance)

33:09.655 --> 33:11.454
Help me.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.456
MAN 2:
They lied to us!

33:13.458 --> 33:15.926
(indistinct screaming)

33:18.964 --> 33:21.665
MAN 3: Stop. Stop! You
can't leave me here!

33:21.667 --> 33:23.833
(car horn
honking)

33:23.835 --> 33:25.368
MAN 4:
Go, go, let's go.

33:25.370 --> 33:28.672
(shouting continuing
in distance)

33:28.674 --> 33:31.508
WOMAN: This can't be true!
This isn't real!

33:31.510 --> 33:33.410
(gunfire in distance)

33:33.412 --> 33:35.478
(glass shattering in
distance)

33:40.886 --> 33:44.287
WOMAN 2:
Somebody please help!

33:46.558 --> 33:48.625
(screaming and gunfire
in distance)

33:59.404 --> 34:01.471
Friend.

34:02.407 --> 34:03.673
The people...

34:03.675 --> 34:07.377
in this town, here--

34:07.379 --> 34:09.446
friends.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.018
Jason

34:15.020 --> 34:16.453
is our
leader

34:33.605 --> 34:36.273
This is a waste of
time.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.807
Why is she cooperating?

34:37.809 --> 34:40.443
I'm honestly just curious.

34:40.445 --> 34:41.945
Given the way
that we've treated them,

34:41.947 --> 34:43.213
why would she?

34:43.215 --> 34:45.282
She's communicating,
not cooperating.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.784
If she can comprehend even more
than these simple cards,

34:47.786 --> 34:49.119
then we move forward,

34:49.121 --> 34:50.654
we try to show her

34:50.656 --> 34:52.722
that not everybody in this room
is her enemy.

34:54.459 --> 34:57.460
You should
want this to work.

34:57.462 --> 34:59.229
You should want progress.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.765
Nobody's worked harder
for our survival than I have,

35:01.767 --> 35:03.266
but we're in a war here, Doctor.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.169
Yes. We are.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.176
We have to try everything.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.545
Friends.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.929
Doc...

35:34.433 --> 35:36.499
(growling)

35:40.972 --> 35:42.472
ADAM:
Doc, I wouldn't do that.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.107
KERRY:
Stop, it'll kill you.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.041
Dr. Yedlin, I...

36:12.471 --> 36:13.636
(shrieking)
Aah!

36:13.638 --> 36:14.771
KERRY:
Get him out of there!

36:17.676 --> 36:19.075
(hisses)

36:19.077 --> 36:20.610
(whimpers)

36:23.648 --> 36:25.048
Any doubt that
she controls them?

36:27.085 --> 36:28.785
This experiment ends now.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.388
No!

36:32.090 --> 36:33.490
(shrieking

36:35.227 --> 36:36.526
Stop! Stop!

36:36.528 --> 36:38.328
If they can
learn,

36:38.330 --> 36:40.397
let's teach 'em
some consequences.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.399
(shrieking)
ADAM: Stop, stop!

36:42.401 --> 36:44.734
Hey, think about it--
if you kill her, we all die!

36:44.736 --> 36:46.803
(grunting)

36:49.775 --> 36:52.242
Kerry.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.377
(panting)

36:57.916 --> 36:59.749
If she does control them,

36:59.751 --> 37:01.851
is killing her a risk
you want to take?

37:03.889 --> 37:06.356
I don't have an answer yet
for what will end this war,

37:06.358 --> 37:08.625
but eliminating what I believe
is a crucial piece of it

37:08.627 --> 37:11.528
is not what I would
advise.

37:11.530 --> 37:15.365
Or do my words not hold any
weight for you anymore?

37:15.367 --> 37:17.600
Of course they do.

37:19.137 --> 37:22.405
Dr. Yedlin presents
new information.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.708
Let's think about what we can
do with that before we waste it.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.825
(snarls)

38:02.581 --> 38:04.647
It's a cruel joke, isn't it?

38:06.651 --> 38:09.886
Here we are, last
of our species.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.756
Best of what's left.

38:13.758 --> 38:17.360
We can't even climb out of
our own ruin to save ourselves.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.502
You may be
Jason's replacement.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.404
But they're ours.

38:34.846 --> 38:37.547
I've lived for many years
in Wayward Pines.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.683
I barely remember
the world

38:40.685 --> 38:44.287
as it once was.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.990
I worked hard

38:46.992 --> 38:50.693
to forget it.

38:50.695 --> 38:53.129
But I'm so grateful

38:53.131 --> 38:56.766
to have come so far
and to have seen so much.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.376
It's been fascinating

39:06.378 --> 39:08.645
studying Margaret
with you.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.682
But at this point
we can't conclude...

39:12.684 --> 39:13.983
Are you so

39:13.985 --> 39:16.219
indoctrinated that
you can't see that

39:16.221 --> 39:19.222
the only animal
in this room was Jason?

39:19.224 --> 39:22.292
I see his weaknesses, yes.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.229
But we are not

39:26.231 --> 39:28.231
the lesser species here.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.699
They are not

39:29.701 --> 39:31.768
our replacement.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.871
I won't surrender

39:34.873 --> 39:37.507
to those kinds of thoughts.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.010
I can't.

39:42.347 --> 39:44.414
I'm sorry.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.952
(short chuckle)

39:48.954 --> 39:51.220
I'm going home.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.790
I mean the hospital.

39:57.596 --> 39:58.895
I'm gonna take a shower

39:58.897 --> 40:00.964
and try to clear my head.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.433
I'll be back in a couple hours,

40:03.435 --> 40:05.368
and then we're gonna s...

40:08.907 --> 40:10.974
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.919
KERRY:
<i> CJ.</i>

40:22.921 --> 40:24.954
You saw them
first.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.889
The
Abbies.

40:26.891 --> 40:29.125
Yes.
With Pilcher.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.960
What do you
think?

40:30.962 --> 40:33.129
About?

40:33.131 --> 40:35.298
Was it a mistake,

40:35.300 --> 40:38.234
commencing construction
when we did?

40:38.236 --> 40:40.336
Did we wake up
too soon?

40:42.140 --> 40:44.140
We've stolen centuries.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.175
But that is a moment
that we can't take back.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.478
Why discuss it now?

40:50.482 --> 40:53.650
We'll gather later
to discuss protocol.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.985
Wayward Pines did not
journey into the future

40:55.987 --> 40:57.453
to grind to a
halt at this.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.656
I'll not allow it.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.658
I assure you.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.259
Humanity will
win.

41:25.850 --> 41:27.917
(gasps)

41:39.497 --> 41:41.564
Oh!

42:04.389 --> 42:06.456
Margaret.
