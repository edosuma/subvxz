Hi, my name is Richard Schenkman, and I directed "Jerome Bixby's The Man from Earth",

00:06.398 --> 00:09.732
as well as the movie you're about to watch, "The Man from Earth: Holocene".

00:09.858 --> 00:13.803
My team and I are working very hard to make sure that every single person in the world

00:13.929 --> 00:16.834
who wants to see the movie has access to stream or download it,

00:16.960 --> 00:20.756
even to the point of uploading ourselves to the filesharing community.

00:20.882 --> 00:24.357
But while it's true that many people will have free access to the movie,

00:24.483 --> 00:26.686
that hardly means it was free to make.

00:26.812 --> 00:31.452
Dozens of people worked for months or years on the film, and they deserve to be paid,

00:31.578 --> 00:36.670
just as you deserve to be paid for the work that you do, whatever that work is, and wherever it is you do it.

00:36.796 --> 00:40.584
That's why I'm so grateful to all of you who visit manfromearth.com

00:40.710 --> 00:42.976
and make a donation, of any size,

00:43.102 --> 00:46.475
if you've watched the movie without paying for it up front.

00:46.601 --> 00:49.202
It's a global experiment in the honor system.

00:49.328 --> 00:52.781
We're asking people: "If you watch our movie, and you like it

00:52.907 --> 00:56.881
will you pay something directly to the people who made it?"

00:57.007 --> 01:01.554
Thank you again for your support, and I hope you enjoy "The Man from Earth: Holocene".

MAIN TITLE

02:29.827 --> 02:32.817
Prehistoric chicks are kind of hot.

02:33.164 --> 02:36.772
- I'd tap that.
- Yeah, I bet you would.

02:37.975 --> 02:42.239
- Look at this guy. He's like, half animal...
- He's the same as us.

02:42.364 --> 02:48.812
Homo Sapiens, everyone? Genetically, biologically no different than you or I.

02:48.937 --> 02:53.755
We even live in the same geological epoch as them: the Holocene.

02:53.881 --> 02:57.342
It started right after the last ice age.

02:57.467 --> 03:04.015
The fact is Cro-Magnon is an out-dated term that merely separates them as Europeans, as opposed to Africans.

03:05.631 --> 03:07.645
Any of this ringing a bell?

03:10.194 --> 03:16.444
They had the same hopes and fears as us. The same ties to family and group.

03:16.570 --> 03:21.825
Actually I think they had stronger ties to group than us. And to their fellow living creatures.

03:22.131 --> 03:25.590
But let's think about it. If this man were alive today...

03:25.715 --> 03:27.956
He would be very old.

03:28.905 --> 03:32.168
Especially considering most never made it past thirty-two.

03:32.294 --> 03:37.380
He might even appreciate antibiotics, and running shoes.

03:37.506 --> 03:40.969
But what would he think of what we've done with our world today?

03:41.094 --> 03:44.161
This small knit group he would have died to maintain...

03:44.286 --> 03:48.418
is now a self-involved generation of social media addicts...

03:48.544 --> 03:54.787
so far removed from his perception of humanity, it has to seem...

03:54.913 --> 03:57.809
- alien.
- She's talking about you, bro'.

03:59.293 --> 04:01.466
(Sorry.)

04:01.591 --> 04:05.309
- Let's talk about tools.
- You're a tool.

04:05.434 --> 04:08.294
The most basic tool would be a simple rock.

04:08.419 --> 04:12.379
With a hammer stone you can break another rock and create a sharp edge.

04:12.504 --> 04:15.356
Now this sharp flake of stone can be used to skin an animal...

04:15.481 --> 04:17.507
You almost done?

04:18.315 --> 04:20.382
Not really.

04:20.507 --> 04:24.762
- Can't you just take pictures?
- That's not the assignment.

04:24.888 --> 04:30.695
Professor Shulman wants us to identify the individual markers that indicate a skull is, say...

04:30.821 --> 04:34.856
Paranthropus Boisei versus Paranthropus Robustus.

04:34.982 --> 04:37.735
- (Oh my god.)
- (What?)

04:37.860 --> 04:42.836
That's Professor Young. What the hell is he doing here?

04:42.961 --> 04:45.783
Professor Kittriss is giving those kids a tour.

04:45.999 --> 04:50.225
Oh, and he tags along.
That's so cute.

04:54.125 --> 05:00.173
For god's sake, Tara, they live together. And besides, he's like a thousand.

05:00.405 --> 05:06.054
Forty, tops. Plus Kittriss is a little hottie, so I gotta step up my game.

05:07.242 --> 05:09.217
You comin'?

05:09.343 --> 05:11.483
Yeah, I guess.

05:16.202 --> 05:21.273
Professor Young, hi. So cool seeing you here.

05:21.398 --> 05:26.366
- Isabel and I were  just doing some research.
- I'm taking Shulman's Early Transitional Humans.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.234
Sketching femurs and jawbones?

05:29.359 --> 05:31.742
Okay, here we go.

05:31.867 --> 05:35.242
Smaller braincase, slight crest on the top of the skull...

05:35.367 --> 05:38.540
wide upper jaw, but small teeth?

05:38.665 --> 05:42.264
- Homo Habilis.
- Well done.
- (Wait...)

05:42.389 --> 05:48.132
- You teach comparative religion.
- There's more to human history than religion, Tara.
- (Sure.)

05:48.257 --> 05:51.182
We were just going to grab coffee. You want to join?

05:51.308 --> 05:55.231
I'm gonna grab a bite with Professor Kittriss when she finishes. But thank you.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.380
You like these Cro-Magnons?

05:57.506 --> 06:03.069
Well, they're more of a mash-up of various early humans. But I like the cave paintings.

06:03.652 --> 06:07.490
Me, too. Hey, let's get a shot in front of the display.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.852
(Isabel...)

06:09.977 --> 06:16.070
Carolyn told me you'd like to borrow some books. Come by any time. Take whatever you want. If I haven't read them yet, I probably won't.

06:16.195 --> 06:18.960
Thank you, Professor Young.

06:19.085 --> 06:22.552
You're welcome. I'll see you girls in class.

06:25.734 --> 06:27.968
"I like the paintings."

06:28.093 --> 06:31.805
- Dude, he knows more about this stuff than the museum people.
- They're called curators.

06:31.930 --> 06:35.395
My point is, he's a very brilliant man.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.569
With a great ass.

06:38.855 --> 06:43.245
CHICO, CALIFORNIA

07:15.132 --> 07:17.735
Hey, hon.
- (Hey.)

07:17.860 --> 07:21.061
You should come running with me some time.

07:21.187 --> 07:25.725
- Running from what?
- To stay in shape.

07:29.410 --> 07:33.852
I need a shower. You want to come wash my back?

07:33.977 --> 07:37.015
In truth, yes.
However...

07:37.921 --> 07:42.391
How's this batch? Any geniuses I should be on the lookout for?

07:42.516 --> 07:47.933
You mean, anybody who can write a coherent sentence? Remember when kids went to college to expand their minds?

07:48.058 --> 07:54.055
Now, it seems to be just a perfunctory step on their way to Silicon Valley. And those are the good ones.

07:54.181 --> 07:59.060
I don't know. You really think young people have changed that much in twenty years?

08:01.633 --> 08:03.999
I like this grey.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.639
But if it bugs you, then color it. I won't tell.

08:09.765 --> 08:12.905
You know Mohammed dyed his hair?

08:13.031 --> 08:16.514
See? If it's good enough for the prophet, then...

08:16.640 --> 08:19.382
Nobody notices except you.

08:31.264 --> 08:37.515
And he hasn't aged a day in ten years. Every woman on the faculty would give anything to have that secret.

08:37.640 --> 08:41.796
- Is that what they're after, Edith?
- Oh, stop, Harry.

08:50.676 --> 08:53.887
Then switch to spin class if you're sick of Zumba.

08:54.012 --> 08:58.645
It doesn't matter what you do, the doctor just said you need to...

08:58.770 --> 09:03.916
I'm not nagging, mother. You were the one complaining about...

09:04.041 --> 09:06.878
I gotta go to class. I'm gonna be late.

09:08.387 --> 09:14.147
I'll tell you what, mother: Why don't we all just take care of ourselves for once. Sound fair?

09:15.544 --> 09:16.888
Again?

09:19.796 --> 09:24.153
She spent so many years focused on my father's illness that now...

09:24.278 --> 09:31.069
God, Isabel. You put everything on hold forever while he was... She's gotta back off.

09:31.194 --> 09:34.439
It's your life, right? Isn't it, finally?

09:45.491 --> 09:49.478
No, I'm sorry. I love you, too.

09:49.603 --> 09:52.590
I'll call later. Bye.

09:52.885 --> 09:56.725
You are a way better daughter than I will ever be.

09:57.861 --> 10:00.840
Hey guys. This is Matt Douglas from Primal Kickboxing.

10:03.028 --> 10:04.310
Let's go.

10:05.689 --> 10:09.315
Let's go, you ready? I'll take it easy on you.

10:10.224 --> 10:14.319
So I get into position. First thing I do is lead with a head kick.

10:15.212 --> 10:17.624
Then I follow up with two punches.

10:21.134 --> 10:23.207
C'mon, focus, man.

10:39.069 --> 10:39.887
(Hey man.)

10:40.012 --> 10:43.248
Seriously, man. Why do I even bother, really?

10:43.373 --> 10:48.354
Oh, my fault, man. I'm literally on my way downstairs right now.

10:49.512 --> 10:52.337
Five. Four.

10:53.590 --> 10:55.205
Three.

10:56.098 --> 10:57.642
Two.

10:59.566 --> 11:03.066
One. Boom. See how fast...?

11:03.191 --> 11:07.466
Amazing. I can't even see you, you're so fast. You're like the Flash.

11:07.591 --> 11:09.754
C'mon, I'm waiting on you.

11:11.168 --> 11:15.923
(CHICO COMMUNITY COLLEGE)

11:36.309 --> 11:39.405
- Have a great class, Professor.
- You too, babe.

11:44.618 --> 11:50.443
We're all burning. Every one of us. Burning with desire.

11:50.568 --> 11:56.598
We're burning with a fire caused by what the Buddha called the three poisons.

11:56.723 --> 11:59.500
Greed. Anger. Ignorance.

11:59.625 --> 12:05.035
Except he taught us that we can fix this. We can turn them around.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.605
Greed can become Generosity.

12:11.246 --> 12:13.988
Anger becomes Compassion.

12:16.191 --> 12:19.355
And Ignorance becomes Wisdom.

12:23.262 --> 12:27.263
There are miracles are around us all the time, he said.

12:27.388 --> 12:31.793
The fact that we're here, together, in this room, is a miracle.

12:33.448 --> 12:36.122
Isn't the Buddha kind of a hypocrite?

12:36.247 --> 12:42.726
Sure, he gave up all worldly goods, his father's money, and told us all to live a ife of restraint...

12:42.851 --> 12:47.890
and then he ended up super fat. Like crazy fat, like, c'mon dude.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.645
You're talking about those statues you see in Chinatown, right?

12:51.770 --> 12:55.355
The Buddha depicted in those statues, he's Asian, right?

12:55.481 --> 12:58.692
- So...
- It's not the Buddha.

12:58.988 --> 13:01.612
- What do you mean?
- Well, think about it.

13:01.738 --> 13:05.427
Siddhartha Gautama was Indian. From Nepal.

13:05.552 --> 13:11.701
A Chinese monk came to India, became a Buddhist, went home and started spreading the religion.

13:11.826 --> 13:17.247
The Chinese mixed in Taoism. Their monks introduced the head shaving, the robes...

13:17.372 --> 13:22.262
the fat, happy Buddha named Hotei.

13:22.388 --> 13:25.802
The actual Buddha was a regular man, with a normal body and a full head of hair.

13:25.928 --> 13:28.557
- But he was a god.
- (No...)

13:28.682 --> 13:30.636
never claimed to be.

13:30.762 --> 13:35.375
Just a man, who thought long and hard about the human condition and achieved enlightenment.

13:35.500 --> 13:40.970
Like Jesus. Only without the long blond hair and blue eyes.

13:41.095 --> 13:44.382
- But Jesus wasn't just a man.
- (No?)

13:44.507 --> 13:51.287
He claimed to be the son of God. He died, and was resurrected. So we know he was divine.

13:51.413 --> 13:56.304
You know, or you have faith? You can only know what you can prove.

13:56.429 --> 13:59.460
God is beyond proof, logic or reason.

13:59.585 --> 14:06.385
You can believe in God or Jesus through faith... but that's different from knowing.

14:07.652 --> 14:13.768
I know that Jesus existed; there's historical evidence of that. And I have faith that he was divine.

14:13.893 --> 14:18.897
Aquinas said faith is a divine act supernaturally bestowed. "Ask and ye shall receive."

14:19.022 --> 14:23.026
Kierkegaard on the other hand said we must leap to faith.

14:23.152 --> 14:27.031
It's an act you must choose to perform.

14:27.157 --> 14:33.661
Kierkegaard was more demanding, okay? He was sick of people sitting around talking about religion all day without doing anything about it.

14:33.787 --> 14:38.886
I hope he didn't mean this class, though. But, weren't we supposed to be talking about Buddha?

14:39.011 --> 14:43.005
- They had a lot in common, Jesus and Buddha.
- How so?

14:43.449 --> 14:47.384
Well... there's a lot of overlap in their philosophies.

14:47.510 --> 14:52.389
They both taught the golden rule, that we should be charitable and not judge others.

14:52.514 --> 14:56.477
But the Buddha said you shouldn't believe in something just because it's written in scripture.

14:56.602 --> 15:00.647
The whole premise with Jesus is to accept on faith. That's a pretty huge difference.

15:00.773 --> 15:06.320
- Also the purpose of suffering. Jesus suffered for us.
- While the Buddha's whole thing was to eliminate suffering.

15:06.446 --> 15:11.283
- Eliminate desire.
- Which is what causes suffering, I know. I listen. I was listening.

15:13.010 --> 15:17.002
Okay. Next time we cover the path to Nirvana...

15:17.127 --> 15:22.380
and we will wrap the semester up with Jainism. It's like Buddhism, but less fun.

15:22.505 --> 15:26.987
Jain women have to be reborn as men to reach enlightenment.

15:27.112 --> 15:30.582
We all know it should be the other way 'round. Thank you.

15:34.361 --> 15:39.315
- Great lecture.
- You never use any notes or anything. You just, like, know all this stuff.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.187
I've been at it a very, very long time.

15:41.313 --> 15:46.979
So, in honor of wrapping up the unit, we're having a Buddhist vegetarian dinner. Think you could come?

15:47.104 --> 15:49.696
- Thank you, but... I don't think so.
- Busy?

15:49.822 --> 15:52.074
I appreciate the invitation.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.900
For what it's worth, the Buddha ate meat.

15:56.025 --> 15:59.744
He never said you had to be a vegetarian. He just didn't like to see animals killed.

15:59.869 --> 16:04.919
- Who does? But you know, bacon.
- Bacon donuts. Best invention ever.

16:09.505 --> 16:13.839
- I've not seen it.
- Oh, you haven't seen it? Everybody's seen it!

16:14.915 --> 16:17.761
- So? Is he coming?
- Isabel can work on him. Right?

16:17.886 --> 16:23.146
- I can try.
- I can't believe the class is almost over.

16:25.362 --> 16:31.088
And next semester he's teaching lame Abrahamic and Zoroastrianism religions again.

16:31.213 --> 16:35.159
- There's nothing lame about Abrahamic religions.
- You know what I mean. Just that...

16:35.285 --> 16:39.747
- He should do Hellenistic.
- Yeah, Zeus and Herakles and what-not. That'd be cool.

16:39.873 --> 16:46.354
- Yeah, the only problem is he only does real religions, Liko.
- You don't think the Greeks and Romans were on to anything?

16:46.480 --> 16:51.536
Christians got half their stuff from the Pagans. Or do you need to take World of the Early Church again?

16:51.662 --> 16:56.621
Guys... We need to focus on what's important. Getting Professor Young to come to dinner.

16:56.746 --> 17:01.346
- There's so much in that guy's head I want to get at.
- Me, too.

17:01.471 --> 17:05.511
- How do we get him to come?
- I think Tara probably has a few ideas.

17:05.636 --> 17:08.534
- Don't be gross, Liko.
- Leave her alone, man.

17:08.659 --> 17:11.614
- So you going to that Delta Psi party later?
- Those guys are animals.

17:11.740 --> 17:16.309
- Yeah. Party animals.
- Liko, what're you, five?

17:16.435 --> 17:22.499
No, I do not need to get drunk on a Wednesday night, thank you. With a bunch of boys.

17:22.625 --> 17:26.050
Your loss. I'm going. Saint Philip?

17:26.175 --> 17:31.809
Saint Philip has Bible study Wednesdays. You have no short-term memory, do you?

17:31.935 --> 17:35.552
I don't know. What was the question?

17:37.627 --> 17:41.253
- John, I'm glad I caught you.
- Dr. Parker. Did we have an appointment?

17:41.378 --> 17:45.355
I gotta share this with somebody, and you're the only one I know that can appreciate it.

17:45.480 --> 17:52.277
I got this at a garage sale last weekend. It's a seventy-five year old bottle of single-malt scotch.

17:52.402 --> 17:55.531
Yeah. Paid entirely too much for it, but the story...

17:55.656 --> 18:01.203
This woman's husband brings it back from Scotland in the sixties, and they've been saving it for a special occasion.

18:01.328 --> 18:04.947
- And saving it, and saving it...
- And the special occasion never came.

18:05.072 --> 18:10.666
And he died couple of months ago, and now she's selling his stuff and moving to Costa Rica.

18:10.791 --> 18:15.342
But here's the kicker: we get home and we get a message from Kitty and Ron.

18:15.468 --> 18:18.511
The baby came. I'm a grandfather.

18:18.637 --> 18:21.983
Congratulations Gil. Fantastic.

18:23.246 --> 18:26.562
- Special occasion?
- Yes. Indeed.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.966
- To my grandson.
- Hear, hear.

18:49.559 --> 18:51.131
(Oh, my.)

18:51.256 --> 18:54.717
- That is...
- Terrible.

18:54.842 --> 18:58.951
I don't know if I've ever tasted anything quite like that.

18:59.076 --> 19:05.858
Just goes to show that nothing lasts forever. Even whiskey spoils.

19:06.905 --> 19:08.639
Who knew?

19:14.239 --> 19:16.473
A grandson, John.

19:16.599 --> 19:21.668
On one hand, it's incredibly invigorating. On the other, it means...

19:21.793 --> 19:25.169
I'm so old.

19:25.294 --> 19:30.036
Each day, as he grows, learns to walk, learns to talk...

19:30.161 --> 19:33.967
It means I'm getting one day closer to death.

19:35.544 --> 19:37.303
Another drink?

19:38.528 --> 19:40.473
What the hell?

19:55.302 --> 19:56.404
(Jesus.)

19:56.529 --> 19:58.413
That's awful.

20:02.770 --> 20:08.528
I'm not getting maudlin. It's just life.

20:08.653 --> 20:10.827
Well, this brings it home.

20:13.903 --> 20:16.608
Do you ever regret not having kids, John?

20:19.427 --> 20:23.326
Look...  I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.

20:23.452 --> 20:27.640
Don't be sorry. It's difficult to discuss.

20:27.766 --> 20:29.538
What isn't?

20:32.953 --> 20:36.775
Say, you wanna go have a real drink?

20:37.056 --> 20:40.847
I can't. I have to go home and cook Carolyn dinner.

20:40.972 --> 20:46.368
But congratulations, Dr. Parker. I couldn't be more happy for you.

20:57.312 --> 20:59.061
It's open.

21:09.055 --> 21:12.780
For Carolyn? Coffee table is fine.

21:24.523 --> 21:27.201
So, about those books...

21:27.326 --> 21:31.159
They're in the den. Grab all you want.

21:56.188 --> 22:01.274
Have you given that dinner any further thought? You could bring Professor Kittriss. Obviously.

22:01.399 --> 22:02.946
We'll see.

22:04.548 --> 22:06.600
Thanks, Professor.

22:08.465 --> 22:13.205
- Oh, and please tell Ms. Kittriss I said good night.
- I will.

22:20.617 --> 22:23.256
- Smells great.
- Thanks.

22:23.382 --> 22:30.967
It's getting harder and harder to find anything that isn't loaded with mercury, or farm raised in filthy water.

22:31.093 --> 22:36.569
- Thank god we still have Pop Tarts.
- Miracles. All around us.

22:40.029 --> 22:44.820
- How was your day?
- As always. This is the highlight.

22:45.335 --> 22:51.834
I was thinking of going hunting this weekend. I'm starting to forget what real food tastes like.

22:53.099 --> 22:57.122
I thought you'd come with me to the Hillary and Rob thing.

22:57.247 --> 23:03.614
She's feeling really down lately, and we thought a party would cheer her up.

23:03.739 --> 23:07.038
Hosting parties always stresses her out.

23:07.164 --> 23:11.430
You know... People. Laughing, carrying on.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.473
I don't know. I think I need some time alone.

23:14.599 --> 23:20.169
- You're the king of "alone", John. Why not give the opposite a chance?
- (I have.)

23:20.294 --> 23:22.595
Doesn't work so well for me.

23:24.387 --> 23:26.486
(Okay. I know.)

23:26.895 --> 23:29.144
I'm gonna go change.

23:39.379 --> 23:42.318
God, you scared the crap out of me.

23:42.443 --> 23:48.677
You didn't miss anything. Typical Delta Psi party. Pack as many people as you can into a room and spray them down with beer.

23:48.802 --> 23:53.574
- Figuratively speaking, I hope?
- For the most part. What's that?

23:53.699 --> 23:57.739
- Book on early man I borrowed from Professor Young.
- How'd it go?

23:57.864 --> 24:02.610
I asked again about dinner. Told him he could bring Professor Kittriss.

24:02.736 --> 24:05.484
What for? Last thing we need is another chick.

24:05.610 --> 24:11.864
Anyway, this guy Jenkins is an archeologist with a lot of field work under his belt.

24:11.990 --> 24:17.705
The book's really good. But the spine wasn't even cracked, although it's personally signed.

24:17.830 --> 24:21.121
He's cute. Or was.

24:21.910 --> 24:26.332
"To my dear friend John Oldman." Wait, what?

24:26.457 --> 24:30.154
I know, right? Maybe he was kidding. "Old man" instead of "young"?

24:30.279 --> 24:35.950
It's dated May 2007. So that would make Professor Young, like, thirty three maybe.

24:36.075 --> 24:42.332
Exactly. You're not gonna call an old man "old man". You're gonna call a young guy that. Like calling a big guy "tiny".

24:42.457 --> 24:47.825
- But it's not "old man". It's "Oldman".
- And maybe it's Kittriss's book.

24:47.950 --> 24:52.781
- So who's this Jenkins guy?
- Let's go to the Interwebs.

24:53.614 --> 24:57.536
(Let's see. Arthur M. Jenkins.)

25:00.705 --> 25:05.935
Taught at Santa Clarita University. Zillion archeology digs.

25:06.060 --> 25:12.934
Oh, academic awards. Blah, blah, blah... He wrote some other books...

25:14.442 --> 25:17.055
But this last one...

25:17.181 --> 25:17.973
(What?)

25:18.098 --> 25:21.411
"The Longest Night: My Conversation with the Man From Earth"...

25:21.536 --> 25:28.733
about the night he spent with a university professor named John Oldman who claimed to be 14,000 years old.

25:29.340 --> 25:34.683
And the comments are... Scathing puts it mildly. Yikes.

25:34.809 --> 25:40.121
"...Longest Night would merely be melodramatic sci-fi nonsense, but the author presents this hokum as non-fiction...

25:40.246 --> 25:44.692
and thus abandons any academic authority he may have once possessed."

25:46.153 --> 25:50.630
Ooh, get this one: "Offensive to the religious and non-religious alike...

25:50.755 --> 25:55.146
Jenkins asks us to believe that the savior himself is a practicing Buddhist who walks among us...

25:55.271 --> 25:58.889
in the guise of a handsome, mild-mannered university professor."

25:59.014 --> 26:02.892
That sounds like Professor Young. He knows everything about Buddhism.

26:03.018 --> 26:06.021
Yeah, but the savior. Like, Jesus?

26:06.146 --> 26:09.357
He could totally be my own, personal Jesus.

26:13.325 --> 26:17.293
We are totally getting that book.

26:30.606 --> 26:32.631
Like a thief in the night.

26:37.591 --> 26:41.430
I woke you, I'm sorry. I must be getting out of practice.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.876
At being sneaky?

26:44.002 --> 26:45.877
Stealthy.

26:46.486 --> 26:50.825
You really have to go? We could spend the whole weekend in bed.

26:50.950 --> 26:54.486
- And go to Hillary and Rob's thing.
- Fair trade, isn't it?

26:54.611 --> 26:58.115
I'm going stir crazy, Carolyn.

26:58.240 --> 27:02.370
- I hate when you disappear.
- I'm know, it's just something's...

27:02.495 --> 27:06.326
something's not right. I'm not bouncing back the way I'm used to doing.

27:06.451 --> 27:09.509
It's called "getting older".

27:10.210 --> 27:15.107
But if you insist on stomping around the woods like a cave man...

27:15.232 --> 27:18.927
I suppose it's a better mid-life-crisis thing to do than...

27:19.052 --> 27:24.426
buying a motorcycle and taking off with some student. Right?

27:24.552 --> 27:28.736
Then I'd better try and get back the deposit on that Ducati.

27:35.356 --> 27:36.981
I'll see you.

28:59.309 --> 29:01.947
- Hey.
- C'mon in.

29:02.072 --> 29:04.005
Hey, Liko.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.078
- You kids want anything to eat?
- Oh, no thanks, Mom, we're good.

29:08.203 --> 29:10.896
- Yeah, I want something, Mrs. Nichols.
- Yeah, me too.

29:11.021 --> 29:14.302
They're kidding. Thanks, Mom. Will you knock it off, man?

29:14.427 --> 29:16.519
She's adorable, by the way.

29:16.644 --> 29:21.200
- Alright, so what's so earth-shattering?
- Can we...?

29:23.927 --> 29:26.559
I want with pickles and mustard.

29:26.684 --> 29:28.411
We're fine.

29:30.231 --> 29:32.018
So what's up?

29:34.880 --> 29:37.927
For ten years, this guy, Arthur M. Jenkins...

29:38.052 --> 29:43.075
taught at Santa Clarita University alongside a history professor named John Oldman.

29:43.200 --> 29:50.497
One night this Oldman guy gathers his professor friends and tells them that he's really fourteen thousand years old.

29:50.622 --> 29:56.256
He was born a caveman, somehow became immortal. He knew Columbus, Vincent Van Gogh, all this crazy stuff.

29:56.381 --> 30:00.171
He would always use the name John, often with a pun for a last name.

30:00.297 --> 30:06.803
Stay in one place for ten years or so, until people started realizing he didn't age.

30:06.928 --> 30:11.591
Lived under hundreds of identities, including, wait for it...

30:11.716 --> 30:15.103
- Jesus of Nazareth.
- (Wait, what?)

30:17.408 --> 30:22.317
- He'd lived for thousands of years, never aging, never dying, traveling the world...
- Studying with the Buddha...

30:22.442 --> 30:25.833
...until one day he set up shop in Jerusalem and started preaching.

30:25.958 --> 30:29.756
Yadda yadda yadda, he gets crucified, his wounds heal, he sneaks off and...

30:29.881 --> 30:32.620
we have Christianity. By accident.

30:32.745 --> 30:35.541
What do you mean, "yadda yadda yadda we have Christianity"? You can't just...

30:35.666 --> 30:40.388
It's science fiction, alright? People write speculative fiction about Jesus all the time.

30:40.513 --> 30:44.443
You should see what they write about Kirk and Spock. Better yet, you shouldn't.

30:44.568 --> 30:48.802
But he said that it's a true story. See? Says right there, "non-fiction".

30:48.928 --> 30:51.239
Oh, well, then it must be true.

30:51.364 --> 30:56.129
- There are plenty of alien abduction books in the non-fiction section.
- Look, I checked up on Arthur Jenkins.

30:56.254 --> 31:02.067
He was a tenured archeology professor, published a pile of books. The real deal.

31:02.192 --> 31:05.988
Then this one came out and he got laughed off the planet.

31:06.113 --> 31:09.657
- No wonder.
- But he did his research.

31:09.801 --> 31:15.144
Found out that the John Oldman he knew didn't exist until 2001. No mention of him anywhere.

31:15.269 --> 31:20.460
His references, driver's licence, W-2. Everything turned out to be fake.

31:20.586 --> 31:24.964
Jenkins even tracked down two previous colleges where he'd taught under different names.

31:25.090 --> 31:27.617
John Magdel and John Permian.

31:27.743 --> 31:33.559
Magdel? Magdelanian? I have no idea what Permian is.

31:33.684 --> 31:38.269
The first Great Extinction, two-hundred and fifty million years ago.

31:38.395 --> 31:43.644
They both also had fake references, and left abruptly after about ten years.

31:43.769 --> 31:51.254
And their descriptions, John Oldman, John Magdel, John Permian, are virtually identical.

31:51.379 --> 31:56.067
Oldman's DMV records somehow vanished two days after he did.

31:56.192 --> 31:59.723
Google him now, the only reference is this book.

31:59.848 --> 32:06.623
If this Oldman guy is real, he makes his past disappear every time he changes identity.

32:07.405 --> 32:12.334
Makes sense. Million years old, staying under the radar, you gotta keep moving.

32:14.819 --> 32:19.226
- Philip, we're not trying to offend you.
- I'm not offended.

32:19.352 --> 32:22.312
No, I know. It's just, you really believe.

32:22.438 --> 32:27.644
Look, I know the world isn't flat, I know it's more than six thousand years old.

32:27.769 --> 32:31.823
But I  believe a man named Jesus lived and died for our sins.

32:32.717 --> 32:39.161
Philip... You know there are millions and millions of people who don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity.

32:39.286 --> 32:43.512
I mean, Jews, Hindus, Wiccans, plenty more.

32:43.637 --> 32:45.870
(Wiccans...)

32:45.995 --> 32:48.894
Yes, but that doesn't mean they're right.

32:49.019 --> 32:54.887
Some people believe the Galactic Dictator Xenu brought his people to earth and hid them in volcanoes, so...

32:55.131 --> 32:59.081
Point is, Jenkins' book is just a story.

32:59.206 --> 33:04.708
If I could allow my faith to be shaken by the fantasies of a disgruntled college professor...

33:04.833 --> 33:07.472
then I'm not really much of a Christian, am I?

33:07.597 --> 33:12.822
So Jenkins writes a book about John Oldman. Fine, whatever. What's this got to do with any of us?

33:12.948 --> 33:14.710
Show him.

33:15.386 --> 33:18.178
I found this book at Professor Young's.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.842
Read the inscription.

33:23.272 --> 33:27.170
"To my dear friend John Oldman."

33:29.198 --> 33:31.967
Professor Young and John Oldman knew each other?

33:32.092 --> 33:33.526
(Yeah.)

33:36.448 --> 33:41.601
What if... What if Professor Young actually is John Oldman.

33:43.330 --> 33:47.190
How do you make that leap? Are there any pictures?

33:47.393 --> 33:53.104
Okay, well, Jenkins talks about several times when Oldman conspicuously avoided having his picture taken.

33:53.229 --> 34:00.237
Turning around, stepping behind someone, answering a phone call that no one else heard ringing, whatever, just to avoid being photographed.

34:00.362 --> 34:04.104
To Jenkins' knowledge, the only existing picture of John Oldman...

34:04.229 --> 34:08.353
was taken in 2006 at a barbecue.

34:15.760 --> 34:19.429
THE ONLY KNOWN PHOTOGRAPH
OF JOHN OLDMAN

34:21.049 --> 34:28.121
Wait, so if Professor Young is Jesus Christ returned, then that means we're in...

34:28.246 --> 34:30.440
The End Times.

34:30.565 --> 34:36.277
But, if Jesus never left, then he's not "returned." He's just...

34:36.402 --> 34:37.989
here.

34:43.253 --> 34:46.830
Cool. I'm hungry. Tara, wanna go get something?

34:52.400 --> 34:53.382
(What?)

34:53.507 --> 34:56.181
I found an email for Jenkins.

34:57.783 --> 35:00.166
What have we got, Betsy?

35:00.291 --> 35:03.924
Look at that. I think we've got lunch.

35:05.580 --> 35:07.369
Nice.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.080
Keep it.

35:12.206 --> 35:16.355
And there's another beauty. Alright, Betsy. Let's go.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.150
(Come on. Come on.)

35:23.424 --> 35:25.049
(Come on.)

35:32.643 --> 35:36.041
These are for me.

35:39.252 --> 35:41.572
Smell good, too.

35:43.815 --> 35:46.197
Let's make that move.

35:52.229 --> 35:56.939
Let's see, let's move this knight.

35:57.065 --> 35:58.613
(There we go.)

36:01.760 --> 36:03.495
What's this?

36:05.456 --> 36:10.939
...The Longest Night and found it fascinating. Would you be willing to speak with me about John Oldman?

36:13.877 --> 36:15.963
Dear Miss Chang...

36:16.817 --> 36:20.862
Why don't you and John Oldman...

36:20.987 --> 36:24.722
go straight to hell?

36:27.596 --> 36:29.236
(God dammit.)

36:29.361 --> 36:32.183
Why don't they leave me alone?

36:32.308 --> 36:34.713
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:34.838 --> 36:40.696
Hey, hey, c'mere, don't run away. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

37:47.768 --> 37:51.669
- I'm not so sure about this anymore.
- It was your idea.

37:51.794 --> 37:56.902
I know, but I work for Professor Kittress. And now I'm feeling really 'violatey', you know?

37:57.027 --> 38:00.283
- So let's go home.
- But I feel like I want to know, you know?

38:00.408 --> 38:02.502
So, let's keep going.

38:02.627 --> 38:06.799
- Ugh, I wish Jenkins was more responsive.
- I wish he was less of a dick.

38:06.924 --> 38:12.118
Okay, do you want proof, or not? Photos, something?

38:12.243 --> 38:13.939
(Well, then...)

38:19.629 --> 38:23.314
This is so exciting.

38:28.588 --> 38:32.455
- Pretty bad-ass, Isabel.
- It wasn't locked.

38:32.580 --> 38:36.187
Breaking and entering. Felony makes you kinda hot.

38:37.150 --> 38:42.643
- Whoa. He really does have a Van Gogh.
- Total fake. That'd be worth, like, three zillion dollars.

38:43.385 --> 38:47.448
- Cool Tazer? What's this for?
- What do you think, perv?

38:47.574 --> 38:49.432
Don't touch that.

39:01.836 --> 39:03.130
Gurar...

39:06.157 --> 39:10.182
I want to be objective, but I really want to believe this 'cause...

39:10.308 --> 39:13.877
it would be so deeply, deeply cool.

39:15.419 --> 39:18.361
- Let's split up.
- I'll do the bedroom.

39:24.219 --> 39:26.297
There's a basement.

39:54.461 --> 39:56.281
(Come on.)

39:59.008 --> 40:02.416
(Oooh. Miss Kittriss.)

40:37.900 --> 40:39.643
(THE CONQUEST OF EUROPE)

40:59.946 --> 41:01.369
Kittriss is home.

41:01.494 --> 41:02.542
(Liko. Liko.)

41:02.667 --> 41:04.251
Yeah, gimme one sec'.

41:04.377 --> 41:06.806
Hey. We gotta go.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.625
Now.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.968
- Come on.
- Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

41:15.610 --> 41:18.049
- There's a back door.
- Awesome.

41:25.962 --> 41:27.703
(Come on. Come on.)

42:16.524 --> 42:23.103
So, my cousin Janet's an art history major at Columbia. She said the painting could be an unregistered Van Gogh.

42:23.228 --> 42:26.165
Well, we looked into the authors of those books from the basement.

42:26.291 --> 42:30.806
Any history they had prior to publication is sketchy, or nonexistent.

42:30.931 --> 42:36.720
Some of the publishers are out of business, but I reached three. None of them had any contact information for the author.

42:36.845 --> 42:41.406
Each guy vanished with no forwarding address within a couple of years of publication.

42:41.532 --> 42:45.102
"Jonathan Evermore"? He wrote the sci-fi novel "Everlasting Tomorrow,"

42:45.228 --> 42:48.186
about an "immortal's search for the meaning of his solitary existence".

42:48.311 --> 42:51.803
So I called Bantam and told them I was his granddaughter, looking for his royalty payments.

42:51.928 --> 42:57.778
She said she was so happy I called, since they've been piling up since 1966.

42:57.903 --> 43:01.452
No, asshole. We're not taking his money.

43:02.165 --> 43:05.078
- (Unbelievable.)
- Guys, we're just gonna leave all that money?

43:28.383 --> 43:32.357
Isn't it weird? Every time someone claims to have been reincarnated,

43:32.483 --> 43:36.538
they were always Napoleon, you know? Alexander the Great. Cleopatra.

43:36.664 --> 43:43.409
It's never the slave who cleaned out Cleopatra's chamber pot. Or the guy making chamber pots.

43:43.535 --> 43:46.497
"John Oldman" said he knew the Buddha. Sailed with Columbus.

43:46.622 --> 43:49.541
No, he didn't actually sail with Columbus.

43:50.212 --> 43:52.321
I read the book, dude.

43:53.618 --> 43:56.173
C'mon, get in there. There you go.

43:56.712 --> 44:01.637
So, eh... Did you saw it? The Van Gogh?

44:04.078 --> 44:06.922
You starting to believe a little bit.

44:07.048 --> 44:12.106
Look, just ‘cause a guy is fourteen thousand years old, it doesn't make him Jesus.

44:14.009 --> 44:16.867
He could be the guy who made the nails for the cross.

44:18.227 --> 44:20.363
(Alright, come on.)

44:20.489 --> 44:24.437
- I was Malcolm X in my past life.
- Yeah, for sure.

44:38.881 --> 44:45.056
Hello, Dr. Jenkins, if this is you. And if it's not you, I apologize for the wrong number, whoever this is.

44:45.181 --> 44:48.642
So Dr. Jenkins, my name is Isabel Chang.

44:48.859 --> 44:55.273
I do apologize for calling so late, although I did try emailing. Anyway, here's the thing.

44:55.399 --> 45:01.572
I believe my professor is John Oldman. He's going by the name John Young, here at Chico.

45:02.663 --> 45:08.593
Please call me back if you can, okay? I really, really would love to talk with you.

45:08.719 --> 45:13.417
I know you took a lot of crap for your book, and I just want you to know...

45:14.050 --> 45:19.234
I believe you. There is something different about John Young.

45:19.359 --> 45:25.620
My number's 530-555-0168. Thank you.

45:31.922 --> 45:33.772
(JOHN YOUNG
PROFESSOR)

45:33.898 --> 45:35.939
(I'll be...)

47:25.191 --> 47:30.136
Okay, thank you. We will fax that right over.

47:30.262 --> 47:34.855
Another one? Fax... God, what year is this, anyway?

47:42.024 --> 47:45.277
- (Hello?)
- (Hello.)

47:45.402 --> 47:50.316
- I'm calling about your email.
- Yes. Who is this?

47:50.441 --> 47:53.160
This is Violet Collsen.

47:55.855 --> 48:00.333
- I'm sorry. Violet...?
- Collsen. From Central Idaho College.

48:00.459 --> 48:07.341
I've been retired for many years now, and my daughter works at the college in admissions just like I did.

48:07.466 --> 48:11.886
But it was the funniest thing the other day. She was working at home...

48:12.011 --> 48:17.451
and I walked passed her desk just when your email came.

48:17.576 --> 48:22.984
Well, I saw the photo and recognized him immediately.

48:23.690 --> 48:26.569
- You did?
- Yes, John Pleis.

48:26.694 --> 48:31.533
He was a remarkable man. You just never forget that kind of a person.

48:31.658 --> 48:36.792
- What do you remember about him?
- Well, he was the best anthropology professor we ever had.

48:36.917 --> 48:42.126
He just had a way about him. You felt you could tell him your secrets.

48:42.251 --> 48:47.214
- And he always had the best advice.
- This was how long ago?

48:48.156 --> 48:51.927
Oh, that's about 1957?

48:52.052 --> 48:58.227
- And you remember him clearly?
- Oh, yeah. He was a very handsome man, too.

48:59.229 --> 49:01.311
John Pleis?

49:01.437 --> 49:07.150
P-l-e-i-s. Funny name, kind of sticks in your head.

49:07.276 --> 49:10.821
I tried to see what else I could find before calling you...

49:10.947 --> 49:16.723
- and there was nothing. He just disappeared.
- Yes, he does that.

49:16.848 --> 49:21.956
Well, thank you so much, Ms. Collsen. This is your number if I have any more questions?

49:22.081 --> 49:26.128
- Great. Well, thank you so much. Goodbye then.
- Goodbye.

49:27.323 --> 49:30.664
- Pleis. Pleistocene?
- (Yes.)

49:30.790 --> 49:37.723
Okay. So we have contacted what, sixty small colleges in fourteen states and this was our second hit so far.

49:38.024 --> 49:41.924
Professor Young is a dead ringer for teachers in Idaho and...

49:42.049 --> 49:46.690
Western Wyoming. John Mortem, archaeology, 1979.

49:49.510 --> 49:50.194
(Hello?)

49:50.319 --> 49:52.745
- Isabel Chang?
- (Yes.)

49:52.870 --> 49:58.410
- This is Arthur Jenkins. You've been trying to reach me.
- I have, yes.

49:58.535 --> 50:03.539
Get me a picture. A new, clean picture. Email it, or text it to this number.

50:03.665 --> 50:06.501
- I emailed that one...
- (No, no, no.)

50:06.627 --> 50:12.006
Brand-new, full face. Do that and we'll see. Otherwise, we have nothing to talk about.

50:12.132 --> 50:15.260
Thank you so much, Dr. Jenkins. I'm so grateful...

50:30.383 --> 50:33.251
Hey, Professor. We know we're early, but...

50:33.376 --> 50:39.118
It's the last class, and we don't have you next semester. So we thought we'd have a little goodbye party.

50:39.243 --> 50:42.446
- I'm not going anywhere, you know.
- We know. But...

50:42.571 --> 50:46.707
- Here. Cappuccino.
- My weakness. Thank you.

50:46.833 --> 50:48.797
Quick, picture.

50:53.887 --> 50:57.469
- Wait, can we go again?
- You know the rules.

50:57.731 --> 50:59.864
Real quick.

51:03.168 --> 51:09.013
Okay, class has begun. Take your seats. Cellphones off. And thank you for the coffee.

51:15.317 --> 51:17.197
Cellphones off.

51:21.326 --> 51:24.298
- I knew it.
- He did it on purpose.

51:24.423 --> 51:27.590
I'm sure of it, man. He didn't want his picture taken so he messed up both shots.

51:27.715 --> 51:31.697
I guess after fourteen thousand years, you learn a thing or two about hiding.

51:31.822 --> 51:36.208
- But these days, there's cameras everywhere.
- He won't be able to hide anymore.

51:36.333 --> 51:42.994
Whatever he's been doing all these years, changing his identity... I mean, it's over. Time's up. Don't you see?

51:43.119 --> 51:45.520
What do you suggest?

51:45.645 --> 51:49.349
Maybe we just talk to him. Tell him the truth.

51:49.474 --> 51:52.763
- What truth?
- That we know who he is.

51:52.888 --> 51:57.229
Based on a discredited book by a lonely old crank and some circumstantial evidence?

51:57.354 --> 52:03.450
We are not crazy people. There is something special about John.

52:03.575 --> 52:07.434
We all knew it the first time we heard him speak. Right?

52:09.340 --> 52:16.254
All throughout history there have been prophets, visionaries. Men and women touched by God.

52:16.380 --> 52:21.928
Who's to say John Young isn't one of these people? Why is that so impossible?

52:22.053 --> 52:24.849
Well, it sure isn't likely.

52:24.974 --> 52:28.583
I'm not saying he's the "son of God".

52:28.709 --> 52:34.652
But if he is fourteen thousand years old, he's the wisest man in the world. In history.

52:34.777 --> 52:40.043
- He should be listened to. Followed.
- Worshipped? Is that what you're gonna say?

52:40.168 --> 52:43.051
- There could be a whole new...
- Religion?

52:43.176 --> 52:46.285
Or something, around him.

52:46.410 --> 52:52.347
A corrective for everything everyone has gotten wrong about Jesus for the past 2000 years.

52:52.473 --> 52:57.292
If that story is true, then everything I've believed for half my life is a total lie.

52:57.418 --> 53:02.349
Everything that millions and millions of people throughout history have believed, and lived and died for...

53:02.474 --> 53:06.056
is total bullshit. So, no.

53:12.473 --> 53:17.144
Okay, okay. One clear picture of Professor Young's face, and that's it.

54:20.046 --> 54:23.261
I'm not sure.

54:23.386 --> 54:27.971
If it is John, he's changed.

54:29.848 --> 54:32.065
I need to speak with him.

54:32.190 --> 54:36.730
Probably take me ten or eleven hours to make my way up there.

54:39.797 --> 54:44.848
Hey Betsy, I gotta hit the road for a few days, honey.

54:45.790 --> 54:50.176
But I'll have Suzanne come check on you though. Be a good girl.

55:14.149 --> 55:19.981
- Looks nasty.
- I got sloppy.  Stupid mistake.

55:21.141 --> 55:25.215
What's up?  Worried about your grade? 'Cause you shouldn't be, you did great.

55:25.341 --> 55:29.103
I don't know, it's not that. But thanks.

55:29.228 --> 55:31.910
Then what's wrong? Was there something specific, Tara?

55:32.035 --> 55:39.000
I wanted to apologize for yesterday. The pictures and everything. We're just really going to miss you.

55:39.125 --> 55:41.715
That's okay. I'm going to miss you guys, too.

55:44.227 --> 55:47.481
I maybe don't act it, but...

55:48.711 --> 55:51.989
I've  been lonely most of my life.

55:52.719 --> 55:58.103
Boys only cared about... And the girls hated me because of it.

55:58.883 --> 56:03.197
My parents' friends were always being creepy and...

56:03.322 --> 56:10.156
At some point you either become the person everybody thinks you are, or you just hide.

56:10.883 --> 56:15.202
I didn't want to hide, so... I'm sorry, I don't...

56:15.328 --> 56:17.129
It's okay.

56:18.219 --> 56:21.916
You're okay. You're okay.

56:22.041 --> 56:23.670
What was that?

56:25.348 --> 56:26.714
(No. No.)

56:26.840 --> 56:28.425
You know you want me.

56:28.551 --> 56:31.761
Stop. Stop.

56:31.887 --> 56:36.307
- You've been watching me for two years. Don't deny it.
- You're my student.

56:36.433 --> 56:39.613
It's okay. You're safe with me.

56:39.739 --> 56:43.148
I know who you are. I think it's amazing.

56:45.899 --> 56:50.822
I don't know what you think you know about me, but I need you out of my office.

56:51.334 --> 56:55.840
Fine, I'll make it easy for you.

56:55.965 --> 57:00.999
- Do not make me call security.
- And tell them what? That I assaulted you sexually?

57:02.917 --> 57:05.770
Tara, this isn't happening.

57:07.422 --> 57:09.507
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

57:30.133 --> 57:31.780
Well, you can't.

57:31.906 --> 57:37.159
Spring semester starts in three weeks and you have two sections already filled.

57:37.285 --> 57:39.665
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

57:39.790 --> 57:43.696
- I can recommend a replacement.
- I can't replace you, John, you know that.

57:43.821 --> 57:50.840
The students love you. Your classes filled in an hour. If you wanted to teach a third section that would sell out, too.

57:50.966 --> 57:55.845
- What's going on here?
- Something's come up and I have to go.

57:55.970 --> 57:58.673
- What?
- It's personal.

57:58.798 --> 58:02.072
- Look, I'll get Chandra and we can fix this...
- (No Gill, please.)

58:02.197 --> 58:04.955
I just have to go.

58:06.915 --> 58:09.651
Please, don't do this to me.

58:09.776 --> 58:12.654
I regret it, Gill. Deeply, I do.

58:15.383 --> 58:18.827
Obviously I can't give you a recommendation under these circumstances.

58:18.953 --> 58:22.705
Anywhere you go, I'll have to tell them about this mess you're dumping in my lap.

58:22.831 --> 58:25.335
I understand.

58:25.461 --> 58:30.130
Paperwork for the semester is all wrapped up? Grades logged, evaluations, all that?

58:30.256 --> 58:34.801
- Yes. The last couple of things, I'll take care of today.
- You're leaving that soon?

58:36.852 --> 58:40.056
I truly hope that eventually there are no hard feelings.

58:42.321 --> 58:46.563
I'll get over it. But this stinks.

58:46.844 --> 58:51.040
I was hoping to give you my chair in five or six years.

58:51.165 --> 58:53.658
I'd have been honored to take it.

59:02.244 --> 59:07.947
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just... you know.

59:08.072 --> 59:11.462
- Okay, what else did he say?
- Nothing.

59:12.807 --> 59:14.257
But...

59:15.572 --> 59:18.127
What? What else?

59:18.252 --> 59:22.932
- I think I maybe spilled the beans a little bit.
- What beans?

59:23.284 --> 59:25.760
That we know about him.

59:28.111 --> 59:31.213
What exactly did you say?

59:32.736 --> 59:36.080
Well, I... Does it matter? If he knows that we know...

59:36.205 --> 59:39.156
Then he'll disappear for good.

59:39.282 --> 59:44.674
- Crap, Jenkins is on his way down here. He's on the road, right now.
- Well, can you call him?

59:55.510 --> 59:57.166
Voice mail.

59:59.213 --> 01:00:02.097
Hey, Dr. Jenkins. It's Isabel Chang.

01:00:02.222 --> 01:00:06.620
Professor Young maybe knows we know and might be leaving here really soon.

01:00:06.745 --> 01:00:11.783
Please let me know what time you're gonna get here. What we should do.

01:00:14.949 --> 01:00:16.549
(Okay.)

01:00:17.673 --> 01:00:20.979
Let's find the guys. It's gonna be okay.

01:00:23.244 --> 01:00:27.198
- I knew it. I just knew it.
- (Carolyn, please...)

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:30.588
What, stay calm? Don't get worked up? No, why would I?

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:36.581
- I'm only asking that you...
- Let you slip away quietly, no muss no fuss.

01:00:36.706 --> 01:00:43.200
- I've left you money, of course. I don't want you to be...
- I don't need your fucking charity, John.

01:00:43.325 --> 01:00:45.432
I have a job.

01:00:46.087 --> 01:00:48.111
I need you.

01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:51.963
I'm sorry.

01:00:52.088 --> 01:00:57.193
I don't understand why you're leaving. The explanation part got by me somehow.

01:00:58.541 --> 01:01:02.572
I told you from the start that I would eventually move on.

01:01:02.697 --> 01:01:06.884
Yeah, but that's something people say. Like...

01:01:07.009 --> 01:01:10.122
"I hate dogs", "I'm never getting married", "I don't want kids".

01:01:10.248 --> 01:01:16.487
People say that shit all the time, and guess what? Five years later they're married, with kids. And a dog.

01:01:16.612 --> 01:01:18.825
Not me.

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:21.301
Well, apparently not.

01:01:23.302 --> 01:01:25.596
(Jesus, John...)

01:01:26.236 --> 01:01:30.643
How can a man with so much passion be so cold?

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.033
What was this to you?

01:01:34.158 --> 01:01:36.557
I've told you how I feel.

01:01:38.259 --> 01:01:43.033
Because I'm leaving does not mean that I don't care about you.

01:01:45.197 --> 01:01:48.454
That's all I'm going to get out of you, isn't it?

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.509
No, just save it.

01:01:50.634 --> 01:01:56.044
- I'll be back in a few days. I assume you'll be gone by then?
- (Yes.)

01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:00.590
Well, Merry Christmas, John.

01:02:01.595 --> 01:02:03.721
Thanks for everything.

01:02:17.017 --> 01:02:22.181
- Well, just keep him there.
- How are we supposed to do that?

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:27.587
I don't know. But just keep him there. I'm still about two hours away.

01:02:28.451 --> 01:02:31.462
You can't get here any faster?

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.197
(No.)

01:02:33.322 --> 01:02:36.459
I can only go so fast.

01:02:36.584 --> 01:02:40.713
But don't tell him I'm coming. That'll only make him leave even faster.

01:02:41.447 --> 01:02:46.813
- Alright. Do your best.
- Yes, I will do my best.

01:02:49.095 --> 01:02:53.059
- Just keep him there? How?
- We know where he lives.

01:02:53.184 --> 01:02:58.393
Oh. You wanna go talk to him again? You think that's the best course of action right now?

01:02:58.518 --> 01:03:02.485
What choice do we have? If we don't go see him now, we'll never see him again.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.274
Let's go.

01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:42.275
(Hello.)

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.940
Please don't leave yet. Just stay one more night. Have dinner with us.

01:03:47.065 --> 01:03:51.826
- We only want to talk.
- I think it's best for everybody if I hit the road now.

01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:58.207
- Please, professor. I have so many questions for you.
- I'm sure my replacement will be at least as knowledgeable as I am.

01:03:58.332 --> 01:04:00.634
You know that's not what we mean.

01:04:02.173 --> 01:04:04.495
- I don't know what you want from me.
- We don't want anything from you.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:08.978
- I want to learn from you.
- This looks a lot more like stalking.

01:04:09.103 --> 01:04:11.262
We read the book.

01:04:16.509 --> 01:04:18.946
Don't deny that you're John Oldman.

01:04:20.619 --> 01:04:22.290
(I see.)

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:28.529
I'm sorry. It's fiction.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:37.298
Yes, I knew Art Jenkins. And yes, we gathered at my cabin. And played a game.

01:04:37.423 --> 01:04:42.004
A game. A bunch of eggheads playing intellectual charades.

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.477
Maybe it went too far.

01:04:44.603 --> 01:04:48.841
Art got angry and I guess this was his response.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:53.596
And it's my understanding that things have not gone well for him since its publication.

01:04:53.721 --> 01:04:57.719
Early retirement. Laughed out of academia.

01:04:57.844 --> 01:05:02.656
That can happen when you publish a science fiction novel as fact.

01:05:02.782 --> 01:05:05.345
You're saying it's all lies. That Jenkins just made the whole thing up.

01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:11.280
I'm saying that just because you write a book and call it 'non-fiction' doesn't make it true.

01:05:13.462 --> 01:05:15.705
You're safe with us.

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:20.274
We respect you and want to help you spread the word.

01:05:21.633 --> 01:05:24.321
- What word?
- The word...

01:05:26.094 --> 01:05:27.830
of God.

01:05:27.955 --> 01:05:32.696
- You think I'm trying to spread the word of God?
- Aren't you?

01:05:32.821 --> 01:05:35.846
I am a teacher, not a preacher.

01:05:36.835 --> 01:05:41.759
Jesus was a teacher. His last words were: "Go ye into the world and teach all nations." You said that.

01:05:41.884 --> 01:05:44.297
Maybe in class. I teach the Bible.

01:05:44.422 --> 01:05:49.735
You are the living embodiment of Jesus Christ. You are Him. Always have been, and still are.

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.364
That is... what's the word I'm looking for? Nuts.

01:05:54.769 --> 01:05:57.470
I'm not even Christian.

01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:01.747
Were you, or were you not, Jesus?

01:06:06.391 --> 01:06:11.853
Whatever it is you kids are looking for, whatever it is you think I can tell you...

01:06:12.743 --> 01:06:16.095
You're going to have to find it somewhere else.

01:06:18.012 --> 01:06:22.705
Alright, professor. Have a good life.

01:06:22.831 --> 01:06:25.649
A good, long life.

01:06:34.633 --> 01:06:36.407
(Oh, shit.)

01:06:37.329 --> 01:06:39.705
- What did you do?
- I just tried to keep him here.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:43.235
- So you killed him?
- I didn't kill him. I tazed him. He hit his head.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.082
Is he breathing?

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:49.884
(Well?)

01:06:50.009 --> 01:06:53.009
- Yeah, he's alive.
- You are a lunatic.

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:55.697
- We have to call an ambulance.
- Hang on, hang on. Wait.

01:06:55.822 --> 01:06:59.610
What, you wanna make sure he's dead? You wanna be the guy who killed the immortal?

01:07:01.742 --> 01:07:02.225
(Hello?)

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:05.904
- If Jenkins' story is true...
- Then he's been through a lot worse.

01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:09.594
You are insane. We have to get him to a doctor.

01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:11.024
(Hello?)

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:13.935
- What did you take?
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

01:07:14.061 --> 01:07:18.629
- Art. Art Jenkins.
- Dr. Jenkins. What's up?

01:07:18.755 --> 01:07:21.560
My car died. Piece of crap.

01:07:21.685 --> 01:07:25.913
I'm broken down by the side of the road. You didn't let John leave, did you? Please tell me you didn't.

01:07:26.038 --> 01:07:29.162
He's still here. Where are you?

01:07:29.288 --> 01:07:34.423
- I don't know. Red Bluff.
- That's about an hour away.

01:07:35.235 --> 01:07:38.564
- His car broke down in Red Bluff.
- (Where's that?)

01:07:38.689 --> 01:07:43.391
- Can you tell me exactly where you are?
- It's where the 99 meets the 5.

01:07:43.516 --> 01:07:47.430
There's a motel, and a lot of dirt.

01:07:47.555 --> 01:07:52.266
- Can't he just take an Uber?
- You guys go. I've got this.

01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:58.957
Okay, Dr. Jenkins. We're gonna come pick you up. Just stay there. We're on our way. We'll call when we're close, okay?

01:07:59.082 --> 01:08:01.800
Okay. Thank you.

01:08:04.176 --> 01:08:06.391
(God dammit.)

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:11.456
Okay, so is there anything else that I should be doing? How long 'til you get here? Okay.

01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:12.594
(Yeah.)

01:08:12.719 --> 01:08:15.378
Okay, okay, I'll see you soon. Thank you.

01:08:16.823 --> 01:08:20.220
You guys go. Ambulance is on the way, okay? And take the idiot with you.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:23.363
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:08:23.488 --> 01:08:28.703
God, what's gonna happen when he wakes up? He's gonna be so pissed.

01:08:28.828 --> 01:08:31.050
Well, he forgave Judas.

01:08:32.712 --> 01:08:33.816
Let's go.

01:09:31.227 --> 01:09:32.582
(Philip.)

01:09:34.877 --> 01:09:37.046
You need to release me.

01:09:38.881 --> 01:09:40.728
(Philip.)

01:09:40.853 --> 01:09:43.135
What am I doing here?

01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:47.953
You've kidnapped me. Do you realize that?

01:09:49.723 --> 01:09:51.560
We just wanted you to stay.

01:09:51.814 --> 01:09:57.454
I wanted to go. So you knocked me out and tied me to a chair.

01:09:57.579 --> 01:10:03.180
Cut me loose. I'll leave. You'll never hear from me again.

01:10:03.305 --> 01:10:07.784
I'm sorry. I can't.

01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:12.297
Yes you can. Just cut the tape and walk away.

01:10:13.219 --> 01:10:18.070
- Do you want something to drink?
- (No.)

01:10:20.047 --> 01:10:22.251
Why are you doing this?

01:10:23.384 --> 01:10:25.040
(Philip.)

01:10:27.895 --> 01:10:31.868
- I want to know the truth.
- You want to know the truth.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:37.720
- Where are the others?
- They'll be back soon.

01:10:39.511 --> 01:10:44.320
So is there a plan, or are you guys just winging it?

01:10:44.446 --> 01:10:51.926
I mean, am I going to be tortured for information? I don't know where the bomb is hidden, I don't have any gold treasure stashed.

01:10:52.051 --> 01:10:55.806
- They just went to go get Dr. Jenkins.
- (Art.)

01:10:57.047 --> 01:11:02.024
Art is an angry, bitter man. He does not have our best interest at heart.

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:04.884
He only wants to talk to you.

01:11:05.009 --> 01:11:09.680
I'm tied to a chair and Art wants to talk to me.

01:11:09.969 --> 01:11:13.860
I'm concerned for your safety. You need to cut me loose.

01:11:19.188 --> 01:11:21.415
Where do you worship, Philip?

01:11:22.206 --> 01:11:24.819
I'm assuming that you worship somewhere because you seem...

01:11:24.945 --> 01:11:27.837
Will you please just stop talking? Please.

01:11:29.047 --> 01:11:34.321
- Wouldn't sitting here in silence be much worse?
- I don't know, okay? I'm just trying to think.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:53.064
It's the Jubilee Christian Fellowship, my church.

01:11:53.907 --> 01:11:58.853
I've heard of it. You live locally with your mother, right?

01:12:00.606 --> 01:12:02.919
She attends as well?

01:12:03.044 --> 01:12:04.109
(Yeah.)

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:07.571
She knows where you are right now?

01:12:09.348 --> 01:12:12.532
- She's at a retreat.
- What kind?

01:12:12.657 --> 01:12:15.884
Transformation Conference. It's about...

01:12:17.079 --> 01:12:22.315
preparing for the future. Protecting the church.

01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:26.080
So she's very involved. Both of you are.

01:12:26.205 --> 01:12:30.386
Yeah, her mostly, 'cause I'm busy with school.

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:33.769
You'll be more involved after you graduate, right?

01:12:35.211 --> 01:12:40.104
Look, I have questions, okay? I have some questions. Will you answer them?

01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:42.598
To the best of my ability.

01:12:44.532 --> 01:12:47.945
- I want to...
- You want to talk about Jesus.

01:12:52.028 --> 01:12:53.801
(Okay.)

01:12:56.024 --> 01:13:00.557
You believe the Bible as the word of God, right?

01:13:00.683 --> 01:13:02.292
Absolutely.

01:13:02.418 --> 01:13:05.152
How did you come to that belief?

01:13:08.814 --> 01:13:11.566
Growing up, my dad drank.

01:13:13.227 --> 01:13:16.746
He hit my mother, so we got out of there.

01:13:16.871 --> 01:13:19.582
Some people took us in...

01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:24.363
they brought us to the church, and it saved us, really.

01:13:27.407 --> 01:13:31.871
We were baptized. Born again.

01:13:32.823 --> 01:13:37.036
And you now have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as your savior?

01:13:37.161 --> 01:13:38.787
Yes sir, I do.

01:13:40.067 --> 01:13:42.416
What would he want you to do now?

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:47.754
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

01:13:49.571 --> 01:13:53.659
- Who exactly do you think I am?
- I don't know.

01:13:53.785 --> 01:13:58.055
I don't know. You're certainly the best professor that I ever had.

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:03.164
And you know more about the Bible than even Pastor Michaels, plus every other religion besides.

01:14:04.469 --> 01:14:06.758
Most of my teachers, they don't...

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:09.220
they won't...

01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:12.556
acknowledge the central truth of scripture. They...

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:18.035
believe that faith and science can't co-exist and that's just not true.

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:20.746
That's not how you teach it.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.293
That just means I'm a decent teacher. Right?

01:14:27.618 --> 01:14:32.430
I met Isabel freshman year. It was in your Intro class.

01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:37.524
She was the first one of us to realize there's just something...

01:14:37.649 --> 01:14:40.922
different about you.

01:14:41.766 --> 01:14:43.617
The way you spoke.

01:14:46.938 --> 01:14:52.344
- I mean, you saved that janitor's life.
- That was just CPR, you could do it.

01:14:52.469 --> 01:14:56.615
- You talked that girl out of suicide.
- She just needed someone to hear her.

01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:59.494
Yeah, but there's all the other weird stuff, too. You know, like...

01:14:59.619 --> 01:15:04.032
how there's no pictures of you anywhere. There's no record of you online before you started teaching at the school.

01:15:04.157 --> 01:15:10.671
I've got my own reasons for wanting to be very private these days. That's all.

01:15:13.407 --> 01:15:15.407
I mean, on one hand...

01:15:15.532 --> 01:15:21.348
what if God really did send His son to Earth to spread his word.

01:15:21.473 --> 01:15:26.466
Maybe you're exactly how he'd do it, right? Allow a man to live for thousands and thousands of years...

01:15:26.592 --> 01:15:30.585
traveling the world, collecting all of this knowledge and wisdom,

01:15:30.711 --> 01:15:34.903
and once he's got it, he starts preaching.

01:15:35.455 --> 01:15:39.517
What he's saying is the truth, so people grasp it right away.

01:15:39.642 --> 01:15:44.461
It's like Christianity. It took over the world in just a couple of hundred years.

01:15:48.248 --> 01:15:51.545
- It makes a certain kind of sense.
- And you want to believe that story.

01:15:54.756 --> 01:15:57.444
I'm not sure. Because...

01:15:57.569 --> 01:16:01.387
if you are Jesus, then...

01:16:01.513 --> 01:16:04.211
that means that the Bible is just...

01:16:06.294 --> 01:16:08.103
fiction.

01:16:10.452 --> 01:16:16.236
I want to know the truth. I need to know the truth. Can you just tell me the truth, please?

01:16:16.362 --> 01:16:19.198
If I tell you the truth, Philip, will you let me go?

01:16:20.849 --> 01:16:22.326
Yeah, I guess so.

01:16:22.903 --> 01:16:25.996
- Okay, I want you to listen very carefully.
- (Okay, just wait a second...)

01:16:26.121 --> 01:16:31.185
Two thousand years ago I stood on a hill in Galilee...

01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:37.091
and I spoke some basic spiritual truths I'd picked up over the years.

01:16:37.216 --> 01:16:40.537
And when the gospels were written they called me Christ.

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:46.683
But frankly, the whole thing got a lot bigger and went in a very different direction than I ever intended.

01:16:46.808 --> 01:16:51.439
It got violent and scary and I took off.

01:16:51.657 --> 01:16:54.203
I've kept my head down ever since...

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:59.863
and I have to move on far more often than I would like.

01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:02.977
But lately something's changed.

01:17:03.731 --> 01:17:07.951
I'm getting lines in my face, grey hair. I don't heal as fast as I used to.

01:17:08.076 --> 01:17:14.567
I don't know if it's something in the air, or in the water, the food. Something in my blood, or DNA...

01:17:14.692 --> 01:17:19.610
or a ticking time bomb in my soul. I feel different.

01:17:20.966 --> 01:17:23.269
Are you dying?

01:17:23.395 --> 01:17:28.063
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe I'm just changing.

01:17:28.817 --> 01:17:30.633
Into what?

01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:37.481
If your time is limited, it's more important now than ever for you to come forward.

01:17:37.606 --> 01:17:42.242
For you to spread the word as only you can.

01:17:43.685 --> 01:17:48.133
I've thought about it a lot and I want to help.

01:17:48.802 --> 01:17:52.414
There is so much pain and suffering.

01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:58.649
The New Testament said that I would return, but the truth is I never left.

01:17:59.685 --> 01:18:06.283
The Book of Revelation says that Jesus will rule over this planet with his believers for a thousand years.

01:18:06.408 --> 01:18:10.681
Shouldn't there be a better way to help people than ruling over them like a king?

01:18:11.864 --> 01:18:15.480
But what about the Rapture, where the dead in Christ will rise?

01:18:15.606 --> 01:18:19.526
Why not bring them into the light now? Why condemn them to darkness?

01:18:19.652 --> 01:18:23.981
- Because they've condemned themselves to darkness.
- That's harsh.

01:18:24.106 --> 01:18:30.495
No it isn't. That's the fate of those who haven't been saved. The fate of those who've abandoned their faith.

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:36.802
Everyone can be saved. Everyone can find peace and love.

01:18:36.927 --> 01:18:42.669
Why not create a Heaven on Earth, now? We can help do that.

01:18:42.794 --> 01:18:46.595
But right now I need your help.

01:18:47.528 --> 01:18:51.415
- What can I do?
- It's time to cut me loose.

01:18:57.442 --> 01:18:59.316
(Yeah, okay.)

01:19:14.348 --> 01:19:16.200
Okay, what's your plan?

01:19:16.544 --> 01:19:18.502
One step at a time.

01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:23.755
If you're the son of God, why can't you just cut yourself loose?

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.697
Son of Man. No magical powers.

01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:31.209
Okay, you want a plan.

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:36.240
There are many paths to enlightenment, including the born again experience that you've had.

01:19:36.365 --> 01:19:40.888
- But there are equally valid paths.
- No there aren't.

01:19:41.013 --> 01:19:45.215
It says in Matthew 18:3...

01:19:45.341 --> 01:19:50.974
Jesus tells his disciples: "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven."

01:19:51.099 --> 01:19:56.481
There are other approaches to enlightenment that have been practiced throughout time across the globe.

01:19:56.606 --> 01:20:02.421
- Why wouldn't we draw on that experience, and that wisdom?
- But do these other paths involve the cleansing blood of Christ? Because...

01:20:02.546 --> 01:20:05.756
The path is less important than the goal:

01:20:05.882 --> 01:20:12.219
a personal transformation that enables us to empathize with others...

01:20:12.345 --> 01:20:16.351
and bring Heaven on Earth right now.

01:20:16.736 --> 01:20:20.981
Rational humans have existed on this planet for 200,000 years.

01:20:21.303 --> 01:20:25.444
Right? The New Testament has only existed for a fraction of that time, Philip.

01:20:25.569 --> 01:20:29.574
No, no. This is liberal theological nonsense.

01:20:29.699 --> 01:20:33.869
- What, so you're a Methodist now?
- I'm not being clear...

01:20:33.994 --> 01:20:39.142
Nah, you know what? I've had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as my savior for the past ten years now.

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:43.536
I think I know who Jesus is, and I can tell you right now that you don't sound anything like him.

01:20:43.661 --> 01:20:46.936
I don't know which translation of the Bible you've read, whose version...

01:20:47.061 --> 01:20:49.755
It's so seductive, isn't it?

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:54.783
It's so seductive. The desire to believe you is so strong.

01:20:56.770 --> 01:21:02.365
But if word of your existence got out, if Isabel had her way and people started worshipping you, it would destroy the world.

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:05.697
I have no intention of starting a religion.

01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:12.540
You're a real smooth talker, Professor Young.

01:21:16.044 --> 01:21:20.134
While you're certainly not Jesus, you do remind me of someone else in the Bible.

01:21:20.919 --> 01:21:24.361
Someone with miraculous powers of persuasion.

01:21:25.341 --> 01:21:30.425
Someone obsessed with transforming the world, overturning the true message of the Bible.

01:21:32.872 --> 01:21:35.095
You're not Jesus Christ.

01:21:35.908 --> 01:21:37.682
You're the Anti-Christ.

01:21:39.676 --> 01:21:43.373
Cut me loose, Philip, so we can discuss this rationally, please.

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:49.341
Sure, yeah. Cut loose the Anti-Christ. What harm could possibly come from that?

01:21:49.466 --> 01:21:51.872
Why don't you listen to yourself?

01:21:51.997 --> 01:21:57.744
A minute earlier you're prepared to believe I'm Jesus, now I'm the Anti-Christ.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.376
I'm not sure who you are.

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:05.044
Maybe you're just a regular guy who's a really good story teller.

01:22:05.169 --> 01:22:09.942
But you're the one who claimed to be Jesus, and right now you sound more like the Great Deceiver.

01:22:10.067 --> 01:22:16.103
Do you even know what the Anti-Christ is? The concept doesn't exist in the Bible.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:23.858
It's a distortion that superstitious monks created by pulling completely unrelated passages together.

01:22:23.983 --> 01:22:30.001
Now the word "Antichrist" appears in the Epistles of John...

01:22:30.126 --> 01:22:32.271
but it never refers to a single person.

01:22:32.396 --> 01:22:37.784
You know that I'm talking about the really bad guy from the Book of Revelation, whatever medieval monks named him.

01:22:38.013 --> 01:22:45.041
Okay. What malevolent creature from the Book of Revelation do I remotely resemble to you?

01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:53.481
There's the seven-headed Beast who is wounded to death.

01:22:53.607 --> 01:22:56.845
His wounds miraculously heal. You can do that.

01:22:58.138 --> 01:23:03.811
The Beast blasphemes God and heaven, much like your theology of many paths.

01:23:03.936 --> 01:23:09.190
Ultimately everyone left on earth is worshiping him, and it seems like you're pushing for a similar plan.

01:23:10.091 --> 01:23:12.527
All that's missing is the 666.

01:23:13.951 --> 01:23:15.986
You got any tattoos?

01:23:17.716 --> 01:23:23.663
The nonsense about the Beast is fantasy literature and nothing more.

01:23:25.037 --> 01:23:27.626
You really don't believe in the Bible, do you?

01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:30.503
It's a book, written by people.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:38.649
Whatever you are, you're a serious enemy of the Bible, and your message could have catastrophic effects on the Christian faith.

01:23:38.775 --> 01:23:42.208
- You are a threat.
- I just want to be left alone.

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:44.559
I don't believe you.

01:23:47.279 --> 01:23:50.676
- I haven't lied to you once.
- (Hah.)

01:23:50.802 --> 01:23:54.444
I have an idea. Let's have a little test of faith.

01:23:55.342 --> 01:23:58.657
- For me or for you?
- Both of us.

01:24:00.207 --> 01:24:02.707
I know what I believe in.

01:24:02.833 --> 01:24:06.618
Okay. So if I really am the Beast...

01:24:07.392 --> 01:24:10.418
what do you think God would have you do with me?

01:24:12.806 --> 01:24:17.509
- Probably kill you.
- Then do it. Let's end this.

01:24:18.142 --> 01:24:23.473
I didn't exactly say you were the Anti-Christ. I just said it could be a possibility.

01:24:23.598 --> 01:24:29.019
Well, that's good news. If you're not going to kill me for being the Beast, you're going to have to let me go sometime.

01:24:29.145 --> 01:24:32.816
But there's still a possibility that you could be Jesus and I can't let you go until I know one way or another.

01:24:32.941 --> 01:24:37.220
- I already told you I was.
- That doesn't prove anything.

01:24:38.029 --> 01:24:41.021
Then plunge your knife into me and find out for sure.

01:24:41.147 --> 01:24:45.370
If I'm Jesus I'll survive. Or die and be reborn.

01:24:45.943 --> 01:24:50.743
- Maybe you're just a manipulative story teller, and I'd be a murderer.
- (That's right.)

01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:56.005
But it still comes down to the same choices: stab me or let me go.

01:24:58.485 --> 01:25:02.790
So just, stick this knife in your eye or something?

01:25:02.915 --> 01:25:06.005
Why not place it on my right side?

01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:09.352
- Like the Roman soldier with the spear.
- (Yes.)

01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:15.609
So you want me to stab you right now as an act of faith.

01:25:15.734 --> 01:25:17.444
I didn't say that.

01:25:19.321 --> 01:25:21.865
- But what if I want to?
- Then you would be...

01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:24.743
(Philip.)

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:34.711
(Professor?)

01:25:35.868 --> 01:25:37.380
(Professor Young?)

01:25:39.132 --> 01:25:42.260
(Jesus Christ. What...)

01:26:14.439 --> 01:26:18.527
Hi, you've reached Philip. Sorry I can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave your name, number...

01:26:18.653 --> 01:26:21.063
No answer.

01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:25.512
Philip, what's up? Where are you? We have Dr. Jenkins, we're really close. Call me.

01:26:27.009 --> 01:26:30.782
So what's your problem with him, anyway?

01:26:30.907 --> 01:26:33.477
- Me?
- Yeah. What'd he ever do to you?

01:26:33.603 --> 01:26:37.690
Aside from the fact that he ruined my life? That problem?

01:26:38.751 --> 01:26:40.603
Don't get salty, dude.

01:26:41.290 --> 01:26:46.477
- What happened, Dr. Jenkins?
- Well, you read my book, Isabel. Yes?

01:26:46.603 --> 01:26:50.416
You were all good friends, academic peers...

01:26:50.541 --> 01:26:54.374
He told you his story one night, then "just kidding" and poof, he vanished.

01:26:54.499 --> 01:26:58.963
I was angry. I felt betrayed. We all felt betrayed.

01:26:59.088 --> 01:27:03.236
And I left there that evening, wanting to expose him for the lunatic that I thought he was.

01:27:03.361 --> 01:27:06.153
So you became a ninja stalker.

01:27:06.824 --> 01:27:09.973
I'd given up hope of finding him until I saw your email.

01:27:10.098 --> 01:27:14.102
But that doesn't explain how you went from a skeptic to a believer.

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:20.633
I'm an archaeologist. I dug deep, looking for the truth, but I...

01:27:20.758 --> 01:27:25.572
couldn't disprove his fantastic story.

01:27:25.892 --> 01:27:32.234
- So I published. And...
- Got run out of Dodge on a rail.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.581
It sucks to be you.

01:27:36.226 --> 01:27:37.710
(Tara.)

01:27:37.835 --> 01:27:39.979
No, I would agree.

01:27:49.421 --> 01:27:53.663
- I guess the ambulance has already come and gone.
- They left the front door open. Maybe there's a note.

01:27:53.788 --> 01:27:56.922
Start calling the hospitals. There can't be that many in this town.

01:27:57.047 --> 01:28:02.039
- Professor Young's truck is gone.
- Hello? Anybody home?

01:28:02.164 --> 01:28:06.613
Still no answer. Philip, what's up? Where are you?

01:28:16.387 --> 01:28:17.999
(Hello?)

01:28:25.195 --> 01:28:28.245
- Look, there's blood.
- (Oh, no.)

01:28:40.078 --> 01:28:41.093
(Oh, shit.)

01:28:41.218 --> 01:28:44.569
Okay, okay. What went on here?

01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:49.085
- I don't know. Philip said he was calling an ambulance.
- You need to call the police.

01:28:49.210 --> 01:28:53.368
- Hang on, we don't know what happened.
- That's why you need to call the police.

01:28:53.668 --> 01:28:56.440
Philip might've done something stupid.

01:28:57.328 --> 01:29:00.210
Don't touch that. You have to dial 911.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:03.696
There's a broken chair and some blood. We don't know what went on.

01:29:03.821 --> 01:29:07.522
Two people and a car are missing.

01:29:07.648 --> 01:29:11.358
- We have to find Philip.
- No, you have to call the p...

01:29:12.429 --> 01:29:14.899
I'll do it.

01:29:15.024 --> 01:29:20.728
Wait, wait, just one minute, okay? I don't want to get in trouble, okay? No one does. Let's just think about what happened.

01:29:20.853 --> 01:29:23.937
If the ambulance came, then Professor Young is in the hospital.

01:29:24.062 --> 01:29:29.304
No. The paramedics would have stopped the bleeding down here. There wouldn't be a blood trail all the way up the stairs right there.

01:29:29.429 --> 01:29:32.198
- We're not criminals.
- No, no, you have no choice.

01:29:32.323 --> 01:29:38.997
If the cops come, then we all get arrested, okay? Forget college, forget everything. Our lives are totally over, period.

01:29:39.398 --> 01:29:42.813
But where are they?

01:29:42.938 --> 01:29:47.217
Do you think Professor Young killed Philip?

01:29:47.343 --> 01:29:50.924
- No way.
- Maybe Philip killed Professor Young.

01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:57.054
Now that is impossible. Because he would have had to cut his head off. And there's not enough blood in here for that.

01:29:57.179 --> 01:30:01.233
- That's a little graphic.
- Maybe they both just drove away together.

01:30:01.358 --> 01:30:05.606
- After having a knife fight?
- Or a ritual sacrifice?

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:11.007
Okay, Professor Young was leaving... Maybe he just left.

01:30:11.132 --> 01:30:17.201
No, because the Van Gogh is still upstairs. It doesn't make sense that he would leave it behind, after all these years.

01:30:17.327 --> 01:30:21.579
Okay, listen. Tara, why don't you and Dr. Jenkins call all the hospitals, see if he's there.

01:30:21.704 --> 01:30:25.530
Liko and I will stay here, figure out what to do with this.

01:30:26.413 --> 01:30:28.350
Sound like a plan.

01:31:02.359 --> 01:31:03.623
(John?)

01:31:08.484 --> 01:31:10.030
(Harry.)

01:31:13.622 --> 01:31:15.257
(John.)

01:31:18.734 --> 01:31:20.773
(Oh, my god.)

01:31:22.374 --> 01:31:28.313
Well, I got your letter, obviously. I was surprised to hear from you, to say the least. And a letter.

01:31:30.062 --> 01:31:32.902
Technology is not my friend these days.

01:31:39.867 --> 01:31:45.248
- It was a lot of absorb, John.
- I know.

01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:49.742
How are you feeling?

01:31:49.867 --> 01:31:54.565
Still sore. I'm not used to being injured for an extended period of time.

01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:56.596
It's only been six weeks.

01:31:56.721 --> 01:32:00.359
I've had much worse, and I'm usually up in a couple of days.

01:32:01.111 --> 01:32:06.144
- This is different, Harry.
- How so?

01:32:06.472 --> 01:32:09.981
I don't know. But I hope I'll find out soon.

01:32:11.853 --> 01:32:15.931
I like the beard. Reminds me of a Schauzer I had once.

01:32:16.056 --> 01:32:18.338
- (Ouch.)
- (Ouch.)

01:32:18.463 --> 01:32:21.250
No, no. I got it.

01:32:21.376 --> 01:32:23.104
(Okay.)

01:32:23.229 --> 01:32:26.747
- So you're living here?
- Yes.

01:32:27.472 --> 01:32:30.781
- How much longer?
- I don't know.

01:32:35.157 --> 01:32:38.801
I think I found a name for myself, Harry. A classification.

01:32:39.536 --> 01:32:43.144
- 'Holocene Man'.
- Your dates are a little off.

01:32:43.269 --> 01:32:47.565
- The Holocene only goes back twelve thousand years. And you, you're...
- (I know.)

01:32:47.690 --> 01:32:52.222
I saw the ice melt, watched the birth of the epoch.

01:32:52.978 --> 01:32:58.463
Yeah, well, the scientific community is starting to coalesce around the idea that the Holocene's over.

01:32:58.588 --> 01:33:03.159
We're now living in the Anthropocene.

01:33:04.173 --> 01:33:08.665
The impact of man's activities on the planet being so severe it's changed it permanently,

01:33:08.791 --> 01:33:11.792
creating a whole new epoch.

01:33:12.431 --> 01:33:16.129
That would explain a thing or two about my condition.

01:33:16.255 --> 01:33:18.409
End of an era.

01:33:19.008 --> 01:33:22.553
Oh, John. C'mon, don't talk like that.

01:33:22.678 --> 01:33:27.099
Well, everything ends. And apparently, nobody lives forever.

01:33:31.236 --> 01:33:32.948
What is it?

01:33:35.626 --> 01:33:40.313
John, I didn't do this, come here, for any reason, except you asked.

01:33:40.439 --> 01:33:44.403
But, since we're here, and since we're talking. I could really use your help.

01:33:44.528 --> 01:33:49.581
It's my dad. He's been sick for a while. And now...

01:33:50.541 --> 01:33:54.573
Would you be willing to come home with me? Just for a while?

01:33:56.456 --> 01:34:03.456
- I think he would really like to meet you.
- I'll go check my calendar. But I think I'm free. (Let's go.)

01:36:16.489 --> 01:36:20.398
Dr. Jenkins? Angelo Garcetti, FBI.

01:36:20.707 --> 01:36:23.418
FBI. What can I do for you?

01:36:23.543 --> 01:36:28.927
I was hoping we could talk about John Young, aka John Oldman, aka John Magdel.

01:36:29.052 --> 01:36:31.911
Yeah, yeah. I know who you mean.

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:37.739
- I don't know where he is, if that's what you want to know.
- Oh, I'm aware of that. If you knew where he was, I'd know where he was.

01:36:37.864 --> 01:36:40.372
Oh. Is that so?

01:36:40.965 --> 01:36:46.364
- Do you think he kidnapped Philip Nichols?
- I hope not. I'd hate to think he'd hurt a kid.

01:36:46.489 --> 01:36:49.559
You have reason to believe he's capable of violence?

01:36:50.301 --> 01:36:55.809
He hunts large animals with a bow and arrow, and he butchers them with his own hands.

01:36:55.934 --> 01:36:59.854
- I have no idea what he's capable of.
- (I see.)

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:05.276
- You've said this main claims to be immortal?
- Sometimes he claims it, sometimes he denies it.

01:37:05.401 --> 01:37:10.490
- Do you think it's true?
- I don't know anymore. Maybe he's just older than he looks.

01:37:10.615 --> 01:37:16.168
You describe him as over six feet, thin, with dark hair and eyes.

01:37:16.293 --> 01:37:18.325
Interesting.

01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:22.247
- Why? What's it to you?
- It's a cold case.

01:37:22.372 --> 01:37:26.020
Crazy thing. His description matches a guy, died years ago.

01:37:26.145 --> 01:37:32.645
But witnesses keep placing him at the scene of violent crimes. Sick, twisted stuff, nightmares.

01:37:33.332 --> 01:37:38.653
Always a different name, different place, but the same description.

01:37:39.348 --> 01:37:43.397
I don't think John would hurt people intentionally.

01:37:43.523 --> 01:37:49.393
- But he is certainly a skilled identity fabricator.
- Maybe so.

01:37:49.519 --> 01:37:54.909
But an immortal, identity-changing serial killer... Do you think such a thing could exist?

01:37:56.481 --> 01:37:58.528
I think...

01:37:59.911 --> 01:38:02.082
anything is possible.

01:38:04.999 --> 01:38:07.242
Hi again. I hope you enjoyed the film.

01:38:07.368 --> 01:38:09.672
As you probably noticed, we left the ending kind of open,

01:38:09.798 --> 01:38:13.982
and that's because we hope to make another movie, or possibly even a television series.

01:38:14.108 --> 01:38:16.413
But we can't do any of that without your support,

01:38:16.539 --> 01:38:20.342
and that's why we really appreciate your decision to go to manfromearth.com

01:38:20.468 --> 01:38:23.523
and click "donate". Whatever amount you think is fair.

01:38:23.649 --> 01:38:27.053
You can also help out by buying a DVD or a Blu-Ray.

01:38:27.179 --> 01:38:29.919
Once again, we really appreciate your support.

01:38:30.045 --> 01:38:34.210
We thank you for watching the movie, and for helping to spread the word.
