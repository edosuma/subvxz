00:04.367 --> 00:06.467
- I'm engaged!

00:08.433 --> 00:11.133
- I'll be real, like,
I'm ----ing cautious about it.

00:11.166 --> 00:12.367
- I think the death of his dad

00:12.400 --> 00:14.300
really was a wake-up call
for him.

00:14.333 --> 00:16.066
- I just don't want that to be
the reason

00:16.100 --> 00:18.133
why he's doing the things
that he's doing.

00:18.166 --> 00:19.500
- With our talents combined,

00:19.533 --> 00:21.500
we will have
the best birthday party

00:21.533 --> 00:23.233
that ever ----ing happened.

00:23.266 --> 00:25.333
- Ariana is still
one of my best friends.

00:25.367 --> 00:28.433
Like, I don't really know
where I stand, I guess.

00:28.467 --> 00:30.600
- Queen of ----ing birthdays.

00:30.633 --> 00:34.100
- Stassi's new "beau."
I love that.

00:34.133 --> 00:36.266
You seem much happier.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.133
- I'm so happy.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.333
- She shouldn't be wearing
those shorts.

00:39.367 --> 00:40.200
They're not very flattering.

00:43.166 --> 00:45.066
- I'm coming after
this mother----er.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.233
- I am not willing to work
in a place that it's tolerated.

00:48.266 --> 00:49.300
- Yes.

00:49.333 --> 00:50.300
- I have to--

00:52.233 --> 00:54.133
- I have to stand in defense of
the women that you've insulted.

00:54.166 --> 00:56.166

01:42.467 --> 01:44.266
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.266
- Perfect timing; we're just
putting on our tattoos.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.567
- Trouble's here.
- Oh, yeah.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.066
- You seem taller today.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.467
Maybe I'm just, like,

01:53.200 --> 01:55.600
Okay.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.667
Guys?

01:57.700 --> 02:01.100
Unfortunately,
Yulin starts again today.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.433
The situation's
radically improved,

02:03.467 --> 02:05.367
but it's still going on.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.734
One of our missions at
the Vanderpump Dog Foundation

02:07.767 --> 02:10.600
has been to stop
the Yulin dog meat festival,

02:10.633 --> 02:15.600
where they torture and eat
these poor, innocent puppies.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.433
We're hoping
that this campaign

02:17.467 --> 02:19.300
with "Stop the Torture,"

02:19.333 --> 02:23.266
it will really kind of garner
some kind of attention.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.233
So we need all the dog lovers

02:25.266 --> 02:26.500
on the planet

02:26.533 --> 02:28.300
to take their picture
with this tattoo,

02:28.333 --> 02:32.200
post it on social media,
and spread the word.

02:33.233 --> 02:36.133
Even Kristen Doute.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.500
- It might be the day
for you to adopt a dog.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.700
- One that needs a home.

02:38.734 --> 02:40.300
- I need to join
this little club here.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.500
- You need one
that needs a home.

02:41.533 --> 02:43.233
- Yeah, I'd like
something like this.

02:43.266 --> 02:44.700
- You want a Gordo,
is what you want.

02:44.734 --> 02:47.166
I talked to Sandoval
yesterday.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.667
I guess Lisa talked to James
and let him go, I guess.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.767
- About ----ing time.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.633
The Sur goddesses
are shining down on me.

02:58.667 --> 03:02.500
- Now we can go to dinner
at Sur a hell of a lot more.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.166
- Bye, bitch.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.367
Well, that's a blessing.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.767
- Thanks.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.533
- Yeah.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.500
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, buddy.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.333
- Kristen, congratulations.

03:15.367 --> 03:16.500
You ----ed my sh-- up
yet again.

03:16.533 --> 03:18.233
Let's go get tattoos.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.567
But I'm not gonna miss
the dog event.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.133
I am not gonna stop
until I get my job back,

03:23.166 --> 03:24.433
until I get back
in good graces.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.567
All I can do right now
is just to try.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.333
- Sometimes it takes
something like this

03:28.367 --> 03:30.266
for you to realize,
"Okay, I need to wake up."

03:30.300 --> 03:33.533
- I have zero--like, I do not
feel bad for that kid at all.

03:33.567 --> 03:36.000
Just because you show up
to a charity event

03:36.033 --> 03:38.367
with an adorable puppy

03:38.400 --> 03:39.734
doesn't make you
a good person.

03:39.767 --> 03:42.233
Charles Manson had dogs.

03:42.266 --> 03:44.266
- I have a happy hour,
I guess, date,

03:44.300 --> 03:46.333
so I got to sneak out early.

03:46.367 --> 03:47.734
- Are you going
with Adam again?

03:47.767 --> 03:49.433
Are you, like, dating?

03:49.467 --> 03:50.700
Are you not dating?

03:50.734 --> 03:52.533
- We've kissed
a couple times.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.533
I mean, we're not gonna
be in a relationship.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.233
- I honestly don't know

03:56.266 --> 03:57.567
what Adam's getting
out of this.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.266
I would just be very,
very, very careful.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.400
Scheana really one has, like,
one speed,

04:02.433 --> 04:05.266
and it's, like,
psycho stalker girlfriend.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.333
- And you want to be single
for a while.

04:06.367 --> 04:07.767
- Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.567
- I'm always like, "I think
Scheana really likes him,"

04:09.600 --> 04:11.266
but I get
what you're saying about--

04:11.300 --> 04:12.300
- No, and I do.
I care about him so much.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.033
Like, I love him to death.

04:14.066 --> 04:15.700
I know it--I don't know.
Whatever. It's weird.

what is he thinking

04:47.000 --> 04:50.567
when he does stuff like what
he said about Jax and Faith?

04:50.600 --> 04:53.500
What is he thinking when
he goes and calls Katie fat?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.266

05:22.633 --> 05:25.600
When I first met James,
he was only 20,

05:25.633 --> 05:27.734
and his parents asked me

05:27.767 --> 05:29.333
So you're doing your job
properly?

05:29.367 --> 05:31.633
- Yes, Peter is making it
very clear

05:31.667 --> 05:33.700
that these need to be
extra polished.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.767
- I thought he was destined
for kind of great success.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.500
You've got to have a major,
major shift in your attitude.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.734
I actually almost feel like

05:44.767 --> 05:47.033
this is a personal failure.

05:47.066 --> 05:50.667
Sometimes I shouldn't be
as involved,

05:50.700 --> 05:52.266

So...

06:26.500 --> 06:28.433
About the party on Saturday.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
- There are people who are
gonna be at the party

06:33.033 --> 06:37.533
who don't feel comfortable
with you being there

06:37.567 --> 06:39.533
given past interactions.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.133
- So you're disinviting me.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.667
- This is not her fault.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.367
This is--I'll take--

06:44.400 --> 06:45.533
- Katie just got me
----ing fired.

06:45.567 --> 06:46.734
- No, you got yourself fired.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.600
- Yeah, I get that,
but she also helped.

06:48.633 --> 06:51.000
- But if Katie can't even be
with you at her workplace

06:51.033 --> 06:53.166
and Brittany can't be with you
at her workplace,

06:53.200 --> 06:54.533
why would I put them in--

06:54.567 --> 06:56.333
- It's her birthday,
too, though.

06:56.367 --> 06:57.700
Ariana's been a close friend,
you know?

06:57.734 --> 06:59.400
I just think it's really sucky

06:59.433 --> 07:00.767
that now she's joining forces
with Stassi,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.567
you know, that she can't
include me in that.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.166
I thought she was
more of a leader.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.567
- I want you to be able
to come, but I just know

07:05.600 --> 07:07.567
that they don't feel
comfortable.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.333
- But now I guess
she's a follower.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.567

Like, it takes a beating.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.467
So they exfoliate it.

You put steam on it

08:02.500 --> 08:05.066
Any bumpies that you got,
it gets rid of.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.567
- It does stimulate collagen,

08:06.600 --> 08:08.066
so it will help with cellulite
in that way.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.533

were talking about how--

08:55.033 --> 08:57.166
you know, his track record
is something

08:57.200 --> 08:59.066
that shouldn't be ignored.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.100
And he's on this, you know,
he's-lost-his-dad trip.

09:02.133 --> 09:04.767
- He's very much on this, like,
dad kick right now,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.667
and he's emotional about it,
'cause it's so recent.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.266
When that wears off, like--

09:09.300 --> 09:11.734
- Is he gonna go back
into his old ways?

09:11.767 --> 09:13.600
- I think it's changed him.

09:13.633 --> 09:15.500
I'm not like,
just 'cause we're engaged,

09:15.533 --> 09:18.133
that I'm, like, looking past
everything that he's ever done,

09:18.166 --> 09:19.567
'cause that's not
what I'm doing at all.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.100
It's just,
I see the change so much,

09:22.133 --> 09:23.467
and we've never been
this happy.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.533
It's really hurtful

09:25.567 --> 09:27.133
hearing that Tom and Ariana
are talking like this.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.633
It's almost like
we just started dating again.

09:28.667 --> 09:31.000
It feels like
a brand-new relationship.

09:31.033 --> 09:33.266
They were just helping us
celebrate our engagement.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.633
Everybody was happy for us.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.567
And then I hear this.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.100
'Cause even last year, like,

09:45.133 --> 09:46.567
I didn't really have his back
that much--

09:46.600 --> 09:49.133
- You were angry.
- Yeah, I was so angry.

09:49.166 --> 09:51.467
And I knew that what all
my friends were saying is true.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.533
But I feel like there's just
such a change that I've seen.

09:53.567 --> 09:54.567
And, like...
- It's amazing.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.033
- He's my fiancé now,

09:56.066 --> 09:57.734
and he's gonna be
my real family.

09:57.767 --> 10:00.166
That's how I think of it:
like, he's my family.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.600
I mean, I'm just gonna
follow my heart.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.500
I'm concerned about James.

10:08.533 --> 10:11.533
- Don't take his Tuesday.
Please.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.233
You're his mother figure.

10:14.266 --> 10:17.734
- No, you're his mother figure.

Hi.
- Got some bread.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.100
- Wait, I'm so hungry.

10:41.133 --> 10:42.300
I haven't eaten anything
all day long.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.100
- I'm starving.

10:44.133 --> 10:45.266
I thought this Italian thing

10:45.300 --> 10:46.734
would bring back
some fun memories.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.333
- Now we can piss orange
all over again

10:49.367 --> 10:51.667

10:53.667 --> 10:55.700
Beau and I went to Europe.
It was so sweet.

10:55.734 --> 10:57.567
He literally, like,
surprised me

10:57.600 --> 11:00.200
by taking me to, like,
so many different cemeteries.

11:00.233 --> 11:03.233
Tombs everywhere.

11:03.266 --> 11:06.133
You're such a good boyfriend.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.200
- It was, like,
really thoughtful.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.300
The cheese
is not gonna taste the same

11:10.333 --> 11:11.700
as it did in Italy.

11:11.734 --> 11:13.400
- It's just sh--.

11:13.433 --> 11:16.767
- Everything here is sh--.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.133
Oh, my God,
we're ----ing weird.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.300
Beau is so different
from Patrick.

11:21.333 --> 11:24.133
He doesn't use
a bunch of words I don't know

11:24.166 --> 11:26.000
to be condescending.

11:26.033 --> 11:29.600
- You have a unique ability
to, like, galvanize people.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.667
You have to treat
every relationship,

11:31.700 --> 11:34.266
like, myopically.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.700
- I'm sorry, Patrick.

11:35.734 --> 11:38.133
I hope I'm not
viewing this myopically,

11:38.166 --> 11:41.233
but I just feel so galvanized
by this new relationship,

11:41.266 --> 11:43.133
you ----ing dick.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.066
I'm turning 30.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.633
- It's all downhill.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.000
- Listen, I'm excited about
being 30,

11:53.033 --> 11:55.133
because I feel like
I'm now, like, a woman.

11:55.166 --> 11:58.300
Turning 30, it's a milestone,
you know?

11:58.333 --> 12:00.600
And, honestly, I just feel
really proud.

12:00.633 --> 12:01.767
I love you.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.700
- Te amo.
- Te amo.

12:03.734 --> 12:05.300
I have a great
relationship now,

12:05.333 --> 12:07.600
and I have all of these
great friends.

12:07.633 --> 12:09.233
Like, 23-year-old Stassi

12:09.266 --> 12:13.000

12:13.033 --> 12:14.367
Everyone, shut the  up!

12:14.400 --> 12:17.200
This is my ----ing birthday!

12:17.233 --> 12:18.767

12:19.000 --> 12:20.400
I'm a ----ing adult.

not a night bed.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.300
Can you only sleep on it
in the daytime?

12:39.333 --> 12:40.700
- We can try it out.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.266
I'm gonna take
a quick shower.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.633
You're welcome to join me.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.767
Thanks.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.433
- Yes, I am attracted to Adam.

12:49.467 --> 12:51.367
But, like, he tells me
all the time

12:51.400 --> 12:54.200
he doesn't want a relationship.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.100
I'll leave the door open
just in case.

12:56.133 --> 12:58.033
- No, it'd be bad news.

12:58.066 --> 13:00.066
- I would definitely take it
a step further,

13:00.100 --> 13:02.066
but Adam doesn't give me sex.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.166
- Can you turn
the air conditioning on

13:03.200 --> 13:04.433
a little bit?

13:04.467 --> 13:06.200
- I'm gonna set it
to 69 degrees.

13:06.233 --> 13:07.333
- Oh!

13:07.367 --> 13:09.333
- Nice, nice.

13:09.367 --> 13:10.433
- I'm sweating my ass off.

13:10.467 --> 13:11.767
- Um, if you're hot,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.667
you could always
take your shirt off.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.667
That doesn't mean I don't like
to flirt with him.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.200
We should probably
eat something.

13:17.233 --> 13:18.300
Um...

13:18.333 --> 13:20.000
I mean, he's hot as ,

13:20.033 --> 13:21.367
and, like, maybe one time
he'll say yes.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.734
But I do have a burrito,
if you want it.

13:22.767 --> 13:23.767
- Please.
- Okay.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.066
- That'll be my pay

13:25.100 --> 13:26.433
for putting together
your daybed.

13:26.467 --> 13:29.100
- Oh, I was gonna pay you
better than that,

13:29.133 --> 13:31.433
but if that's all you want,
you're a ----ing cheap date.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.734
He makes my vagina dance.

13:33.767 --> 13:37.266
- Hey, do you know any details
for tomorrow at all?

13:37.300 --> 13:40.200
- Um, I think
the party is at 8:00.

13:40.233 --> 13:43.133
So, I mean, I just assumed
we'd go together, right?

13:43.166 --> 13:44.767
- I don't know anything
about it.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.266

it's winter theme.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.367

13:49.400 --> 13:51.133

"Game of Thrones"?

13:51.166 --> 13:52.300
- Yes.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.266
- That's, like,
the inspiration.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.133
- White Walker kind of thing.
- Yes.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.400
I think that's what Katie said
she's going as.

13:58.433 --> 13:59.467
- You don't watch
"Game of Thrones."

13:59.500 --> 14:01.000
- I don't. I know.

14:01.033 --> 14:02.500
Remember
we had this discussion?

14:02.533 --> 14:04.300

because when he's sober,
he's a different person.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.100
- No, I understand that,
but the point is,

15:50.133 --> 15:54.166
if women are attacking him,
how does he defend himself?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.367
- Not like that.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.166
- People provoke him, Lisa!

"You're a slut.

16:16.066 --> 16:18.266
You're a ----ing whore.
you."

16:19.533 --> 16:21.433
Because let me tell you
something.

16:21.467 --> 16:24.233
If nobody sets him off,
he's not gonna set himself off.

16:24.266 --> 16:26.367
- If you're defending
his actions,

16:26.400 --> 16:28.033

I want you to understand that.
- Thank you.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.633
- I do think
he should be in therapy

16:40.667 --> 16:42.300
and he should be talking
to people

16:42.333 --> 16:43.633
and learning to deal
with controlling his anger.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.300
That's the first thing,
I think.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.533
Then you need to say to him,

16:47.567 --> 16:50.567
"You never speak to a woman
the way you have been"--

16:50.600 --> 16:53.066

in him.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.567
to be able to have balls
towards him,

16:59.600 --> 17:01.233
because I made
so many mistakes,

17:01.266 --> 17:03.633
and I was so ashamed
as a mother.

17:03.667 --> 17:08.400
So I allowed even him
to speak to me.

17:08.433 --> 17:09.567
And things will change.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.266
- Well, there's the key.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.400
I think Jacque's being
incredibly honest

17:13.433 --> 17:15.166
saying that she made mistakes,

17:15.200 --> 17:18.667

a lot of admiration.

17:18.700 --> 17:22.333
There's no perfect parent,
but a sober parent

17:22.367 --> 17:25.400
is gonna make
a lot wiser decisions.

17:25.433 --> 17:27.166
- Now I'm gonna ask you
something.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.633
- Yeah.

17:28.667 --> 17:32.100
- Can he please just have--

17:32.133 --> 17:34.233
just give him
the Tuesday night.

17:34.266 --> 17:36.533
Lisa, if you take everything
away from him,

17:36.567 --> 17:38.533
I--that scares me.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.433
It's a lot at once.

17:40.467 --> 17:44.233
It is just pounding somebody
while they're already down.

17:44.266 --> 17:47.333
Don't do it.
Don't take his Tuesday.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.467
Please.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.500

17:52.533 --> 17:54.533

17:54.567 --> 17:57.333
You can't.
Lisa, you can't.

17:59.333 --> 18:03.200
Well, right now,
I cannot put him in Sur

to some of the girls.

18:05.367 --> 18:08.100

18:08.133 --> 18:11.200
You're his mother figure.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.600

36:11.467 --> 36:12.633
but I don't need to explain
any of this to you.

36:12.667 --> 36:14.333
This is between
Brittany and I.

36:14.367 --> 36:15.567
What you and Ariana go through
is what--

36:15.600 --> 36:17.066
I would never impose.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.700
I would never talk to Brittany
and be like,

36:18.734 --> 36:20.467
"Man, I think Ariana
and Tom's relationship"--

36:20.500 --> 36:21.500
I just wouldn't do that.

36:21.533 --> 36:22.700
Apparently, Tom Sandoval's

36:22.734 --> 36:24.367
and Ariana's relationship
is perfect.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.066
She wants nothing to do
with marriage.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.433
He wants to get married.

36:27.467 --> 36:28.767
- I guess my concern was--
is that, like,

36:29.000 --> 36:30.567
when the dust settles,

36:30.600 --> 36:33.333
when it's not something
that's always on your mind,

36:33.367 --> 36:34.533
you know, like, about
your dad and everything--

36:34.567 --> 36:36.033
- I would never do that.

36:36.066 --> 36:37.567
My parents
have never gotten divorced.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.700
My grandparents
have never gotten divorced.

36:38.734 --> 36:40.266
I don't want to get divorced.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.700
So I was waiting
for the right time,

36:41.734 --> 36:44.367
and six months after my father
is the right time.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.433
Like, I just--the things
that she did for me

36:46.467 --> 36:48.767
and the things that we worked
before all this

36:49.000 --> 36:51.500
and just the fact that she
wanted to work this out

36:51.533 --> 36:53.066
after all the crap too...

36:53.100 --> 36:54.734
- Listen, Jax, I apologize.

36:54.767 --> 36:57.567
I just--I've known you
for so long,

36:57.600 --> 36:59.066
and I just--

36:59.100 --> 37:00.100
- I know
I have bad tendencies.

37:00.133 --> 37:01.700
I know, but at some point,

37:01.734 --> 37:03.300
you got to ----ing wake up
and do the right thing.

37:03.333 --> 37:04.633
- Okay.
All right, Jax.

37:04.667 --> 37:05.734
- And this is
my doing the right thing.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.367
I'm over it.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.567
Unlike Tom is treating me
right now,

37:09.600 --> 37:11.533
I will be happy for him
when he gets engaged.

37:11.567 --> 37:13.000
Let's get a shot.
You want a shot?

37:13.033 --> 37:14.467
- Let's do a shot.
- Let's do a shot.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.767
I just know
that's never gonna happen.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.633
- Hey, I love you, man.
- I love you too.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.767
- You guys are wanting him
to fail.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.467
If anyone body-shames
my best friend,

37:26.500 --> 37:28.400
of course I want him to fail.

37:28.433 --> 37:29.700
- He's already failed.
He's already failed.

37:34.734 --> 37:35.467
♪ One, two, one, two

37:35.467 --> 37:36.000
♪ One, two, one, two
one, two, drink ♪

37:37.433 --> 37:38.633
♪ Can you pour me another? ♪

37:40.400 --> 37:42.433
- Now you are
your complete true self.

37:42.467 --> 37:44.200
- I'm gonna do it slow.
We're gonna do it slow.

37:44.233 --> 37:46.000
- Like your first time
doing anal.

37:46.033 --> 37:48.066
- That's good form, Ariana.

37:48.100 --> 37:51.500
- Oh, look at that blood.
Oh, my God.

37:51.533 --> 37:54.133
- Oh!
- My God!

37:54.166 --> 37:56.367
- That's the whole thing.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.734
- It's my ----ing birthday.

37:58.767 --> 38:01.467
- Your headpiece is so sick.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.734
- I want to wear it
in real life.

38:03.767 --> 38:05.500
- You can borrow it.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.166
- Cheers!

38:07.200 --> 38:08.467
- Happy birthday, Ariana.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.200
- Raquel!
- Hi.

38:10.233 --> 38:12.433
- You look fantastic.
Thank you for coming.

38:12.467 --> 38:13.767
- I'm glad I'm here.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.100
It's a little weird
without James.

38:16.133 --> 38:18.166
- I don't know what to say
about James.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.100
- Well, just from what I heard,
it was Katie

38:20.133 --> 38:22.533
who didn't feel comfortable
with him being here.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.400
- And Brittany,
Katie and Brittany.

38:24.433 --> 38:25.767
- I think it was just too soon

38:26.000 --> 38:27.633
from the things
that had happened before.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.467
- I would love
for James to be here,

38:29.500 --> 38:31.600
but he's not
in a position now--

38:31.633 --> 38:34.500
- I mean, I wouldn't.

38:34.533 --> 38:36.500
- He hasn't drank
since that day,

38:36.533 --> 38:37.700
since that night.

38:37.734 --> 38:39.133
- It's so easy
to talk about that

38:39.166 --> 38:40.567
when you hit rock bottom

38:40.600 --> 38:42.400
and no one wants you around
anymore, though.

38:42.433 --> 38:44.066
It is so easy.

38:44.100 --> 38:46.133
- He hasn't drank
in a whole week and a half?

38:46.166 --> 38:48.400
Thank God for that.
- I agree with her.

38:51.567 --> 38:53.000
Where you want him to be,

38:53.033 --> 38:54.500
where Katie wants him to be.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.667
- Well, everyone wants him
to be a normal person,

38:56.700 --> 38:58.133
but he's not
a normal human being.

38:58.166 --> 39:00.667
- You guys are wanting him
to fail.

39:02.233 --> 39:05.000
If anyone body-shames
my best friend,

39:05.033 --> 39:07.000
of course
I want them to fail!

39:07.033 --> 39:09.266
What if he did that
to your best friend?

39:09.300 --> 39:10.533
Are you--are you--

39:10.567 --> 39:12.200
- Stassi, don't ----ing say

39:12.233 --> 39:13.667
that I'm stupid in the head.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.467
I'm not.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.533
- That's on you.

39:16.567 --> 39:18.700
You deserve so much more

39:18.734 --> 39:22.467
than someone who is
a legitimate piece of sh--.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.233
- He's not always
a piece of sh--.

39:29.533 --> 39:30.667
I totally relate to Raquel.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.500
Like, I feel her pain.

39:32.533 --> 39:34.033
I understand what it's like

39:34.066 --> 39:35.200
to be in a relationship
with somebody

39:35.233 --> 39:37.133
who's really sh----.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.133
- I did go to Vegas and have
relations with somebody else.

39:39.166 --> 39:40.567
- You're an asshole!

39:40.600 --> 39:42.133
- You're so ----ing selfish,

39:42.166 --> 39:43.667
you don't care if you're
wasting anybody else's time.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.166
You'd rather have
a pity party for yourself.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.300
- Stop always making it
about you.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.200
Pull yourself together.

39:49.233 --> 39:51.066
And you're constantly
defending him.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.300
I get Raquel.

39:52.333 --> 39:53.700
Because I'm 30,

39:53.734 --> 39:55.500
I feel like I have, like
the right--shut up--

39:55.533 --> 39:59.300
to just, like,
just give wisdom to people.

39:59.333 --> 40:02.600
- But sometimes
it's unwanted wisdom.

40:04.266 --> 40:06.533
- Okay.

40:06.567 --> 40:09.200
- God.
Take that. Take that.

40:09.233 --> 40:11.033
Take this.

40:11.066 --> 40:13.033
- Take that sh--.

40:13.066 --> 40:14.567
- Sorry, this shot
is disgusting.

40:16.233 --> 40:17.734
- I don't know what I want.

40:17.767 --> 40:19.533
Ah.

40:19.567 --> 40:21.033
- Yeah.

40:21.066 --> 40:22.500
- Louboutins.

40:22.533 --> 40:24.633
- God dang.
- Wait.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.633
- God dang!

40:26.667 --> 40:28.734
God dang.

40:28.767 --> 40:31.500
- I'm 30.
- You're 30!

40:34.567 --> 40:36.233
- This birthday, I feel

40:36.266 --> 40:38.767
so much more relaxed.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.200
And, honestly, I feel like

40:40.233 --> 40:42.767
a lot of that has to do
with Beau.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.767
He really is
the absolute best.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.700
And I just really
freaking love him.

40:48.734 --> 40:51.300
Oh, my God, do I sound like
Scheana talking about Rob?

40:51.333 --> 40:53.300
Like, this is, like,
my worst nightmare.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.133
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

41:01.133 --> 41:03.100
- I won't be home till 2:00.
- I'm trying to find Stass.

41:11.633 --> 41:13.100
- Peter's getting crazy.

41:13.133 --> 41:14.233
- Come on, Tom.

41:14.266 --> 41:15.767
- Peter, don't say, "Come on."

41:16.000 --> 41:18.133
It's like we're in a gay porn.

41:18.166 --> 41:21.667
No.

41:24.333 --> 41:27.200
- Your call has been forwarded
to a--

41:27.233 --> 41:29.100
- I just want to have Beau
with me

41:29.133 --> 41:30.533
in bed at the end of the night,

41:30.567 --> 41:31.767
because I know
everything's okay.

41:33.300 --> 41:34.734
- Your call has been--
- Okay.

41:34.767 --> 41:37.367
Whoa, whoa.

41:39.100 --> 41:40.734
- Your call
has been forwarded--

41:40.767 --> 41:42.633
Please record your message.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.300
- I've been texting you,
and I know that you read them.

41:44.333 --> 41:47.166
I just want him to be with me
and love me

41:47.200 --> 41:49.367
and just, like,
show that he loves me.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.166
- Please record your message.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.367
- You have legitimately
been ignoring me.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.200
This is bullsh--.

41:56.233 --> 41:58.000
Being left is, like,
a big deal.

41:58.033 --> 41:59.600
It kills me.

41:59.633 --> 42:02.066
It, like, really,
really kills me.

42:03.333 --> 42:05.333
- Please record your message.

42:05.367 --> 42:07.000
!

42:12.433 --> 42:14.767
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
- I am so ----ing concerned

42:18.033 --> 42:21.633
that you are going
to leave me.

42:21.667 --> 42:24.233
- It's like you dick-punched
my heart.

42:24.266 --> 42:28.200
- This is for all the boys
who've done stupid sh-- to us!

42:29.633 --> 42:31.400
Mother----ers!

42:31.433 --> 42:34.600
- You're actually down here,
and he's up here.

42:34.633 --> 42:36.233
- Mom!

42:36.266 --> 42:37.767
I'm getting annoyed.
I'm getting really annoyed.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.600
- Can everybody
stop being selfish

42:39.633 --> 42:41.033
and thinking about themselves?

42:41.066 --> 42:43.266
- This is so intense right now.

42:43.300 --> 42:45.033
- Oh, God.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.667
- With James, Tuesday
is one of our best nights

42:49.700 --> 42:51.600
because he's behind
the DJ booth.

42:51.633 --> 42:53.200
- Can I ask how many times
he's been fired?

42:53.233 --> 42:55.166
- You're lucky to be here
as well, quite frankly.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.700
- You don't have to
have me here; that's fine.

42:56.734 --> 42:58.233
- Jax, if you're gonna
talk to me like this,

42:58.266 --> 42:59.333
I'm not gonna have it.

42:59.367 --> 43:01.200
- It's your restaurant.
