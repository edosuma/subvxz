WEBVTT

00:00.068 --> 00:02.024
(Carter) Previously on
"Finding Carter"...

00:03.100 --> 00:05.580
Baby, you do not look
at all well.

00:05.580 --> 00:07.580
You didn't belong with
those people, all right?

00:07.580 --> 00:08.916
You belong with me.

00:08.916 --> 00:10.317
(Lori, echoing)
I've got it under control.

00:10.319 --> 00:11.715
You knew eventually
it would come to this.

00:11.717 --> 00:14.023
The truth has to come out.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.091
(Elizabeth)
I couldn't get pregnant.

00:16.094 --> 00:17.891
When we decided to look
for an egg donor...

00:17.893 --> 00:20.339
They chose me.
I am your real mother.

00:21.283 --> 00:22.516
That's a cop. Go!

00:22.518 --> 00:23.597
(Carter) No, please.

00:23.597 --> 00:24.763
(Grunting, struggling)

00:24.765 --> 00:25.928
Run!

00:27.344 --> 00:28.045
Ah!

00:28.045 --> 00:30.391
No matter what
we find out about us...

00:30.393 --> 00:31.615
It doesn't change anything,

00:31.617 --> 00:32.968
if that's what
you're worried about.

00:32.969 --> 00:34.231
Crash, what the hell
are you doing?

00:34.232 --> 00:35.121
The safety's on.

00:36.008 --> 00:37.136
Call 911!

00:37.137 --> 00:38.283
Oh, God.

00:38.284 --> 00:39.664
(Taylor)
Is it okay that I'm here?

00:39.664 --> 00:41.807
(Max) Yeah. But I don't
want to be apart.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.316
We had a really
great thing going.

00:43.317 --> 00:44.667
We should have it again.

00:44.668 --> 00:45.884
I would really like that.

00:45.886 --> 00:46.780
(Carter) Crash?

00:47.692 --> 00:48.835
What are you doing here?

00:48.837 --> 00:49.939
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

00:49.941 --> 00:51.076
I don't care.
I don't want to see you.

00:51.078 --> 00:52.396
I'm not here to see you.
I'm here to see Max.

00:52.396 --> 00:54.787
(Max) Crash, man, you
gotta knock it off.

00:54.789 --> 00:56.484
You're a good person.

00:56.484 --> 00:57.859
You didn't deserve what I did.

00:57.860 --> 00:58.948
Are you out of your mind?

00:58.948 --> 01:00.268
I just saw Crash drop you off.

01:00.270 --> 01:01.435
He almost killed you!

01:01.436 --> 01:03.363
- People change.
- Yeah, you must be right.

01:03.365 --> 01:05.227
Because I don't know
who you are anymore.

01:05.227 --> 01:07.129
Was there something
between you and Lori?

01:07.430 --> 01:09.436
<i>(Lori) I was having an
affair with David Wilson</i>

01:09.436 --> 01:11.371
<i>when Carter and Taylor
were a year old.</i>

01:11.373 --> 01:13.879
<i>(David) I can't tell
Elizabeth about Lori.</i>

01:13.881 --> 01:16.384
This is the lie that
is going to destroy us.

01:16.385 --> 01:18.993
If you tell her now,
she might forgive you.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.301
(David) What if your
mother can't forgive me.

01:27.909 --> 01:28.822
(David, muffled)
Elizabeth, please...

01:28.823 --> 01:30.037
<i>(Elizabeth, muffled)
How could you do this?</i>

01:30.039 --> 01:31.055
<i>(David, muffled)
Yes, I made a decision...</i>

01:31.055 --> 01:33.978
<i>A wrong decision.
I was in a bad place.</i>

01:33.979 --> 01:35.409
<i>(Elizabeth, muffled)
All these years, I trusted you.</i>

01:35.811 --> 01:37.914
- I'm so sorry.
- I can't even begin

01:37.914 --> 01:39.450
to understand any of this.

01:39.451 --> 01:41.385
I should have told you years ago.
I wanted to.

01:41.387 --> 01:43.293
You have no idea how much.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.281
How did Carter know?

01:45.283 --> 01:46.770
She confronted me.

01:46.771 --> 01:47.713
<i>(Elizabeth, muffled) With what?</i>

01:47.715 --> 01:49.361
<i>(David, muffled) My photo
from Lori's housemate.</i>

01:49.862 --> 01:53.430
I guess 13 years of Carter's life
wasn't enough for Lori.

01:54.033 --> 01:56.921
She had to take you
and Taylor from me too.

01:58.002 --> 01:59.777
She hasn't taken anyone.

01:59.778 --> 02:02.397
Taylor is your daughter.
Carter is too.

02:02.399 --> 02:03.977
<i>(David, muffled)
And I'm your husband.</i>

02:04.974 --> 02:06.093
Hey, what's going on?

02:07.390 --> 02:08.884
Oh, they're just talking.

02:09.586 --> 02:10.896
About what?

02:12.167 --> 02:13.653
I don't know,
I couldn't really hear.

02:13.655 --> 02:16.078
(David speaking indistinctly)

02:16.079 --> 02:17.141
Are you okay?

02:17.143 --> 02:18.555
What? Yeah.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.038
You look like
you've been crying.

02:20.954 --> 02:22.825
I broke up with Max.

02:22.826 --> 02:25.574
What? Why?

02:25.575 --> 02:28.430
It's just this whole
Crash thing.

02:28.431 --> 02:29.949
You know, I... I get it.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.978
I get that Max is a nice guy.

02:32.813 --> 02:36.265
But... some things
are just unforgivable.

02:36.266 --> 02:38.718
I mean, does everybody just
get to do whatever they want

02:38.718 --> 02:40.971
and then it's just
supposed to be okay?

02:40.972 --> 02:44.401
Tay, you're both going
through so much right now.

02:45.394 --> 02:47.514
Do you really think now
is the time to break up?

02:47.514 --> 02:48.961
I was ready to give up

02:48.962 --> 02:51.241
everything for Max
when he got shot.

02:51.242 --> 02:53.930
I mean, school, my future.

02:53.930 --> 02:55.569
And now it seems like...

02:55.570 --> 02:58.241
Forgiving Crash is more
important to him than I am.

02:58.242 --> 02:59.509
- (Muffled arguing continues)
- That's not true.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.299
Well, Max is fine with it, so...

03:01.300 --> 03:02.794
Yeah, because he's Max.

03:03.294 --> 03:05.423
That's not how he really
feels, though.

03:05.424 --> 03:07.990
- How do you know?
- Because I do, Tay.

03:08.290 --> 03:11.253
We're best friends.
I know how much he cares about you.

03:11.254 --> 03:12.861
<i>(Elizabeth, muffled)
You should have told me first!</i>

03:12.862 --> 03:14.686
<i>(David, muffled) Oh, don't
you think I know that?</i>

03:14.687 --> 03:16.454
Okay, that sounds like a fight.

03:16.455 --> 03:17.871
Well...

03:19.397 --> 03:21.007
People fight.

03:21.008 --> 03:23.199
Doesn't mean
you have to break up.

03:25.031 --> 03:27.069
I don't really want
to talk about this.

Why did you sleep with her?

03:42.264 --> 03:44.003
We had two little babies.

03:44.004 --> 03:45.235
I don't know.

03:45.236 --> 03:46.671
I don't.

03:47.073 --> 03:48.968
We were having problems...

03:49.472 --> 03:51.343
If I could go back
and change it, Liz,

03:51.344 --> 03:53.288
I swear, I would.

03:53.288 --> 03:55.240
It's not like I don't get it.

03:56.231 --> 03:58.304
The loneliness you felt,
the sadness.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.824
I was there, and you forgave me.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.487
It's not about an indiscretion.

04:03.489 --> 04:05.711
It's about what it turned into.

04:07.472 --> 04:08.824
The horror.

04:10.224 --> 04:12.068
She stole our daughter.

04:12.069 --> 04:13.501
If I'd known how sick she was,

04:13.901 --> 04:15.477
you have to know, Liz,

04:15.478 --> 04:16.548
if I thought for a minute

04:16.548 --> 04:19.329
she would ever have done what she did,
I would have stopped her.

04:19.329 --> 04:20.612
I would have told you
then and there.

04:20.612 --> 04:22.564
When Carter went missing, you didn't.
You didn't say a word.

04:22.565 --> 04:25.036
It was two years later. I didn't
know there was a connection.

04:25.038 --> 04:27.244
But when they found her
and you knew who took her...

04:27.245 --> 04:29.668
I thought this was my fault.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.495
I'm responsible
for Carter's kidnapping.

(Knocking at door)

05:09.192 --> 05:09.809
Yeah.

05:11.696 --> 05:13.047
- Oh, hey, buddy.
- Good morning.

05:13.048 --> 05:14.708
I'm supposed to get Carter.

05:16.036 --> 05:17.451
Hey.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.627
Sorry, we were up late talking.

05:19.629 --> 05:21.276
Family meeting
in the living room.

05:22.307 --> 05:23.531
- About what?
- Who knows?

05:23.533 --> 05:25.548
But I'm not
getting a "Hey, kids!,

05:25.548 --> 05:27.507
we're going to Disneyland"
vibe out of it.

05:30.404 --> 05:32.163
(Sighing)

05:32.564 --> 05:34.874
- They're getting divorced.
- You don't know that.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.582
- Yes, I do.
- Nothing is certain.

05:37.584 --> 05:39.168
This is all my fault.

05:39.569 --> 05:41.711
I should have made him go
to Elizabeth sooner.

05:41.713 --> 05:42.855
It's not your fault.

05:43.156 --> 05:45.276
What did you think when
your parents got divorced?

05:45.576 --> 05:47.127
I thought it was my fault.

05:48.620 --> 05:51.244
Look, maybe they'll break up,
maybe they won't.

05:51.845 --> 05:53.468
But it's not yours to fix.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.148
No. I can fix this.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.988
I do love your enthusiasm.

06:01.723 --> 06:03.139
You're not going anywhere.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.204
You and Taylor
are gonna fix this.

06:05.204 --> 06:07.468
Carter, I'm dumped.
Okay, I'm done.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.360
I've gotta pack up,
get my truck fixed.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.372
Head back to Pennsylvania.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.528
Max, please be here when
I get home from school.

06:19.944 --> 06:20.896
(Carter) I'm coming!

06:20.896 --> 06:22.447
Sorry, sorry. I'm here.

06:23.949 --> 06:25.310
Okay.

06:28.769 --> 06:31.608
Your mom and I wanted
to talk to you as soon as possible.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.552
It's probably not a big shock.

06:33.553 --> 06:36.761
Your mom and I,
we've been having problems.

06:36.762 --> 06:40.079
And, uh, in order to deal
with these problems,

06:40.081 --> 06:42.168
we think it's best...

06:45.334 --> 06:46.396
What?

06:46.396 --> 06:48.483
Your father and I
are separating.

06:51.387 --> 06:54.172
Separating... what,
like living apart?

06:55.740 --> 06:57.451
- Yeah.
- Why?

06:57.452 --> 06:58.651
We've been through a lot,

06:58.653 --> 07:00.348
and we just need some time.

07:00.348 --> 07:02.795
- For what?
- It's very complicated.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.213
But you're not getting
divorced, right?

07:04.213 --> 07:06.732
No. Definitely not. At least...

07:09.052 --> 07:10.644
Neither of us wants that.

07:10.644 --> 07:12.708
I don't... I don't understand.

07:12.709 --> 07:14.656
Honey, we... we just have
some stuff

07:14.656 --> 07:16.401
that we need to work through.

07:16.401 --> 07:18.185
But we love each other
very much.

07:18.185 --> 07:20.879
And, uh... we hope everything

07:21.336 --> 07:23.625
will go back to normal,
really soon.

07:23.625 --> 07:24.944
Are we moving?

07:24.944 --> 07:26.432
No, you are staying here.

07:26.432 --> 07:28.088
Are you leaving?

07:28.088 --> 07:30.255
We are gonna take turns
sleeping here,

07:30.257 --> 07:32.699
so when I'm not here,

07:32.701 --> 07:34.795
I'll probably stay at my office.

07:34.797 --> 07:36.531
And your mom...

07:36.533 --> 07:39.026
I don't know. Grandma's?

07:39.526 --> 07:42.718
Isn't grandma and grandpa's
anniversary party tonight?

07:44.250 --> 07:46.064
- I forgot.
- Yeah, so did I.

07:47.185 --> 07:48.819
Grandma has this
friend flying in

07:48.819 --> 07:50.579
that she wants me to meet.

07:50.579 --> 07:51.742
Who's that?

07:51.742 --> 07:53.886
She's the Dean of Admissions
at Stanford.

07:53.887 --> 07:55.990
I mean, I know that
it's selfish, but...

07:55.990 --> 07:57.766
No, it's not selfish. We'll go.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.358
Just the two of you?

08:01.005 --> 08:04.062
No. No, come on,
we should all go.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.069
Dad too.

08:08.119 --> 08:09.319
I'd like that.

08:11.230 --> 08:13.406
Great. So, on the anniversary

08:13.408 --> 08:15.557
of my parents' marriage,
I have to tell them that...

08:15.559 --> 08:17.646
Mom, you don't have to
tell them anything.

08:19.014 --> 08:20.389
So, lie?

08:20.391 --> 08:22.557
It's just a lie of omission.

08:22.559 --> 08:24.134
And, you're okay with that?

08:25.661 --> 08:28.077
I'm learning that some things
are better kept private, yeah.

08:30.783 --> 08:31.870
Okay, fine.

08:33.335 --> 08:35.287
Cocktails at 7:00.

08:36.388 --> 08:38.278
(School bell ringing)

08:38.951 --> 08:40.754
- Carter! Wait!
- Hey.

08:41.155 --> 08:43.047
Why are mom and dad separating?

08:44.250 --> 08:46.523
You heard them, Tay.
They have problems.

08:46.524 --> 08:48.222
Okay, what problems?

08:48.224 --> 08:49.690
I mean, you heard them
last night.

08:49.691 --> 08:51.713
Is it Kyle, or something
that Lori did?

08:51.715 --> 08:53.019
I don't know, Tay. I told you

08:53.019 --> 08:54.331
I couldn't really hear
what they were saying.

08:54.331 --> 08:56.754
Look... I don't understand
any of this.

08:56.755 --> 08:58.187
I mean, we just got
our family back together.

08:58.187 --> 09:00.259
The woman who kidnapped you
is in jail.

09:00.659 --> 09:04.003
We should be happy, but now
mom and dad are separating,

09:04.763 --> 09:06.859
and you don't seem
the least bit surprised.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.826
Or pissed off.

09:08.827 --> 09:11.168
I mean, is there something
that you're not telling me?

09:12.654 --> 09:14.014
(Cell phone ringing)

09:16.859 --> 09:18.034
Who's number is this?

09:18.036 --> 09:19.139
(Ringing continues)

09:19.139 --> 09:20.294
<i>(Woman on phone)
You have a call from...</i>

09:20.296 --> 09:23.110
<i>Lori Stevens... at the Central
County Correctional Facility.</i>

09:23.111 --> 09:24.038
- It's Lori.
- What?

09:24.039 --> 09:25.246
<i>Please press one to accept.</i>

09:25.248 --> 09:26.629
- She's calling from County.
- Oh, my God.

09:26.630 --> 09:28.379
Well, what did she say?

09:28.855 --> 09:30.962
I don't know, it was
a recorded message...

09:31.407 --> 09:32.899
Saying "press one 1
to accept" the call.

09:32.899 --> 09:33.931
Don't.

09:36.482 --> 09:37.650
(Phone beeps)

09:39.379 --> 09:40.778
Look, I have to get to class.

09:45.221 --> 09:46.116
Okay.

09:47.284 --> 09:48.341
Let's go.

09:48.341 --> 09:50.196
I can't go to the party tonight.

09:51.897 --> 09:53.105
(Door closing)

09:56.900 --> 09:57.972
I get it.

09:57.974 --> 09:59.980
The next few weeks
are gonna be hard.

10:00.381 --> 10:01.899
But everything is gonna be okay.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.581
Well, my suit doesn't fit,

10:03.581 --> 10:05.373
and the Country Club
won't let me in

10:05.374 --> 10:06.780
if I'm not wearing a suit.

10:06.782 --> 10:09.107
Is that why
you can't go tonight?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.236
I told you three months ago.

10:11.238 --> 10:12.644
Yep, you did.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.188
Sorry.

10:14.190 --> 10:15.565
All right, um...

10:17.157 --> 10:19.732
You can skip school,
come with me to work,

10:19.734 --> 10:23.485
and after my class we will
go buy you a suit.

10:32.782 --> 10:34.321
Blown head gasket.

10:34.322 --> 10:36.500
I think the brakes are shot too.

10:36.501 --> 10:38.456
Looks like a couple thousand
dollars worth of work.

10:38.457 --> 10:39.600
And, uh...

10:41.561 --> 10:42.600
Yeah, you need new tires.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.600
I'll take care of it.

10:47.601 --> 10:48.952
Yeah, I can pay in installments,

10:48.953 --> 10:50.216
I just... I need to get home.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.081
- What about rehab?
- It's gonna have to wait.

10:52.081 --> 10:54.904
Stay here. Get your own place.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.465
Dude, I don't have any cash.

10:56.466 --> 10:58.057

- No, no, really.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.732
Hey, at least let me
drop you off at Carter's

11:12.734 --> 11:14.448
until your truck gets fixed.

11:15.589 --> 11:16.908
That I will take you up on.

11:19.828 --> 11:20.844
Hey.

11:20.845 --> 11:22.332
Hey.

11:26.557 --> 11:28.109
I don't know if I can do this.

11:30.155 --> 11:31.325

how painful this must be.

11:47.225 --> 11:48.729
I can't.

11:49.657 --> 11:51.945
But I know dad loves you.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.256
So much.

11:54.857 --> 11:56.817
Please, can you try
and remember that?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.352
I'm trying, baby.

11:58.354 --> 12:01.232
It just... it doesn't seem
like enough right now.

12:01.234 --> 12:03.105
Her face, everything
that she said,

12:03.105 --> 12:06.745
I just ca... I can't
stop thinking about it.

12:08.389 --> 12:09.908
I have to go through
every minute of our lives

12:09.909 --> 12:11.605
and try to figure it out.

12:13.852 --> 12:15.100
I just...

12:17.244 --> 12:19.164
I feel alone.

12:19.166 --> 12:20.590
Mom...

12:22.284 --> 12:24.812
I'm here.
(Laughs, cries, sniffles)

12:25.337 --> 12:27.139
- We're all still here.
- I know.

12:27.139 --> 12:29.554
Thank you. I know.

12:29.556 --> 12:31.866
It doesn't matter
what she said in that room.

12:32.268 --> 12:33.850
Okay, she's Lori.

12:34.995 --> 12:37.890
She knew you were listening.
She was manipulating you.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.929
It's what she does.

12:40.331 --> 12:44.553
But we can't let her
ruin us, okay?

12:45.254 --> 12:46.790
She doesn't get to win.

12:49.147 --> 12:50.754
You're right.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.787
Again.

12:54.761 --> 12:55.815
Okay.

12:57.312 --> 12:58.501
Okay...

12:58.503 --> 13:00.096
What about this one?

13:01.399 --> 13:02.647
What's wrong with that one?

13:02.648 --> 13:04.255
Yeah.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.501
Yeah!

13:09.629 --> 13:10.815
No.

13:10.816 --> 13:12.837
- No?
- I need to go shopping.

13:13.239 --> 13:15.422
We should go shopping.
You guys need anything?

13:15.423 --> 13:17.342
Uh, yeah, okay. Um...

13:17.744 --> 13:19.385
I don't think Taylor's home yet.

13:20.551 --> 13:21.779
Oh. Have you talked to her?

13:21.780 --> 13:22.899
How is she doing?

13:22.899 --> 13:24.403
Not good.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.746
Did you know she and Max
broke up last night?

13:26.748 --> 13:28.938
(Car approaching)

13:28.940 --> 13:30.009
Is that her?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.754
Oh, okay, cool.
I'll get my purse.

13:31.755 --> 13:33.357
Unbelievable.

13:33.359 --> 13:34.221
What?

13:34.222 --> 13:35.735
What's going on around here?

13:39.933 --> 13:40.717
- You got it?
- Yeah.

(Elizabeth) Hey!

13:45.275 --> 13:46.479
Get out of here!

13:46.480 --> 13:47.838
He was just dropping me off.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.298

detective Wilson...

13:49.299 --> 13:50.486
Save it!

13:50.488 --> 13:53.322
And congratulations on
escaping justice... again!

13:53.322 --> 13:54.818
But you're not welcome
in my house.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.879
And you're not
allowed near my family.

14:00.955 --> 14:02.211
You need to go.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.236
All right.

14:14.749 --> 14:15.854
Thank you for the ride.

14:16.405 --> 14:17.830
- Hmm.
- You, inside.

14:18.534 --> 14:19.975
- I'll be right in.
- Carter!

14:19.975 --> 14:21.527
Mom, please.

14:26.070 --> 14:28.979
- Why did you come here?
- It's what Max said.

14:28.980 --> 14:31.143
Okay, why couldn't you
drop him off a block away?

14:32.027 --> 14:34.043
Because then there would
be no chance of seeing you.

14:36.947 --> 14:38.219
I'm sorry I upset your mom.

14:41.095 --> 14:42.861
Yeah, well, you're not
the only upsetting thing

14:42.863 --> 14:44.767
that's been happening
around here recently.

14:45.168 --> 14:47.003
I... I won't come back.

14:47.004 --> 14:49.580
Or to school, or to Bird's...

14:50.730 --> 14:52.169
If that's what you want.

14:54.730 --> 14:56.602
Is that what you want?

14:59.796 --> 15:01.058
You know, I have a lot of...

15:01.955 --> 15:03.172
Really serious stuff going on

15:03.173 --> 15:04.235
with my family right now.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.610
We're not hanging out.

15:14.912 --> 15:16.615
Is he the reason why
you two broke up?

15:17.599 --> 15:19.166
Part of it, yes.

15:19.167 --> 15:21.213
And he's worth losing her over?

15:21.215 --> 15:23.590
No, but he's not worth
me walking around

15:23.591 --> 15:25.080
the rest of my life hating him.

15:25.081 --> 15:29.006
Max... he almost killed you.

15:29.008 --> 15:30.654
He made a mistake.

15:30.655 --> 15:32.230
Don't do that.
Don't trivialize it.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.678
I'm not.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.927
I just want to forgive him...

15:38.509 --> 15:39.885
And move on.

15:41.923 --> 15:43.601
Sorry. Class went long.

15:44.003 --> 15:47.067
All right, just one more thing
to take care of.

15:48.091 --> 15:49.162
Hilary, this is my son.

15:49.163 --> 15:50.355

- Cool.
- The department meeting is now.

15:54.967 --> 15:55.990
I'm supposed to remind you.

15:55.991 --> 15:57.088
- Oh, I can't make it.
- Oh.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.256
Professor Martin specifically
asked about you.

15:59.258 --> 16:02.629
Well, just tell Professor Martin
whatever you have to.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.769
Grant and I are having
a father-son day.

16:05.620 --> 16:06.797
I'll say that you ate
the Chicken Kiev

16:06.798 --> 16:08.500
in the cafeteria
and you had to leave.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.246

See you tomorrow.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.837
Yeah, see ya. Bye.

16:16.761 --> 16:17.831
All right?

16:20.096 --> 16:21.081
Come on.

16:22.696 --> 16:23.712
What are we doing in here?

16:25.048 --> 16:26.144
Just trust me.

16:33.965 --> 16:36.461
- Pick a suit.
- For what?

16:36.461 --> 16:37.893
My grandparents' party
is tonight.

16:37.894 --> 16:39.476
I'm not going to that.

16:39.477 --> 16:41.566
- Yes you are, Max.
- What about Taylor?

16:41.567 --> 16:43.316
Yeah, Taylor will be there too.

We want you there.

16:49.783 --> 16:52.172
- My grandma wants you there!
- Yeah, but Taylor...

16:52.173 --> 16:54.428
Taylor is gonna have some
Stanford person with her.

16:54.429 --> 16:55.996
She'll be in a really good mood.

16:55.998 --> 16:58.188
- It could be really good timing.
- For what?

16:58.190 --> 16:59.945
Max, you love her.

16:59.946 --> 17:01.400
That's not the problem.

17:01.402 --> 17:02.624
Don't you still love her?

17:03.616 --> 17:04.904
I'm not sure that she loves me.

17:05.204 --> 17:06.786
Okay, well, how are
you gonna find out

17:06.787 --> 17:08.489
if you go back to Pennsylvania?

17:09.778 --> 17:11.800
Max, you two are
so good together.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.673
Okay? I get that you've
both got a lot going on.

17:14.673 --> 17:16.896
But if you can't make a
relationship work right now,

17:16.896 --> 17:19.694
can you please at least try
and still be friends?

You and mom

- What are you guys doing here?

18:14.163 --> 18:16.186
Grant grew out of his suit.

18:16.188 --> 18:18.163
Well, you should have told me.
I could have taken him.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.050
No, no, I don't mind.
I'm happy to do it.

18:24.986 --> 18:27.098

the video games.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.106
Grant's feeling...

18:29.107 --> 18:31.420
He needs to know
I'm not going anywhere.

18:31.421 --> 18:33.603
I'm not trying to force you
out of the family, David.

18:33.604 --> 18:35.619
I didn't say that.
I just want to reassure him.

18:35.621 --> 18:36.866
I just don't want Grant to think

18:36.867 --> 18:38.086

I should slut it up.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.546
So, you wear it with a sweater.

18:55.547 --> 18:56.983
Then after your meeting
with the Stanford lady,

18:56.984 --> 18:58.489
then you can slut it up.

19:03.334 --> 19:05.237
- What?
- (Carter sighing)

19:05.238 --> 19:06.844
She tried to call me
earlier as well.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.740
- When?
- When I was at school.

19:11.060 --> 19:12.252
Why is she calling me?

19:12.253 --> 19:13.588
Because I hung up on her?

19:13.589 --> 19:14.924
How did she get Taylor's number?

19:14.925 --> 19:16.256
(Carter) I don't know.

19:16.257 --> 19:18.832
Maybe she looked through
my phone when I was passed out?

19:18.833 --> 19:20.217
Well, this just gets
better and better.

19:20.218 --> 19:23.045
I'm calling the Warden
to file a complaint.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.472
Yeah, and we should change
the girls' phone numbers.

19:27.575 --> 19:29.037
No, you know what,
it's fine, I got it.

19:29.038 --> 19:31.195
- What are you doing?
- Blocking her number.

19:31.196 --> 19:32.709
Do you think
that's gonna stop her?

19:33.932 --> 19:35.564
Why can't she
just leave us alone?

19:36.685 --> 19:38.005
What does she want with us?

19:51.957 --> 19:52.836
(Carter) Oh.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.616
(Taylor) Wow, they've
really gone all out.

20:04.396 --> 20:06.820

- Yeah.

20:06.821 --> 20:08.229
Grandma's crazy about Max.

20:08.230 --> 20:10.076
Well, grandma's not
his girlfriend.

20:10.077 --> 20:13.257

20:29.367 --> 20:30.968
Stanford.

Environmental Studies

20:51.675 --> 20:53.747
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:00.925 --> 21:02.580

21:02.582 --> 21:03.820
David, you're, um...

21:03.821 --> 21:05.509
I'm next to Buddy.

21:05.509 --> 21:07.025
Ah, yes, you are.

21:07.026 --> 21:09.401
Okay, picture on three.
One, two... ah!

21:09.402 --> 21:11.121
- Good.
- Okay, one more for safety.

21:11.122 --> 21:12.673
And girls,
can you just switch places?

21:12.673 --> 21:14.832
- Okay, grandma.
- What difference does it make?

21:14.833 --> 21:17.664
(Buddy) I find it
best not to argue.

21:17.665 --> 21:19.593
Smile, everybody. Show teeth!

21:19.594 --> 21:20.944
One more for safety.

21:20.945 --> 21:22.409
I thought that was the safety?

21:22.410 --> 21:23.680
Mom, enough.

21:25.505 --> 21:26.416
Something going on?

21:27.313 --> 21:29.249
Joan, why don't you do one
with just the women?

21:29.250 --> 21:30.544
Sounds good to me.

21:30.545 --> 21:32.252
Can you not direct,
please, David?

21:32.253 --> 21:33.532
That's her job.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.136
Well, actually, grandma
has something else

21:35.137 --> 21:36.916
- to do with the girls.
- Okay.

21:39.133 --> 21:40.717
Have you spoken to Max yet?

21:41.452 --> 21:42.500
Why would I talk to him?

21:43.613 --> 21:45.436
Taylor, do you really
think right now is

21:45.438 --> 21:46.924
the best time
to break up with someone

21:46.925 --> 21:48.601
that you care so much about?

21:48.602 --> 21:50.955
Carter, leave it alone.

21:52.684 --> 21:54.325
Girls, I want you to meet
my friend, Anne Wallace.

21:54.326 --> 21:55.788
- Hi.
- This is my granddaughter, Taylor.

21:55.788 --> 21:58.164
- My granddaughter, Carter.
- Hi.

21:58.165 --> 22:00.076
So, this is Carter.
Nice to meet you.

22:00.076 --> 22:02.964
Oh, hi.
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

22:03.461 --> 22:05.344
So, grandma says that you guys
went to school together?

22:05.345 --> 22:06.729
And I never left.

22:06.730 --> 22:08.136
Anne is the Dean of Admissions.

22:08.137 --> 22:10.520
Oh. Um, yeah, we heard.

22:10.521 --> 22:11.792
(Joan) So, I need to go back up.

22:11.794 --> 22:13.884
- You be good to my granddaughters.
- Okay.

22:17.121 --> 22:19.791
So, uh... did you fly out
just for the party?

22:19.792 --> 22:21.528
I did. And you should fly out

22:21.529 --> 22:22.881
to California sometime.

22:22.882 --> 22:24.457
I'd be happy to arrange
a campus tour.

22:24.458 --> 22:25.778
I would love that.

22:25.778 --> 22:28.144
I'm applying to Stanford
for Environmental Studies

22:28.144 --> 22:29.769
with a Minor in Economics.

22:29.769 --> 22:30.857
Excellent.

22:33.209 --> 22:34.161
Yeah, I think that...

22:34.162 --> 22:36.319
Conservation is really
our only hope.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.661
But, we need to develop
the technologies and...

22:41.723 --> 22:43.229
You know, find a way
to market them.

22:43.230 --> 22:44.980
Well, you've given this
a lot of thought.

22:44.981 --> 22:46.429
What about you?

22:46.430 --> 22:48.115
Me?

22:48.116 --> 22:49.924
Where do you see yourself
going to school?

22:50.717 --> 22:52.148
Oh. (Scoffing) I don't know.

22:52.150 --> 22:54.125
Um, Taylor's the smart one.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.388
She's got like a 4.0 GPA.

22:56.390 --> 22:58.020
Well, you should think
about Stanford too.

22:59.721 --> 23:00.548
Why?

23:00.549 --> 23:02.292
Because you have
an amazing story.

23:02.294 --> 23:04.125
Life experience.

23:04.125 --> 23:07.472
Your grandmother said you'd
been missing for 13 years?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.856
Well, I mean, you know...

23:10.857 --> 23:12.537
- I knew where I was.
- Well, we've had some

23:12.538 --> 23:14.025
amazing women come through
our school.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.290
Each with a perspective
all their own.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.637
Sally Ride, Sandra Day O'Connor,
your grandmother...

23:18.638 --> 23:19.788
Yeah, and, uh... hopefully

23:19.788 --> 23:20.757
my sister one day, too.

23:20.758 --> 23:23.021
Yes, Taylor, you're
an excellent candidate.

23:23.977 --> 23:26.608
Can I have someone
from our admissions team give you a call?

23:28.744 --> 23:30.472
It was so nice to meet you.

23:30.473 --> 23:31.593
You too, dear.

23:31.594 --> 23:32.960
Taylor, where are you going?

23:32.961 --> 23:34.712
Have a great night.

23:34.713 --> 23:37.653
I'm giving you
an opportunity here.

23:38.457 --> 23:40.593
I want you to think
about your future.

23:41.633 --> 23:44.040
Yeah, well...
Seems like the most

You never liked him.
You call him a loser.

24:44.153 --> 24:45.607
Well, I shouldn't say that.

24:45.608 --> 24:47.170
Why was I worried
about telling you?

24:47.171 --> 24:48.544
This is probably
the best anniversary present

you to be reasonable.

talked to a lawyer?

25:00.887 --> 25:02.990
- I'm not talking to a lawyer.
- I'm just talk...

25:02.990 --> 25:04.301
I'm thinking about
the kids, you know.

- (Buddy) No need.

I get it.
A boring adult party, right?

27:20.484 --> 27:22.355
Grant, I just heard
a security guard

27:22.356 --> 27:25.518
talking about some kids
racing golf carts on the back green.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.564
Why don't you take
grandpa's cart?

27:27.565 --> 27:29.148

- Hmm?
- Really?

27:31.670 --> 27:32.717
Sure.

27:32.718 --> 27:34.125
- Cool.
- Come on.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.364
I'll show you how
to be a winner.

27:37.599 --> 27:41.057
Thanks, Joan
he's been... grumpy today.

27:41.057 --> 27:42.361
Yeah, I noticed.

27:42.362 --> 27:45.048
He probably does need
to blow off a little steam.

27:45.048 --> 27:46.552
That's what golf carts are for.

27:46.554 --> 27:47.777
Well, thank you.

27:47.778 --> 27:50.304
It's nothing you wouldn't
have done, eventually.

27:50.305 --> 27:52.313
You know, don't you?

27:52.314 --> 27:53.847
Of course.

27:54.249 --> 27:56.545
I really appreciate
you showing up tonight.

27:56.546 --> 27:59.017

been easy.

28:05.929 --> 28:07.326

28:07.845 --> 28:09.566
Here, put this on.

28:14.813 --> 28:15.941
Oh, no, no, no.

28:15.942 --> 28:18.924
I can't sit.
Sitting makes me sleepy.

28:18.925 --> 28:20.910
I'm gonna stand.

28:22.588 --> 28:24.246

28:36.679 --> 28:38.008
