04:00.157 --> 04:01.992
[men] Luke!

04:02.909 --> 04:04.786
Luke!

04:04.911 --> 04:06.246
Luke!

04:06.371 --> 04:09.875
-So what actually happened?
-He just fell off a precipice.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.377
One minute we were standing there,
the next he wasn't there anymore.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.546
Yeah, he drank too much
at the wedding.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.507
-[David] Luke!
-[Tom] Luke!

04:17.632 --> 04:18.884
[Graham] Luke!

04:19.426 --> 04:20.969
[David] It was such a big fall.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.138
Do you think there's any chance
he could've survived it?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.849
-Yeah, course.
-[David] Oh, great.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.894
A chance in a million,
it's still a chance.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.979
[man] Hello!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.522
Shh.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.608
[man] Hello!

04:34.733 --> 04:35.901
Hello!

04:36.026 --> 04:37.235
-That's Luke.
-It's Luke.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.945
-Luke!
-Luke!

04:39.070 --> 04:40.614
-Luke!
-Luke!

04:41.656 --> 04:43.909
Oh, my God. You made it!

04:44.034 --> 04:46.828
-How did you even survive that?
-I know.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.915
I fell through the trees up there.
They must have broken my fall.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.124
Are you OK?

04:51.249 --> 04:54.628
Yeah, my arm hurts a bit,
but otherwise, yeah, I'm fine.

04:54.753 --> 04:55.796
[laughs]

04:57.047 --> 04:58.799
I must be the luckiest man alive!

04:58.924 --> 05:01.218
Oh, God!

05:05.055 --> 05:07.682
He's definitely dead now.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.685
[dramatic music]

05:20.403 --> 05:24.241
Perhaps you, er... you guys would like
to spend a few minutes with him?

05:24.366 --> 05:27.285
That'd be good, thanks.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.213
[cat miaowing]

05:38.338 --> 05:41.091
[dogs barking]

05:47.847 --> 05:51.017
-I'll leave you to it.
-Thanks.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.818
[sighs]

05:59.943 --> 06:01.486
Jesus!

06:01.611 --> 06:03.613
I can't believe he's gone.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.325
One second he was there talking to us,
and the next he's...

06:08.201 --> 06:09.828
got a massive boner.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.205
-What?
-Look at that thing.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.083
OK, keep your voice down.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.670
Wow!

06:18.795 --> 06:20.922
Why has he got a boner?
He shouldn't have a boner.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.009
Do you think that vet
was touching him up just now?

06:24.134 --> 06:25.760
[dog barks]

06:25.885 --> 06:28.179
You know, I actually think I've heard
of this happening with dead bodies.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.681
They get a <i><font color="white">rigor mortis</font></i> erection.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.058
[David] Maybe we should try
and get rid of it.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.519
I don't really want everyone
coming in and seeing that.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.146
Why not? It's not like
he's going to care, is he?

06:36.271 --> 06:38.481
Luke's our friend, Tom.
He's just died.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.859
The least we can do
is afford him a bit of dignity

06:40.984 --> 06:44.362
and not have his erect nob on display
for the whole world to see.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.157
-How are we going to get rid of it?
-I don't know.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.784
Well, maybe one of us
should try pushing it down.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.786
Yeah.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.788
I'm not touching it.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.790
What difference does it make?
He's not gonna know.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.294
But I'll know. I have got a very
strict policy about touching penises,

06:59.419 --> 07:00.712
especially erect ones.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.049
-If it's so easy why don't you do it?
-OK, fine.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.637
[dramatic music]

07:11.473 --> 07:13.934
-No, I can't do it.
-Look, just massage around it.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.394
That should re-calibrate the pressure
away from the penis,

07:16.519 --> 07:19.230
-bring it down that way.
-OK, move out of the way.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.863
[dog barks]

07:28.907 --> 07:31.534
That looks bloody weird.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.662
Thanks, Tom, that helps a lot.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.624
Don't actually think it's working.
I think it's getting stiffer.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.668
Shit, you're right.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.879
Graham, grab that book.
Try giving it a whack.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.423
-Really?
-[David] Yeah.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.972
-What, just twat it?
-Yes.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.307
[dramatic music]

07:56.393 --> 07:58.853
Put some backbone into it.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.106
Alright.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.232
[grunts]

08:11.783 --> 08:14.494
Fuck, this is no good.
Let's try holding him upside down.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.287
Maybe the blood will drain
away from his cock.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.581
-Good idea.
-Go.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.586
This isn't working.
Why isn't it working?

08:23.712 --> 08:26.339
I'll try the book.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.890
[clears throat]

08:41.438 --> 08:43.148
He's got a boner.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.525
I mean, it wasn't like
we gave him the erection.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.820
It just sort of sprang up.
We were trying to get rid of it.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.488
Well, I'm afraid that someone

08:50.613 --> 08:52.824
is gonna have to call
the next of kin and let them know.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.077
-About the boner?
-About the death.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.413
Oh! Yes, of course.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.206
Obviously, you're absolutely right.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.751
Sorry, my mind's just, uh...

09:03.793 --> 09:06.796
Tom, would you like to do it?

09:07.839 --> 09:10.008
-No, thanks.
-Why not?

09:10.133 --> 09:11.468
Er... same reason you don't want to.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.762
Because it's a shitty job
and his aunt's stone deaf.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.555
Maybe Henry will answer the phone.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.475
Mad Cousin Henry? That's even worse.
Every time I see that psychopath,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.268
he threatens
to put his prison mates on me.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.228
-He does that to me as well.
-Me too.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.689
[David] OK, well he hates all of us.
So who's gonna make the call?

09:24.814 --> 09:26.566
Well, it should probably be the one
who was closest to Luke.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.526
-Thank you.
-And that was you.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.863
That's not true at all. You and him
were just as close as we were.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.032
-Plus, you had that special connection.
-What special connection?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.742
-You totally had a special connection.
-Bollocks.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.494
Anyway, it was Graham
who was always going on

09:37.619 --> 09:40.038
-saying they were best friends.
-When we were younger maybe,

09:40.163 --> 09:41.873
but we drifted apart
over the last couple of years.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.541
-No, you fucking didn't.
-Yes, we did!

09:43.666 --> 09:44.751
-You fucking didn't.
-Yes, we did.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.960
-No, you did not.
-Yes, we did.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.922
I didn't even like him
that much towards the end.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.096
OK, this is getting embarrassing.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.389
We're just gonna have to do
a thumbs up, thumbs down thing.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.016
The odd one out makes the call.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.393
No, I always lose
at thumbs up, thumbs down.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.396
It's a one in three chance, Graham.
Just do it.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.482
Fine.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.442
[all] One, two, three.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.112
One, two, three.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.657
-One, two, three.
-Fuck it!

10:18.993 --> 10:22.956
Massive rock, a massive rock.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.416
No, no, it's Graham.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.962
No, Graham's alive, Luke's dead.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.881
Yes! Ye...

10:32.799 --> 10:35.343
Yes, your nephew is dead.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.555
No, he died.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.641
D-E-A-D, dead.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.061
No, no, don't put Henry
on the phone.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.524
No, no! Don't put Henry
on the phone.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.027
He wants to speak to you.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.950
[bells ringing]

11:00.869 --> 11:05.623
[Henry] David, is it true
what Graham just told me?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.917
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.545
It's just the worst thing
that could've possibly happened.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.883
-How's your mum?
-Oh, she's in pieces.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.429
Keeps saying she wants to see him.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.764
How soon can you get
the body back to London?

11:21.890 --> 11:23.349
I don't know.
We'll get him back as soon as we can.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.310
Whose fault was this?

11:25.852 --> 11:29.147
What? No, it wasn't anyone's fault.
It was a total accident.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.900
<i><font color="white">I know what a bunch</font></i>
<i><font color="white">of fucking idiots you lot are.</font></i>

11:32.025 --> 11:34.402
<i><font color="white">I've always told him</font></i>
<i><font color="white">he should cut you all loose.</font></i>

11:34.527 --> 11:37.030
So, I'm holding you personally
responsible for this, David.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.323
Me, why me?

11:38.448 --> 11:40.992
<i><font color="white">He was only down there</font></i>
<i><font color="white">because of your wedding!</font></i>

11:42.118 --> 11:44.162
You were the one
that dragged him down there!

11:44.287 --> 11:45.663
You're the one
that got him killed!

11:45.788 --> 11:49.375
And you're the one that's going
to bring him back in one piece!

11:50.001 --> 11:52.128
I will, I'll bring him back
in one piece.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.713
<i><font color="white">Good.</font></i>

11:55.632 --> 11:58.885
Cos if you don't,
I'm gonna fuck you, David.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.930
I'm going to fuck you harder
than you've ever been fucked before.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.264
Do you understand me?

12:05.183 --> 12:07.143
Yeah, I understand.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.103
Good.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.113
We need to get Luke back to London
as soon as possible.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.659
-[Graham] How's Mia doing?
-[David] She's been better.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.828
Poor thing. One minute she's
getting ready for her honeymoon,

12:25.954 --> 12:27.288
the next you're off to London.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.916
I know, luckily Mia
is a very understanding person.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.459
Well, she must be,

12:31.584 --> 12:34.754
especially as she got her dad to agree
to us taking his corporate jet.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.966
-How was he about that?
-Not as bad as you'd expect.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.385
-Cool.
-Not great though. Anyway, I had to.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.845
Henry kept going on about
getting Luke back in one piece,

12:42.971 --> 12:44.597
otherwise he says
he's going to fuck me.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.307
What the hell
does he mean by that?

12:46.432 --> 12:49.102
I don't know, but whatever he means,
let's face it, I don't want it.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.187
So I'm gonna really need you guys
to help me make sure

12:51.312 --> 12:53.106
we get Luke back OK and on time.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.566
-No problem.
-Sure.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.153
Mate, it's never going to fit.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.910
[banging continues]

13:08.079 --> 13:10.039
We're gonna have to put it
in the passenger section.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.545
-How're you doing?
-How the hell did this happen, Graham?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.007
Well, a massive rock fell on him.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.591
[sighs]

13:22.051 --> 13:24.053
Which country
are we flying over now?

13:24.178 --> 13:26.931
-Still Australia.
-What, still?

13:27.056 --> 13:29.434
We've been flying for hours.

13:35.773 --> 13:39.360
-Are you OK?
-Hmm? Oh yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.488
Were you thinking
about your friend?

13:43.072 --> 13:45.324
What? Oh, yeah.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.873
Thanks.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.585
Were you close?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.629
Well, I've known him
since I was a kid, so... you know.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.049
So sad.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.260
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

14:06.429 --> 14:10.975
If there's anything else you need,
just let me know.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.521
Yeah, will do.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.486
I saw this on telly.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.072
Got to get it, pump it all out.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.075
I don't want to get
deep vein thrombosis.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.660
-[groaning]
-Hey.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.287
Psst.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.918
I think I might be in there
with that stewardess.

14:37.627 --> 14:38.711
What?

14:38.836 --> 14:42.465
I've got a feeling she could be up
for a sympathy shag.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.550
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.512
-Anyway, where would you even do it?
-Toilet.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.348
And you really think
that's appropriate?

14:51.349 --> 14:53.893
I'll be honest, mate,
I'm a bit torn on this one.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.937
But then Luke's death
has reminded me

14:56.062 --> 14:59.649
that we need to make the most
of life's opportunities, you know?

14:59.774 --> 15:02.193
So what do you want from me?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.237
-Approval?
-That would be great, actually.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.534
If you really think that
having sex in the toilets

15:09.659 --> 15:11.786
while your friend lies in a box
barely three feet away

15:11.911 --> 15:13.121
is the right thing to do--

15:13.246 --> 15:14.997
Brilliant, thanks, mate, cheers.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.042
You absolutely sure this is alright?

15:18.167 --> 15:21.796
Well, it seemed like you were gonna
keep asking me until I said yes, so...

15:21.921 --> 15:23.423
here you are.

15:23.548 --> 15:26.551
It's just that I've never been
in a cockpit before.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.886
Why do they call it a cockpit?

15:29.011 --> 15:31.097
Is it anything to do
with it having cocks in it?

15:32.682 --> 15:35.810
Sometimes. Yep.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.106
-Do you ever wish it had missiles on it?
-No. Can you just take your fingers?

15:40.231 --> 15:42.150
-Thanks.
-Sorry.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.445
Have you ever been
in an emergency situation

15:45.570 --> 15:47.947
where you had to fly the plane
upside down like Denzel Washington?

15:48.072 --> 15:49.073
No, never.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.492
-Ever met John Travolta?
-No.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.912
Imagine if I was a terrorist
and I just went nuts now.

15:58.249 --> 16:01.461
-Have you always had a moustache?
-No.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.838
-What's that do?
-Yeah, no, don't, don't.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.548
That's the fuel line.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.508
Pretty, isn't it?

16:08.593 --> 16:09.719
Fuck.

16:09.844 --> 16:14.182
Now I'll be honest, I've always had
a thing for stewardesses.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.934
-I'm a flight attendant.
-Yeah, whatever.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.104
It's just that this would be
a really major thing for me

16:20.229 --> 16:21.898
if we could make this happen.

16:22.023 --> 16:25.651
Your dead friend is in that box,
just there.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.445
Yeah, he won't hear anything.

16:27.570 --> 16:31.616
-This is amazing!
-[sighs] Yep.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.369
-Look, birds!
-Ow, fuck! What--

16:35.495 --> 16:38.080
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.584
-What is wrong with you?
-It was an accident.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.211
I got to go and sort this out.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.089
Where are you going?
What about the plane?

16:47.215 --> 16:50.593
It's on auto-pilot,
don't touch anything!

16:53.137 --> 16:56.015
Alright, look,
forget the sex, OK?

16:56.140 --> 16:59.018
-How about just a snog?
-Absolutely not.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.645
-Janet.
-Oh.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.981
Hmm?

17:06.651 --> 17:07.693
<i><font color="white">Luftwaffe!</font></i>

17:07.818 --> 17:09.403
[imitates machine gun]

17:11.321 --> 17:12.656
[beeping]

17:14.659 --> 17:16.493
Erm...

17:17.869 --> 17:19.747
There's a light.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.420
I'll just... tap.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.925
[gasps, sirens blaring]

17:31.050 --> 17:32.093
Hello?

17:32.218 --> 17:33.886
What the fuck?

17:35.471 --> 17:37.765
Oh my God, we have
to go back to our seats.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.225
Captain!

17:39.934 --> 17:41.102
What's going on?

17:41.227 --> 17:42.812
What did you do?

17:42.937 --> 17:44.689
That button went off, so I touched it.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.024
You fucking moron.
What, are you trying to get us all killed?

17:47.149 --> 17:48.818
No.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.611
[screaming]

17:53.114 --> 17:55.241
[screaming]

17:57.910 --> 17:59.245
[pilot] Come on,
come on, come on.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.371
[screaming]

18:00.496 --> 18:01.539
Oh, fuck.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.047
[screaming]

18:14.760 --> 18:15.886
[screams]

18:19.390 --> 18:22.101
[alarm blaring]

18:23.436 --> 18:24.937
[mumbles]

18:26.397 --> 18:27.982
[flatulates]

18:28.107 --> 18:29.859
Could someone help me, please?

18:32.069 --> 18:34.405
-It wasn't my fault.
-Really?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.699
And whose fault was it then,
my Aunt Agatha?

18:36.824 --> 18:40.745
-Who?
-I told you not to touch anything!

18:40.870 --> 18:43.122
[David] What the hell happened?

18:43.247 --> 18:45.583
Your dickwad of a friend here
fucked the plane up

18:45.708 --> 18:48.252
and nearly got us all killed,
that's all.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.171
So what do we do?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.922
Should we try and call for help
on our phones?

18:52.048 --> 18:57.595
Could do, yeah.
Or we could stay out here and die.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.893
-I've got no reception.
-Why haven't we got any reception?

19:04.018 --> 19:06.437
Because we're in the middle
of bumfuck nowhere, that's why.

19:07.188 --> 19:10.858
Personally, I'm going to go
and see if I can find some help.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.443
Yeah, wait for me.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.988
-We should really go with him, David.
-[David] What about Luke?

19:16.113 --> 19:17.198
We'll come back for him.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.911
I'm not leaving him.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.871
You go and send back the help
when you find it.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.791
-I think we should all stay together.
-Fine, then we stay here.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.251
Er... hang on.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.128
Hey?

19:31.253 --> 19:32.922
OK, last go.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.173
So, what are the chances

19:34.298 --> 19:36.842
anything could ever come of what
we were talking about on the plane?

19:37.927 --> 19:41.055
-Fuck... off!
-Fair enough.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.682
[pilot] Come on, Janet, let's go.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.600
OK, fine, we'll stay.

19:46.394 --> 19:49.271
-It bloody stinks around here.
-Yeah.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.316
-That might be me.
-What do you mean?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.236
-I shat myself on that plane.
-We all shat ourselves, Graham.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.029
It was fucking terrifying.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.116
No, I mean, I actually shat myself.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.952
-Jesus, Graham.
-Oh, man.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.704
Go and change, for God's sake.

20:04.829 --> 20:08.499
Yeah, yeah.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.918
-[flatulates]
-Oh.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.089
For fuck's sake.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.387
[Graham] Where are they?
They've been hours.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.890
What do you think
we should do then?

20:25.015 --> 20:28.269
I think we should leave this death pit
and go and find help.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.896
-Alright.
-Alright.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.819
Guys.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.406
We're taking Luke.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.617
What, are you mental?
We can't carry that thing.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.120
That thing is one
of your best friends.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.997
If we leave him here,
he's going to decompose.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.123
We need to get him refrigerated.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.126
We can't carry him,
David, he's too heavy.

20:52.251 --> 20:56.130
You know, I hate to agree with Graham,
but in this case he's right, David.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.592
Lugging his body across
the outback, it's insanity.

21:04.513 --> 21:05.806
OK, fine.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.642
Come on.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.583
[David] See, it's not actually
that heavy.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.586
[Graham] Oh, it fucking is.

21:35.711 --> 21:40.257
[Tom] Oh, we're gonna be fine,
just this way.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.510
Probably a pub around here
somewhere, I reckon.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.428
[Graham] Fucking crocodile
in here, I bet.

21:51.185 --> 21:54.396
[groans] Oh, God,
I can't do this anymore.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.774
I feel like my fingers
are about to snap off.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.943
[David] Shut up, Graham.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.611
[Graham] Seriously,
my back is really bad.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.238
[David and Tom] Shut up, Graham.

22:02.363 --> 22:04.281
[Graham] I reckon
it's probably worse than yours

22:04.406 --> 22:06.784
-because I've got the heavy end.
-[David and Tom] Shut up, Graham.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.953
Right that's it,
we're swapping over.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.746
-You take this end.
-No, no way.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.498
That's your end. David's got the front,
I've got the middle.

22:12.623 --> 22:13.958
We are all used to our positions.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.376
That is the lamest thing
I've ever heard.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.794
You're the lamest thing
I have ever heard.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.754
Yeah? Well your mum's
the lamest thing I've ever heard.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.799
-Your mum's got a beard.
-She's got hormonal problems, Tom.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.176
Can you just stop it?

22:25.177 --> 22:28.013
If we don't get Luke's body
back to London before it goes moldy,

22:29.014 --> 22:31.183
Henry's going to actually
kill us, isn't he?

22:31.308 --> 22:33.644
Quite possibly, yes.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.939
Remember when that kid at school
took a bite of Luke's sandwich?

22:37.064 --> 22:39.316
Henry got hold of the kid,
stuck his head in a urinal

22:39.441 --> 22:40.859
and then pissed on it.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.945
[in unison] Piss-face John Tait.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.530
[chuckles]

22:45.656 --> 22:48.033
[Graham] I'm never walking again.

22:48.158 --> 22:52.121
If we ever make it back to London,
I'm getting a wheelchair.

22:52.246 --> 22:56.667
I'm just gonna tell everyone I'm disabled
and get someone to wheel me around.

22:56.792 --> 23:00.504
[all] Oh, oh, oh,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.965
[David] I think I can see a road.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.259
-Oh, my God.
-[Graham] Where?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.845
[David] Just up there,
do you see it?

23:07.970 --> 23:09.305
[Tom] Not really.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.348
[David] It definitely
looks like a road.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.559
[grunting]

23:17.688 --> 23:19.982
[Graham] You said
there was a road!

23:20.774 --> 23:22.401
[David] I thought there was.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.361
So what do we do now?

23:28.073 --> 23:31.493
-We need to learn from this.
-We're going to die from this.

23:31.619 --> 23:35.706
We need to grow
from this experience. All of us.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.711
That's true, actually.
Especially Graham.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.880
What, what does that mean?

23:43.005 --> 23:46.592
Not just Graham, Tom.
You as well, especially you, in fact.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.302
Why especially me?

23:48.427 --> 23:51.639
Because you're well into your thirties,
you still behave like a horny schoolboy.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.976
You say that
like it's a bad thing, David.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.311
And you crashed the plane.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.064
-It was an accident.
-It was <i><font color="white">not</font></i> an accident.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.940
Yes, it was.
It could've happened to anyone.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.818
-He left me by myself.
-I feel like we're stunted.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.781
All this bickering,
the little snide remarks.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.078
We've got a chance to live our lives.
A chance that Luke didn't have.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.791
If there was any justice at all,

24:20.250 --> 24:22.002
Luke would still be alive.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.837
[Graham] I don't think
I can move anymore.

24:23.962 --> 24:28.175
We're in the middle of nowhere,
totally, totally fucked.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.721
[thunder rumbling]

24:45.651 --> 24:47.152
Look!

24:47.277 --> 24:49.947
-Wait. Stop, wait.
-Wait!

24:52.366 --> 24:53.784
-Stop!
-Hurry up!

24:53.909 --> 24:55.285
Stop!

24:55.411 --> 24:56.912
[shouting indistinctly]

24:57.037 --> 24:59.415
[panting]

25:01.709 --> 25:03.210
[Graham] There's another one.

25:05.087 --> 25:06.547
Stop!

25:06.672 --> 25:08.424
[David] What is that?

25:08.549 --> 25:09.883
<i><font color="white">? Take a little bit ?</font></i>

25:10.008 --> 25:12.094
<i><font color="white">? You're a backseat driver ?</font></i>

25:12.219 --> 25:14.555
<i><font color="white">? Take a little ?</font></i>

25:14.680 --> 25:16.640
-[Graham] Oh, my God.
-Are you boys OK?

25:17.224 --> 25:20.185
Yeah, thank you so much
for stopping.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.855
-What are you guys doing here?
-It's a long story, but...

25:23.939 --> 25:27.192
Basically, we were in a plane
and it crashed.

25:27.317 --> 25:30.028
You had a plane crash?
Bloody hell!

25:30.863 --> 25:33.115
Yeah, he crashed it.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.700
[David] Is there any way

25:34.825 --> 25:37.369
you could take us
to the nearest town?

25:37.494 --> 25:39.204
Sure, come on.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.083
-Amazing.
-Yeah, no worries.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.002
Thank you.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.295
Don't forget your box.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.255
We won't.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.965
-[Angie] What's in that thing?
-Huh?

25:51.759 --> 25:52.760
Sorry?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.554
-What's in the box?
-That box?

25:56.138 --> 25:57.723
[Angie] Yeah, the massive box.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.017
It's, um...

26:03.145 --> 26:04.688
It's meat.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.690
It's meat. [chuckles]

26:06.815 --> 26:11.320
Yeah, we're transporting
a load of... meat.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.908
Yeah, alright.
Why don't you stick it in the back?

26:17.284 --> 26:20.245
[Graham] So, um, where are
you guys actually headed then?

26:20.370 --> 26:22.664
[Angie] We're going to this
little underground festival.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.708
A festival?

26:24.833 --> 26:27.294
Yeah, you guys should come.
It'll be fun.

26:28.170 --> 26:32.049
Lots of drinking, drugs, fucking,
that sort of thing.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.929
-David?
-Absolutely not.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.264
-You don't know what I'm gonna say.
-I know exactly what you're gonna say.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.141
You're gonna say
we should go to the festival,

26:41.266 --> 26:43.894
and there's no way on earth
that's happening.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.230
-Are you feeling sick?
-No, just looking out the window.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.315
-Nice view.
-It is a nice view.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.776
-It's beautiful out here.
-Lovely, very nice.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.236
We need to get Luke home.

26:52.361 --> 26:55.030
We're not sticking around
so you can try and get laid.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.991
Actually, I'm not thinking
of getting laid at all.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.701
I'm thinking of going to the festival

26:59.827 --> 27:02.913
because there'll be food and drink
and a telephone, yeah?

27:03.705 --> 27:05.541
And maybe even a fridge
for the meat.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.209
What does this switch do?

27:07.334 --> 27:09.378
Ah, that one's for the party lights.

27:09.503 --> 27:11.213
I probably shouldn't touch switches.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.590
OK, fine, whatever.

27:13.715 --> 27:17.511
-Graham, do not touch any switches!
-I was just wondering what that one did.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.680
[horn beeping]

27:27.563 --> 27:30.566
Boys! You brought boys!

27:30.691 --> 27:32.276
Excellent!

27:32.401 --> 27:34.820
-Who's that?
-That is Felicity.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.363
She owns the place.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.699
What are you gonna do
with your big box of meat?

27:38.824 --> 27:41.410
-[Felicity] You've brought meat?
-Yeah.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.912
-Come with me.
-[Lisa] See you in there, guys.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.164
[Felicity] This way
to the Felicity festival.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.458
One for you, large for you,
some for you.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.420
[shirtless guy] Condoms,
get your free condoms.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.088
[up-tempo techno music]

28:11.690 --> 28:12.858
Hi.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.611
Hey, how are you?

28:15.736 --> 28:17.613
Hey.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.579
[Felicity] OK, just put it
right down there.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.422
-Alright, I'll see you in a bit.
-Where are you going?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.341
I'm just gonna have a whazz.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.092
-See ya.
-Graham...

28:39.218 --> 28:41.386
I'm gonna go and use the phone.
Keep an eye on that fridge area.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.597
Make sure no-one goes in
and finds Luke.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.225
What, you expect me
to just stand here by myself?

28:46.350 --> 28:48.435
Yeah, that's right.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.568
-Hi.
-Hey!

28:56.693 --> 28:59.196
-You guys look absolutely amazing.
-Thanks.

29:00.322 --> 29:03.408
Wow, when did all this
actually start?

29:03.533 --> 29:04.868
Days ago.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.038
It happens every year
when Felicity's husband goes off.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.374
Everyone gets fucked up
and goes mental.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.500
[screaming]

29:13.293 --> 29:15.796
[phone rings]

29:20.717 --> 29:21.760
Mum!

29:21.885 --> 29:24.388
[phone keeps ringing]

29:24.513 --> 29:26.265
Mummy!

29:29.476 --> 29:32.562
-Can you seriously not hear that?
-Hear what?

29:35.190 --> 29:38.360
-Hello?
<i><font color="white">-Henry? Henry, it's David.</font></i>

29:38.485 --> 29:40.529
David, where the fuck are you?

29:40.654 --> 29:42.489
Listen, everything's fine.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.741
We just had a bit of a problem.
We're gonna be a bit delayed.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.994
What kind of problem?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.246
The plane crashed.

29:50.664 --> 29:53.000
-You what?
<i><font color="white">-But don't worry, Luke's fine.</font></i>

29:53.125 --> 29:54.960
<i><font color="white">I mean, we're going</font></i>
<i><font color="white">to get him back home.</font></i>

29:55.085 --> 29:57.504
Well, he's not fine, is he?

29:57.629 --> 30:01.967
He's dead. I wouldn't exactly
constitute dead as fine. Would you?

30:02.092 --> 30:06.013
Well, no, I mean his body's fine.
We're going to get him back home.

30:06.138 --> 30:09.016
<i><font color="white">Well, how long? The funeral's</font></i>
<i><font color="white">already organized and paid for.</font></i>

30:09.141 --> 30:11.268
It's all going to happen
in a few days.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.478
We'll make it back, I promise.

30:14.104 --> 30:16.064
You remember what I told you, David.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.442
I do, I remember.

30:19.443 --> 30:22.487
It's all going to be fine.
I've got it all under control.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.073
Balls, piss, shit, tits!

30:26.825 --> 30:29.119
-Henry?
-Who the fuck was that?

30:29.244 --> 30:32.581
Er... we just, it's no-one, um...

30:32.706 --> 30:34.791
<i><font color="white">Are you at some kind of party?</font></i>

30:34.916 --> 30:36.376
What? No, it's...

30:36.501 --> 30:39.421
<i><font color="white">It's not really a party.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">It's more of a festival.</font></i>

30:39.546 --> 30:40.547
A festival?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.924
We're in a town near Perth.

30:43.050 --> 30:44.343
Do you mind?

30:46.887 --> 30:49.097
Listen, we're going to get him
back home in one--

30:49.222 --> 30:51.308
Mate, I need to make a call.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.809
It's an emergency.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.561
Won't be a minute.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.021
Sorry about that, Henry.

30:56.146 --> 30:57.439
[dial tone]

30:58.065 --> 31:00.942
Bill, mate?
We need more beer.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.237
Yeah, now.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.075
What do you mean, you can't?
Fucking arsehole!

31:14.456 --> 31:15.874
Sorry, mate.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.670
-[woman] Oh get out of it, you perv!
-Oh, sorry, sorry.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.172
I feel like I'm dying.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.633
You're not dying.
You just need to eat something.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.426
Now, you wait here.

31:26.551 --> 31:30.263
I'm going to make you
a nice, big, juicy...

31:32.140 --> 31:33.683
corpse.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.229
[throws up]

31:42.567 --> 31:44.528
[woman 1] Hey, did you hear
they found a body?

31:44.653 --> 31:46.029
[woman 2] A what?

31:46.154 --> 31:48.782
[woman 1] A body.
Felicity found a dead guy in the kitchen.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.992
-[woman 2] Who is it?
-[woman 1] I don't know, just some guy.

31:51.118 --> 31:53.578
-[woman 2] Let's go take a look.
-[woman 1] Do you think we should?

31:53.703 --> 31:55.330
[woman 2] Yeah.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.626
They've found him.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.422
[Lisa] So, here's an idea.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.757
Want to have a threesome
with me and my mate?

32:05.882 --> 32:07.634
Eh?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.345
Oh, if you're not into it,
I totally get it, it's--

32:10.470 --> 32:12.472
No, of course I'm bloody into it.

32:12.597 --> 32:15.600
Well, hang on, you don't mean
a threesome with a bloke, do you?

32:15.725 --> 32:17.394
No, of course not.

32:17.519 --> 32:20.105
It's my friend Heidi.
Have you seen her?

32:20.230 --> 32:21.940
She's gorgeous.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.651
She's pretty filthy too,
so if you don't want to, I get it.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.112
No, it's OK,
I don't discriminate.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.197
OK, great.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.782
So I'll go get her then, shall I?

32:30.907 --> 32:32.242
Yeah.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.870
Er... OK.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.914
Oh, yeah... Oh!

32:39.875 --> 32:41.168
[gasping]

32:41.751 --> 32:43.712
I know, why don't we paint him?

32:43.837 --> 32:46.047
That's a fucking brilliant idea.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.632
[cheering]

32:50.886 --> 32:54.389
Tom, thank God. We need you.
They've got Luke.

32:54.890 --> 32:55.891
What?

32:56.016 --> 32:57.809
They've found Luke.
We've gotta go and sort it out.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.479
Alright, you guys go and do that.
I'll catch you up in a bit.

33:00.604 --> 33:03.023
-What d'you mean? You're coming too.
-I can't.

33:03.607 --> 33:08.612
-What do you mean, you can't?
-That girl, Lisa, she is... threesome.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.864
-What?
-We're gonna have a threesome.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.741
Me, her and her mate.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.495
-We don't have time to discuss this.
-You two need to fuck off.

33:16.620 --> 33:21.041
-Just come on.
-No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.671
-Hey, what's going on?
-Er... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:26.796 --> 33:29.049
-Oh.
-Damn!

33:29.174 --> 33:31.635
[humming]

33:38.517 --> 33:41.269
[rhythmic music]

33:52.405 --> 33:54.699
[crowd cheering]

34:00.330 --> 34:02.791
[up-tempo music]

34:08.129 --> 34:10.757
Stop! Stop! Stop!

34:12.467 --> 34:14.010
Stop.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.137
That's our friend.

34:16.263 --> 34:19.933
Well what the fuck are you bringing
your dead friend to a festival for?

34:20.433 --> 34:22.143
We're trying to get his body home.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.812
A snake bit my cock!

34:23.937 --> 34:26.106
A snake bit my cock!
A snake bit my cock!

34:26.231 --> 34:27.899
[crowd chattering]

34:35.447 --> 34:36.908
Graham, come on.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.839
Let's go. Go! Go!

34:50.964 --> 34:53.049
[grunting]

35:07.188 --> 35:10.734
You need to go to Perth
and bring Luke back.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.486
You can't trust those boys.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.031
I'm not going to Perth.
It's on the other side of the planet.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.532
What?

35:17.657 --> 35:20.368
I'm not going to Perth,
it's miles away.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.913
-You need to go to Perth.
-I'm not going to Perth.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.499
You need to get
on the next flight out there.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.043
I'm not going!

35:28.501 --> 35:30.170
Good!

35:30.295 --> 35:32.213
You go over and meet them

35:32.339 --> 35:36.509
and make sure you bring Luke back
in time for the funeral.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.178
It's all paid for.

35:38.303 --> 35:43.224
Alright, I'll fucking go,
to fucking Perth, for fuck's sake!

35:45.602 --> 35:48.188
[birds squawking]

35:54.486 --> 35:56.321
I still can't believe it.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.074
A bloody threesome.
A threesome!

35:59.199 --> 36:02.202
It's alright for you two,
you don't understand this stuff.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.788
But I depend on these
deviant sexual experiences

36:04.913 --> 36:07.332
to give my life some sense
of meaning.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.251
[Graham] Boys,

36:10.377 --> 36:12.962
does anyone else think
this box looks a bit like a penis?

36:13.755 --> 36:15.465
[Tom] It does a bit.

36:15.590 --> 36:16.883
A big gold cock.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.635
[Graham] It's got a helmet.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.272
[clanking]

36:37.570 --> 36:39.572
Hi, everyone.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.784
Sorry to disturb you all,

36:42.909 --> 36:46.830
but we really need a lift
as far to Perth as possible.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.958
Is there anyone that might
be able to help us out?

37:00.218 --> 37:02.470
Yeah, I'll take youse.

37:03.847 --> 37:07.392
-Thank you so much.
-No worries, ten minutes, OK?

37:08.435 --> 37:10.270
Perfect.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.480
Hey.

37:26.828 --> 37:31.249
-What's in the box?
-Oh, erm... it's our mate.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.001
-Eh?
-Yeah.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.586
So that's his coffin.

37:34.711 --> 37:37.297
-Yeah.
-Eh? Dead, is he?

37:38.047 --> 37:39.340
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.428
You don't want to be wheeling him
around like that. Not in this heat.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.138
-No, I know.
-You wanna get him buried.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.681
-Yeah, I know that.
-He'll start going bad.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.224
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

37:48.349 --> 37:51.019
-Thanks for the advice.
-Yeah, no. No worries.

37:51.144 --> 37:54.814
Anyway, you just stick your mate in
the back of my truck and we'll head off.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.277
Thank you so much again.
This is such an incredible help.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.196
Yeah, no worries.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.948
I'll just take a piss
and then we'll head off.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.284
Uh, which truck is it?

38:07.327 --> 38:09.871
It's the white one out the back
to the left, handsome.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.002
-Right.
-Right.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.680
[all] Two, three.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.557
[grunting]

38:29.682 --> 38:31.684
Slow, slow, slow!

38:33.645 --> 38:35.271
[grunts]

38:39.150 --> 38:41.110
[Graham] Get the side up.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.453
OK, we're ready.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.331
-Righto, let's go.
-Great.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.627
-Er...
-Ah?

38:57.752 --> 39:00.588
-Sorry, where are you going?
-[Eric] To my truck.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.215
Your truck's over there, mate.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.133
No, it isn't.

39:06.845 --> 39:10.557
-You said the white one on the left.
-Did I say left?

39:11.391 --> 39:13.059
I meant right. Sorry.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.936
I'm always getting them two
muddled up.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.145
-What?
-What?

39:16.271 --> 39:17.605
-Huh?
-Mm?

39:17.730 --> 39:18.940
It's there.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.818
-Er... er, it's going.
-What?

39:21.943 --> 39:24.320
-The truck. It's going.
-Wait, wait.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.281
-No, stop.
-Wait. Stop.

39:26.406 --> 39:28.950
-Oh, that's funny.
-Wait!

39:29.617 --> 39:31.744
-Wait, wait.
-Stop, stop.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.872
-Stop.
-Stop.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.545
[Tom] What the fuck?

39:41.754 --> 39:43.631
Eric...

39:44.424 --> 39:46.801
[Graham] Hey, hey.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.345
[grunting]

39:50.930 --> 39:53.600
Well, what did you do?
Put your penis in the wrong truck?

39:53.725 --> 39:55.226
Yes, we need to catch up with it,
let's go.

39:55.351 --> 39:56.811
Righto.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.857
-Quick.
-Quickly.

40:02.317 --> 40:05.111
-[Graham] Can you hurry up, please?
-Yeah, righto.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.159
[groans] Bad hip.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.039
Let's go.

40:16.164 --> 40:19.042
-Righto, seat belts on.
-Come on, please.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.966
[panting] Quickly! Quickly!

40:38.102 --> 40:39.437
[Eric] Almost made it.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.481
[Graham] Sorry,
but we've really got to hurry up.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.441
[Eric] Yeah, righto.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.526
-Am I clear at the back?
-Yes!

40:45.652 --> 40:47.612
Yes, you're fine.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.448
-[David] Come on, please.
-[Tom] Go.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.909
-[Graham] Hey, let's go.
-[Eric] And we're off.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.871
[humming]

41:07.507 --> 41:10.885
Can you please just put more pressure
on the accelerator pedal?

41:11.010 --> 41:13.221
I don't want to get a speeding ticket.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.974
I'll pay the ticket, I'll pay double!

41:16.099 --> 41:18.476
I don't like being indebted to people.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.188
Just put your foot down
on the fucking accelerator!

41:22.313 --> 41:25.191
Jesus, keep your hair on, will ya?

41:26.526 --> 41:27.735
You really should've checked

41:27.860 --> 41:30.905
before you put your penis
in the wrong truck, you know?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.700
[humming]

41:36.327 --> 41:38.413
This is no good.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.039
He's gone.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.792
Just stop the truck, please.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.919
Just stop the truck!

41:47.672 --> 41:49.716
Fucking, God, fuck!

41:50.883 --> 41:52.635
[grunts]

41:56.931 --> 41:58.474
Fuck!

42:00.226 --> 42:02.103
Fuck!

42:02.228 --> 42:04.188
[cows mooing]

42:22.206 --> 42:24.042
Right.

42:24.167 --> 42:25.668
What do we do?

42:25.793 --> 42:27.837
What are our options?

42:27.962 --> 42:30.798
Yeah, it's not gonna be easy
tracing a white truck.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.342
Every fucker seems to have one.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.344
Did either of you
see the number plate?

42:35.470 --> 42:37.055
Nah.

42:37.180 --> 42:39.766
-I saw it.
-You did?

42:39.891 --> 42:41.517
That's amazing, what was it?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.519
-I can't remember.
-What do you mean?

42:43.644 --> 42:45.104
Well, I wasn't really
paying attention.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.815
Why weren't you paying attention?
You should always be paying attention.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.651
Well, I'm sorry. I mean,
I didn't know this was gonna happen!

42:50.777 --> 42:52.945
I'm never going to remember
if you two keep shouting at me.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.280
No, he's right, he's right. OK.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.491
Look, we all need
to just calm down, OK?

42:57.283 --> 43:00.036
Now just think back, think.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.998
It was a name,
it was a weird name.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.042
Great.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.002
And what was it?

43:09.045 --> 43:10.546
It was, erm...

43:11.047 --> 43:12.924
It was...

43:13.549 --> 43:14.592
Just think.

43:15.384 --> 43:17.595
Relax and think.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.598
It's inside you, Graham.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.184
It's, er...

43:23.309 --> 43:25.061
[David] You can do it, Graham.

43:26.437 --> 43:27.438
It's gone.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.649
What do you mean it's gone?
Just think, just fucking think!

43:29.774 --> 43:32.276
Why can't you ever
get anything right?

43:32.401 --> 43:33.986
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

43:34.112 --> 43:35.947
Well let's just think, shall we?

43:36.072 --> 43:37.073
You crashed the plane.

43:37.198 --> 43:39.200
You didn't stay with Luke
when you were supposed to.

43:39.325 --> 43:42.495
You basically fuck up everything
you've ever been involved in!

43:42.620 --> 43:44.789
-He's out of order.
-David, just calm down a bit.

43:44.914 --> 43:46.582
I can't calm down!

43:46.707 --> 43:49.627
I'm responsible for this!
Don't you get it?

43:50.837 --> 43:54.215
Luke wouldn't even have been
in Australia if it wasn't for me.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.925
And now he's dead.

43:57.009 --> 43:58.469
And the very least I can do

43:58.594 --> 44:00.471
is deliver him to his aunt
in one piece.

44:02.265 --> 44:05.017
If I can't do that one
little thing for him,

44:06.686 --> 44:09.021
how am I ever gonna
live with myself?

44:10.982 --> 44:13.025
Mate.

44:15.361 --> 44:16.821
I'm sorry, brother.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.201
Mmh.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.954
Mungus.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.248
-What?
-Mungus.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.375
The number plate,
it said Mungus.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.835
-Mungus?
-Mungus.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.671
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

44:36.591 --> 44:39.260
Eric, do you know where
the nearest police station is?

44:39.385 --> 44:42.013
Yeah, no, yeah.

44:58.779 --> 45:00.531
-What, is this it?
-Yeah.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.201
OK, cool.

45:04.327 --> 45:05.995
Well, thanks for the lift.

45:06.787 --> 45:11.292
And I'm sorry that I, you know,
shouted and stuff.

45:11.417 --> 45:13.002
Did you shout?

45:14.545 --> 45:16.547
A bit, yeah.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.382
Ah.

45:19.550 --> 45:22.511
-Anyway, thanks.
-[Eric] Yeah.

45:23.846 --> 45:26.766
Yeah, I'll be seeing youse.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.894
-Yeah, cheers.
-Cheers.

45:30.436 --> 45:31.437
Cheers.

45:31.562 --> 45:35.524
Yeah, youse take care
of yourselves now, eh.

45:35.650 --> 45:37.693
We will.

45:39.946 --> 45:41.447
Cheers.

45:41.572 --> 45:45.242
Yeah, I'll be heading off now
anyway, so...

45:45.368 --> 45:47.536
Man.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.538
OK.

45:49.664 --> 45:51.874
-Bye.
-Bye.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.796
Did you say something?

45:59.006 --> 46:01.550
-No.
-No?

46:03.844 --> 46:06.138
-You can go now.
-Okie-dokie.

46:07.598 --> 46:08.891
[starts engine]

46:09.016 --> 46:10.726
[Eric] Cheers.

46:10.851 --> 46:12.353
[humming]

46:15.439 --> 46:19.151
"If unattended,
please ring bell."

46:19.276 --> 46:21.028
Well go on, press it.

46:21.153 --> 46:22.655
Press it.

46:23.406 --> 46:25.116
There.

46:26.826 --> 46:28.244
[doorbell rings]

46:28.369 --> 46:29.370
Good one.

46:31.622 --> 46:33.874
I'll be fucked.

46:35.042 --> 46:37.420
[sighs]

46:37.545 --> 46:40.423
-Yes?
-Hi there, Officer.

46:40.548 --> 46:41.924
This is a bit of an odd one.

46:42.049 --> 46:44.760
We're trying to find a guy
we think might live in the area.

46:44.885 --> 46:47.388
We've got his number plate. We were
hoping you could give us his address.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.307
Yeah, definitely.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.393
-Oh. Brilliant
-Great.

46:52.518 --> 46:55.479
No, I'm always giving out people's
addresses to random strangers.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.608
-Really?
-Yeah, all day long.

47:01.485 --> 47:02.820
Are you being sarcastic?

47:02.945 --> 47:05.322
No, I'm not being sarcastic.
Why would I be sarcastic?

47:06.699 --> 47:07.992
Well, it's really important.

47:08.743 --> 47:10.995
Is it? Why?

47:11.120 --> 47:13.456
-Because he's got something of ours.
-What's he got?

47:14.331 --> 47:17.209
-It's a box.
-A box? What's it look like?

47:17.710 --> 47:22.048
-A penis, a gold penis.
-A penis?

47:22.631 --> 47:24.008
It's gold, a gold penis.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.052
Right.

47:27.303 --> 47:30.723
Anything in this
penis-shaped box,

47:30.848 --> 47:34.060
or is it just an empty
penis-shaped box?

47:34.185 --> 47:36.145
Oh, yeah,
there's something in it.

47:36.270 --> 47:37.480
What?

47:38.272 --> 47:40.566
It's our friend.

47:40.691 --> 47:43.277
Your friend is
in a penis-shaped box?

47:43.402 --> 47:45.029
Gold penis.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.490
What is this, a joke?

47:47.615 --> 47:50.993
This isn't a joke.
This is absolutely serious.

47:51.118 --> 47:52.369
Our friend died.

47:52.495 --> 47:54.789
We were taking him back home
and our plane crash-landed

47:54.914 --> 47:56.916
and now someone's taken him off
in a penis-shaped box.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.459
-[Tom] Yep.
-Gone.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.800
You know wasting police time
is a criminal offence, don't ya?

48:11.430 --> 48:13.057
Dickheads.

48:13.182 --> 48:14.934
Huh?

48:16.268 --> 48:18.813
[door slams shut]

48:18.938 --> 48:22.441
-Well, is she coming back or what?
-It's unclear, isn't it?

48:32.785 --> 48:34.745
She's just sitting there
with her feet up.

48:34.870 --> 48:37.581
Oh, for fuck's sake!
What's going on in this place?

48:37.706 --> 48:41.252
-How are we gonna find Mungus now?
-I know Mungus.

48:42.086 --> 48:43.462
You do?

48:43.587 --> 48:46.132
Know where he lives, too.
I can take you there if you like.

48:46.257 --> 48:48.717
That'd be fucking fantastic, thank you!

48:48.843 --> 48:51.178
No problem, get in the Kombi.

48:55.307 --> 48:58.519
David, you lump of shit.

48:59.645 --> 49:01.522
It's Henry.

49:01.647 --> 49:04.650
I'm in Abu Dhabi,
on the way to Perth

49:04.775 --> 49:07.903
to make sure you don't
screw up getting Luke back.

49:08.028 --> 49:10.531
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

49:10.656 --> 49:12.783
Here's what I want you to do.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.870
<i><font color="white">? Ooh, la, la, la, la, la ?</font></i>

49:15.995 --> 49:17.329
<i><font color="white">? Yeah ?</font></i>

49:17.454 --> 49:19.874
<i><font color="white">? Ooh, la, la, la, la, la ?</font></i>

49:21.792 --> 49:23.294
Thanks for driving us here.

49:23.419 --> 49:25.588
-Really grateful.
-No worries.

49:25.713 --> 49:27.548
So, what were you doing
at the police station earlier on?

49:27.673 --> 49:29.300
I got done for assault.

49:29.425 --> 49:31.051
Oh.

49:32.386 --> 49:34.221
You're cute.

49:34.346 --> 49:35.806
Am I? Thanks.

49:35.931 --> 49:38.517
I don't usually go for English blokes
'cause they're all gay,

49:38.642 --> 49:41.270
but I'd consider doing you.

49:41.395 --> 49:42.897
[laughs]

49:43.022 --> 49:44.481
-Really?
-Yeah.

49:44.607 --> 49:45.649
Thanks.

49:46.984 --> 49:49.278
You like Australian women?

49:49.403 --> 49:51.530
Oh, yeah, sure.
Do you know any?

49:56.827 --> 49:58.746
-What the fuck does that mean?
-[Graham] I'm sorry.

49:58.871 --> 50:00.873
-It was meant to be a joke.
-Why have we stopped?

50:00.998 --> 50:02.666
Because you're all fucking off,
that's why.

50:02.791 --> 50:05.002
-What have you done now?
-Well, I didn't mean anything by it.

50:05.127 --> 50:07.671
-What did you say?
-Oh go on, tell him.

50:07.796 --> 50:10.382
Well, Maureen asked
if I liked Australian women,

50:10.507 --> 50:12.927
and I said,
"Why, do you know any?"

50:13.052 --> 50:16.680
-Oh, you wanker!
-Well, Maureen, come back.

50:18.849 --> 50:21.769
-Jesus, Graham.
-What? I didn't think it was that bad.

50:26.482 --> 50:28.150
Utter penis.

50:28.275 --> 50:29.276
Ow!

50:35.699 --> 50:39.787
Maureen, I'd just like to apologize
on behalf of my friend. He's an idiot.

50:39.912 --> 50:42.122
-Yes, he is, a total idiot.
-I know.

50:42.248 --> 50:45.042
A total fucking idiot!

50:47.127 --> 50:50.631
Anyway, I know you're upset,

50:50.756 --> 50:53.884
but do you think it would be OK for you
to please take us to Mungus's place?

50:54.009 --> 50:57.221
Well, I don't know now. I feel like
I'm having the piss taken out of me.

50:57.346 --> 50:58.639
No-one's taking the piss out of you.

50:58.764 --> 51:03.102
You think because I'm not 25 years old,
I'm not a sexual being, don't you?

51:04.478 --> 51:08.065
-No, I don't think that at all.
-Well, he fucking does!

51:15.072 --> 51:17.283
-Hi, guys.
-What's going on?

51:17.408 --> 51:19.535
So, here's the deal.

51:19.660 --> 51:22.955
Maureen's agreed to take us
to Mungus's, but on one condition.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.623
What's the condition?

51:24.748 --> 51:26.500
She, um...

51:27.459 --> 51:29.253
-She...
-Well, come on David, spit it out.

51:29.378 --> 51:31.505
-She wants to have sex.
-Eurgh!

51:31.630 --> 51:33.215
-She wants to have sex.
-Who with?

51:33.340 --> 51:34.967
-With Graham.
-What?

51:35.092 --> 51:37.511
-Is she fucking joking?
-She's definitely not joking.

51:37.636 --> 51:40.139
She says you insulted her, so now
she feels the need to prove to you

51:40.264 --> 51:42.308
that she's the best lover
in the whole of Western Australia.

51:42.433 --> 51:43.767
-Fair enough.
-I believe her.

51:43.892 --> 51:46.395
It's not enough,
she wants to prove it.

51:48.522 --> 51:51.275
But she's too old. She looks
like my gran, for fuck's sake.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.818
-Which gran?
-Granny Charlotte.

51:52.943 --> 51:55.154
-Oh yeah, she does a bit.
-OK, but she's not actually your gran.

51:55.279 --> 51:58.115
-Does look a lot like her though.
-Tom, will you shut up?

51:58.240 --> 52:00.409
As I was saying,
she's not actually your gran.

52:00.534 --> 52:01.994
And the fact is, if you don't do it,

52:02.119 --> 52:04.121
we're gonna end up stranded
in the middle of fucksville,

52:04.246 --> 52:06.373
with a very good chance
we'll lose Luke forever.

52:06.498 --> 52:08.917
Well, is there any wiggle room
for negotiation?

52:09.043 --> 52:11.295
-Maybe she'll accept a fingering?
-Oh, Tom.

52:11.420 --> 52:13.047
She was very clear.

52:13.172 --> 52:17.259
-It's got to be full-blown intercourse.
-Oh, for fuck's sake! You do it, David.

52:17.384 --> 52:20.054
-I can't do it, I'm married.
-Who gives a shit if you're married?

52:20.179 --> 52:21.472
I don't know if you've
heard of this concept,

52:21.597 --> 52:23.724
but married people aren't
supposed to go shagging around.

52:23.849 --> 52:25.100
It's not shagging around, is it?

52:25.225 --> 52:27.311
It's shagging one person
for a very specific reason

52:27.436 --> 52:28.854
and these are very
mitigating circumstances.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.272
I'm not sure Mia's
going to see it like that.

52:30.397 --> 52:32.107
Anyway, you're single,
you won't be cheating on anyone.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.276
-What, Tom's single.
-Yeah, but she doesn't want me.

52:34.401 --> 52:36.278
She wants you.
She asked for you very specifically.

52:36.403 --> 52:39.281
Maybe if you offered yourself to her.
I mean, come on, this is your area.

52:39.406 --> 52:41.867
-What, shagging old women?
-Yeah, you're always experimenting.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.036
No, I've never done anything like this.
This is fucking nuts.

52:44.161 --> 52:47.122
Hey, hurry up,
or I'm taking off!

52:47.831 --> 52:49.708
Won't be a minute.

52:49.833 --> 52:51.335
Aw, she's horrible.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.670
Alright, thumbs up,
thumbs down.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.506
-No Graham.
-No Graham.

52:55.631 --> 52:58.092
But look, I can't physically do it.
Don't you understand that?

52:58.217 --> 52:59.385
What do you mean?

52:59.510 --> 53:01.887
Look there's something I've been
meaning to tell you for some time,

53:02.012 --> 53:06.350
and I'm sorry it's taken me this long
to tell you, but... I'm a gay.

53:07.226 --> 53:09.061
You're gay?

53:09.186 --> 53:12.773
And it would be a total betrayal
of myself to my sexuality.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.776
I just can't do it to my gay brothers
and sisters. They'd be livid.

53:15.901 --> 53:17.319
Nice try, Graham.

53:17.444 --> 53:20.030
Look, I'm not bullshitting you.
I really am a gay!

53:20.155 --> 53:23.367
I've known you for 30 years. You're not
gay, you're just trying to get out of it.

53:23.492 --> 53:25.285
Alright, alright, I'm not gay,

53:25.411 --> 53:27.704
but please, please David,
please don't make me do it.

53:27.830 --> 53:30.040
Graham, look,

53:30.165 --> 53:31.959
our friend's dead.

53:32.084 --> 53:33.877
His body is out there somewhere,

53:34.002 --> 53:36.672
and our only chance of getting him
back home to his aunt and mad cousin

53:36.797 --> 53:38.882
is if you go and shag
that old lady over there.

53:39.007 --> 53:41.969
-Now, come on, man.
-Yeah, come on, man.

53:42.094 --> 53:43.554
Do it for Luke.

53:43.679 --> 53:45.806
[gagging]

53:45.931 --> 53:47.891
[grunting]

53:50.144 --> 53:52.646
[Maureen] Whoo,
do I turn you on, Grah?

53:52.771 --> 53:54.773
-Yeah.
-Do you want me to help you?

53:54.898 --> 53:57.234
No, it's alright, Maureen.
I know what I'm doing, it's fine.

53:57.359 --> 54:01.196
-Now give us a snog, I'm not a hooker.
-OK, I just...

54:01.321 --> 54:03.365
[groaning]

54:06.285 --> 54:08.328
Oh, Maureen, ah.

54:08.454 --> 54:10.539
-Oh. [giggling]
-Ah.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.875
See, I knew you could do it.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.043
Alright.

54:15.169 --> 54:17.337
Just... oh, oh.

54:17.463 --> 54:18.464
[groaning]

54:18.589 --> 54:21.800
-Shall we move a bit further away?
-Huh?

54:21.925 --> 54:23.886
[grunting]

54:26.513 --> 54:28.182
-Let's, yeah.
-[David] Fuck, that's different.

54:28.307 --> 54:30.767
-Tom.
-Yeah.

54:30.893 --> 54:32.519
[groaning]

54:36.106 --> 54:37.524
[laughing]

54:38.150 --> 54:41.445
[Graham] I'm a naughty boy,
Maureen. I'm an animal.

54:41.570 --> 54:45.741
Uh! Oh, God. I'm going again.
I'm going again.

54:45.866 --> 54:47.993
Oh! Ooh, it's nice.

54:48.118 --> 54:50.746
Ooh, woman nipples.

54:50.871 --> 54:53.332
[groaning]

54:53.457 --> 54:55.042
[Maureen giggling]

54:55.167 --> 54:56.793
[Graham] Careful, don't snap it.

55:05.844 --> 55:07.846
-Jesus, are you OK?
-Yeah.

55:07.971 --> 55:10.098
You've been in there fucking ages.

55:13.644 --> 55:16.355
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

55:16.480 --> 55:18.982
Fucking hell,
you actually enjoyed it, didn't you?

55:19.107 --> 55:20.943
Why, what was so good about it?

55:21.068 --> 55:23.570
-What did she do?
-[laughs]

55:23.695 --> 55:27.574
-Oh, a gentleman never tells.
-What?

55:29.159 --> 55:30.494
[Graham] That woman is very creative.

55:30.619 --> 55:32.913
I am as empty
as an empty shower pump.

55:33.038 --> 55:34.039
What?

55:34.164 --> 55:36.792
<i><font color="white">? Oh, la, la, la, la, la ?</font></i>

55:38.502 --> 55:41.755
<i><font color="white">? Oh, la, la, la, la, la ?</font></i>
-Oh, I'm alright, thanks.

55:47.844 --> 55:49.304
Well, here we are.

55:49.429 --> 55:52.099
Mungus lives right in there,
so out you get.

55:52.224 --> 55:53.267
Ah, brilliant.

55:53.392 --> 55:55.852
Thanks Maureen, you're a star.

55:59.189 --> 56:03.277
Hey, er, listen, maybe we could grab
a drink or something while I'm in town.

56:03.402 --> 56:05.571
I don't think so, mate.

56:05.696 --> 56:08.282
Right...
Right, fair enough.

56:09.616 --> 56:13.245
So um, Maureen, are you
on Facebook or anything?

56:13.370 --> 56:14.371
Why?

56:14.496 --> 56:17.791
Well I thought maybe we could,
you know, keep in touch.

56:17.916 --> 56:20.919
Look, son, this was
a one-off deal, hmm?

56:21.753 --> 56:23.964
Right, understood.

56:25.007 --> 56:27.467
You could follow me
on Twitter if you like.

56:28.802 --> 56:29.803
Yeah?

56:29.928 --> 56:32.598
MaureenB1939.

56:32.723 --> 56:35.475
No direct messaging though.

56:36.518 --> 56:38.645
MaureenB1939.

56:38.770 --> 56:40.188
[Maureen] Mm.

56:46.987 --> 56:48.405
[birds chirping]

56:50.282 --> 56:52.284
Fuck off.

56:52.409 --> 56:54.328
Probably a bit louder.

56:54.453 --> 56:55.954
[fly buzzing]

57:01.251 --> 57:02.502
Oh, for fuck's sake.

57:02.628 --> 57:05.130
-[Graham] Shh!
-[Mungus] Hello?

57:07.382 --> 57:09.217
-Hi there.
-Is that Mungus?

57:09.343 --> 57:10.844
No.

57:10.969 --> 57:12.971
Yes, who's there?

57:14.640 --> 57:17.017
We're sorry to disturb you.

57:17.142 --> 57:18.810
We think you might have something
that belongs to us.

57:21.813 --> 57:23.231
-It's our friend.
-Shut up!

57:23.357 --> 57:25.984
-Can you just let me deal with this?
-Alright.

57:26.652 --> 57:28.528
[multiple locks unlocking]

57:34.034 --> 57:35.243
G'day.

57:35.911 --> 57:37.537
You're Mungus, yeah?

57:37.663 --> 57:40.165
Yeah, George Mungus.
How can I help you?

57:40.290 --> 57:43.335
We put something in your truck
by mistake

57:43.460 --> 57:44.962
when you were
at the roadhouse earlier.

57:45.671 --> 57:47.756
In my truck?
What did you put in my truck?

57:47.881 --> 57:50.801
-Ah well, It's a box.
-Looks like a penis.

57:50.926 --> 57:53.470
Do you mind if we
just take a quick look?

57:53.595 --> 57:55.639
I know it sounds a bit weird.

57:55.764 --> 57:58.517
Do you mind if we take a look,
see if it's still there?

58:01.478 --> 58:04.022
Yeah, sure.
The truck's just round the back.

58:08.276 --> 58:10.654
-He's there.
-Wow!

58:10.779 --> 58:11.989
[laughs]

58:12.114 --> 58:14.032
I did not even know
that was there.

58:14.157 --> 58:16.034
We put it in there by accident,
I'm so sorry.

58:16.159 --> 58:18.286
Ah, no worries.

58:18.412 --> 58:20.789
-So how did you blokes find me?
-Maureen.

58:21.748 --> 58:25.502
-She's a special lady, that Maureen.
-Yeah, she is.

58:28.213 --> 58:31.091
So, I don't suppose
we could make a call,

58:31.216 --> 58:32.592
sort out some transport?

58:32.718 --> 58:34.386
Yeah, of course you can.

58:35.053 --> 58:37.264
-Come on inside.
-Amazing, thanks.

58:37.389 --> 58:39.224
No worries.

58:41.685 --> 58:43.937
I got to be honest, I don't think
I'll be telling the boys down the pub

58:44.062 --> 58:46.982
that I've been carting around
a massive steel penis.

58:48.233 --> 58:49.943
So do you guys want a cup of tea
or anything?

58:50.068 --> 58:51.236
Ah, fuck yeah,
that would be great.

58:51.361 --> 58:53.780
Er... can I just ask you guys
a small favor though?

58:53.905 --> 58:55.490
Sure, what is it?

58:55.615 --> 58:58.201
Can I introduce you to my mother?
I know she'd love to meet you.

59:00.620 --> 59:04.207
-Yeah, sure, why not?
-Great. I'll, er... I'll go get her then.

59:04.332 --> 59:06.460
The living room's
just around the corner there.

59:09.171 --> 59:11.006
-Hands off her, Graham.
-Shut up.

59:11.131 --> 59:12.799
[laughing]

59:15.010 --> 59:17.179
Right, where's this old biddy then?

59:17.763 --> 59:19.181
Don't know.

59:19.306 --> 59:21.308
Still, Mungus seems
a decent bloke at least.

59:21.433 --> 59:22.851
I know.

59:22.976 --> 59:26.354
Nice to finally meet someone
in this place who isn't mental.

59:27.272 --> 59:29.232
Hello.

59:29.357 --> 59:31.526
Oh, you are
fucking kidding me.

59:32.944 --> 59:34.738
That's Mungus, isn't it?

59:34.863 --> 59:36.198
I'm afraid so.

59:36.990 --> 59:40.494
It is such a pleasure
to meet you boys.

59:40.619 --> 59:43.205
George has told me
all about you.

59:43.330 --> 59:45.457
Oh, I'm sorry,
where are my manners?

59:45.582 --> 59:46.750
I'm Mother.

59:46.875 --> 59:49.669
Now I want to make yourselves
as comfortable as--

59:49.795 --> 59:52.506
-We, er... really need to be going.
-Too fucking right.

59:53.256 --> 59:54.508
Oh, there it is.

59:56.176 --> 59:58.970
-I've been looking for that.
-Oh, I don't like this.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.306
-For the cake.
-OK, look...

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.059
-We just want to take our friend and go.
-Your friend?

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:07.521
Oh, you mean the young lady
that was in the box?

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:09.856
-What do you mean, "lady"?
-What do you mean, "was"?

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.775
Well, I've moved her
into the bedroom.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.985
[creaking]

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:21.076
Isn't she lovely?

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:27.958
Hello, sweetheart.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:32.045
So, tea and cake
for everyone, yes?

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.589
Good.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:37.342
Now, you guys go and get dressed,

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.719
and I'll see you out there
in a minute.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.431
-[Tom] Get dressed?
-Well, yes.

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.059
You have to get dressed
for the tea party.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:50.355
Everything you need is in there.

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:53.066
-In there?
-Yeah.

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:54.818
In you go.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:04.786
[lock clicks]

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:08.331
-[Graham] What the fuck is going on?
-That bloke is fucking nuts.

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:11.877
Yeah, but he's not just nuts though.
He's a fucking psychopath.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.754
-He's gonna kill us and wear our skin.
-No, he's not, Graham.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.256
How do you fucking know?

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:19.217
Because we're gonna keep calm,
and do what he asks,

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:21.761
-and we're gonna find a way out.
-Do what he asks?

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:24.014
What, dress up as trannies?

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:27.184
No fucking way.
I'm not dressing up like a tranny.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:28.935
-That's page one, David.
-Stop saying tranny.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.812
-Tranny, tranny.
-He's not a tranny.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.606
-Tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny.
-He's not a tranny.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:35.233
-Am I offending you, David?
-Yes, you are.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.569
I don't give a shit that he wears a dress
and thinks he's his mother.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.613
I give a shit that he's in there
with a fifteen-inch machete

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.239
and there's every indication
that he's mad enough to use it.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.700
You two do what you want to do.
I'm making a run for it.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:46.703
But she's out there.
She might kill us if we run.

01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:49.456
Well, I'll take my chances.
It's every man for himself.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:50.874
Tom, just be rational about this.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:54.502
If that means having a dress-ups
tea party with Norman fucking Bates,

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.296
then I'd rather not be rational, thanks.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:59.549
I'm not gonna die now, especially when
I didn't even get my fucking threesome!

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:01.801
We're going to die.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.306
Oh, I think he shat himself again.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:09.017
Oh for fuck's sake, have you?

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.187
You got a real problem,
you know that?

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.650
OK, fine.

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.444
So, what's your master plan then?

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.738
[upbeat music]

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.742
Well, this is great, isn't it?

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:26.993
Yeah.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:30.872
What's wrong with your friend?
He seems a bit uncomfortable.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.167
-He shat himself.
-Oh, I see. Mmh.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:39.422
Mmh. Well... anyone for cake?

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.634
[screaming]

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.844
No?

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.347
Well, in that case

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:50.892
I would like
to make a quick toast

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.520
to thank you all for coming.

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:55.480
I get a bit lonely here sometimes,

01:02:55.605 --> 01:03:01.444
which is why I'm so happy to have met
you wonderful English ladies,

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:04.531
and I would love it
if we could all stay together

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:07.492
for a very long time indeed.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.619
Basically, forever really.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:11.913
Cheers, everyone.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:13.331
Everyone.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.041
[clanking]

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:16.251
Cheers.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.044
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:21.214
Now, who would like Lamingtons?

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.134
Yes?

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:26.094
Right. Hmm.

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:32.350
Did you hear him say forever?
That means dead.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.102
Right, can I make a strong suggestion

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:37.814
that we leave now before
he chops us up into little pieces?

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:40.984
-OK, let's go.
-Come on.

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.194
[groans]

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.738
[Tom] Are you fucking joking?
Leave him!

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.573
We're not leaving him,
just grab him.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.826
It's locked.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:51.786
Shit.

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.079
Check the windows.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.049
-The windows are nailed shut.
-Fuck's sake.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:08.094
-There's got to be a key somewhere.
-[Mother] Here come the Lamingtons.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:10.972
-Stall her!
-How?

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.640
-Just do it.
-Just do it.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.017
Go!

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:17.270
-OK, help me find the key.
-Right.

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:22.817
How's it going?

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.319
Yes, good.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:27.238
-You're going to love these.
-Yeah, I bet.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.782
They look yummy.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:30.825
Well they are, yes.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:36.873
Um... I just... well,
who made your dress?

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.542
It fits you really snugly.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.545
Oh, thank you, Tom.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:45.382
-I actually made the dress myself.
-No way.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:46.549
Yes, way.

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:47.717
[banging]

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.803
-Shh.
-Alright.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:52.639
How many vaginas
do you think a wombat has?

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:54.682
Well I would think
just the one, Tom.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:56.434
No, it's two.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.479
Well, hmm!
That's a lot of vaginas.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.981
Yes, and did you know
Australia has the world's longest fence?

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.442
I got them, I got them, I got them!

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:09.656
Just one more thing.

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:11.282
Yes, Tom?

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.701
-[Graham] No.
-[David] Give it to me.

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.245
What?

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:20.208
[Graham] I've got them in order,
David, alright?

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:26.047
Yes, yes!

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:31.094
Ah... you're barking
up the wrong tree there, mate.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:32.470
We're out!

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.681
[screams]

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.350
[screaming] Leg it!

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.853
[Graham] Run for your life, run!

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:42.021
Tom, help us!

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:46.025
-No, no, no, no.
-No.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:48.361
[screaming]

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:55.160
-[gunshot]
-Oi, Mungus!

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.829
What are you doing,
you dopey cunt?

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.372
But they're taking her.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:02.250
What the fuck are you talking about?
That's their dead friend.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:06.129
Now stop being so rude
and acting like a bloody maniac.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.923
I wasn't gonna hurt anyone.

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:13.261
How do they know that when you're
running around with a fucking machete?

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:19.893
Sorry, guys.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:25.356
Now, you go back inside
and have a lie down.

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:35.200
He's alright, he just gets
a bit funny sometimes.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.993
Oh!

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:39.871
You go and get your clothes
and I'll take you to Perth.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:46.711
<i><font color="white">? Come on tell me ?</font></i>

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:50.215
<i><font color="white">? If you know where she is at ?</font></i>

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.258
<i><font color="white">? How could I see ?</font></i>

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:55.595
<i><font color="white">? Honey dear ?</font></i>

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.597
<i><font color="white">? Can't you hear me calling you ?</font></i>

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.766
<i><font color="white">? I'll soon be there ?</font></i>

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:01.768
How come you're still
wearing that dress?

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:04.145
I shat in my trousers, Maureen.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:09.400
Ooh! One thing I learned getting old,
I never trust a fart.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.363
At last I've got reception.

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:20.203
-[Henry] <i><font color="white">David!</font></i>
-Oh shit, it's Henry.

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:21.913
<i><font color="white">I'm on my way to Perth.</font></i>

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.082
-He's coming to Perth!
-What? When?

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.628
He wants us to deliver Luke
to some funeral home by three o'clock.

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:31.422
Today.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.511
<i><font color="white">? You're hiding</font></i>
<i><font color="white">and you're gonna be found ?</font></i>

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:40.723
<i><font color="white">? I think you know</font></i>
<i><font color="white">what's on my mind ?</font></i>

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.684
<i><font color="white">? You know what I want ?</font></i>

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.326
Grab his legs.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:02.620
Gentle, gentle!

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.582
You totally saved us, Maureen.
I don't know how we can thank you.

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:08.042
That's alright.
You get your friend home.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.296
OK, bye.

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:17.218
[moaning]

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:30.273
[Tom] Graham,
when you've finished...

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.279
[panting]

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:45.912
Graham!

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:52.712
Shit. Henry.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:53.880
Henry's here!

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:55.256
-What?
-He's early.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:08:59.676
-Quick, out of the way.
-What's that?

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.513
[Graham] It's OK, it's alright.
No need to panic.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.893
-Never mind. No, it's OK.
-[woman] This is highly irregular.

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:08.978
Oi!

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.026
Open this door now.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.361
Won't be a minute.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.781
-[Tom] What is this stuff?
-[David] It's paint, just get it off.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:21.448
[chattering]

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.743
David!

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.411
Oh, God. He's going
around the side.

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:27.872
I'm going to count to four.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:28.997
One.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:32.126
David! Have you forgotten
what I said, David?

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:35.587
Jesus, we're never gonna get
this paint off on time. On three.

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:37.173
-Three.
-Three.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.550
Why didn't either of you remember
to do this when we were in the car?

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:42.761
-I didn't realize he was gonna be here.
-It's not like you remembered, David.

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:46.057
That's right, cos I have to remember
everything, as always. Thanks.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:49.268
Being friends with you two is like being
a father to two massive idiot babies.

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:53.606
Tom, open the bloody door.
I'm not angry.

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:55.483
Everything always goes wrong.

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:57.402
Oh, I see. So it's all mine
and Graham's fault, is it?

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:01.406
No, but it would've been easier to deal
with if you weren't so out for yourself.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.032
And if Graham didn't fuck everything up.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:05.618
If Graham's a buffoon and I'm a selfish
prick, then why are we still friends?

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.412
That's a seriously good question.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.288
You don't mean that, David.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.082
Let's just say it crossed my mind.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:13.626
Releasing the feeling
that I am angry.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.336
Releasing the feeling
that I am angry.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.839
Yeah, well you don't really
need us anymore, do you?

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:20.800
-Not since you married that bint.
-Tom.

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:21.926
What?

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:25.722
-Did you just call my wife a bint?
-[banging]

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:29.308
Ah... releasing the feeling,
excuse me, sir.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:31.728
That's a lovely tie.
It's a nice color on your complexion.

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.396
Is there another way
into this building?

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.108
-We need somewhere to put Luke.
-In there.

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:45.074
There's a dead man in here.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:46.743
Just swap them over.

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:48.703
[grunts]

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:03.760
What the fuck is going on?

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.304
Henry.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:09.182
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.687
So, Henry, what made you
come to Perth?

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:17.064
Because I knew
I couldn't trust you fuckwits

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.275
to bring him back in one piece.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.443
Here he is.

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.128
Why has he got a boner?

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.215
It just won't go down.
I'm really sorry.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.592
-We did everything we--
-It's OK.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.929
I'd like to go out with a boner.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.103
His dick's been painted.

01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:58.981
I don't want to know.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.110
Do you think we can still make
the funeral on time?

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.404
We better fucking make it.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.990
I've booked us
on the next flight to London.

01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:11.494
We've got one hour
and 49 minutes to make it.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:16.499
And by the way, one of you fucktards
is gonna need to do the eulogy.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.127
-I'll do it.
-Mmh?

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.547
It's alright.

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:26.050
[woman on PA]
<i><font color="white">This is the final boarding call</font></i>

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.886
<i><font color="white">for Qantas flight QF1</font></i>
<i><font color="white">to London Heathrow.</font></i>

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.472
<i><font color="white">Your flight is now boarding</font></i>
<i><font color="white">at gate 15.</font></i>

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:33.558
<i><font color="white">Would all passengers...</font></i>

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.062
Are you sure it's a good idea
for you to do the eulogy, Graham?

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.022
You're the worst public speaker
in the world.

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:42.692
No I'm not! I'm really good
if I've got time to prepare.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:44.986
-[David] Now, now.
-Hey, it's the Captain.

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:47.864
-You made it.
-That's him.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:51.200
That's that cock-faced prick
that crashed my plane.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:57.957
It's actually a pretty full flight,

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:01.252
so two of you will be upgraded
to business class.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:03.754
What, does that mean
one of us has to fly economy?

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:05.590
I'm afraid so.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:08.426
Oh, great! So how are we
going to sort that out?

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:10.970
Well it's not gonna be me,
that's for sure. I snogged Mungus.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:14.515
-Well, I shagged Maureen.
-Yeah, but you loved it, Graham.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.017
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.185
I didn't, it was disgusting.
-It was not disgusting, you loved it.

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:21.856
Alright. David, thumbs up,
thumbs down. Ready?

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:24.275
-One, two, three.
-No, I'm sitting in economy.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.111
Why?

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.906
Because if sitting in a very
uncomfortable seat for 22 hours

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:32.450
means I get to be away from you two,
then that's good with me.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:35.077
Come on, David. You weren't serious
about all that, were you?

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:37.079
For one thing,
you called my wife a bint.

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:38.998
-Yeah, but--
-Beyond that, I'm sick of the moaning,

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:41.542
the bickering, the squabbling,
the idiocy,

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:43.544
-the shitting in the pants.
-Huh?

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.505
I'm done with all of it!

01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:49.050
Thank you.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.010
David, look.

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:54.263
-We're all tired.
-This isn't working for me anymore.

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:56.223
And it hasn't been for a long time.

01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:00.519
Are you splitting up with us?

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.647
If you want to put it that way, yeah.

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:04.732
That suits me.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.738
-Guys, what--
-Leave it, Graham.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:12.114
He's made up his mind.

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.784
-Have a nice flight.
-Thank you, darling.

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:17.286
Cheers.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:27.630
<i><font color="white">? I remember all the things</font></i>
<i><font color="white">you said to me ?</font></i>

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.426
<i><font color="white">? Never saw the truth ?</font></i>

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:35.262
<i><font color="white">? Through the tears I cried ?</font></i>

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:40.351
<i><font color="white">? I guess it's time to say goodbye ?</font></i>

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.770
<i><font color="white">? Goodbye ?</font></i>

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:51.445
-Have you seen David?
-He's probably here somewhere.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.324
I'm starting to regret
saying I'd do the eulogy.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:56.826
Yeah, of course you bloody are.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.786
Do you even know
what you're gonna say?

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:01.330
I was just gonna say
what a great friend Luke was.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:02.665
Yeah.

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:05.876
And how he had the biggest heart
of anyone I've ever known.

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:07.086
And the biggest cock.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.963
Yeah, I don't think I'll mention that.

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:12.800
He did have a big cock though,
didn't he? Who knew?

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.427
What a bloody waste.

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:17.805
Can you stop talking about
our dead mate's cock, please?

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.724
Shit, I'm getting nervous now.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:22.101
-What are you worried about? Henry?
-Yes!

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.937
And I also thought
if I do a good job with the eulogy,

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.439
maybe David won't be so angry.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.483
I don't think that's gonna
make the difference, Graham.

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.611
What are we going to do then?

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.363
I don't know.

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.241
Fuck, this is going to be
a nightmare.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:42.455
[Tom] Here you are.
Have a toke on this bake-off.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.583
Are you serious? Don't you remember
what happened to me

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.585
last time I took drugs
before a speech?

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:50.254
That was totally different, Graham.
That was coke that got you too high.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.548
This is weed,
it'll just calm you down.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:56.302
-Really?
-Yeah! Yeah, go on. Get it down you.

01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:57.720
We can't do it here.

01:15:57.845 --> 01:16:00.681
Oh, come on, let's go
to that park over the road.

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:02.099
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.271
-Bake off.
-Bake off.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.148
Come on.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:12.568
[organ music]

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.210
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:32.505
-Luke was a great guy.
-Thank you.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:36.801
-Your name's Graham, isn't it?
-No, David.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.929
Luke was always so fond of you,

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:41.972
-Graham.
-David!

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.684
This is Luke's friend Graham.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:49.021
-[man] Hello, Graham.
-[David] It's David.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.856
[man] Graham.

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:54.652
[gasps]

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:18.551
[slurring] Let's sit here.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:29.436
[groaning]

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.315
[gasping]

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.196
-I'm utterly fucked.
-Me too.

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:42.199
That weed's really fucking powerful.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.993
I think it must be laced with something.

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:46.078
It's seriously trippy, man.

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:49.623
Why didn't you tell me how strong
it was before we smoked it?

01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:51.584
I forgot.

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:55.921
-Huh?
-Welcome, everyone.

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:58.424
We'll begin today's service

01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:01.969
with a few words
from Luke's friend, Graham.

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.054
What?

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:06.265
[mumbles]

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:07.683
Fuck!

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:18.736
[Henry growls]

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:20.487
That's not Graham.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.448
[sniggers]

01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:31.540
Hi, everyone.

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:33.250
I'm Graham.

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:35.669
He's not.

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:37.171
What?

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:43.052
Luke and I were friends
for many years,

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:47.723
and during that time
he was always a true friend.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.685
He really cared about people.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.189
And of everyone I've ever known,

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:57.691
he definitely had the biggest cock.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:59.860
-[gasping]
-What was that?

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.197
Heart.

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:06.325
I was meant to say biggest heart.

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:11.038
I mean, it's not like
I ever saw Luke's...

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.290
Well, not fully erect anyway.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:15.876
Well, that's not strictly true, actually,

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:20.965
because when he died,
he had this massive hard-on.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.801
[laughs]

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:35.354
It wasn't that massive.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:37.773
It was more like...

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:39.692
It wasn't like a monster cock.

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:41.402
[laughs]

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:45.531
Sort of thing you see in pornos.

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:47.616
[flatulates]

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:49.034
What?

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:50.244
Monstercocks.com.

01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:51.870
[laughing]

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:59.962
I don't know why I'm laughing.

01:20:00.087 --> 01:20:01.422
I'm really sad.

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.842
[talking muffled with laughter]

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.469
Hello, hello, everyone.

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:13.600
I apologize for my friend Graham here.
I just...

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:15.102
[Graham laughing]

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:20.441
Oh, effing bake.

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:24.111
-What?
-Huh? Huh?

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.074
[clears throat]

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.746
What he was trying to say

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:37.166
is that Luke was
a great friend to all of us,

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:38.834
and we're gonna miss him.

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:44.214
You know, he was kind of
like the glue that kept us together.

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:49.595
And I guess since he's gone,

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.847
things have kind of fallen apart a bit.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:54.224
[crying]

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:57.728
I mean we may have had
our ups and downs,

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:01.273
and none of us are perfect,
far from it,

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:05.402
but we went through a lot together.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.408
And I wouldn't change
our little group

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.410
for anything in the world.

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:16.705
Um...

01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:23.128
Um...

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.757
That's Graham.

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:29.009
Sorry, mate.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:32.888
[Graham] I'm sorry, too.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.686
[laughs]

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:42.314
-Oh, shut up, Graham.
-[Graham] I'm sorry.

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:53.325
Uh...

01:21:56.495 --> 01:22:01.083
I'd just like to add that...
we'll never forget Luke.

01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:07.506
Like Tom said, none of us
are without our foibles,

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:13.011
but true friends accept each other,
even with their flaws,

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:16.265
and Luke...

01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:19.101
was a true friend.

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:21.478
With a large penis.

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:22.938
[gasping]

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:25.107
[growls]

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:26.900
Right!

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:30.112
That's it.

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:31.613
Stop, oi.

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.657
[growls]

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.994
I'm not going to fuck you, David.
I'm going to fuck all of you.

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:39.204
You can't run away from me.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:42.749
Stop! Stop, you lot.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.461
Time for a bollicking.

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:48.130
Oh, you're a slippery fucker.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:51.758
When I get hold of you, you'll wish
you never had an asshole, David.

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:53.719
Graham, stop!

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.013
Where the fuck did they go?

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.141
Fuck.

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:01.059
Shh.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.315
Do you think they've gone?

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.108
We should give it a bit longer,
just in case.

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:09.651
Yeah.

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:12.779
[sniffs]

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.240
Have you shat yourself again,
Graham?

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:17.743
No, just farted.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.996
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.208
Oh, that's really bad.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.293
-[gagging]
-Shh!

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:30.923
[sniffing]

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:35.260
Smelling your own fart
is always nice, isn't it?

01:23:35.385 --> 01:23:37.888
-No.
-No.

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:42.017
-[Henry] Hello.
-[screaming]

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:43.227
[dramatic music]

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:04.988
[clapper] 40 boobs, take one.

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:06.323
Nice board.

01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:09.201
Fucking cunt. Fuck!

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:13.997
Fucking cunt. Fuck!

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.124
Fuck!

01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:18.001
[flies buzzing]

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:26.218
[Mungus] Yes, who's there?

01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:28.428
[laughs]

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:33.099
[chattering]

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:35.644
-Wombats are the worst.
-[Graham] Wombats?

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:37.270
Well, they've got
a two-pronged penis.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.105
A two-pronged penis?

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:41.566
The females have got two vaginas.

01:28:42.526 --> 01:28:45.028
-[Tom] Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.197
[Graham] Don't you remember what
happened the last time I took drugs

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.699
-before a speech?
-That was totally different.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:50.951
Are you serious?

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:53.036
Don't you remember what happened
last time... [babbling].

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:55.205
[babbling]

01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:59.125
He's our friend.

01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:01.503
-Shut up.
-Can you just let me...

01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:03.547
[laughs]

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:05.006
It's not shagging around though, is it?

01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:07.092
It's shagging one person
for a very specific reason.

01:29:07.217 --> 01:29:10.470
And there just happens to be
very mit... mitigating... [babbling].

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:11.596
Do it again.

01:29:12.222 --> 01:29:15.058
Airbus, British wings, British made.

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:18.186
What's happening?

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:20.188
-Hang on.
-Different scene.

01:29:20.313 --> 01:29:22.566
-It's a different scene.
-I thought so, just checking.

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:25.735
The point is, you know,
this would make me really happy

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:28.655
if we could fuck up my lines
any more than I have, fuck!

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:32.909
[laughing]

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:40.125
Do you think, Mark, do you think
Lynette should slap me in the face?

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:41.710
-[Mark] Great.
-Quite hard?

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:44.296
-[Mark] Yes, definitely.
-[Maureen] Do you like it?

01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:47.966
I think we should just... go, slap me,
but just give me a bit more, er...

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:50.051
[Maureen] Why would I do that?
I've never...

01:29:50.176 --> 01:29:52.387
-That's S&M.
-[Mark] Go for it.

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:53.972
[Maureen] Well, I don't even...

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:56.349
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:58.768
You're not a child, Tom,
so you just...

01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:02.105
You're not a child, Tom.

01:30:02.856 --> 01:30:03.898
[laughs]

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:06.776
Shit.

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.612
-Sorry, it's my fault.
-Run.

01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:11.406
Now, that's Kev.
That goes down as Kevin, not me, OK?

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:13.575
It's not me.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:15.160
That's not me. That's not me.

01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:17.287
Seventy-six Anus.

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:19.873
A camera mark.
Take one.

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:23.585
I don't think you heard me
properly, David.

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:27.631
Sorry, I fucked that line up.

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:30.133
So, I don't suppose
we could make a call,

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:33.553
-sort out some transport?
-[Mungus] Yeah, course you can.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.305
Come on inside.

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:54.616
[chuckles]

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.827
[laughing]

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:05.835
That's two massive idiot things.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.880
-Everything always goes wrong.
-Thanks. No. [laughs]

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:13.259
I've no idea what the fuck I'm saying,
but we can A.D.R. it later.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:14.678
Yeah.

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:16.971
You guys should come... Sorry.

01:31:17.097 --> 01:31:18.515
[laughing]

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.392
I just saw your hand go back.

01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:24.562
Oh, nice. It's just there's a...
you know, like... [babbling]

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.650
Moochculus!

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.027
Have you ever met John Travolta?

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.029
[laughs]

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:36.658
-Do you think they've gone?
-We should give it a bit longer,

01:31:36.783 --> 01:31:38.868
-just in case.
-[flatulates]

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:40.578
[sniffs]

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:43.456
[laughing]
