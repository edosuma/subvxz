00:02.098 --> 00:04.589
I got a year to live, Sam.
I'd like to make the most of it.

00:04.767 --> 00:08.268
What do you say we kill some evil
sons of bitches and we raise a little hell?

00:13.319 --> 00:15.607
I know how you feel, Dean. Dad's dead.

00:15.779 --> 00:18.568
And he left a hole,
and it hurts so bad, you can't take it.

00:18.742 --> 00:20.984
I'm okay, okay? The next person
who asks if I'm okay...

00:21.161 --> 00:23.533
...I'm gonna start throwing punches.

00:23.705 --> 00:26.872
- There's no way to save me from the pit?
- No.

00:27.042 --> 00:29.332
You're gonna die.
This is what you're gonna become.

00:29.504 --> 00:31.829
- I don't wanna go to hell.
- We'll find a way to save you.

00:32.006 --> 00:33.500
Let Dean out of his deal right now.

00:33.674 --> 00:36.379
I'm just a saleswoman.
I got a boss like everybody.

00:36.552 --> 00:38.711
- Who holds the contract?
- I can't tell you.

00:41.517 --> 00:43.474
- Tell me what?
- There's a big, new up-and-comer.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.304
- Her name is Lilith.
- Lilith?

00:45.479 --> 00:48.646
And she really, really wants
Sam's intestines on a stick.

00:48.816 --> 00:49.978
You knew about this?

00:50.150 --> 00:52.393
Well, jeez, Sam,
is there anything else I should know?

<i>- Hello?
Ben.</i>

01:45.127 --> 01:47.500
<i>- Linda.
I had to talk to you.</i>

01:47.672 --> 01:50.210
<i>- You can't keep calling here.
I know, I know.</i>

01:50.383 --> 01:52.755
<i>Just... Just tell me
you thought about it, please.</i>

01:52.928 --> 01:54.386
There's nothing to think about.

01:54.554 --> 01:56.132
<i>Don't say that.</i>

01:56.307 --> 01:57.470
I can't.

01:57.642 --> 01:59.681
You know I can't. My wife.

01:59.852 --> 02:02.639
<i>I'm begging you. Come to me.</i>

02:02.813 --> 02:04.438
<i>Come to me, Ben.</i>

02:04.607 --> 02:05.638
No.

02:17.830 --> 02:19.788
Linda, please.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.333
Please, just leave me alone.

02:21.501 --> 02:25.084
<i>I'm not gonna stop. I miss you, Ben.</i>

02:25.255 --> 02:28.090
<i>We could be happy.
We could be happy together.</i>

02:28.258 --> 02:30.832
This is... This is crazy.

02:31.011 --> 02:33.929
<i>I love you. Forever.</i>

02:34.098 --> 02:36.137
<i>Don't you love me?</i>

02:36.725 --> 02:38.683
You know I do.

02:39.061 --> 02:40.889
More than anything.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.359
But...

02:46.361 --> 02:47.939
I'm sorry.

02:48.113 --> 02:49.311
<i>Ben, wait...</i>

03:41.380 --> 03:43.206
Okay, Linda.

03:45.009 --> 03:46.587
You win.

03:52.392 --> 03:53.423
I'm coming.

04:05.656 --> 04:09.702
Yep. I got it. Okay, bye.

04:10.954 --> 04:12.365
So?

04:12.539 --> 04:14.615
So the professor doesn't know crap.

04:14.791 --> 04:16.250
Shocking. Pack your panties, Sammy.

04:16.418 --> 04:17.961
- We're hitting the road.
- What's up?

04:18.129 --> 04:21.913
That was Bobby. Some banker guy
blew his head off in Ohio...

04:22.091 --> 04:24.048
...and he thinks
there's a spirit involved.

04:24.218 --> 04:25.629
So you two were talking a case?

04:25.803 --> 04:28.045
No, we were, uh,
we were talking about our feelings.

04:28.222 --> 04:30.714
And then our favorite boy bands.
Yeah, we were talking a case.

04:30.893 --> 04:33.218
- So a spirit...? What?
- A banker was complaining...

04:33.395 --> 04:36.230
...about some electrical problems
at his pad for like a week.

04:36.398 --> 04:39.566
Phones going haywire.
Computers flipping on and off. Eh?

04:40.945 --> 04:43.401
- Uh-huh.
- This is not ringing your bell?

04:43.573 --> 04:46.740
Well, sure, yeah.
But, Dean, we're on a case.

04:47.410 --> 04:48.988
- Whose?
- Yours.

04:49.454 --> 04:51.993
Right, yeah. Well, could have fooled me.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.708
What else
have we been doing lately...

04:53.876 --> 04:57.079
...other than trying to break your deal?
- Chasing our tails, that's what.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.800
Sam, we've talked to every professor,
witch, soothsayer...

05:00.967 --> 05:04.751
...and two-bit carny act in the lower 48.
Nobody knows squat.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.088
And we can't find Bela.
We can't find the Colt.

05:07.265 --> 05:10.469
So until we actually find something,
I'd like to do my job.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.055
- There's one thing we haven't tried.
- No, Sam...

05:13.231 --> 05:15.058
- We should summon Ruby.
- I'm not gonna fight...

05:15.233 --> 05:17.391
- She says she knows how to save you.
- Well, she can't.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.731
- Oh, you know for sure?
- I do.

05:18.903 --> 05:20.647
- How?
- Because she told me, okay?

05:24.159 --> 05:26.366
- What?
- She told me...

05:26.787 --> 05:27.818
...flat out...

05:27.997 --> 05:30.701
...that she could not save me.
Nobody can.

05:34.212 --> 05:36.086
And you just neglected
to mention this to me?

05:36.256 --> 05:38.925
I really don't care what that bitch thinks
and neither should you.

05:39.092 --> 05:40.551
Now you're keeping secrets from me?

05:40.719 --> 05:43.554
You really wanna talk about
who's keeping secrets from who?

05:49.896 --> 05:52.387
- Now where you going?
- Guess I'm going to Ohio.

06:06.873 --> 06:10.456
I found him there.

06:10.835 --> 06:13.540
Why don't you just tell us
everything you saw, Mrs. Waters?

06:14.589 --> 06:16.416
You mean besides my dead husband?

06:16.591 --> 06:20.672
Just everything else you saw, please.

06:22.932 --> 06:26.182
There was blood everywhere.

06:27.102 --> 06:29.939
The phone was ripped from the wall,
his favorite Scotch on the desk.

06:30.107 --> 06:31.565
What else could you wanna know?

06:31.733 --> 06:33.477
Why was the phone
ripped from the wall?

06:33.652 --> 06:35.775
- I don't know.
- You mind if I take a look?

06:38.115 --> 06:40.689
I already went over all this
with the other detectives.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.276
We'll be out of your hair
in no time, ma'am.

06:48.209 --> 06:50.119
Ma'am, what time did your husband die?

06:50.796 --> 06:52.255
Sometime after 11.

06:58.303 --> 06:59.963
What about strange phone calls?

07:00.473 --> 07:03.723
Receive any of those lately? Weird
interference, static, anything like that?

07:03.893 --> 07:05.304
No.

07:06.146 --> 07:07.688
No.

07:08.148 --> 07:11.981
Mrs. Waters, withholding information
from the police is a capital offense.

07:16.282 --> 07:18.524
In some parts of the world, I'm sure.

07:21.329 --> 07:24.781
A couple of weeks ago,
uh, there was this...

07:24.958 --> 07:25.989
This what?

07:27.377 --> 07:28.492
I woke up one morning.

07:28.670 --> 07:32.086
I heard Ben in his study.
I thought he was talking to a woman.

07:32.257 --> 07:35.343
- What made you think that?
- Because he kept calling her Linda.

07:35.511 --> 07:37.171
The thing is...

07:37.847 --> 07:41.845
...I picked up the other line
and nobody was there.

07:42.018 --> 07:43.216
Ben was talking to nobody.

07:43.394 --> 07:45.684
There was nothing?
- Just static.

07:47.524 --> 07:49.019
You ever speak to Ben about this?

07:49.193 --> 07:52.396
- No. I should've, but no.
- Did he ever say who Linda was?

07:52.571 --> 07:55.657
What difference does it make?
There was no one on the other end.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.702
Linda's a babe. Or was.

08:04.876 --> 08:06.786
- Find her?
- Yeah, Linda Bateman.

08:06.963 --> 08:09.288
She and, uh, Ben Waters
were high-school sweethearts.

08:09.465 --> 08:11.374
- What happened?
- Drunk driver hit them head on.

08:11.551 --> 08:12.796
Ben walked away.

08:12.969 --> 08:15.341
So, what then? Dead flame calls to chat?

08:15.513 --> 08:16.545
You would think.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.682
But Linda was cremated.

08:18.851 --> 08:21.057
So why is she still floating around?

08:22.479 --> 08:25.599
- Uh, you got me.
- What about that, uh, caller ID?

08:25.774 --> 08:27.400
Turns out it's a phone number.

08:27.569 --> 08:29.027
No phone number I've ever seen.

08:29.195 --> 08:32.232
Yeah, because it's about a century old,
from back when phones had cranks.

08:32.407 --> 08:34.198
So why use that number to reach out?

08:34.366 --> 08:36.905
Got me there too, but either way,
we should run a trace on it.

08:37.078 --> 08:39.321
How are we gonna trace a number
over 100 years old?

08:39.498 --> 08:41.787
We don't get too many folks from HQ
down here.

08:41.958 --> 08:45.375
Yes, well, the main office mentioned
that there would be a lunch.

08:45.546 --> 08:46.957
I'm sure we can arrange something.

08:48.549 --> 08:50.875
The man you gentlemen
wanna be speaking to is right this...

08:51.887 --> 08:53.049
I know. Sorry.

08:53.221 --> 08:57.089
Uh, got something of a hygiene issue
down here, if you ask me.

08:59.394 --> 09:00.426
Stewie?

09:00.605 --> 09:02.728
Ah, uh, uh...
What did I tell you...

09:02.899 --> 09:06.065
...about keeping this place clean?
Spam mail. Spam mail.

09:06.235 --> 09:07.315
Stewie Meyers.

09:07.487 --> 09:10.357
- Mr. Campbell, Mr. Raimi.
- I don't know how all this got here.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.280
From headquarters.

09:14.453 --> 09:15.698
Oh.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.113
- Give the gentlemen whatever they need.
- Yeah.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.165
Thank you.
Thanks.

09:21.335 --> 09:23.791
So can I help you?

09:24.506 --> 09:26.913
- Is that, uh, BustyAsianBeauties. Com?
No.

09:27.092 --> 09:29.298
<i>Ooh, me so horny.</i>

09:29.469 --> 09:31.094
- Maybe.
Word to the wise.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.472
Platinum membership.
Worth every penny. Huh?

09:33.641 --> 09:35.930
Right, anyway.
Um, we're here to trace a number.

09:37.853 --> 09:39.513
- Where did you get this?
- Off caller ID.

09:39.689 --> 09:42.606
- Oh, no. That's impossible.
- Hasn't been used in years, we know.

09:42.775 --> 09:46.275
A few years? It's prehistoric. Trust me,
nobody's using this number anymore.

09:46.446 --> 09:48.569
- Sure. Could you run it anyway?
Sure.

09:48.740 --> 09:51.825
Why don't I just rearrange
my whole life first?

09:52.870 --> 09:55.077
Listen, uh, Stewie.

09:55.248 --> 09:58.332
You got, like, six kinds
of employee-code violations down here...

09:58.501 --> 10:01.586
...not to mention the sickening porn
clogging up your hard drive.

10:03.173 --> 10:07.123
When my partner says run the number,
I suggest you run the number.

10:17.022 --> 10:19.892
Okay. Whatever. Jeez.

10:23.195 --> 10:24.855
- Holy crap.
- What?

10:25.030 --> 10:28.067
I can't tell you
where the number comes from.

10:28.534 --> 10:31.369
But I can tell you where it's been going.

10:32.205 --> 10:33.747
What do you mean?

10:35.875 --> 10:38.497
Ten different houses
in the past two weeks...

10:38.670 --> 10:40.628
...all got calls from the same number.

10:50.558 --> 10:52.884
So are we done here?

10:53.061 --> 10:55.054
Because I was sort of busy.

10:56.773 --> 10:58.232
Right.

11:26.014 --> 11:27.093
Yeah?

11:27.265 --> 11:29.507
Hello, sir. I'm with the phone company.

11:29.684 --> 11:32.437
- We didn't, uh, call the phone company.
- Oh, no, sir.

11:32.605 --> 11:36.305
No, we're calling you. We've had a lot of
complaints from the neighborhood.

11:36.483 --> 11:37.515
- Complaints?
- Yes, sir.

11:37.693 --> 11:39.686
Um, dropped calls, static.

11:39.862 --> 11:42.983
Maybe even strange voices
on the other end of the line.

11:43.158 --> 11:44.949
No, we haven't had any of that here.

11:45.118 --> 11:47.075
- Nothing?
- No.

11:47.245 --> 11:49.783
Okay, uh, great.
Just thought we'd check.

11:49.956 --> 11:51.616
- Thanks.
- No problem.

11:51.791 --> 11:54.544
Okay, let's go. Come on, Simon.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.676
No way you work
for the phone company.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.974
- Sure I do.
- Since when does a phone guy...

12:14.149 --> 12:16.902
...drive a rental or wear a cheap suit?

12:20.782 --> 12:24.732
Yeah?
Well, maybe we're both keeping secrets.

12:27.498 --> 12:29.740
Why'd you ask my dad
if we heard strange voices?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.376
- Why, did you hear something?
- No.

12:31.544 --> 12:34.331
- My mistake. Thought maybe you did.
- Well, I didn't, okay?

12:35.381 --> 12:37.588
Okay. Sorry to bother you.

12:44.683 --> 12:45.845
Because, you know...

12:47.811 --> 12:51.263
...if you did,
then I would have told you...

12:51.441 --> 12:54.014
...that I've been
right where you're standing right now.

12:55.778 --> 13:00.987
Hearing things, even seeing things
that couldn't be explained.

13:02.036 --> 13:05.321
Maybe I would have been able
to help out a little bit.

13:07.833 --> 13:08.864
Anyways...

13:11.129 --> 13:12.754
Hey, wait.

13:14.716 --> 13:16.210
Maybe...

13:18.345 --> 13:22.011
Maybe I've been talking on the phone,
with...

13:22.892 --> 13:23.971
With my mom.

13:26.062 --> 13:27.342
Well, that's not so strange.

13:27.521 --> 13:30.725
She's dead. Like, three years now dead.

13:31.568 --> 13:32.897
How often does she call you?

13:34.321 --> 13:35.352
A few times.

13:36.281 --> 13:38.653
It started a week ago.

13:39.201 --> 13:41.822
I thought I was, like, crazy or something.

13:43.081 --> 13:44.954
Well, I can tell you one thing for sure.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.912
And you're gonna have to go with me
on this, okay?

13:48.294 --> 13:49.492
You're not crazy.

13:54.468 --> 13:56.757
- Yeah.
- Stiffs are calling people all over town.

13:56.929 --> 13:59.218
- Tell me about it.
- I just talked to a grandmother...

13:59.390 --> 14:01.299
...who's having phone sex
with her husband...

14:01.475 --> 14:02.554
<i>- ... who died in Korea.
- Ew.</i>

14:02.726 --> 14:05.016
Completely rocked
my understanding of necrophilia.

14:06.398 --> 14:08.521
<i>So, what the hell's going on here, Dean?</i>

14:08.692 --> 14:12.025
Beats me, but we better find out soon.
This place is turning into spook central.

14:12.195 --> 14:15.233
- Yeah. All right, I'll call you later.
- Yeah.

14:19.287 --> 14:20.318
Yeah, what?

14:21.706 --> 14:23.533
<i>- Sam?
Dean.</i>

14:26.003 --> 14:28.042
<i>Dean, is that you?</i>

14:28.213 --> 14:29.672
Dad?

14:35.604 --> 14:37.811
I mean, Dad?

14:38.608 --> 14:40.684
You really think it was Dad?

14:40.860 --> 14:42.769
I don't know. Maybe.

14:43.696 --> 14:45.772
Well, what did he sound like?

14:46.699 --> 14:49.737
Like Oprah. It was Dad,
he sounded like Dad, what do you think?

14:49.912 --> 14:51.074
What did he say?

14:51.830 --> 14:52.910
My name.

14:53.082 --> 14:54.280
That's it?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.451
Yeah, the call dropped out.

14:59.547 --> 15:01.207
Why would he even call
in the first place?

15:01.383 --> 15:04.467
I don't know, man. Why are ghosts
calling anybody in this town?

15:05.428 --> 15:07.551
But other people are hearing
from their loved ones.

15:07.722 --> 15:10.095
Why can't we?
It's at least a possibility, right?

15:13.312 --> 15:14.475
Yeah, I guess.

15:17.108 --> 15:18.899
Okay, so what if...?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.613
What if it really is Dad?

15:25.158 --> 15:26.653
What happens if he calls back?

15:27.327 --> 15:28.821
What do you mean?

15:29.871 --> 15:30.903
What do I say?

15:32.333 --> 15:33.993
- Hello.
- Hello?

15:35.503 --> 15:37.579
That's what you come back with? Hello?

15:37.755 --> 15:39.298
Uh...

15:43.762 --> 15:44.925
Hello?

15:58.862 --> 16:00.142
Find anything?

16:00.322 --> 16:03.655
After three hours,
I have found no reason...

16:03.826 --> 16:06.993
...why anything supernatural
would be going on here.

16:07.163 --> 16:08.787
Wow, you'd think
a Stanford education...

16:08.956 --> 16:12.325
...and a high-school hookup rate of 0.0
would produce better results than that.

16:12.502 --> 16:13.533
Hilarious.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.001
Sam, you're just looking
in the wrong places, pal.

16:16.173 --> 16:18.379
And what are the right places, Dean?

16:19.176 --> 16:21.667
The motel pamphlet rack.

16:21.845 --> 16:24.134
Milan, Ohio.
Birthplace of Thomas Edison.

16:24.306 --> 16:25.885
Yeah, right. So what?

16:26.059 --> 16:27.470
Keep reading.

16:35.735 --> 16:37.396
You're kidding.

16:37.989 --> 16:39.946
And we're walking.

16:40.116 --> 16:44.445
And here we have one of the museum's
most unique and treasured possessions:

16:44.620 --> 16:47.373
Thomas Edison's "spirit phone. "

16:47.541 --> 16:48.869
Did you know that Mr. Edison...

16:49.042 --> 16:51.367
...while being one of America's
most beloved inventors...

16:51.545 --> 16:54.665
...was also a devout "occultist"?
Ooh!

16:54.840 --> 16:56.583
What's with the quote-y fingers?

16:56.758 --> 16:59.381
He spent years
working on this, his final invention...

16:59.554 --> 17:03.504
...which he was convinced could be used
to "communicate" with the "dead. "

17:03.683 --> 17:05.224
Pretty spooky, huh?

17:05.935 --> 17:09.601
And we're walking. We are walking.
We're walking.

17:10.023 --> 17:11.434
And we're not touching that.

17:11.608 --> 17:13.849
And we're walking. And stop.

17:15.237 --> 17:16.731
Anything?

17:17.114 --> 17:18.773
Nothing.

17:19.742 --> 17:20.773
What do you think?

17:22.037 --> 17:24.872
Honestly, it kind of looks like
an old pile of junk to me.

17:26.540 --> 17:29.246
- It's not even plugged in.
- Maybe it didn't work like that.

17:29.419 --> 17:30.617
Okay.

17:30.963 --> 17:34.546
Maybe it's like a radio tower, you know?
Broadcasting the dead all over town.

17:34.717 --> 17:37.290
- Could be.
- The caller ID is 100 years old, right?

17:37.470 --> 17:40.803
- Around the time this thing was built.
- But why would it start working now?

17:40.973 --> 17:42.634
I don't know.

17:42.976 --> 17:46.760
But as long as the moldy are calling
the freshes, it's the best reason we got.

17:46.939 --> 17:48.053
Yeah, maybe.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.106
So maybe it really is Dad.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.670
<i>- Dad?
Dean.</i>

18:11.841 --> 18:13.121
Is it really you?

18:13.300 --> 18:14.844
<i>It's me.</i>

18:16.680 --> 18:19.218
<i>- How can I be sure?
You can't.</i>

18:19.391 --> 18:21.882
<i>- Dean, how could you do it?
- Do what?</i>

18:23.270 --> 18:24.847
<i>Sell your soul.</i>

18:25.023 --> 18:29.400
<i>- I was looking after Sam, like you said to.
I never wanted this, never.</i>

18:29.569 --> 18:31.561
<i>You're my boy. I love you.</i>

18:31.738 --> 18:35.023
<i>- I can't watch you go to hell, Dean.
- I'm sorry.</i>

18:35.199 --> 18:36.481
I don't know how to stop it.

18:36.660 --> 18:39.198
<i>Because if you break the deal,
Sam dies, right?</i>

18:39.371 --> 18:40.865
<i>- What?
Well, I know a way out.</i>

18:41.040 --> 18:42.415
<i>- For both of you.
- How?</i>

18:42.583 --> 18:44.374
<i>The demon who holds your contract.</i>

18:44.543 --> 18:47.462
<i>He's here. Now.</i>

20:54.986 --> 20:56.528
What's up?

20:56.696 --> 21:00.315
Girl, Lanie, her mom's ghost
spooked her out pretty bad last night.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.201
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

21:02.369 --> 21:04.943
- What are you doing?
- I think Dad's right.

21:05.122 --> 21:07.162
I think the demon is here.

21:08.085 --> 21:09.662
Check it out.

21:14.007 --> 21:17.008
- What is this, weather reports?
- Omens. Demonic omens.

21:17.177 --> 21:20.464
Electrical storms everywhere we've been
for the past two weeks.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.679
I don't remember any lightning storms.

21:23.226 --> 21:25.931
I don't remember you
studying meteorology as a kid, either.

21:26.104 --> 21:28.262
But I'm telling you,
that bastard's been tailing me...

21:28.439 --> 21:30.148
...wearing some poor dude's meat.

21:31.735 --> 21:34.772
And it's following you because...?

21:34.947 --> 21:38.814
I guess I'm big game, you know?
My ass is too sweet to let out of sight.

21:39.159 --> 21:40.191
Okay, sure.

21:42.289 --> 21:45.206
Don't get too excited, Sammy.
Might pull something.

21:46.543 --> 21:49.378
- Dean, I wanna believe this. I really do...
- Then believe it.

21:50.463 --> 21:53.750
- Lf we get this sucker, it's Miller Time.
- Yeah, that's another thing.

21:53.926 --> 21:56.168
Dad rattles off an exorcism
that can kill a demon.

21:56.345 --> 22:00.046
- Not just send it back to hell, but kill it?
- I've checked it out.

22:00.224 --> 22:02.550
This is heavy-duty Dark Ages.

22:02.728 --> 22:04.519
Fifteenth century.

22:04.855 --> 22:08.105
Yeah, I checked on it too, Dean.
And so did Bobby.

22:10.485 --> 22:11.944
Okay. And?

22:12.112 --> 22:14.687
Look, it definitely is an exorcism, okay?

22:14.866 --> 22:18.116
There's just no evidence
that it can kill a demon.

22:18.286 --> 22:20.029
- No evidence it can't.
- Oh, Dean, come on...

22:20.205 --> 22:23.371
Hey, as far as I know, the only one of us
that's actually been to hell is Dad.

22:23.541 --> 22:26.460
Maybe he picked up a couple of tricks
there, like which exorcisms work.

22:26.629 --> 22:27.660
Maybe it does, okay?

22:27.838 --> 22:30.508
- I hope it does too, but we gotta be sure.
- Why aren't we sure?

22:30.674 --> 22:33.344
Because I don't know
what's going on around here, Dean.

22:33.511 --> 22:37.177
I mean, some guy blows his brains out,
a little girl is scared out of her wits.

22:37.349 --> 22:40.136
Wow, man, a couple of civvies
are freaked out by some ghosts.

22:40.310 --> 22:43.430
News flash, Sam, people are supposed
to be freaked out by ghosts.

22:48.861 --> 22:51.648
- Dad tell you where to find the demon?
- I'm waiting on the call.

22:54.867 --> 22:56.944
I told Lanie I'd stop by.

22:58.580 --> 22:59.612
Oh, good, yeah.

22:59.790 --> 23:03.123
No, you go hang out with jailbait.
Just, uh, watch out for Chris Hansen.

23:03.293 --> 23:07.208
Meanwhile, I'll be here, you know,
getting ready to save my life.

23:11.052 --> 23:13.377
You are unbelievable, you know that?

23:13.555 --> 23:16.390
I mean, for months we've been trying
to break this demon deal.

23:16.558 --> 23:18.052
Dad's about to give us the address...

23:18.227 --> 23:21.347
...and you can't accept it? He's dead
and you're still butting heads.

23:21.522 --> 23:23.147
- That's not what it's about.
- Then what?

23:23.315 --> 23:26.103
The fact is,
we got no hard proof here, Dean.

23:26.277 --> 23:29.148
After everything,
you're still just going on blind faith.

23:29.323 --> 23:32.738
Yeah, well, maybe.
You know, maybe that's all I got, okay?

23:37.205 --> 23:38.664
Please.

23:39.666 --> 23:43.499
Just please don't go anywhere
until I get back, okay, Dean?

23:43.671 --> 23:45.296
Please.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.820
Have you told your father
about any of this?

24:09.991 --> 24:11.735
And bother him at work?

24:11.910 --> 24:12.942
No.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.446
He wouldn't believe me.
He'd just chuck me into therapy.

24:15.623 --> 24:17.201
So, what did your mother say?

24:18.584 --> 24:19.782
That she wanted to see me.

24:19.961 --> 24:22.368
So at first I thought
I was supposed to go to the cemetery.

24:22.797 --> 24:24.956
- Did you?
- Nothing happened.

24:28.137 --> 24:30.758
But then she started
asking me to do other things.

24:31.265 --> 24:32.593
What sort of things?

24:34.644 --> 24:35.675
Bad things.

24:54.832 --> 24:57.122
Hello? Simon Greenfield speaking.

24:58.795 --> 25:00.171
Hi, Mommy.

25:00.338 --> 25:03.505
Yeah, I wanna see you. Where are you?

25:12.018 --> 25:13.263
<i>- Dad?
Dean.</i>

25:13.436 --> 25:14.716
Where's the demon?

25:15.313 --> 25:17.021
Lanie, please.

25:17.190 --> 25:20.026
Tell me what happened.
It's very important.

25:20.194 --> 25:23.029
Mom told me to go
to Dad's medicine cabinet.

25:23.197 --> 25:24.311
And?

25:24.490 --> 25:27.823
Take his sleeping pills.
Take all his sleeping pills.

25:27.993 --> 25:30.319
She wanted you to kill yourself?

25:33.875 --> 25:36.876
Why would my mom want me to do that?

25:37.045 --> 25:38.456
I don't know.

25:38.630 --> 25:41.834
I mean, just so I could come to her?

25:43.344 --> 25:44.423
What'd you say?

25:44.595 --> 25:45.924
She wanted me to come to her.

25:46.097 --> 25:48.173
No, no, no. How did she say it exactly?

25:48.349 --> 25:51.102
"Come to me. " Like, a million times.

25:55.566 --> 25:57.024
Lanie.

25:57.484 --> 25:58.765
That's not your mother.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.591
Listen to me. Don't answer the phone.
Don't use the computer.

26:29.769 --> 26:32.605
Don't do anything
unless I say to, all right?

26:33.900 --> 26:35.310
Lanie.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.479
Where's Simon?

26:53.545 --> 26:55.123
Hello?

27:33.631 --> 27:34.662
Dean, it's not Dad.

27:34.841 --> 27:36.584
<i>What is it?
- A crocotta.</i>

27:36.759 --> 27:38.919
<i>That a sandwich?
- Scavenger. Mimics loved ones.</i>

27:39.096 --> 27:40.127
Whispers, "Come to me. "

27:40.306 --> 27:42.512
Then lures you into the dark
and swallows your soul.

27:42.683 --> 27:44.426
<i>Crocotta, right. That makes sense.</i>

27:45.811 --> 27:48.219
<i>- I'm sorry, man.
Don't these things live in filth?</i>

27:48.397 --> 27:51.565
<i>- Yeah.
The flies at the phone company.</i>

28:30.944 --> 28:33.233
<i>It's Herman Munster. Leave a message.</i>

28:33.823 --> 28:36.492
Dean, I'm in the parking lot.
He's here. Hurry.

28:45.669 --> 28:46.700
Whoa, what the hell?

28:46.878 --> 28:48.670
- I know what you are.
- Wait, mister.

28:48.839 --> 28:51.875
- And I know how to kill you.
- Please. Okay, wait, wait.

28:52.050 --> 28:54.969
If we're overcharging you
for the call waiting or something...

28:55.138 --> 28:57.344
...I can fix that, I'm your friend.

28:57.515 --> 29:00.635
Please. Just... Just don't kill me.

29:01.185 --> 29:02.893
Don't kill me, please.

29:06.692 --> 29:08.234
Yeah, ha, ha.

29:08.402 --> 29:12.316
That's what happens when you mess
with the phone company, dillweed.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.481
Thank you, Clark.

29:18.580 --> 29:19.694
Forget about it.

29:21.207 --> 29:22.583
Clark?

29:33.688 --> 29:38.102
L... I'm sorry, Clark.
I'm sorry for whatever I did to you.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.020
- I'm sorry. Please...
Wait.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.937
Wait. Don't do it.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.823
You're awake.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.697
You're not a killer, Clark. No.

29:48.579 --> 29:52.364
There's a good man inside of you.
I know it.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.666
What do you think, Sammy?

29:55.253 --> 29:56.664
Am I a good man?

29:56.838 --> 29:58.213
Just let him go.

29:59.632 --> 30:02.919
I would. I really would.

30:03.304 --> 30:05.759
If only I'd had more than a salad
for lunch.

30:06.182 --> 30:07.724
You see?

30:08.225 --> 30:09.305
I'm starving.

30:09.477 --> 30:10.936
No!

30:43.890 --> 30:45.930
My last call with Dean...

30:46.726 --> 30:48.304
...that was you.

30:48.728 --> 30:50.306
You led me here.

30:53.233 --> 30:57.232
Some calls I make, some calls I take.

30:57.905 --> 31:02.117
But you have to admit,
I had you fooled for a while.

31:02.952 --> 31:05.705
All that Edison phone crap.

31:06.915 --> 31:08.623
Oh, well.

31:12.963 --> 31:13.994
What are you doing?

31:17.093 --> 31:19.086
I'm killing your brother.

31:20.138 --> 31:22.629
Or maybe I'm killing another guy.

31:23.433 --> 31:25.722
We'll just have to see how it goes.

31:39.242 --> 31:41.318
<i>- Hello?
Hi, Daddy.</i>

31:43.288 --> 31:44.913
Hey, baby.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.243
I thought you said
you weren't gonna call anymore.

31:49.420 --> 31:51.543
<i>I know, Daddy.</i>

31:52.423 --> 31:55.093
You know how sad
this makes your old man.

31:57.303 --> 31:59.712
How upset I was at your funeral.

31:59.890 --> 32:03.508
<i>I had to call.
I know who killed me, Daddy.</i>

32:04.728 --> 32:06.009
What?

32:06.188 --> 32:09.604
<i>The man who killed me.
He's at the house right now.</i>

32:09.775 --> 32:12.349
What? What are you saying to me?

32:12.529 --> 32:16.740
<i>He's at the house, Daddy.
He wants to kill you too.</i>

32:25.501 --> 32:27.707
You know, mimicking Dean's one thing.

32:27.878 --> 32:30.666
But my dad, that's a hell of a trick.

32:31.007 --> 32:34.377
Well, once I made you two as hunters,
it was easy.

32:38.015 --> 32:39.639
Found Dean's number...

32:39.808 --> 32:43.178
...then your number,
then your father's numbers.

32:43.730 --> 32:47.644
Then to e-mails, voice mails.

32:47.817 --> 32:49.015
Everything.

32:49.861 --> 32:53.561
You see, people think
that that stuff just gets erased.

32:53.741 --> 32:55.484
But it doesn't.

32:55.910 --> 32:59.859
You'd be surprised at how much
of yourself is just floating out there...

33:00.748 --> 33:03.321
...waiting to be plucked.

33:03.501 --> 33:05.909
Dean's not gonna fall for this.

33:07.214 --> 33:08.708
He's not gonna kill that guy.

33:09.090 --> 33:11.416
Then the guy kills him.

34:29.887 --> 34:31.880
Technology.

34:35.018 --> 34:37.389
Makes life so much easier.

34:39.606 --> 34:45.027
Used to be I'd hide in the woods
for days, weeks...

34:45.196 --> 34:47.353
...whispering to people.

34:48.241 --> 34:50.862
Trying to draw them out into the night.

34:52.245 --> 34:54.534
But they had community.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.661
They all looked out after each other.

34:57.835 --> 35:01.085
I'd be lucky to eat maybe one,
two souls a year.

35:02.005 --> 35:06.300
But now when I'm hungry,
I simply make a phone call.

35:06.469 --> 35:09.043
You're all so connected.

35:10.431 --> 35:13.267
But you've never been so alone.

35:50.601 --> 35:52.843
- What is this?
- Your funeral.

36:01.571 --> 36:04.109
You do this to my daughter too?

36:05.241 --> 36:08.112
- How the hell did you get out?
- You do this to my daughter too?

36:08.286 --> 36:10.079
- Wait. This is a mistake.
- You killed her.

36:10.247 --> 36:12.406
- No. Wait.
- You killed her, you son of a bitch.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.162
She was 9 years old!

36:53.336 --> 36:54.879
Stop. I didn't.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.006
You gotta believe me.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.839
Why did you kill her?

37:07.018 --> 37:08.429
I'm sorry.

37:08.853 --> 37:10.228
I didn't kill your daughter.

37:12.523 --> 37:14.647
Then what are you doing here?

37:18.405 --> 37:20.149
I don't know.

37:34.789 --> 37:37.197
I see they improved your face.

37:38.585 --> 37:40.412
Yeah, right back at you.

37:45.217 --> 37:46.960
So crocotta, huh?

37:47.135 --> 37:48.168
Yep.

37:48.346 --> 37:50.137
That would explain the flies.

37:50.306 --> 37:51.884
Yeah, it would.

37:55.186 --> 37:57.095
Hey, um...

37:57.814 --> 37:59.854
Look, I'm sorry it wasn't Dad.

38:01.443 --> 38:03.317
No, I gave you a hell of a time
on this one.

38:03.487 --> 38:05.645
- Ahh.
- No, you were right.

38:05.823 --> 38:07.531
Forget about it.

38:09.034 --> 38:10.198
I can't.

38:12.289 --> 38:15.788
I wanted to believe so badly
that there was a way out of this.

38:17.752 --> 38:20.671
I mean, I'm staring down
the barrel at this thing.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.793
You know, hell.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.672
For real, forever. And I'm just...

38:28.180 --> 38:29.212
Yeah.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.476
I'm scared, Sam.

38:37.024 --> 38:38.518
I'm really scared.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.986
I know.

38:45.825 --> 38:48.446
I guess I was willing to believe anything.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.696
You know, last act of a desperate man.

38:50.872 --> 38:55.167
- There's nothing wrong with having hope.
- No. Hope doesn't get you jack squat.

38:55.419 --> 38:59.666
I can't expect Dad to show up
with some miracle at the last minute.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.378
I can't expect anybody to, you know?

39:04.054 --> 39:07.174
And the only person
that can get me out of this thing is me.

39:10.811 --> 39:12.388
And me.

39:17.110 --> 39:19.779
- "And me"?
- What?

39:19.946 --> 39:23.611
Deep revelation, having a real moment,
that's what you come back with?

39:23.783 --> 39:25.492
"And me"?

39:25.953 --> 39:27.613
- Do you want a poem?
- Moment's gone.

39:30.833 --> 39:32.742
Unbelievable.

39:34.378 --> 39:36.870
<i>- So must I. I have a lot of work to do.</i>

39:37.048 --> 39:39.373
<i>At this rate, it won't take long.</i>

39:39.551 --> 39:42.587
<i>You'll have everything tidied up
and be off before we get used to you.</i>

39:42.762 --> 39:45.929
<i>Oh, I'll be around long enough
for you and I to, uh...</i>

39:47.309 --> 39:48.341
<i>I'll be around.</i>
