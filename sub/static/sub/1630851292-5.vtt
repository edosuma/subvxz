10:58.492 --> 11:00.808
We had a deal.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.385
No, I know.
(stammers) But I just...

11:02.478 --> 11:03.644
I d-- I don't-- I don't think...

11:03.738 --> 11:06.313
Boy, this is really gonna hurt
your reputation

11:06.333 --> 11:08.833
with my kindergarten friends.

11:08.985 --> 11:10.669
You have kindergarten friends?

11:10.854 --> 11:11.911
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.580
I let them throw pinecones at me
all the time.

11:14.675 --> 11:18.009
But now I'm gonna have to
tell them you welshed on me.

11:18.236 --> 11:21.513
(sucks teeth)
Kindergartners hate welshers.

11:21.664 --> 11:23.181
Kindergartners, eh?

11:23.408 --> 11:25.091
You know what? I'll do it.

11:25.243 --> 11:26.242
Good choice, Stewie.

11:26.335 --> 11:28.411
Hey,
m-maybe after all this is done,

11:28.430 --> 11:31.022
I-I could get kindergartners
throwing pinecones at me?

11:31.249 --> 11:33.174
(chuckles):
Whoa, slow down, champ.

11:33.268 --> 11:35.652
They start you
at driveway pebbles.

11:40.516 --> 11:42.683
Ah, Brian, just the man
I was hoping to see.

11:42.777 --> 11:44.202
You don't like cats, do you?

11:44.353 --> 11:46.079
-I hate 'em.
-Sit.

11:48.024 --> 11:50.357
Three of Lois'
sweaty jogging bras.

11:50.452 --> 11:52.769
Have I really been
that good of a boy?

11:52.787 --> 11:54.454
Depends. I got a cat problem.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.363
You get rid of my cat,
this is all yours.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.608
-Done.
-Go ahead, boy.

11:58.626 --> 12:01.035
(sniffing)

12:01.054 --> 12:02.887
Oh, yeah!

12:03.114 --> 12:05.724
She ran fast
because Bonnie was watching.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.105
-What happened to you?
-I'm not really sure.

12:12.215 --> 12:14.640
I was in line at the bank,
and this human-sized chicken

12:14.793 --> 12:15.959
cut in front of me.

12:16.052 --> 12:17.627
Well,
I wasn't gonna let that stand.

12:17.645 --> 12:18.795
I had a weird day, too.

12:18.813 --> 12:20.146
I asked, like, seven people

12:20.298 --> 12:22.240
if they were gonna watch
the SpaceX launch.

12:22.391 --> 12:23.967
And I-I don't even know
what that is.

12:24.060 --> 12:26.152
Hey, you two are both
acting very strange,

12:26.304 --> 12:28.062
and I think I know what it is.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.990
He's wearing your underwear,
and you're wearing his.

12:31.142 --> 12:32.158
How do you know that?

12:32.310 --> 12:33.993
Well, you know,
when some people go blind

12:34.145 --> 12:35.645
their other senses
are heightened.

12:35.663 --> 12:38.739
When I lost my legs,
I gained a sense of underpants.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.259
What are you talking about?
We didn't switch underwear.

12:41.410 --> 12:42.910
Are you sure about that?
Stand up

12:43.004 --> 12:44.988
and let Jojo flip your taggies.

12:45.006 --> 12:47.223
Turn around. Butt-to-butt.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.835
We must've accidentally
grabbed the wrong ones

12:58.928 --> 12:59.927
at the laundromat.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.447
Oh, so your boys were

13:02.674 --> 13:03.931
where his boys were.

13:04.025 --> 13:06.493
And your boys were
where his boys were.

13:07.529 --> 13:10.179
BOTH:
Oh, my God!

13:10.198 --> 13:11.772
Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

13:11.866 --> 13:13.792
Peter and Quagmire
exchanged underwear.

13:14.019 --> 13:15.351
Ha! Classic!

13:15.444 --> 13:17.111
Me, I don't wear underwear.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.280
I just wear trunks.

13:19.374 --> 13:20.523
Tree guy.

13:20.616 --> 13:22.191
That'll hit you
when you're driving home.

13:23.194 --> 13:25.220
Hey, look at this table.
What are you guys talking about?

13:33.629 --> 13:35.555
Oh, hey, I-I, uh...

13:35.649 --> 13:37.816
I didn't-- I didn't know
you take out trash, too.

13:37.967 --> 13:40.634
Yeah, I-I, uh...
Only on trash days.

13:40.728 --> 13:42.636
No, right, of course.
Yeah, no, no, I'm sorry. I-I...

13:42.730 --> 13:44.380

13:47.552 --> 13:49.385

yesterday.

13:51.556 --> 13:53.456

I'm gonna have Lois cancel
our dinner plans

14:09.757 --> 14:10.998

14:11.017 --> 14:12.517
I-I think it's too soon.

Hey, you don't think the guys

14:15.171 --> 14:16.579
Oh, I don't think so.

14:16.598 --> 14:18.005
Oh, my God.

14:18.099 --> 14:19.858
I still can't believe they wore
each other's underwear.

14:20.009 --> 14:21.751
Like, can you imagine?

14:21.769 --> 14:22.861
I know, right?

14:23.012 --> 14:24.678
Like, icky times a thousand.

14:24.772 --> 14:26.089
Hey, this is crazy,

14:26.107 --> 14:29.016
but what if we wore
each other's underwear,

14:29.110 --> 14:30.535
-just for a joke?
-What?

14:30.686 --> 14:32.111
No, that's a terrible idea.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.779
Yeah, just-just joking.

14:33.932 --> 14:35.448
So stupid!

Zesty Italian?
Oh, I-I just couldn't.

in my marriage.

15:26.317 --> 15:27.833
Whoops. (chuckles)
I dropped my roll,

15:27.928 --> 15:29.502
which is not at all
an invitation for Peter

15:29.596 --> 15:31.554
to have
an under-the-table conference.

15:40.498 --> 15:42.941
Ha! Darn thing's
always coming off.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.567
Excuse me for one moment,
won't you?

15:47.596 --> 15:49.596
-Why did you do that?
-You dropped all the bread.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.008
-What was I supposed to do?
-Okay, that makes sense.

15:52.101 --> 15:54.935
So, I went to
the underwear doctor and...

15:55.029 --> 15:56.437
you should probably get checked.

15:56.531 --> 15:58.181
They say when you wear
someone's underwear,

15:58.274 --> 15:59.682
you're also wearing
the underwear

15:59.775 --> 16:01.534
of everyone whose underwear
they've worn.

16:01.686 --> 16:02.961
I can't believe this!

16:03.112 --> 16:05.546
I thought I knew you,
Glenn Quagmire!

16:08.284 --> 16:11.452
(chuckles) Here I go again,
filling up on ears.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.862
What's going on here, you two?

16:12.880 --> 16:14.213
You're being very rude.

16:14.365 --> 16:16.957
Lois spent all day overcooking
this meal.

each other's underwear.

Relax, Peter. It's no big deal.

You don't get it!

16:40.166 --> 16:41.907
Oh, quit being so dramatic.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.076
Ladies switch underwear
all the time.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.652
I might be wearing Bonnie's
right now.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.987
I don't even remember.

16:47.081 --> 16:49.823
While that is super sexy
and being stored for later,

16:49.843 --> 16:51.342
it's very different for guys.

16:51.569 --> 16:53.327
That's not true,
male friends can be

16:53.346 --> 16:54.512
more intimate
than they used to.

16:54.663 --> 16:56.497
-BOTH: Nope!
-And the lines
of sexuality are

16:56.516 --> 16:57.849
-more fluid than ever.
-BOTH: Nope!

16:58.000 --> 16:59.666
And people aren't so quick
to judge or label.

16:59.761 --> 17:03.262
-Please stop.
-Masculinity just doesn't
account for stuff like this.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.598
Look,
guys can share laughs and beers,

17:05.750 --> 17:08.675
but we don't share feelings,
emotions, or underwear.

17:08.770 --> 17:11.420
Between male friends, there's
no coming back from this.

17:11.439 --> 17:14.848
He's right. I'm afraid our
relationship is on the skids.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.350
Maybe there's hope
for the future,

17:16.411 --> 17:17.777
but things now are too spotty.

17:17.929 --> 17:19.686

17:19.706 --> 17:21.522
Our reputations are smeared.

maybe I'd push harder.
