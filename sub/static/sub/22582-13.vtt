00:05.204 --> 00:07.240
Chief Engineer's Log, supplemental.

00:07.524 --> 00:10.834
This turned out to be the perfect spot
to test the autopilot upgrades.

00:13.724 --> 00:15.999
The gas giant has dozens of moons...

00:16.844 --> 00:20.280
it's like a gravitational jigsaw puzzle.

00:22.604 --> 00:23.923
Watch out, Travis.

00:24.764 --> 00:26.436
These modifications
are working so well...

00:26.564 --> 00:28.361
pretty soon
we won't need pilots anymore.

00:29.604 --> 00:30.673
Archer to Shuttlepod One.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.643
Captain?

00:33.764 --> 00:36.073
It looks like you're about to have
some company, Trip.

00:36.444 --> 00:38.116
Sensors are picking up...

00:39.084 --> 00:41.757
Say again, Captain.
I'm picking up a lot of interference.

00:42.444 --> 00:45.004
There's a small vessel
approaching your position.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

00:54.644 --> 00:55.997
This is Commander Charles Tucker.

01:09.164 --> 01:13.794
Tucker to Enterprise. Mayday!
I'm losing power. Mayday!

01:14.564 --> 01:18.352
If you can hear me, I'm making
an emergency landing, thrusters only.

01:19.484 --> 01:22.999
I take it back, Travis. I could use
a flesh-and-blood pilot right about now.

01:30.444 --> 01:33.038
It's been a long road

01:34.564 --> 01:36.634
Gettin' from there to here

01:37.524 --> 01:40.357
It's been a long time

01:41.284 --> 01:44.799
But my time is finally near

01:45.164 --> 01:48.679
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:49.404 --> 01:52.282
I will touch the sky

01:52.644 --> 01:56.319
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:56.444 --> 01:59.436
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:59.564 --> 02:03.842
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:03.964 --> 02:07.081
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:07.204 --> 02:11.356
I've got faith to believe

02:11.484 --> 02:14.442
I can do anything

02:14.564 --> 02:18.273
I've got strength of the soul

02:18.844 --> 02:21.836
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:21.964 --> 02:26.196
I can reach any star

02:27.364 --> 02:29.400
I've got faith

02:31.124 --> 02:34.241
I've got faith

02:34.804 --> 02:38.114
Faith of the heart

02:56.124 --> 02:57.603
Enterprise to Shuttlepod One.

02:58.964 --> 03:00.636
Commander Tucker, do you read me?

03:03.684 --> 03:04.639
Malcolm?

03:05.004 --> 03:08.758
I detected weapons fire,
and then both ships just disappeared.

03:09.484 --> 03:10.519
Last known position?

03:11.644 --> 03:14.602
Approximately 50,000 kilometres,
bearing 0-0-3...

03:16.084 --> 03:17.881
mark 2-7, I think.

03:18.484 --> 03:20.952
I can't be more specific.
It's the damned interference.

03:21.404 --> 03:25.079
Many of these moons have atmospheres
that contain selenium isotopes.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.354
That's most likely
what's affecting our sensors.

03:27.804 --> 03:28.919
Trip's a good pilot.

03:29.044 --> 03:31.956
If he was near one of those moons,
he most likely set down on it.

03:33.284 --> 03:35.593
- How many are there?
- Sixty-two.

03:36.724 --> 03:37.998
Then we better start looking.

03:40.084 --> 03:41.722
- Travis.
- Yes, sir.

03:42.484 --> 03:44.873
We'll scan every moon,
even if we have to do it with binoculars.

03:45.964 --> 03:46.919
Keep hailing him.

04:18.603 --> 04:20.959
Chief Engineer's Log, supplemental.

04:21.644 --> 04:22.633
For the record...

04:24.044 --> 04:25.875
I was attacked by a small craft.

04:30.084 --> 04:31.722
I don't know what I did to provoke him.

04:32.804 --> 04:35.364
Something in this moon's atmosphere
neutralized my engines.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.281
I was forced to make
an emergency landing.

04:40.724 --> 04:42.555
It looks like I took some damage
on impact.

04:44.844 --> 04:46.243
Main power's still offline.

04:49.244 --> 04:51.121
I don't think I'll be flying out of here.

04:54.044 --> 04:54.999
First things first.

04:56.244 --> 04:58.280
I'll try and get the transceiver working...

05:03.924 --> 05:05.243
contact the Enterprise.

05:15.844 --> 05:16.833
Damn it.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.634
The son of a bitch stole my transceiver.

06:46.124 --> 06:48.558
- Who are they?
- An Arkonian military vessel.

06:49.244 --> 06:52.281
- You've dealt with them?
- No. But I'm aware of their reputation.

06:52.764 --> 06:55.961
If we're in their territory, we should
proceed with extreme caution.

06:56.804 --> 06:57.793
They're hailing us.

07:03.484 --> 07:05.076
You're on an unauthorized course.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.517
Leave immediately.

07:07.924 --> 07:10.677
- And you are?
- Captain Khata'n Zshaar.

07:11.004 --> 07:14.599
I have orders to destroy any vessel
that violates our territory.

07:15.244 --> 07:17.838
I'm Captain Jonathan Archer
of the Starship Enterprise.

07:19.004 --> 07:21.472
We weren't aware that this system
was claimed by anyone.

07:22.004 --> 07:24.393
Why is there a Vulcan on your Bridge?

07:27.084 --> 07:29.359
Subcommander T'Pol
is my Science Officer.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.117
Turn your ship around.

07:34.924 --> 07:36.994
A member of my crew is missing.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.201
We believe he exchanged weapons fire
with a small vessel.

07:44.124 --> 07:45.523
Was it one of yours?

07:47.164 --> 07:50.236
We sent a patrol ship
to intercept your shuttle.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.117
We have also lost contact.

07:54.324 --> 07:56.792
Then maybe
we can look for them together.

07:58.804 --> 08:02.433
Once we've recovered our crewman,
we'll be more than happy to leave.

08:03.044 --> 08:06.354
If your shuttle
did encounter my patrol ship...

08:07.564 --> 08:09.555
your crewman is already dead.

08:11.684 --> 08:14.881
Either way, we're not going anywhere
until we know what happened.

08:16.084 --> 08:18.996
Now it seems to me
we have a similar problem.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.518
Two missing people and 62 moons.

08:23.724 --> 08:28.081
It'll go a lot faster if we use
both our ships to coordinate the search.

08:30.364 --> 08:33.879
The sooner we get started,
the sooner we'll be out of your territory.

09:38.124 --> 09:39.079
It's him.

09:40.124 --> 09:44.083
I recognise his shuttlecraft.
He seems about as bad off as I am.

09:45.044 --> 09:47.683
Whatever knocked out my engines
probably did the same to his.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.795
If I'd brought
a Universal Translator along...

09:51.924 --> 09:53.073
I'd be able to explain to this guy...

09:53.204 --> 09:55.479
that I'm just trying to get out of here,
like he is.

09:58.244 --> 09:59.438
One piece of good news...

10:00.724 --> 10:02.157
it's starting to warm up a little.

10:03.004 --> 10:04.039
Dawn is coming.

10:28.524 --> 10:29.639
I'm coming out now.

10:30.604 --> 10:32.993
I know you don't understand me.

10:33.764 --> 10:34.753
Please, don't fire.

10:35.924 --> 10:36.959
I want to talk.

10:38.484 --> 10:39.473
I'm unarmed.

10:42.164 --> 10:45.474
We need to talk.
You have something that belongs to me.

10:47.284 --> 10:47.444
I want it back.

10:47.444 --> 10:48.320
I want it back.

10:49.884 --> 10:52.114
If you understand anything
that I'm saying to you...

10:52.244 --> 10:55.361
I want you to listen very, very closely.

10:57.084 --> 10:58.597
Mary had a little lamb.

10:59.884 --> 11:01.556
Its fleece as white as snow.

11:02.804 --> 11:06.683
Everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.392
Now, maybe
we can introduce ourselves.

12:03.324 --> 12:04.359
Nice to meet you, too.

12:05.164 --> 12:08.918
Now I don't want to hurt you.
I just want my transceiver back.

12:39.324 --> 12:41.076
I'm no good until I've had my coffee.

12:49.204 --> 12:51.320
You wouldn't have
a Universal Translator on you?

12:53.444 --> 12:55.435
I don't understand a word you're saying!

13:00.644 --> 13:03.681
I can't make it work. It's broken.

13:04.724 --> 13:06.555
You know, broken.

13:07.404 --> 13:09.395
I was trying to make repairs
when you stole it.

13:13.964 --> 13:14.919
What?

13:21.564 --> 13:23.714
You want me to fix your transceiver?

13:25.684 --> 13:26.878
Is that a yes or a no?

13:28.004 --> 13:29.278
Kush'ka to you, too.

13:36.964 --> 13:39.717
You kill me and I can't fix anything.

13:42.644 --> 13:44.202
You're going to have to untie me.

13:45.684 --> 13:46.833
I need my hands.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.000
I try anything, I'm a dead man.

13:59.764 --> 14:00.799
I get the message.

14:14.964 --> 14:17.524
- Any progress?
- We searched five of the moons.

14:18.964 --> 14:21.114
No sign of Commander Tucker
or the Arkonian ship.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.393
And the Arkonians?

14:24.084 --> 14:25.881
It appears
they've made no progress either.

14:26.204 --> 14:28.513
They're continuing to search the moons
they agreed to.

14:28.964 --> 14:30.238
This is their territory.

14:30.804 --> 14:33.034
They could've called for more ships
to help search.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.563
I'm afraid they don't trust us.

14:35.844 --> 14:38.995
- Primarily because I'm a Vulcan.
- What's the bad blood?

14:39.724 --> 14:42.238
We made First Contact
nearly 100 years ago...

14:42.604 --> 14:44.834
not long after the Arkonians
developed warp drive.

14:45.364 --> 14:47.719
But from the beginning
our relations were difficult.

14:48.004 --> 14:49.756
Your people
accepted Vulcan guidance...

14:50.204 --> 14:52.672
opened diplomatic
and cultural exchanges.

14:53.124 --> 14:55.479
The Arkonians were suspicious
and deceitful.

14:55.964 --> 14:58.319
Eventually, the High Command
withdrew its contingent.

15:01.084 --> 15:02.836
Maybe we'll have better luck with them.

15:03.764 --> 15:04.833
It doesn't appear promising.

15:04.964 --> 15:06.955
- They agreed to work with us.
- For now.

15:08.404 --> 15:10.042
I'd advise you to remain cautious.

15:11.004 --> 15:14.519
Arkonians are unpredictable.
They're prone to hostility.

15:15.284 --> 15:16.399
I'll keep that in mind.

15:17.764 --> 15:19.436
Let me know
when we reach the next moon.

15:39.364 --> 15:40.353
Damn it.

15:43.244 --> 15:44.199
Damn.

15:48.764 --> 15:51.722
Well, looks like we've made
some headway in our First Contact...

15:51.844 --> 15:53.072
between humans and...

15:55.644 --> 15:56.599
whatever you are.

15:57.964 --> 15:59.556
Unfortunately, your first word is...

16:00.364 --> 16:02.673
something you wouldn't want to use
in polite company.

16:07.964 --> 16:08.919
Damn it.

16:10.604 --> 16:11.559
No.

16:12.804 --> 16:13.759
I'm Trip.

16:16.084 --> 16:18.314
- Trip.
- Trip.

16:21.404 --> 16:22.393
Zho'Kaan.

16:24.204 --> 16:27.082
Zho'Kaan. Great.

16:27.884 --> 16:31.001
Now that we've been
properly introduced...

16:33.524 --> 16:34.957
how about some water, Zho'Kaan?

16:35.684 --> 16:37.515
It's getting kind of hot.

16:39.204 --> 16:40.319
Thirsty, you know.

16:41.764 --> 16:43.322
Drink. Water.

16:48.164 --> 16:49.119
Trip.

16:53.164 --> 16:54.119
Thanks.

17:02.684 --> 17:03.673
What the hell is that?

17:19.003 --> 17:19.959
Sorry.

17:27.763 --> 17:30.437
I have water in my shuttle.

17:32.564 --> 17:35.761
Water. Something I can drink.

17:42.444 --> 17:43.399
Trip.

18:20.004 --> 18:21.562
There's a med kit in my shuttlepod.

18:24.164 --> 18:26.041
What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?

18:38.204 --> 18:39.239
That was quite a trick.

18:52.324 --> 18:53.439
All right, all right.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.802
I can't fix this thing. It's a lost cause.

19:02.604 --> 19:04.674
Maybe if you vomit on it, it'll fix itself.

19:07.644 --> 19:10.078
Come over here. I want you to see this.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.439
Here.

19:16.044 --> 19:17.033
Come here.

19:20.764 --> 19:22.038
It's like talking to Porthos.

19:23.084 --> 19:24.039
See this?

19:24.804 --> 19:28.353
I tried bypassing the induction coil,
but it didn't work.

19:29.764 --> 19:32.278
See? In here.

19:39.004 --> 19:42.280
I can't fix this.
I need to get back to my ship.

19:43.724 --> 19:44.679
My ship.

19:46.684 --> 19:47.639
Now pick them up.

19:58.444 --> 19:59.513
Yeah, same to you.

20:00.484 --> 20:01.439
Now let's get going.

20:08.884 --> 20:11.079
- What have you got?
- See for yourself.

20:15.084 --> 20:16.278
I'll need a little help here.

20:16.724 --> 20:18.555
It's a thermo-kinetic
analysis of the moons.

20:18.924 --> 20:22.121
Each undergoes extreme temperature
variations during their orbits.

20:23.644 --> 20:24.599
Go on.

20:24.844 --> 20:27.995
At night, it can drop to five
or even 10 degrees below zero.

20:28.364 --> 20:29.433
That doesn't sound so bad.

20:29.564 --> 20:33.637
During the day, the temperature can
rise to as high as 170 degrees.

20:37.564 --> 20:39.441
We better hope
Trip landed on the night side.

20:39.564 --> 20:41.316
And that we find him
before the sun rises.

20:49.444 --> 20:51.912
Don't give me that look.
You started this.

21:18.404 --> 21:19.393
You want some food?

21:29.524 --> 21:30.479
Food.

21:48.964 --> 21:49.953
I couldn't agree more.

22:00.924 --> 22:03.996
You want food from your ship?

22:06.364 --> 22:09.401
V'dhoze, that means food?

22:18.324 --> 22:20.884
- Ship.
- Ship.

22:23.484 --> 22:24.473
Yeah.

22:25.924 --> 22:29.280
Sorry, but breakfast
is going to have to wait.

22:32.324 --> 22:35.361
I've figured out a way
to get us out of here.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.993
I got a pretty good look
at your com configuration back there.

22:43.604 --> 22:44.639
I think...

22:44.884 --> 22:49.275
I can cannibalise the power supply
from your transceiver...

22:51.644 --> 22:53.396
and use it to get mine working.

22:54.924 --> 22:56.198
Maybe get a message off.

23:06.044 --> 23:06.999
Got it.

23:08.644 --> 23:09.599
Almost there.

23:14.164 --> 23:15.392
I think this is going to work.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.873
No, not nohkto.

23:21.724 --> 23:23.954
- Good.
- Good.

23:25.004 --> 23:25.959
That's right.

23:26.684 --> 23:27.753
We're getting out of here.

23:28.844 --> 23:31.916
Once we get back to Enterprise,
and we can understand each other...

23:32.604 --> 23:34.993
the first words out of your mouth
better be thank you.

23:39.764 --> 23:40.833
You think that's funny?

23:50.804 --> 23:51.839
You going to laugh now?

23:53.764 --> 23:54.958
Tucker to Enterprise.

23:57.124 --> 23:58.239
Enterprise, do you read me?

24:00.084 --> 24:01.073
Come on, Hoshi.

24:03.444 --> 24:04.593
Tucker to Enterprise.

24:08.244 --> 24:10.712
This terrain, it's all volcanic.

24:11.404 --> 24:14.123
Igneous rock is heavy in
diamagnetic minerals.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.882
It's interfering with the transmission.

24:19.444 --> 24:20.877
I think I know what we need to do.

24:22.084 --> 24:23.119
The transceiver...

24:24.524 --> 24:26.913
the tsunsana.

24:29.044 --> 24:32.195
It's bad down here. Nohkto.

24:33.084 --> 24:34.836
But if we take it to higher ground...

24:35.684 --> 24:37.720
we could avoid
some of the interference.

24:41.644 --> 24:42.793
I'm going to need help.

24:46.284 --> 24:49.196
You and me together.

24:59.284 --> 25:00.239
See?

25:07.324 --> 25:08.473
I'm not going to hurt you.

25:10.804 --> 25:14.353
And you are not going to hurt me.

25:18.404 --> 25:19.473
We'll work together.

25:42.724 --> 25:43.679
Before we start...

25:45.804 --> 25:47.362
we'll get some food from your ship...

25:49.084 --> 25:50.039
your v'dhoze.

26:19.044 --> 26:19.999
Easy.

27:42.364 --> 27:43.479
Is that the best you can do?

28:14.204 --> 28:15.762
We can fight some more if you want...

28:17.924 --> 28:19.721
or we can try to get the hell out of here.

28:23.724 --> 28:24.713
What's it going to be?

28:35.564 --> 28:36.519
Come on.

28:52.204 --> 28:53.796
Captain, I'm picking up a transmission.

28:54.564 --> 28:57.124
- Trip?
- I can't tell yet. I'm trying to get a lock.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.796
Chief Engineer's Log, supplemental.

29:07.284 --> 29:09.923
It's been two hours
since we started signalling Enterprise.

29:10.484 --> 29:11.599
No response yet.

29:12.404 --> 29:16.192
The sun's not even up yet,
and it's already hotter than hell.

29:20.084 --> 29:22.040
My sparring partner
doesn't look too good.

29:23.724 --> 29:25.043
I can't be sure, but...

29:26.284 --> 29:28.081
I don't think his species can sweat.

29:30.764 --> 29:34.473
For the record,
I have learned one thing about him.

29:35.924 --> 29:37.152
His name's Zho'Kaan.

29:40.284 --> 29:42.275
Anything you want to say
to the folks back home?

29:48.364 --> 29:49.399
That means bad.

29:52.084 --> 29:53.403
You'd be proud of me, Hoshi.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.394
I picked up about a dozen words
in his language.

30:00.404 --> 30:02.599
A couple of them
are real tongue twisters.

30:45.804 --> 30:46.759
Hey...

30:49.364 --> 30:50.353
Zho'Kaan.

30:57.884 --> 30:58.953
Thought I lost you there.

31:08.484 --> 31:11.794
No. No Enterprise.

31:15.684 --> 31:16.639
Damn it.

31:33.844 --> 31:34.833
Don't worry.

31:35.524 --> 31:37.594
I'll get Phlox to cook up
a new batch for you...

31:37.724 --> 31:38.918
once we're aboard Enterprise.

31:39.364 --> 31:40.797
He's great with that kind of thing.

31:46.044 --> 31:47.363
Stay with me, Zho'Kaan.

31:50.404 --> 31:53.043
Don't die on me now. Understand?

31:58.844 --> 31:59.833
All right.

32:12.324 --> 32:13.279
Enterprise.

32:14.684 --> 32:16.322
See? I told you.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.315
Hoshi, is that you?

32:21.684 --> 32:23.402
- Do you read me?
- We read you, Trip.

32:23.524 --> 32:26.960
You're just in time, Captain.
It's starting to get a little hot down here.

32:27.084 --> 32:28.881
We're getting a lock
on your position now.

32:29.004 --> 32:30.232
Don't send a shuttlepod.

32:31.164 --> 32:33.519
Something in this atmosphere
affects the engines.

32:33.964 --> 32:38.162
It's selenium isotopes, but we don't
think it'll interfere with the transporter.

32:38.924 --> 32:41.154
- I'm not alone, Captain.
- We know.

32:41.484 --> 32:43.042
The Arkonians helped us find you.

32:43.364 --> 32:45.082
How are you and their pilot
getting along?

32:46.924 --> 32:48.198
Just like old friends.

32:49.364 --> 32:50.513
I'm a little worried, though.

32:52.524 --> 32:53.877
He's gotten very dehydrated.

32:54.204 --> 32:55.319
Stand by, Trip.

32:55.604 --> 32:56.753
Prepare the transporter.

32:57.284 --> 32:58.922
I wouldn't do that, Captain.

32:59.884 --> 33:00.873
What's the problem?

33:01.004 --> 33:03.564
I've been analysing
the Arkonian's physiology.

33:03.764 --> 33:07.120
Their endocrine system's extremely
sensitive to temperature fluctuations.

33:07.564 --> 33:09.555
If that pilot
is suffering from dehydration...

33:09.764 --> 33:12.119
it's no doubt
causing an acute cellular breakdown.

33:12.564 --> 33:13.519
Meaning?

33:14.124 --> 33:16.558
Transporting him
will most likely be fatal.

33:20.004 --> 33:23.314
- Archer to Commander Tucker.
- I'm still here, Captain.

33:23.884 --> 33:27.843
Trip, we can bring you aboard
but we can't transport the Arkonian.

33:28.324 --> 33:29.837
Dr. Phlox says it will kill him.

33:30.324 --> 33:32.155
We'll find a way
to get him back to his ship.

33:32.764 --> 33:35.676
But in the meantime,
I'm getting you out of there.

33:36.244 --> 33:38.474
No way, Captain.
I'm not leaving him here.

33:38.804 --> 33:41.113
The surface temperature
is rising quickly, Commander.

33:41.524 --> 33:44.641
I estimate it will reach 130 degrees
within the next hour.

33:45.004 --> 33:47.837
Let's get you home.
Then we'll worry about your friend.

33:48.404 --> 33:49.883
I'm sorry, sir, but I can't do that.

33:50.764 --> 33:52.038
Maybe there's another way.

33:53.804 --> 33:55.396
We know our pods can't make it.

33:57.444 --> 34:00.516
But I got a good look at the circuitry
inside the Arkonian shuttle.

34:02.404 --> 34:04.793
- One of theirs could be modified.
- How?

34:05.084 --> 34:07.393
If they take a look at their
intake manifolds...

34:08.083 --> 34:11.793
I think they could realign them
to filter out the isotopes.

34:12.724 --> 34:13.679
We'll talk to them...

34:15.204 --> 34:17.239
but I won't let you stay down there
much longer.

34:19.204 --> 34:20.159
Understood.

34:20.563 --> 34:21.553
Archer out.

34:32.764 --> 34:33.913
Tucker to Enterprise.

34:37.524 --> 34:39.833
Enterprise, respond.

34:43.684 --> 34:45.197
Some of these relays have fused.

34:49.404 --> 34:50.393
Must be the heat.

34:54.764 --> 34:55.719
Hey.

35:17.844 --> 35:22.122
I don't suppose the Captain'll trust me
to go out on my own for a while.

35:24.444 --> 35:26.958
I wouldn't be surprised
if he knocked me down to steward.

35:29.604 --> 35:30.832
Your orange juice, sir.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.722
Jam or marmalade, sir?

35:35.044 --> 35:36.079
But I tell you...

35:36.884 --> 35:38.795
I wouldn't trade my time on Enterprise...

35:40.804 --> 35:41.873
not for anything.

35:45.164 --> 35:47.837
I've seen things
I couldn't even imagine back home.

35:49.244 --> 35:52.281
I saw the Great Plume of Agosoria...

35:54.044 --> 35:57.923
and I saw the
three moons on Matalas Prime.

36:09.084 --> 36:12.042
And I stood on an asteroid crater...

36:14.444 --> 36:15.843
twice as high as Everest.

36:17.004 --> 36:19.154
Went diving in the ice caves
of Etheenia...

36:20.244 --> 36:22.838
rode in a Suliban Cell Ship...

36:24.924 --> 36:25.959
spent the night...

36:27.564 --> 36:29.156
I spent the night with a princess.

36:32.324 --> 36:35.714
And I even got pregnant once.

36:38.204 --> 36:39.557
Now there's a story.

36:42.964 --> 36:44.397
I'm sure you have stories, too.

36:45.364 --> 36:47.036
That's why we chose this life, right?

36:48.244 --> 36:49.996
See things we've never seen before.

36:52.324 --> 36:53.518
Hell of a ride, though.

36:57.964 --> 36:59.079
Hell of a ride.

37:08.684 --> 37:09.673
Zho'Kaan.

37:33.124 --> 37:34.079
Come in.

37:39.404 --> 37:43.283
I just got a report from my doctor.
Your pilot's responding well.

37:44.564 --> 37:46.361
He'll be ready to go home
in a few hours.

37:47.444 --> 37:48.672
And your crewman?

37:49.604 --> 37:52.596
He's tired and a bit sunburned,
but he's doing fine.

37:54.844 --> 37:59.281
If I discover that my pilot fired on
your shuttle without provocation...

38:00.444 --> 38:01.593
he'll be disciplined.

38:03.244 --> 38:04.518
It was a misunderstanding.

38:06.444 --> 38:08.753
I hope we can avoid them in the future.

38:09.924 --> 38:13.599
I expect you to leave this system
immediately as agreed.

38:26.204 --> 38:29.116
I guess we won't be adding
the Arkonians to our list of friends.

38:29.884 --> 38:32.239
The encounter was less volatile
than I expected.

38:35.484 --> 38:38.362
You managed to establish
better relations in a single day...

38:38.964 --> 38:40.716
than the Vulcans have in a century.

38:44.564 --> 38:45.713
Let's hope it stays that way.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.119
How's he doing?

38:54.844 --> 38:58.041
Why don't you ask him yourself?
The universal translator's online.

39:02.564 --> 39:06.318
They told me
another 10 minutes of sunshine...

39:08.004 --> 39:09.073
and we'd have been cooked.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.876
I thought you said the UT was working.

39:15.924 --> 39:20.281
I believe
you promised me some Tarrattaash.

39:21.244 --> 39:23.474
You mean the brown stuff
you were drinking.

39:24.884 --> 39:25.839
Won't take a minute.

39:27.164 --> 39:28.313
Anything else while I'm at it?

39:29.244 --> 39:32.953
Our chef is making something
called Chicken Marsala tonight.

39:38.844 --> 39:39.833
Got you.

39:41.324 --> 39:42.313
Trip...

39:43.924 --> 39:45.403
when I fired at your vessel...

39:50.724 --> 39:52.442
I'm grateful I didn't destroy it.

39:56.044 --> 39:57.238
That makes two of us.
