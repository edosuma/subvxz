WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.466
[opening theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.928
[man] Hey!

01:06.566 --> 01:09.360
-[Trøgs] Welcome, friends.
-[both screaming]

01:11.196 --> 01:12.238
Ah, they're still here.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.865
[both screaming]

01:13.948 --> 01:15.909
[music box creaking and winding]

01:15.992 --> 01:17.702
[creepy melody playing]

01:27.003 --> 01:28.588
What, no hug?

01:31.382 --> 01:32.926
I'm waiting.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.553
Come on, Bean.
Who can resist a creepy mom hug?

01:35.637 --> 01:36.805
[both] Shut up, Luci.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.932
Oh, Bean! I've missed you!

01:39.015 --> 01:41.017
Well, I'm not gonna miss you, Mom.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.019
[grunting]

01:43.102 --> 01:45.897
[whispering] Is this the mother
you're always talking about?

01:45.980 --> 01:50.485
She's not an ugly, evil bitch.
But she is sluttier than I imagined.

01:50.568 --> 01:54.489
Oh. Hello, Elfo. Last time I saw you,
you were a lot more dead.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.532
[rumbling]

01:55.615 --> 01:57.367
We can't have that moonhole.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.953
[Trøgs] Moon.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.871
-Moon.
-Silence!

02:01.955 --> 02:03.998
Seal team six, seal the hole!

02:04.082 --> 02:05.041
[all grunt]

02:05.125 --> 02:06.918
[blows horn]

02:07.001 --> 02:09.295
[rhythmic grunting]

02:12.173 --> 02:13.258
Too slow.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.551
[all grunting]

02:14.634 --> 02:18.138
What are you doing here, Mom?
Why can't you just leave me alone?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.932
Is your life so awful
you have to keep wrecking mine?

02:21.015 --> 02:22.183
I just saved you, dear.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.394
Now, would you like me
to answer those other questions

02:24.477 --> 02:26.479
or did you just need
to get it out of your system?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.815
You know what? Forget it.
I just want to get out of here.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.692
Darling, nothing's keeping you.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.111
Yeah,
nothing except your freaky little molemen.

02:33.194 --> 02:37.365
We're not freaky little molemen.
We're beautiful, bug-eyed Trøgs.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.076
Trøgs, the "o" has a slash through it.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.412
Those are molemen.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.371
How ya doin'?

02:43.454 --> 02:44.873
'Sup, tater dude?

02:44.956 --> 02:48.334
Let her go.
You're free to leave anytime you want.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.295
I want now. Uh, let's do now.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.341
Ow!

02:56.926 --> 02:59.804
[Dagmar] Remember, darling,
if you show your face in Dreamland…

02:59.888 --> 03:01.097
[echoing]

03:01.180 --> 03:02.599
…they'll kill you.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.017
[echoing]

03:06.686 --> 03:07.979
[chuckles]

03:09.397 --> 03:12.317
[Dagmar] And you'll never find
your way out without my help. [echoing]

03:12.942 --> 03:14.736
Sorry about the echo. [echoing]

03:15.862 --> 03:17.113
I know it's creepy.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.537
[Trøgs] Welcome back, friends.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.457
-[Luci grunts]
-That's for calling me "tater dude."

03:35.924 --> 03:39.052
Who's gonna be accused
of being a witch next, Daddy?

03:39.135 --> 03:42.263
I'm thinking the lady next door
who has that little chihuahua.

03:42.347 --> 03:46.851
-The one that never stops barking?
-That's the one, son. That's the one.

03:46.935 --> 03:51.564
An excellent spectacle, Your Majesty.
You were a model of regal barbarism.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.317
Two scoops of melted ice cream
for you tonight.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.487
I can't believe I killed my big sister.

03:57.570 --> 04:01.324
Yeesh, I haven't seen him this upset
since we burned his birthday clown.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.993
[sighs] Being king is hard.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.080
-I need some advice.
-We're your advisors.

04:07.163 --> 04:11.417
-No, I want to talk to my father.
-I wouldn't advise that.

04:14.212 --> 04:18.174
Hey, what's Derek doin'
down there with Odval, huh?

04:18.258 --> 04:23.054
And the Archdruidess?
And my crown? Something's goin' on.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.349
Like any two numbers, this don't add up.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.810
[groans] My wound.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.728
[Archdruidess chuckles]

04:30.812 --> 04:32.855
Settle an argument, Pendergast.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.149
I say we murder Zøg now,

04:35.233 --> 04:37.819
but Odval here thinks
he's about to die on his own.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.238
You're a bloodthirsty bastard.
What do you say?

04:40.321 --> 04:42.824
I'm no decision-maker,
I'm an action-taker.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.201
And a pudding-maker.
I make wonderful pudding.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.829
[Odval] Shush. Let's see how he's doing.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.080
[Zøg gasps and grunts]

04:49.747 --> 04:51.874
[breathing heavily]

04:56.546 --> 04:59.424
[groaning] I'm dyin' over here.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.428
Ugh! The royal blob's still alive.

05:03.511 --> 05:07.473
Oh, I wanted to gloat
directly over our victim's corpse.

05:07.557 --> 05:11.477
-There's nothing more satisfying.
-Or arousing.

05:11.561 --> 05:16.274
No worries. From the sound of it,
he'll soon be as dead as his daughter.

05:16.357 --> 05:20.570
-[groaning] What? You…
-[Odval] See? There's his death-mutter.

05:20.653 --> 05:25.283
[groaning] You'll rue the day
you messed with my daughter…

05:25.366 --> 05:28.745
I don't have time for muttering.
Hand me a murder stick.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.875
Now, now. We mustn't risk
our immortal souls by killing him.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.585
Souls? [scoffs]

05:35.668 --> 05:38.588
-But you're the leader of the church.
-Church, shmurch.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.922
[Zøg groaning]

05:40.006 --> 05:42.175
For a dying man,
he's making a lot of noise.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.760
I wonder if he's recovering.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.430
Oh, dear. The people mustn't see that
or they'll restore him to the throne.

05:47.513 --> 05:51.142
Pendergast, stay here and make sure
Zøg never leaves this room.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.227
-Can I order in?
-You'll have to.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.979
And if he tries to leave,

05:55.063 --> 05:57.023
-hack him into little pieces.
-[grunts]

06:03.988 --> 06:06.282
[Dagmar] Ladies and whatevers,

06:06.365 --> 06:10.161
thank you all for attending
this mandatory midnight supper.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.622
I can hear someone eating. Yeah.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.583
No, you. Just put the spork down.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.751
-[metal clangs]
-Thank you.

06:16.834 --> 06:20.505
Let's give a big Trøgtown welcome
to our-- I can still hear it!

06:22.256 --> 06:25.426
Let's give a big Trøgtown welcome
to our guest of honor,

06:25.510 --> 06:28.930
my beautiful daughter, Princess Tiabeanie!

06:30.598 --> 06:31.682
[clears throat]

06:31.766 --> 06:34.102
-And…
-And two little nobodies.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.103
[clapping stops]

06:36.187 --> 06:40.024
And now that we are
finally reunited as queen and princess,

06:40.108 --> 06:43.861
the last of the prophets
and the fulfillment of the prophecy,

06:43.945 --> 06:48.658
my greatest desire
is to put that all aside.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.826
[Trøg] What?

06:49.909 --> 06:54.539
And focus on what's most important,
the reunion of mother and child.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.250
Bean, I've missed you so much.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.459
[Trøgs] Aw…

06:58.543 --> 06:59.877
[Trøgs clapping]

06:59.961 --> 07:03.047
-I know we've had our differences.
-We tried to kill each other.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.551
But now is the time to put the future
aside and make up for the past.

07:06.634 --> 07:11.097
I rescued you for a reason. And it has
everything to do with what's in here.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.682
Her thorax.

07:12.765 --> 07:17.395
We have time now.
World domination can wait. Here's to love!

07:17.937 --> 07:18.938
[Trøgs slurp]

07:19.730 --> 07:22.442
Wow, Mom,
I don't know if you mean any of that,

07:22.525 --> 07:26.154
but I'll toast to you not trying
to screw that crown on my head.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.572
-Oh, that old thing.
-[clangs]

07:28.656 --> 07:29.699
[Dagmar slurps]

07:30.366 --> 07:34.370
[grunts] Nothing like being burned
at the stake to work up an appetite.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.498
-[yelps]
-No, no, no. Here, in Trøgtown,

07:37.582 --> 07:39.375
your kind gets table scraps.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.587
You realize I'm not a talking cat, right?
I'm a talking demon.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.007
Oh, we know.
We live one floor up from Hell.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.844
You guys are terrible neighbors
and you cook all that smelly cabbage.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.220
Those are children!

07:56.350 --> 07:57.727
Mind if I squeeze in?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.270
Oh, sorry, there's not a ton of…

07:59.353 --> 08:00.354
-[grunts]
-Oh, okay.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.816
[chuckles] Ooh, look at you.
You're not like the other guys.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.944
Your giant head-holes are relatively tiny.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.447
Finally. Someone gets it. [chuckles]

08:09.530 --> 08:13.034
Yeah, um, that's kinda
what I was going for.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.535
[both chuckle]

08:15.286 --> 08:17.205
Hi, I'm Trixy.

08:17.288 --> 08:21.501
Hi, there, Trixy. The name's O. Elf-o.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.544
[both laughing]

08:23.628 --> 08:26.464
[clears throat] I've never gotten
such attention from women.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.090
I don't know how to handle it.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.051
Oh, wow.

08:30.134 --> 08:34.347
-What is all this stuff?
-Anchovies with vinegar and mustard.

08:34.430 --> 08:39.769
[gasps] Salty, sour and slimy?
It's like the holy trinity of savory!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.896
Mmm! [chomping]

08:43.523 --> 08:48.694
-Um, don't you guys eat?
-Oh, we have our own special diet.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.656
Cave juice.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.408
-[Elfo] Cave juice?
-[seductively] Mmm.

08:54.992 --> 08:59.372
Got it. Okay. Glad we cleared that up.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.373
[both chuckle]

09:00.456 --> 09:01.374
Freak.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.044
[slurps and chomps]

09:06.754 --> 09:07.880
Freak.

09:12.843 --> 09:18.015
Sire? I don't know if you can hear me,
and there's a ton of blood in your ears,

09:18.099 --> 09:21.352
but, uh, I just wanted to say,
I never knew my father

09:21.435 --> 09:23.312
because he died serving your father

09:23.396 --> 09:25.982
in that battle over the canal
we don't use anymore.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.984
But I always had you to look up to.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.988
And when you pushed me into battle,
I went. Not because you're my king,

09:32.071 --> 09:35.074
but because I knew you'd be right there
fighting behind me.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.661
Remember when we had
a victory dinner after that battle,

09:38.744 --> 09:42.623
and you went into a drunken rage
and you gouged my eyeball out?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.334
Fun fact, people thought
it was a fork you threw,

09:45.418 --> 09:50.381
but it was actually a spoon that you
threw so hard, at such a velocity,

09:50.464 --> 09:51.757
that it just… [whooshes]

09:51.841 --> 09:54.093
…melon scooped my eye right outta there.

09:54.176 --> 09:59.473
Down to the bone, sir.
Impressive. You are a true warrior.

09:59.557 --> 10:04.270
And no matter what people say, sire,
I know you're a good man.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.818
-What happened to your appetite?
-I'm allergic to pandering.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.445
I remember you used to eat

10:12.528 --> 10:15.114
everything in sight
with those teeth. [chuckles]

10:15.197 --> 10:17.116
Like a manic little beaver-girl!

10:17.199 --> 10:18.326
[gnaws]

10:18.409 --> 10:21.662
I get it, you have perfect teeth.
Why are you doing this?

10:21.746 --> 10:24.832
To make you happy. Trust me,
I'm not playing mind games with you.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.043
This from the woman
who invaded your dreams?

10:27.126 --> 10:29.378
Luci, sweetness,
you haven't finished your rat bones.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.463
Ow!

10:30.546 --> 10:33.132
You've had a long day at the stake.
Shall we retire?

10:33.215 --> 10:34.800
-It's getting dark.
-How can you tell?

10:34.884 --> 10:38.387
Well, Trøgs are creatures of habit.
They know when it's time to sleep.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.307
And when it's time
to do the goddamn dishes!

10:41.390 --> 10:42.516
[Trøgs groaning]

10:42.600 --> 10:45.102
Just promise you'll think about
giving me another chance.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.272
I need to go to bed now.
Which rock do I sleep on?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.859
And no invading my dreams this time.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.403
[chuckles] Of course not.
I know you like to be alone

10:54.487 --> 10:56.280
with your underwater sex fantasies.

10:56.364 --> 11:00.785
How dare you? Also, I have no idea
what you're even talking about.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.829
Good night, dear.
Yugo will get you ready for bed.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.248
-This way to the cave inn.
-[gasps]

11:06.332 --> 11:09.919
-That sounds dangerous.
-No, "inn" as in "hotel."

11:10.002 --> 11:13.047
-Oh, so it's safe?
-No, there's a lot of cave-ins.

11:14.298 --> 11:17.385
[Elfo] Bean, how can you
be sleepy at a time like this?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.261
-I'm not. I'm angry.
-[Elfo] Hmm.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.515
Sometimes, when I'm angry,
I get tired, too.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.308
You know what?
You're making me tired.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.602
Go walk with Yugo.
I gotta figure this out.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.896
-Aw.
-If there's one thing I've learned,

11:28.979 --> 11:31.732
it's that when you're stuck
in a cave with your psycho mom,

11:31.816 --> 11:33.776
the best thing to do is play along.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.153
I've gotta go undercover
as her loving daughter.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.198
Just be careful.
Don't let her mess with your head.

11:42.576 --> 11:46.705
Oh, my gosh! It's exactly
like my bedroom from when I was little.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.168
What are these frilly dresses doing
in my liquor cabinet?

11:51.252 --> 11:53.879
You two, this way to the sleep chambers.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.215
-Hold hands.
-[Luci grunts]

11:56.298 --> 11:57.299
[Elfo] Good night, Bean.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.807
[Luci] Oh, we have these in Hell.
They're called crypts.

12:04.890 --> 12:09.937
Man, these Trøgs are spooky, but this
cold, hard sleep nook seems cozy enough.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.941
-Hi, Elfo.
-Hi, Trixy. I mean, what the hell?

12:14.442 --> 12:15.734
-[Trixy moans]
-Oh.

12:15.818 --> 12:16.819
Oh, whoa.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.779
[Trixy moans and grunts]

12:20.197 --> 12:22.408
-[Elfo whispering] Shut up, Trixy.
-[Luci] Shut up, Elfo!

12:22.491 --> 12:23.701
Shut up, Elfo!

12:23.784 --> 12:25.870
[Trøgs] Shut up, Elfo!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.539
-[groaning]
-[door opens]

12:41.802 --> 12:43.471
[suspenseful music playing]

13:08.412 --> 13:09.413
[grunts]

13:14.502 --> 13:16.295
[footsteps squeaking]

13:16.378 --> 13:17.379
[cushion whooshes]

13:17.463 --> 13:19.340
[Derek] All right, butts down.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.051
[throne creaking]

13:23.302 --> 13:26.138
And now to achieve our ultimate goal,

13:26.222 --> 13:30.559
making Dreamland into a rigid theocracy
with a rich, full, spiritual life.

13:30.643 --> 13:36.065
Mmm, with an emphasis on rich, baby.
Hallelujah, amen and ka-ching!

13:36.148 --> 13:40.653
Here are the edicts, Your Majesty.
Remember to use your outside voice.

13:40.736 --> 13:41.654
Right-eo.

13:42.279 --> 13:47.243
[clears throat] "By order of the King,
me, Derek, I,

13:47.326 --> 13:51.121
we do declare Dreamland
is now a theocracy!"

13:51.205 --> 13:56.961
"All power emanates from this Holy Throne
and the ass therein ensconced!"

13:57.044 --> 14:01.590
"Henceforth, there shall be
no more immorality of any kind!"

14:01.674 --> 14:02.925
"No more alcohol!"

14:05.219 --> 14:07.179
[gasps and burps]

14:07.263 --> 14:09.223
[Derek] "No more gambling!"

14:09.306 --> 14:11.642
[chuckles] Huh?

14:12.726 --> 14:15.521
[Derek] "No more unlicensed vending!"

14:16.272 --> 14:18.440
[man 1] Oh, no! My precious fluids!

14:18.524 --> 14:21.110
[Derek] "No unlawful cohabitation!"

14:21.860 --> 14:22.861
[man 2] Ow!

14:22.945 --> 14:26.031
[Derek] "And, most importantly,
no more comedy!"

14:26.115 --> 14:29.618
-So my act is still okay?
-You know what I think's funny?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.287
-What?
-Your catchphrase.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.206
[chuckles] What catchphrase?
Oh, no… [whimpering]

14:34.290 --> 14:35.541
[chuckling] Yeah, that's it.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.168
[Bean] I thought you were taking us
to the coffee shop.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.296
[Trixy] Dagmar said to show you
the scenic route.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.716
Behold the glorious beauty
of mining pit number three.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.010
Trøgs have been excavating
for generations.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.429
We'll keep it up
until the whole world is hollow.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.599
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask the happy miners.

14:51.682 --> 14:55.686
-[whistles] Comin' through!
-Where do you put the rocks you excavate?

14:55.769 --> 14:58.898
We have another cave
we excavated for rock storage.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.775
Where did you put
the rock you excavated from that cave?

15:01.859 --> 15:05.654
What are you, the rock police?
I put 'em up my ass. How's that?

15:09.867 --> 15:11.076
[Elfo] Oh, wow!

15:11.160 --> 15:12.995
Another cave!

15:14.121 --> 15:18.167
-This is your garbage hole?
-No, this is our treasury cave.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.544
Trøgs like to go
to the surface and forage.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.629
You mean steal?

15:21.712 --> 15:24.214
Eh, potato, potahto. We forage 'em both.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.009
If Trøgs have been to the surface,
how come we've never seen you?

15:27.092 --> 15:30.930
Well, we got tunnels everywhere.
Including the walls of your castle.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.474
Huh. So that's what happened to Voop.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.477
[Trixy] He's stuffed with dried corn.
That's what makes him posable.

15:38.687 --> 15:42.191
And coming up next
is our underground Fungus Forest.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.027
[Elfo] Uh, what's the deal
with those freaky mushrooms?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.612
[Trixy] They're called Trøg logs.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.823
We use them for structural reinforcement,
building insulation,

15:49.907 --> 15:52.534
and to make those tiny umbrellas
you put in fancy drinks.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.458
[sniffs] Well, they smell amazing.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.293
Oh, yeah. I should've reminded you.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.213
Hold your breath.
You don't wanna be breathing in spores.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.967
I should've been holding my breath!
[laughs] Spores make you so forgetful.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.554
Oh, no. Not again.

16:15.891 --> 16:16.892
[distorted] Whoa.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.145
I can see colors and hear sounds!

16:20.229 --> 16:23.065
[chuckles] Are you freakin' out, man?

16:23.691 --> 16:24.942
I don't feel anything.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.697
[Elfo and Luci chuckling] Ooh, whoa.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.908
[Bean] There's that
little drug door again.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.996
[all yelling and laughing]

16:42.543 --> 16:44.253
[all laughing]

16:54.138 --> 16:55.806
[Bean and Luci yell]

16:58.142 --> 17:00.144
[psychedelic music playing]

17:07.317 --> 17:11.655
Welcome, stoners. We worship the Moon.
They say when it's at its highest--

17:11.739 --> 17:12.573
Like us!

17:12.656 --> 17:17.911
Yes, my son. When it's at its highest,
we Trøgs gain our special powers.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.456
Cool. Where's the Moon now?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.082
Beats me. We're in a cave.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.878
[Trixy] And this
is the Pool of Reflection,

17:25.961 --> 17:28.630
one of the holiest sites
in all of Trøgentology.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.800
We come here when we're struggling
with negative thoughts.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.679
You say your wish into the spirit rock
and then you throw it.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.682
I wish you the best
with that mole skank, Craig!

17:38.766 --> 17:40.434
-[grunts]
-[Craig] Ow!

17:40.517 --> 17:42.603
You said your name was Trevor! [grunts]

17:43.520 --> 17:46.065
Weird. I feel like I've been here before.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.941
-You have, dear.
-[yelping]

17:48.025 --> 17:49.359
Don't do that.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.154
Trixy, I have something special
I want to show Bean.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.573
Why don't you take Elfo
to the Lover's Gravel Pit?

17:54.656 --> 17:57.201
-Okay!
-Luci, you can chaperone.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.161
Who's up for some Trøggy style?

17:59.244 --> 18:00.704
[scatting]

18:02.247 --> 18:04.166
[Dagmar] I used to bring you down here
when you were little.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.835
Really? Seems kind of dangerous
for a toddler.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.046
You used to love to stare into the pond.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.340
You thought the reflection
was a little water girl.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.341
I believed that?

18:12.424 --> 18:15.344
That's what I told you.
Oh, look. There she is now.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.100
Look, Bean,
I know things are awful between us.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.269
I don't know where it all went wrong,
but from the moment you were born,

18:24.353 --> 18:27.648
you were my greatest gift.
You realize, you're all I have.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.274
Oh, Mom, you're all I have.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.653
I know you're lying,
but I hope one day you'll mean that.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.530
Why don't you make a wish, darling?

18:41.662 --> 18:43.956
-Ow!
-Sorry, Craig!

18:44.039 --> 18:45.707
[crows cawing]

18:53.215 --> 18:54.383
[grunts]

18:54.466 --> 18:56.552
Gah! I kneel before thee, my ghost king!

18:56.635 --> 19:01.014
I ain't no ghost, Pendergast.
I ain't even dyin' no more.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.642
I've been fakin' it
so you wouldn't kill me off,

19:03.725 --> 19:06.478
but now, honestly, I don't care.

19:06.562 --> 19:10.816
My kingdom's outta control, my closest
allies are now my mortal enemies,

19:10.899 --> 19:12.568
you're now my closest ally…

19:12.651 --> 19:14.027
I'm flattered, sire.

19:14.111 --> 19:18.699
[groaning] And worst of all,
my wonderful, crazy daughter is dead.

19:18.782 --> 19:22.619
I gave her a hard time,
but she was the light of my life. Beanie!

19:22.703 --> 19:24.788
I got no reason to live.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.083
Here's a halberd. Kill me for real, huh?

19:28.167 --> 19:31.420
On the count of three,
just splatter me good.

19:31.503 --> 19:35.174
I know it's hard to see,
but try to hit my neck.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.384
[indistinct chatter]

19:40.179 --> 19:44.725
Things have been going great with Trixy,
but, um, can I ask you a question?

19:44.808 --> 19:47.603
Is it still true love
if your wallet is missing?

19:47.686 --> 19:51.064
[groans] Enough with the Trixy.
Bean, how'd it go with your mom?

19:51.148 --> 19:53.817
I'm not sure. At first I thought
I was doing fine,

19:53.901 --> 19:56.945
but then I got all mixed up.
I think she's onto me.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.157
Bean, you have to be careful.
We know what this woman's capable of.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.825
I mean, she tried to poison your dad.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.619
-Please understand…
-[all yelping]

20:03.702 --> 20:05.204
Stop doing that!

20:05.287 --> 20:08.457
Cloyd and Becky told me Zøg was evil
and had to be stopped.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.668
I swear, Bean,
I meant him no permanent harm,

20:11.752 --> 20:13.295
and I intend to prove it to you.

20:13.378 --> 20:17.299
I don't see how. We don't even know
if Dad recovered from his bullet wound.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.093
-Did you know that I shot Dad?
-Everybody knows that.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.472
I don't even know if Dad
is alive and kicking or dead and buried.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.557
Oh, Bean,
I don't think that's happened yet,

20:25.641 --> 20:27.351
but what if I helped you find out?

20:28.227 --> 20:32.314
I'm sure you recognize these floor plans
from your heist. My baby's first felony.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.690
They killed Slappo, you know.

20:33.774 --> 20:37.903
No, Slappo's still alive,
and those sweet, snarling dogs, too.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.322
Now, I've drawn in
the Trøgs' secret tunnels.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.700
Here's the one I had them use to get
the music box back into your bedroom.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.328
Here's the one that goes straight
to Dad's room. I'll use it--

20:46.411 --> 20:49.289
I'm afraid not.
The passages are only big enough for Trøgs

20:49.373 --> 20:51.541
and those aren't tunneling thighs, dear.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.877
-But perhaps your little elf friend…
-[chuckles]

20:53.961 --> 20:58.298
Um, her little elf friend can speak
for himself. Bean, what should I do?

21:00.425 --> 21:02.594
Follow the tunnel to Zøg's bedchamber.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.264
When you've delivered Bean's message,
pull the rope twice.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.057
If he's okay, tell him I'm alive.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.476
And if you get a chance,
can you bring me my blue hairbrush?

21:09.559 --> 21:12.396
It should be on the nightstand,
but Bunty might have moved it.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.605
Mmm-hmm.

21:14.815 --> 21:15.816
[grunts]

21:15.899 --> 21:17.609
Somebody kick my ass?

21:18.819 --> 21:19.736
[grunts]

21:29.329 --> 21:31.581
-I'm alive.
-Yeah, so what?

21:38.046 --> 21:39.965
Bean is alive, too…

21:40.048 --> 21:43.135
[screaming and grunting]

21:45.012 --> 21:46.680
Oh, hello, ghost of Elfo!

21:46.763 --> 21:48.265
[clanging]

21:49.433 --> 21:50.642
[screaming]

21:53.020 --> 21:55.939
[grunts] Ow!

21:57.399 --> 22:00.277
Elfo, quit clowning around.
Is my dad alive?

22:00.902 --> 22:03.613
Yes. Am I? [grunts]

22:04.197 --> 22:06.825
-[Bean] Oh, Mom, thank you!
-You're hugging me.

22:06.908 --> 22:10.203
It's the first time I've hugged you
since you tried to kill me.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.748
And I'm not letting you go this time.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.083
What about my needs?

22:18.754 --> 22:22.049
Bean's still alive!
I got somethin' to live for!

22:22.132 --> 22:23.967
I'm glad you didn't bash in my head.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.595
There's plenty of other heads
we could bash in, sire.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.765
Listen. You're the only guy I trust,
except that elf on the rope.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.225
Where'd he go? Anyway, here's the plan.

22:32.309 --> 22:38.190
The only way Odval and the Archdruidess
will let me outta here is if I'm dead.

22:38.273 --> 22:42.360
So you go get a coffin, drag it up here,
and stick me in it.

22:42.444 --> 22:46.615
So you do want me to kill you?
Okay, sounds like a plan.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.242
-[grunts]
-Hold on, let me finish, dumbass!

22:49.326 --> 22:52.996
You nail me into the coffin,
you tell everybody I died,

22:53.080 --> 22:55.749
wheel me outta town,
go get Turbish and Mertz,

22:55.832 --> 22:58.126
and we'll figure out
how to bust this conspiracy

22:58.210 --> 23:00.420
from the safety
of my secret royal hideaway.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.839
Great! Where is
your secret royal hideaway?

23:02.923 --> 23:06.760
It's an unmarked castle about
20 miles from here. You can't miss it.

23:11.973 --> 23:15.685
Your Majesty, I crave an audience.
Put down the dolls.

23:15.769 --> 23:16.603
Granted.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.147
As you may know,
I'm something of a swine vivant.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.734
I and my fellow scallywags
find it increasingly hard

23:22.818 --> 23:26.363
to carouse in the face
of all your new religious edicts.

23:26.446 --> 23:29.741
I'd like to help you
if I could understand you, Pig Merkimer.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.327
I'm talking about roistering and rutting!

23:32.410 --> 23:36.706
Consecrating our desires
without fear of reprisal or castigation.

23:36.790 --> 23:40.252
Sire, you must revoke
your pronouncements posthaste!

23:40.335 --> 23:43.171
I don't know if Odval
or Purple Mommy would approve.

23:43.255 --> 23:48.051
But you are king. I beg of you on behalf
of all the deviants of Dreamland.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.761
[chuckles]

23:50.387 --> 23:54.307
[clears throat]
Come along, Your Majesty. It's edict time.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.435
Ugh, shouldn't you be
wallowing in your own filth?

23:57.519 --> 23:59.855
If only! You know that's been banned.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.441
Remember the wankers!

24:06.153 --> 24:09.030
[Derek groans] "Edict number 43."

24:09.114 --> 24:14.202
"All executed shall endow their clothing
to Odval or the Archdruidess,

24:14.286 --> 24:16.788
depending upon who looks best in it."

24:16.872 --> 24:18.290
That was one of mine.

24:18.373 --> 24:23.670
Hmm. These are getting pretty arbitrary.
Maybe Merkimer was right.

24:23.753 --> 24:26.548
Why can't I be arbitrary, too? I'm king.

24:27.257 --> 24:31.928
New edict! "From now on, all weirdos
get to do whatever they want!"

24:32.012 --> 24:33.263
"Except Weirdo."

24:33.346 --> 24:35.515
"That noise he makes
really creeps me out."

24:36.141 --> 24:37.225
He's going off-scroll!

24:37.309 --> 24:40.687
I like this. Let's see. "From now on,

24:40.770 --> 24:43.732
disputes will be resolved
by pancake eating contests."

24:44.566 --> 24:49.279
Um… "All rocking horses must be built
to support the huskiest of boys."

24:49.946 --> 24:53.200
"A statue shall be erected
in honor of my dear sister Bean,

24:53.283 --> 24:56.453
and maybe a sandwich at the deli
can be named after Elfo and Luci."

24:56.536 --> 24:58.371
Faster, before he gives it all away!

24:58.455 --> 25:02.000
"And a socialist utopia
shall be established that will--"

25:02.083 --> 25:03.210
[grunts]

25:03.793 --> 25:06.171
Ceremony's over. Go in peace!

25:06.254 --> 25:12.135
Inquisition starts in five,
four, three, two…

25:12.219 --> 25:13.887
-[screaming]
-You better run!

25:17.891 --> 25:19.434
[smacks lips and blows]

25:20.101 --> 25:22.395
So long, cruel jerks. [chuckles]

25:25.523 --> 25:28.693
Bang it down tight.
I'm only gonna be in here like an hour.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.949
That's the final nail
in your coffin, sire.

25:34.616 --> 25:38.870
Ah, nuts, my cigar went out.
I didn't pack enough for the whole hour.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.664
Go and prepare the escape wagon!

25:40.747 --> 25:42.082
Yes, sire!

25:42.832 --> 25:45.627
[laughing] I'm a goddamn genius.

-[grunts]

25:50.966 --> 25:52.175
[groans]

26:07.732 --> 26:09.359
What is this stuff?

26:10.944 --> 26:13.196
-[sniffs] Hmm.
-[door closes]

26:13.280 --> 26:14.864
[gasps]

26:14.948 --> 26:16.616
[grunts]

26:21.538 --> 26:23.707
Oh, no! The sacred goo!

26:24.457 --> 26:28.378
That's enough, Yugo. You've gotta
feed Dagmar her midnight snack.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.630
[groans] I knew this day would come.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.008
Don't worry, you won't remember a thing.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.029
[knocking]

26:58.867 --> 27:01.119
Mom, what's the deal with the crazy music?

27:01.202 --> 27:05.248
I thought we were past that.
It's catchy, but you gotta cut it out.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.625
Mom? I'm talking to you.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.545
Mom! Mom!

27:11.254 --> 27:12.964
[screams]

27:13.048 --> 27:14.758
Hiya, Princess!

27:21.723 --> 27:24.142
Hey, Pendergast,
it's gettin' stuffy in here.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.188
Let's go, already!

27:30.106 --> 27:31.441
Pendergast?

27:31.524 --> 27:33.610
What are you doing up on that pole?

27:33.693 --> 27:35.445
[yelping]

27:35.528 --> 27:37.906
Open it up! Help.

27:37.989 --> 27:41.534
-Help! Help! Where you takin' me?
-[thunder rumbling]

27:42.118 --> 27:43.203
Whaddaya doin'?

27:45.663 --> 27:49.125
The wagon wheels are so spooky
on the cobblestone!

27:49.209 --> 27:53.046
I don't like that sound no more.
I used to but now I don't.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.841
Aw, come on! What's goin' on?

27:58.259 --> 27:59.427
[yells]

27:59.511 --> 28:00.804
-[coffin thuds]
-[Zøg] Hey!

28:02.472 --> 28:05.850
Whaddaya doin'?
You're just gonna leave me in here?

28:06.976 --> 28:08.686
You're not gonna say nothin'?

28:10.563 --> 28:12.774
Shaddup. [laughing maniacally]

28:12.857 --> 28:15.318
[Zøg yelping and screaming]
