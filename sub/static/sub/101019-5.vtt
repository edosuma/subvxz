09:46.712 --> 09:48.964
a little weird to hear you
and your friends talk about me

09:48.964 --> 09:51.008
like I'm some sort of dumb jock.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.135
‐ They were just joking around.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.470
‐ I'm sorry. I'm just...

09:55.470 --> 09:57.806
messed up right now.
And it's not your fault.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.850
It's just...

09:59.850 --> 10:02.060
I'm, I'm gonna head home.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.354
‐ Okay.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.150
‐ You guys really do sound great, though.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.491
Uh, hey, I have a lot of homework,

10:16.491 --> 10:19.536
so I'm gonna get going.
But, uh, I'll see you tomorrow?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.705
‐ Yeah. Sure.
‐ Okay. All right. Bye, guys.

10:21.705 --> 10:22.748
‐ Yep.
MIA: Bye.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.336
‐ Actually, I think I'm gonna
head out, too.

10:27.336 --> 10:30.255
I gotta get up at the ass crack of dawn
for practice tomorrow.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.882
You mind hanging with Mia?

10:31.882 --> 10:33.467
LUCY: Yeah, of course.
‐ Oh, okay.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.801
‐ Cool. Well, thank you.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.934
‐ Hey, Shelby.
SHELBY: Oh.

10:41.934 --> 10:44.394
You have a little extra pep
in your step today.

10:44.394 --> 10:48.524
‐ Just feeling good about
where I'm at in my life. You know?

10:48.524 --> 10:50.359
ISABEL:
Armando and I were intimate.

10:51.693 --> 10:56.365
We're just separated. We're still married,
so it's not a sin. [laughs]

10:56.365 --> 10:59.743
Although I guess he would be
the judge of that. [laughs]

10:59.743 --> 11:02.246
[clears throat]
We're having dinner

11:02.246 --> 11:04.748
to talk about getting back together.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.333
We have our problems, but, I, I,

11:06.333 --> 11:08.710
I really want things to work out.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.629
‐ What kind of problems?

11:10.629 --> 11:15.759
He... He doesn't really know
how to talk about his emotions.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.636
‐ Yeah, it's like since
I started coming here,

11:17.636 --> 11:20.264
I feel way more in touch with my feelings.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.474
You know? And‐‐ thanks.

11:22.474 --> 11:26.353
And it just feels so good to not have
everything bottled up inside.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.146
I feel like I'm growing as a person,

11:28.146 --> 11:31.942
which feels dumb to say,
since I'm in my forties.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.027
‐ Oh, no. It's not dumb.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.905
Having a kid come out,
it changes you.

11:36.905 --> 11:40.534
I mean, last month,
I went to drag queen bingo.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.787
‐ How was that?
‐ It's... fun.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.623
I barely recognize
the woman I used to be.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.877
All because my kid was brave enough
to say "I'm gay."

11:49.877 --> 11:53.463
FATHER LAWRENCE:
He is? When did he share this with you?

11:53.463 --> 11:55.674
‐ A couple months back.

11:55.674 --> 11:59.052
Armando has been surprisingly
accepting of all of this,

11:59.052 --> 12:01.763
considering his machismo.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.849
But I am struggling.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.227
And I, I know...

12:07.227 --> 12:11.064
I know that Victor didn't choose
to be this way...

12:11.064 --> 12:13.192
‐ You're a good mother.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.776
That's very clear.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.529
But I think you're, you're right

12:17.529 --> 12:18.906
to express your disapproval,

12:18.906 --> 12:20.949
if you want Victor to know God's love.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.328
‐ Oh.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.455
‐ You sound disappointed.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.584
‐ That's what I was always taught.

12:30.584 --> 12:34.171
I just thought maybe the church
was a little more flexible nowadays.

12:34.171 --> 12:38.133
‐ Do you think God is in the business
of providing loopholes? [chuckles]

12:38.133 --> 12:40.010
ARMANDO:
I just thank God for giving me the courage

12:40.010 --> 12:42.137
to come here, and...

12:42.137 --> 12:43.722
to love my son for who he is.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.308
‐ Oh... [laughs softly]

12:48.519 --> 12:49.853
Meeting's starting.
‐ Right.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.277
‐ [grunts] Oof.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.159
‐ I thought you were done with basketball.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.245
‐ Andrew, what are you doing?
You following me now?

13:06.245 --> 13:08.163
‐ Come on. Let's go.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.628
All right.

13:20.759 --> 13:21.969
You live for this.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.307
‐ [sighs] Listen.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.851
How many times do I have to tell you

13:28.851 --> 13:30.936
I'm not gonna be part of a team
that doesn't want me?

13:30.936 --> 13:34.106
‐ And how many times do I have to
tell you they will come around?

13:34.106 --> 13:35.691
‐ Right.

13:35.691 --> 13:38.694
Because I am "the least gay
gay person alive."

13:40.988 --> 13:42.948
‐ I'm guessing that was
a stupid thing to say.
‐ No.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.157
No, it was perfect.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.243
Please, tell me what's the exact level
of gay I should be.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.663
What is a perfect level of gay
that will keep everyone happy?

13:49.663 --> 13:52.749
Because apparently,
I'm too gay for the locker room,

13:52.749 --> 13:54.710
but I'm not gay enough
for Benji and his friends.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.503
So, where do I belong?

13:59.715 --> 14:02.509
‐ You belong on a basketball court.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.721
‐ [sighs] Let's say I do come back.

14:06.722 --> 14:11.185
What happens if one day I do
want to be more "gay gay?"

14:11.185 --> 14:13.729
And I change the way I dress,

14:13.729 --> 14:17.524
or, or I dye my hair pink.
Then what?

14:18.775 --> 14:20.777
‐ Are those things that you really want?

14:23.113 --> 14:26.283
‐ I think the pink hair thing
could be kind of dope.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.160
‐ Well, then, I think you should do it.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.662
If anyone has a problem with it,
they can answer to me.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.666
‐ Andrew,

14:34.666 --> 14:37.836
do you really think that you're an ally
because you watch Queer Eye?

14:37.836 --> 14:40.005
This whole time,
you haven't said shit to the guys

14:40.005 --> 14:41.673
that don't want me changing
in the locker room with them.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.217
Because at the end of the day,

14:43.217 --> 14:45.302
you don't want to risk your
reputation for the gay kid.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.433
[Victor grunts]

14:53.894 --> 14:56.230
‐ Benji and Victor are such a hot couple.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.065
Not that you and Victor
weren't a hot couple.
[Mia chuckles]

14:58.065 --> 14:59.900
You guys were a really hot couple.

14:59.900 --> 15:03.403
But I should just stop talking.
‐ [laughs] It's okay.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.739
I just want Victor to be happy.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.283
I want all my friends to be happy.

15:08.283 --> 15:12.162
You, uh, seem to make Andrew very happy.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.497
‐ Oh, thanks.

15:14.665 --> 15:16.416
[chuckles]

15:16.416 --> 15:20.504
To be honest, I'm surprised
we've lasted this long.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.422
‐ Really? Why?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.175
‐ We're just so opposite.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.427
Earlier this summer when we hooked up,

15:27.427 --> 15:29.805
I just thought it was gonna be,
like, a hot fling.

15:29.805 --> 15:32.349
And then suddenly I'm his girlfriend...

15:34.852 --> 15:36.770
Can I ask you something?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.564
‐ Sure. Yeah. What's up?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.025
‐ When we were at the cabin,

15:42.025 --> 15:45.404
I saw you and Andrew outside together.

15:45.404 --> 15:48.323
And it just seemed like...
I don't know.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.868
There was something about the way
you were looking at each other...

15:54.454 --> 15:56.582
Is there something going on?

15:59.793 --> 16:02.004
‐ We hooked up once.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.632
A long time ago.
But there's nothing between us now.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.675
I swear.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.927
‐ Hmm.

16:10.345 --> 16:13.432
‐ Is that, "Hmm, that's so random."

16:13.432 --> 16:16.894
Or, "Hmm, hold my earrings.
I'm about to clock a bitch."

16:16.894 --> 16:22.107
[both laughing]
‐ No, it's fine. Um, I'm just surprised.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.526
Andrew never mentioned it.

16:24.526 --> 16:28.197
‐ I'm, I'm sure he just didn't
want to make you feel weird.

16:28.197 --> 16:31.533
‐ I don't. I mean, feel weird.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.328
I should feel a little weird, though,
shouldn't I?

16:36.580 --> 16:38.498
I mean, if I really cared
about this relationship,

16:38.498 --> 16:41.001
shouldn't I, like, feel something?

16:42.127 --> 16:43.795
‐ I shouldn't have said anything.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.882
‐ No. No, I'm really glad that you did.

16:46.882 --> 16:49.635
This is... really helpful.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.014
[Lucy sighs]

16:56.975 --> 17:00.145
♪ But you found somebody new ♪

17:02.022 --> 17:04.608
‐ That was divine.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.194
The perfect meal on the perfect plates.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.238
Tres chic. Where did you get them?

17:09.238 --> 17:11.740
‐ Oh, thank you. They're family heirlooms.

17:11.740 --> 17:15.077
LAKE: Mmm.
‐ So, who wants dessert?

17:15.077 --> 17:18.288
‐ Oh, uh, thank you,
but I should probably get going.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.249
We have a test on the
Hundred Years' War tomorrow

17:20.249 --> 17:23.627
and pretty much all I know
is how long it is.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.296
‐ It's actually
a hundred and sixteen years.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.090
‐ Are you freaking kidding me?

17:28.090 --> 17:29.299
‐ Oh.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.679
‐ I'm sure Lake will be back soon, Mom.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.599
‐ I'm gonna start cleaning up.

17:42.271 --> 17:45.649
‐ Well, hey, she's like me, you know?
Always...

17:45.649 --> 17:48.026
down to keep partying. [laughs]

17:51.363 --> 17:52.906
‐ I want you to have these.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.241
And if you give me a couple minutes,

17:54.241 --> 17:55.576
I can wash the ones that we used tonight,

17:55.576 --> 17:56.618
and then you can take those home, too.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.161
FELIX: What are you talking about, Mom?
‐It's j‐‐

17:58.161 --> 18:01.164
‐ Those are our plates.
‐ Well, I, I know, but she likes 'em,

18:01.164 --> 18:04.334
and I want her to have them.
Felix, help me find a box.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.295
‐ She's not taking our plates, Mom.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.880
‐ Felix, I told you,

18:07.880 --> 18:10.007
she likes 'em, and I want her to have 'em.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.094
[Dawn muttering]
[plates clattering]

18:15.387 --> 18:17.347
‐ Did you take your medication
this morning?

18:17.347 --> 18:18.932
‐ Why are you asking me that?
Are you trying to embarrass me?

18:18.932 --> 18:22.603
‐ No! I mean, um, I'm, I'm sure he's not.

18:22.603 --> 18:26.565
Uh... [sighs] You know,
this is just so generous,

18:26.565 --> 18:29.818
and, you know, we have our own
family heirloom plates.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.196
I, I wouldn't want there to be
any heirloom envy‐‐

18:32.196 --> 18:34.489
‐ You know what? Fine!
[shattering]

18:50.923 --> 18:53.800
It was really nice to meet you, Lake.

Really.

‐ Yeah.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.940
Yeah, no. Um...
‐ Here.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.275
‐ You know, this just‐‐
it happens sometimes.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.694
When, uh, she takes new medication,

19:12.694 --> 19:15.572
she comes out of her depression,
and then she stops taking it,

19:15.572 --> 19:17.783
and then she has a manic episode.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.660
You know, I don't even know
why I thought this time

19:19.660 --> 19:22.579
would be different. [laughs] Um...

19:22.579 --> 19:25.123
I‐‐
‐ I think we need to get you some help.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.215
She just needs to take it.
I'll get her back on them.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.425
‐ Okay. Well, this is serious,

19:35.425 --> 19:36.718
and, and I just really think

19:36.718 --> 19:38.637
it's too much for you to handle.
‐ N‐no.

19:39.638 --> 19:40.639
No.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.518
I have been handling this alone...

19:44.518 --> 19:45.894
for years.

I need you to promise me
you won't tell anyone what happened.

‐ Well, I had a long talk with the guys
about you rejoining the team.

20:38.822 --> 20:42.826
And, and this is our way of saying that

20:42.826 --> 20:45.996
you can be as gay as you want,
in whatever way that you want,

20:45.996 --> 20:50.209

for him anymore.

I don't mind.

No, no, I‐I really don't want
to watch you shower.

have to decide right now. So...

I interviewed Sarah Jessica Parker

Okay, Mando, I'm just gonna jump right in.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.329
‐ Okay.

24:56.747 --> 24:59.875
‐ The affair with Roger...

24:59.875 --> 25:04.880
It broke something,
and that is my fault.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.590
And I am so sorry that I,

25:06.590 --> 25:09.134
I pressured you so hard to get over it.

25:09.134 --> 25:12.471
‐ No. But our problems
started before that.

25:12.471 --> 25:16.183
Yeah, I‐I think the real reason
we separated was because

25:16.183 --> 25:18.435
we were stuck in a pattern,

25:18.435 --> 25:21.480
and the only way to get un‐stuck
is if we both change.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.986
That's why I keep asking you
to come to PFLAG with me.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.321
And every time you say no,

25:29.321 --> 25:33.075
it just feels like
you don't want to change.
‐ I do want to.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.870
I went to see Father Lawrence yesterday,

25:36.870 --> 25:38.705
to talk about everything.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.290
‐ How'd it go?

25:40.290 --> 25:44.878
‐ He said if... Victor chooses this path,

25:44.878 --> 25:46.797
that he will never know God's love.

25:48.340 --> 25:51.802
And I'm thinking, how can that be?

25:51.802 --> 25:56.807
He is such a good son.
He is such a good person...

25:56.807 --> 25:58.642
Why is this happening to him?

25:58.642 --> 26:01.353
‐ Is‐Isa, it's not happening to him, okay?

26:01.353 --> 26:03.063
It's just who he is.

26:04.982 --> 26:07.442
You know, this whole thing with Victor,
it's...

26:07.442 --> 26:09.778
It's made me really look at myself,

26:09.778 --> 26:12.114
and really try and change.

26:17.536 --> 26:20.789
But if you're not going to change with me,

26:24.710 --> 26:27.462
I don't know what the future holds.

26:36.847 --> 26:39.433
‐ Andrew. What are you doing here?

26:40.809 --> 26:43.187
‐ Lucy broke up with me.

26:43.187 --> 26:45.063
She spent one night talking to you,

26:45.063 --> 26:47.274
and she broke up with me.
‐ [sighs] Oh, my God.

26:47.274 --> 26:48.942
I'm so sorry.

26:48.942 --> 26:53.530
‐Lucy, she asked me if anything
had ever happened between us,

26:53.530 --> 26:55.782
and I felt like I had to be honest.

26:56.575 --> 26:59.203
But I really never meant to‐‐
‐ Mia...

26:59.203 --> 27:00.704
‐ Yes?

27:01.747 --> 27:03.040
‐ It's okay.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.752
‐ It is?
‐ Yeah.

27:09.046 --> 27:10.672
‐ Why is your hair pink?

27:12.758 --> 27:14.885
‐ I was trying to make things
right with Victor.

27:14.885 --> 27:18.388
Which is actually your fault, too.

27:19.348 --> 27:21.099
‐ Why is that my fault?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.563
‐ For as long as I can remember,

27:26.563 --> 27:29.107
anytime I wanted to take the easy way out,

27:29.107 --> 27:32.986
there was always this annoying voice
in the back of my head,

27:32.986 --> 27:36.114
pushing me to do better.
To be better.

27:37.366 --> 27:38.992
You know whose voice that is?

27:41.870 --> 27:45.749
Even when you're not around me,
I always hear you.

27:45.749 --> 27:49.628
So, when Lucy ended it,

27:49.628 --> 27:51.338
I figured, hey.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.382
I've taken a million shots with you,

27:53.382 --> 27:56.093
but I am about to take a million and one.
