00:16.167 --> 00:20.375
Sure, it may look like any other
ordinary guest castle from out here,

00:20.458 --> 00:24.375
but inside lies
the ultimate entertainer's retreat.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.750
Behold, Golden Queen!

00:26.833 --> 00:28.583
My evil lair!

00:30.667 --> 00:35.042
Oh, what is small, red, and whispers?

00:35.125 --> 00:37.250
A hoarse radish.
Get it?

00:39.292 --> 00:43.167
Hoarse. Not like a horse you ride,
the other kind.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.500
Yeah, you're pretty awful,
ain't ya, Broccoli Guy?

00:46.583 --> 00:48.792
Yes, I am.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.792
I went for the eucalyptus massage,
but they gave me Olaf.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.833
No denying, the guy
can work a knot out of an oak tree,

00:56.917 --> 00:59.792
but he gets a little handsy for my taste.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.333
Glumshanks!
What is going on here?

01:02.417 --> 01:04.792
They're your new roommates, sir.
I tried to stop them,

01:04.875 --> 01:06.542
but I got sidetracked
by a conversation

01:06.625 --> 01:08.667
with the hirsute gentleman
holding the bone harp

01:08.750 --> 01:12.250
about the origins of stringed instruments
and the next thing you know--

01:12.333 --> 01:13.708
What are you blathering about?

01:13.792 --> 01:15.208
Is there a problem, Kaos?

01:15.292 --> 01:17.875
My Doom Raiders and I
need a place to lie low,

01:17.958 --> 01:20.750
and since your hovel
is hidden by a cloak of dark magic

01:20.833 --> 01:23.083
that keeps it
from being detected by the Skylanders,

01:23.167 --> 01:24.167
it is...

01:24.250 --> 01:26.042
- adequate.
- His hovel?

01:26.125 --> 01:28.667
I thought this was your place, Queen.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.708
You know, 'cause your photos
are plastered everywhere.

01:31.417 --> 01:34.875
I just wanted
Your Golden-ness to feel at home.

01:34.958 --> 01:38.625
You know, with walls covered
with your own image, as one does.

01:38.708 --> 01:41.167
Goldie, is that you?

01:41.250 --> 01:43.667
Oh. Kaossandra.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.667
Oh, Goldie, you silly monarch,

01:46.750 --> 01:49.167
you know it's just "Kassandra".
The "o" is silent.

01:49.250 --> 01:52.583
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You two know each other?

01:52.667 --> 01:55.917
Sure, we used to see each other
at Soulless Cycle all the time.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.083
Anyway, Goldie, let's catch up.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.583
How was life in prison?

01:59.667 --> 02:01.708
Not bad.
Not bad, thank you.

02:01.792 --> 02:04.833
How's it been going having to admit
Kaos is your only offspring?

02:08.750 --> 02:14.042
My true love... is friends with my mother?

02:14.125 --> 02:16.875
Ah, yes,
you're in that idyllic grace period

02:16.958 --> 02:19.292
before she gets a restraining order.

02:49.417 --> 02:53.667
Skylanders, I have summoned you here
in the middle of nature

02:53.750 --> 02:57.375
for a mission of the utmost importance.
A team building retreat.

02:57.458 --> 02:58.458
Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

02:58.542 --> 03:02.167
I've got the best trust building activity
that we can all do.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.083
A secret team handshake.

03:04.167 --> 03:06.083
I was thinking something like...

03:06.167 --> 03:07.625
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

03:07.708 --> 03:10.083
- Oh! Up high! Ooh, to the side.
- Now, what was that part?

03:10.167 --> 03:13.583
I'm pretty sure that was a,
uh, reference to an exchange of currency.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.417
-Right? I take, you take.
-Boo-yah!

03:15.500 --> 03:16.750
I see what you did there.

03:16.833 --> 03:19.208
-No, I'm not sure.
-Everybody got it? Who's next?

03:19.292 --> 03:20.875
Camp snacks! Yeah!

03:20.958 --> 03:22.750
Now we just need a crackling fire.

03:22.833 --> 03:24.208
Crackling's my middle name.

03:24.292 --> 03:25.708
You told me it was Agnew.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.875
And I'll concoct
the perfect artisanal flavor coating,

03:29.958 --> 03:32.458
guaranteed to leave us wanting s'more!

03:32.542 --> 03:33.792
Ha!

03:33.875 --> 03:36.667
S'more! Get it?
Man, I'm punny!

03:36.750 --> 03:39.916
You guys, I don't think
this is the kind of team building

03:40.000 --> 03:41.917
Master Eon had in mind.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.417
Alas! You are correct, Elf.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.167
But let's see
how this artisanal flavoring plays out.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.667
Sir, I know you feel like
your personal space has been violated,

03:52.750 --> 03:55.625
but maybe you should try to
get to know the Doom Raiders.

03:55.708 --> 03:58.583
After all, they are Golden Queen's
trusted foot soldiers.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.042
Maybe they could put in
a few good words for you with her?

04:01.125 --> 04:03.583
Glummy, you insufferable genius!

04:03.667 --> 04:06.500
That is the best idea
I will ever take credit for.

04:06.583 --> 04:08.042
I'm a giver, sir.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.083
Yo, Wolfgang!

04:11.167 --> 04:12.458
What up, dawg!

04:12.542 --> 04:13.833
Dawg?

04:14.417 --> 04:15.625
I'm a werewolf.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.750
Don't you ever get the two confused.

04:17.833 --> 04:20.208
Sorry!
You know, I just thought,

04:20.291 --> 04:22.333
you know, now that we're, uh,
we're gonna be roommates

04:22.417 --> 04:24.792
that, uh, we were, you know, homies, too!

04:24.875 --> 04:28.250
We ain't homies...
and we definitely ain't roommates!

04:28.333 --> 04:31.708
This is our place now.

04:31.792 --> 04:34.625
If we're gonna live here,
we totally need to redecorate.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.375
-There is so much gross stuff everywhere.
-Like what?

04:37.458 --> 04:40.083
For starters, what's up
with the body pillow in the corner

04:40.167 --> 04:42.083
with a picture
of the Queen's face on it?

04:42.167 --> 04:44.375
That's not mine!
It came with the guest castle!

04:44.458 --> 04:48.083
Hey, bald boy. This here bathtub
is gonna be my cooking pot.

04:48.167 --> 04:49.833
I hope you don't mind!

04:49.917 --> 04:51.792
We sure don't.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.542
That's it.
I'm out of here!

04:58.000 --> 05:00.583
- There's no place like...
- Om.

05:01.917 --> 05:04.333
Peace out, dumb raiders!

05:05.500 --> 05:07.083
Our next exercise

05:07.167 --> 05:10.958
involves putting complete trust
in one's fellow Skylander,

05:11.042 --> 05:12.542
by letting go.

05:12.625 --> 05:15.083
Um... ready when you are.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.333
Timber!

05:16.417 --> 05:19.542
Wow! Spyro,
what a light, fluffy touch you have.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.042
-Now me!
-Uh, maybe--

05:22.708 --> 05:24.000
And now, it's my turn.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.792
I'll just assume I'll be inevitably caught
without incident,

05:26.875 --> 05:29.500
as is the point of this...

05:29.583 --> 05:32.875
Master Eon,
your hands feel like hard earth.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.125
Eon?

05:37.167 --> 05:42.292
Can't cook marshmallows over an open fire
without proper sticks. Perfect.

05:43.667 --> 05:46.000
Now to follow the trail back to camp.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.542
Oh, sheep.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.875
Wait, wait, is it on three,
or is it three then pull?

05:51.958 --> 05:53.375
I can't feel my...

05:53.458 --> 05:54.958
...everything.

05:55.042 --> 05:57.708
I better go find Eon
so I can get you guys re-focused

05:57.792 --> 06:01.458
on your team building
instead of team flattening.

06:04.333 --> 06:08.083
Ah, nothing like a little float
through the forest to clear one's head.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.208
What the--

06:09.292 --> 06:10.500
Skylanders?

06:13.083 --> 06:15.417
They have no idea that I'm here,

06:15.500 --> 06:18.792
which means it's the perfect opportunity
to sneak attack,

06:18.875 --> 06:22.583
destroy them all,
and finally impress Golden Queen.

06:22.667 --> 06:23.750
And Mother!

06:23.833 --> 06:26.000
And get my lair back!

06:26.083 --> 06:28.542
Actually any two of those things will do.

06:29.958 --> 06:31.208
Whoa!

06:31.292 --> 06:33.375
These are trippy marshmallows.

06:33.458 --> 06:37.125
I see Kaos' big floating head
coming right at us.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.542
I am coming right at you, soda jerk.

06:39.625 --> 06:42.750
And now it's time
to choke on some evil electricity,

06:42.833 --> 06:44.792
Skysuckers!

06:44.875 --> 06:48.458
Ah! No! Not my artisanal flavoring!

06:51.875 --> 06:53.167
No sign of him.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.167
I guess Master Eon went back to camp.

06:57.750 --> 07:01.042
That's not a team building
exercise scream. That's a...

07:01.125 --> 07:03.917
someone blew up
the bag of marshmallows scream!

07:05.375 --> 07:07.375
Whoa!

07:07.458 --> 07:08.917
Missed me!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.542
Kaos?

07:11.625 --> 07:13.250
Ha-yah!

07:13.333 --> 07:15.417
What the...

07:15.500 --> 07:18.167
Hey! Get out of my head!

07:23.417 --> 07:25.667
Well, looks like I just fried ninja girl.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.875
You know, it's good to set goals
and accomplish them.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.000
Well, see ya.

07:35.208 --> 07:37.542
Ah, sorry for the delay, Elf.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.125
I lost my way in the forest
while collecting wood.

07:43.333 --> 07:46.083
Bull's-eye!

07:46.167 --> 07:47.208
Hey now, I got next.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.792
Hey, what are you doing back there?

07:57.125 --> 07:58.917
I'm laughing.

08:00.458 --> 08:03.042
Fine, laugh it up! I don't care.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.583
Because I destroyed a Skylander today!

08:05.667 --> 08:08.875
-A real Skylander?
-Which one?

08:08.958 --> 08:12.000
That one, who does the thing.
Eh, with the blades.

08:12.083 --> 08:13.583
You know, she's got a mask?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.708
I mean, I think she's a she.
I never actually got a name.

08:17.375 --> 08:18.833
Lucky shot, sir.

08:18.917 --> 08:22.292
Uh, definitely not something
I've done hundreds of times before

08:22.375 --> 08:23.458
during your astral walkabouts.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.542
Where...

08:31.625 --> 08:33.292
Where am I?

08:34.167 --> 08:35.207
My blades!

08:35.292 --> 08:38.582
Doesn't matter,
I'll still chop that melon!

08:41.207 --> 08:42.457
Yah!

08:42.542 --> 08:44.167
What in the...

08:44.250 --> 08:46.292
Okay, explain this to me.

08:46.375 --> 08:48.542
Who takes 14 years to toilet train?

08:48.625 --> 08:50.458
Fourteen years!

08:50.542 --> 08:51.792
It didn't take me that long.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.833
Wait, why am I talking to...

08:54.917 --> 08:56.417
Kaos's mom?

08:56.500 --> 08:58.833
Well, you did me no favors
by lording over me

08:58.917 --> 09:01.250
every time I needed
a little "me" time, Mother!

09:01.333 --> 09:02.875
Well, this just got awkward.

09:02.958 --> 09:05.917
Hello?
Skylander in the house.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.875
Do you seriously not see me here?

09:08.875 --> 09:11.750
Wait a second.
They aren't real.

09:11.833 --> 09:14.250
I don't think I'm in Skylands anymore.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.125
Okay, tough guy.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.542
If you blew up a Skylander, then prove it.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.000
Okay, hold on.

09:22.083 --> 09:26.042
The last thing I remember, I got caught
in the line of Kaos's head fire.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.833
Did he blow me up?

09:28.917 --> 09:30.500
Is this Heaven?

09:30.583 --> 09:33.042
Hold up.
Okay, that's a mirror.

09:33.125 --> 09:37.042
I'm trapped inside Kaos's head?

09:37.750 --> 09:39.917
Nope, not Heaven.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.375
We shall always
remember Stealth Elf by these,

09:45.458 --> 09:48.417
her blades,
her most prized possessions.

09:48.500 --> 09:52.000
I think I should deliver the eulogy,
because I was her best friend.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.750
What? I was her best friend.

09:54.833 --> 09:58.250
Well... well, that's not
what she wrote in her secret diary.

09:58.333 --> 09:59.583
Uh, I'm guessing.

09:59.667 --> 10:03.250
Next! Thanks for coming in to interview
on such short notice, Ka-Boom.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.125
Now, just a few questions,
can you travel at lightning speed?

10:06.208 --> 10:07.292
Are you handy with blades?

10:07.375 --> 10:10.583
And are you okay
going by the name Stealth Elf?

10:10.667 --> 10:14.500
First, ludicrous.
Number two, I can rock a can opener.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.417
And if I get the job,
you can call me Tina!

10:19.375 --> 10:21.333
What are you doing, JV?

10:21.417 --> 10:24.583
No one can replace our Elfy!

10:24.667 --> 10:30.125
Yes, yes, Elf was a treasured teammate
that will never truly be replaced, but...

10:30.208 --> 10:32.292
well, the team is down one member

10:32.375 --> 10:34.750
and I'm sure we can all
make room in our hearts for Tanya here.

10:34.833 --> 10:35.833
Tina!

10:35.917 --> 10:38.917
Skylanders, there is no
one correct method of grieving.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.625
We are all dealing with this tragic loss
in our own private way.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.083
I just miss her so much.

10:45.167 --> 10:48.792
Yeah, yeah, let it all out, big guy.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.167
Did I get the job?

10:50.250 --> 10:53.333
We all played a part today
in Elf's demise.

10:53.417 --> 10:57.292
As her teammates, you should've been
taking the trust building exercise

10:57.375 --> 10:59.583
as seriously as Elf was.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.958
We're such bad teammates!

11:03.042 --> 11:05.083
There, there, Eruptor.

11:05.167 --> 11:06.792
I should have been there with you all

11:06.875 --> 11:09.333
when Kaos's head floated
into that clearing.

11:09.417 --> 11:13.667
If I hadn't had my trail to camp
foiled by a marshmallow-loving sheep.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.250
For this...

11:15.333 --> 11:17.417
I must make the ultimate sacrifice.

11:17.500 --> 11:22.583
The kind of sacrifice Elf made in taking
that blast from Kaos to save all of you.

11:22.667 --> 11:26.042
I will shave... my...

11:26.125 --> 11:27.375
beard!

11:28.125 --> 11:29.375
- Quite nice!
- Perfect.

11:29.458 --> 11:30.500
Pretty much the only thing you can do.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.417
No, no. Don't try to stop me.
It must be done.

11:33.583 --> 11:38.000
Okay, if I'm inside Kaos's head,
these phantoms must be his memories.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.333
And I am not going to
spend the rest of my life

11:40.417 --> 11:43.125
reliving his creepy,
evil-obsessed existence.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.125
Especially the potty training part.

11:45.208 --> 11:48.208
Elf, it's time to pop out
of this hot air balloon!

11:48.292 --> 11:50.958
Ha-yah!

11:54.667 --> 11:57.083
Huh.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.792
Oh...

12:10.875 --> 12:13.750
My boss has a death wish.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.333
I fold.

12:27.167 --> 12:30.375
Uh-oh. As long as
I'm trapped inside Kaos's head,

12:30.458 --> 12:32.708
whatever hurts him, hurts me.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.875
I need to find a way
out of here, fast!

12:34.958 --> 12:37.083
Mush! Mush!

12:38.292 --> 12:40.750
Wait. That never happened.

12:40.833 --> 12:42.375
So that definitely can't be a memory.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.250
Oh, Goldie!

12:44.333 --> 12:45.583
Peep this.

12:45.667 --> 12:46.875
Behold!

12:46.958 --> 12:52.167
I'm totally yolked from having to support
my unnaturally large head all these years.

12:52.250 --> 12:54.833
Ooh, yes you are...

12:54.917 --> 12:59.125
you dark, magic Adonis, you.

12:59.208 --> 13:00.250
Oh, wow.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.500
These definitely aren't memories.
These are fantasies!

13:03.583 --> 13:05.875
I need to get out of here
before I lose my mind!

13:05.958 --> 13:07.542
And my lunch.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.208
Glummy, why did I punch Wolfgang?

13:10.292 --> 13:11.458
No idea.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.917
If I had to posit a guess, sir,
I would say...

13:15.000 --> 13:16.958
-supernatural possession.
-Yes.

13:17.042 --> 13:19.625
It was as if I were possessed,
wasn't it?

13:19.708 --> 13:22.125
No, dummies!
It's me, Stealth Elf!

13:22.208 --> 13:23.917
I'm trapped inside your mind!

13:24.000 --> 13:26.125
Now release me already!

13:26.917 --> 13:28.833
Whoa, did you hear that, Glummy?

13:28.917 --> 13:30.667
I only hear
the echoes of regret

13:30.750 --> 13:32.542
from the poor life choices I've made, sir.

13:33.750 --> 13:37.125
Just a theory, but perhaps your
marginally provoked attack on Wolfgang

13:37.208 --> 13:40.833
was an effort to assert yourself
as the alpha male, sir.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.750
Studies have proven time and again

13:42.833 --> 13:46.375
that once the alpha has asserted his
dominance and won the respect of the pack,

13:46.458 --> 13:49.042
the females of said pack
are more than willing to pair

13:49.125 --> 13:52.375
with the alpha as their life mate.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.333
You're the alpha,
the Doom Raiders are the pack,

13:56.417 --> 13:58.667
and the Golden Queen is the female.

13:58.750 --> 14:02.375
-Come on, man, stay with me here.
-Right!

14:02.458 --> 14:06.833
Wow, Glumshanks, you are just
a cornucopia of amazing ideas today!

14:06.917 --> 14:09.083
Or just all the obvious ones, sir.

14:09.167 --> 14:13.833
All righty! Time to show that werepup
who's in charge around here

14:13.917 --> 14:15.542
and the Skylands!

14:15.625 --> 14:16.958
Oh, no, no, no.

14:17.042 --> 14:19.292
This is a very bad idea.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.583
Do not start a fight
with that guy, you idiot.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.292
Yo, Wolfgang.
What up...

14:24.375 --> 14:25.708
dawg?

14:25.792 --> 14:28.417
Did you just call me dawg?
Again?

14:28.500 --> 14:31.375
Oh, silly me.

14:31.458 --> 14:35.458
It's just that I saw you in the corner
sniffing your butt earlier.

14:35.542 --> 14:41.042
I mean, is that not something
big, bad werewolves do?

14:42.958 --> 14:45.458
I will end you!

14:45.542 --> 14:49.500
Yeah? Well not before I smack your nose
with a rolled-up magazine.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.167
By which I mean, my fists!

14:51.250 --> 14:54.083
Come on.

14:55.042 --> 14:57.500
He can't even insult properly!

14:59.708 --> 15:02.625
Test, test. Check, one, two.
One, two. Sibilance.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.542
- Sibilance.
- Sibilance.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.375
Oh, it's a sound check you want?

15:06.458 --> 15:09.292
Ha! Well, here's a sound you can check...

15:09.375 --> 15:11.292
every one of your bones breaking.

15:11.375 --> 15:15.208
Any final words
before I wipe the floor with your face?

15:15.292 --> 15:17.750
Okay, Elf, here goes... something!

15:18.500 --> 15:19.958
Here are some final words.

15:20.042 --> 15:21.542
I'm gonna wipe the floor with you,

15:21.625 --> 15:24.375
you mop with fangs.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.250
Okay.

15:30.333 --> 15:32.125
So you got lucky.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.583
It ain't gonna happen twice.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.583
Got your nose!

15:55.667 --> 15:57.250
Bad wolf!
Now go lay down.

16:04.792 --> 16:08.625
I'm stupendously stunned to say,
without one iota of sarcasm...

16:08.708 --> 16:10.250
well done, sir.

16:10.333 --> 16:13.250
Okay, time to
get this watermelon on tooth picks

16:13.333 --> 16:15.542
in front of the only people
who can get me out of here.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.875
Okay, so now you have their respect.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.250
What's your next move, sir?

16:19.333 --> 16:22.375
I'm going to see the Skylanders!

16:22.458 --> 16:25.125
Sure, 'cause that makes sense.

16:28.500 --> 16:32.250
Wait! I can't waltz through
enemy territory looking like Kaos!

16:32.333 --> 16:34.000
They'll end him and me on sight!

16:34.083 --> 16:35.667
Think, Elf, think!

16:40.458 --> 16:42.875
Eon has been gone for a while.

16:42.958 --> 16:46.292
Give him some time.
He's saying goodbye to his best friend.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.958
His soul mate.
His raison d'être.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.750
Call me crazy, but can't Eon just...

16:50.833 --> 16:53.292
grow another beard back
when the time is right?

16:54.667 --> 16:57.917
Oi! This is a private service.
No non-Skylanders allowed.

16:58.792 --> 17:03.375
Kaos? Oh, man,
you have some nerve showing your face...

17:03.458 --> 17:06.166
and the badly-drawn face
on the back of your head, in these parts.

17:07.250 --> 17:10.875
You are going down
for what you did to Stealth Elf, punk!

17:10.958 --> 17:13.833
Uh-oh! I have to let them know
that it's really me in here!

17:13.916 --> 17:15.875
Guys! Guys, it's me, Stealth Elf!

17:15.958 --> 17:18.208
I'm trapped inside Kaos's head!

17:18.291 --> 17:20.333
Yeah, right!
That's insane!

17:20.416 --> 17:25.583
Uh-uh. There's no way Elfy's stuck inside
that walking exercise ball.

17:25.666 --> 17:28.333
And now you're gonna pay
for what you did to my best friend.

17:28.416 --> 17:30.208
You mean, my best friend.

17:30.292 --> 17:31.292
Right, not the time.

17:31.375 --> 17:35.250
Guys, I'm controlling Kaos
like a video game from inside his mind!

17:35.333 --> 17:38.208
Do you think he'd seriously
just walk in here on his own?

17:38.292 --> 17:40.208
He's an idiot, but he's not that dumb!

17:40.292 --> 17:42.667
The idiot has a point.

17:42.750 --> 17:45.292
But we should probably
still beat him up just to be safe.

17:45.375 --> 17:48.000
-Wait, I can prove I'm Elf!
-Oh, yeah? How?

17:48.083 --> 17:50.542
By doing something
only your best ninja pal could.

17:50.625 --> 17:53.708
Such as...
our new secret team handshake.

17:53.792 --> 17:55.708
Remember?
The one from the retreat?

17:56.792 --> 18:01.042
Oh, yeah.
Ha! Ooh! Up high. Boo-yah!

18:01.667 --> 18:03.125
-Well?
-No.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.625
-I remember artisanal flavoring.
-I got nothing.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.917
I miss Elf so much.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.875
I know!

18:16.458 --> 18:20.125
Easy now. No one has to get hurt here.
Well, except maybe you.

18:20.208 --> 18:23.542
Wait, Kaos isn't trying to dice us up.
Why?

18:23.625 --> 18:26.250
Only Stealth Elf can bust out
ninja sword play like that.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.125
I think Kaos is telling the truth.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.542
Elf is inside his head.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.083
Well, there's only one way
to get her out of there.

18:32.167 --> 18:35.875
Hit Kaos so hard
that Elf pops out! Stand back!

18:39.625 --> 18:41.000
Eruptor, no!

18:41.083 --> 18:42.917
The whole point
of the team building retreat

18:43.000 --> 18:45.500
was that we need to
come together as a team!

18:45.583 --> 18:48.458
Okay, Kaos, we trust you.
Um, I mean Elf.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.375
Let's just get you out
of that big awful head already.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.250
But how do we do that?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.417
If Elf is playing Kaos like a video game,

18:55.500 --> 18:57.167
then there should be a way
to stop the game!

18:57.250 --> 19:00.292
Right! She should hit control-alt-delete
at the same time!

19:00.375 --> 19:01.542
Wrong tech, big guy.

19:01.625 --> 19:07.792
Try and toggle the controls
to eject your way out of there, Elf!

19:07.875 --> 19:09.542
I'm trapped, not deaf!

19:10.167 --> 19:13.167
Come on,

19:16.667 --> 19:17.917
Whoa. Whoa!

19:19.083 --> 19:21.083
Best trust fall ever!

19:21.167 --> 19:23.417
Oh, you're Tina!

19:23.500 --> 19:27.542
Elf, I am so happy to see you...
because you're my best friend!

19:27.625 --> 19:28.833
-Right?
-What?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.583
-I've never said that to you before.
-Of course, of course.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.750
And I definitely
didn't read it anywhere either.

19:33.833 --> 19:36.083
So, where's Master Eon?

19:36.792 --> 19:39.250
-What?
-You didn't shave your beard?

19:39.333 --> 19:42.458
Yes, yes, no that's right.
Well, you see, I am... I am.

19:42.542 --> 19:43.958
I was getting right on it.
Indeed.

19:44.042 --> 19:47.375
Yes, just... I just had to
come back for my favorite razor.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.500
I love that razor and...
Stealth Elf!

19:49.583 --> 19:52.250
I'm so glad to see you.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.917
I was about to make
the ultimate sacrifice in your honor.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.542
But crisis averted.
You're here now and my beard is untouched.

19:58.625 --> 20:00.292
Those are the important things.

20:00.375 --> 20:04.708
You guys know how much
I hate public display of affection, right?

20:04.792 --> 20:06.667
Guys?

20:06.750 --> 20:09.250
Fine, just this once.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.333
Good thing I followed you here.

20:11.417 --> 20:14.417
Taking on the Skylanders
by yourself in their backyard?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.542
Honestly, sir,
where would you be without me?

20:16.625 --> 20:17.875
In prison.

20:17.958 --> 20:19.542
Definitely homeless.

20:19.625 --> 20:22.792
Most likely missing some,
if not all, of your teeth.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.292
I wish I could remember anything

20:27.375 --> 20:30.208
about how I ended up
in enemy territory, Glummy.

20:30.292 --> 20:34.708
The last thing I do remember is...
I had just slapped...

20:35.458 --> 20:39.042
-Wolfgang!
-Kaos, on behalf of the Doom Raiders,

20:39.125 --> 20:42.000
I'm sorry we didn't believe
you destroyed a Skylander.

20:42.083 --> 20:45.917
'Cause it's now painfully clear that
anyone who can take down someone like me

20:46.000 --> 20:49.375
is totally capable
of putting a serious hurt on anyone.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.667
Ooh! Well, um...

20:51.750 --> 20:54.375
Yes, now you know, don't you?

20:54.458 --> 20:55.833
You... silly mutt!

20:55.917 --> 20:57.917
That was a pretty lousy insult.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.875
-So lame.
-I thought it was good.

20:59.958 --> 21:03.917
Well... you can just...
choke on a carrot, floret boy!

21:04.000 --> 21:06.167
And he's lost them.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.083
I thought you were a bad dude.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.125
I was gonna advise the Golden Queen

21:10.208 --> 21:14.083
to not only let you into our gang,
but that you should be our new leader!

21:14.167 --> 21:16.792
Well, um, is there
a talent portion of the competition?

21:16.875 --> 21:20.375
I can tap dance with a flaming baton.
Or a flaming Glumshanks!

21:23.250 --> 21:25.667
Had them in the palm of your hand, sir.

21:25.750 --> 21:29.333
Golden Queen would've been
all over new boss Kaos.

21:29.417 --> 21:32.917
But now? Hmm.
Back to the old plotting board.
