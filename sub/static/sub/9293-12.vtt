00:13.268 --> 00:15.700
How soon can you deploy
once we arrive?

00:15.767 --> 00:18.967
It'll take us two hours
to assemble the delivery system,

00:19.034 --> 00:21.234
and another hour
to install the bomb.

00:21.301 --> 00:24.034
<i>FAYED:
That's longer than I'd hoped.</i>

00:24.101 --> 00:25.500
Just remember, without us,

00:25.567 --> 00:28.001
you'd be delivering
your payload in weeks

00:28.067 --> 00:29.600
instead of hours.

00:29.665 --> 00:30.900
If we succeed today,

00:30.960 --> 00:34.860
<i>the Arabs and the West
will destroy each other.</i>

00:34.932 --> 00:37.369
Were you able to pick up
anything on Gredenko?

00:37.439 --> 00:38.408
BUCHANAN:
No.

00:38.469 --> 00:39.941
The Glasgow Street house
was deserted.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.202
I think I might have a lead.

00:41.265 --> 00:42.270
<i>BUCHANAN:
What is it?</i>

00:42.305 --> 00:43.781
<i>BAUER:
Charles Logan.
Logan?</i>

00:43.835 --> 00:44.873
<i>BUCHANAN:
He's at his retreat.</i>

00:44.906 --> 00:45.931
<i>He's under house arrest.</i>

00:45.965 --> 00:48.433
So you need Gredenko
to find Fayed.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.763
Can you help us?

00:49.838 --> 00:51.100
I never dealt with
Gredenko directly,

00:51.138 --> 00:52.703
but I know how
we can find him.

00:52.768 --> 00:54.100
How?
Through
Anatoly Markov.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.730
He's the Russian Consul General,
here in Los Angeles.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.263
I don't trust you.

00:58.338 --> 01:00.860
If you want to find Gredenko,
maybe it's time you started.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.601
You're taking a great
risk, Mr. President.

01:03.666 --> 01:05.600
You and I are both
sharing that risk, sir.

01:05.668 --> 01:07.803
<i>We have three more
nuclear weapons</i>

01:07.865 --> 01:08.900
loose in my country.

01:08.966 --> 01:10.761
I want a public statement
of support

01:10.835 --> 01:12.131
from your Prime Minister.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.270
And I want it to follow
right on the heels of Assad's.

01:14.307 --> 01:15.400
A public
endorsement of him

01:15.466 --> 01:17.263
could have grave
political consequences

01:17.337 --> 01:18.303
for the Prime Minister.

01:18.367 --> 01:19.862
Now, you tell
your Prime Minister

01:19.936 --> 01:22.302
that we have
a carrier group operating

01:22.368 --> 01:24.362
less than 25 miles
off his shores.

01:28.468 --> 01:30.063
It's armed.

01:30.138 --> 01:31.060
President's gonna die.

01:31.138 --> 01:32.633
There's nothing
you can do about it.

01:32.707 --> 01:34.943
<i>LENNOX:
You've got to put a stop
to this, Reed.</i>

01:34.966 --> 01:37.332
Sir, there must have
a moment when you were

01:37.405 --> 01:38.733
on board with
this plan.

01:38.805 --> 01:40.332
Did you change your mind
along the way?

01:40.407 --> 01:42.602
I need to know.

01:42.668 --> 01:45.430
I was against you
from the start.

01:45.508 --> 01:47.763
You're just as bad
as Fayed.

01:49.866 --> 01:50.872
<i>MAN:
All right, here we go</i>

01:50.905 --> 01:52.733
for a run-through,
everyone.

01:53.608 --> 01:54.761
What is this?

01:54.835 --> 01:56.162
Bomb!

01:58.338 --> 01:59.870
LOWRY:
Citadel has been hit.
Send a medical team.

01:59.908 --> 02:01.963
I repeat,
Citadel is down!

02:02.035 --> 02:04.003
Send a medical team now!

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:33.736 --> 02:35.163
I've got it.
Thank you.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.233
Let me be clear about this
before we go anywhere.

02:38.308 --> 02:40.603
You are a federal prisoner
under my custody.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.502
You do not make a move
unless I tell you to,

02:42.565 --> 02:43.861
you understand me?

02:43.938 --> 02:45.333
You don't have
to threaten me, Jack.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.860
I know what my role is.

02:46.938 --> 02:48.301
I just want to be of service.

02:48.365 --> 02:51.530
As far as I'm concerned,

02:51.606 --> 02:52.860
you'll never do anything

02:52.936 --> 02:55.703
that'll erase
what you've already done.

02:55.765 --> 02:58.600
I understand your anger, I do.

02:58.668 --> 03:01.062
But if you want
to find Gredenko,

03:01.138 --> 03:02.862
we should leave now.

03:06.338 --> 03:07.303
Get in the car.

03:08.365 --> 03:11.061
(engine starts)

03:28.308 --> 03:31.162
I haven't been outside
these gates in over a year.

03:33.236 --> 03:34.900
I'm sorry, Jack.

03:34.966 --> 03:36.931
You don't need me
to tell you what it's like

03:37.005 --> 03:38.703
to be locked up.
You're right, I don't.

03:40.766 --> 03:42.631
But I know how it feels
to be locked away

03:42.706 --> 03:43.781
from the rest of the world.

03:43.837 --> 03:45.803
Lonely.

03:48.008 --> 03:49.530
A silence.

03:49.608 --> 03:51.563
Plays with your sanity.

03:55.665 --> 03:57.732
But in that silence,
you can hear

03:57.808 --> 03:59.042
the voice of your deepest self.

04:01.067 --> 04:03.503
And if you listen
to that voice,

04:03.568 --> 04:05.933
you have a chance
to heal.

04:06.007 --> 04:07.000
(cell phone ringing)

04:11.338 --> 04:12.302
This is Bauer.

04:12.366 --> 04:13.401
Jack, it's Bill.

04:13.465 --> 04:15.003
Are you on your way
to the Consulate?

04:15.068 --> 04:16.329
Yes.

04:16.408 --> 04:19.160
Before you get the,
you need to know something.

04:19.235 --> 04:20.303
There was
an assassination attempt

04:20.334 --> 04:21.432
on President Palmer.

04:21.507 --> 04:22.860
He was wounded,
but we don't know

04:22.937 --> 04:24.172
the extent of his injuries yet.

04:24.206 --> 04:25.102
Oh, my God.

04:25.168 --> 04:27.231
How did this happen?

04:27.306 --> 04:29.962
Details are still coming in.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.300
Secret Service
thinks it was Assad.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.600
What?

04:32.666 --> 04:34.303
They think he smuggled
some kind of explosive device

04:34.405 --> 04:35.601
into the White House bunker.

04:35.667 --> 04:36.963
Bill, that doesn't
make sense.

04:37.035 --> 04:39.560
Assad was working with the
President to stop Fayed.

04:39.638 --> 04:41.632
That's what he said
he was doing.
He wasn't lying.

04:41.705 --> 04:43.330
He's dead, Jack.

04:43.405 --> 04:44.961
Doesn't matter if
it was him or not.

04:45.037 --> 04:47.101
He can't help
us stop Fayed.

04:47.167 --> 04:49.062
Which means you're following
our only live lead.

04:49.135 --> 04:50.633
I understand.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.782
I'll get back to you as soon
as I'm at the Consulate.

04:52.835 --> 04:53.761
All right.

04:53.836 --> 04:54.933
What happened?

04:57.038 --> 04:58.002
There was an
assassination attempt

04:58.035 --> 04:59.501
on Wayne Palmer.

05:03.706 --> 05:05.661
(steady beeping)

05:31.437 --> 05:32.401
Excuse me,
Mr. Pollock.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.400
(clears throat):
Yes. What do you want?

05:34.468 --> 05:35.672
The Vice President
is being tele-briefed

05:35.708 --> 05:36.632
in the conference room.

05:36.707 --> 05:39.501
The SecDef wants
Mr. Lennox there.

05:39.566 --> 05:41.661
Well, Mr. Lennox is occupied.

05:41.736 --> 05:44.202
I'm covering
for him.

05:44.268 --> 05:46.800
KANIN:
Dr. Welton is monitoring
the medical team,

05:46.868 --> 05:48.431
so I've asked him
to brief us directly

05:48.506 --> 05:51.132
on the President's condition.

05:51.207 --> 05:52.130
Mr. Vice President.

05:52.206 --> 05:53.860
Go ahead.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.102
We're still trying to stabilize

05:55.136 --> 05:56.102
President Palmer.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.560
He was hit by shrapnel,

05:57.635 --> 05:59.431
which entered
his upper chest and neck.

05:59.505 --> 06:01.662
He didn't suffer
any direct head wounds,

06:01.735 --> 06:03.133
but he is unconscious.

06:03.205 --> 06:05.203
Can you determine when he might
be able to resume

06:05.266 --> 06:06.930
his presidential duties?

06:07.008 --> 06:08.480
Sir, the President
was within ten feet

06:08.508 --> 06:10.702
of a high-velocity
explosive device.

06:10.766 --> 06:13.730
That he survived at all is...

06:13.808 --> 06:14.763
a miracle.

06:16.838 --> 06:18.100
KANIN:
Mr. Vice President,

06:18.166 --> 06:21.230
as Secretary of Defense,
I'm the ranking member

06:21.300 --> 06:22.660
of this committee.

06:22.732 --> 06:26.209
And I think I can speak
for all of us when I say

06:26.269 --> 06:28.838
we have no way
of knowing when

06:28.909 --> 06:32.900
<i>or if</i> the President
will recover enough to function.

06:32.965 --> 06:36.903
We need to proceed
under the assumption

06:36.968 --> 06:41.103
that the President's duties
are now yours.

06:54.607 --> 06:56.301
I'm going to be landing
in a few minutes.

06:56.366 --> 06:57.600
As soon as I get there,

06:57.666 --> 07:00.263
I want a full security briefing
from Tom Lennox.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.563
Yes, sir.

07:02.638 --> 07:03.761
We'll see you here soon.

07:09.908 --> 07:12.731
Please submit your task profiles
to my office.

07:12.806 --> 07:15.502
We'll reconvene when the
Vice President gets here.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.133
Reed.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.660
Where the hell is Tom Lennox?

07:22.738 --> 07:24.701
I believe that he's conferencing
with the Attorney General.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.101
I just spoke with the A.G.

07:26.168 --> 07:27.463
He's had no contact with him.

07:27.536 --> 07:28.733
Hmm.

07:28.806 --> 07:30.302
Well, then I'm not sure.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.761
You work for the man,
you don't know where he is?

07:32.836 --> 07:35.332
President Palmer,
uh, was expecting him

07:35.405 --> 07:38.603
in the broadcast studio,
and he didn't show up.

07:42.868 --> 07:44.600
Tom Lennox is missing.

07:44.668 --> 07:46.001
Have your team
sweep the bunker.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.003
Find him.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.431
Yes, sir.

07:48.505 --> 07:49.430
Need a ten-twenty

07:49.507 --> 07:50.532
on Tom Lennox.

07:50.608 --> 07:52.561
This is a priority
request from the SecDef.

08:03.867 --> 08:05.932
You had the clarity
to understand

08:06.008 --> 08:07.160
how to keep this
country safe.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.661
But the President
was an obstacle.

08:09.737 --> 08:11.701
We did what was
necessary.

08:15.068 --> 08:17.231
Is he dead?

08:19.865 --> 08:21.903
No.

08:21.966 --> 08:23.400
But he's injured badly enough

08:23.465 --> 08:25.163
that he won't
be able to serve.

08:25.237 --> 08:26.162
Secret Service

08:26.236 --> 08:27.430
is looking for Lennox.

08:27.505 --> 08:28.733
They're sweeping the bunker.

08:28.805 --> 08:30.373
Let me handle him while
there's still time.

08:30.405 --> 08:31.362
No.

08:31.436 --> 08:32.701
Look, I told
you before,

08:32.767 --> 08:34.080
I can make it
look like a suicide.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.003
The situation
will support it.

08:37.065 --> 08:38.933
He was depressed after the
President rejected his plan.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.332
No. We cannot kill Tom Lennox.

08:40.407 --> 08:41.801
Why not?

08:41.866 --> 08:44.530
Because we're not murderers.

08:44.605 --> 08:48.930
What we did was necessary for
the sake of national security.

08:49.008 --> 08:53.100
Killing Lennox is just about us
trying to cover our involvement.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.403
Getting caught--

08:55.468 --> 08:56.663
never part of the plan.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.162
Don't touch him.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.532
Or what?

09:00.607 --> 09:03.531
Or you'll have to kill me, too.

09:05.607 --> 09:09.503
Listen, I know
Tom Lennox.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.032
He can be reasoned with.

09:30.206 --> 09:31.600
So you really did it.

09:31.665 --> 09:33.931
Only because it had to be done.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.063
You were the one
who warned us all

09:36.136 --> 09:38.930
that the logic
of this current engagement

09:39.005 --> 09:40.803
would demand extreme action.

09:40.868 --> 09:43.233
You said that for
the greater good,

09:43.308 --> 09:45.202
individuals would
need to be sacrificed.

09:45.267 --> 09:47.360
I wasn't referring
to the President

09:47.438 --> 09:48.860
of the United
States.

09:48.936 --> 09:52.463
Sir, the President's policies
would have aided the enemy.

09:52.537 --> 09:54.661
They may have been
well-intentioned,

09:54.735 --> 09:56.830
but they were naïve,
and they were dangerous,

09:56.906 --> 09:58.401
and you know that.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.060
Vice President Daniels
is running this country now.

10:03.137 --> 10:06.561
He will implement
your security plan.

10:06.637 --> 10:10.232
But if you implicate us,
it will only drag you into this.

10:10.306 --> 10:12.203
And it will make
your security plan

10:12.265 --> 10:13.601
that much harder
to push through.

10:13.665 --> 10:15.803
I'm the one who tried
to stop you, Reed.

10:15.867 --> 10:19.100
They'll never believe you.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.702
Sir, the only way

10:22.766 --> 10:24.201
to stop these
nuclear weapons

10:24.268 --> 10:25.663
from being detonated
on U.S. soil

10:25.738 --> 10:29.330
is through the proposals
in your security plan.

10:29.406 --> 10:31.861
And all I have to do
is do nothing.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.302
Yes.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.160
Carson has matched
the bomb signature

10:36.237 --> 10:37.662
to a design

10:37.738 --> 10:40.302
used by Assad's
organization.

10:40.367 --> 10:43.200
The FBI will put this
all on Assad.

10:45.305 --> 10:48.261
No one needs to
know the truth.

10:48.335 --> 10:49.933
I'll know.

10:50.005 --> 10:52.930
Sir, a guilty conscience
is a fair price to pay

10:53.008 --> 10:55.260
for the survival
of this country.

10:57.536 --> 10:59.732
(whispers):
They're coming.

10:59.806 --> 11:03.260
Do you understand
the situation, sir?

11:03.338 --> 11:05.360
I do understand, Reed.

11:05.437 --> 11:07.031
I know that you will
do the right thing.

11:09.906 --> 11:10.961
Good.

11:12.707 --> 11:14.663
I'm gonna cut him loose.

11:17.406 --> 11:19.360
(grunts)

11:29.405 --> 11:34.130
Mr.Lennox,
are you all right?

11:34.206 --> 11:35.360
Yes, Agent Lowry.

11:35.438 --> 11:37.002
Sir, the secretary of defense

11:37.065 --> 11:39.701
has been
looking for you.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.631
Agent Lowry,
these men are responsible

11:47.705 --> 11:49.570
for the attempted assassination
of the president.

11:49.605 --> 11:51.600
I'm surrendering myself

11:51.666 --> 11:53.701
into custody till
I can talk to the
attorney general,

12:13.535 --> 12:15.463
--WOMAN:
Welcome back, sir.

12:15.536 --> 12:16.732
Thank you, Lisa.

12:16.806 --> 12:18.400
I've sifted through
the latest flashes.

12:18.466 --> 12:19.663
These are the ones

12:19.736 --> 12:21.162
you need
to take a look at.

12:21.238 --> 12:22.633
I went over
everything on
the plane.

12:22.706 --> 12:24.731
I want to follow up
on the one from CTU.

12:24.805 --> 12:26.801
I'll get them
on the line.

12:28.608 --> 12:32.063
I have the Vice President
calling for Mr. Buchanan.

12:34.568 --> 12:35.832
(two beeps)

12:35.905 --> 12:37.601
MAN:
Mr. Buchanan,
I have the Vice President

12:37.666 --> 12:39.201
for you on line two.

12:39.267 --> 12:40.532
This is Bill Buchanan.

12:40.607 --> 12:42.060
LISA:
Sir, one moment

12:42.137 --> 12:44.100
for the Vice
President.

12:46.207 --> 12:48.330
Bill, I see
from the White House flashes

12:48.408 --> 12:50.803
that President
Palmer granted
Charles Logan

12:50.866 --> 12:52.161
some kind
of furlough.

12:52.237 --> 12:55.533
I'm curious as to
what circumstances

12:55.606 --> 12:57.001
could possibly
have led to that?

12:57.065 --> 12:59.203
Logan claims he
can help us find
Dmitri Gredenko,

12:59.266 --> 13:00.663
the man who supplied
the terrorists

13:00.737 --> 13:02.031
with the suitcase
nukes, sir.

13:02.108 --> 13:03.203
How?

13:03.266 --> 13:05.161
Through the Russian Consul
in Los Angeles.

13:05.237 --> 13:07.661
Logan believes this man
will know how to find Gredenko,

13:07.735 --> 13:09.962
but he insisted on approaching
the consul in person.

13:10.038 --> 13:11.232
I'm frankly surprised

13:11.307 --> 13:13.003
President Palmer
trusted Charles Logan

13:13.066 --> 13:15.061
to conduct any business
on the government's behalf.

13:15.138 --> 13:17.600
I believe the president's
decision was informed

13:17.666 --> 13:20.532
by the fact that we have no
other active leads on Gredenko.

13:20.607 --> 13:22.100
Is Logan being supervised?

13:22.167 --> 13:23.761
Yes, by one of our agents,

13:23.837 --> 13:25.101
Jack Bauer.

13:25.165 --> 13:27.230
Bauer's been instructed
to keep Logan on a short leash.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.062
You keep me posted
to any progress.

13:29.138 --> 13:31.633
And as soon as
this plays out,

13:31.706 --> 13:33.263
I want him back
under house arrest.

13:33.337 --> 13:34.463
Yes, sir.

13:36.765 --> 13:39.733
You can come with me
into the consulate,

13:39.806 --> 13:41.733
but I need to speak
to Markov alone.

13:41.805 --> 13:43.400
You don't leave my sight.

13:43.465 --> 13:45.101
Then this is a
waste of time.

13:45.168 --> 13:47.500
Markov won't tell us
what we need to know
if you're in the room.

13:47.537 --> 13:48.863
I don't let you
out of my sight.

13:48.937 --> 13:50.532
What do you think
I'm gonna do in there,

13:50.606 --> 13:51.701
Jack, request asylum?

13:51.766 --> 13:53.362
If it's
any comfort,

13:53.436 --> 13:56.163
I don't think the
Russians would take me.

13:58.107 --> 14:00.530
Fine.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.531
You can talk to the consul

14:02.608 --> 14:04.961
on your own, but I will be
right outside the door.

14:05.035 --> 14:07.533
You try and move more
than 20 feet away from me,

14:07.606 --> 14:09.860
and I will know.

14:09.938 --> 14:11.561
I'm gonna prove

14:11.636 --> 14:12.731
you wrong, Jack.

14:12.806 --> 14:16.031
I'm only trying to help.

14:22.066 --> 14:24.032
The Consul is expecting you,
Mr. President.

14:24.106 --> 14:26.061
Follow me, please.

14:34.365 --> 14:35.700
(knocking)

14:35.766 --> 14:37.232
Mr. President.
Anatoly.

14:37.307 --> 14:39.602
It's good
to see you.
It's a pleasure, sir.

14:39.668 --> 14:41.763
How have you been?

14:41.837 --> 14:43.362
Very well.

14:43.436 --> 14:45.561
Still trying to do my best
for my country.

14:45.637 --> 14:46.832
As much

14:46.908 --> 14:48.700
as circumstances
will allow, of course.

14:48.767 --> 14:52.003
Of course.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.861
My sincere sympathies
to your people

14:53.936 --> 14:56.003
for the tragedy
this morning.

14:56.068 --> 14:58.461
You have, uh,
condolences

14:58.538 --> 15:00.932
and support
of my country.

15:01.007 --> 15:02.533
Thank you.

15:02.607 --> 15:05.230
Now...

15:05.307 --> 15:08.261
how can I help you?

15:10.406 --> 15:12.263
The bomb that exploded
this morning

15:12.336 --> 15:14.202
was a Russian suitcase
nuclear device

15:14.268 --> 15:17.962
supplied to the terrorists
by Dmitri Gredenko.

15:20.207 --> 15:22.163
(heavy sigh)

15:23.465 --> 15:27.561
No, thank you.
I don't smoke anymore.

15:29.866 --> 15:32.102
(clipping with scissors)

15:32.168 --> 15:35.361
(sighs)

15:35.438 --> 15:36.930
Mr. President,

15:37.005 --> 15:38.931
those weapons
were destroyed

15:39.006 --> 15:40.803
as part of
our treaty.

15:40.865 --> 15:43.702
We're certain
of our facts, Anatoly,

15:43.766 --> 15:46.461
but I didn't come here
to make accusations.

15:46.537 --> 15:49.761
I came here because we need
to know where Gredenko is.

15:49.836 --> 15:51.761
(inhales deeply)

15:51.837 --> 15:53.830
I will ask Moscow

15:53.906 --> 15:56.560
to try to locate him
immediately.

15:56.636 --> 15:59.063
I'm not asking Moscow,
I'm asking you.

16:01.138 --> 16:03.162
I know that you
two close are close,

16:03.237 --> 16:05.532
and you have been ever
since you fought together

16:05.607 --> 16:09.432
in Afghanistan, so...

16:09.507 --> 16:10.662
I ask again.

16:10.735 --> 16:12.860
Where is he?

16:12.937 --> 16:15.101
I don't know.

16:15.166 --> 16:20.402
Dmitri and I were close
for many years,

16:20.466 --> 16:21.832
but not now.

16:21.906 --> 16:25.002
Forgive my lack of diplomacy,
but I don't believe you,

16:25.068 --> 16:28.960
and I'm willing
to force the issue.

16:29.036 --> 16:32.460
Moscow has always suspected
that someone inside

16:32.537 --> 16:35.060
the Russian government
helped supply

16:35.137 --> 16:36.331
the Sentox nerve gas

16:36.407 --> 16:38.033
to the separatists
two years ago.

16:40.206 --> 16:42.563
I have the tapes, Anatoly,

16:42.638 --> 16:45.031
of every phone call
you made to my people.

16:45.106 --> 16:47.803
I will send them
to President Suvarov.

16:49.468 --> 16:54.560
You gave me your word that
my role would remain secret.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.031
My promise is rendered

16:56.105 --> 16:58.100
null and void by the fact

16:58.166 --> 17:01.400
that the terrorists that
Gredenko was helping have

17:01.466 --> 17:02.831
three more bombs.

17:02.906 --> 17:06.001
I haven't spoken to Gredenko
for more than one year.

17:06.068 --> 17:09.432
I will send the tapes,
you'll be recalled to Moscow,

17:09.507 --> 17:11.601
and you will never
be heard of again.

17:11.666 --> 17:15.303
You can send
all the tapes you like...

17:17.165 --> 17:19.261
...destroy me many times over.

17:19.336 --> 17:20.502
I do not know

17:20.568 --> 17:22.561
where Gredenko is!

17:30.237 --> 17:31.763
All right, Anatoly.

17:31.838 --> 17:33.063
I believe you.

17:33.135 --> 17:37.201
Please forgive
my tactics.

17:37.266 --> 17:40.330
I'm trying
to save people's lives.

17:45.035 --> 17:48.361
So... if you know anyone else

17:48.435 --> 17:51.330
who might still be in contact
with Gredenko...

17:57.508 --> 17:59.461
I will make calls.

18:01.708 --> 18:03.403
But as far as I know,

18:03.468 --> 18:07.732
everyone else has cut off
contact with Dmitri, as well.

18:07.807 --> 18:10.363
Any support will be
greatly appreciated.

18:10.438 --> 18:11.600
Of course.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.863
Anatoly.

18:13.936 --> 18:16.232
Mr. President.

18:29.705 --> 18:31.662
(sighs)

18:36.967 --> 18:39.530
He says he hasn't spoken
to Gredenko in a year.

18:39.605 --> 18:40.801
He's lying.

18:40.868 --> 18:42.802
They're still in contact,

18:42.866 --> 18:46.663
and he knows enough about what's
going on to want to deny that.

18:46.737 --> 18:48.433
How do you know?

18:48.505 --> 18:50.361
Because I've done
enough lying myself

18:50.436 --> 18:52.261
to be familiar
with the signs.

18:58.435 --> 19:00.432
(phone ringing)

19:00.505 --> 19:01.761
Yes?

19:01.838 --> 19:04.301
MARKOV:
United States has connected you
with terrorists.

19:04.365 --> 19:05.760
Are you sure?

19:05.838 --> 19:08.130
They sent Charles Logan
to try and cause me

19:08.206 --> 19:09.431
to give up your location.

19:09.507 --> 19:10.861
The reason

19:10.938 --> 19:14.462
we brought the Arabs into this
was to conceal our involvement.

19:14.608 --> 19:16.003
Now we're exposed.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.630
Russia is exposed.

19:17.705 --> 19:20.203
The Americans are speculating.

19:20.268 --> 19:21.561
They have no evidence.

19:21.637 --> 19:23.661
If they did,
they wouldn't have sent Logan.

19:23.736 --> 19:25.662
(sighs):
I don't know.

19:25.738 --> 19:27.703
Don't worry, Dmitri.

19:27.768 --> 19:29.702
By the time
they find anything,

19:29.766 --> 19:31.232
it will be
too late.

19:31.305 --> 19:33.061
All right.

19:33.138 --> 19:35.532
Let me know
if you hear anything more.

19:44.237 --> 19:45.502
Drive through
the front gates.

19:45.568 --> 19:47.902
Pull over as soon as you're out
of sight of the guards.

19:47.965 --> 19:49.202
What are you going to do?

19:50.636 --> 19:52.600
(phone ringing)

19:52.666 --> 19:54.401
O'Brian.

19:54.465 --> 19:55.603
Chloe, it's Jack.

19:55.668 --> 19:58.201
I need you to gain access
to the DWP server.

19:58.266 --> 20:00.233
I want you to
disable the
power going

20:00.307 --> 20:02.832
to the Russian
Consulate as soon
as you can. Chloe,

20:02.908 --> 20:04.333
you need to do this
under the radar.

20:04.406 --> 20:07.161
How long do you need
the power out for?

20:07.235 --> 20:09.303
60 seconds. Make it look
like a grid failure

20:09.366 --> 20:11.502
in case the consulate tries
to contact the DWP.

20:11.568 --> 20:13.563
I'll get back to you
when I'm ready.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.503
Are you going
back in there?

20:19.237 --> 20:22.030
Jack, you just spent nearly
two years in a Chinese prison

20:22.108 --> 20:24.233
because you violated the
sovereignty of their consulate.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.933
Now you plan to go back
into the Russian consulate

20:27.006 --> 20:29.700
and take a chance
on that happening again?!

20:41.467 --> 20:43.863
--REPORTER:
As nightfall approaches
in the Pacific time zone,

20:43.937 --> 20:47.233
Hazmat teams and emergency crews
in Valencia, California,

20:47.306 --> 20:49.400
continue to search
for survivors,

20:49.466 --> 20:53.963
while the official death toll
stands at just over 12,000.

20:54.038 --> 20:55.100
(phone rings)

20:55.167 --> 20:56.262
And the number is rising...

20:56.336 --> 20:57.432
Hi.

20:57.508 --> 20:58.260
Where are you?

20:58.337 --> 21:00.030
I'm still at the airport.

21:00.107 --> 21:01.231
Waiting for my plane. Why?

21:01.308 --> 21:02.301
What's up?

21:02.367 --> 21:03.363
About a half hour ago

21:03.438 --> 21:04.460
there was an attempt made

21:04.538 --> 21:06.100
on President
Palmer's life.
What?

21:06.165 --> 21:08.560
They won't know the full
extent of his injuries

21:08.638 --> 21:10.303
until he regains
consciousness.

21:10.368 --> 21:12.961
There's been nothing

21:13.038 --> 21:14.002
of this on the news.

21:14.066 --> 21:15.183
Hasn't been made public yet.

21:17.105 --> 21:18.303
The Vice President's
on his way

21:18.335 --> 21:19.400
back to the White House.

21:19.465 --> 21:21.161
He's already assumed
executive duties.

21:23.236 --> 21:25.631
I have to go back.

21:25.707 --> 21:27.500
You think Daniels
will have you back?

21:27.566 --> 21:28.800
You've already tendered
your resignation.

21:28.836 --> 21:30.330
Nothing's been processed.

21:30.408 --> 21:32.002
Technically, I can withdraw

21:32.066 --> 21:33.261
my resignation.

21:33.337 --> 21:35.603
I've gotta go back, Bill.

21:35.668 --> 21:38.332
Look, I'll call you
when I get there, okay?

21:38.406 --> 21:40.633
All right.

21:41.768 --> 21:42.832
Once we're settled in,

21:42.905 --> 21:44.461
I want to go over
an annotated copy

21:44.536 --> 21:45.661
of the Lennox proposal.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.562
I'll need you to work up
a distribution list.

21:54.035 --> 21:56.200
The President rejected
that plan.

21:57.335 --> 22:00.031
What's your point?

22:00.106 --> 22:03.700
Don't you think it might be a
little too soon to enact it?

22:03.767 --> 22:05.101
(sighs)

22:05.165 --> 22:08.902
Lisa, a Muslim terrorist
just set off a bomb

22:08.966 --> 22:11.033
inside the White House.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.860
If anything, we've delayed this
far too long.

22:20.108 --> 22:22.063
Mr. Vice President.

22:22.137 --> 22:23.233
Hello, Ethan.

22:23.305 --> 22:25.630
What's the President's
condition?

22:25.707 --> 22:27.633
Well, they've managed
to stabilize him.

22:27.708 --> 22:31.031
But it's still too soon
to make a prognosis.

22:33.108 --> 22:35.132
Something else has come up.

22:40.236 --> 22:42.932
There's been a development
in the investigation

22:43.008 --> 22:45.101
of the assassination
attempt.

22:45.167 --> 22:48.961
Tom Lennox has remanded
himself into custody.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.260
Lennox?

22:52.335 --> 22:54.831
What are you talking about?

22:55.967 --> 22:57.561
Oh, just about two hours ago.

22:57.635 --> 22:59.033
That's when Reed
first hinted

22:59.105 --> 23:00.700
that there was a plot
against the President.

23:00.735 --> 23:03.701
But you waited an hour before
you tried to report it.

23:03.765 --> 23:05.330
Because there was nothing

23:05.405 --> 23:08.032
actionable that...
just all innuendo.

23:08.105 --> 23:10.163
I was simply trying to
wait and find out more.

23:10.237 --> 23:12.403
By the time I realized they
were making their move,

23:12.467 --> 23:15.502
Reed caught me trying
to alert Agent Hollister.

23:15.565 --> 23:17.630
That's when he struck you
over the head and tied you up.

23:17.667 --> 23:18.900
That's correct.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.903
So when you provided
Bruce Carson's clearance

23:20.965 --> 23:22.432
into the White House...
Wait, no, no.

23:22.507 --> 23:24.431
No, I didn't provide
anybody clearance.

23:24.508 --> 23:26.703
Reed stole my
clearance card.

23:26.767 --> 23:28.431
And gave these men the
President's classified

23:28.466 --> 23:30.760
itinerary,
you were just pretending.

23:30.835 --> 23:32.431
Yes.

23:34.506 --> 23:37.701
Or maybe it's just that you
had second thoughts?

23:37.768 --> 23:39.430
(sighs)
(door opens)

23:44.605 --> 23:47.433
I would like to speak to
Mr. Lennox alone, please.

23:47.505 --> 23:49.460
Yes, sir.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.833
I tried to stop this, Noah.

24:02.906 --> 24:05.461
I'd like to believe you, Tom.

24:05.537 --> 24:07.633
But I'll leave it

24:07.706 --> 24:09.903
to the Justice Department to
determine your role in this.

24:09.937 --> 24:11.100
As well as Assad's.

24:11.167 --> 24:12.161
Assad?

24:12.237 --> 24:13.331
They were setting him up.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.761
He had nothing to do with this.

24:14.835 --> 24:16.561
You don't know that.

24:16.636 --> 24:18.630
It's my understanding,

24:18.708 --> 24:22.561
you suggested that others
besides Reed and this man

24:22.636 --> 24:24.000
Carson may have been involved.

24:24.065 --> 24:26.131
Only because Reed
implied as much.

24:26.206 --> 24:28.762
I was just trying to ferret out
who else might be involved.

24:28.837 --> 24:29.901
And did you?

24:29.965 --> 24:31.801
No.

24:31.866 --> 24:33.262
Then it is conceivable

24:33.337 --> 24:36.300
that Assad may have been,
at the very least,

24:36.368 --> 24:37.801
a willing participant
in this attack.

24:37.868 --> 24:40.800
That makes no sense whatsoever.

24:40.866 --> 24:42.600
Assad was a terrorist

24:42.667 --> 24:43.803
who hated this country

24:43.865 --> 24:45.260
and everything
it stands for.

24:45.336 --> 24:47.360
What better way for him
to rally his people

24:47.437 --> 24:48.861
than to martyr himself

24:48.937 --> 24:50.530
by murdering the President
of the United States.

24:50.568 --> 24:51.962
Don't you understand
that is exactly

24:52.038 --> 24:55.461
what Reed and Carson wanted this
to look like and now

24:55.537 --> 24:56.692
you're playing right into it.

24:56.705 --> 25:00.233
I am going to address
the nation shortly,

25:00.306 --> 25:01.773
to inform the public
about what's happened.

25:01.805 --> 25:03.962
Until I have
all the facts,

25:04.037 --> 25:06.131
I am not about to tell them

25:06.207 --> 25:08.461
that Hamri Al-Assad is innocent
in this.

25:14.135 --> 25:16.403
I see what you're doing
here, Noah.

25:19.806 --> 25:21.502
By scapegoating Assad,

25:21.568 --> 25:23.202
you'll be able to reverse
the President's agenda.

25:23.235 --> 25:26.201
Get even more aggressive
with the Islamic community.

25:26.265 --> 25:27.901
You think I don't see
what you're doing here?

25:27.938 --> 25:29.303
It's your plan, Tom.

25:29.365 --> 25:31.862
You outlined those
measures yourself.

25:31.937 --> 25:33.602
I was your staunchest advocate.

25:37.935 --> 25:41.232
What has happened
to the President

25:41.306 --> 25:43.262
is horrific.

25:45.107 --> 25:47.701
But if there is any good
to come from this,

25:47.765 --> 25:50.400
it's that we now have
the opportunity

25:50.468 --> 25:51.863
to do what we both know is

25:51.936 --> 25:53.531
in the best interests of
protecting this country.

25:53.566 --> 25:57.003
You're asking a whole heck
of a lot more

25:57.066 --> 25:59.503
than for me just to maintain
silence on Assad.

25:59.567 --> 26:03.601
The Cabinet knows that you are
the architect of the plan.

26:03.667 --> 26:05.462
If you're not on
the face of it now,

26:05.537 --> 26:07.230
it may raise questions.

26:07.307 --> 26:09.381
Or have you come to believe
the President was correct

26:09.437 --> 26:10.553
in rejecting your proposals?

26:10.607 --> 26:12.103
No.

26:12.166 --> 26:15.432
I-I know it's, it's the only way
to stop these attacks.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.231
Then you can stick
to your assertion

26:17.306 --> 26:19.262
of Assad's complete innocence.

26:19.336 --> 26:22.463
Or I can clear you
of these charges

26:22.536 --> 26:24.930
and you can help me
to initiate your plan,

26:25.008 --> 26:27.800
which we both know is

26:27.865 --> 26:30.430
in the best interest
of the country.

26:44.206 --> 26:46.162
Agent Lowry.

26:50.605 --> 26:52.961
I don't want Mr. Lennox's
statement promoted

26:53.038 --> 26:55.401
to the Attorney General until
it's gone through my office.

26:55.466 --> 26:57.560
Yes, sir.

27:27.137 --> 27:30.131
* *

27:34.335 --> 27:35.533
(speaking Russian)

27:45.568 --> 27:47.561
(buzzing)

27:50.866 --> 27:52.800
Have you got it?

27:52.865 --> 27:54.531
Yeah, I've logged
onto the DWP Server.

27:54.605 --> 27:55.833
You have a 60 second window

27:55.905 --> 27:58.563
before the building's circuits
kick back in.

27:58.636 --> 28:01.003
Hold on.

28:08.106 --> 28:09.201
Shut it down now.

28:13.708 --> 28:16.632
(beeping)

28:16.706 --> 28:17.661
What is happening?

28:17.735 --> 28:18.732
I don't know.

28:18.805 --> 28:20.301
Something's wrong.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.402
You check the upper level,
I check the lower level.

28:22.468 --> 28:23.663
Got it.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.260
(speaking Russian)

28:31.267 --> 28:32.833
What is this?

28:32.907 --> 28:34.303
Put your hands
where I can see them.

28:34.337 --> 28:35.800
I don't know what he's doing,
sending you here.

28:35.838 --> 28:36.760
Where's Gredenko?

28:36.837 --> 28:38.031
I told him
I don't know.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.403
We know you're lying.

28:39.466 --> 28:41.232
Get you hands away
from the desk now!

28:41.306 --> 28:42.700
Sit down!

28:44.236 --> 28:45.550
You're breaking
international law.

28:45.607 --> 28:47.502
Violating sovereignty

28:47.568 --> 28:48.661
of the Consulate.

28:48.738 --> 28:50.661
I don't have time
to ask nicely.

28:50.738 --> 28:52.031
Where's Gredenko?

28:52.105 --> 28:53.930
I-I don't know, I swear.

28:56.005 --> 28:57.360
(speaking Russian)

28:57.435 --> 28:59.460
I'm not sure
what's happening.

28:59.535 --> 29:00.932
When the power
came back on,

29:01.008 --> 29:03.200
the Consul's panic button
was triggered.

29:05.007 --> 29:05.801
(knocking on door)

29:06.835 --> 29:08.731
Consul Markov?

29:08.807 --> 29:09.901
Are you all right?

29:09.967 --> 29:11.230
I've taken the
Consul hostage

29:11.308 --> 29:12.303
at gunpoint.

29:12.367 --> 29:13.362
If you make any attempt

29:13.438 --> 29:15.003
to enter this room,
I will kill him.

29:15.068 --> 29:16.132
Do you understand me?

29:16.208 --> 29:19.360
Find out who this man is
and alert Moscow.

29:19.436 --> 29:20.861
(speaking Russian)

29:28.906 --> 29:31.631
This is Jack,
let me speak to Buchanan.

29:31.705 --> 29:34.562
MAN:
Jack Bauer on line one.

29:34.636 --> 29:36.301
What's going on, Jack?

29:36.365 --> 29:37.602
Bill, I got a situation.

29:37.665 --> 29:39.130
Logan's play didn't work.

29:39.205 --> 29:40.561
So I came back
to the Consulate

29:40.637 --> 29:41.760
to talk to Markov myself.

29:41.836 --> 29:43.430
Before I could get any
information from him,

29:43.467 --> 29:45.133
I was discovered.

29:45.205 --> 29:46.403
I've barricaded myself
in his office,

29:46.438 --> 29:48.432
but I don't know how much
more time I've got.

29:48.508 --> 29:50.672
It's Russian territory I can't
sanction what you're doing.

29:50.705 --> 29:51.902
I know, Bill.

29:51.966 --> 29:53.333
I'm calling because you need
to call the White House

29:53.366 --> 29:54.331
and advise them.

29:54.405 --> 29:55.401
I want you

29:55.467 --> 29:56.762
to stand down,
find a way out.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.302
I'm not going anywhere
until Markov tells me

29:58.338 --> 29:59.661
how to find Gredenko.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.063
--Mr. Vice President.

30:43.138 --> 30:44.461
The Press Secretary

30:44.537 --> 30:46.063
is set up
for your televised address.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.060
You'll be going live

30:47.138 --> 30:48.251
in approximately
ten minutes.

30:48.308 --> 30:50.000
(clearing throat):
Thank you, Lisa.

30:50.066 --> 30:52.463
Have you finished drafting
my statement?

30:52.536 --> 30:55.902
I'll have it for
you momentarily.

30:55.965 --> 30:58.361
I thought you should know I
just received word Karen Hayes

30:58.437 --> 30:59.932
has withdrawn
her resignation.

31:00.005 --> 31:02.261
She's on her
way here now.

31:02.337 --> 31:03.903
Do we know what prompted
her resignation

31:03.968 --> 31:05.463
in the first place?

31:05.536 --> 31:07.463
Officially, it was to
return to Los Angeles

31:07.535 --> 31:09.400
to be with her husband,

31:09.465 --> 31:11.062
but rumor has it
she stepped down

31:11.135 --> 31:13.160
because of her opposition
to the Lennox Plan.

31:14.338 --> 31:15.532
I see.

31:15.605 --> 31:16.963
CTU OPERATOR:
Mr. Vice President,

31:17.036 --> 31:19.402
I have Bill Buchanan
on the line.

31:19.465 --> 31:21.260
This is the Vice President.

31:21.336 --> 31:24.432
Sir, a situation has developed
at the Russian Consulate.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.600
What kind of situation?

31:26.667 --> 31:29.463
Jack Bauer has taken
Russian Consul Markov hostage.

31:29.538 --> 31:31.132
He's holding him at gunpoint
inside the Consulate.

31:31.168 --> 31:33.063
What?

31:33.138 --> 31:34.163
How could that happen?

31:34.238 --> 31:36.830
Markov denied having
any contact with Gredenko,

31:36.908 --> 31:39.400
but Logan insisted
he was lying.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.831
When the escort left
the Consulate,

31:40.908 --> 31:42.330
Bauer went back
to question Markov.

31:42.408 --> 31:44.663
That's when
he was discovered.

31:44.738 --> 31:46.663
My God.

31:49.538 --> 31:50.462
Did you approve

31:50.538 --> 31:52.203
these actions?
No, sir.

31:52.265 --> 31:54.063
Bauer acted
on his own authority.

31:54.136 --> 31:56.961
And the questionable assumption
of Charles Logan.

31:57.038 --> 32:00.630
Sir, Bauer has absolutely no
reason to trust Charles Logan.

32:00.705 --> 32:02.033
(phone ringing)

32:02.108 --> 32:04.502
Yet he was convinced enough
to take the action that he did.

32:04.566 --> 32:06.631
In any event, he's created
a diplomatic mess.

32:06.706 --> 32:09.232
If Markov has information that
could lead us to Gredenko...
Yes.

32:09.305 --> 32:11.002
...then extracting
it is our only chance

32:11.066 --> 32:12.962
to stop the next nuke
from being detonated.

32:13.037 --> 32:15.000
Excuse me, sir.

32:15.065 --> 32:17.730
Not now, Lisa.
Sir, it's President Suvarov.

32:17.806 --> 32:20.963
(sighs)

32:21.035 --> 32:23.160
(clears throat)

32:23.236 --> 32:26.662
Bill, I don't know how long
I can hold off the Russians.

32:26.735 --> 32:28.171
If Markov is connected
to these nukes,

32:28.208 --> 32:30.002
Bauer had better get
it out of him fast.

32:30.068 --> 32:31.030
Yes, sir.

32:38.468 --> 32:40.960
(sighs)

32:42.008 --> 32:44.662
Mr. President,

32:44.737 --> 32:46.830
this is Vice President Daniels.

32:46.907 --> 32:49.233
I was expecting to speak
to President Palmer.

32:49.308 --> 32:50.233
My apologies.

32:50.305 --> 32:52.532
I'm afraid he's
unavailable.

32:52.608 --> 32:53.703
Unavailable?

32:53.768 --> 32:56.433
Sir, I'm speaking
on his authority.

32:56.505 --> 32:57.532
I assume that you're calling

32:57.566 --> 33:00.061
about the incident
at your Consulate.

33:00.136 --> 33:02.231
Let me assure you
this man is acting

33:02.305 --> 33:04.632
on his own and not
under the orders or authority

33:04.708 --> 33:06.163
of the United
States government.

33:06.238 --> 33:09.700
Nevertheless, this is a gross
violation of our sovereignty.

33:09.765 --> 33:12.463
If your agent
does not stand down immediately,

33:12.535 --> 33:15.863
my country will have no choice
but to retaliate

33:15.935 --> 33:17.862
with the most forceful
diplomatic measures

33:17.938 --> 33:19.332
at our disposal.

33:19.408 --> 33:21.361
I understand your position,
Mr. President,

33:21.435 --> 33:24.531
but before you escalate this,
you should understand mine.

33:24.608 --> 33:27.602
We have learned that
Consul Markov is most likely

33:27.665 --> 33:29.962
in contact with Dmitri Gredenko,
who we've linked

33:30.036 --> 33:33.500
to the nuclear attack that took
place on U.S. soil this morning.

33:33.567 --> 33:37.233
If that's true, we will look
upon him as a coconspirator

33:37.308 --> 33:39.633
in the attack.

33:39.707 --> 33:44.133
Mr. Vice President,
I deeply regret the tragedy

33:44.208 --> 33:45.902
that your country
has experienced today,

33:45.966 --> 33:47.903
but you must make these charges

33:47.968 --> 33:50.363
through proper
diplomatic channels

33:50.437 --> 33:52.560
after your agent
has surrendered.

33:53.268 --> 33:54.663
(grunts)

33:54.736 --> 33:58.932
I want to know where Gredenko
is and what he's doing.

33:59.005 --> 34:00.040
(whispering):
I don't know.

34:02.668 --> 34:03.780
I haven't spoken to Gredenko

34:03.836 --> 34:07.130
since he arrived
in the United States.

34:10.565 --> 34:12.400
I never said he was
in the United States.

34:16.806 --> 34:20.101
Why don't I tell you
what we know?

34:20.166 --> 34:22.130
We already know
that Gredenko supplied Fayed

34:22.208 --> 34:23.601
with the five suitcase nukes.

34:23.665 --> 34:26.763
What doesn't make sense is
why he's still involved

34:26.835 --> 34:27.902
unless, of course,
he's doing

34:27.936 --> 34:30.600
something else for Fayed.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.460
That's what we want
to know.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.860
What is Gredenko doing
for Fayed?!

34:36.166 --> 34:38.601
(whispering):
I don't know.

34:38.666 --> 34:40.761
You're gonna tell me
what I want to know

34:40.835 --> 34:42.232
or you're gonna start losing
your fingers

34:42.268 --> 34:44.703
one by one.

34:44.764 --> 34:45.763
This is
your last chance.

34:51.235 --> 34:52.931
No!

34:53.967 --> 34:55.902
(screams)

35:04.106 --> 35:05.062
I've got the feed.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.200
Don't move in yet.

35:07.267 --> 35:08.960
He's too close to Markov.

35:09.038 --> 35:11.361
You have one of
two choices.

35:11.435 --> 35:13.632
You can either give me
the information that I want

35:13.707 --> 35:16.003
and I'll go pick up Gredenko,

35:16.067 --> 35:17.060
or I can kill you.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.563
And I'll make sure
Gredenko finds out.

35:20.638 --> 35:22.533
And he'll panic
because he'll think

35:22.605 --> 35:24.033
you gave him up
before you died.

35:25.365 --> 35:26.901
He'll be forced
to use his exit route.

35:26.968 --> 35:29.360
Either way he stops what he's
doing in this country now!

35:29.437 --> 35:31.730
The choice is yours.

35:33.467 --> 35:35.500
How do I find
Gredenko?!

35:35.566 --> 35:39.460
(breathing heavily)

35:39.535 --> 35:41.363
M-Mojave Desert.

35:41.435 --> 35:42.663
Shadow Valley.

35:42.737 --> 35:43.733
Where in the
Shadow Valley?

35:43.768 --> 35:45.400
I don't know.

35:45.465 --> 35:47.262
What is
he doing?

35:47.337 --> 35:48.532
What is he doing?!

35:49.608 --> 35:51.902
Launching drones.

35:54.805 --> 35:55.731
What?

35:55.805 --> 36:00.500
Aerial drones for Fayed.

36:00.565 --> 36:03.802
His delivery system
for nuclear bombs.

36:03.865 --> 36:06.003
How soon will
the drones be ready?

36:07.005 --> 36:08.532
Two hours.

36:08.605 --> 36:12.433
In two hours, all the bombs
will be in the air.

36:12.505 --> 36:14.430
You son of a bitch.

36:14.507 --> 36:16.201
(screams)

36:16.268 --> 36:17.560
(breathing heavily)

36:19.407 --> 36:20.563
(laughs)

36:21.937 --> 36:23.031
Now!

36:25.636 --> 36:27.631
(yells)

36:34.265 --> 36:35.660
Don't let anyone near this man.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.930
Do you understand?

36:50.205 --> 36:52.033
--My fellow Americans...

36:52.108 --> 36:54.461
I regret to inform you that,
a short time ago,

36:54.535 --> 36:56.361
President Palmer was
seriously injured

36:56.437 --> 36:58.802
in an assassination
attempt at the White House.

36:58.865 --> 37:00.963
Thankfully,
he is alive

37:01.038 --> 37:04.701
and currently in
stable condition.

37:04.767 --> 37:06.702
The prime suspect,
Hamri Al-Assad,

37:06.766 --> 37:08.263
was killed in the explosion.

37:08.335 --> 37:10.733
And in light of this heinous

37:10.807 --> 37:14.231
and cowardly act, compounded
by the tragedy in California,

37:14.308 --> 37:16.400
I will be pushing forward

37:16.467 --> 37:19.260
an aggressive agenda
of national security,

37:19.336 --> 37:23.101
one that will,
out of necessity,

37:23.168 --> 37:26.031
suspend certain
civil liberties.

37:27.667 --> 37:30.462
This is the price of war.

37:30.537 --> 37:33.200
Make no mistake.

37:33.267 --> 37:35.962
That is exactly what this is.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.560
Have you been able
to reach Jack?
No,

37:37.638 --> 37:38.761
but my system logs confirm

37:38.836 --> 37:40.561
he did try to call in.

37:40.635 --> 37:41.930
Are we monitoring
communications

37:42.008 --> 37:43.960
in and out
of the Russian Consulate?
We are,

37:44.036 --> 37:45.733
but diplomatic
traffic is encrypted

37:45.808 --> 37:47.701
with an advanced algorithm
that we've never been able

37:47.738 --> 37:49.161
to crack, but...

37:49.238 --> 37:50.473
I think I have a way
around that.

37:50.507 --> 37:52.403
One of the computers
in the Consulate isn't

37:52.465 --> 37:53.771
properly shielded,
so I'm picking up

37:53.808 --> 37:55.072
a digital shadow
of their messages

37:55.106 --> 37:56.102
before they're encrypted.

37:56.105 --> 37:57.800
Look.
What's that?

37:57.867 --> 37:58.803
ASCII code.

37:58.865 --> 38:00.460
It is?
Yeah, in Russian.

38:00.535 --> 38:01.930
I just have to load
a Cyrillic grid

38:02.005 --> 38:04.462
and I should be
good to go.

38:04.535 --> 38:06.031
(speaking Russian)

38:08.066 --> 38:09.662
Oh, no.

38:09.735 --> 38:12.831
They're saying they've got
an American agent in custody.

38:12.906 --> 38:15.702
Forceful and decisive action
needs to be taken.

38:15.766 --> 38:17.260
(phone rings)

38:17.336 --> 38:19.832
And I promise you...

38:19.906 --> 38:21.001
Buchanan.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.801
Sir, Morris just intercepted
some bandwidth

38:22.867 --> 38:24.300
from the Russian Consulate.

38:24.366 --> 38:27.360
Apparently, they
got to Jack.

38:27.436 --> 38:29.132
What do you mean
"got to him"?

38:29.206 --> 38:31.703
They moved in on his position
and recovered Markov.

38:33.136 --> 38:35.202
Sir, they're holding Jack
prisoner.

38:37.238 --> 38:39.302
Sir, we probably should inform

38:39.368 --> 38:41.901
the Vice President.
No, no, not yet.

38:43.567 --> 38:47.303
He's in a diplomatic standoff
with Suvarov.

38:47.366 --> 38:50.203
He won't get anywhere
with a direct appeal.

38:50.265 --> 38:51.330
So what's our next move?

38:54.235 --> 38:57.003
Have Special Ops draw up a plan
to get into the Consulate.

38:57.066 --> 38:59.662
I want to give
the Vice President the option

38:59.737 --> 39:01.262
to take the Consul by force...

39:02.405 --> 39:04.732
...and hopefully rescue Jack.

39:04.806 --> 39:07.400
(Jack wheezing,
men speaking Russian)

39:12.708 --> 39:15.560
(coughing)

39:19.637 --> 39:22.030
(speaking Russian)

39:22.108 --> 39:23.731
Enough.

39:23.808 --> 39:26.362
Please, you have
to listen to me.
I am not
allowed to talk to you.

39:26.435 --> 39:27.603
That's because your
Consul doesn't want you

39:27.638 --> 39:29.930
to hear what I know.

39:30.006 --> 39:31.202
Dmitri Gredenko is
responsible

39:31.265 --> 39:33.133
for supplying the terrorists
with the nuclear bomb

39:33.166 --> 39:35.330
that was detonated
earlier today.

39:35.406 --> 39:36.731
Markov is working with him

39:36.806 --> 39:38.002
against the orders
of your government.

39:38.038 --> 39:39.261
(coughs)

39:39.335 --> 39:41.563
You will get the chance
to make these allegations

39:41.636 --> 39:42.703
through
the appropriate channels.

39:42.737 --> 39:45.003
No, there's not enough time.

39:45.067 --> 39:46.761
Gredenko has
three more bombs.

39:46.835 --> 39:48.030
They're going
to find their targets

39:48.068 --> 39:50.360
by way of an unmanned
drone aircraft.

39:50.438 --> 39:51.402
With the Consul's
knowledge?

39:51.436 --> 39:52.430
That is a ridiculous
accusation.

39:52.467 --> 39:54.431
He is the one who told me;
he confessed.

39:54.506 --> 39:55.933
Under duress!

39:56.008 --> 39:57.661
He gave me
Gredenko's location.

39:57.735 --> 39:59.331
He told me the aircraft
would be ready

39:59.405 --> 40:00.440
to launch
within two hours.

40:00.505 --> 40:03.333
I know you believe me!

40:03.406 --> 40:05.461
You know
about Markov's connection

40:05.535 --> 40:07.731
to Gredenko.

40:07.805 --> 40:09.400
Please.

40:09.467 --> 40:10.903
You have to help.

40:12.135 --> 40:13.730
Even if you are telling me
the truth,

40:13.806 --> 40:14.962
there is nothing
I can do.

40:15.036 --> 40:16.132
The Consul approves
all communications

40:16.166 --> 40:17.233
to Moscow.

40:17.305 --> 40:18.862
I don't want you
to call Moscow.

40:18.936 --> 40:20.100
I want you to call CTU.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.501
I want you to give them
Gredenko's location

40:22.566 --> 40:24.000
and advise them
of the time frame.

40:26.067 --> 40:27.902
Where is he?

40:27.966 --> 40:29.732
Somewhere in the high desert.

40:29.807 --> 40:30.762
The Shadow Valley.

40:31.937 --> 40:35.931
You need to call
310-597-3781.

40:36.008 --> 40:37.931
You need to tell them
you have a message

40:38.007 --> 40:41.401
for Bill Buchanan
from me.

40:41.465 --> 40:43.033
My name is Jack Bauer.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.032
(breathing heavily)

40:44.108 --> 40:47.962
Please... please.

40:48.036 --> 40:49.601
I hope you are telling me
the truth.

40:49.666 --> 40:51.832
For your sake
as well as mine.

40:51.905 --> 40:54.032
You know I am.

40:54.106 --> 40:57.302
Otherwise, you wouldn't
even consider doing this.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.133
You need to hurry.

41:38.808 --> 41:40.431
OPERATOR:
CTU.

41:40.507 --> 41:42.562
I need to speak
to Bill Buchanan.

41:42.636 --> 41:45.030
I'm sorry,
Mr. Buchanan's in a meeting.

41:45.106 --> 41:46.233
It's urgent!

41:53.408 --> 41:55.203
Mr. Buchanan,
there's a man on the line

41:55.266 --> 41:56.343
from the Russian Consulate.

41:56.405 --> 41:58.301
He says it's urgent.

41:58.366 --> 42:00.100
This is Bill Buchanan.

42:00.167 --> 42:01.530
Hello?
