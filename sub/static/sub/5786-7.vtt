WEBVTT

00:00.877 --> 00:02.420
<i>Previously on iZombie.</i>

00:02.629 --> 00:04.089
This is FBI agent
Dale Bozzio.

00:04.297 --> 00:06.549
She'll be looking
into a string of
missing person cases.

00:06.716 --> 00:09.010
<i>Seems someone
is targeting rich guys
in Seattle.</i>

00:09.219 --> 00:11.137
Suzuki's widow
gave you a brain?

00:11.346 --> 00:13.098
I can't ask our lab
to test it without saying
where it's from.

00:13.306 --> 00:14.641
I can send it into
the FBI lab.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.102
It says here you were slinging
for Stacey Boss.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.896
I need everything you
can tell me about Mr. Boss'
crime organization.

00:20.105 --> 00:22.107
<i>This wall thing?
It is a little out of date.</i>

00:22.315 --> 00:23.775
So maybe you only
have one source?

00:23.984 --> 00:25.735
And I wonder what happens
to your case

00:25.944 --> 00:27.278
if he goes away?

00:27.487 --> 00:30.156
Are you threatening me?

00:30.365 --> 00:31.241
Morning, everyone.

00:31.449 --> 00:32.450
Is this happening?

00:32.659 --> 00:33.952
It's happening.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.662
If you have sex,
Major will become a zombie.

00:35.870 --> 00:36.913
That's a certainty.

00:37.122 --> 00:38.748
- This isn't it for us.
- It's not.

00:49.801 --> 00:50.719
Phew!

00:51.886 --> 00:54.014
That was pretty good.

00:55.390 --> 00:56.433
Yeah.

00:56.641 --> 00:58.059
It was almost as good as sex.

00:58.268 --> 01:00.270
Like the difference between

01:00.478 --> 01:04.107
a turkey burger
and a hamburger.

01:04.315 --> 01:08.361
When I was 14,
I would've killed
to do what we just did.

01:08.570 --> 01:10.280
You and I
are going to be fine.

01:11.614 --> 01:12.991
So you're okay with it?

01:14.200 --> 01:16.077
Because if we're
gonna do this,

01:16.286 --> 01:18.955
we have to be totally
honest with each other
this time around.

01:20.331 --> 01:22.459
Of course I want
to sex you up, girl.

01:22.667 --> 01:26.379
You're very attractive,
and I very much have a penis.

01:27.964 --> 01:29.674
But just being with you
is enough.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.010
Honest.

01:32.218 --> 01:33.678
But being with zombie me

01:33.887 --> 01:36.139
is different than being
with old me.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.391
It's not just no sex.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.643
When I eat someone's brain,
it sets up camp in me.

01:40.852 --> 01:42.604
It's like, I'm always Britney,

01:42.812 --> 01:45.398
but sometimes I'm
<i>Hit Me Baby One
More Time Britney,</i>

01:45.607 --> 01:47.025
and sometimes I'm...

01:47.233 --> 01:49.486
Shaved head, smashing
car windows Britney.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.408
Real talk?

01:55.617 --> 01:57.285
I thought both of
those Britneys were hot.

01:57.494 --> 01:59.120
I'm kidding,

01:59.329 --> 02:00.872
I know this is serious.

02:01.081 --> 02:02.332
I just want you to know that

02:02.540 --> 02:04.375
I can hang with
whatever you throw at me.

03:11.526 --> 03:14.737
Ugh! What is that horrible,
horrible smell?

03:14.946 --> 03:16.614
I'm guessing
it's the dead body.

03:17.782 --> 03:19.284
Victim's name is Syd Wicked.

03:19.492 --> 03:22.245
Died between
12:30 and 1:00 p.m.,
when the body was found.

03:22.453 --> 03:23.580
Throat slit.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.206
Looks to have been done
with a playing card.

03:25.415 --> 03:26.583
Queen of diamonds.

03:26.791 --> 03:29.836
Had a special metal edge,
razor sharp.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.504
Any signs of a struggle?

03:31.713 --> 03:34.257
Nope. No signs of forced entry
into the room, either.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.884
No adjoining door
to another room.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.886
No unlocked windows.

03:38.094 --> 03:40.513
So whoever did this
must have been let
in through that door.

03:40.722 --> 03:42.056
Let me guess,
the security cameras were out?

03:42.265 --> 03:43.349
Nope. Fully operational.

03:43.558 --> 03:44.976
Should be waiting
for us at the precinct.

03:45.185 --> 03:46.895
What kind of name
is Syd Wicked?

03:47.103 --> 03:48.730
Stage name.
He's a magician.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.607
You don't dress like that
unless you do magic

03:50.815 --> 03:52.150
or you hate your parents.

03:52.358 --> 03:53.902
Apparently there's
some big magician convention

03:54.110 --> 03:55.820
happening at this hotel
all week.

03:56.029 --> 03:57.989
Of course. PrestoFest.

03:58.198 --> 04:00.283
How did I miss that?
I'm on the mailing list!

04:01.784 --> 04:03.953
This was in his bag.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.334
<i>Death.</i>

04:09.542 --> 04:11.669
<i>Most of us live
in constant fear
that at any moment,</i>

04:11.878 --> 04:15.798
<i>death will wrench us
into an eternal darkness.</i>

04:16.007 --> 04:19.928
<i>But I have stared
Death right in his face</i>

04:20.136 --> 04:21.304
<i>and he blinked first.</i>

04:23.431 --> 04:26.059
<i>Mark that. I'll use that
for the intro for my closer.</i>

04:26.267 --> 04:27.435
What showmanship.

04:27.644 --> 04:29.187
The world has lost
a storyteller.

04:29.562 --> 04:31.314
So, who found the body?

04:33.358 --> 04:35.151
So, the door
wasn't tampered with?

04:35.360 --> 04:36.986
No.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.863
And had you seen
anyone else come in

04:39.072 --> 04:43.159
or out of the room
other than Mr. Wicked?

04:43.368 --> 04:47.455
Uh, this morning
I came back for cleaning.

04:47.664 --> 04:50.875
There is do-not-disturb sign
on door,

04:51.084 --> 04:52.835
but yelling inside.

04:53.044 --> 04:55.088
Can you describe the voices
on the other side of the door?

04:55.296 --> 04:57.882
I just hear him yell
at the angels.

04:59.550 --> 05:00.718
The angels?

05:00.927 --> 05:02.595
Chakrabarti needs
you two upstairs.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.684
I have located the source
of that awful smell,

05:07.892 --> 05:10.019
and it is not
Clive's new cologne.

05:10.228 --> 05:11.271
You can do better than that.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.064
It played very well
in my head.

05:13.273 --> 05:15.191
I knew that smell
wasn't coming
from Syd's corpse.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.651
Too fresh, obviously.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.778
So, I took a gander
around the room,

05:18.987 --> 05:21.572
and found this
in the wastebasket,

05:22.991 --> 05:24.867
with this lovely note
attached.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.370
"Welcome to PrestoFest.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.580
"Here's a gift from
your fellow magicians."

05:29.789 --> 05:31.416
So I thinks to myself,

05:31.624 --> 05:34.335
"Hmm. Okay.
Kind of boilerplate stuff."

05:34.544 --> 05:37.588
Maybe they thought the
summer sausage would make up
for the stock sentiments.

05:37.797 --> 05:39.590
But wait, there's more.

05:39.799 --> 05:40.967
We're all hoping.

05:42.552 --> 05:43.928
Ugh!

05:46.973 --> 05:50.184
Seems like
whoever wrote that note
is a good first suspect.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.061
So how many magicians
come to this

05:52.270 --> 05:53.730
PrestoFest every year?

05:53.938 --> 05:55.732
Oh, upwards of 200.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.401
Then you have your
semi-professionals,
your weekend wizards,

05:58.609 --> 06:00.611
and the occasional hypnotist.

06:00.820 --> 06:04.782
"PrestoFest, come
for the illusions and stay
for the sleight of ha..."

06:04.991 --> 06:06.451
Looks like we're going
to be interviewing

06:06.659 --> 06:08.077
a whole lot of magicians.

06:09.454 --> 06:11.706
Sometimes I really hate
this job.

06:17.253 --> 06:18.755
Syd Wicked.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.299
I want to change my name
to something cool like that.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.134
What do you think
of Rick Bang?

06:23.343 --> 06:25.303
I think Rick Bang lives
in a one-bedroom apartment

06:25.511 --> 06:26.804
in the San Fernando Valley

06:27.013 --> 06:28.556
and gets paid
to do it on camera.

06:28.723 --> 06:31.476
Ow. Well, Steph told me how
to figure out my porn name.

06:31.684 --> 06:33.353
Sadly, it's Polly Cripplegate.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.313
Things good
with you and Steph?

06:35.521 --> 06:36.814
Yeah, they're fine, I guess.

06:37.023 --> 06:38.483
Can you have sex
without worrying

06:38.691 --> 06:40.318
you'll turn her into a member
of the undead?

06:40.526 --> 06:42.070
- Yeah.
- Then no bitching.

06:42.278 --> 06:44.197
Well, I didn't think I was.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.324
It might be time
for someone to eat.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.165
Okay, have you thought
of a card?

06:55.124 --> 06:56.417
Do you see it?

07:01.089 --> 07:02.840
The 10 of clubs is missing.

07:03.049 --> 07:04.175
Where did it go, you witch?

07:04.384 --> 07:06.135
Ah! The 10 of clovers.

07:06.344 --> 07:08.679
A clover needs
a dark space to take root.

07:08.888 --> 07:10.556
A place as dark

07:10.765 --> 07:13.351
as a closed casket
buried six feet under.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.435
That's dark.

07:14.644 --> 07:17.230
Or, a man's back pocket.

07:19.941 --> 07:22.276
This is the best brain ever.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.363
I almost want to start killing
magicians so it never ends.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.864
Got something
to show you, Liv.

07:27.949 --> 07:29.325
- Pick a card.
- No.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.873
No one goes
into the room until...

07:37.166 --> 07:39.502
...the maid finds Syd's body.

07:39.710 --> 07:40.962
Wait, right there.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.214
Three security guards
come into the room.

07:43.423 --> 07:45.174
How many come back out?

07:45.383 --> 07:46.884
- Maybe the killer
was disguised as...
- Already checked it.

07:47.093 --> 07:49.303
Three guards enter,
three guards exit.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.139
And the room had been empty
for a couple of days.

07:51.347 --> 07:53.683
So, Syd went
into his room alive,

07:53.891 --> 07:56.310
no one else
came in or out of it,

07:56.519 --> 07:57.562
and yet, he was murdered?

07:57.770 --> 07:59.105
You know
what this means, right?

07:59.313 --> 08:01.899
The murder is a magic trick.

08:02.108 --> 08:03.901
Sometimes I really love
this job.

08:29.427 --> 08:31.095
Hey.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.767
Sorry, didn't see you.

08:36.976 --> 08:38.311
Been a little on edge lately.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.812
Work stuff.

08:41.481 --> 08:43.733
How long were you
standing there?

08:43.941 --> 08:46.402
One second less than
would have been creepy?

08:46.611 --> 08:48.362
How's things in your world?

08:48.571 --> 08:50.573
Uh...

08:50.781 --> 08:52.867
You know Steph,
the woman I'm kind of seeing?

08:53.075 --> 08:54.535
"Kind of seeing."

08:54.744 --> 08:56.621
Yeah, women love when
you use qualifiers like that.

08:56.829 --> 08:59.624
I like her, it's...

08:59.832 --> 09:03.586
My question is, look, she just
changed her Facebook status
to "In a relationship."

09:03.794 --> 09:05.338
And that freaked you out.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.923
Look, I change my status
to "In a relationship"
all the time,

09:07.131 --> 09:08.466
just to get dudes
to leave me alone.

09:08.674 --> 09:09.884
Yeah. Okay.
I can see that.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.136
But...

09:12.345 --> 09:15.389
Well, she's just getting
a bit intense, you know,
okay...

09:15.556 --> 09:18.476
I mean, she told me
we're celebrating
Guy Fawkes Day tomorrow.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.311
I didn't have the heart
to tell her it was weeks ago.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.396
Guy Fawkes Day, huh?

09:23.231 --> 09:24.357
Yeah...

09:24.565 --> 09:26.526
She's definitely
going to propose.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.819
Hey, you think she...

09:33.115 --> 09:34.283
You think...

09:41.999 --> 09:42.959
You're the worst.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.377
Did I miss something?

09:44.585 --> 09:46.003
Just Peyton showing no mercy

09:46.212 --> 09:48.214
to my neuroses
about womankind.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.342
Oh, okay.
Let's get it all out
in the open, Man-Things.

09:51.551 --> 09:52.760
- What about Liv?
- Huh?

09:52.969 --> 09:54.512
Oh, she's not glomming
onto you, is she?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.305
She's cramping your style?

09:56.514 --> 09:59.725
- She's not being too needy?
- No. It's all good. Real good.

09:59.934 --> 10:01.769
Mmm?

10:01.978 --> 10:04.355
I mean, today
she left me a voicemail

10:04.564 --> 10:07.358
about how drowning
would be a beautiful
way to die,

10:07.567 --> 10:09.819
but otherwise, you know,
same old Liv.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.862
Ah, yeah, uh,
she's rolling hard

10:12.071 --> 10:13.823
on death-obsessed magician.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.909
It will pass.
She just needs to eat
someone else's brain.

10:17.118 --> 10:18.202
- Is that all?
- Hmm.

10:18.411 --> 10:19.370
Okay.

10:19.579 --> 10:22.123
So, uh, question.

10:22.290 --> 10:23.541
Since the two of you, uh,

10:23.749 --> 10:27.044
have really experienced
zombie Liv first-hand,

10:27.253 --> 10:29.380
how extreme do her personality
swings get?

10:29.589 --> 10:31.591
She can be a bit mercurial.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.801
But most of the time
I enjoy the variety.

10:33.968 --> 10:35.595
Of course,
I don't have to date her.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.888
There was the time
her eyes turned red
and she killed someone.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.599
I'm thinking
that was probably a one-off.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.725
A one-off.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.019
That's good.

10:54.030 --> 10:56.782
Well, would you look at that?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.368
The death card.

10:59.577 --> 11:01.370
The 13th trump in the Tarot.

11:02.622 --> 11:04.665
A fitting reminder that

11:04.874 --> 11:07.376
no matter how clever
a path we run,

11:08.544 --> 11:11.255
the Reaper
always takes his bounty.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.761
Did you eat Edgar Allen Poe?

11:16.969 --> 11:19.347
Odd, I was under
the impression that you knew

11:19.555 --> 11:22.183
I couldn't stand
the sight of you
and yet, here you are.

11:22.350 --> 11:25.936
I'm an acquired taste.
Like gazpacho
or that free U2 album.

11:26.145 --> 11:27.521
What do you want, Blaine?

11:27.730 --> 11:29.398
Don't worry, Liv.

11:29.607 --> 11:32.026
I'm not here to ask you to go
on a tandem bike ride with me.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.778
I'm here with some news.

11:33.986 --> 11:36.405
You know those five missing
gentlemen in the newspapers,

11:36.614 --> 11:39.075
- the ones the FBI
has seen fit to investigate?
- Yeah.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.118
Well, three of them
were big fans of brains.

11:41.327 --> 11:43.371
I know.
They were my customers.

11:43.579 --> 11:46.707
It seems someone out there
is killing Seattle's zombies.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.501
And you're here to warn me?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.294
To make sure
that I watch my back?

11:50.503 --> 11:51.629
Oh, God, no.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.422
I'm telling you this
because I need your help

11:53.631 --> 11:56.258
to stop whoever's offing
our living-challenged friends.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.803
Not to mention,
it's bad for my bottom line.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.972
So, what do you say, partner?

12:02.181 --> 12:04.934
Should we take justice
into our own hands?

12:11.607 --> 12:13.150
You need my help?

12:13.359 --> 12:16.445
I try not to make
a habit of fraternizing
with murderers.

12:16.654 --> 12:19.323
That's no way to go
through life, is it?

12:19.532 --> 12:23.202
Look, I know they brought
the FBI in on this
missing persons case.

12:23.411 --> 12:24.453
Read it in the paper.

12:24.662 --> 12:26.956
Been a Sunday subscriber
since '07, NBD.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.958
Anyway, they got this lady Fed

12:29.166 --> 12:31.377
heading up the investigation,
Dale Bozzio.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.171
Bitching name.
One you'd remember.
Ring any bells?

12:35.214 --> 12:36.424
Maybe.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.718
Because if we can know
what she knows,

12:38.926 --> 12:40.720
we stand a chance
of getting ahead of the curve.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.305
So, what do you say?
Team up with me.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.766
Stop a zombie killer,
maybe save a few lives?

12:45.975 --> 12:47.184
Have a few laughs?

12:48.310 --> 12:49.687
I don't think so.

12:51.230 --> 12:54.066
Okay, let me put
it to you in Liv-speak.

12:54.275 --> 12:56.193
Some of those missing zombies
have families

12:56.402 --> 12:57.820
and are "nice people."

12:58.028 --> 12:59.697
And more "nice people"
are going to go missing

12:59.905 --> 13:02.032
unless you and I
do something about it.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.076
Look, we know things
the FBI doesn't.

13:04.285 --> 13:05.828
So we're ahead of the curve.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.997
Help me,
Zombie Wan Kenobi.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.373
You're our only hope.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.211
This doesn't change the fact
that you still sicken me.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.629
Wouldn't be me if I didn't.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.926
I don't suppose you're here
with a new batch
of tainted Utopium.

13:21.135 --> 13:22.470
No such luck, Doc.

13:22.678 --> 13:25.389
Thanks for your help, Liv.
I'll be seeing you.

13:28.768 --> 13:30.019
Uh...

13:30.227 --> 13:31.645
He'll be seeing you?

13:31.854 --> 13:34.774
You know all those missing,
presumed-dead locals?

13:34.982 --> 13:37.151
- The ones Bozzio
is looking into?
- Yeah?

13:37.359 --> 13:38.611
They're zombies.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.112
Oh, Liv...

13:40.321 --> 13:42.198
And Blaine needs
my help finding the killer.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.828
A hotel maid says that
on the day he was murdered,

13:48.037 --> 13:50.122
she could hear
Syd inside his room,

13:50.331 --> 13:52.416
yelling at the angels,

13:52.625 --> 13:54.376
so imagine how intrigued
we were to learn

13:54.585 --> 13:56.295
that his assistant
was named Angel.

13:56.504 --> 13:57.546
Why would I kill Syd?

13:57.755 --> 13:59.256
Why was he yelling
at the angels?

14:01.634 --> 14:03.427
Because he saw me
at the hotel bar

14:03.636 --> 14:06.138
hanging out
with Amazing Dick.

14:06.347 --> 14:08.808
He's another magician.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.810
Syd was always thinking
I might leave him.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.103
- You and Syd were lovers?
- God, no.

14:13.312 --> 14:14.730
Where did you go
after your set,

14:14.939 --> 14:16.023
at the time Syd was murdered?

14:16.232 --> 14:17.983
In the lobby,
signing headshots.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.819
Lots of security cameras
in the lobby.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.112
Great. Check them. You'll see.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.157
Look, no way I'd kill Syd.

14:25.366 --> 14:27.034
That'd mean
having to find a new job.

14:27.243 --> 14:29.245
And since every other magician
despises Syd,

14:29.453 --> 14:30.621
they're not gonna hire me.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.456
Why does everyone
hate him so much?

14:32.665 --> 14:34.166
Well, he made his name

14:34.375 --> 14:36.418
destroying other
magicians' careers.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.254
Exposed all
their signature tricks.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.715
Did a whole YouTube series,
<i>Hacking Magic's Hacks.</i>

14:41.924 --> 14:43.801
Are any of those hack
magicians at the convention?

14:44.009 --> 14:45.886
Oh, yeah, a bunch.

14:46.095 --> 14:49.265
But I'd start out
with Houdina and
The Magnificent Magnus first.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.016
He really screwed them.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.476
And if you really want
to get a sense

14:52.685 --> 14:54.353
of how the magic community
felt about Syd,

14:54.562 --> 14:56.230
check out Twitter.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.941
Soak in the hate.

14:59.149 --> 15:03.779
Twitter, a vast collection
of humanity's impetuous
thought vomitings.

15:03.988 --> 15:06.198
I'd like to think
I'm quite introspective
about what I tweet

15:06.407 --> 15:08.534
to my 23 followers.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.870
Someone has to scroll through
Syd Wicked's Twitter beefs

15:11.078 --> 15:14.039
with basically every magician
who's ever existed.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.041
Uh, I'll do it!

15:16.250 --> 15:18.043
- Really?
- Absolutely.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.837
I used to be a real wand head

15:20.045 --> 15:21.630
until I realized
it didn't help me
with the ladies.

15:21.839 --> 15:25.175
So you moved on to video games
and forensic pathology.

15:25.384 --> 15:28.387
Hey, uh, Clive and I
have to go question a magician
after her show, tonight.

15:28.596 --> 15:31.265
- You want to come?
- I wish. I have a date.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.770
No peeking.
Okay, now.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.904
"Hello, Governor!
Mind the gap."

15:45.112 --> 15:46.071
Is the accent too much?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.032
This...

15:48.240 --> 15:49.700
This looked like it
took a lot of work.

15:49.909 --> 15:52.369
- You're worth it.
- Uh...

15:52.578 --> 15:55.789
- So you swung by earlier,
when I wasn't here?
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.666
I almost forgot,

15:57.875 --> 15:59.251
no Guy Fawkes celebration

15:59.460 --> 16:01.795
is complete without
a bit of footie.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.465
So, I got us some tickets
to see a soccer match

16:04.673 --> 16:06.133
when the Sounders
are back in town.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.303
Next month, right.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.680
Got a big night
of Brit stuff planned for us.

16:11.889 --> 16:14.767
Throwing darts, apologizing.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.770
Here's a lager, room temp.
Little taste of home.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.230
Drink up, you poncey geezer!

16:26.028 --> 16:28.572
Wow.
You really needed a drink.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.928
For my next trick,
I'm going to need a volunteer.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.806
You see, she doesn't
actually rip the card in half,
what she does...

16:54.014 --> 16:55.724
I get it,
it's not actual magic.

16:55.933 --> 16:58.811
You seem to have a lot to say,
why don't you come on up here?

17:02.564 --> 17:05.651
People think playing cards
are just for fun and games.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.820
But a full deck is like a gun

17:08.028 --> 17:10.656
with 52 deadly bullets
in the chamber.

17:16.662 --> 17:20.541
Now, take what's left
of the celery stalk
and hold it on your head.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.793
Turn and face me.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.760
I don't want your ring.
I'm done.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.846
I can't believe
you've bought into this crap.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.015
I don't even know
who you are anymore!

17:39.935 --> 17:42.521
Let's give
a big round of applause
to our volunteer.

17:50.362 --> 17:51.405
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

17:51.613 --> 17:52.781
She's lethal
with those cards.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.033
We'll have to check her deck.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.492
Good thing
I lifted it off her.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.753
When I was on stage,
I had a vision.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.422
I think Houdina and Syd
were getting married.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.466
I saw Houdina throwing
her diamond ring at him

18:10.674 --> 18:11.759
and calling it off.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.136
Look at this.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.221
Same tempered metal edge
that the murder weapon had.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.432
There are four face cards
missing.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.392
One of them is
the queen of diamonds.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.561
Like the one sticking
out of Syd's jugular.

18:22.770 --> 18:24.772
Well, well,
this is the first time tonight

18:24.980 --> 18:26.106
I'm interested.

18:27.983 --> 18:31.070
Houdina was giving back
her diamond ring to Syd.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.072
Maybe that wasn't
a random card.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.948
Maybe she's
the queen of diamonds.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.034
She was making a point.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.661
As much as
I've enjoyed performing
in this three-star hotel bar,

18:39.870 --> 18:41.205
I think it's just about time

18:41.413 --> 18:43.415
for me to get
the hell out of here.

18:55.928 --> 18:58.263
<i>Don't forget
to tip your servers.</i>

18:58.472 --> 19:00.933
<i>Jimmy, what do we do
with this rabbit?</i>

19:01.141 --> 19:04.144
Now would be a good time
for you to explain
how that trick worked.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.901
Seattle P.D.

19:11.110 --> 19:13.862
We'd like to ask you
some questions
about Syd Wicked.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.698
He's not dead.
I bet it's a stunt.

19:16.907 --> 19:18.534
Syd's very talented.

19:19.493 --> 19:22.121
Trust me, he's dead.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.748
Whatever you say.
I'd like my deck
of cards back.

19:24.957 --> 19:26.458
Pretty decent sleight of hand.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.127
Get a spray tan
and some sequins,

19:28.335 --> 19:29.586
you could make a few bucks.

19:29.795 --> 19:30.921
Those cards are doctored.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.506
The queen of diamonds
is missing.

19:32.714 --> 19:33.924
Any idea where that went?

19:34.133 --> 19:36.093
Probably in the garbage
when the edge got dull.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.095
If trick cards
get you all hot and bothered,

19:38.303 --> 19:41.265
you might want to check
with every magician in here.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.266
We've all got them, honey.

19:42.474 --> 19:43.976
Not every magician in here

19:44.184 --> 19:46.103
got an engagement ring
from Syd Wicked.

19:51.817 --> 19:54.444
We were young
and doing crappy clubs.

19:54.653 --> 19:56.697
Syd's whole gimmick
was the goth, death thing.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.532
But it was just
an onstage persona.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.368
- He didn't believe
in that stuff?
- Ah! No.

20:01.577 --> 20:03.495
When I met him
he was still going by Steve

20:03.704 --> 20:06.039
and owned all
the <i>Police Academy</i> movies.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.333
Over the years, he got
more and more into it.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.793
When he told me
he'd hired

20:10.002 --> 20:11.503
a Wiccan to perform
the wedding ceremony,

20:11.712 --> 20:12.796
I got the hell out of there.

20:13.005 --> 20:15.465
- How did Syd take that?
- Not well.

20:15.674 --> 20:18.302
He exposed my best trick
and destroyed me.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.555
After that,
he modified my trick
and built his career on it.

20:21.763 --> 20:22.848
So you've got
a lot of reasons

20:23.056 --> 20:24.808
why you might be
real sore at Syd.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.477
Tons.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.229
But I was on stage performing
when he quote-unquote died.

20:29.438 --> 20:32.441
I performed the autopsy.
He is dead.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.235
If you say so.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.279
Room service.
They forgot my soup.

20:42.242 --> 20:45.245
Yep. Houdina performed,
12:30 to 1:30.

20:45.454 --> 20:48.999
Even if she lied, we don't
have footage of anyone going
into that room but Syd.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.792
Should we at least
go down to the hotel bar

20:51.001 --> 20:52.252
and confirm
she did the show?

20:52.461 --> 20:53.670
Can you tackle that solo?

20:53.879 --> 20:55.339
I got something
I can't be late for.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.007
It's a date, isn't it?

20:57.216 --> 20:58.592
You're seeing a G-Man.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.900
Their movie is at 9:00.
They'll be leaving soon.

21:17.653 --> 21:18.987
What's that chick's problem?

21:19.196 --> 21:20.781
That's the empress.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.991
She symbolizes fertility

21:23.200 --> 21:25.327
and growth
in the natural world.

21:25.535 --> 21:26.370
Ancients say...

21:26.578 --> 21:27.579
Super boring.

21:27.788 --> 21:28.705
Sorry I asked.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.708
Lights out.
Right on schedule.

21:32.668 --> 21:33.835
Okay, so we get in,

21:34.044 --> 21:36.380
we get what we need
and we get out.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.882
Look at us,
on a stakeout.

21:39.091 --> 21:42.803
You're like, the stoic
by-the-book veteran
and I'm the fun guy who...

21:42.970 --> 21:45.514
Who deals drugs
and kills homeless teenagers.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.391
I was gonna say,
"Doesn't play by the rules,"

21:47.599 --> 21:48.850
but sure.

21:49.059 --> 21:50.352
Look, I'm doing this
for the cause, sister.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.853
You're doing this
for your bottom line.

21:52.062 --> 21:53.272
You're losing
paying customers.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.315
Hey, I'm likely
on that kill list, too.

21:55.524 --> 21:57.025
Nobody knows
I walk amongst the living.

22:00.529 --> 22:01.530
What's this?

22:03.532 --> 22:06.034
Yeah, I don't think they're
going to make that movie.

22:06.243 --> 22:08.704
Love is only
a delay of death,

22:08.912 --> 22:10.706
a tragedy
waiting in the wings.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.543
You're bumming me out, man.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.253
We got to come back tomorrow.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.560
Good morning, sleepyhead.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.856
You really knocked
them back last night.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.275
Hey, road trip.
What do you think?

22:38.483 --> 22:40.652
Wine country or Whistler?

22:44.448 --> 22:45.824
Are you okay?

22:46.033 --> 22:47.909
Steph, I...

22:49.369 --> 22:50.912
We need to talk.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.252
I think you're
an amazing and...

22:58.879 --> 23:01.757
...creative person and...

23:01.965 --> 23:03.592
Please stop.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.680
I'm pretty sure I know
where this speech is going.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.434
Waiting until the morning
after to let me know?

23:13.352 --> 23:14.811
Not classy.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.481
I'm... I'm sorry.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.441
I knew we'd get
to the apologizing.

23:29.659 --> 23:32.788
Ta-da!
Wasn't that easier?

23:32.996 --> 23:34.414
My tools back, please.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.793
Dale left with her gym bag.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.961
I'd say we have about an hour.

23:41.213 --> 23:43.507
Uh... I'd say 90 minutes.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.509
You don't get that ass
in an hour a day.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.845
Well, isn't that fortunate.

23:49.054 --> 23:51.765
She left everything
out for us. The whole file.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.184
How do we do this?

23:54.393 --> 23:56.686
You take everything
on that side.
I got everything on this side.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.146
Okay.

24:04.653 --> 24:06.613
What?

24:07.697 --> 24:09.366
Here, here, here.

24:09.574 --> 24:12.119
"Found in the home
refrigerators of three
of the missing persons,

24:12.327 --> 24:15.372
"identical insulated
yellow coolers."

24:15.580 --> 24:18.583
Damn it. We should've gone
with the freezer bags.

24:18.792 --> 24:20.669
I'm such a slave
to aesthetics.

24:20.877 --> 24:24.256
They've identified a hair
found in the sink drain
of Meat Cute

24:24.464 --> 24:28.718
as belonging to missing
astronaut Alan York.

24:28.927 --> 24:30.720
You killed the fourth man
who walked on the moon?

24:30.929 --> 24:33.181
Please, nobody cares
about the fourth person
to do something.

24:42.399 --> 24:45.402
I don't think the Feds
know anything more than we do.

24:45.610 --> 24:46.862
So what's the plan
if we figure out

24:47.070 --> 24:48.572
who's been making
these zombies disappear?

24:48.780 --> 24:51.032
I suppose
we lodge a complaint?

24:51.241 --> 24:53.910
Ask the perpetrator
to reconsider his actions.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.245
I'm not hurting anyone.

24:55.454 --> 24:56.872
You seemed
happy enough to shoot me.

25:10.469 --> 25:12.929
Mail from the FBI test lab.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.306
I say we open it.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.641
Careful. It can't
look tampered with.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.101
This begs the question

25:18.310 --> 25:19.936
that haunts
all prestidigitators.

25:20.145 --> 25:23.899
How does one get
inside a sealed space
without truly entering?

25:24.107 --> 25:28.111
How does one make the inside,
become the outside?

25:28.320 --> 25:31.698
First, one must...

25:31.907 --> 25:34.576
Did you hear the part
where I said it couldn't be
tampered with?

25:34.784 --> 25:36.703
Nope.

25:36.912 --> 25:39.664
Oh. Looks like your best bud
Babineaux was about
to find out

25:39.873 --> 25:42.959
Lieutenant Suzuki
kept human brains
in his mini-fridge.

25:43.168 --> 25:45.795
- We can't let Dale see this.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God! Wait.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.672
I've got it.
We throw it away.

25:47.881 --> 25:50.300
No, if she doesn't get this,
she'll follow up on it.

25:50.509 --> 25:52.469
I think I can doctor this up
and drop it back off here.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.513
Make it say the brain
was from a cow.

25:56.765 --> 25:58.016
Find the queen.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.524
That one.

26:07.234 --> 26:09.152
Whoa. Every time.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.196
You're good at this.
You study magic?

26:11.404 --> 26:14.866
I grew up in Brooklyn.
We don't play in Brooklyn.

26:15.075 --> 26:17.244
You gotta keep
working on it, kid.
Meet me next time.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.121
There's our guy.

26:24.876 --> 26:26.586
Magnus?

26:26.795 --> 26:28.505
Clive Babineaux
and Olivia Moore
with the Seattle P.D.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.173
Yeah.
Do I make it to both of you?

26:30.382 --> 26:31.675
Or did you each want your own?

26:31.883 --> 26:35.595
No. We're here to ask
you about Syd Wicked.

26:35.804 --> 26:37.889
- You've heard he was murdered?
- Are you sure he's dead?

26:38.098 --> 26:39.808
It might be a stunt.
He's very skilled.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.143
I personally removed
his brain from his body.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.729
Still...

26:44.938 --> 26:46.731
We heard there might
have been some bad blood
between you two.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.358
We saw Syd's YouTube video

26:48.567 --> 26:51.403
where he exposed your
floating candelabra trick.

26:51.611 --> 26:52.946
Any reason he'd do that?

26:55.031 --> 26:56.533
Back in my salad days,

26:56.741 --> 26:59.119
before young
Master Wicked ruined me,

26:59.327 --> 27:00.954
he was my opening act.

27:01.162 --> 27:03.873
One day, he came to me
asking me to provide him

27:04.082 --> 27:06.042
15 extra minutes nightly.

27:06.251 --> 27:08.670
I refused,
thought nothing of it.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.005
But then some months later,

27:10.213 --> 27:11.464
when I'd finished
my autobiography,

27:11.631 --> 27:14.718
<i>This is Where the Magic
Happens</i>, $29.95,

27:14.926 --> 27:18.805
I asked Syd to provide a pithy
quote for the back cover

27:19.014 --> 27:22.767
and he did not
have pleasant things to say.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.311
Do you remember what he said?

27:24.519 --> 27:27.439
Let's just say
the quote wasn't usable.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.151
You expect me to use this?

27:31.359 --> 27:32.819
"For those of you
who enjoy watching

27:33.028 --> 27:35.196
"the carcass of old school
magic decay,

27:35.405 --> 27:37.365
"this book's for you."

27:42.162 --> 27:43.121
Madam?

27:43.330 --> 27:44.956
Was the blurb something like,

27:45.165 --> 27:48.126
"For those who enjoy
watching the carcass

27:48.335 --> 27:51.129
"of old magic decay,
this book's for you"?

27:51.338 --> 27:52.714
Something in that realm.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.674
There was a dead fish
in Syd's room

27:54.883 --> 27:56.760
with a note
from his magician friends,

27:56.968 --> 27:58.094
"Enjoy the decay."

28:00.096 --> 28:01.931
It was meant to be a prank.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.933
A trifle, really.

28:04.142 --> 28:06.436
Something to show him,
the old man still has it.

28:06.645 --> 28:08.688
Right.

28:08.897 --> 28:12.692
And where were you
between 12:30 and 1:00 p.m.
the day Syd was murdered?

28:12.901 --> 28:15.403
Uh, I can tell you
exactly where I was,

28:15.612 --> 28:18.490
though I'm afraid the details
might be rather tawdry.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.367
You see, that afternoon,

28:20.575 --> 28:23.453
I was savoring
a Mai Tai in the lobby bar,

28:23.662 --> 28:25.955
when I was approached
by an enchanting,

28:26.164 --> 28:28.625
auburn-haired beauty
with eyes of green

28:28.833 --> 28:29.959
and a bountiful bosom.

28:30.168 --> 28:33.672
She was familiar
with my work,

28:33.880 --> 28:37.175
and suggested
we seek privacy
in the lobby men's room.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.636
- Where there are no cameras.
- Convenient.

28:39.844 --> 28:44.099
We needed somewhere
we could fully explore
each other's bodies.

28:44.307 --> 28:46.768
Regrettably, I never managed
to get her name.

28:46.976 --> 28:47.852
Mmm-hmm.

28:48.061 --> 28:49.270
Excuse us.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.692
There's no way
any auburn-haired beauty

28:53.900 --> 28:55.610
did the nasty
in a bathroom
with that dude.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.029
But we can't place him
in Syd's room anyway.

28:58.822 --> 28:59.948
What?

29:02.826 --> 29:04.828
That kid magician
stole my watch.

29:10.542 --> 29:14.045
This flower had color
and could bloom once.

29:14.254 --> 29:17.173
And yet death,
blind to the beauty
of all living things,

29:17.382 --> 29:20.760
even one as vibrant as this,
has swept over it,

29:22.303 --> 29:24.222
wrenching it closer
to the ground.

29:24.431 --> 29:27.767
Until it breaks.

29:30.687 --> 29:33.565
So, is that a "yes,"
you want a quesadilla or no?

29:34.524 --> 29:36.317
Sorry, I'm good.

29:36.526 --> 29:38.611
It's this brain I'm on.
It can get pretty dark.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.613
Hey, no, listen.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.992
Uh, we promised
we're gonna be honest
with each other, uh...

29:44.200 --> 29:47.328
I want to know what's going on
in that beautiful
undead head of yours.

29:47.537 --> 29:49.289
Well, you know
those missing rich people?

29:50.331 --> 29:51.291
Yeah?

29:52.500 --> 29:54.836
They're zombies.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.298
Someone is going around
the city taking out zombies.

29:59.340 --> 30:00.550
I could be next.

30:03.178 --> 30:05.305
I promise,
that's not going
to happen to you.

30:06.681 --> 30:08.516
That's not something
you can promise.

30:09.934 --> 30:12.479
<i>♪ O Danny boy</i>

30:12.687 --> 30:15.857
<i>♪ The pipes,
the pipes are calling</i>

30:17.025 --> 30:19.360
<i>♪ From glen to glen</i>

30:19.569 --> 30:22.739
<i>♪ And down the mountainside ♪</i>

30:23.656 --> 30:25.241
Hello?

30:25.450 --> 30:27.118
Why, hello.

30:27.327 --> 30:28.578
What a pleasant surprise.

30:28.787 --> 30:30.038
You have quite the voice.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.332
I was lead tenor
in my grade school choir.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.710
Hmm. Second lead,

30:35.919 --> 30:38.797
and then Tommy Fitzpatrick
had an unfortunate fall.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.049
So clumsy, that kid.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.550
So, what brings you in?

30:42.759 --> 30:44.928
I got a surprise visit
at work from Mr. Boss.

30:45.136 --> 30:47.055
Ah! He never calls first.

30:47.263 --> 30:49.224
He saw our big board
with the information you gave.

30:49.432 --> 30:52.101
He said some of it
was out of date.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.646
I think he knows our source
used to work for him.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.356
Thought you might want
the heads up on that.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.233
Much obliged.

30:58.441 --> 30:59.526
You know,
for a little guy, he's...

30:59.734 --> 31:01.361
- Enormously terrifying?
- Yeah.

31:01.569 --> 31:02.695
Yeah.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.864
Here, take this.

31:07.909 --> 31:11.204
- A free car wash?
- Whoops, wrong card.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.706
I don't think our relationship
is quite at that level yet.

31:14.624 --> 31:15.750
Here you go.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.043
It's my cell.

31:17.252 --> 31:19.170
So the next time
Mr. Boss drops by

31:19.379 --> 31:22.215
or if you're just feeling
the heebie-jeebies,
give me a call.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.894
Would the FBI
call them "cow brains"
or "bovine"?

31:35.103 --> 31:36.354
Bovine.

31:36.563 --> 31:39.607
The FBI are
a very formal outfit.

31:39.816 --> 31:42.485
These angry magician
tweets are fantastic.

31:42.694 --> 31:44.988
People really hated Syd.
Listen to this one.

31:45.196 --> 31:46.865
"The greatest trick
you've ever pulled

31:47.073 --> 31:48.783
"is convincing the world
you have talent."

31:48.992 --> 31:51.744
Hashtag, "You look like
you live in your
mom's basement,"

31:51.911 --> 31:53.371
hashtag,
"Who wears thumb rings?"

31:53.580 --> 31:54.873
Who are those from?

31:55.081 --> 31:58.376
Only local comedy magic duo
Smoak and Meers,

31:58.585 --> 32:01.462
taking a break from their
rocket ship to fame.

32:01.671 --> 32:03.172
Whoa, whoa, hold up.

32:03.381 --> 32:06.676
Syd responded
and it just reads,
"You're next,"

32:06.885 --> 32:09.679
followed by an emoji
of an anvil, an explosion,

32:09.888 --> 32:11.639
two skulls and a finger
pointing at them.

32:11.848 --> 32:13.349
That seems mildly threatening.

32:13.558 --> 32:15.018
Well, Smoak and Meers'
most famous trick

32:15.226 --> 32:16.644
is having an anvil
drop on Meers.

32:16.853 --> 32:18.980
I think Syd was threatening
to expose that trick.

32:19.188 --> 32:20.857
Are there any tweets
from them after that one?

32:21.065 --> 32:22.567
Nope. None. They stop.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.153
Hashtag, "I think we
have a new lead."

32:25.361 --> 32:27.238
- Don't do that.
- Hmm.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.991
<i>Most magicians working today</i>

32:30.199 --> 32:32.493
<i>aren't having a real dialog
with the audience.</i>

32:32.702 --> 32:36.164
<i>Everyone involved
in the experience
should have a voice.</i>

32:36.372 --> 32:38.416
<i>Except this guy.</i>

32:38.625 --> 32:40.710
We're gonna have
to take that again.
We got two bogies in the shot.

32:40.919 --> 32:43.004
- Smoak and Meers?
- Guilty.

32:43.212 --> 32:45.048
Seattle P.D.,
could we have a moment?

32:46.507 --> 32:47.800
<i>Maybe with the cameras
turned off?</i>

32:48.009 --> 32:49.677
<i>Sorry, we film it all.</i>

32:49.886 --> 32:52.347
It's for a cable special.
Premium.

32:52.555 --> 32:53.973
We're sort of a big deal.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.434
That's nice.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.519
How long have you two
had a feud with Syd Wicked?

32:58.728 --> 33:00.980
Wow. Gonna just jump
right in there, Lady Cop.

33:01.189 --> 33:03.316
Where's the craft?
The showmanship?

33:03.524 --> 33:05.234
Look, you know
the score with Syd.

33:05.443 --> 33:08.196
Everyone in this business
had a beef with the guy.
But us?

33:08.404 --> 33:09.614
We just liked
screwing with him.

33:09.822 --> 33:10.990
He thought
he was better than us.

33:13.201 --> 33:14.994
Let's start with you,
Harpo Marx.

33:15.203 --> 33:17.872
Where were you between
12:30 and 1:00 p.m.
the day Syd was killed?

33:22.210 --> 33:23.878
This isn't a bit.

33:24.087 --> 33:26.047
Let's do this
the old-fashioned way,
with our voices.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.215
That's going to be difficult.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.217
My associate is mute,

33:29.425 --> 33:31.511
Detective Babineaux.

33:32.804 --> 33:34.514
Give me that.

33:34.722 --> 33:36.265
And thank you for this bit
of unscripted levity

33:36.474 --> 33:38.810
that will surely end up
in our TV special.

33:39.018 --> 33:41.980
<i>Grilled about a murder.
Good stuff, huh?</i>

33:42.188 --> 33:43.856
And where were you
at the time of the murder?

33:44.065 --> 33:45.692
The Houdina show.

33:45.900 --> 33:48.069
I remember because
she disappeared
during her closer

33:48.277 --> 33:49.779
and she never came back
for a bow.

33:49.988 --> 33:51.114
I waited around
for 15 minutes.

33:51.322 --> 33:52.907
It was actually
kind of punk rock.

33:55.952 --> 33:57.495
If Houdina disappeared
for that long,

33:57.704 --> 33:59.914
that means her alibi
doesn't really check out.

34:07.755 --> 34:09.590
You weren't performing
when Syd was killed.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.926
You'd already disappeared
off-stage for your closer.

34:12.135 --> 34:14.012
Guys, I didn't
actually disappear.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.805
I hate to break this to you.

34:16.014 --> 34:18.016
Magic isn't real.

34:18.224 --> 34:20.435
You remember
the cocktail waitress
at the end of the show?

34:20.643 --> 34:22.854
The one you asked
if she knew where I was?

34:23.062 --> 34:25.732
That was me. I had her costume
on underneath mine.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.066
But I looked right at you.

34:27.275 --> 34:28.985
That's the thing
about a magic trick.

34:29.193 --> 34:30.737
If it's done well,
the answer's
right in front of you.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.325
There was only one person
we know for sure
that went in Syd's room.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.953
The maid.

34:39.162 --> 34:41.914
We haven't seen Irina
since she found the body.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.458
Mind giving us
her home address?

34:43.666 --> 34:45.001
We'd like to follow up.

34:46.461 --> 34:48.880
Irina was undocumented.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.257
We paid her in cash.

34:52.759 --> 34:54.218
We're never gonna find her.

34:55.344 --> 34:56.596
Liv?

34:59.974 --> 35:01.350
She's still in the hotel.

35:11.569 --> 35:13.529
No way.

35:13.738 --> 35:16.032
You two go ahead.
I'll meet you in the ballroom.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.869
<i>There are two parts
to this trick.</i>

35:20.078 --> 35:21.245
<i>First part is,</i>

35:21.454 --> 35:23.831
I lift a real anvil
over Meers' head.

35:24.832 --> 35:26.042
<i>Second part?</i>

35:26.250 --> 35:27.293
<i>I drop it on him.</i>

35:28.753 --> 35:30.546
<i>Now, right before I drop it,</i>

35:30.755 --> 35:32.298
<i>I usually
say something like...</i>

35:32.507 --> 35:33.716
Got another bogie.

35:36.719 --> 35:37.845
This guy.

35:38.888 --> 35:41.015
You, you're under arrest.

35:42.892 --> 35:44.102
<i>Hey, can you shut those off?</i>

35:44.310 --> 35:45.686
Uh, no way.

35:57.031 --> 35:58.241
What the hell is going on?

35:58.449 --> 36:00.368
You want me
to just tell you?

36:00.576 --> 36:02.161
What happened
to showmanship?

36:02.370 --> 36:04.247
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:04.455 --> 36:07.750
allow me to blow the lid off
one masterful trick.

36:07.959 --> 36:09.377
You see,
we were led to believe

36:09.585 --> 36:12.004
the only the mortal souls
to enter Syd's quarters

36:12.171 --> 36:13.923
were the maid
and Syd himself.

36:14.132 --> 36:17.301
<i>But if you study
the trick very closely,</i>

36:17.510 --> 36:20.388
you'll see there's
one other person
who entered that room,

36:21.430 --> 36:22.849
Mr. Meers.

36:23.057 --> 36:24.267
He wasn't anywhere
near that room.

36:24.475 --> 36:25.601
Oh?

36:25.810 --> 36:27.019
But she was!

36:32.024 --> 36:33.442
- Irina?
- Indeed.

36:33.651 --> 36:35.153
You see Smoak and Meers

36:35.361 --> 36:38.197
knew that Syd was going
to expose their biggest trick.

36:38.406 --> 36:41.284
Ruin them like he had
so many magicians.

36:41.492 --> 36:44.996
That's why Meers took
a part-time job here,
as Irina.

36:45.204 --> 36:47.623
And when the time came,
she entered his room,

36:47.832 --> 36:50.168
<i>slayed him with a razor-sharp
playing card</i>

36:50.376 --> 36:51.794
and then ran out.

36:52.003 --> 36:53.504
Just as we saw
on security footage.

36:53.713 --> 36:54.797
Ta-da.

36:55.006 --> 36:56.799
It was almost
the perfect magic trick.

36:57.008 --> 36:58.801
Except I noticed
Irina's writing

36:59.010 --> 37:00.303
on the housekeeping board.

37:00.511 --> 37:02.054
Looked a hell
of a lot like Meers'.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.806
Right down to the ampersand.

37:04.015 --> 37:05.808
Who uses ampersands anymore?

37:06.017 --> 37:08.936
I hope you brought
a second set of cuffs,
Detective Babineaux.

37:09.145 --> 37:11.063
Because this magician
had an assistant.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.815
I had nothing to do with this.
It was all her.

37:13.024 --> 37:14.901
<i>You lying son of a bitch!</i>

37:15.735 --> 37:16.777
Behold!

37:22.491 --> 37:25.620
- I can come out now?
- Yeah.

37:25.828 --> 37:31.000
Behold, Magnus' auburn-haired,
ample-bosomed beauty.

37:31.209 --> 37:33.461
He said that? Aw.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.838
Destiny, please point
to the man who hired you

37:36.047 --> 37:38.883
to romance Magnus
away from security cameras,

37:39.091 --> 37:41.052
thereby destroying
his only alibi.

37:41.802 --> 37:42.803
Him.

37:46.015 --> 37:47.892
Tell me you're getting this.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.189
Normally we bring witnesses
down to the station
to take statements.

37:53.397 --> 37:55.024
Where's the magic in that?

38:38.651 --> 38:40.278
- You okay?
- Oh... Oh, my God.

38:40.486 --> 38:41.946
Sorry.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.406
I should really start
announcing myself with fanfare

38:43.614 --> 38:44.782
before I enter a room.

38:44.991 --> 38:47.910
Ah... I am such a dork.

38:48.119 --> 38:49.328
Ugh.

38:51.872 --> 38:54.333
How about we
throw on a flick, hang out?

38:54.542 --> 38:55.835
Well, what did you
have in mind?

38:56.043 --> 38:57.628
Maybe we could finally,
actually,

38:57.837 --> 39:00.047
see that <i>Vertigo</i> movie
you're always going on about.

39:00.256 --> 39:02.466
That sounds
like just my speed.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.471
Whoa.

39:08.472 --> 39:09.724
Aren't you seeing Steph?

39:10.891 --> 39:12.310
Well, I, uh, I ended it.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.272
Maybe this was a bad idea,
moving in.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.774
No, no, no, no, no, no, stay.

39:18.983 --> 39:20.693
I'm an idiot.

39:20.901 --> 39:22.987
Maybe I've been drinking?

39:23.195 --> 39:25.239
- No, it's just the idiocy.
- Hey, hey, hey.

39:25.448 --> 39:28.701
Don't sweat it. Look, I think
you're amazing and funny.

39:31.037 --> 39:33.080
- It's just, I met...
- No need to explain.

39:33.289 --> 39:35.666
You're a good man,
Chakrabarti.

39:35.875 --> 39:37.251
We can still hang though.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.504
<i>Vertigo,</i> come on, finally.

39:40.713 --> 39:44.175
You know, I don't think so.
I'm gonna head upstairs.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.469
This Hare Krishna
handed me a pamphlet
about karma.

39:46.677 --> 39:48.012
Been meaning
to check it out, so...

40:06.655 --> 40:08.032
Cow brains.

40:12.536 --> 40:13.704
Maybe they're right.

40:15.498 --> 40:16.999
Maybe I'm chasing ghosts.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.127
I mean, I actually thought

40:20.336 --> 40:22.880
Suzuki had a human brain
in his freezer.

40:25.007 --> 40:26.384
That's crazy, isn't it?

40:31.138 --> 40:33.307
You seem disappointed
it's not human.

40:38.479 --> 40:39.814
I don't know.

40:40.815 --> 40:42.024
Maybe I am.

41:34.368 --> 41:35.244
Major?

41:37.580 --> 41:38.456
Major!
