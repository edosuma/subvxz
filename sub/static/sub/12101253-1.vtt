WEBVTT

00:00.861 --> 00:04.510
The Great War. Supposedly finished before
After Christmas, the carnage goes on forever.

00:04.534 --> 00:07.961
In Britain, valid men
They get ready to do their duty.

00:07.985 --> 00:11.900
Those who refuse to enlist receive a
white feather, symbol of cowardice and betrayal.

00:12.131 --> 00:15.531
The Germans held at bay.

01:16.417 --> 01:19.659
<i>Morning Standard,</i>
Get the <i>Morning Standard.</i>

01:19.792 --> 01:23.893
<i>Morning Standard,</i>
Get the <i>Morning Standard.</i>

01:23.917 --> 01:25.451
Excuse me.

01:26.334 --> 01:27.560
Dad.

01:27.584 --> 01:29.102
Dad!

01:29.126 --> 01:30.768
- What are you doing here?
- My duty.

01:30.792 --> 01:32.034
Like you.

01:32.667 --> 01:35.034
You are a good boy. Come here.

01:36.542 --> 01:37.742
The best.

01:38.376 --> 01:39.576
Go ahead.

01:45.251 --> 01:46.977
We discovered ourselves in front of me.

01:47.001 --> 01:48.810
Come on, bunch of arrears!

01:48.834 --> 01:51.602
The king is waiting
and he pays for your exam.

01:51.626 --> 01:54.310
Let's go quickly!

01:54.334 --> 01:57.643
The doctors will
wait, the king pays.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.284
We move!

02:01.001 --> 02:02.201
Go.

02:03.167 --> 02:04.617
Turn your head.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.826
Go.

02:13.584 --> 02:16.409
L, D, X.

02:22.098 --> 02:25.393
<i>HELL UNDER EARTH.</i>

02:25.417 --> 02:26.826
Next.

02:37.209 --> 02:39.326
Breath deeply.

02:43.209 --> 02:44.701
Profession?

02:45.209 --> 02:46.534
Accounting.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.909
Since when?

02:50.376 --> 02:51.784
Since ever.

02:53.334 --> 02:54.617
I see.

02:56.292 --> 02:59.227
Has a rattle
crackling in the lungs.

02:59.251 --> 03:03.492
You must have inhaled
too much pencil dust

03:04.209 --> 03:05.602
over time.

03:05.626 --> 03:08.727
Also, your heart
it has an irregular rhythm.

03:08.751 --> 03:10.784
Surely he is hereditary.

03:12.042 --> 03:15.227
I imagine you already know all this.

03:15.251 --> 03:18.534
Not the first
time it is presented.

03:20.084 --> 03:23.602
I can do it.
I just want to do my duty.

03:23.626 --> 03:26.268
I'd say you already do.

03:26.292 --> 03:30.534
Not? The ones below count
as much as the ones above.

03:33.001 --> 03:35.185
The Ministry of
War wants to impose

03:35.209 --> 03:38.268
certain selection criteria.

03:38.292 --> 03:41.534
I must abide by these rules.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.435
You don't have to be ashamed.

03:44.459 --> 03:47.284
I understand, I would like
an opportunity...

03:47.542 --> 03:48.742
Next!

03:56.459 --> 03:58.492
- Age?
- 25 years.

03:58.792 --> 04:01.284
I swear to submit to authority.

04:03.084 --> 04:06.326
Generals and all
my superiors.

04:08.751 --> 04:11.534
And serve until
end of the war.

04:13.876 --> 04:15.367
God save the king.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.201
- Dad.
- So tell me.

04:22.584 --> 04:24.867
All right, they caught me.

04:26.751 --> 04:30.534
No, keep it.
You are now a man.

04:34.102 --> 04:35.802
Battle of the Somme, 1916

04:35.876 --> 04:38.102
Take this, the phone doesn't work.

04:38.126 --> 04:40.768
Communications 113.
Capital importance.

04:40.792 --> 04:42.102
The fight resumes!

04:42.126 --> 04:43.451
Get moving!

04:44.751 --> 04:46.659
Soldier, tell them ...

04:50.459 --> 04:51.784
Go!

04:59.751 --> 05:00.992
Head down!

05:02.584 --> 05:04.060
Stretcher carriers!

05:04.084 --> 05:05.992
Others are coming!

05:29.084 --> 05:31.451
Prepare for the counterattack!

05:39.501 --> 05:40.893
What are you doing here?

05:40.917 --> 05:42.784
Message from extension 23.

05:49.751 --> 05:52.727
Headquarters, extension 299.

05:52.751 --> 05:55.102
The infantry did not break
the front line.

05:55.126 --> 05:59.909
We do not take the
German trenches.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.518
How many human losses?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.992
40,000, according to estimates.

06:18.084 --> 06:19.326
Why?

06:21.001 --> 06:23.268
Seven days that we throw away

06:23.292 --> 06:25.951
everything we have in
against your lines.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.018
How many tons?

06:28.042 --> 06:29.951
A million and a half. 

06:31.709 --> 06:33.742
A million and a half.

06:34.126 --> 06:35.977
However you tell me

06:36.001 --> 06:37.727
that we have not made a gap.

06:37.751 --> 06:39.284
Reports indicate

06:39.501 --> 06:44.326
that the germans dug
their bunkers 10 m underground.

06:45.001 --> 06:46.518
With all due respect,

06:46.542 --> 06:49.393
at this depth,
all the artillery in the world

06:49.417 --> 06:51.018
I could not do anything.

06:51.042 --> 06:52.242
Apparently.

06:52.709 --> 06:54.560
We could go backwards.

06:54.584 --> 06:56.034
And lose ground? Not.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.560
- General...
- We will not give up

06:58.584 --> 07:00.409
one centimeter of land.

07:00.959 --> 07:02.576
Understood?

07:03.001 --> 07:05.576
For that, you must have faith.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.685
This is an aspect
essential, we must believe

07:08.709 --> 07:11.784
in their duty, in their
own capabilities.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.727
Believe in victory.

07:13.751 --> 07:17.935
General, we can't hold the front
indefinitely. We need...

07:17.959 --> 07:20.227
Another decisive assault.

07:20.251 --> 07:21.826
I agree.

07:22.167 --> 07:25.201
Germans know that
we have the best army.

07:26.084 --> 07:30.242
Your morale will be damaged
by repeated attacks.

07:31.126 --> 07:33.201
General, if I can ...

07:33.376 --> 07:35.534
If you insist, Jack.

07:36.792 --> 07:40.143
Our assault must be decisive.
It's fair.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.935
But to break the German front,

07:41.959 --> 07:44.185
we will have to innovate,

07:44.209 --> 07:46.560
we must surprise the Boches.

07:46.584 --> 07:51.201
And you know how to do it, I guess?

07:52.376 --> 07:54.534
Of course.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.576
Monsieur will
wait in his office.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.034
Thanks.

08:17.334 --> 08:19.977
With due respect,
the answer is no.

08:20.001 --> 08:23.935
Without these men, can you imagine
the drop in production?

08:23.959 --> 08:27.409
He will get fair compensation.

08:27.709 --> 08:30.393
Let me decide what is fair.

08:30.417 --> 08:33.393
It's a period
important for us.

08:33.417 --> 08:36.227
In fact, for
all of Britain.

08:36.251 --> 08:39.643
Spare me your speech
good soldier.

08:39.667 --> 08:43.576
Everyone is doing the part of it.
If you don't have anything else

08:43.833 --> 08:45.727
I have things to do.

08:45.751 --> 08:49.576
You are absolutely right.
Everyone is doing their part.

08:50.042 --> 08:51.643
The soldiers at the front

08:51.667 --> 08:55.034
men and women
in forges and mills,

08:56.001 --> 08:58.951
and you, even if you
he does not know what he is doing.

08:59.459 --> 09:01.435
I despise even more than the enemy

09:01.459 --> 09:04.576
those who trample our
dead and are called patriots.

09:05.167 --> 09:07.352
I knew, a few months ago,

09:07.376 --> 09:10.518
an arrogant man,
at the head of his fiefdom.

09:10.542 --> 09:12.852
It was believed by
on top of the war.

09:12.876 --> 09:16.326
We decided to show it to you
closer.

09:17.626 --> 09:19.201
You see what I mean?

09:23.501 --> 09:26.852
Fortunately
there are people like you

09:26.876 --> 09:30.617
who understand that the
drive is necessary.

09:30.792 --> 09:32.159
Of course.

09:33.376 --> 09:36.893
Then I will ask you with respect

09:36.917 --> 09:40.367
give your country what it asks for.

09:43.876 --> 09:46.435
When the
papers, our office

09:46.459 --> 09:49.992
ensures the receipt of funds.

09:50.792 --> 09:53.451
I understand that it sounds unusual.

09:53.792 --> 09:57.076
But I have to talk to them
of an important topic.

09:58.334 --> 09:59.701
Would you mind?

10:10.334 --> 10:12.034
It's better that way.

10:12.334 --> 10:17.076
Don't believe the newspapers.
We are losing the war.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.893
If we don't act,
we will have to surrender.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.102
I listened.

10:22.126 --> 10:24.768
This jerk is going to retain
that of our pay.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.477
Can we get it over with?

10:26.501 --> 10:27.867
Very well.

10:28.459 --> 10:31.076
Your country needs you.

10:44.917 --> 10:47.935
During these few laughs,

10:47.959 --> 10:51.117
one of our soldiers
got shot in the head,

10:51.584 --> 10:55.352
a father salto about
one bomb, another,

10:55.376 --> 10:58.659
maybe a friend of hers was
gutted by a shell.

11:00.001 --> 11:02.852
I also like to laugh

11:02.876 --> 11:06.534
but let me describe
our situation.

11:14.001 --> 11:15.201
Come closer.

11:24.126 --> 11:25.826
This is the Somme.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.951
There are the allied lines.

11:31.292 --> 11:34.310
There is the German front.

11:34.334 --> 11:37.227
Germans
they built bunkers

11:37.251 --> 11:39.602
at a depth of 10 meters.

11:39.626 --> 11:42.060
We try everything against them.

11:42.084 --> 11:44.435
And nothing.
The Boches have so many possibilities

11:44.459 --> 11:47.268
of slipping into your sauerkraut
Than take a bomb

11:47.292 --> 11:50.018
When the bombing stops

11:50.042 --> 11:53.409
they go out and practice shooting against
our boys.

11:54.876 --> 11:57.060
The morale of the troops
is at its lowest point.

11:57.084 --> 12:01.060
And in Flanders,
we need a win

12:01.084 --> 12:04.643
to show our men
that we can still win.

12:04.667 --> 12:08.159
Sorry but what have you got
what to do with us?

12:10.001 --> 12:14.451
The Boches are difficult
to reach from the sky.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.951
- There is another option.
- Dig.

12:19.459 --> 12:20.909
Exactly.

12:21.876 --> 12:25.701
Let's dig a
tunnel under no man's land

12:26.292 --> 12:28.826
and send the enemy
to the other world.

12:29.917 --> 12:34.477
Our first goal is
this top-of-the-line bunker.

12:34.501 --> 12:38.117
A little bastard chases
and kill our boys.

12:38.417 --> 12:41.227
Our first
tunnels were failures.

12:41.251 --> 12:43.826
They collapsed in 24 hours.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.701
What is the soil?

12:47.792 --> 12:48.992
Clay.

12:50.792 --> 12:55.492
Frankly, we don't have
the abilities. But you do.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.102
A platoon is in Salisbury.

12:58.126 --> 13:00.893
Will have to
teach them to dig clay

13:00.917 --> 13:02.977
and placing explosives.

13:03.001 --> 13:04.451
Then...

13:04.959 --> 13:07.367
How much time do we have, sir?

13:08.376 --> 13:09.518
One month.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.227
For the love of God...

13:11.251 --> 13:14.852
The platoon will be 3 months old
to fulfill the mission in France.

13:14.876 --> 13:16.159
Not.

13:17.084 --> 13:18.893
We have no choice.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.992
They will not.

13:22.751 --> 13:23.992
Your name?

13:24.501 --> 13:26.060
William Hawkin, sir.

13:26.084 --> 13:30.326
Mr. Hawkin, if you like
speak up, now is the time.

13:30.751 --> 13:32.893
I have met few piercers

13:32.917 --> 13:35.018
in my life, but I doubt

13:35.042 --> 13:37.310
they can dig so fast.

13:37.334 --> 13:40.451
The risk of
landslide is constant.

13:40.667 --> 13:45.018
We've been doing this all of our
life, but there is always a risk.

13:45.042 --> 13:48.560
No. If you want to blow it all up

13:48.584 --> 13:50.201
find something else.

13:51.542 --> 13:53.409
What do you propose?

13:55.584 --> 13:57.584
Let's go instead.

14:00.209 --> 14:02.451
- You could do that?
- Yes.

14:06.792 --> 14:08.227
It's okay.

14:08.251 --> 14:12.534
I'll speak to General Haig about it.
We will send you to Flanders.

14:13.459 --> 14:15.034
Thank my Lord.

14:16.584 --> 14:18.367
Get back to work.

14:34.626 --> 14:35.867
It's stupid.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.893
Sir, if he will allow me to explain.

14:38.917 --> 14:41.284
"Surprise the Boches?"

14:41.584 --> 14:44.143
I never imagined that it would involve

14:44.167 --> 14:46.284
untrained civilians.

14:46.751 --> 14:49.727
They are not soldiers, it is true,

14:49.751 --> 14:53.018
but it is not
they need to be.

14:53.042 --> 14:56.518
They have to dig. They know
how to do it, last year ...

14:56.542 --> 14:58.742
It doesn't matter where they dug!

14:59.834 --> 15:01.852
It is a military operation.

15:01.876 --> 15:05.352
It is not a social experiment.

15:05.376 --> 15:09.352
If it fails, the effort
war will be lost, don't you see?

15:09.376 --> 15:13.492
I must admit that I
I also have my reservations.

15:13.751 --> 15:16.326
Our infantry will make them yield.

15:16.667 --> 15:20.227
We have to continue
pressing, over and over.

15:20.251 --> 15:22.268
But at what cost, General?

15:22.292 --> 15:24.768
A war is won by numbers.

15:24.792 --> 15:28.727
We have the advantage of numbers
and we will defeat the Germans.

15:28.751 --> 15:30.867
This is how we win.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.201
My answer is no.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.076
It can be undone.

15:35.376 --> 15:38.518
With all due respect, the
horse era is over.

15:38.542 --> 15:41.935
It's that of armored vehicles.
We have to change

15:41.959 --> 15:44.893
and quickly, or we will revive
the Battle of the Somme.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.435
The smell of blood will rise again

15:46.459 --> 15:49.768
to England.
Lloyd George will not be happy.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.227
Heads will fall.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.826
A race awaits you
very promising.

15:55.167 --> 15:57.518
- Think carefully.
- It is done.

15:57.542 --> 16:00.852
This is our best
option, I assure you.

16:00.876 --> 16:06.784
Do you personally answer for
these sewer workers?

16:09.001 --> 16:12.560
Of course Mr.
And if they are not up to the task,

16:12.584 --> 16:15.159
take my salary
and send me to the front.

16:15.751 --> 16:17.742
But give me four months.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.534
You will have your answer.

16:22.376 --> 16:23.576
Very well.

16:24.209 --> 16:27.826
Two months and not a minute more.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.227
I can add...

16:30.251 --> 16:31.935
My decision is made, Archie.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.852
Jack and his men
they will be under his command.

16:33.876 --> 16:37.034
- I'd like the record.
- Indicated.

16:38.751 --> 16:42.701
Thank you both for your help.
Keep me informed.

16:43.292 --> 16:44.701
Jack,

16:45.459 --> 16:47.352
don't ruin it all.

16:47.376 --> 16:48.784
Mister.

17:09.459 --> 17:13.451
If you want to carry these
cavemen in front,

17:13.666 --> 17:18.076
you will bear the consequences.
Keep them on track.

17:18.916 --> 17:21.117
Put them online

17:21.584 --> 17:24.409
And keep them out of my way

17:27.166 --> 17:28.409
Understood?

17:28.667 --> 17:30.492
Perfectly, sir.

17:57.126 --> 17:58.935
Two months will go by quickly.

17:58.959 --> 18:01.143
A bullet goes fast too.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.268
You will miss mom's birthday.

18:03.292 --> 18:04.643
She can come with me.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.742
She will scare the Boches.

18:09.751 --> 18:11.076
Jane ...

18:11.917 --> 18:14.518
It is my duty. My responsability.

18:14.542 --> 18:17.201
Your responsibility
is to be with your family.

18:17.876 --> 18:20.977
Because you?
Don't they have minors?

18:21.001 --> 18:22.451
It is not that easy.

18:22.834 --> 18:26.659
You have to know how to dig clay.
They say we are experts.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.768
I am useful for once.

18:29.792 --> 18:33.117
When I come back, I will send the
old Rodgers for a walk.

18:33.917 --> 18:36.352
The army will offer me
a real job.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.352
- And a salary ...
- How stupid you can be!

18:39.376 --> 18:41.518
Don't be ashamed of what you do.

18:41.542 --> 18:44.102
This busybody doesn't know your life.

18:44.126 --> 18:45.492
Jane

18:48.417 --> 18:50.784
I am not doing this blindly.

18:52.126 --> 18:54.701
Everything to me
matter is here.

18:55.709 --> 18:58.393
I protect this house, no
I dare to imagine

18:58.417 --> 19:00.659
what would happen otherwise.

19:02.542 --> 19:06.076
You will be proud of me.
I promise you.

19:07.792 --> 19:09.893
Every week I
meeting with a woman

19:09.917 --> 19:13.076
that she is proud of her late husband.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.367
Not.

19:19.584 --> 19:21.034
I'm coming.

19:44.459 --> 19:46.242
How is the infantry?

19:48.751 --> 19:50.659
I'll lend you a hand?

19:51.501 --> 19:53.617
You will come back?

19:54.459 --> 19:57.526
Sure.
Why do you ask me that?

19:58.851 --> 20:00.492
Uncle David didn't come back.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.409
It's not the same, son.

20:04.792 --> 20:08.185
I had to do a job
that he had never done.

20:08.209 --> 20:11.367
It turned out bad. He was unlucky.

20:11.792 --> 20:16.617
Mine is different.
I'm going to dig there, that's all.

20:16.876 --> 20:18.477
Do you know how to dig well?

20:18.501 --> 20:20.117
Yes very good.

20:20.792 --> 20:23.159
You don't need to worry.

20:25.167 --> 20:27.867
I can't make it last.

20:29.001 --> 20:31.826
Let's see how we can fix this.

20:32.334 --> 20:35.143
Are you going to ride a horse?

20:35.167 --> 20:36.367
Not.

20:36.917 --> 20:40.159
I will be in a special room.
Top secret.

20:40.834 --> 20:44.227
I'll have a uniform and everything.
You can put it on.

20:44.251 --> 20:45.492
And medals?

20:46.626 --> 20:48.060
Many medals.

20:48.084 --> 20:51.492
When I get home,
I'll be decorated like a tree

20:53.167 --> 20:54.617
And there you have it.

20:55.709 --> 20:57.117
It's repaired.

21:15.584 --> 21:17.992
Come on, let's get to work!

21:19.001 --> 21:20.951
Hurry up!

21:33.292 --> 21:35.643
Sorry, we just arrived.

21:35.667 --> 21:38.076
Good for you. Y?

21:38.709 --> 21:40.935
We don't know where we should go.

21:40.959 --> 21:42.159
Your documents?

21:49.751 --> 21:52.185
You are with Hellfire Jack.

21:52.209 --> 21:53.268
Who?

21:53.292 --> 21:55.826
Colonel Norton Griffiths.
Section 3.

21:57.292 --> 21:58.492
Section 3!

22:04.459 --> 22:06.867
Come, I'll accompany you.

22:08.542 --> 22:12.852
The trench system is simple.
There are three main lines:

22:12.876 --> 22:15.268
reserve, support and shot.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.435
There are the trenches
Communication

22:17.459 --> 22:19.159
connecting the lines.

22:37.501 --> 22:38.935
A mixture of shit, urine

22:38.959 --> 22:41.977
cordite and rot.
It is unique.

22:42.001 --> 22:45.284
Do not worry,
you will get used to it.

22:48.376 --> 22:49.784
Hello, old man!

22:53.001 --> 22:55.367
The Boches are aggressive this morning.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.451
- Are you okay, boy?
- Yes.

22:59.792 --> 23:02.784
Do not worry,
you will get used to it.

23:05.876 --> 23:08.201
Here we are.

23:10.751 --> 23:12.742
This is the Great War.

23:17.167 --> 23:19.810
The water is chlorinated.
It's weird at first.

23:19.834 --> 23:22.659
Yes, I know, I'll get used to it.

23:23.126 --> 23:25.701
Thank you Captain.
I'll take care.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.992
Bill, it's good to see you all here.

23:31.376 --> 23:34.977
- Some already regret it.
- But there you are.

23:35.001 --> 23:39.435
We start and send you back
to England quickly. Come see it.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.784
Harold, I have to go ... See?

23:42.917 --> 23:45.685
You just have to tie a knot.
Can't you hold back?

23:45.709 --> 23:47.810
No, I'm going to get over it.

23:47.834 --> 23:49.909
So hurry up.

23:50.292 --> 23:51.768
Look, at 12 p.m.

23:51.792 --> 23:53.701
What are we looking at?

23:55.917 --> 23:57.527
There is not much.

23:57.551 --> 24:01.742
But that's ours
target, about 320 m from here.

24:02.917 --> 24:06.060
It was a farm.
The Boches use it

24:06.084 --> 24:09.909
like a machine gun pole.
They dug deep.

24:23.251 --> 24:25.742
- Officer on approach.
- Attention.

24:27.417 --> 24:28.617
Mister.

24:31.001 --> 24:32.242
Jack.

24:33.167 --> 24:38.143
So here it is
the good team of him, right?

24:38.167 --> 24:39.951
My clay excavators.

24:40.917 --> 24:43.727
What is this show?

24:43.751 --> 24:45.352
Get up, little one!

24:45.376 --> 24:48.143
We don't lean on each other.
We stand up.

24:48.167 --> 24:51.685
You wear the uniform of the
King, be worthy of him.

24:51.709 --> 24:55.102
An idiot had disappeared
from the town, so did you come?

24:55.126 --> 24:56.685
The farm!

24:56.709 --> 25:01.076
The enemy will
laugh before he shoots you.

25:12.709 --> 25:13.909
Shit...

25:17.834 --> 25:19.034
His name from him?

25:19.709 --> 25:22.326
Hawkin. William Hawkin, sir.

25:22.917 --> 25:25.117
And you are the head

25:25.709 --> 25:29.117
of that group, Hawkin?

25:29.542 --> 25:31.102
Yes sir.

25:31.126 --> 25:32.617
Impressive.

25:34.459 --> 25:37.117
You will be responsible
of his actions.

25:41.709 --> 25:44.518
Keep them away
of the royal soldiers.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.977
They don't need this circus.

25:47.001 --> 25:49.393
- With due respect...
- Shut up!

25:49.417 --> 25:52.518
Wait for us to talk to you
to talk, do you understand?

25:52.542 --> 25:54.935
- Yes sir.
-He's a sergeant.

25:54.959 --> 25:56.435
Yes, sergeant.

25:56.459 --> 25:58.701
Everything will be fine, Lord.

25:59.042 --> 26:00.742
Good talk.

26:02.751 --> 26:05.893
- I'm sorry friend.
- Friend?

26:05.917 --> 26:09.643
I don't think we breed
the pigs together.

26:09.667 --> 26:12.268
Friend? I'm a sergeant. Say it.

26:12.292 --> 26:14.326
- Sergeant.
- Stronger!

26:15.209 --> 26:16.867
Fool!

26:18.584 --> 26:20.909
One more time Jack

26:21.084 --> 26:23.617
you have a good team.

26:23.917 --> 26:25.617
They are the best.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.852
This idiot thinks

26:32.876 --> 26:35.268
that he can bear
10 tons of shit.

26:35.292 --> 26:37.492
- They're not thinking about Eton.
- Not.

26:39.417 --> 26:41.326
32 degrees over 100 meters.

26:41.792 --> 26:43.768
Minus 10 for the rest.

26:43.792 --> 26:45.060
There is work.

26:45.084 --> 26:47.852
We better shake our buttocks.

26:47.876 --> 26:50.701
I would not like to be
chef right now.

26:53.376 --> 26:55.727
Lord, you who are our Shepherd.

26:55.751 --> 26:57.393
Stop for a bit.

26:57.417 --> 27:00.201
- Are you listening to us here?
- It's tradition.

27:02.417 --> 27:04.492
Go ahead, St. George.

27:06.501 --> 27:10.034
Deliver us from evil and
protect our souls.

27:12.376 --> 27:13.742
Shorty.

27:36.917 --> 27:40.492

28:02.501 --> 28:03.977

22:22.376 --> 22:25.284
We can rest. Relax.

22:26.709 --> 22:27.992
Yes...

22:28.209 --> 22:29.992
Absolute relaxation.

22:30.751 --> 22:32.992
We reached the support line.

22:33.209 --> 22:35.034
What is that smell?

22:35.334 --> 22:37.477
- You fucking bastard!

I look like I'm 60 years old.

29:47.042 --> 29:49.701
- It could be worse.
- Like this?

29:50.084 --> 29:53.492
I do not know.
That's what they say, right?

29:53.917 --> 29:55.701
Let's go guys.

29:55.876 --> 29:57.567
We are losing time.

30:29.667 --> 30:32.477
That bastard me
attacks every day.

30:32.501 --> 30:34.602
Who would kill a guy in the bathroom?

30:34.626 --> 30:36.534
Someone who knows you.

30:37.251 --> 30:39.784
If it is not him, it will be someone else.

30:40.417 --> 30:43.784
Don't take it personally.
We will be leaving soon.

30:44.584 --> 30:46.018
What do we have left?

30:46.042 --> 30:48.034
About 40 meters.

30:49.417 --> 30:52.659
We take note of his position,
We pop and backtrack

31:22.459 --> 31:24.435
That's 200.

31:24.459 --> 31:26.893
We dig, we put the bombs

31:26.917 --> 31:28.284
and we finished.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.852
God blessed!

31:35.876 --> 31:37.284
Suck on it, it will soften.

31:38.292 --> 31:40.852
They look like cookies
baby, but tough.

31:40.876 --> 31:43.643
- They're dog biscuits.
- What?

31:43.667 --> 31:46.810
No i've been eating it
since I am here.

31:46.834 --> 31:50.643
I've had staff since
that he was small, I know.

31:50.667 --> 31:53.102
That's it, real shit.

31:53.126 --> 31:57.409
But they tasted good.
This is a dog biscuit.

32:03.084 --> 32:04.784
Shit...

32:05.126 --> 32:06.617
He was very close.

32:07.876 --> 32:09.159
That, even more.

32:26.834 --> 32:28.727
Everything will collapse!

32:28.751 --> 32:30.034
Support the walls!

32:34.792 --> 32:35.992
Shit!

32:36.042 --> 32:37.352
Outside!

32:37.376 --> 32:38.909
Salt!

32:50.042 --> 32:51.867
Is everyone okay?

32:54.751 --> 32:57.284
- George?
- Yes, I'm OK.

32:57.626 --> 32:59.076
How are you?

33:00.626 --> 33:02.326
Charlie, are you okay?

33:03.459 --> 33:04.742
Charlie?

33:06.417 --> 33:08.117
No, that does not work.

33:09.126 --> 33:12.367
Not really
it was far this time.

33:16.542 --> 33:19.576
Your prayers were
helpful, Georgie ...

33:20.292 --> 33:21.826
You're still alive.

33:23.584 --> 33:26.227
Did you imagine it like that, Bill?

33:26.251 --> 33:28.284
I don't know what I was imagining.

33:29.001 --> 33:30.201
Me, it wasn't that.

33:33.126 --> 33:35.659
I received a card from
Maggie this morning.

33:36.876 --> 33:40.326
The goose fair has started.
She saw the ...

33:40.959 --> 33:43.326
the tiers of the apples of love.

33:45.542 --> 33:48.826
I went there all
years, without exception.

33:51.792 --> 33:53.742
I would like to go.

33:58.792 --> 34:00.242
Sounds like fun.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.742
We will go next year.

34:05.251 --> 34:06.784
All together.

34:07.501 --> 34:10.367
Yes I'd like to.

34:14.458 --> 34:16.826
How do you know the taste
of dog biscuits?

34:17.208 --> 34:19.617
- Have you ever tried it?
- I'm not a dog.

34:19.876 --> 34:23.867
Now it's done.
They are dog biscuits.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.034
Bill,

34:30.292 --> 34:31.601
What do you think?

34:31.626 --> 34:34.951
It's not going to happen
on its own, come on.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.951
We will be home soon.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.701
Go ahead.

34:53.667 --> 34:54.867
Bill.

34:55.583 --> 34:57.727
I just want good news.

34:57.551 --> 34:59.659
We achieved the goal.

35:00.334 --> 35:03.117
Just below the
German machine gun.

35:04.334 --> 35:06.117
Congratulations.

35:07.292 --> 35:10.143
Covers denotation
with a mortar attack.

35:10.167 --> 35:12.909
- Headquarters instructions.
- Well.

35:14.459 --> 35:16.060
Can we reconfirm

35:16.084 --> 35:19.326
the coordinates?
We will only have one chance.

35:19.917 --> 35:22.034
Of course, I send someone.

35:23.376 --> 35:24.742
Well.

35:34.792 --> 35:36.268
Baker, Marshall.

35:36.292 --> 35:39.992
I have a mission for you.
No man's land tonight.

35:46.292 --> 35:48.060
Slowly.

35:48.084 --> 35:50.034
Are you going to shut it up?

35:50.376 --> 35:52.367
How many times have I done this?

35:53.084 --> 35:55.602
Woodsy, can you smell something?

35:55.626 --> 35:57.909
It stinks of sewers.

36:00.709 --> 36:04.867
I'm sick of your behavior.
I do not understand.

36:07.626 --> 36:09.826
Put yourself in their shoes.

36:10.542 --> 36:12.201
They don't know us.

36:14.959 --> 36:17.227
Do you know the story
by Private King?

36:17.251 --> 36:18.451
No, thanks.

36:24.626 --> 36:26.076
Little bastard...

36:28.709 --> 36:30.701
- Soldier King ...
- Enough.

36:31.042 --> 36:34.852
Private King is 19 years old.

36:34.876 --> 36:36.768
Just come to the front.

36:36.792 --> 36:39.701
Troops move
between two trenches.

36:40.292 --> 36:43.393
They have been walking for hours.

36:43.417 --> 36:46.393
Suddenly King
wants to go shit.

36:46.417 --> 36:48.367
He can do more.

36:49.042 --> 36:51.977
Ask your
top whatwho accepts.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.185
He told himself that he would catch up with them.

36:54.209 --> 36:57.076
He walks away, does his thing.

36:57.709 --> 37:00.268
Night falls on the forest.

37:00.292 --> 37:02.492
He is looking for his troop.

37:03.251 --> 37:05.534
But he is in the wrong direction.

37:06.334 --> 37:08.034
In the morning,

37:08.834 --> 37:11.185
the soldiers stop him.

37:11.209 --> 37:13.784
- By desertion?
- Yes.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.977
He claims his innocence.

37:18.001 --> 37:21.352
"I had gone to shit,
ask my boss. "

37:21.376 --> 37:25.518
But the problem is
that his boss is dead.

37:25.542 --> 37:28.659
A sniper will
he fired an hour earlier.

37:29.084 --> 37:31.659
Nobody can
confirm the version of him,

37:31.834 --> 37:35.310
the council of war
declares him guilty.

37:35.334 --> 37:38.393
We sell you the
eyes and we execute it.

37:38.417 --> 37:40.451
He falls into anonymity and it's over.

37:40.917 --> 37:43.977
You disappear and
you look like a coward.

37:44.001 --> 37:48.909
No you could also leave
let the Boches do the work.

37:49.459 --> 37:52.742
We call you hero
and you have a medal.

37:53.709 --> 37:54.909
Hears.

37:55.792 --> 37:59.227
If the soldiers we
they hate, I don't care.

37:59.251 --> 38:01.576
On the one hand, they run the
risk of being shot.

38:02.001 --> 38:03.576
And on the other

38:03.792 --> 38:08.326
some bastards execute a
child because he has gone to shit.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.742
How many medals will we have?

38:16.751 --> 38:19.102
They don't give them to guys like us.

38:19.126 --> 38:23.034
They give them to
ass licking, guys like that.

38:23.167 --> 38:25.159
Are you laughing at me?

38:25.584 --> 38:26.992
It is like in the field.

38:27.209 --> 38:29.268
The little ones do the work and

38:29.292 --> 38:33.076
the officers harvest the
laurels when all is well.

38:33.251 --> 38:34.893
What if it goes wrong?

38:34.917 --> 38:38.060
It works both ways.
You are pampering yourself.

38:38.084 --> 38:39.617
This is life.

38:41.001 --> 38:43.951
If you do your best
effort, you won't do better.

38:46.001 --> 38:47.201
You are a poet.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.810
Are the coordinates correct?

38:50.834 --> 38:53.768
Hellfire sent two
guys to no man's land.

38:53.792 --> 38:55.060
It is confirmed.

38:55.084 --> 38:56.992
Nice job.

38:57.584 --> 39:00.102
The mortar attack
It will be 7:20 a.m. at 7:30 a.m.

39:00.126 --> 39:03.242
- You'll have a lot of time.
- Yes.

39:04.501 --> 39:08.117
Excellent. You know
what are you going to achieve?

39:09.459 --> 39:11.451
We'll see when it's done.

39:13.126 --> 39:14.477
Very well.

39:14.501 --> 39:16.034
Very well.

39:18.292 --> 39:19.826
Go for it.

39:58.334 --> 40:01.784
- What's that noise?
- Do you live in a cave?

40:02.167 --> 40:06.409
The poor man has been sent to
locate a machine gun post.

40:07.042 --> 40:10.810
-He's been trapped for two days.
- They haven't come back?

40:10.834 --> 40:11.935
Only one returned.

40:11.959 --> 40:13.159
Gentlemen.

40:16.001 --> 40:17.185
Where's Bill?

40:17.209 --> 40:18.951
What are you doing?

40:19.334 --> 40:21.242
According to you?

40:22.751 --> 40:25.143
Do not be silly.

40:25.167 --> 40:26.867
Stockford, you're replacing him.

40:27.251 --> 40:29.492
- Go.
- Yes sir.

40:53.667 --> 40:57.076
If you go there, you are a man
dead, do you understand?

40:59.376 --> 41:00.935
It's crazy.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.159
Waiting!

41:22.126 --> 41:23.326
Help me.

41:23.376 --> 41:25.867
- Please.
- Everything will be fine, man.

41:26.126 --> 41:28.034
I'll get you out of here.

42:11.751 --> 42:13.852
Everything will be fine.

42:13.876 --> 42:15.242
It's good.

42:17.084 --> 42:19.977
You should check your sanity.

42:20.001 --> 42:21.409
It is for chefs.

42:22.376 --> 42:23.909
Well done!

42:25.501 --> 42:28.435
Following this morning's mission,

42:28.459 --> 42:32.060
the Headquarters
decided it was necessary

42:32.084 --> 42:35.576
tunnels are expanded.

42:36.209 --> 42:40.060
We will continue for
the Messines ridge.

42:40.084 --> 42:41.909
As planned.

42:42.834 --> 42:44.034
Excellent news.

42:46.667 --> 42:48.117
That's.

42:49.292 --> 42:50.576
Did you ask for me?

42:52.167 --> 42:53.826
Yes, Hawkin, just a second.

42:56.001 --> 42:57.492
Well.

43:01.584 --> 43:02.867
Go on, Jack.

43:06.376 --> 43:07.826
Hawkin.

43:20.959 --> 43:24.117
Are we going to dig under
from the Messines ridge?

43:24.626 --> 43:27.185
Yes, but it no longer concerns you.

43:27.209 --> 43:28.909
But it is 300 m.

43:29.834 --> 43:33.867
Thanks to you, we know how to do it.
Teams have been formed.

43:34.709 --> 43:37.018
What is your experience?

43:37.042 --> 43:40.393
Send men
incompetent is irresponsible.

43:40.417 --> 43:42.492
Irresponsible, really?

43:44.084 --> 43:46.268
Do you like your getaway this morning?

43:46.292 --> 43:50.310
Save a man's life
It is the mission of a soldier.

43:50.334 --> 43:52.477
A soldier obeys orders.

43:52.501 --> 43:55.602
He won't be a hero
In crops of nobody.

43:55.626 --> 43:57.727
The little one was
there for us.

43:57.551 --> 43:59.643
He was checking our coordinates.

43:59.667 --> 44:02.393
Men all die
the days obeying orders.

44:02.417 --> 44:05.242
It is not pretty, but it is necessary.

44:05.876 --> 44:09.602
They fight and I know
fall in love with each other

44:09.626 --> 44:12.742
not by a slap on
the back or a medal.

44:15.042 --> 44:17.076
It is good that you go.

44:27.001 --> 44:29.034
You have done your part.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.409
Time to go home.

44:31.876 --> 44:33.992
I'll do a good report on you.

44:38.251 --> 44:39.826
We observe the tunnels.

44:40.042 --> 44:42.867
We heard them itching.

44:43.334 --> 44:46.201
It seems that the Germans
they are also digging.

44:59.584 --> 45:01.435
Harry, where is your bag?

45:01.459 --> 45:03.893
I didn't see the point of wearing it.

45:03.917 --> 45:06.977
Logistics says that
trains can be late.

45:07.001 --> 45:11.102
The french take
those intended for us.

45:11.126 --> 45:15.201
Well ... we'll have to find
something to take care of, then.

45:23.834 --> 45:26.242
Three hours, damn it.

45:28.292 --> 45:31.034
Calm down, Charlie, it's going to happen.

45:37.917 --> 45:40.451
I know you since
20 years ago, Bill.

45:40.709 --> 45:43.643
I read in you how
in an open book.

45:43.667 --> 45:44.810
Y?

45:44.834 --> 45:48.143
I know when you are going to say "we are
digging "," let's have a beer "

45:48.167 --> 45:50.143
or "we haven't finished the job."

45:50.167 --> 45:52.102
We haven't finished the job.

45:52.126 --> 45:53.893
Hellfire says yes.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.951
- We did our part.
- I know, short.

45:57.167 --> 45:59.893
But without us
they will not be able to do it.

45:59.917 --> 46:03.393
Without a tunnel, there is no bomb.
It means years of war

46:03.417 --> 46:07.018
and thousands of unnecessary deaths.
We could even lose.

46:07.042 --> 46:10.367
- We do not know.
- Yes we do.

46:11.834 --> 46:14.992
I did well not
take my bag, huh?

46:15.334 --> 46:17.451
Where are you going, Harry?

46:21.167 --> 46:24.492
Hellfire said there was a
new team of miners.

46:25.167 --> 46:27.518
They were shown
how to dig clay.

46:27.542 --> 46:30.076
And do you think they will get there?

46:30.376 --> 46:31.951
If your life or

46:32.126 --> 46:34.685
the life of your family
depended on it,

46:34.709 --> 46:36.909
Would you trust them?

46:37.167 --> 46:38.951
I do not believe it.

46:39.917 --> 46:41.060
What's wrong with it?

46:41.084 --> 46:42.768
Bill has gone crazy.

46:42.792 --> 46:45.034
Harry returns to the front.

46:46.042 --> 46:48.909
Are you trying
show them something?

46:49.209 --> 46:50.742
In Fielding.

46:52.834 --> 46:55.951
Fuck Fielding
and fuck Haig.

46:57.001 --> 46:59.992
I think of men
that they don't care.

47:00.376 --> 47:02.117
Those who look like us.

47:02.542 --> 47:06.352
I hope nobody has
than to see such a place again.

47:06.376 --> 47:08.727
For that, you have to
finish the work.

47:08.751 --> 47:11.784
And we are the only ones
that we can do it.

47:12.417 --> 47:13.742
Shorty?

47:20.626 --> 47:23.367
- It is not true...
- You're not talking seriously?

47:25.251 --> 47:28.602
I want to go home.
I just want to go home.

47:28.626 --> 47:31.893
Come home, Charlie, don't you
we are forcing you to do nothing.

47:31.917 --> 47:33.617
We do not force you to do anything.

47:34.542 --> 47:37.617
What if we stay?
No, I say it like this ...

47:37.959 --> 47:40.477
It will take 6 months
to dig this tunnel.

47:40.501 --> 47:42.534
The Germans know we're going.

47:44.251 --> 47:46.742
Yes, I know, George.

47:50.001 --> 47:53.284
No, it's stupid.
We are there, we are going home.

47:54.376 --> 47:56.951
If that damn train ends up passing.

48:00.584 --> 48:02.326
You know what I'm going to say.

48:03.376 --> 48:05.076
Are you kidding?

48:06.251 --> 48:08.159
We are not staying.

48:10.001 --> 48:11.826
George, please.

48:13.417 --> 48:15.451
You don't have to stay.

48:16.876 --> 48:19.034
I am sure they will understand.

48:29.084 --> 48:30.659
See you soon, Charlie.

48:35.667 --> 48:37.367
I am not staying.

48:38.084 --> 48:39.909
Idiots.

49:01.584 --> 49:03.367
<i>"Jane, my love,</i>

49:04.501 --> 49:07.951
<i>"I told you that my
return was imminent,</i>

49:08.251 --> 49:11.185
<i>"but war makes us
break our promises.</i>

49:11.209 --> 49:15.034
<i>"The truth is that my return
It is further away than ever.</i>

49:15.751 --> 49:18.935
<i>“In recent months, the
time has passed slowly.</i>

49:18.959 --> 49:22.810
<i>"Our tunnels are getting closer
slowly to the german lines</i>

49:22.834 --> 49:25.102
<i>"by the major
history blast.</i>

49:25.126 --> 49:28.451
<i>"We are the only ones
that we can do it.</i>

49:29.042 --> 49:31.242
<i>"We are moving slowly.</i>

49:31.501 --> 49:34.117
<i>"We hear the tunnels
enemies all the time.</i>

49:34.667 --> 49:37.201
<i>"We pray that
don't find us.</i>

49:39.209 --> 49:41.727
<i>"When a soldier dies, we say</i>

49:41.751 --> 49:45.018
<i>"that he was a patriot.
The more the war progress</i>

49:45.042 --> 49:48.201
<i>"and the more I
the patriots surround ".</i>

49:49.209 --> 49:52.159
- Then?
- I think I hear ...

50:12.084 --> 50:13.617
Excuse me, ma'am?

50:14.084 --> 50:16.742
I'm afraid i am
bearer of bad news.

50:17.667 --> 50:19.409
Her husband ...

50:20.376 --> 50:23.367
I can get you a chair.

50:24.001 --> 50:25.201
Mrs. Brown?

50:25.709 --> 50:27.018
Not.

50:27.042 --> 50:29.268
- No chair?
- Not.

50:29.292 --> 50:31.268
I'm not Mrs. Brown.

50:31.292 --> 50:34.951
I am Mrs. Hawkin.
Sarah Brown is at number 4.

50:36.834 --> 50:39.409
Damn, sorry.

50:41.709 --> 50:43.492
Just leave me...

50:43.917 --> 50:46.576
Yes, it says number 14.

50:46.876 --> 50:49.659
I am terribly confused.

50:50.001 --> 50:53.159
Thanks for your time.
I am sorry.

51:23.084 --> 51:25.477
Marshal Haig, in
the infinite wisdom of him,

51:25.501 --> 51:26.992
Put a date.

51:28.376 --> 51:31.977
- June 7th. It is in 3 months.
- 3 months?

51:32.001 --> 51:35.143
But not really
we progress rapidly.

51:35.167 --> 51:38.518
- It's not negotiable, sorry.
- There are too many people.

51:38.542 --> 51:42.935
Since the Germans have
been here, we face daily.

51:42.959 --> 51:47.076
We spend more time
avoiding them than moving forward.

51:49.292 --> 51:50.701
Very well.

51:51.876 --> 51:53.576
Dig deeper.

51:54.001 --> 51:57.018
Under the layer of clay
blue, the Boches will not go.

51:57.042 --> 52:00.518
It is impossible.
Here is our current position.

52:00.542 --> 52:01.909
Messines is located here.

52:02.959 --> 52:04.727
If we go deeper,
we will pass by there.

52:04.751 --> 52:06.826
That's 100 more m to cover.

52:07.792 --> 52:11.492
- We do not have time.
- Staying here is suicide.

52:11.709 --> 52:13.810
You will meet the Germans.

52:13.834 --> 52:16.310
I refuse to lose
a ninth team.

52:16.334 --> 52:17.951
I agree.

52:18.542 --> 52:22.201
But if we kill each other, no
there will be no one left to lose.

52:23.834 --> 52:28.284
We can only go on
hoping to be lucky.

52:28.667 --> 52:32.117
I don't like having to
depend on luck.

52:42.417 --> 52:43.909
Take this.

52:47.042 --> 52:48.451
Just in case.

52:58.251 --> 53:00.909
Bill, if you succeed,

53:01.876 --> 53:05.768
could turn the tide of
war. No more trenches.

53:05.792 --> 53:09.409
We will walk over Berlin.
It could be thanks to you.

53:18.459 --> 53:19.909
Are you okay, Charlie?

53:21.292 --> 53:24.159
I haven't heard from Maggie
for a few weeks.

53:24.751 --> 53:26.242
She worries me a little.

53:30.834 --> 53:32.810
I'm sure she's fine.

53:32.834 --> 53:36.659
She has to run the business.
She takes care of him as much as Rodgers.

53:37.709 --> 53:39.117
It must be that.

53:42.584 --> 53:44.159
It's funny isn't it?

53:44.751 --> 53:46.201
What?

53:47.167 --> 53:49.326
Well with us

53:49.959 --> 53:53.909
when he receives a letter, no
It's very important. But here...

53:59.167 --> 54:03.867
When I see the postman again
on Applegate Street, I'll greet you.

54:04.126 --> 54:05.701
Actually.

54:09.042 --> 54:12.367
- Am I getting carried away
too much for her? - Not.

54:14.626 --> 54:16.367
Of course not.

54:16.667 --> 54:17.951
Because...

54:19.209 --> 54:21.284
I like very much.

54:25.792 --> 54:28.326
A new day
under the sun, gentlemen?

56:22.834 --> 56:24.034
Take things.

56:41.542 --> 56:43.034
Run!

56:48.459 --> 56:50.727
I have to admit
that you were right.

56:50.751 --> 56:54.310
Would you put it in writing for me?
How much should we get off?

56:54.334 --> 56:57.643
To pass under
of them, 30 meters.

56:57.667 --> 57:00.435
- But we will have other problems.
- Which?

57:00.459 --> 57:05.227
The composition of the soil will change.
We will be below sea level.

57:05.251 --> 57:08.477
There will be many
unpredictable things.

57:08.501 --> 57:12.060
Ground slides. Lost
of oxygen. We will need canaries

57:12.084 --> 57:14.034
to locate gas bags.

57:14.209 --> 57:16.159
Can you meet the deadlines?

57:16.709 --> 57:18.018
I do not know.

57:18.042 --> 57:20.951
We are the only ones who can do it.
We work day and night.

57:21.542 --> 57:23.435
It would take more.

57:23.459 --> 57:25.810
Focus on a single tunnel.

57:25.834 --> 57:28.060
Work more. You must be successful

57:28.084 --> 57:29.951
so sleep less.

57:52.959 --> 57:56.326
Standing. You are too ugly
to play Sleeping Beauty.

57:57.042 --> 57:59.326
Damn just
we close our eyes.

58:00.251 --> 58:01.810
We have a job to do.

58:01.834 --> 58:04.534
He hadn't asked to come back here.

58:07.459 --> 58:09.076
Listen Bill

58:10.084 --> 58:12.977
have worked hard and need
to rest. You too.

58:13.001 --> 58:15.643
We will rest when we finish.

58:15.667 --> 58:17.352
In a few weeks.

58:17.376 --> 58:20.326
No, look at them. Sight!

58:20.501 --> 58:24.060
They barely stand.
You wouldn't normally do that.

58:24.084 --> 58:26.159
We are not in normal times.

58:26.917 --> 58:28.768
As Hellfire said,

58:28.792 --> 58:31.701
if we fulfill our
mission, the war is over.

58:34.209 --> 58:35.409
Go.

58:35.751 --> 58:38.409
We'll meet
there in 5 minutes.

58:59.292 --> 59:01.534
One more bag and we're almost there.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.826
Did you smell something?

59:09.709 --> 59:11.784
I heard a creak.

59:35.001 --> 59:36.409
How are you?

59:39.126 --> 59:40.326
George, no!

59:50.917 --> 59:52.117
Stretcher carriers!

59:52.584 --> 59:54.076
Stretcher carriers!

01:00:02.626 --> 01:00:03.935
Stupid!

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:06.102
You're going to do what
kill us, I told you!

01:00:06.126 --> 01:00:08.659
Let go. Let go.

01:00:09.584 --> 01:00:11.409
They are going to shoot you.

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:17.935
This is what happens when
you leave the sewers behind

01:00:17.959 --> 01:00:19.810
playing soldiers.

01:00:19.834 --> 01:00:21.727
They are simply exhausted.

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:24.034
We are all exhausted.

01:00:24.376 --> 01:00:27.367
Insubordination
it is insubordination.

01:00:28.251 --> 01:00:31.117
Not even
try to justify yourself.

01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.602
I have no time
to lose, Jack.

01:00:33.626 --> 01:00:37.310
So you and your
deep trolls

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:40.602
apologize for
wasting time.

01:00:40.626 --> 01:00:42.768
This troll is called Stockford.

01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:45.060
And with all due respect,

01:00:45.084 --> 01:00:48.477
you can get in
the stick in your ass.

01:00:48.501 --> 01:00:50.018
Let go!

01:00:50.042 --> 01:00:51.534
Sergeant!

01:00:54.167 --> 01:00:56.935
Take that man and that

01:00:56.959 --> 01:00:59.518
and take them tothe picket line.

01:00:59.542 --> 01:01:01.227
For insubordination.

01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:02.685
Well. Your,

01:01:02.709 --> 01:01:04.867
get up, come on.

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:08.893
Go over there.
You, turn around.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:10.893
Stand next to him.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.637
Soon.
March forward!

01:01:12.959 --> 01:01:15.534
One, two, one, two ...

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:20.159
Left Right,
Left Right...

01:01:25.042 --> 01:01:27.742
Soldiers, stop!

01:01:30.834 --> 01:01:33.435
Hawkin, against that
door, in front of me.

01:01:33.459 --> 01:01:36.076
Stockford, against
that door in front of me.

01:01:36.709 --> 01:01:38.435
Soldier, tie him up.

01:01:38.459 --> 01:01:40.034
Yes, sergeant.

01:01:42.417 --> 01:01:44.201
Extend your hands to me.

01:01:45.584 --> 01:01:48.034
- Squeeze, kid.
- Yes, sergeant.

01:01:50.626 --> 01:01:52.326
- Clever?
- Yes, sergeant.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:53.992
Survey.

01:02:00.959 --> 01:02:02.909
- Backup.
- Good, sergeant.

01:02:04.417 --> 01:02:06.826
Soldiers, turn around.

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:14.534
Go ahead, walk. Left Right...
We will return tomorrow morning.

01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:25.492
That arrogant jerk
with his cane ...

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:28.018
Is it his respect that
we want to get?

01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:29.602
Won't you stop

01:02:29.626 --> 01:02:31.518
No I'm serious.

01:02:31.542 --> 01:02:36.102
When I take low risks
Earth, I want to know why.

01:02:36.126 --> 01:02:38.352
We do not work for
him, but for Hellfire.

01:02:38.376 --> 01:02:40.060
I don't work for him.

01:02:40.084 --> 01:02:41.602
I dont trust him.

01:02:41.626 --> 01:02:44.185
I work for you, I trusted you.

01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:45.768
I never lied to you.

01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:47.893
You lie to yourself

01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:51.477
The great victory that
you wait, it won't take place.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.477
This war will drag on
whatever happens.

01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:57.893
But you do it because
when they question you in the country

01:02:57.917 --> 01:02:59.435
you can keep your head up.

01:02:59.459 --> 01:03:00.768
They are nonsense.

01:03:00.792 --> 01:03:02.867
Really? Really?

01:03:03.792 --> 01:03:07.435
I've lived long enough to know
that the only one capable of judging you

01:03:07.459 --> 01:03:09.992
he is the one who carries
your boots, Bill.

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.159
I'm just saying ...

01:03:17.501 --> 01:03:21.352
those who know you
they know what it costs you.

01:03:21.376 --> 01:03:24.534
I'm talking about Peter and Jane.

01:03:26.709 --> 01:03:28.034
And me.

01:03:28.876 --> 01:03:30.435
Sometimes.

01:03:30.459 --> 01:03:33.159
When you are not
a stubborn asshole.

01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:38.159
Damn...

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.617
It hurts, huh, Hawkin?

01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:02.518
Yes sir.

01:04:02.542 --> 01:04:04.617
The army does not tolerate
insubordination.

01:04:04.876 --> 01:04:07.367
Whatever the reasons.

01:04:08.167 --> 01:04:12.685
But I admire those who
they fight for their ideas,

01:04:12.709 --> 01:04:16.492
those who do not abandon a
dying on the battlefield.

01:04:37.376 --> 01:04:39.143
If you say that to someone,

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.435
I will gut you with my hands.

01:04:41.459 --> 01:04:44.451
And you will be doing
baths for a month.

01:04:45.292 --> 01:04:46.742
Yes, sergeant.

01:05:05.542 --> 01:05:07.143
What did Hellfire tell you?

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:09.617
You will find out very soon.

01:05:10.667 --> 01:05:13.352
- Does he work against the Germans?
- Probably not.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.034
We are running out of sausages.

01:05:22.292 --> 01:05:23.685
Thanks, sergeant.

01:05:23.709 --> 01:05:25.117
This will be it.

01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:27.492
Well, gentlemen ...

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:30.310
some rest
before the final offensive.

01:05:30.334 --> 01:05:32.826
We don't have time to
a vacation in Bognor,

01:05:33.334 --> 01:05:34.602
we will be satisfied with that.

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:36.326
We are more of football.

01:05:36.501 --> 01:05:37.701
Taking.

01:05:38.417 --> 01:05:41.034
- W.G. Grace gave it to me.
- Who is it?

01:05:42.459 --> 01:05:44.268
The best cricketer.

01:05:44.292 --> 01:05:46.143
-So he's good?
-Yes, he's fine.

01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:48.326
You at the counter.

01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:51.242
We do not smoke in the country.

01:05:52.834 --> 01:05:56.310
Okay, stay here and get
up to date with her. Hawkin, go to the bottom.

01:05:56.334 --> 01:05:57.643
George, in the middle.

01:05:57.667 --> 01:05:59.310
- Who wants to go bowling?
- whatEU?

01:05:59.334 --> 01:06:00.742
Who wants to pitch?

01:06:06.501 --> 01:06:08.227
- Mail for MacDonald.
- Which?

01:06:08.251 --> 01:06:11.492
- C.
- It was time for you to write to me.

01:06:11.751 --> 01:06:13.576
Come on, George, at bat.

01:06:13.876 --> 01:06:15.909
Hold it from the right side.

01:06:16.459 --> 01:06:17.810
Come on, hit her.

01:06:17.834 --> 01:06:20.534
Squeeze your legs, George.
Feet together.

01:06:25.584 --> 01:06:28.742
That's it, throw it out.
Eliminate it, come on!

01:06:30.126 --> 01:06:31.617
Well played.

01:06:32.709 --> 01:06:35.201
- It was a quick game.
- Charlie?

01:06:37.209 --> 01:06:38.409
Charlie!

01:06:39.376 --> 01:06:40.576
Hey Charlie!

01:06:58.292 --> 01:06:59.810
Charlie, no!

01:06:59.834 --> 01:07:03.409
- Get away.
- What are you doing? Short!

01:07:05.459 --> 01:07:07.768
- OMG!
- Not!

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:09.076
Charlie!

01:07:09.834 --> 01:07:11.992
No, no, Charlie!

01:07:33.459 --> 01:07:35.076
No Charlie!

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:01.034
OMG...

01:08:23.334 --> 01:08:25.158
<i>"My dear Jane,</i>

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:28.992

01:09:51.001 --> 01:09:53.810
<i>"I send you all my
love to you and Peter.</i>

01:09:53.834 --> 01:09:56.867
<i>"I am yours forever.
William. "</i>

01:10:15.292 --> 01:10:17.701
I couldn't make one
oxygen test.

01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:20.310
We will have to go like this.

01:10:20.334 --> 01:10:22.867
Okay, I have it all planned out.

01:10:28.834 --> 01:10:29.893
What is it?

01:10:29.917 --> 01:10:33.310
The army no longer had
canary, I had to improvise.

01:10:33.334 --> 01:10:35.867
Say hello to Fielding Junior.

01:10:36.751 --> 01:10:38.768
-He seems dead.
-He is not dead.

01:10:38.792 --> 01:10:41.185
He's drunk. They gave him rum.

01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:43.560
While we watch it
breathe is good.

01:10:43.584 --> 01:10:46.143
Does Fielding take away our
minors and replace them

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:49.159
by drunk rats?
He seems fair.

01:10:49.834 --> 01:10:52.742
If he's finished debating
local wildlife ...

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:55.159
Rest

01:10:57.542 --> 01:10:59.201
I am very proud.

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:03.117
Very proud of each of you.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.576
Your conviction.

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:08.617
Your courage in the face of adversity.

01:11:09.167 --> 01:11:13.992
You have lived most of it
of your life underground, ignored.

01:11:14.584 --> 01:11:15.784
But tonight

01:11:16.959 --> 01:11:18.909
in a few hours,

01:11:19.584 --> 01:11:23.784
thousands of our men will be
slaughtered unless you succeed.

01:11:25.459 --> 01:11:28.409
It's not about being seen
good for the hierarchy,

01:11:29.792 --> 01:11:32.617
but to do something for
our men.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:38.076
Gentlemen.

01:11:39.167 --> 01:11:40.492
Tonight,974
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:44,034
maybe not
let's go down in history,

01:11:45.084 --> 01:11:47.867
But surely
We will change the geography.

01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:52.992
George.

01:11:55.292 --> 01:11:56.492
Shorty.

01:11:59.459 --> 01:12:00.701
Harold.

01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:12.242
- It was an honor.
- Thank my Lord.

01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:15.492
I was wrong about you, Bill.

01:12:15.834 --> 01:12:17.909
You are a true soldier.

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:29.826
3:00 a.m.
Three hours before the attack.

01:12:42.501 --> 01:12:43.784
Is the time.

01:12:52.292 --> 01:12:55.034
Listen They are very close.

01:13:08.959 --> 01:13:10.159
It's Harold.

01:13:10.792 --> 01:13:13.451
Shorty, you need to calm down.

01:13:14.084 --> 01:13:15.326
Correct.

01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:18.492
We need more bags.

01:13:36.209 --> 01:13:38.117
Wait wait wait...

01:13:38.417 --> 01:13:40.602
Everything is in your
Head, Shorty, get over it.

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:42.659
Wait a second.

01:13:57.251 --> 01:13:58.742
The way is clear.

01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:01.201
Jorge!

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.659
Come on, get up.

01:14:18.751 --> 01:14:21.435
If we find a tunnel
German, we have to blow it up.

01:14:21.459 --> 01:14:24.992
What if his gallery goes through the
bedroom? I have to check.

01:14:51.834 --> 01:14:53.076
Bill?

01:14:53.626 --> 01:14:55.492
Bring your ass here.

01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:09.518
It goes slightly to the west.

01:15:09.542 --> 01:15:11.185
The bedroom must remain intact.

01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:13.326
So let's blow it up.

01:15:14.001 --> 01:15:15.451
- Bill!
- Shit!

01:15:48.459 --> 01:15:49.659
Jorge!

01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:26.659
Let go of me!

01:16:27.334 --> 01:16:31.018
- But shit! The tunnel!
- It's over, Bill.

01:16:31.042 --> 01:16:33.617
Everything collapsed.

01:16:35.084 --> 01:16:37.268
The room is
intact, you have to go back.

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:40.784
No, it would take hours.
It's over, forget it.

01:16:41.167 --> 01:16:43.534
The whole gallery collapsed.

01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:48.201
The German tunnel.

01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:52.852
Part of his tunnel ran
along ours.

01:16:52.876 --> 01:16:55.852
No, no, the room
Collapsed!

01:16:55.876 --> 01:16:59.768
We find the point of convergence,
we drill and head to the bedroom.

01:16:59.792 --> 01:17:02.268
We will receive a hail of bullets.

01:17:02.292 --> 01:17:05.701
Your order will be to destroy it
and dig a new one.

01:17:05.917 --> 01:17:08.117
- They will think that we will
the same. -Not!

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:10.727
It's a suicide mission. Go alone.

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:13.143
We cannot delay the assault.

01:17:13.167 --> 01:17:16.685
At 6:30 a.m., our boys
they will head to certain death.

01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:18.826
Unless we go all the way.

01:17:20.876 --> 01:17:22.242
Not.

01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:29.617
Harry ...

01:17:30.459 --> 01:17:33.826
When you said i wasn't there
here to prove myself

01:17:34.584 --> 01:17:36.034
you were right.

01:17:37.292 --> 01:17:40.659
When you called me
Stubborn asshole, you were right.

01:17:41.876 --> 01:17:44.492
We are all so
good as a general.

01:17:44.959 --> 01:17:46.576
I should have seen it before.

01:17:47.084 --> 01:17:48.617
I am sorry.

01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:51.909
But here, the choice is simple.

01:17:53.042 --> 01:17:56.018
We can stay and
do nothing, surrender.

01:17:56.042 --> 01:17:58.409
For fear of failure.

01:17:58.542 --> 01:18:02.268
Or we can go back and
do what we came for.

01:18:02.292 --> 01:18:04.242
Not be heroes

01:18:04.417 --> 01:18:06.909
but because it is the only thing
what can be done.

01:18:10.376 --> 01:18:12.659
So, let's go get things.

01:18:14.876 --> 01:18:17.409
George, stay here.

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:20.143
I shouldn't have
forced to do this.

01:18:20.167 --> 01:18:21.643
Everything will be fine.

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.268
Was he okay during the fight?

01:18:23.292 --> 01:18:24.867
I am sorry.

01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:29.242
I couldn't ... it won't happen again.

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:34.326
We will do it together.

01:18:35.959 --> 01:18:37.159
Go.

01:18:43.626 --> 01:18:45.951
Well there are some who
they are having fun.

01:18:46.453 --> 01:18:50.853
5 am One hour before the attack.

01:20:04.376 --> 01:20:05.701
George ...

01:20:06.084 --> 01:20:08.393
He goes back to the intersection and watches.

01:20:08.417 --> 01:20:10.492
If he moves, let us know.

01:20:49.042 --> 01:20:50.742
He brings the material.

01:21:00.209 --> 01:21:02.143
We have 15 minutes
for connections.

01:21:02.167 --> 01:21:04.034
And 10 to go.

01:21:32.251 --> 01:21:33.451
Bill.

01:21:35.042 --> 01:21:37.643
- Where?
- I dont know. Many places.

01:21:37.667 --> 01:21:40.951
- Depth?
- Above us, I think.

01:21:41.376 --> 01:21:42.784
We follow the plan.

01:21:44.126 --> 01:21:45.326
I warn George.

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.659
Forget it, we have too much work.

01:23:13.084 --> 01:23:15.018
We do not have much time.

01:23:15.042 --> 01:23:16.451
He will collapse.

01:23:17.667 --> 01:23:19.159
No, he will hold on.

01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:21.977
Come on, unroll the cord.

01:23:22.001 --> 01:23:24.326
I have to make some connections.

01:23:36.917 --> 01:23:40.742
Are you coming to see how you win a
war like a knight, Jack?

01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:42.742
Like a gentleman, you say?

01:23:51.542 --> 01:23:52.742
Then?

01:23:53.001 --> 01:23:54.785
Make sure the
explosive has started

01:23:54.809 --> 01:23:56.852
correctly.
He must fart at 6:30 a.m.

01:23:56.876 --> 01:23:58.076
Understood?

01:23:58.959 --> 01:24:01.617
It must explode, whatever happens.

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:08.977
Advance.

01:24:09.001 --> 01:24:11.826
Bill, we'll see you there.

01:24:40.334 --> 01:24:41.435
What are you doing?

01:24:41.459 --> 01:24:43.326
A German saw me
I had to kill him.

01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:45.409
I'll go to hell.

01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:50.143
The world is about
to fall on us.

01:24:50.167 --> 01:24:52.617
You must go out. Now.

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:54.393
And you?

01:24:54.417 --> 01:24:57.117
- I have to finish the connections.
- No, Bill.

01:24:57.667 --> 01:24:58.867
Bill ...

01:24:59.376 --> 01:25:01.867
Take that.
He is a Peter soldier.

01:25:02.334 --> 01:25:04.742
Now listen to me carefully.

01:25:05.292 --> 01:25:07.242
You will not go to hell.

01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:10.742
You protected us.

01:25:12.334 --> 01:25:15.326
I should have
protected, sorry.

01:25:15.876 --> 01:25:17.409
But here we are.

01:25:17.792 --> 01:25:21.643
If the war drags on,
before you know it

01:25:21.667 --> 01:25:24.117
Peter will be Charlie's age.

01:25:25.751 --> 01:25:27.367
And I refuse that.

01:25:31.959 --> 01:25:34.492
Everything has to make sense.

01:25:37.667 --> 01:25:41.909
Let some light shine out of
those damn tunnels, okay?

01:26:36.167 --> 01:26:37.367
Come on, Bill ...

01:27:01.459 --> 01:27:02.659
Soldiers ...

01:27:03.292 --> 01:27:05.867
Bayonet barrel.

01:27:19.251 --> 01:27:21.159
Damn...

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:28.534
He will have made it.

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:36.117
Not!

01:28:12.959 --> 01:28:14.326
Go.

01:28:14.501 --> 01:28:15.701
It's good.

01:28:22.126 --> 01:28:23.992
What if Bill is still there?

01:28:25.084 --> 01:28:26.951
He gave us an order.

01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:34.034
The lord is your
shadow at your right hand.

01:29:08.959 --> 01:29:10.409
George?

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:19.367
I thought you ran away.

01:29:26.126 --> 01:29:27.492
And Bill?

01:29:30.001 --> 01:29:31.367
He stayed.

01:30:00.917 --> 01:30:03.076
We take you to see the doctor.

01:30:18.042 --> 01:30:19.242
Well...

01:30:19.834 --> 01:30:21.326
Let's go guys.

01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:23.034
Go.

01:30:35.001 --> 01:30:39.268
<i>This morning, at 6.30 a.m., a
explosion of unprecedented intensity</i>

01:30:39.292 --> 01:30:41.310
<i>pierced the lines
Germans in Messines,</i>

01:30:41.334 --> 01:30:44.768
<i>allowing allied troops
They will take the enemy trenches.</i>

01:30:44.792 --> 01:30:47.602
<i>The explosion, so powerful
that was felt in Downing Street,</i>

01:30:47.626 --> 01:30:49.102
<i>was detonated</i>

01:30:49.126 --> 01:30:51.784
<i>from a camera
excavated underground ...</i>

01:30:57.042 --> 01:30:59.617
I received the telegram,
shouldn't have come.

01:31:02.792 --> 01:31:04.409
Can I go in despite everything?

01:31:19.084 --> 01:31:22.367
We have formulas ready for
use in such situations.

01:31:23.542 --> 01:31:25.367
Words like "hero".

01:31:26.459 --> 01:31:28.326
"Sacrifice".

01:31:30.459 --> 01:31:31.992
"Patriot".

01:31:33.834 --> 01:31:37.534
- But I won't bother you with that.
-I know who he was.

01:31:37.751 --> 01:31:40.227
I didn't need one
war to see it.

01:31:40.251 --> 01:31:42.643
A medal is no more
what a beautiful ornament.

01:31:42.667 --> 01:31:45.492
And a letter from the king ...
Cover your ears.

01:31:47.084 --> 01:31:50.117
No better than
shit written on it.

01:31:56.209 --> 01:31:58.018
I don't think I have met anyone

01:31:58.042 --> 01:32:02.867
as stubborn as his
husband, Mrs. Hawkin.

01:32:04.876 --> 01:32:07.992
But I didn't respect either
nobody but him.

01:32:14.292 --> 01:32:15.951
She was about to forget it.

01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:22.534
This little boy followed
your father everywhere.

01:32:23.084 --> 01:32:24.102
Thanks to him,

01:32:24.126 --> 01:32:27.576
he thought he could achieve
big things. And he did.

01:32:27.751 --> 01:32:29.326
He did it.

01:32:29.667 --> 01:32:32.367
He saved thousands of lives.

01:32:32.959 --> 01:32:35.159
Because he was yours.

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:38.034
And now,

01:32:38.667 --> 01:32:41.117
he returns to the owner of it.

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:54.076
Say hello.

01:33:35.804 --> 01:33:38.460
The Messines explosion was the
most powerful ever recorded.

01:33:38.484 --> 01:33:42.091
The British Prime Minister noted the
detonation from London, 225 km. thence.

01:33:42.115 --> 01:33:44.606
The mines killed more
10,000 German soldiers.

01:33:44.630 --> 01:33:47.172
The enemy camp was taken
by allies in less than 35

01:33:47.196 --> 01:33:49.804
minutes. This was the last
great tunnel of the Great War.
