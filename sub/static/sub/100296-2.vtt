WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:02.553
Previously onDeputy...

00:02.610 --> 00:04.123
County Charter
states that in the event

00:04.170 --> 00:06.638
that a duly-elected sheriff
dies in office,

00:06.700 --> 00:09.692
then the longest serving member
of his mounted posse

00:09.740 --> 00:11.298
shall serve as acting sheriff.

00:11.350 --> 00:12.999
CLARKE:
You're the new sheriff
of Los Angeles County.

00:13.050 --> 00:14.301
I'm no politician.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.316
You don't hand the job
over to a judge.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.395
Send a lawman.

00:17.450 --> 00:18.348
I'm your driver.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.662
I drive myself, thanks.

00:19.710 --> 00:21.758
I'm also your
personal security detail.

00:21.800 --> 00:22.960
As his son...

00:23.450 --> 00:25.589
you're the only one
authorized to wear this.

00:26.800 --> 00:27.937
[groans]

00:29.370 --> 00:31.543
You and Teresa should consider
fostering those kids.

00:31.590 --> 00:33.023
Hyah!
[whistles]

00:33.940 --> 00:35.589
[gunshots]

00:37.600 --> 00:39.682
Enjoy those stars
while you got 'em.

00:39.730 --> 00:41.550
Buckle up.
I'm just gettin' started.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.207
LONDON:
I'll cut to the chase, Sheriff.

00:45.260 --> 00:46.864
Every one of us
is still dealing

00:46.910 --> 00:49.083
with the sudden passing
of Sheriff Bradford.

00:50.390 --> 00:51.869
I, for one, don't think

00:51.920 --> 00:53.956
our city's founders
foresaw the present situation

00:54.010 --> 00:55.261
when they wrote this charter.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.354
So, we wanna take a moment,

00:58.400 --> 01:01.392
figure out what's best
for the department, long term.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.180
And we've come up
with something

01:03.230 --> 01:04.538
we'd like you to consider.

01:04.580 --> 01:06.753
Sheriff Hollister,
this is not a resignation.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.051
The language of this addendum

01:08.110 --> 01:10.362
clearly reflects
a mutual reinstatement

01:10.410 --> 01:12.059
to your former position
as deputy.

01:13.590 --> 01:14.807
With a promotion, of course.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.806
Well...

01:19.600 --> 01:21.249
No one would fault you
for stepping down.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.761
The department
is a massive bureaucracy.

01:23.820 --> 01:25.208
It's not gonna change
overnight,

01:25.250 --> 01:26.467
and let's be honest, Bill,

01:26.520 --> 01:28.203
neither are you.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.125
You know somethin'?
You're right, Jerry.

01:30.870 --> 01:33.475
I've got a few ideas of
what's best for the department.

01:34.350 --> 01:36.124
Which is why
I'm not stepping down.

01:36.790 --> 01:37.825
Far from it.

01:39.620 --> 01:42.999
I've seen a lot of life
from on top of a horse,

01:43.490 --> 01:44.923
and that's given me a

01:44.970 --> 01:46.403
different perspective
on things.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.699
And a new perspective is
exactly what this place needs.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.663
The people of Los Angeles
deserve the best.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.403
So do me a favor.

01:55.460 --> 01:58.497
Worry more about them
and less about me.

02:00.460 --> 02:01.506
I'll be seein' you.

02:02.730 --> 02:03.799
Except you.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.168
If I see your face
on the tenth floor again,

02:08.990 --> 02:10.901
I'll throw you out
the window myself.

02:13.390 --> 02:14.470
Thanks for your time.

02:20.830 --> 02:22.081
Can I help pick the window?

02:23.400 --> 02:25.129
Didn't know you had
that gear in you, Bishop.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.522
I'm Irish and Italian, sir.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.389
You tell me
who to take out, I'll do it.

02:30.670 --> 02:31.967
What part of Italy?

02:32.020 --> 02:33.009
Sicily.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.025
All right, Scott,
you're the eye.

02:41.070 --> 02:42.890
So you need me
right here, right?

02:42.940 --> 02:44.066
-CADE: Right here.
-SCO'|'|': Copy that.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.849
And I want Minnick
backing it up.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.208
Look who it is.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.150
-It's the sheriff.
-OFFICERS: Hey, Sheriff.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.199
Hey, guys.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.638
What, the Jonathon Club
close early?

02:51.690 --> 02:52.725
Enough.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.908
What's the status here?

02:54.950 --> 02:57.077
CADE: _
Guy's name IS
Marshall Huggins.

02:57.130 --> 02:59.166
Dude's connected to
a commercral burglary crew.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.778
I think he's been
casrng a target.

03:01.260 --> 03:02.864
Just got a tip that
they're moving tonight.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.396
And this party's gonna go late,

03:04.440 --> 03:06.214
and I know
you hate parties, Bill.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.090
Not these kinds, I don't.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.528
Just tell_ me
where It's gomg down.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.706
Hey, Bill.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.096
We got this. Go home.

03:13.140 --> 03:14.220
You're the sheriff now.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.314
You call me when you have
these clowns in custody.

03:19.370 --> 03:20.758
You know I will.

03:23.150 --> 03:24.492
All right, Minnick.

03:24.550 --> 03:26.063
You are running flank tonight.

03:26.110 --> 03:28.021
Tuck in two blocks out.

03:28.070 --> 03:30.061
Wait for my signal
and then you're gonna pounce

03:30.120 --> 03:31.371
like the badass
that you are.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.500
All right.
I got you.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.766
You know, this right here--

03:35.250 --> 03:37.718
is what the damn Ivory Tower
needs more than anything.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.685
Less suits and more tats.

03:41.740 --> 03:42.900
[laughter]

03:48.790 --> 03:50.746
PAULA:
Honey, you need
to get some sleep.

03:51.490 --> 03:55.130
It's like I'm in a cage,
walled in.

03:55.190 --> 03:56.612
Like I'm workin'
the jail again.

03:57.580 --> 03:59.093
It's called an office.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.229
Many have survived them.

04:02.630 --> 04:04.882
I spent four hours
yesterday arguing

04:04.940 --> 04:06.976
about pension plans
and budgets

04:07.020 --> 04:09.454
and why our vendor
dropped off

04:09.510 --> 04:12.729
three tons of bad potatoes
at the central jail.

04:12.770 --> 04:14.761
I saved a 10-year-old boy's
leg tonight.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.599
It was worth the six hours
of papenNork.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.553
BILL:
I'd sell my soul

04:22.610 --> 04:25.511
for the Zen satisfaction
of cuffing a bad guy right now.

04:28.130 --> 04:30.121
I'm feeling a little
bad tonight...

04:31.220 --> 04:32.266
Sheriff.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.619
Get the cuffs.

04:50.330 --> 04:51.843
Um, it's just I have--

04:51.900 --> 04:53.970
Mm-hmm. Find a way
that works for you.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.934
I know you'll find
the right balance.

04:57.990 --> 04:58.979
BILL: I'm sorry.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.571

Sorry.

05:36.110 --> 05:37.714
Paula got me
a French press.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.369
Still don't know
how to use the damn thing,

05:40.420 --> 05:41.500
but try it.

05:42.030 --> 05:44.078

05:44.120 --> 05:46.907
Why are you so good to me?

wasn't an InVIte.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.177
What are you doin'?

06:02.230 --> 06:04.004
I'm dying

06:04.050 --> 06:05.745
Just needed a taste.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.869
Paula's gonna kill me.

06:07.540 --> 06:08.837
Quit holding words back.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.050
Something's up.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.106
That crew became active
three months ago

06:14.150 --> 06:16.106
and Burgin paroled outta
Chino three months ago.

06:16.150 --> 06:18.414
What? _
Roman Burgin?

06:18.460 --> 06:19.893
How the hell did he get out?

06:20.550 --> 06:22.245
That's above

11:18.370 --> 11:20.019
Your third strike.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.234
I promise you, you're goin'
right back where you came from.

11:23.290 --> 11:24.416
For life.

11:31.030 --> 11:33.032
[theme music playing]

11:38.520 --> 11:39.999
Is this gonna be a habit, sir?

11:40.040 --> 11:40.995
I'm supposed to pick you up
at your home.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.382
This is my home.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.347
Already made the news
and it's not even nine o'clock.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.879
Speaking of your nine o'clock,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.740
you are supposed to be
in a budget meeting right now.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.618
Tell 'em I'm running late.
I had to make a stop.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.833
You know I'm not an Uber, right?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.222
I know.

11:55.270 --> 11:57.409
Your rider rating
would be one star. Maybe.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.838
That's only because
I'm generous.

11:58.890 --> 12:00.107
Simmer down.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.186
I am your
sword and shield, sir.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.276
But I can only protect you
if you let me.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.585
[sighs] Look.

12:07.590 --> 12:08.670
I need some coffee.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.547
And you definitely do, too.

12:10.590 --> 12:12.114
I got you coffee
and a breakfast burrito.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.469
They're in the car.
Not the point.

12:14.990 --> 12:16.469
And if I may
speak freely, sir...

12:17.300 --> 12:18.289
Like you haven't.

12:18.340 --> 12:20.251
You are not a soldier anymore.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.642
You are a general.

12:22.170 --> 12:23.558
Let the deputies do their job,

12:23.610 --> 12:25.953
so you can do yours as sheriff.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.909
You done?

12:28.790 --> 12:29.779
For now.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.784
I knew you were a Libra.
It all makes sense.

12:32.830 --> 12:34.616
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

12:36.100 --> 12:38.056
Libras can't let go.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.408
They crave control.

12:39.450 --> 12:40.405
A sense of security,

12:40.450 --> 12:42.361
and comfort of permanence.

12:45.110 --> 12:46.759
About my schedule,

12:46.800 --> 12:48.358
it's gonna be changing up a bit.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.502
TERESA:
Hope you guys are hungry.

12:56.550 --> 12:57.812
[cell phone chiming]

12:57.860 --> 12:59.077
CADE [over phone]:
Hey, good morning, baby.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.109
How'd they sleep last night?

13:00.170 --> 13:01.239
Good.

13:01.300 --> 13:02.779
Camilla asked
about her father.

13:02.820 --> 13:03.946
CADE:
What did you say?

13:04.820 --> 13:06.128
TERESA:
I didn't know what to say.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.822
It's just, it's-it's gonna
take some time.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.303
This is new for all of us.

13:10.350 --> 13:12.250
[sighs] You know, let me,
uh, figure something out

13:12.310 --> 13:14.653
and I'll, uh, I'll have
a conversation with her, okay?

13:14.700 --> 13:17.658
It doesn't look like
Camilla's feeling great.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.089
-You wanna try talking to her?
-Yeah.

13:20.140 --> 13:21.129
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

13:21.190 --> 13:22.669
Sick day for you guys.

13:24.410 --> 13:25.536
How does that sound?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.369
TERESA:
Hey, how's, uh, Rachel?

13:29.410 --> 13:30.809
She's, uh, sleeping in.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.272
She, uh, took that desk job.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.490
Good for her.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.639
[Cade laughs]

13:35.680 --> 13:37.284
I bet you'd want me
to do the same thing, right?

13:37.330 --> 13:38.809
Not in a million years.

13:40.990 --> 13:42.332
You almost sold me.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.851
BISHOP: Sir, why do we
have to be at Major's?

13:46.910 --> 13:48.946
I prefer a face-to-face aanay.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.479
It's more than that,
though, isn't it?

13:50.520 --> 13:51.737
I haven't known you long,

13:51.780 --> 13:52.997
but I know your mind's
up to something.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.473
Roman Burgin.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.784
Pulled a few bank jobs
over in Sylmar.

13:57.530 --> 13:59.521
All he had to do was
walk out the front door.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.351
But it wasn't enough.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.700
Shot a 15-year-old girl
and changed her life forever.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.189
Same age as Maggie.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.180
Family friend?

14:09.890 --> 14:11.016
She is now.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.189
Stopped her from bleeding out.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.493
So I made her a promise.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.450
Told her I'd never let him
hurt anyone again.

14:19.030 --> 14:20.588
I plan on keeping that promise.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.548
This guy's got no regard
for human life.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.606
Are you okay?

14:34.560 --> 14:35.606
Everything's good.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.002
BILL:
Roman's on his last strike.

14:41.050 --> 14:42.870
He knows_I'm comin'
after hIm now.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.394
So he's got nothin'
left to lose

14:45.440 --> 14:46.964
but the bullets in his gun.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.058
CADE:
You missed me that much?

14:51.580 --> 14:53.059
You just couldn't
stay away, huh?

14:53.100 --> 14:54.533
I wanna talk to our guy.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.719
Find out how he
linked up with Roman.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.580
Well, my guess is when
they did a tour in Chino.

14:58.630 --> 15:00.018
He's down in lockup.

15:00.070 --> 15:01.287
I don't wanna talk to him here.

15:01.940 --> 15:02.838
What's he talking about?

15:03.810 --> 15:05.027
I tried to talk him out of it.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.799
I want you all to pack it up.

15:07.290 --> 15:08.507
It's moving day.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.729
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Boss, what does that mean?

15:11.780 --> 15:12.906
You'll find out.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.305
Can you adjourn a meeting
if it never started?

15:28.100 --> 15:29.488
We'll reschedule this one.

15:34.670 --> 15:35.796
Where should we set up?

15:35.840 --> 15:36.966
You can use my office.

15:37.020 --> 15:37.918
Copy that.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.368
He didn't.
Oh, yes, he did!

15:40.020 --> 15:41.453
I'm diggin' the place.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.679
What exactly are you
trying to prove, Hollister?

15:44.330 --> 15:46.412
I'm opening up the lines
of communication.

15:46.460 --> 15:47.802
Moving majors.

15:47.850 --> 15:49.932
I can't be going
back and forth from the HOJ.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.070
Time is money.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.280
Would have been
nice to hear it

15:52.340 --> 15:53.295
during the budget meeting
you missed.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.762
Well, I didn't miss the meeting.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.640
Technically,
he pushed the meeting.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.597
Bill, you can't use
this department

15:58.650 --> 16:00.515
to cut through
your own personal red tape.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.993
Jerry, I've lived under you

16:02.040 --> 16:04.474
and Bradford's red tape
for years.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.341
You both had your chance.
Well, now, I got mine.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.868
And I'm gonna use it
to cut through
all the nonsense.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.172
I need all the boots
on the ground I can get.

16:12.230 --> 16:14.004
I'm not_ lettin'
Roman Burgin get away.

16:14.580 --> 16:15.660
Who's Roman?

16:16.970 --> 16:17.959
You've been on the 10th floor
too long, Jerry.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.317
So I apologize

16:19.360 --> 16:20.440
that I missed a few meetings

16:20.500 --> 16:21.797
that weren't life and death.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.101
LONDON:
I understand.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.458
You have your team here now,

16:24.500 --> 16:27.151
so catching the bad guys
should be no problem.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.029
Sir, if you are not
in the room
where It happens,

16:31.070 --> 16:32.856
things will happen without you.

16:33.860 --> 16:34.986
Hamilton,right?

16:36.900 --> 16:38.037
I gotta see that.

16:39.690 --> 16:42.158
BISHOP: In the end,
he's shot by Aaron Burr, sir.

16:42.690 --> 16:44.510
BILL:
Well, let's make sure
that don't happen.

16:47.870 --> 16:49.861
Doctor.
Can you help me, please?

16:49.920 --> 16:50.909
Did you check in with triage?

16:52.090 --> 16:53.170
No insurance.

16:53.790 --> 16:55.394
[sighs] All right,
let me take a look.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.839
-Okay. Julie.
-Yeah?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.791
-PAULA: Okay, sit on the bed.
-Yeah, come on in.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.309
PAULA:
Just clean him up.

17:05.370 --> 17:06.450
[groans sharply]

17:07.720 --> 17:09.711
I need a lido with epi.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.886
You got it.

17:12.590 --> 17:13.932
OFFICER:
Come on.

17:13.980 --> 17:14.935
Did he rat?

17:14.990 --> 17:16.241
Not a word.

17:17.070 --> 17:20.028
Yeah. Saw that the press
say it's a manhunt.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.332
And they're gonna go
wide with the mugshots.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.200
Well, breaking news
gets eyeballs.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.034
Found a phone in the car.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.253
It's pretty busted up
but I think it could
give us a lead.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.382
I just need you to
cut through some red tape.

17:31.130 --> 17:33.690
Well, it's about time this
sheriff thing came in handy.

17:33.740 --> 17:35.082
I'll push through a warrant.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.131
Who_o_. Your first
political favor.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.525
Make sure you take
a shower afterwards.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.877
Sir.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.353
We have to leave if_
we're gonna beat traffic.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.446
Right.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.048
This is one meeting
I won't miss.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.920
-God son's first day on patrol.
-CADE: Yep.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.186
In all my years
in the department,

17:50.240 --> 17:53.061
I can count the times
I saw a sheriff

17:53.110 --> 17:55.977
actually walk into a station
on one hand.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.764
But this man over here
is different.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.469
Our paths have crossed
many times as deputies,

18:03.250 --> 18:04.114
now as sheriff.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.337
[applause]

18:11.430 --> 18:12.988
Deputy Luna, thank you.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.119
Sheriff Hollister.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.999
[scoffs] I'm still gettin'
used to the sound of that.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.953
And wearin' those stars.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.259
But I tell you what,
I'm gonna earn 'em...

18:27.140 --> 18:28.448
for each one of you.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.273
Because I am one of you.

18:32.150 --> 18:34.015
I wanna be face-to-face
with the men and women

18:34.060 --> 18:36.016
who actually put
boots on the ground.

18:36.460 --> 18:37.939
You all.

18:37.980 --> 18:39.709
'Cause I've worn
those boots before.

18:40.290 --> 18:42.850
In fact,
I'm still wearing 'em.

18:43.810 --> 18:45.721
[laughter]

18:47.640 --> 18:48.902
Actually, uh...

18:50.730 --> 18:52.038
you're all fired.

18:54.690 --> 18:56.032
You think I'm kidding?
I'm not.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.470
Today, you're gonna spend
the next 10 hours proving...

19:01.180 --> 19:02.693
why we should keep you.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.224
If you make it home,

19:05.840 --> 19:06.829
you're hired.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.874
And tomorrow morning,
you're fired again.

19:11.540 --> 19:13.758
Think about that
every day you're workin'.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.140
I got 104 days left here.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.537
I'm gonna make 'em count.

19:22.330 --> 19:23.365
That's all I got.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.069
-Thank you.
-[applause]

19:25.120 --> 19:26.508
[inaudible]

19:27.900 --> 19:29.982
You heard the sheriff.
Everybody, 10-8.

19:30.030 --> 19:31.338
Harris you're with me.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.689
Trainees, standby.

19:33.730 --> 19:35.641
REPORTER [on TV]:
The city remains on edge

19:35.690 --> 19:38.079
as the Los Angeles
Sheriff's Department
ups their hunt

19:38.130 --> 19:41.031
for serial jewelry robber
Roman Burgin
and his co-conspirator.

19:41.090 --> 19:42.990
A security guard
arrived on scene

19:43.050 --> 19:45.689
moments into the break-in
only to be gunned down.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.567
Call security. Now!

19:51.710 --> 19:52.745
I'm on my way.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.977
[indistinct chatter]

20:04.290 --> 20:05.803
-Hey, guys.
-MAN: Hey, Sheriff.

20:06.590 --> 20:07.545
It was a good speech.

20:08.380 --> 20:09.586
Just making my rounds.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.198
A sheriff's gotta show his face.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.116
Your dad and I were sittin'
right where you were Sittln'.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.899
Our first day was a doozy.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.513
But you got Luna
to teach you.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.608
You just keep your head
on a swivel.

20:21.650 --> 20:23.254
So, that's where my dad
got that term

20:23.300 --> 20:24.608
"head on a swivel."

20:26.790 --> 20:28.269
He gave a lot to me.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.570
Least I could do is share
a few gems In return.

20:33.790 --> 20:34.779
Yes, sir.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.705
Sheriff, you got a call.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.138
Well, take a message.

20:38.190 --> 20:40.966
Can't you see I'm bonding
with my deputies here?

20:41.500 --> 20:43.104
It's Dr. Reyes, sir.

20:43.150 --> 20:45.141
BILL: Hey.
Everything okay?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.451
PAULA [on phone]:
There's a guy here
at the hospital.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.058
He was acting kind of odd.

20:48.110 --> 20:49.623
I think he might have something
to do with the robbery.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.806
I'll be right there.

20:52.590 --> 20:53.761
Make a hole.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.247
LUNA:
Feeling left out?

20:57.290 --> 20:58.769
You know I fly better solo.

21:03.130 --> 21:05.997
Been assigned to majors
to help out for a few days.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.996
With Rachel gone,
they're a little short-handed,

21:08.040 --> 21:10.122
so I'm wrapping up
some of her cases.

21:13.620 --> 21:14.655
I got you something.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.657
St. Michael.

21:19.450 --> 21:20.485
LUNA: The protector.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.832
I'll feel safer
if you at least have him.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.270
Since you don't have anyone
riding with you this year.

21:32.550 --> 21:35.280
-You know this is
cheesy as hell.
-You love it.

21:36.900 --> 21:37.980
Hey, I couldn't find the...

21:38.990 --> 21:40.469
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:40.510 --> 21:41.499
Sorry.

21:46.260 --> 21:47.989
-[Minnick chuckles]
-Shh.

DISPATCH [on radio]:
We have a Code 9 on
the corner of Figueroa...

21:54.260 --> 21:57.081
Sir, I'm... I'm sorry.

21:57.880 --> 21:58.869
For what?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.228
For what I saw back there.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.000
What did you see?

22:06.580 --> 22:07.660
Nothin'.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.840
Nothin'?

22:10.410 --> 22:11.627
Really?

22:11.670 --> 22:13.399
-Nothin'?
-Yeah.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.842
So what are you sorry about?

22:16.420 --> 22:17.637
Sir, I don't know
what you want me to say.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.329
I want you to say what you saw.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.191
You're no good to me
or the department

22:21.250 --> 22:22.205
if you can't do that.

22:26.690 --> 22:30.035
I saw you and Deputy Minnick...

22:31.610 --> 22:32.907
kissing.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.086
That's it?

22:34.960 --> 22:35.949
JOSEPH: Yeah.

22:37.050 --> 22:38.210
Look, I'm-I'm sorry.

22:38.260 --> 22:39.568
You don't need to apologize.

22:39.610 --> 22:40.781
You need to pay attention.

22:41.310 --> 22:43.392
In this job,
you will walk into situations

22:43.440 --> 22:45.396
where you have
a matter of seconds

22:45.450 --> 22:47.259
to figure out
what the story is.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.924
Every detail is crucial.

22:48.970 --> 22:51.438
A sideways glance,
a furtive gesture.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.401
Two adults sharing
a moment of intimacy

22:54.460 --> 22:55.586
before they head out on watch.

22:56.070 --> 22:56.934
[snickers]

22:58.630 --> 23:00.939
-I'm serious.
-JOSEPH: I know, sir.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.288
I hope so.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.377
Could mean your life.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.240
Or mine.

23:10.470 --> 23:11.721
-[knock on door]
-Come in.

23:13.340 --> 23:14.557
What's he done now?

23:14.610 --> 23:16.214
Not Sheriff Hollister,

23:16.260 --> 23:18.512
but this person
doesn't have an appointment.

23:18.570 --> 23:20.435
-Ma'am.
-Jerry London.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.651
LONDON: Yes.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.475
You've been served.

23:24.310 --> 23:25.356

Sorry.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.582
-BILL: Hey.
-Hey.

23:44.640 --> 23:45.891
You okay?

23:45.940 --> 23:46.986
Yeah.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.410
Hi, Paula.
Here's your six-pack.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.552
He may or may not be in here.
I want you to look--

23:52.600 --> 23:54.556
PAULA: That's him.
It's definitely him.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.158
Now, how confident are you?

23:57.040 --> 23:58.735
A hundred percent.

23:58.780 --> 24:00.338
-Thanks, doc.
-BILL: All right. Here we go.

24:00.390 --> 24:01.778
Yeah, Cade, you go ahead.

24:01.830 --> 24:03.343
I need to talk to the patient
in here for a sec.

24:03.390 --> 24:04.470
CADE: Copy. I'll have
the truck running, boss.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.430
-What, honey? I gotta...
-Look at me.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.131
My eyes.

24:09.660 --> 24:11.446
I got two robbery suspects
ready to wreak havoc, okay?

24:11.490 --> 24:13.651
-I'm not letting 'em get away.
-You're out of your cage,
I know.

24:13.710 --> 24:16.099
-This isn't the time for this.
-You need to just take a beat.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.629
You're on autopilot right now.

24:17.670 --> 24:18.796
And you know what happens
when you do that, just...

24:19.630 --> 24:21.018
breathe.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.140
Okay?

24:22.800 --> 24:24.324
Don't put this all on you.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.622
It's gonna eat you up alive.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.153
I don't know
any other way to be.

24:33.380 --> 24:35.075
[footsteps receding]

24:37.560 --> 24:38.982

24:40.690 --> 24:42.203
REPORTER [on TV]:
The city remains on edge

24:42.260 --> 24:43.773
as the Los Angeles
Sheriff's Department

24:43.830 --> 24:45.821
ups their hunt
for serial jewelry robber

24:45.870 --> 24:48.122
Roman Burgin
and his coconspirator.

24:48.180 --> 24:49.431
MAN: Oh, hell, no, man.

24:50.180 --> 24:52.216
Let's go get some cash, boss.
Get out of here.

24:52.270 --> 24:54.704
...they are armed
and highly dangerous.

24:56.930 --> 24:57.965
Jesus, Roman.

24:58.010 --> 24:59.227
What the hell did you do?

24:59.280 --> 25:00.793
Just need a ride to Palmdale

25:00.840 --> 25:02.364
while this blows over,
okay, baby?

25:02.410 --> 25:04.719
No. Don't get me involved
in any more of your things.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.271
Who said I'm asking?

25:08.590 --> 25:09.750
I'm not going down for you.

25:10.370 --> 25:11.507
Grab your stuff.

25:14.290 --> 25:16.155
Now they got a warrant
and a name.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.724
That burner was purchased
by Diane Cortana.

25:18.770 --> 25:20.328
Let's pay her a visit

25:20.380 --> 25:21.551
and see if she's home.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.256
[indistinct chatter]

25:32.050 --> 25:33.529
Pop quiz.

25:33.570 --> 25:35.697
Which one of these places
is slinging?

25:36.700 --> 25:38.099
My guess is the vape shop.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.059
That's where you go for
stolen credit card numbers.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.180
Try again.

25:42.710 --> 25:44.359
Then, it's gotta be
the liquor store.

25:44.410 --> 25:45.536
Wrong.

25:45.580 --> 25:46.706
You wanna phone a friend?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.051
The El Salvadorian spot?

25:49.720 --> 25:51.108
Now, that's just racist.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.229
So, the laundromat
is a drug front?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.279
Ding, ding, ding.
Now tell me why.

25:59.770 --> 26:00.941
A lot of homeless in and out.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.810
It's cash business.

26:05.430 --> 26:06.510
Makes sense.

26:09.910 --> 26:12.083
What's up, Levon?
You still alive?

26:12.650 --> 26:13.776
[mouths] Boom, boom.

26:17.530 --> 26:19.748
You're not ready for
that lesson, Deputy Harris.

26:20.660 --> 26:21.740
Not yet.

26:25.930 --> 26:27.921
OFFICER:
Sheriff's Department!

26:29.840 --> 26:31.102
It's my room.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.580
Clear.

26:35.330 --> 26:36.888
All right, get up
on her phone ASAP

26:36.940 --> 26:38.760
and figure out what tower
she's pinging off of, all right?

26:38.810 --> 26:40.414
They were here.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.280
We locate her,
we locate these punks.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.169
[elevator door dings]

26:48.170 --> 26:49.649
What are we doin' here?

26:49.690 --> 26:51.169
Now it's touchin' my family.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.814
BISHOP:
Sheriff, I need you
to trust me on this.

26:52.870 --> 26:54.428
You cannot keep chasing down

26:54.480 --> 26:56.380
every call
in Los Angeles County.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.609
How many more Romans
are out there in the world?

26:58.660 --> 27:00.434
Are you gonna chase every one
of them throughout the city?

27:00.480 --> 27:02.436
IfI feel like it, yeah.

27:02.490 --> 27:04.299
You may not see it now, Sheriff,

27:04.360 --> 27:06.442
but you can save lives
up here, too.

27:06.490 --> 27:08.617
If you put just a little faith
in the system.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.017
Really?

27:15.060 --> 27:16.459
The more you stick
to the talking points,

27:16.500 --> 27:17.808
the sooner you're out of there.

27:17.850 --> 27:19.101
And I promise you,

27:19.150 --> 27:20.367
if we get any word
on Roman,

27:20.420 --> 27:21.978
I will pull you out immediately.

27:22.030 --> 27:23.156
You do that.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.991
Why are we here?

27:38.350 --> 27:40.386
That jewelry's been tagged.
We need cash.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.692
Cartel money drop.
Runs like clockwork.

27:42.740 --> 27:44.219
It's easy money, baby.

27:44.270 --> 27:45.783
You told me once you got out,
things would change.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.138
Hey, hey, hey.

27:47.180 --> 27:48.738
Someone gotta pay
the bills, right?

27:50.010 --> 27:51.966
-Hey, keep an eye on her, okay?
-Yeah, man.

27:52.010 --> 27:52.999
Hey.

27:53.750 --> 27:55.092
Don't think about leaving.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.058
It'd be worse for you
and your family, okay?

28:06.550 --> 28:08.586
Majors, Diane's phone came up.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.858
She's hidden within
a 60-meter radius

28:10.900 --> 28:12.948
of the 1300 block
on Whittier.

28:14.430 --> 28:17.206
Minnick, start moving in
from the east.

28:18.910 --> 28:20.252
Hey, where's the cash, homeboy?

28:20.300 --> 28:21.733
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

28:22.650 --> 28:24.254

-I don't know, bro.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.268
Hey, come here.
Where's the cash?

28:32.230 --> 28:33.310

Get back in your vehicles.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.062
[Bill clears throat]

31:04.640 --> 31:06.767
I think everyone
up in this Ivory Tower

31:06.820 --> 31:09.038
needs to spend more time
on the streets.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.297
On patrol.

31:10.950 --> 31:12.679
In a patrol car?

31:12.740 --> 31:13.900
Well, yeah.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.349
Or on a horse,
in the mounted division.

31:17.390 --> 31:18.732
Now, that's a great idea.

31:19.090 --> 31:20.398
Bill, you can't be serious.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.396
I'm serious as a heart attack.

31:23.050 --> 31:25.484
You've all lost touch
with what it's like out there.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.184
It's time to get in touch
with your inner deputy.

31:28.230 --> 31:29.743
[door opens]

31:34.980 --> 31:36.311
I gotta put a pin in this.

31:40.110 --> 31:41.589
[softly]:
Roman's headed north on the I-5,

31:41.630 --> 31:43.586
vehicles were in pursuit,
but they lost him.

31:46.510 --> 31:48.068
How do I shut down a freeway?

31:48.120 --> 31:49.894
That would require
a logistics meeting.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.724
How about_in the next
five minutes?

31:51.770 --> 31:53.294
Impossible.

31:53.340 --> 31:54.591
Of course it is, Jerry.

31:55.260 --> 31:57.421
LONDON: Bill, you can't
shut down the freeways.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.645
I'm not a big
"can't" guy, Jerry.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.043
And it's not freeways,
it's one, the 5.

32:02.090 --> 32:03.569
Oh, just the 5.

32:03.610 --> 32:05.737
Actually it's two,
the 101 as well.

32:05.790 --> 32:08.304
The longer we talk,
the further away Roman gets.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.429
Okay, where's he headed?

32:09.490 --> 32:10.912
That's the point.
I don't know.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.221
We need to jam him up,

32:12.270 --> 32:13.965
seal the_ entrance
and exrt ramps,

32:14.010 --> 32:16.058
-so we can corral him.
-And if he gets past them?

32:16.100 --> 32:18.489
Then he'll be the only person
moving in this town.

You're out
of your mind, Hollister!
