00:03.900 --> 00:05.510
Ariel, what's going on in there?

00:05.560 --> 00:06.870
Did you fall in or something?

00:09.170 --> 00:09.990
Seriously!

00:10.040 --> 00:11.660
You're going to make
us late for school!

00:12.530 --> 00:13.950
ARIEL : I told you, go away.

00:14.580 --> 00:15.800
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

00:16.290 --> 00:18.280
25. Why aren't you guys dressed?

00:18.530 --> 00:19.300
We would be...

00:19.330 --> 00:21.860
If Ariel would get
out of the bathroom!

00:22.220 --> 00:25.220
She's been in there for, like,
20 minutes. Okay, okay.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.910
Ariel, you all right in there?

00:27.570 --> 00:29.280
Just go away, Dad.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.630
Just go... go use me
and Mom's bathroom.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.409
But my toothbrush
is in this bathroom.

00:33.410 --> 00:34.449
All right, just your finger.

00:34.450 --> 00:35.330
Go on, go on.

00:35.930 --> 00:36.740
Ariel.

00:37.550 --> 00:39.810
Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out, okay?

00:39.940 --> 00:42.490
No! You can't figure this out.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.760
You want me to go get Mom?

00:44.930 --> 00:45.760
No!

00:45.880 --> 00:47.690
Mom can't help me. No one can.

00:47.730 --> 00:49.110
Ariel, come on, now!

00:50.230 --> 00:51.830
All right, open the door.
I'm serious.

00:51.870 --> 00:52.940
You want me to go get the key?

01:00.710 --> 01:01.570
Ariel?

01:04.080 --> 01:05.150
Help me, Daddy.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.940
What's wrong with me, Daddy?

01:10.350 --> 01:12.190
What's happening to me?

01:19.760 --> 01:20.930
Oh, no.

01:22.810 --> 01:25.230
Ariel, honey,
what are you doing up?

01:26.850 --> 01:28.740
58 in the morning.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.590
You promised me you weren't
going to study past 12:00.

01:32.660 --> 01:35.410
Uh, I... I wasn't planning to.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.629
I just took a practice quiz

01:37.630 --> 01:39.660
and realized I had a lot
more studying to do.

01:40.810 --> 01:41.880
What are you doing up?

01:43.280 --> 01:44.420
Weird dream.

01:44.910 --> 01:46.910
Thought I'd get a glass of milk.
Do you want one?

01:47.020 --> 01:49.360
Mom, I'm trying to stay awake.

01:50.530 --> 01:52.290
Honey, come on.

01:52.340 --> 01:54.580
You know I don't like you
pulling these all-nighters.

01:54.630 --> 01:55.920
You're not going to
learn anything new

01:55.921 --> 01:58.080
58 in the morning. I know.

01:58.450 --> 01:59.580
I know. I just...

01:59.750 --> 02:01.420
I need, like, ten more minutes.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.480
And that glass of milk
sounds really nice, actually.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.280 --> 02:18.560
While I'm young, Mom.

02:21.070 --> 02:21.940
Right.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.200
While you're still young.

03:01.700 --> 03:05.330
Medium 620

03:11.950 --> 03:14.220
Hey, you can't have
soda for breakfast.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.500
Hey, I'm pretty sure I can.

03:17.140 --> 03:18.750
Soda, Ariel, really?

03:19.460 --> 03:20.700
I think it's a little
early in the morning

03:20.750 --> 03:23.309
for caffeine and sugar,
don't you? Told ya.

03:23.310 --> 03:24.589
But I need sugar and caffeine

03:24.590 --> 03:26.260
because I need something
to keep me awake

03:26.261 --> 03:28.160
for my AP Chem. Exam.

03:28.290 --> 03:29.300
More like you need something

03:29.301 --> 03:31.590
to keep you awake for
your new boyfriend.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.780
Did I just hear the "B" Word?

03:33.900 --> 03:35.180
Yeah, he's got a name.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.060
Liam McManus.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.490
Never heard of him.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.400
Should I have heard of him? Nope.

03:40.630 --> 03:41.840
Nothing to hear about.

03:41.841 --> 03:44.449
He's just a friend,
and he took AP Chem. Last year.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.529
So, he lent me his old notes.

03:46.530 --> 03:48.349
What kind of person
keeps their old notes

03:48.350 --> 03:50.289
from a high school class?
What are you talking about?

03:50.290 --> 03:51.880
A got a whole box full
of notes from college.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.189
In the garage.

03:53.190 --> 03:54.520
There's nothing wrong
with that. What?

03:54.880 --> 03:56.749
That sounds smart to me. Okay.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.049
Well, Liam is smart.

03:58.050 --> 04:00.229
Uh, and if he keeps a 4.
0 this year,

04:00.230 --> 04:03.439
he gets a full
scholarship to Stanford.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.500
Hey, can I have
some of that coffee?

04:04.501 --> 04:06.200
'Cause that doesn't have sugar.

04:07.400 --> 04:07.899
You know what?

04:07.900 --> 04:09.209
I don't like the
way your eyes look.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.500
I know I told you that you could
take the car today, but...

04:11.770 --> 04:13.279
I don't think I want
you behind the wheel.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.680
Not on a couple hours sleep.

04:14.681 --> 04:16.440
No, but I-I need the car.

04:16.450 --> 04:18.488
I'm babysitting Brendan
for the Kerrigans tonight.

04:18.490 --> 04:19.720
I need to get there
before you get home.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.270
Don't worry about it.
Come on, we'll work it out.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.660
But I'm going to give
you a ride to school.

04:26.040 --> 04:26.890
: But...

04:29.400 --> 04:30.699
All right, everyone, pencils down

04:30.700 --> 04:32.470
and pass your answer
sheets forward.

04:36.980 --> 04:37.800
Brutal.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.410
Yeah.

04:41.850 --> 04:42.650
Ariel.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.720
That was a-- that was a tough one.

04:50.010 --> 04:51.420
You look a little tired, Ariel.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.040
Are you sure you're going to be
able to babysit Brendan tonight?

04:54.160 --> 04:55.180
Uh, absolutely.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.220
30, right?

04:57.430 --> 04:59.570
Thanks again for coming
on such short notice.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.150
It's always hard for me
to get out of the house

05:01.151 --> 05:02.660
when my husband's out of town.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.200
I'm grateful, really.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.230
Was there something else?

05:26.140 --> 05:26.900
No.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.140
Sorry, I'll...

05:29.480 --> 05:30.760
I'll see you at 6:30.

05:37.750 --> 05:38.860
She's lost it.

05:39.850 --> 05:41.290
I'm sorry, I mean,
I know you like her,

05:41.330 --> 05:42.870
and I know you babysit for her,

05:42.960 --> 05:44.790
but that test was
cruel and unusual.

05:44.910 --> 05:45.880
I'm worried about her.

05:46.270 --> 05:47.730
Worried about her? Worry about me.

05:47.770 --> 05:49.140
I'm the one on the
verge of flunking.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.850
Seems like she's changed
a lot since last year.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.750
I mean, I don't know.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.180
She just seemed happy.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.690
I guess.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.559
She was the yearbook advisor,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.240
and she chaperoned
all the field trips,

06:01.241 --> 06:02.799
and now she just teaches.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.570
And she doesn't seem to
like that very much either.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.660
Well... she did just have a baby.

06:08.180 --> 06:09.529
After my mom had my little sister,

06:09.530 --> 06:11.160
she couldn't go ten
minutes without crying

06:11.161 --> 06:12.640
for, like, three months.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.269
Speaking of beautiful babies...

06:17.270 --> 06:18.770
hottie at 11:00.

06:25.990 --> 06:26.930
Here he comes.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.270
And here I go.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.080
No, no, no, where?

06:30.810 --> 06:31.730
Where are you going?

06:31.740 --> 06:33.919
Ariel, come on,
you're into this guy.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.499
And I've got about
four days of freedom

06:35.500 --> 06:37.479
before my parents find out
how I did on that exam.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.010
I'm not going to waste
them being a third wheel.

06:39.970 --> 06:41.390
I don't-- I don't
like him like that.

06:41.810 --> 06:42.480
Right.

06:42.490 --> 06:44.980
You know, denial is such
an ugly shade on you.

06:47.630 --> 06:48.330
Dubois.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.460
Hey, Liam. Hey.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.630
How'd your big test go?

06:53.560 --> 06:55.850
Well, if I did even
halfway decently,

06:55.910 --> 06:57.000
it's totally thanks to you.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.040
And if I didn't, it's 'cause I
stayed up all night studying.

07:00.850 --> 07:02.660
Hmm. Yeah, well,
you got to pace yourself.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.310
Is that how you get a
full ride to Stanford?

07:07.230 --> 07:08.559
Well, I kind of wish

07:08.560 --> 07:09.890
you would've told me
that a little sooner.

07:09.900 --> 07:12.109
I have a Spanish
presentation sixth period,

07:12.110 --> 07:13.759
and I'm starting to worry

07:13.760 --> 07:15.740
I might doze off right
in the middle of.

07:15.750 --> 07:16.710
Um...

07:17.210 --> 07:20.280
Well, I don't recommend a
steady diet of all-nighters,

07:20.400 --> 07:22.330
although I've pulled
one or two in my day.

07:22.380 --> 07:24.410
But, uh, if you're really wiped,

07:24.920 --> 07:26.230
I think I got just
the thing for you.

07:27.370 --> 07:28.210
Hold out your hand.

07:30.130 --> 07:30.810
Come on.

07:31.310 --> 07:31.990
Okay.

07:34.550 --> 07:35.270
There.

07:39.530 --> 07:40.390
Your keys.

07:40.690 --> 07:42.940
Yeah, th-the big one in
the middle is for my car.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.949
: Wait, I don't get it.

07:45.950 --> 07:47.669
You want me to drive
your car around

07:47.670 --> 07:49.530
so that I stay awake
during Spanish? : No.

07:49.850 --> 07:50.859
It's a station wagon.

07:50.860 --> 07:51.959
If you fold the seats down,

07:51.960 --> 07:53.630
it's actually a pretty
good place to take a nap.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.669
It's been my secret exam weapon

07:55.670 --> 07:57.140
ever since my mom
gave me the keys.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.899
You sleep in your
car during school?

07:59.900 --> 08:01.680
Oh, yeah, sure, as long as I
have a free period that day.

08:02.180 --> 08:03.790
How else do you think
I keep up my GPA?

08:05.430 --> 08:06.009
But I don't know.

08:06.010 --> 08:07.550
What if somebody
finds me out there?

08:07.940 --> 08:08.950
That's never happened to me.

08:10.650 --> 08:12.170
You want me to wake you
up after fifth period?

08:12.370 --> 08:13.260
Um...

08:14.850 --> 08:17.830
Thanks for the offer,
but I don't...

08:35.169 --> 08:36.970
Hola, senorita.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.159
Ready to give that presentation?

08:40.690 --> 08:41.530
What?

08:42.620 --> 08:43.940
Sixth period bell just rang.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.160
Nap time is over.

08:45.670 --> 08:46.240
Um...?

08:46.280 --> 08:50.169
I don't understand.

08:50.170 --> 08:51.540
How did-- how did I get here?

08:52.350 --> 08:53.140
Wow.

08:53.230 --> 08:55.339
You really were wiped, huh?

08:55.340 --> 08:56.279
No, no, you don't understand.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.110
I really don't remember
how I got here.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.290
The last thing I remember was...

09:01.350 --> 09:04.730
You and me were on the quad,
and you-you offered me your keys.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.040
And now I'm here.

09:06.050 --> 09:07.940
I mean, in between, nothing.

09:09.690 --> 09:10.540
You know what I mean?

09:14.530 --> 09:15.780
It happened again.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.290
Hey, Brendan.

09:26.960 --> 09:27.740
Hey.

09:28.110 --> 09:28.830
Hi.

09:28.980 --> 09:30.160
No, it's okay.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.810
Oh, oh, oh, I know.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.550
I know. Shh, shh.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.410
You want your mommy? Yeah?

09:37.860 --> 09:39.050
Yeah, you want your mommy?

09:39.090 --> 09:40.630
I think I want my mommy, too.

09:41.050 --> 09:43.130
Okay, okay, okay.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.980
Let's see if we can get them
on the phone first, okay?

09:46.030 --> 09:47.110
Okay. Come on.

10:13.850 --> 10:14.600
Miss Dubois.

10:16.260 --> 10:17.400
You ready to give
your statement now?

10:19.590 --> 10:20.800
Statement about what?

10:21.820 --> 10:22.590
What...

10:23.770 --> 10:26.490
Uh, wha-what's happening to me?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.650
Where-where did all
the cars come from?

10:31.010 --> 10:32.020
How did I get here?

10:32.200 --> 10:33.610
You called 911.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.890
I was the first officer
on the scene, remember?

10:38.380 --> 10:39.720
No, actually, I don't.

10:40.310 --> 10:41.070
Um...

10:43.380 --> 10:45.360
What time is it right now?

10:46.870 --> 10:49.460
It's about 8:30. Why?

10:49.960 --> 10:51.000
It happened again.

10:51.590 --> 10:53.340
Oh, I'm sorry,
what happened again? Ariel!

10:55.230 --> 10:56.200
It's okay, I'm here.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.070
Your father's on his way.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.160
Everything's gonna be okay.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.210
It's not okay.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.360
Okay, something is wrong with me.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.030
Something is happening to me.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.250
Honey, what are you talking about?

11:05.390 --> 11:06.790
I keep losing time.

11:07.180 --> 11:10.400
In one second, I am one place,
the next, I am someplace else.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.560
They are asking me
to give a statement

11:12.590 --> 11:14.310
about what happened to Mrs.
Kerrigan,

11:14.360 --> 11:16.870
and I don't remember anything.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.360
I don't remember calling 911.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.920
Sweetie, look at me.

11:21.570 --> 11:24.439
It's okay. Whatever it is,
we are going to figure it out.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.510
It's okay, I promise.

11:33.550 --> 11:34.280
Ariel.

11:35.780 --> 11:36.460
You okay?

11:39.270 --> 11:40.130
Sarah Bishop.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.330
Ms. Bishop.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.230
From down the street.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.200
We just moved in a few
doors down from you.

11:50.630 --> 11:52.470
We met last weekend, remember?

11:54.890 --> 11:56.510
I'm sorry, I don't feel well.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.970
I need to call my mom and dad.

12:01.010 --> 12:02.140
I need to get home.

12:03.010 --> 12:04.250
Your mom and dad?

12:08.460 --> 12:09.180
Okay.

12:09.570 --> 12:11.030
I just finished up my last class.

12:11.070 --> 12:12.520
If you're sick,
I can take you home.

12:19.150 --> 12:20.110
Feeling any better?

12:20.840 --> 12:21.700
Uh, no.

12:21.910 --> 12:23.450
Sorry, I just really
want to get home.

12:25.790 --> 12:28.440
Well... good news.

12:30.130 --> 12:31.080
We're here.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.190
I thought you said you
knew where I lived.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.280
I do.

12:46.370 --> 12:48.030
Isn't this your house?

12:49.340 --> 12:50.610
MAN : Hey. You're home early.

12:54.390 --> 12:55.470
Hey there, neighbor.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.340
You and Bob finally get
all your stuff unpacked?

12:57.790 --> 12:59.520
Hola, senorita.

13:00.510 --> 13:01.640
Ready to give that presentation?

13:03.010 --> 13:05.850
Liam, what are you doing here?

13:06.100 --> 13:07.060
I left you a message.

13:07.130 --> 13:07.870
Didn't you get it?

13:08.500 --> 13:11.460
My meeting got pushed,
so... I came home a little early.

13:15.610 --> 13:18.090
Uh... what... what are you
talking about-- "Home"?

13:18.170 --> 13:18.890
This isn't your home.

13:18.910 --> 13:19.900
I've seen your home.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.560
What's going on?

13:23.120 --> 13:25.270
There's nothing going on,
and this is my home.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.470
It's your home, too.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.600
We live here-- you, me, and Anna.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.350
Who's Anna?

13:32.760 --> 13:34.150
Uh, three-foot-eight,

13:34.390 --> 13:36.760
likes birthday cake and drawing
on the wall in permanent marker,

13:37.550 --> 13:39.100
came out of your womb,
like, five years ago?

13:40.270 --> 13:41.350
Any of that ring a bell?

13:41.670 --> 13:42.750
Mommy!

13:43.770 --> 13:44.660
You're home!

13:51.870 --> 13:55.620
Ix years ago, right after
you got your master's.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.480
Bridgette was your maid of honor.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.680
My dad was the best man.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.680
You really don't remember, do you?

14:05.690 --> 14:06.800
No.

14:08.940 --> 14:12.150
When I woke up this morning,
I was a teenager,

14:13.470 --> 14:14.940
okay, and now apparently,

14:15.250 --> 14:17.470
the last ten years of my
life have disappeared.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.880
I'm... married.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.780
I have a child.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.790
Honey...

14:24.750 --> 14:25.940
Please don't call me that.

14:26.810 --> 14:30.070
I'm not your honey,
I'm not your wife.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.790
Okay, I-I can't be.

14:32.950 --> 14:33.980
I'm in high school.

14:35.150 --> 14:38.140
You teach high school, Ariel,

14:38.250 --> 14:39.670
the same as our neighbor Sarah.

14:39.740 --> 14:40.330
Okay, I know,

14:40.370 --> 14:41.660
I know, you told me that,
and I, and I know

14:41.710 --> 14:43.160
that you're just
trying to help me,

14:44.390 --> 14:45.870
but I don't belong here.

14:46.530 --> 14:49.910
Okay, I... I need to go home,
I need to go to my real home.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.900
Okay, I need to
talk to my parents.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.590
Okay.

14:54.220 --> 14:55.750
Okay? Sure.

14:56.020 --> 14:56.800
Why not?

14:57.040 --> 14:59.110
Maybe they can figure out
what this is all about.

15:00.610 --> 15:01.679
They always have a
much better handle

15:01.680 --> 15:02.910
on this kind of stuff than I do.

15:03.220 --> 15:04.190
Wait, you know?

15:05.390 --> 15:07.490
You know about me,
you know about my mom?

15:07.560 --> 15:08.360
Ariel,

15:08.820 --> 15:09.630
we're married.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.589
Okay, so then, then you think
maybe these gaps in my memory,

15:13.590 --> 15:15.499
all this time that I've lost,

15:15.500 --> 15:16.980
you think it might have
something to do with that?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.110
I don't know, but let's
go ask the experts.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.020
Shall we?

15:27.890 --> 15:28.760
Honey, what is it?

15:28.810 --> 15:30.090
You look like you've been crying.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.910
Mom.

15:34.410 --> 15:35.710
Mom.

15:39.930 --> 15:42.259
Oh, slow down.

15:42.260 --> 15:43.260
I don't recognize her.

15:44.070 --> 15:45.660
I don't know who she is.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.200
I mean, Liam keeps telling
me that she's mine,

15:48.250 --> 15:51.040
but... for that matter,
I barely know Liam.

15:51.180 --> 15:52.930
And he's supposed
to be my husband?

15:53.770 --> 15:57.040
Mom, the last ten years
of my life are gone,

15:58.440 --> 15:59.809
okay, and I don't know,
I was just hoping

15:59.810 --> 16:01.590
that maybe you could
help me get them back.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.770
So the last thing you remember

16:03.820 --> 16:05.810
is the night that Mrs.
Kerrigan died?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.650
Um, I was with Mom
outside her house.

16:09.690 --> 16:13.420
There were police everywhere,
and they said that I was,

16:13.800 --> 16:15.460
was inside when Mrs.
Kerrigan was shot,

16:15.510 --> 16:16.820
but I don't remember that.

16:17.270 --> 16:19.320
Okay, I don't remember anything

16:19.500 --> 16:21.060
except for finding the body.

16:21.590 --> 16:23.610
I mean, I still don't
know what happened to her.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.840
Well, no one does, not really.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.500
All the police could
figure out for certain

16:28.560 --> 16:30.080
was that it was an execution.

16:30.210 --> 16:31.670
The killer didn't steal anything,

16:31.750 --> 16:33.770
didn't assault her in any way.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.550
Just went in and
shot her and left.

16:37.640 --> 16:40.330
The police questioned her husband,
her ex-boyfriends,

16:40.390 --> 16:42.550
even a student that she failed,

16:42.610 --> 16:44.470
but no one could ever
figure out who did it.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.710
Do you think maybe
that-that's why I'm here?

16:46.920 --> 16:48.190
Maybe I'm supposed
to help them find

16:48.240 --> 16:49.400
the person who did it.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.130
What are you talking about?

16:52.430 --> 16:54.890
You're here because
this is your life.

16:55.330 --> 16:58.030
You're here because
you've always been here.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.730
You keep saying that.

17:00.030 --> 17:02.880
You believe that,
but I am telling you,

17:03.110 --> 17:05.900
to me, I just woke
up in this place.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.890
I don't know,
may... maybe I'm ill, okay?

17:09.950 --> 17:11.530
Maybe there is something
wrong with my brain.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.410
Maybe there has been
something wrong with my brain

17:13.460 --> 17:15.150
for the last ten years of my life.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.910
Listen, the night that Mrs.
Kerrigan died,

17:18.280 --> 17:19.730
you told your mom

17:19.829 --> 17:21.990
that you were having some
problems with your memory,

17:22.060 --> 17:25.940
and we took you to see a specialist,
a neurologist,

17:26.440 --> 17:27.810
and he did every test.

17:27.869 --> 17:31.020
He ran every test he could and
he didn't find anything wrong.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.380
And you've been fine ever since--

17:32.420 --> 17:34.380
no blackouts till today.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.810
I-I suppose we could
run some more tests.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.260
I'm sorry, okay?

17:42.310 --> 17:44.500
It's just, I am so scared.

17:44.970 --> 17:46.380
So much time has gone by.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.920
I have lost so many
memories already,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.810
and I just-- I don't...
I don't want to lose anymore.

17:54.230 --> 17:56.740
First thing tomorrow,
we'll take you to another doctor,

17:57.800 --> 18:00.560
but in the meantime,
just remember,

18:01.250 --> 18:05.020
you are surrounded by
people who love you--

18:05.130 --> 18:09.620
me, Daddy, Liam, Anna.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.920
Come on, you-- there you go,
oh. Oh...

18:13.690 --> 18:15.420
I don't want to go home with them.

18:16.990 --> 18:18.230
I want to stay here tonight.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.720
This is, this is my home.

18:20.030 --> 18:21.570
You are my family.

18:21.970 --> 18:25.520
Ariel, whether you
remember her or not,

18:25.740 --> 18:27.710
you have a child now.

18:28.380 --> 18:29.870
We have a grandchild.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.930
Imagine how frightening
this must be for her.

18:34.630 --> 18:38.180
Don't you think your place
should be with her right now?

18:40.220 --> 18:40.820
All right.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.820
All right, oh!

18:43.750 --> 18:44.560
Daddy told me

18:44.600 --> 18:47.060
you're having trouble
remembering stuff today.

18:48.050 --> 18:50.520
You still remember me, right?

18:52.280 --> 18:53.480
Of course, sweetie.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.450
How could anyone forget you?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.240
Good night, darling.

19:01.730 --> 19:03.770
You mean "Good night,
Panda Bear," Don't you?

19:06.260 --> 19:08.380
Panda Bear-
isn't that what I said?

19:09.860 --> 19:10.730
Panda Bear?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.480
Good night, Panda Bear.

19:15.950 --> 19:17.140
I'll see you in the morning.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.200
All right.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.170
She's so beautiful.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.140
Yeah, well, she kind of takes
after her mother that way.

19:31.410 --> 19:32.140
What?

19:40.250 --> 19:41.190
Do you want me to cover up?

19:42.360 --> 19:43.500
Maybe I'll just--

19:43.940 --> 19:44.750
I'll cover up.

19:46.980 --> 19:51.130
Sorry, I just-- I have a
lot of getting used to.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.330
What?

20:13.330 --> 20:15.840
So... let me ask you something.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.620
Um, wow, how do I put this?

20:19.950 --> 20:25.070
Are, are you here... right now?

20:25.310 --> 20:28.450
I mean, am I having this moment,

20:28.910 --> 20:30.210
making this memory

20:30.220 --> 20:31.360
all by myself?

20:32.050 --> 20:35.760
No, I'm here right now, I promise.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.250
Good... good,

20:39.820 --> 20:42.930
because I'm here, too, for you,

20:43.060 --> 20:44.090
whatever you need.

20:47.470 --> 20:50.950
So, another crazy question:

20:51.330 --> 20:54.460
Um, you and me--

20:55.190 --> 20:58.110
as far as you're concerned,
we never, um...

20:59.400 --> 21:00.340
No.

21:01.590 --> 21:04.389
No, I may be the only
woman who has a child

21:04.390 --> 21:06.840
but can't remember
losing her virginity.

21:07.810 --> 21:09.250
My cousin the priest
would probably say

21:09.260 --> 21:10.380
you're the second.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.570
So what do you do for a living?

21:18.900 --> 21:20.410
I manage a hedge fund...

21:21.930 --> 21:23.400
And I'm pretty good at it.

21:25.460 --> 21:28.190
Do you remember how we...?

21:31.350 --> 21:36.050
Um, it was right after Mrs.
Kerrigan died,

21:36.920 --> 21:38.320
and you were pretty shaken up

21:39.590 --> 21:41.520
and I took you to this restaurant

21:42.110 --> 21:46.690
and you started crying right
in the middle of dinner,

21:47.790 --> 21:49.580
and then I felt so bad for you.

21:51.570 --> 21:52.690
But then we just ended up

21:52.980 --> 21:56.680
going to my car and...
and just talking

21:57.070 --> 21:58.380
for a really long time...

22:00.330 --> 22:01.980
And I'm pretty sure that
was the night I decided

22:02.030 --> 22:03.900
I was never going to
let you out of my life.

22:06.930 --> 22:08.280
And you don't even remember.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.680
No.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.950
But, uh, what I...
what I do remember is,

22:18.040 --> 22:19.310
when we were in high school,

22:20.200 --> 22:22.530
and you let me take
a nap in your car,

22:23.170 --> 22:26.120
and you had that orange
key chain, and...

22:27.880 --> 22:30.640
...you put it on my wrist
like it was a bracelet.

22:32.140 --> 22:34.070
And our hands touched, and I...

22:34.850 --> 22:36.120
Guess it just hit me

22:38.490 --> 22:40.720
that you were the one
I wanted to be with.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.850
Okay, so, uh,
sleeping arrangements.

23:05.910 --> 23:07.370
We should probably make a plan.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.530
If you want,
I will stay here with you,

23:09.690 --> 23:12.370
but I'm also happy to go
crash in the guest room.

23:14.780 --> 23:15.950
Guest room it is.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.440
I love you, Ariel.

23:29.460 --> 23:30.330
It's okay.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.170
You don't have to say it.

23:33.710 --> 23:34.810
You just have to know it.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.660
I'll see you in the morning.

23:51.290 --> 23:52.310
Oh, my God!

23:56.230 --> 23:57.030
It's you.

23:59.820 --> 24:00.750
Did you honestly think

24:00.790 --> 24:02.920
I wouldn't recognize
you behind that mask?

24:05.910 --> 24:06.980
No, you can't.

24:08.540 --> 24:09.430
You wouldn't.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.880
Not to the mother of your own son.

24:22.650 --> 24:24.040
You don't remember any of this?

24:24.940 --> 24:26.620
Mrs. Kerrigan's husband
told the police

24:26.650 --> 24:28.390
he was in the Army Reserves.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.030
He was training at a base a
hundred miles away that night.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.340
He's lying.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.059
I don't know. His alibi's good.

24:35.060 --> 24:36.070
That sounds pretty solid.

24:36.360 --> 24:37.320
I'm telling you, Liam.

24:37.740 --> 24:39.190
He shot Mrs. Kerrigan,

24:39.840 --> 24:42.040
and he was wearing a mask,
but she knew it was him.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.100
He said it right
before he shot her.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.590
So, he-he was wearing a mask,

24:46.650 --> 24:48.830
but she still knew
it was her husband?

24:49.440 --> 24:51.180
You... saw that?

24:51.880 --> 24:53.890
She called him the
father of her child.

24:56.160 --> 24:56.870
And don't you see?

24:56.940 --> 24:58.520
Maybe this is why all
this is happening to me.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.909
Maybe if I prove that Mr.
Kerrigan killed his wife,

25:00.910 --> 25:01.790
then all of this...

25:02.960 --> 25:05.170
Memory thing,
this time-skipping thing--

25:05.210 --> 25:06.130
it'll just stop.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.300
I mean, that's how
it worked for my mom.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.460
Okay.

25:13.540 --> 25:15.250
But how do you prove
that this guy's lying?

25:16.200 --> 25:17.400
I mean, that was a long time ago.

25:18.290 --> 25:20.220
Does my mom still work for
the district attorney?

25:21.080 --> 25:22.370
For the district attorney?

25:23.390 --> 25:25.260
No. Not exactly.

25:30.500 --> 25:31.440
Mr. Kerrigan.

25:32.680 --> 25:33.780
Thanks for coming in.

25:33.860 --> 25:34.780
It's, it's been a while.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.140
Mr. Chief of Police.

25:36.290 --> 25:38.740
Yes. I was surprised
to hear from you.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.910
You already know our district
attorney, Allison Dubois.

25:41.950 --> 25:43.460
And, of course,
Manny Devalos was the D.A.

25:43.510 --> 25:44.580
During the investigation.

25:44.780 --> 25:46.570
Mr. Mayor, nice to see you again.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.380
Please.

25:48.410 --> 25:52.340
So, uh, don't keep
me in suspense here.

25:53.670 --> 25:54.520
What's going on?

25:55.510 --> 25:56.370
As you know,

25:56.430 --> 25:58.950
my daughter Ariel was
actually there that night.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.289
It's been our mutual frustration
that's she's never been able

26:03.290 --> 26:05.070
to remember anything
at all about it.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.520
Yes, of course, I remember.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.890
How is Ariel, by the way?

26:09.560 --> 26:12.120
She was always my son's
favorite babysitter.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.370
Oh, she's fine, thank you.

26:15.930 --> 26:17.740
As a matter of fact,
she's finally starting

26:17.741 --> 26:19.950
to recover memories
from that night.

26:21.140 --> 26:22.050
Are you serious?

26:24.120 --> 26:25.890
Well, that's... that's amazing.

26:25.930 --> 26:28.870
Does she... Does she
know who killed Lisa?

26:29.140 --> 26:30.390
Actually, she does.

26:31.650 --> 26:32.770
In light of that,

26:32.820 --> 26:34.790
we thought it might be productive

26:34.820 --> 26:36.360
to talk to you, see if there was

26:36.510 --> 26:38.430
any chance you would like
to revisit your account

26:38.470 --> 26:40.120
of where you were on
the night in question.

26:41.180 --> 26:43.430
What do you mean?
Why would I want to do that?

26:43.600 --> 26:44.430
With all due

26:44.480 --> 26:45.790
respect, Mr. Kerrigan,

26:46.380 --> 26:49.620
your, uh, alibi was
never exactly airtight.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.580
I was in the Army Reserves.

26:55.720 --> 26:59.950
I was stationed 130
miles away that night.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.540
Is Ariel seriously saying
that I killed Lisa?

27:03.620 --> 27:04.389
We're all aware

27:04.390 --> 27:06.170
that you supposed to be
sleeping at the base that night,

27:07.020 --> 27:09.400
but the sergeant in charge
noted here that you weren't

27:09.401 --> 27:11.530
at that afternoon's
marksmanship drill.

27:12.050 --> 27:14.870
You also missed final
bed check that night.

27:15.340 --> 27:16.540
I was doing extra...

27:16.580 --> 27:17.950
...phys... Extra
physical training.

27:18.210 --> 27:20.320
By yourself in the
middle of the night.

27:20.350 --> 27:21.500
We remember your deposition.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.840
But that leaves an awfully
big hole in your day.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.050
A man could get a lot of
driving done in that time.

27:28.470 --> 27:29.860
What the hell is going on here?

27:30.460 --> 27:32.480
What, are you two up for
reelection or something?

27:32.820 --> 27:34.610
Are you trying to
grab some headlines?

27:34.670 --> 27:35.290
What's going on is,

27:35.320 --> 27:37.310
we're offering you a chance
to cooperate with us.

27:37.490 --> 27:41.170
You tell us the truth,
you can expect a little leniency.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.010
But either way,

27:42.050 --> 27:44.419
my office is going to pursue
this theory of investigation

27:44.420 --> 27:45.600
to its conclusion.

27:46.730 --> 27:47.740
I can't believe

27:47.741 --> 27:49.360
you people are making me do this.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.300
You're right.

27:57.970 --> 28:00.020
I didn't tell the truth about
where I was that night.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.100
I was seeing someone

28:03.110 --> 28:04.300
near the base, a woman.

28:06.140 --> 28:08.519
We met when I first
joined the Army Reserves,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.270
and every time I
went up there, I...

28:11.470 --> 28:14.130
I made sure I got the
chance to see her.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.500
Even if it meant slipping
a 20 to the guard on post

28:17.501 --> 28:19.750
so that I could slip
off base for a while.

28:21.750 --> 28:23.109
I never told you

28:23.110 --> 28:24.939
because I didn't think I had to.

28:24.940 --> 28:28.430
I didn't think I had to
because I didn't kill my wife,

28:28.440 --> 28:30.799
and because I had hoped

28:30.800 --> 28:32.489
to spare her family the knowledge

28:32.490 --> 28:34.080
that I was sleeping
with another woman

28:34.081 --> 28:35.580
on the night she was murdered.

28:37.110 --> 28:39.350
This woman you were seeing-
can she confirm that?

28:39.360 --> 28:40.380
Yes.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.790
Her name's Rebecca Moore.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.739
I haven't seen her since
I left the Reserves,

28:46.740 --> 28:50.679
and we didn't exactly
leave it on good terms,

28:50.680 --> 28:53.240
but I don't think she wants
to see me go away for murder.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.660
Ariel?

29:04.660 --> 29:05.840
You don't remember me?

29:06.580 --> 29:07.470
Brendan Kerrigan.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.760
You used to babysit for me.

29:09.300 --> 29:11.940
Oh, uh, of course I-I remember.

29:11.980 --> 29:12.800
I just, um...

29:19.030 --> 29:21.560
I don't understand why
you're doing this to me.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.949
Either you are a very confused

29:24.950 --> 29:27.330
or a very malicious, young lady.

29:28.570 --> 29:29.980
Why are you mad at Ariel, Dad?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.550
Because she made a mistake.

29:33.490 --> 29:36.620
A terrible, hurtful mistake.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.130
Come on, son.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.160
Surprise! MAN: Happy birthday!

30:03.560 --> 30:04.960
Oh, your twenty-fifth.

30:06.450 --> 30:07.430
It was a fun night.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.780
Happy birthday.
WOMAN: Happy birthday.

30:09.830 --> 30:11.240
Well, I'll have to
take your word for it.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.280
I was just kind of hoping

30:14.281 --> 30:16.600
that some old movies would
jog my memory, but...

30:19.690 --> 30:20.520
Nothing?

30:22.340 --> 30:23.170
It's weird.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.340
These people are my friends.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.940
You know, they... Yeah.

30:27.010 --> 30:28.200
...know me, I know them,

30:28.310 --> 30:31.470
but I couldn't tell you
one of their names.

30:33.170 --> 30:34.140
You know what you need?

30:35.430 --> 30:36.370
Wine.

30:37.090 --> 30:39.259
I know you're only 16, sort of,

30:39.260 --> 30:41.969
but the 26-year-old you
has a glass of Merlot

30:41.970 --> 30:43.059
when she can't sleep.

30:43.060 --> 30:43.980
Trust me.

30:44.860 --> 30:45.730
Works every time.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.899
Got a bottle I've
been holding on to

30:47.900 --> 30:48.910
for a special occasion.

30:50.620 --> 30:52.320
Does amnesia count as
a special occasion?

30:58.570 --> 30:59.850
Thank you.

31:01.330 --> 31:02.349
Oh, my gosh, we're at dinner,

31:02.350 --> 31:03.829
and she's, like,
"Oh, I'm so tired."

31:03.830 --> 31:05.309
I'm, like, "What,
tired? You can't be tired!"

31:05.310 --> 31:06.660
You're the one who
said you had to work.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.510
Ariel?

31:08.710 --> 31:10.180
Hey. Your mom's on the phone.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.710
Oh, I'll take it in here.

31:17.390 --> 31:18.130
Hello?

31:18.300 --> 31:19.680
Sweetie, I know it's late.

31:19.770 --> 31:21.190
I need you to come
over here right now.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.600
Can you do that, please?

31:22.710 --> 31:24.150
Hey, Mom, what's going on?
You okay?

31:24.190 --> 31:26.000
I'm fine, but I need you here.

31:26.070 --> 31:27.900
I need to speak to you in person.

31:27.950 --> 31:28.750
But-but why?

31:28.820 --> 31:29.910
I just had a dream, Ariel.

31:29.980 --> 31:31.150
I know what's going on.

31:31.630 --> 31:32.730
Everything that's happened to you,

31:32.770 --> 31:35.610
everything you've gone through-
I think I understand it now.

31:35.710 --> 31:37.020
It's about Brendan Kerrigan.

31:37.250 --> 31:39.340
I was always about
Brendan Kerrigan.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.010
Wait. I don't understand
what you're saying to me.

31:41.050 --> 31:42.310
What's about Brendan?

31:42.450 --> 31:44.340
I know who killed
his mother, Ariel.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.060
I know who killed Mrs. Kerrigan.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.810
But I need to explain it to
you in person. I need to...

31:52.310 --> 31:53.100
Mom?

31:54.930 --> 31:55.820
Can we go now?

31:58.800 --> 31:59.800
Anna, is that you?

32:01.330 --> 32:03.770
Mom, who else would I be?

32:06.240 --> 32:07.170
What is it?

32:07.280 --> 32:09.180
You look like you're gonna
be sick or something.

32:11.860 --> 32:12.960
I was just at home,

32:13.680 --> 32:15.530
and I was about to go see Grandma.

32:17.050 --> 32:18.510
We did go see Grandma.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.280
She's right there.

32:22.890 --> 32:26.370
AAA

32:36.030 --> 32:36.780
Hey.

32:37.990 --> 32:38.720
Where is she?

32:39.020 --> 32:39.800
Inside.

32:40.580 --> 32:41.910
What's wrong with her, Daddy?

33:01.790 --> 33:02.900
Seven years.

33:05.340 --> 33:07.630
My mother's been
dead for seven years.

33:11.890 --> 33:12.890
She was murdered.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.740
My dad was out of
town on business.

33:26.490 --> 33:27.660
Burglar came in the house

33:27.700 --> 33:29.860
and shot her in the
back of the head.

33:35.620 --> 33:36.650
Never caught him.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.650
I know.

33:43.570 --> 33:44.480
I didn't.

33:54.190 --> 33:54.950
Apparently,

33:55.010 --> 33:57.370
it happened the night she called
to tell me about her dream.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.910
She said she knew what
all this was about.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.670
Everything that was
happening to me.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.420
She was just about
to tell me, and...

34:10.670 --> 34:12.020
...then I was in the cemetery.

34:15.230 --> 34:17.460
With Anna seven years later

34:17.500 --> 34:18.550
just like that.

34:28.850 --> 34:30.590
I don't know if I could go
through this again, Ariel.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.560
The last time this happened,

34:33.630 --> 34:35.110
you never got your memories back.

34:36.920 --> 34:37.880
And you and me-- we...

34:38.900 --> 34:40.870
We had to start over.

34:42.909 --> 34:44.760
I know you don't remember,

34:46.170 --> 34:46.929
but...

34:48.050 --> 34:48.969
It was...

34:51.610 --> 34:52.460
...tough.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.010
: You sound angry with me...

34:58.730 --> 35:00.840
I'm not angry, Ariel.

35:00.990 --> 35:01.730
I'm not.

35:02.830 --> 35:03.780
I'm just tired.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.160
Okay, so who killed Mrs. Kerrigan?

35:14.740 --> 35:17.140
When my mother called,
she said she knew who killed her,

35:17.650 --> 35:19.280
and then, I just blanked out.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.129
We never finished
our conversation,

35:21.130 --> 35:23.110
but that doesn't mean
it wasn't finished.

35:26.330 --> 35:28.560
Your mother wanted to
speak to you in person,

35:29.560 --> 35:30.760
so you left.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.590
By the time you got to her house,

35:35.010 --> 35:36.090
she was dead.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.710
You were the one
who found her body.

35:56.300 --> 35:58.490
Okay, uh, the last thing
that she said to me

35:59.160 --> 36:02.540
was that everything was
because of Brendan Kerrigan.

36:02.610 --> 36:04.380
That-that it's all about him.

36:07.180 --> 36:08.380
So maybe he knows something.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.850
Maybe he, uh...

36:10.470 --> 36:13.650
Maybe he learned something
about what happened to his mom.

36:14.490 --> 36:17.640
I have to talk to him,
or I may-may never find out.

36:17.700 --> 36:18.999
My God, Ariel, do you really want

36:19.000 --> 36:20.880
to upset those poor
people all over again?

36:21.360 --> 36:22.250
Those poor people.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.370
What about us?

36:27.220 --> 36:28.160
What about me?

36:28.950 --> 36:29.720
Ariel.

36:31.980 --> 36:35.310
Please... just let it go.

36:37.340 --> 36:38.600
Let it go and stay with me.

36:39.940 --> 36:40.820
Stay with Anna.

36:42.330 --> 36:45.300
I'm begging you,
for the sake of our family.

36:47.340 --> 36:48.160
I...

36:49.140 --> 36:50.270
I can't.

36:58.070 --> 36:59.980
Ariel. What do you want?

37:00.930 --> 37:02.970
I know I'm the last
person you want to see,

37:03.730 --> 37:06.850
but I wouldn't have come UN

37:09.570 --> 37:11.060
I need to speak to your son.

37:11.570 --> 37:14.200
And what could you and Brendan
possibly have to discuss?

37:14.650 --> 37:17.640
I'm not sure, not exactly,
but I think it has to do

37:17.690 --> 37:19.140
with what happened to Mrs.
Kerrigan.

37:19.710 --> 37:22.010
The last thing that
my mom said to me

37:22.040 --> 37:22.990
before she died was

37:23.040 --> 37:24.430
that Brendan was the
key to everything,

37:24.470 --> 37:26.800
that he had always been
the key to everything.

37:26.920 --> 37:27.550
Really?

37:28.040 --> 37:31.320
Ariel, your mom was
killed seven years ago.

37:31.370 --> 37:32.460
Why are you coming here now?

37:33.670 --> 37:35.660
I need to talk to your son,
please.

37:37.050 --> 37:38.130
I think you should go.

37:39.190 --> 37:39.880
Dad?

37:40.630 --> 37:41.500
Is everything okay?

37:45.970 --> 37:46.880
MRS. KERRIGAN: It's you.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.500
You wouldn't.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.890
Not to the mother of your own son.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.180
My God.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.560
Are you okay, Ariel?

38:06.360 --> 38:07.220
What are you doing here?

38:07.550 --> 38:08.680
MR. KERRIGAN: She was
just leaving, Brendan.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.420
You talked to Brendan?

38:33.480 --> 38:34.370
I didn't have to.

38:36.110 --> 38:37.350
I just had to look at him.

38:40.410 --> 38:41.870
Brendan's your son.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.910
You were sleeping with Mrs.
Kerrigan.

38:44.970 --> 38:45.930
You killed her.

38:46.250 --> 38:47.020
I had to.

38:48.540 --> 38:49.370
She was pregnant.

38:49.420 --> 38:50.690
I was 18.

38:51.820 --> 38:54.170
She wanted to tell everybody
what we were doing.

38:55.310 --> 38:56.460
She kept saying that she loved me,

38:56.500 --> 38:58.390
that she wanted to be with me,

38:58.440 --> 39:00.120
that she wanted
Brendan to be with me.

39:00.300 --> 39:01.640
I was going into college.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.860
I was planning a life.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.090
I couldn't let her
take that away from me.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.180
Or my mother.

39:10.700 --> 39:11.770
I always knew there was a chance

39:11.810 --> 39:13.030
one of you would get to the truth.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.850
That's what I bought into when
I married into your family.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.530
When she called that night,

39:20.140 --> 39:21.620
I listened in on the extension.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.610
I knew she was about
to tell you everything,

39:23.650 --> 39:25.170
so I drove over to her house.

39:25.810 --> 39:27.320
I beat you there by
a couple of minutes.

39:29.260 --> 39:31.380
We're a family, Ariel.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.040
I had to fight to
protect what we have.

39:35.090 --> 39:36.340
We don't have anything.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.800
I barely know you.

39:40.190 --> 39:41.640
You lost that time,

39:42.280 --> 39:43.120
not me.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.170
You might not know who I am.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.460
I know you.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.290
You're the love of my life, Ariel.

39:50.340 --> 39:51.140
Stop it!

39:53.460 --> 39:54.990
You killed...

39:55.060 --> 39:56.140
My mother.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.980
You told Brendan
everything, right?

40:07.830 --> 40:08.820
You didn't?

40:10.120 --> 40:11.010
No.

40:12.980 --> 40:14.140
Why would I?

40:14.770 --> 40:15.750
Because

40:16.390 --> 40:18.530
I followed you here
tonight, Ariel.

40:20.280 --> 40:23.410
I knew that if I wanted
to keep what we have,

40:23.460 --> 40:24.600
I couldn't let you see Brendan,

40:24.640 --> 40:26.810
and the only way to
keep you from seeing him

40:27.080 --> 40:29.310
was to take away
everything that we have.

40:29.690 --> 40:30.720
Oh, God, please.

40:31.130 --> 40:32.210
Please don't.

40:33.170 --> 40:34.290
Couldn't bring myself to do it

40:34.330 --> 40:35.260
before you walked in there.

40:36.370 --> 40:37.710
I love you way too much.

40:38.640 --> 40:39.810
But now I had time to think.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.510
Now I know I have to

40:42.780 --> 40:43.560
for Anna.

40:45.520 --> 40:46.650
I have to protect Anna.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.030
No! Please!

40:55.680 --> 40:57.310
Hola, senorita.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.310
Ready to give that presentation?

41:08.360 --> 41:09.230
Dubois.

41:09.770 --> 41:10.650
What gives?

41:13.490 --> 41:15.360
Hey, what...?

41:17.400 --> 41:19.560
Don't ever touch me.

41:32.070 --> 41:32.980
I just got the call.

41:34.930 --> 41:35.720
It's done.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.530
And he went to the house?

41:45.750 --> 41:46.670
With the gun?

41:48.080 --> 41:49.400
It was his father's.

41:50.640 --> 41:51.700
He told the police

41:51.701 --> 41:54.470
that he was afraid he was
going to lose his scholarship.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.600
That he didn't know
what else to do.

42:00.530 --> 42:01.750
And Mrs. Kerrigan?

42:02.720 --> 42:03.850
She's fine.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.340
I mean, just shaken,
but she's fine.

42:08.730 --> 42:11.260
You know, she's gonna
lose her job over this.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.280
I know.

42:15.970 --> 42:16.870
Honey,

42:17.920 --> 42:19.560
you did the right thing.

42:20.420 --> 42:22.220
You saved a life.

42:29.890 --> 42:30.630
Mom?

42:31.270 --> 42:32.030
Yeah.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.860
Will you call me Panda Bear?

42:42.700 --> 42:45.140
Oh, I love you, Panda Bear.

42:46.530 --> 42:47.910
I love you, Mom.
