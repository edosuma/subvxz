Beauty & the Beast:

00:22.744 --> 00:25.679
I have been hunting Muirfield
for most of my life.

00:25.681 --> 00:28.098
So you were some kind
of guinea pig?

00:28.100 --> 00:29.449
Continually being harvested

00:29.451 --> 00:31.534
for blood and tissue

00:31.536 --> 00:33.453
and anything else
they could take from me.

00:33.455 --> 00:35.058
I still don't know
what you want with me.

00:35.083 --> 00:35.790
You're a cop.

00:35.791 --> 00:37.924
My position can
open certain doors,

00:37.926 --> 00:40.677
but you can go places
that I can't.

00:40.679 --> 00:43.263
If we work together, we can
take Muirfield down for good.

00:43.265 --> 00:45.248
I thought you'd be
more sympathetic

00:45.250 --> 00:47.350
to someone who was
used by Muirfield.

00:47.352 --> 00:51.137
I will be if he really is
who he says he is.

00:51.139 --> 00:52.439
That woman I told you about?

00:52.441 --> 00:54.090
The one who smuggled
me out of Muirfield?

00:54.092 --> 00:56.943
I think she might have been
Detective Chandler's mother.

01:18.834 --> 01:20.133
Yeah, there's a lot to watch.

You, uh, you did this yawn

01:22.587 --> 01:24.120

little cute
nose scratch thing,

You okay?

01:47.079 --> 01:49.312
Yeah.

01:49.314 --> 01:51.915
I mean, my mom has
been gone ten years.

01:51.917 --> 01:53.500
It doesn't matter
how long it's been,

01:53.502 --> 01:55.318
an anniversary
is always hard.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.570
This year feels different.

01:57.572 --> 02:01.091
Different good
or different bad?

02:01.093 --> 02:04.874
Well, you're here,
so that's good.

02:04.899 --> 02:05.296
Hmm.

02:05.297 --> 02:08.798
And I'm not waking up
racked with guilt.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.552
Well, it's the first year
you know you're not responsible.

02:12.554 --> 02:16.439
Yeah, but I'm not responsible
because Muirfield killed her

02:16.441 --> 02:18.024
because she worked with them.

02:18.026 --> 02:20.343
The people that
ruined your life...

02:20.345 --> 02:21.945
My life is far
from ruined.

02:21.947 --> 02:24.514
...who are hunting you
down, she was one of them.

02:24.516 --> 02:27.784
She was one of the good ones.

02:27.786 --> 02:31.621
Okay, so, a little different bad

02:31.623 --> 02:33.456
and good, yeah?

02:33.458 --> 02:36.159
More bad than good.

02:36.161 --> 02:38.628
Which is why I really
don't feel like celebrating

02:38.630 --> 02:41.464
her celestial
birthday tonight.

02:41.466 --> 02:43.032
Her what?

02:43.034 --> 02:44.634
Family tradition.

02:44.636 --> 02:46.753
The idea was,
when she dd,

02:46.755 --> 02:49.255
she was born to the stars.

02:49.257 --> 02:52.642
So, we get together,
light candles,

02:52.644 --> 02:54.427
listen to her
favorite music,

02:54.429 --> 02:55.979
eat her favorite food.

02:55.981 --> 02:58.348
Well, sounds nice.

02:58.350 --> 03:01.317
Except even though we know
she liked '80s power ballads

03:01.319 --> 03:03.236
and pineapple on her pizza,

03:03.238 --> 03:06.806
turns out we didn't
really know her at all.

03:06.808 --> 03:08.742
She lied to me.

03:08.744 --> 03:11.795
And I was her person,
we were so close.

03:13.948 --> 03:15.749
So...

03:15.751 --> 03:18.067
You know what I want
to celebrate tonight?

03:18.069 --> 03:19.669
What?

03:19.671 --> 03:21.671
Our anniversary.

03:21.673 --> 03:24.507
You realize that that's
today, too, don't you?

03:24.509 --> 03:29.212
Yes, the anniversary
of the first time

03:29.214 --> 03:30.746
we saw each other.

03:30.748 --> 03:33.516
Of the first time
you saved me.

03:33.518 --> 03:37.437
So, I'm just gonna tell
Heather and my dad

03:37.439 --> 03:41.357
that I'm busy, and,
um, you and I can...

03:42.810 --> 03:44.310
No, no, no, no, no.

03:44.312 --> 03:46.279
Bailing on your dad
and your sister

03:46.281 --> 03:48.865
is just gonna make you
feel guilty all over again.

03:48.867 --> 03:51.734
Okay, besides, it seems
like you need reminding

03:51.736 --> 03:54.037
that you did know her,

03:54.039 --> 03:56.289
at least
in the important ways.

03:56.291 --> 03:58.641
Yeah, favorite pizza
topping is so important.

03:58.643 --> 04:00.293
Come on,
let's not get caught up

04:00.295 --> 04:03.112
in the bad stuff
from the past.

04:03.114 --> 04:06.249
Today is about
celebrating her

04:06.251 --> 04:07.550
and moving forward.

04:07.552 --> 04:09.302
Right, moving forward.

04:09.304 --> 04:12.305
Which is why I want
to celebrate us.

04:12.307 --> 04:14.507
Uh-uh.

04:14.509 --> 04:16.341
Mm, okay, we can do that

04:16.344 --> 04:18.310
by going
to the cemetery together,

04:18.313 --> 04:20.512
and saying hi to her.

04:20.515 --> 04:22.232
♪ And it's gonna be
my beautiful day... ♪

04:22.234 --> 04:24.934
Well played.

04:24.936 --> 04:26.469
Hey.
Hey, Vargas,

04:26.471 --> 04:28.655
I, uh, I want to go
over the security detail

04:28.657 --> 04:30.690
for the mayor's thing today.
Oh, right, yeah,

04:30.692 --> 04:33.660
there's a lot of details
about the detail.

04:33.662 --> 04:35.695
Listen, I want to apologize
to you for bailing this morning.

04:35.697 --> 04:36.996
I mean, who knew that Marelli

04:36.998 --> 04:39.199
got his morning coffee
near your place?

04:39.201 --> 04:41.751
That was a really good save,
saying that you were checking out

04:41.753 --> 04:42.919
a new gym.
Mm.

04:42.921 --> 04:44.120
I'd believe that we just

04:44.122 --> 04:46.539
ran into each other
if I was him.

04:47.842 --> 04:51.261
Or maybe I should just learn
how to make coffee.

04:51.263 --> 04:53.930
Or we could just go public.

04:53.932 --> 04:55.765
Wow.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.383
Okay.

04:58.802 --> 05:00.937
Tess, there's a spot
open at the 15th.

05:00.939 --> 05:02.555
You would transfer for me?

05:04.109 --> 05:05.608
The spot is for you.

05:07.344 --> 05:10.813
Wow, so you just assumed
that I'd be the one to go?

05:10.815 --> 05:13.283
There aren't as many spots
available at my level.

05:13.285 --> 05:14.534
Right.

05:14.536 --> 05:16.069
But I've worked
my ass off to get

05:16.071 --> 05:17.487
the respect I get
at this precinct.

05:17.489 --> 05:18.821
Yeah, and if
people found out,

05:18.823 --> 05:20.039
you could lose
that respect.

05:20.041 --> 05:22.792
Me?

05:22.794 --> 05:24.210
Both of us.

05:24.212 --> 05:25.879
It was just a suggestion.

05:25.881 --> 05:28.248
Okay, like you said,

05:28.250 --> 05:30.049
we covered with Marelli.

05:30.051 --> 05:31.751
We don't have
to go public.

05:31.753 --> 05:33.386
It's up to you.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.390
I only have an hour

05:37.392 --> 05:39.259
before I have to
be security detail

05:39.261 --> 05:41.394
for the mayor's
park dedication.

05:41.396 --> 05:43.313
Moving forward, remember?

05:43.315 --> 05:45.098
Right.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.317
Let's go give her some lilies.

05:47.319 --> 05:51.104
See, it's just like
we're walking in Central Park.

05:51.106 --> 05:53.573
Hey, we don't get to do that.

05:55.109 --> 05:56.659
What?

05:56.661 --> 05:57.827
Who is that?

05:57.829 --> 05:59.329
Is that Gabe?

05:59.331 --> 06:01.063
What is he doing here?

06:01.065 --> 06:02.999
Well, did you tell him
what today was?

06:03.001 --> 06:04.233
No.

06:04.235 --> 06:05.752
Maybe Tess or Joe did?

06:05.754 --> 06:09.172
So, what, he's paying
his respects?

06:09.174 --> 06:12.258
He was a victim of Muirfield,
and he knows she was, too.

06:12.260 --> 06:13.509
Or maybe he has a thing for you.

06:13.511 --> 06:14.677
What?

06:14.679 --> 06:16.179
Well, you just spent

06:16.181 --> 06:17.413
all that time together

06:17.415 --> 06:18.464
looking over Muirfield files.

06:18.466 --> 06:19.432
Yeah, that was

06:19.434 --> 06:21.017
really romantic.
Well, maybe

06:21.019 --> 06:22.218
he thought it was.

06:22.220 --> 06:24.187
He doesn't know you got

06:24.189 --> 06:25.355
a boyfriend.

06:25.357 --> 06:27.023
Just... we'll
come back later.

06:27.025 --> 06:28.924
No, I am busy later.

06:28.926 --> 06:30.893
Don't you want to know
what he's doing here?

06:30.895 --> 06:34.397
Besides, you're the one who
made this convincing argument

06:34.399 --> 06:36.733
that I should start my
day saying hi to my mom.

06:36.735 --> 06:39.068
And now you want me
to blow her off?

06:39.070 --> 06:41.154
Okay, I'll wait until he's gone.

06:41.156 --> 06:43.122
Give me the calla lilies.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:56.003 --> 06:57.286
Hey.

06:57.288 --> 06:59.455
Catherine.

06:59.457 --> 07:02.642
I wasn't expecting you
to be here so early.

07:02.644 --> 07:04.177
I wasn't expecting you

07:04.179 --> 07:05.762
to be here at all.
Look,

07:05.764 --> 07:07.930
I've been meaning
to talk to you.

07:07.932 --> 07:10.984
Actually, I just
figured it out myself.

07:10.986 --> 07:12.068
You brought calla lilies.

07:12.070 --> 07:13.403
The other day, when you

07:13.405 --> 07:15.488
mentioned your
mother's necklace.

07:15.490 --> 07:18.524
My doctor, when I was a kid,

07:18.526 --> 07:19.993
I called her Vanessa.

07:19.995 --> 07:21.477
I never knew
her last name,

07:21.479 --> 07:23.746
but she had the
same necklace.

07:23.748 --> 07:25.698
My mom was your doctor?

07:25.700 --> 07:27.367
I was too stunned
to tell you.

07:27.369 --> 07:29.535
Oh, my God.

07:29.537 --> 07:31.654
Those...

07:31.656 --> 07:35.291
those experiments
that Muirfield did on you

07:35.293 --> 07:37.794
and those...
those other orphaned kids,

07:37.796 --> 07:39.512
did she perform them?
No.

07:39.514 --> 07:42.382
No, you think I'd be here
with flowers if she had?

07:42.384 --> 07:45.101
I'm here with flowers,
and I'm conflicted about her.

07:45.103 --> 07:46.936
Catherine, your mother
wasn't the one

07:46.938 --> 07:48.438
who experimented on us.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.273
She was the doctor who
came in to check on us

07:50.275 --> 07:51.858
and made sure we were okay.

07:51.860 --> 07:54.527
Honestly, she was
the only truly

07:54.529 --> 07:57.397
loving adult we had,
and I adored her.

07:57.399 --> 07:59.115
That's why I came here today.

07:59.117 --> 08:00.683
But I am sorry

08:00.685 --> 08:02.235
if my being here has upset you.

08:02.237 --> 08:03.786
No.

08:03.788 --> 08:05.988
Um...

08:05.990 --> 08:08.207
today is supposed to be

08:08.209 --> 08:11.044
about celebrating her.

08:11.046 --> 08:14.547
Well, there was
lots to celebrate.

08:14.549 --> 08:17.083
You know she used
to bring us art supplies

08:17.085 --> 08:18.084
to keep us busy.

08:18.086 --> 08:20.720
God, I probably

08:20.722 --> 08:23.306
grew up eating
your leftovers,

08:23.308 --> 08:24.757
watching your
old movies.

08:24.759 --> 08:27.009
That's where all my old
VHS tapes probably

08:27.011 --> 08:28.594
disappeared to.
<i>Airplane,</i>

08:28.596 --> 08:30.646
all the Pink Panthers.

08:30.648 --> 08:33.982
"I thought you said
your dog did not bite".

08:33.985 --> 08:35.400
"That is not my dog."

08:36.938 --> 08:39.355
She had a pretty good
sense of humor

08:39.357 --> 08:40.740
for a biochemist.

08:43.659 --> 08:44.994
Um,

08:44.996 --> 08:46.446
my family,

08:46.448 --> 08:47.947
we're, uh, having a thing

08:47.949 --> 08:49.082
for her tonight.

08:49.084 --> 08:51.918
Just-just small,
if you want to come.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.503
I would love to come.

08:53.505 --> 08:56.089
I'll see if I can
find some of those old

08:56.091 --> 08:57.623
VHS tapes.

08:59.209 --> 09:01.210
If it's all right with you, I'd
like to do something for her.

09:01.212 --> 09:03.579
Maybe replace the headstone.

09:03.581 --> 09:05.598
I noticed it was cracked.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.217
Looks like it's been
that way for a while.

09:08.219 --> 09:09.752
The crack's pretty deep.

09:09.754 --> 09:12.638
Did you guys
have her moved?

09:12.640 --> 09:13.890
No.

09:13.892 --> 09:16.058
I mean, at least
I don't think so.

09:16.060 --> 09:17.777
But then again, I am always

09:17.779 --> 09:19.645
the last person
to know these things

09:19.647 --> 09:21.147
when it comes to my mom.

09:21.149 --> 09:22.198
You know what?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.783
It's beautiful as is.

09:23.785 --> 09:25.735
Maybe I'll make a donation
to her favorite charity.

09:25.737 --> 09:27.403
Just come over tonight

09:27.405 --> 09:29.288
and listen to '80s
power ballads.

09:29.290 --> 09:30.823
That is charity enough.

09:30.825 --> 09:32.608
I like '80s power ballads.

09:36.748 --> 09:38.447
I'll give you
some privacy.

09:38.449 --> 09:40.466
I'll see you at the
park dedication?

09:40.468 --> 09:42.301
Yeah.

09:50.594 --> 09:52.562
Vincent?

09:59.820 --> 10:01.904
Vincent?

10:03.740 --> 10:05.775
Vincent?

10:07.992 --> 10:11.992
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Beauty and the Beast 1x20 ♪</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Anniversary</font>
Original Air Date on May 2, 2013

10:12.017 --> 10:17.017
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> ==

10:27.415 --> 10:28.108
Hey.

10:28.109 --> 10:29.442
Sorry I'm late.

10:29.444 --> 10:31.010
It hasn't even started yet.

10:31.012 --> 10:32.695
It's just, I was at the
graveyard with Vincent.

10:32.697 --> 10:34.947
Oh, right, it's the day.
No, I'm fine.

10:34.949 --> 10:37.283
But he had to hang back
because Gabe was there.

10:37.285 --> 10:39.152
What?
It turns out he knew my mom.

10:39.154 --> 10:41.020
But when Gabe left,
Vincent was gone.

10:41.022 --> 10:43.022
Wait, wait, I'm still on
Gabe knew your mother.

10:43.024 --> 10:45.374
I have been calling and texting,
and no one's been answering.

10:45.376 --> 10:47.160
I don't know
what happened.

10:47.162 --> 10:49.328
Maybe his cell died.
And he just left me there?

10:49.330 --> 10:51.881
You're spiraling
'cause it's the day.

10:51.883 --> 10:54.667
Look, you know, Gabe led the
task force that hunted Vincent.

10:54.669 --> 10:57.470
He probably just took off 'cause
he didn't want Gabe to see him.

10:57.472 --> 10:59.038
Right, you're right.

11:00.341 --> 11:02.725
Hello?

11:02.727 --> 11:03.810
Hey.

11:03.812 --> 11:05.728
- Heather.
- Yeah.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.064
Worst day ever.

11:08.066 --> 11:09.882
I'm here alone,
wallowing in Mom's scrubs.

11:09.884 --> 11:12.068
I'm gonna come and
wallow with you soon.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.187
Um, and I'm gonna
bring someone.

11:14.189 --> 11:16.322
I hope that's all right.
A guy?

11:16.324 --> 11:18.858
No. Gabriel
Lowan, the ADA.

11:18.860 --> 11:20.109
Sounds like a guy to me.

11:20.111 --> 11:21.327
He was a patient
of Mom's.

11:21.329 --> 11:22.778
No way.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.730
And he has a lot of
stories about her, so...

11:24.732 --> 11:26.132
Oh, a shared past.

11:26.134 --> 11:28.234
All right, well,
I'll order another pizza.

11:28.236 --> 11:29.752
Also,

11:29.754 --> 11:32.171
did we ever
have Mom moved?

11:32.173 --> 11:33.539
Moved?
Yeah.

11:33.541 --> 11:35.174
The grave--
her headstone is cracked.

11:35.176 --> 11:36.676
It is ten years old.

11:36.678 --> 11:39.262
And patched. It's
probably just vandals.

11:39.264 --> 11:42.348
Um, I love you, and I
will see you soon, okay?

11:42.350 --> 11:44.884
All right. I love you. Bye.

11:46.253 --> 11:49.388
What? I am
just curious.

11:49.390 --> 11:51.641
You're bringing a guy
to a family event

11:51.643 --> 11:54.777
Vincent can't go to, and wonder
why he's not talking to you?

11:54.779 --> 11:56.612
Oh, my God, he
probably overheard.

11:56.614 --> 11:58.114
And guys are possessive.

11:58.116 --> 11:59.815
Joe's trying
to possess the precinct,

11:59.817 --> 12:01.534
ship me off to the 15th.

12:01.536 --> 12:03.152
What?!

12:10.211 --> 12:12.078
So, what, you're never going
to talk to her again?

12:12.080 --> 12:14.680
Just trying to figure out what to say.
How about,

12:14.682 --> 12:17.133
"Sorry for ditching you at the
cemetery because I was jealous".

12:17.135 --> 12:18.467
I'm not jealous.

12:18.469 --> 12:20.052
I know she's not into him.

12:20.054 --> 12:23.089
No, P90X. <i>I</i> know
she's not into him.

12:23.091 --> 12:25.641
But you went Code Yellow
when he was bonding with her

12:25.643 --> 12:27.093
while you were hidden
behind the headstone.

12:27.095 --> 12:28.460
Tree.
Whatever.

12:28.462 --> 12:30.263
Point is, he can go

12:30.265 --> 12:32.315
to her intimate family shindig,
and you can't.

12:32.317 --> 12:34.517
Are you trying
to make me feel worse?

12:34.519 --> 12:35.985
Vincent,

12:35.987 --> 12:37.436
we all have animal instincts.

12:37.438 --> 12:38.988
I'd be
territorial, too.

12:38.990 --> 12:41.140
Mm-hmm, right.

12:41.142 --> 12:42.825
And I trust my instincts,

12:42.827 --> 12:45.528
and my instinct says
he's up to something.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.863
Okay, he chooses
today of all days,

12:47.865 --> 12:49.282
the day she's most vulnerable,

12:49.284 --> 12:51.117
to tell her
that he knows her mom?

12:51.119 --> 12:52.952
It's-it's like he was waiting
to ensnare her.

12:52.954 --> 12:54.486
Ensnare?

12:54.488 --> 12:56.622
We all know
that he's out to get Muirfield.

12:56.624 --> 12:58.490
Okay, maybe
he lost all his leads,

12:58.492 --> 13:00.293
and now he needs her as bait.

13:00.295 --> 13:03.462
Okay, I like a good conspiracy
as much as the next guy,

13:03.464 --> 13:05.715
and you're not usually wrong
about these things, but...

13:05.717 --> 13:08.050
You know what? I'm not.

13:08.052 --> 13:09.602
Wait. What are you doing?

13:09.604 --> 13:12.188
I'm gonna go to the
park and tell her.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.141
Thank you for all coming out

13:15.143 --> 13:17.276
to the rededication
of East Park.

13:17.278 --> 13:20.313
I'd especially like to thank my
daughter, Jill, who is actually

13:20.315 --> 13:22.348
responsible for making
this day happen.

13:22.350 --> 13:23.849
Jill.

13:25.686 --> 13:27.519
A mother-daughter
event, of all days.

13:27.521 --> 13:30.539
I'm okay.
I'm too distracted by guilt.

13:30.541 --> 13:33.826
You'll explain. You're not
yourself on the anniversary.

13:33.828 --> 13:36.528
It's our anniversary, too.
Oops.

13:36.530 --> 13:38.714
I guess I'd rather "oops" than
something bad happening to him.

13:38.716 --> 13:40.499
You don't think something
happened to him, do you?

13:40.501 --> 13:41.834
You're still spiraling.

13:41.836 --> 13:43.219
It's just "oops."

13:43.221 --> 13:45.921
Hey.

13:45.923 --> 13:48.040
I got the list.
I'm not on it.

13:48.042 --> 13:49.725
Yeah, well, mayor's
having second thoughts.

13:49.727 --> 13:51.260
Look, you want
details, ask her.

13:51.262 --> 13:52.595
She won't return
my calls.

13:52.597 --> 13:54.380
Oh, big freaking
surprise.

13:54.382 --> 13:56.148
Look, I'm not
screwing around.

13:56.150 --> 13:57.733
She better support me
on this.

13:57.735 --> 14:00.186
You don't want to see
what happens when I get angry.

14:00.188 --> 14:02.721
About a year ago,
I encouraged Jill

14:02.723 --> 14:04.390
to donate some warm
winter clothing to charity...

14:04.392 --> 14:07.726
Cat? Baseball cap,

14:07.728 --> 14:09.395
two o'clock.

14:10.748 --> 14:12.915
Vincent.

14:12.917 --> 14:14.750
What are you
doing here?

14:14.752 --> 14:16.419
This place is
surrounded by cops.

14:16.421 --> 14:18.037
I needed to talk
to you.

14:18.039 --> 14:20.456
I'm sorry if inviting Gabe
was insensitive of me.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.124
Catherine,

14:22.126 --> 14:25.090
look, I don't... I don't
trust the guy.

14:25.115 --> 14:25.679
Okay.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.797
He's not into me,
he's into my mom.

14:27.799 --> 14:29.348
That's not what this is about.

14:29.350 --> 14:32.018
First of all, I just caught him
arguing with some guy

14:32.020 --> 14:33.719
over there about a list.

14:33.721 --> 14:35.938
The mayor's aide?
Yeah. He was threatening her.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.923
That's how politicians talk
to each other.

14:37.925 --> 14:39.725
All right, then
he's at your mother's grave,

14:39.727 --> 14:42.528
talking himself into
some intimate family gathering.

14:42.530 --> 14:43.946
He didn't. I invited him,

14:43.948 --> 14:46.265
because you told me
to celebrate my mom.

14:46.267 --> 14:48.617
He's using you.
For what?

14:48.619 --> 14:50.036
I don't know.

14:50.038 --> 14:51.787
Okay, I don't know.

14:51.789 --> 14:53.823
Maybe he's trying to get more
information on Muirfield.

14:53.825 --> 14:55.607
All right?
Maybe... maybe he <i>is</i> Muirfield.

14:55.609 --> 14:57.460
Based on what-- an argument
with the mayor's aide?

14:57.462 --> 14:58.961
I can't put
my finger on it,

14:58.963 --> 15:01.047
okay, but there is something
not right about him.

15:01.049 --> 15:02.548
Well, if it makes you
uncomfortable,

15:02.550 --> 15:03.966
I'll tell him not to come.

15:03.968 --> 15:06.135
Good.
Why are you acting so weird?

15:06.137 --> 15:07.803
The mayor.

15:12.426 --> 15:14.510
Where'd that come from?!

15:16.129 --> 15:19.348
Jill. Jill, come on, come on.
Mom! My mom!

15:57.972 --> 15:59.438
Hello?

15:59.440 --> 16:00.856
Who is this?

16:00.858 --> 16:03.275
It's ADA Lowan. Who's this?

16:12.780 --> 16:14.147
Shot came from that rooftop,

16:14.149 --> 16:16.359
200 yards outside
the contained perimeter,

16:16.360 --> 16:17.894
so probably a professional job.

16:17.896 --> 16:20.446
Which they could've started
planning three days ago

16:20.448 --> 16:22.348
when the press release for
the park dedication went out.

16:22.350 --> 16:24.067
Good. We've got our timeline.
What about the guy

16:24.069 --> 16:26.035
in the hat Chandler was talking to?
That was a vagrant.

16:26.037 --> 16:28.404
Pretty long time
to chat with a vagrant.

16:28.406 --> 16:30.039
Marelli, weren't you
supposed to be watching

16:30.041 --> 16:31.524
the southeast corner, not
who Chandler was talking to?

16:31.526 --> 16:32.575
Oh, says the detective

16:32.577 --> 16:33.693
who spent the entire event

16:33.695 --> 16:35.027
walkie-talking
with her BFF

16:35.029 --> 16:36.696
about God knows what.

16:36.698 --> 16:39.215
Okay, no one's at fault here.
All right? This happened

16:39.217 --> 16:41.834
outside the contained perimeter,
but from here on out, it's on us

16:41.836 --> 16:44.721
to find the person
responsible, so let's focus.

16:45.973 --> 16:47.807
Any word on how
the mayor's doing?

16:47.809 --> 16:51.210
She's still in surgery, but
she's gonna pull through.

16:51.212 --> 16:53.930
He totally knows.

16:53.932 --> 16:55.048
What?
Marelli.

16:55.050 --> 16:56.399
He caught Joe and I

16:56.401 --> 16:57.734
having coffee this morning.

16:57.736 --> 17:00.403
I thought I covered, but...

17:00.405 --> 17:02.989
This whole sneaking around thing--
does it ever get any easier?

17:02.991 --> 17:05.525
No.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.895
Hey, what's up?

17:09.896 --> 17:11.446
I got more on Gabe.

17:11.449 --> 17:12.832
I'm going to disinvite him,

17:12.834 --> 17:14.834
but I need to work
on this case.

17:14.836 --> 17:16.035
No, I got the sniper's phone.

17:16.037 --> 17:17.753
What?
I saw the scope on the roof,

17:17.756 --> 17:19.422
so I went after him.

17:19.424 --> 17:21.540
Okay, he got away, but I
got his phone so I dialed

17:21.542 --> 17:24.260
the last number it called,
and it was Gabe.

17:24.262 --> 17:25.877
You're kidding.
Yeah.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.262
And the time of the call

17:27.265 --> 17:28.681
was right before
the shooting.

17:28.683 --> 17:30.433
Catherine, he was
threatening the mayor.

17:30.435 --> 17:31.584
Do you think he hired him?

17:31.586 --> 17:33.102
I don't know.

17:33.104 --> 17:34.754
Maybe the sniper was calling him
with the go-signal.

17:34.756 --> 17:36.940
Okay, look, the reason I left

17:36.942 --> 17:38.257
the cemetery is because
I had a reaction to him.

17:38.259 --> 17:40.026
Okay, I lost control.

17:40.028 --> 17:43.229
I know you think it's jealousy.
Yes, he can go tonight,

17:43.231 --> 17:45.481
I can't, but you got to believe
me, that's not what this is.

17:45.483 --> 17:47.767
You're sensing something.

17:47.769 --> 17:52.455
Look, I'm sorry I abandoned
you on our anniversary.

17:52.457 --> 17:55.041
And I'm sorry
that I invited someone

17:55.043 --> 17:58.778
to a dinner that you can't
come to... on our anniversary.

17:58.780 --> 18:00.496
Should we call it even?

18:00.498 --> 18:04.834
Okay. Oh, and I need
that phone.

18:04.836 --> 18:06.386
I need to see
if there's a serial number?

18:06.388 --> 18:09.255
Um, maybe not so even.

18:09.257 --> 18:13.643
I, uh... I kind of lost control
again when I heard his voice.

18:17.982 --> 18:19.649
But, uh, I promise you,
that's...

18:19.651 --> 18:21.684
that's not your present.

18:25.489 --> 18:27.323
Look, I get the guy's got
Spidey senses,

18:27.325 --> 18:28.825
but Gabe?

18:28.827 --> 18:30.159
Okay, professionals sometimes
work in pairs, right?

18:30.161 --> 18:31.577
There's one guy
on the ground,

18:31.579 --> 18:32.996
making sure
the sniper has a clean shot.

18:32.998 --> 18:35.198
Well, look at this.
Gabe gets the call.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.033
He goes to the mayor,
he angles her

18:37.035 --> 18:39.168
towards the sniper, when...

18:39.170 --> 18:40.920
Cat, he's posing
for a photo-op.

18:40.922 --> 18:43.155
Then how do you explain his
number on the shooter's phone?

18:43.157 --> 18:45.491
All right, so what's the motive?
I don't know.

18:45.493 --> 18:48.160
Maybe he wanted her job,
or they were having an affair.

18:48.162 --> 18:51.664
God, does being closeted always
have to lead to bad things?

18:51.666 --> 18:54.017
No, it can be exciting
and romantic.

18:54.019 --> 18:57.854
And you are not leaving me
to go to the 15th.

18:57.856 --> 18:59.839
Okay, I know
this Gabe thing is crazy,

18:59.841 --> 19:02.859
but can we at least check his
phone records and financials?

19:02.861 --> 19:05.111
On an ADA?
How we gonna do that?

19:05.113 --> 19:07.513
Wow, this guy is loaded.
Now <i>I'm</i> jealous.

19:07.515 --> 19:09.014
He's just bringing up
the accounts.

19:09.016 --> 19:12.017
He's in.
TJ's fast. JT.

19:12.019 --> 19:14.954
If he hired this guy, it would
have cost upwards of ten grand.

19:14.956 --> 19:16.406
Any large withdrawals?

19:16.408 --> 19:18.091
Any? Uh, try every.

19:18.093 --> 19:19.959
Can a guy really spend two grand
at a salon?

19:19.961 --> 19:22.027
It might be a cover.

19:22.029 --> 19:23.613
Two grand at a salon--
is that for real?

19:23.615 --> 19:25.281
With Gabe? Totally.

19:25.283 --> 19:26.799
So at least we know he's
guilty of being a douchebag.

19:26.801 --> 19:29.034
Wait, wait, wait.
25 grand...

19:29.036 --> 19:32.004
wired to a numbered account
this morning.

19:32.006 --> 19:33.873
<i>What's going on?</i>

19:33.875 --> 19:36.175
You sounded upset
on your message.

19:36.177 --> 19:39.095
This have to do
with those missing VHS tapes?

19:41.047 --> 19:44.067
I'm glad that we got a chance
to bond over my mom earlier,

19:44.069 --> 19:46.652
but I also have
to do my job.

19:46.654 --> 19:51.574
Someone heard you arguing with
the mayor's aide at the park.

19:51.576 --> 19:54.026
Okay.
And I followed up.

19:54.028 --> 19:56.446
The mayor's office said
that you asked

19:56.448 --> 19:59.532
for her endorsement as a future
candidate, and she refused.

19:59.534 --> 20:02.085
That's why we were arguing.
You got me.

20:02.087 --> 20:05.088
I also know that you got a call

20:05.090 --> 20:06.839
from the sniper
right before the shooting.

20:06.841 --> 20:10.242
Wait. Am I a suspect?

20:10.244 --> 20:12.244
Not officially, but...

20:12.246 --> 20:14.263
Wow, Bishop has really
got it out for me.

20:14.265 --> 20:15.515
Joe doesn't know.

20:15.517 --> 20:18.301
This is coming from you?

20:18.303 --> 20:20.269
Well, that is the last time

20:20.271 --> 20:22.171
I show up at your mother's
grave with flowers.

20:22.173 --> 20:23.606
Gabe, I know how badly

20:23.608 --> 20:25.424
you want to bring
down Muirfield,

20:25.426 --> 20:28.277
and mayor of New York--
that's power.

20:28.279 --> 20:32.815
You seriously think I tried
to have the mayor killed?

20:32.817 --> 20:35.818
Look, I know this shooting
must've been traumatic for you,

20:35.820 --> 20:38.104
today of all days.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.288
Or maybe you're just
displacing your anger

20:39.290 --> 20:41.106
towards your
mother about...

20:41.108 --> 20:44.377
You transferred $25,000
to an unmarked account.

20:44.379 --> 20:45.828
How do you know...

20:45.830 --> 20:47.880
Was that to hire a hit
on the mayor?

20:49.833 --> 20:53.386
A private investigator.
For what?

20:53.388 --> 20:55.138
You know the crack
in the headstone?

20:55.140 --> 20:57.006
I actually noticed it

20:57.008 --> 20:59.475
a few days ago.
You've...

20:59.477 --> 21:01.144
you've been there before?

21:01.146 --> 21:02.478
Just once.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.847
Right when I found out
who she was.

21:04.849 --> 21:08.100
When I saw the crack...

21:08.102 --> 21:10.436
Well, you know how cagey
Muirfield can be.

21:10.438 --> 21:14.173
Okay, so what did
this P.I. find?

21:14.175 --> 21:16.659
Well, I was gonna wait until
after the anniversary

21:16.661 --> 21:19.328
of your mother's death
before I told you, but...

21:20.313 --> 21:22.248
...the cemetery paperwork

21:22.250 --> 21:24.917
says your mother's casket
was exhumed

21:24.919 --> 21:26.819
two weeks after she was buried.

21:26.821 --> 21:28.487
So she <i>was</i> moved.

21:28.489 --> 21:31.490
Uh, reason listed
is a gas leak repair,

21:31.492 --> 21:33.759
but there's no
corresponding city record

21:33.761 --> 21:36.712
of any leak or of any
other work being done.

21:36.714 --> 21:40.183
But why?
Why would Muirfield do that?

21:40.185 --> 21:42.334
Maybe they were looking
for something.

21:42.336 --> 21:43.469
Like what?

21:43.471 --> 21:46.255
Catherine,
did you I.D. your mom?

21:46.257 --> 21:47.890
After?

21:47.892 --> 21:49.892
No.

21:49.894 --> 21:51.477
No, I didn't have to.

21:51.479 --> 21:53.546
She was shot right
in front of me.

21:53.548 --> 21:54.680
And the funeral...

21:54.682 --> 21:57.617
was it, um...

21:57.619 --> 22:00.236
was it open or closed casket?

22:00.238 --> 22:02.705
Wait.

22:02.707 --> 22:06.075
Wait, you-you think that my mom

22:06.077 --> 22:07.493
is still alive?

22:07.495 --> 22:10.580
The P.I. can't find
an autopsy report.

22:10.582 --> 22:12.582
No, she was shot.

22:12.584 --> 22:14.634
Three times in the chest.

22:14.636 --> 22:15.718
She could have worn Kevlar.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.136
She was a doctor.

22:17.138 --> 22:18.721
And a Muirfield agent.

22:18.723 --> 22:20.423
Catherine,
when your mother

22:20.425 --> 22:22.207
smuggled me out of Muirfield,

22:22.209 --> 22:25.561
she injected me with something
that slowed my heart rate down,

22:25.563 --> 22:27.713
made it undetectable.

22:27.715 --> 22:30.816
She got me out
by faking my death.

22:30.818 --> 22:33.486
Oh, my God.

22:33.488 --> 22:35.438
She risked her life.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.657
Okay, if she would
do that for me,

22:37.659 --> 22:39.942
then imagine
what she would do to protect

22:39.944 --> 22:41.744
her own daughters.

22:41.746 --> 22:44.163
The casket was closed.

22:47.668 --> 22:50.670
Here it is,
your celestial candle.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.592
Ooh.

22:55.594 --> 22:57.243
Thanks.
It's the one

22:57.245 --> 22:58.578
you saw online, no?
That's it.

22:58.580 --> 22:59.912
It's just hard to get excited

22:59.914 --> 23:01.564
about a candle when...

23:01.566 --> 23:04.601
the ADA can wine
and dine her like Donald Trump.

23:04.603 --> 23:06.519
It's covered in meteorite dust,

23:06.521 --> 23:08.754
which-- you're right--
is nearly stardust.

23:08.756 --> 23:10.190
She's gonna love it.

23:10.192 --> 23:12.392
Besides, Gabe won't be
wining and dining anyone

23:12.394 --> 23:13.810
when he's behind bars.

23:17.781 --> 23:19.315
Hey. You okay?

23:19.317 --> 23:21.901
Your heart's racing.

23:21.903 --> 23:23.486
Maybe she's excited
to see you.

23:23.488 --> 23:25.955
Happy anniversary.
So,

23:25.957 --> 23:28.774
did you find anything out
about him?

23:28.776 --> 23:33.079
Um, you know how you let
everyone from your past

23:33.081 --> 23:37.083
who you love think you're dead
to protect them from Muirfield?

23:37.085 --> 23:38.968
Yeah. What's that got
to do with Gabe?

23:38.970 --> 23:41.588
That $25,000 withdrawal?

23:41.590 --> 23:43.790
It wasn't for a sniper.

23:43.792 --> 23:47.510
It was for a P.I.
to investigate.

23:47.512 --> 23:49.429
There's, um, this crack

23:49.431 --> 23:52.148
on my mom's headstone
that's been patched.

23:52.150 --> 23:54.234
Wait, he paid someone
to investigate

23:54.236 --> 23:55.935
your mom's headstone?

23:55.937 --> 23:58.058
Okay, see, this is
what I'm talking about.

23:58.059 --> 24:00.443
Okay, but it turns out
that she might not be in there.

24:00.575 --> 24:03.493
The P.I., he can't find
an autopsy report.

24:03.495 --> 24:05.662
Wait, what?
Vincent, there might be

24:05.664 --> 24:08.498
a world, this world,

24:08.500 --> 24:11.618
where my mom has done
the same thing you've done.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.536
Okay, now he's got you thinking

24:13.538 --> 24:15.955
that your mom might
actually still be alive.

24:15.957 --> 24:16.989
It was a closed casket.

24:16.991 --> 24:18.374
I was there, remember?

24:18.376 --> 24:20.009
I heard her heart stop.
But what if

24:20.011 --> 24:21.377
she injected herself
with something

24:21.379 --> 24:22.679
that made it seem that way?

24:22.681 --> 24:23.963
It slowed her heart rate.

24:23.965 --> 24:26.015
It's possible, right?
Okay, yes,

24:26.017 --> 24:27.183
it's possible...
And you weren't

24:27.185 --> 24:28.351
focused on her that night--

24:28.353 --> 24:29.602
you were focused on saving me.

24:29.604 --> 24:31.588
I know...

24:31.590 --> 24:33.523
I know that it's crazy,

24:33.525 --> 24:37.143
but I want to exhume her casket.
No.

24:37.145 --> 24:39.229
Vincent, I need to know
if she's in there.

24:39.231 --> 24:40.446
She's not.

24:40.448 --> 24:42.148
I know she died
that night.

24:42.150 --> 24:43.650
She's not in
the grave.

24:43.652 --> 24:44.984
How do you know?

24:47.121 --> 24:49.372
I can... I can just tell.
What?

24:49.374 --> 24:52.225
You can... you can sense it?

24:55.796 --> 24:59.799
I realized the first night
you took me to her grave.

25:00.801 --> 25:03.419
That was months ago.

25:04.722 --> 25:08.141
This entire time?

25:08.143 --> 25:10.310
Just this morning, you said,

25:10.312 --> 25:12.145
"Let's go say hi to her,"

25:12.147 --> 25:14.180
and you knew
she wasn't in there?

25:14.182 --> 25:16.566
I didn't want to open up
a whole can of worms for you.

25:16.568 --> 25:18.718
Okay, you start looking
into this, you're gonna end up

25:18.720 --> 25:20.570
in the crosshairs
of Muirfield once again.

25:20.572 --> 25:22.855
Okay, you don't get
to make that decision for me.

25:22.857 --> 25:25.325
Catherine, my brothers' bodies
were never recovered, okay?

25:25.327 --> 25:27.076
But I still go to their graves

25:27.078 --> 25:29.729
because it gives me a place
to remember them.

25:29.731 --> 25:31.447
It doesn't matter
where the body is.

25:31.449 --> 25:33.499
It matters to me.

25:33.501 --> 25:36.302
My mother could still be alive.

25:36.304 --> 25:37.470
She's not.

25:37.472 --> 25:39.255
All right,
I'm sorry, okay?

25:39.257 --> 25:41.791
But I have no idea
what Gabe's agenda is, and...

25:41.793 --> 25:43.242
you know, maybe he's just trying

25:43.244 --> 25:45.244
to stop you or distract
you from figuring out

25:45.246 --> 25:47.163
that he's trying
to kill the mayor.

25:47.164 --> 25:47.639
Vincent.

25:47.664 --> 25:49.099
I don't want you seeing
him anymore!

25:49.100 --> 25:50.750
What?

25:50.752 --> 25:53.919
What, you forbid me?
What's going on with you?

25:53.921 --> 25:56.139
You're like a different person.
No, I'm just

25:56.141 --> 25:58.758
doing what I usually do,
which is trying to protect you.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.760
All right, you just
spent the last decade

26:00.762 --> 26:03.596
feeling guilty, trying to figure
out what actually happened

26:03.598 --> 26:05.481
to your mother.
Now you're finally

26:05.483 --> 26:07.970
moving forward,
and he's pulling you straight back.

26:07.971 --> 26:10.822
Well, at least he hasn't
been lying to me.

26:10.823 --> 26:13.823
And you can't forbid me
to see anyone.

26:27.888 --> 26:29.922
<i>She had this drawer</i>

26:29.924 --> 26:32.458
full of lollipops,
but they didn't have sticks--

26:32.460 --> 26:33.790
they had strings.

26:33.815 --> 26:35.961
Yeah. Oh, my God.
I remember those.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.963
She thought the sticks
were dangerous.

26:37.965 --> 26:40.233
A kid might fall and impale
the roof of their mouth on one.

26:40.235 --> 26:43.469
Sticks on lollipops
are dangerous.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.638
I hope you don't
mind me asking,

26:45.640 --> 26:47.407
why were you seeing her?
No,

26:47.409 --> 26:49.742
not at all. I, uh,
had a rare form of anemia.

26:49.744 --> 26:50.943
Oh, my God.

26:50.945 --> 26:52.495
So, Dad, Gabe and I,

26:52.497 --> 26:54.497
we went by Mom's
grave this morning.

26:54.499 --> 26:56.432
Together?
Oh, we ran into each other.

26:56.434 --> 26:57.917
There's a crack
in her headstone.

26:57.919 --> 26:59.369
Wait, you're still on that?
Actually,

26:59.371 --> 27:00.503
I looked into it.

27:00.505 --> 27:03.489
Turns out that
Mom was dug up.

27:03.491 --> 27:04.424
What?

27:04.426 --> 27:05.842
I wouldn't say "dug up."

27:05.844 --> 27:07.493
She was moved, temporarily.

27:07.495 --> 27:08.895
They had to fix
some burst pipes.

27:08.897 --> 27:10.346
It was years ago.
Did you have to sign a release?

27:10.348 --> 27:12.031
I'm sure I did.

27:12.033 --> 27:13.349
Can we see it?

27:13.351 --> 27:14.517
Why would you want to?

27:14.519 --> 27:15.868
Uh, my suggestion.

27:15.870 --> 27:17.336
I thought,
you know,

27:17.338 --> 27:19.021
if we can find out
who's responsible,

27:19.023 --> 27:21.607
I can try to get them to replace
the damaged headstone.

27:21.609 --> 27:22.692
All right, well,

27:22.694 --> 27:24.193
I can see if I still have it.

27:24.195 --> 27:25.778
Great.
Okay, so then

27:25.780 --> 27:27.697
we can move on from headstones
and maybe focus

27:27.699 --> 27:28.898
on when Mom
was still alive.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.234
I would love to focus on that.
Yeah,

27:31.236 --> 27:32.285
she looks beautiful there.

27:32.287 --> 27:34.153
I mainly saw her in a lab coat.

27:34.155 --> 27:35.371
She loved
that dress.

27:35.373 --> 27:36.355
I want that dress.

27:36.357 --> 27:38.207
Was she buried in it?

27:38.209 --> 27:41.494
Catherine, can
I talk to you?

27:42.296 --> 27:44.380
Excuse us.

27:44.382 --> 27:46.466
What is going on?

27:46.468 --> 27:48.551
Why didn't you tell me
you exhumed her body?

27:48.553 --> 27:50.586
I didn't think it was important.
It's amazing

27:50.588 --> 27:52.889
how everyone else decides
what's important for me to know.

27:52.891 --> 27:55.541
Everyone? Who's everyone?

27:55.543 --> 27:57.226
You, Mom.

27:57.228 --> 27:59.645
What else aren't you telling me, Dad?
Look,

27:59.647 --> 28:03.099
I-I'm trying.
Y-You got to help me out.

28:04.401 --> 28:07.770
Just tell me
what this is really about.

28:07.772 --> 28:10.606
I'm sor... I'm-I'm sorry.

28:10.608 --> 28:12.725
I'm sorry.
You guys...

28:12.727 --> 28:15.060
you guys should enjoy pizza

28:15.062 --> 28:17.897
and listen to power ballads,
but I can't do it.

28:17.899 --> 28:20.783
I can't do it.
And I'm not mad at you;

28:20.785 --> 28:22.168
I'm mad at Mom.

28:22.170 --> 28:26.923
Why? What did she do?

28:26.925 --> 28:29.292
I think she could have
faked her death.

28:29.294 --> 28:30.960
You...
You know she did

28:30.962 --> 28:33.179
crazy things: she lied
to us about her work,

28:33.181 --> 28:34.797
she didn't tell us
about her research.

28:34.799 --> 28:36.799
I don't even know
if she likes pizza.

28:36.801 --> 28:39.635
You really think your mom
would let ten years pass

28:39.637 --> 28:41.304
without seeing her
eldest daughter?

28:41.306 --> 28:44.607
Considering how little
I actually knew her...

28:44.609 --> 28:47.393
yeah, Dad, I do.

28:47.395 --> 28:50.179
Okay. How can I
put this to rest?

28:50.181 --> 28:53.616
That form you signed,
I want to see it.

28:53.618 --> 28:56.602
If there's a return address
then... the person

28:56.604 --> 28:58.521
who exhumed her might know
if she's in there, could answer

28:58.523 --> 28:59.854
some questions for me.

28:59.879 --> 29:01.308
You sure you want to
go through with this?

29:01.309 --> 29:03.459
Yes.

29:09.917 --> 29:12.451
Looks abandoned.

29:12.453 --> 29:15.671
Looks like another one
of my mother's lies.

29:15.673 --> 29:17.890
Let's go.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.562
So no one lives here?

29:22.564 --> 29:25.515
Seems that way.

29:25.517 --> 29:28.184
There's no water
or power bills.

29:28.186 --> 29:31.020
Owned by
an anonymous trust.

29:31.022 --> 29:33.606
Might be a Muirfield safe house.

29:33.608 --> 29:37.827
Looks like the set
of a slasher film.

29:37.829 --> 29:39.161
It could still be active.

29:39.163 --> 29:41.364
Stay close.

29:41.366 --> 29:44.483
You know what? I think we should
let someone know we're here

29:44.485 --> 29:46.419
before we start
breaking and entering.

29:46.421 --> 29:48.287
You're not gonna get
any bars here.

29:48.289 --> 29:50.206
There's no cell
tower for miles.

29:56.617 --> 29:58.111
This is our
only lead.

29:58.112 --> 30:01.298
You want to find out what
happened to your mom or not?

30:12.126 --> 30:13.293
Okay, check your e-mail.

30:14.395 --> 30:16.762
So, what, now
you're my superior?

30:16.764 --> 30:19.064
Is this so I'll go to the 15th?
All right, I'm not

30:19.066 --> 30:20.783
flirting with you right now.
I.T. just decoded

30:20.785 --> 30:21.896
the sniper's flash drive
and sent it to you.

30:21.897 --> 30:22.950
Flash drive?

30:22.975 --> 30:25.295
Yeah, see? This is why
you shouldn't be transferring me

30:25.361 --> 30:27.495
to another precinct.
And I said

30:27.562 --> 30:28.944
that's your choice.

30:28.946 --> 30:30.813
Okay. Witness found
the sniper's phone.

30:30.815 --> 30:33.399
You got prints?
No, it was totally destroyed.

30:33.401 --> 30:36.602
A car must've run over it, but
I.T. tracked the serial number

30:36.604 --> 30:38.404
to the store where
he bought it,

30:38.406 --> 30:41.123
which was right next to a
highway motel where we found...

30:41.125 --> 30:43.242
Sniper's target profile.

30:43.244 --> 30:44.943
The mayor wasn't the target.

30:44.945 --> 30:47.413
Hello?

30:47.415 --> 30:49.999
Hey, is Cat with you?
No,

30:50.001 --> 30:51.617
she's not at work?

30:51.619 --> 30:53.252
No, look, she said she was
following up on some lead

30:53.254 --> 30:54.453
about her mom.
You know anything about that?

30:54.455 --> 30:57.973
Uh, yeah, I do.
Look, I know

30:57.975 --> 30:59.958
you're peeved that she took Gabe
to that celestial bash,

30:59.960 --> 31:01.727
but you need
to put your ego aside.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.228
It-it's not my ego.

31:03.230 --> 31:04.263
Because our shooter

31:04.265 --> 31:05.648
is actually trying to kill Gabe,

31:05.650 --> 31:06.982
and I'm worried
that she's with him.

31:06.984 --> 31:07.983
Wait, what?

31:07.985 --> 31:09.902
Gabe is the target?

31:09.904 --> 31:11.854
Yeah, it's payback for,
um, building a RICO case

31:11.856 --> 31:14.073
against the Bustamonté family.

31:14.075 --> 31:17.326
I can smell

31:17.328 --> 31:18.494
No, but he was just...

31:18.496 --> 31:19.745
Was standing next to the mayor,

31:19.747 --> 31:20.946
the shooter just missed.

31:20.948 --> 31:22.531
He took the sniper's phone call.

31:22.533 --> 31:23.649
Because most people stop moving

31:23.651 --> 31:25.000
when they take a phone call.

31:25.002 --> 31:26.368
Makes for an easier target.

31:26.370 --> 31:29.038
The problem is,
Gabe is still in his scope.

31:30.040 --> 31:33.325
God.

31:33.327 --> 31:35.127
But did you
double-check the cellar?

31:35.129 --> 31:36.712
And every other
room in the house.

31:36.714 --> 31:38.247
Well, there's got to be
something there.

31:38.249 --> 31:39.465
Photographs, files...

31:39.467 --> 31:41.216
Gabe, I know how
to clear a house.

31:41.218 --> 31:42.834
I am the detective.

31:42.836 --> 31:44.720
Shh.

31:46.357 --> 31:48.357
It's Muirfield.

31:48.359 --> 31:50.259
You're unarmed.

31:50.261 --> 31:51.644
Stay here.

33:02.932 --> 33:04.967
You think he's Muirfield?

33:04.969 --> 33:07.553
He's not Muirfield,
he's a hit man.

33:07.555 --> 33:09.071
Okay, Gabe

33:09.073 --> 33:11.523
was the target,
and he's innocent.

33:11.525 --> 33:12.691
Well,

33:12.693 --> 33:14.193
yet again, somehow,

33:14.195 --> 33:16.228
you were able to save me.

33:16.230 --> 33:18.614
Just like ten years ago.

33:20.201 --> 33:23.285
Let's just not make it
an annual thing, huh?

33:24.788 --> 33:26.905
I'm sorry.

33:34.615 --> 33:36.665
I hate to say
it, but, uh,

33:36.667 --> 33:38.133
Gabe is here, so

33:38.135 --> 33:40.252
you should probably go.

33:42.889 --> 33:46.391
What is that?

33:54.734 --> 33:57.653
Someone's buried
down there.

34:04.244 --> 34:07.696
It's a calla lily.

34:07.698 --> 34:11.083
It's her.

34:12.202 --> 34:15.003
I'm so sorry.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.956
Me, too.

34:20.927 --> 34:22.127
I never should've doubted you.

34:32.358 --> 34:33.824
So, Vincent comes
to the rescue,

34:33.827 --> 34:35.159
and you get
the credit?

34:35.161 --> 34:36.661
This time, yeah.

34:36.663 --> 34:38.746
And I wouldn't exactly
call it credit.

34:38.748 --> 34:40.697
I have to explain
a broken neck

34:40.699 --> 34:41.916
and a hole in the floor.

34:41.918 --> 34:43.367
What about DNA?

34:43.369 --> 34:44.869
Self-defense,
they won't check.

34:44.871 --> 34:46.120
Wow, your relationship
makes mine

34:46.121 --> 34:47.505
seem like a piece of cake.

34:47.507 --> 34:49.373
Thank you for calling him.

34:49.375 --> 34:51.509
Where would you be
if I was at the 15th?

34:51.511 --> 34:54.245
Dead.

34:54.246 --> 34:56.380
Nice work, Vargas.

34:56.382 --> 34:58.249
Thanks.
Lot easier to break a case

34:58.251 --> 35:00.852
when you're doing
the boss, huh?

35:00.854 --> 35:02.520
It was coffee.

35:02.522 --> 35:04.755
I'll drive the ADA home.

35:04.757 --> 35:06.124
Okay. Good night.

35:06.126 --> 35:08.392
I want to show you something.

35:12.397 --> 35:13.798
Here she is.

35:13.800 --> 35:14.982
Why here?

35:14.984 --> 35:16.534
In the middle of nowhere?

35:16.536 --> 35:18.653
And who went to all
the trouble to move her?

35:18.655 --> 35:20.605
I don't know.

35:20.607 --> 35:21.823
So, what are you gonna do?

35:21.825 --> 35:23.407
You can't just leave her here.

35:23.409 --> 35:25.442
If Muirfield cared enough
to move her out here,

35:25.444 --> 35:27.962
and I move her back...

35:27.964 --> 35:30.081
it's just gonna put
my family on their radar.

35:30.083 --> 35:32.133
It's not worth the risk.

35:32.135 --> 35:34.135
Besides, there's a

35:34.137 --> 35:37.038
cracked headstone I've been
going to for a decade.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.157
So, you don't want to know
what happened to her?

35:39.159 --> 35:41.959
No, of course I do.

35:41.961 --> 35:44.011
But with every answer,

35:44.013 --> 35:46.514
there's all
these questions.

35:48.400 --> 35:52.003
It's kind of hard
hearing new stories.

35:52.005 --> 35:54.472
Makes you feel like you weren't

35:54.474 --> 35:57.474
as special as you thought.

35:57.476 --> 35:59.911
You were.

35:59.913 --> 36:02.980
She talked about you
all the time.

36:02.982 --> 36:05.199
I know you were
Rosa Parks

36:05.201 --> 36:07.502
in your second grade play,

36:07.504 --> 36:10.421
that you broke your arm
on a Slip 'n Slide,

36:10.423 --> 36:12.256
that you hated
to practice violin.

36:12.258 --> 36:14.325
So much.

36:14.327 --> 36:16.627
She thought you hung the moon.

36:19.097 --> 36:20.831
You were great.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.717
We should celebrate.

36:24.436 --> 36:27.104
I don't feel like celebrating.

36:28.473 --> 36:30.341
I don't want a transfer.

36:30.343 --> 36:31.726
I just got my
partnership

36:31.728 --> 36:33.394
back with Cat,
and like you said,

36:33.396 --> 36:34.612
we're doing pretty well.

36:34.614 --> 36:35.897
But you're right,

36:35.899 --> 36:37.565
it makes me look bad
if we go public,

36:37.567 --> 36:39.367
and it's not good
for you either.

36:41.187 --> 36:42.904
So?

36:42.906 --> 36:44.688
So we just need
to be more careful.

36:44.690 --> 36:47.858
Like, I shouldn't even
be in here right now.

36:47.860 --> 36:49.911
You're right.

36:49.913 --> 36:51.879
You know what, forget the 15th.

36:51.881 --> 36:53.831
Besides, the spot's been taken.

36:53.833 --> 36:55.800
I, uh, I believe
Detective Marelli

36:55.802 --> 36:57.201
will be very happy there.

36:57.203 --> 36:59.554
Marelli?
Mm.

36:59.556 --> 37:01.923
Did you...
Oh, I did.

37:01.925 --> 37:03.207
You know, you can't transfer

37:03.209 --> 37:04.976
everyone who knows about us.

37:04.978 --> 37:08.729
Oh, that's why I bought you
a coffeemaker.

37:08.731 --> 37:10.381
Don't come near me.

37:10.383 --> 37:13.267
What?
The blinds are open.

37:26.582 --> 37:28.299
Oh, my God.

37:28.301 --> 37:30.668
Well, I, uh...

37:30.670 --> 37:32.703
I had to make up for the fact

37:32.705 --> 37:35.656
that the first present
I got you, um...

37:35.658 --> 37:37.375
I kind of broke it.

37:37.377 --> 37:40.077
It was, um, it was
supposed to be

37:40.079 --> 37:41.912
a celestial candle.

37:41.914 --> 37:44.465
So you made me
a celestial sky.

37:44.467 --> 37:46.801
Yeah.

37:48.586 --> 37:50.721
Happy anniversary.

37:52.225 --> 37:57.261
♪ Meet

37:57.263 --> 37:59.596
♪ Me there

37:59.598 --> 38:01.365

38:05.361 --> 38:10.030
You are the best boyfriend ever.

38:10.032 --> 38:12.366
And clearly I should know by now

38:12.368 --> 38:14.251
to trust your instincts.

38:14.253 --> 38:16.120
Actually, not always.

38:16.122 --> 38:18.205
So, it was a good thing
that I thought

38:18.207 --> 38:20.007
my mother was alive
for 12 hours?

38:20.009 --> 38:21.842
No, but...

38:22.677 --> 38:24.295
My instinct is always

38:24.297 --> 38:26.246
gonna be to protect you.

38:26.248 --> 38:28.415
But sometimes,

38:28.417 --> 38:30.601
that's not fair to you.

38:31.970 --> 38:35.106
I should've told you
about your mom.

38:35.108 --> 38:36.857
I get why you didn't.

38:36.859 --> 38:39.944
No, you need to pursue answers.

38:39.946 --> 38:42.980
And even if that means you need
to hang out with the ADA,

38:42.982 --> 38:47.067
I shouldn't keep you
from doing that.

38:48.320 --> 38:49.603
I'll just be here for you

38:49.605 --> 38:51.572
when you realize
the error of your ways.

38:53.826 --> 38:59.613
♪ Who am I,
who am I ♪

38:59.615 --> 39:01.949
You know, if it
makes you feel any better,

39:01.951 --> 39:06.170
I think I was a little
jealous of Gabe, too.

39:06.172 --> 39:09.924
I was always
my mom's person.

39:09.926 --> 39:11.926
You know, whenever it was,

39:11.928 --> 39:14.228
"Who's gonna go
to the market with Mom?",

39:14.230 --> 39:15.796
it was me.

39:15.798 --> 39:17.731
If there was ever
a family debate,

39:17.733 --> 39:20.067
we were always
on the same side.

39:21.853 --> 39:24.605
And then, Gabe shows up

39:24.607 --> 39:26.357
with his...

39:26.359 --> 39:29.577
stories of his time with her.

39:29.579 --> 39:31.862
Maybe that's why I went

39:31.864 --> 39:34.248
a little Code Yellow
at her party.

39:34.250 --> 39:36.817
You went Code Yellow?

39:36.819 --> 39:39.420
You're not the only one
with a temper.

39:41.174 --> 39:44.842
But I'm not jealous
of him anymore.

39:44.844 --> 39:48.596
And you shouldn't be, either.

39:50.632 --> 39:52.666
I mean,

39:52.668 --> 39:54.051
look at this.

39:54.053 --> 39:55.319
Yeah.

39:55.321 --> 39:58.472

about that guy, though.

40:05.364 --> 40:06.397
Okay, shut up.

40:42.735 --> 40:45.236

40:48.820 --> 40:51.705
