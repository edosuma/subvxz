02:56.009 --> 02:58.803
Look, what is this? I'm supposed to...

04:50.791 --> 04:54.210
I am Zao. You are late.

04:55.587 --> 05:00.049
Mr. Van Bierk. I've been
looking forward to this meeting.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.801
Me, too.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.930
My African military friends owe you
many thanks, Colonel Moon.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.851
Few men have the guts to trade
conflict diamonds since the UN embargo.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.230
I know all about the UN.
I studied at Oxford and Harvard.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.108
Majored in Western hypocrisy.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.405
From your modest little collection of cars,
I would never have guessed.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.744
- Show me the diamonds.
- Show me the weapons.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.598
Hiding weapons in the de-militarized zone.

05:50.100 --> 05:54.770
It's a bit of a minefield out there.
- America's cultural contribution.

05:54.855 --> 05:59.775
One million landmines and
my hovercrafts float right over them.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.586
RPGs, flamethrowers, automatic weapons,

06:18.670 --> 06:20.713
and enough ammunition
to run a small war.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.090
My diamonds?

06:36.772 --> 06:38.397
Don't blow it all at once.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.567
I have special plans for this consignment.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.045
His name is James Bond,
a British assassin.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.183
Mr. Van Bierk,
let me show you something.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.983
Our new tank buster.
Depleted uranium shells, naturally.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.193
Naturally.

07:37.916 --> 07:42.044
And how do you propose to kill me now,
Mr. Bond?

07:46.883 --> 07:51.720
It's pathetic that you British still believe
you have the right to police the world.

07:51.805 --> 07:56.642
But you will not live to see the day
all Korea is ruled by the North.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.726
Then you and I have something
in common.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.083
Saved by the bell.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.065
My son is dead.

13:41.112 --> 13:44.823
I'm gonna wake up
Yes and no

13:44.908 --> 13:48.619
I'm gonna kiss
Some of part of

13:48.828 --> 13:52.456
I'm gonna keep this secret

13:52.540 --> 13:56.084
I'm gonna close my body now

13:56.586 --> 14:00.422
I guess I die another day

14:00.673 --> 14:04.259
I guess I die another day

14:04.594 --> 14:08.180
I guess I die another day

14:08.431 --> 14:11.350
I guess I die another day

14:11.434 --> 14:15.270
I guess I'll die another day
Another day

14:15.355 --> 14:18.982
I guess I'll die another day
Another day

14:19.067 --> 14:22.861
I guess I'll die another day
Another day

14:22.946 --> 14:25.489
I guess I'll die another day

14:25.573 --> 14:26.907
Sigmund Freud

14:29.535 --> 14:33.789
Analyze this, analyze this
Analyze this

14:35.291 --> 14:39.086
I'm gonna break the cycle

14:39.170 --> 14:43.048
I'm gonna shake up the system

14:43.132 --> 14:46.885
I'm gonna destroy my ego

14:46.970 --> 14:50.347
I'm gonna close my body now

14:50.431 --> 14:52.182
Uh, uh

14:52.267 --> 14:55.060
I'll think I'll find another way

14:56.312 --> 14:58.522
There's so much more to know

15:00.149 --> 15:02.776
I guess I'll die another day

15:03.987 --> 15:06.363
It's not my time to go

15:07.907 --> 15:10.617
For every sin I'll have to pay

15:11.786 --> 15:14.579
I've come to work I've come to play

15:15.665 --> 15:18.333
I think I'll find another way

15:19.460 --> 15:21.753
It's not my time to go

15:31.514 --> 15:35.183
I'm gonna avoid the clichÃ©

15:35.393 --> 15:39.104
I'm gonna suspend my senses

15:39.230 --> 15:43.025
I'm gonna delay my pleasure

15:43.192 --> 15:46.528
I'm gonna close my body now

15:47.238 --> 15:50.699
I guess, die another day

15:51.159 --> 15:54.703
I guess I'll die another day

15:55.038 --> 15:58.498
I guess, die another day

15:58.875 --> 16:02.127
I guess I'll die another day

16:02.211 --> 16:04.880
I think I'll find another way

16:06.049 --> 16:08.133
There's so much more to know

16:10.011 --> 16:12.429
I guess I'll die another day

16:13.723 --> 16:15.807
It's not my time to go

16:18.936 --> 16:19.936
Uh

16:24.400 --> 16:27.486
I guess, die another day

16:28.404 --> 16:31.490
I guess I'll die another day

16:32.075 --> 16:35.452
Another day, another day

16:35.953 --> 16:37.412
Another day

16:37.622 --> 16:39.331
Another day

16:39.415 --> 16:40.499
Another day

17:10.613 --> 17:15.325
- I don't condone what they do here.
- Tell it to the concierge.

17:28.673 --> 17:32.843
Still you jest. Defiant to the last.

17:34.554 --> 17:39.182
Your people have abandoned you,
your very existence denied.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.854
Why stay silent?

17:48.651 --> 17:52.571
It doesn't matter anymore.
Things are out of my hands.

18:33.696 --> 18:39.201
- We reach the end, Mr. Bond.
- Spare me the unpleasantries.

18:42.205 --> 18:46.917
Fifty years after the superpowers
carved Korea in two,

18:47.001 --> 18:48.376
and then you arrive.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.339
A British spy, an assassin.

18:54.383 --> 18:58.136
And now the hard-liners have their proof.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.055
We cannot trust the West.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.434
You...

19:06.896 --> 19:08.897
You took away my son.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.608
Your firing squad should have
done the job for me.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.117
I hoped a Western education
would help him

19:21.202 --> 19:23.578
become a bridge between our worlds.

19:24.622 --> 19:30.418
- But all it did was to corrupt him.
- Let's get this over with, shall we?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.589
My son had an ally in the West.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.262
For the last time, who was it?

19:40.763 --> 19:43.098
Who made him betray
his country and his name?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.226
The same person who betrayed me.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.273
Turn around.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.868
Start walking.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.142
Keep walking, please.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.686
Keep moving.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.620
Zao.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.747
I'm being traded

20:52.501 --> 20:53.585
for you.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.421
Keep moving. Keep walking, please.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.634
- Your time will come.
- Not as soon as yours.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.972
Keep walking, please.

21:18.569 --> 21:19.944
Look at him.

21:20.738 --> 21:21.946
Double check.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.199
You'd think he was some kind of a hero.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.409
Reference nine.
Sir.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.209
Section four.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.212
Okay, hold him tight. Got him.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.548
Watch his legs, now.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.343
All right, let's go.

21:51.060 --> 21:54.354
No biological agents
in the prelim scan. He's clean.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.565
Pulse, 72. Blood pressure, 120/80.

21:58.234 --> 22:03.238
Indications of neurotoxins, histamines,
serotonin and enzyme inhibitors.

22:03.739 --> 22:07.951
Scorpion venom.
Note also traces of a venom antiserum.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.495
They'd sting him,
then administer the antidote.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.248
Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.626
Liver not too good.
It's definitely him, then.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.425
Morning.

22:37.565 --> 22:38.690
Welcome back.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.452
Such hospitality.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.881
You don't seem too pleased to see me.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.341
If I'd had my way,
you'd still be in North Korea.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.597
Your freedom came at too high a price.

23:13.642 --> 23:14.642
Zao.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.854
He tried to blow up a summit
between South Korea and China.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.648
Took out three Chinese agents
before he was caught.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.401
And now he's free.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.614
I never asked to be traded.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.242
I'd rather die in prison than let him loose.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.119
- You had your cyanide.
- Threw it away years ago.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.829
What the hell is this all about?

23:35.498 --> 23:38.875
The top American agent
in the North Korean High Command

23:38.959 --> 23:40.668
was executed a week ago.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.297
The Americans intercepted a signal
from your prison naming him.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.051
- And they think it's me?
- You were the only inmate.

23:49.011 --> 23:52.347
They concluded you cracked under torture
and were hemorrhaging information.

23:52.598 --> 23:53.681
We had to get you out.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.522
And what do you think?

24:10.241 --> 24:11.574
With the drugs they were giving you,

24:11.659 --> 24:13.743
you wouldn't know what
you did or didn't say.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.036
I know the rules.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.332
And number one is, no deals.
Get caught and you're given up.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.920
The mission was compromised.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.548
Moon got a call exposing me.

24:27.883 --> 24:31.135
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew about it.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.514
- Whether that's true or not, it's irrelevant.
- No, it isn't.

24:36.308 --> 24:40.186
The same person who set me up then
has just set me up again to get Zao out.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.896
So I'm going after him.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.525
The only place you're going is
our evaluation center in the Falklands.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.028
- Double-0 status rescinded.
- Along with my freedom?

24:50.072 --> 24:51.531
For as long as I deem necessary, yes.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.536
You're no use to anyone now.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.149
He's gone into cardiac arrest.
- Get the crash cart.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.318
Notify his superiors. Now.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.862
He's flat-lining on the ECG.
- Stand by.

26:15.658 --> 26:17.784
200 joules. 300.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.410
We need some CPR.

26:19.495 --> 26:23.706
Get me some atropine.
We're losing him! Stand by. Clear.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.174
I'm checking out.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.720
Thanks for the kiss of life.

26:40.724 --> 26:45.395
Security breach on level
three. All personnel, defensive code red.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.689
Apprehend and detain with force.

26:48.107 --> 26:52.443
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.487
Apprehend and detain with force.

26:54.571 --> 26:58.950
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.952
My goodness, standards have fallen.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.247
No tie, dear me.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.919
My usual suite, please.

27:53.756 --> 27:58.050
Do you have a credit card?
Or even any luggage, sir?

27:59.011 --> 28:02.430
Mr. Bond, so good to see you.
It's been a long time.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.598
Mr. Chang.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.811
Perhaps you could send up
my tailor and some food.

28:08.896 --> 28:12.857
The lobster's good,
with quails' eggs and sliced seaweed.

28:12.941 --> 28:16.652
Mmm-hmm.
And if there's any left, a '61 Bollinger.

28:16.737 --> 28:17.820
Of course.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.492
Been busy, have we, Mr. Bond?

28:23.160 --> 28:27.205
Just surviving, Mr. Chang. Just surviving.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.394
I am Peaceful Fountains of Desire,
the masseuse.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.147
I come with compliments of the manager.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.776
I'm sure you do. Come in.

29:02.783 --> 29:05.368
On the bed, please. Face down.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.497
Yes, of course.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.169
I'm not that kind of masseuse.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.675
I'm not that kind of customer.

29:27.015 --> 29:30.226
You think I haven't always known
you're Chinese Intelligence, Chang?

29:32.145 --> 29:35.690
- Hong Kong's our turf now, Bond.
- Yeah, well, don't worry about it.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.149
I'm not here to take it back.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.030
Put your hands down.

29:43.907 --> 29:48.035
- What the hell do you want?
- Just to help you settle a score.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.539
Zao killed three of your men.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.959
You get me into North Korea,
I'll take care of him for you.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.212
What's in it for you?

30:00.048 --> 30:04.218
Chance to get even.
Zao has information I need.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.312
- I'll have to ask Beijing.
- Do it. Now get out.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.107
Unless you really wanna
give me a massage.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.375
Mr. Bond.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.588
A little thank-you from us.

30:48.639 --> 30:49.680
Cuba?

30:49.765 --> 30:52.600
It seems Mr. Zao has lost himself
in Havana.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.269
If you find him, say goodbye from us.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.564
With pleasure.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.559
I'm here to pick up some Delectados.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.854
Delectados?
We haven't made Delectados in 30 years.

31:38.939 --> 31:39.939
Universal Exports. Check with your boss.

31:48.198 --> 31:49.657
Universal Exports.

31:51.910 --> 31:52.910
Follow me. Your passport, seÃ±or.

32:31.992 --> 32:35.036
I'd come to think the Delectados
would never be smoked.

32:36.538 --> 32:40.458
They are particularly hazardous
for one's health, Mr...

32:40.542 --> 32:43.711
- Bond.
- Mr. Bond.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.549
- Do you know why?
- It's the addition of the Volado tobacco.

32:49.509 --> 32:53.137
Slow burning. It never goes out.

32:57.184 --> 33:00.227
- Just like a sleeper.
- Sorry for the rude awakening.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.524
I love my country, Mr. Bond.

33:05.609 --> 33:09.820
I'd never ask you to betray your people.
I'm after a North Korean.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.906
- A tourist?
- A terrorist.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.201
One man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.245
Zao has no interest
in other people's freedom.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.547
I still have some friends in high places.

33:32.594 --> 33:36.347
Favors called in,
some dollars spread about.

33:36.848 --> 33:41.852
We find your friend is here,
on an island, in Los Organos.

33:42.896 --> 33:46.232
There is a strange clinic
run by Dr. Alvarez.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.984
He leads the field in gene therapy,

33:49.778 --> 33:54.865
increasing the life expectancy
of our beloved leaders.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.284
And, of course, the richest Westerners.

33:59.079 --> 34:01.205
We may have lost our freedom
in the revolution,

34:01.289 --> 34:04.792
but we have a health system
second to none.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.379
You don't seem to have done
too badly out of the revolution.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.630
We all have our ways of getting by.

34:11.466 --> 34:15.844
You'd be surprised how many
government officials come to me

34:15.929 --> 34:19.389
- for real reminders of the decadent times.
- Yeah, well...

34:20.851 --> 34:23.226
- Mind if I borrow these?
- Please.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.355
My sources tell me
this Zao is very dangerous.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.315
I wish I could give you more help.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.154
I could use a fast car.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.280
Mojito, por favor.

35:16.364 --> 35:19.825
Mr. Krug, your admittance papers
for the Alvarez Clinic tomorrow.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.535
About bloody time, Fidel.

35:21.870 --> 35:25.039
Now, round up some more girls
and take them to Room 42.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.711
Unless you want to be known
as Fidel Castrato.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.319
Magnificent view.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.241
It is, isn't it?

36:43.451 --> 36:45.452
Too bad it's lost on everybody else.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.413
Mojito?

36:49.541 --> 36:50.958
You should try it.

36:53.670 --> 36:57.089
Giacinta Johnson. My friends call me Jinx.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.299
My friends call me James Bond.

37:00.260 --> 37:03.971
- Jinx, you say?
- Born on Friday the 13th.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.724
Do you believe in bad luck?

37:07.642 --> 37:11.311
Let's just say my relationships
don't seem to last.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.772
Mmm. I know the feeling.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.402
The predators usually appear at sunset.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.072
And why is that?

37:22.157 --> 37:24.116
It's when their prey comes out to drink.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.495
Too strong for you?

37:29.539 --> 37:30.581
I could learn to like it.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.665
If I had the time.

37:34.044 --> 37:35.461
How much time have you got?

37:36.713 --> 37:40.674
- Until dawn. What about you?
- I'm just here for the birds.

37:43.344 --> 37:47.056
- Ornithologist.
- Ornithologist, huh?

37:48.516 --> 37:50.976
Wow, now there's a mouthful.

37:53.688 --> 37:56.023
So you're gonna be busy tonight
with the owls then, huh?

37:57.108 --> 38:01.195
No owls in Los Organos.
Nothing to see till the morning.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.616
Not out there, anyway.

38:08.578 --> 38:12.873
So, what do predators do
when the sun goes down?

38:15.877 --> 38:17.211
They feast

38:18.755 --> 38:20.547
like there's no tomorrow.

39:08.763 --> 39:11.014
Are you always this frisky?

39:12.308 --> 39:14.601
I've been missing the touch
of a good woman.

39:18.106 --> 39:19.606
Who says I'm good?

40:33.473 --> 40:34.598
What the hell do you want?

40:34.682 --> 40:36.934
- I don't need a goddamn wheelchair.
- No?

40:37.393 --> 40:38.685
You do now.

40:57.789 --> 40:58.997
Okay.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.188
So, you are to have
DNA-replacement therapy.

42:46.272 --> 42:49.107
Let me explain the two phases.

42:49.317 --> 42:53.362
First, we kill off your bone marrow,
wipe the DNA slate clean.

42:54.322 --> 42:55.739
Phase two,

42:55.823 --> 42:58.784
introduction of new DNA,
harvested from healthy donors.

42:58.868 --> 43:02.371
Orphans, runaways,
people that won't be missed.

43:04.332 --> 43:06.917
I like to think of myself as an artist.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.628
And this is when I create.

43:13.508 --> 43:14.800
Thank you.

43:15.760 --> 43:21.765
It is a painful process, I'm afraid,
but all great art is.

43:22.600 --> 43:26.019
I'll certainly enjoy working on you.

43:28.564 --> 43:34.236
Of course, you know, most artists are only
truly appreciated after they're dead.

43:53.381 --> 43:56.883
My father was
a sergeant. We lived in Hampshire.

43:56.968 --> 44:00.095
I have fond memories of the countryside.

45:02.825 --> 45:05.952
Good. Got your attention.

45:10.082 --> 45:12.292
Who's bankrolling your makeover, Zao?

45:14.879 --> 45:17.047
Same person who set me up
in North Korea?

46:15.022 --> 46:17.148
James? What's going on?

46:17.525 --> 46:21.236
Jinx, you gotta get out of here now!
Move! Move!

47:14.999 --> 47:16.333
Move it! Move it! Move it!

47:16.417 --> 47:17.417
Let's go!

48:41.168 --> 48:44.754
You see, my friend,
the chemical composition shows

48:44.839 --> 48:48.133
this is from Sierra Leone.
Conflict diamonds.

48:50.511 --> 48:52.804
There's some kind of marking here.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.890
- "GG."
- Let me see.

49:00.813 --> 49:01.938
Yes.

49:02.898 --> 49:06.151
From the Graves Corporation in Iceland.

49:06.235 --> 49:08.153
That's his laser signature.

49:09.321 --> 49:12.949
A man called Gustav Graves
discovered diamonds there

49:13.033 --> 49:14.993
a year or so ago.

49:15.369 --> 49:17.537
Yet they're identical to conflict diamonds.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.624
What an amazing coincidence.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.755
How can he escape
from a British warship,

49:27.840 --> 49:30.675
right in the middle of Hong Kong
harbor, right under your nose?

49:30.759 --> 49:33.803
- Interesting station, Moneypenny?
- All I got was a storm warning.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.514
You were supposed
to throw away the key,

49:36.599 --> 49:38.725
not leave the door wide open.

49:38.809 --> 49:41.519
Are you implying I had
a hand in his escape, Mr. Falco?

49:41.604 --> 49:44.647
Well, Bond got away real fast, didn't he?

49:44.732 --> 49:46.733
It is what he's trained to do.

49:46.817 --> 49:50.737
Your boy's been very busy in his training.
He showed up in Cuba and torches a clinic.

49:51.238 --> 49:56.409
Listen, you put your house in order
or we're gonna do it for you.

50:11.133 --> 50:12.383
Your drink, sir.

50:14.094 --> 50:16.179
Lucky I asked for it shaken.

50:28.234 --> 50:31.277
London calling
To the faraway towns

50:31.612 --> 50:33.947
Now that war is declared
And battle come down

50:35.324 --> 50:38.493
London calling
To the underworld

50:38.827 --> 50:42.038
Come out of the cupboard
All you boys and girls

50:42.122 --> 50:44.290
- When's he coming?
- I don't know.

50:47.503 --> 50:50.880
- Looks like your man's not gonna make it.
- Actually, he's right on time.

50:50.965 --> 50:53.091
London calling
See we ain't got no swing

50:53.300 --> 50:54.884
'Cause London is drowning

50:54.969 --> 50:59.305
And I live by the river

51:26.792 --> 51:28.251
What a wonderful day to become a knight.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.545
Will you be using your title, Mr. Graves?

51:30.629 --> 51:32.922
No. You know me,
I'm proud of my adopted nation,

51:33.007 --> 51:34.549
but I'd never stand on ceremony.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.843
After an entrance like that,
you can't be surprised

51:37.011 --> 51:40.054
you're being called a self-publicizing
adrenaline junkie, can you?

51:40.139 --> 51:41.889
I prefer the term adventurer.

51:41.974 --> 51:44.225
We've been hearing rumors about
the Icarus space program.

51:44.310 --> 51:45.685
What's the big secret?

51:45.769 --> 51:47.228
It's not a secret. It's a surprise.

51:47.313 --> 51:49.230
But don't worry,
you'll soon be enlightened.

51:49.315 --> 51:52.567
You seem to work 24/7.
Is it true that you don't need sleep?

51:52.651 --> 51:55.695
You only get one shot at life.
Why waste it on sleep?

51:55.779 --> 51:58.615
Aren't you trying out for a place on
the British Olympic fencing team?

51:58.699 --> 52:01.909
- We hear you've been training furiously.
- I never get furious.

52:01.994 --> 52:04.579
As they say in fencing, "What's the point?"

52:04.663 --> 52:06.164
All right, everybody, thank you very much.

52:06.248 --> 52:09.167
I'm sure you'll understand we don't want
to keep Her Majesty waiting any longer.

52:09.752 --> 52:11.836
- Mr. Graves.
- Mr. Graves.

52:25.726 --> 52:26.934
Hit.

52:30.731 --> 52:31.898
That's a hit.

52:35.110 --> 52:36.194
Hit.

52:40.741 --> 52:41.866
Verity?

52:42.743 --> 52:43.993
James Bond.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.287
Your lesson.

52:50.709 --> 52:52.585
I see you handle your weapon well.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.421
I have been known to keep my tip up.

52:59.218 --> 53:01.761
Do you mind? I think I've come undone.

53:04.264 --> 53:05.431
Why not?

53:07.017 --> 53:09.686
Hit. Positions. Play.

53:12.064 --> 53:14.691
Feast your eyes
on the finest blade in the club.

53:16.485 --> 53:17.860
- Gustav Graves?
- Mmm-mmm.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.530
His publicist, Miranda Frost.

53:24.785 --> 53:27.954
My protÃ©gÃ©. Gorgeous, isn't she?

53:29.039 --> 53:30.623
She took the gold at Sydney.

53:31.125 --> 53:33.501
- By default, if I remember.
- Default?

53:34.128 --> 53:36.212
The one who beat her OD'd on steroids.

53:37.339 --> 53:39.090
Miranda deserved that gold.

53:39.633 --> 53:41.884
Now she's teaching Graves
how to win one.

53:41.969 --> 53:43.386
He only plays for cash.

53:44.972 --> 53:47.432
He's won so much,
nobody else wants to fight him.

53:52.813 --> 53:54.313
You wanna meet him?

53:55.649 --> 53:56.858
Absolutely.

53:59.111 --> 54:00.319
Lead on.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.658
- Gustav?
- Verity.

54:07.161 --> 54:09.162
- And Mr...
- Bond.

54:10.748 --> 54:11.831
James Bond.

54:13.709 --> 54:17.712
- Have we met before?
- I think I'd remember.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.591
Of course you would. My mistake.

54:22.593 --> 54:26.345
- Are you a gambling man, Mr. Bond?
- If the stakes are right.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.223
A thousand a point too much for you?

54:33.020 --> 54:34.854
Care to place a bet, Verity?

54:37.691 --> 54:38.983
No, thanks.

54:39.860 --> 54:41.527
I don't like cockfights.

54:43.989 --> 54:45.031
Shall we?

54:46.241 --> 54:47.617
Excuse me.

54:50.662 --> 54:51.954
Best of three hits?

54:54.166 --> 54:55.374
Positions.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.668
Ready. Play.

54:58.170 --> 55:00.087
En garde.

55:08.889 --> 55:10.181
Hit.

55:10.265 --> 55:11.599
Positions.

55:12.851 --> 55:13.893
Play.

55:20.275 --> 55:21.359
Hit.

55:22.027 --> 55:23.236
Two-nil.

55:23.904 --> 55:25.446
Do you want to continue?

55:25.614 --> 55:29.700
- You wanna up the wager?
- How much can you afford?

55:31.078 --> 55:32.745
Let's play for this.

55:34.623 --> 55:36.165
I picked it up in Cuba.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.085
I believe it's one of yours.

55:41.588 --> 55:44.757
My, my. They do get around.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.385
But then, diamonds are for everyone.

55:50.681 --> 55:54.225
Brilliant specimen. Completely flawless.

55:54.309 --> 55:56.769
And chemically identical
to African conflict diamonds.

55:58.814 --> 56:01.357
Then you're about to lose
something very precious.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.611
Positions.

56:07.489 --> 56:09.615
Ready. Play.

56:09.950 --> 56:10.950
En garde.

56:17.749 --> 56:18.749
Oh, dear.

56:21.128 --> 56:22.545
You want to continue?

56:23.297 --> 56:25.339
Of course I want to bloody continue!

56:26.592 --> 56:30.219
But since we're upping the wager,
let's up the weapons, shall we?

56:30.304 --> 56:31.304
Yeah.

56:33.015 --> 56:37.643
Let's do this the old-fashioned way.
First blood drawn from the torso.

58:51.945 --> 58:53.112
That is enough!

58:57.909 --> 58:59.660
It's just a little sport, Miranda.

59:06.168 --> 59:07.752
Seems you beat me, Mr. Bond.

59:12.340 --> 59:14.133
Settle downstairs, shall we?

59:14.760 --> 59:15.760
Miranda.

59:29.524 --> 59:31.650
You're a rare challenge, Mr. Bond.

59:32.360 --> 59:34.487
Look, I'm putting on
a little scientific demonstration

59:34.571 --> 59:36.906
in Iceland at the weekend. Icarus?

59:38.658 --> 59:41.327
Perhaps you could join us. Miranda,
make the arrangements, would you?

59:41.411 --> 59:43.621
Once I've smoothed things over
with the club.

59:44.331 --> 59:45.873
What would I do without you?

59:50.670 --> 59:52.880
Can I expect the pleasure of you
in Iceland?

59:53.381 --> 59:56.008
I'm afraid you'll never
have that pleasure, Mr. Bond.

59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.262
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Someone left this for you.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.392
Place needed redecorating, anyway.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.233
I heard of this place.

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.238
Never thought I'd find myself here.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.408
Some things are best kept underground.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.454
Abandoned station for abandoned agents.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.460
- Your calling card.
- So, what have you got on Graves?

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:15.921
You burn me

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:20.801
- and now you want my help?
- What did you expect, an apology?

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.638
I know you'll do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:27.516
- Just like you.
- The difference is, I won't compromise.

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:31.270
Well, I don't have the luxury of
seeing things as black and white.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:35.649
- While you were away, the world changed.
- Not for me.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.990
You're suspicious of Graves,
or I wouldn't be here right now.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:48.746
- So, what do you have?
- Nothing beyond the official biography.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.457
Orphan working
in an Argentinean diamond mine,

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:56.003
learns engineering, makes a huge find
in Iceland and gives half of it to charity.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.965
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.555
- And his demonstration this weekend?
- Probably just another publicity stunt.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.350
Now, tell me what you know
about this Cuban clinic.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:14.980
Gene therapy. New identities
courtesy of DNA transplants.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:17.858
So-called beauty parlor.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.570
We'd heard rumors of such a place.
I didn't think it really existed.

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:24.657
It doesn't anymore.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:29.119
Zao got away, but he left these behind.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.166
All from Gustav Graves' mine.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.672
I think it's a front for laundering
African conflict diamonds.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:45.010
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is politically connected.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.639
Lucky I'm on the outside, then.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:51.475
Well, it seems you've become useful again.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:58.023
Then maybe it's time
you let me get on with my job.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:21.607
Forgive my mentioning it, 007,
but a perfect marksman

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.901
isn't really supposed
to shoot his own boss.

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.073
Check the replay.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.035
You'll find he's dead,
and she's only got a flesh wound.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.039
There's always an excuse,
isn't there, double-0 zero?

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.793
Give me the old firing range any day,
Quartermaster.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.462
Yes, but it's called the future,
so get used to it.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:48.092
So this is where they keep
the old relics, then, eh?

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:53.138
I'll have you know this is where our most
cutting-edge technology is developed.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.558
- Point taken.
- Must you touch everything?

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:57.810
Does this still work?

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:07.778
- Now, look...
- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:10.489
I'm trying to get to it.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.785
Weapon, please.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:25.462
One pane unbreakable glass,
one standard-issue ring finger.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:26.588
Twist so. VoilÃ .

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:32.928
Ultra-high frequency,
single-digit, sonic agitator unit.

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:34.430
You know, you're cleverer than you look.

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:37.850
Hmm. Still, better than looking cleverer
than you are. Follow me, please.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:42.104
Now, a new watch.
This will be your 20th, I believe.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.481
- How time flies.
- Yes, well, 007,

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:47.776
why don't you establish a record
by actually returning this one?

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:50.237
Your new transportation.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:05.711
- Maybe you've been down here too long.
- The ultimate in British engineering.

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.089
You must be joking.

01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:13.051
As I learned from my predecessor, Bond,
I never joke about my work.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:18.307
Aston Martin call it the Vanquish.
We call it the Vanish.

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:26.023
- Very good.
- Adaptive camouflage.

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:29.818
Tiny cameras on all sides
project the image they see

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.488
onto a light-emitting polymer skin
on the opposite side.

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:34.907
You see, to the casual eye,
it's as good as invisible.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.744
Plus all the usual refinements,
ejector seat, torpedoes,

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:43.040
target-seeking shotguns
to shoot down mobile objects.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.083
Why don't you acquaint yourself
with the manual?

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.419
Should be able to shoot through that
in a couple of hours.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.928
Just took a few seconds, Q.

01:06:57.388 --> 01:06:59.181
Wish I could make you vanish.

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:04.102
Come in.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.943
Before you leave on
your mission for Iceland,

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.404
tell me what you know of James Bond.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.534
He's a double-0,
and a wild one, as I discovered today.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.538
He'll light the fuse on
any explosive situation

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:26.792
and be a danger to himself and others.
Kill first, ask questions later.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:28.961
I think he's a blunt instrument
whose primary method

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.921
is to provoke and confront.

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.006
A man nobody can get close to.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.717
A womanizer.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.428
Well, you're going to be seeing
a lot more of him in Iceland.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:43.308
With great respect,
a man like him could blow my cover.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.063
Miss Frost,
you volunteered for this operation,

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.774
but in three months,
you've turned up next to nothing.

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:52.484
Graves seems to be clean.

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:54.570
Well, Bond thinks differently,

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:57.990
so I'm going to let him do
what you so ably described,

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.325
mix things up a little with Mr. Graves.

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:03.870
And with you there,
things won't be able to get out of hand.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:06.915
In your three years in cryptology,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.043
you've managed to keep
business and pleasure separate.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:15.507
You haven't fraternized with any of your
fellow agents, despite several advances.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.845
I think it would be foolish to get involved
with someone within the community.

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.680
Especially James Bond.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:02.970
- I'm Mr. Kil.
- Well, there's a name to die for.

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:35.462
324 miles an hour.
That's a new personal best, boss.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:38.256
Thruster two cut out again.
Get it fixed, will you?

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:41.801
Glad you could make it, Mr. Bond.
How did you like my run?

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:44.179
Looked like a man on the edge
of losing control.

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:47.265
It's only by being on the edge
that we know who we really are,

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.600
under the skin.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:54.022
Take your Donald Campbell,
1967, the Bluebird. Water speed record.

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:59.736
- Campbell died on his return run.
- Yeah, but he died chasing a dream.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:03.115
- Isn't that the way to go?
- I'd rather not go at all.

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.034
I see you don't chase dreams,
you live them.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:08.453
One of the virtues of never sleeping,
Mr. Bond.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.205
I have to live my dreams.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:13.333
Besides, plenty of time to sleep
when you're dead.

01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:17.045
Mr. Bond.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:20.424
- Miss Frost.
- I'll show you your room.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.885
A palace of ice.
You must feel right at home.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.680
This whole place was built
for tonight's demonstration.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.225
I'm told the human element necessitates
a precise balance of heat and cold.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:33.019
Built on a lake?
I hope Graves got things right.

01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:35.105
What's that little property
I noticed next door?

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:38.316
The diamond mine
and Gustav's living quarters.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.745
Thank you.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:57.127
This is you.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:01.673
Wonderful.
Would you like to show me more?

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:19.107
Vodka martini.
Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.072
Mojito?

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.076
James. Here for the penguins this time?
Or for the view again?

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:33.246
Right now, I'm only interested
in endangered species.

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.085
Well, does that include me?

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:43.465
- Depends on what you're up to this time.
- So I left you in an explosive situation.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:46.259
You're a big boy,
figured you could handle yourself.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.513
No wonder your relationships don't last.

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:52.098
I'm a girl that just doesn't like
to get tied down.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:52.617
- You're still feeling the side effects?
- The insomnia is permanent for me.

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:56.246
An hour in the dream machine
keeps me sane.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:59.708
- What happened to you?
- Bond.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:01.793
He knows nothing.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.880
I've been this close to him,
and he still didn't know who I really was.

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:11.344
- You saw my father after your exchange?
- Yes.

01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:18.226
- General Moon still mourns your death.
- My death.

01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:20.979
Mr. Bond.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:26.526
- And Miss...
- Swift. Space and Technology magazine.

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:31.323
Really? I take it Mr. Bond's been
explaining his big bang theory?

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:35.619
- Yeah, I think I got the thrust of it.
- I see.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:40.832
The demonstration's about
to begin in five minutes. Shall we?

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:43.918
Shall we?

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:51.885
- Not Jinx anymore?
- I'll always be a jinx to you.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:05.774
As you know, I'm always trying to give
the planet something in return

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.108
for what it has given me.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:10.945
Those little shards of heaven
known as diamonds.

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:14.074
Now, diamonds arenât just
expensive stones.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:16.284
They are the stuff of dreams.

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:19.204
And the means to make dreams real.

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:44.062
Imagine being able to bring light and
warmth to the darkest parts of the world.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:48.024
Imagine being able to grow crops
the year round, bringing an end to hunger.

01:14:48.109 --> 01:14:53.988
Imagine a second sun,
shining like a diamond in the sky.

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:58.868
Let there be light.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:08.461
I give you Icarus!

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.595
Icarus is unique.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.515
Its miraculous silver skin
will inhale the sun's light

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:23.435
and breathe it gently
upon the Earth's surface.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:26.187
You have no idea how much Icarus
is about to change your world.

01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:44.706
And now, let us brighten this night
with our inner radiance.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.147
That's a wrap.

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:24.430
- Vlad, show me the modifications.
- Yeah.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:28.643
Here is the self-defense mechanism
you asked me to build in.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:31.396
-50,000 volts?
- A hundred.

01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:35.483
Armed

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.654
- and very dangerous.
- Very.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:36.878
Mmm.

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:38.922
M warned me this would happen.

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:42.592
That's why you tried so hard
not to be interested in me.

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:44.928
God, you're even worse
than your file says.

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:49.933
They don't look too convinced.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.393
Come on, put your back into it.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.610
Remember, I know all about you, 007.

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:03.446
Sex for dinner, death for breakfast.
Well, it's not gonna work with me.

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:05.365
- No?
- No.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:18.044
- You're getting good at this.
- Stop it. Are we still being watched?

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.130
- They left ages ago.
- God, you're impossible.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.341
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:56.165
You'd better stay here tonight.
Keep up the charade of being lovers.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:57.375
All right.

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.961
I must say, I admire your restraint.

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:02.797
You were here a full two hours
before anything blew up.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.759
The way you're going,
you'll get us both killed.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:13.474
James, tell me what really happened
in North Korea.

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:17.186
I was betrayed. That was all.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.860
Occupational hazard.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:35.913
- This is crazy. You're a double-0.
- It's only a number.

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:15.620
James,

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.040
be careful.

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:26.464
Go back to your room.
I'll come back for you.

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:00.248
Why do you want to kill me?

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.501
I thought it was the humane thing to do.

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:10.925
Who sent you?

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.181
Your mama, and she told me to tell you
she's really disappointed in you.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.394
I'll let you in on a little secret.

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:28.985
This mine is fake, but the lasers are real.

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.008
She won't talk.

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:56.929
- Let's make it permanent.
- I'll use the laser.

01:22:57.681 --> 01:22:59.098
Don't leave a mess.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:19.387
- Jinx?
- James! James! No, no!

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:21.764
Turn it off! Off! Off!

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:51.335
James, I could use a little help here.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:02.805
Switch it off,
or I'm gonna be half the girl I used to be.

01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:47.350
So, the girl who hates to be tied down?

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:49.560
Are you gonna get me off this thing?

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:52.271
- What are you, CIA?
- NSA.

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:56.233
- Hello, we're on the same side.
- Doesn't mean we're after the same thing.

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:57.401
Sure it does.

01:25:57.486 --> 01:26:01.739
World peace, unconditional love, and
our little friend with the expensive acne.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:05.701
- Zao?
- Yeah, Zao.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:08.913
He's back there with some weird,
psychedelic light mask.

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:11.665
Probably brought it
from the clinic in Cuba.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:14.752
He couldn't have brought it.

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:17.254
It was already here.

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:24.970
It belongs to another Korean, his boss.

01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:31.394
I think we need Kil to give us a hand
to get out of here.

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:33.270
I got a better idea.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.991
- I'm going to get backup.
- Wait.

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:49.537
Go to Miranda first. She's Ml6.
Warn her to get out.

01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:52.790
- And what are you gonna do?
- Unfinished business.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:09.473
So you live to die another day,

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.684
Colonel.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:17.940
At last. I was beginning to think
you'd never guess.

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:19.358
Was it painful?

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:23.320
- The gene therapy.
- You couldn't possibly imagine.

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:26.449
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:28.659
But there have been compensations.

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:31.996
Like watching you flail around
in your ignorance.

01:27:32.622 --> 01:27:35.541
Granting you life, day by day,
just to see if you'd get wise.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:36.667
It's been fun.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.421
Well, the fun is about
to come to a dead end.

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:46.719
We only met briefly, you and I,
but you left a lasting impression.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.097
You see,
when your intervention forced me

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:51.807
to present the world with a new face,

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:55.478
I chose to model
the disgusting Gustav Graves on you.

01:27:57.564 --> 01:27:58.939
Just in the details.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:04.069
That unjustifiable swagger.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:09.241
Your crass quips, a defense mechanism
concealing such inadequacy.

01:28:09.326 --> 01:28:11.368
My defense mechanism is right here.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:20.586
So, Miss Frost is not all she seems.

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:22.379
Looks can be deceptive.

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:27.051
Yes.

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:31.555
By the way, did you find out
who betrayed you in North Korea?

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.057
Only a matter of time.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:36.435
You never thought of looking
inside your own organization?

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:43.692
She was right under your nose.

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:51.200
It was so good of you
to bring your gun to bed with us.

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:54.453
Yes. Occupational hazard.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:00.376
You see, I have a gift.

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:03.462
An instinct for sensing
people's weaknesses.

01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:07.007
Yours is women. Hers and mine
is winning, whatever the cost.

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:11.679
So when I arranged for that fatal overdose
for the true victor at Sydney,

01:29:11.763 --> 01:29:15.182
I won myself my very own Ml6 agent,

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.644
using everything at my disposal,

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:23.565
her brains, her talent, even her sex.

01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:26.402
The coldest weapon of all.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:30.823
Hello.

01:29:32.284 --> 01:29:33.534
Miranda?

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:42.751
There will be others after me,
you know that.

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:45.546
You mean your American friend, Jinx.

01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:50.884
Soon to be the victim of a tragedy.

01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:54.263
An ice palace can be
such a treacherous place.

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:56.056
Hand over the toys.

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.058
Oh, yeah.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.649
You know, I've missed
your sparkling personality.

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:08.652
How's that for a punch line?

01:30:09.029 --> 01:30:10.321
Kill him.

01:30:11.614 --> 01:30:14.533
I enjoyed last night, James,
but it really is death for breakfast.

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:09.129
Kill him. Now!

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:20.224
- He got away.
- No matter.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:23.560
The pleasure of the kill is in the chase.

01:31:24.354 --> 01:31:25.562
Bring me the generals.

01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:40.494
Gentlemen,
I promised you a demonstration.

01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.373
Now you will see the true power of Icarus.

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:55.801
The Western spy runs, but he cannot hide.

01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:10.691
Icarus will lock on to the heat signature
and concentrate the sun's power.

01:32:29.794 --> 01:32:32.296
Hey, boss, he beat your time.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.489
Time to draw the line.

01:34:11.396 --> 01:34:13.897
Global warming is a terrible thing.

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:16.460
Yeah, nice moves, just like Bond.

01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:19.338
He was pretty vigorous last night, as well.

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:21.923
He did you?

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:25.302
- I didn't know he was that desperate.
- Well, he's not coming back for you.

01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:28.138
He just died running,
trying to save his own skin.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.848
Yeah.

01:35:30.642 --> 01:35:32.225
That's pretty good tailoring.

01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:35.187
I hope it doesn't shrink when it gets wet.

01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:22.317
We've got one hour to wrap this up.
Let's move.

01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:24.963
Come on, Jinx, where are you?

01:37:34.056 --> 01:37:35.140
All units, report. Now!

01:37:58.247 --> 01:38:00.582
Warning, adaptive camouflage failure.

01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:56.031
Time to give the American her bath.

01:42:14.045 --> 01:42:16.546
Adaptive camouflage restored.

01:43:04.804 --> 01:43:08.389
Vlad, does the word "ergonomics"
mean anything to you?

01:43:08.474 --> 01:43:09.933
Man? Machine?

01:43:11.102 --> 01:43:14.604
This is still a suitcase.

01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:16.564
Finish it, will you?

01:44:23.174 --> 01:44:24.507
Keep going.

01:44:25.009 --> 01:44:27.760
Come on, it's warm in here. Come on.

01:44:27.845 --> 01:44:31.431
The cold kept you alive, huh?
It must've kept you alive.

01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:33.141
Now, come on.

01:44:42.735 --> 01:44:44.194
What took you so long?

01:44:45.196 --> 01:44:46.196
I'm sorry.

01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:21.064
Agent Johnson.

01:45:25.694 --> 01:45:26.653
- James.
- Charles.

01:45:26.737 --> 01:45:28.112
Okay, bring us up to speed on this.

01:45:28.197 --> 01:45:31.074
Another large division has been mobilized
north of the DMZ.

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.992
That's 80,000 troops and counting.

01:45:33.077 --> 01:45:35.161
And another million in reserve.

01:45:35.245 --> 01:45:37.330
Moon's father won't let
this turn into a war.

01:45:37.539 --> 01:45:40.917
General Moon's under arrest.
The hard-liners staged a coup last night.

01:45:41.085 --> 01:45:44.128
The fact remains that you deliberately
misled me by implicating Bond.

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:46.839
If you'd told us about your agent
in the Cuban clinic...

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:48.341
She'd be dead already.

01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:51.177
- Your mole would've made sure of that.
- We wouldn't have had a mole at all

01:45:51.261 --> 01:45:53.596
if you'd disclosed the fact
that Miss Frost and Moon

01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:55.932
were on the Harvard
fencing team together.

01:45:56.934 --> 01:45:59.519
Knowing who to trust
is everything in this business.

01:46:00.437 --> 01:46:02.689
Well, well, James Bond.

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:06.067
- Just in time for the fireworks.
- Let's get down to business.

01:46:06.902 --> 01:46:08.444
We're at DEFCON 2.

01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:12.240
And if the North goes south,
they're gonna go south bigtime.

01:46:12.574 --> 01:46:15.576
You donât just stroll through
the world's biggest minefield.

01:46:15.911 --> 01:46:17.578
You need some kind of an edge.

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:21.207
- Icarus.
- We're taking care of that

01:46:21.291 --> 01:46:23.793
with an ASAT launch in one hour.

01:46:24.294 --> 01:46:27.672
- Where's Graves?
- In the middle of a North Korean air base.

01:46:27.756 --> 01:46:29.841
They're right where we can't touch them.

01:46:33.762 --> 01:46:35.138
You can't,

01:46:36.473 --> 01:46:38.558
- but I can.
- Look,

01:46:38.642 --> 01:46:42.645
we're here in case things escalate,
not to make sure that they do.

01:46:43.105 --> 01:46:46.315
No incursions into the North.
President gave me a direct order.

01:46:47.151 --> 01:46:48.985
And when did that ever stop you?

01:46:49.737 --> 01:46:52.488
Well, you make your own decision.
I'm sending in 007.

01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:55.992
You think I'd leave this
in the hands of the British?

01:46:58.662 --> 01:47:00.663
You go with him.

01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:03.291
Approaching drop zone.

01:47:08.505 --> 01:47:10.089
Okay, let's go!

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:24.937
- They've entered North Korean airspace.
- Relax, Robinson.

01:47:25.022 --> 01:47:29.525
If our radar can't see those Switchblades,
the North Koreans sure as hell can't.

01:47:51.548 --> 01:47:54.050
Hey, boss, they launched against Icarus.

01:47:55.511 --> 01:47:57.011
Leave it on automatic.

01:48:07.648 --> 01:48:12.401
I hope nobody here is superstitious.
That's one big mirror we're about to break.

01:48:21.578 --> 01:48:23.121
Oh, my God.

01:48:23.205 --> 01:48:27.083
Mobilize the South Korean troops.
And get me the President, now!

01:48:27.376 --> 01:48:28.709
Still no news of Bond?

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:44.225
Vehicles.

01:48:46.395 --> 01:48:47.937
Some big shots.

01:48:52.317 --> 01:48:53.359
It's him.

01:48:56.113 --> 01:48:59.240
-300 meters.
- Windage, one and a half.

01:49:06.999 --> 01:49:08.958
We gotta get on that plane.

01:49:49.499 --> 01:49:52.460
You, have my father brought down.

01:50:53.397 --> 01:50:54.730
I don't know you.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.859
You've always found it difficult
to accept me.

01:51:00.445 --> 01:51:05.700
That made my exile easier to bear,
but I never forgot what you taught me.

01:51:06.535 --> 01:51:09.996
In war, the victorious strategist
only seeks battle

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:14.333
- after the victory has been won.
- After the victory has been won.

01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:19.088
You see, Father,
I remember my Art of War,

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:22.675
and this is what guarantees that victory.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.095
My son,

01:52:10.307 --> 01:52:12.141
what have you done to yourself?

01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:14.810
Come, Father.

01:52:17.314 --> 01:52:19.148
Watch the rising of your son.

01:52:48.845 --> 01:52:51.430
The second that thing
hits the 38th parallel,

01:52:51.515 --> 01:52:53.599
we're going to hit them
with everything we got.

01:52:53.683 --> 01:52:55.142
That may not be enough.

01:53:11.034 --> 01:53:11.617
Do you see, Father?

01:53:11.701 --> 01:53:12.910
Icarus is clearing the minefield,
creating a highway for our troops.

01:53:19.042 --> 01:53:22.920
If the Americans don't run,
Icarus will destroy them.

01:53:47.279 --> 01:53:50.197
Japan is a bug waiting to be squashed,

01:53:51.116 --> 01:53:53.075
and the West will shake with fear.

01:53:58.415 --> 01:54:00.457
But the Americans will
send nuclear warheads.

01:54:00.542 --> 01:54:02.585
Icarus will swat them from the sky.

01:54:48.131 --> 01:54:49.882
You will destroy us.

01:54:56.473 --> 01:55:00.809
- You would kill your own son?
- The son I knew died long ago.

01:56:16.219 --> 01:56:17.845
Caution. Caution.

01:56:18.179 --> 01:56:19.763
- Manual.
- Up!

01:56:19.848 --> 01:56:21.056
Manual.

01:56:27.063 --> 01:56:28.772
- Up! Up!
- Caution. Caution.

01:56:29.065 --> 01:56:31.191
- Manual. Manual.
- Come on!

01:56:50.628 --> 01:56:52.004
Okay, guys.

01:56:53.089 --> 01:56:54.131
Okay.

01:56:58.053 --> 01:56:59.303
I got it.

01:57:00.055 --> 01:57:03.599
My, my. You get around.
Let's see your gun.

01:57:06.144 --> 01:57:07.269
Left hand.

01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:10.356
That's it.

01:57:11.733 --> 01:57:14.610
That's it. Now drop it.

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:19.281
Looks like your friends have bailed.

01:57:27.624 --> 01:57:28.999
Push on autopilot.

01:57:30.043 --> 01:57:31.293
Come on.

01:57:31.961 --> 01:57:34.046
That's it. Good girl.

01:57:54.984 --> 01:57:57.069
Well, drowning you didn't seem to work.

01:57:57.821 --> 01:57:59.988
I'll have to try something
more to the point.

01:58:03.952 --> 01:58:36.275
1, 000 meters and closing.

02:00:10.578 --> 02:00:13.330
I can read your every move.

02:00:17.126 --> 02:00:18.585
Read this.

02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:20.837
Bitch.

02:00:57.333 --> 02:01:00.669
Look, parachutes for the both of us.

02:01:04.007 --> 02:01:05.424
Not anymore.

02:01:11.347 --> 02:01:14.599
You see, Mr. Bond,
you can't kill my dreams.

02:01:18.021 --> 02:01:20.272
But my dreams can kill you.

02:01:21.774 --> 02:01:23.650
Time to face destiny.

02:01:40.376 --> 02:01:42.502
Time to face gravity.

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.836
I think I broke her heart.

02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:30.926
Looks like we're going down together.

02:02:32.762 --> 02:02:34.012
Not yet.

02:02:37.433 --> 02:02:39.851
- Get the back open.
- Okay.

02:02:57.286 --> 02:02:58.495
Come on!

02:04:07.356 --> 02:04:10.650
- Come on. Come on.
- I told you I was a jinx.

02:04:11.903 --> 02:04:15.989
I should have warned you.
My relationships don't last either.

02:04:21.954 --> 02:04:24.164
- At least we're gonna die rich.
- Huh?

02:04:28.336 --> 02:04:31.254
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.

02:04:31.506 --> 02:04:32.881
Come on.

02:04:53.194 --> 02:04:54.402
Now,

02:04:55.238 --> 02:04:58.406
you said something about
going down together?

02:05:38.656 --> 02:05:41.449
- James.
- Moneypenny.

02:06:26.954 --> 02:06:27.996
Oh, James.

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:41.176
Moneypenny?

02:06:43.054 --> 02:06:45.847
I was just testing it out.

02:06:48.726 --> 02:06:51.936
- It's rather hard, isn't it?
- Yes. Very.

02:07:28.891 --> 02:07:31.976
Wait, don't pull it out.
I'm not finished with it yet.

02:07:32.061 --> 02:07:34.854
See? It's a perfect fit.

02:07:35.439 --> 02:07:36.815
Uh-huh.

02:07:37.233 --> 02:07:40.485
Leave it in.
- Well, it's gotta come out sooner or later.

02:07:40.569 --> 02:07:44.072
No, leave it in, please. Few more minutes?

02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:49.369
We really have to get these back.

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:52.831
Still the good guys, huh?

02:07:57.837 --> 02:08:01.840
I'm still not quite sure how good you are.

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:08.012
I am so good.

02:08:09.682 --> 02:08:11.599
Especially when you're bad.

02:08:50.764 --> 02:08:54.267
I'm gonna wake up
Yes and no

02:08:54.351 --> 02:08:58.104
I'm gonna kiss
Some part of

02:08:58.314 --> 02:09:01.983
I'm gonna keep this secret

02:09:02.067 --> 02:09:05.653
I'm gonna close my body now

02:09:17.208 --> 02:09:21.002
I'm gonna break the cycle

02:09:21.128 --> 02:09:25.006
I'm gonna shake up the system

02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:28.885
I'm gonna destroy my ego

02:09:28.969 --> 02:09:32.388
I'm gonna close my body now

02:09:34.183 --> 02:09:37.018
My body now

02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:40.313
My body now

02:09:41.774 --> 02:09:44.400
My body now

02:09:45.528 --> 02:09:47.946
My body now

02:10:17.726 --> 02:10:21.229
I guess I'll die another day

02:10:21.689 --> 02:10:25.149
I guess I'll die another day

02:10:25.234 --> 02:10:28.736
I guess I'll die another day

02:10:28.988 --> 02:10:32.240
I guess I'll die another day

02:10:32.825 --> 02:10:35.577
I guess I'll die another day

02:10:36.412 --> 02:10:39.914
I guess I'll die another day

02:10:40.249 --> 02:10:43.251
I guess I'll die another day

02:10:43.919 --> 02:10:46.838
I guess I'll die another day

02:11:03.147 --> 02:11:06.858
I'm gonna avoid the clichÃ©

02:11:06.942 --> 02:11:10.528
I'm gonna suspend my senses

02:11:10.738 --> 02:11:14.407
I'm gonna delay my pleasure

02:11:14.533 --> 02:11:18.119
I'm gonna close my body now

02:11:20.164 --> 02:11:22.081
My body now

02:11:23.917 --> 02:11:25.835
My body now

02:11:27.713 --> 02:11:29.964
My body now

02:11:31.467 --> 02:11:33.468
My body now

02:11:50.819 --> 02:11:52.987
Another day

02:11:54.657 --> 02:11:56.866
Another day

02:11:58.327 --> 02:12:00.828
Another day

02:12:02.206 --> 02:12:03.915
Another day

02:12:21.975 --> 02:12:25.937
I need to lay down

02:12:26.305 --> 02:12:32.370
