16:08.501 --> 16:09.636
Oh, so I'm a monster.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.638
Frankenstein was
the doctor.
Okay.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.606
You clearly don't know that
book, and you clearly don't know

16:13.640 --> 16:15.075
how to deal with my kids!
Ben...

16:15.108 --> 16:19.446
I'm sorry, but you
overstepped this time.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.215
Wow.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.618
I can't believe
Ben got so upset.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.189
I make one little comment
about his parenting...
Mm-hmm.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.158
...he flies off the handle.
Uh-huh.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.692
He is coddling them.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.761
Mm-hmm, I see where
you're coming from.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.796
Okay, you're agreeing with me
in a way that clearly states

16:36.829 --> 16:38.431
you don't agree.
What's going on?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.400
You said the exact
same thing about him.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.369
True,
but he can't hear me.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.603
Whose team are you on?

16:43.636 --> 16:45.138
What, are you
his imaginary friend now?

16:45.172 --> 16:47.140
Ugh, I'm sorry.
We've never hurt his feelings

16:47.174 --> 16:49.276
like this before.
It's making me feel weird.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.578
Me, too.
But it's not fair.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.480
I am kind of right.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.448
Plus, I'm getting no credit
for fixing Dora.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.417
It's because of me she didn't
barge in with nightmares,

16:57.450 --> 16:59.719
as evidenced
by her video blog.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.721
There's a horrible
blonde succubus

17:01.754 --> 17:03.290
obsessed with Dad.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.491
What?

17:04.524 --> 17:05.692
I hate her so much.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.095
She even killed Bunny.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.231
That could mean anything.
[ Knock on door ]

17:11.264 --> 17:13.466
But she's definitely
talking about you.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.267
Ben: Hello?

17:14.301 --> 17:16.269
Hey.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.304
Hey.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.571
I'm sorry.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.207
I got overly defensive

17:20.240 --> 17:21.541
and went a little
"mama bear" on you.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.410
I'm sorry, too.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.678
What are you, nuts?
You don't have a reason to be.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.581
You were just trying to help,
and I overreacted.

17:28.615 --> 17:32.652
Look, bottom line is
you're right.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.754
I do coddle them.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.224
Maybe a little.
It's hard.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.193
After I got divorced,
I just felt so guilty.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.661
And it rocked their world,
you know?

17:41.694 --> 17:43.796
And I found myself doing

17:43.830 --> 17:45.698
every little thing I could
to make them feel

17:45.732 --> 17:47.367
just a little bit better.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.438
That's because
you're caring and sweet.

17:51.471 --> 17:55.108
But it's been two years.
Your kids are doing great.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.809
It's okay to back off
a little.

17:56.843 --> 18:00.147
Here's the thing.
I don't want to let go.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.382
I just love their
stupid faces so much.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.318
And when their whiny
little voices call my name,

18:05.352 --> 18:08.388
it melts my heart.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.422
It's magic.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.325
Wow.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.627
Look, I know that
all means a lot,

18:14.661 --> 18:17.230
but maybe it's time
to start taking

18:17.264 --> 18:19.666
baby steps forward,
for everyone's sake.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.601
You're right.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.436
And who better to help me
than the woman

18:23.470 --> 18:25.338
who solved Dora's problems?

18:25.372 --> 18:26.839
Mm-hmm.
Sell it.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.475
Mm-hmm!

18:28.508 --> 18:29.609
Is there more
to this story?

18:29.642 --> 18:31.644
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to tell me?

18:31.678 --> 18:32.812
Mnh-mnh.
Okay.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.381
[ Chuckles ]

18:34.414 --> 18:35.848
I hate her so much.

18:35.882 --> 18:36.816
You think this is about you?

18:36.849 --> 18:39.219
Uh, yes.
Okay, first of all,

18:39.252 --> 18:40.520
I don't dream about you.
Gross.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.522
Second of all,

18:42.555 --> 18:44.624
I had this dream when I watched
the movie "Fatal Attraction."

18:44.657 --> 18:45.792
But "blonde succubus"?

18:45.825 --> 18:47.327
Glenn Close.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.396
Oh! "Bunny."

18:49.429 --> 18:51.598
It wasn't our Bunny.
She boils an actual pet bunny!

18:51.631 --> 18:52.699
Such a good part.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.201
Ah, thank God.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.269
I mean, it's horrible,
but yay.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.637
Ah, all right, now
that that's settled,

18:57.670 --> 18:58.771
I'm taking your phone.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.906
-Huh?
-It's time for me

18:59.939 --> 19:01.508
to put my foot down
gently and slightly.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.442
You may not
even notice it.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.411
Okay.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.778
No more scary movies
before bed.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.813
And if you ignore that
and get nightmares,

19:06.846 --> 19:07.914
you're on your own.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.218
This is your fault.
What?

19:11.251 --> 19:13.553
I take it back.
You a Glenn Close.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.921
You are the succubus.
-Hey.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.623
This isn't Alice's decision.
It's mine.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.459
That just makes me mad
at both of you!

19:19.492 --> 19:20.793
Love you, too.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.662
That's not what I said.
But it's what I heard.

Night, munchkin.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.800
Watch this.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.470
Ba-da-bam! I'm a pro.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.739
Okay, you're gonna start using
your sleep-apnea machine.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.674
No, I look like
such a dork.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.577
You can either sleep with
the mask or sleep outside.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.579
Fine, I choose the mask.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.848
At least I'll look like
the guy from "Mad Max."
