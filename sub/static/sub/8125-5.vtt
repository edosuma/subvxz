From television city

00:04.904 --> 00:08.006
¶ Boy, the way
Glenn Miller played ¶

00:08.074 --> 00:11.710
¶ songs that made
the hit parade ¶

00:11.777 --> 00:15.580
¶ guys like us
we had it made ¶

00:15.648 --> 00:18.783
[ together ]
¶ those were the days ¶

00:20.019 --> 00:24.089
¶ and you knew
where you were then ¶

00:24.156 --> 00:27.325
[ Archie ]
¶ girls were girls
and men were men ¶

00:27.392 --> 00:30.128
[ Archie, Edith ]
¶ mister, we could use a man ¶

00:30.195 --> 00:34.465

01:02.128 --> 01:05.163
Michael, could you
please help me ?
The can opener's stuck.

01:05.230 --> 01:09.500
Sure, babe. That's enough
landmarks of economic thought
for one afternoon.

01:09.568 --> 01:13.104
And could you help me
set the table too ? Roger
will be here in a few minutes.

01:13.172 --> 01:15.106
Sure.
What's for lunch ?

01:15.174 --> 01:17.508
You'll see,
and no grabbing
any samples.

01:17.576 --> 01:20.011
There's only one thing
I wanna grab.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.180
Michael !
[ Giggling ]

01:24.216 --> 01:26.718
I just don't think
it's right, Archie.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.487
Every time the church
has a charity drive,

01:29.555 --> 01:33.491
I gotta say, "my husband
don't have any old clothes."
So ?

01:33.559 --> 01:37.195
So, I've been tellin' them
that for 15 years.

01:37.262 --> 01:39.664
Listen, that's the trouble
with this country today.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.100
There's too many handouts.

01:42.168 --> 01:45.837
Every guy and his brother's
on welfare, which is the same
as pickin' my pocket.

01:45.905 --> 01:49.708
Well, if they're gonna
pick my pocket, they ain't
gonna do it in my suit.

01:51.443 --> 01:54.746
I didn't hear the substance,
but the tone tells me
to set this down easy,

01:54.814 --> 01:57.415
mind my own business
and steal slowly
out of the room.

01:57.482 --> 01:59.483
Hey.
Didn't make it.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.354
Two seconds away from freedom.

02:03.422 --> 02:05.924
If it's freedom from me
you're inferrin' there,

02:05.991 --> 02:08.491
you'll notice I ain't got
no bars on that front door.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.729
Archie, I'm makin' a joke.
Can't you take a joke ?

02:10.795 --> 02:13.898
I can take--
I know. You can take
a joke with the best of them.

02:13.966 --> 02:17.435
If you're gonna answer your
questions as well as ask them,
what do you need us for ?

02:17.502 --> 02:19.503
You're a regular
one-man family.

02:19.571 --> 02:22.540
All right, you two.
That's enough of that.
Michael, I need you.

02:22.608 --> 02:24.943
Now, hold it, hold it.
Come here a minute.
Come here.

02:25.010 --> 02:29.247
What is this here ?
"S.S. Pierce
fancy cashews" ?

02:29.314 --> 02:32.483
What, are we gettin'
too classy for peanuts ?
Edith !

02:32.551 --> 02:35.754
I got no problem with peanuts.

02:35.821 --> 02:38.623
Daddy, will you
please stop it.

02:38.690 --> 02:41.726
Those are for company,
and besides, they only
cost a few cents more.

02:41.794 --> 02:45.296
"Cost a few cents more."
Edith, did you bring
these things into the house ?

02:45.364 --> 02:47.465
Probably.
What do you mean,
"probably" ?

02:47.532 --> 02:49.834
I mean probably I did.

02:49.902 --> 02:52.670
Well, probably you did
could also mean
probably you didn't.

02:52.738 --> 02:56.274
That's the way it is
with a word like "probably."
Right ?

02:56.341 --> 02:59.043
Probably.
Dingbat !

02:59.111 --> 03:02.713
What is all this, anyway ?
Whattaya got here ?
Is that whipped cream ?

03:02.782 --> 03:06.184
It's clam dip.
Clam dip ?

03:06.252 --> 03:08.920
What's this ? What kind
of fish is that ?
Smoked salmon.

03:08.988 --> 03:12.290
Smoked salmon ?
I only get tuna fish
for my lunch.

03:12.357 --> 03:14.893
Who you havin' here ?
The Duke of windsor ?
What difference would it make ?

03:14.960 --> 03:17.962
Whoever it is, you're not
gonna like him. You don't
like anything about us.

03:18.030 --> 03:21.833
You resent our attitudes,
our politics,
even the clothes we wear.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.302
I don't think there's
one thing about us
you agree with.

03:24.369 --> 03:26.370
I agree with that.

03:28.240 --> 03:32.476
That don't answer the question.
Who's the big cheese
you're havin' here for lunch ?

03:32.544 --> 03:35.814
Roger.
Roger, the fairy ?

03:35.881 --> 03:37.949
All right, all right.
Let's not start--

03:38.017 --> 03:41.552
did you hear that, Edith ?
You know who they're bringing
around here for lunch ?

03:41.620 --> 03:43.888
Roger.
Sweetie pie Roger !

03:43.956 --> 03:45.890
Would you
cut it out, huh ?

03:45.958 --> 03:48.159
He's their friend,
Archie.
Listen, Edith.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.328
We run
a decent home here,

03:50.395 --> 03:55.466
and we don't need
any strange little birdies
flyin' in and out of it.

03:55.534 --> 03:59.170
Daddy, you stop that.
Roger's not
a strange little birdie.

03:59.238 --> 04:03.708
His pal Roger is as queer
as a four-dollar bill,
and he knows it.

04:03.775 --> 04:07.045
That's not only cruel, daddy,
that's an outright lie.

04:07.112 --> 04:09.647
You know something, Archie,
just because a guy
is sensitive...

04:09.715 --> 04:13.451
And he's an intellectual
and he wears glasses,
you make him out a queer.

04:13.518 --> 04:16.420
I never said a guy
who wears glasses is a queer.

04:16.488 --> 04:20.524
A guy who wears glasses
is a four eyes. A guy
who is a fag is a queer.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.796
Mom, make him
stop talking like that.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.899
Oh, dear,
I-I-I don't know.
Mom--

04:27.967 --> 04:30.168
go ahead, Edith.
Now, answer the girl.

04:30.236 --> 04:33.704
Now, you've seen Roger
sashaying around here
with his la-di-da talk.

04:33.772 --> 04:36.007
He's a pansy.
I don't know.

04:36.075 --> 04:41.179
What do you mean,
you don't know ?
I'm not an expert on flowers.

04:41.247 --> 04:45.549
Archie, look.
You might as well face it.
You're all alone in this.

04:45.617 --> 04:47.818
We all know Roger,
and we all know he's straight.

04:47.887 --> 04:51.489
And even if he wasn't--
and I said <i>if--</i> what
difference would that make ?

04:51.556 --> 04:54.926
In many countries--
england, for instance--
there is a law...

04:54.994 --> 04:58.263
That says whatever two
consenting adults do in private
is their own business.

04:58.330 --> 05:00.531
Listen.
This ain't england.

05:00.599 --> 05:03.701
We threw england
out of here a long time ago.

05:03.769 --> 05:06.704
We don't want
no more part of england,
and for your information,

05:06.772 --> 05:09.007
england
is a fag country.

05:10.442 --> 05:12.243
What ?
<i>Certainly.</i>

05:12.311 --> 05:15.780
Ain't they still
pickin' handkerchiefs
out of their sleeve, huh ?

05:16.848 --> 05:18.783
Ain't they still
standin' around,

05:18.850 --> 05:21.519
leanin' on them
skinny umbrellas
like this here ?

05:21.586 --> 05:26.657
I know this.
Their whole society is based
on a kind of a "fagdom."

05:26.725 --> 05:29.360
Di-- yo-- yo--

05:29.428 --> 05:31.996
you know,
you're right, Archie.
You're right.

05:32.064 --> 05:34.165
The British are
a bunch of pansies.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.267
Pansies, fairies
and sissies.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.269
And the Japanese
are a race of midgets,

05:38.337 --> 05:40.671
the Irish are boozers,
the Mexicans are bandits--

05:40.739 --> 05:43.674
and you polacks
are meatheads.

05:44.743 --> 05:46.744
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>

05:46.812 --> 05:50.415
That's Roger.
Now, daddy,
please be good.

05:50.482 --> 05:52.883
If I can't be good,
I'll be careful.

05:55.187 --> 05:57.288
Gloria !
Hey, Mike, hi.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.824
Nice to see you.
How was the trip ?
Nice to see you.

05:59.891 --> 06:02.026
Fabulous ! Mike, it was
the most super trip.

06:02.094 --> 06:04.095
In fact, it was
an absolutely stunning,

06:04.163 --> 06:06.497
exhausting,
incredible experience !

06:06.565 --> 06:09.434
Oh, when is he gonna land ?

06:09.501 --> 06:12.036
Um, pardon me, Roger.
You know my mother.

06:12.104 --> 06:15.139
Oh, yes. Mrs. bunker.
So nice to see you again.
How do you do, Roger ?

06:15.207 --> 06:17.208
Really a pleasure.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.681
And my father,
Mr. bunker.
Mr. bunker.

06:23.748 --> 06:27.485
Yeah, how are ya ?
Uh, one hand's enough.

06:27.552 --> 06:31.522
Roger, why don't you sit down,
make yourself comfortable,
and I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.592
Oh, mom, Roger
brought us some snapshots
from his trip to Europe.

06:34.659 --> 06:37.161
Oh, I like snapshots.

06:37.229 --> 06:41.332
I always like
to think about everybody
standin' there in them.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.368
You know, frozen-like ?

06:43.435 --> 06:46.471
And then the next minute,
after the picture
has been snapped,

06:46.538 --> 06:48.572
they're all off
and movin' again.

06:53.879 --> 06:56.347
I like to think about
who they are...

06:58.283 --> 07:01.119
<i>And where</i>
<i>they're going,</i>

07:01.186 --> 07:03.054
right after the picture
is snapped.

07:05.790 --> 07:09.494
You're a pip, you know that,
Edith ? You're a regular
edna St. Louis millay.

07:11.796 --> 07:13.731
Here are
the hors d'oeuvres.
Oh.

07:13.798 --> 07:15.733
Well, tell us
about Europe there,
Roger.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.103
What kind of sports action
they got over there
this time of the year ?

07:19.171 --> 07:21.839
I mean, they must have
things like skiin' there,
and bobsleddin'.

07:21.907 --> 07:24.842
Bobsleddin'.
There's a manly sport.

07:24.910 --> 07:27.011
Do you do any bobsleddin'
over there ?

07:27.079 --> 07:30.581
Uh, well, no, sir.
There isn't too much of that
in London, I'm afraid.

07:30.649 --> 07:32.616
That's where I spent
most of my time.

07:32.684 --> 07:35.819
- Oh, London, huh ?
London, england, huh ?
- Yes.

07:35.887 --> 07:37.821
Your witness.

07:37.889 --> 07:41.792
Let's take a look
at those pictures.
Let me see what you got.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.794
Wow.
Oh, wouldn't you know it.

07:43.862 --> 07:45.829
The first one's
the cornball of all time.

07:45.897 --> 07:48.332
The changing of the guard
at Buckingham Palace.
Oh, my !

07:48.400 --> 07:52.070
- Look at those big hats.
- <i>These are the gardens</i>
<i> </i> <i>at coventry.</i>

07:52.137 --> 07:54.072
Oh, what beautiful
flowers !

07:54.139 --> 07:57.508
Aren't the colors vibrant ?
And you know,
they smelled heavenly.

07:59.478 --> 08:01.579
He's off the ground again.

08:01.646 --> 08:04.348
<i>Here's the old standby.</i>
<i>Big Ben.</i>

08:04.416 --> 08:07.785
Oh, my, you can
almost hear it chime.

08:07.852 --> 08:10.421
Look, it's 4:00.

08:10.489 --> 08:14.492
And one minute later,
after the picture
was snapped,

08:14.560 --> 08:16.760
the hands
were moving again,

08:16.828 --> 08:20.465
and it was
one minute after 4:00.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.770
Uh-- oh ! Oh.

08:26.838 --> 08:29.373
This was a most
enchanting young person.

08:29.441 --> 08:32.110
Boy or girl ?
<i>A boy.</i>

08:32.177 --> 08:34.278
Why did I ask ?

08:34.346 --> 08:37.315
<i>He was selling</i>
<i>peace stickers there</i>
<i>in piccadilly circus.</i>

08:37.381 --> 08:39.350
Look at that expression !

08:39.418 --> 08:43.053
And right after
you snapped the picture,
he was moving again.

08:43.121 --> 08:46.690
And everybody behind him.
Yeah, they was
all movin', Edith !

08:46.758 --> 08:48.959
I want to take a look
at this enchantin' young person.

08:49.027 --> 08:52.263
Aren't you gonna be late
meeting Steve and the guys
at the tavern ?

08:52.331 --> 08:54.265
Oh, I thought
I'd hang around
and hear about...

08:54.333 --> 08:57.001
Some more of
the enchanting things
he done over there.

08:57.068 --> 08:59.237
For instance,
uh, did he hunt ?

09:00.705 --> 09:03.174
You know Roger
doesn't hunt. I don't
believe in it either.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.577
Sometimes I got my doubts
about you too, Buster brown.

09:06.645 --> 09:09.347
All right, Edith,
I'm going over
to kelcy's bar,

09:09.414 --> 09:13.017
say hello to my friend,
Steve, and say hello
to some of the boys.

09:13.084 --> 09:16.020
Nice seein' you too,
Roger.
Oh, my pleasure, Mr. bunker.

09:16.087 --> 09:18.389
Whoopee.

09:18.457 --> 09:22.326
Archie, maybe you
can bring back a pitcher
of kelcy's tap.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.395
It'd go good
with their lunch.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.764
Yeah, ma, Roger
and I'll pick it up later.

09:26.831 --> 09:30.067
Uh, Archie, never mind.
Why don't you go and
have a nice afternoon.

09:30.135 --> 09:33.471
Yeah, yeah, I know,
I know. It's been
a charmin' interlude.

09:35.407 --> 09:38.075
Here. I made us some
little hot toddies.

09:38.143 --> 09:40.978
And, oh, Roger,
have some fancy cashews.

09:41.046 --> 09:43.214
Oh, thank you.
They're from
s.S. Pierce.

09:43.282 --> 09:46.217
S.S. Pierce !
That's my favorite
kind of cashew.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.786
Listen, guys, all I'm sayin'
is the right to strike...

09:48.853 --> 09:51.389
Is in the constitution and in
the declaration of independence.

09:51.456 --> 09:54.858
And all I'm saying, Barney,
there's a time and a place
for everything.

09:54.926 --> 09:58.462
Wages go up, prices go up.
Right away, inflation.

09:58.530 --> 10:01.065
Yeah, Steve is right.
It's what you call
your upward "spinal."

10:01.132 --> 10:03.301
[ Laughing ]
The point
still is,

10:03.368 --> 10:06.737
you can't tell an American
when he can go on strike
if he wants to.

10:06.805 --> 10:08.739
America means
it's up to him.

10:08.807 --> 10:12.476
America means it's
his God-given right, and
anything else is un-American.

10:12.544 --> 10:15.246
Yeah, but your American workers
goin' on strike...

10:15.314 --> 10:18.249
Is what makes
your kids' shoes
cost so much.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.351
Not my kids' shoes.
Why not ?

10:20.419 --> 10:22.853
'Cause we buy jap shoes.

10:22.921 --> 10:25.856
He's got you there, Archie.
Yeah, at
the discount house.

10:25.924 --> 10:27.558
Hey, speakin'
about imports,

10:27.626 --> 10:31.329
you guys gotta go see
that Swedish picture
that just opened downtown.

10:31.396 --> 10:34.532
[ Steve ] Oh, yeah ?
<i>Wanda: How I</i>
<i>became a woman.</i>

10:34.600 --> 10:37.468

10:37.536 --> 10:40.571
Really somethin', huh ?
Oh, this Wanda's
got a built on her.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.707
Yeah ? Yeah ?
She's a waitress, see ?

10:42.774 --> 10:46.043
And the first time
you see her, she's leanin'
over the counter.

10:46.111 --> 10:48.879
And I mean <i>leanin'.</i>
<i>[ Chuckling ]</i>

10:48.947 --> 10:51.249
She can really act.

10:54.686 --> 10:58.589
Yeah, but you gotta admit,
some of them foreign films,
they go too far, you know.

10:58.657 --> 11:02.760
I mean, some of them,
they ain't nothin'
but sheer "pornograbby."

11:02.827 --> 11:04.862
Yeah, yeah,
I know what you mean.

11:04.929 --> 11:06.930
But this <i>Wanda</i> thing
has got what they call...

11:06.998 --> 11:09.300
Some redeemin' "socialness."

11:09.368 --> 11:11.302
Oh, yeah,
I heard of that.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.304
That's where they give you
the same "pornograb,"

11:13.372 --> 11:16.674
but they advertise
in the <i>times</i>
<i>instead of the</i> <i>news.</i>

11:16.742 --> 11:19.443
[ Chuckling ]
Hey, kelcy. Put a head
on this, will ya ?

11:19.511 --> 11:22.146
Anyway, you gotta go
see this <i>Wanda.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go see it.</i>

11:22.213 --> 11:25.015
You don't have to
go to movies to see
your wandas, huh, Steve ?

11:25.083 --> 11:28.552
I mean, you bachelors,
you got 'em comin' and goin'
like runnin' water, huh ?

11:28.620 --> 11:30.921
Whatever you say, arch.
Come over
and sit down with me.

11:30.989 --> 11:32.990
I want to ask you
some things.
Sure.

11:33.057 --> 11:36.226
When you was playin' pro ball,
I mean, the game
was different then.

11:36.295 --> 11:39.263
It was rougher,
it was tougher. It was
real guts football, huh ?

11:39.331 --> 11:41.865
None of your two platoon
stuff and all that, huh ?

11:41.933 --> 11:44.201
Oh, I don't know, arch.
It was a long time ago.

11:44.269 --> 11:47.538
Yeah, but when you was playin'
against bronko nagurski--
no, no, no, no, no.

11:47.606 --> 11:49.540
We never played
the bears.

11:49.608 --> 11:52.242
Besides, I only
played two seasons.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.479
Listen to this guy.
You only played two seasons.

11:55.547 --> 11:59.283
You know how many people
never even played
one season ? Most.

11:59.351 --> 12:02.286
What I mean is,
how do you keep yourself
in such great shape ?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.288
Look at your shoulders
and all that.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.057
Well, I work out every day,
jog two Miles every morning,

12:07.125 --> 12:09.059
and, uh, archery.

12:09.127 --> 12:12.697
Archery ?
Yeah, it's good for
the arms and the shoulders.

12:12.764 --> 12:15.599
You mean with
a bow and arrow ?
Yeah.

12:15.667 --> 12:18.836
Jeez, you know,
I never figured you
for no bow and arrow.

12:18.903 --> 12:21.672
Hey, kelcy, let me have
a pitcherful there, will ya.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.841
Hey, Mike.
Hey, you guys.
How ya doin' ?

12:23.908 --> 12:27.177
Get a load of this.
My son-in-law and
his pal tinkerbell.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.914
Excuse me,
will you, Mike.
Hey, Steve !

12:30.982 --> 12:33.016
Hey, rog.
Hi, Mr. bunker.

12:33.084 --> 12:35.152
Good to see you
again, kid.
Here, sit down.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.287
<i>Thank you,</i>
<i>but we're only</i>
<i>gonna be a minute.</i>

12:37.356 --> 12:41.091
I just got back from Europe,
and I wanted you to know
I got some beautiful shots.

12:41.159 --> 12:43.627
<i>[ Steve ] Good. How did</i>
<i>the zoom lens work out ?</i>
<i>Fantastic.</i>

12:43.695 --> 12:46.697
<i>The best lens</i>
<i>you ever sold me.</i>
<i>Next time you're in the shop,</i>

12:46.765 --> 12:48.699
there's a 105 that's
great for portraits.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.201
I'll come Thursday
and look at it.
Good to see you.

12:51.269 --> 12:53.471
Nice to see you.
Arch, I'll flip you
for the beers.

12:53.538 --> 12:56.374
Oh, no, not today, Steve.
Your money ain't no good
around here.

12:56.441 --> 12:59.910
Uh, Mike, uh,
could I speak
with you for--

12:59.978 --> 13:03.080
would, uh, you
excuse us, please, huh ?
Oh, sure. Sure.

13:03.147 --> 13:05.583
Thanks.

13:05.650 --> 13:07.785
Hey.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.454
This, uh, kid
you come in with.

13:10.522 --> 13:12.857
Is he straight ?
Oh, no.

13:12.924 --> 13:15.359
Not you too.
Of course he is. Why ?

13:15.427 --> 13:18.095
Well, the way him
and Steve there
were so buddy-buddy,

13:18.162 --> 13:20.163
I thought maybe
he was a little, uh--

13:21.600 --> 13:23.667
you know ?
What ?

13:23.735 --> 13:26.737
Well, now,
don't get me wrong.
I don't mind Steve.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.939
His camera store
is just down the street here.

13:29.007 --> 13:32.476
He only comes in
for a drink once in a while
on his way home.

13:32.544 --> 13:36.113
Besides, he don't, uh,
camp it up, you know ?

13:37.549 --> 13:40.651
And he don't bring in
none of his friends.

13:42.521 --> 13:45.890
Kelcy, are you trying
to tell me that Steve is--

13:45.957 --> 13:49.159
I just wouldn't
want my place...

13:49.227 --> 13:52.830
To become
no, uh, hangout.

13:54.299 --> 13:56.467
Know what I mean ?
Huh ?

14:12.383 --> 14:15.820
Gloria, this was
a delicious lunch.
Oh, thank you, Roger.

14:15.887 --> 14:19.490
It was sweet of you
to come over today
and share your trip with us.

14:19.558 --> 14:23.226
Don't be silly.
I loved it. It was like
reliving the whole experience.

14:23.294 --> 14:28.298
The picture I like the best
was the one of the queen
passing by.

14:28.366 --> 14:32.603
Oh, mom. That was
just her carriage.
You couldn't even see her.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.138
I know, but she was inside,

14:35.206 --> 14:38.075
sittin' there royal-like.

14:38.142 --> 14:41.278
Maybe takin' a speck
out of her eye.

14:44.649 --> 14:47.985
Hey, you know what
they got on at 3:00,
channel 9 ?

14:48.052 --> 14:51.421
They got a special on there.
Great fights of the century.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.358
Jack dempsey, Joe Louis,
rocky marciano-- all of 'em.

14:54.425 --> 14:56.426
Bring us over a beer here,
will ya, Edith.

14:56.495 --> 14:59.096
Oh, you're still here,
are you, Roger ?

14:59.163 --> 15:01.098
Uh, he was just
leaving, daddy.

15:01.165 --> 15:06.069
Uh, yes. However, I'm happy
that I had the opportunity to
say good-bye to you again, sir.

15:06.137 --> 15:09.139
Oh, well, if it means
that much to you, swell.

15:09.207 --> 15:12.142
Unless of course you want
to sit here and watch
the fights with me.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.979
Well, no, thank you, sir.
I don't care much
for pugilism.

15:15.046 --> 15:18.816
Who's talkin' about pugilism ?
I asked you to watch the fights.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.151
Fighting is not
my cup of tea, sir.

15:21.219 --> 15:23.687
Oh, fighting's not
his cup of tea.
That's that then, huh ?

15:23.755 --> 15:25.689
Uh, yeah.
Come on, rog.
Let's go.

15:25.757 --> 15:28.959
Hey, Mike, uh, come here
a minute, will ya.
What ?

15:29.027 --> 15:31.361
Why don't you
just open up a window.

15:31.429 --> 15:33.430
We'll all watch him
fly out.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.535
Thanks again.
Bye.
Uh, see ya, rog.

15:37.602 --> 15:39.870
Hey, wanna watch
the fights, Mike ?
No, thanks.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.939
What's the matter,
you sorehead ?

15:42.007 --> 15:44.675
Just because I called
the turn on your friend
Roger-bell ?

15:44.743 --> 15:47.344
Listen, Archie,
you make one more crack
about Roger--

15:47.412 --> 15:49.847
or what ?
Well, never mind.

15:49.915 --> 15:52.716
But I could tell you
something that could
shock you pretty good.

15:52.784 --> 15:54.919
I been everywhere where
the grass grows green.

15:54.986 --> 15:58.288
Nothing you're gonna show me
or tell me is gonna shock me.
Remember that.

15:58.356 --> 16:01.224
I know something
that'd shock you, daddy.
I bet you can't do this thing.

16:01.292 --> 16:03.226
Oh, yeah, come on.
Just try for a second.

16:03.294 --> 16:05.295
Leave me alone.
I'm watchin'
the fights here.

16:05.363 --> 16:07.765
There's a commercial on here.
It'd just take a second.

16:07.832 --> 16:09.767
All right.
What do you got ?
Yeah.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.769
What is this ?
Some kind of
practical joke.

16:11.836 --> 16:14.738
No, no, no.
It's not a joke.
Gloria, show him.

16:14.806 --> 16:16.941
Watch, daddy.
Take three steps
back from the wall.

16:17.008 --> 16:18.943
Yeah.
One, two, three.

16:19.010 --> 16:21.011
Then you put the chair
in front of you.

16:21.079 --> 16:23.013
You bend over,
put your head
against the wall,

16:23.081 --> 16:25.315
and you pick up the chair,
and ta-da.

16:26.517 --> 16:28.552
That's it ?
That's it.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.154
That's all there is.
It's just that men can't do it.

16:31.222 --> 16:34.324
-Michael can't do it.
Show him, Michael.
-Yeah, watch this. Here you go.

16:34.392 --> 16:37.260
Same thing, right ?
Three steps back
from the wall.

16:37.328 --> 16:39.262
Chair in place,
head on the wall.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.999
Pick up the chair.
Can't stand up.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.035
Cannot stand up.
Can't get up.

16:45.103 --> 16:48.305
What are you ta--
gimme the chair !
No. Go ahead.

16:48.372 --> 16:51.075
Three steps back, right ?
Right.
One, two, three.

16:51.142 --> 16:53.276
Yeah. Okay.
Put the chair there.

16:53.344 --> 16:55.813
My head against the wall.
I lift up the chair.
Right.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.348
Yeah, now stra--
straighten up !
I can't straighten up !

16:58.416 --> 17:00.784
You didn't straighten up !
I know.
I just can't do it !

17:00.852 --> 17:03.320
That's the thing.
Yeah, but I
straightened up.

17:03.387 --> 17:06.223
What'd you do to the chair ?
<i>I didn't do anything</i>
<i>to the chair.</i>

17:06.290 --> 17:08.290
You're a liar.
What'd he do to the chair ?

17:08.358 --> 17:10.661
<i>He didn't do anything.</i>
<i>Get over here</i>
<i>and watch me.</i>

17:10.729 --> 17:12.663
All I did
was the same thing.

17:12.731 --> 17:15.766
It's the same chair
and the same wall.
One, two, three.

17:19.871 --> 17:21.872
Gimme the chair !

17:23.642 --> 17:26.109
One, two, three.
Put the chair there.
Right.

17:26.176 --> 17:28.112
Yeah.
Yeah.
Head against the wall.

17:28.179 --> 17:30.114
Pick it up.
[ Laughing ]

17:30.181 --> 17:32.182
Don't hurt yourself, dad.
That's a trick chair !

17:32.250 --> 17:35.519
- It's not a trick chair !
- If it ain't a trick chair,
any other chair will work.

17:35.586 --> 17:39.023
Any chair.
Okay.
All right,
I'll get another chair.

17:39.090 --> 17:43.560
Okay, ma.
One, two, three.

17:51.569 --> 17:53.570
¶ Da-da ¶

17:58.076 --> 18:01.011
¶ da-da ¶

18:01.079 --> 18:04.281
if she can do it,
there's a trick to it,
and I ain't interested.

18:04.348 --> 18:06.583
It's not a trick.
It's not a trick.

18:06.651 --> 18:08.819
Women can do it,
and men can't.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.588
You saw I couldn't do it.
It's just women
are built different.

18:11.656 --> 18:13.757
I been aware of that
for some time.

18:13.825 --> 18:16.794
No, I-I-I mean,
the pelvic construction
is such that--

18:16.861 --> 18:19.596
oh, please don't draw me
no "diaphragms," huh ?

18:22.200 --> 18:24.201
It's a dumb gag.
Where did you get it ?

18:24.268 --> 18:27.571
Roger showed it to us.
Oh, Roger
showed it to you.

18:27.638 --> 18:31.075
- Yeah, he brought it back
from england.
- Boy, I bet he can do it.

18:31.142 --> 18:34.411
Let's not start
any of that again, huh ?

18:34.478 --> 18:36.413
You told me that
a man can't do it.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.117
If a man can't do it,
I would imagine
your friend Roger-bell can.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.219
"Roger-bell," huh ?
"Roger-bell" ?

18:42.286 --> 18:44.755
You wanna know
who could lift
that chair, Archie ?

18:44.823 --> 18:46.790
I mean, not only
could he lift that chair,

18:46.858 --> 18:49.226
but he could prance
and flit all over
this room with it.

18:49.293 --> 18:51.228
Your friend Steve.

18:51.295 --> 18:54.497
Michael.
My friend Steve ?

18:54.565 --> 18:57.701
That's right, Archie,
and I wasn't gonna say it,
but it's true.

18:57.769 --> 19:01.304
That big football player...

19:01.372 --> 19:03.440
Is a flower ?

19:08.613 --> 19:11.615
You are <i>sick,</i>
<i>you know that ?</i>
<i>You need help !</i>

19:11.682 --> 19:13.617
Oh, now, daddy,
don't start in with--

19:13.684 --> 19:16.954
no, no ! I've listened
to this guy around here
for ten months !

19:17.021 --> 19:19.189
All his pinko stuff,
well, that's all right.

19:19.257 --> 19:22.059
That's what they're
fillin' 'em up with
in the schools nowadays.

19:22.127 --> 19:24.061
The clothes ?
Well, that's all right.

19:24.129 --> 19:26.696
They take from one another.
One kid looks crummier
than the next.

19:26.765 --> 19:31.935
Their wide-open sex
any time of the night or day
for no reason at all ?

19:32.003 --> 19:34.905
All right, that's your
"submissive" society.

19:34.973 --> 19:40.210
But when they goes besmearin'--
when they go besmearin' the name
of a great linebacker,

19:40.278 --> 19:44.414
a second choice all-American--
a man, and I mean a <i>real</i> man,

19:44.482 --> 19:48.152
then you might as well shut
the doors of this country
and hang out a sign:

19:48.219 --> 19:50.654
"Closed. Owner gone nuts."

19:53.724 --> 19:55.725
<i>[ Steve ]</i>
<i>Good shot !</i>
<i>Get those hands up !</i>

19:55.794 --> 19:58.095
<i>That-a-way !</i>
<i>Move that body !</i>

[ All shouting ]

20:01.800 --> 20:03.834
One shot ! Ahh !
Gotcha !

20:03.902 --> 20:06.469
Keep the hands up.
That-a-boy.
Feint, jab.

20:06.537 --> 20:08.471
[ Barney ]
Hit him
in the belly !

20:08.539 --> 20:12.176
[ Steve ]
Hit him with a left !
Move that left !

20:12.243 --> 20:15.946
That-a-boy.
Move it ! Yeah !
Come on !

20:16.014 --> 20:18.248
Come on.
This is it.
The knockout.

20:18.316 --> 20:21.484
No, no, the knockout's
in the tenth round.
This is the tenth round.

20:21.552 --> 20:23.720
Here it comes !
Bang ! Pow !
[ Shouting ]

20:26.724 --> 20:28.792
Hey, Steve.
Kelcy, I gotta go.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.161
Where you goin' ?
Where you goin',
you guys ?

20:31.229 --> 20:33.330
The old lady's
waitin' for me.
Okay, we'll see ya.

20:33.397 --> 20:35.866
[ Kelcy ]
Thanks for stoppin' by.
That was some fight, huh ?

20:35.934 --> 20:37.868
Great. You know
something, arch ?

20:37.936 --> 20:40.304
I love those combinations.
Hey, hey !
Take it easy there !

20:40.371 --> 20:42.672
The law says
them mitts of yours
are lethal weapons.

20:42.740 --> 20:45.042
You're nuts, Archie.
I was a ballplayer,
not a fighter.

20:45.109 --> 20:47.177
What's the difference ?
Look at the size of you.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.646
Boy, the strength--
hey, do me a favor.

20:49.714 --> 20:51.715
Let me try you once
with the arm.
Have another beer.

20:51.782 --> 20:54.117
Come on, come on.
One time.
Forget it.

20:54.185 --> 20:57.554
Are you serious ?
Certainly.
All right, go.

20:57.621 --> 20:59.789
[ Shouts ]
Oh, gee !

20:59.858 --> 21:03.160
Oh, beautiful !
Oh, gee.
Boy, what an arm !

21:03.228 --> 21:06.696
Oh, my-- when I think
of what that dopey
son-in-law of mine said--

21:06.764 --> 21:09.132
Mike still
buggin' you ?
Oh, well, I tell ya,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.168
it's-- it's--
it ain't only him.

21:11.236 --> 21:14.304
It's his whole generation.
Kelcy, bring us a couple
of beers over here.

21:14.372 --> 21:16.306
Right, arch.
I mean,
they got no regard.

21:16.374 --> 21:20.377
They got no respect
for the old institutions.
What institutions, Archie ?

21:20.444 --> 21:22.980
Well, you know, like sports,
sportsmanship there.

21:23.047 --> 21:26.683
Guts, guns-- the things
that separate the sexes,
you know what I mean ?

21:26.751 --> 21:28.685
Yeah, I think I know
what you mean.
Yeah.

21:28.753 --> 21:32.522
Here you go, guys.
Thanks. Uh, let me
ask you somethin' there.

21:32.590 --> 21:36.193
How long you know this,
uh, this kid Roger
that was in with Mike ?

21:36.261 --> 21:39.796
Oh, couple of years,
ever since he started
to come in the shop.

21:39.864 --> 21:42.165
Couple of years.
Now, you're a man of the world.

21:42.233 --> 21:46.203
Now, you must know
that this kid is kind of
a la-di-da, right ?

21:46.271 --> 21:48.338
Is that what Mike
thinks of Roger ?

21:48.406 --> 21:51.508
Oh, forget about
what Mike thinks. I can't
even tell you what he thinks.

21:51.575 --> 21:54.444
Hey, put them glasses
over here. I wanna
go with you once more.

21:54.512 --> 21:56.479
Go ahead.
Come on.
You're nuts.
All right.

21:56.547 --> 22:00.050
Let me get even.
One more time.
Get it up there.

22:00.118 --> 22:02.252
All right. Go !
[ Chuckling ]

22:02.320 --> 22:06.323
What does
Mike think, arch ?
Ah, Mike. Jeez.

22:06.391 --> 22:10.160
Well, for one thing,
he thinks that friend of his,
Roger, is straight.

22:10.228 --> 22:12.296
And for another thing--

22:12.363 --> 22:15.132
you're gonna wanna
bust him wide open
when I tell you this.

22:15.199 --> 22:17.134
I don't know where
he gets these brainstorms,

22:17.201 --> 22:19.803
but he thinks
that you're a--

22:19.870 --> 22:22.505
jeez, I can't even
say it to you, Steve.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.943
He's right, arch.
Huh ?

22:31.316 --> 22:33.716
He's right.

22:35.753 --> 22:37.955
You mean he's right
about his friend Roger.

22:38.022 --> 22:39.990
About everything.

22:41.125 --> 22:44.761
Aw, come on.
I mean--

22:44.829 --> 22:47.197
if you wanna joke about it,
all right, but come on.

22:47.265 --> 22:49.699
Get off it, huh, guy ?
<i>Arch.</i>

22:55.206 --> 22:58.875
How long you known me ?
Ten, twelve years ?
Yeah.

22:58.943 --> 23:01.845
In all that time,
did I ever mention a woman ?

23:01.912 --> 23:04.481
What difference does that make ?
You're a bachelor.

23:04.548 --> 23:06.516
<i>So ?</i>

23:06.584 --> 23:09.786
I know, but bachelors are--
they're always actin'
kinda private.

23:10.888 --> 23:12.589
Exactly.

23:14.558 --> 23:16.626
Aw, come on, Steve.

23:18.596 --> 23:20.597
I ain't the brightest guy
in the world.

23:20.664 --> 23:23.867
You wanna put me on,
put me on, but don't
tell me that you--

23:23.934 --> 23:27.104
I mean, look at you--
look at-- come on, will ya,
you big clown, you !

23:27.171 --> 23:30.673
Get outta here !
Have it
your own way, arch.

23:30.741 --> 23:34.611
The truth's in the eye
of the beholder anyway.
I'll see ya later, pal.

23:45.789 --> 23:48.725
Well, if that's
the punch of a fruit--

23:53.664 --> 23:55.732
nyah !

24:03.641 --> 24:07.577
Watch. I'll do it again.
Look. Just pick it up
and then stand up.

24:07.645 --> 24:09.679
Incredible.
It's amazing.
I can't believe--

24:09.747 --> 24:12.015
I couldn't do that.
Men can't do that.
Isn't that wild ?

24:12.083 --> 24:14.084
You try it, Jerry.

24:14.152 --> 24:16.586
Here you go.
Three steps back.
Right.

24:16.654 --> 24:18.655
Put the chair in.

24:20.491 --> 24:23.660
[ Giggling ]
Do it again.
I don't believe that.

24:26.164 --> 24:30.267
I thought you said a guy
couldn't do that ! I'm never
gonna trust youse two again !

24:30.334 --> 24:32.769
Daddy, I'd like you
to meet my friend,
Jerry woodner.

24:32.836 --> 24:34.704

Well, how do you do,

24:43.281 --> 24:45.215
Pleased to meet ya.

24:48.186 --> 24:50.187
