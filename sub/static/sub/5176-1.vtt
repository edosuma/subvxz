01:03.098 --> 01:06.168
I've just crossed the Iranian border
en route to the Habala region

01:06.268 --> 01:10.272
where they've ordered the destruction of
a network of caves by sundown tonight.

01:10.372 --> 01:14.109
I believe that these caves might contain
a critical missing piece of our history.

01:14.209 --> 01:19.081
If I'm found dead, please know that I
entered this country of my own free will,

01:19.181 --> 01:21.049
fully knowing that the
punishment for trespassing here

01:21.149 --> 01:25.952
is burial up to your neck in sand and
having a rock wall pushed on top of you.

01:27.455 --> 01:31.224
But they would have
to catch me first.

01:44.506 --> 01:46.906
Hurry. Come.

01:50.845 --> 01:54.583
- Scarlett.
- Reza. Thank you.

01:54.683 --> 01:57.953
If they catch you, it would
be very bad for you.

01:58.053 --> 02:01.187
- Yes, I know, Reza. We will be quick.
- Okay.

02:04.926 --> 02:06.492
Here it is.

02:07.729 --> 02:09.231
Here, use the ladder.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.729
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:16.171 --> 02:18.073
- We haven't got much time.
- I know, I know.

02:18.173 --> 02:21.910
- They have already cleared the area.
- I know, Reza. Hurry.

02:22.010 --> 02:24.610
Just follow me. Follow.

02:26.114 --> 02:27.413
Come on.

02:29.451 --> 02:31.486
- Watch your step here.
- It's fine. Go, just go.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.755
Yes. Come on.

02:33.855 --> 02:36.723
Turn off the light.
Turn off the light!

02:37.626 --> 02:41.429
Come on. Right this way.

03:10.225 --> 03:12.360
We need to leave. We are too late.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.963
No, they are not blowing
the caves up until sundown.

03:15.063 --> 03:18.231
We still have a few minutes.
We're not leaving.

03:19.801 --> 03:22.304
- Hurry, hurry!
- Yes.

03:25.106 --> 03:27.840
- Come on.
- Shit.

03:28.977 --> 03:29.978
There!

03:30.078 --> 03:32.981
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

03:33.081 --> 03:37.052
It's even more beautiful
than in the picture. Okay.

03:37.152 --> 03:39.318
We must hurry, please.

03:40.188 --> 03:41.754
Okay.

03:42.123 --> 03:43.689
There's more.

03:46.461 --> 03:50.665
- What are you doing?
- They're going to blow it up anyway.

03:50.765 --> 03:53.199
I can't think straight with
this thing on my head.

04:00.275 --> 04:03.342
- They will hear you. Stop!
- I just need one minute.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.152
Oh, my God.

04:27.302 --> 04:28.868
Oh, my God.

04:31.039 --> 04:32.207
- Reza?
- Yeah?

04:32.307 --> 04:33.808
- Do you know what this is?
- I don't know.

04:33.908 --> 04:37.636
Oh, my God. It's the Rose Key.

04:37.737 --> 04:39.714
- Oh, Reza.
- Careful.

04:39.814 --> 04:41.883
- Please hurry.
- I'll be quick.

04:41.983 --> 04:43.652
Scarlett, stop it. Come on.

04:43.752 --> 04:45.920
I have to scan these markings.
I'm not leaving.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.089
We must leave. Now! I can hear them.

04:48.189 --> 04:50.730
My father searched his entire
life for this. I can't leave now.

04:50.831 --> 04:53.495
- I have to get this.
- I'm sorry, Scarlett. I have a family!

04:53.595 --> 04:54.663
I know. It's okay.

04:54.763 --> 04:56.464
- Be careful.
- I won't be long.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.030
Be careful!

04:59.067 --> 05:00.935
Come on. Come on, Scarlett.

05:05.106 --> 05:06.706
Shit.

05:10.545 --> 05:12.745
Okay. Okay.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.116
<i>Scarlett.</i>

05:18.086 --> 05:19.652
Hello?

05:24.292 --> 05:25.758
<i>Scarlett.</i>

05:44.145 --> 05:46.545
Shit! Oh, God!

05:47.715 --> 05:51.117
Reza! Reza!

05:56.624 --> 05:59.728
Reza! Reza!

05:59.828 --> 06:02.897
Scarlett! Over here! Scarlett!

06:04.098 --> 06:05.464
Come over!

06:06.100 --> 06:07.569
Come on.

06:07.669 --> 06:10.503
Are you okay, dear? Are you okay?

06:11.573 --> 06:13.475
Come on. Give me your hand.

06:26.321 --> 06:28.854
I got it! I got it!

06:32.861 --> 06:35.595
You remind me so much of your father.

06:37.465 --> 06:41.336
But, Scarlett,
you must be more careful.

06:43.037 --> 06:47.139
His quest was a path to madness.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.578
My father wasn't crazy.

06:50.678 --> 06:55.881
Everyone who hunts for
Flamel's stone is crazy.

06:56.384 --> 06:58.918
They all wind up dead.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.358
<i>- Do I look in the camera?</i>
<i>- Yeah. Thank you.</i>

07:03.458 --> 07:04.960
<i>That's weird.</i>

07:05.460 --> 07:07.862
<i>So, you can start by
introducing yourself.</i>

07:07.962 --> 07:09.297
<i>Right.</i>

07:09.397 --> 07:14.235
My name is Scarlett Marlowe and I'm a
professor at University College, London.

07:14.335 --> 07:17.806
I have a Ph.D. in urban archeology,
a master's in chemistry

07:17.906 --> 07:20.475
and another Ph.D. in symbology.

07:20.575 --> 07:25.747
I'm also fluent in four spoken
languages and two dead ones.

07:25.847 --> 07:30.585
And I am a black belt in
Krav Maga, so watch out.

07:30.685 --> 07:33.087
That's a lot of degrees
for someone your age.

07:33.187 --> 07:37.390
Yeah. My father insisted.
We had a very studious household.

07:38.326 --> 07:40.226
Excuse me. One second.

07:43.231 --> 07:44.397
<i>- Pardon.</i>
<i>- Pardon.</i>

07:49.771 --> 07:50.972
<i>- Merci.</i>
<i>- Merci beaucoup.</i>

07:51.072 --> 07:52.771
Thank you.

07:54.676 --> 07:57.879
- You really need to learn French.
- Yeah, I do need to learn French.

07:58.079 --> 07:59.614
- Your father.
- Yeah.

07:59.714 --> 08:02.484
What did he teach you about
the philosopher's stone?

08:02.584 --> 08:06.254
Everything. That it's
an elusive substance

08:06.354 --> 08:12.527
that could turn base metals into gold
and can provide the key to eternal life.

08:12.627 --> 08:15.597
Sort of crude representation,
but basically

08:15.697 --> 08:18.366
the creation of the stone
was the goal of alchemy

08:18.466 --> 08:23.137
which was an early form of science which
studied transformation in all its forms.

08:23.237 --> 08:28.176
And my father was actually the world's
preeminent historian in alchemy.

08:28.276 --> 08:33.515
So, your father, there was a lot of
speculation that he was mentally unstable.

08:33.615 --> 08:36.115
Is there any truth to that?

08:37.952 --> 08:41.320
Why? Because he killed himself?

08:42.957 --> 08:47.362
Six hundred years ago the greatest
of the alchemists, Nicolas Flamel

08:47.462 --> 08:49.998
lived here, in this house in Paris.

08:50.098 --> 08:53.468
He was widely believed to have succeeded
in developing the philosopher's stone

08:53.568 --> 08:58.740
which would have given him all the wealth
he could dream of as well as eternal life.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.976
When grave robbers, hoping to get their
hands on the philosopher's stone

09:02.076 --> 09:07.015
tried to dig his body up out of the cemetery
that used to surround this area here

09:07.115 --> 09:10.449
they found his casket empty,
as well as his wife's.

09:11.686 --> 09:17.091
Okay. So this is Nicolas Flamel's tombstone
which he designed and carved himself.

09:17.191 --> 09:20.428
And my father believed that the clues to
the location of the philosopher's stone

09:20.528 --> 09:24.566
were encoded somehow
in these arcane symbols.

09:24.666 --> 09:29.504
But their meaning has remained a mystery
until I discovered the fabled Rose Key.

09:29.604 --> 09:35.174
It's a kind of Rosetta stone used for
translating alchemical symbols into Aramaic

09:35.278 --> 09:39.145
which, unfortunately, I don't speak.

09:40.282 --> 09:42.748
But luckily, I know a guy who does.

09:49.057 --> 09:53.559
- What are you doing?
- I just have to open this door quietly.

09:56.297 --> 09:58.297
Please don't. Scarlett!

10:04.305 --> 10:06.808
I can't believe you just did that.
We just broke into a church!

10:06.908 --> 10:09.241
What does this guy do
all the way up here?

10:10.678 --> 10:12.711
He likes to...

10:13.748 --> 10:16.549
...break into places, like this

10:16.884 --> 10:18.920
and fix things.

10:19.020 --> 10:22.323
- Impressive. That's a hell of a hobby.
- Yeah.

10:22.423 --> 10:25.224
George? Hello?

10:27.228 --> 10:31.564
I saw your bag, George.
I know you're here.

10:33.201 --> 10:36.237
Hi. How are you?

10:36.337 --> 10:37.905
Whatever it is, I want
nothing to do with it.

10:38.005 --> 10:41.540
- I didn't even say anything.
- I'll save you the time. No.

10:42.877 --> 10:45.647
- Who's this guy? Who are you?
- I'm Benji.

10:45.747 --> 10:48.449
He's making a documentary
about my search for the stone.

10:48.549 --> 10:51.519
Of course.

10:51.619 --> 10:54.822
Do yourself a favor.
Stay far away from this one.

10:54.922 --> 10:58.693
- I just need to ask you one favor.
- Yeah. Just one favor.

10:58.793 --> 11:03.164
Benji, did she mention to you,
the last time we were together

11:03.264 --> 11:06.367
I literally wound up
in a Turkish prison?

11:06.467 --> 11:09.637
George, it was not a prison.
It was more of a jail.

11:09.737 --> 11:13.072
Jail, in Turkey.

11:13.407 --> 11:17.345
George, I'm sorry. I couldn't
let the lead go dead.

11:17.445 --> 11:18.846
God forbid.

11:18.946 --> 11:23.184
Well, chase your lead.
See how far that gets you.

11:23.284 --> 11:25.918
I got a clock to fix.

11:27.221 --> 11:29.922
I found the Rose Key, George.

11:40.568 --> 11:42.303
You did?

11:42.403 --> 11:44.736
It was in Iran, wasn't it?

11:45.573 --> 11:46.972
Yes.

11:48.976 --> 11:49.977
I knew it.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.714
And I need your help
translating the Aramaic.

11:52.814 --> 11:54.613
Wait a minute.

11:56.617 --> 11:58.651
Did you go to Iran?

11:59.954 --> 12:03.691
- It doesn't matter who went there, George.
- You did, didn't you?

12:03.791 --> 12:05.524
By yourself?

12:06.761 --> 12:09.261
Doesn't matter who went.

12:11.332 --> 12:13.432
You're a lunatic.

12:14.936 --> 12:17.038
She... You're...

12:17.138 --> 12:19.874
You're a crazy lunatic.

12:26.714 --> 12:28.516
So, you fixed it.

12:28.616 --> 12:32.818
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!
Go, go, go. Come on.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.190
- Are you okay, Benji?
- Yeah, I'm good.

12:36.290 --> 12:39.393
Okay. It's about to get really loud.

12:39.493 --> 12:42.294
- Coming? You coming?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm good.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.564
Shit.

13:02.483 --> 13:04.085
Look at them.

13:04.385 --> 13:08.954
Hearing their church bells ring
for the first time in 284 years.

13:14.362 --> 13:18.764
I'll help you translate.
But that's it.

13:29.343 --> 13:30.545
She's pretty.

13:30.645 --> 13:34.013
Yeah, she's really pretty.
She's got great legs, too.

13:35.349 --> 13:37.084
She said we can have
10 minutes. That's it.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.550
Okay.

13:40.521 --> 13:45.057
- How do you know her?
- Professional circles.

13:45.493 --> 13:48.327
- Star is ammonia.
- Okay, great. Star is ammonia.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.563
- Is this making any sense?
- Just keep going. Just keep them going.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.317
- Lime.
- Sword is lime?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.869
- Sword is lime.
- Okay. And what about the key?

13:59.941 --> 14:01.309
No key.

14:01.409 --> 14:02.877
- There's no key?
- No.

14:02.977 --> 14:05.044
Why is there no key?

14:06.147 --> 14:09.548
He's carrying the key
on his back. Look.

14:11.552 --> 14:16.123
So, if he's carrying the key on his back,
does that mean that the key is on his back?

14:16.223 --> 14:18.459
- It's on the back of the tombstone.
- Scarlett. No.

14:18.559 --> 14:21.229
- I need to have a look behind here.
- Scarlett, no! Come on!

14:21.329 --> 14:23.064
- I need you to help me.
- Okay! Shit!

14:23.164 --> 14:25.064
- I need to see the back.
- Be careful. Let me...

14:25.733 --> 14:27.235
- Okay. I can't...
- Watch your foot.

14:27.335 --> 14:29.968
We're gonna have to put it
down because I can't see.

14:31.172 --> 14:32.604
Shit.

14:43.751 --> 14:45.987
- There's nothing there.
- I can see that.

14:46.087 --> 14:49.588
Ammonia sulfonate,
distilled, with lime.

14:51.192 --> 14:55.094
It's the mix of a couple of
basic cleaning products.

14:55.629 --> 14:57.930
- Help me out here, man.
- What are you doing?

14:59.367 --> 15:02.034
Okay. You don't want
to breathe this in.

15:03.137 --> 15:06.707
- This is not gonna end well.
- It's on the back. They will never see it.

15:06.807 --> 15:08.774
Oh, my God.

15:09.777 --> 15:12.413
- And I need some matches.
- Matches? No. No.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.248
- We're not burning that.
- Benji, give me your matches.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.450
- Scarlett, this is a museum! Are you out...
- Shut up!

15:16.550 --> 15:18.117
Shit!

15:19.286 --> 15:22.454
Oh, my God! This is not okay!

15:27.294 --> 15:29.130
Wow!

15:29.230 --> 15:31.463
Okay, that's pretty cool.

15:32.967 --> 15:36.902
That's not "go to jail" cool.
But that's really cool.

15:37.505 --> 15:39.071
Wow.

15:39.473 --> 15:40.408
Get your camera.

15:40.508 --> 15:43.744
"Winged vulture leads the way

15:43.844 --> 15:48.049
"with brightest light in darkest day.

15:48.149 --> 15:51.519
"Underneath the heaven's reign

15:51.919 --> 15:53.888
"what is lost shall be regained.

15:53.988 --> 15:58.559
"Halfway twixt the darkest gate

15:58.659 --> 16:02.763
"and this tablet laid
atop a pairèd fate."

16:02.863 --> 16:04.298
So, "Underneath the heaven's reign,

16:04.398 --> 16:07.401
- "what is lost shall be regained."
- "What is lost shall be regained."

16:07.501 --> 16:10.905
So that is, underneath the night sky

16:11.005 --> 16:14.175
or in the open?

16:14.275 --> 16:17.345
Or on the tablet. There's a
night sky right on the tablet.

16:17.445 --> 16:21.180
- Yes, good. Okay.
- So, darkest gate.

16:22.216 --> 16:25.686
Hell. Hell. Darkest gate,
the gates of Hell.

16:25.786 --> 16:26.921
- The gates of Hell.
- Right?

16:27.021 --> 16:31.258
Yeah. The gates of Hell. Okay,
but that doesn't give us anything.

16:31.358 --> 16:35.262
I mean, that's halfway between
this grave and the gates of Hell.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.130
No, wait. I have my dad's notebook.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.535
Oh, my God. Okay.

16:41.635 --> 16:46.474
So this marks what they believe to be the
distance between Heaven and Earth and Hell.

16:46.574 --> 16:50.144
If alchemists believed that the
number of the Devil was 741

16:50.244 --> 16:53.948
then it makes sense that they
would think that Hell was 741 feet

16:54.048 --> 16:56.450
- beneath the surface of the Earth, right?
- So halfway twixt...

16:56.550 --> 17:01.956
So, 370.5 feet beneath Flamel's tombstone
is where we'll find the stone!

17:02.056 --> 17:06.391
Wait. Hold on, guys. How are we
supposed to get 370 feet into the Earth?

17:07.261 --> 17:10.095
- The catacombs. Right?
- The what?

17:10.998 --> 17:13.134
Okay, we're in Paris, so

17:13.233 --> 17:17.003
there are over 200 miles of tunnels
right underneath our feet.

17:17.104 --> 17:20.574
That are holding the remains
of six million corpses.

17:20.674 --> 17:22.810
- Whoa, whoa. Six million corpses?
- Yeah.

17:22.910 --> 17:25.913
- That's where I would put it!
- Right. Of course you would.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.147
Flamel's grave was here.

17:27.248 --> 17:32.384
With the catacomb map,
would make it roughly...

17:33.120 --> 17:35.823
- There. Shit.
- Wait. Are you sure?

17:35.923 --> 17:38.192
- What is it? What happened?
- Shit!

17:38.292 --> 17:40.494
Catacombs don't go
under Flamel's grave.

17:40.594 --> 17:44.098
But if we burrowed
through this wall here...

17:44.198 --> 17:45.666
- No, you can't.
- In this tunnel...

17:45.766 --> 17:49.236
The walls are solid limestone.
There's no way you can burrow in.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.740
Plus, they've all been reinforced since
pieces of the city fell into the...

17:52.840 --> 17:55.609
- Well then...
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

17:55.709 --> 18:01.348
In 1774, about a hundred feet
of Avenue Denfert-Rochereau

18:01.448 --> 18:04.852
was literally swallowed up
into the ground by the city.

18:04.952 --> 18:07.555
A couple of years later,
the same thing happened...

18:07.655 --> 18:12.157
Barrière d'Enfer, right there.
Followed by a third collapse.

18:13.794 --> 18:16.630
Rue des Innocents.

18:16.730 --> 18:18.632
Why would the street
collapse if there's nothing

18:18.732 --> 18:22.570
- but solid ground underneath it?
- That's a good question, Benji.

18:22.670 --> 18:25.206
So there's a hidden chamber?

18:25.306 --> 18:26.974
It would appear so.

18:27.074 --> 18:30.144
- We have to get down there.
- You have to get down there.

18:30.244 --> 18:33.111
I don't go underground. Remember?

18:33.914 --> 18:36.984
Yes. Sorry.

18:37.084 --> 18:42.656
By the end of the 1700s, residents
from all over Paris began to complain

18:42.756 --> 18:47.428
about the horrible smell of the
bodies in the overcrowded cemetery.

18:47.528 --> 18:49.396
Something had to be done.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.663
Benji, get this.

18:56.337 --> 18:59.573
"Stop. This is the
empire of the dead."

18:59.673 --> 19:04.411
Wait, check out the patterns and crosses
that they made. It's beautiful.

19:04.511 --> 19:08.749
Six million bodies, almost three
times the population of Paris

19:08.849 --> 19:14.088
are housed in these quarries. Making it,
by far, the largest crypt in the world.

19:14.188 --> 19:16.757
Seriously, Scarlett,
this is creeping me out.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.094
Get this.

19:24.365 --> 19:27.535
"At the sound of the trumpet,
the dead will rise."

19:28.035 --> 19:31.605
Benji, here. Cimetière des Innocents.

19:31.705 --> 19:35.042
These remains are from the same
cemetery as the Flamel graves.

19:35.142 --> 19:38.710
Which means that...

19:42.916 --> 19:45.786
Yeah, we basically need to go

19:45.886 --> 19:48.489
about half a mile through this wall.

19:48.589 --> 19:52.826
We need to find a way into the
off-limits area of the catacombs.

19:52.926 --> 19:55.829
Go to the club called Le Showcase.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.396
Sorry?

19:59.566 --> 20:03.470
- Ask for Papillon. He'll bring you.
- Papillon?

20:03.570 --> 20:04.638
- Please!
- Thanks.

20:04.738 --> 20:07.474
Come back into the group.
Please. Come on.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.007
Sorry.

20:16.183 --> 20:17.685
Are you sure this is where
we're supposed to go?

20:17.785 --> 20:21.855
Yeah, I think it's...
I think it's just down here.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.257
- What's his name again?
- Papillon.

20:23.357 --> 20:24.825
- Papillon?
- Yeah.

20:24.925 --> 20:25.893
Okay.

20:28.862 --> 20:30.030
Papillon?

21:18.812 --> 21:19.880
Yes, what do you want?

21:19.980 --> 21:24.618
I need to get into the catacombs and
someone told me that you could take me.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.722
No, sorry. Do I look
like a tour guide to you?

21:28.822 --> 21:31.523
Do I look like a tourist?

21:32.860 --> 21:36.161
Okay, why would I want
to bring you down there?

21:37.164 --> 21:40.668
Because we have found a secret tunnel

21:40.768 --> 21:44.402
in the catacombs that no
one else knows about.

21:45.172 --> 21:46.740
Look.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.943
No. I know that place. We would
have found it if it was there.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.445
- No, you wouldn't have.
- Yes, we would.

21:51.545 --> 21:54.348
No, you wouldn't have,
because it was designed,

21:54.448 --> 21:57.017
years and years ago, to be invisible.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.753
Unless you knew it was there,
you would never find it.

21:59.853 --> 22:01.656
Why would that be?

22:01.756 --> 22:06.860
Because I believe it's
filled with treasure.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.128
You know what I mean?

22:08.228 --> 22:10.529
Treasure, yeah, I know what you mean.

22:11.532 --> 22:14.199
It's a joke. I mean, is she serious?

22:14.902 --> 22:17.702
I'm 100% serious.

22:17.971 --> 22:22.810
If it's true, me and my friends,
can we take half of the treasure?

22:22.910 --> 22:26.146
You can have all of the treasure.
It's not what I'm looking for.

22:26.246 --> 22:29.381
- Half is fine.
- Okay.

22:30.651 --> 22:33.487
- So you'll take us?
- Yes, I said okay.

22:33.587 --> 22:34.788
Try this.

22:34.888 --> 22:38.158
No, I'm sorry, I'm not going.

22:38.258 --> 22:40.794
- No, he's coming. He's coming.
- I'm not coming.

22:40.894 --> 22:43.063
George, come on, please.
I need your help.

22:43.163 --> 22:46.066
You can text me whatever you find
down there. I'm gonna be around...

22:46.166 --> 22:50.838
No. You can't. No cell phones
down there. The ground is too dense.

22:50.938 --> 22:52.539
We are so close.

22:52.639 --> 22:55.075
- I know.
- You know there's something there.

22:55.175 --> 22:58.379
Guys, meet my team.
This is Zed, our climber.

22:58.479 --> 23:02.614
- And this is Souxie, the banshee.
- Hi. <i>Ça va?</i>

23:03.617 --> 23:05.343
Souxie, the banshee.

23:10.924 --> 23:12.393
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:12.493 --> 23:14.695
- Then we go near <i>la plage.</i>
- Okay.

23:14.795 --> 23:16.163
And then it's a bit tricky.

23:16.263 --> 23:17.831
There's water to here.

23:17.931 --> 23:20.367
And we're prepared for that?
We have enough equipment?

23:20.467 --> 23:21.668
Yeah, we got everything.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.335
Zed, right? How do you know Papillon?

23:25.639 --> 23:29.109
Oh, I grew up with him.
He's my friend, you know.

23:29.209 --> 23:32.877
Do you know how he got
the scar on his hand?

23:34.281 --> 23:36.915
Don't talk about that to him.

23:38.385 --> 23:42.320
Souxie, what are the dangers that
we're facing when we go down there?

23:43.657 --> 23:48.529
If you run out of batteries,
with no flashlight, you will die.

23:48.629 --> 23:52.633
If you run out of water,
if you get hurt.

23:52.733 --> 23:57.117
And there are also dangers
like police and bats, rats,

23:57.218 --> 24:01.041
- claustrophobia, drowning, bugs.
- Yeah.

24:01.141 --> 24:03.544
- De Niro? You want to see De Niro?
- Yes, yes.

24:03.644 --> 24:05.377
Don't do it.

24:05.846 --> 24:09.814
- No. He's bad.
- Let me do De Niro.

24:11.485 --> 24:13.554
Fuck, man. Fuck.

24:13.654 --> 24:16.075
Just like that!

24:24.164 --> 24:25.499
You're up.

24:25.599 --> 24:28.735
- <i>Hey, yo, hey, yo...</i>
- Listen to that.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.737
- No. And it's over.
- Do it like that.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.339
Three seconds. You suck.

24:32.439 --> 24:37.244
Guys, when we leave the van,
we need to be quick, okay?

24:37.344 --> 24:41.081
Because if the police catch us
with all that stuff, we're fucked.

24:41.181 --> 24:42.947
- Okay?
- Okay.

24:44.685 --> 24:46.253
I'll walk you guys down
there but then I'm out.

24:46.353 --> 24:48.553
- Quick, quick.
- Go, go, go.

24:58.398 --> 25:00.534
Okay, Souxie.

25:00.634 --> 25:02.967
- Okay, make it quick, make it quick.
- Okay?

25:11.111 --> 25:12.777
Okay, wait.

25:14.615 --> 25:15.980
- Zed?
- Yeah.

25:20.721 --> 25:22.406
Can we keep going?

25:25.225 --> 25:26.960
- Congratulations.
- Okay.

25:27.060 --> 25:31.396
Okay. Now, we should
put our headlamps on.

25:37.738 --> 25:39.139
Let's go.

25:39.239 --> 25:40.307
Okay?

25:40.407 --> 25:42.976
- Can you check if mine is on?
- Where's yours?

25:43.076 --> 25:45.712
I'm not coming with you guys.
I told you a bunch of times.

25:45.812 --> 25:49.483
- Okay.
- I'm leaving you guys in a second.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.750
Just give it a minute.

25:52.686 --> 25:53.987
Here we are.

25:54.087 --> 25:55.355
- This is it.
- Where?

25:55.455 --> 25:57.324
- There?
- There.

25:57.424 --> 25:59.259
That's the hole that
you're going into?

25:59.359 --> 26:00.427
- Yeah.
- That's it?

26:00.527 --> 26:02.427
It's not a joke.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.065
Okay.

26:05.165 --> 26:08.168
- Wow.
- Let's do it.

26:08.268 --> 26:10.437
All right. Look,
before we go down there,

26:10.537 --> 26:14.608
I have installed pin-cams on
some of your headlamps. Hold on.

26:14.708 --> 26:17.275
Camera B, good, check.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.644
All right.

26:21.214 --> 26:24.618
All right, camera C, check.

26:24.718 --> 26:25.884
Let's go.

26:26.453 --> 26:27.955
- What's this?
- Good luck.

26:28.055 --> 26:31.391
Scarlett, I'm not... I shouldn't
have even come this far.

26:31.491 --> 26:34.127
- Please, I need you with me.
- I'm not. I'm sorry.

26:34.227 --> 26:35.493
Okay?

26:36.663 --> 26:39.032
- Are you sure you're not gonna regret this?
- Good luck.

26:39.132 --> 26:40.734
Okay.

26:40.834 --> 26:45.138
Listen, I don't know what you do but
you make up your mind now. Okay?

26:45.238 --> 26:47.639
- He's coming, he's coming.
- I'm not going.

26:54.314 --> 26:56.247
George! Come on!

26:56.850 --> 26:59.586
- George!
- Watch your head, watch your head!

26:59.686 --> 27:02.723
Quickly! Fucking Christ!
Are you out of your mind?

27:08.762 --> 27:12.263
Smoke bomb, look out! Go! Go! Go!

27:12.599 --> 27:13.734
Watch out!

27:13.834 --> 27:15.533
Go back! Go, go, go!

27:19.072 --> 27:20.605
Quiet!

27:22.209 --> 27:23.810
You okay?

27:28.949 --> 27:31.585
Let us make sure it's clear, okay?
Zed, Souxie.

27:31.685 --> 27:32.851
George.

27:33.220 --> 27:35.019
You stay! You stay!

27:35.689 --> 27:37.190
- George.
- What?

27:37.290 --> 27:39.860
I have a headlamp for you. Come here.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.261
Okay.

27:41.361 --> 27:44.462
- Let me just...
- Scarlett, I got it! I got it!

27:45.465 --> 27:50.371
I gotta turn it on. Hold on.
All right. Camera D, good, check.

27:50.971 --> 27:53.940
- Thank you.
- You really don't like caves, do you?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.475
- Is this working?
- Yeah.

27:55.575 --> 27:57.809
Okay. Thank you, Benji.

27:58.378 --> 28:00.447
What did I say?

28:00.547 --> 28:02.949
His little brother drowned in
a cave when they were young.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.485
- Shit.
- You didn't know. It's fine.

28:05.585 --> 28:06.818
All right.

28:08.822 --> 28:12.726
George, are you all right?

28:12.826 --> 28:15.927
- I will be.
- Yeah.

28:17.397 --> 28:20.300
You never returned
my calls after Turkey.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.302
I know.

28:22.402 --> 28:27.808
I just wanted to say that I'm
really sorry for leaving you there.

28:27.908 --> 28:29.440
I know.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.844
- Hey.
- What?

28:33.280 --> 28:36.316
I'm really glad that you're here.

28:36.416 --> 28:39.519
I don't care. I'm not
here for you, Scarlett.

28:39.619 --> 28:41.822
I agreed to be your
translator, that's it.

28:41.922 --> 28:44.856
- I know.
- I didn't wanna come down here.

28:47.427 --> 28:50.497
- But here I am.
- I'm sorry. George!

28:50.597 --> 28:53.033
The police will never catch Papillon.

28:53.133 --> 28:54.599
Okay, let's go.

28:57.204 --> 28:59.938
- George.
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

29:02.442 --> 29:05.443
That's me, the classic "Pap."

29:06.713 --> 29:08.479
Nice.

29:14.287 --> 29:15.954
We go through here.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.458
- Follow me, Benji.
- Right.

29:23.296 --> 29:24.862
Okay?

29:25.799 --> 29:28.702
- I probably should have worn boots.
- I offered you some.

29:28.802 --> 29:29.970
Fuck.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.372
It gets higher up here.
You'll be fine.

29:32.472 --> 29:33.638
Okay.

29:35.675 --> 29:37.644
How deep do you think we are?

29:37.744 --> 29:39.146
It's okay?

29:39.246 --> 29:41.346
Right. So where are we?

29:43.250 --> 29:45.917
- There.
- I make us there.

29:47.320 --> 29:51.022
George? You good?

29:52.926 --> 29:54.895
You got something for your
camera to go in water?

29:54.995 --> 29:56.496
- Yeah. I'm all set.
- Yeah, he's got a splash bag.

29:56.596 --> 29:57.762
Okay.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.500
It's going to get deeper.

30:08.408 --> 30:10.076
Rue Bezout.

30:10.176 --> 30:13.413
And there's a really cool room
in the other side, but...

30:13.513 --> 30:17.584
- But you have to swim through it.
- We're not going to go. Not this time.

30:17.684 --> 30:19.586
Maybe another time.

30:19.686 --> 30:22.787
Okay. This is the end.

30:24.057 --> 30:27.492
You good? This place is crazy.

30:28.561 --> 30:32.663
That's hot candles.
There's people in here.

30:37.971 --> 30:39.606
Come on.

30:52.319 --> 30:54.554
There is always some
weird peoples down here.

30:54.654 --> 30:56.587
You're not kidding.

31:02.729 --> 31:03.895
Shit!

31:07.600 --> 31:09.167
Okay.

31:09.569 --> 31:12.305
- We go through here.
- Really?

31:12.405 --> 31:18.111
And I suggest you pull your hands up
like this so these bones don't cut.

31:18.411 --> 31:21.181
No, no. We're not
going through there.

31:21.281 --> 31:22.649
Yes, it's the only way.

31:22.749 --> 31:26.253
Fuck that, man. I'm not
climbing over bones.

31:26.353 --> 31:29.689
- That's a great tour guide you got.
- What did you say?

31:29.789 --> 31:34.060
If you need a tour guide,
you get a tour guide who say,

31:34.160 --> 31:37.197
"Look over here, look over there"
and everything. But that's not me.

31:37.297 --> 31:39.432
If you want to find your
hidden treasure, that's the way.

31:39.532 --> 31:42.702
Wait. Papillon, look.
That isn't actually the right way.

31:42.802 --> 31:44.938
This one here. This is a
much more direct route.

31:45.038 --> 31:47.507
- Sometimes the wrong direction is better.
- No.

31:47.607 --> 31:49.676
- Nobody uses this corridor.
- Why not?

31:49.776 --> 31:51.778
It's a bad place.

31:51.878 --> 31:55.282
What do you mean, it's a bad place?
Is it dangerous or...

31:55.382 --> 31:59.719
Bad like, people who go in
this tunnel don't come out.

31:59.819 --> 32:02.923
We're talking about some kind
of urban legend or something.

32:03.023 --> 32:04.891
This could save us hours upon hours.

32:04.991 --> 32:07.294
You think because you see
something in a book, you know it?

32:07.394 --> 32:11.298
- Just look at the map, here.
- Okay, this? This is not the catacombs.

32:11.398 --> 32:16.136
This will not tell you anything. Tell me,
which ones are filled with water?

32:16.236 --> 32:19.306
Which ones have collapsed?
Which ones are evil?

32:19.406 --> 32:21.808
- You don't need to be yelling.
- You don't know!

32:21.908 --> 32:26.110
We had a friend named La Taupe.
In English, <i>"la taupe" c'est</i> "the mole."

32:27.013 --> 32:29.582
He lived down here for years.

32:29.682 --> 32:32.919
He knew every corridor of
every system, except this one.

32:33.019 --> 32:36.423
He knew there was something
horrible down there.

32:36.523 --> 32:39.392
But eventually, he had
to see what it was.

32:39.492 --> 32:41.828
He went inside and nobody
has seen him since.

32:41.928 --> 32:46.099
So if you want to take this way,
go ahead. Not with me.

32:46.199 --> 32:48.032
Or me.

32:48.735 --> 32:50.935
It's the best way.

32:52.739 --> 32:56.109
These people have been
here before. We haven't.

32:56.209 --> 33:01.414
If that rock is down here,
then it's been down here for 600 years.

33:01.514 --> 33:03.750
I think it can wait a
couple more hours.

33:03.850 --> 33:07.087
- These are human bones!
- I know.

33:07.187 --> 33:08.989
- Benji, nobody wants to do this.
- And you're cool with this?

33:09.089 --> 33:11.722
- I'm sorry, Benji, I really am.
- Let's go. Let's just go.

33:13.259 --> 33:18.965
Okay, look at Zed. And use,
like him, all your legs and arms

33:19.065 --> 33:21.892
- because there is rats under...
- Are you fucking serious, man?

33:21.993 --> 33:24.969
- No, no, no...
- First bones, now rats?

33:27.407 --> 33:29.540
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

33:30.777 --> 33:32.944
I'm just fucking kidding!

33:33.646 --> 33:36.182
That's fucked up, man! Asshole.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.885
- I'm right behind you.
- It's actually not too bad.

33:38.985 --> 33:40.520
Let's do this.

33:40.620 --> 33:43.588
Give me that. Mind your feet.

33:45.758 --> 33:49.460
Just keep it slow and steady, yeah?
Watch your head.

33:50.463 --> 33:51.963
Fuck!

34:04.811 --> 34:06.577
Are you all right?

34:07.981 --> 34:11.315
No, no. I think I'm stuck.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.417
I can't see you.

34:14.254 --> 34:16.056
- Benji!
- Piece of shit bag.

34:16.156 --> 34:19.059
- You okay, buddy?
- Okay. Fuck.

34:19.159 --> 34:22.161
- Just move your shoulder down.
- No, no, no. I'm stuck.

34:22.262 --> 34:24.998
- Just move back, Benji.
- I'm stuck. Fuck!

34:25.098 --> 34:26.533
Just calm down. It's okay.

34:26.632 --> 34:30.036
- No, no. I can't breathe.
- No, it's okay. Benji, you can.

34:30.136 --> 34:34.940
Look, you should go. Just keep
going, please! Fuck. Fuck!

34:35.041 --> 34:37.377
- You have to move back!
- No, just go, God damn it!

34:37.476 --> 34:39.846
- Move back a bit, please.
- God! Why are they singing?

34:39.946 --> 34:43.248
Why are they singing this fucking song?
Just tell them to shut the fuck up!

34:43.349 --> 34:46.085
You're gonna have to
calm down, okay, Benji?

34:46.186 --> 34:47.187
Fuck! Fuck!

34:47.286 --> 34:49.054
Benji, just calm down, okay?

34:49.155 --> 34:51.925
Just breathe with me,
please. It's okay.

34:52.025 --> 34:54.293
Scarlett, you gotta
get out of the way.

34:54.393 --> 34:57.097
Just get out of the way.
Just get out of the fucking way!

34:57.197 --> 34:59.365
You are gonna have to move
back a tiny bit, please.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.868
I can't move back. Just go forward!

35:01.968 --> 35:03.703
- Just a tiny bit.
- Go forward!

35:03.803 --> 35:06.106
You have to flatten out the bones.
Benji, calm down.

35:06.206 --> 35:10.477
Fuck! Shit! I think something bit me.
Something bit me! Fuck!

35:10.577 --> 35:12.445
Benji, just breathe!

35:12.545 --> 35:15.748
- Benji, just listen to my voice.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

35:15.848 --> 35:18.418
Just breathe, please.
You need to calm down.

35:18.518 --> 35:21.054
You are hyperventilating, okay?

35:21.154 --> 35:24.424
You will be all right.
We just need to take it slowly.

35:24.524 --> 35:28.359
Now, breathe with me.
Just breathe with me, okay?

35:29.095 --> 35:34.634
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Just line up the bones.

35:34.734 --> 35:37.270
You will be all right.
Just keep coming.

35:37.370 --> 35:40.240
Just move them out of the way.
Good, good, good.

35:40.340 --> 35:42.942
Well done. Keep coming.
And now move forward.

35:43.042 --> 35:46.246
Just inch yourself forward.
Well done.

35:46.346 --> 35:48.748
- There we go, keep coming.
- Shit!

35:48.848 --> 35:52.018
- Keep going.
- Shit!

35:52.118 --> 35:53.119
What was that?

35:53.219 --> 35:56.256
- Fuck. I think it's gonna collapse!
- Go!

35:58.258 --> 36:02.362
Grab the fucking camera! Grab it!
Just grab the fucking camera!

36:02.462 --> 36:05.396
Hurry! Keep coming! Quickly!

36:06.699 --> 36:08.265
Fuck!

36:15.942 --> 36:18.943
- Benji!
- Is he okay?

36:20.246 --> 36:21.479
Fuck!

36:26.286 --> 36:27.485
Fuck.

36:29.989 --> 36:31.925
It's collapsed.

36:32.225 --> 36:34.625
That was so fucking close.

36:38.298 --> 36:40.900
- Oh, my God.
- Wait.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.166
Fuck.

36:44.003 --> 36:46.839
Wait. Tell me we didn't
just go in a circle.

36:46.939 --> 36:49.809
- This isn't here.
- This is the same tunnel, no?

36:49.909 --> 36:52.679
This isn't here.
Believe me. No, no, no.

36:52.779 --> 36:54.914
Look, I thought you said you
knew where we were going!

36:55.014 --> 36:56.781
Wait. Listen to me.

36:58.685 --> 37:01.254
Hey, hey, hey, Benji! Stop it!

37:01.354 --> 37:04.524
Listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Benji, I'm sorry!

37:04.624 --> 37:08.261
- Calm down!
- But listen to me. This doesn't go here.

37:08.361 --> 37:09.762
- Okay, calm down.
- This is the tunnel.

37:09.862 --> 37:13.030
There is no turns. There is no turns.

37:13.633 --> 37:15.766
This is straight.

37:16.636 --> 37:17.670
I don't understand.

37:17.770 --> 37:20.137
What the hell do we do now?

37:27.280 --> 37:29.382
This is all right. Okay.

37:29.482 --> 37:32.218
- We shouldn't go this way.
- Let's go, grab your shit.

37:32.318 --> 37:34.954
- We shouldn't go in there!
- There's no other option.

37:35.054 --> 37:38.558
Are you all right, Benji?
Let me help. Let me help.

37:38.658 --> 37:39.957
Okay.

37:44.964 --> 37:46.330
Okay.

37:53.573 --> 37:55.606
What the hell is this?

37:56.342 --> 37:59.212
Great. Very funny. So you
have never been here before.

37:59.312 --> 38:00.580
No.

38:02.148 --> 38:04.584
- I've never been here, okay?
- What the hell is this, then?

38:04.684 --> 38:08.821
- People just tag your name on the wall?
- I swear I've never been here.

38:08.921 --> 38:11.224
- I didn't do this, okay?
- Who did it, then?

38:11.324 --> 38:13.660
- I don't know. I don't know.
- For goodness' sake.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.995
You better not be fucking with us.

38:22.068 --> 38:25.738
Did you hear that? Is that a phone?

38:25.838 --> 38:27.273
Are there phones down here?

38:27.373 --> 38:30.576
The phone company used to run
lines through here, but they...

38:30.676 --> 38:33.146
- Run lines through here?
- Yeah.

38:33.246 --> 38:35.682
- They must have left some.
- No.

38:35.782 --> 38:38.685
Fifty years ago,
they took everything.

38:43.089 --> 38:45.155
- Go.
- This is wrong.

38:49.462 --> 38:51.528
Scarlett! Scarlett!

38:52.532 --> 38:55.301
Barrière d'Enfer. This is the
spot I was talking about.

38:55.401 --> 38:59.272
This is where the buildings collapsed
into the ground. Hundreds of people

38:59.372 --> 39:02.273
fell to their death right here.

39:02.875 --> 39:04.208
Yes.

39:05.378 --> 39:10.447
And when they sent people
to fix it, 50 more disappeared.

39:16.222 --> 39:19.893
How the hell did they
get a piano down here?

39:20.293 --> 39:23.460
Maybe it fell when one
of the houses collapsed.

39:24.997 --> 39:27.097
You gotta be kidding.

39:29.469 --> 39:32.872
When I was a kid, we had a piano
that looked exactly like this.

39:32.972 --> 39:34.340
Really?

39:34.440 --> 39:37.176
Danny and I used to play it all
the time. We only knew one song.

39:37.276 --> 39:39.309
<i>My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean.</i>

39:39.846 --> 39:42.849
You remember that song?

39:42.949 --> 39:47.351
We could never finish it because
the A4 key was fucked up.

39:49.188 --> 39:52.256
- George...
- This is a trip.

40:07.139 --> 40:09.340
What's going on?

40:10.142 --> 40:13.079
I told you. We shouldn't be here.

40:13.179 --> 40:14.514
- We should keep going.
- Guys, no.

40:14.614 --> 40:16.380
We should keep moving.

40:28.895 --> 40:31.795
- Fuck that. I'm going.
- Scarlett!

40:34.534 --> 40:36.233
Scarlett!

40:41.073 --> 40:43.040
It's coming from down here.

40:44.043 --> 40:48.178
- Wait, wait! Scarlett!
- Hold up, Scarlett!

40:58.391 --> 41:01.692
- Scarlett!
- Wait.

41:20.613 --> 41:24.951
- Hello?
- <i>Why won't you talk to me, Scarlett?</i>

41:25.051 --> 41:27.186
- Scarlett, hang up.
- Who is this?

41:27.286 --> 41:28.654
Hang up the phone, Scarlett.

41:28.754 --> 41:33.524
<i>- Tell me. Why won't you talk to me?</i>
- Who is this?

41:41.934 --> 41:44.303
- Scarlett...
- You shouldn't be here.

41:48.374 --> 41:51.875
- Who is that?
- La Taupe, <i>c'est toi?</i>

41:53.579 --> 41:56.282
You shouldn't be here, Souxie.

41:56.382 --> 41:59.719
- La Taupe?
- None of you should be here.

41:59.819 --> 42:01.387
La Taupe.

42:01.787 --> 42:04.455
- That's La Taupe?
- I thought you were dead.

42:05.658 --> 42:08.961
You never even came to look for me.

42:09.061 --> 42:10.594
Never.

42:10.896 --> 42:12.396
La Taupe...

42:12.665 --> 42:14.400
Never.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.133
La Taupe.

42:16.435 --> 42:18.368
You're okay?

42:19.238 --> 42:20.673
Come.

42:20.773 --> 42:24.343
- Where? Wait.
- He doesn't know where we're going.

42:24.443 --> 42:28.746
- You are looking to get out.
- Yes. Yes.

42:29.782 --> 42:31.181
Come.

42:33.486 --> 42:36.489
- Benji, wait for them. Let him go first.
- How did he get up there so fast?

42:36.589 --> 42:37.523
- Zed?
- Yeah.

42:37.623 --> 42:38.724
Is that the guy that
you were saying...

42:38.824 --> 42:41.027
- Disappeared two years ago?
- Yes.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.663
Jesus, Jesus.

42:43.763 --> 42:46.265
- Okay.
- Is that bad? Is that bad?

42:46.365 --> 42:47.366
It looks bad.

42:47.466 --> 42:51.237
- We shouldn't stay very long.
- That is bad.

42:51.337 --> 42:53.673
Quickly, guys. Wait. Where did he go?

42:53.773 --> 42:54.740
Come on.

42:54.840 --> 42:57.243
- Are you okay?
- Go, just go!

42:57.343 --> 42:59.078
Let's go! Let's go!

42:59.178 --> 43:00.212
La Taupe! Wait!

43:00.312 --> 43:01.845
La Taupe?

43:04.316 --> 43:05.582
Everybody's here?

43:09.455 --> 43:10.854
Careful.

43:20.833 --> 43:22.633
Where is he?

43:23.102 --> 43:24.086
Here.

43:24.187 --> 43:27.805
- Okay.
- How can he see down here?

43:31.177 --> 43:34.344
The only way out is down.

43:35.748 --> 43:37.047
What?

43:42.988 --> 43:44.655
Careful, Benji.

43:45.524 --> 43:47.057
Careful.

44:00.606 --> 44:02.806
Silent, silent.

44:08.347 --> 44:10.013
It looks deep.

44:10.516 --> 44:13.219
This is a bad idea.

44:13.619 --> 44:16.053
This space that we're
looking for, the hidden chamber...

44:17.423 --> 44:20.626
Didn't you notice that
it was perfectly wedged

44:20.726 --> 44:25.331
between the east system and the
south system of the catacombs?

44:25.431 --> 44:28.084
- So it's got to connect them.
- Yeah. Exactly.

44:28.184 --> 44:31.437
If we find the chamber, then that's
the way out. We'll find a way out.

44:31.537 --> 44:34.440
- Are you sure?
- I think. I'm sure.

44:34.540 --> 44:38.909
- What if there's no chamber?
- There is. It's down there.

44:39.745 --> 44:41.147
Okay.

44:41.547 --> 44:44.316
George, it's another 20 meters.

44:44.416 --> 44:47.186
- Are you at the bottom?
- Yeah.

44:47.286 --> 44:50.053
Okay. I'll be down in a second.

44:50.890 --> 44:54.293
- Benji? You good?
- Benji, you can start now.

44:54.393 --> 44:55.792
All right, good.

44:59.598 --> 45:00.700
Fucking harness.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.302
- You okay, Benji, up there?
- Okay.

45:03.402 --> 45:08.140
- Come on, George, keep coming.
- Hold on. I'm stuck. Shit!

45:08.240 --> 45:10.107
Benji, watch out!

45:11.610 --> 45:13.713
Fuck! Shit!

45:13.813 --> 45:15.214
Fuck! My hands!

45:15.314 --> 45:17.149
- Benji, what happened?
- I don't know!

45:17.249 --> 45:18.918
- Benji, are you okay?
- My hands.

45:19.018 --> 45:21.487
No. Oh, my God. The clip broke.

45:21.587 --> 45:24.955
- What? How?
- I don't know!

45:28.027 --> 45:29.729
I got you. I got you.

45:29.829 --> 45:33.588
Fresh bandages in one of
the packs. Just let me know...

45:33.689 --> 45:35.935
- if you want me to change them.
- All right, let's go.

45:36.035 --> 45:37.601
Guys?

45:38.204 --> 45:40.372
Yeah. We're going, we're good.

45:40.472 --> 45:42.575
- All good?
- Sort of.

45:42.675 --> 45:45.175
His hands are still bleeding.

45:45.811 --> 45:48.047
So I bandaged them up.

45:48.147 --> 45:50.147
Is he getting any...

45:51.951 --> 45:54.284
Are you all right?

45:55.020 --> 45:56.853
George?

45:57.790 --> 46:01.124
- Scarlett!
- What?

46:17.209 --> 46:18.210
I can't hear...

46:41.232 --> 46:42.399
You all right?

46:43.569 --> 46:44.737
- Everyone?
- Yeah!

46:44.837 --> 46:46.336
You okay?

46:47.439 --> 46:49.408
- Are you okay?
- What was that?

46:49.508 --> 46:53.746
The question is not what
was that, but who was that.

46:53.846 --> 46:55.648
What the fuck does he mean by that?

46:55.748 --> 46:56.916
What did he say?

46:57.016 --> 47:00.417
Papillon, how long have
you known this guy?

47:01.220 --> 47:03.088
He's different now.

47:03.188 --> 47:05.422
Should we be following him?

47:06.025 --> 47:07.526
I don't know.

47:07.626 --> 47:09.929
- There seems to be a right turn.
- There is a door!

47:10.029 --> 47:11.363
- Come here, come here.
- A door!

47:11.463 --> 47:14.133
- Benji.
- Thank God!

47:14.233 --> 47:16.767
- Watch your head, Benji.
- Come on.

47:18.704 --> 47:20.806
Shit! It's a dead end!

47:20.906 --> 47:22.708
You said this is the way.

47:22.808 --> 47:25.611
- I thought it was the way, too.
- Yeah?

47:30.482 --> 47:33.986
Hey. Everyone calm down!

47:34.086 --> 47:37.123
- Calm down.
- We can't go back.

47:37.223 --> 47:39.358
- Scarlett.
- Yeah. What?

47:39.458 --> 47:42.426
- Come here.
- Oh, my God!

47:44.997 --> 47:49.001
- "Winged vulture leads your way..."
- "With brightest light in darkest day."

47:49.101 --> 47:53.737
Leads your way. So this is...
Leads your way.

47:54.340 --> 47:56.573
Watch out. Watch out.

47:58.310 --> 47:59.812
- There's something here!
- What?

47:59.912 --> 48:02.913
Is that a scarab? Is that a scarab?

48:03.582 --> 48:05.517
Scarab.

48:05.617 --> 48:07.720
Egyptians, pyramids.

48:07.820 --> 48:10.522
- Pharaohs. Pharaohs.
- Pharaohs. Pharaohs.

48:10.622 --> 48:14.426
Didn't pharaohs have a strange
way of hiding the tombs?

48:14.526 --> 48:17.263
Yes! Yes! A Ptolemaic hinge!

48:17.363 --> 48:19.698
I have never seen... Could this be...

48:19.798 --> 48:22.868
One second, can you just explain? What are
you talking about? What's a Ptolemaic?

48:22.968 --> 48:25.938
Ptolemaic hinge. Basically,
they form a kind of riddle.

48:26.038 --> 48:29.708
It's a sort of ancient
Egyptian padlock.

48:29.808 --> 48:33.445
So you have to take the exact right
stone from the exact right place, or...

48:33.545 --> 48:35.278
Or what?

48:36.382 --> 48:37.547
Or what?

48:38.984 --> 48:41.387
Or the ceiling will collapse
on you and kill you.

48:41.487 --> 48:44.790
- What? Are you kidding?
- You have to be shitting me!

48:44.890 --> 48:45.858
It's fine. It's okay.

48:45.958 --> 48:48.839
"Underneath heaven's reign."
What does it say on the tomb?

48:48.940 --> 48:51.864
Underneath heaven's reign.
Underneath heaven's reign.

48:51.964 --> 48:55.034
Celestial spheres. The celestial spheres!
Eight planets, right?

48:55.134 --> 48:58.938
Wait, wait, wait. But the last
two weren't discovered yet.

48:59.038 --> 49:00.639
- Okay, so 6 planets.
- 6 planets.

49:00.739 --> 49:02.708
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Wait, wait, wait.

49:02.808 --> 49:04.310
- Scarlett. Scarlett!
- Yes. What?

49:04.410 --> 49:05.577
Don't touch anything.

49:05.677 --> 49:08.848
- Was this built before or after Copernicus?
- Before.

49:08.948 --> 49:11.050
So, they still believed everything
revolved around the Earth.

49:11.150 --> 49:12.551
Which means the Earth
didn't count as a planet.

49:12.651 --> 49:15.230
- Right. But the Moon did.
- And so did the Sun.

49:15.331 --> 49:18.490
So, 7 planets, right?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

49:18.590 --> 49:19.558
- Be sure.
- 7.

49:19.658 --> 49:21.593
- That's my count.
- 7.

49:21.693 --> 49:23.462
Stand way the fuck back.

49:23.562 --> 49:24.897
- Watch out!
- It's moving!

49:24.997 --> 49:26.530
Shit! Okay.

49:29.601 --> 49:32.736
Be careful! Be careful!
It's fucking heavy!

49:33.605 --> 49:35.071
Okay, it's moving!

49:36.508 --> 49:38.341
- Watch out!
- Okay. Okay!

49:40.079 --> 49:41.847
- Careful!
- Shit!

49:43.749 --> 49:45.215
Oh, my God!

49:48.787 --> 49:49.922
- Shit!
- You okay?

49:50.022 --> 49:51.621
- What is that?
- What is that?

49:53.459 --> 49:54.624
Oh, my God!

49:56.028 --> 49:58.956
George, this is the first time
someone has shined a light

49:59.057 --> 50:02.034
in this tunnel for over 500 years.

50:02.134 --> 50:04.203
It's the fucking way out.

50:04.303 --> 50:06.171
The treasure. The treasure!

50:06.271 --> 50:08.474
- Someone give me a boost.
- Be careful.

50:08.574 --> 50:10.476
Scarlett, please be careful!

50:10.576 --> 50:12.144
- It's fine.
- Careful.

50:12.244 --> 50:14.113
Yeah. I'm good.

50:14.213 --> 50:15.180
- Scarlett?
- Yeah.

50:15.280 --> 50:17.914
- What do you see?
- Oh, my God!

50:18.717 --> 50:19.685
- Oh, my God!
- What?

50:19.785 --> 50:22.619
George, you have to see this!
Oh, my God!

50:27.593 --> 50:29.292
Wow.

50:32.631 --> 50:34.898
What is this place?

50:35.667 --> 50:38.404
- He's dead.
- Yeah.

50:38.504 --> 50:41.306
He's dead, but how is he not rotting?

50:41.406 --> 50:43.142
I have no idea. George, look at this.

50:43.242 --> 50:45.242
- What is that?
- "VITRIOL."

50:47.012 --> 50:49.481
- Why VITRIOL?
- It's the motto of alchemy.

50:49.581 --> 50:50.582
VITRIOL?

50:56.321 --> 50:59.430
Visit the interior parts of the Earth,
by rectification thou shalt...

50:59.531 --> 51:01.566
- find the hidden stone.
- The hidden stone.

51:01.667 --> 51:03.395
- Fuck!
- Is he dead?

51:03.495 --> 51:06.598
- Yeah. For 700 years.
- Oh, my God!

51:06.698 --> 51:08.265
It's creepy.

51:09.334 --> 51:11.935
Wait. Visit the interior
parts of the Earth.

51:13.805 --> 51:15.274
He's telling us to go deeper.

51:15.374 --> 51:17.242
- I think it means we're here.
- No.

51:17.342 --> 51:19.078
This has got to be the
interior parts of the Earth.

51:19.178 --> 51:22.381
No, there has got to be more.
"Winged vulture leads your way,

51:22.481 --> 51:26.116
with brightest light in darkest day."
Brightest light in darkest day.

51:28.387 --> 51:31.123
- Everyone turn off your headlamps.
- Nah, fuck that.

51:31.223 --> 51:33.292
- Benji, it will be okay.
- There is a dead man right there.

51:33.392 --> 51:34.958
It will be okay.

51:36.028 --> 51:37.196
Everyone.

51:37.296 --> 51:38.528
Okay.

51:38.864 --> 51:40.966
- Scarlett?
- Holy shit.

51:41.066 --> 51:42.534
- Look!
- Yeah.

51:42.634 --> 51:45.304
Where's this light coming
from if that's a wall?

51:45.404 --> 51:48.474
Benji, turn your camera
light on. Please.

51:48.574 --> 51:50.607
Scarlett, what are you doing?

51:51.810 --> 51:55.080
I reckon we can get through there.

51:55.180 --> 51:59.249
- Scarlett, what are you doing?
- There's a loose stone.

52:02.321 --> 52:03.753
Okay.

52:05.057 --> 52:07.257
Can you see anything down there?

52:14.533 --> 52:15.801
- What is it?
- Is something in there?

52:15.901 --> 52:18.902
- I'm going.
- What? Scarlett, no!

52:21.773 --> 52:23.506
Scarlett!

52:33.185 --> 52:34.851
Oh, my God.

52:46.465 --> 52:47.964
Shit!

52:48.867 --> 52:50.836
- Get out of the way.
- You're going?

52:50.936 --> 52:52.102
Yeah.

52:54.873 --> 52:55.841
- Zed.
- What?

52:55.941 --> 52:57.374
Give me my bag.

53:08.553 --> 53:11.521
Wow. Is this it?

53:13.091 --> 53:14.924
It's real.

53:17.095 --> 53:18.762
It's real.

53:30.942 --> 53:32.842
Holy shit!

53:41.586 --> 53:43.153
Scarlett.

53:45.290 --> 53:46.689
Benji.

53:47.526 --> 53:51.863
Let's not celebrate until we're out of here.
Scarlett, how are these torches still lit?

53:51.963 --> 53:55.231
The philosopher's stone can
fuel a lamp for eternity.

53:55.767 --> 53:57.934
Where is it? Where's the stone?

53:58.837 --> 54:02.138
"Brightest light in darkest day."
Think about it.

54:04.376 --> 54:06.745
- Brightest light.
- Yeah.

54:06.845 --> 54:08.113
The Sun.

54:08.213 --> 54:11.783
In ancient Egypt,
they said that the Earth god

54:11.883 --> 54:15.454
and the sky goddess
were madly in love.

54:15.554 --> 54:18.123
But when they had their
first child, the Sun,

54:18.223 --> 54:21.526
he became so jealous of their
affections that he pushed them apart

54:21.626 --> 54:26.898
so that they were only able to
touch by the palms of their hands

54:26.998 --> 54:29.067
and the soles of their feet.

54:29.167 --> 54:34.306
Every morning, the sky goddess
gave birth to the Sun,

54:34.406 --> 54:36.506
and every evening

54:37.509 --> 54:40.646
- she would swallow him back up.
- That's it!

54:40.746 --> 54:43.513
Oh, my God. It looks so ordinary.

54:58.930 --> 55:01.166
What better place to hide the
most valuable stone ever known

55:01.266 --> 55:03.802
than next to riches
you could never miss?

55:03.902 --> 55:06.936
Wait. It's a trap. Stop! It's a trap!

55:07.439 --> 55:09.675
Stop! It's a trap! Wait!

55:26.191 --> 55:28.827
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

55:28.927 --> 55:30.260
I am, yes.

55:30.962 --> 55:32.128
Benji?

55:34.032 --> 55:36.266
- Scarlett?
- I'm good!

55:37.302 --> 55:38.468
Zed?

55:39.771 --> 55:41.314
Let me see.

55:42.274 --> 55:43.608
Souxie?

55:43.708 --> 55:45.375
- Souxie?
- Souxie?

55:45.744 --> 55:46.945
Souxie?

55:47.045 --> 55:49.114
- Souxie?
- Souxie!

55:49.214 --> 55:50.380
Get those rocks! Get her!

55:52.617 --> 55:53.883
Shit!

55:54.753 --> 55:55.854
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

55:55.954 --> 55:57.887
- Are you okay?
- Okay, get her.

55:59.558 --> 56:01.824
Sit. Are you hurt?

56:02.727 --> 56:05.030
La Taupe? Where's La Taupe?

56:05.130 --> 56:07.263
- La Taupe!
- La Taupe!

56:08.900 --> 56:10.466
- La Taupe!
- La Taupe!

56:11.436 --> 56:12.471
Help me dig!

56:12.571 --> 56:15.073
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- He can't breathe!

56:15.173 --> 56:17.175
Don't disturb the rocks!

56:17.275 --> 56:19.576
George, they might collapse on us!

56:20.278 --> 56:21.480
Fuck!

56:21.580 --> 56:24.514
We can't move the rocks. We can't.

56:26.017 --> 56:27.819
There's no use. There's no use.

56:27.919 --> 56:30.423
- No use, Papillon?
- No!

56:31.323 --> 56:33.191
I need the first-aid kit.
I have to clean it.

56:33.291 --> 56:35.627
- No, don't touch it!
- The packs are buried.

56:35.727 --> 56:37.496
- What do you mean they're buried?
- They're buried!

56:37.596 --> 56:39.030
- Do we have anything?
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

56:39.130 --> 56:41.831
Where's our water? Our food?

56:43.134 --> 56:45.871
Do we have any batteries?
For the lights?

56:45.971 --> 56:47.906
Yeah, we should start
conserving the lights.

56:48.006 --> 56:49.574
- Shit!
- What do I do?

56:49.674 --> 56:51.076
Just keep it up,
so that it stops bleeding.

56:51.176 --> 56:52.342
Okay.

56:55.013 --> 56:58.615
Okay. It's all right. It's okay.

56:59.184 --> 57:00.350
This might sting.

57:04.055 --> 57:05.521
Just a sting.

57:09.961 --> 57:12.029
It's okay. It's okay.

57:25.210 --> 57:29.012
Holy shit! It really worked.

57:30.181 --> 57:32.217
How did you do that?

57:32.317 --> 57:34.486
It's the stone.

57:34.586 --> 57:36.719
- You okay?
- Yeah.

57:41.560 --> 57:43.226
It will be okay.

57:48.533 --> 57:50.435
They'd never build something
like this without a back door,

57:50.535 --> 57:52.771
- in case it collapsed, right?
- Never.

57:52.871 --> 57:56.408
Never. There's gotta be something else.
Look around. Everybody look around.

57:56.508 --> 57:58.341
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know.

58:02.047 --> 58:03.846
Is there anything?

58:06.051 --> 58:07.784
Some bones.

58:08.453 --> 58:11.974
- What is that? Is that something?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

58:12.075 --> 58:14.957
- George! George!
- What is it?

58:17.128 --> 58:22.033
It's the <i>Porta Alchemica.</i>
This is the door to the mystical!

58:22.133 --> 58:24.202
Wait. This is a door? That's a door?

58:24.302 --> 58:26.969
No, not exactly. It works
in conjunction with this.

58:27.105 --> 58:28.538
Here.

58:30.408 --> 58:34.279
This is "As above, so below."

58:34.379 --> 58:37.983
That phrase is believed
to be the key to all magic.

58:38.083 --> 58:39.716
It means that...

58:40.819 --> 58:43.889
what is within me is outside of me.

58:43.989 --> 58:49.160
As it is on Earth, so it is in heaven.
As I am, so are my cells,

58:49.260 --> 58:52.664
so are my atoms, so is God.

58:52.764 --> 58:54.933
Basically,

58:55.433 --> 58:58.534
as I believe the world
to be, so it is.

58:59.137 --> 59:00.403
I'm not following.

59:00.905 --> 59:03.808
As above, so below.

59:03.908 --> 59:07.212
So if they carved a
door on the ceiling...

59:07.312 --> 59:09.014
There has got to be a
door on the floor, too.

59:09.114 --> 59:11.216
- Yeah. Someone hand me a rock.
- All right.

59:11.316 --> 59:14.219
Wait. We are in the
bottom of the catacombs.

59:14.319 --> 59:16.252
There's nothing below us, Scarlett.

59:17.589 --> 59:19.255
Shit.

59:21.359 --> 59:24.861
If this is the floor then where
is all that water going?

59:30.268 --> 59:31.667
There's a way out.

59:42.781 --> 59:44.981
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

59:47.352 --> 59:49.254
Guys, there's a passage down here.

59:49.354 --> 59:52.688
- Come down. It's okay.
- Souxie.

59:55.627 --> 59:57.226
Watch out, Benji.

59:58.363 --> 01:00:01.931
Can you read that? What does it say?

01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:12.241
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here."

01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:15.478
What?

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:24.353
According to mythology, that's the
inscription over the gates of Hell.

01:00:25.223 --> 01:00:26.389
What?

01:00:28.359 --> 01:00:30.061
I'm not going in there.

01:00:30.161 --> 01:00:32.895
I thought you didn't
believe in any of this.

01:00:34.199 --> 01:00:35.765
I don't.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.810
"And they shall be made to crawl on their
bellies to enter the kingdom of darkness."

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:48.246
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

01:00:48.346 --> 01:00:49.612
Yeah.

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:52.915
Shit.

01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:09.599
Fuck.

01:01:15.373 --> 01:01:16.841
It's exactly the same.

01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:21.511
No. No, it's not.
It's not exactly the same.

01:01:23.214 --> 01:01:25.781
Everything's the wrong way around.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.620
This is upside down.

01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:35.226
Wait. No!

01:01:35.326 --> 01:01:36.559
What?

01:01:36.795 --> 01:01:38.127
No.

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:43.065
- What the fuck?
- What happened to the entrance?

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.403
Jesus.

01:01:48.673 --> 01:01:50.806
Are we dead?

01:01:51.409 --> 01:01:54.610
No. We're not dead.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:59.682
We should just keep moving.

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:01.653
Okay?

01:02:01.753 --> 01:02:04.487
We have to find a way out. Come on.

01:02:06.858 --> 01:02:08.958
Shit. Okay.

01:02:14.132 --> 01:02:15.631
I go.

01:02:43.628 --> 01:02:45.196
- Souxie!
- Souxie!

01:02:45.296 --> 01:02:47.198
- Is everybody out?
- Yeah.

01:02:47.298 --> 01:02:48.700
I don't have a light.
Do you have a light?

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.232
I can't find my light, either.

01:02:52.971 --> 01:02:54.637
Do you see that?

01:02:55.006 --> 01:02:57.974
Get the camera.
Be careful. Careful!

01:02:59.344 --> 01:03:00.612
What is that?

01:03:00.712 --> 01:03:02.178
What is that?

01:03:05.984 --> 01:03:07.483
Jesus.

01:03:17.428 --> 01:03:18.694
Souxie.

01:03:19.764 --> 01:03:20.930
No.

01:03:29.841 --> 01:03:31.373
Souxie.

01:03:34.946 --> 01:03:37.213
- La Taupe?
- La Taupe!

01:03:43.388 --> 01:03:45.221
Are you okay?

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.363
- La Taupe?
- What the fuck?

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:53.929
Shit!

01:03:54.532 --> 01:03:56.634
- Souxie, stay back!
- Stay back!

01:03:56.734 --> 01:03:59.368
Careful, Benji. Careful.

01:04:00.605 --> 01:04:03.205
- The fuck is wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:05.908
Hey.

01:04:08.146 --> 01:04:09.678
It's okay.

01:04:10.248 --> 01:04:11.649
- It's me.
- No, no, don't.

01:04:11.749 --> 01:04:14.050
- Okay? Hey.
- Souxie, be careful.

01:04:14.986 --> 01:04:17.388
- La Taupe.
- Souxie, don't.

01:04:17.488 --> 01:04:18.721
His eyes.

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:20.256
Hey.

01:04:25.797 --> 01:04:28.366
- Souxie!
- Souxie, no!

01:04:28.466 --> 01:04:31.002
Benji! Get a light on La Taupe!

01:04:31.102 --> 01:04:32.904
Benji! He's over here!

01:04:33.004 --> 01:04:34.639
- Where is he?
- Hold her head.

01:04:34.739 --> 01:04:37.773
- Where is he?
- Where the fuck did he go?

01:04:39.177 --> 01:04:41.479
The stone! Bring her back, please!

01:04:41.579 --> 01:04:43.481
- It won't work.
- Fix her! It will fix her!

01:04:43.581 --> 01:04:45.183
Please try! Try it! Please!

01:04:45.283 --> 01:04:46.417
I'm trying. I'm sorry.

01:04:46.517 --> 01:04:48.517
Fix her. Fix her.

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.991
It can't bring back the dead.
I'm sorry.

01:04:57.595 --> 01:05:00.596
- I'm sorry.
- Is she dead?

01:05:04.969 --> 01:05:07.169
I'm so sorry, man.

01:05:22.787 --> 01:05:24.787
I'm so sorry.

01:05:25.556 --> 01:05:27.556
We have to keep moving.

01:05:28.626 --> 01:05:30.292
Okay?

01:05:31.562 --> 01:05:33.629
- George, you follow me.
- Yeah.

01:05:34.832 --> 01:05:38.134
- Okay. I'm right behind you.
- Okay.

01:05:44.008 --> 01:05:46.642
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:54.052 --> 01:05:56.185
<i>- Scarlett.</i>
- What?

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:00.156
What?

01:06:10.568 --> 01:06:14.839
Everything is like the mirror image
of what we have already done,

01:06:14.939 --> 01:06:18.107
but somehow, we keep going deeper.

01:06:18.676 --> 01:06:20.576
How much deeper?

01:06:21.179 --> 01:06:23.579
Another 100 meters.

01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:28.517
Putting us... 1,000 feet down.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.359
Did you hear that?

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:40.229
<i>Scarlett!</i>

01:06:41.632 --> 01:06:44.869
- Is that Benji?
- No, I don't think so.

01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:46.137
Benji?

01:06:46.237 --> 01:06:48.773
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, you?

01:06:48.873 --> 01:06:51.707
- Good!
- All right. Good.

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:08.991
Is somebody there?

01:07:19.971 --> 01:07:21.536
Hello?

01:07:26.177 --> 01:07:27.343
George.

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.182
Benji! Benji!

01:07:31.282 --> 01:07:34.052
- Benji! Benji.
- Benji! Oh, my God.

01:07:34.152 --> 01:07:37.422
Get him over! Get him over! Get him over!
Get him over! Is he alive? Is he alive?

01:07:37.522 --> 01:07:39.188
- No, no, no!
- Shit!

01:07:41.025 --> 01:07:43.659
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:48.366 --> 01:07:51.033
- We should keep moving.
- Benji.

01:07:54.272 --> 01:07:56.138
We should keep moving.

01:07:56.974 --> 01:07:58.743
- Come on.
- Let's go!

01:07:58.843 --> 01:08:03.114
We need light. We gotta go.
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

01:08:03.214 --> 01:08:04.549
Scarlett, we gotta go.

01:08:04.649 --> 01:08:06.716
Oh, my God!

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.521
Let's go.

01:08:10.621 --> 01:08:12.655
Oh, my God!

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:22.464
George, help me.

01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:39.180
- Danny?
- George, help me.

01:08:39.884 --> 01:08:42.286
- Danny! Danny!
- George?

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:43.988
Wait. Move the bones!

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:45.590
Move the bones! Danny!

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:48.658
- George!
- Danny!

01:08:48.759 --> 01:08:51.929
That's my brother down there!
Get off the bones! Get off the bones!

01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:55.466
Danny! Danny! Move the bones!
Get out of the way!

01:08:55.566 --> 01:08:59.937
I said, get the fuck out of the way!
Danny! Danny!

01:09:00.037 --> 01:09:04.773
It's not real. George!
It's not real! George!

01:09:07.178 --> 01:09:08.344
George.

01:09:19.423 --> 01:09:20.589
We have to go.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.470
Scarlett, why would he be here?

01:09:33.571 --> 01:09:36.738
- I don't know.
- What is happening to us?

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:47.750
Wait.

01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:05.027
No. It wasn't my fault.

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:08.163
It wasn't my fault!

01:11:17.408 --> 01:11:20.075
Help me! Help me!

01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:33.856
Get his leg!

01:11:42.933 --> 01:11:46.170
No! No! We have to go
back to get Papillon!

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:50.772
- No. Absolutely not. Come on!
- What is that?

01:11:54.745 --> 01:11:56.447
What was that? What did you hear?

01:11:56.547 --> 01:11:59.617
- George, let's go back. Let's go back.
- Hey.

01:11:59.717 --> 01:12:00.985
No, Zed.

01:12:01.085 --> 01:12:02.753
- Keep with us.
- We can't.

01:12:02.853 --> 01:12:05.456
- We can't go back.
- We have to keep going.

01:12:05.556 --> 01:12:07.856
Come on. Come on.

01:12:32.917 --> 01:12:35.450
Okay. Go. Go, go, go.

01:13:01.546 --> 01:13:03.445
What the fuck was that?

01:13:13.023 --> 01:13:14.456
Fuck.

01:13:17.194 --> 01:13:19.695
Scarlett, Scarlett.

01:13:20.931 --> 01:13:22.900
Whatever happens,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.102
the week in Turkey was the
greatest week of my life.

01:13:28.372 --> 01:13:29.972
Mine, too.

01:13:34.979 --> 01:13:36.712
We gotta go.

01:13:38.215 --> 01:13:40.048
We gotta go.

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:43.754
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:13:43.854 --> 01:13:44.855
- Zed?
- Yeah?

01:13:44.955 --> 01:13:47.289
- Are you with me?
- Yeah, man.

01:13:50.861 --> 01:13:52.194
Okay.

01:13:53.297 --> 01:13:54.896
Wait. Wait.

01:14:59.797 --> 01:15:03.098
Shit. Shit. He's getting up.

01:15:04.868 --> 01:15:06.435
Go, go, go!

01:15:18.616 --> 01:15:19.781
Zed.

01:15:30.127 --> 01:15:31.393
Get back. Get back.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.073
Hang on!

01:15:50.447 --> 01:15:52.914
Shit! Go, go, go!

01:16:04.328 --> 01:16:05.761
Hold on!

01:16:06.463 --> 01:16:08.530
He's losing blood!

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:12.300
Zed, put your hand here!
Just keep it down!

01:16:13.971 --> 01:16:15.706
Zed! Put your hand there.

01:16:15.806 --> 01:16:17.875
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's okay.

01:16:17.975 --> 01:16:19.710
Hold on. Okay?

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.079
Not yet. Hold on. Okay. Okay.

01:16:22.179 --> 01:16:25.680
It's okay. It's okay.
Hold on. Hold on.

01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:30.418
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Okay.

01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:35.960
It's not working. It's not working.

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.261
- Why?
- I don't know!

01:16:37.361 --> 01:16:39.794
It's not working! Oh, my God.

01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:43.300
- VITRIOL.
- What?

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.069
VITRIOL.

01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:47.035
VITRIOL.

01:16:48.072 --> 01:16:50.040
Yeah.

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.408
"Visit the interior
parts of the Earth,

01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:54.342
by rectification thou shalt
find the hidden stone."

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:59.149
"By rectification thou shalt
find the hidden stone."

01:16:59.249 --> 01:17:00.982
Hidden stone.

01:17:01.318 --> 01:17:03.721
Rectification.

01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:07.257
George, the hidden stone.
This isn't the right stone.

01:17:07.357 --> 01:17:10.127
I have to rectify the taking of it.

01:17:10.227 --> 01:17:12.360
Only by putting it back
will I find the real stone.

01:17:14.231 --> 01:17:15.831
Fuck!

01:17:16.734 --> 01:17:17.935
Fuck!

01:17:18.035 --> 01:17:19.236
What?

01:17:19.336 --> 01:17:20.304
I'm going back.

01:17:20.404 --> 01:17:22.439
- No, you can't!
- I have to go back.

01:17:22.539 --> 01:17:24.675
By the time we get him
out of here he'll be dead!

01:17:24.775 --> 01:17:27.645
- Please! Wait!
- Stay with him. I'll be back.

01:17:27.745 --> 01:17:31.482
Just keep him safe. I'm coming back!
Hold on! Hold on!

01:17:31.582 --> 01:17:33.849
- I'm coming back!
- Scarlett!

01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:36.585
Scarlett!

01:18:09.386 --> 01:18:12.122
You can do this. You can do this.

01:19:24.394 --> 01:19:25.961
Dad?

01:19:57.494 --> 01:20:00.862
"By rectification thou shalt
find the hidden stone."

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.336
Okay. I rectified.

01:20:06.436 --> 01:20:08.837
Where's the hidden stone?

01:20:22.786 --> 01:20:26.888
George. George,
do you hear me? George?

01:20:33.697 --> 01:20:37.632
Shut up. Come on. Come on, come on.

01:20:38.702 --> 01:20:41.538
As above, so below.

01:20:41.638 --> 01:20:44.441
As I believe the world
to be, so it is.

01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:46.207
Hold on, George.

01:20:56.586 --> 01:20:57.752
Dad.

01:21:04.728 --> 01:21:07.197
I'm sorry...

01:21:07.297 --> 01:21:11.299
that I didn't pick up
the phone that night.

01:21:14.571 --> 01:21:16.938
I didn't know you were
in that much pain.

01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:41.196
George?

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.277
Zed! Where are you?

01:21:53.377 --> 01:21:55.243
Scarlett! Here!

01:21:59.383 --> 01:22:02.450
- Did you find the stone?
- Yes! Okay.

01:22:16.566 --> 01:22:18.032
How did you do that?

01:22:19.503 --> 01:22:21.035
Hi.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.839
- George?
- George?

01:22:26.843 --> 01:22:28.143
Come here.

01:22:30.347 --> 01:22:32.783
Scarlett, Scarlett. Go, go.

01:22:32.883 --> 01:22:34.048
Give me your hand.

01:22:37.687 --> 01:22:39.087
Zed!

01:22:40.524 --> 01:22:42.824
Zed! Zed!

01:22:45.862 --> 01:22:47.464
Dead end!

01:22:47.564 --> 01:22:50.665
- Watch out!
- Shit, my lamp! Shit!

01:22:52.736 --> 01:22:53.935
Hurry!

01:22:57.374 --> 01:22:59.276
We will never be able
to climb down that.

01:22:59.376 --> 01:23:00.844
- We have to jump.
- What?

01:23:00.944 --> 01:23:03.947
We have to rectify ourselves

01:23:04.047 --> 01:23:07.250
- and jump.
- Scarlett, you're crazy. We will die.

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:10.253
No. George, listen. Why do you keep
seeing your brother down here?

01:23:10.353 --> 01:23:13.023
What is it about his
death that torments you?

01:23:13.123 --> 01:23:15.659
- George. George.
- It's not gonna work.

01:23:15.759 --> 01:23:19.763
- Why is he haunting you?
- When Danny got his leg pinned

01:23:19.863 --> 01:23:24.835
I promised him I'd be back with help.
But I got lost along the way.

01:23:24.935 --> 01:23:27.869
My brother drowned
waiting for me to save him.

01:23:29.406 --> 01:23:31.272
It's okay.

01:23:32.476 --> 01:23:33.977
Zed.

01:23:34.077 --> 01:23:38.980
I have a child I've never seen.
I know it's mine, but I deny it.

01:23:39.716 --> 01:23:41.952
It's okay. Give me your hand.

01:23:42.052 --> 01:23:44.488
- Scarlett, it's not gonna work.
- George.

01:23:44.588 --> 01:23:48.325
- I can't.
- I won't go without you. I won't.

01:23:48.425 --> 01:23:50.091
Okay. Okay.

01:23:51.661 --> 01:23:53.330
- We go on three.
- On three.

01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:55.029
One.

01:23:56.566 --> 01:23:58.166
Two.

01:24:00.837 --> 01:24:02.470
Three.

01:24:28.632 --> 01:24:30.097
Fuck!

01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:35.136
- Save the light.
- Yeah.

01:24:37.007 --> 01:24:39.807
- We are trapped?
- No.

01:24:41.611 --> 01:24:45.713
Fuck! Fuck! No! Fuck!

01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:48.085
Zed! Zed!

01:24:48.185 --> 01:24:49.718
We'll die!

01:24:50.353 --> 01:24:51.555
We'll die!

01:24:51.655 --> 01:24:54.989
Hey! Down. Put the light down.

01:24:55.725 --> 01:24:57.125
Help me get the rocks.

01:25:02.365 --> 01:25:07.402
It's a manhole. Find a grip. Find a grip.
Can you get your fingers in the sides?

01:25:08.171 --> 01:25:11.072
- Just try! Try!
- I'm trying!

01:25:12.242 --> 01:25:13.508
I can't.

01:25:15.312 --> 01:25:16.646
Scarlett, what did you just do?

01:25:16.746 --> 01:25:18.746
- Pushed it down.
- Okay. Okay.

01:25:19.583 --> 01:25:21.182
One, two, three.

01:25:22.352 --> 01:25:24.287
Oh, my God.

01:25:24.387 --> 01:25:26.089
We're gonna push it straight down.

01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:27.824
- Down and to the side.
- Okay.

01:25:27.924 --> 01:25:30.825
One, two, three.

01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:36.197
Good, good, good. Get it over here.

01:25:51.681 --> 01:25:53.483
Holy shit!

01:25:53.583 --> 01:25:54.882
Zed.

01:25:55.118 --> 01:25:57.018
Hello?

01:25:59.089 --> 01:26:02.757
We gotta get out. Get the camera out.

01:27:28.278 --> 01:27:32.156
People say that I'm some
kind of treasure hunter.

01:27:32.257 --> 01:27:37.387
It's not what I'm after. I'm not
doing this for financial gain.

01:27:37.487 --> 01:27:41.656
I'm a student.
Of history, of alchemy.

01:27:42.459 --> 01:27:44.694
It would be...

01:27:44.794 --> 01:27:48.064
of great historical value.

01:27:48.164 --> 01:27:51.999
- So you simply want the truth.
- Exactly.

01:27:54.537 --> 01:27:57.338
Yeah, I want the truth.

01:32:12.962 --> 01:32:16.630
<i>The only way out is down.</i>
