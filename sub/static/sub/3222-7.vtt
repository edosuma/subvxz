00:04.514 --> 00:06.175
<i>- Hi, Amy.
- You know me.</i>

00:06.349 --> 00:08.340
<i>You know the kind of
person I am.</i>

00:08.551 --> 00:10.542
She's dropping bodies, man,
which means we gotta drop her.

00:10.787 --> 00:12.186
She's done. Trust me.

00:12.388 --> 00:13.548
Okay.

00:13.790 --> 00:16.020
You are what you are.
You will kill again.

00:16.192 --> 00:17.887
What's going on with you?

00:18.094 --> 00:19.584
<i>You are what you are.</i>

00:20.663 --> 00:22.858
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Whatever you're not telling me about!

00:23.032 --> 00:24.693
I know you didn't wanna let her go.

00:24.867 --> 00:26.300
But it was the right thing to do.
So thanks.

00:26.502 --> 00:27.662
No problem.

00:27.870 --> 00:30.737
- You know my motto, here to help.
- Like you helped Amy?

00:30.940 --> 00:32.100
I'm sorry.

00:33.309 --> 00:35.209
You should just go on without me.

00:37.547 --> 00:39.242
All right.

00:48.891 --> 00:52.691
Yes, a spirit has gathered around us.

00:54.397 --> 00:56.388
Are you with us, spirit?

01:04.540 --> 01:09.603
I feel something.
I have goose bumps. Uncle Danny?

01:09.846 --> 01:11.473
We're going to make contact now.

01:11.714 --> 01:14.808
Rest your hands on the planchette.

01:14.984 --> 01:18.852
Let the spirit guide our hands.

01:20.490 --> 01:25.951
O Spirit, are you the one we seek?

01:26.129 --> 01:29.963
Are you Uncle Danny?

01:33.069 --> 01:34.593
I'm not doing that.

01:35.171 --> 01:36.763
Yeah. She's pushing it.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.475
It's okay to be skeptical.

01:43.880 --> 01:50.115
Danny, if you're with us,
knock twice for yes.

01:53.289 --> 01:57.658
Danny. Can you ask him,
is he happy?

02:00.696 --> 02:03.529
- He is. He's happy.
- Is Sadie with him?

02:03.699 --> 02:06.463
You're being ridiculous, Cynthia.
Who cares about Sadie?

02:06.636 --> 02:12.597
Uh. Yes. I see, a family pet.

02:12.809 --> 02:14.709
That's her,
Sadie was a Schnauzer.

02:14.944 --> 02:19.210
She is with Danny,
chasing tennis balls in the afterlife.

02:19.448 --> 02:21.780
Sadie loved tennis balls.

02:21.951 --> 02:24.511
There were important papers.
No one can find them.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.450
They weren't in the safe,
can you just ask him...?

02:27.657 --> 02:28.681
Of course.

02:29.725 --> 02:33.718
I'll need you to place
your hands with me on the planchette.

02:41.470 --> 02:44.234
Maybe... Maybe Danny
didn't like the question.

02:44.473 --> 02:47.306
Tell him to quit fooling around,
he knows that's my money.

02:52.715 --> 02:56.515
Can't you two stop squabbling?
For Pete's sake, he's dead.

02:57.954 --> 03:01.856
Tell him we're sorry.
Maybe if we're nice, he'Il...

03:04.260 --> 03:06.455
Oh, my God. Danny?

03:13.069 --> 03:14.468
What's going on?

04:05.621 --> 04:08.021
Jeez. Have some pride.

04:14.330 --> 04:16.264
<i>- Yeah.
- Makes me hungry.</i>

04:16.464 --> 04:19.593
<i>You're listening to Morning Chaos
with me, Bananas Foster.</i>

04:19.769 --> 04:22.237
<i>- The hell I am, asshat.
- And now news of the weird.</i>

04:22.405 --> 04:24.635
<i>Two very odd murders to be exact.</i>

04:24.807 --> 04:28.903
<i>Mediums are dying in Lily Dale,
the most psychic town in America.</i>

04:29.078 --> 04:31.979
<i>So if you wanna know your future,
stick to that 900 line...</i>

04:32.148 --> 04:34.776
<i>...because, is it me, or should
those guys have seen it coming?</i>

04:34.951 --> 04:37.476
<i>Ah-whoo!</i>

05:27.203 --> 05:31.196
Oh, Spirits of the Further.
Am I going to win the Powerball?

05:32.475 --> 05:33.703
I'm gonna be rich.

06:20.256 --> 06:22.087
Hello.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.690
First time at Good Graces?

06:24.527 --> 06:26.757
- Yes.
- We're 100 percent locally sourced...

06:26.929 --> 06:30.228
...biodynamic, and you get a free
affirmation with every order.

06:33.169 --> 06:38.072
- Think I'll source the taco joint.
- Just a coffee, black, uh, extra shot.

06:42.545 --> 06:44.410
You wear a suit
to get your palm read?

06:46.615 --> 06:49.413
Yeah. Not surprised
you caught this one.

06:49.585 --> 06:53.282
It's on every morning zoo
in America. You mind?

06:53.989 --> 06:56.719
So I, uh, went to the scene.

06:56.892 --> 06:59.258
Wires, speakers, enough EMF
to make your hair stand up.

06:59.428 --> 07:01.191
Don't think
about getting a reading.

07:01.397 --> 07:04.992
Oh, and, uh, if this hadn't have
been two psychics that bit it...

07:05.201 --> 07:08.659
...I would've just chalked this up
as being, uh, dumb and accidental.

07:08.838 --> 07:12.001
And I know, I know, whole town's
supposedly calling ghosts.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.972
But that takes some serious
spell work and serious mojo.

07:15.211 --> 07:17.475
The only books this lady had
were Oprah crap.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.206
When's the last time you
actually saw a real psychic?

07:20.416 --> 07:22.748
Huh? Pamela? Missouri?

07:22.952 --> 07:25.512
Anyway, this is good.
Um, how you been?

07:26.789 --> 07:28.154
And what can I get for you?

07:28.324 --> 07:29.484
Uh...

07:29.658 --> 07:32.718
- Pancakes, side of pig. Coffee black.
- Fantastic.

07:32.928 --> 07:35.954
You are a virile
manifestation of the divine.

07:39.101 --> 07:40.159
What did he say to me?

07:41.937 --> 07:45.805
It's funny? Yeah, no, go ahead.
Laugh it up, Sam. Hilarious.

07:50.946 --> 07:52.277
- Dean.
- Oh, he speaks.

07:54.884 --> 07:56.044
- Look...
- Sam...

07:58.254 --> 08:00.950
We're both here.
The chance either one of us leaving...

08:01.157 --> 08:02.488
...while people are still dying out there:

08:04.360 --> 08:07.227
Might as well bite the bullet
and work with me on this one.

08:07.396 --> 08:09.864
- I don't know if I can.
- I'm not asking to open a can of worms.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.159
I'm not asking you where
you been the past week.

08:12.368 --> 08:13.699
Good.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.398
I'm just saying let's try
and stop the killings. That's it.

08:21.677 --> 08:25.511
- Okay.
- Okay? Good.

08:28.651 --> 08:31.643
- Can I help you?
- You're the brothers, from the...

08:31.820 --> 08:35.221
The Winchester guys on the news a
couple weeks back? We get that a lot.

08:35.424 --> 08:38.552
Those depraved killers got put down
like the dogs that they were.

08:38.794 --> 08:42.160
Yeah. Us on the other hand,
we're completely harmless.

08:42.731 --> 08:46.861
Ha, ha, oh, yeah, I'm sorry, silly me.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.503
I can see by your energies
you're completely gentle.

08:49.705 --> 08:51.764
- NIKOLAl: Excuse my friend, heh.
- Niky.

08:51.941 --> 08:53.568
- She's excitable.
- Heh.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.178
Sweetheart, look at them. Hmm?
They're FBI.

08:57.346 --> 08:58.370
Oh.

08:58.547 --> 09:00.538
I'm Russian.
We can spot the law.

09:02.051 --> 09:04.019
You must be here about the tragedies.

09:04.220 --> 09:07.018
Oh, we're just beside ourselves
about what happened.

09:07.223 --> 09:10.056
- Yeah. So close to festival season, huh?
- Yeah. No.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.820
Of course we are worried,
we have no idea what's going on, huh?

09:14.897 --> 09:18.196
Nikolai. Let me know
if I can help you. I'm highly intuitive.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.927
- Nikolai Lishin, spoon bender?
- Hmm. World famous.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.470
Come to my demonstration
at the festival, huh?

09:28.444 --> 09:31.072
Teach you to harness
the power of your mind.

09:32.448 --> 09:34.848
Come, let's leave them be.

09:36.752 --> 09:39.448
So glad we decided to vacation here.

09:40.389 --> 09:42.880
All right. Ahem, here we go.

09:43.459 --> 09:45.950
First death. Second death.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.760
- What am I looking at?
- Well, see this?

09:49.932 --> 09:51.797
This is Imelda Graven.
Death number one.

09:52.001 --> 09:55.368
- Brained by her own crystal ball.
- Bummer and ironic, heh.

09:59.108 --> 10:01.975
- Same necklace?
- Imelda gave it to Goldy in her will.

10:02.177 --> 10:04.873
- Okay. So cursed object, maybe?
- Worth looking into.

10:05.581 --> 10:07.947
Goldy's next of kin lives in town.
Also a psychic.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.141
Oh, good. I haven't had my fill.

10:18.193 --> 10:19.888
He broke my spoon.

10:31.206 --> 10:32.969
Melanie Golden?

10:33.175 --> 10:36.008
Hi. Uh, got a minute?

10:38.547 --> 10:40.777
- You want me to stay?
- No, that's okay.

10:40.983 --> 10:42.348
Okay.

10:43.319 --> 10:45.014
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Of course.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.682
A friend. Just heard
about my grandmother.

10:52.061 --> 10:55.326
Which is, I guess,
why you guys are here. So come on in.

10:57.966 --> 10:59.991
Sorry. Just got back.

11:00.169 --> 11:02.228
- You were out of town?
- I work the circuit.

11:02.438 --> 11:04.633
Hotels, conventions, you know.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.168
Oh.

11:06.342 --> 11:09.334
No offense,
but, uh, you don't seem all that psychic.

11:10.479 --> 11:12.743
- Why do you say that?
- Well, I mean, you know...

11:12.948 --> 11:15.815
...where's all the, uh, crystals
and pyramids?

11:16.018 --> 11:17.679
I'm off the clock.

11:18.887 --> 11:23.017
Also, not psychic.
What? It's an honest living.

11:23.225 --> 11:27.184
- Interesting definition of honest.
- Well, I honestly read people.

11:27.363 --> 11:31.527
It's just less woo-woo,
more body language. Like you two.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.760
Longtime partners.
But, um, a lot of tension.

11:35.003 --> 11:38.370
You're pissed.
And you're stressed.

11:39.274 --> 11:41.174
It's not brain surgery.

11:41.343 --> 11:43.402
It's why my grandma
and me didn't get along.

11:43.579 --> 11:45.444
She'd go full smoke machine, heh...

11:45.614 --> 11:48.412
...but she actually believed
in all that stuff. So...

11:48.617 --> 11:51.085
- You don't.
- You do?

11:51.286 --> 11:55.279
I've got an open mind.
You'd be surprised.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.186
Hmm.

12:00.229 --> 12:02.857
I'm sorry, but there's
a necklace of your grandmother's...

12:03.065 --> 12:05.192
Everything went
straight to the Emporium.

12:05.401 --> 12:07.631
- She had a deal with the owner.
- The Emporium?

12:14.443 --> 12:16.502
You're looking for something.

12:16.712 --> 12:17.872
You're good.

12:18.046 --> 12:20.037
- You Jimmy Tomorrow?
- Mm-hm.

12:20.215 --> 12:22.445
- We're looking for a necklace.
- Oh. Romantic.

12:23.419 --> 12:25.717
It would've come
with Grandma Goldy's effects.

12:27.389 --> 12:31.792
Yes, yes, you do know
that this is the Orb of Thessaly.

12:32.528 --> 12:34.018
We did not know.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.831
Very powerful, very rare.

12:39.034 --> 12:40.433
Let me guess. Very expensive.

12:41.537 --> 12:42.970
Worth every penny.

12:43.906 --> 12:48.172
Well, in that case, we'll be taking
the State's Evidence discount.

12:49.745 --> 12:51.838
- What's going on?
- A murder investigation...

12:52.047 --> 12:54.481
...that we'd like to thank you
for not obstructing.

12:54.683 --> 12:57.277
You know, I give private
energetic readings.

12:58.353 --> 13:02.312
- No, thanks.
- A loss weighs on you, you're angry.

13:03.692 --> 13:07.128
It's complicated.
Come see me, agent.

13:16.205 --> 13:17.797
Thanks, Jimmy, we'll see.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.997
Bureau's gonna reimburse me
for the necklace?

13:20.209 --> 13:21.767
We'll send you a check.

13:23.212 --> 13:24.270
Right.

13:28.650 --> 13:30.982
<i>Went a little Mentalist on you there,
didn't he?</i>

13:31.887 --> 13:34.720
All right. Next question.
What's an Orb of Thessaly?

13:34.890 --> 13:37.950
I know one thing.
It's made in Taiwan.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.988
Oh, a fake, around here. Imagine that.

13:41.163 --> 13:44.223
Of course, that means that, uh,
whatever's killing mediums...

13:44.399 --> 13:45.866
...is still out there.

14:39.755 --> 14:42.223
No, no!

15:01.076 --> 15:03.977
Probably should've bent those
with the power of his mind.

15:05.647 --> 15:08.878
- Chief. We met at the station.
- Right. Morning, agent.

15:09.084 --> 15:13.043
Morning. Uh, this is Agent Borne.
So, what happened?

15:13.288 --> 15:16.189
It's a weird one.
Chest full of cutlery.

15:17.826 --> 15:20.090
Uh, we're gonna look around,
let us know if you got any leads.

15:20.329 --> 15:25.562
I got leads coming out of my ass.
As of 9:00, our tip line had 46 calls.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.827
All from clairvoyants
that know what really happened.

15:29.004 --> 15:31.768
- What's the popular theory?
- It's a toss up...

15:31.940 --> 15:34.841
...between a ghost and some
ogre that only attacks Russians.

15:36.078 --> 15:39.070
- Policing Lily Dale sounds fun.
- It was this or Los Angeles.

15:40.682 --> 15:44.243
So these clairvoyants,
did they give any details as to why...

15:44.419 --> 15:48.719
...they thought it was a ghost
or a Russian ogre?

15:48.924 --> 15:51.222
Their spirit monkey said so.

15:51.393 --> 15:54.794
Plus apparently this guy claims
he had a vision of his own death.

15:54.963 --> 15:56.021
Cutlery and all.

16:00.035 --> 16:01.332
Excuse me.

16:04.206 --> 16:08.074
- Hello?
- Agent Borne? It's Melanie Golden.

16:08.276 --> 16:10.574
- Everything okay?
- You mean it when you said...

16:10.746 --> 16:12.839
...you had an open mind?

16:14.616 --> 16:16.208
I hadn't checked it until today.

16:16.385 --> 16:18.717
The only person who called
my landline was my grandma.

16:18.920 --> 16:22.287
- It's okay. Go on.
- Look, I wouldn't put any stock in it.

16:22.457 --> 16:25.085
She was always calling me
with some crazy dream...

16:25.260 --> 16:28.058
...she was sure was a sign,
that kind of thing.

16:28.263 --> 16:32.165
But, uh, is it true Nikolai had
a real vision of his death?

16:32.401 --> 16:33.800
That's what we were told.

16:35.003 --> 16:38.495
- Well, so did she. The day she died.
- What'd she say?

16:38.740 --> 16:42.608
Well, you can listen to it if you want.
She said she was in a séance...

16:42.778 --> 16:44.609
...um, then the lights go, it's freezing.

16:44.813 --> 16:47.008
Wait, she said that?
That the room got cold?

16:47.182 --> 16:49.650
Yeah. Why, is that important?

16:50.585 --> 16:52.485
What? What is it?

16:52.654 --> 16:57.614
- A ghost. The real deal.
- Come on.

17:00.028 --> 17:01.188
You're serious.

17:01.430 --> 17:06.663
See, there's, uh, fake woo-woo crap,
and there's real woo-woo crap.

17:06.902 --> 17:10.429
Well, yeah, but ghosts?

17:10.638 --> 17:13.335
Trust me, there's a lot
weirder out there than that.

17:13.508 --> 17:18.137
<i>So, um, the X-Files is real or you
just stopped talking like an FBI agent.</i>

17:18.313 --> 17:22.146
Well, um, we're not FBI agents.

17:25.987 --> 17:27.954
- I need a drink.
- I support that.

17:32.994 --> 17:36.122
If this is a spirit, it ain't your
average spook-tied-to-a-house.

17:36.298 --> 17:39.495
- This thing is boogying all over town.
- I'm not surprised.

17:39.668 --> 17:43.229
How many crystal balls
are in Lily Dale?

17:44.139 --> 17:45.299
Somewhere between 50...

17:45.474 --> 17:47.305
...and, uh, all of them.

17:47.709 --> 17:51.406
Well, I mean, quartz can act
as an antenna for spirits, right?

17:51.580 --> 17:54.140
That's why mediums started
using crystal balls.

17:54.349 --> 17:58.649
That means that every storefront
in town's got a ghost satellite dish.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.880
Exactly. And this place is packed
with people summoning spirits.

18:02.090 --> 18:04.081
Most of these guys
can't even call a taxi.

18:04.326 --> 18:05.884
All it takes is one.

18:06.061 --> 18:08.928
That's like looking for a needle
in a stack of fake needles.

18:09.097 --> 18:12.225
It's worse. I'll bet you
some of these guys got real juice.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.197
I'm not talking kill-people level...

18:14.402 --> 18:16.597
...I'm saying enough
to make it complicated.

18:16.772 --> 18:21.209
I hate this town. All right, so, what,
start hitting up the Miss Cleos?

18:21.376 --> 18:24.709
I was thinking, split up and canvass.
It's faster.

18:27.582 --> 18:29.174
Right. Course you were.

18:41.129 --> 18:43.620
What is it? My brother?

18:43.865 --> 18:45.230
Is he going back to prison?

18:45.400 --> 18:51.635
Stay away,
his curse will drag you down.

18:51.873 --> 18:56.742
Folks do turn jail into a habit,
you know.

18:58.547 --> 18:59.571
Oh, oh, oh.

18:59.748 --> 19:02.308
No, no, don't fret.

19:03.318 --> 19:08.153
I always say,
family is a pain in the ass anyhow.

19:10.158 --> 19:13.093
Thank you, Sister Thibideaux.

19:13.261 --> 19:18.563
No, child, thank the spirits.

19:21.136 --> 19:22.967
Now, will that be cash or credit?

19:45.594 --> 19:48.427
It's okay. Like I said on the phone,
he can help.

19:48.630 --> 19:51.428
Phony lawman, huh?

19:51.600 --> 19:54.091
Yeah, because nobody
can relate to phony around here.

19:54.269 --> 19:58.296
Well, if you can do something,
I don't care if you call yourself the pope.

19:58.473 --> 19:59.997
What happened, exactly?

20:00.175 --> 20:04.703
What happened is I had a frigging
vision. Something is coming for me.

20:04.946 --> 20:06.208
What's coming?
Did you get a look?

20:06.448 --> 20:10.282
No. But I sure felt it when it
started breaking my bones.

20:13.154 --> 20:15.588
- I don't wanna die.
- Okay. We'll figure it out.

20:15.790 --> 20:17.382
Vision happened in here?

20:18.493 --> 20:20.825
Yeah, by the cash box.

20:37.012 --> 20:39.037
There any chance
good looking was watching?

20:47.656 --> 20:49.180
What was that?

20:54.396 --> 20:55.727
What the hell?

20:56.498 --> 20:58.329
Oh, my God.

20:58.867 --> 20:59.925
Oh, my God.

21:00.235 --> 21:01.497
Was that? An actual?

21:01.736 --> 21:02.862
Bona fide. Yeah.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.032
No offense, but nobody's
having psychic visions around here.

21:08.343 --> 21:11.676
This, uh, spirit, whoever she is,
is giving them out.

21:12.180 --> 21:14.011
And then killing people?

21:14.916 --> 21:15.940
Until we stop her.

21:17.018 --> 21:19.646
Good news, you said you saw
a clock, and it read 2 a.m.

21:19.854 --> 21:21.287
That gives us a little time.

21:22.023 --> 21:25.083
Now, does anybody
recognize this chick?

21:25.927 --> 21:27.360
I swear I've seen her.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.425
Like in a painting or something.

21:29.698 --> 21:31.962
- A painting? Uh...
- No, not a painting.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.658
In one of those old photos
in the museum.

21:40.408 --> 21:42.205
<i>Lily Dale has long been a haven...</i>

21:42.444 --> 21:43.911
...for the psychically gifted.

21:44.312 --> 21:47.042
Tortured elsewhere,
they're embraced here.

21:47.482 --> 21:49.382
My own family has a modest...

21:49.617 --> 21:52.882
...natural gift.
We also celebrate our...

21:53.121 --> 21:55.954
...long and colorful history of...

21:56.925 --> 21:58.256
...embellishers.

21:59.761 --> 22:00.989
Ectoplasm illusion...

22:01.262 --> 22:03.958
...circa 1890.

22:07.969 --> 22:12.599
We're walking. We're walking.
Now, as you may know, ectoplasm...

22:25.320 --> 22:27.481
Never ended well for the siblings.

22:28.490 --> 22:31.857
- Why's that?
- Hm, the strain of working together.

22:32.027 --> 22:34.860
Or maybe just being around each other
all their lives.

22:36.431 --> 22:39.093
Those two were the exception,
actually, the Campbells...

22:39.334 --> 22:40.528
...got along famously.

22:40.935 --> 22:43.768
That was just a stage name.
They weren't actually brothers.

22:45.673 --> 22:49.837
That was a cover
for their, uh, alternative lifestyle.

22:51.980 --> 22:54.244
- Any other questions I can answer?
- Yes, uh...

22:54.816 --> 22:57.649
- Who were they?
- Oh, the Fox sisters.

22:57.819 --> 22:59.480
Among the founders of Lily Dale.

22:59.754 --> 23:01.881
Kate Fox. Quite troubled...

23:02.157 --> 23:06.491
...apparently, but mesmerizing on-stage.
She's said to be able to...

23:06.761 --> 23:07.819
...levitate objects...

23:08.063 --> 23:11.328
...and foretell one's death.
That's her.

23:11.566 --> 23:15.525
Her older sister, Margaret,
perhaps not a natural psychic.

23:15.870 --> 23:16.894
So full of crap.

23:17.138 --> 23:20.073
Yes, well. She didn't have
her sister's charisma...

23:20.842 --> 23:23.037
...but she looked after Kate.

23:24.145 --> 23:27.342
Sometimes one's true gift
is taking care of others.

23:30.018 --> 23:31.883
- What happened to them?
- Lived here all their lives.

23:32.487 --> 23:37.083
- Lived here and died here?
- Yes, well, buried in the cemetery.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.187
Great. That was, uh, very educational.

23:40.428 --> 23:42.726
Thank you. Dean.

23:45.667 --> 23:48.363
I'm sorry, I don't normally do this
during business hours...

23:48.536 --> 23:52.870
...but do you know
an Eleanor or an Ellen?

23:55.009 --> 23:57.443
She seems quite concerned about you.

23:58.213 --> 24:00.044
She wants to tell you...

24:00.915 --> 24:05.579
...pardon me, if you don't tell someone
how bad it really is...

24:05.753 --> 24:07.516
...she'll kick your ass from beyond.

24:08.389 --> 24:11.222
You have to trust someone
again eventually.

24:14.429 --> 24:19.264
Heh, anyway,
don't forget to visit the gift shop.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.970
All right, hit the graveyard,
dig up Kate.

24:28.143 --> 24:30.338
- Wait a second.
- All signs point to her, Dean.

24:30.545 --> 24:33.241
No, just hold on a damn minute.

24:34.048 --> 24:36.812
- Enough with just the facts.
- We agreed...

24:36.985 --> 24:38.418
We agreed to work the case,
we didn't agree for you to be a dick...

24:38.720 --> 24:40.278
...the whole time.
What?

24:41.956 --> 24:43.355
You're pissed, okay?

24:43.558 --> 24:44.923
- You got a right.
- Damn straight.

24:45.093 --> 24:46.924
- But enough's enough.
- Says who?

24:47.162 --> 24:50.290
Look, I'll work this damn case,
but you lied to me...

24:51.666 --> 24:53.861
...and you killed my friend.

24:54.402 --> 24:57.565
No, I put down a monster
who killed four people.

24:57.739 --> 24:58.763
If you didn't know her...

24:58.940 --> 25:00.237
...you'd have done the same...
I did know her.

25:00.408 --> 25:02.273
Which is why you couldn't do it.

25:03.011 --> 25:04.103
Look, I get it.

25:04.379 --> 25:06.643
There are certain people,
no matter how dangerous they are...

25:06.915 --> 25:09.509
...you just can't.
Don't pull that card, that's bull.

25:09.784 --> 25:11.149
If I've learned one thing...

25:11.653 --> 25:13.518
...it's that if something feels wrong,
it probably is.

25:13.788 --> 25:16.120
Usually, yeah.
But killing Amy was not wrong.

25:16.391 --> 25:20.191
You couldn't do it, so I did.
That's what family does. The dirty work.

25:20.461 --> 25:22.952
And I would've told you. Eventually.

25:23.131 --> 25:25.463
Once I knew that this whole
waving-a-gun-at-Satan thing...

25:25.667 --> 25:26.793
...was a one-time show.

25:27.035 --> 25:28.297
I think it's reasonable...

25:28.536 --> 25:30.470
...to wanna know that you're off
the high dive.

25:30.672 --> 25:33.436
You almost got us killed.
You can be pissed all you want.

25:33.641 --> 25:34.767
But quit being a bitch.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.792
I get why she's killing people.

26:01.502 --> 26:03.367
Just don't get why
she's warning them.

26:07.242 --> 26:09.073
Give them a taste of the curse, maybe?

26:11.079 --> 26:13.240
It couldn't have been ajoyride.

26:14.082 --> 26:15.208
Here we go.

26:21.522 --> 26:22.716
Sam!

26:22.890 --> 26:24.755
- Back off, crazy eyes.
- Listen to me...

26:25.093 --> 26:27.061
...why isn't anybody listening?

26:27.262 --> 26:29.093
- No.
- You don't get a vote.

26:29.330 --> 26:30.388
No, stop!

26:31.232 --> 26:36.067
No! No!

26:41.075 --> 26:42.099
Nice timing.

26:46.848 --> 26:49.043
Got it. And Dean? Thanks.

26:50.852 --> 26:52.342
- They took care of it.
- Heh.

26:54.989 --> 26:58.891
Okay. So, what, just go home?

27:00.028 --> 27:01.620
I guess.

27:04.232 --> 27:07.133
Hey, why don't you come stay with me
a couple days?

27:08.002 --> 27:09.026
Thanks.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.200
Just one more minute.

27:13.441 --> 27:15.534
- It's fine, hon.
- If you had that vision...

27:15.777 --> 27:17.642
...you wouldn't wanna be here either.

27:27.755 --> 27:29.279
It's okay, let's just go.

27:34.262 --> 27:35.786
What is it?

27:39.667 --> 27:41.066
Call them back. Now.

27:43.638 --> 27:45.663
- Melanie?
- Dean? You have to come back.

27:45.840 --> 27:46.966
What's going on?

27:47.342 --> 27:49.242
- It's still happening.
- What do you mean it's...?

27:49.410 --> 27:51.742
She's still coming.
Tell me what the hell to do.

27:51.946 --> 27:54.176
- Listen to me, calm down.
- Give me the phone and drive.

27:54.349 --> 27:57.614
- Melanie. Hey, get to the kitchen.
- Okay.

27:59.754 --> 28:01.119
- Aah!
- She's here!

28:01.289 --> 28:02.586
Just go. Get salt.

28:09.630 --> 28:11.564
It worked. She's gone!

28:13.701 --> 28:14.963
No, she's back!

28:16.504 --> 28:18.836
- Out of salt!
- Find iron. Is there a fireplace?

28:19.140 --> 28:20.573
Melanie!

28:32.387 --> 28:33.479
Mel!

28:35.857 --> 28:38.951
Camille! Camille! Camille! No!

28:58.646 --> 29:01.137
Should've known that whole
good-sis/bad-sis story...

29:01.315 --> 29:02.475
...was showmanship crap.

29:02.683 --> 29:05.652
Oh, and turns out that Kate
was just trying to warn people...

29:05.853 --> 29:07.343
...about her evil bitch sister.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.317
We burned her bones.
So that's gone.

29:09.490 --> 29:10.582
- Dean.
- What?

29:10.792 --> 29:13.693
- All we can do is go stop her.
- Not good enough. By a mile.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.952
I know. Believe me.
But can we talk about this later?

29:16.197 --> 29:17.289
Hey.

29:18.599 --> 29:20.191
How you holding up?

29:20.735 --> 29:22.202
Been better.

29:22.403 --> 29:24.394
- If you need for us to leave...
- I need you guys to leave.

29:25.006 --> 29:26.132
Okay, we will.

29:26.374 --> 29:27.466
It's just that...

29:27.708 --> 29:29.801
...look, Margaret is still out there.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.006
What do you guys need to know?

29:34.482 --> 29:35.813
Is there anything that stood out?

29:39.821 --> 29:43.257
Well, um,
she barely gave a crap about me.

29:43.925 --> 29:47.156
I mean, I was just in the way.
She was all about getting Camille.

29:47.395 --> 29:49.488
- Good, that's something.
- One other thing.

29:49.931 --> 29:51.831
Um, she enjoyed it.

29:53.334 --> 29:54.631
She was smiling.

30:03.177 --> 30:06.340
- I feel naked doing this in daylight.
- Let's just hurry up.

30:23.598 --> 30:24.860
All right, Mags...

30:25.700 --> 30:27.429
...my lighter's juiced this time.

30:34.909 --> 30:35.933
Geraldoed.

30:36.177 --> 30:38.042
- Not good.
- Never good.

30:38.679 --> 30:40.203
If someone knew enough
to take Margaret's bones...

30:40.381 --> 30:41.405
...they're not kidding around.

30:41.682 --> 30:44.446
- That's serious binding magic.
- Pfft!

30:44.986 --> 30:46.214
Great.

30:46.454 --> 30:48.217
Psychic ghost bitch on a leash.

30:48.456 --> 30:49.548
We gotta find those bones.

30:49.790 --> 30:51.121
We gotta find the bonehead.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.752
We'll call Bobby,
see what it takes to harness...

30:54.996 --> 30:57.590
...the power of a ghost?
Yeah.

31:01.602 --> 31:04.298
Hey, Sam, you know why
I'm not going to spend my money...

31:04.472 --> 31:08.203
...at the annual Lily Dale ESP Festival
and Hot Dog Eating Contest this year?

31:08.409 --> 31:09.637
Can't imagine.

31:10.945 --> 31:12.412
Because all the headliners are dead.

31:20.288 --> 31:22.449
You know, after Nikolai...

31:23.658 --> 31:25.626
...they asked Camille to take his spot.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.094
I mean, heh, she's so popular.

31:29.463 --> 31:32.796
- Was so popular.
- Okay, uh, all these people, would you...

31:33.000 --> 31:35.161
Would you say that they're
the, uh, top dogs in town?

31:35.336 --> 31:36.928
Well, it's not really like that.

31:37.138 --> 31:38.799
But they were doing well.
I mean, your grandma?

31:39.040 --> 31:40.302
She wrote a few books.

31:40.508 --> 31:43.102
And Imelda was on the
Nate Berkus show twice.

31:43.344 --> 31:45.608
So, yeah, I guess they were
doing pretty well.

31:46.514 --> 31:48.004
You think that's why
she went after them?

31:49.317 --> 31:51.376
If you had to guess, who do
you think would be next?

31:53.120 --> 31:54.348
I mean, I don't know.

31:54.555 --> 31:56.648
Your grandma was headlining
at the big hall.

31:56.857 --> 31:58.381
Who do you think
they would ask to fill in?

31:58.626 --> 32:00.491
Probably...

32:03.030 --> 32:04.554
...me.

32:07.335 --> 32:10.133
- Hey.
- Agent. You here with my check?

32:10.338 --> 32:11.999
I'm looking for someone
who bought some things from you.

32:12.206 --> 32:13.298
How do you know from me?

32:14.041 --> 32:16.771
I'm doubting they sell
ash-wood altars at the Gas 'N Sip.

32:17.712 --> 32:19.680
Valid. Let me see the list.

32:20.848 --> 32:22.213
Mm-hm.

32:27.555 --> 32:29.853
Ah. Here we go, credit card receipt.

32:30.324 --> 32:32.292
- I assume you want the address?
- That'd be great. Thanks.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.053
It's the least I can do.

32:36.564 --> 32:38.156
I just heard about Camille Thibideaux.

32:40.301 --> 32:41.359
Thanks a lot.

32:43.671 --> 32:44.797
You're welcome.

32:51.312 --> 32:53.439
You sure that'll work?

32:54.749 --> 32:57.843
That should hold her off long enough for
Sam to find the bones and burn them.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.510
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully.

33:01.355 --> 33:04.347
Does it hurt them?
Burning their bones?

33:06.694 --> 33:07.922
I never thought about it.

33:09.597 --> 33:10.723
Probably, yeah.

33:11.532 --> 33:13.193
Good.

33:24.979 --> 33:26.037
Where's the altar?

33:26.847 --> 33:27.905
It's there!

33:34.255 --> 33:36.553
You're not a necromancer.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.617
This is a Lamaze class, I swear.

33:39.894 --> 33:41.987
I believe you. Sorry.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.567
- Om.
- Dean. It's the pawn shop guy.

33:50.805 --> 33:52.773
<i>- How do you know?
- He goose-chased me to the frigging...</i>

33:53.007 --> 33:54.406
...pregnant yoga class.

33:54.642 --> 33:55.939
Figure out where
he put her bones.

33:56.110 --> 33:57.577
<i>- Aah!
- I will.</i>

33:58.112 --> 33:59.272
Fast, Sam.

34:58.472 --> 35:00.440
Somehow I just knew you'd be back.

35:06.347 --> 35:08.577
Hi, agent.

35:09.283 --> 35:10.910
- Put the skull down.
- Okay, okay.

35:11.085 --> 35:12.848
Take it easy. Here.

35:15.289 --> 35:16.984
All right. That's enough.

35:18.692 --> 35:20.717
- Is she gone?
- I doubt it.

35:20.895 --> 35:23.728
- But she can't get past the line, right?
- Right.

35:28.202 --> 35:30.067
- Nice binding spell.
- It doesn't matter.

35:31.539 --> 35:34.508
- She helps me because she wants to.
- What?

35:37.812 --> 35:40.781
Damn it. I hate when they do that.
Get the salt, go.

35:43.250 --> 35:44.274
Dean!

35:49.223 --> 35:50.451
<i>Margaret and me...</i>

35:50.724 --> 35:54.057
...are the same.
We're the real thing.

35:54.895 --> 35:58.797
<i>But guess what,
sometimes the real thing just isn't...</i>

35:59.033 --> 36:00.967
...pretty or entertaining enough.

36:05.306 --> 36:07.797
When I show people
what I'm capable of, it scares them.

36:08.809 --> 36:10.401
I can't pay my rent!

36:15.549 --> 36:16.607
- Get behind me.
- Heh.

36:17.585 --> 36:18.813
That's as far as you go, bitch.

36:18.986 --> 36:20.544
Margaret's happy to kill for me.

36:21.322 --> 36:22.619
She likes the leash.

36:23.457 --> 36:25.152
- You're sick.
- You know what else I am?

36:26.427 --> 36:27.826
A real psychic, you dickbag.

36:31.498 --> 36:32.590
Surprise.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.198
Aw.

36:42.109 --> 36:43.167
Sorry, handsome.

36:45.145 --> 36:47.136
Where are the rest of the bones?

37:00.094 --> 37:03.222
- These people don't deserve to die.
- Are you kidding me?

37:03.731 --> 37:06.700
I live in squalor because I can't
put on a show like them?

37:06.901 --> 37:07.993
Don't do this.

37:09.136 --> 37:10.694
- They're in the bedroom.
- No.

37:15.175 --> 37:16.540
You're not getting in there.

37:30.124 --> 37:32.319
- Ugh!
- Dean!

37:38.232 --> 37:39.699
Too bad.

37:55.182 --> 37:56.911
No! No!

38:05.993 --> 38:07.153
In the bed.

38:07.761 --> 38:09.490
- They were in the bed?
- Yeah.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.188
Ugh, I can't believe he was boning her.

38:12.733 --> 38:14.894
- Dean.
- Can I get you anything else?

38:15.169 --> 38:19.003
Uh, just a refill, and if you affirmate me,
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.741
All righty then, coffee, coming up.

38:27.715 --> 38:29.945
I can't wait to get out of this
fortune cookie.

38:30.851 --> 38:31.909
Dean.

38:35.089 --> 38:38.217
I'm gonna go, uh,
do something outside.

38:41.895 --> 38:42.953
- Hi, have a seat.
- Hi.

38:43.197 --> 38:44.357
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

38:47.267 --> 38:49.201
You didn't stick around
so I could say thank you.

38:50.270 --> 38:51.396
No reason to thank me.

38:52.272 --> 38:53.364
You saved my life.

38:53.941 --> 38:56.239
- Yeah, but not your friend's.
- Well...

38:56.777 --> 39:00.269
...you didn't send that ghost.
So thank you for coming to kill it.

39:03.717 --> 39:04.877
You and Sam seem a little better.

39:07.054 --> 39:08.316
You can tell that from the walk up?

39:08.489 --> 39:09.979
Heh, take it or leave it.

39:11.225 --> 39:12.317
Also guessing...

39:12.493 --> 39:16.190
...you're not so keen to come
visit here again, so this is goodbye.

39:18.432 --> 39:19.922
Wish we'd met on a better week.

39:20.968 --> 39:22.959
- I wish I had better weeks, heh.
- Hmm.

39:23.137 --> 39:27.938
But, uh, hey, you never know. It's not
like you can tell the future, right?

39:28.108 --> 39:29.803
Hmm...

39:32.579 --> 39:36.310
Well, answer's hazy.
Try again later.

39:38.519 --> 39:39.918
Right.

39:45.826 --> 39:46.918
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:48.362 --> 39:49.624
That's your stuff?

39:50.431 --> 39:52.296
Yeah, yeah. I figure we take one car.

39:54.768 --> 39:57.259
Works for me.
You still wanna break my face?

39:59.039 --> 40:00.666
No. Uh, not at this moment.

40:01.375 --> 40:02.467
Look, you know what?

40:02.643 --> 40:04.042
Um...

40:04.745 --> 40:05.769
You were right.

40:06.280 --> 40:07.338
About Amy.

40:07.848 --> 40:13.650
If she was just any monster, I'm not
sure I could've let her walk away.

40:14.121 --> 40:15.611
I don't know. I'll never know.

40:16.390 --> 40:20.383
- So, what are you saying?
- What I'm saying is I get why you did it.

40:20.894 --> 40:22.862
You're trying to make sure
no one else got hurt.

40:23.831 --> 40:25.025
But here's the thing.

40:25.199 --> 40:27.326
You can't just look me in the face
and tell me you're fine.

40:28.035 --> 40:29.832
You're not sleeping.
You drink for the record.

40:30.070 --> 40:31.264
- Oh, here we go.
- Look...

40:31.505 --> 40:34.406
...whatever, last one to preach,
I know. But...

40:34.775 --> 40:35.799
...be honest with me.

40:35.976 --> 40:38.137
How are those the actions of someone
who knows they did the right thing?

40:38.378 --> 40:39.572
- You want me to be honest?
- Yeah.

40:39.780 --> 40:41.179
I went with my gut.

40:41.348 --> 40:43.077
And that felt right.

40:43.550 --> 40:45.541
I didn't trust her, Sam.

40:46.420 --> 40:49.150
Ever since Cass, I'm having
a hard time trusting anybody.

40:50.691 --> 40:53.285
And as far as how I've been acting...

40:55.329 --> 40:57.820
...I don't know, maybe it's because
I don't like lying to you.

40:58.232 --> 41:00.530
You know, doesn't feel right.

41:00.701 --> 41:02.726
You got me there.
I've been, uh, climbing the walls.

41:03.403 --> 41:04.893
I know how that is.

41:08.842 --> 41:13.506
But hey, if I learned one thing from that
museum, sibling acts are tough.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.205
Pfft, don't compare us
to that Hall of Crazy.

41:16.383 --> 41:19.682
We're poster kids of functional family
life compared to them.

41:19.953 --> 41:21.614
- It's a low bar.
- Well, hey...

41:21.822 --> 41:23.790
...grading on a curve's got me
past everything since kindergarten.

41:23.957 --> 41:25.447
- Don't knock it.
- Whatever you say.

41:30.864 --> 41:33.264
I still wanna know
how that guy bent my spoon.

41:34.368 --> 41:36.302
Forget it, Sam. It's Lily Dale.
