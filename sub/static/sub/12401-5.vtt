        Mrs. Barnes,
        can you hear me?

24:30.069 --> 24:31.902
          Where am I?

24:31.904 --> 24:34.772
   (normal voice)
   You're at the Sister of Mercy
   Hospital, Mrs. Barnes.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.174
       You were admitted
       through the ER department
       yesterday evening.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.310
       Amber.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.011
Your daughter's fine,
Mrs. Barnes.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.246
She's okay.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.781
          I want to see her.

24:43.783 --> 24:44.982
                           Soon.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.520
      What happened to me?

24:49.522 --> 24:53.023
  It's not uncommon to block
  out details when you've been
  in a significant trauma.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.992
        Your memory should
        come back at some point.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.360
          What happened?
You're safe here.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.329
Your husband's in custody.
         I don't understand.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.964
He's the one
responsible for this.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.132
                    No.
At the station
he admitted everything.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.034
     Kyle, why would he
     do that? That's crazy.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.936
I'm afraid
it's true, ma'am.
                   No.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.338
      It's not. No,
      I don't believe it.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.373
        No, let me go.
      Just stay back right here.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.775
    Just let me go.
      You cannot get out of bed.
      Watch your arm.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.978
       (sobbing) No!
       Lie back down real quick.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.548
          You've been
          in a serious accident.
          (clamoring)

25:21.787 --> 25:23.187
    Well?

25:25.625 --> 25:27.725
      Couldn't get close enough.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.660
Well, did she react?

25:29.662 --> 25:31.662
You know, in the way
they do around you?

25:31.664 --> 25:33.831
              It's hard to tell.

25:33.833 --> 25:37.134
         Things got complicated.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.636
At least you didn't
get arrested.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.072
            I think I need to go
            home now, Rev.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.574
         I understand.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.243
         First, there's a little
         job we have to do.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.045
      I made some stops in town.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.915
   I do work with some
   of the groups that shelter
   the homeless,

25:50.917 --> 25:52.550
              addicts, runaways.

25:52.552 --> 25:55.319
        The director
        of the mission here
        thinks he's seen Sherry,

25:55.321 --> 25:56.487
   and I want to bring her home.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.824
     Salvage some kind of a win.

26:00.826 --> 26:04.261
Okay. Good luck.
Don't need me for that.

26:04.263 --> 26:08.065
  I think you're underestimating
  the healing qualities
  of a selfless act.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.868
      Gonna take more than
      a selfless act for
      my situation, Rev.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.670
             Well, we have
             to start somewhere.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.605
          You made me face this.

26:14.607 --> 26:18.342
      First with Mildred, Brian,

26:18.344 --> 26:20.744
                 and now Sherry.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.013
         If she's still out here
         because of me...

26:47.406 --> 26:51.842
      (chainsaw starts)

27:10.997 --> 27:12.630
              Hey!

27:16.102 --> 27:18.969
Hey, Paul Bunyan!

27:22.675 --> 27:25.609
       You oughtta know better
       than to sneak up on a man
       with a chainsaw.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.945
You want to shut
that down?

27:27.947 --> 27:30.681
            I'd like to get this
            done before dark.

27:36.288 --> 27:39.857
       Blight brought it down.
       Been meaning to get to it
       for a while.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.927
We go back a long way.

27:43.929 --> 27:47.097
Seen and done some crazy shit.

27:47.099 --> 27:50.668
       Not asking in an official
       capacity, are you?

27:52.104 --> 27:53.370
         We're friends.

27:55.808 --> 28:01.311
I might go so far
as to say best friends, maybe.

28:01.313 --> 28:07.017
I'd like to think
that if I had a problem,
I could come talk to you.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.853
       Wouldn't judge me.

28:09.855 --> 28:12.923
       And that cuts
       both ways, right?

28:15.661 --> 28:17.027
             Sure.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.762
            What's your problem?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.665
        Not my problem.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.634
        (phone ringing)

28:26.138 --> 28:27.604
               Think that's you.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.108
             Yeah.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.650
             Yeah?

28:39.652 --> 28:43.821
     Chief, you were right. That
     missing girl, Lisa Peyton?

28:43.823 --> 28:45.556
         She popped up.

28:45.558 --> 28:48.892
         What?
            Talked to her sister
            out in Wheeling.

28:48.894 --> 28:52.496
  Turns out she was holed up.
  Didn't want her boyfriend
  to know.

28:52.498 --> 28:55.632
       Looks like you were right
       to hold back on the dogs.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.506
                      Good news?

29:03.542 --> 29:05.342
Just a case I'm working.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.646
        So, whose problem is it?

29:11.417 --> 29:13.717
I'm gonna let you
get back to it.

29:13.719 --> 29:17.621
Wouldn't want that blight
to spread to your whole grove.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.962
       (chainsaw starts)

29:32.972 --> 29:34.037
           (knocking)

29:36.142 --> 29:38.275
             Ugh.

29:42.581 --> 29:45.949
I don't need any
magazine subscriptions,
or life insurance,

29:45.951 --> 29:48.652
or house numbers painted
on my curb.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.322
                      Excuse me!

29:59.064 --> 30:00.164
                    Oh.

30:01.167 --> 30:04.201
    I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.154
What do I call you?

30:25.191 --> 30:26.857
            Is a name important?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.027
It's customary.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.595
I'm Mildred.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.066
            Don't meet many
            Mildreds these days.

30:37.636 --> 30:42.806
      Humans are so...
      desperate to express
      their individuality,

30:42.808 --> 30:46.210
     to separate themselves
     from each other.

30:47.813 --> 30:50.681
         Seems so short-sighted.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.684
You really wanna make that
speech wearing that outfit?

30:57.289 --> 30:59.089
         You can call me Sidney.

31:00.226 --> 31:04.862
     These things,
     all these possessions,

31:04.864 --> 31:06.530
          they yours?

31:08.133 --> 31:13.503
     Some of 'em
     from before I arrived.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.606
       Most of 'em since.

31:16.842 --> 31:19.476
  You find your passions here.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.411
                      You, uh...

31:23.716 --> 31:26.917
           Have you found things
           to engage you?

31:26.919 --> 31:28.819
    I have a job.

31:28.821 --> 31:31.255
              Oh. Of course.

31:31.257 --> 31:35.859
           I suppose you're here
           about the Barnes boy.

31:35.861 --> 31:37.594
He came to see you.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.763
       Not on his own.
       The reverend brought him,

31:39.765 --> 31:41.331
                   but he knows.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.601
What he knows wouldn't fill
one of these.

31:46.005 --> 31:49.940
        What if he comes back?
        What if he keeps trying?

31:49.942 --> 31:51.842
     I'll take care of him,

31:51.844 --> 31:53.877
      and the Barnes boy.

31:53.879 --> 31:57.047
They're my responsibility,
not yours.

31:57.049 --> 32:01.818

32:04.256 --> 32:06.857
The reverend gives you any
trouble, you let me know,

32:06.859 --> 32:08.392
but I doubt he will.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.826
                 Wait!

32:12.197 --> 32:13.263

              a girl for trying.

32:31.784 --> 32:34.818

She's fine. She's happier

the one thing you haven't
told me is that you're sorry.

42:33.385 --> 42:36.719
You apologize for everything,
even when you don't have
any reason to.

42:38.156 --> 42:39.923
I always hated that.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.226
                     I'm sorry.

the things they said,

the hardest part...

is if I could erase
ten minutes from our lives...

43:09.955 --> 43:13.289
ten minutes--
it'd all be perfect.

43:19.364 --> 43:24.367

the same person
you always were.
