WEBVTT

00:11.867 --> 00:14.800
Narrator: Coming up,
why is Q at a loss for words?

00:16.667 --> 00:18.300
Wait for it.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.100
What does Murr look like
with a full head of hair?

00:21.100 --> 00:23.700
Sal: Oh, my God!

00:23.700 --> 00:26.467
Narrator: And which joker will
connect with his inner loser

00:26.467 --> 00:28.000
in tonight's punishment?

00:29.967 --> 00:32.767
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:32.767 --> 00:33.867
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:35.567 --> 00:37.167
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:38.967 --> 00:41.733
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:41.733 --> 00:43.767
Joe: Larry!

00:47.367 --> 00:49.300
Today, we're at
Focus Pointe Global,

00:49.300 --> 00:50.767
competing head to head

00:50.767 --> 00:53.233
as TV executives
pitching our latest ideas.

00:53.233 --> 00:55.433
The goal is to convince
a roomful of strangers

00:55.433 --> 00:57.233
that your ideas are better
than the other guy's.

00:57.233 --> 00:59.600
The catch is that we have
no idea what we're pitching

00:59.600 --> 01:02.167
'cause our show ideas have
been written by our opponents.

01:02.167 --> 01:03.700
At the end,
we'll ask the group

01:03.700 --> 01:06.067
to vote for which one of us
had the better ideas.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.900
Whoever gets
the fewest votes loses.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.367
Guys, it's a show
about four friends

01:09.367 --> 01:10.667
since high school, right?
There's one that --

01:10.667 --> 01:12.833
-Pass! Pass!
-No, no, no!

01:16.067 --> 01:17.167
Joe: Here we go.

01:17.167 --> 01:18.800
I have a distinct
advantage here,

01:18.800 --> 01:21.067
because I have worked
as a development executive

01:21.067 --> 01:23.167
for a TV company
for a decade.
That's right.

01:23.167 --> 01:26.067
A few of these ideas are
his real own stupid ideas.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.300
-Hi, guys.
-Thank you, guys, for coming.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.800
We're going to pitch you ideas
for TV shows and movies.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.667
I will start.
This one is "Lil' Cheaters."

01:34.667 --> 01:37.300
Watch the tears spill
as 7-year-olds

01:37.300 --> 01:40.100
who have just committed to their
first boyfriends and girlfriends

01:40.100 --> 01:42.867
see hidden-camera footage
that reveals

01:42.867 --> 01:46.200
their first significant other
being unfaithful.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.833
Come on.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.067
They're 7, though.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.533
Fidelity knows no age.

01:55.067 --> 01:59.467
First one I'd like to pitch is
"Not So Shrimple, Is It?"

02:01.567 --> 02:03.933
In each episode
of this docu-soap,

02:03.933 --> 02:07.900
a different family is given
an excess of leftover shrimp.

02:07.900 --> 02:11.467
What will they do with
all the extra shrimp?

02:14.267 --> 02:16.800
We'll keep going.
We've got a, uh...

02:19.467 --> 02:21.833
"Jamaican Batman,"
a.k.a. "Botmon."

02:23.933 --> 02:26.667
It's the classic story
of Batman reggae-fied.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.333
"'Jamaican' me crazy
for my dead parents."

02:32.667 --> 02:36.133
Yeah, it's like -- You know,
it's like the Jamaican Batman.

02:36.133 --> 02:39.067
This is backfiring, Sal,
so bad!
Wow.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.400
If you love that,
you're gonna love this one.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.967
By the way, that color pink
looks great on you.

02:44.167 --> 02:47.167
Sal's trying to curry favor
by complimenting people.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.400
In this crime drama,
15 Nobel Prize winners

02:51.400 --> 02:54.600
suddenly drop dead
from heat exhaustion

02:54.600 --> 02:56.933
at the Miss America Pageant.

02:56.933 --> 02:59.600
When the Nobel Prize winners
later show up

02:59.600 --> 03:03.633
at the Nathan's
Hot Dog Competition,

03:03.633 --> 03:07.600
no one knows what to think
except for Stephen Hawking,

03:07.600 --> 03:12.767
who can walk again
but won't reveal how.

03:12.767 --> 03:15.200
"Nobel Gases."

03:17.433 --> 03:20.067
Yeah, it's too highbrow.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.133
Oh-ho! Too highbrow.

03:22.133 --> 03:25.400
Okay. Next -- "Samantha Brown
Does It Again."

03:25.400 --> 03:27.667
Everyone's favorite travel host,
Samantha Brown,

03:27.667 --> 03:29.700
is back, doing it again.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.900
She was in that show that ran
for like eight seasons,

03:36.900 --> 03:38.167
"Samantha Brown Does It."

03:39.867 --> 03:41.967
This is a sequel, "Samantha
Brown Does It Again."

03:41.967 --> 03:43.433
What does she do?

03:43.433 --> 03:44.967
She travels the world, explores
different cultures, places.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.467
She does it.
She does it.

03:46.467 --> 03:47.933
-Again.

03:47.933 --> 03:50.367
Again.
She does it again.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.067
It's going
to all the same places

03:52.067 --> 03:54.067
she already was in
all the other episodes?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.200
Again.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.767
Yeah.

03:57.767 --> 03:59.333
Doesn't make any sense.
I don't care if --

03:59.333 --> 04:00.900
I don't care if
it's a documentary.
I love these stories.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.767
That shirt's  on you,
by the way.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.600
Q: Sal's going down,
and he knows it!

04:07.600 --> 04:11.333
Here we go.
"Doc, Make My Abs Hairy."

04:11.333 --> 04:13.133
This is a new
reality show.

04:13.133 --> 04:14.767
Women all over the world

04:14.767 --> 04:16.067
are flocking to make
their abs hairy...

04:16.067 --> 04:17.467
Q: Women are?

04:17.467 --> 04:19.667
...in this elective
cosmetic procedure

04:19.667 --> 04:21.600
that's taken the world
by storm.

04:21.600 --> 04:27.300
And this documentary traces its
origins from 2005 to modern-day.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.600
How much hair?
Mustache hair or full hair?

04:31.600 --> 04:33.433
We're not gonna full --
Not a full Groucho.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.067
Joe:
What does that even mean?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.667
Okay.
Which one of our ideas

04:37.667 --> 04:40.767
do you think are more marketable
or more likely to be used?

04:40.767 --> 04:42.467
I would say his.

04:42.467 --> 04:43.667
You would say James.
Okay.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.700
-You would also say James.
-I say James.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.367
Joe: Murr wins it.

04:48.367 --> 04:49.900
Thank you, sir.
You know what, though?

04:49.900 --> 04:51.667
You look like
a million bucks.

04:53.867 --> 04:55.600
And we work in the
entertainment industry.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.967
And we're basically
just trying

04:56.967 --> 04:58.767
to get feedback of
who has the better ideas.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.300
Murr: Now, Joe wrote
all Q's ideas...

05:00.300 --> 05:02.100
And Q wrote all Joe's.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.667
Okay.
This one's "Pound Town."

05:04.667 --> 05:06.900
Just outside of London,
a group of obese people

05:06.900 --> 05:10.167
run a kill shelter in this
daily two-hour dramedy.

05:10.167 --> 05:13.467
-It's on every day.

05:13.467 --> 05:15.367
When the money is tight
and the dogs are gone,

05:15.367 --> 05:18.233
what will Mr. and Mrs. Pound
do for money and food?

05:18.233 --> 05:20.733
That could be
an interesting one.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.633
So, this is called
"Shallow Drowning."

05:26.633 --> 05:29.200
Follow three ministers
as they set off on a pilgrimage

05:29.200 --> 05:31.367
to bring faith
to a sinking island.

05:31.367 --> 05:32.667
The residents are cannibals,

05:32.667 --> 05:36.100
and the ministers are chubby,
and the tide is rising.

05:37.667 --> 05:38.933
-Okay.

05:38.933 --> 05:41.200
-Sounds awful.
-"It sounds awful."

05:41.200 --> 05:43.300
Just from an
interest standpoint,

05:43.300 --> 05:44.733
people know what it is.

05:44.733 --> 05:46.333
That's something
they're gonna watch.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.667
What?

05:47.667 --> 05:50.500
Somebody get eaten this week?
How far is it gonna sink?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.867
Maybe it will sink this week
while we're watching.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.933
All right. I'm up.
"Tickle Me Timbers."

05:55.933 --> 05:58.567
From executive --

05:58.567 --> 06:00.800
Just the title
gets me every time.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.233
From executive producer
Chuck Sharts, "Tickle Me Ti--"

06:05.700 --> 06:08.467
"Tickle Me Timbers"
is so funny.

06:10.067 --> 06:13.333
Murr:  The plant!
Get the plant out of the way!

06:13.333 --> 06:15.533
"Tickle Me Timbers" is
an imaginative reinvention

06:15.533 --> 06:17.900
of a Somali pirate hijacking
Captain Phillips.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.067
In each episode, we see
pirates taking a new ship

06:20.067 --> 06:22.167
and breaking hearts as
they break all the rules.

06:22.167 --> 06:23.900
"Tickle Me Timbers."

06:25.767 --> 06:30.533
That sounds the best
out of all the ideas so far.

06:30.533 --> 06:31.900
All right.
Go ahead, bud. You're up.

06:31.900 --> 06:35.133
This is, "Hola Mami!
Where Are You?"

06:35.133 --> 06:37.533
Alice is
a savvy businesswoman

06:37.533 --> 06:39.067
who is too busy
for a relationship.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.800
Mike...

06:43.933 --> 06:47.433
Mike pretends to be a gay,
blind Puerto Rican man

06:47.433 --> 06:49.867
in order to get close
to Alice...

06:52.533 --> 06:54.400
...the woman of his dreams.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.733
So...

06:58.733 --> 07:00.733
-That would work.
-Yeah, that'd work.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.800
All right, if you liked --
if you like that,

07:05.800 --> 07:07.733
you're gonna love
"In the Dog House."

07:07.733 --> 07:09.833
A former salesman
with an eating disorder

07:09.833 --> 07:11.867
has his life ruined
when his foreign --

07:11.867 --> 07:13.900
when his foreign wife

07:13.900 --> 07:16.900
can't stop bringing home bichon
frises and spending money,

07:16.900 --> 07:18.400
driving him into madness

07:18.400 --> 07:21.133
and murdering
in this harrowing drama.

07:21.133 --> 07:24.500
It's Joe!
It's a description of Joe!

07:24.500 --> 07:27.233
-This sounds like --
-My life.

07:27.233 --> 07:29.500
I probably would watch it.
Is it a comedy?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.267
Make no mistake -- there's
nothing funny about this one.

07:31.267 --> 07:33.767
Yeah, this is just
a straight-up drama.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.667
You're up.
I'm gonna take a little time.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.967
It's called "Chillin'
With Mr. Broadway,"

07:42.967 --> 07:45.067
and it's
a multi-cam comedy

07:45.067 --> 07:47.867
which brings Morgan Freeman
back to series television

07:47.867 --> 07:50.667
as a mythical and mystical
Lord of Broadway.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.467
Each episode deals with...

07:55.433 --> 07:56.767
Continue.

07:58.533 --> 08:00.667
-Go ahead. It's great.
-I wanna hear it.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.933
Each episode deals
with the Lord of --

08:04.567 --> 08:06.200
-Hold on.
-Wait for it.

08:08.300 --> 08:12.067
He's gone!

08:12.067 --> 08:13.600
-Here, I'll help you out.
-I can't even read it!

08:13.600 --> 08:15.333
Each episode deals
with the Lord of Broadway's

08:15.333 --> 08:17.100
ever-growing harem
of chorus girl and choir boys,

08:17.100 --> 08:18.767
in which he secretly
controls

08:18.767 --> 08:20.600
New York City's
financial nucleus.

08:23.267 --> 08:24.800
That makes no sense.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.633
It's Morgan Freeman.
You can't beat.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.933
I mean, Morgan Freeman's
played those kind of roles

08:32.933 --> 08:34.267
the last 20 years.

08:34.267 --> 08:35.433
Yeah, he plays good roles.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.400
So, if you had to pick one,

08:39.400 --> 08:42.100
who would you say has
the more marketable ideas?

08:42.100 --> 08:43.967
I'm gonna go with yours.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.067
Mine? Okay.

08:47.067 --> 08:48.300
-Tiebreaker.
-Yeah, yours.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.833
Me? Oh, that's me!

08:49.833 --> 08:51.133
Oh, you got one, though.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.500
Murr: Joe wins.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.933
Narrator: Sal and Q struck out
on these pitches,

08:54.933 --> 08:57.300
so they're first up
on the loser board.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.167
Today, we're teaming up
behind the counter

08:59.167 --> 09:01.300
at Hill Country Barbecue
in downtown Brooklyn.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.633
While working the counter,
we'll have to do and say

09:02.633 --> 09:03.867
what the other team
tells us.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.633
If you refuse to do or
say anything, you lose.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.167
What they said.

09:08.167 --> 09:11.500
**

09:11.500 --> 09:13.367
Murr:
Sal, help this guy out,

09:13.367 --> 09:16.300
but, Joe, keep almost
falling backward.

09:20.833 --> 09:23.433
To stay or to go?
To stay, all right.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.100
And what was it?

09:30.733 --> 09:33.133
You look like
a psychopath.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.167
-Whoa!
-All right.

09:34.167 --> 09:36.067
-Yeah, you're good, you're good.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.733
Watch your step, man.

09:38.733 --> 09:40.567
Wh-o-o-o-oa!

09:40.567 --> 09:42.333
Murr: This is not working,
but it is --

09:42.333 --> 09:44.233
Whoops, Joe!
Look out, look out, Joe!

09:44.233 --> 09:46.767
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Stop doing it.

09:46.767 --> 09:49.333
He's just doing it
'cause it's so bad.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.367
-Oh, yeah.

09:51.367 --> 09:54.400
Q: All right, Sal,
no matter who comes up next,

09:54.400 --> 09:56.733
just inform them that
you don't normally serve

09:56.733 --> 09:58.500
intoxicated customers,

09:58.500 --> 10:00.800
but if they behave,
you'll let them eat.

10:02.667 --> 10:05.067
-I think she looks drunk to Sal.

10:05.067 --> 10:06.533
It's to

10:06.533 --> 10:08.967
All right, that's good, though,
because if you're intoxicated,

10:08.967 --> 10:10.967
you cannot eat
in the establishment.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.500
And it's nothing personal.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.067
I'm not intoxicated.

10:14.067 --> 10:16.167
Right.
But we'll have it saved to-go.

10:16.167 --> 10:17.467
Murr: Oh, my God.

10:17.467 --> 10:20.367
The thing is, just,
if someone's here intoxicated,

10:20.367 --> 10:22.500
then we can't have them
eating...

10:22.500 --> 10:24.700
Joe, mime whatever
Sal's saying.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.067
So we can't have people
who are intoxicated...

10:27.067 --> 10:28.133
-Coming here.
-...here.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.233
No, just the drunks.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.067
No, just the drun--
just the drunks.

10:33.067 --> 10:36.067
Just the people
who have been drinking.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.100
Say, "Sure," and wink --
1, 2, 3.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.400
Both: Sure.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.100
You have a good day.

10:47.133 --> 10:48.767
-Yes.

10:48.767 --> 10:50.800
Guys, you think this guy needs
a deejay at his wedding?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.267
Just in case
you're in the market --

10:52.267 --> 10:53.700
I'm not sure
where you stand at --

10:53.700 --> 10:55.533
but if you're looking to get
married, I deejay.

10:55.533 --> 10:57.900
-He's sick at them. He's sick.
-Yeah.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.567
Sal, you're his hype man.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.667
-I'm his hype man.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.800
Yeah, I'd be nothing
without him.

11:03.800 --> 11:04.933
He's done all my weddings.

11:04.933 --> 11:06.300
Oh, yeah?
All your weddings?

11:06.300 --> 11:07.700
-Yeah.
-Three. Wow.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.400
My first wedding,
she slept with the deejay.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.933
My first wedding,
she slept with the deejay.

11:14.933 --> 11:18.400
Yeah, that was my bad.
I didn't realize that
they were that serious.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.733
But that's how
we became friends.
That's how we met up.

11:20.733 --> 11:23.500
Second wedding, deejay.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.967
-Yeah, we're tight.
-Second wedding...deejay.

11:25.967 --> 11:28.667
Yeah, but that one wasn't my
fault, if I'm gonna be honest.

11:29.967 --> 11:32.667
Okay, if you need me,
I'm here on Tuesdays.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.467
Whoa! Whoa!

11:39.667 --> 11:41.533
Doesn't make any sense.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.633
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

11:43.633 --> 11:45.300
-It's so slippery.
-It's beyond stupid.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.933
Q:
Sal, say loudly  --

11:47.933 --> 11:49.933
"You know the one tattoo
I would never get?"

11:49.933 --> 11:52.333
You know the one tattoo
I would never get?

11:52.333 --> 11:54.067
A neck tattoo.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.367
No, I'm not saying that.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.933
So, that's it?
You give up

12:03.933 --> 12:07.100
Joe, you know what
screams criminal to me?

12:07.100 --> 12:09.067
You know what screams
criminal to me?

12:09.067 --> 12:10.200
A neck tattoo.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.900
-No. No.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.900
Keep it to -- Keep it to people
on that side of the counter.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.800
Yeah, that's it.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.200
So, today, we came in,
and we saw this thing.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.567
It is fake hair
that you apply.

12:23.567 --> 12:25.667
And so we made Murray

12:25.667 --> 12:28.233
put on a full head of hair
today using this.

12:28.233 --> 12:32.267
So, let's see Murray
with hair.

12:33.733 --> 12:36.567
Oh, my God!

12:36.567 --> 12:39.400
-Come on.
-Oh, my God.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.500
You know what you look like?
You look like Curious George.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.433
It's weird, man!

12:46.433 --> 12:50.267
Does that look real to people
that don't know you?

12:50.267 --> 12:52.500
-Because it looks real.
-Yeah.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.867
You don't even know what it's
like being in its presence.

12:56.433 --> 12:58.267
Q:
Lunch rush is over.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.400
Joe: You guys just hanging out
by yourselves down there?

13:00.400 --> 13:02.300
Who is that? Shaw--
Is the new guy's name Shawn?

13:02.300 --> 13:03.600
Which guy?

13:03.600 --> 13:05.333
Could they send Shawn
over here?

13:05.333 --> 13:07.667
-Come here.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.700
-Shawn, get over here.
-Stick this in your ear.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.300
-Come on behind the counter.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.067
Come behind the counter.
You're working.

13:13.067 --> 13:15.300
-Stick that in your ear.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.367
You're on camera.
We're off shift.

13:18.367 --> 13:21.067
Well, I must say, this is
quite the turn of events.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.367
Well, there's no customers.
What are we gonna do?

13:23.367 --> 13:24.733
-Yeah.

13:24.733 --> 13:26.600
Joe: Just turn to the guy
on the right there.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.233
Tell him that his
neck tattoo is lame.

13:29.833 --> 13:32.167
Oh, wait.
Hey, Shawn, let me
ask you a question.

13:32.167 --> 13:34.067
It's not that easy,
is it?!

13:35.733 --> 13:37.467
No, no!

13:46.233 --> 13:47.533
-Hi.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.433
Just a rack of ribs?

13:49.433 --> 13:51.467
Shawn, say,
"Speaking of rack of ribs,"

13:51.467 --> 13:53.133
and then point
at the woman's boobs.

13:59.467 --> 14:02.633
Look how embarrassed
this poor kid is!

14:02.633 --> 14:04.400
Q: Nice work, buddy.
Thank you.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.300
Guys, did you spill
something back here?

14:06.300 --> 14:07.733
Did we spill something?

14:07.733 --> 14:10.167
Whoa! Whoa!

14:10.167 --> 14:11.833
Whoa!

14:11.833 --> 14:13.600
Now you're doing it
on your own?

14:13.600 --> 14:15.100
-It was so fun.
-It's not.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.800
It was a swing
and a huge miss.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.133
It's sweeping the nation.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.833
-Murr, mess up your hair.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.367
Sal: Go ahead and run
your fingers through it.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.733
Ooh.

14:28.733 --> 14:31.700
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my God.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.800
Joe: Oh, and she's --
"What is this?"

14:33.800 --> 14:36.300
You look like you just
mud-wrestled and lost.

14:36.300 --> 14:39.933
Sal: Q, take some money out
of your wallet, soak it,

14:39.933 --> 14:43.067
then run back in and say,
"Dude, I just found a
twenty in the 'terlet.'"

14:45.267 --> 14:47.233
Welcome to Hill Country.
How can I help you?

14:47.233 --> 14:48.367
Woman:
I think I'll have the --

14:48.367 --> 14:49.533
-Happy day!

14:49.533 --> 14:51.200
I just found a twenty
in the terlet.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.800
You took that from
the customer terlet?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.200
You can't say 'terlet'
enough.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.433
It was just lying there
in the terlet.

14:58.433 --> 15:01.067
Joe: Do you think it's one
of these fake twenties?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.367
You don't think this is fake,
do you?

15:02.367 --> 15:04.267
I don't know if it's fake.
Can you see the stripe?

15:06.100 --> 15:07.967
No, that's
a terlet twenty.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.767
Did you use the men's room,
and did you lose a twenty?

15:12.767 --> 15:14.867
-No.

15:17.267 --> 15:19.733
Sal:
By the way, Murray's head...

15:19.733 --> 15:21.467
He just noticed
what he looked like.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.333
We're talking about
the terlet twenty,

15:23.333 --> 15:24.867
and we forgot about
your head.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.067
Narrator: Sal's hopes of winning
got flushed down the terlet,

15:29.067 --> 15:31.200
making him tonight's big loser.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.933
Today, we're here
for Sal's punishment,

15:32.933 --> 15:34.467
and, Sal,
do you know what it is?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.967
-Of course not.

15:36.967 --> 15:39.433
No, but I --
I already was a psychic.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.133
That's right, you were,
but you were never

15:41.133 --> 15:42.967
the subject of a psychic medium,
which you are today.

15:42.967 --> 15:44.633
Okay.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.967
Sal, whatever our psychic
says about you,

15:46.967 --> 15:48.300
you have to agree with.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.200
And when the psychic
asks you a question,

15:50.200 --> 15:52.067
you have to give
the embarrassing answer

15:52.067 --> 15:53.333
that we, of course, give you.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.700
-Yes.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.833
Wait. So what if some real
stuff starts coming out?

15:56.833 --> 15:58.400
We could hope.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.767
Joe, one of the first things
that I get from you

16:01.767 --> 16:03.367
is kids
playing with jacks.

16:03.367 --> 16:05.167
We got Jesse Bravo
in the house tonight.
That's right, yeah.

16:05.167 --> 16:07.067
He's a real-deal
psychic medium.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.267
I'm just feeling the --
your history.

16:09.267 --> 16:12.633
And as a little switch, we have
an earpiece in Jesse Bravo.

16:12.633 --> 16:15.267
So Jesse will be saying
what we want him to say.

16:15.267 --> 16:18.633
Yeah. I'm getting some vibes
over here, and, uh...

16:18.633 --> 16:20.533
Uh, you, sir, over here.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.200
Q:
Here we go, here we go.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.167
Sal has to agree with anything
the psychic says about him.

16:25.167 --> 16:26.933
-Sal.

16:26.933 --> 16:28.467
Thank you so much.

16:28.467 --> 16:30.933
So, we got a lot
going on here.

16:30.933 --> 16:32.767
I definitely can sense it.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.733
Was there a recent falling-out
with your family?

16:36.733 --> 16:39.467
Is there a recent falling-out
with your family?

16:39.467 --> 16:41.067
Yes.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.767
Something happened
with your niece?

16:42.767 --> 16:44.100
Yes.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.367
I did.

16:52.567 --> 16:53.933
I'm the cool uncle.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.567
I'm known
as the cool uncle.

16:59.567 --> 17:02.300
Joe: "I'm the cool uncle."

17:02.300 --> 17:04.200
And she's 7?

17:04.200 --> 17:06.400
6.

17:08.167 --> 17:10.233
I feel like
this will resolve itself.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.867
All right, I feel like this
is gonna resolve itself.

17:12.867 --> 17:17.200
I feel like you've started
to date again, like, recently?

17:17.200 --> 17:18.733
And you had a date
that went well?

17:18.733 --> 17:19.867
Yes.

17:19.867 --> 17:21.133
Her name is Nadira.

17:21.133 --> 17:24.400
The person that I'm referencing
is named Nadira.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.533
I call her Nads.

17:25.533 --> 17:26.733
I call her Nads.

17:26.733 --> 17:28.433
She's annoying
but not too much.

17:28.433 --> 17:29.900
Uh...

17:32.433 --> 17:36.067
-Oh, this is tough.
-The punishment.

17:36.067 --> 17:38.967
She's, like --
I'm getting to know her.

17:38.967 --> 17:40.533
She's a little annoying
but not too much.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.233
Doesn't give
too much back talk.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.733
Um...

17:50.733 --> 17:52.533
She doesn't give
a lot of back talk.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.067
She's perfect.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.400
Did you have to
fire your mother?

17:59.400 --> 18:01.600
Did you have to
fire your mother?

18:01.600 --> 18:02.767
I did.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.367
I'm picking up that
you did it by e

18:04.367 --> 18:06.533
You did it by e-mail.
Is that the problem here?

18:06.533 --> 18:09.367
It was a text
followed by e-mail.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.500
A text followed up
by e-mail!

18:12.500 --> 18:14.933
You have to do everything
with a paper trail.

18:14.933 --> 18:16.733
Yeah, this will
resolve itself.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.900
You were traveling
recently?

18:19.900 --> 18:23.267
Uh, I was --
actually got back Tuesday.

18:23.267 --> 18:24.800
There was some type
of incident?

18:24.800 --> 18:27.167
Like, subway,
underground, Tokyo?

18:27.167 --> 18:29.700
I mean, I was
on the subway in Tokyo.

18:29.700 --> 18:30.967
There was a pretty girl.

18:30.967 --> 18:33.200
Uh, there was a young lady,
a pretty girl.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.967
I thought to myself, "Wow."

18:34.967 --> 18:36.933
And I thought to myself,
you know, "Wow."

18:36.933 --> 18:39.200
"These Tokyos,
they're pretty."

18:39.200 --> 18:41.233
"These Tokyos..."

18:45.067 --> 18:46.900
"These -- Th-These, uh --

18:46.900 --> 18:50.467
These -- These Tokyos are --
These Tokyos are pretty."

18:51.933 --> 18:53.700
I, uh...

18:53.700 --> 18:56.067
I want to --
I just want to sit down.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.067
"I just want to sit down"!

18:58.067 --> 18:59.700
You have a fish
named Bubbles?

18:59.700 --> 19:01.067
Uh, yes, yes.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.500
Well, that's interesting,
'cause I feel like

19:02.500 --> 19:04.200
you wanted to name it
something else.
I did, yeah.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.667
But you were afraid people would
judge you harshly for the name.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.367
You felt like people would judge
you harshly for the name?

19:09.367 --> 19:11.467
I feel like people would judge
me on Bubbles, but, yeah.

19:11.467 --> 19:13.100
-Yeah.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.367
Uh...

19:15.967 --> 19:17.267
Lamar Scrotum.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.533
He came up with that
by himself!

19:21.533 --> 19:24.067
I think Bubbles is the
better choice. Yeah.

19:25.533 --> 19:29.500
But I sense that there may be
some people around your life

19:29.500 --> 19:31.167
disguising themselves
as friends

19:31.167 --> 19:32.833
but they're really
probably your enemies.

19:32.833 --> 19:34.600
That's dead-on accurate.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.600
But it's okay. I feel like
it's gonna resolve itself.

19:39.133 --> 19:40.700
-Thank you, Sal.
-Thank you so much.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.400
-Thank you so much.
-Appreciate that. All right.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.167
Sometimes you win some,
sometimes you lose some.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.333
Today you lost.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.100
-Well done.
-Yeah, that was a good one.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.267
-Good work, fellas.
-He didn't see that one coming.

19:51.267 --> 19:53.233
All right, let me get some
quiet here for a second.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.800
Quiet, please.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.933
* Whose phone is ringing?
Mine, mine *

20:02.933 --> 20:05.367
* Whose phone is ringing?
Mine, mine *

20:05.367 --> 20:06.433
I, uh...

20:06.433 --> 20:07.533
* Whose phone is ring-- *

20:07.533 --> 20:08.667
I got to take this.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.500
Oh, my God. How the
do I get out of here?

20:20.700 --> 20:22.367
Welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

20:22.367 --> 20:24.567
This is where Sal
just got psyched out

20:24.567 --> 20:26.067
in a paranormal punishment,

20:26.067 --> 20:27.967
and you get to see
a behind-the-scenes look

20:27.967 --> 20:29.133
at how it all happened.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.633
And I'm sensing
you might even get

20:30.633 --> 20:33.000
some bonus footage
from tonight's episode?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.467
So, what's the idea behind
this punishment, and why Sal?

20:35.467 --> 20:37.167
Because we saw
Sal flop horribly

20:37.167 --> 20:39.533
on the other side of it
when he was the psychic.

20:39.533 --> 20:40.733
Ah. Right.

20:40.733 --> 20:43.533
You have a secret handshake
with your BFF.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.133
Are you sure?

20:47.833 --> 20:48.967
We're doing stairs.

20:48.967 --> 20:50.267
I'm already regretting
my decision.

20:50.267 --> 20:52.700
Q: Come on, guys!
Come on! Huh?

20:52.700 --> 20:54.867
Can we just film this and make
this one of my punishments?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.633
"Joe, you have to
walk up stairs."

20:58.633 --> 21:00.533
Today, we're here
for Sal's punishment,

21:00.533 --> 21:02.167
and, Sal, do you know
what it is?

21:02.167 --> 21:04.400
-Of course not.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.367
What if some real stuff
starts coming out?

21:06.367 --> 21:07.633
We can hope. We can hope.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.200
I don't want to do that.
That's really bad.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.567
Oh, wait.
That's another punishment.

21:10.567 --> 21:13.500
-Let's just do that.
-Just read me.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.767
Let people
redeem themselves.

21:15.767 --> 21:17.500
Find someone else?

21:17.500 --> 21:19.467
Pick out what people
you want to film?

21:19.467 --> 21:21.167
Yeah, we want to find people --

21:21.167 --> 21:23.567
Laughing is good.
Confusion is better.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.867
Discomfort is the goal.
Mission: Uncomfortable.

21:26.867 --> 21:30.300
The original title of
"Impractical Jokers."

21:30.300 --> 21:33.400
You know, I feel like there's,
like, a lawsuit or a litigation.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.733
Yeah.

21:37.067 --> 21:38.900
Sal, "Yeah, I sued them
for not having

21:38.900 --> 21:40.700
enough options
for plus-sized men."

21:40.700 --> 21:44.100
Uh, they don't have
enough options,

21:44.100 --> 21:46.867
uh, for --
for plus-sized males.

21:46.867 --> 21:48.767
They countersued, though,
and they --

21:48.767 --> 21:50.800
they ended up --
they ended up winning.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.833
Well, that's okay. I feel like
it's gonna resolve itself.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.433
Legally, it has to.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.600
What was going through your mind
as Sal was saying those things?

22:02.600 --> 22:05.700
I was listening
to some of the details,

22:05.700 --> 22:07.433
and I was trying to
internalize some of them.

22:07.433 --> 22:09.700
And I'm saying to myself,
"Is this really true?"

22:09.700 --> 22:11.067
Yeah.

22:11.067 --> 22:13.933
And I was like,
"Should I judge him?"
Right, yeah.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.133
Something happened
with your niece?

22:16.133 --> 22:17.833
-Yes, yes.

22:17.833 --> 22:19.367
I'm known
as the cool uncle.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.500
I think that was about 50/50,
how much was true.

22:23.500 --> 22:28.400
So, who is, like,
Gabriella, Ali, and Kelly?

22:28.400 --> 22:29.667
Those are exes of mine.

22:29.667 --> 22:31.200
Getting some more names.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.100
Okay, I'm getting
some more names now.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.533
-Christine...
-Christine...

22:34.533 --> 22:36.400
-...Nicole...
-...Nicole...

22:36.400 --> 22:37.800
-...Steph...
-...Steph...

22:37.800 --> 22:38.833
-...Stella...
-...Stella...

22:38.833 --> 22:40.067
-...Nancy.
-...Nancy.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.933
I dated a lot of people.
I -- I have a lot of exes.

22:42.933 --> 22:44.367
And Gary.

22:44.367 --> 22:46.133
-And Gary.
-Yep.

22:46.133 --> 22:47.833
That's my ex
from college.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.800
So, Casey, what's your
favorite color?

22:51.800 --> 22:52.933
Uh, it's always been --

22:52.933 --> 22:54.267
That's all the time
we have, everybody.

22:54.267 --> 22:56.233
Thanks for tuning in to
"Impractical Insider."

22:56.233 --> 22:58.533
You put the mike to them?

22:58.533 --> 23:01.300
You guys,
everybody say, "Hey!"

23:01.300 --> 23:04.167
I hope everybody
at home said, "Hey."
I hope so.

23:05.833 --> 23:07.900
Joe, grab something
from under the counter.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.567
All right, now push it
in front of the counter.

23:10.567 --> 23:12.233
On the floor.

23:12.233 --> 23:14.500
-Yeah. Now go pick it up.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.833
Oh, God.
Come on, guys.

23:17.967 --> 23:19.067
You're doing this again?

23:19.067 --> 23:21.067
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

23:21.067 --> 23:22.267
Whoa-ho-ho!

23:22.267 --> 23:24.167
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

23:24.167 --> 23:25.433
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

23:27.533 --> 23:28.667
Oh-oh! Zoinks!

23:30.767 --> 23:33.167
Zoinks!

23:35.533 --> 23:37.933
Sal: Shawn, the floor's
slippery. Start falling.

23:40.300 --> 23:43.067
Shawn: Whoa!

23:43.067 --> 23:46.533
-The kid's a natural.
-He's better than you, Joe.
