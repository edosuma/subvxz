<i>Catlock, Feline Detective </i>is back on!

00:37.160 --> 00:40.800
She's about to solve
"The Case of the Stolen Spaghetti".

00:41.040 --> 00:43.879
<i>Look, Sergeant Squeak, the final clue!</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:48.879

-What? What did she say?
-Um...

00:57.680 --> 01:00.720
<i>I'm sorry, Catlock.</i>
<i>I didn't quite catch that.</i>

I missed it again!

[blows nose loudly]

01:13.759 --> 01:17.440
Stanley! Oh, no!
Do you have the snail sniffles?

01:17.600 --> 01:21.080
[stuffy nose] Yup.
Sorry I ruined your TV show, Moon.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.880
But I've seen it. The rabbit did it.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.600
I knew it!

01:25.720 --> 01:27.560
[sneezes]

01:27.720 --> 01:31.479
Aw! We'll make you feel better.
I'll find a blanket.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.880
I'll get the juice.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.199
Wow! That was close.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.199
If there's one thing in the world
I do not like, it's--

01:44.360 --> 01:45.800
Getting wet.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.720
Poor Stanley. He's more slime than snail.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.839
[plugged up] If only I had
my Grammie's soup.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.520
Ever since I was little,
it was the only thing

01:57.679 --> 01:59.679
that made me feel better.

01:59.839 --> 02:02.160
[blows nose]

02:02.280 --> 02:04.640
Ollie, I am having a brainstorm!

02:05.000 --> 02:07.960
Uh-oh. When you get a brainstorm,

02:08.079 --> 02:10.400
I always get dragged off somewhere.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.799
Let's just take poor Stanley
to his Grammie's

02:12.960 --> 02:14.799
for some of that feel-better soup!

02:14.920 --> 02:16.799
Will you be able
to make the trip, Stanley?

02:16.920 --> 02:19.160
For Grammie's soup! Oh, yes!

02:19.320 --> 02:21.640
I almost feel better
just thinking about it!

02:21.840 --> 02:24.239
-For Stanley?
-For Stanley!

02:24.359 --> 02:27.200
Stanley's Grammie
doesn't live very far, does she?

02:27.359 --> 02:28.200
[embarrassed laugh]

02:34.480 --> 02:35.480
Whoo!

02:36.600 --> 02:37.799
Whee!

02:46.320 --> 02:52.400
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>now arriving in Kraków, Poland.</i>

02:54.200 --> 02:58.040
Poland? We came all the way
to Poland for soup?

02:58.640 --> 03:01.200
It better be the best soup
in the whole world!

03:01.640 --> 03:02.880
Oh, it will be.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.519
Poland's the land of yummy,
comforting grandma food.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.720
[sneezes]

03:07.840 --> 03:09.000
Right, Stanley?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.519
Stan?

03:11.079 --> 03:12.600
Where did he go?

03:12.720 --> 03:14.880
Don't worry, I'll find him!

03:15.000 --> 03:20.200
This is a job for Moonlock,
Feline Detective!

03:21.519 --> 03:23.760
I'll just follow his slime trail!

03:23.880 --> 03:25.280
Whoa!

03:25.399 --> 03:26.959
Look out for the fountain!

03:27.079 --> 03:29.560
No, no, no, no, no, no!

03:34.720 --> 03:37.440
Whoa!

03:38.959 --> 03:41.160
Hey, guys! I made it!

03:41.280 --> 03:42.880
I'm still dry!

03:43.000 --> 03:44.359
I'm still--

03:50.239 --> 03:51.920
[door bell rings]

03:52.640 --> 03:54.399
Grammie!

03:54.519 --> 03:56.480
Oh, my goodness!

03:56.640 --> 04:00.959
My sickly little Stanleykins, lovely Moon,

04:01.119 --> 04:02.959
and is that Ollie?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.399
He fell in the fountain,
Stanley's Grammie.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.200
He's super grumpy.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.160
[chuckling]

04:08.280 --> 04:10.320
Well, not for long.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.079
Come in and get cosy.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.719
Now, you must rest, Stanleykins.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.200
There! All dry.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.960
Now, here's a list
of what I need for the soup.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.760
Go! Quick, quick, quick!

04:28.479 --> 04:31.240
Mr. Stanleykins needs to feel better!

04:31.360 --> 04:34.640
Oh, and watch out for the Smigus-Dyngus!

04:34.800 --> 04:37.280
-Hmm?
-The what-us-who-us?

04:37.440 --> 04:41.000
Don't know. But we have
soup ingredients to track down.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.919
[gasps] Moon! Look at the cheese!

04:47.599 --> 04:48.680
Mmm!

04:49.599 --> 04:52.120
Ollie, focus! We have soup to make!

04:52.360 --> 04:55.440
We need three carrots,
two potatoes, and one--

04:55.800 --> 04:57.640
Look out!

04:59.440 --> 05:00.960
That was refreshing!

05:01.080 --> 05:03.719
OK. Who just threw water at us?

05:03.840 --> 05:06.120
This is my last dry shirt, Moon!

05:06.240 --> 05:07.640
I cannot get wet again!

05:08.120 --> 05:10.039
Ooh! A mystery!

05:10.159 --> 05:12.080
Another job for...

05:12.360 --> 05:15.919
Moonlock, Feline Detective!

05:16.919 --> 05:18.200
Detective Moonlock here.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.640
Did you see anyone throwing water?

05:21.479 --> 05:22.800
Smigus-Dyngus.

05:23.479 --> 05:25.479
What does that mean?

05:25.800 --> 05:26.640
No clue.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.640
[gasps] But there's one!

05:28.800 --> 05:31.680
Looks like there were two water throwers,

05:31.919 --> 05:34.120
one teeny and one huge!

05:34.359 --> 05:36.400
Let's follow the prints!

05:40.200 --> 05:43.280
Ollie! The footsteps lead to...

05:43.400 --> 05:44.359
to...

05:46.080 --> 05:47.800
What is this place?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.840
It's a pierogi stand. See?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.400
Mmm!

05:51.520 --> 05:54.280
Little Polish dumplings
stuffed with yummy fillings.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.719
[gasps] Wait!

05:56.080 --> 05:58.760
Don't we need those
for poor Stanley's feel-better-soup?

05:59.320 --> 06:01.520
Right! We need three carrot pierogies,

06:02.120 --> 06:03.800
two potato pierogies,

06:03.919 --> 06:06.520
ninety-three onion pierogies, and one--

06:06.640 --> 06:07.560
Look out!

06:11.599 --> 06:12.880
Uh-oh.

06:13.599 --> 06:15.359
Ollie? You OK?

06:15.479 --> 06:18.400
Of course I am. I'm dry.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.840
Now let's get
those soup ingredients, before--

06:21.000 --> 06:22.159
[gasps]

06:22.840 --> 06:25.120
Three sets of footprints this time.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.599
All right, whoever you are.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.120
Do you know who you're messing with here?

06:29.280 --> 06:32.080
A cat pretending to be a detective,
that's who!

06:32.240 --> 06:33.840
Now show yourself!

06:35.799 --> 06:39.080
Hmm. Everything seems normal.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.400
Too normal. So what's going on?

06:42.560 --> 06:44.479
Elementary, my dear Ollie.

06:44.599 --> 06:46.039
Based on these footprints,

06:46.159 --> 06:49.440
it seems we have two different pranksters!

06:49.599 --> 06:51.520
They must be working together!

06:51.640 --> 06:52.840
[gasp]

06:52.960 --> 06:56.280
You better get shopping
for poor Stanley, while I solve

06:56.440 --> 06:58.680
"The Case of the Weird Wetness"!

07:09.760 --> 07:12.599
It looks like we're not
the only wet ones in town!

07:12.719 --> 07:15.159
[laughter]

07:15.320 --> 07:16.919
What's going on around here, mister?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.760
[laughs] Smigus-Dyngus!

07:20.200 --> 07:22.000
Ollie, this is too much!

07:22.200 --> 07:24.880
I still don't know who's throwing water!

07:25.039 --> 07:28.120
Then let's just get the ingredients
before it's too late!

07:28.239 --> 07:29.239
But my case!

07:29.359 --> 07:30.200
I need to solve--

07:30.320 --> 07:33.479
Besides, these are my last dry clothes

07:33.640 --> 07:36.320
that have almost gotten soaked
three times already!

07:36.560 --> 07:38.080
They cannot get wet!

07:38.560 --> 07:42.039
-Wait! I'm having a brainstorm!
-Uh-oh.

07:42.159 --> 07:45.440
Last time you had a brainstorm,
I got drenched!

07:45.560 --> 07:49.760
Exactly! Ollie, I know
how to catch who's doing this!

07:50.280 --> 07:52.880
Hi, everyone! This is Ollie.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.520
And he absolutely, no-kidding,
cannot get wet today!

08:00.640 --> 08:01.520
Oh...

08:04.039 --> 08:05.320
Uh-oh!

08:11.359 --> 08:13.799
Ha! I've caught you all!

08:13.919 --> 08:14.760
Huh?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.560
[phone rings]

08:18.960 --> 08:21.919
Moon? Ollie? I need to make my soup!

08:22.080 --> 08:23.880
Where are my ingredients?

08:24.000 --> 08:28.080
We tried to get them,
but people kept throwing water on us.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.120
Why, Stanley's Grammie? Why?

08:31.239 --> 08:33.880
<i>Because it's Smigus-Dyngus Day!</i>

08:34.000 --> 08:34.840
Huh?

08:34.959 --> 08:35.799
<i>It's a holiday</i>

08:35.919 --> 08:39.919
when everybody in Kraków
throws water on each other!

08:40.199 --> 08:43.760
So that's what's been going on! But why?

08:43.880 --> 08:47.040
Why do you throw water on each other,
Stanley's Grammie?

08:47.160 --> 08:49.920
<i>For grins and giggles!</i>

08:50.040 --> 08:54.280
Giggles! How... is this... funny?

08:55.040 --> 08:59.079
[laughter]

09:01.199 --> 09:02.640
[grammie chuckles]

09:03.040 --> 09:05.800
Maybe you should give it a try and see?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
[chuckles]

09:08.560 --> 09:10.319
You know, maybe I will.

09:10.480 --> 09:14.920
I mean, I'm already as wet
as I can get! So...

of Grammie's feel-better soup, too!

Thanks, Stanley's Grammie...

10:30.720 --> 10:33.280
Luckily we've brought back
some feel-better soup!

10:33.439 --> 10:36.400
-Here, have some.
-Thanks, Stanley.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.520
You know, Moon,

10:37.640 --> 10:40.199
there's one mystery from our trip
that we never solved.

10:40.319 --> 10:42.920
Is it a case for Moonlock,
Feline Detective?

10:43.040 --> 10:47.120
Yes! It's the mystery
of why this soup is so good!

10:47.240 --> 10:48.680
I can solve that one.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.360
Look!

10:50.600 --> 10:53.199
It's made with Grammie's love.

10:56.199 --> 10:57.040
Aah!

[laughter]
