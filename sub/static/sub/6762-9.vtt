01:45.529 --> 01:48.102
Believe it or not,
that was 90 seconds.

01:48.281 --> 01:52.230
Not a long time by any means,
but certainly long enough

01:52.410 --> 01:57.616
for any garden-variety criminal
to rob your house,

01:57.789 --> 02:00.742
rob you bat-blind.

02:03.419 --> 02:04.960
lt's not my intention to frighten you.

02:05.171 --> 02:10.544
l'm simply trying to point out
that in that same 90 seconds,

02:10.717 --> 02:14.085
an armed guard
from the West Beverly Hills Patrol

02:14.262 --> 02:17.511
would've been at your doorstep.

02:20.101 --> 02:21.808
Before l take any questions,

02:21.977 --> 02:24.218
l would like to thank
our hosts of the evening.

02:24.438 --> 02:26.762
Also,
they are our newest subscribers.

02:27.607 --> 02:30.477
Jack and Candy Welsh.

02:32.862 --> 02:36.610
lt's Walsh. Jim and Cindy Walsh.

02:36.824 --> 02:40.572
So all you do is press those code
numbers into this keypad like this,

02:40.744 --> 02:43.448
and bingo, you're online.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.495
Well, now we can sleep at night.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.451
Don't get me started.
This was your mother's idea.

02:49.001 --> 02:52.037
Oh, and if you need another block
captain for the neighbourhood watch--

02:52.212 --> 02:55.662
Say no more,
we need all the help we can get.

02:55.841 --> 02:57.216
Well, you heard what he said.

02:57.384 --> 02:59.791
l know. Well, that's why
we felt we should become involved.

03:00.011 --> 03:03.426
The Lieberman house was broken into
in broad daylight.

03:03.597 --> 03:07.760
That's horrible.
l don't think we've met the Liebermans.

03:07.976 --> 03:09.173
You haven't missed anything.

03:09.394 --> 03:13.770
But the worst is that Caplan
over at 1 41 0,

03:13.940 --> 03:17.059
with those barking dogs
that he runs off the leash.

03:17.276 --> 03:19.849
- And have you heard the latest?
- No.

03:20.029 --> 03:25.153
Well, the new people have moved
into the old Walker house.

03:25.325 --> 03:26.866
Oh, what are they like?

03:28.745 --> 03:30.536
Oh, you'll see.

04:02.066 --> 04:05.849
All right, he's looking cool,
he's driving cool.

04:06.028 --> 04:09.859
For Steve Sanders,
the world is one huge clam.

04:21.916 --> 04:24.324
Dylan, your mom has been here
for three weeks so far.

04:24.502 --> 04:25.533
Am l ever gonna meet her?

04:25.712 --> 04:30.337
Bren, you gotta trust me.
You do not wanna meet this woman.

04:30.508 --> 04:33.212
Come on,
she cannot be all that weird.

04:33.385 --> 04:35.044
No, of course not, Bren. l mean,

04:35.220 --> 04:40.462
l know everybody's parents listen
to tapes of wind chimes in the car.

04:40.975 --> 04:42.303
Wind chimes?

04:52.569 --> 04:54.027
Good morning, Andrea.

04:54.195 --> 04:56.234
What are you talking about?
lt's a great morning.

04:56.406 --> 04:59.359
l think we have finally found ourselves
a staff photographer.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.857
Told you someone
would come out of the woodwork.

05:02.077 --> 05:04.318
Yeah, well, fortunately for all of us,
somebody did.

05:04.496 --> 05:07.282
- Who?
- Robinson Ashe lll.

05:07.499 --> 05:10.784
Yes, Robinson Ashe lll.
Splendid chap.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.367
Not to be confused
with Robinson Ashe lV, of course.

05:13.546 --> 05:16.665
- Or, for that matter, Robinson Ashe V.
- l don't care what his name is.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.046
He is by far the best photographer
this school has had.

05:19.217 --> 05:22.217
Look at these lifestyle shots
he submitted, Brandon. They're great.

05:22.429 --> 05:24.421
Now, look at this one.

05:27.767 --> 05:28.929
Can he shoot sports?

05:29.101 --> 05:32.434
l don't know, why don't you ask him?
l think he has Tech this period.

05:32.604 --> 05:34.263
What's he like?

05:34.856 --> 05:37.690
Well, actually, l haven't
had the chance to meet him yet.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.650
- Oh, Andrea.
- Please, Brandon?

05:39.861 --> 05:41.900
You are much better
with new people than l am.

05:42.071 --> 05:43.481
You know how intense l get.

05:43.656 --> 05:45.778
Besides, now that
you're on the editorial board,

05:45.949 --> 05:49.317
l think it's time that you started making
some of the tough calls yourself.

05:49.494 --> 05:53.242
Fine. But what if l don't like him?

05:53.456 --> 05:55.163
Why won't you like him?
You like everybody.

05:55.333 --> 06:00.457
l know, but l've never had to deal with
a real, live Robinson Ashe lll before.

06:01.046 --> 06:07.842
Well, if you truly don't like him,
maybe you'll learn to like him.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.172
- Thanks, Andrea.
- Anytime.

06:23.065 --> 06:25.935
- Robinson Ashe, l presume.
- Yo, what can l do for you?

06:28.028 --> 06:29.984
- Oh, you're Robinson.
- You got that right.

06:30.197 --> 06:33.031
Hey, l'm Brandon Walsh, the sports
editor for the West Beverly Blaze.

06:33.241 --> 06:34.818
l hear you're pretty good
with a camera.

06:34.993 --> 06:36.949
Just pretty good?
Or good enough to become

06:37.120 --> 06:40.369
the next staff photographer
of the West Beverly Blaze?

06:41.582 --> 06:42.862
One, two, three.

07:11.984 --> 07:13.940
How's it going, chief?

07:14.778 --> 07:19.071
l don't know, man. lt's a lot tougher
than l expected. A lot tougher.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.909
But, you know,
l think most of it's in focus.

07:22.076 --> 07:26.155
- Well, what's the problem?
- You know, it's hard to say,

07:26.330 --> 07:29.947
but l think the main problem is
you don't know when l'm goofing.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.704
Score for the kid, man.
Look, have no fear.

07:32.877 --> 07:35.248
With me taking the pictures,
your only problem is gonna be,

07:35.421 --> 07:37.128
is choosing which one's
gonna be the best.

07:37.298 --> 07:39.504
That's what l like about you, Ashe.
You're so modest.

07:39.675 --> 07:42.212
And yet so good at everything l do.

07:42.386 --> 07:44.627
Listen, no rush on the film.
Drop it off tomorrow, okay?

07:44.804 --> 07:47.045
All right. Brandon.

07:47.849 --> 07:49.888
Can l ask you a personal favour?

07:50.101 --> 07:52.674
Do you by any chance
live north of Wilshire?

07:52.895 --> 07:54.436
Can l get a ride home
with you today?

07:58.441 --> 08:03.434
Look, man, this is...
lt's pretty tough for me to say, but...

08:03.613 --> 08:05.771
Yeah, hey, man,
if it's not cool, it's not a problem.

08:05.948 --> 08:09.648
No, listen, it is a problem,
and l'll tell you what the problem is.

08:10.243 --> 08:12.484
lt's that you don't know
when l'm goofing.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.785
- You're good, Walsh.
- Yeah, you got that right.

08:16.958 --> 08:20.622
So where exactly do you live,
Robinson Ashe lll?

08:24.089 --> 08:25.464
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

08:25.674 --> 08:27.749
Oh, this is so sweet of you.
Come in.

08:27.967 --> 08:30.006
No, listen,
l know how hectic moving day is.

08:30.178 --> 08:33.095
l don't wanna keep you. l just wanted
to come over and introduce myself.

08:33.264 --> 08:35.220
l'm Cindy Walsh.
We live a few houses down.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.799
l'm Felicity Ashe, and we live here.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.852
l love your house. lt's my favourite
in the whole neighbourhood.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.975
Oh, thank you.
Come back and visit us anytime.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.726
We should have
all the boxes unpacked

08:46.901 --> 08:49.023
sometime between now
and the next five years.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.946
l know the feeling. We moved here
from Minneapolis last summer.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.236
We still got crates in the garage.

08:54.449 --> 08:57.734
Well, l'll tell you what. lf we ever finish
here, l'll come and help you unpack.

08:57.911 --> 08:59.654
- l might take you up on that.
- Do.

08:59.829 --> 09:03.078
But until then, please,
if you need anything, just call.

09:03.249 --> 09:05.324
Thanks. Thanks, Cindy, will do.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.125
Oh, and l hope you don't mind,

09:07.294 --> 09:10.413
but l brought along a pamphlet
from the West Beverly Hills Patrol.

09:10.588 --> 09:13.921
l'm the new block captain
for the neighbourhood watch.

09:14.133 --> 09:17.050
Well, it's not like Beverly Hills has
a major crime problem or anything,

09:17.219 --> 09:19.460
but there have been
some incidents this month.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.838
We heard. ln fact,
my husband thinks it's a good thing

09:22.015 --> 09:24.256
all these break-ins
started before we moved in.

09:26.060 --> 09:29.428
- He was joking, of course.
- Oh, l knew that.

09:35.986 --> 09:39.983
Yeah, l do believe l can get used
to the hills of Beverly real fast.

09:40.156 --> 09:42.777
l don't think
l'll ever get used to this place.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.523
Well, that's because
you never lived in the 'hood.

09:46.996 --> 09:48.703
Must be pretty rough
down there, huh?

09:49.623 --> 09:52.706
Yeah, well,
it can get sticky sometimes.

09:52.876 --> 09:55.710
But, you know,
as long as l can remember,

09:55.879 --> 09:59.627
my pop's been promising my mom
he'd buy a house in Beverly Hills.

10:00.132 --> 10:03.547
You gotta dap him, man.
He came through bigtime.

10:04.303 --> 10:08.252
- What does your father do?
- You ever heard of Poppa's Popcorn?

10:08.473 --> 10:10.880
Yeah, my sister
only lives on the stuff.

10:11.059 --> 10:13.015
Well, that's his company.

10:13.352 --> 10:16.021
Your dad is the Poppa
of Poppa's Popcorn?

10:16.230 --> 10:20.309
Positively finger-popping,
the old-fashioned way.

10:25.446 --> 10:28.363
So you think your papa's
got some free samples lying around

10:28.532 --> 10:29.990
for all his hungry new neighbours?

10:30.159 --> 10:33.242
From what l can tell, papa
might have a lifetime supply for you

10:33.453 --> 10:36.026
if you can let his son ride to school
with you in the mornings.

10:37.082 --> 10:39.916
Yeah, l think that can probably
be arranged, once in a while.

10:40.126 --> 10:43.126
All right.
Then you want the extra light,

10:43.295 --> 10:46.745
super crispy,
or new and improved Cajun spicy?

10:46.924 --> 10:49.924
- Surprise me.
- Cool.

10:50.885 --> 10:54.467
- Catch you later, then, neighbour.
- All right, man. Go easy.

11:06.483 --> 11:08.060
- Look what you did.
- Look what l did?

11:08.234 --> 11:10.392
What, are you insane?
You rammed into me.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.772
- This is a brand-new car.
- Yeah, well, this is a classic car.

11:14.281 --> 11:15.739
- Give me your licence.
- No.

11:15.908 --> 11:18.232
What do you mean?
We had an accident, we gotta report it.

11:18.451 --> 11:20.609
l don't have to do nothing
till l talk to my father,

11:20.787 --> 11:22.328
who's gonna put your head
on a platter

11:22.497 --> 11:24.288
and serve it to his lawyers
for breakfast.

11:24.498 --> 11:26.656
My father's no slouch.
By the time we finish with you,

11:26.834 --> 11:29.158
you'll wish you never
graduated from driver's training.

11:29.378 --> 11:31.536
- We'll see.
- Yeah, we'll see.

11:31.755 --> 11:33.414
l can't believe what l'm hearing here.

11:33.632 --> 11:36.087
Why should l have to pay
for something that wasn't my fault?

11:36.259 --> 11:38.417
Brandon, l already told you.
l will pay for it.

11:38.594 --> 11:40.052
lt's a non-issue, so let's drop it.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.964
But there's a principle
involved here, Dad.

11:42.139 --> 11:45.887
What's involved here is a minor
accident where no one was injured.

11:46.059 --> 11:48.763
So let's walk away from it
with our heads held high

11:48.937 --> 11:50.680
and our insurance premiums intact.

11:50.855 --> 11:54.519
Fine, why don't we roll over with our
tails between our legs while we're at it?

11:54.692 --> 11:56.898
- He's your son. You talk to him.
- Dad, wa--

11:57.111 --> 12:01.819
Brandon, look. Even if it is her fault,
and l'm sure it was,

12:01.990 --> 12:05.488
l mean, this is not the kind of message
l wanna be sending to these people.

12:05.660 --> 12:07.070
Honey, we lived here for two months

12:07.245 --> 12:09.818
before anybody on the block
even deigned to talk to us.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.368
That's probably because
we're from Minnesota.

12:12.541 --> 12:15.707
Very funny, Brenda. But
the fact is they're our neighbours now.

12:15.877 --> 12:17.418
We have to try
to get along with them.

12:17.587 --> 12:19.378
We have to learn to live with them.

12:19.547 --> 12:20.791
- But--
- Brandon, l'm sorry.

12:20.965 --> 12:23.289
That's the way l feel,
and that's the way it's gonna be.

12:25.844 --> 12:28.334
You know why
they're doing this, don't you?

12:28.513 --> 12:31.050
Yeah. For free popcorn.

12:31.891 --> 12:33.385
You know, the worst part about it is

12:33.560 --> 12:35.599
that girl's gotta be gloating
right about now.

12:35.812 --> 12:39.476
- But, Daddy, it was his fault.
- l sincerely doubt that,

12:39.648 --> 12:41.439
the way you drive
like a bat out of hell.

12:41.608 --> 12:44.893
- l told you not to buy her a sports car.
- This is an A and B conversation.

12:45.070 --> 12:47.739
- C your way out of it, please.
- Robbie, hush.

12:47.906 --> 12:49.779
l'll call the insurance company
in the morning.

12:49.949 --> 12:51.526
lf you won't sue him, Daddy, l will.

12:51.701 --> 12:54.156
Look here, Charise.
We didn't move to Beverly Hills

12:54.328 --> 12:56.154
so you could make
a spectacle of yourself.

12:56.371 --> 12:59.739
Right, we moved here so we all could
become a whiter shade of pale.

12:59.916 --> 13:02.750
Charise, that is cruel and untrue.

13:02.961 --> 13:04.502
What am l supposed
to say in lnglewood

13:04.670 --> 13:05.914
when they ask why we moved out?

13:06.088 --> 13:07.332
How about telling the truth?

13:07.548 --> 13:09.706
How about telling that one
of the reasons we moved out

13:09.883 --> 13:13.216
was to put as many miles between you
and that Devo Damars character?

13:13.386 --> 13:15.757
With whom l know
you're still hanging about.

13:15.930 --> 13:16.961
Busted.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.630
Shrimp, you working
my last nerve, okay?

13:19.809 --> 13:22.264
So why don't you take that last nerve
over to the Walshes,

13:22.436 --> 13:26.302
tell that young man that your father
insists on paying for the damages?

13:26.481 --> 13:29.896
- But, Daddy--
- No buts. Just go.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.151
My papa told me to talk to you.

13:42.370 --> 13:44.113
Yeah, well, mine told me
to talk to you.

13:44.789 --> 13:47.410
- So talk.
- You first.

13:49.001 --> 13:52.701
My father insists
on paying for everything.

13:53.630 --> 13:54.709
So does mine.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.091
Well, if your father's
anything like mine,

13:59.260 --> 14:02.758
l just might have to be nice to you,
out of pity.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.051
Don't do me any favours.

14:04.223 --> 14:06.381
lf it were up to me,
we would be having an appointment

14:06.558 --> 14:08.349
with Judge Wapner
and The People's Court.

14:09.728 --> 14:11.969
- Judge Wapner?
- Yes.

14:14.107 --> 14:16.776
- l'm Brandon.
- l'm Charise.

14:16.984 --> 14:20.186
- Welcome to Beverly Hills, Charise.
- Thank you, Brandon.

14:20.362 --> 14:24.489
Tell me, does everyone in Beverly Hills
drive like a raving lunatic?

14:24.699 --> 14:26.157
No, just you.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.501
- Jim, Jim.
- Cindy.

14:45.676 --> 14:46.790
Call the security patrol.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.379
- Cindy.
- Call them.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.878
lt's probably Brandon.

14:52.307 --> 14:55.390
Hey, Mom,
what's the keypad number?

14:57.478 --> 14:59.553
This is a very loud way
to wake up in the morning!

14:59.730 --> 15:02.564
l know, l'm sorry. l just wanted to go
for a bike ride before school.

15:02.733 --> 15:05.899
lf you'd paid attention the other night
instead of clowning with your sister,

15:06.069 --> 15:07.479
you'd know how to turn this off.

15:07.654 --> 15:09.278
l thought the number was 251 4.

15:09.447 --> 15:12.780
- lt is 251 4.
- Well, that's the number l punched in.

15:15.327 --> 15:17.948
Mom, how come
nothing's happening?

15:23.543 --> 15:27.291
l'm sorry, l still don't quite see why
we can't turn the alarm off directly.

15:27.463 --> 15:30.463
- Nice work, champ.
- Hey, all l did was open the door.

15:30.674 --> 15:32.547
- Oh, sure, Brandon.
- Here, here, let me try.

15:32.718 --> 15:34.591
Just a minute, hold on a second.

15:34.761 --> 15:38.509
Hello? No, Mrs. Cooper.
No, there's nothing to worry about.

15:38.723 --> 15:40.845
l have the security police
on the other line.

15:41.017 --> 15:44.467
No, nothing's wrong,
the alarm just seems to be stuck.

15:48.106 --> 15:49.730
- Thank you, thank you.
- Dad.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.106
For my next trick,
l will pull a rabbit out of a hat.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.853
No, do the one where you make
Mrs. Cooper disappear.

15:56.322 --> 15:59.026
Yes. No, Mrs. Cooper.

15:59.825 --> 16:02.066
Hey, it may be funny now,
but l'm telling you,

16:02.244 --> 16:05.280
before you guys came downstairs,
Mom was borderline touch-and-go.

16:05.455 --> 16:08.574
Brandon, Mom may be a little crazed
about all these burglaries,

16:08.750 --> 16:10.658
but she's definitely
not wigging on us.

16:10.835 --> 16:14.832
No, l didn't say that.
She's just stressed, that's all.

16:20.010 --> 16:23.295
- Oh, my God.
- l don't believe this.

16:23.471 --> 16:27.550
Charise, babe,
you gotta settle down,

16:27.725 --> 16:30.215
or you're gonna die behind the wheel
and take me out with you.

16:30.436 --> 16:33.436
- Sorry, Brandon, l didn't see you.
- That's because you weren't looking.

16:33.605 --> 16:35.929
You're right.
lt's just that l'm late for school.

16:36.107 --> 16:39.522
Where do you go, USC or the Mario
Andretti School of Unsafe Driving?

16:39.735 --> 16:41.478
Brandon, l'm still in high school.

16:42.071 --> 16:45.404
lf you go to West Beverly, how come
l'm driving your brother to school?

16:45.616 --> 16:47.608
- Because l go to Baldwin.
- Where's that?

16:47.784 --> 16:49.491
Near where we used to live.

16:50.328 --> 16:52.735
- Long way to drive, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

16:52.914 --> 16:54.870
- So nice talking to you.
- Wait a second.

16:55.541 --> 16:57.165
Why don't you go to West Beverly?

16:58.961 --> 17:02.376
''l wouldn't go to West Beverly
if it was the last hellhole in the galawy.

17:02.547 --> 17:04.338
Too many cashed-up snobs.''

17:04.507 --> 17:07.211
And you should've heard the way
she dissed on everybody at Beverly.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.252
l can relate to that one.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.336
lt's not what she said,
it's how she said it.

17:11.512 --> 17:14.714
This is coming from a girl who's driving
around in a brand-new convertible.

17:14.891 --> 17:17.560
Courtesy of her papa, the Poppa.

17:17.727 --> 17:20.263
- ''Positively finger-popping''?
- The same.

17:20.438 --> 17:22.310
We're talking beaucoup bucks here.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.888
Princesses come
in all shapes and sizes.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.644
And colours.

17:27.486 --> 17:29.145
But you say
that she's a good student?

17:29.321 --> 17:32.155
According to Robbie, she complains
her classes aren't hard enough.

17:32.324 --> 17:34.993
Here she has a chance to go
to a great school and she trashes it.

17:35.159 --> 17:37.945
That is exactly what interests me
about her story.

17:38.954 --> 17:39.985
What story?

17:42.040 --> 17:45.373
Brandon, here l am
lying through my teeth

17:45.544 --> 17:47.335
about living in-district
so l can come here,

17:47.504 --> 17:49.911
and she's driving halfway
across the universe to avoid it.

17:50.131 --> 17:51.245
What story?

17:51.924 --> 17:55.921
No, there's a story lurking there.
l'm just not quite sure what it is yet.

17:56.136 --> 17:59.136
When you find it, ace,
you be sure and let me know.

17:59.306 --> 18:02.472
Brandon, all l'm asking you to do
is have a simple conversation with her.

18:02.684 --> 18:05.684
l'd have to talk to her, which is not
something l wanna rush back into.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.644
And believe me,
the feeling is very mutual.

18:07.855 --> 18:09.396
Why don't you ask Robbie
to help you?

18:09.607 --> 18:11.148
l'm sure he'd love that.

18:11.358 --> 18:17.691
Look, if he truly wants to be the next
staff photographer, he'll help you.

18:26.913 --> 18:28.407
Why is it that every time l look up,

18:28.582 --> 18:31.499
that Robbie kid has a telephoto lens
pointed at me?

18:31.668 --> 18:34.289
Yeah, just what this campus needs,
paparazzi.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.077
You know, he kind of reminds me
of David Silver.

18:37.256 --> 18:39.248
l mean, except he's black.

18:40.676 --> 18:42.335
l didn't know David Silver was black.

18:43.303 --> 18:44.334
Shut up.

18:44.554 --> 18:48.052
l don't know, but l think Brandon
has a thing for his older sister.

18:50.476 --> 18:52.053
Mr. Ashe. How you doing today?

18:52.228 --> 18:53.342
Good timing, Walsh.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.512
l just framed your twin sister
for a prizewinner.

18:55.689 --> 18:57.597
Speaking of sisters,

18:58.817 --> 19:04.107
this is gonna sound kind of weird, but
Andrea wants me to interview yours.

19:04.405 --> 19:06.397
- lnterview Charise?
- lf it's all right with you.

19:06.574 --> 19:08.732
No, l have no problem
with the concept, man.

19:08.909 --> 19:12.609
lt's just that
it's Charise you gotta worry about.

19:12.787 --> 19:14.446
Why's that?

19:14.622 --> 19:17.705
- You really want the truth?
- Always.

19:18.417 --> 19:20.907
You see,
it may be different with you,

19:21.086 --> 19:25.379
but the truth is Charise really
isn't that crazy about white people.

19:28.176 --> 19:29.717
Wonderful.

19:45.274 --> 19:47.480
- Tamale Heaven.
- Ramon, it's me.

19:47.651 --> 19:49.477
- Can l speak to him?
- Sure thing, love.

19:50.362 --> 19:55.106
- Devo, it's Popcorn.
- Tell her l'm busy.

19:57.327 --> 20:01.406
- He'll be right with you.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

20:02.373 --> 20:05.492
- Mom, you look terrific.
- Oh, thank you.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.620
Robbie, l just left you a note.
You're on your own for dinner tonight.

20:08.837 --> 20:10.496
Being honoured
by the Chamber of Commerce.

20:10.672 --> 20:12.664
But, Mom,
l invited Brandon over to eat with us.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.002
So you're Brandon.

20:14.175 --> 20:16.416
Robbie and Reesie
have had plenty to say about you.

20:16.594 --> 20:19.167
Well, then half of what you heard
is probably true.

20:19.388 --> 20:20.965
Okay, we won't be late.

20:21.723 --> 20:23.845
- Say hi to your mom for me, okay?
- Will do.

20:24.017 --> 20:27.053
Mom, is there anything to eat
besides you-know-what?

20:28.438 --> 20:30.513
Maybe Brandon would like to try
our Cajun light.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.225
- Oh, Mom.
- What?

20:32.399 --> 20:33.727
Won't be in the store for months.

20:33.901 --> 20:35.359
- lt would be my pleasure.
- Good.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.313
You tell me what you think.
All right, goodbye, everyone.

20:38.989 --> 20:42.357
l swear, that woman tries to turn
all my friends into guinea pigs.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.192
So feed me.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.412
Don't you wanna see me?

20:49.623 --> 20:51.117
Look, you know l do.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.330
Why do you want me
to come way up to Beverly Hills?

20:53.501 --> 20:56.999
- So your old man can kill me?
- He can't kill what he can't see.

20:57.171 --> 20:58.629
They're not coming back till late.

20:58.798 --> 21:01.122
We could practically
spend the whole night together.

21:01.342 --> 21:04.093
Well, look, l gotta close up here
tonight, you know what l'm saying?

21:04.261 --> 21:05.968
What about later?

21:06.888 --> 21:09.129
l just think l should lay low because,
you know,

21:09.349 --> 21:10.629
with my brothers in town,

21:10.808 --> 21:12.847
they might be trying to run
some mind games on Mom.

21:13.019 --> 21:14.513
You know what l'm saying?

21:14.687 --> 21:16.595
lt's always something with you,
isn't it, Devo?

21:16.814 --> 21:19.055
- Charise--
- lf you wanna break up, that's fine.

21:19.232 --> 21:21.438
Just don't use Beverly Hills
as your excuse.

21:21.651 --> 21:22.813
Come on, now, Charise.

21:23.027 --> 21:25.019
l can take a hint.

21:27.073 --> 21:28.614
Sucker.

21:30.284 --> 21:32.157
How long
have you been standing there?

21:32.369 --> 21:34.990
l was just waiting for Robbie
to bring out the popcorn.

21:35.205 --> 21:37.695
And eavesdropping
on my private conversation?

21:37.916 --> 21:40.038
No, l wasn't. Not really.

21:40.209 --> 21:41.667
All l know is you have a boyfriend

21:41.836 --> 21:43.958
who detests Beverly Hills
about as much as you do.

21:44.129 --> 21:46.002
First of all, l don't have a boyfriend.

21:46.173 --> 21:48.877
And second of all,
l don't detest Beverly Hills.

21:49.092 --> 21:51.843
Oh, that's right. What was it
you said to me this morning?

21:52.011 --> 21:57.514
''FYl, Brandon,
Beverly Hills ain't heaven on earth.''

21:57.683 --> 21:59.260
What was that about, Reesie?

21:59.476 --> 22:01.764
lt was about
putting you on the defensive.

22:01.937 --> 22:04.225
And don't ever call me Reesie.

22:05.607 --> 22:06.638
You are brutal.

22:07.483 --> 22:11.811
- Sorry about that.
- Well, you should be. l'm a nice guy.

22:12.905 --> 22:15.360
No, really, l am.
My mom told me so.

22:15.866 --> 22:17.146
What else did she tell you?

22:17.367 --> 22:19.822
She told me to look both ways
before crossing the street

22:19.994 --> 22:21.404
and always be polite to the ladies.

22:21.579 --> 22:24.912
- ln all shades and colours?
- Never stopped me before.

22:30.337 --> 22:32.245
Hey, look,
l couldn't find the Cajun spicy,

22:32.422 --> 22:34.213
so l cooked us up some extra crispy.

22:34.382 --> 22:37.051
Thanks, but there's been
a slight change of plans.

22:37.218 --> 22:39.340
l'm gonna take your sister out
to eat tonight.

22:39.512 --> 22:43.260
- She agreed to be interviewed?
- Well, actually, l didn't bring it up.

22:43.432 --> 22:46.101
l figured we'd get to know each other
first and see what happens.

22:46.268 --> 22:51.143
- lf it's all right with you.
- Yeah, sure. lt's cool with me.

22:52.190 --> 22:54.727
l got two cousins
working in Beverly Hills.

22:54.900 --> 23:00.238
Same house, different wings.
Wings, man.

23:00.739 --> 23:04.652
The house is so big, they gotta fly
from one end to the other.

23:05.660 --> 23:09.573
Oh, l crack me up. ''Fly.''

23:09.914 --> 23:13.662
Go see your girl, man.
l got you covered.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.583
You think
l should give her a call, man?

23:16.086 --> 23:18.872
- A call?
- Yeah. Yo, come on, man.

23:19.047 --> 23:21.751
Devo, where's your
sense of romance, homey?

23:21.924 --> 23:23.999
What she wants is for you
to show up at her doorstep

23:24.176 --> 23:27.295
with flowers
and some strawberry yogurt.

23:28.305 --> 23:30.297
So talk to me,
you gonna lend me your ride?

23:30.473 --> 23:31.967
Now you're talking.

23:32.142 --> 23:34.846
- But you gotta change that shirt.
- Well, what's up?

23:35.061 --> 23:38.844
You're going to Beverly Hills.
A green one, for money.

23:43.693 --> 23:45.103
- This is Charise.
- Hi.

23:45.278 --> 23:51.232
- This is David, Donna and Dylan.
- You can just call us the Three D's.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.277
l don't think so.

23:53.452 --> 23:55.740
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Charise.

23:55.954 --> 23:57.780
This is my sister, Brenda.

23:57.956 --> 24:00.162
She was in the car
you tried to take out this morning.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.167
- Sorry about that.
- lt's okay. l like what you're wearing.

24:03.377 --> 24:06.330
- Thanks.
- And l love the way you wear it.

24:06.547 --> 24:07.957
l'm Steve Sanders,

24:08.173 --> 24:10.379
and you're definitely
better-looking than your brother.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.341
l hope so.

24:13.178 --> 24:15.585
- And this is Kelly.
- Hi.

24:15.805 --> 24:18.093
- l love what you're wearing.
- Thank you.

24:18.266 --> 24:19.297
You wanna sit down?

24:21.852 --> 24:25.469
This is very hip, Brandon. Very hip.

24:28.483 --> 24:30.973
Two-seven-three? No, 27 4?

24:31.152 --> 24:35.101
Operator, yeah, just give me
Robinson Ashe in Beverly Hills.

24:35.281 --> 24:38.815
While you're at it, let me have
an exact address. lt's a new listing.

24:39.243 --> 24:42.860
What? lt's not listed?
Well, that figures.

24:43.038 --> 24:44.579
l mean,
l should've known this old man

24:44.747 --> 24:47.118
wasn't gonna have his digits
in the phone book.

24:47.375 --> 24:50.328
No, no, it's okay.
l'm just gonna have to wing it.

24:53.672 --> 24:56.957
My husband must have
accidentally set it off.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.840
We don't know why.

24:59.010 --> 25:02.129
We don't know why we ever installed
this damn thing in the first place.

25:02.305 --> 25:03.846
What was that, Mrs. Cooper?

25:04.014 --> 25:07.429
Oh, no, you didn't have to call
the security patrol.

25:07.601 --> 25:08.632
She did what?

25:08.852 --> 25:11.521
Oh, it's okay, honey,
it was not because of us.

25:11.688 --> 25:13.763
lt's because Mr. Caplan's dogs
are barking too loud.

25:13.940 --> 25:17.688
Oh, of course, the dogs.
l can really hear them barking.

25:18.861 --> 25:20.769
Jim.

25:23.115 --> 25:26.198
Honey, way to go.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.535
Mrs. Cooper, l have to go now.

25:37.252 --> 25:38.662
Get out of here.

25:45.676 --> 25:47.051
Hey!

25:47.803 --> 25:49.297
Hold it.

25:50.556 --> 25:51.966
Don't you like animals, kid?

25:52.140 --> 25:53.634
Well, l can take them or leave them,

25:53.808 --> 25:56.381
but l work at this tamale stand,
so they must smell the meat.

25:56.561 --> 25:59.230
- Where are you going so fast?
- l'm going to see my girlfriend.

25:59.397 --> 26:01.389
- What's her address?
- Lives on Hillcrest Drive.

26:01.565 --> 26:04.435
l don't know the exact address.
Her name is Ashe.

26:04.610 --> 26:06.068
You better call B.H.P.D.

26:06.236 --> 26:07.943
Have them come
check out our friend here.

26:08.113 --> 26:09.523
Give me a break.
What you gonna do?

26:09.697 --> 26:12.483
Are you gonna arrest me
for walking on a public street?

26:12.658 --> 26:14.816
- What's in the bag?
- Yogurt.

26:14.994 --> 26:17.531
- Keep your hands to the side.
- Well, check it out.

26:17.746 --> 26:20.415
Hey, hey,
get your hands off me, man!

26:22.792 --> 26:24.784
You responsible
for all those burglaries, my man?

26:24.961 --> 26:26.704
What burglaries, man?
l ain't done nothing.

26:26.879 --> 26:28.123
Shut up.

26:31.008 --> 26:33.083
Just give me a reason.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.299
Robbie called
when you were in the shower.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.514
- His mom's gonna take him to school.
- Oh, okay.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.843
You know, l really liked Charise.
Everybody did.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.182
Do you think she liked us?

26:46.355 --> 26:49.972
Yeah, she even liked Steve.
l think it's me she didn't like.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.640
Oh, she wouldn't let you
kiss her good night, huh?

26:53.194 --> 26:54.356
l think she has a boyfriend.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.066
- Oh, that's a different story.
- Yeah, it is.

26:57.281 --> 26:58.609
Terrible. That's terrible.

26:58.782 --> 27:01.948
When did the police leave?
Well, was anyone else injured?

27:02.119 --> 27:03.613
What happened?

27:03.787 --> 27:05.743
Your mother's speaking
to Mrs. Cooper right now,

27:05.914 --> 27:07.573
so l don't know
how viable any of this is,

27:07.749 --> 27:10.832
but apparently there was a prowler
outside the Ashe home last night.

27:11.002 --> 27:12.745
Turned out to be
a friend of the daughter's,

27:12.920 --> 27:14.295
the crazy one with the sports car.

27:14.505 --> 27:17.458
Yeah, l know who she is, Dad.
l took her out last night.

27:17.674 --> 27:20.211
- You did?
- Yeah.

27:20.385 --> 27:21.713
ls there a problem with that?

27:21.928 --> 27:26.221
- No, no. l'm just surprised, that's all.
- Why?

27:28.809 --> 27:34.015
Well, because two days ago,
you were ready to drag her into court.

27:34.189 --> 27:36.347
Anyway, can you guys
just tell me what happened?

27:36.566 --> 27:39.317
What happened is the security
was called and all hell broke loose.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.104
This is a real mess.

27:44.364 --> 27:45.395
Morning.

27:46.658 --> 27:49.195
Yo, didn't Brenda tell you?
My mom's taking me to school today.

27:49.411 --> 27:50.442
Oh, yeah, she told me.

27:50.620 --> 27:53.075
We just heard about what
went down with the security patrol.

27:53.247 --> 27:57.078
Oh, well, that.
lt's not a big thing, you know that.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.410
Well, my mom didn't know all
the details, but didn't the cops come?

28:02.380 --> 28:04.455
You know, to tell the truth,
l really don't know.

28:04.632 --> 28:05.711
l was sleeping, mostly.

28:05.883 --> 28:07.460
You must be
a pretty heavy sleeper, pal.

28:07.677 --> 28:10.381
- Wasn't there a squad car--?
- Like l said, l really don't know.

28:10.554 --> 28:13.471
Why don't we just forget about it,
you know what l'm saying?

28:14.891 --> 28:16.301
Oh, hold on a second, man.

28:17.602 --> 28:20.436
- How's Charise doing?
- l guess she's doing okay.

28:20.605 --> 28:22.513
Look, l gotta go. l'll catch you later.

28:22.690 --> 28:24.184
- All right.
- Okay.

28:27.152 --> 28:29.440
We have rules in this house,
young lady.

28:30.864 --> 28:34.481
There are rules in this house,
and you broke them all.

28:34.784 --> 28:37.867
How many times have we specifically
told you to stop seeing Devo Damars?

28:38.037 --> 28:40.076
l wasn't even here
when it happened, Daddy.

28:40.914 --> 28:42.158
What are you trying to sell me?

28:42.791 --> 28:44.747
That this was some
random coincidence?

28:46.002 --> 28:49.584
That that no-class bum
gets himself into a fight with the police

28:49.756 --> 28:52.839
in front of our house
while you're off gallivanting?

28:53.008 --> 28:55.463
We went out to get a hamburger.
You got a problem with that?

28:55.636 --> 28:57.379
You'd like Brandon, honey.

28:58.597 --> 29:02.463
Yeah, maybe l would.

29:04.310 --> 29:08.058
But what l don't like is being lied to.

29:09.064 --> 29:11.733
What l don't like is my daughter

29:11.900 --> 29:14.355
sneaking around
with a high school dropout.

29:14.527 --> 29:15.902
What am l supposed to do?

29:16.070 --> 29:18.477
You set the rules,
you tell me l can't go out with this one.

29:18.656 --> 29:20.315
You tell me
l can't go out with that one.

29:20.491 --> 29:22.198
Black, white,
it doesn't make a difference.

29:22.368 --> 29:23.743
No one's ever good enough for you.

29:23.911 --> 29:25.903
That's enough
out of your smart mouth, young lady.

29:26.079 --> 29:27.276
None of this would've happened

29:27.456 --> 29:29.946
if you didn't invite that thug here
in the first place.

29:32.668 --> 29:33.996
What are the neighbours
gonna say?

29:34.170 --> 29:36.494
Who cares
what the neighbours think?

29:37.131 --> 29:38.162
l care.

29:39.508 --> 29:41.963
Your mother and l didn't work
all these years

29:42.177 --> 29:46.221
to buy a house in Beverly Hills so that
we would be put under a microscope.

29:52.102 --> 29:57.973
Look, Charise, if l am hard on you,
it's because l love you.

30:01.319 --> 30:04.153
Well, l'm sure
this will all blow over soon.

30:04.321 --> 30:07.155
By this time tomorrow, the whole thing
will be forgotten forever.

30:14.122 --> 30:15.402
Hey, buddy.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.537
Hey, Steve-o, hey, Kellster.
What's happening?

30:17.708 --> 30:19.783
Why don't you tell us?

30:20.377 --> 30:22.452
We were just wondering
what happened last night.

30:22.629 --> 30:24.087
l wish l knew.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.126
The PR guy at the police department
gave me the runaround all morning.

30:27.300 --> 30:30.134
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

30:30.303 --> 30:32.176
- Charise.
- What about Charise?

30:32.346 --> 30:36.046
We just were wondering
if there's any jungle fever happening.

30:36.225 --> 30:39.807
You know, you two really ought to
consider getting back together again.

30:40.061 --> 30:41.140
What's his problem?

30:41.730 --> 30:43.389
Look, l know
you're a guy with a mission,

30:43.564 --> 30:45.770
but l can't put the paper to bed
without a sports page.

30:45.942 --> 30:48.349
Yeah, sorry. l'll put it together.

30:49.361 --> 30:50.855
The police won't release any details,

30:51.029 --> 30:53.602
because it turns out
the guy wasn't actually arrested.

30:53.782 --> 30:55.774
lf he wasn't arrested,
what's the story?

30:55.950 --> 30:57.693
What's the story? The story is

30:57.869 --> 31:00.655
a young black guy gets detained
and harassed on a public street

31:00.830 --> 31:03.237
for no apparent reason
other than the colour of his skin

31:03.415 --> 31:04.790
and nobody wants to talk about it.

31:04.958 --> 31:08.291
Wait a minute, wait,
what are you saying?

31:08.461 --> 31:10.120
That there's a cover-up
going on here?

31:10.296 --> 31:11.540
No, all l'm saying

31:11.714 --> 31:15.082
is that some of these private
security guards are like loose cannons.

31:15.259 --> 31:17.796
Who are they
accountable to, anyway?

31:18.554 --> 31:21.305
l think you better talk
to the guy they stopped.

31:21.473 --> 31:23.928
First l gotta find out his name.

31:24.309 --> 31:25.719
That would help.

31:27.562 --> 31:28.593
Hey, Robbie.

31:28.771 --> 31:31.142
l've been looking for you, man.
You weren't in Tech class.

31:31.315 --> 31:33.722
- l came in a little late this morning.
- Hey, listen,

31:33.901 --> 31:35.644
l was hoping maybe
you could help me out.

31:35.819 --> 31:38.570
Do you know Charise's friend,
the one that got hassled?

31:38.738 --> 31:40.813
- Yeah.
- Well, what's his name?

31:40.990 --> 31:42.649
l thought we were gonna
forget about that.

31:42.825 --> 31:45.908
- And pretend nothing happened?
- Sounds like a plan to me.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.153
Robbie, l need to interview this guy.

31:48.330 --> 31:50.867
l'd like it if you could tell me
how to get in touch with him.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.321
Now, come on, Brandon.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.539
Why are you gonna make this thing
worse than it is?

31:54.711 --> 31:56.418
My parents are steamed up enough,
you know.

31:56.587 --> 31:58.793
l know, but the truth is
this isn't about your parents.

31:58.964 --> 32:01.537
This is about breaking a news story.

32:01.717 --> 32:03.543
lf you wanna be
our new staff photographer,

32:03.719 --> 32:06.174
l suggest you find a way
to help me out here.

32:06.346 --> 32:08.753
Well, if you put it that way,

32:08.932 --> 32:11.173
l strongly suggest
you find yourself a new photographer.

32:11.350 --> 32:12.891
Hey, come on, man.
What's your problem?

32:13.060 --> 32:16.475
My problem is you, man.
You are a user, and l'm sick of it.

32:16.647 --> 32:18.473
You blatantly used me
to get to my sister.

32:18.648 --> 32:20.189
- No, that's not true.
- Yes, it is.

32:20.358 --> 32:21.852
You use every opportunity
you can find

32:22.026 --> 32:24.563
to make me painfully aware that
when you look at me,

32:24.737 --> 32:26.278
you don't see
the new kid on the block,

32:26.447 --> 32:28.439
you see the new black kid
on the block.

32:28.616 --> 32:30.572
And l hate to tell you this,
but in my eyes,

32:30.743 --> 32:32.901
that doesn't make you
a whole hell of a lot different

32:33.078 --> 32:35.284
than those dudes
on the security patrol.

32:36.289 --> 32:37.913
The guy
practically called me a racist.

32:38.082 --> 32:40.833
And he did call me a user.
lt's bogus, man.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.041
lt's pure BS.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.713
What? You think l use people?
You think l'm a racist?

32:49.259 --> 32:51.796
No, Brandon, of course not.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.175
You promise you won't get mad?

32:56.182 --> 32:57.592
Go on.

32:57.766 --> 33:01.430
lf you didn't think there was a
kernel of truth to what he was saying,

33:01.603 --> 33:04.354
you probably wouldn't be so angry.

33:21.746 --> 33:24.616
Charise, you got a minute?

33:24.790 --> 33:27.114
ls this off the record
or on the record?

33:28.043 --> 33:29.999
l guess Robbie told you
about the article, huh?

33:30.212 --> 33:31.540
The moment l got home last night.

33:31.713 --> 33:33.420
Right after he told me
Devo got busted.

33:33.631 --> 33:36.038
- l'm sorry, l should've said so--
- Yeah, you should've.

33:36.217 --> 33:39.051
l should've known better than to go out
with a boy from Beverly Hills.

33:39.261 --> 33:41.632
When l asked you out,
l didn't ask you out as a reporter.

33:41.805 --> 33:43.346
l asked you out as a friend.

33:43.557 --> 33:45.798
Or at least someone who wanted
to become your friend.

33:45.976 --> 33:48.383
Yeah, well, if you truly
wanna become my friend,

33:48.561 --> 33:51.929
get out of here before my papa
grounds me for another month.

33:52.148 --> 33:53.310
Charise...

33:56.527 --> 33:57.855
That damn alarm.

33:58.028 --> 34:00.150
You better rush home
and call the security patrol.

34:00.322 --> 34:02.991
For all you know, a Negro
might be breaking into your house.

34:03.199 --> 34:06.116
Okay, okay, fine.
You win. l'm the bad guy.

34:06.285 --> 34:09.618
l'm the biggest bastard
in the history of Beverly Hills, all right?

34:09.788 --> 34:12.954
You can say or think anything
you want about me. l don't care.

34:13.125 --> 34:17.252
But what happened to your friend Devo
on this street last night was wrong.

34:17.420 --> 34:18.914
Now, l wanna write a story about it,

34:19.088 --> 34:21.839
but l need you to tell me
how l can get in touch with him.

34:23.342 --> 34:25.215
Go home, Brandon.

34:29.054 --> 34:32.138
Mrs. Cooper-- Mrs. Cooper,
you're not listening to me.

34:32.308 --> 34:35.806
There is no need to call the security
patrol, because they're already here.

34:35.978 --> 34:37.601
Yes, yes, they're in the other room,

34:37.771 --> 34:40.226
trying to locate
what keeps setting this thing off.

34:40.399 --> 34:42.806
lf you and Dad
don't disconnect that thing, l will.

34:42.984 --> 34:45.556
lt's embarrassing, Mom. lt really is.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.984
Yes, yes, Mrs. Cooper. l'm still here.

34:51.659 --> 34:52.902
Do you have any earplugs?

34:53.077 --> 34:55.862
Really. And you know
the irony of all this?

34:56.038 --> 34:59.038
That Charise's friend probably
wouldn't have even been hassled

34:59.207 --> 35:03.334
if the security patrol had not
come here to answer our false alarm.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.578
lt's about time.

35:07.131 --> 35:11.424
This kind of thing never happens.
We're replacing all the circuits.

35:11.593 --> 35:14.593
- Clearly, something's defective.
- Clearly.

35:14.762 --> 35:16.968
Listen, you and your family
have all been very patient.

35:17.140 --> 35:19.132
l appreciate it, okay?
Anything l can do for you--

35:19.308 --> 35:22.308
Actually, maybe there is something
you could do.

35:22.478 --> 35:26.689
When your security officers detain
someone, do they fill out a report?

35:26.856 --> 35:28.599
Sure, yeah.

35:30.652 --> 35:35.112
- Hey. Where are you going so fast?
- Tamale Heaven.

35:35.281 --> 35:37.154
- Sounds delish.
- l'll let you know.

35:37.324 --> 35:39.150
Hey, is it that the new place
on Charleville?

35:39.326 --> 35:41.318
- No, it's south.
- Where?

35:41.494 --> 35:44.613
lt's south, it's somewhere between
Watts and the airport, l think.

35:44.789 --> 35:46.330
Why are you going there?

35:46.499 --> 35:49.452
lt's where Charise's boyfriend works.
l wanna get an interview with him.

35:49.627 --> 35:52.710
This is gonna sound kind of beat,
but is it safe to go there by yourself?

35:52.879 --> 35:53.958
- We'll see.
- Brandon.

35:54.131 --> 35:56.289
l know you love playing
Woodward and Bernstein,

35:56.466 --> 35:58.209
but l think
you're way over your head here.

35:58.384 --> 36:00.008
- Thanks.
- Brandon--

36:00.219 --> 36:02.045
Stay out of it.
lt's got nothing to do with you.

36:02.263 --> 36:03.638
Fine, just go.

37:06.361 --> 37:08.649
What's up, fellas?

37:08.947 --> 37:11.568
So, what are we
trying to accomplish here?

37:11.908 --> 37:15.656
Didn't Ramon warn y'all
about mashing headgear around here?

37:15.869 --> 37:16.900
Your posse know what's up.

37:17.079 --> 37:19.320
Y'all keep this up,
you're gonna get busted.

37:19.915 --> 37:23.283
lf you're packing or carrying,
l strongly suggest y'all step off

37:23.460 --> 37:25.499
before the Man gets here,
you know what l'm saying?

37:25.670 --> 37:27.211
Oh, you're larger than life now, huh?

37:27.380 --> 37:30.997
Siren don't mean nothing
to you, huh? Move!

37:33.468 --> 37:34.878
lf you're looking to score,

37:35.053 --> 37:38.717
l strongly suggest you go back
to your side of the hill.

37:38.932 --> 37:40.307
You hear me?

37:48.273 --> 37:51.439
Hey, l'm not a doper, man.
l'm a friend of Charise's.

37:52.277 --> 37:54.483
More like a neighbour.

37:55.321 --> 37:57.990
You're Devo, right? Devo Damars?

37:58.616 --> 38:00.822
- Who wants to know?
- l'm Brandon Walsh.

38:00.993 --> 38:03.662
l'm a reporter for my school newspaper
at West Beverly High.

38:03.829 --> 38:06.153
l live down the block from Charise.

38:06.331 --> 38:08.868
l know what went down last night.
l want an interview with you.

38:09.083 --> 38:10.991
With all due respect,
you don't have a damn idea

38:11.168 --> 38:14.085
about what went down
here last night, you got that?

38:14.254 --> 38:16.246
- They did that to you, didn't they?
- What, this?

38:16.423 --> 38:19.625
No, you know, my moms accidentally
rolled over me with her Rolls-Royce.

38:19.843 --> 38:23.626
Seriously, man. Did security patrol
jack you up, or was it the city cops?

38:23.805 --> 38:24.836
Did you say ''jack you up''?

38:26.390 --> 38:28.678
You've been reading
your Spike Lee handbook, haven't--?

38:28.892 --> 38:31.726
You think you can drop the attitude
long enough to say what happened?

38:31.895 --> 38:33.223
- Why?
- lt's an important story.

38:33.438 --> 38:34.813
What is, man? You tell me.

38:34.981 --> 38:36.937
Being in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

38:37.108 --> 38:40.476
or being in the wrong place at
the wrong time with the wrong colour?

38:41.111 --> 38:43.981
You think for a minute it would've been
any different for you out there

38:44.156 --> 38:45.982
if l hadn't chased these guys off?

38:46.158 --> 38:48.114
- lt's not the same thing.
- Yes, it is, man!

38:48.285 --> 38:49.909
Wake up, all right?

38:50.078 --> 38:52.747
They don't roll out welcome mats
for my kind in Beverly Hills,

38:52.914 --> 38:55.784
and you should not feel free
to roam around these alleyways either.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.873
Yeah, but that doesn't
make it right, does it?

38:58.043 --> 38:59.786
Of course
it doesn't make it right, man.

38:59.961 --> 39:03.294
lt makes it the kind of world
that we live in today.

39:03.965 --> 39:05.791
l came down
and heard this guy on the radio,

39:05.967 --> 39:07.793
talking about that
Rodney King incident.

39:07.969 --> 39:09.546
The guy that got beat up
by the L.A.P.D.

39:09.762 --> 39:10.793
Yeah, l know who he is.

39:10.971 --> 39:13.129
Well, the amazing thing
wasn't what happened, blondie.

39:13.307 --> 39:15.595
Because see, that happens
every day down here.

39:15.767 --> 39:17.842
The amazing thing was
the whole thing

39:18.019 --> 39:21.304
got peeped out by somebody's
home-video camera.

39:22.815 --> 39:24.522
Excuse me.

39:31.239 --> 39:34.192
What are you saying, Devo?
We should let bygones be bygones?

39:34.367 --> 39:37.201
Well, hey, l mean,
it's a kinder, gentler nation, right?

39:37.370 --> 39:40.323
Give me a break, man.
You're so full of it, you stink.

39:40.497 --> 39:42.904
You look me in the eye,
tell me this doesn't make you angry.

39:43.083 --> 39:45.490
Look, man,
it makes me angry, all right?

39:45.669 --> 39:48.622
More important, it makes me sad.

39:50.089 --> 39:54.300
You want a story, blondie?
l got a story for you, all right?

39:55.302 --> 39:57.175
My mother,
who means the world to me,

39:57.346 --> 40:00.132
had to go out and beg for money, man,
in the middle of the night,

40:00.306 --> 40:02.512
to pay for a taxi to bring her
into Beverly Hills, man.

40:05.686 --> 40:09.268
l will never, ever forget
the expression on her face

40:09.440 --> 40:12.191
when she rolled
in that emergency room.

40:12.359 --> 40:14.150
My mom has four boys, four.

40:14.361 --> 40:15.689
Two of them are in prison,

40:15.862 --> 40:18.613
the other one's on the pipe,
and then there's me, man.

40:18.781 --> 40:21.271
l'm the one
she never had to worry about.

40:21.575 --> 40:24.824
All l do is try to please her, man,
and make her proud.

40:24.995 --> 40:27.117
l try to do what's right.

40:32.543 --> 40:33.622
Brandon.

40:41.843 --> 40:44.084
Brenda, what are you doing here?

40:45.096 --> 40:49.140
Well, after you left,
Robbie just happened to be walking by.

40:49.308 --> 40:53.969
So here we are. Kind of beat, huh?

40:54.980 --> 40:57.517
No, it's kind of nice.

41:05.447 --> 41:08.483
- You all right?
- This?

41:09.159 --> 41:10.736
Don't even worry about it, baby.

41:10.911 --> 41:13.947
Mama says
l'll always be handsome now.

41:14.330 --> 41:16.737
lt's just a minor setback.

41:18.334 --> 41:21.702
- We gotta talk, Devo.
- l know.

41:22.254 --> 41:24.293
Look, you want a tamale?

41:24.631 --> 41:26.919
- Right.
- Well, you liked them before.

41:27.759 --> 41:32.219
Well, l guess this means you're going
through with your big expose, huh?

41:33.556 --> 41:35.382
You know, l don't know anymore.

41:37.225 --> 41:39.133
Well, l think you should
put it out there.

41:39.311 --> 41:41.884
And if you do, there's some pictures

41:42.063 --> 41:45.146
that your trusty staff photographer's
been taking that you ought to look at.

41:50.154 --> 41:51.897
l'd like that.

41:53.615 --> 41:56.022
You know what l'd like, guys?

42:02.706 --> 42:04.781
You guys have got to try
the extra crispy.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.450
No, the Cajun spicy is the best,
and no calories.

42:16.218 --> 42:17.249
You're hysterical.

42:17.469 --> 42:19.757
You know what l wanna taste?
Popcorn in yogurt sauce.

42:20.931 --> 42:24.762
Oh, yeah. Well, you be sure
to tell papa about that recipe.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.256
Well, l hate to tell you this,

42:26.436 --> 42:28.926
but he's got that recipe already.
lt'll be out by Christmas.

42:29.146 --> 42:31.932
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah! Psyche!

42:32.608 --> 42:35.181
Do you know how good
your paper looks this week?

42:35.360 --> 42:37.731
Yeah, we know,
but you can tell us again.

42:37.946 --> 42:40.615
- The article is really great, Brandon.
- Thanks, Bren.

42:40.823 --> 42:42.779
Hey, wait, especially the pictures.

42:42.992 --> 42:44.783
Oh, especially the pictures.

42:44.952 --> 42:47.158
l like this part right here.

42:47.704 --> 42:51.202
''lt's when we stop looking
at the human race as individuals,

42:51.416 --> 42:54.202
we, as a generation, are in trouble.''

42:54.752 --> 42:58.001
- Eloquently put.
- l'm glad you liked it.

43:00.382 --> 43:02.006
Cindy, l got your note,

43:02.176 --> 43:04.797
and needless to say,
l am very disappointed.

43:05.011 --> 43:06.919
Look, Mrs. Cooper, l'm really sorry.

43:07.097 --> 43:08.923
But l can't talk right now.
We've got company.

43:09.098 --> 43:13.011
To impulsively just cancel
your contract with our security patrol

43:13.185 --> 43:14.928
because of one
questionable incident--

43:15.104 --> 43:17.677
Look, Mrs. Cooper,
l don't mean to be rude,

43:17.856 --> 43:22.481
but what this family does and why
we do it is really no concern of yours.

43:23.194 --> 43:26.360
And, you know, l met Mr. Caplan,
and l like his dogs.

43:27.406 --> 43:28.864
Goodbye.

43:29.908 --> 43:33.987
First professional game
l went to, 1 965 World Series.

43:34.454 --> 43:36.861
- Koufax versus the Twins, right?
- Yeah.

43:37.040 --> 43:39.115
Yeah, right,
l'll bet you're a Twins fan, huh?

43:46.590 --> 43:49.294
- Charise, what's up?
- Same old, same old.

43:49.467 --> 43:51.625
- Where are you going?
- Tamale Heaven.

43:52.303 --> 43:55.089
- Thought that place was off-limits.
- Not anymore.

43:55.264 --> 43:56.841
Ever since you did
your article on Devo,

43:57.016 --> 43:58.842
my dad's
been rediscovering his roots.

43:59.059 --> 44:01.549
- Glad to help.
- Thanks.

44:01.728 --> 44:03.305
So, what'd you think of the article?

44:03.480 --> 44:06.599
l think my brother's
an excellent photographer.

44:06.899 --> 44:09.021
You are brutal.

44:09.819 --> 44:11.313
Drive safely, Brandon.

44:11.529 --> 44:13.568
Thought that was supposed to be
my line.
