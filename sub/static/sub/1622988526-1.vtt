00:23.364 --> 00:28.243
Let's turn in our
Bibles to Ephesians five, 22.

00:28.286 --> 00:32.623
Wives submit onto your own
husband as onto the Lord,

00:32.665 --> 00:35.460
for the husband is
the head of the wife,

00:35.501 --> 00:38.421
even as Christ is the
head of the church.

00:38.462 --> 00:40.756
And he is the
savior of the body.

00:55.897 --> 00:57.732
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

00:58.650 --> 00:59.943
Reach the phone.

01:07.575 --> 01:08.534
Pick up, Pick up.

01:09.619 --> 01:12.330
If you would like
to leave a message, press one.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.331
Now listen to this.

01:13.372 --> 01:15.916
Therefore, as the church
is subject unto Christ,

01:15.959 --> 01:20.546
so let the wives be to their
own husbands in everything.

01:22.423 --> 01:27.428
Dad, I'm leaving
the church right now

01:28.637 --> 01:33.642
and something,
something happened

01:34.852 --> 01:37.437
and I need you to do
something for me dad.

01:37.480 --> 01:42.485
I, I think I may have done.

01:45.780 --> 01:47.656
Now as we head out today

01:47.699 --> 01:50.117
and we go to Take our
next meal with our family,

01:50.158 --> 01:52.035
let's just remember this.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.000
Husbands, well, our obligation

01:57.040 --> 01:59.626
is to keep the
household in order.

02:00.795 --> 02:04.799
And wive, well, keep it clean.

02:05.757 --> 02:10.012
Okay.

02:21.481 --> 02:22.983
Hello, gorgeous.

02:23.025 --> 02:26.653
- Hello.
- Hey.

02:26.695 --> 02:30.574
Do you think your husband
would mind if I kissed you?

02:32.701 --> 02:33.702
He may.

02:34.828 --> 02:36.164
But I say go for it anyway.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.042
Get a room.

02:46.298 --> 02:47.175
Ladies.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.262

smile on my face.

02:58.185 --> 03:01.189
Well no one's perfect Elaine.

03:01.231 --> 03:03.983
We all have our issues.

03:04.024 --> 03:05.150
It seems like you may have

03:05.193 --> 03:07.195
found that one
needle in a haystack.

03:09.112 --> 03:10.822
Hey girl, you are fine.

03:10.864 --> 03:11.824
What's that?

03:13.034 --> 03:14.035
Boys.

03:14.076 --> 03:15.744
Oh, now calm down Elizabeth.

03:20.082 --> 03:21.208
What?

03:21.250 --> 03:23.168
Hey, it's okay to
acknowledge her beauty.

03:23.211 --> 03:24.587
It's biblical.

03:26.838 --> 03:28.715
Hey at least the
boy aint gay, right?

03:33.262 --> 03:35.849
Hey, you don't worry
about your mom,

03:35.890 --> 03:37.183
all right, she's just jealous.

03:37.225 --> 03:39.018
Cause she knows that she
would embarrass us all

03:39.059 --> 03:41.604
If she tried to squeeze
into a dress like that.

03:45.357 --> 03:49.069
Good grief, hey Liz, Liz
stop for a second okay?

03:49.112 --> 03:51.364
Come here, it was just a joke.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.866
It wasn't funny.

03:52.906 --> 03:53.825
Okay.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.327
Well how about I take you out

03:56.368 --> 03:58.872
to a nice fancy restaurant
for lunch this week

03:58.912 --> 04:02.791
and you can wear the smallest
dress that you can fit into.

How was your workout?

06:26.018 --> 06:28.228
It was good, worked
up an appetite.

Patience grasshopper.

This is for dinner.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.201
I have some lunch for
you in the fridge.

06:43.619 --> 06:45.204
Hey baby, go grab that red bowl

06:45.246 --> 06:46.539
from the refrigerator for me.

So what do we have going
on for the rest of the day?

06:52.170 --> 06:53.713
I am meeting Grace.

06:53.754 --> 06:56.298
I haven't seen my
sister in over a year

06:56.340 --> 06:59.052
and she only lives
45 minutes from me.

06:59.093 --> 07:03.473
That's because we decided
that she wasn't in a good place

07:03.514 --> 07:07.476
and that we didn't want her
dragging you down with her.

07:07.518 --> 07:10.396
No, you decided that
she wasn't in a good place

07:10.437 --> 07:12.147
because she's single.

07:13.148 --> 07:15.442
I think it would be really nice
to catch up with my sister.

07:15.485 --> 07:18.153
I'll only be an hour
and a half or so.

07:18.196 --> 07:20.532
I think she can help me
get my book off the ground.

07:22.617 --> 07:24.285
You said that you
supported that.

07:27.162 --> 07:29.122
You know I support
everything you do.

07:30.290 --> 07:31.166
It's fine.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.044
Go.

07:34.127 --> 07:37.714
Maybe we can go to a
movie when mama gets back.

07:37.756 --> 07:39.466
Mommy's too busy for us today.

07:41.386 --> 07:44.304
Faith, baby, a
movie is a great idea.

07:44.347 --> 07:46.099
We'll all go when I get back.

07:51.812 --> 07:54.356
Is this going to
be a problem later?

07:55.316 --> 07:56.109
Not for me.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.236
You know what?
I'll just cancel.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.487
I can meet up with
her some other time.

07:59.528 --> 08:01.905
Whatever you decide.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.449
You're hanging out
all times of day,

08:03.490 --> 08:04.741
and I'm working my butt.

08:04.783 --> 08:06.368
How am I hanging out?

08:06.410 --> 08:09.622
I'm at home every
single day, all day.

08:09.663 --> 08:10.789
I am done with
this conversation.

08:13.876 --> 08:15.295
I'm done.

08:15.336 --> 08:16.504
Don't you
walk away from me.

08:16.545 --> 08:18.380

hands off of me.

08:18.422 --> 08:19.590

08:29.434 --> 08:34.439

08:44.741 --> 08:47.327

was a good day.

08:47.367 --> 08:48.453
And why is that?

08:48.493 --> 08:50.997
Let me show you how to
properly greet your husband.

08:52.497 --> 08:53.665
I know how to
greet you Michael,

08:53.708 --> 08:55.709
I'm just trying to
get your ironing done

08:55.751 --> 08:57.420
so I can have your
dinner ready by seven.

08:57.462 --> 09:01.466
First you smile
when he walks in.

09:01.506 --> 09:03.800
Then you kiss him,
like you haven't

09:03.843 --> 09:06.762
seen him for days, embrace him.

09:06.804 --> 09:07.639
Embrace me.

09:19.567 --> 09:20.610
That's all I get?

09:21.652 --> 09:22.945
Tell me about your day.

09:24.112 --> 09:26.491
We've got the yes we've been
waiting on for the permit.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.491
Oh, that's fantastic.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.744
I guess I finally won
him over with my charm.

09:29.785 --> 09:30.994
Well I'm proud of you.

09:32.579 --> 09:35.624
I ran into a church
member this morning.

09:37.709 --> 09:41.672
I'm concerned, her face
was bruised pretty badly.

09:41.713 --> 09:43.465
Did she tell
you what happened?

09:44.675 --> 09:46.051
Yeah, it's her husband.

09:47.136 --> 09:48.512
I don't know much about him,

09:48.554 --> 09:49.763
I've only seen him at
church a few times.

09:49.805 --> 09:51.391
Is she a good wife to him?

09:53.601 --> 09:57.564
I don't know, but he
shouldn't be beating on her.

09:57.604 --> 09:59.690
Okay, that's not what I meant.

09:59.732 --> 10:03.819
But usually men
lash out like that

10:03.862 --> 10:05.737
because their wives
are pushing them.

10:07.656 --> 10:08.699
Explain.

10:08.741 --> 10:11.619
The more respect
you show a man,

10:11.660 --> 10:13.704
the more love he
will give in return.

10:17.165 --> 10:19.501
Can't believe this is
coming out of your mouth.

10:19.544 --> 10:21.670
Well, it's not, it's biblical.

10:23.046 --> 10:25.632
The Bible literally
commands wives to respect

10:25.675 --> 10:28.678
their husbands,
to submit to them.

10:28.719 --> 10:31.598
It's going to be in their
best interest for both of them

10:31.639 --> 10:33.725
if she's as obedient to him

10:33.766 --> 10:36.644
as possible while he's
going through this phase.

10:36.685 --> 10:37.561
Phase?

10:37.603 --> 10:38.729
Clearly it's not who he is

10:38.771 --> 10:40.647
or she wouldn't
have married him.

10:40.689 --> 10:42.441
Now if his, if
his heart changes,

10:42.482 --> 10:46.069
well, then that's a win for
her and for the kingdom.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.487
Yeah, praise God.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.700
So I should do nothing?

10:54.078 --> 10:56.079
Offer to counsel
them together.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.122
Maybe that'll help.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.628
Anyway, I'll be back down
at seven for my dinner.

11:11.721 --> 11:14.224
How about I look
into getting you

11:14.265 --> 11:16.266
a little radio for
when you're home?

11:17.602 --> 11:19.728
That way you can
sing with the music.

11:19.771 --> 11:20.729
Come on, don't look
at me like that.

11:20.771 --> 11:22.689
You're singing's not that bad.

11:22.732 --> 11:24.025
Oh baby, come here, come here.

11:27.779 --> 11:29.197
I wouldn't worry about it okay?

11:30.906 --> 11:32.908
You're talented at
so many other things.

11:41.793 --> 11:43.126
Girl, he had to go.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.545
He was so fine though.

11:44.587 --> 11:46.798
Grace, and he had an accent?

11:46.838 --> 11:48.215
Coy, you are married.

11:48.257 --> 11:50.759
Married, not
blinds and not dead.

11:50.801 --> 11:52.052
Maybe I should find a cop.

11:52.094 --> 11:53.762
I mean, both of y'all
dipped into that pool,

11:53.804 --> 11:55.765
so how's the water?

11:55.806 --> 11:56.682
Derek is fine.

11:56.723 --> 11:59.017
Yes he is, mine's
getting a little pudgy

11:59.059 --> 12:01.353
in the midsection,
and his feet stink.

12:01.396 --> 12:02.896
But he keep you
looking, right?

12:02.939 --> 12:05.107
It's so stressful being
married to a police office,

12:05.149 --> 12:07.944
and he brings all his
stress home, all the time.

12:07.986 --> 12:09.821
He does like, what does he do?

12:09.862 --> 12:11.280
He's just moody.

12:11.322 --> 12:15.910
Sometimes he yells, he'll
slam doors, he'll throw stuff.

12:15.952 --> 12:16.910
It's whatever though.

12:18.954 --> 12:20.122
Has he ever hit you?

12:20.164 --> 12:21.833
Oh honey, my whole
family is crazy.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.251
He knows it.

12:23.293 --> 12:25.003
He's a jerk, but he makes
up for it on payday.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.420
The gifts make
up for everything?

12:26.462 --> 12:27.922
The yelling, the moods?

12:27.963 --> 12:29.924
What's the alternative,
dating again?

12:29.966 --> 12:32.760
I'm not going back to kissing
frogs and hoping for a Prince.

12:32.801 --> 12:35.345
I just stick it out with
the moody toad I do have.

12:35.387 --> 12:36.973
Well get it how you live,

12:37.015 --> 12:40.018
but next time, can
you get a group gift?

12:40.059 --> 12:40.894
Just saying.

12:50.402 --> 12:54.364
I needed that, I haven't
been out in forever.

12:55.532 --> 12:57.910
So are we going
to talk about it?

12:57.952 --> 12:59.037
About what?

13:06.001 --> 13:07.045
I don't know, Grace.

13:08.963 --> 13:11.381
It seems like everything
is just falling apart.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.425
When did this start?

13:13.468 --> 13:14.511
A few months ago.

13:16.304 --> 13:18.932
We took a trip to a
little bed and breakfast.

13:18.973 --> 13:21.976
The news popped up about
a cop shooting another kid

13:23.019 --> 13:27.065
and we were on our way out
the door and he lost it.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.525
Okay?

13:28.565 --> 13:31.777
It was the first time he
ever lost it on me like that.

13:32.529 --> 13:35.949
He hit me so hard.

13:35.990 --> 13:40.411
My husband hit me like I
was some man off the street.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.413
I'm so sorry.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.092
Those same hands
taught me how to play

13:54.132 --> 13:55.926
this piano when we got married.

13:58.512 --> 14:01.139
Patient, gentle.

14:02.599 --> 14:04.059
Those same hands.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.064
I just can't figure out what
I did to change him so much.

14:09.107 --> 14:11.192
You can't think
this is your fault?

14:11.233 --> 14:12.192
Who's is it?

14:12.234 --> 14:14.528
His, all his.

14:14.570 --> 14:17.030
How often is he doing this?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.534
Usually after he's
had a few beers.

14:20.410 --> 14:22.078
It started out once a month,

14:22.120 --> 14:24.122
but now he's drinking more.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.331
Faith?

14:25.372 --> 14:27.249
Oh no, he has never
laid a hand on her.

14:27.291 --> 14:29.126
It's not okay for
him to hit you either.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.129
He's not a monster, Grace.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.171
This isn't him.

14:33.213 --> 14:35.007
He is truly sorry
for the last time,

14:35.049 --> 14:36.634
he promised he would
never do it again.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.552
Promises don't mean squat.

14:38.594 --> 14:41.598
And sorry isn't worth the
oxygen it takes to say it.

14:41.639 --> 14:45.351
You know, this was supposed
to be girls' night in.

14:45.392 --> 14:47.519
I turned it into a pity party.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.650
It's okay for you to
talk to me about this.

14:56.195 --> 14:57.029
I know.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.409
I just don't want
to, not tonight.

15:01.450 --> 15:03.535
But we will talk more.

15:03.578 --> 15:05.163
I'm here for you
whenever you need me

15:05.204 --> 15:07.706
and you and Faith always
have a place with me.

15:07.748 --> 15:08.665
Thanks, sis.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.043
I may take you up on that.

15:14.631 --> 15:16.049
Please don't tell dad.

15:16.757 --> 15:18.216
No, but I sure wouldn't mind

15:18.218 --> 15:19.551
throwing something at his ass.

15:24.681 --> 15:25.766
I couldn't believe it.

15:25.808 --> 15:27.352
Right?

15:27.392 --> 15:30.354
Hey, go
get in there, go.

15:31.314 --> 15:32.482
Aunty, Grace!

15:32.524 --> 15:33.357
Hey.

15:36.276 --> 15:39.071
Look what daddy bought me?

15:39.112 --> 15:43.242
Let me see, whoa, that's
really nice sweet pea.

15:43.284 --> 15:44.785
How about you go upstairs,

15:44.827 --> 15:47.455
put it in your jewelry
box, and hop in the tub?

15:47.497 --> 15:48.289
Okay.

15:48.330 --> 15:49.331
Okay, all right.

15:52.544 --> 15:55.213
Grace, haven't
seen you in a while.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.381
Way too long,

15:57.423 --> 16:00.093
but you'll be seeing a
lot more of me now though.

16:02.303 --> 16:04.304
Grace, could you
please give us a second?

16:07.433 --> 16:09.184
Sure.

16:09.227 --> 16:10.602
I'll go hang out with my niece.

16:21.698 --> 16:24.284
Look, I know that this gift

16:27.328 --> 16:28.538
won't make up for what I did.

16:28.579 --> 16:30.290
But you have to know
that I love you.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.540
How would I know that Derek?

16:31.583 --> 16:33.251
Because it's me.

16:33.293 --> 16:36.379
It's us, always been us.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.506
Look in my eyes.

16:39.882 --> 16:41.593
I'm going to make
you proud again.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.597
It'll be just like it
used to be, promise.

16:48.391 --> 16:52.187
No more hitting, I mean it.

16:52.227 --> 16:53.438
Cross my heart.

16:53.478 --> 16:58.233
No face this beautiful,
should be hit, ever.

17:06.783 --> 17:09.244
It will never happen again.

17:15.918 --> 17:17.377
Do you forgive me?

17:20.464 --> 17:22.300
Now give me my gift.

18:06.594 --> 18:07.636
I love it babe.

18:09.973 --> 18:11.014
Never again, okay?

18:12.349 --> 18:16.603
All that other stuff,
it's behind us.

18:16.646 --> 18:18.481
Let me take you out.

18:18.522 --> 18:19.314
Tonight?

18:19.357 --> 18:20.316
No, I can't.

18:20.357 --> 18:21.943
Yes, baby, let
me take you out.

18:21.984 --> 18:23.569
Grace can stay here with Faith.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.867
Yeah?

18:29.908 --> 18:30.784

Running a little
late on dinner, aren't you?

20:31.239 --> 20:32.740
I had a session that ran over

20:32.781 --> 20:35.326
and then mom called and
talked for over an hour.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.785
And you wanted steak instead

20:36.828 --> 20:38.328
of the chicken I'd
already prepared.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.873
Dinner should be on
the table at seven.

20:40.915 --> 20:44.210
I don't expect your mother
to care about such things

20:44.251 --> 20:46.838
since her idea of dinner
was a bucket of chicken

20:46.879 --> 20:48.714
on the table and
nine every night.

20:49.883 --> 20:52.218
But you know how our
household is run.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.677
It'll be ready shortly.

20:54.887 --> 20:58.640
A wife's priority
after God is her husband

20:58.683 --> 21:01.853
and then comes work,
and friends, and family

21:01.895 --> 21:03.312
and that includes your mother

21:04.938 --> 21:06.398
I said, it'll
be ready shortly.

21:06.441 --> 21:08.735
Don't rush past the seasoning.

21:26.168 --> 21:27.377
Yes?

21:27.419 --> 21:30.297
Any other man
would feel unloved

21:30.339 --> 21:33.760
by his wife who was coming
home and not acknowledging him.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.386
I'm just trying to get
your dinner on the table.

21:35.427 --> 21:38.723
Maybe if you cut the
cackle session short

21:38.764 --> 21:39.932
with your mother then

21:39.973 --> 21:41.934
I wouldn't have to
forfeit my greeting.

21:42.894 --> 21:43.895
Good evening Michael.

21:49.983 --> 21:51.026
Wow.

21:52.153 --> 21:53.238
Just like old friends.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.833
Why do you keep testing me?

22:06.876 --> 22:07.751
Testing you?

22:08.919 --> 22:09.753
Nevermind.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.465
No, no, no, no,
explain what you mean.

22:12.507 --> 22:13.341
Nevermind.

22:13.383 --> 22:14.342
I don't want to argue.

22:14.384 --> 22:15.385
So you're okay?

22:15.425 --> 22:16.552
Great.

22:18.972 --> 22:20.223
May I get back to your steak?

22:20.264 --> 22:22.057
I'll be in the dining room.

22:22.099 --> 22:24.101
Oh, and it's almost seven.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.355
You look so much
younger when you smile.

22:28.188 --> 22:29.147
It's nice.

22:35.530 --> 22:37.197
Your mother is
a terrible person.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.325
You only had chicken at nine,

22:39.367 --> 22:41.578
well what's wrong
with freaking chicken?

22:41.618 --> 22:42.453
God.

22:49.251 --> 22:50.211
It's okay.

22:57.676 --> 22:58.511
7:04.

23:42.055 --> 23:43.681
Let's bless this meal no matter

23:43.723 --> 23:45.474
how late it was
put on the table.

23:48.353 --> 23:49.145
Dear Lord.

23:49.186 --> 23:50.396
Thank you for this day

23:50.437 --> 23:52.439
and for this food
that was prepared

23:52.482 --> 23:54.483
for the nourishment
of our bodies

23:54.526 --> 23:58.196
and thank you for the beautiful
hands that prepared it.

24:07.371 --> 24:08.664
I know
it's a little over done.

24:08.705 --> 24:10.290
Nope, come here honey.

24:11.251 --> 24:12.417
Come here.

24:22.177 --> 24:23.470
Look at this here.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.393
How do I like my steak prepared?

24:30.854 --> 24:31.980
I was trying.

24:32.021 --> 24:36.358
Instead of cutting short
the enthralling conversation

24:36.401 --> 24:37.735
you were having
with your mother,

24:37.777 --> 24:42.407
this less than mediocre
meal is my fault?

24:43.491 --> 24:45.285
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

24:49.246 --> 24:50.080
Clean it up.

24:58.505 --> 24:59.381
I'm going out.

25:19.402 --> 25:20.528
Hey babe.

25:20.569 --> 25:23.489
Must be nice to just sit
around all day, watching TV.

25:24.490 --> 25:25.366
Huh?

25:25.407 --> 25:26.783
I've been working all day.

25:30.245 --> 25:31.455
You call what you do work?

25:37.419 --> 25:38.712
You're drinking.

25:41.590 --> 25:42.425
So.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.970
Come sit down, tell
me what's going on.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.388
You fix dinner?

25:48.431 --> 25:50.850
Yes, come sit down.

25:50.892 --> 25:52.352
It's should still be warm.

25:55.896 --> 25:58.691
So what's going on?

26:01.027 --> 26:01.861
Rough night out?

26:08.826 --> 26:11.621
Babe, can you not hear me?

26:11.663 --> 26:13.373
Yeah I hear you.

26:16.542 --> 26:17.918
Dinner is served.

26:21.505 --> 26:22.506
Okay.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.984
So all this shit is funny
right now to you, huh?

26:42.026 --> 26:42.986
What?

26:45.029 --> 26:47.949
I just came home from a
terrible ass day at work,

26:47.991 --> 26:50.033
and you sitting up in
here laughing in my face.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.828
I tried talking to you,
but you didn't respond.

26:53.996 --> 26:55.038
I thought I would
be a bigger help

26:55.080 --> 26:56.582
by just leaving you alone.

26:57.666 --> 27:01.838
Eating popcorn and laughing
in my damn face is helping me?

27:01.879 --> 27:03.130
Am I entertaining you?

27:03.172 --> 27:05.133
I was laughing at
the movie, not you.

27:05.175 --> 27:06.759
You know I wouldn't do that.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.011
What is wrong with you?

27:08.051 --> 27:10.597
Oh, so now I'm the
problem here too?

27:15.184 --> 27:18.396
I don't know what
happened at work,

27:19.771 --> 27:23.400
but we said that we would
stay calm and talk it out.

27:24.610 --> 27:25.819
And are you a
fucking councilor?

27:33.994 --> 27:35.162
Derek.

27:38.165 --> 27:40.835
Derek, calm down.

27:40.876 --> 27:42.837
Don't tell me to calm down.

27:42.878 --> 27:45.005
Derek, Derek.

27:46.257 --> 27:47.759
Get me another beer.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.617
I said, get me another beer.

28:15.869 --> 28:16.870
This one's empty.

28:19.081 --> 28:19.998
Get up.

28:20.040 --> 28:20.958
No, no!

28:21.000 --> 28:22.626
Get up.

28:23.794 --> 28:25.879
No, Derek, please!

28:33.262 --> 28:35.682
And so at this time,

28:35.723 --> 28:38.059
those of you who are
in need of prayer.

28:39.601 --> 28:41.271
Or if you have family

28:41.311 --> 28:45.732

prayer, meet me at the altar.

I haven't seen you in awhile.

30:00.390 --> 30:02.309
He's not going to change.

30:03.310 --> 30:04.145
You have to.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.981
I have to change?

30:07.022 --> 30:07.982
What?

30:08.023 --> 30:10.025
Be a better wife?

30:10.068 --> 30:11.360

30:11.402 --> 30:13.029
Tell me, what do

30:13.070 --> 30:16.741
You have to get out of
there before he kills you.

30:16.782 --> 30:19.202
Like I told you before,
I'm not leaving him.

30:19.243 --> 30:21.328
Derek is a good man deep down.

30:21.370 --> 30:23.665
He pays all the bills, and
he keeps food on the table.

30:23.705 --> 30:24.873
And I'm sure he makes you feel

30:24.915 --> 30:28.086
like the most special
person in the world.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.462
Most of the time.

30:29.503 --> 30:32.965
He needs me, and
Faith and I need him.

30:33.007 --> 30:35.093
He won't stop.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.095
Do you have any idea how hard

30:37.136 --> 30:39.806
it is right now to
be a police officer?

30:39.848 --> 30:43.059
Half of the world hates you
because of the corrupt ones.

30:43.100 --> 30:45.270
Ad being black and
people hate you

30:45.310 --> 30:46.436
because you're a sellout.

30:46.479 --> 30:47.981
Every day he goes out there

30:48.021 --> 30:49.439
and put his life on the line.

30:49.482 --> 30:51.984
And then he comes home
and does this to you.

30:53.569 --> 30:55.405
It isn't okay.

30:55.445 --> 31:00.409
No matter how many lives
he saves, this is not okay.

31:04.998 --> 31:08.501
Is your marriage so perfect
that you can't understand

31:08.542 --> 31:11.044
that couples go through
a few rough patches?

31:11.087 --> 31:13.047
I see how pastor
Jeffrey treats you

31:13.088 --> 31:16.091
but would you leave him if
he was abusive a few times?

31:19.345 --> 31:20.180
Yes.

31:21.973 --> 31:23.015
I would.

31:23.057 --> 31:25.434
Than you're lying to yourself.

31:25.475 --> 31:27.270
It's easy when it's
not your reality

31:29.021 --> 31:31.148
You know they granted
my permit right?

31:31.191 --> 31:34.152
At first we get the program,
then we get the school.

31:34.194 --> 31:36.361
I heard, you know
your little brother,

31:36.404 --> 31:38.198
he already has his own Academy

31:38.239 --> 31:40.575
and a yearly mission
out of his church.

31:44.244 --> 31:45.579
He'll get there.

31:45.621 --> 31:47.581
Oh, that's so nice.

31:48.499 --> 31:51.085
Having your little lady
speak on your behalf.

31:51.126 --> 31:55.964
Be careful, some might consider
that a sign of weakness.

31:56.007 --> 31:57.342
She doesn't speak for me.

31:59.260 --> 32:00.677
And I'll have that
school within a year.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.972
I got the permit, I
will get that school.

32:05.224 --> 32:09.061
Son, you think you got that
permit on your own don't you?

32:12.272 --> 32:13.440
It was you?

32:13.482 --> 32:14.442
I don't mind
throwing my weight

32:14.483 --> 32:16.026
around a little bit for my boy.

32:20.322 --> 32:22.658
Matthew, why don't you go
ahead and get these dishes?

32:22.700 --> 32:24.369
Oh wait, wait a second.

32:24.409 --> 32:26.537
You're having your
boy do dishes?

32:26.578 --> 32:27.496
What are you trying to do,

32:27.539 --> 32:29.249
turn him into a housewife?

32:29.290 --> 32:31.751
Everyone does their part
around here. Mr. Jeffries.

32:31.792 --> 32:32.876
Why don't you come
with your granddad

32:32.918 --> 32:35.713
and we're going to go watch
a game in the living room.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.215
We'll let your mother
and your grandmother,

32:38.258 --> 32:39.759
they'll take care of the dishes.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.593
And I am going to teach you all

32:41.636 --> 32:46.182
about the roles that God
created for man and woman.

32:47.308 --> 32:49.394
I had such high hopes
for this one here.

32:51.479 --> 32:54.274
So Mikey, you want to stay

32:54.315 --> 32:56.442
and help the women
with the dishes?

33:00.738 --> 33:02.365
Michael.

33:02.406 --> 33:04.324
Oh, doing the dishes
won't kill you, Liz.

33:04.367 --> 33:05.742
You do them most
of the time anyway.

33:05.784 --> 33:06.743
You're letting
him come in here

33:06.786 --> 33:08.872
and tell your wife what to do?

33:08.913 --> 33:10.415
A husband should be able to do

33:10.455 --> 33:12.416
whatever he chooses in his home.

33:13.334 --> 33:15.128
His castle.

33:15.168 --> 33:16.588
Is that so?

33:16.628 --> 33:17.838
Well in this house...

33:17.880 --> 33:20.340
You will not cause
a scene in my home.

33:20.383 --> 33:23.595
You see how my mom just got up
without a word of complaint?

33:23.636 --> 33:25.512
You can learn a thing
or two from her.

33:37.858 --> 33:40.360
It's no reason to
be so upset dear.

33:40.403 --> 33:41.404
Bernie's, right.

33:42.530 --> 33:44.907
Washing dishes is not
a chore for a boy.

33:44.948 --> 33:46.533
So you're okay with
all this role stuff?

33:46.576 --> 33:49.495
There've always been
roles for men and women

33:49.537 --> 33:54.542
and if we are to be good wives
as the good Lord instructs,

33:55.460 --> 33:56.627
we acknowledge those roles.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.213
So just submit, under
every circumstance.

34:00.714 --> 34:02.591
Under every circumstance.

34:02.634 --> 34:04.426
Michael's a great
man, Elizabeth,

34:04.469 --> 34:05.761
and you should be grateful that

34:05.802 --> 34:08.347
you have someone who
treats you so well.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.352
He is a great man.

34:13.602 --> 34:16.563
He's just not a great husband.

34:17.731 --> 34:19.900
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

34:19.943 --> 34:22.278
He treats you like a queen.

34:22.319 --> 34:24.530
Yes, sometimes.

34:24.571 --> 34:27.825
And then sometimes he's abusive.

34:30.620 --> 34:31.578
Is Michael hitting you?

34:31.620 --> 34:33.664
No, no, he's just...

34:33.705 --> 34:35.582
Well then how is it abuse?

34:35.624 --> 34:36.833
I don't know.

34:37.752 --> 34:40.004
I don't know if it's
abuse, I just, I feel...

34:40.046 --> 34:43.633
We are here to help our
husbands reach their greatness

34:44.551 --> 34:46.553
and that's not always easy.

34:47.636 --> 34:48.513
I'm just not happy.

34:51.432 --> 34:52.392
I don't know why.

34:52.432 --> 34:53.976
You'll figure it out
what's wrong with you.

34:55.937 --> 34:57.397
Wrong with me?

34:57.437 --> 34:59.606
Our husbands are
exceptional men.

34:59.649 --> 35:03.486
They don't curse, or hit us,
or step out with other women.

35:03.528 --> 35:06.321
Yeah.

35:06.363 --> 35:08.992
Can we keep this
conversation just between us?

35:10.118 --> 35:11.661
Like it never happened, dear.

35:12.787 --> 35:14.539
Please, will you
rinse these dishes?

35:14.580 --> 35:15.622
My knees need a break.

35:15.664 --> 35:16.999
Of course, I'm sorry.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.417
Please, rest.

35:20.544 --> 35:23.798
Michael's trying to fill
some pretty big shoes.

35:23.839 --> 35:25.758
Try and give him
a break, ya hear?

35:34.725 --> 35:37.729
♪ The angels for me ♪

35:39.022 --> 35:40.690
You don't have
to stop singing,

35:40.731 --> 35:41.648
Look what I found.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.485
Surprise, so you
don't have to feel

35:45.528 --> 35:47.696
so uncomfortable
about being so pitchy.

35:48.781 --> 35:51.618
I'm glad you and my mom got
to spend some time together.

35:51.658 --> 35:52.618
Mhm.

35:52.660 --> 35:53.536
That's all?

35:54.787 --> 35:56.414
Can we talk about this later?

35:56.455 --> 35:57.789
I have some things on my mind.

35:59.167 --> 36:01.794
Like what you were
talking to my mom about?

36:03.171 --> 36:04.714
Excuse me?

36:04.756 --> 36:05.798
Well, I saw you
talking quietly

36:05.839 --> 36:07.716
to her while she
was washing dishes.

36:07.758 --> 36:11.470
So what were you talking about?

36:13.180 --> 36:14.307
I asked you a question.

36:14.348 --> 36:16.684
That's really between your
mother and me and Michael.

36:18.852 --> 36:20.646
Your husband is
asking you a question.

36:20.687 --> 36:22.773
Can I just finish
these dishes?

36:22.814 --> 36:23.816
We can talk later.

36:25.609 --> 36:26.861
Your husband's
asking you a question,

36:26.903 --> 36:27.986
and that means we talk now.

36:28.028 --> 36:30.781
I asked, I'm asking for space.

36:33.075 --> 36:35.577
Wives submit to
your husbands as God.

36:35.620 --> 36:36.746
I know the scripture.

36:36.787 --> 36:38.872
What were you talking
to my mother about?

36:39.832 --> 36:42.502
You and me Michael, we
were talking about us.

36:44.754 --> 36:45.797
I already knew that.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.051
You don't think my mother

36:50.093 --> 36:52.678
would keep something like
that from me, do you?

36:52.720 --> 36:54.305
She couldn't wait
to run and tell you.

36:54.347 --> 36:55.765
This isn't about her,

36:55.807 --> 36:56.890
this is about you
and your defiance

36:56.932 --> 36:58.100
and you're going behind my back.

36:58.142 --> 36:58.935
Defiance?

36:58.977 --> 37:00.185
Yes.

37:00.227 --> 37:01.854
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

37:01.896 --> 37:03.939
Yeah, well you don't really
have that option, do you?

37:13.783 --> 37:15.285
Who else have you
been talking to?

37:16.160 --> 37:17.245
Your mother?

37:17.287 --> 37:19.205
Is this what we're doing now?

37:19.247 --> 37:21.249
Ignoring me when we're talking?

37:21.290 --> 37:22.709
You're talking Michael.

37:22.749 --> 37:23.626
I'm just here.

37:24.669 --> 37:26.838
You can follow me all over
the house if you want to

37:26.879 --> 37:28.923
but you can not force me
to have a conversation

37:28.964 --> 37:30.883
that I don't want to have.

37:30.925 --> 37:32.926
Son, when it comes time
for you to pick out a wife

37:32.968 --> 37:35.179
make sure you find one who
is respectful and obedient.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.847
How dare you
bring him into this?

37:36.890 --> 37:39.100
My responsibility as
a parent is to make sure

37:39.142 --> 37:41.810
that he is capable of making
the right decisions in life.

37:41.852 --> 37:42.896
That's right, son.

37:48.776 --> 37:50.904
Let's go to the store.

37:50.944 --> 37:51.863
Okay.

37:54.948 --> 37:57.242
And where do you
think you're going?

37:57.285 --> 37:59.328
Get back in the house.

37:59.370 --> 38:01.915
We just want to
go for ice cream.

38:01.955 --> 38:03.999
Yeah, so get out of our way.

38:04.042 --> 38:06.169
You're not going anywhere.

38:08.046 --> 38:08.963
You hear me?

38:09.004 --> 38:11.965
You're not going anywhere.

38:12.008 --> 38:14.468
Okay, I'm sorry, I'll stay.

38:14.510 --> 38:17.804
Faith, why does
your mom always

38:17.847 --> 38:20.390
wear sunglasses even inside?

38:22.185 --> 38:25.230
Her eyes are
sensitive to light.

38:25.271 --> 38:30.276
Oh, my mom told my dad that
she always has bruises too.

38:30.818 --> 38:33.278
She just falls a lot.

38:33.321 --> 38:36.281
She's really clumsy sometimes.

38:36.323 --> 38:37.492
Oh.

38:37.533 --> 38:40.827
Hey girls, do
y'all want a snack?

38:40.870 --> 38:42.038
Okay.

38:44.039 --> 38:45.999
You're the best mom ever.

38:50.088 --> 38:53.048
No, I'm not, but
I'm trying, baby.

38:57.386 --> 38:59.388
You don't have to do that.

38:59.430 --> 39:00.973
I'm coming to apologize.

39:01.015 --> 39:03.268
I never should've brought
Matthew into this.

39:06.144 --> 39:08.021
Is that all you're
apologizing for?

39:10.066 --> 39:11.401
What else is there?

39:16.113 --> 39:17.030
What are you doing?

39:18.867 --> 39:20.325
It's been four days Liz.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.162
And?

39:25.330 --> 39:28.334
And I'm struggling.

39:31.004 --> 39:35.175
This is why so many marriages
open up to temptation.

39:35.216 --> 39:38.219
There are certain things that
are expected of you as a wife.

39:41.263 --> 39:43.557
So I'm just
supposed to say yes

39:43.600 --> 39:45.393
every time you want to have sex,

39:45.435 --> 39:47.353
even if I don't want to,

39:47.394 --> 39:50.063
because that's my
duty as a wife?

39:50.106 --> 39:51.107
Yes.

39:52.107 --> 39:54.234
Just like how you expect
me to go out and make money

39:54.276 --> 39:56.612
because that's my
duty as a husband.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.535
I'm not having sex with
you tonight, Michael.

40:04.162 --> 40:07.247
So you can do, you can do
whatever you decide to do.

40:09.167 --> 40:09.959
Michael, let go of me.

40:10.001 --> 40:12.252
You are still my wife.

40:12.294 --> 40:14.379
We are of the same flesh Lizzy.

40:14.421 --> 40:15.464
Michael.

40:15.506 --> 40:17.966
Do not deny your husband.

40:18.008 --> 40:19.968
Michael, you're hurting me.

40:20.010 --> 40:21.011
Come, shh, shh, shh.

40:27.100 --> 40:29.604
Tell me you love me Lizzy.

40:29.646 --> 40:31.231
I love you so much.

40:33.316 --> 40:34.192
Tell me that.

40:36.568 --> 40:37.736
Michael.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.490
Lizzy, I love you so much.

It's no big deal.

The big deal is
we aren't arguing.

41:49.934 --> 41:52.604
I don't want her to
think that it's okay.

41:52.644 --> 41:53.812
All of that's in the past.

41:53.854 --> 41:55.856
And the past seems to
keep repeating itself.

41:55.899 --> 41:56.732
I gave you my word.

41:56.774 --> 41:57.609
Again.

42:01.571 --> 42:04.365
I bought you flowers,
you love flowers.

42:04.406 --> 42:05.825
You're not gonna
thank me for that?

42:05.867 --> 42:06.910
No.

42:06.950 --> 42:07.952
Take the flowers.

42:07.993 --> 42:09.287
And then what?

42:09.328 --> 42:10.955
We start all over tomorrow.

42:10.997 --> 42:12.457
I said that that
was in the past.

42:12.497 --> 42:13.624
Why are you trying
to start a fight?

42:13.665 --> 42:15.584
You can't buy my
forgiveness anymore.

42:16.919 --> 42:18.421
Meaning?

42:18.463 --> 42:19.839
What would you say to
your daughter if you knew

42:19.881 --> 42:21.925
some man was giving
her black eyes?

42:21.966 --> 42:23.426
What would you tell
her to do Derek?

42:23.468 --> 42:24.636
You thinking about leaving me?

42:24.676 --> 42:26.220
Would you try to stop me?

42:28.097 --> 42:29.265
If I had to.

42:31.559 --> 42:32.352
Look, look, look, look,

42:32.392 --> 42:34.269
okay, okay, okay,
listen, listen, look.

42:34.312 --> 42:39.317
I have these beautiful
flowers here, for you.

42:39.984 --> 42:40.944
I've apologized for all that

42:40.984 --> 42:42.819
other stuff that
happened before.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.488
So let the past
just be the past.

42:45.656 --> 42:50.370
Now, are you going to
take these flowers?

42:51.412 --> 42:53.455
Or am I going to have to
give them to somebody else?

42:53.497 --> 42:55.582
Don't nobody want your
ugly ass sunflowers.

43:21.109 --> 43:21.943
Damn!

43:24.696 --> 43:25.613
You see?

43:25.655 --> 43:26.823
I try to do something nice for

43:26.865 --> 43:28.867
your ungrateful ass,
but you want to fight.

43:28.908 --> 43:31.743
Don't come out of this room
until your attitude is right.

43:49.428 --> 43:52.682
Where are you going?

43:52.723 --> 43:53.640
To the bathroom.

44:42.064 --> 44:43.106
Lizzy?

45:16.057 --> 45:18.309
Hey, how long are you
going to be in there?

46:51.318 --> 46:53.403
Tanya.

46:53.446 --> 46:54.822
Hey, Sarge.

46:54.863 --> 46:55.990
We got a call
about loud voices,

46:56.031 --> 46:57.242
yelling coming from your place.

46:57.283 --> 46:58.451
This is officer Banks.

46:58.493 --> 46:59.911
Just transferred
in from up north.

46:59.952 --> 47:01.036
Do you
mind if we come in

47:01.078 --> 47:02.372
and speak to both of you?

47:02.412 --> 47:03.956
Well all of that
really isn't necessary.

47:03.997 --> 47:05.290
Well I'd still
like to speak to you,

47:05.332 --> 47:06.166
if that's not a problem.

47:06.209 --> 47:07.085
Yeah Derek,

47:07.126 --> 47:08.502
we probably should
talk to both of you.

47:08.544 --> 47:09.796
Tanya!

47:09.836 --> 47:11.463
Excuse the mess.

47:11.506 --> 47:15.468
Wife isn't much of a home
maker, but she can cook.

47:18.136 --> 47:19.847
So I guess that makes up for it.

47:23.142 --> 47:25.060
I'll speak with
the wife separately.

47:34.153 --> 47:35.196
Hi, I'm officer Banks.

47:35.238 --> 47:37.573
Tanya, Derek's wife.

47:37.615 --> 47:39.450
You mind telling me
what happened tonight?

47:41.118 --> 47:43.245
Me and my husband just
had a little disagreement.

47:43.287 --> 47:45.080
From the looks of the
scratches on his face,

47:45.122 --> 47:46.624
I would say it's a little
more than a disagreement.

47:46.665 --> 47:49.126
You wanna tell me about those?

47:49.167 --> 47:53.213
I lost my balance and
reached out for his hand,

47:53.256 --> 47:54.339
and completely missed.

47:54.381 --> 47:55.258
I see.

47:57.385 --> 47:58.970
Were you defending yourself?

48:02.598 --> 48:04.309
Would you like to
speak in private?

48:05.642 --> 48:06.476
No.

48:08.687 --> 48:11.148
Do you realize every
time I ask you a question,

48:11.191 --> 48:12.274
you look at your husband?

48:15.569 --> 48:16.613
You're still doing it.

48:20.033 --> 48:21.910
Look at me, I'll ask you again.

48:21.950 --> 48:24.036
Would you like to
speak to me in private?

48:25.412 --> 48:28.081
No, I'm okay.

48:28.124 --> 48:29.292
We're okay.

48:29.334 --> 48:31.085
I can't help if you don't ask.

48:46.184 --> 48:47.060
Nothing here.

48:47.100 --> 48:48.102
He's one of us.

48:50.229 --> 48:52.147
You're really lucky.

48:52.189 --> 48:54.149
This officer has
clearly been assaulted.

48:54.191 --> 48:55.150
He's a good man.

48:56.276 --> 48:57.694
Make sure you're
taking care of him.

49:01.073 --> 49:03.242
Don't hesitate
to call if you need us.

49:03.283 --> 49:05.118
Thank you.

49:05.160 --> 49:08.121
You know, every time I
asked your wife a question,

49:08.164 --> 49:09.457
she would look to see
if you were watching

49:09.499 --> 49:11.167
and every time you were.

49:11.209 --> 49:15.088
If I was hitting my wife,
like you seem to be implying,

49:16.256 --> 49:18.007
why wouldn't she just
have me locked up?

49:18.048 --> 49:19.091
Man, she loves you.

49:20.260 --> 49:22.178
She just doesn't want
to see you in jail.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.763
She wants you to
stop beating on her.

49:23.805 --> 49:25.390
Like I said before, there's
nothing going on here.

49:25.430 --> 49:27.307
Banks, go
wait in the car.

49:39.153 --> 49:40.071
Listen man.

49:40.988 --> 49:42.155
This is the fourth time
we've been out here.

49:42.198 --> 49:45.660
There's never been
any charges filed, no arrests.

49:45.702 --> 49:46.828
It's one thing if
it was officer Cooper

49:46.870 --> 49:50.080
but this new guy can cause
some real problems for you.

49:51.207 --> 49:52.292
Just keep it down.

49:53.501 --> 49:55.252
It's not worth the
jail time brother.

49:55.294 --> 49:57.629
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll take care of it.

49:57.671 --> 49:58.673
Appreciate it.

49:58.714 --> 49:59.506
Ya'll be good.

49:59.548 --> 50:00.507
All right.

50:15.439 --> 50:17.316
You won't be happy till you
see me in jail, will you?

50:17.357 --> 50:19.359
If I wanted you in jail,
I would have told him.

50:19.401 --> 50:20.403
Told him what?

50:21.613 --> 50:23.531
Better be glad I
didn't press charges.

50:25.408 --> 50:26.451
But don't worry baby.

50:27.202 --> 50:31.122
I won't let them lock
you up, this time.

50:34.292 --> 50:35.418
We could be a perfect team

50:36.586 --> 50:39.339
if you had just
taken the flowers.

50:43.468 --> 50:44.385
Good night.

50:45.511 --> 50:47.430
Good night Derek.

50:55.479 --> 50:56.731
Hey, Lizzy?

51:42.443 --> 51:43.486
I love you.

51:46.071 --> 51:48.740
You know I love you right, yeah?

51:54.080 --> 51:55.999
I don't wanna hurt you.

51:56.915 --> 51:57.749
I don't.

52:02.379 --> 52:04.965
You trying to leave me hm?

52:05.008 --> 52:07.551
You're trying to leave me?

52:07.593 --> 52:08.595
No?

52:10.763 --> 52:11.973
Okay.

52:12.015 --> 52:13.600
Good, till death
do us part, right?

52:14.600 --> 52:15.767
Right?

52:17.019 --> 52:17.853
Okay, okay.

52:20.731 --> 52:25.652
I love you.

52:25.694 --> 52:26.528
Okay.

52:28.156 --> 52:30.074
Good night, good night.

53:14.702 --> 53:15.662
Hi.

53:21.792 --> 53:24.169
How could you embarrass
the church like this?

53:25.296 --> 53:26.839
How could you
embarrass me like this?

53:26.881 --> 53:28.883
I'm sure people are
already talking.

53:31.635 --> 53:33.053
What were you
thinking about Liz?

53:37.892 --> 53:40.144
Good morning Pastor Jeffries,
I'm minister Ross Day.

53:40.185 --> 53:42.729
I was just coming by to
check on Ms. Jeffries.

53:42.772 --> 53:44.148
Hi, all right.

53:44.189 --> 53:45.732
How are you
feeling today ma'am?

53:45.774 --> 53:47.568
She's
not speaking much.

53:48.318 --> 53:50.612
Feeling much better.

53:50.655 --> 53:53.658
Would you mind if I spoke
to Ms. Jeffries alone?

53:53.700 --> 53:55.993
Oh, we don't keep any
secrets from one another.

53:56.035 --> 53:58.788
It's just
protocol at this hospital.

53:58.830 --> 54:00.248
I hope you understand.

54:00.289 --> 54:03.292
I'll be right outside,
just a wave if you need me.

54:05.879 --> 54:06.963
Ms. Jeffries.

54:09.173 --> 54:12.843
Please, please
call me Elizabeth.

54:12.885 --> 54:14.803
As part of what I do
here at the hospital

54:14.845 --> 54:17.097
I have to ask you some
difficult questions.

54:18.098 --> 54:19.767
I understand.

54:19.809 --> 54:21.810
What happened last night
to bring you to this point?

54:38.995 --> 54:40.330
He can't hear you.

54:41.247 --> 54:42.080
Thank you.

54:43.790 --> 54:46.836
Last night, my husband and I,

54:46.877 --> 54:48.879
we got into a heated argument.

54:49.756 --> 54:54.969
He came in later and
he wanted to have sex.

54:56.470 --> 54:57.888
I was still upset with him,

54:57.930 --> 55:01.892
so I denied him and
he, he did it anyway.

55:01.935 --> 55:03.436
Are you saying he forced you?

55:04.812 --> 55:07.732
You make it so,
sounds so violent

55:07.774 --> 55:09.234
when you say it like that.

55:09.274 --> 55:11.276
He's my husband.

55:11.318 --> 55:12.903
It wasn't rape.

55:12.946 --> 55:14.322
We're married and um.

55:15.948 --> 55:18.867
You shouldn't be guilted
or forced into having sex.

55:18.910 --> 55:22.413
If it's not
consensual, it is rape.

55:22.455 --> 55:23.665
A husband can't rape his wife.

55:23.705 --> 55:26.291
Yes Elizabeth,
marital rape exists.

55:26.334 --> 55:28.377
Michael has never
been violent with me.

55:31.464 --> 55:34.175
I mean I wasn't in danger, I
didn't even scream for help.

55:34.216 --> 55:35.968
Well, I think this
is a scream for help.

55:36.970 --> 55:37.846
And you are in danger.

55:37.886 --> 55:39.388
If you think that the
only way to escape

55:39.430 --> 55:41.140
is to take your life.

55:41.182 --> 55:42.475
I'm not telling you what
to do in your marriage

55:42.517 --> 55:45.812
but what I will say is
that your life matters.

55:45.854 --> 55:47.897
It is important that you
take care of yourself,

55:47.939 --> 55:50.817
of your body, as
well as your soul.

55:50.859 --> 55:52.777
I can't just walk
out on a marriage.

55:55.405 --> 55:56.196
Right?

55:56.238 --> 55:57.531
I don't like divorce.

55:57.573 --> 55:59.992
But I think that
sometimes it's necessary.

56:00.033 --> 56:01.118
Why don't we just talk

56:01.160 --> 56:02.995
about that when
you're feeling better?

56:04.037 --> 56:04.997
Yeah.

56:05.039 --> 56:07.917
Lizzy, the nurses say
it's time for breakfast.

56:12.171 --> 56:15.091
I'll be around if you need
me for prayer or anything.

56:17.135 --> 56:18.845
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

56:24.600 --> 56:27.102
Well.

56:27.144 --> 56:29.188
What were the two of
you talking about?

56:29.229 --> 56:30.356
I'm tired Michael.

56:33.318 --> 56:36.153
I can eat a little breakfast,
but then I need to rest.

56:44.495 --> 56:45.455
Got a minute.

56:45.495 --> 56:47.122
Yeah, come on in.

56:47.164 --> 56:48.957
I missed you last Sunday.

56:48.999 --> 56:52.419
I was
sick, much better though.

56:52.461 --> 56:54.254
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

56:55.589 --> 56:57.216
Yeah, have a seat.

57:03.640 --> 57:07.352
So you wanted to talk to me?

57:07.392 --> 57:09.144
Well I did.

57:09.187 --> 57:11.147
Now that I'm here I
don't know what to say.

57:11.189 --> 57:13.232
Did you want to talk
to me about Faith?

57:15.276 --> 57:18.655
or Derek?

57:18.696 --> 57:20.490
Derek or me.

57:24.535 --> 57:26.537
He attacked me again.

57:27.580 --> 57:29.749
Hey, I am so sorry.

57:30.792 --> 57:32.168
Did you call the police?

57:32.209 --> 57:34.294
He is the police.

57:34.336 --> 57:35.338
Okay.

57:39.466 --> 57:41.385
There are shelters
that you can go to.

57:42.345 --> 57:46.015
They have counselors and
legal representation.

57:46.057 --> 57:47.433
You'd be protected there.

57:47.475 --> 57:50.270
I have Faith to look after,
I can't just move her to.

57:51.229 --> 57:54.189
Look, he's good to her.

57:54.231 --> 57:57.609
How good is he to her if
he's trying to kill her mother?

58:01.238 --> 58:03.282
Shelter is just not an option.

58:04.283 --> 58:06.035
Okay.

58:06.077 --> 58:07.287
So what are you going to do?

58:09.372 --> 58:11.832
Keep my head
down, my mouth shut.

58:11.874 --> 58:14.293
It's not your fault.

58:14.334 --> 58:15.336
You know that right?

58:16.754 --> 58:20.175
Abuse is about
power and control.

58:20.216 --> 58:21.551
Well, he has both.

58:21.593 --> 58:22.760
What do you need from me?

58:22.801 --> 58:24.720
Tell me what to do.

58:24.761 --> 58:28.182
Leave him, by any
means necessary.

58:28.223 --> 58:30.559
There's a safe place I can
give you information on.

58:39.234 --> 58:41.320
They can help you
with resources.

58:41.361 --> 58:43.280
They can help get
you on your feet.

58:43.323 --> 58:44.656
I don't know.

58:44.698 --> 58:46.325
Try them.

58:46.367 --> 58:48.160
Make sure you have all
your important documents,

58:48.202 --> 58:50.287
birth certificates, passports.

58:50.330 --> 58:53.290
Maybe even get a prepaid
phone so you can't be tracked.

58:53.332 --> 58:55.376
They can help you
with an escape plan.

58:55.417 --> 58:56.877
What if he kills me?

58:56.919 --> 58:57.878
I won't lie.

58:59.004 --> 59:01.840
The most dangerous time will
be when you try to leave.

59:01.883 --> 59:04.385
Take his threats seriously.

59:04.426 --> 59:05.636
If you have a plan,

59:06.763 --> 59:09.182
you can be one of the
ones that make it.

59:09.223 --> 59:10.892
I just don't know
if I can risk it.

59:12.852 --> 59:14.896
I have Faith to take care of.

59:17.439 --> 59:19.358
What would she do
without her mother?

59:19.399 --> 59:20.359
Exactly.

59:24.446 --> 59:26.698
Well, I better get going.

59:27.533 --> 59:30.452
I don't want him
wondering where I'm at.

59:43.383 --> 59:45.426
Faith honey, why don't
you to go upstairs

59:45.468 --> 59:46.886
and get out of your
church clothes?

59:46.928 --> 59:48.888
Not before you give
your daddy a hug.

59:55.687 --> 59:57.397
Where have y'all
been today sweet pea?

59:57.437 --> 59:58.606
Just to church.

59:59.982 --> 1:00:02.568
Did you go anywhere
after church?

1:00:02.609 --> 1:00:04.778
No, just home.

1:00:06.531 --> 1:00:10.827
Was mommy talking to the
deacons or her church friends?

1:00:10.868 --> 1:00:12.035
I don't know.

1:00:12.077 --> 1:00:14.496
I stay into my class
until she gets me.

1:00:14.539 --> 1:00:16.707
I was like the last
one in there today.

1:00:16.749 --> 1:00:19.794
But Ms. Sanders gave
me extra piece of candy

1:00:19.836 --> 1:00:21.421
so it was fine with me.

1:00:21.461 --> 1:00:22.463
I bet it was.

1:00:23.631 --> 1:00:24.424
Well why don't you head up

1:00:24.464 --> 1:00:27.635
to your castle
princess and change up?

1:00:27.676 --> 1:00:32.390
On the count of three, one,
two, three, go, go, go, go.

1:00:40.022 --> 1:00:41.649
What took you so long
to get her from class?

1:00:41.691 --> 1:00:42.901
First lady's been out sick.

1:00:42.941 --> 1:00:44.776
I just stopped by to
speak to her for a minute.

1:00:44.818 --> 1:00:45.986
About me?

1:00:46.028 --> 1:00:48.614
Of course not,
about church stuff.

1:00:49.823 --> 1:00:50.657
Good.

1:00:52.785 --> 1:00:56.664
You know, I have never
been shot before,

1:00:57.457 --> 1:01:01.920
but I have heard how
painful it is when it...

1:01:04.214 --> 1:01:05.089
Rips through you.

1:01:12.472 --> 1:01:13.723
Don't be so serious.

1:01:15.015 --> 1:01:16.184
I'm just cleaning them.

1:01:16.225 --> 1:01:19.436
Never know when you'll
need to use one.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:36.828
Happy anniversary, darling.

1:01:54.180 --> 1:01:58.810
Look, I know our relationship
has been rocky lately

1:01:58.852 --> 1:02:01.062
but I want our
marriage to be strong.

1:02:01.104 --> 1:02:02.522
Like it always has been.

1:02:17.327 --> 1:02:18.704
A book.

1:02:18.745 --> 1:02:20.247
Well, not just any
book, here, look at it.

1:02:21.790 --> 1:02:25.794
How To Properly Care For
And Serve Your Husband.

1:02:25.836 --> 1:02:26.920
I know it gets confusing

1:02:26.963 --> 1:02:29.089
for women to know
what their role is.

1:02:29.131 --> 1:02:30.300
And this book right here

1:02:30.341 --> 1:02:32.676
redefines what it means
to be a good wife.

1:02:32.718 --> 1:02:34.761
Here, I even highlighted
some of the passages

1:02:34.803 --> 1:02:38.932
that I thought you
might find enlightening.

1:02:43.312 --> 1:02:47.274
How to turn your not right
now's into right away dear.

1:02:52.030 --> 1:02:52.863
Oh my God.

1:03:02.457 --> 1:03:04.000
That was uncalled for.

1:03:04.042 --> 1:03:07.837
No, that book
was uncalled for.

1:04:08.314 --> 1:04:10.316
We've all been
praying for you, Liz

1:04:12.109 --> 1:04:15.363
and since we heard
about your accident.

1:04:19.908 --> 1:04:24.872
Because the severity of the
situation of what happened

1:04:27.165 --> 1:04:30.294
we think that, that you should.

1:04:32.046 --> 1:04:34.464
You should step
down from counseling

1:04:34.506 --> 1:04:37.050
until everything gets
back to normal with you.

1:04:44.975 --> 1:04:46.019
And this was your idea?

1:04:46.060 --> 1:04:49.105
You know, you've had issues
with her anxiety before

1:04:49.147 --> 1:04:50.190
and now it's the pills.

1:04:50.231 --> 1:04:52.984
My medical history is private.

1:04:53.026 --> 1:04:54.068
This is not the time.

1:04:54.109 --> 1:04:56.111
I have always
been there for you.

1:04:56.153 --> 1:04:59.364
If you can't make the
hard decisions, I can.

1:05:01.993 --> 1:05:03.119
I think
pastors just trying

1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:04.912
to do what's right
for the church.

1:05:04.953 --> 1:05:06.997
So this is about the church?

1:05:08.917 --> 1:05:10.084
Or is it about my marriage?

1:05:10.126 --> 1:05:13.213
Now Lizzy, our
marriage is our business,

1:05:13.254 --> 1:05:15.924
that has nothing
to do with this.

1:05:15.964 --> 1:05:18.425
What about the members
I'm counseling now?

1:05:18.468 --> 1:05:19.469
There's a young woman...

1:05:19.510 --> 1:05:20.969
I'll counsel her

1:05:21.011 --> 1:05:23.222
and I won't suggest that
she leave her husband

1:05:23.263 --> 1:05:25.140
every time he loses his temper.

1:05:26.642 --> 1:05:27.519
Unbelievable.

1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:29.229
Bottom line, Elizabeth,

1:05:29.269 --> 1:05:32.147
you tried to take your
own life, which is a sin.

1:05:32.189 --> 1:05:33.106
You've advised a member

1:05:33.149 --> 1:05:35.652
of the church to sin by
divorcing her husband.

1:05:35.693 --> 1:05:37.653
It's just sin on top of sin

1:05:37.694 --> 1:05:40.323
and we can't have you
leading souls astray.

1:05:41.698 --> 1:05:44.159
Elaine, can give her the card?

1:05:51.459 --> 1:05:55.088
He's a highly competent
Christian counselor.

1:05:55.129 --> 1:05:57.131
We want our Elizabeth back.

1:06:02.470 --> 1:06:03.388
You okay sister?

1:06:05.807 --> 1:06:07.642
I've been driving
around for hours.

1:06:11.562 --> 1:06:13.189
What are you doing?

1:06:13.231 --> 1:06:15.107
We're going to
pack your things.

1:06:15.149 --> 1:06:16.484
I know you're not staying now.

1:06:18.403 --> 1:06:19.611
Tanya.

1:06:21.321 --> 1:06:23.115
I don't know what
I'm going to do yet.

1:06:23.156 --> 1:06:24.325
I just need to see what's...

1:06:24.367 --> 1:06:25.410
Just stop.

1:06:25.450 --> 1:06:27.619
I don't want to hear
any more excuses.

1:06:27.662 --> 1:06:29.414
Why would you even tell me if
you weren't going to leave?

1:06:29.455 --> 1:06:31.665
Do you remember
when he proposed?

1:06:33.376 --> 1:06:36.421
He was supposed to
be this good husband.

1:06:36.461 --> 1:06:39.131
Proposing doesn't make
good husband material

1:06:39.173 --> 1:06:42.343
any more than pouring syrup on
yourself makes you a pancake.

1:06:47.390 --> 1:06:50.268
You are still so cheesy.

1:06:50.310 --> 1:06:52.353
And you love me for it.

1:06:55.772 --> 1:06:57.608
You're still gonna
leave him though.

1:06:58.693 --> 1:07:01.236
Yeah, you're right.

1:07:02.363 --> 1:07:03.573
I wasn't asking.

1:07:03.615 --> 1:07:05.116
I have her address.

1:07:06.075 --> 1:07:08.785
What, you ain't said
nothing but a word.

1:07:08.827 --> 1:07:09.661
Wait what?

1:07:10.537 --> 1:07:12.247
Oh sis, no.

1:07:12.289 --> 1:07:13.457
The Vaseline?

1:07:13.499 --> 1:07:14.500
Oh, listen, you
know, I stay ready.

1:07:14.542 --> 1:07:15.835
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1:07:15.877 --> 1:07:17.253
Now look, we're not doing that.

1:07:17.294 --> 1:07:19.630
This is not high school.

1:07:19.671 --> 1:07:21.173
I'm about to
take him to school.

1:07:21.216 --> 1:07:23.259
- Oh, do you just carry that around with you?
- You better drive this car.

1:07:23.301 --> 1:07:25.511
I'm going, I just, you just.

1:07:25.553 --> 1:07:27.388
What, where did
you pull that from?

1:07:27.430 --> 1:07:28.848
- Sweetie, come on.
- Vaseline?

1:07:28.890 --> 1:07:29.682
Well, listen.

1:07:29.723 --> 1:07:30.517
The shades?

1:07:30.557 --> 1:07:31.850
I mean come on.

1:07:31.892 --> 1:07:33.269
Oh girl.

1:07:33.310 --> 1:07:34.812
Did you have your
phone off today?

1:07:41.861 --> 1:07:44.196
Where were you, and
why was your phone off?

1:07:48.325 --> 1:07:49.202
I asked you a question.

1:07:50.495 --> 1:07:51.496
Where were you?

1:07:51.537 --> 1:07:53.997
What, you weren't
watching your tracker today?

1:07:54.039 --> 1:07:55.499
I won't to ask you again.

1:08:03.466 --> 1:08:05.801
Not too much
to say on that, huh?

1:08:05.843 --> 1:08:06.677
Why are you opening my mail?

1:08:06.718 --> 1:08:08.262
That's what you
have to say to me?

1:08:08.303 --> 1:08:09.472
I would have taken care of it.

1:08:09.513 --> 1:08:11.932
Like you took care of that DNA
test, without me knowing?

1:08:11.975 --> 1:08:14.519
If I wouldn't have come home
early, I still wouldn't know.

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:16.479
I didn't know if she
was telling the truth.

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:18.272
She has been harassing
me for months,

1:08:18.314 --> 1:08:19.440
threatening to tell you.

1:08:19.481 --> 1:08:21.441
I know you're not trying to
make me feel sorry for you.

1:08:21.484 --> 1:08:24.404
- She's crazy.
- Do not all that woman crazy.

1:08:24.445 --> 1:08:27.448
Because she wants you to take
care of your son, she's crazy?

1:08:27.489 --> 1:08:28.323
Damn man.

1:08:31.869 --> 1:08:34.747
He looks just
like you, I saw him.

1:08:34.788 --> 1:08:35.914
And I saw her.

1:08:37.667 --> 1:08:40.294
The woman you were seeing when

1:08:40.336 --> 1:08:41.796
you were working
late on Fridays.

1:08:42.881 --> 1:08:44.673
I drove by her house.

1:08:44.716 --> 1:08:46.593
Do you know how
dangerous that is?

1:08:51.471 --> 1:08:53.765
Baby.
We can start over.

1:08:59.564 --> 1:09:01.481
I'll do everything
right this time.

1:09:05.028 --> 1:09:06.404
I can't do this Derek.

1:09:08.739 --> 1:09:09.823
You have to let me go.

1:09:09.865 --> 1:09:10.824
So you're just
going to leave me

1:09:10.867 --> 1:09:11.993
after one moment of weakness?

1:09:12.034 --> 1:09:12.910
A moment?

1:09:13.619 --> 1:09:16.580
You have a whole son out there.

1:09:16.623 --> 1:09:18.625
Or maybe you're talking
about the moment

1:09:18.665 --> 1:09:20.877
I was seeing spots while
you were choking me.

1:09:22.044 --> 1:09:23.421
Or the moment I found

1:09:23.462 --> 1:09:25.130
out that I can't have
any more children

1:09:25.172 --> 1:09:27.007
because you lost your temper

1:09:27.050 --> 1:09:30.470
and kicked me till I
miscarried our son.

1:09:32.596 --> 1:09:34.890
How many more
moments of weakness

1:09:34.932 --> 1:09:36.725
do I need to overlook Derek?

1:09:47.779 --> 1:09:50.198
I'm going to fix this.
Okay?

1:09:57.663 --> 1:09:58.622
Okay?

1:10:17.141 --> 1:10:19.602
We'll just work out the
details tomorrow then, okay?

1:10:19.644 --> 1:10:20.520
Thank you brother.

1:10:25.775 --> 1:10:28.987
So I don't see dinner.

1:10:29.028 --> 1:10:30.195
Not making any.

1:10:30.238 --> 1:10:31.030
Are you ill?

1:10:31.071 --> 1:10:32.281
Nope.

1:10:32.323 --> 1:10:34.075
You care to enlighten me?

1:10:40.748 --> 1:10:44.586
Well, dinner better be
on that table at seven

1:10:45.919 --> 1:10:48.047
or I'm going out, alone.

1:10:48.088 --> 1:10:49.882
I think that's a great idea.

1:10:49.923 --> 1:10:51.341
I mean, you going out.

1:10:51.383 --> 1:10:52.760
I'd actually like
for you to stay out.

1:10:52.802 --> 1:10:54.596
What in hell's going on Lizzy?

1:10:54.637 --> 1:10:56.681
I'm filing for divorce

1:10:56.722 --> 1:10:58.725
and I'd like you out
until that happens.

1:10:59.934 --> 1:11:01.811
We're not getting a divorce.

1:11:01.852 --> 1:11:03.855
Neither of us is happy.

1:11:03.896 --> 1:11:04.855
Why would you...

1:11:04.897 --> 1:11:06.231
No.

1:11:06.274 --> 1:11:07.941
No.

1:11:07.984 --> 1:11:10.195
I will not have that
kind of talk in my house.

1:11:12.905 --> 1:11:15.742
Today was necessary Lizzy,

1:11:15.783 --> 1:11:19.870
you set me in that room, and
painted me to be a psychopath.

1:11:19.913 --> 1:11:21.247
Then you took the only thing

1:11:21.288 --> 1:11:22.956
that I have outside
of this house.

1:11:22.998 --> 1:11:24.249
And it was in
your best interest.

1:11:24.292 --> 1:11:27.086
My best interest, or in yours?

1:11:29.172 --> 1:11:33.760
It's always been about you,
then the church, then Matt.

1:11:33.801 --> 1:11:36.721
And if there's
nothing else going on,

1:11:36.762 --> 1:11:39.973
I may get your attention
for a minute or two.

1:11:40.016 --> 1:11:43.102
This, this is not you.

1:11:45.104 --> 1:11:48.316
Look, you're at that age now

1:11:48.357 --> 1:11:51.694
where your hormones
are all out of whack,

1:11:51.735 --> 1:11:53.111
and you're acting irrationally.

1:11:54.780 --> 1:11:59.785
Are you, this isn't
freaking menopause Michael.

1:12:00.954 --> 1:12:02.914
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1:12:02.955 --> 1:12:05.374
Well, then think
about the repercussions.

1:12:05.415 --> 1:12:06.959
You'll be teaching our son

1:12:07.001 --> 1:12:10.171
that it is okay to
abandon their vows.

1:12:10.212 --> 1:12:14.466
You broke our vows first,
when you didn't protect me.

1:12:14.508 --> 1:12:16.176
I'm an expert in divorce.

1:12:17.553 --> 1:12:19.972
I counsel it all the
time, I see what happens.

1:12:20.013 --> 1:12:22.057
It gets ugly.

1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:23.517
The women always regret it

1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:26.521
and the only people who
get hurt are the children.

1:12:38.156 --> 1:12:40.118
If you think you can guilt me

1:12:40.159 --> 1:12:43.872
into staying by using our son...

1:12:43.913 --> 1:12:47.417
Parents work things out,
Christians work things out.

1:12:47.458 --> 1:12:49.586
They don't just walk away.

1:12:59.137 --> 1:13:01.181
Everyone's going to
think you're crazy.

1:13:05.059 --> 1:13:06.602
You're probably
right about that.

1:13:08.187 --> 1:13:09.480
I just don't give a damn.

1:13:21.367 --> 1:13:22.243
Hello?

1:13:24.454 --> 1:13:26.039
What are you talking about?

1:13:31.543 --> 1:13:33.046
It wasn't me.

1:13:33.087 --> 1:13:35.048
Oh, try not to worry about it.

1:13:35.088 --> 1:13:36.173
We'll figure it out.

1:13:36.216 --> 1:13:38.426
I'll see what I can find out.

1:13:38.467 --> 1:13:40.093
It was beautiful,
I really enjoyed it.

1:13:40.136 --> 1:13:41.513
You did an amazing job.

1:13:41.553 --> 1:13:42.638
Thank you.

1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:44.265
I'd love for you to come
and rehearse with the choir

1:13:44.306 --> 1:13:45.557
and maybe get them
on the same page.

1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:46.559
Hi Tanya.

1:13:46.601 --> 1:13:47.435
How could you?

1:13:48.602 --> 1:13:49.479
I'm sorry?

1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:51.563
How could you all his boss?

1:13:51.605 --> 1:13:53.106
It was for your safety.

1:13:53.149 --> 1:13:54.484
My safety?

1:13:54.525 --> 1:13:57.236
And how did all of this
play out in your head?

1:13:57.278 --> 1:13:58.154
Well...

1:13:58.195 --> 1:14:00.656
He would get arrested,
he would get fired?

1:14:00.698 --> 1:14:03.409
I don't even have
a place to go yet.

1:14:03.450 --> 1:14:05.035
Okay, Tanya, clam down.

1:14:05.078 --> 1:14:06.370
I will not clam down.

1:14:06.412 --> 1:14:08.164
You told me to get
a plan together

1:14:08.205 --> 1:14:10.040
and I was working on that.

1:14:10.083 --> 1:14:11.668
You still can.

1:14:11.708 --> 1:14:15.254
You don't get to
dictate how my life goes.

1:14:15.296 --> 1:14:16.213
How dare you?

1:14:17.339 --> 1:14:19.425
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1:14:19.467 --> 1:14:23.263
Of course you didn't know,
because it's not your marriage.

1:14:23.303 --> 1:14:24.721
I was looking out for you.

1:14:24.763 --> 1:14:27.559
No you weren't, you were
trying to be the hero.

1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:30.477
You and Faith deserve better.

1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:31.687
I made a decision.

1:14:31.729 --> 1:14:33.690
And who the hell gave
you that authority?

1:14:33.730 --> 1:14:34.565
Tanya.

1:14:36.484 --> 1:14:41.489
He will kill me,
you just killed me.

1:14:43.283 --> 1:14:44.575
No.

1:14:55.168 --> 1:14:56.712
Derek, you scared me.

1:14:57.672 --> 1:14:58.548
I'm sure I did.

1:15:00.257 --> 1:15:02.342
It wasn't
me, I promise.

1:15:02.385 --> 1:15:03.511
I know.

1:15:03.552 --> 1:15:05.387
I know you didn't do anything.

1:15:05.430 --> 1:15:06.263
Come sit down.

1:15:09.516 --> 1:15:11.310
Where's Faith?

1:15:11.351 --> 1:15:13.229
With Zoey, they're
right behind me.

1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:15.356
Okay.

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:21.321
Come sit down.

1:15:35.418 --> 1:15:36.878
Derek I'm sorry, counseling

1:15:36.919 --> 1:15:39.172
is supposed to be confidential.

1:15:39.213 --> 1:15:40.422
I kept telling
you about talking

1:15:40.464 --> 1:15:41.841
to those people at
church, didn't I?

1:15:47.430 --> 1:15:49.390
I'm not pressing charges.

1:15:49.431 --> 1:15:50.682
You know, I wouldn't do that.

1:15:52.435 --> 1:15:54.604
You are so fucking stupid.

1:15:54.645 --> 1:15:56.396
Bet you thought you
could run your ass

1:15:56.439 --> 1:15:58.732
all through that church,
talking our business

1:15:58.775 --> 1:15:59.984
and that woman wouldn't run

1:16:00.025 --> 1:16:01.401
and tell the first
person she ran into?

1:16:01.444 --> 1:16:02.611
She wasn't supposed to.

1:16:06.990 --> 1:16:07.908
Yet here we are.

1:16:09.494 --> 1:16:10.495
Derek.

1:16:13.998 --> 1:16:15.792
It's fine.

1:16:17.877 --> 1:16:19.712
Really, it's okay.

1:16:43.570 --> 1:16:45.363
Don't worry about it.

1:17:07.635 --> 1:17:09.512
Why don't you tell
me about the wound?

1:17:09.553 --> 1:17:13.473
I found out that Ms.
Jeffries had called in a report

1:17:13.516 --> 1:17:15.560
on Derek for holding
his gun to my head.

1:17:15.601 --> 1:17:18.604
I talk with my Sergeant
about the other accusation

1:17:18.645 --> 1:17:19.855
and I felt like
Tanya and I needed

1:17:19.897 --> 1:17:23.568
to spend some quality
time together.

1:17:23.610 --> 1:17:27.989
Sometimes I got loud, sarcastic,
and I knew he hated that.

1:17:28.030 --> 1:17:31.117
And actually she
verbally attacks me.

1:17:31.159 --> 1:17:33.578
Most times he reminded me of
why I fell in love with him.

1:17:33.619 --> 1:17:34.745
I love my wife.

1:17:34.787 --> 1:17:38.040
Usually he works late Fridays.

1:17:39.458 --> 1:17:41.084
At least that's what
he said he was doing.

1:17:41.127 --> 1:17:44.004
I was just sitting there
watching TV on the sofa.

1:17:44.047 --> 1:17:46.507
She comes in, I ask
her to sit next to me.

1:17:46.548 --> 1:17:48.426
I wasn't expecting
him to be there.

1:17:49.761 --> 1:17:53.640
I walked in and he was
sitting in the dark drinking.

1:17:53.681 --> 1:17:56.726
I wasn't drunk,
just a little buzzed.

1:17:56.767 --> 1:17:58.602
He had one of his guns out.

1:17:58.645 --> 1:18:00.562
She starts going off about
the girls at the church

1:18:00.605 --> 1:18:02.774
gossiping about our marriage
and how upset she was.

1:18:02.815 --> 1:18:07.820
He kissed me on my forehead
and he got up and walked away.

1:18:08.445 --> 1:18:09.780
I told her not
to worry about it.

1:18:09.821 --> 1:18:10.739
He stopped behind me.

1:18:12.074 --> 1:18:13.200
I heard a crack.

1:18:13.243 --> 1:18:14.744
I even gave her a kiss.

1:18:14.785 --> 1:18:16.703
I was afraid he
was going to kill me.

1:18:18.038 --> 1:18:19.790
I think Mrs.
Anderson's injuries

1:18:19.832 --> 1:18:21.834
will corroborate her story

1:18:21.876 --> 1:18:24.628
as well as Mrs.
Anderson's own testimony.

1:18:24.671 --> 1:18:26.463
Tanya's testifying against me?

1:18:28.550 --> 1:18:29.551
She would never do that.

1:18:29.592 --> 1:18:31.719
People versus Derek Anderson,

1:18:31.761 --> 1:18:34.055
one count assault
with a deadly weapon.

1:18:36.056 --> 1:18:36.849
How do you plead?

1:18:36.891 --> 1:18:37.767
Not guilty your honor.

1:18:37.809 --> 1:18:39.142
And for bail?

1:18:39.185 --> 1:18:41.562
People request remand,
given the violence

1:18:41.604 --> 1:18:42.646
of the repeated attacks.

1:18:42.689 --> 1:18:46.276
Your honor, Mr. Anderson
is a first time offender

1:18:46.316 --> 1:18:48.069
with a daughter, he's
not a flight risk.

1:18:48.110 --> 1:18:49.528
Agreed.

1:18:49.570 --> 1:18:50.738
I'll ask just once
more, Mr. Maddox,

1:18:50.779 --> 1:18:52.614
do you have a reasonable
suggestion for bail?

1:18:52.656 --> 1:18:54.993
People ask that bail
will be set at $500,000.

1:18:55.034 --> 1:18:57.620
Your honor, the
most dangerous time

1:18:57.662 --> 1:18:59.998
in a relationship marred
by domestic violence

1:19:00.038 --> 1:19:02.749
is when the victim
tries to leave.

1:19:02.792 --> 1:19:05.003
Mortality is 500
times more likely.

1:19:05.043 --> 1:19:07.629
Mr. Maddox, do
not use my courtroom

1:19:07.672 --> 1:19:09.841
for your personal
hot button topics.

1:19:09.882 --> 1:19:11.050
You want us to believe

1:19:11.092 --> 1:19:12.719
that your client has
been abused for years

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:15.597
but she's not press charges
even one time until now?

1:19:15.637 --> 1:19:17.222
The only thing I know
about the defendant

1:19:17.265 --> 1:19:18.391
is what's on this page.

1:19:18.432 --> 1:19:22.854
His Sergeant backs him, your
client's pastor backs him.

1:19:23.770 --> 1:19:25.022
And you want me to believe

1:19:25.064 --> 1:19:27.191
that officer Anderson
is a monster.

1:19:27.232 --> 1:19:28.901
I can't do that today.

1:19:28.943 --> 1:19:31.320
Save your case for trial.

1:19:31.361 --> 1:19:34.656
The defendant will be released
on his own recognizance.

1:19:35.867 --> 1:19:37.327
Quiet!

1:19:37.368 --> 1:19:38.785
Your honor, the people
request an order of protection

1:19:38.828 --> 1:19:40.705
and that the defendant
surrender, all weapons.

1:19:40.747 --> 1:19:41.830
So ordered.

1:19:44.292 --> 1:19:46.794
Sierra and Frankie ran past

1:19:46.836 --> 1:19:48.253
their father to open the door,

1:19:48.296 --> 1:19:52.133
letting wonderful smells of
sweet potato pies, glazed ham.

1:20:01.351 --> 1:20:02.727
What are you doing here?

1:20:05.939 --> 1:20:09.400
♪ Footsteps in the night. ♪

1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:12.070
Where else
would I be, sweet pea?

1:20:13.279 --> 1:20:16.366
Mommy said you were visiting
somewhere else for a while.

1:20:21.079 --> 1:20:21.913
Well.

1:20:26.376 --> 1:20:28.293
I cut my vacation short,

1:20:29.503 --> 1:20:32.256
so I could be here
with the two of you.

1:20:33.882 --> 1:20:37.095
♪ Moon on the rise ♪

1:20:37.136 --> 1:20:41.098
♪ You say your last good night ♪

1:20:42.891 --> 1:20:44.017
Why don't you run
upstairs so mommy

1:20:44.060 --> 1:20:46.271
and I can have a
little time together?

1:20:47.355 --> 1:20:49.399
On the count of three okay?

1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:52.402
One, two, three, go.

1:20:54.195 --> 1:20:55.405
Is that okay, mom?

1:20:57.073 --> 1:20:58.449
When did you start asking
your momma's permission

1:20:58.490 --> 1:21:00.118
after I told you
to do something?

1:21:01.244 --> 1:21:06.207
I said get your behind
up those stairs.

1:21:06.665 --> 1:21:07.458
Yes sir.

1:21:20.053 --> 1:21:22.931
The judge said you can't
be within 200 feet of me.

1:21:22.973 --> 1:21:24.016
You can't be here.

1:21:31.065 --> 1:21:32.066
Yet here I am.

1:21:42.118 --> 1:21:43.369
Are you running from me?

1:21:54.172 --> 1:21:56.257
You remember when I
bought this piano?

1:21:56.298 --> 1:21:58.008
When I taught you how to play?

1:22:00.261 --> 1:22:02.055
That was a long time ago.

1:22:02.096 --> 1:22:03.181
But you remember?

1:22:05.182 --> 1:22:05.975
Hey.

1:22:14.275 --> 1:22:15.610
We can get back there.

1:22:15.651 --> 1:22:17.236
I think maybe we just
need a little time apart.

1:22:17.278 --> 1:22:18.613
I'll never touch you again

1:22:20.531 --> 1:22:23.200
in any way that you don't want.

1:22:23.243 --> 1:22:26.579
Tanya, we could be happy.

1:22:30.290 --> 1:22:31.668
Don't you trust me?

1:22:39.592 --> 1:22:41.177
What do I need to do?

1:22:41.218 --> 1:22:42.595
Nothing.

1:22:42.637 --> 1:22:45.265
Nothing?

1:22:45.306 --> 1:22:46.348
There's nothing you can do.

1:22:46.391 --> 1:22:47.642
Don't, don't.

1:22:51.229 --> 1:22:52.646
Don't say that.

1:22:52.689 --> 1:22:53.481
Okay?

1:23:14.334 --> 1:23:19.298
I loved you with everything
I have to love someone with.

1:23:21.801 --> 1:23:22.718
But now...

1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:24.137
Now?

1:23:26.806 --> 1:23:28.391
There's just nothing left.

1:23:34.646 --> 1:23:36.649
If you would've
just been there for me

1:23:37.357 --> 1:23:39.485
none of this would be happening.

1:23:39.526 --> 1:23:41.236
No fights, the baby.

1:23:41.279 --> 1:23:43.281
Wait, you're blaming
your affair on me?

1:23:43.323 --> 1:23:44.281
Yes, it's your fault.

1:23:44.324 --> 1:23:45.575
Get out of my house.

1:23:45.617 --> 1:23:47.075
This is my damn house.

1:23:49.579 --> 1:23:51.456
I hope they lock your ass up.

1:24:00.632 --> 1:24:01.466
No!

1:24:04.302 --> 1:24:05.845
Can't even breath without me.

1:24:07.471 --> 1:24:11.475
I bet you're praying to God
you dead, I am your God.

1:24:11.517 --> 1:24:12.894
I can give life.

1:24:16.230 --> 1:24:17.439
Or I can take it.

1:24:21.276 --> 1:24:22.361
Stop!

1:24:22.403 --> 1:24:25.198
Let my mama go, let her go!

1:24:25.239 --> 1:24:26.406
Get your hands off of her!

1:24:27.784 --> 1:24:29.452
Let me go!

1:24:29.494 --> 1:24:30.328
Mama!

1:24:33.830 --> 1:24:35.415
What are you doing here?

1:24:43.591 --> 1:24:44.633
Gonna work it out.

1:24:45.635 --> 1:24:47.302
In the middle of the night?

1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:50.347
You need to leave.

1:24:50.390 --> 1:24:54.310
No, this is still my house

1:24:55.602 --> 1:25:00.232
and in the eyes of God,
you are still, my wife.

1:25:01.025 --> 1:25:02.569
Get out Michael.

1:25:02.610 --> 1:25:03.820
I mean it.

1:25:03.861 --> 1:25:05.445
You said that you
would die for me.

1:25:05.488 --> 1:25:07.531
Remember that, what
happened to that?

1:25:09.367 --> 1:25:10.702
If you're not gonna leave,

1:25:10.743 --> 1:25:12.412
I don't mind
sleeping else where.

1:25:12.453 --> 1:25:15.290
Well, our son deserves
better than this Liz.

1:25:15.330 --> 1:25:16.290
You're a better
mother than this.

1:25:16.332 --> 1:25:18.584
Don't you dare question
the way I parent.

1:25:19.459 --> 1:25:20.752
Let's go take a
trip, me and you,

1:25:20.794 --> 1:25:22.713
let's go back to one more year,

1:25:22.754 --> 1:25:25.048
just a year ago when
ever we went, hey stop.

1:25:25.091 --> 1:25:25.925
Get your hands off me.

1:25:25.967 --> 1:25:26.926
Stop.

1:25:26.967 --> 1:25:28.510
- Get your hands off me!
- You are still my wife!

1:25:28.552 --> 1:25:29.636
Stop, Michael!

1:25:29.678 --> 1:25:31.513
And for this reason, a
husband will leave his mother

1:25:31.556 --> 1:25:32.473
and father, and
unite with his wife.

1:25:32.515 --> 1:25:33.975
Michael, let go, let go of me.

1:25:34.016 --> 1:25:36.394
And they will
unite in the flesh.

1:25:42.691 --> 1:25:44.526
You will never do
that to me again.

1:25:44.569 --> 1:25:45.820
Never!

1:25:52.159 --> 1:25:52.993
Come here Liz.

1:25:53.035 --> 1:25:54.078
I need help!

1:25:54.119 --> 1:25:55.412
No, don't do this.

1:25:55.454 --> 1:25:57.873
My
husband is, I need help!

1:25:57.915 --> 1:26:02.003
It's okay, shh shut up,
they're gonna hear you.

1:26:04.588 --> 1:26:05.756
Shh, shh, shh.

1:26:26.735 --> 1:26:27.569
Lizzy.

1:27:26.671 --> 1:27:28.298
Okay, okay, all right.

1:30:12.294 --> 1:30:15.088
I'm gonna give you
everything I promised you.

1:32:03.405 --> 1:32:05.617
Are we running away?

1:32:05.658 --> 1:32:06.534
No.

1:32:06.575 --> 1:32:07.577
Where are we going?

1:32:09.329 --> 1:32:10.288
On a trip.

1:32:19.379 --> 1:32:20.714
In the middle of the night?

1:32:20.757 --> 1:32:23.593
Yes baby, just, just,
why don't we just sit back

1:32:23.635 --> 1:32:25.595
and enjoy the ride, okay?

1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:29.766
Are we
running away from daddy?

1:32:31.434 --> 1:32:32.726
Is daddy a monster?

1:32:32.769 --> 1:32:35.437
No baby, your daddy
is not a monster.

1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:36.606
Okay, he's just...

1:32:37.940 --> 1:32:38.774
Oh no.

1:32:40.235 --> 1:32:41.361
Is that him?

1:32:57.834 --> 1:32:59.337
Where are
you going Tanya?

1:33:01.547 --> 1:33:04.258
What do
you want Derek?

1:33:04.300 --> 1:33:06.511
You can't
get rid of me.

1:33:06.552 --> 1:33:08.470
Turn around and go home.

1:33:08.512 --> 1:33:09.513
No.

1:33:12.432 --> 1:33:14.394
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

1:33:14.435 --> 1:33:15.979
You can't leave me.

1:33:17.437 --> 1:33:18.355
Last warning.

1:33:18.397 --> 1:33:19.815
Our daughter is in the car.

1:33:23.903 --> 1:33:26.530
Sit flat, and buckle
your seatbelt.

1:33:33.620 --> 1:33:35.414
What is wrong with you?

1:33:40.794 --> 1:33:42.337
