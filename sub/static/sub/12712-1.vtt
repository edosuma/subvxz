Our nuptial hour

Draws on apace.
Four happy days bring in

01:45.545 --> 01:49.533
Another moon,
But, O, methinks, how slow

01:49.533 --> 01:51.553
This old moon wanes.

02:06.552 --> 02:10.536
Four days will quickly
steep themselves in night,

02:10.536 --> 02:14.496
Four nights will quickly
dream away the time,

02:14.496 --> 02:17.540
And then the moon,
like to a silver bow

02:17.540 --> 02:21.496
New-bent in heaven,
shall behold the night

02:21.496 --> 02:22.560
Of our solemnities.

02:27.524 --> 02:29.548
Hippolyta...

02:29.548 --> 02:32.484
I woo'd thee with my sword,

02:32.484 --> 02:35.488
And won thy love,
doing thee injuries...

and with revelling.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.564
Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!

03:51.564 --> 03:54.524
Thanks, good Egeus,
What's the news with thee?

03:54.524 --> 03:56.540
Full of vexation come I,
with complaint

03:56.540 --> 03:59.508
Against my child,
my daughter Hermia.

04:00.552 --> 04:04.484
Stand forth, Demetrius.
My noble lord,

04:04.484 --> 04:07.480
This man hath my consent
to marry her.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.504
Stand forth, Lysander,

04:11.556 --> 04:14.488
And, my gracious Duke,

04:14.488 --> 04:17.492
This man hath bewitch'd
the bosom of my child.

04:17.492 --> 04:20.504
He hath by moonlight
at her window sung

04:20.504 --> 04:23.520
With feigning voice
verses of feigning love.

04:24.576 --> 04:29.488
♪ Tomorrow is St Valentine's Day ♪

04:29.488 --> 04:32.536
♪ All in the morning betime ♪

04:32.536 --> 04:36.528
♪ And I a maid at your window ♪

04:36.528 --> 04:41.520
♪ To be your valentine. ♪

04:41.520 --> 04:45.488
With cunning hast thou
filch'd my daughter's heart,

04:45.488 --> 04:47.548
Turn'd her obedience,
which is due to me,

04:47.548 --> 04:52.504
To stubborn harshness.
So, my gracious Duke,

04:52.504 --> 04:56.484
I beg the ancient
privilege of Athens.

04:56.484 --> 04:59.576
As she is mine,
I may dispose of her,

04:59.576 --> 05:03.516
Which shall be either to
this gentleman

05:03.516 --> 05:05.520
Or to her death!

05:10.536 --> 05:12.504
What say you, Hermia?

05:12.504 --> 05:13.556
Be advised, fair maid,

05:13.556 --> 05:15.568
To you your father should be
as a god.

05:15.568 --> 05:19.488
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman...
So is Lysander!

05:21.544 --> 05:23.500
SHE CLEARS THROAT

05:23.500 --> 05:25.548
I do entreat your grace
to pardon me.

05:25.548 --> 05:28.508
I know not by what power
I am made bold,

05:28.508 --> 05:30.552
But I beseech your grace that
I may know

05:30.552 --> 05:32.552
The worst that may befall me
in this case

05:32.552 --> 05:35.512
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

05:38.516 --> 05:40.512
To die the death.

05:43.488 --> 05:44.568
Relent, sweet Hermia,

05:44.568 --> 05:46.548
and, Lysander, yield

05:46.548 --> 05:48.548
Thy crazed title
to my certain right.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.540
You have her father's love,
Demetrius,

05:50.540 --> 05:52.564
Let me have Hermia's.
Do you marry him!

05:52.564 --> 05:54.504
HE CHUCKLES

05:58.528 --> 06:01.488
For you, fair Hermia,
look you arm yourself

06:01.488 --> 06:03.568
To fit your fancies
to your father's will,

06:03.568 --> 06:07.552
Or else the law of Athens
yields you up.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.528
To death!

06:33.479 --> 06:35.527
Ay me!
For aught that I could ever read,

06:35.527 --> 06:38.483
The course of true love never
did run smooth.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.567
Hear me, Hermia!

06:49.531 --> 06:51.543
I have a widow aunt, a dowager,

06:51.543 --> 06:53.555
Of great revenue,
and she hath no child.

06:53.555 --> 06:56.511
From Athens is her house
remote seven leagues,

06:56.511 --> 06:59.507
And she respects me as her only son.

06:59.507 --> 07:02.543
There, gentle Hermia,
may I marry thee,

07:02.543 --> 07:05.487
And to that place
the sharp Athenian law

07:05.487 --> 07:06.567
Cannot pursue us.

07:06.567 --> 07:08.535
If thou lovest me, then

07:08.535 --> 07:11.539
Steal forth thy father's
house later tonight,

07:11.539 --> 07:15.495
And in the wood,
two leagues without the town

07:15.495 --> 07:17.511
There will I stay for thee.

07:17.511 --> 07:18.547
My good Lysander,

07:18.547 --> 07:20.547
Come midnight truly will
I meet with thee.

07:20.547 --> 07:23.527
Keep promise, love.
Oh, look - here comes Helena.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.563
God speed, fair Helena!
Whither away?

07:30.563 --> 07:32.547
Call you me fair?

07:32.547 --> 07:34.559
That "fair" again unsay.

07:34.559 --> 07:37.575
Demetrius loves your fair.
O happy fair!

07:37.575 --> 07:39.571
Sickness is catching.

07:39.571 --> 07:41.575
O, were favour so,

07:41.575 --> 07:45.479
Yours would I catch,
fair Hermia, ere I go.

07:45.479 --> 07:48.519
My ear should catch your voice,
my eye your eye,

07:48.519 --> 07:51.563
My tongue should
catch your tongue's sweet melody.

07:51.563 --> 07:54.563
O, teach me how you look,
and with what art

07:54.563 --> 07:56.567
You sway the motion of Demetrius'
heart.

07:56.567 --> 07:59.511
I frown upon him,
yet he loves me still.

07:59.511 --> 08:01.563
O that your frowns would
teach my smiles such skill!

08:01.563 --> 08:04.523
The more I hate,
the more he follows me.

08:04.523 --> 08:06.555
The more I love,
the more he hateth me.

08:06.555 --> 08:09.547
His folly, Helena,
is no fault of mine.

08:09.547 --> 08:11.507
None but your beauty.

08:11.507 --> 08:12.575
Would that fault were mine!

08:12.575 --> 08:16.527
Take comfort.
He no more shall see my face.

08:17.527 --> 08:21.495
Lysander
and myself will fly this place.

08:21.495 --> 08:25.503
Helen, to you
our minds we will reveal.

08:25.503 --> 08:27.559
Through Athens' gates have
we devised to steal.

08:27.559 --> 08:30.531
And thence from Athens
turn away our eyes

08:30.531 --> 08:33.523
To seek new friends
and stranger companies.

08:35.571 --> 08:38.551
Farewell, sweet playfellow.

08:40.571 --> 08:42.539
Pray thou for us,

08:42.539 --> 08:45.539
And good luck grant thee thy
Demetrius.

08:45.539 --> 08:48.559
Keep word, Lysander.
We must starve our sight

08:48.559 --> 08:50.571
From lovers' food till later,
deep midnight.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.539
I will, my Hermia.

08:55.531 --> 08:58.555
Helena, adieu!

08:58.555 --> 09:02.547
As you on him,
Demetrius dote on you.

09:02.547 --> 09:06.523
"As you on him,
Demetrius dote on you."

09:06.523 --> 09:09.571
Through Athens I am
thought as fair as she!

09:09.571 --> 09:14.547
But what of that?
Demetrius thinks not so.

09:14.547 --> 09:19.539
Love looks not with the eyes,
but with the mind,

09:19.539 --> 09:22.535
And therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind.

09:22.535 --> 09:25.483
For ere Demetrius
looked on Hermia's eyne

09:25.483 --> 09:27.567
He hailed down oaths that he
was only mine.

09:33.543 --> 09:36.531
I will go tell him
of fair Hermia's flight!

09:37.551 --> 09:40.503
Then to the wood will
he this very night

09:40.503 --> 09:42.543
Pursue her,
and for this intelligence

09:42.543 --> 09:46.487
If I have thanks it is
a dear expense.

09:46.487 --> 09:48.547
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,

09:48.547 --> 09:52.491
To have his sight thither,
and back again.

10:10.563 --> 10:14.535
THESEUS: Love, therefore,
and tongue-tied simplicity

10:14.535 --> 10:17.567
In least speak most, to my capacity.

10:19.503 --> 10:20.555
ALL:Bottom!

10:20.555 --> 10:22.559
Good evening!

10:24.507 --> 10:25.567
God you good even, William!

10:27.531 --> 10:30.534
Good even and twenty,
good Master Page!

10:33.478 --> 10:35.526
Mistress, what cheer!

10:41.542 --> 10:43.490
Fix thy resolution!

10:43.490 --> 10:44.558
Help from Athens calls!

10:48.510 --> 10:50.518
Trust me, now,

10:50.518 --> 10:54.478
Out of this silence yet
I picked a welcome,

10:54.478 --> 10:55.574
And in the modesty...
THEY BOO

10:55.574 --> 10:58.518
YOU'VE BEEN FRAMED THEME TUNE

11:00.542 --> 11:03.498
CHEERING

11:03.498 --> 11:06.478
Is all our company here?

11:06.478 --> 11:08.518
You were best to call them
generally, man by man,

11:08.518 --> 11:10.518
according to the script.

11:10.518 --> 11:13.522
Here is the scroll of every
man's name,

11:13.522 --> 11:16.494
which is thought fit,
through all Athens,

11:16.494 --> 11:19.478
to play in our interlude before
the Duke and Duchess on his

11:19.478 --> 11:21.506
wedding day at night.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.550
Our play is the most

11:23.550 --> 11:27.482
lamentable comedy
and most cruel death of Pyramus

11:27.482 --> 11:28.570
and Thisbe.

11:28.570 --> 11:31.546
Now! Answer as I call you.
I don't know that one.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.498
Nick Bottom, the weaver?

11:35.498 --> 11:36.554
Ready!

11:36.554 --> 11:39.518
You, Nick Bottom,
are set down for Pyramus.

11:39.518 --> 11:42.518
What is Pyramus?
A lover or a tyrant?

11:42.518 --> 11:46.526
A lover that kills himself,
most gallant, for love.

11:46.526 --> 11:49.554
That will ask some
tears in the true performing of it.

11:49.554 --> 11:52.574
If I do it,
let the audience look to their eyes!

11:52.574 --> 11:54.570
Yeah, yeah - I shall move storms.

11:54.570 --> 11:57.510
I will condole, in some measure.

11:57.510 --> 12:00.502
Oh, oh... To the rest.

12:02.490 --> 12:03.542
Francis Flute, you...

12:03.542 --> 12:06.506
Yet my chief humour is for a tyrant.

12:06.506 --> 12:09.506
I could play Ercles rarely,
or a part to tear a cat in,

12:09.506 --> 12:10.574
to make all split -

12:10.574 --> 12:12.574
"The raging rocks
And

12:12.574 --> 12:15.502
"shivering shocks

12:15.502 --> 12:16.574
"Shall break the locks

12:16.574 --> 12:18.530
"Of prison gates."

12:18.530 --> 12:20.478
LAUGHTER

12:20.478 --> 12:22.558
I-I...
"And Phibbus' car

12:22.558 --> 12:24.538
"Shall shine from far

12:24.538 --> 12:26.522
"And make and mar
The

12:26.522 --> 12:28.538
"foolish Fates."

12:28.538 --> 12:30.562
CHEERING

12:30.562 --> 12:32.566
This was lofty!

12:32.566 --> 12:36.554
Yeah,
now name the rest of the players.

12:36.554 --> 12:39.502
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender?

12:39.502 --> 12:41.478
Here, Mistress Quince.

12:41.478 --> 12:43.510
Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.

12:43.510 --> 12:46.482
What is Thisbe? A wandering knight?

12:46.482 --> 12:48.546
It is the lady that
Pyramus must love.

12:48.546 --> 12:50.510
LAUGHTER

12:52.534 --> 12:54.510
To thine own self be true.

12:54.510 --> 12:56.490
You're a good man.

12:56.490 --> 12:59.558
Oh, oh, an I may hide my face,
let me play Thisbe too.

12:59.558 --> 13:02.510
I'll speak in a monstrous
little voice,

13:02.510 --> 13:04.566
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE:
"Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear."

13:04.566 --> 13:06.570
DEEPER VOICE:
"My Thisbe dear!"

13:06.570 --> 13:09.526
"I am a lady, dear."

13:09.526 --> 13:12.530
No, you must play Pyramus,
and, Flute, you Thisbe.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.566
Well, proceed.

13:14.566 --> 13:17.534
Robin Starveling, the tailor?

13:17.534 --> 13:19.478
Tom Snout, the tinker?

13:19.478 --> 13:20.546
BOTH: Here, Mistress Quince.

13:20.546 --> 13:23.514
Robin Starveling,
you must play Thisbe's mother.

13:23.514 --> 13:25.570
Tom Snout, Pyramus' father.

13:25.570 --> 13:30.486
Myself, Pyramus' mother. And, er...

13:31.518 --> 13:36.478
..Snug,
you join us, you the lion's part.

13:36.478 --> 13:38.546
And here I hope is a play fitted.

13:38.546 --> 13:41.490
Have you the lion's part written?

13:41.490 --> 13:43.482
Pray you, if it be, give it me.

13:43.482 --> 13:44.546
For I am slow of study.

13:44.546 --> 13:47.566
Oh, you may do it Extempal for
it is nothing but roaring.

13:47.566 --> 13:49.538
Oh!

13:49.538 --> 13:51.506
Let me play the lion too!

13:51.506 --> 13:54.502
I will roar that I will do any man's
heart good to hear me.

13:54.502 --> 13:56.558
I will roar that
I will make the Duke say,

13:56.558 --> 13:59.510
SCOTTISH ACCENT: "Let him roar
again, let him roar again!"

13:59.510 --> 14:02.482
An you should do it too terribly
you would fright

14:02.482 --> 14:04.518
the Duchess and the ladies
that they would shriek!

14:04.518 --> 14:06.554
An that were enough to slay us all.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.518
That would slay us.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.486
Yeah, every mother's son.

14:10.486 --> 14:12.574
No, I will aggravate my voice

14:12.574 --> 14:16.566
so that I will roar you
as gently as any sucking dove.

14:16.566 --> 14:20.538
Yeah, yeah - I will roar you an
'twere any nightingale.

14:22.502 --> 14:24.558
Listen to this. Listen to this.

14:26.482 --> 14:27.546
QUIETLY: Roar.

14:27.546 --> 14:29.502
LAUGHTER

14:30.506 --> 14:32.534
See, told you!

14:32.534 --> 14:35.494
You must play no part but Pyramus!

14:35.494 --> 14:37.546
Yeah, well, I will
undertake it, yeah.

14:37.546 --> 14:40.574
Oh - what beard were
I best to play it in?

14:40.574 --> 14:42.517
Why, what you will.

14:42.517 --> 14:46.529
I will discharge it in either
your straw-colour beard,

14:46.529 --> 14:49.525
your orange-tawny beard,
your purple-in-grain beard,

14:49.525 --> 14:52.493
or your French-crown-colour beard,
your perfect yellow.

14:52.493 --> 14:55.477
Some of your French crowns have
no hair at all.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.565
And then you will play it barefaced!

14:57.565 --> 15:01.501
SHE LAUGHS

15:08.501 --> 15:10.537
But, masters, here are your parts,

15:10.537 --> 15:12.565
and I entreat you,

15:12.565 --> 15:16.553
request you, desire you, to con them

15:16.553 --> 15:20.485
and meet me in the palace wood a
mile without the town by moonlight.

15:20.485 --> 15:22.501
There will we rehearse,

15:22.501 --> 15:25.489
for if we meet in the city
we will be dogged with company,

15:25.489 --> 15:26.565
and our devices known.

15:26.565 --> 15:29.521
I pray you, fail me not.

15:29.521 --> 15:31.529
At the Duke's Oak we meet!

15:31.529 --> 15:37.517
We will, and there we may rehearse
most obscenely and courageously.

15:37.517 --> 15:41.573
Take pains, be perfect. Adieu!
ALL:Adieu!

15:43.569 --> 15:48.513
Adieu. Adieu. Adieu.Adieu.

15:49.569 --> 15:54.541
Adieu.
Shut the door.

16:15.485 --> 16:17.561
SHE PANTS

16:37.561 --> 16:40.477
SHE SCREAMS

16:55.565 --> 16:57.545
SHE SCREAMS

17:16.532 --> 17:20.512
SNARLING

17:27.481 --> 17:29.489
SHE SHRIEKS

17:38.485 --> 17:39.521
Cobweb.

17:40.565 --> 17:43.481
THEY SNARL

17:44.545 --> 17:50.477
Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,
Come our lovely lady nigh.

17:59.477 --> 18:01.513
THEY SCREAM

18:01.513 --> 18:04.541
Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,
Come our lovely lady nigh.

18:20.553 --> 18:23.533
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania!

18:23.533 --> 18:25.505
SHE CHUCKLES

18:25.505 --> 18:27.489
My jealous Oberon!

18:27.489 --> 18:28.565
Fairies, skip hence.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.525
I have forsworn his bed and company.

18:30.525 --> 18:34.489
Tarry, rash wanton!
Am not I thy lord?

18:36.477 --> 18:40.481
Oh, then I must be thy lady!

18:40.481 --> 18:44.553
THEY LAUGH

18:44.553 --> 18:46.521
But I know

18:46.521 --> 18:48.553
When thou hast stolen
away from Fairyland

18:48.553 --> 18:51.497
And in the shape of Corin
sat all day

18:51.497 --> 18:53.532
Playing on pipes of corn,
and versing love

18:53.532 --> 18:55.552
To amorous Phillida.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.528
How canst thou thus,
for shame, Titania,

18:58.528 --> 19:02.476
Glance at my credit with fair
Phillida,

19:02.476 --> 19:04.532
Knowing I know thy love to
Hippolyta?

19:04.532 --> 19:06.552
These are the forgeries of jealousy!

19:06.552 --> 19:08.556
The bouncing Amazon!

19:08.556 --> 19:13.476
Your buskinned mistress
and your warrior love to Theseus

19:13.476 --> 19:15.504
must be wedded!

19:51.556 --> 19:57.544
And now with thy brawls thou hast
disturbed our sport.

19:59.484 --> 20:03.532
Therefore the winds,
piping to us in vain,

20:03.532 --> 20:06.572
As in revenge have sucked up
from the sea

20:06.572 --> 20:10.516
Contagious fogs which,
falling on the land,

20:10.516 --> 20:15.540
Hath every pelting river
made so proud

20:15.540 --> 20:18.496
That they have overborne
their continents.

20:19.564 --> 20:23.528
Therefore the moon, the governess
of floods,

20:23.528 --> 20:26.508
Pale in her anger,
washes all the air,

20:26.508 --> 20:29.504
That rheumatic diseases do abound.

20:30.544 --> 20:34.556
And through this distemperature,
we see

20:34.556 --> 20:40.520
The seasons alter -
the spring, the summer,

20:40.520 --> 20:44.512
The childing autumn,
angry winter, change

20:44.512 --> 20:48.568
Their wonted liveries,
and the mazed world

20:48.568 --> 20:54.540
By their increase
now knows not which is which.

20:56.528 --> 20:58.548
And this same progeny of evils

20:58.548 --> 21:02.560
Comes from our debate,
from our dissension.

21:04.500 --> 21:08.520
We are their parents and original.

21:17.504 --> 21:20.500
The King doth keep his revels
here tonight.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.572
Take heed, and you might join him
in this sight.

21:25.520 --> 21:29.504
Either I mistake your shape
and making quite,

21:29.504 --> 21:32.492
Or else you are that shrewd
and knavish sprite

21:32.492 --> 21:33.560
Called Robin Goodfellow.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.496
Are not you he?

21:36.496 --> 21:38.480
Thou speakest aright.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.544
I am that merry wanderer
of the night.

21:40.544 --> 21:43.496
I jest to Oberon
and make him smile.

21:43.496 --> 21:45.564
Your Oberon is passing fell
and wrath!

21:45.564 --> 21:47.500
Do you amend it, then.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.476
It lies in you.

21:51.544 --> 21:56.484
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?

21:57.540 --> 22:00.520
How long within this wood
intend you stay?

22:00.520 --> 22:03.480
Perchance till after
Theseus' wedding day.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.532
RUMBLING THUD

22:06.532 --> 22:10.496
Give me your hand
and I will go with thee.

22:24.556 --> 22:27.496
Not for all thy fairy kingdom!

22:28.500 --> 22:29.560
SHE LAUGHS

22:29.560 --> 22:32.484
FAIRIES HISS AND SNARL

22:33.528 --> 22:35.496
Fairies, away!

22:35.496 --> 22:39.500
We shall chide downright
if I longer stay!

22:39.500 --> 22:42.500
Well, go thy way!

22:42.500 --> 22:44.520
Thou shalt not from this grove

22:44.520 --> 22:47.536
Till I torment thee for this injury!

22:59.544 --> 23:02.476
My gentle Puck, come hither.

23:06.527 --> 23:08.503
Thou rememberest

23:08.503 --> 23:10.475
Since once I sat upon a promontory

23:10.475 --> 23:12.531
And heard a mermaid
on a dolphin's back

23:12.531 --> 23:15.491
Uttering such dulcet
and harmonious breath

23:15.491 --> 23:18.515
That the rude sea grew civil
at her song?

23:18.515 --> 23:19.551
I remember.

23:19.551 --> 23:22.527
That very time I saw -
but thou couldst not -

23:22.527 --> 23:25.523
Flying between the cold moon
and the Earth

23:25.523 --> 23:28.511
Cupid all arm'd.

23:28.511 --> 23:30.503
A certain aim he took,

23:30.503 --> 23:33.499
And marked I where the bolt
of Cupid fell.

23:33.499 --> 23:36.539
It fell upon
a little western flower,

23:36.539 --> 23:39.551
Before, milk-white,
now purple with love's wound.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.487
The juice of it
on sleeping eyelids laid

23:43.487 --> 23:46.507
Will make or man
or woman madly dote

23:46.507 --> 23:49.503
Upon the next live creature
that it sees.

23:49.503 --> 23:51.475
PUCK CHUCKLES

23:51.475 --> 23:53.539
I'll watch Titania
when she is asleep,

23:53.539 --> 23:56.503
And drop the liquor of it
in her eyes.

23:56.503 --> 23:59.499
The next thing then she, waking,
looks upon -

23:59.499 --> 24:02.567
Be it on lion, bear,
or wolf, or bull,

24:02.567 --> 24:05.523
On meddling monkey or on busy ape -

24:05.523 --> 24:09.479
She shall pursue it
with the soul of love.

24:09.479 --> 24:11.527
PUCK CHUCKLES

24:13.499 --> 24:16.531
Fetch me this herb,
and be thou here again

24:16.531 --> 24:18.555
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

24:18.555 --> 24:21.491
I'll put a girdle
round about the Earth...

24:23.527 --> 24:25.523
..in forty minutes!

24:26.563 --> 24:28.479
But who comes here?

24:28.479 --> 24:30.515
I love thee not,
therefore pursue me not.

24:32.571 --> 24:36.495
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?

24:36.495 --> 24:39.547
The one I'll slay,
the other slayeth me.

24:39.547 --> 24:42.491
Hence, get thee gone,
and follow me no more!

24:42.491 --> 24:44.499
You draw me,
you hard-hearted adamant!

24:44.499 --> 24:46.487
But yet you draw not iron,
for my heart

24:46.487 --> 24:48.559
Is true as steel.
Leave you your power to draw,

24:48.559 --> 24:50.531
And I shall have no power
to follow you.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.539
Do I entice you?
Do I speak you fair?

24:52.539 --> 24:54.571
Or rather do I not in plainest truth

24:54.571 --> 24:56.551
Tell you I do not
nor I cannot love you?

24:56.551 --> 24:58.571
And even for that
do I love you the more!

24:58.571 --> 25:01.475
But I am sick
when I do look on thee!

25:01.475 --> 25:03.479
And I am sick
when I look not on you!

25:03.479 --> 25:05.507
I will not stay thy questions.
Let me go.

25:05.507 --> 25:07.527
Or if thou follow me,
do not believe

25:07.527 --> 25:09.555
But I shall do thee
mischief in the wood.

25:09.555 --> 25:12.515
Aye - in the temple,
in the town, the field,

25:12.515 --> 25:14.491
You do me mischief.

25:14.491 --> 25:15.559
Fie, Demetrius!

25:15.559 --> 25:20.491
I'll follow thee,
and make a heaven of hell!

25:20.491 --> 25:21.567
Ohh!

25:21.567 --> 25:23.503
Oh, sorry.

25:23.503 --> 25:24.539
The dove pursues the griffin!

25:24.539 --> 25:26.539
The mild hind makes speed
to catch the tiger!

25:26.539 --> 25:28.507
Fare thee well, nymph.

25:31.543 --> 25:33.495
I pray thee, give it me.

25:43.527 --> 25:48.475
I know a bank
where the wild thyme blows,

25:48.475 --> 25:52.515
Where oxlips
and the nodding violet grows,

25:52.515 --> 25:55.543
Quite overcanopied
with luscious woodbine,

25:55.543 --> 25:59.539
With sweet muskroses
and with eglantine.

26:01.475 --> 26:05.555
There sleeps Titania
some time of the night.

26:05.555 --> 26:09.535
Lulled in these flowers
with dances and delight.

26:11.519 --> 26:16.563
And there the snake throws
her enamelled skin,

26:16.563 --> 26:21.543
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.

26:21.543 --> 26:25.531
FAIRIES SNARL

26:26.539 --> 26:28.543
FAIRIES CHOKE

26:33.491 --> 26:34.551
FAIRIES SCREAM

26:38.531 --> 26:41.527
TITANIA MURMURS IN SLEEP

27:01.539 --> 27:05.555
What thou seest when thou dost wake,

27:05.555 --> 27:09.543
Do it for thy true love take.

27:27.550 --> 27:29.506
TWIG SNAPS

27:37.486 --> 27:41.518
Take thou some of it,
and seek thou through this grove.

27:41.518 --> 27:44.490
A sweet Athenian lady is in love

27:44.490 --> 27:46.570
With a disdainful youth -
anoint his eyes,

27:46.570 --> 27:49.542
But do it when
the next thing he espies

27:49.542 --> 27:52.566
May be the lady.
Thou shalt know the man

27:52.566 --> 27:55.518
By the Athenian garments he hath on.

27:56.538 --> 27:59.474
Effect it with some care,
that he may prove

27:59.474 --> 28:03.490
More fond on her
than she upon her love.

28:03.490 --> 28:06.498
And look thou meet me
ere the first cock crow.

28:06.498 --> 28:10.506
Fear not, my lord,
your servant shall do so.

28:18.502 --> 28:21.518
When thou wakest, it is thy dear.

28:24.478 --> 28:27.490
Wake when some vile thing is near.

28:43.506 --> 28:46.542
Fair love, I faint
with wandering in the wood,

28:46.542 --> 28:50.482
And to speak truth,
I have forgot our way.

28:50.482 --> 28:53.546
Ahh! Be it so, Lysander!
Find you out a bed,

28:53.546 --> 28:56.518
For I upon this bank
will rest my head.

28:56.518 --> 28:58.542
One turf shall serve as pillow
for us both,

28:58.542 --> 29:01.554
One heart, one bed,
two bosoms, and one troth.

29:01.554 --> 29:05.474
Two bosoms interchained
with an oath,

29:05.474 --> 29:09.506
So then two bosoms
and a single troth.

29:09.506 --> 29:12.490
Lysander riddles very prettily.

29:12.490 --> 29:13.566
Lie further off yet,

29:13.566 --> 29:15.550
Do not lie so near!

29:15.550 --> 29:20.490
Amen, amen,
to that fair prayer say I,

29:20.490 --> 29:25.486
And then end life
when I end loyalty.

29:32.570 --> 29:35.526
Night and silence, who is here?

29:35.526 --> 29:38.482
Weeds of Athens he doth wear.

29:38.482 --> 29:43.510
Here is my bed - sleep give thee
all his rest.

29:43.510 --> 29:46.514
With half that wish,
the wisher's eyes be pressed.

29:54.550 --> 29:57.510
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw

29:57.510 --> 30:00.486
All the power this charm doth owe.

30:03.494 --> 30:05.566
Stay, though thou kill me,
sweet Demetrius!

30:05.566 --> 30:09.474
I charge thee, hence -
and do not haunt me thus.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.486
O, wilt thou, darling, leave me?
Do not so!

30:12.486 --> 30:14.570
Stay, on thy peril. I alone will go.

30:14.570 --> 30:19.510
O, I am out of breath
in this fond chase.

30:19.510 --> 30:23.534
The more my prayer,
the lesser is my grace.

30:23.534 --> 30:27.518
Happy is Hermia,
wheresoe'er she lies,

30:27.518 --> 30:31.506
For she hath blessed
and attractive eyes.

30:32.514 --> 30:36.526
How came her eyes so bright?
Well, not with salt tears -

30:36.526 --> 30:40.510
If so, mine are oftener washed
than hers.

30:41.538 --> 30:46.562
No, no - I am as ugly as a bear,

30:46.562 --> 30:49.550
For beasts that meet me
run away for fear!

30:51.554 --> 30:53.570
But who is here?

30:53.570 --> 30:57.498
Lysander on the ground?

30:57.498 --> 30:59.562
Dead, or asleep?

30:59.562 --> 31:02.502
I see no blood, no wound.

31:02.502 --> 31:06.482
Lysander, if you live,
good sir, awake!

31:13.562 --> 31:17.534
And run through fire I will
for thy sweet sake!

31:17.534 --> 31:21.538
Transparent Helena,
nature shows her art

31:21.538 --> 31:24.498
That through thy bosom
makes me see thy heart.

31:24.498 --> 31:27.534
Where is Demetrius?
O, how fit a word

31:27.534 --> 31:30.473
Is that vile name
to perish on my sword!

31:30.473 --> 31:32.537
Do not say so, Lysander,
say not so.

31:32.537 --> 31:36.513
What though he love your Hermia,
lord, what though?

31:36.513 --> 31:39.473
Yet Hermia still loves you.
Then be content.

31:39.473 --> 31:41.549
Content with Hermia?
No, I do repent

31:41.549 --> 31:44.489
The tedious minutes
I with her have spent.

31:44.489 --> 31:46.549
Not Hermia, but Helena I love.

31:46.549 --> 31:49.549
Who will not change a raven
for a dove?

31:49.549 --> 31:53.477
Wherefore was I
to this keen mockery born?

31:53.477 --> 31:56.505
When at your hands
did I deserve this scorn?

31:56.505 --> 31:59.477
Is't not enough, is't not enough,
young man,

31:59.477 --> 32:01.553
That I did never -
no, nor never can -

32:01.553 --> 32:04.497
Deserve a sweet look
from Demetrius' eye

32:04.497 --> 32:06.517
But you must flout
my insufficiency?!

32:06.517 --> 32:09.481
Now fare you well!
Perforce I must confess

32:09.481 --> 32:11.489
I thought you, lord,
of more true gentleness.

32:11.489 --> 32:13.549
Things growing are not ripe
until their season.

32:13.549 --> 32:16.557
So I, being young,
till now ripe not to reason!

32:16.557 --> 32:18.533
O, that a lady of one man refused

32:18.533 --> 32:20.509
Should of another therefore
be abused!

32:20.509 --> 32:22.537
And touching now
the point of human skill,

32:22.537 --> 32:24.569
Reason becomes the marshal
to my will.

32:26.565 --> 32:29.521
Help me, Lysander, help me!

32:29.521 --> 32:33.505
Ay me, for pity!

32:33.505 --> 32:36.541
What a dream was here.
Lysander, look...

32:36.541 --> 32:40.513
Lysander - what, removed?

32:41.517 --> 32:43.517
Lysander, lord!

32:43.517 --> 32:45.553
LYSANDER SPEAKS IN THE DISTANCE

32:45.553 --> 32:49.473
Lysander? Lysander?

32:49.473 --> 32:53.481
Lysander! Lysander!

32:56.473 --> 32:59.501
Here's a marvellous convenient
place for our rehearsal.

33:12.529 --> 33:15.569
What hempen homespuns
have we swaggering here

33:15.569 --> 33:18.549
So near to the cradle
of the Fairy Queen?

33:18.549 --> 33:20.505
Now, Mistress Quince!

33:20.505 --> 33:22.561
There are things in this comedy
of Pyramus and Thisbe

33:22.561 --> 33:24.485
that will never please.

33:24.485 --> 33:26.525
First, Pyramus must draw
a sword to kill himself,

33:26.525 --> 33:29.525
which you ladies cannot abide.
How answer you that?

33:29.525 --> 33:31.549
By'r lakin, a parlous fear!

33:31.549 --> 33:34.569
I believe we must leave the killing
out, when all is done.

33:34.569 --> 33:37.537
Not a whit.
I have a device to make all well.

33:37.537 --> 33:40.541
Write me a prologue,
and let the prologue seem to say

33:40.541 --> 33:42.545
we will do no harm with our swords,

33:42.545 --> 33:45.489
and that Pyramus
is not killed indeed,

33:45.489 --> 33:47.525
and for the more better assurance,

33:47.525 --> 33:50.501
tell them that I, Pyramus,
am not Pyramus,

33:50.501 --> 33:53.537
but Bottom the weaver.
This will put them out of fear.

33:53.537 --> 33:56.569
Will not you ladies be afeard
of the lion?

33:56.569 --> 33:59.525
I fear it, I promise you!

33:59.525 --> 34:02.505
Masters, you ought to consider
with yourself, to bring in -

34:02.505 --> 34:04.493
God shield us - a lion among ladies

34:04.493 --> 34:07.489
is a most dreadful thing,
for there is not a more fearful

34:07.489 --> 34:10.553
wildfowl than your lion living,
and we ought to look to't.

34:10.553 --> 34:13.536
Therefore another prologue must tell
that he is not a lion.

34:13.536 --> 34:15.569
Nay, you must name his name,

34:15.569 --> 34:18.516
and half his face must be seen
through the lion's neck,

34:18.516 --> 34:22.489
and he himself must speak through,
saying thus, or to the same defect -

34:22.489 --> 34:26.485
"Ladies," or "Fair ladies,
I would wish you,"

34:26.485 --> 34:30.473
or, "I would request you..."
Ooh, no.

34:30.473 --> 34:34.521
No, "I would entreat you,"
yes, entreat, entreat, entreat,

34:34.521 --> 34:37.565
"I would entreat you
not to fear, not to tremble.

34:37.565 --> 34:40.521
"My life for yours.

34:40.521 --> 34:43.561
"If you think I come hither as
a lion, it were pity of my life.

34:43.561 --> 34:51.553
"No. I am no such thing.
I am a man, as other men are."

34:51.553 --> 34:53.536
And there indeed
let him name his name,

34:53.536 --> 34:55.549
and tell them plainly
he is Snug the joiner.

34:55.549 --> 34:58.489
THEY CHEER

34:58.489 --> 35:00.485
If that may be, then all is well.

35:00.485 --> 35:04.497
Come, sit down, every mother's son,
and rehearse your parts.

35:04.497 --> 35:05.561
Pyramus, you begin.

35:05.561 --> 35:10.497
Now, when you have spoken
your speech, enter into that brake,

35:10.497 --> 35:13.545
and so everyone according
to his cue.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.513
Speak, Pyramus!

35:16.553 --> 35:20.529
Thisbe, stand forth!Oh, yes... Yes.

35:21.565 --> 35:24.537
No, just a little bit...
No, a little bit...

35:24.537 --> 35:29.505
Ooh, no. No, no. A little bit...
Little bit. There.

35:32.529 --> 35:36.561
Thisbe, the flowers
of odious savours sweet...

35:36.561 --> 35:39.557
Odours! What?
Odours! Odours?Odours.

35:39.557 --> 35:41.544
Odours. Odours, odours.

35:41.544 --> 35:44.504
Oh! Odours. Odours.

35:44.504 --> 35:45.512
Odours.

35:46.516 --> 35:48.472
Oh, yeah! Odours.

35:48.472 --> 35:49.528
Ha-ha! Odours.

35:51.484 --> 35:52.536
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

35:52.536 --> 35:55.520
The flowers of odious savours sweet.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.564
So hath thy breath,
my dearest Thisbe, dear.

35:58.564 --> 36:00.528
But hark, a voice!

36:00.528 --> 36:02.496
Stay thou but here awhile,

36:02.496 --> 36:04.540
And by and by I will to thee appear.

36:04.540 --> 36:06.496
And then I go...

36:06.496 --> 36:07.540
PUCK LAUGHS

36:07.540 --> 36:10.532
Oh, a stranger Pyramus
than e'er played here.

36:10.532 --> 36:12.548
Must I speak now?
Ay, marry, must you,

36:12.548 --> 36:16.536
for you must understand he goes
but to see a noise that he heard,

36:16.536 --> 36:18.500
and is to come again.

36:20.472 --> 36:22.492
Of colour like the red rose
on triumphant briar,

36:22.492 --> 36:24.508
Most brisky juvenal,
and eke most lovely Jew,

36:24.508 --> 36:27.488
As true as truest horse
that yet would never tire,

36:27.488 --> 36:29.496
I'll meet thee, Pyramus,
at Ninny's tomb...

36:29.496 --> 36:34.524
Ninus' tomb, man!
Why, you must not speak that yet.

36:34.524 --> 36:37.480
That, you answer to Pyramus.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.560
Sweet moon, I thank thee
for thy sunny beams,

36:39.560 --> 36:42.520
I thank thee, moon,
for shining now so bright,

36:42.520 --> 36:45.540
For, by thy gracious, golden,
glittering...

36:45.540 --> 36:46.560
gleams,

36:46.560 --> 36:48.556
I trust to take
of truest Thisbe sight.

36:48.556 --> 36:52.480
But stay - O spite!
But mark, poor knight,

36:52.480 --> 36:53.564
What dreadful dole is here?

36:53.564 --> 36:56.472
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?

36:56.472 --> 36:58.488
O dainty duck, O dear!

37:02.564 --> 37:05.528
Pyramus, enter!

37:05.528 --> 37:07.512
Your cue is past.

37:07.512 --> 37:09.536
It is "never tire".

37:10.564 --> 37:14.560
As true as truest horse,
that yet would never tire.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.528
He said, "never tire".

37:19.536 --> 37:23.516
As true as truest horse,
that yet would never tire.

37:23.516 --> 37:25.488
RUSTLING IN BUSHES

37:27.532 --> 37:31.476
If I were fair, fair Thisbe,
I were only thine.

37:31.476 --> 37:33.568
O monstrous!

37:36.472 --> 37:38.496
O strange!

37:38.496 --> 37:40.488
We are haunted!

37:40.488 --> 37:44.484
Bless thee, Bottom!
Thou art translated!

37:44.484 --> 37:48.524
O Bottom, thou art changed.
What do I see on thee?

37:48.524 --> 37:51.560
What do you see? You see
an ass head of your own, do you?

37:51.560 --> 37:57.520
HE BRAYS
THEY SCREAM

38:01.504 --> 38:04.488
PANICKED SHOUTING
PUCK CACKLES

38:11.528 --> 38:13.540
Why do you run away?

38:13.540 --> 38:18.568
Oh! Oh! This is a knavery of you
to make me afeard!

38:18.568 --> 38:21.520
HE CHUCKLES

38:21.520 --> 38:23.544
I see your knavery!

38:23.544 --> 38:28.508
This is to make an ass of me,
to fright me, if you could.

38:31.492 --> 38:34.516
But I will walk up and down here,

38:34.516 --> 38:38.536
and I will sing, that they
shall hear I am not afraid.

38:41.504 --> 38:45.492
♪ The ousel cock so black of hue ♪

38:45.492 --> 38:48.564
♪ With orange-tawny bill ♪

38:48.564 --> 38:53.520
♪ The throstle with his note so true ♪

38:53.520 --> 38:57.560

38:57.560 --> 39:02.564

39:16.500 --> 39:19.476
HE NEIGHS
Ooh!

39:19.476 --> 39:24.540
What angel wakes me
from my flowery bed?

39:24.540 --> 39:26.548
Good evening.

39:26.548 --> 39:31.484
I pray thee, gentle mortal,
sing again!

39:31.484 --> 39:32.524
Oh!

39:32.524 --> 39:36.508
Mine ear is much
enamoured of thy note.

39:36.508 --> 39:41.548
So is mine eye enthralled
to thy shape,

39:41.548 --> 39:45.564
And thy fair virtue's force
perforce doth move me

39:45.564 --> 39:52.563
On the first view to say,
to swear, I love thee.

39:52.563 --> 39:57.503
Methinks, mistress, you should have
little reason for that.

39:57.503 --> 39:59.495
And yet, to say the truth,

39:59.495 --> 40:02.483
reason and love keep little company
together nowadays.

40:03.487 --> 40:09.551
Thou art as wise as thou art
beautiful.

40:09.551 --> 40:13.527
Not so, neither, but if I had wit
enough to get out of

40:13.527 --> 40:16.475
this wood, I have enough to serve
mine own turn...

40:16.475 --> 40:19.519
Out of this wood
do not desire to go!

40:19.519 --> 40:23.547
Thou shall remain here,
whether thou wilt or no.

40:23.547 --> 40:26.551
I am a spirit of no common rate.

40:26.551 --> 40:30.535
The summer still doth tend
upon my state,

40:30.535 --> 40:37.487
And I do love thee.
Therefore go with me.

40:37.487 --> 40:42.475
I'll give thee fairies to
attend on thee.

40:42.475 --> 40:46.483
Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth,
Mustardseed!

40:47.551 --> 40:51.531
Ready!And I!And I! And I!
ALL: Where shall we go?

40:51.531 --> 40:56.471
Be kind and courteous
to this gentleman.

40:58.555 --> 41:01.519
Yes, your name, I beseech you, sir?

41:01.519 --> 41:03.523
SHE SCREAMS

41:07.519 --> 41:12.503
Hop in his walks
and gambol in his eyes.

41:12.503 --> 41:17.531
Feed him with apricocks
and dewberries,

41:17.531 --> 41:22.499
With purple grapes, green figs,
and mulberries.

41:23.511 --> 41:27.483
The honey bags
steal from the humble bees,

41:27.483 --> 41:32.507
And for night-tapers
crop their waxen thighs

41:32.507 --> 41:36.559
And light them
at the fiery glow-worms' eyes,

41:36.559 --> 41:41.503
To have my love to bed and to arise.

41:41.503 --> 41:42.539
'Ey up. Oh!

41:42.539 --> 41:47.507
Nod to him, elves,
and do him courtesies.

41:47.507 --> 41:49.483
Hail, mortal.

41:50.511 --> 41:52.563
I beseech your worship's name.

41:52.563 --> 41:54.483
Cobweb.

41:54.483 --> 41:56.547
I shall desire you of more
acquaintance, good Master

41:56.547 --> 42:00.495
Cobweb - if I cut my finger
I shall make bold with you!

42:00.495 --> 42:02.499
TITANIA AND BOTTOM GIGGLE

42:03.551 --> 42:06.539
Your name, honest gentleman?

42:06.539 --> 42:09.507
Peaseblossom.Oh.

42:09.507 --> 42:12.547
I pray you commend me
to Mistress Squash, your mother,

42:12.547 --> 42:15.503
and to Master Peascod, your father.

42:15.503 --> 42:17.519
I beseech your name, sir.

42:17.519 --> 42:19.531
Mustardseed.

42:19.531 --> 42:22.547
Good Master Mustardseed,
I know your patience well.

42:22.547 --> 42:26.487
That same cowardly, giant-like
oxbeef hath devoured many a

42:26.487 --> 42:28.563
gentleman of your house,
I promise you.

42:28.563 --> 42:32.559
Tie up my lover's tongue!
Bring him silently.

42:34.515 --> 42:35.539
Oh!

42:39.523 --> 42:41.479
No, no, no...

42:59.475 --> 43:02.515
My mistress with a monster
is in love!

43:02.515 --> 43:05.495
THEY LAUGH

43:05.495 --> 43:07.531
Come, come, come!

43:07.531 --> 43:10.531
Near to her close
and consecrated bower,

43:10.531 --> 43:13.527
While she was in her dull
and sleeping hour,

43:13.527 --> 43:16.479
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals

43:16.479 --> 43:18.523
That work for bread upon
Athenian stalls,

43:18.523 --> 43:20.535
Were met together to rehearse a play

43:20.535 --> 43:23.539
Intended for great Theseus'
nuptial day.

43:23.539 --> 43:26.503
The shallowest thickskin of
that barren sort,

43:26.503 --> 43:28.511
Who Pyramus presented,
in their sport

43:28.511 --> 43:30.543
Forsook his scene
and entered in a brake,

43:30.543 --> 43:33.495
When I did him
at this advantage take.

43:34.527 --> 43:38.503
An ass's nole I fixed on his head.

43:38.503 --> 43:41.547
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,

43:41.547 --> 43:46.515
And forth my mimic comes.
When they him spy...

43:46.515 --> 43:48.559
HE WHOOPS EXCITEDLY

43:51.495 --> 43:54.527
THEY LAUGH

43:54.527 --> 43:58.555
So at his sight
away his fellows fly!

43:58.555 --> 44:01.547
When in that moment -
so it came to pass -

44:01.547 --> 44:05.494
Titania waked,
and straightway loved an ass.

44:05.494 --> 44:07.498
HE CACKLES

44:09.478 --> 44:12.486
This falls out better than
I could devise!

44:32.486 --> 44:34.510
If thou hast slain
Lysander in his sleep,

44:34.510 --> 44:37.526
Being o'er shoes in blood,
plunge in the deep!

44:37.526 --> 44:39.562
It cannot be
but thou hast murdered him.

44:39.562 --> 44:42.534
So should a murderer look,
so dead, so grim.

44:42.534 --> 44:45.526
So should the murdered look,
and so should I,

44:45.526 --> 44:48.558
Pierced through the heart
with your stern cruelty.

44:48.558 --> 44:52.470
Yet you, the murderer,
look as bright, as clear,

44:52.470 --> 44:54.514
As yonder Venus in her
glimmering sphere.

44:54.514 --> 44:57.530
What's this to my Lysander?
Where is he?

44:57.530 --> 44:59.554
Ah, good Demetrius,
wilt thou give him me?

44:59.554 --> 45:02.510
You spend your passion
on a misprised mood.

45:02.510 --> 45:04.482
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood.

45:04.482 --> 45:06.566
Nor is he dead,
for aught that I can tell.

45:06.566 --> 45:10.470
I pray thee,
tell me then that he is well.

45:10.470 --> 45:12.474
And if I could,
what should I get therefore?

45:12.474 --> 45:13.538
A privilege never to see me more!

45:13.538 --> 45:15.538
Now I will follow you,
in this fierce vein!

45:15.538 --> 45:18.494
And therefore at your side
I will remain.

45:21.526 --> 45:23.494
But sorrow's heaviness...

45:24.538 --> 45:26.498
..doth heavier grow.

45:29.506 --> 45:32.534
Stay close.
This is the same Athenian.

45:34.522 --> 45:39.470
That was the woman,
but not this the man.

45:40.530 --> 45:43.542
What hast thou done?
Thou hast mistaken quite,

45:43.542 --> 45:46.522
And laid the love juice on some
true love's sight.

45:49.470 --> 45:51.498
About the wood go swifter
than the wind,

45:51.498 --> 45:54.522
And Helena of Athens look thou find.

45:54.522 --> 45:57.494
By some illusion see thou
bring her here.

45:57.494 --> 46:00.514
I'll charm his eyes against
she do appear.

46:00.514 --> 46:02.530
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE:
I go, I go, look how I go.

46:02.530 --> 46:05.470
Swifter than arrow
from the Tartar's bow.

46:07.514 --> 46:10.470
Flower of this purple dye,

46:10.470 --> 46:12.562
Hit with Cupid's archery,

46:12.562 --> 46:16.510
Sink in apple of his eye.

46:23.566 --> 46:25.514
Captain of our fairy band,

46:25.514 --> 46:26.554
Helena is here at hand,

46:26.554 --> 46:28.538
And the youth mistook by me,

46:28.538 --> 46:30.498
Pleading for a lover's fee.

46:33.470 --> 46:34.558
Shall we their fond pageant see?

46:37.534 --> 46:40.478
Lord, what fools these mortals be!

46:40.478 --> 46:42.482
HE CACKLES

46:48.514 --> 46:50.518
DISTANT VOICES

46:52.490 --> 46:54.550
Why should you think
that I should woo in scorn?

46:54.550 --> 46:59.550
Look when I vow, I weep,
my vows new born!

46:59.550 --> 47:02.526
You do advance your cunning more
and more!

47:02.526 --> 47:05.502
These vows are Hermia's.
Will you give her o'er?

47:05.502 --> 47:07.506
I had no judgment
when to her I swore.

47:07.506 --> 47:09.494
Nor none in my mind
now you give me more!

47:09.494 --> 47:12.518
Demetrius loves her,
and he loves not you.

47:12.518 --> 47:16.518
Lysander, godlike,

47:16.518 --> 47:20.474
nymph, perfect, divine.

47:20.474 --> 47:21.510
Nymph?!

47:21.510 --> 47:24.514
To what, my love,
shall I compare thine eyne?

47:24.514 --> 47:26.530
You are unkind, Demetrius.
Be not so,

47:26.530 --> 47:28.534
For you love Hermia -
this you know I know.

47:28.534 --> 47:33.506
Crystal is muddy!
O, how ripe in show

47:33.506 --> 47:37.494
Thy lips, those kissing cherries,
tempting grow!

47:37.494 --> 47:39.550
That pure congealed white,
high Taurus' snow,

47:39.550 --> 47:43.530
Fanned with the eastern wind,
turns to a crow

47:43.530 --> 47:47.478
When thou holdest up thy hand.
O, let me kiss.

47:47.478 --> 47:48.514
Kiss?!

47:48.514 --> 47:52.558
This prince is of pure white,
now seal my bliss!

47:52.558 --> 47:56.482
O spite! O hell!
I see you are all bent

47:56.482 --> 47:58.518
To set against me
for your merriment.

47:58.518 --> 48:02.474
If you were men,
as men you are in show,

48:02.474 --> 48:04.510
You would not use a gentle lady so.

48:04.510 --> 48:07.522
O, Lysander.

48:07.522 --> 48:10.526
Lysander, lose thy Hermia.
I will none.

48:10.526 --> 48:13.522
If e'er I loved her
all that love is gone.

48:13.522 --> 48:16.549
My heart to her
but as guestwise sojourned,

48:16.549 --> 48:20.501
And now to 'Sander... Ow!
..is it home returned.

48:21.533 --> 48:24.477
PUCK GIGGLES

48:30.533 --> 48:32.517
O Helen!

48:37.541 --> 48:42.537
Goddess, nymph, perfect, divine,

48:42.537 --> 48:45.529
To what, my love,
shall I compare thine eyne?

48:45.529 --> 48:48.517
You both are rivals and love Hermia,

48:48.517 --> 48:51.497
And now both rivals to mock Helena!

48:51.497 --> 48:53.533
Thou art not by mine eye,
Lysander, found,

48:53.533 --> 48:56.545
Mine ear, I thank it,
brought me to thy sound!

48:56.545 --> 48:58.549
But why unkindly
didst thou leave me so?

48:58.549 --> 49:02.473
Why should he stay whom love
doth press to go?

49:02.473 --> 49:04.521
What love could press
Lysander from my side?

49:04.521 --> 49:07.497
Lysander's love,
that would not let him bide.

49:07.497 --> 49:09.525
Fair Helena,
who more engilds the night

49:09.525 --> 49:11.553
Than all yon fiery oes
and eyes of light.

49:11.553 --> 49:14.541
You speak not as you think.
It cannot be.

49:14.541 --> 49:16.565
Lo, she is one of this confederacy.

49:16.565 --> 49:19.565
Now I perceive
they have conjoined all three

49:19.565 --> 49:22.537
To fashion this false
sport in spite of me.

49:22.537 --> 49:25.513
Injurious Hermia,
most ungrateful maid,

49:25.513 --> 49:28.485
Have you conspired,
have you with these contrived

49:28.485 --> 49:30.509
To bait me with this foul derision?

49:30.509 --> 49:32.521
And will you rent our ancient
love asunder,

49:32.521 --> 49:36.501
To join with men in scorning
your poor friend?

49:36.501 --> 49:38.497
It is not friendly,
'tis not maidenly.

49:38.497 --> 49:40.553
I understand not what you
mean by this.

49:40.553 --> 49:43.557
Ay, do! Persever,
counterfeit sad looks,

49:43.557 --> 49:46.521
Make mouths upon me
when I turn my back!

49:47.517 --> 49:51.469
Fare ye well.
'Tis partly my own fault,

49:51.469 --> 49:54.533
Which death or absence soon
shall remedy.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.553
Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse,

49:56.553 --> 50:00.469
My love, my life, my soul,
fair Helena!

50:00.469 --> 50:01.541
O, excellent!

50:01.541 --> 50:03.513
I say I love thee more than
he can do.

50:03.513 --> 50:06.473
If thou say so, withdraw,
and prove it too.

50:06.473 --> 50:07.537
Quick, come.

50:07.537 --> 50:09.533
Lysander, whereto tends all this?

50:09.533 --> 50:12.561
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr!
Vile thing, let loose,

50:12.561 --> 50:14.565
Or I will shake thee from me
like a serpent.

50:14.565 --> 50:17.525
Why are you grown so rude?
What change is this,

50:17.525 --> 50:18.561
Sweet love?

50:18.561 --> 50:21.561
Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out.

50:21.561 --> 50:25.537
Out, loathed medicine!
O hated potion, hence!

50:25.537 --> 50:27.509
Do you not jest?

50:27.509 --> 50:30.505
Am not I Hermia?
Are not you Lysander?

50:34.549 --> 50:38.497
Be certain.
Nothing truer, 'tis no jest

50:38.497 --> 50:42.505
That I do hate thee and love Helena.

50:44.469 --> 50:48.541
O me, you juggler,
you canker-blossom,

50:48.541 --> 50:50.509
You thief of love!

50:50.509 --> 50:52.485
Fine, i'faith.

50:52.485 --> 50:55.469
Have you no modesty,
no maiden shame,

50:55.469 --> 50:58.501
No touch of bashfulness?
What, will you tear

50:58.501 --> 51:01.513
Impatient answers
from my gentle tongue?

51:01.513 --> 51:05.545
Fie, fie, you counterfeit,
you puppet, you!

51:07.473 --> 51:09.517
Puppet? Why so?

51:11.537 --> 51:14.509
Ay, that way goes the game.

51:15.509 --> 51:18.473
Now I perceive
she hath made compare

51:18.473 --> 51:21.469
with our statures.
She hath urged her height!

51:21.469 --> 51:23.553
So are you grown this
high in his esteem

51:23.553 --> 51:26.505
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?

51:26.505 --> 51:29.489
I pray you, though you mock me,
gentlemen,

51:29.489 --> 51:32.525
Let her not hurt me.
I was never curst.

51:32.525 --> 51:34.557
I have no gift at all
in shrewishness.

51:34.557 --> 51:36.557
I am a right maid for my cowardice!

51:36.557 --> 51:41.501
How low am I,
thou painted maypole? Speak!

51:41.501 --> 51:43.541
How low am I? I am not yet so low

51:43.541 --> 51:46.489
But that my nails can reach
unto thine eyes.

51:46.489 --> 51:48.493
PUCK GIGGLES

51:49.561 --> 51:52.501
O, when she is angry she is keen
and shrewd!

51:52.501 --> 51:54.521
She was a vixen
when she went to school,

51:54.521 --> 51:57.541
And though she be but little,
she is fierce.

51:57.541 --> 52:00.497
Little again?!
Nothing but low and little?

52:00.497 --> 52:01.553
Get you gone, you dwarf!

52:05.485 --> 52:07.545
You bead! You... Acorn!

52:10.513 --> 52:13.533
Shall I hurt her?
Strike her, kill her dead?

52:13.533 --> 52:15.501
No, Demetrius, no!

52:16.501 --> 52:18.545
SHE SCREAMS

52:20.529 --> 52:22.493
Good Hermia!

52:24.469 --> 52:26.477
Do not be so bitter with her.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.560
I evermore did love you, Hermia,

52:27.560 --> 52:31.544
Did ever keep your counsels,
never wronged you,

52:31.544 --> 52:33.472
Save that...

52:36.468 --> 52:37.504
In love unto Demetrius

52:37.504 --> 52:39.536
I told him
of your stealth unto this wood.

52:40.564 --> 52:45.488
He followed you.
For love I followed him.

52:45.488 --> 52:48.548
But he hath chid me hence,
and threatened me

52:48.548 --> 52:51.552
To strike me, spurn me,
nay, to kill me too.

53:22.488 --> 53:24.500
INHALER SQUEAKS

53:24.500 --> 53:26.520
To Athens will I bear my folly back

53:26.520 --> 53:28.488
And follow you no further.

53:30.516 --> 53:32.532
You see how simple
and how fond I am.

53:32.532 --> 53:36.560
Why, get you gone.
Who is't that hinders you?

53:36.560 --> 53:39.492
A foolish heart that
I leave here behind.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.564
What, with Lysander?

53:42.564 --> 53:44.560
With Demetrius!

53:44.560 --> 53:47.508
Be not afraid,
he shall not claim thee, Helena!

53:47.508 --> 53:49.536
No, sir! You shall not,
though you take her part!

53:49.536 --> 53:50.556
You are too officious

53:50.556 --> 53:53.512
In her behalf that
scorns your services.

53:53.512 --> 53:56.556
Let her alone. Speak not of Helena,

53:56.556 --> 53:59.512
Take not her part,
for if thou dost intend

53:59.512 --> 54:01.512
Never so little show of love to her,

54:01.512 --> 54:02.552
Thou shalt aby it.

54:02.552 --> 54:03.560
Now she holds me not.

54:03.560 --> 54:06.504
Follow, if thou darest,
to try whose right

54:06.504 --> 54:08.504
Of thine or mine is most in Helena.

54:08.504 --> 54:12.512
Follow? Nay, I'll go with thee,
cheek by jowl.

54:13.560 --> 54:17.556
You, mistress -
all this coil is 'long of you.

54:17.556 --> 54:20.492
Your hands than mine
are quicker for a fray.

54:20.492 --> 54:23.488
My legs are longer,
though, to run away!

54:24.536 --> 54:26.544
I am amazed,
and know not what to say!

54:28.556 --> 54:30.560
PUCK GIGGLES

54:52.500 --> 54:54.520
Oh, those things do best please me

54:54.520 --> 54:57.488
That befall preposterously!

55:01.468 --> 55:03.540
But so far, am I glad
it so did sort,

55:03.540 --> 55:07.496
As this their jangling
I esteem a sport.

55:07.496 --> 55:10.472
Thou seest these lovers seek
a place to fight.

55:10.472 --> 55:13.476
Hie therefore, Robin,
overcast the night,

55:13.476 --> 55:15.556
Till o'er their brows
death-counterfeiting sleep

55:15.556 --> 55:18.512
With leaden legs
and batty wings doth creep.

55:20.532 --> 55:25.496
Then crush this herb
into Lysander's eye,

55:25.496 --> 55:28.484
Whose liquor hath this
virtuous property,

55:28.484 --> 55:31.492
To take from thence all error
with his might,

55:31.492 --> 55:33.556
And make his eyeballs roll
with wonted sight.

55:35.552 --> 55:38.500
When they next wake,
all this derision

55:38.500 --> 55:41.548
Shall seem a dream
and fruitless vision.

55:41.548 --> 55:45.512
Whiles I in this affair
do thee employ

55:45.512 --> 55:50.548
I'll to my queen
and find her sleeping, boy,

55:50.548 --> 55:53.536
And then I will her charmed
eye release

55:53.536 --> 55:59.492
From monster's view,
and all things shall be peace.

56:07.500 --> 56:13.488
DEMETRIUS:Thou runaway!
Thou coward! Art thou fled?

56:13.488 --> 56:19.488
Speak! In some bush?
Where dost thou hide thy head?

56:21.496 --> 56:25.536
Oh! Faintness...constraineth me.

56:28.472 --> 56:29.528
PUCK: Constraineth me.

56:39.559 --> 56:42.535
Fallen am I, in dark uneven way.

56:48.523 --> 56:52.519
O weary night!
O long and tedious night...

56:52.519 --> 56:55.495
Sleep, that sometimes shuts up.

56:59.523 --> 57:01.559
Never so weary, never so in woe...

57:06.559 --> 57:09.507
Cupid is a knavish lad

57:09.507 --> 57:12.527
Thus to make poor females mad.

57:12.527 --> 57:14.523
I have one. Come three more,

57:14.523 --> 57:17.475
Two of both kinds make up four.

57:22.467 --> 57:23.547
When thou wakest,

57:23.547 --> 57:25.491
Thou takest

57:25.491 --> 57:26.531
True delight

57:26.531 --> 57:27.555
In the sight

57:27.555 --> 57:30.539
Of thy former lady's eye.

57:33.491 --> 57:35.471
Jack shall have Jill,

57:35.471 --> 57:36.559
Nought shall go ill.

57:36.559 --> 57:41.555
The man shall have his mare again,
and all shall be well.

57:43.551 --> 57:45.543
BOTTOM:Ohh!

57:45.543 --> 57:49.483
TITANIA: I will purge thy mortal
grossness so.

57:52.475 --> 57:54.479
TITANIA AND BOTTOM GIGGLE

57:57.539 --> 58:00.483
Ahh...

58:00.483 --> 58:05.491
Come, sit thee down
upon this flowery bed

58:05.491 --> 58:10.479
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,

58:10.479 --> 58:15.519
And stick muskroses in thy sleek,
smooth head,

58:15.519 --> 58:20.519
And kiss thy fair large...ears...

58:25.491 --> 58:27.511
..my gentle joy.

58:27.511 --> 58:28.559
Ugh...

58:31.555 --> 58:33.483
Ah.

58:34.483 --> 58:36.499
Where's Peaseblossom?

58:36.499 --> 58:37.535
Ready.

58:37.535 --> 58:39.559
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.

58:46.515 --> 58:48.563
Where's Monsieur Cobweb?

58:48.563 --> 58:50.531
Ready.

58:50.531 --> 58:53.527
Good Monsieur,
bring me a honey bag, signior.

58:57.527 --> 58:59.539
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed?

59:01.507 --> 59:02.551
What's your will?

59:02.551 --> 59:05.531
Nothing, good Monsieur,
but to help Peaseblossom

59:05.531 --> 59:06.551
to scratch.

59:08.535 --> 59:11.523
I must to the barber's,
Monsieur, for methinks

59:11.523 --> 59:15.467
I am marvellous hairy
about the face.

59:15.467 --> 59:20.471
Now say, sweet love,
what thou desirest to eat.

59:22.483 --> 59:27.483
Truly, a peck of provender.
I could munch your good dry oats.

59:27.483 --> 59:31.531
Methinks I have a great desire
to a bottle of hay.

59:31.531 --> 59:34.559
Good hay,
sweet hay hath no fellow.

59:36.527 --> 59:39.503
I have a venturous fairy shall seek

59:39.503 --> 59:45.503
The squirrel's hoard,
and fetch thee new nuts.

59:47.543 --> 59:50.523
I had rather have a handful
or two of dried pease.

59:53.559 --> 59:57.535
But, I pray you,
let none of your people stir me.

59:57.535 --> 01:00:01.539
I have an exposition of sleep
come upon me.

01:00:01.539 --> 01:00:03.495
HE YAWNS

01:00:03.495 --> 01:00:08.559
Sleep thou,
and I will wind thee in my arms.

01:00:11.551 --> 01:00:15.515
Fairies, be gone,
and be all ways away.

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:23.475
So doth the woodbine the sweet
honeysuckle

01:00:23.475 --> 01:00:26.563
Gently entwist, the female ivy so

01:00:26.563 --> 01:00:31.479
Enrings the barky fingers
of the elm.

01:00:31.479 --> 01:00:34.555
O, how I love thee!

01:00:34.555 --> 01:00:37.475
How I dote on thee!

01:00:47.555 --> 01:00:49.491
FLATULENCE

01:00:50.519 --> 01:00:55.514
Her dotage now I do
begin to pity.

01:00:55.514 --> 01:00:58.494
THEY CHUCKLE

01:01:01.498 --> 01:01:04.550
Be as thou wast wont to be,

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:08.538
See as thou wast wont to see.

01:01:08.538 --> 01:01:11.526
Now, my Titania,

01:01:11.526 --> 01:01:14.490
wake you, my sweet queen!

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:27.490
Oh!

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:31.510
My Oberon, what visions have I seen!

01:01:32.562 --> 01:01:36.494
Methought I was enamoured of an ass.

01:01:36.494 --> 01:01:37.518
There lies your love.

01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:44.498
How came these things to pass?

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:49.510
O, how mine eyes
do loathe your visage now!

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:54.482
But thou and I are new in amity,

01:01:54.482 --> 01:01:56.562
And will tomorrow midnight solemnly

01:01:56.562 --> 01:02:00.466
Dance in Duke Theseus's
house triumphantly,

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:04.498
And bring to that lord
his true destiny.

01:02:04.498 --> 01:02:10.538
Fairy king, attend, and mark,
I do hear the morning lark.

01:02:10.538 --> 01:02:14.506
Then, my queen, in silence sad,

01:02:14.506 --> 01:02:17.474
Trip we after the night's shade.

01:02:17.474 --> 01:02:19.482
We the globe can compass soon,

01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:21.506
Swifter than the wandering moon.

01:02:21.506 --> 01:02:23.542
We are spirits of another sort.

01:02:23.542 --> 01:02:27.502
And I with the morning's love have
oft made sport,

01:02:27.502 --> 01:02:29.534
And like a forester the groves
may tread

01:02:29.534 --> 01:02:32.522
Even till the eastern
gate all fiery red

01:02:32.522 --> 01:02:36.502
Opening on Neptune with fair
blessed beams

01:02:36.502 --> 01:02:40.522
Turns into yellow gold his salt
green streams...

01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:00.558
But soft, what nymphs are these?

01:03:04.554 --> 01:03:06.502
Pardon, my lord!

01:03:06.502 --> 01:03:07.558
No doubt you rose up early
to observe

01:03:07.558 --> 01:03:11.530
The rite of May, and hearing
our intent

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:13.558
Came here in grace of
our solemnity.

01:03:15.486 --> 01:03:17.506
But speak, Egeus.
Is not this the day

01:03:17.506 --> 01:03:19.558
That Hermia should give
answer of her choice?

01:03:19.558 --> 01:03:21.526
It is, my lord.

01:03:23.526 --> 01:03:25.486
I pray you all, stand up.

01:03:27.526 --> 01:03:29.494
I know you two are rival enemies.

01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:32.510
How comes this gentle
concord in the world?

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:36.558
My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
Half sleep, half waking.

01:03:36.558 --> 01:03:37.562
But as yet, I swear...

01:03:37.562 --> 01:03:41.534
Enough, enough. My lord,
you have enough!

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:45.530
I beg the law,
the law upon his head!

01:03:47.482 --> 01:03:48.542
They would have stolen away,

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:50.562
But...They would, Demetrius,

01:03:50.562 --> 01:03:55.470
Thereby to have defeated you and me.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:57.494
My good lord -
I wot not by what power,

01:03:57.494 --> 01:04:01.482
But by some power it is -
my love to Hermia,

01:04:01.482 --> 01:04:04.502
Melted as the snow, seems to me now

01:04:04.502 --> 01:04:06.498
As the remembrance
of an idle gaud

01:04:06.498 --> 01:04:08.510
Which in my childhood I did
dote upon.

01:04:09.514 --> 01:04:12.522
And all the faith,
the virtue of my heart,

01:04:12.522 --> 01:04:14.534
The object and the pleasure of
mine eye,

01:04:14.534 --> 01:04:17.482
Is only...Helena.

01:04:24.558 --> 01:04:27.538
Egeus, I will overbear your will.

01:04:27.538 --> 01:04:29.514
For in the temple by and by with us

01:04:29.514 --> 01:04:31.542
These couples shall
eternally be knit.

01:04:34.478 --> 01:04:36.466
And - for the morning now is
something worn -

01:04:36.466 --> 01:04:38.494
Our purposed hunting
shall be set aside.

01:04:38.494 --> 01:04:41.486
Away with us to Athens.
Three and three,

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:43.554
We'll hold a feast
in great solemnity.

01:04:43.554 --> 01:04:46.510
Uncouple in the western valley!
Let them go!

01:04:57.538 --> 01:05:00.486
These things seem small
and undistinguishable,

01:05:00.486 --> 01:05:03.549
Like far-off mountains
turned into clouds.

01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:06.505
It seems to me,
that yet we sleep, we dream...

01:05:18.533 --> 01:05:20.489
HE GROANS

01:05:23.469 --> 01:05:24.521
Heigh ho!

01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:28.489
Mistress Quince!

01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:30.501
Flute...?

01:05:30.501 --> 01:05:31.533
Er...

01:05:31.533 --> 01:05:35.513
God's my life - stolen hence
and left me asleep!

01:05:40.505 --> 01:05:43.557
I've had a most rare vision.

01:05:43.557 --> 01:05:47.561
I have had a dream past the wit
of man to say what dream it was...

01:05:49.525 --> 01:05:51.473
Methought I was...

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:54.505
there is no man can tell what.

01:05:55.509 --> 01:05:56.521
No, methought I was...

01:05:58.525 --> 01:06:00.525
methought I...

01:06:00.525 --> 01:06:03.525
Oh! Man is but a patched fool
if he will offer to say

01:06:03.525 --> 01:06:04.541
what my dream was...

01:06:07.509 --> 01:06:10.509
and I...and she...

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:11.561
Oooh...

01:06:16.493 --> 01:06:21.489
I will get Mistress Quince to write
the ballad of this dream. Yes, yes.

01:06:21.489 --> 01:06:23.521
It shall be called Bottom's Dream,

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:25.497
for it hath no bottom.

01:06:25.497 --> 01:06:29.521
And I will sing it in the latter end
of the play! Before the Duke!

01:06:29.521 --> 01:06:31.493
THE PLAY! THE DUKE!

01:06:31.493 --> 01:06:32.509
Oh! Oooh!

01:06:41.537 --> 01:06:45.485
CROWD CHANT: Theseus! Theseus!

01:06:52.485 --> 01:06:53.537
Where are these lads?!

01:06:56.493 --> 01:06:58.553
Bottom!

01:06:58.553 --> 01:07:00.529
Where are these hearts?!

01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:04.541
O most courageous day!

01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:06.541
We are transported!

01:07:12.509 --> 01:07:17.485
CROWD CHEER

01:07:17.485 --> 01:07:20.497
O most happy hour!

01:07:21.509 --> 01:07:24.477
The old mechanicals!

01:07:29.473 --> 01:07:32.513
Get your apparel!
Good strings! New ribbons!

01:07:32.513 --> 01:07:35.473
The Duke hath dined!
The Duke hath dined!!

01:07:38.545 --> 01:07:41.513
FIREWORKS CRACKLE

01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:11.493
Here come the lovers,
full of joy...

01:08:13.529 --> 01:08:15.477
..and mirth!

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.520
APPLAUSE CONTINUES

01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:52.537
Methinks I see these things
with parted eye,

01:08:52.537 --> 01:08:54.517
When everything seems double.

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:57.549
So methinks,

01:08:57.549 --> 01:09:01.505
Now I have found Demetrius,
like a jewel,

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:04.509
Mine own but not mine own.

01:09:04.509 --> 01:09:06.501
Are you sure, that we are...?

01:09:08.517 --> 01:09:12.481
'Tis strange, O Theseus, that these
lovers speak of.

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.493
More strange than true.

01:09:14.493 --> 01:09:15.515
I never may believe

01:09:15.515 --> 01:09:19.532
These antique fables, nor these
fairy toys.

01:09:19.532 --> 01:09:22.488
Lovers and madmen have such
seething brains,

01:09:22.488 --> 01:09:24.511
Such shaping fantasies,
that apprehend

01:09:24.511 --> 01:09:27.504
More than cool reason
ever comprehends.

01:09:27.504 --> 01:09:29.551
So in the night,
imagining some fear,

01:09:29.551 --> 01:09:32.536
How easy is a bush supposed a bear?

01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:35.511
But all the story of the night
told over.

01:09:44.515 --> 01:09:46.488
GUNS CLICK

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.472
What revels are in hand?

01:10:00.472 --> 01:10:03.524
Is there no play To ease the
anguish of a torturing hour?

01:10:03.524 --> 01:10:06.488
There's a brief how many
sports are ripe.

01:10:06.488 --> 01:10:08.532
What masques,

01:10:08.532 --> 01:10:11.552
what...what dances shall we have?

01:10:11.552 --> 01:10:14.480
HE SIGHS AND LAUGHS SCATHINGLY

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.500
"A tedious brief scene of
young Pyramus

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.492
"And his love Thisbe -
very tragical mirth."

01:10:19.492 --> 01:10:20.504
Ha!

01:10:21.536 --> 01:10:23.496
Merry and tragical?

01:10:23.496 --> 01:10:24.536
HE LAUGHS SCATHINGLY

01:10:24.536 --> 01:10:27.484
Tedious and brief? Ha!

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:30.504
N-No, no, my noble lord,
It's... It's not for you.

01:10:31.504 --> 01:10:32.532
We will hear it.

01:10:43.492 --> 01:10:44.496
Ha!

01:10:44.496 --> 01:10:46.480
Hard-handed folk that
work in Athens here,

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.540
Which never laboured
in their minds till now.

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.548
APPLAUSE

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:57.500
Oh...

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.472
HE SCOFFS

01:11:03.512 --> 01:11:07.504
If we offend
it is with our good will.

01:11:09.508 --> 01:11:12.488
That you should think we come
not to offend

01:11:12.488 --> 01:11:14.496
But with good will

01:11:15.508 --> 01:11:18.476
To show our simple skill,

01:11:18.476 --> 01:11:21.500
That is the true
beginning of our end.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:27.544
Consider then we come...
but in despite.

01:11:27.544 --> 01:11:31.472
We do not come as minding
to content you,

01:11:31.472 --> 01:11:32.544
Our true intent is.

01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:36.560
All for your delight
We are not here.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.524
That you should here repent you.

01:11:42.544 --> 01:11:46.484
The actors are at hand,

01:11:46.484 --> 01:11:47.536
and by their show

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:52.484
You shall know all
that you are like to know.

01:11:59.512 --> 01:12:03.508
She hath rid her prologue like a
rough colt, she knows not the stop.

01:12:03.508 --> 01:12:04.536
SOME LAUGHTER

01:12:04.536 --> 01:12:06.520
Her speech was like
a tangled chain -

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.484
Nothing impaired,
but all disordered.

01:12:09.484 --> 01:12:11.556
SOME LAUGHTER

01:12:11.556 --> 01:12:13.556
Who is next?

01:12:13.556 --> 01:12:16.532
GRUNTING AND GROANING

01:12:24.532 --> 01:12:28.532
HE GRUNTS AND GROANS

01:12:31.516 --> 01:12:34.556
GROANING SLOWLY DIES DOWN

01:12:36.476 --> 01:12:37.520
HE SCOFFS

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.508
In this same interlude it
doth befall

01:12:42.508 --> 01:12:46.532
That I - one Snout by name
- present a wall.

01:12:46.532 --> 01:12:49.528
And such a wall as I would
have you think

01:12:49.528 --> 01:12:53.500
That had in it a crannied
hole or chink,

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.548
Through which the lovers,
Pyramus and Thisbe,

01:12:56.548 --> 01:13:00.512
Did whisper often, very secretly.

01:13:00.512 --> 01:13:04.496
This loam, this roughcast,
and this stone doth show

01:13:04.496 --> 01:13:09.488
That I am that same wall -
the truth is so.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.468
BOTTOM MURMURS APPRECIATIVELY

01:13:15.468 --> 01:13:16.512
Very good.

01:13:16.512 --> 01:13:22.524
O grim-looked night,
O night with hue so black,

01:13:22.524 --> 01:13:26.543
O night which ever art
when day is not!

01:13:26.543 --> 01:13:31.515
O night, O night, alack,
alack, alack,

01:13:31.515 --> 01:13:34.527
I fear my Thisbe's promise
is forgot!

01:13:34.527 --> 01:13:39.519
And thou, O wall, O sweet,
O lovely wall,

01:13:39.519 --> 01:13:43.555
Which standest between
her father's ground and mine,

01:13:43.555 --> 01:13:49.467
Thou wall, O wall,
O sweet and lovely wall,

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:52.531
Show me thy chink to blink
through with mine eyne.

01:13:52.531 --> 01:13:55.467
GRUNTING

01:13:55.467 --> 01:13:57.483
THESEUS SCOFFS
Thanks, courteous wall.

01:13:57.483 --> 01:14:00.463
Jove shield thee well for this.

01:14:01.539 --> 01:14:05.547
What see I? No Thisbe do I see.

01:14:05.547 --> 01:14:09.519
O wicked wall,
through whom I see no bliss,

01:14:09.519 --> 01:14:12.511
Cursed be thy stones for thus
deceiving me!

01:14:12.511 --> 01:14:15.527
The wall, methinks, being sensible,
should curse again.

01:14:15.527 --> 01:14:18.507
OUT OF CHARACTER: No, in truth, sir,
he should not.

01:14:18.507 --> 01:14:20.471
MURMURING

01:14:22.487 --> 01:14:25.519
"Deceiving me" is Thisbe's cue.
She is to enter now,

01:14:25.519 --> 01:14:28.555
and I am to spy her through
the wall.(Bottom!)

01:14:28.555 --> 01:14:31.551
You shall see - it will fall pat
as I told you.(No, no, Bottom...)

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:33.495
Yonder she comes.

01:14:33.495 --> 01:14:34.523
(Bottom, Bottom!)

01:14:35.539 --> 01:14:37.503
IN CHARACTER: Yonder she comes!

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:42.503
FLUTE:Oh, where is Pyramus,
most lilywhite of hue?

01:14:44.499 --> 01:14:47.495
O, wall,
full often hast thou heard my moans

01:14:47.495 --> 01:14:50.471
For parting my fair Pyramus and me.

01:14:50.471 --> 01:14:52.543
My cherry lips have often
kiss'd thy stones,

01:14:52.543 --> 01:14:56.495
Thy stones with lime
and hair knit up in thee.

01:14:56.495 --> 01:14:58.499
I see a voice.
Now will I to the chink

01:14:58.499 --> 01:15:00.531
To spy an I can
hear my Thisbe's face.

01:15:02.527 --> 01:15:03.535
Thisbe!

01:15:03.535 --> 01:15:06.503
FLUTE GASPS
My love!

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:08.527
Thou art my love, II think?

01:15:08.527 --> 01:15:12.471
O, kiss me through the hole of this
vile wall!All right.

01:15:12.471 --> 01:15:15.503
OUT OF CHARACTER: Nah, I can't really do it.
I can't do it, I can't do it.

01:15:15.503 --> 01:15:18.483
I-I kiss the wall's hole,
not your lips at all.

01:15:18.483 --> 01:15:21.483
IN CHARACTER: Wilt thou
at Ninny's Tomb..."Ninus'."

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:23.491
..Ninus' Tomb meet me straight way?

01:15:23.491 --> 01:15:26.479
Tide life, tide death,
I come without delay.

01:15:27.527 --> 01:15:30.495
OUT OF CHARACTER: Ninus' tomb,
I know. I always get... I know.

01:15:30.495 --> 01:15:34.491
Thus have I, wall,
my part discharged so,

01:15:34.491 --> 01:15:37.535
And being done,
thus wall away doth go.

01:15:37.535 --> 01:15:40.503
HE GRUNTS
Right...

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:45.491
GRUNTING AND GROANING

01:15:45.491 --> 01:15:47.519
Thank you...thank you...

01:15:49.495 --> 01:15:52.463
Argh, argh! Ooh! Ooh, me finger...

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:56.511
This is the silliest stuff
that I have ever heard!

01:15:56.511 --> 01:15:57.555
Ha!

01:15:57.555 --> 01:15:59.547
I wonder if the lion be to speak.

01:15:59.547 --> 01:16:02.543
One lion may, when many asses do!

01:16:05.467 --> 01:16:08.527
You, ladies -
you whose gentle hearts do fear

01:16:08.527 --> 01:16:12.555
The smallest monstrous mouse
that creeps on floor

01:16:12.555 --> 01:16:16.539
May now, perchance,
both quake and tremble here,

01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:20.531
When lion rough in wildest
rage doth ROAR!

01:16:22.483 --> 01:16:25.479
Then know that
I as Snug the joiner am.

01:16:25.479 --> 01:16:28.483
OUT OF CHARACTER: It's me,
I'm...I'm Snug. I'm Sn...

01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:30.507
(Get on with it!)

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:34.495
IN CHARACTER: A-A lion fell,
nor else no lion's dam,

01:16:34.495 --> 01:16:37.543
For if I should as lion
come in strife

01:16:37.543 --> 01:16:41.523
Into this place,
'twere pity on my life.

01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:47.543
This lanthorn doth the horned
moon present...

01:16:47.543 --> 01:16:50.507
He should have worn
the horns on his head.

01:16:56.467 --> 01:17:00.467
This lanthorn doth the horned
moon present...

01:17:00.467 --> 01:17:04.487
He is no crescent! And his horns are
invisible within the circumference.

01:17:04.487 --> 01:17:06.543
This lanthorn doth
the horned moon present -

01:17:06.543 --> 01:17:10.483
Myself the man in the moon
do seem to be.

01:17:10.483 --> 01:17:12.547
Ah, this is the greatest
error of all the rest.

01:17:12.547 --> 01:17:15.515
The man should be IN the lantern.
How is it else the man in the moon?

01:17:15.515 --> 01:17:18.507
All I have to say is to tell you
this lantern is the moon,

01:17:18.507 --> 01:17:22.467
I am the man in the moon,
this thorn bush my thorn bush,

01:17:22.467 --> 01:17:24.495
and this dog my dog.
PUPPET SQUEAKS

01:17:24.495 --> 01:17:26.487
MURMURING

01:17:33.511 --> 01:17:36.543
This is old Ninny's Tomb.
(Ninus'! Ugh!)

01:17:36.543 --> 01:17:38.498
But-But where is my love?

01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:40.546
O!

01:17:40.546 --> 01:17:43.474
FLUTE SHRIEKS

01:17:43.474 --> 01:17:45.466
Rarrrrrr!

01:17:45.466 --> 01:17:48.542
Ha! Well roared, lion!
Well run, Thisbe!

01:17:51.522 --> 01:17:53.502
Well shone, moon!

01:17:54.538 --> 01:17:56.518
Well moused, lion!

01:17:56.518 --> 01:17:57.522
Ha!

01:17:59.498 --> 01:18:02.530
Ah - and then came Pyramus.
And so the lion vanished!

01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:04.526
HE LAUGHS

01:18:09.462 --> 01:18:13.510
Sweet moon, I thank
thee for thy sunny beams.

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:17.498
I thank thee, moon,
for shining now so bright.

01:18:17.498 --> 01:18:20.558
For, by thy gracious, golden,
glittering gleams,

01:18:20.558 --> 01:18:23.542
I trust to take of truest
Thisbe sight.

01:18:25.526 --> 01:18:29.514
But stay - O, spite!
But mark, poor knight,

01:18:29.514 --> 01:18:31.522
What dreadful dole is here?

01:18:31.522 --> 01:18:33.558
Eyes, do you see?

01:18:33.558 --> 01:18:39.466
How can it be?
O, dainty duck, O, dear!

01:18:39.466 --> 01:18:44.498
Thy mantle good -
What, stained with blood!

01:18:44.498 --> 01:18:46.530
Approach, ye Furies fell!

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:48.510
SOME LAUGHTER

01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:51.486
O, Fates, come, come,

01:18:51.486 --> 01:18:53.498
Cut thread and thrum,

01:18:53.498 --> 01:18:56.530
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell.

01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:57.554
HE LAUGHS

01:18:57.554 --> 01:19:00.506
Beshrew my heart,
but I pity the man!

01:19:02.546 --> 01:19:06.494
Come, tears, confound.

01:19:06.494 --> 01:19:10.514
Out sword, and wound
The pap of Pyramus.

01:19:10.514 --> 01:19:13.498
Ay, that left pap,

01:19:13.498 --> 01:19:16.530
Where heart doth hop.

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:19.534
Thus die I -

01:19:19.534 --> 01:19:21.466
thus!

01:19:22.498 --> 01:19:24.502
LAUGHTER
Thus!

01:19:24.502 --> 01:19:26.498
HE LAUGHS HEARTILY
Thus!

01:19:26.498 --> 01:19:29.490
Thus! Thus!

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:31.542
HE LAUGHS, THEN GRUNTS

01:19:31.542 --> 01:19:33.466
Thus!

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:39.558
Now am I dead,

01:19:39.558 --> 01:19:42.510
Now am I fled.

01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:47.514
My soul is in the sky.

01:19:47.514 --> 01:19:49.558
Tongue, lose thy light.

01:19:49.558 --> 01:19:53.486
Moon, take thy flight.

01:19:55.478 --> 01:19:57.462
OUT OF CHARACTER: Take thy flight.

01:19:57.462 --> 01:19:58.550
LAUGHTER

01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:00.482
Now die!

01:20:00.482 --> 01:20:02.506
LAUGHTER

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:03.550
Die!

01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:05.554
THESEUS LAUGHS HEARTILY
Die!

01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:09.470
Die!

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:11.506
Dieeee!

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:13.502
Die!

01:20:13.502 --> 01:20:15.558

Bravo!

No die, but an ace for him!

01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:47.510
Oh, here she comes,
and her passion ends the play.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:50.498
She hath spied him already,
with those sweet eyes.

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.466
Asleep, my love?

01:20:57.502 --> 01:20:59.514
What, dead, my dove?

01:21:01.534 --> 01:21:04.466
O, Pyramus, arise.

01:21:04.466 --> 01:21:06.518
Speak, speak.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.474
Quite dumb?

01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:13.522
Dead, dead?

01:21:15.494 --> 01:21:17.546
A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes.

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:27.478
These lily lips,

01:21:27.478 --> 01:21:28.558
This cherry nose,

01:21:30.478 --> 01:21:35.498
These yellow cowslip cheeks
Are gone, are gone.

THUNDERCLAP

01:21:59.553 --> 01:22:03.473
Lovers, make moan -

01:22:03.473 --> 01:22:06.489
His eyes were green as leeks.

01:22:06.489 --> 01:22:11.469
O, sisters three, Come, come to
me With hands as pale as milk...

01:22:11.469 --> 01:22:15.549
Lay them in gore Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk.

Come, trusty sword,

01:22:42.533 --> 01:22:45.481
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.

01:22:52.549 --> 01:22:54.513
And farewell, friends.

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:58.477
Thus Thisbe ends.

01:23:01.473 --> 01:23:03.521
