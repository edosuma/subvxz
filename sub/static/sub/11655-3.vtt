20:15.924 --> 20:18.093
You're just so brave,

20:18.176 --> 20:20.679
and so strong,

20:20.762 --> 20:23.849
you make a girl feel all a-flutter.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.517
Don't you see, Zeke?

20:25.642 --> 20:28.687
It's just like Kansas City all over again.

20:28.770 --> 20:32.190
And what with this huge bounty
we're about to collect,

20:32.274 --> 20:36.486
I could end up twice as rich! (LAUGHS)

20:37.028 --> 20:39.156
EZEKIEL: Dagburn it, Josie!

20:39.239 --> 20:42.993
You con sarn, cramalammin', wham-danglin',

20:43.076 --> 20:47.581
ratsnakin', sheep's-wool-over-my-eyes,
trick-up-her-sleeve

20:47.664 --> 20:50.500
woo-hoo, whip-jack woman!

20:54.129 --> 20:56.173
(LAUGHING) Whoa!

20:56.339 --> 20:57.340
Whoa!

21:05.432 --> 21:07.976
Uh... Zeke?

21:08.185 --> 21:09.436
Sugarplum?

21:09.686 --> 21:12.272
Maybe I was a mite hasty.

21:12.606 --> 21:14.399
Court says 150 feet, woman.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.359
150 feet!
