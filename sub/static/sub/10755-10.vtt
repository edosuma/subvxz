WEBVTT

00:09.426 --> 00:13.856
This is Dr. Frasier Crane. We'll be right back after this.

00:13.856 --> 00:19.414
OK, after this spot we're gonna come back in 15 seconds, you do a station ID and then toss it to the news.

00:19.414 --> 00:20.468
I'll count you down.

00:20.468 --> 00:21.771
That won't be necessary.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.986
I have a built in mental stopwatch.

00:23.986 --> 00:31.433
As a child playing "Hide and Go Seek"
I was the only one who didn't need to say, "One Hippopotamus Two Hippopotamus."

00:31.433 --> 00:35.199
Frasier, I've heard you.  You're always either talking into the news or running short.

00:35.199 --> 00:36.744
I am not!

00:36.744 --> 00:40.356
I'll bet you 20 bucks you blow this one.

00:40.356 --> 00:41.439
All right, you're on.

00:41.439 --> 00:44.431
No, you are.

00:46.580 --> 00:53.243
Hello, we're back.  This is Dr. Frasier Crane tuning in for our second hour on the "Dr. Frasier Crane Show."

00:53.243 --> 00:57.020
In our first hour we covered everything from anorexia to xenophobia.

00:57.020 --> 01:01.873
What will be next?  As always of course that's entirely up to you.

01:01.873 --> 01:07.306
So stick around ?the Doctor is in and he's listening.

01:07.306 --> 01:15.023
Ooh, this is KACL 780 AM...
This is nbc news..

01:15.023 --> 01:17.673
That was very smooth.
Thank you.

01:18.375 --> 01:24.488
Oh, let's see.  "One Andrew Jackson, Two Andrew Jackson...?

01:24.488 --> 01:30.500
Look Frasier, I've been getting a lot of complaints from sponsors saying that their ads are getting buried in huge commercial blocks.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.541
I see.

01:31.541 --> 01:35.013
So instead of having four blocks per hour we're going to have eight...

01:35.013 --> 01:38.817
...only they're only going to be half as long.  I thought it might help you.

01:38.817 --> 01:43.798
And you want to stay on top, don't you, Frasier?

01:43.798 --> 01:45.737
...Frasier?

01:45.737 --> 01:49.351
Of course, very much so, yes!

01:49.351 --> 01:51.059
Good.

01:54.527 --> 01:56.559
Frasier, what was that?

01:56.559 --> 01:57.282
What was what?

01:57.282 --> 02:02.598
Call me crazy, but when you were talking to Kate you had this goofy little teenage look on your face.

02:02.598 --> 02:05.510
If I didn't know better, I'd swear you got a thing for her.

02:05.510 --> 02:06.250
For Kate?

02:06.250 --> 02:07.884
mm-hmm.  Look at you.  You're flushed.

02:07.884 --> 02:10.907
I had Mexican for lunch.

02:10.907 --> 02:14.646
It's not lust ?it's a Chimichanga.

02:14.646 --> 02:18.223
Frasier, I'm sorry but I'm never wrong about these things.

02:18.223 --> 02:20.014
Have you lost your mind?

02:20.014 --> 02:23.767
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.

02:23.767 --> 02:26.446
Roz, you're wrong.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.320
Oh my God.  I'm sitting on a powder-keg here.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.361
You've got a crush on Kate!

02:31.361 --> 02:33.713
Stop it.

02:33.713 --> 02:37.300
Everybody knows you are the biggest gossip in the entire station.  You'll be sworn to secrecy.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.810
I swear I won't tell anyone.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.579
No, it doesn't count until you shake my hand.

02:40.579 --> 02:41.705
Oh, all right.

02:41.705 --> 02:44.248
Roz, Kate and I...

02:44.248 --> 02:52.811
Oh my God!  Kate's "Dirty Girl"!

02:52.811 --> 02:57.555
Kate is the woman you had sex with on the air in this booth and you were calling "Dirty Girl"?

02:57.555 --> 03:01.859
Oh my God!

03:01.859 --> 03:04.432
I just need a minute here...
Alright.

03:04.432 --> 03:08.049
Of course it happened months ago.  Only a couple of times.

03:08.049 --> 03:09.166
Roz: Uh-huh.

03:09.166 --> 03:16.745
Our relationship started out so antagonistic.  Then suddenly it just spilled over into passion.  Intense, romantic, exciting...

03:16.745 --> 03:22.162
...the whole thing's over now, but Roz, you will say nothing, absolutely nothing...

03:22.162 --> 03:24.352
Roz?  Roz?

03:24.352 --> 03:27.634
Boy, I'll never do that again!

03:34.546 --> 03:37.751
I notice you're grating that carrot at a 45-degree angle.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.341
Does that enhance the flavour?

03:39.341 --> 03:44.696
No, no.  Just an old habit.

03:44.696 --> 03:47.103
And why exactly did you choose to grate carrots?

03:47.103 --> 03:51.066
Because we have carrots!

03:52.825 --> 03:58.184
I hope you don't mind all the questions.  It's just now that I'm separated I'm going to have to learn to cook for myself.

03:58.184 --> 04:02.824
Quite alright.  Tell you what.  Why don't you grate while I put the chicken in?

04:09.520 --> 04:17.253
Thousands of little metal teeth able to tear the flesh right off your...

04:18.841 --> 04:26.506
No, no, false alarm.  Normally I bleed like the Russian royal Family, but not today.

04:26.506 --> 04:29.518
That's Interesting.  You put a toothpick in that chicken.

04:29.518 --> 04:30.943
Now, is that to check when it's done?

04:30.943 --> 04:36.909
No, no.  I'm just marking which one is yours.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.269
Dr. Crane, would you mind setting the table?

04:39.269 --> 04:43.392
Oh, certainly.  Just give a yell if there's anything else that you need to have grated.

04:43.392 --> 04:46.400
You've done enough grating for one night!

04:50.548 --> 04:53.074
Writing a letter?

04:53.792 --> 04:56.239
No, I'm writing my memoirs!

04:56.239 --> 04:57.779
I'll take that as a Yes.

04:57.779 --> 04:59.955
My old army buddy.

04:59.955 --> 05:03.111
You know that's the improper use of a hyphen.

05:03.111 --> 05:07.633
Somehow I don't think Maurie Dingman will mind.

05:07.633 --> 05:13.000
Then I'm sure he won't notice that missing comma and that run-on sentence.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.140
Although this is a particularly glaring error.  It's best not to end a sentence with a preposition.

05:25.153 --> 05:29.971
Not to be technical, but "Off" is a preposition too!

05:33.588 --> 05:34.543
Evening all.

05:34.543 --> 05:38.180
Good news.  I have tickets for the symphony tomorrow night.  Are you free?

05:38.180 --> 05:40.349
Well, actually no.  I have a date.

05:40.349 --> 05:41.406
With who?

05:41.406 --> 05:43.661
Some woman I met at my accountant's.

05:43.661 --> 05:45.487
Yeah, when I was in the service ?

05:45.487 --> 05:54.828
first thing I'd do when I hit a new port was go straight to an accountant and find out where the action was.

05:54.828 --> 05:58.490
I must admit I'm having a little trouble working up my enthusiasm about it.

05:58.490 --> 06:02.853
Only the woman's fault.  It's just that I find myself preoccupied with somebody else right now.

06:02.853 --> 06:08.981
Well, frankly, it's gone a bit beyond preoccupation.
I'm having fantasies about her all the time.

06:08.981 --> 06:11.039
Well there's nothing wrong with that.

06:11.039 --> 06:20.815
You know, when I first met your mother she was so upbeat and bouncy I used to fantasize about her
wearing a skimpy little cheerleader's outfit, shaking her pom-poms...

06:20.815 --> 06:22.981
Grow up you two!

06:22.981 --> 06:25.710
I'm just saying it's perfectly natural.

06:25.710 --> 06:32.064
I can't tell you the number of times I was on a stake-out in the cold picturing your mother
in front of a warm fire wearing nothing but a...

06:32.064 --> 06:34.719
Frasier/Niles: DAD!!!

06:34.719 --> 06:37.812
Oh, I'm sorry.  One day your mother and I went on a church picnic

06:37.812 --> 06:42.529
and the two of you came floating down the river in little wicker baskets!

06:42.529 --> 06:44.919
Was that so hard?

06:46.722 --> 06:50.647
You know, I'm beginning to wonder if I have real feelings for this woman?

06:50.647 --> 06:52.976
I mean I think about her all the time.

06:52.976 --> 06:57.009
Ooh this sounds interesting.  Who are we talking about?

06:57.009 --> 06:57.793
Kate from the office.

06:57.793 --> 07:02.214
Oh, "Dirty Girl."

07:02.214 --> 07:03.348
She seemed nice.

07:03.348 --> 07:06.960
She is nice.  Intelligent, accomplished.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.472
Well, if you think so much of her why don't you ask her out?

07:09.472 --> 07:11.810
Well, we agreed we wouldn't pursue things.

07:11.810 --> 07:17.072
Frankly, she hasn't given me any indication since that she's even had a second thought about me.

07:17.072 --> 07:22.114
Added to which, if Frasier did pursue her and she rejected him, he could hardly rationalise it by saying

07:22.114 --> 07:32.827
she doesn't know what she's missing.  She would know exactly what she's missing - she just didn't miss it!

07:32.827 --> 07:34.981
Thank you, Niles!

07:34.981 --> 07:38.745
You can't let fear of rejection stop you Dr. Crane.

07:38.745 --> 07:41.612
Well, you know Daphne, it's just not that easy really.

07:41.612 --> 07:44.397
Maybe I'm letting this romantic fantasy run away with me.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.836
Truth is we don't really know each other very well and,

07:46.836 --> 07:51.499
you know what if she did reject me, I'd end up going to work every day feeling like a fool.

07:51.499 --> 07:53.274
Hey, am I getting a whiff of chicken here?

07:53.274 --> 07:58.606
Oh fine Dad!  Frankly I've had enough of you and your adolescent wisecracks.

07:58.606 --> 08:01.001
I am not "chicken."  I am just merely hesitant.

08:01.001 --> 08:05.438
alright! I will ask her out tomorrow.  Fine.  I hope that makes you happy!

08:05.438 --> 08:09.078
I just thought I smelled dinner!

08:12.843 --> 08:15.879
THE CITY WITH BROAD, BARE SHOULDERS

08:15.879 --> 08:18.837
Oh Kate.  Hi.  There you are.  I wanted to talk with you.

08:18.837 --> 08:21.282
I'm just going down to the Billing department.

08:21.282 --> 08:26.342
I'll ride along with you.

08:30.955 --> 08:40.116
You know, it seems every time we speak lately the conversation always leads to ratings, commercials, demographics...

08:40.116 --> 08:45.784
...hirings and firings, promotions, demotions, the odd skirmish over the expense account.

08:45.784 --> 08:50.611
It just seems all so dry and impersonal.

08:50.611 --> 08:52.095
Did I hit the right button?

08:52.095 --> 08:56.131
Oh, yes!

08:56.131 --> 08:58.586
Yes.  Yeah.  You did.  You did.  You hit the right button.

08:58.586 --> 09:02.125
I'm sorry ?I've got a lot on my mind.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.183
Yeah, so do I.

09:04.183 --> 09:06.915
Kate I wanted to ask you?

09:06.915 --> 09:11.402
Frasier, I'm leaving KACL.  I'm moving to Chicago.

09:11.402 --> 09:12.279
What?

09:12.279 --> 09:15.228
Yeah.  I'm taking over a station there.

09:15.228 --> 09:23.620
In fact I'm going out on the "Redeye" tonight.  I thought, given our history, I should tell you first.

09:23.620 --> 09:27.688
Well, I'm at a loss for words.

09:27.688 --> 09:32.962
Wouldn't you know it ?on the day I'm leaving?

09:34.220 --> 09:38.166
Well congratulations.  This is a big step for you.

09:38.166 --> 09:42.398
Thanks.  Boy, this was not an easy decision believe me.

09:42.398 --> 09:45.899
You never know if you're leaving a place too soon.

09:45.899 --> 09:54.059
All I know is that for the time you've been here I've certainly enjoyed having you.

09:54.059 --> 10:02.148
Having you...
I know.

10:02.148 --> 10:04.752
I guess this is goodbye.

10:04.752 --> 10:08.496
I suppose so.

10:08.496 --> 10:10.557
Goodbye, Kate.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:23.621 --> 10:26.838
My.  Don't you look dashing?

10:26.838 --> 10:28.728
Thank you.

10:28.728 --> 10:32.422
So, tell me about this woman you're going out with.

10:32.422 --> 10:43.307
Well, her name's Donna.  She's an art director.  Or a park director ?I forget.

10:43.307 --> 10:47.739
Look, I know you're upset about Kate leaving but cheer up.

10:47.739 --> 10:50.540
There's nothing quite as exciting as a first date.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.843
All those questions you ask.

10:52.843 --> 10:56.301
"What's your favourite food?"
"What's your favourite colour?"

10:56.301 --> 11:00.715
"If you were to come back as an animal, what sort of animal would you be?"

11:00.715 --> 11:04.140
If she were to ask you that one, what would you say?

11:04.140 --> 11:08.538
"Cheque please" comes to mind!

11:10.512 --> 11:12.813
Hello?

11:12.813 --> 11:16.861
Niles, no one was mean to you last night.

11:16.861 --> 11:20.222
No, if you want to come over, that's great.  Yeah, we'd love to see you.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.790
OK.  Bye.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.937
Hey Niles.

11:26.932 --> 11:29.034
No traffic?

11:29.034 --> 11:31.895
Dad, you sounded lonely so I rented some movies.

11:31.895 --> 11:34.283
Oh, didn't you know the VCR is broken?

11:34.283 --> 11:35.268
No subtitles this time!

11:35.268 --> 11:38.154
Oh, that's right, I got it fixed.

11:38.154 --> 11:39.199
What'd you bring?

11:39.199 --> 11:42.182
I have "The Way We Were" and a classic, "Casablanca."

11:42.182 --> 11:44.753
Oh, I just love that movie.

11:44.753 --> 11:53.842
Is there any more heartbreaking moment in all of film than when Humphrey Bogart tells Ingrid Bergman
to get on that plane with Victor Laszlow even though Bogey loves her?

11:53.842 --> 11:55.256
What an ending!

11:55.256 --> 12:01.511
Well, there goes my need to finally see that one.

12:02.574 --> 12:06.551
He cares deeply for her and yet he lets her go.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.024
Wonder why Bogey did that?

12:08.024 --> 12:10.487
Why don't we put the movie in and find out?

12:10.487 --> 12:13.350
Because Laszlow needed her by his side to fight the Nazis.

12:13.350 --> 12:15.620
Forget the Nazis.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.968
No man in his right mind would give up Ingrid Bergman.

12:17.968 --> 12:23.734
Oh sure!  Sacrifice the entire free world for a little Swedish meatball?

12:23.734 --> 12:28.691
Look, I don't like Nazis any more than the next guy but what's Ingrid going to do with Laszlow?

12:28.691 --> 12:29.990
You're missing the point.

12:29.990 --> 12:37.768
What makes the movie so romantic is seeing Bogey go from a cynical playboy to a noble self-sacrificing patriot.

12:37.768 --> 12:42.175
Oh why don't you just put on some trenchcoats and act it out?

12:42.175 --> 12:45.207
I'm telling you, if you're in his shoes you've only got one choice.

12:45.207 --> 12:48.166
I'll say you do.  You get the hell down to the airport and tell her to get off the plane.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.445
She's going to Lisbon to fight the Nazis!

12:50.445 --> 12:54.801
No, she's not.  She's going to Chicago to turn a Country & Western station into an all-talk format.

12:54.801 --> 12:56.261
Where are you going?

12:56.261 --> 12:57.972
To stop Kate from getting on that plane!

12:57.972 --> 13:00.289
Well your date's gonna be here in a minute.  What are we supposed to tell her?

13:00.289 --> 13:03.447
Oh, I don't know.  Tell her I'm visiting a sick friend or something.

13:03.447 --> 13:05.212
Better yet ?just tell her the truth.

13:05.212 --> 13:07.641
Sometimes two people just aren't meant to be together.

13:07.641 --> 13:11.788
Ooh ?it's just like Redford and Streisand at the end of "The Way We Were."

13:11.788 --> 13:16.358
And that's another one down.

13:26.420 --> 13:27.463
Frasier!

13:27.463 --> 13:29.478
Don't say anything.  Just listen.

13:29.478 --> 13:34.147
Kate, this afternoon I wanted to say something to you but when I found out you were leaving I held back.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.065
Well, I'm not holding back any more.

13:37.065 --> 13:39.310
I can't stop thinking about you.

13:39.310 --> 13:44.222
Not just about the times we made love but about the possibility that we might have a future together.

13:44.222 --> 13:49.519
Now if there's any part of you that wonders the same thing about me,
we owe it to ourselves to see it through.

13:49.519 --> 13:53.258
You see, if you get on that plane tonight you'll regret it.

13:53.258 --> 13:57.117
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon

13:57.117 --> 13:59.956
and for the rest of our lives.

13:59.956 --> 14:04.557
Anyway I think I made my point.

14:04.557 --> 14:06.869
What do you think?

14:06.869 --> 14:09.689
Kate!

14:09.689 --> 14:14.605
More importantly, what do you think?

14:20.169 --> 14:24.150
Aw, for God's sake, you've been bawling the whole movie.

14:24.150 --> 14:28.332
I have not ?my eyes just itch!

14:29.083 --> 14:33.777
Well, it turns out Bogey was right to let her go.

14:33.777 --> 14:35.525
Frasier, what are you doing here?

14:35.525 --> 14:38.646
Look, Donna stayed to watch "Casablanca?with us.

14:38.646 --> 14:39.681
Donna, hi.

14:39.681 --> 14:41.627
Hello, Frasier.  How's your friend?

14:41.627 --> 14:43.541
In the hospital?

14:43.541 --> 14:47.843
Oh, he's doing much better actually.  They're thinking of sending him home tomorrow.

14:47.843 --> 14:51.227
After a heart transplant?

14:51.227 --> 14:55.708
Well, he's with an HMO!

14:55.708 --> 14:58.954
So... er... what do you say we have that dinner?

14:58.954 --> 15:03.554
Great, I'll just grab my coat.

15:04.623 --> 15:06.179
Kate!

15:06.179 --> 15:10.339
OK; now you listen to me.  I was so touched by what you just said at my apartment.

15:10.339 --> 15:13.834
You said everything that I've wanted to say to you for the last two months.

15:13.834 --> 15:16.577
Tony's just a guy that I went out with a couple of times.

15:16.577 --> 15:20.612
He just came over to say goodbye to me before I went to the airport.

15:20.612 --> 15:23.405
When you saw him you just looked so hurt...

15:23.405 --> 15:27.924
You had a date with her tonight too?

15:27.924 --> 15:30.155
...but apparently you rebounded!

15:30.155 --> 15:34.764
I'm sorry.  I thought you were sincere. Hold the elevator!

15:34.764 --> 15:37.146
Kate!  I was, Kate!  This woman means nothing to me.

15:37.146 --> 15:38.948
Thanks a lot!

15:38.948 --> 15:41.132
Oh, I'm sorry, Donna.  I'm truly sorry.

15:41.132 --> 15:44.009
It was very inconsiderate, but that woman means a great deal to me.

15:44.009 --> 15:47.011
I'm sure you'll hate me, but I just gotta do what I gotta do.

15:47.011 --> 15:48.992
I'm really sorry about this.

15:48.992 --> 15:51.188
Why don't you stay and watch the end of the movie.

15:51.188 --> 15:57.033
Thank you, but I've spent quite enough time in this house tonight.

16:01.865 --> 16:06.747
... this is lucky.  We can ride down together.

16:08.871 --> 16:10.957
IT'S HARD TO SAY GOODBYE IF YOU WON'T LEAVE

16:10.957 --> 16:12.686
Kate!

16:12.686 --> 16:13.900
Frasier!

16:13.900 --> 16:17.497
Oh my God.  I know you're upset.

16:17.497 --> 16:19.771
I don't even care about that woman.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.289
She's just a blind date I didn't even want to go on.
I wanted to be with you tonight.

16:22.289 --> 16:26.926
I know.  I overreacted.  I've been standing here for a half an hour hoping you'd come.

16:26.926 --> 16:28.194
I never thought you'd come.

16:28.194 --> 16:30.166
I can't believe I waited so long when all I had to do was say something.

16:30.166 --> 16:34.599
Listen, it's not your fault.  I could have said something.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.173
Well it doesn't matter.  We're together now.

16:36.173 --> 16:38.142
Your boarding pass, please?

16:38.142 --> 16:40.591
Go ahead.  Go ahead.

16:40.591 --> 16:42.172
Couldn't you just stay one more night?

16:42.172 --> 16:43.862
Just call them.  Tell them you'll come in tomorrow.

16:43.862 --> 16:46.294
I can't.  I can't.  I have a board meeting in the morning.

16:46.294 --> 16:49.089
Oh damn.  All right I'll call you.  Where are you staying?

16:49.089 --> 16:53.708
I'm staying at The Drake.  But, you know what?  I'll call you.  I'll call you the minute I get in.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.671
Ma'am, we're closing the doors.

16:55.671 --> 16:58.447
Goodbye

16:58.447 --> 16:59.566
I'll miss you.

16:59.566 --> 17:01.611
I'll miss you.

17:04.849 --> 17:09.526
Ladies and Gentlemen.  I just spoke with our captain and we're having a little technical snag.

17:09.526 --> 17:14.555
So Flight 487 to Chicago will be delayed indefinitely.

17:14.555 --> 17:18.574
I missed you!
I missed you too!

17:18.574 --> 17:25.387
The minute that door closed I started praying for something bad to happen to your plane.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.905
It's just like fate ?like somebody's willing us to get together.

17:29.905 --> 17:31.689
I felt that way since the moment I met you.

17:31.689 --> 17:34.801
Me too.

17:34.801 --> 17:36.203
Why don't you come with me tonight?

17:36.203 --> 17:38.995
I gotta work.  I could come out next weekend.

17:38.995 --> 17:43.899
Oh, yeah.  Oh, great.
You know what, you can meet my twin sister.  She lives in Chicago.

17:43.899 --> 17:45.434
You've got a twin?
Yes.

17:45.434 --> 17:48.020
Wow.

17:48.020 --> 17:51.858
You know there's so much we don't know about each other.

17:51.858 --> 17:54.909
Well, ask me.  Ask me anything.

17:54.909 --> 17:58.825
Er... oh, I know.  What's your favourite colour?

17:58.825 --> 18:00.854
Blue.  What's yours?

18:00.854 --> 18:05.261
Arctic silver.  It's available on all the big BMW's.

18:05.261 --> 18:06.434
Where's your favorite city?

18:06.434 --> 18:08.052
Paris!  Museum?

18:08.052 --> 18:10.171
The Prada!  Musical?

18:10.171 --> 18:11.535
Candide!  Yours?

18:11.535 --> 18:14.762
Cats!

18:16.871 --> 18:18.225
Really?

18:18.225 --> 18:22.274
Well I love cats.  I have a cat.  Would you like to meet Louie?

18:22.274 --> 18:26.565
No, no.  Allergies.  Allergies.

18:26.565 --> 18:29.004
Not really much of a pet person.

18:29.004 --> 18:31.289
Oh, really?  Oh, no.

18:31.289 --> 18:33.683
All right, we'll work around that.

18:33.683 --> 18:37.186
You Know, what we can do when you come out?  We can go jogging around the lake.

18:37.186 --> 18:42.224
Oh Frasier, the lake is so beautiful.  Do you ever jog?

18:42.224 --> 18:44.998
Once.

18:44.998 --> 18:50.594
In a dark parking lot.  When a truck backfired.

18:50.594 --> 18:52.268
Oh, all right.  We can do something that you like.

18:52.268 --> 18:53.918
What do you like?  What do you like?

18:53.918 --> 18:56.516
Well, we could go antiquing.

18:56.516 --> 19:03.893
You know what?  I'm not one of those people for whom "antique" is a verb.

19:03.893 --> 19:11.466
Ah!  Well, this is all good.  The contrasts between us will make our relationship more vibrant.

19:11.466 --> 19:13.940
Vive la difference!

19:18.227 --> 19:22.095
Louie's getting to you, isn't he?
No, no.  It's all right.

19:22.095 --> 19:27.607
Well, you know, if this is really gonna be a problem there's a shot.

19:27.607 --> 19:36.186
Yes ?and I understand they're completely humane!

19:36.186 --> 19:41.600
Oh, you meant an allergy shot, didn't you?

19:47.165 --> 19:57.720
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Frasier.  I'm just afraid that if I move Louie any further away they're gonna think he's a bomb!

19:57.720 --> 20:00.507
It's all right.  It's all right.

20:00.507 --> 20:04.214
So... er... you were saying that you love animals?

20:04.214 --> 20:08.743
Oh yeah.  I think that's one of the main things that motivates me to work so hard.

20:08.743 --> 20:13.515
I've always had this dream to get a ranch in Montana ?you know?

20:13.515 --> 20:17.511
To ski in the morning and ride horses in the afternoon?

20:17.511 --> 20:20.761
I just always wanted to raise horses.

20:20.761 --> 20:25.471
Wow, life on a ranch raising horses.

20:25.471 --> 20:31.180
I always pictured myself in a penthouse raising children.

20:31.180 --> 20:34.535
You still want more children then?

20:34.535 --> 20:37.212
Yes.  You like kids?

20:37.212 --> 20:39.380
Oh yeah.  I love kids.

20:39.380 --> 20:46.897
I don't see myself mothering one, though.

20:50.418 --> 20:54.040
You know, just to be on the safe side let me just check to see if there's another flight?

20:54.040 --> 20:56.593
Yeah, it couldn't hurt.

20:56.593 --> 21:00.263
Excuse me ?is there another flight to Chicago tonight?

21:00.263 --> 21:01.336
Not until morning.

21:01.336 --> 21:05.453
How about on another airline?

21:07.063 --> 21:10.718
American has one connecting through Atlanta leaving in 10 minutes.

21:10.718 --> 21:12.084
Atlanta's good.  That's a hub.

21:12.084 --> 21:14.535
Yeah, but they're way on the other side of the airport!

21:14.535 --> 21:15.797
Oh damn.  I'll never get there.

21:15.797 --> 21:18.395
Look Kate ?fate to the rescue once again.

21:18.395 --> 21:21.177
Sir ?this woman has to get across the terminal post-haste.

21:21.177 --> 21:24.454
Hey pal, this'll go a lot faster with just one person.

21:24.454 --> 21:28.643
Good point.

21:28.643 --> 21:30.680
Bye.

21:34.229 --> 21:36.249
Pity, though!

21:36.249 --> 21:39.922
Isn't it?

21:59.574 --> 22:06.273
Well, Louie.  This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
