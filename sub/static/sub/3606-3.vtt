He actually posed for that.
I guess he likes me.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.412
You're Jimmy Olsen.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.014
-He knows.
-He knows?

00:49.016 --> 00:51.550

It's you.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.124
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

01:32.126 --> 01:35.594
I meant to say, who are you?

01:35.596 --> 01:37.963

I'm Supergirl.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.433
You have questions.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.169
I'm ready to answer them.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.437
Huh.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.539
Do you mind if I record this?

01:49.777 --> 01:51.477
I suppose not.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.711
Okay.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.680
Supergirl.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.349
Let's start with the generals.
Where are you from?

01:57.351 --> 01:59.518
I traveled to Earth
from my home planet of...

01:59.520 --> 02:02.020
-Krypton?
-KARA: Yes.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.822
When it was destroyed.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.658
My parents sent me here
where they thought
I'd be safe.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.928
(SIGHS) I feel like I've
heard this story before.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.463
This is my story.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.636
So, I can assume

02:17.638 --> 02:21.140
that all of your powers
are the same
as the Man of Steel's?

02:21.142 --> 02:23.075
The flying,
the super strength,

02:23.077 --> 02:24.510
the freezy breath thing?

02:24.512 --> 02:26.778
I'm still working
on that last one.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.748
Oh, so you're not
up to his level yet?

02:32.153 --> 02:33.519
I wouldn't say that.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.721
So, why are we just hearing
from you now?

02:42.196 --> 02:43.662
I'm not sure
I understand the question.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.899
(SIGHS) Well, if you've been
on Earth for years,

02:46.901 --> 02:49.201
why wait this long
to start giving back?

02:49.203 --> 02:51.803
Where were you
during the earthquake
two years ago?

02:51.805 --> 02:55.174
Or the wildfires
last September
that killed eight people?

02:55.176 --> 02:57.543
This is not a job
I take lightly.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.112
I had to be ready.

03:00.114 --> 03:02.314
Any plans to start a family?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.716
Nobody ever asks my cousin
these questions.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.289
Superman is your cousin?

03:10.291 --> 03:12.157
This interview is over.

03:12.159 --> 03:16.128
Well, what do you do all day
when you're not
flying around town?

03:16.130 --> 03:18.330
Do you have a day job?

03:25.573 --> 03:26.638
Mmm.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.807
Mmm. Thank you.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.943
How can you eat sticky buns
for breakfast every day

03:30.945 --> 03:32.277

03:32.279 --> 03:33.912

-Hi.
-Hey.

03:38.152 --> 03:39.985
Are you okay?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.486
I called you like
a bunch of times last night.
Where were you?

03:41.488 --> 03:42.754
I think I fell asleep
last night.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.390

a pretty long day.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.960
-Morning! Hey.
-Hey.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.095
Uh, what are you doing here?

03:50.097 --> 03:53.265
Oh, this is the only place
that makes this really hard
to find drink I like, tea.

um, James Olsen?

04:04.612 --> 04:06.678
-My friend from work.
-Yeah.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.181
How's the covert
alien hunting business?

04:09.183 --> 04:11.516
Not as covert
as we would prefer.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.785
I didn't tell him.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.321
Look, it's okay.
I can be trusted
with a big secret.

04:16.323 --> 04:20.659
Well. I hope you'll extend
the same courtesy
to my sister.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.793
Always.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.198
-Meet up back at the office?
-Yes.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.933
-Great seeing you, Alex.
-Hmm.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.274
-What?
-You like Jimmy Olsen.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.541
Stop it.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.611
Um, first of all,
he prefers James.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.846
-ALEX: Oh.
-Mmm-hmm.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.181
-Okay.
-Second, we're just friends.

-Just friends.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.318

04:46.320 --> 04:48.387

like he was one of
your sticky buns.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.622
And seriously,

04:50.624 --> 04:53.525
you have got to stop telling
people who you really are.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.361

05:45.479 --> 05:47.779

I scooped them.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.084
Yes, I... I heard.

05:52.086 --> 05:55.187
You told everyone that
Supergirl and Superman
are cousins.

05:55.189 --> 06:01.326
Do you think
maybe she might've kind of
wanted that on the down low?

that improves brain energy.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.172
I will need a cup of it
every hour.

06:14.174 --> 06:18.377
Crappy coffee has toxins in it
that will rob me of my
creativity and my vigor.

I'm going to need both...

11:54.414 --> 11:56.548

11:56.550 --> 11:59.451
Reactron, whoever he is,
is human.

11:59.453 --> 12:02.721

this case falls outside
the DEO's jurisdiction.

and shoots nuclear fireballs!

exposing this organization

shows up at National City.

Uh, no.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.839
You don't you hear
that loud, high pitched,
incessant humming

12:54.841 --> 12:56.207
coming from the vents

12:56.209 --> 12:57.942
that is making it impossible
for me to think straight,

12:57.944 --> 13:01.946
let alone string together
one coherent sentence?

13:01.948 --> 13:05.416
I have pretty good ears,
and I don't hear anything.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.019
Well, get maintenance
to look into it

13:08.021 --> 13:09.721
because it's driving me crazy.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.656
Sure thing,
I'll get them right on it.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.592
I just need you
to approve the appetizers
for tomorrow.

13:14.594 --> 13:18.763

of the fact

13:18.765 --> 13:20.765

of being a CEO

13:20.767 --> 13:23.101
I have never thrown a phone
at an assistant.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.604
I would very much like
to keep that record intact.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.972

working on that article, huh?

13:34.681 --> 13:36.648
Yeah. You could say that.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.449

when she's writing?

to be within yelling distance.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.909

Not for that job.
For our other job.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.312
This used to be
Ed Flaherty's office
from Actuaries

14:07.314 --> 14:10.248
but after he died of a heart
attack behind his desk,
nobody wants it.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.517
Which makes it
perfect for our needs.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.119
Now, we can't just
crowd around your desk

14:15.121 --> 14:16.754
every time we want to talk
Supergirl stuff.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.490
So, I loaded this office up
with some, uh,

14:19.492 --> 14:21.359

top-of-the-line tech.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.530

you did all this for me.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.166

14:28.168 --> 14:31.903

remains a mystery. Right?

We know Superman has
fought him multiple times
over the years.

-I know. I was there.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.579

Anyway, he shoots
these highly concentrated...

14:43.817 --> 14:46.217
-Bursts of nuclear energy.
-From his gauntlets.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.020
-Uh, his chest plate provides
an increase in strength...

-Yeah.

that will sweep the city

14:52.425 --> 14:54.325

changes in radiation.

use this to find him.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.632
And then what?

15:00.634 --> 15:05.103
And then Kara goes
all Supergirl on him.

15:05.105 --> 15:08.606
Kara, you might consider
calling your cousin
on this one.

occurred to you

Kara, we may have a way
for you to stop Krull.

36:29.955 --> 36:32.189
Krull's chest unit is powered
by a Demon Core,

36:32.191 --> 36:33.957
<i> a subcritical</i>
<i> mass of plutonium.</i>

36:33.959 --> 36:35.458
ALEX: (OVER RADIO)
<i> If you can remove</i>
<i> it from his suit,</i>

36:35.460 --> 36:37.827
it should shut
down his weaponry.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.530
But the core will melt down
the very moment it's freed
from its containment matrix.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.366
There has to be
some way to stop him
without nuking the city.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.603
You need to encase
the core in lead
before you rip it free.

36:47.272 --> 36:48.338
Lead.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.264
You could have been killed.

38:21.266 --> 38:24.534
No. I knew you'd save the day.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.702
(CHUCKLES)

38:31.243 --> 38:33.076
Thank you for your help.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.312
Both of you.

38:35.314 --> 38:38.181
Something tells me
this isn't the last non-alien
you'll be taking on.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.150
And since the threat
of federal prison

38:40.152 --> 38:42.619
doesn't stop your sister
disobeying my orders,

38:42.621 --> 38:46.056
I guess in the future
we'll just have to help
Supergirl again.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.462
Told you he'd come
around on me.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.698
So, what does
the Girl of Steel
do to celebrate

38:54.700 --> 38:56.299
after saving the day?

38:56.301 --> 38:59.736
Um... How about
the Danvers sisters
take in a movie tonight?

38:59.738 --> 39:03.873
Or how about you go find
a certain ex-photojournalist

39:03.875 --> 39:05.675
with a penchant
for tight shirts

39:05.677 --> 39:10.046
who makes you smile
more than anyone else
I've ever seen do?

39:12.050 --> 39:13.450
Yeah, that.

(GIGGLING)

39:19.358 --> 39:21.825
Hey, James,
do you have a minute?
I wanted to ask...

39:21.827 --> 39:23.093
I'm sorry.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.562
I didn't know you weren't...

39:25.564 --> 39:27.430
Kara, this is Lucy Lane.

39:27.432 --> 39:29.566
Hey, it's nice
to meet you, Kara.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.301
Nice to meet you.

39:31.303 --> 39:34.371
Lane. Uh, any relation?

39:34.373 --> 39:36.339
Yes. Lois is my big sister.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.975
Oh, I have one of those too.

39:43.782 --> 39:46.249
Uh, I'll catch up
with you later, Kara.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.618
Sorry. Bye.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.789
I can't do this right now.

I came a long way to see you.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.767
And why did you?

40:03.769 --> 40:06.970
I didn't like the way
we ended things.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.471
Could we just get dinner?

40:08.473 --> 40:09.606
And talk?

40:10.842 --> 40:12.208
Yeah, sure.

40:12.577 --> 40:13.643
Dinner.

40:25.424 --> 40:28.491
-Hey, you okay?
-Fine, yeah, fine.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.395
Hey, you want to go down
to our, uh,

40:32.397 --> 40:35.265
(WHISPERING)
our secret office,
do some super sleuthing?

40:35.267 --> 40:37.233
Actually,
I have a lot of work to do.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.701
Maybe later?

41:22.714 --> 41:24.347
Thanks, Clark.

41:25.317 --> 41:26.816
It means a lot to me.

No James Olsen tonight, huh?

41:44.102 --> 41:46.102
No, not tonight.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.737
Pass me that last pot sticker.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.472
Uh, no.

41:50.342 --> 41:52.041
That one is mine.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.110
You had four.

41:54.112 --> 41:57.447
If that pot sticker is not in
my mouth in two seconds,
I will melt your face.

42:01.386 --> 42:02.752
I hope you get fat.

Not on this planet.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.527
So, guess what
I picked up on the way.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.663
Did you actually
read the article?

42:13.665 --> 42:16.299
Because she says horrible
things about me.

42:16.301 --> 42:19.269
Very well-crafted
horrible things.

42:20.672 --> 42:23.473
Deep beneath that
seething disdain...

42:24.976 --> 42:26.409
...she respects you.

-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

couldn't even do.
