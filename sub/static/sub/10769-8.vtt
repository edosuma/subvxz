WEBVTT

00:02.735 --> 00:06.570
So this is what you wanna do, huh?
You think you want some of me, huh?

00:06.740 --> 00:08.503
Let's go.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.408
Blackjack.

00:12.212 --> 00:13.873
Man, that's three in a row.

00:14.047 --> 00:16.743
I should be taking you to Vegas with me
instead of Carlton.

00:16.916 --> 00:19.714
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Pay the man.

00:27.794 --> 00:28.886
You know what that is?

00:29.062 --> 00:30.859
Irritating.

00:31.331 --> 00:35.768
It's energy generated by the most awesome
source of natural power in the world.

00:35.935 --> 00:38.870
What,
the static from Uncle Phil's corduroys?

00:39.305 --> 00:40.499
The Hoover Dam.

00:40.673 --> 00:45.133
Here, I got you this book so when we get
to Vegas, you'll be Hoover savvy.

00:45.612 --> 00:48.547
I'm getting goose bumps.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.074
You too?

00:51.951 --> 00:53.612
Okay, guys. Here you go.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.483
Here are your airplane tickets
and your hotel confirmation.

00:56.656 --> 00:59.420
Thanks. This is gonna be
the greatest birthday present ever.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.856
It's a shame
you have to go to Sacramento.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.086
Oh, I know. I know.

01:03.263 --> 01:07.222
But, son, this isn't just a birthday,
this is your 21st birthday.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.268
And this isn't just a trip,
it's a rite of passage.

01:11.438 --> 01:14.874
Cheyenne Indians used to take
a young brave and leave him in the desert...

01:15.041 --> 01:17.908
...and he'd have to fend for himself
with nothing but a knife.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.911
But when he left that desert,
he was a man.

01:22.816 --> 01:26.684
There's certainly some places in this desert
where a brother can become a man.

01:28.455 --> 01:31.185
I don't know where none of them at,
you know, you know, but...

01:31.357 --> 01:33.291
I'm gonna go ahead and get my knife.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.278 --> 02:59.677
Aww.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.314
Okay, ladies, I'm leaving.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.384
They don't hear you, sir.
They've begun their women's weekend.

03:07.554 --> 03:12.423
Right now, they're in phase one.
Chick flicks and mint Milanos.

03:14.961 --> 03:17.327
I said, I'm leaving.

03:24.437 --> 03:28.134
Well, it's not like
you're going off to war, sir.

03:30.777 --> 03:35.840
I just know that one day Thelma and Louise
will make it to the other side of the canyon.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.258
Somebody pinch me.

03:51.431 --> 03:55.561
I'm in the same city with Tom Jones,
Wayne Newton, and Engelbert Humperdinck.

03:56.636 --> 04:01.596
So many shows, so little time. Ugh.

04:08.248 --> 04:14.209
I can't believe I'm in the same city
as Girls, Girls, Girls. Oh!

04:14.387 --> 04:17.048
So many shows, so little time.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.192
Whoo-hoo!

04:21.361 --> 04:23.420
Bells ringing, money flowing.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.156
We are certainly not in Kansas anymore.

04:28.534 --> 04:34.063
Oh, Auntie Em, Dorothy got a miniskirt on.

04:34.707 --> 04:39.041
We've entered the world of temptation.
A word to the wise, beware.

04:39.212 --> 04:42.841
All right, here's the plan.
First, we split up...

04:43.016 --> 04:45.041
- And?
- That's it. We just split up.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.242
All right, I get it.

04:46.419 --> 04:49.650
We'll gamble for about an hour or so,
but then we have to hit the hay.

04:49.822 --> 04:52.052
We don't wanna miss sunrise
at Hoover Dam.

04:52.225 --> 04:55.251
They say it starts out mauve.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.928
You're an odd little man, aren't you?

04:59.432 --> 05:00.456
Yeah.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.541
Change for a dollar, please.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.439
There's a $5 minimum, sir.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.981
Outrageous. We're out of here, Will.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.346
Whoa, wait a minute, Carlton.
Relax, man.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.147
Can I get change for 100, please?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.314
A hundred? Are you insane?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.254
Change 100.

05:27.427 --> 05:30.396
See, she can't believe it either.

05:38.404 --> 05:41.168
Okay. "You're at a friend's house
for Christmas dinner...

05:41.341 --> 05:45.300
...and you find a dead cockroach
in your salad. What do you do?"

05:45.878 --> 05:49.575
I eat around it, because cockroaches
go straight to my thighs.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.417
- I'd switch plates with Carlton.
Ha-ha.

05:54.587 --> 05:58.250
Okay, Hilary, it's your turn.
I'll ask you a question.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.858
"Would it bother you much
if upon your death...

06:01.027 --> 06:03.996
...your body was simply
thrown into the woods and abandoned?"

06:04.163 --> 06:05.687
Does it say what I'm wearing?

06:09.168 --> 06:10.760
Geoffrey, you scared us.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.297
Ahem. I'm sorry, madam.

06:12.472 --> 06:15.999
It's just that I've never seen you three
without your makeup before.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.833
Okay, Geoffrey, fine. A question for you.

06:19.011 --> 06:22.208
"If you could use a voodoo doll
to hurt anyone you chose, would you?"

06:22.382 --> 06:25.647
Miss Ashley,
if it hasn't worked by now...

06:25.818 --> 06:27.615
- Aah!
- Perhaps it's kicking in.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.118
No, I saw a mouse.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.620
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

06:31.791 --> 06:32.883
What'd it look like?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.619
Like Mickey,
only without the big white gloves.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.990
- Oh, my God. I see it!
- Geoffrey, get it!

06:38.164 --> 06:39.825
- Which way did it go?
That way!

06:39.999 --> 06:41.694
Thank you.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.125
No.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.065
All right. First, I'll take odds on my point.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.503
Give me a 12-dollar six and eight,
10-dollar nine.

06:48.674 --> 06:52.269
Give me five on the come, five in the field.
Keep my hard ways working for me.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.073
Oh, yeah. Split me up $10.
Boxcars and yo.

06:56.082 --> 06:59.540
And here's a buck. Spread it around.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.718
Give me them. Give me them.
Give me them.

07:03.523 --> 07:04.649
Nine. Winner.

07:04.824 --> 07:08.692
Whoo! Give me the loot. Give me the loot.
I'm a bad, bad man.

07:11.197 --> 07:15.497
All right. All right. Show me 20.
Show me 20. Show me 20.

07:15.668 --> 07:16.794
Here we go. Here we go.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.838
Oh, come on, baby. Come on, baby.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.278
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

07:30.416 --> 07:33.146
All right, come on. It's your turn.
Roll them, C.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.685
All right, fine.

07:36.055 --> 07:37.818
Come to papa.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.833
Come on,
aren't you gonna bet something?

07:49.001 --> 07:52.061
Yes, I put $5 on red and 5 on black.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.672
That'll cancel your bet out.
You can't win like that.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.468
Maybe so, but I can't lose either.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.134
- Not unless it comes up...
Double zero, green.

08:05.518 --> 08:10.820
One penny, two penny, three...

08:10.990 --> 08:14.289
No, better not take the chance.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.127
Yes, I've got it.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.201
Hey. Hey, Carlton.
Oh, man, you are never gonna believe this.

08:24.370 --> 08:27.066
Let me tell you,
I'm at this crap table, right? It's crazy.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.176
I'm just barking numbers like, boom, seven,
boom, 11. The crowd is going crazy.

08:31.344 --> 08:35.041
The girls are like, "Willy Smith, is that you?"
I'm like, "Who you think it is?"

08:35.214 --> 08:36.977
They're going crazy. They all love me.

08:37.149 --> 08:40.208
I'm throwing back doors, yos,
Little Joes, all that kind of stuff.

08:40.385 --> 08:44.322
I'm just straight jacking the casino for their
loot. Man, I was like a crap Mandingo.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.587
- So, what happened?
- Hey, can you spot a brother 20?

08:53.933 --> 08:57.266
I cannot believe you froze me up
right in the middle of my comeback.

08:57.937 --> 09:01.600
Hi, my name is Will Smith,
and I'm a gambleholic.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.472
Carlton, come on, man.
Didn't you feel the juice?

09:04.644 --> 09:07.078
Will, that's the devil's juice.

09:07.246 --> 09:11.046
I'm about to have me
some of the devil's eggs and bacon too. Ha!

09:11.217 --> 09:13.447
Very funny, Will. Now hand it over.

09:13.619 --> 09:16.019
- What?
- You were right there when Dad said it.

09:16.188 --> 09:19.089
"Keep an eye on Will.
Make sure he doesn't get out of control.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.227
Make sure he doesn't drink
the devil's juice."

09:22.962 --> 09:24.429
Man, he ain't say none of that.

09:24.964 --> 09:29.196
You are so far gone.
Now hand over all your money.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.433
Is that gonna shut you up?

09:31.604 --> 09:33.367
Yes.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.644
Now let's get some shuteye.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.007
Look, man, I ain't tired.

09:42.181 --> 09:45.150
Do you want to miss Hoover Dam?

09:46.786 --> 09:49.311
Hoover Dam.

09:57.964 --> 10:01.627
I don't wanna see no damn Hoover Dam.

10:03.402 --> 10:06.530
It's more beautiful than I thought.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.664
It is mauve.

10:13.846 --> 10:16.041
Hey, Carlton. Carlton.

10:16.215 --> 10:20.481
Come on, eight, eight, eight.
I need an eight. I want an eight. Eight.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.780
Eight. Eight. Give me an eight.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.918
Carlton, what the hell are you doing?

10:25.091 --> 10:28.356
What am I doing? I'm gambling.
What do you think? Come on, eight.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.927
Carlton, you can't put all your money
on one number.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.587
And the winner is eight.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.734
Yes! Eight. I won.

10:35.901 --> 10:39.564
I love you, man. You know
I always loved you, man. Ha-ha-ha.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.406
Place your bets.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.737
- Hey, hey, so how much are you up?
- We're not up. We're down.

10:45.444 --> 10:46.911
What you mean "we"?

10:47.079 --> 10:49.138
Well, after I maxed out
all my credit cards...

10:49.315 --> 10:51.510
Carlton,
you maxed out all your credit cards?

10:51.684 --> 10:55.211
I had to. I couldn't get full value
for the airline tickets.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.855
You hocked our airline tickets?

10:57.023 --> 11:01.016
Well, what do you expect?
I only got $200 out of your ATM card.

11:01.193 --> 11:04.754
A word to the wise, Will,
never leave your PIN number in your wallet.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.626
You took my wallet?
Carlton, how much is left?

11:07.800 --> 11:12.328
- Whatever's left on the table.
- Wait a minute. Aah!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.336
- And the winner is eight...
- Yes!

11:14.507 --> 11:16.998
...teen.
- No!

11:20.746 --> 11:24.512
No, wait, wait. Wait a minute. It was 18,
we had eight. We should get something.

11:25.818 --> 11:30.312
What a rush. You feel that? What a ride.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.321
Carlton, you lost all our money.

11:33.492 --> 11:36.017
Oh, please.
I'm not ready to come down just yet.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.392
What the hell were you thinking, man?

11:38.564 --> 11:41.397
I was so excited about going
to Hoover Dam, I couldn't sleep.

11:41.567 --> 11:45.162
So I figured I'd come down
and place a little harmless bet and I won.

11:45.337 --> 11:48.864
You know, I tried to walk away
but the crap table just kept calling me.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.272
"Carlton. Carlton."

11:52.445 --> 11:55.710
And then the blackjack table was saying,
"You can do it."

11:55.881 --> 11:58.213
And then the slot machines
just started yelling:

11:58.384 --> 12:02.616
"Hey, you tall handsome guy,
come shake my hand."

12:02.788 --> 12:05.780
These are all my new friends.

12:05.958 --> 12:09.519
My God, they're pumping a lot of oxygen
into this room.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.329
That was the worst night of my life.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.961
Tossing and turning,
thinking about that mouse.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.672
What are you complaining about?
I'm the one who caught it and got rid of it.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.409
Mommy, Ashley's bothering me.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.553
Ashley, stop bothering your sister.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.821
- Big baby.
- She did it again.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.117
We have the whole day to ourselves
without men.

12:40.292 --> 12:44.126
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Go to the mall and scam on guys.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.888
See, Mom, she is so immature.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.458
It's Saturday, the guys are at the gym.

12:51.003 --> 12:54.666
I think the whole point of this
is for us to bond without men.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.001
- Can we talk about men?
- No.

12:57.176 --> 13:00.270
- Not even negatively?
- What you got?

13:00.446 --> 13:03.438
Okay, tell me something.
Now, are all men hard of hearing...

13:03.616 --> 13:07.245
...or is it just that they don't wanna listen
to anything we have to say?

13:07.419 --> 13:10.980
Right. We have to listen until we're blue
in the face about cars, sports...

13:11.157 --> 13:15.491
...money, their precious careers, and then
if we wanna talk about something...

13:15.661 --> 13:18.653
...that's really important to us,
they can't be bothered.

13:20.032 --> 13:23.331
Wait, how about this?
How about when they never listen? Heh.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.133
Wow, Will, the casino's head office.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.905
Can't you just feel the money?

13:35.080 --> 13:38.516
I mean, my God,
look at all the animal heads in here.

13:39.051 --> 13:42.953
Hey, Rocky,
watch me pull a rabbit out of a hat.

13:45.591 --> 13:46.922
- Shut up, Carlton.
- Ow!

13:47.092 --> 13:49.253
Now, come on,
the only way that my plan is gonna work...

13:49.428 --> 13:51.589
...is if you follow my instructions
to the letter.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.825
- Great. What are the instructions?
- "Shut the hell up."

13:59.772 --> 14:02.002
- Hello, gentlemen.
- How you doing? Will Smith.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.735
Pleasure. I understand you gentlemen
would like to discuss a little business.

14:05.911 --> 14:10.314
Heh. A little? Pshh. We got something
that is gonna rock your world.

14:10.883 --> 14:13.875
- Rock away.
- All right.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.654
Well, you know, we were talking...

14:16.822 --> 14:18.483
- Have a seat.
- Oh.

14:22.494 --> 14:25.395
We were just walking around
in your beautiful casino...

14:25.564 --> 14:29.091
...you know, fully caught up in the magic
and the fun and the excitement...

14:29.268 --> 14:32.726
...and we suffered
a minor cash-flow problem.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.332
I feel your pain.

14:36.809 --> 14:41.246
- Listen, "Fred." I can call you Fred, right?
- Sure.

14:41.413 --> 14:46.248
My associate and I,
we wanna make you a very, very rich man.

14:46.418 --> 14:47.817
Too late.

14:49.388 --> 14:54.155
He said, "Too late." He put the ring up.
You know, he said, "Too late."

14:54.326 --> 14:57.591
You know, I like this guy.
No, no, but seriously, you know...

14:57.763 --> 15:00.425
Now, are you familiar with the term
"money making money"?

15:00.599 --> 15:02.760
- Sure.
- Let me paint you a little picture.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.995
Now, we're out and we're hanging around
in your delightful casino.

15:06.171 --> 15:09.868
I mean, we are shooting craps and we're
playing cards and the crowd is excited.

15:10.042 --> 15:13.443
I mean, they are really excited.
And they're saying to themselves:

15:13.612 --> 15:17.480
"Wow, look at these guys. They're losing,
but look how much fun they're having."

15:17.650 --> 15:21.848
And then it hits them.
Losing is more fun than winning.

15:22.388 --> 15:25.482
They're saying to themselves,
"Wow, how can we get in on the fun?"

15:25.658 --> 15:28.650
Before you know it, people start talking,
and they're saying:

15:28.827 --> 15:32.058
"Hey, honey, go ahead,
draw to the inside straight.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.927
You got 20, so what? Hit it."

15:35.100 --> 15:38.661
People at the crap tables, "Come on,
snake eyes. Let's go, snake eyes."

15:38.837 --> 15:43.604
People will come to your casino to lose.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.504
Huh?

15:47.680 --> 15:50.205
Ching-ching. Huh?

15:50.382 --> 15:52.816
You can feel the electricity, can't you?
You can feel it, right?

15:52.985 --> 15:54.543
Oh, yeah. I feel it.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.587
I knew you would. You know,
I mean, there's one hitch though.

15:57.756 --> 16:00.987
I mean, we're out in the casino,
we're working our tail off for you...

16:01.160 --> 16:02.821
...and we lost all our money.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.831
Oh, so you want your money back?

16:07.299 --> 16:11.258
That is why you are you.
You deserve every one of them heads, Fred.

16:12.738 --> 16:16.469
Carlton, you taking notes from this man?
Y'all taking notes from this man?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.610
So then it's settled. Chips are fine.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.669
Uh... Is there anything else?

16:21.847 --> 16:24.509
Well, I don't know.
I wouldn't mind catching a show.

16:24.683 --> 16:28.744
- Just name it.
- Tom Jones.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.282
Who?

16:33.158 --> 16:36.525
You know what? Never mind. Never mind.
So where do we go from here?

16:36.695 --> 16:39.823
Are you gonna give it to us
or should we go out to the cashier?

16:39.999 --> 16:43.127
Basically, where we go from here
is that I'm gonna count to three...

16:43.302 --> 16:48.467
...and if you gentlemen are not out of my
office, I've got space for you on my wall.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.572
I still don't know what happened.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.048
I mean, I went into the desert
just like my father said. I had my knife.

17:00.219 --> 17:03.780
But how is a brave suppose to concentrate
with all these bells and whistles?

17:03.956 --> 17:05.617
Not to mention the keno girls.

17:05.790 --> 17:09.521
How am I gonna call my father and tell him
I'm an utter and absolute failure?

17:09.694 --> 17:12.391
I don't think it's gonna be the shock
that you think it is.

17:12.564 --> 17:15.624
Well, at least I know it's over.
The insanity is done.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.165
I'm Carlton again.

17:17.603 --> 17:21.471
- Carlton, look, a quarter.
- Oh, it's mine. It's mine.

17:23.342 --> 17:24.775
You're pathetic.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.641
You're right.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.713
I've hit rock bottom.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.181
How come you can see the quarter
and I can't?

17:33.585 --> 17:35.917
Because there ain't no quarter, man.

17:36.088 --> 17:38.420
Now get on the phone
and call Uncle Phil.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.957
Will, it's a sign.

17:45.431 --> 17:49.367
You're an imbecile,
but we still have to call Uncle Phil.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.262
- But you don't understand.
- Carlton...

17:52.438 --> 17:56.204
It's a dance contest
and I'm a dancing machine.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.638
Huh? Huh?

18:17.663 --> 18:20.393
Wow, the competition's even stiffer
than I thought.

18:24.570 --> 18:28.301
Please. My mom got better moves than that
the time her girdle slipped in Church.

18:33.011 --> 18:37.675
All right. Okay, thank you. That was rad.

18:38.117 --> 18:43.350
We're gonna welcome our next contestants
all the way from Bel-Air, California.

18:43.522 --> 18:48.459
Please welcome Will the Thrill
and Boogaloo Shrimp.

19:08.046 --> 19:09.741
<i>Tonto
Jump on it</i>

19:09.915 --> 19:12.145
<i>Jump on it

19:16.088 --> 19:17.953

19:18.123 --> 19:20.489

19:45.284 --> 19:47.218
<i>I'm Big Bank
I am the Chief</i>

19:47.386 --> 19:49.320
<i>I got a lot of raps
But I'll be real</i>

19:49.488 --> 19:51.012
<i>I never need a horse
I like to chill</i>

19:55.494 --> 19:57.928
We were up, we were down,
we were all around...

19:58.096 --> 20:01.031
...and suddenly out of nowhere,
they just ripped our hearts out.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.169
Look, see, it doesn't matter
how many bruises and scars you got.

20:04.336 --> 20:09.239
The important thing is you came out
of that desert alive, and a man.

20:10.976 --> 20:15.379
A very odd little man, but a man.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.779
Yeah, I did, didn't I? I just wish
we could've won that dance contest.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.785
I mean,
how dare they give us the booby prize.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.480
Hey look, man,
that booby prize paid our way home.

20:25.657 --> 20:28.182
Trust me, Will, I will never gamble again.

20:28.460 --> 20:32.897
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

20:33.065 --> 20:37.195
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

20:37.369 --> 20:43.171
<i>Happy birthday, dear Carlton</i>

20:43.342 --> 20:50.544
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

20:51.984 --> 20:54.145
Okay, son, make a wish.

20:54.319 --> 20:57.447
Hey, Carlton,
bet you can't blow them all out.

20:58.156 --> 21:00.488
Oh, yeah? Well, I got 20 that says I can.

21:00.659 --> 21:04.095
Hey, Will, you want some action on this?
I can beat you. I'll blow it out.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.663
- You're not in Vegas anymore.
- You wanna bet on this?
