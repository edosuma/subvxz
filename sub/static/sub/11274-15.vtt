Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:07.757 --> 00:08.758
Are you, uh,

00:08.758 --> 00:10.510
are you going to make
a move in our lifetime?

00:10.510 --> 00:12.796
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

00:12.796 --> 00:13.797
Oh, come on, Norm.

00:13.797 --> 00:15.682
Why don't you just give
up? You're finished.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.599
Well, not necessarily.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.101
He could move this piece

00:18.101 --> 00:20.103
over to here.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.106
My God, Woody, that's brilliant.

00:23.106 --> 00:26.109
You're suggesting that after
two futile interpositions,

00:26.109 --> 00:29.396
he attempt to force unobstructed
access to the eighth rank.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.231
Well, no, I'm saying he
should take your horsey

00:31.231 --> 00:33.233
with his little pointy-headed guy.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.237
No, not that one.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.122
Too late! Checkmate!

00:39.122 --> 00:39.956
(cackles)

00:39.956 --> 00:41.207
Good game, Norm.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.042
Okay, next victim.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.543
SAM: Well, what's with this

00:43.543 --> 00:45.412
obsession with chess here, huh?

00:45.412 --> 00:46.796
Oh, it's just a hobby, Sam.

00:46.796 --> 00:47.797
You know, uh, relieve the tension.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.300
Well, I got a better
way to relieve tension.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.168
Her name's Tawny. You want her number?

00:52.168 --> 00:53.970
No, thanks, Sam.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.840
I prefer something with a little
mental stimulation as well.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.341
So read to her first.

01:00.844 --> 01:02.846
No, thanks. I'll stick to chess.

01:02.846 --> 01:04.346
You know, that and fencing

01:04.346 --> 01:06.232
were my two outlets during college.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.650
Oh, boy, fencing.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.403
I haven't had the old epÃ©e out in years.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.738
Boy, that'd make me

01:11.738 --> 01:13.239
pretty tense, too.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.244
(piano plays)

01:18.244 --> 01:21.114
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:21.114 --> 01:24.117
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:24.617 --> 01:27.120
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:27.120 --> 01:30.623
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:30.623 --> 01:34.127
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:36.296 --> 01:38.298
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:38.298 --> 01:43.803
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:43.803 --> 01:48.308
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:48.308 --> 01:50.810
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:50.810 --> 01:53.313
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:53.313 --> 01:58.318
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:58.318 --> 02:00.820
? You want to go where people know ?

02:00.820 --> 02:03.823
? People are all the same ?

02:03.823 --> 02:08.328
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:25.428 --> 02:26.346
Mind if I play, Dr. Crane?

02:26.346 --> 02:28.097
No, not at all, Woody.

02:28.097 --> 02:30.400
I've thrashed everybody else in the bar.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.269
You may as well be allowed your
chance at ignominious defeat.

02:33.269 --> 02:35.738
Well, thank you, Dr. Crane.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.490
(whimpering)

02:38.775 --> 02:40.777
(whimpering continues)

02:40.777 --> 02:43.279
Hi, Sam.

02:43.279 --> 02:45.281
Hi, Lor... are you all right, Loretta?

02:45.281 --> 02:47.283
I'm fine, and you?

02:49.285 --> 02:50.787
Oh, I'm-I'm fine.

02:50.787 --> 02:52.789
That's nice to hear.

02:52.789 --> 02:54.791
Is Carla working tonight?

02:54.791 --> 02:55.792
Yeah.

02:55.792 --> 02:57.177
She's right over there.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.011
Thank you, Sam.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.513
It's been nice talking with you.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.015
(sobs)

03:02.015 --> 03:04.434
Excuse me, Carla,

03:04.434 --> 03:06.886
but I caught Nick cheating on me

03:06.886 --> 03:08.888
and I've decided to leave him.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.859
So you finally found out
my ex-husband is a jerk.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.728
Well, I told you that
before you married the bum.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.063
I've done my part.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.064
(sobs)

03:18.064 --> 03:20.066
Carla...

03:20.066 --> 03:23.953
Don't ignore her in her time of need.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.456
Can't you tell when a woman is dying?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.457
Sure.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.959
When the roots start showing. Like that.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.583
Want a drink?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.418
A diet cola would be wonderful.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.669
Okay.

03:41.504 --> 03:43.389
Look, kid,

03:43.389 --> 03:45.341
I'm sorry this happened to you.

03:45.341 --> 03:48.344
Oh, thank you, Carla, thank you.

03:48.344 --> 03:50.847
I'm moved beyond recognition.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.602
How long did it take you
to mend your broken heart?

03:55.602 --> 03:57.270
I'll let you know when it happens.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.243
Loretta...

04:04.744 --> 04:06.246
...would you like to talk about it?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.747
Not really.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.253
To come home and find
out that a loved one

04:13.253 --> 04:16.255
has been unfaithful is a terrible blow.

04:16.255 --> 04:20.760
The best therapy is to
tell how you feel about it.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.762
I'm against it.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.767
All right, Diane, you've
got your catharsis.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.269
Now leave the girl alone.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.771
Well, at least I'm trying to help.

04:31.771 --> 04:35.275
You're merely trying to figure out

04:35.275 --> 04:37.277
why your king's about to be mated.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.145
Oh, my God.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.649
Woody, you must be an idiot savant.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.651
Yeah, but I cover it

04:45.151 --> 04:47.036
by smiling a lot.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.658
Come on, Loretta.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.326
Don't hold it inside.

04:53.326 --> 04:56.629
Well, Nick, who is my husband,

04:56.629 --> 04:59.132
has been seeing another woman.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.134
I just realized it today

05:01.134 --> 05:03.636
when I found blonde
hairs on Nick's shirt.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.308
Loretta, you're a blonde.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.678
Sure. Take his side.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.480
Would you excuse us, please?

05:19.435 --> 05:21.437
Look, it's closing time.

05:21.437 --> 05:24.440
Loretta needs someone
to confide in right now.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.858
Sam, why don't you go on home,

05:25.858 --> 05:27.860
and we ladies will take care of her.

05:28.861 --> 05:30.863
Wh-What is this "we" bit?

05:30.863 --> 05:34.367
I feel very strongly that
it's our duty as women

05:34.367 --> 05:37.870
to be there for another
woman when she wants to talk.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.373
Just as I feel very strongly
that it's my duty as a man

05:40.373 --> 05:42.375
to be there for a woman when
she doesn't want to talk.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.626
Same kind of thing.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.930
We'll miss that kind of poignancy, Sam.

05:49.799 --> 05:50.600
Now, what do you say?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.101
Will you do it? Oh, all right.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.604
But only because no living
thing should be subjected

05:54.604 --> 05:57.607
to a night alone with you.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.609
That's the spirit.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.060
Let's wrap it up, guys.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.562
Oh, oh, well, all right, Sam.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.564
We can, uh, finish
this up tomorrow, Woody.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.566
Well, who's winning now, Dr. Crane?

06:06.566 --> 06:08.568
Oh, what does it matter who's winning?

06:12.955 --> 06:14.741
We'll just start out
fresh tomorrow, okay?

06:14.741 --> 06:17.210
Night, Sam.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.222
Oh, Carla, I still love him.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.224
Nothing you can do.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.093
We're talking about Nick Tortelli.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.095
He wants you, you got no choice.

06:36.596 --> 06:41.067
This is the part I don't get.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.820
Here's a man that
quicksand would spit up...

06:46.239 --> 06:51.110
...and yet he has this strange
Svengali-like power over you.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.995
Oh, yes.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.997
From the moment I first saw him,

06:54.997 --> 06:58.501
I knew I'd follow him
to the ends of the earth.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.504
Where he's obviously
spent a lot of time.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.506
You know, there's,

07:03.506 --> 07:05.508
there's something about him.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.510
I mean, he knows women.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.012
Like a jeweler knows jewels.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.514
Like a meat cutter knows meat.

07:11.514 --> 07:16.969
Like a marine biologist knows marines.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.978
Knowing me as well as I do,

07:25.978 --> 07:28.481
I'll probably end up
crawling right back to him.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.483
Yeah, and he'll be there waiting

07:30.483 --> 07:32.985
with that cute look on his face

07:32.985 --> 07:34.987
and those three little words,

07:34.987 --> 07:37.874
"She's my cousin."

07:41.127 --> 07:43.129
You're not crawling back to him.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.131
We're gonna fight this together.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.415
You don't need that reptile.

07:46.415 --> 07:48.417
You can take care of yourself.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.419
But what'll I do?

07:50.419 --> 07:52.171
Well, you must be good at something.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.976
Well... I'm great at singing.

07:56.976 --> 07:57.844
Okay.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.179
In fact, before I married Nick,

08:00.179 --> 08:03.182
I was on my way to
becoming a taller, blonder,

08:03.182 --> 08:06.185
less Mormon Marie Osmond.

08:09.605 --> 08:12.108
Loretta, if Nick's going
to treat you this way,

08:12.108 --> 08:14.610
you can't let him come
between you and your career.

08:14.610 --> 08:16.112
You're right.

08:16.112 --> 08:18.614
I've got to sing again.

08:18.614 --> 08:20.616
Do you think Sam would let me sing here?

08:20.616 --> 08:22.418
Let me take care of it.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.786
I can talk him into anything.

08:25.671 --> 08:29.041
SAM: No, Diane, I told
you. Absolutely not.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.510
I wish you'd reconsider.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.011
Oh, please... Loretta needs a job.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.932
And you've never had a singer before.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.433
Oh, I've had a singer.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.352
You probably mean...

08:41.721 --> 08:43.722
Yes, in the bar.

08:43.722 --> 08:44.724
Right. It might be

08:44.724 --> 08:46.108
good for business.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.894
I, uh...

08:47.894 --> 08:49.896
I don't need a-a singer.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.397
C-Can you waitress?

08:51.397 --> 08:55.618
No, but I can do a salute
to waitresses in my act.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.654
Come on, it's only temporary,

08:58.654 --> 09:00.039
until she can get back on her feet.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.159
Okay, all right. Okay.

09:03.159 --> 09:06.162
I ran across an interesting
fact the other day.

09:06.162 --> 09:09.165
You know, if I took a,
uh, ride in a spaceship

09:09.165 --> 09:11.167
at the speed of light for ten years,

09:11.167 --> 09:13.169
when I return, I'd be ten years older,

09:13.169 --> 09:15.671
but everybody else here
would be 80 years older.

09:15.671 --> 09:17.173
Now, do you realize

09:17.173 --> 09:19.675
the ramifications of that?

09:19.675 --> 09:22.178
Yeah, for once you'd be the
best player on our softball team.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.682
I just can't discuss science with you.

09:27.183 --> 09:28.184
Cliffie, Cliffie...

09:28.184 --> 09:30.186
Give me a break. W-Wait!

09:31.687 --> 09:32.688
Carla!

09:32.688 --> 09:34.690
Nick.

09:34.690 --> 09:36.075
Long time, no see.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.944
You do somethin' to your hair?

09:37.944 --> 09:39.445
No.

09:39.445 --> 09:40.446
Think about it.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.949
(wheezing laughter)

09:42.949 --> 09:45.451
Nick, be a cannibal.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.837
Eat a rat.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.339
The magic is still there, Carla.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.208
Whatever happened between us?

09:52.208 --> 09:54.627
You lied, you cheated,
you neglected the kids,

09:54.627 --> 09:57.129
you never came home,
and you drank too much.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.631
Nah. It'd have to be more than that.

10:03.302 --> 10:06.305
Say the word, blondie,
and we can happen.

10:11.110 --> 10:16.115
I'd rather be the love toy
of a Greek army battalion.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.617
Who wouldn't?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.988
But dreaming gets you nowhere.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.372
Nicky!

10:23.372 --> 10:24.874
Loretta.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.375
I've decided to forgive you

10:26.375 --> 10:30.246
for bursting in on me and
Miss Romero in the shower.

10:30.246 --> 10:32.164
I'm sorry, Nicky.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.667
You oughta be. It was very embarrassing.

10:34.667 --> 10:35.668
Let's go home.

10:35.668 --> 10:36.886
Okay.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.220
Be strong.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.722
I mean...

10:39.722 --> 10:41.590
No.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.513
That sounded negative to me.

10:47.513 --> 10:49.932
I'm here for you.

10:49.932 --> 10:52.435
I'm not going home with you.

10:52.435 --> 10:53.436
I'm leaving you, Nick.

10:53.436 --> 10:54.437
NICK: Uh...

10:54.437 --> 10:56.439
get-g-get in the
car, sugar lump.

10:56.439 --> 10:57.690
Don't make me mad now.

10:57.690 --> 10:58.991
Hey, Nick, why don't
you leave her alone?

10:58.991 --> 11:00.993
Uh, Sam, she's coming home with me.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.363
Uh, in case you have forgotten,
she is my, uh, betrothed.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.083
She doesn't want to go
back to him. All right.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.417
Please help her. I know. I know.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.418
Nick, come on. Beat it.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.420
She doesn't want to be
around you right now.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.922
Eh, Sam, buddy, uh,
it is not a good thing

11:12.922 --> 11:14.423
for them to see us fighting here.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.425
Uh, these people, uh,
they look up to us.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.427
Uh, we're role models.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.932
Then don't make me ask again.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.934
Okay, okay, I'm not looking for trouble.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.802
Eh, but mark my words.

11:26.802 --> 11:29.605
Eh, I'm coming back for my woman.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.107
Oh, Sam,

11:31.107 --> 11:32.475
you stood up for me.

11:32.475 --> 11:34.810
Nobody's ever done that for me before.

11:34.810 --> 11:35.811
Oh.

11:35.811 --> 11:37.813
Sam, I'm aghast.

11:37.813 --> 11:39.115
What?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.566
You of all people?!

11:40.566 --> 11:43.069
Have you no respect
for our blessed union?

11:43.069 --> 11:44.987
Oh, come on, Nick.

11:44.987 --> 11:46.489
There's nothing going on here.

11:46.489 --> 11:47.990
I'm not interested in Loretta.

11:47.990 --> 11:49.875
Uh, I got one thing to say to you, Sam.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.379
Two can play the same game.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.881
You took my woman...

11:59.385 --> 12:02.388
...I'm gonna take yours.

12:02.671 --> 12:04.256
Me?

12:04.256 --> 12:05.257
You're taking me?

12:05.257 --> 12:07.760
The only thing you should be taking

12:07.760 --> 12:09.762
is penicillin.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.232
This is great.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.600
Nick is gonna cast

12:14.600 --> 12:16.435
a love spell on Miss Goody Two Shoes,

12:16.435 --> 12:18.320
and I get to watch.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.107
Actually, I'm not gonna make
my romantic approach tonight.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.359
It's getting too late for that.

12:23.359 --> 12:28.164
Ah, yes, goodness... look at the time.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.336
Time.

12:34.336 --> 12:37.840
Time to lay back.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.711
Time to forget your inhibitions.

12:42.711 --> 12:45.297
This is diabolical.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.133
From this day forward,

12:47.133 --> 12:49.635
there will be nobody for you but me.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.637
You will fall hopelessly in love

12:51.637 --> 12:55.641
and follow me to the ends of the earth.

12:57.143 --> 13:01.397
Oh, yeah... and bring a six-pack.

13:05.234 --> 13:06.735
God, the man is insane to think

13:06.735 --> 13:07.987
that anyone would be

13:07.987 --> 13:11.323
gullible enough to fall
for that idiotic nonsense.

13:28.090 --> 13:32.595
LORETTA: ? Mr. Sandman,
bring me a dream. ?

13:32.595 --> 13:34.063
(applause)

13:34.563 --> 13:35.564
Thank you, thank you.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.067
You've been a wonderful audience.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.569
Expecting someone, Diane?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.572
No, not really.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.074
Sure you are.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.076
He's out there somewhere.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.078
Waiting.

13:49.078 --> 13:52.081
I've heard so much about
Nick Tortelli's magic,

13:52.081 --> 13:53.582
but it's been a week,

13:53.582 --> 13:56.085
and I haven't seen any evidence of it.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.586
Don't you see what he's doing?

13:57.586 --> 13:58.587
It's all part of his plan.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.589
You know, like when the drums stop

14:00.589 --> 14:02.091
in a jungle movie?

14:02.091 --> 14:07.596
You sit and wonder...
what are the natives doing?

14:08.097 --> 14:11.600
And then you start to sweat.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.102
He's a genius.

14:13.102 --> 14:17.106
(makes bomb whistling, explosion sounds)

14:19.608 --> 14:21.110
Woody, I refuse to continue playing

14:21.110 --> 14:23.612
if every time you take
one of my pieces, you go...

14:23.612 --> 14:26.615
(makes whistling, explosion sounds)

14:26.615 --> 14:28.117
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane; I thought it added

14:28.117 --> 14:29.118
a little bit of excitement to the game.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.120
Well, it doesn't!

14:33.622 --> 14:35.124
Okay, Woody.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.127
You know, I think it's
time we took off the gloves.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.995
I have allowed you

14:39.995 --> 14:41.747
to defeat me several times

14:41.747 --> 14:43.749
because I was going easy on you,

14:43.749 --> 14:46.752
so as not to crush
your natural enthusiasm.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.637
But I think it's time

14:48.637 --> 14:51.006
you took a giant step toward maturity.

14:51.006 --> 14:54.510
There are a great many lessons
to be learned in defeat.

14:54.510 --> 14:57.012
Chief among them is
how to lose gracefully.

15:00.015 --> 15:01.016
Checkmate.

15:01.016 --> 15:03.018
(loud growling)

15:03.018 --> 15:05.020
You missed my king.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.021
(growling)

15:06.021 --> 15:08.407
(makes bomb whistling
and explosion sounds)

15:09.241 --> 15:10.993
Dr. Crane!

15:16.198 --> 15:17.666
Good night, Loretta.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.168
Thanks, Sam. Mm-hmm.

15:20.169 --> 15:24.173
Never again does she sing in this bar.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.175
Yes, dear.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.013
You know, Sammy,

15:31.013 --> 15:32.514
I know you kind of like Diane.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.016
(grunts softly)

15:34.016 --> 15:35.517
But you're gonna have to face it.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.519
She's his now.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.021
Oh, come on, will you stop it?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.522
I mean, Nick
and Diane--

15:40.522 --> 15:42.391
they don't even belong
on the same planet.

15:42.391 --> 15:44.693
The guy doesn't have any table manners.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.946
I mean, he thinks he's
God's gift to women.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.732
And when was the last time
he even picked up a book?

15:49.732 --> 15:51.984
How's that different from you, Sam?

15:51.984 --> 15:55.287
All right, there's a big difference...

15:55.287 --> 15:56.705
there's a big difference

15:57.206 --> 16:00.209
between thinking you're
God's gift and knowing it.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.628
(cash register dings)

16:04.129 --> 16:06.131
You know, Sammy, I, uh,
think Nick is getting to you.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.133
Why? You think I'm worried about this?

16:08.133 --> 16:10.135
Are you kidding? Uh-huh,
well, look at this.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.137
You added these receipts all wrong.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.640
I did not. Then you're saying

16:14.640 --> 16:17.059
we took in $32 million tonight?

16:17.059 --> 16:20.062
Well, there was that party of
ten in the corner table there.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.564
Yeah. I'm gonna go add
these on the machine, okay?

16:23.065 --> 16:24.066
Yeah, maybe you better.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.567
Uh...

16:25.567 --> 16:27.069
Diane, I'm going to go home now

16:27.569 --> 16:29.571
and watch the, uh, last
half of the Celtics game.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.073
All right?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.941
Okay, Sam.

16:32.941 --> 16:33.993
See you in the morning.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.779
Okay. I'll be dreaming of you.

16:36.779 --> 16:40.282
I'll be dreaming of me, too.

16:45.287 --> 16:46.789
Closing!

16:46.789 --> 16:49.291
(register dings)

17:03.305 --> 17:04.807
Good evening, Miss Chambers.

17:04.807 --> 17:08.777
Nick, you had better be here to tell me

17:08.777 --> 17:13.198
that you've given up your
quest to win my favor.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.733
Please, Miss Chambers,

17:15.733 --> 17:20.239
this is for you and you alone, my sweet.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.740
(loud whistle)

17:23.125 --> 17:29.048
(violins playing "As Time Goes By")

17:35.421 --> 17:37.256
God, you've got to be kidding!

17:37.256 --> 17:40.175
In matters of amore,
Nick Tortelli never kids.

17:40.175 --> 17:41.510
Sit.

17:41.510 --> 17:43.729
I am not a dog.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.013
Of course you're not.

17:45.013 --> 17:46.515
You think I'd spend this
kinda dough on an ug-o?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.685
Now, come on.

17:49.685 --> 17:53.188
We have a night of magic ahead of us.

17:53.188 --> 17:55.074
Let us commence.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.861
Nick, there will be no
dinner, no magic, no us.

17:58.861 --> 18:01.113
You and I have to talk.

18:01.113 --> 18:03.949
Now, please, sit down.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.951
Okay.

18:05.951 --> 18:08.454
(snaps fingers)

18:16.378 --> 18:21.383
Nick... will you give up on me?

18:21.383 --> 18:23.385
You and I are an impossibility.

18:23.385 --> 18:27.773
The only thing you instill
in me is the desire to flee.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.611
And then to be de-flea'd.

18:35.114 --> 18:39.618
I'm sensing that, uh, we're not
gonna hit the sheets together.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.622
That is correct.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.990
Save it!

18:44.990 --> 18:45.991
(violins stop)

18:45.991 --> 18:49.495
Why are you wasting your time on this?

18:49.495 --> 18:50.963
Loretta's the woman for you.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.882
She's spending all of her time with Sam.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.885
Women can't get their
eyes off of that guy.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.388
I guess, in his own
way, he's good-looking.

18:59.388 --> 19:05.394
Oh, Nick, you're every bit
as... mistaken as you can be.

19:07.262 --> 19:09.765
Sam and Loretta are not an item.

19:09.765 --> 19:11.266
Sam is mine.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.184
So, why don't you

19:12.651 --> 19:14.153
do something decent for once

19:14.153 --> 19:16.655
and go back and make your marriage work?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.607
(whispering): Get up, get up, get up!

19:18.607 --> 19:19.491
What's going on here?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.944
Surprise!

19:26.615 --> 19:30.619
I just came because I
forgot my... my charts.

19:30.619 --> 19:31.620
Is this all for me?

19:31.620 --> 19:33.121
Of course it's for you.

19:33.121 --> 19:36.124
It's my attempt to win
you back into my heart.

19:36.124 --> 19:38.126
Isn't that right, Miss Chambers?

19:38.126 --> 19:39.511
Oh, yes, yes.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.930
He's really a sweet
guy, isn't he, Loretta?

19:41.930 --> 19:43.432
He sure is.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.800
Yeah. If he

19:44.800 --> 19:45.801
weren't already taken,

19:46.301 --> 19:47.686
I'd snap him up for myself.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.606
Well, I'll leave you
two lovebirds alone.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.108
I'm just going in the
back to freshen up.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.611
I'll be out of here
in just a few minutes.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.614
I really like that Debbie.

20:01.116 --> 20:07.122
Uh... Loretta, if I have
caused you, uh, any heartache,

20:07.122 --> 20:08.123
I want to say I'm sorry.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.626
But I really do love you,
and I know you love me,

20:10.626 --> 20:13.879
and it's crazy for
us not to be together.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.165
You're the only woman on Earth for me.

20:17.666 --> 20:20.969
How come the cake says "Nick and Diane"?

20:20.969 --> 20:22.921
Excuse me?

20:22.921 --> 20:26.808
How come the cake says "Nick and Diane"?

20:26.808 --> 20:29.678
You know what a lousy speller I am.

20:29.678 --> 20:33.181
Oh, right.

20:37.102 --> 20:41.106
But, wait, that's pretty bad.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.363
This wasn't for me after all, was it?

20:48.363 --> 20:50.666
This was for some girl named Diane!

20:50.666 --> 20:52.167
No!

20:52.167 --> 20:53.585
It's no use.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.588
We're through forever.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.461
If you ever need a singer,
I'm available for any gig.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.848
Cut it!

21:08.350 --> 21:09.601
Nick.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.437
Carla!

21:12.437 --> 21:15.107
(violins playing)

21:15.107 --> 21:18.360
What's all this?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.646
This is for you, my sweet.

21:22.564 --> 21:24.566
All this is for me?

21:24.566 --> 21:26.068
Yeah. And if this

21:26.068 --> 21:29.037
is not an attempt at reconciliation,

21:29.538 --> 21:31.540
uh, I don't know what is.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.041
This is.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.046
You don't believe me?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.551
Whose lipstick is on the glass?

21:42.551 --> 21:46.555
What? I'm gonna have
the caterer flogged.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.806
Right, Nick.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.142
I hope you guys got your money up front.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.518
Nick?

22:03.939 --> 22:06.942
Diane. Diane, look how fate once again

22:06.942 --> 22:09.945
has brought us together this evening.

22:09.945 --> 22:12.948
Uh, excuse me if I don't get up for you.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.418
Where's Loretta?

22:16.418 --> 22:17.703
Uh, I don't know.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.705
She, uh, she got up and ran out on me.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.090
Uh, apparently, she
didn't like the cake.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.042
Nick, do yourself a favor.

22:24.042 --> 22:28.046
Get up out of that chair,
march out that door...

22:28.046 --> 22:29.431
Do you mind?

22:29.431 --> 22:30.432
(music stops)

22:30.432 --> 22:33.268
March out that door,

22:33.268 --> 22:36.271
find your wife, take her in your arms,

22:36.271 --> 22:39.274
sweep her up off her
feet, and tell her that

22:39.775 --> 22:43.278
"if our hearts cannot be
as one for all eternity,

22:43.278 --> 22:45.781
life will have lost all meaning."

22:45.781 --> 22:47.149
Okay, I'll do that.

22:49.151 --> 22:50.652
That's it, boys. You're off the clock.

22:50.652 --> 22:52.154
Find your own ways home.

22:53.905 --> 22:55.741
NICK: Loretta!

23:00.495 --> 23:02.998
Did I miss something here?

23:03.999 --> 23:07.502
Men. They are so stupid.

23:07.502 --> 23:09.004
What are you

23:09.004 --> 23:10.505
doing here?

23:10.505 --> 23:12.507
Oh, well, I thought
it was more important

23:12.507 --> 23:13.508
for me to be here with you

23:13.508 --> 23:16.011
than watching some silly
old basketball game.

23:16.011 --> 23:18.513
Your TV's broken? Yeah.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.819
This whole thing is so
sad, really very sad.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.187
Oh, that's all right.

23:25.187 --> 23:27.072
It's under warranty.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.324
It'll be okay.

23:29.324 --> 23:32.611
No, I'm talking about life.

23:32.611 --> 23:33.995
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

23:33.995 --> 23:37.365
How a good woman can make all
the difference in the world,

23:37.365 --> 23:40.752
and yet men are constantly
letting them slip away.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.421
Mm...

23:45.207 --> 23:48.210
I hope you don't let that happen to you

23:48.210 --> 23:50.595
and a certain flaxen-haired beauty

23:50.595 --> 23:53.048
in your life. (chuckling)

23:53.048 --> 23:54.049
Don't worry.

23:54.049 --> 23:55.934
I won't.

24:00.889 --> 24:04.893
