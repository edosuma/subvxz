01:01.505 --> 01:02.872
Lying lands right here.

01:02.940 --> 01:04.072
Smack dab in front of me.

01:04.141 --> 01:06.208
When it comes to lying, I'm your man.

01:06.276 --> 01:09.243
That makes Dr. Lightman very special.

01:09.311 --> 01:12.913
So, since you dragged
me away from my work,

01:12.981 --> 01:14.715
who can tell me what a lie is?

01:14.782 --> 01:17.783
When my mom tells my dad
he's not getting a big belly?

01:17.851 --> 01:21.386
Yeah. Right. We learn
to lie from grown-ups.

01:21.454 --> 01:23.654
They think you don't notice, but you do.

01:23.722 --> 01:25.556
Most of the time lying is bad, right?

01:25.624 --> 01:28.025
Even if you think you're
doing it for a good reason.

01:28.093 --> 01:30.293
Trust me, life's a lot easier
if you learn to tell the truth.

01:30.361 --> 01:31.727
Lightman is miserable.

01:31.795 --> 01:33.896
What strings did you pull
to get him to do this?

01:33.964 --> 01:35.697
I had Emily ask.

01:35.765 --> 01:37.298
She tutors a couple of the kids.

01:37.366 --> 01:40.768
Thought I could turn our class
problem into a teachable moment.

01:40.835 --> 01:42.502
That'd be a help.

01:42.570 --> 01:46.072
So, even if you're just thinking
of not telling me the truth,

01:46.140 --> 01:50.709
I'll warn you. It's pretty
hard to keep a lie from me.

01:50.776 --> 01:54.278
Go on. Go on, I dare you.

01:54.346 --> 01:58.315
Eh? Right. Clyde the turtle.

01:58.382 --> 01:59.849
Which one of you stole
Clyde the turtle...

01:59.917 --> 02:02.118
From miss Angela's classroom? Eh?

02:03.419 --> 02:05.286
No takers?

02:05.354 --> 02:07.655
All of you are innocent, are you?

02:07.723 --> 02:08.689
Eh?

02:08.757 --> 02:10.024
We need to talk.

02:10.091 --> 02:12.258
All right. Good. Boys and girls,

02:12.326 --> 02:15.094
meet FBI Agent Benjamin Reynolds.

02:15.162 --> 02:17.797
Oh, hey, kids, how ya doing?

02:17.864 --> 02:19.731
Hi. Hey, agent Ben.

02:19.799 --> 02:22.067
We need to talk. Foster's waiting.

02:22.134 --> 02:23.201
You, too. Come on.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.602
All right.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.538
Oh, and by the way,

02:28.606 --> 02:31.741
whoever it is that
stole Clyde the turtle,

02:31.809 --> 02:34.376
the turtle's... they're like lettuce,

02:34.444 --> 02:36.411
or is that tortoises?

02:36.479 --> 02:38.613
I'm gonna work on that one.

02:39.615 --> 02:41.716
Take a look at this screen.

02:41.783 --> 02:44.251
This guy parked right in front
of the treasury department annex.

02:44.319 --> 02:46.019
That's like two blocks from here.

02:46.087 --> 02:47.153
Yeah.

02:47.221 --> 02:48.287
How long's he been there?

02:48.355 --> 02:50.056
Little under 15 minutes.

02:50.123 --> 02:53.058
Anybody consider this
might be a peaceful protest?

02:53.126 --> 02:55.226
911, what is your emergency?

02:55.294 --> 02:57.094
A crazy farmer named Harold Clark...

02:57.162 --> 02:58.696
is driving up to Washington, D.C.

02:58.763 --> 03:00.564
to blow you federal folks up.

03:00.632 --> 03:02.132
How do you know this?

03:02.199 --> 03:04.000
He's got his tractor
and trailer packed...

03:04.068 --> 03:06.368
with enough explosives
to blow up the whole town.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.270
So not a peaceful protest then?

03:08.338 --> 03:09.638
Yeah. Who's the caller?

03:09.706 --> 03:10.906
We don't know yet.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.073
The call was relayed here,

03:12.141 --> 03:13.808
but the subscriber
information didn't convey.

03:13.876 --> 03:14.875
We're waiting to retrieve it now.

03:14.943 --> 03:16.043
Is there anything else to support...

03:16.111 --> 03:17.844
the fact that he actually
has a bomb in there?

03:17.912 --> 03:20.113
That's what we need you all for.

03:20.180 --> 03:21.347
So the question at hand is,

03:21.415 --> 03:22.849
is the threat real or is it a hoax?

03:22.916 --> 03:24.416
We need to get these
kids out of here now.

03:24.484 --> 03:25.851
No. We're not doing that.

03:25.919 --> 03:27.419
Protocol is anyone
within the bomb radius...

03:27.487 --> 03:29.454
stays inside and away
from exterior windows.

03:29.521 --> 03:31.655
In situations like these
more people are killed...

03:31.723 --> 03:33.724
by flying glass than the blast itself.

03:33.792 --> 03:35.959
Plus, this guy, he may
be waiting for people...

03:36.027 --> 03:37.360
to evacuate just so he can trigger it.

03:37.428 --> 03:39.728
So, everyone... including those kids...

03:39.796 --> 03:42.664
is staying right here until
we can figure this thing out.

03:42.732 --> 03:46.334
I was hoping you were going to say that.

03:46.335 --> 03:50.235
Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35

04:17.625 --> 04:20.394
All right. I've got us tapped
into the bureau's cameras.

04:20.462 --> 04:23.263
All right. Tight as you can.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.498
Tighter.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.668
All right. Come on, come on.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.071
So, what do we know about this man?

04:33.138 --> 04:35.739
It's like the caller said,
the guy's name is Harold Clark.

04:35.806 --> 04:37.573
He has... well, he had a family farm...

04:37.641 --> 04:39.408
right outside Fredericksburg, Virginia.

04:39.476 --> 04:41.109
But it's now in foreclosure.

04:41.177 --> 04:42.711
He definitely seems agitated.

04:42.778 --> 04:44.679
No, he's anxious.

04:44.747 --> 04:47.214
Yeah, which I might be if the
President didn't take my call.

04:47.282 --> 04:49.149
Oh, come on. You know
that's not gonna happen.

04:49.217 --> 04:53.720
No, what I'm saying is I'm not
seeing mad bomber anxiety here.

04:53.787 --> 04:55.688
Do you have any of your agents
going on to this guy's farm?

04:55.756 --> 04:56.856
Yeah, from the Richmond office.

04:56.923 --> 04:58.090
Where's Torres?

04:58.158 --> 05:00.725
Do you think she's ready
to handle this on her own?

05:00.793 --> 05:02.393
No, but we seem to be
under lockdown here,

05:02.461 --> 05:04.161
so I'm willing to lower
the bar. Where is she?

05:04.229 --> 05:06.130
Helping set up her cousin's quinceanera.

05:06.198 --> 05:07.231
Ah. Well, hold the cake.

05:07.298 --> 05:09.499
Let's send her down to the farmhouse.

05:09.567 --> 05:12.301
Let's see what his family
thinks of this little field trip.

05:12.369 --> 05:13.569
What about the kids?

05:13.637 --> 05:16.805
I'm all over it.

05:16.873 --> 05:18.873
Ok, you guys, let's go. Quietly.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.143
Wait. Come here, you.

05:22.210 --> 05:24.778
Hand it over.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.013
Yeah. Nice try, son.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.514
That's how I got it.

05:27.581 --> 05:29.649
We need you all in the
conference room, ok?

05:29.717 --> 05:30.583
Why?

05:30.651 --> 05:31.651
Because it's awesome.

05:31.718 --> 05:32.651
Come on.

05:32.719 --> 05:34.586
Go after him. Go on.

05:34.654 --> 05:35.888
Let's go.

05:37.557 --> 05:39.090
Is something wrong?

05:39.158 --> 05:40.792
We have a bit of a situation.

05:40.859 --> 05:44.795
We just need you all
away from... any windows.

05:47.632 --> 05:49.232
Hey, 8 third-graders...

05:49.300 --> 05:51.100
In a room with no toys and no puppies?

05:51.168 --> 05:52.835
It's going to be chaos.

05:52.903 --> 05:53.936
Yeah. Speaking of puppies,

05:54.004 --> 05:55.170
you like kids, don't you?

05:55.238 --> 05:56.238
No.

05:56.305 --> 05:57.472
Ok.

05:58.574 --> 06:01.575
Boys and girls, this
is crazy uncle Loker.

06:01.643 --> 06:05.279
He's going to be continuing
our education on lying.

06:05.346 --> 06:06.279
For how long?

06:06.347 --> 06:08.014
As long as it takes.

06:11.852 --> 06:13.352
Hey.

06:15.655 --> 06:16.821
Torres is en route.

06:16.889 --> 06:19.957
Oh. This is my boss, Isaac Steele.

06:20.025 --> 06:21.726
Dr. Cal Lightman.

06:21.793 --> 06:25.128
Yo. Steele. Thanks for
letting us set up here.

06:25.196 --> 06:26.396
All right, my office,

06:26.464 --> 06:28.164
my science you're obviously after.

06:28.232 --> 06:31.400
It's under my command. Ok?

06:34.704 --> 06:36.471
Where are we doing this?

06:36.539 --> 06:39.474
I have some information
you need to hear.

06:40.309 --> 06:41.976
All right.

06:42.043 --> 06:44.011
Optical chemical sensors
are picking up traces...

06:44.078 --> 06:46.813
Of ammonium nitrates and
diesel fuel from the trailer.

06:46.881 --> 06:49.148
Aren't those pretty
standard farmyard smells?

06:49.216 --> 06:51.584
Yes, but he could also have
an anfo bomb big enough...

06:51.651 --> 06:53.485
to take out several
blocks of downtown D.C.

06:53.553 --> 06:54.886
Right.

06:54.954 --> 06:56.554
Collateral damage-wise there's
a pretty strong case here...

06:56.622 --> 06:58.256
For death by sniper, wouldn't you say?

06:58.323 --> 07:01.225
I mean, you only need to
be 30% sure he's got a bomb,

07:01.293 --> 07:04.194
then just kill him,
taking one human life...

07:04.262 --> 07:06.496
By saving thousands of others...

07:06.564 --> 07:08.031
Including those kids in there.

07:08.098 --> 07:10.499
You're the expert. That's the
call you're going to have to make.

07:10.567 --> 07:12.835
What? Do I look like
an FBI puppet to you?

07:12.902 --> 07:16.071
Your offices, your command,
you're the one who said that.

07:16.138 --> 07:17.939
Yeah, I did say that.

07:18.007 --> 07:20.441
All right. No, thanks.

07:21.443 --> 07:22.542
Cal! Cal!

07:22.610 --> 07:25.078
Come on, look, look, look.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.146
My Boss is a really good guy, ok?

07:27.214 --> 07:29.281
But he's not equipped to figure
this thing out the you are.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.749
So, come on, man. We need to know.

07:30.817 --> 07:34.018
Does that guy have a
bomb in a trailer or not?

07:34.086 --> 07:35.620
All right.

07:36.722 --> 07:38.556
All right. Well, if
I'm going to do this,

07:38.623 --> 07:39.623
I'll need to deal with him personally,

07:39.691 --> 07:41.124
so can you put me through?

07:41.192 --> 07:42.159
We have our own negotiators.

07:42.226 --> 07:44.327
Bombers have a messiah complex so...

07:44.395 --> 07:46.095
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Avoid
discussion of the bomber's...

07:46.163 --> 07:47.897
present crisis in
order to prevent him...

07:47.964 --> 07:50.999
from exercising his God-like
power to destroy and kill...

07:51.067 --> 07:54.102
Yeah. I wrote that bit in the manual.

07:54.170 --> 07:57.405
Is that true?

07:57.473 --> 07:59.340
Well, when you're ready...

08:00.875 --> 08:02.042
All right.

08:11.151 --> 08:12.017
Hello.

08:12.085 --> 08:14.586
Harold, I'm Cal Lightman.

08:14.654 --> 08:16.654
Do you have the president with you?

08:16.722 --> 08:17.689
No, no, not right now,

08:17.756 --> 08:19.890
but I'm calling at his request.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.459
Call me back when you got him.

08:24.062 --> 08:25.995
What do I know?

08:38.774 --> 08:39.774
Yes?

08:39.841 --> 08:40.774
Mary Clark?

08:40.842 --> 08:42.775
Who are you?

08:42.844 --> 08:44.611
May we come inside, ma'am?

08:44.679 --> 08:46.646
My friends are here.

08:46.714 --> 08:48.581
Oh, this won't take long.

08:51.117 --> 08:53.618
We are live outside the
treasury department annex...

08:53.686 --> 08:55.620
in northwest Washington, D.C.

08:55.688 --> 08:57.121
Where a disgruntled...

08:57.189 --> 08:59.323
Has Harold ever talked about taking
action against the government?

08:59.390 --> 09:01.558
Mrs. Clark?

09:01.626 --> 09:05.995
He complained, you know, like everyone
else about taxes and the economy.

09:06.063 --> 09:09.064
I just, uh... I can't believe
he's up there in damn D.C.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.465
With his tractor.

09:10.533 --> 09:12.934
So you did not know that he
was going to go do this today?

09:13.002 --> 09:14.569
No. No.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.038
He talked about, um...

09:17.105 --> 09:19.273
Maybe going up there with a megaphone...

09:19.340 --> 09:22.275
and, uh, calling out them bastards...

09:22.343 --> 09:24.677
In the treasury
department, but not this.

09:24.745 --> 09:26.913
It sounds like Harold's pretty angry.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.014
You're damn right he's pissed.

09:29.082 --> 09:31.550
They took his family farm.

09:31.617 --> 09:34.686
Three generations, they had it.

09:34.753 --> 09:37.354
Ma'am, it's not a huge
leap from anger to violence.

09:37.422 --> 09:39.623
Does he have a bomb in
that trailer he towed?

09:39.690 --> 09:43.592
You listen to me... Harold
and I have been together...

09:43.660 --> 09:45.094
since sophomore year in high school.

09:45.162 --> 09:47.396
I know this man.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.197
He would never hurt anyone.

09:49.265 --> 09:50.665
You didn't answer the question, ma'am.

09:50.733 --> 09:52.800
No, he doesn't have a damn bomb.

09:52.868 --> 09:55.536
He just...

09:55.604 --> 09:58.338
He just wants to talk to the president.

09:58.406 --> 10:00.073
You don't believe that.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.176
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have fear all over your face.

10:05.212 --> 10:07.613
I'm not afraid of what he's going to do.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.415
I'm afraid of what you
all are going to do to him.

10:10.483 --> 10:13.784
So, unless you have a
search warrant to be here,

10:13.852 --> 10:16.920
I'd really like it if
you'd leave my home.

10:16.988 --> 10:18.622
I can get a warrant in 10 minutes.

10:18.690 --> 10:20.356
Then get it.

10:25.495 --> 10:28.630
Reading emotions helps us discover lies.

10:28.698 --> 10:31.799
Who wants to tell me what
emotion this person is feeling?

10:31.867 --> 10:34.701
This one and that one.

10:37.371 --> 10:38.905
Hmm?

10:40.074 --> 10:41.173
Contempt.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.876
I don't think they know what that is.

10:43.943 --> 10:46.178
Is this really science? It seems dumb.

10:46.245 --> 10:48.146
We were supposed to
leave half an hour ago.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.580
Why are we still here?

10:49.648 --> 10:51.082
Now's when we have music class.

10:51.149 --> 10:52.249
Yeah.

10:52.317 --> 10:53.651
Isn't this better than music class?

10:53.718 --> 10:54.651
No.

10:54.719 --> 10:55.719
Dr. Cal!

10:55.787 --> 10:56.920
They want to know why they're here...

10:56.988 --> 10:58.655
Instead of back in music class,

10:58.723 --> 11:00.056
which is where they
normally are at this time.

11:00.124 --> 11:01.824
It's my fault.

11:01.892 --> 11:02.925
I told your bus driver
to go and pick up...

11:02.993 --> 11:04.026
A couple of friends
of mine at the airport.

11:04.094 --> 11:05.761
And the plane was late,
so he's stuck there,

11:05.829 --> 11:06.928
waiting for them. Sorry about that.

11:06.996 --> 11:08.563
Are you allowed to do that?

11:08.631 --> 11:11.365
Yeah, I got permission
from your principal.

11:12.534 --> 11:15.069
You know, someone in here
is definitely lying...

11:15.136 --> 11:18.972
About Clyde the turtle. I can smell it.

11:21.642 --> 11:26.344
Loker, get your guitar,
entertain the troops.

11:32.785 --> 11:34.552
Oh, it's Torres. Hey.

11:34.619 --> 11:35.586
I spoke to Harold's wife.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.154
She's definitely hiding something.

11:37.221 --> 11:38.321
Did you ask her about the bomb?

11:38.389 --> 11:41.157
Yeah, but she doesn't
believe he has one.

11:41.225 --> 11:43.559
Who ever heard of a husband
keeping secrets from his wife?

11:43.627 --> 11:46.795
The only thing I know for sure is
she doesn't believe he's violent.

11:46.863 --> 11:49.230
Well, keep after it, all right?

11:56.571 --> 11:58.038
Hello?

11:58.105 --> 12:00.139
Harold, I've got a question for you.

12:00.207 --> 12:03.042
Call me when you're ready to
let me speak with the president.

12:03.109 --> 12:05.210
Yeah, well, he wants to know
what you want to talk about.

12:05.278 --> 12:06.978
Is it global warming?
Death penalty? What?

12:07.046 --> 12:10.948
I want to talk about our tax
money being sent overseas,

12:11.016 --> 12:12.883
or bailing out banks,

12:12.951 --> 12:14.851
but letting our farmers
choke on their own crops.

12:14.919 --> 12:16.386
Somebody's got to stand
up and say something.

12:16.453 --> 12:18.187
All right. Well, I'll pass that on.

12:18.255 --> 12:20.055
In the meantime, could you
answer a question for me?

12:20.123 --> 12:21.790
Yeah, what is it?

12:21.858 --> 12:22.824
All right.

12:22.892 --> 12:23.992
What kind of bomb are we talking about?

12:24.060 --> 12:25.627
What?

12:25.694 --> 12:28.329
Well, there's a rumor going on around
here that you're sitting on a bomb.

12:28.397 --> 12:30.931
Is this you trying
to change the subject?

12:30.999 --> 12:33.133
No, no, we spoke to your
wife. She was a little off.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.401
I want the president.

12:36.403 --> 12:37.636
Let me replay that.

12:39.506 --> 12:41.006
What?

12:42.074 --> 12:44.442
When you asked him if he had a bomb,

12:44.510 --> 12:46.577
the left side of his lip tightened.

12:46.645 --> 12:49.046
It's contempt.

12:49.113 --> 12:50.247
He's being deceptive.

12:50.314 --> 12:52.015
So you're giving us the green light.

12:52.082 --> 12:53.649
What is it with you people?

12:53.717 --> 12:55.384
Why is it always red light, green light?

12:55.452 --> 12:56.786
What do you want me to do?

12:56.853 --> 12:57.953
Pull the trigger for you?

12:58.021 --> 12:59.721
Wait, wait, let me
explain something to you.

12:59.789 --> 13:02.223
I'm trying to save innocent
lives here, your included.

13:02.291 --> 13:03.992
All right? There are
no easy choices here.

13:04.059 --> 13:06.427
So let's all act like grownups,

13:06.495 --> 13:09.029
make the hard choices,
and salvage what we can.

13:09.097 --> 13:10.196
Right.

13:10.264 --> 13:12.732
Well, what I'm telling
you is that he's being...

13:12.800 --> 13:17.503
Deceptive in his
denial of having a bomb.

13:17.570 --> 13:21.573
I don't know yet what
that means exactly.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.341
It's good enough for me.

13:23.409 --> 13:26.410
Do it and I'll prep the snipers.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.241
All right. So once you're in place,

13:30.308 --> 13:31.675
concealed, and on target, sound off.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.309
Let's follow all protocols on this.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.410
No happy triggers.

13:34.478 --> 13:35.811
Roger that, sir.

13:35.879 --> 13:37.613
Do you guys have to
do this in the lobby?

13:37.681 --> 13:39.414
We've got a bunch of
kids here we've managed...

13:39.482 --> 13:40.582
to keep in the dark so far.

13:40.650 --> 13:41.916
Until I give the word,

13:41.984 --> 13:43.151
you are not authorized to shoot...

13:43.218 --> 13:44.719
unless someone's in immediate
danger. You got that?

13:44.786 --> 13:46.520
We'll be waiting for your green light.

13:46.588 --> 13:47.588
Then get going.

13:47.655 --> 13:48.822
Yes, sir!

13:55.695 --> 13:57.296
A little mood lighting?

13:57.364 --> 13:59.231
Yeah, the ballasts on
the fluorescent lights...

13:59.299 --> 14:02.367
Interferes with our video and
encrypted radio communications.

14:03.535 --> 14:04.969
All right, we're good to go.

14:05.037 --> 14:08.105
Now you've got some semblance
of a rapport with Harold.

14:08.173 --> 14:10.907
Keep him distracted while
the snipers move in, ok?

14:10.975 --> 14:12.309
Oh, that's nice.

14:12.376 --> 14:15.244
Remind me to renegotiate
my contract with you.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.146
We appreciate what you're doing, doctor.

14:17.214 --> 14:19.314
Yes, I know you do.

14:22.719 --> 14:23.652
Hello?

14:23.720 --> 14:24.619
Harold. Me again.

14:24.687 --> 14:26.521
I spoke with the President's office.

14:26.589 --> 14:28.022
When can I talk to him?

14:28.090 --> 14:29.424
Well, you need to promise me...

14:29.491 --> 14:31.592
that no one's going to get hurt here.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.527
I don't want anybody to get hurt.

14:35.496 --> 14:36.696
That was genuine.

14:36.764 --> 14:39.298
So I'll work with that or
I'm done here, all right?

14:40.901 --> 14:42.534
I believe you when you say that,

14:42.602 --> 14:44.803
but I don't think that you're telling
me the whole truth about the bomb.

14:44.871 --> 14:46.971
Quit stalling.

14:47.039 --> 14:49.907
Did you tell the President
what I wanted to talk about?

14:49.975 --> 14:51.475
Yeah, I did. I told him.

14:51.543 --> 14:54.377
But he wants to know what it
is that you want him to do.

14:54.445 --> 14:56.445
I'll tell him on the phone.

14:56.513 --> 14:58.547
Is your wife involved in this?

14:58.615 --> 15:01.483
No, no, this is all me.

15:01.551 --> 15:03.618
Quit playing games.

15:04.453 --> 15:05.653
Right.

15:05.721 --> 15:08.622
Ok. Seats 4, we're
going to have a concert.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.457
Ok.

15:10.525 --> 15:11.458
Hey.

15:11.526 --> 15:12.459
Hey.

15:12.527 --> 15:14.328
How dangerous is it out there?

15:14.396 --> 15:16.396
How dangerous is it in here?

15:16.464 --> 15:18.098
I don't know.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.799
But I trust Lightman,

15:19.867 --> 15:22.101
and it's my job to keep
these kids from freaking out.

15:22.169 --> 15:24.770
What if their teacher is freaked out?

15:24.837 --> 15:27.805
Well, I'll help her, too...

15:27.873 --> 15:31.275
But you've got to help
me with them first, ok?

15:32.310 --> 15:33.310
Ok.

15:33.378 --> 15:34.478
Ok.

15:34.545 --> 15:36.313
Who knows the words to
"puff, the magic dragon"?

15:36.381 --> 15:39.216
My mom said that song's
about illegal drugs.

15:42.185 --> 15:46.387
I don't think that's ever
been definitively proven.

15:46.455 --> 15:48.021
All sniper teams in position.

15:48.089 --> 15:49.256
All right. Copy that.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.191
You can go ahead and try and engage him.

15:51.259 --> 15:52.893
We're ready.

16:00.630 --> 16:02.063
You have the president?

16:02.131 --> 16:04.832
All right, Harold, a
little reality check here.

16:04.900 --> 16:08.701
Your situation is veering from
bad to worse by the minute.

16:08.769 --> 16:11.103
I'm getting cold, and I'm getting angry.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.738
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

16:12.806 --> 16:13.872
Well, that's unfortunate,

16:13.940 --> 16:16.308
because I'm the only person here...

16:16.375 --> 16:18.910
who has any desire to talk to you.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.779
I just want to talk to the president.

16:21.846 --> 16:23.547
Well, let's start with the truth then.

16:23.615 --> 16:25.882
What kind of bomb are
we talking about here?

16:32.555 --> 16:34.389
The bomb is rigged.

16:37.693 --> 16:38.626
How?

16:38.694 --> 16:40.528
It just is, ok?

16:40.595 --> 16:42.462
If you do anything to me,

16:42.530 --> 16:44.864
you try to hurt me, the bomb goes off.

16:44.932 --> 16:46.698
And if I don't speak directly...

16:46.766 --> 16:48.600
to the President before
the sun goes down,

16:48.667 --> 16:50.501
the bomb goes off!

16:50.569 --> 16:53.804
Look, man, all that can be avoided...

16:53.872 --> 16:56.540
if you just have the President call me.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.243
Is he telling the truth?

17:00.311 --> 17:01.810
Yeah.

17:03.079 --> 17:04.546
Yeah, I believe he is.

17:04.613 --> 17:07.181
But he's also showing fear.

17:07.248 --> 17:08.915
All right, it's the kind of fear...

17:08.983 --> 17:11.285
That you get when someone's
got a gun to your head.

17:11.353 --> 17:13.588
Believe me, I've seen that.

17:14.955 --> 17:16.756
You know what, zoom
into that tractor seat.

17:16.824 --> 17:18.090
Go ahead.

17:18.159 --> 17:19.492
Yeah. Lower.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.894
Lower, lower. Keep going, keep going...

17:22.929 --> 17:24.496
Right there...

17:28.031 --> 17:29.400
Oh, God.

17:31.137 --> 17:34.172
We didn't see it before because
his jacket was in the way.

17:38.343 --> 17:39.776
Sniper one to base.

17:39.844 --> 17:42.479
All sniper teams in position.
We're waiting for green light.

17:42.546 --> 17:43.813
Just hold your position, sniper team.

17:43.881 --> 17:46.048
You are not cleared to fire. Stand down.

17:46.116 --> 17:47.349
Sniper one is clear.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.717
Standing down.

17:48.785 --> 17:50.619
If this guy has a detonator
switch on his seat...

17:50.686 --> 17:53.154
and if we fire, that
might detonate the bomb.

17:54.556 --> 17:56.089
Let's use an LVB water disrupter.

17:56.157 --> 17:57.624
Is that what I think it is?

17:57.692 --> 17:59.692
It's a bomb we bring
in to kill his bomb.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.994
Oh, this is just getting
better and better, this is.

18:02.062 --> 18:04.630
I found something on the
911 call you should hear.

18:09.068 --> 18:12.403
A crazy farmer named Harold Clark
is driving up to Washington, D.C.

18:12.471 --> 18:14.171
to blow you federal folks up.

18:14.239 --> 18:15.805
One more time.

18:15.873 --> 18:19.041
A crazy farmer named Harold Clark
is driving up to Washington, D.C.

18:19.109 --> 18:20.743
To blow you federal folks up.

18:20.810 --> 18:22.744
All right, just that last little bit.

18:22.812 --> 18:24.112
Blow you federal folks up.

18:24.179 --> 18:25.413
Do you hear it?

18:25.480 --> 18:26.680
Yeah, he's smiling.

18:26.748 --> 18:27.747
What?

18:27.815 --> 18:28.915
The inflection of his voice changes...

18:28.983 --> 18:30.817
because a smile changes
the sound of your voice...

18:30.885 --> 18:33.219
by shortening the
voice resonance chamber.

18:33.287 --> 18:35.955
He's smiling as he says
"blow you federal folks up."

18:36.023 --> 18:38.490
Wait, you can tell someone's
smiling just by listening to him?

18:38.558 --> 18:40.659
You can't. We can.

18:40.726 --> 18:44.462
He know something you don't
and he's laughing at you.

18:44.530 --> 18:45.963
So what is this, a practical joke?

18:46.031 --> 18:47.764
No, I think he's telling the truth.

18:47.832 --> 18:50.967
He finds some kind
of sick humor in this.

18:51.035 --> 18:52.402
He may be connected to this.

18:52.469 --> 18:53.403
Yeah.

18:53.470 --> 18:56.705
Harold is not working on his own.

18:56.773 --> 18:59.775
We need to find this guy quick.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.745
No, I get it, I do.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.380
You're looking for someone to blame...

19:09.448 --> 19:10.581
In case this thing goes south, right?

19:10.649 --> 19:13.084
That's why you set up
your command center...

19:13.151 --> 19:15.819
In my office, effectively
putting my finger on the trigger.

19:15.887 --> 19:17.554
Well, what do you say we make sure...

19:17.622 --> 19:18.922
Before you just go ahead and kill him?

19:18.990 --> 19:19.990
Are you done?

19:20.058 --> 19:21.158
Because constitutionally speaking,

19:21.226 --> 19:23.460
you don't have to be
right to use deadly force,

19:23.528 --> 19:25.195
we just have to be reasonably sure.

19:25.263 --> 19:28.001
And in a world full of
bombs and lunatics...

19:28.069 --> 19:31.138
Sometimes there's no room
for scientific certainty.

19:31.206 --> 19:33.707
You know, you're so scared
of making a huge mistake,

19:33.775 --> 19:35.008
you're prepared to make a smaller,

19:35.076 --> 19:37.377
yet potentially still tragic one.

19:37.445 --> 19:38.511
You want this to end peacefully?

19:38.579 --> 19:40.746
You give me proof and
allow me to do that.

19:40.814 --> 19:44.316
All right. The 911 caller
was just ID'd as Ron Jackson.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.183
White male, 38, lives
near Harold in Virginia.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.716
Boss, we've got time.

19:47.784 --> 19:49.784
We should get Torres and one of
your agents over there right now.

19:49.852 --> 19:51.017
Yeah.

19:52.285 --> 19:54.517
In this situation stalling
and not making a decision...

19:54.585 --> 19:56.051
Is the same thing as making one.

19:56.119 --> 19:58.420
Well, I want to be certain of
the truth when I make my decision.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.955
Well, you better make it soon...

20:00.022 --> 20:02.524
Because the clock is
ticking on that bomb.

20:02.591 --> 20:05.126
Bomb? What bomb?

20:05.193 --> 20:07.361
He had to go to the bathroom.

20:07.428 --> 20:09.328
You're a big kid, right?

20:09.396 --> 20:10.963
You're not going to
turn into one of them...

20:11.030 --> 20:12.798
Whiny little cry babies, are you?

20:12.865 --> 20:14.499
Right. No?

20:14.566 --> 20:16.200
All right.

20:17.168 --> 20:18.535
Here's the truth...

20:18.602 --> 20:20.203
all right?

20:20.270 --> 20:25.206
Not far from here there's a
man who says he's got a bomb.

20:25.273 --> 20:27.508
He's trying to get
some people's attention.

20:27.576 --> 20:30.812
Now, maybe he has and maybe he's lying.

20:30.879 --> 20:33.080
But, in the meantime,
you and your mates,

20:33.147 --> 20:35.815
you're going to stay here,
just to be on the safe side.

20:35.883 --> 20:37.583
You got it? All right.

20:37.651 --> 20:40.388
Now, it's my job to
find out what's what...

20:40.455 --> 20:43.794
With this maybe-maybe
not bomb type thing,

20:43.862 --> 20:45.829
and I'm excellent at my job.

20:45.897 --> 20:47.030
Just ask Loker here.

20:47.098 --> 20:49.899
And it's your job to be
a top-notch third-grader.

20:49.967 --> 20:51.767
You up for it?

20:51.835 --> 20:53.402
Huh?

20:53.469 --> 20:56.070
You up for keeping this
a secret from your mates...

20:56.138 --> 20:58.138
So that they don't get all,
you know, scaredy cat on you?

20:58.206 --> 21:00.507
Good. All right.

21:01.508 --> 21:03.076
Well, go pee then.

21:14.122 --> 21:15.355
Excuse me.

21:17.759 --> 21:19.293
What can I do for you?

21:19.360 --> 21:20.527
I'm looking for Ron Jackson.

21:20.595 --> 21:21.461
Is he your husband?

21:21.528 --> 21:23.595
Don't remind me.

21:23.663 --> 21:24.696
Wait, ma'am.

21:24.764 --> 21:26.966
FBI.

21:27.033 --> 21:28.034
Where is he, ma'am?

21:28.101 --> 21:29.235
We need to talk to him.

21:29.303 --> 21:32.338
Sorry, I thought y'all
were bill collectors.

21:32.405 --> 21:34.307
Where's your husband, ma'am?

21:34.374 --> 21:36.142
Honestly, I got no idea.

21:36.210 --> 21:37.443
What's he done now?

21:37.511 --> 21:39.044
You know a man named Harold Clark?

21:39.112 --> 21:40.479
Yeah.

21:40.547 --> 21:41.913
I guess everyone knows Harold now.

21:41.981 --> 21:43.048
How do you know him?

21:43.115 --> 21:45.316
Him and Ron run a farmers' co-op.

21:45.384 --> 21:48.586
They mostly get together,
drink, and bitch about things.

21:48.653 --> 21:50.587
All right we take a look around, ma'am?

21:51.556 --> 21:54.624
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' to hide.

22:10.404 --> 22:13.909
Blasting caps for bombs.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.351
All right, look, just hear me out, ok?

22:24.418 --> 22:25.885
Maybe Jackson was an accomplice,

22:25.953 --> 22:28.521
but he got cold feet,
decided to call 911,

22:28.589 --> 22:29.822
and give up the whole plot.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.024
That doesn't explain the
smile behind his voice.

22:32.092 --> 22:33.925
What is that?

22:33.993 --> 22:35.460
Oh, that.

22:35.527 --> 22:37.428
That's how these boys plan to win this.

22:37.496 --> 22:38.829
It doesn't look like much, but...

22:38.897 --> 22:40.531
all right, look, here's the deal, ok?

22:40.598 --> 22:42.299
We're going to place that container
of water near Harold's bomb.

22:42.367 --> 22:44.634
There's a large quantity of c-4...

22:44.701 --> 22:45.868
in the middle of the container,

22:45.936 --> 22:47.035
which we will then detonate,

22:47.103 --> 22:49.605
sending the water out at 72 million psi.

22:49.673 --> 22:52.508
It will disrupt Harold's
bomb before it can explode.

22:52.576 --> 22:54.443
And Harold's birdfeed.

22:54.510 --> 22:56.444
He won't even know what hit him.

22:59.381 --> 23:01.383
Oh, this is going to be fun.

23:04.387 --> 23:05.684
Harold.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.817
What the hell is that
thing coming towards me?

23:07.885 --> 23:10.285
It's an x-Ray machine, Harold.

23:10.353 --> 23:11.486
We needed to map the bomb...

23:11.554 --> 23:13.688
So we can figure out
a safe evacuation plan.

23:13.755 --> 23:15.422
Tell me about Ron Jackson.

23:16.891 --> 23:18.591
You know about Ron?

23:18.658 --> 23:20.025
Yep.

23:20.093 --> 23:21.626
Better still, why don't you tell me...

23:21.694 --> 23:23.627
How to disable the bomb
so nobody gets hurt.

23:26.297 --> 23:29.431
I don't... I don't know how to stop it.

23:29.498 --> 23:30.932
It's not my bomb.

23:32.067 --> 23:33.567
Whose is it?

23:34.502 --> 23:35.669
Is it Jackson's?

23:35.736 --> 23:37.237
Is he pulling the strings?

23:38.372 --> 23:41.340
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

23:42.442 --> 23:45.044
He'll kill her if I
tell you guys anything.

23:46.380 --> 23:48.381
Kill who?

23:49.384 --> 23:51.120
Look, you might as well tell me.

23:51.188 --> 23:52.756
It's just us on the phone, all right?

23:52.824 --> 23:55.359
I mean... you're already
in a very bad spot.

23:55.427 --> 23:57.961
You do know that, don't you?

23:58.029 --> 24:01.464
They have someone in
my house with my wife.

24:01.532 --> 24:05.368
They're going to kill her if
I don't go through with this.

24:06.938 --> 24:09.539
I don't know what else to do.

24:12.810 --> 24:15.211
He's telling the truth.

24:16.833 --> 24:18.098
The Washington Metropolitan
Police Department...

24:21.133 --> 24:22.167
Torres.

24:22.234 --> 24:23.501
Hey, it's us. Are you at the clubhouse?

24:23.568 --> 24:25.236
Yeah, I'm working here.

24:25.303 --> 24:26.503
Where's agent Irving?

24:26.571 --> 24:28.572
Um, he's doing the search of the bar.

24:28.639 --> 24:30.006
Maria, give very simple answers...

24:30.074 --> 24:31.307
and don't let anyone think...

24:31.375 --> 24:32.875
What you're saying is important.

24:32.943 --> 24:34.911
Ok.

24:34.978 --> 24:36.479
Is there a man there named Dave Miller?

24:36.547 --> 24:38.080
He would've been there all day.

24:38.148 --> 24:39.615
Yeah.

24:39.683 --> 24:42.184
All right, I'm going to call
Irving and tell him to get in there.

24:42.252 --> 24:45.388
This man is probably armed
and he's willing to kill.

24:45.455 --> 24:48.658
Wow. I did not know that.

24:48.725 --> 24:50.593
He's there as a threat
against the wife...

24:50.660 --> 24:52.294
To force Harold to go through with this.

24:52.362 --> 24:53.395
That would certainly explain...

24:53.463 --> 24:54.396
The fear you saw earlier.

24:54.464 --> 24:57.533
Ok, well, that sounds fun.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.435
Hopefully, I can get tickets.

24:59.502 --> 25:00.769
Reynolds has been on with Agent Irving.

25:00.837 --> 25:02.537
He's on his way. Just
sit tight, all right?

25:02.605 --> 25:05.207
Cool. Let me know how it goes.

25:08.077 --> 25:09.945
Shouldn't be more than a few minutes.

25:10.012 --> 25:11.546
We'll get out of here.

25:11.614 --> 25:13.381
What were they saying about Harold?

25:13.449 --> 25:15.116
Find out what kind of bomb it is?

25:15.184 --> 25:16.885
No, no.

25:16.952 --> 25:19.921
But I do have some bad news.

25:19.989 --> 25:23.558
I don't think they're going to
let Harold talk to the president.

25:23.626 --> 25:24.726
Probably not.

25:24.794 --> 25:26.561
But I think I have a solution...

25:26.629 --> 25:29.030
To this whole thing and
you two know him well,

25:29.098 --> 25:31.199
obviously, so let me just run it by you.

25:31.266 --> 25:34.669
I have a friend who works in
assemblyman Kincaid's office.

25:34.736 --> 25:36.971
Maybe I call in a favor
and he can talk to Harold.

25:37.039 --> 25:41.341
That's, uh... that's not
really the same thing.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.910
But at least it's a phone call...

25:43.978 --> 25:45.879
with someone who works
in the government.

25:45.947 --> 25:49.116
Lady, quit wasting our time.

25:49.184 --> 25:51.584
That's kind of the point, actually.

25:51.652 --> 25:54.286
Put your hands over your head.

26:14.977 --> 26:16.311
People lie all the time.

26:16.378 --> 26:18.179
It must make you pretty cynical.

26:18.247 --> 26:21.617
Sometimes, but you get to
see the truth occasionally.

26:23.487 --> 26:26.289
Truth is, I'm really scared right now.

26:26.357 --> 26:27.724
I know.

26:27.791 --> 26:29.725
Me, too.

26:29.793 --> 26:31.993
Well, a little bit.

26:32.061 --> 26:35.896
I just... I want
another chance, you know?

26:35.964 --> 26:37.463
I'd do things different.

26:37.531 --> 26:39.331
Is that a stupid thing to say?

26:39.398 --> 26:42.333
No, not at all.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.636
Oscar's acting weird.

26:52.677 --> 26:55.579
Oscar, you ok?

26:55.646 --> 26:56.679
Hmm.

26:56.747 --> 26:58.447
Hey.

26:58.515 --> 27:00.449
You know, when I was your age,

27:00.517 --> 27:04.717
I had a crush on this
girl... older woman, really...

27:04.785 --> 27:06.317
sixth grader.

27:06.385 --> 27:09.352
I was always worrying about
it, stressing out about it,

27:09.420 --> 27:12.522
and then I realized there
was nothing you can do.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.624
Um...

27:18.165 --> 27:21.001
So, sometimes, when
there's nothing you can do,

27:21.068 --> 27:24.171
you just have to believe
everything is gonna be ok.

27:24.238 --> 27:26.272
And you write a song.

27:26.340 --> 27:30.210
Can't be worried and write a
song at the same time, right?

27:30.277 --> 27:33.713
I mean, you look to me like a guy
who can write some fantastic rhymes.

27:33.781 --> 27:35.315
Am I right?

27:35.383 --> 27:39.119
Yep, I can tell that about you.

27:39.186 --> 27:41.887
I can see it on your face.

27:41.955 --> 27:44.088
So, let's give it a shot.

27:44.156 --> 27:46.390
Your wife and your son are safe, Harold.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.058
Thank you.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.394
Tell me about Jackson.

27:50.461 --> 27:51.895
I don't know.

27:51.963 --> 27:53.862
He just put me in this tractor
and he told me to drive here.

27:53.930 --> 27:56.894
He said if I got out of the
seat, it would trigger the bomb.

27:56.962 --> 28:00.194
And he didn't mention
any other plan to you.

28:00.262 --> 28:01.495
No, nothing.

28:01.563 --> 28:04.964
I mean, I knew that he was
even angrier than I was.

28:05.032 --> 28:07.066
But I never thought in a
million years he would...

28:10.470 --> 28:12.637
I'm a dead man.

28:14.739 --> 28:16.439
Can I speak to my wife?

28:16.507 --> 28:19.411
Yeah, yeah, I'll work on that for you.

28:20.747 --> 28:22.013
Sit tight, Harold, all right?

28:22.081 --> 28:24.015
I'll get back to you.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.418
You have to call off
the disrupter charge...

28:26.485 --> 28:28.520
Until we can figure out what's going on.

28:28.587 --> 28:29.921
Harold is just a pawn.

28:29.989 --> 28:31.155
The ira used to do the same thing.

28:31.223 --> 28:33.024
They'd coerce civilians
to do the work for 'em.

28:33.092 --> 28:34.259
There's nothing we can do for him now.

28:34.326 --> 28:36.494
He's still sitting on
a bomb we can't defuse.

28:36.562 --> 28:38.362
Hey, look, if he moves, call me back.

28:38.430 --> 28:40.531
Jackson just turned his phone on.

28:40.598 --> 28:43.032
We triangulated it to 15th and I street.

28:43.100 --> 28:46.200
Hey, that is right here,

28:46.267 --> 28:47.968
just outside the blast radius.

28:48.036 --> 28:49.369
That's also near the hotel...

28:49.437 --> 28:51.738
where Secretary Dobbins is
holding his economic summit.

28:51.806 --> 28:54.040
Ok, Jackson's credit
card was used to rent...

28:54.108 --> 28:56.175
a white box van 4 hours ago.

28:56.243 --> 28:57.309
All right, I'm headed over there now.

28:57.377 --> 28:59.244
Remind me what this guy looks like?

28:59.312 --> 29:00.912
Let's get that out to all units.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.614
Yeah, but he's not gonna
look like that, is he?

29:02.682 --> 29:05.016
I mean, he's probably gonna
be disguised or something.

29:05.084 --> 29:06.817
You need to look for the posture...

29:06.885 --> 29:09.653
and the gaze of a... terrorist.

29:09.721 --> 29:11.021
Why am I telling you this?

29:11.089 --> 29:13.056
Why don't you just come with me?

29:27.859 --> 29:30.961
Take a look at that...
white box van, no plates.

29:37.168 --> 29:38.368
Suspension's maxed out.

29:38.436 --> 29:40.136
Yeah.

29:40.204 --> 29:43.238
So the terrorists have
their own delivery vehicle.

29:43.306 --> 29:45.240
This takes me back.

29:45.307 --> 29:47.141
He's probably gonna want
to hide in plain sight...

29:47.209 --> 29:48.343
could be in that crowd over there.

29:48.410 --> 29:50.711
Yeah, so he can keep an eye on his van.

29:50.779 --> 29:52.179
Yeah, on the target.

29:52.247 --> 29:53.214
You know how it is.

29:54.316 --> 29:55.916
What happens if we spot him?

29:55.984 --> 29:57.017
That's the signal.

29:57.085 --> 29:58.785
All right.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.256
Yeah, give me the bomb squad.

30:42.264 --> 30:43.264
Hey, Jackson.

30:43.332 --> 30:45.733
We've got Harold's wife and son.

30:45.801 --> 30:47.268
They're safe.

30:47.336 --> 30:49.236
You got the wrong guy, pal.

30:49.304 --> 30:50.737
No, no. You're Ron Jackson, right?

30:50.805 --> 30:52.906
You've got a bomb in that
van back there, don't ya?

30:52.974 --> 30:55.241
Answer me.

30:55.309 --> 30:57.076
What about Harold's trailer?

30:57.144 --> 30:58.778
Is that just a decoy?

30:58.845 --> 31:01.047
Eh?

31:01.115 --> 31:02.949
Answer me!

31:16.298 --> 31:17.698
I know that's the trigger.

31:17.765 --> 31:20.767
Jackson, put the phone down!

31:20.835 --> 31:22.802
Put it down!

31:28.809 --> 31:30.775
FBI! FBI. FBI.

31:46.426 --> 31:50.261
All right, so you're all
officially songwriters now.

31:50.329 --> 31:53.263
Nice work, and I want to thank
Oscar for these great lyrics.

31:53.331 --> 31:54.464
My pleasure.

31:54.532 --> 31:56.199
All right, here we go.

31:56.266 --> 31:58.033
And, um, sing your part.

31:58.101 --> 32:00.235
Help me out, all right?

32:00.303 --> 32:01.469
Good.

32:35.471 --> 32:37.038
Here you go.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.421
Good work.

33:54.994 --> 33:56.294
Command post.

33:56.362 --> 33:57.361
Sir, we've got Jackson and the bomb.

33:57.429 --> 33:58.561
It's over.

33:58.628 --> 34:00.827
Things are about to get
wrapped up here, too.

34:00.895 --> 34:02.593
Did you get Howard
out of the tractor yet?

34:02.661 --> 34:05.528
I can't risk the lives
of my bomb techs on this.

34:05.596 --> 34:07.196
There's no telling
how many booby traps...

34:07.264 --> 34:08.697
There are in Harold's device.

34:08.764 --> 34:09.697
Boss, listen...

34:09.766 --> 34:12.033
look, Ben, you did a great job, ok?

34:12.101 --> 34:13.868
But we're proceeding. I'm sorry.

34:13.936 --> 34:16.003
If there are other
conspirators out there,

34:16.071 --> 34:17.371
they find out Jackson's dead,

34:17.438 --> 34:19.306
they'll push the
button on Harold's bomb.

34:21.576 --> 34:25.779
Hey, when I asked Jackson
about Harold's bomb, right,

34:25.847 --> 34:27.947
he was defensive. He was bluffing.

34:28.014 --> 34:31.016
Can you tell me with 100% certainty...

34:31.085 --> 34:33.520
That there's no bomb on
Harold Clark's trailer?

34:33.588 --> 34:36.023
Not yet. Give me time.

34:36.090 --> 34:38.225
We're out of time.

35:16.530 --> 35:17.563
Hello?

35:17.631 --> 35:19.565
Harold, we've got Jackson and Miller,

35:19.933 --> 35:21.834
and we took care of Jackson's bomb.

35:21.901 --> 35:23.635
How's my family?

35:23.703 --> 35:25.437
They're doing fine.

35:25.504 --> 35:28.640
Thank you... for saving them.

35:28.708 --> 35:31.343
I can't take credit for that,
but I'll pass on your thanks.

35:31.411 --> 35:34.380
The FBI still thinks you
have a bomb in your trailer,

35:34.448 --> 35:36.382
and they want to disrupt you
with an explosive device...

35:36.450 --> 35:39.351
that could kill you
in the process. Uh...

35:40.520 --> 35:42.153
I understand.

35:42.221 --> 35:44.289
Harold, did you ever see the bomb?

35:44.357 --> 35:46.794
Or were you just told
about a dead man switch?

35:46.862 --> 35:48.698
I heard the click of the switch.

35:48.766 --> 35:49.933
I never saw the bomb.

35:50.002 --> 35:52.336
Ron said that he would
call and tell me how...

35:52.404 --> 35:55.639
to diffuse it if I just
stalled you guys long enough.

35:55.707 --> 35:56.907
That's not good enough.

35:56.975 --> 35:59.276
Yeah, no, I get it.

35:59.344 --> 36:03.714
Look, they should go ahead
and do it, just to be sure.

36:03.781 --> 36:06.016
There are too many people
around here, and if there...

36:06.083 --> 36:08.385
is a bomb in my trailer...

36:08.452 --> 36:13.923
I'd rather die than live knowing
I may have killed other people.

36:13.991 --> 36:16.292
Yeah, we're not there yet.

36:16.359 --> 36:18.928
Please, just let me talk to my
wife before they do it, though.

36:18.995 --> 36:22.096
Please? So I can just say goodbye?

36:31.506 --> 36:33.840
Honey, I hope you can forgive me.

36:33.907 --> 36:35.373
What are you talking about?

36:36.809 --> 36:38.444
I love you.

36:38.511 --> 36:41.614
I have always loved you.

36:41.682 --> 36:43.383
And I want you to...

36:43.450 --> 36:46.252
I want you to give
Bobby a big hug for me.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.889
I want you to tell him that I am sorry.

36:48.956 --> 36:53.360
I've always been very proud to
have you as a husband, Harold.

36:58.233 --> 37:00.034
Let's do it.

37:01.571 --> 37:05.875
You know, you should leave
if you don't want to see this.

37:11.416 --> 37:12.784
It's about bloody time, Torres.

37:12.851 --> 37:14.586
I got it. It should be ready to pull up.

37:14.654 --> 37:16.388
All right.

37:16.456 --> 37:17.522
And?

37:17.590 --> 37:18.856
I think you're right.

37:18.924 --> 37:21.923
Is there a bomb in Harold's trailer?

37:21.991 --> 37:23.589
Yes, there is.

37:23.657 --> 37:25.455
Why should I believe you?

37:25.523 --> 37:27.256
Ron wanted to kill the
secretary of treasury...

37:27.323 --> 37:29.190
And all those money
men when they evacuated.

37:29.258 --> 37:30.991
Even if that didn't work,

37:31.059 --> 37:33.859
he was going to have Harold's bomb
blow just to get the message across.

37:33.927 --> 37:38.595
So, yeah, Harold's
got a bomb, all right.

37:38.663 --> 37:40.063
I mean, you see that, right?

37:40.130 --> 37:41.030
I see it.

37:41.098 --> 37:42.832
Right, he's lying through his teeth.

37:42.899 --> 37:45.667
I mean, their only hope
of collateral damage...

37:45.735 --> 37:48.236
Is if the FBI blows Harold up for 'em.

37:48.304 --> 37:50.137
I mean, you're the puppet now.

37:50.205 --> 37:52.506
No. I can't take that chance.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.307
Well, I bloody can.
I'm going to see Harold.

37:54.375 --> 37:55.975
Boss, I'm going to have to
go with Lightman on this one.

37:56.043 --> 37:58.278
I said no. I can't allow it.

37:58.345 --> 38:00.179
Look, you asked me to
make the call, right?

38:00.247 --> 38:01.380
Well, now, I'm making it.

38:01.448 --> 38:03.348
There is no bomb in that trailer.

38:03.416 --> 38:05.116
If you're wrong, it's your ass.

38:05.184 --> 38:08.286
Well, if I'm wrong, in 5 minutes,
I won't have an ass, will I?

38:08.353 --> 38:09.820
Are you telling me you're 100% sure?

38:09.888 --> 38:11.555
Yes.

38:11.623 --> 38:16.826
But... I'd clear the area, you know?

38:16.894 --> 38:19.096
Just in case I'm wrong.

38:52.263 --> 38:53.563
Hey, Harold.

38:58.536 --> 39:00.537
Hey, how ya doin'?

39:00.604 --> 39:03.807
I'm Cal Lightman. We
spoke on the phone earlier.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.744
You're safe now. You can come on down.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.047
Are you out of your mind?

39:09.115 --> 39:11.450
No, not right now, but,
in a couple of hours,

39:11.518 --> 39:14.487
I'm gonna be really very drunk.

39:14.555 --> 39:16.723
Well, what about the bomb?

39:16.790 --> 39:19.825
There is no bomb. It's safe.

39:19.893 --> 39:21.827
There's a bomb. I heard a click.

39:21.895 --> 39:26.098
Harold, this is probably your one and
only chance to walk away from this.

39:26.166 --> 39:29.267
So, if I were you, I'd
definitely step on down.

39:58.628 --> 39:59.828
Careful.

40:00.697 --> 40:01.964
Here, let me give you a hand.

40:02.032 --> 40:03.332
You're all right.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.634
There ya go.

40:08.071 --> 40:09.371
All right.

40:09.439 --> 40:13.005
Don't go near that one
because that one is a bomb.

40:28.818 --> 40:29.952
What are you doing?

40:30.020 --> 40:31.453
Hang on a minute.

40:50.801 --> 40:52.268
Good work.

40:52.336 --> 40:53.402
Nice work.

40:53.470 --> 40:54.670
No? Ok.

40:56.739 --> 40:58.005
I'm the one who stole Clyde.

40:58.073 --> 40:59.774
Oh, I know.

40:59.842 --> 41:03.877
He's a turtle and he doesn't
like being in the classroom...

41:03.945 --> 41:05.044
At night all by himself.

41:05.112 --> 41:07.946
I took him home so
he wouldn't be lonely.

41:08.013 --> 41:09.080
Ok.

41:09.147 --> 41:10.981
You know, I think that
Clyde probably likes...

41:11.048 --> 41:12.315
Being on his own at night.

41:12.383 --> 41:15.084
I think he enjoys the quiet.

41:15.152 --> 41:18.120
I say you bring him back into
school tomorrow, all right?

41:18.188 --> 41:19.456
To the classroom.

41:19.523 --> 41:21.125
But you sneak him back in.

41:21.193 --> 41:23.730
No one needs to know a thing.

41:26.135 --> 41:28.670
I think I should tell miss Angela.

41:28.737 --> 41:30.672
Really?

41:31.507 --> 41:33.275
Oh, good girl.

41:33.343 --> 41:35.512
I might have a job for you one day.

41:37.014 --> 41:38.882
All yours.

41:38.950 --> 41:40.250
Get out of here. Don't miss your bus.

41:40.318 --> 41:42.686
Go on, you guys. I'll be right there.

41:57.832 --> 42:00.132
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

42:03.136 --> 42:04.136
You all right?

42:05.805 --> 42:08.973
Um, anyone want a drink? Hmm?
