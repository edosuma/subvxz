That flower
seen as I went down

00:24.400 --> 00:26.320
- as I was coming up

00:26.360 --> 00:28.240
I couldn't see it

00:28.450 --> 00:31.870
FLOWERS OF A MOMENT by Ko Un

01:02.150 --> 01:03.940
Watch your step, Jin-woo!

01:19.250 --> 01:21.670
- They're selling the subsidiaries.
- I heard.

01:22.090 --> 01:25.050
Like that will do anything
to solve this mess.

01:25.260 --> 01:27.630
Half the management
already got sacked.

01:27.970 --> 01:29.680
You think we're next?

01:35.470 --> 01:37.270
ROUTER SECURITIES CORP.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.070
That's all you have to say?

01:49.450 --> 01:52.620
Give us an explanation
for this disaster!

01:54.370 --> 01:56.870
We were only following
company guidelines!

01:57.080 --> 01:59.370
Let's try to be rational here.

01:59.580 --> 02:03.130
What was the risk management
department doing?

02:03.670 --> 02:06.090
How could they sit around
and let this happen?

02:06.550 --> 02:08.590
What have you people
made us do?

02:08.590 --> 02:12.340
- You pressured us into this!
- That's ridiculous!

02:13.890 --> 02:16.140
How do you expect us to
repair the damages?

02:21.690 --> 02:23.690
Why aren't you going in, KANG?

02:24.980 --> 02:28.780
- The company has a plan...
- The president told me himself.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.360
That we won't file for bankruptcy.

02:31.990 --> 02:34.070
I assured my clients...

02:34.160 --> 02:37.790
- I know, I know.
- Even my friends and relatives...

02:37.870 --> 02:39.500
I've heard enough!

02:40.160 --> 02:42.370
I know you put in your own money
to rack up sales.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.290
We're doing everything we can.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.880
- It's 1.3 trillion dollars!
- Mr. KANG!

02:49.050 --> 02:50.550
What's gotten into you?

02:51.840 --> 02:54.140
Don't act like you didn't know.

02:54.680 --> 02:59.560
Are you suggesting we deliberately
tried to trick you brokers?

03:03.060 --> 03:06.270
You knew all along.
You just didn't believe it.

03:07.610 --> 03:09.650
I expected more from a
smart kid like you.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.450
STOCK FRAUD

04:03.790 --> 04:05.290
KANG Jae-hoon!

04:05.460 --> 04:10.920
My money made you head manager.
Step up and do something!

04:11.130 --> 04:12.050
Come on!

04:12.670 --> 04:14.760
Don't you have anything to say?

04:14.840 --> 04:19.390
- How are you gonna fix this?
- This is what you meant by "high yield"?

04:19.810 --> 04:21.310
Look, it's on the news!

04:21.810 --> 04:23.270
Turn up the volume.

ROUTER SECURITIES CEO INDICTED
FOR SELLING BAD LOANS

04:32.400 --> 04:34.150
Goddamn crooks!

04:38.530 --> 04:40.280
They tricked us all!

04:54.010 --> 04:55.670
You said it was safe.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.930
You said they wouldn't
file for bankruptcy.

05:00.140 --> 05:02.140
It was a scam, lady!

05:02.600 --> 05:04.600
I take full responsibility.

05:06.100 --> 05:11.320
You're the manager.
You can fix this, can't you?

05:12.190 --> 05:16.950
Help me, please.
I know you can.

05:17.990 --> 05:19.360
I apologize.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.290
On behalf of all our employees...

05:31.340 --> 05:32.380
Shut up!

05:33.340 --> 05:36.380
- Please, don't do this.
- The nerve of you...

05:38.840 --> 05:40.140
Spitting out excuses.

05:41.510 --> 05:42.760
Are you all right, sir?

06:16.170 --> 06:18.010
You've been taking
your medication?

06:19.090 --> 06:20.090
Yes.

06:20.970 --> 06:23.300
And how did you feel these
past two mornings?

06:24.300 --> 06:26.310
I'm just getting by.

06:58.550 --> 07:02.630
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDY
I MISS YOU

JIN-WOO AND I WILL GO A WEEK LATER.

08:14.210 --> 08:16.210
THAT'S OKAY, RIGHT?

08:34.059 --> 08:35.730
- Hi, honey.
- What's the matter?

08:36.059 --> 08:38.770
I'm just asking what you think.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.820
Don't ask me when you've
already decided.

08:42.730 --> 08:47.280
I'm waiting on some results
coming in next week and...

08:47.360 --> 08:50.240
Never mind.
Do what you have to do.

This stop is Bondi Junction.

19:45.730 --> 19:48.190
What's wrong, Chichi?
Come back!

22:40.200 --> 22:41.530
Welcome.

23:05.970 --> 23:07.180
Hello?

23:07.390 --> 23:08.520
Yeah.

23:08.850 --> 23:11.640
I waited for thirty minutes,
but no one came.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.270
I see.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.070
I'm at the restaurant in front of
Backpacker Inn.

23:16.690 --> 23:18.320
That's right.

23:18.780 --> 23:21.110
So you have the money ready?

23:21.900 --> 23:24.410
It's just my first time doing
private currency exchange.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.030
I have the money ready.

23:27.700 --> 23:28.790
Sure.

23:29.250 --> 23:30.580
Right now?

23:30.710 --> 23:34.250
Then I'll wait outside.
Okay.

24:20.550 --> 24:22.010
- Hey.
- Hello.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.480
I don't think we're understanding
each other very well.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.940
You need to sign in to access
your bank account.

24:38.440 --> 24:43.360
Then can't we meet again
when I can get online?

24:43.740 --> 24:49.530
But why would you wait when
we can get you online at my house?

24:50.330 --> 24:53.330
It's just that I expected you to be
bringing cash.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.540
Damn working holiday losers.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.500
Let's just go.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.790
Are you gonna do this or not?

25:01.420 --> 25:03.420
It's your decision.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.010
- Fine.
- Then get in.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.490
Hey.

25:25.320 --> 25:29.240
You two plan to keep this up,
without a valid visa?

25:31.200 --> 25:34.250
I'm not going back to Korea,
that's for sure.

25:34.330 --> 25:37.870
Don't you have any goals or dreams?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.540
Come on, man.

25:39.790 --> 25:43.170
Dreams are worth shit.
I'm here to enjoy life.

25:43.210 --> 25:46.920
Stop nagging us, jackass.

25:47.510 --> 25:51.680
You talk big for someone that
practically lives at the casino.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.770
- Excuse me?
- Big man with his extended visa.

25:55.430 --> 25:57.890
- Stop with that attitude!
- What?

25:58.020 --> 26:01.310
She didn't offend you, did she?

26:02.690 --> 26:06.070
In-ho isn't upset.
He was just born uptight.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.490
Have you lost your mind?

26:10.910 --> 26:13.200
Yeah, I think she has.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.240
Snap out of it.

26:16.330 --> 26:20.330
- She's fucking losing it.
- Get yourself together!

26:21.380 --> 26:23.040
He's freaking out too.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.460
- Come on, In-ho.
- Just shut her up.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.890
There's nothing but crap in her bag.

26:32.390 --> 26:35.640
- Broke-ass bitch.
- She must have a rich heart.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.770
How's that gonna help me, huh?

27:33.490 --> 27:36.080
Do you think you can walk?

27:37.120 --> 27:42.040
I just need to get to
that building up ahead.

28:08.190 --> 28:10.690
You're Korean, aren't you?

28:12.190 --> 28:14.360
My name is YOO Gin-ah.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.410
They call me Gina here.

28:20.290 --> 28:23.210
I was having a pretty bad day...

28:25.670 --> 28:28.000
Thank you for helping me.

30:25.870 --> 30:28.330
Install this on the inside,
but with no keyhole?

30:28.460 --> 30:32.080
We'll just use it to lock up
from the inside.

30:32.250 --> 30:36.210
- What for?
- No one can see the second lock.

30:36.510 --> 30:38.720
So no one besides us
can get inside.

30:38.880 --> 30:43.970
- What if Jin-woo locks it?
- Install it up beyond his reach.

30:45.510 --> 30:49.940
- Isn't this a bit much?
- I get scared when you're not home.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.560
It's a scary world out there.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.650
I know your name.
Chichi.

33:46.900 --> 33:53.160
SOO-JIN LEE
THE SYDNEY ORCHESTRA APPLICATION

34:00.670 --> 34:02.920
- You're really selling it?
- Yeah.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.590
You can just play it as a hobby.

34:06.720 --> 34:11.429
Working at something every day
is too exhausting.

35:26.960 --> 35:27.960
Australia?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.630
You said the States last time.

35:30.050 --> 35:35.100
It's in the same time zone and
they have better weather.

35:35.930 --> 35:38.140
Not to mention better exchange rates.

35:39.100 --> 35:42.310
- There's no time difference?
- Sydney is an hour faster.

35:43.560 --> 35:46.900
But Jin-woo will learn English
in kindergarten...

35:46.900 --> 35:47.690
Soo-jin!

35:47.770 --> 35:50.610
You and Jin-woo both need to
learn to speak English.

35:51.110 --> 35:56.160
People fluent in English are in a
whole other economic sector.

35:57.490 --> 36:00.450
- For how long?
- Let's start with two years.

36:00.750 --> 36:01.830
See you tonight.

36:03.580 --> 36:04.830
Mommy!

36:05.670 --> 36:07.590
Chichi is pooping!

36:18.600 --> 36:19.600
Where?

36:20.470 --> 36:24.390
Don't poop here again,
or I'll really punish you!

36:25.650 --> 36:29.150
Stop that!
You'll lose all your eyebrows!

36:41.240 --> 36:42.700
No, that's wrong.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.960
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for the beach?

36:53.170 --> 36:54.880
Just four more answers to go.

36:54.930 --> 36:56.550
But that's too many.

That's right. Kangaroo.

Keep going.
What else?

38:01.410 --> 38:02.410
Let's go.

38:04.370 --> 38:06.200
Be careful, Jin-woo!

38:23.430 --> 38:24.640
Jin-woo!

Careful!

40:26.800 --> 40:28.180
You know what they say?

40:28.260 --> 40:32.060
Peeling oranges for someone is caring,
but peeling shrimp is true love.

40:45.780 --> 40:46.950
Mister.

40:48.990 --> 40:53.200
- What are you doing here?
- I was meeting someone nearby.

40:54.120 --> 40:58.040
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes. Thank you.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.630
That's good.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.920
I normally wouldn't ask for
something like this...

41:03.920 --> 41:06.220
I'm sorry, but I...

41:07.720 --> 41:11.470
- There's nothing I can do here.
- Can't you help me once?

41:11.890 --> 41:15.020
I came here on working holiday
two years ago.

41:15.140 --> 41:18.060
I'm very sorry,
but I have to be going.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.900
You just have to go with me.

41:21.320 --> 41:25.400
I'm afraid to go alone...
And I don't know anyone.

41:27.360 --> 41:30.330
I can't go back to Korea
without that money.

41:30.950 --> 41:36.580
These people were supposed to
help me exchange Australian dollars...

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Why didn't you just go to
the bank?

41:39.790 --> 41:41.750
They offered me a better
exchange rate.

41:42.550 --> 41:46.010
It was 1,300 won when I came.
Now it's less than 900.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.050
How much were you changing?

41:50.890 --> 41:52.260
19,000 Australian dollars.

41:53.430 --> 41:58.560
- You just gave them all that money?
- No, I didn't give...

42:00.730 --> 42:02.110
They took it from you?

42:02.900 --> 42:03.900
Yes.

42:05.650 --> 42:10.160
I can't go to the police because
I've overstayed my visa.

42:12.490 --> 42:16.250
I'm sorry to say this,
but you won't get it back.

42:16.450 --> 42:21.210
But I saved that money for two years,
working ten hours a day.

42:21.460 --> 42:24.750
- Can't you please help me?
- I'm really sorry.

42:30.550 --> 42:32.720
Please help me, Mister!

42:51.990 --> 42:53.990
It was somewhere around here...

42:57.580 --> 43:00.750
I think we passed this street before.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.880
I should've checked the street name.

43:04.040 --> 43:06.500
I'm sorry.
I was so distraught.

43:07.380 --> 43:09.630
- You said their house was white?
- Yes.

43:45.750 --> 43:48.340
I get up at four in the morning.

43:50.170 --> 43:52.180
Then I wash up.

43:52.930 --> 43:54.970
I don't, really.

43:54.970 --> 43:57.470
I just go and get on the van.

43:58.890 --> 44:04.060
They drop us off at a farm
about thirty minutes away.

44:07.690 --> 44:09.480
Are you mad?

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
No, it's nothing.

44:22.460 --> 44:25.460
- Did I do something wrong?
- Not at all.

44:26.750 --> 44:29.840
It's not you, Gina.
I'm just having some issues.

44:37.140 --> 44:41.810
What does it mean if someone
starts looking for a job

44:41.810 --> 44:44.100
when their visa is expiring
in three months?

44:44.350 --> 44:48.940
They can get a new visa
and won't have to go back to Korea.

44:57.370 --> 45:03.370
I sent my wife and child here two years ago,
but I was never that curious.

45:05.580 --> 45:09.210
I just heard their voices
over the phone.

45:10.210 --> 45:13.260
Just assumed they were doing fine.

45:13.880 --> 45:14.760
Oh.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.510
So you're living apart?

45:22.430 --> 45:27.190
I don't know how their lives
have been here,

45:29.440 --> 45:32.110
and why she's suddenly
looking for a job.

45:42.540 --> 45:48.460
Should we pick up on the street
of that last house tomorrow?

45:48.790 --> 45:51.750
No, I'll look ahead of time.

45:51.750 --> 45:55.210
- I'll find the house first and...
- Can you go by yourself?

45:55.720 --> 45:56.760
Sure.

53:25.250 --> 53:26.670
Hi, Mr. Kim.

53:26.750 --> 53:29.170
It's Jin-woo's mom, Apartment 201.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.880
Yes, we're good.
I'm sorry to call so late.

53:35.050 --> 53:40.680
It's just that I can't seem to
reach my husband.

53:40.850 --> 53:43.220
Could you go up and check, please?

53:44.930 --> 53:47.770
Press 0-1-2-7 and star.

53:48.520 --> 53:49.610
0-1-2...

53:49.770 --> 53:51.900
2-7 and star.

53:52.150 --> 53:55.400
Yes, please. Thank you.

54:04.370 --> 54:06.410
Hello?
Anyone home?

55:45.510 --> 55:47.140
Why did you come
all the way here?

55:47.640 --> 55:48.930
Stop following me.

55:49.140 --> 55:51.140
Hurry back home!

56:11.830 --> 56:13.460
You're here so soon.

56:15.630 --> 56:17.920
- Did you find the house?
- I did.

56:18.130 --> 56:19.800
Where did he come from?

56:20.590 --> 56:22.260
What's your name?

56:22.550 --> 56:24.550
- It's Chichi.
- Chichi?

56:25.220 --> 56:27.930
You're so adorable, Chichi!

56:28.140 --> 56:30.060
- Shall we?
- Sure.

56:31.230 --> 56:36.020
Turns out we were going in the
opposite direction last night.

56:38.320 --> 56:41.610
You got into a car
at the restaurant, right?

56:41.990 --> 56:43.650
How did you know?

56:44.200 --> 56:46.490
I rode that car here.

56:48.200 --> 56:51.620
They didn't just take your money,
did they?

56:54.370 --> 56:56.290
How did you meet them?

56:57.250 --> 56:59.040
An online community.

56:59.710 --> 57:02.050
I trusted them because
they were Korean.

57:02.760 --> 57:05.130
They were on working holiday too.

57:08.220 --> 57:12.140
No one was home when I came by
this afternoon.

57:13.230 --> 57:15.190
It's this house.

57:18.610 --> 57:19.980
What's this?

57:22.990 --> 57:24.780
This wasn't here earlier.

57:36.710 --> 57:38.960
Hey! Excuse me!

57:44.670 --> 57:45.590
Open up!

57:50.350 --> 57:53.220
This can't be happening...

57:57.190 --> 57:59.190
Anybody in there?

58:01.940 --> 58:04.110
Hey!
Is anybody in there?

58:44.860 --> 58:50.070
If a deal is too good to be true,
it always is.

58:51.200 --> 58:58.040
I've never had any doubts in
the work that I do.

58:58.660 --> 59:04.840
But I got promoted by selling
bad loans to my clients.

59:05.630 --> 59:08.510
That's how I sent my wife and child here.

59:09.550 --> 59:14.890
But it cost me my entire fortune
and the trust of my clients.

59:15.760 --> 59:18.020
I lost my family and friends.

59:19.140 --> 59:21.440
And I lost myself in the end.

59:23.400 --> 59:27.610
When you get on the bus
at five in the morning,

59:31.660 --> 59:38.540
you realize that no one is poor
because they're lazy.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.000
That's true.

59:46.460 --> 59:54.260
I was so proud of all my success,
but it meant nothing in the end.

59:59.770 --> 01:00:05.770
Looks like I've come too far
to turn it all around.

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.580
See you later.

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.870
Wish me luck.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.130
JIN-WOO KANG
ACUTE PANCREATITIS

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:10.740
Son.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:15.160
- Are you okay, Son?
- It's really you, Dad?

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:50.030
Go to sleep, sweetie.

01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:07.680
APPLICATION FOR PERMANENT
RESIDENCY IN AUSTRALIA

01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:19.150
NAME OF APPLICANT
SOO-JIN LEE

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:23.450
FAMILY MEMBER
JAE-HOON KANG, JIN-WOO KANG

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:39.610
All I want is for you to be happy
every single day.

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:44.950
And Mommy...

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.580
I want her to be happy too.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.100
You were watching all along.

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:54.850
I saw Dad at the hospital yesterday.

01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:59.100
Let's skip school today and
stay at home with Mommy.

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:07.860
Maybe you dreamt of Daddy since
you're excited to go to Korea.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.160
You couldn't have seen Daddy.

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:16.910
But he asked me if I was okay.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.500
Gina.

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.000
Gina.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.970
- You have to come with me somewhere.
- Right now?

01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:36.100
Where?

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.770
I think it'd be better for you
to see for yourself.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.400
Jin-woo.

01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:49.110
How many days are in a month?

01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:53.820
That's how long we'll stay in Korea
when we go next week.

01:16:56.490 --> 01:16:59.830
But if Mommy passes her audition,

01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:03.660
then we're gonna ask Daddy
to come live with us.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.250
- Would you like that?
- Yeah!

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:09.960
But Mommy...

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.600
Isn't this the same neighborhood?

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.100
What's going on?

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:29.980
Gina.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.360
Gina.

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:11.850
Tell them I didn't do it!

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.770
Just shut up!

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.570
CALLING HUSBAND

01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:53.580
Hi, Mr. Kim.

01:21:53.950 --> 01:22:00.170
You said you tried pressing 0127
and it didn't work, right?

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:01.880
I see.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:07.930
I just want to double-check
something.

01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:13.850
You said the lock was disabled
but the door wouldn't open.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:22.940
I forgot to tell you about the lock
we installed on the inside of the door.

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.320
That's right.

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:29.070
I think there's someone inside.

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:11.820
2015 BEST SALES PERFORMANCE
HEAD MANAGER KANG JAE-HOON

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:29.340
LEXAPRO, XANAX
KANG JAE-HOON, 2 TABLETS A DAY

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.510
Yes, Mr. Kim.

01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:17.180
What?

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.070
What are you talking about?

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:31.570
But how...

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.990
How could he...

01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:44.040
Jae-hoon.

01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:03.100
Male, forty-one.
KANG Jae-hoon.

01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:07.730
Looks like suicide caused by
prescription overdose.

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:11.440
Body kept in good condition
due to low room temperatures.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.530
We're transferring him to
the hospital now.

01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:18.830
You're really going to Tasmania?

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:22.040
Yes.
Would you like to come?

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:29.340
I don't think I'm ready
to let go yet.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.600
I thought it would be easier,
since it was my choice.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:45.600
But it just makes me more sad
and more angry.

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.860
It left me confused every time.

01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:58.660
I still can't believe it,
to be honest.

01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:05.120
I only came to terms with it
this morning.

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.290
It was hard to take in.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.010
Gina.

01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:27.230
Maybe we're just meant to
pass through,

01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:34.740
as quiet and unseen as
the way we first came.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.460
But why Tasmania?

01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:55.840
I lived life not even knowing it existed,
so I thought I'd go.

01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:05.060
My mom will come for me
if I wait here a while.

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.440
Bye, Chichi.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.830
Thank you, Mister.

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.050
I have to pee, Mommy.

01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:27.260
Okay, let's go.

01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.950
Wash your hands.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.110
Jin-woo.

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:47.400
How did Dad seem at the hospital?

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.990
What did he say to you?

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.780
But you don't believe me.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.700
No, I believe.

01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:56.790
Tell me what Dad said.

01:30:56.870 --> 01:31:00.580
He said he came to see
you and me.

01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:05.340
I can't really remember.

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:27.190
I wish you were here too, Dad.

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.320
But since you're not,
I'll show you instead.
