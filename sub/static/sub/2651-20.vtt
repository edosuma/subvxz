WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:05.152
And as we make our way
out of the gourmet kitchen,

00:05.240 --> 00:07.596
we find ourself back
in the warm embrace of the parlor.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.195
Easy, duchess. It's one
room, not Gosford Park.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.959
Where'd you get
all this sweet furniture?

00:12.040 --> 00:14.271
Oh, we rented it to make the house
feel more comfortable and inviting.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.919
Don't sit there! Oh, my gosh.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.799
It took me 20 minutes to get
these chops just right.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.560
Does that look straight? Nothin'
about that looks straight.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.996
- Mmm.
- I love the house. It's beautiful.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.271
Here is a tree.
It's a Pachira,

00:26.360 --> 00:28.829
a Taiwanese symbol
of good financial fortune.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.316
It's also known as a money tree.
That makes two of us.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.995
Well, I would like to propose a toast.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.470
Mmm. Missed me.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.995
To the hard work
of Claire and Cameron-

00:39.120 --> 00:41.237
or as I like to call
them, "Clameron." Oh!

00:41.320 --> 00:44.597
Which is what potential home buyers
will be doing when they see this place.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.160
Clamorin'.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.633
Clamoring t-to buy it f-
Phil, don't go back for it.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.554
Because this house
is going to sell.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.552
Who's the best Realtor in town?

00:55.680 --> 00:58.200
Gil Thorpe. That's right, and he
has buyers coming over tomorrow.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.311
- That's right.
- Wow! All right.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.073
To Claire and Cam.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.230
My sister. My partner.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.232
My sister! My partner!
My sister! My partner!

01:06.360 --> 01:08.397
Chinatown. Hilarious.
Still empty.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.709
You know you're my ride.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.950
To Clameron! Hear, hear!

01:11.040 --> 01:13.555
- Speech!
- Oh! Well, gosh.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.075
- I wasn't prepared for this.
- I think we should just really thank the people-

01:16.200 --> 01:18.112
Here's to the best construction
crew in the business. Okay.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.476
Hank. Luis. Paco!

01:20.600 --> 01:22.831
- Wish you could be here right now, buddy.
- What, did he die?

01:22.920 --> 01:25.754
No, he's on the roof fixing a shingle that
he should've gotten right the first time.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.071
- I guess the most important people-Yes.
- And then to my partner.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.913
- My lifelong companion.
- Aw.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.593
- My "lovah."
- Oh.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.672
- Okay, Cam.
- Who had his doubts about this project...

01:33.760 --> 01:35.319
the whole time...

01:35.400 --> 01:37.551
and never,
even in my darkest moment,

01:37.680 --> 01:39.239
said, "I told you so."
Oh.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.121
- Which is good, because he would've been wrong.
- Very gracious. Okay.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.595
And I'm sure that the house
is gonna sell in no time.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.956
Great.
Hear! Hear!

01:47.040 --> 01:49.077
Hey, I've got a friend
who wants to buy a house.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.992
Maybe I can show it to him
after school.

01:51.080 --> 01:54.198
Then if he buys it, I'd get the commission.
What would that be?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.431
- Adorable.
- I'm serious.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.557
I'm not adorable.
I'm getting a mustache.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.115
- Aw!
- Ay, qué lindo.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.271
I know my ABC's.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.636
I guess things weren't
about you for a second.

02:05.720 --> 02:09.316
- Okay. Wrapping this up.
- To the fastest sale in real estate history.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.560
Seriously, it's bad luck to toast
with an empty glass.

02:14.040 --> 02:14.788
♪ Hey, hey ♪

02:22.160 --> 02:23.480
♪ Hey♪ ♪

02:26.080 --> 02:27.878
Dunphy, I'm not gonna
lie to you.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.356
You guys did a nice job on the house.
My buyer wants in.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.319
Fantastic! That is great news!

02:33.400 --> 02:34.880
You know,
when we first got into this-

02:34.920 --> 02:37.515
Uh-Small talk's over. Here's
what we're prepared to offer.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.920
You're joking, right?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.480
I don't joke about real estate.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.359
I joke about golf and Mexicans.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.033
It's okay though.
I'm married to one.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.520
W-We're not gonna take this.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.273
It's first day on the market.
We'd barely break even.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.511
Take it.
No.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.711
The market's crashing!
Nuh-uh.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.757
- You're in over your head.
- Maybe you're in over your head.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.354
Dunphy, listen to me.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.511
If you pass up on this,
you're gonna regret it.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.638
I don't know the meaning
of the word "regret."

03:01.720 --> 03:04.440
Here we go.
French toast, double bacon.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.716
- Egg whites, dry toast.
- Damn it.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.593
Let me tell you something, Gil.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.239
You may be top dog,

03:10.320 --> 03:12.198
but you're the one
who's gonna have regrets...

03:12.280 --> 03:14.921
'cause this house is
gonna sell like... that.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.951
Oh. Well-

03:21.040 --> 03:22.520
That's it for today.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.273
We're going to die
in this house.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.397
Oh, the pillows
have lost their fluff.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.154
The pillows
are not the problem!

03:33.640 --> 03:35.438
It's okay, Manny.
I'll see you in a minute.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.911
Yes, I'll be polite
and I'll be nice. I promise.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.834
- I'm going to kill him.
- What'd Javier do this time?

03:41.920 --> 03:44.230
His one big weekend alone with his son,

03:44.320 --> 03:47.313
and I just found out
that he brought his latest bimbo along.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.153
He always does this.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.074
You remember that time that he took Manny
and that stripper fishing?

03:52.160 --> 03:54.516
Yeah. They barely got a nipple.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.195
- Come on. That was good. I just thought of that.
- Are you done?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.636
I bet she was comfortable with the pole.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.399
Ah. Should've quit after "nipple."

04:01.480 --> 04:02.960
How does Leno do it
night after night?

04:03.040 --> 04:05.714
I was just wondering that
about myself.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.874
Phil, please, tell us
that you have some good news.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.080
Well, it's complicated
because I don't have good news,

04:12.160 --> 04:13.680
but I really want you guys to like me.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.110
What? Gil Thorpe called
back with another offer,

04:16.200 --> 04:17.952
but it was 10,000 lower
than the last one.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.196
Lower?

04:19.320 --> 04:20.959
Oh, that is perfect.
That's just perfect.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.191
Something you wanna say,
Mitchell?

04:23.280 --> 04:26.079
Yes. "I told you so.
I warned you this would happen.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.157
I tried to stop it,
but you wouldn't let me.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.879
I was right,
and you were wrong.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.839
You live in this ridiculous
candy-colored fantasy land.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.556
I am so much smarter than you, and it is
killing me not to rub your nose in it!"

04:36.640 --> 04:38.120
No. I'm just thinking.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.873
Okay, guys,
we have to do something.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.872
We can't carry this house
for much longer.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.078
- Cam, what did you spend on staging?
- Uh, let's see. I don't know.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.480
How can you not know?

04:46.560 --> 04:49.394
Because I was hungry,
and everything was so pretty.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.113
And I didn't think it would matter...

04:51.200 --> 04:53.920
because who could've guessed
we wouldn't have sold the house by now?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.195
Me.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.112
Phil, do you think
you can get Gil Thorpe...

04:57.240 --> 04:59.232
up to his original offer?
How?

04:59.360 --> 05:02.194
I don't know. You could, uh,
flatter him, stroke his ego.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.710
No, he'd never fall for that.
He's too smart.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.271
- Oh. But, honey, if anybody can pull it off, you can.
- Mm-hmm.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.313
You're so good at everything.
Mmm. That is true.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.392
I'll do it.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.476
We're back!

05:17.560 --> 05:21.349
I cannot believe
that again you brought a girl.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.397
What is it this time?
A cocktail waitress?

05:23.520 --> 05:25.989
A boat show model? A stripper?

05:26.080 --> 05:29.312
No, then I could make real money.
I'm just a Ph.D.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.993
Mom, this is Trish.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.600
Gloria, hi.
Hey.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.949
Jay.
How do you do?

05:34.040 --> 05:35.997
I have heard so much about you.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.673
She works at the Museum of Art.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.991
It was so cool.
We got an after-hours tour,

05:40.080 --> 05:42.470
and Trish said I could take flash
pictures of the paintings.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.119
- But don't worry. I didn't.
- That's a relief.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.998
I was afraid I was gonna
have to look at 'em.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.680
So you work at the museum? Oh, no.
I'm just on the board.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.880
I run the art and antiquities
department at Christie's.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.118
Oh. Let me see. What is the
word I am looking for?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.714
Oh, yes-Bam!

05:55.800 --> 05:58.110
So how did you two meet?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.669
I won a car in a poker game,
but it caught on fire,

06:00.760 --> 06:02.319
so the guy gave me a painting.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.121
I took it to the auction house, y
"tiqui-tiqui," I made a big profit.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.874
But I still came home
with a masterpiece.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.189
He means her.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.035
May I tell you,
you have a wonderful boy?

06:13.120 --> 06:15.635
So well-mannered and chivalrous.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.599
It's like he leapt off the canvas
of a 16th-century portrait...

06:18.680 --> 06:20.956
by Gainsborough or Van Dyke.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.834
Listen to that brain. Hmm?
Can they stay for dinner?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.593
Well, that's up to them, papi.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.637
How can I turn down
a free meal?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.712
- First time's the hardest.
- What do you say, my love?

06:29.800 --> 06:32.634
Well, I'm not sure I'm ready to
say good-bye to this guy yet.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.394
But I'll only stay
if you let me contribute.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.757
I did bring along a fabulous bottle
of '82 Bordeaux...

06:38.840 --> 06:40.638
that we didn't get to
this weekend.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.200
For that, you can take Manny home.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.715
See what I have to put up with?

06:44.840 --> 06:48.595
Gil! Phil Dunphy.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.554
I knew you'd come slinking back!
Hey, guys!

06:51.680 --> 06:54.957
It's Dunphy. He's cavin'. What did I tell you?
What did I tell you, right?

06:55.040 --> 06:59.910
Oh, Dunphy, I
can play you like a ukulele,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.912
'cause you're small and dainty.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.878
Gil, I wanna talk to you
about your offer.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.599
Oh! I et me stop you
right there.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.672
This is how
this is gonna go down.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.594
First of all, I'm gonna take you
out to a very nice dinner.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.672
I'm gonna talk
really sweet to you.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.116
And then I'm gonna
lay you down by the fire-

07:15.200 --> 07:16.793
Oh.
Slow at first, then-

07:16.880 --> 07:19.315
If you guys are talking about the house,
my friend Zack's still looking.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.676
Honey, 14-year-olds
can't afford to buy houses.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.436
He's not 14. He's a software guy
who volunteers at my school.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.910
We 're gonna be sweating.
He's an adult with money?

07:28.040 --> 07:30.794
He drives a nicer car than you.
Get me his number right now!

07:30.880 --> 07:33.349
And then you're gonna go home and tell
everybody you went to the movies,

07:33.440 --> 07:36.638
but you and I both know
that you got Thorpedoed.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.798
Guess what, Gil. This was a courtesy call
to tell you that I have another buyer.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.237
So you can tell your buyer
that you cost them a great house...

07:43.320 --> 07:46.631
because you got cocky
and overplayed your hand.

07:46.720 --> 07:51.078
Prepare to Phil
the agony of Dunfeat.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.674
Both names!

07:57.400 --> 07:59.631
Now, I'm not
an art expert like you,

07:59.720 --> 08:01.598
but I did acquire
this piece in a gallery...

08:01.680 --> 08:03.797
in one of the finer
Vegas casinos.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.752
What do you think?

08:05.920 --> 08:09.072
It does say something. He used to,
before his little voice box broke.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.153
It said, "Welcome home, master.
Ruff day?"

08:12.280 --> 08:14.795
Again?

08:14.880 --> 08:16.997
Would you believe she made me
keep this in the attic?

08:17.080 --> 08:20.756
- Gloria, Trish says this is art.
- What was it Thoreau said?

08:20.840 --> 08:23.514
"It's not what you look at that matters.
It's what you see."

08:23.600 --> 08:25.432
Hear that?
You were wrong.

08:25.520 --> 08:29.594
Keep talking like that, and you will
find out how he lost his voice box.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.235
What have we here?
His name's Barkley.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.039
That's delightful.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.191
It's not delightful.
It's disgusting.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.510
Uh, look at Warhol.
Look at Koons.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.636
A lot of great works
of contemporary art...

08:40.720 --> 08:42.677
were initially dismissed as garbage.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.355
- Excellent point, Trish.
- This is not even garbage.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.399
They wouldn't take it.
It's too big for the can.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.200
Now, what I see is
a man who is not a man.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.476
He is a servant
who has lost his dignity.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.234
It is a commentary
on the class system in society,

08:56.320 --> 08:59.518
as well as a handy place
to put your keys and sunglasses.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.872
Whatever he is, your Barkley
is going back to the attic.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.237
- I'm going to see the baby.
- Oh! Barkley.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.118
- Very clever.
- Come on, guys. Let's play.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.759
What are you going to play?

09:09.840 --> 09:12.514
Charades. Me and Trish
against Dad and Jay.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.717
I have to warn you, Jay,
these two are very good.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.632
It's like they have
their own language.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.030
I want to play too!
Which team should I join?

09:19.200 --> 09:20.240
Play with Manny.
Oh, Jay's.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.475
Manny's team.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.956
Okay, then. Great.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.120
Well, we'll see you tonight.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.551
Zack Barbie is indeed an adult, he likes
the neighborhood, and he's interested.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.677
- Oh, thank God.
- Really?

09:32.840 --> 09:36.197
Did God come in here and tell you about him?
Because I don't remember it that way.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.919
Okay, okay. This is it, people.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.674
We cannot afford to lose this buyer.
Why am I standing?

09:40.760 --> 09:43.320
Phil, do you think
this is the right house for him?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.915
It's hard to tell. He's young. He's single.
I don't know anything else about him.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.560
Zack Barbie. Born 1986.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.199
Went to college
at a place called Mit.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.795
M.I.T.
I know how to spell it.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.111
Five words. It's a book.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.033
There's an old man...

09:58.120 --> 09:59.440
on the boat.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.911
He caught a big fish.
The Old Man and the Fish!

10:03.000 --> 10:04.798
- Time!
- The Old Man and the Sea!

10:04.880 --> 10:08.396
- Never heard about it.
- Hemingway's classic tale of man versus nature.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.320
Leave it to a guy with a hundred cats
to write a good fish story, right?

10:11.360 --> 10:12.999
Oh, Trish!

10:13.080 --> 10:16.551
What is this, a book club
or a fun game? Go.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.154
Oh.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.916
Play. Five words.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.720
Second word. Scared. Afraid.
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

10:27.800 --> 10:31.589
- Got it! You're amazing!
- Wowee! You could do this for a living.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.239
Really? There's such a thing?

10:33.360 --> 10:36.478
No, just like there's no such thing as
a professional Broadway enthusiast.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.236
- You're gonna have to get a real job.
- Okay, it's my turn.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.075
I don't know this.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.314
- I don't know this.
- Mom, you have to do the one you pick.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.995
Oh, no, Manny. It's fine. Just keep
picking until you get one you like.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.551
No, I don't have to keep picking.
I'm gonna do this one.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.398
Uh-oh.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.836
- No, I got this.
- Is it a play, a book or a movie?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.798
Yeah, one of those.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.439
Lost!
Clueless!

11:04.520 --> 11:08.070
- Dazed and Confused!
- This is stupid. Nobody can get this.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.470
You're probably right. I-

11:10.560 --> 11:12.995
Yeah. See? This is one of mine.
It's really hard.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.517
- Really? What is it? You do it.
- Well-

11:16.600 --> 11:18.637
Play.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.319
Sweeney Todd!
Exactly.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.756
What a team.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.117
This is a stupid-
game!

11:28.080 --> 11:30.231
Okay, so after a quick scan
of his Facebook, Twitter,

11:30.320 --> 11:32.835
Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram,
here is what I know.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.878
Privacy is dead?

11:34.960 --> 11:39.079
Likes: Chicago Blackhawks, kickboxing,
the movie Die Hard and beer.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.112
He sounds like a frat boy.
Oh, he's many things.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.271
He meditates.
He loves Indian food.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.033
And he's crazy
about his dog, Otis.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.873
- Does the house have a doggie door?
- No.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.952
Put one in. You get to Barbie
through Otis.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.640
She's like the girl with the dragon tattoo.
With cuter hair.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.598
Stop talking!
Oh, she really is.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.673
Dude has a thing for chicks in black
tights, he likes old-school funk,

11:56.760 --> 11:58.717
and he chipped his front tooth
playing soccer.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.393
Aw! That's actually kind of cute.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.960
Oh, my God.
You're falling in love with him.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.713
Oh, please.
It's just a job, nothing more.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.678
Okay. That's enough to go on.
Let's move.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.877
We've got two hours to turn that place
into Zack Barbie's dream house.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.354
Barbie's dream house.
We don't have time!

12:09.440 --> 12:10.600
Let's go. Let's go.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.640
What the hell
was all that about?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.951
Why don't you ask Trish?
She knows everything.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.759
Well, at least
she's not a bimbo.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.356
She and Manny seem to hit it off fine.
What's the problem?

12:25.440 --> 12:28.638
Just one weekend,
and he already idolizes her.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.758
And why wouldn't he?
She's so much smarter than me.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.719
She knows so much more about
the things that he loves.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.918
They have
their little inside jokes.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.799
If she learns how to froth his
cappuccino, I am history.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.395
You and Manny have the closest
relationship I've ever seen.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.871
Hell, he may never form a healthy
attachment with another woman after you.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.553
You're just saying that.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.359
And it doesn't matter
if Manny likes her.

12:50.440 --> 12:53.399
Knowing Javier's track record, he'll
dump her like he dumps everybody.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.200
You are wrong, Jay.
I'm not going to dump her.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.670
In fact, this weekend,
I asked Trish to marry me.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.318
You're going to marry her?

13:03.400 --> 13:05.312
I was waiting
for the right time to tell you.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.598
- Nailed it.
- I wanted to ask you for my abuela's ring back.

13:08.680 --> 13:12.674
I really want Trish to wear it. She is
the most amazing woman I've ever known.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.592
You see that I am
holding a knife.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.070
Please. Half our marriage
was you with a knife.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.516
Trish is the one.
And Manny already loves her.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.479
He can spend more time with us
now-holidays, summers even.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.438
Fine. I'll go
get you the ring.

13:24.520 --> 13:28.230
But you owe me eight dollars because
I had to replace "the emerald."

13:36.760 --> 13:42.870
Wow. Javier, you've brought a lot of 30-year-olds
around here, but this one's my favorite.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.957
And I like Trish too.
Me too.

13:45.040 --> 13:49.319
Then I suppose this is as good a
moment as any to tell you, Manny.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.198
Trish and I
are getting married.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.920
Oh, my gosh.
This is the best news ever!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.595
- Oh!
- Here. Drink.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.831
Now listen, my love.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.480
This belonged to my abuela.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.513
Um, maybe not now, Javier.
No, no. Please. Please.

14:04.600 --> 14:09.436
It will fill my heart to see
this ring on your-your finger.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.716
Oh. It's-It's a little small.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.355
I can't do this. No, no. I'll
just push a little harder.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.638
Javier, stop.
It'll never work.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.554
But wait, my love. We can
put butter on your finger.

14:22.240 --> 14:25.631
That's him. Hit it.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.714
Hey! Not him.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.473
Hey, guys. Sorry it took me so long.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.751
I've never bought beer before.
There's just so many choices.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.275
- Do we really need that much?
- I don't know. Is this a lot?

14:38.840 --> 14:40.035
Showtime!

14:42.000 --> 14:43.514
Hey! Not him.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.519
Hey! Thought I'd just swing by and
see how it's going. ♪ ♪

14:46.640 --> 14:48.871
Zack here? Oh, my God.

14:48.960 --> 14:52.715
You are wearing black tights.
Alex was right. You are into him.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.833
That skank Zoey broke his heart. I
can make him whole again! Haley!

14:55.960 --> 14:57.758
Okay, that has to be him.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.513
Everyone we know
is already here.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.235
Everyone, places. Let's
make this perfect. Yes.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.277
I'm Ira Glass.
Today on the program-

15:04.360 --> 15:05.635
No. Turn that off!

15:05.800 --> 15:07.040
No, no, no! Turn it off!

15:07.080 --> 15:08.514
It's the back button.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.954
...David Sedaris-

15:10.040 --> 15:12.714
Hey! You must be Zack.
I'm Phil Dunphy. Come on in.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.160
Hi.
Yeah.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.391
- These are my associates.
- Hello! Good evening.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.800
Hi!

15:17.880 --> 15:19.712
Oh, and my, uh-my daughter.

15:19.840 --> 15:23.470
So... this is the place.
Looks nice.

15:23.560 --> 15:27.031
- So, Zack, you hungry?
- Uh, no. But, uh, it smells great.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.158
Yeah, it's from this amazing
Indian place just down the road.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.760
It's walking distance.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.992
Which is awesome if you've had
one too many brewskis, am I right?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.430
Yeah.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.752
Oh, is someone a Blackhawks fan?
Love the Hawks.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.400
Yeah, well,
that's a weird coincidence.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.632
- Let's go check out the kickboxing gym.
- Seriously? I kickbox.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.274
What?
Yeah.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.000
Come on!

15:51.080 --> 15:52.673
Haley!

15:53.720 --> 15:55.359
Trish, open up!

15:55.440 --> 15:57.397
No. I don't want
to see you right now.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.597
Open up, or I'm going
to break down the door!

15:59.680 --> 16:02.115
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Don't break down the door!

16:02.200 --> 16:04.431
¡Ay, caramba! I'm beginning to think
I should've just bought a ring.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.591
Let me talk to her.
You?

16:06.680 --> 16:09.070
Yes. She's scared.
Maybe I can help.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.675
Help her go... adiós.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.514
Go ahead. And you tell her
she's being crazy and irrational.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.479
And if she doesn't come out,
I'm going to burn down this house!

16:17.560 --> 16:19.074
Don't burn down the house!

16:19.800 --> 16:22.634
Trish, open. It's Gloria.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.515
I'm sorry.
I needed to be alone.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.154
In Manny's bedroom?

16:28.240 --> 16:30.516
Well, I thought
it was a bathroom.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.751
It smells like potpourri.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.833
Listen, I would be
the first person to understand...

16:35.920 --> 16:39.197
that you're having second thoughts
about marrying Javier.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.920
I am, but I do love him.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.517
Of course you do, even though
he's irresponsible and impulsive,

16:46.600 --> 16:49.160
and if your sisters are even a
little bit pretty, he's gonna try-

16:49.240 --> 16:50.879
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not that.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.997
Is it the drinking?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.878
Is it the gambling?

16:54.960 --> 16:56.758
Is it because
of your fat fingers?

16:56.840 --> 16:58.354
- No, it's you.
- Me?

16:58.440 --> 17:00.079
How can I compete with you?

17:00.160 --> 17:03.597
All Manny talks about is how he's
got the world's greatest mom.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.830
And I know Javier
regrets losing you.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.873
- No, he doesn't.
- Oh, believe me, he does.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.034
And who could blame him?
I mean, look at you!

17:13.119 --> 17:15.031
Who has a body like that?

17:15.119 --> 17:18.032
And you just had a baby
two months ago?

17:18.119 --> 17:20.430
I mean,
do you just live at the gym?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.392
Who has time for the gym?

17:22.520 --> 17:24.159
Oh!

17:24.240 --> 17:25.878
You know what I had for lunch?

17:25.960 --> 17:29.954
I had a half a granola bar,
and I can't button my pants!

17:30.040 --> 17:31.872
I can't cook!

17:31.960 --> 17:35.476
And at best,
I am average in bed!

17:35.560 --> 17:38.234
And I will never,
ever, ever live up...

17:38.320 --> 17:41.597
to the great Gloria!

17:42.800 --> 17:45.474
Welcome to the family!

17:48.320 --> 17:50.596
And did I mention that
from the back of the garden,

17:50.680 --> 17:53.832
you can almost see a piece of the
building that they shot Die Hard in?

17:53.920 --> 17:55.400
Wow!

17:55.480 --> 17:57.153
I like to sit
back there sometimes.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.550
It's a great place to gather
my thoughts and just-

17:59.720 --> 18:02.110
I don't know. Be in the now.
I meditate every day.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.836
Yippee-ki-yay! What are the odds?
Yeah.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.276
You know, this is probably not
gonna help my negotiating power,

18:08.360 --> 18:11.751
but I kinda can't believe
how perfect this house is.

18:11.840 --> 18:16.915
And how much is little Otis
gonna enjoy this doggie door?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.196
How do you... know
my dog's name?

18:19.280 --> 18:22.318
- I don't.
- Yeah, you do. You just said "Otis."

18:22.400 --> 18:23.914
No. No, no. He said,

18:24.040 --> 18:27.431
"Oh, dis doggie door would
be perfect for your dog."

18:27.520 --> 18:29.159
Should you own one.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.709
- That's not even close to what he just said.
- That's what I heard.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.476
We can do a very fast escrow and get you
in this house by the end of the month.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.950
Oh! Just in time
for your birthday!

18:38.040 --> 18:40.316
This is weird!
It's totally weird.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.676
Okay, the Blackhawks,
you know my birthday,

18:42.760 --> 18:44.638
and you know my dog's name.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.757
- You guys are freaking me out.
- Okay, wait a second.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.479
We poured our hearts
into this house,

18:48.560 --> 18:52.600
and we just wanted to show you what it
would be like if you were living here.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.194
Did we go a tiny bit overboard?

18:57.920 --> 19:00.480
Oh, my God!

19:00.560 --> 19:02.950
- Favorite song. Way to go.
- You take care.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.874
Can you even see
the Die Hard building from here?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.519
No.
Mm-mmm.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.956
- Okay.
- I'll be at Coachella too! I'll come find you!

19:10.040 --> 19:11.156
Honey! Haley!
Haley!

19:12.800 --> 19:15.360
Well, that's it.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.238
We're officially screwed.
Darn it.

19:17.320 --> 19:21.234
- It's okay, honey.
- No, it's not okay. I feel responsible.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.755
I dragged us all into this.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.675
The whole point was so that I could
make a little extra money...

19:27.760 --> 19:29.479
and contribute to the family,

19:29.560 --> 19:32.280
and instead,
I'm gonna end up costing us.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.274
I'm a failure.
Hey. Hey.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.035
No one could've predicted this.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.634
My bad.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.189
We'll find another buyer. This time,
we'll learn from our mistakes.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.839
I got it.

19:43.920 --> 19:47.755
- He's back!
- No. No, no, no! Stop! Stop. Stop.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.400
This is a great house.
It was built with integrity.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.711
We should sell it that way, okay?
No more tricks.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.672
Yeah.
Let's just be honest.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.070
No tricks.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.157
Hey, Dunphy.
Gil.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.476
Your office said you'd be over here.
Yeah, I am here.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.314
With my buyers.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.120
- What do you guys think?
- Oh, my God! This house is perfect.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.557
I especially love
the warm embrace of the parlor.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.717
It screams you.
No, it screams you, sweetie.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.991
- Oh, dis doggie door, Cam. Look.
- Oh!

20:15.080 --> 20:17.311
Damn it. Gays.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.312
They come to play.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.320
I'm busy, Gil. Don't accept any
offers without talking to me first.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.959
My buyer wants in, all right?

20:25.040 --> 20:27.157
I don't know. We're pretty
far down that road.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.118
All right.
We'll up the offer.

20:29.200 --> 20:33.558
Gil, let me tell you how
this is gonna go down.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.394
First, you're gonna
buy me a lovely dinner.

20:36.480 --> 20:40.759
No, that's not it. First, I'm
gonna buy you a lovely dinner.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.196
Then I'm gonna take you
in the back-

20:43.280 --> 20:44.873
It's gonna happen!
It's gonna happen!

20:45.000 --> 20:47.231
We're gonna sell the house.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.040
You see, Mitchell?
I told you so.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.112
Yeah!

20:56.240 --> 20:57.913
Oh.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.639
That's my wife.
I better take it.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.552
Hey, hey. Whoa, listen.
Whatever you do,

21:01.640 --> 21:03.313
don't tell her you're
playing golf on a weekday.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.914
You'll be doing dishes
all night.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.196
Good call. Thank you, my man.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.272
Hey, honey. What's up?

21:09.360 --> 21:10.919
Oh, not much.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.430
Just, uh, in a meeting.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.955
You know, working hard,
bringing home the bacon.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.599
No, he's not!
He's playing golf!

21:17.720 --> 21:19.393
No.
Fore!

21:19.480 --> 21:21.119
Nice putt!

21:21.200 --> 21:23.760
Why you lying to your wife,
Dunphy? Huh?

21:23.840 --> 21:25.672
Hey, he had a beer
at lunch too!

21:25.760 --> 21:27.274
What is wrong with you?

21:27.360 --> 21:30.671
You just got Thorpedoed!
Come back here.
