WEBVTT

00:05.750 --> 00:07.208
MY FLIGHT'S STILL ON TIME.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.500
SHOOT!
WHAT?

00:10.500 --> 00:13.458
TODAY IS THE LAST
DAY I CAN DROP
THAT WRITING CLASS.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.333
I THOUGHT YOU
LIKED THAT CLASS.
I DO.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.250
I MEAN, I LIKE IT AS
MUCH AS I CAN LIKE

00:17.250 --> 00:19.625
ANYTHING I'M GETTING
A "C" IN. CRUD.

00:19.625 --> 00:22.166
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
I CAN ENTERTAIN MYSELF
FOR AN HOUR.

00:22.166 --> 00:24.041
YOU SURE?

00:24.041 --> 00:25.250
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY,
I'M SURE.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.125
WHO ARE YOU CALLING NOW?

00:27.125 --> 00:30.917
MYSELF. YOU HAVE
ONE NEW MESSAGE.

00:31.917 --> 00:34.667
IT'S FROM YOU FROM FRIDAY.

00:34.667 --> 00:35.667
DID YOU CALL ME ON FRIDAY?

00:35.667 --> 00:37.458
YOU DIDN'T GET
MY MESSAGE?
NO.

00:37.458 --> 00:38.333
YOU SOUND A LITTLE DRUNK.

00:38.333 --> 00:41.291
DAWSON, THAT'S
BECAUSE I AM DRUNK.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.917
NOW, GIVE ME THE PHONE.
WHY?

00:42.917 --> 00:44.208
DRUNK PEOPLE SHOULD
HAVE THE RIGHT

00:44.208 --> 00:46.083
TO NEUTRALIZE
THEIR OWN MESSAGES.
COME ON.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.542
NO WAY.

00:47.542 --> 00:49.208
OK, SOME GUY HIT ON YOU.
A NICE GUY.

00:49.208 --> 00:50.375
YEAH, SO NICE HE PROCEEDED
TO SLEEP WITH AUDREY.

00:50.375 --> 00:53.542
COME ON. DAWSON, COME ON.
GIVE ME THE PHONE!

00:53.542 --> 00:55.083
STOP! LET ME LISTEN.

01:18.083 --> 01:20.959
APPARENTLY,
I'VE GOT GREAT TIMING.

01:20.959 --> 01:22.708
DAWSON...

01:22.708 --> 01:23.834
I WAS DRUNK.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.208
I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER HALF
OF WHAT I SAID.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.750
WELL, THE GIST OF IT
WAS GOOD-BYE.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.083
WHICH IS SOMETHING
I REALLY WISH I KNEW
BEFORE I GOT A PLANE

01:29.083 --> 01:31.625
AND FLEW 3,000 MILES
TO COME SEE YOU.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.458
WERE YOU EVER PLANNING
ON TELLING ME ABOUT THIS?

01:33.458 --> 01:36.166
WHY WOULD I BRING IT
UP IF YOU DIDN'T?

01:36.166 --> 01:38.750
IT WASN'T EXACTLY
ONE OF MY FINEST
MOMENTS. NO.

01:39.875 --> 01:40.750
I WAS MAD.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.750
ABOUT WHAT?

01:42.750 --> 01:45.250
I DON'T KNOW.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.917
MAD THAT YOU WEREN'T
COMING TO VISIT ME,

01:47.917 --> 01:49.583
MAD THAT...

01:49.583 --> 01:52.375
WE HAVEN'T RESOLVED
ANYTHING.

01:52.375 --> 01:54.417
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING
WAS RESOLVED.

01:54.417 --> 01:56.083
I MEAN, UNTIL I GOT
THAT MESSAGE,

01:56.083 --> 01:58.000
I THOUGHT THAT WE SAID
EVERYTHING WE NEEDED
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER

01:58.000 --> 01:59.959
3 MONTHS AGO IN MY ROOM.

02:01.458 --> 02:03.333
GREAT. THEN I GUESS WE
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
LEFT TO SAY.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.333
JOEY...

02:04.333 --> 02:06.000
HEY, KIDS.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.750
UH-OH. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

02:07.750 --> 02:10.458
UH...

02:10.458 --> 02:13.208
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S
DAWSON'S LAST DAY,
AND I...

02:13.208 --> 02:14.875
I WANTED TO SHOW HIM
AROUND CAMPUS,

02:14.875 --> 02:15.875
BUT, I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE TIME NOW

02:15.875 --> 02:18.375
'CAUSE I HAVE TO
GO DROP A WRITING CLASS.

02:19.625 --> 02:20.667
WELL,
THAT'S A HEART-STOPPER.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.333
YOU KNOW...

02:22.333 --> 02:23.250
THEY DO HAVE THOSE
CAMPUS TOURS.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.583
THEY'RE A LITTLE
ON THE LAME SIDE,

02:25.583 --> 02:26.834
BUT NOT COMPLETELY
INTOLERABLE.

02:26.834 --> 02:27.834
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

02:27.834 --> 02:30.458
YEAH. PERFECT.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.083
GREAT. PROBLEM SOLVED.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.000
BYE.

02:37.417 --> 02:40.917
SHE'S A HANDFUL,
THAT GIRL, ISN'T SHE?

03:39.834 --> 03:41.250
Jen: HE IS NOT
GONNA CALL.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.333
Jack: HE'S CALLING.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.875
HE DOESN'T HAVE
MY PHONE NUMBER.

03:43.875 --> 03:44.917
HE WILL GET
YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

03:44.917 --> 03:45.667
HOW?

03:45.667 --> 03:46.875
SOMEHOW.
WHY DO YOU THINK

03:46.875 --> 03:48.500
WE'VE HAD ALL THESE ADVANCES
IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.625
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT
HELPING PEOPLE TRACK DOWN

03:50.625 --> 03:53.792
OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE
SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO.

03:53.792 --> 03:55.917
JEN, JUST TRUST ME,
ALL RIGHT?

03:55.917 --> 03:57.458
THE GUY WILL FIND YOU,
AND WHEN HE DOES,

03:57.458 --> 04:01.417
JUST HURL YOURSELF AT HIM
IMMEDIATELY, 'CAUSE YOU
OBVIOUSLY WANT TO.

04:01.417 --> 04:03.166
WHETHER I WANT
TO OR NOT,

04:03.166 --> 04:04.500
NICE GIRLS
DO NOT HURL
THEMSELVES

04:04.500 --> 04:05.542
AT BOYS, JACK.

04:05.542 --> 04:07.000
SOCIETY AT LARGE
DEEMS THAT SLUTTY

04:07.000 --> 04:07.959
AND
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.500
THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT, YOU'RE A SLUT.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.542
ONLY YOU HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY HAD SEX
WITH ANYBODY

04:12.542 --> 04:13.959
THE ENTIRE TIME
THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU.

04:13.959 --> 04:15.250
AND IF YOU LOOK
AT THE COLD HARD FACTS,

04:15.250 --> 04:17.959
I'VE KISSED MORE GUYS
THAN YOU HAVE THIS
PAST YEAR.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.500
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.959
I'VE KISSED ONE.
HOW MANY HAVE YOU KISSED?

04:22.959 --> 04:24.083
ONE.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.375
HOW MANY STRAIGHT GUYS?

04:28.208 --> 04:29.417
OK, NONE.

04:31.125 --> 04:33.750
THIS IS THE SADDEST
COMPETITION EVER.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.417
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
WE'RE IN COLLEGE NOW.

04:35.417 --> 04:38.708
NO ONE IS WATCHING,
AND NO ONE IS KEEPING TRACK.

04:38.708 --> 04:40.250
WHAT?

04:40.250 --> 04:40.458
I THINK WE'RE LOST.

04:43.041 --> 04:44.083
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:44.083 --> 04:45.417
ISN'T IT FAIRLY OBVIOUS?

04:45.417 --> 04:48.000
WOULD YOU MIND
BEING SUBTLE?
I WOULD REALLY

04:48.000 --> 04:49.375
RATHER NOT LOOK
LIKE FRESHMEN
DORKS WHO DON'T

04:49.375 --> 04:50.750
KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE GOING.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.750
JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING
WE'RE NEAR, ALL RIGHT?

04:53.750 --> 04:56.708
UH, WELL, THE RADIO
STATION IF...

04:58.625 --> 05:00.083
OH, MY GOD.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.667
JACK, JACK!
PUT THE MAP DOWN!
DOWN WITH THE MAP.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.792
HE'S GONNA THINK
THAT I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO FIND HIM.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.667
WELL, YOU ARE TRYING
TO FIND HIM.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.125
YOU SPENT THE ENTIRE
WEEKEND CIRCLING
EVERY CHARLES

05:08.125 --> 05:10.333
IN THE CAMPUS DIRECTORY.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.417
BUT HE DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW THAT.

05:12.417 --> 05:13.959
HI--HE'S WAVING.

05:13.959 --> 05:15.291
YES, YES, HE'S WAVING.

05:15.291 --> 05:16.708
SEE, I TOLD YOU
HE LIKES YOU.

05:18.834 --> 05:20.542
WELL, HOW MUCH MORE
OF A SIGN DO YOU NEED?

05:26.667 --> 05:28.792
IT'S UPSIDE DOWN.

05:28.792 --> 05:29.458
YOU'RE GOING IN ANYWAY.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.500
Professor Wilder: CAN'T YOU
DROP A DIFFERENT CLASS?

05:36.500 --> 05:39.542
SOMETHING USELESS, LIKE
BASKET WEAVING, OR, UH,

05:39.542 --> 05:40.500
WOMEN'S STUDIES?

05:40.500 --> 05:41.667
I'M GONNA PRETEND
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.667
I GOTTA SAY
I DID NOT SEE
THIS ONE COMING.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.333
I CAN USUALLY TELL
WITH THE ONES WHO DROP.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.166
THEY HAVE THIS FURTIVE,
GUILTY LOOK ABOUT THEM.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.125
NOT THAT THIS HAPPENS
TO ME A LOT, MIND YOU.

05:49.125 --> 05:50.500
PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY
DROP MY CLASS.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.291
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO KILL OTHER PEOPLE

05:51.291 --> 05:53.125
SIMPLY TO AUDIT MY CLASS.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.834
I KNOW.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.875
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
YOURSELF LUCKY
TO BE IN IT.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.500
I DON'T USUALLY
TAKE FRESHMEN.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.750
FRESHMEN HAVE
A TENDENCY TO FREAK OUT

06:00.750 --> 06:02.083
WHEN THEY SEE
HOW MUCH WORK
IS INVOLVED.

06:02.083 --> 06:05.792
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO YOU,
MISS POTTER, IS IT?

06:05.792 --> 06:07.583
YOU'RE NOT FREAKING
OUT, ARE YOU?

06:07.583 --> 06:09.625
NO. NOT EXACTLY.

06:09.625 --> 06:12.125
YOU DIDN'T FINISH
REWRITING THAT
STORY, DID YOU,

06:12.125 --> 06:13.667
ABOUT THE BOY
AND THE KISS?

06:13.667 --> 06:17.166
I TRIED. BELIEVE ME,
I TRIED.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.875
THINGS ARE REALLY
COMPLICATED AT THE MOMENT.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.208
OH, I SEE. MORE
COMPLICATED THAN
THEY WERE ON FRIDAY?

06:22.208 --> 06:23.333
YES.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.583
AND COMPLICATED IS BAD?
YES.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.375
SO, SOMETHING'S
CHANGED SINCE
FRIDAY?

06:26.375 --> 06:27.417
YES.

06:27.417 --> 06:28.542
YOU'VE CHANGED
SINCE FRIDAY?

06:28.542 --> 06:29.875
YES. NO.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.083
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.875
AND YET EVERYTHING
IS SUDDENLY MORE
COMPLICATED,

06:33.875 --> 06:36.583
AND YOU NEED
TO DROP MY CLASS.

06:37.917 --> 06:39.792
LOOK, I TOOK TOO MANY
CLASSES, OK?

06:39.792 --> 06:41.834
I...I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WANTED TO STUDY,

06:41.834 --> 06:43.667
AND YOUR CLASS
SOUNDED LIKE FUN.

06:43.667 --> 06:45.375
OH, IT IS FUN.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.875
9.4 IN LAST YEAR'S
COURSE GUIDE.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.000
I FULLY ADMIT
IT WAS A STUPID THING
TO DO, OK?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.083
I MEAN, YOU WARNED ME
ABOUT THE WORK INVOLVED,

06:52.083 --> 06:53.375
A LOT OF PEOPLE DID
AND...

06:53.375 --> 06:54.458
I GUESS I THOUGHT
I COULD HANDLE IT.

06:54.458 --> 06:58.750
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN'T?

06:58.750 --> 07:00.208
WELL, 'CAUSE I'M
OBVIOUSLY FREAKING OUT.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.542
GOOD POINT.

07:04.417 --> 07:08.000
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAPPENS,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.959
AND I LIED,
IT HAPPENS A LOT...

07:10.959 --> 07:13.750
IT STILL FEELS LIKE
GETTING DUMPED BY
YOUR FIRST GIRLFRIEND.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.834
HAVE A NICE LIFE,
MISS POTTER.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.500
SO, DAWSON,
YOU'RE NOT TOO HAPPY
TO BE STUCK WITH ME

07:31.500 --> 07:34.083
RIGHT NOW, ARE YOU?
NO, NOT AT ALL.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.417
YOU KNOW,
IT'S PROBABLY BEST

07:35.417 --> 07:36.667
THAT JOEY AND I
ARE APART RIGHT NOW.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.625
IF WE SPENT
THE WHOLE AFTERNOON
TOGETHER,

07:38.625 --> 07:41.625
WE'D JUST END UP
SAYING SOMETHING
WE'D REGRET.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.417
LIKE?

07:43.417 --> 07:45.708
LIKE WHY I'M LETTING
THIS GIRL RUIN
MY LIFE.

07:45.708 --> 07:47.166
HA-HA.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.959
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD
NOT BE DISCUSSING
THIS WITH YOU.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.959
NO, HEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

07:51.959 --> 07:53.125
I LIVE WITH THE GIRL.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.625
DO YOU EVER FIND
YOURSELF WONDERING
HOW SOMEBODY

07:54.625 --> 07:56.667
SO SMART
CAN BE SO...

07:56.667 --> 07:57.708
STUPID?

07:57.708 --> 07:59.333
EVERY DAY.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.166
OK. THIS IS IT!

08:01.166 --> 08:03.291
WHAT'S IT?

08:03.291 --> 08:05.083
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS WHERE
THE CAMPUS TOUR STARTS.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.792
THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.291
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT HAPPENS A LOT.

08:08.291 --> 08:11.333
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
THE CAMPUS TOUR ISN'T
ALL THAT INTERESTING.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.125
STILL, THE SHOW MUST GO ON,

08:13.125 --> 08:14.708
EVEN IF IT'S ONLY
FOR ONE PERSON.

08:14.708 --> 08:15.792
SO, UH, LET'S GO.

08:15.792 --> 08:16.792
WHERE?

08:16.792 --> 08:17.792
THE CAMPUS TOUR.

08:17.792 --> 08:18.792
BUT THERE'S NOBODY
HERE.

08:18.792 --> 08:20.834
BUT, SEE, THERE IS,
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE

08:20.834 --> 08:23.959
AND I'M HERE.

08:23.959 --> 08:25.542
YOU'RE THE TOUR GUIDE.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.458
BINGO!

08:27.458 --> 08:29.792
YOU CAN THANK ME LATER
FOR ROCKING YOUR WORLD.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.417
WELL, IT'S CHARLIE TODD HERE
PLAYING YOU ALL SORTS OF
OLD-SAD-BASTARD MUSIC

08:38.417 --> 08:41.207
AS WE DO EVERY MONDAY MORNING
HERE ON WBCW--

08:41.207 --> 08:42.707
ANYTHING WEEPY,
ANYTHING MOPEY,

08:42.707 --> 08:45.667
ANYTHING'S THAT'S EVEN
REMOTELY A BUMMER.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.000
LIKE, WE JUST HAD A REQUEST
FOR THE SMITHS CLASSIC

08:48.000 --> 08:49.708
GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA.

08:49.708 --> 08:52.291
SO, WE'RE JUST ABOUT
TO TRY TO GET THAT
ONE ON RIGHT NOW--

08:52.291 --> 08:54.125
YEAH, I'M SORRY, UH,

08:54.125 --> 08:55.542
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO PLAY THAT.

08:55.542 --> 08:57.708
THAT'S ON.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.500
OH, I KNOW.
I TURNED IT ON.

09:00.667 --> 09:02.708
MY NEW PRODUCER,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

09:02.708 --> 09:04.333
JEN...

09:04.333 --> 09:07.000
JEN "NOW WOULD BE THE PART
WHERE IT BECOMES PAINFULLY
OBVIOUS

09:07.000 --> 09:07.625
I DON'T KNOW HER LAST NAME."

09:07.625 --> 09:10.458
LINDLEY. JEN LINDLEY.

09:10.458 --> 09:11.834
APPALLING,
ISN'T IT, FOLKS?

09:11.834 --> 09:13.208
SO LIKE THE TALENT
TO FORGET THE NAMES

09:13.208 --> 09:14.875
OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
BEHIND THE SCENES.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.625
RIGHT. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.208
SO, YOU WERE ABOUT
TO TELL US ABOUT
A PROBLEM WITH

09:18.208 --> 09:19.417
GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.083
YEAH, WE'RE NOT GONNA
PLAY IT.

09:21.083 --> 09:24.375
UM, SEE THE PROBLEM
WITH COLLEGE RADIO
STATIONS--

09:24.375 --> 09:27.708
TOO MANY REQUESTS
FOR MISUNDERSTOOD
AMBISEXUAL GENIUSES.

09:27.708 --> 09:28.917
YOU'RE TOUGH.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.625
PEOPLE WANT TO BE LED.

09:30.625 --> 09:32.333
SO, CHARLIE, MR. DJ GUY,

09:32.333 --> 09:34.000
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND THIS RADIO THING?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.500
YOU LIKE
TALKING TO PEOPLE
WHO CAN'T TALK BACK?

09:36.500 --> 09:37.959
NO.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.500
I GUESS I JUST LIKE MUSIC.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.000
WELL, WHY ALL THIS
MOPE ROCK?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.750
WHY NOT RAP OR PUNK...

09:43.750 --> 09:45.083
OR THE RAMONES?

09:45.083 --> 09:48.458
WELL, JEN,
I GUESS I'VE LEARNED
IN MY VAST EXPERIENCE

09:48.458 --> 09:50.625
THAT PEOPLE TEND TO FEEL
PRETTY LOW ENERGY
MONDAY MORNINGS.

09:50.625 --> 09:52.542
HM, AND WHY IS THAT EXACTLY?

09:52.542 --> 09:55.458
WELL, BECAUSE THEY'VE GENERALLY
GONE OUT ON THE WEEKEND

09:55.458 --> 09:56.959
AND DONE SOMETHING
THEY REGRET.

09:56.959 --> 09:59.708
OR NOT DONE SOMETHING
THEY REGRET.

09:59.708 --> 10:02.291
IT IS POSSIBLE,
YOU'LL AGREE WITH ME HERE,

10:02.291 --> 10:05.375
TO FEEL MORE REGRETFUL
OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE

10:05.375 --> 10:06.708
THAN THE THINGS
YOU HAVE--LIKE, SAY,

10:06.708 --> 10:08.583
FAILING TO GET
SOMEBODY'S PHONE NUMBER

10:08.583 --> 10:10.166
THE FIRST TIME
YOU MEET THEM?

10:10.166 --> 10:11.291
WELL, JEN, YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.625
THAT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY.

10:13.625 --> 10:15.250
UNLESS THE GIRL--

10:15.250 --> 10:20.083
EXCUSE ME--WOMAN
INVOLVED HAD BLOWN
YOU OFF PRETTY MAJORLY

10:20.083 --> 10:21.500
AND APPARENTLY
HAD A BOYFRIEND.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.500
TALL, GOOD-LOOKING,
DARK HAIR...

10:24.500 --> 10:27.792
OH, I SEE. SO, WHAT
YOU'RE RUNNING HERE

10:27.792 --> 10:30.291
IS A RADIO PROGRAM
FOR MOPEY STRAIGHT GUYS

10:30.291 --> 10:31.375
WHO ARE
EASILY THREATENED
BY OBVIOUSLY GAY MEN

10:31.375 --> 10:34.041
IN ABERCROMBIE SWEATERS.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.917
FRANKLY, I DON'T SEE
HOW THE UNIVERSITY
CAN CONDONE

10:36.917 --> 10:38.333
THIS KIND OF BLATANT
NICHE MARKETING.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.542
I'M AFRAID THAT THINGS
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
CHANGE AROUND HERE.

10:40.542 --> 10:40.959
AND QUICK!

10:43.041 --> 10:44.500
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'RE GONNA
PLAY THAT SMITHS CLASSIC

10:44.500 --> 10:46.834
AND THEN A LITTLE SEDATED.

10:46.834 --> 10:46.959
WE'LL BE BACK.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.125
AND I AM DEFINITELY
KEEPING THIS ONE.

10:59.125 --> 11:02.458
PACEY. NO!

11:02.458 --> 11:03.291
WHAT? I NOT ALLOWED
TO KEEP A SOUVENIR
OF MY TRAVELS?

11:03.291 --> 11:05.291
NOT THIS ONE!

11:06.708 --> 11:08.708
YOU KNOW, I LOVE THE FRENCH.

11:08.708 --> 11:09.542
THEY COME DOWN
TO THE CARIBBEAN,

11:09.542 --> 11:10.792
THEY COLONIZE THE ISLANDS,

11:10.792 --> 11:13.000
THEY DESTROY ALL
OF THE INDIGENOUS CULTURES,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.208
AND WHAT DO THEY
REPLACE THEM WITH?

11:14.208 --> 11:15.375
TOPLESS BEACHES.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.500
THE BRITISH NEVER EVER
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.208
AND I AM KEEPING THIS ONE.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.708
FINE. YOU WIN.

11:20.708 --> 11:22.375
JUST DON'T LEAVE IT
ANYWHERE WHERE MY
UNCLE WOULD SEE IT.

11:22.375 --> 11:23.834
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

11:23.834 --> 11:25.792
YOU SEE, THIS IS
NO LONGER HIS BOAT.
IT IS NOW MINE.

11:25.792 --> 11:27.166
OH, RIGHT. I FORGOT.

11:27.166 --> 11:29.166
YES.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.333
I GOTTA GO.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.125
YOU GONNA MEET ME
LATER AT THE, UH--

11:35.125 --> 11:37.333
YES, I WILL.
BUT ONLY UNDER PROTEST.

11:37.333 --> 11:40.000
OH, SUE ME
FOR WANTING TO HAVE
ANOTHER MEAL

11:40.000 --> 11:41.583
WITH YOU
BESIDES BREAKFAST.

11:41.583 --> 11:42.917
AND WEAR
THE NEW SHIRT
I BOUGHT YOU, OK?

11:42.917 --> 11:44.375
YES, MA'AM.
OK.

11:57.875 --> 12:02.083
SO, THAT MUST BE THE, UH,
FAMOUS MELANIE.

12:02.083 --> 12:04.708
YES, INDEED,
MELANIE SHEA THOMPSON.

12:04.708 --> 12:05.875
TELL ME THIS, DOUGIE.

12:05.875 --> 12:09.041
WHY IS IT
THAT RICH PEOPLE
ALWAYS HAVE 3 NAMES?

12:09.041 --> 12:10.875
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.875
I GUESS THE MORE
PEOPLE YOU'RE
NAMED AFTER

12:12.875 --> 12:13.959
THE MORE WILLS
YOU CAN POTENTIALLY
APPEAR IN.

12:17.458 --> 12:20.333
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
PLANNING ON DOING
WITH YOUR LIFE, PACE?

12:20.333 --> 12:22.542
DOUGIE, COME ON.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.959
DOES THIS CONVERSATION
EVER GET MORE INTERESTING
FOR YOU,

12:24.959 --> 12:27.208
BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T
EVER GET MORE INTERESTING
FOR ME.

12:27.208 --> 12:28.500
WELL, IT'S BEEN, WHAT,

12:28.500 --> 12:30.542
3 OR 4 WEEKS SINCE
YOU GOT BACK FROM
THE CARIBBEAN?

12:30.542 --> 12:32.166
IT HAS BEEN 3 1/2 WEEKS.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.083
WHY? IS THE TAN
STARTING TO FADE?

12:34.083 --> 12:36.083
YOU PLANNING ON
STAYING IN BOSTON?

12:36.083 --> 12:39.125
JUST UNTIL THE NEXT
GIGANTIC YACHT NEEDS
A DECKHAND.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.125
SO, WHAT,
THIS WHOLE WAITING
ON THE RICH THING,

12:41.125 --> 12:42.250
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A PERMANENT PART
OF YOUR LIFE,

12:42.250 --> 12:44.166
IS THAT IT?

12:44.166 --> 12:46.083
NO, DOUGIE.
NOTHING'S PERMANENT.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.041
GOOD.

12:47.041 --> 12:50.166
THEN, HERE. I'VE GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

12:50.166 --> 12:52.125
WHAT'S THIS?

12:52.125 --> 12:53.708
A GUY I KNOW IN BOSTON.

12:53.708 --> 12:55.708
HE'S A CHEF.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.667
DOUG...

12:56.667 --> 12:59.250
I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT GETTING
A JOB

12:59.250 --> 13:00.250
AT SOME STUPID
RESTAURANT

13:00.250 --> 13:02.208
OR FOLDING SHIRTS
OR SELLING SHOES.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.041
I'M ONTO SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER
AND BETTER HERE,

13:04.041 --> 13:05.166
AND IT IS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

13:05.166 --> 13:07.000
BEFORE I GET BACK
OUT THERE.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.583
OH, YES, THE SEA.
I FORGOT...

13:08.583 --> 13:10.417
HERE I AM WITHOUT
MY OLD SPICE.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.458
LOOK, JUST GO SEE
THIS GUY, PACEY, OK?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.917
DO IT TODAY.

13:13.917 --> 13:16.166
I TOLD HIM THAT YOU
WERE GONNA COME BY
AND SEE HIM.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.083
SO, PLEASE,
JUST FOR ONCE,

13:18.083 --> 13:19.917
WILL YOU DO ME
THIS FAVOR, PLEASE?

13:19.917 --> 13:22.000
OK, OK. LOOK, IF I GO
SEE THIS GUY,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.166
WILL YOU GET OFF
MY CASE?

13:23.166 --> 13:26.041
NOTHING WOULD
MAKE ME HAPPIER,
LITTLE BROTHER.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.625
IS THIS THE LINE
TO DROP CLASSES?

13:57.625 --> 14:00.041
YEAH, THIS IS IT.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.792
Audrey: SO, DAWSON?

14:09.792 --> 14:10.959
YES.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.875
ANSWER THE QUESTION
THAT'S ON EVERYONE'S MIND.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.000
IS USC ALL IT'S
CRACKED UP TO BE?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.333
THAT'S THE QUESTION
ON EVERYBODY'S MIND?

14:17.333 --> 14:18.625
WHICH CIRCLES
ARE YOU
TRAVELING IN?

14:18.625 --> 14:19.959
OH, THE JEN-JACK-JOEY ONES.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.125
AH.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.208
AT LEAST PERIPHERALLY.

14:22.208 --> 14:23.166
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.792
I MEAN, I'M FROM L.A.
AND I HATE IT,

14:25.792 --> 14:27.959
SO I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT STRANGERS MUST THINK.

14:27.959 --> 14:29.291
IT'S...

14:29.291 --> 14:30.834
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY AWFUL.

14:30.834 --> 14:34.500
WELL, THAT'S
HIGH PRAISE.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.667
YOU KNOW SOMETHING...

14:36.667 --> 14:39.583
I BET THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE
FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL.

14:39.583 --> 14:40.875
WHO?

14:40.875 --> 14:42.083
KIRSTEN SMITH.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.708
OH, MY GOD.
YOU KNOW THAT GIRL?

14:43.708 --> 14:45.875
YES. IS SHE STILL WORKING
ON HER SHORT FILM

14:45.875 --> 14:47.208
ABOUT ACCOSTING
MINOR CELEBRITIES
IN PUBLIC WASHROOMS?

14:47.208 --> 14:49.000
OH, THAT'S NOT
A SHORT FILM
ANYMORE.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.125
SHE'S TRYING TO
EXPAND IT INTO
A FEATURE.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.291
UH!

14:52.291 --> 14:52.959
AND SHE CHANGED HER
NAME TO KIWI.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.125
NO LAST NAME. JUST KIWI.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.291
OH, GOD.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.542
I MEAN, I KNEW FILM SCHOOL
WOULD BE FULL OF POSERS.

14:58.542 --> 14:59.875
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
IT WOULD BE THIS BAD.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.708
[LAUGHS] BUT, I MEAN,

15:01.708 --> 15:04.834
YOU LIKE IT...

15:04.834 --> 15:07.208
LIKE, IN GENERAL.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.291
YEAH. WHY WOULDN'T I?

15:10.458 --> 15:12.333
I DON'T KNOW.

15:12.333 --> 15:15.875
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT,
GENERALLY PEOPLE
WHO LOVE COLLEGE

15:15.875 --> 15:18.375
DON'T FLY
ALL THE WAY ACROSS
THE COUNTRY TO SEE

15:18.375 --> 15:21.041
THEIR HIGH SCHOOL
FRIENDS IN OCTOBER.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.750
EVERYBODY GETS HOMESICK.

15:22.750 --> 15:23.542
WELL, YEAH,

15:23.542 --> 15:26.333
EXCEPT, THIS ISN'T
YOUR HOME.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.625
ALL OF MY FRIENDS
ARE HERE.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.875
YOU MEAN, JOEY.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.250
AND JACK AND JEN.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.917
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETIMES I THINK
IT'S A CURSE

15:33.917 --> 15:35.375
HAVING THESE GREAT FRIENDS
FROM HIGH SCHOOL, YOU KNOW?

15:35.375 --> 15:38.000
I MEAN, IF ALL YOU HAD
BACK HOME WAS 4 YEARS
OF UNABATED MISERY,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.291
YOU'D HAVE NOBODY TO MISS.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.583
EVERYBODY YOU MEET
WOULD BE A PLEASANT
SURPRISE

15:42.583 --> 15:43.917
AS OPPOSED TO A...

15:43.917 --> 15:45.667
TOTALLY HEINOUS LET-DOWN
COMPARED TO THE PEOPLE

15:45.667 --> 15:47.041
YOU ALREADY KNOW?

15:52.583 --> 15:54.083
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
DAWSON.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.625
THANK YOU.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.583
I'M GLAD SOMEBODY IS.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.458
TO REPEAT,
THE SPECIALS TODAY
ARE...

16:12.458 --> 16:15.792
STEAMED COCKLES,
RABBIT RAVIOLI IN
A BUTTER-SAGE SAUCE--

16:15.792 --> 16:18.750
DELISH. I LOVE BUNNY.
CAN WE GO NOW?

16:18.750 --> 16:20.708
SCATTER.

16:20.708 --> 16:22.500
AND PUSH THE FISH.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.250
ON MONDAY? DO YOU WANT US
TO KILL PEOPLE?

16:30.291 --> 16:31.959
SHE'S KIDDING.
THE FISH IS FINE.

16:31.959 --> 16:32.917
DO YOU EAT RABBIT?

16:32.917 --> 16:35.000
I'LL EAT ANYTHING
THAT'S FREE.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.708
HERE.

16:36.708 --> 16:37.917
THANKS.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.667
THAT'S NOT BAD.
ALL RIGHT.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.166
DON'T KID YOURSELF--
IT'S SPECTACULAR.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.166
I'VE NEVER EXACTLY
EATEN THUMPER BEFORE,

16:46.166 --> 16:48.708
SO I REALLY
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO JUDGE IT AGAINST.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.583
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
YOU THE NEW
DISHWASHER?

16:50.583 --> 16:51.333
[CHUCKLES] NO.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.917
I AM LOOKING
FOR THIS GUY.

16:53.917 --> 16:55.542
DANNY BRECHER.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.125
BRECHER.
YEAH, THAT'S ME.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.083
YOU'RE THE CHEF?

16:58.083 --> 16:59.000
I PREFER COOK,
BUT WHATEVER.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.667
THIS IS MY KITCHEN.
YOU'VE FOUND ME,

17:00.667 --> 17:01.875
SO, GO FOR IT, KID,

17:01.875 --> 17:04.375
BEFORE WE GET
SLAMMED IN HERE.

17:04.375 --> 17:07.916
WELL, I'M JUST HERE
AS KIND OF A FAVOR
TO MY BIG BROTHER.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.333
YOU'RE DOUGIE'S BROTHER?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.666
YEAH. PACEY. WITTER.

17:12.666 --> 17:14.333
THEN YOU ARE
NEW DISHWASHER.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.040
UH, NO. I'M A DECKHAND.

17:16.040 --> 17:20.333
I SPENT THE ENTIRE SUMMER
SAILING AROUND THE CARIBBEAN
ON A 48-FOOT YACHT.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.000
BUT YOU'VE NEVER WORKED
IN A KITCHEN BEFORE?

17:22.000 --> 17:22.916
NO.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.250
THEN YOU'RE
A DISHWASHER.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.583
NO, YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME.

17:25.583 --> 17:27.000
I'M JUST HERE AS A FAVOR
TO MY BIG BROTHER.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.333
IN FACT, IF YOU
COULD GIVE HIM A CALL
AND JUST LET HIM KNOW

17:29.333 --> 17:31.083
THAT I DROPPED BY,
I WOULD REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.125
MAYBE TELL HIM THAT YOU GAVE
THE JOB TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

17:33.125 --> 17:34.417
YEAH, YEAH,
HE TOLD ME
THAT YOU'D TRY THAT.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.583
HE ALSO SAID THAT
YOU JUST GRADUATED
HIGH SCHOOL,

17:36.583 --> 17:38.417
NO INTEREST
IN GOING TO COLLEGE.

17:38.417 --> 17:42.542
RIGHT. BECAUSE COLLEGE
IS THE ANSWER TO
EVERYBODY'S PROBLEMS.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.250
I APPRECIATE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE OFFERING ME
A JOB HERE, BUT,

17:44.250 --> 17:47.542
I TOLD YOU,
I ALREADY HAVE A JOB.

17:47.542 --> 17:48.959
HEY, WHATEVER
YOU SAY, POPEYE.

17:48.959 --> 17:49.875
I'M SURE THAT OUT
THERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE OCEAN

17:49.875 --> 17:52.000
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
THE BOMB.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.208
YEAH, I AM, ACTUALLY.

17:53.208 --> 17:56.041
OK, BUT RIGHT
IN HERE RIGHT NOW
IN THE KITCHEN,

17:56.041 --> 17:57.959
WHAT I NEED
IS A DISHWASHER.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.333
SO, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE THAT GUY,

17:59.333 --> 18:01.250
I SUGGEST YOU LEAVE,
BECAUSE
I LOOK AT YOU,

18:01.250 --> 18:02.959
AND YOU DON'T
LOOK LIKE SOMEONE
WHO NEEDS THIS JOB.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.041
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.

18:05.041 --> 18:06.834
WELL, THEN, I THINK
I DON'T NEED TO BE

18:06.834 --> 18:08.834
LOOKING AT YOU
ANYMORE.

18:11.667 --> 18:14.458
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A VINDICATION OF
THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN,

18:14.458 --> 18:16.375
SEXUAL POLITICS
BY KATE MILLETT,

18:16.375 --> 18:19.417
AND THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY
OF ALICE B. TOKLAS
BY GERTRUDE STEIN?

18:19.417 --> 18:21.333
IT'S KIND OF OVERKILL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

18:21.333 --> 18:23.417
I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT
IF YOU HAD JUST ONE.

18:23.417 --> 18:26.041
I HAPPEN TO BE TAKING
A FEMINIST LIT CLASS,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:26.041 --> 18:27.458
OH, SO YOU CAN
MEET WOMEN.

18:27.458 --> 18:30.083
YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYTHING
IS A CONSPIRACY.
SOME THINGS JUST ARE.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.542
LIKE ME BEING
UP HERE IN YOUR ROOM?

18:32.542 --> 18:34.667
NO, THAT IS
A CONSPIRACY
ON YOUR PART.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.083
YOU INVITED YOURSELF
HERE.

18:36.083 --> 18:39.583
ONLY TO SETTLE A BET
THAT WE HAD GOING
AT THE RADIO STATION.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.417
I'M TELLING YOU
I'M RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

18:41.417 --> 18:43.583
WHATEVER.
I'LL BELIEVE IT
WHEN I HEAR IT...

18:43.583 --> 18:44.792
IF YOU EVER OWN
THIS RECORD.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.083
IF.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.917
YES, IF. I JUST...
HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING

18:48.917 --> 18:50.750
THAT THE SAME PERSON
WHO OWNS LICENSE TO ILL

18:50.750 --> 18:54.667
ALSO HAS VOLUME 2 OF THE
ESSENTIAL DOLLY PARTON
COLLECTION.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.166
GIMME THAT.

18:56.166 --> 18:57.959
AND WHY IS IT
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU

18:57.959 --> 18:59.834
THAT I LISTEN
TO THIS SONG?

18:59.834 --> 19:02.208
BECAUSE...

19:02.208 --> 19:04.959
ONCE YOU HEAR
DOLLY PARTON'S
ORIGINAL 1974 RECORDING

19:04.959 --> 19:06.291
OF I WILL ALWAYS
LOVE YOU--

19:06.291 --> 19:08.417
A SONG LATER MADE
RE-POPULAR AND SUCKY
BY WHITNEY HOUSTON

19:08.417 --> 19:10.625
ON THE BODYGUARD
SOUNDTRACK--

19:10.625 --> 19:12.083
YOU WILL TRULY
UNDERSTAND

19:12.083 --> 19:14.000
FOR PERHAPS
THE FIRST TIME
IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

19:14.000 --> 19:16.458
WHAT IT MEANS
NOT TO SUCK.

19:16.458 --> 19:19.291
AND AT THAT POINT,
YOUR ENTIRE UNIVERSE
WILL TURN UPSIDE DOWN.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.625
AND EVERYTHING
THAT USED TO SEEM
WRONG TO YOU

19:22.625 --> 19:24.625
WILL SUDDENLY
SEEM RIGHT.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.959
IS THAT A GOOD THING?

19:25.959 --> 19:27.834
OF COURSE
IT'S A GOOD THING!

19:27.834 --> 19:28.917
WHAT IS MUSIC FOR

19:28.917 --> 19:32.834
IF NOT TO...SUBVERT
ALL YOUR EXPECTATIONS

19:32.834 --> 19:34.583
AND BLOW YOUR MIND
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

19:34.583 --> 19:37.750
WELL, I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
WERE FOR.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.917
WHAT?

19:40.917 --> 19:43.250
NOTHING. I--I--

19:43.250 --> 19:46.542
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU LIKE

19:46.542 --> 19:48.166
COUNTRY MUSIC.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.708
WELL, I LIKE
ALL KINDS OF MUSIC,

19:49.708 --> 19:52.667
UNLIKE YOU,
WHO'S OBVIOUSLY
VERY CYNICAL.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.417
AND CLOSE-MINDED...

19:54.417 --> 19:55.792
AND IS PROBABLY
ONE OF THOSE

19:55.792 --> 19:59.583
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS
KILL YOUR TELEVISION
FREE TIBET GIRLS

19:59.583 --> 20:02.667
WHO DRIVES AROUND TOWN
IN HER FATHER'S
OLD VOLVO.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.667
I--

20:07.667 --> 20:09.667
CAME HERE
FROM A SMALL TOWN.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.917
I LIKE TO KNIT,
AND I LIVE WITH
MY GRANDMOTHER.

20:11.917 --> 20:14.583
WORKS FOR ME.

20:23.417 --> 20:24.583
HI, IT'S ME.

20:24.583 --> 20:27.250
Dawson:
HEY. WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.375
WE?

20:28.375 --> 20:29.625
YEAH. AUDREY AND ME.

20:29.625 --> 20:32.041
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING THE TOUR.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.542
[CHUCKLES]
I AM, IN A WAY.

20:33.542 --> 20:36.417
WELL, LOOK, UM,
THIS WHOLE CLASS
DROPPING THING

20:36.417 --> 20:40.208
IS TAKING
A LITTLE LONGER
THAN I ANTICIPATED.

20:40.208 --> 20:41.875
THE LINE IS OUT OF CONTROL.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.667
SHE SAYS THE LINE
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

20:43.667 --> 20:47.250
YEAH, THAT'S A BUMMER.
HERE, LET ME TALK
TO HER.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.583
JOEY, HI.
THIS IS AUDREY.

20:48.583 --> 20:49.667
WE'RE GONNA
HANG UP NOW, OK?

20:49.667 --> 20:50.708
AUDREY?

20:52.750 --> 20:53.417
AUDREY--
HI!

20:54.834 --> 20:57.417
HI.

20:57.417 --> 20:58.708
HI.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.375
SO WHAT'D I MISS?

21:02.375 --> 21:04.417
WELL, I WENT
TO GO TAKE THE TOUR.

21:04.417 --> 21:06.500
TURNS OUT AUDREY
IS A TOUR GUIDE.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.834
AUDREY'S A TOUR GUIDE?

21:08.834 --> 21:10.125
YEAH. THE PAY SUCKS,

21:10.125 --> 21:12.208
BUT IT ALLOWS ME
TO COMBINE
2 OF MY PASSIONS--

21:12.208 --> 21:14.917
PERFORMING IN FRONT OF
SMALL BUT APPRECIATIVE
AUDIENCES,

21:14.917 --> 21:17.250
AND GETTING STRANGERS
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ME.

21:17.250 --> 21:20.083
AUDREY, DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU COULD--

21:20.083 --> 21:22.375
HOLD YOUR PLACE? SURE.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.708
HI.

21:24.708 --> 21:25.750
[SNICKERS]

21:27.583 --> 21:29.417
YOU SPENT THE ENTIRE
MORNING WITH HER?

21:29.417 --> 21:30.792
YEAH.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.917
I LIKE HER.
SHE'S A TRIP.
SHE'S EASY TO TALK TO.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.083
DAWSON, SHE'S JUST
FLIRTING WITH YOU.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.959
SHE FLIRTS
WITH EVERYBODY--
ANIMAL, VEGETABLE, MINERAL.

21:38.959 --> 21:40.583
I KNOW.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

21:44.834 --> 21:47.291
I'M--I'M SORRY
THAT THIS TAKING
SO LONG.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.458
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO HANG OUT WITH
JEN AND JACK.

21:49.458 --> 21:52.000
MAYBE WE SHOULD FINISH
THE CONVERSATION WE
STARTED THIS MORNING.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.959
WE HAD A GREAT WEEKEND.
WHY SPOIL IT WITH--

21:53.959 --> 21:55.542
WITH WHAT?

21:55.542 --> 21:57.875
WITH A LOT OF TALK
THAT ULTIMATELY
MEANS NOTHING.

21:57.875 --> 21:59.750
SO THE FUTURE
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP
MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.

21:59.750 --> 22:03.250
THE FUTURE. DAWSON,
YOU'RE GETTING ON A PLANE
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

22:03.250 --> 22:07.458
ALL I SAID IN MY MESSAGE
WAS EXACTLY WHAT YOU
TOLD ME BACK IN JUNE.

22:07.458 --> 22:10.291
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.
WE HAVE TO GO OUR
SEPARATE WAYS.

22:10.291 --> 22:12.583
ARE YOU A HUNDRED
PERCENT PREPARED
TO DO THAT?

22:17.291 --> 22:17.834
YOU KNOW,
I SHOULD JUST GO.

22:17.834 --> 22:20.792
[SIGHS]

22:20.792 --> 22:22.000
YEAH. YOU SHOULD.

22:29.166 --> 22:29.583
BYE.

22:41.208 --> 22:42.583
Woman: NEXT!

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
I NEED TO DROP
THIS CLASS.

22:48.542 --> 22:51.291
SORRY, SWEETIE.

22:51.291 --> 22:52.291
LAST I HEARD,
OSCAR WILDE

22:52.291 --> 22:54.000
DIDN'T TEACH HERE
AT WORTHINGTON.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.250
HE DIED IN 1900.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.583
HA. NO. IT'S NOT
WILDE. IT'S WILDER.
AS IN DAVID WILDER.

22:59.583 --> 23:01.583
I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SAY,

23:01.583 --> 23:04.750
BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY
WANT TO DROP THIS CLASS,

23:04.750 --> 23:06.667
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS BACK
AND GET IT SIGNED

23:06.667 --> 23:10.166
BY SOMEONE WHO'S
ACTUALLY ALIVE.
NEXT!

23:10.166 --> 23:12.959
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.917
I JUST WANT IT NOTED
FOR THE RECORD

23:21.917 --> 23:24.208
THAT THIS WAS NOT
MY IDEA OF FUN.

23:24.208 --> 23:27.250
FINE. YOU CAN
TORTURE ME WITH
GRILLED CHEESE TOMORROW.

23:27.250 --> 23:29.125
WHAT DO YOU
SUDDENLY HAVE AGAINST
NICE RESTAURANTS?

23:29.125 --> 23:32.083
NOTHING PER SE,
BUT I HATE PLACES
LIKE THIS.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.917
AND WHAT ELSE
WOULD YOU RATHER
BE DOING?

23:37.667 --> 23:39.375
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

23:39.375 --> 23:40.125
I HAVE TORTS
THIS AFTERNOON.

23:40.125 --> 23:42.250
[GROANS] OH...

23:42.250 --> 23:44.291
I DO HAVE A LIFE
BESIDES FROLICKING
WITH YOU.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.417
YEAH, I KNOW.
BUT YOU DON'T ENJOY IT.

23:46.417 --> 23:47.792
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

23:47.792 --> 23:49.583
BECAUSE NOBODY ENJOYS
LAW SCHOOL.

23:49.583 --> 23:51.834
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU DO TO MAKE
YOUR PARENTS HAPPY.

23:51.834 --> 23:52.917
THAT IS SO  NOT TRUE.

23:52.917 --> 23:54.959
REALLY? YOUR PARENTS
AREN'T HAPPY?

23:54.959 --> 23:56.917
NO. THEY'RE ECSTATIC.

23:56.917 --> 23:59.417
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY
LET ME CRUISE YOU
AROUND THE CARIBBEAN

23:59.417 --> 24:00.333
ALL SUMMER
ON MY UNCLE'S BOAT?

24:00.333 --> 24:02.667
THAT'S A VERY GOOD
POINT.

24:02.667 --> 24:03.959
NOW THAT I THINK
ABOUT IT,

24:03.959 --> 24:07.125
MAYBE MUMMY AND DADDY
AREN'T SUCH BAD FOLKS
AFTER ALL.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.708
SEE? NOW YOUR MOOD'S
IMPROVING.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.708
YES, IT IS.
WHICH IS WHY YOU AND I

24:10.708 --> 24:12.708
SHOULD GET OUTTA HERE
IMMEDIATELY.

24:12.708 --> 24:14.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:14.041 --> 24:15.125
I'M PAYING
THE CHECK.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.250
WHY?

24:16.250 --> 24:18.417
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE A JOB.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.125
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB
EITHER.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.250
NO. BUT I HAVE
A CREDIT CARD
AND AN ALLOWANCE

24:22.250 --> 24:22.750
AND A TRUST FUND.

24:25.625 --> 24:26.792
WHAT?

24:26.792 --> 24:29.000
YOU'D RATHER
PRETEND I DON'T?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.125
HA. OK.
GIVE THIS TO ME.

24:30.125 --> 24:31.208
NO!

24:31.208 --> 24:34.250
WHEN YOUR CHIP COMES IN,

24:34.250 --> 24:36.583
THEN YOU CAN TAKE ME
OUT FOR GUMBO
OR SOMETHING.

24:36.583 --> 24:39.166
BUT UNTIL THEN,
GET WITH THE TIMES.

24:39.166 --> 24:40.083
THIS IS WHAT
LEGALLY BLONDES DO

24:40.083 --> 24:42.000
FOR THEIR CUTE
SLACKER BOYFRIENDS.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.291
OH, GOD.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.375
OH...OH...OH...

25:00.375 --> 25:02.458
GOD! OH, MY GOD!

25:02.458 --> 25:04.250
WHAT'D I MISS?
HEY, WHAT'D I MISS?
ARE WE PRAYING?

25:04.250 --> 25:06.542
WHAT TIME IS IT?

25:06.542 --> 25:07.417
I DON'T KNOW.
5:00 SOMETHING.

25:07.417 --> 25:08.834
OH, SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT!

25:08.834 --> 25:12.333
HEY, HEY, WHY...
DID YOU LET ME
FALL ASLEEP?

25:12.333 --> 25:14.917
I WASN'T AWARE
WE WERE CONDUCTING
SOME SORT OF VIGIL.

25:14.917 --> 25:16.000
OH, GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DID THIS.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
DID WHAT?

25:18.000 --> 25:21.834
THIS! THIS, AFTER
EVERYTHING JACK AND I
TALKED ABOUT.

25:21.834 --> 25:23.667
WHO'S JACK?

25:23.667 --> 25:25.375
HE'S MY GAY BEST FRIEND.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.500
HAVE YOU NOT BEEN
LISTENING TO ME
THIS ENTIRE TIME?

25:27.500 --> 25:29.250
OH, GOD, MY SHOES.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.041
I NEED MY SHOES!

25:31.041 --> 25:34.083
LOOK, COULD YOU JUST
SLOW DOWN, PLEASE?
I'M NOT EVEN UP YET.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.166
LOOK, I'M LATE.
I'M VERY LATE.

25:36.166 --> 25:37.834
I HAVE TO GO TO DINNER.
I'M GONNA HAVE A VERY
UPSET GRANDMOTHER.

25:37.834 --> 25:40.250
I HAVE FRIENDS
COMING OVER.
I NEED A SHOE.

25:40.250 --> 25:41.250
YOUR GRANDMOTHER?

25:41.250 --> 25:43.667
YES. MY GRANDMOTHER.

25:43.667 --> 25:44.708
I LIVE WITH
MY GRANDMOTHER.

25:44.708 --> 25:47.000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
KIDDING ABOUT THAT.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.792
NO. UM...CAN I BORROW
YOUR SHOES?

25:51.166 --> 25:52.792
OH, GOD!

25:54.000 --> 25:56.125
HEY, COME ON,
COME ON, HOLD ON,
HOLD ON!

25:56.125 --> 25:59.500
HEY, COME ON, LOOK.
STOP. STOP. PLEASE
DON'T DO THIS.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.125
WHAT? DO WHAT?

26:01.125 --> 26:02.834
PRETEND THAT
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

26:02.834 --> 26:05.959
WHAT HAPPENED--
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

26:05.959 --> 26:07.375
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN.

26:07.375 --> 26:10.208
I MET YOU. I LIKED YOU.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.208
YOU LIKED ME.
WE HAD SEX.

26:12.208 --> 26:13.583
SO WE COULD JUST
TAKE A SECOND,

26:13.583 --> 26:16.708
STOP, AND APPRECIATE
THAT FACT,

26:16.708 --> 26:18.583
'CAUSE IT WAS A PRETTY
FRICKING AMAZING DAY
FOR ME.

26:18.583 --> 26:21.375
AND IF IT'S
ALL THE SAME TO YOU,

26:21.375 --> 26:24.375
I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO GO OUT
NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT

26:24.375 --> 26:26.458
AND START THE WHOLE
PROCESS OVER AGAIN

26:26.458 --> 26:27.542
WITH SOME GIRL
I'M NOT GONNA LIKE

26:27.542 --> 26:29.917
HALF AS MUCH
AS I LIKE YOU.

26:32.166 --> 26:33.917
OK.

26:33.917 --> 26:36.166
O-OK WHAT?

26:38.125 --> 26:40.458
OK. YOU CAN CALL ME.

26:40.458 --> 26:43.166
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO CALL YOU?

26:43.166 --> 26:44.083
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE.

26:44.083 --> 26:47.125
UH...MM--

26:47.125 --> 26:50.417
MM...MM!

26:58.750 --> 27:00.875
A LITTLE LIGHT
FOR A GRADE.

27:03.542 --> 27:05.333
THAT WASN'T FUNNY.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.250
OH, IT WAS
A LITTLE FUNNY.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.500
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO DO THAT TO ME.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.291
I WASTED MY ENTIRE
MORNING ON THAT LINE.

27:10.291 --> 27:11.625
I'M SURE YOU DID.

27:11.625 --> 27:14.083
AND MOST
OF THE AFTERNOON.

27:14.083 --> 27:15.959
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SIGN MY FORM,
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SO.

27:15.959 --> 27:19.625
AND MISS OUT ON ALL THE FUN
WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW?

27:19.625 --> 27:21.708
OK. NOT HAVING
ANY FUN. LOOK...

27:21.708 --> 27:24.250
TRUTH IS,
WHEN I ENCOUNTER THE RARE
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE

27:24.250 --> 27:28.125
WHO KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ITS, POSSESSIVE,
NO APOSTROPHE,

27:28.125 --> 27:30.291
AND IT'S, THE CONTRACTION
WITH APOSTROPHE,

27:30.291 --> 27:32.291
MY BLOOD TENDS TO RACE
A LITTLE BIT.

27:32.291 --> 27:33.959
SO, YES, I SENT YOU
ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

27:33.959 --> 27:36.667
BUT YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
FOR NOT WANTING
TO PART SO EASILY

27:36.667 --> 27:39.291
WITH A STUDENT
THAT I FOUND PROMISING.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.917
THAT'S NO EXCUSE
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

27:42.917 --> 27:44.959
YOU CAN'T COMPLIMENT
YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS.

27:44.959 --> 27:47.917
YOU FLUSTER VERY EASILY,
DON'T YOU, MISS POTTER?

27:47.917 --> 27:50.875
YOU HAVE THIS ALMOST
AMAZING INABILITY TO ROLL
WITH THE PUNCHES.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.667
IS MY PERSONALITY
BEING GRADED HERE?

27:52.667 --> 27:55.083
NO. IT'S JUST THAT
GENERALLY,

27:55.083 --> 27:57.417
COLLEGE REQUIRES
A LOT MORE JUGGLING
THAN IN HIGH SCHOOL.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.375
IT'S A LOT LESS
STRUCTURED AN ENVIRONMENT.

27:59.375 --> 28:01.208
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S NOT DANCE AROUND
THE ISSUE ANYMORE.

28:01.208 --> 28:04.792
YOU'RE GETTING A...
A "C" IN MY CLASS?
IS THAT CORRECT?

28:04.792 --> 28:05.834
CORRECT.

28:05.834 --> 28:07.000
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU WOULDN'T BE

28:07.000 --> 28:10.291
GOING THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE
TO DROP MY CLASS

28:10.291 --> 28:11.250
IF YOU WERE GETTING
SOMETHING OTHER THAN A "C."

28:11.250 --> 28:12.333
IS THAT CORRECT?

28:12.333 --> 28:14.458
NO. PROBABLY NOT.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.291
SO YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE

28:16.291 --> 28:18.125
WHO ONLY DOES THINGS
SHE CAN DO WELL.

28:18.125 --> 28:20.291
NO, ACTUALLY,
I DO A LOT OF THINGS
THAT I DON'T DO WELL.

28:20.291 --> 28:22.250
NAME ONE.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.750
THIS. I'M NOT
DOING THIS VERY WELL,

28:24.750 --> 28:26.375
BECAUSE DROPPING THIS CLASS
IS TAKING UP MY ENTIRE DAY,

28:26.375 --> 28:29.333
AND THAT BOY--THE ONE
WHO WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO COME AND VISIT ME--

28:29.333 --> 28:32.417
WELL, HE DID, AND NOW HE'S
OUT THERE DEBATING THE FUTURE
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP--

28:32.417 --> 28:35.250
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY,
I HAD ALREADY DETERMINED
HAD NO FUTURE,

28:35.250 --> 28:37.250
WITH MY ROOMMATE,
THE PROFESSIONAL MAN MAGNET--

28:37.250 --> 28:39.583
WHILE I SEEM TO BE STUCK
IN THIS ENDLESS LOOP WITH YOU.

28:39.583 --> 28:42.875
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LET ME
DROP THE CLASS, FINE.

28:42.875 --> 28:43.875
BUT I THINK I AT LEAST
DESERVE A STRAIGHT ANSWER.

28:49.542 --> 28:50.667
HERE.

28:50.667 --> 28:51.417
WHAT'S THIS?

28:51.417 --> 28:53.667
WRITE IT DOWN.

28:53.667 --> 28:56.208
BECAUSE WHAT YOU SAID
MADE ABSOLUTELY
NO SENSE.

28:56.208 --> 28:59.375
BUT IF YOU CAN MAKE SENSE
OF IT ON THE PAGE,

28:59.375 --> 29:01.875
THEN I'LL LET YOU GO
CHASE THIS BOY OF YOURS.

29:05.708 --> 29:08.625
YOU REALIZE
THAT THIS IS
COMPLETELY UNFAIR.

29:08.625 --> 29:10.500
I AM AWARE OF THAT. YES.

29:32.208 --> 29:35.208
IS THIS REALLY
WHERE PEOPLE GO
TO KILL THEMSELVES?

29:35.208 --> 29:37.458
YEP.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.792
USUALLY RIGHT BEFORE
THE LSATs.

29:39.792 --> 29:40.333
OR...

29:40.333 --> 29:43.750
YOU KNOW...

29:43.750 --> 29:45.625
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
JUST COME UP HERE
TO MAKE OUT.

29:45.625 --> 29:48.917
YOU WANNA? [LAUGHS]

29:50.708 --> 29:51.250
YEAH!

29:51.250 --> 29:52.417
NO!

29:52.417 --> 29:54.792
WHY NOT?

29:54.792 --> 29:57.166
BECAUSE...EVEN THOUGH
SHE WOULD PROBABLY
DENY IT

29:57.166 --> 29:59.500
WITH EVERY LAST
BREATH IN HER BODY...

29:59.500 --> 30:01.000
JOEY'S MY FRIEND.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.959
OR AT LEAST
SHE'S GOING TO BE.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.333
AND I DON'T THINK
SHE WOULD LIKE IT
TOO MUCH.

30:04.333 --> 30:08.959
OH, I WISH I COULD BE
HALF AS SURE OF THAT
AS YOU ARE.

30:08.959 --> 30:11.875
GOD, I LOVE THIS PLACE!

30:11.875 --> 30:15.542
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS!
THIS IS WHAT COLLEGE
IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.

30:15.542 --> 30:18.125
L.A. COULDN'T
LOOK LIKE THIS
IN A MILLION YEARS.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.458
BUT I FORGET.
YOU LIKE IT THERE.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.792
YES. I DO.

30:25.792 --> 30:28.458
WELL, AND THINGS
ARE GOING REALLY WELL
FOR YOU.

30:28.458 --> 30:31.375
I MEAN, YOU GOT
THAT INTERNSHIP
AT THE FILM COMPANY,

30:31.375 --> 30:32.458
AND YOU GOT
TO MEET TODD.

30:32.458 --> 30:34.125
YEAH, I DID.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.834
SO THAT'S NOT SO BAD
FOR A FIRST DAY,
YOU KNOW?

30:36.834 --> 30:38.834
THEN...YOU'LL PROBABLY
BE GOING BACK.

30:38.834 --> 30:40.417
OF COURSE
I'LL BE GOING BACK.

30:40.417 --> 30:43.667
WHAT AM I GONNA DO,
DROP OUT OF USC
AND MOVE TO BOSTON?

30:43.667 --> 30:44.708
THAT'D BE LIKE SCALING
THE HEIGHTS OF MOUNT LAME

30:44.708 --> 30:47.208
OR JUMPING OFF
THIS BELL TOWER.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.625
I MEANT THE JOB.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.959
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO THE JOB, RIGHT?

30:54.959 --> 30:57.834
RIGHT, THE JOB.
ACTUALLY, IT'S--I MUST
HAVE FORGOTTEN TO MENTION

30:57.834 --> 30:59.291
I ACTUALLY, UH...

30:59.291 --> 31:01.875
GOT FIRED
FROM THE JOB.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.375
SO...

31:04.375 --> 31:07.667
THAT'S ONE LESS THING
TYING YOU TO L.A.

31:12.041 --> 31:14.291
YEAH. ONE LESS THING.

31:42.708 --> 31:45.375
NOT BAD, MISS POTTER.

31:45.375 --> 31:48.166
THINK WE MAY HAVE
DISCOVERED YOUR
MAJOR FAILING

31:48.166 --> 31:49.041
IN BOTH LIFE AND ART.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.917
WHAT'S THAT?
OVER-THINKING THINGS.

31:51.917 --> 31:53.375
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES
RIGHT DOWN TO IT,

31:53.375 --> 31:55.041
YOU OBVIOUSLY
DO KNOW HOW TO SEPARATE

31:55.041 --> 31:56.417
WHAT MATTERS
FROM WHAT DOESN'T.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.834
YOU PROBABLY THINK
I'M WIMPING OUT
OR SOMETHING.

32:08.834 --> 32:10.500
NAW, I WOULDN'T
SAY THAT.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.041
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT

32:12.041 --> 32:14.208
I KNOW MY LIMITS,
AND I DON'T WANT
TO MESS UP

32:14.208 --> 32:16.291
THIS NEW LIFE
I'M TRYING TO START
FOR MYSELF

32:16.291 --> 32:17.917
BY TRYING TO DO
EVERYTHING AT ONCE.

32:17.917 --> 32:19.250
OF COURSE.

32:19.250 --> 32:21.959
I WAKE UP EVERY DAY,
I'M IN THIS BIZARRE
NEW ENVIRONMENT.

32:21.959 --> 32:23.959
I'M TOTALLY
AND COMPLETELY
ON MY OWN

32:23.959 --> 32:25.917
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE.

32:25.917 --> 32:28.041
SO...MAYBE I AM
A LITTLE AFRAID
OF GETTING A "C,"

32:28.041 --> 32:31.417
BUT IF I AM,
IT'S BECAUSE
A LOT OF PEOPLE

32:31.417 --> 32:35.375
HAVE MADE A LOT
OF SACRIFICES SO I COULD
GET TO THIS PLACE.

32:35.375 --> 32:38.542
YOU KNOW, MY SISTER,
MY FRIENDS,

32:38.542 --> 32:39.834
MY MOTHER...

32:39.834 --> 32:43.583
EVEN MY DAD
IN HIS OWN SCREWED UP,
NON-LAW-ABIDING WAY.

32:43.583 --> 32:45.208
SO...[LAUGHS]

32:45.208 --> 32:48.166
YOU KNOW...

32:48.166 --> 32:51.166
SOUNDS LIKE YOU
MAY HAVE HAD A LOT
OF INTERESTING STORIES

32:51.166 --> 32:52.583
LEFT TO TELL.

33:35.834 --> 33:36.792
BACK FOR
THE DINNER TASTING?

33:36.792 --> 33:39.166
IF I AM,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE

33:39.166 --> 33:41.000
THE FOOD
IS SO GREAT,
BELIEVE ME.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.125
GEE, I THINK I'LL WAIT
AND BE CRUSHED WHEN
FOOD AND WINE  STOPS BY.

33:43.125 --> 33:45.917
HOW DO YOU SLEEP
AT NIGHT CHARGING
PEOPLE

33:45.917 --> 33:47.667
25 BUCKS A HEAD
FOR THIS STUFF?

33:47.667 --> 33:49.708
REALLY, WHAT IS THIS--
IT'S A PORK CHOP
YOU'RE DRIZZLING

33:49.708 --> 33:51.083
JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF SAUCE ON, RIGHT?

33:51.083 --> 33:52.875
THEN YOU ADD ONE
OF THESE LITTLE FRENCH
FRIED POTATO THINGS

33:52.875 --> 33:54.792
INSTEAD OF MASHED POTATOES,
AND YOU'RE DONE, RIGHT?

33:54.792 --> 33:56.333
A GAUFRETTE POTATO.

33:56.333 --> 33:58.250
WHATEVER. ALL I KNOW
IS THAT LEON,

33:58.250 --> 34:00.417
THE CHEF ON THE BOAT
I WAS WORKING ON
THIS SUMMER,

34:00.417 --> 34:03.333
THE ONLY THING HE DID
TO SEPARATE THE FOOD
THAT HE SERVED US PEONS

34:03.333 --> 34:05.291
FROM THE FOOD
HE SERVED THE BOSSES

34:05.291 --> 34:06.875
WAS STACK THOSE UP
A LITTLE HIGHER AND ADD
ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

34:06.875 --> 34:10.792
INTERESTING. MOST CHEFS
DON'T SERVE THE GOOD STUFF
TO THE LITTLE PEOPLE.

34:10.792 --> 34:12.041
CUTS INTO THEIR
PROFIT MARGIN.

34:12.041 --> 34:15.250
LITTLE PEOPLE. I LIKE THAT.
SEE, LEON WAS GOOD PEOPLE.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.417
HE WAS PROBABLY
JUST ONE STEP AHEAD
OF THE AUTHORITIES,

34:17.417 --> 34:18.708
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO?

34:18.708 --> 34:20.291
YOU'LL FIND THAT A LOT
IN THE FOOD SERVICE
INDUSTRY.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.542
HOW DO YOU THINK
I KNOW YOUR BROTHER?

34:23.166 --> 34:26.542
MY WIFE'S PARENTS
HAVE A PLACE IN CAPESIDE.

34:26.542 --> 34:29.583
WHEN I'M NOT COOKING,
I TEND TO GET DRUNK A LOT

34:29.583 --> 34:31.375
AND HOWL AT THE MOON.

34:31.375 --> 34:32.708
THAT SURPRISE YOU?

34:32.708 --> 34:35.125
YEAH. I CAN'T BELIEVE
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY
MARRIED YOU.

34:35.125 --> 34:36.708
WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?

34:36.708 --> 34:39.000
YOU GOT A BETTER
SENSE OF HUMOR
THAN YOUR BROTHER DOES.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.958
NOT THAT I CAN
USE THAT AROUND HERE.

34:40.958 --> 34:42.375
UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN
THE ERROR OF YOUR WAYS.

34:42.375 --> 34:44.458
NO. ACTUALLY, I'VE SEEN
THE ERROR OF YOUR WAYS.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.833
SEE, YOU DON'T WANT ME
WASHING YOUR DISHES.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.000
I DON'T?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.667
NO, I'M MUCH TOO
VALUABLE A COMMODITY

34:49.667 --> 34:51.125
FOR THAT.

34:51.125 --> 34:53.125
I THOUGHT THAT WE'D
ALREADY ESTABLISHED
THAT YOUR SKILLS

34:53.125 --> 34:54.750
DIDN'T TRANSFER
TO DRY LAND.

34:54.750 --> 34:57.166
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE YOU
KNEW THAT I'VE CAUGHT,
CLEANED, AND COOKED

34:57.166 --> 34:57.792
JUST ABOUT EVERY FISH
IN THE WESTERN
HEMISPHERE.

34:57.792 --> 35:00.542
AND IF I CAN DO THAT,

35:00.542 --> 35:05.708
I'M PRETTY SURE I CAN
MASTER DICING TOMATOES
AND CHOPPING UP PARSLEY.

35:05.708 --> 35:07.291
SHOW UP ON TIME
EVERY DAY,

35:07.291 --> 35:09.125
WORK CLEAN...

35:09.125 --> 35:11.583
AND YOU CAN HAVE
PRETTY MUCH ANY JOB

35:11.583 --> 35:12.125
YOU WANT AROUND HERE.

35:12.125 --> 35:14.542
INCLUDING MINE.

35:15.750 --> 35:18.417
WELL, COOL, 'CAUSE,
YOU KNOW, AS FAR
AS I CAN TELL,

35:18.417 --> 35:20.291
YOU REALLY DON'T DO
MUCH AROUND HERE
ANYWAY.

35:20.291 --> 35:21.333
[CHUCKLES]

35:27.250 --> 35:29.375
[SHOUTING]
I SAID IN A SECOND!

35:29.375 --> 35:29.792
TAKE YOUR TIME.

35:29.792 --> 35:31.708
OH. HEY.

35:31.708 --> 35:33.125
NEW GUY.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.083
YEAH.

35:34.083 --> 35:36.375
DON'T LOOK SO SHOCKED.

35:36.375 --> 35:37.917
EVERYONE WHO WORKS
IN THE RESTAURANT
SMOKES.

35:37.917 --> 35:40.458
AND IF THEY DON'T,

35:40.458 --> 35:42.959
THEY USUALLY START
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
THE PEOPLE WHO DO

35:42.959 --> 35:45.458
ARE GETTING
10 TIMES THE NUMBER
OF BREAKS. YOU?

35:45.458 --> 35:47.625
UH, NO, THANKS.
THOSE THINGS'LL
KILL YA, YOU KNOW?

35:47.625 --> 35:49.250
YA THINK?

35:49.250 --> 35:51.291
DOESN'T MATTER,
ANYWAY.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.083
I PLAN TO QUIT SOON.

35:53.083 --> 35:55.166
THE JOB,
NOT THE CIGARETTES.

35:55.166 --> 35:57.417
IT'S THAT BAD, HUH?

35:57.417 --> 36:00.125
THIS PLACE?
IT'S AWFUL.

36:00.125 --> 36:02.542
BUT, YOU KNOW...

36:02.542 --> 36:05.834
PEOPLE ARE NICE.
AND I DON'T MEAN
THE CUSTOMERS.

36:05.834 --> 36:09.542
YEAH. THAT DANNY GUY
SEEMS PRETTY COOL,
I GUESS.

36:09.542 --> 36:10.708
HE THINKS
HE'S A ROCK STAR.

36:10.708 --> 36:14.708
THEY ALL DO.
EVERYONE WHO WORKS
IN THE KITCHEN.

36:14.708 --> 36:16.667
CHICKS DIG THEM
IN A BIG WAY.

36:16.667 --> 36:20.166
WHAT AM I TELLING YOU FOR?
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
YOU SHOWED UP HERE.

36:20.166 --> 36:22.333
AS IT TURNS OUT,
I'M KIND OF
A ONE-WOMAN MAN.

36:22.333 --> 36:24.000
PROVIDED
SHE'S THE RIGHT KIND.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.708
AND WHAT KIND IS THAT?

36:26.708 --> 36:29.041
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
THE KIND THAT
DOESN'T SMOKE.

36:29.041 --> 36:32.875
OUCH! YOU REALLY
KNOW HOW TO HURT
A GIRL.

36:38.959 --> 36:41.083
A MONTH AGO,
I WAS WATCHING
THIS SUNSET

36:41.083 --> 36:42.542
FROM THE DECK
OF A GIGANTIC YACHT

36:42.542 --> 36:43.959
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE CARIBBEAN.

36:43.959 --> 36:45.750
AND TODAY I'M...

36:45.750 --> 36:46.583
STUCK WORKING HERE.

36:46.583 --> 36:48.708
YEAH.

36:48.708 --> 36:51.959
YEAH, WELL,

36:51.959 --> 36:54.250
HERE'S NOT SO BAD,
REALLY.

36:54.250 --> 36:57.375
'CAUSE WHEN IT COMES
DOWN TO IT,

36:57.375 --> 36:59.917
WHAT MATTERS ISN'T
REALLY WHERE YOU ARE.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.542
IT'S WHO YOU'RE THERE
WITH.

37:03.834 --> 37:04.917
HERE.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.583
HOLD THESE FOR ME.

37:07.583 --> 37:10.333
AND TOMORROW
WHEN I ASK FOR THEM BACK,

37:10.333 --> 37:11.583
SAY NO.

37:11.583 --> 37:12.917
OH, YOU, UH...

37:12.917 --> 37:14.417
MIGHT WANNA
RETHINK THE SHIRT.

37:21.041 --> 37:22.208
HEY, WHERE'S--

37:22.208 --> 37:24.417
DAWSON?
YEAH.

37:24.417 --> 37:25.708
HE'S GONE.

37:25.708 --> 37:27.875
GONE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
GONE.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.041
I MEAN GONE.
HE LEFT.

37:30.041 --> 37:33.333
HE SAID THAT
HE WAS TIRED OF YOU
YANKING HIS CHAIN--

37:33.333 --> 37:36.166
OR, YOU KNOW,
NOT YANKING IT
AS THE CASE MAY BE--

37:36.166 --> 37:37.542
AND THAT, YOU KNOW,
HE WAS AN IDIOT

37:37.542 --> 37:38.917
TO HAVE WASTED
ALL HIS TIME
COMING TO VISIT YOU

37:38.917 --> 37:42.750
WHEN THERE ARE, LIKE,
A ZILLION PERFECTLY
NICE GIRLS AT USC

37:42.750 --> 37:44.708
WHO'D KILL TO GO OUT
WITH HIM.

37:44.708 --> 37:46.959
ARE YOU ON DRUGS?

37:46.959 --> 37:48.875
HEY, I SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY TRYING
TO DEFEND YOU.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.375
I SAID IT WAS A WOMAN'S
RIGHT TO BE MYSTERIOUS
AND DIFFICULT--

37:51.375 --> 37:53.375
YOU KNOW, THE GOOD ONES
ALWAYS ARE.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.041
APPARENTLY,
YOU AND I HAVE THAT
IN COMMON.

37:54.041 --> 37:55.417
BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

37:55.417 --> 37:58.458
HE SAID THAT HE WAS
GOING BACK TO CALI,

37:58.458 --> 37:59.625
AND HE WAS NEVER
COMING BACK,

37:59.625 --> 38:03.250
NO MATTER
HOW MANY PATHETIC,
DRUNKEN MESSAGES

38:03.250 --> 38:05.250
YOU ACCIDENTALLY
LEAVE ON HIS
ANSWERING MACHINE.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.291
OK. SO WHERE IS HE?

38:06.291 --> 38:07.875
WHERE ELSE?
HE'S AT THE AIRPORT!

38:09.417 --> 38:10.500
GO!

38:21.208 --> 38:23.291
THANK YOU, SIR.
YOU'RE ALL SET.

38:23.291 --> 38:24.375
THANK YOU.

38:24.375 --> 38:26.208
SO DID YOU GET TO SAY
GOODBYE TO JEN AND JACK?

38:26.208 --> 38:29.166
UH, YEAH, JACK,
AT LEAST.

38:29.166 --> 38:31.667
JEN WASN'T THERE
WHEN I STOPPED BY.

38:36.458 --> 38:38.250
MAN, IT MUST BE NICE.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.333
WHAT'S THAT?

38:39.333 --> 38:41.458
HAVING THEM AROUND
ALL THE TIME.

38:41.458 --> 38:42.542
YEAH, IT IS.

38:42.542 --> 38:45.750
AND EVEN THOUGH
IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S
HOUSE

38:45.750 --> 38:47.917
AND SOMEBODY ELSE'S
GRANDMOTHER,

38:47.917 --> 38:50.834
STILL IT'S LIKE HAVING
A SAFETY NET, I GUESS,

38:50.834 --> 38:52.875
OR...I DON'T KNOW, A...

38:52.875 --> 38:55.291
LIKE A FAMILY.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.667
YEAH.
LIKE A FAMILY.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.458
PUTS EVERYTHING
IN PERSPECTIVE.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.333
AND THAT HELPS YOU
SEPARATE WHAT...

39:06.333 --> 39:08.375
MATTERS
FROM WHAT DOESN'T.

39:08.375 --> 39:10.500
P.A. announcement:
THIS IS YOUR FINAL CALL.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.792
BOARDING ALL ROWS
AT GATE C3.

39:19.250 --> 39:21.125
AND WHAT DOES MATTER?

39:28.125 --> 39:28.542
YOU.

39:31.417 --> 39:33.333
THAT'S WHY I GOT UPSET
THIS MORNING, DAWSON.

39:33.333 --> 39:36.250
I HAD SPENT
THE ENTIRE WEEKEND

39:36.250 --> 39:39.750
THINKING THAT YOU HAD HEARD
EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY
ON THAT MESSAGE

39:39.750 --> 39:42.417
AND THAT YOU CAME ANYWAY,
THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD ME.

39:42.417 --> 39:45.291
JOEY, AS LONG AS I LIVE,
I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND YOU.

39:46.375 --> 39:48.959
I MEAN, I HAD THIS
FANTASTIC WEEKEND

39:48.959 --> 39:50.792
HANGING OUT WITH YOU,
MY FRIENDS, QUESTIONING
WHETHER OR NOT

39:50.792 --> 39:52.500
I EVEN WANTED
TO GO BACK TO L.A.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.417
AND THEN I WAKE UP
THIS MORNING TO FIND OUT

39:54.417 --> 39:57.708
THAT THE GIRL WHO WAS
SO UPSET WHEN I TOLD HER
I COULDN'T COME

39:57.708 --> 40:00.708
HAD ACTUALLY
KISSED ME OFF IN THE WANING
HOURS OF FRIDAY NIGHT.

40:00.708 --> 40:04.291
P.A. announcement:
ONCE AGAIN, FOLKS,
THAT'S FINAL CALL,

40:04.291 --> 40:05.959
GATE C3.

40:05.959 --> 40:08.041
DAWSON, I NEVER SAID
IT WASN'T CONFUSING.

40:08.041 --> 40:10.208
OK, THEN TELL ME
ONE THING YOU KNOW.

40:10.208 --> 40:13.375
I KNOW I WANTED YOU
THERE.

40:13.375 --> 40:15.291
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WHEN I GOT BACK
TO MY ROOM,

40:15.291 --> 40:16.375
I WANTED YOU THERE.

40:16.375 --> 40:17.375
WHY?

40:17.375 --> 40:19.041
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

40:19.041 --> 40:22.333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEANT.
I JUST KNOW THAT I
WANTED YOU THERE.

40:22.333 --> 40:23.542
[SIGHS] JOEY, I AM HERE.
I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR 2 DAYS,

40:23.542 --> 40:26.417
AND ONLY NOW ARE WE
FINDING A WAY

40:26.417 --> 40:27.417
TO TALK ABOUT STUFF
THAT REALLY MATTERS

40:27.417 --> 40:28.917
LIKE WHY YOU LEFT
THAT MESSAGE.

40:28.917 --> 40:32.417
AND MAYBE
THAT'S THE ENDING
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE.

40:32.417 --> 40:34.667
MAYBE EVERY OTHER
ATTRACTION WE FEEL
TO EACH OTHER

40:34.667 --> 40:35.625
IS JUST FEAR...

40:35.625 --> 40:38.917
FEAR OF MOVING ON,
FEAR OF GROWING UP.

40:38.917 --> 40:40.917
IS THAT WHAT
YOU REALLY THINK?

40:40.917 --> 40:41.959
I DON'T KNOW!

40:41.959 --> 40:44.041
BUT I DO KNOW
IF I GET ON THIS PLANE,

40:44.041 --> 40:45.291
I'M NEVER GONNA
FIND OUT.

40:45.291 --> 40:47.500
'CAUSE WE'RE
GONNA MOVE ON,
WE'RE GONNA GROW UP,

40:47.500 --> 40:50.417
AND 4 YEARS FROM NOW,
WE'RE GONNA WAKE UP

40:50.417 --> 40:51.834
AND BE COMPLETE
STRANGERS TO EACH OTHER,

40:51.834 --> 40:53.083
AND THE ONLY THING
I KNOW FOR SURE

40:53.083 --> 40:54.583
IS THAT I DON'T
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.125
DO YOU?

40:58.125 --> 41:00.333
Flight attendant: SIR?

41:00.333 --> 41:02.583
ARE YOU GETTING ON
THE PLANE, SIR?

41:02.583 --> 41:04.708
DO YOU WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN?

41:11.667 --> 41:14.000
NO.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.792
OF COURSE NOT.
