WEBVTT

00:12.931 --> 00:14.654
- Hey guys,
thanks for watchin' me.

00:14.655 --> 00:16.205
Okay, as you can see,

00:16.206 --> 00:19.689
I'm now playing
Llama Llama Spit Spit...

00:21.448 --> 00:23.447
A very cool game

00:23.448 --> 00:26.517
which, I guess was made
by some game company.

00:28.310 --> 00:29.999
- Pssst!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.447
It's made by us!

00:32.448 --> 00:36.482
- Oh...
Mystery solved.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.688
Apparently, this game
is made by Game Shakers...

00:40.689 --> 00:43.586
of which I myself am a part of,
including me.

00:44.862 --> 00:46.999
- Uh, are you sure we should be

00:47.000 --> 00:48.447
showing Hudson
to the whole world?

00:48.448 --> 00:50.481
- What are you talkin' about?

00:50.482 --> 00:52.447
Look, there's over
200,000 people,

00:52.448 --> 00:54.723
watching him play our game.

00:54.724 --> 00:56.136
- I know but...

00:56.137 --> 00:59.136
Sometimes the things he says
are embarrassing.

00:59.137 --> 01:01.895
- Now, I assume that a "Lah-mah"

01:01.896 --> 01:04.309
refers to girl llamas...

01:04.310 --> 01:07.241
and that a boy llama would
be called a "Lah-mo."

01:08.965 --> 01:10.447
- Hey, how we doin'?

01:10.448 --> 01:13.274
- Take a look.
240,000 people

01:13.275 --> 01:17.102
watching Hudson play, right now.

01:17.103 --> 01:19.447
- Uh, well, since Hudson
started Let's Playing...

01:19.448 --> 01:22.447
Llama Llama Spit Spit
has gone from number 47

01:22.448 --> 01:24.585
to number 2 on the chart.

01:24.586 --> 01:25.930
- Yeah-heh baby!
- Hey! Number two!

01:25.931 --> 01:27.757
- Wait wait wait wait...

01:27.758 --> 01:29.171
What's he doin' now?

01:29.172 --> 01:32.826
- Okay, as you can see,

01:32.827 --> 01:34.619
I'm now using my tongue

01:34.620 --> 01:37.102
to control the llama's
movements...

01:37.103 --> 01:40.378
- Hudson, just play the game
and quit licking the Pear Pad!

01:40.379 --> 01:42.481
- Shhh!!!
- STOP THAT!

01:42.482 --> 01:44.240
- Why do you care if he wants
to lick the Pear Pad?!?

01:44.241 --> 01:46.586
- They're not spit resistant!

01:48.206 --> 01:49.447
- Ooo.
Hey look...

01:49.448 --> 01:52.274
I got a loose thread
on my sweater.

01:52.275 --> 01:54.033
- Awww, now he's talkin'
about his sweater problems.

01:54.034 --> 01:55.585
- Who cares?

01:55.586 --> 01:57.930
- Yeah, I mean, our fans
like watchin' him,

01:57.931 --> 02:01.067
and that means
we sell more games.

02:01.068 --> 02:03.550
- Now, when you
have a loose thread,

02:03.551 --> 02:06.964
the best thing to do is:
yank on it.

02:06.965 --> 02:09.792
- Hudson!
- As you can see,

02:09.793 --> 02:13.171
this thread's getting
longer and longer.

02:16.793 --> 02:18.378
- What's up, Dad?

02:18.379 --> 02:20.033
- Hey Trip!
Guess where I am!

02:20.034 --> 02:22.102
- I don't know.
- Nope!

02:22.103 --> 02:25.171
I'm up in my helicopter!
Ha ha ha ha!

02:25.172 --> 02:27.136
- Aw, Dad, please tell me

02:27.137 --> 02:28.309
you're not wearin'
your wing suit!

02:28.310 --> 02:29.447
- Oh, is he gonna jump?!?

02:29.448 --> 02:31.102
- Tell him not to jump!

02:31.103 --> 02:32.895
- Dad, do not jump out
of your helicopter!

02:32.896 --> 02:35.516
- Okay!
Here I come!

02:35.517 --> 02:37.343
GERANIUMS!

02:37.344 --> 02:38.862
- Nooo!
- Ah, geez Louise man!

02:40.379 --> 02:42.688
- Look out your back window!
- What'd he say?

02:42.689 --> 02:46.033
- He said look out
the back window!

02:46.034 --> 02:50.757
- AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!

03:01.103 --> 03:02.723
- Ah...

03:02.724 --> 03:04.826
Hey Game Shakers!

03:04.827 --> 03:07.378
Hope you don't mind
me "droppin' in"!

03:07.379 --> 03:09.619
A-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

03:09.620 --> 03:11.826
GET IT?!?

03:11.827 --> 03:12.827
- Daaad!

03:12.828 --> 03:15.412
- Triiip!

03:15.413 --> 03:17.447
- You promised me
you'd stop puttin' on

03:17.448 --> 03:19.447
that crazy wing suit
and jumpin' outta the sky!

03:19.448 --> 03:21.274
- Aw son, I've promised
you a lotta things

03:21.275 --> 03:23.033
that never came true.

03:23.034 --> 03:24.654
- Well...

03:24.655 --> 03:27.205
- Like remember that time
I promised to get you a pony?

03:27.206 --> 03:29.654
- Yeah.
- And what happened?

03:29.655 --> 03:31.067
- No pony.

03:31.068 --> 03:33.274
- Hahaha!

03:33.275 --> 03:35.550
Aw yeah, and remember how
I promised to take you

03:35.551 --> 03:36.999
on a private tour
of The White House?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.688
- Yeah?
- I already went!

03:39.689 --> 03:41.895
- Awww.

03:41.896 --> 03:43.310
- And I'm not welcome back!

03:45.241 --> 03:46.964
- Look Dad!

03:46.965 --> 03:48.895
All I'm sayin' is:
you puttin' on that wing suit,

03:48.896 --> 03:52.067
and flyin' all over New York,
is dangerous and stupid.

03:52.068 --> 03:56.136
- Awwwww maaaannn.
Wait...

03:56.137 --> 03:58.792
Okay, if you have
a loose thread,

03:58.793 --> 04:01.310
don't yank on it.

04:02.862 --> 04:06.344
- And you all are worried

04:50.827 --> 04:52.309
What happened to your neck?

04:52.310 --> 04:53.585
- Oh, last night

04:53.586 --> 04:55.447
I was volunteering
at the animal shelter...

04:55.448 --> 04:57.067
- Yeah...?

04:57.068 --> 04:58.826
- And I was playing with
this cute lil' bush weasel,

04:58.827 --> 05:01.965
and we were snuzzling,
and it bit my neck.

05:02.931 --> 05:04.654
But I don't blame the weasel.

05:04.655 --> 05:07.723
He probably thought
my neck was a predator.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.378
- Well, you do have
an aggressive looking neck.

05:10.379 --> 05:11.688
- So, what's that?

05:11.689 --> 05:13.274
- Ooo yeah! This...

05:13.275 --> 05:15.550
Oh! Wait.
Hudson, c'mere.

05:15.551 --> 05:18.343
- Comin' there.

05:18.344 --> 05:19.310
- Hey. whatcha need?

05:19.311 --> 05:20.585
- Pop that shirt off.

05:20.586 --> 05:21.826
- Yes ma'am.

05:21.827 --> 05:23.757
- Okay, what's happening here?

05:23.758 --> 05:25.999
- You'll see in a second.
Here, put this on.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.205
- 'Kay-kay.

05:28.206 --> 05:30.861
I'm puttin' my shirt on...

05:30.862 --> 05:33.136
Shirt goes on!
One arm...

05:33.137 --> 05:34.240
Two arm!

05:34.241 --> 05:35.964
- Nice!

05:35.965 --> 05:37.240
Now, arms out...

05:37.241 --> 05:38.688
- There ya go...

05:38.689 --> 05:40.723

fasten the buckles.

05:40.724 --> 05:42.550
- 'Kay-kay...
- All right...

05:42.551 --> 05:43.654
- All right, put that there...

05:43.655 --> 05:45.240
fix the Game Shakers...

05:45.241 --> 05:46.412
- Hehe... that tickles.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.550
- Oh. Sorry.
- Sorry.

05:47.551 --> 05:50.689
- No, I like it.

05:52.793 --> 05:54.964
- Okay. so are you gonna
tell me what all this is for?

05:54.965 --> 05:56.930
- Sure.
This is a Yo-Pro harness,

05:56.931 --> 05:58.654
and this is a Yo-Pro camera...

05:58.655 --> 06:00.412
and it's gonna live stream
video of Hudson,

06:00.413 --> 06:02.550
all day and all night.

06:02.551 --> 06:03.826
- I'm Hudson.

06:03.827 --> 06:06.136
- Yeah, we know that,
baby, shhhhh.

06:06.137 --> 06:08.688
- Well, why do we want
people to watch Hudson?

06:08.689 --> 06:10.930
- 'Cuz! Yesterday when
he was pulling his thread

06:10.931 --> 06:12.412
and unraveling his shirt,

06:12.413 --> 06:14.343
the number of people
watching shot up

06:14.344 --> 06:17.481
from 240,000 to 375,000.

06:17.482 --> 06:18.895
- I know that but...
- Sooo...

06:18.896 --> 06:20.757
all those people watching Hudson

06:20.758 --> 06:22.964
are gonna see him wearing
a Game Shakers t-shirt,

06:22.965 --> 06:25.585
and that's gonna help us
promote our games.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.826
And Hudson, you are live.

06:27.827 --> 06:32.309
- Yay.
Hello world, and France.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.412
Guten tag!

06:33.413 --> 06:34.861
- Check it out...

06:34.862 --> 06:36.895
in realtime we can
see how many people

06:36.896 --> 06:39.826
are watching him,
and here we can read comments.

06:39.827 --> 06:42.240
- And what happens
when he takes a shower?

06:42.241 --> 06:44.412
- Well, usually I start
by washing my feet,

06:44.413 --> 06:45.585
then I work my way up.

06:45.586 --> 06:48.102
- That's not what I mean.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.619
- Obviously, when
he takes a shower,

06:50.620 --> 06:52.033
he doesn't wear the camera.

06:52.034 --> 06:54.723
- Why not?

06:54.724 --> 06:56.585
- 'Cuz you can't
be on camera naked.

06:56.586 --> 06:57.930
- Ohhh please.

06:57.931 --> 07:00.310
Like I'd ever shower naked.

07:08.758 --> 07:10.792
- This is fantastic.

07:10.793 --> 07:12.309
- Ahhh...
This is amazing.

07:12.310 --> 07:14.102
- Okay...

07:14.103 --> 07:16.757
it's been about
forty minutes now...

07:16.758 --> 07:20.171
and I still can't
get this package open.

07:20.172 --> 07:21.240
- See this?

07:21.241 --> 07:23.619
Over 400,000 people,

07:23.620 --> 07:27.171
just watching him try
to open a package.

07:27.172 --> 07:30.412
- This might be
the best idea you ever had.

07:30.413 --> 07:31.964
- Oh no.
No no no.

07:31.965 --> 07:34.861
Just watch...
watch me do this...

07:34.862 --> 07:36.931
- Oh no...
Babe...

07:40.551 --> 07:43.136
- Hey...
here...

07:43.137 --> 07:45.447
you can use this
pair of scissors

07:45.448 --> 07:48.757
to open the package.

07:48.758 --> 07:51.034
- Ah. Thanks.

07:55.137 --> 07:58.137
- Okay, now I just gotta
open up these scissors...

08:00.827 --> 08:02.792
Just a sec...

08:02.793 --> 08:05.931
Okay, this is feeling
like a familiar problem...

08:09.586 --> 08:11.481
- Grover G. Griffin!

08:11.482 --> 08:13.861
- Ohhh sheep.
- Mmhmm...

08:13.862 --> 08:17.033
I need talk to you, Grover.

08:17.034 --> 08:19.619
- Dad, you know I don't like
anyone callin' me Grover.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.758
- Oh. I'm sorry... Grover.

08:24.620 --> 08:26.826
- All right Dub,
what's your issue today?

08:26.827 --> 08:28.378
- I tell ya my issue.

08:28.379 --> 08:31.757
Somebody took my wing suit.

08:31.758 --> 08:34.447
Now I don't have my wing suit

08:34.448 --> 08:36.930
and I got a feelin'

08:36.931 --> 08:41.931
I know WHO TOOK my wing suit.

08:44.655 --> 08:46.792
Grover...?

08:46.793 --> 08:49.861
- Yeah!
Yeah, I took your wing suit.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.895
- I knew it!!!
Aww...

08:51.896 --> 08:53.412
- Dude, why'd you
take his wing suit?

08:53.413 --> 08:54.999
- 'Cuz I love my dad,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.240
and I don't wanna see him
jump outta his helicopter

08:57.241 --> 09:00.688
and end up flyin' into
some brick wall goin

09:00.689 --> 09:02.378
- Oh please, I'm not gonna

09:02.379 --> 09:05.205
fly into some brick wall goin'

09:05.206 --> 09:07.654
- Okay, what if
somethin' goes wrong?

09:07.655 --> 09:09.309
- That's why I wear a parachute!

09:09.310 --> 09:12.102
- Okay, what if your
parachute doesn't open?

09:12.103 --> 09:14.896
- Well, that's why
I bought these!

09:16.758 --> 09:18.826
- Whoa!
You got rocket boots?!?

09:18.827 --> 09:21.826
- Ahehehehehehey!
That's right!

09:21.827 --> 09:24.654
So, in case something
happens to my wing suit,

09:24.655 --> 09:26.481
or my parachute doesn't work,

09:26.482 --> 09:29.172
all I have to do is go, ooh.

09:35.793 --> 09:38.241
Mmmhmmm!

09:39.586 --> 09:41.309
Ahahahaha!

09:41.310 --> 09:42.585
- Whoa!!!
- Haha!

09:42.586 --> 09:45.931
- Whoooaaa.

09:47.931 --> 09:50.034
- Hey hey!
Woo!

09:54.827 --> 09:56.964
See?! Now tell me
where ya put my wing suit!

09:56.965 --> 09:59.826
- Maybe I forgot!

09:59.827 --> 10:01.274
- Oh! You put Dub's wing
suit over there,

10:01.275 --> 10:02.309
in the donut pit!

10:02.310 --> 10:04.205
- Hudson!
- Dude!

10:04.206 --> 10:05.481
- Ha!

10:05.482 --> 10:07.067
- Why'd you tell him that?!?

10:07.068 --> 10:08.516
- You said you forgot.

10:08.517 --> 10:11.826
- Ahahahahah!!!

10:11.827 --> 10:14.619
- Oh no! Dub,

10:14.620 --> 10:17.792

10:17.793 --> 10:21.550
Hello, wing suit!

10:21.551 --> 10:23.654

10:30.310 --> 10:32.895
and throw some eggs
at some pigeons!

10:32.896 --> 10:35.309
Ha-kah! Kah-kah!

10:35.310 --> 10:37.343
- Wh-that's not
the sound pigeons make!

10:37.344 --> 10:38.550
- All right well...

10:38.551 --> 10:39.826
- Dub, no!

10:42.310 --> 10:45.378

10:45.379 --> 10:46.482
I need to fly!

11:10.724 --> 11:12.723
- Owwww...

11:12.724 --> 11:14.999
- What's wrong with her?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.343
- Ah, she got bitten
by a bush weasel.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.205
- Ah, of course.

11:20.206 --> 11:22.205
- Hey, did your mom get
your doctor on the phone?

11:22.206 --> 11:23.895
- Yeah, he said the bush weasel

11:23.896 --> 11:25.757
probably had some
mouth bacteria,

11:25.758 --> 11:27.896
and now I have an infection.

11:29.103 --> 11:30.792
- Awww, poor Kenz.

11:30.793 --> 11:34.171
- Yeah, but that's whatcha get
for snuzzlin' a weasel.

11:34.172 --> 11:37.205
- Hey, I'm supposed to go
pick up some pills and ointment.

11:37.206 --> 11:38.688
Will you guys help me
get to the drug store?

11:38.689 --> 11:40.930
- Sure.
- Yeah.

11:40.931 --> 11:43.895
- Stay steady.
There you go.

11:43.896 --> 11:46.067
- Hey Hudson...

11:46.068 --> 11:47.550

11:47.551 --> 11:48.792

- 'Kay-kay.

11:48.793 --> 11:50.067

this pair of scissors

12:12.551 --> 12:14.448
to open the flashlight.

12:34.586 --> 12:37.930
- Uh, what was the name of
the pills the doctor gave her?

12:37.931 --> 12:40.654
- Um...

12:40.655 --> 12:43.344
Spazerol.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.826
- Check the side-effects.

12:46.827 --> 12:49.274
- Spazerol...

12:49.275 --> 12:52.309
- Hey! Did you guys
lock up Game Shakers?

12:52.310 --> 12:54.481
Did you lock the doors?
Did you turn on the alarm?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.205
Who's that guy? Hey!

12:56.206 --> 12:57.619
Did someone lock the doors
and turn on the alarm?

12:57.620 --> 12:59.206
Hey!!!!!

13:01.275 --> 13:04.136
- Did you find the side-effects?

13:04.137 --> 13:05.654
- Oh uh...
Yeah, it says,

13:05.655 --> 13:09.619
"One Spazerol is equivalent
to forty cups of coffee.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.309
Side-effects include:
Hyper activity,

13:11.310 --> 13:13.793
rapid speech
and extreme mood swings."

13:15.206 --> 13:19.206
- Ahhhh!

13:20.655 --> 13:24.205
I just love you guys so much!

13:24.206 --> 13:28.067
I just wanna know
what time it is...

13:28.068 --> 13:31.171

I need to build a clock.

13:36.172 --> 13:38.136
- Whoa.
- What?

13:38.137 --> 13:39.826
- I'm not sure but...

13:39.827 --> 13:43.654
now there's over 7000,000
people watching Hudson.

13:43.655 --> 13:45.481
- 700,000?

13:45.482 --> 13:47.550
- Yeah, pull up his Let's Play,

13:47.551 --> 13:49.895

13:49.896 --> 13:52.447
- Okay, as you can see,

13:52.448 --> 13:57.274
I'm now wearing
the rocket boots...

13:57.275 --> 14:00.033
- Why does he have my
dad's rocket boots on?

14:00.034 --> 14:03.067
- I dunno.
Unless he... Oh my God!

14:03.068 --> 14:04.723
- What?!?
- He's gonna go up!

14:04.724 --> 14:07.171
- Wh-But-but he doesn't
know how to work those boots!

14:07.172 --> 14:10.067
- I know... Why do you think
I'm tryin' to call him?!?

14:10.068 --> 14:12.724
- Okay guys, get ready...

14:16.000 --> 14:17.619

14:17.620 --> 14:19.033
Answer Hudson!

14:19.034 --> 14:22.412
Ooo, my phone's ringing...

14:22.413 --> 14:24.205
but I'll answer that later.

14:24.206 --> 14:26.378
- Nooooo!
- No! Answer it now!

14:26.379 --> 14:29.757
- One small step
for a blonde boy...

14:29.758 --> 14:31.378
- Oh my God!
- Don't do it!

14:31.379 --> 14:34.724
- One giant leap
for Game Shakers.

14:37.655 --> 14:39.413
- Hudson!
- Ah geez!

14:42.758 --> 14:46.067
- Wheeeeeeeeee!!!

14:49.586 --> 14:53.172
- Hey! Betcha never saw me
sit upside down before!

15:06.517 --> 15:08.309
- Okay, it's pretty late now...

15:08.310 --> 15:11.861
and I'm uh...
somewhere up in the sky...

15:11.862 --> 15:14.550
flying...
with my rocket boots.

15:14.551 --> 15:16.585
And I sure wish
I knew how to land.

15:16.586 --> 15:19.516
- Oh man! You gotta
get Hudson on the phone!!!

15:19.517 --> 15:20.930
- I'm trying!

15:20.931 --> 15:23.378
You see the phone against
the side of my face, right?

15:23.379 --> 15:26.447
C'mon Hudson!
Answer!

15:26.448 --> 15:30.550
Uh-oh...

15:30.551 --> 15:33.964
Uh-oh!!!!!

15:33.965 --> 15:37.240
I think I'm goin' down!!!

15:37.241 --> 15:39.654
- No, don't go down!
Don't go down! Go up! Go up!

15:39.655 --> 15:41.550
- What, what's happening?!?
Did Hudson land?!?

15:41.551 --> 15:43.550
- I dunno!
The video's breakin' up!

15:43.551 --> 15:47.412
- Come on. Fly away.
Fly like a bird.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.930
- Hey Babe! Trip!
Look!

15:49.931 --> 15:52.481
I made a clock!

15:52.482 --> 15:56.067
Ahhhhhhh!

15:56.068 --> 15:59.033
- Okay, I don't care
what your doctor says,

15:59.034 --> 16:01.964
no more pills for you.

16:01.965 --> 16:03.171
- Meh!

16:03.172 --> 16:04.757
- That's not a word.

16:04.758 --> 16:07.240
- Ooo! Ooo! He's back,
Hudson's back!

16:07.241 --> 16:08.516
- He is?!?
Is he okay?!?

16:08.517 --> 16:11.447
- My rocket boots
ran outta fuel,

16:11.448 --> 16:13.067
so I'm not flying anymore.

16:13.068 --> 16:16.205
I'm stuck up here...
somewhere...

16:16.206 --> 16:18.240
- Where?!?
- Stuck up where?!?

16:18.241 --> 16:20.999
- Looks like I'm on
some type of bridge...

16:21.000 --> 16:22.516
Possibly in Brooklyn.

16:22.517 --> 16:25.136
- The Brooklyn Bridge?!?
- Oh my God!

16:25.137 --> 16:26.964
- And since
I'm outta boot juice,

16:26.965 --> 16:30.585
I'm not sure how to get
down from here, so...

16:30.586 --> 16:32.309
I'm gonna call my boss, Babe...

16:32.310 --> 16:34.550
- Ooo good, good!
- Yeah, he's gonna call you!

16:34.551 --> 16:38.723
