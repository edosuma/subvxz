00:09.593 --> 00:12.193
Yo, J, what up, son, where you been?

00:12.493 --> 00:15.292
I ain't been nowhere, T.
Just laying low, man.

00:15.893 --> 00:18.192
Now watch, you gonna see
Darnell's little brother...

00:18.292 --> 00:20.493
come on out with that laundry basket.

00:20.593 --> 00:24.492
-And the take's in the basket?
-Once in the afternoon, and one at night.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.892
Always the same laundry basket.

00:27.893 --> 00:29.292
How you know?

00:29.392 --> 00:32.092
That money got to come out somehow, man.

00:32.792 --> 00:35.092
So, we ain't got to blast our way
to the top floor.

00:35.192 --> 00:38.492
We just wait till they're in the street
with their shit.

00:39.291 --> 00:43.091
We gonna do them tonight, you heard?
After it get dark.

00:48.891 --> 00:50.490
Just like you say.

00:50.790 --> 00:53.390
Put the basket down now, put it down!

00:53.490 --> 00:56.891
-Fuck, I said put the basket down!
-Easy girl, chill.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.091
You all niggers, you got caught slipping.

00:59.191 --> 01:02.191
Sorry it had to go down like this, baby,
because your ass is cute.

01:02.291 --> 01:03.991
But you got got.

01:04.090 --> 01:05.991
Nice, very nice.

01:13.190 --> 01:14.390
Bitches!

01:14.490 --> 01:16.690
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:15.385 --> 03:16.383
No English.

03:21.784 --> 03:22.884
Kunta Kinte...

03:24.183 --> 03:25.684
yabba dabba dabba doo.

03:27.984 --> 03:31.584
Mishy gishy gushy gushy
mishy meshy mushy, motherfucker.

03:34.983 --> 03:37.883
Negro, you cannot travel
halfway around the world...

03:37.983 --> 03:40.083
and not speak any motherfucking English.

03:42.783 --> 03:44.883
English, motherfucker!

03:45.883 --> 03:48.783
Two missing, and the rest
ain't saying shit we can understand.

03:48.883 --> 03:52.182
I tried to tell you,
with the questions you all are asking.

03:52.282 --> 03:55.182
We step off ship,
English is once again heard, right?

03:55.282 --> 03:56.982
Pretty much, yeah.

03:59.483 --> 04:03.083
Here's what's left of Osman.
He was with us since Trieste.

04:03.782 --> 04:06.582
Choksey took all his gear when he jumped.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.981
-You get a lot of guys jumping ship?
-Some.

04:10.082 --> 04:13.082
Usually after a pay,
which we made in Norfolk.

04:13.182 --> 04:16.582
Choksey actually asked for an advance,
which we did using ship's scrip.

04:17.582 --> 04:22.081
Nothing here in the way of ID papers
or money. He grabbed that at least.

04:22.481 --> 04:25.381
Anybody else ask for any advances
while you were at sea?

04:25.481 --> 04:28.080
-More than usual.
-Yeah?

04:28.180 --> 04:32.381
A few of them were coming back
day after day, scripting more and more cash.

04:32.581 --> 04:34.981
We figured they were
gambling down in the holds.

04:35.081 --> 04:36.881
And maybe not, right?

04:41.079 --> 04:44.081
The can with the girls was in Bay 9
on the bottom, outside.

04:44.181 --> 04:46.380
-Did you check that bay?
-I did.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.080
It's full of cans for export,
loaded in Hampton Roads.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.580
No sign of anything
except a fresh stack of containers.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.579
I'm not gonna lie to you. If you hold us
another day and bring in interpreters...

04:55.679 --> 04:57.479
they're still not gonna say a thing.

04:57.579 --> 05:01.879
The unwritten rule is that what happens
below decks stays below decks.

05:09.678 --> 05:12.778
Sit up, Nicky,
we got paying customers waiting.

05:15.978 --> 05:17.579
Ashley, sit down.

05:19.979 --> 05:22.178
You think I cut it too short?

05:23.078 --> 05:25.279
Just don't make me look funny.

05:28.178 --> 05:30.078
Ashley's preschool called.

05:30.178 --> 05:33.077
-They want more money?
-Just what we owe them.

05:33.477 --> 05:35.977
-And her teacher says that--
-Teacher?

05:36.478 --> 05:39.378
-They ain't nothing but baby-sitters.
-Whatever.

05:39.478 --> 05:42.876
Ashley's been talking in class
about how Mom and Dad don't live together.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.477
Who asks her about that?

05:44.877 --> 05:47.777
No one asks, she just talks.

05:48.378 --> 05:50.677
Kids notice stuff like that.
They talk, you know?

05:50.777 --> 05:53.477
By the time she's in elementary school,
it's going to be an issue.

05:53.577 --> 05:56.377
Time she gets that far,
we'll be under the same roof.

05:56.777 --> 05:58.476
You said that last Christmas.

05:58.576 --> 06:01.676
Christ, Aimee!
You pulling it out or cutting it?

06:02.376 --> 06:03.876
Listen, Nicky.

06:04.376 --> 06:07.776
You want to go get to someplace better,
I'm with you.

06:08.776 --> 06:12.577
You wanna keep on like this,
then I got to rethink stuff.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.275
Do what you feel.

06:18.775 --> 06:23.076
As soon as I start getting more hours,
the first thing I do is get my own place.

06:23.176 --> 06:25.575
You wanna move in with me, great.

06:25.675 --> 06:28.876
You don't want to,
at least I did my goddamn best.

06:40.075 --> 06:44.174
You want a streak or something?
I could put a little purple in it.

06:45.074 --> 06:46.475
Yeah, and right after that...

06:46.575 --> 06:50.174
I'll just go ahead
and stick my tongue up some guy's ass.

07:20.372 --> 07:21.872
Got you good, huh?

07:26.072 --> 07:27.773
You think?

07:27.873 --> 07:29.872
No, I mean, not really.

07:29.972 --> 07:33.172
Not if Evidence Control
is the posting you want.

07:35.472 --> 07:37.871
-Sorry, Lieutenant.
-Fuck it, right?

07:38.372 --> 07:42.071
We brought in the case at least.
Heard you were on the boat.

07:43.472 --> 07:44.872
Ain't so bad.

07:47.671 --> 07:49.171
How's Kima?

07:49.971 --> 07:51.472
She's inside.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.771
Asset Forfeiture.
And she's second year pre-law.

07:55.171 --> 07:58.071
Housecat. That ain't her.

08:00.671 --> 08:02.571
-This coming back?
-Yeah.

08:03.671 --> 08:05.271
It's the Gant case right there.

08:05.371 --> 08:07.071
Nathan looked over our weak shit...

08:07.171 --> 08:09.670
told me to go find Omar this week
or she drops charges.

08:09.770 --> 08:11.971
-You got a line on him lately?
-I haven't a clue.

08:12.071 --> 08:15.270
Last thing I did
was put him on a bus to New York.

08:20.970 --> 08:22.770
You keep your head low, Lieutenant.

08:22.869 --> 08:25.369
A year or two,
you'll be back in their favor, right?

08:25.469 --> 08:27.869
Year or two, and I'll be a lawyer.

08:28.269 --> 08:31.669
I got 22 years in.
I'm putting the papers in this week.

08:32.169 --> 08:33.568
You're gone?

08:34.669 --> 08:38.370
What the hell am I doing down here
with a law degree, right?

08:40.568 --> 08:41.868
You take care, McNulty.

08:42.568 --> 08:43.868
You, too.

09:08.867 --> 09:12.967
Kimmy, all I'm trying to say is,
if you'd stop lighting up all the damn time...

09:13.067 --> 09:15.867
-maybe you'd understand--
-I'm gonna light up regardless.

09:15.967 --> 09:18.767
-It took us too long.
-You know I love you, but if your ass...

09:18.867 --> 09:21.667
don't get to finishing counting
all my motherfucking money....

09:21.767 --> 09:25.467
-Shit, you know I love you, but damn.
-Almost five.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.766
We got them motherfuckers good.

09:30.066 --> 09:32.967
Let's see them motherfuckers slip next time.

09:33.067 --> 09:34.665
Who the fuck is you?

09:34.765 --> 09:38.366
-Omar come a-calling.
-Omar? Shit.

09:38.466 --> 09:41.866
Ain't that nigger dead?
I heard them project niggers lit him up.

09:41.966 --> 09:44.865
No, I heard they ran his ass up
out of this town.

09:46.665 --> 09:49.966
Spread the word, darling, Omar back.

09:57.366 --> 09:59.666
Look at the way
Crutchfield spelled "prostrate."

09:59.766 --> 10:00.966
Look at it.

10:01.466 --> 10:04.365
"The above referenced victim
was prostate on the floor."

10:06.965 --> 10:09.865
"Prostate on the floor."
That's a victim, all right.

10:09.965 --> 10:11.465
That hurts bad.

10:13.364 --> 10:15.265
I love this job, I do.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.364
-You want to hear about Philly, Sarge?
-Just the dirty parts.

10:18.465 --> 10:21.664
The ship's a dead end.
The cargo bay that held our container...

10:21.764 --> 10:24.064
is full of new boxes,
nothing to recover there.

10:24.264 --> 10:27.864
And all them sailors, they lied to us
in every language past English.

10:27.965 --> 10:29.263
Gibbering motherfuckers.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.464
Sailing up the coast right now,
laughing at us.

10:32.464 --> 10:33.564
Is that it?

10:33.664 --> 10:36.363
Two guys jumped ship.
We'll put out teletypes...

10:36.463 --> 10:38.563
in case that has
anything to do with anything.

10:38.663 --> 10:40.663
One of them left his gear, and we kept that.

10:40.863 --> 10:44.263
-Sounds like some weak-ass shit to me.
-Because it is.

10:44.663 --> 10:47.563
But your suspect
had to be on the boat, right?

10:47.663 --> 10:49.163
And your boat has sailed.

10:49.263 --> 10:52.463
Jay, what the fuck were we supposed to do?

10:52.563 --> 10:56.162
Hold the ship while we chat up
a crew of 40 in 53 dialects? Come on.

10:56.962 --> 10:59.263
If that isn't the plan, what is?

11:09.962 --> 11:12.062
-Officer....
-Russell.

11:14.061 --> 11:16.462
I am informed that you are detailed
to this case...

11:16.562 --> 11:18.962
as a liaison with the port police.

11:21.062 --> 11:24.860
I also understand
that you are the only help...

11:24.960 --> 11:26.461
that your department is sending.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.660
That so?

11:27.761 --> 11:31.661
Although there is some small charm
to a woman in uniform...

11:31.761 --> 11:34.860
the fact remains
we work plainclothes in Homicide.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.861
Which is not to say
that the clothes need be plain.

11:37.961 --> 11:41.859
For you, I would suggest some pantsuits,
perhaps muted in color.

11:41.959 --> 11:45.960
Something to offset Det. Moreland's
pinstriped lawyerly affectations...

11:46.060 --> 11:49.561
and the brash, tweedy impertinence
of Det. Freamon.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.760
Rawls is watching on this one.

11:53.860 --> 11:56.860
Let's at least pretend we got a fucking clue.

11:59.259 --> 12:01.059
Tweedy impertinence?

12:03.960 --> 12:06.660
-I like that.
-You know what I'm saying?

12:08.358 --> 12:11.558
-It's not here, Major.
-I can see that. Where is it?

12:11.758 --> 12:13.959
The Flex Squad used it last Tuesday.

12:14.059 --> 12:17.159
The vehicle log says
they parked it at 22:00 hours...

12:17.258 --> 12:19.058
returning the keys to the OIC.

12:19.258 --> 12:21.359
-And?
-We have the keys.

12:22.258 --> 12:23.859
But not the van?

12:25.259 --> 12:28.657
Are you telling me that a fully equipped...

12:28.757 --> 12:32.257
$1 20,000 surveillance van...

12:32.358 --> 12:35.857
assigned to the southeastern district
cannot be located?

12:54.257 --> 12:56.557
-Around the world....
-In 880 days.

13:14.256 --> 13:17.255
-Do we have a plan?
-A plan?

13:17.655 --> 13:21.155
-For targeting this guy, Sobotka.
-I don't know.

13:22.055 --> 13:25.356
Maybe find out where his union hangs...

13:25.456 --> 13:28.556
go down there with a CI or two,
make some hand-to-hands.

13:28.656 --> 13:31.655
-How about some DNRs on his phones?
-DNRs?

13:31.755 --> 13:34.655
See who he's calling,
and look for any kind of pattern.

13:34.755 --> 13:37.055
Hand-to-hands for now, I think.

14:09.953 --> 14:11.953
600 series, and that's it.

14:13.454 --> 14:14.952
That's right.

14:15.853 --> 14:17.953
This is too nice a block for a prison guard.

14:18.053 --> 14:21.153
Shit, you couldn't pay me enough
to work in no prison, man.

14:21.253 --> 14:24.052
Yeah, right, no.
I want you to drop all the cellular joints.

14:24.152 --> 14:29.052
-Yeah, all of them, Nokia, Motorola.
-Listen to Stringer play Wall Street.

14:29.853 --> 14:31.652
All right, so call me, yeah.

14:31.752 --> 14:35.352
String, why you so down
on the phone companies, man?

14:36.052 --> 14:38.751
While back, I took a stroll through the Pit.

14:38.851 --> 14:41.951
I saw that kid
we got running things down there, Poot.

14:42.951 --> 14:46.552
He got the cell phone I gave him
for the business, right there on his hip...

14:46.652 --> 14:50.752
but the nigger got another cell phone
that only ring when the pussy called.

14:50.852 --> 14:53.351
Now, if this no-count nigger
got two cell phones...

14:53.451 --> 14:57.051
how the fuck you gonna sell
any more of them motherfuckers?

14:57.451 --> 14:59.451
That's market saturation.

15:04.051 --> 15:05.651
Look here.

15:07.051 --> 15:09.051
That Tilghman right there.

15:09.150 --> 15:12.549
-Dressed like a prison guard and all.
-Yeah, I see him.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.850
Steel door.
The boy on the step is all, though.

15:19.950 --> 15:23.650
Stump is sitting in the front room window,
staring at the damn television.

15:23.750 --> 15:27.849
-You all could see that from the step?
-There in his damn drawers.

15:33.049 --> 15:34.450
Shut up, dog!

15:38.749 --> 15:41.149
Rat make that trash, he home free.

15:41.650 --> 15:44.949
Junk better get in closer
if he want a shot at him.

15:48.749 --> 15:52.049
I got $20 on Mr. Rat. Anyone fade me?

15:54.049 --> 15:56.249
Move along. Come on, get there.

15:57.848 --> 15:59.748
$100 says it ain't over.

15:59.848 --> 16:02.148
Shit, I got to take easy money.

16:03.847 --> 16:05.348
What the fuck?

16:07.447 --> 16:11.148
-Motherfucker.
-Sounds about over now, though.

16:12.648 --> 16:14.947
How the hell you know
what the rat gonna do?

16:15.047 --> 16:17.047
Junk do know his varmints.

16:34.347 --> 16:35.446
Yeah.

16:39.047 --> 16:41.046
What's wrong with you, boy?

16:43.647 --> 16:48.145
Look, I done told you before, man.
Those two babies don't move me that way.

16:48.245 --> 16:51.046
If I come up with a plan
to do Stump without them...

16:51.146 --> 16:52.845
you cut them loose?

16:52.945 --> 16:55.546
Now you gone and got strategic on me?

16:56.046 --> 16:59.145
We do like last time,
and wait for him to come out.

16:59.745 --> 17:03.146
Only problem is,
Stump live in that rat hole, baby.

17:05.645 --> 17:09.344
So, he ain't got to bring the cash out.
See what I'm saying?

17:09.944 --> 17:12.944
Then we charge in, guns a-blazing.

17:13.845 --> 17:15.544
Steel door, right?

17:18.244 --> 17:20.743
What's it gonna take
for you to be convinced, man?

17:20.844 --> 17:22.743
I don't bag no babies.

17:27.644 --> 17:29.144
What you think?

17:51.544 --> 17:54.142
You gonna have to do better than that.

17:55.543 --> 17:56.642
Indeed.

18:04.442 --> 18:08.142
Thinking, maybe do a quarter this time,
if it's not too much.

18:09.042 --> 18:10.541
That a problem?

18:11.141 --> 18:12.242
No.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.742
I'm just saying, you back right quick with it.

18:18.642 --> 18:22.342
It ain't like them motherfuckers
got anything else to do up in there, right?

18:22.442 --> 18:26.442
-The shit is everyday, man.
-Sounds right. It count right, too?

18:28.640 --> 18:30.940
Boy'll bring it to you outside.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.641
There's Tilghman.

18:48.340 --> 18:50.940
So, his shit coming from Butchie then?

18:52.640 --> 18:55.540
-All right.
-Lying Butchie.

18:58.739 --> 19:02.640
-Santa's elves are short.
-Santa's elves aren't real.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.139
The elves in Lord of the Rings
are, like, real elves.

19:05.339 --> 19:07.940
-Real elves?
-They should be short, then.

19:08.039 --> 19:12.840
Dwarves are short, hobbits are short.
Elves are tall and immortal.

19:12.940 --> 19:16.839
If you weren't too scared to watch the movie
then you'd know all about it, doofus.

19:16.939 --> 19:18.139
Bite me, dickbreath.

19:18.239 --> 19:21.139
-Sean, knock it off.
-He started it.

19:22.039 --> 19:25.138
Okay, upstairs right away,
brush your teeth, pajamas.

19:25.238 --> 19:27.239
It's a school night, Sean.

19:28.439 --> 19:30.138
Can I tuck them in?

19:33.438 --> 19:36.938
My lawyer's gonna be
sending you something in the mail.

19:37.038 --> 19:39.738
-You're kidding.
-It's not a divorce, it's an agreement.

19:39.838 --> 19:42.737
-A separation agreement.
-A separation agreement?

19:42.837 --> 19:46.337
Just read it. Okay? It's for the both of us.

19:46.437 --> 19:47.938
It's to protect the both of us.

19:48.038 --> 19:49.536
This is about what?

19:50.237 --> 19:51.537
It's just....

19:52.837 --> 19:55.138
You should just read it, okay?

19:58.837 --> 20:00.337
Okay.

20:17.436 --> 20:20.235
Another goddamn day we put our cards up
and get nothing.

20:21.035 --> 20:25.036
-Zig, I don't know why I fucking bother.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

20:25.535 --> 20:28.035
One ship today, nothing yesterday.

20:28.135 --> 20:30.435
Wait for Thursday,
a couple ROIROs hit the berth...

20:30.535 --> 20:33.136
and congratu-fucking-lations,
you grab a day.

20:33.237 --> 20:35.034
Friday's quiet again.

20:35.134 --> 20:38.435
Look at it this way, you know,
at least you get the day off.

20:38.535 --> 20:41.035
Days off is the fucking point, Zig.

20:43.834 --> 20:48.235
I can't keep waking up in the morning
not knowing if I'm gonna get paid.

20:48.435 --> 20:50.734
I got a kid, right? I got a fucking kid...

20:50.834 --> 20:53.833
and a girl that wants
to get married, for Christ's sake.

20:53.933 --> 20:56.634
What the fuck you wanna get married for?

20:57.934 --> 20:59.535
Not saying I do.

20:59.835 --> 21:03.134
But fuck if I even could,
without no pot to piss in.

21:04.634 --> 21:07.733
Aimee is like, "What's the plan," you know?

21:07.833 --> 21:11.432
And I'm down here
wondering if I'm gonna get a day or two.

21:13.733 --> 21:16.534
Aimee's sister broke up with Petie, right?

21:18.934 --> 21:21.433
That's your problem, Zig,
one of them, anyway.

21:21.533 --> 21:23.833
You let that thing of yours lead you around.

21:23.933 --> 21:25.833
You know me, whiskey, cock, and 5:00.

21:25.933 --> 21:27.933
-Just get off me.
-Nicky, look.

21:28.632 --> 21:31.632
If it's money that you're worried about, shit.

21:32.932 --> 21:34.733
Let's pool a few dollars together.

21:34.832 --> 21:37.933
I'll get us hooked up
with a little llello, you know...

21:38.033 --> 21:40.932
turn it around this morning,
we make more money before lunch...

21:41.032 --> 21:42.832
than we can down here all week.

21:42.932 --> 21:44.832
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...

21:44.832 --> 21:46.332
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...

21:46.432 --> 21:48.931
so that I get popped for pocket change.

21:49.031 --> 21:52.632
Fuck that shit, Zig. Seriously.

21:53.632 --> 21:56.730
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll think of something.

22:02.431 --> 22:04.732
1 1900 on that one.

22:05.431 --> 22:08.431
We're looking for 14580, by the manifest.

22:08.831 --> 22:10.831
Can't be, the numbers don't go that high.

22:10.931 --> 22:13.630
You had to figure it'd be this way,
the way the port works.

22:13.731 --> 22:14.730
Yeah?

22:14.830 --> 22:16.930
Why have anything
other than fake companies...

22:17.030 --> 22:20.230
and addresses on the manifest
if you're moving a can with contraband?

22:20.430 --> 22:22.730
And on the other end, too, right?

22:24.230 --> 22:27.430
You can work it back through customs,
but chances are...

22:27.530 --> 22:31.530
this box wasn't picked up anywhere
near this Rue de Rivoli address...

22:31.630 --> 22:33.829
in Le Havre, France.

22:33.929 --> 22:37.529
Hell, there might not even
be a Rue de Rivoli in that town.

22:40.130 --> 22:44.728
A can full of dead girls,
sent to nowhere from nowhere.

23:11.428 --> 23:14.428
-He been good business for me, though.
-Yeah?

23:14.528 --> 23:16.428
Two, three quarters a week.

23:16.528 --> 23:19.027
Mr. Tilghman's money always right,
always on time.

23:19.127 --> 23:21.827
That's why we coming to you for the setup.

23:21.927 --> 23:23.928
-You the man to him.
-I'm just saying.

23:24.127 --> 23:27.427
I know, the money, and you know
we gonna find a way to make that right.

23:27.526 --> 23:30.428
But like I said, I'm not asking for myself.

23:31.227 --> 23:33.327
Now I'm asking for my man.

23:35.027 --> 23:38.226
-Avon's call?
-Wouldn't be here otherwise.

23:41.027 --> 23:44.127
-Avon is Avon.
-Always.

23:49.326 --> 23:52.026
He probably gonna roll past tomorrow.

23:54.025 --> 23:55.525
That'll work.

24:03.325 --> 24:04.626
You see what I'm saying, right?

24:04.726 --> 24:07.525
It makes no sense to bring the girls
all this way and then kill them.

24:07.625 --> 24:11.525
You go all that way to dump it on your boss,
and now you're worrying yourself.

24:11.625 --> 24:14.825
-It's got me thinking is all.
-It's a little late for that, McNulty.

24:14.925 --> 24:18.426
What connects the one girl in the water
with all the other ones in the can?

24:18.626 --> 24:22.323
-If you're right and she isn't local, then--
-She's definitely not local.

24:22.423 --> 24:24.124
The low level of mercury viscosity...

24:24.224 --> 24:27.024
in the amalgam restorations
says Eastern Europe.

24:27.124 --> 24:30.024
-If you say so.
-Trust me, she's not from Dundalk.

24:30.124 --> 24:33.324
Eastern Europe?
Can you narrow it down some?

24:34.224 --> 24:38.523
How's this? Three of the dead girls were
in Budapest, Hungary sometime last year.

24:38.623 --> 24:40.623
How'd you know that?

24:40.923 --> 24:42.823
They bought tits there.

24:43.123 --> 24:47.324
Three of the girls had breast enhancements.
We looked at the bags during the post.

24:47.424 --> 24:49.023
We pulled the lot and serial numbers...

24:49.124 --> 24:53.323
and they trace back to an outpatient
plastic surgery clinic in Budapest.

24:53.423 --> 24:56.423
Would you call them?
Might pull an ID from patient records.

24:56.522 --> 25:00.022
The best they could tell me is the implants
were used some time this fall.

25:00.122 --> 25:03.022
Three girls, three surgeries,
same clinic, right?

25:03.122 --> 25:05.223
-What else?
-What else?

25:05.323 --> 25:08.022
-Fuck you, Jimmy McNulty.
-Okay, you're a fucking god.

25:08.222 --> 25:11.722
There's no one in the game
who can stand in your light, Dr. Frazier, sir.

25:11.822 --> 25:15.321
You have to admit that whole
Budapest thing was a hell of a pull.

25:15.421 --> 25:18.922
-Where's the paperwork on this cat?
-I got it over here.

25:19.322 --> 25:20.522
So go on, what else?

25:20.622 --> 25:24.321
Not much, except the swabs show
that at least seven of the girls in the box...

25:24.421 --> 25:27.320
had vaginal intercourse
within 24 hours of death.

25:27.421 --> 25:30.222
Two had anal and six came back positive
on the oral.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.920
You tell Cole about all this?

25:34.020 --> 25:37.521
I sent the findings off to Homicide,
but Cole ain't on the case, brother.

25:37.621 --> 25:39.422
-No, who is?
-It's your man, Bunk.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.520
And that older guy, his partner, they ate it.

25:46.020 --> 25:47.221
Thanks.

25:56.521 --> 26:00.219
I told you, I brought you a soda.

26:00.319 --> 26:01.719
That better?

26:02.219 --> 26:06.020
Now, look at me.
Don't let those mean boys see you crying.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.320
-Okay?
-Okay.

26:09.019 --> 26:10.820
I'll take care of you.

26:30.918 --> 26:32.218
Mr. Stump!

26:40.618 --> 26:43.318
Them boys been teasing Chantelle again.

26:53.417 --> 26:54.817
You know it.

28:07.314 --> 28:09.013
-Morning.
-Morning.

28:13.114 --> 28:15.813
-Bobby, how you been?
-Not bad.

28:16.213 --> 28:20.014
-Working the tier today?
-Yeah, on J.

28:25.012 --> 28:27.313
-Have a good one.
-Yeah, you, too.

28:28.112 --> 28:30.413
You happy now, bitch?

28:30.513 --> 28:32.913
How was I gonna know
Landsman would pull Cole...

28:33.013 --> 28:34.413
and stick you guys?

28:34.513 --> 28:36.312
You right here with them?

28:36.413 --> 28:38.813
-What did he call Cole?
-"Collateral damage."

28:38.913 --> 28:41.812
I'm feeling pretty damn collateral myself,
I got to say.

28:41.912 --> 28:45.511
Which is why I went to see Dr. Frazier
and work some things out in my head.

28:45.611 --> 28:48.912
Officer McNulty could've
paid this thing no mind, but no.

28:49.012 --> 28:51.513
When his friends are suffering,
he bleeds, too.

28:51.612 --> 28:53.712
Did you see the preliminary?

28:54.312 --> 28:56.812
Positives for oral, vaginal, anal.

28:56.911 --> 28:59.911
No IDs, no passports, no visas,
no real money.

29:00.011 --> 29:02.010
And they're coming
across the water like that.

29:02.210 --> 29:04.311
-Yeah.
-McNulty has a theory.

29:05.011 --> 29:08.412
-Does he now?
-You deductive motherfucker, you.

29:08.512 --> 29:11.911
So he's gonna wander in here
with some Johnny-come-lately bullshit...

29:12.011 --> 29:15.111
about how these girls
are all coming over here as prostitutes...

29:15.211 --> 29:19.309
talking about how if they ain't got the cash
to travel better than a container ship...

29:19.409 --> 29:22.111
then they sure don't have the money
for a plastic surgeon.

29:22.211 --> 29:25.111
Then he's gonna say something
about that one in the water...

29:25.211 --> 29:28.810
being tossed off the ship
after she's already dead from a beat-down.

29:28.910 --> 29:32.610
But why she got beat?
He's gonna ask us that, like we don't know.

29:32.809 --> 29:36.809
He's gonna answer his own question,
saying her swabs are negative, right?

29:36.909 --> 29:40.209
Fuck or fight with all them sailor boys,
and she fought.

29:40.309 --> 29:42.110
So, it got a little rough.

29:42.210 --> 29:45.410
She gets banged around,
she comes up dead.

29:45.509 --> 29:48.409
And then somebody panics,
tosses her in the harbor overnight...

29:48.509 --> 29:49.709
before the ship ties up.

29:49.808 --> 29:51.109
But the other girls saw.

29:51.209 --> 29:54.509
So now, the other girls,
they get told to get back in that can.

29:54.609 --> 29:57.108
And our man, to cover this shit up...

29:57.208 --> 30:00.109
he gets up on top
and bangs down the air pipe.

30:03.608 --> 30:07.107
-Anything else you want to tell us?
-When did you guys get there?

30:07.207 --> 30:11.108
Yesterday, when the ship's first mate
told us that while the ship was at sea...

30:11.208 --> 30:14.007
half the crew came to him
for advances on their salary.

30:14.107 --> 30:16.708
They had one hell of a dice game
going on below deck...

30:16.808 --> 30:18.707
or the boys popped them girls
out of that can.

30:18.807 --> 30:20.108
You talk to the crew?

30:20.208 --> 30:22.307
-In what language?
-Crime scene?

30:22.407 --> 30:24.407
-Nope.
-Anybody missing?

30:24.507 --> 30:27.307
Two guys jumped ship.
One in Philly, one in Norfolk.

30:27.407 --> 30:30.308
But that shit happens all the time,
apparently.

30:31.106 --> 30:35.106
-Got yourself a hell of a case.
-Fuck you very much.

30:35.706 --> 30:38.707
You know what happens to all the girls
if you don't ID them?

30:38.807 --> 30:41.906
Anatomy Board as medical cadavers.
Then a crematorium.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.107
Then that mass grave out at Crownsville.

30:44.207 --> 30:45.707
That bothers you?

30:46.007 --> 30:47.407
Yeah, a little.

30:47.507 --> 30:48.807
Me, too.

30:56.906 --> 30:59.605
-Thanks for hosting this, Father.
-Hope it helps.

30:59.705 --> 31:02.205
You guys have really done
the background on this.

31:02.306 --> 31:05.306
This is more presence
than the port unions have shown in years.

31:05.406 --> 31:08.904
-Is the governor listening?
-It's now or never for us.

31:09.204 --> 31:11.704
And not just the grain pier,
but with the dredging.

31:11.804 --> 31:14.306
I don't care
what the Corps of Engineers' study says.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.005
-The fact remains--
-Excuse me, Bobby.

31:16.204 --> 31:19.805
I just need him to work
the other side of the room on something.

31:21.606 --> 31:23.104
You're wasting time here.

31:24.405 --> 31:26.904
Bobby's District 7, which is middle river...

31:27.004 --> 31:30.304
which means every vote he gets
is somebody with some port connection.

31:30.404 --> 31:32.404
He's a good vote, no matter what we do.

31:32.504 --> 31:34.704
The guys you need to be working
are the guys...

31:34.804 --> 31:37.404
who wouldn't have come
if we hadn't been throwing money at them.

31:37.504 --> 31:40.403
-Like who?
-Like John Carney, from Anne Arundel.

31:40.503 --> 31:43.703
Liz Tobin, from Montgomery.
Clay Davis, from over Westside.

31:43.803 --> 31:46.603
Keep hold of them,
some of your stuff stays in the budgets.

31:46.703 --> 31:49.303
-And they're with us?
-Carney is pretty firm.

31:49.503 --> 31:52.403
Liz will stay solid if the environmentalists
don't get to her.

31:52.604 --> 31:56.702
Clay Davis...that guy, you wanna make sure
you're the last man out of the room.

31:56.802 --> 31:58.203
What do you mean?

31:58.303 --> 32:01.702
I mean, we've given forty large
to the Westside Democratic Organization...

32:01.802 --> 32:03.502
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.

32:03.502 --> 32:03.902
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.

32:04.002 --> 32:05.703
We spent $40,000 on that guy?

32:05.803 --> 32:09.404
Worth it, if he lets your projects
sail through the conference committee.

32:09.504 --> 32:13.301
-Forty fuckin' thousand?
-Am I your lobbyist? Are you paying me?

32:13.501 --> 32:15.802
Trust me. With the players in this room...

32:15.902 --> 32:19.003
the presiding officers and a little help
from the governor's office...

32:19.203 --> 32:21.602
we might squeeze some things out
this session.

32:21.702 --> 32:23.401
Now, go make nice.

32:27.701 --> 32:30.400
-Senator Davis.
-Excuse me.

32:32.101 --> 32:33.601
Hey, partner.

32:35.101 --> 32:37.900
People tell me
it just might be a good year for the port.

32:38.001 --> 32:39.301
Might be.

32:39.501 --> 32:42.101
You all have been stepping up
in a lot of ways.

32:42.201 --> 32:46.800
Hope it continues like that.
You all making friends in a lot of places?

32:46.900 --> 32:48.700
We're friendly guys.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.300
So they came back murders?

33:02.400 --> 33:04.600
I admit, I didn't see that coming at all.

33:04.999 --> 33:06.900
Who could've seen that?

33:07.400 --> 33:09.900
For whoever was having
these girls brought over...

33:10.000 --> 33:12.500
-the net loss is in the millions.
-That much?

33:12.600 --> 33:16.199
One of these girls on the circuit,
going club-to-club on the East Coast...

33:16.300 --> 33:18.799
can bring in half a million
over the next two years.

33:18.899 --> 33:21.300
And that's just
for club work and prostitution.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.999
-So somebody messed up.
-In a big way.

33:24.299 --> 33:27.399
You guys called it.
No such address in Le Havre.

33:27.599 --> 33:30.199
Or for that matter, anywhere in Brittany.

33:30.299 --> 33:33.398
The name and ID of the driver
who signed the bill of lading...

33:33.498 --> 33:35.998
doesn't correspond
to their motor vehicle database.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.899
Dead ends either way.

33:38.199 --> 33:40.998
The girls, they know
what they're coming over for?

33:41.098 --> 33:42.197
Some do.

33:42.297 --> 33:44.898
Some get told they're gonna dance,
or be secretaries.

33:44.999 --> 33:48.399
You gotta understand, they're coming
from places that don't have much.

33:48.499 --> 33:50.797
Romania, Moldavia, Russia, Albania.

33:50.897 --> 33:54.197
40,000 or 50,000 undocumented women
working in the US alone.

33:54.297 --> 33:56.297
50,000? Jesus.

33:56.597 --> 33:59.597
They need a whole new agency
just to police them.

33:59.697 --> 34:01.697
What they need is a union.

34:03.797 --> 34:07.097
-To Stan and Kate.
-Stan and Kate.

34:09.496 --> 34:11.196
Happy anniversary!

34:12.795 --> 34:14.297
Thanks a lot.

34:17.596 --> 34:19.496
-Good time here?
-Yeah.

34:19.596 --> 34:21.596
How is my detail coming?

34:22.496 --> 34:24.795
Lt. Grayson is on top of things, right?

34:24.896 --> 34:29.096
Burrell recommended him.
Said he was really good at property crimes.

34:30.896 --> 34:33.496
-It's gonna take a while.
-You think?

34:33.696 --> 34:35.596
Why? What are you doing?

34:37.695 --> 34:38.895
Not much.

34:40.295 --> 34:43.594
We got no DNRs up.
We're not looking at any union assets.

34:43.695 --> 34:46.094
We're not collecting tag numbers
or anything.

34:46.195 --> 34:49.094
We're not looking for patterns at all.
And that's the thing.

34:49.195 --> 34:51.395
I'm trying to tell you
about the Barksdale thing.

34:51.495 --> 34:54.494
If you go in with the idea
you're gonna eat around the edges...

34:54.594 --> 34:55.893
you never get a meal.

34:55.994 --> 34:59.295
With Barksdale, Daniels and Freamon
had us pulling all kinds of stuff.

34:59.395 --> 35:01.995
DMV records, phone logs,
corporate charter stuff...

35:02.095 --> 35:03.794
political campaign contributions.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.094
If Burrell didn't
break the case down so fast...

35:06.194 --> 35:09.894
we would've brought back $3 or $4 million
in downtown real estate...

35:09.994 --> 35:12.993
not to mention the money
those guys gave to political campaigns.

35:13.193 --> 35:17.693
We were deep, really deep.
I've been trying to tell you.

35:18.193 --> 35:22.893
If it wasn't for Burrell,
that would've been a major case.

35:33.493 --> 35:37.394
-String.
-You know, I just came to check up on you.

35:38.193 --> 35:41.193
-See how you holding it down.
-I'm all right.

35:41.592 --> 35:44.593
-Where the little man at?
-I just put him down.

35:49.191 --> 35:51.392
You want something to drink?

35:54.793 --> 35:57.392
Do D'Angelo know what he's missing?

35:57.792 --> 35:59.291
I'm sure he do.

36:03.391 --> 36:05.890
You just reminded me about something.

36:18.591 --> 36:20.190
Tag's still on it.

36:21.291 --> 36:24.390
He bought it
before he got stopped in Jersey.

36:24.790 --> 36:26.390
Never been worn.

36:27.691 --> 36:30.891
You know,
it's a shame to let things go to waste.

36:34.689 --> 36:37.490
You know,
you can give away the man's clothes...

36:37.590 --> 36:40.090
but that don't make him gone, right?

36:40.190 --> 36:41.390
I ain't forget him.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.489
You ain't been to see him
much neither, though.

36:43.589 --> 36:45.790
-It's been hard.
-It's been hard?

36:45.890 --> 36:47.389
It's been hard on him, too.

36:47.489 --> 36:49.590
A lot of bad things
caught up in a man's head...

36:49.689 --> 36:52.689
when he's on lock-down.
Man need to see his baby mama.

36:52.789 --> 36:54.189
Need to see his child, too.

36:54.289 --> 36:57.289
Only one thing he needs to be secure about,
and if not...

36:58.089 --> 37:01.489
then he might start thinking
he can't do that time...

37:01.589 --> 37:03.788
and then we all got problems.

37:04.288 --> 37:05.888
You understand me?

37:06.888 --> 37:08.688
How you set here?

37:08.788 --> 37:11.888
The apartment, the car,
the money's all right?

37:12.488 --> 37:15.088
-It's good.
-It's good?

37:16.988 --> 37:18.588
I know it's good.

37:20.187 --> 37:22.487
But you know what I'm talking about, right?

37:22.587 --> 37:26.688
We all got a job to do, and your job
is to let D'Angelo know we still family.

37:29.187 --> 37:30.687
It's important.

37:39.487 --> 37:40.886
I'm an XL.

37:45.786 --> 37:47.087
No doubt.

38:45.384 --> 38:48.084
-Your round, Jimmy.
-Jesus.

38:48.183 --> 38:50.383
I'm gonna owe the baby-sitter
half my salary...

38:50.483 --> 38:52.583
if I don't throw myself out of here right now.

38:52.683 --> 38:54.684
-You got kids?
-Two.

38:54.784 --> 38:58.282
-Daddy working late, too?
-Not a day in his goddamn life.

39:00.582 --> 39:02.483
You barely made a dent.

39:05.383 --> 39:06.682
Good night, gents.

39:06.782 --> 39:08.583
-Good night.
-Good night.

39:09.383 --> 39:11.883
-What's that about?
-I don't know.

39:15.282 --> 39:17.081
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

39:17.181 --> 39:19.682
-Solve the fucking case?
-Not a shot.

39:22.883 --> 39:25.682
-I'm gonna give this one a name.
-A name?

39:27.282 --> 39:29.982
She's not going
out to Crownsville, this one.

39:30.081 --> 39:33.182
-Not on me, she's not.
-So what are you gonna do with her?

39:33.282 --> 39:37.181
Pay for a box and a mortician
and ship her back to Bumfuck, Europe?

39:37.281 --> 39:39.582
No, I'm gonna find where her people at.

39:39.682 --> 39:43.881
How does that matter?
You see, this is that Catholic shit, Jimmy.

39:44.581 --> 39:47.480
This is that little altar-boy-guilt talking.

39:48.180 --> 39:50.680
What the fuck I got to feel guilty about?

39:50.780 --> 39:52.680
Let me count the ways.

39:56.181 --> 39:57.980
Good morning, Major.

40:21.678 --> 40:23.279
What the....

40:27.579 --> 40:30.279
Wilmington? Son of a bitch!

40:36.678 --> 40:39.878
-Frank?
-Ring, how's it hanging?

40:41.479 --> 40:43.378
Not so good.

40:44.079 --> 40:46.478
-Not right now.
-Yeah?

40:48.778 --> 40:51.578
I'm late on my dues. You know that, right?

40:51.678 --> 40:53.077
You're late, yeah.

40:53.878 --> 40:57.077
And I'm parking that piece-of-shit Buick
two blocks from the house...

40:57.177 --> 40:59.277
hoping for a lazy repo man.

40:59.777 --> 41:00.978
That bad?

41:01.778 --> 41:05.077
I know you ain't been getting hours,
it's been slow.

41:05.877 --> 41:07.476
Five days last month.

41:07.577 --> 41:09.476
-That's all.
-Is that all?

41:10.277 --> 41:13.176
Look, I got to shit or get off the pot here.

41:14.076 --> 41:16.676
-I'm gonna go with 47.
-Do me a favor.

41:17.177 --> 41:19.477
Frank, you been fair,
I ain't saying otherwise.

41:19.577 --> 41:23.975
It's just there's 60 checkers above me
with more seniority, and that's all she wrote.

41:24.075 --> 41:26.475
Do me a favor.
Go down Clement Street tonight...

41:26.575 --> 41:30.476
give this to Dolores,
tell her you need a beer and a shot on me.

41:31.075 --> 41:34.176
Just do that much.
You have a round on me, you go home.

41:34.276 --> 41:38.276
You wanna come in tomorrow, tell me
you're going with 47, I'm with you on it.

41:40.174 --> 41:41.375
Thanks.

41:58.074 --> 42:01.074
Lane 4, you got a trucker's code and tag.

42:10.974 --> 42:12.874
Pick me a winner, Johnny.

42:29.073 --> 42:32.573
-You're ugly enough to be a teamster.
-Lick me, you whore.

42:34.173 --> 42:37.773
It'll be up on wheels. K-row, slot 1 22.

42:39.173 --> 42:40.473
Roger that.

42:55.872 --> 42:57.673
Look, misdelivery.

42:57.973 --> 43:00.372
Can was supposed to go ashore at Norfolk.

43:00.672 --> 43:04.972
-Yeah, where you want it?
-I'm gonna need it on wheels at K-1 22.

43:05.072 --> 43:07.672
My man'll pick it up there. Thanks, Horse.

44:06.567 --> 44:08.768
Wrong box, misdelivery.

44:18.368 --> 44:19.969
No need to count, Butch.

44:20.069 --> 44:22.268
-My shit always right.
-Hearing.

44:22.468 --> 44:23.867
Hearing is believing.

44:29.168 --> 44:32.467
Boy'll meet you outside
when you ready to roll.

44:32.567 --> 44:34.067
I'm ready now.

44:37.966 --> 44:40.966
No, dog. Not from me you don't.

44:43.667 --> 44:45.166
Later, Butchie.

44:50.167 --> 44:52.867
Your man Avon ain't got no flex.

44:53.267 --> 44:54.665
Afraid not.

45:05.766 --> 45:08.665
Who you like better?
Ultimate Spiderman or regular Spiderman?

45:09.366 --> 45:13.165
-What's the difference?
-See, I'll have to teach you everything.

45:23.365 --> 45:24.966
Excuse me, gents.

45:28.864 --> 45:31.765
What's up, man? How you liking the library?

45:32.864 --> 45:34.165
It'll do.

45:36.764 --> 45:38.365
It's easy on you.

45:38.565 --> 45:42.463
I know a lot of people put in for the gig,
but the gig go to you.

45:42.864 --> 45:44.463
Funny how that go.

45:45.364 --> 45:47.664
So you want me to say thanks?

45:48.364 --> 45:49.663
You ain't got to say shit.

45:49.763 --> 45:52.265
But you need to take heed
of what can be done for you...

45:52.365 --> 45:54.063
if you keep your head straight.

45:54.163 --> 45:56.563
You're just full of favors, ain't you?

45:57.764 --> 46:01.363
You shut your mouth and open your mind...

46:01.864 --> 46:05.163
and you ain't gonna be doing
but a small piece of this 20.

46:05.263 --> 46:08.363
Just like I'm only gonna do
a year or two on this seven.

46:08.463 --> 46:11.062
-Feel me?
-I got priors.

46:11.162 --> 46:15.862
Best I can do is half.
That's 10. I can count to 10.

46:16.662 --> 46:20.461
Some shit is coming down, Dee, okay?
You need to think.

46:21.262 --> 46:24.662
You need to trust,
and you need to get your head right.

46:24.962 --> 46:27.062
Man, my head is where I want it.

46:27.162 --> 46:29.562
-You look dusty lately.
-So what?

46:30.562 --> 46:32.661
What, you my mom up in here now?

46:34.461 --> 46:37.061
That's the weak man's road you're taking.

46:37.962 --> 46:40.161
I ain't never seen you as weak.

46:42.962 --> 46:46.062
Look, I'm just, you know,
every now and again.

46:47.161 --> 46:49.761
That's all I got
to get my head up out of this shithole.

46:49.961 --> 46:52.461
Ain't no more than that?
Because if that's all it is...

46:52.561 --> 46:54.861
you should be able
to give it a rest for a few days.

46:54.961 --> 46:58.660
-Because it ain't no thing, right?
-Yeah, it ain't no thing.

46:58.860 --> 47:00.760
Then you gonna do that?

47:04.360 --> 47:07.559
I'm asking you, man, out of love.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.460
There's always love, Dee.

47:17.060 --> 47:19.360
All right. Yeah.

47:20.359 --> 47:22.959
A few days. Sure, a few days.

47:24.658 --> 47:25.759
Right.

48:13.657 --> 48:16.457
All right, what have you got?

48:17.457 --> 48:19.956
All digital. Four megapix,
16 megs of memory...

48:20.056 --> 48:23.657
3X optical, 4X digital zoom.
That's brand new on the market.

48:23.757 --> 48:25.657
That's the Cadillac of cameras right there.

48:25.757 --> 48:27.255
-How many?
-400.

48:28.156 --> 48:32.356
-You are talking a big number.
-That's showtime. This ain't the WNBA.

48:33.156 --> 48:35.557
I'm thinking with these features,
this brand...

48:35.656 --> 48:38.756
I can get, maybe, $350 each at retail.

48:38.856 --> 48:41.455
-All right, cool.
-Nope, not cool.

48:41.555 --> 48:42.556
$500.

48:43.555 --> 48:46.355
Yeah, I've been calling
some of the local chain stores.

48:46.455 --> 48:48.355
You know, Best Buy, Circuit City.

48:48.455 --> 48:52.056
This model goes for $550,
$500 when they're on sale.

48:52.856 --> 48:55.655
Okay, $500.

48:56.255 --> 48:59.555
-Times 400 units, that comes to--
-That's $200,000.

49:00.754 --> 49:02.255
What are you looking for?

49:02.455 --> 49:06.055
Twenty percent. There's three of us.

49:07.054 --> 49:08.855
I want a woman with thin ankles.

49:08.955 --> 49:12.254
But I'm going to go home tonight,
and there's going to be my wife.

49:12.354 --> 49:15.554
Eight percent. $16,000.

49:15.854 --> 49:19.054
That's over $5,000 apiece
for you and your friends.

49:20.953 --> 49:23.554
$20,000. Upfront.

49:27.354 --> 49:29.054
Because I like you.

49:29.653 --> 49:32.653
Look at that.
It's a Kodak moment in the house.

49:37.554 --> 49:40.053
I got to run this by my people.

49:40.153 --> 49:42.653
They okay it, I'm going to give you a call.

49:43.753 --> 49:45.153
All right, cool.

49:52.452 --> 49:54.353
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

49:55.852 --> 49:59.452
You gonna insult my ace,
you check-and-raise piece of shit?

49:59.552 --> 50:03.552
-Fuck you, Augie, see it or fold.
-I'll see it and raise you back.

50:04.352 --> 50:06.551
-Talk to me, Augie.
-Ten-hut.

50:11.252 --> 50:12.851
Where's the lieutenant?

50:13.052 --> 50:16.251
He's on the street.

50:33.250 --> 50:36.749
I'm not a politician.
I wouldn't even know how to count votes.

50:37.250 --> 50:39.550
Maybe they know it's our time.

50:41.951 --> 50:42.949
Tony.

50:45.350 --> 50:47.750
Too soon to call you Commissioner?

50:48.951 --> 50:50.649
Excuse me one sec.

50:53.048 --> 50:55.549
-You sent me humps.
-Major?

50:55.649 --> 50:58.249
You sent me a detail of humps, Ervin.

50:58.349 --> 51:02.149
-We can discuss this tomorrow.
-No, I think we discuss it now...

51:02.449 --> 51:05.550
or I'm gonna walk in there and tell Santoni...

51:05.650 --> 51:08.249
to vote against this goddamn coronation.

51:08.349 --> 51:11.748
And more than that, I'm gonna talk
some shit to some of my friends...

51:11.848 --> 51:14.548
about what happened
at the end of the Barksdale case.

51:14.648 --> 51:15.649
You hear me on that?

51:15.749 --> 51:18.948
The Barksdale case
was a successful prosecution.

51:19.048 --> 51:21.848
Up until our people
tried to chase the cash, maybe.

51:21.948 --> 51:26.048
We have a quorum, I believe.
Council members can take their seats now.

51:29.247 --> 51:32.948
Tell you what, Deputy.
You probably still got enough votes...

51:33.048 --> 51:35.448
but I can make it uglier than you want it.

51:35.548 --> 51:36.848
What do you want, Stan?

51:36.948 --> 51:41.447
I want a real detail,
with real police and a real unit commander.

51:41.547 --> 51:43.047
Fine, done.

51:43.147 --> 51:45.347
Give me that black lieutenant
that did Barksdale.

51:45.447 --> 51:48.747
Daniels put in his papers.
He's gone, out the door.

51:48.847 --> 51:53.347
Did he meet the pension board yet?
I suggest you talk to the man.

51:53.548 --> 51:56.246
-I'll do what I can.
-Don't fuck with me, Erv.

51:56.346 --> 51:58.846
I got as many friends
here in the hall as you do.

51:58.946 --> 52:02.146
And with what I'm learning
about the Barksdale case...

52:02.246 --> 52:04.745
I got all kinds of shit I can throw.

52:20.346 --> 52:22.745
-Lock-down in 20.
-All right.

53:06.842 --> 53:08.643
What's up, lce?

53:10.743 --> 53:14.944
-You done with that Green Lantern?
-You can read it, but I want it back.

53:15.544 --> 53:18.142
-You hit Dee?
-Dee ain't up.

53:20.642 --> 53:24.042
Four hundred good cameras, Spiros.

53:26.942 --> 53:28.242
Who brought them in?

53:28.342 --> 53:33.042
The young stevedore, Niko,
and that idiot cousin of his.

53:39.242 --> 53:41.242
And I think he uses, too.

53:42.842 --> 53:44.141
Stefanos.

53:47.141 --> 53:49.741
I don't give a damn nothing about him.

53:49.841 --> 53:53.141
Listen, I'm paying 10 cents
on the dollar for the cameras.

53:53.241 --> 53:55.641
We're going to clear $180,000.

53:56.441 --> 53:58.841
-What about Niko?
-He's smart.

54:01.540 --> 54:03.041
Make the deal.

54:09.741 --> 54:12.140
What the hell's wrong with you tonight?

54:12.240 --> 54:14.439
-What?
-You're acting normal.

54:15.740 --> 54:19.940
You know what, Dolores?
I made money today.

54:20.040 --> 54:22.039
Yeah? What ship was in?

54:24.939 --> 54:25.939
Hey, Zig.

54:28.939 --> 54:30.939
Shot and a beer, Dolores.

54:32.039 --> 54:34.340
Frank Sobotka says I needed it.

54:42.038 --> 54:43.239
Thanks.

54:53.639 --> 54:57.337
-What's this?
-Your change. Or so says Frank Sobotka.

55:02.237 --> 55:04.637
-Sure?
-It ain't mine, for Christ's sake.

55:04.737 --> 55:07.638
If you don't take it, someone else is gonna.

55:18.237 --> 55:20.337
Your pop's a good man, Zig.

56:03.534 --> 56:05.335
Yo, up here!

56:22.534 --> 56:24.134
T.C., what's up?

56:25.833 --> 56:27.533
What's going on?

56:27.633 --> 56:31.833
-They falling out, four that I seen.
-What?

56:37.632 --> 56:39.133
What the fuck is going on?

56:39.233 --> 56:41.733
Bad package. Hot shots.

56:42.305 --> 56:48.200
