Britain's Got Talent

05:00.742 --> 05:02.421

05:02.422 --> 05:06.741
There have been far too many
below-average variety acts,

05:35.742 --> 05:38.101
no greater innovation has been made

05:38.102 --> 05:40.421

33:24.730 --> 33:26.729
Elizabeth.

33:26.730 --> 33:28.729
<font color="#11FF11">Elizabeth...?</font>

33:28.730 --> 33:29.730
Just Elizabeth.

33:29.731 --> 33:33.729
<font color="#11FF11">Why have you come on</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Britain's Got Talent?</font>

33:33.730 --> 33:35.729
Because I want to show
you something special,

33:35.730 --> 33:38.729
and try and make
the impossible possible.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.729
AUDIENCE: Oooooh!

33:40.730 --> 33:43.730
<font color="#11FF11">Well, the stage is yours, Elizabeth.</font>

33:53.930 --> 33:57.729
Theatres of London's West End...

33:57.730 --> 34:01.410
It's said to be haunted
by many ghosts.

34:02.930 --> 34:08.728
In 1919, the great Harry Houdini
appeared on stage,

34:08.730 --> 34:10.929
and offered a large cash sum

34:10.929 --> 34:15.250
for anyone who could prove
the existence of them.

34:17.730 --> 34:21.728
Amanda, I'd like you to take
this journal in your left hand,

34:21.730 --> 34:23.728
and I'd like you to come with me.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.248
GASPS
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm scared!</font>

34:25.250 --> 34:27.570
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm scared!</font>

34:35.730 --> 34:39.409
Legends have said
that spirits departed

34:39.409 --> 34:43.730
walk the halls and stalls
of the theatres of London.

34:44.730 --> 34:47.728
It is said to be good luck to see
ghosts for a performer.

34:47.730 --> 34:51.730
For others... not so much.

34:55.570 --> 34:56.730
She looks scared.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.730
<font color="#00FFFF">(Oh, my God! Where are we going?)</font>

35:06.730 --> 35:08.729
<font color="#FFFF00">That's under the stage.</font>

35:08.730 --> 35:09.730
ELECTRIC FIZZLING

35:09.731 --> 35:11.250
AMANDA GASPS

35:15.730 --> 35:18.570
Amanda, please take a seat.

35:24.730 --> 35:27.729
These photographs are of people

35:27.730 --> 35:31.730
who have lived and died
over 100 years ago.

35:34.730 --> 35:36.730
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm kinda creeped out!</font>

35:38.930 --> 35:41.730
Can you hold out your left hand
like this?

35:44.410 --> 35:47.729
Now, in a moment, I want you
to count these photographs,

35:47.730 --> 35:51.770
face down onto the table,
one at a time.

35:54.730 --> 35:59.249
When you place them down, you're
going to feel a connection to one.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.729
When you feel that connection,
I want you to stop,

36:01.730 --> 36:05.730
and to place that photograph
face down into this cigar box.

36:30.730 --> 36:34.729
Look at the photographs.
Each and every one is different.

36:34.730 --> 36:39.089
But you were drawn to one,
and you don't know why. <font color="#00FFFF">No.</font>

36:39.090 --> 36:42.730
Open the cigar box, and take out
the photograph that you chose.

36:43.730 --> 36:46.730
Turn it over and read out
what it says.

36:49.730 --> 36:51.730
<font color="#00FFFF">"Agatha Turner, 1860."</font>

36:53.730 --> 36:58.730
Before this all began, I gave you
a journal that's over 100 years old.

36:59.730 --> 37:01.729
Open the page I've bookmarked,

37:01.730 --> 37:04.730
and read out the paragraph
that I've circled in red.

37:06.930 --> 37:09.729
<font color="#00FFFF">"Miss Turner was born in the 1800s.</font>

37:09.730 --> 37:12.729
<font color="#00FFFF">"She loved visiting the West End</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be entertained.</font>

37:12.730 --> 37:15.249
<font color="#00FFFF">"She tragically died in 1860,</font>

37:15.250 --> 37:20.730
<font color="#00FFFF">"and her ghost is said to haunt</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the theatres that she once loved."</font>

37:26.410 --> 37:29.730
Amanda, this moment
was always meant to be.

37:31.730 --> 37:33.090
Look over your left shoulder.

37:35.730 --> 37:37.730
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

37:39.730 --> 37:43.410
SCREAMING

37:45.730 --> 37:47.249
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh!</font>

37:47.250 --> 37:49.730
AMANDA SCREAMS

37:51.730 --> 37:54.929
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my </font><font color="#11FF11">BLEEP! BLEEP!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to go home!</font>

37:54.930 --> 37:59.730
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</font>

38:02.730 --> 38:04.729
APPLAUSE

38:04.730 --> 38:06.729
<font color="#FFFF00">How did she do that?</font>

38:06.730 --> 38:08.730
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

38:14.730 --> 38:17.730
AMANDA WHIMPERS

38:21.730 --> 38:25.410
SCREAMS

38:27.410 --> 38:29.569
<font color="#FFFF00">How did she switch back to her?!</font>

38:29.570 --> 38:31.730
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:41.730 --> 38:43.730
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought I was gonna start crying!</font>

38:46.730 --> 38:50.729
<font color="#FFFF00">It was the most scary act</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we've ever had on the show,</font>

38:50.730 --> 38:52.730
<font color="#FFFF00">and I want to see more!</font>

38:54.570 --> 38:56.930
<font color="#00FFFF">It was horrific, and brilliant.</font>

38:58.250 --> 39:02.730
<font color="#11FF11">Simon? </font>Amazing.
I mean, really amazing.

39:03.730 --> 39:06.409
David, what did you think?
<font color="#11FF11">I was seriously spooked.</font>

39:06.410 --> 39:08.730
<font color="#11FF11">So I'm gonna kick this off</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with a yes.</font>

39:09.730 --> 39:11.729
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, it's a yes from me!</font>

39:11.730 --> 39:13.729
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a yes from me!</font>

39:13.730 --> 39:16.569
You've got four yeses!

39:16.570 --> 39:18.729
<font color="#FFFF00"># And I'm feeling good... #</font>

39:18.730 --> 39:21.250
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:25.730 --> 39:27.729
<font color="#11FF11">Are we all safe now?</font>

39:27.730 --> 39:29.729
The night's not over yet.

39:29.730 --> 39:32.730
<font color="#FFFF00">What?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">The night's not over.</font>

39:35.730 --> 39:37.730
SCREAMING

39:40.730 --> 39:44.730
# Does that make me crazy... #

39:45.553 --> 39:49.552
# Baby love
My baby love

39:49.553 --> 39:53.834
# I need ya
Oh, how I need ya... #

39:53.836 --> 39:55.835
I've got a little girl now.
She's two-and-a-half.

39:55.836 --> 39:58.835
The terrible twos, it is a thing,
honestly.

39:58.836 --> 40:00.835
<font color="#FFFF00">What time does she go to bed</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on a school night?</font>

40:00.836 --> 40:03.835
<font color="#00FFFF">She's in bed, she's in bed, look!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi, Lex.</font>

40:03.836 --> 40:06.835
<font color="#11FF11">Britain's Got Talent!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Britain's Got Talent!</font>

40:06.836 --> 40:09.835
<font color="#FFFF00">All right! Guys, guys!</font>

40:09.836 --> 40:11.835
<font color="#00FFFF">So you're here, you ready to do it?</font>

40:11.836 --> 40:13.835
I'm ready to rumble!
<font color="#00FFFF">Come on!</font>

40:13.836 --> 40:15.675
<font color="#FFFF00">"Ready to rumble."</font>
I had to!

40:15.676 --> 40:17.835
<font color="#FFFF00">It's all right, you go for it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't do that one!</font>

40:17.836 --> 40:19.835
<font color="#FFFF00">Best of luck, darling.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It's all yours.</font>

40:19.836 --> 40:22.835
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:22.836 --> 40:24.836
<font color="#FFFF00">Whooo!</font>

40:27.836 --> 40:29.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello, my love. Who are you?</font>

40:29.196 --> 40:31.835
My name's Siobhan, Siobhan Phillips.

40:31.836 --> 40:35.195
I am 42. I know I don't look it!

40:35.196 --> 40:36.835
LAUGHTER

40:36.836 --> 40:38.195
And I'm from Wakefield.

40:38.196 --> 40:39.836
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
<font color="#11FF11">Whoo!</font>

40:40.836 --> 40:43.835
<font color="#FFFF00">Yorkshire! </font><font color="#11FF11">Yorkshire! Yorkshire!</font>

40:43.836 --> 40:44.836
<font color="#00FFFF">Siobhan, what is the big dream?</font>

40:44.837 --> 40:46.835
I've been a performer
for a long time,

40:46.836 --> 40:49.835
and I'd love it if I had a venue

40:49.836 --> 40:51.835
where people have paid
to come and see me.

40:51.836 --> 40:52.836
Do you know what I mean?

40:52.837 --> 40:54.835
<font color="#00FFFF">I do know what you mean!</font>
That'd be great.

40:54.836 --> 40:56.835
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:56.836 --> 40:58.836
OK, good luck.

40:59.836 --> 41:01.836
<font color="#11FF11">Come on, girl!</font>

41:02.836 --> 41:06.835
So, I don't know if you've noticed,
but there's a pianoforte behind me.

41:06.836 --> 41:08.875
And I'm gonna sit down,
I'll get further away,

41:08.876 --> 41:10.835
but you'll still be able to see me.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.835
LAUGHTER

41:12.836 --> 41:14.835
What I've done, I've written a song,

41:14.836 --> 41:17.835
because a couple of years ago
I became a mum for the first time.

41:17.836 --> 41:19.835
I thought to myself,
I'll wait till I'm 40,

41:19.836 --> 41:22.835
I'm really old and tired,
and then I'll have a baby!

41:22.836 --> 41:24.835
MOUTHS SILENTLY

41:24.836 --> 41:26.875
SHE SIGHS

41:26.876 --> 41:28.835
So I wrote a song,
because they always say

41:28.836 --> 41:30.835
you should write songs
about subjects

41:30.836 --> 41:32.035
with which you are familiar,

41:32.036 --> 41:34.835
but I couldn't think of
a melody around cake, so...

41:34.836 --> 41:37.835
LAUGHTER

41:37.836 --> 41:41.835
I put a little song together.
I hope you like it. You can join in,

41:41.836 --> 41:44.515
but you won't know it,
cos I've written it, so...

41:44.516 --> 41:46.836
LAUGHTER

41:55.836 --> 41:58.835
# Had a baby at 40
What did I do?

41:58.836 --> 42:01.675
# I haven't slept since
I look 102

42:01.676 --> 42:04.835
# I've piled on weight
They say, "When is it due?"

42:04.836 --> 42:07.835
# I answer through gritted teeth
"She's just turned two"

42:07.836 --> 42:11.835
# I stand on plastic dinosaurs
Every single day

42:11.836 --> 42:14.515
# I dream of killing Peppa Pig
in a brutal way

42:14.516 --> 42:17.835
# I could strangle Mr Tumble
with his spotted bag

42:17.836 --> 42:20.835
# If it wasn't for Prosecco
I'd probably go mad... #

42:20.836 --> 42:21.836
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes!</font>

42:21.837 --> 42:24.195
# Kids, kids, kids
Oh, what fun

42:24.196 --> 42:26.875
# I sometimes wish
that I'd become a nun

42:26.876 --> 42:31.195
# Then she smiles at me
And I'd do it all again

42:31.196 --> 42:34.515
# But I think I'd skip
the toddler years

42:34.516 --> 42:38.835
# And push her out at ten

42:38.836 --> 42:41.835
# Push her out at ten

42:41.836 --> 42:44.835
# I'll never sleep again

42:44.836 --> 42:46.835
# I hate my life... #

42:46.836 --> 42:48.835
LAUGHTER

42:48.836 --> 42:50.835
# Going to the loo alone
would be a special treat... #

42:50.836 --> 42:51.836
<font color="#FFFF00">Right?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes!</font>

42:51.837 --> 42:54.835
# I'd love to read my Kindle
when I'm lying on the beach

42:54.836 --> 42:56.835
# I need to join the gym again
It pains me to admit

42:56.836 --> 43:00.835
# I accidentally put my bra
on backwards and it fits... #

43:00.836 --> 43:03.836
LAUGHTER

43:04.836 --> 43:07.035
# If I hear the question
"Why?" again

43:07.036 --> 43:08.835
# I think I might just scream

43:08.836 --> 43:11.835
# But at least she's far too young
to discuss the Brexit deal

43:11.836 --> 43:15.035
# And I only want what's best
for her to have a happy life

43:15.036 --> 43:19.835
# I'm keeping all my bits crossed
she'll be Eric Cowell's wife... #

43:19.836 --> 43:22.835
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:22.836 --> 43:24.835
# Aaaah! #

43:24.836 --> 43:29.836
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:30.836 --> 43:32.836
<font color="#00FFFF">She's great, we love her!</font>

AMANDA CHUCKLES

43:46.836 --> 43:48.835
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my gosh! I love that. David?</font>

43:48.836 --> 43:52.835
<font color="#11FF11">Wow! I think comedy songs are</font>
<font color="#11FF11">actually really hard to pull off,</font>

43:52.836 --> 43:55.835
<font color="#11FF11">to actually get real belly laughs</font>
<font color="#11FF11">throughout.</font>

43:55.836 --> 43:57.835
<font color="#11FF11">And you did,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">there were loads and loads of them.</font>

43:57.836 --> 43:59.196
<font color="#11FF11">You are a real talent.</font>

44:01.836 --> 44:04.835
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, he's right. You know?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">So seamless.</font>

44:04.836 --> 44:07.035
<font color="#FFFF00">The whole song was really relatable.</font>

44:07.036 --> 44:10.835
<font color="#FFFF00">Every parent is going, "Yes, I never</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get to use the toilet in peace!"</font>

44:10.836 --> 44:12.836
<font color="#FFFF00">You are brilliant!</font>

44:14.356 --> 44:15.835
Siobhan, you know,
what's interesting

44:15.836 --> 44:17.835
is I think that was very funny,

44:17.836 --> 44:19.835
and the fact that you can
poke fun at yourself as well

44:19.836 --> 44:21.835
is really endearing,

44:21.836 --> 44:23.835
and you kind of
just lit up the room.

44:23.836 --> 44:27.515
So may I give you, please,
your first yes?

44:27.516 --> 44:28.836
CHEERING

44:30.836 --> 44:33.836

<font color="#FFFF00">your third yes.</font>

44:37.876 --> 44:39.515
<font color="#11FF11">Well, obviously, yes!</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">I wanted her to get</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the Golden Buzzer.</font>

44:56.836 --> 44:58.835
That happened, didn't it?
That just happened!

44:58.836 --> 45:00.835
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, that was real life.</font>

45:00.836 --> 45:02.835
<font color="#FFFF00">That was real life.</font>

45:02.836 --> 45:04.035
I can't believe it.

45:04.036 --> 45:06.676
AUDIENCE CHANTING:
David! David! David!
