WEBVTT

00:04.628 --> 00:07.992
At Veridian Dynamics, scientific
research is second to none.

00:07.993 --> 00:12.323
Unfortunately, it seems sometimes that research
is conducted on the people who work here.

00:13.324 --> 00:14.444
What's all this?

00:14.445 --> 00:16.819
The company posted a
list of single employees

00:16.821 --> 00:19.654
they think should date each other
based on genetic compatibilty.

00:19.655 --> 00:21.192
Yep, that sounds about right.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.652
Wheee... love is in the air.

00:24.653 --> 00:27.212
Oh, gee. Genetic engineering is romantic

00:27.576 --> 00:29.611
That's why it's so often
used as a prom theme.

00:29.711 --> 00:32.112
They're only helping
hook up the single people.

00:32.113 --> 00:34.682
Once again, the marrieds
don't get to date.

00:34.683 --> 00:37.484
We just have to go home to
our cold, not-empty beds.

00:37.485 --> 00:39.753
Phil, just because they
used the word "wheee"

00:39.754 --> 00:42.389
doesn't mean it's a good thing.
Remember "wheee! It's pension rollbacks"?

00:42.390 --> 00:45.559
Oh, actually that was fun...

00:45.560 --> 00:48.062
Until they rolled back our pensions.

00:48.063 --> 00:50.097
So, Veronica, the company wants

00:50.098 --> 00:52.099
genetically compatible
employees to pair up?

00:52.100 --> 00:53.834
Is this the first step

00:53.835 --> 00:55.769
in trying to breed somebody tall enough

00:55.770 --> 00:57.838
to change that lightbulb in the lobby?

00:57.839 --> 01:00.107
Why do you always think
there's some dark motive

01:00.108 --> 01:02.610
behind everything the company does?

01:02.611 --> 01:05.045
Did a corporation once
touch you in a place

01:05.046 --> 01:07.381
- that made you uncomfortable?
- When they rolled back my pension,

01:07.382 --> 01:10.451
- I definitely felt it between the cheeks.
- Okay, fine. This whole thing is about money.

01:10.452 --> 01:13.520
- Happy now, Mr. Cynical?
- Well, technically, Mr. Cynical can't be happy.

01:13.521 --> 01:15.689
It's his power and his curse.

01:15.690 --> 01:17.591
The company has thousands of employees,

01:17.592 --> 01:20.194
and every year, hundreds
get married and have babies.

01:20.195 --> 01:22.496
If Veridian can ensure
the breeding couple

01:22.497 --> 01:24.565
is genetically compatible,
the company will save

01:24.566 --> 01:27.134
a huge amount of money on
health care for their offspring.

01:27.135 --> 01:29.637
So to save money, the
company's getting involved

01:29.638 --> 01:32.172
in people's sex lives?
They may regret that,

01:32.173 --> 01:34.441
like when they tried to
replace food in the cafeteria

01:34.442 --> 01:37.578
- with those nutrition pellets.
- Unlike eating those pellets, this is not a mandate.

01:37.579 --> 01:39.279
Anything that starts
with the word "wheee"

01:39.280 --> 01:41.315
is just a fun suggestion...

01:41.316 --> 01:43.517
like the constitution
and "wheee" the people.

01:45.754 --> 01:49.056
This sucks. Having my
name on that dating board

01:49.057 --> 01:52.192
is like announcing to the whole
floor, "ooh, look at Linda.

01:52.193 --> 01:54.895
What a loser. She's
so single and alonely."

01:54.896 --> 01:58.065
- Alone. Not lonely. I'm fine.
- I know. The whole thing is crazy.

01:58.066 --> 02:01.005
Who does the company think it is,
telling us who to boff? This is America.

02:01.626 --> 02:04.538
We fought the British over our right
to boff. They wanted us to shag.

02:04.539 --> 02:06.140
Ugh, I'm not even gonna
look at that stupid list.

02:06.141 --> 02:09.076
- Good. Me neither.
- They don't think we're compatible.

02:09.077 --> 02:11.945
- I know. I saw that.
- The thing is, if I don't do it,

02:11.946 --> 02:12.928
everyone else is gonna hook up,

02:12.929 --> 02:16.636
- and then I'll look alonely again. I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not doing it.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.637
So we both won't do it.

02:18.387 --> 02:20.187
- Good. It's a deal.
- They can take our loneliness

02:20.188 --> 02:22.100
when they pry it from
our cold, sad hands.

02:28.663 --> 02:33.000
Is that the super-fast-growing
moss for the NASA project?

02:33.001 --> 02:35.636
Yes. I left the lid off
the containment vessel,

02:35.637 --> 02:38.439
and it spread everywhere. We'd
better make it less aggressive.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.441
It's supposed to feed astronauts,

02:40.442 --> 02:42.409
not feed on astronauts.

02:42.410 --> 02:44.078
I've been called up to
Veronica's office so I can listen

02:44.079 --> 02:46.814
to her yell at me about
violating containment procedures.

02:46.815 --> 02:49.683
Hey, the company sent me an e-mail
about the genetic matchmaking.

02:50.037 --> 02:54.254
Looks like they didn't forget
the married people after all.

02:54.255 --> 02:56.390
"Congratulations, Dr.
Myman. Based on your DNA,

02:56.391 --> 02:58.292
the company is offering you a free..."

02:58.293 --> 03:01.428
double clicking... "Vasectomy"?

03:01.429 --> 03:04.832
- Why doesn't the company want me to reproduce?
- Sorry, Phil,

03:04.833 --> 03:07.334
I can't think about your
reproductive system right now.

03:07.335 --> 03:09.937
I have to go see Veronica,
and my own reproductive system

03:09.938 --> 03:13.273
has retreated like a turtle's
head up into my abdomen.

03:13.274 --> 03:14.441
Oh.

03:16.244 --> 03:20.314
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Lem, I want to talk to you about your sperm.

03:20.315 --> 03:22.750
I... I'm sorry. It got out
of its containment vessel,

03:22.751 --> 03:26.086
and it's extremely aggressive.
Wait. Did you say my...

03:26.087 --> 03:28.255
Sperm, yes. I want to freeze yours.

03:28.256 --> 03:30.958
It turns out you and I are the two

03:30.959 --> 03:33.694
most genetically compatible
people in the entire company.

03:33.695 --> 03:36.497
And while right now I'm neither
interested in raising a child

03:36.498 --> 03:39.933
nor in playing landlord for nine
months to a parasitic organism,

03:39.934 --> 03:41.835
I just want to keep my options open.

03:41.836 --> 03:44.104
You want to have my baby?

03:44.105 --> 03:46.774
Well, using your DNA
would only be my plan "e,"

03:46.775 --> 03:49.376
behind fall in love and breed, clone,

03:49.377 --> 03:51.278
take one of my sister's kids

03:51.279 --> 03:53.747
or rip out the whole works
and sail around the world.

03:53.748 --> 03:56.383
Well, you would look good on the deck of
the right ship... tanned, wind in your hair,

03:56.384 --> 03:59.253
- no ovaries.
- You have outstanding genes, Lem,

03:59.254 --> 04:01.355
too good for a gal to pass up.

04:01.356 --> 04:03.290
Your mother is a world-class scientist.

04:03.291 --> 04:06.193
Your father was the
first male supermodel.

04:06.194 --> 04:09.563
- I did my research.
- Boy, this is a lot to take in.

04:09.564 --> 04:11.165
- Excellent. Then it's settled.
- What?

04:11.166 --> 04:13.534
There's a man waiting for you with a cup

04:13.535 --> 04:15.869
on the eighth floor to take your sample.

04:15.870 --> 04:17.838
Just make sure it's the right man.

04:21.743 --> 04:25.112
Ugh. I know I sound
like a stand-up comic,

04:25.113 --> 04:27.614
but don't you hate it when someone
puts half a yogurt back in the fridge?

04:27.615 --> 04:30.784
Yes, and what is the
deal with airline food?

04:30.785 --> 04:33.187
- Why don't they serve it anymore?
- Hi, I'm Danielle.

04:33.188 --> 04:35.756
The company feels very strongly
that we should, "wheee..."

04:35.757 --> 04:38.859
- have unprotected sex with each other.
- Oh, you're that Danielle.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.795
You're... you're on
my compatibility list.

04:41.796 --> 04:44.731
- Yes, apparently we would make very cheap, durable children.
- I know. It's ridiculous.

04:44.732 --> 04:47.267
I mean, just because your
DNA matches mine doesn't mean

04:47.268 --> 04:49.870
you're gonna like pink's chili
dogs or that your favorite movie

04:49.871 --> 04:51.905
- is "Caddyshack."
- I swear I'm not hitting on you,

04:51.906 --> 04:54.408
but my favorite movie is "Caddyshack,"

04:54.409 --> 04:56.844
and if pink's chili dogs were
on the list, I would date them.

04:56.845 --> 05:00.347
- But, uh, the list is stupid, right?
- Oh, absolutely.

05:00.348 --> 05:03.250
So we definitely should not
do what it says and date.

05:03.251 --> 05:05.185
Yeah, although my cousin is stupid,

05:05.186 --> 05:07.921
and he once had a good suggestion.

05:07.922 --> 05:10.724
Excuse me. Are you Linda?

05:10.725 --> 05:13.026
- Yes.
- Okay, I'm Greg.

05:13.027 --> 05:16.563
- Uh, you're number one on my compatibility list.
- Oh, damn it.

05:16.564 --> 05:17.598
What?

05:17.599 --> 05:19.867
You're good-looking.

05:19.868 --> 05:22.102
Yeah, it bums me out,
too. Thanks a lot, God.

05:22.103 --> 05:25.172
No, it's just, I'm not
dating off that stupid list.

05:25.173 --> 05:27.107
A friend and I made a deal not to.

05:27.108 --> 05:29.776
We can't let the company
breed us like golden retrievers

05:29.777 --> 05:32.379
or we'll all end up with
weak hips and kennel cough.

05:32.380 --> 05:34.314
Yeah. I didn't want to do it either,

05:34.315 --> 05:36.483
but then I saw you,
and next thing I knew,

05:36.484 --> 05:39.286
I'm standing here wanting
to get to know you.

05:39.287 --> 05:41.188
Oh, crap. You're charming, too.

05:41.189 --> 05:43.190
Just get out.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.695
Ted, we need your help.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.131
- Guys, I'm in the middle of...
- Veronica's demanding my sperm.

05:51.132 --> 05:53.400
And the company wants to turn
my testicles into twin hermits

05:53.401 --> 05:55.769
with no conduit to the outside world.

05:55.770 --> 05:57.838
This is out of my area of expertise,

05:57.839 --> 06:00.340
so I will just see you later tonight.

06:00.341 --> 06:02.376
That's nice work, fellas.

06:02.377 --> 06:04.344
You know, that's why it wasn't called

06:04.345 --> 06:06.713
"Romeo and Juliet and Lem and Phil."

06:06.714 --> 06:09.917
- So what is going on?
- Me first. Veronica and I are a perfect genetic match,

06:09.918 --> 06:11.919
so she wants to bank my DNA

06:11.920 --> 06:13.954
but I don't want to have children.

06:13.955 --> 06:14.851
- I'm a dangerous bad boy.
- No, you're not.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.289
Shut up, Phil. It's not your turn yet.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.984
Plus, I don't want Veronica to
be the mother of my children.

06:18.985 --> 06:22.863
I might like my children, and she's the
least maternal person I have ever known.

06:22.864 --> 06:25.821
So Lem needs you to talk to
Veronica and tell her to back off

06:25.822 --> 06:30.671
- because he is a coward. Whew. Now me.
- Phil wants you to find out why the company

06:30.672 --> 06:32.673
doesn't want any more
Phils in the world.

06:32.674 --> 06:35.375
Oh, and he's also a coward. I tried to
get my medical records from the company,

06:35.376 --> 06:36.843
but they say they're confidential

06:36.844 --> 06:38.779
and can only be released to
other insurance companies,

06:38.780 --> 06:41.315
pharmaceutical reps,
suppliers of medical equipment

06:41.316 --> 06:43.250
and for some reason, the R.N.C.

06:43.251 --> 06:45.652
Okay, guys, relax. I
will take care of it.

06:45.653 --> 06:48.288
I will talk to Veronica. I will
get you your medical records.

06:48.289 --> 06:50.624
And then tonight, I will
rescue a young, beautiful lady

06:50.625 --> 06:53.527
from a Tedless existence.
Now back to work.

06:56.564 --> 06:59.199
This is why we draw pictures
of him as a superhero.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.336
He must never know about aqua-Ted.

07:02.337 --> 07:05.939
I did it. I stuck to our
pact, and I stood on principle.

07:05.940 --> 07:07.908
It was really hard, but I turned down

07:07.909 --> 07:09.977
this really good-looking,
charming guy who...

07:09.978 --> 07:12.179
Why are you backing away from me?

07:12.180 --> 07:14.648
What did you do, cri?

07:14.649 --> 07:16.650
You son of a bitch!

07:16.651 --> 07:19.586
Get out of my way.
Excuse me. Move, please.

07:19.587 --> 07:21.521
Move!

07:21.522 --> 07:24.825
Hi, Greg. Does tonight work for you?

07:31.355 --> 07:32.689
Lem.

07:32.690 --> 07:35.258
Oh! I've just gotta...

07:40.064 --> 07:42.799
Ted tells me you don't
want me to have your baby,

07:42.800 --> 07:44.734
and I shouldn't talk to you about it

07:44.735 --> 07:46.602
because it will make you uncomfortable.

07:46.603 --> 07:49.472
- Is that true?
- No, you never make me uncomfortable.

07:49.473 --> 07:51.240
Why would he say that?

07:51.241 --> 07:53.743
"I'm dying to do it" is
what he should have said.

07:53.744 --> 07:55.778
Good. Then get up to the eighth floor

07:57.381 --> 08:00.149
oh, as long as I'm here, what's going on

08:00.150 --> 08:02.251
with the edible moss project?

08:02.252 --> 08:05.521
- Well, we hit a little setback, and now I'm peeing.
- Please.

08:05.522 --> 08:08.091
I'm not interested in all the
little details of your life.

08:08.092 --> 08:09.959
The NASA guys are coming tomorrow.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.829
- Just make sure I have something to show them.
- Yeah.

08:12.830 --> 08:14.797
Then I came to Veridian four years ago.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.232
I like the people,

08:16.233 --> 08:18.167
but sometimes the company makes me feel

08:18.168 --> 08:20.603
so small and... and unimportant.

08:20.604 --> 08:22.939
Oh, man. I can totally relate to that.

08:22.940 --> 08:25.508
I used to steal creamer
out of the coffee room.

08:25.509 --> 08:28.378
I didn't even use it. I just
wanted to stand for myself

08:28.379 --> 08:31.247
and say hey, I'm here. You
don't control everything I do.

08:31.248 --> 08:33.850
That is awesome. I totally get that.

08:33.851 --> 08:37.253
- I have my own little way of acting out.
- Really?

08:37.254 --> 08:39.756
- Yeah.
- What is it?

08:39.756 --> 08:42.759
- No, you're gonna think it's strange.
- Oh, come on. I told you my thing.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.328
All right. Uh, twice a week after work,

08:45.329 --> 08:47.330
I put on a totally
realistic bear costume

08:47.331 --> 08:50.266
and hang out in the park.

08:50.267 --> 08:51.968
You what now?

08:51.969 --> 08:54.237
Yeah, it makes me feel powerful, mighty.

08:54.238 --> 08:55.972
I don't scare anyone.

08:55.973 --> 08:59.008
I sit in the bushes,
root around for berries.

08:59.009 --> 09:01.277
Ce I pushed on a camper...

09:01.278 --> 09:03.513
you know, just bear kind of stuff.

09:05.516 --> 09:08.117
I think that's great.

09:12.022 --> 09:14.390
My date with Danielle was fantastic...

09:14.391 --> 09:17.293
really fantastic, right up until...

09:17.294 --> 09:19.328
I love you.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.397
- I just blurted it out.
- Good God.

09:21.398 --> 09:24.300
You told a woman you loved
her on the first date?

09:24.301 --> 09:27.837
- That is so needy.
- I know. In the blink of an eye, I went from sexy to psychopath.

09:27.838 --> 09:30.273
It's just, I hadn't been
with a woman in a while.

09:30.274 --> 09:32.642
It was something I
used to say to my wife.

09:32.643 --> 09:34.477
You should always limit
what you say during sex

09:34.478 --> 09:36.112
to moaning and helpful tips.

09:36.113 --> 09:38.948
So did she say "I love you" back,

09:38.949 --> 09:41.417
- or were you the only crazy one in the bed?
- No, it was just me.

09:41.418 --> 09:45.221
But I covered for it, although
I don't know if I made it better.

09:48.058 --> 09:52.395
I love you... tah.

09:52.396 --> 09:53.930
You love Utah?

09:53.931 --> 09:56.365
Very much.

09:56.366 --> 10:00.670
Why would you say you love
Utah at this particular moment?

10:00.671 --> 10:02.572
It's... it's just, uh,

10:02.573 --> 10:05.374
Utah, it's a very
spiritual place for me.

10:05.375 --> 10:08.544
I go there in my head sometimes
during special moments...

10:08.545 --> 10:12.682
Sex, birth of my child. I've
even yelled it at ball games.

10:12.683 --> 10:15.318
Oh. Uh... Why Utah?

10:15.319 --> 10:19.188
Because... I'm from there.

10:19.189 --> 10:21.290
You are?

10:21.291 --> 10:24.460
Most of my family is from Utah.

10:24.461 --> 10:26.562
Yeah. Salt Lake City.
Where are you from?

10:26.563 --> 10:28.664
Not Salt Lake City.

10:28.665 --> 10:31.400
I'm from...

10:31.401 --> 10:34.136
I don't remember the name.

10:34.137 --> 10:37.006
You don't remember the
name of where you're from?

10:37.007 --> 10:39.609
Not the English name.

10:39.610 --> 10:41.844
What other name is there?

10:43.847 --> 10:46.048
The Indian name.

10:59.162 --> 11:02.598
- She used up the good one.
- Provo, Park City, Moab, Castleville, Cedar City...

11:02.599 --> 11:04.567
Yeah, it's easy to play "Jeopardy!"

11:04.568 --> 11:06.769
When you're at home in your living
room with all your clothes on.

11:06.770 --> 11:10.239
Ogden, Fruit Heights,
Ggoshen, Mayfield, Lewiston...

11:10.240 --> 11:12.475
- All right, I get it. You know Utah.
- You mean the beehive state?

11:12.476 --> 11:15.111
Anyway, once I started lying,
there was no going back.

11:15.112 --> 11:18.080
Before I knew it, I had
made up this whole story

11:18.081 --> 11:20.950
about my childhood growing
up on an Indian reservation.

11:20.951 --> 11:22.752
Oh, Ted.

11:22.753 --> 11:25.955
Wow, your grandfather sounds
like such a proud man...

11:25.956 --> 11:28.591
Trying to keep your culture alive.

11:28.592 --> 11:31.027
Hey, hey, what's your
word for grandfather?

11:37.834 --> 11:39.335
that means "goat,"

11:39.336 --> 11:42.505
which is why we no longer eat goat.

11:43.373 --> 11:45.441
What am I doing?

11:45.442 --> 11:48.110
The thing is, I want
to keep seeing Danielle.

11:48.111 --> 11:50.580
- I really like her.
- What's not to like?

11:50.581 --> 11:52.915
She's gullible and slept
with you on the first date.

11:52.916 --> 11:55.918
If her mom's not fat, I'd
say throw a ring on it.

11:55.919 --> 11:57.887
I'm gonna tell her the truth, but first,

11:57.888 --> 12:00.890
I need to spend time with her,
you know, just... just being me.

12:00.891 --> 12:02.725
Then when I come clean, this will all be

12:02.726 --> 12:05.361
- just that funny story about our first date.
- Yes, Ted, maybe yours

12:05.362 --> 12:07.363
will be the one Indian
story that ends haily.

12:07.364 --> 12:09.832
Listen, I still ven't
seen any edible moss,

12:09.833 --> 12:11.934
and NASA's coming this afternoon.

12:11.935 --> 12:13.903
Go light a fire under your nerds.

12:13.904 --> 12:15.705
I don't know where they are,

12:15.706 --> 12:18.608
but I'm sure you're
an excellent tracker.

12:21.778 --> 12:24.046
Hey, Ted-edict Arnold.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.082
How did your date go with Danielle?

12:26.083 --> 12:28.618
- Good. Really well.
- Oh, just really well?

12:30.087 --> 12:33.489
My date with Greg went
really, really well, so...

12:33.490 --> 12:36.592
- Ted.
- Danielle. Hey, you want to maybe grab some lunch later?

12:36.593 --> 12:38.894
Yeah, that sounds great.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

12:38.895 --> 12:43.032
- How do you say "lunch" in your language?
- Oh, that doesn't have to be our thing, does it?

12:43.033 --> 12:45.101
Oh, come on. It's such
a beautiful language.

12:45.102 --> 12:48.437
It's, um,
gin-yi-ay-

12:57.581 --> 13:00.683
You have your own language?

13:00.684 --> 13:04.086
It's not mine. I share
it with my people.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.821
And you have a people.

13:05.822 --> 13:08.124
She thinks I'm an Indian.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.959
Oh, goodness.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.095
Hey, Linda.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.263
Hey.

13:14.264 --> 13:17.433
I had a really, really
good time last night.

13:17.434 --> 13:20.770
Me, too. I told you so. Uh, this is Ted.

13:20.771 --> 13:22.805
He likes to pretend he's an Indian.

13:22.806 --> 13:24.974
Oh, cool. You ever pretend to stalk

13:24.975 --> 13:26.976
totally realistic-looking
large animals?

13:26.977 --> 13:30.746
That's funny. You're adorable.

13:30.747 --> 13:33.115
Yeah? Then why don't
we go out again tonight?

13:33.116 --> 13:35.017
Okay.

13:37.821 --> 13:41.190
Ooh, maybe we can go to the park.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.360
Phil, I'm having a bad day.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.029
Tell me you're almost done
with the edible moss project.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.765
Sorry, Ted. I am actively
disappointing you.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.768
I'm researching my family
tree to find out why Veridian

13:56.769 --> 13:59.004
doesn't want any more
Mymans in the world.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.907
Oh, yeah, that. I tried to
get your medical records,

14:01.908 --> 14:04.409
- and the company won't release 'em.
- I have my answer anyway.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.946
Turns out the entire Myman
family line is worthless.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.749
We have been hated throughout history.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.185
The English hunted Mymans for sport.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.220
The French used us
as building materials.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.990
The Russians had an expression...

14:17.991 --> 14:20.993
- "as useless as a stack of Mymans."
- Well, what about this medieval sect of warriors?

14:20.994 --> 14:23.495
"The screaming Mymans"...
that sound promising.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.464
They weren't warriors.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.233
The crusaders launched my
ancestors over castle walls

14:28.234 --> 14:31.069
- as ammunition.
- Oh, good, you're here.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.805
I need you to tell Veronica
that I don't want to give her

14:33.806 --> 14:35.774
- my baby ingredients.
- I already did.

14:35.775 --> 14:38.210
But then I untold her. I'm so weak.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.779
How can I ever look my sperm in the eye?

14:40.780 --> 14:43.382
At least you didn't lie to your
sperm about being an Indian.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.285
No, I did not. But once
when I was a teenager,

14:46.286 --> 14:48.587
I did abandon it at a bus stop.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.825
We have a scientist problem.

14:53.826 --> 14:57.362
God. I can't wait until they
invent their own replacents.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.464
Phil is freaking out. He needs
to see his medical records.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.401
Yeah, I noticed he was
acting a little odd earlier.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.442
Did you know that "turd"

15:10.443 --> 15:13.211
comes from the Gaelic word for Myman?

15:13.212 --> 15:16.448
Shh. I love this song.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.285
And you gotta back off Lem.

15:20.286 --> 15:23.155
What's going on with you
and this baby thing, anyway?

15:23.156 --> 15:27.059
I don't know. My stupid sister
just popped out another one.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.328
And I held it, and it
smelled really good.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.730
It was soft and squishy,
and for the briefest second,

15:31.731 --> 15:33.765
I didn't want to give it back.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.233
Part of that was because

15:35.234 --> 15:37.569
I don't like my sister
having things I don't have.

15:37.570 --> 15:41.139
But part of it was something else.

15:41.140 --> 15:44.276
Well, if that's what you want,
it'll happen for you someday.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.578
But right now, if you want Lem's moss,

15:46.579 --> 15:49.915
you gotta back off his sauce.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.284
Hey, Danielle. You ready for lunch?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.653
We could go to pink's,
grab some chili dogs.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.889
- This tie is ready for retirement.
- And I hate this dress. Let's do it.

15:57.890 --> 16:01.960
Hey, Ted. Do you know if that'
a fresh pot of aw-kay-how?

16:01.961 --> 16:05.664
Hi, I'm Linda. Ted's an Indian.
That's his word for coffee.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.666
He taught me his language.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.634
Lakota wa-glacka
oh-oosby wack-a-toonia.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.104
I just asked him what
he's doing is weekend.

16:12.105 --> 16:16.608
And he says, in his language...

16:16.609 --> 16:20.512
Wigloka netu-aken. Ley wah.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.214
Eh caso kah.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.750
Pilo-Maya.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.719
Really? Tennis again? I'm
sorry, I interrupted you.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.855
Please finish what you were saying.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.723
He-ah.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.059
Danielle's?

16:34.060 --> 16:36.028
He-ah?

16:36.029 --> 16:38.463
No, they look totally real to me.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.870
- Were you two just talking about my...
- No! No, no.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.072
See, the thing is, um, in my language,

16:47.073 --> 16:51.410
the word for tennis
ball is the same as...

16:51.411 --> 16:53.712
Ah, screw it. I'm not an Indian.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.680
I... I lied about the whole thing.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.616
Wait. W... what? You lied?

16:57.617 --> 17:00.152
Why... why would you do that?

17:00.153 --> 17:03.088
Because I accidentally said
"I love you" on our first date

17:03.089 --> 17:05.257
I... I didn't want you
to think I was needy.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.026
It... it just slipped out.
But if you think about it,

17:08.027 --> 17:10.462
it's about the sweetest
thing a guy can say.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.632
I mean, isn't that why
we're all here... love?

17:13.633 --> 17:16.835
Wait, wait, stop. The
headline here is you lied.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.703
Yeah.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.205
Plus, now I feel like
an idiot for believing

17:21.207 --> 17:25.676
anyone's word for horse
could be "climpe-clompety."

17:27.146 --> 17:32.350
I'm sorry. I love you!
Aah! What is wrong with me?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.458
Hello. I'm Philip Myman.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.493
I'm here for my free vasectomy.

17:41.494 --> 17:45.030
I believe I am also entitled
to a complimentary windbreaker.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.666
We're out of windbreakers.
Would you like a spos bottle?

17:47.667 --> 17:51.837
No, I got the sports bottle
when they rolled back my pension.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.772
Phil, this is crazy.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.675
Just because Veronica tells
you to get your ass up here

17:56.676 --> 17:58.977
doesn't mean you have
to go through with this.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.913
She can't have your things,
and she can't take my stuff.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.250
She would make a horrible
mom, and when she gets here,

18:05.251 --> 18:07.686
I'm going to tell her... I'm ready.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.088
- Relax. I talked to Ted. You're off the hook.
- Ted's a liar.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.290
Let's just get this surgery over with.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.861
- Then maybe you'll take me out and buy me a smoothie.
- We're not here for surgery.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.563
I need to see Phil
Myman's medical records.

18:18.564 --> 18:21.199
Oh, good. You have them
out. Give them to me.

18:21.200 --> 18:25.871
- I'm sorry, ma'am. These records are strictly confidential.
- This is my scientist,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.240
and you are making him very unhappy.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.041
And I can't have him unhappy.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.144
So you give me that file,

18:32.145 --> 18:34.880
because if I have to come
back there and get it myself,

18:34.881 --> 18:36.815
then you're gonna be
unhappy. Do you understand?

18:36.816 --> 18:38.583
Ma'am, I can't.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.452
Excellent. I was hoping you'd say that,

18:40.453 --> 18:44.489
because I haven't gone
balls-out crazy in a long time,

18:44.490 --> 18:49.728
- and it's my favorite kind of crazy.
-Wow. Look how fierce and protective she is.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.997
This must be how a baby lion feels

18:51.998 --> 18:54.132
when its mom yells at a receptionist

18:54.133 --> 18:56.535
to get its medical records.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.304
So now it looks like we
have ourselves a race.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.240
Can you lock that door
before I can get through it?

19:02.241 --> 19:05.143
You feeling lucky? Huh, receptionist?

19:12.084 --> 19:14.686
Run! I'm all bluff.

17:51.298 --> 17:54.000
So, for a pure clean, all
free clear is all you need.

Recommended by dermatologists...

19:17.451 --> 19:19.318
Seeing Veronica ing
so protective of Phil

19:19.386 --> 19:21.487
made Lem realize she did
have maternal instincts,

19:21.555 --> 19:24.657
and that would make her a great mom.

19:24.725 --> 19:27.660
Veronica, here's a cup of
my sperm. You've earned it.

19:27.728 --> 19:30.563
Lem, you remember the guys from NASA?

19:33.033 --> 19:35.101
Gentlemen.

19:38.071 --> 19:40.473
And after looking at
his medical records,

19:40.540 --> 19:42.808
Phil was relieved to
find out the real reason

19:42.876 --> 19:45.011
the company didn't
want him to reproduce.

19:45.078 --> 19:46.979
My sperm count is off the charts!

19:47.047 --> 19:49.649
I'm so prolific, the
amount of kids I could have

19:49.716 --> 19:52.118
would cost them a
fortune in health care.

19:52.185 --> 19:54.086
The Mymans weren't useless.
They were just plentiful.

19:54.154 --> 19:58.691
Your people are like the edible
space moss of the human race.

19:58.759 --> 20:01.193
And I realized, I haven't
been with a lot of women

20:01.261 --> 20:03.429
since my wife, so maybe
I am a little needy,

20:03.497 --> 20:05.331
and I need to get out
more...  a lot more,

20:05.399 --> 20:07.700
and learn about Utah, just in case.

20:07.768 --> 20:10.970
Hey, Ted. Pilo-Maya.

20:11.038 --> 20:13.339
That means I'm sorry I
messed things up for you

20:13.407 --> 20:15.408
with Danielle,

20:15.475 --> 20:18.010
but I was pissed you dated
someone from that stupid list

20:18.078 --> 20:19.912
when we had a deal we wouldn't.

20:19.980 --> 20:22.148
But ruining your love life
was a douchey thing to do.

20:22.215 --> 20:24.150
Pilo-Maya... a simple
word for a complex idea.

20:24.217 --> 20:26.819
Oh, that's okay. Hey, I'm
the one who lied to Danielle.

20:26.887 --> 20:28.821
But at least you got something promising

20:28.889 --> 20:31.090
- going with that Greg guy.
- Yeah, about that.

20:31.158 --> 20:33.125
Last night animal control shot him

20:33.193 --> 20:35.494
- with a tranquilizer in the park.
- What?

20:35.562 --> 20:37.730
Yeah, he was kind of dressed as a bear

20:37.798 --> 20:40.833
and pushing on a van
