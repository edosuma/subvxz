WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.480
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.524 --> 00:04.395
"To all true
Children of Liberty,

00:04.439 --> 00:06.528
who believe
this country is ours.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.965
We must resist
the alien scourge."

00:09.009 --> 00:11.663
If people feeling inferior
is what makes them
join these hate groups,

00:11.707 --> 00:14.144
then we could just
level the playing field.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.320
Did the Harun

00:16.364 --> 00:17.930
It made the heart invincible.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.323
I want to move forward
with the Harun-El protocol.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.846
We're gonna need
a human subject.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.111
They took my baby, man.

00:24.154 --> 00:27.157
Sorry, Fi.
I've got to do it my way.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.898
I got connected with
some Children of Liberty.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.160
Tom, nice to meet you, bro.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.162
I don't have direct access
to Agent Liberty.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.859
But I can connect you
with people who do.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.950
All units respond
to a hostage situation

00:37.994 --> 00:39.778
at the alien
fission rod factory.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.134
Lower your gun
and get down on the ground.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.398
Or I can't promise
you'll walk out of here.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.582
You're safe now.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.194
Good job.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.632
So what did your partners
want with the fission rods?

01:07.676 --> 01:09.721
Go ahead,
tell her what you told me.

01:09.765 --> 01:10.983
I don't know anything.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.768
Hey, hey, that is not
how we do things.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.206
Look, you're getting
in the back of
a police car anyway

01:16.250 --> 01:17.512
so just tell us the truth.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.688
I swear
I don't know any more.

01:19.731 --> 01:23.213
I said I wanted to help
and they gave me two options.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.563
I could show up here
and steal some fission rods,

01:25.607 --> 01:27.739
or hang out, waiting
for some cargo shipment.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.266
We're done here.

01:34.137 --> 01:37.749
Hey, partner. Wait up.

01:37.793 --> 01:41.144
Look, I appreciate
what you're doing,
but I can take it from here.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.755
Look, Agent Liberty
took everything from me.

01:43.799 --> 01:47.150
I will do anything
to see him brought
to justice. Anything.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.544
Just let me help.
I'm resourceful.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.459
I tracked them here,
didn't I?

01:51.502 --> 01:53.243
I'll call you
if I find anything.

02:05.995 --> 02:10.652
I apologize for the blindfold.
A necessary precaution,
you understand.

02:10.695 --> 02:11.870
Yeah, I get it.

02:13.307 --> 02:14.873
But I'm no threat to you.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.876
I came here
on my own accord.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.358
To talk to you.

02:21.402 --> 02:24.318
To listen.
I'm prepared to hear
your side of the story.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.711
I mean, obviously,
you have an agenda,
but why?

02:27.364 --> 02:29.540
There has to be something.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.761
The core of your anger,
something that's
happened to you.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.851
Something did happen
to me, Mr. Olsen.

02:35.894 --> 02:40.508
I saw men struggling
to remain relevant,
to provide for their family,

02:40.551 --> 02:44.860
I saw human beings
being treated
less than they deserve.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.341
Less than exceptional.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.343
Surely, there has to be
a part of you that can find

02:49.386 --> 02:51.388
a commonality between
aliens and humans.

02:51.432 --> 02:56.306
We just want good, safe lives
for our loved ones.

02:56.350 --> 03:00.876
No, we're not here to talk
about my empathy,
or lack thereof, for aliens.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.269
Okay, you tell me.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.358
What am I writing?

03:04.401 --> 03:06.360
You won't be writing anything.

03:06.403 --> 03:08.449
I'm giving you an opportunity

03:08.492 --> 03:10.625
to step in front
of the camera for once,

03:10.668 --> 03:14.194
to be the story,
to galvanize and to inspire.

03:14.237 --> 03:18.807
Because Guardian stands
for everything that
my followers strive for.

03:19.547 --> 03:22.158
Human exceptionalism.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.422
You want me
to inspire your followers?

03:25.466 --> 03:28.295
And how exactly
do you want me to do that?

03:28.338 --> 03:30.732
I want you
to destroy something.

03:30.775 --> 03:34.257
A monument,
something that stands against
everything we believe in.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.867
I don't tear things down.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.479
That's not my style.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.961
I get it, you're not
a willing participant yet.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.615
But you will be.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.443
I believe in you, Mr. Olsen.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.323
The fission rods
were just delivered.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.281
What about the rest?
It's set?

03:58.325 --> 03:59.848
-Yeah.
-Good.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.633
Then the men
we lost on Thanksgiving
will be avenged.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.548
And by tomorrow night,

04:05.245 --> 04:06.768
Supergirl will be dead.

04:17.648 --> 04:20.564
Miss Luthor,
the subject's here.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.741
-He's early.
-Well, he's eager
to get started.

04:23.785 --> 04:27.876
He's a real nice guy.
He's got nice green eyes,
like yours.

04:27.919 --> 04:31.836
Eve, doing experiments of
this nature on a human subject
is extremely serious.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.187
I've had qualms about
even proceeding. You are
not making this any easier.

04:35.231 --> 04:38.147
I'm so sorry.
Of course.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.496
You have to proceed.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.803
My cousin's in hospice.

04:41.846 --> 04:44.588
Metastasized cancer,
she's got two little girls.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.591
You give those kids
their mother back

04:47.635 --> 04:50.638
and just imagine
all the other families
that you'd rescue.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.814
Not to mention
saving our country.

04:52.857 --> 04:56.296
If you level the playing field
and make humans super,

04:56.339 --> 04:58.646
you could be preventing
another civil war.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.735
Have you prepared
the subject?

05:01.213 --> 05:02.345
Yes. His name--

05:02.389 --> 05:04.391
No. No,
don't tell me his name.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.219
We'll refer to him
as subject 0331.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.584
Well, you must be
the lab tech.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.849
I'm your rat. Name's--

05:27.892 --> 05:32.680
Subject 0331, male,
brown hair, green eyes,
approximately 5'9".

05:39.600 --> 05:41.384
Three-inch scar
on the left rear flank.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.560
Hockey injury.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.997
Buffalo boys.
Can't trust us on the ice.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.391
I assume you've read
and considered the conditions
of the experiment

05:48.435 --> 05:50.524
before you signed
the contract.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.265
Feel free to look it over, but
I will need your thumbprint
to make it binding.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.355
Yeah, wait, by conditions,
you mean this part, right?

05:55.398 --> 05:58.793
"I, the subject,
understand and acknowledge
the full range of risks

05:58.836 --> 06:03.493
including, but not limited to
a 15% chance
of expiration."

06:05.495 --> 06:08.933
"Expiration" as in death,
right, lab tech?

06:08.977 --> 06:11.022
That makes me sound
like a carton of milk.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.459
If you're uncomfortable
with the terms, you can
just get dressed and leave.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.722
No, no, no.
I'm just messing with you.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.724
Of course, I understand
the terms. It's just...

06:17.768 --> 06:19.596
Why the soft

06:19.640 --> 06:21.424
I mean,
it's kind of like when
everyone would say,

06:21.468 --> 06:23.731
"I'm so sorry
your brother passed."

06:24.296 --> 06:26.298
Passed what, gas?

06:26.342 --> 06:27.474
Passed his driver's test?

06:27.517 --> 06:31.129
No, he didn't pass, lady.
He freaking died.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.523
Dead, as in a doornail.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.441
Anyways, I digress.
It's a thing I do.
I'm totally in.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.312
-Here is my thumbprint.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.492
Can I see your arm, please?

06:45.535 --> 06:47.450
I suggest my left.

06:47.494 --> 06:51.367
The ad for this gig
made a pretty big deal of
secrecy of the whole thing.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.936
But, uh, seeing as
how I'm putting
my life on the line,

06:54.979 --> 06:56.938
well, I'd love
to know what it's for.

06:56.981 --> 06:59.375
Well, you must
know the scientist
pretty well, right?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.637
Can you tell me
what he's up to?

07:01.508 --> 07:03.292
It's the advancement
of science.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.554
You're tough.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.905
But under all that ice,
there's a heart.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.821
I can tell.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.171
So will I ever get to meet
the man behind all this?

07:14.042 --> 07:16.958
You have met him.
I'm the scientist.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.138
Hey, I have to
show you something.

07:23.181 --> 07:24.269
Okay, in a minute.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.532
Brainy, I need you
to track--

07:25.575 --> 07:27.185
Missing alien fission rods?
Already on it.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.361
Great. And I need to track
any rogue cargo ship--

07:29.405 --> 07:32.539
Gentlemen, you are watching
The Lockdown
with Ben Lockwood.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.105
What is that man
doing on TV?

07:34.149 --> 07:36.194
I told you I needed
to show you something.

07:38.588 --> 07:41.199
And I'm sorry to say we're going to start tonight's show on a very somber note.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.201
Because on Thanksgiving night,

07:43.245 --> 07:45.160
five men peacefully protesting

07:45.203 --> 07:48.598
the alien takeover
of their home planet
went missing.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.427
Roaches think they can
blow us out of the water
whenever they want.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.517
They see Supergirl
flying around, rounding up
innocent people.

07:54.561 --> 07:55.605
They're blaming me!

07:55.649 --> 07:57.564
Is Supergirl a hero,

07:57.607 --> 08:00.654
or is she the seed
that may very well

08:00.697 --> 08:03.395
'cause the eradication
of the human race?

08:03.439 --> 08:05.006
-Hey.

08:05.049 --> 08:08.009
Hey, you saved hundreds
of people on Thanksgiving.

08:08.052 --> 08:11.229
And we don't even know
if aliens were involved
in the disappearances.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.362
-We're still investigating.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.233
Hang on.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.713
J'onn, what's happening?

08:16.757 --> 08:18.715
Hi, I just got a call
from Manchester Black,

08:18.759 --> 08:20.891
said you two were
working on something?

08:20.935 --> 08:22.197
He wanted me
to give you a message.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.894
Something about
a cargo shipment?

08:23.938 --> 08:26.549
Really?
Send me the details.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.942
Will do.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.603
Tom?

08:36.646 --> 08:38.735
I'm so sorry I got you
involved in all this.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.128
They lied to me.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.259
I thought they were
gonna give you an interview.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.913
I didn't know
they were gonna use you.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.353
My gauntlet.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.929
Come on,
we don't have a lot of time.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.295
Welcome to Earth.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.254
You are about to be
processed for immigration.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.256
The island will
dampen your powers,

09:21.299 --> 09:24.085
but rest assured,
they'll return
as soon as you leave.

09:24.128 --> 09:25.608
Earth is a friendly place,

09:25.652 --> 09:27.131
you are safe here.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.569
Welcome to Shelley Island.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.619
Shelley Island?

09:36.663 --> 09:39.100
I thought this place
was shut down after
President Marsdin resigned.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.015
It was. That's why
it's the perfect place

09:41.058 --> 09:43.104
for the Children of Liberty
to gather.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.367
James Olsen has escaped.
Search the island.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.108
No boats on or off.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.805
Come on,
the boat's this way.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.596
[Children of Liberty
yelling indistinctly]

09:57.727 --> 09:59.120
Go! James, go!

09:59.686 --> 10:00.904
Go!

10:03.907 --> 10:05.126
Earth traitor.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.824
Stop, stop, stop.
Wait, wait, wait!

10:10.610 --> 10:11.872
I'll do whatever you want.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.091
Just don't hurt him.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.662
You see?

10:19.706 --> 10:22.622
I knew
you'd heed the call.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.893
Psst.

10:32.936 --> 10:33.981
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.765
Thanks for the tip.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.593
So what's this code
you've cracked?

10:38.289 --> 10:39.421
Follow me.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.338
Once I realized
that little weasel
in the energy factory

10:43.381 --> 10:46.297
gave us everything we needed,
the rest was easy.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.388
DISL label.

10:50.432 --> 10:53.348
International standard
codes for ID
and freight containers.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.481
I nicked the logs from
the shipyard foreman,
did a little cross-referencing

10:56.525 --> 10:58.092
and found our prize.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.834
So, shall we see
what's behind door number one?

11:05.969 --> 11:07.188
It's empty.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.624
And freezing.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.671
Whatever was shipped in here
was kept at sub-zero.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.455
Yeah, now it's gone
without a trace.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.935
Maybe not.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.351
It's part of
a shipping label.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.138
Manchester?

11:44.181 --> 11:45.705
You better tell me
what I need to know.

11:47.010 --> 11:50.100
Hey, hey! Hey!
Whoa! What are you doing?

11:50.144 --> 11:51.754
He's the supervisor.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.582
He must know where
that shipment was headed.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.410
-Stop!

11:55.453 --> 11:58.761
Stop, he can't speak
through your fist.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.328
Well done. Now he's gonna
go call the cops.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.590
I don't care.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.374
You could've
broken his jaw.

12:03.418 --> 12:06.682
We don't hurt
innocent people.
What is wrong with you?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.554
Okay, look, sorry.
Sometimes I just
get a little...

12:10.817 --> 12:12.470
I had a rough
couple of months.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.951
Yeah, well, maybe you
should take a few more
and cool down.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.431
I said I was sorry.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.433
This was a mistake.

12:19.564 --> 12:20.609
What?

12:27.224 --> 12:29.749
I've gotta say I'm surprised
you haven't kicked me out yet.

12:30.619 --> 12:31.620
For what?

12:31.663 --> 12:33.796
Assuming the scientist
was a man.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.233
I was raised
better than that. Sorry.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.453
Apology accepted.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.107
Can you at least
tell me your name?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.023
Doctor...

12:43.850 --> 12:45.155
Kieran.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.636
Dr. Kieran.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.642
I'll bet your other lab rats
haven't offended you
this much, Dr. Kieran.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.426
I don't offend easily.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.211
And there are
no other subjects.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.299
What?

12:59.735 --> 13:00.997
I'm the only one?

13:01.041 --> 13:02.999
That's right.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.785
What, was I the only one
crazy enough to risk my life
for something unknown?

13:05.828 --> 13:09.266
Out of over 100 applicants,
all but 12 were acceptably
risk-tolerant.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.791
Okay. But why
did you pick me?

13:12.879 --> 13:14.315
I have my reasons.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.099
Oh, come on.

13:16.143 --> 13:19.233
Dr. K, I have never been
picked for anything.

13:19.276 --> 13:20.495
So you have to tell me.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.109
Nagel's spider in
the shower conundrum.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.502
The spider thing?

13:28.851 --> 13:30.984
That was a multiple
choice question.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.203
There's a spider in a shower,

13:33.247 --> 13:35.858
and it's been there
for days, trapped.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.555
And every time
you turn the water on,

13:37.599 --> 13:39.862
it tries to run
for its life to escape,

13:39.906 --> 13:43.126
but it can't get out.
So what do you do?

13:43.170 --> 13:45.650
Do you move it
to safety, do you kill it?

13:45.694 --> 13:47.696
Nothing. You don't know
what the spider wants.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.132
You leave it the hell alone.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.134
Yeah.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.006
Was I the only one
who picked C?

13:53.049 --> 13:54.355
Other than me.

13:56.357 --> 14:00.143
Okay. So you
picked me because

14:00.187 --> 14:03.581
I don't care
whether a spider
lives or dies.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.193
If this thing works,
the last thing I want
is a hero.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.195
Then you have
nothing to worry about.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.112
My brother,

14:12.939 --> 14:14.462
the one who passed,

14:14.897 --> 14:16.594
he was a hero.

14:16.638 --> 14:19.162
He was so perfect
it could be nauseating.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.427
Believe me,
I've never been a hero.

14:24.515 --> 14:25.908
Neither have I.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.736
You ever lost someone, Dr. K?

14:28.911 --> 14:30.304
Yeah.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.524
She was the only hero
I ever had.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.751
Oh!

14:46.407 --> 14:47.451
Hey.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.714
Oh, my.

14:49.758 --> 14:52.195
I don't think
you can cook a turkey
four different times.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.154
It's accumulating flavor.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.591
Yeah. Uh...

14:56.634 --> 14:58.941
Listen, Brainy called
on my way over here.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.944
He's still running tests
on the label that you brought
back from the shipyard.

15:01.988 --> 15:05.643
But they did find
the missing bodies
of the Children of Liberty.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.907
And there was no evidence
they were killed by aliens.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.300
-But,

15:10.344 --> 15:11.954
this was personal.

15:11.998 --> 15:15.784
Busted skulls, broke jaws,
in addition to gunshot wounds.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.612
Broken jaws.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.573
Do you think brass knuckles
could cause that much damage?

15:22.617 --> 15:25.272
If they're paired with
a strong enough arm, yeah.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.969
Huh.

15:29.667 --> 15:33.062
I, uh, thought you
might be re-heating,
so I brought wings.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.803
-Oh, come on.
-Thank God.

15:34.846 --> 15:35.935
Uh, no offense.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.893
-Offense taken.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.244
I, uh, saw Manchester
at the bar when I was
grabbing dinner.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.855
He wanted me to tell you
how sorry he was.

15:43.899 --> 15:47.598
J'onn, you told me
Manchester was on the path
of peace, like you.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.861
We share
a similar struggle, yeah.

15:49.905 --> 15:53.604
So I understand
how much he wants to feel
like he's doing something.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.867
And how hard it is
for him to resist his more

15:56.868 --> 15:58.783
violent urges.

15:58.827 --> 16:01.656
You don't think he's capable
of killing five Children
of Liberty, do you?

16:01.699 --> 16:03.745
He is angry.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.965
But under that anger
is just a lot of pain.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.531
Fiona's death just rocked him.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.751
Manchester has a good heart.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.406
I'm not ready to give up
on him just yet.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.538
I mean, he's been on my side
every step of the fight.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.193
He's resourceful and stubborn.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.804
And if he wants something
he'll go after it.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.023
He could be useful.

16:22.633 --> 16:23.852
Okay.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.337
Supergirl.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.993
I thought you wanted
nothing to do with me.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.995
Yeah.

16:36.038 --> 16:39.041
But I spoke to J'onn
and he said I should
give you another chance.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.828
It's a pot pie.
It comes in peace.

16:46.614 --> 16:47.615
Thank you.

16:54.230 --> 16:55.927
I never got the chance
to meet Fiona.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.844
But J'onn tells me
she was remarkable.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.064
She was.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.547
I know you want
justice for her.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.028
I wanna help you find that.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.379
Supergirl.
-Just a second.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.858
Brainy, what is it?

17:13.902 --> 17:15.730
Did we get a hit
on the contents
of the container?

17:15.773 --> 17:18.341
The label itself
was too destroyed
to interpret.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.257
But I found the residue
on it to be 80% glue

17:21.301 --> 17:23.259
and 9.73% ink.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.522
The rest was Nalcyite.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.263
What is that?
Is it dangerous?

17:27.307 --> 17:28.830
It's Nalcian table salt.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.441
However, on Earth,
it could be quite volatile.

17:31.485 --> 17:34.227
Under the right conditions,
it has an explosive factor

17:34.270 --> 17:37.404
of 8,000 joules per gram,

17:37.447 --> 17:40.972
or that of a tiny, precise
nuclear explosion.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.674
I should get back
to the DEO.

17:46.717 --> 17:49.938
No, wait. The DEO
is already on it
looking for that bomb.

17:49.981 --> 17:53.768
So maybe you and I
can crack something here.

17:53.811 --> 17:56.118
Your friend said he'll call
if he finds something, right?

17:57.293 --> 17:58.816
Right. Yeah.

18:01.819 --> 18:02.951
Here.

18:03.691 --> 18:04.866
Whoa.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.481
Want some?

18:15.181 --> 18:16.443
Thank you.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.926
So are you ever
actually gonna tell me
what it is we're doing here?

18:27.062 --> 18:30.631
In success,
which I'm counting on,
you'll need to know.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.244
We're attempting
to cure everything.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.681
Like cancer?

18:37.725 --> 18:39.553
Everything that
makes men weak.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.644
Are you telling me
if this had happened
a year ago,

18:43.687 --> 18:45.124
that my brother
might still be here?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.473
Not only that,

18:46.516 --> 18:48.127
but if this works,

18:48.170 --> 18:51.086
we'll cure not only
all human ailments,
but you'll get...

18:53.262 --> 18:54.350
Abilities.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.612
What, like superpowers?

18:55.656 --> 18:56.657
Something like that.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.788
But you didn't want a hero.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.095
I wanted someone responsible.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.837
Somebody who wouldn't think
that they knew what was best
just because they had powers.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.493
Whoa. Um...

19:08.973 --> 19:11.150
I don't think
this is a good idea.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.979
I'm not a good person.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.981
You know, I lied to you
about my scar?

19:17.025 --> 19:18.940
Yeah, it's not
from a hockey stick.

19:18.983 --> 19:22.204
Looks like a surgical
incision. Maybe from
a kidney transplant?

19:22.248 --> 19:25.860
That kidney is the reason
my perfect selfless
brother is dead.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.167
I needed a kidney
and he volunteered.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.081
And the whole thing
was supposed to be routine,

19:30.125 --> 19:32.606
but he died
on the operating table
to save me.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.265
You know what
the worst part is?

19:39.308 --> 19:40.570
If the roles
had been reversed,

19:40.614 --> 19:42.311
I wouldn't have given him
my freaking kidney!

19:42.355 --> 19:45.009
No way!
I was too selfish.

19:46.489 --> 19:50.232
I was the one dying,
I am the one who's
supposed to be dead!

19:51.277 --> 19:53.670
Is that why you signed up?

19:53.714 --> 19:55.629
Because you don't care
if you're gonna live or die?

19:56.151 --> 19:57.718
Um, look, Dr. K,

19:57.761 --> 20:00.329
you're obviously doing
something great here,

20:00.373 --> 20:01.939
and I don't wanna
mess this up for you.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.898
I mean, you said that
this could save,
what, millions?

20:03.941 --> 20:06.596
Hundreds.
Hundreds of millions.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.338
Yeah, well,
everything I touch is cursed.

20:09.382 --> 20:12.428
If you've had
a change of heart and you
wanna drop back, that's...

20:12.472 --> 20:14.169
-That's okay.
-That's not it at all.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.954
You deserve someone
way better than me
to help you achieve this.

20:16.998 --> 20:19.043
Out of 100 applicants,
I chose you.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.131
What if you chose wrong?

20:20.175 --> 20:21.872
Well, I'm a very smart woman.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.877
I stand by my choice.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.623
I was so wrong.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.843
I thought if I joined
the Children of Liberty

20:37.323 --> 20:38.976
-I wouldn't feel so...

20:39.020 --> 20:41.631
I guess this is what happens
when we let fear guide us.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.068
Yeah.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.812
We both made choices
that got us here, right?

20:48.856 --> 20:51.032
I mean,
I asked you for help.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.601
No. If you stay,

20:54.644 --> 20:57.865
if you blow up that monument
then everyone's gonna think
you're with them.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.823
That you're
a Child of Liberty.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.217
You're gonna give them
the face they've been
dying for, the legitimacy.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.871
So what?

21:03.914 --> 21:05.176
That's what happens
if I stay.

21:05.220 --> 21:08.136
But if I go
and I preserve my reputation,

21:08.179 --> 21:09.485
you die.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.139
And then what, Tom?
I'm lost.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.402
And you're dead.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.186
And then I am
no better than him.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.276
And I'm stronger than that.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.930
I have spent my entire life
building myself up into
the man that I am today

21:19.974 --> 21:23.586
and I have not given society
one reason to doubt me.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.809
But what is reputation?

21:28.852 --> 21:30.985
I mean, what is it?
It's nothing.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.293
It's not who you are.

21:34.336 --> 21:37.034
So if the latest fringe group
wants to tear
that monument down,

21:37.078 --> 21:39.254
we will build it
right back up.

21:42.126 --> 21:45.347
Agent Liberty can do
whatever he wants
with my reputation.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.089
I know who I am.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.093
I keep coming
across this problem.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.138
The container was empty
when we got to it,

21:54.182 --> 21:56.880
which means
they had to get rid
of the cargo somewhere.

21:56.924 --> 21:59.361
But the logs say
the shipment just arrived.

21:59.405 --> 22:02.756
They didn't have time
to unload there or to make
land at any other docks.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.542
At least not
on the mainland.

22:06.586 --> 22:10.241
They had to have
stopped at an island.
That's the only way.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.027
The missing alien
fission rods...

22:16.465 --> 22:17.771
They're on Shelley Island.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.121
That's where Fi came through.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.166
I thought it was defunct.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.604
It was, but it runs
on alien fission rods,

22:24.647 --> 22:25.866
just like the ones
that were stolen.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.346
They turned
the island back on.

22:27.955 --> 22:30.044
I have to alert the DEO.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.394
Wait. Hey, look,
if this is their home base,

22:32.438 --> 22:34.614
and they're
planning something,
Agent Liberty will be there.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.137
Exactly. That's why
we need backup.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.052
No, it's why
we need to be smart.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.359
A guy like that
can smell the DEO
a mile away.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.144
If we go in blazing,
he'll hit the trigger,
or worse.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.408
We need to
sneak in on the hush.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.367
No big guns.
You know,

22:49.150 --> 22:50.369
your way.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.809
Okay.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.985
But there are power-dampening
pylons on the island.

22:58.028 --> 23:00.291
We have to be careful.
But luckily,

23:00.335 --> 23:01.815
I always come prepared.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.643
It's a yellow sun grenade
to boost my powers.

23:03.686 --> 23:05.819
Think of it like
a Kryptonian multivitamin.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.864
Hmm. Can I see that?

23:08.691 --> 23:09.997
Yeah.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.784
Brilliant.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.134
-I knew I'd do right
teaming up with you.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.668
Wow. It's beautiful.

23:28.711 --> 23:32.715
Yeah. You should've
seen this place when
it was fully operational.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.761
There's the power dampeners.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.865
Stay where you are!

23:56.739 --> 23:59.699
Sorry, Supergirl.
I saw an opportunity.

23:59.742 --> 24:03.137
My new mates here
promised me an audience
with their king.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.444
So I delivered.

24:10.579 --> 24:11.754
You set me up?

24:11.798 --> 24:15.410
All this time,
you were playing me

24:15.454 --> 24:17.325
Pain is a great motivator.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.719
I told you I'd do anything.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.068
You must be Caldwell.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.244
Petrocelli said
I could trust you.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.072
You get us Supergirl

24:25.115 --> 24:26.856
and you get to meet the boss.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.424
All right, gentlemen,
you know the deal.
This has to look legit.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.296
And, you,
don't pull the trigger
until we're near her.

24:48.269 --> 24:51.490
All right then,
as the roaches say,

24:52.578 --> 24:54.057
"Take me to your leader."

24:54.101 --> 24:56.451
Have patience.
He'll be here soon.

25:01.064 --> 25:04.154
Alex. Alex,
can you hear me?

25:18.212 --> 25:20.257
Left arm.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.566
Back to treating me
like a number.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.829
I guess you've finally
seen the error of your ways.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.570
I don't deserve to be here.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.224
You're not a bad person, Adam.

25:33.183 --> 25:34.620
You called me "Adam."

25:34.663 --> 25:37.187
You're also not responsible
for your brother's death.

25:38.319 --> 25:39.755
There are hundreds of things
that could've caused

25:39.799 --> 25:41.365
what happened
on that operating table.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.629
We know one thing
that wasn't responsible,
and that's you.

25:43.672 --> 25:46.457
You didn't cause it,
you couldn't have stopped it.

25:46.501 --> 25:49.112
It was just bad luck.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.332
Bad luck doesn't
make you a bad person.

25:51.375 --> 25:52.942
Bad choices do.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.815
And I would know
because I'm a much
worse person than you.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.643
Is this about
the person you lost?

26:00.384 --> 26:01.603
Who was she?

26:09.437 --> 26:11.831
My mother.

26:11.874 --> 26:15.791
My real one,
not my adoptive, who is
very much alive and kicking.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.097
How old were you?

26:17.663 --> 26:19.403
Four.

26:19.447 --> 26:22.363
You don't have to
tell me what happened.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.583
No, I know. It's fine.
I want to.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.197
We were visiting family
she said.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.289
Somewhere by the water,
a lake I think.

26:36.856 --> 26:38.379
It was...

26:39.728 --> 26:42.078
It was so green.

26:42.122 --> 26:45.908
It wasn't a very bright day,
it was overcast,

26:45.952 --> 26:47.388
but my mom said
that's where the magic was.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.825
It was the rain
that made the green.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.566
So of course,
she went swimming.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.135
She didn't come back.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.659
-I'm sorry.
-No.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.184
See, I was there.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.752
I was with her
on the shore,

27:05.058 --> 27:06.450
when she went in,

27:06.494 --> 27:09.192
and when she went under
and I did nothing.

27:10.063 --> 27:13.153
I didn't run,
I didn't cry.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.721
I just stood there.

27:16.722 --> 27:17.984
You were four.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.942
What kind of child
doesn't run to their mother

27:19.986 --> 27:21.770
or doesn't scream for help?

27:22.771 --> 27:24.381
I knew.

27:24.425 --> 27:25.644
I knew something was wrong,

27:25.687 --> 27:29.604
but I did nothing.
I just watched her die.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.656
And afterward,
I was brought to this

27:38.657 --> 27:40.180
terrible family.

27:42.835 --> 27:44.663
And I have
spent my life

27:45.794 --> 27:47.230
fighting their legacy,

27:48.188 --> 27:50.799
and their crimes
and their evil deeds,

27:52.192 --> 27:54.107
but I've always know that...

27:57.023 --> 27:58.851
That deep down inside,

28:01.767 --> 28:03.551
that I belonged with them.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.645
Get some rest.

28:20.002 --> 28:24.528
Tonight, the human hero
Guardian pledged
his allegiance to humanity

28:24.572 --> 28:26.356
as he exterminated

28:26.400 --> 28:30.186
not only the symbol
of alien pride, but
the greatest adversary...

28:34.756 --> 28:36.715
"But the greatest threat

28:37.106 --> 28:38.891
to our survival,

28:40.762 --> 28:42.242
Supergirl."

28:44.679 --> 28:47.508
Remember, if you say
anything off-book,

28:47.551 --> 28:50.293
if you so much as
frown at the camera,

28:50.337 --> 28:52.252
-I will not hesitate--
-I know the rules.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.822
And you're sure that
there's no one
in that monument?

28:56.865 --> 28:58.301
Cross my heart.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.130
Now stand in front
of the detonator
and say "cheese."

29:48.699 --> 29:51.572
Tiny, precise
nuclear explosion.

29:57.621 --> 30:01.147
So, I've been thinking
about starting a chapter
across the pond.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.802
You know,
Children of Britain.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.456
Here we are.

30:09.720 --> 30:10.852
Come on in.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.724
Five minutes, Mr. Lockwood.

30:13.768 --> 30:14.856
You got it.

30:20.731 --> 30:21.776
Mr. Black.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.345
I've heard a lot about you.

30:26.912 --> 30:27.869
Please,

30:28.914 --> 30:29.871
let's talk.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.395
Yes, let's.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.985
My name is James Olsen.

30:59.074 --> 31:03.035
And I believe in
the Children of Liberty,
and everything they stand for.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.037
Only humans

31:06.255 --> 31:07.648
belong on Earth.

31:09.780 --> 31:10.912
James!

31:15.395 --> 31:16.875
Device online.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.617
James!

31:24.273 --> 31:25.884
Device activated.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.932
James!

31:37.460 --> 31:40.159
I hear you wanna discuss
the possibility of expanding

31:40.202 --> 31:41.943
the Children of Liberty
to Europe.

31:41.987 --> 31:44.946
But I thought you made plans
to live here with Fiona.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.864
Of course
you're not Agent Liberty.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.648
Because if you've
connected me to Fiona,

31:51.692 --> 31:54.216
you know
the only reason I'm here
is to avenge her.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.522
And he'd never risk that.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.448
I made a deal
with our dead friend
over there

32:08.491 --> 32:10.102
and he did not deliver.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.451
-Maybe you can.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.453
Who is Agent Liberty?

32:13.496 --> 32:15.934
If I tell you,
you'll let me live?

32:15.977 --> 32:18.719
I believe disloyalty
should be rewarded.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.899
James, come on, see me!

32:29.686 --> 32:31.819
I do this
in the name of humanity.

32:39.479 --> 32:40.828
James!

32:40.871 --> 32:41.872
Supergirl?

32:42.699 --> 32:43.787
James!

32:44.266 --> 32:45.485
Get him!

32:57.192 --> 32:58.628
Come on!

32:59.194 --> 33:00.413
Take him down!

33:13.034 --> 33:14.079
Don't move!

33:21.042 --> 33:23.044
Countdown initiated.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.307
Twenty, 19...

33:25.351 --> 33:27.005
I honored
my end of the deal.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.442
I delivered the goods.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.183
But I think now
I'm gonna take it back.

33:31.226 --> 33:32.880
Time to let
our caged bird free.

33:40.670 --> 33:45.893
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

33:46.894 --> 33:49.027
six, five...

34:17.751 --> 34:19.622
What

34:19.666 --> 34:22.103
It's your payment.
We're shutting down
the experiment.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.278
You're free to go.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.108
Wait, why?

34:27.152 --> 34:29.067
-No.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.592
No, we're just

34:32.635 --> 34:36.204
not moving forward, okay?
I've changed my mind.
It's not worth the risk.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.814
Of course there's risk.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.861
There's no progress
without risk.

34:40.904 --> 34:44.082
I just can't have another
death on my hands, okay?
It's not worth it.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.519
I've never done anything
meaningful in my life.

34:46.562 --> 34:49.826
And what you're doing here
is... Is miraculous.

34:49.870 --> 34:53.047
If I can be a part of this
my life will finally
make sense.

34:54.483 --> 34:57.095
Good people don't let
other people take
this kind of risk.

34:57.138 --> 35:00.141
I have a 15% chance
of my kidney transplant
not working.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.622
I live with risk every day.

35:02.665 --> 35:05.755
I mean, people risk
their lives for the things
they believe in all the time.

35:05.799 --> 35:08.149
They enlist and go to war
to protect their country.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.673
They become firefighters
to save other people.

35:10.717 --> 35:13.894
The risk I'd be taking
is worth it to me.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.158
And you are a good person.

35:17.202 --> 35:21.075
You said it yourself,
you could save hundreds
of millions of people.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.165
How many people
can say they have
the ability to do that?

35:24.209 --> 35:27.386
So you made one
very human mistake when
you were practically a baby.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.170
That was not your fault.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.520
And look at all the good
you're doing now.

35:31.564 --> 35:34.393
Please don't take
this gift away from me.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.221
Please let me do
something good.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.709
Subject 0331,

35:47.623 --> 35:49.103
trial one commencement.

35:57.938 --> 35:59.157
Thank you.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.071
You betrayed
Supergirl tonight.

36:44.114 --> 36:47.117
You betrayed me
and your promise to Fiona.

36:47.161 --> 36:48.771
No vengeance
is worth your soul.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.382
What soul, old man?

36:50.425 --> 36:53.123
I saw the love
you had for Fiona,
how you fought for her.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.951
I also know
what you're gonna do,

36:54.995 --> 36:56.910
and I can't let you
kill a man,

36:56.953 --> 36:58.694
even if that man
is Agent Liberty.

36:58.738 --> 37:01.131
Once you cross that line,
Manchester, there is
no going back.

37:01.175 --> 37:03.786
You have no idea what lines
I've already crossed.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.180
See that there?

37:06.224 --> 37:09.966
That's your heart beating.
Mine is dead.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.447
And every time
I close my eyes

37:12.491 --> 37:14.362
and wait to hear Fi's voice,

37:15.276 --> 37:17.887
there's nothing.
There's just silence.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.325
I'm empty, man.

37:20.368 --> 37:21.630
That is not true!

37:21.674 --> 37:23.153
You wanna know the truth?

37:24.590 --> 37:26.200
Look.

37:39.387 --> 37:40.910
Why won't it stop?

37:40.954 --> 37:43.043
It's an empathy amplifier.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.045
It was created
to use against empaths,

37:45.088 --> 37:48.178
double the hurt
and keep everything in.

37:48.222 --> 37:51.747
If I can't escape this pain,
neither can you.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.836
You shouldn't have
believed in me.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.842
We have concluded
our first human trial.

38:01.104 --> 38:04.064
Test subject 0331
exhibited what could
be considered

38:04.107 --> 38:07.589
extra-human powers
for precisely three minutes
and 14 seconds.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.028
Time of death, 4:03 a.m.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.206
Despite the expiration
of the subject,

38:16.250 --> 38:19.514
the trial reaped
new and critical information
on the human genome.

38:20.950 --> 38:24.911
Future trials run at
an 87% probability of success.

38:24.954 --> 38:27.043
Payment will be sent
to the subject's next of kin.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.091
I'm so sorry, Adam.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.138
I moved the spider.

38:39.534 --> 38:40.970
What you working on?

38:41.449 --> 38:42.885
Hey. Um...

38:45.323 --> 38:48.500
You know, they made me
say a lot of things
in that camera today.

38:50.284 --> 38:52.982
Horrible things
that I don't believe in.

38:53.026 --> 38:55.245
So I just wanna tell
my side of the story

38:55.289 --> 38:57.987
about my time with
the Children of Liberty.

38:58.031 --> 39:00.990
Yeah, I've been thinking
a lot about that, too.

39:02.514 --> 39:03.950
Duality.

39:04.907 --> 39:07.606
How people can surprise you.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.914
Manchester Black is...

39:12.828 --> 39:14.134
Is bad.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.876
He killed people,
he betrayed me, but...

39:18.007 --> 39:19.966
But then he turned around
to help me. I...

39:20.009 --> 39:21.271
Well, maybe he wasn't
trying to help you.

39:21.315 --> 39:22.969
Maybe that was
just a consequence.

39:23.012 --> 39:26.625
Yeah, I guess people
only show you what
they want you to see.

39:26.668 --> 39:28.278
And that's not always
who they are.

39:28.322 --> 39:31.281
Yeah. I mean,
look at me, I...

39:33.762 --> 39:35.503
I compromised myself today.

39:35.547 --> 39:36.852
You saved Tom's life.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.202
But I risked
everything I've worked for.

39:40.378 --> 39:44.120
Everything, my reputation,
my life.

39:46.645 --> 39:48.037
Your life.

39:52.912 --> 39:54.914
You know, though,

39:54.957 --> 39:57.438
I guess
I kind of understand

39:58.700 --> 40:02.138
a little better
why Lena lied to me
about the DA now.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.402
You should tell her that.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.457
Pasta is in.

40:21.767 --> 40:25.118
Look, I know we didn't
leave things off
on the best note,

40:26.902 --> 40:28.426
and I was just...

40:30.515 --> 40:32.691
I was thinking
we could try again.

40:35.607 --> 40:36.738
How was your day?

40:36.782 --> 40:38.740
You know what,
I'm pretty tired.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.135
Got a lot of work to do.

40:44.050 --> 40:45.530
See you tomorrow?

40:47.923 --> 40:49.447
Tomorrow it is.

40:58.934 --> 41:01.633
What do we got, a couple
of wise guys over here?

41:06.507 --> 41:07.508
Hey.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.555
What's wrong?

41:13.993 --> 41:15.385
I failed.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.260
I was wrong.
I was wrong.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.482
Manchester, uh...

41:25.787 --> 41:27.223
He killed all of them.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.400
I'm so sorry.

41:31.053 --> 41:32.707
I'm so sorry.
