01:03.240 --> 01:05.919
- Dear Whit.

01:05.920 --> 01:10.050
I regret to inform you that
Holden Caulfield is dead.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.009
I know you thought he could protect me.

01:17.960 --> 01:22.045
Or at the very least give
me refuge from my sarcasm.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.321
But Holden is gone forever.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.488
And I don't know if
anything can save me now.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.479
- Oh, where's your girl, Jerry?

02:01.480 --> 02:02.286
Where'd she go?

02:02.287 --> 02:03.281
- Ah, she wanted to
dance with her brother.

02:03.282 --> 02:04.719
- That's a tight family.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.279
- You know, the Lusitania
making it to England

02:06.280 --> 02:08.121
is more hopeful than getting
laid at this rat trap.

02:08.122 --> 02:08.961
- Oh, I don't know.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.038
Spoiled rich girls love college dropouts.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.166
They're all dying to tell their fathers,

02:12.167 --> 02:14.401
"He's not only broke,
Daddy, he's also a Jew."

02:14.402 --> 02:15.686
- Hey, half Jew.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.202
Why do we keep coming here?

02:22.203 --> 02:24.521
I can't stand all these flits and phonies.

02:24.522 --> 02:27.410
- To give girls like that the time.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.239
- Who is that?

02:31.240 --> 02:32.719
- Oona O'Neill.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.006
- What, as in Eugene O'Neill?

02:34.007 --> 02:35.399
- That's her dad.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.679
Rumor is she's got a thing for writers.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.045
- Maybe I can get her drunk
and read her one of my stories.

02:40.046 --> 02:41.005
- The drunk part, yes.

02:41.006 --> 02:42.126
Not so sure about the second.

02:42.127 --> 02:43.519
I've read your work.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.362
- You're a real prince of a guy.

02:44.363 --> 02:45.486
Who are the bodyguards?

02:45.487 --> 02:48.479
- Blythe Chaucer and Carol Flourentine.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.719
Her protectors from morphine addicts

02:49.720 --> 02:52.519
and boys without trust funds.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.850
You even try to give Oona the time,

02:56.851 --> 02:59.799
they'll take your watch away.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.800
- Okay.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.367
I'm going in.

03:07.920 --> 03:08.967
Ladies, Oona.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.320
- Hello.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.128
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

03:12.129 --> 03:14.399
I'm Jerome David Salinger.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.039
My friends call me Jerry.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.959
- It's a pleasure to meet
you, Jerome David Salinger.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.359
- I'm a huge admirer of your father.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.361
I'm a writer myself, and his plays

03:22.362 --> 03:24.931
have been a great source
of inspiration to me.

03:24.932 --> 03:26.570
- What do you write?

03:28.040 --> 03:30.008
- I write short stories.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.128
- Really?

03:32.129 --> 03:34.282
- Have you been published?

03:37.840 --> 03:38.682
Come on, Oona.

03:38.683 --> 03:40.364
I want to introduce you to Billy Chandler.

03:40.365 --> 03:41.399
- He's here?

03:41.400 --> 03:42.206
- He is.

03:42.207 --> 03:43.040
- Oh, right now?

03:43.041 --> 03:43.848
Oh.
- Great.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.079
- Let's go.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.128
- Until me meet again,
Jerome David Salinger.

03:47.129 --> 03:49.399
- Come on, Oona doll.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
Billy.

03:52.920 --> 03:57.319
- Excuse me, sir, do you
happen to know the time?

03:57.320 --> 03:58.526
That went well.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.482
- Through the course

04:30.483 --> 04:33.802
of my fascinatingly dull life
I've always found fiction

04:33.803 --> 04:36.690
so much more truthful than reality.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.526
And yes, I'm aware of the irony.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.001
He had neither the looks,
personality, or good clothes

05:11.002 --> 05:13.039
to gain Shirley's interest.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.879
He didn't have a chance.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.564
And as I said before,
to write a really good

05:16.565 --> 05:18.919
boy meets girl story it's wise

05:18.920 --> 05:21.366
to have the boy meet the girl.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.082
- I can't concentrate with
you staring at me like that.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.439
- Well do you like it?

05:33.440 --> 05:34.360
- It's really good.

05:34.361 --> 05:35.166
- You can tell me the truth.

05:35.167 --> 05:36.002
- I am.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.126
It's terrific.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.809
Tie your shoes, sonny.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.839
- So what do you think, Mom?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.599
- I love the kids, I
love the way they talk.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.728
- Yeah, 'cause in the slicks
the teens always sound phony

05:48.729 --> 05:50.639
because they're written
by 50 year old drunks.

05:51.483 --> 05:52.641
You know, it just kills me.

05:52.642 --> 05:55.211
- Well, you're really talented.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.807
- I think I want to try to publish.

06:02.808 --> 06:06.079
- How would you do that?

06:06.080 --> 06:10.210
- I want to go back to school,
study creative writing.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.124
- You what?

06:16.200 --> 06:17.759
You get kicked out of
every school I send you to

06:17.760 --> 06:19.444
because of that smart alec mouth of yours.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.359
How do you possibly believe

06:21.360 --> 06:24.250
you could be a professional writer?

06:25.240 --> 06:26.879
- I don't know.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.279
I just like doing it.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.439
- He's very talented, Sol.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.851
- Even if he is,
it's impossible to make

06:31.852 --> 06:34.081
a living at it even for
the best of students.

06:34.082 --> 06:36.479
You're not even a good student.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.479
- I can't do anything right.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.801
- Sonny, sonny, come here, sit down.

06:40.802 --> 06:42.689
It's all right, please.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.407
I, I just don't want
you to be disappointed

06:49.408 --> 06:51.482
when it doesn't work out.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.439
And it won't.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.566
It never does.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.919
Listen to me.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.159
Meat and cheese distribution

07:00.160 --> 07:02.559
has been very good to this family.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.370
Six years ago Buddy Richmond
was practically broke.

07:05.371 --> 07:09.490
He buys a slaughterhouse and
now he's king of the bacon.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.045
That could be you, sonny boy.

07:16.046 --> 07:17.724
- Jerry is not going to sell cheese,

07:17.725 --> 07:20.359
or pigs, or cows, or milk.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.601
He is not going to be
the king of the bacon.

07:22.602 --> 07:25.199
He is going to go to Columbia.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.122
He is going to study writing.

07:27.123 --> 07:29.122
That's what Jerry is going to do,

07:29.123 --> 07:31.771
and you are going to pay for it.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.684
- I bet if I never walked

07:41.685 --> 07:43.409
into your class that day
then Holden Caulfield

07:43.410 --> 07:45.767
probably wouldn't even exist.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.131
So in a way this whole mess

07:49.132 --> 07:52.090
is as much your fault as it is mine.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.322
- There is nothing more sacred than story.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.683
The Bible, the Quran, the Torah,

08:01.684 --> 08:05.844
the stories contained in
these books are so powerful

08:07.680 --> 08:11.002
that people actually believe
they were written by a God.

08:11.003 --> 08:14.288
That is the power that a story can hold.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.970
And in the course of this semester

08:16.971 --> 08:20.319
you will be given the
tools and the techniques

08:20.320 --> 08:23.369
to be able to create your own stories

08:24.800 --> 08:28.359
so that you can enrapture people, move...

08:28.360 --> 08:30.362
- I was always a lousy student,

08:30.363 --> 08:33.318
even when I wanted to be there.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.846
It was pretty embarrassing,
if you want to know the truth.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.809
- How does that sound, Mr. Salinger?

08:40.840 --> 08:43.047
- I'm so sorry, you lost me at Bible.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.165
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Salinger.

08:46.166 --> 08:49.999
Did you think that this
course was a study in atheism?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.639
- No, no, I didn't.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.279
But I'm hoping there really is a god

08:53.280 --> 08:55.123
that'll give you something
interesting to say.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.645
- Funny, I had the same thought

08:59.646 --> 09:01.529
when I read your admissions essay.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.724
Although they still let you in.

09:04.725 --> 09:06.719
It must be a very lean year for Columbia.

09:07.563 --> 09:10.848
Mr. Salinger wrote an essay, very funny,

09:12.280 --> 09:15.559
brimming with exactly the sort of sarcasm

09:15.560 --> 09:18.239
that he so beautifully displayed here

09:18.240 --> 09:20.999
in the first five minutes of the course.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.129
And yet after that Mr. Salinger failed

09:25.280 --> 09:29.365
to turn that clever voice of
his into an actual narrative.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.322
Which is a shame, because
there is some potential there.

09:34.323 --> 09:39.159
But this is the work we will
all be striving to achieve.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.082
And by the end of this
semester, God willing,

09:42.083 --> 09:43.889
or in Mr. Salinger's case, unwilling,

09:45.920 --> 09:48.048
you will all understand the difference

09:48.049 --> 09:52.204
between wanting to be a
writer and actually being one.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.526
- My countrymen and my friends.

09:59.527 --> 10:02.046
I had hoped against hope that some miracle

10:02.047 --> 10:05.119
would prevent a devastating war in Europe

10:05.120 --> 10:09.205
and bring to an end the
invasion of Poland by Germany.

10:10.240 --> 10:14.325
I have said many times that I
have seen war and I hate war.

10:15.920 --> 10:20.079
I hope the United States
will keep out of this war.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.969
I believe that it will.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.919
- Oh Mr. Salinger.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.599
Come in, have a seat.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.719
Would you like a drink?

10:30.720 --> 10:33.371
- Coffee, please.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.847
So, how did you find me here?

10:38.840 --> 10:40.126
- Oh, I used to go to NYU and I always

10:40.127 --> 10:42.919
saw you grading papers in the window.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.159
Hey, why do you come all
the way down to the Village?

10:45.160 --> 10:46.491
- I couldn't think of a
better place to read the work

10:46.492 --> 10:48.125
of the next Fitzgerald or Hemingway

10:48.126 --> 10:50.282
than right here in Greenwich Village.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.559
- Sir.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.559
- Thank you.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.561
- What about you?

10:53.562 --> 10:54.843
What happened at NYU?

10:54.844 --> 10:57.443
They kick you out for that mouth of yours?

10:57.444 --> 10:59.564
- No, it was a mutual understanding.

10:59.565 --> 11:01.847
They wanted me gone
and I wanted them dead.

11:01.848 --> 11:05.239
- Well you're not the first

11:05.240 --> 11:07.919
wise ass I've taught, you know?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.522
You act out at authority figures like me

11:09.523 --> 11:11.439
because you're emotionally
repressed at home.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.519
You also think you're the cleverest boy

11:12.520 --> 11:13.407
that ever walked the planet

11:13.408 --> 11:15.528
and no one recognizes
what a genius you are.

11:15.529 --> 11:20.279
It's pretty typical stuff, if
you want to know the truth.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.645
But enough of my dime store Freud.

11:21.646 --> 11:24.610
What can I do for you, Mr. Salinger?

11:27.400 --> 11:28.639
- Well, I wanted to ask about

11:28.640 --> 11:31.079
what you talked about in class.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.763
You know, my voice overwhelming the story.

11:33.764 --> 11:36.491
I always thought my voice is
what defines me as a writer.

11:36.492 --> 11:38.159
- Absolutely.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.721
Your voice is what
makes your story unique.

11:43.360 --> 11:47.399
But when that voice overwhelms the story,

11:47.400 --> 11:49.129
as it did in your admissions essay,

11:49.130 --> 11:52.439
then it becomes an
expression more of your ego

11:52.440 --> 11:56.331
than of the emotional
experience of the reader.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.959
Does that make sense?

11:59.960 --> 12:00.960
- Kind of.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.091
- Kind of.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.720
- No.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.641
- I'd apologize for being late.

12:09.642 --> 12:10.879
But since I'm going to be late

12:10.880 --> 12:12.365
for every single class this semester

12:12.366 --> 12:14.727
I'm going to instead save my strength

12:14.728 --> 12:18.999
for the reading of your
pages and heavy drinking.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.211
Now today I want to focus
on the writer's voice.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.851
And to illustrate this I'm going to

12:26.852 --> 12:30.399
read a passage to you
from William Faulkner.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.890
All right now I want
you to listen carefully.

12:31.891 --> 12:33.928
In fact, close your eyes.

12:35.640 --> 12:39.361
The jailer cut her down
and then revived her.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.805
Then he beat her and whipped her.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.764
She had hung herself with her dress.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.727
All right, so, what happened?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.528
- A woman in jail tried to commit suicide.

12:56.529 --> 12:59.559
And after the jailer
saved her, he beat her.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.402
- Exactly.

13:00.403 --> 13:03.046
This is why I let women audit my classes.

13:03.047 --> 13:05.925
Hopefully the rest of the
university will soon follow suit.

13:05.926 --> 13:07.682
All right now, I read this passage

13:07.683 --> 13:10.365
in as dull a voice as I
could possibly muster,

13:10.366 --> 13:13.999
and yet you were still all
engaged by the passage.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.842
Why?

13:14.843 --> 13:17.443
Because the events of the
story were compelling,

13:17.444 --> 13:19.441
thematically layered, and dramatic.

13:19.442 --> 13:22.171
Now of course Faulkner
is famous for his voice

13:22.172 --> 13:24.319
with its unique regional style.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.045
And so therefore even the non-writer

13:26.046 --> 13:27.485
thinks that they love Faulkner.

13:27.486 --> 13:30.399
But in fact it is the events of the story,

13:30.400 --> 13:33.609
the attempted suicide, the
beating that draws us in.

13:33.610 --> 13:36.251
And then Faulkner uses his voice

13:37.720 --> 13:40.564
to make the story uniquely his own.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.049
Does that make sense?

13:46.640 --> 13:47.971
For our next class I want you all

13:47.972 --> 13:50.167
to write a five page story.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.570
Ask yourselves, if I were
to read this in a monotone

13:56.440 --> 13:59.728
would I still keep the class' attention?

14:02.840 --> 14:04.126
Okay, well I'm really not going to do

14:04.127 --> 14:06.599
any better than that today, so that's it.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.839
You can use the rest of the time

14:07.840 --> 14:11.159
to write your story or masturbate.

14:12.003 --> 14:14.606
Just try not to confuse
the former with the latter.

14:14.607 --> 14:16.759
God knows there's many an author

14:16.760 --> 14:19.159
who has failed at that very task.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.000
Have a good weekend.

14:20.001 --> 14:21.001
See you later, children.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.886
- The one good
thing about being stuck

14:26.887 --> 14:28.530
in a nuthouse is everyone here

14:28.531 --> 14:31.364
is in the same lousy shape as I am.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.246
Truth be told, I never really fitted

14:36.247 --> 14:38.759
anywhere in the whole goddam world.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.399
Uptown I was a Jew,
downtown I was a square.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.162
But on occasion I could fool the girls

14:44.163 --> 14:46.686
into thinking I was Clark Gable's cousin.

14:46.687 --> 14:48.639
- Bravo, bravo.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.639
- Keep giving 'em hell, Ernie.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.480
- You know what?

14:52.481 --> 14:54.005
I actually think I keep on
getting kicked out of school

14:54.006 --> 14:56.199
'cause I love how much
it pisses my father off.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.120
- That's hilarious.

14:57.121 --> 14:58.007
You need to go with that.

14:58.008 --> 15:00.799
You should write your story about that.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.800
- Nah.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.483
- You got your watch on?

15:05.484 --> 15:06.606
- Yes, why?

15:06.607 --> 15:10.286
- 'Cause you need to
give that girl the time.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.520
- Yes I do.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.240
Hi.
- Hi.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.599
- So you like jazz?

15:19.600 --> 15:21.250
- What do you think?

15:24.560 --> 15:27.839
- So um, what do you do most
of the time on weekends?

15:27.840 --> 15:28.682
- I don't know.

15:28.683 --> 15:31.524
What do you do most of
the time on weekends?

15:31.525 --> 15:33.399
- This and that.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.159
- This and that?

15:35.160 --> 15:38.239
I know that's code for
sowing your wild oats.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.159
- Sow your wild oats?

15:46.160 --> 15:48.439
Sorry, I don't follow.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.879
- Oh please.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.008
Chase around, Joe College.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.002
- "Sow the wild oats?

16:02.003 --> 16:03.923
"I don't think I get your drift."

16:03.924 --> 16:07.239
"You know, chase around, Joe College."

16:07.240 --> 16:08.765
Suddenly from the other side of the room

16:08.766 --> 16:11.399
a small blonde shrieked with laughter.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.359
- Yes, it was very good.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.202
Your voice was present and entertaining.

16:15.203 --> 16:17.771
But it helped tell the
story, it didn't become it.

16:17.772 --> 16:18.879
- I felt it.

16:18.880 --> 16:19.688
You know, I could tell when something

16:19.689 --> 16:20.839
I wrote was too clever.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.646
- Was it true?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.480
- Some of it.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.367
Some I made up.

16:23.368 --> 16:24.771
- Well you know what we call that?

16:24.772 --> 16:25.799
- What?

16:25.800 --> 16:26.959
- Writing.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.959
- So how do I get it published?

16:28.960 --> 16:29.802
- Well that's a bit ambitious

16:29.803 --> 16:31.919
for your first outing, don't you think?

16:31.920 --> 16:33.079
- A real writer publishes, right?

16:33.080 --> 16:34.682
That's the only way to
make a living at it.

16:34.683 --> 16:36.601
- Oh wait, let me guess,
your father told you that.

16:36.602 --> 16:37.726
- Well why don't you try the New Yorker?

16:37.727 --> 16:39.245
I'm sure that would impress him.

16:39.246 --> 16:42.679
- I was actually thinking Story Magazine.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.279
I love their pieces.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.199
- Do you know who the editor of Story is?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.200
- Yeah, you.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.364
- And on behalf of Story

16:49.365 --> 16:51.484
I would like to thank
you for your submission.

16:51.485 --> 16:54.131
Unfortunately we're going
to decline at this time.

16:54.132 --> 16:58.159
But we do look forward to
reading your future submissions.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.639
Mr. Salinger, you're about to learn

16:59.640 --> 17:00.879
the second most important lesson

17:00.880 --> 17:02.848
in having a career as a writer.

17:02.849 --> 17:05.445
Learning to deal with rejection.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.719
- Well I'm going straight
to the New Yorker,

17:08.720 --> 17:09.480
and they're going to publish it,

17:09.481 --> 17:10.606
and you're going to be sorry.

17:10.607 --> 17:11.886
- I already am.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.118
- Hi, I'm here to submit...

17:22.119 --> 17:23.201
- Submit a short story?

17:23.202 --> 17:24.719
Fill this out.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.561
Leave your story.

17:25.563 --> 17:29.087
We'll get back to you
in four to six weeks.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.402
- It's the first story
I've ever submitted.

17:33.403 --> 17:36.688
- Well that's a historic day for us all.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.719
What's the J.D. stand for?

17:43.720 --> 17:45.961
- It's juvenile delinquent.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.405
- Don't write that.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.643
- And I want those
rewrites before next week.

17:52.644 --> 17:54.083
And do not get used to the idea

17:54.084 --> 17:55.605
of me staying for each class.

17:55.606 --> 17:57.648
My dinner plans canceled.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.599
Oh, it's your first rejection letter.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.039
You have to get that framed.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.119
- So what do I do now?

18:05.120 --> 18:05.960
- You're a writer.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.119
What do you think you do now?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.281
- Write another story?

18:08.282 --> 18:10.521
- Yes, and then write
another one after that.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.404
And then another one after that.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.202
- Okay.

18:20.203 --> 18:23.010
- And then another one after that!

18:26.240 --> 18:28.083
- Perhaps my
dreams of literary triumph

18:28.084 --> 18:30.599
were the delusions of an egotistical

18:30.600 --> 18:33.001
and overly ambitious boy
who should have listened

18:33.002 --> 18:37.130
when he was offered the chance
to be the king of the bacon.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.651
I could have been a king, Whit.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.039
- I don't know
if I'm cut out for this.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.088
- Yeah, maybe you're not.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.839
- You don't think I am?

18:53.840 --> 18:57.399
- Well, let me ask you a question.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.599
Why do you want to do this?

18:59.600 --> 19:00.600
- Publish?

19:01.760 --> 19:02.760
- No.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.079
Be a writer.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.128
Why do you want to write?

19:10.200 --> 19:14.639
- Because I, I get angry
about a lot of things.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.961
And when I'm writing I feel
like I'm doing something

19:16.962 --> 19:19.519
about it, like I'm finally
getting to speak my mind.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.567
- You see, Jerry, this is what you need

19:20.568 --> 19:22.919
to be doing in your writing.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.446
Explore what it is that makes you angry

19:25.447 --> 19:27.839
and then put that into a story.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.571
No, no, no, but here's the catch.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.999
You still may never publish.

19:34.000 --> 19:34.842
- Never?

19:34.843 --> 19:36.039
- Nope.

19:36.040 --> 19:40.799
You may spend the rest of
your life being rejected.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.359
And now you have to ask
yourself a question.

19:44.360 --> 19:48.490
Are you willing to devote
your life to telling stories

19:50.600 --> 19:54.161
knowing that you may
get nothing in return?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.648
And if the answer to that question is no,

19:59.649 --> 20:01.999
well then you should go out there

20:02.000 --> 20:05.083
and find yourself something
else to do with your life

20:05.084 --> 20:07.890
because you are not a true writer.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.126
Good day, thank you very much.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.086
No, no, no, no, take
your rejections with you.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.601
- Would you look at this place?

20:49.602 --> 20:50.806
It's beautiful.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.799
You'll find something else
you like to do, sonny.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.767
You'll see.

20:55.768 --> 20:58.039
And it'll be something you
can actually make a buck at.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.849
- Try not to worry about
anything this week, dear.

20:59.850 --> 21:02.889
It's a vacation and you should relax.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.402
- She had immense
eyes that always seemed

21:56.403 --> 21:59.879
in danger of capsizing
in their own innocence.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.959
She was with a small boy,
unmistakeably her brother.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.564
And it was only when
his sister spoke to him

22:04.565 --> 22:05.925
that he came around and applied

22:05.926 --> 22:08.279
the small of his back to his chair.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.736
Now there are two kinds of femme fatale.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.205
The noise of young people she'd invited.

22:11.206 --> 22:12.685
Sewing, mastering crossword puzzles.

22:12.686 --> 22:14.086
Her father's scotch was inadequate.

22:14.087 --> 22:15.605
Inside somebody up turned up...

22:20.120 --> 22:22.282
- Jerry, your sister didn't
drive all the way up here

22:22.283 --> 22:25.559
to watch you write in
a lobby for five days.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.722
Now, put that away and
come with us for a stroll.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.085
- I will in one hour.

22:30.086 --> 22:31.639
I'm almost done, okay?

22:31.640 --> 22:35.804
- What makes you think you
have anything to say to people?

22:41.960 --> 22:42.960
- Grow up.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.561
- Oh Jerry, would you
hang back for a minute.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.399
Now that you have made a true
commitment to your craft,

23:12.400 --> 23:14.559
I think it's time.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.528
- Time for what?

23:19.360 --> 23:21.488
- For you to be published.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
- In?

23:34.480 --> 23:36.162
This is the first damn story I gave you.

23:36.163 --> 23:37.639
- Oh, I loved it right away.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.926
I just had to be sure
you were a real writer

23:38.927 --> 23:40.729
before I published it.

23:42.760 --> 23:46.560
So, this is your first
check as a real writer.

23:55.880 --> 23:56.880
- Thank you.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.679
Thank you so much.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.602
- You're welcome.

24:00.603 --> 24:01.839
Now go write another story.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.639
- To publishing.
- To publishing.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.359
So, your old man finally impressed?

24:10.360 --> 24:11.200
- No.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.087
When I showed him the check he told me

24:12.088 --> 24:14.081
I could finally afford a
suit to get a real job.

24:14.082 --> 24:15.241
- To hell with him.

24:15.242 --> 24:17.481
He's just jealous because
you're a paid writer.

24:17.482 --> 24:20.519
He's nothing but a lousy Jew pig seller.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.360
- Do you know he hides the fact

24:21.361 --> 24:22.646
that he's Jewish from our neighbors?

24:22.647 --> 24:23.759
Always has.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.890
The first phony I ever met
was on the clay I was born.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.159
What the hell are they doing?

24:33.160 --> 24:34.161
- The Stork Club advertises

24:34.162 --> 24:36.364
that Oona comes here 'cause of her dad.

24:36.365 --> 24:39.091
But they only photograph her drinking milk

24:39.092 --> 24:41.159
because she's underage.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.481
- That could be the most
pathetic thing I've ever seen.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.319
All right, that's my cue.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.924
I'm going in.
- Ooh.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.120
- Oona.

24:55.121 --> 24:55.960
- Mm.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.562
- It's so lovely to see
you again, Carol, Blythe.

24:57.563 --> 24:58.400
- I'm Blythe.

24:58.401 --> 24:59.206
- Great.

24:59.207 --> 25:00.439
If you don't mind I'm going to give

25:00.440 --> 25:02.919
the most beautiful girl
in the world a twirl.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.402
- Oh, all right.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.079
I read your piece in Story.

25:16.080 --> 25:16.888
- You read Story?

25:16.889 --> 25:19.239
- I read everything.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.969
- What did you think?

25:23.080 --> 25:25.159
- I thought it was marvelous.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.447
No, it was simply marvelous.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.039
- Thank you.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.566
You're without a doubt the most
special girl I've ever seen.

25:32.567 --> 25:36.690
- And you're very
handsome, Jerome David Salinger.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.959
What do you think?

25:51.960 --> 25:52.880
- I love it.

25:52.881 --> 25:53.720
- Yeah?

25:53.721 --> 25:54.605
- Yeah, how long have you lived here?

25:54.606 --> 25:55.440
- Just a few months.

25:55.441 --> 25:56.911
But I don't think I'll
be here much longer.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.079
- Why, where are you going to go?

25:58.080 --> 25:59.080
- Hollywood.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.242
If I want to get into pictures

26:01.243 --> 26:03.759
that's the place to be, right?

26:03.760 --> 26:06.759
- Well, I used to want to be an actor.

26:06.760 --> 26:07.566
- Really?

26:07.567 --> 26:08.402
- But I hate Hollywood.

26:08.403 --> 26:10.359
It's a bunch of driving jerks

26:10.360 --> 26:12.120
making crap for knuckleheads
that can't read.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.680
- You're funny.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.049
And you're so talented.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.481
I love talent.

26:24.680 --> 26:25.520
- Don't go to California.

26:25.521 --> 26:26.519
- Why?

26:26.520 --> 26:27.965
- I think it's better if you stay here,

26:27.966 --> 26:30.008
stay here and do theater.

26:31.880 --> 26:35.639
Have you asked your dad to
put you in any of his plays?

26:35.640 --> 26:36.919
- Mm-mm.

26:36.920 --> 26:37.920
- Why?

26:39.680 --> 26:43.439
- I guess, we don't speak very often.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.679
- Um, I'm sorry I didn't.

26:45.680 --> 26:46.919
- It's all right.

26:46.920 --> 26:47.762
You know, I haven't seen him

26:47.763 --> 26:51.079
since I was a little girl actually.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.880
You know, I don't know
why he doesn't love me.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.807
I never did anything wrong.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.206
- My dad doesn't love me either.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.039
I should, I should, I should probably go.

27:14.040 --> 27:14.882
- Jerry.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.079
- No, it's...

27:16.080 --> 27:16.888
- Jerry, you don't have to.

27:16.889 --> 27:18.166
- If I get back to my writing

27:18.167 --> 27:20.279
I could get a lot done tonight.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.086
- Okay.

27:21.087 --> 27:22.087
- Um,

27:23.400 --> 27:24.240
do you want to go dancing Friday?

27:24.241 --> 27:25.080
- Yes.

27:25.081 --> 27:25.922
- Yes?

27:25.923 --> 27:27.319
- Yes, I'd love to.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.559
- All right, me too.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.560
- Okay.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.326
- Good.
- Okay.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.490
- That's the thing about girls.

27:43.491 --> 27:44.925
Every time they do something pretty

27:44.926 --> 27:47.571
you fall half in love with them.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.759
And then you never know
where the hell you are.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.879
- Jerry, Jerry, Jerry,
hang in there, my love.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.083
I know it can be a slog

27:59.084 --> 28:01.885
but you've got to stick
out these dry spells.

28:01.886 --> 28:03.562
Everyone loves the writing.

28:03.563 --> 28:06.159
I get terrific feedback
every time I submit you.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.002
- Well that's terrific, but I haven't

28:07.003 --> 28:09.039
had a story published in eight months.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.121
- Well, have you thought
about writing something

28:10.122 --> 28:12.839
with a little more pop to it,
most Post than New Yorker.

28:12.840 --> 28:13.646
- No, I hate the Post.

28:13.647 --> 28:14.924
It's a bunch of sentimental crap.

28:14.925 --> 28:15.805
- I know.

28:15.806 --> 28:16.847
- I want to be a New Yorker writer.

28:16.848 --> 28:19.566
- And you will be, but
it's never easy, my love.

28:19.567 --> 28:22.639
There's no harm in dumbing
it down once in a while.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.051
We've just got to get you published again.

28:24.052 --> 28:26.439
Publishing is everything.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.206
- I don't even know what
I should write about.

28:31.400 --> 28:32.400
- Oh Jerry.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.399
First of all, you need to relax.

28:37.400 --> 28:41.279
You're not going to do better
work being so stressed.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.090
Take that pretty girlfriend
of yours on a date.

28:44.091 --> 28:45.206
Have some fun.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.199
How's it going with her?

28:52.160 --> 28:53.679
- Hey, Pearl.

28:53.680 --> 28:57.239
- I'm sorry, Jerry, but Oona isn't here.

28:57.240 --> 29:00.239
She left for the Hamptons this morning.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.879
- She did what?

29:01.880 --> 29:03.199
We had a date.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.531
- You know Oona.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.244
- Yeah, okay, thanks.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.199
- Maybe I'm just not capable

29:27.200 --> 29:29.164
of experiencing happiness like the fellow

29:29.165 --> 29:30.525
that works at a lousy job

29:30.526 --> 29:34.570
and has a pretty wife and
a bunch of stupid kids.

29:35.560 --> 29:38.450
Maybe I didn't lose my mind at all.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.928
Maybe I never had it in the first place.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.639
- You should get out of here, kid.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.526
- He made his
way into the men's room

30:13.527 --> 30:15.841
and filled both washbowls with cold water.

30:15.842 --> 30:18.207
"You want a towel, fella?"
asked the piano player.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.559
"Not me," said Holden.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.402
"Why don't you go home, kid?"

30:22.403 --> 30:24.162
Holden Caulfield went on drinking.

30:24.163 --> 30:25.603
- Hello, it's me, Jerry Salinger.

30:25.604 --> 30:26.999
I just want to speak to Oona.

30:27.000 --> 30:27.887
- She's asleep.

30:27.888 --> 30:29.525
Why are you calling so late?

30:29.526 --> 30:31.884
- "This is me, Holden Caulfield.

30:31.885 --> 30:33.159
"Can I speak to Sally, please?"

30:33.160 --> 30:34.045
- I just want us to be together.

30:34.046 --> 30:35.199
It doesn't have to be anything serious.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.040
- It doesn't have to be anything serious?

30:36.041 --> 30:36.880
- I don't want anything serious, no.

30:36.881 --> 30:37.765
- Jerry, you just said otherwise.

30:37.766 --> 30:38.600
- I, don't twist my words.

30:38.601 --> 30:39.440
- You are just, you know what you are?

30:39.441 --> 30:40.280
You're just such a phony.

30:40.281 --> 30:41.086
- No, I'm not a phony.
- You are.

30:41.087 --> 30:42.167
You're just...
- Go to hell.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.600
Oona.

30:48.601 --> 30:49.442
- What?

30:49.443 --> 30:52.091
- Oona, can I call you tomorrow?

30:58.280 --> 31:00.202
- His teeth
chattering violently,

31:00.203 --> 31:01.884
Holden Caulfield stood on the corner

31:01.885 --> 31:05.009
and waited for the Madison Avenue bus.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.129
- It was a long wait.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.399
No, we didn't order champagne.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.400
- I did.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.527
I asked you here so we could celebrate.

31:30.528 --> 31:32.639
- Ah, celebrate what?

31:32.640 --> 31:34.961
- I have some exciting news.

31:36.560 --> 31:40.239
The New Yorker read Slight
Rebellion Off Madison,

31:40.240 --> 31:42.527
and they want to publish it.

31:43.680 --> 31:44.488
- The New Yorker?

31:44.489 --> 31:46.687
- Yes, they love your
Holden Caulfield character.

31:46.688 --> 31:49.279
They feel he's completely original.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.759
I'm so happy for you, Jerry.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.205
- The New Yorker, I can't believe it.

31:52.206 --> 31:55.039
- Well believe it, my love.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.166
To publishing.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.168
It really is everything.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.368
Now they have a couple of notes

32:06.369 --> 32:09.679
that they want you to address.

32:09.680 --> 32:10.839
- Notes?

32:10.840 --> 32:11.682
- Yes.

32:11.683 --> 32:14.246
All writers have to go through
this with every magazine.

32:14.247 --> 32:16.439
And the New Yorker has
more notes than most.

32:16.440 --> 32:17.327
They want all their stories

32:17.328 --> 32:20.529
to have a New Yorker signature to them.

32:21.960 --> 32:25.123
- What if I don't want to do the notes?

32:30.040 --> 32:33.010
- They told me their
problems with the story.

32:33.011 --> 32:34.490
Should I tell you?

32:35.880 --> 32:39.799
- Sure, sure, okay,
tell me their problems.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.211
- First off, they think Holden's drinking

32:41.212 --> 32:42.839
comes out of nowhere.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.319
They want it to be
clearer he's an alcoholic.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.045
- No, he's not an alcoholic.

32:47.046 --> 32:48.403
He's just getting drunk

32:48.404 --> 32:49.959
because he's depressed about the girl.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.562
- Well, they
think that's unclear.

32:51.563 --> 32:52.402
- I don't.

32:52.403 --> 32:54.719
I think that's perfectly clear.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.722
- Well maybe you can
make a slight adjustment

32:56.723 --> 32:59.883
so it's not confusing for some people.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.162
Also they think it would
be nice if in the end

33:04.163 --> 33:07.359
Holden and Sally got back together.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.119
They specifically said
we don't need to see it.

33:10.120 --> 33:10.960
We just want the reader

33:10.961 --> 33:12.166
to have a sense that they'll end up...

33:12.167 --> 33:13.599
- But they don't end up together.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.599
That's not what happens.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.406
- Why not?

33:15.407 --> 33:16.242
- Because people don't end up together.

33:16.243 --> 33:18.479
It usually doesn't work out.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.923
Okay, I know in every goddam
story in every goddam magazine

33:20.924 --> 33:23.443
the couple always falls
in love with a stupid kiss

33:23.444 --> 33:24.999
to make us feel all warm and fuzzy

33:25.000 --> 33:26.001
and full of Christmas cheer.

33:26.002 --> 33:28.999
But that's not what happens in real life.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.885
Someone always gets their heart broken

33:30.886 --> 33:32.722
and has a hard time getting over it.

33:32.723 --> 33:35.087
Sometimes they drink
because they're upset,

33:35.088 --> 33:37.970
even though they're not alcoholics.

33:41.280 --> 33:45.365
I just want my writing to
be truthful, that's all.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.439
- So what would you like me to tell them?

33:53.440 --> 33:55.559
- Tell them I'm very open to notes,

33:55.560 --> 33:56.684
but Holden's not an alcoholic

33:56.685 --> 33:57.886
and they don't end up together.

33:57.887 --> 33:59.803
- Those are the only notes, Jerry.

33:59.804 --> 34:03.441
- Well tell them I won't
make those changes.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.449
- You're so talented.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.007
Give Oona a little twirl?

34:28.159 --> 34:29.127
- So get this.

34:29.128 --> 34:30.518
I told Oona about the New Yorker.

34:30.520 --> 34:31.485
- And?

34:31.485 --> 34:32.844
- We've already been out three times.

34:32.846 --> 34:34.438
- To the New Yorker.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.851
- The New Yorker.

34:38.520 --> 34:41.159
- Did they have any notes?

34:41.159 --> 34:42.478
- Who?

34:42.480 --> 34:43.719
- The New Yorker.

34:43.719 --> 34:46.759
Did they have any notes on the story?

34:46.760 --> 34:47.760
- No.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.364
- Well I'm not surprised they loved it.

34:52.364 --> 34:54.438
That Holden character is fantastic.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.929
It's exactly what I've been telling you

34:55.931 --> 34:57.039
about digging deeper.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.769
- Yeah, yeah, I felt it
when I was writing him.

34:58.770 --> 35:00.959
It just flowed out of me.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.325
I want to keep writing stories about him.

35:02.326 --> 35:03.367
- You should.

35:06.880 --> 35:07.880
- Well.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.559
- Another.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.449
- You okay there, boss?

35:15.360 --> 35:19.524
- Well, between you and me,
things aren't great at Story.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.119
Money is tight.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.805
I mean, Martha watches
the finances and me.

35:25.806 --> 35:29.479
Apparently I'm still
spending too much money.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.811
- You'll have to shut it down?

35:30.812 --> 35:33.849
- No, no, we'll be all right for now.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.162
But it's been tough on us.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.407
I got an eye.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.729
I can spot talent coming a mile away.

35:46.640 --> 35:51.439
Saroyan, Cheever, Caldwell,
I discovered them all.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.761
Of course, it would be nice
if somebody discovered me.

35:53.762 --> 35:55.842
- Hey, come on, you've been published.

35:55.843 --> 35:58.239
- I not only discovered them,

35:58.240 --> 36:00.971
I shaped them, I challenged them.

36:03.920 --> 36:04.920
This is me.

36:09.640 --> 36:13.087
You should continue to write about Holden,

36:14.360 --> 36:16.408
but not as a short story.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.290
- Well, hang on, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:19.291 --> 36:20.645
What do you mean?

36:23.120 --> 36:26.249
- I think Holden Caulfield is a novel.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.931
- No, no, I couldn't write a whole novel.

36:30.932 --> 36:32.839
I'm a dash man, not a miler.

36:32.840 --> 36:36.083
- You only say that because you're lazy.

36:37.120 --> 36:41.250
Holden Caulfield deserves an
entire book all on his own.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.484
- A novel's a lot of words.

36:47.485 --> 36:49.369
- It's just more words.

36:52.640 --> 36:57.039
Imagine the book that
you would want to read

36:57.040 --> 36:59.359
and then go write it.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.968
- Hey, Mom, what's wrong?

37:28.640 --> 37:29.919
Mom.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.605
Hey, what is it, what's happened?

37:34.000 --> 37:34.842
- We interrupt this broadcast

37:34.843 --> 37:38.364
to bring you this important
bulletin from the United Press.

37:38.365 --> 37:41.362
We have witnessed this morning
the attack of Pearl Harbor

37:41.363 --> 37:43.249
and the severe bombing of Pearl Harbor

37:43.250 --> 37:46.289
by army planes, undoubtedly Japanese.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.040
It's no joke, it's a real war.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.287
- I don't care what you say.

37:56.288 --> 37:58.244
I'm sending you socks every week

37:58.245 --> 37:59.603
and you had better wear them.

37:59.604 --> 38:01.039
- Please, you'll embarrass me.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.690
They're going to supply
everything I need and...

38:02.691 --> 38:06.079
- Everyone, can I have
your attention please?

38:06.080 --> 38:08.479
As you all know, tomorrow morning

38:08.480 --> 38:11.839
our son Jerry is going off to war.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.922
Perhaps this will turn him into the man

38:13.923 --> 38:16.491
I know he's destined to become.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.084
- And I would like to propose a toast

38:20.085 --> 38:22.162
to the best student I've ever had.

38:22.163 --> 38:25.039
To Jerry, a wonderful writer,

38:25.040 --> 38:27.439
an inspiration, and a great friend.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.839
To Jerry.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.251
- To Jerry.

38:35.920 --> 38:39.322
- This may not be the best
timing but I have some bad news.

38:39.323 --> 38:40.526
- Really, what?

38:41.920 --> 38:42.967
- The New Yorker isn't going to run

38:42.968 --> 38:45.167
the Holden Caulfield story.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.200
- Why not?

38:48.200 --> 38:49.167
- They think it's too frivolous

38:49.168 --> 38:51.731
now that we've entered the war.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.599
I'm sorry, Jerry.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.886
- No, it's fine.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.041
Promise you'll wait for me.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.525
- I promise.

39:16.526 --> 39:17.526
- Really?

39:20.360 --> 39:21.930
- Of course, Jerry.

39:32.080 --> 39:36.079
- Well, she is an actress.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.127
- Hey, hey, mark my words.

39:37.128 --> 39:39.119
I will marry that girl.

39:39.120 --> 39:39.962
- Well it's a good thing her father's

39:39.963 --> 39:43.442
a comedy writer.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.561
- Anyway, how's everything
at the home front with you?

39:47.562 --> 39:49.399
You good with Martha chewing your ear?

39:49.400 --> 39:50.524
- Everything at my home is fine.

39:50.525 --> 39:51.360
- Yeah?

39:51.361 --> 39:52.407
- Because what you'll
learn about having a wife

39:52.408 --> 39:56.041
is that occasionally she just
has to yell to feel better.

39:57.240 --> 40:01.370
Oh, and by the way, I'm awfully
sorry about the New Yorker.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.964
- How'd you know about that?

40:05.965 --> 40:07.079
- Oh please.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.241
They canned the Caulfield story

40:08.242 --> 40:10.125
because you wouldn't
take any of their notes.

40:10.126 --> 40:12.327
You know, you cannot be a pain in the ass

40:12.328 --> 40:14.079
until you're a success.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.080
- Yeah?

40:16.440 --> 40:17.405
Well to hell with the New Yorker.

40:17.406 --> 40:18.206
You know what?

40:18.207 --> 40:20.121
I'll put it in an anthology
with other short stories...

40:20.122 --> 40:21.565
- No, no, no, don't do
that, don't do that.

40:21.566 --> 40:23.642
Don't do that to Holden Caulfield.

40:23.643 --> 40:25.290
He deserves a novel.

40:26.680 --> 40:27.520
- You really think so?

40:27.521 --> 40:28.362
- I know so.

40:28.363 --> 40:30.567
He's a fantastic character.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.159
Listen to me.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.083
While you're over there, you know,

40:35.084 --> 40:39.599
getting clap from all those
French whores, do me a favor.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.409
I want you to write about him.

40:41.410 --> 40:45.519
I want Holden Caulfield
to be your best friend.

40:45.520 --> 40:46.919
And listen to me.

40:46.920 --> 40:49.039
Stay alive, all right?

40:49.040 --> 40:50.040
Stay alive.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.519
No matter what.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.250
- After I enlisted in the army

41:09.251 --> 41:10.765
I bounced from base to base

41:10.766 --> 41:14.481
until they finally
shipped me off to England.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.121
I knew army food would be bad,

41:17.122 --> 41:19.327
but they'd promised us a steak dinner

41:19.328 --> 41:22.130
the night before the big invasion.

41:25.040 --> 41:27.559
I just couldn't start the Caulfield novel.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.846
That's why I kept
sending you short stories

41:28.847 --> 41:32.128
for the anthology I was writing instead.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.686
I had never written anything so personal.

41:35.687 --> 41:38.246
That's why he was a
first person character.

41:38.247 --> 41:40.686
I didn't want to begin Holden's
story because I was scared

41:40.687 --> 41:44.048
I wouldn't live long enough to finish it.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.559
- Hey, Jerry,
how's your girlfriend?

42:16.560 --> 42:17.923
- I wish they'd all just forget about it.

42:17.924 --> 42:18.760
- Bye, lover boy.

42:18.761 --> 42:19.600
- Come on, Jer.

42:19.601 --> 42:20.487
You're the first guy to ever get dumped

42:20.488 --> 42:22.926
on the front page of every
newspaper in the country.

42:22.927 --> 42:24.759
It's pretty nuts.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.879
Chaplain's old enough to be her father.

42:26.880 --> 42:27.722
- Well, what can I say?

42:27.723 --> 42:30.999
Everyone loves that little tramp.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.399
- And a scandal
that has rocked the nation.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.448
The biggest movie star in
the world, Charlie Chaplain

42:35.449 --> 42:37.165
has married the 18 year old daughter

42:37.166 --> 42:39.367
of famed playwright Eugene O'Neill,

42:39.368 --> 42:43.439
who has declared that she has
finally met her true love.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.849
- It's just more words.

43:16.880 --> 43:19.403
- "Holden Caulfield," she said.

43:19.404 --> 43:20.686
"It's marvelous to see you.

43:20.687 --> 43:22.599
"It's been ages."

43:22.600 --> 43:25.166
She had one of those very
loud embarrassing voices

43:25.167 --> 43:26.839
when you met her somewhere.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.081
She got away with it because
she was so damn good looking

43:29.082 --> 43:32.159
that it always gave me a pain in the ass.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.764
"It's swell to see ya," I said.

43:33.765 --> 43:35.239
I meant it too.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.719
"How are ya anyway?"

43:36.720 --> 43:38.759
"Grand," she said.

43:38.760 --> 43:41.719
If there's one word I hate it's grand.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.846
It's so phony.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.402
- This is a momentous hour

44:09.403 --> 44:11.368
in world history, D-Day.

44:12.320 --> 44:13.922
The men of General Dwight D. Eisenhower

44:13.923 --> 44:17.527
are fighting their way up
the beaches in fire and blood

44:17.528 --> 44:20.799
into the fortress of Nazi Europe.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.768
Casualties in this mammoth operation

44:22.769 --> 44:24.888
may reach a dreadful toll.

44:48.280 --> 44:49.202
- I had stormed Normandy

44:49.203 --> 44:51.159
with six chapters in my bag.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.321
And I'd be lying if I didn't tell ya

44:52.322 --> 44:55.839
Holden got me through some rough spells.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.410
He gave me something to focus on

44:57.411 --> 45:00.131
when things weren't going so hot.

45:02.640 --> 45:06.004
That's one of the things I
loved most about writing.

45:06.005 --> 45:07.764
Your mind keeps on working on your stories

45:07.765 --> 45:12.119
whether you've got a pen
or a gun in your hand.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.399
It just never stops creating.

45:25.040 --> 45:25.962
- You okay?

45:25.963 --> 45:28.122
- You've got to help me, just help me.

45:40.800 --> 45:41.800
- Hey, hey.

45:53.320 --> 45:56.085
- I did everything
I could to keep on writing.

45:56.086 --> 45:57.127
I really did.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.359
No pen, no typewriter.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.805
To hell with them.

46:04.440 --> 46:06.602
I kept on telling Holden's story,

46:06.603 --> 46:09.399
even if it was only to myself.

46:09.400 --> 46:13.041
- If I get pneumonia
then I'll probably die.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.841
There'll be millions
of jerks at my funeral.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.806
- Jerry, Jerry.

46:38.120 --> 46:39.724
You're going to be all right, okay?

46:39.725 --> 46:40.839
All right?

46:40.840 --> 46:42.649
You've just got to warm up a bit, okay?

46:42.650 --> 46:44.719
Come on, here we go.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.319
All right.

46:46.320 --> 46:49.529
Hey, hey, you just gotta warm up, okay?

46:53.200 --> 46:55.799
I brought the socks your mom sent you?

46:55.800 --> 46:57.370
She's a smart lady, Jer.

46:57.371 --> 46:59.159
All right, take 'em.

46:59.160 --> 47:01.919
Keep you warm, all right, okay?

47:01.920 --> 47:04.199
I'm not going anywhere.

48:51.640 --> 48:53.051
- Jerry?

49:06.280 --> 49:08.719
Jerry, can you hear me?

49:08.720 --> 49:11.359
Jerry, I want you to look at me.

49:11.360 --> 49:13.647
Could you look at me, Jerry?

49:14.800 --> 49:18.247
Jerry, squeeze my hand if you can hear me.

50:00.040 --> 50:03.839
- I'm truly sorry
you wasted all that time on me.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.524
But you gotta believe me when I tell you,

50:05.525 --> 50:07.727
I have nothing left to say.

50:08.840 --> 50:13.439
About Holden Caulfield or
anything else for that matter.

50:13.440 --> 50:16.091
Sincerely yours, Jerry Salinger.

50:21.083 --> 50:22.759
- He's here.

50:22.760 --> 50:23.799
- Is he still crazy?

50:23.800 --> 50:24.606
- Ssh.

50:24.607 --> 50:25.761
- Welcome home, sonny.

50:25.762 --> 50:28.206
All the way home from Germany.

50:33.360 --> 50:34.360
- Hi Mom.

50:39.800 --> 50:40.839
Doris.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.126
- Jerry.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.400
- Uh, this is my wife, Sylvia.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.969
This is my mom, Miriam.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.648
That's my sister, Doris.

51:06.800 --> 51:08.839
And that's my father, Sol.

51:08.840 --> 51:09.840
- Hello.

51:22.960 --> 51:27.479
Sonny, you were interrogating
Nazis after the war?

51:27.480 --> 51:29.162
- Yeah, we were trying to find out

51:29.163 --> 51:30.924
where the Nazis were hiding.

51:30.925 --> 51:32.809
- That sounds exciting.

51:41.480 --> 51:44.599
- So Sylvia, what do you do?

51:44.600 --> 51:46.409
- She's a rodeo clown.

51:53.160 --> 51:54.160
It's a joke.

51:56.800 --> 52:00.600
- I'm a thermologist by
trade, before the war.

52:01.520 --> 52:04.119
- When did you two get married?

52:04.120 --> 52:05.645
- About six months ago.

52:05.646 --> 52:09.959
- Oh, that's when you stopped
responding to our letters.

52:09.960 --> 52:13.851
- Well I haven't written
a word in over a year.

52:16.160 --> 52:20.439
- Well, I hope you're going
to write stories again.

52:20.440 --> 52:22.761
- Maybe after Whit publishes
the Young Folks anthology.

52:22.762 --> 52:25.809
It's the only reason why I came home.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.129
And to see all of you.

53:03.960 --> 53:06.042
Most of these I wrote
before I went to Europe,

53:06.043 --> 53:08.359
and a few I wrote during the war.

53:08.360 --> 53:09.925
- And what about the Caulfield novel?

53:09.926 --> 53:11.331
Where are you with that?

53:11.332 --> 53:12.879
- About halfway.

53:12.880 --> 53:15.611
- When do you think
you're going to finish?

53:15.612 --> 53:18.279
- Just, I can't work on it anymore.

53:18.280 --> 53:19.120
- Why not?

53:19.121 --> 53:20.451
- It brings back too many memories.

53:20.452 --> 53:22.999
I want to forget it all.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.639
- Well, have you written
anything since you got back?

53:27.640 --> 53:28.640
- I tried.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.885
I just can't do it.

53:33.480 --> 53:35.164
- Well, we'll publish your anthology

53:35.165 --> 53:39.959
and I'll bet before long you'll
be back at that typewriter.

53:39.960 --> 53:40.960
- Hope so.

53:42.760 --> 53:44.728
I'm not getting enough sleep
so it's hard to concentrate.

53:44.729 --> 53:48.202
And sometimes I wake up and I'm screaming.

53:50.520 --> 53:54.650
- These are all very common
post-war symptoms, Jerry, okay?

53:55.720 --> 53:58.485
And have you been painting at all?

54:02.040 --> 54:04.850
- No, no, 'cause I'm not
a painter, I'm a writer.

54:04.851 --> 54:07.207
- Yes, yes of course, writer.

54:08.800 --> 54:09.642
- And no.

54:09.643 --> 54:13.119
With the nightmares I just,

54:13.120 --> 54:17.839
sometimes I have flashbacks of
the camps during the day too.

54:17.840 --> 54:19.001
It's almost like I'm there.

54:19.002 --> 54:20.519
I can smell.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.325
Is there anything I can do for that?

54:22.326 --> 54:24.284
- No, these are all
very common occurrences

54:24.285 --> 54:26.567
from soldiers returning from combat.

54:26.568 --> 54:28.528
It's just a phase, okay?

54:58.320 --> 54:59.320
- Hey.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.400
- Hello.

55:02.240 --> 55:04.159
So you've been drinking.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.559
- No, no I haven't
touched a drop in years.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.402
- Oh, that's right.

55:07.403 --> 55:08.925
You joined a temperance union.

55:08.926 --> 55:10.159
- Joined?

55:10.160 --> 55:11.286
You mean started it.

55:11.287 --> 55:14.119
I also joined the divorce union.

55:14.120 --> 55:16.239
Well kind of more annulled

55:16.240 --> 55:17.683
if you want to get technical about it.

55:17.684 --> 55:18.522
- What happened?

55:18.523 --> 55:20.204
- Something that never should have.

55:20.205 --> 55:22.487
I think she might be a Nazi.

55:25.000 --> 55:25.967
- Are you serious?

55:25.968 --> 55:29.931
- I don't know, maybe.

55:33.680 --> 55:36.126
- Well now see, that is
something you should write about.

55:36.127 --> 55:38.559
Have you started up again?

55:38.560 --> 55:39.402
- No.

55:39.403 --> 55:42.959
Um, you know, I think once
the anthology's published

55:42.960 --> 55:45.799
that'll hopefully get me going again.

55:49.320 --> 55:50.719
What?

55:50.720 --> 55:54.199
- The anthology's just turned out to be

55:54.200 --> 55:57.522
a little more complicated than I thought.

55:58.640 --> 56:00.119
- How?

56:00.120 --> 56:01.722
- Well you know, we
don't publish on our own.

56:01.723 --> 56:02.526
We don't have the money for it.

56:02.527 --> 56:03.885
So we have this
relationship with Lippincott

56:03.886 --> 56:06.039
to finance a long form.

56:06.040 --> 56:08.486
And they've rejected the book.

56:10.120 --> 56:12.279
They don't want to publish it.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.962
- So you're not going to publish
the Young Folks anthology?

56:13.963 --> 56:14.800
- Look, if it was up to me, Jerry.

56:14.801 --> 56:15.642
It's them.

56:15.643 --> 56:17.881
I nearly ended the relationship with them.

56:17.882 --> 56:19.323
- You nearly ended the relationship?

56:19.324 --> 56:20.890
How nearly brave of you
that must have been.

56:20.891 --> 56:22.159
- Come on, come on.

56:22.160 --> 56:23.605
- No, no, no, that means a lot to me.

56:23.606 --> 56:25.879
I mean, you know that was the only reason

56:25.880 --> 56:26.765
I came back from Germany.

56:26.766 --> 56:28.888
You knew how much it meant to
me, how much I needed that.

56:28.889 --> 56:30.206
- At least it brought you home.

56:30.207 --> 56:31.723
- I didn't want to come home.

56:31.724 --> 56:34.004
- Jerry, I'm sorry, there's
nothing I can do, all right?

56:34.005 --> 56:36.002
I went to war with these guys over this.

56:36.003 --> 56:37.359
- War?

56:37.360 --> 56:38.599
War?

56:38.600 --> 56:39.679
War, you went to war with these guys?

56:39.680 --> 56:40.520
- Oh, I'm sorry, no.

56:40.521 --> 56:41.360
That was a bad choice of words.

56:41.361 --> 56:42.200
- You went to war?

56:42.201 --> 56:43.040
- I didn't mean...

56:43.041 --> 56:43.880
- I landed on D-Day.

56:43.881 --> 56:44.720
- I understand...

56:44.721 --> 56:45.526
- No, no, no, no, no.

56:45.527 --> 56:46.442
You have no idea.

56:46.443 --> 56:49.239
I'm only alive because we missed
our landing by 1,000 yards.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.366
But I saw them all get killed.

56:50.367 --> 56:52.639
I saw every single one of them get killed.

56:52.640 --> 56:53.924
I should be dead too, I shouldn't be here.

56:53.925 --> 56:54.726
- Jerry, I'm sorry.

56:54.727 --> 56:55.765
I fought for you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

56:55.766 --> 56:56.600
- I wanted this to happen.

56:56.601 --> 56:58.125
- Don't sit there and tell
me how you fought for this.

56:58.126 --> 57:00.168
You are a liar, you're a goddam liar.

57:00.169 --> 57:02.970
And I never want to see you again.

57:06.880 --> 57:07.880
- Jerry.

57:24.720 --> 57:25.767
- Hey mister.

57:27.080 --> 57:29.208
I have a question for you.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.931
Where do you think the
ducks go in the winter

57:31.932 --> 57:34.127
when the pond freezes over?

57:35.640 --> 57:38.769
- I'm sorry, pal, I ain't got no idea.

57:42.200 --> 57:44.009
Hey, you want a smoke?

57:45.680 --> 57:47.839
- Yeah, thank you.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.763
Hey, you wanna, you want a nip?

57:49.764 --> 57:51.759
- Ooh, don't mind if I do.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.171
- Have you got a light?

57:53.172 --> 57:54.479
- I think I do.

57:59.680 --> 58:01.439
Hey, hey, I'm a veteran.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.680
I'm a veteran, goddam it, stop.

58:06.600 --> 58:08.762
- All right, got it.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.648
- What are you all doing?

59:34.200 --> 59:38.239
I keep having nightmares about
the war almost every night.

59:38.240 --> 59:40.720
Sometimes I wake up screaming.

59:41.960 --> 59:44.930
- Do you also see it during the day?

59:49.480 --> 59:50.879
- How'd you know?

59:50.880 --> 59:52.882
- Before I studied the
teachings of Ramakrishna

59:52.883 --> 59:56.639
I was a freedom fighter in
India against the British.

59:56.640 --> 59:57.971
It was the violence I witnessed

59:57.972 --> 01:00:02.839
that led me on the same
path that has led you to me.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.319
- Do you think the
nightmares will ever go away?

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.320
- Oh yes.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.170
But first you must heal from the violence

01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:12.439
that has been inflicted upon your soul.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440
- How?

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.720
- Right.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.404
Our religion consists of meditation

01:00:19.405 --> 01:00:22.239
on the spirit of full consciousness.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.319
Come.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.810
Remove your shoes.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.881
This is how we will
begin to heal the pain.

01:00:28.882 --> 01:00:31.439
Those are very handsome shoes.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.039
- Thank you.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.040
- Come, sit.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.239
Very good.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.844
Now close your eyes.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.399
It's all right.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.519
I won't hurt you.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.159
Ultimate reality is an all-pervading

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.369
uncreated self-luminous eternal spirit.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.970
It's the consciousness that
animates all conscious beings.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.281
- I, well I try to write.

01:01:34.282 --> 01:01:37.409
Every day I sit at the
typewriter but I can't start.

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:42.279
- What do you think about when
you stare at the blank page?

01:01:43.123 --> 01:01:44.799
- That it won't be good.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.759
That I've lost my talent.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.047
- So what if you have?

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.123
- Then I shouldn't write.

01:01:53.124 --> 01:01:54.884
- You write to show off your talent

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:57.770
or to express what's in your heart?

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.959
- I finally started yesterday.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.768
- Good.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:11.959
- No, it wasn't good.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.768
I mean, the writing was terrible

01:02:12.769 --> 01:02:15.081
and I only managed one page.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.729
- Then what happened?

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.399
Did you enjoy it?

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.242
- Writing?

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:28.322
- No, ripping up the page.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.719
- Yeah.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.091
I ripped up five pages yesterday.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.319
- Sounds like fun.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.967
- Seymour Glass.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.319
"Are you going in the water,
Seymour Glass?" she said.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.401
He suddenly got to his feet.

01:03:33.402 --> 01:03:35.719
He looked at the ocean.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.085
"I'll tell you what we'll do.

01:03:37.086 --> 01:03:40.368
"We'll see if we can catch a bananafish.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.603
"This is a perfect day for bananafish."

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.291
- Well, I love what you've
done with the place.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.479
You're writing again.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480
- Mm-hm.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.119
- The Caulfield novel?

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.639
- No, no.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.479
I tried but...

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.322
- Thank you.

01:04:15.323 --> 01:04:18.005
- It's just some short
stories I've been working on.

01:04:18.006 --> 01:04:19.359
- Mm.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.200
- They're not very good,

01:04:20.201 --> 01:04:21.281
but at least I'm getting pages clone.

01:04:21.282 --> 01:04:23.119
- Well, that's why I'm here.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:23.962
You remember that story

01:04:23.963 --> 01:04:25.924
that the New Yorker was going to publish?

01:04:25.925 --> 01:04:29.079
- Slight Rebellion Off Madison,
my first Caulfield story.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:29.922
- Well, they've been reviewing

01:04:29.923 --> 01:04:31.843
all their past submissions
from before the war

01:04:31.844 --> 01:04:34.446
and they are considering publishing it.

01:04:34.447 --> 01:04:35.799
- Really?

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.926
- Yes, really.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.082
I don't know if you remember,

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:43.839
but they had specific notes
you didn't want to take.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.081
And if you want them to publish it

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:49.641
you're going to have
to make their changes.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.399
Oh come on, at least hear them out.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.448
Publishing is everything.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.566
- Well the New Yorker
holds a special place

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:02.359
in American literature.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.089
And it's important to us that our stories

01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:06.199
have a uniform vision.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.324
We want the reader to
be able to read a story

01:05:08.325 --> 01:05:11.721
and know that it could
only run in the New Yorker.

01:05:11.722 --> 01:05:13.881
- That's exactly what I don't want.

01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:17.089
- You don't want to be
published in the New Yorker?

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:19.639
- No, no, I love the New Yorker.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.644
I just don't want to write
stories like everyone else.

01:05:22.645 --> 01:05:26.679
You know, the war hero
doesn't always get a parade.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.319
Sometimes he blows his head off.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.799
I want to create a new form of writing,

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.599
a modern form about modern society

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.602
in which is the pain of our existence

01:05:36.603 --> 01:05:40.161
is laid out truthfully
for everyone to see.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.803
- I'll make a deal with you.

01:05:45.804 --> 01:05:48.243
If you try the notes
and don't feel they make

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:51.923
your story better, then I'll
submit your original version.

01:05:51.924 --> 01:05:54.559
- I don't want Holden and
Sally to end up together.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.844
That's not what happens in real life,

01:05:55.845 --> 01:05:56.807
at least not in my life.

01:05:56.808 --> 01:05:57.923
- Well that's fine.

01:05:57.924 --> 01:05:59.599
It's just a thought we had.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.523
- I thought it was a big
sticking point for you.

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:04.599
- Not if you feel it destroys
the integrity of the piece.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.443
Look, Jerry, I'm not trying
to take your story over

01:06:06.444 --> 01:06:08.044
or write it for you.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.879
You have a wonderful voice
but you over-explain.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.439
Trust that the reader's
going to understand you.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.359
- What do you mean I over-explain?

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.326
That's better.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.879
Your notes worked.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.802
Thanks.

01:06:43.803 --> 01:06:45.719
- You're welcome.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.007
I'll submit it to Harold
Ross and the team.

01:06:48.008 --> 01:06:51.641
It should take a few
weeks to get an answer.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.441
- I wanted to give you
another story I wrote.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.519
I thought you could
help me make it better.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.359
- Well shouldn't bananafish be two words?

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.919
- No, it has to be one.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.079
- Why?

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.129
- Because two words would
make too much sense.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.767
- Dear Jerry.

01:07:16.768 --> 01:07:20.124
I've sent you several letters
but you never respond.

01:07:20.125 --> 01:07:21.724
I hope you believe me when I tell you

01:07:21.725 --> 01:07:23.679
there was nothing I could do.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.331
I begged them to publish it, I really did.

01:07:26.332 --> 01:07:29.159
And now I'm begging for your forgiveness.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.571
Because I truly...

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.371
- I've read several of your stories

01:07:34.372 --> 01:07:38.410
and they're very impressive
for someone your age.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:43.246
- My writing changed a lot after the war.

01:07:43.247 --> 01:07:45.561
- The war changed a lot of writers.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.608
- The ones that survived.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.159
- Jerry, I brought you here today

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.844
because I wanted to tell you personally

01:07:52.845 --> 01:07:56.606
that the New Yorker would
like to publish you.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.846
- Which story?

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.686
- All of them.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.321
- All of them?

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.927
- I would like to offer you
a first rejection contract.

01:08:12.928 --> 01:08:14.490
We'll pay you a handsome yearly salary.

01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:18.399
And in return we get to read
all of your stories first.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:20.082
The ones we don't publish,

01:08:20.082 --> 01:08:22.401
you're free to sell to other magazines.

01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:26.450
- It's the most prestigious
contract in American publishing.

01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:29.444
- Congratulations, Jerry, you did it.

Peggy Sisken.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.520
- Very nice to meet you.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.839
- The New Yorker's incipient
great man of American letter.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.682

01:08:47.683 --> 01:08:48.839
I am also a writer.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.682
- Fantastic.

01:08:49.683 --> 01:08:52.363
- I thought Uncle Wiggily in
Connecticut was marvelous.

01:08:52.363 --> 01:08:54.600
I'm simply dying for your next story.

01:08:54.602 --> 01:08:56.600
- When Seymour Glass shot himself,

01:08:56.602 --> 01:08:58.325
you weren't just talking about the war.

01:08:58.326 --> 01:08:59.921
You were talking about the bourgeois

01:08:59.923 --> 01:09:02.486
capitalist infrastructure
of a modern plutocracy.

01:09:02.487 --> 01:09:04.038
- Or maybe it was the war.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.279
But it's really up to the reader.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:08.439
- Jerry is in the very
beginnings of his first novel.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.122
- And Bill says you
may be writing a novel.

01:09:10.122 --> 01:09:11.085
- When are you going to write a novel?

01:09:11.086 --> 01:09:12.921
- Well, you know, there's
something I'm working on.

01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:13.840
Hopefully it won't be too long.

01:09:13.841 --> 01:09:14.648
- Let's get a picture.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:16.359
- Oh, thank you so much.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:20.198
- Shall we have a picture?

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.200
Here we are.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.729
♪ Jing a ling jing a ling

01:09:29.731 --> 01:09:33.158
♪ Jing a ling jing a ling jing a ling

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.451
- There's one thing that's
been weighing on me.

01:09:52.452 --> 01:09:56.679
A novel I'm trying, wanting
to finish but can't.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.809
I'm scared if I work on it
the nightmares will come back.

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:01.279
- Is it about the war?

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.681
- No, it's about a character
I wrote about during the war.

01:10:03.682 --> 01:10:06.119
He was with me everywhere I went.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.690
- Every time you attempt to work on it

01:10:07.691 --> 01:10:09.523
you feel the war again.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.321
- You know, you never really get the smell

01:10:13.322 --> 01:10:16.959
of burning flesh out of your nostrils.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.124
- Perhaps finishing this book
is the way for you to move on.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.240
- Right.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.126
There's just so many
distractions everywhere.

01:10:28.127 --> 01:10:30.759
- Then you must remove distractions.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.205
- Well, this is it.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.891
It gets a little drafty
but the price is right.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.568
What are you going to do up here?

01:11:07.569 --> 01:11:09.847
- Oh, just a little writing.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.089
- I'll just tell
you about this madman stuff

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:07.161
that happened to me around last Christmas.

01:12:08.162 --> 01:12:10.970
Just before I got pretty run down.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.481
Finally what I decided I'd
do, I decided I'd go away.

01:12:15.482 --> 01:12:17.125
I decided I'd never go home again.

01:12:17.126 --> 01:12:18.999
I'd never go away to another school again.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.081
That way I wouldn't have to have

01:12:20.082 --> 01:12:24.244
any goddam stupid unless
conversations with anybody.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.444
I keep picturing all these little kids

01:12:30.445 --> 01:12:34.239
playing some game in this
big field of rye and all.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.527
Thousands of little kids,
and nobody's around.

01:12:36.528 --> 01:12:38.921
Nobody big I mean, except me.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.045
And I'm standing on the
edge of some crazy cliff.

01:12:44.046 --> 01:12:46.202
What I have to do, I
have to catch everybody

01:12:46.203 --> 01:12:48.919
if they start to go over the cliff.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.445
I mean if they're running
and they don't look

01:12:50.446 --> 01:12:52.329
where they're going, I have to come out

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:54.800
from somewhere and catch them.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.399
And that's all I'd do all day.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.927
I'd just be the catcher
in the rye and all.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.966
I know it's crazy, but
that's the only thing

01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:10.769
I'd really like to be.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.519
- Jerry.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.362
- Hi,

01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:16.673
- Thanks so much for stopping by.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.520
- Oh, thank you.

01:13:17.521 --> 01:13:18.440
- It's great to meet you.

01:13:18.441 --> 01:13:19.519
- Mr. Giroux, it's a pleasure.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.326
- Robert.

01:13:20.327 --> 01:13:21.160
Please, call me Robert.

01:13:21.161 --> 01:13:22.000
- Robert.
- Have a seat.

01:13:22.001 --> 01:13:22.840
- Thank you.

01:13:22.841 --> 01:13:24.046
- Such an honor to have you here.

01:13:24.047 --> 01:13:26.324
- No, I'm sorry for
stopping by unannounced.

01:13:26.325 --> 01:13:28.288
I just wanted to speak to you personally.

01:13:28.289 --> 01:13:30.039
- No apologies necessary.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.399
- I don't know if you
remember, but a year ago

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.209
you sent me the kindest
letter about my writing

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.521
asking if you could publish
a book of my short stories.

01:13:36.522 --> 01:13:39.719
- Of course, I love those stories.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.959
- Thank you.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.962
I just completed my first novel

01:13:42.963 --> 01:13:46.601
and if you like, I'd
like you to publish it.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.079
- Ah, I am honored you'd think of me.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.605
When can I read it?

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360
- Hm.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.931
You know, the pages of
this book were with me

01:14:10.932 --> 01:14:14.599
when I stormed the beaches of Normandy.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.046
I wrote them in Hitler's death
camps and in the hospital

01:14:17.047 --> 01:14:20.522
where I could barely remember my own name.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.204
I don't think I'd be alive
if it wasn't for this book.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.966
- I'm really flattered, Jerry.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.970
Is it a war story?

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.959
- No.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.090
It's about a troubled kid
during the Christmas holidays.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.644
- Well I know you wanted us to give you

01:14:50.645 --> 01:14:52.205
some helpful notes on the novel.

01:14:52.206 --> 01:14:55.807
But the truth is, we both
think it has a lot of problems.

01:14:55.808 --> 01:14:57.928
- I just don't buy Holden.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.039
- That's the whole book.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.639
- Well he seems phony,
as he would like to say.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.721
He's so negative all the time.

01:15:05.722 --> 01:15:07.402
It just doesn't feel real.

01:15:07.403 --> 01:15:09.209
- And your style is too writer-conscious.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:13.319
I feel you're trying to be
clever on almost every page.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.129
- Did you at least think it was funny?

01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:16.919
- Um.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.524
- Yes, but in a way where I feel

01:15:18.525 --> 01:15:20.519
the writer's being too witty.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.559
- You're making a real name for yourself

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.607
and I would hate for this book

01:15:23.608 --> 01:15:25.999
to throw all that goodwill away.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.047
The best note I can give ya

01:15:27.048 --> 01:15:31.011
is to just put it in a
drawer for a year or two.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.999
- It's that bad?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.525
- I'm afraid it is.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.850
- I loved it, Jerry, I really did.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.359
- Thank God.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.170
- But these things are never easy.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.239
- What do you mean?

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.559
- My boss didn't get it.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.479
But I fought for it and he
said he'd be willing to publish

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.721
if you did a major rewrite.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.199
- What does he want rewritten?

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.839
- He doesn't understand
Holden, what makes him tick.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.879
And I gotta admit, I found
him confusing at times.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.530
He hates everything.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.967
And he's always so sarcastic.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.886
Is Holden supposed to be crazy?

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.519
Are you okay?

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520
Jerry?

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.400
Jerry?

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.046
- No, I've thought about it
and I can't do a rewrite.

01:16:53.047 --> 01:16:54.405
I won't do it, I'm not
going to change a word.

01:16:54.406 --> 01:16:55.806
Holden would never approve.

01:16:55.807 --> 01:16:57.484
- You might not have to.

01:16:57.485 --> 01:16:58.799
- What do you mean?

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.325
- Look, I didn't tell you
I was going to do this.

01:17:00.326 --> 01:17:03.319
But I sent it to one person,
just to test the waters.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.287
- Who?

01:17:04.288 --> 01:17:06.959
- John Woodburn at Little, Brown.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.564
- Okay, well how was the water?

01:17:08.565 --> 01:17:09.846
- Hot, very hot.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.446
- He liked it?

01:17:12.447 --> 01:17:13.759
- No, he loved it.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.569
He thinks it's an American masterpiece.

01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:17.319
- He said masterpiece?

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.599
- That's what he said.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.442
- Yeah.

01:17:19.443 --> 01:17:24.039
And wait, you told him I
wouldn't make any changes?

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.279
- Yes, I told him that
that could be a problem,

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.486
and he still wants to meet with you

01:17:27.487 --> 01:17:29.562
to discuss marketing and distribution.

01:17:29.563 --> 01:17:31.559
- Hold on, marketing?

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.562
- We also love this one for the cover,

01:17:33.563 --> 01:17:36.040
Holden in his red hunting hat.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080
- I hate it.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.239
- So what's wrong with this one?

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.004
- The reader needs to
imagine for themselves

01:17:44.005 --> 01:17:46.959
what they want Holden to look like.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.847
- What if we just
use it for the galleys?

01:17:48.848 --> 01:17:49.682
I think it would really...

01:17:49.683 --> 01:17:50.999
- Mm-mm, no.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.001
I don't want any galleys sent out.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:56.083
- Advanced copies are crucial
for publicity purposes.

01:17:56.084 --> 01:17:58.159
- I don't want any publicity.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.969
- You don't want any publicity?

01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:01.319
- No.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.084
I don't care if it's successful.

01:18:03.085 --> 01:18:05.279
I just want it to be good.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.361
The less attention the book gets,

01:18:06.362 --> 01:18:08.806
the more the story will affect people.

01:18:08.807 --> 01:18:12.799
- It won't affect anyone
if they don't read it.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.847
- Well I'm not doing press.

01:18:13.848 --> 01:18:17.447
This isn't about me or
publicity or reviews.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.524
This is about Holden.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.999
- Jerry, do you want
us to publish this book

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.759
or merely to print it?

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.522
Because if you just want a printer,

01:18:30.523 --> 01:18:32.807
then I suggest you type
up a few hundred copies

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:35.007
and send them out yourself.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.522
- Fine, you can send out
galleys for advance reviews.

01:18:41.523 --> 01:18:43.199
- Thank you, Jerry.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.487
That's very generous of you.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.529
- But I don't want to
read a single review.

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:51.639
So don't send them to me, okay?

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.451
- Receiving rapturous reviews,

01:18:56.452 --> 01:18:59.683

I feel like I'm Holden Caulfield.

And I jump, I need to talk to you

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.727
about the book, about Holden.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:58.251
- Everything I have to
say I wrote in the book.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.330
- How do you know so much about me?

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680
- I don't.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.967
It's just a work of fiction.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.768
I'm just a fiction writer.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.599
Thank you for saying hello.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.965
- But I'm Holden.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.129
I'm Holden Caulfield.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.765
You're phony, like everyone else.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.039
- Sorry, I didn't want to wake you.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.088
- No, no, no, you didn't.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.091
I was always worried you wouldn't
be able to pay your rent.

01:21:53.092 --> 01:21:57.165
Now I gotta worry about
deranged fans attacking you.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:04.239
You should take your photo
off all those book covers.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.359
- I never knew you worried at all.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.806
- Since the day you were born.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.287
When I was a boy I wanted to be a pianist.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.728
I loved playing so much.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.601
But my father was a rabbi so
he just couldn't understand

01:22:26.602 --> 01:22:29.799
how I would be able to support myself,

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.485
and he forced me to stop playing.

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.639
I was upset.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.529
But I knew he loved me.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.767
He just wanted me to be okay.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.399
- I never even heard you play.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.129
- No, but I was good.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.770
So, you're Holden Caulfield, right?

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.160
- Yeah.

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.039
- Your mother was right.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.849
You are very talented.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.400
- Thank you.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:30.559
- Now you just got to write
another one even better.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.560
No pressure.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.805
Good night, sonny.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.802
- I hear people talking about
Catcher everywhere I go.

01:23:53.803 --> 01:23:55.879
Everyone just loves it.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.719
- I'm so excited
to read your next book.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.719
- Is your steak okay?

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.881
- Yeah, I'm just not very hungry.

01:24:03.882 --> 01:24:05.609
- Could we get you something else maybe?

01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:06.886
- No, excuse me.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.519
- You okay?

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.931
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.682
- You know, there's a dinner
party going on in there.

01:24:33.683 --> 01:24:37.810
- Yeah, I'm just a little
uncomfortable right now.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.810
- It's just a book.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:42.962
I didn't even like it that much,

01:24:42.963 --> 01:24:45.440
if you want to know the truth.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.531
- What didn't you like about it?

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.764
- It was just like all
those other phony books.

01:24:55.765 --> 01:24:59.399
A lot of whining and the
ending was a lousy bore.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.284
You shouldn't take yourself
so seriously, you know.

01:25:06.285 --> 01:25:10.410
It's not like you're the
first guy to write a hit book.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.167
- Wait, wait.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.007
Can I get your phone number?

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160
- Got a pen?

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.607
- And I got some paper too.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.599
What's your name?

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.090
- Claire.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.759
You're the first person that's
ever said they hated it.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.000
- To your face.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.440
- Thank you.

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:11.324
- You have captured the
consciousness of the nation.

01:26:11.325 --> 01:26:12.965
You've tapped into the way many feel,

01:26:12.966 --> 01:26:15.004
and have given a voice to their pain.

01:26:15.005 --> 01:26:16.439
- Well I can't go home anymore.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.601
I wrote the book to get over the war

01:26:17.602 --> 01:26:21.239
and now I feel like I'm
going crazy all over again.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:25.370
- Have you not yet learned
how to remove distraction?

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.119
- New Hampshire's really
beautiful this time of year.

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.719
It's 90 acres, mostly woods.

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.879
The house is modest but very nice.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:43.927
There's also a small bunker

01:26:43.928 --> 01:26:46.959
that can be converted to a guest house.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.999
- Or an office.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.639
- Whatever you want.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:52.610
I think you'll be really happy here.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.965
- Well I hope so.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.244
- An artist's only concern

01:27:10.245 --> 01:27:13.559
is to shoot for some kind of perfection.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.919
And on his own terms, not anyone else's.

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.239
- Excuse, Mr. Salinger.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:19.207
Since you write about teenagers

01:27:19.208 --> 01:27:22.249
I thought you might be interested
in running a youth group.

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.559
I think the kids would love it.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.368
- I would too.

01:27:25.369 --> 01:27:26.519
- Great.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.479
They're right over here.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.288
- Yet a real artist,

01:27:29.289 --> 01:27:32.250
I've noticed, will survive anything.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.080
- Jerry?

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.411
You invite me all the way out here

01:27:46.412 --> 01:27:48.607
and then walk away as soon as you see me?

01:27:48.608 --> 01:27:50.039
- No, I'm sorry.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.611
I thought you were one of
those crazed Caulfield fans.

01:27:52.612 --> 01:27:54.479
- You should be so lucky.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.209
- You look beautiful.

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.405
What do you think?

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.641
- It's just as you said in your letters.

01:28:03.642 --> 01:28:06.007
It's like the city without the city.

01:28:06.008 --> 01:28:07.239
- Do you hate it?

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.639
- I grew up in foster homes, Jerry.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:13.610
As long as you're here it's perfect.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:19.761
- Her skin was lovely

01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:22.679
and her features were delicate.

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.761
No one could have missed saying

01:28:23.762 --> 01:28:26.570
that she was a first class beauty.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.603
He's overjoyed with
his new spiritual life.

01:28:31.604 --> 01:28:34.888
And he goes on saying his
prayer and telling everyone

01:28:34.889 --> 01:28:38.679
he happens to meet how to say it too.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.919
- Hey, Mr. Salinger.

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.161
I know you're very private,
but I was wondering

01:28:43.162 --> 01:28:45.799
if I could interview you
for my school newspaper.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.928
They want me to write an
article about someone I admire.

01:28:47.929 --> 01:28:49.649
And you'd be perfect.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.840
- Well I stopped doing
interviews a while ago.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.839
But for a school paper I can
certainly make an exception.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:01.680
- Really?

01:29:01.681 --> 01:29:02.520
- Of course.

01:29:02.521 --> 01:29:03.487
- The kids at school are going to love it.

01:29:03.488 --> 01:29:05.319
Thank you, thank you.

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.891
Is Catcher in the Rye autobiographical?

01:29:07.892 --> 01:29:09.079
- Sort of.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.406
My boyhood was very much the same

01:29:10.407 --> 01:29:12.243
as that of the boy in the book.

01:29:12.244 --> 01:29:16.039
You know, I had problems
in school just like he did.

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.930
To be honest, it was a great
relief telling people about it.

01:29:18.931 --> 01:29:23.050
- And why do most of your
stories center on young people?

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.759
- Because they're innocent

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:34.810
and they haven't been
destroyed by the world yet.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.205
I guess part of me wishes I
could still be that innocent.

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:39.406
But I've seen the things I've seen

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:42.768
and I'll never have that innocence again.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.921
- That girl who interviewed you

01:29:50.922 --> 01:29:53.639
the other day was very pretty.

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.199
- So?

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.679
- So you seem to like pretty young girls.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.399
- Yes, that would put me

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:03.200
in that special
classification known as a man.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:09.882
- Well I hope you still love me

01:30:09.883 --> 01:30:12.611
when I'm not a pretty young girl.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.810
- Of course I will.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.680
No.
- What?

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.326
- That interview, the
interview with the girl.

01:30:33.327 --> 01:30:37.279
It was printed in the local
paper, not the school paper.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.319
- So?

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.719
- So she lied to me.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.279
She said it was for the school paper.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.120
She lied.

01:30:42.121 --> 01:30:42.960
- It's okay, Jerry.

01:30:42.961 --> 01:30:43.800
It's going to be okay.

01:30:43.801 --> 01:30:44.640
- No, I trusted her.
- Jerry, it's okay.

01:30:44.641 --> 01:30:45.641
- I trusted her.

01:30:45.642 --> 01:30:47.449
She betrayed me.
- It's okay.

01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:51.679
- How dare those goddam
children betray me now.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.879
- When people
become the distraction

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.929
then I suppose you remove the people.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.399
- There hasn't be a single mention of me

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.839
or Story Magazine in any of the
press, not a single mention.

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.682
- That's because you have no

01:31:13.683 --> 01:31:15.565
official involvement in the book.

01:31:15.566 --> 01:31:17.403
- But I published his first story.

01:31:17.404 --> 01:31:19.359
I'm the one who convinced him

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.679
that Holden Caulfield should be a novel.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:22.919
- Well, you would have been the publisher

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.283
of the hottest novel of the year

01:31:24.284 --> 01:31:26.601
if you'd published his
anthology like you promised him.

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:38.211
- I haven't slept for six months.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.560
And I miss him.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:45.207
- Well I'm sorry about that.

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.845
- Lippincott says that they'll publish

01:31:48.846 --> 01:31:50.808
an anthology now, anything he wants.

01:31:50.809 --> 01:31:52.959
- Everyone wants an anthology.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:55.244
But we're going with Little,
Brown out of loyalty,

01:31:55.245 --> 01:31:56.924
although I hate the title.

01:31:56.925 --> 01:31:59.491
Nine Stories, it's such a bore.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.319
- Do you think Jerry would
write a piece for Story?

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.606
It doesn't have to be a new piece.

01:32:06.607 --> 01:32:09.319
It could be an old story, it's fine.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.519
We're just really struggling.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.329
- I already asked him.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.560
He said no.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.922
- How can he still be angry with me?

01:32:24.923 --> 01:32:26.959
He's a huge success now.

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.159
- It hasn't been easy on him.

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:30.399
The war made him a better writer

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.687
but it really messed him up.

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.845
- It seems
to me indisputably true

01:32:40.846 --> 01:32:43.241
that artists and poets
who have a reputation

01:32:43.242 --> 01:32:45.479
for producing a great or fine art

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:48.919
have something garishly
wrong with them as persons,

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.046
a spectacular flaw in character

01:32:50.047 --> 01:32:52.919
or an extreme self-centeredness.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.082
And the public's thirst for
their next supposed masterpiece

01:32:55.083 --> 01:32:59.210
only makes them want to hide
from distractions even more.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.719
- You've been in that studio
for over a week, Jerry.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.963
All week writing about the Glass family.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.085
We're alone here, Jerry.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.322
You can't just leave us along like this.

01:33:19.323 --> 01:33:21.129
We're your family too.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.330
I have no friends here,
I have no one to talk to.

01:33:28.331 --> 01:33:29.526
I am all alone.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.600
I'm alone.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.603
- He's absolutely
unfit for marriage

01:33:45.604 --> 01:33:47.807
or anything halfway normal.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.802
It's a sad fact that the end of one story

01:33:50.803 --> 01:33:53.879
always seems to grow into
the start of a new one.

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:54.927
And the tragedy is there's simply

01:33:54.928 --> 01:33:57.559
nothing he can do about it.

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.201
- Please, you know you're not
supposed to bother me in here.

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.799
- I know.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.043
But you have a phone call
and he says it's important.

01:34:06.044 --> 01:34:07.079
- Why?

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:07.922
Who is it?

01:34:07.923 --> 01:34:09.126
- Whit Burnett.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:17.249
- No, no, I don't want to talk to him.

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.759
- You'd think with all that meditation

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.809
you'd have learned to forgive by now.

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:48.928
- Hello.

01:34:48.929 --> 01:34:50.879
- Jerry, hi.

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.239
It's been a long time.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.287
- Yes it has.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.050
- I never got a chance to tell you

01:34:58.051 --> 01:35:00.964
but I just loved Catcher in the Rye.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.280
- Thank you.

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:04.441
It was your idea to write it.

01:35:04.442 --> 01:35:06.999
- Well, it's one thing to have an idea.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.126
It's another thing to execute it,

01:35:08.127 --> 01:35:10.327
and you did so brilliantly.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.479
- Thank you.

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.843
- How's life in the country?

01:35:13.844 --> 01:35:14.725
I understand...

01:35:14.726 --> 01:35:15.642
- It's fine, Whit.

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:17.449
What can I do for you?

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.847
- Are you still angry about what happened?

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.411
- Is that why you called?

01:35:26.412 --> 01:35:30.799
- No, no, I called because,
look, Story Magazine

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.959
is going to do an
anthology of short stories.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.450
And since you're our most famous alumni

01:35:34.451 --> 01:35:36.919
I just thought it would be fitting

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.810
if you did the introduction for us.

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.240
Hello.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.160
- Okay.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:52.762
- Okay, what?

01:35:52.763 --> 01:35:54.679
- Okay, I'll do it.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.680
- Really?

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.085
- Yeah, you sound surprised.

01:35:58.086 --> 01:36:00.039
- No, no, I'm just thrilled.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.371
I, I, thank you.

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:06.927
- No, thank you for buying my first story.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.159
- Well it was the best $25 I ever spent.

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.881
- When I was 20
I was a student for a time

01:36:18.882 --> 01:36:21.925
in Whit Burnett's short
story course up at Columbia.

01:36:21.926 --> 01:36:23.645
I often have my doubts whether any good

01:36:23.646 --> 01:36:25.642
and conscientious writing course conductor

01:36:25.643 --> 01:36:27.639
can humanly do more.

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:31.770
He was there unmistakably
in the service of the story.

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.359
- It isn't too quiet for you out here?

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.119
- No, it's perfect.

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.168
- But don't you miss
the action in the city?

01:36:41.169 --> 01:36:43.119
- It's just a distraction.

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.359
It's all a distraction.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.124
It's important I remove anything

01:36:46.125 --> 01:36:48.839
that can interfere with my writing.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.283
All I want now is to write.

01:36:50.284 --> 01:36:52.203
- Yeah, but don't you
have less to write about?

01:36:52.204 --> 01:36:53.799
You're so isolated.

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.450
I mean, look, I liked Franny and Zooey.

01:36:55.451 --> 01:36:57.839
It's just it felt a little bit more

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.119
like reading a religious
textbook than a story.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:06.199
- You always told me
to dig deeper, correct?

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.042
- Yes.

01:37:07.043 --> 01:37:09.399
- I couldn't have written
Catcher without the war.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.731
But now I'm seeking a higher calling

01:37:10.732 --> 01:37:12.399
than a boy in his hunting hat.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.242
- Wait a minute.

01:37:13.243 --> 01:37:14.679
Holden changed the country.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:15.919
There's now young people
all over the world

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.491
who feel they finally have a
voice they never had before.

01:37:18.492 --> 01:37:22.799
- Yes, and they're not afraid
to come here and tell me.

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.479
Sometimes I wish I never wrote it.

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.766
I do, it's made me a prisoner here.

01:37:26.767 --> 01:37:28.119
I'm shackled by my own creation.

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.406
- Oh come on, does it
have to be like that?

01:37:29.407 --> 01:37:30.439
- Yes.

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.771
If I want to keep writing, it does.

01:37:31.772 --> 01:37:36.359
And that's the only time
I feel any sense of peace.

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:39.842
It's nice to see you again but I'm curious

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.759
why you wanted to come all
the way up here to talk to me.

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.331
- It's about the introduction you wrote.

01:37:47.332 --> 01:37:50.239
Look, I loved it, it's beautiful.

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.239
I was very flattered.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.127
- Well I'm glad you enjoyed it.

01:37:52.128 --> 01:37:55.010
- But unfortunately I can't use it.

01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.839
- You can't use it?

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:00.684
- No, because it's not
about Story Magazine

01:38:00.685 --> 01:38:02.119
or the other writers.

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:04.599
It's about me and it's just inappropriate

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.639
to use as an introduction
for an anthology.

01:38:07.483 --> 01:38:09.209
Why are you laughing?

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.126
- Ever since we've met all
you've clone is reject my writing.

01:38:13.127 --> 01:38:16.404
I guess I was foolish to
think that would end now.

01:38:16.405 --> 01:38:19.768
- Well, I never said life as
a writer was going to be easy.

01:38:19.769 --> 01:38:22.081
- As always, you were right.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.320
Bye, Whit.

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.400
- Good bye.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.479
- As always there are multiple offers

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.045
for the film rights to Catcher.

01:39:23.046 --> 01:39:25.884
Elia Kazan, Billy Wilder,
they both keep calling.

01:39:25.885 --> 01:39:28.239
- Tell them no and to stop calling.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.810
It'd never work as a movie.

01:39:29.811 --> 01:39:30.879
- Why not?

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.159
- 'Cause I'm the only
one that can play Holden.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.160
I'm too old.

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.043
- Little, Brown called
about your next book.

01:39:38.044 --> 01:39:41.442
They asked if you were still
writing about the Glass family.

01:39:41.443 --> 01:39:44.922
They'll take anything, literally anything.

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.805
- No, there's something I
want to talk to you about.

01:39:47.806 --> 01:39:52.639
It's actually the reason
why I came back to the city.

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.687
- What is it?

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:00.365
- I don't want to publish anymore.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.800
- But people really love
to read your stories.

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.849
You'll have so many disappointed fans.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.728
- My writing's, it's become my religion.

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.199
Publishing, it gets in
the way of the meditation.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.406
It corrupts it.

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.679
I don't know how to be a husband,

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.919
or a father, or even a friend.

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:35.959
All I know is how to be a writer.

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.281
If I can truly do this, if I can dedicate

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:42.519
my life to writing and
get nothing in return,

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:45.729
then I think I can find some happiness.

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.521
- Then don't publish anymore.

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:59.079
I love you and I want you to be happy.

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.210
And it's like I always said,
publishing isn't everything.

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:23.279
- Dear Whit.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:26.568
So to answer the question you
asked me all those years ago.

01:42:26.569 --> 01:42:30.439
Yes, I am willing to write
for the rest of my life

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.568
and get nothing in return.

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:36.051
Sincerely yours, J.D. Salinger.
