WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:06.640
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER":
THREE PAIRS REMAINED IN THE

00:06.674 --> 00:14.048
GAME, MAVEN, JOSH-MISH, AND
JALEX.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.384
PAUL POSITIONED HIMSELF WITH
EACH DUO.

00:16.417 --> 00:20.521
>> BOTH HAVE PROGRESSED SO MUCH
IN THE GAME, IT'S LIKE WATCHING

00:20.554 --> 00:21.489
MY CHILDREN GROW.

00:21.522 --> 00:25.226
I'M PRETTY SURE NOBODY THINKS
THIS IS A THING.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.460
IT'S A TEAM EFFORT.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.429
I SAID THAT FROM DAY ONE.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.099
>> Announcer: MEANWHILE, KEVIN
WAS THE ODD MAN OUT.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.101
>> KEVIN IS TOTALLY SHADY.

00:33.134 --> 00:36.304
YOU HAVE NO LOYALTY TO THIS MAN.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.372
SPHWHROW WITH THE POWER UP FOR
GRABS--

00:38.406 --> 00:39.340
>> OH, MAN!

00:39.373 --> 00:45.646
>> I LOVE YOU, JASON.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.481
>> ME, TOO.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.817
>> Announcer: JASON WAS THE
LAST WEANER STANDING.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.051
>> CONGRATULATIONS, JASON.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.421
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.257
>> Announcer: AND THE COWBOY
WANTED TO TAKE A SHOT AT MAVEN.

00:56.290 --> 01:00.228
>> NOW I GET TO PUT MATT AND
RAVEN ON THE BLOCK.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.763
THEY'RE A DUO.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.499
WE DON'T NEED THEM AS A NUMBER
ANYMORE.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.768
>> Announcer: A PLAN WAS
FORMED TO MAKE IT APPEAR KEVIN

01:07.801 --> 01:11.071
WAS THE TRUE TARGET.

01:11.105 --> 01:18.212
>> I WILL DOUBLE CHECK WITH HIM,
BUT I THINK, YEAH.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.347
AND.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.781
>> Announcer: AND MAVEN BOUGHT
IT HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.850
>> THEY WANT TO BACKDOOR KEVIN.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.353
WE'VE JUST GOT TO WIN VETO.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.854
>> WORKS FOR HE.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.923
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
THEY'RE SO CALM AND BUYING ALL

01:29.957 --> 01:31.359
OF THIS RIGHT NOW.

01:31.392 --> 01:36.897
EITHER I'M GETTING SWINDLED AND
BAMBOOZLED AND I SUCK, OR

01:36.930 --> 01:39.633
THEY'RE REALLY JUST THIS
COMFORTABLE WITH ME.

01:39.667 --> 01:43.103
>> Announcer: AT THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY...

01:43.137 --> 01:51.245
>> I'VE NOMINATED YOU, RAVEN,
AND YOU, MATT HOPEFULLY JASON

01:51.279 --> 01:56.584
STAYS TRUE TO HIS WORD AND KEVIN
GOES UP THERE AND WE BACKDOOR

01:56.617 --> 01:57.218
HIM.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.452
SORRY, BUD, YOU HAVE TO GO.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.254
>> Announcer: TONIGHT, THE
POWER OF VETO IS ON THE LINE.

02:00.288 --> 02:03.857
WILL IT SAVE MAVEN OR SEAL THEIR
FATE?

02:03.891 --> 02:08.596
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

02:08.629 --> 02:11.899
>> WHAT WAS YOUR G.P.A.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.233
GRADUATING?

02:12.266 --> 02:13.601
>> DANCE.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.278
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS

02:57.311 --> 03:00.514
ADJOURNED.

03:00.548 --> 03:05.152
SO I NOMINATE MATT AND RAVEN TO
PUT ON THE BLOCK.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.088
THEY THINK THEY'RE PAWNS AND
IT'S A BACKDOOR FOR KEVIN.

03:08.121 --> 03:08.956
NOT THE CASE.

03:08.989 --> 03:09.990
THEY'RE A SHOWMANCE.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.859
IT'S TIME TO BREAK THE SHOWMANCE
UP.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.227
THERE'S NO BACKDOOR HERE.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.929
THERE'S JUST ONE OVER-SIZED DOOR
WITH MATT'S NAME ON IT.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.531
>> WOULDN'T BE THE BLOCK WITHOUT
ME.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.799
>> YEAH.

03:18.832 --> 03:23.070
>> SO RAVEN AND I GET NOMINATED,
AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD WE'RE PAWNS

03:23.103 --> 03:25.172
AND KEVIN IS THE ACTUAL TARGET,
BUT THIS IS "BIG BROTHER," AND

03:25.205 --> 03:33.046
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.149
>> IT'S NERVE-RACKING BEING ON
THE BLOCK, AND I SURE AS HECK

03:36.183 --> 03:40.254
DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT ON THE
BLOCK WITH MY MAN, MATT, COME

03:40.288 --> 03:41.054
THURSDAY.

03:41.088 --> 03:44.157
>> I'M FEELING AT HOME UP THERE,
MAN.

03:44.191 --> 03:54.234
>> SO ONE OF US NEEDS TO GO WIN
THAT VETO, AND BRING IT ON HOME.

03:54.234 --> 04:03.076
>> SO ONE OF US NEEDS TO GO WIN
THAT VETO, AND BRING IT ON HOME.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.481
>> IT WASN'T SUBTLE BUT--
>> THE SPEECH, I WASN'T

04:07.515 --> 04:07.981
EXPECTING THAT.

04:08.015 --> 04:13.587
>> I WASN'T, EITHER.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.457
HE GOES, "DON'T WORRY, I'LL PULL
YOU OFF.

04:16.490 --> 04:16.824
OF.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.058
>> PERFECT.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.827
MATT AND RAVEN ARE ON THE BLOCK
AND, OF COURSE, I HAVE TO TELL

04:19.860 --> 04:23.096
THEM THAT THEY'RE FINE, EVEN
THOUGH I KNOW THEY'RE NOT.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.734
>> IF I GET HOUSEGUEST PICK, I'M
PICKING YOU.

04:26.767 --> 04:31.539
>> I POSITIONED MYSELF IN SUCH A
WAY WHERE I PRETTY MUCH KNOW ALL

04:31.572 --> 04:34.074
ANGLES OF WHAT EVERYBODY IS
THINKING BUT I HAVE TO TELL THEM

04:34.107 --> 04:36.377
WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR AND ACT
LIKE I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

04:36.410 --> 04:39.513
IT.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.714
>> HOW YOU DOING, PAL?

04:40.748 --> 04:41.682
>> I'M DOING GOOD.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.050
>> YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.253
I THOUGHT YOU DID FANTASTIC.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.457
>> EVEN IF THEY WIN THE P.O.V.,
THE OTHER ONE'S GONE.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.724
>> BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.193
YOU DON'T KNOW.

04:53.226 --> 04:58.432
BECAUSE-- WELL, I GUESS WE KIND
OF DO KNOW.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.633
KEVIN IS MY PAL.

04:59.667 --> 05:03.637
WE DO A LOT OF STUFF TOGETHER,
BUT PEOPLE ARE REALLY TO START

05:03.671 --> 05:06.940
NOT TRUST HIM AND IT'S GETTING
HARDER AND HARDER FOR ME TO

05:06.974 --> 05:07.641
PROTECT HIM.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.977
IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION TO BE IN.

05:10.010 --> 05:13.414
UNLESS IT'S A BALLERINA SPINNING
COMPETITION.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.582
>> WE'LL SEE.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.451
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT AND JINKS
US, BUT WE'LL BE HERE IN A

05:17.485 --> 05:21.855
COUPLE OF WEEKS, TOO.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.060
>> YOU THINK HE'S FOR REAL?

05:27.094 --> 05:28.295
>> YES.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.099
>> BUT, LIKE, IF HIM AND ALEX
WIN THE VETO, YOU THINK THEY'RE

05:32.132 --> 05:33.901
LITERALLY GOING TO PULL US OFF?

05:33.934 --> 05:37.304
>> WELL, IF THEY DON'T, ONE OF
US GOES HOME AND THEN ONE OF

05:37.337 --> 05:40.273
THEM JOINS JURY RIGHT AFTER US.

05:40.307 --> 05:45.579
>> YEAH, TRUE.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.716
I'D FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE
IF ONE OF US WINS THE VETO.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.318
>> HOPEFULLY I WIN AND I CAN
PULL MYSELF OFF.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.686
YOU WIN, YOU PULL YOURSELF OFF.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.988
>> I'LL PULL YOU OFF IF I WIN.

05:55.022 --> 05:55.789
>> NO!

05:55.823 --> 05:57.090
>> OF COURSE, I WILL.

05:57.124 --> 06:00.160
>> IT'S IMPORTANT THEY WIN THIS
VETO COMPETITION SO THAT I CAN

06:00.193 --> 06:03.196
TAKE RAVEN OFF THE BLOCK BECAUSE
SHE NEEDS AND DESERVES TO STAY

06:03.230 --> 06:06.166
IN THIS GAME A LOT MORE THAN I
DO.

06:06.199 --> 06:14.708
I DON'T THROW MY GIRL UNDER THE
BUS.

06:14.742 --> 06:24.351
* *
* *

06:45.939 --> 06:54.281
* *
>> WHY DOES KEVIN DO THIS?

07:03.991 --> 07:07.461
>> I THINK HE THINKS HE LOOKS
GOOD.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.930
>> WHY DOES HE MAKE THAT FACE?

07:09.963 --> 07:14.001
>> I THINK IT'S, LIKE, "OH,
YEAH, YOU LOOK HOT."

07:14.034 --> 07:15.536
>> IT DRIVES ME CRAZY.

07:15.569 --> 07:19.206
I'M LIKE, "WHAT THE  ARE
YOU DOING?"

07:19.239 --> 07:20.641
DOES EVERYBODY HATE KEVIN?

07:20.674 --> 07:21.809
>> NOBODY HATES HIM.

07:21.842 --> 07:22.710
HE JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.813
>> I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN'T
HATE HIM.

07:25.846 --> 07:26.647
WHY?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.582
>> HE'S MEAN TO ME, HE'S MEAN TO
PAUL.

07:28.616 --> 07:33.286
HE'S MEAN TO JOSH.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.822
PLUS, HE SIDE-EYES EVERYONE.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.356
IF YOU'RE JUST STANDING THERE...

07:36.389 --> 07:39.660
THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO SEND
HOME THE SHOWMANCES, BUT SINCE

07:39.693 --> 07:42.896
KEVIN HAS BEEN GETTING ON MY
NERVES, I WOULDN'T MIND SENDING

07:42.930 --> 07:44.364
HIM HOME THIS WEEK.

07:44.397 --> 07:48.068
THE ONE THING JASON CAN'T STAND
IS PEOPLE WHO ARE MEAN AND

07:48.101 --> 07:50.871
MALICIOUS AND I AM TRYING TO
CONVINCE HIM THAT KEVIN IS THE

07:50.904 --> 07:53.541
MEANEST AND MOST MALICIOUS
PERSON IN THIS HOUSE JUST SO HE

07:53.574 --> 07:56.710
UNDERSTANDS HOW DANGEROUS KEVIN
IS FOR HIS GAME.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.546
HIS MANNERISMS ARE VERY STRANGE.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.782
FOR LOVING HIS KIDS, YOU WOULD
SAY, "WANT TO SEE A PICTURE FROM

08:01.815 --> 08:05.152
MY KIDS OR MY WIFE OR A LETTER
FROM HOLLY."

08:05.185 --> 08:06.620
>> HE SAYS BOTTLED WATER.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.289
>> WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME NOW.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.726
PEOPLE ARE GETTING WIGGED OUT
AND STUFF.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.864
WE CAN'T JUST KEEP PUTTING HIM
UP AS A PAWN WE NEED TO PUT HIM

08:16.897 --> 08:20.433
UP THERE AND MAKE IT STICK ONE
AND DONE.

08:20.467 --> 08:24.437
>> I TAKE WHAT ALEX SAYS TO
HEART.

08:24.471 --> 08:27.474
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S TRYING TO
BAIT ME INTO SOMETHING HERE

08:27.507 --> 08:29.209
BECAUSE I'M H.O.H. OR WHAT.

08:29.242 --> 08:37.317
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

08:40.187 --> 08:42.022
>> HEY, EVERYBODY!

08:42.055 --> 08:45.726
IT'S TIME TO PICK PLAYERS FOR
THE VETO COMPETITION!

08:45.759 --> 08:51.932
JOIN ME IN THE LIVING ROOM!

08:51.965 --> 08:54.902
ONLY SIX PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE
IN THE VETO COMPETITION-- THE

08:54.935 --> 08:59.339
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, TWO NOMINEES,
AND THREE OTHER PLAYERS SELECTED

08:59.372 --> 09:00.240
BY RANDOM DRAW.

09:00.273 --> 09:06.747
WILL THE NOMINEES PLEASE JOIN ME
UP HERE?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.682
I PUT MATT AND RAVEN ON THE
BLOCK.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.917
MATT'S THE TARGET.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.720
I'M KIND OF HOPING PAUL AND ALEX
GET PICKED TO PLAY IN THE VETO

09:12.753 --> 09:16.590
SO IF ONE OF US WINS THE VETO,
WE SHOULD HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.492
I, AS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, AND THE
TWO NOMINEES WILL EACH PULL A

09:19.526 --> 09:21.862
CHIP OUT OF THE BOX TO DETERMINE
THE THREE OTHER PLAYERS

09:21.895 --> 09:23.631
COMPETING IN THE VETO
COMPETITION.

09:23.664 --> 09:35.175
AS H.O.H., I WILL PICK FIRST.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.076
JOSH.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.611
>> YES!

09:37.645 --> 09:42.616
>> I'M PUMPED BECAUSE I WANT TO

09:42.650 --> 09:45.452
WINT VETO AND MAKE SURE THAT ME
AND MY GIRL CHRISTMAS ARE SAFE

09:45.485 --> 09:46.820
THIS WEEK.

09:46.854 --> 09:58.531
>> PAAAAUL.

09:58.565 --> 10:05.973
>> THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD

10:06.006 --> 10:10.744
MESS UP MATT AND I'S WEEK IS IF
KEVIN'S NAME GOT DRAWN FOR THE

10:10.778 --> 10:11.344
VETO.

10:11.378 --> 10:17.284
HE NEEDS TO BE BACKDOORED.

10:17.317 --> 10:21.521
KEVIN.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.222
.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.924
>> THAT'S TWO WEEKS SITTING OUT!

10:23.957 --> 10:28.929
>> SO WE ARE AT THE POINT IN THE
GAME NOW WHERE THERE IS NO MORE

10:28.962 --> 10:30.497
WINNING ON YOUR SOCIAL SKILLS.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.200
EVERYONE IS PARANOID AND YOU
HAVE TO START WINNING

10:33.233 --> 10:34.401
COMPETITIONS.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.037
SO I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT THERE
AND WIN THAT POWER OF VETO.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.407
>> "BIG BROTHER" WILL INFORM US
WHEN THE COMPETITION IS TO

10:40.440 --> 10:40.741
BEGIN.

10:40.774 --> 10:41.675
GOOD LUCK!

10:41.709 --> 10:44.511
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO THROW IT OR

10:44.544 --> 10:45.212
GUN IT?

10:45.245 --> 10:45.979
>> GUN IT.

10:46.013 --> 10:49.516
>> OKAY, SO IF I WIN, I PULL
GILSY?

10:49.549 --> 10:50.183
>> YES.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.785
>> I GOT PICKED TO PLATE VETO.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.155
NOW I'M GOING TO REALLY TRY TO
WIN THIS THING BECAUSE IF I WIN,

10:55.188 --> 10:59.893
I CAN PULL RAVEN OFF, THEN JASON
HAS TO PUT UP CIFN, STIR THE POT

10:59.927 --> 11:10.037
A LITTLE BIT, BUT MY HANDS ARE
SQUEAKY CLEAN.

11:10.037 --> 11:15.242
A LITTLE BIT, BUT MY HANDS ARE
SQUEAKY CLEAN.

11:15.275 --> 11:19.612
>> GONE.

11:23.450 --> 11:27.287
>> ME, TOO.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.355
AND WE KEEP... THE SAME.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.689
>> 100%.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.424
>> DO YOU THINK I SHOULD TAKE A
NAP?

11:31.458 --> 11:31.725
>> NO.

11:31.759 --> 11:37.965
>> OKAY.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.605
>> DO IT, MAN.

11:45.638 --> 11:45.906
JUST TRY.

11:45.939 --> 11:50.043
>> OKAY.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.716
>> YEAH.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.686
>> IT WILL PUT HIM ON HIS TOES A
LITTLE BIT.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.320
>> EXACTLY.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.156
>> AND MAYBE HE'LL QUIT...

12:03.190 --> 12:05.525
AROUND AND SAYING ALL THAT
STUPID STUFF.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.462
>> EVEN THOUGH THE RUSE WAS THAT
MATT AND RAVEN WERE PAWNS, SO WE

12:09.496 --> 12:12.265
COULD SEND KEVIN OUT, I NEVER
REALLY HAD PICTURED FOLLOWING

12:12.299 --> 12:15.602
THROUGH WITH THE STEPS AND
ACTUALLY HAVING TO PUT KEVIN UP

12:15.635 --> 12:16.469
THERE.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.138
I FEEL REALLY FISHY ABOUT THE
SITUATION.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.541
SO NOW I JUST HAVE TO MAKE DANG
SURE I WIN THIS VETO SO I CAN

12:21.574 --> 12:25.312
HAVE SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT
HOW I'M GOING TO EXECUTE THIS

12:25.345 --> 12:25.913
DEAL.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.547
>> SO YEAH, WE'RE GOLDEN.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.961
YES!

12:40.994 --> 12:42.963
YES!

12:42.996 --> 12:44.064
YES!

12:44.097 --> 12:49.402
>> I WALK INTO THE BACKYARD, I
SEE POOL TOYS, A CABANA.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.138
THIS IS GOING TO BE A RELAXING
DAY.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.941
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO PLAY IN THE
VETO.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.343
ALL I'M MISSING IS A CABANA BOY.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.312
>> WELCOME TO THE HIDE AND GO
VETO POOL PARTY.

12:59.346 --> 13:03.316
EACH OF YOU WILL BE SEPARATED
INTO PRIVATE POOL-SIDE CABANAS

13:03.350 --> 13:05.785
AND MAY NOT COMMUNICATE WITH ONE
ANOTHER.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.321
ONE AT A TIME YOU'LL ENTER THE
HOUSE AND HAVE THREE MINUTES TO

13:08.355 --> 13:09.489
HIDE YOUR VETO CARD.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.826
ONCE ALL THE VETO CARDS HAVE
BEEN HIDDEN, YOU'LL TAKE TURNS

13:12.860 --> 13:15.929
SEARCHING THROUGH THE HOUSE TO
FIND YOUR OPPONENTS' VETO CARDS.

13:15.963 --> 13:20.200
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL VETO
CARDS LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME, SO

13:20.233 --> 13:24.171
YOU WON'T KNOW WHICH
HOUSEGUEST'S VETO CARD ARE YOU

13:24.204 --> 13:25.372
BRINGING BACK.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.741
ONCE A VETO CARD IS FOUND, IT
WILL BE PLACEOLD WANT RESULTS

13:28.775 --> 13:29.977
BOARD.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.880
AFTER THE FIFTH VETO CARD HAS
BEEN FOUND, WE'LL UNLOCK THEM TO

13:32.913 --> 13:34.848
SEE WHO HAS BEEN ELIMINATED FROM
THE GAME.

13:34.882 --> 13:38.385
THE HOUSEGUEST WHO HIDES THEIR
VETO CARD THE BEST WILL WIN THE

13:38.418 --> 13:40.988
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

13:41.021 --> 13:46.393
SO WHO'S READY TO PLAY "HIDE AND
GO" VETO!

13:46.426 --> 13:47.427
>>
.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.061
>> YEAH, YEAH!

13:48.095 --> 13:50.931
>> RAVEN, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.935
>> MATTHEW AND I ARE ON THE
BLOCK THIS WEEK, AND IF I PULL

13:54.968 --> 13:59.306
MYSELF DOWN, JASON HAS TO PUT
KEVIN UP, SO THIS GIRL NEEDS TO

13:59.339 --> 14:00.307
WIN.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.575
>> YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO
HIDE YOUR VETO CARD.

14:02.609 --> 14:03.776
READY.

14:03.810 --> 14:04.711
SET.

14:04.744 --> 14:09.282
>> IN THIS COMPETITION, THE GOAL

14:09.316 --> 14:13.320
IS TO FIND THE BEST HIDING SPOT
FOR YOUR VETO, AND AT THE END OF

14:13.353 --> 14:21.594
THE COMPETITION, WHOEVER'S VETO
CARD IS LEFT IS THE WINNER.

14:21.628 --> 14:30.003
I PUT MY VETO IN A COUCH CUSHION
IN THE ROWE ROSE.

14:30.037 --> 14:33.106
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
COME IN, TOSS THE CUSHION AND

14:33.140 --> 14:36.743
PUT MORE STUFF ON TOP OF IT AND
NOT REALIZE IT'S THERE.

14:36.776 --> 14:37.710
I FEEL GREAT ABOUT IT.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.847
>> AND RAVEN IS BACK FROM HIDING
HER VETO.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.117
>> IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I WIN
THIS VETO COMPETITION, BECAUSE

14:44.151 --> 14:47.520
IF KEVIN DOES WIN THE PROBABLY
WON'T USE TAND THAT WILL LEAVE

14:47.554 --> 14:49.356
RAVEN AND MYSELF ON THE BLOCK
FOR GOOD.

14:49.389 --> 14:54.527
SO I NOTICED QUITE A WHILE BACK
THAT ONE OF THE UNDERARM RESTS

14:54.561 --> 14:58.465
IN THE PARLOR ACTUALLY MOVES UP,
SO AS SOON AS I SAW THIS

14:58.498 --> 15:08.508
COMPETITION, I KNEW THAT'S WHERE
I WANTED TO HIDE IT.

15:08.541 --> 15:18.986
* *

15:19.019 --> 15:22.489
>> AS LONG AS MATT AND RAVEN
DON'T WIN THE P.O.V., I THINK

15:22.522 --> 15:24.057
WE'LL BE GOOD THIS WEEK.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.659
EVERYTHING WILL WORK THE WAY WE
PLANNED.

15:26.693 --> 15:30.363
I FIGUREIDE OPEN UP A PILLOW,
PUT TWO PILLOWS BESIDE IT, STUFF

15:30.397 --> 15:31.531
IT BACK IN.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.699
MAN, I HID IT GOOD.

15:32.732 --> 15:36.736
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:36.769 --> 15:39.806
>> I FEEL LIKE I PULLED MY
GROIN.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.209
>> HIS HOT DOG HAS BEEN SPLIT.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.577
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GO OUT
AND WIN THIS VETO.

15:44.611 --> 15:49.049
THAT MEANS I HAVE ALL THE POWER
AS H.O.H. AND THE POWER OF VETO

15:49.082 --> 15:49.716
HOLDER.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.152
SO I CAN CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS.

15:52.185 --> 15:56.556
SO WITH THE SIZE OF THE VETO
CARD, IT'S ALMOST OBTUSE.

15:56.589 --> 16:00.527
SO WHY NOT JUST HIDE IT IN AN
OBVIOUS SPOT, LIKE THE COUCH

16:00.560 --> 16:02.662
CUSHION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
LIVING ROOM?

16:02.695 --> 16:08.635
THEY MIGHT BE IN SUCH A FRENZY,
THEY'LL GO RIGHT BY IT.

16:08.668 --> 16:12.505
>> MATT'S THE TARGET THIS WEEK,
SO I WANT TO HAVE CONTROL OF THE

16:12.539 --> 16:15.275
VETO BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP
MYSELF AND MY GIRL CHRISTMAS

16:15.308 --> 16:16.443
SAFE.

16:16.476 --> 16:21.748
NONE OF THESE MEAT BALLS ARE
GOING TO SEARCH THE FRIDGE.

16:21.781 --> 16:26.586
SO I GOT MY VETO CARD, I PUT IT
INTO THE FREEZER, AND I THINK

16:26.619 --> 16:28.755
THAT IS GOING TO BE REAL CHILL
BACK THERE.

16:28.788 --> 16:34.294
>> I'VE GOT TO WIN THIS VETO
COMPETITION BECAUSE I HAVE TO

16:34.327 --> 16:36.463
KEEP MYSELF SAFE AND PULL RAVEN
OFF THE BLOCK.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.432
I THINK THE LAST PLACE THAT
ANYONE IS GOING TO THINK THIS

16:39.466 --> 16:41.501
VETO IS, IS HANGING FROM
SOMETHING.

16:41.534 --> 16:46.739
SO I'M GOING TO TIE UP A KNOT
UNDERNEATH ONE OF MY SHIRTS,

16:46.773 --> 16:50.310
SLIP THAT VETO IN THERE LIKE A
BABY BEING CRADLED AND COVER IT

16:50.343 --> 16:53.380
ALL CAN MY JACKET, AND, BOOM!

16:53.413 --> 16:59.719
IT'S THE WORLD'S HEAVIEST
TRIPLE-COTTEN DENIM VETO.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.021
>> RAVEN, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.257
>> YAY!

17:04.291 --> 17:05.458
>> ALL RIGHT!

17:05.492 --> 17:09.296
>> ALL RIGHT, RAVEN, YOU HAVE
TWO MINUTES TO FIND YOUR VETO

17:09.329 --> 17:09.996
CARD.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.231
READY.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.165
.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.468
>> YEAH!

17:15.502 --> 17:19.439
I'M A PRETTY SNEAKY PERSON.

17:19.472 --> 17:27.580
SO WHERE WOULD I HIDE THE VETO
IF I WAS SOMEONE ELSE?

17:27.614 --> 17:31.818
RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO GO TO THE
ROSE ROOM AND DESTROY IT.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.020
NO ONE'S GOING IT TO LOOK
THROUGH THAT.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.958
IT WILL JUST MOVE ON, AND MY
VETO CARD WON'T BE FOUND.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.329
RU.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.665
>> THE FIRST THING THAT I WANT
TO DO IS CHECK ALL THE SPOTS

17:45.698 --> 17:47.200
THAT I PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OF.

17:47.234 --> 17:51.638
SO I CHECKED THE TOP OF THE
FRIDGE.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.073
I START CHECKING ALL OF THE
DRAWERS.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.809
AND I START CHECKING IN BETWEEN
ZIP-UP PILLOWS.

17:56.843 --> 18:11.691
AFTER THAT, I GO AHEAD AND JUST
START TEARING EVERYTHING APART.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.427
I HAVE FOUND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

18:14.461 --> 18:22.269
>> IF I WAS A VETO CARD, WHERE

18:22.302 --> 18:23.436
WOULD I HIDE?

18:23.470 --> 18:26.273
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M PRETTY
MUCH JUST GOING TO GO NUTS AND

18:26.306 --> 18:28.007
SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.311
I'M LOOKING IN EVERY CRACK,
EVERY CORNER, AND I'M FINDING

18:31.344 --> 18:33.413
THESE BABIES, WHETHER THEY LIKE
IT OR NOT.

18:36.249 --> 18:40.753
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE HOW FAST
THIS MEATBALL CAN MOVE.

18:40.787 --> 18:47.794
>> I AM LIKE A BULL WITH A
BLINDFOLD IN A CHINA SHOP WITH

18:47.827 --> 18:57.937
EIGHT ENERGY DRINKS IN ME, AND
FIMADE THIS MEAS AT MY HOUSE IN

18:57.970 --> 18:58.838
MIAMI.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.240
I'M SORRY, MOM, THIS IS JUST FOR
THE VETO.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.007
I PROMISE.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.041
.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.912
>> OH, NO!

19:05.945 --> 19:08.315
THEY THREW MY CLOTHES OUT?

19:08.348 --> 19:11.718
MY FIRST TIME IS, THE SHOWS A
MESS, SO I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED

19:11.751 --> 19:13.720
PEOPLE WOULD ACT LIKE THAT.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.555
MAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE?

19:15.588 --> 19:17.924
I THINK IT'S VERY DISRESPECTFUL.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.492
SOME OF THEM THINK IT'S THE
GAME.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.894
THEY PROBABLY DON'T CLEAN THEIR
ROOMS.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.030
THEIR PARENTS PROBABLY CLEAN
THEIR ROOMS.

19:24.063 --> 19:24.997
.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.966
>> OH, MAN, MY GROIN!

19:26.999 --> 19:30.303
RIGHT OFF THE BAT, I WANT TO
CHECK THE BATTLE ROOM FOR THE

19:30.337 --> 19:31.170
STACK OF TOWELS.

19:31.204 --> 19:35.408
THAT WOULD BE A NICE SPOT TO
SLIP IT IN.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.977
NO TOWELS.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.880
THE OBVIOUS PLACE FOR THE SIZE
OF THIS THING WOULD BE THE

19:40.913 --> 19:42.048
BOTTOM OF THE FREEZER.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.652
SURELY NO ONE'S GOING TO PUT IT
IN THERE, BUT I'M GOING TO

19:45.685 --> 19:46.853
CHECK.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.290
SOMEONE REALLY MUST HAVE HAD A
BRAIN FREEZE, BECAUSE IT LOOKS

19:50.323 --> 19:54.060
LIKE SOMEONE'S GOT A SPOTLIGHT
SHINING ON THIS RED VETO.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.728
>> HERE COMES JASON.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.497
HE HAS THE FIRST VETO CARD.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.366
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.

19:59.399 --> 20:03.503
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

20:03.536 --> 20:04.003
OH!

20:04.036 --> 20:04.737
OH!

20:04.771 --> 20:05.071
OH!

20:05.104 --> 20:07.039
>> GOT IT!

20:07.073 --> 20:07.607
.

20:07.640 --> 20:13.846
>> HE RAN INTO THE WALL!

20:13.880 --> 20:18.217
.

20:18.251 --> 20:22.589
>> IF I CAN'T FIND ANY OF THESE
DAMN VETOES, AT LEAST I CAN GO

20:22.622 --> 20:25.458
CHECK IN ON MINE AND SEE IF IT'S
STILL THERE.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.726
WHAT THE HELL!

20:26.759 --> 20:29.996
MAYBE MESS A FEW THINGS UP, MAKE
IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT,

20:30.029 --> 20:32.299
AND I'M GOLDEN.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.766
.

20:33.800 --> 20:45.845
>> THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL I'M
CLEANING THIS HOUSE AFTER THIS!

20:45.878 --> 20:50.149
A CONDOM STASH!

20:50.182 --> 20:51.918
WHAT THE HELL!

20:51.951 --> 20:57.690
I MEAN, THE VETO COMP IS FOR
SAFETY, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT I'M

20:57.724 --> 20:58.525
LOOKING FOR.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.861
I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS
CABINET.

21:01.894 --> 21:10.036
>> I FEEL WAY POWERLESS WITHOUT

21:10.069 --> 21:11.904
MY COWBOY HAT ON.

21:11.938 --> 21:18.110
YOU DIRTY... I GO FIND MY COWBOY
HAT, NOT IN THE SPOT THAT I LEFT

21:18.144 --> 21:20.313
IT, BUT STILL IN PERFECT SHAPE.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.114
I PUT IT BACK ON.

21:22.148 --> 21:26.753
I INSTANTLY FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.888
LET'S COWBOY UP.

21:28.921 --> 21:34.361
>> I RUN INTO THE WAVE ROOM, AND

21:34.394 --> 21:37.564
I LOOK AT THE ARM REST, AND I
SEE A VETO CARD, AND IT'S JUST

21:37.597 --> 21:38.398
KIND OF LAYING THERE.

21:38.431 --> 21:45.071
AND I'M LIKE, IS THIS A JOKE?

21:45.104 --> 21:45.572
OKAY.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.506
AND I RUN BACK OUT.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.040
GOT MY FIRST ONE.

21:48.074 --> 21:51.978
I'M JUST HOPING IT'S NOT MATT'S
OR PAUL'S.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.312
>> AWESOME, RAVEN.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.681
YOU HAVE GOTTEN THE SECOND VETO.

21:54.714 --> 21:55.715
YOU ARE GOOD.

21:55.748 --> 21:59.151
GO AHEAD AND PUT IT ON THE
BOARD.

21:59.185 --> 22:12.565
TWO VETOES HAVE BEEN FOUND.

22:12.599 --> 22:13.466
.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.334
>> I HAVE TO FOCUS HERE.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.136
THEY RIPPED EVERYTHING OUT OF
HERE.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.337
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.739
REALLY.

22:19.772 --> 22:24.010
REALLY?

22:24.043 --> 22:25.878
MAN, THEY THREW MY SOCKS AND
EVERYTHING OUT.

22:25.912 --> 22:26.779
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.881
MY NEW COAT OUT.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.751
I HAVE MY SUITS HANGING UP NICE
AND CLEAN.

22:31.784 --> 22:37.424
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOT A
SIX-BY-EIGHT-INCH BOARD GOING

22:37.457 --> 22:38.625
THROUGH MY SUIT JACKETS.

22:38.658 --> 22:42.294
YOU HAVE TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT
YOUR CLOTHING, HAVE IT LOOK

22:42.328 --> 22:43.229
NICE.

22:43.262 --> 22:47.800
THESE PEOPLE SHOULD HIDE MONEY
FOR THE BANK.

22:47.834 --> 22:48.901
CONDOMS?

22:48.935 --> 22:50.703
THEY CAN HIDE THE THING BUT
CAN'T HIDE THEIR CONDOMS?

22:50.737 --> 22:56.843
DAMN!

22:56.876 --> 23:00.312
COME ON, YOU HAVE TO THROW MILK
OUT?

23:00.346 --> 23:08.488
>> YOU UNZIP THIS PILLOW, AND I

23:08.521 --> 23:10.957
HEAR ANGELS SINGING.

23:10.990 --> 23:15.327
I AM SO HAPPY!

23:15.361 --> 23:23.135
THAT'S VETO NUMBER TWO FOR THIS
ARC ANSASSY GIRL.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.004
>> THREE VETOES HAVE BEEN FOUND.

23:25.037 --> 23:29.108
OKAY, THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S
ONLY TWO CARDS LEFT TO BE FOUND.

23:29.141 --> 23:35.615
>> WHOA!

23:35.648 --> 23:39.418
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

23:39.452 --> 23:40.252
OW!

23:40.286 --> 23:50.597
>> IT HAS TO BE IN THIS DAMN

23:50.630 --> 23:53.800
ROOM BECAUSE I SEARCHED THIS
WHOLE HOUSE.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.901
WHY!

23:54.934 --> 23:55.968
>> I'M LOOKING ABSOLUTELY
EVERYWHERE FOR THESE VETOES.

23:56.002 --> 24:05.612
I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING NO
PROGRESS WHATSOEVER.

24:05.645 --> 24:10.049
AND THEN I THINK OF ONE SPOT
WHERE I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T LOOKED.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.485
AND, OF COURSE, BOOM.

24:12.519 --> 24:15.221
>> ALL RIGHT MATT!

24:15.254 --> 24:17.123
I FINALLY FIND A VETO.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.726
AT THIS POINT, THIS IS THE
FOURTH VETO THAT'S BEEN FOUND.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.694
THAT MEANS THERE'S ONE MORE
LEFT.

24:21.728 --> 24:25.464
I'M JUST HOPING THAT THE ONE
THAT ISN'T FOUND IS EITHER MINE

24:25.498 --> 24:26.899
OR RAVEN'S.

24:26.933 --> 24:30.637
>> FOUR VETOES HAVE BEEN FOUND.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.572
>> OH, DANG!

24:32.605 --> 24:33.740
FOUND MINE.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.908
SO EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR THE
LAST CARD.

24:35.942 --> 24:39.211
IT HAS LITERALLY BEEN FOREVER.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.613
JUST FOR REAL QUICK MEASURE.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.314
I'VE BEEN THROUGH EVERY ROOM
THREE TIMES.

24:42.348 --> 24:43.950
I'VE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING FOUR
TIMES.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.317
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.019
WHERE COULD IT POSSIBLY BE?

24:47.053 --> 24:47.887
I'M LOOKING UP.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.788
I'M LOOKING DOWN.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.691
I'M LOOKING IN EVERYTHING,
PILLOWS AND ALL.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.324
NOTHING.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.960
IT'S GOT TO BE IN HERE MAN!

24:53.993 --> 24:56.763
HOW CAN WE NOT FIND THIS CARD?

24:56.796 --> 25:04.270
>> WHERE ARE THESE VETOES
HIDDEN?

25:04.303 --> 25:07.774
* *
>> THE FIFTH CARD HAS BEEN

25:07.807 --> 25:08.675
FOUND.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.543
CONGRATULATIONS, JASON.

25:10.577 --> 25:13.746
>> OH!

25:13.780 --> 25:14.947
YEAH!

25:14.981 --> 25:17.049
>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, IT LOOKS
LIKE ALL BUT ONE OF THE VETO

25:17.083 --> 25:18.217
CARDS HAVE BEEN FOUND.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.352
IT'S TIME FOR THE BIG REVEAL.

25:20.386 --> 25:25.491
>> YEAH!

25:25.524 --> 25:29.495
>> AT THIS POINT, I'M JUST

25:29.528 --> 25:31.530
EITHER RAVEN OR I REALLY NEED TO
PULL THIS THING OFF.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.778
>> YEAH!

25:45.812 --> 25:50.149
>> THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY REALLY
TRUST IN THIS GAME ARE RAVEN AND

25:50.182 --> 25:51.383
PAUL.

25:51.417 --> 25:55.655
SO BEST-CASE SCENARIO, ONE OF
THE THREE OF US WINS IT, AND THE

25:55.688 --> 25:57.624
WORST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE
KEVIN WINNING IT.

25:57.657 --> 26:02.261
>> JASON, YOU FOUND THE FIRST
VETO CARD.

26:02.294 --> 26:07.299
>> I'M ALMOST 100% CERTAIN THAT
MY VETO HAD GOTTEN FOUND, SO I'M

26:07.333 --> 26:09.802
JUST PRAYING THAT MATT OR RAVEN
DON'T WIN THIS DEAL.

26:09.836 --> 26:15.775
>> AND THE NAME INSIDE IS...

26:15.808 --> 26:16.075
JOSH.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.209
>> HOW!

26:17.243 --> 26:20.479
>> SORRY, JOSH, YOU HAVE BEEN
ELIMINATED.

26:20.512 --> 26:21.413
>> THE FREEZER DID NOT WORK.

26:21.447 --> 26:26.953
IT WAS NOT CHILL AT ALL!

26:26.986 --> 26:27.754
BOM-BOM-BOM.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.356
>> THE NEXT CARD WAS FOUND BY
RAVEN.

26:30.389 --> 26:33.926
THE CARD THAT YOU FOUND BELONGS
TO...

26:33.960 --> 26:35.361
>> OH!

26:35.394 --> 26:36.495
>> DARN IT!

26:36.528 --> 26:39.899
I JUST TOOK MATT OUT OF THE
GAME!

26:39.932 --> 26:41.267
DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.870
HOPEFULLY PAUL OR I CAN WIN THIS
VETO.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.604
>> MATT, YOU DIDN'T WIN THE
VETO.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.806
>> NO.

26:46.839 --> 26:50.142
>> RAVEN, YOU ALSO FOUND THE
NEXT CARD, SO LET'S SEE WHO THIS

26:50.176 --> 26:54.480
ONE BELONGS TO.

26:54.513 --> 26:58.918
AND THE THIRD PERSON ELIMINATED
IS...

26:58.951 --> 27:03.455
KEVIN!

27:03.489 --> 27:04.791
>> IT WAS WELL HIDDEN.

27:04.824 --> 27:08.160
>> JASON, RAVEN, AND PAUL ARE
STILL IN THE COMPETITION.

27:08.194 --> 27:12.732
ALL RIGHT, THE NEXT CARD WAS
BROUGHT BACK BY MATT.

27:12.765 --> 27:21.240
MATT, YOU BROUGHT BACK A CARD
THAT BELONGS TO...

27:21.273 --> 27:23.009
SORRY, PAUL,
YOU DID NOT WIN THE VETO.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.510
>> SHOOT!

27:24.543 --> 27:26.713
NOW I JUST TOOK PAUL OUT OF THIS
GAME.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.280
NOW IT'S ALL DOWN TO RAVEN.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.515
SHE HAS TO WIN.

27:29.548 --> 27:41.260
>> THAT MEANS THAT EITHER JASON
OR RAVEN HAS WON THE POWER OF

27:41.293 --> 27:42.161
VETO.

27:42.194 --> 27:47.199
AND THE LAST PERSON ELIMINATED
IS... RAVEN.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.502
THAT MEANS, JASON,
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE WON

27:50.536 --> 27:55.742
THE POWER OF VETO!

27:55.775 --> 27:56.075
.

27:56.108 --> 27:56.909
>> YAY!

27:56.943 --> 27:57.744
>> YEAH!

27:57.777 --> 27:58.978
>> COME ON OVER!

27:59.011 --> 28:01.380
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO RING YOUR
NECK!

28:01.413 --> 28:04.483
>> SO I GOT ANOTHER DATE WITH
THIS SHINY CHARACTER.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.586
THAT MEANS ALL THE POWER IS IN
MY HANS.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.055
>> I THOUGHT YOU GRABBED YOUR
OWN.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.457
>> I THOUGHT I DID, TOO, FOR A
MINUTE.

28:11.490 --> 28:22.735
YOU HAVE SOME DECISIONS TO MAKE,
FELLA.

28:22.769 --> 28:28.707
* *
>> OKAY, GANG!

28:28.741 --> 28:32.511
DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHERE MINE'S
HIDDEN?

28:32.544 --> 28:33.913
>> SHOW US WHERE, PAL.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.782
>> OH, MY GOD, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

28:35.815 --> 28:36.515
>> IT'S RIGHT HERE.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.716
>> I PATTED IT DOWN.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.052
>> I PATTED IT DOWN.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.888
>> THAT'S AWESOME.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.023
>> WELL DONE, SIR.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.293
>> JASON WINS THE VETO, I
BELIEVE HE'LL PULL ME OFF.

28:47.326 --> 28:52.364
SO MATT AND I JUST NEED TO CHILL
OUT, RELAX, SEND KEVIN HOME, AND

28:52.398 --> 28:53.565
LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT H.O.H.

28:53.599 --> 28:54.767
>> OH, MY GOD.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.736
>> I CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH
HERE.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.038
>> WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THAT ROOM.

28:59.071 --> 28:59.806
>> IT IS A JOKE.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.073
>> OH, MY GOD!

29:01.107 --> 29:02.341
THIS IS PERFECT.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.544
NOW WE HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF
NOMINATIONS SO WE CAN TAKE DOWN

29:05.577 --> 29:09.181
RAVEN, PUT KEVIN UP, AND ONCE
KEVIN IS UP THERE, WE CAN FIGURE

29:09.215 --> 29:09.949
OUT WHAT TO DO FROM THERE.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.818
>> OH, MY GOD!

29:11.851 --> 29:13.652
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A BED!

29:13.685 --> 29:15.687
PAUL, YOU DID THIS ROOM, DIDN'T
YOU?

29:15.721 --> 29:16.555
>> NO, I DIDN'T.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.424
>> THEY FLIPPED ALL THE...

29:18.457 --> 29:20.459
>> WELL, I DID SOME OF IT, YET.

29:20.492 --> 29:26.298
>> ANOTHER I WILL ADMIT, I DID
FLIP A BED.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.099
>> WE'RE GOOD.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.034
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.

29:28.067 --> 29:28.567
>> YOU THINK?

29:28.600 --> 29:29.869
>> I'M POSITIVE.

29:29.902 --> 29:30.502
>> OKAY.

29:30.536 --> 29:34.440
>> I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.343
>> THIS IS ABSOLUTE CARNAGE.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.912
>> LOOK, JASON WON THE VETO.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.214
EVERYTHING'S STILL GOING TO
PLAN.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.216
RAVEN, HE'S GOING TO PULL YOU
OFF.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.253
HE'S GOING TO PUT KEVIN THERE
THERE.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.687
BUT I'M JUST ONE VOTE.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.522
I DON'T CONTROL WHAT EVERYBODY
DOES.

29:50.556 --> 29:51.223
>> I HAD FUN.

29:51.257 --> 29:51.790
>> THAT WAS FUN.

29:51.824 --> 29:52.791
>> IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.961
>> OH, MY GOD!

29:54.994 --> 29:57.196
>> SO I'VE GOT THE POWER OF VETO
NOW.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.465
I'VE GOT ALL THE POWER, ALL THE
CONTROL.

29:59.498 --> 30:03.035
AND NOW I'VE GOT A SUPER-BIG
DECISION TO MAKE, WHICH I'M TORN

30:03.069 --> 30:05.938
ABOUT, WHETHER TO ACTUALLY USE
IT, OR LEAVE THE NOMS THE SAME.

30:05.972 --> 30:06.805
I DON'T KNOW.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.841
MY HEAD AND MY STOMACH HURT.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.658
>> YOU CAN'T KEEP IT UP NEAR THE
TOP.

30:26.692 --> 30:27.626
>> YEAH.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.496
>> WE'RE GOING TO PUT MATT OUT,
RIGHT, FIRST?

30:30.529 --> 30:33.866
>> YUP.

30:33.900 --> 30:34.266
>> LISTEN.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.001
>> WHAT?

30:35.034 --> 30:41.107
>> COUNT TO DO SOMETHING NUTS?

30:41.140 --> 30:45.077
SO I'M UNDER THE IMPRESSION BY
ALEX AND PAUL TO TAKE RAVEN DOWN

30:45.111 --> 30:48.780
AND PUT KEVIN UP, SO I JUST WANT
TO RUN THIS PAWN THING BY KEVIN

30:48.814 --> 30:51.717
BECAUSE I HONESTLY WANT TO SEE
WHAT HIS REACTION IS.

30:51.750 --> 30:55.821
IF HE DOES DECIDE THAT'S ALL
RIGHT, THAT MAKES PAUL AND ALEX

30:55.854 --> 30:59.258
HAPPY, AND MATT AND RAVEN WILL
STILL BE BLIND TO THE FACT THAT

30:59.291 --> 31:01.227
WE'RE SENDING MATT HOME, AND
THAT WEEK AWESOME.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.728
>> SAY IT, MAN.

31:02.761 --> 31:08.767
>> IT'S UP TO YOU, BUT I WAS
THINKING, JUST TO-- I WAS

31:08.800 --> 31:12.471
THINKING-- BECAUSE WHEN I
TOLDRAPHYIN, "DON'T WORRY,

31:12.504 --> 31:13.472
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.007
WE'LL WIN THE VETO.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.308
WE'LL PULL RAVEN OFF."

31:16.342 --> 31:17.576
>> WHO YOU GOING TO PUT UP?

31:17.609 --> 31:23.282
>> I WAS THINKING ABOUT PUTTING
YOU UP THERE.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.583
>> ME, WHY?

31:24.616 --> 31:29.288
>> JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING-- I MEAN, JUST SO THEY

31:29.321 --> 31:31.890
CAN'T SAY THAT YOU AIN'T BEEN ON
THE BLOCK, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

31:31.924 --> 31:33.625
>> WHO'S GOING TO SAY THAT?

31:33.659 --> 31:37.329
>> EVERYBODY'S BEEN ON THE BLOCK
THAT IS IN THIS HOUSE EXCEPT

31:37.363 --> 31:37.763
YOU.

31:37.796 --> 31:38.364
>> I KNOW THAT.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.167
IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO GOOD.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.134
I CAN'T WIN NOTHING.

31:42.168 --> 31:45.037
>> IT DOESN'T SEEM LOGICAL.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.738
>> MATT HAS BEEN UP THERE
SEVERAL TIMES.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.407
>> WE'RE SENDING HIM OUT OF
HERE.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.842
>> WE ARE SENDING HIM OUT OF
HERE.

31:50.876 --> 31:51.710
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.313
WE SLEEP NEXT TO EACH OTHER, ME
AND YOU.

31:54.346 --> 31:57.483
YOU ARE GOING TO PUT ME UP?

31:57.516 --> 31:58.717
WOW.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.652
IT SHOCKED ME WHEN HE ASKED ME
IF I WANTED TO GO ON THE BLOCK.

32:00.686 --> 32:03.889
YOU BE, WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER 70
DAYS, SLEEPING TOGETHER ALL THE

32:03.922 --> 32:06.692
TIME, ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IN
THE HOUSE.

32:06.725 --> 32:09.528
MUST BE SOMEBODY ELSE PUTTING A
BUG IN HIS EAR.

32:09.561 --> 32:10.729
TRUST ME, IT'S NOT HIM.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.233
>> THEY THINK I'M GOING TO PULL
RAVEN OFF AND PUT YOU UP.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.302
AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO VOTE
YOU OUT.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.370
>> ARE YOU... WITH ME?

32:18.404 --> 32:19.071
>> NO.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.772
I THINK IT'S KIND OF COOL.

32:20.806 --> 32:21.974
THAT THEY THINK THAT.

32:22.008 --> 32:24.176
>> DON'T PUT ME UP NOW.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.378
... THAT.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.746
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.547
I DON'T CARE.

32:28.580 --> 32:31.750
I CAN JUST LEAVE THE NOMS THE
SAME.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.385
SO KEVIN'S NOT HIP TO THE IDEA.

32:33.419 --> 32:36.955
I'M JUST NOT GOING TO USE KEVIN
AS A PAWN BECAUSE HE'S MY PAL.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.091
HE'S NOT COMFORTABLE, I'M NOT
COMFORTABLE.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.159
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

32:40.192 --> 32:43.695
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BLOWBACK
FROM MATT AND RAVEN.

32:43.729 --> 32:46.132
I HAVEN'T SAID 50 WORDS TO THEM
IN 68 DAYS.

32:46.165 --> 32:50.736
I DON'T WANT TO GO AGAINST PAUL
AND ALEX BECAUSE I'M WITH THEM.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.739
BUT, GOSH DANG IT, I'M NOT DOING
IT.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.475
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO UP.

32:56.508 --> 33:03.449
I THINK I'LL JUST LEAVE THE NOMS
THE SAME.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.318
I THINK IT WOULD BE SMARTEST TO
DUMP MATT.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.954
>> YEAH.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.590
>> YOU ARE PISSING ME OFF RIGHT
NOW, JASON!

33:11.623 --> 33:13.959
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:13.992 --> 33:17.396
LET'S JUST PUT UP KEVIN, AND
THEN THAT WAY WE CAN APPEASE

33:17.429 --> 33:21.233
MATT AND RAVEN ALL WEEK LONG SO
WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN

33:21.267 --> 33:23.702
ATTITUDE PROBLEM, OTHERWISE
THEY'RE GOING TO WIG OUT.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.405
WE CAN VOTE OUT MATT OR WE CAN
VOTE OUT KEVIN.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.339
WE HAVE OPTIONS.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.408
YOU TELL SOMEONE THEY'RE GOING
ON THE BLOCK.

33:29.441 --> 33:35.514
YOU DON'T TELL SOMEONE THEY'RE
NOT GOING ON THE BLOCK.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.482
YOU JUST PUT THEM UP.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.484
>> SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE
IT?

33:38.517 --> 33:41.287
>> THERE'S SOMETHING FISH WEALEX
AND PAUL LOOKING BACK AND FORTH

33:41.320 --> 33:42.454
WITH EACH OTHER.

33:42.488 --> 33:45.057
I'M STARTING TO ACTUALLY GET A
LITTLE PARANOID AND THINKING

33:45.091 --> 33:49.695
THEY WANT ME TO PUT KEVIN UP SO
THAT THEY CAN SWAM THE VOTE AND

33:49.728 --> 33:51.763
SEND HIM HOME.

33:51.797 --> 33:55.467
THAT GUT REACTION TELLS ME THAT
I NEED TO MAKE MY OWN DECISION

33:55.501 --> 33:56.768
RIGHT HERE.

33:56.802 --> 33:57.669
I'M H.O.H.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.804
I GOT BROAD SHOULDERS.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.839
I CAN CARRY IT.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.305
>> THERE WILL BE A SHOW.

34:33.339 --> 34:36.007
>> YES, THERE WILL.

34:36.041 --> 34:39.211
>
>> YES.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.693
>> ME, NEITHER.

34:54.726 --> 35:03.235
>> HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING--
>> I BELIEVE HIM.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.470
>> EXACTLY.

35:04.503 --> 35:08.374
>> SO NOW JASON HAS THE VETO,
AND I'M HOPING THAT HE DOES WHAT

35:08.407 --> 35:11.977
HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO AND
PULLS RAVEN OFF.

35:12.010 --> 35:15.881
OTHERWISE, HE MIGHT FEEL THE
WRATH OF RAVEN, AND I OF ALL

35:15.914 --> 35:25.957
PEOPLE KNOW YOU DO NOT WANT
THAT.

35:25.957 --> 35:37.769
PEOPLE KNOW YOU DO NOT WANT
THAT.

35:37.803 --> 35:42.608
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH JASON, BUT HE'S BEEN

35:42.641 --> 35:44.976
LOOSE-LIPPED WITH KEVIN AND NOW
HE'S GOING ROGUE.

35:45.010 --> 35:48.046
I WAS OKAY WITH MATT OR RAVEN
GOING HOME THIS WEEK BUT THE

35:48.079 --> 35:52.818
FACT THAT KEVIN CONVINCED JASON
NOT TO GO ON THE BLOCK IS

35:52.851 --> 35:54.019
INFURIATING.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.588
HE'S EVEN CAUSING A RIFT BETWEEN
ME AND JASON WHICH I DO NOT

35:56.622 --> 35:56.988
LIKE.

35:57.022 --> 35:58.224
HE HAS TO GO.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.392
>> SO HE'S A NUMBER.

36:00.426 --> 36:00.992
I GET IT.

36:01.026 --> 36:02.561
>> HE'S NOT A GOOD NUMBER.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.830
GET IN HERE, JERK.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.132
>> ARE YOU COMING TO CIZ AND
MAKE UP?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.601
>> NO, DON'T TOUCH ME!

36:09.635 --> 36:10.369
>> COME ON, AL.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.838
>> JASON, I SAW WHAT YOU DID.

36:12.871 --> 36:13.739
YOU CHICKENED OUT.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.073
YOU HAVE TO PUT HIM UP.

36:15.106 --> 36:15.541
>> NO.

36:15.574 --> 36:16.208
>> YES.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.576
>> NO, I'M NOT PUTTING HIM UP.

36:17.609 --> 36:18.377
>> JASON!

36:18.410 --> 36:19.945
>> I'M NOT PUTTING HIM UP.

36:19.978 --> 36:21.213
>> GO AHEAD, YOUR TURN.

36:21.247 --> 36:24.383
>> YOU HAVE YOUR WORD WITH MATT
AND RAVEN RIGHT NOW.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.219
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN TRUST
YOU.

36:27.253 --> 36:32.023
WITH JURY, IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW
THROUGH WITH THIS, YOU LOSE TWO

36:32.057 --> 36:33.158
VOTES.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.626
>> YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT
YOURSELF IF YOU MAKE IT TO THE

36:34.660 --> 36:35.093
END.

36:35.126 --> 36:39.498
THAT'S TWO VOTES.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.300
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ONE
VOTE.

36:41.333 --> 36:42.534
PUT HIM UP.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.370
>> BUT, THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.471
HE'S ONE.

36:45.504 --> 36:49.575
>> TRUE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
HE STIRS UP A LOT OF...

36:49.608 --> 36:51.877
>> HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.713
>> HE'S STIRRING UP STUFF
BETWEEN YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW, AND

36:54.746 --> 36:56.748
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
SINCE DAY ONE.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.950
>> BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE HIM?

36:58.984 --> 37:00.786
>> DO YOU SEE THIS?

37:00.819 --> 37:02.388
DOES EVERYONE SEE THIS?

37:02.421 --> 37:03.922
HE'S TURNING AGAINST ME.

37:03.955 --> 37:04.790
DOES EVERYONE SEE THAT?

37:04.823 --> 37:05.791
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.593
>> I DON'T CARE.

37:07.626 --> 37:11.229
>> IT'S YOUR H.O.H., AND IT'S
YOUR VETO.

37:11.263 --> 37:13.198
YOU CAN REALLY DO WHATEVER...

37:13.231 --> 37:14.366
YOU WANT.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.736
BUT YOU LEAVE THEM BOTH UP
THERE, ONE OF THEM GOES, ONE OF

37:17.769 --> 37:18.537
THEM IS PISSED.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.340
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M THINK ABOUT
IT.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.108
DO THE MOB TACT NICK THIS HOUSE.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.844
SOMEBODY POINTS A FINGER, AND
THEN THEY STIR THE POT, STIR THE

37:25.877 --> 37:28.614
POT, STIR THE POT, AND THEN
ATTACK!

37:28.647 --> 37:30.015
I'M GETTING IN HOT TUB.

37:30.048 --> 37:34.420
ALEX, I GET IT, FOR SOME REASON
YOU REALLY CAN'T STAND KEVIN SO

37:34.453 --> 37:39.658
YOU'RE TRYING TO RAZZ EVERYBODY
ELSE TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.760
>> SO WHAT DO WE DO?

37:41.793 --> 37:48.500
>> WE CAN'T-- WE CAN'T MAKE HIM
DO ANYTHING.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.769
>> HOW CAN I SPELL IT OUT TO
YOU, JASON?

37:50.802 --> 37:52.871
MATT AND RAVEN ARE TWO VOTES IN
JURY.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.039
KEV SIN JUST ONE.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.775
IF YOU SCREW THIS UP, YOU'RE
GOING TO SCREW UP YOUR CHANCES

37:56.808 --> 37:58.310
AT WINNING $500,000!

37:58.344 --> 38:01.112
ARE YOU GOING TO SHOOT YOURSELF
IN THE FOOT.

38:01.146 --> 38:02.548
THINK ABOUT THIS SERIOUSLY.

38:02.581 --> 38:03.749
I AM BEGGING YOU.

38:03.782 --> 38:10.956
>> IF HE DOES PUT KEVIN UP,
SHOULD WE JUST SEND KEVIN HOME?

38:10.989 --> 38:14.660
>> SO IF I DO USE VETO, I'M
GOING TO HAVE KEVIN PISSED AT

38:14.693 --> 38:15.861
ME, WHO IS MY PAL.

38:15.894 --> 38:20.131
IF I DON'T USE IT, I'M GOING TO
HAVE ALEX, PAUL, CHRISTMAS,

38:20.165 --> 38:21.933
MATT, AND RAVEN, PISSED AT ME.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.969
SO IT'S A TERRIBLE SPOT TO BE
IN.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.472
AND I'VE GOT A HUGE DECISION TO

38:51.329 --> 38:54.733
WHERE I'M EITHER GOING TO PISS
MATT AND RAVEN OFF COMPLETELY,

38:54.766 --> 38:56.635
OR PISS KEVIN OFF COMPLETELY.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.737
THOSE ARE MY ONLY TWO OPTIONS.

38:58.770 --> 39:02.808
I JUST HOPE WHAT I'M DOING ISN'T
GOING TO GIVE ME TOO MUCH

39:02.841 --> 39:05.377
BLOW-BACK, BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO
COME OUT OF THIS WEEK WITHOUT A

39:05.411 --> 39:13.819
DIRTY SHIRT.

39:13.852 --> 39:27.733
OKAY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR
THE VETO MEETING.

39:27.766 --> 39:31.102
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

39:31.136 --> 39:34.205
RAVEN AND MATT HAVE BEEN
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION, BUT I

39:34.239 --> 39:36.708
HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE OF
THE NOMINATIONS.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.845
I WANT TO GIVE BOTH OF NOMINEES
A CHANCE TO TELL ME WHY I SHOULD

39:39.878 --> 39:41.880
USE THE VETO TO SAVE YOU.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.649
RAVEN, YOU GO FIRST.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.816
>> ALL RIGHT, JASON.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.152
I TRUST YOU 110%.

39:47.185 --> 39:54.460
AND JUST REMEMBER WHO PUT YOU IN
THE EXTREME-A-TARD.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.627
>> GEEZ!

39:55.661 --> 39:57.696
>> MATT, IT'S YOUR TURN.

39:57.729 --> 40:01.332
>> JASON, I'VE ACTUALLY BECOME
PRETTY AT HOME HERE ON THE

40:01.366 --> 40:04.603
BLOCK, SO I WOULD PREFER THAT
YOU NOT USE THE VETO ON ME.

40:04.636 --> 40:08.373
BUT I DO KNOW A LITTLE GYPSY
THAT I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO USE

40:08.406 --> 40:14.145
THE VETO ON.

40:14.179 --> 40:18.450
>> I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE THESE
ARE TOUGH WATERS TO NAVIGATE

40:18.484 --> 40:20.251
INSIDE THE HOUSE.

40:20.285 --> 40:23.889
AND WHENEVER I HAVE TOUGH
DECISIONS TO MAKE, I ALWAYS FIND

40:23.922 --> 40:26.858
THAT COMING BACK TO MY CORE
BELIEFS AND MY CORE THOUGHTS

40:26.892 --> 40:31.630
WILL WORK THE BEST IN INTENSE
SITUATIONS.

40:31.663 --> 40:39.471
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, I'VE
DECIDED NOT TO USE THE POWER OF

40:39.505 --> 40:48.580
VETO.

40:48.614 --> 40:53.118
BUT I WILL ENTERTAIN A QUESTION
FROM EITHER ONE OF YOU AT THIS

40:53.151 --> 40:54.486
MOMENT IF YOU HAVE.

40:54.520 --> 40:59.257
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR YOU, JASON.

40:59.290 --> 41:07.833
>> I'M GOOD, BUDDY.

41:09.434 --> 41:17.308
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

41:17.342 --> 41:19.344
>> JASON'S PLAYING A DIRTY GAME.

41:19.377 --> 41:26.484
HE KNOWS HOW MUCH THIS GAME
MEANS TO ME.

41:26.518 --> 41:31.890
IF YOU WANT TO CALL YOURSELF A
COWBOY, I-- THAT'S-- THAT'S BULL

41:31.923 --> 41:34.893
BECAUSE A COWBOY DOESN'T GO BACK
ON HIS WORD.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.996
SO HE CAN TAKE HIS WORD IS AND
SHOVE IT.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.965
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

41:39.998 --> 41:42.100
>> JASON, YOU MADE YOUR
DECISION.

41:42.133 --> 41:43.234
YOU KIND OF DUPED US ALL.

41:43.268 --> 41:45.837
YOU HAD US THINKING YOU WERE
GOING TO GO ONE WAY, AND YOU

41:45.871 --> 41:47.606
WENT THE OTHER WAY.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.641
THAT-- THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO PISS
ME OFF.

41:49.675 --> 41:50.742
NO RESPECT THERE.

41:50.776 --> 41:54.345
JUST FEEL LIKE HE'S BEING A
PUNK.

41:54.379 --> 41:57.749
>> JASON!

41:57.783 --> 41:58.817
O.M.G.!

41:58.850 --> 42:00.185
DID YOU LITERALLY JUST DO WHAT I
TOLD YOU NOT TO DO.

42:00.218 --> 42:03.922
NOW MATT AND RAVEN ARE GOING TO
BE MAD AT US.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.924
YOU DUMB RODEO CLONE CLOUN.

42:05.957 --> 42:06.858
JUST LISTEN TO ME NEXT TIME.

42:06.892 --> 42:09.595
>> I I THINK JASON JUST SEALED
HIS FATE.

42:09.628 --> 42:13.464
NOT ONLY DID HE PUT UP MATT AND
RAVEN BUT WENT BACK ON HIS

42:13.498 --> 42:17.368
PROMISE TO PULL RAVEN OFF AND
DREW A LINE IN THE SAND, AND NOW

42:17.402 --> 42:19.905
I'M PRETTY SURE CHAOS IS ABOUT
TO ERUPT.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.807
>> Announcer: WHO WILL BE
EVICTED FROM THE "BIG BROTHER"

42:21.840 --> 42:23.875
HOUSE, MATT OR RAVEN?

42:23.909 --> 42:28.680
PLUS, THE FALLOUT FROM THE VETO
MEETING SENDS THE HOUSE INTO

42:28.714 --> 42:29.915
TURMOIL.

42:29.948 --> 42:36.354
ALL THIS LIVE THURSDAY AT 9:00,
8:00 CENTER ON "BIG BROTHER."
