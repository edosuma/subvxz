You know, I could swear this lot are still alive.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.640
See, that one just winked at me.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.480
We're police officers, Camille.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.000
We should be out catching criminals, not dawdling about,

00:43.040 --> 00:46.320
making polite chit-chat at some random fund-raiser.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.200
You want to save the coral reef, don't you?

00:48.240 --> 00:49.720
Yeah, yeah of course.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.560
Actually no... No, I don't, not if I have to do this.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.440
Yeah, and seeing as this charity's all about

00:52.600 --> 00:55.440
saving sea creatures,

00:55.480 --> 00:57.920
how come they're serving prawns, hmm?

00:57.960 --> 00:59.840
Bit of a mixed message, don't you think?

01:22.600 --> 01:24.280
That'll be him, then.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.480
Well, I'll go and meet him, I'll take him through

01:24.320 --> 01:26.480
to the study.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.240
Yeah, good, good. Very good.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.200
All right, sweetie?

01:34.240 --> 01:37.840
Fine, yeah. It's a bloody good turn-out.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.800
It's all going marvellously.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.360
He's making his way to the study.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.880
Right, good. Well, let's see what he's got to say for

01:53.400 --> 01:57.880
himself, then.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.600
Just give me ten minutes and then come in and

01:57.920 --> 02:01.600
interrupt us, right?

02:01.640 --> 02:05.080
-OK. -Good.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.880
These charity things can be tedious, I know, but

02:05.120 --> 02:08.880
surprisingly useful

02:08.920 --> 02:11.920
when it comes to negotiating our annual budget.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.120
PATTERSON: Most of the police committee are here.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.680
And I'm sure the Inspector would love to meet all of them.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.880
And so he shall.

02:25.880 --> 02:26.920
<i>Merci.</i>

02:31.720 --> 02:33.920
I said stay round the back!

02:33.960 --> 02:35.200
All right!

02:41.640 --> 02:43.200
-Hi. -Hi.

02:43.240 --> 02:46.520
I'm Vicky Woodward. Mr Powell's personal assistant.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.960
-Camille Bordey. -Hi.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.960
God!

03:05.320 --> 03:06.400
Oh!

03:43.560 --> 03:46.480
Everybody move back, please. Move back.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.120
I know who did this.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.840
Jack Roberts.

03:56.880 --> 03:57.960
That's him!

04:14.600 --> 04:17.440
Dwayne, listen to me, there's been a shooting

04:14.600 --> 04:17.440
at the Powells' house.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.200
The suspect has just left in a silver Mercedes car.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.600
I've got a partial registration, 062.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.040
See if you can intercept it.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.040
So?

04:37.080 --> 04:39.920
Well, I can't find any signs of a struggle,

04:39.960 --> 04:42.280
no bruising or lesions on the victim's skin,

04:42.320 --> 04:45.520
and there are no tissues or fibres underneath

04:42.320 --> 04:45.520
his fingernails.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.160
Good, so he was clearly taken by surprise.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.120
-No, sir.

05:09.960 --> 05:13.160
Well, this air conditioning unit is on full blast,

05:09.960 --> 05:13.160
but the window's wide open.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.880
Sometimes people open a window just to get some fresh air.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.040
Hmm.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.600
Or maybe you think that's how the killer got away?

05:24.640 --> 05:28.720
This Jack Roberts, he arranged today's meeting with the

05:24.640 --> 05:28.720
secretary, didn't he?

05:28.760 --> 05:30.640
That's right.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.640
Who in their right mind rings up to make an

05:30.680 --> 05:34.640
appointment to commit murder?

05:34.680 --> 05:38.520
And even if they did, who arranges that meeting in the

05:34.680 --> 05:38.520
middle of a charity fund-raiser

05:38.560 --> 05:42.040
in broad daylight with crowds of people everywhere?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.520
Maybe when he came here, he didn't intend to kill him.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.880
They could have argued.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.840
Right, let's get the paramedics in.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.080
I want everybody out of the house. I want it sealed off.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.360
Only the victim's immediate family can stay, once their

05:53.120 --> 05:56.360
rooms have been checked.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.280
Looks like he was

05:56.400 --> 06:00.280
planning a trip.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.840
CAMILLE: Maybe his secretary knows why.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.600
Bullet.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.360
Hmm.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.600
You're Mr Powell's personal assistant?

06:47.640 --> 06:49.360
Yes, I am.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.640
This must be very distressing for you. Had you been

06:49.400 --> 06:51.640
with him long?

06:51.680 --> 06:53.680
Just a little over seven years.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.080
Three years here, four back in England.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.120
And you arranged the meeting with Mr Powell and Jack Roberts?

07:01.520 --> 07:06.160
Er, well I've only spoken to him on the phone, until today.

07:06.200 --> 07:11.680
Um, I saw him arrive, and I went out to his car and um...

07:11.720 --> 07:14.480
I brought him back in the study to wait for Mr Powell.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.280
What was the nature of their business?

07:16.320 --> 07:19.000
Mr Powell didn't say, sorry.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.560
I do know that he was very uneasy about the meeting, um...

07:23.600 --> 07:26.720
like he didn't want to do it, but didn't have a choice.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.600
He actually asked me to interrupt him after ten minutes.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.760
I didn't get that chance.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.720
If you arranged the meeting, then you must have some

07:31.800 --> 07:34.720
contact details?

07:34.760 --> 07:36.000
I have a phone number.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.880
-Yes.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.040
And um... could you give us a description?

07:40.080 --> 07:42.120
-Here we are. -Thank you.

07:42.160 --> 07:48.200
He was white. Um, 35, 40 maybe, and quite a bit taller than me.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.040
-At least. Yeah.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.760
Brown hair. Brown eyes.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.160
-Quite skinny.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.880
What was he wearing?

07:55.920 --> 07:58.280
A casual jacket. And jeans.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.440
And black shoes.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.800
-Yes. Definitely.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.320
Did anyone else see him?

08:05.360 --> 08:09.960
No. Oh, well...actually, Mark may have done.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.800
-Mark Grainger.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.200
He's one of our divers. He's staying at the house.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.440
He needed some overtime.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.440
He's working double shifts so he was at the marine

08:16.480 --> 08:20.440
reserve last night.

08:20.480 --> 08:24.960
He was making his way upstairs as we went through the hall.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.080
-I don't know.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.200
Um... I don't know who else was in the house.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.360
Er, Duncan Wood, our gardener - he was outside,

08:33.400 --> 08:34.800
so he may have seen him arrive.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.920
OK, thank you.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.040
RICHARD: Oh, there's one more thing.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.680
We found this on Mr Powell's desk.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.920
Yes, I made that booking.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.080
A one

08:49.120 --> 08:51.160
Well, Mr Powell said it was charity business,

08:51.200 --> 08:54.200
so he didn't know, you know, how long he was going to stay.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.760
Thanks.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.680
-That's all for now. -Thank you.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.560
Um, Fidel?

09:10.960 --> 09:13.320
-Sorry, I was just...

09:13.360 --> 09:15.880
Yeah, you'd better get this description circulated

09:15.920 --> 09:17.920
-and check on Dwayne. -Sure.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.520
Straight to the voicemail.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.440
Now there's a surprise. Can I borrow your finger?

09:30.480 --> 09:32.920
Here. Come on.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.160
Yes, thank you.

09:36.200 --> 09:40.680
Right. OK, so the victim was what, five foot ten?

09:36.200 --> 09:40.680
Excuse me, thank you.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.040
And er, shot through the heart.

09:45.080 --> 09:48.080
So, the shot must have been fired...

09:49.200 --> 09:51.040
..from round about...

09:52.360 --> 09:53.840
..here.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.560
Hmm, so the shot wasn't fired through the window.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.000
Now, there are no scuff marks,

10:02.040 --> 10:05.480
no sign of anyone having climbed through in a hurry,

10:05.520 --> 10:08.720
no footprints in the flower bed outside,

10:08.760 --> 10:11.280
so the question remains, why is it open?

10:11.320 --> 10:15.480
I should talk to the other witnesses um, Mark Grainger

10:11.320 --> 10:15.480
and Duncan Wood.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.840
Talk to the wife, too. See if she knew anything

10:15.520 --> 10:18.840
about this Jack Roberts

10:18.880 --> 10:20.360
and what the meeting was about.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.200
And check with the phone company.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.640
See if they can track the number the secretary gave you.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.320
OK.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.600
Well, that's it really. This bloke pulled up in a car,

10:27.360 --> 10:30.600
Vicky met him

10:30.640 --> 10:32.200
and took him inside.

10:32.240 --> 10:35.440
Um, could you describe him?

10:35.480 --> 10:39.520
-He looked a bit like my Uncle George.

10:35.480 --> 10:39.520
-Uh, that doesn't help.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.520
Tall, skinny. Had like a blazer on.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.360
-Pretty much.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.200
Oh, did you hear the gunshot?

10:51.040 --> 10:54.600
I nipped round to take a look at the party, when

10:51.040 --> 10:54.600
Vicky the rottweiler caught me.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.400
I said, keep out the way.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.400
I was heading back round to the pool when I heard the bang.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.440
Then the guy in the silver car just flew past me like a bullet.

11:05.480 --> 11:09.680
-Yeah, it was the same man.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.480
I'm telling you, Fidel, I know these roads like

11:09.720 --> 11:13.480
the back of my hand

11:13.520 --> 11:18.440
and it's nowhere to be seen. He's either dumped the car or

11:13.520 --> 11:18.440
taken the mountain road inland

11:18.480 --> 11:19.800
before doubling back somewhere.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.280
OK, well, start heading back this way.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.280
I've contacted the airport and the marina and I've circulated

11:22.320 --> 11:26.280
his description,

11:26.320 --> 11:28.640
they're all on the look out, he can't get far.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.160
Yeah, that's what they all say. I'll see you in a while.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.360
All right.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.240
Er, didn't pay much attention if I'm honest. People are coming

11:33.400 --> 11:37.240
and going all the time.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.680
But you did see him?

11:38.720 --> 11:41.960
Yeah, from the back. As they walked towards the study.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.920
I said hello to Vicky and she turned round,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.920
but the bloke didn't.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.480
Could you describe him?

11:47.520 --> 11:52.160
Quite tall. Dark hair. Was wearing jeans, I think.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.560
Sorry, don't suppose that's much help.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.320
No, no, don't worry. That's all right. And when

11:55.600 --> 11:59.320
the shot was fired?

11:59.360 --> 12:03.760
I was up in my room. I'd been at the centre checking

11:59.360 --> 12:03.760
on delivery of new equipment.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.760
So I thought I'd get a quick shower and change of shirt

12:03.800 --> 12:06.760
before I joined the party.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.160
I heard the bang, so I went out to the balcony.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.640
You could tell from everyone's reaction it was something bad,

12:13.400 --> 12:17.640
so I just ran downstairs.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.680
Have you ever heard Mr Powell talk about a Jack Roberts?

12:21.720 --> 12:23.720
No. Sorry.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.440
OK, thank you for your help.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.480
Pleasure.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.000
Listen, can I, er, can I be cheeky?

12:32.040 --> 12:34.120
Excuse me?

12:34.160 --> 12:36.200
Can I take you out for a drink

12:36.240 --> 12:38.440
-I know this wicked little beach bar.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.440
-I don't think so.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.600
You've got a boyfriend?

12:39.640 --> 12:40.840
-No. -Then...

12:40.880 --> 12:43.320
But I'm a police officer investigating a murder

12:43.360 --> 12:45.200
and you're a potential witness.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.560
Not the done thing. So it's not a no, then?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.160
It's a what, maybe?

13:10.520 --> 13:12.960
I've never even heard of this man. Who is he?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.440
That's what we're trying to establish.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.080
-I'm sure.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.560
And I... I didn't even know he had a meeting today.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.800
He should have been at the party.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.520
So you have no idea what this meeting might have been about?

13:28.560 --> 13:31.360
No. Doesn't Vicky know?

13:31.400 --> 13:33.720
She, um...

13:33.760 --> 13:36.840
She knows much more about his comings and

13:33.760 --> 13:36.840
goings than I do.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.920
No.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.200
There's nothing else you can tell us?

13:48.560 --> 13:50.080
I can't believe he's gone.

13:53.760 --> 13:57.560
So the wife didn't know what the meeting with Jack

13:53.760 --> 13:57.560
Roberts was about, either?

13:57.600 --> 14:01.640
He's a man, of course he's keeping secrets from

13:57.600 --> 14:01.640
the women in his life.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.480
A bit sexist?

14:03.520 --> 14:05.080
CAMILLE: Um, it's a fact.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.640
All men lead secret lives away from their women.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.680
And those men that don't, wish they did.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.240
Well, I don't have secrets.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.320
I've always regarded myself as being something of an open book.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.440
Really?

14:16.480 --> 14:20.440
Then what's in the metal tin in the top left hand

14:16.480 --> 14:20.440
drawer of your desk?

14:47.360 --> 14:50.160
So, we're running checks on Jack Roberts.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.280
Um... the mobile phone is switched off so they can't

14:50.200 --> 14:54.280
track it

14:54.320 --> 14:58.600
and there's no record of him entering Saint Marie

14:54.320 --> 14:58.600
through immigration.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.080
Well, er, he was very brazen. Perhaps he was a professional.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.520
Yeah, or he could be local, or he came from

15:02.120 --> 15:05.520
one of the other islands

15:05.560 --> 15:08.040
by private boat. I'm checking

15:05.560 --> 15:08.040
with the marina now.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.080
RICHARD: So there are only four people who know

15:08.080 --> 15:11.080
of Jack Roberts.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.880
Let's get our eye witnesses in front of a police artist,

15:13.920 --> 15:15.280
see if we can get a sketch done.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.920
And Fidel, run a full background check on Malcolm Powell,

15:18.960 --> 15:21.080
see if you can find a link with Jack Roberts.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.000
-Background check. -Yes, sir.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.920
On who?

15:29.960 --> 15:31.880
Were you listening to anything I said?

15:31.920 --> 15:34.280
Yes, sir. Of course, it's just, if you,

15:34.320 --> 15:36.040
if you could remind me, that's all.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.640
-Right away, sir.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.880
What?!

16:00.800 --> 16:06.280
Right, so Mr and Mrs Powell's assistant, Vicky Woodward,

16:06.320 --> 16:09.640
meets this man at his car and leads him into the house.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.680
Seen first by the gardener, Duncan Wood.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.880
Then by Mark Grainger just as they're entering the study.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.160
No one else saw Jack Roberts.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.880
Now, Vicky Woodward returns to the party to collect Mr Powell.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.320
On their way back to the house, he instructs her

16:24.360 --> 16:27.080
to interrupt the meeting after ten minutes had passed.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.920
'Give me ten minutes then just come in and interrupt us.'

16:29.960 --> 16:32.080
Miss Woodward then goes back to the party.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.520
But before she can interrupt the meeting as requested,

16:34.560 --> 16:39.000
this man shoots Mr Powell, gets into his car, and escapes.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.200
Letting down our tyre before he goes, so we can't follow him.

16:42.240 --> 16:46.080
Logic would suggest he left via the open window, but there was

16:42.240 --> 16:46.080
no physical evidence of that.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.720
Did we find any fingerprints on the window frame?

16:48.760 --> 16:52.200
Yes, um, but the only clear prints were Mr Powell's

16:48.760 --> 16:52.200
and Miss Woodward's.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.760
Now, I do not believe he escaped through the open window,

16:55.800 --> 16:57.960
I think he went out the way he came in.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.080
Yet no one saw him leave. Why?

17:01.120 --> 17:04.640
Because that area of the house was empty, apart from Mr Powell

17:04.680 --> 17:07.080
and his killer, everyone else was at the party.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.560
Oh! Except Mark Grainger, but he was upstairs.

17:13.120 --> 17:17.040
I saw him myself, upstairs on the balcony

17:13.120 --> 17:17.040
seconds after the gunshot.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.480
What about the gardener?

17:18.520 --> 17:21.000
He was outside as well on the other side of the house,

17:21.040 --> 17:22.920
after talking to Vicky Woodward.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.040
Sir! It's Dwayne. He's found something.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.080
When nothing passed me, I knew he had turned off somewhere,

17:49.120 --> 17:51.560
so I retraced the road back to the Powells' house.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.440
Then a street trader told me he saw a silver car

17:53.640 --> 17:56.440
being driven at speed,

17:56.480 --> 17:58.920
turning off down into the lane back there.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.800
-RICHARD: Well done, Dwayne. -DWAYNE: Thank you, Chief.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.080
RICHARD: This is definitely it.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.680
RICHARD: Do we, er, do we know how far we are from the house?

18:14.720 --> 18:17.040
DWAYNE: Less than half a mile.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.640
It makes sense he'd ditch the car as soon as he could.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.640
He knew we were looking for him. I want a fingertip search of the

18:20.680 --> 18:24.240
area. Let's see if he's dumped the murder weapon.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.600
DWAYNE: Chief.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.320
CAMILLE: Sir!

18:27.360 --> 18:31.960
One set of footprints, and whoever it was,

18:27.360 --> 18:31.960
was dragging something.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.880
A small boat

18:33.920 --> 18:36.560
No, no, no, it'd be way too small. He couldn't get very far

18:33.920 --> 18:36.560
in that.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.920
Right, so he dumps the car, burns it to destroy any evidence

18:42.960 --> 18:46.800
and then, er, takes a small boat out to, what?

18:46.840 --> 18:48.360
RICHARD: A bigger boat anchored in the bay?

18:51.080 --> 18:53.880
Is that why he didn't mind being seen?

18:51.080 --> 18:53.880
He knew he'd be long gone?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.800
This wasn't a spur-of-the-moment killing,

18:57.840 --> 19:00.640
brought on by anger or the result of an argument.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.000
This was a premeditated murder,

19:03.040 --> 19:05.760
meticulously planned down to the last detail.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.280
-CAMILLE: Yep. -DWAYNE: Chief!

19:09.240 --> 19:10.280
Look.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.200
It's those paper things they use to bind up bank notes.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.040
Each one, 2,000 dollars.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.840
And there's ten of them.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.160
20,000 dollars.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.400
RICHARD: How can we can check if there was a bigger boat

19:26.280 --> 19:29.400
in the area?

19:29.440 --> 19:32.960
To get to this part of the island it must have

19:29.440 --> 19:32.960
passed the harbour

19:33.000 --> 19:35.040
and the quayside.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.880
OK, let's check it, if we can get a name of the boat,

19:35.080 --> 19:37.880
we can alert the coastguard.

19:37.920 --> 19:38.920
Done.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.840
OK, sir. I've checked everywhere by the car

19:51.880 --> 19:53.840
and there is no sign of the murder weapon.

19:53.880 --> 19:58.600
No, no, of course not. That'd be far too easy, wouldn't it?

19:58.640 --> 20:02.480
Er, nothing about this case makes any sense.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.280
-Go on. -Right, well the air

20:02.520 --> 20:05.280
conditioning was on full blast,

20:05.320 --> 20:07.120
but the window was wide open.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.560
Secondly, the killer clearly went to the Powell house to

20:07.160 --> 20:10.560
commit murder,

20:10.600 --> 20:13.440
yet made no attempt to conceal his identity.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.920
Just shot the victim through the heart, drove off

20:13.480 --> 20:16.920
in full view of everybody.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.360
And why did he have 20,000 dollars in cash?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.640
Payment

20:22.680 --> 20:26.080
Yeah, paid by whom?

20:26.120 --> 20:30.520
I ran a full number plate of the car. It was stolen.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.960
Something else that doesn't make any sense.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.680
-Criminals steal cars to

20:33.000 --> 20:36.680
give them anonymity.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.520
Our killer was happy to make an appointment in his own name!

20:39.560 --> 20:42.200
You know, why not use his own car

20:42.240 --> 20:44.320
Why go to the trouble of stealing a car

20:44.360 --> 20:47.240
and run the risk of getting caught?

20:47.280 --> 20:50.040
Fidel, where are we up to on the background check

20:47.280 --> 20:50.040
on Malcolm Powell?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.240
What is the matter with you today?

20:54.280 --> 20:56.760
Every time I look at you, you're on that bloody phone!

20:56.800 --> 20:58.920
-I'm sorry, sir. -Come on then,

20:56.800 --> 20:58.920
come on. What is it?

20:58.960 --> 21:04.040
You've got some new app-game-twit-face feature

20:58.960 --> 21:04.040
that does your shopping for you,

21:04.080 --> 21:07.000
while totting up your bank account and telling you the

21:04.080 --> 21:07.000
weather in North Korea?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.320
It's my sergeant's exams.

21:10.360 --> 21:13.680
Good, thank you! It's your sergeant's

21:10.360 --> 21:13.680
exams! Yes, good...

21:13.720 --> 21:15.440
I didn't know that, did I? It's good.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.120
I should be getting my results today. They said they'd call.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.360
But I should be focusing on my work, not on that.

21:20.400 --> 21:24.280
I'm sorry, I won't let it happen again. Unless they ring?

21:24.320 --> 21:26.480
No, of course, thank you.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.760
And er, yeah, I wouldn't worry, Fidel,

21:34.800 --> 21:37.520
I'm sure you've passed with flying colours.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.800
Thank you, sir. The Powell report is on your desk.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.400
Thank you. Good work.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.960
OK, so I checked the harbour office.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.880
They didn't see any boats passing that way. I also spoke

21:46.000 --> 21:49.880
to the fishermen round there.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.480
They have a clear view of the bay from where they sit.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.480
They didn't see anything either.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.120
So he's still on the island?

21:55.160 --> 21:58.560
So burning the car, the tracks to the water,

21:58.600 --> 22:01.040
all an elaborate distraction.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.360
But a distraction from what?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.920
What doesn't he want us to find?

22:05.960 --> 22:09.800
-Another dead end.

22:09.840 --> 22:13.160
I ran a check on the other islands. I've got 17 matches

22:13.200 --> 22:17.680
for the name Jack Roberts. Only eight of those

22:13.200 --> 22:17.680
were in the right age range.

22:17.720 --> 22:22.080
Two are dead, one is in prison and of the remaining five,

22:22.120 --> 22:23.920
four are of Caribbean descent.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.240
What about the other one?

22:25.280 --> 22:26.880
Um, he lives in Antigua.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.720
So? He could have come here by boat.

22:28.760 --> 22:33.240
And he's also five feet four and weighs 23 stone.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.000
Ah.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.480
Right, OK, real name or not,

22:38.520 --> 22:42.720
I want to know who gave Jack Roberts 20,000 dollars.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.000
Why can't we just dust those bands for prints?

22:45.040 --> 22:48.240
No, it's not possible. With porous paper like that,

22:48.280 --> 22:50.680
only the labs in Guadeloupe will have equipment

22:48.280 --> 22:50.680
sensitive enough.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.640
-So, no. -That's where you're

22:50.720 --> 22:54.640
wrong, Fidel. Could someone be so kind as to

22:54.680 --> 22:58.600
buy me a tube of wart cream?

23:21.520 --> 23:22.760
What's that?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.720
There's been an explosion up at the old mine

23:24.760 --> 23:26.800
and you need to get help as fast as you can?

23:29.160 --> 23:30.800
Everyone's a critic, eh?

23:50.440 --> 23:53.280
So, you found your wart cream?

23:53.320 --> 23:55.240
Which, as I'm sure you know,

23:55.280 --> 23:59.160
contains one very useful active ingredient, silver nitrate.

23:59.200 --> 24:03.160
Yeah, of course I knew. OK, go on, how does

23:59.200 --> 24:03.160
this experiment work?

24:03.200 --> 24:07.080
Right. Well, the silver nitrate impregnates the soft paper

24:07.120 --> 24:11.640
and reacts with the sweat in the fingerprints to

24:07.120 --> 24:11.640
form silver chloride.

24:11.680 --> 24:15.280
So I started it last night and now the paper has dried out,

24:11.680 --> 24:15.280
it's er,

24:15.320 --> 24:21.000
well, just a question of exposing the new compound

24:15.320 --> 24:21.000
to ultraviolet light.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.960
If you'd like to hold that, please.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.840
Because under UV light,

24:25.880 --> 24:27.760
silver chloride fluoresces...

24:33.640 --> 24:35.080
..revealing the prints.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.160
Any matches?

24:36.200 --> 24:39.160
Yes, I have, er,

24:39.200 --> 24:42.840
yes, 33 clear prints so far,

24:42.880 --> 24:45.000
all belonging to the same person.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.720
-Malcolm Powell.

24:48.760 --> 24:54.320
Why would Malcolm Powell be giving 20,000 dollars

24:48.760 --> 24:54.320
to his killer?

24:54.360 --> 24:58.440
Well, I did some company searches on his UK businesses

24:54.360 --> 24:58.440
last night,

24:58.480 --> 25:01.160
and it seems that Malcolm Powell isn't quite the man

25:01.200 --> 25:03.320
everyone's been telling us he is.

25:17.480 --> 25:21.000
-Yes. You can talk to me

25:17.480 --> 25:21.000
about Lindman Investments.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.480
It was the main reason the Powells came here.

25:26.520 --> 25:29.600
You know, the economic situation in the UK was awful,

25:29.640 --> 25:32.840
everyone hating any kind of financial institution.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.520
Especially a corrupt one.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.400
The company ran into trouble.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.760
He did what he did to save it.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.640
The press called it a Ponzi scheme, but you know what?

25:41.680 --> 25:43.200
It was a lot more complicated than that.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.560
But he still conned all his investors out of their money.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.520
He paid for his mistakes.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.400
You know, I doubt that escaping prosecution

25:53.440 --> 25:57.320
and moving to the Caribbean was seen by everyone

25:53.440 --> 25:57.320
as justice.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.680
He was truly sorry those people lost their money.

26:00.440 --> 26:01.840
And Jack Roberts?

26:01.880 --> 26:05.920
Oh, well... Jack Roberts started calling a few weeks ago.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.920
He was demanding a meeting.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.200
He was one of the UK investors for Lindman?

26:10.240 --> 26:13.320
Um, yeah. He wouldn't give up.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.120
He was threatening to expose him

26:15.160 --> 26:20.200
and go to the press, and in the end, Mr Powell

26:15.160 --> 26:20.200
agreed to pay him off.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.280
20,000 dollars.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.240
How did you know that?

26:25.760 --> 26:28.640
Never mind, carry on.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.360
Well, Jack Roberts insisted on collecting

26:28.680 --> 26:32.360
the cash face-to-face.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.480
-Uh-huh.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.640
Why didn't you tell us any of this before?

26:37.680 --> 26:42.080
It took Mr and Mrs Powell almost three years to build a new

26:37.680 --> 26:42.080
life for themselves here.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.280
I guess I'm still trying to protect that.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.480
Very well, that'll be all. Thank you.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.760
Thank you.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.120
Oh, no, one more thing. How long have you been in a

26:53.160 --> 26:55.480
relationship with the gardener?

27:00.400 --> 27:01.840
I don't trust her.

27:01.880 --> 27:05.160
What, because she was having an affair with the gardener?

27:05.200 --> 27:06.800
A bit prudish, isn't it?

27:06.840 --> 27:09.240
I thought you French were supposed to be

27:06.840 --> 27:09.240
the great romantics. She's been his personal

27:09.280 --> 27:11.680
assistant for seven years.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.760
She must have known what he was doing in the UK.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.000
I think it's time to talk to the wife.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.080
I knew it would be something like this.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.680
You can't just steal people's money and walk away.

27:26.720 --> 27:30.400
Mrs Powell. We believe that before he died, your husband

27:26.720 --> 27:30.400
tried to buy

27:30.440 --> 27:33.680
Jack Roberts off. D'you know anything about that?

27:34.840 --> 27:37.040
No, of course not!

27:37.080 --> 27:39.520
Were you aware that he had 20,000 in cash?

27:40.920 --> 27:44.880
No, but I wouldn't be.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.200
There was always cash lying around the house.

27:49.280 --> 27:52.560
Malcolm was an old barrow boy. He preferred it,

27:52.600 --> 27:56.120
said it was easier to keep track of.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.760
When did you know his investment company

27:56.160 --> 27:58.760
was a scam?

28:01.480 --> 28:04.360
The same time as everybody else.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.840
I was horrified and not just because of what he'd done,

28:07.880 --> 28:09.360
but because he'd kept it from me.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.560
It was a tough time for us.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.920
Our marriage only survived

28:15.960 --> 28:18.280
because he agreed to come out here three years ago and...

28:20.280 --> 28:22.080
I know what you must think.

28:22.120 --> 28:26.600
But my husband was a good man, he was a kind man.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.920
And the charity was testament to that.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.120
He just...

28:32.640 --> 28:35.680
He just took a wrong turn and...and couldn't find

28:32.640 --> 28:35.680
his way back.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.240
Good morning, sir.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.600
Oh, I got the interim report back from the pathologist.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.480
All right, so Malcolm Powell was killed by a 9mm bullet

28:47.520 --> 28:50.280
that pierced his heart, it was the right ventricle,

28:50.320 --> 28:52.520
and the striations to the flesh around the wound suggest

28:52.560 --> 28:55.480
that the gun was held directly at his body when it was fired.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.400
Sounds like an execution to me.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.800
Right. And I also contacted the Serious Organised Crime Agency

29:00.840 --> 29:03.040
back in the UK about Lindman Investments.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.520
Now, they seem to think that up to 18 million pounds

29:05.560 --> 29:08.080
was taken from investors before the company collapsed

29:08.120 --> 29:10.360
and not all of it was found either.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.080
They think Malcolm Powell had it?

29:12.120 --> 29:14.480
Well, if he did, they didn't find anything.

29:15.760 --> 29:19.040
So, who was our victim, hmm?

29:19.080 --> 29:22.920
An inept businessman who simply took a wrong turn?

29:22.960 --> 29:26.360
Here in Saint Marie to rebuild his life,

29:26.400 --> 29:29.320
make amends with his charity work?

29:29.360 --> 29:31.400
-Hmm, a crook.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.880
Well, you know what they say, a leopard never changes

29:31.440 --> 29:34.880
its spots.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.600
Yeah, Fidel, I want you to go to the bank.

29:37.640 --> 29:41.600
Check all the accounts held there in either Powell's

29:37.640 --> 29:41.600
or his wife's name.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.240
In particular,

29:43.280 --> 29:46.760
I want you to look at the statements for

29:43.280 --> 29:46.760
the Marine Reserve.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.120
If you would, follow the money!

29:49.160 --> 29:50.400
Yes, sir!

29:50.440 --> 29:51.840
-Camille. -Yes.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.960
See if you can get the police reports.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.960
Get a list of all the people who lost money

29:54.000 --> 29:57.960
in Lindman Investments.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.040
OK.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.320
I've just spoken to Lucille.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.760
She's a systems coordinator on the fifth floor of

30:04.360 --> 30:07.760
Government House.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.520
We had a little thing going on last year, nothing serious,

30:10.560 --> 30:12.960
just a bit of summer loving and some windsurfing...

30:13.000 --> 30:16.240
Yes, all right, Dwayne, thank you. Spare us the

30:13.000 --> 30:16.240
gory details, if you would.

30:16.280 --> 30:20.000
Yes, of course, sir. Anyway, the fifth floor is

30:16.280 --> 30:20.000
where the exam board is,

30:20.040 --> 30:23.000
and I asked her to check on the sergeant's exam results.

30:23.040 --> 30:27.120
Dwayne! That is completely unethical.

30:27.160 --> 30:30.040
-That they were

30:27.160 --> 30:30.040
posted out this morning.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.920
-And the post office is

30:30.080 --> 30:32.920
closed for the weekend.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.560
Did she say whether he'd passed?

30:34.600 --> 30:38.280
She hasn't got a clue. And neither will he

30:34.600 --> 30:38.280
until Monday now.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.560
I checked the list of investors for Lindman UK

30:48.600 --> 30:52.080
and I've found a Jack Roberts.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.480
He lost everything he had.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.840
Ah! At last. Something that makes sense.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.680
No, not exactly.

30:57.720 --> 31:01.120
He disappeared. Three years ago, a boating accident,

31:01.160 --> 31:03.240
he fell from his yacht in La Manche.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.000
Oh, right, the English Channel.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.920
-La Manche. -Yeah, it's what I said.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.920
The English Channel.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.480
Why is it English?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.280
I don't know really, but it's called

31:09.520 --> 31:11.280
the English Channel.

31:11.320 --> 31:15.200
-No. Still listed as missing,

31:11.320 --> 31:15.200
presumed dead.

31:17.360 --> 31:20.640
I've got it! You were right to make me follow the money.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.520
-Well, firstly, it seems

31:20.680 --> 31:23.520
Mr Powell took out

31:23.560 --> 31:26.600
cash from his personal account regularly, 2,000 at a time.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.440
His wife said he liked to carry cash.

31:28.480 --> 31:31.200
-Yes, but then I checked the marine reserve account.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.520
All cleared out, two days ago.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.440
Up to three million dollars was wired

31:33.560 --> 31:35.440
into a bank account

31:35.480 --> 31:37.400
in the Cayman Islands. Look.

31:37.440 --> 31:40.160
Which explains the plane ticket we found. He was

31:37.440 --> 31:40.160
going to leave the country.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.680
Once a crook, always a crook!

31:41.720 --> 31:44.960
-Exactly. -Hold on.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.960
This doesn't make any sense.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.560
We've been assuming Jack Roberts killed Malcolm Powell because of

31:45.000 --> 31:48.560
money he lost three years ago.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.440
And now we discover that Jack Roberts is dead.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.840
-Yes.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.840
According to this, we have five witnesses who saw him

31:53.880 --> 31:56.320
swept overboard into the English Channel.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.440
-La Manche. -Just ignore it.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.040
Two others dived in to try and rescue him.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.960
So if Jack Roberts is not our killer,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.760
what if it's someone using his name to avenge him?

32:06.800 --> 32:09.640
But why make an appointment to do it for the middle

32:06.800 --> 32:09.640
of a charity party? In broad daylight,

32:09.680 --> 32:12.520
surrounded by so many people?

32:12.560 --> 32:14.040
Someone who wants to be caught?

32:15.120 --> 32:16.200
Ah!

32:18.840 --> 32:22.600
That is the paradox right at the heart of the case, isn't it?

32:22.640 --> 32:26.040
The only logical reason to kill someone during

32:22.640 --> 32:26.040
a daylight party

32:26.080 --> 32:29.800
is because you want to be seen and yet, no one saw

32:26.080 --> 32:29.800
him commit the murder.

32:32.960 --> 32:38.600
Maybe that's it. The identity of the killer seemed so obvious,

32:32.960 --> 32:38.600
we just accepted it,

32:38.640 --> 32:40.480
we didn't question it.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.720
Right, when you hit a dead end, throw out

32:40.520 --> 32:42.720
everything you think you know

32:42.760 --> 32:47.760
and start again. So, if we dismiss Jack Roberts as a

32:42.760 --> 32:47.760
possible suspect for the moment,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.640
who else could have killed Malcolm Powell?

32:49.680 --> 32:54.640
At the precise moment the shot was fired, where was everyone?

32:54.680 --> 32:57.640
The gardener, Duncan Wood, he was in plain view.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.640
Could he be the killer?

32:57.680 --> 33:00.560
-Absolutely not. -RICHARD: The same goes

32:57.680 --> 33:00.560
for Vicky Woodward.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.600
Right, Mark Grainger appeared on the balcony above the study,

33:05.640 --> 33:09.680
seconds after the gunshot, so he couldn't have

33:05.640 --> 33:09.680
done it, either.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.080
Statements indicate Mrs Powell wasn't actually seen

33:12.120 --> 33:13.840
when the shot was fired.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.280
We only saw her when we arrived at the house.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.840
I think she genuinely loved him. She would be the

33:16.320 --> 33:19.840
last on my list.

33:19.880 --> 33:23.680
In a case of paradoxes, maybe that makes her the most likely.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.440
No, no, no, no, no, no, there's something else, isn't there?

33:26.480 --> 33:29.880
There's the other things. There's the... I mean, why

33:26.480 --> 33:29.880
was the window left open?

33:29.920 --> 33:31.120
And the drawer.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.840
And who made the appointment and drove the car if Jack Roberts

33:34.600 --> 33:37.840
had been dead three years?

33:37.880 --> 33:39.200
It's not possible.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.560
FIDEL: You're right sir, it's not possible.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.040
FIDEL: If Jack Roberts isn't our killer...

33:46.080 --> 33:48.000
Because he's been dead three years.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.240
-..And you're also saying that Mrs Powell can't be either.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.240
-I don't think so.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.920
..Then no-one's our killer. Because when Malcolm

33:50.280 --> 33:53.920
Powell died,

33:53.960 --> 33:55.880
everyone was in the garden, weren't they?

33:55.920 --> 33:58.200
It's not possible to be in two places at the same time.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.920
What?

33:59.960 --> 34:02.640
-I said it's not possible... -No, I heard you.

33:59.960 --> 34:02.640
That's brilliant.

34:04.280 --> 34:08.520
You can't be in two places at the same time!

34:08.560 --> 34:11.400
Except, of course you can.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.800
In fact, that's the only thing that makes any sense!

34:31.000 --> 34:33.720
Right, you say the victim regularly took out

34:33.760 --> 34:36.280
bundles of cash in 2,000 dollar chunks.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.560
-Yes, sir.

34:44.360 --> 34:47.200
-It is. We allowed

34:44.360 --> 34:47.200
Mrs Powell to stay,

34:47.240 --> 34:49.720
but the murder scene's been preserved.

34:49.760 --> 34:54.640
OK, get everyone to the house. First I need a search warrant.

34:54.680 --> 34:55.720
Yes, sir.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.880
RICHARD: I want to search the bedroom above the study.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.640
The murder weapon is not here.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.000
The house was sealed off. It has to be here.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.320
Wait.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.920
CAMILLE: Someone has moved the carpet.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.360
Sorry to have kept you all waiting.

35:25.400 --> 35:31.840
It's just this case has been a particularly

35:25.400 --> 35:31.840
difficult nut to crack.

35:31.880 --> 35:36.120
It's true that we had eye witnesses placing the killer

35:31.880 --> 35:36.120
at the scene.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.960
Identified as Jack Roberts.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.560
And we later discovered that Jack Roberts was an investor,

35:42.600 --> 35:46.680
who was cheated out of his money by Mr Powell's UK company,

35:46.720 --> 35:48.840
Lindman Investments.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.040
Which gave us a motive.

35:51.080 --> 35:55.240
So we had a killer and a motive. Excellent start.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.880
Until we discovered that Jack Roberts had been missing,

35:57.920 --> 36:00.840
presumed dead for over three years.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.080
Around the time you came here from England, was it not?

36:05.880 --> 36:06.920
Yes.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.040
So was Jack Roberts our killer or not?

36:12.080 --> 36:15.000
Was he dead or alive?

36:15.040 --> 36:18.520
To be honest, I didn't hold out much hope we'd ever find him.

36:18.560 --> 36:21.440
But in fact, he's in this very room.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.040
Or at least the real killer is.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.640
The one who used the name of Jack Roberts

36:26.680 --> 36:30.000
to create something of an elaborate illusion.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.800
You see, this was to be the perfect murder.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.440
Predicated on the fact that Mr Powell

36:34.480 --> 36:38.160
had a reputation for being less than honest with

36:34.480 --> 36:38.160
other people's money.

36:38.200 --> 36:41.360
Just tell me who killed my husband?

36:41.400 --> 36:43.680
Well, it's obvious, when you think about it.

36:43.720 --> 36:47.920
There's only one person here with the organisational skills

36:47.960 --> 36:51.200
necessary to pull off such a meticulously-planned murder.

36:51.240 --> 36:55.280
It was you, Vicky, the secretary.

36:51.240 --> 36:55.280
You killed Malcolm Powell.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.480
What!? RICHARD: Just as it was you

36:57.520 --> 36:59.280
who emptied the charity's bank accounts.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.880
And bought the plane ticket in his name

37:01.920 --> 37:03.920
to make it look like he was about to

37:01.920 --> 37:03.920
skip the country.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.800
I'm sorry, you saw me! I was in the garden

37:06.840 --> 37:09.680
when he was killed!

37:09.720 --> 37:12.600
Ah, yes, you were, weren't you?

37:12.640 --> 37:16.280
And you can't be in two places at the same time, can you?

37:16.320 --> 37:20.520
Therefore, logically, seeing as you're the killer...

37:20.560 --> 37:24.040
Mr Powell must have been killed at a different time.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.920
RICHARD: A fact that I was able to prove

37:24.080 --> 37:27.920
about ten minutes ago

37:27.960 --> 37:31.520
when I found the murder weapon. in the bedroom above the study.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.160
The house was sealed off, it has to be here.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.320
Perhaps you can tell me

37:38.360 --> 37:41.960
why did everyone hear the shot that killed Mr Powell

37:42.000 --> 37:47.200
when the gun that was used to fire it was fitted

37:42.000 --> 37:47.200
with a silencer?

37:47.240 --> 37:49.840
There were two shots fired that day, weren't there?

37:49.880 --> 37:53.600
One with the silencer and one without.

37:53.640 --> 37:54.920
Two shots?

37:54.960 --> 37:57.720
So, you're saying she had what, an accomplice?

37:57.760 --> 38:00.880
No, Mark. I'm saying she had two.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.680
As you well know because you were one of them.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.880
That can't be true.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.840
And you were the other. Weren't you, Duncan?

38:06.880 --> 38:10.200
Because this wasn't one person masquerading as Jack Roberts,

38:10.240 --> 38:12.160
it was three!

38:12.200 --> 38:14.880
You see this was a plan hatched between lovers.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.400
RICHARD: The all-knowing, ever present

38:18.440 --> 38:22.520
trusted personal assistant and her gardener boyfriend.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.760
I'm not really sure at what point they enlisted you, Mark.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.840
Perhaps they knew you were in financial difficulties.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.440
Er, Mark Grainger, he's working double shifts.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.280
How do you know all this?

38:34.320 --> 38:36.200
Well, it's simple, really.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.240
If the real Jack Roberts died three years ago,

38:36.240 --> 38:39.240
as he almost certainly did,

38:39.280 --> 38:41.800
then the three people who claim to have seen him

38:41.840 --> 38:47.280
and who all gave an identical description of him,

38:41.840 --> 38:47.280
must be in cahoots.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.400
This wasn't about revenge,

38:49.440 --> 38:51.760
this was about stealing three million dollars.

38:51.800 --> 38:54.640
RICHARD: Miss Woodward would have known about Jack Roberts,

38:54.680 --> 38:57.200
the fact his body was never found.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.840
How dramatic, a man who lost everything,

39:00.880 --> 39:04.040
returned from the dead to wreak his terrible revenge.

39:04.080 --> 39:09.720
The perfect stooge, to provide each of you

39:04.080 --> 39:09.720
with the perfect alibi.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.840
RICHARD NARRATING:<i> It began</i> <i>with Mark driving the car</i>

39:09.760 --> 39:12.840
<i>to the house.</i>

39:12.880 --> 39:16.800
<i>We all saw the car arrive but</i> <i>couldn't see who was driving.</i>

39:18.920 --> 39:21.800
Well, I'll go and meet him. I'll show him into the study?

39:21.840 --> 39:24.200
To be met by Vicky, as arranged.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.160
RICHARD NARRATING:<i> But rather</i> <i>than show him into the study,</i>

39:28.200 --> 39:30.840
<i>she let him make</i> <i>his way upstairs.</i>

39:30.880 --> 39:35.040
<i>She then went to get her</i> <i>employer bringing him back</i>

39:30.880 --> 39:35.040
<i>to the house.</i>

39:35.080 --> 39:40.160
<i>Once in the study, she went to</i> <i>her desk, opened the drawer,</i>

39:40.200 --> 39:43.560
<i>took out her gun and</i> <i>shot Malcolm Powell</i>

39:40.200 --> 39:43.560
<i>through the heart.</i>

39:47.040 --> 39:49.760
No one heard anything because she used a silencer.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.760
She then moved to the window and opened it.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.880
<i>Mark lowered a</i> <i>bag from upstairs.</i>

39:55.920 --> 40:00.360
<i>Vicky retrieved the car keys</i> <i>from it then sent him</i>

39:55.920 --> 40:00.360
<i>the gun in return.</i>

40:05.240 --> 40:07.440
<i>She then left the house,</i>

40:07.480 --> 40:10.720
<i>stopping only to give her lover</i> <i>Duncan the car keys.</i>

40:12.320 --> 40:16.480
By the time you exchanged pleasantries with

40:12.320 --> 40:16.480
Sergeant Bordey

40:16.520 --> 40:17.880
Mr Powell was already dead.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.200
And it was time for the next part of your plan.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.160
<i>Once he'd removed the silencer</i> <i>and fired the gun again,</i>

40:27.200 --> 40:29.920
<i>the plan was to make sure</i> <i>he was seen on the balcony</i>

40:27.200 --> 40:29.920
<i>within seconds of the gun shot.</i>

40:29.960 --> 40:34.640
Thereby giving both himself and Miss Woodward

40:29.960 --> 40:34.640
the perfect alibi.

40:34.680 --> 40:38.000
First of course, you had to hide the gun

40:34.680 --> 40:38.000
and the silencer.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.560
The house was sealed off, but no doubt

40:38.040 --> 40:40.560
you intended to come back

40:40.600 --> 40:44.080
and retrieve it, once we were off on a wild goose chase.

40:44.120 --> 40:47.200
Which was your next job, wasn't it?

40:47.240 --> 40:51.720
<i>You made sure we</i> <i>couldn't give chase and</i>

40:47.240 --> 40:51.720
<i>then made off in the Mercedes.</i>

40:54.320 --> 40:58.440
<i>All that was left to do</i> <i>was to leave a false trail</i>

40:54.320 --> 40:58.440
<i>for us to follow.</i>

40:58.480 --> 41:03.240
We were supposed to think that Mr Powell had tried to buy

40:58.480 --> 41:03.240
Jack Roberts off

41:03.280 --> 41:06.320
before he then escaped the island on a boat.

41:06.360 --> 41:09.240
<i>You dumped and burnt the car.</i>

41:09.280 --> 41:13.000
<i>You even left behind</i> <i>some cash wraps</i>

41:09.280 --> 41:13.000
<i>as the final piece of evidence,</i>

41:13.040 --> 41:17.240
<i>no doubt collected by</i> <i>Miss Woodward over</i>

41:13.040 --> 41:17.240
<i>the preceding months.</i>

41:20.680 --> 41:23.840
Duncan then made his way around the headland

41:23.880 --> 41:25.640
as if he'd never been gone.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.400
And you were left with three cast-iron alibis

41:28.440 --> 41:32.440
and three million in cash, just waiting to be picked up.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.960
After all, none of you could have been near the study

41:36.000 --> 41:37.720
when the shot was fired.

41:37.760 --> 41:42.520
And if that wasn't enough, we'd all seen the killer

41:37.760 --> 41:42.520
arrive together,

41:42.560 --> 41:46.760
heard the shot together, and watched him drive away together.

41:48.720 --> 41:49.800
The perfect murder.

41:52.960 --> 41:56.040
For which all three of you will spend the rest

41:52.960 --> 41:56.040
of your lives in prison.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.120
Lock them up.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.680
Well, we've had some excitement here today, you know.

42:25.720 --> 42:27.120
Oh, what?

42:27.160 --> 42:29.920
-Someone broke into the Post Office.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.920
-CAMILLE: No!

42:29.960 --> 42:31.880
A window was forced open.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.800
-Must have been kids. -I guess.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.000
Although talking about post,

42:37.040 --> 42:39.800
this arrived for you earlier, Fidel, I forgot to mention it.

42:39.840 --> 42:43.040
-Earlier. Before now.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.920
The Post Office was already closed

42:44.960 --> 42:46.800
when you found out this had been posted.

42:46.840 --> 42:49.920
Chief, will you take off your detective head? You're amongst

42:46.840 --> 42:49.920
friends now.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.040
If I find out you broke into that Post Office...

42:52.080 --> 42:54.960
Don't worry. You won't find out.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.800
Look, can I have it or not?

42:57.840 --> 43:00.600
I suppose so, although strictly speaking this makes us

42:57.840 --> 43:00.600
all accessories.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.840
I'll risk it.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.200
I passed!

43:18.840 --> 43:20.520
Come here.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.760
-Bravo, Fidel! -Thank you, sir.

43:22.800 --> 43:23.840
Yes, aye!

43:27.400 --> 43:31.280
Please, carry on. You've done a great job.

43:31.320 --> 43:35.600
And I hear congratulations are in order, Sergeant Best.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.680
Yes, sir, thank you.

43:37.720 --> 43:40.000
I just need to give Juliet a call.

43:40.040 --> 43:42.120
Can I buy you a drink, Commissioner?

43:42.160 --> 43:44.720
A small rum perhaps, just to mark the occasion.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.600
Coming right up.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.200
Could we have a word, please?

43:51.400 --> 43:53.240
If it's about the Post Office,

43:53.280 --> 43:56.280
I have five eye witnesses who saw me on the other side

43:53.280 --> 43:56.280
of the island, OK?

43:58.240 --> 43:59.760
Sir.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.200
DWAYNE: Commissioner. Chief.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.400
Congratulations.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.000
You have quite a team.

44:08.040 --> 44:10.000
Yes, yes, I do.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.720
I've just had a conversation with

44:12.760 --> 44:16.920
an Inspector Darwin of the Serious Organised

44:12.760 --> 44:16.920
Crime Agency in London.

44:16.960 --> 44:20.320
-He headed up the investigation

44:16.960 --> 44:20.320
of Malcolm Powell

44:20.360 --> 44:22.600
and Lindman Investments UK.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.160
I see. Yeah.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.880
A substantial amount of the money invested

44:24.200 --> 44:26.880
in the company

44:26.920 --> 44:28.160
was never recovered.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.760
So I understand.

44:29.800 --> 44:34.280
He seemed to think the fact we've just charged

44:29.800 --> 44:34.280
Powell's assistant

44:34.320 --> 44:37.400
with his murder might prove useful.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.120
They want to question her. So when are they coming?

44:40.880 --> 44:44.160
-They want to interview her in London.

44:40.880 --> 44:44.160
-Ah, right.

44:44.200 --> 44:49.160
They want her escorted by a senior officer. I suggested you.

44:49.200 --> 44:53.040
-It makes sense. You know

44:49.200 --> 44:53.040
the details of the case.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.600
So, I'd have to go back to London?

44:55.640 --> 44:57.080
Just for a few days.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.960
Your flight leaves at six o'clock,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.520
I'll have a cab pick you up at your house in an hour.

45:01.560 --> 45:04.320
I'll have the prisoner taken directly to the airport,

45:04.360 --> 45:05.880
you can pick her up from there.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.040
An hour. Crikey.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.960
I suggest you go home and pack.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.240
I think he just said I'm going back to London for a few days.

45:34.560 --> 45:38.400
Oh, I tell you it's a job to know what to pack.

45:38.440 --> 45:42.720
It will be winter over there, you know. I checked the weather.

45:42.760 --> 45:45.720
Overcast. Four degrees.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.800
Ha, ha! It's not even that cold in my fridge.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.880
But you will be back on Friday?

45:51.920 --> 45:56.080
Yeah, that's the plan. Of course things might change.

45:51.920 --> 45:56.080
You know, not saying they will,

45:56.120 --> 45:59.040
but, you know being here wasn't really the plan, was it?

45:59.080 --> 46:01.880
Not exactly. It just sort of happened.

46:01.920 --> 46:05.480
One minute I was in Croydon and the next...

46:07.240 --> 46:11.280
I mean, not that I haven't loved it, you know, I have.

46:11.320 --> 46:15.600
And you and... Well, all of you! You know, the gang.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.800
Yeah. Loved every minute of it.

46:19.720 --> 46:22.400
Well, maybe not every minute, you know, in the main.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.080
Anyway, it's only till Friday.

46:24.120 --> 46:27.160
-Oh, actually I will need someone to look after Harry.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.080
Yeah, my lizard.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.320
I had to give him a name. I couldn't just keep

46:29.120 --> 46:32.320
calling him lizard.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.120
Only you could call a lizard Harry.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.320
Ah! Beer!

46:39.000 --> 46:40.440
Just what I need.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.520
You won't come back, will you?

46:49.240 --> 46:51.920
-Yeah, of course I will. -No, you won't.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.480
You'll get home, it will be cold and raining

46:54.520 --> 46:57.920
and you'll have a pint of beer in your pub

46:57.960 --> 46:59.560
and you'll want to stay there.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.280
All packed, Chief?

47:03.640 --> 47:07.200
Yes, well. I mean, not really much to, erm...

47:07.240 --> 47:08.960
You know, it's only a few days.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.640
It won't be the same without you, Sir.

47:13.160 --> 47:16.120
Oh, gosh, there's my car.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.200
Yeah, coming!

47:21.000 --> 47:22.480
I'd better take that, Chief.

47:29.720 --> 47:30.800
Hold on.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.160
Right, well...

47:42.200 --> 47:45.160
-So, we'll see you on Friday then, Sir.

47:42.200 --> 47:45.160
-Yep. Absolutely.

47:54.160 --> 47:55.680
Safe flight, Chief.

48:10.520 --> 48:11.720
Back before you know it.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.800
I'm telling you, he's not coming back.

49:08.840 --> 49:10.680
By the time he gets that cold in his bones

49:10.720 --> 49:13.880
and that rain in his face, he'll think he's died and

49:10.720 --> 49:13.880
gone to heaven.

49:13.920 --> 49:16.800
No, Dwayne. He'll be back. Won't he, Camille?

49:16.840 --> 49:18.320
He said he would.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.880
Of course he did and I'm sure he meant it when he said it.

49:20.920 --> 49:23.560
-But it'll all be different when he's home.

49:20.920 --> 49:23.560
-Yeah, maybe.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.280
Well, he'll be somewhere tonight, with a huge plate

49:23.600 --> 49:26.280
of fish and chips,

49:26.320 --> 49:29.280
-a mug of tea and a crossword. -A toast!

49:29.320 --> 49:32.080
To the most annoying, childish,

49:32.120 --> 49:36.000
pedantic, funny,

49:36.040 --> 49:38.000
brilliant man I've ever met.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.760
Inspector Richard Poole.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.080
Richard Poole!

49:54.600 --> 49:55.920
Oh, you look nice.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.000
What, this?

49:58.040 --> 50:00.680
It was the first thing I saw when I opened the wardrobe.

50:00.720 --> 50:04.520
Oh really? I just thought with it being Friday...

50:04.560 --> 50:05.640
Is it?

50:05.680 --> 50:08.880
Mm. Which means Richard will be back.

50:08.920 --> 50:12.120
Well, I suppose it does, I'd forgotten all about it.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.000
So you don't want to do anything special then?

50:20.040 --> 50:21.320
What time is it?

50:22.280 --> 50:23.600
Quarter to six.

50:23.640 --> 50:27.080
So land at half past four, get cases by what five?

50:27.120 --> 50:28.640
More or less.

50:28.680 --> 50:31.240
Get to the car. Friday evening traffic, should be here by...

50:31.280 --> 50:32.320
Quarter to six?

50:33.800 --> 50:35.840
He'll be here, don't worry.

50:35.880 --> 50:37.280
The suspense is killing me.

50:38.760 --> 50:41.000
-The Commissioner's car.

50:48.680 --> 50:49.760
Good evening, team.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.080
He was on the flight, right?

50:56.120 --> 50:58.960
Ah. Bit of a problem on that front.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.520
RICHARD: Too right, there's a problem.

51:05.560 --> 51:07.960
They lost my luggage. Again!

51:08.000 --> 51:10.880
That's two flights I've made to this benighted island

51:10.920 --> 51:12.440
and both times they've lost my luggage!

51:12.480 --> 51:15.920
It's like they've got some kind of twisted vendetta against me.

51:15.960 --> 51:18.440
What is the point of having a luggage carousel

51:18.480 --> 51:20.560
if there's never anything on it! Hmm?

51:20.600 --> 51:23.240
I mean they call it paradise, but they've got a very funny

51:20.600 --> 51:23.240
idea of what paradise is,

51:23.280 --> 51:28.200
if it includes walking around in a hundred degree heat in the

51:23.280 --> 51:28.200
same pants for a fortnight!

51:28.240 --> 51:30.280
Welcome home, Chief.
