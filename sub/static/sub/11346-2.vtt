(announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.408 --> 00:10.778
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.313
IN NEW YORK CITY,

00:12.346 --> 00:13.481
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.514 --> 00:15.416
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.449 --> 00:16.750
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:16.784 --> 00:19.120
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.521
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.156 --> 00:26.627
[applause,
marching band playing]

00:31.599 --> 00:34.602
- 20 YEARS AS COACH
AT ST. VALERIE HIGH.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.137
NINE CITY TITLES.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.671
FOUR STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.408
RUNS THE BARONS TOO,
HIS SUMMER LEAGUE TEAM.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.310
HE'S PUT HUNDREDS
OF PLAYERS IN COLLEGE

00:42.343 --> 00:44.078
AND A DOZEN IN THE PROS.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.246
LOOK AT THESE FAT CATS.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.380
[laughter]

00:46.414 --> 00:48.149
HE'S MADE
MORE MILLIONAIRES

00:48.182 --> 00:49.150
THAN HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.851
[laughter]

00:50.884 --> 00:52.386
- PRINCE MILLER,
HIS BIGGEST STAR,

00:52.420 --> 00:53.821
COULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT.

00:53.854 --> 00:57.125
BUT HE SENT COACH
THIS SOLID GOLD KEY.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.826
FITS ANY GYM
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.194
- OHH, THANK YOU.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.130
[applause]

01:07.568 --> 01:10.138
- BUT MORE IMPORTANT
THAN MOLDING PLAYERS,

01:10.171 --> 01:11.772
COACH HAS MOLDED
YOUNG LIVES.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.374
I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SAY

01:13.407 --> 01:14.542
I WAS A STRAY DOG

01:14.575 --> 01:15.676
AND YOU RESCUED ME.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.778
- IT'S OUR PRIVILEGE
TO INTRODUCE

01:17.811 --> 01:19.547
THE NEWEST INDUCTEE

01:19.580 --> 01:21.782
TO THE METRO BASKETBALL
HALL OF FAME.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.152
IT'S COACH RAY, BABY.
- RAY MASTERS.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.519
[applause]

01:25.553 --> 01:27.721
- THANK YOU, COACH.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.895
MELO, CHRIS.
ALL MY FRIENDS.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.364
HOW DO I BEGIN
TO THANK YOU?

01:36.397 --> 01:37.631
- HALL OF FAME, MY ASS.

01:37.665 --> 01:40.768
BOO!

01:40.801 --> 01:43.137
YOU SHOULD BE IN JAIL, MAN,
NOT THE HALL OF FAME.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.505
- SECURITY,
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.640
- YOU'RE A BUM!
YOU'RE SCUM OF THE EARTH!

01:46.674 --> 01:48.276
YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!

01:48.309 --> 01:51.412
- I, UH, GUESS I DIDN'T
GIVE HIM ENOUGH PLAYING TIME.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.913
[laughter]
[clatters]

01:52.946 --> 01:54.582
- GET OFF ME!

01:54.615 --> 01:55.749
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.353
GET OFF ME!

01:59.387 --> 02:00.688
GET OFF OF ME!

02:06.760 --> 02:08.796
- WE'RE HIRING
ANOTHER DETECTIVE?

02:08.829 --> 02:11.165
- WELL, WE'RE SHORT-STAFFED.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.433
HE'S A GOOD GUY,
OUT OF WARRANTS.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.467
HE STARTS TOMORROW.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.605
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

02:17.638 --> 02:19.740
- WELL, IT'S HARD ENOUGH
SHOWING ONE ROOKIE THE ROPES.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.908
AND NOW WE HAVE TWO.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.611
I MEAN...WHAT IS THIS,
A DAY CARE CENTER?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.879
- ELLIOT'S
NOT COMING BACK, LIV.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.184
- IT TAKES ME TWICE AS LONG

02:30.218 --> 02:31.685
TO EXPLAIN THE JOB
TO SOMEBODY ELSE

02:31.719 --> 02:32.820
AS IT DOES
TO DO IT MYSELF.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.789
- IT'S NOT YOUR CALL.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.491
NOW YOU WANT TO BE HERE,

02:37.525 --> 02:40.194
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO START
WORKING WITH OTHER DETECTIVES.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.462
ALL RIGHT? LET HIM GO.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.266
- [sighs]

02:45.299 --> 02:47.335
- AND YOU CAN START
BY PACKING UP HIS DESK.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.169
WE CAN'T KEEP IT
AS A SHRINE.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.299
- [sighs]

03:21.335 --> 03:22.470
- LIV, WE GOT SOMETHING.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.476
- THIS IS A DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.577
WHAT'S HE DOING
AT SEX CRIMES?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.313
- CLAIMS HIS BASKETBALL COACH
SEXUALLY ABUSED HIM

03:32.346 --> 03:34.282
WHEN HE WAS A KID.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.216
SAYS HE WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE, EITHER.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.554
[man groaning]

03:41.922 --> 03:43.657
THIS GUY'S JONESING.

03:43.691 --> 03:47.661
- [groaning]

03:47.695 --> 03:48.696
- GET A BUS!

04:42.082 --> 04:43.517
- HOSPITAL JUST CALLED.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.853
LAST NIGHT'S DISCON
IS STABLE.

04:45.886 --> 04:46.920
- SEE IF I CAN
GET A STATEMENT.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.558
- FOLKS, THIS IS DETECTIVE
SECOND GRADE NICK AMARO.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.559
HE JUST TRANSFERRED IN.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.494
- SECOND GRADER ALREADY, HUH?

04:53.527 --> 04:55.496
YOU MUST HAVE CAUGHT
SOME BIG FISH.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.398
- NAH, JUST KISSED
A LOT OF ASS.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.833
- DETECTIVE AMARO
IS BEING MODEST.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.635
TWO YEARS UNDER
IN NARCOTICS.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.472
WARRANTS--HE TOOK DOWN
THE MS-13 CASE.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.607
- WELL, THIS IS A WHOLE
DIFFERENT WORLD, SERPICO.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.442
NOT EVERYBODY HAS
THE STOMACH FOR IT.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.648
- FOR THE TIME BEING,
WE'RE GONNA ROTATE PARTNERS.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.617
FIN, NICK RIDES
WITH YOU TODAY.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.951
GET HIS FEET WET.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.620
OH, AND, AMARO...

05:19.653 --> 05:20.788
CLEAN YOURSELF UP.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.989
YOU'RE NOT ON THE STREET
ANYMORE.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.658
- COME ON, I GOT A GUY THAT
CAN SHAPE YOU UP REAL QUICK.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.694
- DON'T LET HIM
TAKE YOU CLOTHES SHOPPING.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.131
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.401
WHAT WAS THE DEAL
WITH BENSON'S PARTNER?

05:33.434 --> 05:34.635
I HEARD SOME THINGS.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.036
- STABLER...

05:36.069 --> 05:37.505
HE WAS A GOOD COP.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.707
HIM AND BENSON
WERE TOGETHER FOR 12 YEARS.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.510
THAT'S A DECADE LONGER
THAN MY MARRIAGE.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.577
- [chuckles]

05:51.585 --> 05:52.586
- WHERE'S MY PRISONER?

05:52.620 --> 05:54.054
- UH--UH, I DON'T KNOW.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.155
I JUST WENT TO TAKE A LEAK.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.557
- HOW LONG A LEAK
DID YOU TAKE?

05:56.590 --> 05:58.426
- HOW LOOSE WERE HIS CUFFS?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.394
- I'M SORRY, WE'LL FIND HIM.
- NO, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.496
GO TELL YOUR CAPTAIN
YOU LOST MY PRISONER.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.997
ENJOY YOUR SUSPENSION.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.868
- WAIT, STEVIE HARRIS?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.069
- LEAVE AN ADDRESS?

06:09.102 --> 06:11.071
- NAH, HE'S LISTED HIMSELF
AS HOMELESS.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.606
THIS KID WAS A LEGEND.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.542
I USED TO WATCH HIM
PLAY BALL DOWNTOWN.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.510
I KNOW WHERE HIS CREW
HANGS OUT.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.420
- YO!
LET ME SEE THE ROCK.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.060
AH!
- BRICK!

06:33.093 --> 06:35.496
- BRICK.
- YOU SEE?

06:35.529 --> 06:36.864
THAT'S WHY
HE'S JUST A FAN.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.199
BUT YOU...
YOU WERE GOOD, THOUGH.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.801
YEAH, I SAW YOU PLAY
AT THE RUCKER--

06:40.834 --> 06:42.202
HE WAS THE ONLY WHITE BOY
GETTING A RUN.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.804
- THAT WAS A LONG TIME
AGO, MAN.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.906
- YEAH. YEAH, BUT YOU
WERE PURE POINT GUARD.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.541
THAT'S RARE.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.510
ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.445
- DETECTIVE FIN TUTUOLA.

06:51.479 --> 06:54.815
THIS IS DETECTIVE AMARO
FROM SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.617
YOU WERE UNDER ARREST
LAST NIGHT.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.985
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
GET UP AND LEAVE

06:58.018 --> 06:59.987
WHENEVER YOU WANT?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.889
- [sighs]

07:01.922 --> 07:03.657
- LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE STRUNG OUT,

07:03.691 --> 07:04.725
AND I CAN HELP YOU.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.460
BUT RIGHT NOW,
WE WANNA TALK TO YOU

07:06.494 --> 07:08.095
ABOUT YOUR COACH,
RAY MASTERS.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.664
- LOOK, MAN, I WAS JUST
HIGH THE OTHER NIGHT,

07:10.698 --> 07:11.965
TALKIN' CRAZY.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.701
CAN WE JUST FORGET
THE WHOLE THING?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.603
- YOU SAYING YOU LIED
ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.605
- NAH...

07:17.638 --> 07:18.405
- LOOK, STEVE,

07:18.438 --> 07:20.641
THE COACH IS AROUND KIDS
EVERY DAY.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.775
RIGHT NOW.

07:21.809 --> 07:22.910
IF HE DID SOMETHING TO YOU,

07:22.943 --> 07:24.978
YOU NEED TO TELL US.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.981
COME ON, MAN.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.850
GET THIS OFF YOUR CHEST.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.492
- FIRST TIME,
I WAS ABOUT NINE.

07:38.526 --> 07:42.129
PLAYING FOR THE BABY BARONS,
HIS JUNIOR LEAGUE TEAM.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.497
WE WAS AT A TOURNAMENT
IN BOSTON,

07:43.531 --> 07:45.198
AND HE CAME IN
TO DO BED CHECKS,

07:45.232 --> 07:47.568
MAKE SURE
WE WERE SLEEPING.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.671
[sighs]

07:50.704 --> 07:54.207
HE SAT DOWN NEXT TO ME
AND HE STARTED...

07:54.241 --> 07:55.909
TELLING ME HOW GOOD
I WAS DOING.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.512
UH, HE'S...

07:58.546 --> 08:00.247
AND THEN HE STARTED
RUFFLING MY HAIR.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.085
AND THEN HE TURNED ME OVER

08:05.118 --> 08:07.521
AND HE STARTED
MESSING WITH ME, MAN.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.355
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

08:08.388 --> 08:10.858
- COME ON, MAN.
YOU NEED A ROAD MAP?

08:12.926 --> 08:13.994
- OKAY, LISTEN, STEVE,

08:14.027 --> 08:15.563
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE HARD,

08:15.596 --> 08:17.297
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY

08:17.330 --> 08:19.166
WHAT HE DID TO YOU, OKAY?

08:20.968 --> 08:25.906
DID HE USE HIS HAND,
HIS MOUTH?

08:25.939 --> 08:28.108
- YEAH, MAN.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.210
- DID HE MAKE YOU TOUCH HIM?

08:30.243 --> 08:32.713
- NOT THE FIRST TIME, NAH.
BUT LATER ON, MAN.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.847
IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.818
- DID HE EVER RAPE YOU?

08:37.851 --> 08:42.122
- NAH, MAN, HE JUST...

08:42.155 --> 08:44.057
HE JUST PUT IT AGAINST ME,
AND HE'D MOVE IT AROUND.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.559
BUT, DAMN.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.160
[sobbing]

08:51.832 --> 08:53.266
- DID YOU EVER TELL ANYBODY?

08:56.003 --> 08:57.270
- WHY NOT?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.272
- COACH RAY WAS LIKE
A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY, MAN.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.473
HE WAS LIKE AN UNCLE.

09:00.507 --> 09:04.244
HE TOLD ME HE COULD HELP ME
GET A SCHOLARSHIP, MAN. D-1.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.879
I HELP HIM,
HE HELPS ME, MAN.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.581
IT WAS...

09:07.615 --> 09:09.116
IT WAS OUR LITTLE SECRET.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.253
- WHEN DID HE STOP
ABUSING YOU?

09:13.286 --> 09:17.658
- I MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 15.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.326
THERE WERE OTHER KIDS
HE LIKED BETTER.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.630
I THINK I GOT TOO OLD.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.297
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY, MAN?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.600
THAT'S WHEN THINGS REALLY
STARTED FALLING APART.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.368
I STARTED GETTING HIGH.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.239
IT WAS AFTER HE STOPPED.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.242
- LOOK, STEVIE,
YOU HAVE ANYTHING

09:35.275 --> 09:36.844
THAT COULD HELP US
PROVE THIS?

09:36.877 --> 09:39.079
A WITNESS, ANOTHER VICTIM?

09:39.112 --> 09:41.348
- NO.
- SOMETIMES PEOPLE KEEP CLOTHES.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.985
- I'M A JUNKIE, MAN.
I DON'T KEEP ANYTHING.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.821
BUT HE WAS PAYING ME OFF.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.790
- WHAT?
PAYING YOU OFF?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.091
WAS IT HUSH MONEY?

09:51.124 --> 09:54.662
- EVERY MONTH.
IT WAS KEEPING ME ALIVE.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.097
TILL RIGHT AFTER
MY LAST BIRTHDAY, IT STOPPED.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.607
- COME ON, GREEN, LET'S GO!

10:11.745 --> 10:14.214
[indistinct chatter]

10:14.247 --> 10:15.849
BALL, BALL, BALL!

10:15.883 --> 10:16.850
- YO, RIGHT HERE!
- OHH!

10:16.884 --> 10:18.385
- UHH!
- [indistinct]

10:18.418 --> 10:19.887
[applause]

10:19.920 --> 10:21.655
- WHOA, THAT KID GETS UP.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.791
- THAT'S DEVON TISWELL,
BROTHER.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.425
THEY CALL HIM
THE STAR CHILD.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.128
SUPPOSED TO BE THE NEXT
GREAT CITY BALLER.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.197
HEY, COACH!
GOT A MINUTE?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.936
- I'VE SEEN A LOT OF SAD CASES
OVER THE YEARS,

10:35.969 --> 10:38.405
BUT STEVIE HARRIS
IS A REAL HEARTBREAKER.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.307
HE WAS A MAGICIAN
WITH THE BALL,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.209
LIKE A COACH ON THE FLOOR.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.111
I REALLY THOUGHT
HE WOULD GO FAR.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.779
- WHAT HAPPENED?

10:45.813 --> 10:48.215
- I FOUND THAT SUCCESS
IN LIFE

10:48.248 --> 10:50.317
COMES DOWN TO HOW WELL
YOU HANDLE PRESSURE.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.921
STEVIE JUST WASN'T WIRED FOR IT.
IT'S A SHAME.

10:53.954 --> 10:57.090
- SO WHY DO YOU THINK
HE'D CALL YOU OUT LIKE THAT?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.959
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.260
IT'S DISTURBING.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.194
I'D NEVER HURT
ONE OF MY KIDS.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.797
I DEDICATED MY WHOLE LIFE
TO HELPING THEM.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.432
- THAT'S A PRETTY BIG
MISUNDERSTANDING.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.000
- SOMETIMES,
PEOPLE DON'T WANT

11:07.034 --> 11:09.069
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THEIR FAILURES.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.404
THEY WANT TO BLAME
SOMEBODY ELSE.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.874
THAT'S A SOCIETAL PROBLEM
RIGHT NOW.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.408
THE BLAME GAME.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.411
- STEVIE SAYS YOU WERE
PAYING HIM OFF TO KEEP QUIET.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.280
HUSH MONEY.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.381
- HUSH MONEY?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.083
IS THAT WHAT
THEY'RE CALLING IT?

11:23.116 --> 11:25.485
THAT'S JU--

11:25.518 --> 11:27.420
LOOK, AHEM...

11:27.454 --> 11:30.290
I TRY TO HELP OUT MY KIDS
ANY WAY I CAN.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.492
THEY DON'T ALL MAKE IT OUT.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.495
NOW, MAYBE I DID LOAN STEVIE
MONEY FROM TIME TO TIME,

11:35.528 --> 11:37.865
BUT WHEN I SAW IT WAS JUST
GOING UP HIS ARM,

11:37.898 --> 11:38.899
I CUT HIM OFF.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.071
- THANKS, COACH,
FOR YOUR TIME.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.238
YOU CAN GET BACK
TO PRACTICE.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.240
- OF COURSE.
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.709
I REALLY RESPECT THE JOB
YOU GUYS DO.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.748
- HEY, DEVON.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.449
HEY, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD
OUT THERE.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.885
- AH, THANKS, MAN.
- WHAT'S IT LIKE,

11:57.918 --> 11:59.853
PLAYING FOR A LEGEND
LIKE RAY MASTERS?

11:59.887 --> 12:02.122
- UH, COACH GOT
ALL THE CONNECTS, YOU KNOW?

12:02.155 --> 12:06.126
COLLEGE AND SNEAKERS
AND EVEN THE PROS.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.462
- YOU DO FOR RAY,
RAY DO FOR YOU.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.298
THE MAN'S THE TICKET OUT.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.070
- YOU KNOW
ABUSE OF POWER CASES

12:17.104 --> 12:18.405
BOTHER ME MORE THAN MOST,

12:18.438 --> 12:20.407
BUT THERE'S BIG ISSUES
WITH THE OUTCRY.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.842
- HE'S STILL COACHING,
CAPTAIN.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.476
I JUST THINK WE NEED
TO DOT THE Is

12:23.510 --> 12:25.178
AND CROSS THE Ts
ON THIS ONE.

12:25.212 --> 12:28.015
- THERE'S NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.
NO CORROBORATING WITNESSES.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.983
NOT TO MENTION
OUR COMPLAINANT

12:30.017 --> 12:31.451
HAS A LONG HISTORY
OF DRUG ARRESTS.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.787
- DOESN'T MEAN SOMETHING BAD
DIDN'T HAPPEN TO HIM.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.422
GUY'S STILL HUMAN.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.456
- I'M PULLING STRINGS

12:36.489 --> 12:37.925
TO GET HIM INTO
OUTPATIENT REHAB.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.893
I THINK STEVIE'S READY
TO GET CLEAN.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.361
- WELL, THAT'S ALL
WELL AND GOOD.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.030
BUT THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS HAS RUN OUT.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.198
- WAIT, ON CHILD
SEX ABUSE CHARGES?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.200
- STEVIE'S NOT ALLEGING
FORCIBLE RAPE.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.937
AND IN NEW YORK, THE CHARGES
ONLY CARRY TO 18 YEARS OF AGE.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.940
PLUS FIVE, THAT'S 23.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.507
STEVIE TURNED 24 IN MARCH.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.344
- MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE STOPPED
PAYING STEVIE OFF.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.312
HE COULDN'T BE CHARGED
ANYMORE.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.113
- OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.015
IF YOU CAN PROVE
PAYMENTS WERE MADE

13:02.049 --> 13:05.352
AND SHOW THAT THEY WERE
MEANT TO BUY THE KID'S SILENCE,

13:05.385 --> 13:06.854
THEN THEY WOULD BE
PART AND PARCEL

13:06.887 --> 13:08.088
WITH AN ONGOING CRIME.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.857
- WHICH WOULD MEAN
THE CLOCK IS STILL TICKING

13:09.890 --> 13:10.924
ON THE STATUTE?

13:10.958 --> 13:12.459
- RIGHT NOW,
IT'S OUR ONLY SHOT.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.460
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY,

13:13.493 --> 13:15.528
BECAUSE COACH MASTERS
HAS NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.497
- NOT IN NEW YORK,
HE DOESN'T.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.000
BUT THERE WAS A CHARGE
AGAINST HIM IN TRENTON

13:20.033 --> 13:21.401
BACK IN '88.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.071
IT WAS SEALED,
AND THEN IT WAS EXPUNGED.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.939
BE NICE TO FIND OUT WHY.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.140
- WELL, I'LL MAKE A FEW CALLS.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.476
NEW JERSEY
LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.481
- PROBABLY SOPHOMORE YEAR

13:34.514 --> 13:36.984
WHEN RICHIE STARTED
LOSING HIS SHINE.

13:37.017 --> 13:40.153
HE WAS ALWAYS
A SMILEY-FACED KID.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.456
SUDDENLY, HE'S QUIET,
NOT EATING.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.159
DOESN'T EVEN WANT
TO PLAY BALL ANYMORE.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.095
AND THAT WAS THE LOVE
OF HIS LIFE.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.964
- BESIDES HIS MOM, HUH?

13:50.998 --> 13:54.134
- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED,
MRS. RAMOS?

13:54.167 --> 13:57.070
- I STARTED DIGGING AT RICHIE.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.639
HE COULDN'T KEEP
A SECRET FROM ME.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.375
AND FINALLY, HE TOLD ME

14:02.409 --> 14:04.477
WHAT COACH RAY WAS DOING.

14:04.511 --> 14:08.048
- WHICH WAS WHAT, EXACTLY?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.883
- TOUCHING HIM.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.585
MOLESTING HIM.
WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT.

14:25.432 --> 14:29.402
IT STARTED AT A TOURNAMENT
IN PHILLY, WHEN HE WAS 12.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.405
I WANTED TO GET A GUN
AND SHOOT THE MAN IN HIS NUTS.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.642
THAT WAS MY BABY.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.545
THE CHURCH KEPT IT QUIET.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.413
TOLD ME
THEY WOULD HANDLE IT.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.215
I WAITED AND WAITED.

14:42.249 --> 14:45.118
NOTHING HAPPENED.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.486
- SO IS THAT WHEN
YOU CALLED THE POLICE?

14:46.519 --> 14:49.089
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FIND
ANY ARTICLES ABOUT IT.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.158
- BECAUSE THEY PROTECTED HIM.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.026
THEY LOVED COACH.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.263
I HAD TO BEG THEM
TO DO THEIR JOB.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.532
TWO DAYS BEFORE
THE GRAND JURY,

14:59.566 --> 15:04.071
MY SON HUNG HIMSELF HERE,
IN THIS ROOM.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.442
AFTER THAT...

15:14.114 --> 15:17.184
YOU GOING TO GET HIM
THIS TIME?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.381
- I'M USED TO BEING
THE EARLIEST BIRD.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.550
- I HEARD YOU AND BENSON
GOT A HIT IN JERSEY.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.420
- YEP, COACH HAS BEEN
AT THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.188
HE'S A BAD GUY.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.289
- NAH. I'M GOOD.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.691
- IT'S THE LAST OF MY VICES,
I HOPE.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.228
- COP WHO DOESN'T
EAT DOUGHNUTS?

16:01.261 --> 16:02.529
HOW CAN I TRUST YOU?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.633
- FRESH BLOOD.
READY TO WORK.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.135
WHERE ARE WE ON COACH RAY?

16:08.168 --> 16:10.303
- I'VE BEEN GOING OVER
COACH'S FINANCES.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.371
THEY'RE CLEAN.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.206
IF HE'S BEEN MAKING
MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO STEVIE,

16:13.240 --> 16:15.108
THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP
IN HIS STATEMENTS.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.409
AND HIS INCOME, 50K,

16:16.443 --> 16:18.078
THAT DOESN'T LEAVE HIM
A LOT LEFT OVER.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.680
- 50K? MAN, HE'S GOT
ALL KINDS OF SHADY BUSINESS

16:20.713 --> 16:23.216
WITH AGENTS, SNEAKER COMPANIES,
COLLEGE RECRUITERS.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.651
- OKAY, SO WHERE'S
HE HIDING IT?

16:24.684 --> 16:27.054
- YOU KNOW, WE HAD A BAD COACH
IN ATLANTA.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.289
IT WAS FOOTBALL.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.758
HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNTS
WERE SQUEAKY CLEAN TOO,

16:31.791 --> 16:33.626
BUT HIS CHARITABLE
FOUNDATION...

16:35.062 --> 16:37.797
THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.767
- RAY'S BOYS FOUNDATION.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.403
RAY'S BOYS. WOW.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.205
- OKAY, ROLLINS,
START COMBING THROUGH

16:45.238 --> 16:46.406
THE FOUNDATION'S RECORDS.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.674
IF STEVIE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH,

16:47.707 --> 16:49.442
HE'S NOT THE ONLY GUY
GETTING HUSH MONEY.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.710
- I'M ON IT, CAPTAIN.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.583
- HEY, YOU DOING OKAY?

16:56.616 --> 16:58.518
GOOD. GOOD.
SO, UH...

16:58.551 --> 17:00.487
MAYBE YOU COULD
HELP THE NEW GUYS OUT A LITTLE.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.222
OKAY?

17:07.394 --> 17:09.162
- DETECTIVES.
HOW CAN I--

17:09.196 --> 17:12.065
- RICHIE RAMOS.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.766
RICHIE RAMOS?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.236
HE MADE A SEX ABUSE CHARGE
AGAINST YOU IN '88?

17:16.269 --> 17:20.607
HE HUNG HIMSELF TWO DAYS
BEFORE THE GRAND JURY.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.575
STILL NOT RINGING ANY BELLS?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.713
- I SEE YOU'VE SPOKEN
WITH THE MOTHER.

17:26.746 --> 17:30.417
HMM. FINDING ALL THE JOKERS
IN THE DECK, AREN'T YOU?

17:30.450 --> 17:31.818
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

17:31.851 --> 17:33.486
- PLEASE.

17:34.854 --> 17:38.658
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT
THERE...WASN'T ANY FATHER?

17:38.691 --> 17:41.528
THAT SHE WAS ABUSING DRUGS.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.430
AND THAT I WAS THE ONE
WHO GOT HIM OUT OF THE SHELTER

17:43.463 --> 17:45.265
AND FOUND THEM HOUSING.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.235
THAT WHEN I MET RICHIE,
HE WAS FUNCTIONALLY ILLITERATE,

17:48.268 --> 17:49.436
AND FIVE YEARS LATER,

17:49.469 --> 17:51.438
HE WAS SET UP
FOR A FULL RIDE AT ARIZONA.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.773
SHE MENTION ANY
OF THOSE LITTLE DETAILS?

17:56.176 --> 17:59.612
I WAS THE ONE
TRYING TO SAVE THAT KID.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.548
SHE WAS THE ONE
WHO DESTROYED HIM.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.216
- WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

18:03.250 --> 18:05.418
- BECAUSE SHE HAD
THIS IDEA ABOUT ME

18:05.452 --> 18:06.453
THAT SHE WOULDN'T LET GO.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.855
- WHY WOULD SHE HAVE--
- HOLD ON.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.590
AND WHAT IDEA WAS THAT?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.725
- LET'S NOT BE CHILDREN,
DETECTIVE.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.294
IT'S THE SAME ONE YOU HAVE.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.862
- AM I WRONG?

18:20.567 --> 18:23.403
- THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
A COACH AND A STAR PLAYER

18:23.436 --> 18:24.737
IS VERY INTENSE.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.607
EASILY MISUNDERSTOOD.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.442
- GO ON.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.745
- MOST OF THESE KIDS
GET ONE CHANCE AT A FUTURE.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.714
I'M IN A POSITION
TO HELP THEM.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.383
WE GET VERY CLOSE.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.451
- THAT'S A LOT OF POWER.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.520
DECIDING WHO STAYS
AND WHO GOES.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.155
- IT'S MY JOB.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.423
FIND THE SPECIAL ONES.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.458
- SO YOU HAVE
THE GOLDEN TICKET, HUH?

18:45.492 --> 18:48.161
SO WHAT DO YOU ASK FOR
IN RETURN?

18:48.195 --> 18:50.897
- THAT THEY SUCCEED IN LIFE.
PAY IT FORWARD.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.333
- SORT OF LIKE YOU
PAY THEM TO KEEP QUIET.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.502
'CAUSE YOUR FOUNDATION,
IT SEEMS LIKE THE MISSION

18:55.535 --> 18:58.271
IS TO, UH, BUY SILENCE.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.509
- SHAME ON YOU.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.479
MY FOUNDATION,
MY WHOLE LIFE

19:06.513 --> 19:08.248
IS ABOUT
HELPING THESE KIDS.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.650
- THINK THE LAW
CAN'T TOUCH YOU...COACH?

19:13.486 --> 19:16.323
YOU TALK TO ANY OF MY BOYS!

19:16.356 --> 19:18.391
THEY'LL TELL YOU
THAT I'M THE ONLY FATHER

19:18.425 --> 19:21.561
MOST OF THEM EVER HAD!

19:21.594 --> 19:22.562
- SO YOU'RE
TRYING TO TELL US

19:22.595 --> 19:24.631
HE PAID YOU OUT OF
THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.799
- YOU GUYS GOT IT ALL WRONG
ABOUT HIM.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.301
MY SON, HE'S NINE.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.670
I'M ENROLLING HIM
IN BABY BARONS NEXT YEAR.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.605
COACH IS JUST
HELPING ME OUT, ALL RIGHT?

19:32.639 --> 19:33.540
IS THAT A CRIME?

19:33.573 --> 19:35.708
HE NEVER DID ANYTHING TO ME,
UNDERSTAND?

19:35.742 --> 19:38.511
- NEVER SAID HE DID, DAVIS.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.447
- YOU KNOW,
HE'S STILL COACHING.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.749
HE'S STILL NOT DOING WHATEVER
HE DIDN'T DO TO YOU.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.618
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

19:45.652 --> 19:47.887
SO WHAT WAS HE
PAYING YOU FOR?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.856
- YARD WORK...DETECTIVE.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.558
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.295
- COACH GIVES ME MONEY
WHEN I'M BROKE.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.364
AND ADVICE
WHEN I NEED IT.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.931
EVEN HAD ME AND MY MOM
OVER FOR CHRISTMAS

19:58.965 --> 20:00.900
AT HIS HOUSE ONE YEAR.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.635
MAN IS SANTA CLAUS.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.305
- YOU THINK I'D LET ANOTHER MAN
PUT HIS HANDS ON MY BODY?

20:05.338 --> 20:06.473
YOU CRAZY!

20:06.506 --> 20:07.907
I'LL SNAP HIS NECK,
HE'LL TRY THAT!

20:07.940 --> 20:09.742
I LOOK LIKE
SOMEBODY'S BITCH TO YOU?

20:09.776 --> 20:10.710
DO I?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.445
- TAKE IT EASY, DRE.
- GET OFF OF ME, MAN!

20:12.479 --> 20:14.414
- COACH KNEW HOW
TO PICK HIS VICTIMS.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.549
- YEAH, WE DIDN'T
HAVE A LOT

20:16.583 --> 20:18.585
OF MALE-ON-MALE DISCLOSURES
DOWN IN ATLANTA.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.520
- HERE, NEITHER.
NOBODY REPORTS.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.890
PLUS, THEY'RE TRICKY
TO PROSECUTE.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.492
- YEAH, I HAD A SEX CRIMES
PROFESSOR SAY

20:25.525 --> 20:27.594
THAT MALE VICTIMS ARE WHERE
FEMALE VICS WERE

20:27.627 --> 20:28.628
40 YEARS AGO.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.263
YOU KNOW,
IT'S THE DARK AGES.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.031
MEN FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD
BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.801
- ABSOLUTELY, AND SOME VICS
EXPERIENCE AROUSAL,

20:34.834 --> 20:36.703
WHICH IS A NORMAL
PHYSICAL RESPONSE,

20:36.736 --> 20:38.438
BUT THEY WORRY
THAT MEANS CONSENT.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.540
- OR THAT PEOPLE
MIGHT THINK THEY'RE GAY.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.641
- WELL, IT'S STILL
A BIG STIGMA

20:41.674 --> 20:43.543
IN THE BLACK AND LATINO
COMMUNITY.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.412
MY SON'S GAY,
AND HE HAS TO DEAL

20:45.445 --> 20:46.979
WITH THAT GARBAGE
ON THE STREETS EVERY DAY.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.715
[buzzer]

20:48.748 --> 20:50.650
HE'S THE BRAVEST MAN I KNOW.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.591
- I MEAN, MY COUNSELOR
BROKE IT DOWN LIKE THIS.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.759
AS AN ADDICT,
YOU WAKE UP EVERY MORNING

20:59.792 --> 21:01.494
WITH NO JOB AND NO MONEY.

21:01.528 --> 21:02.562
BUT BY THE END OF THE DAY,

21:02.595 --> 21:05.498
YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO FIX UP AND GET STRAIGHT.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.467
IF I CAN CHANNEL THAT FOCUS
INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE,

21:07.500 --> 21:08.835
I'D BE UNSTOPPABLE.

21:08.868 --> 21:09.936
- AH, THAT'S GREAT, STEVEN.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.371
- I THINK
JUST TELLING YOU GUYS

21:11.404 --> 21:12.605
WAS A BIG RELIEF,
YOU KNOW?

21:12.639 --> 21:13.573
ONCE YOU PUT COACH AWAY,

21:13.606 --> 21:15.808
I THINK I COULD FINALLY
GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.444
- I THINK YOU CAN,
TOO, STEVIE.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.512
THAT'S WHY
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.414
'CAUSE WE'VE HIT
A BRICK WALL.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.350
- WHAT, I THOUGHT YOU FOUND
OTHER GUYS HE PAID OFF.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.584
- YEAH, WE DID.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.718
THE THING IS
IS THAT...

21:25.752 --> 21:27.954
THEY ALL SWEAR THAT COACH
WAS JUST HELPING THEM OUT.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.590
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY GOT HUSH MONEY.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.426
- OR...HE DIDN'T
MESS WITH THEM.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.761
- OH, AND COACH
IS SOME GREAT MAN,

21:34.794 --> 21:35.995
AND I'M JUST
A ADDICT, RIGHT?

21:36.028 --> 21:38.097
- RIGHT NOW, IT'S YOUR WORD
AGAINST HIS,

21:38.130 --> 21:39.466
AND A DOZEN FORMER PLAYERS--

21:39.499 --> 21:41.000
- NO, NO, STEVIE.
LISTEN TO ME.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.636
WE JUST NEED SOMEBODY ELSE
TO COME FORWARD.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.505
SOMEBODY WHO'S YOUNGER,

21:45.538 --> 21:47.106
WHO'S NOT
ON THE FOUNDATION'S DOLE.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.542
THAT'S HOW WE'RE
GONNA GET THIS GUY.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.615
- THERE IS SOMEBODY.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.086
MY ROOMMATE
AT THE TOURNAMENTS.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.488
MY BEST FRIEND GROWING UP.

22:01.521 --> 22:04.023
I THINK HE GOT IT
WORSE THAN ME.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.525
- YOU'RE SAYING
THAT HE WAS RAPED?

22:05.558 --> 22:07.627
- I THINK SO.

22:09.596 --> 22:10.930
- WHO IS HE, STEVIE?

22:10.963 --> 22:13.633
- HE'S TOO BIG, MAN.
HE'LL NEVER TALK TO YOU.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.034
- HOLD ON, STEVIE.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.770
YOU NEED TO TELL US
WHO IT IS.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.413
- PRINCE MILLER?

22:40.860 --> 22:43.162
[hip hop music]

22:43.195 --> 22:44.831
- * IT'S PRINCE
- * IT'S THE PRINCE

22:44.864 --> 22:46.599
- * IT'S THE PRINCE
- * IT'S PRINCE

22:46.633 --> 22:48.535
- * THERE'S THAT MAN AGAIN
- * YEAH, I'M COMIN'

22:48.568 --> 22:49.769
- * IT'S PRINCE
- * IT'S THE PRINCE

22:49.802 --> 22:52.905
- * IT'S THE PRINCE...
- * IT'S PRINCE

22:52.939 --> 22:54.941
[clippers buzzing]

22:54.974 --> 22:57.444
- HEY, DETECTIVES,
COME ON IN.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.679
I'M SUPREME,
PRINCE'S BUSINESS MANAGER.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.813
I'M ALSO HIS COUSIN.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.449
SO YOU KNOW
THE BLOOD RUNS DEEP.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.716
- THANKS FOR HAVING US.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.952
- UH, AS I SAID,
THIS IS A SENSITIVE MATTER.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.421
- YEAH, GIVE US A MINUTE.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.161
- NICE KICKS.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.663
- OH, YEAH, THANKS.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.864
THESE ARE RC-13s.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.433
PROTOTYPE FROM
OUR KOREAN FACTORY.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.534
ONLY PAIR IN EXISTENCE.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.869
PRINCE DON'T EVEN
HAVE THESE YET.

23:22.902 --> 23:23.670
- LOVE THAT SHADE OF RED.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.172
- PRINCE'S COLORS.
I CHOSE THESE.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.140
YOU SEE, WE DESIGN
AND WE MANUFACTURE EVERYTHING.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.809
NO ONE EXPLOITS US.

23:29.842 --> 23:30.877
NOT TOO BAD, HUH?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.480
TWO CATS FROM BROWNSVILLE.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.847
- THE AMERICAN DREAM.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.115
- YOU DAMN RIGHT.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.950
HEY, MAN, YOU GOT
YOUR 20 YEARS IN YET?

23:37.984 --> 23:39.719
I MEAN, WHEN YOU PUT
YOUR PAPERS IN,

23:39.752 --> 23:40.820
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON DOWN
AND WORK FOR ME.

23:40.853 --> 23:44.591
I TAKE REAL GOOD CARE
OF MY SOLDIERS.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.025
- NO JOB FOR ME, SUPREME?

23:46.058 --> 23:47.560
- I DON'T KNOW, SWEETHEART.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.561
UH...

23:48.595 --> 23:49.629
CAN YOU DANCE?

23:49.662 --> 23:51.831
[chortling]

23:51.864 --> 23:52.932
HEY, PRINCE IS HERE.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.036
- YOU BROUGHT IN
DAVID ARNOFF?

23:57.069 --> 23:58.871
THAT'S A BIG GUN.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.907
- DELICATE TIMES, DETECTIVE.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.776
PRINCE IS AN MVP.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.977
TWO-TIME CHAMPION.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.613
AND NOW HE'S A FREE AGENT
BEING WOOED

24:06.646 --> 24:08.147
BY EVERY TEAM
IN THE LEAGUE.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.883
YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET ANYTHING OR ANYBODY

24:10.917 --> 24:14.654
COME IN HERE
AND DESTROY WHAT WE BUILT.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.723
- COACH USED TO SAY SUCCESS
HAS A LOT TO DO

24:16.756 --> 24:18.958
WITH HOW WELL
YOU HANDLE PRESSURE.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.494
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
HE PREPARED ME FOR SUCCESS.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.863
- HOW MUCH PRESSURE
DID HE APPLY?

24:23.896 --> 24:25.898
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
AT THE END OF THE GAME,

24:25.932 --> 24:27.166
BALL WAS ALWAYS
IN MY HANDS.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.502
CLOCK TICKING DOWN,
TOP OF THE KEY.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.203
I'D BE IN A TRIPLE THREAT
POSITION.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.072
I COULD DRIVE, SHOOT, PASS.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.841
DIDN'T MATTER WHAT DEFENSE
THEY THREW AT ME.

24:34.874 --> 24:35.908
THEY COULDN'T STOP ME.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.777
THERE MAY NOT BE
AN "I" IN "TEAM,"

24:37.810 --> 24:39.211
BUT THERE'S DAMN SURE
ONE IN "WIN."

24:39.245 --> 24:41.047
- HEH, TELL 'EM.
[laughs]

24:41.080 --> 24:43.282
- PRINCE, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT ON THE COURT.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.884
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
IN YOUR LIFE.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.854
- PRINCE, DID YOU
CONSIDER COACH A...

24:47.887 --> 24:50.557
A FATHER FIGURE
OR A MENTOR?

24:50.590 --> 24:53.225
- LOOK...ME, MY MOTHER,
AND MY BROTHERS,

24:53.259 --> 24:55.595
WE STARTED OFF IN ONE ROOM
IN THE TILDEN HOUSES.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.764
AND NOW WE LIVE
IN A 40,000 SQUARE FOOT ESTATE

24:57.797 --> 24:59.932
IN BERNARDSVILLE,
NEW JERSEY.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.001
LAMBORGHINI MURCIELAGO'S
MY KNOCK-AROUND CAR.

25:02.034 --> 25:06.038
NOTHING HAS GONE WRONG
IN MY LIFE.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.874
OKAY?

25:09.876 --> 25:11.878
- PRINCE, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

25:11.911 --> 25:14.814
CAN YOU TAKE OFF
YOUR GLASSES?

25:14.847 --> 25:16.148
I WANNA SEE YOUR EYES.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.121
- THANK YOU FOR COMING BY.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.090
YOU HAVE OUR STATEMENT.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.093
- TALKED ABOUT GUARDED.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.828
PRINCE IS GONNA BE
A HARD ONE TO CRACK.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.097
- SOME VICS BREAK DOWN,
LIKE STEVIE,

25:31.130 --> 25:32.999
AND OTHERS BECOME
SUPER-HIGH ACHIEVERS,

25:33.032 --> 25:35.668
LIKE PRINCE, TRYING TO PROVE
TO THE WORLD THEY'RE OKAY.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.937
- YEAH, I'M NOT SO SURE
THAT PRINCE IS OKAY.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.071
LOOK AT THIS.

25:39.105 --> 25:42.208
I'VE BEEN WATCHING COACH RAY'S
HALL OF FAME INDUCTION.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.277
EVERY STAR PLAYER
THAT HE EVER COACHED IS THERE.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.579
BUT PRINCE DOESN'T SHOW UP.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.815
HE JUST SENDS
HIS GOLDEN KEY INSTEAD?

25:48.848 --> 25:51.984
- WELL, PRINCE DOESN'T
WANT TO FACE HIM.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.854
UH...I GOTTA
CALL MY WIFE.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.956
- SHORT LEASH?

25:56.989 --> 25:57.857
- NOT EXACTLY.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.692
SHE'S IN IRAQ.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.893
IT'S A SEVEN-HOUR DIFFERENCE.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.361
- IRAQ?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.997
- SHE'S IN PROPAGANDA,
YOU KNOW, JUST...

26:05.031 --> 26:06.165
TRYING TO WIN
HEARTS AND MINDS.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.167
SHE'S GOT EIGHT MONTHS TO GO.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.803
IF ANYONE COULD DO IT,
IT'S HER.

26:10.837 --> 26:11.838
- STEVIE.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.072
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

26:13.105 --> 26:14.974
- DID YOU GUYS
MEET WITH PRINCE?

26:15.007 --> 26:16.075
- YEAH.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.143
- I THOUGHT SO.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.310
HE CALLED ME.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.847
HADN'T HEARD FROM HIM
IN EIGHT YEARS.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.914
- WHAT'D HE WANT?

26:21.948 --> 26:23.315
- HE INVITED ME
TO HIS CLUB TONIGHT.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.684
HE SAID HE WAS
THINKING ABOUT ME,

26:24.717 --> 26:26.853
WANTED TO CATCH UP.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.155
I GOT TWO QUESTIONS
FOR Y'ALL:

26:29.188 --> 26:31.758
HOW YOU WANT ME TO PLAY IT,
AND...

26:31.791 --> 26:35.327
WHAT THE HELL
AM I GONNA WEAR?

26:35.361 --> 26:37.864
- WELL, HOW ABOUT A WIRE?

26:37.897 --> 26:40.399
- WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
PROPOSING, DETECTIVES?

26:40.432 --> 26:41.968
- A CONTROLLED MEET.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.335
LOOK, I'VE DONE A LOT OF THEM.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.804
WE WIRE STEVIE UP

26:44.837 --> 26:46.305
AND HEAR WHAT PRINCE MILLER
HAS TO SAY TO HIM.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.207
- THIS IS SEX CRIMES,
NOT NARCOTICS.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.976
WE CAN'T HAVE VICTIMS
MEET ON THE RECORD LIKE THAT.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.077
THE DEFENSE'LL SAY THEY'RE

26:51.110 --> 26:52.645
TRYING TO GET
THEIR STORY STRAIGHT.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.346
- WE THINK THAT PRINCE
GOT IT WORSE THAN STEVIE DID.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.949
IF WE CAN JUST GET HIM ON TAPE
ADMITTING TO BEING RAPED,

26:56.983 --> 26:58.350
THEN THE STATUTE
DOESN'T APPLY.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.919
- AH, IT'S RISKY, LIV.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.954
COLLUSIONARY.
OR WORSE.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.155
IF PRINCE DENIES
ANYTHING HAPPENED,

27:03.189 --> 27:04.824
IT'S MEMORIALIZED ON TAPE.

27:04.857 --> 27:05.892
- WE GET IT, COUNSELOR.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.226
BUT DO YOU HAVE
A BETTER IDEA?

27:07.259 --> 27:09.195
- HEY, RELAX.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.698
- MAYBE I DO.

27:11.731 --> 27:14.767
YOU SAY ALL THE INCIDENTS
OF ABUSE HAPPENED IN NEW YORK?

27:14.801 --> 27:16.736
- NAH, IT WAS MOSTLY
ON THE ROAD--

27:16.769 --> 27:18.771
CALIFORNIA, BOSTON, PHILLY.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.907
- BOSTON...ARE YOU SURE?

27:20.940 --> 27:21.908
- YEAH. WHY?

27:21.941 --> 27:23.109
- BECAUSE IN MASSACHUSETTS,

27:23.142 --> 27:26.012
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
WOULD NOT APPLY IN THIS CASE.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.213
- WHY NOT?

27:27.246 --> 27:28.347
- UP THERE,
THEY STOP THE CLOCK

27:28.380 --> 27:29.982
ON A CHILD
SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGE

27:30.016 --> 27:32.251
THE MINUTE A VICTIM OR A PERP
LEAVES THE STATE.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.854
- WHAT IS THAT, SOME SORT
OF LOCAL MANN ACT?

27:34.887 --> 27:37.389
- NO...DIOCESE REASSIGNING
PEDOPHILE PRIESTS

27:37.423 --> 27:39.892
TO OTHER NEW ENGLAND STATES
UNTIL THE CLOCK RAN OUT.

27:39.926 --> 27:43.429
- SO THE LEGISLATURE
STOPPED THE CLOCK RETROACTIVELY.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.664
- BRING IN STEVIE HARRIS.
I'LL CALL THE BOSTON D.A.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.070
- OLIVIA...

27:51.103 --> 27:53.706
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT ELLIOT.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.377
- ME TOO.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.879
- THE NEW GUY.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.914
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT?

28:01.948 --> 28:03.816
- HEY, STEVIE TOOK OFF.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.017
SAID HE HAD TO GO
TO A MEET.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.086
- CALL HIM ON HIS CELL.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.722
- YEAH.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.291
- YOU GOTTA STOP
TELLING THOSE LIES!

28:12.324 --> 28:13.726
- YOU KNOW THEY
AIN'T LIES, MAN!

28:13.760 --> 28:15.895
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
- COACH IS STILL DOING IT!

28:15.928 --> 28:17.930
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH, YOU LITTLE
JUNKIE, TRICK-ASS BITCH.

28:17.964 --> 28:18.865
[tires screech]

28:18.898 --> 28:21.300
- [indistinct]

28:21.333 --> 28:22.501
- UHH!
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

28:22.534 --> 28:23.870
ENOUGH! ENOUGH!

28:23.903 --> 28:25.337
HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH!
HEY, ENOUGH!

28:25.371 --> 28:27.039
I SAID ENOUGH!
- NYPD! WHOA!

28:27.073 --> 28:28.174
BACK UP!

28:32.511 --> 28:34.146
- MAN, YOU CAN'T
HIDE FOREVER, MAN!

28:34.180 --> 28:36.983
- YOU'RE CRAZY!
- STEVIE, STEVIE.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.050
HOLD ON.
- GET OFF ME, MAN!

28:38.084 --> 28:39.218
- HEY, WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.320
- YOU WANNA TALK TO ME,
THEN ARREST ME.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.889
IF NOT, I HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS, MAN.

28:42.922 --> 28:43.956
[spits]

28:43.990 --> 28:44.791
- HEY, COME ON.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.926
- JUST STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM ME!

28:55.034 --> 28:56.002
- YEAH.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.937
ALL RIGHT.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.806
I JUST CHECKED
WITH REHAB.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.140
STEVIE STILL
HASN'T TURNED UP.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.842
HE'S NOT
ANSWERING HIS PHONE.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.011
- SO CABOT FINALLY
FINDS A WAY TO BRING CHARGES,

29:05.044 --> 29:06.312
AND WE LOST OUR WITNESS.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.479
- WHAT ABOUT PRINCE?

29:07.513 --> 29:09.015
IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE WAS LOSING HIS COOL.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.249
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE
ANOTHER CRACK AT HIM.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.852
- FREE AGENT BIDDING WAR THAT'S
ABOUT TO START UP WITH HIM?

29:12.885 --> 29:14.553
GOOD LUCK.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.889
THAT SON OF A BITCH
COST ME A LOT OF MONEY.

29:16.923 --> 29:17.990
- HOW MUCH?

29:18.024 --> 29:18.991
- DON'T ASK.
[cell phone ringing]

29:19.025 --> 29:21.360
I HAD CAROLINA IN THE POOL
A FEW YEARS BACK.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.261
- AMARO.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.963
- WHEN PRINCE HIT
THAT BUZZER BEATER?

29:26.899 --> 29:28.300
- YEAH, WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.439
- DETECTIVE AMARO...

29:33.472 --> 29:36.108
FOUND YOUR CARD
IN THE VICTIM'S POCKET.

29:38.945 --> 29:41.047
- [sighs]

29:43.950 --> 29:46.018
NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LET HIM WALK.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.120
- GET CSU OVER HERE.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.221
- FOR AN O.D.?

29:49.255 --> 29:51.023
- YOU SURE THIS IS AN O.D.?

29:51.057 --> 29:52.258
'CAUSE I'M NOT.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.526
WE'RE GONNA NEED FULL WORKUP
OF THIS SCENE.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.907
- CIRCUMSTANCES UNDETERMINED?

30:07.940 --> 30:09.075
ALL THAT HEROIN IN HIS BLOOD?

30:09.108 --> 30:11.077
THE GUY'S NOT EXACTLY
AN AMATEUR.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.144
SOMEBODY GAVE HIM
A HOT SHOT.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.146
- OR HE GAVE IT TO HIMSELF.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.915
WHAT'S UNDETERMINED,
DETECTIVE,

30:15.948 --> 30:17.583
IS WHETHER IT'S A HOMICIDE
OR A SUICIDE.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.218
IT'S A CUPPI:

30:19.251 --> 30:20.987
PENDING POLICE INVESTIGATION.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.421
- COME ON, MELINDA.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.091
- SEE...THAT'S WHY
THE M.E.'s OFFICE

30:25.124 --> 30:26.425
IS SEPARATE
FROM THE POLICE.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.895
SO THEY DON'T JUMP
TO OUR CONCLUSIONS.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.898
- DON'T PLAY ME, AMARO.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.199
- NEVER.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.234
BUT LET'S JUST
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.502
IF IT WAS A SUICIDE,

30:36.535 --> 30:37.904
THEN STEVIE INJECTED HIMSELF.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.238
HE'S RIGHT-HANDED,

30:39.271 --> 30:41.440
INJECTED THE LEFT ARM.
THAT WORKS.

30:41.473 --> 30:45.211
AND IT TOOK HIM THREE,
FOUR ATTEMPTS TO HIT A VEIN?

30:45.244 --> 30:47.146
- WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
THERE'S SO MUCH BLOOD.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.049
- EXCEPT THAT STEVIE
WAS A CAREER JUNKIE.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.350
THE ONE THING
HE KNEW HOW TO DO

30:51.383 --> 30:52.551
WAS SHOOT UP.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.420
THE GUY WAS A SHARPSHOOTER.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.355
- WHICH IS WHY
I NOTED IT IN MY REPORT.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.958
- OKAY, SO SEE IF THIS
WORKS FOR YOU.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.993
SOME GUYS HELD STEVIE DOWN,

31:01.027 --> 31:02.261
THEY HAD TROUBLE
INJECTING HIM,

31:02.294 --> 31:03.329
AND THEY MADE
A MESS OF IT.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.297
- THAT'S ONE
PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO.

31:05.331 --> 31:08.100
- ESPECIALLY SINCE
HE JUST GOT INTO A FIGHT

31:08.134 --> 31:09.368
OUTSIDE A CLUB
A FEW HOURS EARLIER,

31:09.401 --> 31:12.104
WHERE THREATS WERE MADE.

31:12.138 --> 31:14.240
LOOK, MELINDA,
IT'S NOT OUR CALL.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.175
THERE'S SOMEONE
THAT WE REALLY LIKE FOR THIS.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.343
AND WE NEED CAUSE
TO BRING HIM IN.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.278
- I CAN'T GET YOU THERE.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.913
YOUR SCENARIO WORKS.

31:20.947 --> 31:21.847
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.116
YOU SAW THE BEATING
HE TOOK AT THE CLUB.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.417
HE WAS CONCUSSED.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.319
GOT WOOZY.
COULDN'T FIND A VEIN.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.921
FIELDER'S CHOICE.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.089
- SO IF IT COULD
GO BOTH WAYS,

31:30.122 --> 31:31.557
THEN GIVE US A BREAK.
- COME ON, OLIVIA.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.192
YOU KNOW BETTER.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.293
- OKAY.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.394
ALL RIGHT.
AHEM.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.997
JUST DO US ONE FAVOR.

31:38.030 --> 31:41.233
DON'T RELEASE YOUR REPORT
RIGHT AWAY.

31:41.267 --> 31:44.303
ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE BACKED UP.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.371
I'LL OWE YOU ONE.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.011
- PRINCE MILLER KNEW
STEVIE WAS GONNA TESTIFY

31:52.044 --> 31:53.579
ABOUT COACH RAY'S ABUSE,

31:53.612 --> 31:55.982
WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE
PRINCE'S OWN ABUSE PUBLIC--

31:56.015 --> 31:57.416
NOT AN IMAGE
HE WANTS TO PROJECT.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.650
- SO WHEN PRINCE COULDN'T
BACK STEVIE DOWN,

31:58.684 --> 32:00.452
HE MADE SURE
HE STAYED QUIET

32:00.486 --> 32:02.221
WITH A FATAL
HOT SHOT OF HEROIN.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.455
- MOTIVE AND OPPORTUNITY,

32:03.489 --> 32:04.690
BUT NO WITNESSES,
NO EVIDENCE.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.058
TOUGH TO PROVE.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.326
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW,
THE FUNNY THING.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.394
PRINCE COULD HAVE
DUCKED US.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.363
HE CAME IN ON HIS OWN.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.365
HEY, GUYS.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.534
HE'S NOT SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS.

32:15.567 --> 32:18.437
- LOOK, I FEEL BAD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO STEVIE,

32:18.470 --> 32:20.206
BUT IF YOU GUYS THINK
THAT I KILLED HIM,

32:20.239 --> 32:22.541
YOU MUST BE AS HIGH
AS HE WAS LAST NIGHT.

32:22.574 --> 32:23.976
- YOU WANNA TELL US
WHERE YOU WERE

32:24.010 --> 32:26.145
FROM 3:30 A.M.
TO 7:00 A.M.?

32:26.178 --> 32:27.379
- THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

32:27.413 --> 32:30.182
MR. MILLER LEFT THE CLUB
WITH TWO YOUNG LADIES,

32:30.216 --> 32:31.217
WENT DIRECTLY TO HIS HOME,

32:31.250 --> 32:33.485
WHERE THEY REMAINED
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.354
- WELL, I'M SURE THAT YOU
CAN PRODUCE THEM, MR. ARNOFF.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.688
WE'LL DECIDE
IF THEY'RE CREDIBLE.

32:36.722 --> 32:41.027
- WE CAN DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.363
PLEASE NOTE THE TIME STAMP
IN THE LEFT CORNER.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.333
THEY DID HALF THE KAMA SUTRA,
DETECTIVES,

32:47.366 --> 32:50.369
TILL PAST NOON.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.339
WE CAN WATCH THE WHOLE THING
IF YOU WANT.

32:53.372 --> 32:56.042
- TIME STAMPS CAN BE
MANIPULATED, COUNSELOR.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.676
- THE YOUNG LADIES ALSO
SIGNED A CONSENT FORM

32:57.709 --> 33:00.212
BEFORE AND AFTER
THE ENCOUNTER.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.248
YOU CAN SEE WHAT TIME
THEY LEFT.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.482
MY CLIENT IS FAST,

33:03.515 --> 33:05.384
BUT HE CANNOT BE IN TWO PLACES
AT ONE TIME.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.419
- DO YOU ALWAYS FILM
YOUR LADIES, PRINCE,

33:07.453 --> 33:09.021
OR WAS LAST NIGHT SPECIAL?

33:09.055 --> 33:11.123
- THERE'S A LOT OF FALSE
ACCUSATIONS OUT THERE,

33:11.157 --> 33:12.224
DETECTIVE.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.460
I GOT TO HAVE INSURANCE.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.564
- YOU KNOW,
ONE MORE QUESTION, PRINCE.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.300
YOU KNOW,
STEVIE SAID THAT, UH,

33:21.333 --> 33:23.635
YOU GOT IT WORSE
THAN HE DID.

33:25.404 --> 33:28.207
WHEN DID COACH RAY
STOP RAPING YOU?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.476
- YOU NEED
TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.178
'CAUSE YOU GOT NO CLUE
WHAT YOU TALKIN' ABOUT.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.312
- NO?

33:33.345 --> 33:36.548
HOW COME YOU GET SO UPSET
EVERY TIME I BRING IT UP?

33:38.384 --> 33:42.054
- NOBODY TOUCHES
PRINCE MILLER.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.189
NOBODY.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.323
- WE'RE DONE.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.824
WE CAME IN HERE
TO COOPERATE,

33:45.857 --> 33:48.427
BUT THIS IS HARASSMENT.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.230
- YEAH, YOU RIGHT.
- YEAH.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.499
- I DON'T NEED THIS.
I GOT A BRAND TO PROMOTE.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.569
[chuckling]

34:03.409 --> 34:06.212
- WELL, THAT WAS
A WHOLE LOT OF NOTHIN'.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.279
- WELL, SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HIM.

34:07.313 --> 34:08.214
THAT'S OBVIOUS.

34:08.247 --> 34:10.682
- EITHER WAY,
PRINCE IS NOT GOOD FOR IT.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.551
MAYBE STEVIE HARRIS
O.D.'d AFTER ALL.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.220
- YEAH, I DON'T SEE IT.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.222
STEVIE WAS REALLY
WORKING HIS PROGRAM.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.657
- AND PRINCE IS ALL ABOUT
PROTECTING HIS BRAND.

34:18.690 --> 34:22.128
LET'S SEE WHAT ROLLINS GOT
ON THOSE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.565
- THERE'S NOT A LOT
TO GO ON.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.335
ONLY STEVIE'S PRINTS
ARE ON THE SYRINGE.

34:29.368 --> 34:32.438
- UH, LOOK
AT THIS FOOTPRINT.

34:34.640 --> 34:35.874
WHAT IS THAT?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.509
"P" FOR PRINCE?

34:39.845 --> 34:41.580
- HIS BRAND.

34:43.482 --> 34:48.187
[siren blaring]

34:49.788 --> 34:51.523
[tires screech]

34:51.557 --> 34:54.360
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

34:54.393 --> 34:55.427
- COME ON, MAN,
THE D.W.B.?

34:55.461 --> 34:56.795
I'M TOO RICH FOR THIS.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.164
- GET OUT OF THE CAR NOW.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.500
- [sighs]

35:01.533 --> 35:03.802
- AND I'M GONNA
NEED YOUR SNEAKERS.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.304
- MY SNEAKERS?

35:05.337 --> 35:06.372
FOR WHAT?

35:06.405 --> 35:07.339
- THOSE ARE THE PROTOTYPE,
RIGHT?

35:07.373 --> 35:08.774
ONLY ONES IN EXISTENCE.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.643
- HEY, MAN, GET ON THE PHONE--
THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.479
- BETTER HOPE THERE'S NO
DEAD JUNKIE BLOOD ON 'EM.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.381
COME ON.
GET OUT OF 'EM.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.353
- DON'T SCUFF 'EM UP.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.490
- GET IN THE CAR.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.796
- YOU WERE TELLING THE TRUTH.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.299
IT WASN'T YOU.
IT WAS SUPREME.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.733
- SUPREME WOULDN'T KILL
STEVIE, EITHER.

35:34.766 --> 35:35.734
THAT'S CRAZY.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.370
- WOULDN'T HE?

35:38.404 --> 35:40.372
SUPREME AND COACH
ARE THE SAME.

35:40.406 --> 35:45.244
COACH RAN YOU FOR TEN YEARS,
AND NOW IT'S SUPREME'S TURN.

35:45.277 --> 35:48.247
NEITHER ONE OF THEM EVER
LOOKED OUT FOR YOU, PRINCE.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.849
THEY WERE LOOKING OUT
FOR THEMSELVES.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.387
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.794
- SUPREME'S SHOES
WERE A MATCH

36:02.828 --> 36:04.363
FOR THE FOOTPRINTS
AT THE SCENE

36:04.396 --> 36:05.797
WITH TRACES
OF STEVIE'S BLOOD

36:05.831 --> 36:07.399
ON THE TREADS
AND ON THE SIDE.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.234
- THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
FOR HIS LAWYERS

36:08.267 --> 36:09.335
TO START PLAYING
"LET'S MAKE A DEAL."

36:09.368 --> 36:12.304
- YEAH, BUT THAT STILL
LEAVES COACH RAY OUT THERE,

36:12.338 --> 36:13.505
AND WITHOUT STEVIE
TO TESTIFY.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.341
- WE GO BACK TO PRINCE.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.942
- AH, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.511
- WE CAN COMPEL HIM
IF WE EMPANEL A GRAND JURY.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.780
WE'RE NOT ASKING HIM
TO INCRIMINATE HIMSELF--

36:21.813 --> 36:22.848
JUST COACH RAY.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.416
- BUT FORCING HIM
TO TESTIFY

36:24.450 --> 36:25.684
UNDER THREAT OF CONTEMPT?

36:25.717 --> 36:27.419
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
TO GET HIM.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.186
- I'M TRYING
TO RESURRECT YOUR CASE,

36:28.220 --> 36:30.489
AND YOU DON'T LIKE
MY TACTICS?

36:30.522 --> 36:31.623
THAT COACH IS STILL OUT THERE,
RIGHT NOW,

36:31.657 --> 36:33.292
DOING THIS TO OTHER KIDS.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.761
- PRINCE PUT UP A WALL
WHEN HE WAS 14 YEARS OLD.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.563
HE'S LIED TO US
HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.565
WHAT MAKES HIM
TELL THE TRUTH NOW?

36:39.598 --> 36:41.567
- MAYBE WE NEED
TO REMIND HIM

36:41.600 --> 36:44.470
WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE
BEFORE THE WALL WENT UP.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.946
- I THOUGHT WE WERE
HEADED DOWNTOWN.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.917
- UH, JUST WANTED
TO MAKE A QUICK STOP.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.586
- IT'S THE SUMMER LEAGUE,
PRINCE.

37:00.619 --> 37:01.920
JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO SEE

37:01.953 --> 37:03.955
HOW THE FUTURE STARS
OF YOUR SPORT ARE DOING.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.391
COME ON.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.460
- PRINCE MILLER!

37:08.494 --> 37:11.297
HEY! IT'S PRINCE.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.266
HEY!

37:14.300 --> 37:15.301
- YO, WHAT'S UP, KID?

37:15.334 --> 37:16.302
WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?

37:16.335 --> 37:17.403
- SHAUN.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.505
AIN'T NO BIGGER FAN
THAN ME, PRINCE.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.307
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.408
[whistle blows]

37:22.441 --> 37:23.909
- COME ON, BOYS.
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.312
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

37:26.345 --> 37:28.914
- COME ON, WE PRACTICE HARD.
WE PLAY HARD.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.449
COME ON, BREAK IT UP, BOYS.
BREAK IT UP.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.418
LET'S GO.
- EXCUSE ME.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.491
- PRINCE.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.660
BEEN TOO LONG.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.495
- COACH.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.664
- YOU KNOW, I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS,

37:45.697 --> 37:47.433
BUT OF ALL MY PLAYERS,

37:47.466 --> 37:49.401
YOU WERE ALWAYS
MY FAVORITE.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.875
DETECTIVE.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.910
COME ON, DEVON. LET'S GO.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.712
CUT OFF THAT
BASELINE PASS, HUH?

38:00.746 --> 38:01.780
COME ON.

38:03.949 --> 38:07.519
LET'S GO!
LET'S GET THOSE HANDS UP!

38:07.553 --> 38:10.055
- SO IMPRESSIONABLE
AT THAT AGE.

38:10.088 --> 38:12.391
- KID'S GOT IT.
SMOOTH AS SILK.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.793
HE'S A NATURAL LEADER
OUT THERE.

38:14.826 --> 38:17.863
- I BET YOU SEE A LITTLE
OF YOURSELF IN DEVON.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.599
ALL THE TALENT
IN THE WORLD AND...

38:20.632 --> 38:23.034
A COACH WHO CAN SHOW HIM
ALL THE RIGHT MOVES.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.974
YOU KNOW WHERE ROACH RAY
IS GOING ON FRIDAY?

38:29.007 --> 38:30.609
HE'S GOING TO A TOURNAMENT
IN CALIFORNIA

38:30.642 --> 38:33.445
WITH DEVON
AND ALL THE BARONS.

38:33.479 --> 38:36.982
YOU REMEMBER THOSE, RIGHT?

38:37.015 --> 38:39.618
HE'S GONNA BE DOING
BED CHECKS AND EVERYTHING.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.896
- PRINCE JAMAL MILLER.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.998
DO YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE TRUTH,

38:53.031 --> 38:54.500
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,

38:54.533 --> 38:56.435
SO HELP YOU GOD?

39:00.071 --> 39:02.073
[camera shutters clicking]

39:15.120 --> 39:16.988
- [sighs]

39:22.794 --> 39:25.664
AS PLAYERS, WE PUT
OUR TRUST IN COACHES

39:25.697 --> 39:27.399
AT A VERY EARLY AGE.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.471
THEY TEACH US THE GAME...

39:32.504 --> 39:36.608
AND THEY HELP US
THROUGH SCHOOL.

39:36.642 --> 39:38.744
THEY GIVE US ADVICE ON LIFE.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.479
SOMETIMES, THEY EVEN
HOLD OUR DREAMS

39:40.512 --> 39:43.882
IN THEIR HANDS.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.717
ONE COACH
BETRAYED THAT TRUST.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.155
TODAY, I MADE
AN IMPORTANT DECISION.

39:50.188 --> 39:54.860
I TOLD THE GRAND JURY
THE TRUTH ABOUT RAY MASTERS.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.763
HOW HE...

39:57.796 --> 39:59.431
RECRUITED ME
FOR THE BABY BARONS,

39:59.465 --> 40:00.632
HIS SUMMER LEAGUE TEAM,

40:00.666 --> 40:02.434
WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD.

40:06.772 --> 40:11.443
AND HOW HE STARTED
SEXUALLY ABUSING ME...

40:11.477 --> 40:13.812
ON OUR FIRST ROAD TRIP,

40:13.845 --> 40:16.081
AND CONTINUED
UNTIL I WAS 15.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.522
WHY DIDN'T I
COME FORWARD THEN?

40:23.555 --> 40:26.858
BECAUSE I WAS
JUST A LITTLE KID.

40:26.892 --> 40:30.161
AND I WAS CONFUSED.

40:30.195 --> 40:33.965
AND ASHAMED.

40:33.999 --> 40:39.538
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE
MY CHANCES AT BASKETBALL.

40:39.571 --> 40:42.207
AND I'M SORRY
THAT I KEPT MY SECRET

40:42.240 --> 40:45.811
LOCKED UP FOR SO LONG.

40:45.844 --> 40:49.548
BECAUSE MANY OTHERS MAY HAVE
BEEN VICTIMIZED AFTER ME.

40:49.581 --> 40:50.215
- WHAT'S WRONG?

40:54.586 --> 41:00.826
- [crying] I HOPE
THAT THEY COME FORWARD...

41:00.859 --> 41:03.962
AND TELL THEIR STORIES TOO.

41:03.995 --> 41:09.267
BECAUSE I KNOW
THEY'RE HURTING.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.469
BUT TRUTH CAN BE
THE BEST MEDICINE.

41:16.575 --> 41:19.578
WHAT WE ALL
HAVE TO REMEMBER IS,

41:19.611 --> 41:24.015
THE SHAME IS NOT OURS.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.618
IT'S HIS.

41:41.299 --> 41:45.503
