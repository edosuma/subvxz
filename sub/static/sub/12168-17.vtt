00:01.043 --> 00:02.920
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

00:02.961 --> 00:07.257
We had hoped to test our first
atomic weapon five years from now.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.967
- Do we have that much time, Sheppard?
- No

00:09.009 --> 00:12.471
<i>You do realize that long-term exposure</i>
<i>to these levels of radiation is extremely dangerous?</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.973
Our scientists tell me otherwise.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.935
<i>- How many of these ships do you have?</i>
<i>- Just the one.</i>

00:21.271 --> 00:22.940
<i>Commander Augustus Kolya.</i>

00:22.981 --> 00:24.816
We are in control of Atlantis.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.945
Sheppard has just disabled another generator.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.780
Yes, Ladon, I'm aware of that!

00:29.821 --> 00:32.115
<i>Reinforcements are arriving now, commander.</i>

00:33.992 --> 00:36.870
<i>We already have serious flooding</i>
<i>in the north and west piers.</i>

00:36.912 --> 00:39.873
Oh, it's no use! The City conduits just
can't handle this kind of raw power.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.875
I think I know where we can get another nuke.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.628
Major, I don't know how sympathetic
the Genii will be to our situation.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.548
You heard our message.
The Wraith are at our doorstep.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.884
We have an opportunity for you to test your weapon.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.804
<i>This is Weir.</i>

00:54.012 --> 00:55.472
I've got the prototypes.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.354
<i>How much further?</i>

01:02.396 --> 01:04.397
Just around this next corner.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.900
When was the last time you had any contact with them?

01:06.942 --> 01:09.653
They came under fire about half an hour ago.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.948
The major told me to head
to the Gate and radio for backup.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.408
I haven't heard from them since.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.743
They were under fire
and you didn't head back to help?

01:16.952 --> 01:19.454
Major Lorne told me to stay by the Gate.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.706
You did the right thing.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.171
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:29.047 --> 01:30.716
Is that the building you were in?

01:31.341 --> 01:33.844
Shouldn't there be villagers?
Why aren't they trying to put out the fire?

01:33.886 --> 01:36.096
The fire's out. That's just steam and smoke.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.390
Let's take a look. You stay here with Lindsay.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.683
Right. Sure.

01:39.725 --> 01:44.479
Oh, and hey, if you hear gunfire, just know that
that's me holding back our attackers all on my own?

<i>A fire like this would have burned the whole</i>
<i>village if someone had not dealt with it.</i>

02:17.679 --> 02:20.766
<i>Somebody put it out. They just didn't</i>
<i>want to stick around and talk about it.</i>

02:23.477 --> 02:25.312
It's not safe to be up here.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.605
Thanks for that.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.828
I got something.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.176
Damn it.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.678
<i>What?</i>

03:03.100 --> 03:04.351
Dog tags.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.982
These are Lorne's.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.665
What the hell happened out there?

03:26.707 --> 03:32.087
As you know, Lorne and his team have
the weekly detail of escorting Dr. Lindsay to 177.

03:32.129 --> 03:35.841
Yes, the one who's educating the people
on more effective agricultural and fishing methods.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.092
Yeah, that's right.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.012
Things were going along smoothly
until our guys were attacked.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.263
Just like that, out of the blue?

03:41.305 --> 03:42.514
It seems that way.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.224
By who, the villagers?

03:44.266 --> 03:45.225
I don't know.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.979
Lindsay's not a real useful source of
information right now. She's a little shook up.

03:49.021 --> 03:52.733
Beckett gave her a sedative.
Hopefully she'll be able to give us more info later.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.776
Unscheduled offworld activation.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.577
What have you got?

04:03.619 --> 04:07.706
No IDC, but we are receiving a pretty
weak transmission on the VHF band.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.999
Audio and video.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.250
Let's see it.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.213
Atlantis base, this is Ladon Radim.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.048
<i>Are you receiving transmission?</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:17.341
He's one of Kolya's men.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.635
Yeah, I know who he is. We can't answer this, though.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.971
I need the Genii, of all people,
to believe that Atlantis has been destroyed.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.306
Well, I know we got the word out.

04:24.348 --> 04:30.646
My men have witnessed your teams dialing and returning
through the Stargate to Atlantis more than once.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.484
Now, from that, I can deduce that the rumors
of your City's demise are greatly exaggerated.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.195
- Sneaky. I'll give them that.
<i>- Your secret is safe,</i>

04:38.612 --> 04:40.906
as long as you respond to this transmission.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.617
Open a channel.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.662
<i>Atlantis base, this is Ladon Radim.</i>

04:46.703 --> 04:48.622
We hear you. This is Weir.

04:49.665 --> 04:50.874
Dr. Weir...

04:51.542 --> 04:54.461
I was beginning to fear the rumors
of your destruction were true.

04:54.503 --> 04:55.671
What do you want?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.172
I have something to trade.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.466
<i>Don't think I don't recognize you, Ladon.</i>

04:59.508 --> 05:01.552
You're a member of Kolya's strike force.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.471
You tried to forcibly take this City from us.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.765
<i>Why would we want to do business with you?</i>

05:06.807 --> 05:09.268
Because I have defected from the Genii.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.144
Well, good luck with that.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.941
And I have a Zero Point Module.

05:20.946 --> 05:25.951
And I have a tentative truce with the Genii
that I'm not very eager to jeopardize.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.036
The Genii got what they wanted.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.330
They want no more from you...

05:31.373 --> 05:33.041
and this is of no use to me...

05:34.293 --> 05:37.838
But I know how important these devices
are to your continued survival.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.923
<i>Now, we can discuss this in person.</i>

05:40.174 --> 05:43.468
<i>Lower your shields and allow me</i>
<i>safe passage into the City.</i>

05:45.345 --> 05:47.014
We're not interested, Ladon.

05:49.516 --> 05:54.104
This is far, far better than the last trade
you made with the Genii, Doctor,

05:54.146 --> 05:55.564
<i>and you know it.</i>

05:55.981 --> 05:59.109
<i>I'm transmitting the Gate address to the planet I'm on.</i>

05:59.151 --> 06:01.612
You can send a team to search me if you wish,

06:01.653 --> 06:03.697
but I am unarmed and alone.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.574
<i>I'll be here for two hours.</i>

06:05.991 --> 06:11.205
If I don't hear from you within that time,
this Zero Point Module will be lost to you forever.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.333
The choice is yours.

A ZedPM is a ZedPM.
Who cares where it comes from?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.868
<i>- We've already got one.</i>
- Yes, one.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.495
- Two is better than one.
<i>- And three is better than two. Look,</i>

07:33.537 --> 07:36.456
we all know that eventually the Wraith
are going to discover we're still here.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.001
Having more power means that we have more options.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.712
We might even be able to light up
the engines and get the City to fly.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.631
Really?

07:45.048 --> 07:46.717
No...
but we still need it.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.219
Well, flying City or not,

07:49.261 --> 07:51.096
I think we should consider this.

07:51.513 --> 07:55.851
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you the one
the Genii threatened to kill on two separate occasions?

07:55.893 --> 07:57.853
He says he's alone,
and he's willing to be searched.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.564
Wait a minute.
We should be dealing with Lorne and his team,

08:00.606 --> 08:02.774
<i>find out what happened to them.</i>

08:05.068 --> 08:07.779
Teyla and Ronon will continue with that investigation,

08:07.821 --> 08:10.282
and you can join them once you finish up with this.

08:13.202 --> 08:16.747
Alright, get a MALP ready with the lifesigns detector.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.875
I'm not sending my team in there blind.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.506
We're getting telemetry back from the MALP.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.174
Only reading one lifesign.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.885
- Then so far he's telling the truth.
- So far.

08:34.056 --> 08:38.434
As I'm sure your machine has already
determined, I am unarmed and alone.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.355
You can go ahead and send your team to search me.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.192
Go ahead.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.151
Yes, Sir.

08:52.616 --> 08:55.327
They're peaceful people. They really are.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.247
I just can't imagine the villagers
doing something like this.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.498
Tell us what happened.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.252
We were invited into one
of the villager's homes for tea,

09:03.293 --> 09:06.380
a welcoming custom we've been
through a dozen or so times.

09:06.421 --> 09:10.551
Dira, one of the villagers,
asked for a word with me in private.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.053
- She took me downstairs...
- You went alone with her?

09:13.679 --> 09:15.764
They're farmers and fishermen.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.182
I've been dealing with them for months.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.268
- I trusted them.
- Yeah, that was a mistake.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.143
Ronon...

09:23.689 --> 09:24.523
Go on.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.278
Once I was downstairs, I heard the first shots.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.196
- They sounded like Wraith blasts...
- Wraith?

09:31.822 --> 09:35.367
I can't be sure, but, yes,
that's what it sounded like.

09:35.993 --> 09:39.538
<i>Major Lorne radioed me from upstairs</i>
<i>and told me to go to the Gate and</i>

09:39.955 --> 09:40.998
call for backup.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.960
The rest you know.

09:45.586 --> 09:48.088
Did this, Dira try to stop you?

09:48.922 --> 09:49.756
No.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.467
Did she look surprised when she heard the shots?

09:53.719 --> 09:54.928
I don't remember.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.722
Can you think of any reason,

09:56.763 --> 10:01.018
any reason at all, that the people of this village
would want to attack Lorne and his men?

10:02.477 --> 10:03.312
No.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.363
He's clean, Sir.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.451
What, no ZPM?

10:17.701 --> 10:21.663
I sent it to another planet for safekeeping.
How stupid do you think I am?

10:22.289 --> 10:26.251
From what I remember, I gave you a pretty
good crack on the head last time we met.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.545
I guess I was kind of hoping it made you simple.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.172
No, it didn't,

10:30.214 --> 10:32.508
but ever since then,
I've been plagued with headaches.

10:32.925 --> 10:35.177
You're just saying that to be nice.

10:35.219 --> 10:36.470
What do you want for it?

10:36.512 --> 10:38.138
I'll only talk with Weir.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.973
Do I make you nervous?

10:40.015 --> 10:41.683
Not at all, Major.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.811
I'm just not interested in talking to the errand boy.

10:46.813 --> 10:50.025
That's lieutenant colonel errand boy to you.

11:08.794 --> 11:09.837
It's not them.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.339
What do you mean?

11:12.381 --> 11:14.842
These bodies you found are not Lorne and his men.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.178
But they were wearing their dog tags.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.806
I don't know what to tell you.
I've run the DNA test three times now.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.183
- Then Lorne and his men could still be alive?
- Aye.

11:23.225 --> 11:26.019
Dr. Lindsay heard Wraith stunners
before the fire broke out.

11:26.061 --> 11:30.566
- But this wasn't a Wraith attack, so...
- So whoever it was wanted us to think they were dead.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.733
But who?

11:31.942 --> 11:33.986
What could they possibly want with Lorne?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.279
We need to go back,

11:35.487 --> 11:36.738
question the villagers.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.658
Okay,
but regular radio contact, please.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.995
<i>Dr. Weir, we have Ladon.</i>

11:43.412 --> 11:44.454
What has he said?

11:44.872 --> 11:45.706
<i>Not much.</i>

11:45.747 --> 11:47.165
<i>Apparently he doesn't like me.</i>

11:47.207 --> 11:48.834
Okay, take him to my office.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.919
<i>Your office? Really?</i>

11:51.336 --> 11:53.213
Really, Colonel. I'm on my way.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.758
You two be careful.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.603
Dr. Weir, thank you for your warm...

12:07.811 --> 12:09.479
What do you want for the ZPM?

12:10.105 --> 12:12.024
You people aren't much for small talk, are you?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.817
Not with criminals, no.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.570
As a member of Kolya's strike team,
I was following orders.

12:16.612 --> 12:19.072
I harbor no ill will towards you or your people.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.115
That's nice.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.201
It's the truth.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.703
What do you want for it?

12:26.371 --> 12:31.126
I need about a hundred machine guns, a couple
dozen grenades, and any C4 that you have to spare.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.836
Sounds like you're having a party.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.798
Explain... how is turning you into
a threat in our best interest?

12:36.840 --> 12:38.467
The real threat are the Genii.

12:38.884 --> 12:42.429
Their nuclear weapons are fully operational,
and it's my considered belief

12:42.471 --> 12:46.183
that they will soon begin using them
as a first-strike offensive weapon,

12:46.225 --> 12:49.311
not just against the Wraith,
but human populations as well.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.772
Now, you give me and my men the arms we need,

12:51.813 --> 12:54.107
you'll never have to worry about the Genii again.

12:54.525 --> 12:55.734
You're planning a coup.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.278
Yes, and you're going to help me.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.375
<i>Cowen has led our people for too long.</i>

13:11.416 --> 13:14.336
Yes, it's true he's made the Genii
a force to be reckoned with,

13:14.378 --> 13:17.881
but the Cowen of the past bears little
resemblance to the Cowen who's in power now.

13:17.923 --> 13:18.882
How so?

13:18.924 --> 13:22.344
He's become obsessed with uniting
the galaxy under a single ruler.

13:22.386 --> 13:23.929
And that would be him?

13:24.137 --> 13:27.015
He thinks it's the only chance
we have at defeating the Wraith.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.560
Whether the galaxy likes it or not.

13:30.185 --> 13:34.106
Commander Kolya was the only Genii who could
stand up to him, keep him under control.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.024
He went missing several months ago.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.361
We suspect Cowen had him murdered.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.446
But you can't prove it?

13:42.281 --> 13:43.323
Not yet.

13:43.532 --> 13:45.826
And in Kolya's absence...

13:45.868 --> 13:47.911
Our people were looking for leadership.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.371
They looked to me.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.665
Get to the part where you find the ZPM.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.793
Kolya often spoke
about the Brotherhood of the Fifteen.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.545
The last mission you encountered him, no?

13:56.587 --> 13:59.173
The last time he tried to kill me, yes.

14:00.424 --> 14:04.178
Finding resources for the resistance
has been next to impossible.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.723
We have a few rifles, limited ammunition,

14:07.764 --> 14:10.017
nowhere near enough to stage a rebellion.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.311
So you thought if you found a ZPM,

14:12.352 --> 14:13.979
we would give you everything you needed.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.899
<i>It's very hard to find trading partners</i>
<i>who don't fear the Genii.</i>

14:17.107 --> 14:19.193
Cowen has spies all over the galaxy.

14:19.610 --> 14:22.738
I figured you'd be more than willing to help
if we could give you something of value.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.240
How do we know
you'll be any better than Cowen?

14:25.449 --> 14:27.951
Look, I know you don't trust me...

14:28.577 --> 14:32.331
but if Cowen uses his new atomic
weapons to enslave other worlds,

14:32.372 --> 14:34.625
then the Genii are no better than the Wraith,

14:35.042 --> 14:37.127
and you can have your ZPM,

14:37.544 --> 14:39.838
but you must help me stop that from happening.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.848
Never heard of her.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.517
Are you certain?

14:51.558 --> 14:52.309
Dira.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.853
She was friends with the men
who were killed last night.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.606
I said I never heard of her.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.904
This is a small community, friend.
Surely you know her.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.323
She lived in the house that burned down.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.867
We would just like
to ask her some questions.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.495
I just tend to my bar

15:11.537 --> 15:12.579
and my family.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.208
I mind my business,
and I suggest you do the same.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.880
We want to know why our friends were killed.

15:21.922 --> 15:22.840
Ronon...

15:23.632 --> 15:24.758
He knows something.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.552
Everyone here knows something.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.554
Let him go.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.227
Who are you trying to protect?

15:35.477 --> 15:39.565
If you knew what's best for you,
you'll both go back from where you came.

15:46.655 --> 15:47.906
They're watching us.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.118
They'll kill us all if you're not careful.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.078
Who?

15:56.331 --> 15:59.251
We can protect you, help you fight them.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.378
No, you can't.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.173
Leave me be.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.112
Do you believe him?

16:29.198 --> 16:30.866
Well, he has a ZPM.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.534
No, I mean about the other stuff.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.244
Evil Cowen.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.373
He's lying about something.

16:40.042 --> 16:44.796
When Cowen handed over two of his atomic
weapons to us, it was a sort of olive branch,

16:44.838 --> 16:47.508
and I would hate to jeopardize what
little momentum we have going with them.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.676
- Stick with the devil we know.
- Exactly.

16:51.637 --> 16:52.930
So we give them the heads-up?

16:52.971 --> 16:54.890
Tell the Genii he's planning something?

16:55.849 --> 16:56.683
I think so.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.936
I'll tell Ladon that

16:58.977 --> 17:01.688
we need a bit more time and
to set up a way to contact him.

17:01.730 --> 17:05.025
I left one of our best special ops
guys on the planet when we searched him.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.152
If Ladon goes anywhere, my guy will find him.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.069
Good thinking.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.780
Could have been Mensa.

17:19.498 --> 17:23.585
I hope Beckett found some sort of clue,
because this was a giant waste of time.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.087
<i>Excuse me!</i>

17:26.463 --> 17:26.964
You...

17:27.339 --> 17:28.632
You left this behind.

17:28.966 --> 17:29.842
It's not ours.

17:31.552 --> 17:32.511
Yes, it is.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.223
Of course.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.016
How foolish of me.

17:38.141 --> 17:38.976
Thank you.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.604
What's inside?

17:42.938 --> 17:43.689
Not here.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.990
<i>You know, I'm not sure that you've</i>
<i>sufficiently trained me in actual combat.</i>

17:53.031 --> 17:54.533
<i>I don't know how much use I'd be in a...</i>

17:54.575 --> 17:58.954
<i>- fight-our-way-out kind of scenario.</i>
<i>- Well, I look at it this way...</i>

17:58.996 --> 18:04.084
<i>The Genii have tried to kidnap you on numerous</i>
<i>occasions to mine that big old brain of yours.</i>

18:04.126 --> 18:04.710
<i>Yes?</i>

18:04.751 --> 18:08.130
Well, if we get into trouble, I'll
just trade your life for mine.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.506
Oh. Funny.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.049
Don't worry.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.635
If you survive,
I'll mount some sort of rescue mission.

18:13.677 --> 18:14.469
Eventually.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.431
Dr. McKay.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.310
Oh, and it's
lieutenant colonel Sheppard now, I hear.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.312
Somebody's been paying attention.

18:25.189 --> 18:29.318
I'm afraid I don't have much time, but,
please, tell me, what I can do for you?

18:29.484 --> 18:35.073
We were just checking in, saying hi, since we really
haven't been in contact since the last culling.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.367
We barely survived the last culling.

18:37.409 --> 18:41.413
<i>I can't help but think how close</i>
<i>to extinction we came as a people.</i>

18:42.122 --> 18:46.251
Our former ambitions have been
tempered by the real world, I'm afraid.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.714
We've been busy trying to fulfill
our people's most basic needs.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.717
You know, we could help with that.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.429
You know, with supplies, even manpower.

18:57.471 --> 18:59.097
And why would you do that?

18:59.139 --> 19:02.809
Well, we probably wouldn't be here if it
wasn't for the nukes you gave us, so...

19:03.519 --> 19:04.436
We owe you one.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.814
We are a proud people, Sheppard,

19:07.856 --> 19:10.734
but we do know
how to accept help when we need it.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.361
On that note,

19:13.529 --> 19:17.741
we've been contacted by a Genii named Ladon.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.037
At last, the real reason why you're here.

19:22.621 --> 19:23.914
What has he been saying?

19:23.956 --> 19:25.999
Oh, it was something about,

19:26.041 --> 19:29.962
conquests of other worlds using your atomic weapons.

19:30.337 --> 19:34.383
He's been telling the Manarians that I've
been slaughtering our own people for food.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.596
Ladon blames me for Kolya's disappearance,

19:39.763 --> 19:44.434
<i>and while, yes, it's true I</i>
<i>neither respected nor liked the man,</i>

19:44.476 --> 19:47.312
I had nothing to do with his presumed demise.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.315
Anything he tells you is a lie.

19:50.691 --> 19:52.484
He's trying to mount a rebellion.

19:52.693 --> 19:53.986
Let him try.

19:54.653 --> 19:58.949
He commands a couple of dozen men
and has no weapons to speak of.

19:58.991 --> 20:02.870
Believe me, the city's plumbing is
of more concern to me right now.

20:04.079 --> 20:06.999
But still, you didn't have to tell me.

20:08.292 --> 20:11.086
Apprising me of Ladon's plans was the act of a friend.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.756
Well, if you... want to contact
us, we have a new number.

20:14.840 --> 20:19.303
I've known for some time that Atlantis
survived the Wraith attack, Colonel Sheppard.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.306
<i>I hope you'll accept it as an act of good faith</i>

20:22.347 --> 20:24.516
that your secret is safe with the Genii.

20:30.856 --> 20:32.816
My men will see you to the Gate.

20:37.988 --> 20:39.615
That was refreshing.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.909
He didn't try to kill us even once.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.377
<i>My special ops guys followed Ladon to M6R-867.</i>

20:52.419 --> 20:55.464
Looks like he's occupied a warehouse
in a bombed-out, abandoned city.

20:55.506 --> 20:58.050
It was most likely destroyed by
the Wraith and never reinhabited.

20:58.091 --> 21:01.970
We did a quick fly-over in a cloaked Jumper and sure
enough, there are about 20 lifesigns in the building.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.680
20 lifesigns on the whole planet, actually.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.265
So Cowen's intel was accurate.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.808
Yeah, it appears that way, yes.

21:07.601 --> 21:11.438
- Even if these men
are highly trained and armed to the teeth...
- Which, most probably, they are not.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.398
they're no match for our guys.

21:13.815 --> 21:14.691
A raid?

21:14.733 --> 21:15.776
Oh yes, a raid.

21:15.817 --> 21:19.279
If this is their main base of operations,
I'm willing to bet the ZPM is there.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.531
And, what, just steal it?

21:20.572 --> 21:24.409
Well, the brotherhood stole it from us.
Ladon stole it from the brotherhood.
It's not really stealing. It's...

21:24.451 --> 21:25.369
Recovery.

21:25.702 --> 21:29.998
Look, we tell Ladon we're ready to do
business, he needs to send a dozen
guys here to help carry back supplies.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.083
Along with the ZedPM.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.584
He won't do that, but sure, we can ask.

21:32.626 --> 21:37.214
When they get here, we detain them,
leaving eight men in the building for
two small strike teams to deal with.

21:38.841 --> 21:40.634
Okay, it's worth the risk.

21:40.676 --> 21:41.969
Go get us a ZPM.

21:59.236 --> 22:00.028
What is it?

22:00.863 --> 22:01.780
I do not know.

22:02.823 --> 22:06.326
<i>These are pictures of some of the</i>
<i>Atlantis offworld team members.</i>

22:12.541 --> 22:14.251
- There.
<i>- Major Lorne.</i>

22:14.668 --> 22:16.461
Why would the villagers have these?

22:18.255 --> 22:20.924
The writing on the side here is in a
bunch of different languages,

22:21.216 --> 22:23.677
offering a great reward for their capture.

22:23.719 --> 22:26.054
I bet they've been circulated to dozens of planets.

22:27.848 --> 22:29.558
I hope you are wrong.

22:43.197 --> 22:44.698
<i>Offworld activation!</i>

22:52.206 --> 22:53.248
Everybody, relax.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.876
We don't want to tip them
before they're all in position.

23:11.642 --> 23:12.851
Dr. Weir?

23:13.060 --> 23:13.727
That's right.

23:13.769 --> 23:15.604
<i>I am Dahlia Radim.</i>

23:15.938 --> 23:16.772
Radim?

23:16.813 --> 23:19.149
Yes, I am Ladon's sister.

23:19.191 --> 23:20.526
Where are our supplies?

23:22.110 --> 23:23.654
Where is our ZPM?

23:24.154 --> 23:27.491
Ladon will send it through once
we have returned to our world safely.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.243
I thought you might say that.

23:32.037 --> 23:32.955
What's going on?

23:32.996 --> 23:35.207
I'm sorry, but you're being temporarily detained.

23:35.249 --> 23:36.333
Colonel?

23:36.375 --> 23:37.167
Go ahead.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.502
<i>You have a go.</i>

23:38.544 --> 23:39.378
Understood.

23:39.962 --> 23:45.551
All right, use non lethal force wherever possible, so
the men with stunners, take the point. That being said,

23:45.592 --> 23:48.595
if they engage us, do what you need to do.

24:25.966 --> 24:26.800
Clear!

24:27.050 --> 24:30.179
Start doing a room sweep.
You three with me. We're finding Ladon.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.014
Did you see me almost stun that guy?

24:32.264 --> 24:33.682
I must have missed it.

24:33.724 --> 24:36.059
Yeah, but if he was, like a step to the right,
I would have stunned him for sure.

24:36.101 --> 24:36.727
Good for you.

24:37.311 --> 24:38.937
It's... this way.

24:46.153 --> 24:47.237
How did it go?

24:47.279 --> 24:48.363
What did we miss?

24:48.405 --> 24:49.740
We have some guests.

24:49.781 --> 24:50.908
Yeah, I can see that.

24:50.949 --> 24:53.076
Dr. Weir, there is something you need to see.

24:53.327 --> 24:54.536
Let's go to my office.

24:55.704 --> 24:57.539
<i>- What's all this?</i>
<i>- It's a wanted list.</i>

24:57.706 --> 25:01.210
We figure it's on as many worlds as
there are languages on the photos.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.004
Who would do that?

25:04.046 --> 25:08.383
We are not sure, but the planet where
Lorne's team disappeared is quite poor.

25:08.425 --> 25:12.596
It is conceivable they gave up Lorne
and his men for some sort of reward.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.389
To who?

25:14.431 --> 25:16.099
And why aren't we on it?

25:16.225 --> 25:17.267
Excuse me?

25:18.018 --> 25:18.810
Sheppard's on the list.

25:18.852 --> 25:20.562
McKay is on the list.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.189
Why aren't Teyla and me?

25:22.231 --> 25:23.649
What, you're feeling left out?

25:23.690 --> 25:27.402
I just want to know who thinks I'm not a threat
and give them a chance to change their mind.

25:30.822 --> 25:32.658
The gene. They all have the gene.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.952
- The gene of the Ancestors?
- Yes.

25:34.993 --> 25:37.913
Naturally or not, all these
men possess the A.T.A. Gene.

25:37.955 --> 25:42.876
But why would someone want people simply
because they possess a certain kind of gene?

25:43.085 --> 25:46.296
Maybe they think
it will hurt our ability to operate the City.

25:46.338 --> 25:48.632
But Ronon, that's why you're not here.

25:48.799 --> 25:53.136
See, most of Edison's team is
on the list, except Toriel.

25:53.387 --> 25:56.181
He's the only one on that team
that doesn't have the gene.

25:56.306 --> 25:57.891
It still doesn't make any sense.

25:58.851 --> 26:01.687
I suggest you call these men
back if they are offworld.

26:01.728 --> 26:02.646
Yes.

26:02.896 --> 26:06.775
Most of these guys are on
an operation with Sheppard right now.

26:08.652 --> 26:12.447
We are raiding Ladon's warehouse
and stealing back the ZPM.

26:12.489 --> 26:15.993
<i>We detained most of his team when they came</i>
<i>here to pick up the weapons we offered them.</i>

26:16.034 --> 26:17.578
Once Sheppard and the team get back,

26:17.619 --> 26:21.415
I will suspend all of their offworld activity
until we can get to the bottom of this.

26:22.082 --> 26:24.376
<i>Dr. Weir, please report to the infirmary.</i>

26:25.252 --> 26:26.503
On my way, Carson.

26:27.004 --> 26:29.923
This is probably about the bodies.
You two should come along.

26:50.027 --> 26:50.861
One tango.

26:51.195 --> 26:52.446
Middle of the room.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.576
What? Isn't that right?

27:23.018 --> 27:24.228
<i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

27:25.020 --> 27:26.563
What a surprise.

27:27.397 --> 27:28.232
Drop it.

27:30.025 --> 27:30.901
Alright.

27:32.236 --> 27:33.237
Feel safer?

27:33.529 --> 27:34.404
A little bit.

27:35.614 --> 27:36.657
Is that it?

27:37.658 --> 27:38.617
It is.

27:38.784 --> 27:40.244
Slide it over.

27:47.292 --> 27:48.794
It could be booby-trapped to blow up in your face.

27:48.836 --> 27:50.045
<i>Relax, Sheppard.</i>

27:50.087 --> 27:52.089
I have no interest in killing you.

28:06.395 --> 28:07.855
It's all yours.

28:08.105 --> 28:09.314
One ZPM.

28:18.824 --> 28:22.035
One that's probably been out
of power for a thousand years.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.750
Oh, that's gas.

28:34.798 --> 28:37.217
Don't worry. It's not going to kill you either.

28:40.429 --> 28:41.930
I think I know who's behind this.

28:41.972 --> 28:42.598
Okay.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.309
Whoever these bodies belong to,
they didn't die in that fire.

28:45.434 --> 28:46.768
They died before they were burned?

28:46.810 --> 28:49.897
Aye, mostly from internal bleeding
and the breakdown of the bone marrow.

28:50.147 --> 28:51.190
What does that mean?

28:51.481 --> 28:55.277
That means they probably died
of severe radiation poisoning.

28:55.444 --> 28:56.653
Now, from what I know,

28:56.695 --> 28:58.197
there's only one race of people

28:58.238 --> 29:01.575
that could possibly be exposed to the amount of
radiation that would cause this kind of damage.

29:01.617 --> 29:03.827
- The Genii.
- Aye, exactly.

29:03.869 --> 29:05.454
If the Genii are behind this...

29:05.495 --> 29:07.372
We need to call back Sheppard's team.

29:16.882 --> 29:17.925
How do you feel?

29:21.053 --> 29:22.888
Like I've been gassed.

29:24.681 --> 29:26.934
How come it didn't affect you?

29:26.975 --> 29:29.520
I was injected with what I just gave you.

29:32.689 --> 29:33.815
Where are my men?

29:33.857 --> 29:37.903
Oh, they'll wake up in an hour or so
with a pretty big headache. But they're fine,

29:37.945 --> 29:38.946
just like you.

29:38.987 --> 29:42.533
I'm a lot of things right now,
but fine isn't one of them.

29:43.033 --> 29:45.869
I stumbled across the dead ZPM in our archives.

29:46.286 --> 29:50.666
One of our operatives found it hundreds of years
ago, didn't know what it was, filed it away.

29:50.749 --> 29:53.877
I'm sure he had no idea how
valuable it would eventually be.

29:54.753 --> 29:56.046
So that was your plan?

29:57.047 --> 30:01.385
Lure us here, take our weapons,
trade us for some more,

30:01.426 --> 30:03.512
arm your rebellion. Is that about it?

30:03.971 --> 30:06.014
Couldn't be more wrong.

30:06.056 --> 30:09.101
There is no rebellion, Colonel Sheppard.

30:10.978 --> 30:14.940
Ladon here has only the best
interests of the Genii at heart.

30:19.862 --> 30:21.989
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

30:28.871 --> 30:29.997
What have we got?

30:30.622 --> 30:31.874
Not sure yet, ma'am.

30:31.957 --> 30:33.834
I'm not reading an IDC.

30:35.377 --> 30:38.213
What the hell is going on here?

30:38.463 --> 30:40.674
I want to talk with Dr. Weir.

30:40.716 --> 30:42.467
The Gate has to be active.

30:42.551 --> 30:44.136
<i>It already is.</i>

30:44.178 --> 30:45.762
Oh. Well...

30:51.018 --> 30:54.479
Dr. Weir, this is commander Cowen,
leader of the Genii.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.565
Where is colonel Sheppard?

30:56.607 --> 30:58.192
<i>Well, he's right here with me,</i>

30:58.567 --> 31:02.863
along with the men you
sent to storm this complex.

31:02.905 --> 31:05.532
Some would view that as an act of war.

31:05.782 --> 31:09.203
We were just trying to quell
your rebellion before it started.

31:09.244 --> 31:12.623
<i>I think we both know</i>
<i>what your intentions were, Doctor.</i>

31:12.664 --> 31:15.125
<i>And now it's time you became aware of mine.</i>

31:15.167 --> 31:18.754
I will release your men,
but I expect something in return.

31:18.795 --> 31:21.757
We have 12 of your own.
How about a straight trade?

31:21.798 --> 31:26.803
The Genii you've imagined as your
potential hostages are terminally ill.

31:26.845 --> 31:28.805
<i>They volunteered for the mission.</i>

31:28.847 --> 31:32.893
<i>They knew they were never coming back</i>
<i>from the moment they heard of my plan.</i>

31:34.353 --> 31:35.646
Why are you doing this?

31:35.687 --> 31:39.900
The Genii people need
the Lantian ships you call Jumpers.

31:39.942 --> 31:42.069
<i>I believe you have 10 of them.</i>

31:42.528 --> 31:45.906
<i>You have one hour to bring them all here.</i>

31:45.948 --> 31:47.616
And if I don't?

31:48.033 --> 31:53.830
<i>We will kill one of your team</i>
<i>every 15 minutes until our demands are met.</i>

31:53.872 --> 31:57.793
Oh! and we will be starting with colonel Sheppard.

32:08.262 --> 32:09.805
It's no use.

32:09.847 --> 32:12.975
The doctors on our world
have tried to cure all of us.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.894
I don't mean to speak ill of your doctors,

32:15.936 --> 32:18.522
but our medicines are
a lot more advanced than theirs.

32:18.564 --> 32:20.524
I know what you're trying to do.

32:20.649 --> 32:22.985
There's really nothing sinister about it, love.

32:23.026 --> 32:25.320
They won't give your men back.

32:25.904 --> 32:28.907
Even if you cure us, Cowen will never relent.

32:28.949 --> 32:31.118
I'm afraid that's not my department.

32:31.159 --> 32:33.996
Now, are you experiencing any pain at all?

32:34.079 --> 32:35.122
Why?

32:35.414 --> 32:36.790
Why would you help us?

32:36.832 --> 32:39.376
Because I'm a doctor. That's what I do.

32:39.418 --> 32:40.711
Why you would do this,

32:40.752 --> 32:43.505
allow yourself to be used like this?

32:45.007 --> 32:46.842
I'm dead anyway. What does it matter?

32:46.884 --> 32:49.261
Not yet, the last time I checked your pulse.

32:49.303 --> 32:51.388
Besides, even if there was no hope,

32:51.680 --> 32:54.600
I'd prefer to die surrounded by
my friends and family, in my own home.

32:54.641 --> 32:58.812
I am doing this to ensure
that my friends and family have a home.

32:58.979 --> 33:00.939
Can't you understand that?

33:00.981 --> 33:04.318
This is the one thing
that I can do and I am glad to do it.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.206
What do you want with the Jumpers?

33:19.583 --> 33:21.168
What do I want with

33:21.210 --> 33:27.007
invisible space ships that can fly
to other worlds and even deliver our atomic weapons?

33:27.049 --> 33:29.468
Well, since you put it that way.

33:30.594 --> 33:32.679
They're never gonna deal.

33:33.013 --> 33:35.641
You're going to have to kill us.

33:36.058 --> 33:39.102
I fully expect to have to kill you.

33:40.437 --> 33:43.273
Looking forward to it that much?

33:44.149 --> 33:47.986
Why didn't you just take us
hostage when we came to visit?

33:48.904 --> 33:52.950
Why take two hostages if you could have a dozen?

33:53.992 --> 33:56.119
Take him to his cell.

34:03.126 --> 34:07.339
Even if we give you the Jumpers, none
of the Genii will be able to fly them.

34:07.381 --> 34:08.465
Oh no?

34:08.507 --> 34:09.216
Why's that?

34:09.257 --> 34:10.842
You know why.

34:11.885 --> 34:16.764
Well, if you're referring to the ancient gene,
I'm working on a treatment
that could artificially produce it.

34:16.806 --> 34:20.351
In fact,
we've been collecting samples for some time.

34:20.393 --> 34:21.937
From where?

34:28.318 --> 34:29.862
<i>Lorne...</i>

34:30.529 --> 34:32.322
Starting to put it all together?

34:32.364 --> 34:34.324
I'm getting there.

34:36.702 --> 34:37.536
Major.

34:37.661 --> 34:38.620
Boys.

34:39.121 --> 34:40.789
Colonel.

34:44.376 --> 34:46.670
Way to be alive.

34:47.170 --> 34:48.547
Thanks, Sir.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.007
So...

34:50.215 --> 34:51.592
you come to rescue us?

34:51.632 --> 34:56.722
Well, until about a moment ago, I thought you were
dead but now that I see you speaking and breathing...

34:56.763 --> 34:58.640
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

34:58.682 --> 35:00.058
Well, good.

35:00.392 --> 35:03.312
Let me know if
there's anything we can do to help.

35:03.478 --> 35:06.064
Lieutenant Miller performed
a cloaked scan of the planet.

35:06.106 --> 35:10.652
It looks like the Genii have moved in a massive
amount of troops over the past 15 minutes.

35:10.694 --> 35:12.988
I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered.

35:13.030 --> 35:17.618
Any attempt to extract our men would
result in many casualties on both sides.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.119
Let me get in there and see what I can do.

35:19.161 --> 35:22.831
No, the last thing I need is for more
of us to fall into their hands.

35:23.123 --> 35:25.334
How are our Genii guests doing?

35:25.417 --> 35:29.213
Well, they have a number of different symptoms
and ailments, but they all trace back to one thing,

35:29.254 --> 35:31.048
radiation poisoning.

35:31.089 --> 35:35.719
Well, McKay warned them that the shielding for
their fission experiments was dangerously insufficient.

35:35.761 --> 35:36.929
I guess they didn't listen.

35:37.012 --> 35:38.180
Aye.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.599
Can you cure them?

35:40.933 --> 35:44.728
There are some experimental treatment
protocols I've been able to get my hands on,

35:44.770 --> 35:47.981
although some of them are just too far
gone to do anything but pain management,

35:48.023 --> 35:50.901
but I do believe I can save at least eight of them.

35:51.068 --> 35:52.569
Alright,

35:52.653 --> 35:55.072
let's hope they will trade their people for ours.

35:55.113 --> 35:56.573
Do we have a backup plan?

35:56.823 --> 35:59.660
We're not handing 10 of our Jumpers over to the Genii.

35:59.701 --> 36:02.329
Let's just hope this works.

36:04.456 --> 36:06.166
<i>I don't think you understand.</i>

36:06.208 --> 36:09.837
<i>Most of your people can be cured,</i>
<i>including Ladon's sister.</i>

36:12.548 --> 36:14.508
Oh, I understand.

36:14.550 --> 36:17.427
What you need to understand is I don't care.

36:18.303 --> 36:19.721
What?

36:20.222 --> 36:23.141
<i>I think you're playing for time, Dr. Weir.</i>

36:23.183 --> 36:25.894
Your people can be cured.

36:26.061 --> 36:32.192
Now, let me return them to you,
and let them live out the rest of their lives
with their families on their home world.

36:32.442 --> 36:34.444
The Genii need those Jumpers.

36:34.486 --> 36:37.698
Until you are prepared to part
with them, this conversation is over.

36:37.739 --> 36:40.993
You kill one of my people,
and we are in a state of war.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.744
Oh, yes, yes.

36:42.786 --> 36:46.248
Well, I don't quite know how I'll live with myself.

36:46.707 --> 36:50.085
I will contact you again in 15 minutes

36:50.127 --> 36:53.714
<i>so you can decide whether you</i>
<i>would like Dr. McKay to live.</i>

36:53.755 --> 36:57.593
In the meantime,
you have forfeited the life of colonel Sheppard.

36:57.634 --> 36:59.469
Cowen, wait!

37:06.226 --> 37:07.936
Kill him.

37:08.145 --> 37:10.272
Yes, Sir.

37:17.237 --> 37:18.822
What the hell happened?

37:18.864 --> 37:20.741
We got gassed.

37:20.782 --> 37:22.201
Are we in some sort of trouble?

37:22.743 --> 37:27.164
Was it the gas or the prison cell
that was your first clue?

37:33.545 --> 37:35.047
Time's up.

37:44.431 --> 37:45.516
Anything?

37:45.557 --> 37:48.393
We're still connected,
but he's turned the radio off.

37:48.894 --> 37:50.604
I'm not getting any signal.

37:50.687 --> 37:52.189
Damn it!

37:52.564 --> 37:53.815
Elizabeth,

37:53.857 --> 37:56.818
what if we offer them one Jumper
in exchange for colonel Sheppard?

37:56.860 --> 37:59.196
Carson, we have less than
15 minutes before they kill McKay.

37:59.238 --> 38:01.615
You can deliver all the Jumpers you want.

38:01.657 --> 38:02.950
They're going to kill everyone.

38:02.991 --> 38:04.868
We need to attack them now.

38:10.415 --> 38:13.961
Weir says your Dr. Beckett can cure
the people I sent through the Gate.

38:14.253 --> 38:15.087
Is that true?

38:15.128 --> 38:17.464
Beckett's the best doctor in two galaxies.

38:17.506 --> 38:18.757
If there's a cure,

38:18.966 --> 38:20.509
he's got it.

38:22.886 --> 38:24.721
We're letting them go.

38:32.688 --> 38:36.024
Hidden away at the bottom of
this building is a nuclear device.

38:36.066 --> 38:37.651
Where did you get your hands on that?

38:38.068 --> 38:40.195
You forget I'm the chief scientist.

38:40.237 --> 38:41.864
I made it.

38:42.114 --> 38:43.073
You're going to start your coup.

38:43.115 --> 38:46.410
I needed Cowen and
his elite guard together in one place.

38:46.451 --> 38:49.496
I knew the chance at some
Puddle Jumpers would get him here.

38:49.538 --> 38:50.455
Good one.

38:50.497 --> 38:53.417
Most of my men are waiting for me
on our home world.

38:54.042 --> 38:54.960
Tonight,

38:55.460 --> 38:58.046
the leadership of our people changes hands.

38:58.088 --> 39:01.633
You were just going to leave us here
to be vaporized with the others.

39:02.092 --> 39:03.886
Yes, I was...

39:05.512 --> 39:07.139
but things have changed.

39:07.181 --> 39:09.016
Let's go.

39:18.901 --> 39:20.944
Go see what's keeping him.

39:31.622 --> 39:32.497
It's alright.

39:32.539 --> 39:34.416
I'm just escorting these prisoners.

39:42.841 --> 39:44.009
There's a hidden passage this way.

39:44.051 --> 39:46.678
We shouldn't run into any more resistance.

39:49.264 --> 39:52.059
<i>Commander Cowen, someone has freed the Atlantians.</i>

39:52.100 --> 39:53.268
What?

39:56.855 --> 39:58.565
Ladon, come in!

39:59.608 --> 40:01.360
I'm receiving Dr. McKay's IDC.

40:01.401 --> 40:03.111
Defense teams stand by!

40:03.153 --> 40:04.696
Lower the shield.

40:10.244 --> 40:10.911
Rodney!

40:10.953 --> 40:11.828
It's Ladon.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.830
He's letting us go in exchange for his people.

40:13.872 --> 40:14.790
Ladon's in charge?

40:14.831 --> 40:16.416
Well, he's about to be.

40:16.667 --> 40:18.085
He really was planning a coup.

40:18.126 --> 40:20.921
Apparently, we're a part of the plan.

40:23.257 --> 40:25.425
Ladon, come in!

40:25.467 --> 40:26.635
<i>This is Ladon.</i>

40:26.677 --> 40:27.761
What's going on?

40:27.803 --> 40:30.472
I'm sorry it had to come to this, Cowen.

40:30.514 --> 40:32.808
<i>You have served our people well.</i>

40:34.643 --> 40:36.395
What have you done?

40:38.647 --> 40:39.982
Shield up.

40:46.196 --> 40:48.073
Now, please,

40:48.282 --> 40:50.701
I would like to see my sister.

40:58.625 --> 40:59.710
What are you doing?

40:59.751 --> 41:01.879
We found a malignant tumor
in your sister's left lung.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.922
We had to remove it as soon as possible.

41:03.964 --> 41:05.090
Not to worry.

41:05.132 --> 41:06.758
It was a complete success.

41:06.967 --> 41:08.468
She did great.

41:08.510 --> 41:09.845
And then she'll be cured?

41:09.887 --> 41:11.889
She's not out of the woods entirely,

41:11.972 --> 41:14.433
but if she keeps up with her treatments...

41:15.225 --> 41:18.228
Many Genii suffer from similar afflictions.

41:18.312 --> 41:21.815
We'd be more than happy to cure
as many of your people as we can...

41:22.149 --> 41:24.776
the ones who survive your coup, that is.

41:24.818 --> 41:26.778
I don't anticipate any more casualties.

41:26.820 --> 41:27.529
Good.

41:27.571 --> 41:29.406
Let's make that a condition.

41:30.949 --> 41:32.784
My day is far from over.

41:33.118 --> 41:34.995
I must return to my planet.

41:35.037 --> 41:36.288
We'll take good care of her.

41:36.330 --> 41:37.497
I promise.

41:38.123 --> 41:39.833
Thank you, Doctor.

41:55.557 --> 41:57.559
The coup was successful.

41:57.601 --> 42:00.896
Ladon Radim is the new leader of the Genii.

42:01.271 --> 42:02.731
Wow, that was fast.

42:02.773 --> 42:07.903
Yeah, once people found out Cowen
and his elite guard were out of the picture,
his loyalists laid down their weapons.

42:07.945 --> 42:12.199
They're billing it as a bloodless coup
because no one died on their home soil.

42:12.241 --> 42:16.620
So a nuclear explosion and the lives of
an entire battalion of men don't count?

42:16.662 --> 42:18.580
Yeah. It's all spin.

42:18.789 --> 42:20.832
What do you think the fallout's going to be?

42:20.874 --> 42:25.254
Well, historically, most coups end up with
the new government being about as bad as the old one.

42:25.671 --> 42:29.091
I don't know, he seemed pretty
grateful we saved his sister.

42:29.132 --> 42:30.050
There's that.

42:30.092 --> 42:31.802
And he did save me and my team.

42:32.094 --> 42:33.512
There's that, too.

42:33.762 --> 42:36.265
So I say we call it a win.

42:36.306 --> 42:37.766
Who's spinning now?

42:38.225 --> 42:40.060
Alright.

42:40.352 --> 42:42.688
Then I say we call it a night.

42:43.146 --> 42:44.481
That we can do.
