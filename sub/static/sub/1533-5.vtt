00:07.280 --> 00:10.807
<i>When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:13.361
<i>My father went to prison for her murder.</i>

00:14.200 --> 00:16.521
<i>Then an accident
made me the impossible.</i>

<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...</i>

00:20.960 --> 00:25.522
<i>...but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime
and find others like me.</i>

00:25.760 --> 00:30.209
<i>And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.</i>

00:39.760 --> 00:42.001
We talked about you helping
contain metahumans.

After all these classes, I started a blog.

not science fiction.

you've believed in the impossible.

about why your friends came into your life?</i>

01:06.120 --> 01:10.887

or maybe a little of both?</i>

<i>Regardless of the reason...</i>

01:13.400 --> 01:17.883

<i>...who, well, you hope someday
becomes something more.</i>

01:29.200 --> 01:32.488
<i>But friend will have to do for now...</i>

-They saved your life.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.247

I've ever met.

their own unique signatures.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.162
Crimped wires, fragmentation.

-Sounds like there's a "but" coming.

About 10 years ago General
Wade Eiling contracted S.T.A.R. Labs...

09:47.440 --> 09:49.807
...to develop enhanced gene therapies
for soldiers.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.531
I was interested in the medical benefits
for civilians.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.281
General Eiling really wanted
to develop mind-reading capabilities...

09:56.440 --> 09:58.363
...for interrogation purposes.

I ended the study when I saw his techniques,

I don't think she meant to hurt me.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.845
Or her being a metahuman explains
General Eiling's interest in her.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.849
And why he stole the case from us.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.285
