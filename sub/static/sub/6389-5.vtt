10:33.754 --> 10:37.023
and we look at that as a, um...

10:37.057 --> 10:39.592
you know, last-resort situation?

10:39.627 --> 10:43.196
You know, the very least
you could fucking do

10:43.230 --> 10:45.565
is call him and rip him a new asshole

10:45.599 --> 10:47.534
so that he knows I can't be treated

10:47.568 --> 10:49.135
like some girl from the street, okay?

10:49.170 --> 10:51.805
I'm a world-class writer and producer,

10:51.839 --> 10:53.807
and I'm gonna have my own show one day,

10:53.841 --> 10:55.708
if that means giving up every ounce

10:55.743 --> 10:59.445
of personal happiness to get it.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.080
I will talk to him.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.451
- Promise?
- I promise.

11:10.524 --> 11:11.891
Will you drive me home?

11:11.926 --> 11:14.561
- Sure thing, Goldie.
- Okay.

11:14.595 --> 11:17.096
- Let's go.
- One more drink.

11:20.034 --> 11:22.101
- Aah! Raah!
- He's a little monster!

11:22.136 --> 11:23.970
I'm gonna getcha, I'm gonna getcha,

11:24.004 --> 11:26.906
- I'm gonna getcha!
- I'm gonna get you!

11:26.941 --> 11:28.508
Oh, my God.

11:28.542 --> 11:30.944
This is the best playdate
Stuart's ever had.

11:30.978 --> 11:34.180
They do have chemistry, that's for sure.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.249
- He seems like a good kid.
- He is, he is.

11:36.283 --> 11:38.151
I just wish I could get him laid.

11:38.185 --> 11:39.619
Can you get me laid?

11:39.653 --> 11:41.921
Maybe we can kill two pervs with one stone.

11:41.956 --> 11:44.924
You deflower him. It's a win-win.

11:44.959 --> 11:46.993
Listen, I'm horny as fuck these days,

11:47.027 --> 11:48.595
but seriously, I don't think

11:48.629 --> 11:49.829
that kid's gonna last long enough

11:49.864 --> 11:51.297
for mommy to get hers.

11:51.332 --> 11:53.333
Maybe he needs professional help.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.268
What, like a therapist?

11:55.302 --> 11:57.437
Yeah, or a...

11:57.471 --> 11:58.972
[Clicking tongue]

11:59.006 --> 12:00.807
- Like a hooker?
- Yeah.

12:00.841 --> 12:03.209
Hank, I waxed a hooker today.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.278
She was young and cute
and totally down to fuck.

12:05.312 --> 12:06.446
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.214
[Stu grunting]

12:08.249 --> 12:10.950
- Probably spendy.
- It's only money, right?

12:10.985 --> 12:13.186
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:13.220 --> 12:16.122
That kid would love you forever
if you bust his hymen like that.

12:16.156 --> 12:18.458
Chick was fucking bananas hot!

12:18.492 --> 12:19.792
This sounds too good to be true.

12:19.827 --> 12:21.294
- Let's just hold on a second.
- Okay.

12:21.328 --> 12:23.162
Just wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:23.197 --> 12:25.231
Is this wrong?

12:25.266 --> 12:28.635
I can't tell anymore. I
can't fucking tell anymore.

12:28.669 --> 12:30.970
Me neither.

12:31.005 --> 12:33.306
[Laughing]

12:33.340 --> 12:36.109
- Let me see if she's available.
- Good idea.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.383
- Hello, again.
- Hi.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.985
Thanks for the rip this morning.
My pussy looks fantastic.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.720
It really does. I mean, great job!

12:47.755 --> 12:49.355
You could eat off the fucking thing.

12:49.390 --> 12:51.224
Thank you. And you are?

12:51.258 --> 12:52.825
Jim. Nice to meet you, sweetie.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.494
Oh. Nice to meet you too.

12:54.528 --> 12:55.695
Is this him?

12:55.729 --> 12:58.197
No! Ha ha! No, sorry.

12:58.232 --> 12:59.766
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited

12:59.800 --> 13:01.334
about the fucking Johns here.

13:01.368 --> 13:03.336
Sorry. He's a really good-looking guy.

13:03.370 --> 13:05.104
You must be the pimp.

13:05.139 --> 13:07.840
What is this, like a
fucking blaxploitation movie?

13:07.875 --> 13:09.909
I mean, we don't really use
that terminology anymore.

13:09.944 --> 13:11.277
Oh.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.612
Yeah, I'm more like her manager,

13:12.646 --> 13:13.713
the guy that you hand the money to...

13:13.747 --> 13:14.914
- Okay.
- Like, right now.

13:14.949 --> 13:16.382
Oh, oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

13:16.417 --> 13:18.051
So how does it work? What's the split?

13:18.085 --> 13:19.452
My guy gets 15%,

13:19.486 --> 13:21.621
and his pimp hand is not strong at all.

13:21.655 --> 13:23.856
What are you, the Better Business Bureau?

13:23.891 --> 13:25.358
Don't worry about it.

13:25.392 --> 13:26.793
Where's this dude she's gonna fuck?

13:26.827 --> 13:27.794
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!

13:27.828 --> 13:29.228
- Karen, hello.
- Hi!

13:29.263 --> 13:31.230
- Hi!
- Karen! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:31.265 --> 13:33.366
Why don't you get your
guests a drink or something?

13:33.400 --> 13:36.235
- Yes, I'm gonna do it.
- What are you doing here?

13:36.270 --> 13:37.904
Um, well, you've been ducking my calls.

13:37.938 --> 13:39.372
I know, I know, I know.

13:39.406 --> 13:42.075
Okay, so I want to talk to you about Becca.

13:42.109 --> 13:43.409
I know. That's why I'm ducking you.

13:43.444 --> 13:45.011
Well, why?

13:45.045 --> 13:46.612
I mean, when are you
gonna tell her about Levon?

13:46.647 --> 13:48.448
- When is she getting back?
- In a few weeks.

13:48.482 --> 13:50.550
- In a few weeks, then.
- Well, Hank,

13:50.584 --> 13:53.386
she wants to know why
you're ducking her calls too.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.154
Karen, I'm not gonna
talk to her on the phone

13:55.189 --> 13:56.422
about this shit, okay?

13:56.457 --> 13:57.924
And in fact, when I do it,

13:57.958 --> 13:59.659
I think we should do
it together, you and I.

13:59.693 --> 14:00.994
- No!
- Yeah.

14:01.028 --> 14:03.029
No, no, no. I knew...

14:03.063 --> 14:04.697
I am not gonna get involved

14:04.732 --> 14:07.100
in your dysfunctional shit, okay?

14:07.134 --> 14:09.002
What is... what are you hi... what is this?

14:09.036 --> 14:10.336
What do you mean? What do you mean?

14:10.371 --> 14:11.704
Who is this?

14:11.739 --> 14:15.174
Marcy invited some waxing clients over.

14:15.209 --> 14:17.043
- Isn't that right, Marcy?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:17.077 --> 14:19.779
I'm having a client over for a drink.

14:19.813 --> 14:22.548
Okay, well, um, how come she's here so late

14:22.583 --> 14:24.350
and dressed so slutty?

14:24.385 --> 14:25.685
Maybe she's gonna get a facial.

14:25.719 --> 14:26.819
Right. Really?

14:26.854 --> 14:28.321
Does she always travel with...

14:28.355 --> 14:29.689
[Whispering] sex toys?

14:29.723 --> 14:31.691
You know, some people are not so averse

14:31.725 --> 14:34.260
- to, uh, rubberized help.
- That's true.

14:34.294 --> 14:36.529
Yay! Mission accomplished.

14:36.563 --> 14:38.831
Little Stuart is officially asleep.

14:38.866 --> 14:40.433
We read books. We played the tickle game.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.668
He loves the tickle game!

14:42.703 --> 14:44.170
I know. I also taught
him how to dutch oven.

14:44.204 --> 14:45.538
He loved it.

14:45.572 --> 14:47.373
Kid loves farts. Ooh, you did good.

14:47.408 --> 14:50.076
- Thanks.
- Is this him?

14:50.110 --> 14:52.979
Who... who's him? Who am I?

14:53.013 --> 14:54.647
- Who are you?
- You know what?

14:54.681 --> 14:56.049
Let's get this fucking
party started, all right?

14:56.083 --> 14:57.650
We got another appointment later.

14:57.684 --> 14:59.652
Okay, kid, you got to wear a rubber, okay?

14:59.686 --> 15:01.587
Anything off the menu
has to be approved by me.

15:01.622 --> 15:05.258
I mean, she's pretty open, as
you can see, but scat play...

15:05.292 --> 15:06.659
definitely out of the question.

15:06.693 --> 15:09.829
Oh, my God. You got him a hooker.

15:09.863 --> 15:11.197
Karen, that is ridiculous.

15:11.231 --> 15:14.267
Marcy was kind enough to set Levon up

15:14.301 --> 15:16.836
- with one of her clients.
- One of your clients?

15:16.870 --> 15:19.272
I'm... I'm... I'm setting him up with her.

15:19.306 --> 15:21.541
Look at what a cute couple
they would make, adorable.

15:21.575 --> 15:22.708
Marcy...

15:22.743 --> 15:24.243
is your client a hooker?

15:24.278 --> 15:26.112
Who knows what she does
for a living, Karen?

15:26.146 --> 15:27.580
- That's personal.
- Shut up.

15:27.614 --> 15:29.415
Is your client a hooker?

15:29.450 --> 15:31.350
- Maybe.
- Marcy!

15:31.385 --> 15:33.853
Hey! I am happy to help you

15:33.887 --> 15:36.122
try to bust your weirdo kid's cherry,

15:36.156 --> 15:38.724
but I will not lie to my best friend.

15:38.759 --> 15:41.894
Oh, my God. This is so fucking depraved.

15:41.896 --> 15:43.196
No, it's not.

15:43.230 --> 15:45.031
I-I'm performing a service here.

15:45.065 --> 15:47.233
This kid's... he needs
to clear this hurdle.

15:47.267 --> 15:49.802
He's all wired and pent-up.
He's got to get the poison out.

15:49.837 --> 15:52.472
- That's what Stu always says.
- It's true.

15:52.506 --> 15:53.873
Once you get that shit out of your system,

15:53.907 --> 15:55.541
then you can think clearly again.

15:55.576 --> 15:58.478
You... you got me a fucking hooker?

15:59.813 --> 16:02.548
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.917
This is exactly what I thought
having a father would be like.

16:04.952 --> 16:07.386
Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

16:07.421 --> 16:09.122
No. No, no, no, no.

16:09.156 --> 16:10.556
I know... I know this has,

16:10.591 --> 16:12.892
like, absolutely nothing to do with me,

16:12.926 --> 16:15.761
but... but, um, I feel that someone here

16:15.796 --> 16:18.598
should be representing
your mom's interests.

16:18.632 --> 16:20.666
- Why? That's fucking weird.
- No, no, no.

16:20.701 --> 16:22.335
Because she would not want you

16:22.369 --> 16:24.137
to lose your virginity like this.

16:24.171 --> 16:25.972
Oh, my God, you told her I'm a virgin?

16:26.006 --> 16:27.140
That's fucking embarrassing, dude!

16:27.174 --> 16:28.574
No, of course he didn't.

16:28.609 --> 16:30.109
No offense, but you don't present

16:30.144 --> 16:31.577
as a guy who's knee-deep
in a river of pussy.

16:31.612 --> 16:33.980
Yet it's all I ever think about.

16:34.014 --> 16:36.949
- Okay, so the first time...
it should be special, right? - Yeah.

16:36.984 --> 16:38.951
And it should be someone you care about,

16:38.986 --> 16:41.687
someone you love, you
like, at least... like.

16:41.722 --> 16:43.456
- Right?
- I completely agree.

16:43.490 --> 16:46.325
And I could easily see myself
falling in love with her.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.761
I totally like her right now.
Do you see what she's wearing?

16:48.795 --> 16:50.630
- It's...
- I do, yeah.

16:50.664 --> 16:52.532
But it's not something that
you would want to pay for.

16:52.566 --> 16:54.000
I'm not paying for anything.

16:54.034 --> 16:55.968
I haven't even got a paycheck yet.

16:56.003 --> 16:57.637
There's all these forms I'm
supposed to fill out and shit.

16:57.671 --> 16:59.839
Actually, can you help me out with that?

16:59.873 --> 17:02.475
Money's taken care of. That's no problem.

17:02.509 --> 17:04.109
I fucking love you, dad.

17:04.144 --> 17:05.778
I fucking love you too, buddy.

17:05.811 --> 17:07.780
No. No, no, no. Stop it, stop it.

17:07.814 --> 17:10.616
Look, Levon, Levon, I know
this is very confusing for you.

17:10.651 --> 17:12.285
I get that.
I-I-I...

17:12.319 --> 17:13.819
Okay, take a moment. Just take a moment.

17:13.854 --> 17:15.221
Just... [Exhales deeply]

17:15.255 --> 17:16.289
- [Exhales deeply]
- Just... yeah.

17:16.323 --> 17:17.623
- Breathe.
- [Exhales deeply]

17:17.657 --> 17:19.125
Yeah. Okay.

17:19.159 --> 17:21.794
- Now, think about your mother.
- Oh, gross!

17:21.828 --> 17:23.429
That's the last thing
I want to think about.

17:23.463 --> 17:25.298
No, no, no! About what she would say.

17:25.332 --> 17:27.098
Creepy cosby family, are
we gonna do this or what?

17:27.134 --> 17:29.936
It's up to you, but there's
no fucking refunds here.

17:29.970 --> 17:32.605
If you want a credit,
there's a 25% restocking fee.

17:32.639 --> 17:34.040
That's fucking steep, bro.

17:34.074 --> 17:35.541
Hey, it's a seller's market, dude.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.176
Hold... hold... hold on.

17:37.211 --> 17:38.611
- Karen.
- Yes!

17:38.645 --> 17:40.112
Do you want to fuck me?

17:40.147 --> 17:42.114
- No!
- Oh!

17:42.149 --> 17:43.516
What is wrong with you? Did you...

17:43.550 --> 17:44.951
I didn't raise him.

17:44.985 --> 17:46.986
Right now the only person in this room

17:47.020 --> 17:48.054
willing to fuck me is the one getting paid.

17:48.088 --> 17:49.455
Oh.

17:49.489 --> 17:51.157
And I think I'm okay with that.

17:51.191 --> 17:52.692
You know what? In fact, I'm
more than okay with that.

17:52.726 --> 17:54.794
I'm super fucking psyched. I'm doing this.

17:54.828 --> 17:56.796
Okay.

17:56.830 --> 17:58.564
- Hey, dad?
- Yeah.

17:58.599 --> 18:02.368
- The clit's on top, right?
- Last I checked, yeah.

18:03.670 --> 18:05.871
Okay.

18:05.906 --> 18:07.807
There you go, you lean there.

18:07.841 --> 18:10.576
I'll get the door.

18:12.779 --> 18:15.414
Good job.

18:15.449 --> 18:19.218
[Sighs deeply]

18:19.253 --> 18:21.387
Okay!

18:21.421 --> 18:26.158
[Clears throat] Here we go.

18:26.193 --> 18:29.528
Hey! What are you doing?

18:29.563 --> 18:33.199
I'm... I'm driving you home.

18:33.233 --> 18:37.503
Uh, no. No, not in your car...

18:37.537 --> 18:39.205
<i>In my car.</i>

18:39.239 --> 18:41.240
How am I supposed to get to work tomorrow?

18:41.275 --> 18:44.076
Well, how am I gonna get home tonight?

18:44.111 --> 18:47.446
I don't give a fuck. That's your problem.

18:47.481 --> 18:50.216
You can take a fucking
rickshaw, for all I care.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.551
No, you take me home. You walk me in.

18:52.586 --> 18:54.253
You make sure that I am safe.

18:54.288 --> 18:56.222
And then you need to position me

18:56.256 --> 18:58.157
so that I don't choke on my own vomit.

18:58.191 --> 19:00.026
Okay, okay.

19:00.060 --> 19:01.994
If that's what you need, sure.

19:02.029 --> 19:03.496
Hold on. That's not a good idea,

19:03.530 --> 19:05.898
because then you're gonna get in my house.

19:05.932 --> 19:08.668
You'll want to take advantage
of me in my inebriated state.

19:08.702 --> 19:10.703
I would never do something like that.

19:10.737 --> 19:15.007
Oh, I'm not hot enough
to take advantage of.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.543
No, no! You're plenty hot, Goldie.

19:17.577 --> 19:20.880
You're... you're crazy hot!

19:20.914 --> 19:22.748
Thank you. I appreciate it.

19:22.783 --> 19:25.017
Thank you for taking care of me tonight.

19:25.052 --> 19:26.585
- I really appreciate it.
- You know what?

19:26.620 --> 19:28.254
That's just what I do, okay?

19:28.288 --> 19:31.090
That's full-service management, all right?

19:31.124 --> 19:33.225
Curb to curb.

19:33.260 --> 19:37.530
You know, if someone would've told me

19:37.564 --> 19:41.701
that I was gonna be represented one day...

19:41.735 --> 19:44.236
[Sighs] by the masturbating agent,

19:44.271 --> 19:49.542
I would've just shit my panties.

19:49.576 --> 19:51.711
Wonders never cease.

19:51.745 --> 19:53.312
Can I ask you something?

19:53.347 --> 19:55.481
What made you want to throw it all away

19:55.515 --> 19:58.984
for a couple of random jerk-off sessions?

19:59.019 --> 20:02.788
I guess it's just the very same thing

20:02.823 --> 20:06.492
that makes me such a great representative.

20:06.526 --> 20:09.929
I'm ready to burn it all
down at a moment's notice.

20:09.963 --> 20:14.233
Oh, burn it all down. I like that.

20:14.267 --> 20:16.068
Burn it all down.

20:16.103 --> 20:18.771
I'm gonna get that in a
tattoo on my bikini line.

20:18.805 --> 20:20.439
We should get tattoos. Let's go.

20:20.474 --> 20:22.508
No! No.

20:22.542 --> 20:25.311
You never get a tattoo under the influence.

20:25.345 --> 20:28.981
That's how you wind up with
a butterfly tramp stamp.

20:29.015 --> 20:31.584
[Both laughing]

20:31.618 --> 20:34.120
You're funny. You're funny.

20:34.154 --> 20:35.621
- Okay.
- You're really funny.

20:35.655 --> 20:38.391
Give me a hug.

20:38.425 --> 20:42.061
You know, I could feel
you getting hard last week

20:42.095 --> 20:43.562
when we were hugging.

20:43.597 --> 20:46.265
I'm sorry about that.

20:46.299 --> 20:49.402
You're getting hard right now, aren't you?

20:49.436 --> 20:51.904
Why does this keep happening to me?

20:51.938 --> 20:55.941
[Stomach gurgling]

20:55.976 --> 20:58.544
Oh, shit. I don't feel so good.

20:58.578 --> 21:02.581
- Oh.
- [Gagging]

21:02.616 --> 21:04.350
Okay.

21:04.384 --> 21:06.619
- It's okay.
- Okay.

21:06.653 --> 21:08.187
[Retches]

21:08.221 --> 21:10.256
- [Sighs]
- Oh.

21:10.290 --> 21:11.924
Sorry.

21:11.958 --> 21:14.093
I think I'm allergic to sulfites.

21:14.127 --> 21:15.961
I'm so sorry.

21:15.996 --> 21:19.598
My first time wasn't special at all.

21:19.633 --> 21:22.802
Dude kissed me a couple of times,

21:22.836 --> 21:25.137
paid zero attention to my tits,

21:25.172 --> 21:28.374
licked me twice, stuck it in once,

21:28.408 --> 21:30.376
panicked, pulled out,

21:30.410 --> 21:32.445
and shot a load all over my thigh.

21:32.479 --> 21:34.013
Fun stuff.

21:34.047 --> 21:37.683
Well, at least it got you
prepared for Papa Runks.

21:37.717 --> 21:39.718
What was your first time like, pretty lady?

21:39.753 --> 21:41.954
Shut up.

21:41.988 --> 21:43.489
You looking to make any extra money?

21:43.523 --> 21:46.959
I could turn you out, no problem.

21:46.993 --> 21:49.462
You're a feisty one. I like that.

21:49.496 --> 21:51.730
Nice.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.167
Karen...

21:55.202 --> 21:57.203
Karen. I'm sorry about that.

21:57.237 --> 21:59.205
You know, I don't know what's worse...

21:59.239 --> 22:00.639
what's going on here tonight,

22:00.674 --> 22:02.475
which is absolutely fucking disgusting,

22:02.509 --> 22:04.510
or the fact that I don't
even know who you are anymore.

22:04.544 --> 22:06.045
That's not fair.

22:06.079 --> 22:07.580
If we had a son, we'd most probably

22:07.614 --> 22:09.548
be having the same conversation,

22:09.583 --> 22:11.851
and I would probably
feel exactly the same way.

22:11.885 --> 22:13.819
If we had a son, I would never, ever

22:13.854 --> 22:15.421
let you do something like this.

22:15.455 --> 22:17.723
Karen, it's just sex. What's the big deal?

22:17.757 --> 22:20.392
But it's not just sex.
That's the whole point.

22:20.427 --> 22:24.396
You're teaching him to
degrade and objectify women,

22:24.431 --> 22:26.832
that they exist solely
to satisfy his urges,

22:26.867 --> 22:29.502
when you could, in fact, be teaching him

22:29.536 --> 22:33.772
that the best kind of sex
comes from making a connection.

22:33.807 --> 22:37.042
I agree with you. I do.

22:37.077 --> 22:39.278
It's just, there are all
different types of sex

22:39.312 --> 22:40.713
to be had,

22:40.747 --> 22:42.815
and who says he has to make sweet love

22:42.849 --> 22:44.383
his very first time out the gate?

22:44.417 --> 22:45.985
Hi.

22:46.019 --> 22:48.187
- Hank, is it?
- Yeah.

22:48.221 --> 22:52.992
Um, could you come in here for a second?

22:53.026 --> 22:54.360
[Door closes]

22:59.633 --> 23:02.067
Hey, it's more for a threesome.

23:02.102 --> 23:04.336
Just saying.

23:04.371 --> 23:05.838
What's up?

23:05.872 --> 23:07.239
I think your boy's a little nervous.

23:07.274 --> 23:08.908
That's totally understandable.

23:08.942 --> 23:10.543
I asked him to unwrap my dress,

23:10.577 --> 23:13.012
and then he almost passed out.

23:13.046 --> 23:16.448
I'm dizzy, Hank. I'm
shaking like a leaf, man.

23:16.483 --> 23:18.450
Is... is it possible I'm
having a heart attack?

23:18.485 --> 23:20.419
- Here, feel.
- Mm. Mm-mm.

23:20.453 --> 23:22.221
Maybe there's an
underlying medical condition

23:22.255 --> 23:23.622
or something I don't even know about.

23:23.657 --> 23:25.691
M-m-maybe I should
go see a doctor.

23:25.725 --> 23:27.459
Maybe we made a mistake here.

23:27.494 --> 23:29.094
May... maybe Karen's right.

23:29.129 --> 23:30.596
Maybe this isn't the way

23:30.630 --> 23:32.698
it's supposed to go down for me, you know?

23:32.732 --> 23:34.366
Maybe I'm supposed to meet a nice girl

23:34.401 --> 23:36.869
and somehow sweet-talk her
into letting me foul her.

23:36.903 --> 23:38.704
You don't have to go
through with this, you know,

23:38.738 --> 23:40.272
not at all.

23:40.307 --> 23:42.408
You... you wouldn't be disappointed in me?

23:42.442 --> 23:44.209
No way, never.

23:44.244 --> 23:46.045
God, I'm so fucking lame,

23:46.079 --> 23:47.713
and you're such a fucking baller.

23:47.747 --> 23:49.748
You are not lame in the slightest.

23:49.783 --> 23:51.417
You're a bright, interesting kid,

23:51.451 --> 23:53.118
and you got a shitload
of love in your heart.

23:53.153 --> 23:54.954
I do.

23:54.988 --> 23:57.323
You've made the past few weeks
of my life very interesting.

23:57.357 --> 23:59.825
- I'm happy to know you.
- Oh, thanks, Dad.

23:59.859 --> 24:03.162
- All right.
- Aw, guys...

24:03.196 --> 24:06.098
This is maybe one of the
sweetest fucking things

24:06.132 --> 24:07.566
I've ever seen.

24:07.601 --> 24:09.268
But I have another appointment to get to.

24:09.302 --> 24:10.869
So, if we're not gonna do this,

24:10.904 --> 24:12.271
then I'm just gonna grab
my double-sided dildo,

24:12.305 --> 24:13.606
and I'm just gonna go.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.240
What do you think?

24:15.275 --> 24:16.742
What do you think?

24:16.776 --> 24:18.577
<i>- What do you think?
- I don't know.</i>

24:18.612 --> 24:20.379
Here's what I think.

24:24.951 --> 24:26.919
Oh.

24:26.953 --> 24:30.255
That's what she thinks.

24:30.290 --> 24:32.324
So what's it gonna be?

24:34.794 --> 24:37.096
Get the fuck out of here, okay?

24:37.130 --> 24:40.265
Gone.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.468
Oh, and if you find
yourself getting too excited,

24:42.502 --> 24:43.936
just think about your grandfather

24:43.971 --> 24:45.470
and peeing in his colostomy bag,

24:45.505 --> 24:47.840
works like a charm. Trust!

24:52.545 --> 24:54.279
Hi.

24:57.751 --> 25:00.452
What's going on?

25:00.487 --> 25:03.622
Uh, well, Levon is losing
his virginity to a hooker

25:03.657 --> 25:06.291
in the guest room right now.

25:06.326 --> 25:08.293
Good for him.

25:08.328 --> 25:09.995
Good for him.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.131
- And who are you?
- He's the pimp.

25:12.165 --> 25:14.433
Jesus Christ.

25:14.467 --> 25:16.802
I handle the fucking money,
and I keep her safe from creeps.

25:16.836 --> 25:18.504
Don't be such a condescending prick.

25:18.538 --> 25:20.272
He's the pimp?

25:20.306 --> 25:22.741
Did you piss your pants or something?

25:22.776 --> 25:25.477
Done deal.

25:25.512 --> 25:27.746
Another happy customer.

25:27.781 --> 25:30.215
Kid's got a sick fucking
hog on him, by the way.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.650
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited

25:31.685 --> 25:32.918
about their fucking cocks.

25:32.952 --> 25:34.386
Well, what?

25:34.421 --> 25:35.821
Some of them are better
and nicer than others.

25:35.855 --> 25:37.222
It's a fact.

25:37.257 --> 25:39.625
I had such a fun time, sweetie!

25:39.659 --> 25:42.061
Call me anytime. Tweet me, whatever.

25:42.095 --> 25:43.262
I will. Definitely.

25:43.296 --> 25:44.596
You definitely will not!

25:44.631 --> 25:46.231
That shit's expensive.

25:46.266 --> 25:48.901
Well, we offer a frequent-flyer discount.

25:48.935 --> 25:51.403
Peace out, weirdos.

25:51.438 --> 25:52.771
Bye, you honey!

25:52.806 --> 25:55.441
Bye, Marcy. Thank you.

25:55.475 --> 25:57.609
[Grunts] Take me to bed, Runks.

25:57.644 --> 25:59.244
I haven't been laid in so long,

25:59.279 --> 26:01.280
I'm starting to feel
like a born-again virgin.

26:01.314 --> 26:03.816
I'm not feeling very amorous, Marcy.

26:03.850 --> 26:06.418
My new client puked into my crotch tonight.

26:06.453 --> 26:10.089
- Yeah, I can smell it.
- Have a seat, Harpo.

26:10.123 --> 26:11.990
Ah, man.

26:12.025 --> 26:15.260
- How you feeling?
- Amazing. Amazing.

26:15.295 --> 26:17.596
It's like my head is so
fucking clear right now,

26:17.630 --> 26:18.964
you know?

26:18.998 --> 26:20.499
It feel like I understand the relationship

26:20.533 --> 26:22.101
between shit in the universe a lot better.

26:22.135 --> 26:23.635
I feel like I could honestly solve

26:23.670 --> 26:25.204
some of the world's bigger problems.

26:25.238 --> 26:27.272
- You got the poison out.
- Yes. Exactly.

26:27.307 --> 26:28.707
Yeah.

26:28.742 --> 26:30.008
How long's this feeling gonna last?

26:30.043 --> 26:32.344
- About six or seven minutes.
- Shit.

26:32.378 --> 26:34.379
Better enjoy it, then.

26:34.414 --> 26:37.649
Oh, hey, that thing with my
grandpa and the colostomy bag

26:37.684 --> 26:39.051
totally worked.

26:39.085 --> 26:41.720
How'd you know he had a bag?

26:41.755 --> 26:43.188
- What?
- You know how you

26:43.223 --> 26:44.723
tell your mother everything, you said?

26:44.758 --> 26:46.391
Are you gonna tell her about this?

26:46.426 --> 26:47.960
- No. No fucking way.
- Okay.

26:47.994 --> 26:49.862
Karen was right. She
would be totally pissed

26:49.896 --> 26:51.296
- and think it was all fucking gross
- Yeah.

26:51.331 --> 26:52.698
and misogynistic and shit.

26:52.732 --> 26:53.966
Okay, well, that's good to know.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.968
Yeah. Hey, dad?

26:56.002 --> 26:57.536
- Yeah?
- Thanks again.

26:57.570 --> 27:00.172
This was truly an epic
fucking night in the life,

27:00.206 --> 27:02.374
and I will never, ever
forget it, obviously.

27:02.408 --> 27:04.309
You're welcome. You're welcome.

27:04.344 --> 27:07.246
That's a wet one.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.548
You better get me a
kick-ass father's day gift.

27:09.582 --> 27:11.416
Oh, you know I will.

27:11.451 --> 27:13.519
In fact, I think I'm gonna
book you some time with Nikki.

27:13.553 --> 27:15.487
She did this thing with her vagina.

27:15.522 --> 27:19.858
- It was talking to my dick.
- That's too much.

27:21.127 --> 27:22.861
- Smell my fingers.
- Go to bed.

27:22.896 --> 27:24.563
Okay.
