THROUGH WITH VICTOR, I'M STILL

00:07.041 --> 00:08.109
GUN-SHY.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.277
>> YEAH, BUT I CAN RELATE.

00:09.277 --> 00:10.711
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS INDIA, I

00:10.711 --> 00:12.113
THOUGHT I FOUND THE LOVE OF MY

00:12.113 --> 00:13.181
LIFE, BUT PADMA ENDED UP

00:13.181 --> 00:14.248
MARRYING SOMEONE ELSE.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.369
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER YOU

01:08.369 --> 01:09.370
TELLING ME YOU WANTED TO GIVE

01:09.370 --> 01:10.638
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH TAYLOR A

01:10.638 --> 01:12.340
CHANCE, BUT YOU COULDN'T DO THAT

01:12.340 --> 01:13.374
BECAUSE I WAS IN THE WAY.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.508
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

01:14.508 --> 01:15.476
SHE LEFT YOU?

01:15.476 --> 01:16.377
>> NO.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.146
WE'RE STILL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

01:18.146 --> 01:19.180
STILL DOING OUR THING,

01:19.180 --> 01:20.181
AND THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I

01:20.181 --> 01:21.315
SAID.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.416
>> SOMETHING ELSE I DISTINCTLY

01:22.416 --> 01:23.851
REMEMBER IS TELLING YOU I HAD

01:23.851 --> 01:25.353
NOTHING ELSE TO SAY TO YOU, AND

01:25.353 --> 01:26.287
I'M ALREADY BREAKING THAT

01:26.287 --> 01:27.421
PROMISE BY BEING HERE.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.789
>> SEE, I MISS THAT.

01:28.789 --> 01:29.657
>> WHAT?

01:29.657 --> 01:31.192
>> THE SMART MOUTH.

01:31.192 --> 01:35.329
THE ATTITUDE, EVERYTHING.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.598
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.233
YOU KNOW YOUR FEET HURT.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.668
>> I STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY

01:40.668 --> 01:41.769
I'M HERE, MALCOLM.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.237
BUT IF ALL YOU WANTED TO DO WAS

01:43.237 --> 01:44.838
LOOK AT ME, YOU COULD'VE PULLED

01:44.838 --> 01:46.674
UP A PICTURE ON YOUR CELL PHONE.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.176
OR DID YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND

01:48.176 --> 01:49.377
MAKE YOU DELETE THOSE TOO?

01:49.377 --> 01:52.213
>> OKAY, IT WAS UNFAIR, ALL

01:52.213 --> 01:53.381
RIGHT?

01:53.381 --> 01:54.648
AND HYPOCRITICAL OF ME TO

01:54.648 --> 01:55.883
CUT OFF ALL CONTACT WITH YOU

01:55.883 --> 01:56.784
BECAUSE OF TAYLOR.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.751
I'M SORRY.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.786
LOOK, KEISHA, WITH THE WAY THAT

01:58.786 --> 02:02.423
I FELT ABOUT YOU, I HAD TO DO

02:02.423 --> 02:04.425
SOMETHING DRASTIC TO TRY TO MOVE

02:04.425 --> 02:05.293
ON.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.327
>> SO NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE

02:06.327 --> 02:08.662
BACK?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.298
>> I'M WAVING THE WHITE FLAG,

02:10.298 --> 02:14.435
KEISHA, AND ASKING TO HAVE MY

02:14.435 --> 02:16.204
FRIEND BACK.

02:16.204 --> 02:16.937
IT'S HARD TO GET YOU OUT OF MY

02:16.937 --> 02:17.871
SYSTEM.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.774
LOOK, I WANT TO MAKE THINGS

02:20.774 --> 02:22.810
RIGHT BETWEEN US.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.345
I'LL START BY FLOATING SOME

02:24.345 --> 02:25.346
BUSINESS YOUR WAY.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.315

02:27.315 --> 02:28.449
>> WELL, I SEE YOU STILL KNOW

02:33.587 --> 02:35.256
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN BEING

02:35.256 --> 02:35.889
THE REALTOR?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.291
>> WELL, I'VE NEVER BEEN ONE TO

02:37.291 --> 02:40.761
TURN DOWN A COMMISSION THAT BIG.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.396
HMM.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.399
I'D DO A GRAND ESTATE AUCTION.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.268
THAT GETS US A MUCH QUICKER

02:47.268 --> 02:48.269
SALE.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.670
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SMART.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.738
>> I KNOW.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.639
IT'S WHAT I DO.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.541
>> THEN IT'S DONE.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.343
YOU GOT THE LISTING.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.577
>> WELL, HOW DOES TAYLOR FEEL

02:56.577 --> 02:57.778
ABOUT YOU WANTING YOUR FRIEND

02:57.778 --> 02:58.479
BACK?

02:58.479 --> 02:59.447
>> I'M GONNA HAVE TO EASE HER

02:59.447 --> 02:59.913
INTO THIS.

02:59.913 --> 03:00.848
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.483
BUT YOU'RE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO

03:02.483 --> 03:03.651
ME THAT I'M WILLING TO PISS HER

03:03.651 --> 03:06.420
OFF TO HAVE YOU BACK IN MY LIFE.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.590
SO ARE WE GOOD?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.463
>> YEAH, UNTIL YOU PISS ME OFF.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.630

03:29.377 --> 03:30.278
PLANS.

03:30.278 --> 03:30.811
>> [sighs]

03:30.811 --> 03:31.979
TOO OBVIOUS?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.447
>> OOH.

03:33.447 --> 03:36.650
THE TEDDY OR YOUR PLANS?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.652
>> I HAVE DECIDED TONIGHT IS THE

03:38.652 --> 03:39.820

03:40.854 --> 03:41.589
[applause]

03:41.589 --> 03:43.457
HOW EXCITING.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.658
THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE WITH

03:44.658 --> 03:46.560
SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT IS ALWAYS

03:46.560 --> 03:48.296
SO SPECIAL.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.298
>> I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.932
I HAVEN'T HAD SEX SINCE DARRYL.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.434
I MEAN, I HAD FUN WITH DR.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.669
VA-JAY-JAY, BUT WE DIDN'T DO IT.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.804
GIRL, IT'S BEEN SO LONG, I'M

03:56.804 --> 03:58.506
LIKE A VIRGIN.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.540
>> AND I'M LIKE, "BITCH,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.742
PLEASE."

04:01.742 --> 04:02.910
>> THANK YOU, KEISHA.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.013
>> SORRY, I COULDN'T RESIST.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.515
>> ME EITHER.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.349
>> HA.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.917
>> DID YOU EVER DRIVE A STICK?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.553
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE NASTY, BUT

04:12.553 --> 04:14.054
I HADN'T DRIVEN ONE IN TEN

04:14.054 --> 04:15.423
YEARS, AND THEN I GOT BEHIND THE

04:15.423 --> 04:18.426
WHEEL, I PUT MY HAND RIGHT UP ON

04:18.426 --> 04:18.992
THAT KNOB--

04:18.992 --> 04:19.660
>> MM-MM.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.761
>> MMM.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.629
>> MM, AND IT ALL CAME BACK TO

04:21.629 --> 04:22.363
ME.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.364
>> [laughs]

04:23.364 --> 04:24.298
>> SO YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T

04:24.298 --> 04:25.766
TRYING TO BE NASTY?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.368
'CAUSE I THINK MY WATER

04:27.368 --> 04:29.036
JUST BROKE.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.338
>> HAVE YOU AND CHARLES BEEN

04:30.338 --> 04:31.572
TAKING ANY RIDES?

04:31.572 --> 04:32.573
>> THE MOMENT HASN'T PRESENTED

04:32.573 --> 04:33.607
ITSELF YET.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.075
BUT I TRUST THE UNIVERSE THAT

04:35.075 --> 04:36.677
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, IT'LL

04:36.677 --> 04:37.745
HAPPEN.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.513
>> WELL, THE UNIVERSE RECENTLY

04:39.513 --> 04:41.482
HOOKED ME UP AT THE LAUNDROMAT.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.583
HIS NAME IS TOM, AND HE'S--

04:42.583 --> 04:43.451
>> [gasps]

04:43.451 --> 04:44.385
>> JUST LOOK.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.354
HERE'S HIS FACEBOOK PICTURE.

04:46.354 --> 04:46.820
>> OOH.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.988
>> OOH.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.523
>> AND THAT'S US BY THE DRYERS.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.724
>> CUTE.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.825
>> I LIKED THE WAY HE HANDLED

04:51.825 --> 04:53.327
HIS DELICATES, SO I ASKED HIM

04:53.327 --> 04:53.961
OUT.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.596
>> WELL, THAT'S COOL.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.531
SO, KEISHA, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU

04:57.531 --> 04:58.399
AND SEAN?

04:58.399 --> 04:59.733
>> JUST BECAUSE YOU GUYS LIKE TO

04:59.733 --> 05:01.335
TELL ALL YOUR BUSINESS DOESN'T

05:01.335 --> 05:03.371
MEAN I DO.

05:08.075 --> 05:08.976
AH.

05:08.976 --> 05:09.643
>> HEY.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.446
>> HEY.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.113
I THOUGHT WE WERE

05:13.113 --> 05:14.415
MEETING AT MY OFFICE LATER.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.617
>> I WAS IN THE AREA, SO I

05:16.617 --> 05:18.085
THOUGHT I'D SAVE A TRIP.

05:18.085 --> 05:18.852
>> OH.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.920
>> AND HERE'S MY PAPERWORK.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.821
>> THANK YOU.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.356
I'LL FAX OVER THE PRELIMINARY

05:22.356 --> 05:23.824
AUCTION INVITE LIST, SO YOU CAN

05:23.824 --> 05:24.792
ADD YOUR PEOPLE.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.661
>> SOUNDS GOOD.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.630
GOOD-BYE, EVERYBODY.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.568
>> UH, EXCUSE ME.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.669
WHAT DID I MISS?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.471
>> YEAH.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.373
I THOUGHT WE HATED HIM.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.641
>> IS HE STILL WITH TAYLOR?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.009
I CAN SEE WHY YOU WANTED TO KEEP

05:42.009 --> 05:43.377
YOUR BUSINESS TO YOURSELF, YOU

05:43.377 --> 05:44.144
HUSSY.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.746
>> NOTHING'S GOING ON.

05:45.746 --> 05:49.049
BUT HE FINALLY APOLOGIZED.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.084
THEN HE GAVE ME A LISTING.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.120
SO BEING THE BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT I

05:53.120 --> 05:54.588
AM, I HAVE IT IN MY HEART TO

05:54.588 --> 05:55.456
FORGIVE...

05:55.456 --> 05:57.458
AND RECEIVE A HEFTY COMMISSION.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.527
HMM.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.961
>> WOW.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.062
EVEN THOUGH YOU GUYS AREN'T

06:02.062 --> 06:03.063
TOGETHER, HE IS STILL TRYING TO

06:03.063 --> 06:03.797
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.399
HE NEEDS TO GET A LIFE.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.834
>> I THINK IT'S ROMANTIC.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.836
LIKE JOE DIMAGGIO AND MARILYN

06:08.836 --> 06:10.638
MONROE, MM-HMM.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.673
EVEN AFTER THEIR DIVORCE, HE WAS

06:12.673 --> 06:14.675
ALWAYS THERE FOR HER, COMING TO

06:14.675 --> 06:16.444
HER RESCUE, CHECKING HER OUT OF

06:16.444 --> 06:17.511
MENTAL INSTITUTIONS.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.712
>> KEISHA, YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO

06:18.712 --> 06:19.747
LOOK FORWARD TO.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.582
>> HE EVEN SENT FLOWERS TO HER

06:21.582 --> 06:23.617
GRAVE TWICE A WEEK UNTIL HE

06:23.617 --> 06:24.518
DIED.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.653
>> Y'ALL ARE TRIPPING.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.688
IT'S NOT THAT DEEP.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.657
HUH?

06:34.628 --> 06:37.097
>> SO I WALK OVER TO THE

06:37.097 --> 06:38.799
BLOCKS, FEELING CONFIDENT.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.167
THEN I LOOK AT THE THREE GIRLS

06:40.167 --> 06:41.635
I'M RACING AND THINK, "PFFT,

06:41.635 --> 06:42.736
I'VE GOT THIS.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.738
THESE BITCHES ARE OUT OF SHAPE."

06:44.738 --> 06:47.541
THAT GUN WENT OFF, AND ALL I SAW

06:47.541 --> 06:49.109
WERE THREE FAT ASSES IN FRONT OF

06:49.109 --> 06:49.777
ME.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.479
>> [sputters] NO WAY.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.513
THEY BEAT YOU?

06:52.513 --> 06:53.180
>> SMOKED ME.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.014
I CAME IN LAST.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.816
I WAS SO EMBARRASSED.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.017
BUT I LEARNED MY LESSON.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.218
>> NOT TO JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS

06:58.218 --> 06:58.886
COVER?

06:58.886 --> 06:59.553
>> MM-MM.

ROMANCE IN BED TOO.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.451
EXCITEMENT.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.552

31:23.115 --> 31:24.050
HE SAID IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.384
