<i>The double ending is okay.
Also, Moonie, watch those breakers.</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:18.244
<i>Very treacherous undertow there.</i>

00:18.485 --> 00:20.647
<i>It's just the
most dramatic thing to come out...</i>

00:20.820 --> 00:22.846
<i>...by the time
you give me another listen.</i>

00:23.723 --> 00:26.352
<i>With all that dynamic
lead guitar playing...</i>

00:26.559 --> 00:28.994
<i>...the drums would make
the best contrast against it.</i>

00:29.162 --> 00:30.755
<i>Being sent to the British Museum.</i>

00:31.831 --> 00:33.993
<i>My resignation, actually.</i>

00:34.167 --> 00:37.001
<i>It's interesting without
being... Picking the word to pieces.</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:39.763
Maybe it's not the right word,
because "irreverence" suggests...

00:40.006 --> 00:42.669
...that you don't give a fuck
about what's already there.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.937
What was interesting is
that I think we all did.

00:46.179 --> 00:48.705
Us, from a...

00:48.915 --> 00:51.146
...middle class
and working class background...

00:51.351 --> 00:55.686
...and our audience being middle and
working class because we were postwar...

00:55.889 --> 00:59.155
...and that that actually meant
that the generation above us...

00:59.359 --> 01:02.124
...had real difficulties engaging with us.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.163
So you'd have terrible trouble
with schoolteachers and stuff.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.891
They would just expect you
to do what they said.

01:08.101 --> 01:11.401
And if you even didn't just...
You know, if you kind of...

01:11.604 --> 01:15.405
It wasn't necessarily you went out
of your way to disobey authority...

01:15.575 --> 01:19.034
...but if you didn't do it in the right
way, they would get angry with you.

01:19.245 --> 01:23.683
So you would end up with,
you know, situations of outright rebellion.

you come in with drums, Moonie, okay?</i>

02:40.660 --> 02:43.186
<i>Cut that, some of it.
Is it all right with you, Pete?</i>

02:44.364 --> 02:47.493
<i>I like your adlib yells and screams,
by the way.</i>

02:47.700 --> 02:49.566

02:54.507 --> 02:56.032
<i>Okay, go.</i>

02:56.709 --> 03:01.647
<i>And this is, like,
'62 or something, '61, '62.</i>

03:01.848 --> 03:04.818
<i>And anyway, I had this sort of, like, um...</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:06.577
<i>...breakdown of some sort, right?</i>

03:06.819 --> 03:10.051
<i>I had, like, a fabulous apartment,
I had a car, you know?</i>

03:10.290 --> 03:15.388
<i>I had this huge sort of career really
moving ahead in the film business...</i>

03:15.595 --> 03:21.034
<i>...and I'm hanging out,
you know, and I'm just dissatisfied.</i>

03:21.234 --> 03:23.567
<i>I didn't really believe
anymore what I was doing.</i>

03:23.803 --> 03:25.237
<i>It became very superficial.</i>

03:25.405 --> 03:27.738
<i>I thought... I was looking
for some sense in myself.</i>

03:27.941 --> 03:30.342
<i>I just hadn't really ever thought
about that before.</i>

03:30.543 --> 03:31.567
<i>And I'm lost, you know?</i>

03:31.811 --> 03:34.838
<i>Anyway, and I'm wandering around
looking, do you know what I mean?</i>

03:35.048 --> 03:39.452
<i>And thinking that, you know,
I need to do something...</i>

03:39.686 --> 03:43.020
<i>...which is more to do with my own
self expression, you know?</i>

03:43.423 --> 03:44.447
And, um...

03:45.024 --> 03:47.186
You know, Kit...
I think a lot about Kit...

03:47.393 --> 03:51.421
...and I miss Kit and, you know,
how we have this sort of thing going on...

03:51.631 --> 03:55.033
It comes and goes. But I'm
basically trying to sort of work out...

03:55.235 --> 03:56.828
...where I am.

03:57.036 --> 03:59.437
<i>I'm reading books that,
like, seem to say things.</i>

03:59.639 --> 04:01.972
<i>Philosophy
and the great novelists and whatever.</i>

04:02.208 --> 04:04.871
I'm seeing these films.
You know, I'm testing...

04:05.078 --> 04:07.445
...you know, my awareness,
my consciousness, right?

04:07.647 --> 04:08.945
I'm listening to jazz.

04:09.148 --> 04:12.949
<i>And I've also now decided
to become a cineaste, right?</i>

04:13.152 --> 04:15.383
<i>I thought you did things...
Like, I became a mod.</i>

04:15.588 --> 04:19.649
<i>You just call yourself that, right? So I'd
gone to see all the films, read all the...</i>

04:19.892 --> 04:22.862
<i>You know, I was voraciously open
to take anything in.</i>

04:23.062 --> 04:29.229
<i>And so I see that the thing
to be in films, right, is a director.</i>

04:30.103 --> 04:32.163
<i>I figured that's the game.</i>

04:32.405 --> 04:34.874
And there's a coffee shop called...

04:35.074 --> 04:37.669
...Act One, Scene 1, right?

04:38.278 --> 04:41.180
<i>That was the name.
It's early in the morning...</i>

04:41.381 --> 04:43.782
...and I go into
the Act One, Scene 1 for a coffee...

04:43.950 --> 04:46.681
...and Kit is sitting in the coffee shop.

04:46.919 --> 04:50.253
So anyway, we meet in this coffee shop,
and it's fantastic to see him...

04:50.456 --> 04:53.426
...and he's very happy to see me,
and we spend the day together.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.391
And at the end of the day...

04:55.595 --> 04:59.032
...we decided that we were gonna
sort of write a screenplay...

04:59.265 --> 05:01.894
...to make a film that would be our film.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.637
<i>I fell in love.</i>

05:06.839 --> 05:10.708
I mean, literally, with both of them
immediately. I mean, I just...

05:10.943 --> 05:15.847
They completely and utterly,
the pair of them, totally changed my life.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.844
That was good. Can I have a look?

05:18.051 --> 05:21.715
<i>However highbrow you want to make
it, I still think there is more valid...</i>

05:21.954 --> 05:24.822
...new creative music
being made at the pop end.

05:25.024 --> 05:28.324
I don't see any good classical composers
emerging at the moment.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.997
I certainly haven't heard
a decent new symphony...

05:31.197 --> 05:33.996
...or a decent new opera
in the last 18 months...

05:34.200 --> 05:36.863
...and I think opera as we know now
is absolutely defunct.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.871
One needs a completely fresh approach
and I think pop's gonna provide it.

05:41.074 --> 05:45.011
You gotta talk to Chris about this. It's a
pity that Kit isn't here to tell his side.

05:45.211 --> 05:48.181
But, you know, how did these two guys
find each other, you know?

05:48.381 --> 05:50.213
I mean, for a while there...

05:50.450 --> 05:54.512
...I thought they must have fallen in love
and had an affair or something.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.053
<i>I couldn't work out
where they'd come together.</i>

05:56.255 --> 05:59.953
<i>I knew they'd worked on films together,
and they loved that about each other...</i>

06:00.159 --> 06:03.755
<i>...that Chris did one thing, Kit did
another. We'd come up with dumb reasons.</i>

06:04.063 --> 06:06.089
Like, you know,
maybe they were lovers...

06:06.332 --> 06:11.100
...or something, but that just made it more
intriguing, you know. More interesting.

06:16.609 --> 06:19.101
<i>This memory came up
that I was being carried.</i>

06:19.345 --> 06:22.213
<i>I think I was being carried
by my Aunt Maude, ahem...</i>

06:22.415 --> 06:27.581
<i>...and my mother, and I guess my brother.
And we went into what was called...</i>

06:27.787 --> 06:30.882
<i>...an Anderson air-raid shelter.</i>

06:31.190 --> 06:35.719
<i>You know, I played, as a kid on,
you know... In the bomb sites.</i>

06:35.928 --> 06:37.021
<i>That's what we did.</i>

06:37.230 --> 06:40.428
<i>We played in the bomb sites,
in the half bombed-out houses.</i>

06:40.633 --> 06:45.367
<i>We liked to smoke and, you know,
do those very young things.</i>

06:45.571 --> 06:47.540
<i>So life was very quick.</i>

06:47.740 --> 06:52.405
<i>You were very sort of, like, old
in a sense, quite quickly.</i>

06:54.080 --> 06:56.276
<i>We were really different individuals.</i>

06:56.516 --> 07:00.612
<i>Chris, he was always like
a big persona.</i>

07:00.820 --> 07:04.313
<i>You know, he was this rough,
tough, fighting, sort of spiv.</i>

07:04.757 --> 07:09.422
<i>I missed most of his kind of gang years,
you know, because I'd left home.</i>

07:09.629 --> 07:11.894
<i>And then I remember getting a call...</i>

07:12.098 --> 07:15.262
<i>...and having a conversation with
my mother because she was frightened.</i>

07:15.568 --> 07:18.060
<i>I think police had brought him home.</i>

07:18.304 --> 07:23.834
And so I was aware that I had to bridge
a lot of water that had come between us.

07:24.076 --> 07:27.672
And the initial thing
was just getting him to admit...

07:27.914 --> 07:32.284
...or getting him to acknowledge
that he did have an interest.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.421
In my conversation with him,
there was this kind of lethargy...

07:35.621 --> 07:38.420
...like he just wasn't interested
in anything.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.115
<i>I had found something.</i>

07:40.326 --> 07:42.989
<i>Unbeknownst to him and the family...</i>

07:43.196 --> 07:46.792
...I had found this thing
to be an actor, and then, finally...

07:46.999 --> 07:48.797
...he confessed that...

07:49.001 --> 07:51.129
When I, you know, pressed him...

07:51.337 --> 07:53.363
...he said he was interested in girls.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.007
That's what he was interested in, girls.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.973
And so I said, "What kind of girls?"

07:58.177 --> 08:00.146
"Well, you know...

08:00.947 --> 08:03.382
...dancing girls." And that came to me...

08:03.616 --> 08:06.984
...the ballet, because I thought,
"God, if you're interested in chicks...

08:07.186 --> 08:09.485
...working backstage at the ballet...

08:09.689 --> 08:14.184
...is the place where a young East End
hobbidy wants to be, you know?"

08:14.494 --> 08:18.829
<i>And I knew from my experiences
that most of those girls were just dying...</i>

08:19.031 --> 08:22.229
<i>...for somebody like Chris
to fall across their path, you know.</i>

08:22.468 --> 08:25.233
And if you worked backstage
in the ballet...

08:25.471 --> 08:29.135
...they're there and they'll love you.
You know, you just gotta be there.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.736
<i>And I stand on the side of the stage...</i>

08:32.979 --> 08:35.380
<i>...looking for all these
amazing women.</i>

08:35.615 --> 08:39.347
<i>And then the orchestra starts to tune up
and I hear this music.</i>

08:39.885 --> 08:43.482
<i>And then the lights come on
and then the show begins, and then...</i>

08:43.688 --> 08:45.555
<i>...these people are just dancing...</i>

08:45.758 --> 08:49.991
<i>...and it's the lights, you know,
and it's so, like, gigantic to me.</i>

08:50.196 --> 08:55.635
The show is about another half hour to go
and this old prop guy comes up to me.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.566
"And so you haven't got any more cues.
You can go home now."

08:58.771 --> 09:01.536
I said, "No, no, no! I'm not leaving."

09:01.741 --> 09:07.078
And that night, I mean,
I absolutely know that whatever this was...

09:07.246 --> 09:09.374
...um, I wanted in.

09:09.916 --> 09:13.876
<i>I'm now, like, a second A.D.
or second assistant, right?</i>

09:14.086 --> 09:18.524
<i>And Kit, he's in the same position
as I am...</i>

09:18.724 --> 09:21.751
<i>...and in the studio we bump into
each other, as you do, right...</i>

09:21.961 --> 09:23.452
<i>...when you're a runner, an A.D.</i>

09:23.663 --> 09:26.155
<i>We used to go to the cafeteria
together at lunchtime...</i>

09:26.365 --> 09:28.561
<i>...and we discovered
we had exactly the same...</i>

09:28.768 --> 09:32.296
I had the same as him,
in terms of French cinema...

09:32.538 --> 09:34.803
...you know, certain types of films
that we liked.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.203
<i>So that began the relationship.</i>

09:37.410 --> 09:42.041
<i>He said he'd met this guy,
he was very smart, and different to him...</i>

09:42.248 --> 09:45.116
...but they kind of were
a very good duo.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.720
They complemented each other,
like two and two made six.

09:48.921 --> 09:54.622
And that they'd had this idea where
they could never really make that jump...

09:54.827 --> 09:57.319
...from being film assistants
to being film directors.

09:57.563 --> 09:59.122
You know, it was impossible.

09:59.332 --> 10:04.566
Their idea was that they would find
a rock 'n' roll group.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.137
They would find a really good
rock 'n' roll group...

10:07.340 --> 10:09.605
...and they would manage them.

10:09.809 --> 10:12.278
And they would make them
so successful...

10:12.478 --> 10:15.846
...that they would be able
to direct a film about them.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.108
And then that film
would be their showpiece.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.582
That film would be their entrée...

10:20.786 --> 10:24.245
...into the world of film directing.
And he did tell me about the idea...

10:24.457 --> 10:29.919
...and before they met The Who, or
The High Numbers as they were called.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.860
<i>Kit, he'd been in the army,
he'd gone to Oxford...</i>

10:33.099 --> 10:38.367
<i>...and he'd also then gone from Oxford
to some cinema school in Paris, right?</i>

10:38.604 --> 10:41.836
<i>All of that stuff that I thought was
fantastic because none of that...</i>

10:42.041 --> 10:45.500
<i>...was even in my viewpoint. We didn't
know that you could go to college...</i>

10:45.745 --> 10:49.648
<i>...where I came from. We weren't told.
Then the fourth thing I knew about Kit...</i>

10:49.815 --> 10:52.785
...was that he had gone to Brazil...

10:52.985 --> 10:56.649
...with an explorer to film...

10:56.856 --> 10:58.051
...and he was actually...

10:58.290 --> 11:01.994
So, he was, like,
a guy who'd held a camera, right?

11:02.128 --> 11:04.791
<i>He's gone to Brazil
because it was a chance to film...</i>

11:04.997 --> 11:08.559
<i>...and because he was a reckless,
impulsive, sort of great guy, right?</i>

11:08.834 --> 11:11.565
<i>The Iriri River was the longest river...</i>

11:11.804 --> 11:14.467
<i>...in the world
that had never been descended in full.</i>

11:14.674 --> 11:19.908
You could go about a thousand kilometers
in any direction and meet nobody.

11:20.146 --> 11:23.913
Just as though it was an island
out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

11:24.150 --> 11:27.018
<i>Kit wanted to come.
I even thought it was great...</i>

11:27.219 --> 11:30.553
...because he was thinking
of making a career in filmmaking.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.350
<i>And he came along
as the cameraman.</i>

11:34.994 --> 11:39.193
He was very tough
and, um, uncomplaining.

11:39.398 --> 11:43.062
Because it became quite
a tough expedition.

11:43.302 --> 11:48.104
Much, much harder than we realized
it was going to be.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.873
<i>Kit had incredible, um, courage.</i>

11:55.081 --> 11:56.572
<i>You know, he had incredible...</i>

11:56.816 --> 11:59.945
<i>He was really always able
to sort of really take risks.</i>

12:00.186 --> 12:03.816
<i>He'd gone to Brazil with
this explorer, this guy called Richard.</i>

12:04.023 --> 12:07.619
And, um, the guy he was with,
they'd gone into an unknown part...

12:07.860 --> 12:09.692
...he got killed by a tribe.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.365
<i>I remember him coming back saying:</i>

12:12.565 --> 12:16.866
<i>"I've just had a radio message that
there's been an attack on your camp."</i>

12:17.269 --> 12:21.604
<i>And, at that time, he said,
"I think five people have been killed."</i>

12:21.841 --> 12:25.835
<i>In fact, it was only one,
and it was an ambush on the trail.</i>

12:26.979 --> 12:31.246
<i>And in a way, I'm incredibly
sort of, you know, in wonder.</i>

12:31.450 --> 12:35.888
<i>It was the possibility that you could do,
you know... It was widening my angle...</i>

12:36.088 --> 12:38.114
<i>...of awareness on possibilities.</i>

12:40.960 --> 12:43.452
Mr. Lambert, Mr. Mason
was an experienced explorer...

12:43.662 --> 12:47.497
...and other members of the party have a
lot of experience of this kind of country.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.931
What went wrong on this expedition?

12:50.136 --> 12:53.231
Well, the verdict of the Brazilian
authorities was that it was:

12:54.673 --> 12:56.471
Pure fate.

12:56.675 --> 12:58.234
<i>We end up living together, right?</i>

12:58.444 --> 13:01.243
So we're in the same apartment,
and then...

13:01.447 --> 13:05.475
...we start to try and write screenplays,
right? We started coming up with ideas.

13:06.986 --> 13:09.785
<i>And then we got round to sort of
what we really both liked.</i>

13:09.989 --> 13:13.016
<i>We got round to this whole
sort of Jean-Luc Godard...</i>

13:13.259 --> 13:15.387
<i>...cinema verité type of thing...</i>

13:15.594 --> 13:18.496
<i>...and we realized that that's
really where we should go.</i>

13:18.697 --> 13:21.599
That's when I came up with the idea
of the rock 'n' roll thing.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.761
We could manage a group,
and how we did it...

13:25.971 --> 13:28.600
...would be the theme of the film.
How we managed them.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.640
<i>We'd shoot it all
as we were doing it...</i>

13:30.843 --> 13:34.780
<i>...and that we would film
the whole process of the managing...</i>

13:34.980 --> 13:38.542
<i>...and the idea of, like, finding
the group, working with them...</i>

13:38.784 --> 13:41.151
<i>...making records,
becoming successful...</i>

13:41.353 --> 13:44.551
<i>...would be filmed,
the whole process on all levels.</i>

13:44.790 --> 13:48.818
<i>Kit and I, we looked everywhere. We
looked all over the place for these bands.</i>

13:49.028 --> 13:52.658
<i>How we defined what group we wanted
to put in our so-called movie...</i>

13:52.865 --> 13:55.494
<i>...was we didn't know
what we wanted...</i>

13:55.668 --> 13:57.728
<i>...but we absolutely knew
what we didn't want.</i>

13:58.037 --> 13:59.938
<i>I mean, we looked for months.</i>

14:00.139 --> 14:04.338
We found the people who were doing
the music to be smart and neat and...

14:04.543 --> 14:06.705
They were very,
like, jumping up and down.

14:06.946 --> 14:10.007
You know,
they weren't what we wanted.

14:10.216 --> 14:13.050
<i>But this we wanted
was really about us.</i>

14:13.986 --> 14:18.185
<i>But it was gonna be some
mad fucking concoction of stuff...</i>

14:18.390 --> 14:20.450
<i>...that looked like Lambert and Stamp.</i>

14:23.095 --> 14:25.587
<i>What we did with
the Railway Hotel, the Railway Club...</i>

14:25.998 --> 14:29.491
<i>...it was a sort of a institutional pub
kind of place.</i>

14:29.702 --> 14:32.194
<i>It was a bit sordid and grotty
like they all are.</i>

14:32.404 --> 14:35.966
<i>So we blacked out all the windows,
we turned all the radiators up...</i>

14:36.175 --> 14:39.270
<i>...and we took all the light bulbs out
and put in pink or red ones.</i>

14:39.511 --> 14:42.106
<i>So it was dark. It was hot.</i>

14:42.348 --> 14:44.977
<i>The band were loud.
We had too many people in.</i>

14:45.184 --> 14:47.119
<i>It was fantastic. It was a real success.</i>

14:47.353 --> 14:51.518
Things were going well,
and one day I'm there on the door...

14:51.724 --> 14:55.092
...and The High Numbers are playing.
I think someone came and said:

14:55.261 --> 14:58.857
"There's some straight guy
poking around outside."

14:59.064 --> 15:04.025
Now, we used to have in the club
500 people or something, you know?

15:04.236 --> 15:08.003
<i>We were officially only allowed 180,
but I suddenly thought:</i>

15:08.207 --> 15:11.302
"Christ, it might be the local council."
It was trouble.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.872
This was Kit Lambert.
I mean, I didn't know.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.743
<i>He's been driving around and he's seen
this line of scooters and mods, you know.</i>

15:17.950 --> 15:20.545
<i>He'd been looking for a band
to put into a film.</i>

15:20.753 --> 15:22.654
<i>Been looking for months
with his partner.</i>

15:22.821 --> 15:25.791
<i>And the first thing he said to me:
"Is it always like this?"</i>

15:26.091 --> 15:29.027
I said, "No, no, it's a special night."
Or something like that.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.823
Anyway, he forced his way
past me, I think...

15:32.064 --> 15:35.933
...and looked inside
and he looked really shaken.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.400
And, you know, he's...
And I'm going, I thought:

15:38.604 --> 15:42.837
<i>"This is it." And he said,
"I'm looking to hire a band."</i>

15:43.242 --> 15:45.802
<i>And I thought,
We went in, we watched the band a bit...</i>

15:45.978 --> 15:47.537
<i>...then we went upstairs to talk.</i>

15:47.746 --> 15:51.080
Lambert says later, when he went,
he said it was like going into hell...

15:51.283 --> 15:54.412
<i>...or a version of Hades or something.
He said it was pitch black...</i>

15:54.620 --> 15:57.055
...very loud.
The band were doing feedback.

15:57.256 --> 15:59.487
Pete was just getting into
his feedback stuff.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.491
And he said all these mods
were doing these dances...

16:02.695 --> 16:05.096
<i>...and he said
they looked mesmerized...</i>

16:05.431 --> 16:07.195
<i>...and just what he wanted.</i>

16:07.433 --> 16:08.492
<i>Up his street.</i>

16:14.940 --> 16:18.069
<i>Yeah, I do remember him.
I remember the night that he was there.</i>

16:18.277 --> 16:21.679
<i>I remember Barney coming
and saying to me, after the show...</i>

16:21.880 --> 16:24.315
...that there was somebody
that had seen the band...

16:24.516 --> 16:26.815
...that was interested
in making a film about us.

16:27.453 --> 16:31.151
<i>They were just
an extraordinary flash of...</i>

16:31.357 --> 16:35.021
<i>I just felt a sense of serenity
about them, of calmness.</i>

16:35.227 --> 16:37.492
Of Kit smoking...

16:37.696 --> 16:42.134
...and not really addressing
the band very much. Kit didn't...

16:43.135 --> 16:45.832
...immediately engage with the band.

16:46.038 --> 16:49.236
He seemed to be like somebody
who had a big idea and was...

16:50.042 --> 16:53.501
<i>I felt like we were actors in his play.</i>

16:53.712 --> 16:57.171
There were two guys here,
assistant directors in the film business.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.182
They were prepared to give all that up
and manage the band.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.652
And put some money into it.
I think they lied about the money.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.685
It was an interesting time.
I was at art school.

17:06.892 --> 17:09.020
<i>The other guys were in day jobs.</i>

17:09.228 --> 17:13.689
<i>Our group, The High Numbers,
we hadn't really...</i>

17:13.999 --> 17:16.366
<i>We hadn't really got our heads
sorted out properly.</i>

17:16.835 --> 17:19.134
<i>We were still struggling
to find an image...</i>

17:19.338 --> 17:22.001
<i>...and find our feet and...</i>

17:23.142 --> 17:25.873
We wouldn't have been
particularly impressive. Um...

17:27.246 --> 17:31.946
We had a few gimmicks. You know, Keith
had an extraordinary look about him.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.551
In fact, you can see the movie
of the event.

17:34.953 --> 17:39.254
<i>They shot the first film
of the band at that gig...</i>

17:40.025 --> 17:43.154
<i>...and took us over then.
Their original intention, you know...</i>

17:43.362 --> 17:45.854
...was to make a movie,
not to manage a band.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.967
But they ended up doing both.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.193
<i>♪ Ooh poo pah do ♪</i>

17:51.937 --> 17:54.406
<i>♪ Well, baby, call me the most ♪♪</i>

17:54.606 --> 17:56.905
<i>I think they got to know the band...</i>

17:57.109 --> 17:59.544
<i>...got to see it,
and got to see the situation...</i>

17:59.745 --> 18:02.044
...and saw the potential.

18:02.247 --> 18:07.481
<i>They saw, probably, that the band really
didn't have any leadership at that time.</i>

18:07.719 --> 18:10.553
<i>And I walked through with Kit...</i>

18:10.756 --> 18:13.920
<i>...towards the front of the stage.
I'm sort of fascinated, you know.</i>

18:14.126 --> 18:17.221
<i>I'm picking up what their audience...
This is their audience, right?</i>

18:17.429 --> 18:19.193
<i>And the atmosphere was just rich.</i>

18:19.631 --> 18:22.829
<i>You know, you could really feel
an audience, an atmosphere here...</i>

18:23.001 --> 18:24.333
<i>...although the show is over.</i>

18:24.736 --> 18:26.705
I look at these guys. They're four, like...

18:26.905 --> 18:30.569
<i>You know, they're four complicated,
difficult fucking guys, right?</i>

18:30.776 --> 18:33.075
I can see that, you know?
They're really awkward. Heh.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.110
And I'm thinking, "Yeah."
You know?

18:35.314 --> 18:37.616
And I just, like...
You know, I got that, right?

18:43.589 --> 18:45.717
<i>Chris had got this job...</i>

18:45.924 --> 18:49.019
<i>...as a second assistant...</i>

18:49.261 --> 18:52.288
<i>...on a film called</i>
The Heroes of Telemark.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.764
<i>And he was going to location...</i>

18:55.968 --> 18:58.597
<i>...a long location shoot in Norway.</i>

18:59.037 --> 19:03.304
And he told me that he had been able
to sign this group...

19:03.509 --> 19:06.741
...who they'd rechristened The Who...

19:06.945 --> 19:08.777
<i>...and they'd been able to sign them...</i>

19:08.981 --> 19:11.348
<i>...because they'd offered them
20 quid a week...</i>

19:11.550 --> 19:14.748
<i>...and he was going to go
on location to Norway...</i>

19:14.953 --> 19:18.515
<i>...and he was just gonna live
on the canteen food.</i>

19:18.757 --> 19:23.058
<i>And he'd arranged for his salary
to be sent back to London...</i>

19:23.362 --> 19:26.332
<i>...and that 80 pounds was gonna be
20 quid a week...</i>

19:26.532 --> 19:28.296
<i>...for the four members of The Who.</i>

19:28.500 --> 19:31.060
And I thought that was kind of...

19:32.070 --> 19:35.063
...a landmark, you know?
I thought that was, like, really smart.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.835
<i>So then Kit and I went to their
parents, and the parents loved this...</i>

19:39.044 --> 19:43.846
...because Kit could put on a white shirt,
and he was... He'd been to Oxford.

19:44.049 --> 19:45.881
But we went to the parents...

19:46.084 --> 19:50.715
...and we agreed in the contract
to give them a salary.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.719
- Which the parents loved.
- Right, so...

19:52.925 --> 19:54.393
A guaranteed salary.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.653
I mean, where's this salary
gonna come from?

19:56.862 --> 20:00.355
Well, we wanted to, you know...
We were gonna find it, right?

20:00.566 --> 20:03.434
He was excited about it.
They were kind of potential.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.231
<i>And I said,
"Are they kind of great-looking?</i>

20:08.440 --> 20:11.535
<i>Are they like the Beatles?"
And he said, "Well, not exactly."</i>

20:14.112 --> 20:17.082
He thought they had a look.

20:17.316 --> 20:19.945
So he gets out this photograph
and he shows it to us.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.677
<i>Our hearts sink, and we said:</i>

20:22.888 --> 20:28.384
"Chris, they're so ugly. They're the
ugliest guys. They're not gonna make it.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.586
There's no way
these guys are gonna make it."

20:30.829 --> 20:33.128
- That's right.
- And we picked out which one...

20:33.365 --> 20:34.799
We thought Keith Moon was okay.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.368
- We thought he was cute.
- We thought Roger was okay.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.767
And Chris said,
"That's the one the girls like."

20:39.972 --> 20:44.068
And then... But we said,
"But the other guy with the nose...

20:44.276 --> 20:46.711
- That's right.
- ...it's just not gonna work."

20:54.486 --> 20:57.752
<i>♪ When you move in
Right up close to me ♪</i>

20:57.956 --> 20:59.948
- Do you think we could have...
- Yes.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.117
- ...a conversation with you?
- Yes, yes.

21:02.361 --> 21:05.263
<i>♪ That's when I get the shakes ♪</i>

21:05.464 --> 21:07.660
<i>♪ All over me ♪</i>

21:11.570 --> 21:14.233
<i>♪ Quivers down my backbone ♪♪</i>

21:14.406 --> 21:17.308
<i>It was about putting the ideas
up, seeing what they looked like...</i>

21:17.509 --> 21:19.637
<i>...and trying them out.</i>

21:20.445 --> 21:22.607
<i>We had no idea of what they did
in the music business...</i>

21:22.814 --> 21:25.249
<i>...or what this whole world was about.</i>

21:25.450 --> 21:29.012
We didn't come to the group
as, like, professional managers.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.152
We came with these two guys
who had these ideas...

21:32.391 --> 21:35.190
...and were filmmakers
and wanted to manage.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.892
We never said we knew how to do it.

22:57.008 --> 22:59.739
So we came in
and like, "Hey, forget it, right?

22:59.978 --> 23:02.538
We're gonna do this and that."
They loved that.

23:02.748 --> 23:06.480
They loved us. They... Every idea we
threw at them, you know, they loved us.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.278
- Why?
- I have no idea.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.989
I mean, we... You know, I mean,
Kit was funny.

23:11.189 --> 23:15.024
I was, like, hip. We had a lot of dialogue.
You know, we'd been around the block.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.925
They were sort of like a year younger
than us and, you know, we were like...

23:19.131 --> 23:21.123
Whatever it was.
They thought we were great.

23:21.366 --> 23:24.097
And we were telling them these ideas
about filming and this.

23:24.302 --> 23:26.931
You know,
we were really selling the deal.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.938
And they thought it was fabulous,
and so they all went along with it.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.270
- Um, then I...
- Did you have any idea...

23:32.511 --> 23:34.878
- ...what the fuck you were talking about?
- No.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.517
No, but, I mean, I knew that what
we would do would be fascinating, right?

23:38.717 --> 23:42.017
I told them, you know, we're gonna
film stuff, you know, we're here.

23:42.220 --> 23:46.316
You know, we gotta sort of... I mean, and
I started to sprout off like, you know:

23:46.558 --> 23:50.654
"We're gonna break the fucking iron
stranglehold of the opium of the masses."

23:50.896 --> 23:54.924
I was giving them sort of Trotsky rhetoric
and, you know... Whatever, right?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.898
- They fucking bought all this?
- Yeah.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.798
Well, I don't know if they bought it.

23:59.037 --> 24:02.030
I mean, they thought, "These guys
are fucking out there," right?

24:02.240 --> 24:07.076
We often used to say this will be 18
months to two years, and then it's over.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.645
Nobody believed, you see...

24:08.814 --> 24:12.080
...that that period of pop music
would last very long anyway.

24:12.284 --> 24:18.155
So if you... What I had was this idea
that it would deliberately...

24:18.356 --> 24:19.915
...blow itself up.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.061
You know, which Kit and Chris
were really quite keen on...

24:23.261 --> 24:25.059
...you know, as an idea.

24:25.263 --> 24:27.198
They didn't know
what hit them about ideas.

24:27.365 --> 24:30.494
"We're gonna film everything. We're
gonna sort of create images for you."

24:30.669 --> 24:31.669
You know:

24:33.972 --> 24:36.373
- Like what kind of images?
- Who the fuck knows?

24:36.608 --> 24:38.941
I mean, look, I'm like...
I'm gasping for breath.

24:39.144 --> 24:43.479
I mean, I'm doing the usual
sort of, like, you know, mirrors work.

24:43.682 --> 24:45.014
Balls in the air.

24:45.217 --> 24:48.483
But I had, underneath all this,
you see, I had...

24:48.820 --> 24:51.016
...you know, the purpose, the meaning.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.454
Kit and I, relationship, all those things.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.787
There was an undercurrent
in our personalities that was real.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.396
<i>And I think a lot of it
was the chemistry of the two.</i>

24:59.631 --> 25:03.193
<i>It was the most unlikely partnership,
Lambert and Stamp, you could imagine.</i>

25:03.401 --> 25:06.462
<i>I mean, first of all,
Kit Lambert was very upper class...</i>

25:06.671 --> 25:08.672
<i>...and had this upper-class accent.</i>

25:08.673 --> 25:13.134
It must have been very strange growing up
with that famous father, Constant Lambert.

25:13.478 --> 25:18.246
<i>And all that involvement with all
those sort of aristocratic celebs...</i>

25:18.483 --> 25:21.385
<i>...and highbrow intellectual
musical people.</i>

25:21.620 --> 25:25.682
So, what we are setting out to do is to
assemble a portrait of Constant Lambert...

25:25.891 --> 25:28.326
...viewed through those
who knew him best.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.826
<i>Our search begins in a club
in Wardour Street...</i>

25:31.029 --> 25:33.828
<i>...where a Lambert is still
involved in the making of music.</i>

25:34.032 --> 25:37.730
<i>How does Christopher Lambert, manager
of a pop group, remember his father?</i>

25:37.936 --> 25:42.067
<i>Well, sort of kind, but perhaps
a rather formidable figure in many ways.</i>

25:42.274 --> 25:43.833
Strongly eccentric. I'd say that.

25:44.042 --> 25:48.742
I remember noticing that, children are
very conscious of these things, I suppose.

25:48.947 --> 25:51.439
He would be completely occupied
by his own thoughts...

25:51.683 --> 25:55.279
...and therefore not terribly aware of
sometimes what was going on around him.

25:55.520 --> 25:59.116
I suppose he's the only person alive
to have been driving with somebody...

25:59.291 --> 26:01.726
...who then found themselves
unable to change gear...

26:01.893 --> 26:03.919
...because they couldn't find
the gear lever.

26:04.095 --> 26:06.929
My father had managed
to get it up the leg of his trousers...

26:07.098 --> 26:10.660
...while doing the <i>Times</i> crossword puzzle
on his knee. He was that kind of person.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.963
He didn't talk much about his father.

26:13.204 --> 26:18.165
He... I came into his room at Oxford
in his first year.

26:18.777 --> 26:22.236
<i>And I find him in tears and I said,
"Kit, what's the matter?"</i>

26:22.447 --> 26:26.817
And he said, "I'm just very depressed.
I've been thinking about my father."

26:27.052 --> 26:29.612
And I didn't take it any further.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.949
I let him talk a bit more.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.284
He didn't say anything
particularly revealing.

26:34.593 --> 26:38.052
<i>I remembered that his father
died about three years before.</i>

26:38.263 --> 26:40.698
And also he was gay
and he must have gone through...

26:40.899 --> 26:44.199
...incredible gay period
at public school.

26:44.402 --> 26:47.804
<i>In those days, you see,
I think it was illegal to be gay...</i>

26:48.006 --> 26:51.204
<i>...and they were very open
to blackmail and stuff like this.</i>

26:51.409 --> 26:54.902
<i>And he'd gone to Lancing Public School
which is a private school...</i>

26:55.113 --> 26:56.945
<i>...and he'd been an officer in the army.</i>

26:57.148 --> 27:01.916
<i>He came from this
Oxford-educated theatrical environment...</i>

27:02.120 --> 27:05.318
<i>...that he'd been to all these schools
that we could only dream about.</i>

27:05.523 --> 27:09.460
<i>Kit wouldn't say he was the first
real posh guy I'd ever spoke to...</i>

27:09.661 --> 27:12.426
<i>...but Kit was the only posh guy
I'd ever spoken to...</i>

27:12.631 --> 27:14.930
<i>...that was actually interested in me...</i>

27:15.133 --> 27:18.035
...and wasn't
talking down to me and...

27:19.804 --> 27:22.933
His enthusiasm was inst...
I mean, it was...

27:23.141 --> 27:26.839
You could cut it with a knife.
I mean, it was... It was...

27:27.045 --> 27:29.480
It was out here on him
when he came to you.

27:29.681 --> 27:33.049
It was so warm
and he was just, "Fucking great!"

27:38.523 --> 27:40.492
Well, not very short.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.957
- Up to here?
- Pretty short. No, no, no!

27:43.161 --> 27:46.256
- Why not?
- Further down there, about that far.

27:46.698 --> 27:49.668
- Quarter inch above my eyes like that.
- Quarter.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.030
Not straight, of course. No?

27:52.270 --> 27:53.363
Why's that?

27:53.571 --> 27:54.971
It's all the worry I do.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.405
<i>It took quite a bit of time
to get to know Chris...</i>

27:58.643 --> 28:01.374
...because he was always off
earning the money...

28:01.579 --> 28:02.877
...to pay our wages.

28:03.648 --> 28:06.846
<i>Earning the money for the guitars
that we were smashing basically.</i>

28:07.052 --> 28:09.214
<i>This was the Ace Face.</i>

28:09.421 --> 28:11.890
We were never gonna...
Or I was never gonna be that.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.522
<i>I loved the fact
that he did not give a fuck.</i>

28:16.728 --> 28:19.425
<i>He... You know,
he would not stand on grace.</i>

28:19.664 --> 28:22.190
<i>You know, he wasn't frightened
of authority.</i>

28:22.400 --> 28:26.030
He did not give a monkey's toss
for breaking the rules...

28:26.237 --> 28:27.830
...if the rules were stupid.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.440
<i>Chris Stamp was working-class
in the East End.</i>

28:30.675 --> 28:34.203
<i>His father was a tugboat captain
on the Thames or something like that.</i>

28:34.412 --> 28:38.076
<i>You know, something...
I mean, talk about chalk and cheese.</i>

28:38.316 --> 28:42.219
And it's almost like... You can imagine if
you'd made this up and gone as a...

28:42.420 --> 28:46.858
You know, a sitcom comedy idea, say look,
you've got this upper-class guy...

28:47.058 --> 28:51.257
...whose father is a classical composer.
You got this tugboat captain's son.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.456
You know, working-class...
They get toge... And you go, "No way."

28:54.699 --> 28:58.534
You know what I mean? It wouldn't work.
It... You know, it's too far-fetched.

29:16.554 --> 29:20.616
<i>When Kit and I first agreed
to sort of make the film together...</i>

29:20.859 --> 29:22.760
<i>...we were actually
sharing an apartment.</i>

29:26.865 --> 29:28.458
On the... On the table.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.862
Will anyone listen to me?

29:31.069 --> 29:32.503
Will anyone listen to me?

29:32.737 --> 29:36.572
<i>One of the things that Kit and I
did talk about was class.</i>

29:36.775 --> 29:40.507
<i>The rock thing was moving
in a defiant way...</i>

29:40.945 --> 29:42.470
<i>...in the class system.</i>

29:42.680 --> 29:43.943
<i>Very loud, Keith, now!</i>

29:44.149 --> 29:49.178
<i>We both considered ourselves,
in a sense, outside of class, but of class.</i>

29:49.420 --> 29:51.787
<i>We were incomplete...</i>

29:51.990 --> 29:53.959
<i>...and we both knew that it wasn't like...</i>

29:54.159 --> 29:57.152
<i>...I would sort of have
an inner satisfaction by becoming...</i>

29:57.462 --> 30:01.422
<i>...rich and upper-class, and he knew
that he wouldn't have inner satisfaction...</i>

30:01.633 --> 30:03.329
<i>...by becoming hip and working-class.</i>

30:03.501 --> 30:06.994
<i>But we thought that
there was somewhere within this...</i>

30:07.205 --> 30:09.504
<i>...that would make life
a little bit more...</i>

30:09.707 --> 30:12.973
<i>...you know, like, real-feeling.</i>

30:13.178 --> 30:16.307
<i>You know, like, really feelings,
like, more authentic or something.</i>

30:16.514 --> 30:21.009
<i>And in a lot of ways,
I mean, Kit was the first...</i>

30:22.353 --> 30:25.949
<i>...you know, really meaningful relationship
that I'd ever entered into.</i>

30:26.157 --> 30:28.991
<i>Kit was a man,
but he was a gay man...</i>

30:29.194 --> 30:33.325
<i>...so he had the sort of sensitivity
that I wanted to sort of communicate with.</i>

30:33.665 --> 30:36.567
<i>And I think
that there was a certain safety...</i>

30:36.935 --> 30:39.530
<i>- ...in this relationship with Kit.</i>
- You've got to be Chris Stamp.

30:39.737 --> 30:42.434
- You've got to be Chris Stamp.
- The living image.

30:42.640 --> 30:46.702
<i>I wasn't able to communicate
emotionally with a woman, right?</i>

30:46.945 --> 30:48.379
<i>I was naive in that area.</i>

30:48.580 --> 30:51.880
<i>I didn't know how to get into
an emotional relationship with a woman.</i>

30:53.017 --> 30:55.509
<i>So Kit gave me that safety
of being able to go there...</i>

30:55.687 --> 30:58.156
<i>...because it was out in the open,
it was understood.</i>

30:58.323 --> 31:01.316
<i>And as I say for me,
it allowed me, in a sense, to be...</i>

31:01.526 --> 31:05.827
<i>...more risk-taking
emotionally than I had been.</i>

31:06.030 --> 31:08.556
<i>We were both marginalized
sort of, you know...</i>

31:08.766 --> 31:11.565
...me in my class
and him in his gayness.

31:11.769 --> 31:13.863
<i>And he obviously had
some sort of love for me.</i>

31:14.072 --> 31:16.200
<i>So I sort of trusted that.</i>

31:16.407 --> 31:18.273
<i>I'd never risked relationship before...</i>

31:18.710 --> 31:24.013
<i>...and the acceptance on my part,
which was quite a profound acceptance.</i>

31:24.215 --> 31:28.676
<i>You know, my young, stud,
hip image...</i>

31:28.887 --> 31:31.083
<i>...was rallying against
this acceptance of Kit.</i>

31:31.289 --> 31:36.728
<i>What that worked into was the ESP
that we had as a creative force.</i>

31:36.928 --> 31:38.863
<i>So it was a very powerful bond.</i>

31:39.063 --> 31:41.532
<i>Not really quite defined...</i>

31:41.733 --> 31:46.364
<i>...because it was really defined outwardly
in a creative sense with The Who.</i>

31:46.571 --> 31:50.775
Believe me, my mind wasn't that fucking
sophisticated then. But I knew something.

34:02.573 --> 34:06.408
There was this vast impact of teenagers
unifying into this big mass...

34:06.644 --> 34:07.839
...which people call mods.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.413
<i>In marketing,
you're always trying to find...</i>

34:10.648 --> 34:13.708
...some way to get around the fact
that the audience are a problem.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.181
The consumer is a problem.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.356
Well, the way that you stop
the consumer being a problem...

34:18.556 --> 34:20.922
...is you don't give them
what they want.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.425
You allow them to be.

34:24.762 --> 34:26.788
<i>You affirm who they are.</i>

34:27.031 --> 34:29.193
<i>You don't try to change them.</i>

34:29.400 --> 34:32.234
<i>Kit and Chris, they could see...</i>

34:32.437 --> 34:36.431
<i>If I could just give you a picture, there
you are, you're on the stage with a guitar.</i>

34:36.674 --> 34:40.270
And the week before,
from the stage, you would see...

34:40.478 --> 34:43.915
I'll often tell this story. You would see,
you know, the sharp guy.

34:44.114 --> 34:45.549
Bill, the sharp guy.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.911
I love that. Love that. That shirt.

34:48.119 --> 34:49.746
Love those. That jacket.

34:49.954 --> 34:53.254
You go out, you buy yourself a jacket
and shirt like Bill.

34:53.458 --> 34:54.983
Next week, you're on the stage.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.786
Bill, meanwhile, hasn't realized
how cool he looks...

34:57.995 --> 35:01.295
...and is coming in his Dungarees
and his, you know, sweatshirt.

35:01.499 --> 35:04.799
You're on the stage
with Bill's outfit from last week.

35:05.002 --> 35:07.437
Bill then looks at you
and thinks, "Hey."

35:07.638 --> 35:11.734
So he comes back with the shirt and
the jacket but everybody thinks it's you...

35:11.943 --> 35:14.310
<i>...that's influenced Bill,
not the other way around.</i>

35:14.512 --> 35:17.243
<i>So you become
a mirror to the audience.</i>

35:17.448 --> 35:19.940
<i>Kit and Chris watched this happen...</i>

35:20.284 --> 35:23.311
<i>...and started to develop it as a way...</i>

35:23.521 --> 35:26.923
<i>...of harnessing the energy
of the audience...</i>

35:27.125 --> 35:31.586
<i>...which was to empower them, make
them realize how important they were.</i>

35:31.796 --> 35:34.994
I was really uncomfortable with it.
Really uncomfortable.

35:35.233 --> 35:39.671
You know, when we did
our Marquee residency...

35:39.871 --> 35:42.864
<i>...Mike Shaw ran all around London
giving people tickets...</i>

35:43.107 --> 35:45.372
<i>...and he was choosing
sharp-looking people.</i>

35:45.610 --> 35:47.442
<i>So we'd go to play the Marquee...</i>

35:47.678 --> 35:53.276
...and the fucking whole audience is full
of all these unbelievably sharp-dressers.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.478
<i>We had this idea which became
known as the Hundred Faces Club.</i>

35:57.688 --> 36:00.123
<i>We would pick one of these kids...</i>

36:00.324 --> 36:03.988
<i>...and make them official members.
We would tell them they'd get in free...</i>

36:04.195 --> 36:07.131
<i>...and they knew that they were in
this sort of unique thing.</i>

36:07.331 --> 36:12.895
They were able to recognize that synergy
that was going on between the audience.

36:13.137 --> 36:16.972
And the only reason that I was into that,
spotting that, was because, again...

36:17.175 --> 36:23.672
...because of art-school training.
Being told by my teachers, find a patron.

36:23.881 --> 36:27.682
Go out there, find a patron.
Find somebody who will pay you to do art.

36:27.885 --> 36:30.047
And I very, very quickly
realized, you know...

36:30.288 --> 36:33.554
...the point where I was gonna go,
"Enough of this stupid band...

36:33.791 --> 36:35.692
<i>...and of this stupid industry."</i>

36:35.893 --> 36:37.691
<i>Just as I'm looking at my watch...</i>

36:37.895 --> 36:41.388
...in the end, I suddenly think,
"This is my patron. The audience."

36:41.599 --> 36:45.400
Well, Kit and Chris took it further.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.663
They're not just the patrons.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.535
They're the essence.

36:50.741 --> 36:54.803
And they are the people.
You don't market to them.

36:55.012 --> 36:57.243
You market them.

36:57.748 --> 37:00.718
<i>And we never quite knew
what made them a Face.</i>

37:00.918 --> 37:02.443
<i>They had to dance well.</i>

37:02.687 --> 37:06.681
<i>They had to dress weird or well,
in some way showed...</i>

37:06.891 --> 37:09.360
<i>...their rebelliousness,
their individuality.</i>

37:09.560 --> 37:13.725
<i>So we weren't only trying to identify
The Who as such...</i>

37:13.931 --> 37:16.696
<i>...but their specific audience
through our judgment.</i>

37:16.901 --> 37:20.429
<i>We were the guys saying, "This is what
we think The Who audience is."</i>

37:20.638 --> 37:22.231
<i>And we made them
a Hundred Faces member.</i>

37:22.473 --> 37:26.938
<i>- And one of those was Irish Jack.
- I remember like it was yesterday.</i>

37:27.111 --> 37:30.104
<i>He was older than me
and didn't look like a real mod.</i>

37:30.281 --> 37:33.877
<i>As I stood there, I kept looking
at this guy, Kit Lambert.</i>

37:34.085 --> 37:37.783
<i>I couldn't believe Lambert was going to be
the new manager of The High Numbers.</i>

37:37.989 --> 37:40.891
<i>He looked timid
and had a small physique...</i>

37:41.092 --> 37:44.358
<i>...like it had never properly grown
to his full proportions.</i>

37:44.562 --> 37:47.157
<i>He had a scarf
folded over his shoulder...</i>

37:47.398 --> 37:50.232
<i>...and wore a blazer-type
double-breasted jacket.</i>

37:50.434 --> 37:53.893
<i>I shook his hand,
and when he said, "Kit Lambert"...</i>

37:54.105 --> 37:57.098
<i>...he sounded like someone
from the BBC.</i>

37:57.308 --> 37:59.573
<i>He reminded me of an Oxford don...</i>

37:59.777 --> 38:04.875
<i>...and the accent, ridiculous as it was,
suited him down to the ground.</i>

38:05.082 --> 38:07.642
<i>I found myself liking him instantly...</i>

38:07.885 --> 38:11.913
<i>...and I remember being very impressed
when he told me his business partner...</i>

38:12.189 --> 38:14.818
<i>...Chris Stamp,
was currently in Ireland...</i>

38:15.026 --> 38:19.020
<i>...working as an assistant director
on the film</i> Young Cassidy.

38:19.263 --> 38:22.461
Standing next to Kit Lambert,
I felt a rush of excitement...

38:22.800 --> 38:25.531
<i>...as I listened to
his rich Oxford tones...</i>

38:25.770 --> 38:31.107
<i>...while he preached a gospel about The
High Numbers needing a new direction.</i>

38:31.309 --> 38:36.304
<i>I felt Lambert studying me as he dragged
the tar from a small French cigarette.</i>

38:36.514 --> 38:41.282
<i>In the background, 500 mods
stomped in their red nylon socks...</i>

38:41.485 --> 38:44.114
<i>...desert boots
and pink stay-pressed jeans...</i>

38:44.322 --> 38:47.656
...to the Nashville Teens'
"Tobacco Road."

38:47.858 --> 38:50.157
"Which do you think is best?"

38:50.361 --> 38:52.455
Kit Lambert shouted to me
over the din.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.564
"The High Numbers or The Who?"

38:54.799 --> 38:58.702
It was that good, and I hadn't
even met Chris Stamp yet.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.998
Kit thought that The High Numbers
sounded like bingo.

39:02.206 --> 39:05.938
He thought people would think it was
bingo when he was giving out leaflets.

39:06.143 --> 39:09.739
<i>He didn't realize that, for mods,
it meant the numbers were kind of kids...</i>

39:09.980 --> 39:12.711
<i>...and a high number was some
kind of top mod, I suppose.</i>

39:12.950 --> 39:16.944
First, we were gonna change their name.
They'd used the name "The Who" before.

39:17.154 --> 39:19.316
I was back at the flat, and they...

39:19.523 --> 39:21.719
They were in the van,
trying to think of a name.

39:21.959 --> 39:24.554
And they didn't come into the flat
because at the time...

39:24.762 --> 39:27.857
...Pete and I were dope heads.
We were smoking dope at art school.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.592
The others looked down upon it.
Didn't approve.

39:30.768 --> 39:33.465
They were very straight then.
Roger was a factory worker.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.071
John worked in the tax office.

39:35.272 --> 39:37.707
<i>And they thought we were lazy,
no-good, art students.</i>

39:37.908 --> 39:40.503
<i>We were, actually,
but we resented them knowing it.</i>

39:40.711 --> 39:43.909
Anyway, Pete said, "Let's go in
and see if Barney's got any ideas."

39:44.115 --> 39:48.109
So they did come into the flat. It was only
the second time they'd ever been in there.

39:48.285 --> 39:51.221
We made coffee and sit around.
Just coming up with these names.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.757
And I sort of thought, "Imagine what
you'd do if it was The Who"?

39:54.992 --> 39:58.690
<i>You know you'd say, "The Who!" "Who?"
"The Who." You know, corny but it was...</i>

39:58.896 --> 40:00.728
<i>He'd milk it for all it was worth.</i>

40:00.931 --> 40:03.730
<i>There were various other names.
"Nothing" was a great name.</i>

40:03.934 --> 40:05.061
<i>Fantastic sort of name.</i>

40:05.269 --> 40:07.704
<i>At one time, I wanted to call it
"British European Airways"...</i>

40:07.872 --> 40:10.706
<i>...because I'd seen it... But I was
so stoned by then, they ignored me.</i>

40:10.908 --> 40:14.743
And the other name in contention was
"The Hair," which was also a good name.

40:14.945 --> 40:16.607
Then Pete came up
with the idea of saying:

40:16.814 --> 40:18.646
"Let's call it 'The Hair and The Who.'"

40:18.883 --> 40:20.749
"That sounds like a pub."

40:20.951 --> 40:23.250
It was a terrible name. Absolutely awful.

40:23.454 --> 40:26.583
<i>And we left it like that, and then
what happened the next day...</i>

40:26.791 --> 40:29.590
<i>...when Roger came around
to pick us up, he just said:</i>

40:29.794 --> 40:33.595
"It's 'The Who, ' isn't it?" So that
was it. Anyway, "The Who" worked.

40:33.798 --> 40:36.825
First of all, it looked good on posters.
It was massive.

40:37.067 --> 40:40.060
We wanted to use that name
because we wanted it to be a name...

40:40.271 --> 40:41.762
<i>...anything could be written on.</i>

40:42.273 --> 40:44.071
Then he thought it wasn't long enough.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.972
I thought he got rid of The High Numbers
because it was long.

40:47.178 --> 40:50.945
He said, "It's not long enough.
We gotta have a longer name."

40:51.148 --> 40:53.777
Then he came up with a masterstroke
where he called it:

40:53.984 --> 40:56.852
<i>"The Who, Maximum R&B."</i>

40:57.087 --> 41:01.183
They had this on these black-and-white
posters that were made for the Marquee...

41:01.425 --> 41:05.157
...with Pete swinging his arm, and that's
when they came up with this logo...

41:05.362 --> 41:07.854
<i>...with The Who with
an arrow symbol for a male...</i>

41:08.098 --> 41:11.796
...and with the arrow coming out the O,
which people think I came up with.

41:12.002 --> 41:15.268
People say, "You designed that."
I say, "I wish I had. I didn't."

41:15.473 --> 41:17.806
<i>I thought it was great,
to turn it back to The Who.</i>

41:18.008 --> 41:19.476
<i>Which was fantastic,
because I thought of it.</i>

41:19.677 --> 41:22.613
<i>We're trying to define,
you know, what their image is.</i>

41:22.813 --> 41:26.079
And also, we were very constricted.
We had no money.

41:26.283 --> 41:27.478
We had no money at all.

41:27.685 --> 41:31.884
So we were trying to be as clever
with bank managers giving us loans...

41:32.122 --> 41:36.184
...and running up sort of enormous debt
with tailors and winemakers.

41:36.393 --> 41:39.295
Whatever it was, right?
We were trying to do all these things...

41:39.497 --> 41:41.363
How did you plan
to back any of this up?

41:41.699 --> 41:44.032
How did you plan to back this up?
Pay for it?

41:44.201 --> 41:47.797
Well, we thought... We just had absolute
belief in ourselves, right? Heh.

41:50.007 --> 41:53.000
- Where's Pete, Kit?
- I have absolutely no idea.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.406
- We're gonna find him.
- He rang off.

41:55.646 --> 41:57.877
<i>There were not probably
two guys on the planet...</i>

41:58.115 --> 42:01.552
...that knew less about rock
than these two, but you felt...

42:01.752 --> 42:03.914
...the... And they had no connections.

42:04.154 --> 42:06.988
Little doctor
in Wimpole Street called Artemis.

42:07.558 --> 42:09.754
Has it to do with venereal disease,
do you know?

42:09.994 --> 42:11.485
No, no, no.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.254
This fella called...

42:13.497 --> 42:15.625
This fella Chris Stamp
introduced me to him.

42:15.833 --> 42:19.929
<i>First of all, we wanted to find out
if they did any songwriting.</i>

42:20.170 --> 42:23.572
And Pete said,
"Well, I've written one song."

42:24.008 --> 42:25.636
And we said that will do.

42:28.345 --> 42:30.075
<i>If you can write one, right?</i>

42:30.281 --> 42:35.584
Kit soon saw in that band that, really, the
two stars in it were Pete and Keith Moon.

42:35.786 --> 42:38.278
They were the two,
and he nurtured those two...

42:38.522 --> 42:40.684
<i>...quite clumsily,
at the expense of the others.</i>

42:40.891 --> 42:44.658
<i>And Roger, for one, I think resented it,
quite rightly because he got a bad deal.</i>

42:44.862 --> 42:46.888
<i>It was Roger's band.
He was the leader.</i>

42:47.097 --> 42:50.534
<i>So, what happened when
the music thing started with Pete...</i>

42:50.734 --> 42:53.067
...something came out of Kit
that was always there.

42:53.270 --> 42:54.270
Right.

42:54.471 --> 42:55.700
But he hadn't owned that.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.740
- That was very good.
<i>- Suddenly, he could talk to Pete...</i>

42:58.943 --> 43:01.276
<i>...about song construction...</i>

43:01.478 --> 43:04.209
- It's the quiet bit...
<i>- ...and just those ideas.</i>

43:04.415 --> 43:07.180
<i>So he brought to this relationship
with Pete...</i>

43:07.384 --> 43:10.218
<i>...the newness of his acceptance
of his musical heritage...</i>

43:10.421 --> 43:13.323
<i>...and the beginning
of Pete's understanding...</i>

43:13.557 --> 43:17.551
<i>...that he was able to be
a musician and a composer.</i>

43:17.761 --> 43:23.393
<i>Pete just suddenly became like a really
fabulous fucking writer, you know?</i>

43:23.601 --> 43:24.625
<i>They were our managers.</i>

43:24.835 --> 43:26.804
<i>Then things really started to change.</i>

43:27.338 --> 43:31.241
Their ideas were fantastic,
and that's all I cared about was this band.

43:31.442 --> 43:35.937
<i>All I ever wanted to do was
make this band successful.</i>

43:38.415 --> 43:40.577
<i>And they, literally,
had a map of England.</i>

43:40.784 --> 43:44.482
And they would stick... "Gonna play there,
gonna play there, gonna play there.

43:44.722 --> 43:48.284
<i>And we're gonna get these posters,
and gonna do that, gonna do that."</i>

43:48.492 --> 43:49.858
<i>Just like planning a battle.</i>

43:56.333 --> 44:00.668
<i>It was just... It was like being
caught in a whirlwind of ideas of...</i>

44:00.838 --> 44:02.773
<i>...how to get noticed.</i>

44:03.874 --> 44:07.606
<i>♪ Took me three years of sweating blood
To clean off all that Tennessee mud ♪♪</i>

44:07.811 --> 44:10.337
<i>For that period, The Who was the...</i>

44:10.547 --> 44:13.107
<i>...Kit Lambert, stroke,
Pete Townshend Who.</i>

44:13.317 --> 44:16.446
<i>I know Roger probably wouldn't like that,
but there's definitely...</i>

44:16.620 --> 44:18.782
<i>The Who went in this direction
of writing this...</i>

44:18.989 --> 44:20.514
<i>Having Pete Townshend's songs.</i>

44:20.758 --> 44:23.250
<i>And very much inspired
by Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp.</i>

44:23.460 --> 44:27.488
Kit started nurturing him and taking him
and Keith to posh restaurants...

44:27.698 --> 44:31.135
...and introducing them to French wine
and so on, and all the rest of it.

44:31.335 --> 44:34.328
And this is where Keith
developed this "dear boy" thing.

44:34.538 --> 44:36.006
"Dear boy." He got it from Kit.

44:36.206 --> 44:40.041
I have to be honest about this. I do feel
that I was treated differently by them...

44:40.277 --> 44:42.269
...to the other guys in the band.

44:43.681 --> 44:46.014
I felt valued, you know?

44:46.216 --> 44:49.414
I was the one that was taken
and moved from their apartment...

44:49.653 --> 44:53.681
...to a flat in Belgravia, you know? Um...

44:54.858 --> 44:56.690
Keith Moon was left to, you know...

44:56.894 --> 44:59.386
...struggle out in Wembley,
where he came from.

44:59.596 --> 45:01.497
Kit came once
to have a photograph.

45:01.699 --> 45:04.726
I was having my photograph taken
for a teen magazine...

45:04.935 --> 45:08.565
...at the apartment I shared with Barney,
and he went around, looked around...

45:08.806 --> 45:10.672
...and immediately said,
"You've gotta get out of here."

45:10.874 --> 45:14.003
<i>He knew Pete was the one that
would write the songs, he needed to...</i>

45:14.211 --> 45:16.908
...kind of become his muse or whatever
and encourage him.

45:17.114 --> 45:19.379
Pete and I were living together,
and Pete said:

45:19.583 --> 45:21.882
"Kit wants me to go
and move into his place."

45:22.086 --> 45:23.918
I said, "All right." And he moved away.

45:24.121 --> 45:28.320
Why did they move you in with them?

45:28.525 --> 45:29.549
What was the...?

45:29.760 --> 45:32.195
I think the, um...

45:33.630 --> 45:37.863
They felt... I mean, you know...
You really have to ask Chris.

45:38.068 --> 45:40.333
<i>But I... The message
that I got that I felt...</i>

45:40.537 --> 45:45.373
...was it was nurturance, and in a sense,
trying to draw me away...

45:45.576 --> 45:46.976
...from the art-school crowd.

45:47.211 --> 45:49.544
He'd come to our flat,
it was just blues records...

45:49.747 --> 45:51.716
...dark, red light bulbs, smoking dope...

45:51.915 --> 45:55.613
...people hanging about, you know?
He didn't like it. Well, I don't know...

45:55.853 --> 45:59.153
And Pete said, "What he wants is,
he wants to take me away...

45:59.389 --> 46:02.655
...from the squalor that is ours
to the squalor that is his.

46:02.893 --> 46:05.226
His upper-class,
posh Belgravia squalor."

46:05.429 --> 46:08.797
<i>We moved from one apartment
to another apartment, Kit and I.</i>

46:08.999 --> 46:12.231
<i>So we wanted an apartment that would
have a lot of good credit rating.</i>

46:12.436 --> 46:13.665
We had absolutely no money.

46:13.904 --> 46:17.432
We wanted to move to an area of London
where you could get things delivered.

46:17.641 --> 46:20.236
They'd deliver stuff with credit
because of where you lived.

46:20.444 --> 46:24.438
<i>Kit would be teaching us
how to get by with no money.</i>

46:24.648 --> 46:28.016
Which, you know, the aristocracy,
they're educated in it.

46:28.252 --> 46:31.654
I mean, they're, you know,
absolutely expert at it.

46:31.889 --> 46:34.449
You know,
I've had an account at...

46:34.658 --> 46:38.026
...Stone's Wine Shop in Belgravia...

46:38.262 --> 46:41.960
...since I was 20.

46:42.166 --> 46:43.498
They've never sent me a bill.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.965
Whenever I go there
and buy wine, if I need any...

46:46.170 --> 46:49.004
I don't drink wine anymore...
But if I need wine for a party.

46:49.206 --> 46:52.973
They say, "Should we put it on account?"
I say, "Do you want me to pay this?"

46:53.177 --> 46:55.146
"Don't worry, sir."

46:55.846 --> 46:58.145
It still goes on.
So I think there was that.

46:58.348 --> 47:00.340
That sense of arriving in this place.

47:00.551 --> 47:02.782
And Kit was very, very
transparent about it.

47:02.986 --> 47:05.979
He said, "You know, we need
to have an address in Eaton Place...

47:06.190 --> 47:08.682
...because then we won't ever
have to pay our bills."

47:10.160 --> 47:11.958
I was living in the back of the van...

47:12.162 --> 47:15.064
...but now I got a girlfriend.
She didn't quite like the back of the van.

47:15.299 --> 47:18.326
Heh. So she preferred
the couch of the office.

47:18.535 --> 47:20.561
The Who would do a gig, right?

47:20.804 --> 47:23.672
You know, and we would get,
like, for the gig...

47:23.874 --> 47:27.174
...60 pounds, or 50 pounds, right?

47:27.377 --> 47:29.812
Or 30 pounds.
Really small amounts of money, right?

47:30.013 --> 47:32.539
- Right.
- And Kit would figure, "Hey...

47:33.016 --> 47:36.009
...if I take the 30 pounds
to play blackjack...

47:36.220 --> 47:38.382
...I might come out
with a couple of hundred...

47:38.589 --> 47:41.889
...but if we stay with 30, that's not gonna
pay for very much anyway."

47:43.827 --> 47:45.523
So that was one of the systems.

47:45.729 --> 47:48.893
That was a sort of like...
That didn't happen a lot...

47:49.099 --> 47:50.897
...but that was one of the systems.

47:51.101 --> 47:52.535
We had many systems.

47:52.736 --> 47:55.570
<i>I loved it there.
I loved living with Kit...</i>

47:55.772 --> 47:59.038
...because he was passionate, and...

47:59.243 --> 48:01.906
And it was a fantastic
fucking apartment too.

48:02.112 --> 48:05.082
Big, high ceilings
in Eaton Place, you know?

48:05.282 --> 48:08.275
And you'd get in a taxicab, and he'd say,
"Where you going, kid?"

48:08.518 --> 48:09.747
You go, "84 Eaton Place."

48:09.987 --> 48:11.580
He'd go, "Ooh. Ooh."

48:11.755 --> 48:12.755
You know?

48:12.990 --> 48:15.858
<i>You could go into any bank
account and say, "I want to write... "</i>

48:16.059 --> 48:19.518
<i>Coutts or one of these sort of banks,
And say, "I want to open an account."</i>

48:19.730 --> 48:21.631
Dress, and with your accent,
"Eaton PI..."

48:21.865 --> 48:23.356
"Of course, sir."
"And I want an overdraft.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.627
I want a 5000 pound overdraft."
"Of course."

48:25.869 --> 48:28.896
Because they started doing this,
it's what they called...

48:29.106 --> 48:30.699
First one they did it with
was the Bank of Scotland.

48:30.908 --> 48:35.073
And Stamp, they run up this... Write all
the checks up, spend all the money...

48:35.279 --> 48:38.807
...and then skip without paying it back
and open another one.

48:39.049 --> 48:41.780
Stamp used to say, "We're gonna
do another Bank of Scotland job."

48:42.252 --> 48:44.244
<i>And then I also had an older brother...</i>

48:44.454 --> 48:46.650
<i>...who'd become
a successful film actor.</i>

48:46.890 --> 48:49.826
<i>Yeah, it was... He was certainly
making a lot of money, you know?</i>

48:50.060 --> 48:52.052
<i>So he... I would go to him
to get money.</i>

48:52.262 --> 48:53.958
Yeah. I mean, look. We were brothers.

48:54.164 --> 48:58.295
I mean, he didn't just give it to me freely.
I had to sort of promise to pay it back.

48:58.535 --> 49:00.629
Pete said, "I was living there.
Every now and again...

49:00.837 --> 49:03.033
...these teenage boys
would appear at breakfast.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.835
Kit would say, 'This poor boy.
I found him in the street.

49:06.076 --> 49:07.567
Had nowhere to stay.
I said he could stay.'"

49:07.778 --> 49:10.338
Like I say, that fearless quality
because he was...

49:10.580 --> 49:13.106
You know, to be homosexual in...

49:13.317 --> 49:15.616
In those years in London was illegal.

49:15.819 --> 49:19.620
I was in the bedroom next to his,
looking to offer him tea in the morning...

49:19.823 --> 49:21.917
...and there'd be
some boy in bed with him.

49:22.125 --> 49:25.493
But he never once
tried to seduce me...

49:25.696 --> 49:28.996
...and I remember feeling quite
pissed off at one point, thinking:

49:29.199 --> 49:30.667
"Aren't I good-looking enough?"

49:30.867 --> 49:32.699
It wasn't that I wanted to be gay.

49:32.936 --> 49:34.768
I thought he should at least
try it on if he's gay.

49:34.972 --> 49:37.498
And I shared the flat with him
at the office.

49:37.708 --> 49:40.439
Mind you, I was with
a beautiful girl as well. Ha-ha-ha.

49:40.644 --> 49:43.079
Maybe she came between us.
Ha-ha-ha.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.681
He'd wear these suits.

49:45.882 --> 49:48.078
Beautiful cut suits from Savile Row...

49:48.285 --> 49:50.982
...but always be like this
and buttoned up wrong.

49:51.188 --> 49:53.123
And they'd all be... And he, I mean...

49:53.323 --> 49:55.883
...I've never known anybody like
Kit to smoke. Chain-smoke.

49:56.126 --> 49:59.460
He'd chain-smoke
Player's or Senior Service.

49:59.663 --> 50:01.723
These were the best cigarettes.
Untipped.

50:01.965 --> 50:03.866
One after the other,
he'd light one from...

50:04.101 --> 50:07.629
We think he used one match in his whole
life to light the very first one.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.603
<i>Kit remembered he was, like, 9...</i>

50:10.807 --> 50:14.744
<i>...when, you know, one of the artists
who his father was fucking or knew...</i>

50:14.978 --> 50:17.470
<i>...or what, you know,
offered Kit his first cigarette.</i>

50:17.681 --> 50:19.240
<i>"Here, you want a cigarette, Kit?"</i>

50:19.483 --> 50:21.884
<i>There was no sort of...
The fact that he was a child.</i>

50:22.119 --> 50:24.384
<i>He'd have cigarettes all over the place.</i>

50:24.621 --> 50:26.988
And also, he was renowned
for setting things alight.

50:27.190 --> 50:31.127
The number of sofas he'd gone through.
In those days, sofas had horsehair.

50:31.328 --> 50:34.856
And he'd always leave cigarettes,
and they'd fall down...

50:35.065 --> 50:36.897
You know,
people would say things like:

50:37.134 --> 50:40.002
"Kit's late, what's happened?"
And they'd say, "Another fire."

51:13.170 --> 51:16.038
And when I started to talk
to Kit about classical music...

51:16.239 --> 51:19.732
...and Baroque music,
he immediately just simply...

51:19.943 --> 51:21.912
He didn't bother to try to educate me.

51:22.112 --> 51:25.549
He just chucked records at me
that were from his father's collection.

51:25.749 --> 51:28.241
So, wow, you know.

51:28.452 --> 51:29.681
Wow, wow, wow.

51:29.886 --> 51:31.479
He started playing classical music.

51:31.721 --> 51:35.453
Purcell and English classical music
that his father had championed.

51:35.692 --> 51:37.718
These... You know, and stuff like that.

51:37.928 --> 51:41.626
And Pete said as a result
of listening to this sort of stuff:

51:41.832 --> 51:45.701
"I developed my chord sounds"
like in "Kids Are Alright."

51:45.902 --> 51:49.464
The middle-chord bit was based on
some particular Purcell...

51:49.706 --> 51:52.073
...or music that Kit had played him.

51:52.275 --> 51:53.971
Because of his father's background...

51:54.211 --> 51:57.238
...he knew that you could add these
three-minute pieces up...

51:57.447 --> 52:00.440
...to make a much more important...

52:00.650 --> 52:02.209
...dramatic piece.

52:02.419 --> 52:03.580
And...

52:03.787 --> 52:07.315
And he had that in him
right from the beginning.

52:07.524 --> 52:09.356
He kept, you know:

52:09.593 --> 52:12.085
He was always trying
to put things in a...

52:12.295 --> 52:15.424
He taught me about the dramatics
of a stage show.

52:15.632 --> 52:18.261
<i>"It has to kind of be like this, Roger."</i>

52:18.468 --> 52:21.304
"Really? What? No.
Yeah, but wait."

52:54.271 --> 52:55.796
My mentoring Kit in the...

52:56.006 --> 53:01.309
In lots of the overview of the content
of the songs that Pete was writing...

53:02.078 --> 53:04.809
<i>...we, the three of us,
were working on that angle...</i>

53:05.015 --> 53:07.644
<i>...with Pete,
how we were staging them...</i>

53:07.851 --> 53:10.878
<i>...how they looked on stage
and how those things developed...</i>

53:11.087 --> 53:12.783
<i>...you know, just fell to me.</i>

53:12.989 --> 53:16.790
And then we had wrongly signed a
sort of standard-type of recording deal...

53:16.993 --> 53:19.326
<i>...because we didn't know
and went into this deal.</i>

53:19.529 --> 53:22.294
<i>And after we'd been in the studio
for about three times...</i>

53:22.499 --> 53:27.437
<i>...with this producer, we realized, wow,
we'd let go of an essential ingredient...</i>

53:27.671 --> 53:30.163
<i>...to the whole process,
which was the studio work.</i>

53:30.373 --> 53:32.740
We had to be in the studio
directing everything.

53:32.943 --> 53:36.004
We couldn't have an outsider doing that.
This guy was an outsider.

53:36.213 --> 53:37.681
He was a professional producer.

53:37.881 --> 53:41.010
Some say he was very clever,
and very good, but he wasn't...

53:41.218 --> 53:44.086
He wasn't part of us.
He wasn't seeing the vision.

53:44.321 --> 53:47.314
<i>But it fell naturally into place.</i>

53:47.524 --> 53:50.050
<i>It wasn't really that talked about
and agreed...</i>

53:50.260 --> 53:54.595
...but the in-the-studio producer
would be Kit...

53:54.831 --> 53:58.427
...and I would become like, the more
overall executive producer in the studio.

53:58.768 --> 54:02.466
<i>We had immediate success.
I mean, we had hit records from day one.</i>

54:02.706 --> 54:08.703
And we were never, ever, um,
financially balanced.

54:08.912 --> 54:11.211
I mean, after we had, like...

54:11.414 --> 54:14.714
...four or five hit records,
we had no money whatsoever.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.284
<i>We were being sued, you know?</i>

54:16.486 --> 54:19.945
<i>There were bailiffs outside the office.
It was absolute chaos financially.</i>

54:20.156 --> 54:24.753
Because every sort of forward move
was another level to sort of challenge.

54:26.296 --> 54:28.458
<i>Because
they'd been in the film industry...</i>

54:28.665 --> 54:32.659
<i>...they understood
how a team of people...</i>

54:32.902 --> 54:36.304
<i>...can change the way that you feel
when you're creative and working.</i>

54:36.506 --> 54:40.910
You know, I didn't want to be
in a band until I was 61.

54:44.147 --> 54:46.776
I wanted to be in a band
for a couple of years, you know?

54:47.117 --> 54:51.646
<i>And I think they convinced me
that, um, it was worth staying with.</i>

54:51.888 --> 54:55.882
<i>Particularly, those years that they were
around and we worked as a team.</i>

54:56.092 --> 54:58.391
<i>The support that they gave me
to try new things...</i>

54:58.595 --> 55:02.623
<i>...was really what made it all last.</i>

55:02.832 --> 55:08.794
But there was another magic, which was
that John Entwistle is a fucking genius.

55:09.005 --> 55:13.841
<i>A fucking genius
on the bass guitar.</i>

55:14.044 --> 55:16.775
<i>I mean, an astonishing fucking genius.</i>

55:17.047 --> 55:20.779
<i>You know, it wasn't something that we
were particularly aware of at the time...</i>

55:20.984 --> 55:24.819
<i>...but Jesus Christ, you know,
what he did was just beyond conception.</i>

55:25.021 --> 55:27.047
<i>And that Keith Moon...</i>

55:27.290 --> 55:29.987
...was not a drummer.

55:31.494 --> 55:33.622
<i>He just wasn't a drummer.</i>

55:33.830 --> 55:36.994
<i>You know? He did something else.</i>

55:37.200 --> 55:39.533
<i>You know? And Roger,
of course, is, you know...</i>

55:39.736 --> 55:42.865
<i>...probably the only
conventional figure in the band.</i>

55:43.073 --> 55:46.669
<i>And for years, for years and years
and years, until</i> Tommy...

55:46.876 --> 55:49.505
<i>...he didn't know what the fuck
he was doing in the band.</i>

55:49.713 --> 55:52.547
<i>He didn't know what to do,
how to behave.</i>

55:52.749 --> 55:55.514
<i>And has turned out to be
one of the great...</i>

55:55.719 --> 55:59.884
...modern interpreters,
editors and frontmen...

56:00.090 --> 56:02.184
...of our business.

56:02.392 --> 56:08.855
Not of the business of what Kit
and Chris recognized in the band.

56:09.165 --> 56:12.465
What they recognized there, that was
what was great about Roger then...

56:12.669 --> 56:15.161
...was the fact that he was lost.

56:15.972 --> 56:18.339
And that would he find himself?

56:18.541 --> 56:20.874
<i>♪ I can go any way ♪♪</i>

56:21.077 --> 56:24.673
<i>Kit and Chris were
used to working and creating teams...</i>

56:24.881 --> 56:26.509
<i>...where everybody had a function.</i>

56:26.716 --> 56:31.848
<i>But that also... I suppose that sense
of there only ever being one director.</i>

56:32.055 --> 56:36.425
<i>That doesn't mean that there's only
one creative person in a team.</i>

56:36.626 --> 56:39.721
<i>It just means you have one person
that has to have the last call...</i>

56:39.929 --> 56:41.727
<i>...because otherwise
you'd have chaos.</i>

56:41.931 --> 56:47.495
<i>And rock bands are, by nature, groups
of creative people with no director.</i>

56:47.704 --> 56:50.572
As soon as somebody says,
"By the way, I'm the director."

56:50.740 --> 56:53.505
He goes, "No, I'm the director."
Or, "No, I'm the director."

56:53.710 --> 56:55.110
It's like gang warfare.

56:55.311 --> 56:58.304
<i>And Roger was still a street fighter
in those days.</i>

56:58.548 --> 57:03.213
He would win arguments by looking
at you, and you got the feeling that:

57:03.420 --> 57:07.118
"If I don't acquiesce to his point of view
right now, he's gonna kill me."

57:07.323 --> 57:09.724
<i>It took quite an amount
of wit and intelligence...</i>

57:09.893 --> 57:14.297
<i>...and also people management
for Kit and Chris to be able to juggle it.</i>

57:15.098 --> 57:18.125
<i>And obviously, they must have
kind of manipulated a bit.</i>

57:18.802 --> 57:21.271
But you know,
like all good manipulators...

57:21.471 --> 57:23.463
...you don't notice
when it's done to you.

57:23.907 --> 57:26.934
Didn't he tell Roger he had to
actually get rid of his first wife?

57:27.143 --> 57:28.907
- No.
- No?

57:29.112 --> 57:31.104
Well, he, it was kind of...

57:31.314 --> 57:33.943
- As far as I know, I didn't even know...
- It wasn't good.

57:34.150 --> 57:35.550
...that was Roger's wife.

57:35.752 --> 57:38.051
Yeah, Roger was married
when he was very young.

57:38.254 --> 57:40.553
- And...
- And he was 19...

57:40.757 --> 57:45.127
...and Kit said to him, "It's not a
good idea for you to have a wife."

57:45.328 --> 57:48.321
And so he didn't get rid of his wife
because of that...

57:48.565 --> 57:50.693
...but he actually kept her
out of the picture.

57:50.934 --> 57:53.096
- Right.
- She was not in the picture.

57:53.303 --> 57:57.001
I mean, I remember that Kit
was very, um...

57:57.207 --> 58:00.336
Always concerned, though, that...

58:00.810 --> 58:01.937
...she got money.

58:02.145 --> 58:04.876
The idea I've got
is called "Glittering Girl." It's...

58:05.114 --> 58:07.845
- That's a very good title.
- It's, slightly different to that.

58:08.084 --> 58:10.383
It's more beaty,
more punchy sort of thing.

58:10.620 --> 58:14.614
I'll give you a few bars.

58:16.526 --> 58:17.789
I want it to sort of be very:

58:21.164 --> 58:23.998
- Like that. No, it's got drums...
- Some guitar in...

58:24.200 --> 58:26.726
- ...and where the whole group will be...
- Yeah.

58:33.610 --> 58:35.841

That could take it to the next bit.

59:23.560 --> 59:26.655
- Yeah.
- And there's a very quiet bit after that.

59:28.264 --> 59:30.426
Be good for Keith, yeah.

59:47.216 --> 59:48.582
- That sort of...
- That's...

59:48.785 --> 59:51.482
I think, really, that's much
more direct, which...

59:51.721 --> 59:53.485
And when I miss Kit,
is in the studio.

59:53.723 --> 59:57.125
Although, you know, he spent a lot of time
mentoring me as a writer.

59:57.327 --> 59:59.455
<i>There was this sense
that everything about the band...</i>

59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.688
- ...was being honored in the studio.
- Yeah.

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:03.799
<i>You know, if I'd written three songs...</i>

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.128
<i>...and presented them to him,
"They were all good."</i>

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.465
<i>That's how his response was.</i>

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.799
<i>He had found something good
about all of them.</i>

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.202
<i>And he wouldn't,
he wouldn't kind of say:</i>

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:14.900
<i>"And that, they're all good,
but that one's great."</i>

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.478
<i>It'd be, "They're all good.
Let's work on that one."</i>

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:20.445
<i>And what I started to realize
over a period of many years...</i>

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:24.485
<i>...was the one that he'd pick to work on
would be the one that he really thought...</i>

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:27.589
<i>...either was promising or great,
and the others, perhaps...</i>

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.725
...would just slide into the background.

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:33.363
When I go back through my catalog
of the material...

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:35.588
...that I used to play to Kit...

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:38.029
...there must be 80 percent
of what I wrote...

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:40.031
- ...just went on a back burner.
- Right.

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:43.433
It didn't even get to be heard
by the band until years later.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.735
So I think it's that capacity
that he had...

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.935
...to accentuate the positive.

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:52.047
<i>He had a natural ear for commercial.</i>

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.477
Something that you could
sell out there.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.176
But the commercial
wasn't just a record.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.379
It was a whole package...

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:04.253
...and that whole package also included
attitude and philosophy, stagecraft...

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.122
<i>...and art school kind of ideas.</i>

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.821
And I think if you grab an idea
and you run with it...

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:11.001
...the chances are
somebody's gonna sneer at you.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.295
You know, and if it's successful, um...

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:18.041
...and they didn't think of it first,
they're gonna be particularly pissed off.

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:20.009
Well, originally...

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:24.408
..."My Generation" was going to be
like a 16 bar Jimmy Reed song.

...and a true dynamic to society...

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:05.521
<i>...as a kid blocked up on pills
with a stutter.</i>

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:07.084
<i>It was so true.</i>

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:10.054
<i>It wasn't a gimmick at all,
because kids stuttered.</i>

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.952
<i>Especially when they were on pills...</i>

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:16.633
<i>...on French blues
and black bombers and Drinamyl.</i>

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:21.270
<i>And, it worked, and of course,
it made everybody sit up and take notice.</i>

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.368
I've heard a lot about you and the
rest of the group taking drugs, Pete.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:29.205
Does this mean you're usually blocked up
when you're actually on stage?

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:33.110
No, but it means we're blocked
up all the time, you know.

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.477
The intensity was always
to keep The Who...

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:39.348
...like a new form of crime in as much
as they were never meant to be...

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:41.353
...like, a "professional showbiz group."

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:45.221
<i>They weren't handsome,
you know, they weren't nice.</i>

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:48.762
<i>You know, they were outsiders, man.
They were sort of like, misfits.</i>

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:52.868
<i>You know, they were looking to sort of,
like, claim their place.</i>

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:55.300
Remember those shows
that we used to do in cinemas...

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:57.940
...and that guy,
who was a big fan of the band...

01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.666
...who banned us
from the Granada Circuit...

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:02.174
...because he disapproved
of us smashing our instruments?

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:05.609
- Do you remember that?
- I remember it vaguely.

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:07.579
"And the pity because
you're such a good band."

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:10.083
<i>And it was always me he would
take out and give these lectures.</i>

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:13.313
And I was just reduced to kind of
telling him to fuck off.

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:16.516
Kit was trying to explain,
"You have to have this band on." Yeah.

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:18.921
- This is a different kind of music.
- It's a different kind of thing.

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:23.589
<i>You know, there was something
about not honoring electric guitars.</i>

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.666
<i>A, they were electric.</i>

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:29.532
<i>You know, we were looking at sound
as sound, not just music.</i>

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:33.675
<i>The electrification, if you like,
the modernization of life, right?</i>

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:37.108
<i>And us as a generation had seen that
first in destruction, you know...</i>

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:39.475
<i>...in a war, in a... On a beautiful city...</i>

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:42.948
<i>...that we're living in had been bombed.
It was abstract.</i>

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.178
<i>And it was a huge statement
for The Who audience...</i>

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:48.118
<i>...because The Who audience
were coming to grips.</i>

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:51.988
<i>The Who audience was trying to, sort of,
like, get some life in their body...</i>

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:53.959
<i>...and life in their head
and life in their hearts.</i>

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:56.792
<i>And life wasn't really offering
them that, you know.</i>

01:03:56.999 --> 01:04:00.492
<i>It was offering them a sort of an abstract,
isolated form of life.</i>

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:02.569
<i>You know, they were saying,
here's TV...</i>

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.296
<i>...but they were also
being sort of told...</i>

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.976
<i>...but, you know, you're still
a working class kid.</i>

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.637
<i>You're still white trash.</i>

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.009
<i>The group were acting out,
because, you know...</i>

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:16.084
<i>...we were like a fucked up
family system right here, you know.</i>

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:18.754
<i>So there's a lot of like,
weird behaviors going on...</i>

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:24.518
...and one of them was Roger,
whacked Keith Moon...

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:27.390
...and then they had a fight on stage.
Thank God, right?

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:29.998
Thank God it wasn't wasted
in the dressing room.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.594
So they had a fight on stage...

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:36.772
...and, um, Keith said, um...

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:39.407
...that he'd never fucking work
with Roger again.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:43.874
<i>So Kit and I sort of said, "Okay,
so the band won't be the same band."</i>

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.709
<i>You know, so we presented
an idea to them.</i>

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:49.249
We'd create a band around Roger...

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:51.852
...and then the three of them would...
That sort of stuff.

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:54.489
But we were just winging it.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:57.182
We really wanted them
to be the four guys.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.554
<i>I remember I got
a phone call from Chris...</i>

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:03.699
...and he said that he's spoken to Roger
and that he got him to promise...

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.496
...not to resort to violence
to win arguments again.

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:12.107
And I said something like, "Good luck.
I hope you can pull it off."

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:13.867
And, you know, in fact he did.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:16.443
That was really our only way
of dealing with...

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:17.909
We all had our own methods.

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:19.275
- I would...
- That's right.

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:20.949
You weren't as good as Keith.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.709
He was...

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:27.283
He was incredibly cruel when...
My God, I paid for that day.

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:31.016
<i>I had three years of hell,
and he would deliberately goad me.</i>

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:33.719
He would do anything
just to try and make me explode.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.626
It was a hell.

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:39.825
It was a painful time, and you and I didn't
talk about it really at all at the time.

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:43.233
I was living in the office. Went
from the back of the van to the office.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:46.102
But he went through
a kind of strange misery of his own.

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.278
<i>- Do you remember that thing where he...
- I knew he was miserable.</i>

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:51.914
<i>That period where
he was on stage and he was crying...</i>

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:54.413
<i>- Yeah.
- ...in deep depression.</i>

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:57.485
<i>You could just tell that
there was something that he wanted...</i>

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.246
...that he wasn't ever gonna get.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:03.256
- Yeah.
- And in a way, he wanted us to deliver it.

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:04.927
- Yeah.
- We couldn't deliver it.

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.755
And he couldn't articulate it.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.933
I remember you were always
more sympathetic to him than I was...

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.964
...when he was in that state.
"Fuck off," you know?

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:13.261
I remember you going up
and putting your arm around him...

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:14.937
...and saying,
"What can... What is it, mate?

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:16.161
- What can we do?"
- Yeah.

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.670
And I remember saying
to you, "Tell him to fuck...

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:20.138
You know, stop taking his stupid
whatever it is he's taking."

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.141
And you said, "No, there's something
wrong with him.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.109
There's something deeply wrong here."

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:27.340
And he was just... He had a...
What looked like a nervous breakdown.

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:30.883
He was obviously on some drug or other.
But it had led to a condition...

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.783
...that was definitely
a manic depression.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.289
- It lasted for about two weeks.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.017
- And...
- Like he became schizophrenic.

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:40.822
- Wasn't it? Very strange.
- Yeah.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:44.023
I think we all knew what we had.
I remember thinking certainly...

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:46.168
...if this band breaks apart now...

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:49.100
...what I've got left
is never gonna equal it.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:53.834
We somehow eased that through,
diplomatically, ahem...

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.534
...and Roger...

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:58.374
...wonderfully agreed
to stop hitting people.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:01.049
And he's stood up to that
until today.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:04.220
And they... And it worked.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:09.916
So their end of the family
was broken up for a period...

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:13.186
...and we managed to sort of
get over the breakup...

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:15.058
...you know, and come back together.

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:18.428
And then there were lots
of bits and pieces like that.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.499
- I was thrown out.
- No, I was thrown out.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.695
- No, I was thrown out too.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:26.271
Now what actually happened was that
I discovered that Keith and John...

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:29.741
...were forming this group
with Jimmy Page called Led Zeppelin.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.842
That's what they were up to.
God knows I'd had no idea...

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.349
<i>...that they were gonna form
a heavy metal band...</i>

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.885
<i>...which is what they were talking
about doing, John and Keith.</i>

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.024
I'd gone through that thing in Paris...

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:47.891
...of hearing, um, Keith and John
talking about me behind my back...

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.293
<i>...in a way that was
very, very disparaging.</i>

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:52.695
Dear, dear Pete.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:59.975
I was about to go into a hotel room
and be with them, and I just turned back...

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:03.077
...and I went to my room
and just sat there and thought.

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:05.748
I felt like a real outsider.

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:18.393
<i>Kit and I were in a club. We saw
Jimi. He's just played with the group.</i>

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:19.993
<i>It wasn't his show.</i>

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.595
<i>He just jammed with the group,
and we saw that...</i>

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:24.095
<i>...and we heard him as well.</i>

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.792
<i>And we saw him,
and we thought he's amazing.</i>

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:36.509
<i>And we went up afterwards,
and Chas Chandler was there...</i>

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:39.738
<i>...and we realized that Chas
was the guy taking care of him.</i>

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.975
<i>So Jimi's sort of standing there,
and we're talking to Chas...</i>

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.747
<i>...and we said to Chas, "Listen, does he...</i>

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:50.290
<i>Can we... Can we produce him?" Right?
And Chas said, "Well, I'm doing that."</i>

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:52.587
<i>We said, "Okay."
We said, "Can we manage him?"</i>

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.765
<i>And he said, "Well, The Animals,
you know, Mike, is doing that."</i>

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.264
<i>And we said,
"Has he got a record label?"</i>

01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:00.595
And he said, "No."
We said, "We'll do that then." Heh.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.170
And we had talked about
having a record label...

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:06.666
...but we'd never actually...
We hadn't actually put it into place.

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:09.435
So we immediately put it into place
to get Jimi.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.671
So you offered
Jimi Hendrix a record deal...

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.372
...but you didn't actually have
a record company?

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:15.608
Right, that's right, that's right.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.553
We didn't have a record company,
but we intended to have one.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.050
And so he was the beginning.

01:09:20.288 --> 01:09:22.383
Kit was the first guy...

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:25.026
...to start an independent record label...

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.821
...you know, in the world.

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:30.363
And he went to Polydor
and he got a deal.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.626
I had got that artwork done of the f...

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.770
You know, have you ever seen
the Track Record artwork?

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.529
You know, it's like a...
It's a stylus on a record.

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:40.004
<i>The arm of the stylus
coming out onto a record...</i>

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.804
<i>...only it's a T, but that was the design.</i>

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:46.881
<i>- I mean, and it was done overnight.
- Track was the other home.</i>

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:49.313
<i>- It's where everyone went.
- It was great. It was a great vibe.</i>

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:51.180
<i>And you didn't say
I'm going down the office.</i>

01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:52.912
- No, no, no.
- Going down to Track.

01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:55.488
And it wasn't very much
of an office, was it?

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:56.715
- It was great.
- It was great.

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:57.985
- It was wonderful.
- But, I mean, it wasn't...

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.492
There wasn't a lot of, sort of,
like, business going on there.

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.027
- Do you remember?
- It felt like it.

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:04.893
<i>But it was ideas driven, right?
It was ideas driven.</i>

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:11.901
But you've got sufficient
financial backing.

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:15.236
Hold on, sir. Kit? Problem.

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:19.949
- Phillip's had his guitar stolen.
- Christ. Um...

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:23.682
- Can you try and borrow one from Pete?
- I'll get on to Pete straight away.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:27.516
<i>We wanted to do all of this
message stuff, but we embraced all of it.</i>

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.885
We were not afraid
of commercialism at all.

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.890
I am the god of hellfire!

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:33.687
And I bring you...

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.524
♪ Fire ♪

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.091
<i>♪ I'll take you to burn ♪♪</i>

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:45.641
<i>Track was the first time you
and Kit did anything outside of The Who...</i>

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.969
...and then all of the sudden,
Kit was producing other artists.

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:51.476
<i>And it did feel strange
to me at the time.</i>

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:56.550
<i>Kit, to his credit, used to include me.
I mean, when Arthur Brown was doing...</i>

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.214
<i>...when he was mixing
"Fire," he'd say, "Come down.</i>

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.049
<i>I want you to help me mix it."</i>

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.782
But it's just how it felt.
It was very strange.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:05.894
Is it going to be an R and B
label or an experimental label?

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:08.356
We're gonna have a lot
of experimental stuff on it.

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.965
In fact, Pete Townshend is...

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.226
...heading up
a mysterious department...

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:16.099
...called Jazz and New Sounds.
<i>- For me, the Track years...</i>

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.605
...were exciting because
I had Thunderclap Newman.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:20.571
- Right.
- While I was doing demos for <i>Tommy...</i>

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:24.144
...I'm knocking the demos for <i>Tommy</i> out,
you know, I'm working on...

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.475
...this little band, you know...

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:30.983
...and kind of cooking stuff up
out of nothing, having this brain fart.

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:34.315
Thinking, "That guitar player,
that guy, put them together." Da-da-da-da.

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:36.253
- Yeah.
- Next thing, it was number one.

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:39.018
So there's this sense that,
"This is easy." You know?

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:41.753
It was only hard because
before it was with The Who.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.126
You know, they're very hard.
They're difficult.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.700
But when you work
with somebody else, it's easy.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:48.665
<i>Arthur Brown, number one.</i>

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:50.532
<i>You know, "Something In The Air,"
number one.</i>

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:52.435
<i>You know, Jimi Hendrix, number one.</i>

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:56.043
Marc Bolan and John's Children
with "Ride A White Swan," number one.

01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:59.043
We couldn't get fucking number ones.
Everybody else was getting number one.

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:02.410
<i>Track had four number ones
in a row with other artists.</i>

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:03.950
<i>Marsha Hunt went to number four.</i>

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:09.321
<i>I mean, you know,
ours were down at ten, 14. Ha, ha.</i>

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:11.687
No. Hold on, sir. Kit?

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:15.329
The feeling I had was that
we were never gonna make it in America.

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:17.056
- Yeah.
- Never in a million years.

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:19.200
I just remember kind of
looking at the kind of bands...

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.994
...that were making it
in America, thinking, you know...

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:24.435
...if they like Eric Burdon, we're fucked.

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:27.199
Where especially in the States
would you like to visit?

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:30.436
- California, I think.
- Why California?

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:33.047
There's a good recording
studio over there, Western.

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:34.740
And the surfing and hot rods.

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:37.817
Yeah. Surfing and the hot rods
and the girls over there.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:41.457
Why do you want to record in
America? Why does this appeal to you?

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:43.888
It's because it's different
from recording here.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.584
- Sunnier.
- Better studios.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:48.457
No, I'm just... I'm not worried
about the studios or the sound.

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:50.690
But when you go outside,
you can get a tan...

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.561
<i>...which is more than you can get here.</i>

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:59.031
<i>We really saw
the huge complexity of what America is.</i>

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:00.766
<i>Can you imagine Jackson, Mississippi...</i>

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:04.070
<i>...Chicago, Detroit, you know,
and then Baton Rouge.</i>

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:09.411
<i>And we went everywhere on this tour
in this horrible old prop plane.</i>

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:11.744
<i>And it had bunks in it.</i>

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.683
<i>These sort of, like, rope bunks.</i>

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:18.622
<i>It was really shitty, but it was...
We were all on it, all these three groups.</i>

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:22.696
And there was a sort of
old sort of American tour manager.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:26.062
And especially in the South,
when the plane had st...

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:28.567
You know, landed and we were
about to get out...

01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:32.264
...he would stand at the door before we
get out and he would tell us all...

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:34.443
...he'd say, "Listen, in this state...

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:38.876
...fucking women who are under,
you know, over, under 20 or..."

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:41.516
- Because it was different in every state.
- Every time he said:

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.209
"Because you could go to prison for this.
You could do this," you know.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.755
So the local rules
of where we were going...

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:51.119
...were always told to us
before we got off the plane.

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:52.726
And they were mostly about fucking.

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.054
<i>♪ Magic bus ♪♪</i>

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:57.222
<i>And then they started
releasing really mediocre songs...</i>

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:02.599
<i>...like "Magic Bus", "Dogs",
"Call Me Lightning", things like this...</i>

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:05.741
<i>...that were sort of not really
up to The Who's standard.</i>

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.775
<i>And he said, "Well, we've run out
of songs basically."</i>

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:11.913
<i>And it looked very much
like it was the end of the band.</i>

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:19.619
<i>Before</i> Tommy <i>we were
finished. Without something audacious...</i>

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:22.621
<i>...The Who were done for.
So, you know...</i>

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:26.489
<i>...somewhere there,
Kit and I took a gamble.</i>

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:29.187
I spoke earlier about the fact that...

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:33.163
...Kit had nurtured me as a composer.

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:35.462
I don't mean a songwriter.

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:38.607
I mean a composer.
I wanted to learn to orchestrate...

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:42.107
<i>...and I wanted to write an opera.
Kit came in sideways...</i>

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:48.808
...and he was the one that,
in a sense, accused me of vanity.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.284
He said, "You know,
The Who need a new single."

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.514
You know, and I said, "Well, you know,
I'm working on this opera."

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:57.215
He said, "Well, you know,
how's it gonna help The Who?"

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.325
And I said, "Don't know."

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:02.693
<i>He said, "Well, what have you got?" I said,
"I've got this, this, this, and this."</i>

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:07.029
<i>We were just totally immersed
in this venture.</i>

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:11.601
You know, the... Any growth,
any personal self-growth...

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:16.302
...was happening within this space.

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:19.037
It didn't really happen outside of it.

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.242
It started to end about 19...

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:26.854
You know, that closeness
began to end, really, after <i>Tommy.</i>

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:29.820
That's the... That's the
second era, so to speak.

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:32.759
<i>Tommy</i> was the major turning
point for that band.

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:34.623
You know,
there was up to <i>Tommy...</i>

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:35.889
...and after <i>Tommy.</i>

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.996
And <i>Tommy</i> was the turning point.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.034
Pete said to me, he said,
at the time of <i>Tommy...</i>

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.831
...it was the first time
the word "million" ever appeared.

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:51.240
<i>By the end of five years,
we had produced</i> Tommy.

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.745
<i>We'd done all
the opera house tours.</i>

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.884
<i>You know, we created
a new way of touring.</i>

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:58.349
<i>And it was just
a very short period of time.</i>

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:02.355
<i>And 1969, with</i> Tommy <i>was

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.049

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:07.525

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:11.957

we're talking about 1969.</i>

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:29.124
I used to go to events
at the Russian Embassy...

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:33.426
...and watch four-hour totally boring films
on Lenin and all that, you know.

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:37.868
As I was a bit of an expert on Lenin,
I could hold my own. But it was awful.

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:40.565
<i>We wanted to get
Moscow Opera House...</i>

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.177
<i>...and we wanted to get
the Metropolitan Opera House.</i>

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:46.176
<i>And we wanted to sort of
have the headline:</i>

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:50.010
"Rock Breaks the Iron Curtain,"
you know, when we flew from Moscow.

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.414
<i>They wouldn't give us
their fucking opera house.</i>

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:55.989
They offered us St. Petersburg,
but it was years down the road, you know.

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:58.922
And in rock 'n' roll terms,
that was like a century, right?

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.322
And who are The Who?

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:03.328
Well, The Who are The Who,
that's who they are.

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:05.967
A rock group,
veterans of Woodstock...

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:08.967
...and now the authors
and performers in a rock-opera.

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:12.198
- You could feel the vibrations.
- Man, we freaked it all out.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.033
- It's beautiful.
- It's unreal.

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:17.212
Without the libretto, it was more difficult
than Italian opera.

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:19.706
The seats are comfortable,
aren't they?

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:21.974
<i>Keith Moon loved the melodrama...</i>

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:25.052
<i>...and the pomposity of,
"Shut up, it's a fucking opera!"</i>

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:26.448
<i>You know?</i>

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:29.916
<i>John Entwistle got to play
the French horn...</i>

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.856
...and I could see
that it maybe might give Kit...

01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:34.927
...his big movie
that he'd always wanted.

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:36.621
<i>The relationship that I had with Kit...</i>

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:38.790
<i>...was about the fact that he...</i>

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.663
...right from the very, very beginning...

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:44.702
...was quite clearly
a frustrated composer.

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:46.668
<i>So he saw in me...</i>

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:51.836
...a chance to expound
some of his own frustrated ideas.

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.811
<i>He encouraged the preposterous.</i>

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:55.950
<i>The more preposterous, the better.</i>

01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:58.086
The more adventurous,
the more dangerous...

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.221
...the more exotic, the more absurd.

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:02.754
<i>Tommy</i> was a mess.
It was typical Townshend thing.

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:05.825
He'd have a song here, something there,
a bit of music there, something here...

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.189
...some abandoned project there,
a laundry list there.

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:11.093
And he put it all together
and try and get some sort of...

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:12.596
...great concept out of it.

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:16.032
But Kit, because of his, I suppose...

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:18.764
...scriptwriting experience
on films and stuff...

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.270
...put it into some order...

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:23.342
...because he was writing the script
as <i>Tommy</i> was recorded.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:27.710
Pete may have always known
the story inside, right?

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:30.351
We know it was about
this deaf, dumb and blind boy...

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.576
...it's about vibes.

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:34.051
I mean, the original idea
is deaf, dumb and blind boy.

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:39.593
Um, he... Vibes, this was,
like, '68, right? Acid was big.

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:42.025
It was all about vibes,
all about connection.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:45.291
The infinity of the universe...

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:49.265
...of eternity, of all the eternal
aspects of the universe...

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:51.871
...aware of the invalidity...

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.238
...of what we know as reality.

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:58.437
Reality with a small R.

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:00.946
<i>Kit found it very, very difficult...</i>

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:05.416
...when I started to study
spiritual matters.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:10.524
And, particularly,
the work of Inayat Khan...

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:13.889
...the Sufi Master
who was a master musician.

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:18.328
Kit, you know, was just...
He just wanted it to stop.

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:22.137
Yeah, but that's like
fucking hippie-dippy, right?

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:24.806
Which it was.
Come on, I mean, like, vibes, you know?

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.738
Deaf, dumb and blind, that bit's good.
But how did he get deaf, dumb and blind?

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.914
<i>Tommy</i> began
as a spiritual allegory...

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.241
...and he made it
a story of postwar life.

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:37.283
So we had the lover come home
with the husband from the war...

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:40.785
...kill the lover, the kid sees it,
the lover and mother shake the kid.

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:43.151
"You didn't hear it."
And traumatize him, right?

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.793
So he goes into trauma,
becomes deaf, dumb and blind.

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.189
Then he tries some acid...

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.261
...the Acid Queen, to bring him back...

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.955
...and he's growing up,
and never gets back.

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.431
Then he has a breakup,
and he gets enlightened...

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:57.072
...he has a sort of spiritual experience
and becomes an enlightened being.

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:59.639
When Pete was writing the songs...

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:02.834
...and it was his original idea...

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:05.479
...um, within the studio context...

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.309
...it wasn't clear
where it was going...

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:09.711
...where it was gonna end.

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:13.581
I mean, the songs, the bad stuff,
the shitty stuff...

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:16.815
...you know, Uncle Ernie,
who's a fucking pedophile, right?

01:23:17.025 --> 01:23:19.153
And Cousin Kevin who's a bully, right?

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.694
You know, the real stuff
that happens in life.

01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:23.956
You know, John Entwistle
wrote those songs.

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:29.797
He was more of a sort of, you know,
nasty, cynical, grounded type of being.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.837
<i>Do you know what I mean?
That he could write that horrible shit...</i>

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.906
<i>...because John was a very dark guy.</i>

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.610
What was it that you
went to see this doctor for?

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:37.836
- I had a poisoned finger.
- A poisoned finger.

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.411
- How did you get it?
- It was weeping.

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.343
<i>When we asked him,
there was a big grin on his face.</i>

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.609
<i>"I'll write them, sure."</i>

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:48.017
Kit wrote a screenplay...

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:51.125
...only as a guideline...

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:53.022
...for the guys in the studio.

01:23:53.628 --> 01:23:55.256
Remember,
we didn't have any money...

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.329
...we were in a sort of cheap studio...

01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:00.229
...and come Thursday we would pack up,
put it in the van...

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:02.700
...because the group
had to go out and perform...

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:04.770
...to get the money.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.271
They couldn't take time off
to actually record.

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:11.511
And Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights
were the big earners, right?

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:14.239
Then they would come back in.
So it was always lost all over the place.

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:16.782
Sometimes they would go out
and play some songs they recorded...

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:19.214
...then come back,
they want to re-record them.

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:23.415
So Kit wrote this screenplay
as a way to give it structure.

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:25.092
And he showed it to Pete.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.589
And he'd noted where there should be
some songs and stuff like that.

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:32.359
Now, whether that fell in line
with Pete's overall vision, I don't know.

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:35.594
And, certainly,
let me put it this way:

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:40.105
Pete doesn't really give credit
for the screenplay to Kit.

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:44.706
So, it's an un... It's a mystery.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.075
He started to bring in the idea...

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:49.444
...that there was
a postwar element in there.

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:53.086
But, you know, I already had songs
like "Captain Walker Didn't Come Home."

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:55.086
I already had songs about, you know...

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:59.489
...child abuse and brutality
and bullying and, you know...

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:02.697
So, you know, it was all there,
you know, it's my story.

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:07.597
And he came up with a few things
that were really fundamentally important:

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:10.567
The idea of doing an overture,
which I did at the end...

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:14.300
...and also the idea
of repeating the refrain at the end...

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:16.445
...the "Listening To You"
prayer at the end...

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:19.512
...putting that at the end.
I think that's some ideas he had...

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:21.648
...but we were all
rather kind of groping.

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:26.754
The film was gonna be produced
and directed by Lambert/Stamp.

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.651
I mean, no one else, right?

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:31.850
So we're gonna make this film,
and we're gonna make it our way.

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:33.994
We're gonna cast it our way...

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:38.098
...and we're gonna sort of, like, do it,
and it's gonna be another level.

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:44.102
And suddenly, Pete Townshend
balks at this idea.

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:48.538
The first sort of "pfft" in the camp.

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:49.971
Right? The first breakup.

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:52.977
<i>You know, just on an emotional
level, you know...</i>

01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:57.516
<i>...Kit and I weren't even gonna attempt
to make the movie without Pete.</i>

01:25:57.752 --> 01:26:00.950
<i>What had happened
was that they'd come at me with a script...</i>

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:03.887
<i>...with a treatment,
and I wouldn't look at it.</i>

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:07.027
<i>I'm not... You know,
I'm not gonna allow a film to be made.</i>

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:10.699
<i>I'm not gonna allow you to make a film.
Because I didn't want to lose them.</i>

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:12.495
<i>I felt already that they were going...</i>

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.693
<i>...I thought they were going to
Hollywood, so I wouldn't look at it.</i>

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:18.840
<i>And what was bad about it
was the way I'd handled it.</i>

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:22.208
And what I see now
is Pete was afraid, now...

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:24.902
...that if Lambert and Stamp
do the film...

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:26.580
...then Lambert and Stamp...

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:29.978
...being the producer-managers
of The Who is sort of over.

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:32.848
We have also...
We've completed our cycle...

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:36.388
...we've come back to make...
And we make our film, and we leave.

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:40.695
We become the bad parents
who are abandoning them, right?

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:45.156
What happened was,
is that Kit appropriated it...

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:48.097
...the piece, as an opportunity
to make a movie.

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:53.297
He took the story,
he wrote a script around it...

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:57.309
...which was loosely based on
the story that I'd written.

01:26:57.745 --> 01:26:59.043
Um...

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:01.716
And...

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:06.445
Registered it as a grand right.

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:10.455
And took it to Universal...

01:27:10.692 --> 01:27:13.719
...and tried to persuade them
to make a movie and...

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:16.693
Meanwhile, I was on to the next thing,
you know, so...

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:20.331
And, <i>Tommy,</i>
he never got to make <i>Tommy...</i>

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:25.200
...but felt that he should do,
you know, and...

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:27.068
Um...

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:29.944
And we never really worked together
again after that.

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:39.115
<i>In Kit's myth, he'd been
conceived in Venice, if you like.</i>

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:42.624
<i>His father and mother
were on their honeymoon...</i>

01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:45.850
<i>...or Constant was playing
some sort of orchestra or something.</i>

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.427
And Kit had this thing about Venice...

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.861
...that it was his...
There was some other draw.

01:27:51.065 --> 01:27:58.063
<i>In 1971, um, Kit rented a floor
of a palazzo on the Grand Canal...</i>

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.266
<i>...and it was quite, quite magical.</i>

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:03.735
He obviously
developed a taste for Venice...

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:07.109
...because very soon
he bought his own palazzo...

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:08.613
...the Palazzo Dario.

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:12.878
<i>Kit bought it from
some Italian nobleman.</i>

01:28:13.087 --> 01:28:15.921
Or rather the estate
of some Italian nobleman...

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:19.151
...who had been murdered
by his Yugoslav boyfriend...

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:22.125
...I think,
about six or seven months before.

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:26.995
And Jane and I found ourselves
sleeping in the murder bedroom.

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:31.906
And one morning, I was scrambling about
under the bed for my slippers...

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:35.474
...and I felt something sort of
slightly soft and plastic.

01:28:35.677 --> 01:28:41.947
And I touched it, and I realized
that it was a gout of blood.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:45.416
<i>By that time, Kit was becoming
quite well known.</i>

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.988
<i>He was known as "Il Barone,"
"Il Barone Lambert."</i>

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:52.558
And so I think when he started
to make good money...

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:54.422
...I think he rather anticipated...

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:58.157
...the receiving of money
by spending it early...

01:28:58.366 --> 01:29:00.665
<i>...but eventually
he did make a lot of money.</i>

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:03.531
And so everyone had money,
for the first time.

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:07.140
Now, that was sort of needed,
nice for everyone to have some security.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.641
<i>And so when the</i> Tommy <i>thing
didn't continue...</i>

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:12.370
...straight on into a film,
there was this sort of gap.

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.345
You know, the actual life
that came about was normal life...

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:17.348
...and we all wanted some normal life.

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:19.453
<i>People had started
to buy houses...</i>

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:21.350
<i>...and John had gotten married.</i>

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:24.048
<i>He'd married his schoolgirl
sweetheart, and, um...</i>

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:26.818
<i>They've also started
to make babies...</i>

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.724
...you know, have girlfriends.

01:29:28.963 --> 01:29:34.197
Kit found me having
a conventional little family...

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:37.566
...that was gonna lead to me having
children and a house and stuff...

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.365
...he found it very bourgeois.

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:42.076
<i>And was quite antagonistic.</i>

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:46.537
They're not quite
as, dangerously out of control...

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:48.080
...right, as Kit and I.

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:50.478
I mean, you know,
we were gonna go to the edge.

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:05.225
<i>Kit went to New York
and started to produce records there...</i>

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:06.628
<i>...and had some success.</i>

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:11.704
<i>The life of New York then was...
You know, matched Kit's own decadence.</i>

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:14.068
<i>There was a lot of coke,
a lot of drugs...</i>

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:15.937
<i>...a lot of, like, action, whatever.</i>

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:20.878
<i>I cried when Kit called me
and invited me to New York to work...</i>

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:24.541
<i>...because I'd kind of really lost heart
in the</i> Lifehouse <i>project.</i>

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:27.385
<i>Battering away, battering away,
battering away...</i>

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:32.117
<i>...trying to get people to get inside what
it was that I was trying to get across.</i>

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.051
<i>I knew I had this great music...</i>

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:37.664
<i>...but just not the craft and skills
to deliver a story that made sense...</i>

01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:40.164
<i>...and not any idea
about how it would work...</i>

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:42.836
...that was a hopeful return
to a project...

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:45.471
...if not a frontline production process...

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:49.474
...certainly one in which he would have
some kind of mentoring figure in it...

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:51.942
- That's right, that's right.
- ...as he had on <i>Tommy.</i>

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:55.679
The next rift type of thing
came about with...

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:58.409
...what became
the <i>Who's Next</i> album.

01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:02.078
The <i>Who's Next</i> album
was a conceptual project...

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.782
...a rock opera called <i>Lifehouse.</i>

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:09.453
<i>And Kit didn't actually think
the piece was right...</i>

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:13.624
...because he thought the idea,
which was a mystical idea...

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.497
...was too mystical.

01:31:15.703 --> 01:31:20.334
And also, I think, unconsciously Kit was,
like, wounded in a sense of saying:

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:22.806
"Why should I work with Pete
on <i>Lifehouse?</i>

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:25.343
So you can fuck me
when I wanna make a film of it?"

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.573
I don't know. That's purely come
to my head for the first time.

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:31.981
Kit did help. Um...

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:37.820
He brought us to New York, where he
was based, working with Patti LaBelle.

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:41.518
And he thought we should invite all
the great New York musicians to help.

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:45.393
Just... Not actually to do finished
recordings. That wasn't Kit's idea.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:48.193
The idea of Kit's was to, sort of,
shift the focus.

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:54.638
Um, Pete had had issues with Kit
on production, um...

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:58.969
...of <i>Who's Next,</i> which was kind of
all a bit of a mystery...

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.877
...to the rest of the band,
because something happened...

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:04.244
...between Pete and Kit,
and we don't know what.

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:06.886
We went to... We did
some recording of <i>Who's Next...</i>

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:09.920
...in New York,
which sounded great to me.

01:32:10.157 --> 01:32:11.648
Um...

01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:15.724
Came back to England,
and the next thing we know...

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.364
...we're gonna re-record it.

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:20.831
<i>And these decisions were all
made by Pete, who, you know...</i>

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:23.231
<i>...now was gaining
more and more control.</i>

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:31.206
<i>Kit was making
a new life in New York.</i>

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:36.077
<i>There was a sort of a sense
of safety for Kit in that world.</i>

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:41.222
<i>We didn't see what Kit was building
for himself there, and how carefully...</i>

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:44.688
<i>...he was structuring it, and how it was
very much from his old world.</i>

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:47.361
<i>It became clear that Kit
was in bad shape...</i>

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:50.964
...but the most important thing
was that Keith was...

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:53.724
It wasn't right for Keith to be
working in New York.

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:56.666
<i>He was using narcotics,
and we were very worried about him.</i>

01:32:56.871 --> 01:33:00.467
So we had him and Kit
at the same time...

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:03.906
...and it was almost like, you know,
who do we keep an eye on?

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:05.807
<i>At the end, on</i> Quadrophenia...

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:08.414
<i>...when we got to the studio,
Kit did that thing...</i>

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:11.176
...of showing up about
two or three hours late.

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:16.756
Did really lose my temper with him
one night, because he was so disruptive.

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:18.620
What happened?

01:33:18.826 --> 01:33:22.922
I just... You know,
just kind of went for him and...

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.827
I didn't do anything, I didn't hit him.
I really wanted to.

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:28.059
I wanted to throw him down the stairs.

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:31.569
And he started to cry, and he was...

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:34.298
He was obviously in very bad shape.

01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:36.409
You know, he suddenly broke down.

01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:39.206
I was saying to him,
"You let me down, you let me down."

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:43.509
"This is a very hard project.
I can't do it on my own. It's too hard.

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:45.913
There's so much to do."
I'd just come out of...

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.114
I was in the middle of, actually...
Dealing with two other quite big things.

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:54.022
One was... I'd got involved with,
Eric Clapton...

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:57.959
...and his, you know, recovery
from the grave of the day.

01:33:58.165 --> 01:34:01.624
But also we were preparing
the <i>Tommy</i> film.

01:34:01.836 --> 01:34:06.171
So I was really quite hard-pressed
and really wanted...

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:08.104
Just needed a bit of help with...

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:12.007
Because it was kind of done,
but it needed a bit of...

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:14.374
It needed Kit, really.

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:16.311
And, um...

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:20.978
Anyway, it would have been a different
ball of string if he'd have been around.

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:24.056
But that was the last attempt
that he had of...

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:27.160
At being, you know, part of things.

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:30.256
<i>I went to collect Kit
from a nursing home.</i>

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:34.492
<i>I think he was drying out from alcohol. I
went to collect him from a nursing home...</i>

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:37.797
<i>...I think in Redding,
to drive him to stay with us.</i>

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:41.407
And he insisted on saying:

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:43.634
"I want to stop somewhere
on the way."

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.904
And he stopped off
at a wine merchant's.

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:48.707
And although he was not meant
to be drinking himself...

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:52.182
...he brought us three bottles
of some of the most wonderful claret...

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:54.480
...I've ever drunk in my life.

01:34:55.489 --> 01:35:00.518
<i>Kit's idea of Venice... He bought
the palazzo. He would start to write there.</i>

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:04.824
<i>This was a bit of a idealistic dream,
but he... That was his idea.</i>

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:09.697
<i>Track was gonna transship
vinyl to Russia and to India...</i>

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:12.203
<i>...you know,
which you couldn't do business.</i>

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:14.341
<i>Records weren't allowed to be sold.</i>

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:18.536
<i>So we would transship them
for goods through Venice, right?</i>

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:21.511
<i>Which was just
a very solid business idea.</i>

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.617
<i>It was before the Wall came down...</i>

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:28.585
<i>...and there was this whole market
of rock 'n' roll that wanted it madly.</i>

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:31.554
<i>And we would give it to them
and take all the money.</i>

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:33.887
<i>But we would then leave it in Venice.</i>

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:37.463
<i>And Kit's idea was to create all
the money for Venice In Peril.</i>

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:39.963
<i>That's what Kit wanted.
To save Venice, because...</i>

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:43.638
<i>...he considered it an incredible
artistic creative center.</i>

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:48.866
<i>So his idea was to, sort of, do things
that were socially, sort of, giving.</i>

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:53.041
<i>I'd offered all the four members of
The Who...</i>

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:57.207
<i>...ten percent each of Track Records.</i>

01:35:57.418 --> 01:36:00.718
<i>The idea was that Track Records
would become, like, the bigger company.</i>

01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:05.655
<i>They would be partners in it,
and that they would come into the fold.</i>

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:11.924
<i>Our roles as managers and, sort of,
day-to-day, sort of, studio producers...</i>

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:14.159
...would fade into something else...

01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:17.599
...as they become bigger,
to be part of this thing.

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:19.467
And they refused this.

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:21.869
<i>It was a gift to say to these guys:</i>

01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:25.240
"We are tired of this job and
we're not so together anymore."

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:29.178
You know, "Come in and
help us in a different way."

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:33.478
And, you know, what we weren't good at
was we weren't good at the psychology.

01:36:33.687 --> 01:36:36.088
Because, you know,
we were saying to them:

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:39.283
"We don't want to be your managers
anymore, come in to Track."

01:36:39.493 --> 01:36:41.655
And they took it badly.

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:44.327
<i>I've had conversation with Roger
subsequently...</i>

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:47.127
<i>...and, um, I mean,
he's just very emotional.</i>

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:51.135
<i>I mean, he'd created the band,
more or less. He's the leader of the band.</i>

01:36:51.338 --> 01:36:54.797
<i>He'd had a terrible time because that was
taken away from him, you know?</i>

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.409
<i>The leadership, per se.</i>

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:59.478
<i>And he was really concerned...</i>

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.311
<i>...that, like, the way that Kit
and I were, in our drug using...</i>

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:09.786
<i>...or whatever it was,
that a lot of damage would be done.</i>

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:12.983
<i>The early '70s
coincided with two things.</i>

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:18.826
<i>You know, one was The Who becoming
a road war machine, and the other...</i>

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:21.468
...with Kit Lambert becoming
a heroin addict.

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:27.973
In 1973, he explained that he was
in a bad way, and he admitted...

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:31.634
...he was taking a lot of drugs,
and he wanted...

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:36.045
He asked me if I would
represent his interests.

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:39.584
And I said, "Look, I really am not
cut out for this kind of thing."

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:44.651
<i>And I helped Bill Curbishley
organize a European tour...</i>

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:48.694
<i>...sometime in sixty...
In '74, I think it was.</i>

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:50.728
I have to say I was not cut out for it.

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:54.198
Um, and it was difficult to talk
to Kit about it at that time...

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:57.701
...because if I tried to ask him questions,
"Now, what do you think?

01:37:57.905 --> 01:38:01.842
<i>How should we... What sort of
percentage should we ask for The Who?"</i>

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:05.069
<i>He didn't want to talk about that.
He wanted to talk about something else.</i>

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:08.215
He didn't seem to want
to talk about business at all.

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:15.783
<i>In 19... Was it '74? I had to instigate...</i>

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:19.619
...leaving them as managers,
because it was so out of control.

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:22.355
<i>Not, um...</i>

01:38:23.864 --> 01:38:26.129
<i>Not an easy decision.</i>

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:29.496
<i>The Who have become
a multimillion-pound corporation.</i>

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:32.696
<i>Their business empire is based
here at Shepperton Studios...</i>

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:36.935
<i>...where their trucking, laser and sound
equipment businesses are housed.</i>

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:41.275
<i>During the last few years, The Who's
other interests have diversified so much...</i>

01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:45.953
<i>...that people have wondered whether
they're musicians or businessmen.</i>

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:51.892
<i>Director Ken Russell
and producer Robert Stigwood...</i>

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:54.084
<i>...have made a film of</i> Tommy.

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:58.260
<i>Kit saw my betrayal
as</i> Tommy <i>the film.</i>

01:38:58.465 --> 01:39:02.129
<i>The unspoken deal was that him and...
You know, Lambert and Stamp...</i>

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:05.898
<i>...would make the rock film.
And when I went with Stigwood...</i>

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:09.133
<i>And I went with him because
it was still difficult at that stage.</i>

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:11.141
<i>Elton John, Eric Clapton...</i>

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:15.248
<i>So Stigwood equals Ken Russell
equaled Columbia, and that's basically it.</i>

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:19.250
<i>And then Stigwood said to me, um,
you know, "But I can't have Kit around."</i>

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:21.081
<i>Your senses will never be the same.</i>

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:23.416
<i>And when Kit was going
slightly mad, slightly off the wall...</i>

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:27.117
<i>...more eccentric than normal,
he got very frightened of Kit.</i>

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:33.159
<i>Kit felt sort of rejected by me.</i>

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:35.199
<i>He felt rejected by Pete.</i>

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:37.265
He didn't feel rejected by Keith.

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:41.306
Keith made it very clear
that he was there for him, you know?

01:39:41.508 --> 01:39:47.470
But he... But the two... The two poles
in his life were Pete and me. Ahem.

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:51.618
If I tried to deal with him, he would be
firing pieces of handwritten paper at me...

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:55.119
...which were the writs that he was
gonna smack on the film.

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:56.483
He somehow let go.

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:59.387
This kind of classic addiction,
alcoholic stuff.

01:39:59.626 --> 01:40:03.722
Unable to hang on to reality,
but just falling into...

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:06.661
...you know, deep, deep, deep anger
and resentment.

01:40:06.867 --> 01:40:10.463
You know, deeply felt resentment,
which eats and eats and eats away...

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:15.041
...and in the end, you know,
you're the one that gets it.

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:16.603
<i>It's a drag.</i>

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:19.143
<i>I'm... I'm still functioning.</i>

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:22.043
<i>I'm the one who's functioning.
Kit isn't functioning.</i>

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:26.345
<i>His life was getting incredibly
complicated. He'd lost his house...</i>

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.619
<i>Um, being a ward of the court,
he didn't have...</i>

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:32.691
<i>...the freedom to access his money
and all those things, right?</i>

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:35.886
<i>Well, his view of me
changed around...</i>

01:40:36.063 --> 01:40:38.999
<i>Um, he was getting slightly paranoid.</i>

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:42.692
<i>He didn't think he was being confided in
and respected in the way...</i>

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:45.429
<i>...he thought he should be
by The Who, whatever, right?</i>

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:49.871
<i>He's paranoid. Paranoid is a paranoia.
It's a type of mental illness, right?</i>

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:54.378
<i>It's the same as, like, being a
mentally-ill alcoholic or an addict, right?</i>

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:58.585
<i>You're not quite in touch with reality,
per se.</i>

01:40:58.652 --> 01:41:02.453
And at the end of that,
Roger and I had to kind of...

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:05.955
...just face the fact that it was
kind of up to us really.

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:10.028
You know, and that was hard,
that was a hard lesson...

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:13.689
...because we'd never really
established a proper, sort of, working...

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.563
You know, a way of working together.

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:20.469
Kit had been the intermediary, you know?
He was who we worked for. Through.

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:23.905
You know, we struggled and I don't think
we ever really found a way...

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:28.048
...of working together that was as good
as having him there.

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:39.090
<i>♪ I went to Dallas back in '82 ♪♪</i>

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:40.420
<i>Keith was in California.</i>

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:42.619
<i>I stayed with him in California,
he was going through a bad time.</i>

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:46.631
<i>I stayed in his house, was there for him.
I tried to get his record together.</i>

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:49.326
<i>I tried to like clean him up
as best as I could, right?</i>

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:52.301
<i>Whatever it was.
I was just there as his friend, right?</i>

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:54.105
<i>He moved in with Kit.</i>

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.767
<i>Right? At one time, and then...</i>

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:59.208
<i>...he also would
come over to my house.</i>

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:04.578
<i>In the complaint from The Who
to the various companies, right...</i>

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:07.755
<i>I mean, the time
it was originally signed...</i>

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:11.357
<i>...it was only actually signed
by Roger and John.</i>

01:42:11.592 --> 01:42:14.790
<i>So Pete had eventually
gone along with it.</i>

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:20.229
But Keith had been
the one member of the group...

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:24.303
...who refused to sign
those legal documents...

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.337
...against Kit and I.

01:42:26.673 --> 01:42:29.973
He said, "I'm not gonna sign anything
to do with hurting Kit or Chris."

01:42:31.044 --> 01:42:34.845
<i>So we had one meeting where Keith
and the whole group were there.</i>

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:37.745
<i>And Sam Sylvester
was listing off the things...</i>

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:41.251
<i>...that were on the original complaint.</i>

01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:45.324
<i>And every time there was
something about Kit and Chris...</i>

01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:47.495
<i>...Keith would answer.</i>

01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:50.194
<i>When money was missing,
"No, you don't understand.</i>

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:53.060
<i>Kit and Chris had to spend money
getting me out of prison.</i>

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.893
<i>Kit and Chris had to..."
You know?</i>

01:42:55.135 --> 01:42:58.503
<i>He was the best defense lawyer
on our behalf.</i>

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:02.372
<i>Um, so, when...</i>

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.411
<i>...um, he died...</i>

01:43:06.914 --> 01:43:08.314
<i>The Who, with their lawyers...</i>

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:11.417
<i>...wanted to get together with me
the day after the funeral.</i>

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.081
<i>They came here, right?</i>

01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:16.347
<i>To Shepperton Studios,
where Kit and I met.</i>

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:20.157
<i>The Who own
Shepperton Studios, right?</i>

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:23.086
<i>And so... But that was
the symbol of Keith dying...</i>

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.162
<i>...and then this meeting.</i>

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:30.702
<i>So when I walked in here,
into this boardroom, at Shepperton here...</i>

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:33.032
<i>...that was my frame of mind.</i>

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:35.732
<i>And we waited about...
It was over half an hour.</i>

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:38.708
<i>And the person who lived nearest
to Shepperton was Pete...</i>

01:43:38.912 --> 01:43:40.210
<i>...and he was the one that was late.</i>

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:42.038
<i>We're in the old house
having this meeting...</i>

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:43.410
...discussing the management, right?

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:46.382
I'm there with my lawyer, in a raincoat,
my one lawyer.

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:49.216
<i>There's a bank of lawyers
on the other side of the table.</i>

01:43:49.423 --> 01:43:52.359
And this is going on and, like...

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:55.028
...I'm getting more and more crazy...

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.721
...that I'm being sued
for mismanagement, right?

01:43:57.931 --> 01:44:02.926
Kit isn't there, Kit didn't show up.
I don't have my support around me.

01:44:03.136 --> 01:44:04.434
<i>Kit is not doing well.</i>

01:44:05.439 --> 01:44:07.237
<i>My life is pretty fucked up...</i>

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:10.240
<i>...and my wife is...
You know, I'm not with my wife.</i>

01:44:10.444 --> 01:44:13.471
<i>And for me, in that state of mind
that I was in...</i>

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:19.383
<i>I just didn't want to continue anymore.
And so that was in my mind.</i>

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:22.119
<i>I'm looking at this place...</i>

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:26.657
<i>...this studio that, um,
Kit and I met at, right...</i>

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:28.725
<i>...that The Who now own.</i>

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:31.125
<i>Right? And I stood up and I said:</i>

01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:35.359
"Do you call this fucking
mismanagement?" Right?

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:39.301
You know, referring to...
They own Shepperton Studios.

01:44:39.873 --> 01:44:43.366
I mean, what is fabulous management?

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:45.011
This is mismanagement? Right?

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:48.511
Anyway, I was trying to do
the best I could.

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:51.251
<i>But the best I could...</i>

01:44:51.451 --> 01:44:55.946
<i>...didn't include Kit...</i>

01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:59.490
<i>...because I couldn't get him
to the table.</i>

01:44:59.926 --> 01:45:01.588
<i>I was a manager...</i>

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:04.488
<i>...and I wasn't able to hold my ground.</i>

01:45:05.032 --> 01:45:06.967
<i>It's like, you know...</i>

01:45:07.167 --> 01:45:10.604
<i>...you can't get the lighting right,
and you're the cameraman.</i>

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:13.269
<i>That's what I was doing.</i>

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:16.409
<i>I didn't have film in the camera.
You know.</i>

01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:18.806
I knew that there was no way...

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:25.543
...to, sort of,
nicely move through this impasse.

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:30.986
So I just, as sensibly as I could...

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:36.425
...I tried to resolve a way
to just sign off from these guys.

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:38.792
<i>Because I was in the studio...</i>

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:41.332
<i>...and because this is where
Kit and I first met...</i>

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:44.699
<i>...and it was just so...
It was all overwhelming.</i>

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:47.999
<i>So this place
of the beginning of all things...</i>

01:45:48.208 --> 01:45:49.471
<i>...in my young life...</i>

01:45:49.676 --> 01:45:53.010
<i>Becoming an assistant director
at Shepperton for the first time...</i>

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:54.306
<i>...and all of that...</i>

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:58.315
<i>...it had all just ended up
like this, you know?</i>

01:45:58.952 --> 01:46:01.387
When I thought about them,
I... "Fuck them," you know?

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:04.387
I hated them. You know, "Scumbags."
There wasn't any...

01:46:04.591 --> 01:46:06.457
It was always like resentment.

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.720
I was angry, I was hurt,
I was pissed off.

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:13.058
You know, I was full of self-pity.
It was all this shit I hadn't done, right?

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:15.326
"These little fuckers,"
you know what I mean?

01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:19.028
Like, I didn't get to make...
I didn't even direct <i>Tommy,</i> you know?

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:29.214
<i>Kit told me his father died...</i>

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:32.285
<i>...at 45...</i>

01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:35.284
<i>...and that he thought
he would die at 45 as well.</i>

01:46:38.525 --> 01:46:41.051
<i>On my 45th birthday, um...</i>

01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:44.390
<i>...I woke up in a detox.</i>

01:46:44.598 --> 01:46:46.624
<i>Which I had gone to, right,
you know, specifically.</i>

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.291
<i>And I was 45.</i>

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:51.130
<i>So, um, you know...</i>

01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:54.500
<i>...from that point on,
this idea of recovery...</i>

01:46:54.708 --> 01:46:57.610
<i>...of being a sober guy, began.</i>

01:46:57.944 --> 01:46:59.276
<i>It began.</i>

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:12.916
- Should we walk down to Kit's?
- Okay, fine. Fine, fine. Okay.

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:20.598
<i>There's someone in
the audience who is a really, really...</i>

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:23.293
<i>Man who's very special in my life...</i>

01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:27.338
<i>...because The Who
would never have been...</i>

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:30.806
<i>...I'm sure, ever successful
without the help...</i>

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:34.547
<i>...of two special people.</i>

01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:37.547
<i>In those days when we started,
we were a little band...</i>

01:47:37.751 --> 01:47:39.686
...and two people joined us.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.151
There was Kit Lambert
and there was Chris Stamp.

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:45.819
Sadly,
Kit isn't around anymore...

01:47:46.059 --> 01:47:48.494
...but Chris Stamp is here tonight.

01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:52.160
- And...
- Sit down so he can see you.

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:55.259
I love him dearly
and I've got to tell you...

01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:56.664
...they were so important.

01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:59.369
<i>They were the fifth and sixth
members of this band.</i>

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:02.974
<i>They formed the shell of the egg
that you know as The Who these days.</i>

01:48:03.176 --> 01:48:04.804
<i>They guided us in every way.</i>

01:48:06.112 --> 01:48:09.378
<i>And what Chris was really good at,
was he was the ideas man.</i>

01:48:09.616 --> 01:48:12.677
<i>He was the juggler,
he was the magician saying:</i>

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:15.515
<i>"They can't just do an album.
We've gotta be on the ball.</i>

01:48:15.722 --> 01:48:17.987
<i>We gotta do something
that's ahead of the curve."</i>

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:19.887
It was so lovely
to see you out there.

01:48:20.126 --> 01:48:21.492
- Yeah, no, it was fucking great, man.
- It really was.

01:48:21.695 --> 01:48:24.130
I was, like... You know,
I was near tears all the time.

01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:26.197
You know what I mean?
Because I was full.

01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:29.494
I'm not mentioning it,
but I loved all the shit you said about me.

01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:32.195
- Ha-ha-ha. I don't want to...
- Really, mate?

01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:35.034
- I don't want to appear... Yes, yes, yes!
- True.

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:37.541
And then, okay, I got sober. Right?

01:48:38.912 --> 01:48:42.349
<i>I mean, and by the act of getting sober,
whatever that means...</i>

01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:45.348
<i>What it meant for me was,
you know, I expanded somewhat...</i>

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:49.387
<i>...and started to sort of like,
own myself, for what I was, right?</i>

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:53.219
<i>You know, and that was just
a part of my life that was in the past.</i>

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:55.691
<i>I wasn't letting it
live in me now, you know.</i>

01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:57.489
<i>I wasn't, like, festering over it.</i>

01:48:57.697 --> 01:48:58.926
<i>And then Roger called me.</i>

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:01.327
Right? Roger called me.
I think Pete called me.

01:49:01.535 --> 01:49:04.027
I don't think they called me
for any particular reason.

01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:06.536
Roger was... Roger...

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:11.508
Roger, he had all sorts of ideas
that he wanted to talk to me about.

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:13.540
You know.

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:16.239
So we talked about the ideas, right?

01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:18.711
<i>You know,
he made amends with his part.</i>

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:21.354
<i>I sort of said, well,
the same for me, you know?</i>

01:49:21.788 --> 01:49:25.782
<i>I owned how I've left him behind.
It wasn't one-sided.</i>

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:28.188
<i>And the first idea that came up
between Roger and I...</i>

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:30.694
...was he wanted to make a film
about Keith Moon.

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:32.729
And that seemed a way
to move forward.

01:49:32.933 --> 01:49:35.061
<i>It was a film,
it was another film, you know.</i>

01:49:35.268 --> 01:49:37.396
<i>And so, we got a script organized.</i>

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:40.540
<i>We got it out to Hollywood, you know?</i>

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.642
<i>We raised money.</i>

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:53.243
<i>Well, The Who are being honored...</i>

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:57.481
<i>...it's called
the Kennedy Center Awards.</i>

01:49:57.991 --> 01:49:59.459
<i>You're given an award...</i>

01:49:59.693 --> 01:50:04.791
<i>...it's an outstanding contribution
to the arts and culture.</i>

01:50:05.398 --> 01:50:10.996
You know, I can also say
that I was still happy they got it, right?

01:50:11.237 --> 01:50:14.105
I was genuinely happy they got it.
I wasn't sort of like:

01:50:14.307 --> 01:50:17.436
"Yeah the fuckers, they've sold out."
I didn't think like that.

01:50:17.644 --> 01:50:20.580
<i>The invitation came
directly from Roger.</i>

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:23.249
<i>He was very gracious and very loving.</i>

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:27.945
You know, Roger has an understanding that
this group of people, alive and dead...

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:31.124
...you know, where the centerpiece...

01:50:31.324 --> 01:50:34.089
...is something bigger than all of us,
you know?

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:36.854
And Roger understands that
in a very, sort of, deep way.

01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:39.964
And so he, with a lot of love
and a lot of graciousness...

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:43.603
...insisted that I come.

01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:46.499
<i>And I was happy to accept, you know?</i>

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:49.505
<i>Because it's about something
we were all involved with.</i>

01:50:49.743 --> 01:50:52.542
<i>I mean, Kit is dead,
Keith's dead, John's dead...</i>

01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:56.616
<i>But overall, the people
who were here today...</i>

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:59.877
...the three of us here today, of
that era... And Bill Curbishley...

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.385
...who's been here since,
as the manager figure...

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:04.784
<i>...have been involved in this process.</i>

01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:08.686
<i>Pete said something which I loved.</i>

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:12.195
<i>He said, "As I wrote on
what The Who performed for...</i>

01:51:12.399 --> 01:51:15.198
<i>...the people who liked us
felt seen and heard." Right?</i>

01:51:15.402 --> 01:51:19.169
He said, "Now that the fucking
privileged understand and like my lyrics...

01:51:19.372 --> 01:51:21.398
...why the fuck
am I still writing them?"

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:24.844
<i>I didn't want my life to be like,
well, I didn't get to make</i> Tommy...

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:27.776
<i>...I didn't get to make The Who film,
and I'm not making the Keith Moon film.</i>

01:51:27.981 --> 01:51:30.883
Right? So perhaps
I shouldn't be making fucking films.

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:34.647
You know,
perhaps that's not in the picture.

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:37.551
<i>You know, I mean,
it was obviously not working, right?</i>

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:39.384
<i>I hadn't pulled one out of the bag.</i>

01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:41.993
I hadn't directed
this fucking great masterpiece...

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:45.688
...that I'd been carrying around me
since I'm like 16 or whatever it was.

01:51:46.032 --> 01:51:48.228
Isn't that wild? The White House.

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:52.338
<i>A lot of things we could've done,
and should have done, and didn't do...</i>

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:56.101
...but we, you know, we did enough.
You know, we spurred each other on.

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:59.835
We were sort of, like...
You know, we were loving, man.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.209
We were loving to each other,
you know?

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:06.409
It's very difficult to,
sort of, know, you know...

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:10.078
...the moments that you love someone
a lot of the time.

01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:14.953
<i>Yeah, love is giving.</i>

01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:18.854
<i>Get a bit of love in your life,
you could give a little bit, right?</i>

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:22.866
<i>It's called intimacy, you know, and all...</i>

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:26.631
We want to naturally back off
from all that shit, right?

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:31.477
And Kit Lambert, Chris Stamp,
Pete Townshend...

01:52:31.711 --> 01:52:34.112
...Roger Daltrey,
Keith Moon and John Entwistle...

01:52:34.347 --> 01:52:37.977
...didn't quite back off
for a long period of time, you know?

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:44.289
We all thought we were sort of
keeping our so-called "individual cool"...

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:45.891
...but we weren't, you know?

01:52:46.659 --> 01:52:48.753
We were there for each other...

01:52:48.962 --> 01:52:50.590
...you know, in an un-heroic way...

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:53.232
...in a sensitive, frightening way.

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:55.595
Sensitive and frightening.

01:52:55.802 --> 01:52:58.294
Just gonna pull your jacket so...

01:52:58.505 --> 01:53:00.770
It's about to roll out.

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:02.772
- Is that the end of the roll?
- Yeah.

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:04.740
