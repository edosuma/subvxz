WEBVTT

00:00.748 --> 00:02.282
I think it's brilliant.

00:02.317 --> 00:04.585
It's not even
a good clown makeup.

00:04.619 --> 00:06.753
It's a beautiful,
beautiful design.

00:06.788 --> 00:08.755
Thank you.

00:08.790 --> 00:10.257
Previously, on <i>Face Off,</i>

00:10.291 --> 00:13.827
the judges fell in love
with Emily's queen of hearts,

00:13.862 --> 00:15.596
but Daniel was eliminated,

00:15.630 --> 00:18.699
leaving only three artists
on Team Anthony.

00:20.768 --> 00:23.303
Now, 12 artists remain,
and tonight,

00:23.338 --> 00:26.406
their stamina is tested
with two intense challenges.

00:26.441 --> 00:27.674
It's relay race time.

00:27.709 --> 00:29.943
I'm a makeup artist,
not an athlete.

00:29.978 --> 00:31.078
Ahh!

00:31.112 --> 00:32.713
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm freaking out.

00:32.747 --> 00:34.214
Is he a good guy
or is he a bad guy?

00:34.249 --> 00:36.483
- There's a lot of blank stares.
- [Sighs]

00:36.517 --> 00:39.119
We do have business
to attend to.

00:39.153 --> 00:42.456
- What?
- What is going on?

00:43.491 --> 00:45.459
You did an amazing job.

00:45.493 --> 00:47.861
In the end, only one will win
a VIP trip

00:47.896 --> 00:49.363
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

00:49.397 --> 00:52.165
to one of their
85 international locations,

00:52.200 --> 00:55.202
a brand new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:55.236 --> 00:57.537
and $100,000.

01:42.417 --> 01:44.618
[Overlapping chatter]

01:44.652 --> 01:46.720
- Okay.
- So we walk into the lab,

01:46.754 --> 01:48.822
and I see that there are
these four makeup stations

01:48.856 --> 01:50.357
that look like lanes.

01:50.358 --> 01:51.358
What is this?

01:52.493 --> 01:55.228
- Hey, guys.
All: - Hi.

01:55.263 --> 01:58.765
So life on a Hollywood set
can be pure chaos,

01:58.800 --> 02:01.401
and sometimes, that means
having to hand off your work

02:01.436 --> 02:03.303
to someone else
to finish the job,

02:03.338 --> 02:05.739
and that's exactly
what you'll be doing today.

02:05.773 --> 02:08.375
- It's relay race time.
- Oh, yeah.

02:08.408 --> 02:10.143
I don't feel to good about this,

02:10.178 --> 02:13.213
'cause I'm a makeup artist,
not an athlete.

02:13.247 --> 02:15.015
You'll be working
in teams of three,

02:15.049 --> 02:18.318
and each team member will get
two 20 minute turns.

02:18.353 --> 02:21.455
When I call, "Switch,"
at the end of your first turn,

02:21.489 --> 02:23.657
you need to grab
a new prosthetic

02:23.691 --> 02:25.759
and hand it off
to your teammate.

02:25.793 --> 02:28.128
That new piece
must be incorporated

02:28.162 --> 02:30.297
into your team's overall design.

02:30.331 --> 02:31.631
Oh, my God.

02:31.666 --> 02:33.233
While you're working,
you will not be able

02:33.267 --> 02:35.902
to communicate
with your team at all.

02:35.937 --> 02:38.138
So you'll find out
what you're dealing with

02:38.172 --> 02:39.873
when you come
around the back side

02:39.907 --> 02:41.708
of one of these makeup stations.

02:41.743 --> 02:44.177
Now, you're going to need
a little inspiration

02:44.212 --> 02:45.946
for your makeups.

02:48.383 --> 02:51.084
All: Oh.

02:51.119 --> 02:53.220
From Freddy Krueger
in <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i>

02:53.254 --> 02:54.788
to <i> Edward Scissorhands,</i>

02:54.822 --> 02:56.723
claws have played
a significant role

02:56.758 --> 02:59.359
in defining
iconic movie characters.

02:59.394 --> 03:02.429
So you will use
your model's claws

03:02.463 --> 03:05.932
as inspiration
for an original character.

03:05.967 --> 03:08.435
The winner of today's challenge
will earn immunity...

03:08.469 --> 03:09.636
Ooh.

03:09.670 --> 03:10.804
And cannot be eliminated

03:10.838 --> 03:12.606
in this week's
spotlight challenge.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.807
I want that immunity

03:13.841 --> 03:15.342
because I've been
in the bottom twice,

03:15.376 --> 03:16.943
and I know I'm better
than what I've been able

03:16.978 --> 03:20.080
to accomplish so far.

03:20.114 --> 03:21.481
Your guest judge this week

03:21.516 --> 03:24.618
is the co-host
of ABC's hit show <i> Wipeout,</i>

03:24.652 --> 03:27.954
and one of the stars
of MTV's <i> Teen Wolf.</i>

03:27.989 --> 03:31.058
Please give a warm welcome
to Jill Wagner.

03:33.661 --> 03:35.729
It's really cool
to have Jill Wagner here

03:35.763 --> 03:38.298
because she knows how it feels
to be in prosthetics

03:38.332 --> 03:40.300
and understands
the importance of makeup

03:40.334 --> 03:42.302
in creating
a cohesive character.

03:42.336 --> 03:43.770
So Jill, you have
some claws of your own.

03:43.805 --> 03:45.405
You're a were-jaguar.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.240
I do... Which are
totally different claws,

03:47.275 --> 03:48.408
by the way, than a werewolf.

03:48.443 --> 03:49.843
Exactly.
Good point.

03:49.877 --> 03:51.278
So what are you gonna be
looking for today?

03:51.312 --> 03:53.547
Everything has to flow.
It's got to look like

03:53.581 --> 03:56.349
your claw belongs
with the rest of the character,

03:56.384 --> 03:58.418
but the most important thing
for me

03:58.453 --> 04:00.987
is the detailing in the makeup,

04:01.022 --> 04:02.422
particularly the mouth.

04:02.457 --> 04:03.723
All right, everybody,

04:03.758 --> 04:06.526
your teams and stations
have been randomly assigned.

04:06.561 --> 04:10.730
Head back to the starting lines
and stand with your teammates.

04:10.765 --> 04:12.899
On your mark, get set,

04:12.934 --> 04:14.134
- go!
- Ahh!

04:14.168 --> 04:16.503
Oh, geez.

04:16.536 --> 04:17.671
What's up, man? I'm Logan.
I can't shake your hand.

04:17.704 --> 04:19.439
You have stuff all over it.

04:19.474 --> 04:22.676
Our claws have a lot
of colorful, mechanical parts,

04:22.710 --> 04:24.911
and I think,
"Toy factory, cyborg."

04:24.946 --> 04:26.346
- Yeah.
- Tip your head back.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.681
So I apply a bald cap...

04:27.715 --> 04:29.015
Ready for this?

04:29.050 --> 04:31.384
And lay down a gear prosthetic
right on the forehead.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.688
- This is exciting.
- [Chuckles]

04:34.722 --> 04:39.459
I see these amazing,
bedazzled out in gold cat claws,

04:39.494 --> 04:41.561
so I think,
"Egyptian cat goddess."

04:42.930 --> 04:44.764
Let me see those claws.

04:44.799 --> 04:47.467
We've got these
Freddy Krueger-looking claws,

04:47.502 --> 04:49.202
so the first thing
I could think of is

04:49.237 --> 04:51.238
maybe he's cutting himself.

04:51.272 --> 04:53.507
I find a prosthetic,
and it's got all these cracks,

04:53.541 --> 04:55.842
and I start applying it
to his face.

04:55.877 --> 04:57.377
It makes scars
and some open wounds.

04:57.411 --> 04:59.412
So I'm just setting
a foundation for my team.

04:59.447 --> 05:01.414
I have no idea what's going on,

05:01.449 --> 05:02.883
and it's excruciating,
knowing I'm up next.

05:05.453 --> 05:09.789
We get these sparkly,
icy fingers,

05:09.824 --> 05:11.691
so I first think, "Ice queen,"

05:11.726 --> 05:14.628
and I'm gonna have
this really pointy, evil brow,

05:14.662 --> 05:19.399
and I need to also grab
the next appliance for Adam.

05:19.433 --> 05:20.634
Switch!

05:23.471 --> 05:24.905
What the hell is it?

05:24.939 --> 05:26.940
I look at the prosthetic
Logan hands me,

05:26.974 --> 05:29.609
and it's a set of teeth
with, like,

05:29.644 --> 05:31.678
more mechanical stuff
underneath it,

05:31.712 --> 05:33.947
and I see gears
on our model's head,

05:33.981 --> 05:35.949
and it triggers cyborg for me.

05:35.983 --> 05:37.450
That's pretty cool.

05:38.719 --> 05:41.221
It is, but you have
a nose piece in your brow.

05:41.255 --> 05:43.823
I remember Jill's comment
about details around the mouth,

05:43.858 --> 05:46.193
and I just create
a little chin piece out of it.

05:47.395 --> 05:49.329
Oh, I get it.

05:49.363 --> 05:52.566
Ben gave me
a set of eye bag prosthetics,

05:52.600 --> 05:55.335
but I decide to use
these as blender pieces

05:55.369 --> 05:57.370
to cover up some of the edges,

05:57.405 --> 06:00.106
and I notice that there's
some really thick edges

06:00.141 --> 06:02.342
along his brow area,

06:02.376 --> 06:05.345
so I find a piece
that will cover that

06:05.379 --> 06:07.547
for Emily to apply.

06:07.582 --> 06:10.283
I can tell that Anthony's going
for some kind of Egyptian style,

06:10.318 --> 06:12.385
so I start gluing down
the horns on the chin

06:12.420 --> 06:14.521
to add some kind of silhouette.

06:16.324 --> 06:18.091
It's getting down to the end
of my turn,

06:18.125 --> 06:20.460
and my concept is an alien diva,

06:20.494 --> 06:22.395
but I don't know
how to tell Rob,

06:22.430 --> 06:24.297
so I grab some blues,
whites, and silvers,

06:24.332 --> 06:26.199
and I hope rob gets the message.

06:26.234 --> 06:27.300
Then I grab a set of horns.

06:27.335 --> 06:28.902
Perfect.

06:28.936 --> 06:30.503
Switch!

06:33.074 --> 06:35.308
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:35.343 --> 06:36.977
I hope she doesn't take
what I gave her too literally.

06:37.011 --> 06:39.246
Stephanie has handed me
a full face,

06:39.280 --> 06:41.181
and I kind of know
where they're going with it.

06:41.215 --> 06:42.515
Somebody's been torn up.

06:42.550 --> 06:44.584
So I'm like, "Okay,
I got to Frankenstein this."

06:44.619 --> 06:46.486
What is he supposed to be?

06:46.520 --> 06:48.021
I have a little nose prosthetic.

06:48.055 --> 06:50.957
I think Darla wants me
to cover up the edges

06:50.992 --> 06:52.292
around the eyes...

06:52.326 --> 06:53.426
Perfect.

06:53.461 --> 06:55.662
So I apply the nose piece
very quickly,

06:55.696 --> 06:57.931
and I just start painting.

06:57.965 --> 06:59.966
I see Adam grab the paints,

07:00.001 --> 07:02.535
and I start laying down
Kryolan Aquacolor.

07:03.604 --> 07:04.971
Switch!

07:08.509 --> 07:10.343
You are looking
like a beast, man.

07:10.378 --> 07:12.545
At this point, this is obviously
a wounded character,

07:12.580 --> 07:14.581
so we're just gonna burn him up.

07:19.186 --> 07:20.287
Switch!

07:22.156 --> 07:23.356
Hi.

07:23.391 --> 07:24.357
What do we got?
What do we got? What do we got?

07:24.392 --> 07:26.893
Oh, shit.
What in the...

07:32.667 --> 07:33.967
Switch!

07:42.576 --> 07:45.412
Time, guys!
That's it, brushes down!

07:45.446 --> 07:47.647
[Applause]

07:47.682 --> 07:50.721
Tell us about the concept
that you created with the claws you got.

07:50.755 --> 07:52.022
First thing
that I could think of was,

07:52.056 --> 07:53.357
"He's always picking
at himself,"

07:53.391 --> 07:54.624
so I found something
that looked like

07:54.659 --> 07:56.293
it had already been cut.

07:56.327 --> 07:57.894
- And then, we all added...
Both: - Yeah.

07:57.929 --> 07:59.629
layers of paint to it to create

07:59.664 --> 08:01.331
extra depth within the piece.

08:01.366 --> 08:03.600
Overall, it's great.
The cracks and everything,

08:03.634 --> 08:05.669
they're really good,
but I just would like to see

08:05.703 --> 08:10.841
just a little more originality,
but he looks like his claws.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.210
- It matches.
- Thanks.

08:13.244 --> 08:16.179
I immediately thought doing
an Egyptian cat goddess.

08:16.214 --> 08:18.281
What made you put
the horns right there?

08:18.316 --> 08:19.883
I could just tell
that Anthony wanted the bangs

08:19.917 --> 08:21.985
to be flowing down, and
I didn't want to interrupt that,

08:22.019 --> 08:24.187
so I thought the chin would be
the place to put them.

08:24.222 --> 08:26.323
I love the coloring,
love her lips,

08:26.357 --> 08:28.492
but where the horn comes out

08:28.526 --> 08:31.628
needs to be blended
a little bit better.

08:31.662 --> 08:35.765
This is Ivan, he was involved
in a toy factory explosion.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.001
All the bits were seared
into his face.

08:38.034 --> 08:40.404
I love the whole story
of this one.

08:40.438 --> 08:41.538
He looks scary.

08:41.572 --> 08:43.206
He would have terrified
the hell out of me.

08:43.241 --> 08:45.409
- Thank you.
- [Laughter]

08:45.443 --> 08:48.412
She's Princess Meg,
and she's a hostess

08:48.446 --> 08:49.946
for an intergalactic
music video show.

08:49.981 --> 08:53.049
I have to say, the wig was
a pretty bold choice.

08:53.084 --> 08:54.718
Who made that decision?

08:54.752 --> 08:56.153
When I saw how he went
with blue,

08:56.187 --> 08:58.889
I walked back there, and
I was like, "That's the one."

08:58.923 --> 09:01.024
I love the coloring.

09:01.058 --> 09:03.126
This is really cohesive.

09:03.161 --> 09:04.261
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

09:04.295 --> 09:06.630
So Jill, how did they do today?

09:06.664 --> 09:07.864
They did amazing.

09:07.899 --> 09:11.468
I love the characters
and originality.

09:11.502 --> 09:13.103
- Great job.
- All right, who created

09:13.137 --> 09:14.271
your favorite looks?

09:14.305 --> 09:16.306
Kelly, Adam, and Rob,

09:16.340 --> 09:18.008
'cause I love the way you guys

09:18.042 --> 09:20.677
made her beautiful
instead of scary.

09:20.711 --> 09:22.913
- She's uber-cool.
All: - Thank you.

09:22.947 --> 09:26.516
My other favorite was from
Logan, Stephanie, and Jamie.

09:26.551 --> 09:29.753
It was very cohesive
and creepy and scary.

09:29.787 --> 09:31.087
All: Thank you.

09:31.122 --> 09:33.757
All right, Jill,
so who has won immunity?

09:33.791 --> 09:37.527
The winner is...

09:37.562 --> 09:38.528
Adam.

09:38.563 --> 09:40.664
[Applause]

09:40.698 --> 09:42.165
[Laughs]

09:42.200 --> 09:43.834
The wig totally made
the character,

09:43.868 --> 09:46.102
and this little chin piece
was so unexpected,

09:46.137 --> 09:47.871
so congratulations, Adam.

09:47.905 --> 09:49.606
Thank you so much.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.741
I'm stoked,
because having immunity

09:51.776 --> 09:53.577
is gonna give me a chance
to do some things that

09:53.611 --> 09:56.980
I don't typically do without,
you know, the consequences.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.849
Jill, thank you so much
for being here.

09:58.883 --> 09:59.916
- Thank you so much.
- It was such a pleasure

09:59.951 --> 10:01.451
to have you.

10:01.486 --> 10:04.421
Bye.

10:04.455 --> 10:06.823
All right,
before I send you home,

10:06.858 --> 10:10.126
we do have a little bit
of business to attend to.

10:12.129 --> 10:14.631
What is going on?

10:14.665 --> 10:16.766
Rayce?

10:16.801 --> 10:19.736
- Hey, guys.
- What?

10:19.770 --> 10:22.772
Oh, man,
what's Rayce doing here?

10:27.630 --> 10:28.997
So why don't you fill them in?

10:30.366 --> 10:31.767
I have a big client that I have

10:31.801 --> 10:33.135
some prior commitments with,

10:33.169 --> 10:36.471
and I will not be able to attend
this spotlight challenge.

10:36.506 --> 10:38.740
But I've got
a <i> Face Off</i> rock star

10:38.775 --> 10:40.809
that is gonna come
help you guys out.

10:42.979 --> 10:45.414
- Hey.
- [Laughter]

10:45.448 --> 10:47.682
Hey, guys.

10:49.685 --> 10:50.919
- Ah.
- You look great.

10:50.953 --> 10:52.320
So good to see you.

10:52.355 --> 10:54.156
Thank you.
It's awesome to be here.

10:54.190 --> 10:55.991
All right, well,
you guys all remember RJ.

10:56.025 --> 10:58.427
So Rayce, how do you feel
about this guy

10:58.461 --> 10:59.594
stepping in while you're gone?

10:59.629 --> 11:00.996
Oh, I'm really excited.

11:01.030 --> 11:03.165
He's got an insane amount
of knowledge

11:03.199 --> 11:04.599
to help execute your makeups.

11:04.634 --> 11:06.334
All right, guys,
RJ will be in the lab

11:06.369 --> 11:08.036
with Anthony and Laura
in the morning,

11:08.070 --> 11:11.606
so we'll see you tomorrow for
your next spotlight challenge.

11:11.641 --> 11:13.675
It's gonna be really weird
not having Rayce around,

11:13.709 --> 11:15.911
but RJ's an amazing artist,

11:15.945 --> 11:18.447
so I'm really excited
to be working with him.

11:27.490 --> 11:30.258
We arrive at Fox Studios.

11:31.761 --> 11:34.830
I can just feel the history,
walking down these streets.

11:34.864 --> 11:37.165
It's so amazing.

11:42.271 --> 11:46.741
Welcome to the historic Newman
scoring stage at Fox Studios.

11:46.776 --> 11:50.345
Now, some of the most memorable
motion picture music ever

11:50.379 --> 11:53.248
was recorded right here
in this room.

11:53.282 --> 11:57.786
And this, of course, leads us to
your next spotlight challenge,

11:57.820 --> 12:01.523
which taps into an essential
element of movie magic,

12:01.557 --> 12:03.525
sound.

12:03.559 --> 12:05.327
Sound designers are often
involved

12:05.361 --> 12:07.262
before a creature
is even designed,

12:07.296 --> 12:10.665
meaning the sound
inspires the final creation.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.969
Your spotlight challenge
is to create a character

12:14.003 --> 12:16.271
inspired
by a unique sound effect.

12:16.305 --> 12:18.306
Ooh.

12:18.341 --> 12:19.774
I think that's awesome.

12:19.809 --> 12:21.142
This challenge is gonna
really show

12:21.177 --> 12:23.445
everyone's imagination
and what they can do.

12:23.479 --> 12:26.648
Now, you'll be working
together in teams of two,

12:26.682 --> 12:28.316
so go ahead and pair up.

12:31.420 --> 12:34.022
I'd like to introduce
a very special guest.

12:34.056 --> 12:36.992
He's earned five
Primetime Emmy nominations

12:37.026 --> 12:39.327
and two Academy Award
nominations

12:39.362 --> 12:41.229
for his sound design work.

12:41.264 --> 12:45.967
Please give a warm welcome
to sound designer Erik Aadahl.

12:46.002 --> 12:49.004
[Applause]

12:52.108 --> 12:53.308
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

12:53.342 --> 12:55.010
Oh, my pleasure.
It's great to be here.

12:55.044 --> 12:57.913
Well, I mean, you have built
quite an impressive resume.

12:57.947 --> 12:59.714
How do you find inspiration?

12:59.749 --> 13:01.416
When you're giving voice
to something,

13:01.450 --> 13:02.817
you're giving it its soul.

13:02.852 --> 13:06.454
So the job of the sound designer
is to illuminate that soul.

13:06.489 --> 13:10.325
So try to find the personality,
the environment, the genre,

13:10.359 --> 13:12.027
and play off of that.

13:12.061 --> 13:13.295
You will have
the unique pleasure

13:13.329 --> 13:16.431
of using original sounds
that Eric has created

13:16.465 --> 13:18.733
to inspire your designs
this week.

13:18.768 --> 13:20.235
That's real cool.

13:20.269 --> 13:23.104
They've been randomly assigned
and preloaded onto your tablets.

13:23.139 --> 13:25.774
This guy is a genius,

13:25.808 --> 13:29.344
and the fact that he is making
our sounds, that's awesome.

13:29.378 --> 13:31.513
- Thank you so much again.
- My pleasure.

13:31.547 --> 13:32.647
All right, guys,
your sound effects

13:32.682 --> 13:34.549
will play back
alongside your characters

13:34.584 --> 13:36.484
on the reveal stage
for the judges.

13:36.519 --> 13:38.987
So grab your tablets
and headphones

13:39.021 --> 13:41.356
and start conceptualizing
your creations.

13:45.995 --> 13:47.729
I think we should both
individually

13:47.763 --> 13:49.431
listen to the sound twice.

13:49.465 --> 13:54.035
[Growling effects]

13:54.070 --> 13:56.871
Rob and I get this rumbly,
roaring character

13:56.906 --> 13:59.107
that sounds like t-rex
with a cold.

13:59.141 --> 14:02.043
We want a large bog creature,
bigger than life.

14:02.078 --> 14:03.979
We want to make it
a head-to-toe piece.

14:04.013 --> 14:06.181
[Growling effects]

14:06.215 --> 14:08.116
It's this big, snarling,
snotty beast

14:08.150 --> 14:10.485
with a few different
nostril sets.

14:10.519 --> 14:11.753
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

14:15.257 --> 14:17.325
[Clicking effects]

14:17.360 --> 14:19.928
We hear, like,
these clicking noises,

14:19.962 --> 14:21.896
and then rustling and water.

14:21.931 --> 14:23.632
[Clicking effects]

14:23.666 --> 14:24.966
I'm thinking
very dinosaur-like.

14:25.001 --> 14:25.967
Mm-hmm.

14:26.002 --> 14:27.068
Our concept for our character

14:27.103 --> 14:30.105
is a prehistoric,
bird-like creature.

14:30.139 --> 14:31.406
[Clicking effects]

14:31.440 --> 14:32.774
It lives in the jungle,

14:32.808 --> 14:35.143
and it defends itself
by its quills.

14:40.216 --> 14:41.516
What are you thinking?

14:41.550 --> 14:44.019
I'm thinking
similar to full robot.

14:44.053 --> 14:46.821
We have something that
the other sounds don't have,

14:46.856 --> 14:48.456
which is words.

14:48.491 --> 14:50.058
[Humming effects]

14:50.092 --> 14:51.159
[Robotic voice]
Activated.

14:51.193 --> 14:54.663
[Humming effects]

14:54.697 --> 14:57.365
Weapon system armed.

14:57.400 --> 15:00.268
I don't want to do a robot.

15:00.302 --> 15:02.137
I think that it's too obvious.

15:02.171 --> 15:03.405
This is speaking to me, though.

15:03.439 --> 15:04.939
One-armed robot?

15:04.974 --> 15:06.441
That's been done before.

15:06.475 --> 15:09.878
- [Humming effects]
- Armed.

15:13.449 --> 15:18.253
[Growling effects]

15:18.287 --> 15:19.754
It sounds horror.

15:19.789 --> 15:21.690
Yeah, that's a terrifying sound.

15:21.724 --> 15:24.492
There's women screaming
and hollow ghost sounds

15:24.527 --> 15:26.394
and men groaning, and I'm like,

15:26.429 --> 15:28.430
"What the actual hell?"

15:28.464 --> 15:33.334
What if we did some form
of, like, demon banshee?

15:33.369 --> 15:36.004
The first thing that pops
into my head is Satan's servant.

15:36.038 --> 15:37.572
He's able to grasp
onto their souls

15:37.606 --> 15:39.541
and drag them down into Hell.

15:39.575 --> 15:41.309
[Growling and screaming effects]

15:41.343 --> 15:44.279
The character's face
is definitely gonna be demonic,

15:44.313 --> 15:46.815
but then, all down his chest,

15:46.849 --> 15:49.417
we're gonna have
these sort of ghostly figures.

15:49.452 --> 15:52.554
It sounds like multiple things
happening at the same time.

15:52.588 --> 15:54.422
So basically, Anthony and I
are gonna make Hell.

15:57.126 --> 15:59.360
All right, everybody,
let's go back to the lab.

16:11.173 --> 16:12.841
Like the clockmaker's wife
or something,

16:12.875 --> 16:15.510
and she died or something
so he put her back together.

16:15.544 --> 16:17.612
Ticking is really prominent
in our sound,

16:17.646 --> 16:20.949
and we decide that we're not
gonna do the clockmaker,

16:20.983 --> 16:22.784
but do the clockmaker's wife.

16:22.818 --> 16:24.352
[Clock effects]

16:24.386 --> 16:28.289
She dies and he ends up making
a porcelain clockwork doll

16:28.324 --> 16:29.958
that looks like her.

16:29.992 --> 16:32.260
But maybe we can make her,
like, '50s housewife.

16:34.163 --> 16:35.163
I'm digging this.

16:38.701 --> 16:41.636
I really, really want to focus
on the detail on this guy.

16:41.670 --> 16:43.271
I'm gonna get this molded today

16:43.305 --> 16:44.305
- when it's done.
- Okay.

16:48.043 --> 16:50.311
[Scraping metal effects]

16:50.346 --> 16:52.580
We have kind of bits
and pieces of an idea,

16:52.615 --> 16:54.616
but we don't have
a concept right now.

16:55.618 --> 16:57.752
This sound is really tough.

16:57.787 --> 16:59.687
It just sounds like breathing.

16:59.722 --> 17:03.358
[Breathing and scraping effects]

17:03.392 --> 17:04.759
We just start adding clay
on there,

17:04.794 --> 17:08.730
and hoping maybe a concept
will appear to us

17:08.763 --> 17:09.964
as we're sculpting.

17:09.999 --> 17:12.867
- Do you a back story in mind?
- I don't.

17:17.439 --> 17:18.906
- How are you?
- Good to meet you, man.

17:18.941 --> 17:20.842
We're Team Rayce.
That's why I called you over.

17:20.876 --> 17:22.377
- Hey, guys, how are you?
- Rob, how are you?

17:22.411 --> 17:24.412
I am so excited to be back
this season,

17:24.445 --> 17:25.946
- coaching Team Rayce.
- As you can see,

17:25.981 --> 17:29.651
- I've started on a face on...
- That's a big head.

17:29.685 --> 17:31.052
These two guys are planning
to build

17:31.086 --> 17:32.720
a creature suit
from head to toe.

17:32.755 --> 17:33.855
[Growling effects]

17:33.889 --> 17:35.790
The sound really works
with this design,

17:35.825 --> 17:38.593
and I'm gonna make sure that Rob
and Logan get things done today,

17:38.627 --> 17:40.628
because that clock
is always ticking.

17:40.663 --> 17:41.830
You got to move.

17:43.132 --> 17:44.532
Is he a warrior?
Where... you know,

17:44.567 --> 17:46.801
what period does he come from,
like, time frame?

17:46.836 --> 17:49.470
Laura and I see they are
struggling with their concept.

17:49.505 --> 17:50.905
Is he a good guy
or is he a bad guy?

17:50.940 --> 17:52.040
- Frankenstein character...
- Yeah.

17:52.074 --> 17:53.608
- Orc character...
- Is he science fiction?

17:53.642 --> 17:54.943
- Grotesque character?
- Is he horror?

17:54.977 --> 17:56.578
What genre is he?

17:56.612 --> 17:58.646
There aren't a lot of answers.
There's a lot of blank stares.

17:58.681 --> 18:00.381
Take a few minutes and
figure it out a little bit more.

18:00.416 --> 18:01.749
Maybe draw a few more pictures.

18:05.387 --> 18:06.654
So I'm sculpting the chest piece

18:06.689 --> 18:08.756
with all the different faces,
and Darla is working

18:08.791 --> 18:10.925
on the facial sculpt,
and I realize

18:10.960 --> 18:13.995
we have all of the models'
silicone life casts.

18:14.029 --> 18:16.397
So I grab white clay,
and I press it in,

18:16.432 --> 18:18.833
take the imprint
of the models' faces,

18:18.868 --> 18:20.401
and then slap it right on
and have

18:20.436 --> 18:21.970
a form that I can just
work with.

18:22.004 --> 18:25.740
Actually use a chest,
so that you can see the lines.

18:25.774 --> 18:27.242
You don't want edge problems.

18:29.745 --> 18:31.779
That's really clever.
It looks really good too.

18:31.814 --> 18:32.814
Thank you.

18:34.516 --> 18:36.718
I hear gears.
I hear heavy breathing,

18:36.752 --> 18:39.807
and I hear a knife
or some kind of blade at the end.

18:39.808 --> 18:42.990
After two long miserable hours,

18:42.995 --> 18:46.531
we finally come
to some sort of concept.

18:46.565 --> 18:48.700
It sounds like something's
coming towards me.

18:48.734 --> 18:50.335
At the last second,
when I finally see it,

18:50.369 --> 18:52.470
- that's when he... "ching."
- Yeah.

18:52.504 --> 18:55.440
Our concept is
a demon executioner

18:55.474 --> 18:59.177
that wears the faces
of people that he kills.

18:59.211 --> 19:00.278
I'm a little nervous.

19:00.312 --> 19:01.613
It seems like
the only other people

19:01.647 --> 19:04.148
that haven't gotten started yet
are Adam and Regina.

19:06.285 --> 19:11.389
I'm thinking, like,
almost, like, organic-ness.

19:11.424 --> 19:12.590
Like, bio-organic

19:12.625 --> 19:14.292
- is the style?
- No, no, no, no, no, hold on.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.561
Adam wants to go robotic.

19:16.595 --> 19:19.164
That takes
a lot more fabrication,

19:19.198 --> 19:22.867
which is not
one of my strong points.

19:24.036 --> 19:26.004
I have to do
a really good job at this,

19:26.038 --> 19:28.206
because Adam has immunity.

19:28.240 --> 19:32.143
I'm freaking out
because we're lost.

19:36.874 --> 19:39.809
It's the first day
of our sound design challenge,

19:39.844 --> 19:42.245
and the entire room has
at least one sculpture,

19:42.280 --> 19:45.315
but Adam and I
don't have anything.

19:45.349 --> 19:47.484
I'm just getting frustrated
at this point.

19:47.518 --> 19:49.252
They're kind of lost,
so I'm gonna go over

19:49.287 --> 19:50.320
and hang out with them.

19:50.354 --> 19:51.821
I really like the face.

19:51.856 --> 19:53.290
So after sketching
back and forth,

19:53.324 --> 19:55.192
I'm thinking robot,
but Regina has

19:55.226 --> 19:58.228
this idea
of this alien super soldier.

19:58.262 --> 20:00.063
[Distorted voice]
Activated.

20:00.097 --> 20:02.399
I want to stick
to Regina's design

20:02.433 --> 20:03.500
'cause I do have immunity.

20:03.534 --> 20:05.268
You got to get
some clay in your hand.

20:05.303 --> 20:07.337
If I don't see some clay
on this face,

20:07.371 --> 20:09.339
I'm gon' bust some humps.

20:09.373 --> 20:10.540
We got to get something
on that positive now.

20:10.575 --> 20:11.875
You got... You grabbed it
for a reason.

20:21.519 --> 20:22.986
Time's up, everybody.

20:23.020 --> 20:27.023
Adam and I are really behind
for such a big concept,

20:27.058 --> 20:29.726
but it's definitely
something different

20:29.760 --> 20:31.428
than anybody else is doing
in the room.

20:43.107 --> 20:45.675
It's day two in the lab.
We got 9 1/2 hours.

20:45.710 --> 20:49.379
We're gonna make the doll
look like she's withering away.

20:49.413 --> 20:51.748
I'm trying to think of where
I want to put the cracks on her.

20:51.782 --> 20:53.883
She's gonna have cracks,
but underneath all of that,

20:53.918 --> 20:55.885
she's still
perfect and pristine.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.054
To unify these pieces,
to get hers a little more

20:58.089 --> 21:02.359
like yours, or make yours have
a little bit more going on.

21:02.393 --> 21:03.526
Okay.

21:03.561 --> 21:05.595
Our sound is so cool.

21:05.630 --> 21:07.364
I started fabricating the cowl.

21:07.398 --> 21:09.733
It needs to look
more bird-like,

21:09.767 --> 21:14.004
so I used latex and paper towels
to create a shell,

21:14.038 --> 21:16.473
and then put in all the quills.

21:16.507 --> 21:17.907
I'm getting very frustrated

21:17.942 --> 21:21.077
because the cowl is taking
a lot longer than I expected.

21:21.112 --> 21:22.479
[Sighs]

21:23.748 --> 21:26.182
I need to finish the chest,
and then fabricate

21:26.217 --> 21:30.020
arms, legs, and hands,
and somehow get it done today.

21:30.054 --> 21:31.054
I mean, is he wearing anything?

21:31.088 --> 21:33.089
No.
It's full fabrication.

21:33.124 --> 21:35.225
It looks like there's
a lot left to do on this,

21:35.259 --> 21:36.760
and I'm not seeing
all the pieces

21:36.794 --> 21:37.827
that I should be seeing.

21:37.862 --> 21:39.262
I'll get it done.

21:39.297 --> 21:42.332
I finish the sculpture
for the helmet,

21:42.366 --> 21:45.468
so RJ helps me
with the vacuform piece.

21:45.503 --> 21:46.903
Ooh, that's cool.

21:46.937 --> 21:48.538
All right, guys, good luck.

21:48.572 --> 21:49.539
- Uh.
- Got this.

21:49.573 --> 21:50.540
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

21:50.574 --> 21:51.741
Good luck, guys.

21:51.776 --> 21:54.744
Now I need to finish
the cowl and the face.

21:54.779 --> 21:56.813
- What's going on with him?
- I don't know.

21:56.847 --> 21:58.882
The clock's ticking,
and we're at the point where

21:58.916 --> 22:00.884
we won't have time
to mold everything,

22:00.918 --> 22:04.187
so I help Regina finish the face
so she can finish the cowl,

22:04.221 --> 22:06.623
and then, we finally get
into molding.

22:13.297 --> 22:14.831
I've never done
this amount of molding

22:14.865 --> 22:16.266
in this amount of time.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.667
That's time, everybody.

22:28.245 --> 22:30.680
Go, go, go, go, go.
[Laughs]

22:30.715 --> 22:32.148
It's application day.

22:32.183 --> 22:34.651
We've got four hours in the lab
and one our at last looks.

22:34.685 --> 22:36.152
Yeah, if you put reds
on first...

22:36.187 --> 22:37.487
- Mm-hmm.
- and then you dry brush

22:37.521 --> 22:38.588
the black over it, that'll be

22:38.622 --> 22:40.056
- a good transition.
- All right.

22:40.091 --> 22:41.725
Dude, this came out pretty nice.

22:44.528 --> 22:46.429
Oh, that's sweet.

22:46.464 --> 22:48.198
Kelly and I want to give
our character a prop,

22:48.232 --> 22:49.966
so I do a quick drawing

22:50.000 --> 22:51.735
of the husband
and our character.

22:51.769 --> 22:54.504
So we're gonna just take
some tea, stain it,

22:54.538 --> 22:56.639
and it looks
like an old photograph.

22:59.977 --> 23:02.011
I got another big cowl for you.

23:02.046 --> 23:04.948
And you're just, like, kind of
looking... like, looking down.

23:04.982 --> 23:08.051
We're not gonna put this on
you until we get to last looks.

23:08.085 --> 23:09.386
This is such a big costume,

23:09.420 --> 23:10.720
we don't want to make
the model uncomfortable.

23:10.755 --> 23:12.055
If you could put this on,

23:12.089 --> 23:13.990
'cause I just need
to size up some pieces.

23:14.024 --> 23:16.860
I have to basically
refit the whole suit itself

23:16.894 --> 23:18.561
to make sure it fits
our model perfectly,

23:18.596 --> 23:21.297
and then, Logan pre-paints
the face,

23:21.332 --> 23:22.532
so we have a lot on our plate

23:22.566 --> 23:24.000
and no room for error
on this one.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.110
We've got a lot to do.

23:34.145 --> 23:37.914
Adam still has to make
arm pieces.

23:37.948 --> 23:41.184
Since Adam's gonna be
fabricating these arms,

23:41.218 --> 23:42.919
I'm gonna be
the one that's applying,

23:42.953 --> 23:47.557
and I'm not sure if we're gonna
be able to get it all done.

23:53.831 --> 23:56.633
The most important thing
is getting those pieces down.

23:56.667 --> 23:59.702
Once I get the face down,
Anthony comes over

23:59.737 --> 24:03.973
and we sort of tag team
gluing down the chest piece.

24:04.008 --> 24:06.276
I think we do have
a really cool concept.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.111
I personally would love a win.

24:09.413 --> 24:12.382
So while I'm applying
the bald cap and the face,

24:12.416 --> 24:15.051
Stephanie is pre-painting
this cowl,

24:15.085 --> 24:17.420
and anything that's not smooth,

24:17.455 --> 24:19.122
we're gonna have to make
look like cracks.

24:21.225 --> 24:22.325
The back piece
and the front piece

24:22.359 --> 24:25.161
they haven't even put on yet.

24:25.196 --> 24:26.830
They need to motor
on this stuff.

24:26.864 --> 24:28.498
Are you almost good with that?

24:28.532 --> 24:31.501
Yeah, we're at 1:53.
I'm just letting you know.

24:31.535 --> 24:32.936
I'm wrapping up.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.737
One thing about <i>Face Off</i> is that

24:34.772 --> 24:37.273
you got to figure out
what shortcuts are gonna work

24:37.308 --> 24:39.442
so that you can get these things
done in time.

24:39.477 --> 24:42.312
Try and lay that one hard edge
right up against the other one,

24:42.346 --> 24:45.114
and then that way, you don't
have to hide two hard edges.

24:45.149 --> 24:46.115
- Do too much.
- You know what I mean?

24:46.150 --> 24:47.150
Yeah.

24:51.689 --> 24:53.056
Jamie's applying this face,

24:53.090 --> 24:54.757
and it's taking her
a little bit longer

24:54.792 --> 24:58.261
because we have to overlap
the face onto the cowl

24:58.295 --> 25:00.597
and then do
a full body paint job.

25:00.631 --> 25:04.167
We just have so much to do
still, so I'm nervous.

25:08.739 --> 25:10.039
It's 15 minutes, everybody.

25:18.349 --> 25:20.683
This is a huge risk
because we need to put

25:20.718 --> 25:23.453
everything on this model
in last looks.

25:23.487 --> 25:24.687
That's time, everybody.

25:24.722 --> 25:25.722
Whoo.

25:25.756 --> 25:26.923
Everything is at stake,

25:26.957 --> 25:28.358
because if anything goes wrong
at this point,

25:28.392 --> 25:30.927
it's gonna completely ruin
everything.

25:40.611 --> 25:42.979
It's last looks.
Kelly and I have one hour.

25:43.013 --> 25:46.048
We got to get her contacts in,
we got to do her beauty makeup,

25:46.083 --> 25:48.517
we have to gloss her down, and
then we have to dirty her up.

25:48.552 --> 25:49.552
Nice.

25:51.121 --> 25:52.688
We've still got to give down
the face.

25:52.723 --> 25:54.790
We have to stretch
the prosthetic a little bit

25:54.825 --> 25:56.192
in order to fit the cowl,

25:56.226 --> 25:58.828
and it's kind of pulling
on our model's eyes,

25:58.862 --> 26:00.062
so it's making me
a little worried.

26:04.868 --> 26:06.068
Luckily, he's 6'4,

26:06.103 --> 26:08.337
and the judges can't see
down into his mouth,

26:08.372 --> 26:10.673
but it's not gonna be
the top look.

26:10.707 --> 26:12.074
I'm gonna have to get
more give in there.

26:13.977 --> 26:15.578
Still got to paint
the helmet green.

26:15.612 --> 26:16.679
Yeah, just do it.

26:16.713 --> 26:18.314
This helmet that we have
has to match

26:18.348 --> 26:19.582
all the other armor,

26:19.616 --> 26:22.485
and I can't find
the color we need.

26:22.519 --> 26:24.020
I find something close,

26:24.054 --> 26:27.556
and I end up just spattering
color onto the helmet.

26:27.591 --> 26:28.624
Ten minutes.

26:33.830 --> 26:35.298
That's time, everybody.

26:37.167 --> 26:41.871
There's a lot of missteps
that happened during last looks.

26:41.905 --> 26:45.541
Now, I'm super nervous.

26:56.420 --> 26:59.588
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

26:59.623 --> 27:02.091
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight,

27:02.125 --> 27:04.393
but before we see
your creations,

27:04.428 --> 27:08.097
let's say hello to our
illustrious series judges.

27:08.131 --> 27:10.366
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

27:10.400 --> 27:11.834
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

27:11.868 --> 27:13.069
All: Good evening.

27:13.103 --> 27:15.938
Three-time Oscar-winning

27:15.973 --> 27:18.174

- Hey, Ve.

27:18.208 --> 27:20.042
And creature and concept
designer, Neville Page.

27:20.077 --> 27:21.544
- Hello.
- Hello.

27:21.578 --> 27:22.645
And welcome back, Rayce.

27:22.679 --> 27:23.980
Thank you.
It's good to be back.

27:24.014 --> 27:25.915
I'm excited to see
what they've come up with.

27:25.949 --> 27:27.450
Well, guess what?

27:27.484 --> 27:28.451
The wait's over.

27:28.485 --> 27:30.152
- Yes!
- Yeah.

27:30.187 --> 27:32.688
All right, guys, this week,
your spotlight challenge

27:32.723 --> 27:34.757
was to create a character
inspired

27:34.791 --> 27:37.059
by one of the unique sounds
created

27:37.094 --> 27:41.931
by Academy Award-nominated
sound designer Erik Aadahl.

27:41.965 --> 27:44.066
So let's take a look
at your creations.

28:05.055 --> 28:07.056
I feel like we really were able

28:07.090 --> 28:08.657
to capture the sound
in our makeup.

28:08.692 --> 28:11.127
I love it, and I'm proud of it.

28:28.812 --> 28:30.980
He's really bigger than life,
but I'm kind of worried.

28:31.014 --> 28:32.848
Did we do enough, makeup-wise?

28:32.883 --> 28:35.384
At this point,
it's either go big or go home.

28:35.385 --> 28:38.020
They made a full fucking suit?

28:38.021 --> 28:39.655
Mm-hmm.

scary and badass,

29:31.808 --> 29:33.542
and I'm so excited,

29:33.577 --> 29:36.579
and I think our execution
is near perfect.

30:01.071 --> 30:03.606
I'm really disappointed
with the paint job.

30:03.640 --> 30:07.443
It looks washed out
and kind of clownish.

30:07.477 --> 30:09.578
I'm really scared
that I'm gonna be going home.

[Clicking effects]

30:30.734 --> 30:32.134
Jamie and I are feeling
really good.

30:32.169 --> 30:33.435
It's an overall character,

30:33.470 --> 30:35.905
and I feel like it
really matches our sound.

30:41.044 --> 30:43.179
All right, judges, why
don't you take a closer look?

30:49.085 --> 30:51.720
You know, for having to do
so many heads,

30:51.755 --> 30:54.690
they're pretty well rendered
in terms of sculpture.

30:54.724 --> 30:56.759
I just don't understand
this jaw line,

30:56.793 --> 30:59.128
and the way that it comes
down into the chin.

31:01.698 --> 31:04.166
Wow, they did a lot on this guy.

31:04.201 --> 31:05.568
It's too bad though that...

31:09.539 --> 31:11.073
Turn all the way around for us.

31:15.845 --> 31:17.479
I'm really worried
about the back

31:17.514 --> 31:19.148
because a lot of that
didn't get done.

31:19.182 --> 31:20.983
It was just kind of thrown
together last minute.

31:21.017 --> 31:23.419
I'm just hoping
nothing's falling off.

31:23.453 --> 31:24.787
It's just a mess.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.827
Tell us who made your favorite
sound-inspired creation

31:31.861 --> 31:33.762
on Twitter, using #FaceOff.

31:36.518 --> 31:37.918
Yeah, that's a waste of time.

31:37.952 --> 31:39.286
It's just too much.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.522
I'm just hoping
that nothing's coming apart

31:41.556 --> 31:43.924
and they really like our idea.

31:43.958 --> 31:45.859
It's busy,
but it's still kind of cool.

31:45.894 --> 31:47.361
Thank you.

31:49.497 --> 31:51.565
Look at her earrings,
they're little screws.

31:51.599 --> 31:52.666
- Yeah.
- It's cute.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.101
Look at that beautiful profile.

31:54.135 --> 31:58.105
They did a great job retaining
the female facial form.

32:00.041 --> 32:03.377
Open as wide as you can and
just see what that mouth does.

32:03.411 --> 32:05.279
You know what?
That's not as bad as

32:05.313 --> 32:06.280
- what I feared.
- Yeah, I didn't think

32:06.314 --> 32:07.314
it was gonna move.

32:12.687 --> 32:14.154
There's just nothing
around his lips.

32:14.189 --> 32:15.389
It really doesn't blend.

32:15.423 --> 32:16.990
It's just the hole
for his mouth.

32:22.230 --> 32:23.797
Can you turn around, Megan?

32:23.832 --> 32:25.299
- Wow.
- Amazing.

Okay, the judges have
scored your creations,

The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week,

32:57.599 --> 32:58.732

would like to find out

32:58.766 --> 33:00.133
more about your work.

33:00.168 --> 33:02.603
Stephanie and Kelly,
if you'd please step up.

33:09.644 --> 33:13.146
Tell me how you used the sound
to inspire your design.

33:13.181 --> 33:14.681
There's a clockmaker
and his wife,

33:14.716 --> 33:16.350
and she ends up dying.

33:16.384 --> 33:18.886
He can't live without her,
so he makes a doll

33:18.920 --> 33:20.320
that looks just like his wife.

33:20.355 --> 33:22.189
You could not have done
a better job

33:22.223 --> 33:25.959
- of integrating the sound cue.
- [Laughing]

33:25.994 --> 33:29.363
And your story motivated
the decision, sculpturally,

33:29.397 --> 33:31.031
to put some of these cracks
and things,

33:31.065 --> 33:32.466
which created opportunity

33:32.500 --> 33:34.735
to put those nice brown,
eroded colors in,

33:34.769 --> 33:37.237
and that makes
all the difference in the world.

33:37.272 --> 33:38.872
Thank you.

33:38.907 --> 33:41.341
I think you both did
an amazing job, and of course,

33:41.376 --> 33:44.111
the little portrait of her
and her husband, adorable.

33:44.145 --> 33:45.412
Who drew that portrait?

33:45.446 --> 33:46.547
- That was me, yeah.
- You did?

33:46.581 --> 33:48.015
Good job.
[Laughs]

33:48.049 --> 33:49.016
Thank you.

33:49.050 --> 33:50.384
It's beautiful, graphically.

33:50.418 --> 33:52.386
Who sketched out
the overall idea?

33:52.420 --> 33:54.321
I came up with...
instead of doing

33:54.355 --> 33:56.823
a steampunky, grungy character,
I was like,

33:56.858 --> 33:59.560
"Well, why don't we make it look
like a '40s, '50s housewife?"

33:59.594 --> 34:02.396
It really is rendered
and sculpted quite well.

34:02.430 --> 34:03.897
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

34:03.932 --> 34:06.934
Kelly and Stephanie,
please step back.

34:06.968 --> 34:07.968
[Chuckles]

34:10.271 --> 34:11.838
- Yes.
- Good job.

34:11.873 --> 34:13.206
Adam and Regina.

34:18.846 --> 34:21.214
Please tell me how
your sound influenced

34:21.248 --> 34:22.683
the design of your character.

34:22.717 --> 34:25.018
We got a pretty direct
robotic sound,

34:25.053 --> 34:27.788
and there was an animalistic,
techno sound in it,

34:27.822 --> 34:30.257
so we went half organic,
half mechanical with it.

34:30.291 --> 34:32.559
And who is responsible
for what on this character?

34:32.594 --> 34:34.561
The idea came from Regina.

34:34.596 --> 34:36.897
I sculpted
the chest and the back.

34:36.931 --> 34:39.967
And I sculpted the cowl,
the face, and the dome.

34:40.001 --> 34:42.703
I don't feel that this is
a very successful makeup.

34:44.839 --> 34:48.175
The face sculpt underneath
is very, very rough.

34:48.208 --> 34:50.010
He almost looks like
an old man without teeth,

34:50.043 --> 34:52.379
and his mouth
sucked up on itself.

34:52.413 --> 34:55.014
The body pieces are a lot more
successful than the face,

34:55.049 --> 34:57.050
which is what your center
of attention should be.

34:57.085 --> 34:58.852
Okay.

34:58.886 --> 35:00.554
- The visor you sculpted...
- Mm-hmm.

35:00.588 --> 35:03.857
Is gorgeous,
but the face is an abomination,

35:03.891 --> 35:05.192
and I know you're better
than that.

35:06.861 --> 35:09.129
Adam and Regina,
please step back.

35:09.163 --> 35:11.098
Thanks, man.

35:16.270 --> 35:19.272
Julian and Ben, you're up.

35:23.878 --> 35:25.112
Tell us about your character

35:25.146 --> 35:27.014
and how the sound
influenced its design.

35:27.048 --> 35:30.283
The heavy breathing
really stood out as demonic,

35:30.318 --> 35:33.220
and so we went for a demon
that kills

35:33.254 --> 35:35.222
anything and everything,
and then rips their face off,

35:35.256 --> 35:36.690
and en wears it himself.

35:36.724 --> 35:38.392
Face off demon.

35:38.426 --> 35:41.028
I did the cowl,
and then Julian did the face.

35:41.062 --> 35:42.396
I think you hit it
out of the park.

35:43.965 --> 35:45.298
I think the sculpting
is done really well.

35:45.333 --> 35:47.401
The proportions
are done really well.

35:47.435 --> 35:49.903
I love the changes, graphically,

35:49.937 --> 35:52.873
from black to red
to the pale face.

35:52.907 --> 35:54.441
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:54.475 --> 35:57.344
Getting that nice,
light tone in the face

35:57.378 --> 35:59.279
and then fading
into the darker colors

35:59.313 --> 36:01.314
just presents
extraordinarily well.

36:01.349 --> 36:02.983
- Thank you.
- He's very scary,

36:03.017 --> 36:04.685
and I think you did
a great job this week.

36:04.719 --> 36:05.886
Thank you.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.355
Thank you, guys.
You can please step back.

36:08.389 --> 36:10.390
Thank you.

36:12.527 --> 36:15.028
Darla and Anthony,
please step forward.

36:20.835 --> 36:23.236
Tell me how your sound
inspired your design tonight.

36:23.271 --> 36:25.439
We noticed that it was
a very ghostly sound

36:25.473 --> 36:26.907
that had
a lot of different voices,

36:26.941 --> 36:28.608
so we created Satan's servant,

36:28.643 --> 36:31.545
who absorbs souls
and drags them down into Hell.

36:31.579 --> 36:35.549
I primarily sculpted the face,
and Anthony did the chest.

36:35.583 --> 36:37.751
It feels a bit directionless,
I'm afraid.

36:39.387 --> 36:40.987
The paint job... it feels like
you didn't leave yourself

36:41.022 --> 36:42.255
enough time to color it,

36:42.290 --> 36:45.425
and the dark tones
in the lower half of his face

36:45.460 --> 36:47.728
muddle his head into his chest.

36:47.762 --> 36:49.730
From here, it looks like
he as whiskers,

36:49.764 --> 36:51.932
and the facial structure

36:51.966 --> 36:55.235
is much too big for the size
of his face and his body.

36:56.571 --> 36:58.839
You're trying to animate
this chest

36:58.873 --> 37:01.641
in a way that doesn't work
as a practical makeup,

37:01.676 --> 37:04.711
so it feels silly as a result.

37:04.746 --> 37:05.879
All right, thank you very much.

37:05.913 --> 37:07.080
Please step back.

37:13.421 --> 37:14.888
All right,
I'd like to offer our coaches

37:14.922 --> 37:17.524
the opportunity to speak
on behalf of their team members

37:17.558 --> 37:19.426
before the judges
make their decisions.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.395
I feel like I need
to speak up for Darla.

37:22.430 --> 37:25.332
She has done amazing top looks,

37:25.366 --> 37:27.000
and I would love to see
more of her work,

37:27.034 --> 37:29.569
and I hope we get to.

37:29.604 --> 37:31.938
Regina, she's had
some really successful makeups

37:31.973 --> 37:33.273
up to this point, and I think

37:33.307 --> 37:34.708
the sculpture did get
away from you a little bit,

37:34.742 --> 37:35.976
but I know you can sculpt,

37:36.010 --> 37:38.278
so I think it was just
kind of a bad day.

37:38.312 --> 37:40.447
Something I thought was
really clever

37:40.481 --> 37:43.517
on Anthony's part was to take
the silicon face casts

37:43.551 --> 37:46.586
of the actors and press
the wet clay into their faces

37:46.621 --> 37:48.088
and use those
in the chest piece.

37:48.122 --> 37:49.356
Yeah.
Innovative thought,

37:49.390 --> 37:50.390
I think it's really important.

37:50.424 --> 37:52.092
All right, thank you, guys.

37:52.126 --> 37:53.527
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

37:53.561 --> 37:55.462
while the judges deliberate.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.667
Alright, judges, let's start

38:00.701 --> 38:02.636
with your favorite looks
tonight.

38:02.670 --> 38:04.404
How about Stephanie and Kelly?

38:04.438 --> 38:06.006
Oh, I love that makeup.

38:06.040 --> 38:08.542
Really nice touches, right down
to their little earrings.

38:08.576 --> 38:10.677
Stephanie drew
that family picture

38:10.711 --> 38:12.179
that she was carrying
around with her.

38:12.213 --> 38:14.381
That's a detail that you often
don't have time to do

38:14.415 --> 38:16.683
and have it actually look
as competent as it did.

38:16.717 --> 38:19.686
All right, should we talk
about Ben and Julian?

38:19.720 --> 38:22.823
I think it was so well executed.

38:22.857 --> 38:24.791
They made really great use
of the model as well.

38:24.826 --> 38:27.127
They didn't have to take
a whole, big, phony chest piece.

38:27.161 --> 38:29.296
They just sculpted it down
as far as they had to.

38:29.330 --> 38:31.264
I think this is the second
time we've also seen

38:31.299 --> 38:33.767
this idea of a face
going onto a cowl,

38:33.801 --> 38:35.802
and it's almost a separate
element within the design,

38:35.837 --> 38:37.971
which I like.
It's a quality makeup.

38:38.005 --> 38:39.606
All right,
let's move on to the makeups

38:39.640 --> 38:41.808
that didn't quite work
for you guys.

38:41.843 --> 38:43.043
Regina and Adam.

38:43.077 --> 38:45.278
I liked the cowl,
the chest, and the back,

38:45.313 --> 38:46.880
and the face was
horribly painted,

38:46.914 --> 38:48.348
and it was horribly sculpted.

38:48.382 --> 38:50.550
He went into this challenge
knowing that he had immunity,

38:50.585 --> 38:52.619
but the one thing that does work

38:52.653 --> 38:54.855
are the elements
that he contributed.

38:54.889 --> 38:57.090
She needed to make the decision

38:57.124 --> 38:59.326
of bailing on that makeup

38:59.360 --> 39:02.295
and showcasing what she did
a gorgeous job on,

39:02.330 --> 39:04.397
and that is this visor.

39:04.399 --> 39:06.733
All right, let's move on
to Anthony and Darla.

39:06.767 --> 39:10.770
What a confused concept.
That face was bad.

39:10.805 --> 39:13.106
There was no sense
of understanding of anatomy.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.741
Yeah, I don't know
what she was thinking of

39:14.775 --> 39:16.810
when she sculpted that brow,
because it really did look

39:16.844 --> 39:18.612
like big, giant, bushy eyebrows.

39:18.646 --> 39:21.848
The bottom of the face merges
into the top of the chest

39:21.883 --> 39:24.384
and it makes it worse,
not better.

39:24.418 --> 39:26.152
I'm want to give higher marks,
though, for Anthony

39:26.187 --> 39:28.355
in using clay presses

39:28.389 --> 39:30.357
- as the faces on the body.
- Yeah.

39:30.391 --> 39:31.691
And I'm glad RJ brought that up,

39:31.726 --> 39:34.194

a smart process.

is everything settled, then?

I got to this point.

42:45.549 --> 42:46.815
I really, really am.

42:46.850 --> 42:48.598
This is a great job, okay?

42:48.633 --> 42:51.438
I found my voice,
I found my heart,

42:52.129 --> 42:54.081
I found what I love to do,

42:54.977 --> 42:56.931
and I found myself again.
