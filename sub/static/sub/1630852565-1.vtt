ASHIA BELLO: [SINGING]
Addicted to you, can't you see?

11:19.137 --> 11:23.310
Caressing my body, body.

11:23.344 --> 11:27.379
You make me feel
naughty, naughty.

11:27.413 --> 11:33.793
And before I know, I'm
taking off my clothes.

11:33.827 --> 11:42.206
Oh, it's deja vu, the same every
time that I want to fantasize.

11:42.241 --> 11:46.448
I can't help but
have you on my mind.

LISA [VOICEOVER]:
In the beginning,

11:48.103 --> 11:53.275
I felt loved every moment,
but that part of our lives

11:53.310 --> 11:56.413
feels so long ago.

11:56.448 --> 11:58.862
He hasn't looked at me the
same since I lost the baby.

12:05.896 --> 12:08.034
Hey, are you OK?

12:08.068 --> 12:10.862
Yeah, I'm good.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.965
Well, is there something you
wanted to talk to me about?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.793
You seem distant.

12:14.827 --> 12:18.034
I mean, what you
want to talk about?

12:18.068 --> 12:19.965
I don't know.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.931
Maybe how was my day or my
meeting at social services.

12:23.965 --> 12:28.137
This whole adoption thing is
something I don't want to do.

12:28.172 --> 12:30.827
Derrick, you act like
we have a lot of choices.

12:30.862 --> 12:35.448
If it was my choice, my
baby would have my DNA.

12:35.482 --> 12:39.827
You don't think I
want the same thing?

12:39.862 --> 12:43.137
Every time I walk past
that room, my heart hurts.

12:43.172 --> 12:46.000
For six months, I
carried that baby.

12:46.034 --> 12:47.896
Six months!

12:47.931 --> 12:49.448
I know.

12:49.482 --> 12:51.275
Baby--

12:51.310 --> 12:55.000
I wanted to be
buried with him.

12:55.034 --> 12:56.793
I'm trying so hard
not to be depressed--

12:56.827 --> 12:58.000
Hey--

12:58.034 --> 13:00.172
[SOBBING] --but it's hard.

13:09.172 --> 13:12.034
Uh, sorry, Miss Dawn!

13:12.068 --> 13:12.517
It's all right!

13:15.344 --> 13:16.379
ALEX: Dawn?

13:18.655 --> 13:20.896
Dawn?

13:20.931 --> 13:23.000
Dawn!

13:23.034 --> 13:23.931
You OK?

13:23.965 --> 13:24.586
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.931
Hey, baby.

13:28.965 --> 13:30.034
Hey.

13:30.068 --> 13:31.172
How was your day?

13:31.206 --> 13:32.241
It was good.

13:32.275 --> 13:33.896
I had lunch with Mom and Mark.

13:33.931 --> 13:34.448
Good.

13:34.482 --> 13:36.034
And how was the spa?

13:36.068 --> 13:38.137
Oh, it was so bomb.

13:38.172 --> 13:39.965
Thank you so much for that.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.965
Of course.

13:42.000 --> 13:42.551
Anything for you.

13:42.586 --> 13:43.413
Aw.

13:46.620 --> 13:49.103
How's my little pumpkin doing?

13:49.137 --> 13:51.034
He's good.

13:51.068 --> 13:52.413
He's inside waiting for Mommy
to put him down for a nap.

13:52.448 --> 13:54.206
Of course, he's
waiting for Mommy.

13:54.241 --> 13:55.379
Let me go get my baby.

14:00.655 --> 14:04.482
Hey, I wanted to talk to
you about a couple things

14:04.517 --> 14:06.137
a little later when
you get a minute.

14:06.172 --> 14:07.000
OK.

14:13.137 --> 14:14.965
DAWN: What are you building?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.344
LENNOX: I make it.

14:16.379 --> 14:18.137
DAWN: Oh, you're
building your blocks?

14:18.172 --> 14:19.137
Look at that.

14:19.172 --> 14:20.413
So tall.

14:20.448 --> 14:21.586
LENNOX: Want to build, too?

14:21.620 --> 14:23.586
DAWN: Yeah, I want to build.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.206

MICHELLE [VOICEOVER]:
Hello, Dawn.

15:48.793 --> 15:51.172
I hope all is well
with you and the baby.

15:51.206 --> 15:54.034
I know you haven't responded
to any of my letters,

15:54.068 --> 15:56.034
but I really want to have
a relationship with him

15:56.068 --> 15:57.310
as his grandmother.

15:57.344 --> 16:01.758
I know every letter says the
same thing, but I'm innocent.

16:01.793 --> 16:04.241
I had nothing to do
with Cori's death.

16:04.275 --> 16:08.482
My appeal will be heard soon,
and the truth will set me free.

16:08.517 --> 16:09.689
I just ask--

16:14.586 --> 16:16.379
MICHELLE: Cori?

16:16.413 --> 16:17.586
Where are you?

16:21.241 --> 16:22.068
I got your text.

16:27.241 --> 16:28.827
Cori?

16:28.862 --> 16:29.689
Cori.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.137
Cori!

16:34.172 --> 16:37.034
Cori!

16:37.068 --> 16:37.827
Cori, wake up!

16:37.862 --> 16:38.689
Cori!

16:56.413 --> 16:58.344
[gasps] Oh, oh.

16:58.379 --> 17:01.413
You scared me.

17:01.448 --> 17:02.482
He's sound asleep.

17:05.413 --> 17:07.241
How was your day?

17:07.275 --> 17:08.413
ALEX: Good.

17:08.448 --> 17:10.241
Really good, actually.

17:10.275 --> 17:12.275
My meeting went well.

17:12.310 --> 17:13.448
Well, that's good.

17:13.482 --> 17:14.724
Yeah.

17:14.758 --> 17:16.586
That's what I wanted
to talk to you out.

17:16.620 --> 17:19.896
Check this out.

17:19.931 --> 17:20.551
You see that?

17:20.586 --> 17:22.310
That's a great investment.

17:22.344 --> 17:24.517
This allows me to have
all three of my businesses

17:24.551 --> 17:27.448
in one building.

17:27.482 --> 17:29.862
Well, which businesses?

17:29.896 --> 17:32.551
Well, we were
thinking the gym,

17:32.586 --> 17:34.862
the spa, and the cigar lounge.

17:34.896 --> 17:36.413
All three pretty risky though.

17:36.448 --> 17:37.896
No, no, no.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.724
See, this isn't risky because
it's a great location.

17:39.758 --> 17:41.413
It's a high traffic area.

17:41.448 --> 17:43.310
So what's the investment?

17:43.344 --> 17:46.103
A couple 100,000, but
definitely worth it.

17:46.137 --> 17:48.793
Trust me.

17:48.827 --> 17:50.379
Yeah, I don't know, babe.

17:50.413 --> 17:54.137
I 100% guarantee you'll
get all the capital back.

17:54.172 --> 18:01.310
[sighs] I mean, I really
don't have a couple $100,000.

18:01.344 --> 18:03.620
And even if I did, I
think we should put it

18:03.655 --> 18:06.655
toward Lennox's college fund.

18:06.689 --> 18:08.482
That's what Cori would want.

18:08.517 --> 18:11.827
Babe, Lennox is my son, too.

18:11.862 --> 18:12.931
And that's why I want
to get this building,

18:12.965 --> 18:15.482
so I can contribute to
his college fund as well.

18:15.517 --> 18:16.655
OK.

18:16.689 --> 18:20.379
Well, I mean,
what's the big rush?

18:20.413 --> 18:23.379
Look, I think that we should
just do some more research,

18:23.413 --> 18:26.862
and then we'll figure it out.

18:26.896 --> 18:29.275
This doesn't have
to be done tomorrow.

18:29.310 --> 18:30.758
I'm not saying it has
to be done tomorrow,

18:30.793 --> 18:32.379
but we both know
what it means when

18:32.413 --> 18:34.275
you say let's figure it out.

18:34.310 --> 18:35.448
We've been talking
about me starting

18:35.482 --> 18:37.275
my own business forever.

18:37.310 --> 18:40.517
I don't know why it's
such a problem now.

18:40.551 --> 18:43.206
Really?

18:43.241 --> 18:44.862
Babe, I never said
it was a big deal.

18:44.896 --> 18:47.379
I just said we'll
handle it later.

18:47.413 --> 18:50.172
Well, I don't want
to handle it later.

18:50.206 --> 18:51.551
I'm tired of waking
up every morning

18:51.586 --> 18:53.655
and going to work
for somebody else.

18:53.689 --> 18:55.689
And you being your own boss,
I figured you of all people

18:55.724 --> 18:56.586
would understand that.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.448
Yeah, and I do.

18:58.482 --> 19:00.896
I do understand that.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.931
And I want you to be
financially stable as well,

19:02.965 --> 19:06.620
but it's got to make sense.

19:11.275 --> 19:16.827
Look, when you and Cori asked
me to be your surrogate,

19:16.862 --> 19:19.344
I didn't know she
was going to die,

19:19.379 --> 19:21.689
and I damn sure didn't know
that I was going to be raising

19:21.724 --> 19:25.965
a child, but here we are.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.586
I'm his mother now, and
I have to be financially

19:29.620 --> 19:30.896
responsible for all of us.

19:34.310 --> 19:34.896

19:54.034 --> 19:55.413
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions

19:55.448 --> 19:56.413
about Michelle Raymond.

19:56.448 --> 19:57.310
Sure.

19:57.344 --> 19:58.379
Come on in.

19:58.413 --> 19:59.310
Absolutely.

19:59.344 --> 20:00.000
Thank you.

20:02.551 --> 20:04.413
So what's all this about?

20:04.448 --> 20:06.965
Well, her appeal
hearing is coming up soon,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.448
and I wanted to go over your
testimony just to refresh

20:09.482 --> 20:11.379
our knowledge of the case.

20:11.413 --> 20:11.931
ALEX: OK.

20:11.965 --> 20:13.655
Good morning, ma'am.

20:13.689 --> 20:16.655
How are you?

20:16.689 --> 20:18.000
I'm fine.

20:18.034 --> 20:21.241
So Mr. Morant, you
said in your testimony

20:21.275 --> 20:24.310
that you found Michelle Raymond
standing next to Cori's body.

20:24.344 --> 20:28.034
Can you pick it up from that
particular situation for me?

20:28.068 --> 20:28.965
Sure.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.517
Cori wasn't feeling
too well that day.

20:31.551 --> 20:35.724
I remember she texted me,
asking me if I could hurry home.

20:35.758 --> 20:38.758
I left work, drove
straight home.

20:38.793 --> 20:41.379
When I walked into the house,
I searched all over for her.

20:41.413 --> 20:44.793
I couldn't find which
room she was in.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.586
I walked into our
bedroom, and that's when

20:46.620 --> 20:48.379
I saw Michelle standing there.

20:48.413 --> 20:56.689
She was just hovering over Cori
with this look in her eyes,

20:56.724 --> 21:02.655
this sinister look of pure evil.

21:02.689 --> 21:04.689
[CRYING] And that's when I knew.

21:11.965 --> 21:17.655
So I started trying
to resuscitate her.

21:17.689 --> 21:19.000
And I just happened to look up.

21:19.034 --> 21:22.034
And I see Michelle trying
to hide these pills.

21:22.068 --> 21:25.068
So she was trying to
hide the pills, actually?

21:25.103 --> 21:26.068
ALEX: Yes, sir.

21:26.103 --> 21:27.620
Then when I confronted
her about the pills,

21:27.655 --> 21:29.517
that's when she attacked me.

21:29.551 --> 21:34.965
And I'll be honest with you, I
wanted to retaliate because I

21:35.000 --> 21:37.827
just couldn't figure
out how she could

21:37.862 --> 21:40.344
do this to her own daughter.

21:43.034 --> 21:46.379
Listen, I know this
is tough, but trust

21:46.413 --> 21:49.655
and believe we're going
to resolve this situation.

21:49.689 --> 21:51.482
Thank you for your time.

21:51.517 --> 21:52.724
Detective?

21:52.758 --> 21:54.000
Yes?

21:54.034 --> 21:56.379
I don't know how much
weight this carries,

21:56.413 --> 21:58.620
but Michelle does not
deserve to be a free woman.

21:58.655 --> 22:01.517
She worked at the pharmacy,
which means she had access

22:01.551 --> 22:03.896
to those pills, the same
pills that the police

22:03.931 --> 22:05.517
found at her house.

22:05.551 --> 22:09.551
So in my opinion, this
is an open and shut case.

22:09.586 --> 22:12.793
Well, if the facts are as you
stated, it sounds like it is.

22:12.827 --> 22:13.793
Thank you for your time.

22:13.827 --> 22:14.862
I won't bother you guys no more.

little slow right now.

Hey, look.

25:38.655 --> 25:39.586
You know I love you.

25:39.620 --> 25:41.103
I know.

25:41.137 --> 25:43.241
I just want what's
best for my daughter,

25:43.275 --> 25:45.896
and you've worked so hard
to get where you are.

25:45.931 --> 25:46.896
I just don't know if he--

25:46.931 --> 25:47.758
DERRICK: If he what?

25:47.793 --> 25:51.241
[ominous music]

25:53.896 --> 25:57.620
It's funny, right, Lisa?

25:57.655 --> 26:00.034
The people that fail
in relationships

26:00.068 --> 26:01.068
always have the most advice.

26:01.103 --> 26:02.931
Derrick, stop.

26:02.965 --> 26:04.689
It's true.

26:04.724 --> 26:06.034
Right, Angela?

26:06.068 --> 26:07.344
What are you trying to say?

26:07.379 --> 26:10.310
I'm saying it's obvious
your husband left you.

26:10.344 --> 26:11.482
Remember?

26:11.517 --> 26:13.862
Yet you're here trying to
give your daughter advice

26:13.896 --> 26:15.275
on what type of man she needs.

26:15.310 --> 26:16.965
I know she needs
someone better than you,

26:17.000 --> 26:18.689
someone with a better job.

26:18.724 --> 26:19.379
DERRICK: Job?

26:19.413 --> 26:20.793
Hmm.

26:20.827 --> 26:22.689
You work at a
pharmacy as a cashier.

26:22.724 --> 26:23.413
Stop.

26:23.448 --> 26:24.827
All right, can you just stop?

26:24.862 --> 26:26.068
This is every time now.

26:26.103 --> 26:30.103
This shit is draining, listening
to you argue all the time!

26:30.137 --> 26:32.137
And you wonder
why I'm depressed!

26:32.172 --> 26:33.172
This is why!

26:36.344 --> 26:37.172
Hmm.

26:40.172 --> 26:43.758
Stop worrying
about my household.

26:43.793 --> 26:45.034
I got this.

26:45.068 --> 26:46.689
Let me tell you something.

26:46.724 --> 26:51.137
As long as my daughter's
here paying all the bills,

26:51.172 --> 26:52.310
I'm going to worry.

27:00.931 --> 27:04.137
[sobs]

27:05.965 --> 27:08.896
I'm so tired of you letting
your mother disrespect me!

27:08.931 --> 27:11.862
[gasps] [pants]

27:12.793 --> 27:13.206
You OK?

27:17.068 --> 27:17.896
Yeah.

27:17.931 --> 27:19.137
Yeah.

27:19.172 --> 27:22.034
Why did you sleep out here?

27:22.068 --> 27:26.413
Well, I just couldn't sleep,
and I came down here to read.

27:26.448 --> 27:28.344
I--I-- I must have just
fell asleep down here.

27:37.137 --> 27:39.206
Yeah, OK.

27:42.793 --> 27:44.241
What time is it?

27:44.275 --> 27:45.758
It's time for Lennox
to go to daycare.

27:45.793 --> 27:47.000
Oh, shit.

27:47.034 --> 27:48.137
No worries.

27:48.172 --> 27:50.034
I already got him ready.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.448
[sighs]

27:52.482 --> 27:53.103
OK, babe.

27:53.137 --> 27:54.137
I'm sorry.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.206
I-- I'm sure I can change and--

27:56.241 --> 27:57.448
Yeah.
No, it's--

27:57.482 --> 27:58.275
- --and take him.
- It's fine.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.275
It's already done.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.827
You're positive?

28:02.862 --> 28:04.034
I'm positive.

28:04.068 --> 28:05.965
It's OK.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.137
[sighs]

28:07.172 --> 28:10.103
I'll just see you later, OK?

28:10.137 --> 28:11.103
Try to get yourself together.

28:11.137 --> 28:14.517
[soft music]

28:24.137 --> 28:25.206
Thank you.

28:31.379 --> 28:32.448
I found these on the floor.

28:38.068 --> 28:38.931
Wow.

28:38.965 --> 28:42.551
Um, I'm sorry.

28:42.586 --> 28:44.275
Babe, I-- I don't even
know how they got there.

28:52.137 --> 28:54.172
Hello?

28:54.206 --> 28:55.068
DAWN [ON PHONE]: Mom?

28:55.103 --> 28:55.931
Hey.

28:55.965 --> 28:57.103
What's going on?

28:57.137 --> 28:58.275
DAWN [ON PHONE]: [sighs]

28:59.241 --> 29:00.896
I'm not feeling too well.

29:00.931 --> 29:01.896
Really?

29:01.931 --> 29:03.448
What's wrong?

29:03.482 --> 29:04.482
DAWN [ON PHONE]: I don't know.

29:04.517 --> 29:08.551
I just-- I feel groggy and weak.

29:08.586 --> 29:09.448
Aw.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.344
Do you need anything?

29:11.379 --> 29:12.172
DAWN [ON PHONE]: No, Ma.

29:12.206 --> 29:13.862
I should be fine.

29:13.896 --> 29:16.034
Do you mind covering
for me today?

29:16.068 --> 29:17.448
Yeah, no problem.

29:17.482 --> 29:19.103
Are you sure you're OK?

29:19.137 --> 29:20.620
DAWN [ON PHONE]: Yeah.

29:20.655 --> 29:22.586
I think I'm just going
to relax for a bit.

29:22.620 --> 29:24.275
DAWN'S MOM [ON
PHONE]: OK, honey.

29:24.310 --> 29:26.620
Have some tea, and burn some
of those oils I gave you.

29:26.655 --> 29:29.482
Oh, that's what I
meant to tell you.

29:29.517 --> 29:31.206
You remember the woman
at the restaurant

29:31.241 --> 29:33.206
that bumped my chair?

29:33.241 --> 29:35.000
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: Yeah.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.275
Well, she took the wrong
bag, so she's probably enjoying

29:37.310 --> 29:38.517
those oils that you bought me.

29:38.551 --> 29:39.896
[laughs]

29:39.931 --> 29:40.862
Really?

29:40.896 --> 29:42.379
That sucks.

29:42.413 --> 29:45.551
Well, I actually
have her book.

29:45.586 --> 29:49.551
And it's good, but
weird at the same time.

29:49.586 --> 29:50.517
Hmm.

29:50.551 --> 29:53.965
Sounds interesting, I think.

29:54.000 --> 29:54.965
DAWN [ON PHONE]: Yeah.

29:55.000 --> 29:55.689
I don't know.

29:55.724 --> 29:57.482
It's just something about it.

29:57.517 --> 30:01.034
It's, um-- I don't know.

30:01.068 --> 30:02.413
Something familiar about it.

30:02.448 --> 30:04.206
But, um, I don't know.

30:04.241 --> 30:05.206
I'll call you back later, Ma.

30:05.241 --> 30:06.103
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: OK.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.103
Feel better, honey.

30:07.137 --> 30:08.034
OK, I will.
I love you.

30:08.068 --> 30:08.620
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: OK.

30:08.655 --> 30:09.482
Bye, bye.

30:12.931 --> 30:16.275

Let's make you beautiful.

30:26.379 --> 30:28.068
JAMIE: Put the offer together.

30:28.103 --> 30:29.000
It's a solid one.

30:33.448 --> 30:34.965
I don't have the check yet.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.344
[ominous music]

30:39.310 --> 30:41.517
What do you mean you
don't got the check yet?

30:44.034 --> 30:48.068
She got the money, but we're
just trying to figure it out.

30:48.103 --> 30:50.482
[sighs] [chuckles]

30:53.482 --> 30:57.034
You'll figure it out.

30:57.068 --> 30:59.172
To be all the way
honest, I ain't even

30:59.206 --> 31:01.275
trying to hear all that shit.

31:01.310 --> 31:04.206
If she's got the money, then
why you ain't got the check?

31:04.241 --> 31:05.379
Yo, just calm down, man.

31:05.413 --> 31:07.551
Look, I ain't
calming shit down.

31:07.586 --> 31:10.344
You must not understand
what's going on here,

31:10.379 --> 31:12.586
so let me refresh your memory.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.172
I know everything, Alex.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.965
This is not a partnership.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.206
You owe me.

31:18.241 --> 31:19.172
Yeah, I know.

31:19.206 --> 31:23.379
Just-- I'ma figure it out.

31:23.413 --> 31:25.586
Well, you got a couple days.

31:25.620 --> 31:28.689
And after that, I got
to do what I got to do.

31:28.724 --> 31:31.413
If I got to expose you,
believe me, I will.

31:55.137 --> 31:59.965
This is one of the things
that I struggle with on a daily.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.068
Some days, I think it
was the right thing

32:03.103 --> 32:06.344
to do because
Lennox is so happy,

32:06.379 --> 32:09.000
and I know no one would take
care of him the way I can.

32:14.206 --> 32:19.620
Other days, my sister,
I feel like I betrayed

32:19.655 --> 32:23.172
you because I know
that this is the life

32:23.206 --> 32:24.000
that you always wanted.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.586
[CRYING] Cori, I love you.

32:32.586 --> 32:36.413
And I-- I need you
to know that I never

32:36.448 --> 32:39.034
wanted to take your place.

32:39.068 --> 32:42.655
I never wanted to
be with your man.

32:42.689 --> 32:47.965
When you died, a
piece of me died.

32:52.034 --> 32:57.068
And being Lennox's adoptive
mother is the only piece of you

32:57.103 --> 32:58.620
that I have left.

32:58.655 --> 33:02.551
It's the only thing
that gives me life.

LISA [VOICEOVER]: If it
wasn't for my best friend,

33:34.517 --> 33:37.034
Oh, my goodness.

33:37.068 --> 33:39.689
I can not believe you're here.

33:39.724 --> 33:40.448
Aw.

33:40.482 --> 33:41.724
I--I finally came.
I'm sorry.

33:41.758 --> 33:42.724
Oh, wait.
I'm sorry.

33:42.758 --> 33:44.241
Wait.
My room is a mess.

33:44.275 --> 33:46.206
Oh, my goodness.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.137
Let me just--

33:47.172 --> 33:47.965
I can help you.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.068
I mean, it looks
like you need it.

33:50.103 --> 33:51.827
You know I would sleep with
you in a dumpster if I had to.

33:51.862 --> 33:52.517
Yeah.

33:52.551 --> 33:53.482
Well, this is pretty close.

33:53.517 --> 33:57.241
Um-- hey.

33:57.275 --> 33:59.724
So how's my sis?

33:59.758 --> 34:02.275
Girl, I don't even
recognize myself anymore, OK?

34:02.310 --> 34:03.655
Look at me.

34:03.689 --> 34:05.241

you've been through?

34:05.275 --> 34:07.448
Your energy and your
soul is glowing.

34:07.482 --> 34:08.448
Enough about me.

34:08.482 --> 34:09.620
What's going on with you?

34:09.655 --> 34:11.655
Um, nothing much.

34:11.689 --> 34:14.103
Well, today, I was at
the lawyer's office,

34:14.137 --> 34:16.103
going over the details
of my trust fund.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.758
I thought you
did that already.

34:17.793 --> 34:20.551

structured it so that money

34:20.586 --> 34:21.827
would be released over time.

34:21.862 --> 34:23.482
And then every time
money is released,

34:23.517 --> 34:25.310
I have to go sign for it.

34:25.344 --> 34:26.379
Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

34:26.413 --> 34:27.344
That's boring.

I want juicy.

34:28.448 --> 34:29.586
Come on.

34:29.620 --> 34:32.482
Tell me what's
going on with Larry.

34:34.517 --> 34:35.379

34:35.413 --> 34:36.655
You know I love Larry.

34:36.689 --> 34:37.379
KELLY: You're going
to be disappointed.

34:37.413 --> 34:39.551

34:39.586 --> 34:40.862
Because there's no more Larry.

34:42.827 --> 34:44.241
No.

I know you liked him.

34:46.241 --> 34:47.620
LISA: Yeah.

34:47.655 --> 34:49.551
I just couldn't do it anymore.

34:49.586 --> 34:51.689
Yeah, his name is Steven.

34:51.724 --> 34:53.172
I think you'll like
him more than Larry.

34:53.206 --> 34:56.103
LISA: More?

34:56.137 --> 34:56.551
KELLY: Well--

34:56.586 --> 34:57.620
LISA: I'll try.

35:18.827 --> 35:21.586
We just can't do all for
the bullshit, you know?

35:21.620 --> 35:25.275
Girl, don't I know.

35:25.310 --> 35:26.551
Is everything OK?

35:26.586 --> 35:29.620
[sighs] It's not the same.

35:29.655 --> 35:32.965
And honestly, I'm not the same.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.862
I'm sorry I haven't been
here every single day.

35:35.896 --> 35:37.586
I would not
forgive myself if you

35:37.620 --> 35:40.827
were here every single day, OK?

35:40.862 --> 35:44.310
You have a life and a business.

35:44.344 --> 35:46.310
I understand.

35:46.344 --> 35:52.275
I know, but I should have
been here more than I have.

35:52.310 --> 35:54.206
You're here now.

35:54.241 --> 35:55.689
That I am.

35:55.724 --> 35:56.931
I have good news though.

35:56.965 --> 35:58.379
What?

35:58.413 --> 36:00.241
I met someone else.

36:00.275 --> 36:00.758
That was fast.

36:22.551 --> 36:23.896
Oh, my-- you scared me.

36:23.931 --> 36:27.413
What are you doing
sitting in the dark?

36:27.448 --> 36:29.724
Thinking.

36:29.758 --> 36:32.413
You're thinking in the dark?

36:32.448 --> 36:33.206
[SIGHING] OK.

36:37.758 --> 36:39.275
How you doing?

36:39.310 --> 36:39.862
I'm all right.

36:39.896 --> 36:41.448
I'm just tired.

I don't know what's
going on with my body.

I just feel weak.

You need to eat.

36:50.034 --> 36:52.034
I can make you something.

36:52.068 --> 36:52.689
All right.

36:52.724 --> 36:53.931
Thank you.

go to the bathroom.

Being blinded by love

what was happening

Thanks, babe.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.482
Oh, this is good.

37:48.517 --> 37:49.310
You want a bite?

37:49.344 --> 37:50.344
Nah.

37:50.379 --> 37:50.931
I'm good.

37:50.965 --> 37:52.034
I'm not hungry.

37:52.068 --> 37:52.931
You OK?

38:03.931 --> 38:06.000
When did you decide
to get a policy?

38:06.034 --> 38:08.655
I mean, when I lost
the baby, and I heard

38:08.689 --> 38:10.724
the doctor say I
could have died,

38:10.758 --> 38:13.758
I got a life insurance policy.

38:13.793 --> 38:15.482
You should get one, too.

38:15.517 --> 38:17.068
I will.

38:17.103 --> 38:19.793
I might have you as the
beneficiary, unlike yours.

38:19.827 --> 38:21.413
It's not even like that.

38:21.448 --> 38:24.137
Then how is it?

38:24.172 --> 38:25.896
We both know your
mother would love

38:25.931 --> 38:30.034
a couple 100,000 if something
happened to you and Kelly.

38:30.068 --> 38:31.758
Her family's got money.

38:31.793 --> 38:33.655
She don't even need it.

38:33.689 --> 38:35.655
And then there's me.

38:35.689 --> 38:37.137
I'm left out in the cold.

38:37.172 --> 38:37.965
[scoffs]

38:44.137 --> 38:46.758
But anyway, I had a
couple of thoughts

38:46.793 --> 38:50.517
about this whole
adopting a baby thing.

38:50.551 --> 38:52.862
OK.

38:52.896 --> 38:54.896
Have you thought
of a surrogate?

38:54.931 --> 38:56.620
Nah, it's too expensive.

38:56.655 --> 38:58.034
Yeah.

38:58.068 --> 39:00.827
But what if it wasn't expensive?

39:00.862 --> 39:05.620
Like what if I can
get it for free?

39:05.655 --> 39:07.172
How, Derrick?

39:07.206 --> 39:08.068
Kelly.

39:08.103 --> 39:09.206
What?

39:09.241 --> 39:10.620
Think about it.

39:10.655 --> 39:12.103
She's like a sister.

39:12.137 --> 39:14.827
You know she'll do
anything for you.

39:14.862 --> 39:16.034
You put her as a
second beneficiary

39:16.068 --> 39:18.551
on your life insurance policy.

39:18.586 --> 39:20.793
That says a lot.

39:20.827 --> 39:22.793
She's the perfect candidate.

39:22.827 --> 39:24.482
No.

39:24.517 --> 39:26.172
I would feel crazy asking her
to do something like that.

39:26.206 --> 39:27.448
Uhn-uhn.

39:27.482 --> 39:28.103
I--

39:30.655 --> 39:33.206
You think she likes
seeing you like this?

39:33.241 --> 39:36.482
Do you think she enjoys
knowing you're depressed?

39:41.862 --> 39:45.827
This is the best
thing for you and us.

39:45.862 --> 39:48.206
The least you can do is try!

39:48.241 --> 39:48.862
OK.
OK.

39:48.896 --> 39:49.689
Right?

39:49.724 --> 39:50.586
OK.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.965
All right, OK.

39:54.000 --> 39:54.965
Let me just--

40:18.206 --> 40:20.172
Uh, Lisa?

40:20.206 --> 40:22.172
Oh, my god.

40:22.206 --> 40:23.965
Hey.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.655
Girl, I almost hit you.

40:25.689 --> 40:28.206
Oh, I'm sorry for popping
up on you like this.

40:28.241 --> 40:29.172
No, it's OK.

40:29.206 --> 40:30.551
I was just going to
go run some errands.

40:30.586 --> 40:31.172
Are you OK?

40:31.206 --> 40:32.655
Yeah.

40:32.689 --> 40:34.551
Um, can we just take
a walk for a minute?

40:34.586 --> 40:37.862
Sure, sure.

40:37.896 --> 40:38.896
LISA: You look cute.

40:38.931 --> 40:39.724
KELLY: Thank you.

40:39.758 --> 40:42.000
You look good, too.

40:42.034 --> 40:44.689
You know I know when
you're lying, right?

40:44.724 --> 40:46.655
So what's going on?

40:46.689 --> 40:47.620
Talk to me.

40:47.655 --> 40:49.482
I don't know.

40:49.517 --> 40:51.517
It's like, I don't know
what's going on with Derrick.

40:51.551 --> 40:54.620
One minute, he's trying to get
me to join this pyramid scheme,

40:54.655 --> 40:57.206
and then the next he's
having these crazy thoughts

40:57.241 --> 40:58.724
about adopting.

40:58.758 --> 41:01.206
Really?

41:01.241 --> 41:05.275
But then last night, we
talked about a surrogate.

41:05.310 --> 41:08.034
KELLY: Hmm.

41:08.068 --> 41:10.724
I mean, a surrogate
is a good option.

41:10.758 --> 41:15.000
Yeah, but he mentioned you.

41:15.034 --> 41:15.862
KELLY: Me?

41:15.896 --> 41:17.137
LISA: I know.

41:17.172 --> 41:19.034
I looked exactly how
you do right now, right?

41:19.068 --> 41:20.241
I'm like, that's crazy, right?

41:20.275 --> 41:21.103
But--

41:21.137 --> 41:22.793
Mm.

41:22.827 --> 41:24.172
--I don't know.

41:24.206 --> 41:26.137
It's like, the more I
sat and thought about it,

41:26.172 --> 41:28.137
the less crazy it
kind of sounded.

41:30.758 --> 41:33.793
I mean, look, you've been
my sister since day one.

41:33.827 --> 41:35.793
I have always considered
you as that, right?

41:35.827 --> 41:38.172
And I don't know.

41:38.206 --> 41:40.137
When I think about
somebody to share

41:40.172 --> 41:44.724
such a precious,
life-changing moment with,

41:44.758 --> 41:46.965
you're the only person
that I could think of.

41:50.586 --> 41:54.896
You know, when the doctor
said that they had to decide

41:54.931 --> 41:56.655
between saving me or my baby--

42:01.689 --> 42:03.724
[sobs]

42:03.758 --> 42:04.310
--I was ready to die.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.965
Knowing that I can't have
children, it just, like--

42:11.000 --> 42:12.172
it just, like, killed my soul.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.758
And I know--

42:18.793 --> 42:22.034
I know that I cannot fathom,
you know, what I'm asking you.

42:22.068 --> 42:22.931
Like, I get it,
'cause it's a lot.

42:22.965 --> 42:25.310
Sis, sis, sis.

42:25.344 --> 42:26.000
Stop.

42:26.034 --> 42:28.758
Stop.

42:28.793 --> 42:29.206
I'll do it.

42:32.655 --> 42:34.586
I'll do it.

42:34.620 --> 42:38.758
I can't even imagine the type
of pain you have endured.

42:38.793 --> 42:40.034
You are so strong.

42:40.068 --> 42:43.034
You know that?

42:43.068 --> 42:44.620
And I know if the
roles were reversed,

42:44.655 --> 42:46.793
and I was sitting
on this bench asking

42:46.827 --> 42:49.758
you to do the same thing,
you would do it for me.

42:49.793 --> 42:50.655
Of course.

42:50.689 --> 42:51.655
I know.

42:51.689 --> 42:52.793
I know.

42:52.827 --> 42:53.620
It's going to be OK.

42:53.655 --> 42:55.862
I love you.

42:55.896 --> 42:57.620
It's going to be OK.

42:57.655 --> 42:59.275
LISA [VOICEOVER]:
Best friend, you're

42:59.310 --> 43:03.000
the light to my darkness,
the strength to my weakness,

43:03.034 --> 43:05.000
the peanut butter to my jelly.

43:09.448 --> 43:10.068
CORI: Ay.

43:10.103 --> 43:11.758
I'm rolling my ace today.

43:11.793 --> 43:12.379
Ay, y'all.

43:12.413 --> 43:13.310
What's up?

43:13.344 --> 43:14.862
We're two peas in a pod.

43:14.896 --> 43:15.931
DAWN [VOICEOVER]: That's right.

43:15.965 --> 43:16.931
And I'm the peanut butter.

43:16.965 --> 43:18.344
CORI: And I'm the jelly.

43:18.379 --> 43:20.413
[BOTH] And you can't
have one without the other.

43:20.448 --> 43:22.137
[laughter]

43:23.448 --> 43:25.275
Oh, shit.

43:25.310 --> 43:27.862
You scared the hell out of me.

43:27.896 --> 43:30.689
What are you doing?

43:30.724 --> 43:32.000
I'm wondering why
you haven't picked

43:32.034 --> 43:34.827
up our son like you agree to.

43:34.862 --> 43:35.655
Shit.

43:35.689 --> 43:36.689
I'm sorry.

43:36.724 --> 43:37.379
I forgot.

43:37.413 --> 43:39.758
Yeah.

43:39.793 --> 43:42.758
I see why.

43:42.793 --> 43:43.965
I'll go get him.

43:44.000 --> 43:44.793
I'll come with you.

43:44.827 --> 43:45.344
It's fine.

43:45.379 --> 43:47.862
Can I have my book?

43:47.896 --> 43:49.931
Maybe you should
give this book a break.

43:49.965 --> 43:51.310
You're becoming obsessed.

43:51.344 --> 43:52.793
What?

43:52.827 --> 43:54.241
I'm fine.

43:54.275 --> 43:56.000
And you don't have to
take it away from me

43:56.034 --> 43:58.000
like a toy from a child.

43:58.034 --> 44:00.206
Can you stop, please?

44:00.241 --> 44:03.310
Will you look at yourself?

44:03.344 --> 44:07.172
You're acting like this
over a little book.

44:07.206 --> 44:08.862
You haven't worked.

44:08.896 --> 44:09.827
You haven't cooked.

44:09.862 --> 44:10.896
You ain't even cleaned
up the damn place.

44:10.931 --> 44:12.724
Excuse you.

44:12.758 --> 44:13.275
Give me my book.

44:17.896 --> 44:19.862
I don't know what's
going on with you,

44:19.896 --> 44:23.827
Dawn, but this little obsession
that you have with this book?

44:23.862 --> 44:24.275
It ain't healthy.

44:33.206 --> 44:34.827
JAMIE [ON PHONE]:
You got my money?

44:34.862 --> 44:36.379
Almost.

44:36.413 --> 44:38.034
JAMIE [ON PHONE]: So
why are you on my phone?

44:38.068 --> 44:40.241
I need more pills.

44:40.275 --> 44:41.448
JAMIE [ON PHONE]: These
games you playing,

44:41.482 --> 44:42.896
I don't got time for them.

44:42.931 --> 44:45.896
I'm not playing
any games, all right?

44:45.931 --> 44:47.448
You said you want
the money, right?

44:47.482 --> 44:48.862
Yeah.

44:48.896 --> 44:52.758
Well, I need more
pills, like ASAP.

44:52.793 --> 44:55.344
JAMIE [ON PHONE]: Meet me
at the spot, and hurry up.

44:55.379 --> 44:58.034
Yeah.

Ma?

45:03.241 --> 45:04.103
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: Hey.

45:04.137 --> 45:07.103
How are you feeling?

45:07.137 --> 45:09.000
I'm losing my shit.

45:09.034 --> 45:10.034
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: What?

45:10.068 --> 45:12.551
What's wrong with you?

45:12.586 --> 45:14.965
You remember that book
that I've been reading?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.551
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: Mm,
the weird and good one?

45:17.586 --> 45:18.379
Yeah.

45:18.413 --> 45:20.103
It's-- I don't know.

45:20.137 --> 45:21.551
It's weird.

45:21.586 --> 45:24.413
It--It's like it's-- it's
connected to me somehow.

45:24.448 --> 45:27.103
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]:
[LAUGHING] What?

45:27.137 --> 45:29.448
I'm serious, Ma.

45:29.482 --> 45:33.413
It's like everything that
I'm reading in the book

45:33.448 --> 45:35.551
is happening in my real life.

45:35.586 --> 45:39.206
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]:
[laughs] Dawn, baby,

45:39.241 --> 45:40.793
have you been
getting enough rest?

45:40.827 --> 45:41.310
Yes.

45:41.344 --> 45:42.827
All I do is sleep.

45:42.862 --> 45:46.034
And no, I'm not overreacting,
so don't say that.

45:46.068 --> 45:47.793
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: OK, OK.

45:47.827 --> 45:50.034
Calm down.

45:50.068 --> 45:52.551
Well, I don't know.

45:52.586 --> 45:54.931
Maybe you need to get out
of the house for a while.

45:54.965 --> 45:56.413
Come here.

45:56.448 --> 45:58.310
The customers have been
asking about you anyway.

46:03.586 --> 46:04.448
Yeah.

46:07.206 --> 46:08.137
Um, I don't kn--

46:08.172 --> 46:09.206
Mom, let me call you back.

Hey.

You busy?

46:42.000 --> 46:46.103
Uh, just returning
some emails.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.275
All right.

46:47.310 --> 46:51.103
Um, I owe you an apology.

46:51.137 --> 46:53.068
I was being an asshole
earlier because I--

46:53.103 --> 46:54.206
I really miss you.

46:56.551 --> 46:59.034
I feel like you've been
a little distant lately,

46:59.068 --> 47:00.965
but that's no excuse.

47:01.000 --> 47:01.413
I'm sorry.

47:04.206 --> 47:07.137
Aw.

47:12.310 --> 47:14.620
I've, um-- I don't know.

47:14.655 --> 47:19.241
I just-- I've just been trying
to figure everything out.

47:19.275 --> 47:25.068
And I'm sorry, too.

47:25.103 --> 47:27.517
It's all good.

47:27.551 --> 47:30.103
I brought us back a
nice bottle of wine,

47:30.137 --> 47:32.172
and I dropped Lennox off
at your mother's house

47:32.206 --> 47:36.689
because I figured we
needed some adult time.

47:36.724 --> 47:38.206
OK.

47:38.241 --> 47:39.586
Yeah?

47:39.620 --> 47:40.379
Yeah.

47:40.413 --> 47:41.448
All right.

47:53.517 --> 47:57.034
He is so precious.

47:57.068 --> 47:58.137
He is.

47:58.172 --> 48:02.620
He is just like Cori.

48:02.655 --> 48:04.517
Her twin, literally.

I know at times you might
question all of this

Cori loved you and me.

heart, I believe she

48:41.551 --> 48:44.137
would have been OK
with this, especially

48:44.172 --> 48:46.103
for the sake of Lennox.

If I didn't believe that, I
wouldn't be here with you.

49:15.344 --> 49:16.482
It's my mom.

49:16.517 --> 49:18.241
She texted me.

49:18.275 --> 49:23.344
I forgot about this client
picking up this painting.

49:23.379 --> 49:24.655
She can't handle that?

49:24.689 --> 49:29.137
Um, it's one of my
father's old friends.

He likes to sit and talk, and he
spends a lot of money with us.

49:33.758 --> 49:36.724

sit and listen.

No, it's fine.

letters I've written to you,

1:04:56.413 --> 1:04:58.172
I love Cori.

1:04:58.206 --> 1:05:01.758
I would have never done anything
to hurt my one and only child.

1:05:01.793 --> 1:05:04.241
I think in your
heart you know that.

1:05:04.275 --> 1:05:06.068
He is very dangerous.

1:05:10.172 --> 1:05:11.172
Oh.

1:05:11.206 --> 1:05:13.034
ALEX: Here he is.

1:05:13.068 --> 1:05:14.137
There's my boy.

1:05:14.172 --> 1:05:16.137
LENNOX: Daddy.

1:05:16.172 --> 1:05:18.448
[sighs] All right.

1:05:18.482 --> 1:05:20.103
It's time for school.

1:05:20.137 --> 1:05:21.620
No, no, no.

1:05:21.655 --> 1:05:23.310
I think we're going
to skip school today.

1:05:23.344 --> 1:05:24.448
He can stay home with me.

1:05:27.034 --> 1:05:28.620
Why?

1:05:28.655 --> 1:05:30.448
Because I miss him, and
I want to spend some time

1:05:30.482 --> 1:05:33.413
with my son and my wife.

1:05:36.379 --> 1:05:38.655
Uh, I--I just have a few
errands that I need to run,

1:05:38.689 --> 1:05:39.103
so--

1:05:39.137 --> 1:05:41.310
ALEX: Really?

1:05:41.344 --> 1:05:42.241
Yeah.

1:05:42.275 --> 1:05:44.413
What kind of errands?

1:05:44.448 --> 1:05:45.689
A doctor's appointment.

1:05:45.724 --> 1:05:46.551
For?

1:05:50.517 --> 1:05:52.482
Female stuff.

1:05:52.517 --> 1:05:54.034
Just a checkup.

1:05:54.068 --> 1:05:57.965
Yeah, a doctor's
appointment for a checkup.

1:06:01.758 --> 1:06:02.586
OK.

1:06:05.862 --> 1:06:07.206
OK.

1:06:07.241 --> 1:06:08.034
All right, baby.

1:06:08.068 --> 1:06:09.344
Mommy loves you.

1:06:09.379 --> 1:06:12.310
See you later.

1:06:12.344 --> 1:06:14.655
Hey?

1:06:14.689 --> 1:06:15.689
We'll be here waiting for you.

1:06:31.482 --> 1:06:35.103
[phone ringing]

1:06:35.137 --> 1:06:36.482
OFFICER JOLLY [ON PHONE]:
Women's Detention Center.

1:06:36.517 --> 1:06:37.724
Officer Jolly speaking.
- Hi.

1:06:37.758 --> 1:06:38.931
Yeah.

1:06:38.965 --> 1:06:41.724
Um, I wanted to know how I
could visit an inmate there.

1:06:41.758 --> 1:06:43.206
What's the inmate's name?

1:06:43.241 --> 1:06:44.827
Michelle Raymond.

1:06:44.862 --> 1:06:46.482
OFFICER JOLLY [ON PHONE]:
And what is your name?

1:06:46.517 --> 1:06:49.068
I'm Dawn Goldie.

1:06:49.103 --> 1:06:50.620
OFFICER JOLLY [ON PHONE]:
Yeah, I'm sorry, ma'am.

1:06:50.655 --> 1:06:51.724
You're not on the visiting list.

1:06:51.758 --> 1:06:53.241
So she has to put
you on the list,

1:06:53.275 --> 1:06:55.034
and it has to be approved.

1:06:55.068 --> 1:06:56.379
OK.

1:06:56.413 --> 1:06:58.103
H--How long does
that usually take?

1:06:58.137 --> 1:06:59.413
OFFICER JOLLY [ON PHONE]: Uh,
that-- that can take weeks.

1:06:59.448 --> 1:07:03.620
Look, sir, um, if there's
any way that you could

1:07:03.655 --> 1:07:04.758
just make something
happen for me,

1:07:04.793 --> 1:07:06.793
it's-- it's-- it's an emergency.

1:07:06.827 --> 1:07:08.310
OFFICER JOLLY [ON
PHONE]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

1:07:08.344 --> 1:07:09.103
This is protocol, ma'am.

1:07:21.172 --> 1:07:22.344
ALEX: I hope I
get time for that.

1:07:22.379 --> 1:07:23.275
You feel me?

1:07:23.310 --> 1:07:24.379
MARK: Oh, my god.

1:07:24.413 --> 1:07:25.379
Do you remember that?

1:07:25.413 --> 1:07:26.310
ALEX: It was just like that.

1:07:26.344 --> 1:07:29.103
MARK: That was hilarious.

1:07:29.137 --> 1:07:29.793
Surprise.

1:07:33.448 --> 1:07:35.655
Well, hello to you, too.

1:07:35.689 --> 1:07:37.172
I didn't know we
were having company.

1:07:37.206 --> 1:07:38.275
Yeah.

1:07:38.310 --> 1:07:39.551
I invited them over.

1:07:39.586 --> 1:07:42.310
You know, it's been a while
since we all sat down together.

1:07:42.344 --> 1:07:43.724
Figured why not, right?

1:07:43.758 --> 1:07:47.413
And look, we brought your
favorite bottle of wine.

1:07:47.448 --> 1:07:48.517
DAWN'S MOM: We did.

1:07:48.551 --> 1:07:50.448
Great.

1:07:50.482 --> 1:07:53.206
Uh, I'll go freshen up.

1:08:05.448 --> 1:08:07.172
[knocking]

1:08:07.206 --> 1:08:08.517
Yes?

1:08:08.551 --> 1:08:09.931
DAWN'S MOM: It's me, honey.

1:08:09.965 --> 1:08:11.310
Are you OK?

1:08:11.344 --> 1:08:12.931
Yeah.

1:08:12.965 --> 1:08:16.965
I just didn't know we were
having a family dinner.

1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.206
I mean, I would like to
know those kinds of things.

1:08:20.241 --> 1:08:22.206
Is it a big deal?

1:08:22.241 --> 1:08:25.379
Stop being a grouch, and
come eat with your family.

1:08:25.413 --> 1:08:29.689
Alex prepared this nice dinner
and has cooked for everyone.

1:08:29.724 --> 1:08:32.310
Be grateful that you
have a good husband.

1:08:50.551 --> 1:08:51.931
I made your favorite.

1:08:59.344 --> 1:09:01.758
[doorbell ringing]

1:09:06.758 --> 1:09:07.862
Hi.
JAMIE: Hello.

1:09:07.896 --> 1:09:08.896
How are you?
- Come on in.

1:09:08.931 --> 1:09:10.275
Thank you very much.

1:09:10.310 --> 1:09:10.793
Good.

1:09:10.827 --> 1:09:11.758
Is-- Is Alex here?

1:09:11.793 --> 1:09:13.241
- And what's your name?
- Jamie.

1:09:13.275 --> 1:09:14.137
Jamie.

1:09:14.172 --> 1:09:15.034
Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

1:09:15.068 --> 1:09:16.275
OK.
Alex!

1:09:16.310 --> 1:09:16.724
Let me get this.

1:09:16.758 --> 1:09:18.758
Oh, excuse me.

1:09:18.793 --> 1:09:20.275
- Beautiful home.
- Thank you so much.

1:09:20.310 --> 1:09:20.758
Yeah, of course.

1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:26.931
What are you doing here?

1:09:26.965 --> 1:09:28.758
I tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

1:09:28.793 --> 1:09:30.620
It's kind of funny
you just went MIA,

1:09:30.655 --> 1:09:33.413
so I figured I'd come by and
see what's going on with you.

1:09:33.448 --> 1:09:34.862
All right.

1:09:34.896 --> 1:09:36.448
Well, can we talk
about this later?

1:09:36.482 --> 1:09:38.551
DAWN'S MOM: Alex, is your
friend staying for dinner?

1:09:38.586 --> 1:09:40.413
- Oh--
- No.

1:09:40.448 --> 1:09:41.896
--I definitely wouldn't
want to intrude, but I'm very

1:09:41.931 --> 1:09:43.827
hungry, so thank you very much.

1:09:43.862 --> 1:09:44.931
DAWN'S MOM: Come on in.

1:09:44.965 --> 1:09:46.275
JAMIE: Plus, it smells amazing.

1:09:50.965 --> 1:09:54.241
It's been a while since
I've had a home-cooked meal.

1:09:54.275 --> 1:09:56.862
Mm.

1:09:56.896 --> 1:10:00.275
I must say, it's very good.

1:10:00.310 --> 1:10:04.000
So Dawn, I hear
you're a painter.

1:10:04.034 --> 1:10:05.103
Yeah.

1:10:05.137 --> 1:10:08.275
DAWN'S MOM: Dawn's father
was a famous painter.

1:10:08.310 --> 1:10:09.793
That's where she
gets her talent from.

1:10:09.827 --> 1:10:11.448
Oh, you should come
check out the gallery.

1:10:11.482 --> 1:10:12.448
Oh, amazing.

1:10:12.482 --> 1:10:13.448
I would love to.

1:10:13.482 --> 1:10:14.758
I'm very fascinated by art.

1:10:14.793 --> 1:10:16.000
DAWN'S MOM: So what do you do?

1:10:16.034 --> 1:10:18.241
JAMIE: I'm an investment broker.

1:10:18.275 --> 1:10:20.413
I started a gym on the
West Side Alex works at.

1:10:20.448 --> 1:10:21.103
DAWN'S MOM: Oh, OK.

1:10:21.137 --> 1:10:22.413
So is that how you guys met?

1:10:22.448 --> 1:10:23.724
JAMIE: Oh, no.

1:10:23.758 --> 1:10:25.379
We went to college together.

1:10:25.413 --> 1:10:27.034
Oh, the good old days.

1:10:27.068 --> 1:10:29.344
College was some of the
best times of my life.

1:10:29.379 --> 1:10:30.517
Tell me about it.

1:10:30.551 --> 1:10:32.034
I think it's those drugs.

1:10:32.068 --> 1:10:33.862
I don't remember my freshman
year, my sophomore years.

1:10:33.896 --> 1:10:35.551
Oh, spare me the details.

1:10:35.586 --> 1:10:36.551
MARK: Trust me, it was wild.

1:10:36.586 --> 1:10:37.586
[laughs]

1:10:37.620 --> 1:10:39.379
JAMIE: It's funny you say that.

1:10:39.413 --> 1:10:42.724
Me and Alex were the same exact
way, always laughing and joking

1:10:42.758 --> 1:10:45.034
about our drinking alter egos.

1:10:45.068 --> 1:10:48.931
I was Justin, and what was it?

1:10:48.965 --> 1:10:49.482
Derrick.

1:10:49.517 --> 1:10:50.758
Yeah, that's right.

1:10:50.793 --> 1:10:51.793
You were Derrick.

1:10:54.379 --> 1:10:56.689
What did you say?

1:10:56.724 --> 1:10:58.344
His drinking alter ego name.

1:10:58.379 --> 1:11:00.586
It was Derrick.

1:11:00.620 --> 1:11:01.448
Yeah.

1:11:01.482 --> 1:11:04.689
[ominous music]

1:11:05.827 --> 1:11:07.344
[clears throat]
Please excuse me.

1:11:12.448 --> 1:11:15.413
Is everything all
right with your lady?

1:11:15.448 --> 1:11:16.965
Yeah.

1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.620
She, uh-- she ain't been
feeling too good lately.

1:11:19.655 --> 1:11:20.655
Oh.

1:11:20.689 --> 1:11:21.793
That's too bad.

1:11:32.517 --> 1:11:33.931
[knocking]

1:11:33.965 --> 1:11:35.517
Honey, are you OK in there?

1:11:35.551 --> 1:11:36.586
DAWN: Uh, yeah.

1:11:36.620 --> 1:11:38.068
Um, just give me a few minutes.

1:11:38.103 --> 1:11:38.620
DAWN'S MOM: OK.

1:11:38.655 --> 1:11:39.758
Just call me later.

1:11:39.793 --> 1:11:41.000
We're getting ready to head out.

1:11:41.034 --> 1:11:41.862
OK.

1:11:47.551 --> 1:11:51.827
Well, I hate to eat and run,
but I got a very important

1:11:51.862 --> 1:11:53.689
meeting I got to head to.

1:11:53.724 --> 1:11:54.827
Thank you so much for having me.

1:11:54.862 --> 1:11:55.827
DAWN'S MOM: Oh, no problem.

1:12:03.965 --> 1:12:08.000
Don't make these
little drop-bys a habit.

1:12:08.034 --> 1:12:10.034
That's a nice little
family you got in there.

1:12:10.068 --> 1:12:14.586
Listen, I'ma be
ready real soon, aight?

1:12:14.620 --> 1:12:16.034
It's not soon enough.

1:12:16.068 --> 1:12:19.379
You better hurry up and
do whatever it takes.

1:12:19.413 --> 1:12:21.482
Or?

1:12:21.517 --> 1:12:23.413
They're all going to be
really interested in who

1:12:23.448 --> 1:12:25.034
Derrick really is.

1:12:25.068 --> 1:12:26.586
I told you, I'ma handle it.

1:12:26.620 --> 1:12:27.931
[scoffs] Yeah, you better.

1:12:31.689 --> 1:12:32.896

1:13:50.517 --> 1:13:52.689
Holy shit.

1:13:52.724 --> 1:13:53.931
Holy shit.

1:13:55.827 --> 1:13:56.827
Jackpot.

LISA [VOICEOVER]: That part of
our lives feels so long ago.

1:14:20.310 --> 1:14:22.827
Managing my mother
and my relationship

1:14:22.862 --> 1:14:24.655
is wearing me down.

1:14:24.689 --> 1:14:28.724
If it wasn't for my best friend,
I don't know where I would be.

1:14:28.758 --> 1:14:33.034
Betrayal is worst when it
comes from someone you love.

1:14:33.068 --> 1:14:36.000
I never thought my life would
have this sharp of a turn.

- Hey.

1:15:59.793 --> 1:16:00.310
DAWN'S MOM: Hey.

1:16:03.965 --> 1:16:05.103
[sighs]

1:16:05.137 --> 1:16:06.689
Thank you for coming
to watch Lennox.

1:16:06.724 --> 1:16:07.275
Yeah.

1:16:07.310 --> 1:16:08.379
Have you heard from her?

1:16:08.413 --> 1:16:09.413
Nah.

1:16:09.448 --> 1:16:10.517
DAWN'S MOM: Oh.

1:16:10.551 --> 1:16:12.896
I called her a few times,
but she ain't answer.

1:16:12.931 --> 1:16:15.689
What?

1:16:15.724 --> 1:16:17.758
All right, so he's
upstairs playing.

1:16:17.793 --> 1:16:19.827
I already fed him and bathed
him, so he should be good.

1:16:19.862 --> 1:16:20.724
DAWN'S MOM: OK.

1:16:20.758 --> 1:16:22.172
If you hear from
her, can you text me?

1:16:22.206 --> 1:16:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No problem.

1:16:23.034 --> 1:16:24.310
All right.
I shouldn't be too long.

1:16:24.344 --> 1:16:25.931
DAWN'S MOM: Mm.
- Thank you again.

1:16:25.965 --> 1:16:26.758
DAWN'S MOM: Yeah.

1:16:26.793 --> 1:16:29.862
[ominous music]

1:16:29.896 --> 1:16:31.275
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]:
Dawn, where are you?

1:16:31.310 --> 1:16:32.379
Just driving.
Why?

1:16:32.413 --> 1:16:33.413
What's up?

1:16:33.448 --> 1:16:34.965
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]:
Honey, you know how much

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:36.931
I love and respect you, right?

1:16:36.965 --> 1:16:38.689
OK?

1:16:38.724 --> 1:16:41.068
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: I need
you to tell me the truth.

1:16:41.103 --> 1:16:42.965
Tell you the truth?

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.758
The truth about what, Mom?

1:16:44.793 --> 1:16:47.068
DAWN'S MOM [ON
PHONE]: Your drug use.

1:16:47.103 --> 1:16:48.689
My what?

1:16:48.724 --> 1:16:50.034
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: Dawn,
let's do this together.

1:16:50.068 --> 1:16:51.931
Ma, what are
you talking about?

1:16:51.965 --> 1:16:52.965
Who told you this?

1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:54.758
[sighs]

1:16:54.793 --> 1:16:56.000
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]: With the
way you've been acting lately,

1:16:56.034 --> 1:16:58.413
we're both really worried.

1:16:58.448 --> 1:17:00.413
We?

1:17:00.448 --> 1:17:03.137
DAWN'S MOM [ON PHONE]:
Dawn, Alex found your pills.

[car horn honking]

1:17:23.482 --> 1:17:24.965
LISA [VOICEOVER]: I
know you're wondering

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.344
why I never came to you.

1:17:27.379 --> 1:17:29.275
I'm too embarrassed to say but--

1:17:29.310 --> 1:17:31.482
CORI [VOICEOVER]: But I will.

1:17:31.517 --> 1:17:35.724
The truth is I was jealous
that he wanted you and not me--

1:17:35.758 --> 1:17:38.379
the twinkle in his eyes
when he looked at you, how

1:17:38.413 --> 1:17:40.206
joyful he looked when
he rubbed your stomach.

1:17:43.034 --> 1:17:46.241
I even made myself believe
that you enjoyed it, too.

1:17:46.275 --> 1:17:48.068
I was so focused on
what my mind created

1:17:48.103 --> 1:17:52.103
that I didn't even pay attention
to what actually was happening.

1:17:52.137 --> 1:17:54.793
And now it's too late.

1:17:54.827 --> 1:17:59.931
So as I write this to you, I
want you to know I apologize.

1:17:59.965 --> 1:18:03.965
I apologize for being jealous,
I apologize for being insecure,

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.137
and I apologize for
not being the sister

1:18:07.172 --> 1:18:09.482
that you expected me to be.

1:18:09.517 --> 1:18:11.448
So if these are the
last words to you,

1:18:11.482 --> 1:18:15.034
just know you will
be proud of me.

1:18:15.068 --> 1:18:17.551
I won't go without a fight.

1:18:17.586 --> 1:18:18.965
We're sisters.

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.103
We're best friends.

1:18:21.137 --> 1:18:22.965
We're connected to the end.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:27.965
That special day in the bathroom
is where our journey began.

1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.551
Hi.

1:18:50.586 --> 1:18:53.793
Are you OK?

1:18:53.827 --> 1:18:55.000
No.

1:18:55.034 --> 1:18:56.965
I think I just got my period.

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.068
YOUNG DAWN: Me too.

1:18:58.103 --> 1:19:01.034
Do you have a pad?

1:19:01.068 --> 1:19:03.034
YOUNG CORI: No.

1:19:03.068 --> 1:19:03.517
YOUNG DAWN: Here.

1:19:07.965 --> 1:19:08.586
Thank you.

1:19:12.655 --> 1:19:14.310
Are you OK?

1:19:14.344 --> 1:19:16.068
Yeah, I'm OK.

1:19:16.103 --> 1:19:17.241
I'm Dawn.

[eerie music]

1:20:17.137 --> 1:20:18.344
Hi.

1:20:18.379 --> 1:20:19.172
May I help you with something?

1:20:19.206 --> 1:20:22.068
Um, is the owner
of the store here?

1:20:22.103 --> 1:20:23.172
You're looking at her.

1:20:23.206 --> 1:20:24.413
Oh, OK.

1:20:24.448 --> 1:20:26.586
Um, I have a question
about a book.

1:20:26.620 --> 1:20:27.241
Sure.

1:20:27.275 --> 1:20:29.517
Which one?

1:20:29.551 --> 1:20:33.586
I think it was published
here or maybe sold here.

1:20:33.620 --> 1:20:34.448
Yes.

1:20:34.482 --> 1:20:36.034
We are a local
publishing company.

1:20:36.068 --> 1:20:38.517
We try to publish the
books of local writers

1:20:38.551 --> 1:20:40.413
to help them build a fan
base through our bookstore.

1:20:40.448 --> 1:20:42.896
She did such an amazing
job with this one

1:20:42.931 --> 1:20:45.172
that we decided to
publish it for her.

1:20:45.206 --> 1:20:46.620
Have you read it?

1:20:46.655 --> 1:20:52.344
Yeah, but the author isn't
Caitlin Charles though.

1:20:52.379 --> 1:20:54.000
So you're the best friend?

1:20:56.620 --> 1:20:58.103
Yeah, I am.

1:20:58.137 --> 1:21:01.103
I've been waiting for
you for some time now.

1:21:01.137 --> 1:21:03.655
She described you perfectly.

1:21:06.586 --> 1:21:07.655
Cori?

1:21:07.689 --> 1:21:09.517
Yes.

1:21:09.551 --> 1:21:11.931
So here I have
something for you.

1:21:11.965 --> 1:21:12.655
OK.

1:21:18.379 --> 1:21:22.103
Here is the
original manuscript

1:21:22.137 --> 1:21:23.310
written by Cori Raymond.

1:21:23.344 --> 1:21:25.551
She only wanted you to have it.

1:21:31.448 --> 1:21:33.655
It's a tragedy what
happened to her.

1:21:33.689 --> 1:21:36.482
But before she
passed, she mentioned

1:21:36.517 --> 1:21:38.586
there might be
more to the story,

1:21:38.620 --> 1:21:40.689
but only you would
know where to find it.

1:21:40.724 --> 1:21:42.448
Do you have any
idea what she meant?

1:22:02.172 --> 1:22:03.448
CORI AND LISA [VOICEOVER]:
We're sisters.

1:22:03.482 --> 1:22:04.655
We're best friends.

1:22:04.689 --> 1:22:06.413
We're connected to the end.

1:23:23.172 --> 1:23:27.034
If you're watching this
video, I'm probably dead.

1:23:27.068 --> 1:23:28.724
The phone you have is
connected to this camera,

1:23:28.758 --> 1:23:33.379
and you will see
everything he's done to me.

1:23:33.413 --> 1:23:36.724
He's been tracking my every
move, but he didn't get this.

1:23:36.758 --> 1:23:38.517
So if I end up missing,
I know you know

1:23:38.551 --> 1:23:40.137
what to do with this, Dawn.

1:23:40.172 --> 1:23:41.551
I love you so much.

1:23:44.241 --> 1:23:45.241
Yeah, I'm here.

1:23:45.275 --> 1:23:45.724
Come to the house.

1:23:54.172 --> 1:23:55.344
What are you doing?

1:23:55.379 --> 1:23:56.206
Get out!

1:23:56.241 --> 1:23:57.793
Whoa.

1:23:57.827 --> 1:24:00.517
Just tell me what's
wrong with you.

1:24:00.551 --> 1:24:03.620
What's wrong with me?

1:24:03.655 --> 1:24:05.793
Maybe it's the drugs
you've been giving me.

1:24:05.827 --> 1:24:09.275
What are you talking about?

1:24:09.310 --> 1:24:10.448

1:24:10.482 --> 1:24:11.275
Hey, easy.

1:24:11.310 --> 1:24:12.103
Get out.

1:24:12.137 --> 1:24:12.827
OK, relax.

1:24:12.862 --> 1:24:13.724
OK?

1:24:13.758 --> 1:24:15.620
Just put the knife down.

1:24:15.655 --> 1:24:16.724
You really thought
you was going

1:24:16.758 --> 1:24:18.586
to get away with this, huh?

1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:20.586
You think you so
smart, but you not.

1:24:24.827 --> 1:24:25.310
OK.

1:24:25.344 --> 1:24:27.620
Listen, all right?

1:24:27.655 --> 1:24:29.310
I don't know what
you think you saw,

1:24:29.344 --> 1:24:31.206
but I promise you, that's
not what's going on.

1:24:31.241 --> 1:24:32.206
I got everything.

1:24:32.241 --> 1:24:33.310

You're going to prison!

to yourself for a minute.

You know how much I love you.

1:24:44.896 --> 1:24:46.103
OK, easy.

1:24:46.137 --> 1:24:47.275
Get out.

1:24:47.310 --> 1:24:49.896
I will kill you.

1:24:49.931 --> 1:24:52.517
Get out.

All right.

enough for me.

I thought I had it
all figured out,

but what I didn't

that, uh, you never loved me,
and you couldn't even fake it.

you could have done.

Oh, how could I forget this?

This is a letter confessing your
obsession that you had with me,

1:31:54.655 --> 1:32:00.206
and that obsession
led to your addiction.

1:32:00.241 --> 1:32:01.862
Yeah.

1:32:01.896 --> 1:32:04.896

only way you could explain

her baby, which ultimately

1:32:10.241 --> 1:32:14.034

Oh, you-- you want
to say something?

1:32:26.655 --> 1:32:27.068
What'd you say?

1:32:29.689 --> 1:32:30.310
You're sick.

1:32:33.034 --> 1:32:34.620
You're right.

1:32:44.275 --> 1:32:46.896
You didn't have to kill her.

1:32:46.931 --> 1:32:49.068
You could have just left.

1:32:49.103 --> 1:32:52.586
I could have just left?

1:32:52.620 --> 1:32:57.068
And passed up on all of this,
including the $2 million

1:32:57.103 --> 1:33:00.137

you got for my baby?

1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:15.000
Yes.

All of this is [MOCKINGLY

I could have just
gave you the money.

1:33:24.310 --> 1:33:28.137
Oh, now you could have
just given me the money?

1:33:28.172 --> 1:33:29.689
It's too late for all that.
