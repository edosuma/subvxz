Oh, baby,
I know you lost a tooth.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.134
Don't worry.
The tooth fairy took it

20:37.136 --> 20:38.536
and brought you
that quarter.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.738
The tooth fairy?
Who's that?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.990
Well, Rallo, he's a fairy
who comes into your room

20:42.992 --> 20:45.926
while you're sleeping,
takes your tooth, leaves money.

20:45.928 --> 20:49.112
And what is in it
for this gentleman?

20:49.114 --> 20:50.764
I guess he likes baby teeth.

20:50.766 --> 20:54.635
Whoa, I reckon it don't get
any weirder than that.
