<i>A vehicle can have</i>
<i>a happy face, or a mask.</i>

<i>It has to impart a soul.</i>

<i>Why am I looking at this car?</i>
<i>It's looking back at me.</i>

01:02.687 --> 01:04.064
<i>It stirs something in me.</i>

<i>It projects my personality so perfectly."</i>

01:14.991 --> 01:16.701
<i>That connection with the vehicle,</i>

02:34.279 --> 02:35.530
<i>Everything should be art.</i>

02:36.865 --> 02:39.909
<i>It's not just designing for Chrysler.</i>
<i>We're designing for car designers, right?</i>

02:39.993 --> 02:41.786
<i>So we should up each other's game.</i>

02:43.997 --> 02:46.166
It should look good.
It should sit on the road

02:46.249 --> 02:50.920
and represent not only the brand well,
but be an attractive craft from Detroit.

[upbeat piano music playing]

03:03.266 --> 03:05.643
[Boudette]<i> Ralph got a job as a designer,</i>

03:11.900 --> 03:15.194
I don't know of anybody, ever,
younger than Ralph

03:15.278 --> 03:16.696
who's been Head of Global Design.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.912
[Ralph] <i>Chrysler is a very, very scrappy,</i>
<i>innovative company.</i>

03:23.995 --> 03:27.540
<i>It's always been the third largest,</i>
<i>you know, in the US auto industry.</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:29.417
<i>And that's okay.</i>

03:30.209 --> 03:32.921
<i>It's always had to innovate its way</i>
<i>to be noticed.</i>

03:33.004 --> 03:34.214
[whirring]

03:39.969 --> 03:41.930
<i>It takes a lot of work</i>
<i>to maintain a brand.</i>

03:42.013 --> 03:45.183
<i>A lot of brands have died</i>
<i>in the last six years because of that.</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:50.271
<i>The Chrysler brand</i>
<i>is better than it gets credit for.</i>

03:51.231 --> 03:54.776
<i>Every brand, I don't care who it is,</i>
<i>has had a dodgy product in their past</i>

03:54.859 --> 03:57.070
<i>that has sullied the brand</i>
<i>a little bit, unfortunately.</i>

03:57.153 --> 03:59.822
<i>But I'm a romantic that way. I believe</i>
<i>you can design your way out.</i>

03:59.906 --> 04:02.825
<i>You can create a product</i>
<i>that reinvigorates, revitalizes the brand,</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:04.577
<i>and that's through engineering and design.</i>

04:06.955 --> 04:09.707
<i>Right now, we're designing</i>
<i>the concept car, the SM-1.</i>

04:11.209 --> 04:15.255
<i>It's a family vehicle that's</i>
<i>fully electric and autonomous capable.</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:19.008
-[Ralph] Wow! It's really different.
-[colleague] Yeah.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.928
We really tried to play
with giving the car more stance,

04:22.011 --> 04:24.722
make it feel slender and more Airstream.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.057
It has an athletic...

04:26.140 --> 04:29.227
Even though it's not meant to be
a sports car, it has an athletic stance.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.397
I think that's what creates
a unique proportion as well, you know?

04:32.480 --> 04:35.733
[Ralph] Do you think the horizon line
will actually behave that way?

04:36.317 --> 04:40.196
Do you intend the line to be that crisp,
or are you gonna soften it off a little?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.825
Are you counting on paint to do this,
or are you gonna make a crisp line?

04:43.908 --> 04:44.867
Crisp line.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.036
I think the initial idea
was to soften it up,

04:47.120 --> 04:49.205
-not so soft that there's not a break...
-Yeah.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.709
but soft enough that, you know,
all of these radiuses kind of...

04:52.792 --> 04:55.169
-You mind if I put a piece of tape on it?
-Yeah, go for it.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.630
See if it kind of holds
all the way around the car.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.756
[colleague] Test it out.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.717
[colleague clears throat]

05:01.759 --> 05:05.138
[Ralph]<i> Most designs have a theme line</i>
<i>that holds the design together.</i>

05:05.221 --> 05:06.806
<i>The tape is one of those lines.</i>

05:08.391 --> 05:09.976
<i>If you don't get the bones right,</i>

05:10.059 --> 05:12.937
<i>you're never gonna have a good design,</i>
<i>no matter how hard you try.</i>

05:13.021 --> 05:14.856
<i>I remember in school,</i>
<i>times we talked about,</i>

05:14.939 --> 05:17.191
<i>"Can you sketch this car in three lines?"</i>
<i>You know?</i>

05:17.942 --> 05:21.070
<i>"Is it distinctive enough to capture it?"</i>
<i>And I think you could.</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:24.449
I hate to break it to you,
I'm not feeling the wheels.

05:24.532 --> 05:25.533
Those are just placeholders?

05:28.995 --> 05:31.998
-Well... That's where we're headed.
-[chuckles]

05:32.081 --> 05:37.170
-However, we have time to change--
-I've seen the wheels...

05:37.253 --> 05:39.922
You know I hate directional wheels, right?
You understand this as--

05:40.006 --> 05:41.299
-[colleague] I know now.
-[Ralph] They're too much.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.092
[colleague] We can work on it, right?

05:43.176 --> 05:46.387
No, I think it's a great design.
I'm really proud of you guys.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.346
Good.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.728
[Ralph] <i>If you ask someone at Ford or GM,</i>
<i>they could care less about Chrysler,</i>

05:53.811 --> 05:55.980
<i>they think Chrysler</i>
<i>is already a dead brand.</i>

05:57.356 --> 06:00.276
<i>So this concept car</i>
<i>is a huge investment for Chrysler.</i>

06:05.823 --> 06:08.576
<i>We don't want to just build</i>
<i>a fanciful concept car.</i>

06:08.659 --> 06:09.827
<i>That's easy to do.</i>

06:09.911 --> 06:11.746
Wow, there's a lot of work here.

06:12.622 --> 06:16.250
<i>This thing holds a lot of other</i>
<i>innovations that will be useful to us</i>

06:16.334 --> 06:17.668
<i>in a myriad of vehicles.</i>

06:19.921 --> 06:22.381
It still has a portal
that represents eyes.

06:22.465 --> 06:26.344
It celebrates the brand beautifully,
but it's like nothing else out there.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.515
<i>For the next few months, we're designing</i>
<i>everything your eye can see,</i>

06:30.598 --> 06:32.892
<i>the safety items, the infotainment...</i>

06:33.810 --> 06:37.271
<i>The design has to be so powerful</i>
<i>that it blows through all the paradigms</i>

06:37.355 --> 06:38.898
<i>and stands for something.</i>

06:41.192 --> 06:45.196
<i>We already own this minivan space,</i>
<i>but can we amplify it</i>

06:45.279 --> 06:48.407
<i>and have it mean something</i>
<i>to a whole bunch of people?</i>

06:48.491 --> 06:50.535
<i>Fleet companies, the whole autonomous car,</i>

06:50.618 --> 06:53.538
<i>there's so many ways we can take this,</i>
<i>so it's pretty big.</i>

06:55.665 --> 06:58.918
So the fate of the SM1 is riding on
a meeting we're having a month from now

06:59.001 --> 07:00.294
with the CEO of the company.

07:00.378 --> 07:04.132
If he likes it, it'll go to production,
perhaps, or at least as a concept car.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.677
If he doesn't like it, the whole thing
will pretty much just be scrapped.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.139
[church bell rings]

07:13.474 --> 07:17.728
The real genius is Ralph is charged
with designing a vehicle

07:17.812 --> 07:20.565
that millions of people
would want to buy, and like,

07:20.648 --> 07:23.943
as opposed to
a couple of hundred wealthy people,

07:24.026 --> 07:25.528
who want something outrageous.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.989
<i>And when you talk to car designers,</i>

07:28.072 --> 07:32.869
<i>you realize they're taking a styling cue</i>
<i>from something that was designed in 1938,</i>

07:32.952 --> 07:34.203
<i>some obscure car,</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:37.540
<i>but they remember that,</i>
<i>and they've integrated that into the...</i>

07:37.623 --> 07:40.293
You need all the information to do it now.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.337
Oh, look at this.

07:43.421 --> 07:50.136
This is another gorgeous, gorgeous Ferrari
with these beautiful double-cockpit looks.

07:52.221 --> 07:55.391
This vehicle only has one door,
and then there's no seam.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.227
They really didn't want
to waste the weight of the hinges

07:58.311 --> 08:01.481
or create any more aerodynamic drag,
so everything is seamless.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.858
Now that's for future reference! [laughs]

08:06.152 --> 08:07.653
<i>One of the reasons I went to </i>Mille Miglia

08:07.737 --> 08:10.656
<i>is to really dive into the most known race</i>
<i>in Italy,</i>

08:10.740 --> 08:15.286
<i>the most known event of the country</i>
<i>and be in it, to get it, to feel it.</i>

08:16.496 --> 08:18.122
<i>That inspires me.</i>

08:19.624 --> 08:21.250
[car horn beeps]

08:24.128 --> 08:26.047
-How you doing, Larry?
-Good morning!

08:26.130 --> 08:26.964
Morning, man!

08:27.548 --> 08:32.303
So this is Carina. I named her Carina
because it means "sweet woman" in Italian.

08:32.386 --> 08:36.557
She's a 1957 Super Sport Zagato...
Alfa Romeo, Zagato.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.727
What's cool about this car
is it's called the double bubble roof.

08:39.810 --> 08:41.604
If you can imagine, it didn't have that,

08:41.687 --> 08:44.232
it would be a very tall,
unattractive-looking roof.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.276
So designers had to figure out
a way to get the required clearance,

08:47.360 --> 08:48.694
but keep the vehicle as low,

08:48.778 --> 08:51.656
and punch the smallest hole
through the wind, as possible.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.492
And it's funny 'cause, actually,
our current Viper, and a lot of cars,

08:54.575 --> 08:57.245
have adopted this feature
in various forms.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.287
[Larry] It's special.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.749
I mean, there's maybe a dozen
that have the double bubble, so...

09:01.832 --> 09:04.669
[laughs] No. No, imagine how ugly
it would look.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.796
If you fill that in, it would be here.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.881
It would look terrible.
So I think that's cool.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.426
-Oh, I get it, so that was aesthetic.
-It's always about aesthetics.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.719
[laughs]

09:14.428 --> 09:15.346
It's awesome.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.435
I have no idea what that car was,
but I'm going to find out.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.520
[laughs]

09:22.603 --> 09:24.647
That's the other thing that's hitting me.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.984
<i>I was born in 1970, so many of these cars</i>
<i>are twice my age.</i>

09:29.694 --> 09:31.362
[upbeat music playing]

09:31.445 --> 09:34.323
<i>My love affair with cars came</i>
<i>from just walking around</i>

09:34.407 --> 09:35.908
<i>and seeing how ugly cars were.</i>

09:36.617 --> 09:40.037
<i>I grew up in Montreal, Quebec,</i>
<i>in the late '70s and early '80s.</i>

09:40.121 --> 09:41.914
I remember thinking to myself, "Ugh."

09:42.999 --> 09:46.002
<i>And then one day,</i>
<i>I saw a Porsche 911 Turbo.</i>

09:47.461 --> 09:49.255
<i>I think I was maybe nine years old.</i>

09:49.338 --> 09:50.339
And it struck me as being,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.883
"Why is that car more attractive
than the one next to it?"

09:53.718 --> 09:55.678
<i>And then I started noticing</i>
<i>more beautiful cars.</i>

09:57.013 --> 10:00.600
<i>I would watch </i>Smokey and the Bandit,
<i>the Trans Am, even Tom Selleck.</i>

10:00.683 --> 10:02.977
<i>I couldn't care less about Tom Selleck,</i>
<i>I'd watch the Ferrari.</i>

10:03.060 --> 10:06.647
[laughs] <i>And, of course, </i>Dukes of Hazzard<i>.</i>
<i>I used to watch it religiously.</i>

10:06.731 --> 10:09.066
I had to negotiate with my parents
my homework time

10:09.150 --> 10:10.151
and <i>Dukes of Hazzard </i>time.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.862
<i>So that's who I am, really simply.</i>

10:12.945 --> 10:16.282
<i>Someone who just woke up one day</i>
<i>and started noticing this machine.</i>

10:17.658 --> 10:20.828
<i>So I'm the product</i>
<i>of proud Haitian immigrants, you know.</i>

10:20.911 --> 10:24.332
<i>And my father had very high expectations</i>
<i>for me from the beginning.</i>

10:24.415 --> 10:28.294
<i>Extremely critical. I mean,</i>
<i>we didn't even have time to play.</i>

10:29.462 --> 10:30.755
<i>Part of the problem with my dad and I</i>

10:30.838 --> 10:33.382
<i>was he wanted me to be an engineer.</i>
<i>I wanted to be an artist.</i>

10:33.466 --> 10:35.718
And he didn't know what to do with me.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.472
<i>So I just stayed in my room</i>
<i>and drew a lot.</i>

10:41.057 --> 10:44.018
[Maxime] <i>My brother,</i>
<i>he started with stick figures of cars</i>

10:44.101 --> 10:47.813
and then eventually, they became...
they actually started looking like cars.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.400
<i>I think it was just</i>
<i>an innate gift that he had.</i>

10:52.652 --> 10:53.486
[Ralph] Okay.

10:54.862 --> 10:58.199
<i>But I guess the gnawing sensation</i>
<i>in the back of my mind was:</i>

10:58.282 --> 10:59.241
<i>"I can't let Dad down.</i>

10:59.325 --> 11:01.577
I'm not going to let him down.
I'll find a way to figure this out."

11:02.828 --> 11:03.913
[chuckles]

11:05.581 --> 11:07.917
I call this my folder of innocence.

11:10.294 --> 11:14.507
Wow, this is really old.
A Jeep Cherokee my dad had.

11:29.814 --> 11:33.150
[Boudette]<i> Chrysler, their image,</i>
<i>it's not the greatest.</i>

11:34.360 --> 11:36.904
They are the smallest
of the three automakers.

11:36.987 --> 11:43.035
They don't have strong brand images
the way Toyota or Honda or BMW do,

11:43.119 --> 11:46.580
<i>so they've really gotta fight</i>
<i>to get people to buy their cars,</i>

11:46.664 --> 11:49.875

11:53.003 --> 11:54.213
[colleague] Hey, Ralph.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.715
[Ralph] Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.928
<i>In our company, we have 21 nameplates</i>
<i>just on this side of the pond,</i>

12:01.011 --> 12:03.139
<i>and in Europe we have another 25 or so,</i>

12:03.222 --> 12:06.225
<i>so we have a lot of different cars</i>
<i>and we have multiple brands.</i>

12:06.851 --> 12:09.520
[man] We've added some things.
You can actually swipe songs now.

12:10.104 --> 12:10.980
I love that.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.942
[Ralph] <i>There's something more</i>
<i>to this than just designing.</i>

12:15.025 --> 12:18.028
<i>You have to manage talent,</i>
<i>'cause it takes an army.</i>

12:18.112 --> 12:21.407
This is a little bit too fine. I think
that could use a little more beef.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.408
This is nice.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.994
<i>I always try and imagine the future.</i>

12:25.786 --> 12:27.913
The feng shui piece of the screen
bothers me.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.040
Like, the fact that the screen
will be there all the time.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.750
Maybe it flips and then it adjusts?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.961
-We can do that.
-It has to be all James Bond.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.129
[imitates sliding screen]

12:35.212 --> 12:37.465
You're designing
for five years in the future,

12:37.548 --> 12:41.051
then you have to think about the car
living in market three to six years.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.053
<i>So you're looking at</i>
<i>a nine-year window of time</i>

12:43.137 --> 12:46.223
<i>that you have to consider</i>
<i>when you're creating these vehicles,</i>

12:46.807 --> 12:48.225
and that's... [laughs]

12:48.309 --> 12:49.143
It's daunting.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.397
<i>Jeep is in good shape,</i>
<i>RAM is doing extremely well,</i>

12:53.481 --> 12:55.357
<i>Dodge has found its way,</i>

12:55.441 --> 12:58.986
<i>but Chrysler's the one that has</i>
<i>the least amount of new nameplates.</i>

12:59.069 --> 13:01.113
<i>People must be wondering,</i>
<i>"What is Chrysler doing?</i>

13:01.197 --> 13:03.991
<i>They only have three nameplates.</i>
<i>They used to have eight or nine."</i>

13:04.074 --> 13:07.495
<i>So this concept car's important to say,</i>
<i>"Hey, we're investing in this brand,</i>

13:07.578 --> 13:10.039
<i>but we're changing the direction</i>
<i>of what the brand means."</i>

13:10.956 --> 13:14.543
<i>Last, but not least... All those</i>
<i>wanting to know your feelings on SM-1.</i>

13:14.627 --> 13:17.004
[colleague] A comment
on the fabrication side, Ralph.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.715
The roof glass
is probably going to have to be acrylic.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.759
I don't know exactly how to produce those,

13:21.842 --> 13:24.678
they're probably going to have to be
poured, machine polished.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.723
-[groans] Sounds expensive.
-Well, I don't know yet.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.518
We have to be finished with the car
two to four weeks ahead of time

13:30.601 --> 13:34.772
just to give the fabricator the time
to work out the bugs.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.899
I trust you guys, but let me know
if you come to...

13:36.982 --> 13:38.984
You're going to come to multiple forks
in the road.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.153
Just, you know,
I'd like to at least know.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.696
Yeah, okay.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.949
The CEO is going to review the car
on the 8th.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.700
July 8th, so--

13:46.784 --> 13:49.370
[Ralph] No, we gotta make that count.
That's a big show.

13:49.453 --> 13:53.541
Either way, that's going to be
a very juicy week, so... strap in.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.210
[futuristic music playing]

13:58.087 --> 13:59.380
<i>If this goes over properly,</i>

13:59.463 --> 14:02.091
<i>the bigger picture is that people</i>
<i>might change their perspective</i>

14:02.174 --> 14:04.969
<i>of what this company's all about,</i>
<i>where we're headed.</i>

14:05.678 --> 14:07.680
<i>You trust your gut instinct</i>
<i>that it's gonna work,</i>

14:07.763 --> 14:10.432
<i>and eventually it'll become</i>
<i>a trendsetting design.</i>

14:14.728 --> 14:17.106
<i>I think the best designs</i>
<i>are emotional forever.</i>

14:18.065 --> 14:21.610
<i>You see an older 300,</i>
<i>it's almost 11 years old now,</i>

14:21.694 --> 14:23.904
<i>and somehow they still look kind of cool,</i>

14:23.988 --> 14:26.448
<i>because that emotion was there</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

14:28.617 --> 14:32.329
<i>I was Chief of the Studio at the time</i>
<i>when this program was being developed.</i>

14:32.830 --> 14:35.332
<i>The grill became a big part</i>
<i>of the car's theme.</i>

14:35.416 --> 14:37.376
<i>But really, it harkened back</i>
<i>to the Virgil Exner</i>

14:37.459 --> 14:40.462
<i>of '50s cars with aggressive,</i>
<i>oversized hoods.</i>

14:41.297 --> 14:43.799
<i>Holding that DNA strand</i>
<i>is so critical to me.</i>

14:45.301 --> 14:48.512
We kept making the grill
bigger and bigger and bigger,

14:48.596 --> 14:49.555
until it felt right.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.475
[Boudette]<i> It was a sensation.</i>
<i>And when it came out,</i>

14:53.559 --> 14:58.147
<i>it was unlike anything we had seen</i>
<i>from an American car company in years.</i>

15:00.816 --> 15:03.903
[Leno]<i> The 300 was one</i>
<i>of Ralph's great designs</i>

15:03.986 --> 15:08.616
because it has almost an African-American,
urban presence to it.

15:09.617 --> 15:13.287
<i>It's got street cred, it looks cool.</i>

15:14.121 --> 15:18.292
[Boudette]<i> He gave it these sleek windows,</i>
<i>a long hood and a short trunk,</i>

15:18.375 --> 15:23.130
<i>and that gives it an impression of speed,</i>
<i>even when it's stopped.</i>

15:25.090 --> 15:28.052
It just had kind of a badass look to it,

15:28.135 --> 15:31.472
and a lot of people who really
didn't pay attention to Chrysler

15:31.555 --> 15:33.599
<i>would know, "Oh! That's the 300."</i>

15:35.351 --> 15:37.561
[Ralph] <i>The hip-hop crowd</i>
<i>took it under its wing.</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:40.814
<i>The vehicle looks great</i>
<i>and it was affordable.</i>

15:41.732 --> 15:43.317
<i>It was a pretty big deal for us.</i>

15:47.154 --> 15:51.033
<i>We create a vehicle that someone</i>
<i>will not just own, but will cherish,</i>

15:51.116 --> 15:52.910
<i>will create a community around,</i>

15:52.993 --> 15:53.994
<i>and it's amazing.</i>

15:55.663 --> 15:57.331
[cars zooming]

[motors hum]

16:03.128 --> 16:04.838
<i>I have an inner racer inside of me.</i>

16:04.922 --> 16:07.091
<i>I've been watching racing</i>
<i>since I was a kid.</i>

16:10.010 --> 16:13.097
<i>I went to four different driving schools</i>
<i>in a span of six years</i>

16:13.180 --> 16:14.556
<i>and briefly competed.</i>

16:15.516 --> 16:17.851
<i>But the part that speaks to me,</i>
<i>even to this day,</i>

16:17.935 --> 16:19.728
<i>and why I go out of my way to do it...</i>

16:20.646 --> 16:21.814
<i>is the escape.</i>

16:27.611 --> 16:31.156
<i>When I'm driving a car,</i>
<i>literally, the world melts away.</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:37.997
<i>You and the machine melt together.</i>

16:39.957 --> 16:43.836
<i>Everything kind of goes in slow motion</i>
<i>and you're dancing with the car.</i>

16:43.919 --> 16:45.963
[calming music playing]

16:49.967 --> 16:51.218
<i>I come alive in a way.</i>

16:53.303 --> 16:54.972
[cars zooming]

16:59.518 --> 17:02.563
<i>The Viper is a big part</i>
<i>of what turned me on about Chrysler.</i>

17:03.981 --> 17:07.484
<i>At the time the Viper came out,</i>
<i>it had double the horsepower of a Mustang.</i>

17:07.568 --> 17:09.278
<i>It was the fastest car you could buy.</i>

17:10.654 --> 17:13.991
<i>Insanely large engine,</i>
<i>a V10 that was eight liters,</i>

17:14.074 --> 17:15.200
<i>I mean, just enormous.</i>

17:16.118 --> 17:19.204
<i>And you could buy that car</i>
<i>for less than $50,000 when it came out.</i>

17:19.288 --> 17:20.581
<i>So it was unheard of.</i>

17:22.082 --> 17:25.586
<i>One of my favorite parts of this car</i>
<i>is not even the car itself,</i>

17:25.669 --> 17:28.672
it's actually something
that happened when I picked it up.

17:28.756 --> 17:32.885
So this is the very first ACR
to come off the line at Conner,

17:32.968 --> 17:34.803
where they make all the Vipers.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.056
And a lot of the people here
are very special.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.267
They love this plant, you know,
it's kind of a second home for them.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.729
<i>So when I went to pick up my car,</i>
<i>they started signing the car.</i>

17:44.313 --> 17:47.691
<i>I think they knew in their mind</i>
<i>this car would be used as intended.</i>

17:48.776 --> 17:52.362
Dave Bailey, he was Head of Engineer
for SRT for a very long time.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.157
And here's Rustard Daselli,
he just retired,

17:55.240 --> 17:58.202
he ran SRT with me
for the last four and a half years,

17:58.285 --> 17:59.453
so, great people.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.663
I can't even... This is priceless.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.291
I will never sell this car
because of this, so...

18:04.875 --> 18:06.376
[upbeat music playing]

18:09.046 --> 18:12.549
<i>The acronym for SRT means</i>
<i>Street & Racing Technology.</i>

18:12.633 --> 18:13.801
[revving]

18:14.468 --> 18:15.969
It's music, it's music.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.722
<i>SRT was always about the Viper,</i>

18:18.806 --> 18:21.809
<i>and then we started to fan out</i>
<i>its personality on the 300.</i>

18:22.893 --> 18:25.646
<i>So we lowered the suspension,</i>
<i>made it look really sporty.</i>

18:25.729 --> 18:28.357
<i>We showed it to management,</i>
<i>and they couldn't deny it. They're like,</i>

18:28.440 --> 18:31.193
<i>"There's something cool about that,"</i>
<i>then one thing led to another,</i>

18:31.276 --> 18:33.987
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>
<i>the SRT started going nuts.</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:36.031
<i>We went from having two SRTs to ten.</i>

18:38.450 --> 18:41.328
[Leno] <i>America's always been about</i>
<i>value for the dollar.</i>

18:41.411 --> 18:44.456
<i>You get Lamborghini, Ferrari performance</i>

18:44.957 --> 18:48.001
in a car that the average American
could aspire to.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.213
<i>I mean, it's the American success story.</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:55.843
[Ralph] <i>The non-spoken part</i>
<i>of the SRT phenomenon</i>

18:55.926 --> 18:58.011
<i>is the owners become kindred spirits.</i>

18:58.095 --> 19:00.347
<i>They see each other</i>
<i>on the road, they wave at each other,</i>

19:00.430 --> 19:03.308
<i>they go to car club events together,</i>
<i>they become friends because of the car.</i>

19:03.392 --> 19:05.978
<i>Some people buy the SRTs</i>
<i>to be part of the community.</i>

19:06.061 --> 19:07.354
Hey, John! Nice driving.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.232
That was outstanding, by the way.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.234
<i>That's a powerful thing.</i>

19:12.317 --> 19:15.028
<i>I mean, it transcends much more</i>
<i>than what we do as designers.</i>

19:15.112 --> 19:16.905
<i>It becomes popular culture.</i>

19:17.656 --> 19:19.241
<i>And I think that's pretty cool.</i>

19:20.659 --> 19:23.162
-[Doris] Ready, honey?
-[Ralph] Uh-oh, it's time. All right.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.581
Man, you make me work hard.

-All right.
-You ready?

19:29.376 --> 19:31.170
Yep. [whispers] Okay...

19:31.253 --> 19:33.839
[Ralph] Gonna wave the flag
for Alfa Romeo today

19:33.922 --> 19:35.382
and moms all over the world.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.466
[Doris laughs]

19:37.968 --> 19:42.514
Way back when, I used to sit there
with a stopwatch and a pad of paper

19:42.598 --> 19:46.351
and have to, like, record every lap
and all his lap times.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.104
[Ralph] You're doing good.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.939

[Ralph]<i> </i>Let's call this
your acceleration point.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.072

-all the way to the braking zone.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.119
[Doris] <i>Ralph is intense.</i>

20:04.203 --> 20:06.747
Like when he was teaching me
how to drive a stick,

20:06.830 --> 20:11.251
like, if I get all flustered and I'm like,
"That's it, I'm done for today,"

20:11.335 --> 20:12.920
he'll be like, "You get back in there."

20:13.003 --> 20:15.088
[Ralph] Partial acceleration now,

20:15.172 --> 20:16.465
and full right now.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.218
Go. Full throttle, full throttle.

20:19.301 --> 20:23.430
[Doris] <i>But you know, he pushes me</i>
<i>and challenges me, so it's all good.</i>

20:35.359 --> 20:38.153
[Ralph]<i> It's probably the toughest time</i>
<i>to be a designer in this industry,</i>

<i>Some of my best designers are working</i>
<i>for Korean companies now.</i>

20:44.326 --> 20:46.870
<i>Have you noticed</i>
<i>the KIAs look pretty good lately? </i>[laughs]

20:48.080 --> 20:50.749
The only thing I would say,
the feeling of the structure...

20:50.832 --> 20:54.753
It feels like a giant nipple.
Like you're toying with a teat.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.547
-[all laugh]
-Yeah.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.218
[Ralph] If there's a way
to somehow put a cup in there to...

21:01.301 --> 21:02.803
-To kind of--
-[colleague] Guide you.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.054
You're not going to roll it, right?

21:04.137 --> 21:07.474
<i>The interiors have become</i>
<i>the new battleground for car design.</i>

21:08.183 --> 21:11.687
<i>We design every square inch</i>

<i>make sure it's holistic.</i>

21:13.230 --> 21:15.065
<i>To make it beautiful, functional.</i>

21:16.149 --> 21:19.069
<i>We're thinking of a whole new way</i>

<i>but living in your car,</i>
<i>third-space solutions,</i>

21:21.655 --> 21:23.615
<i>where you take what you love</i>
<i>about your home</i>

21:23.699 --> 21:25.534
<i>into your transportation solution.</i>

21:26.118 --> 21:30.289
So, our interior design team,
who can speak to the third-space idea?

21:30.372 --> 21:32.457
[colleague] The promise of autonomy,

21:32.541 --> 21:34.042
a different way to interact
with your vehicle.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.503
You're no longer controlling it,
you're more living in it.

21:36.586 --> 21:40.549
So you have a cabin, which looks like
Daniel Boone would live there,

21:40.632 --> 21:43.260
and then you have something
that Iron Man would live in.

21:43.343 --> 21:46.388
I mean, glancing at them,
I don't know if I see coziness.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.347
[colleague] Yeah.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.766
[Ralph] 'Cause we've all been
to high-end hotels.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.394
You go in the room, it's like,
I don't know, not cozy.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.021
It's cool, but it's not cozy, you know?

21:54.104 --> 21:55.522
I'd rather be...

21:55.605 --> 21:57.941
But I love these,
they're very inspirational.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.822
<i>We're living in exciting times.</i>

22:03.905 --> 22:07.326
<i>I love the fact that there's</i>
<i>all this change, all this futurism.</i>

22:08.201 --> 22:12.331
Once a vehicle becomes autonomous,
the driver also becomes the passenger.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.084
[Ralph] <i>It's exciting to talk</i>
<i>about autonomous cars.</i>

22:17.669 --> 22:21.548
<i>But when you think of autonomous cars,</i>
<i>you don't necessarily think of Detroit.</i>

22:21.631 --> 22:22.507
<i>Right?</i>

22:23.008 --> 22:24.885
And that kind of makes me mad.

22:24.968 --> 22:28.180
<i>We're gonna catch up in a big way.</i>
<i>If anything, we need to lead.</i>

22:28.847 --> 22:30.140
[Boudette]<i> There's a push now</i>

22:30.223 --> 22:33.602
to have a national test center
for autonomous vehicles

22:33.685 --> 22:34.603
here in Michigan.

22:36.271 --> 22:38.482
<i>Detroit is going to play a big, big role</i>

22:38.565 --> 22:43.111
<i>in how autonomous vehicles</i>
<i>become part of our lives.</i>

22:44.071 --> 22:47.199
[colleague] The beauty of this vehicle
being level four autonomous,

22:47.282 --> 22:49.743
it allows the steering wheel device

22:49.826 --> 22:52.662
to be able to tuck away
and come out towards you.

22:52.746 --> 22:56.708
It creates drama and theater
when the car is turned on or turned off.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.503
You can feel like
you're witnessing something special.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.673
You're changing the discussion,
we're all changing the discussion

23:03.757 --> 23:06.551
of can a car be a place
you look forward to being in.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.553
Not something you just sit in
and you get there,

23:08.637 --> 23:11.723
but it's actually a... it truly is
an extension of your home.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.896

<i>by this autonomous car movement.</i>

23:19.648 --> 23:21.858
<i>As a leader of design</i>
<i>for a major corporation,</i>

23:21.942 --> 23:24.528
<i>I have to step outside of my own body</i>

23:24.611 --> 23:27.364
<i>and understand what the story</i>
<i>of autonomous cars is.</i>

23:28.365 --> 23:29.574
<i>You would get it on the freeway,</i>

23:29.658 --> 23:32.744
<i>then, once it's cruising,</i>
<i>the interior should reconfigure itself.</i>

23:32.828 --> 23:34.287
<i>We have to respond to that.</i>

23:34.746 --> 23:40.127
<i>But, the romantic car lover in me wonders</i>
<i>if one day, if everything is automated,</i>

23:40.210 --> 23:42.838
<i>do people care about the car anymore,</i>
<i>or is it just another device?</i>

23:43.630 --> 23:45.048
Just like a train or something,

23:45.132 --> 23:47.259
or some other device
to get to work or whatever.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.596
<i>But there's still</i>
<i>this solid base of people</i>

23:51.680 --> 23:55.517
<i>that just love the freedom</i>
<i>and making their own decisions.</i>

23:57.060 --> 23:58.603
I just hope we always have that choice

23:58.687 --> 24:03.400
versus it being mandated to us,
what we're supposed to drive or not drive.

24:03.483 --> 24:04.734
[car zooms]

24:19.916 --> 24:24.004
[Maxime] My father loved cool cars,
so inherently we just liked cars,

24:24.087 --> 24:28.550
but we didn't have the privilege of having
all of these cool cars in our driveway.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.596
Who made these cars so low? [groans]

24:34.014 --> 24:37.225
[Maxime]<i> Again, you have to remember,</i>
<i>my dad was old school, you know.</i>

24:37.309 --> 24:40.187
Doctor, engineer, lawyer,
that's the only thing.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.148
[Ralph] <i>He knew I was mechanical.</i>

24:43.231 --> 24:45.567
<i>I enjoyed the mechanical side</i>
<i>of the automobile as well,</i>

24:45.650 --> 24:48.111
but the artistic side really appealed
to me much more.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.863
The idea of taste making.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.285
<i>So my aunt, who was a teacher herself,</i>

24:55.368 --> 24:58.580
<i>saw something in that and wanted me</i>
<i>to cultivate the artistic side.</i>

24:58.663 --> 24:59.873
<i>She was big on that.</i>

25:00.582 --> 25:03.251
<i>And she most aggressively said,</i>
<i>"Hey, what are you going to do</i>

25:03.335 --> 25:04.836
<i>with this thing you like to do?"</i>

25:05.337 --> 25:08.423
<i>At the time, Lee Iacocca was</i>
<i>making those famous commercials:</i>

25:08.506 --> 25:10.926
[Ralph and Iacocca]
"If you can find a better car, buy it."

25:12.177 --> 25:13.762
<i>My aunt goes, "Lee Iacocca,</i>
<i>that guy on TV,</i>

25:13.845 --> 25:16.056
<i>write him a letter</i>
<i>and show him your drawings,</i>

25:16.139 --> 25:18.141
<i>'cause you should work</i>
<i>for that car company."</i>

25:19.100 --> 25:20.685
<i>It seemed so improbable.</i>

25:21.019 --> 25:24.397
<i>Why this little kid from Montreal</i>
<i>would be of any significance to them.</i>

25:25.023 --> 25:26.733
<i>But it felt like, "Hey, why not?"</i>

25:29.319 --> 25:30.946
<i>They actually wrote back to me.</i>

25:32.239 --> 25:36.576
"Dear Ralph, Mr. Iacocca has asked
that I answer your letter for him.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.328
I looked over your portfolio

25:38.411 --> 25:42.290
and believe that you have the potential
to have a career in automotive design."

25:42.374 --> 25:44.042
<i>They recommended a few schools,</i>

25:44.125 --> 25:47.545
<i>design schools that were in Michigan,</i>
<i>in Cleveland, and California.</i>

25:47.629 --> 25:49.422
"...Center for Creative Studies...

25:49.506 --> 25:51.174
I hope I've been of some help to you.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.468
Your portfolio does show
significant promise.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.262
Regards, Neil Walling."

26:07.190 --> 26:09.067
[director] Does it move you,
when you read that?

26:11.152 --> 26:12.112
Mm-hmm.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.369
<i>Because of that letter,</i>

26:19.452 --> 26:22.289
<i>I felt a certain draw and loyalty</i>
<i>to Chrysler.</i>

26:28.295 --> 26:30.797
<i>So we've been working on this idea</i>
<i>in terms of a solution</i>

26:30.880 --> 26:33.300
<i>for millennial vehicles</i>
<i>for about two years.</i>

26:34.634 --> 26:36.386
<i>We've been going out</i>
<i>to speak to millennials,</i>

26:36.469 --> 26:39.139
<i>just traveling across the country,</i>
<i>literally in their living rooms.</i>

26:39.764 --> 26:43.351
<i>They often describe their issues,</i>
<i>their problems they're trying to solve.</i>

26:43.435 --> 26:46.354
<i>As designers, we kind of listen in</i>
<i>really carefully to the problem</i>

26:46.438 --> 26:48.315
<i>and say,</i>
<i>"Okay, today there isn't a vehicle</i>

26:48.398 --> 26:50.609
<i>that solves two of those problems</i>
<i>at the same time."</i>

26:51.484 --> 26:54.446
<i>We're trying to create products</i>
<i>that solve multiple problems,</i>

26:54.529 --> 26:56.364
<i>and in so doing, you create</i>
<i>a white space,</i>

26:56.448 --> 26:58.033
<i>meaning there's nothing there.</i>
<i>It's a canvas.</i>

26:58.116 --> 27:00.368
<i>It's wide open</i>
<i>for you to develop the answer.</i>

27:05.081 --> 27:09.419
What do you guys think about
scrunching down the bumper pad?

27:10.128 --> 27:10.962
Or the...

27:11.046 --> 27:11.880
[indistinct chatter]

27:11.963 --> 27:14.924
It would look so much better
with a little more breathing room.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.259
[colleague] The bumper...

27:16.343 --> 27:18.261
Hey, Dunford,
I think you're going to like it.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.430
If you like it, I like it.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.931
[scoffs] Stop!

27:22.932 --> 27:25.852
When I grow up, I want to be a yes-man.
[laughs] Just...

27:27.062 --> 27:28.605
Any comments from anyone else?

27:29.356 --> 27:32.359
Everything is pretty symmetrical,
but yet the wheel isn't.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.485
[Dunford] Glad you said that.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.320
-Let's go look at it.
-[Ralph] All right.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.406
I mean, the easy fix is
to stretch the wheel base.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.617
-Now. Not...
-[chuckles] Yeah.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.577
A year from now, it will very hard.

27:43.536 --> 27:47.624
One area I keep staring at
is the radius on especially the rear door,

27:47.707 --> 27:49.167
as it transitions.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.711
And I think now,
if you move that wheel back...

27:51.795 --> 27:53.838
-Can you--
-Let it breathe?

27:53.922 --> 27:56.383
Let it breathe. It feels like it's forcing
its way around the wheel.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.052
You can actually see
the highlight crashing with that.

27:59.135 --> 28:01.179
The front one is perfect. Let's do that.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.015
Let's call it 40 mils,
I think 40 mils is perfect.

28:04.933 --> 28:08.144
-You can go too far quick, you know?
-[colleague] Oh, yeah. You can. Yeah.

28:08.269 --> 28:11.356
[Ralph] It'll come alive.
No, nice job. What can I say?

28:11.439 --> 28:12.941
-Good stuff.
-Thank you.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.111
-Good stuff.
-Sounds good.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.321
Good stuff, John. No, no, you get a hug.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.406
[laughter]

28:20.031 --> 28:21.699
[Ralph] <i>If you think about</i>
<i>family formation</i>

28:21.783 --> 28:23.743
<i>and the way</i>
<i>people have transported families,</i>

28:23.827 --> 28:27.122
<i>you had the station wagon,</i>
<i>then you had the minivan.</i>

28:28.706 --> 28:29.624
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

28:29.708 --> 28:33.878
<i>you had a vehicle that was</i>
<i>80% people space, 20% mechanical space</i>

28:33.962 --> 28:35.130
<i>in terms of volume.</i>

28:36.131 --> 28:37.465
<i>People recognize that right away.</i>

28:38.383 --> 28:41.344
<i>And from 1984 onwards,</i>
<i>it has been a success story.</i>

28:44.139 --> 28:45.348
[hopeful music playing]

28:45.432 --> 28:47.976
[Leno]<i> They've always been</i>
<i>sort of boom or bust.</i>

28:48.059 --> 28:50.854
<i>The K-car.</i>
<i>Oh, we did a million jokes about that.</i>

28:50.937 --> 28:53.815
Cars A through J, how bad were they
if this is the K-car?

28:54.607 --> 28:57.360
[Boudette] <i>The irony is they took</i>
<i>the base of the K-car,</i>

28:57.444 --> 29:01.030
and they put a big roof on it
and turned it into the minivan.

29:01.114 --> 29:01.948
[applause]

29:02.031 --> 29:03.575
[Leno] <i>Boom!</i>
<i>They're rolling in dough again.</i>

29:03.658 --> 29:05.201
<i>They're making a ton of dough,</i>

29:05.285 --> 29:08.329
but you've got to reinvent yourself
every single year

29:08.413 --> 29:09.414
in the automobile business.

29:11.332 --> 29:14.002
[Ralph] <i>1987, the Portofino</i>
<i>concept car came out.</i>

29:14.919 --> 29:16.588
<i>I remember seeing that concept car</i>

29:16.671 --> 29:19.382
<i>and going, "Whoa, here are</i>
<i>the people that make the Caravan."</i>

29:19.632 --> 29:20.633
<i>And it floored me.</i>

29:22.427 --> 29:23.261
<i>The '90s.</i>

29:25.388 --> 29:26.973
<i>That's when the company was healthy.</i>

29:28.933 --> 29:31.060
<i>The Concord came out, the LHS,</i>

29:34.147 --> 29:35.648
<i>the Chronos concept,</i>

29:36.775 --> 29:38.151
<i>the 300 concept...</i>

29:38.651 --> 29:41.362
<i>to try to remind the world</i>
<i>that we had that in us.</i>

29:46.785 --> 29:49.120
<i>It's funny how it kind of goes...</i>

29:49.204 --> 29:51.456
<i>Like, you're flying high,</i>
<i>then you hit a wall,</i>

29:51.539 --> 29:53.708
<i>you hit an economic something</i>
<i>and then you're low again,</i>

29:53.792 --> 29:56.628
[stammers] <i>and then you always try</i>
<i>to get back to that.</i>

29:56.711 --> 29:58.004
<i>That happy place.</i>

29:59.798 --> 30:02.509
<i>We think the house is steady right now,</i>

30:02.592 --> 30:08.139
<i>so it's time again to do a vehicle that</i>
<i>tells the world where we want to be going.</i>

30:12.268 --> 30:14.229
<i>Taste making takes time.</i>

30:15.688 --> 30:18.358
<i>I believe what we do as designers</i>
<i>is create taste.</i>

30:19.025 --> 30:19.901
Hello!

30:20.902 --> 30:23.029
All right, where am I going to be,
right here?

30:23.112 --> 30:25.949
<i>Sometimes we're a little bit ahead</i>
<i>of culture, or ahead of the times</i>

30:26.032 --> 30:28.785
<i>and we challenge it</i>
<i>and we hear that noise.</i>

30:29.577 --> 30:31.621
<i>It happens all the time</i>
<i>on a creative vehicle</i>

30:31.704 --> 30:33.748
<i>that is either loved or very much hated.</i>

30:34.791 --> 30:37.877
The way it's laid out on the table,
it's cozy, earthy and then...

30:37.961 --> 30:39.045
-Yes.
-technical.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.674
-There are stories behind that.
-There are stories behind that.

30:42.757 --> 30:45.051
[Ralph]<i> So the perfect example</i>
<i>is the Jeep Cherokee,</i>

30:45.134 --> 30:46.886
<i>very controversial vehicle.</i>

30:46.970 --> 30:50.598
<i>We came at it with a different objective:</i>
<i>to shock people, almost.</i>

30:50.682 --> 30:53.476
<i>It has a very unique face,</i>
<i>but it's still a Jeep.</i>

30:55.395 --> 30:56.980
<i>But with the Jeep brand it's different,</i>

30:57.063 --> 30:58.857
<i>because you have a brand</i>
<i>that's as recognized</i>

30:58.940 --> 31:00.275
<i>as Disney and Coca-Cola,</i>

31:00.358 --> 31:03.778
and people tend to watch what you do,
so if you get it wrong,

31:03.862 --> 31:05.196
you get it really wrong.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.243
[Boudette] <i>Jeep is</i>
<i>the most important brand Chrysler has.</i>

31:10.326 --> 31:12.370
<i>And you want to talk about pressure,</i>

31:12.453 --> 31:16.791
doing a new vehicle from scratch
is about a billion-dollar investment.

31:18.251 --> 31:21.129
<i>So you've got to know</i>
<i>what consumers are going to want</i>

31:21.212 --> 31:23.464
<i>even before consumers</i>
<i>know what they want.</i>

31:24.966 --> 31:28.595
The main show car
that represents the future wants to be...

31:29.679 --> 31:32.432
That's kind of where my...
just my instincts.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.476
-Sounds good.
-What do you guys think?

31:35.852 --> 31:37.896
-We were more--
-You're there.

31:37.979 --> 31:38.855
Yeah.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.651
[Ralph] <i>I can barely sleep when we're</i>
<i>in the throes of those projects.</i>

31:43.735 --> 31:46.154
It's like, "Oh, my gosh, I have
so many customers to make happy,

31:46.237 --> 31:49.115
and we haven't even started talking
about the ones on the outside."

32:03.004 --> 32:06.424
<i>And over time, it just looks better</i>
<i>as people become more familiar.</i>

32:09.302 --> 32:12.889
<i>And all of a sudden, it becomes</i>
<i>the new thing and others emulate it.</i>

32:14.724 --> 32:16.559
<i>You have to have the intestinal fortitude</i>

32:16.643 --> 32:18.937
<i>to be able to kind of make it</i>
<i>through that initial step</i>

32:19.020 --> 32:22.440
<i>and also recognize designs</i>
<i>that will age gracefully.</i>

32:22.523 --> 32:24.609
...come up with
some color options, for sure..

32:25.735 --> 32:28.529
It definitely feels anti-car,
and I really don't like the wheels.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.366
-But we'll talk about that another time.
-Yeah, yeah. Yep.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.701
When do we run out of time?
I know we--

32:33.785 --> 32:38.039
We're working towards the 7/8 show
and it'll be a show like this.

32:38.831 --> 32:39.791
Better wheels.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.502
Better wheels,
we'll get you better wheels, for sure.

32:44.712 --> 32:48.216
[Ralph] <i>My whole life, I programmed myself</i>
<i>to believe I would become an engineer,</i>

32:48.299 --> 32:49.258
<i>just go that direction.</i>

32:49.342 --> 32:52.345
<i>And for me, it was always,</i>
<i>"Okay, let's go. Let's do this."</i>

32:52.428 --> 32:54.430
<i>I went to college in Canada,</i>

32:54.514 --> 32:57.850
and I'll never forget...
I felt this hollow sensation in my heart,

32:57.934 --> 33:00.353
like, "Is this going to be
the path I take?"

33:00.436 --> 33:02.438
[instrumental music playing]

33:02.981 --> 33:04.232
<i>I remember being in school</i>

33:04.315 --> 33:06.317
<i>and everything started turning</i>
<i>a different language.</i>

33:06.401 --> 33:07.610
<i>I wasn't understanding it,</i>

33:07.694 --> 33:10.363
<i>I was trying to sketch</i>
<i>and struggling with it.</i>

33:11.155 --> 33:13.825
Then eventually, after...
I don't even think it was even five weeks,

33:13.908 --> 33:16.869
I dropped out.
I literally dropped out of college.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.956
<i>I didn't know how to break it to my dad.</i>

33:20.039 --> 33:22.583
<i>I mean, I couldn't even</i>
<i>form the words in my mouth.</i>

33:23.251 --> 33:26.129
<i>I didn't expect that it was going to be</i>
<i>so cold in the house.</i>

33:26.212 --> 33:29.590
<i>Every day I'd come home and it was like</i>
<i>you could just sense the disgust.</i>

33:29.674 --> 33:31.968
<i>You could just sense this kind of</i>
<i>"What has happened?"</i>

33:36.389 --> 33:38.391
<i>Probably, in many ways, my darkest hour.</i>

33:50.361 --> 33:54.323
<i>Starting in 1998,</i>
<i>it was yet another dark period.</i>

33:54.407 --> 33:55.575
<i>And I felt it coming.</i>

33:56.284 --> 33:57.952
<i>When I heard</i>
<i>we were merging with Mercedes,</i>

33:58.036 --> 34:00.121
<i>I'm like, "Why? We're fine.</i>
<i>We don't need that."</i>

34:00.621 --> 34:04.000
<i>And then, two years into the deal,</i>
<i>things were strange.</i>

34:05.334 --> 34:08.129
<i>You could feel the product</i>
<i>being under-invested in.</i>

34:09.338 --> 34:11.841
<i>And it absolutely</i>
<i>almost cost us our livelihood,</i>

34:11.924 --> 34:13.551
<i>and cost us the entire company.</i>

34:16.304 --> 34:19.974
<i>Mercedes divested</i>
<i>and pretty much left us for dead.</i>

34:21.142 --> 34:23.561
<i>A private equity firm came in</i>
<i>and bought us.</i>

34:23.770 --> 34:24.979
<i>It was horrible.</i>

34:26.898 --> 34:30.651
<i>So I became Head of Design in 2008,</i>
<i>but they moved me under Engineering.</i>

34:31.194 --> 34:32.779
<i>And that's a kiss of death.</i>

34:33.279 --> 34:35.698
<i>That just says that design</i>
<i>is a function of engineering,</i>

34:35.782 --> 34:37.408
<i>not an important piece.</i>

34:39.786 --> 34:43.414
<i>On top of the product being sick,</i>
<i>there was an economic downturn coming</i>

34:43.498 --> 34:45.124
<i>and it was just a perfect storm.</i>

34:48.461 --> 34:51.547
<i>Two months later, they enacted</i>
<i>a voluntary termination program</i>

I think spiritually,
it very much is not only the future,

39:53.265 --> 39:57.561
where you just have beautiful execution,
beautiful surfacing,
