<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:17.726 --> 00:20.353
<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:20.437 --> 00:22.856
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:22.939 --> 00:25.859
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:25.942 --> 00:28.528
<i>Under here, over there</i>

00:28.611 --> 00:31.031
<i>Science is everywhere you look</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:33.783
<i>With Iggy Peck, architect</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:36.453
<i>And Rosie Revere, engineer</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:39.164
<i>So much to do and you can help too!</i>

00:39.247 --> 00:42.000
<i>A mystery, a riddle, a puzzle or a quest</i>

00:42.083 --> 00:45.128
<i>There are wonders to discover</i>
<i>And hypotheses to test</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:46.546
<i>Science is the best!</i>

00:46.629 --> 00:49.132
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:51.926
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:52.010 --> 00:56.222
<i>Everywhere science is</i>
<i>She’s forming a hypothesis</i>

00:56.306 --> 00:59.601
<i>Connecting all the dots</i>
<i>’Cause this is Scientist Ada Twist!</i>

01:08.651 --> 01:13.281
Soft, comfortable,
perfectly positioned in front of the TV.

01:13.364 --> 01:16.284
Juice in easy reaching distance.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.496
-And perfectly popped popcorn!
-Iggy and Rosie are here.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.290
-Hi, Ada!
-Heya!

01:22.373 --> 01:25.752
I’m so glad you could both come
to my first-ever movie night.

01:25.835 --> 01:28.338
I spent all day getting everything ready.

01:28.421 --> 01:32.425
I even invented the Popcorn Launcherette!

01:33.051 --> 01:34.469
That’s amazing!

01:34.552 --> 01:36.721
-How does it work?
-Let me show you.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.349
Open wide!

01:41.851 --> 01:42.852
-Hey!
-Oops!

01:42.936 --> 01:45.855
Stop it! I think something’s wrong
with your machine!

01:49.818 --> 01:52.028
Oops. Sorry.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.615
That’s why a new invention
always needs a lot of testing.

01:55.698 --> 01:59.244
-Just ask Thomas Edison.
-The guy who invented the light bulb?

01:59.327 --> 02:03.873
Yep! He tested 10,000 different ways
to make a light bulb before it worked.

02:03.957 --> 02:10.213
Thank fairy-ness he didn’t stop at 9,999.
Then we wouldn’t have all this light.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.297
-Oh, yeah.
-Cool!

02:11.381 --> 02:14.217
Excuse me.
Is this the Ada Twist movie theatre?

02:14.300 --> 02:17.887
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mum.
And yes it is. Thanks for coming.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.224
Let’s see. This way, please.
Your seats are right here.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.642
So, what are we watching?

02:22.725 --> 02:24.769
I wanted tonight to be perfect,

02:24.853 --> 02:28.314
so I picked out a movie
using very precise calculations.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.859
-It has 44% adventure…
-Cool!

02:30.942 --> 02:31.860
Sweet!

02:31.943 --> 02:33.570
32% percent action…

02:33.653 --> 02:35.113
-Yeah!
-Cool.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.615
And 24% romance.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.700
-Nice.
-Sweet!

02:39.284 --> 02:42.036
Mum and Dad,
please silence your mobile phones.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.748
And now,
it’s time for our feature presentation,

02:45.832 --> 02:48.710
<i>Snuggle Warriors 3!</i>

02:50.795 --> 02:52.463
What?! No!

02:52.547 --> 02:55.175
Come on! Not tonight!

02:55.258 --> 02:57.385
Okay, just going to investigate.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.682
I see the problem.
The power is down on the whole street.

03:02.765 --> 03:03.933
No!

03:04.017 --> 03:07.103
Oh no!
The power is down on the whole street?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.688
Movie night’s ruined.

03:08.771 --> 03:12.483
Baby, don’t worry.
A power cut is no big deal.

03:12.567 --> 03:16.529
Yeah. Going electricity-free can be fun.
Like travelling back in time.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.656
I want to travel back in time
to this morning

03:18.740 --> 03:21.367
so I can eat my dad’s
blueberry pancakes again.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.621
But what are we going to do
about movie night?

03:24.704 --> 03:27.624
We can’t watch our movie
without electricity.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.919
Sometimes these things take a while.
We gotta be patient.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.630
Your dad and I will find
the backup power generator.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.089
To the garage!

03:35.840 --> 03:39.219
This is not
how I wanted my first movie night to go.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.262
I know what’ll cheer you up.

03:41.346 --> 03:45.433
Rosie Rule number 32.
Always have balloons with you.

03:49.312 --> 03:53.691
A lucky elephant for Ada,
a puppy pal for Mooshu Kitty,

03:55.360 --> 03:57.403
and a cool crown for Iggy.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.156
My hair!

04:01.324 --> 04:03.368
You look like a mad scientist!

04:03.993 --> 04:06.329
I’m going to take over the world!

04:08.331 --> 04:12.460
Sorry, Iggy. Forgot that balloons
can create static electricity.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.297
That just gave me an elec-terrific idea.

04:16.381 --> 04:20.218
-What is it?
-We made static electricity with these.

04:20.301 --> 04:24.222
Yep, I’d say it feels pretty static-y.
And electric-y.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.724
Instead of waiting
for the power to come back on,

04:26.808 --> 04:29.352
why don’t we try
making our own electricity?

04:29.435 --> 04:32.981
Love the can-do attitude.
But can we do that?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.942
Sure.
Electricity is just a type of energy.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.153
Thomas Edison found a way to make it,
so why can’t we?

04:40.029 --> 04:42.156
-Mooshu, no!
-Oh no, I can’t watch.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.910
Mooshu, we needed those.

04:45.994 --> 04:50.456
New Rosie Rule number… 2,301.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.835
Always carry more balloons
than you think you need.

04:53.918 --> 04:58.172
I guess we’ll have to come up
with another way to create electricity,

04:58.256 --> 04:59.549
which means we need…

04:59.632 --> 05:01.592
-A brainstorm!
-A brainstorm!

05:01.676 --> 05:04.345
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

05:04.429 --> 05:07.056
<i>Throw in every thought you had</i>
<i>No idea is ever bad</i>

05:07.140 --> 05:09.934
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

05:10.018 --> 05:12.812
<i>Gather up your friends</i>
<i>Try to find the how, the what, the why</i>

05:12.895 --> 05:15.440
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

05:15.523 --> 05:20.236
<i>Let our imaginations</i>
<i>Become great new creations</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:24.198
<i>When we brainstorm, brainstorm</i>
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

05:24.282 --> 05:25.283
<i>Hey!</i>

05:26.284 --> 05:27.535
I have an idea.

05:27.618 --> 05:31.581
What if we use electric eels?

05:31.664 --> 05:34.876
We can design an eel tank
that will power the TV.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.210
Great idea!

05:36.294 --> 05:40.298
But finding electric eels this late
might be hard.

05:41.799 --> 05:45.762
What if we send a signal into space
to ask the aliens for help?

05:45.845 --> 05:48.973
I bet they can make electricity
with their minds!

05:49.557 --> 05:51.559
Calling all aliens!

05:55.563 --> 05:58.816
What if they’re busy with their own
movie night? We shouldn’t interrupt.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.734
Sorry!

06:00.860 --> 06:04.155
Let’s think. How is electricity made?

06:04.697 --> 06:09.952
Right! Machines make electricity
out of natural energy.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.245
Like wind.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.164
-Or the sun.
-Or rivers.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.082
Exactly!

06:14.165 --> 06:18.127
We can build a machine to turn
that kind of energy into electricity.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.256
-Well, it’s not very windy tonight.
-Or sunny.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.009
-And I don’t see any rivers.
-True.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.721
Mooshu!

06:31.516 --> 06:33.518
Wait. What about Mooshu?

06:34.602 --> 06:38.439
We can make a machine that turns
Mooshu’s energy into electricity.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.650
We could call it the Mooshinator.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.404
Great idea! Then this night
can get back to being perfect.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.201
Let’s grab some supplies.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.214
I think we did it.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.549
-Cool.
-Awesome!

07:04.632 --> 07:07.635
Arthur, will you do the honours
and place Mooshu in the wheel?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.347
Okay, Mooshu. Time to run.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.892
Mooshu, for the machine to work,

07:14.976 --> 07:18.104
you have to make the wheel spin
using your energy.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.857
That means you have to run. Like this!

07:23.568 --> 07:28.030
I have a theory. If you want to talk
to a cat, you have to talk like a cat.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.583
Okay. I don’t think she wants to run.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.670
If we can’t use the Mooshinator
to create electricity,

07:42.753 --> 07:45.548
how are we going to watch
<i>Snuggle Warriors 3?</i>

07:46.674 --> 07:49.427
Please say you found the backup generator.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.554
No. Sorry, baby.

07:52.346 --> 07:55.141
This movie night
is the opposite of perfect.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.392
Oh, chin up.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.271
We may not have found the generator,
but I did find something even better.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.772
My old guitar!

08:02.648 --> 08:05.109
That won’t help
get the electricity back on.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.529
No, but it will help us have fun
without electricity.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.198
Let’s dance!

08:11.282 --> 08:13.326
Yeah, it’s boogie time!

08:13.409 --> 08:16.704
Come on, honey.
We always love dancing together.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.999
I don’t want to dance.
I want to watch our movie.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.423
Okay, I’ll dance.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.966
Just for a second.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.427
Hey, everyone,
check out my new tennis dance!

08:33.262 --> 08:36.516
-Booyah!
-Who wants to try the Bigfoot Stomp?

08:36.599 --> 08:39.477
Stomp to the left!
Now stomp to the right! Yeah!

08:41.020 --> 08:43.648
It’s kind of like
my special bedtime dance.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.110
When I stay at my mum’s,
we do this dance before bed.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.571
It helps me get out all my energy.

08:50.655 --> 08:54.659
Energy. Of course!
You need energy to dance.

08:54.742 --> 08:58.579
Maybe there’s a way to use that energy
to power the TV.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.957
Got to get to the lab.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.005
That bedtime dance
does get your energy out.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.465
-Yes, it does.
-I’m done.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.803
Yeah. My mum has some pretty good ideas.
What’s your dance, Ada?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.721
Wait. Where’s Ada?

09:16.305 --> 09:17.348
Loading the lab.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.609
Maybe I can make a special dance floor

09:28.693 --> 09:31.279
to turn the energy of the dancers
into electricity.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.155
-Found her!
-There you are.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.701
Lab voices, please. Scientist at work.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.744
Oh. Found her!

09:38.828 --> 09:39.912
There you are.

09:39.996 --> 09:44.417
-Baby, why are you all alone in your room?
-Didn’t you have fun dancing, sweetie?

09:44.500 --> 09:47.086
I did, but I have to find a way
to make electricity

09:47.169 --> 09:49.130
so we can have the perfect movie night.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.674
I think it’s a little too late
to start the movie.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.051
We wouldn’t finish it before bedtime.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.389
My first-ever movie night
is a gigantic failure.

09:58.472 --> 10:01.517
Failure? No way! Tonight was so much fun.

10:01.601 --> 10:05.479
Yeah! It was the most spectabulous
movie night I’ve ever been to!

10:05.563 --> 10:06.897
Really?

10:06.981 --> 10:09.025
-Definitely!
-Yeah, for sure!

10:09.108 --> 10:11.444
Tonight may not have gone
the way you planned,

10:11.527 --> 10:13.321
but that doesn’t mean you failed.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.949
We did discover
several ways not to make electricity.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.577
Yeah, just like Thomas Edison, remember?

10:19.660 --> 10:25.541
Before he succeeded, he found
9,999 ways not to make a light bulb.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.835
You’re right. He did.

10:27.918 --> 10:32.006
Then sounds to me
like tonight was a scientific success.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.675
I guess it was. Thanks, everyone.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.471
I just wish I wasn’t so focused
on getting the power back on.

10:38.554 --> 10:44.602
-I would’ve enjoyed the fun stuff more.
-Well, it’s not our bedtime yet.

10:44.685 --> 10:48.022
Which means
there’s still time for more dancing!

10:52.485 --> 10:54.236
Everybody, follow my lead.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.030
Do the Scientist Shuffle!

10:56.113 --> 11:00.826
<i>Put on your gloves and clap three times</i>
<i>Shake the beaker and do a little slide</i>

11:00.910 --> 11:01.994
Now all together!

11:02.078 --> 11:04.080
-Yeah!
-Oh yeah!

11:04.163 --> 11:06.082
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

11:06.999 --> 11:08.209
The power’s back on!

11:09.752 --> 11:11.504
But we don’t need it.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.841
-Okay, let’s dance.
-Yeah!

11:15.925 --> 11:17.134
Yeah!

11:20.096 --> 11:24.183
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

11:32.441 --> 11:36.028
Hello, I’m Sarah Kurtz.
I’m a solar energy researcher.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.364
I’m enjoying the sunshine today,

11:38.447 --> 11:42.743
but I’ve spent my whole life studying
how to use the energy from the sun

11:42.827 --> 11:45.496
to generate electricity with solar panels.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.622
<i>Let’s go!</i>

11:46.706 --> 11:49.875
So, everything needs energy
to be able to function.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.128
Your computer needs electricity,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.755
which is a form of energy,
in order to work.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.426
Now, in the case of sunshine,
sunshine is a form of energy.

11:58.509 --> 12:03.681
So the sunshine comes down
and strikes the front of the solar panel,

12:03.764 --> 12:07.435
and the solar cells, that are black,
absorb that sunshine

12:07.518 --> 12:09.270
and turn it into electricity.

12:09.353 --> 12:12.148
The electricity
then flows through the wire,

12:12.231 --> 12:15.818
and that wire
comes out of the back of the solar panel

12:15.901 --> 12:20.114
and you can see then that this wire
goes back and into the building.

12:21.449 --> 12:25.661
And then those wires
come over to our measurement system here.

12:25.745 --> 12:31.167
Now, if these were at your house,
those wires would come into a special box

12:31.250 --> 12:34.378
that connects to the electrical system
in your house

12:34.462 --> 12:38.215
so that you could use that electricity
to run your TV

12:38.299 --> 12:40.509
or whatever it is that you’re using.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.473
You’ll see energy everywhere around you
being used.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.434
It gives us the power
to do what we want to do.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.060
<i>Cool!</i>

12:50.144 --> 12:51.312
Fun fact!

12:51.395 --> 12:54.774
Today, you can find solar panels
almost anywhere.

12:54.857 --> 12:59.069
You can buy them on a backpack,
on a hat, or even on your car.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.949
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!

13:09.371 --> 13:11.332
Coming in for landing, over.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.833
Roger that, over.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.253
Obstacle. Dive!

13:16.337 --> 13:17.171
Oh no!

13:17.671 --> 13:18.964
Iggy, are you all right?

13:19.048 --> 13:21.008
It’s okay. Everybody falls sometimes.

13:21.091 --> 13:24.345
Hey, where are all these bananas
coming from?

13:24.428 --> 13:26.722
Looks like
they’re coming from the kitchen.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.099
Maybe a giant banana tree’s
growing in there.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.937
Or a banana food fight outside
got bananas inside.

13:34.063 --> 13:34.897
Mum?

13:37.399 --> 13:40.861
-Oh my gosh, Mum, your thumbs!
-I’m fine, sweetie.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.490
I just burnt them a teeny bit while
I was preheating the oven. No biggie.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.950
Preheating the oven?

13:46.033 --> 13:47.201
Wait a sec.

13:47.284 --> 13:50.454
Flour? Sugar? Bananas!

13:50.538 --> 13:54.166
You’re baking banana bread!
Great Aunt Rose must be coming!

13:54.250 --> 13:56.335
Coming in for a happy landing!

13:57.586 --> 13:59.839
Great Aunt Rose. No way!

13:59.922 --> 14:04.134
Yep. I have a last-minute flight tonight.
Good thing Aunt Rose loves watching Rosie.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.763
All she ever asks for in return
is my banana bread.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.431
Thank your dad again for me, Iggy.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.269
I will. I love that you’re baking
with bananas from my dad’s tree.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.855
Here’s Great Aunt Rose
with the flyers she built.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.898
That’s what they called planes back then.

14:17.982 --> 14:22.111
Here’s Piper, and Queen Ava.
Oh, and Old Sam.

14:22.194 --> 14:26.615
She made some fabulous flops too.
Like Fab Flora.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.742
It’s like an aeroplane museum.

14:28.826 --> 14:32.037
These old plane designs
are the bee’s knees.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.916
-That’s what they’d say back then, right?
-Righto, Iggy-o!

14:36.917 --> 14:41.297
Okay, Aunt Rose will be here soon,
and these bananas need to be peeled.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.133
But it’s okay.
I just have to work the problem.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.594
Try different ways until one works.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.221
Work the problem. I like that.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.599
Great Aunt Rose always says that.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.185
These blasted bananas!

14:56.812 --> 15:00.941
Guys, I know we had play plans,
but I really wanna help my mum.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.401
-I’ll help!
-Me too!

15:02.484 --> 15:04.945
Thanks! Hey, Mum, we can help you.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.363
That’s sweet, pudding.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.866
But I’ve got everything under control.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.659
Get back here!

15:11.285 --> 15:12.786
We’ll peel.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.748
But I can’t leave you all alone.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.333
You, go get ready.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.503
I am running late.
Okay, thanks, my little co-pilot.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.255
Or should I say co-pilots?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.677
Okay, where do we start?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.596
With peeling?

15:30.679 --> 15:33.432
What if we find a way
to help my mum peel bananas

15:33.515 --> 15:35.809
not just today but every day?

15:35.893 --> 15:38.103
You and your mum
must eat a lot of bananas.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.897
Actually, we do.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.192
Banana bread, banana pudding,
baked honey bananas--

15:43.275 --> 15:47.196
That’s so many bananas. It’s… bananas!

15:47.279 --> 15:50.407
Our need to peel is real.
Let’s brainstorm.

15:50.491 --> 15:55.120
Got it. Ninjas! I bet they’d slice
and dice bananas like pros.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.248
But ninjas might like fighting
more than peeling.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.625
Oh yeah. They might.

15:59.708 --> 16:04.755
I know. Maybe we could build
a banana-peeling factory.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.466
I’d guesstimate that would take about…

16:07.549 --> 16:09.969
Carry the one, add the two…

16:10.052 --> 16:11.679
262 days.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.223
-Give or take.
-That’s way too long.

16:14.306 --> 16:19.603
But what if we take
Rosie’s ninja banana peelers,

16:19.687 --> 16:21.647
and Iggy’s factory idea,

16:21.730 --> 16:24.984
and put them together
to make a banana-peeling machine?

16:25.067 --> 16:27.569
No ninjas and a lot smaller.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.529
-Yes!
-Love it!

16:28.612 --> 16:30.990
-I’ll design it.
-And I’ll build it, of course.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.206
And… done! What do you think?

16:39.289 --> 16:42.751
-Perfect.
-Fab-tastic! Now do I get to build things?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.086
-Yep!
-Yeehah!

16:44.169 --> 16:45.629
Loading the lab.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.228
Screwdriver.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.272
Wrench.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.190
-Rubber ducky.
-Huh?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.818
Trust me. It’ll add padding.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.987
Plus… cute.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.780
And… there.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.116
How’s the banana-peeling coming, crew?

17:14.199 --> 17:19.371
Presenting the future of banana peeling.

17:19.455 --> 17:23.125
The Banana-Rama 1,0!

17:24.001 --> 17:28.589
I thought you three
were in here peeling bananas by hand.

17:28.672 --> 17:34.094
I should’ve known you would’ve built
a lean, mean, peeling machine.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.472
Allow us to demonstrate.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.516
Banana peeler trial one. Go!

17:41.643 --> 17:42.811
Here they come.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.648
Here they go.

17:47.649 --> 17:48.692
They’re holey.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.818
Holy moly!

17:50.319 --> 17:51.779
Oh, phooey!

17:51.862 --> 17:55.199
It’s okay.
We can always just peel with our hands.

17:55.282 --> 17:59.578
No, we’ve got this.
You go finish getting ready.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.915
Roger that,
Captain Bananas Smooches and Cream.

18:03.957 --> 18:07.211
Maybe the machine
just needs a little love tap.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.797
My mum gives them to the car all the time.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.509
-Whoa!
-Yikes!

18:14.218 --> 18:15.886
I’ll go press the button.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.224
-Careful!
-Go, Ada!

18:23.852 --> 18:25.771
That was bananas.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.315
In the coolest way.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.526
Good thing we can reuse all these bananas.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.612
-Is everything all right?
-Everything’s groovy, Mum.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.156
Nothing’s wrong. No bananas to see here.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.242
Just scientists at work.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.119
Okay.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.332
I think I see the problem.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.043
Forks.
There’s a pizza cutter in the drawer.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.837
-Can you get it?
-Sure.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.132
Nice.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.093
Okay, that should do the trick.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.638
Let’s try this again,
and get these bananas in the machine.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.855
-Why aren’t they coming out?
-Weird.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.898
Let me take a look.

19:11.900 --> 19:15.237
Oh man. I got banana’d.

19:16.697 --> 19:20.284
Okay. We can fix this.
We just need a little bit more time.

19:20.367 --> 19:23.245
Great Aunt Rose just texted.
She’s on her way.

19:23.328 --> 19:27.040
No! She can’t come yet.
We have no bananas peeled.

19:27.124 --> 19:31.753
Hey, I’m sure Aunt Rose’ll understand
if there’s no banana bread this time.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.339
Chin up.
I’m gonna go finish getting ready.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.177
This was just a floppity-flop-flop-flop!

19:39.511 --> 19:41.096
Maybe we should just give up.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.222
<i>I give up</i>

19:43.473 --> 19:45.517
<i>I can’t do it, gonna quit</i>

19:46.643 --> 19:48.145
<i>Can’t get through it, hit a wall</i>

19:48.228 --> 19:50.814
<i>It’s so impossible</i>
<i>When all I see are obstacles</i>

19:50.898 --> 19:53.150
<i>Afraid I’m gonna fail and so I quit</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:56.320
<i>There’s no use in trying</i>

19:56.403 --> 20:00.866
<i>There’s no way that we can win</i>

20:00.949 --> 20:02.492
<i>Don’t give up</i>

20:02.576 --> 20:04.077
<i>Don’t give in</i>

20:04.161 --> 20:07.456
<i>Gotta get right back up and try again</i>

20:07.539 --> 20:10.125
<i>Mistakes can be lucky breaks</i>

20:10.209 --> 20:13.295
<i>A happy accident along the way</i>

20:13.378 --> 20:14.796
<i>Don’t give up</i>

20:14.880 --> 20:16.632
<i>Don’t give in</i>

20:16.715 --> 20:19.927
<i>Maybe you’ll make failure your best friend</i>

20:20.010 --> 20:22.554
<i>And try, try, try</i>

20:22.638 --> 20:27.059
<i>Gotta get up and try again</i>

20:29.686 --> 20:31.688
You’re right. I gotta try again.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.567
We’ll work this problem
like your Great Aunt Rose always says.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.819
Let’s examine these bananas.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.908
Rosie!
I think I just connected the polka dots.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.535
Notice anything about the bananas?

20:45.619 --> 20:50.457
That one’s the colour of a canary,
and that one looks like a bumblebee.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.459
Look closer.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.127
The tops.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.213
None of them are even touched.

20:56.296 --> 21:00.717
Yep, because starting to peel a banana
is the hardest part.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.971
That’s what the machine is missing.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.224
A banana-peeler-starter!

21:07.766 --> 21:09.726
We can fix it!

21:10.227 --> 21:15.023
-And that should do it. Mum!
-Everything okay?

21:15.107 --> 21:21.405
Yep. Presenting the Banana-Rama 3,0!

21:21.488 --> 21:23.323
Bananas on the belt, please.

21:31.248 --> 21:35.502
You did it! You made
a lean, mean, banana-peeling machine.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.045
Great job, crew.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.130
Yeah!

21:39.423 --> 21:43.552
Look at all these bananas!
I’m gonna have a lot of fertiliser.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.637
Bananas. Sugar.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.806
Smooches.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.642
That makes it extra sweet.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.440
Banana bread’s done!

21:57.566 --> 21:58.608
She’s here!

22:01.028 --> 22:04.614
Great Aunt Rose
reporting for Rosie-sitting duty.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.869
Ada! Iggy! Get in here.

22:08.952 --> 22:13.165
-Hi, Great Aunt Rose.
-Hello, Mrs Rosie’s Great Aunt Rose.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.586
Banana bread!

22:17.669 --> 22:21.256
Yep. And we made a banana-peeling machine.

22:21.340 --> 22:25.677
We call it the Banana-Rama 3,0.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.351
I’m very impressed.

22:33.268 --> 22:36.480
Thanks.
We worked the problem and didn’t quit.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.483
-Just like I taught you.
-Well, I’m off to work.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.902
Wait a sec. You forgot something.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.445
Much better.

22:47.240 --> 22:52.204
Thank you to my little co-pilot
and her amazing flight crew.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.288
I mean, friends.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.999
-You’re welcome.
-Just doing what scientists do.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.042
Have fun, crew!

22:57.125 --> 22:58.960
-Thanks. Bye.
-Bye!

22:59.044 --> 23:01.797
You know what else they do?
Test their products.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.715
Let’s test this bread.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.884
You don’t have to tell me twice.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.806
Now that we’ve fuelled up
with banana in our bellies,

23:10.889 --> 23:12.933
let’s fly, crew!

23:13.600 --> 23:15.602
Coming in for a landing, over.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.687
Roger that. Over.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.106
-Yay!
-Yeah!

23:24.236 --> 23:28.323
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.832
Hi, I’m James Finley
and I’m a biomedical engineer.

23:36.915 --> 23:41.420
I use engineering
to understand how people move

23:41.503 --> 23:44.589
and to help people
recovering from injuries.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.757
<i>Let’s go!</i>

23:45.841 --> 23:49.845
Today, we’re going to talk about
how we develop virtual reality games

23:49.928 --> 23:51.930
to improve rehabilitation.

23:52.848 --> 23:57.894
Sometimes, you may have an injury
that damages or hurts one of your muscles,

23:57.978 --> 24:01.523
and, over time,
your body has to fix that muscle.

24:01.606 --> 24:06.945
So rehabilitation is really about
getting back to the things you love to do.

24:11.783 --> 24:15.328
This head-mounted display
is something you wear over your eyes,

24:15.412 --> 24:20.167
and we can control this
so that you see a virtual environment.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.252
Here we go.

24:25.589 --> 24:30.010
This game we designed so that it helps
people to move around in the space

24:30.093 --> 24:33.305
and they have to be able
to grab the letters.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.517
We can make rehabilitation a lot more fun,

24:37.601 --> 24:41.354
and we can get them
to do really active movements

24:41.438 --> 24:45.275
that will help them
improve their mobility in the world.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.360
Just beat level two.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.821
Fun fact!

24:50.530 --> 24:54.201
One of the earliest uses
of virtual reality for training

24:54.284 --> 24:58.371
was to help pilots learn how to fly planes
using flight simulators.

24:59.789 --> 25:02.959
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!
