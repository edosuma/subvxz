01:39.616 --> 01:41.618
Anybody home?

01:41.618 --> 01:44.621
Hello?

01:54.631 --> 01:56.633
What's this?

01:56.633 --> 01:58.134
What's this?

02:09.645 --> 02:12.148
Oh, my god,
tony...

02:13.149 --> 02:15.151
here, allow me.

02:21.157 --> 02:23.660
Happy birthday.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.669
Oohhh...

02:35.672 --> 02:36.673
oops.

02:40.677 --> 02:42.178
What?

02:42.178 --> 02:44.681
Look at the ring
your father gave me.

02:44.681 --> 02:46.182
I already saw it.

02:46.182 --> 02:48.184
I was gonna
wrap it, but,

02:48.184 --> 02:50.687
it's wasteful
to the environment.

02:50.687 --> 02:52.689
Thank you,
young man.

02:56.693 --> 02:58.695
"The matrix".

02:58.695 --> 02:59.696
I haven't
seen it yet.

03:01.698 --> 03:03.700
Hello?

03:03.700 --> 03:05.702
Happy birthday,
mama.

03:06.202 --> 03:07.203
What are you
doing here?

03:07.203 --> 03:08.705
Don't you have
an exam tomorrow?

03:08.705 --> 03:10.206
Nice to see you, too.

03:10.206 --> 03:11.207
I'm sorry, honey.

03:11.207 --> 03:13.710
I'm just surprised
to see you.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.712
See what your
father got me?

03:15.712 --> 03:16.713
Mmm.

03:18.214 --> 03:19.716
Big ring.

03:22.218 --> 03:23.720
Happy birthday.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.723
Oh, my god,
so many gifts.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.725
"A day of beauty
and pampering

03:29.225 --> 03:31.227
at the belladonna
day spa."

03:31.227 --> 03:33.730
It's in soho,
my friend batshe
va says it's awesome.

03:33.730 --> 03:35.732
Massage,
mud treatment,
everything.

03:36.232 --> 03:38.735
I got myself one,
so we can go together.

03:39.235 --> 03:40.737
I put it on
your credit card.

03:43.239 --> 03:45.742
12 years, i took
this club from nothin'!

03:45.742 --> 03:47.243
Give him
a drink.

03:47.243 --> 03:48.745
What do you
drink, rocco?

03:48.745 --> 03:50.246
Johnny black.

03:50.246 --> 03:52.749
This place was
a shit hole when
i took it over.

03:52.749 --> 03:54.250
You could use
a little help,

03:54.250 --> 03:56.753
make this place in
the 21st century.

03:56.753 --> 03:59.756
Yeah, it's like
permanently 1987 in here.

03:59.756 --> 04:01.758
Goddamn vikings!

04:01.758 --> 04:04.260
Nobody misse
s the extra point.

04:04.260 --> 04:07.263
That's all they had to
do, one little kick,
and now i'm ruined!

04:10.767 --> 04:12.268
Don't bitch to me!

04:12.268 --> 04:15.271
Bet with your head,
not over it!

04:16.773 --> 04:18.274
You still a partner.

04:18.274 --> 04:20.276
You got a problem
with us?

04:20.276 --> 04:22.779
One, two, three!

04:26.282 --> 04:27.784
I'll get it.

04:27.784 --> 04:30.787
Did you invite some
stray dog up here?

04:30.787 --> 04:31.788
You short
of food?

04:33.289 --> 04:34.791
Sorry i'm late.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.794
We didn't even know
you were comin'.

04:37.794 --> 04:39.796
Meadow told me it was
carmela's birthday.

04:40.296 --> 04:41.798
It is so nice
of you to join us.

04:42.298 --> 04:44.300
Hi, mr. And
mrs. Deangelis.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.802
Jackie.

04:45.802 --> 04:47.303
Hey.

04:47.303 --> 04:48.304
Have you heard
the good news?

04:48.304 --> 04:50.306
We met thanksgiving?

04:54.310 --> 04:55.812
Happy birthday,
carm'.

04:55.812 --> 04:57.313
Oh, jackie,
you didn't have to.

04:57.313 --> 04:58.815
I'll put it on ice
in a minute.

04:58.815 --> 05:00.316
Thank you, sir.

05:00.316 --> 05:02.318
Alright, come
on, let's go,

05:02.318 --> 05:03.820
the wax is
melting here.

05:25.341 --> 05:27.844
I heard you got made
defensive captain.

05:27.844 --> 05:29.846
Yeah, five and
a half sacks

05:30.346 --> 05:31.347
and two
recovered fumbles,

05:31.347 --> 05:32.849
almost sco
red a touchdown
on one of'em.

05:32.849 --> 05:34.350
Excellent, man.

05:34.350 --> 05:35.852
You know i played
linebacker for boonton?

05:35.852 --> 05:37.353
Senior year,
i was all- county.

05:37.353 --> 05:38.354
Wow.

05:38.354 --> 05:39.856
Maybe we could work
out a little together.

05:40.356 --> 05:42.358
Sure, you should come
to the blessed sac
game on tuesday.

05:42.358 --> 05:44.360
It's the last game
of the season.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.361
We were supposed to
play last month,

05:45.862 --> 05:46.863
but, the r
efs were on strike.

05:46.863 --> 05:47.864
I'll be there.

05:48.364 --> 05:49.866
I wanna come to.

05:49.866 --> 05:51.868
My little brother's
football game.

05:52.869 --> 05:54.370
No champagne,
the good lord

05:54.871 --> 05:55.872
doesn't want us
to drink alcohol.

05:56.372 --> 05:57.373
Didn't jesus
drink wine?

05:57.373 --> 05:59.876
He was jesus, ton',
we can't make comparisons.

06:05.381 --> 06:07.383
Who invented
these things?

06:07.383 --> 06:08.885
You people are all
out of your minds.

06:08.885 --> 06:10.887
Mom, is it alright
if i sleep at egon's

06:10.887 --> 06:12.388
if i promise to
be in bed by one?

06:12.388 --> 06:13.890
I ordered one for
you so you don't disappear

06:13.890 --> 06:15.892
when i send you
to the market.

06:15.892 --> 06:17.894
Lights out by one,
in bed by 12.

06:35.912 --> 06:37.914
Be careful.

06:41.918 --> 06:43.920
I smell fish.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.421
We're near
the ocean.

06:50.927 --> 06:53.429
Now i smell piss.

07:04.941 --> 07:06.442
What?

07:06.442 --> 07:07.944
It's yours.

07:08.444 --> 07:09.445
What is?

07:09.445 --> 07:11.447
This is the lollipop
in long branch.

07:11.447 --> 07:12.949
This is your club.

07:14.450 --> 07:17.453
I'm a partner here
now, me and furio.

07:17.954 --> 07:18.955
But, we're gonna
be silent.

07:19.455 --> 07:20.957
You're gonna be
the owner- manager.

07:21.457 --> 07:23.960
You book the bands,
you find the talent,

07:23.960 --> 07:25.461
whatever
you wanna do.

07:25.461 --> 07:26.462
It's yours.

07:28.464 --> 07:30.967
Oh, my god!

07:30.967 --> 07:33.970
I can't
believe it!

07:36.472 --> 07:38.975
You're gonna
turn this place

07:38.975 --> 07:40.476
into the biggest
jersey club

07:40.476 --> 07:41.978
since "the stone pony".

07:43.980 --> 07:45.982
Thank you,
christopher!

07:45.982 --> 07:47.483
I'm so excited.

07:51.988 --> 07:53.489
Can we change
the name?

07:53.990 --> 07:55.992
Whatever y
ou want, baby.

07:56.993 --> 07:59.495
This is rocc
o, he works for you.

08:14.010 --> 08:16.012
The ring looks
beautiful on you.

08:16.012 --> 08:19.015
It is gorgeous.

08:20.516 --> 08:23.019
Tony, is there anything
you need to tell me?

08:23.019 --> 08:24.020
About the ring?

08:24.520 --> 08:26.022
I don't know.

08:26.022 --> 08:29.025
You didn't buy that little
car you were talking about.

08:29.025 --> 08:30.526
The mercedes?

08:30.526 --> 08:33.529
I'd look like a douchebag
in one of those.

08:33.529 --> 08:35.530
Jean cusamano calls
those sports cars

08:35.530 --> 08:37.033
mid- life crisis
mobiles.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.034
What the fuck
does she know?

08:44.540 --> 08:47.543
Is this 17- 26
pearl ave.?

08:47.543 --> 08:49.045
No.

08:49.045 --> 08:52.548
Is there a pearl a
ve. In this neighborhood?

08:56.052 --> 08:57.553
Hello?

08:58.054 --> 09:00.056
Hey, ro.

09:00.056 --> 09:02.558
No, jackie took
meadow to the movies.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.562
They said,
"not late".

09:06.562 --> 09:08.564
Alright.

09:08.564 --> 09:10.066
Bye.

09:18.574 --> 09:21.077
What?

09:21.077 --> 09:23.079
I don't know.

09:23.079 --> 09:24.580
I'm not thrilled
about this thing

09:24.580 --> 09:26.582
with jackie and meadow.

09:26.582 --> 09:29.085
I think she came home
and he came over,

09:29.085 --> 09:30.586
so that they could
go out tonight.

09:30.586 --> 09:32.588
So, what?
He's a good kid.

09:32.588 --> 09:34.590
He comes from
good stock.

09:34.590 --> 09:36.092
He's been on his
best behavior lately,

09:36.092 --> 09:37.593
i can't deny that.

09:37.593 --> 09:39.595
I just never pictured meadow
with someone like him.

09:39.595 --> 09:43.099
"Someone like him"?
He's one of us.

09:43.099 --> 09:46.602
Don't tell me you
were happier when she
was going with that

09:46.602 --> 09:49.605
jamal ginsberg,
the hasidic homeboy.

09:49.605 --> 09:53.609
We scraped through that
by the skin of our ass.

09:54.110 --> 09:56.612
I just don't want her
to miss the opportunities

09:57.113 --> 09:58.614
that are
available to her.

09:59.115 --> 10:01.617
She should be at
the museum of modern
art in her free time,

10:02.118 --> 10:05.121
not watching t
v at rosalie aprile's.

10:05.121 --> 10:07.123
You'd rather have her
looking at pictures
of soup cans,

10:07.123 --> 10:09.125
instead of being
close to home?

10:09.125 --> 10:11.127
I don't know.

10:11.127 --> 10:13.129
You talk to her,

10:13.129 --> 10:15.131
and i'll talk
to jackie jr.

10:17.633 --> 10:19.635
Here's your edgar
allen poe paper.

10:19.635 --> 10:21.637
You did it
already?

10:21.637 --> 10:23.139
No problem.

10:23.139 --> 10:25.141
Thanks.

10:25.141 --> 10:27.143
I would have
done it myself,

10:27.643 --> 10:29.145
i was gonna do it,

10:29.645 --> 10:32.148
i just couldn't ge
t through the books.

10:32.148 --> 10:35.151
I never should've took
literature of obsession.

10:35.151 --> 10:38.154
I owe you big time.

10:38.154 --> 10:39.655
Thanks.

10:46.662 --> 10:49.665
How can i
repay you?

10:49.665 --> 10:51.667
I don't know.

10:51.667 --> 10:54.170
Why don't you
surprise me?

10:54.170 --> 10:58.174
On your ma
rk, get set, go!

11:09.185 --> 11:10.686
I kicked
your asses!

11:10.686 --> 11:11.687
You cheat!

11:11.687 --> 11:13.189
Ow, my eyes...

11:17.193 --> 11:18.694
there's too
much chlorine.

11:19.195 --> 11:20.696
I think i swallowed
some water.

11:20.696 --> 11:21.697
You girls see me
out there?

11:22.198 --> 11:23.699
Yeah, it looked
like you were
cheating.

11:23.699 --> 11:26.202
Hey, guys!

11:26.202 --> 11:27.703
We got
mr. Goodwi
n's office open!

11:27.703 --> 11:29.205
Check it out.

11:36.712 --> 11:38.214
Let's go for it.

11:50.726 --> 11:52.728
Hey, everybody!

11:54.730 --> 11:56.732
Boo- ya!

12:03.239 --> 12:07.243
C'mon, let's
go, c'mon!

12:07.243 --> 12:09.245
Don't cut
your feet!

12:12.248 --> 12:14.750
Hey, it's sunday morni
ng and you're listening...

12:14.750 --> 12:16.252
good morning.

12:16.252 --> 12:17.753
Hello.
'Morning.

12:17.753 --> 12:20.256
Did jackie call?

12:20.256 --> 12:22.758
Vince lombardi's out
back with your brother.

12:40.276 --> 12:43.779
So, i've been
thinking about a car.

12:43.779 --> 12:46.282
I knew i was gonna
get hit up

12:46.282 --> 12:47.783
for someth
ing on this trip.

12:47.783 --> 12:49.285
What, you can spend
thousands on sapphires

12:49.285 --> 12:51.787
but, a hardworking
student has to take
the bus everywhere?

12:51.787 --> 12:53.289
You live a block
from the school.

12:53.289 --> 12:54.790
What do you need
a car for?

12:54.790 --> 12:56.292
It'd be nice to hop
in a car after class

12:56.292 --> 12:58.294
and come have
dinner with you
guys once in a while.

12:58.294 --> 13:02.298
They steal cars
left and right
in new york,

13:02.298 --> 13:04.300
parking is
impossible.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.302
Besides, the bus
gets you here
in 45 minutes.

13:06.302 --> 13:07.803
I'm not asking
for anything fancy,

13:08.304 --> 13:09.305
just something
to get me around.

13:09.305 --> 13:11.807
You could've had
a car last year,

13:11.807 --> 13:12.808
but you spurne
d your nose at it.

13:12.808 --> 13:14.310
Eric's car? Is
that a sick joke?

13:14.310 --> 13:16.812
It may interest you to
know that his father's

13:16.812 --> 13:18.814
now in a mental health
facility in nevada.

13:18.814 --> 13:21.817
Why don't you just
wait and see how
this semester goes?

13:21.817 --> 13:23.819
You were just complaining
about how much work
you had to do!

13:23.819 --> 13:25.321
Don't you think you should
concentrate on that?

13:25.821 --> 13:27.323
I am concentrating
on that!

13:27.323 --> 13:28.824
What do you
think i am?

13:28.824 --> 13:30.326
Jesus christ, you're
like a broken record!

13:30.326 --> 13:32.328
Take it down a notch! Hey!

13:32.828 --> 13:33.829
God.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.831
We just want to make sur
e that you take advantage

13:35.831 --> 13:37.333
of all the city
has to offer you.

13:37.833 --> 13:41.837
Culturally, socially,
educationally.

13:46.342 --> 13:48.844
Right before the
snap, the ball
isn't doing anything.

13:49.345 --> 13:51.847
But the qb's eyes
can tell you whether

13:51.847 --> 13:54.350
he's gonna drop back
to pass or hand it off.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.852
It happens in
a split second,

13:56.852 --> 13:58.354
but, over the course
of the game,

13:58.354 --> 13:59.855
you can learn
what his habits are,

14:00.356 --> 14:01.857
and once you know
these habits,

14:01.857 --> 14:03.359
he's fucked.

14:03.359 --> 14:05.361
Hey.

14:05.361 --> 14:07.363
Good morning.

14:07.363 --> 14:09.365
Okay, a. J. , tr
y what i told you.

14:09.365 --> 14:11.867
I will,
thanks, jackie.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.882
The wall
of pride...

14:26.882 --> 14:29.385
what kind
of animals?

14:29.885 --> 14:30.886
I don't think
they stole anything.

14:31.387 --> 14:34.390
They just did a number
on the place.

14:34.390 --> 14:36.392
They left this.

14:55.411 --> 14:56.912
You make
this pizza?

14:57.413 --> 14:59.915
Who make
this pizza?

14:59.915 --> 15:00.916
We're asking you.

15:00.916 --> 15:02.918
This your
store logo, sir?

15:04.420 --> 15:05.921
That's my box.

15:05.921 --> 15:07.923
This pie was found
at a crime scene.

15:07.923 --> 15:09.425
My pizza never
hurt nobody.

15:09.425 --> 15:10.426
Come again, sir?

15:10.426 --> 15:11.927
You no find any
bacteria in here.

15:12.428 --> 15:13.929
Some kids broke into
verbum dei high school,

15:13.929 --> 15:15.431
broke things,
they left this there.

15:15.931 --> 15:16.932
You tell me
their names,

15:16.932 --> 15:18.434
i'll go put my foo
t up their ass!

15:18.434 --> 15:20.436
I got it, pop.

15:21.437 --> 15:22.438
That's a custom job.

15:22.438 --> 15:23.939
How's that, sir?

15:23.939 --> 15:25.441
Double meatball,
pepperoni, sausage,

15:25.441 --> 15:28.444
peppers, onions,
extra mozzarella.

15:28.444 --> 15:29.445
This pie
fit a pattern?

15:29.445 --> 15:30.946
Come again,
officer?

15:30.946 --> 15:32.448
Any customers
order this combo
on a regular basis?

15:32.948 --> 15:33.949
Only one i know.
Who's that?

15:34.450 --> 15:35.451
I'd rather
not say.

15:35.451 --> 15:37.953
Tell me right now,
i find these bastards!

15:37.953 --> 15:40.456
Pop, go in the back,
make meatballs, go ahead.

15:40.956 --> 15:41.957
Sir.
Yes, officer?

15:41.957 --> 15:43.459
Word to the wi
what's that? Se.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.961
Technically, you're an
accessory after the fact.

15:45.961 --> 15:48.464
I cannot believe this!

15:48.464 --> 15:50.466
Do you know how
serious this is?

15:50.466 --> 15:52.968
Do you?

15:54.470 --> 15:56.972
Answer me, right now.

15:56.972 --> 15:57.973
Yes.

15:57.973 --> 15:58.974
Yes, what?

15:58.974 --> 16:00.476
I know
it's serious.

16:00.476 --> 16:01.977
So, why did
you do it?

16:01.977 --> 16:03.479
I don't know.

16:03.479 --> 16:04.980
Why did you do it?

16:04.980 --> 16:06.982
Do you hate
the school?

16:06.982 --> 16:09.485
Do you have a problem
with someone there
or something?

16:09.485 --> 16:10.486
Then, why? No.

16:10.486 --> 16:12.988
It just happened.

16:12.988 --> 16:14.990
We went in,
swimming as a goof.

16:14.990 --> 16:17.493
Someone threw
something in the pool.

16:17.493 --> 16:19.995
A couple of guys
started throwing stuff in.

16:20.996 --> 16:22.998
We just did it.

16:22.998 --> 16:25.000
And if they were jumping off
the george washington bridge,

16:25.501 --> 16:27.503
would you just
do that, too?

16:27.503 --> 16:28.504
No.

16:31.507 --> 16:33.509
What are you
doing here?

16:34.009 --> 16:36.512
Answer
your father.

16:36.512 --> 16:38.013
I got
sent home.

16:38.013 --> 16:39.515
Why?

16:41.016 --> 16:43.519
Why?

16:44.019 --> 16:46.522
I got in trouble.

16:46.522 --> 16:48.524
Your son, broke into
his school friday night

16:48.524 --> 16:50.526
and vandalized
the swimming pool.

16:51.026 --> 16:52.528
How do you vandali
ze the swimming pool?

16:52.528 --> 16:54.029
They threw a bunch
of stuff in it,

16:54.029 --> 16:55.531
they broke things.

16:55.531 --> 16:57.032
What'd you d
o that for?

16:57.032 --> 16:58.534
Screwin' around?

16:58.534 --> 17:00.035
On your mother's
birthday!

17:00.536 --> 17:03.539
It wasn't...it
was after midnight.

17:03.539 --> 17:05.540
What, are you
fuckin' stupid, huh?

17:05.540 --> 17:07.542
So, what now,
you're suspended?

17:07.542 --> 17:09.044
I don't know.

17:09.044 --> 17:10.546
Tony, do you know
how serious this is?

17:10.546 --> 17:11.547
He may be expelled.

17:11.547 --> 17:12.548
What'd they say?

17:12.548 --> 17:13.549
Nothing.

17:13.549 --> 17:15.050
They just
sent me home,

17:15.550 --> 17:17.051
and said to bring
you guys into the
principal's office.

17:17.051 --> 17:18.554
On your mother's
birthday.

17:21.557 --> 17:23.058
They're gonna
call you.

17:23.058 --> 17:25.560
Just when everythi
ng was going good, huh?

17:25.560 --> 17:28.063
You're gonna
miss the big game.

17:28.063 --> 17:30.566
You're screwin
' everything up.

17:30.566 --> 17:33.068
Your football career,
down the drain!

17:41.577 --> 17:42.578
There it is.

17:42.578 --> 17:44.079
What a
beautiful ring.

17:44.079 --> 17:45.080
I know.

17:45.581 --> 17:49.084
I want you ladies
to try this.

17:49.084 --> 17:50.586
Mozzarella a
nd string beans?

17:51.086 --> 17:53.088
I was gonna get
the hot antipast'.

17:53.088 --> 17:55.090
It's not mozzarella,
this is called buratta.

17:55.591 --> 17:56.592
I had it flown in
this morning,

17:56.592 --> 17:58.093
by fed ex,
from italy.

17:58.093 --> 18:00.596
It's a lot more
subtle and smooth
than mozzarella,

18:00.596 --> 18:02.097
with an almost,
nut- like flavor.

18:02.097 --> 18:03.098
Thank you,
artie.

18:03.098 --> 18:04.099
I'm not that
big on nuts.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.101
A little pepper?

18:06.101 --> 18:07.102
No pepper.

18:07.102 --> 18:09.605
'Carm, on your half?
It's all about the contrast.

18:09.605 --> 18:12.608
The crispness of the beans,
the smoothness of the cheese.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.109
Uh, no, i'm fine.

18:14.109 --> 18:16.111
Buon appetito.

18:20.616 --> 18:22.117
Tastes like mozzarella
and string beans.

18:22.618 --> 18:26.622
You have it, 'carm,
i want the hot antipast'.

18:26.622 --> 18:29.625
I'd like to
make a toast.

18:29.625 --> 18:33.629
To the blossoming friendship
between our two children.

18:33.629 --> 18:35.631
I'm very happy
to see my son

18:35.631 --> 18:38.133
spending time with
someone like meadow,

18:38.133 --> 18:41.136
she'll be a very
good influence on him.

18:41.136 --> 18:44.139
You did a great job,
she's a wonderful girl.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.642
Thank you,
salut.

18:49.645 --> 18:52.648
It's nice to see
our families united.

18:52.648 --> 18:55.651
Like with ralphie,
he goes on and on

18:55.651 --> 18:57.653
about tony and
the promotion.

18:57.653 --> 18:59.655
He's very happy to
be getting closer to him.

18:59.655 --> 19:01.156
Well, ralph is a
real find, ro,

19:01.156 --> 19:02.658
you hang on to him.

19:02.658 --> 19:04.159
You know, it was
tough at first.

19:04.159 --> 19:07.663
I was afraid everyone
was gonna think i rushed,

19:07.663 --> 19:09.665
that i didn't
mourn jack enough.

19:09.665 --> 19:11.667
Oh, artie!

19:13.669 --> 19:16.171
I think he's under
a lot of stress.

19:16.171 --> 19:18.173
I hear charmaine
hired a lawyer.

19:18.173 --> 19:20.175
Divorce?

19:22.177 --> 19:24.680
It's funny, but,
you'd think,

19:24.680 --> 19:28.183
you know, the men in
our lives have been,

19:28.183 --> 19:31.186
you know what, and
we've stayed together,

19:31.186 --> 19:33.188
and here's artie,
a regular guy,

19:33.188 --> 19:36.692
hardworking,
and his marriage
is in the pisciadood.

19:37.192 --> 19:39.194
You can push a
man only so far.

19:39.194 --> 19:41.196
True, very true.

19:49.705 --> 19:50.706
You know what?

19:51.206 --> 19:52.708
If you wait
inside for me

19:52.708 --> 19:55.210
i'll be in there in
just a second, okay?

19:59.715 --> 20:02.217
Hello.

20:02.217 --> 20:03.719
Who's the
douchebag?

20:03.719 --> 20:06.722
That douchebag buys
a new 600 from me
every year.

20:06.722 --> 20:08.724
This was last year.

20:08.724 --> 20:09.725
Nice.

20:14.730 --> 20:16.231
Been shopping?

20:17.733 --> 20:19.735
It's for you.

20:30.746 --> 20:32.247
It's very
beautiful.

20:32.247 --> 20:34.249
So are you.

20:34.249 --> 20:37.252
What are my chances
of kidnapping you

20:37.252 --> 20:39.254
for the rest of
the afternoon?

20:39.254 --> 20:42.257
I'm closing
on a car.

20:42.758 --> 20:44.259
Come on.

20:44.259 --> 20:46.762
Let hans and franz
do the paperwork.

20:46.762 --> 20:49.264
I'm goin' nuts
thinking about you.

20:49.264 --> 20:52.267
I've gotta work.

20:59.274 --> 21:01.276
Trabajar?

21:01.777 --> 21:03.278
Come on, come on!

21:03.278 --> 21:04.780
I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.782
The pierre, the
sherry netherlands,

21:07.282 --> 21:09.785
you pick it, come on,
anywhere you wanna go.

21:12.287 --> 21:14.790
Wanna go to the zoo?

21:15.290 --> 21:17.292
The zoo?

21:17.292 --> 21:20.796
Yeah, i try to g
et there once a year.

21:21.296 --> 21:23.298
Alright, we'll go.

21:23.298 --> 21:25.801
I'll call you.

21:32.557 --> 21:34.476
Amazing thing
about snakes

21:34.476 --> 21:36.979
is that they reproduce
spontaneously.

21:37.479 --> 21:38.981
Whaddaya mean?

21:39.481 --> 21:42.484
They have both male
and female sex organs.

21:42.484 --> 21:44.486
That's why somebody
you don't trust,

21:44.486 --> 21:46.038
you call a snake.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.990
How can you trust a guy
who can literally

21:47.990 --> 21:50.492
go fuck themselves?

21:50.492 --> 21:52.995
Don't you think
that expression

21:52.995 --> 21:55.497
would come from the
adam and eve story?

21:55.497 --> 21:58.500
When the snake tempted
eve to bite the apple?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.502
Hey, snakes we
re fuckin' themselves

22:00.502 --> 22:03.005
long before adam and
eve showed up, t.

22:09.511 --> 22:13.015
...been studying these
snakes for over 15 years...

22:15.017 --> 22:16.518
hey, how ya
doin', kid?

22:17.019 --> 22:17.519
Alright.

22:17.519 --> 22:19.021

22:19.021 --> 22:21.023
Thanks f
or coming by.

22:21.023 --> 22:22.524
How are you?

22:22.524 --> 22:24.026
Have a seat.

22:24.026 --> 22:25.527
Want something
to drink?

22:25.527 --> 22:26.528
What are you
having?

22:27.029 --> 22:28.030
A litt
le red wine.

22:28.030 --> 22:29.031
Okay.

22:29.031 --> 22:30.532
I'm goin' to get
a couple of slices.

22:30.532 --> 22:31.533
You want
anything, t?

22:32.034 --> 22:33.035
Yeah, get me

22:35.037 --> 22:36.538
Jackie, you
want somethin'?

22:36.538 --> 22:38.040
No, thanks.

22:40.542 --> 22:42.544
So...

22:42.544 --> 22:45.547
i hear you're taki
n' meadow out tonight.

22:45.547 --> 22:47.549
Yeah.

22:47.549 --> 22:49.051
Where?

22:49.051 --> 22:51.553
A place in the city
called "chez josephine".

22:51.553 --> 22:53.555
The food's
supposed to be good,

22:53.555 --> 22:55.057
and they have
live piano music.

22:55.057 --> 22:56.558
Harry connick jr.
Used to play there

22:56.558 --> 22:58.060
before he became famous.

22:58.060 --> 23:00.562
A friend of mine's brother
is the bartender there.

23:00.562 --> 23:02.564
Don't you two

23:02.564 --> 23:04.566
She's got a 2:00

23:04.566 --> 23:06.568
How many days off
they give you at rutgers?

23:09.071 --> 23:11.573
I got class
three days a week.

23:13.075 --> 23:16.578
Listen, i think
you're a good kid.

23:16.578 --> 23:19.081
You show respect
at my house,

23:19.081 --> 23:21.083
and you come fro
m a good family.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.584
Thanks.

23:22.584 --> 23:24.586
As far as my
daughter goes,

23:24.586 --> 23:27.589
and you know i only
want the best for her,

23:27.589 --> 23:30.592
i'm gonna be ver
y protective over her.

23:31.093 --> 23:33.095
You can understand
that, right?

23:33.095 --> 23:34.096
Of course.

23:34.096 --> 23:36.098
So, if you want to
spend time with her,

23:36.098 --> 23:37.599
i want the best from you.

23:37.599 --> 23:39.101
If you're in school,

23:39.101 --> 23:40.602

t everything you got.

23:40.602 --> 23:41.603

23:50.112 --> 23:52.614
You understand what
i'm saying to you?

23:52.614 --> 23:54.616
I just got an "a"
on my lit. Paper.

23:54.616 --> 23:56.118
You did?

23:56.118 --> 23:58.120

23:58.120 --> 24:01.123
Good writer, what

24:01.123 --> 24:03.625
He's the guy
who did all the,

24:03.625 --> 24:05.627
the vincent price
shit, right?

24:06.128 --> 24:08.630
The guy smoked opium
and married his cousin.

24:08.630 --> 24:10.132
He was from the bronx,
you believe that?

24:10.132 --> 24:12.134
So, you got an "a", huh?

24:12.634 --> 24:14.136
I'm doing

24:14.136 --> 24:15.637
Let's keep it

24:33.155 --> 24:34.656
No, that's okay.

24:34.656 --> 24:37.159
Take it, just don't
keep her out too late.

24:37.159 --> 24:40.162
I won't,
thanks, tony.

24:51.173 --> 24:52.674
Welcome, everybody,

24:52.674 --> 24:54.176
to opening night
at "crazy horse".

24:56.678 --> 24:59.181
I'm very excited
to have, from u- dub,

24:59.681 --> 25:01.683
our very first band.

25:01.683 --> 25:04.686
Please welcome
"the miami relatives"!

25:50.732 --> 25:52.234
What do you think?

25:52.234 --> 25:53.235
What?

25:53.735 --> 25:54.736
What do you thin
k of this place?

25:55.237 --> 25:58.240
I can't hear a
word you're saying.

26:10.252 --> 26:12.754
How do you
like the band?

26:19.761 --> 26:21.763
Matush, you don't got
those maserati's any more?

26:21.763 --> 26:24.266
Only versace
, you try it yet?

26:24.266 --> 26:26.268
No, i like the
maserati, though.

26:26.768 --> 26:29.771
Try the versace,
you won't be sorry.

26:31.273 --> 26:32.774
Hey, hey!
What's up?

26:32.774 --> 26:34.276
What's up?

26:34.776 --> 26:35.777
Come on,
let's go, out!

26:37.779 --> 26:39.281
I got friends
here, man!

26:39.281 --> 26:41.783
Let me call
my man carlo!

26:41.783 --> 26:45.287
I see you again, i'm
gonna crack your head!

26:45.787 --> 26:47.789
Call carlo!

26:57.799 --> 27:00.302
You have to wonder
what they're thinking.

27:00.302 --> 27:02.804
They're thinking,
"madonn',

27:02.804 --> 27:04.306
"you guys ever
smell yourselves?

27:04.306 --> 27:06.308
'Cause you're
killing us over here!"

27:06.808 --> 27:08.810
You're probably
right, huh?

27:08.810 --> 27:10.812
'Cept for you.

27:10.812 --> 27:13.815
What you got on,
even a baboon
would love.

27:15.817 --> 27:17.819
The eyes are innocent.

27:19.321 --> 27:21.823
Like a baby's.

27:21.823 --> 27:24.826
Yeah, he could innocently
maul you into 10 pieces.

27:24.826 --> 27:29.331
Usually, they just engage
what's called threat behavior.

27:29.331 --> 27:31.833
That's'cause they did
all their mauling.

27:31.833 --> 27:33.835
Now all they gotta do
is give you the look.

27:37.839 --> 27:39.341
You know h
ow the primates,

27:39.341 --> 27:41.843
they groom
each other?

27:41.843 --> 27:44.846
That i like.

27:44.846 --> 27:47.349
What's this?

27:47.849 --> 27:51.853
It's a tibetan talisman,
for protection.

27:51.853 --> 27:55.857
I knew it, i
knew there had
to be something.

27:55.857 --> 27:58.360
What?

27:58.360 --> 28:01.363
What is wrong with that
? it's a buddhist symbol.

28:01.363 --> 28:04.866
My sister
was a buddhist,
she's a whackjob.

28:04.866 --> 28:07.369
Ah, i see, so i gott
a be a whackjob too?

28:07.869 --> 28:09.871
Well, it is a
little wacky.

28:10.372 --> 28:12.874
What's wrong with
fuckin' catholicism?

28:12.874 --> 28:15.377
Oh, which you
fuckin' practi
ce every fuckin' day,

28:15.377 --> 28:16.878
i'm sure.

28:16.878 --> 28:18.880
So, i pray
a little bit,

28:18.880 --> 28:20.382
and i meditate
in the morning.

28:20.882 --> 28:23.885
It clears my mind and
my heart for the day.

28:27.389 --> 28:30.392
A buddhist selling
$150, 000 cars.

28:30.392 --> 28:33.895
The first
noble truth is

28:33.895 --> 28:36.398
life is suffering,

28:36.398 --> 28:39.401
but, the buddha preached
"joyful participation

28:39.401 --> 28:41.903
in the sorrows
of the world".

28:42.404 --> 28:44.406
So, you make a sal
e, you don't make a sale,

28:44.406 --> 28:45.907
it's a tiny
little thing.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.922
What's so funny?

29:00.922 --> 29:01.923
You came
here today.

29:02.424 --> 29:02.924
What, the zoo?

29:03.425 --> 29:04.426
I said,"zoo",
and you came.

29:04.926 --> 29:06.928
This is a fuckin'
head trip now?

29:06.928 --> 29:08.430
Huh? Nice!

29:08.930 --> 29:10.432
Sorta.

29:10.432 --> 29:12.434
I don't like that.

29:12.434 --> 29:13.935
You're very sweet.

29:15.937 --> 29:17.439
You came.

29:19.441 --> 29:21.943
I'm crazy
about you.

29:21.943 --> 29:24.946
You know that,
don't you?

29:24.946 --> 29:27.449
I've never met
anybody like you.

29:33.955 --> 29:35.957
Okay, class, come
on, come this way.

29:36.458 --> 29:37.959
Stay together,
kids, come on.

29:37.959 --> 29:39.461
We're gonna see
some tigers.

29:39.461 --> 29:41.463
You all remember
yesterday...

29:43.965 --> 29:45.967
you take your ki
ds to the bronx zoo?

29:45.967 --> 29:46.968
Yeah.

29:47.469 --> 29:49.471
And, now
we're here.

29:50.972 --> 29:51.973
See ya later.

29:51.973 --> 29:53.975
Who was that?

29:53.975 --> 29:55.477
Oh, that was
my hard- on.

29:57.479 --> 29:59.481
Oh...

29:59.481 --> 30:03.985
between the buddhism
and talk about the family,

30:03.985 --> 30:05.987
poor you.

30:08.990 --> 30:13.495
Let me see if
it's really gone.

30:13.495 --> 30:15.497
You lie.

30:27.008 --> 30:29.511
You know snakes can
fuck themselves?

30:29.511 --> 30:31.012
Give me your hand.

30:37.519 --> 30:39.020
Oh, jesus christ.

31:03.044 --> 31:05.046
Don't move.

31:05.046 --> 31:06.548
What?

31:07.048 --> 31:08.550
See...

31:08.550 --> 31:10.552
...if you...

31:10.552 --> 31:12.554
...cannot...

31:28.570 --> 31:31.072
so, what happened?

31:31.072 --> 31:33.074
He was at "the
crazy horse",

31:33.074 --> 31:35.076
and some zip, he
told my man here

31:35.076 --> 31:37.579
"new management,
new rules".

31:37.579 --> 31:40.582
So, i asked around,
heard about some guy,

31:40.582 --> 31:42.584
multi- something,

31:42.584 --> 31:44.586
some made guy in
the soprano family

31:44.586 --> 31:46.588
was runnin
g things now.

31:46.588 --> 31:48.089
I go,"whoa!"

31:48.089 --> 31:49.090
Chris moltisanti.

31:49.090 --> 31:50.592
Yeah, that's
the name.

31:50.592 --> 31:52.093
I know chris.

31:54.596 --> 31:56.097
What's you
r name again?

31:56.097 --> 31:57.599
Matush.

32:00.101 --> 32:03.104
Normally, i woul
d never get involved
with a stranger,

32:03.605 --> 32:06.608
but, if carlo, here,
is vouching for you,

32:06.608 --> 32:09.110
i'm willing to
make an exception,

32:09.110 --> 32:10.111
and take
care of it.

32:10.111 --> 32:11.613
Thank you.

32:12.113 --> 32:14.115
What'd i tell you
about my man, jackie?

32:14.616 --> 32:16.117
You know who
my father was?

32:16.618 --> 32:20.622
The golfer?
U. S. Open?

32:21.122 --> 32:24.125
Chris and me
are associates.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.127
You got nothin
g to worry about.

32:26.628 --> 32:29.130
I'll call carlo in
a couple of days.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.135
Meeting over.

32:34.135 --> 32:36.638
Verbum dei has a strict,
zero- tolerance policy

32:36.638 --> 32:38.139
in cases of vandalism.

32:38.139 --> 32:40.642
It is a policy
that demands the
immediate expulsion

32:40.642 --> 32:42.644
of the offending
student.

32:42.644 --> 32:43.645
I told him.

32:43.645 --> 32:45.647
You see?

32:45.647 --> 32:48.149
Having said that,
in this case,

32:48.149 --> 32:50.652
after much deliberation
and assessment,

32:50.652 --> 32:53.154
we have decided upon
a suspended sentence.

32:53.154 --> 32:56.157
This consideration has
only been arrived at

32:56.157 --> 32:58.159
based upon anthony's
academic performance

32:58.159 --> 33:01.162
and his involvement in
extracurricular sport.

33:01.162 --> 33:02.163
His academic
performance?

33:02.664 --> 33:04.666
He's brought his
gpa up to a "c- ".

33:05.166 --> 33:06.668
So, what is
the punishment?

33:07.168 --> 33:08.169
We suggest,
and hope,

33:08.670 --> 33:11.172
that anthony's punishm
ent be meted out parentally.

33:11.172 --> 33:13.174
So, it's not exactly
zero tolerance.

33:13.174 --> 33:15.176
Each child is special.

33:15.176 --> 33:17.679
That's a guiding principle
of this school, too.

33:17.679 --> 33:20.682
Well, what
about detention?

33:20.682 --> 33:22.183
A lawsuit a
few years back

33:22.183 --> 33:24.686
forced us to eliminate
our detention program.

33:24.686 --> 33:27.188
Well, he's off the
football team, right?

33:27.188 --> 33:28.189
No.

33:28.189 --> 33:31.693
Studies done at
harvard, and elsewhere,

33:31.693 --> 33:34.195
have shown that boys
have greater success

33:34.195 --> 33:36.197
in avoiding
the pitfalls
of adolescence

33:36.197 --> 33:37.699
when they remain
committed to,

33:37.699 --> 33:40.201
and involved
in, sport.

33:40.201 --> 33:42.704
You better wipe that
smile off your face.

33:45.707 --> 33:48.209
Look, i told him he wa
s gonna be off the team.

33:48.209 --> 33:50.211
Now, i mean,
you're kind of...

33:50.712 --> 33:51.713
undermining--

33:51.713 --> 33:54.215
it's not only skill
that anthony has shown

33:54.716 --> 33:55.717
on the football field,

33:55.717 --> 33:57.218
it's leadership
qualities as well.

33:57.719 --> 34:00.221
We feel that it would be
against his best interests,

34:00.221 --> 34:02.724
and the team's,

34:02.724 --> 34:04.726
to sever his relationship
with the squad.

34:05.226 --> 34:07.729
Well, if you think
that's best...

34:07.729 --> 34:11.232
however, and i can't
say this strongly enough,

34:11.232 --> 34:14.735
if there is but one more
infraction of our code,

34:14.735 --> 34:17.237
the sentence will
immediately go into effect

34:17.237 --> 34:19.239
and anthony
will be expelled.

34:20.742 --> 34:23.244
Do you understand
this, anthony?

34:23.745 --> 34:25.746
Yes.

34:25.746 --> 34:27.748
You completely
sold us out in there.

34:27.748 --> 34:28.750
What'd i do?

34:28.750 --> 34:31.252
They are not punishing
him at all, tony,

34:31.252 --> 34:33.254
and you went
right along with it.

34:33.254 --> 34:34.755
I suggeste
d detention.

34:35.255 --> 34:36.757
That whole thing was
a disgusting charade

34:36.757 --> 34:38.259
so that the fucking
freshman football team

34:38.259 --> 34:39.761
can win the big game.

34:40.261 --> 34:41.763
We've been waiting
for years for him
to get off the couch,

34:41.763 --> 34:42.764
this is good for him.

34:43.264 --> 34:44.264
Oh, please!

34:44.264 --> 34:45.266
We should keep thi
s in the family,

34:45.766 --> 34:46.768
punish him at home.

34:46.768 --> 34:48.268
He ain't getti
ng off that easy!

34:48.268 --> 34:52.273
Overall, it's been
a good two weeks.

34:52.273 --> 34:54.275
What about
the nightmares?

34:54.275 --> 34:55.777
None.

34:58.279 --> 35:00.782
I had a wonderful dream

35:00.782 --> 35:03.785
where i lit the big
torch at the olympics.

35:03.785 --> 35:05.787
What do you think
that represented?

35:05.787 --> 35:08.790
Well, work
has been good.

35:09.791 --> 35:12.293
My sales are way up.

35:13.294 --> 35:16.297
And my performance
has been commended

35:16.297 --> 35:19.300
by mercedes benz u. S. A. ,
with a little plaque.

35:19.801 --> 35:22.804
What's going on with
your social life?

35:22.804 --> 35:23.805
Nothing...

35:26.307 --> 35:28.309
...right now.

35:30.311 --> 35:31.813
But, it's okay.

35:34.816 --> 35:37.318
What i'm going to say
is a little delicate,

35:37.318 --> 35:39.320
but, i think
it's important.

35:39.821 --> 35:42.824
When you called me
last week to cancel,

35:42.824 --> 35:44.826
i heard a man's voice.

35:47.829 --> 35:49.831
My car broke down.

35:53.334 --> 35:55.336
It could've
been the mechanic.

35:55.336 --> 35:56.838
I see.

36:04.345 --> 36:07.348
I'm a little offended th
at you put it to me that way.

36:07.348 --> 36:09.851
Offended, why?

36:09.851 --> 36:12.854
Well, i don't
pay you to be under
your surveillance.

36:15.356 --> 36:17.358
How dare you?

36:17.358 --> 36:19.861
You came to me after
attempting suicide

36:19.861 --> 36:22.363
over the break
up with barry.

36:22.363 --> 36:25.867
I ask you because
you're under my care.

36:25.867 --> 36:28.870
I think it's very
unprofessional ofyou

36:29.370 --> 36:30.872
to confront me this way.

36:30.872 --> 36:34.375
Suicide is something
i take very seriously.

36:34.375 --> 36:35.877
Well, the doctor
in the e. R. Said

36:35.877 --> 36:38.379
it was only
suicidal ideation.

36:38.379 --> 36:40.882
Is he trained to give
those diagnoses?

36:41.382 --> 36:42.884
My car broke down.

36:42.884 --> 36:44.385
Fine.

36:44.886 --> 36:47.388
I'll believe you.

36:47.388 --> 36:48.890
Thank you.

36:53.394 --> 36:55.897
To "the crazy horse",
buona fortuna.

36:55.897 --> 36:57.398
Salut.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.402
The club business
ain't easy,

37:01.402 --> 37:02.904
i'll t
ell you that.

37:02.904 --> 37:04.405
With "the bing",

37:04.405 --> 37:07.408
everybody only
sees the glitz
and glamour.

37:07.909 --> 37:09.911
Nobody really know
s what goes into it.

37:09.911 --> 37:11.913
There's a lot
to deal with.

37:11.913 --> 37:13.414
I know.

37:13.414 --> 37:15.416
See, it's one
thing to have
a bar and sell drinks,

37:15.917 --> 37:17.919
but, when you're
dealing with performers,

37:18.419 --> 37:20.421
i don't care

37:20.922 --> 37:22.423
if it's music,
tits,

37:22.423 --> 37:25.426
fire- eaters, it's a
whole other game,

37:25.927 --> 37:27.428
'cause ultimately,

37:27.428 --> 37:29.931
you're relying on them
to get the customers in,

37:29.931 --> 37:31.933
and spend money.

37:33.935 --> 37:36.938
Alright,
i'll take it
upstairs.

37:43.444 --> 37:44.445
How you doin'?

37:44.445 --> 37:45.947
Alright.

37:51.452 --> 37:52.954
How you doin'?

37:52.954 --> 37:54.956
Somebody's
sitting there.

38:01.963 --> 38:03.965
I'll t
ake a 7 &7.

38:03.965 --> 38:04.966
And whatever my
friend here wants.

38:05.466 --> 38:06.467
I'm good.

38:06.467 --> 38:07.969
Just 7 & 7.

38:09.971 --> 38:11.472
Congrats
on the club.

38:11.472 --> 38:13.474
I only have admiration
for your progress

38:13.975 --> 38:14.976
ever since you got
your button.

38:14.976 --> 38:15.977
Thanks.

38:15.977 --> 38:16.978
Thanks.

38:16.978 --> 38:18.479
Sure.

38:18.479 --> 38:20.481
I wanted to
have a little
sit- down withyou

38:20.481 --> 38:23.484
about a friend of mi
ne who was doing some
business at your club.

38:23.484 --> 38:24.986
And when did you
want to do this?

38:25.486 --> 38:25.987
Now, if it's okay.

38:26.487 --> 38:27.989
Now's okay for a chat,
not a sit- down.

38:27.989 --> 38:30.491
Okay, this friend of mine
was movin' a little x

38:30.491 --> 38:31.993
at the club before
you took over,

38:31.993 --> 38:34.495
and the other night
he got thrown out
on his ass.

38:34.495 --> 38:35.997
And?

38:35.997 --> 38:39.000
No, i wanted to ask
you, as a favor to me,

38:39.000 --> 38:42.003
to let him keep a little
action goin' on.

38:44.505 --> 38:46.007
You'll get a piece
of whatever he does.

38:46.007 --> 38:47.508
X is federal
territory now.

38:48.009 --> 38:50.011
They got task forces
with dogs and shit,

38:50.011 --> 38:51.512
i don't want
it in my club.

38:51.512 --> 38:53.014
It would m
ean a lot to me.

38:55.016 --> 38:58.019
You got a lotta balls.
Did you hear what i said?

38:58.019 --> 38:59.020
Yeah.

38:59.020 --> 39:01.022
What'd i say?

39:03.024 --> 39:04.025
No.

39:04.025 --> 39:05.026
End of chat.

39:05.026 --> 39:06.527
Okay, thanks.

39:30.051 --> 39:31.552
It's all
taken care of.

39:32.053 --> 39:33.054
Thanks, man.

39:33.554 --> 39:35.056
You just can't
do it in the club.

39:35.556 --> 39:37.058
Have your customers
meet you outside.

39:37.058 --> 39:39.560
Outside where?

39:39.560 --> 39:42.063
Near the club,
use your car,

39:42.563 --> 39:44.565
or their cars,

39:44.565 --> 39:45.566
find an alley...

39:46.067 --> 39:47.568
i gotta fuckin' th
ink it all out for you?

39:48.069 --> 39:50.071
That's gonna make things
a lot harder on me.

39:50.071 --> 39:52.573
This all happens for
good reason right now.

39:52.573 --> 39:55.576
Reasons beyond anythin
g you could possibly know.

39:58.079 --> 40:00.581
In time, everything
will be revealed to you.

40:01.082 --> 40:04.085
Couple of weeks you'll b
e back inside, don't worry.

40:04.085 --> 40:08.089
If that's the way it is,
that's the way it is.

40:08.089 --> 40:09.590
I'll see you.

40:09.590 --> 40:11.092
Are you
forgetting
something?

40:11.592 --> 40:13.094
What?

40:13.094 --> 40:16.097
I'm looking out
for you here.

40:16.097 --> 40:18.099
I gotta eat
too, right?

40:18.099 --> 40:22.103
Yeah, sure, i'll
take care of you.

40:22.103 --> 40:23.604
I'll be by
every sunday.

40:24.105 --> 40:25.106
Cool.

40:36.117 --> 40:39.120
Your father an
d i have discussed
your punishment.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.122
You're grounded
for a month.

40:41.622 --> 40:44.625
That means no nintendo,
no dvds, no skateboards.

40:45.126 --> 40:46.627
And no computer.

40:46.627 --> 40:48.129
I use the computer
for school.

40:48.129 --> 40:50.131
Get the typewriter
out of the basement.

40:50.131 --> 40:51.132
Dad threw it out.

40:51.132 --> 40:53.134
Then use a pen,

40:53.134 --> 40:55.136
it worked for einstein,
it can work for you.

40:55.136 --> 40:57.138
And, on top of that,
you're gonna work

40:57.138 --> 40:58.139
your little ass
off around here,

40:58.139 --> 40:59.640
which you should've
been doin' anyway.

40:59.640 --> 41:00.641
Okay.

41:00.641 --> 41:02.643
Okay or not,
you got no choice.

41:02.643 --> 41:04.145
Number one, you
go to the garage,
you clean it out,

41:04.145 --> 41:05.646
you make it neat
and organized.

41:06.147 --> 41:08.149
Jackie jr. Did tha
t the other day.

41:08.149 --> 41:10.651
See what i'm sayin'
about him?

41:10.651 --> 41:13.654
You oughta take
a few lessons from
jackie aprile, okay?

41:13.654 --> 41:15.156
Get your act
together.

41:15.656 --> 41:16.657
The kid's pre- med
at rutgers,

41:16.657 --> 41:19.160
he finds time to come
down here and help out.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.163
And, you are going
to clean the gutters.

41:22.163 --> 41:23.164
What gutters?

41:23.164 --> 41:24.665
On the roof.

41:25.166 --> 41:26.167
Where?

41:26.167 --> 41:27.668
On the edge, the things
that collect the water?

41:27.668 --> 41:28.669
I don't know
what you mean.

41:28.669 --> 41:29.670
Don't get smart
with me!

41:29.670 --> 41:30.671
I don't know.

41:31.172 --> 41:32.673
The drainpip
es for the rain?

41:33.674 --> 41:35.176
C'mere.

41:38.679 --> 41:40.181
Very good.

41:40.181 --> 41:42.183
Obviously a lady
of discerning taste.

41:42.183 --> 41:43.684
Come on!

41:43.684 --> 41:44.685
I told you once.

41:44.685 --> 41:46.187
My man
jackie said--

41:46.187 --> 41:49.190
don't fuck
in' name drop me!

41:49.190 --> 41:51.192
We're gonn
a take a walk.

41:54.195 --> 41:57.198
Well, right arm's
still good, no?

41:57.698 --> 42:00.201
You think that's funny?

42:00.201 --> 42:02.203
Sorry.

42:04.205 --> 42:06.207
Tell me
what happened.

42:06.207 --> 42:09.210
I did like you said,
i stayed outside.

42:09.710 --> 42:11.212
You musta disrespected
them or something.

42:11.212 --> 42:13.214
Ugh! I--

42:13.214 --> 42:15.216
i didn't do fuck!

42:15.216 --> 42:16.217
Did you mention
my name,

42:16.717 --> 42:18.719
that i sat down
with chris?

42:18.719 --> 42:20.721
They didn'
t give a shit.

42:21.222 --> 42:24.225
I don't think
they like you.

42:26.227 --> 42:28.229
I gotta pee.

42:30.231 --> 42:32.233
Can you give me
the thing?

42:35.236 --> 42:37.238
You should get the
nurse to help you.

42:37.238 --> 42:39.740
That's what they
get paid for.

42:39.740 --> 42:42.743
Maybe she'll be fine and
give you a cheap thrill.

42:50.251 --> 42:53.254
Hello...kelli?
Hiya, hon.

42:53.254 --> 42:55.256
It's your
sister.

42:55.256 --> 42:57.758
Now, this is t
he most crucial part.

42:57.758 --> 43:01.262
You put the pa
sta back in the pot,

43:01.262 --> 43:03.264
you add
a little gravy...

43:04.265 --> 43:05.766
and a little butter,

43:06.767 --> 43:07.768
then,

43:07.768 --> 43:10.771
you put the
fire back on,

43:12.273 --> 43:16.777
for 45 seconds,
stir it up, real nice.

43:16.777 --> 43:18.279
45 seconds?

43:18.279 --> 43:21.782
Yeah, that
way the macaroni
absorbs the gravy

43:21.782 --> 43:24.285
instead of
just coats it.

43:24.285 --> 43:25.786
This is for flavor.

43:26.787 --> 43:28.289
I need a favor.

43:28.289 --> 43:29.790
What?

43:29.790 --> 43:31.792
I need a piece.

43:32.293 --> 43:34.295
I mean, i don't
need one, but,

43:34.295 --> 43:35.296
you know.

43:42.803 --> 43:44.805
Anything you
wanna tell me?

43:44.805 --> 43:47.308
No, it's just i
think it's time, i...

43:47.308 --> 43:49.310
you know.

43:49.310 --> 43:51.312
What are you
lookin' to get?

43:51.312 --> 43:53.814
I don't know,
what do you suggest?

43:53.814 --> 43:56.817
Me, i like to know
the motherfucker's
gonna work.

43:58.819 --> 44:00.321
And a. 38...

44:04.325 --> 44:06.327
it'll never
jam on you,

44:06.327 --> 44:08.329
plus, it's small.

44:08.329 --> 44:10.331
But, if you're lookin'
to make a point,

44:10.331 --> 44:12.333
you might wanna go
with something bigger.

44:12.333 --> 44:14.335
Nah, it's not really
for intimidation.

44:14.335 --> 44:16.337
It's just in case.

44:16.337 --> 44:18.339
I'd go with
the. 38.

44:19.340 --> 44:21.342
You can have
this one.

44:21.342 --> 44:22.843
I got another one
under the bed.

44:27.348 --> 44:29.350
How much i owe
you for it?

44:29.350 --> 44:32.853
Get outta here,
your money's no good.

44:32.853 --> 44:35.356
Macaroni's
ready!

44:58.879 --> 45:00.881
I just wanna
tell you,

45:00.881 --> 45:04.385
that i don't expec
t anything from you.

45:05.886 --> 45:08.889
Well, kindness,
but, that's it.

45:11.892 --> 45:13.394
Okay.

45:15.396 --> 45:16.897
God!

45:16.897 --> 45:20.901
You really are in
love with yourself,

45:20.901 --> 45:22.903
aren't you?

45:25.906 --> 45:29.410
What do you mean,
conceited?

45:30.911 --> 45:33.414
Self- centered.

45:33.414 --> 45:36.417
Okay, there's a bunch
of alternates

45:36.417 --> 45:38.419
you could've said.

45:41.422 --> 45:43.924
You deprive
yourself of nothing.

45:55.936 --> 45:57.938
You th
ink i'm vain?

45:57.938 --> 45:59.940
I think
you're wonderful.

46:23.464 --> 46:25.966
"And her name
is "g".

46:43.984 --> 46:45.486
A- ha.

46:45.486 --> 46:48.489
Some of my accounts
are in bad neighborhoods.

46:48.489 --> 46:50.991
I know why you lie...

46:52.493 --> 46:54.995
but, you don't
have to.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.502
Can i hold it?

47:15.015 --> 47:16.517
It's heavy.

47:16.517 --> 47:18.519
Is it loaded?

47:18.519 --> 47:21.021
Nothing's more useless
than an unloaded gun.

47:22.523 --> 47:24.525
Here you go.

47:27.528 --> 47:30.030
Mr. Waste management.

47:30.030 --> 47:32.032
Come here.

47:42.543 --> 47:45.045
I mean we're
paying the school,

47:45.045 --> 47:47.548
we're buying
a service.

47:47.548 --> 47:51.051
And if it's their opinio
n that he shouldn't get
treated too harshly...

47:52.553 --> 47:55.055
you gotta listen to
the experts, right?

47:59.059 --> 48:00.561
What else
is going on?

48:00.561 --> 48:03.063
How was the rest
of your week?

48:03.063 --> 48:05.566
To be honest
, very good.

48:06.066 --> 48:07.067
Why is that?

48:07.568 --> 48:09.570
Well, that's h
ow life is, i guess.

48:09.570 --> 48:12.573
Sometimes it's goo
d, sometimes it's bad.

48:12.573 --> 48:14.575
Things com
e, things go.

48:14.575 --> 48:17.077
How are things between
you and carmela?

48:17.077 --> 48:19.079
She was moody for
a little while,

48:19.079 --> 48:20.581
but, now she's
her old self.

48:20.581 --> 48:23.584
Maybe it was
coming here.

48:24.084 --> 48:25.586
Possibly.

48:25.586 --> 48:29.590
Well, you do look
happy, i must say.

48:29.590 --> 48:30.591
Yeah.

48:33.093 --> 48:35.095
I went to the zoo
the other day.

48:35.596 --> 48:36.597
The zoo?

48:36.597 --> 48:37.598
Yeah.

48:38.098 --> 48:41.101
Sometimes you gott
a get away, and,

48:41.101 --> 48:43.604
stop and smell
the gorilla shit.

48:43.604 --> 48:46.607
It was good to
be in nature though.

48:46.607 --> 48:48.609
And the zoo
made you happy.

48:48.609 --> 48:49.610
Yeah.

48:54.114 --> 48:56.617
I think a lot of it'
s'cause of you, too.

48:56.617 --> 48:58.619
You put a lo
t of time into me,

48:58.619 --> 49:02.623
and, now,
it's payin' off.

49:02.623 --> 49:04.625
The progress
that you make

49:05.125 --> 49:06.126
is entirely
up to you,

49:06.627 --> 49:08.128
and how willing you are

49:08.128 --> 49:10.130
to be honest with
yourself and with me.

49:10.631 --> 49:12.132
Well, i am improving.

49:12.132 --> 49:14.635
You have to
joyfully participate

49:14.635 --> 49:16.637
in the suffering
of the world.

49:20.641 --> 49:22.643
Your thoughts
have a,

49:22.643 --> 49:24.144
kind of eastern
flavor to them.

49:24.645 --> 49:26.647
Well, i've lived in
jersey my whole life.

49:26.647 --> 49:29.650
I mean eastern
in terms of asian.

49:29.650 --> 49:32.653
Like buddhist
or taoist.

49:32.653 --> 49:35.155
Sun tzu...

49:35.155 --> 49:37.658
i told you about him.

49:41.662 --> 49:43.664
We have to
stop now.

49:44.665 --> 49:45.666
Alright.

49:49.670 --> 49:51.672
This is the co- pay

49:52.172 --> 49:55.175
i owe you
from last month.

49:55.175 --> 49:57.177
You gave me
too much.

49:58.178 --> 49:59.179
Well, i gave y
ou a little extra

49:59.680 --> 50:01.682
for the good results
this week.

50:02.182 --> 50:04.184
I can't
accept it.

50:04.184 --> 50:06.186
Give it to your
favorite charity.

50:06.186 --> 50:07.187
You better
get your phone.

50:07.187 --> 50:09.189
I'll see y
a next week.

50:14.194 --> 50:15.195
Hello.

50:15.195 --> 50:16.196
Hi, mom.

50:16.196 --> 50:17.197
Hi, jason.

50:17.197 --> 50:18.699
How are you?

50:18.699 --> 50:19.700
I hate all of them!

50:20.200 --> 50:20.701
Who?

50:20.701 --> 50:22.703
My patients,
all of them!

50:22.703 --> 50:24.204
Lying to my face,
full of shit,

50:24.705 --> 50:26.707
with no concern
for what i do

50:26.707 --> 50:28.709
or the positio
n that they put me in.

50:28.709 --> 50:30.210
I just hate them.

50:30.210 --> 50:32.212
Fuck'em,
quit.

50:32.212 --> 50:36.216
Right now, that doesn't
sound like a bad idea.

50:37.217 --> 50:38.719
I'm sorry.

50:39.219 --> 50:41.221
How are you?

50:41.221 --> 50:42.723
I'm okay.

50:42.723 --> 50:46.727
I need to buy a couple
of expensive books.

51:03.744 --> 51:04.745
Como sta.

51:04.745 --> 51:07.247
Hey ton'.
How's it goin'?

51:25.766 --> 51:27.768
Hope you're
doin' alright.

51:27.768 --> 51:29.269
Excuse me.

51:38.278 --> 51:40.280
I don't want
no teammates.

51:40.781 --> 51:41.782
Tony!

51:41.782 --> 51:42.783
How ya doin'?

51:42.783 --> 51:44.284
You up?

51:44.284 --> 51:45.285
No.

51:45.285 --> 51:46.787
Take a hit.

51:47.287 --> 51:48.789
Hit me.

51:49.790 --> 51:51.792
You shouldn't
have listened to me,

51:51.792 --> 51:53.293
it's your hand.

51:53.293 --> 51:54.795
I would've
hit anyway.

51:54.795 --> 51:57.297
C'mere, i wanna
talk to you a minute.

51:57.297 --> 51:59.299
What the fuck are
you doing here?

51:59.299 --> 52:00.300
You're here.

52:00.801 --> 52:01.802
What?

52:01.802 --> 52:03.804
I was at a bachelor party,
i got dragged here...

52:03.804 --> 52:06.306
this is exactly what
the fuck we talked
about the other day.

52:06.807 --> 52:08.809
Now get your money, and
get the fuck out of here!

52:08.809 --> 52:09.810
Sorry, tony.

52:09.810 --> 52:11.311
I never wanna
see you here again.

52:11.311 --> 52:12.312
You won't.

52:12.312 --> 52:14.314
Smarten up.

52:27.327 --> 52:28.829
Good morning.

52:31.832 --> 52:32.833
New earrings.

52:32.833 --> 52:34.835
I went out and
treated myself.

52:34.835 --> 52:36.336
They match.

52:36.336 --> 52:38.839
I almost bought the necklace
that goes along with them,

52:38.839 --> 52:40.841
but...some restraint.

52:40.841 --> 52:42.843
Although christmas
is coming, so...

52:42.843 --> 52:44.344
maybe.

52:45.846 --> 52:48.849
Any cannolis l
eft from yesterday?

52:48.849 --> 52:51.852
I think you can answer
that question yourself.

52:53.353 --> 52:55.355
Meadow still here?

52:55.355 --> 52:58.859
Jackie jr. Took her
to the city to see "aida".

52:58.859 --> 53:00.360
"I eat her"?

53:00.360 --> 53:02.863
It's the elton john
musical on broadway.

53:02.863 --> 53:03.864
Oh.

53:04.865 --> 53:07.868
I have to say, you
were right, tony.

53:07.868 --> 53:10.370
Jackie jr. Has
really surprised me.

53:10.370 --> 53:12.873
He's been a
perfect gentleman,

53:12.873 --> 53:15.375
he takes her to the city
for a little culture,

53:15.375 --> 53:16.877
he's great with a. J.

53:17.377 --> 53:18.879
So long as she does
good in school,

53:18.879 --> 53:20.881
things could be
a lot worse.
