Oh, you sweet little dears.

01:15.710 --> 01:18.620
I worry about you
working so hard.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.960
Do me a favor.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.880
Retire!

01:20.880 --> 01:22.880
Then I can sleep at night.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.290
Just name your price.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.500
Well, store's our life.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.290
Has been
for 40 years.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.580
Rumor is you'll
tear it down

01:31.580 --> 01:33.880
to build your own
private car wash.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.540
Then what would the good folk
in Grutely do for groceries?

01:37.540 --> 01:40.540
Let them eat catered.

01:56.210 --> 01:59.170
Stand by for seconds!

02:02.620 --> 02:04.750
Seconds?! Oh.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.880
What it comes
to Kanine Krunchies,

02:06.880 --> 02:09.290
there's only two words
I like better.

02:09.290 --> 02:12.040
Thirds and fourths.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.750
Kanine Krunchies
are not just food.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.960
They are love made tangible.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.080
Uh-huh.

02:26.420 --> 02:28.250
Oh, my goodness.

02:29.580 --> 02:32.830
Fiddlesticks! We ran out!

02:32.830 --> 02:34.500
Out!?

02:34.500 --> 02:36.960
As in no food?

02:38.290 --> 02:41.000
Huh. Weren't we supposed to get
a fresh truckload this morning?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.500
It was delayed
until tomorrow.

02:43.500 --> 02:47.420
Tomorrow? I could fade away
to nothing by tomorrow!

02:47.420 --> 02:51.710
Well, just drive into Grutely
and get a bag of Kanine
Krunchies to tide us over.

02:51.710 --> 02:54.710
Oh, Kanine Krunchies
is too expensive.

02:54.710 --> 02:58.420
I can get Any Mutt brand
at half the price.

02:58.420 --> 03:00.620
Whoever heard of Any Mutt?

03:00.620 --> 03:03.040
Yeah. They don't even
have a commercial.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.750
Oh, sure,

03:04.750 --> 03:06.920
feed us cut-rate kibble.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.880
Why not just kill us now
and get it over with?

03:10.880 --> 03:13.920
Let's all remain calm,
nobody panic.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.920
Our way of coping with
this tragedy is...

03:16.920 --> 03:19.580
Somebody's gotta
stop that woman!

03:19.580 --> 03:21.460
Never thought I'd say it,

03:21.460 --> 03:25.710
but I'd rather starve than eat
some no-name dog food.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.790
Goodbye, cruel world! Ugh.

03:30.790 --> 03:34.580
I know a way to get Nanny
to buy Kanine Krunchies.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.620
You do?

03:35.620 --> 03:37.290
We just have to get on that bus

03:37.290 --> 03:38.670
without Nanny seeing us.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.750
She's going in to get
the keys for the bus.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.710
Okay, go!

04:14.670 --> 04:17.040
I'm not sure
I can risk this.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.920
Every chicken knows,

04:18.920 --> 04:21.250
if you enter
a grocery store alive,

04:21.250 --> 04:23.540
you leave in shrink-wrap!

04:23.540 --> 04:27.120
Don't worry.
We're not going anywhere
near the poultry section.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.710
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:28.710 --> 04:30.580
To you it's
the "poultry section."

04:30.580 --> 04:33.790
To me, it's my class reunion!

05:11.170 --> 05:12.710
But forget your customers.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.710
It's time to think
about yourselves.

05:14.710 --> 05:18.500
I'll give you your choice
of any suite in my
retirement center,

05:18.500 --> 05:20.540
Geezer De Vil.

05:20.540 --> 05:22.420
No sale.

05:24.420 --> 05:25.750
Ingrates.

05:27.380 --> 05:28.540
Memo to myself.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.170
Think of a devious plan

05:30.170 --> 05:33.290
that will get me
their property... cheap.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.620
Okay. Here's the plan.

05:43.620 --> 05:46.790
After Nanny puts the Any Mutt
in her cart,

05:46.790 --> 05:48.290
we're gonna distract her,

05:48.290 --> 05:50.790
and switch it
for Kanine Krunchies.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.170
Psst. Come on.

06:08.620 --> 06:12.120
Wow! Thunderbolt's
newest video,

06:12.120 --> 06:15.620
where Thunderbolt battles
the masked marauders.

06:15.620 --> 06:17.620
Get 'em, Thunderbolt!

06:17.620 --> 06:20.380
Hey, cool move.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.000
Quick, Nanny's got
the Any Mutt!

06:30.460 --> 06:33.710
Okay, Rolly, you get
the Any Mutt out
of Nanny's cart.

06:33.710 --> 06:38.540
The rest of us will sneak
in a bag of Kanine Krunchies.

06:38.540 --> 06:41.210
I don't get it, Jasper.
Where's the fire?

06:41.210 --> 06:43.420
No, you doofus!

06:45.250 --> 06:47.750
Cruella's plan
is to close down the store

06:47.750 --> 06:50.790
because they don't meet
the fire codes.

07:08.620 --> 07:09.620
Aah!

07:12.290 --> 07:13.290
Mama?

07:24.830 --> 07:26.580
Whoa!

07:28.120 --> 07:31.000
Whoa! Aah!

07:34.210 --> 07:36.290
My, this cart's frisky.

07:38.670 --> 07:42.210
Fools! Bumblers! Incompetents!

07:42.210 --> 07:43.920
Here. Put on these
burglar masks

07:43.920 --> 07:47.380
and go rob those
two old coots.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.420
Rob?

07:48.420 --> 07:50.000
Exactly.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.920
If they think this area
is riddled with crime,

07:52.920 --> 07:56.170
they'll be so scared,
they'll beg me to buy them out.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.750
Do it right this time!

07:57.750 --> 07:59.710
I'll be waiting!

08:01.880 --> 08:03.330
It's too late.

08:03.330 --> 08:06.460
Our next meal
will be Any Mutt.

08:06.460 --> 08:07.460
No!

08:07.460 --> 08:09.420
We can still get
Kanine Krunchies.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.540
Hold paws and say it with me.

08:11.540 --> 08:15.670
We can get the Krunchies.
We can get the Krunchies.

08:15.670 --> 08:18.380
Okay, now don't
forget your lines.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.540
I got it.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.460
This is a fork-up.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.920
Stick out your money.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.290
No, Horace, say it right!

08:25.290 --> 08:27.460
It's "This is a stickup--"

08:27.460 --> 08:29.330
Yeah. Our stickup.

08:29.330 --> 08:31.420
We've been casing this
place for months.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.170
You watch 'em, Fingers.

08:33.170 --> 08:36.500
I'll get some rope and tie up
these two buttinskies.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.790
And don't forget
my bag of Any Mutt.

08:38.790 --> 08:42.170
Freeze, everybody!
This is a holdup!

08:43.540 --> 08:46.290
A robbery?
This is awful.

08:46.290 --> 08:50.580
Yeah. I guess this is the part
where we leave before
we get hurt.

08:50.580 --> 08:52.210
No, wait!

08:52.210 --> 08:54.540
This is just like
in Thunderbolt the movie.

08:54.540 --> 08:56.960
Listen. Here's what we do.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.120
-Jackpot!

08:59.120 --> 09:01.170
This is even heavier
than I thought it would be.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.420
If you know what's
good for you,

09:03.420 --> 09:05.500
don't move!

09:08.750 --> 09:10.460
Oww!

09:10.460 --> 09:13.460
Let go! Hey, let go!

09:13.460 --> 09:16.040
Hyah! Yah!

09:18.500 --> 09:19.500
Oww!

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Let go!

09:26.170 --> 09:27.670
Get that rat off me!

09:27.670 --> 09:29.920
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

09:32.290 --> 09:33.670
Let's get out of here!

09:34.960 --> 09:36.500
Oh, just our luck.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.670
Now how are we gonna
make our getaway?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.210
This way,
you blithering twits!

09:44.250 --> 09:46.920
Hey, wait a--
What are you--

09:48.710 --> 09:50.250
Hey, where's the loot?

09:50.250 --> 09:52.880
This is nothing but
a bunch of dog food!

09:52.880 --> 09:54.880
What are you two
babbling about now?

09:54.880 --> 09:57.750
I demand you turn
this car around
and take me back

09:57.750 --> 10:01.920
so I can make Mom and Pop
a ridiculously low offer
for their store.

10:01.920 --> 10:05.710
To close the deal, I even
brought this sack of cash.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.290
Cruella:
Wait, a minute. What are you--

10:10.290 --> 10:12.000
Whoa!

10:12.000 --> 10:13.460
Do you know who I-- Oof!

10:20.380 --> 10:24.040
Oh, well, looks like
you pups are heroes!

10:24.040 --> 10:27.420
But you know you're not
allowed in the grocery stores.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.420
Oh, dear. What am I gonna tell
Roger and Anita?

10:30.420 --> 10:31.670
You can tell 'em

10:31.670 --> 10:34.460
that these little guys
saved our money.

10:34.460 --> 10:37.000
And saved our store.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.500
Here. You deserve a reward.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.790
All right!

10:43.790 --> 10:47.710
Kanine Krunchies,
just like Nanny used to pour.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.250
I'd know 'em anywhere.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.830
Yeah, but this must be
the new extra gravy flavor.

10:54.830 --> 10:56.080
It's even better!

10:56.080 --> 10:59.580
They sure
seem to like it, Nanny.

10:59.580 --> 11:04.170
That's why we're giving our
little heroes and unlimited
supply of Any Mutt.

11:04.170 --> 11:07.120
Any Mutt?

11:07.120 --> 11:08.330
This is Any Mutt?

11:09.830 --> 11:11.040
Mmm.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.210
Why didn't we
try this sooner?

11:13.210 --> 11:17.250
I told you guys not to be
afraid to try new things.

11:18.330 --> 11:20.330
I think I finally
got it right, Jasper.

11:20.330 --> 11:21.750
Listen, this is a stickup.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.250
Fork over the money.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.670
Too late for that, Horace.

11:24.670 --> 11:26.000
Try this one.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.330
Help! We're trapped
in a storeroom!

11:28.330 --> 11:31.330
Help! We're stored
in a trap room!

11:31.330 --> 11:32.380
Close.

11:32.380 --> 11:35.670
-Help! Help!
-Help! Help!

11:51.420 --> 11:52.710
Hmm?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.460
Mmm...

12:03.790 --> 12:07.460
-Come and get it!

12:24.620 --> 12:27.380
Hmm?

12:27.380 --> 12:30.460
Man:
Previously
on Thunderbolt PI...

12:36.120 --> 12:38.000
Cool! The season premiere!

12:41.120 --> 12:42.120
Aah!

12:43.420 --> 12:44.790
Hmm?

12:44.790 --> 12:47.250
Woman:
Tonight, Swami Deepsix Chara

12:47.250 --> 12:50.330
lectures on
finding your spot.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.420
Son, I know being part of
a big family can be tough,

12:58.420 --> 12:59.960
but look at it this way.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.210
You'll never be lonely,

13:01.210 --> 13:02.710
and we all love you.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.830
Dad, you got any idea
what it's like

13:04.830 --> 13:07.460
to have 98
brothers and sisters?

13:07.460 --> 13:10.040
Think ant colony.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.500
Lucky:
I want my own dish,
my own bed,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.460
and my own TV.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.830
I thought Lucky liked us.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.790
-Maybe we could--

13:18.790 --> 13:21.330
I'm sure if we asked them.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.380
What are you thinking?

13:22.380 --> 13:23.790
Yeah, what are you thinking?

13:23.790 --> 13:26.210
Well, maybe we can arrange

13:26.210 --> 13:28.620
for him to spend the summer
with Aunt Coco and Uncle Beamer?

13:28.620 --> 13:30.330
Of course.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.330
The Vandercreams.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.830
Wahoo!

13:33.830 --> 13:35.880
Make my reservations!

13:37.290 --> 13:39.000
He's leaving us.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.580
I'll keep an eye on him,
ma'am, don't you worry.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.210
Thank you.

13:46.210 --> 13:49.210
Now I want you to be
a good boy while you're
with your aunt and uncle.

13:50.670 --> 13:52.210
I'm gonna miss you, man.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.460
I need closure, Lucky.

13:59.620 --> 14:01.790
The remote is yours.

14:01.790 --> 14:04.170
Fly free, my eagle!

14:04.170 --> 14:06.000
Up you go.

14:10.210 --> 14:11.750
You sure this is gonna work?

14:11.750 --> 14:13.670
Perdita:
If I know the Vandercreams.

14:17.750 --> 14:20.170
This is cool!

14:20.170 --> 14:23.040
Well, reckon this is
where you get off, kid.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.460
You be careful.

14:24.460 --> 14:26.120
Oh, I'll be fine.

14:29.210 --> 14:31.620
-You must be Lucky.
-You must be Lucky.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.460
Yes. And you must be...

14:34.460 --> 14:36.250
She's Aunt Coco.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.830
He's Uncle Beamer.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.380
-We're the Vandercreams.
-We're the Vandercreams.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.040
Welcome to our
little home.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.290
Wow!

14:44.290 --> 14:45.790
Ahem.

14:45.790 --> 14:47.670
Another for dinner?

14:47.670 --> 14:49.120
Very good.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.620
Gielgud's ever
so well trained.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.880
He does everything.

14:58.250 --> 15:01.290
You mean we're allowed
on the furniture?

15:01.290 --> 15:02.750
Of course.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.290
Eating on the floor
is très gauche.

15:08.250 --> 15:11.750
Gielgud makes the best
kibble cocktails.

15:13.540 --> 15:15.210
Mmm!

15:22.250 --> 15:23.330
I'm sorry.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.380
I'm so used
to eating out of the trough.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.620
They fed you
from a trough?

15:27.620 --> 15:29.120
Outside?

15:29.120 --> 15:31.420
With a jillion
brothers and sisters.

15:31.420 --> 15:34.960
Farm damage.
I hope we're not too late.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.290
Are we finished?

15:36.290 --> 15:37.620
May I be excused?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.830
No, you silly little bagel.

15:39.830 --> 15:41.830
That was just
your first course.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.580
Somebody pinch me!

15:55.120 --> 15:57.170
This is your room.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.920
I get to stay in here?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.500
All by myself?!

16:04.500 --> 16:06.500
It's all yours, cookie.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.170
Too cool!

16:08.170 --> 16:09.420
Whoopee!

16:12.080 --> 16:14.250
This is the best
day of my life.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.960
Ugh. I can't sleep.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.880
Something's missing.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.750
Wonder if he misses us?

16:32.920 --> 16:35.540
Woman:
Tonight on
the Inner Peace Channel,

16:35.540 --> 16:38.040
the joys of solitude.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.330
I wonder if Cadpig's watching?

16:40.330 --> 16:42.960
Oh, Lucky, come on, quickly!

16:42.960 --> 16:44.080
What's going on?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.580
-It's for you.

16:45.580 --> 16:49.120
From Pongo and Perdy
at the Dearly farm.

16:49.120 --> 16:53.120
To Lucky
at the Vandercreams.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.540
They want to know
how you are?

16:55.540 --> 17:00.040
Tell 'em I-- Tell 'em
I'm having a great time.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.000
Sounds like he's
having the time of his life.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.080
Huh.

17:07.080 --> 17:10.170
I thought for sure
he'd be ready to come
home by now.

17:10.170 --> 17:13.620
Just give him
a little more time.

17:13.620 --> 17:15.120
I feared this.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.330
He's gone material on us.

17:17.330 --> 17:18.830
Do you think
he'll come back?

17:18.830 --> 17:21.960
Come on! What have they got
that we ain't got?

17:21.960 --> 17:24.040
There's food,
there's comfort,

17:24.040 --> 17:26.500
indulgence, there's food,

17:26.500 --> 17:28.210
and there's food.

17:28.210 --> 17:29.540
Oh...

17:32.290 --> 17:35.000
I'm gaining on ya!

17:36.620 --> 17:38.290
Coco:
Come along, cupcake.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.000
We're going out.

17:41.790 --> 17:42.960
Okay.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.710
What's your hurry, trooper?

17:46.710 --> 17:49.960
This is the way well-bred
dogs go for a walk.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.500
You'll be so pleased.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.000
We made a playdate.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.040
At the dog park.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.540
A park

18:00.540 --> 18:03.250
For our kind of dogs.

18:11.710 --> 18:14.540
Hello, you with the dots.

18:14.540 --> 18:17.920
I am Sha-sha,
and this is Clyde.

18:17.920 --> 18:18.920
We're your date.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.120
Lose the pet, won't you?

18:23.460 --> 18:24.670
Name's Lucky.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.170
What do you want
to do, dig holes?

18:26.170 --> 18:28.080
Hard on the manicure.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.120
Chase squirrels?

18:29.120 --> 18:31.670
Ugh. Beneath our
dignity, I'd say.

18:31.670 --> 18:34.460
Nobody here does that
sort of thing anymore.

18:34.460 --> 18:37.290
So what do you
do for fun?

18:37.290 --> 18:40.330
Well, let's play disc toss
with your pet.

18:40.330 --> 18:41.750
Okay.

18:45.170 --> 18:46.620
Very good, sir.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.830
What do you think
you're doing?

18:51.830 --> 18:53.040
I'm going after it.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.960
What a rustic.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.210
He's never played fetch before.

18:57.210 --> 18:58.500
It's too funny.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.580
So, what am I supposed to do?

19:00.580 --> 19:02.380
Watch and learn.

19:02.380 --> 19:03.540
Jethro.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.210
Another round, sir?

19:09.210 --> 19:10.880
Forget it.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.670
Not to your liking, sport?

19:29.670 --> 19:31.540
No, it's not that.

19:31.540 --> 19:34.960
Food just sort of reminds me
of someone back home.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.710
Try the chicken, sweet cake.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.460
That's even worse.

19:44.170 --> 19:45.960
Highlights coming up
in just a minute.

19:47.710 --> 19:49.960
All right! My dog!

19:58.000 --> 19:59.790
Ahem. Excuse me.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.790
Aunt Coco, Uncle Beamer?

20:01.790 --> 20:03.420
What is it, shortbread?

20:03.420 --> 20:05.460
I wondered if you wanted

20:05.460 --> 20:08.670
to watch Thunderbolt with me?
It's a real good one.

20:08.670 --> 20:11.920
If he isn't the cutest
little bumpkin.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.880
Thunderbolt is so
unpedigreed, darling.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.880
Beamer:
Next, he'll be wanting us
to watch a tractor pull.

20:24.170 --> 20:28.420
Man, even ol' Thunder's
no fun by myself.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.790
-Lucky!
-Lucky!

21:06.790 --> 21:08.460
Lucky!

21:08.460 --> 21:09.790
Lucky...

21:10.830 --> 21:12.920
-Lucky!
-Lucky!

21:12.920 --> 21:14.790
-Lucky!
-The bus!

21:14.790 --> 21:16.330
-Lucky!
-It's the bus!

21:16.330 --> 21:18.830
-Lucky!
-Lucky!

21:18.830 --> 21:20.620
Lucky!

21:24.920 --> 21:26.920
We've come
to take you home.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.330
It's so good to see you guys.

21:31.330 --> 21:32.920
Gracious!

21:32.920 --> 21:34.830
Oh, Beams.

21:34.830 --> 21:37.330
We gave him everything.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.960
Farm dogs.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.620
You did your best, darling.

21:41.620 --> 21:42.960
Lucky!

21:42.960 --> 21:44.710
Mwaah! Mwaah! Mwaah!

21:44.710 --> 21:46.540
Oh, we missed you,
little fella.

21:46.540 --> 21:48.420
I told 'em you'd
be b-b-b-b-back.

21:48.420 --> 21:51.290
Ah, Lucky, bro! All right!

21:51.290 --> 21:53.670
I really missed you guys.

21:53.670 --> 21:56.000
We missed you, too!

21:56.000 --> 21:59.670
Rolly:
Yeah. Nothing seemed
the same without you.

21:59.670 --> 22:02.830
You know, being away
made me realize

22:02.830 --> 22:05.670
just how important
you guys are to me.

22:05.670 --> 22:08.460
Come on, everybody.
Group hug!
