Previously on Marvel's Runaways...

00:11.649 --> 00:12.692
WOMAN:
It's time.

00:12.776 --> 00:15.405
ALEX:
What... is... happening?

00:15.489 --> 00:17.577
-Please, please. I'm afraid.
-Whatever happened...

00:18.161 --> 00:20.040
I think our parents killed that girl.

00:20.123 --> 00:21.919
LESLIE:
It worked. How do you feel?

00:22.002 --> 00:23.213
I feel fantastic.

00:23.296 --> 00:25.050
CHASE: Maybe the bracelet
is some kind of inhibitor.

00:25.133 --> 00:27.012
KAROLINA:
Which would explain why my mom

00:27.096 --> 00:28.683
never wanted me to take it off.

00:28.766 --> 00:31.647
You are the only other person
that staff will work for.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.651
Why don't you keep it
for the night. I trust you, Nico.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.197
MOLLY: I think there might be
something wrong with me.

00:36.865 --> 00:39.036
-Aah!
-Stop! Get away from her.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.790
Holy shit, it does what I say.

00:40.873 --> 00:42.126
Dad, don't!

-Please.

JONAH: I can't fully revive him
without a sacrifice.

00:49.348 --> 00:50.727
Is he gonna be OK?

00:50.810 --> 00:51.895
That's what we're all hoping for.

00:51.979 --> 00:54.150
Hi, Graciela. It's Dale and Stacey.

00:54.233 --> 00:56.237
We knew Molly would be home
from school by now,

00:56.321 --> 00:57.615
and we were just missing her.

00:57.699 --> 00:59.536
-She's not here.
-We trusted you with her.

00:59.619 --> 01:01.749
Yes, but I don't trust you.

01:01.832 --> 01:03.961
Your parents sent me this
just before they died.

01:04.045 --> 01:05.212
GRACIELA:
There's a Metrolink.

01:05.297 --> 01:07.343
Go down there
in the morning if you like.

01:07.426 --> 01:09.681
This was left specifically for me.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.392
Something important.

01:11.476 --> 01:13.898
Molly, since before you were born,
we've been a part

01:13.981 --> 01:15.275
of an organization called PRIDE.

01:15.359 --> 01:17.196
They're planning on
digging something up,

01:17.279 --> 01:19.618
something buried deep beneath the city.

01:19.701 --> 01:21.872
And even if what's down there is good--

01:21.955 --> 01:24.377
There's a blind fault.
and if we disturb it,

01:24.460 --> 01:26.840
it will cause a series
of seismic events--

01:26.924 --> 01:29.763
ALICE: Not to mention
we found some really weird stuff

01:29.846 --> 01:31.265
in these rock samples.

01:31.349 --> 01:34.230
Whatever's down there, it's alive.

01:34.313 --> 01:35.733
You gonna tell me what's going on
with that school

01:35.817 --> 01:36.819
and those crazy-ass friends of yours?

01:36.902 --> 01:39.115
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

01:39.198 --> 01:40.785
Then I guess we tight as hell.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.874
About time, I guess, since tonight
may be our last night on Earth.

01:43.958 --> 01:46.880
Well, if that's how it is,
I'd like one last dance.

01:46.964 --> 01:50.387
KAROLINA: I've just wanted
to do that for a really long time.

01:50.470 --> 01:52.433
We have to stop this.
No one else will.

01:52.517 --> 01:53.602
Time to come home, son.

01:53.686 --> 01:54.771
I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:54.855 --> 01:56.859
-We're a family.
-We're a family.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.863
And we'll fight you if we have to!

01:58.946 --> 02:00.533
I'm your father.

02:01.910 --> 02:03.121
Did you know about this?

02:03.204 --> 02:05.543
No, but it's what I was afraid of.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.755
GENE:
The point is, if you're watching this,

02:07.839 --> 02:09.049
we failed to stop it.

02:12.891 --> 02:15.020
WOMAN ON TV: She has fallen in
with a group of teenagers

02:15.103 --> 02:18.276
that are persons of interest
in the death of Destiny Gonzales.

02:18.359 --> 02:22.367
Anyone with news regarding this case
should contact the police immediately.

MAN: Are you happy
you have the kids back?

02:44.996 --> 02:46.625
WOMAN: Did you think
you'd get them back so soon?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.419
MAN: Mrs. Wilder!
Have you talked to them yet?

02:48.504 --> 02:50.591
MAN 2:
One statement!

02:50.675 --> 02:52.302
Mr. Dean, please!

02:54.891 --> 02:58.607
We'd like to thank you
and the city for your support.

02:58.691 --> 03:00.736
As for questions regarding
our children and their safety--

03:00.820 --> 03:03.324
Come on, honey. We can talk
to the press after we see our daughter.

03:03.408 --> 03:04.410
[camera shutters click]

03:04.493 --> 03:06.957
And that is why Frank
will never be a member of PRIDE.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.128
I knew they wouldn't get far for long.

03:09.211 --> 03:11.090
They have no idea how
to survive on the streets.

03:11.173 --> 03:12.969
No wonder it took them
so long to run away.

03:13.052 --> 03:14.890
We're still waiting for your apology.

03:14.973 --> 03:17.185
You called the cops on our kids
and made 'em fugitives.

03:17.269 --> 03:20.526
Yeah, my son's face has been plastered
across every screen in the city.

03:20.610 --> 03:23.699
Which is why they've
been found... 24 hours later.

03:23.782 --> 03:26.287
Don't bother, Cat.
Haters gonna hate.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.713
Detective Flores.
Thank you for your assistance.

03:30.796 --> 03:33.636
Just got here myself.
Came as soon as I received the call.

03:33.719 --> 03:35.180
They're being held back here.

03:35.263 --> 03:37.267
ROBERT: I just can't believe
you found 'em so quickly.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.650
We launched a citywide manhunt,
pulled out all the stops.

03:40.733 --> 03:42.570
My men said they'd split up.

03:42.654 --> 03:45.116
Really? That seems strange.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.164
FLORES: Makes sense.
Harder to find them that way.

03:48.247 --> 03:49.542
Wait. What are you gonna say
when you see them?

03:49.626 --> 03:50.920
Nothing. I just wanna hug them.

03:52.339 --> 03:54.636
FLORES:
Kids, your parents are here.

04:01.273 --> 04:02.944
FRANK:
Oh, shit.

04:03.737 --> 04:05.574
GEOFFREY:
You gotta be kidding me.

04:05.658 --> 04:07.912
DALE:
Uh, those aren't our kids.

04:07.995 --> 04:09.206
For Christ's sakes, Flores.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.003
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

04:12.087 --> 04:13.172
My men assured me--

04:13.256 --> 04:15.803
Maybe you need more
than just men handling your shit.

04:15.886 --> 04:18.307
Don't call till you actually have them.

04:21.397 --> 04:23.067
This means our kids are still running.

[rock music]

04:32.670 --> 04:34.507
-Stop, please!
-Give those back!

04:42.899 --> 04:44.068
How did he even get them?

04:44.151 --> 04:45.863
Chase was supposed to be on lookout!

04:45.946 --> 04:47.950
Yeah, I only dozed off for,
like, five minutes.

04:48.034 --> 04:49.203
Gert, hurry!

04:49.286 --> 04:51.625
Yeah, you're not the one

Get away from the street.

I thought you said they don't work.

05:39.512 --> 05:40.723

With... tinkering.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.770
Wait, did he take anything else?

05:43.854 --> 05:44.856
Alex, you still have the money?

05:44.939 --> 05:48.237
Please. Think I'd allow myself
to get robbed blind like Chase?

05:49.323 --> 05:51.661
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:51.745 --> 05:53.331
[patting pockets]

05:54.374 --> 05:56.128
-It's gone.
-Way to go, Wilder.

05:56.212 --> 05:57.339
You were supposed to be on lookout.

05:57.422 --> 05:59.092
Well, what are we supposed to do now?
Someone might have seen us.

05:59.176 --> 06:01.681
-I'm so hungry I can't think.
-Except we have no money.

06:01.765 --> 06:03.518
Then we find somewhere
that we can eat for free.

06:03.602 --> 06:05.981
Whatever we do, we gotta
do it quick, guys. We gotta go.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.818
We're not going anywhere.
This wheel's busted.

06:08.820 --> 06:09.906

is chilling in a Dumpster,

07:55.826 --> 07:57.788

KAROLINA: This place is paid for
by our parents?

08:21.711 --> 08:23.590
We can't eat that soup.

08:23.673 --> 08:25.218
Nico's right. It's PRIDE soup.

08:25.301 --> 08:27.013
Soup is soup, and I'm starving.

08:27.096 --> 08:29.226
Soup in and of itself
has no inherent morality.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.520
Neither do our parents.

08:30.604 --> 08:33.652
Whether it's good soup or bad soup,
it is hot soup, and we are starving.

08:33.735 --> 08:35.279
Can everyone stop saying "soup"?

08:35.363 --> 08:38.870
Look, it's not like our parents
are gonna be popping by.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.960
They just write checks. They don't
give a shit about the homeless.

08:43.630 --> 08:45.634
OK, grab your food
and sit at different tables.

08:45.717 --> 08:47.555
We might not be as noticeable
if we split up.

08:47.638 --> 08:49.684
No way. Strength in numbers.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.646
Everyone just eat as fast as they can.

08:51.729 --> 08:53.440
Won't be a problem.

CHASE: You OK?

09:07.176 --> 09:10.391
Oh. So many with so little.

09:11.519 --> 09:12.730
CHASE:
You seem surprised.

09:12.813 --> 09:15.652
I mean, you were Brentwood's
fiercest social justice warrior.

09:16.613 --> 09:18.324
Yeah.

09:18.407 --> 09:21.831
Guess I just never really
seen social injustice in person before.

09:25.839 --> 09:27.008
Come on.

09:30.974 --> 09:32.310
This is so good.

09:32.393 --> 09:33.688
Finish up. We should move.

09:33.772 --> 09:36.443
Where? Between PRIDE
and the Church, the streets aren't safe.

09:36.527 --> 09:39.032
-We have to stay hidden.
-We need a tent.

09:39.115 --> 09:40.493
Which we can't buy
since Alex lost the money.

09:40.577 --> 09:43.207
ALEX: OK, forgetting for a moment
that you were supposed to be on lookout,

09:43.290 --> 09:45.837
how about the fact that I got us
the money to begin with?

09:45.921 --> 09:48.677
OK? Maybe... you all could
show a little gratitude.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.681
Maybe if you told us
where you got the money.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.976
I can't, OK? It's for your protection.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.396
NICO:
Or yours.

09:54.479 --> 09:56.274
How do we know your parents
didn't give it to you?

09:58.195 --> 09:59.447
You think I'm a mole?

10:02.663 --> 10:04.583
CHASE:
Nobody knows what to think,

10:04.667 --> 10:06.546
other than when Karolina
was taken by Jonah

10:06.629 --> 10:08.173
you voted to leave her behind.

10:08.257 --> 10:10.469
You are never gonna let that go, are you?

10:10.929 --> 10:12.891
Karolina, I was always
gonna come back for you.

10:12.975 --> 10:14.394
I'm sure you had your reasons.

10:14.477 --> 10:16.022
I'm sure they had nothing to do
with the fact

10:16.106 --> 10:18.360
that Karolina and Nico
developed a certain chemistry.

10:18.444 --> 10:20.949
I wasn't aware of that at the time, OK?

10:21.032 --> 10:24.874
And I'm still trying to process
that information, actually.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.836
But thanks for bringing it up, though.

10:26.919 --> 10:29.592
So, if you weren't motivated
by jealousy, then what?

10:29.675 --> 10:32.430
You're just a terrible leader who makes
bad decisions under pressure?

10:32.514 --> 10:34.977
ALEX:
Welcome to lead anytime, Chase.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.733
But since you're incapable
of coming up with an idea

10:37.816 --> 10:40.906
that doesn't suck,
I'll handle it. Again.

10:41.490 --> 10:43.494
[sighs] There's an encampment
off the river

10:43.578 --> 10:45.916
east of the underpass
that we stayed at last night.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.961
-I'll meet you guys there.
-Alex, where are you going?

10:48.045 --> 10:50.466
I told you,
you have to trust me.

10:52.178 --> 10:53.263
Thanks.

10:56.521 --> 10:58.566
WOMAN ON TV:
I'm here at the home of Graciela Aguirre,

10:58.650 --> 11:00.570
a distant relative of Molly Hernandez,

11:00.654 --> 11:03.200
who was allegedly abducted
from her home.

11:03.283 --> 11:07.458
Ms. Aguirre, any comment on the fact
that Molly Hernandez was taken

11:07.543 --> 11:09.045
from your home by children of PRIDE?

11:09.128 --> 11:12.176
GRACIELA: Not sure where the idea
that Molly was abducted came from.

11:12.260 --> 11:13.596
I never reported it.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.936
And it's not the children of PRIDE
the media should be looking into.

11:17.019 --> 11:18.272
It's their parents.

11:19.733 --> 11:22.363
The leaders of PRIDE are
highly accomplished professionals,

11:22.446 --> 11:25.286
not to mention what their philanthropy
has done for the city.

11:25.662 --> 11:28.333
Trust me... I've seen proof.

11:29.168 --> 11:31.381
What-what proof is she talking about?

11:32.968 --> 11:36.976
I may have sent Graciela the VHS tape
my parents made me,

11:37.059 --> 11:39.899
the one with warning about California
breaking off into the ocean.

11:41.276 --> 11:43.698
If something happened to us,
someone should know the truth.

11:43.781 --> 11:46.077
Yeah, and now she does,
but she's in danger.

11:46.161 --> 11:47.163
She said it on TV.

11:47.246 --> 11:50.252
Yeah. She knows all about
a conspiracy to cause an earthquake,

11:50.336 --> 11:53.008
but... she has no idea about Jonah.

11:53.091 --> 11:54.678
And that our parents are killers.

11:54.762 --> 11:56.222
We have to warn her.

12:03.445 --> 12:04.657
Did you see...

12:08.455 --> 12:09.708
[chatter]

12:10.167 --> 12:12.714
-What are they doing here?
-I figured they forgot about this place.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.971
[chatter stops]

12:18.601 --> 12:22.066
On behalf of all of us,
we're so sorry to hear about your kids.

12:22.149 --> 12:23.820
And we appreciate that,

12:23.903 --> 12:26.951
but what you've heard is nothing
but a big misunderstanding.

12:27.744 --> 12:30.374
Our children may be runaways,
but they're not criminals.

12:30.457 --> 12:33.171
JANET: This will all be cleared up
when they're back home and safe.

12:33.255 --> 12:36.554
The good work we've all performed
for homeless children city-wide

12:36.637 --> 12:38.599
means we've banked some good karma.

12:38.683 --> 12:41.814
CATHERINE: In the meantime,
we will not let our personal situation

12:41.897 --> 12:43.818
stand in the way of our mission.

12:43.901 --> 12:45.655
Yeah. If anything,
what we're facing has made us

12:45.739 --> 12:48.493
even more committed
to PRIDE's cause.

12:50.372 --> 12:52.544
[applause continues]

12:58.221 --> 13:00.142
-[door closes]
-Think they bought it?

13:00.225 --> 13:01.269
DALE: I did.

13:01.352 --> 13:04.067
Anyone else notice our wives
are really good at lying?

13:04.150 --> 13:05.570
We sure it's safe to meet here?

13:05.653 --> 13:07.448
To the public, it's business as usual,

13:07.532 --> 13:11.372
but I designed this room
with certain enhancements...

13:11.456 --> 13:12.793
should the day come.

13:12.876 --> 13:13.836
[scanner beeps]

13:17.511 --> 13:19.515
[clicking, whirring]

13:24.482 --> 13:26.027
DALE:
A secret antechamber.

13:27.488 --> 13:29.200
Classic PRIDE.

13:32.123 --> 13:35.713
TINA: Robert and I had
Wizard's best techs wire this place.

13:35.797 --> 13:38.553
It's a 24-hour surveillance center

13:38.636 --> 13:41.141
with CCTV from across the city

13:41.224 --> 13:45.065
interfacing with Wizard's state-of-
the-art facial recognition software.

13:46.317 --> 13:47.571
ROBERT:
Designed by me.

13:48.238 --> 13:50.618
We're in charge
of getting our kids back now.

13:50.702 --> 13:52.288
This is now PRIDE's central command,

13:52.371 --> 13:56.087
where we share everything we learn
and keep it off the radar of the cops,

13:56.170 --> 13:59.720
the media,
and most importantly, Jonah.

14:04.646 --> 14:07.151
As I've said...

14:07.234 --> 14:09.405
I want to hurt him
as much as the rest of you do.

14:10.324 --> 14:11.827
Not possible.

14:12.453 --> 14:15.125
I wasn't the one who went
to the police behind our backs.

14:15.208 --> 14:16.837
GEOFFREY:
I've heard enough about that.

14:16.921 --> 14:19.551
TINA: You know what I
would like to hear more about?

14:19.635 --> 14:22.807
Graciela Aguirre.
Presume everyone saw the news?

14:24.268 --> 14:27.984
She said she has proof that PRIDE
is behind Molly's disappearance.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.988
-You told us she was a distant relative...
-[Dale clears throat]

14:30.072 --> 14:31.951
...she lived alone
and went to church.

14:32.034 --> 14:34.330
-We may have underestimated her...
-She's feisty.

14:34.413 --> 14:38.213
...and not the most trusting soul,
especially when it comes to us.

14:38.296 --> 14:39.758
Sounds like more loose ends.

14:39.841 --> 14:42.096
Someone needs to pay Graciela a visit.

14:42.179 --> 14:44.518
Find out what she knows.
Make sure no one else learns it.

14:44.601 --> 14:45.937
Gimme me an address.

14:46.020 --> 14:48.400
-I'll deal with it.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:48.483 --> 14:49.611
Pump the brakes there, big guy.

14:49.695 --> 14:51.239
Haven't enough
innocent people died?

14:51.322 --> 14:52.534
Wouldn't it be great
if we could, just, you know,

14:52.617 --> 14:55.205
dial down the murdering, just a little?

14:55.288 --> 14:57.711
Need we remind you
of the mindwipe drug we created

14:57.794 --> 14:58.796
for just such an occasion?

14:58.879 --> 15:01.175
Yes, and we have made
significant improvements...

15:01.259 --> 15:02.261
Tremendous.

15:02.344 --> 15:03.346
...since it was first used
on Frank Dean.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.977
Yes. Big improvements.

15:06.060 --> 15:07.062
Yeah.

15:07.146 --> 15:08.983
Fine.

15:09.066 --> 15:11.279
But Robert and I
are coming with you.

15:11.362 --> 15:14.828
It's not that we don't trust you,
but... we don't.

15:41.297 --> 15:42.466
[Alex sighs]

15:42.550 --> 15:44.470
Must be out of my damn mind meeting you.

15:44.554 --> 15:46.349
Shit's been on the news nonstop.

15:46.432 --> 15:48.979
I'm aware. Thanks for coming.

15:49.063 --> 15:50.065
Hey...

15:50.148 --> 15:53.363
every day you survive out there,
it's another day your dad suffers.

15:53.446 --> 15:55.075
I'm good with that.

15:56.703 --> 15:58.874
OK, I wouldn't have called
if it wasn't an emergency,

15:58.958 --> 16:00.711
all right, but...

16:00.795 --> 16:03.174
[sighs]
we need more money.

16:03.258 --> 16:07.141
What? You already spent
the fifteen hundred I gave you?

16:07.224 --> 16:08.936
What, you've been posting
up at the Four Seasons?

16:09.019 --> 16:11.149
-We got robbed.
-That's why I gave you a gun.

16:11.232 --> 16:15.115
Damn, man. Parents
raised you soft in Brentwood.

16:15.198 --> 16:18.413
Please. I can't go back
to my friends empty-handed.

16:18.496 --> 16:19.958
They're counting on me.

16:20.041 --> 16:21.419
I'll do anything.

16:22.505 --> 16:24.091
[soft chuckle]

16:24.175 --> 16:25.678
OK, little homie.

16:27.014 --> 16:29.310
But you want more?

16:29.393 --> 16:31.648
This time you've gotta earn it.

16:32.609 --> 16:34.153
And you not gon' like it.

16:43.756 --> 16:46.052
[helicopter passes overhead]

16:47.012 --> 16:49.851
So how do we get to Graciela's?
She lives, like, 20 miles away.

16:49.935 --> 16:51.939
Uh, yeah.
Remember when life was so easy,

16:52.022 --> 16:55.655
like, 48 hours ago when we all had
cell phones and Lyft accounts?

16:55.738 --> 16:58.535
-Do payphones still exist?
-Even if they did, they require payment.

16:58.619 --> 17:01.499
-We could take the Metrolink.
-Public transportation?

17:01.583 --> 17:02.794
Does anybody even know
how to do that?

17:02.877 --> 17:05.590
I do. That's how I got to school
from Graciela's. I still have my card.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.219
You take the Purple line to the Red line,

17:07.301 --> 17:10.685
then you transfer to the Yellow line,
then there's another Red one--

17:10.768 --> 17:12.855
the last two are buses, not trains.

17:12.939 --> 17:14.275
Only we would do it backwards,

17:14.358 --> 17:15.736
because we're going
the opposite direction.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.699
-But there's one problem.
-KAROLINA: Only one?

17:17.781 --> 17:19.953
The train runs
only during rush hour.

17:20.788 --> 17:23.459
-Which is hours from now.
-And too late for Graciela.

17:25.506 --> 17:28.804
Of course, the d-bag who owns that car
could go wherever he wants.

17:30.766 --> 17:33.313
[indistinct chatter]

17:36.277 --> 17:39.074
Yes. Yes... he can.

17:44.168 --> 17:45.504
Today.

17:46.339 --> 17:48.384
Why do you think they're
called time shares, bro?

17:50.013 --> 17:51.349
VALET:
Range Rover.

17:51.432 --> 17:52.810
CHASE:
Babe, I was not flirting with that girl.

17:52.894 --> 17:54.898
KAROLINA:
Babe, you so were. You're a giant dick.

17:54.981 --> 17:56.735
-No, I'm not. I was being nice!

17:56.818 --> 17:58.071
That's the opposite of a giant dick.

17:58.154 --> 17:59.532
-Keys.
-Oh, yeah. Were you being nice

17:59.616 --> 18:01.160
when you banged my roommate?

18:01.243 --> 18:03.206
That's right. You're a giant dick.

18:09.093 --> 18:11.430
[man chatters on phone]

18:12.892 --> 18:14.979
-Pretty white privilege for the win.
-Yeah.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.882
[clears throat]

18:31.303 --> 18:32.557
You still got that piece I gave you?

18:32.640 --> 18:36.021
Yeah. [sighs]

18:36.105 --> 18:39.319
Hold it right,
as if you were gonna use it.

18:43.704 --> 18:44.873
Gimme.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.837
ALEX:
What the hell?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.507
Oh, you thought I gave that to you?

18:49.591 --> 18:51.302
More like loaned it...

18:51.385 --> 18:53.766
long enough to make sure
your Wilder DNA is all over it.

18:54.559 --> 18:57.022
You don't know what's been
done with it, but I do...

18:57.105 --> 18:58.274
and it's on you now.

18:58.357 --> 19:00.278
You're framing me?

19:00.361 --> 19:01.405
Hold up.

19:02.950 --> 19:04.746
We're still friends.

19:04.829 --> 19:08.252
Just... given your lineage, I...

19:08.336 --> 19:10.633
need an insurance policy
to make sure we stay that way.

19:12.093 --> 19:14.974
Also, you ain't safe with that thing.

19:15.058 --> 19:16.853
Cop sees you with it,
you're shot in the head.

19:21.655 --> 19:23.324
Come on. Let's go.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.714
Respect yourself, protect yourself.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.887
Can't mess up that fine outfit.

19:33.971 --> 19:35.473
It's actually from a thrift store.

19:35.558 --> 19:37.687
Uh, not that it really matters.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.607
I'm just-- I don't know,

19:39.691 --> 19:42.487
I'm getting a really bad feeling
about what's up these stairs

19:42.572 --> 19:45.536
and what you expect me to do
once we get to the top.

19:46.788 --> 19:47.957
Stop.

19:49.251 --> 19:51.255
First time is never easy...

19:54.303 --> 19:56.473
...but you'll be a man after this.

19:57.518 --> 19:58.770
[exhales]

20:06.578 --> 20:08.624
At least give me back the gun.

20:10.878 --> 20:11.922
[hinges creak]

20:22.025 --> 20:24.488
I'm thinkin' a seafoam green.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.916
You wanted me to paint?

20:29.999 --> 20:32.588
[laughs] Man, what the hell
did you think?

20:33.339 --> 20:35.511
You watch too many Tarantino movies.

20:35.594 --> 20:36.846
Scorsese and shit.

20:36.930 --> 20:39.267
-Not even remotely funny.

20:39.351 --> 20:41.188
It is to me.
Now get to it.

20:42.858 --> 20:44.821
Baby's due in two weeks.

20:45.488 --> 20:47.075
It's gonna be a boy.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.381
You must be hungry,
coming all this way to visit me.

20:54.464 --> 20:57.178
-Oh. Wow. Isn't that nice, sweetie?
-[laughs nervously]

20:57.262 --> 20:59.642
Look at all those little cookies.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.355
-Mm.
-¡Sabrosos! [chuckles]

21:02.439 --> 21:03.775
We honeymooned in Zihuat.

21:03.859 --> 21:05.194
-Sí, sí.
-He just loves local cultures.

21:05.278 --> 21:07.198
Well, claro que.

21:07.282 --> 21:08.785
Now, what do you want?

21:09.537 --> 21:12.459
Well, Graciela, we're just--

21:13.377 --> 21:14.630
we're very worried about...

21:14.714 --> 21:15.758
-Molly.
-Molly.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.304
Um, we--
how she is, where she is...

21:18.387 --> 21:21.018
I told Detective Flores
everything I knew, which is nothing.

21:21.101 --> 21:23.857
And yet you do seem
to know something.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.778
Uh, yeah, about us or about PRIDE--

21:25.861 --> 21:27.948
Graciela, I'm just gonna cut
straight to the point.

21:28.032 --> 21:31.288
Now, despite serving
some very nice pan dulces...

21:31.371 --> 21:32.499
[nervous laughter]

21:32.583 --> 21:34.002
...you obviously don't like us
very much, and--

21:34.086 --> 21:36.215
A part of that could just
be our personalities, but--

21:36.298 --> 21:38.512
You saw the news,
and you want to know

21:38.595 --> 21:40.849
what's on that tape
from the Hernandezes.

21:42.812 --> 21:43.980
Yes. The tape.

21:44.064 --> 21:45.233
I'll get it for you.

21:45.316 --> 21:47.028
I suppose it's only right
that you know the truth.

21:47.112 --> 21:50.911
-Yes. The truth is always right.
-Sí. Entendió.

21:50.994 --> 21:52.748
-DALE: Yes...
-Yes. I'll be back.

21:52.832 --> 21:56.506
¡La verdad! [chuckles]

21:56.589 --> 21:57.675
-There's a tape...
-There's a tape.

21:57.758 --> 21:58.927
-...and we're gonna get it...
-OK.

21:59.010 --> 22:00.263
-...and then we will jab her.
-Oh, yeah.

22:00.346 --> 22:01.975
It'll be like we were never here,

22:02.058 --> 22:04.020
and she never saw any tape, right?

22:05.231 --> 22:06.233
-Hon?
-What?

22:06.316 --> 22:07.443
-Maybe I should do the jabbing.
-What?

22:07.528 --> 22:08.613
We never really discussed
who was gonna jab.

22:08.697 --> 22:10.032
No, no, no, no, no.
You go for the tape.

22:10.116 --> 22:11.160
-I know...
-I'll sneak up beside her,

22:11.243 --> 22:12.997
-and I'll just give her the business.
-[cocks pistol]

22:13.080 --> 22:15.878
-Oh, Jesus!
-Oh!

22:15.961 --> 22:17.673
Graciela's a Bond Villain.

22:18.758 --> 22:22.265
You want the tape?
Here it is.

22:22.348 --> 22:23.977
[Yorkes both shouting]

22:24.060 --> 22:26.064
[grunts]

22:26.148 --> 22:28.402
GRACIELA:
You wanna be next?

22:29.697 --> 22:31.408
[both panting]

22:31.491 --> 22:33.370
The hunters have become the hunted!
[laughs]

22:33.788 --> 22:36.136
STACEY:
OK, where's the serum?
Where's the serum?

22:36.220 --> 22:37.546
You have to jab her.
You have to jab her.

22:37.630 --> 22:38.840
In the leg or the foot
or something.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.259
So she can forget
how to shoot that thing?

22:40.343 --> 22:42.472
-Yeah!
-Besides, I-- I kinda dropped it.

22:42.556 --> 22:44.351
-STACEY: What? What?!
-DALE: I'm sorry!

22:44.434 --> 22:46.773
-[explosive sound]
-[wind whooshing]

22:46.856 --> 22:48.150
STACY: Oh!

22:48.234 --> 22:51.365
-You want me to shoot you, too?
-Choke.

22:54.538 --> 22:56.876
[grunting, whimpering]

22:56.960 --> 22:58.630
[whooshing continues]

23:03.974 --> 23:06.688
[Graciela continues choking]

23:10.403 --> 23:12.156
[wind chimes tinkling]

23:15.747 --> 23:17.208
[engine revving]

23:17.292 --> 23:19.004
[tires squeal]

23:23.429 --> 23:25.976
Molly. Wait, what if
our parents are in there?

23:31.821 --> 23:34.367
-[doorbell rings]
-Graciela?

23:35.453 --> 23:37.750
-[banging on door]
-Graciela?

23:39.670 --> 23:41.340
MOLLY:
Graciela!
