"Together Breakfast"

00:07.920 --> 00:08.750
Everyone's out.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.900
Guess I'm making us breakfast.

00:24.980 --> 00:28.090
Pearl! Garnet! Amethyst!

00:28.510 --> 00:29.580
Is anyone home?

00:40.120 --> 00:42.960
One, two, three... warp in!

00:46.220 --> 00:47.990
Guess they're still
out saving the world.

00:53.830 --> 00:56.740
Look at you. You are out of control.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.770
Pearl! Garnet!

01:10.540 --> 01:12.170
It's done!

01:16.640 --> 01:18.760
That thing's too good
for me to eat alone.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.550
It's a... together breakfast.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.390
Ah, Garnet! Perfect. Check it out.

01:30.620 --> 01:33.910
It's not exactly healthy,
but it's in a stack,

01:33.980 --> 01:39.340
so I guess you could say it's
a... balanced breakfast.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.530
You know, like,
I made us all breakfast.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.930
I thought we could eat
together like - like best buds.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.830
I can't stay. There's a business
to attend to inside the temple.

01:59.210 --> 02:01.270
Aw, business? Like what?

02:01.900 --> 02:03.170
I have to burn this.

02:07.820 --> 02:08.900
Cool!

02:10.840 --> 02:12.470
I have to burn this too.

02:14.330 --> 02:15.880
No! My apps!

02:16.960 --> 02:19.970
Door. Open door.

02:22.820 --> 02:24.970
Aw, you never work when I need it.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.080
Dumb police!

02:27.900 --> 02:28.830
You are dumb!

02:30.410 --> 02:35.580
Nooooooooooo!

02:37.800 --> 02:40.370
Oh, man. I totally got you.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.590
You should have seen
the look on your face.

02:42.650 --> 02:44.200
Oh, I knew it was you.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.380
How?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.760
'Cause that's a water gun,
and I'm not dumb.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.670
You got something on your shirt.

02:51.790 --> 02:53.980
Duuuuuh-umb.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.180
Hey! That's my door.

03:08.650 --> 03:10.860
Oh, Amethyst, there you are.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.640
Care to explain what one of my
swords was doing in your room?

03:14.840 --> 03:17.380
Having a sword party.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.430
Oh, please. You took it.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.480
I did not.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.310
It's fine. It's in the
past. I forgive you.

03:24.590 --> 03:27.450
Also, I cleaned up your awful,
awful mess. You're welcome.

03:27.650 --> 03:30.180
You did WHAT? I have a system.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.480
Amethyst! Wait!

03:32.970 --> 03:34.210
What's the matter, Steven?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.690
I wanted us all to have
breakfast together,

03:37.030 --> 03:40.580
so I made Together Breakfast,
but everyone keeps leaving.

03:40.790 --> 03:41.880
Oh, that's nice.

03:47.610 --> 03:49.540
Oh, no! Not you too!

03:50.130 --> 03:52.110
I can't let this become
together brunch.

04:11.170 --> 04:12.150
There we go.

04:19.310 --> 04:20.740
Hey, Pearl!

04:21.430 --> 04:23.870
Steven! What are you doing in here?

04:24.030 --> 04:26.310
You know it's dangerous
for you inside the temple.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.810
We're gonna have a
nice together breakfast,

04:30.020 --> 04:31.640
even if I have to get my shoes wet.

04:33.050 --> 04:35.680
What!? Get out of there!

04:35.880 --> 04:37.100
I'll swim it over to you.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.450
See? Doggy paddle, forward.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.430
Oh, gosh.

04:42.750 --> 04:46.670
Wait! Doggy paddle, reverse, reverse!

04:47.140 --> 04:48.240
Steven!

04:54.320 --> 04:55.120
What the...

05:07.320 --> 05:09.460
Keep it together, breakfast!

05:21.330 --> 05:22.240
Better.

05:22.570 --> 05:23.410
Amethyst.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.700
Oh, hey, Steven. Did you
come down the waterfall?

05:27.440 --> 05:29.910
Pearl gets so mad
that I have her junk,

05:29.910 --> 05:31.660
but it's always falling down here.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.000
Junk like what?

05:33.480 --> 05:37.510
Junk like... you! I'm gonna
throw you in the junk pile.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.390
Isn't it awful?

05:40.730 --> 05:42.180
Pearl organized everything.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.000
It still looks messy to me.

05:44.450 --> 05:46.600
Aw, thanks!
I try.

05:46.890 --> 05:47.760
Boom!

05:48.060 --> 05:49.660
Oh, what's that, Steven?

05:49.990 --> 05:51.530
It's a together breakfast.

05:51.660 --> 05:52.920
All right! Snacks!

05:53.130 --> 05:55.610
No! It's for everyone to eat together.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.850
That's the essence
of together breakfast.

06:00.930 --> 06:01.650
Give me! Give me!

06:05.640 --> 06:07.310
We have to eat it together!

06:22.220 --> 06:25.560
You can't outrun me!
We both have short legs.

06:30.900 --> 06:35.310
Steven. I'm hungry!

06:35.660 --> 06:37.640
Just hold on.

06:38.170 --> 06:40.550
An exit. Whoooo!

06:42.460 --> 06:43.240
Skills.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.810
Get back here.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.150
You're completely
missing the point of this.

06:51.230 --> 06:52.370
Hey, wait a second.

06:52.380 --> 06:54.490
Steven. There you are.

06:54.950 --> 06:56.870
Pearl, sweet. Two out of three.

06:59.220 --> 07:01.390
Steven, be careful.

07:01.530 --> 07:02.200
Why?

07:07.660 --> 07:11.730
You really shouldn't be in here.
This is the crystal heart. Oh!

07:11.990 --> 07:14.900
It's connected to the most
dangerous areas of the temple.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.800
Hold on tight and don't look down.

07:28.810 --> 07:31.240
Oh, hey. This isn't so bad.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.830
Never mind.

08:01.890 --> 08:04.080
Steven, we're getting you out of here.

08:04.270 --> 08:05.060
Come on.

08:05.060 --> 08:08.240
Huh? This is great!
We're all together!

08:10.110 --> 08:11.550
We can finally eat!

08:11.800 --> 08:14.920
I mean, we don't have any
forks, but we can use our hands.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.500
I'm not gonna judge.

08:17.270 --> 08:18.810
Steven, go!

08:19.280 --> 08:21.190
Ok. Want to meet in the kitchen?

08:27.970 --> 08:30.760
It's trying to escape.
Force it back.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.059
Get back!

08:42.960 --> 08:44.000
Steven!

08:51.180 --> 08:52.390
Together breakfast?

08:57.750 --> 08:59.810
It's taken refuge in organic matter.

09:01.030 --> 09:04.780
Now it has all the power of a
breakfast. We have to destroy it.

09:05.150 --> 09:07.230
Aah! It's horrible!

09:14.130 --> 09:19.370
I didn't want this. I just wanted to
eat together, like- like best buds.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.790
Steven, you've got to get away.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.460
But my breakfast.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.940
That's enough!

09:31.360 --> 09:37.710
I don't care if you... are the most
important meal of the day.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.300
I made you to bring us
together, not to tear us apart!

09:59.920 --> 10:03.370
I'm sorry, guys.
I guess I dreamed too big.

10:22.660 --> 10:26.710
It looks great. It's even more
together and even more breakfast.

10:39.850 --> 10:41.290
I don't think I can eat this.

10:41.650 --> 10:42.810
Let's order a pizza.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.120
- Pizza's a better idea
-Yeah

10:45.300 --> 10:45.910
Definitely.

10:46.610 --> 10:47.970
It did try to kill us.
