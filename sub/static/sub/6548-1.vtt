00:21.554 --> 00:25.547
<i>August, 1962</i>
<i>was a stormy time for France.</i>

00:26.234 --> 00:29.067
<i>Many people felt that</i>
<i>President Charles De Gaulle...</i>

00:29.154 --> 00:32.590
<i>... had betrayed the country</i>
<i>by giving independence to Algeria.</i>

00:33.474 --> 00:35.908
<i>Extremists, mostly from the army...</i>

00:36.074 --> 00:38.190
<i>... swore to kill him in revenge.</i>

00:38.874 --> 00:41.434
<i>They banded together</i>
<i>in an underground movement...</i>

00:41.634 --> 00:44.944
<i>... and called themselves the OAS.</i>

01:28.634 --> 01:30.989
The Minister's meeting is over!

04:36.354 --> 04:37.707
They're very late.

05:03.794 --> 05:08.390
<i>The time elapsed from the first</i>
<i>to the last shot was seven seconds.</i>

05:08.554 --> 05:12.388
<i>In all, more than 140 shots were fired.</i>

05:12.874 --> 05:15.388
<i>Several bullets pierced the President's car.</i>

05:15.474 --> 05:17.863
<i>One came within an inch of his head.</i>

05:17.954 --> 05:22.903
<i>But, as if by a miracle,</i>
<i>neither he nor anyone else was hurt.</i>

05:24.714 --> 05:26.067
<i>Six months later;</i>

05:27.194 --> 05:29.833
<i>Most of the conspirators</i>
<i>have been caught and tried.</i>

05:29.914 --> 05:33.543
<i>Their leader, Colonel Bastien-Thiry,</i>
<i>has been sentenced to death.</i>

05:33.634 --> 05:38.389
<i>At the last moment, his lawyer</i>
<i>tries one more time for a stay of execution.</i>

05:54.594 --> 05:57.267
The appeal for clemency
has been turned down.

05:57.354 --> 05:59.310
There is nothing more one can do.

05:59.554 --> 06:00.703
I am sorry.

06:01.514 --> 06:02.708
There is no need.

06:02.794 --> 06:06.150
For heaven's sake,
don't you realize you're going to be shot?

06:06.714 --> 06:08.067
You don't understand.

06:08.554 --> 06:11.830
No French soldier is going to raise
his rifle against me.

06:18.114 --> 06:19.467
Fire!

06:20.674 --> 06:24.792
<i>Here is the 8;00 news for today,</i>
<i>March 11, 1963.</i>

06:24.874 --> 06:28.469
<i>An hour ago, in the courtyard</i>
<i>of the Fort d'Ivry, outside Paris...</i>

06:28.914 --> 06:32.429
<i>... Lieutenant Colonel Bastien-Thiry</i>
<i>was executed by firing squad...</i>

06:32.514 --> 06:36.189
<i>... for leading the attempt on the life</i>
<i>of General De Gaulle last August.</i>

06:36.274 --> 06:38.504
<i>The OAS now seems</i>
<i>completely demoralized...</i>

06:38.634 --> 06:41.865
<i>... by the splendid performance</i>
<i>of our national security forces.</i>

06:42.074 --> 06:45.305
<i>Already it is known that</i>
<i>the new chief of operations of the OAS...</i>

06:45.434 --> 06:48.665
<i>... Colonel Mark Rodin, a former</i>
<i>paratroop commander in Algeria...</i>

06:48.954 --> 06:52.071
<i>... is on the run</i>
<i>and hiding somewhere in Austria.</i>

06:52.434 --> 06:55.790
<i>Today's execution must surely mean</i>
<i>that the OAS is finished...</i>

06:55.954 --> 06:57.433
<i>... once and for all.</i>

07:05.354 --> 07:07.584
What are the finances like, René?

07:09.234 --> 07:12.112
No wonder our people are giving up.
They've lost faith.

07:12.194 --> 07:13.991
We've failed them every single time.

07:14.074 --> 07:15.223
We won't fail again!

07:15.434 --> 07:17.152
What can we do? We're paralyzed.

07:17.234 --> 07:20.749
Every cop in France knows us.
Informants are all around us.

07:21.754 --> 07:24.268
We must find an outsider. A foreigner.

07:24.594 --> 07:27.392
- A foreigner? Why?
- A contract killer.

07:28.074 --> 07:31.384
One that hasn't worked in France,
so he won't have a police record.

07:31.474 --> 07:35.228
- He can come and go as he pleases.
- That sort of person costs money.

07:35.314 --> 07:36.667
Yes.

07:38.194 --> 07:40.150
I'll find the right man.

07:41.434 --> 07:44.073
<i>We'd better meet again</i>
<i>in three months, in Vienna.</i>

07:44.154 --> 07:48.306
<i>In the pension you both know;</i>
<i>Pension Kleist. June 15.</i>

07:49.554 --> 07:51.112
It's a limited market.

07:51.274 --> 07:53.230
I've compiled 11 dossiers
over three months.

07:53.314 --> 07:56.067
Only those four men
seemed anywhere near right.

07:56.994 --> 07:59.383
Now that you've read the files,
what do you think?

07:59.474 --> 08:02.272
<i>- One Englishman did all these jobs?</i>
<i>- I don't believe it.</i>

08:02.394 --> 08:05.272
<i>- It's true.</i>
<i>- He did that fellow in the Congo?</i>

08:05.354 --> 08:06.707
<i>And Trujillo?</i>

08:07.434 --> 08:09.186
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- That's our man then, isn't it?</i>

08:09.274 --> 08:11.424
I should say so.

08:11.714 --> 08:13.830
I'm glad you agree on the final choice.

08:14.514 --> 08:16.584
- Because he'll be here any moment.
- What?

08:16.874 --> 08:19.308
<i>He's arriving this afternoon from London.</i>

08:46.874 --> 08:48.273
Wolenski.

08:56.034 --> 08:58.707
A normal precaution, you understand.
Come in.

09:08.114 --> 09:11.424
We are not terrorists, you understand.
We are patriots.

09:11.994 --> 09:14.792
Our duty is to the soldiers
who died fighting in Algeria...

09:14.874 --> 09:17.627
...and the 3 million French citizens
who live there.

09:17.714 --> 09:19.830
You want to get rid of him?

09:21.634 --> 09:24.273
Speaking as a professional,
do you think it's possible?

09:25.634 --> 09:28.785
It's possible.
The point is getting away with it.

09:29.314 --> 09:31.828
As a professional,
it's an important consideration.

09:31.914 --> 09:34.269
In principle, you'd say it could be done?

09:36.154 --> 09:38.793
Yes. With enough time and planning.

09:39.914 --> 09:42.189
It would be more difficult
than most targets.

09:42.274 --> 09:43.150
Why more?

09:43.234 --> 09:46.385
Because De Gaulle has
the best security in the world.

09:46.714 --> 09:48.750
Their information is first-class.

09:49.234 --> 09:52.112
You see, gentlemen,
not only have your own efforts failed...

09:52.194 --> 09:54.310
...but you've queered the pitch for others.

09:54.394 --> 09:57.830
- How dare you suggest...
- You can't afford to be emotional.

09:58.034 --> 09:59.911
It's why you've made so many mistakes.

10:00.714 --> 10:04.548
- lf we decided to employ a professional...
- You have to employ a professional.

10:04.634 --> 10:07.068
Your organization is
so riddled with informers...

10:07.154 --> 10:10.146
...that nothing you decide
is a secret for long.

10:10.954 --> 10:13.104
The job would have to be done
by an outsider.

10:13.194 --> 10:16.186
The only question is
by whom and for how much?

10:17.914 --> 10:19.267
Will you do it?

10:21.034 --> 10:22.262
- Yes.
- How much?

10:22.354 --> 10:24.663
Understand, this is a once-in-a-lifetime job.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.745
- They can never work again.
- How much?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.426
- Half a million, in cash.
- What?

10:28.514 --> 10:30.425
Half in advance and half on completion.

10:30.514 --> 10:32.505
- Half a million francs?
- Dollars.

10:33.514 --> 10:34.390
Are you mad?

10:34.474 --> 10:37.830
Considering you'd get France in return,
I thought it a reasonable price.

10:38.194 --> 10:41.823
But if you can't manage it,
there's nothing more to be said.

10:43.394 --> 10:44.509
We accept.

10:47.274 --> 10:49.151
How many people know about this?

10:49.234 --> 10:51.429
- Just the four of us.
- Let's keep it that way.

10:51.874 --> 10:54.149
This job depends on absolute secrecy.

10:54.314 --> 10:55.872
No notes must be kept.

10:55.954 --> 10:58.752
If any of you is captured, I shall call it off.

10:58.834 --> 11:02.588
I suggest you stay in a safe place under
guard until the work is done. Agreed?

11:03.354 --> 11:04.343
Agreed.

11:05.234 --> 11:06.826
The planning will be mine.

11:07.074 --> 11:10.191
No one else will get the details
and you won't hear from me again.

11:10.274 --> 11:13.107
Here's the name and account number
of my bank in Switzerland.

11:13.194 --> 11:16.789
When they tell me the first $250,000
has been deposited, I'll move...

11:16.954 --> 11:18.182
...provided I'm ready.

11:18.514 --> 11:20.345
But I'll not be hurried in any way.

11:21.354 --> 11:22.389
Agreed.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.863
All I want from you is
a phone number in Paris...

11:24.954 --> 11:27.514
...that I can call
about changes in De Gaulle's plans.

11:27.594 --> 11:30.233
The contact mustn't know
who I am or what this is about.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.713
Send me the number by mail.

11:31.794 --> 11:34.388
How do you expect us
to find the money so soon?

11:34.474 --> 11:36.510
Use your network to rob some banks.

11:36.954 --> 11:38.433
One last thing.

11:41.194 --> 11:43.150
What code name will you use?

11:43.714 --> 11:45.113
Why not "The Jackal"?

11:46.074 --> 11:47.302
Why not?

11:48.754 --> 11:52.269
There's nothing more you want from us.
You'll be working completely alone.

11:52.354 --> 11:55.551
Not completely.
One will have the cooperation of De Gaulle.

11:56.794 --> 12:01.151
He won't listen to his security service
and stay out of the public eye.

12:02.114 --> 12:05.231
A pleasant journey home, Mr. Jackal.

12:42.274 --> 12:45.550
960,000 francs? This has got to stop!

12:45.634 --> 12:47.352
You're the Chief of Action Service.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.187
You've had 3 weeks to find out
if the OAS is involved...

12:50.274 --> 12:53.664
...and if they are, what are they up to?
- It is the OAS, General.

12:54.194 --> 12:56.230
But the ones we've caught are small fry.

12:56.434 --> 12:59.107
They've been ordered to do it,
but they don't know why.

12:59.194 --> 13:00.912
The Minister's been after me again.

13:00.994 --> 13:03.383
We've questioned all known OAS people.

13:03.514 --> 13:05.266
They know nothing.

13:05.354 --> 13:07.470
- What about the informers?
- Nothing.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.583
But we found out this morning
that Rodin and the other two are in Rome.

13:11.674 --> 13:13.505
They arrived on June 18.

13:13.594 --> 13:16.154
They've taken the two top floors
in Hotel Garibaldi.

13:16.234 --> 13:19.112
- You're watching them, of course?
- Twenty-four hours a day.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.871
'Morning. Birth certificate, please.
Paul Oliver Duggan.

14:48.954 --> 14:52.549
Born in the parish of Sambourne Fishley,
April 3, 1929.

14:52.674 --> 14:55.586
Fill in the form.
You'll find the 1929's up those stairs...

14:55.674 --> 14:58.268
...and left at the first gallery.
- Right. Thanks.

16:37.154 --> 16:38.507
Thank you, sir.

16:41.594 --> 16:44.904
Excuse me, please.
How many krone to the pound?

16:45.514 --> 16:48.426
The official parity rate is 19.34.

17:03.994 --> 17:06.508
Hello. Two bottles of hairpin, please.

17:06.594 --> 17:09.267
One in chestnut brown and one in gray.

17:11.513 --> 17:13.823
I've only got Clairol, dear.

17:14.473 --> 17:17.784
That's fine. And also a tin of solvent.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.268
- It is here.
- Is it?

17:44.314 --> 17:45.508
Hello?

17:45.634 --> 17:46.987
Yes.

17:47.474 --> 17:49.032
Hello, Zurich?

17:49.394 --> 17:51.385
Mr. Kola, this is he.

17:51.634 --> 17:54.353
That's right. Account Number 50664.

17:55.474 --> 17:57.226
The money's been deposited.

17:58.074 --> 17:59.109
How much?

18:17.074 --> 18:22.023
<i>Alitalia announces the departure</i>
<i>of Flight 127 to Genova.</i>

18:22.114 --> 18:24.469
<i>Now boarding at Gate 5.</i>

18:42.194 --> 18:46.153
The Hotel Garibaldi is owned
by a Frenchman with OAS sympathies.

18:46.234 --> 18:50.147
Extra Action Service staff have been sent
from Paris to Rome...

18:50.314 --> 18:52.669
...to keep watching them around-the-clock.

18:54.554 --> 18:58.627
Rodin, Montclair and Casson
live at the top floor alone.

18:59.114 --> 19:01.389
On the next floor down
are the bodyguards...

19:01.474 --> 19:04.113
...ex-paratroopers or foreign legionnaires.

19:04.274 --> 19:06.265
- How many?
- Eight.

19:06.594 --> 19:10.428
- They're afraid of being kidnapped.
- I know Rodin. He's not a man to be afraid.

19:10.514 --> 19:13.506
The lift doors on the top floor
are welded together...

19:13.594 --> 19:15.903
...and everything goes through
the bodyguards.

19:15.994 --> 19:19.384
Not one of them has set a foot
outside the hotel for five weeks.

19:19.474 --> 19:22.068
The only contact
with the outside world is one man:

19:22.154 --> 19:24.793
- Adjutant Wolenski.
- Tell me about him.

19:24.874 --> 19:26.751
Bersie, run the film, please.

19:31.794 --> 19:33.512
This is Wolenski.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.512
He goes to the post office
every morning and afternoon.

19:40.594 --> 19:41.913
See that?

19:42.394 --> 19:45.864
You'll have to cut his hand off
to get the mail away from him.

19:58.194 --> 20:02.392
He always waits until the collection van
arrives before he posts any letters.

20:02.474 --> 20:04.226
Then he goes to pick up the mail.

20:12.234 --> 20:16.022
All their mail comes to general delivery
and is addressed in the name of Partrier.

20:16.514 --> 20:19.312
Wolenski, of course,
can identify himself as such.

20:24.594 --> 20:25.913
Colonel Rolland here.

20:25.994 --> 20:29.669
I want everything you've got
in the archives on a foreign legionnaire.

20:29.754 --> 20:31.312
His name is Viktor Wolenski.

20:31.394 --> 20:35.546
If the OAS is planning something big,
their agents must be working on it now.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.512
<i>You must find out who they are</i>
<i>and where they make contact.</i>

21:01.114 --> 21:02.945
I let myself in.

21:05.154 --> 21:07.031
I'll make us some coffee.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.753
Denise.

21:14.514 --> 21:17.870
I ask you to get rid of these.
It's for your own safety.

21:18.914 --> 21:20.267
I'll do it tonight.

21:20.394 --> 21:22.464
Maybe I should do it for you now.

21:24.514 --> 21:27.108
They know all about your fiancé.

21:37.834 --> 21:40.792
I have an assignment for you
that sounds very important.

21:41.234 --> 21:42.872
It's not very pleasant.

21:45.074 --> 21:46.348
Go on.

21:52.074 --> 21:55.384
They want you to get involved
with an official of the Élysée Palace...

21:55.994 --> 21:58.030
...someone fairly close to De Gaulle.

21:58.954 --> 22:00.831
It might be dangerous.

22:01.434 --> 22:03.265
It's certainly distasteful.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.392
Who is this official?

22:09.594 --> 22:12.108
I'll show him to you in a week or so.

22:37.114 --> 22:38.786
Good afternoon.

22:39.034 --> 22:41.867
Yes, please come in.

22:44.674 --> 22:46.187
You think you can do it?

22:47.314 --> 22:48.429
Certainly.

22:48.514 --> 22:51.392
I can take an existing gun,
make the modifications.

22:51.474 --> 22:55.069
It must be very light in weight,
and it must have a short barrel.

22:55.154 --> 22:58.066
A short barrel. That's a pity.

22:58.634 --> 23:02.343
Lastly, there must be a silencer
and a telescopic sight.

23:05.474 --> 23:08.307
Over what range will you fire?

23:08.594 --> 23:11.984
I'm not sure yet,
but probably not more than 400 feet.

23:12.114 --> 23:14.912
- Will the gentleman be moving?
- Stationary.

23:15.234 --> 23:18.146
Will you go for a head shot
or a chest shot?

23:18.394 --> 23:19.873
Probably head.

23:20.034 --> 23:22.104
What about the chances of a second shot?

23:22.194 --> 23:24.264
I might get the chance, but I doubt it.

23:24.594 --> 23:26.903
In any event, I'll need a silencer to escape.

23:27.754 --> 23:30.348
In that case,
you better have explosive bullets.

23:31.074 --> 23:34.783
- I can prepare a handful for you.
- Glycerin or mercury?

23:35.874 --> 23:37.830
Mercury, I think.

23:39.634 --> 23:41.352
It's much cleaner.

23:42.034 --> 23:44.264
- More Campari?
- No, thank you.

23:44.834 --> 23:46.153
It seems then...

23:46.474 --> 23:49.989
...the gun must be carried past customs
without arousing suspicion.

23:53.274 --> 23:54.992
Recognize that?

23:59.034 --> 24:02.106
The whole thing should be made
of hollow aluminium tubes...

24:02.194 --> 24:04.662
...which screw together. The top one...

24:04.914 --> 24:08.907
...holds the rifle strut. The one below,
the bolt with the breech inside it.

24:09.514 --> 24:12.347
The shoulder rest of the rifle
doubles for both purposes...

24:12.434 --> 24:14.902
...without changing in any way.
- That's excellent.

24:14.994 --> 24:18.191
The last two sections house
the telescopic sight and silencer.

24:18.554 --> 24:19.907
Here.

24:21.834 --> 24:25.224
It's very remarkable. It's so simple.

24:25.354 --> 24:27.629
I shall need the gun in about two weeks.

24:28.994 --> 24:31.030
If you could meet me here...

24:31.994 --> 24:35.543
...August 13, you could try out
the gun and discuss last minute details.

24:35.634 --> 24:37.386
Very well. August 13.

24:37.474 --> 24:39.510
Now the question of your fee.

24:44.514 --> 24:48.553
I have to ask a fee of 1,000 pounds
for this kind of a job...

24:49.434 --> 24:51.868
...you see and, say...

24:51.994 --> 24:55.748
...another 100 or 200 pounds
for the raw materials.

24:56.554 --> 24:57.748
Done.

24:58.074 --> 25:02.431
I'll pay you half the fee now
and the rest on delivery.

25:32.914 --> 25:34.870
What do you think? Marvelous?

25:36.674 --> 25:39.586
I knew you didn't come to Genova
for a driver's license.

25:39.714 --> 25:41.909
Anyone in London could've done that.

25:43.274 --> 25:45.913
Problem is I won't have time
to play around with makeup.

25:45.994 --> 25:48.872
- I'm not much good at it anyway.
- Forget about makeup.

25:48.954 --> 25:52.583
The important thing is the skin.
It must look gray and tired.

25:52.754 --> 25:57.032
We used a trick in the army to fake illness
and get out of fatigue duty.

25:57.114 --> 26:00.265
- Can you get hold of some cordite?
- I suppose so.

26:00.754 --> 26:03.268
You swallow a couple
of small pieces of cordite.

26:03.354 --> 26:06.710
It'll make you feel sick
and turn the skin a gray color.

26:06.914 --> 26:08.142
After about an hour...

26:08.234 --> 26:11.510
...you'll feel all right again,
but your skin looks gray much longer.

26:11.594 --> 26:12.993
I'll try it.

26:13.074 --> 26:14.905
What about the French documents?

26:15.274 --> 26:17.469
French identity card's all right.

26:17.754 --> 26:20.712
The other one,
I don't think I've seen what they look like...

26:20.794 --> 26:22.113
...let alone copy it.

26:22.194 --> 26:25.664
I'll get a colleague in France to pick
a pocket so I can make a duplicate.

26:27.234 --> 26:30.385
Give me more time, more money.

26:31.234 --> 26:32.667
How much more?

26:33.034 --> 26:34.387
Five hundred.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.986
Three hundred pounds?

26:38.954 --> 26:42.549
- Half now, half on delivery.
- When will I hear from you?

26:42.834 --> 26:45.109
I'll be returning to Genova on August 14.

26:45.194 --> 26:47.947
Be in the same place
where we met tonight at 6:00.

26:49.114 --> 26:50.945
Must be a big job you've got.

26:51.074 --> 26:53.269
There are certain things
I wish to make clear.

26:53.354 --> 26:55.504
When you've finished,
I want the negatives...

26:55.594 --> 26:58.233
...and all the prints
of the photographs you've taken.

26:58.554 --> 27:00.545
You will also forget the name Duggan...

27:00.634 --> 27:03.626
...and the name on the French
documents you're going to produce.

27:03.714 --> 27:05.511
Is that understood?

29:28.954 --> 29:31.832
Taking it easy? I wish I had your job.

29:32.074 --> 29:35.305
All my tenants are on holiday.
What time is it?

29:35.754 --> 29:38.029
- Half past 5:00.
- I must hurry.

29:38.114 --> 29:39.945
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

31:33.754 --> 31:35.107
That's him. See?

31:35.194 --> 31:38.470
In the light coat.
He's the official at the Élysée Palace.

31:39.794 --> 31:43.912
He'll pack his wife and children off
to the Loire Valley for the holiday.

31:43.994 --> 31:46.064
You haven't got much time.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.707
I need Wolenski.

31:49.794 --> 31:52.262
Arrange to get him across the border.

31:52.594 --> 31:56.189
What? Never mind the Italian government.

31:56.594 --> 31:59.711
Once you have him inside France,
bring him to Paris immediately.

32:48.674 --> 32:51.188
You're being very foolish, Viktor.

32:53.634 --> 32:56.512
You know yourself,
they always talk in the end.

32:56.914 --> 33:00.873
You've seen it with your own two eyes
in Indochina.

33:04.154 --> 33:06.031
And in Algeria, of course.

33:09.514 --> 33:12.233
Tell us what they're waiting for
in that hotel!

33:21.514 --> 33:24.904
What are they planning?
Who have they been meeting with?

33:26.314 --> 33:29.192
Nobody? Not a soul?

33:32.034 --> 33:34.992
Then where were they
before they went to Rome?

33:38.354 --> 33:40.345
Tell us, Viktor.

33:48.554 --> 33:49.953
Go back a bit.

33:50.834 --> 33:52.825
Hold it. Stop.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.349
Question:

33:56.834 --> 33:59.792
Rome, Viktor. Why did they go to Rome?

34:00.394 --> 34:02.191
- No answer.
- Check.

34:02.314 --> 34:04.782
Question: why are they in Rome?

34:04.914 --> 34:07.667
- Answer: secret.
- Check.

34:07.994 --> 34:11.703
Question: where did they stay
in Vienna, Viktor?

34:12.154 --> 34:13.985
- No answer.
- Check.

34:14.274 --> 34:15.866
Was it the house?

34:16.674 --> 34:19.234
I am asking you, was it a house?

34:20.434 --> 34:21.628
Answer:

34:24.914 --> 34:26.472
Kleist.

34:30.674 --> 34:31.743
Go on.

34:33.954 --> 34:36.514
Question: who is Kleist?

34:37.514 --> 34:38.993
What does he do?

34:41.434 --> 34:45.313
What did they do to the bastard?
I can't understand a word.

34:45.393 --> 34:47.271
- Put it on the speakers.
- Where from?

34:47.353 --> 34:49.663
"Who is Kleist?" That bit.

34:52.714 --> 34:55.911
<i>Who is Kleist? What does he do?</i>

35:06.354 --> 35:08.549
Jack? Jackie?

35:09.714 --> 35:12.023
- That wouldn't be Jackie? Would it?
- Jackie?

35:12.114 --> 35:13.467
That's not possible.

35:13.794 --> 35:16.513
Go back, and this time turn up the sound.

35:40.074 --> 35:41.746
Heel, Rex!

35:42.714 --> 35:44.272
Rex, come here!

35:54.754 --> 35:56.631
Are you all right?

35:57.554 --> 35:58.623
I think so.

35:58.714 --> 36:01.387
- Do you want me to call for an ambulance?
- No.

36:02.514 --> 36:04.152
Are you sure?

36:04.874 --> 36:06.705
I'll survive.

36:07.914 --> 36:10.474
There. See?

36:11.954 --> 36:13.546
I'm sorry.

36:14.274 --> 36:15.468
It's not your fault.

36:19.674 --> 36:22.313
- Sorry to drag you away, Colonel.
- Nonsense.

36:22.394 --> 36:25.352
The tape is on your machine
in case you want to refer back...

36:25.434 --> 36:27.789
...and here is the transcript.
- Yes.

36:47.634 --> 36:49.113
Jackal.

36:49.474 --> 36:51.704
I thought Wolenski used it
as a swear word...

36:51.794 --> 36:53.512
...but it doesn't sound like him.

36:55.514 --> 36:56.867
Fair.

37:00.994 --> 37:03.827
Excuse me, Colonel. The foreigner...

37:04.154 --> 37:06.714
...could it be a fair foreigner? A blonde?

37:11.554 --> 37:13.192
Is Kleist the foreigner?

37:18.434 --> 37:20.504
Colonel, it's 4:30.

37:31.474 --> 37:35.023
The plot described above constitutes,
in my view...

37:35.554 --> 37:38.512
...the most dangerous single conception
that the terrorists...

37:38.994 --> 37:40.871
...could possibly have devised...

37:41.154 --> 37:44.464
...to endanger the life
of President De Gaulle.

37:44.834 --> 37:48.110
If the plot exists as described...

37:48.674 --> 37:52.303
...and if a foreign-born assassin,
whose code name may be "Jackal"...

37:52.474 --> 37:55.864
...has, in fact, been engaged
for this attempt on the life...

37:55.954 --> 37:58.866
- Sorry.
- On the life of the President...

38:00.274 --> 38:03.505
...it is my duty to inform you,
Minister, that in my opinion...

38:03.794 --> 38:06.149
...we face a national emergency.

38:06.714 --> 38:08.113
New paragraph.

38:08.674 --> 38:12.144
The above report is top secret
and intended for your eyes only.

38:12.714 --> 38:15.148
Written at 0800 hours...

38:15.474 --> 38:18.784
...August 14, 1963.

38:19.834 --> 38:22.064
<i>Address to the Minister of the Interior.</i>

38:22.874 --> 38:25.104
<i>Have the dispatch rider stand by...</i>

38:25.954 --> 38:28.104
<i>... and forget everything you've heard.</i>

39:27.874 --> 39:29.068
Well?

39:30.474 --> 39:32.112
If what Rolland says is true...

39:32.194 --> 39:35.425
...the whole network of our agents
inside the OAS is no good to us.

39:41.074 --> 39:43.065
The President must be told.

39:43.634 --> 39:45.511
I'll ask for an interview.

39:46.114 --> 39:48.105
Get me the Élysée Palace.

40:11.114 --> 40:13.582
Minister. One moment, sir.

40:18.354 --> 40:19.912
The Minister of the Interior.

40:32.314 --> 40:33.633
There you are.

40:39.234 --> 40:41.065
It's all there.

40:43.394 --> 40:47.546
The Duggan driving license
and French identity card were easy but...

40:48.194 --> 40:50.628
...that third card was a big headache.

40:50.754 --> 40:52.870
It's nicely dog-eared, isn't it?

40:54.474 --> 40:56.988
- Have you forgotten something?
- Sorry?

40:58.394 --> 41:01.511
The original driving license.
The one I said I wanted back.

41:03.234 --> 41:05.384
I thought we might have a chat about that.

41:10.314 --> 41:13.272
The fact is,
the original driving license is not here.

41:13.434 --> 41:16.426
But don't worry.
It's put away in a very safe place.

41:16.554 --> 41:19.022
Nobody can get at it but me.

41:21.234 --> 41:23.702
- What do you want?
- I'm coming to that.

41:23.874 --> 41:26.342
What I propose is simply a little trade.

41:26.434 --> 41:28.709
I give you the original driving license...

41:28.794 --> 41:31.354
...and all those negatives I took of you...

41:31.554 --> 41:33.226
...for a certain sum of money.

41:33.314 --> 41:35.669
- How much?
- A thousand pounds.

41:35.834 --> 41:39.713
Isn't it worth that
to get those documents back?

41:41.274 --> 41:43.026
Yes, I suppose so.

41:43.394 --> 41:46.466
An English gentleman can always
be trusted to see sense.

41:46.634 --> 41:50.263
I can find the first 500 by noon tomorrow,
but we don't meet here.

41:50.354 --> 41:52.231
There's nothing wrong with this place.

41:52.314 --> 41:53.986
It's very quiet and private.

41:54.074 --> 41:56.383
There's everything wrong with this place.

41:56.474 --> 42:00.672
Forget about that. Nobody comes here
unless they're invited by me.

42:00.754 --> 42:04.872
One has to be very discreet,
you know, in my little sideline.

43:41.354 --> 43:42.867
I asked for aluminium.

43:43.554 --> 43:46.705
I tried the aluminium but it just did bend...

43:46.914 --> 43:49.428
...like tissue paper.
I had to use stainless steel.

43:50.114 --> 43:52.674
But it's all right. It looks the same.

43:52.754 --> 43:54.107
Where can I practice?

43:54.954 --> 43:58.390
There's the Montemorro Forest.
You could be there and back in a day.

43:58.634 --> 44:00.465
- Excuse me.
- I won't need the case.

44:01.714 --> 44:03.545
Silencer, please.

44:06.794 --> 44:08.147
Strut.

44:11.594 --> 44:13.505
And the sniper scope.

44:14.234 --> 44:15.462
Here.

44:20.634 --> 44:21.953
Trigger.

44:22.474 --> 44:23.987
Trigger, please.

44:41.674 --> 44:44.142
- Beautiful piece of work.
- I know.

44:44.554 --> 44:46.624
- It's really excellent.
- Yes.

44:48.274 --> 44:52.062
These are for practice.
I took out six of them...

44:52.434 --> 44:54.584
...to convert to explosive tips.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.832
Let me have one.

45:13.594 --> 45:16.313
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

45:16.754 --> 45:18.267
Please sit down.

45:19.874 --> 45:22.513
I trust that you've all read
Colonel Rolland's report?

45:24.314 --> 45:27.226
I delivered a copy
to the President this afternoon.

45:28.034 --> 45:31.185
Unhappily, in the interest
of the dignity of France...

45:31.274 --> 45:34.471
...he feels obliged to impose
enormous limitations on us.

45:34.794 --> 45:37.262
He refuses to alter in any way...

45:37.434 --> 45:40.028
...the summer schedule
of his public appearances.

45:40.114 --> 45:41.388
Good heavens.

45:41.594 --> 45:44.870
The search for this Jackal
will be conducted in absolute secrecy.

45:45.634 --> 45:48.626
Needless to say,
you are all sworn to total silence...

45:48.714 --> 45:51.274
...and won't discuss this matter
outside this room.

45:51.354 --> 45:52.753
But Minister...

45:54.314 --> 45:55.747
But it's impossible!

45:55.834 --> 45:58.473
The President was absolutely adamant.

45:59.074 --> 46:02.464
What extra security precautions
do we take, Minister?

46:02.634 --> 46:03.908
None.

46:04.954 --> 46:07.627
General Colbert. Any success in Vienna?

46:07.714 --> 46:11.946
Inquiries were made by our agents
at the Pension Kleist.

46:12.114 --> 46:16.187
They showed photographs of Rodin,
Montclair and Casson to the desk clerk.

46:16.634 --> 46:20.468
Some money changed hands.
He stated that he recognized them.

46:20.554 --> 46:22.829
They had arrived on June 14.

46:24.074 --> 46:25.507
Were there any visitors?

46:26.034 --> 46:28.025
One man the next afternoon.

46:28.274 --> 46:30.583
He left half an hour later.

46:31.034 --> 46:35.391
The only description the clerk could give
was the man was well-groomed...

46:35.474 --> 46:37.704
...in his early thirties and had fair hair.

46:39.154 --> 46:41.509
Surely a better description can be found.

46:41.594 --> 46:42.947
From whom?

46:45.994 --> 46:47.473
Rodin, for instance.

46:48.754 --> 46:52.827
I hardly think he'd accept an invitation
from any of our departments, Colonel.

46:58.154 --> 47:01.146
Commissioner Berthier, any suggestions?

47:02.114 --> 47:03.945
We're in trouble on this one.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.429
Our agents inside the OAS
can't pin him down...

47:06.514 --> 47:08.948
...since not even the OAS know who he is.

47:09.034 --> 47:12.071
Action Service can't destroy him.
They don't know who to destroy.

47:12.154 --> 47:16.272
Surveillance can't get him at the border,
they don't know what he looks like.

47:16.354 --> 47:19.187
The gendarmes, all 48,000 of them,
can't pursue him.

47:19.274 --> 47:20.992
They don't know who to pursue.

47:21.074 --> 47:24.544
The police can't arrest him.
We don't know who to arrest.

47:25.794 --> 47:28.752
Without a name,
all other proposals are meaningless.

47:28.874 --> 47:30.785
The first task, then, is to find it.

47:30.994 --> 47:33.986
With a name, we get a passport and a face.

47:34.114 --> 47:36.503
With a face, we get an arrest.

47:37.394 --> 47:40.784
But to find his name,
and to do it in secret...

47:40.874 --> 47:43.024
...is a job of pure detective work.

47:43.114 --> 47:46.709
Commissioner,
who is the best detective on the force?

47:49.394 --> 47:50.713
The best detective...

47:50.914 --> 47:54.031
<i>... is my own deputy commissioner,</i>
<i>Claude Lebel.</i>

47:59.114 --> 48:00.467
Claude!

48:04.474 --> 48:06.544
Berthier wants to see you.

48:07.114 --> 48:09.423
- What? Now?
- He's sent a car.

48:11.994 --> 48:14.462
Don't be back later than 9:00.

48:29.034 --> 48:30.672
Commissioner Lebel.

48:35.034 --> 48:36.786
Good evening.

48:38.754 --> 48:41.746
Remember, you have full powers
in this investigation...

48:41.874 --> 48:45.913
...and the resources of every department
represented here entirely at your disposal.

48:45.994 --> 48:49.543
My instructions are simply:
no publicity and do not fail.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.471
Keep your copy of the report.

48:53.354 --> 48:54.628
Any questions?

48:55.314 --> 48:56.508
No, Minister.

48:56.874 --> 48:58.944
In that case, I'll not detain you.

49:01.154 --> 49:02.746
Thank you, Commissioner.

49:09.154 --> 49:11.714
Collect the reports
and put them in my private safe.

49:11.794 --> 49:13.193
- Yes, Minister.
- Good night.

49:13.274 --> 49:15.310
- Good night.
- Thank you.

49:29.354 --> 49:31.822
You'll have to drop whatever you're doing.

49:31.954 --> 49:33.467
Clear the desk completely.

49:33.554 --> 49:35.590
- You want a new office?
- No.

49:36.074 --> 49:39.225
From now on, it's headquarters for this job,
nothing else.

49:39.554 --> 49:42.352
The Minister said
he wants a progress report by you...

49:42.434 --> 49:44.311
...every evening from now on.

49:44.674 --> 49:47.268
- Here. 10:00 sharp.
- Oh, God.

49:47.434 --> 49:48.628
I know.

49:48.874 --> 49:52.264
You've just got to find him
before he gets to De Gaulle.

49:52.394 --> 49:55.466
- I wonder if he has a timetable.
- I'm sure he has.

49:55.554 --> 49:57.272
The trouble is, only he knows it.

49:57.354 --> 50:00.471
He might go for a hit tomorrow
or maybe not for a month.

50:00.714 --> 50:03.182
You've got to work flat out
until you locate him.

50:03.274 --> 50:06.710
After that, we can have Action Service
do the rest, the thugs.

50:06.994 --> 50:10.464
Obviously, you've got to have
a heavy mug for a thing like this.

50:11.274 --> 50:14.869
Anyway, just go and find this Jackal,
will you?

50:16.914 --> 50:17.790
What?

50:19.394 --> 50:21.464
- I'll need help.
- Who?

50:21.674 --> 50:23.949
Young Caron, and he'll have to be told.

50:24.314 --> 50:28.546
- I'll have to get clearance.
- All I want is Caron. That's all.

50:34.554 --> 50:38.069
You know, sir, what they'll do to you
if you don't catch him in time.

50:38.794 --> 50:41.433
I've been given a job,
so we'll just have to do it.

50:41.514 --> 50:43.345
But no crime has been committed yet.

50:43.434 --> 50:46.187
Where are we supposed to start looking
for the criminal?

50:46.394 --> 50:48.749
We start by recognizing that,
after De Gaulle...

50:48.834 --> 50:51.189
...we are the two most
powerful people in France.

50:51.274 --> 50:52.787
Now make notes.

50:53.794 --> 50:56.467
Get my secretary transferred
until further notice.

50:56.554 --> 50:59.705
You will be my secretary
and assistant rolled into one.

51:00.034 --> 51:03.265
I want a camp bed in here
with linen and all the usual...

51:03.394 --> 51:06.352
...including something to wash in
and shaving things.

51:06.674 --> 51:08.824
Also, get a percolator and lots of coffee.

51:08.914 --> 51:11.269
- Right, sir.
- Get onto the switchboard.

51:11.834 --> 51:14.553
I want a good telephonist,
the best they've got.

51:14.634 --> 51:17.592
I need ten outside lines
open around-the-clock.

51:17.834 --> 51:20.143
If there's any nonsense,
refer them to Berthier.

51:20.234 --> 51:22.304
This job gets top priority at all times.

51:22.394 --> 51:24.430
Do you want anything
from them immediately?

51:24.514 --> 51:26.391
A person-to-person link to the heads...

51:26.474 --> 51:29.147
...of the homicide divisions
of the following countries:

51:29.234 --> 51:32.510
Holland, Belgium, Italy, West Germany...

51:33.074 --> 51:34.632
...and South Africa.

51:34.714 --> 51:36.386
The FBI in the United States...

51:36.474 --> 51:38.863
...and Scotland Yard's
Special Branch in Britain.

51:38.954 --> 51:41.343
- How many is that?
- Seven.

51:41.514 --> 51:43.869
Get the head man at home or in the office.

51:43.954 --> 51:46.422
Ask them to take a call from me
tomorrow morning...

51:46.514 --> 51:48.664
...and see that there's no one listening in.

51:48.754 --> 51:51.314
In the meantime,
I'm going down to General Records...

51:51.394 --> 51:54.352
...to check if this Jackal
has ever operated inside France.

51:54.554 --> 51:58.467
Sir, how do you know the Jackal
comes from any of these countries?

51:58.874 --> 51:59.909
I don't.

52:00.514 --> 52:02.982
But he must be on file somewhere.

52:21.554 --> 52:25.388
- Sorry I'm late, darling.
- What kept you so long?

52:25.514 --> 52:29.189
- There was a long meeting.
- I've been waiting for hours.

52:29.474 --> 52:32.705
Yes, I'm sorry about the hour, <i>but...</i>

52:33.554 --> 52:36.944
Yes, Washington, I know it's 7:00 there.
It's midnight here.

52:38.354 --> 52:39.309
What?

52:40.834 --> 52:43.473
Could you call him at the club, please?

52:44.794 --> 52:46.113
I didn't go out.

52:46.354 --> 52:48.504
I just sat waiting for you to call.

52:48.594 --> 52:50.744
It was impossible. There was a crisis on.

52:50.834 --> 52:53.223
Crisis? What crisis?

52:53.834 --> 52:55.187
Never mind.

53:01.074 --> 53:03.429
- What crisis?
- It was nothing.

53:05.354 --> 53:06.867
What crisis?

53:11.754 --> 53:12.982
Mr. Mallinson.

53:13.394 --> 53:17.433
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
It's Paris calling, Inspector Caron.

53:17.514 --> 53:20.153
I don't wish to sound rude,
but wouldn't it be better...

53:20.234 --> 53:23.863
...if routine inquiries could be conducted
through proper channels?

53:24.114 --> 53:25.752
Preferably when we're all awake?

53:26.674 --> 53:30.144
I'm sorry, Mr. Mallinson. It is very urgent.

53:30.314 --> 53:32.953
Commissioner Lebel didn't wish
to make a formal request.

53:33.034 --> 53:35.753
He was hoping
that you'd cooperate with us unofficially.

53:36.194 --> 53:39.869
All right.
I'll take the Commissioner's call at 8:30.

53:40.354 --> 53:42.231
Fine. Good night.

53:43.834 --> 53:45.187
What's left of it.

53:45.394 --> 53:48.192
- Who was that?
- The old boy network.

54:39.474 --> 54:40.543
Yes?

54:40.914 --> 54:43.109
<i>- Denise.</i>
- Valmy here.

54:43.554 --> 54:45.545
<i>They found out about the Jackal.</i>

54:49.434 --> 54:53.586
All I found in Central Records was that
in the 10 last years there've only been...

54:53.674 --> 54:55.710
...four contract killers in France.

54:55.794 --> 54:59.548
We've got three. The fourth is
serving time in Africa somewhere.

54:59.674 --> 55:01.983
So, our man must be from abroad.

55:02.234 --> 55:05.226
Surely he's come to someone's attention
somewhere.

55:07.274 --> 55:09.834
- Who do I speak to first?
- Scotland Yard...

55:10.674 --> 55:12.073
<i>... Special Branch.</i>

55:12.594 --> 55:14.664
<i>Assistant Commissioner Mallinson.</i>

55:16.234 --> 55:19.544
There's no name.
Nothing to go on, I'm afraid.

55:22.554 --> 55:25.944
It's pretty irregular,
all this unofficial secrecy, isn't it?

55:26.074 --> 55:27.712
Makes my task difficult.

55:28.114 --> 55:29.388
Yes, I know.

55:30.594 --> 55:33.666
I've never heard of a political killer
in this country.

55:33.874 --> 55:37.469
- It's not our style, is it?
- No, it's more your department...

55:38.074 --> 55:40.144
...so, I'll leave it in your hands.
- Yes...

55:40.234 --> 55:42.794
And try to get it out of the way
by tomorrow.

55:43.034 --> 55:44.786
I'm understaffed as it is.

55:45.354 --> 55:46.992
Yes, sir.

55:51.194 --> 55:52.752
What's the cost?

59:02.154 --> 59:04.668
Give me the Foreign Office,
would you, please, luv?

59:04.754 --> 59:06.472
Extension 905.

59:11.994 --> 59:13.222
Hello, Barrie?

59:13.954 --> 59:15.148
Brian Thomas.

59:15.354 --> 59:18.426
Could you meet me in an hour
at the usual place?

59:25.314 --> 59:28.147
We've been plowing through the files
till we're cross-eyed.

59:28.234 --> 59:30.111
None of them fits the description.

59:30.194 --> 59:32.264
But before we drop it, I had a thought.

59:32.554 --> 59:34.909
If this contract killer
did all his work abroad...

59:34.994 --> 59:37.269
...he'd be quite respectable
in England, right?

59:37.354 --> 59:38.104
So?

59:38.394 --> 59:42.546
Your people operate abroad. I thought
you might have tabs on a bloke like that.

59:42.634 --> 59:44.465
I'll have a look.

59:46.474 --> 59:48.271
Brian, call for you.

59:55.154 --> 59:56.109
Thomas.

59:56.634 --> 59:58.033
Yes, that's right.

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.584
Is this some sort of bloody joke?

01:00:04.794 --> 01:00:06.307
What, now?

01:00:07.554 --> 01:00:08.623
Personally?

01:00:09.714 --> 01:00:11.306
Yes, I'll...

01:00:34.434 --> 01:00:36.994
- The Prime Minister?
- The Prime Minister, sir.

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:41.227
He said, "If there's the remotest chance
of De Gaulle's life being threatened...

01:00:41.314 --> 01:00:44.465
"...by a person of these islands,
then it is to be stopped."

01:00:44.554 --> 01:00:47.273
He's given me full powers and top priority.

01:00:47.794 --> 01:00:50.103
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Of course not, sir.

01:00:50.194 --> 01:00:52.310
I've got to drop whatever I'm doing.

01:00:52.394 --> 01:00:55.227
I shall need six of your best men
straightaway.

01:00:56.834 --> 01:01:00.304
Where's the notification for this?
Where's the proper authority?

01:01:01.794 --> 01:01:02.988
Yes!

01:01:07.674 --> 01:01:09.710
Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

01:01:16.354 --> 01:01:19.824
Nothing more than taproom gossip,
I'm afraid.

01:01:20.354 --> 01:01:22.106
Do you remember Trujillo?

01:01:23.034 --> 01:01:26.106
You mean the dictator
of some republic in South America?

01:01:26.234 --> 01:01:28.873
Yes, Dominica. He was killed in 1961.

01:01:29.274 --> 01:01:32.983
We got word that an Englishman
may have been mixed up in it.

01:01:33.354 --> 01:01:35.584
Just an unconfirmed report, mind you.

01:01:35.874 --> 01:01:39.150
- Did he have a name?
- Charles Harold Calthrop.

01:01:39.594 --> 01:01:43.143
He was the Caribbean rep
for a small armaments firm.

01:01:43.674 --> 01:01:46.871
According to the rumor,
he was a fantastic shot.

01:01:47.834 --> 01:01:50.189
He disappeared after the assassination.

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:52.392
Nobody knows where he went.

01:01:53.314 --> 01:01:54.349
Calthrop.

01:01:54.474 --> 01:01:56.942
- Is that all there is to go on?
- Afraid so.

01:01:57.514 --> 01:01:58.788
Just a name?

01:02:01.594 --> 01:02:03.550
What makes you think it might be him?

01:02:03.634 --> 01:02:06.831
Your friend's code name is "Jackal", right?

01:02:07.234 --> 01:02:08.792
Jackal in French is...

01:02:09.234 --> 01:02:11.873
<i>..."chacal."</i>

01:02:12.514 --> 01:02:13.344
See?

01:02:13.514 --> 01:02:15.584
Now it might just be a coincidence...

01:02:15.674 --> 01:02:18.825
...but the first three letters
of his Christian name, Charles...

01:02:18.914 --> 01:02:22.429
...and the first three letters
of Calthrop make <i>up...</i>

01:02:36.954 --> 01:02:40.105
That's all the Charles H. Calthrop,
way back to 1958.

01:02:40.274 --> 01:02:42.105
- How many does that make?
- 23.

01:02:46.194 --> 01:02:48.310
Will you please tell Commissioner Lebel...

01:02:48.394 --> 01:02:51.272
...that there is a faint possibility,
very faint...

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:54.910
...the name is Charles Harold Calthrop.

01:02:55.834 --> 01:02:58.428
That's right.
We've checked with the Passport Office.

01:02:58.514 --> 01:03:01.312
23 passports were issued
to Charles H. Calthrop...

01:03:01.514 --> 01:03:03.425
...during the past five years.

01:03:03.674 --> 01:03:05.904
We've interviewed 12 of them so far.

01:03:06.834 --> 01:03:09.473
Nothing at all, but I'll keep you posted.

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:11.865
Do you have a garage for rent?

01:05:00.714 --> 01:05:02.113
Excuse me.

01:05:02.354 --> 01:05:04.948
Would you happen to know
where Mr. Charles Calthrop is?

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.353
- Mr. Calthrop?
- Yes.

01:05:06.794 --> 01:05:09.547
I think he's abroad. He often is, you know.

01:05:10.394 --> 01:05:11.429
Thank you.

01:05:11.994 --> 01:05:13.950
We better get a search warrant.

01:05:29.874 --> 01:05:31.387
What's happening?

01:05:39.754 --> 01:05:40.869
Come in.

01:05:43.274 --> 01:05:46.266
We've been through the lot, sir.
He's away, all right.

01:05:47.874 --> 01:05:49.592
Let's see what you've got.

01:06:08.154 --> 01:06:10.145
- What's this?
- His passport.

01:06:10.994 --> 01:06:12.666
We checked it. It's him.

01:06:12.874 --> 01:06:15.513
Look. The Dominican visa.

01:06:16.234 --> 01:06:19.624
There's no exit stamp though.
He must have got out on the sly.

01:06:20.554 --> 01:06:22.943
You haven't grasped it yet, have you?

01:06:23.234 --> 01:06:25.828
Yes, this is our man, all right. Definitely.

01:06:25.914 --> 01:06:29.304
But hasn't it occurred to you
that we're holding his passport?

01:06:29.954 --> 01:06:33.151
If he is out of the country,
what's he traveling on?

01:06:34.794 --> 01:06:37.592
- He might be on holiday in the UK.
- Yes, he might.

01:06:37.714 --> 01:06:39.386
Then again, he might not.

01:06:39.794 --> 01:06:43.389
His name is Charles Harold Calthrop.
Here's his passport photo.

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:48.871
I'll circulate photos
to each of you after the meeting.

01:06:49.434 --> 01:06:50.503
Excellent.

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.112
Thank you, Commissioner.

01:06:55.154 --> 01:07:00.103
It may be Calthrop has already entered
the country and is staying at a hotel.

01:07:00.194 --> 01:07:01.422
- Phillison.
- Minister?

01:07:01.514 --> 01:07:04.950
I want every hotel card for the past
72 hours checked by the police.

01:07:05.034 --> 01:07:09.152
The same for you, Pascal, with those cards
that are filed for the greater Paris area.

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:12.306
Circulate to your staffs
this man's name and photograph.

01:07:12.394 --> 01:07:16.182
He must be arrested on sight,
and my office notified at once.

01:07:16.794 --> 01:07:18.352
I want every border post...

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:21.267
...airport, seaport, fishing village alerted.

01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:24.110
- General Colbert.
- Minister?

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:27.864
Calthrop is probably still abroad,
so get your agents working on that.

01:07:27.954 --> 01:07:28.750
Yes, sir.

01:07:28.994 --> 01:07:31.588
In the meantime,
complete silence must be maintained...

01:07:31.674 --> 01:07:34.234
...until we're sure
the man's in this country.

01:07:34.314 --> 01:07:37.192
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

01:07:45.434 --> 01:07:47.265
Commissioner Lebel's office.

01:07:49.314 --> 01:07:50.508
Yes.

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:56.991
Thank you. Good-bye.

01:07:59.794 --> 01:08:03.184
No one called Calthrop has crossed
any border point legally...

01:08:03.274 --> 01:08:05.105
...since the start of the year.

01:08:05.194 --> 01:08:07.867
And no hotel has taken in a guest
under that name.

01:08:07.954 --> 01:08:10.343
Maybe he's given up and gone into hiding.

01:08:11.874 --> 01:08:14.468
If the British found
Calthrop's passport in his flat...

01:08:14.554 --> 01:08:16.863
...it's because he no longer needed it.

01:08:17.714 --> 01:08:20.069
Don't count on that man
making too many errors.

01:08:20.154 --> 01:08:21.667
He's not the type.

01:08:24.354 --> 01:08:26.948
I'm beginning to get
a feeling about the Jackal.

01:08:28.514 --> 01:08:31.312
He may be abroad,
traveling on a false passport.

01:08:32.234 --> 01:08:35.624
What you're going to do now is
go down to the Passport Office.

01:08:35.953 --> 01:08:39.469
Get every passport application
for the last three months.

01:08:39.554 --> 01:08:41.703
- But, sir...
- I don't care who's closed.

01:08:41.794 --> 01:08:43.273
Wake the buggers up.

01:08:43.874 --> 01:08:46.752
Then take all those papers
down to Somerset House...

01:08:46.953 --> 01:08:49.421
...get started on checking
the applicants' names...

01:08:49.514 --> 01:08:52.506
...against death certificates,
not birth certificates.

01:08:52.874 --> 01:08:56.469
If you find an application filed by someone
who died as a child...

01:08:56.554 --> 01:08:58.988
...the one who filed it might be our man.

01:08:59.913 --> 01:09:02.826
If you find nothing
in the first three months, go back three.

01:09:02.913 --> 01:09:04.711
And another three if you have to.

01:09:04.794 --> 01:09:06.147
Off you go.

01:09:42.913 --> 01:09:43.868
Yes?

01:09:44.354 --> 01:09:45.946
How's it going, Hughes?

01:09:47.913 --> 01:09:49.471
How many applications?

01:09:50.234 --> 01:09:52.189
8,041?

01:09:52.913 --> 01:09:54.552
You'll be there a week.

01:09:54.914 --> 01:09:57.144
How about I send you some more staff?

01:09:59.394 --> 01:10:01.112
Bloody holiday season.

01:10:09.034 --> 01:10:11.628
About 4,000 more to go, Mr. Thomas.

01:10:12.674 --> 01:10:15.984
But if we work through lunch,
we should be finished tonight.

01:10:55.754 --> 01:10:57.984
Superintendent Thomas, Special Branch.

01:10:59.754 --> 01:11:01.107
Hughes here, sir.

01:11:02.114 --> 01:11:03.752
Paul Oliver Duggan.

01:11:03.834 --> 01:11:07.190
Born April 3, 1929, in Sambourne Fishley.

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:09.584
Applied for passport July 14 of this year.

01:11:09.674 --> 01:11:12.905
Passport mailed July 17
to an address in Paddington.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:16.625
That will probably turn out
to be an accommodation address.

01:11:16.994 --> 01:11:17.949
Why?

01:11:18.154 --> 01:11:23.308
Because Duggan died at the age
of two and a half on November 8, 1931.

01:11:56.994 --> 01:11:58.507
Passport, please.

01:12:01.474 --> 01:12:02.623
One moment.

01:12:12.514 --> 01:12:14.664
- Mr. Duggan?
- Yes?

01:12:16.554 --> 01:12:19.022
What's the purpose of your visit to France?

01:12:19.474 --> 01:12:20.463
Tourism.

01:12:34.394 --> 01:12:36.669
- You buy this in Italy?
- No, it's hired.

01:12:36.994 --> 01:12:39.792
I shall be returning it to Genova
in about a week.

01:12:39.954 --> 01:12:41.182
Papers, please.

01:12:44.754 --> 01:12:46.187
Got any luggage?

01:12:47.594 --> 01:12:49.903
- In the boot.
- Bring it inside.

01:13:27.634 --> 01:13:28.749
Thank you.

01:13:55.194 --> 01:13:59.028
Once we've found his new name,
Lebel shouldn't have trouble catching him.

01:13:59.114 --> 01:14:00.547
It's not that simple.

01:14:00.634 --> 01:14:04.024
There are over two million foreigners
are in Paris at this time of year.

01:14:04.114 --> 01:14:05.991
I'm very sorry, Minister.

01:14:08.634 --> 01:14:10.864
Commissioner Lebel
requested this meeting...

01:14:10.954 --> 01:14:14.105
...because he has new information
on the British suspect.

01:14:15.634 --> 01:14:17.943
Calthrop is traveling on a false passport...

01:14:18.034 --> 01:14:20.309
...in the name of Paul Oliver Duggan.

01:14:21.594 --> 01:14:24.631
The passport number is 29491.

01:14:26.034 --> 01:14:28.343
The photo will reach us in a few hours.

01:14:28.634 --> 01:14:30.147
What do we do now?

01:14:30.794 --> 01:14:33.308
The Duggan passport
was issued on July 30.

01:14:33.394 --> 01:14:35.544
No need to go further back than that.

01:14:35.634 --> 01:14:38.102
Special Branch in Britain
is trying to trace him...

01:14:38.194 --> 01:14:41.027
...through the passenger lists
of all airlines and ferries.

01:14:41.314 --> 01:14:43.703
If they pick him up in Britain,
they'll detain him.

01:14:43.794 --> 01:14:46.308
If we locate him inside France,
we arrest him.

01:14:46.474 --> 01:14:50.149
If he's found in a third country,
Action Service will deal with him.

01:14:52.034 --> 01:14:56.744
In the meantime,
I'll be grateful if you would do this my way.

01:15:13.274 --> 01:15:16.949
- Good morning, sir.
- Paris, please. MOLITOR 5901.

01:15:17.194 --> 01:15:19.025
Carrier Number One, please.

01:15:33.794 --> 01:15:36.866
The Jackal is blown.
Wolenski talked before dying.

01:15:37.114 --> 01:15:38.945
Repeat: the Jackal is blown.

01:16:58.594 --> 01:17:00.789
Room 14. Thank you, Mr. Duggan.

01:17:41.154 --> 01:17:43.110
I'll have coffee in the lounge.

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.908
Do you mind my sitting here?

01:18:05.274 --> 01:18:06.309
Thank you.

01:18:16.714 --> 01:18:18.147
Boring, aren't they?

01:18:19.354 --> 01:18:20.673
The magazines.

01:18:22.034 --> 01:18:24.468
- I find them fascinating.
- What?

01:18:25.274 --> 01:18:28.471
Articles on pig breeding
and combine harvesters?

01:18:28.834 --> 01:18:31.302
I'm enthralled by combine harvesters.

01:18:31.994 --> 01:18:34.667
In fact, I yearn to have one as a pet.

01:18:46.234 --> 01:18:47.189
Yes?

01:18:48.794 --> 01:18:51.308
When did you say? This afternoon.

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:53.593
Repeat that again.

01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:57.988
A white Alfa Romeo sports two-seater...

01:18:58.314 --> 01:19:02.705
...license number GE 1741.

01:19:04.194 --> 01:19:07.903
Duggan crossed the border
at Ventimiglia four hours ago.

01:19:08.074 --> 01:19:10.668
Call London. Tell them
we'll handle it from now on.

01:19:10.754 --> 01:19:12.870
- Where is he?
- How should I know?

01:19:13.794 --> 01:19:16.354
Damned secrecy.
We have to wait for the hotel cards.

01:19:16.434 --> 01:19:20.063
It's madness.
There's nothing we can do about it.

01:19:22.194 --> 01:19:24.549
No, of course I don't live in the Alps.

01:19:24.634 --> 01:19:27.194
I went there for a visit, that's all.

01:19:27.354 --> 01:19:29.151
Climbing?

01:19:29.234 --> 01:19:31.702
Good lord, no.

01:19:32.074 --> 01:19:35.828
I spent the day at the Cadet Academy
in Barcelonnette...

01:19:35.914 --> 01:19:39.384
...amongst a lot
of jaundiced military types...

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:42.034
...watching my son receive his commission.

01:19:44.394 --> 01:19:46.225
He's nineteen.

01:19:48.474 --> 01:19:51.227
I never know when you're being serious.

01:19:51.914 --> 01:19:55.589
- It's true, unfortunately.
- Why "unfortunately"?

01:19:58.434 --> 01:19:59.947
I see nothing unfortunate...

01:20:00.034 --> 01:20:03.231
I'm not begging for compliments,
Mr. Duggan.

01:20:07.234 --> 01:20:10.032
- Will you have a liqueur?
- No, I must go to bed.

01:20:11.354 --> 01:20:13.709
I have to leave very early
tomorrow morning.

01:20:13.794 --> 01:20:16.262
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:20.505
Good night, Mr. Duggan.

01:22:31.994 --> 01:22:34.792
I've got to leave in a couple of hours.

01:22:34.994 --> 01:22:37.144
I've a long way to go.

01:22:37.234 --> 01:22:39.794
You've got to go back to your room.

01:22:40.154 --> 01:22:42.065
Your husband meeting you?

01:22:44.474 --> 01:22:46.465
No, he isn't there.

01:23:15.834 --> 01:23:17.187
Good morning.

01:23:17.474 --> 01:23:19.749
Excuse me, madam.

01:23:21.234 --> 01:23:23.384
Only three new guests last night.

01:23:27.954 --> 01:23:30.468
All right. Put them in the rack for Nice.

01:23:35.954 --> 01:23:37.785
Cards ready yet?

01:23:55.194 --> 01:23:56.991
Hello? Nice?

01:23:59.114 --> 01:24:00.752
Repeat, please.

01:24:04.154 --> 01:24:06.907
Stay by the phone until I call back.
Don't do a thing.

01:24:06.994 --> 01:24:09.747
I don't want him disturbed yet,
but isolate the place.

01:24:09.834 --> 01:24:12.473
Let no one in or out
and stop all phone calls.

01:24:14.394 --> 01:24:17.113
He's been staying in this hotel near Grasse.

01:24:17.354 --> 01:24:19.993
- He's registered for two days.
- Shall I put out an alert?

01:24:20.074 --> 01:24:22.588
No. He'll kill anybody
who tries to intercept him.

01:24:22.674 --> 01:24:24.187
We'd better get there right away.

01:25:15.234 --> 01:25:17.589
You have an Englishman
named Duggan staying here.

01:25:17.674 --> 01:25:19.630
- Where is he?
- Mr. Duggan's gone, sir.

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:22.633
He left this morning, just after 11:00.

01:25:25.274 --> 01:25:28.789
Assemble the staff and guests.
Don't let anyone get away.

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:30.432
Get the manager.

01:25:34.034 --> 01:25:36.309
That's strange.
He was booked for two days...

01:25:36.394 --> 01:25:39.989
...then just after 11:00,
he suddenly asks for his bill and leaves.

01:25:40.074 --> 01:25:44.147
He's got five hours start.
Put out an alert for the car.

01:26:02.314 --> 01:26:05.624
But Madame de Montpellier's bed
was slept in by two people?

01:26:06.034 --> 01:26:07.786
Yes, sir. Definitely.

01:26:07.994 --> 01:26:10.144
You can always tell.

01:26:10.314 --> 01:26:12.908
And you saw them in the lounge together?

01:26:13.114 --> 01:26:17.073
That is correct, sir.
I served them coffee and liqueur.

01:26:17.154 --> 01:26:19.065
They seemed very engrossed.

01:26:19.634 --> 01:26:22.228
- In what?
- In each other, sir.

01:26:22.354 --> 01:26:25.471
What did Mr. Duggan's luggage
consist of when he left?

01:26:25.794 --> 01:26:27.864
- Two bags.
- Nothing else?

01:26:27.954 --> 01:26:30.422
No parcels or packages of any kind?

01:26:30.514 --> 01:26:33.790
Just the two bags.
I carried them to his car.

01:26:33.954 --> 01:26:35.546
That will be all.

01:26:35.914 --> 01:26:38.667
- You photographed everything?
- Yes.

01:26:39.354 --> 01:26:42.471
Go over his room for fingerprints.
Send the stuff to Paris.

01:26:42.554 --> 01:26:44.909
I'll have a talk with the lady.

01:27:06.114 --> 01:27:09.345
There's more news.
They have a description of your car.

01:27:09.434 --> 01:27:11.425
Keep out of sight for a few days.

01:29:24.714 --> 01:29:27.228
- How's the lady?
- Very disturbed by all this.

01:29:27.314 --> 01:29:29.145
You told her nothing?

01:29:49.154 --> 01:29:51.714
I know nothing at all
about Mr. Duggan's whereabouts.

01:29:51.794 --> 01:29:53.785
We only met in the lounge of that hotel.

01:29:53.874 --> 01:29:56.946
- He joined me for coffee.
- What did he want?

01:29:59.314 --> 01:30:01.066
What did you talk about?

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:04.107
Social chit-chat.
I imagine he was trying to impress me.

01:30:04.194 --> 01:30:05.991
Why do you think that?

01:30:06.074 --> 01:30:08.872
Commissioner, please, we're not children.

01:30:09.554 --> 01:30:11.067
No, madam.

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:16.310
When you both met later,
was it only in your bedroom?

01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:22.390
- "Later"?
- Afterwards. After the coffee.

01:30:26.714 --> 01:30:30.707
Madam, be in no doubt
as to the seriousness of your position.

01:30:47.994 --> 01:30:50.588
We met in my bedroom. That's all.

01:30:52.594 --> 01:30:55.586
I'd never seen this man until yesterday.

01:30:55.954 --> 01:30:58.388
He doesn't even know my real name.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:14.590
I regret to say
that we have lost track of him.

01:32:14.714 --> 01:32:17.592
Temporarily, I hope.
But he simply disappeared.

01:32:22.034 --> 01:32:23.990
Could that mean he's changed his mind?

01:32:24.074 --> 01:32:26.030
We've obviously scared him off.

01:32:26.114 --> 01:32:28.264
Is it possible he's decided to give up?

01:32:28.354 --> 01:32:32.188
His only chance to escape
is to get across the border fast.

01:32:35.954 --> 01:32:38.593
I think he's still in France.

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:41.585
He may be waiting.

01:32:41.954 --> 01:32:43.990
- Waiting for what?
- I don't know.

01:32:44.394 --> 01:32:47.272
But I don't think we can assume
that he's given up.

01:33:51.114 --> 01:33:52.388
Good morning.

01:34:10.994 --> 01:34:13.269
Madam, there is a gentleman...

01:34:14.114 --> 01:34:15.547
Surprised?

01:34:16.314 --> 01:34:17.793
Thank you, Michel.

01:34:20.274 --> 01:34:23.744
- Do that later, Ernestine.
- Yes, madam.

01:34:33.754 --> 01:34:35.870
- Yes, I am surprised.
- Why?

01:34:36.154 --> 01:34:38.270
Your husband's still away, isn't he?

01:34:40.234 --> 01:34:42.065
Why did you come here?

01:34:42.314 --> 01:34:43.747
To see you.

01:34:44.914 --> 01:34:46.745
I had to.

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:48.188
But why?

01:34:51.594 --> 01:34:53.266
Does it matter?

01:35:33.554 --> 01:35:37.593
Make a search of hills,
farmhouses, cafes and hotels...

01:35:37.674 --> 01:35:41.110
...in a ten-kilometer radius
from the scene of the crash.

01:35:41.234 --> 01:35:44.829
Look for a fair-haired,
young foreigner with two suitcases.

01:35:45.034 --> 01:35:47.673
He may have been injured
and gone into hiding.

01:36:00.314 --> 01:36:03.590
The police were here yesterday
looking for you.

01:36:07.874 --> 01:36:10.434
Did they say they were coming back?

01:36:13.354 --> 01:36:15.743
Only that I should phone if...

01:36:19.674 --> 01:36:23.349
I know you stole that car.
It has a local license plate.

01:36:29.154 --> 01:36:32.032
I know it must be very serious.
I don't mind.

01:36:32.194 --> 01:36:34.469
You can tell me what you've done.

01:36:34.754 --> 01:36:36.824
You can stay here. It's safe.

01:36:36.914 --> 01:36:40.224
But you must tell me, Paul.
I won't say anything.

01:39:46.754 --> 01:39:48.745
Good-bye, Mr. Duggan.

01:40:09.594 --> 01:40:11.664
Your coffee, madam.

01:40:38.714 --> 01:40:40.227
Madam?

01:41:19.874 --> 01:41:22.911
Good morning.
A single ticket to Paris, please.

01:41:22.994 --> 01:41:24.985
- What class?
- Second.

01:41:26.434 --> 01:41:29.392
- How soon will the train be here?
- In an hour.

01:41:30.314 --> 01:41:32.191
Platform One.

01:41:50.074 --> 01:41:51.632
Your papers.

01:41:58.794 --> 01:42:01.354
- Danish?
- Please?

01:42:01.674 --> 01:42:03.266
- Denmark?
- Yes.

01:42:03.954 --> 01:42:05.433
What is your business here?

01:42:05.634 --> 01:42:07.909
I'm a schoolteacher on holiday.

01:42:53.074 --> 01:42:54.223
Madam?

01:44:16.754 --> 01:44:19.712
Commissioner, Madame de Montpellier
has been murdered!

01:44:20.114 --> 01:44:22.423
- Do they know who did it?
- It sounds like Duggan.

01:44:22.514 --> 01:44:26.143
He arrived at her place yesterday,
but disappeared again with her car.

01:44:26.234 --> 01:44:29.306
There's no need for secrecy.
It's a straight murder hunt now.

01:44:29.394 --> 01:44:32.750
Put out a general alert for Duggan.
Describe the car.

01:44:47.034 --> 01:44:50.310
6:30 time check.
Listen, I've found that car.

01:44:56.234 --> 01:44:58.828
The gendarmes by the station say
only three men...

01:44:58.914 --> 01:45:01.064
...boarded the midday train to Paris.

01:45:01.154 --> 01:45:02.382
Two were locals...

01:45:02.474 --> 01:45:06.149
...and the third was a teacher
traveling on a Danish passport.

01:45:06.234 --> 01:45:11.069
Age: about 34. Five feet ten,
brown hair, blue eyes.

01:45:11.394 --> 01:45:12.713
He can't remember the name.

01:45:12.914 --> 01:45:16.145
What time is that train due
at Austerlitz station?

01:45:16.474 --> 01:45:17.827
Ten past 7:00.

01:45:18.994 --> 01:45:20.347
Come on!

01:46:00.634 --> 01:46:03.194
- You know a good Turkish bath?
- Of course.

01:46:03.274 --> 01:46:04.673
Take me there.

01:47:40.354 --> 01:47:43.949
It's obvious that the Jackal
has been tipped off all along.

01:47:44.034 --> 01:47:47.026
And yet he's decided to go ahead,
regardless.

01:47:47.114 --> 01:47:50.072
He's simply challenged the whole lot of us.

01:47:50.674 --> 01:47:54.223
Are you suggesting there's a leak
from inside this room?

01:47:56.354 --> 01:47:57.787
I can't say.

01:47:58.114 --> 01:48:02.426
We think the Jackal is now in Paris
with a new name and face...

01:48:02.514 --> 01:48:05.392
...probably masquerading
as a Danish schoolteacher.

01:48:11.954 --> 01:48:12.784
Minister?

01:48:13.474 --> 01:48:16.830
Can you estimate how many Danes
might have entered Paris this afternoon?

01:48:17.114 --> 01:48:19.150
Several hundred at this time of the year.

01:48:19.234 --> 01:48:20.986
We must check on the men personally.

01:48:21.234 --> 01:48:24.465
I'll have every hotel visited
at midnight and 3:00 A.M.

01:48:24.554 --> 01:48:28.832
All registration cards will be collected.
Every likely Dane will be investigated.

01:48:28.914 --> 01:48:29.710
Good.

01:48:30.634 --> 01:48:35.867
In the meantime, I'll try to persuade the
President to cancel all public appearances.

01:49:17.274 --> 01:49:18.832
You're getting all steamed up.

01:49:18.914 --> 01:49:20.313
I think so.

01:49:21.514 --> 01:49:25.268
- I haven't seen you here before.
- No, I'm on holiday from Denmark.

01:49:25.354 --> 01:49:28.426
Really? I know Copenhagen very well.

01:49:29.754 --> 01:49:32.063
Unfortunately, I come from Silkeborg.

01:49:32.834 --> 01:49:34.711
It's a very small town.

01:49:38.474 --> 01:49:40.988
My name is Jules. Jules Bernard.

01:49:41.914 --> 01:49:43.825
Lundquist. Per Lundquist.

01:49:45.434 --> 01:49:47.902
Perhaps you' d like to come
for a drink at my home?

01:49:47.994 --> 01:49:49.791
I live quite nearby.

01:49:51.074 --> 01:49:52.905
That would be nice.

01:49:58.034 --> 01:50:01.390
So, this Jackal has
a Danish passport, right?

01:50:03.674 --> 01:50:06.347
- He must have got it somewhere.
- Yes.

01:50:12.474 --> 01:50:16.069
But if he's had to dye his hair,
it looks as if he stole it.

01:50:16.954 --> 01:50:18.103
Yes, go on.

01:50:19.634 --> 01:50:22.432
Since his trip to Paris in July,
he's been based in London.

01:50:22.514 --> 01:50:25.631
The chances are,
he stole it in one of those two places.

01:50:27.314 --> 01:50:30.272
What would you do if you were a Dane
and lost your passport?

01:50:30.354 --> 01:50:31.992
I'd go to the consulate.

01:50:32.874 --> 01:50:35.183
- Are you calling Superintendent Thomas?
- Yes.

01:50:35.594 --> 01:50:38.552
- Then the Danish Consul in Paris.
- Good.

01:50:49.474 --> 01:50:51.590
- How is it going?
- Not well.

01:50:51.874 --> 01:50:54.627
678 Danes arrived in Paris yesterday.

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:58.070
We're interviewing every man
about five feet eight.

01:50:58.274 --> 01:51:01.186
No Danish schoolteacher
has turned up though.

01:51:01.634 --> 01:51:04.944
- Have the list sent to my office.
- Right.

01:51:06.234 --> 01:51:07.952
You are quite right, sir.

01:51:08.114 --> 01:51:10.787
A Danish schoolteacher
had his passport stolen...

01:51:10.874 --> 01:51:13.911
...at London Airport on July 12.

01:51:13.994 --> 01:51:18.067
Name: Per Lundquist
of Copenhagen, age 33.

01:51:18.154 --> 01:51:22.670
Five feet ten,
chestnut brown hair, blue eyes.

01:51:22.794 --> 01:51:25.786
That's it! That's the one! Per Lundquist.

01:51:25.874 --> 01:51:28.434
Look him up. Yes?

01:51:31.754 --> 01:51:33.949
- There isn't one.
- What?

01:51:34.034 --> 01:51:35.865
One moment, Superintendent.

01:51:50.994 --> 01:51:52.473
I don't understand it.

01:51:52.554 --> 01:51:56.433
There isn't a Lundquist
on the hotels list. Not one.

01:52:02.594 --> 01:52:06.473
The following conversation
was recorded at 6:15 this morning.

01:52:06.954 --> 01:52:10.947
The number being dialed
was identified as MOLITOR 5901.

01:52:15.354 --> 01:52:17.504
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

01:52:18.274 --> 01:52:20.151
<i>- Denise.</i>
<i>- Valmy here.</i>

01:52:20.234 --> 01:52:22.190
<i>They know he's a Danish schoolteacher.</i>

01:52:22.474 --> 01:52:24.988
<i>They're visiting every hotel in Paris.</i>

01:52:26.794 --> 01:52:28.546
The contact was arrested an hour ago.

01:52:28.634 --> 01:52:31.831
Unfortunately,
the information came from this room.

01:52:34.394 --> 01:52:36.032
Whose voice was that?

01:52:40.274 --> 01:52:43.107
I regret to have to inform you, Minister...

01:52:43.194 --> 01:52:46.027
...that it was the voice of a friend of mine.

01:52:46.634 --> 01:52:49.068
She's staying with me at the moment.

01:52:51.914 --> 01:52:53.267
Excuse me.

01:53:02.634 --> 01:53:05.592
- I feel we owe you an apology.
- Thank you.

01:53:09.034 --> 01:53:11.753
I must report that the President
will not change his mind.

01:53:11.834 --> 01:53:13.347
Excuse me.

01:53:13.474 --> 01:53:16.944
It's occurred to me that we've got
two days to catch the Jackal.

01:53:17.194 --> 01:53:18.912
What? Why? How do you know?

01:53:19.194 --> 01:53:21.549
It was silly of me
not to have seen it before.

01:53:21.634 --> 01:53:25.229
Am I right that the President
has no engagements outside the palace...

01:53:25.314 --> 01:53:27.748
...today, tomorrow or Saturday?
- Nothing.

01:53:28.434 --> 01:53:30.390
And what is Sunday, August 25?

01:53:31.114 --> 01:53:32.786
Of course! Liberation Day!

01:53:33.434 --> 01:53:36.744
- That's what he's been waiting for.
- We have a little over 48 hours.

01:53:36.834 --> 01:53:38.950
We must have been blind, gentlemen.

01:53:39.554 --> 01:53:42.864
All we need is the passport
photograph of Per Lundquist.

01:53:43.034 --> 01:53:46.344
Copenhagen promised to send it
by this evening's conference.

01:53:49.794 --> 01:53:51.273
There is one thing.

01:53:52.394 --> 01:53:54.430
How did you know
whose telephone to tap?

01:53:54.514 --> 01:53:56.630
I didn't, so I tapped all of them.

01:54:07.914 --> 01:54:09.427
Are you home already?

01:54:19.474 --> 01:54:22.546
We now have the passport photograph
of Per Lundquist.

01:54:23.154 --> 01:54:24.985
The ban on publicity is off.

01:54:25.234 --> 01:54:27.464
This is now a straight murder hunt.

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:31.750
Lundquist's photo will appear
in the papers tomorrow morning.

01:54:31.834 --> 01:54:34.632
We'll have news flashes on TV
every 30 minutes.

01:54:34.954 --> 01:54:38.788
Every policeman and CRS man in Paris
will be on the street to check the papers...

01:54:38.874 --> 01:54:41.388
...of anyone remotely
resembling the suspect.

01:54:41.914 --> 01:54:43.905
Every detective will be called to help.

01:54:43.994 --> 01:54:46.872
- How many men does that make?
- Almost 100,000.

01:54:49.594 --> 01:54:51.346
- Commissioner Lebel.
- Yes?

01:54:51.434 --> 01:54:54.267
My congratulations
on the splendid job you've done.

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:56.504
We shall take over from now on.

01:54:57.154 --> 01:55:00.669
We need detain you no longer.
And, again, thank you.

01:55:41.994 --> 01:55:43.268
Did you see it?

01:55:44.194 --> 01:55:47.072
- What?
- Your face on the TV just now.

01:55:47.874 --> 01:55:50.832
- What do you mean?
- I was passing a TV rental shop...

01:55:50.914 --> 01:55:52.666
...and I saw your face.

01:55:52.794 --> 01:55:54.705
- No.
- Yes.

01:55:58.394 --> 01:56:00.225
Don't turn it off.

01:56:02.394 --> 01:56:04.624
- What was it about?
- I don't know.

01:56:04.714 --> 01:56:06.705
But I swear it was you.

01:56:09.074 --> 01:56:09.904
See?

01:56:16.034 --> 01:56:19.424
<i>We apologize for interrupting</i>
<i>with the following announcement.</i>

01:56:19.514 --> 01:56:23.029
<i>Police still searching for the murderer</i>
<i>of Madame de Montpellier.</i>

01:56:23.114 --> 01:56:26.470
<i>His name is Per Lundquist,</i>
<i>and this is his photograph.</i>

01:56:27.154 --> 01:56:30.908
<i>If you have seen this man,</i>
<i>contact the police immediately.</i>

01:57:07.074 --> 01:57:09.634
For God's sake, wake up, will you?

01:57:10.514 --> 01:57:12.823
The Minister wants to see you!

01:57:34.074 --> 01:57:37.066
We can't find him. He's vanished.

01:57:37.554 --> 01:57:39.988
Just disappeared off the face of the earth.

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:43.948
I don't think we had any idea
what kind of man...

01:57:44.034 --> 01:57:47.549
...you have been pursuing.
- What about tomorrow?

01:57:48.554 --> 01:57:51.432
The President rekindles
the eternal flame at 10:00.

01:57:51.634 --> 01:57:53.431
High mass is at 11:00.

01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:57.187
There's only one public ceremony
in the afternoon at 4:00.

01:57:58.114 --> 01:58:01.584
<i>He will present Liberation Medals</i>
<i>to veterans of the Resistance.</i>

01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:03.546
<i>What about crowd control?</i>

01:58:03.674 --> 01:58:07.269
<i>Crowds will be kept back</i>
<i>further than ever before.</i>

01:58:07.714 --> 01:58:10.706
<i>Steel barriers go up several hours</i>
<i>before each ceremony.</i>

01:58:10.994 --> 01:58:14.304
<i>Every house inside the barrier ring</i>
<i>is searched from top to bottom...</i>

01:58:14.394 --> 01:58:16.032
<i>... including the sewers.</i>

01:58:16.594 --> 01:58:19.870
<i>Police will be issued</i>
<i>special lapel badges at the last moment...</i>

01:58:19.954 --> 01:58:23.264
<i>... in case he tries to masquerade</i>
<i>as a security man.</i>

01:58:25.514 --> 01:58:27.709
<i>There'll be marksmen inside Notre Dame...</i>

01:58:27.794 --> 01:58:29.705
<i>... even among the congregation.</i>

01:58:30.834 --> 01:58:34.509
<i>The priests celebrating mass</i>
<i>will be searched for concealed weapons.</i>

01:58:38.834 --> 01:58:42.907
<i>We'll have firemen and marksmen on every</i>
<i>rooftop along the procession route.</i>

01:58:42.994 --> 01:58:45.633
<i>Dumont has drafted</i>
<i>a number of very tall officers...</i>

01:58:45.714 --> 01:58:48.547
<i>... to hedge around the President</i>
<i>without him noticing.</i>

02:06:14.994 --> 02:06:17.713
- Can I pass, please?
- What for?

02:06:17.794 --> 02:06:19.273
I live there.

02:06:19.834 --> 02:06:22.906
I have a room at 154.

02:06:25.034 --> 02:06:26.387
Papers.

02:06:47.714 --> 02:06:48.863
All right.

02:06:49.314 --> 02:06:50.667
Thank you.

02:07:15.434 --> 02:07:16.787
Excuse me, madam.

02:07:16.914 --> 02:07:19.428
Would you be so kind
as to give me a drink of water?

02:07:19.514 --> 02:07:22.472
Of course. Come in. Please come in.

02:07:22.554 --> 02:07:25.830
It's hot, waiting for the ceremony.

02:07:27.514 --> 02:07:29.345
Are you getting a medal today?

02:07:29.434 --> 02:07:32.551
I got mine two years ago with one of my...

02:12:45.954 --> 02:12:47.307
Top floor!

02:13:49.234 --> 02:13:51.270
What the hell do you think you're doing?

02:13:51.874 --> 02:13:54.308
- Who are you?
- Charles Calthrop.

02:13:54.394 --> 02:13:56.032
This is my bloody flat.

02:13:56.874 --> 02:13:59.229
I think you better come down
to the yard, sir.

02:13:59.314 --> 02:14:00.713
Too bloody right, I will.

02:14:04.634 --> 02:14:07.626
There's no question of the British
government ever concealing...

02:14:07.714 --> 02:14:10.274
...that this Jackal was an Englishman.

02:14:10.354 --> 02:14:11.833
So far as one can see...

02:14:11.914 --> 02:14:15.031
...there was a period when
an Englishman came under suspicion...

02:14:15.114 --> 02:14:17.230
...but he has now been cleared.

02:14:17.634 --> 02:14:20.102
<i>Certainly, the Jackal</i>
<i>masqueraded as an Englishman...</i>

02:14:20.194 --> 02:14:23.550
<i>... but he also masqueraded</i>
<i>as a Dane and as a Frenchman.</i>

02:14:23.834 --> 02:14:26.507
<i>So there's no way of proving</i>
<i>his identity at all.</i>

02:14:26.834 --> 02:14:28.950
<i>But if the Jackal wasn't Calthrop...</i>

02:14:29.034 --> 02:14:31.104
<i>... then who the hell was he?</i>

02:16:29.154 --> 02:16:31.145
