- Medici!
- This is a mistake!

01:18.920 --> 01:19.920
We're here for you.

01:20.920 --> 01:21.920
We'll support you.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.960
Rinaldo degli Albizzi.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.080
You have called this session...

01:41.160 --> 01:46.040
to present charges against
Cosimo de' Medici. Speak.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.840
And so the Medici begin to fall.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.520
- Not before time.
- Gentlemen!

01:56.120 --> 01:57.880
Signor Cosimo de' Medici...

01:58.800 --> 02:01.440
was arrested on the charge
of having his servant...

02:02.760 --> 02:05.480
break into the house
of the late Lupo Corona.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.280
Since his arrest though,

02:08.360 --> 02:11.880
evidence has emerged
of a far graver charge...

02:13.160 --> 02:16.240
against a man many of us
have considered a friend.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.040
Cosimo de' Medici means
to make himself out a tyrant.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.720
There's only one answer
to the charge of treason...

02:28.800 --> 02:30.160
Death to the traitor.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.680
Free Cosimo!

02:35.760 --> 02:36.880
Bastard!

02:38.520 --> 02:40.000
- Kill the usurer!
- Bastard!

02:44.320 --> 02:45.440
Cosimo de' Medici.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.680
How do you answer
Signor Rinaldo's charges?

02:55.560 --> 02:57.000
They are baseless.

02:57.760 --> 03:02.080
Born of an old and personal rivalry.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.200
I'm a loyal citizen of Florence.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.800
I am innocent.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.040
The Signoria will test the charges.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.680
- The trial begins tomorrow.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.640
In the Calcio Game, you must show honor.
No tricks, no cheating.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.160
Some of those players are huge, Father.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.240
And poor Cosimo
is only trained in bookkeeping.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.720
--Boys, boys! Listen!

03:40.800 --> 03:43.800
Always allow them to take the lead.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.040
- Ah!
- Giovanni de' Medici. Welcome.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.600
You do me honor to allow my boys to play
on your team, Signor Albizzi.

03:54.680 --> 03:59.120
-You know my son, Rinaldo?
-I see the money has arrived.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.560
We are grateful for this opportunity
to support you.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.920
Good luck.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.840
Go! Go!

04:58.560 --> 05:00.120
We're being attacked by our own team!

05:00.200 --> 05:03.800
Rinaldo robbed the ball from Cosimo.
Welcome to the nobility, eh?

05:03.880 --> 05:07.440
-I want you to befriend Rinaldo.
-Why should he? Rinaldo's a snake.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.720
- You make alliances with powerful men.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.560
-Yes?
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.920
-Go. Go.
-Okay.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.000
--Give me the ball!

05:23.080 --> 05:25.840
Pass! I can score! Give me the ball!

05:27.640 --> 05:30.400
-Rinaldo!
-Ah!

05:33.880 --> 05:36.480
We need this point! You see that brute?

05:36.560 --> 05:38.240
-Distract him while I run.
-How?

05:38.320 --> 05:39.920
I don't know! Anything! Punch him!

05:40.000 --> 05:41.520
-Kick him in the balls!
-Cheat?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.880
I'll light a candle for your soul at mass.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.760
Now that was cheating.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.720
-And you know what's worse than cheating?
-What?

06:17.680 --> 06:20.040
- Losing.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.840
--Yes!

06:27.840 --> 06:30.800
Why would you allow him
to go alone to the Signoria, Marco Bello?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.680
You know your brother.
I couldn't stop him.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.440
- You could have gone with him.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.960
I just wanted to hear
what Piero was saying.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.240
- What do you think we should do?
- So let's hear.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.920
I'm sure you did not mean to start
this family meeting without us.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.680
Contessina, why did Cosimo
go to the Signoria?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.560
He was summoned.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.240
He thought Rinaldo
would challenge him out in the open.

06:58.320 --> 07:02.280
The treason charge is trumped up.
A fair trial will acquit Father.

07:02.360 --> 07:06.080
Do not imagine
that our great republic is a democracy.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.160
The Signoria is run
on loyalties and patronage.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.600
Those can be bought.
Our coffers are filling again.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.560
Albizzi calls our money "dirty gold."

07:15.600 --> 07:18.800
Anyone foolish enough to take it
could be next in the dock.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.040
Now things could get dangerous fast,
and we must react.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.040
With force, if necessary.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.600
That sounds like exactly the way
to make things dangerous fast!

07:27.680 --> 07:31.200
- I'm only suggesting that we prepare.
- What support do we have?

07:32.000 --> 07:36.240
There are 50 men in the Signoria.
It's evenly split, more or less.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.920
Surely Cosimo is popular
after what he did during the plague.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.120
Rinaldo is rallying the nobles
to his cause.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.400
Offering them positions of power
in a new Signoria,

07:45.480 --> 07:49.360
which he means to control after...
Cosimo is executed.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.360
Rinaldo can't just have a man killed
to order. He must follow the law.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.160
And so we must win. And I'll gather
evidence in father's favor.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.560
Where have you--?

08:29.240 --> 08:32.400
-I lost this weeks ago.
-I thought you might want it back.

08:37.960 --> 08:38.960
Thank you.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.840
-Did you deliver my message?
-Yes, Messer.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.880
She's here.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.360
Piero is gathering evidence.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.480
He will be in the Signoria today.
They all will.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.320
Aren't you worried?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.760
An innocent man fears nothing.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.200
Albizzi is determined. Lorenzo told me--

09:25.280 --> 09:27.640
I trust the city of Florence
to find the truth.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.200
I do.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.240
But now and then,
the truth needs a little help to be told.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.760
Do you remember Sandro Tarugi?

09:35.840 --> 09:37.480
And he was loyal to my father,

09:37.560 --> 09:39.360
but I saw him
in the Signoria with Rinaldo,

09:39.440 --> 09:42.360
which means he has switched sides.
I need you to get this to him.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.640
Between the guilds and merchants
that lent land from him,

09:45.720 --> 09:47.840
he has influence
over eight to ten merchants.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.360
-Enough to win?
-It could be.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.720
Madonna, you must go.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.200
Trust Florence. Trust me.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.520
Cosimo de' Medici's treason
has taken three forms.

10:23.480 --> 10:24.720
First,

10:26.400 --> 10:27.920
degeneracy.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.800
He may say that the painting and sculpture
he has bought into Florence

10:34.880 --> 10:36.400
is for the glory of God!

10:36.480 --> 10:42.080
But I will show he has corrupted
our morals with idolatrous art.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.800
He has filled our city
with artists of low character.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.160
Even Sodomites!

10:49.240 --> 10:51.360
--Yes!

10:51.440 --> 10:54.160
This is what he calls art.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.240
David, symbol of Florence.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.800
- Shown as a naked catamite.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.120
Second!

11:06.120 --> 11:09.280
Usury. Money lending for profit.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.880
We know Cosimo de' Medici
is the richest man in the city.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.240
And we know he is banker to the Pope.

11:15.320 --> 11:19.680
But I will show he has used his connection
to Rome to cover the fact

11:19.760 --> 11:23.000
he commits the sin of usury on the side.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.720
--He has corrupted the rules of Christ!

11:26.800 --> 11:30.680
To charge interest.
He even charged one convent

11:30.760 --> 11:35.200
50 Florins on a loan for a new hall
to provide meals for the poor.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.440
Third!

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Tyranny.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.440
Cosimo de' Medici has great wealth.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.200
And with it, has bought power.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.480
Too much power.

11:58.560 --> 12:01.920
He presents himself
as the savior of this city,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.920
building his dome atop our cathedral,
treating the sick there during the plague.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.320
This is part of the plot.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.240
If he is not stopped,

12:11.320 --> 12:14.640
he will overthrow the Republic of Florence
and rule as a prince!

12:14.720 --> 12:18.000
During the plague, it was you,
Rinaldo degli Albizzi,

12:18.080 --> 12:19.720
who tried to take control over the city.

12:19.800 --> 12:24.000
Hear how Lorenzo de' Medici
tries to hide his brother's guilt.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.760
I performed my civic duty
in a time of crisis.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.960
But I am not... Florence's master.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.880
I am her servant.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.600
How is he?

12:57.680 --> 13:01.000
Confident in justice.
I'm delivering this to Sandro Tarugi.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.800
Sandro's wife Maria
is a friend of my mother's.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.720
-I've known her since I was a child.
-Then you can come with me.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.520
A man who turned once
could be turned again.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.000
Lorenzo said we can't bribe people.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.680
-The thing about dirty gold?
-It's still gold.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.880
The charges against
my father are inflated.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.360
But there's one thing
I think we can disprove.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.200
Rinaldo said my father
charged a convent 50 Florins

13:25.280 --> 13:29.120
- for a hall to serve meals for the poor.
- Which convent did he say?

13:29.200 --> 13:32.440
He didn't. Do we have records?

13:32.520 --> 13:36.320
Of course. But he lent money to convents
all over Italy without more clues.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.720
If I can just prove Rinaldo's wrong
on this one point,

13:38.800 --> 13:40.760
it could undermine his case.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.640
I'm here to see Maria Tarugi.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.280
Ah, here are the records.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.160
Clerical accounts...

14:06.120 --> 14:07.640
Everything's here.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.120
It's gonna be a long night.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.440
-Lucrezia...
-Monna Maria.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.120
You look so well.
What a beautiful dress.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.120
I had the silk sent from Venice.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.880
Florentine merchants can never
keep up with the latest styles.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.240
-Uh, you know my mother-in-law?
-Madonna Contessina.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.560
-It's been so long since we spoke.
-True.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.360
Monna Maria, we know...

14:33.440 --> 14:36.320
your husband Sandro
commands influence in the Signoria

14:36.400 --> 14:40.160
and we are trying to save
the life of an innocent man.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.400
Could you give this letter to Sandro?

14:42.480 --> 14:45.440
Tell him we depend on his loyalty.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.480
Of course.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.520
-I'll do what I can.
-You have our deepest gratitude.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.800
What are you doing? Stop!

15:26.880 --> 15:28.200
I need this.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.280
--Hands.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.840
-Where's my jailer?
-He's been replaced.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.960
-And who are you?
-Federigo Malavolti.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.160
Mastro Malavolti,
my family will send you money

15:51.240 --> 15:53.400
if you allow me paper and ink.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.600
-I'm a wealthy man!
-I know what you are.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.880
A leech growing fat
on the blood of the people.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.720
Our Lord threw the money lenders
out of the temple.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.000
Now it is your turn to face justice.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.080
Comfortable?

16:17.600 --> 16:19.760
You know your charge is false.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.480
Now you cut me off from those
who might prove my innocence.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.760
You sent a letter in a flagrant attempt

16:24.840 --> 16:29.200
to bias a member of the Signoria
in your favor, so no more letters.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.840
Why not just kill me?

16:31.640 --> 16:33.720
Have me stabbed in an alley.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.840
Throw off the Campanile.
You're not above that, are you?

16:36.520 --> 16:40.280
-Why this performance with the Signoria?
-Because there will be others like you.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.240
Men with a lust for power,
who would turn the world upside down,

16:46.320 --> 16:50.520
so the nobles must crawl on their bellies,
while the peasants and merchants rule.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.680
Men like you have no care for tradition
or the natural order of society.

17:02.600 --> 17:07.040
Noble power is ordained
by God himself. We exist to rule.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.200
Your family has tried for years
to take mine down.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.160
-That must end.
-Rinaldo...

17:20.520 --> 17:22.560
Twenty years, Rinaldo.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.480
Twenty years ago, I had a part to play
in what my father did,

17:25.560 --> 17:28.200
but I did not know I was being used.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.360
I am truly sorry.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.640
And 20 years too late.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.840
- Rinaldo!

17:47.560 --> 17:49.200
The old order is changing.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.640
Money is what matters now.
And the nobles don't have it. You do.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.800
The great Albizzi
have nothing to fear from us.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.760
-I'm not so sure.
-You can't be serious.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.680
We had lands, of course,
made money from rent and taxes.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.600
But times have been hard.
Droughts, plagues.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.000
Some estates are left empty for years.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.840
The houses fall down,
the fields overgrow.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.800
-Your father has investments.
-The granaries did well for a while.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.600
But prices are low in Florence this year.

18:21.680 --> 18:26.360
-Well, sell your grain elsewhere.
-We do. That's worse.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.920
We made a good deal.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.880
Sold enough grain to Rome
to cover three more months of operation.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
The ship was sailing back last week.
You remember those storms?

18:40.960 --> 18:44.160
It sank on its way up the coast.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.080
All I've got in my own name is a vineyard.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.840
I love the place.
Built it up from nothing.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.160
But I'll have to sell it.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.040
Your father is a wise man,
I can't believe it will come to that.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.160
Too much talking.
Let's drink to our next victory.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.760
You wanted to see me, Father?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.720
I understand you made a friendship. Hmm.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.560
-With the Albizzi boy.
-I misjudged him at first.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.760
-I thought him arrogant.
-And...?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.680
- What is he?

19:26.760 --> 19:28.320
He's insecure.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.680
What makes you say that?

19:33.280 --> 19:36.640
-He's fearful about the future.
-Hmm...

19:36.720 --> 19:38.080
Is it money?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.480
The grain business?

19:42.920 --> 19:43.920
They lost a ship.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
Unfortunate.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.400
You did well to listen to him.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.160
Thank you, Father.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.640
Albizzi has changed the guard.
Shut us out of Cosimo's cell.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.880
-Why?
-Maria Tarugi.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.680
I gave her a letter
from Cosimo for her husband.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.480
- It seems she took it to Albizzi instead.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.600
-We need troops.
-Too dangerous.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.920
We have to start thinking about
defending ourselves, not just him.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.440
Where's Piero?

20:47.720 --> 20:50.400
Still in the bank.
Going through the evidence.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.960
-We must try the legitimate route.
-Yes, he's your son, I understand.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.280
But this is not the time
for learning exercise.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.720
At least he's doing something!

20:59.800 --> 21:02.880
While you lie in bed dreaming of Rosa!

21:12.760 --> 21:16.000
-Lorenzo, good morning.
-I need a bill of exchange.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.720
-How much?
-Fifty thousand Florins.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.640
So much?

21:23.720 --> 21:27.240
Cosimo cannot make
the decisions now, so I must.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.920
Which branch
shall I make the bill payable to?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.680
I'll complete that later.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.840
Sandro Tarugi!

21:54.920 --> 21:57.120
What the hell is this?
You can't be in here.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.920
True. Thankfully nor can your wife.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.520
- What do you want?
- To talk.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.800
Florence has always
respected you, Sandro.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.240
It is sad to see
you ruin your reputation

22:13.320 --> 22:15.160
by siding with the Albizzi.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.880
Rinaldo is gathering
the nobles to his cause.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.600
-My wife and I--
-Can't you make a decision without Maria?

22:23.880 --> 22:27.040
You know Medici money can do more
for your family than noble favor.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.800
I have access to Cosimo's accounts.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.120
Maria will see the sense of it
when you show her the Montelupo vineyard.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.920
The best vineyard in Tuscany.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.320
Cosimo will speak
in his own defense today.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.000
You know what to do.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.640
Stand up and show you're a man.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.920
Madonna? A word.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.280
Lorenzo came into the bank this morning.
He took a bill on a large sum.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.800
-How much?
-Fifty thousand.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.600
What? Where is he?

23:03.680 --> 23:06.560
Well, that's the problem. I don't know.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.960
Good morning.

23:40.560 --> 23:45.320
-Why are you so loyal to Rinaldo?
-Signor Rinaldo is a god-fearing man.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.920
-A man of justice.
-A man who would...

23:50.000 --> 23:52.560
murder his enemies
by bearing false witness?

23:52.640 --> 23:56.000
A man who would pull down
the house of God?

23:56.920 --> 24:00.760
Does our Lord truly forgive all sins,
Mastro Malavolti?

24:01.520 --> 24:03.800
For those who sincerely repent.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.480
Do we not all sometimes do...

24:12.040 --> 24:15.000
bad things in service of a greater good?

24:18.080 --> 24:22.520
Well, you have sinned.
You must beg the Lord for his forgiveness.

24:22.600 --> 24:26.880
I tried all last night
but without a priest...

24:26.960 --> 24:28.960
No visitors.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.440
Signor Maso degli Albizzi!

24:40.600 --> 24:43.600
Signor Maso degli Albizzi!

24:43.680 --> 24:46.240
The clerks of the Signoria
have just received this letter.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.880
What is this?

24:47.960 --> 24:51.000
A bankrupt cannot be a member
of the Signoria, Signor Maso.

24:51.080 --> 24:55.280
Is it true? Did you lose a ship
carrying three months' revenue?

24:57.720 --> 25:01.040
-How dare you spread such lies?
-Our duty is to Florence.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.960
Will you provide accounts to disprove it?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.800
- I need time.
- Until you do,

25:07.880 --> 25:09.560
you are no longer
a member of the Signoria.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
Good day, messers.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.920
You used me.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.840
The Albizzi have grown weak.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.920
Maso Albizzi hopes to regain
his riches through trade.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.360
But he has no head for it.

25:44.440 --> 25:48.040
He should have insured his grain
before shipping it out.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.800
-What about honor? My honor?
-Stop talking about yourself.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.840
We're talking about
the future of Florence.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.760
The Albizzis have enfeebled themselves
by decades of easy privilege

25:58.840 --> 26:02.320
and the city stagnates
under their influence.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.240
But the world is changing.

26:04.320 --> 26:09.120
And Florence must seize its place.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.640
For the new leaders to rise,
the old must fall.

26:14.760 --> 26:15.760
I'm proud of you.

26:20.320 --> 26:25.160
It has hurt you
to make this personal sacrifice,

26:25.240 --> 26:27.800
but it has spared Florence.

26:29.680 --> 26:35.440
One day, when I'm gone,
you will be head of the Medici family.

26:39.920 --> 26:44.240
And you must lead us.
For the glory of Florence.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.040
I think I found it. Look.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.160
It's time. Pull yourself together.

27:44.320 --> 27:49.280
The case for the defense...
Cosimo de' Medici.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.800
I love our great city of Florence.

27:57.880 --> 28:01.320
Above all else, I must res--

28:01.400 --> 28:06.160
I must defend myself against
these slanderous... charges.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.480
I must defend my...

28:08.360 --> 28:09.400
I...

28:11.120 --> 28:13.000
The world must...

28:13.080 --> 28:15.080
The world must see...

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
I...

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
Ah...

28:22.280 --> 28:23.280
I...

28:24.320 --> 28:26.840
Please, please...

28:35.920 --> 28:36.920
He's taken ill.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.280
This is another Medici trick.

28:40.360 --> 28:45.240
We can't continue
if the defendant is not represented.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.520
I will speak for my father.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.720
I am his blood.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.120
No, let the boy speak.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.400
- This should be entertaining.

29:03.480 --> 29:07.920
Cosimo de' Medici,
will you be represented by your son?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.280
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned

29:18.360 --> 29:21.240
against heaven, and against you.

29:21.320 --> 29:25.680
I repent. I repent against
all my sins and trespasses.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.920
Forgive me, Father. I repent...

29:28.000 --> 29:29.640
He cannot answer.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.920
In that case,
you may speak on behalf of your father.

29:56.040 --> 30:01.440
My father has declared
his love for Florence.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.400
You can see he is a patriot.
Not a traitor.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.480
Rinaldo degli Albizzi...

30:09.440 --> 30:12.920
charged that my father made a profit
of 50 Florins on a loan

30:13.000 --> 30:15.200
to a convent for a hall to feed the poor.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.640
The Medici bank
does not engage in usury!

30:20.240 --> 30:22.160
Interest is neither paid, nor taken!

30:22.240 --> 30:25.560
No. You run it out
of the kindness of your hearts.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.120
I have the accounts...

30:32.920 --> 30:35.320
The accounts of the Convent
of San Benedetto.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.520
And this is the only convent
in our records,

30:38.600 --> 30:40.040
which took money for a dining hall.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.120
And the accounts show, quite clearly,

30:43.200 --> 30:45.440
that the Medici bank
made the convent a gift

30:45.520 --> 30:48.080
of 65 Florins. Not 50.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.480
And there was no interest charged.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.120
Cosimo de' Medici made a donation.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.960
Young man, how do we know
you did not draw up this...

31:00.040 --> 31:02.040
remarkably convenient
document yourself?

31:02.120 --> 31:04.120
It has the official Medici seal.

31:04.200 --> 31:07.880
Which you keep in the bank.
You could have faked that too.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.600
The people of Florence have
had enough of banker's tricks.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.880
Our business is legitimate!

31:22.080 --> 31:24.080
Cosimo de' Medici
must be found innocent.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.520
Gentlemen of the Signoria!

31:36.520 --> 31:39.440
- Signor Guadagni...
- Signor Tarugi...

31:39.520 --> 31:43.520
With his defense,
Piero de' Medici has convinced me.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.120
I say Cosimo is innocent.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.240
Hear, hear!

31:50.320 --> 31:52.960
- Sandro Tarugi speaks the truth!
- Cosimo is innocent!

31:53.040 --> 31:56.960
Acquit Cosimo!
Cosimo has done no wrong!

31:57.040 --> 31:59.480
-This is rigged.
-We must put it to a vote.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.880
We can't let them vote now.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.920
Order! Order!

32:10.280 --> 32:12.280
I demand order in the Signoria!

32:14.760 --> 32:16.880
If you can't come to order,
this court is adjourned!

32:23.440 --> 32:25.840
--By all saints...

32:25.920 --> 32:28.480
-You were paid to poison my wine.
-Get up.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.480
You're a man of such faith, Malavolti.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.360
I didn't think you could be bought.
And by Rinaldo.

32:41.440 --> 32:46.520
Is this the work of a God-fearing man?
A man of justice?

32:53.600 --> 32:58.120
I may not have long left.
Please, let me see my wife one last time.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.800
-I was told no visitors.
-Only to say goodbye.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.320
Please.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.360
- What did they give you?
- I don't know what you mean.

33:19.720 --> 33:22.920
- Don't lie to me.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.800
Arrest this man for corruption.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.680
On what evidence?
I'm a member of the Signoria!

33:26.760 --> 33:28.720
Get your hands off of me! Get off!

33:29.800 --> 33:31.480
Our Signoria needs protection.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.080
And they've just given me
the perfect excuse.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.280
I thought I would
lose the whole case, but...

33:40.360 --> 33:41.560
then they began to stand up.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.760
"Free Cosimo!" "Cosimo is innocent!"

33:44.840 --> 33:48.280
Even Sandro Tarugi himself.
I can't believe it worked.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.560
You did everything that was required.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.400
-I'm so sorry, monna. I couldn't stop her.
-You bitch!

33:53.480 --> 33:56.000
My husband is in jail tonight
because of you.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.080
Emilia, call the guards.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.120
Albizzi had him arrested for corruption
because you bribed him.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.640
Who did you think could believe it

34:01.720 --> 34:03.960
with that half-wit son of yours
burbling on the stand?

34:04.040 --> 34:07.440
Albizzi stopped me from seeing my husband
because of the letter that you gave him.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.960
You were a noblewoman, Contessina,
until you married that tradesman.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.160
- Tradesman?
- Yes.

34:12.240 --> 34:14.920
Some of the nobles
have continued to tolerate you

34:15.000 --> 34:17.160
only because Cosimo is so filthy rich

34:17.240 --> 34:20.160
that their greed overcomes
their sense of proper decorum.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.400
Well, that ends tonight.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.600
I'll see to it that you're never received
by the society of this city again.

34:34.920 --> 34:35.920
You bribed him!

34:36.000 --> 34:39.080
-I didn't know that you'd have to speak.
-You let me believe I was a success.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.160
We didn't mean to deceive you.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.200
You too?

34:53.280 --> 34:55.640
Albizzi guards are in the Signoria.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.120
-Albizzi will fix the trial.
-Yes.

35:01.240 --> 35:03.840
-Where is Lorenzo?
-Still no sign.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.400
I'm defending my father.
I need to get into the chamber.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.000
Not today. Albizzi orders.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.960
-Signor Guadagni...
-They refuse to let us in.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.880
Guadagni, we need a verdict.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.680
-Is this your doing?
-Democracy must be protected.

35:33.760 --> 35:38.520
-Your guards won't let people vote.
-The Medici have tried to rig this trial.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.280
They have forfeited their place
in the Signoria.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.680
We cannot function under occupation.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.800
Stay here. I'll fetch our men.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.240
Go to Bernardo Guadagni at the Signoria.

36:28.240 --> 36:34.320
Tell him that Lorenzo de' Medici
is here with Francesco Sforza's army!

36:34.400 --> 36:37.800
We have 1,000 cavalry!

36:37.880 --> 36:42.520
Ten thousand men!
Trebuchets and siege towers!

36:44.520 --> 36:45.600
Our terms...

36:46.800 --> 36:49.280
Cosimo de' Medici must be released!

36:56.640 --> 36:58.480
You should hurry.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.080
We invade at midnight!

37:09.600 --> 37:14.760
Lorenzo demands that you two leave
Florence immediately and never return.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.480
If you don't go by midnight,
he'll force you out.

37:22.960 --> 37:26.040
What more proof do you need?

37:26.120 --> 37:28.040
That the Medici are tyrants?

37:39.560 --> 37:41.040
Cosimo.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.560
The guards change fast. Don't be long.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.480
Lorenzo has bought
Francesco Sforza's army.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.160
They've surrounded us.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.200
Guadagni's refusing to convene the trial,

37:53.280 --> 37:55.320
but if Lorenzo invades,
you'll be a hostage.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.640
Rinaldo may not wait for a verdict
to have you executed.

37:58.760 --> 38:02.120
If Lorenzo invades, he could win.
It's our best hope.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.600
Rinaldo or his son might escape.

38:05.680 --> 38:09.760
Once the fighting is done,
find Ugo or Marco. They will help you.

38:11.280 --> 38:16.240
-No, you will help me.
-No. You are right.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.960
If Lorenzo invades,
Rinaldo will have me killed.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.680
That is if the guard
doesn't poison me to death first.

38:24.840 --> 38:29.320
We have to get you out of here.
The family cannot survive without you.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.000
It can and will.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.240
I have repented my sins,
so I do not fear death.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.960
All that matters is to win back Florence.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.680
Don't talk like this. There is still hope.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.760
-We will get you out! There is time!
-No. Listen!

38:49.840 --> 38:53.440
You must buy up Rinaldo's debts
across Italy. All of them.

38:53.520 --> 38:57.960
We must bankrupt them
as my father once did, only everywhere.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.720
It may take years, generations.
It does not matter.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.920
The Albizzi must never challenge us again.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.800
There is no "us" if you are gone.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.800
If the Medici are to shape history,

39:14.560 --> 39:17.680
we must live beyond our lifetimes.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.240
The whole tree does not die
because one branch falls.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.080
--Farewell.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.040
Don't...

39:32.440 --> 39:33.720
-Piero...
-No...

39:33.800 --> 39:38.120
Lucrezia, Lorenzo,
they need you now. As I have.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.680
I know all you have done for me,
Contessina.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.640
Thank you.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.800
You must go.

39:55.720 --> 39:58.080
- You must go.
- No.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.320
- Come on.
- Cosimo...

39:59.400 --> 40:00.840
- You have to leave.
- Cosimo!

40:02.240 --> 40:03.520
Cosimo!

40:10.080 --> 40:12.840
Cosimo de' Medici is indisposed.

40:12.920 --> 40:16.280
In these extraordinary circumstances,

40:17.040 --> 40:20.400
the question of his guilt
must be put to the vote.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.160
Albizzi has forced Guadagni
to convene the Signoria.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.400
Cosimo has been found guilty.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.120
He will be executed at midnight.

40:40.200 --> 40:44.560
He told me what I should do
after his death. It was all very logical.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.680
He believes the family
is what matters, not just him.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.760
I can't let him die.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.720
Thank you for letting me see her.

41:44.080 --> 41:48.080
I heard you in the Signoria...
talking to God.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.160
You repented.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.680
I, too, have sinned.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.160
This is what I used to poison you.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.120
This is mine.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.320
You see? It's clean.

42:25.840 --> 42:26.920
Drink.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.520
Malavolti?

42:39.680 --> 42:40.880
Yes?

42:42.160 --> 42:44.240
I forgive you.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.560
Cosimo has been found guilty.
They're planning to execute him tonight.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.160
If they kill him,
I will burn that city to the ground.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.280
Burn Florence?

43:26.200 --> 43:28.360
-You can't.
-Tell the family to leave.

43:28.440 --> 43:31.720
Even if you don't care how many
people die, our bank is there, the gold.

43:31.800 --> 43:35.080
-You can't destroy everything!
-Then Albizzi will have to negotiate.

43:35.800 --> 43:38.440
-And what if he doesn't?
-Cosimo knows the risks.

43:40.440 --> 43:43.000
The Medici must always prevail.

43:43.080 --> 43:46.200
Everything else...
everything can be sacrificed.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.320
Cosimo believes this family
will survive without him, but it won't.

43:53.560 --> 43:55.880
You are not the man he is
and you know that.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.400
On second thoughts, Sforza,

44:03.160 --> 44:04.600
how soon can we move?

44:07.920 --> 44:08.920
Before sundown.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.120
If we have to.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.560
Then I will take Albizzi's head.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.280
Lorenzo. Lorenzo!

44:48.760 --> 44:51.240
Come back! You can't go in there!

44:51.320 --> 44:52.560
As the city's new commander,

44:52.640 --> 44:54.520
I pledge to defend Florence
to the death.

45:05.600 --> 45:07.200
Gentlemen!

45:07.280 --> 45:10.400
I have just spoken with Francesco Sforza,
whose army surrounds us...

45:11.160 --> 45:12.960
and with Lorenzo de' Medici.

45:13.040 --> 45:17.680
If you execute my husband,
Lorenzo will attack us with fire.

45:17.760 --> 45:21.000
Guadagni, you must throw her out!
Women cannot be in here!

45:21.080 --> 45:22.840
--Order!

45:25.760 --> 45:28.080
- Get out of here!
- Order!

45:28.160 --> 45:31.840
If she has spoken to the army,
I intend to listen.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.840
Sforza wants only the release
of Cosimo de' Medici.

45:37.240 --> 45:40.880
Every man in this chamber
owes Cosimo something.

45:41.640 --> 45:45.720
He has bailed out guilds.
He has sponsored merchants.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.880
He has helped nobles,

45:47.960 --> 45:51.280
including Rinaldo Albizzi's own father,
settle their debts.

45:51.360 --> 45:52.680
- By thievery!
- No!

45:53.960 --> 45:55.880
--No! By fair...

45:55.960 --> 45:57.920
and honest trades!

45:59.400 --> 46:03.480
You think noble blood entitles you
to rule the world. Not anymore.

46:05.400 --> 46:11.800
Florence cannot go back into the past,
where nobles ruled and peasants bowed.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.320
This republic is building itself
to greatness.

46:16.440 --> 46:21.120
Not on the finery of its aristocrats.
But on the talents of its people!

46:23.840 --> 46:27.160
Cosimo's life
has been dedicated to this city.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.800
And now you must save them both!

46:31.880 --> 46:35.520
How can you talk of saving Florence
when Lorenzo threatens to burn it down?

46:35.600 --> 46:37.400
--Yes! Yes!

46:38.560 --> 46:41.880
The army will go if Cosimo is freed.
I have Sforza's word.

46:41.960 --> 46:44.480
Sforza is a mercenary.
His word is worthless.

46:44.560 --> 46:47.560
Cosimo de' Medici
was found guilty by this court!

46:47.640 --> 46:49.520
His sentence will be carried out!

46:49.600 --> 46:51.680
Guards, prepare the prisoner
for execution.

46:51.760 --> 46:53.800
--No! No!

46:55.600 --> 46:57.560
Let me take him out of the city!

46:57.640 --> 46:59.880
- We will go into exile!
- Guards!

46:59.960 --> 47:01.800
- Halt!
- Exile?

47:01.880 --> 47:04.960
More trickery! She thinks we're fools!

47:05.040 --> 47:06.440
That army could sack the city.

47:06.520 --> 47:09.080
And it will be your fault, Rinaldo!
This city will be destroyed!

47:10.400 --> 47:12.560
Exile may not be what you want, Rinaldo.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.720
But it does mean we get to live. Accept.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.280
-No.
-Then I will put it to the vote.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.560
Can you stand?

47:56.760 --> 47:59.360
We must go now. Prepare for our departure.

47:59.440 --> 48:00.600
Departure?

48:00.680 --> 48:03.600
You were sentenced to death.
But I persuaded them to commute it.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.240
You are exiled.

48:08.240 --> 48:09.240
Exiled?

48:12.160 --> 48:13.160
What have you done?

48:14.600 --> 48:15.840
I saved your life.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.840
I was ready to die.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.400
I couldn't lose you.

48:21.480 --> 48:26.240
How could you put your own needs
before the good of my family?

48:26.320 --> 48:29.800
If we have lost Florence,
the Medici are ruined!

48:56.280 --> 48:59.200
When you arrive in Venice,
call on Elisa Morosini.

48:59.280 --> 49:02.640
She's an old friend of my family.
She will introduce you to society.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.120
Can you really not come with us?

49:07.200 --> 49:09.200
Someone must stay here
to look after our affairs.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.840
My own father was exiled.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.520
I know the pain of being cast out.

49:22.480 --> 49:25.440
Piero and I could stay
and manage the household here.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.120
Piero could run the bank.

49:28.080 --> 49:31.200
God knows he needs
to be given more responsibility.

49:32.600 --> 49:36.160
Monna... Your husband calls for you.

50:13.680 --> 50:15.320
I've left instructions for the bank staff.

50:16.400 --> 50:20.040
There are some notes here for you.
If anything is unclear, send word to Ugo.

50:22.880 --> 50:24.560
I know you are angry.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.800
But if we leave it broken
like this between us,

50:30.800 --> 50:32.280
we will grow into the break.

50:34.960 --> 50:37.000
Please let me come
with you and the family.

50:54.280 --> 50:55.840
Please, my love.

51:21.520 --> 51:24.160
How much did you have
to pay Sforza in the end?

51:24.240 --> 51:27.440
Ten thousand. But he wasn't very happy.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.720
Hopefully, we'll keep him
from coming to Venice.

51:29.800 --> 51:32.200
- Cosimo...

51:32.280 --> 51:33.600
We're ready to go.

51:35.440 --> 51:37.840
Are you sure that you have
everything you need?

51:41.640 --> 51:43.640
All I have left in the world.
