WEBVTT

00:01.831 --> 00:03.276
Excuse me.

00:03.812 --> 00:05.447
- Are you Leslie Knope?
- Yes.

00:05.481 --> 00:06.948
We are part of a group

00:06.982 --> 00:09.017
that tries to identify
potential candidates

00:09.051 --> 00:10.885
for political office
here in town.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.288
Are you theoretically interested
in running for office?

00:13.322 --> 00:14.856
Abso-toot-ly I am.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.791
Very sorry that I just used
that word.

00:16.826 --> 00:19.227
Before we go any further,
I need you to tell me

00:19.261 --> 00:20.628
is there a scandal out there?

00:20.646 --> 00:25.200
Is there anything at all you
need to tell us about your life?

00:25.234 --> 00:27.302
Nope.

00:31.023 --> 00:32.473
Who were the suits?

00:32.491 --> 00:35.276
They want me to run for office.

00:35.311 --> 00:37.829
Oh, my God!
Leslie, yea!

00:37.863 --> 00:39.214
I know, right?
Yea.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.415
- Yea!
- Yea!

00:40.449 --> 00:41.649
- Yea!
- Yea!

00:41.684 --> 00:43.051
Wait, what does that mean
about you and Ben?

00:43.085 --> 00:44.119
I don't know.

00:44.153 --> 00:45.420
I think
it's gonna be really bad.

00:45.454 --> 00:47.155
Uh-oh. You just wanna go back
to saying "yea"?

00:47.189 --> 00:48.323
Yes, please.

00:48.357 --> 00:51.926
- Okay, yea.
- Yea. Yea.

00:51.961 --> 00:53.545
- Knope, follow me.
- Just one second.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.130
- Now!
- Ron, hey!

00:55.164 --> 00:57.265
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron!

00:57.299 --> 00:58.433
What's going on?

00:58.467 --> 01:00.034
My ex-wife Tammy is back.

01:00.069 --> 01:01.436
Yeah, I saw her
in the courtyard.

01:01.470 --> 01:04.172
No, my other ex-wife Tammy.
Tammy one.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.474
I have accrued 228
personal days.

01:06.508 --> 01:08.226
Starting right now,
I'm using all of them.

01:10.346 --> 01:13.848
While I'm gone,
you're in charge.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.235
Ah!

01:17.286 --> 01:20.905
Also, I keep a sizable supply
of ground chuck in my desk.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.625
Remove it or it will begin
to smell.

01:23.659 --> 01:25.293
Godspeed.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.696
- Hi, Ron.
- Move!

01:28.714 --> 01:31.166
Whoa!

01:31.200 --> 01:32.734
Ah, geez.

Warning! High levels
of swagger coming through.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.359
Tommy Haverford back
in the Parks Department.

01:58.394 --> 02:01.010
Entertainment720 hockey jersey,
anybody?

02:02.097 --> 02:03.581
Branded mouse pad?

02:03.616 --> 02:06.567
Entertainment720 is just
a little multi-national

02:06.585 --> 02:08.786
entertainment company
that I started with my boy

02:08.838 --> 02:10.104
Jean-Ralphio.

02:10.139 --> 02:11.806
What exactly do we do?

02:11.841 --> 02:14.475
Let's just say it's too hard
to explain.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.778
Donna, you look amazing.
How are the kids?

02:16.812 --> 02:18.346
- I don't have kids.
- Wow.

02:18.380 --> 02:20.348
- How long has it been?
- Three weeks.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.934
So did you get a chance to look

02:22.968 --> 02:24.269
at my sample position papers?

02:24.303 --> 02:26.938
How do you feel about my stance
on Egyptian debt relief?

02:26.972 --> 02:28.806
Uh, well, it probably won't
come up

02:28.858 --> 02:31.442
in a local City Council
election.

02:31.477 --> 02:34.195
But your thoroughness,
as always, is impressive.

02:34.230 --> 02:35.480
Thank you.

02:35.531 --> 02:38.366
Now, we have three months.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.601
I think we should start
talking strategy.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.787
My strategy is to win.

02:42.821 --> 02:45.990
I've been dreaming about running
for public office my whole life.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.409
While other girls were playing
with Barbies,

02:48.443 --> 02:51.746
I was playing with a
Geraldine Ferraro action figure

02:51.780 --> 02:54.148
that I made myself from
a picture of her that I glued

02:54.183 --> 02:55.884
onto a popsicle stick.

02:55.918 --> 02:57.185
See you next week?

02:57.219 --> 02:58.219
Okay, I'm looking forward
to it.

02:58.254 --> 02:59.337
Hey! What--

02:59.388 --> 03:02.507
- Who was that?
- Uh...

03:02.558 --> 03:04.592
Lady--just ladies.

03:04.626 --> 03:06.895
Meeting for the ladies'
yacht club.

03:06.929 --> 03:08.429
- Anchors away, ladies.
- What?

03:08.463 --> 03:09.964
Just don't--

03:09.982 --> 03:11.532
Ladies' yacht club?

03:11.567 --> 03:13.518
I cannot believe you haven't
told him yet.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.470
After I tell him,
I'm running for office,

03:15.504 --> 03:16.854
we're gonna have to break up.

03:16.906 --> 03:19.157
Why can't you just keep
sneaking around?

03:19.191 --> 03:23.311
Ann, you beautiful, naive,
sophisticated, newborn baby.

03:23.329 --> 03:24.812
What?

03:24.847 --> 03:27.482
Before, if people found out,
we would maybe lose our jobs.

03:27.516 --> 03:30.585
Now, if people find out,
it's gonna be a major scandal.

03:30.619 --> 03:33.154
My campaign will be over
before it begins.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.956
- What are you gonna do?
- I have a plan.

03:34.990 --> 03:36.457
And it's really good.

03:36.492 --> 03:38.693
I'm gonna postpone telling him

03:38.727 --> 03:41.662
until you figure out
what I'm supposed to do.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.997
So get crackin'.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.349
How is this on me?

03:44.383 --> 03:47.518
Fine! I'll do it.
God, who keeps emailing me?

03:47.553 --> 03:50.188
- A penis.
- What?

03:50.222 --> 03:52.307
Oh, my God.

03:52.341 --> 03:54.075
Oh--

03:54.109 --> 03:55.410
It's emailing me too.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.079
Whoever this is sent it
to every woman

03:58.113 --> 04:00.698
in the entire government.

04:00.733 --> 04:03.017
Oh, my God.

04:03.052 --> 04:06.955
He's gonna be so embarrassed.
I mean, that's a crazy accident.

04:06.989 --> 04:10.725
No, Andy, he did it on purpose.

04:10.759 --> 04:12.894
You know what? Respect.
That's a baller move.

04:12.928 --> 04:14.062
Pun intended.

04:14.096 --> 04:15.413
Excuse me.

04:15.464 --> 04:16.630
Chris, Jerry's making us look
at dirty pictures

04:16.665 --> 04:17.749
on his computer.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.584
It is exactly because of
that lewd photo

04:19.635 --> 04:20.902
that I am here.

04:20.935 --> 04:22.587
Ben and I are launching a full
investigation.

04:22.638 --> 04:25.539
And I want to apologize
to all the women...

04:25.557 --> 04:26.941
And Jerry.

04:26.976 --> 04:30.044
If I could go back in time,
and cut your eyeballs out,

04:30.079 --> 04:31.045
I would.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.648
- Wow, that is so sweet.
- Thank you.

04:33.682 --> 04:36.484
We are getting a lot of media
requests about this.

04:36.518 --> 04:38.453
So Leslie, can you do
Perd Hapley?

04:38.487 --> 04:40.938
Ho! She can do Perd Hapley.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.857
Hi-oh!

04:42.891 --> 04:44.826
Seriously,
can you do his TV show?

04:44.860 --> 04:47.245
Oh, yeah.

04:47.279 --> 04:49.447
Andrew my man-drew,
what are you up to?

04:49.498 --> 04:52.066
I'm about to do an experiment
where I huck this at the wall

04:52.101 --> 04:54.252
and see what happens.

04:54.286 --> 04:55.903
But that can wait.
Shoe shine?

04:55.921 --> 04:57.255
Andy, I'm gonna be honest.

04:57.289 --> 04:59.240
I came here today
to talk to you.

04:59.258 --> 05:02.410
Now look, you're enthusiastic.
You're hard-working.

05:02.444 --> 05:03.845
You can lift heavy things.

05:03.879 --> 05:04.946
I think there might be a place
for you

05:04.980 --> 05:06.931
over at Entertainment720.

05:06.965 --> 05:08.850
Oh, my God.

05:08.884 --> 05:09.884
What is that?

05:09.918 --> 05:11.269
It's my company!

05:11.303 --> 05:12.753
I don't know, Tom.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.123
I mean, I'm just now getting
really good at shoe shining.

05:15.157 --> 05:17.125
And I mean, I'm still
pretty bad at it.

05:17.159 --> 05:21.829
Let me ask you this.
Are you living your dreams?

05:21.864 --> 05:24.432
- I don't know, Tom.
- Well, I'm living mine.

05:24.466 --> 05:28.986
And if you wanna live yours,
here's my card.

05:29.038 --> 05:32.440
- It's impossible to read.
- Black print, black background.

05:32.458 --> 05:33.991
It's the coolest possible
color scheme.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.960
- Yeah.
- It's also a strong magnet.

05:35.994 --> 05:38.379
So don't put it in your wallet.
It will erase your credit cards,

05:38.414 --> 05:40.465
guaranteed.

05:40.499 --> 05:44.218
Destroy my credit cards.
Debt and everything?

05:44.253 --> 05:47.922
Mr. Mayor, I promise you
that we will find the owner

05:47.956 --> 05:49.190
of that weiner

05:49.224 --> 05:51.726
and we will punish him.
Good-bye.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.127
- Ann Perkins!
- Hey.

05:53.162 --> 05:55.063
I didn't know who to come to
with this,

05:55.097 --> 05:58.683
but that picture, uh--there's
something very disturbing

05:58.734 --> 06:00.301
about the testicles.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.203
I've always felt
the same way myself.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.906
The testicles are like
the ears of the genital system.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.474
They serve a very
important function,

06:06.492 --> 06:08.409
but they're not that great
to look at.

06:08.444 --> 06:12.680
Okay, wow.
No, I was speaking medically.

06:12.714 --> 06:14.015
They're enlarged.

06:14.049 --> 06:16.534
I think that maybe that guy
is sick with something--

06:16.585 --> 06:19.153
perhaps, a hernia, or mumps.

06:19.188 --> 06:22.090
Ann Perkins!
You really know your testes.

06:22.124 --> 06:24.759
Thank you?

06:24.793 --> 06:27.011
For a female perspective
on this scandal,

06:27.045 --> 06:29.663
we turn to a woman,
Leslie Knope.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.215
I'm about to ask you a question
right now

06:31.266 --> 06:32.600
and that question is this.

06:32.634 --> 06:35.219
The lewd photo--
just how big a deal is it?

06:35.270 --> 06:37.772
Well, frankly, Perd,
it's not <i>that</i> big a deal.

06:37.806 --> 06:39.307
If you know what I mean.

06:39.341 --> 06:41.859
I don't know what you mean.

06:41.894 --> 06:44.278
But it had the cadence
of a joke.

06:44.313 --> 06:46.714
When men in government
behave this way,

06:46.748 --> 06:49.117
they betray the public's trust.

06:49.151 --> 06:51.536
Maybe it's time for more women
to be in charge.

06:51.570 --> 06:54.188
There you have it,
where "it" is the thing

06:54.223 --> 06:56.858
Leslie Knope just said
about this situation.

06:56.892 --> 06:58.092
Perd Hap--

06:58.127 --> 06:59.260
How was that?
Was that okay?

06:59.294 --> 07:01.829
Amazing.
That sound bite is gold.

07:01.864 --> 07:03.714
You're gonna get great
feedback on this,

07:03.749 --> 07:05.917
and we think we can capitalize.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.369
You're gonna announce
your candidacy on Friday.

07:08.403 --> 07:11.939
Friday.
In three months.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.742
No, this Friday.
Is that okay?

07:14.776 --> 07:16.677
No, yeah.
Yes, it is great.

07:16.711 --> 07:19.597
Okay, we'll do that then
now soon.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.933
And, um, I just have something
I've been postponing for a while

07:21.984 --> 07:23.885
that I need to do,
but I'll do it now.

07:23.919 --> 07:25.853
- Great.
- Great.

07:25.888 --> 07:27.388
Yea.

07:28.621 --> 07:29.485
I know it.

07:30.113 --> 07:31.642
- Ben?
- Uh, okay.

07:31.762 --> 07:33.499
Ben? I need to talk to you.

07:34.869 --> 07:37.051
That was my brother.
He just had a baby girl.

07:37.171 --> 07:39.805
Oh, my God, that's horrible.
Or good--full disclosure.

07:39.925 --> 07:41.225
I didn't listen to what
you just said.

07:41.259 --> 07:42.510
I need to talk to you
about something--

07:41.971 --> 07:43.304
Okay, well, before you
say anything,

07:43.339 --> 07:46.348
let me just show you
what I got at Doug's Donuts.

07:46.468 --> 07:49.255
It's an L-shaped eclair!

07:49.524 --> 07:52.514
The "L" is for Leslie...
For your name.

07:57.319 --> 07:59.220
Hey.

07:59.238 --> 08:01.439
- How are you?
- Bad, really bad.

08:01.645 --> 08:03.913
Oh, God.
How did the breakup go?

08:03.948 --> 08:07.116
Well, I started crying
because he gave me an eclair.

08:07.151 --> 08:08.985
And then we made out
and spent the night together.

08:09.019 --> 08:11.854
But this morning in the cold
light of day,

08:11.889 --> 08:14.223
I cooked breakfast
and we made out some more.

08:14.258 --> 08:16.326
Wow, you opposite-of-broke-up
with him.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.463
He gave me an eclair, Ann!

08:20.497 --> 08:23.566
Joe, I've determined that
the lewd picture was sent by you

08:23.600 --> 08:27.937
because you sent it from your
personal email address,

08:27.972 --> 08:33.809
stinkmaster69@alumni.sarahlawrencecollege.edu.

08:33.844 --> 08:35.544
Really?
Sarah Lawrence?

08:35.578 --> 08:37.813
Yeah. I wanted a small
college experience.

08:37.847 --> 08:40.767
You also bragged about it
to many of your co-workers.

08:40.801 --> 08:43.519
There's an old sewage
department saying.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.655
"If you've got a nice
drainpipe,

08:45.689 --> 08:47.290
there's no reason to hide it."

08:47.324 --> 08:48.491
I doubt that's a saying.

08:48.525 --> 08:50.926
We are terminating you
effective immediately.

08:50.944 --> 08:52.395
Is this because you're jealous?

08:52.429 --> 08:54.931
No.
It's because you broke the law.

08:54.965 --> 08:56.933
The law of having
an amazing package.

08:56.967 --> 08:58.434
Before we have him
forcibly removed,

08:58.452 --> 09:00.787
you should know this, that
one of our female employees,

09:00.821 --> 09:02.705
a nurse, examined the photo
you sent her--

09:02.740 --> 09:04.374
I bet she did.

09:04.408 --> 09:05.875
And you have the mumps.

09:05.909 --> 09:07.210
You might wanna get
that checked.

09:07.244 --> 09:08.578
Sweet.

09:08.612 --> 09:11.381
Someone's got mumps
on his lumps.

09:11.415 --> 09:13.633
Up high.
Anyone?

09:13.667 --> 09:15.151
Ron isn't here.

09:15.185 --> 09:19.389
His ex-wife Tammy came,
and he got scared and ran away.

09:19.423 --> 09:21.007
Well, as acting manager
of the Parks Department,

09:21.266 --> 09:24.334
I declare that everything
you are saying is stupid.

09:24.352 --> 09:25.903
I love you.

09:25.937 --> 09:28.839
Hey, so Tom offered me a job
again.

09:28.873 --> 09:31.408
As my manager,
what do you think I should do?

09:31.443 --> 09:33.343
Well, what do you wanna do?

09:33.361 --> 09:36.413
I think it'd be kinda cool
to work for Tom.

09:36.448 --> 09:38.282
So take it.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.952
But working at a start-up
can be kind of risky.

09:41.987 --> 09:43.120
So don't take it.

09:43.154 --> 09:44.521
But Tom told me to follow
my dreams.

09:44.556 --> 09:45.923
So take it.

09:45.957 --> 09:49.293
- But this isn't my dream.
- So don't take it.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.629
- I don't know what to do.
- Me neither.

09:51.663 --> 09:53.747
You give such good advice.

09:53.798 --> 09:55.749
Babe, I love you.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.035
You're welcome.

10:00.939 --> 10:02.372
Ann Perkins!

10:02.390 --> 10:04.425
Hey. Did you maybe tell people

10:04.476 --> 10:07.544
that I diagnosed that guy with
mumps based on his porn photo?

10:07.579 --> 10:09.079
I did!
I was so proud of you.

10:09.114 --> 10:11.482
Okay, because now I have
everyone in City Hall

10:11.516 --> 10:13.017
sending me pictures
of their junk,

10:13.051 --> 10:14.918
asking me if they have mumps.

10:14.953 --> 10:16.987
Oh, my God.

10:17.022 --> 10:19.723
Your inbox is literally filled
with penises.

10:19.758 --> 10:21.108
- Mm-hmm.
- I am so sorry.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.663
Oh, look.
Ed Miller from payroll.

10:25.697 --> 10:28.115
Before I do this,
is there any possible way that

10:28.166 --> 10:29.466
we could still keep dating?

10:29.501 --> 10:32.002
We've attacked this
from all angles.

10:32.037 --> 10:33.771
Either you don't run
for office--

10:33.805 --> 10:35.272
Which is out of the question.

10:35.307 --> 10:37.408
Or you break up with him
and avoid a potential scandal.

10:38.810 --> 10:40.427
- Do you need to get that?
- No, it's just penises.

10:40.462 --> 10:42.629
Leslie, I don't want you
to break up with him either.

10:42.681 --> 10:44.815
- There's just no other way.
- Yeah.

10:44.849 --> 10:46.750
Just be direct and honest.

10:46.768 --> 10:48.052
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:48.086 --> 10:49.453
Hmm.

10:49.487 --> 10:51.939
It's the entire Sanitation
Department for Muncie.

10:51.973 --> 10:52.990
Ooh.

10:54.659 --> 10:56.126
Would you like any wine
to start?

10:56.161 --> 10:59.029
Yes, and I'm gonna be direct
and honest with you.

10:59.064 --> 11:00.497
I would like a glass of red wine

11:00.532 --> 11:01.699
and I'll take
the cheapest one you have

11:01.733 --> 11:02.866
because I can't tell
the difference.

11:02.901 --> 11:04.818
- I'll have the same.
- Great.

11:04.869 --> 11:08.005
- Okay. Here's the deal.
- Okay.

11:08.039 --> 11:10.941
- I really, really like you.
- I like you too.

11:10.975 --> 11:12.743
And I think I know
what you're gonna say.

11:12.777 --> 11:15.946
- I highly doubt that.
- I think I do.

11:15.980 --> 11:18.215
- Oh, I don't.
- And, um...

11:18.249 --> 11:21.502
- I got you something.
- No. What is this?

11:21.553 --> 11:23.187
- Is this jewelry?
- It's not, just open it.

11:23.221 --> 11:26.289
No.
Oh, I need to go to...

11:26.307 --> 11:27.591
Another place.

11:27.625 --> 11:30.010
I'm gonna go to the bathroom--
the Whiz Palace,

11:30.061 --> 11:31.345
as we like to call it here--

11:31.396 --> 11:34.565
and I'm going to be back
and I'm not gonna split.

11:34.599 --> 11:37.425
I'm here for you because
we need to talk about stuff.

11:37.545 --> 11:40.303
- Okay?
- All right.

11:40.321 --> 11:42.072
Wait--

11:48.413 --> 11:51.406
- Ron.
- What are you doing here?

11:51.526 --> 11:53.869
Running away from my problems.

11:53.989 --> 11:55.772
Come on in.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.408
- Ok, so here's what's going on.
- I didn't ask.

12:04.528 --> 12:05.885
Friday, I'm supposed
to announce that I'm running

12:06.125 --> 12:07.659
for City Council,
and I haven't told Ben yet.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.694
I know I said that we broke up,
but we couldn't.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.356
We're still dating.

12:11.391 --> 12:12.590
But now I have to break up
with him for real,

12:12.624 --> 12:13.808
but I don't wanna break up
with him

12:13.859 --> 12:15.226
because he's so cute.
He's so nice.

12:15.260 --> 12:16.694
If you're gonna stay here,
there are three rules

12:16.728 --> 12:18.529
you need to follow.

12:18.563 --> 12:22.299
One, no talk about Tammy one.
Two, no talk about Ben.

12:22.334 --> 12:24.135
Three, no talk.

12:24.169 --> 12:25.536
I didn't even ask you
last night.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.937
What is going on
with Tammy one?

12:26.972 --> 12:29.373
You just violated rules
number one and three.

12:29.407 --> 12:30.941
You lose your coffee
privileges.

12:30.976 --> 12:32.960
Oh.

12:32.994 --> 12:37.948
Oh, you choose, Knope--
hunting, fishing, or drinking?

12:37.983 --> 12:40.317
I'd really love to shoot
a gun right now.

12:40.352 --> 12:41.719
Fishing it is.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.806
And so effective immediately,
all male employees

12:45.841 --> 12:49.176
must stop sending explicit
photos to Ms. Perkins.

12:49.227 --> 12:52.146
If I may, what if based
on empirical evidence,

12:52.180 --> 12:56.200
I truly believe there's a grave
and immediate medical emergency?

12:56.234 --> 13:00.304
Were that the case,
could I then show you my dong?

13:00.338 --> 13:01.605
No.

13:01.639 --> 13:04.041
- That would be harassment.
- Fair enough.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.976
Now completely different
scenario.

13:06.011 --> 13:08.646
Let's say I've been watching
a lot of women's golf

13:08.680 --> 13:10.555
and I've had some wine--

13:10.675 --> 13:11.749
How about this?

13:11.783 --> 13:14.967
I'm gonna get a male doctor to
come in and do some screenings.

13:15.087 --> 13:15.753
Perfect.

13:15.787 --> 13:17.881
Just as a backup,
I'm sending you some photos.

13:18.001 --> 13:19.715
- That will not be necessary.
- That's me.

13:21.485 --> 13:23.587
Brand-new day,
brand-new merch.

13:23.621 --> 13:26.690
I got you guys some awesome
Entertainment720 stuff.

13:26.724 --> 13:30.893
Donna, this is for you.
Entertainment720 umbrella.

13:30.912 --> 13:34.864
Entertainment720 fly swatters.
Rubik's cube with my face on it.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.116
â™ª Breath mints â™ª

13:36.167 --> 13:37.667
Fireplace bellows.

13:37.702 --> 13:39.302
And... drum roll please.

13:40.538 --> 13:42.439
Drum roll sound effect
key chain.

13:42.473 --> 13:45.342
Shouldn't you be working
at your new company, Tom?

13:45.376 --> 13:46.626
I am working, April.

13:46.677 --> 13:49.045
I'm making high-level
network contacts.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.097
You think Bethenny Frankel
sits behind a desk all day?

13:51.132 --> 13:54.251
She makes $100 million a year.
How much you make a year?

13:54.285 --> 13:55.452
$101 million.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.320
Well, I, for one,
am happy to see Tom.

13:57.355 --> 13:58.555
Thanks, Jerry!

13:58.589 --> 14:01.107
Here. Have an umbrella
and some breath strips.

14:01.142 --> 14:02.692
Whoa.

14:02.727 --> 14:04.027
All right, enough chitchat,
everyone.

14:04.061 --> 14:06.763
- Please get back to work.
- You're not our boss.

14:06.781 --> 14:08.932
- What'd you just say to me?
- Ma'am.

14:08.966 --> 14:12.602
So... did you get a chance
to think about my offer?

14:12.620 --> 14:14.771
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

14:14.805 --> 14:17.307
I wanna do my dreams,
but I just don't think my dream

14:17.341 --> 14:19.609
is working for a company that
puts logos on stuff.

14:19.644 --> 14:21.344
That's not my company does.

14:21.379 --> 14:23.213
Although, maybe we'll start.

14:23.247 --> 14:25.849
Hey, what you think?

14:25.883 --> 14:27.167
Donna... that looks great.

14:27.218 --> 14:29.352
I could do without this one.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.289
So running for office.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.759
Now I'm gonna have to find
a replacement for you.

14:35.793 --> 14:38.495
- I might not win.
- You'll win.

14:38.529 --> 14:42.899
- I might not run.
- You should.

14:42.933 --> 14:44.818
What's our plan here, Knope?

14:44.852 --> 14:48.505
I figure we build a fire,
roast the fish we shot,

14:48.539 --> 14:50.206
and make s'mores.

14:50.241 --> 14:52.008
I don't have the material
for s'mores.

14:52.043 --> 14:53.443
I do.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.478
I always carry emergency
s'more rations in my car.

14:55.513 --> 14:58.031
Given your hunting abilities

14:58.082 --> 15:00.033
and my chocolate supply,

15:00.084 --> 15:04.337
I figure we could stay up here
for two... three years.

15:10.127 --> 15:11.661
You know, when I was 12,

15:11.696 --> 15:14.831
my brother shot me in
the pinky toe with a nail gun.

15:14.865 --> 15:17.500
Granted, it was
a hilarious prank,

15:17.535 --> 15:19.001
and we all had a good laugh.

15:19.020 --> 15:20.169
That's awful.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.004
But I avoided going
to the doctor.

15:22.023 --> 15:24.140
I hate paperwork.

15:24.175 --> 15:27.110
After a few weeks,
the toe just kinda fell off.

15:27.144 --> 15:28.611
You only have nine toes?

15:28.646 --> 15:31.314
I have the toes I have.

15:31.349 --> 15:32.916
Let's just leave it at that.

15:32.950 --> 15:36.453
The point is the doctor said
if I had come in right away,

15:36.487 --> 15:39.055
they might've saved the toe.

15:39.090 --> 15:41.358
You can't run away
from your problems.

15:41.392 --> 15:43.593
Especially if you only have
nine toes.

15:44.912 --> 15:48.965
Sorry.
That was uncalled for.

15:48.999 --> 15:52.469
I'm Ron Swanson.
And you're Leslie Knope.

15:55.139 --> 15:57.974
You with me?

16:02.313 --> 16:04.214
Well, what is your dream?

16:04.248 --> 16:06.516
It's to be the biggest rock
star on the planet obviously.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.218
But that could take another
3-5 years.

16:08.252 --> 16:09.486
Don't get me wrong.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.789
Shoe shining has been a...
been a pretty wild ride.

16:12.823 --> 16:16.292
But is it possible there's
something more out there for me?

16:16.327 --> 16:19.129
Andy, there's tons of stuff
you can do.

16:19.163 --> 16:20.914
I'll help you figure it out.

16:20.948 --> 16:22.782
- Really?
- Yes.

16:22.833 --> 16:26.536
One year from now, you,
Andy Dwyer, will no longer be

16:26.570 --> 16:29.973
a shoe shinist.

16:30.007 --> 16:31.574
Kyle, beat it.

16:31.609 --> 16:33.777
I wanna make out
with my wife now.

16:33.811 --> 16:35.645
But you've only done half
of one of my shoes.

16:35.679 --> 16:40.633
Here.
Now I haven't done anything.

16:40.684 --> 16:43.753
Scram, kid.

16:46.023 --> 16:48.057
- Hello.
- Hey, Ron! Welcome--

16:48.091 --> 16:50.927
Stop.
First order of business.

16:50.961 --> 16:53.363
I promised Leslie
I'd hire her a new assistant

16:53.397 --> 16:56.265
so the department doesn't
completely shut down

16:56.283 --> 16:58.618
while she runs for office.

16:58.652 --> 17:01.438
- You're running for office?
- Yeah, City Council.

17:01.472 --> 17:03.440
- Leslie, that is great.
- Thank you.

17:03.474 --> 17:07.644
Will you pledge right now
not to raise taxes?

17:07.678 --> 17:11.781
- I think that's premature.
- No pledge, no vote.

17:11.799 --> 17:13.800
The point is
she needs an assistant.

17:13.834 --> 17:16.486
- Start asking around--
- Hire Andy.

17:16.520 --> 17:20.623
- Andy can do it.
- Sure, yeah.

17:20.657 --> 17:21.790
Done.

17:21.809 --> 17:24.794
Andy, you are now Leslie's
assistant.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.596
Honey.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.265
No--

17:29.300 --> 17:31.568
Leslie, I'm gonna work
my ass off for you.

17:31.602 --> 17:33.870
I'll do anything you ask me.
I will prove myself.

17:33.904 --> 17:35.171
You don't even have to pay me.

17:35.206 --> 17:36.606
No, honey, no.

17:36.640 --> 17:40.160
Tomorrow, there will be
a 300-page orientation booklet

17:40.194 --> 17:42.011
as well as a dozen
homemade cookies

17:42.046 --> 17:43.580
in the shape of your face.

17:43.614 --> 17:46.382
But today...

17:46.417 --> 17:50.553
There's something else
I have to do.

17:50.588 --> 17:55.558
If any of you need
anything at all, too bad.

17:55.593 --> 17:58.127
Deal with your problems
yourselves like adults.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.496
I'll be in my office,
waiting for Tammy one.

18:00.514 --> 18:01.798
You want me to find her?

18:01.832 --> 18:03.800
There's no need.
She'll find me.

18:03.834 --> 18:09.272
She has the tracking ability
and body odor of a bloodhound.

18:11.559 --> 18:13.943
Okay, so now you're sure that
everything is okay, you know,

18:13.978 --> 18:15.144
down there?

18:15.178 --> 18:17.981
You're perfectly healthy.

18:18.015 --> 18:21.618
That man has the largest penis
I have ever seen.

18:21.652 --> 18:23.286
I actually don't even know
if he has mumps.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.654
Forgot to look.

18:24.688 --> 18:30.243
I was distracted by the largest
penis I have ever seen.

18:33.297 --> 18:34.998
I know I've been acting
really weird lately,

18:35.032 --> 18:37.901
and, um, I really like you.

18:37.935 --> 18:39.636
What I'm about to say
is gonna contradict the idea

18:39.670 --> 18:41.237
that I really like you,
but that won't change--

18:41.272 --> 18:42.372
So just open the box.

18:42.406 --> 18:44.107
Please stop bringing out
the box, okay?

18:44.141 --> 18:45.542
- Leslie--
- You're being really nice,

18:45.576 --> 18:47.644
and what I'm about to say
is gonna make you hate me.

18:47.678 --> 18:49.812
Okay, then I'll just open
the box for you.

18:53.183 --> 18:55.752
Wow.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.554
You knew?

18:57.588 --> 18:59.606
I figured it out a while ago.

18:59.657 --> 19:01.858
I'm sorry.
I should've told you I knew.

19:01.892 --> 19:06.229
But I just--I wanted this
to last as long as possible.

19:06.263 --> 19:08.031
We have to break up.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.701
Why?
Why do we have to break up?

19:11.735 --> 19:15.038
Well, Leslie, everything
you've accomplished,

19:15.072 --> 19:17.040
you have earned
and you have worked for.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.742
I don't want anyone to think
that you got where you are today

19:19.777 --> 19:23.546
by sleeping with your boss.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.881
But I really like sleeping
with my boss.

19:24.915 --> 19:27.183
Yeah... Yeah.

19:27.217 --> 19:29.519
Okay, look. I'm gonna make this
real easy for you.

19:29.553 --> 19:34.824
Um, it's not you, it's me.
I'm not ready for a commitment.

19:34.858 --> 19:36.793
I just don't like you anymore.

19:36.827 --> 19:39.562
I know it's hard to hear that,
but...

19:39.597 --> 19:41.731
You're boring, and frankly
you disgust me.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.449
Echh!

19:45.869 --> 19:47.604
How did you figure it out?

19:47.638 --> 19:50.640
Leslie, there was a dude
in the ladies' yacht club.

19:50.674 --> 19:52.642
Yeah, but I covered that
pretty well.

19:52.676 --> 19:56.296
Also, you've been making
campaign speeches in your sleep.

19:56.330 --> 20:00.183
Granted, you always do that,
but they got really specific

20:00.217 --> 20:02.018
and moving.

20:02.052 --> 20:03.586
Did I have a good opening line?

20:03.621 --> 20:07.924
It was simple, but I liked it.

20:07.958 --> 20:11.728
Friends, honored guests,
Pawneeans.

20:11.762 --> 20:15.815
I am Leslie Knope, and
I am running for City Council.

20:29.462 --> 20:33.065
- Hello, Tammy.
- Ronald.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.534
That's enough small talk.
What do you want?

20:35.568 --> 20:38.158
You remember what I do
for a living, I trust?

20:38.508 --> 20:41.240
Yes.
You ruin people's lives.

20:43.322 --> 20:46.211
You're being audited, Ronald.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.346
I don't care.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.834
Then why is your mustache
trembling?

20:50.103 --> 20:52.117
I'm here as a friend.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.519
Call it nostalgia.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.288
Or perhaps guilt
for all the times

20:56.322 --> 20:58.290
I tried to smother you
in your sleep.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.544
- I don't need your help.
- Wrong. You do.

21:01.778 --> 21:04.451
But as you're so fond of saying,
it's a free country.

21:04.707 --> 21:05.976
Good luck.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.667
I hope you don't go to jail.

21:11.226 --> 21:14.040
Sit up straight.
You're not doing your breasts any favors.

21:15.430 --> 21:17.282
Thank you.

21:18.351 --> 21:21.522
Hi. Your breasts look amazing.
