right, Niklaus.

desiccating in a coffin,
that my big brother

So I explained
to my little brother

that forgiveness
cannot be bought.

01:22.859 --> 01:24.276
I'd simply prefer to see
a change in behavior

12:03.666 --> 12:08.003
and our power means nothing
if that baby grows another day.

12:08.004 --> 12:11.039
Sabine's omen
was clear.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.209
That baby will bring
death to us all.

12:14.210 --> 12:17.128
What are you
gonna do?

12:18.213 --> 12:22.384
Oh, God, no. No.
Agnes, no. No.

12:22.385 --> 12:24.485
No! Don't you... aah!

12:28.772 --> 12:31.607
Ah!

12:31.609 --> 12:33.409
Rebekah: What
the hell was that?

12:33.411 --> 12:34.862
Hell if I know.

12:34.863 --> 12:36.863
It felt like
I was being stabbed.

12:39.816 --> 12:41.984
What happened?

12:43.370 --> 12:46.957
It was Agnes.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.293
Her men
took Sophie.

12:49.294 --> 12:51.712
Klaus: Day one with you
in charge, brother,

12:51.713 --> 12:53.514
and already the witch link
to Hayley

12:53.515 --> 12:55.999
has been abducted
by zealots.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.384
Where is she?

12:57.385 --> 12:58.502
If I tell you
where Agnes is,

12:58.503 --> 12:59.636
you'll just kill her.

12:59.637 --> 13:01.004
Is it that
obvious?

13:01.005 --> 13:03.173
Look. I know she's
a little cuckoo,

13:03.174 --> 13:05.726
but she's our last
living elder.

13:05.727 --> 13:07.010
That might not mean
a lot to you,

13:07.011 --> 13:08.177
but it means
plenty to us.

13:08.179 --> 13:09.196
The elders are
the only ones

13:09.197 --> 13:11.098
who can do
important spells.

13:11.099 --> 13:13.534
Like completing
the harvest ritual.

13:13.535 --> 13:15.401
You know
about that?

13:15.403 --> 13:18.372
Oh, you'd be astounded
by the things I know.

13:18.373 --> 13:20.407
Allow me to
entertain you

13:20.408 --> 13:22.459
with today's list
of priorities.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.694
One, unlink
your friend Sophie

13:24.695 --> 13:26.413
so she no longer
controls the fate

13:26.414 --> 13:28.082
of the woman
carrying my child.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.033
Two, convince
my brother to accept

13:30.034 --> 13:31.418
my heartfelt
apologies

13:31.419 --> 13:33.637
for some recently
dodgy behavior.

13:33.638 --> 13:36.473
3, there is no 3.

13:36.474 --> 13:38.725
I believe what my brother is
attempting to communicate here

13:38.726 --> 13:40.761
is that neither the life
of this elder

13:40.762 --> 13:42.479
nor the harvest ritual
nor your coven's

13:42.480 --> 13:43.897
connection to magic
are of any relevance

13:43.898 --> 13:47.016
to him whatsoever.

13:50.154 --> 13:52.488
Now talk.

13:52.490 --> 13:55.826
[Creak]

13:55.827 --> 13:57.743
[Groaning]

14:01.415 --> 14:03.784
Thierry.

14:03.785 --> 14:06.503
Marcel.

14:06.504 --> 14:09.006
Come to punish
me again?

14:09.007 --> 14:10.440
Someone asked
if there's anyone

14:10.441 --> 14:11.792
I ever trusted.

14:11.793 --> 14:13.876
I only came up
with one name...

14:17.798 --> 14:19.600
You.

14:19.601 --> 14:20.851
So, Thierry,
you and I

14:20.852 --> 14:23.686
are gonna have
a little talk...

14:26.056 --> 14:28.724
About Klaus Mikaelson.

14:30.561 --> 14:33.312
Rebekah: It's time for
the demon spawn to snack.

14:33.314 --> 14:35.364
I really wish you
wouldn't call her that.

14:35.366 --> 14:37.451
I'm sorry. Have you
picked another name yet?

14:37.452 --> 14:41.103
Take one. The plantation
is lousy with them.

14:41.105 --> 14:42.789
How's your neck?

14:42.790 --> 14:46.160
I feel fine,
which is weird.

14:46.161 --> 14:48.495
I'm sure this
is Sophie-related.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.464
Well, do me a favor and
don't die on my watch.

14:50.465 --> 14:51.781
I'll never hear
the end of it.

14:51.782 --> 14:53.050
You know, when I
first met you,

14:53.051 --> 14:55.284
I thought you
were a real bitch.

14:55.286 --> 14:56.587
What changed
your mind?

14:56.588 --> 14:58.388
Oh, I still think
you're a bitch.

14:58.389 --> 15:00.473
I've just grown
to like that about you.

15:00.475 --> 15:02.125
Ha ha!

15:02.126 --> 15:04.178
Well, that's sweet
of you to say.

15:04.179 --> 15:05.679
Remember it
when I'm gone.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.815
Gone? Where
are you going?

15:08.816 --> 15:10.067
I only came to town
to make sure

15:10.068 --> 15:12.468
everything was ok
with Elijah.

15:12.470 --> 15:14.638
He's fine, and he
hasn't punished Klaus

15:14.639 --> 15:17.074
for daggering him,
so, as usual,

15:17.075 --> 15:18.375
they'll be thick
as thieves,

15:18.376 --> 15:20.810
and I'll be left to
clean up the mess.

15:20.811 --> 15:24.615
It's time for me
to fly the coop.

15:24.616 --> 15:27.617
Oh.

15:31.088 --> 15:34.124
What's wrong?

15:34.125 --> 15:35.925
I don't know.

15:35.927 --> 15:38.212
Probably
morning sickness.

15:38.213 --> 15:39.929
Oh, you're burning
up, actually.

15:41.665 --> 15:45.168
Ah! Agnes stuck me
with a needle.

15:45.169 --> 15:49.723
Ugh! Cursed objects were
created a long time ago.

15:49.724 --> 15:51.341
We use them so we
don't get busted

15:51.342 --> 15:53.176
by Marcel
for doing magic.

15:53.177 --> 15:55.662
The one she used is called
the needle of sorrows.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.264
It was cursed
in 1860, when...

15:57.265 --> 15:58.498
Jump ahead
a few decades

15:58.499 --> 15:59.983
and tell us
what it does, luv.

15:59.984 --> 16:01.617
It has one purpose...

16:01.619 --> 16:05.488
To kill a child in utero by
raising her blood temperature.

16:07.124 --> 16:09.910
It's for
a miscarriage.

16:09.911 --> 16:12.462
So how much time do
we have to fix this?

16:12.463 --> 16:15.332
It'll do what it's meant to
by tonight's high tide,

16:15.333 --> 16:17.417
and... believe me...
It will work.

16:17.418 --> 16:19.869
I saw her use a similar object
on a kid who went mad

16:19.870 --> 16:21.921
and killed a bunch
of priests.

16:21.923 --> 16:25.875
I'd like to have a little
chat with this Agnes.

16:25.876 --> 16:27.877
Where can I
find her?

16:27.878 --> 16:29.546
You won't.

16:29.547 --> 16:31.881
There are a thousand places she
could hole up to wait it out.

16:31.882 --> 16:32.983
That's precisely why
we need to unlink you

16:32.984 --> 16:35.385
from Hayley,
no more danger

16:35.386 --> 16:37.354
towards her
or the child.

16:37.355 --> 16:39.573
No. What?

16:39.574 --> 16:41.391
If I am not linked
to Hayley,

16:41.392 --> 16:43.360
I lose my
leverage on you.

16:43.361 --> 16:44.962
We got a deal.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.148
We are not on the same side,
Sophie Deveraux.

16:48.149 --> 16:50.283
Our deal
no longer stands.

16:54.121 --> 16:56.873
Does this mean
you're pardoning me?

16:56.874 --> 16:58.825
Aw, you know
I can't do that.

16:58.826 --> 17:00.744
You broke my
number-one rule.

17:00.745 --> 17:02.129
You killed
a vampire, T.

17:02.130 --> 17:04.964
I let that go, it'll
make me look weak.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.051
I warned you
about Klaus.

17:09.053 --> 17:11.188
Yeah. I should've
listened.

17:11.189 --> 17:13.272
This guy has been
in my town for months

17:13.273 --> 17:16.026
but hiding where
he lays his head at night.

17:16.027 --> 17:18.361
What else is he hiding
is what I want to know.

17:18.363 --> 17:20.763
I didn't listen
to you before,

17:20.765 --> 17:22.231
but I sure as hell
am now.

17:26.619 --> 17:29.990
Tell me about the night
that got you put in here,

17:29.991 --> 17:33.326
and you might find yourself
out by Mardi Gras.

17:35.796 --> 17:38.665
The night of the
masquerade party,

17:38.666 --> 17:40.250
you sent us rousting
in the cauldron

17:40.251 --> 17:42.552
to mess with
the witches.

17:42.553 --> 17:44.137
So when Max
came in rousting,

17:44.138 --> 17:45.639
he went right
for Katie's throat.

17:45.640 --> 17:49.109
Now, you said to roust.
You didn't say to kill.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.812
Now, he's a nightwalker.
I'm a daywalker.

17:51.813 --> 17:54.765
I told him to stop,
and he wouldn't.

17:54.766 --> 17:57.433
So I stopped him.

17:59.152 --> 18:02.855
That night is on an
endless loop in my head.

18:02.857 --> 18:04.741
I think Max
was compelled.

18:04.742 --> 18:07.277
No. All my guys
are on vervain.

18:07.278 --> 18:10.030
Not if Klaus
drained them.

18:10.031 --> 18:11.665
Max went missing
for a couple of days

18:11.666 --> 18:13.500
before the
rousting, right?

18:13.501 --> 18:14.984
T., they found stuff
you and your girl

18:14.985 --> 18:16.319
stole from me
in her shop.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.705
Have you ever been
to the Jardin Gris?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.040
You can't find
your own hand

18:20.041 --> 18:22.542
in front of
your face in there,

18:22.543 --> 18:24.661
and yet somehow
someone went in there,

18:24.662 --> 18:25.995
and after a couple
of minutes,

18:25.996 --> 18:29.382
they found
some stolen goods?

18:32.502 --> 18:36.223
Go there,
see for yourself,

18:36.224 --> 18:39.893
but I'm telling you,
besides Max,

18:39.894 --> 18:41.728
somebody else
in the crew

18:41.729 --> 18:45.298
had to be compelled.

18:45.299 --> 18:48.901
Watch your back.

18:50.687 --> 18:53.740
So a few tourists
go missing, ok.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.742
We can spin it,
no problem,

18:55.743 --> 18:57.711
but do you know
how rd it is to sell

18:57.712 --> 18:59.713
a gas-leak story to
the city council

18:59.714 --> 19:01.431
when a bunch
of church windows

19:01.432 --> 19:03.048
magically explode?

19:03.050 --> 19:04.367
Come on, Mr. mayor.

19:04.368 --> 19:06.636
What is this,
an electoral debate?

19:06.637 --> 19:09.306
Marcel overstepped.
I will handle it.

19:09.307 --> 19:11.975
Klaus: Easier
said than done.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.643
Marcel is quite
the little warrior.

19:13.644 --> 19:14.928
Uh-uh.

19:14.929 --> 19:16.045
[Crack]
Aah!

19:16.046 --> 19:17.431
Mayor: Who
the hell are you?

19:17.432 --> 19:19.599
My name is Klaus,

19:19.600 --> 19:23.553
and you lot
are the faction...

19:23.554 --> 19:25.489
Pillars of the community
who maintain

19:25.490 --> 19:27.858
the city's
supernatural balance.

19:27.859 --> 19:29.726
I should know.

19:29.727 --> 19:32.395
I created this group,
only in my day,

19:32.396 --> 19:36.166
it was a bunch of pirates
and corrupt politicians.

19:36.167 --> 19:39.168
Looks like
nothing has changed.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.620
One thing has.

19:40.621 --> 19:41.921
It's exclusively
human now...

19:41.923 --> 19:45.124
No vampires allowed,
especially no originals.

19:45.126 --> 19:48.795
I haven't come
to join.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.630
I've come to ask
this group to utilize

19:50.631 --> 19:52.515
its considerable
resources

19:52.517 --> 19:55.936
to find a witch elder
named Agnes.

19:55.937 --> 19:58.321
All I need
is an address.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.689
And why would we
want to help you?

20:00.691 --> 20:02.275
What if I told you
that Agnes

20:02.276 --> 20:03.810
was the answer
to a question

20:03.811 --> 20:05.896
you've been asking since
you ran screaming

20:05.897 --> 20:08.365
from this town,

20:08.366 --> 20:11.785
that she is
the witch who hexed

20:11.786 --> 20:16.705
your nephew Sean?

20:20.710 --> 20:22.329
We'd need some time
to discuss...

20:22.330 --> 20:24.914
I don't have time...

20:25.832 --> 20:29.251
Nor do I like being
asked to wait.

20:31.621 --> 20:34.140
You may have
all the vampires

20:34.141 --> 20:37.143
in this town
cowering in fear,

20:37.144 --> 20:40.063
but right now, you are
dealing with the humans,

20:40.064 --> 20:43.132
and unless you plan
on killing all of us,

20:43.133 --> 20:46.736
I politely suggest
you do as I say

20:46.737 --> 20:50.990
and give us time
to discuss it.

20:52.809 --> 20:55.912
You know, what I like
about you, father,

20:55.913 --> 20:59.032
is, you're aware
of my reputation

20:59.033 --> 21:00.867
and yet still
you stand tall

21:00.868 --> 21:03.653
against me.

21:03.654 --> 21:06.206
It's admirable.

21:06.207 --> 21:08.374
You have one hour.

21:10.710 --> 21:12.879
[Door closes]

21:12.880 --> 21:14.347
Track down that witch...

21:14.348 --> 21:17.350
Cell phone records,
our guys in the 9th.

21:17.351 --> 21:19.769
For the vampire?

21:19.770 --> 21:22.888
No, for me.

21:28.827 --> 21:34.826
Phesmatos, omnio ligor
coldate sangorium.

21:44.376 --> 21:46.495
Rebekah:
Stop fussing, will you?

21:46.496 --> 21:47.746
Elijah will be here
any minute.

21:47.747 --> 21:49.831
I feel like I've
been microwaved.

21:49.832 --> 21:52.334
Hey, just because
you're carrying a baby

21:52.335 --> 21:54.219
doesn't mean you get
to act like one.

21:54.220 --> 21:56.754
I'm sure my little niece
is healing you up as we speak.

22:00.976 --> 22:03.145
Rebekah: What the hell
is she doing here?

22:03.146 --> 22:05.130
I'm trying to help.
Help?

22:05.131 --> 22:06.732
You're the reason we're
in this bloody mess.

22:06.733 --> 22:07.933
Why aren't we unlinked
with this witch

22:07.934 --> 22:09.334
already, Elijah?

22:09.335 --> 22:12.237
Rebekah, let her
do what she can.

22:12.238 --> 22:14.856
I may know a way
to slow the fever down,

22:14.857 --> 22:16.658
but I'm gonna need
some special herbs.

22:16.659 --> 22:18.993
I'll text you
a list.

22:21.830 --> 22:25.416
Fine. Happy to play
the fetch girl.

22:29.504 --> 22:32.673
[Music playing]

22:41.133 --> 22:42.834
[Sighs]

22:42.835 --> 22:44.552
Marcel: Isn't this
Katie's shop?

22:46.239 --> 22:48.473
She leave you the
keys in her will,

22:48.474 --> 22:51.009
or maybe it's just
help yourself Tuesday?

22:51.010 --> 22:53.110
What are you
doing here?

22:53.112 --> 22:55.230
You know, I read that
if you mix mugwort with sage,

22:55.231 --> 22:57.065
you've got quite
the vampire repellant,

22:57.066 --> 22:59.951
wards off even
the most resilient pest.

22:59.952 --> 23:01.370
Why are you here?

23:01.371 --> 23:02.571
Just keeping
my city safe

23:02.572 --> 23:03.905
from thieves
and vandals,

23:03.906 --> 23:05.240
but every time
I turn around,

23:05.241 --> 23:06.625
I catch an original

23:06.626 --> 23:09.077
with their hand
in the cookie jar.

23:09.078 --> 23:12.197
Well, luckily for you,
your cookies

23:12.198 --> 23:14.216
are the last thing
on my mind.

23:14.217 --> 23:17.302
Oh, I can see that,
though I remember

23:17.303 --> 23:20.972
a time when things
were different.

23:20.973 --> 23:25.727
Maybe once.
Not anymore.

23:25.728 --> 23:28.763
Camphor. Find it.

23:30.148 --> 23:32.516
[Door opens and closes]

23:46.615 --> 23:49.700
Klaus: Going somewhere?

23:49.702 --> 23:52.337
You're early.

23:52.338 --> 23:54.406
Well, it's
a good thing I am.

23:54.407 --> 23:56.158
You seem hell-bent
on enacting vengeance

23:56.159 --> 23:59.211
all on your
lonesome.

23:59.212 --> 24:01.830
The trouble is,
I need something

24:01.831 --> 24:03.682
from Agnes before
you send her off

24:03.683 --> 24:06.084
to meet her maker.

24:06.085 --> 24:11.472
So I propose
we strike a deal.

24:12.524 --> 24:14.976
Bring her here.

24:14.977 --> 24:17.362
In exchange,
I'll even ensure

24:17.363 --> 24:22.366
your niece Cami
remains safe.

24:23.702 --> 24:27.205
Mm. I would
so hate for her

24:27.206 --> 24:30.741
to get caught up
in all this.

24:38.358 --> 24:40.811
Agnes: This is outrageous.
What's the charge?

24:40.812 --> 24:42.863
Please, Agnes.

24:42.864 --> 24:45.782
You know that Marcel runs
the vampires in this town.

24:45.783 --> 24:50.202
Who do you think
runs everything else?

24:53.707 --> 24:56.827
I believe this is what
you're looking for.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.894
Hello, Agnes.

24:59.963 --> 25:01.965
You made a deal
with him?

25:01.966 --> 25:04.217
After what you
did to Sean,

25:04.218 --> 25:05.886
I'd deal with
the devil himself

25:05.887 --> 25:07.504
just to see you
suffer.

25:07.505 --> 25:08.621
You can't hurt me.

25:08.622 --> 25:09.622
The entire witch
community

25:09.623 --> 25:10.724
will turn
against you.

25:10.725 --> 25:12.424
Enough!

25:12.426 --> 25:16.178
Please. Enough.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.899
I don't care
about witch politics.

25:18.900 --> 25:20.851
I don't care about
your ridiculous,

25:20.852 --> 25:22.802
little harvest ritual.

25:22.803 --> 25:26.907
What I care about
is this trinket.

25:26.908 --> 25:32.907
Undo its curse, or I'll show you
things worst than death.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.447
[Scoffs]

25:34.448 --> 25:37.484
Dark objects don't come
with an off switch.

25:37.485 --> 25:39.719
The curse took root
in Sophie.

25:39.720 --> 25:44.340
She's linked
to your devil child.

25:44.342 --> 25:47.210
It's just
a matter of time.

25:47.211 --> 25:50.664
She's burning up.
We need to do this now.

25:50.665 --> 25:53.699
Sophie: Get her
in the water.

25:53.701 --> 25:55.385
I don't see how
a midnight swim

25:55.386 --> 25:56.653
is supposed
to help.

25:56.654 --> 25:58.021
Her temperature
is sky high,

25:58.022 --> 26:00.023
and the water, with
the help of the herbs,

26:00.024 --> 26:02.275
should cool us down.

26:02.276 --> 26:03.693
Drink this.

26:03.694 --> 26:05.111
You're gonna have to get
her heart rate down.

26:05.112 --> 26:06.812
And how do you
suggest I do that?

26:06.814 --> 26:08.365
Hold her.

26:08.366 --> 26:09.515
It's a natural human remedy to slow the heart beating

26:09.516 --> 26:10.850
and reduce
blood pressure.

26:10.851 --> 26:12.202
Rebekah:
This is never gonna work.

26:12.203 --> 26:14.287
Davina will
break that link.

26:14.288 --> 26:16.322
We just need time.

26:38.562 --> 26:44.517
Phesmatos,
omnio ligata soluto.

26:44.518 --> 26:46.436
Oh, I can't breathe.
Ok.

26:46.437 --> 26:48.071
Take long,
deep breaths.

26:48.072 --> 26:50.824
Hayley, look at me.
Long, deep breaths.

26:50.825 --> 26:52.775
Just focus on the
sound of my voice.

26:55.111 --> 26:58.915
You'll be ok.
You'll be ok.

26:58.916 --> 27:04.996
Phesmatos, omnio ligata soluto.

27:04.997 --> 27:09.875
Vingulia cordit...

27:11.795 --> 27:14.430
Aah! Aah aah!

27:21.554 --> 27:23.022
Agh!

27:29.779 --> 27:32.315
[Panting]

27:32.316 --> 27:35.669
I just felt it lift.

27:35.670 --> 27:37.737
Oh...

27:37.738 --> 27:40.456
[Panting]

27:48.632 --> 27:49.799
Sophie: Elijah.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.834
Oh...

28:05.565 --> 28:07.767
Let's go.

28:07.768 --> 28:10.470
Sophie: Elijah...

28:10.471 --> 28:13.082
As soon as your
brother finds out

28:13.083 --> 28:14.867
that the link
is broken,

28:14.868 --> 28:16.735
he'll kill Agnes.

28:16.736 --> 28:19.705
I know you don't
owe me anything,

28:19.706 --> 28:24.042
but please don't
let him kill her.

28:25.678 --> 28:28.264
Sophie: Elijah,
she's our only access

28:28.265 --> 28:30.683
to the power
we need to survive.

28:30.684 --> 28:32.968
Promise me that
you'll stop him.

28:32.970 --> 28:34.853
[Dialing cell phone]

28:36.105 --> 28:38.975
[Telephone rings]

28:38.976 --> 28:41.594
It's me.
Where are you?

28:41.595 --> 28:44.981
Don't hurt her.
I'll be there shortly.

28:44.982 --> 28:46.816
[Beep]

28:46.817 --> 28:48.984
Elijah: I'll make you
one last promise.

28:50.453 --> 28:52.654
I won't let my brother
kill Agnes.

29:01.964 --> 29:05.917
I know you were just
using me to save your people,

29:05.919 --> 29:09.504
but try it again,
I'll kill you.

29:24.739 --> 29:27.475
The unlinking worked.

29:27.476 --> 29:28.610
Maybe now we
can make plans...

29:28.611 --> 29:29.694
Not now, Rebekah.

29:29.695 --> 29:30.912
Can we discuss this
when I return?

29:30.913 --> 29:32.079
I won't be here
when you return.

29:35.817 --> 29:37.918
That sounds like
a good-bye.

29:40.789 --> 29:43.041
I guess it is.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.175
I only came
to New Orleans

29:44.176 --> 29:47.061
to make sure you
were safe.

29:47.062 --> 29:49.764
You are.

29:49.765 --> 29:51.266
I thought that
I might be able

29:51.267 --> 29:52.767
to convince you
to come with me,

29:52.768 --> 29:54.903
but here you are,
rushing off

29:54.904 --> 29:57.071
into whatever
Klaus and Marcel

29:57.072 --> 29:59.908
and the witches
have cooked up,

29:59.909 --> 30:02.861
and I finally
get it.

30:02.862 --> 30:05.229
You'll never
leave this city.

30:07.065 --> 30:09.533
You'll never
leave Klaus.

30:13.488 --> 30:16.691
Then you should stay.

30:16.692 --> 30:19.244
This thing that you and
Klaus and Marcel have,

30:19.245 --> 30:20.794
I want no part of it.

30:23.465 --> 30:27.335
I just want to be free.

30:27.336 --> 30:30.587
Well, then go.

30:35.510 --> 30:37.594
You are free.

30:55.163 --> 30:57.499
Rebekah...

30:57.500 --> 30:59.284
Twice in one night.

30:59.285 --> 31:02.787
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

31:02.788 --> 31:04.839
Call me old-fashioned,
but I believe

31:04.840 --> 31:08.760
farewells are best
in-person.

31:08.761 --> 31:10.144
Got Elijah back,
and now you're both

31:10.145 --> 31:12.380
gonna tuck tail
and run.

31:12.381 --> 31:15.884
Smart girl.

31:15.885 --> 31:17.852
Have a nice life.

31:17.853 --> 31:19.804
He's staying,
and I'm not running.

31:19.805 --> 31:21.439
I'm disembarking
a sinking ship.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.640
People been saying
the city has been

31:22.641 --> 31:24.542
sinking since
I was a boy.

31:24.543 --> 31:27.278
It ain't
going anywhere,

31:27.279 --> 31:32.767
but, hey, how about
one for the road?

31:32.768 --> 31:35.036
Why, so you can
liquor me up

31:35.037 --> 31:37.070
and convince me
to stay?

31:41.292 --> 31:45.380
Why else did you
come here?

31:45.381 --> 31:48.081
I came to say
good-bye.

31:52.971 --> 31:55.639
Then say it.

32:02.146 --> 32:04.565
Good riddance.

32:33.294 --> 32:36.514
You're a piece
of work, Agnes,

32:36.515 --> 32:38.549
but guess what.

32:38.550 --> 32:42.503
I'm quite a piece
of work myself.

32:42.504 --> 32:45.690
You know, I contemplated
leaving bits of you

32:45.691 --> 32:50.028
artfully arranged
outside your family's tomb.

32:50.029 --> 32:53.898
I thought it would leave
a fitting message.

32:53.899 --> 32:56.818
Don't touch
my family.

32:56.819 --> 32:58.619
Elijah: Leave her.

33:01.456 --> 33:04.625
I gave my word.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.495
You tend to give
your word

33:07.496 --> 33:09.998
at the most inopportune
times, brother.

33:09.999 --> 33:12.583
We've been doing things
your way all day.

33:12.584 --> 33:14.168
Come on.

33:14.169 --> 33:16.821
Just one little snap,
and it's toodle-loo, Agnes.

33:16.822 --> 33:18.406
She deserves it.

33:18.407 --> 33:21.559
Niklaus, do not
make another move.

33:21.560 --> 33:25.212
You have asked
for my forgiveness.

33:25.213 --> 33:29.651
I will Grant you
that forgiveness,

33:29.652 --> 33:32.686
but do not make me
break my word.

33:46.784 --> 33:48.618
My noble brother.

33:49.787 --> 33:52.406
How's that for
personal growth, eh?

33:52.407 --> 33:55.792
Still, it is just like you
to spoil my fun.

33:57.462 --> 34:00.931
Oh, not necessarily.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.767
Agh!

34:05.186 --> 34:08.304
Aah!

34:13.311 --> 34:15.362
[Splat]
[Splat]

34:16.864 --> 34:19.567
I swore you
would not die

34:19.568 --> 34:21.134
by my brother's hand.

34:23.404 --> 34:25.907
I said nothing

34:25.908 --> 34:27.456
of my own.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.996
No one hurts
my family and lives.

34:32.998 --> 34:34.248
[Crack]

34:34.248 --> 34:35.415
[Thud]

34:37.722 --> 34:39.969
No one.

34:56.672 --> 34:58.039
Mm.

35:00.626 --> 35:04.179
I've been away from this
home almost 100 years,

35:04.180 --> 35:07.299
and you haven't changed
a thing in my bedroom.

35:07.300 --> 35:10.352
I guess I was holding out
hope that you'd come back to it,

35:10.353 --> 35:13.689
although I imagine it's
not quite as comfortable

35:13.690 --> 35:16.474
as those beds
at the palace royale.

35:19.228 --> 35:21.947
It's plenty
comfortable.

35:21.948 --> 35:23.064
I'm famished.

35:28.186 --> 35:30.289
Nah. Apples
aren't my thing.

35:30.290 --> 35:32.207
They were your favorite
once upon a time.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.525
Yeah. They were.

35:33.526 --> 35:34.627
Get my ass beat
if I ever ate them

35:34.628 --> 35:35.911
working
on that plantation,

35:35.912 --> 35:38.080
even spoiled ones.

35:38.081 --> 35:40.132
Now they just
remind me of a time

35:40.133 --> 35:42.868
when I couldn't
have things.

35:42.869 --> 35:45.970
Well, now you can have
whatever you want.

35:47.723 --> 35:50.476
Come with me.

35:50.477 --> 35:51.843
And go where,
Rebekah?

35:51.845 --> 35:53.479
Ever we want to.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.147
We can build
a home together.

35:55.148 --> 35:58.067
We can leave behind
Klaus and this city

35:58.068 --> 36:00.235
and those orphan
Annie vampires.

36:00.236 --> 36:03.405
Whoa, those orphan Annie
vampires are my family,

36:03.406 --> 36:04.657
and this city
is my home.

36:04.658 --> 36:07.159
It was my home,
too, once. I left.

36:07.160 --> 36:10.729
You ran. I stayed.

36:10.730 --> 36:13.565
This empire, it thrives
because of me,

36:13.566 --> 36:16.451
and you want me
to run.

36:16.453 --> 36:18.671
A man does not
run from his home.

36:18.672 --> 36:19.838
I have lived
a lot longer

36:19.839 --> 36:21.306
than you, marcellus.

36:21.307 --> 36:24.076
I have seen kings
rise and fall.

36:24.077 --> 36:26.261
If there is one thing
I know to be true,

36:26.262 --> 36:29.264
it is that no matter how
big your empire becomes,

36:29.265 --> 36:31.416
it is nothing

36:31.417 --> 36:35.104
if you have no one
to share it with.

36:35.105 --> 36:40.942
You want New Orleans,
have it.

36:45.614 --> 36:47.515
I won't be here
to stop you.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.250
Where is he?

37:05.251 --> 37:06.335
I've been trying
to find him all day.

37:06.336 --> 37:07.503
Marcel knows that
Niklaus lied

37:07.504 --> 37:09.138
about where
he lives.

37:09.139 --> 37:11.289
I'm not his damn
keeper, Josh.

37:11.290 --> 37:14.560
Fine. Just tell him
to call me, please.

37:14.561 --> 37:16.177
Ok.

37:27.656 --> 37:30.024
Uh!
Oh! Ooh!

37:39.835 --> 37:41.486
[Knocks]

37:41.487 --> 37:44.205
Oh, what the hell,
Josh?

37:45.257 --> 37:47.325
Hi there.

37:48.427 --> 37:50.846
I'm Marcel.

37:50.847 --> 37:52.645
I don't think
we've met.

37:59.021 --> 38:01.390
What are you
doing here?

38:01.391 --> 38:03.642
Do you remember
the promise I made you?

38:03.643 --> 38:05.777
Promise? No.

38:08.410 --> 38:10.399
Yes.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.901
You promised you'd find out
what happened to Sean.

38:12.902 --> 38:15.871
And I kept my word.

38:15.872 --> 38:17.940
Your twin brother's
behavior

38:17.941 --> 38:20.542
was not born
of natural causes.

38:20.543 --> 38:23.712
A witch hexed him to
commit those murders

38:23.713 --> 38:26.098
and to kill himself.

38:26.099 --> 38:28.217
I knew it.

38:28.218 --> 38:32.503
I knew
he wasn't crazy.

38:32.505 --> 38:34.590
Who is this witch?

38:34.591 --> 38:37.259
Oh, you needn't trouble
yourself over her.

38:37.260 --> 38:41.980
She has already paid for
her actions in blood.

38:41.981 --> 38:44.600
What? Wait.
You killed somebody?

38:44.601 --> 38:47.575
Well, I had a hand
in the matter, yeah.

38:50.906 --> 38:52.524
Forgive me if I'm
a little surprised

38:52.525 --> 38:53.725
by your reaction.

38:53.726 --> 38:55.944
How the hell am I
supposed to react?

38:55.945 --> 38:57.663
You just made me culpable
in a revenge murder

38:57.664 --> 38:59.031
I never asked for.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.166
I've been alive for
a thousand years,

39:01.167 --> 39:02.868
and, I can assure you,
many people have died

39:02.869 --> 39:04.503
for far less.

39:04.504 --> 39:07.673
Besides, now you
can find comfort

39:07.674 --> 39:09.758
in the truth.

39:09.759 --> 39:13.846
The truth?
You compel me.

39:13.847 --> 39:15.580
You make me at peace
with something

39:15.581 --> 39:18.300
that should be
tearing me up inside.

39:18.301 --> 39:22.604
I don't know how,
but I will undo

39:22.605 --> 39:26.391
whatever the hell it is
you've done to me,

39:26.392 --> 39:29.278
and when I do,
you're gonna wish

39:29.279 --> 39:31.947
you never
laid eyes on me.

39:31.948 --> 39:34.482
[Music playing]

39:49.331 --> 39:52.251
Marcel: Hey...

39:52.252 --> 39:54.720
Where you been?

39:54.721 --> 39:58.306
Not still mad about our tiff
the other night, are you?

40:02.327 --> 40:04.496
Water under the bridge.

40:04.497 --> 40:07.182
Cami is all yours
if you're interested.

40:07.183 --> 40:08.817
I'm feeling like now
is not the right time

40:08.818 --> 40:11.737
for me to pursue
a relationship.

40:11.738 --> 40:14.907
Life is all about
timing, you know?

40:14.908 --> 40:17.709
Speaking of, I swung
by your place earlier

40:17.710 --> 40:19.161
to commiserate
over a drink,

40:19.162 --> 40:22.531
but I must've
just missed you.

40:22.532 --> 40:26.651
Oh, the palace royale
didn't suit me.

40:26.652 --> 40:28.670
I moved on
weeks ago.

40:28.671 --> 40:34.342
No. I mean
your other place.

40:44.586 --> 40:46.221
Hayley.

40:46.222 --> 40:48.673
Marcel: Interesting location
to put down your roots,

40:48.674 --> 40:53.478
same plantation
where I was a slave.

40:53.479 --> 40:56.531
I guess that's why you
never invited me over.

40:56.532 --> 41:00.685
Well, how rude of me.
I'll speak to Elijah.

41:00.686 --> 41:02.287
I'm sure he'll be
pleased to host

41:02.288 --> 41:04.206
you and Davina
for the evening,

41:04.207 --> 41:05.874
especially
after you were

41:05.875 --> 41:08.409
so hospitable
to him.

41:13.999 --> 41:16.083
Good.

41:17.219 --> 41:19.971
I look forward to it.

41:25.927 --> 41:28.562
[Cell phone rings]

41:29.881 --> 41:32.985
Od-bye means
good-bye, Elijah.

41:32.986 --> 41:34.569
Is she with you?

41:34.570 --> 41:36.238
What the hell are
you talking about?

41:36.239 --> 41:38.824
Hayley is gone.
Where is she?

41:38.825 --> 41:40.608
What?

41:42.327 --> 41:44.495
Marcel was here.
