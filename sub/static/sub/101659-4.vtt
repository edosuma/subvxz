we should consider

you mean a barely

you diss back, so...

there's a 90% chance
the weak baby will die.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.182
But if we do
an amnioinfusion
to save the weak baby,

18:35.315 --> 18:38.418
there's an 85% chance
that strong baby will die.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.487
It's the better option.

which baby lives?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.527
Kenzie's body
has already made
that choice.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.762
If there's
a strong baby
and a weak baby,

18:49.896 --> 18:51.130
it's pretty clear
which one we save.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.265

the fittest.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.436

19:01.674 --> 19:03.943
Aren't the strong
morally obligated
to help the weak?

19:04.076 --> 19:06.846
And if they don't,
isn't everybody
ultimately worse off?

19:09.449 --> 19:11.618
Neither baby
has to die.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.955
Delayed interval delivery.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.625
We induce labor,
deliver the
strong twin,

19:18.758 --> 19:21.027
then stop the labor
to keep the weak twin
in utero

19:21.160 --> 19:22.795
until his lungs mature.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.832
The chances of
stopping labor
are very slim.

19:25.965 --> 19:29.602
That's true. There's
about a 70% chance that
both babies would die.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.304
Which makes it
the worst possible
choice.

ask Kenzie.

No, we don't.

the slightest chance
of saving both babies,

she won't listen
to any alternatives.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.882

it's a terrible option.

good options here,

this time, that's okay.

You'll learn something.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.945

You're a wonderful teacher.

it got
really bad,
