Matt: HOW THE HELL WOULD I

09:17.250 --> 09:17.989
KNOW THAT?

09:17.990 --> 09:19.389
Kit: THESE ARE FINGERNAIL MARKS.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.709
WHEN MEN SCRATCH THEY CAUSE

09:20.720 --> 09:22.688
SHALLOW, UNEVEN CUTS. THESE RUN

09:22.690 --> 09:24.226
DEEP AND CONSISTENT. SOMEONE

09:24.230 --> 09:25.754
WITH LONG MANICURED FINGERNAILS

09:25.760 --> 09:27.955
DID THIS. I WISH THEY'D SCRAPED

09:27.960 --> 09:28.927
TH ESE FOR POLISH.

09:28.930 --> 09:29.862
Matt: YEAH, WELL, WHATEVER. LIKE

AMEND THE REPORT AND MAKE

09:41.410 --> 09:42.843
SURE THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER

09:42.850 --> 09:44.806
SEES IT.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.117
Christian: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.656
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.249
Christian: THAT DIDN'T STOP YOU

09:55.260 --> 09:56.158
FROM STRAPPING THE ELECTRODES

09:56.160 --> 09:56.785

10:02.260 --> 10:03.227
Kit: YOU'RE TAKING THE LEASH

10:03.230 --> 10:05.892
OFF? BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE

10:05.900 --> 10:07.629
WHAT YOU HEAR.

10:12.710 --> 10:13.734
HAVE YOU COMMITTED A CRIME IN

10:13.740 --> 10:16.334
THE LAST FEW WEEKS, MATT? RAPE,

10:23.120 --> 10:24.747

10:24.750 --> 10:26.388
MCNAMARA. PEOPLE WHO GET

10:26.390 --> 10:28.278
ASSAULTED FOR NO REASON DON'T

10:28.290 --> 10:30.019
CONCEAL FACTS. THEY DON'T FORGET

10:30.030 --> 10:31.258
HOW MANY PEOPLE ATTACKED THEM OR

IF THEY WERE MEN OR WOMEN.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.895
Matt: WHOA. I GOT JUMPED. I

THAT WORKS, DOCTOR. YOU NEED LAB

10:55.280 --> 10:56.315
RESULTS QUICKLY, YOU JUST NEED

10:56.320 --> 10:58.788

11:16.910 --> 11:18.935
THEY WERE MEN!

11:26.510 --> 11:33.848
THEY WERE MEN DRESSED AS WOMEN.

11:33.860 --> 11:34.918
ONE OF THEM MADE A PASS AT ME

11:34.920 --> 11:36.080
OUTSIDE OF A SHE-MALE BAR, AND

11:36.090 --> 11:37.250
I BEAT THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF

Julia: WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT
