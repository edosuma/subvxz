00:22.300 --> 00:25.877
<i>In the territory of New Mexico,</i>
<i>toward the end of the Civil War...</i>

00:25.977 --> 00:30.134
<i>an Indian, Sierra Charriba,</i>
<i>and his 47 Apache warriors...</i>

00:30.267 --> 00:35.178
<i>raided, sacked, and looted an area</i>
<i>almost three times the size of Texas.</i>

00:35.814 --> 00:38.513
<i>On October 31, 1864...</i>

00:38.613 --> 00:41.436
<i>an entire company</i>
<i>of the 5th United States Cavalry...</i>

00:41.536 --> 00:44.019
<i>sent out from Fort Benlin to destroy him...</i>

00:44.239 --> 00:47.738
<i>was ambushed and massacred</i>
<i>at the Rostes ranch.</i>

00:48.368 --> 00:52.527
<i>We are indebted to Timothy Ryan, bugler,</i>
<i>5th United States Cavalry...</i>

00:52.627 --> 00:56.032
<i>the company's sole survivor, for his diary...</i>

00:56.132 --> 01:00.754
<i>the only existing record of this tragedy,</i>
<i>and the campaign that followed.</i>

01:01.300 --> 01:04.503
Let go of me! I want my mom!

01:20.402 --> 01:23.522
Pony soldier, I am Sierra Charriba.

01:24.907 --> 01:27.113
Who you send against me now?

03:46.723 --> 03:49.212
- Lieutenant!
- Sir?

03:49.312 --> 03:52.509
Take the first, second and third squads
and cover the ridge sides.

03:52.609 --> 03:54.722
- Yes, sir.
- If I signal you to come, you come.

03:54.822 --> 03:56.888
If I signal you to charge, you charge.

03:56.988 --> 03:59.267
If I signal you to run,
you follow me and run.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.184
- Otherwise hold your position.
- Yes, sir.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.936
- First squad to the right.
- Mr. Potts.

04:03.036 --> 04:04.776
Second squad to the left.

04:07.078 --> 04:08.276
Major.

04:10.206 --> 04:14.074
I'm a long way from Gettysburg.
Any suggestions?

04:19.925 --> 04:23.627
Let's go have a look, slow and easy.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.318
To the left. To the right.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.917
<i>November 1.</i>

04:53.669 --> 04:57.534
<i>This morning I returned with the relief</i>
<i>column to the scene of the massacre.</i>

04:57.634 --> 04:59.455
<i>The Major had expressed little hope...</i>

04:59.555 --> 05:02.544
<i>that any of the civilians or troopers</i>
<i>would be alive.</i>

05:02.644 --> 05:04.671
<i>But Samuel Potts, the Major's scout...</i>

05:04.771 --> 05:07.714
<i>knew Apaches well</i>
<i>and said they never kill boy children.</i>

05:07.814 --> 05:11.091
<i>They take them as captives</i>
<i>and raise them as warriors.</i>

05:11.191 --> 05:14.354
<i>He felt the three Rostes boys</i>
<i>may still be alive.</i>

05:15.067 --> 05:18.151
<i>But he had no such hope</i>
<i>for their sister, Beth.</i>

05:18.987 --> 05:20.481
<i>He was right.</i>

05:20.614 --> 05:23.274
<i>I looked down at her</i>
<i>and thought with hatred of Riago...</i>

05:23.374 --> 05:26.284
<i>our Apache scout, who led us to this place.</i>

05:26.453 --> 05:28.327
<i>His body was never found...</i>

05:28.497 --> 05:32.710
<i>and I will always wonder if he escaped</i>
<i>the massacre or was part of it.</i>

05:39.468 --> 05:40.962
Hold your positions!

05:52.147 --> 05:56.441
- That scarf belonged to Lt. Brannin.
- That's for you, Major.

06:13.963 --> 06:16.828
I hope he was dead
when they did that to him.

06:16.928 --> 06:19.795
If he was dead they wouldn't have bothered.

06:22.263 --> 06:25.711
- Go cut him down, Sergeant.
- Brannin was a soldier, Amos.

06:25.811 --> 06:28.346
Goes with the pretty girls and the pension.

06:31.439 --> 06:35.021
How much chance have I
of getting those children back?

06:35.609 --> 06:38.231
One chance in a thousand, I'd say...

06:38.738 --> 06:41.989
if they gave you a division
and a year to do it, at least.

06:42.784 --> 06:45.109
Much chance of that, is there?

06:47.373 --> 06:51.323
I'll take five days
to get men, horses, ordnance.

06:52.754 --> 06:57.578
On the fifth day I want you back
at Fort Benlin to tell me where Charriba is.

06:57.678 --> 07:00.380
I'll get the children and I'll get him.

07:06.601 --> 07:08.423
- Sam.
- Yeah?

07:08.523 --> 07:12.054
Don't get yourself killed.
That would inconvenience me.

07:34.089 --> 07:35.089
Ryan!

08:01.117 --> 08:02.856
<i>With so many troopers away...</i>

08:02.956 --> 08:06.817
<i>five Confederate prisoners</i>
<i>broke out of Fort Benlin and escaped.</i>

08:06.917 --> 08:09.038
<i>We trapped them on our way back.</i>

08:22.764 --> 08:24.638
Evening, Ben.

08:25.935 --> 08:27.130
Evening, Amos.

08:27.230 --> 08:29.217
Should have tried it before I took command.

08:29.317 --> 08:33.263
Command of what, the burial detail?

08:36.446 --> 08:38.562
- Move them out, Lieutenant.
- Move them out!

08:38.662 --> 08:41.610
Troops, right! Pair of twos, right!

09:10.815 --> 09:13.686
I brought back your wandering boys,
Captain.

09:14.319 --> 09:16.723
Now you tell me how they got loose.

09:16.823 --> 09:19.988
They clubbed two guards
and went over the wall.

09:20.533 --> 09:23.483
I'd like to point out, Amos,
at the time of the escape...

09:23.583 --> 09:27.328
131 men of this command
were half a day's march from here...

09:27.541 --> 09:31.753
either digging graves or rotting in the sun,
waiting to be buried.

09:33.422 --> 09:38.050
I want every prisoner that can walk
on this parade ground in 10 minutes.

09:38.386 --> 09:40.759
Including those in irons.

09:41.431 --> 09:43.507
Bugler, sound assembly.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.027
They're gonna give us a party, Captain.

09:54.903 --> 09:56.481
It sure looks like it.

09:56.947 --> 10:00.233
You thieves, renegades, deserters...

10:01.536 --> 10:05.533
you gentlemen of the South.
I want some volunteers.

10:06.666 --> 10:10.250
I want volunteers to fight
the Apache Sierra Charriba.

10:11.880 --> 10:15.712
I need horse soldiers.
Men who can ride, men who can shoot.

10:15.843 --> 10:18.209
In return I promise you nothing.

10:18.309 --> 10:22.084
Saddle sores, short rations,
maybe a bullet in your belly.

10:22.184 --> 10:26.429
And free air to breathe,
a fair share of tobacco, quarter pay.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.132
My good will.

10:28.232 --> 10:31.729
Best offices for pardons
and paroles when we get back.

10:32.443 --> 10:35.016
I don't know
what that might be worth to you.

10:36.196 --> 10:40.658
But I do know if any man signs on with me
and then attempts to desert...

10:41.202 --> 10:43.575
I will shoot him out of hand.

10:44.915 --> 10:48.613
From you I'll accept one man
with some experience of command...

10:48.713 --> 10:50.668
as an acting lieutenant.

10:52.256 --> 10:53.667
Captain Tyreen...

10:55.134 --> 10:58.582
does the prospect of serving
under your country's flag once again...

10:58.682 --> 11:02.463
seem more attractive
than dragging its chains in this prison?

11:03.851 --> 11:06.342
It is not my country, Major Dundee.

11:08.147 --> 11:10.519
I damn its flag and I damn you...

11:11.067 --> 11:14.898
and I would rather hang than serve.

11:24.749 --> 11:27.240
Corporal Veitch just died, sir.

11:29.545 --> 11:31.538
And hang you will!

11:37.220 --> 11:39.545
You and your four good friends.

11:39.889 --> 11:43.092
You're going to stand trial
on a charge of murder.

11:43.309 --> 11:45.800
That guard you clubbed just died.

12:07.836 --> 12:11.533
You've been found guilty of the charges
and specifications here mentioned.

12:11.633 --> 12:14.541
It is the sentence of this court
that on November 6...

12:14.641 --> 12:18.085
at 6:00 a.m. you shall be hanged by the neck
until dead.

12:18.847 --> 12:22.512
Remove the prisoners,
with the exception of Benjamin Tyreen.

12:22.684 --> 12:25.519
Right face, forward march.

12:25.728 --> 12:27.603
These proceedings are closed.

12:48.545 --> 12:49.873
Sit down.

12:58.013 --> 12:59.388
Five years.

13:01.225 --> 13:04.143
You're still blaming me
instead of yourself, huh?

13:07.482 --> 13:10.431
I'll say one thing, Ben,
you sure haven't mellowed any.

13:10.531 --> 13:13.476
When are you going to learn
you made all your own troubles?

13:13.576 --> 13:15.561
Who had me cashiered out of the regiment?

13:15.661 --> 13:17.899
I cast one vote out of five.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.693
Two of those votes were for my acquittal.

13:20.793 --> 13:23.195
But not you. Not my own captain.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.238
Not my own friend.

13:26.338 --> 13:29.245
The conscience of the court
was not my concern.

13:29.345 --> 13:31.377
What did concern you, Amos?

13:35.428 --> 13:38.755
- That the man I killed was a Yankee?
- He was your brother officer.

13:38.855 --> 13:40.722
It was a duel of honour.

13:41.101 --> 13:44.220
You're Southern born,
you knew what that meant.

13:45.021 --> 13:48.015
If he had killed me, and he had a chance...

13:48.115 --> 13:50.431
- would you have convicted him?
- I would.

13:50.531 --> 13:52.017
You're a liar.

13:52.117 --> 13:55.316
You voted to please the generals
in Washington.

13:55.825 --> 14:00.202
You voted a promotion
for Amos Charles Dundee.

14:00.913 --> 14:04.863
You're a traitor to your country, Ben.
You gonna blame me for that, too?

14:05.292 --> 14:06.668
Sergeant!

14:09.548 --> 14:10.923
Yes, sir.

14:12.551 --> 14:16.085
I should have known better
than to try to talk to you.

14:18.014 --> 14:19.924
You'll try again, Major.

14:25.564 --> 14:29.307
<i>The Major had asked for thieves,</i>
<i>renegades and deserters...</i>

14:29.407 --> 14:34.028
<i>and that's what he got.</i>
<i>After four hours he had accepted only three.</i>

14:38.619 --> 14:40.320
Ryan, what are you doing here?

14:40.420 --> 14:43.283
I'm volunteering, too, sir. I've earned it, sir.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.876
You'll need a bugler, sir.

14:48.046 --> 14:50.205
- Stand over there.
- Yes, sir.

14:51.008 --> 14:53.291
Benjamin Priam, sir.

14:53.391 --> 14:55.342
What do you do?

14:55.971 --> 14:57.631
What did you say?

14:58.307 --> 15:01.261
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
- I'm a horse thief!

15:03.687 --> 15:05.596
You a good horse thief?

15:08.401 --> 15:10.185
The best there is, sir.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.603
Sign your name or make your mark.

15:13.573 --> 15:15.978
I need horses and mules, Mr. Priam.

15:16.078 --> 15:18.532
Here's the amount you'll have to spend...

15:19.455 --> 15:21.780
and here is your safe-conduct.

15:22.333 --> 15:24.072
- Do you need an escort?
- No, sir.

15:24.172 --> 15:25.991
He'll be back, sir.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.328
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

15:31.634 --> 15:34.038
- Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

15:34.138 --> 15:36.888
- Get Lt. Andreen.
- On duty, Major.

15:39.642 --> 15:42.097
- Lt. Fredericks.
- Hospital.

15:45.190 --> 15:47.479
- Lewison.
- Officer of the day.

15:48.777 --> 15:50.935
- Sgt. Cable?
- Patrol.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.618
- Get me Lt. Graham.
- Yes, sir.

16:05.211 --> 16:08.580
- Five hours, five men.
- You need a regiment.

16:09.215 --> 16:12.580
Charriba can't be taken by a pick-up
company of garrison troopers.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.793
You should know that by now.

16:14.893 --> 16:17.010
What are you trying to say, Frank?

16:17.140 --> 16:19.340
Come on, speak up. Spit it out!

16:19.440 --> 16:22.094
I'm not trying to say that
the massacre was your fault.

16:22.194 --> 16:25.635
I'm saying that you should recognise
that your transfer to this post...

16:25.735 --> 16:28.651
was a disciplinary action, pure and simple.

16:28.987 --> 16:34.112
And if you try to fight your own war again
as you did at Gettysburg, they'll break you.

16:35.660 --> 16:40.030
They won't break me,
not if I get Charriba and those kids.

16:40.130 --> 16:42.448
Has it occurred to you, Major...

16:42.834 --> 16:46.115
that the Apache will undoubtedly
enter Mexico for the winter?

16:46.215 --> 16:50.077
Mexico presently contains an army
of 30,000 French soldiers.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.132
Yes, it's occurred to me.

16:52.927 --> 16:57.221
Frank, I am a professional soldier,
I'm not a prison keeper.

16:58.224 --> 17:01.884
Now this is something that's gotta be done
and I'm gonna do it...

17:01.985 --> 17:02.985
now!

17:05.192 --> 17:09.271
Are you pursuing the Apache, Major,
or a promotion?

17:13.116 --> 17:14.855
Whatever my reasons are, Frank...

17:14.954 --> 17:19.079
you'd better get down on your knees
and pray to God I don't take you with me.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.417
I suppose you intend to strip this garrison.

17:23.919 --> 17:27.618
I will take just 10 men from the command.
Volunteers.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.578
The bulk of my force
will be made up of prisoners.

17:30.678 --> 17:33.585
You'd be well advised
not to accept Confederate prisoners...

17:33.685 --> 17:34.874
even if they're forthcoming.

17:34.974 --> 17:37.505
In my absence,
you'll assume command of the garrison.

17:37.605 --> 17:40.383
Discharge all duties
incumbent upon that command.

17:40.483 --> 17:43.349
I have, as you can see...

17:44.858 --> 17:48.441
appended to your orders
a statement over my signature...

17:50.781 --> 17:53.980
to the effect that I assume
total and complete responsibility...

17:54.080 --> 17:55.903
for all such actions.

17:56.286 --> 17:59.240
Here. Does that cover it?

18:01.792 --> 18:02.990
No, sir.

18:03.585 --> 18:07.411
I consider it my responsibility
to notify General Carlton...

18:07.511 --> 18:11.582
of what I believe to be an irresponsible
and dangerous course of action.

18:11.682 --> 18:14.844
- Do your worst.
- You could be shot for this, Amos.

18:15.473 --> 18:18.391
My executioners will have to stand in line.

18:21.272 --> 18:22.766
That's all, Captain.

18:32.867 --> 18:34.740
Corporal Tinney!

18:36.579 --> 18:37.579
Sir?

18:39.081 --> 18:41.489
Where in hell is Lt. Graham?

18:46.089 --> 18:47.500
Carry on.

19:21.251 --> 19:25.166
- The Major's waiting to see you, sir.
- Thank you, Corporal.

19:34.139 --> 19:36.263
- Sir!
- Lieutenant Graham.

19:37.769 --> 19:41.553
- They're not much, are they?
- No, sir, they don't seem to be.

19:45.902 --> 19:46.933
Cigar?

19:48.154 --> 19:50.147
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

19:52.575 --> 19:55.862
- Coffee?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

19:56.205 --> 19:58.949
Why did they put you in the cavalry,
Lieutenant?

19:59.049 --> 20:02.706
- Sir?
- Why did they assign you to the cavalry?

20:03.712 --> 20:05.539
You're ordnance, aren't you?

20:06.340 --> 20:08.712
No, sir. Artillery.

20:10.636 --> 20:13.423
- Artillery?
- Yes, sir.

20:52.138 --> 20:55.465
As Napoleon said, "Only thunderbolts
can be preferred to cannon."

20:55.565 --> 20:57.350
- Napoleon?
- Yes, sir!

21:00.898 --> 21:03.900
You'll do, Lieutenant. You'll have to.

21:05.862 --> 21:07.901
I need rifles and ammunition.

21:08.364 --> 21:13.073
It's all listed there in that inventory:
number of rounds, types of ordnance.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.828
You go get them for me.

21:16.790 --> 21:18.165
Forthwith.

21:25.048 --> 21:26.328
Yes, sir!

21:28.843 --> 21:30.172
Lieutenant.

21:31.097 --> 21:33.385
- Sir?
- Where are you going?

21:38.271 --> 21:40.597
I said, "Where are you going?"

21:41.358 --> 21:42.733
To obtain...

21:44.069 --> 21:45.392
these weapons?

21:45.492 --> 21:49.070
And just how and where
do you intend to accomplish that?

21:55.747 --> 21:59.362
It has come to my attention that
a supply train from the Ordnance Depot...

21:59.462 --> 22:02.203
at Denver,
en route to the 2nd California Column...

22:02.303 --> 22:04.335
now garrisoned in Santa Fe...

22:04.714 --> 22:08.463
should be encamped tomorrow morning
at the Sand River crossing...

22:08.927 --> 22:10.339
thirty miles away.

22:11.514 --> 22:14.800
Now, if you have the opportunity,
you might just take C Troop.

22:15.144 --> 22:17.931
See if you can be of any assistance.

22:21.358 --> 22:22.852
Yes, sir.

22:26.697 --> 22:28.108
<i>November 4.</i>

22:28.615 --> 22:32.316
<i>Lt. Graham had no official orders,</i>
<i>but this didn't stop him.</i>

22:32.494 --> 22:36.444
<i>He was very persuasive,</i>
<i>with Sgt. Gomez and C Troop standing by.</i>

22:36.999 --> 22:39.205
<i>He took what the Major needed.</i>

22:39.543 --> 22:44.205
<i>We returned with 48 new Henry rifles,</i>
<i>5,000 rounds of ammunition...</i>

22:45.007 --> 22:48.460
<i>and a baby howitzer</i>
<i>for the lieutenant to play with.</i>

23:01.609 --> 23:04.602
I see you transferred back to the artillery,
Lieutenant.

23:04.702 --> 23:05.976
Yes, sir.

23:13.078 --> 23:15.783
<i>Over a hundred civilian prisoners</i>
<i>volunteered...</i>

23:15.998 --> 23:19.946
<i>and from them the Major took six,</i>
<i>and they were doubtful at best.</i>

23:20.046 --> 23:23.371
<i>While we waited for horses,</i>
<i>the rebel prisoners that we needed...</i>

23:23.471 --> 23:25.707
<i>watched the gallows being built.</i>

23:25.884 --> 23:29.922
<i>The gallows on which the Major will hang</i>
<i>Sgt. Chillum, the Hadley brothers...</i>

23:30.022 --> 23:32.054
<i>Jimmy Lee, and their captain.</i>

23:32.225 --> 23:33.600
Captain.

23:34.852 --> 23:37.770
- You figure he's bluffing?
- Sure, he's bluffing.

23:38.606 --> 23:40.678
He needs us much more than we need him.

23:40.778 --> 23:43.557
Captain, that ain't no dance floor
they're building for us.

23:43.657 --> 23:47.062
We just want you to know, sir,
that whatever you figure on...

23:47.162 --> 23:48.983
we're all with you.

23:50.451 --> 23:54.693
<i>Without Confederate volunteers,</i>
<i>the Major was forced to accept cowboys...</i>

23:54.793 --> 23:56.533
<i>drifters and drunks.</i>

23:57.292 --> 24:01.240
You wanted Injun-fighting, mule-packing,
whiskey-drinking volunteers, sir.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.327
Well, by God, you've got one.

24:03.427 --> 24:05.624
What am I going to do with you?

24:05.724 --> 24:09.211
He's the biggest drunk,
but the best packer in the territory, sir.

24:09.311 --> 24:11.298
- What's your name?
- Wiley.

24:12.767 --> 24:15.056
Wiley, make your mark.

24:21.317 --> 24:23.559
- Whiskey?
- All you can drink.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.352
When you've earned it.

24:28.452 --> 24:30.939
Sergeant, throw him in a cell
and dry him out.

24:31.039 --> 24:33.780
- Come on, Wiley.
- I never seen anything like it.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.874
- How many is that, Ryan?
- Twelve, sir.

24:37.293 --> 24:39.416
- Name?
- Dahlstrom.

24:40.421 --> 24:43.454
Any man with a just cause
should travel with the word of God.

24:43.554 --> 24:46.332
With all due respect,
God has nothing to do with it.

24:46.432 --> 24:49.844
I intend to smite the wicked,
not save the heathen.

24:51.224 --> 24:54.724
Seventeen years ago,
I married John and Mary Rostes.

24:56.813 --> 24:59.850
Who that destroyeth my flock,
I will so destroy.

25:00.442 --> 25:01.556
Reverend.

25:03.862 --> 25:05.397
<i>November 5.</i>

25:05.497 --> 25:09.066
<i>The Confederate prisoners are angry</i>
<i>and uneasy, waiting for tomorrow...</i>

25:09.166 --> 25:12.659
<i>the day the rebel captain</i>
<i>and his four companions are to hang.</i>

25:13.206 --> 25:15.364
<i>We are fearful of the consequences.</i>

25:17.752 --> 25:20.745
<i>All of us know the Major needs the Captain</i>
<i>and his men...</i>

25:20.845 --> 25:22.583
<i>but the Major is stubborn.</i>

25:23.050 --> 25:26.300
<i>I think he will hang them</i>
<i>if they don't volunteer.</i>

25:48.368 --> 25:51.067
I would like to volunteer, sir.
Me and my six coloureds.

25:51.167 --> 25:53.401
I haven't asked for volunteers
from the command.

25:53.501 --> 25:55.986
- We're doing the asking, sir.
- Why?

25:56.086 --> 25:57.240
To fight, sir.

25:57.340 --> 26:01.630
We've been standing guard
and cleaning stables for nearly two years.

26:03.259 --> 26:06.877
Tomorrow morning you ask
the officer of the day to see me.

26:07.388 --> 26:09.630
You and your six coloureds.

26:10.516 --> 26:11.796
Thank you, sir.

26:16.731 --> 26:19.514
The rebel captain
Ben Tyreen's compliments, sir.

26:19.614 --> 26:21.234
He will see you now.

26:24.573 --> 26:25.771
He will?

26:27.200 --> 26:28.395
Yes, sir.

26:28.495 --> 26:32.358
And he further states that he will
volunteer himself and his men as needed...

26:32.458 --> 26:36.281
for double rations for all prisoners
plus Gen. Carlton's written guarantee...

26:36.381 --> 26:38.948
that all Southern soldiers
who serve with you, sir...

26:39.048 --> 26:41.618
will be automatically granted full pardon.

26:41.718 --> 26:44.385
Now, sir,
if I may be so bold as to suggest <i>...</i>

27:02.404 --> 27:03.519
Guard!

27:05.991 --> 27:07.948
- Open it up.
- Yes, sir.

27:13.832 --> 27:16.537
Major, it has come to my attention...

27:19.172 --> 27:23.218
You kill one of my soldiers and then
have the gall to dictate terms to me?

27:24.053 --> 27:25.753
You're a damn traitor, Ben.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.296
You were a rebel
before you ever saw the South.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.046
And now you're a murderer.

27:30.146 --> 27:33.891
Tomorrow morning, I am going to hang you
and be done with you.

27:34.021 --> 27:35.136
Jailer.

27:38.984 --> 27:40.229
Sergeant!

27:45.116 --> 27:46.688
How many men do you need?

27:46.788 --> 27:48.492
Twenty. Good ones.

27:51.705 --> 27:55.205
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed,
only that.

27:58.297 --> 27:59.495
Agreed.

28:01.092 --> 28:04.675
Then you have my word, Major.
We will serve.

28:06.013 --> 28:08.339
But after that we're going home.

28:10.143 --> 28:12.550
If it's too rich for you...

28:13.563 --> 28:15.468
hang us now and be done with it.

28:15.568 --> 28:18.392
I just might hang you
and that Injun to the same tree, Ben.

28:18.492 --> 28:20.639
You'll play hell getting it done, Amos.

28:20.739 --> 28:24.437
This man will hold lieutenant's rank
under myself and Lt. Graham.

28:25.158 --> 28:26.700
Will you serve?

28:31.331 --> 28:34.250
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed, sir.

28:45.513 --> 28:47.055
Attention!

29:07.578 --> 29:10.532
Lieutenant Graham,
get away from that damn bell!

29:20.592 --> 29:23.919
Priam, they're a bunch of Roman-nosed,
broken-gutted, spavined...

29:24.019 --> 29:27.381
sore-footed, swaybacked dogs.
You call yourself a horse thief?

29:30.936 --> 29:32.394
Samuel Potts!

29:33.188 --> 29:36.272
Those Injuns you got with you
look kind of shy, Samuel.

29:38.985 --> 29:43.233
- They ain't sure they're welcome, Amos.
- Get on up here. I'll buy you a drink.

29:45.701 --> 29:46.701
Ryan!

29:47.620 --> 29:51.120
<i>Today Mr. Potts got back.</i>
<i>With him was Riago.</i>

29:51.667 --> 29:55.000
<i>If Lt. Brannin were alive</i>
<i>he would hang the Apache...</i>

29:55.337 --> 29:56.704
<i>and I would help.</i>

29:56.804 --> 29:58.789
Yeah, but where in Mexico?

30:01.760 --> 30:03.219
The children?

30:04.346 --> 30:08.047
Well, they're skinny,
but doing better than you'd expect.

30:09.309 --> 30:11.183
Making their own arrows now.

30:14.566 --> 30:17.353
That's Riago who rode in with you, isn't it?

30:20.321 --> 30:22.777
They all look alike to you, Amos?

30:24.742 --> 30:26.865
I asked you a question, Sam.

30:31.125 --> 30:32.536
That's Riago.

30:35.254 --> 30:37.081
Where'd you find him?

30:38.591 --> 30:40.548
Didn't. He found me.

30:42.511 --> 30:46.126
He said after the massacre
he hit for the bush, stayed on their trail...

30:46.226 --> 30:48.465
figured I'd be along sooner or later.

30:50.645 --> 30:52.519
I believe him, Amos.

30:55.275 --> 30:57.102
Who's the other one?

30:58.445 --> 31:00.687
He's got a personal score to settle.

31:01.323 --> 31:05.104
Seems old Charriba wouldn't take him
along with him on this last raid.

31:05.204 --> 31:07.194
Said he couldn't be trusted.

31:08.247 --> 31:11.074
Now he's got his mind set
on killing the old man.

31:11.174 --> 31:15.076
Do you expect me to believe these Apaches
will turn against their own families?

31:15.176 --> 31:17.128
Track down their own people?

31:18.508 --> 31:21.508
Why not?
Everyone else seems to be doing it.

31:25.474 --> 31:29.174
Lt. Brannin didn't trust Riago. Right, Ryan?

31:32.689 --> 31:33.934
Yes, sir.

31:37.986 --> 31:40.608
I'm afraid I go along with that, Sam.

31:43.033 --> 31:45.951
Well, you go along with Lt. Brannin then.

31:47.163 --> 31:49.405
Well, you go along without me.

31:51.626 --> 31:52.954
Sam Potts.

32:18.863 --> 32:22.907
Looks like the Union jackets
you gave us didn't quite fit, Major.

32:23.284 --> 32:24.564
So I see.

32:30.167 --> 32:34.331
<i>The last day was spent getting</i>
<i>acquainted with our comrades-in-arms.</i>

32:51.272 --> 32:55.436
<i>Learning how to handle the pack animals</i>
<i>with sureness and dispatch.</i>

32:59.322 --> 33:02.239
<i>And learning the character of our officers.</i>

33:03.118 --> 33:04.696
Troop, fall in!

33:06.121 --> 33:09.491
Foot soldiers,
I want a company of twos on my right.

33:10.210 --> 33:12.997
Cavalry, fall in 20 paces in front of me.

33:15.048 --> 33:18.796
I want a column of twos on my right!
Line up here.

33:22.305 --> 33:24.505
Get that mule out of there!

33:24.605 --> 33:27.298
Fall them in with the artillery,
20 paces in front of me!

33:27.398 --> 33:29.600
Column of twos on my right!

33:29.979 --> 33:31.008
Fall in!

33:31.108 --> 33:33.555
If I tell you one more time,
you're court-martialed!

33:33.655 --> 33:36.560
Why don't you find a horse and mount up,
Lieutenant Graham?

33:36.660 --> 33:38.975
You don't seem
to be doing very well on foot.

33:39.075 --> 33:40.317
Mount up!

33:52.128 --> 33:56.332
<i>November 7, and we were ready,</i>
<i>all who volunteered.</i>

33:56.432 --> 33:59.461
<i>Civilians, criminals, Southerners,</i>
<i>and Negroes.</i>

33:59.636 --> 34:02.918
Gentlemen,
we've given the Major our parole...

34:03.018 --> 34:05.131
and we will serve him until I say we will not.

34:05.231 --> 34:06.420
And until that time...

34:06.520 --> 34:09.594
he will be your commanding officer
and will be treated as such.

34:09.695 --> 34:14.346
And any sign of disrespect to him
will be taken as a personal insult by me.

34:14.446 --> 34:16.810
Don't worry none, Uncle Ben,
when the time comes...

34:16.909 --> 34:19.353
we'll turpentine that caulky,
chicken-picking Yankee.

34:19.454 --> 34:23.197
I am not your uncle,
you redneck peckerwood.

34:24.036 --> 34:28.201
And one more word out of you
and you'll end this campaign in chains.

34:29.751 --> 34:30.831
Attention!

34:36.300 --> 34:40.000
Good luck, Frank.
Give my regards to the General.

34:40.512 --> 34:44.213
I mean for you to have that pleasure
within the week, Amos.

34:45.391 --> 34:47.929
If you don't, good luck.

34:51.107 --> 34:53.514
I have but three orders of march:

34:53.985 --> 34:58.232
If I signal you to come, you come.
If I signal you to charge, you charge.

34:58.406 --> 35:02.156
And if I signal you to run,
you follow me and run like hell.

35:03.370 --> 35:05.410
Move them out, Lieutenant.

35:05.998 --> 35:07.825
- Twos right!
- Twos right!

35:08.167 --> 35:10.076
- Left turn!
- Left turn!

35:42.036 --> 35:44.788
- Whistle me a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.

37:05.874 --> 37:09.739
<i>November 18.</i>
<i>We are now in Texas approaching Mexico.</i>

37:09.839 --> 37:12.076
<i>And the Major</i>
<i>does not mean to be surprised...</i>

37:12.176 --> 37:14.539
<i>by Confederate patrols out of Fort Davis.</i>

37:14.639 --> 37:17.469
- No fires tonight, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

37:18.221 --> 37:21.305
Trooper Hadley,
you are not part of my gun crew.

37:33.445 --> 37:35.105
Cold coffee again.

37:36.698 --> 37:40.281
It's 50 miles to the border,
and 86 to Fort Davis.

37:42.162 --> 37:44.203
I wonder if we'll make it.

37:44.332 --> 37:45.655
Make what, Sergeant Chillum?

37:45.755 --> 37:48.668
Make it back to where we come from,
Captain.

37:49.546 --> 37:53.460
We'll make it. It's just a question of time.

37:55.552 --> 38:00.254
<i>It was just after dawn and we were starting</i>
<i>for the Rio Grande when Riago returned.</i>

38:00.354 --> 38:01.421
<i>I still don't trust him.</i>

38:01.521 --> 38:03.473
- Twos right!
- Major.

38:14.530 --> 38:17.774
Says he got close enough
to smell the stink of many white men.

38:17.874 --> 38:20.190
I wager they're waiting for us
at the river, Amos.

38:20.290 --> 38:24.284
- We'd better walk on water.
- Let's find out what we're made of.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.042
Boy!

38:27.752 --> 38:32.628
Full gallop, son. We'll let those rebels
know there's a Yankee army come to call.

39:07.377 --> 39:08.836
Troop, halt!

39:15.219 --> 39:19.166
Mr. Potts. Sergeant Gomez.
First 12 men across as skirmishers.

39:19.266 --> 39:22.046
- Troop right, roll!
- Lieutenant Graham, move them out!

39:22.146 --> 39:23.636
Column of twos.

40:05.939 --> 40:08.265
Confederate cavalry, Lieutenant.

40:10.945 --> 40:12.902
We don't have much time.

40:15.783 --> 40:18.399
Your word's worth about
as much as your cause.

40:18.499 --> 40:22.907
- Then why don't you release him from it?
- Ben, you gave it, you break it.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.446
And be damned to you.

40:24.546 --> 40:28.368
- What do you want from us anyway?
- I've got what I want, Sergeant.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.122
I've got his word.

40:38.265 --> 40:40.423
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir.

40:41.894 --> 40:43.716
- Move them out.
- Which way, Captain?

40:43.816 --> 40:46.304
To Mexico, you bloody idiot!

40:57.494 --> 41:00.446
<i>November 19. We are in Mexico...</i>

41:00.580 --> 41:03.151
<i>and this day's events</i>
<i>have made it clear to everyone...</i>

41:03.251 --> 41:06.784
<i>that the Major's present war is not</i>
<i>with the South, but with the Apache.</i>

41:06.920 --> 41:09.590
- Lunge!
- That's very good, Aesop.

41:09.715 --> 41:10.878
Thank you, sir.

41:11.008 --> 41:14.834
But as Napoleon said, only thunderbolts
can be preferred to cannon.

41:14.934 --> 41:17.135
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

41:18.182 --> 41:19.557
Order arms.

41:24.898 --> 41:26.522
Thank you, Priam.

41:37.911 --> 41:39.950
Boy, I'm speaking to you!

41:45.503 --> 41:48.208
You're forgetting your manners, nigger.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.802
Come on over here and pull off my boots.

42:03.814 --> 42:05.273
Lieutenant Graham.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.852
Check the pickets.

42:20.623 --> 42:22.415
Did you hear me, boy?

42:39.559 --> 42:41.766
Do it, boy, now.

42:43.647 --> 42:45.023
Let me, son.

42:47.234 --> 42:48.894
Let go off my leg!

43:30.239 --> 43:33.987
Preacher, you sure kick up a lot of dust
with your sermon.

43:35.536 --> 43:38.027
Don't forget your footgear, sonny.

43:38.247 --> 43:42.114
- You started it, now finish it.
- No, we're gonna finish it.

43:42.292 --> 43:45.241
By doggies, Preacher,
now we're gonna get in line for you.

43:45.341 --> 43:49.584
- I'm gonna cut me a piece of you first.
- You southern trash sit down!

43:51.468 --> 43:53.793
Was you talking to me, Sergeant?

43:54.888 --> 43:58.638
Now maybe you don't know it,
but you're fixing to get tried.

44:00.728 --> 44:03.565
You and all the rest of your bluebellies.

44:08.654 --> 44:09.852
Trooper!

44:39.812 --> 44:44.054
Mr. Aesop, we would like to compliment you
and your men...

44:44.154 --> 44:47.685
on the way you handled the river crossing
this afternoon.

44:49.405 --> 44:50.899
Thank you, sir.

45:21.481 --> 45:25.431
That gesture was necessary.
I'm sorry it was so painful for you.

45:26.986 --> 45:30.486
Mr. Aesop is a fine soldier.
It won't happen again.

45:32.033 --> 45:34.868
What happened is what it's all about, Ben.

45:36.788 --> 45:39.243
If it was as simple as that, Amos.

45:40.917 --> 45:43.156
We can take care of our own.

45:43.256 --> 45:45.923
If you can, you waited too long to do it.

45:46.173 --> 45:49.008
All you people, all the way down the line.

45:49.260 --> 45:50.416
"You people"?

45:50.516 --> 45:54.587
I'm not going to thank you for keeping
your word this afternoon at the river.

45:54.687 --> 45:56.426
You were obliged to.

45:57.394 --> 46:00.010
But it wasn't easy, and I respect you for it.

46:00.110 --> 46:04.897
I don't need respect from a man who took
his kin to fight against their own brothers.

46:06.945 --> 46:09.862
I took soldiers to fight for their country.

46:10.615 --> 46:13.525
- You betrayed it.
- What country have I to betray?

46:13.625 --> 46:18.404
I'm fighting for the only country I have left,
and I kill men in a hopeless war for it.

46:18.504 --> 46:22.579
But not men who were my neighbours
and my friends.

46:23.462 --> 46:24.658
Friends.

46:24.758 --> 46:28.338
The best friend you ever had
was the man who got you into West Point.

46:28.467 --> 46:31.584
He was killed with the 2nd Michigan
in Chickamauga last winter.

46:31.684 --> 46:34.301
- Did you know that?
- I knew that, Amos.

46:35.601 --> 46:40.553
You're a would-be cavalier,
an Irish potato farmer with a plumed hat...

46:40.653 --> 46:44.556
fighting for a white-columned
plantation house...

46:44.656 --> 46:46.858
you never had and never will.

46:49.907 --> 46:54.735
How exactly do you see yourself,
Major Dundee?

46:55.580 --> 47:00.491
Have you ever stopped to think why
they made you a jailer instead of a soldier?

47:34.120 --> 47:38.279
<i>December 22, 1864.</i>
<i>We are five weeks into Mexico...</i>

47:38.379 --> 47:41.074
<i>and have lost all contact with the Apache.</i>

47:41.174 --> 47:44.585
<i>Even the scout, Samuel Potts, admits this,</i>
<i>and I'm glad.</i>

47:44.798 --> 47:49.212
<i>I wish to avenge the massacre,</i>
<i>but I remember it too well, and I'm afraid.</i>

47:50.805 --> 47:54.505
<i>How can we catch the wind</i>
<i>or destroy an enemy we never see?</i>

48:01.232 --> 48:04.768
<i>It is Christmas Eve,</i>
<i>the year of our Lord, 1864...</i>

48:04.903 --> 48:09.649
<i>and there is a deep and reverent sense of</i>
<i>peace and tranquillity in the camp tonight.</i>

48:12.077 --> 48:14.527
<i>Mr. Potts and Riago, the Apache...</i>

48:14.627 --> 48:17.403
<i>indulge in a high-spirited,</i>
<i>brotherly bout of wrestling.</i>

48:17.503 --> 48:20.531
<i>At stake is Mr. Potts</i>' <i>gold railroad watch...</i>

48:20.631 --> 48:24.037
<i>and the Apache's shotgun</i>
<i>with the silver inlaid stock.</i>

48:24.137 --> 48:26.124
<i>It is a friendly contest.</i>

48:28.219 --> 48:29.958
Come on, Injun, get up.

48:30.058 --> 48:32.545
There he is over there, go get him!

48:40.274 --> 48:42.516
- That one brought him.
- Get up!

48:51.076 --> 48:55.406
I think he's going to take you, Samuel.
You know why?

48:55.915 --> 48:58.614
Because the artillery's betting on you.

48:58.714 --> 49:01.710
Do you know Lt. Graham's bet $5 on you?

49:03.214 --> 49:05.836
Artillery and a lieutenant, to boot.

49:06.927 --> 49:10.586
Did you ever hear of an artilleryman
winning a bet, or a girl...

49:10.686 --> 49:13.433
or a war when there was cavalry about?

49:13.809 --> 49:17.013
- Who bet against me?
- Me.

49:58.606 --> 50:02.438
- Just one, Major. He wants to talk.
- Bring him in.

50:14.873 --> 50:17.700
He says he's a good Apache,
and he's peaceful...

50:17.800 --> 50:20.081
and for nobody to shoot at him.

50:20.796 --> 50:24.373
- Is he a Chiricahua?
- He surely is.

50:24.473 --> 50:27.338
Why would an old man like that
be raiding with Charriba?

50:33.059 --> 50:36.179
He says, why not? It's their land, all of it.

50:40.942 --> 50:45.101
Now he'd like a little soft food
as his teeth are no longer with us.

50:45.201 --> 50:46.572
Why did he quit?

50:50.160 --> 50:51.868
Charriba kicked him out.

50:54.706 --> 50:58.242
He says he's too old,
much too old to fight anymore.

50:58.461 --> 51:00.869
Ask him why I should believe him.

51:09.097 --> 51:10.097
Well?

51:11.266 --> 51:14.433
He says Charriba's camp is across the river.

51:15.312 --> 51:18.064
He'll lead us there. They'll be asleep.

51:30.036 --> 51:32.444
Does he expect me to believe that?

51:33.623 --> 51:35.948
Let him lead us into an ambush?

51:45.511 --> 51:48.002
He says his heart is true, Major...

51:49.265 --> 51:50.965
and he brings proof.

51:51.065 --> 51:53.216
What kind of proof, Mr. Potts?

51:53.978 --> 51:55.520
The children.

51:57.648 --> 51:59.687
He's brought the children.

52:03.822 --> 52:05.233
Pretty good.

52:19.672 --> 52:21.250
Go on, sing up.

52:24.677 --> 52:26.005
Soup's on.

52:27.805 --> 52:29.589
Here's one for you, shorty.

52:29.689 --> 52:32.132
Come on, buck, get around here
where you can eat.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.302
- Can I have seconds?
- Get in here.

52:35.813 --> 52:38.430
- Don't we get any?
- Watch out, don't spill it.

52:38.530 --> 52:41.935
Don't look to me like them gut-eaters
has been feeding them very good.

52:42.035 --> 52:44.946
- Did you ever see a fat Apache?
- I ain't yet.

52:49.620 --> 52:51.114
This is good.

52:53.916 --> 52:57.831
You're going back now that you've got
what you came for, Major?

53:00.757 --> 53:04.007
Everything points to that old man
talking straight.

53:04.135 --> 53:06.128
Potts is half convinced.

53:06.554 --> 53:08.298
I'm more than half.

53:09.682 --> 53:12.882
Did it ever occur to you
that Charriba gave us what we wanted...

53:12.982 --> 53:15.765
because he intends to take it back again?

53:16.232 --> 53:17.975
It's occurred to me.

53:20.778 --> 53:25.025
I want two of your best men
to help Sgt. Gomez take the children home.

53:29.078 --> 53:31.403
We'll still outnumber you, Amos.

53:32.873 --> 53:36.492
You surely will, Ben.
Now go do as you're told.

53:37.254 --> 53:38.499
Yes, sir.

53:42.092 --> 53:45.840
But only until the Apache is taken
or destroyed.

53:53.563 --> 53:57.683
<i>Sgt. Gomez headed back to safety</i>
<i>with the three Rostes boys...</i>

53:57.783 --> 54:00.895
<i>while we followed the old Apache</i>
<i>toward Sierra Charriba.</i>

54:12.082 --> 54:15.332
Lieutenant,
take 12 men across as skirmishers.

54:15.711 --> 54:17.502
First 12 men, follow me.

55:57.568 --> 56:00.604
- Sergeant Chillum, take them through.
- Yes, sir.

56:39.445 --> 56:41.984
Get them back to the far side of the river!

57:23.033 --> 57:24.825
Back to the river!

57:51.480 --> 57:55.644
- Try and regroup on the far bank!
- Hadley, run them out!

57:57.945 --> 58:02.358
Keep moving, Lieutenant Graham,
there's nobody left to shoot at out here.

58:10.584 --> 58:12.541
Merry Christmas.

58:29.228 --> 58:32.597
He was making a doll for his girl child.
Riago!

58:35.651 --> 58:37.608
How did they know?

58:39.322 --> 58:40.899
They're Apache.

58:45.954 --> 58:47.994
Just what in hell is he?

58:50.167 --> 58:51.910
I'm a tame Apache.

58:52.878 --> 58:54.253
A camp dog.

58:55.213 --> 58:56.873
Christian Indian.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.544
Charriba is Apache.

59:01.679 --> 59:05.807
Sam, you take this camp dog
and go find me Charriba.

59:11.064 --> 59:13.555
That's what you pay us for, Amos.

59:26.622 --> 59:29.706
- Wiley, did you get hit?
- No, sir.

59:29.959 --> 59:32.498
One of them damn mules kicked me.

59:39.719 --> 59:42.419
Fourteen men killed, sir. Thirteen wounded.

59:42.519 --> 59:44.091
Four critically.

59:45.892 --> 59:50.056
70% of all stores lost, 20% ammunition...

59:50.689 --> 59:53.305
and 60% of livestock either killed or stolen.

59:53.405 --> 59:56.235
- Damn it to bloody Confederate hell!
- What?

59:56.903 --> 59:59.021
- Sorry.
- He's all right, Doctor.

59:59.121 --> 01:00:01.231
He'll live forever
and have a hundred children.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.941
But if time and battle prove
that you have a weakness...

01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:08.249
for being shot in that vicinity,
I'd wear an iron board inside my pants.

01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:19.673
You tell him go easy with that, Major,
or I'll shoot you right between the eyes.

01:00:19.886 --> 01:00:24.015
You patrolled this whole area with Grant
in '47, didn't you?

01:00:24.433 --> 01:00:28.051
Yes. The tequila was excellent.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.470
How far would you say we are
from the nearest food and shelter?

01:00:33.191 --> 01:00:37.024
About a week's march. Maybe less.

01:00:38.114 --> 01:00:40.942
There's a pretty village, and rather friendly.

01:00:41.042 --> 01:00:44.028
If you're really serious
about replenishing our supplies...

01:00:44.128 --> 01:00:48.534
there's a well-stocked garrison
I could recommend just about here.

01:00:49.126 --> 01:00:52.958
But we'd probably have to tangle
with some French Lancers.

01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:56.664
That's one thing I plan to avoid.

01:00:56.764 --> 01:00:59.380
Major, we can't follow the Apache.

01:01:00.012 --> 01:01:02.135
I'm not letting go of that Injun.

01:01:02.932 --> 01:01:05.138
- Boy!
- Sir!

01:01:09.146 --> 01:01:12.594
Pass the word to the command
we move out in the morning.

01:01:12.694 --> 01:01:15.694
And bring me a bottle
of that medicinal brandy.

01:01:15.947 --> 01:01:20.194
There is no more brandy, sir,
except at the bottom of the river.

01:01:23.204 --> 01:01:25.909
Now this time, Lieutenant, try and hold still.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.074
Prepare to move out in the morning.

01:01:48.396 --> 01:01:51.066
We left a lot at the bottom of the river.

01:02:04.956 --> 01:02:09.369
We ask thee, Lord, to take these soldiers
who have fallen in thy service.

01:02:09.627 --> 01:02:10.627
Amen.

01:02:43.914 --> 01:02:45.621
We got whipped, Major.

01:02:47.417 --> 01:02:50.537
Burying your dead is not going to change it.

01:03:03.184 --> 01:03:05.675
<i>January 9, 1865.</i>

01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:09.021
<i>Sgt. Gomez and the troopers returned today.</i>

01:03:09.231 --> 01:03:11.471
<i>The Rostes boys are well and safe.</i>

01:03:11.571 --> 01:03:14.142
<i>This made us feel better, but not for long.</i>

01:03:20.244 --> 01:03:22.236
He's not running anymore.

01:03:23.121 --> 01:03:24.580
He's waiting.

01:03:28.293 --> 01:03:30.535
Let's move. Mount up!

01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:09.495
<i>January 10.</i>

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:11.627
<i>Two more died last night.</i>

01:04:12.007 --> 01:04:15.458
<i>I'm afraid all the wounded will perish</i>
<i>unless we rest.</i>

01:04:15.677 --> 01:04:18.594
<i>I wonder whether any of us will ever return.</i>

01:04:19.139 --> 01:04:22.590
<i>The war of rebellion and Fort Benlin</i>
<i>seem very far away.</i>

01:04:34.655 --> 01:04:36.482
The village is occupied.

01:04:37.366 --> 01:04:41.115
The blockhouse, there are 10, 15 men.

01:04:41.914 --> 01:04:43.953
Regulars, I think. I don't know.

01:04:44.124 --> 01:04:46.615
Their garrison is about six hours away...

01:04:47.461 --> 01:04:51.043
and about 300 Lancers,
Legionnaires, or maybe less.

01:04:52.007 --> 01:04:54.415
We'll move on the village at sunup.

01:06:03.791 --> 01:06:07.575
Dismount! Prepare to fight on foot!

01:06:08.462 --> 01:06:11.084
- Horses to the rear.
- Get those horses!

01:06:21.601 --> 01:06:24.768
- Point blank range.
- Fuse timing zero.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:27.972
Unload.

01:06:28.072 --> 01:06:30.350
Locked, loaded and primed,
and ready for firing.

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:32.267
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.

01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:34.237
Boy, whistle me a tune.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:37.067
Will you show the colours, sir?

01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:40.114
No, Lieutenant,
we will not show the colours.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.783
All right, Sam, make it short
and to the point.

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:01.634
Hey, get out here!

01:07:08.026 --> 01:07:12.018
Compliments, Major Amos Dundee,
irregular United States Cavalry.

01:07:12.118 --> 01:07:14.896
You have five minutes to surrender
your arms and stores...

01:07:14.996 --> 01:07:18.277
- or he's going to cut loose.
- He would not dare.

01:07:18.536 --> 01:07:21.652
This is an act of aggression
against a friendly power...

01:07:21.752 --> 01:07:24.702
- an outrageous breach of international law.
- Sonny...

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.833
the Major ain't no lawyer.

01:07:28.713 --> 01:07:30.872
You've now got four minutes.

01:07:43.897 --> 01:07:46.566
Sergeant, I want to talk to the mayor.

01:07:54.241 --> 01:07:57.657
- There seems to be no end to it.
- What did you say?

01:07:57.995 --> 01:08:01.364
We've been attacked by Apaches,
by local bandits...

01:08:01.623 --> 01:08:05.372
by freebooters from Texas,
then liberated by the French...

01:08:05.627 --> 01:08:07.999
and now United States Cavalry.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.079
Unfortunately, you came too late.
We have nothing to give you.

01:08:12.179 --> 01:08:15.842
No food, no guns, no women.

01:08:19.852 --> 01:08:22.058
That is what you want, isn't it?

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:26.274
That's why you come here
without flying your country's brave flag.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:31.224
Are you speaking for these people?
You're not Mexican, are you?

01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:33.688
My husband was the doctor of this village.

01:08:33.787 --> 01:08:36.898
But he was also the doctor for the Juaristas.

01:08:36.997 --> 01:08:40.197
He died there, where they did.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:43.032
I've paid for my place here.

01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:45.953
Well, I'm sorry for that, ma'am,
but we've come a long way.

01:08:46.053 --> 01:08:49.165
I need fresh horses and food.
My men are hungry.

01:08:49.466 --> 01:08:52.135
They are no more hungry than this village.

01:09:01.145 --> 01:09:04.763
They are willing to share everything
they have got with you, Major...

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:07.054
most particularly their hunger.

01:09:07.154 --> 01:09:10.022
Would you like to see the children
in our dispensary...

01:09:10.154 --> 01:09:12.143
whose sickness is starvation?

01:09:12.243 --> 01:09:14.149
- Lieutenant Graham, fire!
- Sir!

01:09:27.089 --> 01:09:30.537
Sgt. Gomez, slaughter two mules,
distribute the meat...

01:09:30.636 --> 01:09:34.582
and whatever stores you find in that
blockhouse to the people of the village...

01:09:34.683 --> 01:09:38.215
- and to this lady.
- Teresa. Teresa Maria Santiago.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.558
- Ma'am. Ryan!
- Yes, sir.

01:09:45.817 --> 01:09:47.274
Lieutenant!

01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:56.202
With beauty such as yours,
this village is rich beyond comparison.

01:09:58.497 --> 01:10:00.288
Lieutenant Tyreen!

01:10:26.694 --> 01:10:28.687
God save the Queen.

01:10:30.114 --> 01:10:33.107
<i>We entered the village</i>
<i>to take food and horses...</i>

01:10:33.207 --> 01:10:36.404
<i>but instead gave away our own,</i>
<i>and everyone was thankful.</i>

01:11:00.771 --> 01:11:03.094
<i>Our wounds were tended</i>
<i>by a German lady...</i>

01:11:03.194 --> 01:11:06.350
<i>who spoke English and was pretty,</i>
<i>if somewhat old.</i>

01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:08.894
- Hold it there, will you?
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:11:08.994 --> 01:11:13.946
<i>Also, a very lovely Mexican girl</i>
<i>who was kindness itself, gentle and young.</i>

01:11:15.453 --> 01:11:17.991
Don't worry, son, it ain't near your heart.

01:11:38.436 --> 01:11:40.892
To the victors belong the spoils.

01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:44.359
Well, Ben, you look quite the gentleman.

01:11:45.151 --> 01:11:47.018
After the war, Amos...

01:11:47.118 --> 01:11:51.192
the Tyreens of County Clair become
the landed gentry of Virginia.

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:54.110
It's not over yet.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:00.496
By midnight tonight I want every man in this
command drunker than a fiddler's bitch.

01:12:01.334 --> 01:12:05.035
At that point, our prisoners will escape
and run for help.

01:12:05.505 --> 01:12:08.460
But we will not discover this until sunup.

01:12:08.676 --> 01:12:11.210
Tomorrow night, after following us all day...

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:15.883
that French cavalry will camp and prepare
to attack our disorganised rabble.

01:12:16.977 --> 01:12:21.555
But before they make their move,
we will steal them blind and be on our way.

01:12:22.357 --> 01:12:24.017
You are either...

01:12:24.443 --> 01:12:28.772
a $70, red-wool, pure-quill military genius...

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:33.359
or the biggest damn fool
in Northern Mexico.

01:12:33.702 --> 01:12:35.362
No question of it.

01:12:41.084 --> 01:12:44.501
You haven't got the temperament
to be a liberator, Amos.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.998
I don't?

01:14:15.376 --> 01:14:19.160
If I may suggest, sirs,
the time has come to join the fiesta.

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:24.462
Sitting alone is bad for the soul.

01:14:47.701 --> 01:14:51.912
Captain Tyreen. Does he shave?

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.367
- Does it matter?
- Didn't to me.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.402
She's not here.

01:15:24.697 --> 01:15:25.895
Too bad.

01:15:26.616 --> 01:15:29.901
There was something about that woman.

01:15:35.124 --> 01:15:37.332
There sure, sure was.

01:15:38.671 --> 01:15:40.414
Made me think of...

01:15:42.341 --> 01:15:43.504
satin.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:47.925
- Soft, white satin.
- Major.

01:15:57.481 --> 01:15:59.141
Excuse me, Major.

01:16:11.454 --> 01:16:12.783
A waltz.

01:16:22.215 --> 01:16:24.089
I'd be delighted, sir.

01:17:02.798 --> 01:17:04.756
- Lieutenant Graham.
- Sir!

01:17:05.551 --> 01:17:09.169
- Why aren't you with the pickets?
- I've been relieved, sir.

01:17:10.723 --> 01:17:11.968
Carry on.

01:17:14.226 --> 01:17:18.884
Sir, in my opinion we need more guards
at the blockhouse...

01:17:18.984 --> 01:17:21.817
or the French prisoners are going to escape.

01:17:23.403 --> 01:17:26.238
Thank you, Lieutenant, for your opinion.

01:17:26.615 --> 01:17:29.070
Now, I trust you will carry on.

01:17:29.785 --> 01:17:33.319
No, sir. You see, I'm cutting in, sir.

01:17:33.538 --> 01:17:35.994
- What?
- Cutting in, sir.

01:17:39.419 --> 01:17:42.337
Lieutenant Graham,
have you been drinking?

01:17:47.052 --> 01:17:49.721
- SeÃ±orita.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:55.015
A Mexican dance, perhaps?

01:19:51.597 --> 01:19:54.847
I wanted to say goodbye, and thank you.

01:19:57.603 --> 01:20:01.268
It was good to celebrate just being alive.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.816
- Are you planning to stay on here now?
- I don't know.

01:20:08.281 --> 01:20:12.195
I met my husband when
he was a medical student in Vienna.

01:20:12.995 --> 01:20:15.320
My family disapproved violently.

01:20:15.914 --> 01:20:19.330
So violently, I no longer have any ties there.

01:20:20.877 --> 01:20:22.669
And I'm needed here.

01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:28.173
There is no one else except for Linda,
not for a hundred miles.

01:20:32.097 --> 01:20:35.217
You will say goodbye to Lt. Tyreen for me?

01:20:38.395 --> 01:20:40.103
I'd be delighted.

01:20:41.273 --> 01:20:44.183
I liked the way he asked me to dance.

01:20:44.283 --> 01:20:47.147
As if we were in a ballroom in Vienna.

01:20:48.197 --> 01:20:52.409
- It was a lovely little charade.
- The Lieutenant has style.

01:20:53.911 --> 01:20:56.663
He must be a fanciful man.

01:20:57.915 --> 01:21:02.293
He is corrupt. But I will save him.

01:21:26.236 --> 01:21:28.229
Thank you for being kind.

01:21:30.366 --> 01:21:32.275
All I feel is kindness.

01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:37.820
Next time I'll be more fanciful.

01:21:47.424 --> 01:21:50.628
Hadley! Wiley! Get them mules in here.

01:22:00.689 --> 01:22:03.892
Mount up. Just fall in. Get in there.

01:22:04.359 --> 01:22:08.226
Ryan is missing, sir.
Graham went to look for him.

01:22:08.905 --> 01:22:12.191
- Who went to look for Graham?
- Gomez.

01:22:22.627 --> 01:22:25.498
Sergeant Gomez,
be gentle with the bugler boy.

01:22:26.089 --> 01:22:27.334
He's ill.

01:22:28.717 --> 01:22:31.884
Take your time, Trooper Ryan,
take your time.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.932
We're delighted you decided to join us.

01:22:36.976 --> 01:22:40.053
Now if you'd only warned us,
we could have sent Sgt. Gomez...

01:22:40.153 --> 01:22:42.352
to serve you breakfast in bed.

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.579
Ryan, put it in the saddle!

01:23:13.972 --> 01:23:15.881
All accounted and <i>...</i>

01:23:16.433 --> 01:23:19.299
All present and accounted for, sir.

01:23:19.399 --> 01:23:22.598
I can see that, Lieutenant Graham.
I can clearly see that.

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:26.932
Suppose you could manage
to move them out now?

01:23:27.032 --> 01:23:29.779
Twos left, right turn.

01:24:36.015 --> 01:24:38.925
<i>Last night the Major let</i>
<i>the French prisoners escape.</i>

01:24:39.025 --> 01:24:42.011
<i>He hoped they would go to</i>
<i>their garrison for reinforcements.</i>

01:24:42.111 --> 01:24:43.349
<i>They did.</i>

01:24:43.564 --> 01:24:47.348
<i>This afternoon he sent Lt. Graham</i>
<i>and some troopers out as a decoy.</i>

01:24:47.651 --> 01:24:49.475
<i>The rest of us hung back, waiting.</i>

01:24:49.575 --> 01:24:52.564
Jefferson, that scarf is
to decorate the cannon, not you.

01:24:52.664 --> 01:24:54.857
- Yes, sir.
- Wiley, secure those pack animals.

01:24:54.957 --> 01:24:57.442
Sergeant Chillum, are the pickets out?

01:24:57.954 --> 01:25:00.576
They're out. Not that they'll do any good.

01:25:01.207 --> 01:25:03.959
If them Lancers has got a fieldpiece...

01:25:04.544 --> 01:25:08.370
they could move it in,
lay in one round, and then finish us off...

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.216
with them 10-foot frog stickers
they're packing.

01:25:13.428 --> 01:25:14.623
No, they'll camp.

01:25:14.723 --> 01:25:18.386
Begging your pardon, Lieutenant,
but who says so?

01:25:20.185 --> 01:25:21.185
I do.

01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:07.147
Don't they look pretty?

01:26:11.321 --> 01:26:15.070
My boys can take that outfit,
the walking ones anyway...

01:26:15.951 --> 01:26:18.489
with one hand tied behind our backs.

01:26:19.621 --> 01:26:21.360
How's that, Aesop?

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.374
They're soft, O.W.
They ain't never been south.

01:26:32.969 --> 01:26:34.796
They're closing up.

01:26:35.013 --> 01:26:38.678
They'll be less than five miles
from Graham by full dark.

01:26:39.142 --> 01:26:41.214
What if they don't stop?

01:26:41.314 --> 01:26:45.474
What if they don't camp? They just keep on,
smash hell out of the Lieutenant?

01:27:51.716 --> 01:27:53.424
Mighty is the arm of the Lord.

01:28:27.044 --> 01:28:31.081
<i>January 15. It took the French</i>
<i>three days to discover...</i>

01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:34.756
<i>all they were chasing was</i>
<i>a one-armed scout and a renegade Apache.</i>

01:28:35.052 --> 01:28:38.001
<i>By that time, Mr. Potts and Riago</i>
<i>figured we were safe...</i>

01:28:38.101 --> 01:28:40.713
<i>and decided to lose them and find us.</i>

01:28:40.813 --> 01:28:43.133
<i>We rested and healed our wounds.</i>

01:29:03.915 --> 01:29:06.122
Hey! I'm drowning!

01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:09.497
- Come on in.
- I already had my bath.

01:29:10.130 --> 01:29:11.873
Hey, the water's fine.

01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:17.883
- First shave, Tim?
- Yep.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:21.681
- Maybe we should call you Ryan now.
- Yeah.

01:29:36.783 --> 01:29:39.232
<i>We are waiting for Mr. Potts, Sgt. Gomez...</i>

01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:42.197
<i>and the rebel captain to return</i>
<i>from the scout.</i>

01:29:42.372 --> 01:29:45.865
<i>We fear that the French have taken</i>
<i>reprisals against the village.</i>

01:29:45.965 --> 01:29:48.530
<i>I keep thinking about Linda</i>
<i>and pray for her safety.</i>

01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:51.415
- What happened?
- Just like watching a bird die.

01:29:51.673 --> 01:29:53.955
- And the woman?
- I don't know, Amos.

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:56.372
If they hanged her, they cut her down.

01:29:56.472 --> 01:30:00.046
Them boys in the pretty hats
make the Apache look like missionaries.

01:30:00.146 --> 01:30:03.256
Never underestimate the value
of a European education.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:06.519
- No sign of Charriba?
- Don't worry about that, Amos.

01:30:06.689 --> 01:30:08.639
He wants to drag it out.

01:30:08.739 --> 01:30:12.059
I think he figures on leaving stories
about you that'll be told...

01:30:12.159 --> 01:30:15.438
around the campfires of his people
for a thousand years.

01:30:27.084 --> 01:30:29.828
<i>We were healing,</i>
<i>becoming a command again.</i>

01:30:29.928 --> 01:30:32.286
<i>Hard and watchful, anxious for battle...</i>

01:30:32.386 --> 01:30:35.253
<i>when that which</i>
<i>the Major hated most occurred.</i>

01:30:37.304 --> 01:30:39.261
Sir! A deserter.

01:30:41.808 --> 01:30:45.343
O.W. Hadley has deserted, sir. Last night.

01:30:46.021 --> 01:30:49.686
A horse is gone,
food and ammunition supplies broken into.

01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:58.115
Mr. Potts, you take Riago
and pick up his trail.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.074
I want that man back.

01:31:02.579 --> 01:31:04.488
It ain't my job, Major.

01:31:06.291 --> 01:31:10.159
I didn't sign on to go chasing
after no homesick soldier boys.

01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:12.458
It's mine.

01:31:23.142 --> 01:31:26.060
All right, Sergeant, you find him.

01:31:32.068 --> 01:31:34.184
Beg your pardon, sir...

01:31:34.284 --> 01:31:37.438
but what'll they do to Pvt. Hadley
when they catch him?

01:31:37.538 --> 01:31:38.538
What?

01:31:39.867 --> 01:31:42.786
Son, it'd be our good luck if he killed him.

01:31:43.038 --> 01:31:45.446
But he won't and the Major will.

01:31:45.791 --> 01:31:47.582
Oh, no, Mr. Potts...

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:50.626
the Major will not.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:31.626
<i>In two days,</i>
<i>Sgt. Gomez returned with O. W. Hadley.</i>

01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:36.417
<i>Along the way he found the lady doctor</i>
<i>with some children and Linda.</i>

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:39.334
<i>They had all fled the village.</i>

01:32:39.434 --> 01:32:43.129
<i>The Major wasted no time</i>
<i>trying O. W. Hadley for desertion.</i>

01:32:43.308 --> 01:32:47.969
Boys, by doggies, I want you to know
what kind of company we've been keeping.

01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:52.436
He just plain clean shot a hole in me.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.599
And he would have let me bleed to death...

01:32:55.699 --> 01:32:59.694
if it hadn't been for that woman over there
come along and bandaged up my leg.

01:33:02.036 --> 01:33:04.408
Now, you know I ain't no deserter.

01:33:05.164 --> 01:33:09.660
I just went into that village to court
a little seÃ±orita and say hello to her folks.

01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:13.577
I was fixing to come back. I was.

01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:17.591
You all know I always stay close
to my big brother.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.126
- Ain't that right, Arthur?
- That's right.

01:33:20.226 --> 01:33:24.085
And you ain't gonna let them shoot your kin
for no deserter, are you, Arthur?

01:33:24.185 --> 01:33:26.805
You gonna do something about it,
ain't you?

01:33:28.605 --> 01:33:31.310
Sergeant, I don't want to look up at him.

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.285
Captain.

01:33:55.674 --> 01:33:57.251
You know me.

01:33:58.927 --> 01:34:01.170
I've been over the hill before.

01:34:03.224 --> 01:34:05.715
But I always come back, didn't I?

01:34:07.979 --> 01:34:10.979
And you whipped me for it
and I deserved it.

01:34:13.609 --> 01:34:15.851
But you never killed me none.

01:34:17.196 --> 01:34:20.523
Now you ain't gonna hand me over
to no bluebelly...

01:34:20.623 --> 01:34:23.238
just because I had a hankering
for a woman?

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:32.038
She's a sweet little thing, Captain.

01:34:32.336 --> 01:34:36.038
She's pretty and polite and a lady.
She surely is.

01:34:36.758 --> 01:34:39.214
And that grub is for her kinfolks.

01:34:42.639 --> 01:34:44.133
You remember her, Captain?

01:34:44.266 --> 01:34:48.258
I was dancing with her and I introduced you
to her. You remember her, don't you?

01:34:48.358 --> 01:34:49.381
I remember.

01:34:49.481 --> 01:34:53.260
Sergeant Chillum, would you say it was
common knowledge in this camp that...

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.443
that village had been burned,
people scattered?

01:35:06.455 --> 01:35:08.822
Well, I know that, Major, sir...

01:35:08.922 --> 01:35:11.993
but I just figured I'd sit there
and wait till they come back.

01:35:12.093 --> 01:35:13.960
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

01:35:14.088 --> 01:35:17.125
How much food and ammunition
would you say was taken?

01:35:18.176 --> 01:35:20.749
Enough for three men for a week, sir.

01:35:22.513 --> 01:35:25.550
Look, Major, forget about the book.

01:35:25.933 --> 01:35:29.343
The men of this command risked their lives
for those supplies.

01:35:29.443 --> 01:35:33.102
It may have slipped your mind,
but he also risked his life.

01:35:35.068 --> 01:35:36.443
Trooper...

01:35:37.987 --> 01:35:39.896
you're gonna be shot.

01:35:40.907 --> 01:35:42.152
Hadley!

01:35:47.206 --> 01:35:50.456
Major, hand him over to us.
I'll deal with him.

01:35:53.921 --> 01:35:55.743
I'm not going to let you kill him.

01:35:55.843 --> 01:35:58.622
You used to be a soldier.
Do you know what you're saying?

01:35:58.722 --> 01:36:02.754
I'm saying if you kill that boy
that's the beginning of it and not the end.

01:36:02.854 --> 01:36:04.419
You're wearing out, Ben.

01:36:04.519 --> 01:36:08.133
You were a rock once,
now you're crumbling like old chalk.

01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:13.896
Lieutenant, select a firing squad by lot.

01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:17.189
- Exclude the Confederates.
- Yes, sir.

01:36:20.448 --> 01:36:24.031
I said we will serve in this command
and we will serve!

01:36:25.453 --> 01:36:28.324
But only until we have caught the Apache.

01:36:32.836 --> 01:36:34.579
And then, Major...

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.296
I am going to kill you.

01:36:41.136 --> 01:36:42.678
Are you, Ben?

01:36:46.057 --> 01:36:47.057
Yes.

01:36:50.145 --> 01:36:51.688
Yes, Amos.

01:37:05.161 --> 01:37:07.734
You gonna let them shoot me, Captain?

01:37:11.208 --> 01:37:13.082
I'm obliged to, son.

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:17.960
You should have remembered
you belong to the Major and not to me.

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:26.634
I'm sorry.

01:37:42.991 --> 01:37:45.363
That's it, boys, by doggies...

01:37:46.995 --> 01:37:49.665
let's pitch in and get it over with.

01:37:55.796 --> 01:37:59.544
Hell, Major, you're just doing
what you got to do...

01:38:00.635 --> 01:38:04.467
but damn your soul for it,
and God bless Robert E. Lee.

01:38:57.693 --> 01:39:02.818
<i>We are a command divided against itself,</i>
<i>and I fear nothing will ever heal this breach.</i>

01:39:04.408 --> 01:39:07.690
<i>Even some of our own people</i>
<i>are bitter against the Major.</i>

01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:12.248
<i>But he bears the burden of command</i>
<i>and I do not feel fit to judge him.</i>

01:39:50.414 --> 01:39:52.621
I'm not one of your soldiers.

01:39:54.877 --> 01:39:59.705
I could not bear to be with all those men,
in the midst of all that hatred.

01:40:05.012 --> 01:40:08.097
- May I walk with you?
- Not afraid of the tiger?

01:40:08.933 --> 01:40:12.931
Are you the tiger
that prowls these mountains?

01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:19.108
No, I'm not afraid, Major.

01:40:30.122 --> 01:40:32.957
- Oh, it's lovely here.
- I don't spoil it?

01:40:33.875 --> 01:40:34.875
No.

01:40:50.809 --> 01:40:53.764
What happened today was terrible.

01:40:55.273 --> 01:40:57.645
We all died a little with that boy.

01:40:59.027 --> 01:41:01.648
But perhaps you, most of all.

01:41:06.951 --> 01:41:08.778
Why are you with me?

01:41:15.877 --> 01:41:18.284
I've seen too much dying...

01:41:22.383 --> 01:41:25.301
and I wanted so desperately to feel alive...

01:41:27.221 --> 01:41:29.760
for both of us to feel alive.

01:42:17.732 --> 01:42:21.944
It troubles you a great deal, doesn't it,
how the men feel about you?

01:42:22.153 --> 01:42:25.937
I'm concerned with how they fight,
not how they feel about me.

01:42:26.074 --> 01:42:29.028
But why is this so important, this fighting?

01:42:30.829 --> 01:42:32.868
There are other things.

01:42:33.832 --> 01:42:37.996
Men can understand fighting.
I guess maybe they need it sometimes.

01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:40.622
The truth is, it's easy.

01:42:40.881 --> 01:42:43.966
Forget about your problems,
responsibilities...

01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:48.175
just let someone feed you,
tell you what to do.

01:42:48.556 --> 01:42:50.595
But whom do you answer to?

01:43:01.902 --> 01:43:05.770
If you go to Durango you'll have to go
into hiding, won't you?

01:43:07.575 --> 01:43:10.410
It will be difficult, but not impossible.

01:43:13.415 --> 01:43:17.080
Did you ever think
about living in the United States?

01:43:19.838 --> 01:43:21.831
I don't think about that, Major.

01:43:46.616 --> 01:43:48.276
Get it out.

01:43:48.701 --> 01:43:52.070
I can't. It's too deep.
It's too close to the artery.

01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:55.285
They have to take you
to the doctor in Durango.

01:43:55.583 --> 01:43:57.822
I'm staying with the command.

01:43:57.922 --> 01:44:01.169
You get me some whiskey and bandages.
Go on.

01:44:05.885 --> 01:44:08.423
Sergeant, get a stretcher for the Major.

01:44:13.101 --> 01:44:15.473
You're getting leave, Major.

01:44:22.111 --> 01:44:24.103
And it's time you did.

01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:27.978
In fact,
you ought to give up soldiering altogether.

01:44:28.078 --> 01:44:31.693
You were trapped at the river.
Ambushed like a shavetail.

01:44:32.121 --> 01:44:35.739
You caused a boy's death
and you've split your own command.

01:44:37.459 --> 01:44:40.575
And now how do you explain
being outside your own picket lines?

01:44:40.675 --> 01:44:44.203
What are you doing, Major, easing
your conscience in the arms of a woman?

01:44:44.303 --> 01:44:47.751
A woman, if I might say so,
of rather doubtful virtue.

01:44:54.102 --> 01:44:58.396
Just what the bloody hell are you
doing here in the first place, Amos?

01:45:04.571 --> 01:45:07.572
There are so many French soldiers
in Durango.

01:45:09.951 --> 01:45:11.944
We won't show the colours.

01:45:21.129 --> 01:45:24.794
- I can't speak the language.
- But you understand.

01:45:29.138 --> 01:45:30.301
Major.

01:46:09.137 --> 01:46:11.759
It is close, very close.

01:46:13.058 --> 01:46:16.723
If you're thinking
of cutting that leg off, Doctor, don't.

01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:27.981
I am only concerned
to stop the loss of blood.

01:46:31.159 --> 01:46:33.733
Though much of it is alcohol.

01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:41.118
You should be able to walk
in seven days and ride in twelve.

01:46:41.218 --> 01:46:43.534
I'll walk in two and ride in one more.

01:46:43.634 --> 01:46:47.380
Mr. Potts, you and Sgt. Gomez
can rejoin the command now.

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:50.547
I can get to the river camp by myself.

01:46:54.017 --> 01:46:57.884
And I'm perfectly capable
of following your trail from there.

01:46:59.230 --> 01:47:01.930
Well, you'd better stay
off those streets, Amos.

01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:03.982
You make an unlikely-looking Mexican.

01:47:24.214 --> 01:47:26.836
No, it's no use.

01:47:27.301 --> 01:47:30.136
They're on to me, those Frenchman.

01:47:31.013 --> 01:47:34.678
Just waiting for me to run,
lead them back to the command.

01:49:04.192 --> 01:49:07.110
I see our French friends are still waiting.

01:49:15.329 --> 01:49:18.080
The tequila. Did you bring the tequila?

01:49:24.338 --> 01:49:27.956
I asked for something to drink.
This isn't enough to spit.

01:49:48.237 --> 01:49:49.237
No.

01:49:58.373 --> 01:50:02.750
Sure, it gets better every day.

01:50:04.254 --> 01:50:06.461
Be able to dance on it soon.

01:50:08.008 --> 01:50:09.965
You don't believe me?

01:50:12.221 --> 01:50:14.130
I'll show you. Come on.

01:50:18.185 --> 01:50:23.143
Miss Covington, I believe I have
the honour of this next quadrille.

01:50:40.208 --> 01:50:41.833
You wait and see.

01:50:57.976 --> 01:51:00.467
This army doesn't dance...

01:51:00.979 --> 01:51:03.933
doesn't march, doesn't fight.

01:51:10.989 --> 01:51:13.397
Except on this last battlefield.

01:51:47.861 --> 01:51:50.566
We're joining the Juaristas at Guaymas.

01:51:57.371 --> 01:52:01.203
I came here to reassure myself
that you were still alive.

01:52:03.377 --> 01:52:04.835
I'm alive.

01:52:07.798 --> 01:52:09.173
Yes, I see.

01:52:32.699 --> 01:52:34.572
You should be careful.

01:52:34.742 --> 01:52:37.442
The French police is already suspicious
of this place.

01:52:37.542 --> 01:52:38.542
Wait.

01:52:43.334 --> 01:52:45.706
If I ever do get out of here <i>...</i>

01:52:49.215 --> 01:52:51.338
The war won't last forever.

01:52:55.263 --> 01:52:57.091
It will for you, Major.

01:53:25.794 --> 01:53:29.044
No, the war will not last forever.

01:53:51.571 --> 01:53:54.481
"Awake! For Morning in the Bowl of Night

01:53:54.581 --> 01:53:58.524
"Has cast the Stone
that puts the Stars to Flight"

01:54:04.292 --> 01:54:07.627
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to rescue you.

01:54:08.506 --> 01:54:11.079
We spent all night looking for you.

01:54:11.342 --> 01:54:14.378
- Why?
- So I can kill you myself.

01:54:16.847 --> 01:54:18.390
Makes sense.

01:54:31.195 --> 01:54:33.864
Well, there goes our little watchdog.

01:54:36.534 --> 01:54:38.242
Shall we go, Major?

01:54:39.662 --> 01:54:42.070
I drink, Ben. Did you know that?

01:54:43.083 --> 01:54:47.579
That is the secret of my great success.
I drink.

01:54:52.384 --> 01:54:54.377
But I don't drink enough.

01:54:55.595 --> 01:54:58.133
Why don't you drink, Lieutenant Tyreen?

01:54:58.432 --> 01:55:01.464
Don't you ever have any doubts
about who you are?

01:55:01.564 --> 01:55:03.967
I've been three men already, Amos.

01:55:05.022 --> 01:55:07.560
That's enough for one lifetime.

01:55:07.774 --> 01:55:11.143
- Irish immigrant...
- Cashiered American officer.

01:55:12.029 --> 01:55:14.068
And Confederate renegade.

01:55:15.366 --> 01:55:19.446
- I don't like any of them.
- Well, now, isn't that a coincidence.

01:55:21.414 --> 01:55:23.070
Get away from me.

01:55:23.170 --> 01:55:26.115
I have orders, appropriate to your character.

01:55:26.215 --> 01:55:29.211
I have to take you out the back door.

01:55:42.977 --> 01:55:45.677
- Finish it.
- The patrol. We leave now.

01:55:45.777 --> 01:55:47.222
Leave me alone, all of you.

01:55:47.322 --> 01:55:48.916
Company!

01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:51.402
Sergeant Gomez.

01:55:54.531 --> 01:55:55.731
Major.

01:56:05.501 --> 01:56:06.501
Fire!

01:56:08.045 --> 01:56:10.999
Lt. Graham will be a general before he's 30.

01:56:27.232 --> 01:56:29.639
Why, come on, get out of it!

01:56:29.985 --> 01:56:33.235
- Come on!
- Ben, for God's sakes, let me be.

01:56:34.739 --> 01:56:36.281
Why not, Major?

01:56:37.617 --> 01:56:39.989
You're not worth killing anyway.

01:57:15.656 --> 01:57:18.657
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed.

01:57:27.418 --> 01:57:31.455
<i>January 30. We thought we had lost</i>
<i>three troopers in Durango...</i>

01:57:31.555 --> 01:57:34.747
<i>but two returned this morning,</i>
<i>and we became a command again.</i>

01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:38.129
- Lieutenant Graham!
- Yes, sir.

01:57:39.181 --> 01:57:43.173
When I left I gave you a specific order.
You failed to carry it out.

01:57:43.273 --> 01:57:45.593
No, sir. You gave me a command.

01:57:46.063 --> 01:57:48.435
From then on I gave the orders.

01:57:50.067 --> 01:57:53.068
You surely did. Have a cigar.

01:57:55.489 --> 01:57:57.280
Move them out, Lieutenant.

01:57:59.743 --> 01:58:02.820
<i>We ran from the French</i>
<i>as we followed the Apache...</i>

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.901
<i>but time was running out.</i>

01:58:05.001 --> 01:58:09.211
<i>The French patrols became thicker</i>
<i>while we never got closer to Sierra Charriba.</i>

01:58:22.016 --> 01:58:25.551
- How long ago?
- Four or five hours ago.

01:58:25.978 --> 01:58:30.107
Charriba says you're to make
your peace with your Christian God...

01:58:30.733 --> 01:58:32.972
as you are about to join him.

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:37.017
We must have hurt the old man
at the river more than we figured.

01:58:37.117 --> 01:58:39.606
At least now he's got to finish it.

01:58:41.912 --> 01:58:44.403
So far, he's been circling west.

01:58:47.042 --> 01:58:51.206
Some time in the next week or two
he'll hit us again in a canyon...

01:58:52.256 --> 01:58:55.257
or the middle of a river at night, or dawn.

01:58:55.801 --> 01:58:59.751
When are we going to stop fighting
this Indian on his own terms?

01:59:00.931 --> 01:59:02.298
Right now.

01:59:02.398 --> 01:59:06.339
From this point on we tuck our tail between
our legs and run for home...

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:09.802
- straight for the Rio Grande.
- You'd let Charriba escape?

01:59:09.902 --> 01:59:12.931
Let's just say I'm giving him
an equal opportunity, Lieutenant.

01:59:13.031 --> 01:59:15.099
Major, but we have to make it look good.

01:59:15.199 --> 01:59:18.645
First swing right, then head for the river.
But we really got to move.

01:59:18.745 --> 01:59:21.818
If we don't, he'll be waiting for us there,
just like he is now.

01:59:21.918 --> 01:59:25.031
- How'll we know?
- We won't, until it happens.

01:59:25.373 --> 01:59:28.078
On your horse, Lieutenant, move them out.

01:59:31.338 --> 01:59:34.671
- Go cut him down, Sam.
- You cut him down, Major.

01:59:37.677 --> 01:59:39.551
I think he's earned it.

01:59:50.358 --> 01:59:54.936
<i>March 23. Today we learned</i>
<i>that Riago had been a true soldier.</i>

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:59.272
<i>I bitterly regret my suspicions,</i>
<i>as I'm sure does the Major.</i>

02:00:36.405 --> 02:00:40.813
<i>April 18. We ran from the Apaches</i>
<i>and the French...</i>

02:00:40.913 --> 02:00:43.858
<i>then circled and headed</i>
<i>for the river and home.</i>

02:00:43.958 --> 02:00:47.287
<i>The men were angry,</i>
<i>wanting to continue our pursuit.</i>

02:00:47.624 --> 02:00:51.156
<i>And then suddenly we all knew</i>
<i>we weren't running away from anything.</i>

02:00:51.256 --> 02:00:53.826
<i>We were running toward</i>
<i>the end of our search.</i>

02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:57.378
River's less than a mile from here.

02:00:58.468 --> 02:01:00.795
This is your last chance, Major.

02:01:01.055 --> 02:01:04.004
It's as good a place as any
to do what you got in mind.

02:01:04.104 --> 02:01:06.716
Sergeant, if you put your pickets out
far enough...

02:01:06.816 --> 02:01:08.467
the Apache might leave them alone.

02:01:08.567 --> 02:01:12.347
But no matter what happens,
don't fire unless you're attacked.

02:01:12.692 --> 02:01:15.361
Just remember your orders and hope.

02:01:21.951 --> 02:01:23.778
Good luck, Mr. Potts.

02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:28.987
Who will you send against me now?

02:03:38.592 --> 02:03:39.592
Fire.

02:04:34.191 --> 02:04:36.148
He looks so small now.

02:04:37.778 --> 02:04:39.687
He was big enough, son.

02:04:54.294 --> 02:04:56.002
Now, Major...

02:04:58.007 --> 02:05:00.296
or across the river in Texas?

02:05:01.636 --> 02:05:03.795
Right now is just fine, Ben.

02:05:06.516 --> 02:05:09.683
You boys want a fight, I got one for you.

02:05:11.771 --> 02:05:13.645
Get up here and look.

02:05:22.073 --> 02:05:25.988
<i>We had forgotten the French,</i>
<i>but the French had not forgotten us.</i>

02:05:31.124 --> 02:05:33.612
Where can we ford the river into Texas?

02:05:33.712 --> 02:05:37.922
It's the only shallow spot within
a half day's march from here, Major.

02:05:39.467 --> 02:05:43.085
Mount up the troop, Lieutenant,
we're going back home.

02:05:43.554 --> 02:05:44.832
- Sergeant Gomez!
- Sir?

02:05:44.932 --> 02:05:47.801
- Mount the troops, we're moving out now!
- Yes, sir.

02:06:15.545 --> 02:06:17.451
Congratulations, Major.

02:06:17.551 --> 02:06:20.751
It appears that at last
you have found yourself a real war.

02:06:20.926 --> 02:06:22.165
- Sergeant Gomez.
- Sir?

02:06:22.265 --> 02:06:23.961
Dismount and deploy your men...

02:06:24.061 --> 02:06:27.297
prepare to receive a mounted cavalry charge
from your front.

02:06:27.397 --> 02:06:30.051
They won't charge, Major. Why should they?

02:06:30.151 --> 02:06:33.595
By holding their positions,
they hold us here for the others.

02:06:33.855 --> 02:06:36.599
- We have to move against them.
- When I'm ready.

02:06:36.699 --> 02:06:38.181
- Lieutenant Graham.
- Sir?

02:06:38.281 --> 02:06:40.143
- Make ready your artillery.
- Yes, sir.

02:06:40.243 --> 02:06:41.771
- It's ready, sir.
- Simon.

02:06:41.871 --> 02:06:43.436
Break out the ammunition...

02:06:43.537 --> 02:06:45.815
we're about ready
to engage the pride of Europe.

02:06:45.915 --> 02:06:47.155
Yes, sir.

02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:50.153
- Well, Ben?
- I'll need five men mounted.

02:06:50.253 --> 02:06:52.697
I'll hit their flank
after you break their charge.

02:06:52.797 --> 02:06:54.785
- Bully.
- Bully.

02:07:00.258 --> 02:07:02.583
Lieutenant, show the colours.

02:07:03.177 --> 02:07:05.051
- Standard-bearer!
- Sir?

02:07:05.722 --> 02:07:07.382
Show the colours.

02:07:09.434 --> 02:07:11.557
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir!

02:07:12.603 --> 02:07:16.103
Cut the fuse for 500 yards. Elevation 20 <i>...</i>

02:07:16.482 --> 02:07:19.568
- Make that 28 degrees.
- Ready, sir!

02:07:20.529 --> 02:07:22.320
Start the ball, Lieutenant.

02:07:32.416 --> 02:07:34.159
A mile, maybe less.

02:07:45.429 --> 02:07:47.338
They'll be coming now.

02:07:50.225 --> 02:07:52.176
- Sergeant Gomez.
- Sir?

02:07:52.276 --> 02:07:55.846
- The bugle will be your signal to fire.
- Yes, sir.

02:07:55.946 --> 02:07:58.431
Company, charge!

02:08:07.869 --> 02:08:10.357
Any of you damn gringos fire
before the signal...

02:08:10.457 --> 02:08:12.115
I swear to God I kill you.

02:08:16.294 --> 02:08:19.995
On my signal, the horses.
I repeat, only the horses.

02:08:31.769 --> 02:08:33.220
Mount your men.

02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:36.099
Take up a skirmish line
at the foot of the bluff.

02:08:40.403 --> 02:08:44.021
Here comes the second wave, Ben.
We're ready when you are.

02:10:04.864 --> 02:10:06.738
Rally around me!

02:10:16.335 --> 02:10:19.162
Major, I shall see you in Texas.

02:10:19.262 --> 02:10:22.090
You're damn right you will. Bugler!

02:11:31.537 --> 02:11:32.937
Dundee!

02:12:57.542 --> 02:12:59.914
All present and accounted for, sir.

02:13:01.671 --> 02:13:03.083
Your orders, sir.

02:13:05.509 --> 02:13:08.291
Move them out, Lieutenant, column of twos.

02:13:08.391 --> 02:13:09.715
Column of twos.

02:13:19.690 --> 02:13:22.228
- Trooper Ryan!
- Sir.

02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:27.905
- Play us a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.

02:13:28.115 --> 02:13:30.515
Forward, ho!

02:13:30.743 --> 02:13:33.316
<i>April 19, 1865.</i>

02:13:33.662 --> 02:13:36.865
<i>After a brief but costly battle</i>
<i>with French irregulars...</i>

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.832
<i>we crossed the Rio Grande</i>
<i>and re-entered the United States.</i>
