09:06.333 --> 09:08.400
-OKAY,
BEFORE WE GO ANYWHERE ELSE

09:08.500 --> 09:09.933
I'M JUST GONNA
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS.
-ALL RIGHT.

09:10.067 --> 09:12.200
-YOU'RE GONNA SIT IN THE BACK--
I GOT MONEY IN MY POCKETS.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.300
-WE'LL SECURE ALL THAT.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.733
-OKAY, WE'RE GONNA SECURE
ALL THAT FOR YOU.

09:14.833 --> 09:17.567
-I DIDN'T DO A DAMN THING.
I DIDN'T RUN FROM YOU,

09:17.667 --> 09:19.600
DID I?
-NO, AND WE APPRECIATE
YOUR COOPERATION, MAN.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.733
-I WENT TO MY SISTER'S,
-YEAH.

09:21.833 --> 09:25.333
-CAUSE HE'S BEEN-- RIGHT THERE--
AND HE'S AN ASS (bleep).

09:25.433 --> 09:27.067
ALL RIGHT?
-ALL RIGHT.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.933
ALL RIGHT.
-WE'RE GONNA
SORT IT ALL OUT, OKAY?

09:29.067 --> 09:30.867
-CAN YOU PUT MY POCKETS
BACK IN PLEASE?

09:30.967 --> 09:32.867
-YEAH, IN A MINUTE.
JUST GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SEAT.

09:32.967 --> 09:34.200
-ALL RIGHT.

09:34.300 --> 09:37.067
SO, FROM BEGINNING TO END,
TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.900
-LIKE, MY PARENTS HERE...

09:39.067 --> 09:41.967
HE WAS SITTING THERE ARGUING,
SCREAMING AT MY DAD AND MY MOM.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.733
-OKAY.
-MY MOM AND...
AND HE'S BEEN DRINKING,

09:43.833 --> 09:46.067
AND MY MOM AND THEM
TOLD HIM, "JUST GO IN
YOUR ROOM ON YOUR OWN."

09:46.100 --> 09:47.767
MY MOM'S GOT STAGE ONE CANCER.
-OKAY.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.333
WAS HE-- WHY EXACTLY--
WHAT MADE HIM AGITATED?

09:50.433 --> 09:52.133
-BECAUSE THEY WERE
ARGUING AND SCREAMING--

09:52.233 --> 09:54.500
-OVER WHAT THOUGH?
WHAT WERE THEY ARGUING ABOUT?

09:54.600 --> 09:56.700
-THEY ALWAYS ARGUING.
-OKAY.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.767
ALL RIGHT.
-I MEAN, BECAUSE,
ESPECIALLY THIS.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.600
-WHEN YOU SAID,
YOU GUYS TOLD THE DISPATCHER

10:00.700 --> 10:02.300
THAT HE WAS
POSSIBLY INTOXICATED

10:02.400 --> 10:04.700
-HE IS INTOXICATED. YES.
-HE'S BEEN DRINKING? OKAY.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.033
-HE SAID, "YEAH, THAT
PUNK ASS KID OUT THERE

10:07.133 --> 10:08.333
"NEEDS TO GO
DO SOMETHING."

10:08.433 --> 10:10.300
-AND WHO IS THAT "KID"
IN REFERENCE TO?
-ME.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.367
HE WAS SAYING
THAT I'M THE PUNK ASS KID.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.267
-AND THAT'S YOUR BROTHER?
-THAT'S MY BROTHER.

10:14.367 --> 10:16.600
SEE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
THREATENING ME. I'M ON PAROLE.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.067
I JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON
LAST YEAR.

10:18.167 --> 10:19.633
-SO YOU'RE CAREFUL
ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
-YEAH.

10:19.733 --> 10:21.167
AND HE'S BEEN THREATENING ME
SINCE I GOT HERE,

10:21.267 --> 10:22.633
BUT I DIDN'T
CALL THE POLICE UNTIL WHEN HE--

10:22.733 --> 10:24.500
I'M SITTING ON THE CHAIR
WATCHING T.V.,

10:24.600 --> 10:25.967
HE PULLS OUT THE DAMN KNIFE.

10:26.067 --> 10:27.467
-AND WHAT DID HE SAY
WITH THAT KNIFE?

10:27.567 --> 10:29.933
-HE SAID, "I'M GONNA KILL
THAT PUNK ASS MOTHER (bleep)."

10:30.033 --> 10:31.933
-AND HE SAID THAT
TOWARD OR RIGHT AT YOU?
-YEAH. AT ME.

10:32.033 --> 10:33.667
I TOLD MY MA,
MY MA SAYS I AIN'T--

10:33.767 --> 10:35.333
NO, I WANNA
CALL THE COPS RIGHT NOW.

10:35.433 --> 10:37.200
I'M BEING THREATENED
TO BE KILLED.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.733
-OKAY, I APPRECIATE THAT, MAN.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.600
YOU CAN GO BACK INSIDE.
-THAT'S MY LIFE BEING THREATENED

10:40.700 --> 10:42.733
LADY'S TRYING TO TELL ME
TO GO OUT SOMEWHERE,
I CAN'T GO NOWHERE.

10:42.833 --> 10:44.433
-ALL RIGHT.
-10:00 AT NIGHT I'M DONE.

10:45.933 --> 10:47.200
-I'M GONNA GO TALK TO THE MOM.
-OKAY.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.333
-IS THE MOM? YEAH, OKAY.

10:48.433 --> 10:49.733
-I'LL GO IN THERE WITH YOU.
-ALL RIGHT.

10:51.433 --> 10:52.667
-HE'S DRUNK FIRST OF ALL.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.433
AND LIKE I TRIED TO TELL HIM,
"THAT'S IT,

10:54.533 --> 10:56.033
"I WANT MY DESK
WITH MY PHONE.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.433
"YOU'RE-YOU'RE-
I'M CALLING THE POLICE,
I'VE HAD ENOUGH."

10:58.533 --> 11:00.967
-OKAY.
-"I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF YOU THREATENING HIM."

11:01.067 --> 11:03.167
-AND UM,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF,

11:03.267 --> 11:05.367
BUT IN REFERENCE TO THE BLADE,
WHAT EXACTLY WAS IT?

11:05.467 --> 11:08.333
DID YOU GUYS SEE A COLOR ON IT,
HOW BIG IT WAS? OR...

11:08.433 --> 11:10.700
-ALLS I COULD SEE, OFFICER,

11:10.800 --> 11:12.067
WAS LIKE I TOLD
THE OTHER OFFICER,

11:12.167 --> 11:14.500
I COULDN'T SEE
THE COLOR OF THE HANDLE,
-OKAY.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.200
YOU JUST SAW THE BLADE?
-BUT I COULD SEE THE BLADE.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.067
WHEN HE CAME UP HERE...

11:18.100 --> 11:20.533
-YES, MA'AM?
-HE CAME UP INTO HIS FACE.

11:20.633 --> 11:22.900
-IT WAS
SMALL ENOUGH, I KNOW THAT.
-BECAUSE WHAT HE SAID BEFORE--

11:23.067 --> 11:26.067
-SMALL ENOUGH TO HOLD
IN YOUR HAND. IT'S THE ONLY
KNIFE HE HAS IN THAT ROOM.

11:26.133 --> 11:29.067
-"I COULD PUT YOU IN A PINE--
I COULD PUT YOU IN A PINE BOX"?

11:29.133 --> 11:31.367
-"I'LL PUT YOU
IN A (bleep) PINE BOX."
-"I'LL PUT YOU IN THE PINE BOX."

11:31.467 --> 11:34.167
-SO, YOU GUYS FIGHT
LIKE THIS OFTEN, OR...?

11:34.267 --> 11:36.700
-NEVER GOT TO THE POINT
OF A WEAPON PULLED.
-OKAY.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.867
-NEVER. IT'S MOUTH.

11:38.967 --> 11:40.600
-OH.
-THIS IS THE FIRST NIGHT
HE'S DONE THIS,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.800
AND THAT'S WHY
THIS IS THE FIRST NIGHT
YOU'S BEEN CALLED.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.700
I MEAN, ENOUGH.
-WHAT ROOM IS HIS?

11:44.800 --> 11:46.300
-IT'S THE LAST ROOM.
-THAT LAST ROOM OVER THERE.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.733
-THE LAST ROOM?
-DON'T GO IN THERE.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.967
-IT'S A FILTHY-ASS DIRTY ROOM.
-OKAY.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.100
FROM WHAT
I'VE ESTABLISHED SO FAR,

11:55.200 --> 11:56.833
PRETTY MUCH,
THE BROTHER'S UPSET,

11:56.933 --> 12:00.967
CLEARLY, ALCOHOL IS
A ISSUE WITH THEM.

12:01.067 --> 12:04.900
HE HAS OVER
20 BEER CANS HERE,

12:05.067 --> 12:08.100
AND THERE'S THE KNIFE
RIGHT THERE AS WELL. UM...

12:09.633 --> 12:12.200
MOST FAMILIES, THEY HAVE
THEIR MOMENTS OF ARGUING,

12:12.300 --> 12:14.600
BUT IT SEEMS TODAY
IT WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR,

12:14.700 --> 12:17.867
SO HE'S GONNA END UP GOING
TO JAIL FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.633
-HIS PROBLEM IS,
RIGHT THERE--

12:21.733 --> 12:24.433
HE'S COMING OFF
HIS PROBATION RIGHT THERE.

12:24.533 --> 12:27.267
-SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT
HE'S COMING OFF PROBATION?

12:27.367 --> 12:29.833
-PROBATION.
RIGHT FROM PRISON.

12:29.933 --> 12:31.300
HE JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.600
-ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT THAT?

12:32.700 --> 12:34.900
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE ANGRY TODAY? OR...?
-NO. I...

12:36.167 --> 12:38.100
-WHAT I'M ASKING--
-HE DON'T DO A DAMN THING.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.933
HE DON'T GET UP
AND GO TO WORK.

12:40.067 --> 12:41.400
I WORK EVERY DAY,

12:41.500 --> 12:45.867
AND I CAN FRICKING DO (bleep),
AND HE CAN'T EVEN WORK?

12:45.967 --> 12:47.833
-SO YOU'RE UPSET
AT YOUR BROTHER

12:47.933 --> 12:50.667
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T GET UP
IN THE MORNING TO GO TO WORK...

12:50.767 --> 12:53.367
-AND GO TO WORK, NO.
-...AND ALL THAT, AND YOU DO,
SO YOU'RE UPSET?

12:53.467 --> 12:54.933
DID YOU EVER GET PHYSICAL
WITH YOUR BROTHER?

12:55.067 --> 12:57.067
DID YOU EVER
HIT HIM, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
-NO, I DIDN'T HIT HIM.

12:57.133 --> 13:00.667
-OKAY. AT WHAT POINT
DID YOU GRAB A KNIFE
FROM YOUR ROOM?

13:00.767 --> 13:03.733
-I DIDN'T GRAB NO KNIFE.
-LISTEN, HONESTY IS
THE BEST POLICY, OKAY?

13:03.833 --> 13:06.900
THE MORE HONEST
YOU ARE WITH US--

13:07.067 --> 13:09.367
WE'LL GO THERE, OKAY?
-I DIDN'T GRAB A KNIFE
FROM MY ROOM.

13:10.367 --> 13:13.500
-WE FOUND THIS IN YOUR ROOM.
IS THIS WHAT YOU HAD
GRABBED TODAY?

13:13.600 --> 13:15.633
-NO.
-THIS IS NOT WHAT
YOU HAD GRABBED TODAY

13:15.733 --> 13:18.900
WHEN YOUR BROTHER--
-NO, THAT'S BEEN ON MY TABLE
FOR A WHILE.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.400
-ALL RIGHT, WILLIAM.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.967
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE
A DRINKING PROBLEM, MAN?

13:24.233 --> 13:28.700
BE HONEST. WE'RE NOT
OUT HERE TO TRY TO--
-I LIKE TO HAVE A BEER.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.567
YEAH.
-YOUR MOM IS ILL, RIGHT?

13:30.667 --> 13:32.433
-YES. YES.
-...AND YOU FEEL
LIKE IT'S OKAY

13:32.533 --> 13:35.300
FOR HER TO SEE THAT YOU
AND YOUR BROTHER ARE ARGUING

13:35.400 --> 13:38.067
SOMEONE GRABS A KNIFE,
AND IT TURNS INTO
THIS SITUATION?

13:38.100 --> 13:40.067
YOUR MOM DOESN'T NEED
TO SEE THAT STUFF, MAN.
-NO.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.767
-YOUR MOM'S SICK.
-WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO

13:41.867 --> 13:45.633
IS GET HIS ASS UP
AND GO TO WORK, PERIOD.

13:45.733 --> 13:48.533
-ALL RIGHT.
JUST HANG TIGHT, BUDDY.

13:49.933 --> 13:51.967
-I STILL LOVE MY BROTHER,
YES, I DO, BUT YOU KNOW--

13:52.067 --> 13:54.200
-OF COURSE. BLOOD IS
ALWAYS GONNA BE THICKER.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.167
AND, YOU KNOW,
SOONER OR LATER,

13:56.267 --> 14:00.200
ONCE THIS WHOLE PROCESS
GOES BY, YOU KNOW--

14:00.300 --> 14:01.667
-MAN, I DON'T THINK SO.

14:01.767 --> 14:03.067
-YEAH?
-THAT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.067
-EVERY TIME HE GETS DRUNK,
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS?
-YEAH.

14:05.167 --> 14:07.833
THAT'S WHAT--
THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN
PUTTING MY PARENTS THROUGH,

14:07.933 --> 14:09.467
AND I HAD ENOUGH.
-YEAH.

14:09.567 --> 14:12.867
HOPEFULLY, SOONER OR LATER,
HE CAN RECOVER FROM
THAT DRINKING HABIT,

14:12.967 --> 14:16.133
AND WHEN THAT TIME COMES,
YOU'LL BE WILLING TO HELP HIM
OUT WITH THAT.

14:19.367 --> 14:21.067
-I'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR 18 YEARS NOW.

14:21.167 --> 14:24.300
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL
THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS
IN THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.900
LOT OF DIFFERENT
OPPORTUNITIES YOU HAVE,

14:26.067 --> 14:27.700
WORKING FOR
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.900
I LIKE IT WHEN I FIND
SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS
HELP AND I'M ABLE TO HELP 'EM.

14:30.067 --> 14:32.100
IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN ALL THAT OFTEN,
BUT WHEN IT DOES,

14:32.200 --> 14:34.367
IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY FULFILLING THING.

14:34.467 --> 14:36.433
-SO, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN
A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD,

14:36.533 --> 14:38.067
LOOKING FOR A STOLEN VEHICLE.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.767
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A BLUE JEEP IN THE AREA,

14:39.867 --> 14:42.067
AND IT WAS LAST SPOTTED
AT JACK IN THE BOX,

14:42.133 --> 14:44.233
AND SOMEONE SAID
THEY OBSERVED IT
COMING SOUTHBOUND.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.933
-Woman on radio:
SHE'S GOING WEST--

14:46.067 --> 14:48.733
SHE'S GOING EASTBOUND NO...

14:48.833 --> 14:51.133
-TURN.
-...TYLER FROM HAMILTON.

14:51.233 --> 14:53.067
TYLER? IS SHE ON TYLER?

14:53.133 --> 14:56.533
-SHE'S MAPPING RIGHT HERE.
-OKAY, HER MAPPING IS BEHIND.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.233
THERE SHE IS.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.467
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.
-17, X-RAY, WEATHER.

15:05.900 --> 15:09.067
-COMING OVER TO YOU, AMANDA.
ST-STAND UP.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.400
HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD!

15:11.500 --> 15:13.300
TURN AROUND,
FACE THE FENCE.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.533
WALK BACKWARDS TOWARDS ME.

15:15.633 --> 15:17.400
(chatter)

15:17.500 --> 15:20.367
STOP RIGHT THERE.
LIFT YOUR SHIRT UP
SO WE CAN SEE.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.933
SPIN AL THE WAY AROUND.
HOLD THE SHIRT UP.
THERE YOU GO.

15:23.067 --> 15:26.767
KEEP GOING, FACE THE F--
WALK BACKWARDS.

15:26.867 --> 15:27.900
YOU GOT HIM, KENNY?

15:28.067 --> 15:29.067
-YEP.
-ALL RIGHT.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.067
-PASSENGER,
STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE

15:32.167 --> 15:33.600
WITH YOUR HANDS
ABOVE YOUR HEAD.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.400
DO IT THERE.
STOP RIGHT THERE
AND LIFT YOUR SHIRT UP.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.800
THERE YOU GO.
SPIN AROUND SO WE CAN SEE
THE FRONT OF YOU AS WELL,

15:39.900 --> 15:42.067
THEN KEEP GOING TILL YOU'RE
FACING THE FENCE AGAIN.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.733
ALL RIGHT, HANDS BACK UP,
WALK BACKWARDS.

15:44.833 --> 15:47.500
-COME BACK!
-KEEP COMING.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.133
-CLEAR.
-YEP.

15:55.233 --> 15:58.333
-GO UP THERE AND CLEAR THE CAR.
CLEAR THE CAR.

15:58.433 --> 16:01.067
-I'LL GO RIGHT,
YOU GUYS GO LEFT.

16:04.067 --> 16:06.267
-WHERE'D YOU GUYS
JUST COME FROM, KELLY?

16:06.367 --> 16:08.700
-THE PARK.
-THE PARK?
HOW ABOUT BEFORE THAT?

16:08.800 --> 16:11.600
-ANOTHER PARK.
I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC.
-OKAY, WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE?

16:15.167 --> 16:17.167
-SOMETHING I WOULDN'T...

16:20.667 --> 16:24.600
WE'RE TRYING TO GET ALONG,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE...

16:26.100 --> 16:28.067
OUT OF CONTROL
A LITTLE, MAYBE.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.933
-OKAY, IS THIS
BOYFRIEND TO YOU?
HUSBAND? BOYFRIEND?

16:31.067 --> 16:33.667
-BOYFRIEND.
-BOYFRIEND. OKAY, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN TOGETHER?

16:33.767 --> 16:37.267
-IT'S A FEW YEARS.
-OKAY. IS THIS HIS CAR?

16:38.500 --> 16:41.067
-SO... YES, HE JUST SAID
HE JUST GOT IT.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.300
-HE SAID HE JUST GOT IT.
HOW LONG HAS HE HAD IT?

16:44.933 --> 16:46.500
-A WEEK?
-ABOUT A WEEK?

16:46.600 --> 16:50.533
-ALL I KNOW IS IT'S
SOMETHING KEEPING HIM BUSY
AND US APART FOR A WEEK,

16:50.633 --> 16:51.867
AND THEN HE'S GOT...

16:51.967 --> 16:53.800
I FIGURED HE BOUGHT A VEHICLE.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.200
-RECORDS CHECK ON THE FEMALE.

16:56.300 --> 16:59.067
IT SHOWS THAT SHE HAS
AN ACTIVE $10,000 WARRANT

16:59.100 --> 17:01.467
FOR POSSESSION
OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA.

17:01.567 --> 17:04.767
SO NOW DEPUTY SILVEY'S
GOING OVER TO THE CAR

17:04.867 --> 17:06.567
TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE
THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL--

17:06.667 --> 17:08.767
NO FIREARMS OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT-- IN THE CAR

17:08.867 --> 17:11.733
BEFORE WE GET THE REGISTERED
OWNER OVER TO RECOVER
THEIR STOLEN VEHICLE.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.500
-WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT SO FAR?

17:15.600 --> 17:18.967
-UH... THIS WAS
IN THIS BACKPACK,

17:19.067 --> 17:20.933
THAT HAD THE BASEPLATE
FOR THE STEREO IN IT.

17:21.067 --> 17:23.500
-OH.
-SO, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS,

17:23.600 --> 17:25.100
WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK LATER.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.700
THERE'S A BUNCH
OF PILLS HERE.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.900
-THAT ALMOST LOOKS
LIKE MINTS, HUH?

17:30.067 --> 17:31.600
-KIND OF, BUT I DON'T--

17:31.700 --> 17:34.267
NOT THE WAY
THEY WERE WRAPPED UP
WITH HIS PORN AND HIS SEX TOYS.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.067
-OKAY, DOUG, WHOSE CAR?

17:37.133 --> 17:39.133
-THAT'S A FRIEND
OF MINE'S CAR.

17:39.233 --> 17:42.633
-WHAT'S YOUR FRIEND'S NAME?
-HIS NAME IS JASON.

17:43.767 --> 17:46.067
HE GAVE ME THE KEYS, SAID
I COULD DRIVE IT AROUND, SO...

17:46.100 --> 17:47.900
-OKAY, DO YOU KNOW
JASON'S LAST NAME?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.867
-I DON'T KNOW HIS LAST NAME.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.833
JUST MET THE GUY.
-OKAY.

17:53.933 --> 17:56.767
-WHEN DID HE GIVE YOU
THE KEYS?
-TODAY.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.633
-YOU JUST GOT THE JEEP TODAY?
-THIS MORNING, YEAH.

17:58.733 --> 17:59.733
-OKAY.

18:00.800 --> 18:05.067
WHERE WERE YOU BEFORE HERE?
-WE JUST WERE USING IT
TO DRIVE TO THE STORE.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.933
-OKAY. WERE YOU
AT JACK IN THE BOX
AT SOME POINT?

18:07.067 --> 18:09.500
-NO. OH, MAYBE
FOR A SECOND WE PULLED IN THERE

18:09.600 --> 18:12.067
JUST BECAUSE WE WERE ARGUING
WHILE WE WERE DRIVING.

18:12.167 --> 18:14.067
-WAS THERE
A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION
THAT TOOK PLACE THERE?

18:14.167 --> 18:15.600
-NO.
-NO?

18:15.700 --> 18:18.133
-NO.
-KELLY WAS NEVER SCREAMING
FOR HELP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

18:18.233 --> 18:21.867
-SHE WAS PROBABLY YELLING
AT ME, BUT I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT SCREAMING FOR HELP.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.133
-OKAY, BUT NOTHING WAS
A PHYSICAL ATTACK?
-NO.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.233
-OKAY, SO LET ME ASK YOU
A STRAIGHT-UP QUESTION.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.567
I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO KELLY...
-OKAY.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.667
-...AND SHE'S TOLD ME YOU'VE
HAD THE CAR FOR ONE WEEK.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.333
-I HAVEN'T HAD
THAT CAR FOR A WEEK.

18:31.433 --> 18:34.200
A FRIEND OF MINE'S
HAD THE CAR FOR A WEEK.
-OKAY, WHICH FRIEND WAS THAT?

18:34.300 --> 18:35.867
-JASON.
-JASON'S HAD
THE CAR FOR A WEEK?

18:35.967 --> 18:37.433
-YES.
-OKAY.

18:38.433 --> 18:41.067
-I WAS GIVEN THE KEYS,
AND SAID I COULD
DRIVE IT AROUND.

18:41.133 --> 18:42.767
-THAT'S IT.
-OKAY.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.600
-I GOT ALL THE KEYS OVER THERE.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.167
-SO YOU DIDN'T THINK
ANYTHING OF IT?
-NO.

18:46.267 --> 18:49.467
-OKAY. WELL, THE REASON
YOU'RE DETAINED RIGHT NOW

18:49.567 --> 18:52.267
AND THE REASON THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL IS
THAT IT'S A STOLEN VEHICLE.

18:52.367 --> 18:54.333
-OH MAN,
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.133
-OKAY, UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S GONNA BE
A FELONY OFFENSE,

18:56.233 --> 18:57.900
BECAUSE OF THE VALUE
OF THE CAR.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.067
OKAY, SO YOU HAVE
A $10,000 WARRANT

19:01.167 --> 19:03.667
THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEARED UP,
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE GOING
TO JAIL FOR THAT TODAY.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.833
-OKAY.
-BUT THE WAY IT'S LOOKING
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND,

19:05.933 --> 19:07.367
HE'S THE POSSESSOR,
HE'S THE DRIVER,

19:07.467 --> 19:09.867
SO HE'S GONNA
BE GOING FOR POSSESSION
OF A STOLEN VEHICLE.

19:09.967 --> 19:11.933
YOU'RE DEFINITELY
IN LESS HARM'S WAY THAN HE IS.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.800
YOUR WARRANT'S
JUST FOR POSSESSION
OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA,

19:13.900 --> 19:15.900
BUT IT DOES NEED
TO BE CLEARED UP.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.567
SO HE SAYS THAT
HE GOT THE CAR THIS MORNING,

19:18.667 --> 19:20.633
EVEN THOUGH SHE SAYS
HE'S HAD IT FOR A WEEK.

19:20.733 --> 19:21.867
AND THEY'VE JUST BEEN
DRIVING AROUND.

19:21.967 --> 19:23.600
-OKAY, THE PILLS I FOUND
IN THAT BACKPACK

19:23.700 --> 19:26.300
ARE ALL XANAX.
-OKAY.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.900
-WHICH ONE--
WHOSE IS THIS ONE?

19:28.067 --> 19:30.167
-THAT'S... NOT MINE.
-THIS ISN'T YOURS?

19:30.267 --> 19:31.800
-NO.
-OKAY, IS THIS KELLY'S OR...

19:31.900 --> 19:33.967
-I DON'T KNOW WHOSE THAT IS.

19:34.067 --> 19:35.200
-OH WAIT. NO, THAT'S MINE.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.167
-THIS IS YOURS? OKAY.
-YEAH, THAT'S MY BAG.

19:37.267 --> 19:39.233
-SO, THERE'S
AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE, OKAY?

19:39.333 --> 19:42.100
-THERE'S ABOUT 30 PILLS
OF XANAX.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.867
SO, I THINK YOU KNEW
THOSE WERE THERE.

19:43.967 --> 19:45.333
OKAY, THAT'S
A FELONY OFFENSE,

19:45.433 --> 19:48.067
SO NEEDLESS TO SAY,
WE'LL ADD THAT ON THERE.

19:49.133 --> 19:50.167
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.267 --> 19:51.833
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.600
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.700 --> 19:54.633
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.733 --> 19:57.733
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.867 --> 20:06.333
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:06.433 --> 20:07.433
-(theme music playing)
