[girl giggling]

00:25.804 --> 00:27.348
[girl chuckling]

00:28.807 --> 00:31.393
[man] What makes you laugh?

00:31.477 --> 00:33.770
[girl] I'm happy. You make me happy.

00:46.575 --> 00:49.328
[man] A little extra for you
this week, Sunflower.

01:02.258 --> 01:03.675
Come in now.

01:09.723 --> 01:10.724
[boy] You were long today.

01:10.807 --> 01:12.977
Go wash your face and hands!

01:16.855 --> 01:18.815
Give it back!

01:23.201 --> 01:24.619
How much do we have?

01:24.703 --> 01:25.704
I'm busy.

01:25.787 --> 01:27.371
When I'm finished counting,
I will tell you.

01:31.751 --> 01:33.545
Do we have enough to go to the festival?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.131
You're not smart. You never were.

01:37.215 --> 01:38.424
Mother and Father said so.

01:38.508 --> 01:41.427
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm your older brother.

01:41.511 --> 01:42.512
[girl] In years only.

01:42.596 --> 01:45.765
If it weren't for my work,
you'd starve to death in the streets.

01:45.849 --> 01:48.727
All I said was
that I want to go to the festival.

01:48.810 --> 01:50.437
Play for a little while only.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.313
And what do we buy food with?

01:52.396 --> 01:55.233
Look at all these coins.
I'm sure we could spare a few.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.613
Go, then.
But do not return looking for more.

02:05.785 --> 02:08.162
Maybe you aren't
as stupid as I thought, Sidao.

02:08.246 --> 02:10.205
[Jia Sidao] I'm sorry, Mei Lin.

02:15.211 --> 02:16.755
[Mei Lin sobbing]

02:18.507 --> 02:20.509
Great Khan, please!

02:20.592 --> 02:23.803
[Jingim] Lower your eyes
when you speak to the Khan of Khans!

02:23.887 --> 02:26.222
I never meant to harm you!

02:26.305 --> 02:27.474
No!

02:27.557 --> 02:29.518
Only my beloved!

02:30.769 --> 02:32.687
Who sent you?

02:32.771 --> 02:34.898
[Mei Lin] Chancellor Jia Sidao.

02:34.981 --> 02:36.608
[Kublai] He instructed you
to kill the Empress?

02:36.691 --> 02:40.487
[Mei Lin] At first, I was to gather
knowledge of your court.

02:40.570 --> 02:43.322
But he sent an emissary
the night of the White Moon

02:43.406 --> 02:44.533
with new orders.

02:44.616 --> 02:46.493
Why the Empress, not the Khan?

02:49.370 --> 02:51.330
Who knows my brother's mind?

02:53.124 --> 02:54.876
Brother?

02:56.545 --> 02:58.129
[Chabi] Who is the emissary you speak of?

02:58.212 --> 03:01.257
A concubine within the court. A friend.

03:01.340 --> 03:04.844
Does she lay in wait in Cambulac,
to strike as you did?

03:04.928 --> 03:06.596
[Mei Lin] No, she fled.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.808
As soon as she arrives in Xiangyang
with news of my failure,

03:09.891 --> 03:12.226
Jia Sidao will kill my daughter!

03:13.687 --> 03:18.191
I did this, all of this,
to save my little girl!

03:18.274 --> 03:21.570
Empress, you have given birth.

03:21.653 --> 03:23.487
You know the bond between mother and child!

03:23.572 --> 03:25.406
What would you not do to protect them?

03:27.450 --> 03:30.369
-[whimpering] Please, no.
-Whore.

03:30.453 --> 03:35.834
How dare you speak to me of love?

03:37.251 --> 03:41.297
I know the Walled City.
I know the Song court.

03:41.380 --> 03:43.174
My words can save so many lives.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.218
All I ask

03:45.301 --> 03:47.637
is that you save one.

03:54.561 --> 03:56.104
Remove her.

04:01.067 --> 04:03.069
[theme music playing]

05:36.913 --> 05:39.082
[Chabi] The concubine was a tool.

05:39.165 --> 05:42.126
Like a sword, she has no say
into whose body she is thrust.

05:42.210 --> 05:43.837
You wanted her head yourself.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.256
Don't weaken your resolve now, wife.
I will not weaken mine.

05:47.340 --> 05:51.552
What I wanted in a weaker moment,
husband, I resisted.

05:51.635 --> 05:54.889
I ask you do the same.

05:54.973 --> 05:56.307
Allow her life.

05:56.390 --> 06:00.311
To have Buddha on our side
is a great ally, I know this.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.896
But as the Bible says,

06:01.980 --> 06:04.565
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

06:04.648 --> 06:05.734
Kublai,

06:05.817 --> 06:08.945
you quote whatever holiness
suits you at the time.

06:09.028 --> 06:11.489
Are there no shallows
in the lake of your compassion?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.825
Just because she is a mother
who weeps for her child?

06:13.908 --> 06:17.286
Because she is the sister
of our greatest enemy!

06:17.370 --> 06:18.830
[grunts]

06:18.913 --> 06:21.833
And an agent of the Song court.

06:23.667 --> 06:27.338
If you spare her... you may use her.

06:35.388 --> 06:36.931
Fine.

06:37.015 --> 06:38.141
If the bitch lives,

06:38.224 --> 06:42.311
she lives with the knowledge that
everyone she knew has died by my sword.

06:42.979 --> 06:46.315
If you attack Xiangyang,
thousands will perish.

06:46.399 --> 06:47.942
Tens of thousands.

06:48.026 --> 06:49.903
[Chabi] I will not bathe in that blood.

06:49.986 --> 06:52.446
I will not have war in my name.

06:52.530 --> 06:54.282
I deserve revenge.

06:54.365 --> 06:57.368
As do I, my love.

06:57.451 --> 07:01.790
But do not use a battering ram
when an arrow will do.

07:09.172 --> 07:12.091
Let your vengeance fly exactly, Kublai.

07:12.175 --> 07:14.635
There is a better way.

07:21.851 --> 07:22.852
[gasps]

07:22.936 --> 07:23.937
[panting]

07:24.020 --> 07:25.980
[Ahmad] You need not fear.

07:26.064 --> 07:27.356
Shh.

07:28.691 --> 07:32.195
If we wanted you dead...
you wouldn't have awoken.

07:36.825 --> 07:38.910
I've heard the songs they sing about you.

07:39.911 --> 07:43.998
How your brother crawled up
and into the Imperial Court

07:44.082 --> 07:46.625
through the wet spot in your bed.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.839
Whose prisoner am I?

07:50.922 --> 07:53.091
You are the prisoner of the Grand Khan.

07:54.300 --> 07:57.053
Then why am I in your quarters?

07:58.179 --> 08:01.015
All currency is my jurisdiction.

08:02.433 --> 08:05.019
And whores are bought and sold.

08:05.103 --> 08:06.145
[groans]

08:07.771 --> 08:09.732
Why does your brother
want Empress Chabi dead?

08:09.816 --> 08:13.820
To defeat Kublai
in the shadow of the Walled City

08:13.903 --> 08:18.282
would win Sidao great fame
and save the Song dynasty.

08:18.366 --> 08:22.745
If the Khan leaves these gates,
he brings the wrath of Genghis.

08:24.163 --> 08:26.082
Has your brother no wisdom?

08:26.165 --> 08:27.876
Some men have mastered wisdom,

08:28.960 --> 08:30.879
some devilry.

08:30.962 --> 08:35.549
Does Sidao hide devilry
behind the walls of Xiangyang?

08:38.928 --> 08:40.554
Of course.

08:40.638 --> 08:43.349
If you knew
and surrendered that information,

08:43.432 --> 08:45.518
you'd be out of currency, wouldn't you?

08:48.312 --> 08:49.438
[Mei Lin] Why do this?

08:50.481 --> 08:52.859
Pretend to care.

08:56.487 --> 08:57.780
You will heal.

08:58.822 --> 09:00.283
Fully, I expect.

09:06.205 --> 09:07.498
[croaking]

09:07.581 --> 09:09.125
[Ling Ling] I want to see!

09:12.003 --> 09:13.379
[giggling]

09:14.755 --> 09:16.049
Ling!

09:25.683 --> 09:27.226
[Ling Ling] I missed you.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.478
I've missed you, too, sweet one.

09:29.562 --> 09:32.899
I must speak to the Empress.
We will play later, yes?

09:41.407 --> 09:44.243
[Empress Dowager]
Something pains you, my child.

09:44.327 --> 09:47.413
[Jing Fei] What I'm about to confess
could lose me my head.

09:47.496 --> 09:49.999
[Empress Dowager] Are you certain
I am an appropriate confessor?

09:50.083 --> 09:53.669
[Jing Fei] I can only hope...
for I have nowhere else to turn.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.760
I have lied to the Chancellor.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.976
[Empress Dowager]
A word of truth lasts forever.

10:09.185 --> 10:12.188
A lie lasts only a moment, my child.

10:12.271 --> 10:15.233
Jia Sidao sent me to Cambulac

10:15.316 --> 10:18.694
to find Mei Lin and charge her
to assassinate the Mongol queen.

10:18.777 --> 10:20.529
Lady Chabi is dead?

10:20.613 --> 10:21.905
No, Empress.

10:21.990 --> 10:23.532
Mei Lin failed.

10:24.533 --> 10:26.452
But I reported otherwise.

10:27.453 --> 10:31.040
It's only a matter of time before
the Chancellor discovers my deceit.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.377
I have signed my own decree of death.

10:35.503 --> 10:37.421
And Ling's too, I fear.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.681
Then a lie must last one day longer.

10:48.975 --> 10:52.603
When the sun sets tomorrow,
so will Sidao's service.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.063
He's done.

10:55.398 --> 10:56.815
And Ling?

10:56.899 --> 10:58.901
[Empress Dowager]
We all must bide our time.

10:58.985 --> 11:02.571
Keep her from the Chancellor
until after the coronation.

11:04.782 --> 11:10.079
Be strong, young one,
for your charge and for your future.

11:10.997 --> 11:12.165
[Ling Ling laughing]

11:17.336 --> 11:20.131
You are a Taoist monk.

11:20.214 --> 11:24.510
Permitted to eat meat, drink wine,
enjoy a woman.

11:24.593 --> 11:25.803
Yet...

11:25.886 --> 11:27.930
you have never taken a wife.

11:29.182 --> 11:33.018
I devoted my life to the service
of the Great Khan and his empire.

11:33.102 --> 11:36.605
I only have so much time on this earth.

11:36.689 --> 11:40.859
I have never taken a wife because
I do my best to avoid disappointment.

11:40.943 --> 11:42.070
[Kublai] Hmm.

11:43.404 --> 11:46.324
My second wife, she has a golden tongue.

11:47.491 --> 11:49.827
You are blessed, Lord Kublai.

11:51.079 --> 11:54.957
I give her gold to keep it
in the abyss she calls a mouth.

11:55.791 --> 11:56.834
My third wife...

11:57.876 --> 12:02.506
she has small and wrinkled teats,
like the dried fruit on a fig tree.

12:04.007 --> 12:05.593
But Chabi...

12:06.969 --> 12:11.014
she is an irreproachable gift
from the Eternal Blue Sky.

12:12.975 --> 12:15.644
Had someone taken her from me...

12:22.318 --> 12:27.281
You will go to Xiangyang
and kill Chancellor Jia Sidao.

12:32.035 --> 12:35.456
Some may question
the wisdom of sending a blind monk

12:35.539 --> 12:37.791
to assassinate the prime minister.

12:37.875 --> 12:41.920
A blind monk who
once killed 25 of my best soldiers.

12:43.797 --> 12:48.761
A Wudang warrior said to be
able to pass through walls unseen.

12:48.844 --> 12:51.054
Suddenly, you are lame?

12:54.433 --> 12:57.436
And should I pass through
the open gates of Cambulac,

12:57.520 --> 12:59.438
what makes you think I will ever return?

12:59.522 --> 13:01.940
What makes you think I want you to?

13:04.152 --> 13:07.863
The Latin, is he accomplished?

13:07.946 --> 13:10.366
For someone who has no accomplishments.

13:10.449 --> 13:11.909
Good.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.077
He will be your eyes and escort.

13:15.454 --> 13:17.331
[Hundred Eyes] You do not listen, do you?

13:17.415 --> 13:19.750
[Kublai] Oh, I do listen.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.085
Then I hear what I want to.

13:23.629 --> 13:25.881
Princess.

13:25.964 --> 13:29.218
Empress Chabi has summoned you to court.

13:29.302 --> 13:32.846
Has she summoned
all the women of the Hall of Fragrance?

13:35.933 --> 13:37.393
Only you.

13:38.561 --> 13:41.480
She has never invited me
for a private audience.

13:41.564 --> 13:42.731
Be calm.

13:42.815 --> 13:44.983
Lady Chabi knows nothing of your past.

13:45.067 --> 13:47.820
You are the Blue Princess of Bayaut.

13:47.903 --> 13:49.530
-No one will challenge this.
-[sighs]

13:49.613 --> 13:51.615
I challenge it.

13:55.118 --> 13:56.287
[sighs]

14:00.416 --> 14:02.960
Worry not, Princess.

14:05.421 --> 14:07.756
I will make you regal.

14:15.556 --> 14:16.849
[Kublai] Ah!

14:18.058 --> 14:21.144
What is the reach of
the highest wall in Italy?

14:21.229 --> 14:26.317
The upper church of
the Basilica Papale di San Francesco.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.735
It stands five stories.

14:27.818 --> 14:31.029
To bring your people
that much closer to your God?

14:32.198 --> 14:33.657
Or further from our demons.

14:33.741 --> 14:35.534
[Kublai laughs]

14:35.618 --> 14:38.871
Now, imagine a wall stretching
far closer to the sky.

14:39.622 --> 14:40.998
Xiangyang.

14:41.081 --> 14:44.167
I present to you the gerege.

14:44.252 --> 14:48.256
With this golden tablet,
gates will open before you

14:48.339 --> 14:50.341
as you ride to the south.

14:53.677 --> 14:57.097
You will infiltrate the Song fortress.

14:57.180 --> 14:59.141
While Hundred Eyes attends to his task,

14:59.225 --> 15:02.603
you will gather information
as to the defenses of the rebels.

15:04.230 --> 15:07.190
May I inquire as to Hundred Eyes' task?

15:07.275 --> 15:09.818
He will kill Chancellor Jia Sidao.

15:10.903 --> 15:13.656
[Ahmad] Sidao's sister has
an ally within the walls.

15:13.739 --> 15:17.075
Another whore by the name of Jing Fei.

15:17.159 --> 15:19.953
She also utilized a treacherous
stable-boy from our slums

15:20.037 --> 15:21.705
to send messages to Xiangyang.

15:21.789 --> 15:23.582
That is all we have learned at this time.

15:23.666 --> 15:25.959
The Song coronation draws near.

15:26.960 --> 15:31.840
In that moment, the Empress Dowager
will preside over a shift in power.

15:31.924 --> 15:35.428
Sidao seeks to secure war
before that happens.

15:35.511 --> 15:37.846
Securing war secures his power.

15:37.930 --> 15:40.015
His death averts it.

15:41.767 --> 15:44.353
Ride swiftly, Master Marco.

15:57.408 --> 16:00.744
Mei Lin has a message
she would like delivered to Jing Fei.

16:02.538 --> 16:05.374
I do not know these names you speak.

16:28.564 --> 16:33.110
[Jia Sidao] Your family, their village,
is it far from here?

16:33.193 --> 16:34.320
No, Chancellor.

16:35.613 --> 16:38.949
You do not need to
call me that, brightness.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.493
Not anymore.

16:41.910 --> 16:44.413
What would you have me call you?

16:46.499 --> 16:47.833
What do you like?

16:48.792 --> 16:51.044
You are my Chancellor.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.634
Which village is it?

16:56.717 --> 16:57.718
Luzhi.

16:57.801 --> 16:58.844
I do not know it.

16:58.927 --> 17:01.304
It is quite insignificant.

17:01.389 --> 17:02.515
Impossible.

17:02.598 --> 17:04.974
It produced you.

17:07.185 --> 17:08.396
Do you see them?

17:08.479 --> 17:10.146
Your parents?

17:11.898 --> 17:13.442
Why?

17:15.778 --> 17:17.820
They do not approve of me.

17:19.865 --> 17:21.617
They are ashamed.

17:26.914 --> 17:28.874
There are so many rules.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.837
It is the rules that build the walls.

17:36.799 --> 17:38.426
To keep us apart.

17:42.596 --> 17:46.517
And no matter how we wish
to break those walls down...

17:48.602 --> 17:50.521
the rules allow no margin.

17:53.524 --> 17:55.067
So there we are,

17:55.150 --> 17:57.611
resting our hands
on either side of the divide.

18:00.864 --> 18:03.867
No matter the side, we are just people.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.913
That's why I did what I did.

18:09.081 --> 18:10.874
For you people.

18:14.712 --> 18:17.005
Do you believe that to be true?

18:18.131 --> 18:21.802
I believe your heart and your mind
are true to one another.

18:26.014 --> 18:27.182
In this moment...

18:28.809 --> 18:30.728
you are most significant to me.

18:42.740 --> 18:46.159
Do you wish to take me, my Chancellor?

18:49.287 --> 18:52.124
[young Mei Lin giggling]

18:53.416 --> 18:55.252
I... I need you to tell me.

18:56.754 --> 18:58.631
Tell me once again.

19:02.092 --> 19:05.554
The Khan's wife is dead.

19:06.889 --> 19:10.934
Mei Lin announced her cause
and you her master

19:11.018 --> 19:13.311
as she slew the Empress.

19:16.565 --> 19:20.027
Do you wish to take me?

19:25.908 --> 19:28.869
I wish to pay a visit
to your parents' house...

19:29.870 --> 19:32.372
to try to correct their way of thinking.

20:04.947 --> 20:06.740
[greeting indistinctly]

20:20.378 --> 20:22.965
This is Ba-Tu. Care for him well.

20:23.048 --> 20:25.884
Until my return.

20:25.968 --> 20:27.636
[Hundred Eyes] We've got to keep moving.

20:31.473 --> 20:32.474
[urging horse]

20:34.184 --> 20:37.813
[Byamba] The scum have attacked our father,

20:37.896 --> 20:39.522
the Lord Khan!

20:39.607 --> 20:42.776
The vermin have attacked the Empress!

20:42.860 --> 20:45.070
The Song have vowed to destroy

20:45.153 --> 20:47.948
everything that we prize and hold dear!

20:48.991 --> 20:51.869
Do the sons of Genghis accept this quietly?

20:51.952 --> 20:55.205
-[all] No! No!
-Good!

20:55.288 --> 20:58.375
My men and the men
who follow Princess Khutulun

20:58.458 --> 21:02.170
become one force with one purpose!

21:02.254 --> 21:05.591
To teach the Song devils
that we are Mongols

21:05.674 --> 21:07.217
and the world is ours!

21:07.300 --> 21:09.052
[all shouting]

21:09.136 --> 21:10.638
Why should we follow the Princess?

21:11.680 --> 21:13.766
I understand your apprehension.

21:13.849 --> 21:16.476
What does a girl know of battle?

21:16.559 --> 21:20.563
What of your great-grandmothers
who rode into war with Genghis Khan?

21:20.648 --> 21:24.735
To erase your doubts and ease your fears,

21:24.818 --> 21:27.362
I will wrestle the best of you.

21:27.445 --> 21:28.530
[man] Byamba!

21:28.614 --> 21:33.160
[all chanting] Byamba! Byamba! Byamba!

21:33.243 --> 21:35.537
Byamba! Byamba!

21:35.621 --> 21:40.709
Byamba! Byamba! Byamba!

21:40.793 --> 21:42.795
[all cheering]

21:50.636 --> 21:53.096
[horn blowing]

21:57.893 --> 21:59.311
[crowd] Ohh!

22:12.074 --> 22:13.408
[crowd] Ohh!

22:14.284 --> 22:15.285
[yells]

22:25.212 --> 22:26.254
[Khutulun grunts]

22:26.338 --> 22:28.298
You're not the butterfly I expected.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.633
And you are not the lioness!

22:37.182 --> 22:39.267
[panting]

22:52.197 --> 22:53.615
[all cheering]

23:06.461 --> 23:09.131
[Chabi] Is the Hall of Fragrance
suitable to your comfort?

23:10.465 --> 23:14.177
[Kokachin] Yes, it is most pleasing.

23:14.261 --> 23:17.765
Tell me about the palace
in which you were raised.

23:17.848 --> 23:20.893
It pales beside
the palace of the Lord Khan.

23:20.976 --> 23:22.185
You miss it?

23:22.269 --> 23:26.899
I miss the fresh blue lake...
and my friend, Nergüi.

23:26.982 --> 23:28.691
What became of her?

23:28.776 --> 23:30.819
She died.

23:30.903 --> 23:32.946
During the siege?

23:33.030 --> 23:34.322
Yes.

23:34.406 --> 23:39.077
It must be difficult living amongst
those who massacred your people.

23:40.370 --> 23:43.540
My people had the opportunity to surrender.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.793
They chose to fight.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.590
You have friends here in Cambulac?

23:52.674 --> 23:55.135
My eunuch cares for me well.

23:56.344 --> 23:59.347
What of your sisters
in the Hall of Fragrance?

24:02.184 --> 24:06.563
They have little understanding
of the people or of the land.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.190
You find them unworthy?

24:09.482 --> 24:11.068
They're worthy in their ways

24:11.151 --> 24:14.112
but know not of the horse and bow.

24:14.863 --> 24:17.032
Life's truest pleasures.

24:19.242 --> 24:22.871
My days of riding unfettered
have long since passed.

24:24.289 --> 24:27.000
We were raised in very similar fashion.

24:27.084 --> 24:30.545
Perhaps we might ride
together one day, Empress.

24:30.628 --> 24:32.130
Tell me, Princess...

24:33.340 --> 24:35.884
how do you see your future?

24:35.968 --> 24:37.094
My Lady?

24:37.177 --> 24:40.848
You know that you will not inhabit
the Hall of Fragrance forever.

24:41.974 --> 24:44.392
I never really think about it.

24:44.476 --> 24:46.519
You may open your heart to me.

24:46.603 --> 24:49.564
I was once your age.

24:49.647 --> 24:52.985
I know the dreams
that cloud a royal virgin's head.

24:54.987 --> 24:56.779
I may have wondered.

24:56.864 --> 24:59.324
Who is the lucky man of your thoughts?

25:00.325 --> 25:03.453
Is he a prince? A king?

25:03.536 --> 25:04.746
[chuckles]

25:04.829 --> 25:08.125
Power and prestige are the concern
of the other girls, Lady Chabi.

25:08.208 --> 25:11.669
Surely, when you close your eyes at night,

25:11.753 --> 25:14.256
you pray for a man of noble character.

25:14.339 --> 25:19.469
To give my future husband many sons,
that is all I pray for.

25:21.763 --> 25:24.516
We shall talk much, Princess.

25:28.686 --> 25:31.731
[Jingim] My father sent Polo
to assassinate our enemy.

25:31.814 --> 25:33.066
Why can I not understand this?

25:33.150 --> 25:36.111
- Please, explain this to me.
-[Ahmad] Your father has his reasons.

25:36.194 --> 25:38.363
[Jingim] I have this
terrible recurring thought.

25:39.322 --> 25:42.200
Perhaps the wrong brother fell bloody
in the dirt all those months ago.

25:42.284 --> 25:44.953
Do not repeat those words aloud, my Prince.

25:45.037 --> 25:46.329
I will forget them myself.

25:46.413 --> 25:50.208
Make no mistake, Ahmad,
I love my father, I revered him.

25:50.292 --> 25:51.626
"Revered"?

25:52.794 --> 25:56.048
The kingdom has turned its eyes away
as it relates to my father's pets.

25:56.131 --> 25:57.966
But no other has risen so quickly

25:58.050 --> 26:01.386
or closely to his side than the Latin.

26:01.469 --> 26:04.722
"Open the gates to outsiders
and secrets will spill."

26:04.806 --> 26:08.018
My uncle said those words to me
when I traveled to Karakorum.

26:08.726 --> 26:11.354
He may not have been referring
specifically to the round-eyed rat,

26:11.438 --> 26:12.772
but he could sense it.

26:12.855 --> 26:16.276
My advice? Let us see what transpires.

26:16.359 --> 26:18.653
If Jia Sidao falls and the wall with him,

26:18.736 --> 26:20.322
then the boy is beyond reproach.

26:20.405 --> 26:22.615
Your father's plan would have succeeded.

26:22.699 --> 26:24.117
But if he fails

26:24.201 --> 26:27.870
and if the Khan is not motivated to
push the boy aside by his own hand,

26:27.955 --> 26:30.915
then we will guide it for him.

26:39.007 --> 26:42.302
[Jia Sidao] The death of Empress Chabi
puts us in a position of power.

26:42.385 --> 26:45.680
It was the act of a coward and a scoundrel.

26:45.763 --> 26:47.640
What lives will our people have

26:47.724 --> 26:50.268
when they're enslaved by the Mongol hordes?

26:52.145 --> 26:54.106
I so tire of this conversation.

26:54.189 --> 26:56.566
The coronation is upon us.

26:56.649 --> 26:59.027
You will be filled with vigor soon enough.

26:59.111 --> 27:00.320
And in the end,

27:00.403 --> 27:03.406
you may have achieved what you set out to.

27:03.490 --> 27:05.450
Our position at the negotiating table

27:05.533 --> 27:08.495
has been weakened by
your foolish play against the Khan.

27:08.578 --> 27:10.872
And this is why I suggest, once more,

27:10.955 --> 27:14.251
that we postpone the transfer of power
until certainty dawns.

27:14.334 --> 27:15.460
No.

27:21.424 --> 27:23.135
Did your sister fall?

27:23.218 --> 27:25.595
One can only assume.

27:26.971 --> 27:29.557
Is there no hole in your heart?

27:29.641 --> 27:31.726
Do you not fear the admission to a daughter

27:31.809 --> 27:34.729
who must face a life without a mother?

27:35.897 --> 27:37.607
Life will continue.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.401
[inhales deeply]

27:39.484 --> 27:41.236
And I hope, as her memory fades,

27:41.319 --> 27:44.031
Ling will only remember
Mei Lin for what she was...

27:45.032 --> 27:46.574
a whore.

27:48.410 --> 27:51.038
After you've packed your porcelain,

27:51.121 --> 27:53.581
we will clean up the shambles
you've left behind.

27:53.665 --> 27:55.917
What choice do I have?

27:56.000 --> 27:59.879
You have succeeded
in your mission, Empress.

27:59.962 --> 28:02.424
May I remain after the ink has dried?

28:03.466 --> 28:07.679
To bear witness the outcome
of your bargains with the devil.

28:07.762 --> 28:10.390
You are a free man, Jia Sidao.

28:10.473 --> 28:15.145
Free from responsibility, free from blame,

28:15.228 --> 28:18.148
free to stake your claim
wherever you see fit.

28:19.149 --> 28:22.485
Outside the palace.

28:22.569 --> 28:25.572
You will always be a citizen of the Song.

28:27.324 --> 28:29.242
If only that were true.

28:40.045 --> 28:42.672
It is as if the gates of hell have opened.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.217
It is the warm embrace of home.

28:46.718 --> 28:48.761
When did you last feel it?

28:50.012 --> 28:52.432
Be mindful of our mission, Master Polo.

28:52.515 --> 28:54.309
It is a hard thing we do.

28:55.268 --> 28:58.146
A hard thing you do, Sifu.

28:59.897 --> 29:02.442
I draw pictures while you draw blood.

29:02.525 --> 29:05.820
The Khan makes considerations
for my failure

29:05.903 --> 29:07.447
and entrusts you with them.

29:08.030 --> 29:10.283
That is no small thing.

29:16.248 --> 29:17.874
This may not end well.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.959
You continue on, however.

29:21.586 --> 29:25.132
One death weighed against a massacre.

29:25.215 --> 29:28.176
And should we fail,
we fail for a true cause.

29:28.260 --> 29:31.012
[laughs]

29:31.096 --> 29:33.223
Did I say something to amuse you?

29:34.432 --> 29:38.060
[Hundred Eyes] I fear your mind
has followed your body into bondage.

29:39.854 --> 29:41.981
You do not believe in the cause?

29:43.275 --> 29:47.195
What one chooses to believe in
and what one is compelled to believe in,

29:47.279 --> 29:49.281
there is a difference.

30:09.134 --> 30:10.760
Don't stop.

31:07.984 --> 31:09.611
Stop!

31:12.739 --> 31:14.407
What is your purpose here?

31:15.408 --> 31:17.494
Open up, show me!

31:19.371 --> 31:21.914
-Get away! Move! Go.
-Hey!

31:21.998 --> 31:23.583
You want to see?

31:23.666 --> 31:25.001
Here.

31:26.378 --> 31:27.754
In honor of the Emperor.

31:27.837 --> 31:30.423
You wish to confiscate
the food of His Holiness?

31:49.776 --> 31:50.943
Where is she?

31:51.027 --> 31:53.195
She is favored by the Chancellor.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.407
I will not bring her round
in the light of day.

31:55.490 --> 31:57.575
If I sense you've raised an alarm,

31:57.659 --> 32:00.287
I will find you before my days are done.

32:00.370 --> 32:02.038
Do you believe me?

32:03.373 --> 32:05.958
I could have left you at the gate, monk.

32:06.751 --> 32:10.547
Once I finish,
I will no longer be at your service...

32:10.630 --> 32:11.631
yes?

32:12.799 --> 32:13.841
Mmm.

32:14.384 --> 32:17.595
Meet me here when the moon is low.

32:39.951 --> 32:42.787
[Chabi] My son, home from the hunt.

32:43.788 --> 32:46.123
I see your new hawk proves well.

32:46.207 --> 32:48.710
A fruitful and welcome diversion.

32:50.086 --> 32:51.796
Were you on the grasslands?

32:51.879 --> 32:53.840
Your mother is a lovely rider.

32:53.923 --> 32:56.634
I can only assume the Princess is as well.

32:56.718 --> 33:00.972
It was difficult to discern through
all the dust kicked in my face.

33:03.308 --> 33:06.018
He stands several hands higher
than a Mongol pony.

33:06.102 --> 33:09.606
Mongolian crossed with warmer blood.

33:09.689 --> 33:11.566
-Quite handsome.
-Isn't he?

33:13.067 --> 33:15.027
-[Jingim] Mother.
-[Kokachin chuckles]

33:15.111 --> 33:16.529
Do I embarrass you?

33:17.572 --> 33:19.407
[Sorga] He is quite handsome.

33:19.491 --> 33:20.617
My daughter.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.159
Princess.

33:23.285 --> 33:24.954
Shall we continue?

33:43.723 --> 33:46.934
[Byamba] Are you planning on whittling her
down to a skewer for the open fire?

33:47.018 --> 33:48.853
I think you're ready.

33:50.187 --> 33:51.439
I'm more than ready.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.316
War is easy.

33:54.401 --> 33:55.902
The waiting will kill you.

33:58.780 --> 34:01.073
How do you call your shiny friend?

34:02.617 --> 34:04.452
Decisive.

34:04.536 --> 34:07.246
That's a beneficial trait
for the one who wields her.

34:07.329 --> 34:10.291
As well as for the one
about to receive its sharpened end.

34:12.877 --> 34:15.170
Do you wish to talk about it?

34:15.254 --> 34:17.297
What is there to talk about?

34:17.382 --> 34:20.385
Was it merely theater in front of
the troops the other day?

34:20.467 --> 34:21.844
[Khutulun scoffs]

34:21.928 --> 34:23.679
You beat me. Why do you doubt?

34:23.763 --> 34:26.808
I have seen you defeat far more
proficient wrestlers than me.

34:26.891 --> 34:28.100
I do not have the skills...

34:28.184 --> 34:30.395
Or the balls to marry me.

34:30.478 --> 34:32.647
So it was a ploy.

34:33.815 --> 34:37.275
You lost by design in order
to secure my hand in marriage.

34:37.359 --> 34:40.279
You think much of yourself, Byamba.

34:40.362 --> 34:43.824
If I wanted you,
I would have had you years ago.

34:45.076 --> 34:49.080
But for now, I am engaged to Decisive.

34:51.958 --> 34:54.543
I would never sever you from your blade.

34:55.545 --> 34:57.880
You needn't sacrifice one for the other.

34:57.964 --> 34:59.924
The other?

35:01.175 --> 35:03.094
We are warriors.

35:04.429 --> 35:06.305
Yes.

35:06.388 --> 35:08.475
Battle me.

35:23.823 --> 35:24.824
[screaming]

35:27.744 --> 35:29.954
I've done my part. As promised.

35:30.037 --> 35:32.414
You said I would be
released from my service.

35:32.499 --> 35:33.583
You are.

35:41.633 --> 35:44.594
-[Jing Fei screaming]
-[Marco] Stop it! Stop!

35:44.677 --> 35:47.472
We need to speak about Mei Lin.

35:51.518 --> 35:53.227
She is dead?

35:53.310 --> 35:56.481
She was spared
for the sake of her daughter.

35:57.690 --> 35:59.441
She said you could help us.

35:59.526 --> 36:02.028
I do not know you, foreigner.
How can I trust you?

36:02.111 --> 36:04.321
I do not have the time to earn it.

36:04.405 --> 36:06.198
Your choice.

36:06.282 --> 36:09.911
Step aside, Hundred Eyes.
Let her run if she wishes.

36:11.954 --> 36:14.123
[Jing Fei breathing heavily]

36:21.088 --> 36:22.632
I come from Cambulac with news

36:22.715 --> 36:26.135
of the Great Khan's
pending assault on your city.

36:27.428 --> 36:30.932
Thousands from the barbarian horde
will descend.

36:31.974 --> 36:34.143
Song blood will flow like the Yangtze.

36:34.226 --> 36:37.980
And you want me
to help you bring this about?

36:38.064 --> 36:41.609
I want you to help us prevent it.

37:03.881 --> 37:05.717
You must listen to me, Tulga.

37:05.800 --> 37:09.345
Our lives are in jeopardy.
The Empress Chabi asks many questions.

37:09.428 --> 37:12.223
It has become clear that
she seeks another bride for the Prince.

37:12.306 --> 37:13.975
That is fine. We run.

37:14.058 --> 37:16.435
-It is different now.
-How is it different?

37:16.518 --> 37:18.688
We can be miles away before
she notices you are gone.

37:18.771 --> 37:20.189
That is impossible.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.899
What are you saying?

37:21.983 --> 37:24.443
You must leave this place without me.

37:24.526 --> 37:26.403
Then at least you will be safe.

37:26.487 --> 37:28.030
I will not.

37:28.114 --> 37:31.492
Someday, we shall be as one
in the Blue Sky, if not before.

37:31.576 --> 37:33.494
For now, you must leave.

37:33.578 --> 37:35.955
Do not contact me again.

37:52.513 --> 37:54.098
[gasps]

37:57.143 --> 37:58.310
Where were you?

38:00.396 --> 38:03.733
I came to you, earlier.

38:03.816 --> 38:07.486
My apologies, my Chancellor,
for not being present for you.

38:11.032 --> 38:12.574
[sighs]

38:12.659 --> 38:15.870
A gift from our brothers-in-arms
in Quinsai...

38:17.204 --> 38:19.415
for our Emperor's coronation.

38:26.588 --> 38:28.883
A peculiar substance.

38:31.761 --> 38:33.137
Where were you?

38:42.647 --> 38:44.315
At the pleasure house.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.152
I lay with no man,

38:48.235 --> 38:52.323
but... I will never lie to you.

38:52.406 --> 38:55.284
I fear for my future in this house
when you are gone.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.954
I sought assurance from the madam
that I might return to service.

38:58.037 --> 39:00.122
I will not have it.

39:00.206 --> 39:02.875
I have no choice.

39:06.754 --> 39:09.674
My meager skills demand it.

39:13.177 --> 39:14.804
Do not say that.

39:15.930 --> 39:17.473
I was mistaken.

39:19.183 --> 39:21.518
I did not know your heart at the time.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.283
[Imperial Regent] We carry this holy edict

39:36.367 --> 39:38.786
in name of our benevolent Emperor

39:38.870 --> 39:41.205
on this, his coronation day.

39:42.832 --> 39:45.417
May his virtue extend to
the boundaries of heaven.

39:46.668 --> 39:49.922
May his benevolence sustain the world.

40:00.850 --> 40:03.435
I will be here with horses
when you finish, Sifu.

40:04.645 --> 40:06.147
Godspeed.

40:21.578 --> 40:23.247
[Imperial regent] To exalt virtue,

40:23.330 --> 40:28.836
so that all should cherish
the spirit of kindness and meekness,

40:28.920 --> 40:33.632
and that they should all enjoy
a reign of eternal peace.

41:27.228 --> 41:29.271
"I hear and I forget."

41:29.355 --> 41:31.148
I see and I remember.

41:32.233 --> 41:34.151
"I do and I understand."

41:35.736 --> 41:37.071
Do you know this proverb?

41:37.154 --> 41:38.780
All too well.

41:40.199 --> 41:41.993
Do you believe in it?

41:43.494 --> 41:46.914
I do not judge the decisions
that you have made,

41:46.998 --> 41:49.083
and I will not understand

41:49.166 --> 41:53.712
until you set a scholar's pen to parchment.

41:57.216 --> 41:58.968
[Imperial Regent]
May his righteousness guide

41:59.051 --> 42:02.013
the teeming multitudes of Song dynasty

42:02.096 --> 42:03.890
with great reverence

42:03.973 --> 42:07.852
and by the 16 Maxims of The Sacred Edict.

43:59.588 --> 44:01.257
[grunting]

44:40.962 --> 44:43.174
Who sent you, monk?

45:10.117 --> 45:12.744
You must take her with you.

45:12.828 --> 45:14.788
-Who is she?
-Mei Lin's daughter.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.086
Is it complete?

45:20.169 --> 45:21.170
[Hundred Eyes] No, it's not.

45:26.717 --> 45:27.759
Come with us.

45:27.843 --> 45:30.887
The Empress needs an ally.
I'm all that remains.

45:30.971 --> 45:33.099
Don't be scared.
He'll take you to your mother.

45:33.182 --> 45:34.683
He'll keep you safe.

45:34.766 --> 45:35.809
[Ling Ling] I'll miss you.

45:35.892 --> 45:37.811
We must ride.

45:39.313 --> 45:41.022
[Ling Ling] Jing Fei!

46:14.473 --> 46:17.893
Are you prepared to take
your throne, my Emperor?

46:17.976 --> 46:19.811
Yes.

47:00.602 --> 47:03.021
They work at pace to repair it.

47:03.104 --> 47:06.567
But as of now... that is our way in.

47:20.038 --> 47:21.415
[Kublai] The Great Genghis,

47:22.749 --> 47:24.501
he of the wolf,

47:24.585 --> 47:27.128
dreamed of a Mongol empire

47:27.213 --> 47:29.840
stretching throughout all of China.

47:31.007 --> 47:36.222
I have sought to realize his dream
without spilling Mongol blood.

47:37.264 --> 47:39.600
I have been patient.

47:39.683 --> 47:41.810
My patience has been rewarded...

47:43.186 --> 47:47.274
with the severed heads of men
who have marched beside you.

47:48.191 --> 47:51.445
My scholars, ministers

47:51.528 --> 47:55.532
advised me to choose peace over war.

47:56.742 --> 47:59.578
But I am a proud Mongol.

47:59.661 --> 48:01.705
At times...

48:01.788 --> 48:05.292
peace can only be achieved
through cruel war.

48:07.753 --> 48:10.381
We begin the expedition

48:10.464 --> 48:13.509
to fulfill our destiny.

48:13.592 --> 48:15.176
You noble men

48:16.845 --> 48:21.267
willing to die for a cause
greater than yourselves,

48:21.350 --> 48:22.893
return not with wealth,

48:24.102 --> 48:25.562
nor slaves,

48:26.605 --> 48:28.274
but with honor.

48:29.816 --> 48:32.569
Those of you who do not return

48:32.653 --> 48:34.571
will have your names carved

48:34.655 --> 48:37.073
in the Secret History of the Mongols.

48:38.325 --> 48:42.037
Your wives, children and parents

48:42.120 --> 48:46.458
will hold their heads above other Mongols,

48:46.542 --> 48:50.504
because in their hearts they know

48:50.587 --> 48:55.717
their husbands, fathers, their sons

48:55.801 --> 49:01.973
gave their lives in pursuit of
the last dream of our Great Genghis!

49:02.974 --> 49:04.351
[all chanting] For Genghis!

49:04.435 --> 49:05.644
For Genghis!

49:05.727 --> 49:07.521
For Genghis!

49:07.604 --> 49:09.440
March!

49:47.936 --> 49:49.938
