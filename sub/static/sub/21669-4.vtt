WEBVTT

00:00.747 --> 00:02.599
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.600 --> 00:04.735
We got one person
breaking this team down.

00:04.736 --> 00:06.670
You're gonna be going home.
I'm not going home not tonight.

00:06.671 --> 00:08.740
Barbie solidified her reputation

00:08.741 --> 00:12.110
as public enemy number one...

00:12.111 --> 00:13.278
Wake up.

00:13.279 --> 00:14.879
When she got revenge...

00:14.880 --> 00:16.548
What the is that?

00:16.549 --> 00:18.616
By waking
up the entire dorm.

00:18.617 --> 00:20.618
You're about to get choked
the out.

00:20.619 --> 00:22.354
Wanna get choked out?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.189
You wanna get
choked out, you dumb ?

00:24.190 --> 00:26.091
Then, in the new
citizen lunch challenge...

00:26.092 --> 00:29.227
First team to complete serving

00:29.228 --> 00:31.596
their side of the dining room
wins the challenge.

00:31.597 --> 00:33.264
The red team put
aside their differences...

00:33.265 --> 00:34.766
We got this.
Teamwork, all right?

00:34.767 --> 00:36.301
Come on, guys.
Come on.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.569
Handing the blue team...

00:37.570 --> 00:39.971
The ground beef is raw.
It's raw!

00:39.972 --> 00:42.340
Another crushing defeat...

00:42.341 --> 00:44.809
Congratulations, ladies.
Well done.

00:44.810 --> 00:46.945
Leading chef
Ramsay to ask a question.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.814
Where is the leader
in the blue team?

00:49.815 --> 00:51.182
I'm taking it over, chef.

00:51.183 --> 00:53.218
<i>I need to see it.
Yes, chef.</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:55.620
But Patrick
quickly rubbed his team

00:55.621 --> 00:56.955
the wrong way.

00:56.956 --> 00:58.623
I wouldn't go so high on these.
I'm not.

00:58.624 --> 01:00.825
I just want him to know
that he sucks.

01:01.827 --> 01:03.661
Step off.

01:03.662 --> 01:05.764
During dinner service, Royce...

01:05.765 --> 01:07.665
<i>The risotto is delicious.
Keep it going, Royce.</i>

01:07.666 --> 01:08.733
Yes, chef.

01:08.734 --> 01:10.168
And Clemenza...

01:10.169 --> 01:11.770
They're cooked beautifully.

01:11.771 --> 01:12.837
Pulled the blue team together,

01:12.838 --> 01:14.406
while the red team...

01:14.407 --> 01:15.807
It's like canned soup.

01:15.808 --> 01:17.342
Came apart at the seams.

01:17.343 --> 01:18.843
<i>off with you.</i>

01:18.844 --> 01:19.844
<i>Just touch that.</i>

01:19.845 --> 01:21.046
They're stone cold.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.347
I'm sorry, chef.

01:22.348 --> 01:25.050
Brutal.

01:25.051 --> 01:27.052
Ugh! I didn't realize they
shrank down that much, chef.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.520
It's a bit like your brain.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.455
This disappears.

01:30.456 --> 01:32.157
Briana, just cook
the fish right.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.992
Their performance earned

01:33.993 --> 01:35.493
a special invitation.

01:35.494 --> 01:37.395
<i>Eight of you,
off out of here.</i>

01:37.396 --> 01:39.297
Get out! Out!

01:39.298 --> 01:40.465
<i>And one more thing.</i>

01:40.466 --> 01:41.966
Get out!

01:41.967 --> 01:43.802
The dinner service ended

01:43.803 --> 01:46.571
with the men earning
their first victory...

01:46.572 --> 01:47.572
That's right, baby.

01:47.573 --> 01:48.740
Good work.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.208
Forcing the red team

01:50.209 --> 01:51.376
to nominate two of their own.

01:51.377 --> 01:52.644
They chose...

01:52.645 --> 01:53.745
Briana.

01:53.746 --> 01:55.647
<i>And...
Barbie.</i>

01:55.648 --> 01:57.449
But chef Ramsay
surprised everyone.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.452
Roshni, get your ass over here.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.820
But in the end, it was...

02:01.821 --> 02:03.621
Briana.

02:03.622 --> 02:05.190
Who became
the latest casualty

02:05.191 --> 02:07.125
<i>in Hell's Kitchen</i>

02:07.126 --> 02:10.428
and watched her dream
of running Gordon Ramsay Steak

02:10.429 --> 02:12.697
at Paris, Las Vegas
disappear.

Piss off.

03:18.664 --> 03:21.065
I'm proud, man.

03:21.066 --> 03:23.668
We actually finished
dinner service,

03:23.669 --> 03:28.339
which is a monumental shift
in momentum for us.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.308
It's on like Donkey Kong,
bitches.

03:30.309 --> 03:31.809
The only reason that we made it
through that service

03:31.810 --> 03:33.578
was we fought.

03:33.579 --> 03:35.480
We needed this.
The blue team needed this.

03:35.481 --> 03:36.848
You know, the girls are down
one member now.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.383
We ain't stopping.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.552
Let's win
the challenge tomorrow, man.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.554
While the blue
team celebrates their victory,

03:42.555 --> 03:44.455
the red team's
Tiffany and Kimmie...

03:44.456 --> 03:46.824
Kidding me. Stuck with that
bitch again.

03:46.825 --> 03:49.194
Blame one
person for their defeat.

03:49.195 --> 03:51.229
The wrong person
went home tonight, dude.

03:51.230 --> 03:54.299
The only person dragging
the team down is Barbie.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.700
Oh, God.

03:55.701 --> 03:57.635
Bitch is still
here.

03:57.636 --> 03:59.637
It's driving me insane.

03:59.638 --> 04:01.105
She sucks.

04:01.106 --> 04:03.675
There's nothing good about her.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.210
After a string

04:05.211 --> 04:06.311
of unreliable,
inconsistent services

04:06.312 --> 04:08.379
by both teams,

04:08.380 --> 04:10.114
chef Ramsay wants
the chefs up early.

04:10.115 --> 04:11.883
And he's relying

04:11.884 --> 04:14.452
on man's best friend
to make sure it happens.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.558
<i>Everybody get up!</i>

04:20.559 --> 04:23.561
<i>Come on. Dogs?</i>

04:23.562 --> 04:25.430
What is this? Dogs?

04:25.431 --> 04:27.265
Come on, everybody.
Get up.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.234
Let's go.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.035
<i>Everybody up.
Grab an outfit.</i>

04:31.036 --> 04:33.638
Get dressed,
and we'll see you downstairs.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.609
Yee-haw!

04:37.610 --> 04:39.143
I'm old, I'm Donald,

04:39.144 --> 04:41.179
and it looks like
I'm going to a farm.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.347
I'm old MacDonald.

04:42.348 --> 04:43.581
Git 'er done.

04:43.582 --> 04:45.516
What is this?

04:50.990 --> 04:53.358
I see a big, fenced-in pen
and chef Ramsay

04:53.359 --> 04:54.993
just kinda standing there,
waiting on us to get in.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.294
Let's go!

04:56.295 --> 04:58.296
I'm like, "hell, yeah.
I'm from Tennessee.

04:58.297 --> 05:00.465
I'm totally down
to get dirty and be country."

05:00.466 --> 05:01.666
Right. Good morning.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.201
Morning, chef.

05:03.202 --> 05:04.902
<i>For your next challenge,</i>

05:04.903 --> 05:07.372
I want you to get really close
to your ingredients.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.840
<i>But, trust me,</i>

05:08.841 --> 05:11.676
you will not be shopping
for your ingredients.

05:11.677 --> 05:12.710
Oh, no.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.648
<i>Here we go.</i>

05:16.649 --> 05:18.583
<i>Here they come.</i>

05:18.584 --> 05:20.485
Holy crap.
That's a lotta damn sheep.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.687
I'm like, "oh, boy,
what are we doing here?"

05:22.688 --> 05:24.589
<i>Wow.</i>

05:24.590 --> 05:27.425
There we are. Okay.
Listen carefully.

05:27.426 --> 05:30.928
I want each team
to make four lamb dishes.

05:30.929 --> 05:33.298
In the pen here,
there are about 30 sheep.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.199
<i>Look carefully,
because they have</i>

05:35.200 --> 05:37.335
<i>all the ingredients
you will be using</i>

05:37.336 --> 05:41.673
written across their bodies
and on their collars.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.908
One member from each team
will go into the pen.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.677
Grab that ingredient.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.912
<i>After that, you run back,
and you tag</i>

05:47.913 --> 05:49.514
the next member of your team.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.349
<i>Basically, hurry up</i>

05:51.350 --> 05:54.719
and grab as many ingredients
as possible.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.120
Yes, chef!

05:56.121 --> 05:57.221
I was like, "oh, sweet."

05:57.222 --> 05:58.222
Not afraid of farm animals.

05:58.223 --> 05:59.824
I'm like, "I'm ready
to tackle 'em.

05:59.825 --> 06:01.025
Let's go."

06:01.026 --> 06:02.760
Red team, blue team,
five minutes

06:02.761 --> 06:03.828
to get as many ingredients
as you can.

06:03.829 --> 06:04.829
<i>Are you ready?</i>

06:04.830 --> 06:06.297
Yes, chef!

06:06.298 --> 06:08.032
Time starts now.
Off you go! Let's go!

06:08.033 --> 06:10.101
In this challenge,

06:10.102 --> 06:12.103
the teams must race to catch
as many sheep collars

06:12.104 --> 06:13.104
as they can.

06:13.105 --> 06:14.706
Potatoes!

06:14.707 --> 06:17.175
The chefs will
have to think on their feet,

06:17.176 --> 06:18.910
while attempting
to stay on their feet,

06:18.911 --> 06:20.111
in order to have
enough ingredients

06:20.112 --> 06:21.779
to make four lamb dishes.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.348
<i>Spinach!
Come on, Barbie! Run!</i>

06:23.349 --> 06:24.782
Avocado!

06:24.783 --> 06:26.951
<i>Three minutes to go.</i>

06:26.952 --> 06:29.387
While some of the
chefs, like Robyn and Patrick,

06:29.388 --> 06:31.356
are not afraid
to get down and dirty...

06:31.357 --> 06:32.824
Ugh!

06:32.825 --> 06:34.359
Sheep whisperer Clemenza

06:34.360 --> 06:35.493
has a different approach.

06:35.494 --> 06:36.527
That's endives!

06:36.528 --> 06:37.762
Yeah! Yeah!

06:37.763 --> 06:40.231
I'm eatin' dirt,
and he's walking up.

06:40.232 --> 06:41.699
They didn't move for him.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.368
And Roshni's strategy

06:43.369 --> 06:44.836
seems to be catching
more dirt...

06:44.837 --> 06:46.337
Jump! Jump!

06:46.338 --> 06:47.939
Than sheep.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.974
With time running down...

06:49.975 --> 06:51.876
One minute to go!

06:51.877 --> 06:53.678
Who wants it?
Who wants it?

06:53.679 --> 06:55.413
Both teams scramble

06:55.414 --> 06:56.481
to get as many ingredients
as they can.

06:56.482 --> 06:57.615
<i>Keep it going!
Keep it going!</i>

06:57.616 --> 06:59.650
Mustard!

06:59.651 --> 07:01.452
15 seconds to go.

07:01.453 --> 07:03.287
Barbs, you got one?
Yogurt!

07:05.591 --> 07:08.593
<i>Three... Two... One...</i>

07:08.594 --> 07:10.294
And stop!

07:10.295 --> 07:11.829
Beautiful. Beautiful!

07:11.830 --> 07:13.998
We got one less item
than the women did.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.366
But you know what? I think
we got some good ingredients.

07:15.367 --> 07:16.667
Let's get back
to Hell's Kitchen.

07:16.668 --> 07:17.969
<i>You'll get changed,</i>

07:17.970 --> 07:19.437
and I'll see you
back in the kitchen.

07:19.438 --> 07:20.972
Men are gonna win today, man.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.340
We haven't won a challenge yet.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.108
We're going for it, man.
There's no stopping us today.

07:24.109 --> 07:25.543
It's a blue day, right?

07:25.544 --> 07:27.578
♪ It's a blue day

07:27.579 --> 07:29.614
After a quick
change back at Hell's Kitchen,

07:29.615 --> 07:31.416
the chefs gather for the second
part of the challenge.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.351
Okay, red team, blue team,
let's go.

07:33.352 --> 07:34.519
<i>I want each team</i>

07:34.520 --> 07:36.521
to make four stunning dishes.

07:36.522 --> 07:37.522
<i>A lamb steak,</i>

07:37.523 --> 07:39.357
rack of lamb,

07:39.358 --> 07:42.026
lamb chop, and ground lamb.

07:42.027 --> 07:43.961
Your 45 minutes starts from now.
Let's go.

07:43.962 --> 07:45.696
With the clock counting down,

07:45.697 --> 07:47.799
the teams split into pairs
and quickly divide up

07:47.800 --> 07:49.267
their selected ingredients.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.835
I'm gonna start making us
a crust

07:50.836 --> 07:52.236
for the outer side of the lamb.

07:52.237 --> 07:53.938
All we gotta do is cook
that lamb perfectly.

07:53.939 --> 07:55.873
While Barbie and Robyn

07:55.874 --> 07:57.241
have already started cooking
their rack of lamb...

07:57.242 --> 07:58.609
Let's go, guys.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.178
Over in the blue kitchen...

08:00.179 --> 08:00.578
And what are you doing
to the lamb?

08:00.579 --> 08:01.646
Talk to me.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.080
Justin and Guy are still

08:03.081 --> 08:03.981
coming up with a game plan.

08:03.982 --> 08:05.183
<i>You can cook it, and I'll plate</i>

08:05.184 --> 08:06.451
while you finish it off.

08:06.452 --> 08:07.485
Just gotta be on top of time,

08:07.486 --> 08:09.086
and we'll be fine.

08:09.087 --> 08:10.488
Ah!

08:10.489 --> 08:11.889
<i>Agh!</i>

08:11.890 --> 08:12.957
<i>What's wrong?</i>

08:14.793 --> 08:16.427
All of the sudden, I look up,

08:16.428 --> 08:17.762
and Guy, he's running around
yelling.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.264
Medic, please.

08:20.265 --> 08:22.433
I'm kind of nervous for him
'cause I'm thinking

08:22.434 --> 08:24.135
dude must be cut pretty bad.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.269
Yeah, just wrap it up for me,
and I'm...

08:25.270 --> 08:27.271
I gotta go back.

08:27.272 --> 08:29.106
I'm like, "you know what?
It's not that bad.

08:29.107 --> 08:30.808
I'm fine.

08:30.809 --> 08:32.610
You can't break
down like a little bitch.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.544
Hey, Guy, when you yelled,

08:34.546 --> 08:36.547
<i>it sounded like
you'd just been circumcised</i>

08:36.548 --> 08:38.015
without anesthetic,
for sake.

08:38.015 --> 08:39.650
<i>A big boy like you... come on.
Yes, chef.</i>

08:39.650 --> 08:40.551
Pick it up, Justin.

08:40.552 --> 08:41.818
Yes, chef.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.321
While Justin covers

08:43.322 --> 08:44.188
for his injured teammate,

08:44.188 --> 08:45.623
over in the red kitchen...

08:45.624 --> 08:46.991
I just really wanted
to do a curry.

08:46.992 --> 08:47.925
You wanna do a curry sauce?

08:47.926 --> 08:49.293
We'll do a curry sauce.

08:49.294 --> 08:50.261
Kimmie takes a risk

08:50.262 --> 08:51.863
on the ground lamb.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.798
He hears curry, he's gonna think
it's me, and it's not.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.867
Memphis girl doing curry, guys.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.201
Twenty minutes, let's go.

08:57.202 --> 08:58.369
Rack of lamb is in the oven.

08:58.370 --> 08:59.637
Don't you think it's too early?

08:59.638 --> 09:00.571
Don't overcook the
rack of lamb.

09:00.572 --> 09:01.706
Yeah, we have 20 minutes.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.341
Get it out.

09:03.342 --> 09:06.577
Rack of lamb.
It takes a long time to cook.

09:06.578 --> 09:09.247
But this is also
a team challenge.

09:09.248 --> 09:10.948
You gotta listen
to your other teammates, too.

09:10.949 --> 09:11.916
<i>Behind.
When we're done,</i>

09:11.917 --> 09:13.584
we'll hit it
with a tiny bit of salt.

09:13.585 --> 09:15.319
I don't wanna salt
anything anymore.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.821
I knew what I was doing
with the lamb.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.155
I don't wanna overthink it.
No, I know.

09:18.156 --> 09:19.490
I'm just... let's run through
one more time.

09:19.491 --> 09:21.158
I'm better than all these guys.

09:21.159 --> 09:22.293
We're gonna knock this
out of the park.

09:22.294 --> 09:23.461
Let's go, ladies.
Last minute.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.062
<i>We're good.
Let's go.</i>

09:25.063 --> 09:26.631
No, that white stuff
is not cooked.

09:26.632 --> 09:27.865
We're not good.
Okay, well...

09:27.866 --> 09:29.233
We're out of time.

09:29.234 --> 09:30.835
I knew it should've stayed
in there.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.036
I was told to take it out
by my team,

09:32.037 --> 09:32.970
and I should've listened
to myself.

09:32.971 --> 09:34.672
But when it's a team event,

09:34.673 --> 09:36.207
you have to listen
to what your teammates say.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.608
15 seconds to go.

09:37.609 --> 09:40.778
We're racking up.

09:40.779 --> 09:42.179
<i>Pissed.
Ten.</i>

09:42.180 --> 09:43.848
Guy, gotta cut it.
Now?

09:43.849 --> 09:45.683
You gotta get the sauce.
Get the sauce, get the sauce.

09:45.684 --> 09:46.817
Grill up, rack up.
Let's go.

09:46.818 --> 09:48.619
<i>Just put it on.
Five... Four...</i>

09:48.620 --> 09:50.488
<i>Get it up,
get it up, get it up.</i>

09:50.489 --> 09:52.823
One... And stop.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.260
Okay.

09:56.261 --> 09:57.828
Is everybody happy
with their dishes?

09:57.829 --> 09:58.663
Yes, chef!

09:58.664 --> 10:00.097
<i>Good.</i>

10:00.098 --> 10:01.566
Let's start off with the battle
of the lamb chop.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.533
<i>Let's go.</i>

10:02.534 --> 10:03.968
Let's go, Clemenza.

10:03.969 --> 10:05.670
Up first, Tiffany and Danielle

10:05.671 --> 10:07.838
will face off
against Clemenza and Don.

10:07.839 --> 10:09.607
Tiffany, give me something
inspirational, please.

10:09.608 --> 10:12.143
Yes, chef.
I have a anchovy...

10:12.144 --> 10:13.578
and pine-nut-crusted
lamb chop...

10:13.579 --> 10:15.446
<i>Uh-huh?
With a souffle.</i>

10:15.447 --> 10:17.148
You did a souffle?

10:17.149 --> 10:19.183
As soon as she said souffle,
I was like, "hell, yeah.

10:19.184 --> 10:20.751
We got the point."

10:20.752 --> 10:22.653
No way in the world
that she made souffle so fast.

10:22.654 --> 10:24.755
<i>Why you doing a souffle?</i>

10:24.756 --> 10:26.958
Um, I thought it would go nice.

10:29.761 --> 10:31.295
Mm.

10:31.296 --> 10:32.296
It's delicious.

10:32.297 --> 10:33.798
Thank you, chef.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.333
<i>Trust me. I'd pay a lot
of money for that.</i>

10:35.334 --> 10:36.334
<i>Good job.
Well done.</i>

10:36.335 --> 10:37.468
Thank you.

10:37.469 --> 10:38.836
Clemenza.

10:38.837 --> 10:40.671
<i>We have an herb-crusted
grilled lamb</i>

10:40.672 --> 10:42.673
<i>with a roasted cauliflower
feta melt.</i>

10:42.674 --> 10:44.609
Lamb chop looks like
Steven Tyler's earlobe.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.177
<i>I don't need the feather</i>

10:46.178 --> 10:47.278
and all the bits
of crap with it.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.746
You can take that back.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.751
The mustard and the feta
just melts in your mouth.

10:53.752 --> 10:55.686
Delicious.
Thank you, chef.

10:55.687 --> 10:59.290
Very tough one.
A very tough one to decide.

10:59.291 --> 11:02.526
The point goes to... pfft.

11:02.527 --> 11:04.929
Point goes to both of you.
Congratulations.

11:06.632 --> 11:08.633
Both teams are
off to an impressive start,

11:08.634 --> 11:09.800
and the score is tied.

11:09.801 --> 11:10.968
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

11:10.969 --> 11:12.303
Next, battle of the ground lamb.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.572
Now it's time
for Patrick's lamb sausage

11:14.573 --> 11:16.107
to go head to head

11:16.108 --> 11:17.642
with Roshni and Kimmie's
curry creation.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.343
I'm real nervous

11:19.344 --> 11:21.545
because it's the first time I've
ever done a curry.

11:22.814 --> 11:24.982
<i>This is lamb kibbeh</i>

11:24.983 --> 11:26.717
on a bottom
of a coconut curry sauce.

11:26.718 --> 11:28.085
<i>And the idea, of course,</i>

11:28.086 --> 11:29.553
was drawing from your roots?

11:29.554 --> 11:31.822
Actually, the curry sauce
was made by Kimmie.

11:31.823 --> 11:33.491
She wanted to try something
she never did before, so...

11:33.492 --> 11:36.193
<i>A coconut curry sauce
for the first time.</i>

11:36.194 --> 11:37.628
Yes, chef.

11:37.629 --> 11:41.499
So both of you now
are using me as your guinea pig.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.734
Mm.

11:43.735 --> 11:44.769
It's delicious.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.270
Thank you, chef.

11:46.271 --> 11:47.605
Yes!

11:47.606 --> 11:49.206
<i>I'm glad today
I've been your guinea pig</i>

11:49.207 --> 11:50.074
because that's delicious.

11:50.075 --> 11:51.442
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

11:51.443 --> 11:53.544
Patrick, going solo,
on your own.

11:53.545 --> 11:55.479
What is that?
It's an appetizer, chef,

11:55.480 --> 11:57.982
<i>of, uh,
lamb and fennel sausage.</i>

11:57.983 --> 11:59.717
Mm.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.219
My presentation
is so much better.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.655
It's a very simple,
elegant dish.

12:04.656 --> 12:06.323
And I think I'm gonna get us
a point.

12:06.324 --> 12:07.992
Do you know what?
It's creative.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.560
<i>I like the combination.
Thank you, chef.</i>

12:09.561 --> 12:10.928
I mean, you've got two
very tasty dishes.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.199
However, there's one dish
that has the edge

12:15.200 --> 12:17.001
on the seasoning.

12:18.303 --> 12:20.004
Congratulations, Roshni.
Well done.

12:20.005 --> 12:21.972
<i>Thank you, chef.
Well done.</i>

12:21.973 --> 12:24.341
This Memphis bitch
made a curry.

12:24.342 --> 12:26.243
Thanks to Kimmie
and Roshni's curry gamble,

12:26.244 --> 12:28.179
the women have the lead.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.581
Come forward with the rack
of lamb, please... let's go.

12:30.582 --> 12:32.116
Now it's Barbie
and Robyn's rack of lamb

12:32.117 --> 12:34.485
versus Justin and Guy's.

12:34.486 --> 12:35.553
Barbie, what is that?

12:35.554 --> 12:37.088
We made a rack of lamb

12:37.089 --> 12:39.657
<i>with a parsnip puree
with braised leeks.</i>

12:46.498 --> 12:48.833
The lamb is raw.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.035
I'd like to eat that,
but you know, I've still got

12:51.036 --> 12:52.436
four children to look after.
I mean, that's raw.

12:52.437 --> 12:53.904
<i>Robyn.
Yes, chef.</i>

12:53.905 --> 12:55.406
<i>It's raw!
I know, chef.</i>

12:55.407 --> 12:57.108
I put it in the oven.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.576
<i>It should've stayed in there
a little bit longer.</i>

12:58.577 --> 12:59.877
That's all I'm saying.

13:01.513 --> 13:02.713
, man.

13:02.714 --> 13:05.082
<i>Justin, give me something.</i>

13:05.083 --> 13:07.551
I have a grilled rack of lamb,
roasted garlic and basil puree,

13:07.552 --> 13:10.321
<i>and turnips three ways.</i>

13:10.322 --> 13:11.822
The dish works.
Congratulations.

13:11.823 --> 13:13.324
To the blue team, good job.

13:13.325 --> 13:14.792
<i>Yeah!
Yeah, baby.</i>

13:14.793 --> 13:16.160
<i>Okay, it all comes down</i>

13:16.161 --> 13:17.628
to the lamb steak.
Let's go.

13:17.629 --> 13:18.863
Come on, Royce.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.064
With the score tied,

13:20.065 --> 13:22.133
Dana and Christina's dish

13:22.134 --> 13:24.502
will battle Royce and Brian's
to determine the winner.

13:24.503 --> 13:25.770
Okay, let's go.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.071
Right, Dana, what is that?

13:27.072 --> 13:28.706
A braised lamb steak.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.407
<i>Mm-hmm. And underneath
is sauteed spinach.</i>

13:30.408 --> 13:31.909
Mm-hmm?

13:31.910 --> 13:33.744
Me and Christina
gotta bring this home.

13:33.745 --> 13:35.446
We have to get this point.

13:35.447 --> 13:38.048
That braising it
was a bold move.

13:38.049 --> 13:39.917
<i>But it worked. That's delicious.
Thank you, chef.</i>

13:39.918 --> 13:41.085
<i>Good job.
Yeah, Dana.</i>

13:41.086 --> 13:42.820
<i>Royce, what is it?</i>

13:42.821 --> 13:44.789
I got something that's gonna
blow your mind, Ramsay.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.190
That's what I got.

13:46.191 --> 13:48.325
We have a marinated
grilled lamb steak

13:48.326 --> 13:51.328
<i>with avocado mousse
and a mixed pepper slaw.</i>

13:51.329 --> 13:52.596
The mousse is delicious.

13:52.597 --> 13:54.198
Thank you.

13:54.199 --> 13:56.133
<i>You don't think of an avocado
mousse with a lamb steak.</i>

13:56.134 --> 13:56.901
<i>However, it works beautifully.</i>

13:56.902 --> 13:58.869
<i>Seasoned perfectly.
Yes.</i>

13:58.870 --> 14:00.504
Um, listen, both of you.
Two very good dishes.

14:00.505 --> 14:02.006
<i>Really good dishes.</i>

14:02.007 --> 14:04.041
Tough one, this one.
Very tough.

14:04.042 --> 14:05.810
I was getting a little nervous,
but at the end of the day,

14:05.811 --> 14:06.944
I did what I had to do.

14:06.945 --> 14:08.245
I made perfection.

14:08.246 --> 14:09.580
Really tough.

14:09.581 --> 14:11.782
Come on, man.
Come on.

14:11.783 --> 14:14.952
The point goes to...

14:18.056 --> 14:19.056
Congratulations...

14:24.533 --> 14:26.234
The score is tied

14:26.235 --> 14:28.136
in the creativity with lamb
challenge.

14:28.137 --> 14:30.238
It all comes down
to Dana and Christina's dish

14:30.239 --> 14:31.773
and Royce and Brian's.

14:31.774 --> 14:33.007
Really tough.

14:33.008 --> 14:35.076
Come on, man.
Come on.

14:35.077 --> 14:36.344
The point goes to...

14:39.448 --> 14:40.961
Congratulations...

14:40.962 --> 14:41.649
Blue team.

14:41.650 --> 14:42.884
Yes!
Yeah!

14:42.885 --> 14:44.485
Yeah, baby.

14:44.486 --> 14:46.854
Holy ,
we won a challenge.

14:46.855 --> 14:49.557
Honestly, I feel like
I just gave birth.

14:49.558 --> 14:50.992
And I'm so proud.

14:50.993 --> 14:52.493
Good job, brother.

14:52.494 --> 14:54.596
<i>Good job, guys.
.</i>

14:54.597 --> 14:57.031
The dishes across the board
were phenomenal,

14:57.032 --> 14:58.666
but there was one dish
that stood out

14:58.667 --> 15:00.435
<i>for all of the wrong reasons.</i>

15:00.436 --> 15:03.304
Robyn and Barbie, what in
the hell were you both doing?

15:03.305 --> 15:05.306
I seared it.
I put it in the oven.

15:05.307 --> 15:07.075
That was the first thing I did
'cause I knew it took longest.

15:07.076 --> 15:10.011
But I heard other...
other whispers in the kitchen

15:10.012 --> 15:11.913
<i>said don't up the lamb.</i>

15:11.914 --> 15:14.082
So I...
doesn't matter, chef.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.117
<i>I should've left it
in there longer.</i>

15:16.118 --> 15:17.652
You're responsible, accountable
for what you put out.

15:17.653 --> 15:20.388
That's what I said.
I'm responsible for the dish.

15:20.389 --> 15:22.323
I'm just tired
of listening to people.

15:22.324 --> 15:24.025
I'm here for myself.
It's a competition.

15:24.026 --> 15:27.061
I'm here to win.
everyone else now.

15:27.062 --> 15:28.529
Men, congratulations.

15:28.530 --> 15:30.164
Thank you, chef.

15:30.165 --> 15:33.101
<i>I've arranged a stunning
VIP trip</i>

15:33.102 --> 15:34.235
for a day at the races.

15:34.236 --> 15:36.104
Yes!

15:36.105 --> 15:37.438
I'm ready to go.

15:37.439 --> 15:38.740
I love the racetrack.

15:38.741 --> 15:40.174
Can we get some cash to gamble?

15:41.510 --> 15:43.077
Here's $100.
Off you go.

15:43.078 --> 15:45.313
<i>Keep the change.
I hope you win.</i>

15:45.314 --> 15:47.048
<i>Thank you, chef.
Good luck.</i>

15:47.049 --> 15:48.149
I want that going on the horse,
not hot dogs.

15:49.485 --> 15:50.885
You got it.

15:50.886 --> 15:52.920
Get ready, because your
chauffeur and limousine

15:52.921 --> 15:54.122
<i>is about to pull up.</i>

15:54.123 --> 15:55.356
Well done.
Off you go.

15:55.357 --> 15:56.591
Thanks, chef.
Thank you, chef.

15:56.592 --> 15:57.592
<i>Congratulations.</i>

15:57.593 --> 15:58.826
Okay, ladies.

15:58.827 --> 15:59.861
Oh, no.

15:59.862 --> 16:01.229
<i>Trust me.</i>

16:01.230 --> 16:02.897
You have a lot of hard work
ahead of you.

16:02.898 --> 16:04.332
<i>First off,</i>

16:04.333 --> 16:05.333
all those sheep...

16:06.669 --> 16:08.169
They can't go back
to the farm yard

16:08.170 --> 16:09.337
with all that paint over them.

16:09.338 --> 16:10.772
<i>So you'll be cleaning
their butts.</i>

16:10.773 --> 16:12.006
God.

16:12.007 --> 16:14.442
<i>Hell's Kitchen is open tonight.</i>

16:14.443 --> 16:16.644
<i>So I want the kitchens</i>

16:16.645 --> 16:18.479
cleaned and prepped as well.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.580
<i>Got it?</i>

16:19.581 --> 16:20.615
Yes, chef.

16:20.616 --> 16:21.816
Get cleaning.

16:21.817 --> 16:23.251
Thanks, Robyn and Barbie,

16:23.252 --> 16:25.153
for making us do
this punishment.

16:25.154 --> 16:26.988
<i>Ba-a-a-a-a.</i>

16:26.989 --> 16:29.957
If it weren't for you
guys up your lamb,

16:29.958 --> 16:31.793
we could've been out
on a reward right now.

16:31.794 --> 16:33.328
I don't want to hurt it.

16:34.496 --> 16:36.230
Limo's here.
Oh, girls.

16:36.231 --> 16:38.032
<i>* Red team had a little lamb</i>

16:38.033 --> 16:39.634
Have a good day.
* e-i-e-i-o

16:39.635 --> 16:41.703
There you go, guys.
Yep.

16:43.238 --> 16:44.472
<i>Salud.</i>

16:44.473 --> 16:46.307
Finally, we won something.

16:46.308 --> 16:47.508
I'm happy.
We're going to have some fun.

16:47.509 --> 16:50.311
It's a great feeling.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.782
Go, champ!

16:54.783 --> 16:56.784
Chef Ramsay
gave me $100 to go gamble.

16:56.785 --> 16:58.553
We picked the horse
that was blue.

16:58.554 --> 16:59.954
Figured blue team, we won.

16:59.955 --> 17:01.522
There's a blue horse.

17:01.523 --> 17:03.057
Let's go with that.
Long shot, right?

17:03.058 --> 17:04.525
<i>Blue.
Go, blue!</i>

17:04.526 --> 17:05.926
I think the odds
are in our favor.

17:05.928 --> 17:07.362
Bring it on, blue!
Come on!

17:12.367 --> 17:14.335
Keep bringing it back!
Bringing it back!

17:14.336 --> 17:16.104
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

17:16.105 --> 17:17.739
We got off to a good start.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.339
Don't worry, don't worry,
don't worry.

17:19.340 --> 17:20.808
<i>Where is he?</i>

17:20.809 --> 17:22.109
<i>Go, go, go, go.</i>

17:22.111 --> 17:23.077
And then bang.

17:24.512 --> 17:26.180
Big blue is in dead last.

17:26.181 --> 17:27.515
You get points for last?

17:29.118 --> 17:31.519
I probably coulda
ran faster than the horse.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.220
Alls you gotta do is, like,
dangle a piece of prosciutto

17:32.221 --> 17:33.688
in front of me.

17:33.689 --> 17:35.957
I woulda ran that race
like there was no tomorrow.

17:35.958 --> 17:36.958
The blue team
may have lost their bet,

17:36.959 --> 17:38.526
but the red team...

17:38.527 --> 17:40.094
<i>Lamb testicles.</i>

17:42.164 --> 17:43.831
May be about
to lose their lunch.

17:43.832 --> 17:45.166
Yes! Whoo!

17:45.167 --> 17:46.667
All right, okay.
Enjoy.

17:46.668 --> 17:47.735
<i>Let's do it.</i>

17:47.736 --> 17:48.903
Cannot eat this.

17:48.904 --> 17:50.938
Come on, quit being
, guys.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.473
Danielle was totally
being a bitch.

17:52.474 --> 17:53.875
Like, come on, Dan.

17:53.876 --> 17:55.376
Just suck it up
and stick the

17:55.377 --> 17:56.611
in your mouth.

17:56.612 --> 17:58.045
I'm already...
I'm on my third, guys.

17:58.046 --> 17:59.347
Like, come on, now.

17:59.348 --> 18:00.314
All right,
maybe that's too many.

18:00.315 --> 18:01.282
No... ugh!

18:03.652 --> 18:06.187
Dude, I can't do it
when you're puking next to me.

18:06.188 --> 18:07.789
I'm sorry!

18:07.790 --> 18:09.857
<i>Look, I'm on number four.
Like, come on, guys.</i>

18:09.858 --> 18:11.292
I'm so happy for you.

18:11.293 --> 18:12.760
She feels like
she's better than me

18:12.761 --> 18:13.728
because she's downing ?

18:13.729 --> 18:15.797
Whoa, first prize for you.

18:15.798 --> 18:17.331
I'm glad you're excited.

18:17.332 --> 18:19.133
Number five.

18:20.235 --> 18:21.636
<i>Whoo!</i>

18:21.637 --> 18:23.104
<i>What day was it?</i>

18:23.105 --> 18:24.672
Blue day.

18:24.673 --> 18:26.407
<i>'Cause every day, we set goals.</i>

18:26.408 --> 18:27.775
We set a goal
to win this challenge.

18:27.776 --> 18:29.477
If we don't focus
right now,

18:29.478 --> 18:31.078
<i>somebody's gonna be going home.</i>

18:31.079 --> 18:33.047
And it's a decision that
I really don't want to make.

18:33.048 --> 18:34.549
I'd rather just
get it done.

18:34.550 --> 18:35.616
I agree.

18:35.617 --> 18:37.084
We're enjoying our reward,

18:37.085 --> 18:38.586
but we know what it's like
to lose.

18:38.587 --> 18:40.455
So we're staying focused
as a team,

18:40.456 --> 18:41.622
and that's reassuring.

18:41.623 --> 18:42.990
To the blue.
Blue, baby!

18:42.991 --> 18:44.492
Blue!

18:44.493 --> 18:46.294
As the
reward unites the men,

18:46.295 --> 18:48.029
back in Hell's Kitchen...

18:48.030 --> 18:49.464
Kimmie, thanks so much
for knocking some of that down.

18:49.465 --> 18:50.198
I was...
I, like, puked it.

18:50.199 --> 18:51.599
You're good.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.935
It's the Barbie dolls
I was worried about.

18:53.936 --> 18:55.636
The punishment is
starting to divide the women.

18:55.637 --> 18:58.272
<i>Why do they care
how much we ate?</i>

18:58.273 --> 18:59.740
<i>I don't know.
'Cause they feel stupid,</i>

18:59.741 --> 19:01.142
'cause they ate so much.

19:01.143 --> 19:04.445
Now it's starting to get cliquey.
Correct.

19:04.446 --> 19:06.414
She's always in a bad mood
lately.

19:06.415 --> 19:08.249
<i>She's just bitchy.
Yeah.</i>

19:08.250 --> 19:10.184
I don't understand where
her attitude is coming from.

19:10.185 --> 19:12.286
But I'm sure as hell not gonna
walk on eggshells.

19:12.287 --> 19:13.588
What, do you think,
'cause you're 500 pounds,

19:13.589 --> 19:15.022
I'm not gonna say anything
back to you?

19:15.023 --> 19:17.158
Kimmie, like, is there
something I did to you today

19:17.159 --> 19:19.060
that you need to give me
an attitude?

19:19.061 --> 19:21.062
'Cause just say it.
Like, is there something I did?

19:21.063 --> 19:23.197
Or you just feel like
giving me an attitude today?

19:23.198 --> 19:24.298
I just feel like giving you
an attitude today.

19:24.299 --> 19:25.533
Yeah, that's... that's mature.

19:25.534 --> 19:27.168
You know, I did eat
five testicles,

19:27.169 --> 19:28.936
and you didn't...
couldn't even get down one.

19:28.937 --> 19:30.771
Dude, and you just feel stupid
'cause you ate five,

19:30.772 --> 19:31.839
and it didn't even
matter.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.474
All right, let's not argue, okay?
I'm not.

19:33.475 --> 19:35.176
She's starting
with me today.

19:35.177 --> 19:37.044
Just relax, Dani.
Back on this side!

19:37.045 --> 19:39.313
No! I'm always quiet,
and now I'm pissed off!

19:44.938 --> 19:47.005
The red team
lost the lamb challenge.

19:47.006 --> 19:48.607
You know, I did eat
five testicles,

19:48.608 --> 19:50.609
and you didn't even
get down one.

19:50.610 --> 19:51.944
And after a
long and punishing day,

19:51.945 --> 19:54.179
which included
a lamb testicle lunch...

19:54.180 --> 19:55.814
She's starting
with me today!

19:55.815 --> 19:57.950
Everyone is getting
a little testy.

19:57.951 --> 19:59.084
Dani, back on this side!

19:59.085 --> 20:01.587
No! I'm always quiet,
and now I'm pissed off!

20:01.588 --> 20:03.388
I respect you,

20:03.389 --> 20:05.190
but if you with me,
you're gonna hear my mouth.

20:06.226 --> 20:07.826
Dude, just get the out

20:07.827 --> 20:09.094
of my kitchen
if you're gonna act like that.

20:09.095 --> 20:10.129
, I didn't start it.

20:10.130 --> 20:11.864
I-I under... okay.

20:11.865 --> 20:13.565
What, she weighs 5 million
pounds, I'm gonna shut up?

20:13.566 --> 20:15.667
This is when it gets ugly.

20:15.668 --> 20:18.070
With tensions running
high in the red kitchen,

20:18.071 --> 20:19.938
the men return
from their day at the races

20:19.939 --> 20:22.407
and quickly change
for dinner service.

20:22.408 --> 20:24.309
We got momentum going
right now.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.445
We've got a win from
last night's dinner service.

20:26.446 --> 20:28.580
We've got today's challenge.

20:28.581 --> 20:32.584
So the blue team is going to win
tonight... Period.

20:32.585 --> 20:34.686
Let's go, ladies.
We're opening in an hour, yeah?

20:34.687 --> 20:35.921
Yes, chef.

20:35.922 --> 20:37.222
<i>James.
Yes, chef?</i>

20:37.223 --> 20:38.457
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Let's go.

20:38.458 --> 20:39.491
Yes, chef.

20:42.495 --> 20:44.095
♪

20:49.235 --> 20:50.869
As Hell's Kitchen opens

20:50.870 --> 20:51.870
for the fourth
dinner service...

20:51.871 --> 20:54.506
Could I start with the risotto?

20:54.507 --> 20:55.908
The lamb looks good, too.

20:55.909 --> 20:56.942
The women are hoping

20:56.943 --> 20:58.443
to pull it together...

20:58.444 --> 20:59.378
You need to communicate
with me, too, Dani.

20:59.379 --> 21:00.646
Okay.

21:00.647 --> 21:02.681
While the men are a tight unit.

21:02.682 --> 21:04.116
We can do this.

21:04.117 --> 21:05.684
A really tight unit.

21:05.685 --> 21:07.653
I got your back.
You got my back.

21:07.654 --> 21:10.255
<i>I know.
I love you.</i>

21:10.256 --> 21:11.590
Ladies, good luck.

21:11.591 --> 21:14.059
<i>Four covers, table 34.
Away now.</i>

21:14.060 --> 21:15.327
Three risotto, one scallops.

21:15.328 --> 21:16.128
Yes, chef!

21:16.129 --> 21:17.329
Let's go.

21:17.330 --> 21:18.597
What did he say?

21:18.598 --> 21:19.865
<i>I didn't hear him.</i>

21:19.866 --> 21:21.800
I needed to repeat it.

21:21.801 --> 21:25.037
<i>I mean, I'm sorry.
Three risotto, one scallop!</i>

21:25.038 --> 21:27.272
Ah, .
Are you serious, Danielle?

21:27.273 --> 21:29.908
You're starting to get
that dumb blonde look going.

21:29.909 --> 21:30.909
This is not good.

21:30.910 --> 21:32.110
Three risotto!

21:32.111 --> 21:33.278
It's coming, chef.
It's coming.

21:33.279 --> 21:34.646
Speed up!

21:34.647 --> 21:36.315
Behind.

21:38.518 --> 21:40.485
<i>Hey, all of you,
come here.</i>

21:40.486 --> 21:42.554
Taste that. Yeah.
Just taste it.

21:42.555 --> 21:44.690
<i>Taste it.
Yeah, how does that taste?</i>

21:44.691 --> 21:46.925
<i>Uh, undercooked
and not seasoned.</i>

21:46.926 --> 21:48.126
<i>Yeah, how is that, you?</i>

21:48.127 --> 21:48.927
Tell me.

21:48.928 --> 21:50.495
I just... I spit it out, chef.

21:50.496 --> 21:51.697
<i>Oh, really.
It was undercooked, chef.</i>

21:51.698 --> 21:53.065
I'm sorry.

21:53.066 --> 21:56.368
So you're rushing.
You're cooking bland food.

21:56.369 --> 21:57.736
<i>It's coming, chef.
Come on, Danielle.</i>

21:57.737 --> 21:58.737
It's coming, chef.

21:58.738 --> 22:01.039
Come on, Danielle!
Concentrate.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.041
Somebody taste this.
Tell me if it's veg.

22:03.042 --> 22:05.444
It tastes a little Asian.

22:05.445 --> 22:07.980
While Danielle
starts over on the risotto,

22:07.981 --> 22:09.414
over in the blue kitchen,

22:09.415 --> 22:11.717
it's up to Justin on appetizers

22:11.718 --> 22:13.051
and Brian on fish

22:13.052 --> 22:14.753
to get the men off
to a good start.

22:14.754 --> 22:15.854
<i>Two risotto, two cioppini.</i>

22:15.855 --> 22:17.155
Hurry up, please, guys.

22:17.156 --> 22:18.891
<i>Yes, chef! Let's go.</i>

22:18.892 --> 22:20.325
I don't need anybody else
to talk but me and Brian.

22:20.326 --> 22:21.560
<i>I got the lead
on the apps, guys.</i>

22:21.561 --> 22:22.728
Good, I love it.

22:22.729 --> 22:24.229
<i>Love it, love it, love it.
Let's go.</i>

22:24.230 --> 22:26.331
Cioppini, walking right now.

22:26.332 --> 22:31.036
Let's go, one risotto.
Behind you, chef.

22:31.037 --> 22:34.406
up, guys.

22:34.407 --> 22:36.208
This salmon's raw.
Back in the pan!

22:36.209 --> 22:37.209
Yes, chef.

22:37.210 --> 22:39.511
<i>Hurry up!
Yes, chef.</i>

22:39.512 --> 22:40.779
Come on,
you're holding me up now.

22:40.780 --> 22:42.314
<i>Coming, baby.</i>

22:42.315 --> 22:43.682
Dude, finish your cioppino.

22:43.683 --> 22:44.917
Not complicated.

22:44.918 --> 22:46.652
You have two little pieces
of fish to pan sear.

22:46.653 --> 22:49.388
Whoopty
do-da day, man.

22:49.389 --> 22:50.722
<i>Hey, need that cioppino.</i>

22:50.723 --> 22:53.225
<i>Brian, let's go.
Got it.</i>

22:53.226 --> 22:55.794
While the blue team
waits on Brian and his fish,

22:55.795 --> 22:58.797
the red team is still
waiting on Danielle.

22:58.798 --> 23:00.232
How long on the risotto?

23:00.233 --> 23:01.366
It's almost ready.

23:01.367 --> 23:02.567
How much?
I need to know.

23:02.568 --> 23:03.902
I need to drop the calamari.

23:03.903 --> 23:05.837
I need to drop the calamari,
Danielle.

23:05.838 --> 23:07.439
<i>All right, drop the calamari.
Go ahead.</i>

23:07.440 --> 23:09.207
Come on, talk to me, guys.

23:09.208 --> 23:10.409
Hurry up!

23:10.410 --> 23:12.177
<i>I'm going up, okay?</i>

23:12.178 --> 23:14.279
the spaghetti and risotto.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.415
Communicate,
you dumb bitch!

23:16.416 --> 23:19.518
You ready, garnish?
We're ready.

23:19.519 --> 23:21.353
<i>What are you doing?</i>

23:21.354 --> 23:23.055
<i>Waiting on garnish,
waiting on garnish.</i>

23:23.056 --> 23:24.189
It's up to you.

23:24.190 --> 23:25.557
me.

23:25.558 --> 23:27.326
<i>Waiting on garnish.</i>

23:27.327 --> 23:29.561
Oh, great.
I'm kinda in my own zone.

23:29.562 --> 23:31.363
Like, if you can't handle
that garnish,

23:31.364 --> 23:32.664
that's your ass, not mine.

23:32.665 --> 23:34.433
Garnish!
Right here, chef.

23:34.434 --> 23:35.801
<i>I know you're not bothered.
We are.</i>

23:35.802 --> 23:36.668
I am bothered, chef.

23:36.669 --> 23:37.869
Oh, .

23:37.870 --> 23:39.571
I'm working my hardest
for you, chef.

23:39.572 --> 23:41.006
<i>How are you doing over there,
garnish?</i>

23:42.375 --> 23:44.076
Despite a lack
of communication

23:44.077 --> 23:45.811
between Danielle and Robin...

23:45.812 --> 23:48.280
Service please.
Very nice, that risotto.

23:48.281 --> 23:51.149
The red team is still
managing to push out appetizers.

23:51.150 --> 23:52.451
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:53.820 --> 23:55.053
And in the blue kitchen...

23:55.054 --> 23:56.655
Walking.

23:56.656 --> 23:58.290
With Brian finally
delivering on the cioppino...

23:58.291 --> 23:59.424
Finally.

23:59.425 --> 24:01.259
Service please.

24:01.260 --> 24:03.395
Appetizers are leaving
the kitchen at a steady pace.

24:03.396 --> 24:05.130
Very tasty.

24:05.131 --> 24:07.799
And now the men are
ready to move on to entrees.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.368
Three cod, two lamb.
How long?

24:09.369 --> 24:10.535
Three minutes, chef.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.037
I better redeem myself.

24:12.038 --> 24:13.505
Let's go!
Let's bring it back together.

24:13.506 --> 24:14.940
Yeah, baby!

24:14.941 --> 24:17.676
Beautiful, golden, sexy
little bastards.

24:17.677 --> 24:19.911
I just wanna let the fish
station know who's boss.

24:19.912 --> 24:20.912
It's me.

24:20.913 --> 24:22.514
Cod walking.

24:22.515 --> 24:24.616
<i>Right behind you.</i>

24:24.617 --> 24:27.052
Beautiful!
Go, boys!

24:29.589 --> 24:30.589
The cod's raw.

24:30.590 --> 24:32.858
<i>Brian!</i>

24:32.859 --> 24:34.793
Hey you, bozo, come here.

24:34.794 --> 24:36.561
<i>Yes, chef.
The cod is raw.</i>

24:36.562 --> 24:39.331
Cat food.
off, will you?

24:39.332 --> 24:40.732
me.

24:40.733 --> 24:44.302
Hey, hello?
Chef, what is that?

24:44.303 --> 24:45.904
Get another one
in the pan, guys.

24:45.905 --> 24:47.139
Three cod, two lamb.
How long?

24:47.140 --> 24:48.440
One minute, chef.

24:48.441 --> 24:50.008
You need help.
I got it, I got it, I got it.

24:50.009 --> 24:52.544
I just can't seem to cook fish.

24:52.545 --> 24:55.147
I just can't seem
to do it tonight.

24:55.148 --> 24:57.783
Three cod, two lamb.
What are we waiting on?

24:57.784 --> 24:59.151
The cod, chef.

24:59.152 --> 25:01.386
Oh, come on.
Check if that's cooked, Justin.

25:01.387 --> 25:02.654
<i>Oui, chef.
What is going on?</i>

25:02.655 --> 25:03.889
<i>What's going on?</i>

25:03.890 --> 25:05.824
That's burnt.

25:05.825 --> 25:06.958
Burnt my damn fish.

25:06.959 --> 25:08.493
Oh, my God.

25:08.494 --> 25:10.262
Relax, take a deep breath.

25:10.263 --> 25:11.730
Come on, come on.

25:11.731 --> 25:13.799
Get another one in.
Do not waste anymore.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.734
Just focus.
Come on, man.

25:15.735 --> 25:18.170
Brian up fish one
after the other after the other.

25:18.171 --> 25:19.638
Overcooking it,
undercooking it...

25:19.639 --> 25:21.039
ends up in the garbage.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.174
We're wasting food.

25:22.175 --> 25:23.275
I know, chef.

25:25.178 --> 25:28.447
Okay, you got Brian here.
You got a pile of here.

25:28.448 --> 25:29.915
And that's where he was.

25:29.916 --> 25:31.683
About that far
under a pile of .

25:31.684 --> 25:33.318
How's that cod going, Brian?

25:33.319 --> 25:34.586
<i>I'm ready.</i>

25:34.587 --> 25:35.987
me.
For real?

25:35.988 --> 25:39.057
Did it again.
Damn it. Agh.

25:39.058 --> 25:41.460
<i>I ran out of cod.</i>

25:41.461 --> 25:43.128
<i>For real?
Is this happening?</i>

25:43.129 --> 25:44.663
Three cod, two lamb.
How long?

25:44.664 --> 25:46.331
I have one cod left, chef.

25:46.332 --> 25:47.966
You've run out of cod?

25:47.967 --> 25:50.235
Yes, chef.
What?

25:50.236 --> 25:52.304
Hey, you... What...

25:52.305 --> 25:54.272
in the are you doing?

25:56.000 --> 26:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here

26:03.439 --> 26:06.241
It's an hour and
15 minutes into dinner service

26:06.242 --> 26:08.477
and neither kitchen
has sent out an entree.

26:08.478 --> 26:10.145
This is ridiculous.

26:10.146 --> 26:11.913
It's serious.
Not okay.

26:11.914 --> 26:14.116
But somehow,
Brian has still managed

26:14.117 --> 26:16.184
to run out of
one of the fish entrees.

26:16.185 --> 26:17.252
You've run out of cod?

26:17.253 --> 26:18.253
Yes, chef.

26:20.923 --> 26:22.057
James!

26:22.058 --> 26:23.525
Yes, chef.
We've run out of cod.

26:23.526 --> 26:24.526
Can we serve the sea bass?

26:24.527 --> 26:26.561
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

26:26.562 --> 26:28.363
Let's go...
three bass, two lamb.

26:28.364 --> 26:29.865
<i>Yes, chef!
Coming right now, baby.</i>

26:30.900 --> 26:32.601
<i>Hey.</i>

26:32.602 --> 26:34.670
It's coming, "baby"?

26:34.671 --> 26:36.872
Sorry, chef.
You cook like a baby.

26:36.873 --> 26:38.240
It won't happen again, chef.

26:38.241 --> 26:39.341
Get out!

26:40.376 --> 26:41.376
Yes, chef.

26:44.447 --> 26:46.548
What's the matter
with that jerk?

26:48.885 --> 26:51.153
Come on, man!

26:51.154 --> 26:53.055
I'll take it from here.

26:53.056 --> 26:55.257
While Justin takes
over on the fish station,

26:55.258 --> 26:57.859
in the red kitchen,
Roshni on the meat station...

26:57.860 --> 26:59.061
Wellington, please.

26:59.062 --> 27:00.729
<i>Right now, chef!</i>

27:00.730 --> 27:02.664
Is ready with
her team's first entrees.

27:02.665 --> 27:03.765
Hot pan, chef.

27:03.766 --> 27:05.233
Hot pan, yeah.

27:05.234 --> 27:07.335
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

27:07.336 --> 27:08.670
Stop.

27:08.671 --> 27:10.472
Raw Wellington.

27:10.473 --> 27:11.506
Look at that.

27:11.507 --> 27:12.541
Two more coming up.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.109
Get it in the oven!

27:14.110 --> 27:15.644
Behind, behind, behind!
Move!

27:15.645 --> 27:16.945
I feel like right now.

27:16.946 --> 27:19.047
I know how to cook meat.
I just gotta focus.

27:19.048 --> 27:20.649
Come on, Roshni.
Wake up, please!

27:20.650 --> 27:22.150
<i>Yes, chef.
I'm awake, chef!</i>

27:22.151 --> 27:23.085
<i>You're awake, are you?
Yes, chef.</i>

27:23.086 --> 27:24.986
Well, do it then!

27:24.987 --> 27:27.456
While Roshni keep
diners on the red side waiting...

27:27.457 --> 27:29.024
<i>How long has it been?
Been a while.</i>

27:29.025 --> 27:30.258
A while.

27:30.259 --> 27:32.327
Justin has jumped on fish.

27:32.328 --> 27:34.262
Where's the bass?

27:34.263 --> 27:36.765
And works to get the
men back to track with entrees.

27:36.766 --> 27:38.600
Service, please.

27:38.601 --> 27:40.602
Now the attention
shifts to Don on the meat station

27:40.603 --> 27:42.170
to keep the momentum going.

27:42.171 --> 27:43.705
We're on the second table
now, guys.

27:43.706 --> 27:45.207
<i>Don't stop working.</i>

27:45.208 --> 27:46.842
<i>Table 10.
Two bass, one Wellington.</i>

27:46.843 --> 27:48.076
Yes, chef.

27:50.646 --> 27:52.080
Wellington goes
in the fancy pan.

27:52.081 --> 27:53.381
<i>Right.
Fancy pan.</i>

27:53.382 --> 27:56.017
Once we got into entrees,

27:56.018 --> 27:58.286
Don is the guy
who's driving the car,

27:58.287 --> 28:00.522
and I'm in the back seat.

28:00.523 --> 28:02.691
You know how many seatbelts
I would put on?

28:02.692 --> 28:04.259
Like... 17.

28:04.260 --> 28:05.527
Come on, Donald!

28:07.463 --> 28:09.564
Okay, I'm ready to go
on the Wellington.

28:09.565 --> 28:12.134
<i>Right behind you!
Wellington coming up!</i>

28:12.135 --> 28:14.536
"Uhh, my Wellingtons
are ready."

28:14.537 --> 28:15.871
I hope they're right.

28:15.872 --> 28:17.139
Obviously, Don.

28:19.909 --> 28:21.610
Pray.

28:21.611 --> 28:23.745
Royce, who cooked
that Wellington?

28:23.746 --> 28:26.148
We did, chef.
Yeah, it's perfect.

28:26.149 --> 28:28.283
What'd I do?
Perfect Wellington.

28:28.284 --> 28:29.484
Oh.

28:31.020 --> 28:32.454
Yes!

28:32.455 --> 28:34.356
Thanks to their
Wellington savant...

28:34.357 --> 28:36.391
<i>Service.</i>

28:36.392 --> 28:38.226
The blue team is getting
entrees out to their diners.

28:38.227 --> 28:39.761
<i>This is really good, yeah.</i>

28:39.762 --> 28:41.163
Meanwhile,
back in the red kitchen...

28:41.164 --> 28:42.330
Where's the Wellington?

28:42.331 --> 28:44.065
Walking, chef.

28:44.066 --> 28:46.401
Roshni is finally
ready with her Wellington.

28:46.402 --> 28:48.703
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

28:48.704 --> 28:49.838
Or is she?

28:49.839 --> 28:50.872
<i>They don't match.</i>

28:50.873 --> 28:52.140
Wellington.

28:52.141 --> 28:53.441
Wellington!

28:53.442 --> 28:55.243
Wellington.
Waiting on the Wellington.

28:55.244 --> 28:56.778
Right now, chef!

28:56.779 --> 28:57.813
Wellington!

28:57.814 --> 28:59.347
Behind.
Behind, behind...

28:59.348 --> 29:01.449
One Wellington.
Behind, behind.

29:01.450 --> 29:02.617
Walk your Wellingtons up.

29:02.618 --> 29:03.752
Yeah.

29:03.753 --> 29:06.121
<i>It's a little raw.
Put it back in.</i>

29:06.122 --> 29:07.155
Hold on.

29:07.156 --> 29:08.924
<i>45 seconds.</i>

29:08.925 --> 29:10.659
Unbelievable.

29:10.660 --> 29:12.494
Roshni is taking the meat
out of the oven,

29:12.495 --> 29:13.628
putting the meat back
in the oven.

29:13.629 --> 29:14.796
Taking the meat
out of the oven,

29:14.797 --> 29:16.498
putting the meat
back in the oven.

29:16.499 --> 29:18.200
Make up your mind what you
wanna do with this damn meat.

29:18.201 --> 29:20.168
Gimme that.
Gimme that, gimme that.

29:20.169 --> 29:22.070
You're only leaving it
in there for two minutes.

29:22.071 --> 29:24.105
What do you think
is gonna happen?

29:24.106 --> 29:25.874
You think the little fairy
people are gonna be in the oven

29:25.875 --> 29:28.243
going,
"Cook. Cook now."

29:28.244 --> 29:29.344
Doesn't work like that.

29:29.345 --> 29:30.779
Where's the Wellington?

29:30.780 --> 29:33.448
Right now, chef.
Pull that, pull that.

29:33.449 --> 29:34.583
Ugh.

29:34.584 --> 29:36.051
<i>That one looks more
like this one.</i>

29:36.052 --> 29:37.219
Wellington!

29:37.220 --> 29:39.087
Yeah, right now.
Walking.

29:39.088 --> 29:42.424
Behind you, chef.
Wellington up.

29:42.425 --> 29:45.060
<i>Oh, me.
It's still stone cold.</i>

29:45.061 --> 29:46.795
All of you, come here.

29:46.796 --> 29:48.496
No, no, no, no.

29:48.497 --> 29:49.931
<i>This far into service, look.</i>

29:49.932 --> 29:51.700
It's raw.

29:51.701 --> 29:53.101
You, get out!

29:53.102 --> 29:54.436
Chef, please,
can I cook one more?

29:54.437 --> 29:55.537
Get out!
Get out!

29:55.538 --> 29:57.939
Piss off!

29:57.940 --> 29:59.641
<i>Can someone put that
back in the oven?</i>

29:59.642 --> 30:02.911
I have a fresh one.
Get out!

30:02.912 --> 30:04.913
Somebody jump on beef.
All right.

30:04.914 --> 30:06.781
While Danielle nervously

30:06.782 --> 30:08.416
steps up to the plate
on the meat station,

30:08.417 --> 30:09.718
over in the blue kitchen...

30:09.719 --> 30:11.620
I want now two New York strip.

30:11.621 --> 30:14.155
Don is ready
to hit another homerun.

30:14.156 --> 30:16.625
Okay, I'll be right there.
Cutting it right now.

30:16.626 --> 30:17.893
<i>Raw!</i>

30:17.894 --> 30:19.160
Wait, he needs more time.

30:19.161 --> 30:20.695
<i>He just cut a raw sirloin.</i>

30:20.696 --> 30:22.364
<i>So it's fine.
I'm ready, that's fine.</i>

30:22.365 --> 30:23.999
Sirloin needs to cook.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.634
It's raw.

30:25.635 --> 30:27.202
<i>Royce, shut up.
I am ready to go.</i>

30:27.203 --> 30:28.703
Two New Yorks.

30:28.704 --> 30:30.105
<i>I think it's a little raw.</i>

30:30.106 --> 30:31.973
Listening to him talk,
it's just,

30:31.974 --> 30:33.708
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

30:33.709 --> 30:35.877
They okay?
Not really.

30:35.878 --> 30:38.747
Donald!
Oh, .

30:40.616 --> 30:42.684
Not-not-not pink,
like it should be.

30:42.685 --> 30:44.152
Raw!
Sorry, chef.

30:44.153 --> 30:46.621
Can I have two medium rare
New York strip?

30:46.622 --> 30:47.789
Yes, chef.

30:47.790 --> 30:48.924
Come on, dumbo.

30:48.925 --> 30:50.492
Okay, one minute.

30:50.493 --> 30:53.828
It gets very frazzling
in that situation in there.

30:53.829 --> 30:55.230
You're just...
how would I put it?

30:55.231 --> 30:56.398
yourself.

30:56.399 --> 30:57.899
I got it.
One minute.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.367
Don, be honest with your times.

30:59.368 --> 31:00.735
Come on, Donald!
Let's go!

31:00.736 --> 31:01.803
<i>One minute, chef.
One minute.</i>

31:01.804 --> 31:03.038
<i>One minute, chef.</i>

31:03.039 --> 31:05.173
"One minute,
I'm going up ."

31:05.174 --> 31:07.208
One minute on that.
You gotta be kidding me.

31:07.209 --> 31:09.277
One minute!
One minute on that steak, chef.

31:09.278 --> 31:11.179
Donald!
One minute, one minute, chef.

31:11.180 --> 31:12.681
Three minutes ago,
you said one minute.

31:12.682 --> 31:13.815
<i>Yeah, I'll be right there.
One minute.</i>

31:13.816 --> 31:15.517
What is going on?

31:15.518 --> 31:17.218
<i>You're shouting "one minute"
just like a idiot.</i>

31:17.219 --> 31:18.687
<i>Okay, uh...</i>

31:18.688 --> 31:19.754
Like a minute and a half.

31:19.755 --> 31:20.789
Oh, my God.

31:20.790 --> 31:22.457
hell.

31:22.458 --> 31:24.793
<i>Come on, Donald!</i>

31:24.794 --> 31:27.896
<i>Yes, chef.
Coming up.</i>

31:29.098 --> 31:31.800
Sorry, chef.

31:31.801 --> 31:33.034
What the ?

31:33.035 --> 31:34.502
Oh, my God.

31:34.503 --> 31:36.404
<i>Yeah, stop. Stop!</i>

31:36.405 --> 31:37.706
Ohh.

31:37.707 --> 31:39.574
You keep me waiting,

31:39.575 --> 31:41.543
then they arrive in the window
medium well.

31:41.544 --> 31:43.611
<i>And you're telling me
one minute,</i>

31:43.612 --> 31:46.014
I come back four minutes later
and it's still one minute.

31:47.116 --> 31:49.250
Get out!

31:49.251 --> 31:50.385
off.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.087
That sucked.

31:52.088 --> 31:53.755
But you know what, chef?

31:53.756 --> 31:55.790
There's a lot of
going on in the kitchen.

31:55.791 --> 31:58.059
And he's sitting there
chastising my ass.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.661
I mean, I am trying my best.

31:59.662 --> 32:02.731
But no, that wasn't
good enough for him.

32:02.732 --> 32:04.866
Sorry.

32:04.867 --> 32:07.035
<i>Royce, get that meat done.</i>

32:07.036 --> 32:09.604
As the musical stations
continue in Hell's Kitchen,

32:09.605 --> 32:11.139
Royce takes over on meat.

32:11.140 --> 32:12.707
And on the red team,

32:12.708 --> 32:14.242
Danielle is taking a turn
at the Wellingtons.

32:14.243 --> 32:15.643
All right,
I'm walking Wellington!

32:15.644 --> 32:16.745
Garnish.

32:16.746 --> 32:17.946
Garnish to the pass.

32:17.947 --> 32:19.180
Sauce!

32:19.181 --> 32:20.582
I have the sauces.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.183
And the women have finally

32:22.184 --> 32:23.018
brought their first entrees
to the pass.

32:23.019 --> 32:24.452
Great teamwork, guys.

32:26.689 --> 32:28.223
What is that?

32:28.224 --> 32:29.591
<i>It's not even hot.</i>

32:29.592 --> 32:31.092
<i>All of you, come here.</i>

32:31.093 --> 32:32.394
Just taste that for me.

32:32.395 --> 32:34.129
All of you, taste that.

32:34.130 --> 32:36.564
Taste the garlic
on that.

32:36.565 --> 32:37.832
Who seasoned that?

32:37.833 --> 32:39.300
Sorry, chef.

32:39.301 --> 32:40.735
Hey, madame, madame.

32:40.736 --> 32:41.836
Your mouth just explodes
full of garlic.

32:41.837 --> 32:42.771
I understand that chef.

32:42.772 --> 32:44.873
<i>After that, stone cold sauce.</i>

32:44.874 --> 32:46.007
<i>Who sent me that sauce?</i>

32:46.008 --> 32:47.208
<i>Um...</i>

32:47.209 --> 32:48.410
I did.

32:48.411 --> 32:50.011
<i>Stop! Both of you!</i>

32:50.012 --> 32:51.012
off.
Get out of my sight.

32:51.013 --> 32:53.581
Get out of my sight.
Get out!

32:56.519 --> 32:59.354
While the women
look for somebody... anybody...

32:59.355 --> 33:01.289
to take over
on the meat station,

33:01.290 --> 33:02.791
over in the blue kitchen...

33:02.792 --> 33:04.192
I need two bass urgently!

33:04.193 --> 33:05.360
You got it.

33:05.361 --> 33:06.795
Yes, I got 'em.
I got 'em.

33:06.796 --> 33:08.630
For some reason,

33:08.631 --> 33:10.765
both Royce and Justin
are cooking fish.

33:10.766 --> 33:11.833
<i>Two bass.</i>

33:11.834 --> 33:12.901
Let's go!

33:12.902 --> 33:14.169
<i>Oui, chef.
One minute.</i>

33:14.170 --> 33:15.537
One minute.
Ugh!

33:15.538 --> 33:17.806
Hey, who's cooking the bass?
Right here, chef.

33:17.807 --> 33:19.374
I am, chef.
I got two bass.

33:19.375 --> 33:20.942
I have it in my hand
for this order.

33:20.943 --> 33:22.143
I got two more.

33:22.144 --> 33:24.312
Oh, my God!

33:24.313 --> 33:25.480
<i>Hey, Royce...</i>

33:25.481 --> 33:26.614
Are you stupid?

33:26.615 --> 33:28.183
No.

33:28.184 --> 33:29.417
<i>You've got bass there,</i>

33:29.418 --> 33:30.785
he's got bass there.

33:30.786 --> 33:32.620
<i>It's the same table, you idiot.</i>

33:32.621 --> 33:34.456
<i>And not one of you
are communicating!</i>

33:34.457 --> 33:35.957
Both of you, off
out of here.

33:35.958 --> 33:37.926
hell.

33:37.927 --> 33:39.160
off!

33:44.854 --> 33:47.355
It's two hours
into dinner service,

33:47.356 --> 33:49.758
and very few entrees
have made it to the dining room.

33:51.661 --> 33:53.028
But more than half the chefs...

33:53.029 --> 33:54.496
Get out!

33:54.497 --> 33:56.097
Have been
kicked out of the kitchen.

33:56.098 --> 33:57.465
<i>Piss off!
Get out!</i>

33:57.466 --> 33:58.500
Get out!

33:58.501 --> 33:59.868
<i>Get out!
Both of you!</i>

33:59.869 --> 34:01.136
off out of here!

34:02.705 --> 34:04.306
Justin and Royce
are the latest casualties.

34:05.741 --> 34:07.542
Chef gets pissed off
because people make mistakes,

34:07.543 --> 34:08.743
mistakes, mistakes, mistakes.

34:08.744 --> 34:09.878
And then the last guy
who comes on there

34:09.879 --> 34:10.612
makes a mistake gets .

34:10.612 --> 34:13.114
Ridiculous!

34:13.114 --> 34:14.482
Y'all good over there?

34:14.483 --> 34:15.784
Wellington!

34:15.784 --> 34:17.418
<i>Yes, chef!
Yes, chef!</i>

34:17.420 --> 34:19.521
There's only five of us
left in the kitchen,

34:19.522 --> 34:21.322
but we need to get this
out tonight.

34:21.324 --> 34:23.725
We need to finish
dinner service.

34:23.726 --> 34:24.893
Here, chef.

34:24.893 --> 34:27.161
Service, please.
Go, come back.

34:27.163 --> 34:28.929
And the Wellingtons.

34:28.931 --> 34:30.632
After that is one bass, one
New York strip, one Wellington.

34:30.632 --> 34:31.666
Yes, chef!
Come on, guys.

34:31.667 --> 34:32.833
Pushing it out.

34:32.835 --> 34:33.902
<i>Coming right now.</i>

34:33.902 --> 34:35.203
Behind you is the sauce.

34:35.204 --> 34:36.771
<i>Service, please.</i>

34:36.772 --> 34:38.473
Unbelievably, fewer chefs

34:38.474 --> 34:40.809
has resulted in more food
leaving the kitchen.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.476
<i>The Wellingtons.</i>

34:42.478 --> 34:43.812
Mmm.

34:43.813 --> 34:45.347
Bass to the pass, chef.

34:45.348 --> 34:46.815
<i>Service, please.</i>

34:46.815 --> 34:48.315
<i>Keep it going.
Just focus.</i>

34:48.317 --> 34:49.885
<i>Okay, I got it, I got it.</i>

34:49.886 --> 34:51.386
<i>I got one left,
come on, ladies.</i>

34:51.387 --> 34:52.353
<i>Coming up!
Finally.</i>

34:52.355 --> 34:53.487
<i>Service, please.</i>

34:53.489 --> 34:54.723
Good job!

34:54.724 --> 34:56.257
Stoves off, Patrick.

35:00.429 --> 35:02.097
Line up, guys.
Hurry up.

35:02.098 --> 35:03.465
<i>Trust me, it won't take long.</i>

35:03.466 --> 35:05.100
Tonight,

35:05.101 --> 35:08.536
it was painful
just watching you disintegrate.

35:08.537 --> 35:11.006
It was like having a root canal
and passing a kidney stone

35:11.007 --> 35:14.910
at the same time.

35:14.911 --> 35:17.479
The losing team...

35:17.480 --> 35:19.347
<i>has to be...</i>

35:19.348 --> 35:20.882
both teams.

35:22.852 --> 35:24.786
All of you,
go back to the dorms

35:24.787 --> 35:27.188
<i>and come up with two
individuals from each team</i>

35:27.189 --> 35:28.757
<i>that you wanna send home.</i>

35:28.758 --> 35:32.560
Now off out of here,
will you?

35:32.561 --> 35:35.330
We had a terrible service.

35:35.331 --> 35:37.065
These guys got their heads
in their .

35:37.066 --> 35:38.767
I'm not afraid to say

35:38.768 --> 35:40.669
"get the hell out of the
blue team so we can progress."

35:40.670 --> 35:42.003
'Cause it's dead weight.

35:42.004 --> 35:43.505
Clemenza, do you wanna start?

35:43.506 --> 35:45.707
Don, I just think
you were lost.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.676
<i>You couldn't handle it.</i>

35:47.677 --> 35:49.544
<i>The only thing that I
up was one New York.</i>

35:49.545 --> 35:50.979
<i>That's it.</i>

35:50.980 --> 35:52.914
I'm pissed!

35:52.915 --> 35:54.149
It wasn't me
that brought us down,

35:54.150 --> 35:57.018
it was fish!

35:57.019 --> 35:58.586
Brian, you're a personal chef,

35:58.587 --> 36:00.455
but you can't cook a piece
of fish.

36:00.456 --> 36:02.257
It's not blowing one order.
Blowing ten orders...

36:02.258 --> 36:03.792
<i>You don't know how to cook
a piece of fish.</i>

36:03.793 --> 36:05.460
Brian couldn't get his head
out of his .

36:05.461 --> 36:07.095
I know about five monkeys

36:07.096 --> 36:08.396
that could've done a better
service tonight.

36:08.397 --> 36:09.965
I let everyone down.

36:09.966 --> 36:13.902
And that is something
I will never do again.

36:13.903 --> 36:15.704
My two nominees
are Don and Brian.

36:15.705 --> 36:17.772
<i>The two of you guys
had a rough night.</i>

36:17.773 --> 36:19.341
It put a strain
on everybody else.

36:19.342 --> 36:20.642
I gotta go with the same two.

36:20.643 --> 36:22.344
I'm... same.

36:22.345 --> 36:24.512
<i>Good.</i>

36:24.513 --> 36:26.147
I am not one of the weakest
chefs here.

36:26.148 --> 36:27.549
Not even close.

36:27.550 --> 36:30.352
So I'm gonna fight,
and I'm not going home.

36:34.123 --> 36:36.024
It's not a hard decision, guys.

36:36.025 --> 36:37.325
It's whoever got kicked
out of the kitchen tonight,

36:37.326 --> 36:38.560
I feel like.

36:38.561 --> 36:40.228
<i>You all agree?
Yeah, I'm down.</i>

36:40.229 --> 36:42.630
<i>I'm with Rosh.</i>

36:42.631 --> 36:46.167
<i>Mine is for Rosh as well.</i>

36:46.168 --> 36:48.737
I screwed up my Wellington.
That was it.

36:48.738 --> 36:50.638
I can't be up
for elimination again.

36:50.639 --> 36:53.041
It's now three times in a row.

36:53.042 --> 36:56.945
I'm gonna say Robyn, just based
on stations that broke down.

36:56.946 --> 36:58.480
<i>Robyn, you were sinking.</i>

36:58.481 --> 37:00.081
That's all I have to say.

37:00.082 --> 37:02.117
Yeah, but, Dani,
at one point, girl,

37:02.118 --> 37:04.686
<i>you stopped communicating...
it just ended at one point.</i>

37:04.687 --> 37:06.554
Dani, you me tonight.

37:06.555 --> 37:08.323
Now you're saying that
I'm the one who was thinking?

37:08.324 --> 37:11.092
You can go yourself.

37:11.093 --> 37:13.628
I'm gonna vote for Dani,
just because, like,

37:13.629 --> 37:15.230
she got quiet, y'all.

37:15.231 --> 37:16.598
I just feel like I haven't
up anything

37:16.599 --> 37:19.234
since I been here.

37:19.235 --> 37:22.771
Kimmie, you're just a
idiot, in my opinion.

37:22.772 --> 37:24.873
<i>It's so much gray area.
It sucks.</i>

37:24.874 --> 37:26.074
<i>I'm having a hard time
with this one too.</i>

37:26.075 --> 37:27.342
It's not a hard decision.

37:27.343 --> 37:29.077
Three of us were kicked out.

37:29.078 --> 37:31.646
<i>Choose two.
Let's all be women about it.</i>

37:46.362 --> 37:48.229
Royce.
First nominee...

37:48.230 --> 37:49.397
And why.

37:49.398 --> 37:50.732
Don.

37:50.733 --> 37:52.700
<i>I mean, he was just
a deer in headlights</i>

37:52.701 --> 37:54.302
<i>a couple days in a row.</i>

37:54.303 --> 37:55.303
Second nominee.

37:55.304 --> 37:56.905
Brian, chef.

37:56.906 --> 37:59.240
<i>He, uh, burnt
a lot fish tonight...</i>

37:59.241 --> 38:01.476
And really went down sailing.

38:01.477 --> 38:03.344
Christina.

38:03.345 --> 38:04.512
Red team's first nominee
and why.

38:04.513 --> 38:06.314
Roshni...

38:06.315 --> 38:08.917
The meat just held us up.

38:08.918 --> 38:10.118
Second nominee and why.

38:10.119 --> 38:13.054
Um...

38:13.055 --> 38:16.291
Um...

38:16.292 --> 38:18.093
Um, pfft...

38:26.038 --> 38:29.140
After a dinner
service full of major issues,

38:29.141 --> 38:32.877
chef Ramsay has asked for
two nominees from each team.

38:32.878 --> 38:36.414
The men have nominated
Brian and Don.

38:36.415 --> 38:39.450
The women have put up
Roshni as their first nominee,

38:39.451 --> 38:41.552
but are having trouble...
Um...

38:41.553 --> 38:43.521
Naming a second.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.323
Um...

38:45.324 --> 38:46.490
Excuse me?

38:46.491 --> 38:48.826
Uh, Danielle.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.495
Danielle, Roshni.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.230
Don, Brian.

38:53.231 --> 38:55.132
Step forward, please.
Let's go.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.004
Roshni,

39:00.005 --> 39:01.439
we've only had four services.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.506
You've been here three times.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.674
Yes, chef.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.443
Are you honestly
over your head?

39:05.444 --> 39:07.044
I can't go home yet.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.512
I'm a fighter.

39:08.513 --> 39:12.617
I'm a team player,
and I've got the passion, chef.

39:12.618 --> 39:13.851
Danielle.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.319
Yes, chef.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.488
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:17.489 --> 39:19.357
I haven't had any other problems
besides communication.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.891
That's quite an important part.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.226
Yes, chef.

39:23.495 --> 39:26.197
Don, why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:26.198 --> 39:29.200
Well, I think I have a lot
to offer the team.

39:31.003 --> 39:34.038
Why does your team
not believe in you?

39:34.039 --> 39:35.840
They want me to step up.

39:35.841 --> 39:39.210
They don't want you to step up.
They want you to step out.

39:39.211 --> 39:42.313
They want you gone...
Don.

39:42.314 --> 39:43.681
<i>Brian...</i>

39:43.682 --> 39:45.116
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:45.117 --> 39:46.751
Chef, I'm a machine.

39:46.752 --> 39:47.852
You're a what?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.153
<i>I'm a machine.
A machine?</i>

39:49.154 --> 39:50.254
Yes.

39:50.255 --> 39:53.324
I'm not looking
for a machine.

39:53.325 --> 39:55.760
Machines build cars.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.496
Chefs are individuals.

39:59.631 --> 40:00.965
Okay.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.333
There's someone here

40:02.334 --> 40:06.570
whose head is just
not in the game.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.905
My decision is...

40:13.512 --> 40:14.912
Don.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.614
<i>Gimme your jacket, big boy.</i>

40:16.615 --> 40:19.316
Time to leave Hell's Kitchen.

40:19.317 --> 40:20.851
I just don't get it.
All right.

40:20.852 --> 40:21.952
Thank you.
Thank you, chef.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.488
Good night.

40:24.489 --> 40:28.125
<i>I do not get it.</i>

40:28.126 --> 40:30.327
I thought that I would
be able to come out here

40:30.328 --> 40:31.962
and, you know,
that he would just love my food.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.932
And you know,
I thought I was more of a...

40:34.933 --> 40:37.435
Perfectionit...
perfectionist...

40:37.436 --> 40:38.869
Um, than I was.

40:40.472 --> 40:43.274
Based on tonight's performance,

40:43.275 --> 40:44.975
I'm not done yet.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.279
I'm not going on like this.

40:49.581 --> 40:53.117
Danielle...
Back in line.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.418
Yes!

40:55.987 --> 40:57.555
Brian, back in line.

40:57.556 --> 40:58.556
Yes, chef.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.560
Roshni, gimme your jacket.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.565
<i>Let me tell you something
really important.</i>

41:07.566 --> 41:11.168
You're in the blue team.
Get in there.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.269
Hang tough, Rosh.

41:12.270 --> 41:13.170
Thank you, chef.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.772
Roshni.
Chef.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.874
Maybe a change in environment

41:16.875 --> 41:18.409
may make a change
in your performance.

41:18.410 --> 41:19.944
Yes, chef.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.145
Now off.

41:23.882 --> 41:26.650
Holy , was that scary.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.652
Thank God he gave me a chance.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.454
Whew.

41:30.455 --> 41:32.490
As long as I'm
wearing a chef's jacket...

41:32.491 --> 41:34.759
it doesn't matter
what color it is...

41:34.760 --> 41:36.193
I've been a fighter
all my life,

41:36.194 --> 41:37.428
and I'm not stopping here.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.263
This is a kick in the ass.

41:39.264 --> 41:42.867
I'm ready... to fight.
Like, it's go time.

41:44.436 --> 41:46.871
Everyone in Hell's Kitchen
starts at the bottom.

41:46.872 --> 41:48.873
Unfortunately,
Don stayed there.
