00:23.790 --> 00:26.191
HOMER (laughs):
Whoo! Pork chops with gravy!

00:26.193 --> 00:29.795
Wait. But today's
not Pork Chop Tuesday.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.864
Or Gravy Thursday!

00:31.866 --> 00:33.365
I also set up
some mirrors

00:33.367 --> 00:35.968
so you could watch
hockey fights while you eat.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.037
Whoo-hoo!

00:39.339 --> 00:43.342
Oh, I love
Canadian-on-Canadian violence.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.144
Oh, baby, this
is so great!

00:45.146 --> 00:46.311
Thank you so much.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.048
I'm just happy <i>you're</i> happy.

00:50.316 --> 00:53.185
Wait a minute, that's not
something people really feel.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.054
What's going on?

00:55.056 --> 00:57.156
Well, I do have a favor.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.491
Patty and Selma came home
early from their vacation,

00:59.493 --> 01:02.194
but the cleaners
still haven't gotten
all the black mold

01:02.196 --> 01:03.962
out of their apartment.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.031
(deep roar)

01:06.033 --> 01:07.900
So they need a place to stay.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.068
Here.

01:10.036 --> 01:12.004
(shrieks)
Paris was a bust.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.073
They wouldn't even let
us see the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

01:14.075 --> 01:16.341
They kept yelling,
<i>"La Joconde!</i>

01:16.343 --> 01:18.377
Her smile will die!"

01:18.379 --> 01:19.845
No, Marge, no!

01:19.847 --> 01:21.680
You can't invite
a couple of Riddlers

01:21.682 --> 01:23.348
to stay in the Bat Cave!

01:23.350 --> 01:26.018
You ate the food
<i>and</i> looked in the mirrors.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.553
They're staying!

01:27.555 --> 01:30.589
(gruff chuckling)

01:30.591 --> 01:32.691
(inhaling, exhaling loudly)

01:32.693 --> 01:35.227
(Bart and Lisa coughing)

01:35.229 --> 01:36.228
Hmm.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.529
Oh, honey,

01:37.531 --> 01:39.865
one teensy problem
with this plan.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.400
I'm a teensy bit concerned

01:41.402 --> 01:43.702
about them smoking
around the children.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.538
You know, their lungs
are so <i>teensy.</i>

01:46.540 --> 01:48.073
Mwah! Mwah!

01:48.075 --> 01:50.109
Hmm. He has a point.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.377
No, no. No, no, we
don't have to smoke.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.047
We can stop whenever
we want. See?

01:55.049 --> 01:56.381
(hissing)

01:56.383 --> 01:58.383
(both grunt)

01:58.385 --> 01:59.918
Okay, how about this--

01:59.920 --> 02:02.054
if you catch us
smoking in the house,

02:02.056 --> 02:05.257
even one time, you can
throw us out on the street.

02:05.259 --> 02:08.760
You know what?
I trust them not to smoke.

02:08.762 --> 02:12.197
And if you trust them,
I trust them, too.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.734
(devious chuckling)

02:15.736 --> 02:17.069
Safety first!

02:17.071 --> 02:19.571
Screw this.
We'll just go outside.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.007
Nature is
God's ashtray.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.476
(grunting)

02:24.478 --> 02:26.345
(thunder crashes)

02:27.313 --> 02:28.747
Bad news, bears.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.583
Forecast calls for
nothing but rain.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.418
(both groaning)

02:33.420 --> 02:35.587

02:37.424 --> 02:39.491

02:44.164 --> 02:46.598
Here we go.
Problem solved.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.534
Electric cigarettes.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.170
(loud inhaling)

02:52.605 --> 02:55.340
Choke on our harmless fumes.

02:56.943 --> 02:57.976
Hmm?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.444
Well, if you
fall asleep with them,

02:59.446 --> 03:01.280
will you even burn to death?

03:01.282 --> 03:03.315
BOTH:
Uh-uh.
Oh.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.918
(loud, rapid
inhaling and exhaling)

03:06.953 --> 03:08.620
They call these cigarettes?

03:08.622 --> 03:11.123
They don't stain my fingers,
my hair smells like hair,

03:11.125 --> 03:13.659
and what do I stub out
in my scrambled eggs?

03:13.661 --> 03:16.528
Sure, it's got the nicotine,
but where's the tar?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.363
Where's the stab
from every breath

03:18.365 --> 03:20.365
that reminds me I'm alive?

03:22.368 --> 03:24.970
No smoke detector!
Let's roll!

03:24.972 --> 03:27.706
(both grunting)

03:33.313 --> 03:35.480
Wait, wait.

03:35.482 --> 03:38.550
Turn on the faucet so
no one'll get suspicious.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.555
(explosion)

03:43.557 --> 03:46.158
(smoke detectors beeping)

03:46.160 --> 03:48.360
Aha! I gotcha!

03:48.362 --> 03:50.662
(beeping stops)
You can't resist
smoking in the house

03:50.664 --> 03:53.165
any more than I can resist
drinking in the car.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.733
What happened?
I don't know.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.735
The water caught on fire.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.403
(gasps)

03:58.405 --> 04:00.906
And now I banish you
from paradise.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.908
I'm glad I never
bothered to learn

04:02.910 --> 04:04.910
which one of you is which.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.512
Please, show some compassion
for two good people

04:07.514 --> 04:10.349
who just can't stop smoking.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.850
Hmm... hmm.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.586
I know just the place.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.854

04:15.856 --> 04:17.522

04:28.569 --> 04:30.569
Who needs Paris?

05:25.926 --> 05:28.427

He made us watch him dance

06:03.197 --> 06:04.963

only has one move.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.506
Hmm, this is clearly
a fracking site.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.808
How are they

Aw, it's a terrific sport...

06:20.848 --> 06:22.381
Shh!

06:24.817 --> 06:27.819
This whole building
is just a facade

06:27.821 --> 06:30.222

06:31.157 --> 06:32.991
Indeed it is.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.328
Evergreen Terrace is built
atop a massive shale deposit.

06:36.330 --> 06:39.331
Think of it--
all that poor natural gas

10:15.749 --> 10:17.782
To win people over,
I'll need a salesman

10:17.784 --> 10:21.286
whose folksy facade masks
a deep gusher of greed.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.290
Hmm?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.828
(chuckles)

10:31.263 --> 10:33.898
Congratulations, Simpson!
You're now my chief

10:33.900 --> 10:36.568
energy innovation
marketing officer.
Whoo-hoo!

10:36.570 --> 10:38.603
All you've got to do
is sell fracking

10:38.605 --> 10:40.271
to your friends and neighbors.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.773
Whoo-hoo?
I don't know,

10:41.775 --> 10:44.275
"fracking" is one
of those scary Lisa words.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.745
Bah! Fracking produces
enough clean natural gas

10:46.747 --> 10:49.814
to make America independent
of sheiks, caliphs and...

10:49.816 --> 10:51.249
Scandinavians.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.917
Not to mention,
it doesn't create

10:52.919 --> 10:55.754
any of that awful
worker-mutating nuclear waste.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.756
Homer, game starts
in an hour.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.758
Don't forget to set
your fantasy lineup.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.959
Thanks, Charlie.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.294
Maybe fracking isn't so bad.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.764
Then say yes to this raise,
this promotion

11:05.766 --> 11:07.632
and this flannel shirt,
which says:

11:07.634 --> 11:09.801
"I'm not screwing you over."

11:09.803 --> 11:11.670
I'm not screwing you over.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.673
No, uh, <i>I'm</i> not
screwing you over.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.975
I'm not screwing <i>you</i> over.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.577
(crying):
I'm so proud of you, Papa.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.114
Some folks will tell you
that fracking's no good,

11:23.116 --> 11:25.116
but what they don't tell you is,

11:25.118 --> 11:27.786
hydraulic fracturing
creates jobs.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.688
And all those new workers
are gonna want

11:29.690 --> 11:33.358
to spend their earnings buying
what you're selling-- beer.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.026
Authentic Italian food.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.028
Useless left-handed crap.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.797
Magical nonsense.

11:38.799 --> 11:42.133
Expensive toys for grown-ups
they don't open or play with.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.868
Pornography and nachos.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.671
High-quality
Spanish-language programming.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.973
High-quality
methamphetamines.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.343
Laundry, homework, pranks,
poop, poop and poop.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.846
But our water was on fire.

11:54.848 --> 11:58.216
How could you sell fracking
for Mr. Burns?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.218
'Cause I've never gotten
a promotion before.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.353
Once I thought I had,
but it turned out

12:02.355 --> 12:04.556
to be a beautifully-worded
firing,

12:04.558 --> 12:07.392
so judge me all you want.
I <i>am</i> judging you.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.394
Good. Judge away.
Judge, judge,
judge, judge, judge.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.196
Don't care. Don't care.
Judge, judge, judge,
judge, judge, judge.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.731
Don't care. Don't care.
Judge, judge, judge.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.165
Judge, judge.
Don't care.
Don't care.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.900
Pumping frack cash.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.403
It's a gas cash... blast?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.872
<i>Residents of Evergreen Terrace</i>
<i>are undecided</i>

12:20.874 --> 12:24.008
<i>whether to sell their</i>
<i>mineral rights to Mr. Burns.</i>

12:24.010 --> 12:28.713
Mr. Burns is a vampire sucking
the lifeblood of this town

12:28.715 --> 12:31.583
and lining his coffin with cash.

12:31.585 --> 12:35.520
Oh, Maxine, no one insults me
in a sound bite the way you do.

12:35.522 --> 12:39.557
Oh, Monty, you're such
a sexy little Nosferatu.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.025
Same time tomorrow night?

12:41.027 --> 12:42.427
(chuckles)

12:42.429 --> 12:43.695
I'll bring the oxygen.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.029
(quietly):
Better bring two tanks.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.030
Hmm?

12:46.032 --> 12:47.365
FRINK:
<i>And so,</i>

12:47.367 --> 12:49.367
we see a clear
correlation

12:49.369 --> 12:51.736
between industrial
hydro compounds

12:51.738 --> 12:53.538
and water table
contamination

12:53.540 --> 12:55.273
well outside the...

12:55.275 --> 12:57.942
margin of error.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.746
Mr. Simpson, rebuttal?

13:01.748 --> 13:03.214
(clears throat)

13:03.216 --> 13:04.949
Everyone who signs over
their mineral rights

13:04.951 --> 13:07.886
to Mr. Burns gets $5,000.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.587
5,000 smackers?!

13:09.589 --> 13:11.956
Money is like
a job you don't
even have to do!

13:11.958 --> 13:15.960
(dance music playing)

13:15.962 --> 13:17.395
<i>Ay, dinero.</i>

13:17.397 --> 13:18.396
Signing Stu.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.798
(laughter)

13:23.068 --> 13:26.104
I think my arguments were
more cogent-- bo-hyvik.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.605
What?!

13:27.607 --> 13:30.008
Cogent-- bo-hyvik!

13:31.243 --> 13:33.578
Mr. Burns, we did it!

13:33.580 --> 13:37.081
Everyone in the neighborhood
sold us their gas rights!

13:37.083 --> 13:39.317
Hmm.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.586
Excellent.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.822
No, no. It's excellent.
It's excellent.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.657
Uh, maybe you can
help me, Simpson.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.826
You've had a relationship
or two in your life.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.461
(laughing):
Well... one.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.331
I have embarked on a
"beneficial friendship"

13:53.333 --> 13:55.967
with a woman with whom I
have nothing in common.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.803
Her opinions are abhorrent
to me, but the passion.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.940
Well, look at these racy texts
she sends me.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.409
(rhythmic clicking)

14:05.978 --> 14:08.279
Oh, baby.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.348
How long can I sustain
this high-wire act

14:10.350 --> 14:13.117
of loathing and lust?

14:13.119 --> 14:15.854
Well, I'm no Carl
when it comes to this stuff,

14:15.856 --> 14:17.622
but I ain't no Lenny, neither.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.290
And I would say...

14:19.292 --> 14:22.360
no matter how much you try
to keep things casual,

14:22.362 --> 14:24.796
someone always gets hurt.

14:24.798 --> 14:29.601
Hmm. Well, then I must harden my
heart against such an outcome.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.638
I appreciate the counsel,
Simpson.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.641
Now, please trap-door
yourself out.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.476
Glad I could be of help!

14:38.478 --> 14:39.777
(indistinct chatter)

14:41.347 --> 14:44.415
Do you have the
signed gas leases?

14:46.719 --> 14:47.819
BURNS:
Hold on.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.487
This feels light.

14:49.489 --> 14:53.024
Ah. One of these deeds
is missing a signature.

14:53.026 --> 14:56.194
The gas rights transfer form
for 742 Evergreen Terrace

14:56.196 --> 14:59.831
was never signed by...
Marge Simpson.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.567
(gasps)
Marge, why
didn't you sign?

15:02.569 --> 15:05.370
Our water was on fire!

15:05.372 --> 15:07.505
I'm sorry, but
the law states

15:07.507 --> 15:10.742
that unless every single
resident sells their rights,

15:10.744 --> 15:13.378
Burns can't
frack drop one!

15:13.380 --> 15:15.513
ALL:
Oh!

15:15.515 --> 15:16.915
Oh, I was counting on that money

15:16.917 --> 15:18.349
to pay for my other
calf implant.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.517
Yuck.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.920
I already felt the pride
of energy independence.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.188
(loud, overlapping
crowd chatter)

15:24.190 --> 15:27.091
Marge Simpson,
I'm as mad at you

15:27.093 --> 15:29.227
as you usually
are at me!

15:29.229 --> 15:31.562
(gasps)
Hmm!

15:31.564 --> 15:34.098
(indistinct chatter)

15:34.100 --> 15:36.534
(wind whistling)

15:36.536 --> 15:38.269
Cheer up, Monty.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.071
All you lost was money,

15:40.073 --> 15:42.607
but what you get is... me.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.612
(cracking)

15:47.614 --> 15:49.380
All I lost was <i>money?</i>

15:49.382 --> 15:50.915
(laughs)

15:50.917 --> 15:53.051
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.053
Our dalliance meant
nothing to me!

15:55.055 --> 15:58.056
You were but a sprig of parsley
garnishing my beefsteak.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.459
Now I cast you aside
for the busboys to gnaw upon.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.295
Considered this ill-conceived
affair terminated!

16:04.297 --> 16:06.965
(gasps)

16:06.967 --> 16:08.967
(chuckling)

16:08.969 --> 16:11.135
I played this just perfectly.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.576
Oh, yeah, great.
Great, Marge, great work.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.980
Thanks to you, Springfield will
never be a natural gas boomtown,

16:21.982 --> 16:25.984
and like all boomtowns,
it would have lasted forever.

16:25.986 --> 16:29.587
Oh! Our water was on fire!

16:29.589 --> 16:33.124
Oh!    <i>W</i>on fire. <i>Was!</i>

16:33.126 --> 16:35.259
I finally got a job
I was good at,

16:35.261 --> 16:38.629
and now I have to give it up!

16:38.631 --> 16:41.599
So, you've come begging
not to be fired?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.768
Smithers, turn my back
on this man!

16:43.770 --> 16:46.270
Maximum huff!

16:46.272 --> 16:48.606
Wait, Mr. Burns.
I'm here to man up.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.274
It was all
my wife's fault!

16:50.276 --> 16:51.776
(sighs heavily)

16:51.778 --> 16:54.278
Sometimes I think she and I
have nothing in common!

16:54.280 --> 16:57.115
Nothing in common,
eh? Tell me more.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.649
Marge likes sushi.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.785
I like gum that
squirts in your mouth.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.453
She's into romantic comedies.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.955
I like movies where there's only

17:03.957 --> 17:06.190
one day a year
when murder is legal.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.527
Yup, Marge and I see the world
in totally different ways.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.329
Hmm. Different, exactly.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.465
That's why I had to give
my woman the old heave-ho.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.834
So, you don't miss
that politics lady at all?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.469
Not for one
Chinese second.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.872
And I'm sure
she's forgotten all about me.

17:22.141 --> 17:23.975
(both gasp)

17:23.977 --> 17:25.510
Killdozers.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.145
Whatever are you doing, man?!

17:27.147 --> 17:29.313
We're tearing down this place
and putting up

17:29.315 --> 17:31.049
a recycling center,

17:31.051 --> 17:33.317
slash Native American
history museum,

17:33.319 --> 17:34.986
slash condor
sanctuary.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.654
(screeching)

17:36.656 --> 17:39.724
Hmm. A project this bloated
and ill thought out

17:39.726 --> 17:41.692
could only be the work
of an angry liberal.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.494
(gasps)
Maxine!

17:43.496 --> 17:46.064
My ex is using the thing
I hate most against me--

17:46.066 --> 17:47.532
big government.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.866
(grunts)

17:48.868 --> 17:50.535
(camera shutter clicking)

17:50.537 --> 17:52.003
Stop this
ribbon cutting!

17:52.005 --> 17:53.704
This is private property!

17:53.706 --> 17:55.573
What's the matter,
Mr. Burns?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.042
Never heard
of eminent domain?

17:58.044 --> 18:00.545
You're just doing this to get
back at me for dumping you!

18:00.547 --> 18:03.081
That is ridiculous.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.852
(gasps)

18:07.854 --> 18:10.188
The Antonin Scalia bedroom!

18:10.190 --> 18:13.391
It's a National Public Radio
broadcast center now.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.059
Who are you?

18:15.061 --> 18:18.029
I'm Robert Siegel, and this is
<i>All Things Considered.</i>

18:18.031 --> 18:20.498
(theme music playing)

18:26.405 --> 18:28.372
Stop laying about, you!

18:28.374 --> 18:29.707
There's work to be done!

18:29.709 --> 18:31.776
(weakly):
Or Gravy Thursday.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.744
If that woman thinks
she's been scorned now,

18:33.746 --> 18:36.180
she ain't seen nothing yet!

18:44.556 --> 18:45.957
(clacking)

18:45.959 --> 18:48.126
It's fracking time.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.094
(squeaking)

18:50.096 --> 18:52.396
(whooshing)

18:52.398 --> 18:55.466
(rumbling)

18:55.468 --> 18:57.468
(groaning)

18:57.470 --> 18:59.637
(Bart groaning)

18:59.639 --> 19:01.706
(grunts)

19:03.142 --> 19:04.408
(groans)

19:04.410 --> 19:08.579
Is one of the side effects
of fracking earthquakes?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.481
(voice shaking):
Yes!

19:10.483 --> 19:12.717
(rumbling continues)

19:13.986 --> 19:15.820
What are you doing?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.755
You're destroying
this neighborhood.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.424
Just like
you destroyed my mansion.

19:20.426 --> 19:24.795
I don't know what I ever saw in
you, you planet-ruining monster!

19:24.797 --> 19:28.166
Likewise,
you planet-saving succubus!

19:28.168 --> 19:30.301
(metallic rattling)

19:30.303 --> 19:34.338
Homer, turn off
that horrible machine!

19:34.340 --> 19:37.008
You don't know anything
about hydraulic fracturing!

19:37.010 --> 19:39.777
You've just been brainwashed
by liberal TV shows

19:39.779 --> 19:42.446
who use fracking
as an easy bad guy,

19:42.448 --> 19:44.949
but it can save this country!

19:44.951 --> 19:47.618
Our... water... was...

19:47.620 --> 19:49.954
on... fire!

19:49.956 --> 19:52.957
Wait. I finally get
what you're saying.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.160
Fracking <i>is</i> great,
but the only place

19:56.162 --> 20:00.298
it should ever happen
is in other people's towns!

20:00.300 --> 20:01.699
Hmm.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.367
(grunting)

20:06.872 --> 20:08.739
(whooshing)

20:10.642 --> 20:12.877
(grunting nervously)

20:20.319 --> 20:23.788
You always do
the right thing... sort of.

20:25.324 --> 20:26.991
What is he doing?

20:26.993 --> 20:29.060
He was furious at that woman,
now he's embracing her.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.329
He told me himself
they had nothing in common.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.364
Nothing except passion.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.533
Mm.
(cracking)

20:35.535 --> 20:37.235
(hearts beating)

20:37.237 --> 20:39.570
I was a fool
to break up with you, Maxine.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.506
I'm sorry I turned your home
into a liberal paradise.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.343
You think we could
make <i>us</i> work?

20:45.345 --> 20:47.845
I don't know.
We're pretty different.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.548
But we've got passion,
and as long as we've got that,

20:50.550 --> 20:53.517
our lives will never
get boring.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.653
Mmm.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.689
Well, there's free
jazz on Saturdays

20:58.691 --> 21:00.224
at the art museum.

21:00.226 --> 21:03.527
Now they say omega-3 pills
are bad for you.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.931
My sister's dog
had puppies.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.767
What kind?
What kind of what?

21:09.769 --> 21:12.270
What kind of dog
does your sister have?

21:12.272 --> 21:14.438
I don't know.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.556
What color drawer
pulls did you want?

21:32.558 --> 21:36.127
Nickel or brush nickel?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.896
Oh, I wish we'd bought the more
expensive theater tickets.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.966
I'll never see anything
in row BB.

21:43.935 --> 21:47.805
There's a sale on lawn
furniture at the Lawns Plus.

21:50.409 --> 21:53.110
Why are all cars
black or gray now?

21:53.112 --> 21:55.980
It's like if you see
a red one, it's a big deal.

21:59.951 --> 22:02.553
I'm thinking about
wearing a watch again.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.661
Shh!
