WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:04.671
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.755 --> 00:08.258
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.342 --> 00:11.553
But where are
those good old-fashioned values

00:11.637 --> 00:14.306
On which we
used to rely?

00:14.389 --> 00:17.893
Lucky there's
a family guy

00:17.976 --> 00:21.438
Lucky there's
a man who positively can do

00:21.522 --> 00:23.148
All the things
that make us

00:23.232 --> 00:24.900
Laugh and cry

00:24.983 --> 00:29.863
He's a family guy

00:34.493 --> 00:36.119
Chris, did you get
your homework done?

00:36.203 --> 00:37.246
Yup.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.414
Chris, I know when
you're lying to me.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.499
Just like Santa
Claus knows

00:40.582 --> 00:41.583
when you're sleeping.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.668
(bangs)

00:42.835 --> 00:43.836
(gasp) What was that?

00:43.919 --> 00:45.337
Hey, what the hell?

00:45.420 --> 00:46.672
Uh, hey.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.466
-Get out of here!
-Okay, okay!

00:49.550 --> 00:51.885
No, Mom. I got
it all done.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.095
For my science homework,

00:53.178 --> 00:55.222
I had to make a shoe
box diarrhea

00:55.305 --> 00:56.974
of the evolution of man.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.684
You mean diorama?

00:59.768 --> 01:00.769
Uh-oh.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.646
Hey, Lois, I got your
pregnancy test.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.939
What the hell
you need this for?

01:04.022 --> 01:05.482
I need it because
I think

01:05.566 --> 01:06.775
I might be pregnant.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.068
What? My God,

01:08.151 --> 01:09.152
are you sure it's yours?

01:09.278 --> 01:10.404
Lois pregnant?

01:10.487 --> 01:11.613
I didn't think
the fat man

01:11.697 --> 01:13.198
still had that kind
of marksmanship.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.868
But that's what they
said about Lee Harvey Oswald.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.578
Hey, Mr. President!

01:17.661 --> 01:20.706
Mr. President, up here!
I voted for you!

01:20.789 --> 01:21.790
Wait a minute.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.667
That guy on the grassy
knoll's got a gun.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.294
He's gonna
shoot the President.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.421
Holy smokes! I've
got to do something.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.714
All right, Lee.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.675
Time to become
an American hero.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.515
(sigh) Okay, one
more minute,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.267
and then if there
are two pink lines...

01:40.350 --> 01:41.685
Oh, God, I hope
you're not pregnant.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.895
We can't afford
another kid.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.147
We already got Chris,
Stewie, Richie,

01:45.230 --> 01:47.482
Joanie, Greg, Marcia,
Bobby, Jan,

01:47.566 --> 01:49.276
Mike Seaver,
Carol Seaver,

01:49.359 --> 01:51.069
Boner, Urkel,
Mr. Furley...

01:51.153 --> 01:52.279
Peter, those aren't
your kids.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.405
That's the
Nick at Nite lineup.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.698
Blanka, Zangief,

01:54.781 --> 01:56.491
Chun-Li, Guile,
E. Honda...

01:56.575 --> 01:57.618
That's Street Fighter.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.869
Red, blue, green.

01:58.952 --> 01:59.953
Those are colors.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.623
God, I can't believe
we weren't more careful.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.542
This probably
happened that night we tried role-playing.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.045
Oh, I need a spanking.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.547
I'm a bad, bad girl.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.885
I'm a paladin
with 18 charisma and 97 hit points.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.764
I can use my helm
of disintegration and do 1-D-4 damage

02:18.847 --> 02:22.893
as my half-elf mage
wields his plus-5 Holy Avenger.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.729
Paladins can't use the
helm of disintegration.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.191
Oh. Okay, then
I'm a black guy.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.151
Oh, thank God.
It's negative.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.237
Ooh! Dodged a
bullet there, right?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.530
Although, I got
to tell you,

02:34.613 --> 02:35.906
I was kind of getting
used to the idea

02:35.989 --> 02:37.616
of having a little
brother or sister.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.035
Peter, we can't risk
these things any more.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.411
You're absolutely right.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.205
Lois, you're getting
your tubes tied.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.082
Why should I
get my tubes tied?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.542
You should
get a vasectomy.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.335
First of all,
I don't know what that is,

02:48.418 --> 02:50.254
and, second of all,
no freaking way.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.588
Peter, it's the
male equivalent

02:51.672 --> 02:53.006
of a woman getting
her tubes tied,

02:53.090 --> 02:55.217
except, it's actually
a lot quicker and safer.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.426
Let these guys explain.

02:56.510 --> 03:02.391
A vasectomy's
a medical procedure

03:02.474 --> 03:06.103
One that makes you
half a man

03:06.186 --> 03:08.856
You're half a man

03:08.939 --> 03:11.942
Remember when
you twisted up

03:12.025 --> 03:13.735
Your garden hose?

03:13.819 --> 03:18.240
Well, essentially
that is the plan

03:18.323 --> 03:22.119
That is the plan

03:22.202 --> 03:24.830
Well, I'm starting
to get the picture, but how's it done?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.290
-(music playing)
-(vocalizing music)

03:26.373 --> 03:29.793
You make a
small incision in the scrotal skin

03:29.877 --> 03:31.712
Isolate the
vas and then...

03:31.795 --> 03:33.797
Isolate the vas
and then you

03:33.881 --> 03:37.676
Roll it in position
with a towel clamp

03:37.759 --> 03:39.469
Then you snip
the fibrous tissue

03:39.553 --> 03:41.430
Then you snip
the fibrous tissue

03:41.513 --> 03:44.850
Hey, then you'll never
have to wear a condom

03:44.933 --> 03:49.271
When you do it
with your wife

03:49.354 --> 03:51.565
Or anyone else
you do it with

03:51.648 --> 03:53.442
We promise
not to tell

03:53.525 --> 03:55.569
Like that new
hot chick at work

03:55.652 --> 03:57.946
You know, the
one who always has high beams

03:58.030 --> 04:00.157
Under her ribbed,
white, cotton t-shirt

04:00.240 --> 04:03.702
But then stares
daggers at you for checking her out

04:03.785 --> 04:05.829
And it's, like, "Why
do you wear that

04:05.913 --> 04:07.497
if you don't
want attention?"

04:07.581 --> 04:09.625
But you know
you shouldn't think that way

04:09.708 --> 04:11.502
Because of the
sexual-harassment meeting

04:11.585 --> 04:12.920
You all had to go to

04:13.003 --> 04:16.006
Seriously, how lame
was that?

04:16.089 --> 04:19.009
And you couldn't
help but notice that the female lawyer

04:19.092 --> 04:21.553
Running the seminar
had a huge rack

04:21.637 --> 04:23.847
Like, ridiculously
huge for someone

04:23.931 --> 04:26.350
Who has to talk about
that kind of stuff

04:26.433 --> 04:33.190
Well, I guess
that's the definition of the word, "Irony"

04:33.273 --> 04:35.943
Good-bye
Say good-bye to manhood

04:36.026 --> 04:37.778
-Good-bye
-Say good-bye to babies

04:37.861 --> 04:40.197
Say good-bye
to kids like Meg

04:40.280 --> 04:42.115
Vacuum out your sac

04:45.786 --> 04:48.080
Well, guys,
my vasectomy is tomorrow.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.540
You poor bastard.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.751
After all, sex
is pointless without potency.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.837
That's right. You
take the venom out of a cobra

04:54.920 --> 04:56.046
and what do you got?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.215
You got a-- a belt.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.842
It's not that
big a deal.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.594
A bunch of the guys
on the force have had vasectomies,

05:02.678 --> 05:04.596
and their lives haven't
changed at all.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.889
Would you
ever have one?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.724
Never!

05:09.518 --> 05:10.727
Well, yeah. But what
if me and Lois

05:10.811 --> 05:12.229
do end up wanting
another baby?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.313
It'll be too late.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.815
You could freeze
some of your sperm

05:14.898 --> 05:16.400
at the sperm bank
just in case.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.484
I don't know,
Cleveland.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.652
It didn't work
out so great

05:18.735 --> 05:20.237
that time I
froze my nuts.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.239
(sniffing, grunting)

05:22.322 --> 05:25.117
No! No! Bad squirrel.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.577
Those are my nuts.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.120
-My nuts!
-(whimpers)

05:28.203 --> 05:30.998
You're just a hungry
little fellow, aren't you?

05:31.081 --> 05:32.583
But those are my nuts!

05:32.666 --> 05:34.751
-(snarl)
-No. Oh, God, no!

05:34.835 --> 05:36.128
My nuts! My nuts!

05:38.964 --> 05:41.383
-Hey, Brian. You want to play tag?
-No.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.467
-Freeze tag?
-No.

05:42.551 --> 05:43.844
-TV tag?
-No.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.512
If I can get some
guys, you want to play Red Rover?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.514
No. Maybe. You get
the guys first.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.016
We'll talk about it.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.436
No! Jungle gym mine!

05:52.519 --> 05:54.438
Hey, where'd you get
the Pete Rose haircut?

05:54.521 --> 05:57.482
(groans, crying)

05:57.566 --> 06:00.444
Anyone else want
to feel my Reebok in their grapes?

06:01.486 --> 06:03.280
Then you'll all
do as I say.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.782
-Hi.
-Well, hello there.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.950
(crying)

06:07.034 --> 06:08.493
Yes, that's right, cry.

06:08.577 --> 06:11.205
Cry like Sauron
when he lost his contact lens.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.290
Nobody move!
Nobody move!

06:13.373 --> 06:14.708
Does-D--Does
anybody see it?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.960
It might be stuck
to a tree or a rock.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.170
Anyone?

06:18.253 --> 06:20.130
Oh, I am so grounded.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.467
Hi, there. Peter Griffin.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.010
I've got an appointment

06:25.093 --> 06:28.222
to, uh, banish
a White Russian from my Kremlin.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.098
Well, we don't have
empty rooms right now,

06:30.182 --> 06:31.183
but if you'll
have a seat...

06:31.266 --> 06:34.102
Yeah. I kind of
warmed myself up

06:34.186 --> 06:35.729
in the car if you
catch my drift.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.940
I could put you in
the storage freezer.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.483
That'll work.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.778
Nurse, I've got
a splinter.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.738
Just come out
whenever you're done.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.993
Oh, God! Oh,
God! Oh, God!

06:50.077 --> 06:51.370
(Peter yells)

06:51.453 --> 06:53.288
PETER: Oh, God! I...

06:53.372 --> 06:55.374
I think I feel
them moving.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.168
Hi. My partner and I
want to have a baby.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.878
We'd like a
vial of sperm

06:59.962 --> 07:01.338
and an applicator
that looks like

07:01.421 --> 07:03.298
Jodie Foster's knuckles.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.717
Certainly. Let me
just go to the freezer.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.930
Mr. Griffin,
y-you were in there an awfully long time.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.014
Are you all right?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.224
Yup, yup. Fine, fine.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.351
And just so you know,
everything in there

07:14.434 --> 07:16.353
is exactly the way
it was when I went in.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.230
There is absolutely
zero chance

07:18.313 --> 07:19.523
that I spilled
all the jars

07:19.606 --> 07:21.275
and had to refill them
with my own sperm.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.693
Zero chance!

07:23.902 --> 07:25.988
(thunder)

07:26.071 --> 07:30.701
(screaming and groaning)

07:30.784 --> 07:31.952
It's a boy!

07:34.121 --> 07:36.957
Victory shall be mine!

07:44.506 --> 07:46.466
TV ANNOUNCER: We now
return to Tony Danza

07:46.550 --> 07:49.511
and Sylvester
Stallone in What?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.722
-(speaks)
-(speaks)

07:51.805 --> 07:54.850
(babbles)

07:54.933 --> 07:56.143
(babbles)

08:02.608 --> 08:04.568
Peter, we have to talk.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.778
We haven't had sex
since your vasectomy.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.530
Yeah, I just don't
feel like it, Lois,

08:08.614 --> 08:10.657
seeing as how I'm not
a real man any more.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.410
Honey, it was just
a simple operation.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.621
It's no reason
to give up on your sex life.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.207
I don't know, Lois.
I'm just not feeling it any more.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.417
Besides, it gives me
time to try new things,

08:20.501 --> 08:22.544
like that time I tried
wearing adult diapers.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.213
Hey, Lois. Hey, kids.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.797
Oh, boy, that
smells delicious.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.424
You know, I'd love to
stay and eat with you,

08:27.508 --> 08:28.550
but I got to go
meet Cleveland,

08:28.634 --> 08:30.177
Joe, and Quagmire
down at...

08:33.555 --> 08:35.349
the bar. So just
put my dinner

08:35.432 --> 08:37.267
in the fridge
and I'll heat it up later.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.727
Love you.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.106
You, go get me
an ice cream.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.274
You, clear the slide.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.400
I'm going down
in five minutes.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.861
You! Did you get me
my Cheez Whiz, boy?

08:49.404 --> 08:50.697
You're my boyfriend.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.074
Yes, dear.
Of course I am.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.243
Now, where's Lloyd
with our Fun Dip?

08:54.326 --> 08:55.577
Good God! Running
an empire

08:55.661 --> 08:57.329
is harder than
finding diversity

08:57.412 --> 08:59.373
in the Abercrombie
& Fitch catalog.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.878
STEWIE: Ooh! Ooh!
There he is. There he is. Right there.

09:04.962 --> 09:05.963
BRIAN: Ah, found him.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.881
That was a tricky one.

09:07.965 --> 09:08.966
(children chatter)

09:09.049 --> 09:10.050
GIRL: No kidding.
He looks weird.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.135
What the deuce is
all the commotion?

09:13.011 --> 09:14.721
All right. Out of my
way. Move aside.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.558
What the hell is so
bloody fascinating?

09:17.641 --> 09:19.309
(gasp) You!

09:19.393 --> 09:20.811
Well, well, well.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.230
If it isn't my
half-brother Stewie!

09:23.313 --> 09:26.400
Bertram! I haven't
seen you since our microscopic encounter.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.735
How the deuce
did you get out of Peter's testicles?

09:28.819 --> 09:30.320
-He donated sperm.
-Gross.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.364
Well, I don't
mean to be a discourteous host,

09:32.447 --> 09:33.699
but this is
my playground.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.033
I rule this territory.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.619
My, my! What
an amusingly misguided view.

09:37.703 --> 09:40.205
Very well, then. You
leave me no choice

09:40.289 --> 09:41.874
but to declare war!

09:41.957 --> 09:43.667
So be it.
I'll do to you

09:43.750 --> 09:46.336
what B.C. does to
comedy on a daily basis.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.547
(speaks)

09:48.630 --> 09:50.966
(speaks)

09:51.049 --> 09:53.010
(speaks)

09:54.219 --> 09:56.388
(forced laugh)

09:58.140 --> 10:00.893
Hey, boys. You having
a midnight snack?

10:00.976 --> 10:02.186
-Hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.605
I'm just gonna
grab something, too, and go back to bed

10:04.688 --> 10:07.107
alone... again.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.775
Night!

10:08.859 --> 10:10.611
You know, Lois has
gotten kind of fat

10:10.694 --> 10:12.321
since you guys
stopped having sex.

10:12.404 --> 10:16.116
It might be
time to, you know, have some sex.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.368
You know, at first I didn't want to do it
'cause of the vasectomy.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.121
But now it's just...
I mean, look at her.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.040
She's got elbow
cleavage.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.791
You know, that
little wrinkle

10:24.875 --> 10:26.418
that fat people
get on their elbows

10:26.502 --> 10:27.586
that looks like a schwa?

10:27.669 --> 10:29.588
I mean, you wouldn't
have sex with her, would you?

10:29.671 --> 10:31.048
-Oh, yeah, I would.
-Really?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.050
Oh, yeah. Oh,
yeah. I would do everything to her.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.468
I don't care
what she looks like.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.928
I would wreck
that chick.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.888
Well, you are
a trooper.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.142
Sorry. Fat wife
coming through.

10:42.226 --> 10:44.478
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. Fat wife.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.188
Oh, hold on a sec.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.567
All right, bring
her through.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.777
Peter, stop it.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.987
For God's sakes, you're
embarrassing me.

10:54.071 --> 10:55.239
Not as embarrassed
as I was

10:55.322 --> 10:57.741
when I got that
job entertaining prison inmates.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.117
Do it again, Griffin.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.078
Come on. I just did it,
like, five times.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.287
Do it!

11:02.371 --> 11:04.831
My milkshake
brings all the boys to the yard

11:04.915 --> 11:07.000
And they're, like,
it's better than yours

11:07.084 --> 11:08.877
Damn right,
it's better than yours

11:08.961 --> 11:12.589
I can teach you
but I have to charge(sobs)

11:12.673 --> 11:14.132
Look, honey,
with all due respect,

11:14.216 --> 11:15.801
you've gained
some weight recently.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.761
It's 5 pounds
at the most.

11:17.845 --> 11:18.846
It's not a big deal.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.180
It's a slippery
slope, Lois.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.349
You start with 5 pounds
and then one day, boom!

11:22.432 --> 11:23.725
You wake up
and you're on The Practice

11:23.809 --> 11:25.352
-with 16 rings in your ear.
-(scoffs)

11:25.435 --> 11:27.855
You're one to talk.
Look how fat you are.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.356
Lois, men aren't fat.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.941
Only fat women are fat.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.276
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

11:32.359 --> 11:34.361
I have to go warn
the chef that you've arrived.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.407
He wants fat?
I'll show him fat.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.326
The only reason
I'm eating anyway is because of him.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.953
He won't touch me.

11:44.830 --> 11:45.956
Do you think I'm fat?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.666
Only if you think
I'm a serial killer.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.834
-What?
-Nothing.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.211
Attention, all hands.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.088
We're going to launch
a massive air strike

11:53.172 --> 11:54.548
against Bertram
and his army.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.300
Behold the armada.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.013
It's quite simple,
actually.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.931
You press the smiling
duck to take off,

12:03.015 --> 12:05.225
the cow with the bow
tie to fire weapons,

12:05.309 --> 12:08.520
and the clown face
is just a clown face. Enjoy it.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.230
Now, battle stations,
everyone!

12:11.273 --> 12:12.274
(engines start)

12:12.482 --> 12:15.402
At my signal,
unleash hell!

12:29.875 --> 12:31.418
What took you so long?

12:31.502 --> 12:33.170
What took you so ugly?

13:21.218 --> 13:22.219
Well, now what?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.470
-You want to play 20 questions?
-Sure.

13:23.554 --> 13:24.888
-Uh, is it a man?
-Yes.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.014
-Is he famous?
-Yes.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.099
-Is he under 40?
-No.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.183
-Over 40?
-Yes.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.268
-On television?
-Yes.

13:29.393 --> 13:30.644
-On television now?
-No.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.937
-In the past 20 years?
-Yes.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.897
-Is it Richard Mulligan?
-Yes!

13:34.648 --> 13:35.732
Up until now,

13:35.816 --> 13:37.317
we've been fighting
Bertram on his terms.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.987
Whoa, easy.
Easy, girl. Easy, easy, easy.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.488
But I propose
an invasion.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.490
We've got to
fight him over there by the swing set

13:43.574 --> 13:45.409
so we don't have to
fight him here at the sandbox.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.535
Stewie?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.078
What's this?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.082
A letter of
surrender. We did it.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.917
Whew! It's a good
thing too, because

13:54.001 --> 13:55.669
I really didn't
have an exit strategy.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.045
Yay, Stewie!

13:57.129 --> 13:58.964
Oh, thank you,
darling. I...

13:59.047 --> 14:00.340
What is this? Makeup?

14:00.424 --> 14:01.550
Why are you
wearing makeup?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.303
(gasp) Chicken pox!

14:07.764 --> 14:11.560
Damn you, Bertram.
I thought we called no biological warfare.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.061
You swore on the seesaw.

14:13.145 --> 14:15.772
Aaa ha ha ha!

14:17.816 --> 14:19.568
Stewie, there you are.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.320
Oh, my God. Your face.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.906
Oh, sweetie.
You got the chicken pox.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.282
Come on, we got to
get you out of here.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.160
No. No, damn you,
I've got to finish what I've started!

14:28.243 --> 14:30.412
No-- My God,
you've put on weight.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.081
You're like one of those
Memory Foam mattresses.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.501
Look, there's my face.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.299
Here you go, sweetie.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.967
A couple more
oatmeal baths

14:44.051 --> 14:45.302
and you'll be
all better.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.803
Well, no need to
clean up when I'm done.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.056
You'll probably just
slice a couple of bananas in here

14:49.139 --> 14:51.266
and chow down,
huh, porky?

14:51.350 --> 14:53.101
So what happened
with that kid on the playground?

14:53.185 --> 14:54.436
He won this
round, Brian.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.812
But I'm going
back tomorrow.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.022
And when I've
carried out my plan,

14:57.105 --> 14:58.273
he won't know
what hit him,

14:58.357 --> 15:00.275
like that baseball team
that Peter coached.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.985
Well, kids,
just when I thought

15:02.069 --> 15:03.737
we'd never find
an assistant coach,

15:03.820 --> 15:05.239
I ran into this
drifter hanging out

15:05.322 --> 15:07.074
near the elementary
school playground.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.408
He's got a clown costume
in his trunk,

15:08.492 --> 15:10.077
so we know
he's good with kids,

15:10.160 --> 15:11.954
and pictures of boys
in their underwear,

15:12.037 --> 15:14.039
so he's probably had
some medical training.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.958
Well, I'm gonna take off
while he fits you

15:16.041 --> 15:18.168
for cups in that
windowless supply shed.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.253
See you.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.341
TV ANNOUNCER:
This Friday on TNT, the world premiere

15:24.424 --> 15:26.802
of Morgan Freeman
in The Narrator.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.221
MORGAN FREEMAN:
Ever since I was a little boy,

15:29.304 --> 15:31.849
people have enjoyed
the sound of my voice.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.810
And I figured
you either get busy talking

15:34.893 --> 15:36.520
or you get busy dying.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.522
The work is
really quite easy.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.567
Why, even right now, I'm
just sitting in a chair

15:41.650 --> 15:44.194
sipping some tea and
reading from a script.

15:44.278 --> 15:47.739
The wall is covered
with something that resembles egg crates,

15:47.823 --> 15:52.286
except they're
soft and spongy like a Twinkie.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.079
Like a Twinkie.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.372
Oh, hey, Hogzilla.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.332
You happen to
see my hot wife Lois around?

15:57.416 --> 15:58.750
No, I haven't.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.378
Maybe she's out
looking for a man who can satisfy her.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.672
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey. Do me a favor.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.591
When you go to
sleep, aim your butt the other way.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.426
Last night,
for God's sake, you farted.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.719
I felt like somebody
was sticking me

16:08.802 --> 16:11.013
with a cigarette
lighter from the car. You're fat.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.389
Shut up and go to sleep!

16:12.472 --> 16:14.224
(both grunting) Ow! Ow!

16:14.308 --> 16:16.226
Lois, you weigh a ton!
Get off me!

16:16.310 --> 16:18.228
-I'm trying, I...
-Try harder!

16:18.312 --> 16:20.898
Ow! Peter, if you just
stop for one second...

16:20.981 --> 16:22.357
Ow! Lois, that
hurts. Quit it.

16:22.441 --> 16:26.069
(moaning in pleasure)

16:26.153 --> 16:27.613
Peter, are we
having sex?

16:27.696 --> 16:31.074
Let's check.
Just lift up that fold right there.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.534
Uh, yup.

16:35.621 --> 16:38.081
Lois, last night
was amazing.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.458
It was, wasn't it?

16:39.541 --> 16:42.252
Fat sex is the
hottest sex we've ever had.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.420
There were so
many boobs,

16:43.504 --> 16:45.088
I didn't know whose
boobs I was grabbing,

16:45.172 --> 16:46.423
your boobs or my boobs.

16:46.507 --> 16:48.467
I know. It was amazing.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.260
Much better than that
night you pretended

16:50.344 --> 16:52.012
your penis was
Danny Aiello.

16:52.095 --> 16:56.099
Oh, that is so
interesting, Danny Aiello.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.644
You've got the best
Spike Lee stories.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.146
What's that?
You want to meet my wife?

17:01.230 --> 17:02.272
Peter, stop it.

17:02.356 --> 17:03.732
Lois, just say hello.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.276
You're embarrassing
me in front of Danny Aiello.

17:06.360 --> 17:09.279
Now, come here,
my fat concubine.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.406
(muffled)
Peter, I'm not even hungry.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.742
I want you bigger.
I want you fatter.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.410
It will please me.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.749
With Stewart
out of the picture,

17:20.832 --> 17:24.545
this whole playground
is under my control.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.395
I sense something.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.772
A presence
I've not felt since...

17:43.856 --> 17:44.857
Aah!

17:45.983 --> 17:47.317
Stewie, you're alive!

17:47.401 --> 17:48.819
Yes, Bertram, I'm alive.

17:48.902 --> 17:52.072
And I think you'll find
all your guards quite incapacitated.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.574
You have an
annoying habit

17:53.657 --> 17:55.784
of turning up
where you're not welcome.

17:55.868 --> 17:58.245
Well, when I'm done
with you, you're going to hate me more

17:58.328 --> 17:59.788
than the other
vowels hate "Y."

17:59.872 --> 18:02.374
If you'll turn to
Page 34 of your blue books,

18:02.457 --> 18:04.293
you'll see
our projections for next quarter,

18:04.376 --> 18:06.336
-which I can tell are...
-Okay. Okay. Yeah, all right.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.213
You know what?
I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back.

18:08.297 --> 18:11.300
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to show up.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.510
-So, what are we talking about here?
-Well, before you--

18:13.594 --> 18:16.972
(phone rings)
Oh, I'm sorry. "F," what's up?

18:17.055 --> 18:18.640
No, no. I can talk.

18:18.724 --> 18:19.725
En garde!

18:58.764 --> 19:01.016
(both giggle)

19:16.323 --> 19:17.658
Any last words?

19:17.741 --> 19:20.494
You wouldn't kill me,
would you?

19:21.828 --> 19:22.871
Thanks for helping me

19:22.955 --> 19:24.289
dig this hole,
Mr. Moltisanti.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.083
Hey, no problem, Stewie.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.417
This can be a
pain in the ass

19:27.501 --> 19:28.794
when you got to do it
all by yourself.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.630
You're telling me.
All right. Go ahead and drop it in.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.383
Oh, boy. That's
gonna be beautiful

19:34.466 --> 19:35.759
when it reaches
adulthood.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.219
Yeah. I love plants.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.428
So what happened
with that kid

19:38.512 --> 19:39.513
you were telling
me about?

19:39.638 --> 19:41.139
He admitted defeat
and ran off.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.432
What a mook!

19:44.977 --> 19:47.604
Oh, Peter,
I love you so much.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.066
PETER: Oh, Lois.
I have no idea if we're doing it

19:51.149 --> 19:52.401
or if that's
just the back of your knee,

19:52.484 --> 19:54.862
but either way,
it feels so good.

19:54.945 --> 19:58.073
LOIS: Ow, Peter,
you're on my arm. It hurts.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.617
Oh! My chest
hurts, too.

20:00.701 --> 20:01.785
Oh, my God.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.413
Peter, I think
I'm having a heart attack.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.290
Oh, me, too,
sweetie. Me, too.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.625
No, no, Peter,
I'm really having a heart attack.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.294
PETER: Oh--Oh, my God!
You're serious?

20:10.377 --> 20:11.420
Oh, we should
get you to the hospital.

20:11.503 --> 20:12.713
All right, hold-hold
on a sec.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.298
All right,
a-almost done. Almost done. Almost--

20:14.381 --> 20:15.632
-LOIS: Peter!
-PETER: Almost done. Almost done.

20:15.716 --> 20:17.759
Almost done.
Almost done. Okay, let's go.

20:19.428 --> 20:21.722
Well, it was a tough job
removing all that fat

20:21.805 --> 20:23.265
to get to your heart,
Mrs. Griffin.

20:23.348 --> 20:24.641
But you came
through it beautifully.

20:24.725 --> 20:25.726
Honey, I'm sorry

20:25.809 --> 20:27.477
I tried to make you into
something you're not.

20:27.561 --> 20:30.147
I love you no matter
what size you are.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.565
Although, I got
to admit,

20:31.648 --> 20:34.651
I'm gonna miss eating cereal
out of the dimples on your ass.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.361
Well, Mrs. Griffin,
you rest up

20:36.445 --> 20:38.322
for a few days and
you'll be just fine.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.823
Thank you, Doctor.

20:39.907 --> 20:42.659
I realize now that eating is not the way
to solve my problems.

20:42.743 --> 20:43.994
You hear that, Meg?

20:44.077 --> 20:47.539
For your information,
Mom, I don't eat to solve my problems.

20:47.623 --> 20:50.000
I cut myself.
Is that better?

20:50.083 --> 20:52.753
Chris, we all
love your hat.

20:52.836 --> 20:54.213
Thanks, Mom.

20:54.296 --> 20:57.216
Hey, Doc, what did you
do with my mom's fat?

20:57.299 --> 20:59.009
Oh, it's right here
in this storage closet.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.012
Uh...

21:02.095 --> 21:04.431
It's exactly
what it looks like.

21:06.350 --> 21:09.436
