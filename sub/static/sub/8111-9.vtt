00:03.588 --> 00:07.706
We're in the car, honey.
We're going to
the hospital for tests.

00:15.433 --> 00:19.267
We're in the hospital.
We're going to
the doctor's office.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.441
Can you tell me
what this is called?

00:30.156 --> 00:32.442
You use it
to get food
from inside.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.281
Yes, but
what's it called?

00:35.953 --> 00:37.454
Is it a spatula?

00:37.538 --> 00:38.948
No.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.821
Good.
Is it a can opener?

00:40.958 --> 00:45.247
No. It's... lt's...

00:47.798 --> 00:49.663
You're trying to
make me look stupid.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.089
You can go to hell!
Why don't you
kill yourself?

00:54.180 --> 00:55.636
Andres.

00:57.350 --> 00:58.931
It's okay.

01:01.479 --> 01:02.810
(CHUCKLES)

01:03.356 --> 01:04.937
There she is.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.056
Here I am.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.266
Here. Come on.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.485
You just need to answer
a few more questions,

01:15.618 --> 01:17.483
then we're going home.
We'll have lunch, okay?

01:18.204 --> 01:19.364
Okay.

01:22.667 --> 01:23.827
I'm sorry.

01:25.962 --> 01:27.827
l have Alzheimer's.

01:28.339 --> 01:30.000
I know.

01:30.383 --> 01:35.127
The mood swings
come on quickly,
but it's under control.

01:35.221 --> 01:38.509
Don't worry.
He's actually perfect
for the drug trial.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.053
Oh. (SIGHS)
(CHUCKLES)

01:42.353 --> 01:43.388
Thank God.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.352
We can start as
soon as next week.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.021
(COUGHING)

01:49.318 --> 01:51.855
Andres! Oh, my God!

01:53.823 --> 01:55.233
Andres?

02:30.234 --> 02:30.268
FOREMAN: Early onset
familial Alzheimer's.
Brazilian descent.

02:30.276 --> 02:33.313
FOREMAN: Early onset
familial Alzheimer's.
Brazilian descent.

02:33.404 --> 02:34.894
Blood chemistries
showed high ammonia.

02:35.406 --> 02:38.398
Vomiting stopped
after the ER put him
on antiemetics.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.232
Any recent
heaHhissues?

02:40.369 --> 02:43.076
Just a sore throat
a few weeks ago.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.662
How advanced is he?
Could be hyperalimentation.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.741
Advanced enough,
but no N feedings.

02:47.877 --> 02:50.084
The wife shut down
her floral company
to stay home

02:50.171 --> 02:52.412
and feed him
every meal he's had
in the last four years.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.337
Do we owe this case
to your guilt

02:54.425 --> 02:56.507
at having ignored
your own forgetful mommy?

02:56.594 --> 02:58.676
My guilt over my mom
is why I put up
with my dad.

02:58.763 --> 02:59.843
You're taking this case

02:59.930 --> 03:02.182
because we're running
a Phase Two trial on
an Alzheimer's drug.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.928
You couldn't round up enough
doddering, old guinea pigs,

03:05.061 --> 03:06.847
so you need us to
fix this little piggy?

03:06.937 --> 03:10.179
I'd like to sit in.
Especially since you're
short a team member.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.855
You mean Taub?
Got him in here.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.103
He asked for personal days.
His daughter's sick.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.613
Isn't that the point
of having a spare?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.107
l denied his request.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.780
After I'd already
approved it,

03:19.867 --> 03:21.368
which you knew because
I sent you a memo.

03:23.287 --> 03:27.872
Dr. Adams,
taped under your chair
is an index card.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.289
Would you read it,
please?

03:38.219 --> 03:40.460
"Wednesday, 2:43 pm.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.547
"A black pawn will believe
he's the black king

03:44.642 --> 03:48.635
"and attempt to capture
the white head
of diagnostics."

03:50.481 --> 03:52.437
lt's 10:15 on Friday.

03:52.525 --> 03:55.892
Damn it. (SIGHS)
Look, the point is,
I saw this coming.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.947
Dr. Foreman and I
did not always
see eye to eye,

03:59.031 --> 04:00.942
but he never had
the power to overrule me.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.273
Now that
he has the power,

04:02.368 --> 04:04.609
he won't be able to resist
the temptation to use it.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.615
With great power
comes great micromanaging.

04:07.706 --> 04:08.991
And great vests.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.665
I know you're
the better diagnostician.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.743
I'm not gonna interfere.
I'm only here to help.

04:13.838 --> 04:16.545
Could be
transient nitrogen load
from a GI bleed.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.042
Not if the vomiting's
persistent.

04:18.134 --> 04:21.547
Which we won't know,
because the ER put him
on antiemetics.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.592
Take him off.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.045
Wait. He was
puking his guts out.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.005
We'd risk aspiration.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.100
I'm just disagreeing,
not overruling.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.355
So glad you're on board.
Take him off antiemetics.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.353
Do an upper endoscopy
to check for bleeds.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.523
It could be
a bladder infection.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.824
We'll run
a pregnancy test.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.162
I'm not pregnant.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.578
Any type of birth control
can fail.

04:49.665 --> 04:50.950
Not mine.

04:53.586 --> 04:56.248
Oh, I'm sorry. You said
you were married?

04:56.338 --> 04:57.464
Yeah. Happily.

04:58.340 --> 05:03.255
It's okay. Sex can wane
in any marriage over time.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.381
No, no.
We've never had sex.

05:06.765 --> 05:10.804
We kiss and cuddle,
but neither one of us
is interested in sex.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.225
You're both celibate?

05:15.316 --> 05:17.307
No, neither of us.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.564
Celibacy is a choice.
This is our orientation.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.069
We're asexual.

05:26.368 --> 05:29.826
Not quite sure what box
to check here.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.120
CHASE:
You’re making a mistake.

05:31.207 --> 05:32.868
If I had the power
to veto him,

05:32.958 --> 05:35.210
given all the crap
I've put up with
over the years,

05:35.294 --> 05:36.659
I don't know if
I could use it
objectively.

05:36.754 --> 05:37.789
I do.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.336
lcan.lhave.

05:39.798 --> 05:43.006
It might be easier
if you'd stay out
of the room.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.381
I thought
it'd be different.
This week.

05:46.472 --> 05:50.181
I'm supposed to talk
to his PO about getting
his ankle monitor off early.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.677
You're saying
he should defer
to you?

05:51.769 --> 05:54.761
No. I'm just saying
what he's doing
doesn't seem rational,

05:54.855 --> 05:58.313
which makes me think
it's rational in a way
I'm not privy to.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.140
He always has a plan.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.147
And he's always
self-destructive.

06:02.238 --> 06:05.401
He may just be
shooting himself
in the ankle.

06:12.331 --> 06:16.244
I know it feels strange.
Dr. Chase is just looking
in your throat.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.667
We're in the hospital.
You're fine.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.912
That's a pretty nice
trophy there, Andres.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.508
NATALIE:
He coached youth soccer.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.173
Took a team that
was zero-and-six

06:25.261 --> 06:27.547
all the way
to the state finals
at Long Branch.

06:33.811 --> 06:35.142
Hey, thanks for
doing this in here.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.561
Switching rooms can
be very disorienting.

06:37.648 --> 06:38.979
You take very
good care of him.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.315
I love him.
Sickness and health, right?

06:42.403 --> 06:45.736
Upper esophagus is clear,
moving on to the GE junction.

06:45.823 --> 06:46.812
(DOOR SLlDES OPEN)

06:47.992 --> 06:49.983

Hey.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.989
I'm sorry,
family members only
during procedures.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.995
I'll wait outside.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.619
Oh, no, please,
it's okay.

06:57.710 --> 07:01.248
Joseph helps me
with my husband sometimes.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.544
He's a good friend.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.214
Which means not family.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.254
Wait, we're gonna
be here a while.

07:08.345 --> 07:11.508
Why don't you
show Joseph where
the visitor's lounge is?

07:11.599 --> 07:12.839
Okay.

07:18.522 --> 07:19.602
What?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.515
I'm surprised
you didn't go into
the diplomatic corps.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.817
Oh, you think they're...

07:26.905 --> 07:27.940
No.
If they're having sex,

07:28.032 --> 07:29.693
it's probably
with their genitals.

07:31.493 --> 07:35.532
Mallory-Weiss tear.
Vomiting must have
tom the lining.

07:38.917 --> 07:42.159
You know that close to
1% of the population
identifies as asexual?

07:44.423 --> 07:47.290
We really got to
get you laid.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.046
If I have to plow
that furrow myself,
so be it.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.378
I've a patient
who's asexual.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.680
Is she a giant pool
of algae?

07:54.767 --> 07:56.974
It's a valid
sexual orientation,

07:57.061 --> 07:58.551
according to this article,
at least.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.971
Yeah,
I think I read that, too.
Is that Fug/iness Week/y?

08:02.066 --> 08:03.806
She's perfectly
fine-looking.

08:03.901 --> 08:04.981
Happily married
for 10 years.

08:05.069 --> 08:07.151
To a guy who
loves penis enough
for both of them.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.440
He's asexual, too.

08:10.574 --> 08:11.939
Ran a complete
physical on her.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.275
Nothing wrong
except a common
bladder infection.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.034
Hundred bucks says
I can find a medical reason

08:20.125 --> 08:21.205
why she doesn't want
to have sex.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.794
You're out of your mind
if you think

08:22.878 --> 08:24.584
l'm letting you anywhere
near my patient.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.082
Fine, I won't go near her.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.961
Just give me her file
and any blood samples
you have left over.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.680
No contact whatsoever.
You talk to her,
the bet is void.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.305
No contact. Plays to
my strengths, anyway.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.112
Right now's not
a good time, House.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.902
Not for the Dean
of Medicine,

08:50.989 --> 08:53.366
but it's the perfect time
if you're a member
of my team.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.236
Which one are you?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.326
What did
the endoscopy show?

08:59.123 --> 09:01.034
No signs of
ulcers or blockages.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.456
(BEEPING)

09:05.587 --> 09:08.203
But you found a tear
just below the esophagus.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.378
Explains the bleeding.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.253
Doesn't explain why
he vomited so hard
he ripped his insides.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.051
His liver enzymes
are slightly elevated.
Gallstones could...

09:15.139 --> 09:16.470
No complaints of pain.

09:16.557 --> 09:20.049
Steatohepatitis
would make his AST
and ATL levels rise.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.889
Are you calling
his liver fat?

09:24.273 --> 09:25.558
Start the patient
on statins,

09:25.649 --> 09:26.980
do a biopsy
to confirm.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.932
And knock him out,
I've heard
he's a wiggler.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.107
There's no need
to put him under.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.358
We can confirm fatty liver
with an ultrasound.

09:36.952 --> 09:39.989
Well done. And now,
as a member of my team,

09:40.080 --> 09:43.117
you can make the equally
useful observations
that the sky is blue,

09:43.208 --> 09:46.666
I'm wearing pants,
and I'm ignoring
your first observation.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.125
Of course.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.916
Wait.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.468
And there it is.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.587
You're trying to screw
with my confidence.

09:58.682 --> 09:59.717
Well, if I wanted
to do that,

09:59.808 --> 10:01.423
I'd tell you how much
the nurses hate you.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.134
You're trying to get me
to define myself
as a subordinate

10:04.229 --> 10:06.094
to keep me from
ever intervening,

10:06.190 --> 10:08.476
even if it's fully
in the scope
of my duties.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.853
Like now. This isn't
about diagnostics,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.195
it's about what's safe
for the patient.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.902
Do the ultrasound.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.818
Ultrasound it is.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.983
And the nurses
love you.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.077
You don't think I knew
House was gonna tell you
to ignore me

10:26.168 --> 10:27.658
and not do
the ultrasound?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.504
This is an
ultrasound machine.

Which you're gonna use to do
an ultrasound-guided biopsy.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.018
You're letting him
get inside your head.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.974
He can do a lot
of damage in there.

10:54.488 --> 10:58.026
Dr. Chase,
he started vomiting again.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.988
This is why we stopped
the antiemetics.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.661
We needed to see if
it was still a symptom.

11:04.748 --> 11:05.908
Okay.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.411
Here. You want this?

11:08.502 --> 11:11.619
Get your hands off me.
You're taking my head!

He really
went after her.

about her "good friend."

Typical of Alzheimer's.

if they were
sleeping together.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.087
A few hours ago,
you were sure.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.380
And that's
significant why?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.083
Sorry, only the bleeding's
medically relevant.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.554
No, I wasn't
being rhetorical.

12:01.638 --> 12:05.631
If they are
sleeping together,
why do we disapprove?

12:06.685 --> 12:08.425
You're pro infidelity?

12:08.520 --> 12:09.680
She's not married.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.733
If marriage is feeding
and cleaning someone

12:13.817 --> 12:17.309
and limiting conversation
to repeating a few
simple commands,

12:17.404 --> 12:19.110
then I was married
to my pet rat.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.688
And a lot of people
owe me wedding gifts.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.690
And we're walking,
we're walking.

12:23.827 --> 12:27.240
I don't care how sick
your spouse gets,
you don'tjump ship.

12:27.331 --> 12:30.323
Alzheimer's is different.
She can't share
her problems with him,

12:30.417 --> 12:32.783
or plan for the future.
The man she married
no longer exists.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.334
Yes, he does.
He's in there.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.503
This is why
you get married.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.255
Said the divorced woman
to the divorced man.

12:39.343 --> 12:43.586
I didn'tjump ship.
My husband sank it
when he cheated on me.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.261
Commitment's
not conditional.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.182
She is there for him
in the only way
that matters now.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.595
She gave up her life
to take care of him.

12:49.686 --> 12:50.801
Proves she's an idiot.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.103
If she had any sense,
she'd have stuck him
in a facility

12:53.190 --> 12:54.600
and jumped
on that strange...

12:54.691 --> 12:57.307
Dr. Foreman.
We were just
looking for you.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.313
I was right about
the antiemetics.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.689
If we kept him on them
like I said,

13:00.822 --> 13:02.733
he wouldn't have
gotten agitated
and punched his wife.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.403
Yes, we're back
to my supposed
diabolical plan

13:05.494 --> 13:07.280
to shake
yourconﬁdence.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.532
Let's see if this helps.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.997
If you're speaking
as a team member,

13:12.084 --> 13:13.415
then I'd say
you're a moron.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.204
'Cause taking him
off the antiemetics

13:15.295 --> 13:17.160
gave us crucial
diagnostic information.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.543
If you're speaking
as Dean of Medicine,
then I'd say you're a moron.

13:20.676 --> 13:23.213
'Cause your micromanaging
kept us from doing a biopsy.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.882
And ifwe had,
the patient would've been
anesthetized hours ago

13:26.014 --> 13:28.630
thus unable to go
all Chris Brown
on her ass.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.558
Unless one of
your index cards
actually predicted

13:31.687 --> 13:32.893
the guy was
gonna punch his wife,

13:33.021 --> 13:36.058
everything you're saying is
post hoc rationalization.

13:36.191 --> 13:39.729
Dr. Park,
would you please reach
under that chair?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.071
"The patient will
punch his wife."

13:46.910 --> 13:48.741
You clearly wrote that
after the fact.

13:50.038 --> 13:53.280
Dr. Adams,
would you please
reach into my pants?

13:59.631 --> 14:02.714
"Dr. Blackenshmurtz
will accuse me

14:02.801 --> 14:05.508
"of writing
about the punch
after the fact."

14:05.595 --> 14:07.381
And look,
there's a photograph of me

14:07.472 --> 14:10.589
holding a newspaper
dated last Tuesday.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.091
How could I have
gotten my hands
on that?

14:12.227 --> 14:15.594
You done?
Rhabdomyolysis
fits the vomiting,

14:15.689 --> 14:17.099
pigmenturia
and renal failure.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.393
No muscle symptoms
and urine had
no myoglobin.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.444
TTP fits, though.

14:22.112 --> 14:25.445
Start him on plasmapheresis.
Unless...

14:27.617 --> 14:29.778
Unless I need to say,
"Mother, may I?"

14:30.954 --> 14:32.239
And "mother's"
an abbreviation.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.201
CHASE: Fresh plasma will
replace the damaged
red blood cells

14:39.296 --> 14:40.376
that are clogging
his kidneys.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.453
That sounds hopeful.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.044
How's that feeling?

14:45.135 --> 14:47.376
I've never been hit
in the eye before.
(LAUGHS)

14:48.930 --> 14:51.307
I feel kind of badass.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.559
I think maybe
you should go.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.636
Look, I'm fine, okay?

14:58.482 --> 14:59.562
I'll see you tomorrow?

14:59.649 --> 15:00.775
Okay.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.565
We're not
having an affair.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.907
It's none
of my business.

15:07.991 --> 15:11.108
I mean, not really.

15:11.912 --> 15:16.121
'Cause nothing's happened,
but we've talked
about it a lot and...

15:17.834 --> 15:21.577
It's just really hard
doing this by myself.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.172
When's the last time
you had a full night's
sleep?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.340
Um...

15:28.804 --> 15:31.466
I don't know.
Three years?

15:32.849 --> 15:34.510
You're not gonna
get any rest here.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.267
People who are sick
are not the only ones

15:38.355 --> 15:40.266
who need to
be taken care of.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.856
CHI: Why doesn't Chase
have to be here?

15:50.951 --> 15:53.943
You think he knows
anything about women
who don't want to have sex?

15:55.664 --> 15:59.282
Hormone levels are normal.
This woman seems
perfectly healthy.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.116
What does it matter
if she says she's asexual?

16:01.211 --> 16:04.203
It's the fundamental
drive of our species.
Sex is healthy.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.958
Orgasms
oxygenate the brain,

16:06.049 --> 16:07.630
lighting up over
30 different areas

16:07.717 --> 16:10.379
and making us
forget how boring
Susie Cooper is.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.050
That last one may
not be universal.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.968
How about damage
to her spinal cord,

16:16.059 --> 16:17.799
blocking the signals
from her genitals?

16:17.894 --> 16:19.475
Sex drive is
in the brain.

16:19.563 --> 16:22.646
I suppose it could
be psychological
intimacy issues

16:22.732 --> 16:24.063
caused by
childhood abuse.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.808
She's been sharing
a toilet with the same guy
for the last 10 years.

16:26.903 --> 16:27.983
It's not the same.

16:28.071 --> 16:31.313
Sex releases oxytocin,
it's the neurochemical
basis for bonding.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.649
And that's why
men always marry
their right hands.

16:33.743 --> 16:34.823
It's different for girls.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.027
No, it's not.
I've tapped over 30 guys

16:37.122 --> 16:38.737
and never wanted to
see most of them again.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.249
I lived next
to a Jewish frat.

16:43.879 --> 16:47.212
We are veering
wildly off track.
Please continue.

16:47.299 --> 16:50.211
This woman's life
is probably better off
without sex.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.508
Eliminates most of
her insecurities,

16:52.596 --> 16:53.961
she's immune to
most advertising,

16:54.055 --> 16:56.797
and can have honest
relationships with men.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.056
(LAUGHS)
Not a lot of them.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.760
We've run every test
and ruled out
all the options.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.312
You're gonna have to accept
she just doesn't want sex.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.764
Lots of people
don't have sex.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.190
The only people
who don't want it

17:07.277 --> 17:08.858
are either sick,
dead or lying.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.276
So maybe she's lying.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.149
You think she's had
a boyfriend on the side?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.320
For 10 years?

17:13.408 --> 17:16.616
Sticking around
the whole time?
It doesn't make sense.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.861
What does...

17:26.796 --> 17:27.956
Thirty?

17:28.840 --> 17:29.955
Everybody lies.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.969
Higher or lower?

17:40.352 --> 17:42.934
Followed your advice
and took the night off.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.261
It seems to have
done you some good.

17:44.356 --> 17:45.687
Mmm-hmm.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.277
Where's my husband?

17:56.785 --> 17:57.865
So he just walked out?

17:57.953 --> 18:00.490
All of the shift nurses
had their hands full
with a double code.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.286
HOUSE: Perfectly
reasonable explanation.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.831
Same thing happened to me.
Couldn't find my keys
for days.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.247
The police
have been notified,
I have staff searching.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.579
You told me
it was okay to leave.

18:11.383 --> 18:12.498
I'm sorry.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.800
He has Alzheimer's!
It's freezing outside!

18:15.887 --> 18:17.502
And he's sick!

18:17.597 --> 18:19.804
I mean,
you don't even know
what it is yet, do you?

18:19.891 --> 18:21.882
The plasmapheresis
hasn't had time to work,

18:21.977 --> 18:23.433
but TTP is
our most likely...

18:23.520 --> 18:24.976
Okay, I have to
go look for him.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.519
Hey. Don't be an ass.
Can't you see she's upset?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.520
No, she's guilty.

18:32.362 --> 18:36.526
Instead of being at
her husband's side,
she was under you.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.197
Okay. That's...

18:38.285 --> 18:41.072
Yeah, he already
said I was an ass.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.575
Personally,
I applaud your decision
to step down off your cross

18:44.666 --> 18:46.873
and get on with your life,
but your misplaced guilt

18:46.960 --> 18:48.245
is shutting down
your brain.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.749
We need you to sit, focus,
and answer our questions.

18:59.848 --> 19:02.134
So it's 6:00 am,
patient wakes up,

19:02.976 --> 19:05.809
and the first thing
he sees...

19:05.937 --> 19:09.771
In moments of confusion,
Alzheimer's patients
regress to old routines.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.190
HOUSE: So what would
your husband do
on a Saturday morning?

19:12.569 --> 19:15.106
Nothing. Be at home.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.482
What about a year ago,
five years, or 10?

19:18.408 --> 19:19.693
I don't know.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.192
He trained for
a marathon once.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.074
Soccer practice.
We took a cooking class.

19:26.666 --> 19:30.079
The soccer trophy you were
telling me about, it's gone.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.250
Where was practice?

19:31.338 --> 19:34.080
It was close to here,
on Chesterfield.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.304
Okay, he comes,
he thinks he's waiting
for practice.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.557
He'd want to get out
of the wind,

19:53.651 --> 19:56.142
but somewhere
he could see
the kids arrive.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.607
There.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.698
Over here!

20:12.170 --> 20:13.706
On three.
One, two, three.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.378
Nothing.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.380
Not dead till
he's warm and dead.

20:29.521 --> 20:30.806
Get him to the ICU.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.683
Start him on
extracorporeal circulation.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.182
That'll raise his
temperature too quickly,
it'll cause acidosis.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.024
We can deal with
his metabolism crashing.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.189
We can't
reverse brain damage
if we go too slowly.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.062
Either way, if we don't
get his temperature
above 95,

20:41.157 --> 20:42.237
it's not gonna matter.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.816
Multiple warm lavage
is safer.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.195
Do what House says.

20:57.549 --> 21:01.588
NATALIE:
He has no heartbeat,
he's not breathing.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.927
How can he not
be dead?

21:05.682 --> 21:08.799
Body slows down
when it cools,
but it doesn't fully stop.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.976
We're warming his blood
outside of his body
and then putting it back.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.439
It'll raise his
temperature enough

21:13.523 --> 21:15.514
that his heart
should naturally start.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.728
Then we can shock it
back into rhythm.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.852
And if it doesn't start?

21:22.615 --> 21:23.866
Then there's
nothing we can do.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.868
You think
it's possible he knew
what he was doing?

21:33.877 --> 21:37.335
Like some part of him
gets what he's putting
his wife through,

21:37.422 --> 21:38.912
so he tried to...
Kill himself?

21:40.049 --> 21:42.040
It's what I'd do
if I were him.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.966
At least I Wish I would.

21:45.388 --> 21:46.969
I meant run away.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.010
You think
you should kill yourself
if you become a burden

21:50.101 --> 21:51.181
to the people
who love you?

21:51.269 --> 21:54.978
If you really loved
them back, then yes.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.307
That's really dark.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.231
It's not naive.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.779
I just believe
people are capable of more
than you do, apparently.

my baby sister.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.259
I was just a teenager.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.260
and the other half
cleaning up my mom's vomit.

have been important

22:35.480 --> 22:37.596
that you stayed
for both of them.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.519
Mom died
after a few years.

22:40.610 --> 22:44.228
It was ugly and painful,
and she went
with me hating her.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.563
My sister
ended up drinking
half of her life away

22:46.658 --> 22:49.274
and hating me
because I couldn't help.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.109
After Mom,
I had nothing left.

22:52.622 --> 22:56.490

Mom had used a gun
instead of a bottle?

Yes.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.239
"I felt like crying.

35:21.370 --> 35:24.407
"I knew
she was the woman
I wanted to marry.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.824
"And every time
I see her, I say...

35:32.256 --> 35:34.793
"There she is."
"There she is."

35:40.014 --> 35:42.175
He's still in there.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.215
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

35:46.979 --> 35:48.719
What did he say?

35:50.691 --> 35:52.682
He asked who you were.

35:56.405 --> 35:58.441
Don't get your hopes up.

35:59.074 --> 36:02.032
Have your boyfriend
get me those samples.

36:12.463 --> 36:14.169
How did you even know
to look for a tumor?

36:15.716 --> 36:18.628
Dr. House noticed
hormone levels
in your blood

36:18.719 --> 36:20.630
and consulted with me
as an oncologist...

36:20.721 --> 36:22.427
Who cares how
they found it, okay?
They found it.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.343
Are there any side effects
to the treatment?

36:26.643 --> 36:30.636
Some nausea, dizziness,
and as the tumor shrinks,

36:30.731 --> 36:32.687
there will be
behavioral changes.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.519
Like what?

36:34.610 --> 36:35.941
Well...

36:36.904 --> 36:40.271
The tumor interferes with
certain natural systems.

36:43.827 --> 36:46.944
It lowers libido
and causes
erectile dysfunction.

36:50.250 --> 36:54.584
You mean the treatment
will make me want
to have sex?

36:57.383 --> 36:58.748
What if I don't
want the treatment?

36:58.842 --> 37:00.457
I would
strongly advise...

37:00.552 --> 37:02.258
Look, you have
a brain tumor, okay?

37:02.346 --> 37:03.381
You have to
have the treatment.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.838
Okay, look,
I know who I am, okay?

37:05.933 --> 37:07.013
And I'm not one of them.

37:07.101 --> 37:09.843
Hey, look,
we'll adjust.

37:09.937 --> 37:13.145
Okay? We can go
through this together.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.599
You mean have sex?
I can't make you do that.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.400
Maybe it won't
be so bad.

37:19.488 --> 37:20.898
It'll be terrible.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.403
It's actually
pretty fun.

37:28.247 --> 37:30.158
From what I remember.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.660
But you said that...
I know.

37:33.627 --> 37:36.915
I know. Iwanted to
spend my life with you

37:38.006 --> 37:40.668
and I knew that meant
making certain sacrifices.

37:41.844 --> 37:45.052
But a girl has needs.

37:50.227 --> 37:52.343
You dropped
in the US. News rankings.

37:52.438 --> 37:55.601
With respect,
Mr. Laffont, that's only
because we temporarily

37:55.732 --> 37:57.268
shut down our
diagnostics department.

37:57.359 --> 37:58.644
It's up
and running again.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.317
I'm actually concerned
it might be because of
the change in management.

38:01.405 --> 38:04.943
If you want my money,
I'll need to see
a five year plan.

38:09.246 --> 38:10.326
Am I boring you?

38:12.541 --> 38:17.911
No, Ijust,
those flowers are
from last week.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.996
They should
be dead by now.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.170
Excuse me?

38:24.595 --> 38:25.960
Sorry, I have to go.

38:38.192 --> 38:39.648
It's Reye's Syndrome.

38:39.735 --> 38:42.397
Patient had a sore throat
a few weeks ago
before he was admitted.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.729
Reye's in adults
is a reach.

38:44.823 --> 38:45.938
Not if he took aspirin.

38:46.033 --> 38:48.194
Aspirin in adults
is a reach.

38:48.285 --> 38:50.401
Especially in a house
with locked medicine cabinets.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.827
It wasn't in
the medicine cabinet.

38:51.914 --> 38:54.326
The wife used to
run a floral company,

38:54.416 --> 38:55.826
still does a few orders
from home.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.783
She uses crushed aspirin
in the water

38:57.878 --> 38:59.709
to make the flowers
last longer.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.668
So the husband
has a sore throat,

39:03.759 --> 39:05.340
takes an aspirin
without her knowing,

39:05.427 --> 39:07.292
realizes he's
got a sore throat,
takes an aspirin,

39:07.387 --> 39:08.638
realizes he's got
a sore throat...

39:08.722 --> 39:11.179
You can stop me
whenever you like.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.342
Have Chase start him
on steroids.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.097
I already did.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.561
Then why are
you telling me?

39:18.649 --> 39:20.685
Because I wanted you
to hear it from me.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.415
(SIGHS)

39:51.473 --> 39:53.384
There she is.

39:54.810 --> 39:55.970
(SIGHS)

39:56.144 --> 39:58.100
Here I am.

40:00.774 --> 40:03.607
Your eye.
What happened?

40:06.280 --> 40:08.612
It's nothing
I can't handle.

40:21.837 --> 40:24.920
MRI confirmed
macroprolactinoma.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.088
He's doing the treatment.

40:27.175 --> 40:28.301
And the wife?

40:36.059 --> 40:40.223
Come on.
We saved a man's life,

40:40.314 --> 40:44.148
course-corrected
two people's wildly
screwed up worldviews.

40:45.319 --> 40:47.275
Notbad
for a day's work.

40:50.866 --> 40:54.825
I think they were happy,
even if it was based
on lies.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.742
Most happiness is.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.417
Better to have shtupped
andlost

41:01.501 --> 41:03.366
than never to
have shtupped at all.

41:04.421 --> 41:05.957
We can't smoke in here.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.880
We also can't summon
people into the clinic
based on a lie

41:12.971 --> 41:16.304
motivated by a petty bet,
and yet it happens.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.552
It's an imperfect world.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.312
Well?

41:31.990 --> 41:33.571
Disgustingly satisfying.

41:35.827 --> 41:36.816
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

41:37.245 --> 41:38.234
(DOOR OPENS)

41:40.832 --> 41:41.912
He said it was okay.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.082
Is one of you Dr. House?

41:45.337 --> 41:46.747
You've seen Spartacus,
right?

41:46.838 --> 41:49.830
I got an order here to
deactivate and remove
his ankle monitor.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.423
(SLOW POP SONG PLAYING)

41:58.725 --> 41:59.760
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

41:59.851 --> 42:01.102
(RINGING TONE)

42:03.605 --> 42:04.845
(OVER PHON E) Robbie?

42:04.940 --> 42:06.271
Hey, sis.

42:08.443 --> 42:10.058
It’s been years.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.438
I know.

42:12.114 --> 42:14.776
I thought of you
on Mom's birthday.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.775
Is everything okay?

42:17.869 --> 42:20.326
Yeah, yeah.
Fine. Ijust...

42:21.957 --> 42:24.699
...wanted to
see how you were.

42:24.793 --> 42:25.953
I’m fine.

42:40.308 --> 42:42.560
Bikes go faster
without training wheels.

42:46.857 --> 42:50.190
Now get out,
I have work to do.

42:57.993 --> 42:59.904
Whoops.
