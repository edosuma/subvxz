WEBVTT

00:16.934 --> 00:20.687
‐ Oh, man, I'm so hungry I could eat
a crowverine stuffed into a pigator

00:20.687 --> 00:22.064
stuffed into a kangadillo.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.858
‐ Mm! Crowverpigadillo.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.984
‐ Dinner is served.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.236
‐ And dinner is done.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.321
‐ No!

00:35.160 --> 00:36.203
‐ Uh, what's the rush?

00:36.203 --> 00:37.663
‐ We have to get to bed.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.915
Because we're very tired.

00:39.915 --> 00:40.958
Isn't that right, Hope?

00:40.958 --> 00:43.335
‐ Right, Phil. Tired. So tired!

00:44.795 --> 00:47.089
‐ I'm so exhausted
I can barely keep my eyes open.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.590
‐ Really? 'Cause you seem pumped.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.677
‐ That's a symptom of extreme fatigue.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.387
It's worse than I thought. Good night.

00:53.971 --> 00:54.972
‐ Aha!

00:56.181 --> 00:56.974
Ohh!

01:27.629 --> 01:30.048
‐ Second dinner is served.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.470
Hey, anyone else notice,

01:35.470 --> 01:37.556
the Bettermans were acting
kinda weird, huh?

01:37.556 --> 01:38.473
Especially Phil.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.767
‐ To be fair, Phil always acts weird.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.768
‐ Maybe they're just tired.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.270
‐ Before the sun goes down?

01:43.937 --> 01:46.023
‐ Sure. Living on a farm isn't easy.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.692
‐ Uh, we live on a farm
and we are still awake.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.987
‐ I bet Hope made a secret dessert
she doesn't wanna share with us.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.197
But Sandy will find it.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.198
Won't you, Sandy?

01:55.908 --> 01:56.992
‐ Or they're just tired.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.411
‐ What if they met a new family
and they're replacing us?

01:59.411 --> 02:00.370
What if we have to move?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.414
What if Dawn
has a new best friend?

02:02.956 --> 02:05.584
‐ What if you're overreacting just a bit?

02:05.584 --> 02:08.712
‐ What if they have a giant window
they're keeping to themselves?

02:08.712 --> 02:12.299
And they have trained punch monkeys
to wait on them hand and foot

02:12.299 --> 02:15.677
while they watch
wall‐to‐wall window action?

02:15.677 --> 02:17.054
‐ You're all wrong.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.805
There's a full moon tonight.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.891
That's when the Bettermans turn into

02:20.891 --> 02:24.603
half‐man, half‐bear, half‐fish beasts!

02:24.603 --> 02:25.479
‐ Too many halves.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.398
‐ 'Cause they were bitten by bearacudas!

02:28.398 --> 02:32.152
And that made them wereacudas!

02:32.152 --> 02:33.403
‐ Wereacudas?

02:34.738 --> 02:37.366
‐ Oh. Is that why
they're sneaking around up there?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.244
‐ Let's go. No noise.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.954
‐ Come on, guys,
there's no such thing as‐‐

02:44.706 --> 02:45.791
wereacudas.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.851
‐ Hey, guys. I took the elevator.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.185
‐ Pipe down!

03:08.772 --> 03:10.274
‐ Here's the plan. I grab Phil.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.525
Ugga, you wrap up Hope.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.943
Eep, you're on Dawn patrol.
Mm‐hmm.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.069
Thunk, try not to get bitten.

03:14.069 --> 03:17.155
‐ And, most importantly,
aim for the gills!

03:17.155 --> 03:21.076
‐ Or we could just talk to them
because the Bettermans aren't wereacudas.

03:21.076 --> 03:24.454
‐ Aw, I love that you always see
the bright side, Guy‐Boy.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.706
But this time it might get us killed.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.166
So less talking, more stalking.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.048
‐ Ooh. Are you sure
you want to do that?

03:35.048 --> 03:35.841
Just trying to help.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.551
‐ Don't listen to him, Mom.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.178
Dad's just trying to mess with your head.

03:39.178 --> 03:42.139
‐ Way ahead of him, Dawn.
We're married, remember?

03:42.139 --> 03:43.599
That means I'm Phil‐proof.

03:45.142 --> 03:45.684
Eh!

03:45.684 --> 03:47.186
‐ Ha! I win!

03:47.186 --> 03:50.606
Ah, the delicious nectar of victory.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.107
You two know how sweet it is.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.109
Oh, wait, you don't.

03:54.109 --> 03:58.405
Because I am
and always shall be undefeated.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.199
‐ Phil, you promised you wouldn't do that.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.159
‐ Do what, dear? Win?

04:02.159 --> 04:03.785
‐ No, be a bad sport.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.288
You said tonight would be
all fun, no gloating, remember?

04:06.288 --> 04:07.122
‐ Did I?

04:07.122 --> 04:09.333
‐ Yes! That's why Dawn and I are here.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.001
But you haven't changed at all.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.505
‐ Yeah, Dad. You're making
a shame night of game night.

04:14.505 --> 04:15.255
Game night?

04:16.131 --> 04:18.217
‐ Oh, yeah, game night. Ha, ha!

04:18.217 --> 04:20.010
I remember this from when I was a kid.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.554
The Bettermans used to
invite my family over to play games.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.056
It was‐‐ It was so much fun.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.766
‐ Sure, because games are fun.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.602
‐ So no wereacudas here, Mom. Just games.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.853
‐ What's a wereacuda?

04:29.853 --> 04:32.356
‐ Part‐man, part‐bear, part‐fish‐‐

04:32.356 --> 04:35.442
Eh, you know the parts,
'cause you are one!

04:35.442 --> 04:36.235
Get 'em!

04:39.613 --> 04:41.782
‐ Anyway, I like games.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.325
‐ Yeah, not a fan of games.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.868
It's too much work.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.412
But I'm a big fan of game snacks.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.666
Mm! Banana chips. It's not bad.

04:50.666 --> 04:51.750
But I'm not gonna settle.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.919
I'm gonna find the ultimate game snack.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.838
Because that is my destiny.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.048
‐ Uh, why didn't you invite us?
We like fun.

04:58.048 --> 04:58.715
‐ Me too!

04:58.715 --> 05:00.050
That's why I like games.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.594
‐ I just assumed
you wouldn't be interested.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.681
These games are more
cerebral than corporeal.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.434
Brain, not brawn.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.270
Ohh!

05:11.270 --> 05:12.646
‐ So it was for your own good.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.857
After all, strategy and concentration,

05:14.857 --> 05:18.360
and, well, thinking aren't exactly
your cup of bitter leaf juice.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.904
‐ From what I remember,
game night is for everyone.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.991
‐ I like games! My brain good. Grug play.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.993
‐ You're proving my point.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.036
So if you'll excuse us,

05:28.036 --> 05:31.748
Hope and Dawn
are eager to challenge my winning streak.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.125
‐ No, Phil. You blew it.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.585
I'm done playing games with you tonight.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.254
‐ Yeah, Dad. I've lost my game face.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.755
‐ Good news, Croods.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.133
A seat at the table just opened up.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.761
You have no chance of defeating me,
but it's all in good fun.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.347
Welcome to game night!

05:47.347 --> 05:48.807
‐ I'm playing first.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.143
Stack Sticks is quite simple.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.853
Take a stick from the bottom
and put it on top

05:52.853 --> 05:53.937
without toppling the stack.

05:53.937 --> 05:54.688
Like so.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.273
If I factor the stick's exit angle,

05:56.273 --> 05:57.357
calculate removal velocity

05:57.357 --> 05:58.984
to maintain
the stack's structural integrity,

05:58.984 --> 06:00.777
then consider
the load‐bearing sticks below it,

06:00.777 --> 06:01.820
I choose

06:03.071 --> 06:03.906
this one.

06:05.324 --> 06:06.658
Advantage, Phil.

06:06.658 --> 06:07.910
Your turn, Grug.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.037
‐ Ha! I can do that.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.414
‐ And I win.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.499
‐ What? But I barely touched it.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.836
‐ Yes. That's the way
the stack sticks stumble.

06:17.836 --> 06:18.587
Point, me.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.130
‐ I'm playing again.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.049
‐ In the game of Rock, Leaf, Sharp Rock,

06:22.049 --> 06:23.509
rock beats sharp rock,

06:23.509 --> 06:25.594
sharp rock beats leaf and leaf beats rock.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.513
Touch one when I say go.

06:27.930 --> 06:28.639
Go!

06:28.639 --> 06:30.766
Leaf beats rock. I win.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.518
‐ Leaf beats rock? Pfft.

06:32.518 --> 06:33.560
That's ridiculous.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.103
Rock beats everything.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.522
‐ Not in this game.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.689
Point, me.

06:38.649 --> 06:39.608
‐ I'm playing again!

06:39.608 --> 06:41.527
‐ Honey, maybe someone else should play.

06:41.527 --> 06:42.319
‐ My turn!

06:42.319 --> 06:44.655
Finally, the blue shells move diagonally

06:44.655 --> 06:46.114
while the red shells move vertically.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.741
And that's the Shell Game.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.450
Any questions?

06:48.450 --> 06:49.868
‐ Nope. I got it.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.748
‐ You moved right into my trap.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.544
Point, me! I win!

06:58.544 --> 07:00.754
Which means
I get to wear the winner's crown.

07:00.754 --> 07:01.880
Yes!

07:01.880 --> 07:05.425
No... one... beats... the... Phil!

07:06.176 --> 07:07.553
‐ Pfft! Big whoop.

07:07.553 --> 07:08.762
These games are stupid.

07:09.763 --> 07:13.058
Let's go, Croods.
We have more important things to do.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.394
‐ Like stopping the wereacudas!

07:15.394 --> 07:16.228
Get 'em!

07:16.228 --> 07:18.188
‐ Boy, this brings back memories.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.065
Thank you for a lovely game night.

07:23.527 --> 07:27.322
‐ I gotta say, Grug, you handled losing
better than I expected.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.156
I'm proud of you.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.241
‐ Aw, thanks.

07:29.241 --> 07:32.035
Now I'll be busy
for the next few days practicing games

07:32.035 --> 07:34.580
until I can beat Phil
because nothing else matters.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.456
‐ And there it is.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.209
It's just like the time
that crowverine beat you in a race.

07:41.378 --> 07:44.298
‐ Just because you beat me
doesn't mean you won!

07:44.298 --> 07:46.049
‐ You're just a bad loser, Grug.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.801
So I want you to walk away from this.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.052
‐ But I‐‐

07:49.887 --> 07:51.305
Okay, I'll walk away.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.389
‐ Thank you.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.101
‐ I'll walk away right after I beat Phil.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.144
‐ That's the spirit, Dad.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.604
We're with you all the way.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.147
Beat Phil! Beat Phil!

08:00.147 --> 08:02.649
‐ Yeah! Beat Phil! Beat Phil!
Beat Phil! Beat Phil!

08:02.649 --> 08:04.276
‐ Eep, what are you doing?

08:04.276 --> 08:06.445
If Grug loses,
won't he tear down the tree house?

08:06.445 --> 08:07.821
‐ Look, we'll never stop him.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.323
So we might as well help him beat Phil.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.074
‐ So you think Grug can win?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.993
‐ Oh, no. Dad can't beat Phil
in brain games.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.745
But I can beat Phil with the timeout club.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.956
So you lure him into the living room
and, boom, Dad wins.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.625
‐ So your plan is to hit Phil with a club?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.627
Maybe we should go talk to Phil instead.

08:21.627 --> 08:25.088
‐ Okay, but it'll be tough to talk to Phil
while he's in timeout.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.341
‐ Uh‐‐ Hmm. Mm‐mmm.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.594
‐ Game Phil again.

08:30.594 --> 08:31.720
And no whining.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.306
You couldn't beat me
even if you had hands.

08:35.641 --> 08:37.100
No licking either.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.227
Lose with dignity.

08:40.646 --> 08:41.647
Uhh‐‐
Phil?

08:41.647 --> 08:42.731
Can we talk to you?

08:43.524 --> 08:44.983
‐ Yes. Of course.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.778
‐ So Grug's feeling down about game night.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.238
He's hoping for a rematch.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.573
‐ And we'd like you to go easy on him.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.449
‐ I could.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.034
But then it wouldn't be a game.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.285
Games are for winning.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.703
And there can only be one winner.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.413
‐ Sorry you feel that way, Phil.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.832
I was hoping to do this the easy way.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.376
‐ You're right, Phil.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.379
But isn't beating Grug at brain games
a hollow victory?

09:05.379 --> 09:07.881
I mean, you're so much smarter than Grug.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.633
‐ That's true. I am brilliant.

09:10.259 --> 09:11.593
‐ Right!

09:11.593 --> 09:15.222
So what if you played
some brawn games against my Dad?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.225
That's a real challenge for a real winner.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.727
‐ I know what's happening here.

09:20.727 --> 09:21.353
You do?

09:21.353 --> 09:22.646
‐ Of course.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.898
You think I'm unstoppable

09:24.898 --> 09:28.402
and you want to bask
in the glow of my gaming supremacy.

09:29.111 --> 09:31.488
I don't blame you. Game on!

09:31.989 --> 09:34.116
‐ My dad's gonna crush him.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.284
‐ Point, us.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.124
‐ Stack Sticks struggles, stranger?

09:42.124 --> 09:42.958
‐ No.

09:44.751 --> 09:45.460
Yes.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.962
I can't stack sticks.

09:46.962 --> 09:47.921
‐ There, there, Grug.

09:47.921 --> 09:48.755
Dry your tears.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.548
‐ I'm not crying.

09:49.548 --> 09:50.924
‐ It's a metaphor.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.511
Ugh. Never mind.

09:54.511 --> 09:58.348
How would you like to play some games
more suited to your... brawn?

09:59.308 --> 10:01.101
Brawn means muscle.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.603
‐ Oh!

10:02.603 --> 10:04.021
Then you're talking my talk words.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.272
‐ Go for the gills!

10:05.272 --> 10:06.440
‐ Not now, Gran.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.567
We got games to play.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.613
‐ Our first game is Hunt or Be Hunted.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.573
‐ So... it's hunting?

10:14.573 --> 10:16.700
‐ To oversimplify it, yes.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.411
I will run and you will catch me.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.996
Ha. If you can.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.664
Catch you? Ha!

10:22.664 --> 10:23.999
This is my kinda game.

10:23.999 --> 10:27.878
‐ Indeed. Your brawn should have
no problem besting my brain.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.588
‐ Uh, heh, hunting?

10:29.588 --> 10:31.673
Yeah, more like slaughter.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.092
‐ Yeah, I almost feel bad for Phil.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.677
He doesn't stand a chance.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.803
‐ Don't be too sure.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.222
Phil would never play a game
he couldn't win.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.264
Mm‐hmm.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.350
Winning is more important
to my dad than I am.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.018
‐ Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.102
No, it is.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.437
Phil needs to win.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.606
He said he would change,
but he hasn't.

10:47.606 --> 10:50.567
And, if Phil doesn't win,
well, we're all in trouble.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.069
I learned that the hard way.

10:54.279 --> 10:57.241
I won! I finally beat you. Ha!

11:09.878 --> 11:11.630
Phil, it's been three weeks.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.006
You lost. Get over it.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.217
The farm is falling apart.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.970
So we have two terrible losers

11:17.970 --> 11:19.221
playing against each other.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.597
What's the worst that could happen?

11:21.640 --> 11:24.268
‐ Oh, I don't know. Just the end of life
on the farm as we know it.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.645
‐ Yeah. Maybe the timeout club
was the way to go.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.273
‐ Uh‐huh. Now you're talking
my talk words.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.903
‐ I've hunted my whole life.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.488
You sure you wanna do this?

11:36.488 --> 11:37.447
Yes.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.991
And put me down.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.617
Thank you.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.451
Shall we begin?

11:41.451 --> 11:42.995
‐ It's your funeral fire.

11:42.995 --> 11:43.912
Let's do it.

11:43.912 --> 11:44.746
Huh.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.582
Phil? Where'd you go?

11:47.583 --> 11:48.500
Hmm.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.210
Oh, it's on.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.211
Gotcha!

11:51.211 --> 11:52.421
Gotcha!

11:53.255 --> 11:54.131
Gotcha?

11:56.592 --> 11:57.801
Gotcha!

12:01.597 --> 12:03.557
Aw! You're not Phil!

12:04.183 --> 12:05.434
Hmph! That's it.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.852
I've looked everywhere.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.604
I'm never gonna find him.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.482
‐ That's because your brawn
didn't look here.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.859
But my brain did.

12:13.859 --> 12:14.651
Point, me.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.990
‐ W‐w‐‐ I can't believe
Dad lost a hunting game to Phil!

12:19.990 --> 12:23.202
‐ I can't believe Phil built
a fake crowverine egg just to win.

12:23.202 --> 12:24.953
‐ Oh, Phil will do anything to win.

12:24.953 --> 12:28.373
‐ Winning is everything!

12:28.373 --> 12:31.919
‐ But to be fair,
that's why I married him.

12:32.628 --> 12:35.923
‐ He once invented a game for my birthday
just so he could beat me at it.

12:36.673 --> 12:37.716
My fourth birthday.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.219
‐ I'm just glad
Phil is gaming someone else now.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.386
Better Grug than us.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.054
‐ That's it.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.096
Timeout time.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.348
Guy, create a distraction.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.225
‐ No. I'm sure Grug'll win the next one.

12:46.225 --> 12:48.018
‐ Ooh, ooh. Are those bug nuggets?

12:48.018 --> 12:48.727
I'll take some.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.562
‐ No. You deserve better.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.355
We all do.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.690
And I'm going to find a better game snack

12:53.690 --> 12:56.610
if it's the last thing I ever do!

12:59.905 --> 13:02.824
‐ And that's... rock lifting.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.243
Beat that.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.662
‐ Impressive display
of raw brute strength.

13:06.662 --> 13:10.707
But it's no match for raw brute brain.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.416
Need I say it?

13:11.416 --> 13:12.501
‐ No fair!

13:12.501 --> 13:13.460
‐ Isn't it?

13:13.460 --> 13:17.005
You used your strengths
and I used mine.

13:17.005 --> 13:17.714
Point, me.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.300
‐ Let me guess.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.052
Dad will win the next one?

13:22.052 --> 13:22.928
‐ Maybe?

13:25.931 --> 13:28.517
‐ Whoo! Big throw! Big throw!

13:28.934 --> 13:30.561
‐ Maybe you beat me before,

13:30.561 --> 13:33.689
but no way you can throw a spear
farther than that.

13:33.689 --> 13:37.359
‐ True. Lucky for me you agreed to
"enhanced throwing" when we started.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.777
‐ Because I didn't know what it was!

13:38.777 --> 13:39.987
Wh‐‐ What is it?

13:39.987 --> 13:42.573
‐ Allow me to demonstrate.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.162
Victory, me.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.874
I... am... the... game master!

13:51.874 --> 13:54.209
I'm taking your pelt
because I've bested you.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.213
It's a display of dominance!

14:01.383 --> 14:03.886
On second thought, keep the pelt
and wear the shame of defeat.

14:03.886 --> 14:04.928
Also, it smells.

14:04.928 --> 14:09.308
‐ Okay! Phil's spear went farther, Dad,
but yours went... straighter.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.642
‐ I'm proud of you, Grug.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.227
You've never taken a loss this well.

14:12.227 --> 14:15.105
‐ A lot of people say
being a good loser makes you a winner.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.481
‐ Nope. No one says that, Guy.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.691
‐ Maybe they do starting now.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.320
‐ See, Phil?
Losing graciously isn't so hard.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.654
Even Grug can do it.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.866
‐ Yeah, Dad. Maybe you can
remember this at my next birthday?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.743
‐ Why? I'm not a loser like Grug.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.995
‐ I'm not a loser!

14:29.995 --> 14:31.455
‐ Then how do you explain all the losing?

14:31.455 --> 14:33.415
‐ Just because I lost doesn't mean I lost.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.876
‐ Actually, that's precisely
what it means.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.129
And it proves
I can beat you at anything,

14:39.129 --> 14:41.548
thanks to my superior brain.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.384
‐ He's about to blow, Guy.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.514
‐ Don't worry. I just had an amazing idea.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.807
Or as some people say, a Guy‐dea.

14:50.807 --> 14:51.975
‐ Nope. No one says that.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.227
‐ Maybe they do starting now.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.353
Easy, big fella.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.604
As Hope might say,

14:55.604 --> 14:58.482
just empty your mind
and think of your happy place.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.442
Because I was thinking
we could play a new game.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.985
A game for everyone.

15:01.985 --> 15:02.945
And it's called‐‐

15:02.945 --> 15:03.695
‐ Survival.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.906
Dad and Phil,
outside the wall, on their own.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.867
No tools, supplies or food.
Who can last longer.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.327
‐ Not what I was gonna say at all.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.621
‐ Yes. Right now. Let's Survival!

15:12.621 --> 15:13.622
‐ Interesting.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.541
But you know what else is interesting?

15:15.541 --> 15:18.335
That new game Guy almost talked about.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.503
‐ Uh‐‐
‐ No more games.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.964
I can't take the farm shutting down again
if Phil loses.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.883
‐ And there won't be a farm if Grug loses.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.844
Just a smoldering crater.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.304
‐ Hope and Ugga make excellent points.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.932
‐ Oh, sounds like you're chicken seal.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.767
Oi‐i‐i‐nk!

15:33.767 --> 15:35.769
‐ That's not the sound chicken seals make.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.147
‐ That's the sound chicken seals make.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.024
‐ And I don't sound like that.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.111
Fine, Grug, I gladly
accept your challenge.

15:44.111 --> 15:47.155
And I'll win again
because I love the wilderness!

15:48.031 --> 15:51.201
‐ Quick reminder that you can't bring
tools, supplies or food.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.871
You have to survive on your own out here.

15:56.248 --> 15:57.541
‐ Oh, all right.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.584
Chunky, you're free to go.

16:02.713 --> 16:03.797
‐ Much better.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.258
Time for Survival. Good luck.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.093
‐ No, I can't do this!

16:08.802 --> 16:11.763
I mean, I can't wait to do this.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.932
‐ Ha! You got it right the first time.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.642
And, uh, don't follow me.

16:23.775 --> 16:24.693
Are you following me?

16:24.693 --> 16:27.070
‐ Me? Of course not.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.989
I love the wilderness.

16:34.369 --> 16:38.165
If I weren't already married,
wilderness, I'd marry you.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.833
Because what's not to love?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.919
Fresh air, majestic trees‐‐

16:43.754 --> 16:46.006
Brazen insects with dreadful stings.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.178
That are everywhere and favor necks.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.724
Ugh, thorns! So many thorns.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.102
Ohh!

16:59.102 --> 17:01.063
Majestic... tree.

17:12.533 --> 17:13.951
‐ Ooh!

17:20.290 --> 17:24.211
I love the wilderness!

17:24.211 --> 17:26.713
‐ I hate the wilderness!

17:32.719 --> 17:34.054
What was that?

17:34.054 --> 17:35.681
Oh. It was just the wind.

17:37.015 --> 17:37.975
What was that?

17:38.934 --> 17:39.977
Oh.

17:39.977 --> 17:41.103
Just more wind.

17:42.938 --> 17:43.856
Phil.

17:43.856 --> 17:44.857
‐ What was that?

17:44.857 --> 17:46.024
It's not the wind.

17:46.024 --> 17:46.733
‐ Gah!

17:47.484 --> 17:48.694
Gotcha!

17:49.653 --> 17:50.737
‐ What are you doing here?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.614
‐ I figured you were in trouble.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.533
And I was right. Ready to give up?

17:54.533 --> 17:55.909
‐ Not a chance.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.161
I'll be fine as soon as I start this fire.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.372
‐ Oh, you mean like this?

18:00.372 --> 18:03.333
‐ Ha! I tricked you into starting my fire.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.127
Brain always beats brawn.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.671
‐ In that case,
your brain can start it again.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.508
I'm going back to my camp.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.385
Have a good night.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.264
‐ Ha! Fire!

18:17.264 --> 18:20.100
As I said, brain always beats‐‐

18:21.393 --> 18:22.436
brawn.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.690
‐ Wilderness, why did I ever leave you?

18:27.691 --> 18:29.484
Maybe it was the screaming.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.196
Hmm. That sounds like Phil.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.742
And that sounds like victory.

18:36.742 --> 18:37.951
Point, me.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.708
Ha!

18:44.708 --> 18:45.709
Well, gee, Phil,

18:45.709 --> 18:47.211
you look a little down.

18:47.211 --> 18:48.086
In a pit.

18:48.086 --> 18:48.795
Get it?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.131
'Cause you're in a pit.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.633
‐ Oh, Grug. Heh.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.259
Thank the stars you're here.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.094
I was taken by these bearacudas.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.763
For some reason they put me in this pit.

18:57.763 --> 18:59.389
‐ Yeah, because they're gonna eat you.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.017
Bearacudas keep food in a pit
until they're hungry.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.143
‐ What? Get me out of here!

19:03.143 --> 19:03.936
‐ Whoa!

19:03.936 --> 19:05.270
That one almost got me.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.855
Sure, I'll get you out.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.107
Right after you say I won.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.609
‐ What? Never!

19:10.609 --> 19:12.110
‐ Okay. Enjoy dinner.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.613
Sorry, enjoy being dinner.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.032
‐ Fine! Leave me.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.867
But when the bearacudas eat me,

19:18.867 --> 19:19.993
I'll be in their bellies,

19:19.993 --> 19:21.328
outside the wall.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.038
So I'll be out here longer than you,

19:23.038 --> 19:24.665
and I'll be the winner.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.291
‐ Ha! You mean dinner.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.918
'Cause they're gonna eat you.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.002
Whoa!

19:29.002 --> 19:30.295
Yeah, getting closer.

19:30.295 --> 19:33.215
And you have to be alive to win, Phil.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.591
‐ We never agreed to that!

19:34.591 --> 19:37.261
‐ The game is called Survival!

19:37.261 --> 19:38.679
You can't get eaten and‐‐

19:38.679 --> 19:40.264
Whoa! Ha!

19:40.264 --> 19:41.515
Missed me.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.564
‐ Honestly, I don't know what's worse,

19:48.564 --> 19:49.940
getting eaten or losing.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.024
‐ Definitely losing.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.359
And we both lost.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.902
‐ Hmm. Not so fast.

19:53.902 --> 19:57.447
Since the bearacudas are involved,
this is now a three‐player game.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.699
So we could both win

19:58.699 --> 20:00.242
and the bearacudas could lose.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.577
‐ You sure that's how it works?

20:01.577 --> 20:04.663
‐ Yes. Because it means
we don't have to lose.

20:04.663 --> 20:05.956
It's win‐win.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.875
Except for the bearacudas
because they lose.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.668
‐ I'm good with that.
So how do we win‐win?

20:09.668 --> 20:10.419
‐ Simple.

20:10.419 --> 20:13.338
We combine my brain and your brawn

20:13.338 --> 20:16.008
in the ultimate game
of Rock, Leaf, Sharp Rock.

20:16.008 --> 20:20.179
First, we use Sharp Rock
to carve the bones into climbing holds.

20:20.179 --> 20:23.891
And you use your beastly strength
to turn the bones into a makeshift ladder.

20:23.891 --> 20:26.977
Then we wrap our feet in Leaf
to muffle our footsteps,

20:26.977 --> 20:30.606
and we sneak past the bearacudas
to freedom.

20:30.606 --> 20:31.481
What about Rock?

20:31.481 --> 20:32.357
What's that for?

20:32.357 --> 20:33.775
That's for if the bearacudas wake up.

20:37.738 --> 20:38.822
Throw Rock. Throw Rock!

20:45.913 --> 20:47.748
‐ That's right. It's Thunk!

20:49.166 --> 20:50.250
Yes!

20:50.250 --> 20:51.001
‐ It's me.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.213
‐ I always wished
game night could be like this.

20:54.630 --> 20:55.839
You know, fun.

20:56.465 --> 20:57.674
Too bad the dads are missing it.

20:57.674 --> 20:58.592
‐ Don't worry, Dawn.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.427
The dads will walk through that door
any moment.

21:00.844 --> 21:01.720
Well, my dad will.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.263
But he'll be carrying your dad.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.306
‐ I hope not.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.642
This is the best game night
we've ever had.

21:06.642 --> 21:09.770
From now on,
game night is officially a Phil‐free zone.

21:09.770 --> 21:10.646
Woo‐hoo!

21:10.646 --> 21:11.980
‐ Okay, next one.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.148
Guess what I drew.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.942
‐ Ooh. Ooh‐ooh! Is it a fish thingy?

21:14.942 --> 21:16.193
‐ You have to be more specific.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.986
‐ A fish thingy with claws?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.279
‐ More specific than that.

21:21.198 --> 21:23.033
Good guess, Sandy, but no.

21:23.033 --> 21:23.909
- Ooh!
- Hmm.

21:23.909 --> 21:24.910
‐ Well‐‐

21:24.910 --> 21:25.827
I'm done guessing.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.287
‐ Yeah? You know what I drew?

21:27.287 --> 21:31.208
‐ No. But I finally found
the perfect game snack,

21:31.208 --> 21:32.793
banana chips.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.753
‐ Wasn't that the snack you started with?

21:34.753 --> 21:35.671
‐ Oh, yeah.

21:35.671 --> 21:37.840
Well, it's not the snack destination.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.424
It's the snack journey.

21:41.134 --> 21:41.760
‐ Anybody else?

21:41.760 --> 21:42.970
PHIL and
Bearacudas!

21:43.595 --> 21:45.597
‐ Hey‐hey, you guessed what I drew.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.976
‐ Which means you won Guess What I Drew.

21:48.976 --> 21:50.811
‐ No, bearacudas trapped us.

21:50.811 --> 21:51.979
‐ They wanted to eat us.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.480
‐ Whoa! So did they eat you?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.065
‐ No, son.

21:55.065 --> 21:55.941
We're here.

21:55.941 --> 21:56.942
‐ That's right.

21:56.942 --> 21:59.987
Because Grug and I
played the game of Survival.

21:59.987 --> 22:00.779
Together.

22:00.779 --> 22:02.239
‐ And we won!

22:02.239 --> 22:03.490
Together.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.659
‐ And then I won this game.

22:05.659 --> 22:07.870
‐ What? No, I said "bearacudas" first.

22:07.870 --> 22:08.996
‐ Yes.

22:08.996 --> 22:09.872
First after me.

22:09.872 --> 22:13.834
‐ Did any of those bearacudas bite you
and turn you into wereacudas?

22:13.834 --> 22:15.335
‐ Me? No.

22:15.335 --> 22:18.172
But Phil? Maybe.

22:18.172 --> 22:18.839
‐ What?

22:18.839 --> 22:20.549
‐ Better safe than sorry.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.009
Aim for the gills, Sandy!
