WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:03.612
Previously onDynasty...I don't want to lose you.

00:03.655 --> 00:05.527
Would you please stay?I don't think

00:05.570 --> 00:07.050
that would be
a good idea.

00:07.094 --> 00:11.011
We are selling C.A. to her
husband's family, the Van Kirks.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.447
Max propositioned me,

00:12.490 --> 00:13.926
so I had an escort
pretend to be me

00:13.970 --> 00:15.711
and sleep with him
to get the contract,

00:15.754 --> 00:17.104
but then he died.
Max's head attorney Vance

00:17.147 --> 00:18.670
has the executed contract.

00:18.714 --> 00:21.325
I require the executed sale
of Carrington Atlantic,

00:21.369 --> 00:23.066
the only copy
Max Van Kirk

00:23.110 --> 00:24.937
signed before
his untimely death.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.069
Take your contract.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.723
You're gonna be
my new consultant.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.942
Say no and I go public
with the photos.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.944
You were the one responsible
for sending Kirby away.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.034
ALEXIS: This is absurd.ANDERS: You wanted her gone.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.079
You and Alexis had
an affair and a child.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.385
Kirby is telling
the truth,

00:37.428 --> 00:38.951
but Fallon
isn't my child.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.128
Steven is.
What?

00:42.129 --> 00:44.087
♪

00:49.005 --> 00:53.357
No! No!

00:55.620 --> 00:58.710
You can shove
your lying, skanking ways

00:58.754 --> 01:00.843
back into that garbage canStop!

01:00.886 --> 01:04.107
that you crawled out of!No! Just stop, please.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.848
Let me talk to Steven.

01:05.891 --> 01:09.112
Oh, I am not letting you
anywhere near him.

01:09.156 --> 01:11.506
And on behalf of my too kind,

01:11.549 --> 01:13.943
too easily
forgiving brother,

01:13.986 --> 01:16.119
I hereby banish you
from the manor!

01:16.163 --> 01:18.382
SAM:
There goes the wig collection.

01:18.426 --> 01:19.514
That's got to hurt.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.732
And acrylic nails

01:20.776 --> 01:21.951
right in the face.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.084
I'm putting a stop to this.Oh, come on.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.260
Alexis lied to you
about your real dad.

01:26.303 --> 01:27.696
Someone should kick her ass.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.219
Believe me, I'm pissed.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.656
But I can't just let my sister
kill my mom.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.964
ALEXIS: Oh! Please, just stop.FALLON: You know you're junk!

01:35.007 --> 01:36.357
Nobody wants
to see your face.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.316
Oh, Steven. You've finally
come out of your room.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.057
Someone has to handle those two.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.363
How are you?

01:42.406 --> 01:44.974
Nothing that two fingers
or two bottles of Scotch

01:45.017 --> 01:46.497
won't cure.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.065
Besides, not like
anything's changed.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.284
Takes me back
to high school

01:50.327 --> 01:51.850
when their squabbling
was my morning alarm.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.071
You meant us.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.160
Well...
No,

01:57.204 --> 01:58.770
you're still my dad.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.642
You got to admit,

02:00.685 --> 02:02.165
it does explain a bit.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.080
You and I were never
really on the same page.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.168
Or the same book.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.604
If anything,
I think it's a testament

02:06.648 --> 02:08.040
to nurture over nature.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.173
Well, I mean, Anders did do
a lot of the nurturing.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.783
ALEXIS :
No!

02:13.045 --> 02:14.786
Anders. Wait.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.180
ALEXIS:
Please! Just let me talk...

02:17.224 --> 02:18.529
Let's talk later?

02:18.573 --> 02:20.183
What about those
two outside?

02:20.227 --> 02:22.316
Eventually, they'll run out of
things to throw at each other.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.670
SAM:
Where's Steven?

02:29.714 --> 02:30.933
What's wrong?

02:30.976 --> 02:33.196
Even your hair
looks mad.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.112
FALLON:
Oh,

02:36.156 --> 02:37.505
I almost forgot.

02:37.548 --> 02:40.116
I have your insurance check
from the loft fire.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.215
$200,000? It was supposed
to be over a million.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.696
I wanted to rip it up,
but Daddy insisted you have it

02:54.739 --> 02:56.132
so we never have
to hear from you again.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.829
You won't let
me explain.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.179
Do you really think
your mother's such a slut

02:59.222 --> 03:00.789
that she couldn't keep
her hands off the help?

03:00.832 --> 03:02.486
It was a dark time.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.009
Adam had just
been kidnapped.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.228
Yes, yes, we all know.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.099
Adam was the lucky one.Fallon,

03:07.143 --> 03:09.101
just hear me out.ANDERS: I was the one

03:09.145 --> 03:11.669
watching Baby Adam
when he was taken.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.802
And in the somber weeks
that followed,

03:13.845 --> 03:16.674
I was drowning in the guilt
of having failed my duties.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.546
I was also drowning in Scotch.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.112
I was wasted.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.071
The booze gave me more comfort
than your father ever did.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.551
BLAKE:
I could barely stand

03:23.594 --> 03:24.508
to look at her.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.944
I was grieving the loss

03:25.988 --> 03:27.381
of my only child.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.558
I don't remember how Anders
and I ended up together.

03:30.601 --> 03:33.125
I tried my best to forget
how we ended up together.

03:33.169 --> 03:34.692
I can't even picture them
together.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.217
And the next thing I knew,
we were having--

03:37.260 --> 03:39.697
Relations. If you
have to define it.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.786
Oh, I'd rather stick needles
in my eyes.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.701
I fudged the conception date.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.050
How dumb was I?

03:45.094 --> 03:46.791
I asked Alexis.
She always denied it.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.706
It was for Steven's own good.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.839
It's like Downton Abbey
After Dark.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.188
And poor Anders,

03:52.232 --> 03:54.930
not getting to be a
real dad to his son.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.148
What?

03:56.192 --> 03:57.976
You're defending him?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.804
That snake my family brought in?

03:59.848 --> 04:02.242
Smiling and nodding
while he took my money,

04:02.285 --> 04:04.896
my wife and my child?

04:04.940 --> 04:07.029
Well, he's gonna pay
for all of it.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.336
Why didn't you ask
for a paternity test?

04:09.379 --> 04:12.034
I didn't know what would
happen if I was right.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.818
There couldn't have
been a better outcome.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.385
I'd always loved you
as if you were my own.

04:15.429 --> 04:16.821
I raised you as much as he did.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.910
I used to tell my friends
I had two fathers.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.477
Didn't realize how right I was.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.827
Even though the Anders
are not the Carringtons,

04:22.871 --> 04:24.394
you have excellent genes.

04:24.438 --> 04:27.310
So no inherited traits or
mutations I need to know about.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.269
Only Kirby.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.271
So much to process.

04:31.314 --> 04:34.448
I just don't know
if I can be here right now.

04:34.491 --> 04:35.971
You don't have to be.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.234
Just focus on yourself. And Sam.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.062
ALEXIS:
I need

04:40.105 --> 04:41.281
to explain
everything to him.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.500
Or you could spare Steven

04:43.544 --> 04:45.328
your tale of sadness
and seduction

04:45.372 --> 04:47.069
that just made me vom
in my mouth.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.288
Oh!

04:50.333 --> 04:52.074
Oh. Sir?

04:52.117 --> 04:54.381
Sir, park this pile of rust
by the stables.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.731
That land is hers. And until
I figure out a way to flood it,

04:56.774 --> 04:59.299
she'll stay there.I want to talk
to Steven!

05:00.343 --> 05:02.040
Sorry to interrupt.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.433
Oh, an interruption.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.609
That's what you're
apologizing for?

05:05.653 --> 05:07.045
We need to talk.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.046
I didn't sleep

05:08.090 --> 05:09.178
a wink all night...

05:09.221 --> 05:10.266
Well, that makes sense.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.094
The devil never sleeps.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.574
...knowing that...

05:13.617 --> 05:15.619
I need to hand in
my resignation.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.274
Before I do,
I beg of you,

05:18.318 --> 05:19.493
please hear me out, sir.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.799
I need to explain
my side of the story.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.366
Is that what you need?

05:23.410 --> 05:26.195
Well, I am sorry
I can't accommodate you.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.849
I have a meeting
I have to get to.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.372
And I will accept
your resignation.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.983
After you find
a suitable replacement.

05:32.027 --> 05:36.031
Preferably one who understands
the meaning of loyalty.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.208
FALLON:
I'm sorry everyone is so late.

05:39.251 --> 05:41.602
It's complete pandemonium
at our house.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.212
Yeah. Kirby told me.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.215
Of course. I'm sure she
sold the story to TMZ, too.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.825
Let's get this over with.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.219
So you're not gonna deny Steven
his shares?

05:50.262 --> 05:52.090
Wow, you've
really grown, Blake.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.657
I, for one,
am looking forward

05:53.701 --> 05:55.616
to the multibillion-dollar
payout.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.487
I think I'll buy
some more toy cars.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.923
Okay, back off, Jeff.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.403
My dad's had a
rough 24 hours.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.274
Save the hypocritical sympathy,
Fallon.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.102
You destroyed my company,

06:04.146 --> 06:06.931
just like your cheating whore
of a mother destroyed my family.

06:06.975 --> 06:09.717
I saved your company to keep you
from running it into the ground.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.197
And while you've been impotently
stewing, I've been purging:

06:12.241 --> 06:13.677
closing the deal, exiling Mom.

06:13.721 --> 06:16.114
It's called rising from the
ashes. You should try it.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.334
Wait, you threw
your own mother out?Yes.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.336
She was clinging to her
trash more desperately

06:20.380 --> 06:22.338
than a basic bitch at a
Barneys warehouse sale.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.514
Anyway, I think this could
be good for Steven, you know?

06:24.558 --> 06:25.733
Once we both get our payout,

06:25.776 --> 06:27.517
then he and I can
start our new legacy.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.084
Have you noticed
that he's not here?

06:29.127 --> 06:31.521
I can bring him
his contract.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.697
And Monica authorized me
to sign for her.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.786
So let's bust this piñata.

06:35.830 --> 06:38.310
As per prior notice,
the primary shareholders

06:38.354 --> 06:39.921
of Carrington Atlantic
are here

06:39.964 --> 06:43.054
to finalize the sale of your
company to Van Kirk Industries.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.534
Upon signing,
your share

06:44.578 --> 06:46.318
of the payout
will be directly deposited

06:46.362 --> 06:47.407
into your bank accounts

06:47.450 --> 06:49.104
and C.A. will cease to exist.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.366
Oh.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.107
Every time a
transaction rings,

06:52.150 --> 06:53.761
an angel gets
her billions.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.284
Good-bye, C.A.

we need to have
a little talk.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.001
I'm renewing my passport.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.351
Takes a village, right?

07:19.395 --> 07:20.918
Hey.
Hey.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.486
I was worried about you. You
missed the shareholders meeting.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.922
Sorry, I was on the phone

07:24.966 --> 07:27.142
to some people
from my foundation--Don't worry.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.230
Just sign these.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.492
And once you do,

07:29.536 --> 07:30.754
you'll be free of the company,

07:30.798 --> 07:32.147
free of Dad,

07:32.190 --> 07:33.931
and we can finally start
our new chapter.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.498
It's funny you should say that.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.674
I was actually on the phone
organizing a trip.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.415
See, Sam and I

07:39.459 --> 07:41.504
always talked about traveling
after we got married.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.114
You're not going
on your honeymoon now.

07:43.158 --> 07:44.289
No.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.466
This is going to be
more extensive.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.513
I have to get back
to doing what I love,

07:50.557 --> 07:52.254
so I've decided to invest
my portion of the payout

07:52.297 --> 07:53.298
into my foundation.

07:53.342 --> 07:56.171
I want to get back
to building houses

07:56.214 --> 07:57.955
and bringing clean water
to developing countries.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.523
We're starting our lives
as the new activist power couple

08:00.567 --> 08:02.394
of the world.

08:02.438 --> 08:03.613
Someone has
to fill that void

08:03.657 --> 08:05.485
now that the Jolie-Pitts
split up.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.530
Oh, God, you're running away.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.531
No.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.359
We're... moving.

08:10.402 --> 08:11.447
To Paraguay.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.451
What?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.497
♪

08:39.606 --> 08:43.000
♪ Not another Friday night
in the social jungle ♪

08:43.044 --> 08:45.437
♪ She's got the link,

08:45.481 --> 08:47.222
♪ To take her
where she wants to go ♪Ugh.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.703
Somehow, it doesn't taste
as good as I thought it would.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.531
When you snatch billions
of dollars from the Carringtons,

08:51.574 --> 08:53.228
you can buy
your own champagne.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.709
You weren't kidding
about the mess they're in.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.537
Especially Alexis.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.540
Fallon kicked her out of the
manor and back into her trailer.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.629
Mm. Trailer meet trash.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.935
I don't know.
I feel for her.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.807
There's no way Monica and I
would've gotten our share

09:06.850 --> 09:08.417
of the sale
without Alexis.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.899
Well, I can't imagine her
family will ever forgive her.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.162
Especially Steven.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.816
You don't know him, then.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.558
He's always had
a soft spot for his mom.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.343
If it weren't for Steven,
Alexis would've been long gone.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.172
FALLON:
Why can't Steven be

09:24.215 --> 09:26.740
a normal nouveau billionaire
and just move to Connecticut?

09:26.783 --> 09:28.872
Now I have to put the
C.A. transition on hold.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.135
All this just because
Steven's moving to Paraguay?

09:31.179 --> 09:33.311
Besides, aren't we leaving
for New York soon?

09:33.355 --> 09:35.400
Irrelevant.
When Steven leaves,

09:35.444 --> 09:36.750
he goes completely off
the grid.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.621
And I just sold
the company that held

09:38.665 --> 09:40.623
our family together.
I can't lose my anchor, too.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.103
Who's gonna remind
me not to turn

09:42.146 --> 09:43.321
into my parents?

09:43.365 --> 09:46.237
Well, I couldhelp you
with that.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.631
You help me with other things,
not that.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.723
I'm gonna go.Okay.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.685
Hello?Michael.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.209
Hope I'm catching you
at a bad time.

10:01.252 --> 10:02.863
Yeah, I got your package.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.213
Yet you didn't call
to let me know.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.780
You're better than that.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.912
What is this?

10:08.956 --> 10:11.393
Am I going undercover
at an antiques auction?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.134
No, I got you
into an underground

10:13.177 --> 10:14.831
billionaires poker game.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.485
That should cover your buy-in.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.661
Why is someone in the antiques
business interested in poker?

10:18.705 --> 10:20.097
Oh, I have an affinity

10:20.141 --> 10:22.839
for high-risk,
high-reward people

10:22.883 --> 10:26.234
who find themselves
in vulnerable positions.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.889
Look, I'm not that great
at poker.

10:28.932 --> 10:31.239
If I wanted to win,
I'd go myself.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.415
You just need to wear
that earpiece.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.765
Oh, and if you don't
follow my instructions,

10:35.809 --> 10:38.594
you'll have to explain to your
girlfriend how someone like me

10:38.638 --> 10:40.335
ended up with enough ammo
to reverse

10:40.378 --> 10:43.599
her multibillion-dollar sale
and send her to jail.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.079
Then again, jail's nothing

10:45.122 --> 10:47.124
compared to what the Van Kirks
would unleash on her.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.561
SAM:
So I did a quick

10:49.605 --> 10:51.563
Paraguay real estate search,
and I found

10:51.607 --> 10:54.305
the most gorgeous farmhouse
in San Bernardino.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.872
"San Ber" to the locals.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.222
We're gonna have to drive
farther out for the nightlife

10:58.266 --> 11:00.398
in Asunción, but then again
there's no traffic.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.183
Or roads, really.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.837
We're not going
for the nightlife.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.883
I want to enjoy
our expat marriage,

11:06.927 --> 11:09.494
but I know that this is about
what you need right now.

11:09.538 --> 11:12.193
Thank you
for giving this a shot.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.629
You're welcome.Speaking of shots,

11:13.673 --> 11:15.675
you're gonna need
a few before we go.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.546
Definitely yellow fever,
malaria...

11:17.589 --> 11:18.852
Isn't that just
if you're camping?

11:18.895 --> 11:21.245
The volunteers all live together
in a tent city.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.247
It's the best part. Just think
of it like Burning Man,

11:23.291 --> 11:24.814
without the drugs.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.468
How is that the best part?

11:26.511 --> 11:28.165
Time to go. We don't
want to be late.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.080
I thought we were having
a "let's talk sense

11:30.124 --> 11:31.908
into Steven" lunch

11:31.952 --> 11:33.780
I need your help figuring out
how to invest

11:33.823 --> 11:34.911
my new money before you go.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.521
The bonus?

11:36.565 --> 11:39.176
Bonding time
with new half-brother.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.004
Come on.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.440
ANDERS:
Sir,

11:42.484 --> 11:44.747
if you've got a moment,
I have a potential replacement

11:44.791 --> 11:45.966
I'd like you to meet.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.794
Hello, sir.Hello.

11:47.837 --> 11:51.449
Did Anders tell you the job
comes with many benefits?

11:51.493 --> 11:52.842
Including banging my wife?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.191
And we keep the
knives over there.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.237
That's for stabbing me
in the back.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.066
You're not gonna get
the position.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.894
But it's not your fault,
it's his.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.026
Anders thought I was
gonna be easy to please.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.159
But I'm not my wife.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.163
Bo took a dump,
and I stepped in it.

12:11.295 --> 12:12.993
Make sure you clean

12:13.036 --> 12:14.516
all the little grooves.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.175
FALLON:
What can you tell me

12:21.218 --> 12:24.787
about this $72 million lot
located outside Cabbagetown?

12:24.831 --> 12:26.136
I mean, it looks
like the perfect spot

12:26.180 --> 12:27.964
to convert
to an eco-friendly park

12:28.008 --> 12:28.922
for Atlanta's youth.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.054
Sure. Kids need parks.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.795
You heard the man.
We'll take it.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.928
Wait! Go back.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.494
Is that a horse sanctuary?

12:36.538 --> 12:37.713
"In the bucolic
Georgia mountains,

12:37.757 --> 12:39.846
"find the ideal location

12:39.889 --> 12:41.412
for race horses to retire."

12:41.456 --> 12:43.023
Steven, do you remember
how much time

12:43.066 --> 12:44.415
we spent together riding horses

12:44.459 --> 12:46.548
when we were kids?
We should do more of that.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.680
There are horses in Paraguay...

12:48.724 --> 12:49.725
We'll take the sanctuary, too.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.945
Excellent choice.
See?

12:51.988 --> 12:53.816
There are good things
we can do right here.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.687
You don't need to go
all the way to South America.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.081
I do have a farmhouse
in Paraguay...

12:58.125 --> 13:01.041
Your input is no longer needed.
Thank you so much.

13:02.738 --> 13:03.957
Well,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.570
I didn't want
to have to do this, but...

13:08.613 --> 13:11.268
do you remember this contract?

13:11.312 --> 13:12.922
From elementary school?

13:15.969 --> 13:18.536
"I hereby declare
that Fallon and Steven

13:18.580 --> 13:19.973
"are partners for life,

13:20.016 --> 13:23.106
"and will go on all adventures
together forever,

13:23.150 --> 13:25.935
"even when we're old and fat.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.155
Sincerely, Steven and Fallon."

13:28.198 --> 13:30.984
I'm pretty sure this
isn't legally binding...

13:31.027 --> 13:33.334
Well, it is signed and dated.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.118
I don't remember this,

13:35.162 --> 13:37.164
but you know
I love you,

13:37.207 --> 13:41.211
so maybe we can postpone
the move.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.214
Yay!

13:46.086 --> 13:47.957
Is that ink on your arm
from this?

13:48.001 --> 13:50.351
No.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.222
You made this today.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.095
And '95 was the year I
changed my name to Sven.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.793
Oh, God. Sven. I forgot.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.882
You are so self-serving.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.102
No! No.
Because we could

14:02.145 --> 14:03.843
have made a contract like this.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.062
I mean, you and I have
definitely said those things

14:06.106 --> 14:07.324
to each other, at some point.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.936
Anyway, this is exactly
why I need you here,

14:09.979 --> 14:12.155
so you can stop me from doing
insane things like this.

14:12.199 --> 14:15.071
How have you managed to make my
identity crisis all about you?

14:15.115 --> 14:17.552
The whole reason I can't stay
here and do good things

14:17.595 --> 14:20.816
is because no one in my family
understands how to be good.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.209
Not even you.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.819
If that's what it means
to be a Carrington,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.516
thank God I'm not one.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.049
SAM: Mrs. Gunnerson,

14:36.092 --> 14:38.312
can you please send out
a Gruyère panini?

14:38.355 --> 14:41.097
Yes, I know there will be
no room service in Paraguay.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.143
Thank you.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.492
Yoo-hoo.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.756
Have you tired
of creature comforts?

14:47.799 --> 14:50.933
It does add character,
living in the great outdoors.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.021
Take it from me.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.718
It's none of your business,

14:53.762 --> 14:56.504
but I'm practicing...
for Paraguay.

14:56.547 --> 14:57.505
Hmm?

14:57.548 --> 14:58.985
Steven and I are moving.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.943
What?

15:00.987 --> 15:02.814
Well, you can't let him leave.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.991
Not when our relationship
is so fractured.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.993
You come from
a broken family.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.472
I mean, surely you can relate.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.345
It's what he wants to do.

15:11.388 --> 15:14.174
And as a loyal spouse,
I support him.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.479
I could drop dead tomorrow,

15:15.523 --> 15:17.220
and then he would have
to live with the fact

15:17.264 --> 15:18.395
that he never made amends
with his mother.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.962
Please, Sam.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.921
Please, Alexis.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.183
Get out of my yurt.

15:23.226 --> 15:26.055
Fine.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.797
Don't forget to pack
a snakebite kit.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.756
Oh, and the shrieking
Bullet Ant,

15:31.800 --> 15:33.671
one bite and you'll wish
you were shot by a bullet.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.066
And as far as plumbing issues,

15:37.110 --> 15:39.503
there won't be any
'cause there's no plumbing.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.165
ANDERS:
I need three pairs,
size ten-and-a-half.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.080
And I'll need those today.

15:51.124 --> 15:54.083
Yeah, thanks.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.606
Oh. There you are. I, uh...

15:55.650 --> 15:57.391
just popped by to see
how you were doing

15:57.434 --> 15:59.610
after that major fail
of a baby shower.

15:59.654 --> 16:02.396
And somehow you still
work for Blake?

16:02.439 --> 16:05.094
Well, I... offered to resign.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.531
But I sense that Blake needs me
to atone first.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.316
He certainly hasn't forgiven me.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.926
Well, he's not alone there.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.320
Well, you might've stood up
for me at the baby shower,

16:13.363 --> 16:14.843
but how do you think
I feel, realizing

16:14.886 --> 16:16.714
you sent your daughter away,
only to stay for your son?

16:16.758 --> 16:19.239
That's not why I stayed, Kirby.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.370
And I will keep apologizing

16:20.414 --> 16:22.894
to you until
you forgive me.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.461
And what about Alexis?

16:24.505 --> 16:27.638
Has she managed to worm her way
back into good graces yet?

16:27.682 --> 16:29.249
That's neither your problem
nor mine.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.815
TONY:
Yeah, you called for me?

16:30.859 --> 16:32.252
Oh, hi, Tony.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.558
Um, yes, I wanted to discuss
a promotion with you.

16:34.602 --> 16:37.300
My position needs to
be filled from within.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.781
It needs to be somebody who's
fully versed in Carrington.

16:39.824 --> 16:43.306
It's kind of
a big step up from gardener.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.656
Is this 'cause you did it
with the boss's wife?

16:47.049 --> 16:49.138
Sorry, the boss's ex-wife.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.104
We need to talk.

16:59.627 --> 17:00.845
What's that?

17:00.889 --> 17:02.847
It's trash.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.240
What's up?

17:04.284 --> 17:07.287
Well, we need to talk
about this Paraguay thing.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.636
Yes, we do.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.333
Thank you. I was just
gonna go look for you.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.336
I've been thinking that...

17:13.380 --> 17:16.339
Well... we need to move up
the departure date.

17:20.909 --> 17:23.303
Watch out.
He just threw a glass at me.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.218
And the interview went...?

17:25.261 --> 17:26.784
I'm bleeding.
Take a guess.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.184
Sir, no offense,
but your behavior

17:35.228 --> 17:38.492
is making it very difficult
for me to find my replacement.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.146
Sounds like your problem,
Anders. Not mine.

17:40.189 --> 17:44.150
My problem is that
our relationship

17:44.193 --> 17:46.674
has reached a toxic level
that is increasingly difficult

17:46.717 --> 17:48.241
to tolerate.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.591
See if you can tolerate this.

18:00.209 --> 18:01.863
JENNINGS :
Blake?

18:01.906 --> 18:03.778
No, no, it's Joseph Anders.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.085
I need your help.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.356
Where's Steven?

18:16.399 --> 18:17.400
Gone already.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.923
Sam woke me at 4:00 a.m.,

18:18.967 --> 18:21.100
begging me to pack him
a trunk load of snacks.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.015
As if they don't have food
in South America.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.329
Testing. Can you hear me?

18:33.373 --> 18:35.114
ADA :
Loud and clear.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.028
Steven left
without saying good-bye.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.378
They weren't supposed
to leave for another week.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.989
I like the Bond thing
you have going on,

18:41.032 --> 18:43.209
but you need to abort mission,
this is all hands on deck.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.298
Now?

18:45.341 --> 18:48.127
Uh, the head of communications
at Bentley is in town.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.606
He wants to meet...
about the job.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.695
Th-this is is a big part
of me getting us to New York.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.915
Okay, okay. Fine.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.960
But Steven compared me
to my mother and my father,

18:56.004 --> 18:58.398
said none of us know how
to do good, which is true,

18:58.441 --> 18:59.747
but I need to prove him wrong.

18:59.790 --> 19:00.878
I just need
to make sure everyone else

19:00.922 --> 19:02.097
puts all their
differences aside,

19:02.141 --> 19:04.186
even if it kills them.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.840
And this really might kill them.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.454
We've been here for
hours, and I'm still nauseous

19:11.498 --> 19:13.587
from the three crop dusters
it took to get here.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.371
Or the three Bloody Marys
before we left.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.764
You know, I should tell you,

19:16.807 --> 19:18.940
I require hourly
30-minute breaks.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.159
And you can't say
I'm not trying.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.432
Okay. Hi.

19:34.390 --> 19:35.652
What are you doing?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.393
And how did you even get here?

19:37.437 --> 19:39.656
Private planes. Plural.
Just don't ask.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.223
We're here to prove

19:41.267 --> 19:43.051
that there's nothing you
can do here that you can't do

19:43.094 --> 19:44.313
at home in Atlanta.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.446
Together, with us.We're here for you, son.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.404
I'm not sure why he's here--

19:48.448 --> 19:50.232
taking advantage
of a free vacation?

19:50.276 --> 19:52.321
Ah! This is not a
vacation, this is work.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.410
It's fun work for Steven.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.759
I give you a week
before you're back on

19:55.803 --> 19:57.108
that air-conditioned plane.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.762
A week?

19:58.806 --> 20:00.460
I thought the whole point
of this group operation

20:00.503 --> 20:02.201
was to build something in,
like, a day.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.385
Thank you.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.473
This is a nightmare.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.778
How did you even find us?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.867
Maternal instinct.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.042
And Sam's Instagram.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.393
Steven, you can't
run away from me.

20:20.436 --> 20:23.047
No matter what it takes,
I will be here for you

20:23.091 --> 20:25.049
in your time of need.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.312
Mm.

20:27.922 --> 20:31.099
Now, who's ready
to build some houses?

20:38.454 --> 20:39.586
You need to give Steven space.

20:39.629 --> 20:40.978
I can't imagine
that you're allowed

20:41.022 --> 20:42.328
to feed the wild animals here.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.372
Don't worry, Alexis.

20:43.416 --> 20:44.460
They won't let you starve.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.419
Or she could just go
straight home.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.378
I'm sure none of us appreciate
the constant reminder

20:49.422 --> 20:51.467
of who got us into this mess.I know what you're doing.

20:51.511 --> 20:54.514
But the enemy of my enemy
is still my enemy.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.255
ANDERS:
If we could just
have a conversation.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.517
Why are you so
afraid of the truth?

20:57.560 --> 20:59.432
The day that I'm afraid
of your truths

20:59.475 --> 21:00.955
there will be
snowflakes in hell.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.348
Here we are.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.698
Okay, everyone, settle down,
you're upsetting Alfie.

21:04.741 --> 21:07.527
The alpaca, he's my
first friend here.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.398
Look at them.
They don't belong here.

21:09.442 --> 21:10.486
But we belong with you.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.792
And you're here.

21:11.835 --> 21:15.926
The foundation--
this work-- means a lot to me.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.363
And we don't?

21:17.406 --> 21:21.280
No. Our family
isn't exactly sensitive,

21:21.323 --> 21:22.629
and you brought them
to a place where most people

21:22.672 --> 21:25.066
have less to their name
than the Prada boots

21:25.109 --> 21:26.546
on your feet.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.069
Thank you for noticing.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.724
But we're not here
to embarrass you, Steven.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.247
We're here to be with you,

21:32.291 --> 21:33.466
doing what you love.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.511
And if you seeing us
in a different light

21:35.555 --> 21:37.165
changes your mind
about coming home,

21:37.208 --> 21:38.514
then I won't say no.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.516
We'll stay as long as it takes.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.649
Bet they won't last a day.

21:46.261 --> 21:49.177
♪ Flip it inside out

21:50.787 --> 21:53.529
Attention, Team
Carrington-Anders.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.401
Let's roll up our sleeves
and build this house

21:55.444 --> 21:56.837
for a villager in need.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.491
Hard hats on, everyone.

21:58.534 --> 21:59.796
Except for me. I'm
not doing that.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.538
Let's go.

♪ Turn it inside out.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.527
Uh, whoa.

22:34.570 --> 22:35.963
Did you rob a bank?

22:36.006 --> 22:37.704
Or break into
Fallon's closet again?

22:37.747 --> 22:39.488
Either way, I'd love a heads-up

22:39.532 --> 22:40.707
if the cops
are coming back for you.

22:40.750 --> 22:41.969
It's not for me.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.319
It's special delivery
for Alexis.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.755
Just a prank between us girls.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.366
Well, Alexis isn't even home.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.976
I loaned her the jet

22:49.019 --> 22:50.673
so she could get
to Entre Rios, Paraguay

22:50.717 --> 22:52.632
to help Steven
with his new gig.

22:52.675 --> 22:55.330
Hmm. Entre Rios, you say?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.376
I can work with that.

23:00.683 --> 23:01.945
Okay, Ada.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.773
I'm in. Now what?

23:03.817 --> 23:05.645
ADA: Find the game runner,
Keith. He's usually tailed

23:05.688 --> 23:06.994
by armed guards.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.653
Keith. Mike Jones.Welcome. I hear you're a shark.

23:13.696 --> 23:16.438
I vet all my players.
Can't be too careful,

23:16.482 --> 23:18.397
you know? Hmm.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.926
This is Mike Jones, everyone.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.714
What's up, Jones?

23:31.758 --> 23:33.542
ADA:
Don't screw this up

23:33.586 --> 23:36.458
before it even begins.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.591
I didn't want Fallon finding out
about this.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.593
Since I'm marrying into money,

23:40.636 --> 23:42.551
figured I'd make
my own millions.

23:42.595 --> 23:45.119
Wait, you two
are getting married?

23:47.513 --> 23:49.079
Well, respect.

23:49.123 --> 23:52.692
And here's to another black
man making the Forbes list.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.522
Mike Jones.

23:56.565 --> 23:59.394
ADA: Your melodrama is making me
very sleepy, Michael.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.744
Listen,
Keith keeps a coded ledger

24:01.788 --> 24:03.703
tracking how much
each game brings in,

24:03.746 --> 24:05.574
player debts
and his personal cut.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.142
I need photos of its contents.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.623
And you are gonna take them
for me.

24:30.643 --> 24:33.472
: Please, sir,
may I have some gazpacho?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.301
: Is this what you
normally eat when you come here?

24:37.345 --> 24:39.303
Yeah, it's a local delicacy.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.740
Guinea pig.Ew.

24:40.783 --> 24:44.047
Well, it tastes just like
guinea chicken to me.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.701
ANDERS: Guinea pigs,
I understand, are very

24:45.745 --> 24:47.355
environmentally friendly
to raise.

24:47.398 --> 24:48.878
Just like the squirrels that you
hunt and cook in your trailer,

24:48.922 --> 24:50.010
Alexis.FALLON: As much
as I would love

24:50.053 --> 24:52.142
to discuss rodents all night,

24:52.186 --> 24:53.666
I think we should celebrate.

24:53.709 --> 24:56.407
No one was injured
or backstabbed,

24:56.451 --> 24:58.540
so I consider today
a wild success.
SAM: No.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.194
I was injured.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.674
That dumb alpaca bit me.

25:01.717 --> 25:05.808
I want to thank you
for allowing us into your world.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.114
The people are warm.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.419
Countryside is lovely.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.465
It's actually really nice

25:10.509 --> 25:11.858
to share it with family.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.687
I need your help with something,
Anders. It's urgent.

25:14.730 --> 25:15.731
Fetch me some water.

25:15.775 --> 25:16.906
Sweep my tent for any bugs.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.386
ANDERS: Sir,
if you're going to continue

25:18.429 --> 25:20.649
to punish me, I insist that
we clear the air first.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.738
Is there a problem here?

25:22.782 --> 25:24.392
Or can we pretend neither of you

25:24.435 --> 25:26.699
slept with my mother
and get back to the meal?

25:26.742 --> 25:28.614
I'm going to bed.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.616
I think I'm gonna retire, too.

25:30.659 --> 25:33.532
If someone could just point me
in the direction of a hotel?

25:33.575 --> 25:35.316
Yeah, there's one
30 miles north of here.

25:35.359 --> 25:37.536
You can take an alpaca.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.363
Is there one without teeth?

25:39.407 --> 25:41.714
We're all staying in the
tents, just like Steven

25:41.757 --> 25:43.106
and the rest of
the volunteers

25:43.150 --> 25:45.718
so we can wake up tomorrow
together as a family.

25:45.761 --> 25:48.459
Come on, Mother.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.461
I will show you
to your lodgings.

25:50.505 --> 25:53.290
ALEXIS:
This is ridiculous.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.814
How is our suffering

25:54.857 --> 25:56.859
gonna convince Steven
to come back home?

25:56.903 --> 25:58.034
I thought that maybe...

25:59.645 --> 26:00.820
Don't let
the Chagas beetles bite.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.701
I got nothing.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.529
I'm out.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.058
Ugh.

26:22.102 --> 26:25.888
Was this tequila aged
in a barrel or a gasoline can?

26:25.932 --> 26:27.673
Dive bar swill.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.892
Uh, can you get me
another one, please?

26:29.936 --> 26:31.938
Mm-mm.
Oh.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.348
I will send those pics

26:51.392 --> 26:54.177
when I get out of here,
which is right now.

26:54.221 --> 26:57.354
You're not going anywhere.
Stay until the game is over,

26:57.398 --> 26:59.661
and alert me when it wraps.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.924
Hey, I was...

27:01.968 --> 27:03.186
looking for the bathroom.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.188
There's one right out there.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.668
I must've missed it.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.975
You know, I... meaning
to ask you about this jacket.

27:09.018 --> 27:11.020
This leather? It feels

27:11.064 --> 27:12.761
like lambskin,
but it could be calf...

27:12.805 --> 27:14.763
Hey!Oh, um...

27:14.807 --> 27:18.288
Sorry. So sorry.
So sorry. I will...

27:18.332 --> 27:19.638
Let's get back to the game.

27:19.681 --> 27:20.987
Got it.

27:23.206 --> 27:25.208
Keep your eye on him.

27:33.129 --> 27:36.655
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.574
FALLON:
Hey.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.315
Have you seen Mom?Oh, God.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.795
I hope she's not bothering
the breakfast crew.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.797
No, the volunteers love her.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.626
She's like a live-action
Miss Piggy.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.499
You have to admit, this hasn't
been a complete disaster.Not yet.

27:55.543 --> 27:58.285
I mean, you did get them to stay
through the night somehow.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.200
Hey, have you been in there?
It's crazy.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.078
STEVEN:
Oh, my God.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.821
Morning.

28:12.865 --> 28:16.738
Now, this is a humanitarian
relief effort I can get behind.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.740
This has Carrington

28:18.784 --> 28:20.611
written all over it.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.222
You guys already wasted
a tanker of fuel

28:22.265 --> 28:23.484
taking multiple private jets,

28:23.527 --> 28:24.659
and then...I told everyone we were here

28:24.703 --> 28:26.748
to work and live modestly.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.709
Yes. Deeper.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.102
Oh, deeper.

28:33.146 --> 28:34.756
FALLON:
Mom.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.367
Oh, Fallon, Steven.

28:37.411 --> 28:40.153
You both need to do this,
especially after

28:40.196 --> 28:42.590
spending that long, awful night
on the hard ground.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.593
Seriously? Is this a
joke to all of you

28:45.636 --> 28:47.160
You couldn't even last a day.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.771
Harder. Oh, yes.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.904
Thanks for the terrible night.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.080
The poker gods were
not smiling on me.

28:54.123 --> 28:57.126
Was that supposed to be code
for "the game is over"?

28:58.562 --> 29:00.739
Who's left?It's just Keith and his guards

29:00.782 --> 29:02.349
and two servers cleaning up.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.830
Good. It's Keith that I want.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.701
You should get going.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.051
You've got two minutes
to make your exit.

29:09.095 --> 29:12.054
Calmly,
without tipping off Keith.

29:12.098 --> 29:15.884
Looks like I'm out.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.669
Well, welcome back any time.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.803
Especially if you keep losing.

29:23.370 --> 29:24.719
It's all about you.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.766
Hey, uh, Jeff. I was
getting ready to head out.

29:27.809 --> 29:28.941
Maybe you should,
too. You know,

29:28.984 --> 29:30.116
looks like they're
trying to clean up.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.813
Think I'm gonna hang out
for a little bit.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.684
Why don't you fix me
another drink, huh?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.687
Ticktock, Culhane.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.994
You've got 60 seconds.

29:39.038 --> 29:42.650
Hey, baby, how about
you fix me another drink?

29:42.693 --> 29:44.739
You know, don't waste any
more time on this poser here.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.786
Uh, why don't you watch
your mouth, Mike Jones?

29:47.829 --> 29:50.310
Don't you have someone
to go home to

29:50.353 --> 29:51.746
So why don't you and I...

29:51.790 --> 29:54.053
You are making a grave error
in judgment, my friend.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.750
ADA:
What are you doing, Michael?

29:55.794 --> 29:58.579
If you put your hand on me
one more time,

29:58.622 --> 30:00.102
I will put my fist
through your soul.

30:00.146 --> 30:02.496
Man, I whupped
your little moody ass once,

30:02.539 --> 30:04.759
and I will do it again.ADA:
Get out of there!

30:04.803 --> 30:06.369
Now!

30:06.413 --> 30:09.459
Hey, hey! Not in my place.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.418
These guys are cut off.
Get them out of here.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.376
It's cool. No worries.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.857
Out. Get out. Go home.It's cool. It's cool.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.946
Man, what the hell
is wrong with you?We got to go.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.731
Oh, we're gonna do this
right here? Cool.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.823
FBI!

30:24.866 --> 30:26.737
Move, move, move!

30:30.829 --> 30:32.265
This is exactly why I left.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.919
And it's why I didn't want
any of you here.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.138
Well, I don't even know
who would do this.Steven Carrington?

30:36.182 --> 30:39.620
I need you
to sign here, please,

30:39.663 --> 30:41.187
for the tent and for all
the services we arranged.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.929
No, I'm not paying
for their order.

30:43.972 --> 30:46.888
This is your order.
Your family assistant called

30:46.932 --> 30:49.543
and made an order
on behalf of Steven Carrington.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.414
Your credit card was used
to guarantee everything.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.938
And I have a special delivery

30:52.981 --> 30:54.896
for Alexis Carrington?

30:54.940 --> 30:55.941
Hmm?

30:55.984 --> 30:57.638
Oh!

30:57.681 --> 30:59.509
How generous.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.381
Is this a thank-you
for volunteering?

31:01.424 --> 31:04.079
Oh, my God. You stole
his credit card.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.820
What the hell
is wrong with you?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.169
Oh, dear.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.823
You think Iordered this?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.912
Just like when you you ran up my
credit line after the divorce.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.218
Don't try to deny it.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.915
I saw the desperation
in your eyes

31:13.959 --> 31:15.177
when you didn't get a
bigger insurance check.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.484
Oh, good.
So you can pay for this.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.051
I don't have
the insurance money anymore.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.923
I had expenses.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.534
I mean, clearly there's
been some misunderstanding.What?

31:24.578 --> 31:25.927
I will call
the credit card company.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.798
Don't bother. You're
not talking your way

31:27.842 --> 31:28.843
out of this one.Oh!

31:28.887 --> 31:30.758
ALEXIS:
What are you doing?

31:30.801 --> 31:32.716
STEVEN:
You act like you care,

31:32.760 --> 31:33.892
but all you do is use us.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.284
You used me
from the day I was born

31:35.328 --> 31:36.938
when you lied
about who my father was.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.853
It was just so that
you could keep enjoying

31:38.897 --> 31:39.810
the perks of being a Carrington.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.900
No, Steven, that's not true.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.249
I did it
for you.
Oh.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.467
I love you.

31:44.511 --> 31:45.860
ANDERS:
Well, at least

31:45.904 --> 31:47.688
it puts everything else
in perspective...

31:47.731 --> 31:49.342
Save your dollar-store advice,
Anders.

31:49.385 --> 31:50.560
No wants
to hear what you think.

31:50.604 --> 31:51.779
I made a big mistake!

31:51.822 --> 31:54.347
Oh, ho.
My silence was
my sacrifice.

31:54.390 --> 31:57.002
I saw how your life was
falling apart and how Steven,

31:57.045 --> 31:58.351
the baby, was

31:58.394 --> 31:59.439
the glue holding it together.

31:59.482 --> 32:00.570
I don't want to discuss this.

32:00.614 --> 32:01.963
We'll never get
past it if we don't

32:02.007 --> 32:03.051
talk about it!

32:03.095 --> 32:04.661
Oh, that's it!

32:04.705 --> 32:07.186
Back to work.
Everyone outside, now!

32:08.970 --> 32:12.452
FALLON:
I am the one trying to keep
the peace among these jackals.

32:12.495 --> 32:14.106
So, suddenly, you're
the peacekeeper?

32:14.149 --> 32:15.934
Whenever you've needed me, I've
dropped everything for you.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.284
Just like last year when
you called me back from Haiti

32:18.327 --> 32:19.894
because you didn't
want to face Dad alone.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.809
Or when you made me sleep
on the floor of your room

32:21.852 --> 32:23.463
for six months after Mom left.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.073
Well, that's why
I'm here for you now!

32:25.117 --> 32:28.598
You're here for you,Fallon!

32:32.515 --> 32:35.605
Everyone, get on board.
Dad, Anders,

32:35.649 --> 32:37.912
50 feet apart
at all times. Sam,

32:37.956 --> 32:39.261
no more breaks, and Mother...

32:39.305 --> 32:41.872
No, no, no, no, no.
Mother, I see you trying

32:41.916 --> 32:43.352
to break for the tent!

32:44.832 --> 32:45.920
Oh.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.271
I am going to finish

32:49.315 --> 32:51.621
building this house
if it kills me.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.945

silly.

35:13.285 --> 35:16.940
I made a call to a friend
in a very high place,

35:16.984 --> 35:19.334
and kind of took you
out of the running.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.031

Oh. Thank you.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.088
Hello?

35:34.132 --> 35:36.917
Was Paraguay the family vacation
you'd hoped for?

35:36.960 --> 35:37.874
What do you want, Kirby?

35:37.918 --> 35:39.354
Well, I didn't see any photos.

35:39.398 --> 35:42.183
You know, people love to share
every minor details

35:42.227 --> 35:44.446
of their travels these days.
"Look at me!"

35:44.490 --> 35:47.667
"Look at my new bag!"
"I'm rich!" It's sick.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.059
You little bitch.

35:49.103 --> 35:50.844
You're the one
that set me up.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.673
Do you have any idea of
the destruction that you caused?

35:53.716 --> 35:55.892
No, but I was hoping.

35:55.936 --> 35:59.287
This sounds like a challenge,
and I adore a challenge.

35:59.331 --> 36:01.985
I got rid of you once before,
and I'll do it again.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.552
FALLON:
It was a disaster,

36:03.596 --> 36:06.381
and then we built a house, and
then it was a disaster again.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.600
There. You're all caught up.

36:07.643 --> 36:09.950
Well,
I'm sorry I missed it.

36:09.993 --> 36:11.125
Mmm.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.521
Well, it turns out I
could have been there.

36:15.564 --> 36:16.739
I didn't get the job.

36:16.783 --> 36:18.785
What? No!

36:18.828 --> 36:20.308
I'm sorry.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.744
I can make some calls.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.398
I'll have meetings
set up by tomorrow.

36:23.442 --> 36:25.226
Oh, no, no, no,
that's okay.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.141
I don't want to force it.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.927
I got to accept some things
are just out of my control.

36:33.016 --> 36:37.151
I heard about everything
that happened, your son.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.805
Mm.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.589
I'm so sorry, Blake.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.157
You're strong.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.290
Strong people have
a hard time

36:45.333 --> 36:47.335
accepting help
when it's offered.

36:47.379 --> 36:48.945
Celia was like that?

36:48.989 --> 36:50.817
Yeah, she could be stubborn.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.949
It's part of why we were
attracted to each other.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.604
If it wasn't for you,
I never would have met her,

36:55.648 --> 36:57.432
and then I never
would have met you.

36:57.476 --> 37:02.568
I... feel fate
brought me back here.

37:02.611 --> 37:05.048
Yeah, maybe the first time,

37:05.092 --> 37:08.965
but I'm not convinced it was
fate that brought you back.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.710
Did you call Cristal?

37:16.756 --> 37:19.280
Sir, please.
I'm just trying to help.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.108
Oh, did...?

37:21.151 --> 37:22.327
:
Did you think...?

37:22.370 --> 37:24.154
I was just polishing
the guns, trying to take

37:24.198 --> 37:26.287
a few things off your plate.

37:26.331 --> 37:29.856
I know you care about
me, about all of us,

37:29.899 --> 37:32.554
and that your intentions were
good, in the past and now.

37:32.598 --> 37:35.165
Not like I was
a saint back then.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.298
I did my fair
share of cheating.

37:37.342 --> 37:41.781
It was a difficult time, and
I'm pleased we had this talk.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.087
But I'm all packed,
ready to hit the road.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.525
You're not going anywhere.

37:46.568 --> 37:49.354
And we have a son together now.

37:49.397 --> 37:52.095
I think we make a
pretty good team.

37:52.139 --> 37:53.575
Names aren't what make a family.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.926

Yeah, sure. Whatever.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.397
Anders was right.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.487

was that you are the glue

38:35.530 --> 38:37.315
that holds everyone
in this family together.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.273

this family should stick

38:39.317 --> 38:42.102
to building dynasties,
not houses.

38:42.145 --> 38:46.019
Not you. You could do anything.

38:46.062 --> 38:49.065
And instead, you do everything
for everyone else.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.242
And you can't do it anymore.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.375

38:58.118 --> 39:00.120
You need to go.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.384
I don't want you to,

39:03.428 --> 39:05.821
but you know
it's what you have to do.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.260
Okay, please, can you say
something before I take it back?

39:10.304 --> 39:12.567
Thank you, Fallon.

39:12.611 --> 39:15.178
You are the strongest
person I know.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.617
You don't need anyone,
certainly not me.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.620
I hope you know that.

39:21.663 --> 39:24.100
While you're in
a generous mood,

39:24.144 --> 39:27.016
there's something else
I need you to do.
What?

39:27.060 --> 39:28.191
Reconcile with Mom.

39:28.235 --> 39:31.020
No, no. I'd rather
build an entire village.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.022
I know. Please.

39:33.066 --> 39:35.373
For me.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.288
Okay, sure.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.247
Fine, I'll do it.
On one condition.

39:40.290 --> 39:43.772
What?Finish the song.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.208
Well, fine.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.601

No, I can't.

No, I know.
