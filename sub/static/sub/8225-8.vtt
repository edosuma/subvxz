00:00.061 --> 00:03.811
Please do not try what you are about to see at home.

00:03.812 --> 00:05.369
We're what you call experts.

00:05.370 --> 00:06.450
Can't you tell?

00:08.164 --> 00:10.562
On this episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:10.563 --> 00:13.542
Cars, guns, what can go wrong.

00:13.543 --> 00:16.129
Adam and Jamie are on "Burn Notice",

00:16.472 --> 00:17.493
testing the myth

00:17.494 --> 00:19.482
that gives the bad guy the slip.

00:19.483 --> 00:21.024
Close, but no cigar.

00:21.119 --> 00:22.876
You can bounce a bullet

00:23.526 --> 00:25.386
Awesome, I told you you can call that.

00:25.387 --> 00:27.137
through the bottom of their car.

00:27.379 --> 00:28.437
Firing.

00:28.709 --> 00:30.183
That was a perfect shot.

00:31.295 --> 00:33.663
Meanwhile, Kari and Tory and Grant

00:36.507 --> 00:38.908
take on some action hero heroes.

00:38.909 --> 00:40.482
Somebody want the explosion.

00:40.483 --> 00:42.826
Finding out if the force of shock wave,

00:42.827 --> 00:44.272
He flies into the air

00:44.273 --> 00:45.856
without a care of the world.

00:46.192 --> 00:48.675
could push the power of ordinary jumpers

00:49.737 --> 00:51.980
into a super human leap.

00:53.274 --> 00:55.076
I can't tell you what happened.

00:59.382 --> 01:01.420
Who are the mythbusters?

01:02.159 --> 01:03.259
Adam Savage..

01:03.260 --> 01:05.138
70% chance of science.

01:05.138 --> 01:06.701
And Jamie Hyneman.

01:06.702 --> 01:08.668
Is that hot enough for you?

01:09.038 --> 01:13.516
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.

01:13.614 --> 01:15.528
Together with Tory Belleci,

01:15.529 --> 01:17.101
That was insane.

01:17.109 --> 01:18.413
Grant Imahara,

01:19.239 --> 01:20.603
and Kari Byron.

01:20.783 --> 01:21.811
Let's do it.

01:22.418 --> 01:24.344
They don't tell the myths.

01:25.099 --> 01:27.594
They put them to the test.

01:39.648 --> 01:40.893
Jamie, in your travels,

01:40.894 --> 01:43.058
have you ever found yourself in a situation

01:43.059 --> 01:45.771
where you're being chased by someone and you're shooting at them

01:45.772 --> 01:47.176
to try to stop them from chasing you?

01:47.736 --> 01:49.148
I don't want to talk about it.

01:54.428 --> 01:57.988
In the show, our hero is being chased in the car by another car.

01:57.989 --> 02:00.340
And he says, if you don't have armor piercing,

02:00.341 --> 02:01.707
you can forget about shooting through

02:01.708 --> 02:04.245
the engine or the radiator of your pursuer,

02:04.352 --> 02:08.047
but it says you can skip bullets off the ground,

02:08.048 --> 02:11.043
into the floor of the car that's chasing you.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.605
I'm not so sure about that.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.759
And that is exactly why I think it is something we should test.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.033
To delay a pursuer,

02:19.050 --> 02:20.742
but leave them unharmed,

02:20.743 --> 02:23.323
the tactic is literally under fire.

02:23.324 --> 02:25.947
Ricochet bullets off the ground and up through the undercarriage.

02:25.948 --> 02:28.567
But can you really bounce a bullet

02:28.568 --> 02:30.065
up into the underside of a car,

02:30.066 --> 02:32.463
or is this myth on the rebound?

02:33.715 --> 02:35.522
So what kind of gun were they using in that clip,

02:35.523 --> 02:36.183
do we know?

02:36.184 --> 02:38.727
It looks to be a 9 millimeter semi-auto.

02:38.728 --> 02:40.810
Seems to me first thing we ought to do is to see

02:40.811 --> 02:43.448
whether that kind of gun would penetrate the bottom of a car.

02:43.449 --> 02:44.044
Excellent.

02:44.045 --> 02:45.562
Let's get out to the shooting range,

02:45.563 --> 02:47.079
and shoot the bottom of a car.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.273
Why not?

02:50.335 --> 02:52.512
So with Yolo County bomb range,

02:52.512 --> 02:56.004
the "Mythbusters" prepared to take on this myth point blank.

02:58.016 --> 03:00.844
I love the anticipation of shooting at cars.

03:01.894 --> 03:04.257
Cars, guns, what can go wrong?

03:04.824 --> 03:06.177
These are our cars.

03:06.178 --> 03:09.628
Blue car, good guy; red car, bad guy.

03:09.629 --> 03:12.262
This is the orientation they're in in the clip,

03:12.263 --> 03:14.790
Slightly offset, and 15 feet apart.

03:14.906 --> 03:15.606
Now in the clip,

03:15.607 --> 03:18.410
the guy says without a high powered ram,

03:18.411 --> 03:21.697
you're not getting past the radiator or the fire wall.

03:22.038 --> 03:25.960
Yep, supposedly, the underside of the car is a better target.

03:25.961 --> 03:27.758
So first, they'll test that.

03:27.759 --> 03:28.797
We lift the car up

03:28.797 --> 03:32.485
and shoot at point blank range into the floor of the car,

03:32.486 --> 03:33.662
see if the bullets make it through.

03:33.663 --> 03:36.030
I know they're supposed to have skipped off the ground,

03:36.031 --> 03:38.156
but a direct bullet won't make it through the floor,

03:38.217 --> 03:39.594
then a skipped bullet never would.

03:40.051 --> 03:43.342
And to find out if those point blank rounds penetrate,

03:44.823 --> 03:47.663
They are very expensive balloons, clearly.

03:47.999 --> 03:50.576
Adam fills the bottom of the car with balloons,

03:50.577 --> 03:53.895
and then gives the underside of the car a whitewash.

03:54.879 --> 03:55.941
Oh, yeah!

03:56.537 --> 03:59.263
Yeah, that's the clean experimental space.

03:59.457 --> 04:01.096
And the whiteout makes it clear

04:01.097 --> 04:04.247
that this bounce round is quite the trick shot.

04:04.757 --> 04:08.921
I am looking at the whole wad of stuff I have to get past

04:08.922 --> 04:10.042
to get into the cab.

04:10.112 --> 04:14.644
Really, the only hope that I have is a spot right about there

04:14.645 --> 04:17.511
which may trim the guy's toe nails or something,

04:17.512 --> 04:18.930
but that's my only hope.

04:19.189 --> 04:22.309
Shooting the underside of the car when Jamie is ready.

04:24.161 --> 04:26.127
That looked like an almost perfect hit.

04:26.230 --> 04:30.761
Jamie shot sends bullets right into the sweet spot.

04:33.154 --> 04:35.437
And although the rounds are hitting the mark,

04:35.438 --> 04:37.344
have they made it through the wheel well?

04:38.648 --> 04:39.857
I see a hit here.

04:39.858 --> 04:42.009
I have gone through the floorboard here,

04:42.014 --> 04:44.259
but not through the carpet it looks like.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.390
Underneath the car,

04:45.391 --> 04:47.706
it looks like most bullets were deflected.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.406
Wait.

04:49.544 --> 04:51.205
There's a popped balloon in here.

04:51.542 --> 04:55.714
But one burst balloon reveals one bullet did make it through.

04:56.641 --> 04:57.529
What does that look like?

04:57.530 --> 04:58.215
That's a bullet.

04:58.416 --> 05:02.130
And it made it through the floor and into the cabin of the car.

05:02.131 --> 05:03.910
If it made it inthrough the floor,

05:03.911 --> 05:05.487
it could make it into the guy's foot.

05:05.488 --> 05:06.803
Nice shooting test.

05:08.068 --> 05:11.057
So it was able to get bullets to penetrate the cab of the car

05:11.058 --> 05:12.823
with this nine millimeter pistol.

05:12.824 --> 05:13.868
And it went in here,

05:13.869 --> 05:16.828
a couple down there, one over there.

05:16.933 --> 05:19.156
But keep in mind this was a direct hit

05:19.157 --> 05:21.578
under optimal static conditions.

05:21.851 --> 05:24.964
That means it is now time to find out whether or not

05:24.965 --> 05:28.479
a ricocheted bullet keeps enough energy

05:28.480 --> 05:30.481
to still pierce the cab of our car.

05:30.482 --> 05:32.085
Well, round one is over.

05:32.086 --> 05:33.592
Time for ricochet.

05:38.203 --> 05:41.674
Next, the "Mythbusters" get the jump on Hollywood.

05:45.370 --> 05:46.765
What are you looking so excited about?

05:46.766 --> 05:49.400
We are testing a Hollywood movie myth,

05:49.401 --> 05:50.905
dealing with the explosions.

05:50.997 --> 05:52.085
Great. What is it?

05:52.094 --> 05:54.383
This comes from a classic action movie

05:54.384 --> 05:56.322
where the hero is running for an explosive.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.595
And just before it detonates, he jumps with all his might.

05:58.596 --> 06:00.868
All you probably know what happens.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.944
I know just as he's in the mid air, the blast goes off

06:03.945 --> 06:06.029
and a resulting shock wave actually pushes him

06:06.030 --> 06:07.707
through the air giving him a super human jump.

06:07.708 --> 06:09.051
Exactly. But is that true?

06:09.052 --> 06:11.199
Can a shock wave from explosion actually

06:11.200 --> 06:13.433
push you further than you can jump on your own?

06:13.434 --> 06:14.802
Cool.

06:14.996 --> 06:18.101
It is a bombastic scene straight from the blockbusters,

06:18.102 --> 06:20.122
escaping an imminent explosion,

06:20.123 --> 06:21.974
the hero leaps into the air,

06:22.391 --> 06:26.277
and the force of the flash gives him a super human boost.

06:26.278 --> 06:28.820
But are those film make physics bang on

06:28.821 --> 06:31.642
or is this a mission implausible?

06:31.643 --> 06:33.898
All right, obviously, we gonna need human standard

06:33.899 --> 06:35.340
I'm not exactlly comfortable with any of us

06:35.341 --> 06:36.942
get exposed to a shock wave.

06:36.943 --> 06:38.586
Sounds like a job for busters,

06:38.605 --> 06:39.797
I think the first order of our business

06:39.798 --> 06:41.347
is to rig him so he can jump.

06:41.348 --> 06:43.772
Why don't you figure out a way to get him to jump.

06:43.773 --> 06:44.929
While you working on that,

06:44.930 --> 06:47.039
you and I can find out how far he should jump.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.257
So hit the track for a little data collection,

06:49.258 --> 06:52.332
maybe check out for some jump distances, hang times.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.755
Exactlly little jump and fact-finding missions.

06:55.061 --> 06:56.990
So to jump start the myth,

06:56.991 --> 06:59.808
Kari and Tory need to find out the average distance

06:59.809 --> 07:02.386
and hang time of a regular long jumper.

07:02.387 --> 07:04.125
Feeling stronger!

07:04.241 --> 07:05.179
Ready to jump?

07:05.180 --> 07:06.243
Absolutely.

07:06.835 --> 07:08.936
We have come to the track at the college of San Mateo

07:09.072 --> 07:11.131
to test the myth that the shock wave

07:11.132 --> 07:13.190
from a bomb can actually extend your jump.

07:13.455 --> 07:16.502
There's no way we're going to be jumping anywhere near an explosion.

07:16.503 --> 07:17.558
But Buster needs to do it.

07:17.559 --> 07:20.768
We need to get a benchmark that how far he needs to jump.

07:20.769 --> 07:25.357
So we are here to get expert training from a champion longjumper, Joy.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.838
She's good, really good.

07:27.839 --> 07:29.461
All right, let's see how she's doing.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.272
Joy demonstrates exactly how it's done.

07:33.394 --> 07:35.651
And she makes it look easy.

07:37.563 --> 07:39.831
Then it is over to the first contender.

07:40.033 --> 07:42.298
Kari, this is your long jump.

07:42.299 --> 07:43.495
You get three attempts,

07:43.496 --> 07:45.052
then we'll average all three.

07:45.053 --> 07:45.810
Are you ready?

07:45.811 --> 07:47.542
Yes. Here we go.

07:49.130 --> 07:51.214
All right. Get those legs up.

07:51.215 --> 07:54.544
Kari gets a runup and then leaps for all her weight.

07:56.034 --> 07:56.600
Oh, my god.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.913
I think we have just seen a new world record.

07:58.935 --> 08:01.681
I think I got nine feet with my new technique.

08:02.972 --> 08:04.902
That looked painful.

08:04.903 --> 08:05.685
Painful?

08:05.686 --> 08:06.428
I mean graceful.

08:06.429 --> 08:07.358
Graceful?

08:07.646 --> 08:09.197
Well, with two more jumps,

08:09.198 --> 08:12.436
Kari's form improved and so does her distance.

08:12.437 --> 08:14.089
Kari, you went ten feet.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.188
You increased your distance.

08:15.189 --> 08:16.328
All right!

08:16.969 --> 08:18.837
Kari has just finished all three jumps,

08:18.838 --> 08:22.074
and she came away with 9.5 feet average.

08:22.075 --> 08:23.310
That's incredible,

08:23.311 --> 08:25.270
considering the fact she is not that athletic,

08:25.271 --> 08:28.014
she is very uncoordinated and she has a bum knee.

08:29.949 --> 08:31.016
It's my turn next.

08:31.017 --> 08:32.772
It is not a competition, Tory,

08:32.773 --> 08:34.328
it is about data collection,

08:34.328 --> 08:37.467
and setting the average Joe leaping benchmark.

08:37.469 --> 08:38.900
Time to get in the zone.

08:39.802 --> 08:41.014
Is he putting on a headband?

08:41.015 --> 08:42.102
Yes, he is.

08:42.648 --> 08:44.232
All right. I'm in the zone.

08:46.051 --> 08:47.689
Well, he takes a runup

08:49.479 --> 08:51.984
and he really goes the distance.

08:53.119 --> 08:55.081
I got sand in my pants.

08:55.082 --> 08:56.935
That was about 16 feet?

08:56.936 --> 08:57.841
Remind you of Michael Jordan,

08:57.842 --> 08:58.797
all that air?

08:59.057 --> 09:00.280
Two more jumps.

09:02.641 --> 09:05.182
And data on distance is in.

09:05.276 --> 09:06.730
All right, your average is 16 feet.

09:06.731 --> 09:07.766
Mine is 9.5.

09:07.767 --> 09:08.686
Good job, you guys.

09:08.687 --> 09:10.653
Why don't we look the high speed

09:10.654 --> 09:12.620
and see how much hang time we're actually getting.

09:13.007 --> 09:15.704
Yeah, just as important as the average distance

09:15.705 --> 09:18.246
is the average hang time of the jumps.

09:18.379 --> 09:21.379
Look, you got in the air, got some height there.

09:21.931 --> 09:23.171
That's form.

09:23.299 --> 09:25.430
But the hang time isn't looking good.

09:25.431 --> 09:29.056
Even with Tory airborne for five-tenths a second,

09:29.057 --> 09:32.562
getting the timing right in full scale is gonna be tough.

09:32.612 --> 09:34.347
Yeah, we did come out here to find out

09:34.348 --> 09:38.079
what the average long jump would be from an average person.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.938
Between Tory and I, our average is 12 feet.

09:40.939 --> 09:42.353
When you look at that on high speed,

09:42.354 --> 09:44.698
that's not even a half second of hang time.

09:44.699 --> 09:46.593
That's a very small window

09:46.594 --> 09:48.487
to actually trigger everything that needs to happen,

09:48.488 --> 09:50.080
the jump and the bomb.

09:50.394 --> 09:51.946
So I think we might have to go with something

09:51.947 --> 09:53.008
that gives more hang time.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.338
Maybe an Olympic world record or something like that,

09:56.339 --> 09:58.074
or something like, I don't know,

09:58.075 --> 10:00.392
double the hang time of what we can get.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.046
Doubling the hang time is crucial.

10:03.047 --> 10:04.706
After all, in this myth,

10:04.707 --> 10:06.802
the hero is leaping for their life,

10:06.803 --> 10:10.145
making this an extraordinary jump.

10:11.114 --> 10:12.502
It's going to be soar tomorrow.

10:12.503 --> 10:13.421
Coming up.

10:13.422 --> 10:15.534
Ready for the naked avenger.

10:18.557 --> 10:19.626
And later...

10:19.627 --> 10:22.886
We are literally on the highway to the danger zone.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.684
It's a big bounce from the small screen.

10:34.685 --> 10:35.617
For sheer panic,

10:35.618 --> 10:38.163
it's hard to beat bullets coming up from the floorboard.

10:38.164 --> 10:41.902
But can a bullet on the rebound really shoot through?

10:41.921 --> 10:44.804
Having successfully pierced the postage stamp

10:44.805 --> 10:47.025
side target wheel well of the chasing car,

10:47.026 --> 10:49.690
it's now time to find out if we can get underneath there

10:49.691 --> 10:51.123
with a ricocheted bullet.

10:51.124 --> 10:54.816
So we come out here to this runway and lovely Tracy California.

10:54.817 --> 10:56.882
We're going to start to fire some bullets into the ground

10:56.883 --> 10:59.082
and see what kind of predictable behavior

10:59.082 --> 11:02.345
we can expect from those bullets after they bounce.

11:02.346 --> 11:05.736
So using the cars to map out the trajectory of the clip,

11:05.817 --> 11:08.684
Adam sets up a remote rig for the fire power,

11:08.716 --> 11:11.377
and gets an angle on the angle of the gun.

11:11.378 --> 11:12.489
Pretty good.

11:12.778 --> 11:15.257
So at what angle do we begin shooting into the ground.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.684
The first shot is gonna to be, what I'm gonna call the intuition angle.

11:18.685 --> 11:19.996
If I was this guy,

11:20.045 --> 11:23.900
this is the angle which I feel like I would have to hit the ground

11:23.900 --> 11:26.845
in order to bounce correctly into the wheel well of my assailant.

11:26.846 --> 11:29.693
Turns out, it's about 16.5 degrees. Am I right?

11:29.694 --> 11:30.870
I have no idea.

11:30.871 --> 11:32.819
But it's as good place as any to begin.

11:32.820 --> 11:35.909
It is the natural place to start their rebound analysis.

11:35.910 --> 11:39.571
So Adam sets up a backboard to track the angle of the ricochet.

11:39.572 --> 11:41.826
All right, for the first intuition shot,

11:41.827 --> 11:44.826
I'm gonna load this copper jacketed cartridge into the gun

11:44.827 --> 11:46.251
and we're going to fire.

11:47.084 --> 11:51.567
The gun is hot, and in 3, 2, 1.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.736
That was a perfect shot.

11:56.099 --> 11:59.333
A perfect shot and a perfect bounce.

11:59.334 --> 12:02.354
The bullet hit perfectly in the center of our bullet box.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.594
That's great.

12:03.671 --> 12:06.038
And based on the bullet hole in the back board,

12:06.039 --> 12:07.478
Adam can get the angle.

12:07.729 --> 12:11.375
Bullet was aimed at the ground at a 16.2 degree angle,

12:11.376 --> 12:15.932
after it hit the ground, it left at 9.95 degree angle.

12:15.933 --> 12:19.364
A little bit more than half of the angle.

12:19.689 --> 12:21.679
A little bit more than half.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.402
But the question is,

12:23.403 --> 12:26.936
did the bullet lose power after its rebound from the ground?

12:27.359 --> 12:30.525
One plus one equals two.

12:31.221 --> 12:34.269
Bullet hits the ground at 1200 plus feet per second.

12:34.270 --> 12:38.064
It left the ground at 962 feet per second.

12:38.065 --> 12:41.160
That's a lot of energy still in that piece of metal.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.647
Yeah, it's not a lot of loss.

12:42.648 --> 12:44.412
Well, let's try a steeper angle.

12:44.413 --> 12:47.738
Yep. It's gonna take a few more tilts at bouncing bullets

12:47.739 --> 12:51.810
before the "Mythbusters" have the ins and outs of ricochet dynamics.

12:51.993 --> 12:54.910
Test number two at 32 degrees.

12:55.073 --> 12:58.678
Gun is hot, and 3, 2, 1.

13:03.342 --> 13:04.532
Very interesting.

13:04.831 --> 13:07.235
Shot right exactly where I wanted it to.

13:11.239 --> 13:12.810
That's unexpected.

13:13.094 --> 13:15.374
The ricocheted angle is pretty much exactly

13:15.375 --> 13:17.020
the angle that it hit the ground at,

13:17.021 --> 13:17.997
like a mirror.

13:17.997 --> 13:21.301
Hit it 32 degrees, and bounced at 32 degrees.

13:21.302 --> 13:23.500
I would not have called that.

13:23.940 --> 13:25.546
That is weird.

13:25.776 --> 13:28.443
Weird, and it is plain that sharper angle

13:28.443 --> 13:31.443
has had another important impact on the bullet.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.739
Entry speed the same as its predecessor,

13:33.740 --> 13:36.611
exit speed 475 feet per second.

13:36.612 --> 13:40.172
Lost almost two-thirds of its energy

13:40.383 --> 13:42.017
hitting the ground at that angle.

13:42.018 --> 13:45.132
That puts it down, I think, around 300 miles an hour,

13:45.133 --> 13:46.928
which you wouldn't want to get hit by,

13:46.929 --> 13:49.803
but I don't know whether that will penetrate steel or not.

13:49.804 --> 13:51.489
Yeah, it's a lot of lost energy.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.813
At this point one thing is perfectly clear.

13:55.103 --> 13:57.239
The skipper the bullet hits the ground at,

13:57.240 --> 14:00.120
more energy it's gonna lose in that transaction.

14:00.146 --> 14:02.222
Now we need to find a buttom zone

14:02.223 --> 14:06.126
where the angle is not so steep that it loses all of its energy,

14:06.223 --> 14:08.327
but it is steep enough to get

14:08.328 --> 14:10.477
where it needs to go underneath the car.

14:10.478 --> 14:13.656
And to round out the angle of their automatic tango,

14:13.657 --> 14:14.767
The gun is hot.

14:14.768 --> 14:17.349
they're trying a much shallower 8 degrees.

14:17.350 --> 14:18.797
3, 2, 1.

14:21.586 --> 14:23.884
Hit a little bit forward of where I expected.

14:25.027 --> 14:27.398
Bullet hit the asphalt 8 degrees,

14:27.654 --> 14:31.245
and ricocheted off it at 5.1 degrees.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.571
Some data there.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.555
This times angle was less acute,

14:34.556 --> 14:37.269
but interestingly, the bullet hit the board traveling at

14:37.270 --> 14:39.622
1130 feet per second,

14:39.623 --> 14:41.395
the fastest speed yet.

14:41.689 --> 14:43.824
What does that mean for bouncing bullets?

14:43.825 --> 14:44.602
One.

14:46.056 --> 14:47.552
Behind me I got two cars,

14:47.553 --> 14:49.903
a gun position and three shots in the ground,

14:49.904 --> 14:53.020
and a bunch of bullet angles to work out.

14:53.021 --> 14:55.787
Now I could have the editors to do it graphically for me.

14:55.788 --> 14:59.119
Hold on, hold on, that only helps you to understand what's going on.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.261
I want to understand what's going on here and now.

15:01.262 --> 15:05.239
So, I am going to draw those angles in a brightly colored string.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.665
Like something out of CSI,

15:07.666 --> 15:11.449
our pink plotyy spider is tracking all the angles of the bullets

15:11.450 --> 15:13.858
to work out where they should hit the car.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.214
And it is clear from the outset that

15:16.215 --> 15:18.475
one angle is not going to work.

15:18.528 --> 15:19.619
I think right off the bat,

15:19.620 --> 15:21.812
this extreme angle and amount of power it lose,

15:21.813 --> 15:23.792
we should chuck the 32 degree angle.

15:23.793 --> 15:24.427
I agree.

15:24.428 --> 15:26.662
All right, keep going.

15:26.761 --> 15:29.701
But the 16 degree angle hits the target.

15:30.209 --> 15:31.900
Jamie, that looks really good.

15:31.901 --> 15:33.920
I've got to say, coming into this,

15:33.921 --> 15:36.113
I didn't think we could be able to get a steep enough angle

15:36.114 --> 15:37.476
to get up and into the car,

15:37.477 --> 15:40.245
but looks like I was wrong.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.559
Their angle of aim is determined.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.602
But there's still one more test for the bouncing bullet.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.675
This right here, is actually cut from

15:47.675 --> 15:50.127
the wheel well of the car that's chasing us.

15:50.128 --> 15:52.361
We're going to ricochet a bullet into it,

15:52.362 --> 15:56.001
see if 75% of its original energy is enough

15:56.002 --> 16:00.284
to pierce the steel plate and all the padding behind it.

16:01.118 --> 16:03.338
Ricochet shot into fire wall.

16:04.177 --> 16:05.318
I'm excited about this round .

16:05.319 --> 16:08.476
3, 2, 1. Fire.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.032
Perfect hit.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.423
Firing at 16 degrees,

16:13.424 --> 16:16.522
the bullet bounced and hit the board at 10 degrees,

16:16.523 --> 16:18.978
But did it have the power to penetrate?

16:18.979 --> 16:20.726
Oh, it went through.

16:20.727 --> 16:21.660
Oh, yeah.

16:21.661 --> 16:23.097
Dude, look at that.

16:23.098 --> 16:26.510
Even the ricocheted shot went through all the padding

16:26.511 --> 16:28.472
and hit shielding and the fire wall.

16:28.473 --> 16:29.485
That would hurt.

16:29.486 --> 16:30.762
That's awesome.

16:30.763 --> 16:32.086
I totally can call that.

16:32.087 --> 16:36.251
Yep. The 16 degree bullet not only bounced in the right trajectory,

16:36.252 --> 16:39.217
but it also retained enough power to penetrate.

16:39.218 --> 16:42.031
It is time for this myth to hit the road.

16:43.180 --> 16:45.842
Later, the surf is up for buster.

16:45.843 --> 16:48.293
Good luck, Buddy, think action hero.

16:48.294 --> 16:50.911
But can he catch a shock wave?

16:52.073 --> 16:54.638
That was a healthy shock wave.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.428
In this explosive surf-up myth,

17:03.429 --> 17:05.740
the hero leaps at the last second

17:05.741 --> 17:08.492
and supposedly by catching that shock wave

17:08.493 --> 17:11.608
his jump is end up to the super human.

17:12.221 --> 17:14.398
After athletics 101,

17:14.398 --> 17:15.633
How do you do it?

17:15.634 --> 17:18.656
It seems the hang time duration of an ordinary jump

17:18.657 --> 17:20.915
is not long enough for a blast.

17:20.982 --> 17:24.019
So they're turning to the extraordinary.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.012
Now for this test,

17:25.012 --> 17:27.353
we're going for world record territory.

17:28.483 --> 17:31.823
The long jump that's approximately 25 feet for women

17:31.824 --> 17:33.325
and 29 feet for men,

17:33.326 --> 17:35.486
that should give us about a second of hang time.

17:35.899 --> 17:39.405
That makes it a little bit easier for Buster to still be in mid air

17:39.406 --> 17:42.123
after we launch him for us to set off the bomb.

17:42.124 --> 17:46.311
That means we have a benchmark for at least 25 feet for Buster.

17:46.493 --> 17:49.163
But Buster isn't an elite long jumper,

17:49.164 --> 17:51.043
so he is going to need a boost.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.735
Buster can't jump on his own,

17:52.736 --> 17:53.941
we need to help him

17:53.942 --> 17:56.650
by giving him upward and forward momentum.

17:56.651 --> 17:59.049
And to do that, we're gonna use this,

17:59.195 --> 18:00.743
Nitrogen cannons.

18:00.744 --> 18:02.566
Since the cannon will ultimately be

18:02.566 --> 18:05.639
just a hop, skip and jump from an explosion,

18:05.640 --> 18:07.395
And that's so heavy.

18:07.594 --> 18:09.122
for its own protection,

18:09.123 --> 18:10.840
it gets a full metal jacket.

18:10.841 --> 18:11.702
There it is.

18:11.703 --> 18:12.430
It's beautiful.

18:12.431 --> 18:13.425
Hello

18:13.426 --> 18:14.782
Cannon in a box.

18:14.924 --> 18:17.937
Then Tory turns his attention to Buster,

18:18.508 --> 18:21.581
fitting him with a strategically placed rod

18:21.582 --> 18:24.368
that will launch him at the perfect angle from the cannon.

18:26.459 --> 18:27.574
Landed.

18:27.575 --> 18:28.870
With the rig set,

18:28.871 --> 18:30.692
Sometimes you just need a cape.

18:30.693 --> 18:34.675
will jump and flesh match the professional jump distance

18:34.676 --> 18:36.771
and hang time they need?

18:38.001 --> 18:41.359
Grant charges nitro to 1500 PSI.

18:41.945 --> 18:44.752
All right, ready for the naked avenger.

18:45.148 --> 18:47.593
And Buster is ready for jump off.

18:47.747 --> 18:50.417
3, 2, 1.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.201
He flies through the air without a care in the world.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.513
Let's see how far he went.

18:57.514 --> 19:01.924
That's 32 feet, Buster rear boost was a little too energetic.

19:01.925 --> 19:05.085
He actually smashed into the top of the shelving.

19:05.086 --> 19:08.195
So they dial nitro back for launch No.2.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.443
All right, here we go.

19:09.444 --> 19:11.031
1,000 PSI.

19:11.032 --> 19:13.379
3, 2, 1.

19:15.332 --> 19:16.519
I think that's it.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.194
Cool.

19:17.195 --> 19:19.830
This time, at around 60% of psi,

19:19.831 --> 19:21.754
buster flew 25 feet,

19:21.755 --> 19:24.463
within the professional range they were looking for.

19:24.464 --> 19:28.413
And the high speed confirms a one second hang time.

19:28.414 --> 19:30.377
That was a near perfect flight.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.562
But for due diligence, they try multiple jumps.

19:33.657 --> 19:35.182
Each time the nitro cannon

19:35.183 --> 19:39.758
gets them a perfect combination of distance and hang time.

19:40.049 --> 19:44.409
So, setting the air cannon at 1,000 PSI is giving us a consistent jump,

19:44.410 --> 19:46.458
sending buster 25 feet.

19:46.459 --> 19:48.171
That's good enough for an elite jumper,

19:48.172 --> 19:50.325
that's good enough for an action hero.

19:50.370 --> 19:53.550
And it's good enough to bring on the booms.

19:58.332 --> 20:00.795
Usually in a car chase shoot-them-up,

20:00.796 --> 20:02.574
the shooters aim at each other.

20:02.693 --> 20:07.220
But this myth is all about taking them out with a sneaky undershot.

20:07.508 --> 20:08.673
Fire.

20:08.674 --> 20:09.635
So far,

20:09.636 --> 20:12.536
the "Mythbusters" have gotten the mythical bullet bounce.

20:14.564 --> 20:15.572
It went through.

20:15.573 --> 20:19.016
But will that change when they start to ricochet in motion?

20:19.017 --> 20:20.432
We'll find that out,

20:20.433 --> 20:23.672
Adam and Jamie have to track the trajectory of

20:23.673 --> 20:25.215
the bouncing bullet at 40 miles an hour.

20:28.241 --> 20:31.228
So they puzzled out an ingenius solution.

20:31.485 --> 20:34.891
This is the rig we have designed to find this out.

20:34.892 --> 20:36.219
It is effectively a trailer,

20:36.220 --> 20:37.934
except it is an open frame.

20:37.935 --> 20:39.950
Mounted to one rail, a high speed camera,

20:39.951 --> 20:42.099
mounted to the other a measurement gauge.

20:42.099 --> 20:44.960
To make sure the bullet hits the ground precisely

20:44.961 --> 20:46.963
where we want to and at the angle we need,

20:46.964 --> 20:48.925
we're going to have our gun hard mounted to

20:48.926 --> 20:50.886
a mast in the bed of the pickup truck.

20:50.887 --> 20:51.584
All we need to do is

20:51.585 --> 20:53.278
to get this to 40 miles a hour,

20:53.279 --> 20:55.777
fire the gun, catch it on high speed.

20:55.778 --> 20:58.357
And we will learn whether or not 40 miles a hour

20:58.358 --> 21:00.883
makes a difference to the exit trajectory.

21:01.114 --> 21:04.830
It's got to do a complicated job, but it's a simple bill.

21:05.618 --> 21:08.556
And in no time at all, they're back out at the range

21:08.557 --> 21:11.159
with a lime rig ready for the limelight.

21:11.160 --> 21:11.799
Awesome.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.711
Look at that. It's like it was designed for us.

21:13.712 --> 21:17.038
So to find out if the bullet will still bounce at speed,

21:17.039 --> 21:18.286
that's the plan.

21:18.287 --> 21:21.072
This is how our traveling bullet rig is gonna work.

21:21.353 --> 21:22.728
While Jamie gets the truck up to

21:22.729 --> 21:23.978
40 to 45 miles per hour,

21:23.979 --> 21:27.681
I will be sitting in the back, protected by this bulletproof shield.

21:27.682 --> 21:28.873
When we get to the right spot,

21:28.874 --> 21:31.550
I will pull this string, firing the gun.

21:32.003 --> 21:34.831
And when the bullet hits right around here,

21:34.835 --> 21:37.471
we're gonna be recording it on the high speed camera.

21:37.507 --> 21:38.785
Then we're gonna crunch the numbers.

21:38.786 --> 21:40.025
And at that point, we will know whether

21:40.026 --> 21:42.348
the gun moving 40 miles per hour over the ground

21:42.349 --> 21:45.329
effects either exit trajectory or speed.

21:45.904 --> 21:49.440
Yep, this is where the lead hits the road at the best case

21:49.441 --> 21:52.004
scenario angle of 16 degrees.

21:52.233 --> 21:53.907
Rolling gun test.

21:53.967 --> 21:56.956
3, 2, 1 go.

21:56.957 --> 21:58.320
But will the road ricochet

21:58.321 --> 22:01.046
change its trajectory and speed?

22:02.319 --> 22:04.803
Jamie guns the truck to the speed from the clip

22:04.804 --> 22:06.283
and gives Adam his cue.

22:06.597 --> 22:07.818
You're at 45.

22:07.819 --> 22:08.677
Here we go.

22:08.678 --> 22:09.750
Firing!

22:13.427 --> 22:15.277
All right. The gun is fired.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.655
The bullet fired.

22:16.656 --> 22:18.281
But how did it bounce?

22:20.995 --> 22:22.607
I think that worked perfectly.

22:22.972 --> 22:24.311
We'll see where it hit.

22:24.691 --> 22:25.840
There it is.

22:25.923 --> 22:28.055
Pretty much exactly where we expected it to hit.

22:28.195 --> 22:30.823
Let's review the high speed and see what the data says.

22:31.610 --> 22:34.711
And it turns out that everything worked like clock work.

22:34.874 --> 22:36.111
Excellent.

22:36.170 --> 22:37.378
We caught it.

22:37.379 --> 22:38.057
That's beautiful.

22:38.058 --> 22:41.332
Even with the rig traveling at 45 miles per hour,

22:41.333 --> 22:44.454
amazingly they captured the split second skip.

22:44.459 --> 22:47.532
And crucially for the myth, the bullet rebounded at

22:47.532 --> 22:51.158
950 feet per second, and at a 10 degree angle,

22:51.158 --> 22:54.123
exactly matching the static results.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.331
This one is cool, dude.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.670
I mean having tested all the constituent parts,

22:57.671 --> 22:59.570
I wouldn't called this,

22:59.571 --> 23:02.391
but I'm starting to think that this thing might actually be plausible.

23:02.491 --> 23:05.272
Well, let's put everything together and go full scale.

23:05.419 --> 23:06.677
Absolutely.

23:11.038 --> 23:13.417
Do not try what you're about to see at home.

23:13.578 --> 23:15.791
We're what you call experts.

23:23.827 --> 23:26.073
Ok, so now we've got buster rigged so he can jump

23:26.074 --> 23:28.925
with the distance and hang time of an olympic athlete.

23:28.926 --> 23:29.881
What's next?

23:29.882 --> 23:32.982
I think maybe we should set buster about 50 feet away from the blast

23:32.983 --> 23:35.305
just like you would see in any typical action movie.

23:35.306 --> 23:36.471
Sounds like solid distance.

23:36.472 --> 23:38.459
And then when he's halfway through his jump,

23:38.460 --> 23:39.944
we set off the explosion

23:39.945 --> 23:42.557
and see if the shock wave will pushes him any further

23:42.558 --> 23:44.185
then he can jump on his own power.

23:44.186 --> 23:45.855
Cool, but I've got one addition.

23:45.856 --> 23:47.113
You know the movies have used

23:47.114 --> 23:48.545
all different types of explosives,

23:48.546 --> 23:49.977
different sizes of blasts,

23:49.978 --> 23:51.687
why don't we do multiple blasts,

23:51.688 --> 23:54.941
and increase the explosive each time depending on result.

23:55.353 --> 23:56.685
- I am not gonna argue with that. - Me neither.

23:58.025 --> 23:59.104
That's the plan.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.422
And to begin the blockbuster blitz,

24:02.217 --> 24:04.744
where better than Angel's Camp quarry.

24:04.745 --> 24:06.952
This is the best location.

24:06.953 --> 24:10.629
The home of some of the biggest bangs in "Mythbusters" history.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.645
So curious to see if this actually works.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.640
Leaping dummies and explosions.

24:17.641 --> 24:19.048
I can't think of anything better.

24:19.049 --> 24:20.965
It's a bombastic combo.

24:20.966 --> 24:22.809
But before buster gets a leaping,

24:22.810 --> 24:24.655
Tory needs to make the earth move.

24:24.656 --> 24:26.406
Have one more dig then we're there.

24:26.407 --> 24:29.231
Since the nitro-cannon will be boosting buster from ground level,

24:29.674 --> 24:31.670
it needs to get down and dirty.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.219
Perfect.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.392
Perfect, and protected from explosive action.

24:36.393 --> 24:39.803
But to time the jump and blast just right,

24:39.804 --> 24:42.689
nitro is gonna need a very tricky trigger.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.695
This right here is the trigger for the cannon.

24:45.696 --> 24:47.385
Frank initiates the blast,

24:47.453 --> 24:50.854
it's gonna come down the line of shock tube and split in two directions.

24:50.862 --> 24:52.547
The first's gonna come over here,

24:52.548 --> 24:54.948
it hits this switch, and fires the cannon.

24:54.949 --> 24:57.841
The other side of that goes over to the explosive,

24:57.842 --> 25:01.281
through delay cap that's gonna delay a half second to let buster

25:01.281 --> 25:02.248
get to the top of his arch

25:02.249 --> 25:04.988
before it fires off the explosion.

25:04.989 --> 25:06.961
Once the trigger is taken care of,

25:06.962 --> 25:09.678
enter the stand in action hero.

25:09.690 --> 25:12.233
He's on and he stand.

25:12.234 --> 25:13.174
Proud.

25:13.722 --> 25:15.838
Wait, why are we dressing him like a commando?

25:17.690 --> 25:20.922
And with buster in position, the first order of business,

25:20.923 --> 25:22.966
is to check the timing on Grant's trigger,

25:22.967 --> 25:24.791
Okey, we are at 1,000 PSI.

25:24.792 --> 25:28.669
and find out how far buster jumps without explosives.

25:28.670 --> 25:30.891
In 3, 2, 1.

25:34.734 --> 25:35.781
That was great.

25:35.782 --> 25:36.645
Hilarious.

25:36.646 --> 25:37.933
So far, so good.

25:37.934 --> 25:39.434
Just like the shop test,

25:39.435 --> 25:41.386
the cannon sent buster flying.

25:41.711 --> 25:43.762
Measure from the hips like a long jump.

25:44.303 --> 25:45.859
But how far?

25:46.158 --> 25:47.228
How far did he go?

25:47.229 --> 25:48.730
27 feet.

25:48.869 --> 25:49.960
At altitudes,

25:49.961 --> 25:52.324
that cannon gives buster a little more boost,

25:52.325 --> 25:54.765
setting the control at 27 feet.

25:54.766 --> 25:56.417
But what about the timing?

25:56.750 --> 25:58.947
So our timing system worked out, which is great news.

25:58.948 --> 26:01.924
Because this experiment is all about timing.

26:01.925 --> 26:04.292
You can see from the higher speed, he goes up,

26:04.293 --> 26:07.385
and the explosive goes off right at the top of his arc.

26:07.388 --> 26:10.689
So now it's time for us to load up 10 pounds of C4,

26:10.797 --> 26:14.720
see if our commando buddy can beat 27 feet.

26:14.844 --> 26:16.108
Yep, that's the plan.

26:16.109 --> 26:20.161
So it's over to explosives expert Frank to wire up the C4,

26:20.565 --> 26:22.892
Let's keep the this end pointed away from you.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.616
while Grant primes the trigger and cannon.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.017
Nitrogen is loaded.

26:30.018 --> 26:30.850
This is it.

26:30.851 --> 26:32.935
The moment of truth for the myth.

26:32.957 --> 26:33.975
Special delivery.

26:33.976 --> 26:36.455
Will the shock wave from 10 pounds of C4

26:36.456 --> 26:38.605
extend buster's jump?

26:38.606 --> 26:40.201
Comes the firing line.

26:40.693 --> 26:43.090
Well there's only one way to find out.

26:43.190 --> 26:45.009
Safely back in the bunker,

26:45.009 --> 26:47.326
1,000 feet away from launch,

26:47.327 --> 26:49.063
I never get tired of this.

26:49.064 --> 26:50.817
All right, arming.

26:51.397 --> 26:54.206
it is time to count backwards, three.

26:54.207 --> 26:57.966
In 3 2 1, fire.

27:01.129 --> 27:03.298
Wow, that happened so fast.

27:03.385 --> 27:04.782
We're gonna have to look at the high speed

27:04.783 --> 27:06.319
to see exactly what happened.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.276
But I don't know.

27:07.937 --> 27:09.599
Well it's clear from the high speed that

27:09.600 --> 27:11.558
buster's jump peaked

27:11.559 --> 27:13.028
as the shock wave reached him.

27:13.072 --> 27:16.324
But did he fly further than 27 feet?

27:16.448 --> 27:17.524
All right, what you got?

27:17.656 --> 27:18.832
27 feet.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.084
So that's a negative on C4.

27:21.353 --> 27:23.104
That's a negative on the C4.

27:23.105 --> 27:24.815
But when it comes to myth busting,

27:24.816 --> 27:27.551
well, one boom is never enough.

27:27.552 --> 27:29.412
You can definitely feel that thud.

27:31.814 --> 27:32.789
For those of you playing at home,

27:32.790 --> 27:33.784
we've been testing the myth

27:33.785 --> 27:35.143
that if someone is chasing you in a car

27:35.144 --> 27:36.805
and you don't want to kill them firing bullets

27:36.806 --> 27:37.525
through their windshield,

27:38.226 --> 27:41.008
you instead can skip bullets off the ground,

27:41.009 --> 27:42.917
that would supposably pierce the under side of the car,

27:42.918 --> 27:44.583
distract the driver, make him stop chasing.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.794
So far we've discovered that bullets bounce off the ground

27:46.795 --> 27:48.576
at reasonable angles for this to be possible.

27:48.577 --> 27:50.819
They in fact actually can, even after bouncing,

27:50.820 --> 27:52.584
pierce the underside of the car.

27:52.585 --> 27:54.960
Now we're about to put all of the knowledge we gathered together

27:54.960 --> 27:57.403
into one large, full scale, full speed experiment,

27:57.404 --> 27:59.652
and we're gonna be shooting at this very car.

27:59.904 --> 28:00.655
Are you ready?

28:00.656 --> 28:01.335
Definitely.

28:01.336 --> 28:04.837
But first, the "Mythbusters" have to rejig their rig.

28:04.904 --> 28:08.896
As this time, it is towing a car, not a trailer.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.944
And they need to leave room for the bullet to hit its target.

28:11.945 --> 28:14.749
This arrow right here describes our target sweet spot.

28:14.816 --> 28:17.452
This is the bulkhead, this is the wheel well.

28:17.472 --> 28:21.629
This little area right here is how much it is visible to our bullet.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.416
That's where we've got to hit.

28:23.417 --> 28:24.704
That's our postage stamp.

28:24.705 --> 28:27.477
With the gun loaded, Adam's feeling optimistic.

28:27.601 --> 28:28.709
Gun is hot.

28:28.953 --> 28:32.663
Every step of this story, I have been wrong about my intuition.

28:32.664 --> 28:33.562
At the beginning, I thought

28:33.563 --> 28:35.327
from physics stand point it is quite a stretch,

28:35.328 --> 28:37.145
I didn't think bullets would skip off the ground

28:37.146 --> 28:39.152
at any significant angle or significant speed.

28:39.153 --> 28:41.359
But it turns out both are plausible.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.674
Now that we've got all this set up,

28:42.675 --> 28:46.415
I have to admit the feelings of true optimism.

28:46.449 --> 28:49.781
I feel like we're gonna get a successful hit on this one.

28:52.249 --> 28:55.581
We are literally on the highway to the danger zone.

28:58.144 --> 29:03.173
Ok. Taking off in 3, 2, 1.

29:04.737 --> 29:07.064
As they ride into the danger zone,

29:07.065 --> 29:10.176
Jamie guns the car to car chase speed.

29:10.177 --> 29:11.296
45.

29:11.297 --> 29:15.004
And then it is over to Adam for a barrage of bouncing bullets.

29:15.481 --> 29:16.895
All right. Firing.

29:16.896 --> 29:21.207
One, two, three, four, five.

29:23.915 --> 29:24.834
Ok, stop.

29:27.112 --> 29:28.790
That seemed to work beautifully, dude.

29:28.873 --> 29:30.614
Five bullets bounced.

29:30.615 --> 29:33.115
But did any make that mythical target?

29:33.116 --> 29:34.703
Interior inspection.

29:36.578 --> 29:38.231
Interior is clean.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.575
No penetration.

29:39.576 --> 29:41.381
No, not that I can see.

29:41.473 --> 29:44.613
Inside the cab, there's no sign of penetration.

29:44.832 --> 29:47.380
And to look underneath reveals why.

29:48.056 --> 29:49.519
I can see four of the bullets.

29:49.520 --> 29:53.095
They just bounced into the swing arm on the way to find the fire wall,

29:53.096 --> 29:55.704
- It's in the way. - Close but no cigar.

29:55.705 --> 29:56.669
Exactly.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.332
A close shot.

30:00.096 --> 30:01.719
But although the bullets bounced,

30:01.720 --> 30:05.004
there was just too much car in the line of fire.

30:06.432 --> 30:10.968
But the "Mythbusters" have come too far to give up after only one run.

30:10.969 --> 30:12.408
So they reset,

30:12.409 --> 30:13.544
Excellent.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.655
3, 2, 1. Go.

30:16.656 --> 30:19.383
and unleash another five bullets.

30:19.384 --> 30:23.440
Firing one, two, three, four, five.

30:23.441 --> 30:26.432
But once again, they're floored by the floor.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.701
They definitely didn't come through this piece of cardboard.

30:29.217 --> 30:30.104
I have to admit,

30:30.105 --> 30:32.543
I'm a little disappointed after everything we learned so far,

30:32.544 --> 30:34.906
it seemed so within our grasp,

30:35.073 --> 30:37.779
so plausible-like,

30:37.832 --> 30:40.328
but it just turns out there's too much crap

30:40.329 --> 30:42.808
underneath this car that is in the bullet's way

30:42.809 --> 30:45.424
on its trajectory towards the fire wall.

30:45.425 --> 30:48.171
This is the exact make and model of car

30:48.171 --> 30:49.671
that's in the clip we're testing.

30:49.672 --> 30:52.607
Yep, the gun, the car, it all matches.

30:52.608 --> 30:57.208
But even though firing point blank at the bottom of the car might work.

30:57.209 --> 30:58.248
Looks like an almost perfect hit.

30:58.249 --> 30:58.968
In reality,

30:58.969 --> 31:00.880
a bouncing bullet just doesn't have

31:00.881 --> 31:03.228
a clear path through to the wheel well.

31:03.273 --> 31:04.055
Coming up.

31:04.056 --> 31:05.767
Got to say I'm disappointed in this one.

31:05.768 --> 31:07.607
I was really hoping it worked.

31:07.608 --> 31:09.976
Yeah, but you know what, if you want a nonlethal way

31:09.977 --> 31:11.786
of getting a guy to stop following you,

31:11.787 --> 31:13.826
you should just shoot the darn tire.

31:13.827 --> 31:16.310
We should totally do that.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.446
Why not.

31:26.325 --> 31:29.025
It is a myth ripped straight from the big screen.

31:29.627 --> 31:31.762
Our hero runs from an explosion,

31:31.763 --> 31:33.803
and at the last second jumps,

31:33.804 --> 31:38.342
supposably surging the shock wave for super human strength.

31:38.498 --> 31:41.537
And despite exploding ten pounds of C4,

31:42.394 --> 31:44.369
50 feet from Buster,

31:44.370 --> 31:48.345
There's been no shock wave surfing, well not yet.

31:48.346 --> 31:51.249
For our first experiment we used ten pounds of C4.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.453
We did see the wave propagate through Buster

31:53.454 --> 31:55.457
just as he hit the peak of his jump,

31:55.458 --> 31:57.033
exactly where it should have been,

31:57.034 --> 31:59.648
though it did not change the trajectory of the jump

31:59.649 --> 32:01.340
nor distance that he jumped.

32:01.341 --> 32:05.335
So now we're moving to a low velocity explosive, ANFO.

32:05.335 --> 32:07.310
This should be really interesting.

32:07.594 --> 32:10.393
C4 is a high brisance explosive.

32:10.393 --> 32:12.858
It delivers a rapid shock impulse

32:12.858 --> 32:15.305
and shatters objects in close proximity.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.783
However, ANFO is a low brisance explosive

32:18.783 --> 32:21.521
meaning that it will heave and throw objects.

32:22.025 --> 32:25.771
But does that mean that it can heave and throw our commando?

32:25.999 --> 32:29.492
Unfortunately for Buster, he's about to find out.

32:29.704 --> 32:33.588
That's ten pounds of low velocity explosive, ANFO.

32:36.281 --> 32:38.112
All right this is ten pounds of ANFO.

32:38.113 --> 32:39.924
See if he rides that shock wave.

32:40.424 --> 32:44.092
In three, two, one, fire.

32:51.401 --> 32:52.661
Let's see what happened.

32:53.728 --> 32:58.231
The ANFO definitely packed a punch, and the shock wave is clear to see.

32:58.232 --> 33:00.812
But did Buster hitch a ride?

33:01.440 --> 33:02.612
All right what did we get?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.348
27 feet.

33:04.424 --> 33:05.143
That's it?

33:05.144 --> 33:06.436
So he didn't go any farther.

33:07.081 --> 33:08.839
It's the same result again.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.983
Despite changing explosives,

33:10.984 --> 33:13.500
Buster didn't surf the shock wave.

33:14.336 --> 33:16.943
So far everything we tried has failed.

33:16.944 --> 33:19.439
That's ten pounds of ANFO, ten pounds of C4.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.917
Neither one has moved him any further than no explosive at all.

33:23.120 --> 33:27.176
So next stop, we're gonna to more than double that to 25 pounds.

33:27.352 --> 33:30.552
Personal feeling, it's not gonna make a difference.

33:30.553 --> 33:34.575
Ok, here we go with 25 pounds of ANFO.

33:34.576 --> 33:35.572
Arming?

33:35.888 --> 33:40.035
In 3, 2, 1. Fire.

33:42.712 --> 33:44.927
That was a healthy shock wave.

33:44.928 --> 33:46.303
Do you think he jumped further?

33:46.304 --> 33:48.284
I don't know, let's check the high speed.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.408
That felt good.

33:51.869 --> 33:55.175
Doubling up on the ANFO certainly doubled the fun.

33:56.164 --> 33:58.792
But did it pick up Buster along the way?

34:00.604 --> 34:04.584
Ok, and we have 27 again.

34:04.604 --> 34:06.351
So he hasn't moved at all.

34:08.540 --> 34:12.498
25 pounds of ANFO and still 27 feet.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.763
But as the "Mythbusters"saying goes, if worth doing,

34:15.764 --> 34:19.952
it is worth overdoing with 100 pounds of ANFO.

34:25.246 --> 34:26.837
Down at Tracy Airport,

34:26.838 --> 34:30.275
the "Mythbusters" are ready to make the rubber meet the round.

34:30.799 --> 34:33.989
Have bullet bouncing into the wheel well is busted.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.996
So they're taking aim at the actual wheels.

34:36.998 --> 34:39.610
Now this is a fun way to get to the location.

34:40.598 --> 34:42.597
On the movies, somebody shoots the tire,

34:42.598 --> 34:45.195
tire explodes and car spins out of control.

34:46.367 --> 34:48.245
I don't know whether that's going to happen or not,

34:48.246 --> 34:50.592
but I know if you shoot a tire,

34:50.782 --> 34:52.301
you are gonna put a hole in it,

34:52.302 --> 34:53.692
And it will deflate.

34:53.693 --> 34:56.460
The real question here is how quickly is that gonna happen,

34:56.462 --> 34:59.018
because if it does happen quickly,

34:59.102 --> 35:01.422
that's gonna be a problem for the driver,

35:01.423 --> 35:04.722
and he is gonna have a hard time maintaining that pursuit.

35:04.950 --> 35:06.266
That's gonna work perfectly.

35:07.045 --> 35:09.206
The rig for this test is pretty straightforward.

35:09.207 --> 35:11.343
I have welded a platform to the frame of the car

35:11.344 --> 35:12.767
right in front of the tire.

35:12.768 --> 35:15.107
I'll attach a loaded pistol with a string

35:15.107 --> 35:16.224
goes from the trigger pull

35:16.225 --> 35:18.060
all the way to me in the driver's compartment.

35:18.061 --> 35:19.330
When I gets the car to 45 miles an hour

35:19.331 --> 35:20.568
and I want to shoot out the tire,

35:20.569 --> 35:23.614
I pull the string pulling the trigger, put a hole in the tire.

35:24.439 --> 35:27.740
However Adam's safety is not gonna be quite so straightforward.

35:27.741 --> 35:29.877
Basically because the gun is gonna be mounted

35:29.878 --> 35:32.177
in the front of the car facing back,

35:32.397 --> 35:34.785
which puts Adam in the line of fire.

35:34.997 --> 35:37.924
And we thought to mitigate this in every way we can conceive of.

35:37.925 --> 35:41.940
We line the inside and back of the wheel well with bulletproof vests.

35:41.943 --> 35:44.542
And in addition, we've lined the engine compartment

35:45.001 --> 35:47.068
with several layered of bulletproof vests.

35:47.366 --> 35:49.765
On top of that, we've lined the inside of the car

35:49.766 --> 35:51.970
and Adam's seat with bullet proof vests.

35:51.971 --> 35:54.577
Finally, I'll be wearing one.

35:54.578 --> 35:55.705
I think we're ready.

35:55.706 --> 35:56.710
Let's do it.

35:57.578 --> 36:00.106
All right everybody, here we go, shooting out the tire.

36:00.107 --> 36:04.327
In 3, 2, 1. Here we go.

36:07.011 --> 36:07.649
Once again,

36:07.650 --> 36:11.361
Adam gets the car to the 45 miles per hour car chase speed,

36:11.362 --> 36:13.206
and then it's over to the bullets.

36:14.771 --> 36:15.943
Here we go, firing.

36:18.267 --> 36:21.306
The bullets take out enough rubber to blackout the camera.

36:21.307 --> 36:23.015
But when it comes to the car...

36:24.162 --> 36:25.689
I don't notice anything.

36:25.690 --> 36:28.830
And this car is still totally within my control.

36:28.930 --> 36:32.146
Look, I can actually steer like this and it's not a problem.

36:32.147 --> 36:33.298
This is nothing.

36:33.299 --> 36:37.185
It may be nothing now, but it's just a question of time.

36:37.186 --> 36:40.102
My tire's been shot and nothing happened.

36:40.562 --> 36:42.129
All right. I'm stopping here.

36:42.130 --> 36:43.801
Half a mile down the track,

36:43.802 --> 36:46.895
and Adam has no alternative but to stop.

36:47.410 --> 36:48.431
I lived.

36:49.603 --> 36:51.034
How does that tire look?

36:51.035 --> 36:52.183
It's flat.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.329
That totally works.

36:54.330 --> 36:57.145
It wasn't instantaneous, but that'd stop a pursuit.

36:57.146 --> 37:00.870
That would totally put an end to a pursuit.

37:00.994 --> 37:04.530
It might not spin the car out of control Hollywood style,

37:04.531 --> 37:08.457
but it is more effective than a bounced bullet at stopping a car.

37:08.458 --> 37:09.949
So skipping bullets off the ground

37:09.950 --> 37:12.230
as a reliable technique for stopping a pursuit?

37:12.386 --> 37:13.297
Totally busted.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.751
If you're gonna shoot at something, shoot at the tires.

37:16.259 --> 37:17.201
Let's get out of here.

37:17.202 --> 37:18.754
Yeah, well, we're not driving.

37:25.221 --> 37:29.174
Next, the surf a shock wave finale goes out with a bang.

37:29.175 --> 37:30.813
All right, 100 pounds of ANFO.

37:30.814 --> 37:33.176
Let's send the action hero flying.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.843
So far, we have thoroughly tested this myth.

37:42.844 --> 37:47.377
We have an action hero jumping 50 feet from an explosion.

37:47.378 --> 37:48.890
Our timing has been perfect.

37:48.891 --> 37:51.040
We started off with ten pounds of C4.

37:51.668 --> 37:53.599
We've gone to ten pounds of ANFO,

37:54.323 --> 37:56.607
then ramped it up to 25 pounds.

37:57.139 --> 38:00.434
Still, the shock wave is not enough to push him forward.

38:00.435 --> 38:02.947
Now we're gonna move on to 100 pounds.

38:02.948 --> 38:06.520
Four times the explosive might sound like overkill,

38:06.524 --> 38:09.522
but this is the boom or bust test.

38:09.523 --> 38:13.863
So far, we haven't actually seen any extra jump distance.

38:14.379 --> 38:17.087
I'm not so sure we're going to see any with this either.

38:17.939 --> 38:19.707
But I'm still crossing my fingers.

38:19.708 --> 38:22.192
With a hefty pile of ANFO about to go boom,

38:23.061 --> 38:24.992
and the cannon primed,

38:25.051 --> 38:28.895
maybe this is what it will take for buster to hang ten.

38:30.026 --> 38:31.370
Somebody order an explosion?

38:31.371 --> 38:32.426
Everybody ready?

38:32.427 --> 38:33.495
Ok, here we go.

38:34.203 --> 38:35.240
Arming.

38:35.315 --> 38:39.918
In 3, 2, 1. Fire.

38:41.899 --> 38:43.886
Bang. That was a big blast.

38:44.139 --> 38:45.502
- Nice dust cloud. - Yeah.

38:47.843 --> 38:49.479
I can't even see him.

38:49.507 --> 38:51.123
All right, as soon as the dust cloud clears,

38:51.124 --> 38:52.608
maybe we can see if he went any further.

38:53.454 --> 38:55.147
100 pounds of ANFO

38:55.148 --> 38:57.513
and the "Mythbusters" jumping out of their skin.

38:57.514 --> 39:01.284
But did that impressive shock wave send buster surfing?

39:04.143 --> 39:07.647
The same, 27 feet.

39:07.648 --> 39:09.607
100 pounds of ANFO, he didn't move at all.

39:09.608 --> 39:12.855
27 feet again, I so wanted this to work.

39:12.856 --> 39:15.151
I don't know, maybe it is just watching too many action films.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.991
But I really wanted this one to happen.

39:16.992 --> 39:19.319
Well I guess we've got no choice but to call this busted.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.083
Can't surf a shock wave.

39:22.448 --> 39:24.322
All right, so this myth is totally busted.

39:24.323 --> 39:25.527
Yeah, but it has me wondering,

39:25.528 --> 39:27.327
do you think there's any way to surf a shock wave?

39:27.328 --> 39:29.177
I don't know, what if we're able to

39:29.178 --> 39:31.767
increase your surface area by a huge amount,

39:31.768 --> 39:33.855
Maybe having that much more surface area,

39:33.856 --> 39:36.110
you might catch the shock wave, push you a little bit further.

39:36.111 --> 39:38.510
So maybe we built something to attach to Buster

39:38.511 --> 39:40.247
to act as shock wave catcher?

39:40.248 --> 39:42.828
Exactly, I know just what to build it on.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.919
For his shock wave enhancer,

39:44.920 --> 39:49.128
Tory's turning to combination of the familiar and bizarre.

39:49.129 --> 39:51.855
A steel frame and a blanket?

39:51.856 --> 39:53.558
You're probably asking yourself wait a minute,

39:53.559 --> 39:56.438
the blanket is not gonna withstand the blast, and you're right.

39:56.439 --> 39:59.431
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna spray it with bed liner.

39:59.432 --> 40:04.303
Cause as you remember, bed liner is blast proof.

40:04.304 --> 40:07.580
After a quick spray of bed liner to harden it up,

40:08.107 --> 40:09.942
the team is back at the quarry

40:09.943 --> 40:11.357
Flying a giant kite, hum?

40:11.480 --> 40:13.929
We'll see, it's like a big sail.

40:13.930 --> 40:16.380
to give Buster his bomb proof blanket

40:16.381 --> 40:18.835
That is gorgeous. Let's see if he flies.

40:18.918 --> 40:20.470
for a control test.

40:20.841 --> 40:23.463
In 3, 2, 1, fire.

40:26.384 --> 40:27.387
Perfect.

40:27.388 --> 40:32.249
The heavier rig has Buster fly a slightly shorter 23 feet,

40:32.250 --> 40:35.145
but will the explosion fling him further?

40:35.146 --> 40:36.361
Ok, here's the thing.

40:36.362 --> 40:39.768
The reason why I think Buster hasn't jumped much further so far,

40:39.769 --> 40:42.521
is because while the shock wave moves quickly,

40:42.522 --> 40:45.137
it only moves a relatively small amount of air,

40:45.138 --> 40:47.372
a layer, perhaps 12 inches thick.

40:47.373 --> 40:50.738
And that's not enough force to push him any further.

40:50.932 --> 40:52.599
Now this rig has the advantage of

40:52.600 --> 40:55.428
having a lot of surface area to catch a shock wave.

40:55.429 --> 40:58.391
But unfortunately, it adds a lot of weight.

40:58.428 --> 41:02.312
So the net result, I think is that he is not going to go much further.

41:02.676 --> 41:05.827
Well with 100 pounds of ANFO set to detonate,

41:05.828 --> 41:07.576
will the extra surface area

41:07.816 --> 41:10.896
finally get buster surfing the shock wave?

41:11.101 --> 41:14.187
All right, this is the final experiment riding a shock wave,

41:14.188 --> 41:15.680
this time with the sail.

41:16.244 --> 41:20.096
3, 2, 1. Firing.

41:23.980 --> 41:25.684
Well I never get tired of that.

41:25.685 --> 41:27.360
I can't tell what happened.

41:27.618 --> 41:30.578
The cannon triggered, the ANFO went off.

41:30.579 --> 41:35.030
And it seems as though the shock wave did in fact give buster a boost.

41:35.690 --> 41:37.943
But did he travel any further?

41:38.891 --> 41:39.879
Five feet.

41:40.371 --> 41:42.927
I can't wait to see if it worked.

41:43.571 --> 41:44.702
Ten feet.

41:45.242 --> 41:46.631
Fifteen feet.

41:47.075 --> 41:48.527
20 feet.

41:50.186 --> 41:51.711
23 feet.

41:51.850 --> 41:54.474
What? He didn't go any further at all.

41:54.475 --> 41:56.345
That was the same as the control test.

41:56.346 --> 41:57.964
Ok, we gave it everything we got.

41:57.965 --> 42:01.904
And we still didn't get that Hollywood style jump and then just blow up.

42:01.905 --> 42:04.527
All right, well, I guess it is busted.

42:04.557 --> 42:06.454
I'm a little disappointed in Hollywood.

42:06.455 --> 42:08.760
All right, that's busted.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.255
Busted. Again.

42:11.258 --> 42:13.902
And that was so cool to watch him jump through the air

42:13.903 --> 42:15.988
and explosion going off.

42:16.727 --> 42:19.505
And you know what, being an action hero is a tough job.

42:25.985 --> 42:27.516
Want to know why we did what we did

42:27.517 --> 42:29.048
and didn't do what we didn't do?

42:29.049 --> 42:32.572
