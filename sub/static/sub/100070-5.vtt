00:55.160 --> 00:57.359
I thought I told you
to leave your spots alone.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.159
But they looked horrible.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.159
I also told you
to stop using make-up.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.519
I thought you were joking
about that.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.159
Why would I joke about that?

01:05.160 --> 01:08.159
Make-up clogs the pores, which leads
to a build-up of oil and bacteria,

01:08.160 --> 01:10.159
which leads to acne
and inflammation.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.159
It's been two weeks,
and my skin still looks rubbish.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.159
Those pills you gave me
aren't working.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.839
Why do you come here
if you won't listen to me?

01:18.840 --> 01:21.159
I told you, doxycycline
can take up to three months

01:21.160 --> 01:22.160
to become effective.

01:22.161 --> 01:24.159
But three months is ages.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.160
I'm going to be a social piranha.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.359
- Those pills are giving me
headaches too. - They shouldn't.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.159
When did that start?

01:35.160 --> 01:36.160
- Doc.
- Whoa!

01:36.161 --> 01:38.159
Joe, I told you
not to go barging in.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.159
Doc, you need to come.
Someone's been shot.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.359
- Where?
- I don't know.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.159
It's not life-threatening,
so I'm guessing the buttocks.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.159
He means what place.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.160
Oh, Casworon Farm.

01:47.161 --> 01:49.159
Come on, Doc.
I'll drive you up there.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.159
- I was here first.
- I have an emergency.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.690
Make another appointment
for this afternoon.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.158
Morning, Bert.

02:09.160 --> 02:13.679
Just to let you know, I've got
a "for sale" sign to put up outside.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.159
Now, give me a minute here.
We agreed a deal with Ken.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.159
Well that "deal" is null and void,

02:18.160 --> 02:20.159
now he's playing a harp
up on a cloud somewhere.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.160
What's happening?

02:21.161 --> 02:25.159
The pub was left to Ken's sister,
and she wants to sell.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.159
It's, it's not all bad news though.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.359
In line with Ken's wishes,
it won't be sold to a brewery.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.839
Only offers from an individual,

02:32.840 --> 02:34.199
and preferably local,
will be considered.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.999
Like us?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.159
Like you...

02:38.160 --> 02:39.160
Now you're talking.

02:39.161 --> 02:41.159
But with deeper pockets, I imagine.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.159
Have a look at that.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.160
I'll be in touch.
Cheery bye.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.160
There he is.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.160
Where's the patient?

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
Over here.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.160
In there.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.200
I see.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.199
Where's the wound?

03:28.200 --> 03:30.000
My leg.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.159
Right, I'm going to have to cut your
trousers so I can get at the injury.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
What happened?

03:38.161 --> 03:41.159
What happened
is that psychopath shot me.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.159
No. The gun went off,

03:44.160 --> 03:46.159
and maybe he got hit,

03:46.160 --> 03:49.159
but it was an accidental discharge.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.159
It does sound like you shot him,
Dennis.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.159
If I'd shot him,
I wouldn't have called you.

03:53.160 --> 03:58.159
He's just trying to cover for
the fact that I caught him stealing.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.159
Shush!
What's your name?

04:00.160 --> 04:02.159
Robert. Robert Brook.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.159
- Are you in any pain?
- I've been shot!

04:04.160 --> 04:06.159
Yes, I'm in pain.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.159
Right,
the bullet has grazed your thigh.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.712
It's a superficial wound, I think.
So, you've been lucky.

04:11.713 --> 04:12.713
Lucky (!)

04:12.715 --> 04:15.359
I suppose I should be thankful
I wasn't shot twice.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.678
You're overreacting.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.159
It's a two two.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.159
It's practically harmless.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.999
If that had pierced the muscle
or the bone,

04:22.000 --> 04:23.159
it could have been
extremely serious.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.159
I'll put a dressing on the wound,

04:25.160 --> 04:26.160
but I want you to come
to my surgery.

04:26.161 --> 04:29.159
Then you want to be arresting him.
He was stealing my eggs.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.159
- That's ridiculous.
- Been happening for weeks.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.159
It's nothing to do with me.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.159
All I wanted to do
was buy some eggs.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.159
- Are you making an arrest or not?
- Yes, I am.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.159
Good.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.159
Dennis Thorpe, you're under arrest
for firearms offences.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.160
Second collar this month, Doc...
I'm on a roll.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.159
We could never buy this place.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.159
We can't get enough for a deposit,
never mind financing a loan.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.159
We need some venture capital.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.199
An investor.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.159
She's already said no!

05:04.160 --> 05:07.159
Ruth has backed us before,
we just need to change her mind.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.159
Must be hard for you boys.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.159
This place has practically
become your home.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.200
Caitlin? This is
a private discussion. So...

05:18.160 --> 05:21.159
The goal posts have shifted
now that Ken's gone.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.160
It's still a bad idea.

05:22.161 --> 05:23.999
Well, at least it is an idea.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.160
Which is more than you've had, boy.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.159
Is this going to take long?

05:31.160 --> 05:33.159
You've been shot in the leg.
You're gonna need treatment.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.159
And I'm gonna need
a statement from you.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.359
I'd really rather not.
I'm on holiday.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.159
I'd prefer to return to my camp.

05:39.160 --> 05:42.159
You should've thought of that before
you tried to steal eggs from me!

05:42.160 --> 05:44.160
You're making a big mistake here.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.680
Stay there.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.160
I got you. Lean on me.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.160
Right, Dennis Thorpe,
let's get you processed.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.159
I don't think this online
calculator's working.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.359
I thought I'd be able to borrow
three times as much.

06:22.360 --> 06:27.160
Well, if you lie about how much you
earn then they'll lend you more.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.159
I think they check, though, Dad.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.631
Then we'll have to think
of something else.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.199
Can you tell me, in your own words,

06:41.200 --> 06:44.159
your recollection of events
at Casworon Farm

06:44.160 --> 06:48.680
the morning of Tuesday the 26th,
at approximately 0900 hours?

06:50.160 --> 06:52.160
I heard the chickens squawking.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.159
Normally they don't make much noise
unless there's a problem,

06:56.160 --> 06:59.159
which there was,
someone trying to steal eggs.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.159
Allegedly trying to steal eggs.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.159
And that someone was Robert Brook?

07:03.160 --> 07:06.159
Says he was trying to buy 'em,
it's nonsense.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.159
I've got signs up
all over the place.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.159
"Private property. No entry."
Bugger off."

07:11.160 --> 07:13.359
- And you live there alone?
- Yeah. 20 year now.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.159
When you came out the farmhouse,
you had the two two with you?

07:16.160 --> 07:18.159
I thought it might be a fox.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.159
Then I saw him with the eggs,

07:21.160 --> 07:25.159
so I went to fire off
a warning shot.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.159
You didn't think to speak to him
instead?

07:28.160 --> 07:30.159
If I wanted to speak to people,

07:30.160 --> 07:33.159
I wouldn't have signs up
telling 'em to keep out.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.159
Next thing I know,

07:35.160 --> 07:37.999
the gun goes off, accidentally,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.519
and hits him in the leg.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.159
Are we done here?

07:41.160 --> 07:43.159
What? No.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.159
We've just started.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.159
It's cos of nosy idiots like you
that I don't come off the farm much.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.160
Sorry...

07:49.161 --> 07:53.159
If you could possibly lay off
the insults whilst we're recording,

07:53.160 --> 07:55.160
it makes me sound bad.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.160
Although, if you wanted,

07:57.161 --> 08:00.159
you could mention how swiftly,

08:00.160 --> 08:01.839
and professionally,

08:01.840 --> 08:03.429
I dealt with the situation.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.160
Anything further to add?

08:12.360 --> 08:14.840
Not really, no.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.159
Do you have any other firearms?

08:18.160 --> 08:21.199
- Couple of shotguns.
- Have you got a license for them?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.999
Dunno.
Somewhere.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.159
- I'll need to see it.
- Is that it?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.159
For the moment.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.159
You'll be released
under investigation,

08:28.160 --> 08:31.159
but I'll have to confiscate
your guns and your passport.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.159
You won't be allowed
to travel abroad.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.159
Wouldn't worry about that.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.159
Furthest I've ever been is Torquay.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.159
Is it nice? Torquay.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.159
I've always wanted to go there.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.159
Well, this should drain
any excess fluid out.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.839
How long are you staying here?

08:58.840 --> 09:01.159
I'll need to take the drain out
tomorrow.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.159
Just a few weeks.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.160
Camping.

09:04.161 --> 09:06.519
Getting away from it all.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.679
Bit of peace and quiet,

09:08.680 --> 09:10.520
until this happened.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.159
These stitches'll need
to come out in about ten days.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.159
While I'm here, can I ask you
about my stomach pains?

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
How long have you had them?

09:19.161 --> 09:21.199
I'm not sure, but they've been
getting a lot worse.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.160
Pull up your shirt.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.840
- Any tenderness when I press here?
- No.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.160
Here?

09:32.680 --> 09:34.159
- Here?
- Yes.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.519
Does the pain come in spasms?

09:35.520 --> 09:38.159
- Any loss of appetite?
- I haven't been eating much.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.999
On a scale of one to ten,
how much pain are you in?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.159
Maybe a six. A seven!

09:43.160 --> 09:46.159
All right, pull your trousers up.
And hop off there.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.159
I'll need you to come back tomorrow
for a scan.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.359
Well, I was hoping to spend
some time on my own.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.999
- Can't we just do it now?
- No.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.159
You're coming in tomorrow
to have the drain removed anyway,

09:54.160 --> 09:55.520
I'll do it then.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.159
Doc got you patched up all right?

10:07.160 --> 10:08.160
Er, yes.

10:08.161 --> 10:11.159
Make up a follow-up appointment
for the patient tomorrow, please.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.159
You'll need to fill out
a temporary-patient form.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.159
You're my first gunshot case...

10:16.160 --> 10:18.199
Is it OK if I put
my Bristol address?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.999
- Yeah. That's fine.
- Well, second really.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.159
But first one, I shot myself,

10:22.160 --> 10:24.159
so I don't really count that.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.159
Can I give you a lift
to your campsite?

10:26.160 --> 10:27.160
Er, no! No camping.

10:27.161 --> 10:29.159
That needs to be kept clean and dry.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.159
Daryll Hannah. Go through.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.159
I don't have anywhere to stay
around here.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.159
Or a change of clothes.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.359
- And my wallet's back there.
- We'll sort something out.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.519
I can grab some clothes
from lost property.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.545
Don't worry, I'll look after you,
you're my star witness.

10:45.547 --> 10:47.542
10:50 tomorrow.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.033
Thank you.

11:15.194 --> 11:16.233
Al?

11:16.234 --> 11:18.193
Can you get a room for Mr Brook?

11:18.194 --> 11:20.193
Fella's had quite a time of it.

11:20.194 --> 11:21.393
He was shot.

11:21.394 --> 11:23.193
- Shot?
- Big case.

11:23.194 --> 11:24.194
Firearms.

11:24.195 --> 11:26.193
Might make it onto the news,
if I'm lucky.

11:26.194 --> 11:28.193
Idiot farmer didn't realise
I was buying eggs.

11:28.194 --> 11:30.873
Look, I'm sorry, but as I explained
to the policeman,

11:30.874 --> 11:32.193
I don't have any money on me.

11:32.194 --> 11:34.193
Well, we can start a tab
and, erm, settle up later.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.193
That's what I said.
And get him some food on me.

11:36.194 --> 11:38.033
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:38.034 --> 11:40.193
I'm sure we've got funds
for this sort of thing.

11:40.194 --> 11:41.194
Witness protection.

11:41.195 --> 11:43.193
Protection?
Why, am I in danger...?

11:43.194 --> 11:46.193
No. No.
I don't know why I said that.

11:46.194 --> 11:49.193
I'm a bit over-stimulated.

11:49.194 --> 11:52.193
Right, well, I'll pop back later
and see how you're getting on.

11:52.194 --> 11:54.959
- Well, let's get you settled, sir.
- Thank you.

11:55.394 --> 11:57.194
Shot shot?

12:03.194 --> 12:05.193
Martin, are you OK?

12:05.194 --> 12:06.713
I just heard what happened.

12:06.714 --> 12:08.193
What happened?
Where are you going?

12:08.194 --> 12:10.713
I heard there was a shooting.
Everyone's talking about it.

12:10.714 --> 12:12.193
Multiple injuries.

12:12.194 --> 12:15.193
One man was shot with a rifle.
It's a minor injury, though.

12:15.194 --> 12:18.193
Oh. Small-town gossip.
I should know better by now.

12:18.194 --> 12:20.193
I see Buddy's found his friend.
I'm just picking up James.

12:20.194 --> 12:22.194
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

12:24.194 --> 12:27.193
- What are you doing in the sun.
- I'm just having some chips.

12:27.194 --> 12:30.193
I told you, doxycycline leaves
your skin extra sensitive to sun,

12:30.194 --> 12:32.193
you could get a rash or severe burn.

12:32.194 --> 12:34.553
I think you're being
a bit over dramatic, Doc.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.393
Can't expect her to hide away
forever.

12:36.394 --> 12:37.713
Be quiet!

12:37.714 --> 12:39.193
Did you make
a follow-up appointment?

12:39.194 --> 12:41.033
Not yet, no.

12:41.034 --> 12:42.193
Come to the surgery
this afternoon.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.193
And keep out of the sun.
Honestly!

12:44.194 --> 12:46.371
- I don't know why I bother.
- Tosser!

12:50.194 --> 12:52.193
Oh... Go away.

12:52.194 --> 12:54.194
Go away.

13:01.234 --> 13:05.193
Someone's got a new friend.
Or a first friend, to be exact.

13:05.194 --> 13:07.193
Yeah. Who is that?
I don't recognise him.

13:07.194 --> 13:09.193
Oh, that'll be my son, Arthur.

13:09.194 --> 13:12.553
It seems our children
are somewhat simpatico.

13:12.554 --> 13:15.193
You should arrange a play date.
It'd be good for them.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.193
Yeah, yeah,
we should do that sometime.

13:17.194 --> 13:18.553
I'll host if you like.

13:18.554 --> 13:21.233
Bit creepy at your place.
With all those coffins.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.234
The children can play in them.
The open ones anyway!

13:25.194 --> 13:26.194
That was a joke.

13:26.195 --> 13:29.193
And the surgery wouldn't
be suitable, obviously,

13:29.194 --> 13:32.193
because of Martin's patients
and all their illnesses and things.

13:32.194 --> 13:33.194
You could have it here.

13:33.195 --> 13:36.193
Place is empty
after nursery finishes.

13:36.194 --> 13:38.193
Yeah, yeah, OK. Thanks, Mel.

13:38.194 --> 13:40.873
Great. Well, how about tomorrow?

13:40.874 --> 13:42.873
Erm, yeah.

13:42.874 --> 13:45.193
So, what time should I pick him up?

13:45.194 --> 13:47.233
The two of you
would be supervising the play date.

13:47.234 --> 13:50.194
- Obviously.
- Obviously. Yeah.

13:58.194 --> 13:59.194
Is it bad?

13:59.195 --> 14:03.193
You have photodermatitis, from your
antibiotic reacting in the sun.

14:03.194 --> 14:05.193
Just like I told you it would.
Imagine that!

14:05.194 --> 14:07.193
Well, Rose thought
it would dry out my spots.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.033
Rose isn't a doctor.

14:09.034 --> 14:11.193
I wasn't enjoying it anyway.
Sun was making my headache worse.

14:11.194 --> 14:13.193
Or it's those pills you gave me.

14:13.194 --> 14:15.193
It won't be the pills.
How long have you had the headaches?

14:15.194 --> 14:16.194
A couple of weeks.

14:16.195 --> 14:18.233
And I get like... fuzzy eyes.
Things are blurred.

14:18.234 --> 14:20.233
Why didn't you mention this before?
Take a seat.

14:20.234 --> 14:23.193
I was going to, but I didn't get
the chance. You ran out.

14:23.194 --> 14:24.194
Any other symptoms?

14:24.195 --> 14:28.033
Yeah, I get this, like,
water sound thing in my ear.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.193
It gets kind of loud, then quiet.

14:30.194 --> 14:32.193
Like, whoosh!

14:32.194 --> 14:35.193
Be quiet.

14:35.194 --> 14:38.193
There are signs of papilledema.
I want you to have a scan.

14:38.194 --> 14:41.033
You think I'm pregnant?

14:41.034 --> 14:42.193
- A brain scan.
- Oh...

14:42.194 --> 14:43.194
No, wait, that's worse!

14:43.195 --> 14:45.193
Papilledema is a swelling
of the optic nerve

14:45.194 --> 14:47.193
due to increased pressure
in the brain.

14:47.194 --> 14:49.193
- How bad is that?
- That's what the scan will tell us.

14:49.194 --> 14:51.193
Could be caused by
a number of things.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.194
Like a tumour?

14:52.195 --> 14:54.194
Er, yes, that is a possibility.

14:56.194 --> 14:58.193
You're saying
I might have a brain tumour.

14:58.194 --> 14:59.233
I'm saying it's a possibility.

14:59.234 --> 15:02.193
It could just as easily be
central retinal vein occlusion,

15:02.194 --> 15:04.233
or optic neuritis,
or diabetic papillopathy...

15:04.234 --> 15:06.193
Oh, God.

15:06.194 --> 15:08.193
I think I'm gonna be sick.

15:08.194 --> 15:09.553
Put your head between your knees.

15:09.554 --> 15:11.873
I'll try and get you
an appointment in the morning,

15:11.874 --> 15:13.193
then come and see me
in the afternoon.

15:13.194 --> 15:16.034
- All right.
- Good.

15:24.369 --> 15:26.233
Well, you scrub up well.

15:26.234 --> 15:28.193
I'd look better
if I hadn't been shot.

15:28.194 --> 15:31.193
Still, decent of that policeman
to bring a change of clothes.

15:31.194 --> 15:33.873
Not that I need charity.

15:33.874 --> 15:36.193
Ah, Mr Brook,
I'll, er, just get your food.

15:36.194 --> 15:38.193
Let me get you a drink.

15:38.194 --> 15:39.194
On the house.

15:39.195 --> 15:41.233
I don't want to trouble you.

15:41.234 --> 15:43.393
Oh, whisky, single malt.

15:43.394 --> 15:45.193
A double would hit the spot.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.873
At least there's something
to remember Portwenn by.

15:47.874 --> 15:50.193
That's very generous, Bert.
And unexpected.

15:50.194 --> 15:53.193
Now, the local pub
is the heart of the community.

15:53.194 --> 15:55.193
You're so right, Bert.

15:55.194 --> 15:57.193
Will you stop standing and gawping?
Go, shoo.

15:57.194 --> 15:59.193
Here.

15:59.194 --> 16:01.193
Here he is.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.193
The man who's gonna help break the
biggest case in Portwenn since...

16:04.194 --> 16:06.233
Well, since forever.

16:06.234 --> 16:10.873
Sausage and mash,
extra onion rings, double fried egg.

16:10.874 --> 16:13.757
Do you mind if I have a bite to eat
while we talk?

16:14.194 --> 16:18.233
So, this claim Dennis is making,
that you're stealing eggs.

16:18.234 --> 16:19.713
That's rubbish.

16:19.714 --> 16:22.193
I was only choosing
which ones to buy.

16:22.194 --> 16:25.193
Well, he says there are signs up
saying stay off his property.

16:25.194 --> 16:28.193
OK, well, say that I'm the kind
of man to steal eggs.

16:28.194 --> 16:30.193
That I woke up one day
and decided to be a thief.

16:30.194 --> 16:32.193
Would that justify my being shot?

16:32.194 --> 16:34.193
Well, no.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.193
But he says it was an accident.

16:36.194 --> 16:38.193
Bloody good shot for an accident.

16:38.194 --> 16:41.193
- So you say you're from Bristol.
- Uh-huh.

16:41.194 --> 16:42.393
And what do you do for a living?

16:42.394 --> 16:44.193
What does that matter?

16:44.194 --> 16:46.193
Well, it's background.
Always useful.

16:46.194 --> 16:48.193
Married? Kids?

16:48.194 --> 16:49.194
Just a wife.

16:49.195 --> 16:52.193
I work for an accountancy firm,
it's very stressful,

16:52.194 --> 16:56.193
and I decided to get away
on a camping trip.

16:56.194 --> 16:58.193
She didn't wanna come with you?

16:58.194 --> 17:01.193
No. She doesn't like the outdoors.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.606
Is that against the law?

17:05.714 --> 17:07.193
Are you all right?

17:07.194 --> 17:09.193
No, I'm in pain,
I'm in pain from being shot

17:09.194 --> 17:12.252
by the man you should be
interrogating instead of me.

17:13.194 --> 17:17.193
All I need from you is
an official statement tomorrow

17:17.194 --> 17:19.193
and I can bring him to justice.

17:19.194 --> 17:22.194
Don't worry, I'm all over it.

17:24.194 --> 17:25.194
You not enjoying that?

17:25.194 --> 17:28.194
No, no, it's, it's fine.

17:29.194 --> 17:32.194
Like a mouse,
she's always behind me.

17:33.194 --> 17:35.194
Now, will you shoo? Shoo!

17:36.194 --> 17:37.194
So sorry.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.193
I forgot to tell you, James has
got his first play date tomorrow,

17:53.194 --> 17:54.393
with Arthur.

17:54.394 --> 17:57.713
- Who's Arthur?
- You know, Julia's son.

17:57.714 --> 18:00.193
- Who's Julia?
- The undertaker.

18:00.194 --> 18:02.194
Oh, right.

18:03.194 --> 18:04.194
What is it?

18:04.195 --> 18:07.193
Erm, you didn't ovulate last month,

18:07.194 --> 18:09.193
and I've had your anti-Mullerian
hormone test back.

18:09.194 --> 18:12.193
It shows a diminished
ovarian reserve.

18:12.194 --> 18:15.193
What does that mean?
That I won't be able to conceive?

18:15.194 --> 18:18.193
No. Low reserve's not
an indicator of quality,

18:18.194 --> 18:20.193
but it is a sign of a declining
level of fertility.

18:20.194 --> 18:23.193
Do you know, I'm starting to feel
more like your patient,

18:23.194 --> 18:25.033
rather than your wife?

18:25.034 --> 18:27.193
And after I've lit all these candles
and everything.

18:27.194 --> 18:30.193
- Because?
- Well, you know...

18:30.194 --> 18:32.193
It's romantic.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.193
And just in case we're gonna...

18:34.194 --> 18:36.193
you know.

18:36.194 --> 18:39.193
Because, Martin,
it's the right time.

18:39.194 --> 18:41.033
It's not optimum time...

18:41.034 --> 18:42.393
Can we not use words like "optimum"?

18:42.394 --> 18:45.713
It makes this all feel
like some sort of experiment.

18:45.714 --> 18:47.553
But your fertility's
important to us.

18:47.554 --> 18:51.193
Yeah, so maybe we should go
and see a fertility specialist.

18:51.194 --> 18:52.194
They'll only tell you
the same as me.

18:52.195 --> 18:54.233
But I don't need to wake up
next to them, do I?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.873
And strange as it may seem to you...

18:56.874 --> 19:01.194
I'd rather not everything connected
to this was so clinical.

19:06.194 --> 19:08.193
I suppose a fresh pair of eyes
couldn't do...

19:08.194 --> 19:09.554
Yes, please don't talk.

19:17.439 --> 19:19.975
Just put the "sold" sign
on the banner.

19:19.977 --> 19:22.150
- What?
- It's sold?

19:22.152 --> 19:23.439
Well, subject to contract.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.945
Who to? We never even got
a chance to submit a bid.

19:26.947 --> 19:28.439
The buyer is confidential.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.438
You had the same chance
as everyone else.

19:31.439 --> 19:32.439
We've got a right to know.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.438
I am sorry, I am not at liberty
to reveal her name.

19:35.439 --> 19:38.557
She'll be coming by at 4pm today.
I'll catch you then.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.438
This is a disaster.
Right before the wedding as well!

19:42.439 --> 19:43.958
What are we gonna do?

19:43.959 --> 19:46.438
Remember your blood pressure, right.
Keep calm.

19:46.439 --> 19:48.438
Did you hear what she said?

19:48.439 --> 19:51.438
Yes, someone has bought the pub,
so we're finished.

19:51.439 --> 19:54.438
"I'm not at liberty to reveal
her name."

19:54.439 --> 19:55.849
"Her name."

19:55.851 --> 19:59.343
A woman's bought it.
And we all know who that is, right?

19:59.345 --> 20:01.345
Think about it.

20:20.439 --> 20:23.438
Mr Brook.
How are you feeling?

20:23.439 --> 20:26.438
I've been shot,
stranded in this village,

20:26.439 --> 20:27.798
and I've never felt so ill.

20:27.799 --> 20:30.438
I was only being polite.

20:30.439 --> 20:33.438
I'm sorry. I've had
a rather stressful 24 hours.

20:33.439 --> 20:36.439
I'll show you through to the doc.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.439
Right.

20:45.982 --> 20:48.141
That's good, yep,
that's healing well.

20:48.142 --> 20:49.781
I'll take out the drain.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.781
How's it been feeling?

20:51.782 --> 20:52.782
Erm, sore.

20:54.448 --> 20:57.248
- What about your abdominal pain?
- Worse.

20:58.302 --> 21:02.067
Do you ever feel that life is
punishing you, day in, and day out?

21:02.782 --> 21:05.981
No.
I'll give you an ultrasound scan.

21:05.982 --> 21:08.781
That won't tell us everything,
so I'll take some blood as well.

21:08.782 --> 21:11.781
- All right.
- Are you sure about this?

21:11.782 --> 21:14.781
Last time, she made it very clear
she didn't want to get involved.

21:14.782 --> 21:16.781
That was then, this is now.

21:16.782 --> 21:18.781
We need to be on the front foot.

21:18.782 --> 21:21.782
This is our future
we're talking about.

21:28.782 --> 21:31.781
I wasn't expecting company.

21:31.782 --> 21:33.900
I thought it best
we come to see you.

21:41.782 --> 21:45.461
- Now, see these small dark areas?
- Yes.

21:45.462 --> 21:46.781
These are diverticulae.

21:46.782 --> 21:49.781
They're little pouches that have
developed in your intestine.

21:49.782 --> 21:51.781
When they become inflamed,
it's called diverticulitis.

21:51.782 --> 21:53.781
Whatever it is, it's bloody painful.

21:53.782 --> 21:56.781
Oh, yeah, it would be.
Here clean yourself up.

21:56.782 --> 21:58.781
I'll prescribe an antibiotic.

21:58.782 --> 22:01.781
And when your intestines
had a chance to recover,

22:01.782 --> 22:02.782
you'll have to go on
a high-fibre diet

22:02.783 --> 22:04.781
to prevent the condition
reoccurring.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.781
The best thing you can do is just
go home and rest up for a while.

22:07.782 --> 22:09.781
Metronidazole and co-amoxiclav.

22:09.782 --> 22:11.781
Can I pick that up here?

22:11.782 --> 22:13.301
No. You have to get it
from the pharmacy.

22:13.302 --> 22:14.821
No alcohol at all
while you're taking those.

22:14.822 --> 22:16.781
Make an appointment
with the receptionist.

22:16.782 --> 22:18.781
Does that mean I have to stay
another night?

22:18.782 --> 22:21.781
Yes, of course you do. I have
to talk you through your results.

22:21.782 --> 22:22.782
Right...

22:27.782 --> 22:28.782
Right.

22:28.783 --> 22:30.781
Let's get you down the station
for that statement.

22:30.782 --> 22:33.781
Turns out I need to make another
appointment for tomorrow.

22:33.782 --> 22:36.781
Er, nine o'clock?

22:36.782 --> 22:38.782
Er, yes.

22:39.782 --> 22:42.781
Right, then, it'll all be over soon,

22:42.782 --> 22:44.141
and you can get
back to your normal life.

22:44.142 --> 22:45.622
Thank you.

22:51.782 --> 22:53.782
Oh, thanks.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.301
We just wanted to say thank you.

22:57.302 --> 22:58.781
I know you've not done it for us,

22:58.782 --> 23:00.781
but I can assure you

23:00.782 --> 23:04.781
that we will do everything
to help make it a success.

23:04.782 --> 23:06.461
Well, that's awfully nice of you,
Bert.

23:06.462 --> 23:09.698
But I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

23:10.782 --> 23:13.781
He thinks you've bought the pub.

23:13.782 --> 23:14.782
Well, I haven't.

23:14.783 --> 23:17.781
I think I'd have noticed.

23:17.782 --> 23:21.781
There's a confidentiality clause,
I suspect.

23:21.782 --> 23:24.781
- Not to worry.
- No, I really haven't.

23:24.782 --> 23:26.781
Are you sure?

23:26.782 --> 23:27.900
I give you my word.

23:34.782 --> 23:37.781
I don't have any money to pay
for these antibiotics.

23:37.782 --> 23:39.018
Can you lend me some?

23:40.782 --> 23:42.782
Er, there.

23:43.782 --> 23:45.781
- You can square up later.
- Thank you.

23:45.782 --> 23:48.782
- Let's get this done first.
- Yes.

23:56.782 --> 23:59.821
Statement of Robert Joshua Brook.

23:59.822 --> 24:02.781
The time is 11:43...

24:02.782 --> 24:04.781
11:44.

24:04.782 --> 24:09.781
Can you tell me where you were
on the morning of Tuesday the 26th,

24:09.782 --> 24:11.782
at approximately oh 900 hours?

24:13.462 --> 24:16.781
- I was trying to buy some eggs
from the farmer. - This man?

24:16.782 --> 24:18.781
For the tape,
I am showing Robert Joshua Brook

24:18.782 --> 24:20.781
a photo of Dennis James Thorpe.

24:20.782 --> 24:22.461
Yes.

24:22.462 --> 24:26.781
Er, he came out of his farmhouse
shouting at me,

24:26.782 --> 24:27.782
so I turned to get away,

24:27.783 --> 24:29.781
and then he shot me, in the leg.

24:29.782 --> 24:31.781
So, he shot you?

24:31.782 --> 24:33.781
Yes.
You know that he did.

24:33.782 --> 24:35.781
- And you weren't stealing the eggs?
- No, of course not.

24:35.782 --> 24:38.781
- And you think he deliberately
shot you? - Yes, I do.

24:38.782 --> 24:41.141
Great.
I mean... Not "great".

24:41.142 --> 24:43.821
Terrible.
But it's good for the case.

24:43.822 --> 24:46.781
Now I'll need some personal details.

24:46.782 --> 24:50.782
If you could fill in your
home address, and contact numbers.

24:52.622 --> 24:53.781
Probably go to court.

24:53.782 --> 24:55.841
You'll get a go in the witness box.

24:57.782 --> 25:00.781
I might have to get up
and make a statement myself.

25:00.782 --> 25:02.782
Might even make the papers.

25:06.782 --> 25:08.781
I would like to amend my statement.

25:08.782 --> 25:12.781
It is possible that the farmer
didn't mean it on purpose.

25:12.782 --> 25:15.781
No, that's not what you said.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.781
I was confused.

25:17.782 --> 25:20.621
I think he fired a warning shot.

25:20.622 --> 25:22.621
He said the weapon
accidentally discharged.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.781
Yes, that right.
Accidental discharge.

25:24.782 --> 25:28.782
I do not wish to press any charges
as a result.

25:30.782 --> 25:32.781
You're my star witness.

25:32.782 --> 25:35.781
In fact, you're my only witness.

25:35.782 --> 25:38.301
And if you are saying
it was an accident...

25:38.302 --> 25:40.781
Then my career-defining case

25:40.782 --> 25:43.981
now becomes confiscation
of a gun license.

25:43.982 --> 25:46.781
Well...
It's the truth.

25:46.782 --> 25:49.782
It's the truth that matters,
isn't it?

25:50.782 --> 25:52.622
I want those clothes back.

25:57.782 --> 25:58.782
Next patient, please.

25:58.783 --> 26:01.781
Emily Burnett,
but she's not here yet.

26:01.782 --> 26:03.781
Doc, you have to come and see her.

26:03.782 --> 26:05.781
She's totally freaking out.

26:05.782 --> 26:07.781
- Who are you?
- Rose Tingley.

26:07.782 --> 26:10.781
Some people call me Tingles,
but I don't really like it.

26:10.782 --> 26:11.782
- Why are you here?
- I'm Emily's housemate.

26:11.783 --> 26:13.821
She went for that scan this morning,

26:13.822 --> 26:16.781
and the hospital wouldn't tell her
anything about it,

26:16.782 --> 26:17.782
because she's probably dying,

26:17.783 --> 26:19.781
and now she's locked herself
in her room.

26:19.782 --> 26:21.141
She needs to come to the surgery.

26:21.142 --> 26:22.781
She won't, that's the problem.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.781
I've got her scan results.

26:24.782 --> 26:27.430
And you don't have a patient
for half an hour.

26:30.782 --> 26:33.141
All right, I'll go and see her.

26:33.142 --> 26:34.781
You OK, Bert?

26:34.782 --> 26:36.781
Well, apart from being homeless,

26:36.782 --> 26:37.821
The pub has been sold out
from under us.

26:37.822 --> 26:39.781
Oh, dear, that is a shame.

26:39.782 --> 26:41.781
Do you know who has bought it?

26:41.782 --> 26:43.781
- What, the pub?
- Yeah.

26:43.782 --> 26:45.141
Oh, I haven't heard a thing.

26:45.142 --> 26:48.781
Well, they say it's someone local.
A woman.

26:48.782 --> 26:52.141
- Might be Ruth.
- No, it's not Ruth.

26:52.142 --> 26:54.781
I'm sorry, I need to pick up
this prescription.

26:54.782 --> 26:57.781
Oh. You're the one that was shot.

26:57.782 --> 27:01.141
Most of us round here don't approve
of shooting strangers.

27:01.142 --> 27:02.781
Thank you.

27:02.782 --> 27:04.781
I'm afraid
I have to stay another night.

27:04.782 --> 27:06.781
- Doctor's orders.
- You're most welcome.

27:06.782 --> 27:09.781
- There we are.
- And these, please.

27:09.782 --> 27:13.781
Oh. 11.90, please.

27:13.782 --> 27:16.781
Oh. I only have £10.
I'll put this back.

27:16.782 --> 27:18.462
No, no, no.

27:19.782 --> 27:20.981
Let's call it ten, shall we?

27:20.982 --> 27:22.781
- Really?
- Hmm.

27:22.782 --> 27:24.782
After all you've been through.

27:26.302 --> 27:27.782
And that's for you.

27:28.782 --> 27:32.142
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

27:41.782 --> 27:42.782
Right, boys.

27:42.783 --> 27:45.621
You've got the whole place
to yourselves.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.781
Oh. Thanks for this, Mel.

27:47.782 --> 27:49.781
No problem.

27:49.782 --> 27:52.781
I think it could really help James
with his social skills.

27:52.782 --> 27:53.821
I'll get you some tea,

27:53.822 --> 27:56.782
and I've got some leftover cake
and bits.

27:58.782 --> 28:00.781
James' social skills are fine.

28:00.782 --> 28:02.781
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure they are.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.461
He's, er...

28:04.462 --> 28:06.782
He's just a bit selective,
that's all.

28:08.782 --> 28:10.781
Gemma?

28:10.782 --> 28:11.982
Emily!

28:13.782 --> 28:15.621
Emily?

28:15.622 --> 28:16.781
What?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.781
I have got your test results.

28:18.782 --> 28:20.621
Who is that?

28:20.622 --> 28:21.781
It's Dr Ellingham.
Can you open...?

28:21.782 --> 28:23.781
- It's the doc!
- I don't want to know!

28:23.782 --> 28:25.781
Your scan is normal.

28:25.782 --> 28:27.621
- What?
- It's normal.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.781
- Normal?
- Yes, normal.

28:30.782 --> 28:33.781
- Really?
- Yes.

28:33.782 --> 28:36.781
See? Told you that you were
worrying about nothing.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.781
Total drama queen.

28:38.782 --> 28:41.781
Well, the scan was normal, but that
doesn't explain the papilledema.

28:41.782 --> 28:44.781
- Unfortunately, you're going to have
a lumbar puncture. - What's that?

28:44.782 --> 28:46.821
It measures the pressure
of your cerebrospinal fluid.

28:46.822 --> 28:49.621
I'll refer you,
but there's about a week wait.

28:49.622 --> 28:50.781
- Oh, my God!
- What?

28:50.782 --> 28:53.781
They get this giant needle
and stab you in the spine.

28:53.782 --> 28:54.782
- What?!
- They don't.

28:54.783 --> 28:57.781
It's a very fine needle, it's
a completely painless procedure.

28:57.782 --> 28:59.821
Well, then can we not just do it now
and get it over with?

28:59.822 --> 29:02.141
No. It ought to be done
in a hospital.

29:02.142 --> 29:04.781
Oh, I just went!
Look, I cannot take this.

29:04.782 --> 29:05.782
I can't take it either.

29:05.783 --> 29:08.781
Please, Doc,
she's gonna be like this all week.

29:08.782 --> 29:10.781
Something's wrong with me,
I know it, I'm dying.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.781
There's not!
Doc, please do something.

29:12.782 --> 29:14.782
Shut up. Shut up!

29:15.782 --> 29:18.781
Come to my surgery.
I'll do it this afternoon.

29:18.782 --> 29:21.488
- I'll bring her up later, Doc.
- Four o'clock.

29:26.462 --> 29:28.782
I think I need another car!

29:33.782 --> 29:36.547
- Oh, would you like some cake?
- Oh, thank you.

29:40.782 --> 29:44.077
You know, I didn't speak at all
for the first four years.

29:45.302 --> 29:46.981
My parents sent me
to all kinds of doctors.

29:46.982 --> 29:49.781
But they couldn't find
anything wrong with me.

29:49.782 --> 29:51.781
What happened?

29:51.782 --> 29:53.781
One day I just asked for some milk.

29:53.782 --> 29:55.781
I suppose I didn't have
anything to say till then.

29:55.782 --> 29:58.301
Well, children develop
at different rates.

29:58.302 --> 30:00.781
I've been learning all about that
as part of my course.

30:00.782 --> 30:02.621
Is that why you're studying?

30:02.622 --> 30:04.781
Because James is...?

30:04.782 --> 30:05.782
James is what?

30:05.783 --> 30:08.781
Well, er, I feel a bit odd...

30:08.782 --> 30:10.301
Are you OK?

30:10.302 --> 30:11.781
I-I... I can't breathe.

30:11.782 --> 30:13.781
Mel!

30:13.782 --> 30:15.781
I just need you in here a minute!
Mel!

30:15.782 --> 30:17.781
My mouth's gone numb.

30:17.782 --> 30:19.781
- OK, have some water.
- Thanks.

30:19.782 --> 30:21.781
What's wrong with her?

30:21.782 --> 30:23.781
I don't know. I think it
might be an allergic reaction.

30:23.782 --> 30:25.781
- Do you have any allergies?
- Cats.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.781
Have you got an adrenaline pen?

30:27.782 --> 30:28.782
- No.
- We've got one.

30:28.783 --> 30:29.981
I'll get it.

30:29.982 --> 30:32.781
Sandra, can you take the boys
to play outside, please?

30:32.782 --> 30:34.781
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

30:34.782 --> 30:37.781
In through the nose.
Just breath nice and slowly.

30:37.782 --> 30:38.821
- My face is burning up.
- OK.

30:38.822 --> 30:40.781
Mel!

30:40.782 --> 30:42.142
Coming!

30:43.781 --> 30:45.141
- Give it here.
- I'll do it.

30:45.142 --> 30:47.142
Oh, my God!

30:49.782 --> 30:51.782
Get another one!

30:53.622 --> 30:55.782
I can't breathe.

30:58.782 --> 31:00.781
- Louisa.
- Hello.

31:00.782 --> 31:02.781
So, I told Mel to get
an adrenaline pen.

31:02.782 --> 31:04.781
Then Julia tried to grab it
and Mel stabbed me.

31:04.782 --> 31:06.781
She was obviously
trying to stab Julia,

31:06.782 --> 31:07.981
- but she stabbed me instead.
- What?

31:07.982 --> 31:10.781
And now Julia's swollen up
like a beetroot balloon,

31:10.782 --> 31:11.782
so you better get here fast,

31:11.783 --> 31:14.781
because she needs help,
and I feel a bit weird.

31:14.782 --> 31:15.782
- Where are you?
- Tots!

31:15.783 --> 31:17.960
You know. Portwenn Tots!
Please hurry!

31:21.782 --> 31:24.781
In through the nose,
out through the mouth,

31:24.782 --> 31:25.782
in through the nose...

31:25.783 --> 31:27.781
Out through the mouth.

31:27.782 --> 31:29.781
In through the nose,
out through the mouth...

31:29.782 --> 31:32.781
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

31:32.782 --> 31:35.301
- Have you had
an adrenaline injection? - Yes.

31:35.302 --> 31:36.781
Oh, you mean her? Yes!
Her too.

31:36.782 --> 31:38.312
Help her get her coat off.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.781
Sandra has taken the boys
out to play.

31:40.782 --> 31:42.781
I feel like I'm talking a lot.
Am I?

31:42.782 --> 31:43.841
Er, a little, yes.

31:45.782 --> 31:47.781
I'll give you another shot
of adrenalin.

31:47.782 --> 31:50.141
Looks like you've had
a severe allergic reaction,

31:50.142 --> 31:52.141
and your breathing
hasn't recovered yet.

31:52.142 --> 31:54.781
Definitely not feeling right at all,
no.

31:54.782 --> 31:57.077
That's the effect
of the adrenaline pen.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.521
Martin, do you like being a doctor?

32:04.622 --> 32:05.781
Yes...

32:05.782 --> 32:07.781
All you have to do to keep your job
is to be nice and polite

32:07.782 --> 32:09.781
to these people
that they send to test you,

32:09.782 --> 32:11.781
but you just can't seem to do it,
can you?

32:11.782 --> 32:13.781
And I know we talk about how James
needs to learn to socialise,

32:13.782 --> 32:16.301
but the apple doesn't fall
that far from the tree, does it?

32:16.302 --> 32:18.781
Louisa, try and calm down,
you're winding yourself up.

32:18.782 --> 32:21.621
Here, breathe in deeply
into the paper bag.

32:21.622 --> 32:23.781
Get some carbon dioxide
back into your bloodstream.

32:23.782 --> 32:25.782
Yeah, I'll be fine.

32:28.782 --> 32:30.781
But what are we thinking?
Trying for another child now.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.781
We could both could be unemployed
in a year!

32:32.782 --> 32:35.781
- Are you gonna lose your job?
- What are you allergic to?

32:35.782 --> 32:38.621
Cats. And she didn't speak
until she was four.

32:38.622 --> 32:40.781
- Keep breathing into the bag.
- I have hay fever.

32:40.782 --> 32:42.781
And what have you eaten today?

32:42.782 --> 32:44.781
Just homemade soup.
Oh, and cake.

32:44.782 --> 32:46.781
- Cake?
- Cake.

32:46.782 --> 32:48.781
No, not cake, banana bread.

32:48.782 --> 32:49.782
That horrible sweaty cake

32:49.783 --> 32:51.781
which has been left out in the sun
for too long.

32:51.782 --> 32:53.781
I'm talking a lot,
but I can't seem to stop myself.

32:53.782 --> 32:55.782
Just keep breathing into the bag.

33:05.782 --> 33:07.781
No way. You bought it?!

33:07.782 --> 33:10.781
- Dad.
- Caitlin?

33:10.782 --> 33:12.781
Seemed like a good investment.

33:12.782 --> 33:17.781
Now, are you absolutely sure
that it is was her, and not Ruth?

33:17.782 --> 33:19.781
Definitely Caitlin, yes, yes.

33:19.782 --> 33:21.781
I've still got the shop to run,

33:21.782 --> 33:26.781
so all that will be different is
the licensee's name over the door.

33:26.782 --> 33:27.782
You can stay on as manager.

33:27.783 --> 33:30.781
And as for you, Bert...

33:30.782 --> 33:34.781
It's just possible that I may have
been a bit sharp with you

33:34.782 --> 33:37.781
on a few occasions recently,

33:37.782 --> 33:40.981
but it's only because I've been
very focused on the job.

33:40.982 --> 33:44.781
I was about to say you can
continue as assistant manager.

33:44.782 --> 33:47.781
Who knows, there may be a wage hike.

33:47.782 --> 33:49.781
If we get all the books in order,

33:49.782 --> 33:53.781
and make sure we're all focused
on the business side of things.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.302
Hmm. Yep.

33:57.782 --> 34:00.781
Have you ever had any other
allergic reactions before?

34:00.782 --> 34:01.782
Er...

34:01.783 --> 34:05.301
Rubber gloves used to bring me out
in a rash, so I stopped using them.

34:05.302 --> 34:07.781
I use nitrile gloves
for my work now.

34:07.782 --> 34:10.781
Hmm, well, a latex allergy
would fit with your reaction.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.621
I didn't eat any gloves!

34:13.621 --> 34:15.781
No, but there were bananas
in the cake that you ate yesterday

34:15.782 --> 34:17.781
and latex and bananas
have similar proteins.

34:17.782 --> 34:20.781
Oh, I wouldn't have made
that connection.

34:20.782 --> 34:24.301
- Do you think I could be atopic?
- It's quite possible.

34:24.302 --> 34:26.781
Er, you'll have triggers
that would increase the reactions.

34:26.782 --> 34:28.781
- Such as?
- Stress is a common one.

34:28.782 --> 34:31.781
Oh, I'm not that stressed.

34:31.782 --> 34:32.782
Although...

34:32.783 --> 34:35.781
I have just been through a
protracted and rather messy divorce

34:35.782 --> 34:38.781
and moved to a new village,
and a new house,

34:38.782 --> 34:40.301
and taken over the family business,

34:40.302 --> 34:41.781
with a small child in tow...

34:41.782 --> 34:44.621
Oh, funny how things sound worse

34:44.621 --> 34:47.460
when you say them out loud,
isn't it?

34:47.462 --> 34:49.781
I'll write you a prescription
for an antihistamine,

34:49.782 --> 34:50.782
but I want you to come back
in a week

34:50.783 --> 34:52.781
for a full allergy screening test.

34:52.782 --> 34:54.781
You must stop taking
the antihistamine

34:54.782 --> 34:57.781
three days before I do the test
so that I get clear results.

34:57.782 --> 34:58.782
Is that understood?

34:58.783 --> 35:00.782
Thank you, Doctor Ellingham.

35:02.782 --> 35:05.141
- So, can I put you on my list?
- What list?

35:05.142 --> 35:06.461
List of two GPs I need

35:06.462 --> 35:08.781
to fill in the Crematorium Forms
for the deceased.

35:08.782 --> 35:10.781
You used to do it for my uncle?

35:10.782 --> 35:13.782
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- He was a terrible bore.

35:14.782 --> 35:16.781
Did either of your parents
practice medicine?

35:16.782 --> 35:19.781
My father was a surgeon.
Is that relevant?

35:19.782 --> 35:21.781
I just think it's fascinating,

35:21.782 --> 35:23.781
how we all follow in the tradition
of our families.

35:23.782 --> 35:25.781
You're healing the sick,

35:25.782 --> 35:28.782
and I'm making sure
they're disposed of correctly.

35:29.782 --> 35:33.781
Sorry, I've spent too much time
with my small child and a dog,

35:33.782 --> 35:37.981
I think I'm starved
of intelligent adult conversation.

35:37.982 --> 35:40.781
Well, thank you for this,
Doctor Ellingham.

35:40.782 --> 35:41.782
You're welcome.

35:51.168 --> 35:54.127
The anaesthetic
should have taken effect now.

35:54.128 --> 35:55.487
Can you feel that?

35:55.488 --> 35:57.127
No.

35:57.128 --> 35:59.128
Squeeze my hand.

36:04.128 --> 36:05.327
Tell me when it's going in.

36:05.328 --> 36:07.128
Just try to relax.

36:10.128 --> 36:12.127
- Tell me when.
- Keep still.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.327
I am still.
Just don't do it until I'm ready.

36:15.328 --> 36:17.128
It's OK, Em.

36:24.128 --> 36:26.967
- All done.
- What?

36:26.968 --> 36:29.733
Lie there, keep completely still
for 45 minutes.

36:30.128 --> 36:31.967
You got WiFi here?

36:31.968 --> 36:33.127
- Yes.
- So...

36:33.128 --> 36:34.967
Password?

36:34.968 --> 36:37.127
- It's not for patients.
- That's not fair!

36:37.128 --> 36:40.128
You can't expect us
just to sit here and do nothing.

36:41.128 --> 36:43.128
Read that.

36:58.128 --> 36:59.328
Come in.

37:01.808 --> 37:04.127
- Your food.
- Oh, thank you.

37:04.128 --> 37:05.128
Are you OK?

37:06.968 --> 37:11.127
I still have a sore stomach,
but the doctor gave me antibiotics.

37:11.128 --> 37:12.128
I'm sure it'll shift soon.

37:12.129 --> 37:15.127
Let me know if you need anything.

37:15.128 --> 37:17.127
Is that the bill?

37:17.128 --> 37:19.127
So far, yeah.

37:19.128 --> 37:20.128
Yeah, we're under new management,

37:20.129 --> 37:23.127
so we're keen to settle
any outstanding debts ASAP.

37:23.128 --> 37:24.167
I have a doctor's appointment
tomorrow,

37:24.168 --> 37:27.127
and the policeman is taking me up to
the campsite and I'll get my wallet.

37:27.128 --> 37:30.128
Oh, great.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

38:02.128 --> 38:05.127
- Al, can you get Mr Brook for me?
- You're too late.

38:05.128 --> 38:07.127
I checked his room earlier.
But he's not here.

38:07.128 --> 38:09.127
He must have gone to the doc,
he looked terrible last night.

38:09.128 --> 38:11.127
Oh. I said I'd take him.

38:11.128 --> 38:13.599
Well, guess he decided
to get a head start.

38:18.328 --> 38:20.487
Oh, Doc, I did it!

38:20.488 --> 38:22.127
Got the letter this morning.

38:22.128 --> 38:25.327
You are looking at a fully-qualified
first responder.

38:25.328 --> 38:28.127
- Congratulations.
- Do I get a title?

38:28.128 --> 38:29.128
Like doctor.

38:29.129 --> 38:32.127
I mean, not doctor,
but you know... something else.

38:32.128 --> 38:34.127
- No.
- Oh.

38:34.128 --> 38:36.187
Well, at least I got a certificate.

38:37.129 --> 38:39.127
Portwenn Surgery.

38:39.128 --> 38:42.127
Here to pick up Robert Brook.

38:42.128 --> 38:44.127
He's not here.

38:44.128 --> 38:46.127
Erm, Doc, it's the lab for you.

38:46.128 --> 38:48.127
Ellingham.

38:48.128 --> 38:50.127
- So, has he been and gone already?
- He hasn't been here.

38:50.128 --> 38:52.127
That's a complete waste of my time.

38:52.128 --> 38:54.327
We need to find Mr Brook.

38:54.328 --> 38:57.127
Why?
Does he owe you money too?

38:57.128 --> 38:59.127
No, his inflammatory markers
are high.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.128
It's very likely that he has sepsis.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.327
We need to get him
to a hospital as soon as possible.

39:02.328 --> 39:05.127
Didn't he say he was staying at some
campsite. Which one?

39:05.128 --> 39:07.305
Dennis Thorpe will know.
Come on, Doc.

39:28.128 --> 39:30.127
What do you want now?

39:30.128 --> 39:32.127
Do you know where Mr Brook
is camping?

39:32.128 --> 39:34.127
I'm sick of you people hassling me.

39:34.128 --> 39:36.127
He's extremely ill.
We need to find him.

39:36.128 --> 39:38.127
He's a bloody thief,
that's what he is.

39:38.128 --> 39:39.327
Doc, allow me.

39:39.328 --> 39:41.327
Dennis, we need to find him now

39:41.328 --> 39:44.127
or there is a very good chance
he might die,

39:44.128 --> 39:47.127
which means you'd be looking
at a manslaughter charge.

39:47.128 --> 39:49.128
So...?

39:52.168 --> 39:56.127
If it were me,
I'd camp at Burly Woods,

39:56.128 --> 39:58.127
there's water and shelter there.

39:58.128 --> 40:00.128
Oh, come on!

40:04.128 --> 40:05.128
Robert!

40:08.128 --> 40:10.128
Robert!

40:12.128 --> 40:13.128
Over here.

40:25.808 --> 40:27.128
Oh, good grief.

40:33.128 --> 40:36.967
Is this your campsite?
It's a dump.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.127
What are you doing here?

40:39.128 --> 40:41.967
I need to get you
into intensive care.

40:41.968 --> 40:43.127
I think you have sepsis.

40:43.128 --> 40:44.128
Penhale. Get the Land Rover,

40:44.129 --> 40:46.127
bring it as close
as you possibly can.

40:46.128 --> 40:50.647
If it's left untreated, it can lead
to multiple organ failure and death.

40:50.648 --> 40:53.127
- Is that cos I shot him?
- Yes.

40:53.128 --> 40:54.967
No. It's a severe abdominal
infection.

40:54.968 --> 40:57.647
He's left it way too late
to get it treated.

40:57.648 --> 41:00.127
It doesn't matter,
I don't want to go on.

41:00.128 --> 41:01.128
Oh, for God sake, shut up!

41:01.129 --> 41:04.127
I'll give you a stronger antibiotic.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.127
How long you been living here?

41:06.128 --> 41:07.128
Couple of months.

41:09.128 --> 41:10.647
I lost my job not so long ago,

41:10.648 --> 41:12.967
and my marriage wasn't working out.

41:12.968 --> 41:15.807
And then, I don't know...

41:15.808 --> 41:18.279
Debts, bills,
I couldn't afford the rent...

41:19.168 --> 41:23.127
Aye, I know what it's like
to have nothing.

41:23.128 --> 41:25.128
Oh, for God's sake. Hold this.

41:27.128 --> 41:29.128
Right, help me get him up.

41:38.648 --> 41:40.128
- You got him?
- Yep.

41:41.328 --> 41:43.127
The eggs...

41:43.128 --> 41:45.127
You were gonna buy them.

41:45.128 --> 41:46.128
I know.

41:46.129 --> 41:47.968
Right, come on.

41:52.968 --> 41:56.127
Is there really absolutely nobody
you can turn to.

41:56.128 --> 41:58.127
No, not really.

41:58.128 --> 42:00.305
Sometimes it's easier
just to give up.

42:01.128 --> 42:02.128
That's cheery...

42:02.129 --> 42:05.127
I'm not gonna be able to settle up
at the pub.

42:05.128 --> 42:06.327
Or pay you back.

42:06.328 --> 42:08.167
It's gonna take some time.
I'm sorry.

42:08.168 --> 42:10.647
Don't worry.
We'll sort something out.

42:10.648 --> 42:14.127
And you can still testify
against you-know-who.

42:14.128 --> 42:15.128
No.

42:16.128 --> 42:17.167
I was never going to.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.128
Oh...

42:26.968 --> 42:30.127
I er, I had a thought.

42:30.128 --> 42:34.327
If you need a place for a few weeks,
get back on your feet, like...

42:34.328 --> 42:37.127
I've got a spare room.

42:37.128 --> 42:41.127
Providing you don't talk much,
and stay out of my way.

42:41.128 --> 42:43.127
No, no,
you're trying to influence him.

42:43.128 --> 42:44.967
That's witness tampering.

42:44.968 --> 42:47.127
It sounds like a good solution
to me,

42:47.128 --> 42:48.487
if the room is clean and hygienic.

42:48.488 --> 42:50.488
My house is very hygienic!

42:52.128 --> 42:55.128
Although I could give it
a quick wash and tidy up.

42:56.648 --> 42:58.968
Well, I've never been
one for charity...

43:00.128 --> 43:01.128
Thank you.

43:06.128 --> 43:08.127
So, you have idiopathic
intracranial hypertension.

43:08.128 --> 43:10.127
It's a build-up of pressure
around the brain.

43:10.128 --> 43:12.127
Oh, my God!

43:12.128 --> 43:13.128
Calm down.

43:13.129 --> 43:15.127
How can I calm down?
I have pressure on my brain.

43:15.128 --> 43:17.127
- Is it gonna explode?
- No. And that's not helpful.

43:17.128 --> 43:18.487
It can be treated.

43:18.488 --> 43:21.127
I'll put you on acetazolamide
to bring the swelling down,

43:21.128 --> 43:23.127
and you can keep taking
your acne medication with this.

43:23.128 --> 43:26.127
But long term, I think we need
to talk about your diet.

43:26.128 --> 43:29.127
Doc, are you body shaming her?
Cos that is so not on.

43:29.128 --> 43:30.807
Maybe let him finish?

43:30.808 --> 43:32.127
Only looking out for you.

43:32.128 --> 43:34.127
I know, but he probably just
wants me to cut down

43:34.128 --> 43:35.128
on my fat and salt intake?

43:35.128 --> 43:36.128
Yes, that's correct.

43:36.129 --> 43:38.327
And keep a record of your headaches
and how severe they are.

43:38.328 --> 43:40.127
And come back and see me in a month.

43:40.128 --> 43:42.127
Can I start wearing make-up again?

43:42.128 --> 43:44.127
- No.
- Aw.

43:44.128 --> 43:46.127
Well, thanks, Doc.

43:46.128 --> 43:48.128
That's for you.

43:58.128 --> 43:59.327
Oh, what are you cooking?

43:59.328 --> 44:02.127
- Trout.
- Do you want some help?

44:02.128 --> 44:04.127
No, I know how to fillet a fish,
Martin.

44:04.128 --> 44:06.127
Yes.

44:06.128 --> 44:09.127
I've been looking up
some fertility specialists.

44:09.128 --> 44:11.127
Erm, it's quite a broad field.

44:11.128 --> 44:14.967
I've provisionally made us an
appointment with one,

44:14.968 --> 44:16.127
a Dr Emma Ryder.

44:16.128 --> 44:17.128
Oh, good. Thank you.

44:17.129 --> 44:19.648
She's highly qualified, published.

44:20.808 --> 44:24.167
Use the flat of the knife against
the fish's backbone to guide it.

44:24.168 --> 44:26.128
I know.

44:31.128 --> 44:34.127
- It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?
- Yeah, well...

44:34.128 --> 44:37.967
It's probably the adrenaline
from my accident, Martin.

44:37.968 --> 44:41.127
No.
It would have worn off by now.

44:41.128 --> 44:43.128
Fine. Well, you finish it.

44:46.128 --> 44:48.127
Do you have a spare fish?

44:48.128 --> 44:50.128
Yeah...

44:56.128 --> 44:58.967
We mustn't let the GMC fire you.

44:58.968 --> 45:01.127
Why, are they going to fire me?

45:01.128 --> 45:03.127
No firm decision has been made yet.

45:03.128 --> 45:05.127
But I'd say the prognosis
isn't good.

45:05.128 --> 45:06.128
Louisa, I hope your patients

45:06.129 --> 45:09.127
aren't going to obstruct
the business of the surgery.

45:09.128 --> 45:11.808
We call them clients, not patients.

45:13.128 --> 45:15.127
Let me take you out on the waves.

45:15.128 --> 45:17.487
Work off some of that tension.

45:17.488 --> 45:19.127
You've got a heart of gold, Doc.
