<font color="#ffffff"> <i>Warehouse 13...</i> </font>

00:03.153 --> 00:05.687
It wasn't the marriage that
I was trying to keep secret.

00:05.721 --> 00:06.955
It was me...

00:06.990 --> 00:09.958
the guy I was before,
you know, Pete the drunk.

00:09.993 --> 00:12.724
You've never met that guy,
and I don't ever want you to.

00:12.803 --> 00:15.388
Charlotte Dupres, who, as it
turns out, is a rival of mine.

00:15.422 --> 00:17.139
If I blow your heart
out of your chest,

00:17.173 --> 00:18.510
you think that'll stop you?

00:18.545 --> 00:22.451
My lying, cheating husband
is once again out in the world.

00:22.485 --> 00:26.491
But I have plans too.

00:33.104 --> 00:34.788
Good morning, Mrs. LaBelle.

00:34.789 --> 00:37.725
Hi, Terry.

00:41.263 --> 00:42.897
Oh, my God.

00:45.900 --> 00:46.967
Help me.

00:47.001 --> 00:49.403
I'm burning up.

00:51.709 --> 00:53.344
His name was Terry Chambers,

00:53.378 --> 00:55.243
district attorney
in Marlon, Ohio...

00:55.452 --> 00:57.586
poisoned out of nowhere
in his driveway this morning.

00:57.621 --> 00:58.921
Arsenic in his coffee?

00:58.955 --> 01:00.822
No, he hadn't eaten
anything in eight hours,

01:00.856 --> 01:02.157
and there were
no visible track marks.

01:02.191 --> 01:03.691
Cause of death...

01:03.726 --> 01:06.094
muscle paralysis
and lungs collapsed

01:06.129 --> 01:07.363
and heart attack.

01:07.397 --> 01:08.966
That's why I'm sending
you and Pete.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.300
Where is Pete, by the way?

01:10.335 --> 01:13.205
He's at his yearly physical.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.042
Oh, God, no.
Is it time for those?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.477
Yeah, wait till you hit
over 50,

01:17.511 --> 01:19.046
and the real fun begins.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.214
What is that?

01:20.248 --> 01:21.449
Oh, this is
the last of the stuff

01:21.483 --> 01:22.683
that I had at my mom's.

01:22.718 --> 01:24.352
Yeah, she needed the space.

01:24.386 --> 01:25.954
You got a flight
in an hour, so...

01:25.988 --> 01:27.123
Right.
I'm on my way.

01:27.157 --> 01:30.494
Hey, Steve, do you smell...?

01:30.528 --> 01:32.730
Yes, I do.

01:32.764 --> 01:36.402
Mmm, you know, uh, Abigail,

01:36.436 --> 01:39.239
it is
spectacularly nice of you,

01:39.273 --> 01:41.075
but you didn't have to go
through the trouble

01:41.109 --> 01:42.943
- to bake us scones.
- Bake you scones?

01:42.978 --> 01:44.412
Oh, no, this is my breakfast.

01:44.446 --> 01:46.581
Yeah, they're from that cute
little bakery over on 3rd.

01:46.615 --> 01:47.883
- Oh.
- Okay.

01:47.917 --> 01:49.818
Yeah, yeah, whenever Pete
talks about that place,

01:49.853 --> 01:50.820
he gets a little...

01:50.854 --> 01:52.221
- Drool.
- Right here, yeah.

01:52.256 --> 01:54.591
Yeah, but if somebody
wanted to do the dishes,

01:54.625 --> 01:56.526
I would consider
sharing one of my scones.

01:56.561 --> 01:58.595
- Ooh, uh...
- Did somebody say "scones"?

01:58.630 --> 02:00.330
Actually, you don't have time
for breakfast,

02:00.365 --> 02:02.365
because you and Steve...
you've got a ping of your own.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.434
- I was kind of hoping I could...
- A 15-year-old boy

02:04.469 --> 02:06.270
went into some kind
of fugue state

02:06.304 --> 02:07.639
in a park in New York City,

02:07.673 --> 02:11.209
and he graffitied some seriously
advanced math on the wall.

02:11.244 --> 02:12.678
Ooh, that sounds fascinating.

02:12.712 --> 02:13.679
- Mm.
- It does?

02:13.713 --> 02:15.548
Yeah, don't you think?

02:15.582 --> 02:17.250
Okay, I'm officially jaded.

02:17.284 --> 02:19.052
Really?
Because Abigail and I...

02:19.087 --> 02:21.054
we were gonna flush out
the neutralizer annex,

02:21.089 --> 02:23.257
but if you would really
rather stay...

02:23.291 --> 02:25.393
Nope, thank you.
Loving the fugue.

02:25.427 --> 02:26.728
- Come along, Jinksy.
- I'll stay.

02:26.762 --> 02:28.564
- You'll what now?
- You're gonna stay?

02:28.598 --> 02:30.466
Yeah, I would love
to just unpack all that junk.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.901
Yeah, but wouldn't you
rather do that

02:31.935 --> 02:33.603
after they flush out
the neutralizer?

02:33.637 --> 02:34.905
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

02:34.939 --> 02:37.340
I've hogged all the neutralizer
fun for 30 years.

02:37.375 --> 02:38.842
If Steve would rather stay,

02:38.877 --> 02:40.278
- we should let him stay.
- Might as well.

02:40.312 --> 02:43.248
Yes, and I could use a little
bit of action in the field.

02:43.282 --> 02:45.784
And I think you and I rather hit
our stride

02:45.819 --> 02:48.054
chasing Beethoven's bust,
so shall we?

02:48.088 --> 02:49.856
All right, Bilbo Baggins,
you're on.

02:49.890 --> 02:51.257
- Let's go.
- I have to pack, though.

02:51.291 --> 02:54.293
Oh, you go...
and I'll go... yeah.

02:58.866 --> 03:00.333
Okay, what are you doing?

03:00.368 --> 03:01.969
Nothing.

03:02.003 --> 03:03.937
Grip strength
is the first muscle to go.

03:03.972 --> 03:06.173
Well, I know how important
that is to you.

03:06.207 --> 03:07.641
Can I help you?

03:07.675 --> 03:10.211
Yeah, we're looking
for Terry Chambers' house.

03:10.246 --> 03:11.613
Ooh, Secret Service, huh?

03:11.647 --> 03:13.782
I recognize that badge
from the website.

03:13.816 --> 03:17.620
Are you here
about the DA's death?

03:17.654 --> 03:21.057
Uh, Hummingbird Lane,
you make a left...

03:21.091 --> 03:22.825
2141, okay?

03:22.860 --> 03:25.328
I'm here for backup.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.272 --> 03:38.842
Jeez, this place
looks like a '50s TV show.

03:46.752 --> 03:47.886
What?

03:47.920 --> 03:51.390
I have to do the other side.

03:53.193 --> 03:54.760
You can't park here, mister.

03:54.794 --> 03:57.396
Visitors park
in visitor parking.

03:57.431 --> 03:59.031
Secret Service.

03:59.066 --> 04:02.202
I don't care if you've got
the potus in the back seat.

04:02.236 --> 04:04.872
I'm Colonel Arnold Cassel,
president of the board here.

04:04.906 --> 04:06.106
I'll have you towed.

04:06.141 --> 04:07.908
Okay, you want to go?

04:07.943 --> 04:10.211
Okay, wait, wait!
No, you're staying inside.

04:10.245 --> 04:11.679
It's okay, sir.

04:11.713 --> 04:15.049
We will move.
We'll move.

04:15.083 --> 04:17.017
Rules are rules, soldier.

04:17.052 --> 04:19.820
It's a slippery road to hell
once you start breaking 'em.

04:23.292 --> 04:24.525
Gated communities...

04:24.560 --> 04:27.962
for when you really miss
boot camp.

04:27.997 --> 04:31.333
A guy is dead, and all they
care about are parking rules.

04:31.367 --> 04:34.670
- Talk about twisted priorities!
- Okay, what is going on?

04:34.704 --> 04:36.204
First your hand-exercise thing,

04:36.239 --> 04:39.808
and now... then you yell
at an old guy?

04:39.843 --> 04:41.710
Oh, my God, you had
your physical this morning.

04:41.745 --> 04:42.711
Is everything okay?

04:42.746 --> 04:44.647
Yeah. No. No. Nothing.
No... no news.

04:44.682 --> 04:47.717
Then why... why are you
speeding up?

04:47.752 --> 04:49.686
Okay, Mykes...

04:49.720 --> 04:54.388
The doctor may have said that my
testosterone was a little low.

04:54.423 --> 04:57.959
Oh, well, that means...

04:57.993 --> 05:00.328
Well, you know, he... he said
it was no big deal.

05:00.362 --> 05:03.197
- Oh.
- You know?

05:03.232 --> 05:06.167
But then I read online
that it could cause infertility,

05:06.202 --> 05:08.202
loss of sex drive and...

05:08.237 --> 05:09.304
ED.

05:09.338 --> 05:11.473
- Hi, there.
- Hey.

05:11.507 --> 05:13.074
Janice Malloy...

05:13.108 --> 05:14.942
26, right over there.

05:14.977 --> 05:16.444
- There it is.
- Yep.

05:16.478 --> 05:18.312
And you are?

05:18.347 --> 05:20.515
I'm Agent Bering.
This is Agent Lattimer.

05:20.549 --> 05:23.017
- We're with the Secret Service.
- Agents... I knew it.

05:23.051 --> 05:25.719
Are you guys here
to investigate

05:25.754 --> 05:28.421
DA Chambers' death?

05:28.456 --> 05:29.589
Think it was murder?

05:29.623 --> 05:30.790
Why?
Do you think it was murder?

05:30.825 --> 05:32.425
I certainly hope not,

05:32.460 --> 05:35.228
but with what happened
a few nights ago...

05:35.262 --> 05:37.530
- To the DA?
- You haven't heard?

05:37.564 --> 05:41.267
The DA forgot to park his car
in his garage,

05:41.301 --> 05:43.235
and somebody
broke his windshield.

05:44.771 --> 05:48.373
Nobody saw who,
but we all saw the windshield.

05:48.408 --> 05:50.375
Anyhoo, I must dash.

05:50.410 --> 05:51.610
Good luck to you.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.045
26, right over there,

05:53.079 --> 05:55.347
if I can help you in any way.

05:55.381 --> 05:58.083
- Toodles.
- Eh.

05:58.117 --> 05:59.585
Toodles.

05:59.619 --> 06:01.420
Thank you, Gladys Kravitz.

06:05.659 --> 06:08.995
Do you think that I really
need to wear...

06:09.029 --> 06:11.597
Oh, uh, that's a bit much,
don't you think?

06:11.632 --> 06:12.865
Ooh, no, after what happened

06:12.899 --> 06:14.333
when the Warehouse
was trying to grow,

06:14.368 --> 06:16.402
I am not taking any chances.

06:16.437 --> 06:17.904
Suit yourself.

06:17.938 --> 06:19.505
Pun intended.

06:39.292 --> 06:41.526
- Oh!
- Ugh.

06:41.561 --> 06:43.563
Okay, something here is dead.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.461
<font color="#ff0000">What Matters</font> <font color="#ffffff">Most</font>

07:03.293 --> 07:04.416
So...

07:04.451 --> 07:06.585
A 15-year-old boy?

07:06.620 --> 07:08.587
Yeah.
Nick Powell.

07:08.621 --> 07:10.923
He did all of this in a trance?

07:10.957 --> 07:12.991
Yeah, and according
to two witnesses,

07:13.026 --> 07:14.593
radiating some kind of light.

07:14.627 --> 07:16.361
So when do we meet Nick?

07:16.396 --> 07:18.030
You know, the... huh?
Oh, in about an hour.

07:18.064 --> 07:19.531
Nurse said he's getting an MRI.

07:19.566 --> 07:21.566
I just... I see
algorithmic physics.

07:21.601 --> 07:22.868
I see differential calculus.

07:22.902 --> 07:24.135
There's code on the other side.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.004
It looks like C++ or Java.

07:26.038 --> 07:28.273
Well, maybe we should go to
his home, talk to his parents?

07:28.308 --> 07:32.311
Nick's got no parents
or a home.

07:32.345 --> 07:34.146
He lives over there.

07:34.181 --> 07:36.249
Nice box.

07:36.283 --> 07:39.452
I used to have one like that.

07:39.486 --> 07:41.587
Lost the lease.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.426
So, Rodger,
do you know if your stepdad

07:47.461 --> 07:50.162
brought home anything old
or antique-y lately?

07:50.196 --> 07:53.299
Well, it's Rodge,
and... and I don't know.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.767
Uh, my mom might.
She should be home soon.

07:55.802 --> 07:57.069
What about his windshield?

07:57.103 --> 07:58.771
We heard somebody broke it
a few nights ago.

07:58.805 --> 08:01.173
Okay, well, you know what?
It wasn't me.

08:01.207 --> 08:03.175
I wasn't even here.

08:03.209 --> 08:07.412
Are you guys... are you guys
really Secret Service?

08:07.447 --> 08:10.415
- Look, Rodger...
- Rodge.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.917
- Rodge.
- Mm-hmm.

08:11.951 --> 08:14.753
Uh, did your stepdad
receive any threats lately?

08:14.787 --> 08:18.022
Wait. What?
Threats?

08:18.057 --> 08:21.693
Well, he sent 6 men
to death row in 15 years.

08:21.728 --> 08:24.463
I mean, surely someone nicknamed
"DA Gas Chambers"

08:24.497 --> 08:25.797
must have made some enemies.

08:25.832 --> 08:29.634
Wait. Are you guys saying
that Terry was murdered?

08:29.668 --> 08:31.836
Because I just thought
he had a stroke.

08:31.870 --> 08:33.371
We're just covering our angles.

08:33.405 --> 08:36.274
Dude, that is... that's...
that's messed up.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.842
Um...

08:37.876 --> 08:40.144
I-I don't know
anything about his work.

08:40.178 --> 08:44.212
Right.
Uh, thanks...

08:44.248 --> 08:46.148
- Rodge.
- Right.

08:46.183 --> 08:48.717
Um, Pete...

08:48.751 --> 08:51.286
So I got the forensics report.

08:51.321 --> 08:53.589
They found
sodium thiopental, Pavulon,

08:53.623 --> 08:55.990
and potassium chloride
in his blood...

08:56.025 --> 08:57.591
all of which are used
in lethal injections.

08:57.626 --> 09:01.028
All right, so maybe it's some
kind of execution artifact

09:01.062 --> 09:03.329
in the hands of a grieving
death row family member.

09:03.364 --> 09:06.498
Right, I'll get Steve to look
into those death row cases.

09:06.533 --> 09:09.000
I'll go look into that.

09:17.742 --> 09:19.008
Hey, hey, what's going on?

09:19.043 --> 09:22.811
Hysterical woman...
says she's stuck.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.281
Oh, help!
We're stuck!

09:27.316 --> 09:29.016
- Stuck to what?
- To each other!

09:36.230 --> 09:39.867
So, Spencer,
this is not your home?

09:40.021 --> 09:43.173
Uh, no, it's, uh...
it's my parents'.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.741
They're in Miami.

09:44.775 --> 09:47.511
So you were just...
you were just sitting around,

09:47.545 --> 09:50.514
chillaxing, just kicking
like a chicken?

09:50.548 --> 09:53.974
Uh, yeah, just, uh, working.

09:54.045 --> 09:55.812
Uh, I just sort of reached,

09:55.846 --> 09:57.447
and then it just
kind of happened.

09:57.482 --> 09:59.149
Pee-ooh!

09:59.183 --> 10:00.750
Uh, what... what
were you working on?

10:00.785 --> 10:04.020
- Oh, uh, my website.
- Website.

10:04.054 --> 10:05.888
Yeah.

10:05.923 --> 10:09.225
Uh, Spencer's this,
um, crazy web guru,

10:09.259 --> 10:12.662
and, um, I have
this candle business and...

10:13.831 --> 10:15.532
Have... have you two crazy kids

10:15.566 --> 10:19.436
come into contact
with any strange objects lately?

10:19.471 --> 10:22.673
- No, I...
- What about DA Chambers?

10:22.708 --> 10:25.377
Have you... have you crossed paths
with DA Chambers?

10:25.411 --> 10:27.813
Well, my husband, Gerry,
worked for the DA's office

10:27.847 --> 10:29.948
before he got fired
a few days ago.

10:29.983 --> 10:31.884
Why?

10:31.918 --> 10:33.185
Just excuse me a moment.

10:33.219 --> 10:34.688
- Hey!
- Hey!

10:36.092 --> 10:37.794
I know it sounds insane,

10:37.828 --> 10:40.664
but they're totally joined at
the waist, like siamese twins.

10:40.698 --> 10:43.700
And I'm thinking,
coo-coo-coo-choo, Mrs. Robinson.

10:43.734 --> 10:47.170
So you think she was fooling
around with this younger guy?

10:47.204 --> 10:48.705
I thought that they were
working on their laptops.

10:48.739 --> 10:51.308
Yeah, right,
well, that's what he said.

10:51.342 --> 10:53.010
But I noticed
his computer was off,

10:53.044 --> 10:56.080
and I saw him kick some motion
lotion underneath the couch.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.249
So, while his computer
may have been off,

10:58.283 --> 10:59.984
his laptop was definitely on.

11:00.018 --> 11:03.221
So Mr. LaBelle gets fired
by DA Chambers

11:03.255 --> 11:05.791
and then finds out
that his wife is cheating on him

11:05.825 --> 11:07.092
with this... this kid.

11:07.126 --> 11:09.662
Right and uses an artifact
to even the score.

11:09.696 --> 11:12.331
But what kind of artifact
poisons and conjoins?

11:12.365 --> 11:15.467
Unless he has two artifacts.

11:17.370 --> 11:19.038
God, the stench.

11:19.072 --> 11:21.206
It's like
when something bad goes bad.

11:21.241 --> 11:23.175
Yeah, well, that's what
the goo smells like

11:23.209 --> 11:25.744
after it neutralizes
an artifact.

11:25.778 --> 11:27.979
Relieving the pressure
helps normalize it.

11:28.014 --> 11:31.916
So did you unpack your stuff?

11:31.951 --> 11:33.351
Not yet.

11:33.386 --> 11:35.453
That's not really
why you stayed, is it?

11:35.488 --> 11:37.989
No.

11:38.024 --> 11:42.293
Well, it was,
but not only that, I guess.

11:42.328 --> 11:44.362
Okay, I'll bite.

11:44.397 --> 11:45.697
Talk to me.

11:45.731 --> 11:47.966
I don't know.
I-I...

11:48.000 --> 11:49.467
I guess it was a combination
of saying good-bye

11:49.502 --> 11:52.337
to my ex all over again
and then the trunk arriving.

11:52.371 --> 11:53.638
It suddenly occurred to me

11:53.673 --> 11:57.008
that literally my entire life
is here now.

11:57.043 --> 12:00.345
I'm... I'm finally completely
settled here permanently,

12:00.379 --> 12:02.681
like... like... like
Pete and Myka and Claudia.

12:02.715 --> 12:05.450
- And that's a bad thing?
- No.

12:05.485 --> 12:07.252
They say you get to share
your Warehouse life

12:07.287 --> 12:09.454
with one very important person.

12:09.489 --> 12:11.256
And none of them
have found anybody.

12:11.290 --> 12:14.492
And I'm about ten times
more shy than they are.

12:14.527 --> 12:16.127
I mean...

12:16.162 --> 12:17.362
- Uh, Steve?
- I got to think about this.

12:17.396 --> 12:19.330
I mean, is this
the kind of thing

12:19.364 --> 12:21.465
that I want for a guy like me?
Because I'm already so nervous.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.001
Oh, Steve! Watch out!

12:25.670 --> 12:28.504
Oh, God.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.607
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

12:30.641 --> 12:34.044
No, I'm fine. I...
No, I'm really good. I'm good.

12:34.078 --> 12:36.179
Is there something
I should do...

12:36.214 --> 12:38.281
maybe hose you down
or something?

12:38.316 --> 12:41.818
No, no, no, thanks.
I'm, uh...

12:41.852 --> 12:43.687
I'm just gonna go have a shower

12:43.721 --> 12:46.857
with some shred
of dignity left.

12:46.892 --> 12:50.061
Careful.
Careful.

12:58.669 --> 13:01.070
So, Nick,
it happened again, huh?

13:01.105 --> 13:03.840
I guess so.

13:03.874 --> 13:05.308
About an hour ago.

13:05.342 --> 13:07.009
Yeah, you want
to tell me about it?

13:08.679 --> 13:10.913
Why, so you'll think
I'm crazy too?

13:10.948 --> 13:13.750
I don't think you're crazy.

13:13.784 --> 13:15.352
Forget it.

13:15.386 --> 13:17.654
If you're trying to put me
back in foster care, I won't go.

13:17.689 --> 13:19.156
Whoa. No.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.158
We are so not
social services, okay?

13:21.193 --> 13:23.161
- So you can relax.
- Right.

13:23.195 --> 13:25.730
Good.
Believe everything you say.

13:25.765 --> 13:27.799
Well, you have no reason
to believe everything I say,

13:27.834 --> 13:30.202
but I did go through the system,
and I'm not a fan.

13:30.237 --> 13:32.538
I know it can suck.

13:32.572 --> 13:35.507
- You were in foster care?
- Yeah.

13:35.542 --> 13:37.076
And I wasn't about
to go looking

13:37.110 --> 13:39.345
for any more abusive father
figures to smack me around,

13:39.379 --> 13:41.080
so I did my time
on the streets instead.

13:41.114 --> 13:42.715
Yeah?
Where?

13:42.749 --> 13:45.317
Minneapolis, three months...

13:45.352 --> 13:47.185
wouldn't recommend it
in February.

13:47.220 --> 13:51.457
And even that was warmer
than the psych ward.

13:51.491 --> 13:54.126
Look, I understand
being locked up

13:54.161 --> 13:56.896
for talking about something
unexplainable... I really do.

13:56.930 --> 14:00.967
We're the guys
who explain the unexplainable.

14:01.001 --> 14:03.536
But, buddy, you got to talk
to me first.

14:03.571 --> 14:06.573
I don't know what happens.

14:06.607 --> 14:11.311
But before the seizure starts,
I get, like, these visions...

14:11.345 --> 14:14.948
Like I'm someplace else,
and I'm not in control,

14:14.982 --> 14:16.615
like...

14:16.901 --> 14:21.119
Like my body's here,
but my mind is someplace else.

14:21.154 --> 14:23.622
Hey, thank you.

14:23.656 --> 14:26.091
Look, don't worry. We're gonna
figure this out, okay?

14:26.125 --> 14:27.358
- Claudia?
- Yep?

14:27.393 --> 14:28.860
Excuse me.

14:28.894 --> 14:30.261
Listen...

14:30.295 --> 14:33.965
The MRI shows massive
neurological seizures...

14:33.999 --> 14:37.835
bursts of electrical activity
that are ten times stronger

14:37.869 --> 14:39.937
than any epileptic seizures.

14:39.971 --> 14:41.305
This thing's frying his brain?

14:41.339 --> 14:42.640
Essentially, yeah.

14:42.674 --> 14:47.578
And if it keeps happening,
it's gonna kill him.

14:47.613 --> 14:49.447
Well, he's home.

14:49.481 --> 14:50.848
I don't think
anybody's told him yet

14:50.882 --> 14:52.816
about his wife and Spencer
going to the hospital

14:52.850 --> 14:54.551
all joined up and such.

14:54.585 --> 14:57.287
Yeah, that should be
fun news to deliver.

14:57.321 --> 15:00.790
Mr. LaBelle,
it's Rex in security.

15:02.926 --> 15:05.994
Mr. LaBelle,
it's Secret Service.

15:16.338 --> 15:18.973
Mr. LaBelle?

15:19.007 --> 15:22.177
Agents Bering and Lattimer...
we're with the Secret Service.

15:22.211 --> 15:25.146
What's this about, Rex?

15:25.181 --> 15:28.491
We have some questions
to ask you about DA Chambers.

15:28.536 --> 15:29.736
Oh.

15:29.919 --> 15:31.061
Sure.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.288
Right.

15:35.319 --> 15:36.625
Common misconception...

15:36.659 --> 15:39.161
running does not make you
look innocent.

15:39.195 --> 15:42.164
Today is not
the day to test him.

15:42.199 --> 15:44.700
- Now, where's the artifact?
- The what?

15:44.734 --> 15:47.469
Whatever you used
to poison DA Chambers...

15:47.504 --> 15:48.504
where is it?

15:48.538 --> 15:50.172
I didn't use anything, I swear.

15:50.206 --> 15:51.440
I-I just broke his windshield.

15:51.474 --> 15:53.442
Yeah? Then why'd you
take a swing at me?

15:53.476 --> 15:55.444
I panicked.
I knew you'd think I killed him.

15:55.478 --> 15:56.778
- I didn't!
- You killed him,

15:56.813 --> 15:57.979
and then you went
after your wife

15:58.014 --> 15:59.715
when you found out
she was cheating.

15:59.749 --> 16:02.484
Leslie's cheating...
on me?

16:02.519 --> 16:05.020
How did... with who?

16:05.055 --> 16:07.256
Do my kids know?

16:09.426 --> 16:12.662
You smell that?
Something's burning.

16:15.900 --> 16:18.067
Dude, you're on fire.

16:26.545 --> 16:29.056
Pete, need to stand back!

16:42.714 --> 16:45.283
Okay, Mykes, we... we got
to find this thing.

16:45.318 --> 16:47.206
I mean, with burns like those,
that guy could still die.

16:47.292 --> 16:48.526
All these people
are starting to panic.

16:48.589 --> 16:50.057
We are back to square one.

16:50.091 --> 16:51.391
LaBelle clearly did not know

16:51.425 --> 16:52.926
that his wife
was cheating on him.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.627
So, okay, what do we know?

16:54.662 --> 16:57.564
We got... we got three victims
from three different attacks

16:57.598 --> 16:59.899
which may or may not have come
from the same artifact.

16:59.934 --> 17:02.969
Well, they all lived here
at Crown Heights.

17:03.004 --> 17:04.637
So who have we met in town

17:04.672 --> 17:06.961
who might be able
to tell us what's going on?

17:09.776 --> 17:11.047
Toodles.

17:12.945 --> 17:14.746
I'll get us some tea.

17:14.781 --> 17:16.815
So, um, Mrs. Malloy...

17:16.848 --> 17:18.750
Janice, please.

17:18.784 --> 17:21.752
It's Janice.

17:21.787 --> 17:23.954
How long has Rex worked here?

17:23.989 --> 17:27.958
Um, a while...
Maybe eight years.

17:27.992 --> 17:31.128
Hmm. And was he,
uh, especially close

17:31.162 --> 17:35.065
with either DA Chambers
or Mrs. LaBelle or Spencer?

17:35.099 --> 17:37.367
Mykes, you got to try
these cookies.

17:37.401 --> 17:39.870
No, I don't think so.

17:39.904 --> 17:42.038
You know, Rex...
he always kept to himself,

17:42.073 --> 17:44.574
even after his condo
burned down and he moved in...

17:44.609 --> 17:45.876
His condo burned down?

17:45.910 --> 17:47.377
As in with fire?

17:47.412 --> 17:49.579
Yeah, a fire
about three months ago...

17:49.613 --> 17:51.815
Faulty wiring, I think.

17:51.849 --> 17:53.717
And then the board let him
live in our rec room

17:53.751 --> 17:55.619
while he settles
with his insurance company.

17:55.653 --> 17:57.087
Huh.

17:58.756 --> 18:02.459
- Mm.
- Mm.

18:03.761 --> 18:06.096
Oh, hey.

18:06.131 --> 18:07.631
Hey, I... uh, you all right?

18:07.665 --> 18:09.666
- Back in one piece.
- Yeah, I'm sorry that I just...

18:09.701 --> 18:11.802
- I left you down there.
- No, no problem.

18:11.836 --> 18:13.137
I managed to clean out
the last filter

18:13.171 --> 18:15.974
before the, uh,
nausea overwhelmed me.

18:16.008 --> 18:17.409
What about you?
Are... are you okay?

18:17.443 --> 18:19.745
Oh, yeah, no, I'm sure
that the, um...

18:19.779 --> 18:22.547
the... the goo smell will leave
my sinuses in a few years.

18:24.050 --> 18:26.485
Guess that's karma for me
trying to mooch free advice.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.020
Oh, no, the Regents
brought me here

18:28.055 --> 18:29.989
to help with issues
exactly like this.

18:30.023 --> 18:32.291
And, um, I happen to know
a thing or two

18:32.326 --> 18:33.593
about being alone.

18:33.627 --> 18:35.161
You know, I'm a therapist.

18:35.195 --> 18:36.863
I don't make a lot
of friends at work.

18:36.897 --> 18:38.731
Mm.

18:38.766 --> 18:40.433
I imagine in the regular world,

18:40.467 --> 18:42.969
once you tell people
what you do, they, uh...

18:43.003 --> 18:44.271
they want to unload.

18:44.305 --> 18:48.208
Or they put their guards up,
which is why I quit.

18:48.243 --> 18:50.044
No, it's not.

18:50.078 --> 18:52.713
Oh, oh, God, I'm...
no, I'm sorry.

18:52.748 --> 18:54.715
- It's something that I do... it's...
- The human lie detector.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.283
Yeah.
Yeah, that's me, yeah.

18:56.318 --> 18:58.386
I meant to say it's one

18:58.420 --> 19:00.488
of the reasons why I quit.

19:00.523 --> 19:02.190
I guess I don't like
to talk about it.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.492
You don't have to.

19:03.526 --> 19:05.628
No, it's... it's good for me.
I just...

19:05.662 --> 19:08.297
You want to...

19:08.332 --> 19:09.398
Sit down?

19:09.433 --> 19:12.668
- Yeah.
- Step into my office.

19:15.805 --> 19:17.573
So, um...

19:17.607 --> 19:21.744
Two years ago,
I had a patient who, uh...

19:24.615 --> 19:27.016
I couldn't help him.

19:27.050 --> 19:31.220
I guess I was afraid
that it would happen again,

19:31.254 --> 19:32.922
so...

19:32.956 --> 19:35.125
I quit...

19:35.159 --> 19:38.761
and went traveling,
just me and my camera...

19:38.795 --> 19:42.765
another observational tool
to hide behind.

19:42.799 --> 19:44.833
Physician know thyself, right?

19:44.868 --> 19:46.435
So how did you end up here?

19:46.469 --> 19:50.305
I was in Burma photographing
political prisoners

19:50.340 --> 19:51.907
when I met Adwin Kosan.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.275
And he said he had
a sense about me

19:54.310 --> 19:55.810
and told me
about the Warehouse.

19:55.845 --> 19:58.513
Wow.
He found me in New Jersey.

19:58.547 --> 20:03.384
You know, I thought
I knew things, but...

20:03.419 --> 20:05.219
this place...

20:07.990 --> 20:11.759
Well, I guess
that's what we have in common.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.795
We're a bunch of lonely
misfit toys

20:13.829 --> 20:15.063
that the Warehouse collects.

20:15.097 --> 20:19.300
Except now you have each other.

20:19.334 --> 20:21.970
Maybe that's why
you're so anxious

20:22.004 --> 20:24.138
about your things arriving.

20:24.173 --> 20:25.640
How do you mean?

20:25.674 --> 20:28.142
Well, you said you were worried

20:28.177 --> 20:30.544
about not having someone
to share you life with.

20:30.579 --> 20:33.481
Now it seems to me
like you might have

20:33.515 --> 20:36.417
four special, unique someones.

20:36.452 --> 20:41.322
And for now,
they might be your one.

20:41.356 --> 20:43.090
And it might be time for you

20:43.124 --> 20:46.293
to share a little more
of yourself with them,

20:46.327 --> 20:50.797
which can be scary.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.100
Artie said you were good.

20:56.137 --> 20:58.772
None of these equations
seem to be solving anything.

20:58.806 --> 21:00.874
"For all 'T'
not equal to 'S'"...

21:00.909 --> 21:01.975
what the hell?

21:02.010 --> 21:04.778
I hate having only one clue.

21:04.812 --> 21:06.246
Is he always like this?

21:07.815 --> 21:09.683
Usually grumpier.
He's just distracted.

21:09.718 --> 21:12.320
So what is this place anyway?

21:12.354 --> 21:16.691
Uh, it looks like it might
have been an old NSA safe house.

21:16.725 --> 21:19.461
Now they obviously
use it to shoot porn.

21:22.798 --> 21:24.299
Hey, that's St. Jude, right?

21:24.333 --> 21:26.802
Patron saint of lost causes.

21:26.836 --> 21:28.303
Where'd you get this?

21:28.338 --> 21:30.272
Um, one of my foster moms.

21:30.306 --> 21:33.609
There was this kid at school
who used to terrify me.

21:33.643 --> 21:35.711
And Mrs. I said
that I should pray to St. Jude

21:35.746 --> 21:37.246
if I ever had nightmares.

21:37.281 --> 21:38.781
I need one of those.

21:38.815 --> 21:42.819
Do you mind if I...?

21:42.853 --> 21:45.555
You still have nightmares?

21:45.589 --> 21:48.524
Like a never-ending
sci-fi miniseries...

21:48.559 --> 21:52.562
about the psych ward,
about my brother being lost,

21:52.597 --> 21:55.799
and more recently
about this guy.

21:55.834 --> 21:57.801
He killed my friend.

21:57.835 --> 21:59.837
Whoa.

21:59.871 --> 22:01.239
What happened to him?

22:01.273 --> 22:04.609
Ha!
You sneaky little bastards.

22:04.643 --> 22:06.611
No, no, not you, not you.
I think I've got it!

22:06.646 --> 22:08.480
- Here, I need you.
- Sit tight.

22:08.514 --> 22:11.149
- Yes, Dr. Frankenstein?
- Ha ha. Yeah, what hump?

22:11.184 --> 22:14.219
Okay, so you... you keep seeing
programming code.

22:14.254 --> 22:15.987
I keep seeing
probability formula.

22:16.022 --> 22:17.789
It turns out...

22:17.824 --> 22:19.791
Both are used
by investment firms

22:19.826 --> 22:21.960
in their marketing analysis
programming languages.

22:21.995 --> 22:23.328
Can I get the tweeted version?

22:23.363 --> 22:26.631
Banks hire physicists
and statisticians

22:26.666 --> 22:29.034
so they can create numerical
price-hedging models.

22:29.068 --> 22:31.203
- Like derivatives.
- And other things.

22:31.237 --> 22:33.138
And the bank's employees
are called quants.

22:33.172 --> 22:35.674
They're quantitative analysts.

22:35.708 --> 22:37.309
You know what
their work looks like?

22:37.343 --> 22:39.144
- What?
- Exactly like this-o-rama.

22:39.179 --> 22:40.579
Nice.

22:40.613 --> 22:42.314
So it's no coinkydink
we're near wall street,

22:42.348 --> 22:44.416
but what... what would Nick
have to do with any of it?

22:44.450 --> 22:46.685
Yeah, Nick...

22:49.355 --> 22:51.890
Oh, Artie, he's having
another vision...

22:51.925 --> 22:53.792
Which means he's gonna have
another seizure,

22:53.827 --> 22:54.827
so we should be ready.

22:54.861 --> 22:56.195
Nick says that he feels

22:56.229 --> 22:58.263
as if he's being transported
to another space, right?

22:58.298 --> 23:01.100
If there's an artifact and
if a quant is somehow using it,

23:01.134 --> 23:03.035
we have to get Nick to give us
more details about where he is,

23:03.069 --> 23:05.103
- so we can track the artifact.
- Yes.

23:05.138 --> 23:09.475
Nick, can you tell me
where you are or what you see?

23:14.314 --> 23:16.148
I see a man's hands.

23:16.182 --> 23:17.716
Yeah, what... what
are they doing?

23:17.750 --> 23:18.950
What are they doing?

23:18.985 --> 23:21.287
They're doing what I'm doing.

23:21.321 --> 23:24.056
Yeah, they're mirroring
his actions... what else?

23:24.090 --> 23:25.257
Artie, he's already seizing.

23:25.292 --> 23:27.326
The downside of the artifact
is intensifying.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.827
We have to stop this.

23:28.862 --> 23:30.996
We got to keep going.
We got to save him.

23:31.031 --> 23:33.065
What else?

23:33.099 --> 23:35.734
Um, I'm in an office.

23:35.769 --> 23:40.606
I see a blue mug
and some whiteboard...

23:40.640 --> 23:42.041
A clock with an antelope.

23:42.075 --> 23:43.342
- That's enough.
- All right, all right.

23:43.377 --> 23:45.011
Okay, all right, all right,
get him on the couch.

23:45.045 --> 23:46.846
All right, hold him, hold him.

23:46.881 --> 23:48.515
- You got him?
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

23:48.549 --> 23:51.751
All right.

23:51.786 --> 23:54.087
- What is that?
- Joseph Stalin's sleep mask.

23:54.121 --> 23:55.354
It's the only thing

23:55.389 --> 23:58.257
that would let that paranoid
dictator actually sleep.

24:04.731 --> 24:07.266
All right, so there's
got to be some connection

24:07.301 --> 24:08.968
between Rex
and the other victims.

24:09.002 --> 24:10.770
Well, maybe they all
stumbled on to some secret,

24:10.804 --> 24:12.371
and now they're paying
the price for it.

24:12.406 --> 24:14.607
Mykes, doesn't it seem
kind of weirdly lucky

24:14.641 --> 24:17.776
that the fire didn't touch any
of his expensive electronics?

24:17.811 --> 24:20.245
Janice did say that Rex
was waiting for a settlement

24:20.280 --> 24:22.381
from his
insurance company, right?

24:22.415 --> 24:25.717
Yep, well, he should have
had his testosterone checked,

24:25.751 --> 24:28.319
'cause this weight is nothing.

24:28.354 --> 24:31.222
Ah.

24:31.256 --> 24:34.125
Pete, this is a notice of
a secondary arson investigation.

24:34.159 --> 24:36.961
It says that they found
traces of boric acid

24:36.995 --> 24:38.462
in his power outlets.

24:38.496 --> 24:39.930
Boric acid?

24:39.965 --> 24:42.066
Boric acid...
it burns green.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.801
I saw it on
<i>Bill Nye The Science Guy.</i>

24:43.835 --> 24:45.303
Rex burned the same color.

24:45.337 --> 24:48.072
So this is
a cause-and-effect artifact.

24:48.106 --> 24:50.007
I don't know...
he torched his place

24:50.041 --> 24:51.241
and went up in flames with it.

24:51.276 --> 24:53.744
Mrs. LaBelle and Spencer
were boinking, right?

24:53.778 --> 24:55.012
- Right.
- Now they're conjoined.

24:55.046 --> 24:57.581
One was an arsonist,
the other two adulterers...

24:57.615 --> 24:59.616
all being punished
with their own sins.

24:59.650 --> 25:00.884
Yeah, but what
about DA Chambers?

25:00.918 --> 25:02.519
It was his job
to put people away.

25:02.553 --> 25:04.888
Unless he did something
unethical during a murder case

25:04.923 --> 25:06.724
which resulted
in a lethal injection.

25:06.758 --> 25:08.459
So we need to start
telling Steve

25:08.493 --> 25:10.394
to research
sin-related artifacts?

25:10.428 --> 25:12.596
Yeah, and we need to figure out

25:12.631 --> 25:15.933
who in this town is so obsessed
with morality that...

25:15.968 --> 25:17.102
- Colonel Cassel.
- What?

25:17.136 --> 25:18.703
- C-Colonel Cassel, remember?

25:18.738 --> 25:20.939
"Rules are rules, soldiers.

25:20.974 --> 25:22.641
"And once you start
breaking 'em,

25:22.676 --> 25:25.343
- it's a slippery slope to hell."
- Right.

25:25.378 --> 25:26.945
It's kind of
a Burgess Meredith thing.

25:26.979 --> 25:29.614
- It's very weird.
- I don't know.

25:29.649 --> 25:33.885
His cart is here,
but he won't answer.

25:43.328 --> 25:46.297
Colonel Cassel?

25:48.601 --> 25:51.069
Colonel Cassel?

26:00.346 --> 26:03.148
I got this.
You call 911.

26:10.972 --> 26:15.331
Yes, yes, we're
at 106 Woodpecker Crescent.

26:15.433 --> 26:17.977
Yes, in Crown...
in Crown Heights.

26:18.012 --> 26:19.646
Yes. Thank you.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.981
- Colonel.
- How is this happening?

26:22.016 --> 26:24.284
- How is what happening?
- Somebody knows.

26:24.318 --> 26:26.052
That's why
they're doing this to me.

26:26.086 --> 26:27.453
Somebody knows what?

26:27.488 --> 26:29.789
Did you do something illegal
or... or immoral in your past?

26:29.823 --> 26:31.458
Something...
What? No! No!

26:31.492 --> 26:33.626
Colonel,
you need to tell us, okay?

26:33.661 --> 26:35.995
There could be a connection.

26:36.030 --> 26:37.163
Okay.

26:37.198 --> 26:38.799
All right.

26:38.833 --> 26:42.269
It was Kuwait, '91.

26:42.303 --> 26:45.772
Our unit was stranded
in a village.

26:45.806 --> 26:47.607
We were outnumbered
four to one.

26:47.641 --> 26:50.811
We knew where the enemy was.

26:50.845 --> 26:52.646
The locals were harboring them.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.148
They had whole stockpiles
of gas.

26:55.183 --> 26:57.151
We had no choice.

26:57.185 --> 26:59.420
We gassed the whole village,

26:59.454 --> 27:02.122
killed 'em all
in their sleep...

27:02.157 --> 27:04.258
women, children.

27:04.292 --> 27:07.328
God, forgive me.

27:07.362 --> 27:09.497
We should have died
that morning.

27:09.531 --> 27:12.467
Instead, we got
Liberation Of Kuwait medals.

27:12.501 --> 27:14.069
Listen to me.

27:14.103 --> 27:15.937
Okay, listen to me.

27:15.972 --> 27:17.806
Okay, when you said,
"Somebody knows,"

27:17.840 --> 27:20.042
did you mean somebody here
in Crown Heights?

27:22.078 --> 27:25.614
I don't know.

27:25.648 --> 27:29.218
Okay, just lie back. Relax.
Someone's here to help you.

27:29.252 --> 27:31.387
Just try and breathe.

27:33.656 --> 27:35.824
Mykes, someone here
is doing this.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.569
Well, we better find out who
before we have a mass exodus

27:47.603 --> 27:49.504
and we lose
this artifact for good.

27:51.374 --> 27:52.774
How is he?

27:52.808 --> 27:54.843
Well, heart rate's low.
Blood pressure's high.

27:54.877 --> 27:56.311
I'm getting
erratic brain activity.

27:56.345 --> 27:58.647
I don't think he's gonna survive
another seizure.

27:58.681 --> 28:00.382
We can't let
this kid die, Jinksy.

28:00.416 --> 28:02.083
So you think that this artifact

28:02.118 --> 28:04.986
is tethering him to a quant
somewhere and doing his math?

28:05.021 --> 28:08.723
Yeah, his mind seems to be
going wherever the quant is.

28:08.757 --> 28:09.924
He described an office.

28:09.958 --> 28:11.559
You think this quant is nearby,

28:11.594 --> 28:12.827
or is he affecting Nick
at a distance?

28:12.862 --> 28:14.362
Well, it theoretically
could be anywhere.

28:14.396 --> 28:17.198
These psychic artifacts...
they can work from afar.

28:17.232 --> 28:19.434
The brooch that Queen Isabella
gave Columbus...

28:19.468 --> 28:21.269
that could make you brave
from across an ocean.

28:21.304 --> 28:23.438
Well, we're hoping
the quant is closer, obviously.

28:23.472 --> 28:25.073
Nick said he saw a clock
with an antelope,

28:25.108 --> 28:27.109
so I've been cross-checking
with New York investment houses.

28:27.143 --> 28:29.444
Yeah, but why would
a quant want to be tied

28:29.479 --> 28:31.914
- to a boy who barely knows math?
- Wait. Wait.

28:31.948 --> 28:34.283
You said that quants
analyze a vast amount of data

28:34.317 --> 28:36.151
and apply them
to numerical models, right?

28:36.186 --> 28:37.886
Yeah, they're...
all firms use them.

28:37.921 --> 28:41.257
Well, that would take a huge
amount of mental capacity.

28:41.291 --> 28:44.127
You see, young brains
are still developing,

28:44.161 --> 28:46.863
and so they're more flexible,
and they have the ability

28:46.897 --> 28:49.232
to make more connections
than adult brains.

28:49.266 --> 28:50.767
So you're saying
that someone is using

28:50.801 --> 28:52.702
Nick's young brainpower
to help them do their work.

28:52.737 --> 28:54.104
Like a hacker
borrowing a server.

28:54.139 --> 28:56.407
Not that I've ever done that.

28:56.441 --> 28:58.776
Okay, what about
Sir Isaac Newton's cravat?

28:58.810 --> 28:59.844
It gives the wearer insight

28:59.878 --> 29:01.579
if you wipe it
across your forehead.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.682
The downside... it increases
your gravitational pull

29:03.716 --> 29:04.750
till you can't move.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.485
It does not create
a psychic link.

29:06.519 --> 29:07.720
I got it.

29:07.754 --> 29:09.388
Four Wall Street banks
have logos with horns.

29:09.422 --> 29:11.490
Only one has an antelope...
Armstrong Investing.

29:11.525 --> 29:13.325
That's it.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.093
That's what I saw.

29:15.128 --> 29:18.597
Guys, that's Pete and Myka.
We'll keep looking.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.332
Why do I suddenly want vodka?

29:20.366 --> 29:22.934
Oh, yeah. No, that's just the
downside of the sleeping mask.

29:22.969 --> 29:24.769
It'll be gone in 30 seconds.

29:24.804 --> 29:27.772
But now I want vodka.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.242
So the tight-ass
we thought had the artifact

29:30.276 --> 29:33.846
turns out to be a gas-spewing
chimney from Mars.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.948
Okay, uh, we started
with sin-related

29:35.983 --> 29:37.317
and ended up
at biblical artifacts

29:37.351 --> 29:39.719
and the closest we got
to divine punishment

29:39.754 --> 29:42.122
was an obscure version
of the Sodom And Gomorrah story.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.058
It says that when Sodom
was razed for its sins,

29:44.092 --> 29:45.659
a windstorm buried it

29:45.694 --> 29:47.394
in the salt dunes
that made it so wealthy.

29:47.429 --> 29:48.863
Yeah,
apparently Warehouse 3 agents

29:48.897 --> 29:50.698
feared that a handful
of artifacts

29:50.733 --> 29:52.467
may have been created that day
as salt-covered objects

29:52.502 --> 29:53.702
and took their shape.

29:53.736 --> 29:55.504
But it didn't say
what those objects were.

29:55.539 --> 29:58.307
But why is somebody targeting
these specific people?

29:58.342 --> 30:00.043
I mean, is it
just because they live here?

30:00.077 --> 30:02.512
Or because they sinned?

30:02.546 --> 30:03.513
Everybody sins.

30:03.547 --> 30:05.015
There has to be
another connection.

30:05.049 --> 30:06.616
I got it.

30:06.651 --> 30:08.852
- What?
- Mykes, look.

30:08.886 --> 30:11.487
It's because they're all
Crown Heights board members...

30:11.522 --> 30:14.223
DA Chambers, Mrs. LaBelle,
Colonel Cassel.

30:14.258 --> 30:16.826
So maybe a disgruntled resident

30:16.860 --> 30:18.027
is targeting board members.

30:18.061 --> 30:19.262
Yes, but why?

30:19.296 --> 30:22.499
And Rex the security guard
is not on this list.

30:22.533 --> 30:25.268
Here...

30:25.303 --> 30:27.003
You can read all about it.

30:27.038 --> 30:29.105
Steve, keep digging
on the artifact.

30:29.140 --> 30:33.610
I'm gonna go check out this last
board member, Mr. John Foster.

30:33.644 --> 30:35.946
Pete, just be careful.

30:38.983 --> 30:40.550
And did you hear from Steve?

30:40.585 --> 30:42.452
No, but I did find an article

30:42.487 --> 30:45.122
crediting Armstrong's
algorithmic trading

30:45.156 --> 30:48.891
quantitative analysts
for their recent success... "ATQ."

30:48.926 --> 30:51.127
Got it.

30:51.161 --> 30:53.429
So maybe
if there's a section...

30:53.463 --> 30:55.197
Uh-oh.
Artie.

30:55.231 --> 30:56.632
Oh, no.
It's happening again.

30:56.666 --> 30:58.734
I'm gonna need
specific directions.

30:58.768 --> 31:00.803
This place is huge.

31:03.140 --> 31:06.009
Nick, Nick, can you hear me?
Can you tell me what you see?

31:10.748 --> 31:13.049
I'm in the same office
as before.

31:13.084 --> 31:16.253
I ne... I need more.
Something specific?

31:16.287 --> 31:19.722
Door with frosted glass
and a desk in front of it.

31:19.757 --> 31:23.125
Frosted glass
and... and desks.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.694
They've all got
frosted glass and desks.

31:25.729 --> 31:27.229
Nick, what else?

31:28.664 --> 31:30.632
I know you can do this.
Come on.

31:30.667 --> 31:34.002
I hear that song from
the "Kill The Wabbit" cartoon.

31:34.037 --> 31:36.204
Artie, I don't know... he keeps
hearing "Kill The Wabbit."

31:36.238 --> 31:39.474
"Kill The Wabbit"?

31:39.508 --> 31:42.443
"Kill The Wabbit."

31:42.478 --> 31:45.746
"K..."
<i>[Ride Of The Valkyries</i> plays]

31:45.781 --> 31:47.048
Oh, "Kill The Wabbit."

31:47.082 --> 31:49.384
Okay. All right.

31:49.418 --> 31:50.785
I got you.

31:55.457 --> 31:57.424
Of course, Orville Wright's
aviator goggles.

31:57.459 --> 32:00.294
Take 'em off!

32:00.328 --> 32:02.296
Artie, come on.

32:02.331 --> 32:03.831
Why?

32:03.866 --> 32:05.867
'Cause if I'm right,
they belong to the less talented

32:05.901 --> 32:07.802
of the Wright Brothers who
imbued them with the ability

32:07.837 --> 32:09.638
to steal other people's
brainpower... never mind.

32:09.672 --> 32:12.407
You're killing a young boy
by wearing them.

32:12.442 --> 32:14.443
Come on, Artie!

32:17.947 --> 32:20.248
Are you okay?

32:20.283 --> 32:22.284
Okay.

32:22.318 --> 32:23.986
Artie, you did it.

32:24.020 --> 32:26.488
I don't know what you did,
but it worked... Nick's okay.

32:26.522 --> 32:29.291
Okay.

32:29.325 --> 32:33.696
Lucy, you've got
some "splaining" to do.

32:33.730 --> 32:35.431
Well, that was

32:35.465 --> 32:37.867
way more testosterone-y
than picking a lock.

32:37.901 --> 32:39.635
John Foster?

32:39.669 --> 32:41.303
Hey, Mykes.

32:41.338 --> 32:43.205
I think I know
who has the artifact.

32:43.239 --> 32:46.675
Last week the board rejected,
for the third time,

32:46.709 --> 32:48.977
a petition from Janice Malloy.

32:49.011 --> 32:52.347
She wanted to erect a bust
of her late husband,

32:52.381 --> 32:54.482
the founder of Crown Heights.

32:54.516 --> 32:56.017
What about Rex?

32:56.051 --> 32:57.785
Rex spoke out against the bust,

32:57.819 --> 33:00.955
saying it would "Tempt vandals
for no good reason."

33:00.989 --> 33:04.391
So Janice is doing
this whole thing over a bust?

33:04.426 --> 33:05.693
You said it, right?

33:05.727 --> 33:07.795
Twisted priorities,
but, you know,

33:07.830 --> 33:09.797
we still don't know
how she did it.

33:09.832 --> 33:14.002
She might be doing it
to John Foster right now.

33:21.044 --> 33:23.079
Oh, my God.
Her chocolate cookies.

33:23.113 --> 33:24.247
What?

33:24.281 --> 33:26.416
What... whose...
whose cookies... Janice's?

33:26.450 --> 33:29.252
When sodom
was razed for its sins,

33:29.286 --> 33:30.720
it was buried by a windstorm

33:30.755 --> 33:32.989
in the salt dunes
that made it so wealthy.

33:33.023 --> 33:34.323
The salt, Pete.

33:34.357 --> 33:35.624
I know.

33:35.659 --> 33:37.059
That's what made 'em so good.

33:37.093 --> 33:40.029
Pete, w-what if the handful
of artifacts

33:40.063 --> 33:41.530
that were created
by the windstorm

33:41.565 --> 33:45.034
weren't the objects
that the salt covered,

33:45.068 --> 33:47.003
but the salt itself?

33:47.037 --> 33:50.372
What if it's imbued
with some sort of power?

33:50.407 --> 33:53.943
Salt from Janice's cookies?

33:53.977 --> 33:55.344
Whoa.

33:55.379 --> 33:56.254
That would...

33:56.293 --> 33:57.504
suck!

34:03.921 --> 34:06.011
Gah! Gah!
Oh, my...

34:06.054 --> 34:07.087
- Pete!
- God!

34:07.122 --> 34:08.121
Pete!

34:09.623 --> 34:12.092
God!
Pete, don't move, okay?

34:12.127 --> 34:15.466
Okay, I won't,
'cause I don't think I can.

34:15.529 --> 34:18.230
I think my legs are broken.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.308
Myka, go get Janice
and bag the artifact!

34:21.342 --> 34:23.810
- Go!
- Okay.

34:24.946 --> 34:27.648
Oh, yeah, they look good.

34:27.681 --> 34:29.216
I could lose
a little weight here,

34:29.250 --> 34:31.484
but, uh, oh, they look good.

34:31.518 --> 34:32.614
Thank you very much.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.473
- Don't eat that!
- Hey! What the...

34:34.543 --> 34:36.456
Trust me, okay?
I know what you've been doing.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.260
Oh, my God, the salt... the salt
covered a person's face

34:39.293 --> 34:40.628
and took its shape.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.498
Shut up!

34:43.532 --> 34:45.299
That's what you've been using
to hurt people, isn't it?

34:45.333 --> 34:46.998
All for what, Janice?
What... a bust?

34:47.083 --> 34:48.984
No, it's my husband!
He built Crown Heights!

34:49.018 --> 34:50.719
Get back!

34:50.754 --> 34:52.688
Our whole marriage
is about this place,

34:52.722 --> 34:55.257
down to naming the streets
after our favorite birds!

34:55.292 --> 34:57.059
He loved Crown Heights!

34:57.092 --> 34:58.527
He... he gave his life to it,

34:58.562 --> 35:02.198
and they...
they want to wipe him...

35:02.232 --> 35:04.100
they want to wipe him out!

35:07.304 --> 35:09.873
Give me the mask.

35:14.245 --> 35:16.045
Just save it, Janice.

35:16.080 --> 35:19.315
It's getting worse.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.051
Look, I bagged it, all right?
It's...

35:21.085 --> 35:23.119
Oh, my God, Myka.
Oh, my God.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.888
Why isn't it working?

35:24.922 --> 35:27.591
Okay, listen,
we just... now we just, uh...

35:27.625 --> 35:31.160
Colonel Cassel, what happened?

35:31.195 --> 35:32.629
They sent me home.

35:32.663 --> 35:35.899
As soon as I left you,
I started feeling fi... good lord.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.268
Is he all right?

35:37.302 --> 35:40.572
No, just go
and please call an ambulance!

35:40.606 --> 35:43.575
Okay, so we just... we just
have to figure out

35:43.609 --> 35:45.744
what happened when he left us.

35:45.778 --> 35:48.113
Okay, what... what...
what did we do?

35:48.148 --> 35:49.482
He...

35:49.516 --> 35:51.183
We gassed the whole village,

35:51.218 --> 35:52.852
killed 'em all
in their sleep...

35:52.886 --> 35:55.120
women, children.

35:55.155 --> 35:56.188
Forgive me.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.290
We made him confess, right?

35:58.325 --> 35:59.658
Pete, listen to me.

35:59.693 --> 36:01.627
I think that you
have to confess, okay?

36:01.661 --> 36:04.096
I think I'm just gonna wait
till the ambulance comes.

36:04.131 --> 36:06.932
You can't wait
for the ambulance, okay?

36:06.967 --> 36:09.836
The only thing that will work
is a confession, all right?

36:09.870 --> 36:13.039
Whatever it is, just trust me.
Tell me, okay?

36:13.074 --> 36:16.743
I'm... I'm your partner.
Just talk to me.

36:16.778 --> 36:19.546
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.281
It was
when I was still drinking

36:21.316 --> 36:24.952
and...

36:27.356 --> 36:31.792
I was... I was young,
and I was... I was cocky.

36:31.827 --> 36:35.129
It was stupid, Myka.
I don't...

36:35.163 --> 36:37.465
and I was...
oh, I was drunk, man.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.667
I was drunk.

36:39.701 --> 36:42.169
I got behind the wheel.

36:42.204 --> 36:45.639
It was an...

36:45.674 --> 36:48.809
I was such an idiot.
I don't know why.

36:48.844 --> 36:52.313
I lost control of the car.

36:52.347 --> 36:53.981
I hit a tree,

36:54.015 --> 36:55.482
but I walked away.

36:55.517 --> 36:59.319
I walked away,
not a... not a damn scratch.

36:59.353 --> 37:01.788
But my buddy Dave...

37:01.823 --> 37:06.327
he... he got...
he got thrown from the car.

37:09.698 --> 37:12.999
And he broke both his legs.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.600
And I did that.

37:14.634 --> 37:16.835
I did that.

37:16.870 --> 37:18.370
I'm responsible for that.

37:18.404 --> 37:19.938
I'm sorry.

37:19.973 --> 37:21.473
I'm sorry.

37:21.508 --> 37:24.376
I...

37:24.410 --> 37:28.514
That was rock bottom for me.

37:28.548 --> 37:30.950
I swore I'd never take
another drink,

37:30.984 --> 37:32.184
and I haven't, Myka.

37:32.218 --> 37:33.385
I haven't taken any.

37:33.419 --> 37:36.221
I know. I know.

37:36.255 --> 37:39.057
Pete, I think it's working.

37:39.092 --> 37:41.560
All right.

37:41.594 --> 37:44.129
I could have killed my friend.

37:44.163 --> 37:46.531
I've never been able
to forgive myself.

37:46.566 --> 37:50.135
Just listen to me, okay?

37:50.169 --> 37:52.470
You have come

37:52.505 --> 37:55.307
so far since then, okay?

37:55.341 --> 37:59.411
You are a completely
different person now.

37:59.445 --> 38:03.048
It took real guts
to tell me that.

38:03.082 --> 38:06.551
I think you've got all
the testosterone that you need.

38:06.586 --> 38:09.054
- You think so?
- I do.

38:15.528 --> 38:16.828
So no more seizures?

38:16.863 --> 38:19.131
No. Artie caught the guy
who was doing this to you.

38:19.165 --> 38:21.500
We think maybe you ran into him
panhandling or something.

38:21.534 --> 38:24.536
So no more seizures,
no more visions.

38:24.570 --> 38:25.837
Huh?

38:25.872 --> 38:27.339
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:27.373 --> 38:29.441
Uh, thanks.
I mean, you're awesome.

38:29.475 --> 38:31.944
You saved my life,
so, you know, I owe you.

38:31.978 --> 38:33.412
Oh, no, come on, it's my job.

38:33.446 --> 38:35.347
So can I go now?

38:35.382 --> 38:37.216
Yeah.
I mean, I guess.

38:41.421 --> 38:43.288
You're not gonna call
social services?

38:43.323 --> 38:46.091
Well, like you said,
we don't really do that,

38:46.125 --> 38:48.460
and I would never do that,
but where are you gonna go?

38:48.494 --> 38:49.995
I don't know.
I'll figure it out.

38:50.029 --> 38:52.431
Wait.
It's just that...

38:56.103 --> 38:59.605
Why don't you come back
to South Dakota with us?

38:59.639 --> 39:02.474
South Dakota?

39:02.509 --> 39:04.977
- Why would I do that?
- Just for a couple days...

39:05.011 --> 39:07.646
so we can monitor
whatever the residual effects

39:07.680 --> 39:09.481
of this might be,
and then when we're done,

39:09.515 --> 39:11.716
we'll fly you back to wherever
you want to go to start over.

39:11.751 --> 39:12.984
Eh, I don't know.

39:13.019 --> 39:14.586
Sounds like a trap
to put me in foster care

39:14.620 --> 39:16.321
someplace really far
where I can't run away.

39:16.355 --> 39:17.989
Well, that's
a good idea, but, no.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.424
And I think
I've earned a little trust

39:20.459 --> 39:22.226
at this point, haven't I?

39:22.260 --> 39:26.163
Look, Nick,
I know the worst part

39:26.197 --> 39:29.933
about where you are right now is
that feeling that nobody cares.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.170
So why don't you let me
pay forward

39:34.204 --> 39:36.539
what was done for me?

39:40.644 --> 39:42.344
Yeah, I guess
we can give that a shot.

39:42.379 --> 39:45.248
Yeah?
Great.

39:45.282 --> 39:47.224
It'll... it'll be fun.
You'll like it.

39:56.869 --> 39:57.936
What's that?

39:57.970 --> 40:01.872
Oh, this is, uh,
one of my photographs.

40:01.907 --> 40:03.236
I thought I'd share it
with everyone.

40:03.295 --> 40:04.915
- Taking your own advice.
- Yeah.

40:04.996 --> 40:06.157
Well done.

40:10.064 --> 40:11.131
Hello?

40:11.165 --> 40:12.666
- Hey.
- Abigail, hey.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.702
Hi.
Welcome home.

40:14.736 --> 40:17.672
So, uh, we heard you
had to flush out the gooery.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.106
That's a bummer, huh?

40:19.141 --> 40:20.141
Did it barf on you?

40:20.175 --> 40:21.642
Because I cried
when it barfed on me.

40:21.677 --> 40:22.610
She did.

40:22.644 --> 40:24.678
Actually, it barfed on Steve.

40:24.713 --> 40:26.113
- Ooh.
- What?

40:26.148 --> 40:28.783
What?

40:28.817 --> 40:30.652
What is that wonderful smell?

40:30.686 --> 40:32.853
- Hello. Ah.
- Hey.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.889
- Hey, guys.
- Hi. Welcome back.

40:34.923 --> 40:35.923
Hi.
Nice welcoming party.

40:35.958 --> 40:36.958
How's everybody?
What's going on?

40:36.992 --> 40:38.393
- We just got home too.
- Oh.

40:38.427 --> 40:40.962
Pete, Myka, Abigail,
this is Nick.

40:40.996 --> 40:42.697
Nick. Hey.
How's it going, man?

40:42.732 --> 40:45.367
- Hi.
- This is a lot of people.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.269
Nick is just
between places right now,

40:47.303 --> 40:49.537
so I convinced Artie to let him
stay for a couple of days.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.540
After all, this is a B&B,
and where is my Steve?

40:51.574 --> 40:53.141
And what
is that wonderful smell?

40:53.176 --> 40:54.309
I know, right?

40:54.344 --> 40:56.645
That is Steve.
He is cooking.

40:56.679 --> 40:58.180
What?
I knew he could cook.

40:58.214 --> 40:59.248
Score.

40:59.282 --> 41:00.816
Oh, the man is full
of surprises.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.885
Come on,
I'll show you your room.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.469
So how was Ohio?

41:05.540 --> 41:07.946
Oh, you know, it was...

41:08.071 --> 41:09.202
the usual...

41:09.393 --> 41:11.661
snag, bag, tag.

41:11.695 --> 41:14.130
Oh. Good.

41:14.165 --> 41:15.164
Good... ooh.

41:15.199 --> 41:16.533
What is that?

41:16.567 --> 41:20.537
I-I took that photo
while I was traveling.

41:20.571 --> 41:21.772
- Oh.
- Beautiful.

41:21.806 --> 41:23.073
Look at you
with the hidden talent.

41:23.107 --> 41:24.641
Yeah, I was
just gonna put it upstairs.

41:24.675 --> 41:25.908
- No.
- Leave it here.

41:25.943 --> 41:28.011
- Leave it.
- It's cool.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.015
- Oh.
- Is that lasagna?

41:32.050 --> 41:34.852
- Oh, that looks so...
- Lasagna?

41:34.886 --> 41:36.020
Can I have some?

41:36.054 --> 41:37.955
So, Steve-O,
how'd your physical go?

41:37.990 --> 41:40.358
It turns out I am gay.

41:40.392 --> 41:42.793
- Mykes, when's your physical?
- Don't eat it all!

41:42.828 --> 41:44.328
Mine's coming up this week.

41:44.363 --> 41:45.597
Okay.

41:45.631 --> 41:47.699
There's lots.
There's lots, Artie... plenty.

42:02.616 --> 42:06.719
The doctor
will see you now, Ms. Bering.

42:15.890 --> 42:17.857
Myka.

42:18.063 --> 42:19.797
Myka...

42:19.832 --> 42:21.633
Did you hear what I said?

42:21.667 --> 42:25.136
I said we could be looking
at ovarian cancer.

42:25.170 --> 42:29.143
I think we should discuss
treatment options, Myka.
