02:55.441 --> 02:58.388
It took a while
for it to get down.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.821
Ready?

03:03.416 --> 03:05.157
Good catch.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.558
Wow!

03:07.620 --> 03:09.600
You threw it over my head.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.927
Okay, here we go.
I got it.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.797
Catch it.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.270
Good catch.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.868
All right. That's it.
That's how you do it.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.882
You watching?
Now go just like this.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.945
"And so the cowboys sat down

03:28.208 --> 03:30.882
by the crackling campfire
they had prepared."

03:30.944 --> 03:34.448
And roasted marshmallows?

03:34.514 --> 03:36.460
And roasted marshmallows.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.258
And popped popcorn.

03:39.319 --> 03:42.459
And popped popcorn.
That's right.

03:42.522 --> 03:43.694
And roasted hot dogs!

03:43.823 --> 03:46.633
And roasted hot dogs!
How did you know that?

03:47.827 --> 03:51.297
Hey, Daddy, will you be home
in time for my birthday?

03:54.801 --> 03:56.974
I wouldn't miss it
for the world, sport.

04:01.774 --> 04:02.775
There you go, buddy.

04:32.538 --> 04:35.348
That's great, hon.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.751
I know you'll get it,

04:36.809 --> 04:38.652
salesman of the year for sure.

04:38.711 --> 04:41.385
Just wish you didn't have to
go on the road so much.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.634
I ordered the cake,

04:58.698 --> 05:00.678
and the balloons arrive
on Thursday.

05:15.548 --> 05:16.822
What time do you leave?

05:16.883 --> 05:18.294
<i>Just waiting for takeoff.<i/></i>

05:18.351 --> 05:22.026
Okay, well, we really need
to go on a trip, like, soon.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.432
<i>We will, I promise.<i/></i>

05:34.534 --> 05:36.741
And, honey, if you have time,

05:36.803 --> 05:40.012
can you pick up a space shuttle
souvenir for Bobby?

05:40.073 --> 05:41.313
<i>I will.<i/></i>

05:51.684 --> 05:52.856
You know what?

05:52.919 --> 05:54.796
I'm gonna let you go, okay?

06:03.529 --> 06:04.667
Have a safe flight.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.404
I'll call you when I get to Houston.

06:06.466 --> 06:07.536
- Okay.
- <i>I love you.<i/></i>

06:07.600 --> 06:09.580
I love you.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.842
Bobby!

06:18.711 --> 06:20.019
God.

06:20.079 --> 06:21.956
Got you.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.517
Okay.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.621
Here.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.566
The back door is always locked.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.832
I don't even understand
how he could have opened it.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.134
Well, you got lucky this time.

06:37.764 --> 06:38.799
Thank you.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.469
- We'll see you later.
- Thank you.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.437
Okay, sweetie.

06:43.438 --> 06:45.109
Hey, hon.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.447
Plane got in early.
I'll be there soon.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.453
Do you need me
to pick anything up?

06:49.509 --> 06:51.511
No. Just get home.
We've missed you.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.022
How's my little guy doing?

06:53.079 --> 06:55.491
I just put him to bed
a little while ago.

06:55.548 --> 06:56.686
You know, I'm starting to think

06:56.749 --> 06:58.422
that you went out of town
on purpose.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.556
Prepping a five-year-old's
birthday party isn't easy.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.897
What'd the doctor say?

07:03.956 --> 07:06.493
He's fine. He's fine.
He just swallowed some water.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.766
Are we sure that was a dog?

07:08.828 --> 07:10.432
Maybe it was a coyote.

07:10.496 --> 07:13.443
They've been seen a lot
in the neighbourhood lately.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.638
All I can tell you
is it saved Bobby's life.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.511
After the 18th,

07:18.571 --> 07:20.949
no more out-of-town meetings
for a while.

07:21.007 --> 07:24.147
Really?
That's great news.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.986
I don't like it
when you go out of town,

07:27.046 --> 07:28.992
and Bobby needs his father around.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.028
I get lonely when you're away.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.698
Things are going to change, hon.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.700
Hey, I'll see you in 20.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.429
Bye.

08:09.589 --> 08:11.500
Well, Bobby,

08:11.557 --> 08:13.594
tell me how you feel.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.897
I'll be right back, Bobby.

08:43.688 --> 08:48.160
Well, it seems that Bobby
has acquired acute agoraphobia.

08:48.227 --> 08:49.638
What is that?

08:49.695 --> 08:52.676
It's a serious anxiety condition

08:52.732 --> 08:56.680
that can affect the way
in which a child or an adult

08:56.736 --> 09:01.207
deals with everyday, normal
social activities and interaction.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.515
In Bobby's case,

09:03.576 --> 09:07.285
it was undoubtedly triggered
by the loss of his father.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.788
He has been acting like that

09:09.849 --> 09:12.591
ever since Jack died.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.729
Hey...

09:48.788 --> 09:51.098
Why don't you show me
one of those magic tricks

09:51.157 --> 09:53.000
that Dr. Abernack taught you?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.969
Okay.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.113
Wow!

10:10.176 --> 10:11.712
Where did it go?

10:11.777 --> 10:13.779
That was so good.

10:13.846 --> 10:16.759
It's magic.
That was good.

10:33.766 --> 10:37.145
Well, you're not a coyote,
are you?

10:38.638 --> 10:39.810
Can we keep him?

10:41.240 --> 10:44.949
Well, he doesn't seem
to have a name tag.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.389
It's just this... this old key.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.388
Does it unlock something?

10:49.649 --> 10:50.649
I don't know.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.627
Be careful, sweetie.
We don't know if he's friendly.

10:55.688 --> 10:59.033
Oswald. His name is Oswald.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.695
Ozzy. Heh.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.672
- He seems friendly.

11:05.431 --> 11:08.878
Well, honey,
don't get too attached.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.242
He might belong
to somebody else.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.872
He might be missing.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.197
This little guy,

12:00.252 --> 12:04.200
he's going to help Bobby...

12:05.458 --> 12:06.937
control his agoraphobia.

12:06.992 --> 12:10.371
Dogs are amazingly
spiritual animals.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.103
They've been assisting people
with medical conditions

12:13.165 --> 12:14.337
for centuries now.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.815
One might even call them
magical. Heh heh.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.317
He still has anxieties
about socializing.

12:21.373 --> 12:24.752
The dog has become
his security blanket,

12:24.810 --> 12:26.448
his confidant.

12:26.512 --> 12:31.860
So Ozzy's going to bring him out
into the world and not be afraid.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.898
May I help you?

12:42.962 --> 12:45.067
I've come to retrieve my dog.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.912
Your... your dog?

12:48.968 --> 12:49.969
You're Ozzy's owner?

12:50.035 --> 12:52.811
Yes. Troublesome little creature.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.113
He escaped from his dwellings.

12:55.174 --> 12:58.053
Well, it's been quite some time.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.316
After a few months,

12:59.378 --> 13:01.289
we figured he didn't have a home.

13:01.347 --> 13:04.089
Why didn't you contact us sooner?

13:04.150 --> 13:06.096
I live far away,

13:06.152 --> 13:07.392
quite far.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.960
Bobby has become
pretty attached to this dog.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.026
I, I...

13:16.462 --> 13:18.533
I would like to see
my dog, please.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.176
Do you have anything
that you can show me

13:21.233 --> 13:23.770
that, that he is your dog?

13:23.836 --> 13:26.544
How did... how did you
get this address?

13:26.806 --> 13:29.912
We only put our phone number
on the poster.

13:33.512 --> 13:36.493
911. There's a man trying
to break into my house.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.549
Bobby, stay in your room!

13:37.550 --> 13:39.291
Close the door!

14:56.896 --> 14:57.897
Darn.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.605
One day, I'm going to be
the greatest magician in the world.

15:11.343 --> 15:14.347
Ozzy, pick a card.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.231
We'll shuffle.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.037
Is this your card?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.546
Thank you. Thank you.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.918
Another few weeks, please?

15:43.175 --> 15:45.155
I know my payment is late.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.156
Please, can't you extend
the grace period?

15:47.212 --> 15:50.022
I've never been delinquent
on my mortgage before.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.298
I recently lost my job,

15:54.353 --> 15:56.424
and my husband...

15:56.488 --> 15:57.990
passed...

15:59.191 --> 16:02.104
several years ago.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.664
I've managed this long.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.636
Please, just another few weeks?

16:20.446 --> 16:21.516
Come on. Let's go.

16:21.580 --> 16:22.580
Come on, Ozzy.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.288
Okay, be good. Have fun.

16:43.068 --> 16:45.048
Hey, can we pet your service dog,
you little wuss?

16:46.171 --> 16:49.482
Hey, leave him alone.
Pick on someone your own size.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.282
Are you his girlfriend?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.414
Are those your girlfriends?

16:55.581 --> 16:58.027
Hey, give me back my backpack.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.492
Give it... give it to me!

17:05.223 --> 17:06.328
Come on.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.770
Give it back!

17:15.467 --> 17:18.743
Throw something at me again,
and you're dead meat.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.750
Leave him alone!

17:22.407 --> 17:23.715
Let's get out of here.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.264
Help.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.271
Help me, please.

17:43.328 --> 17:45.638
Ozzy. Call somebody?

17:56.175 --> 17:57.175
Hi.

17:57.176 --> 17:58.348
Hi. What can I get for you?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.410
Can I have a milkshake?

17:59.445 --> 18:00.583
Sure. What kind?

18:00.646 --> 18:02.353
- Chocolate.
- Okay.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.757
Thanks.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.265
Hey, kid!
No dogs allowed.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.502
But he's my service dog, sir.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.774
I don't care if he's the First Dog
of the United States.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.468
Get that dog out of here now!

18:25.170 --> 18:26.774
Are you listening to me?!

18:26.839 --> 18:28.375
What's the matter with you, kid?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.386
Get that dog out of here now!

18:30.442 --> 18:34.390
But he helps me for...
for medical reasons.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.153
You don't look handicapped to me.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.620
He's my companion.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.294
He's licensed to go everywhere
with me.

18:40.352 --> 18:42.298
I don't care if he has
a license to drive.

18:42.354 --> 18:45.494
Get that mutt out of here.
Now!

18:46.692 --> 18:48.638
Come on, Ozzy.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.537
Tiny, do that again,
and you're fired.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.686
Thanks for calming me down,
Ozzy.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.884
Sorry. No lunch scraps.

19:10.149 --> 19:14.461
Well, we better be
getting home soon.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.727
Mom's going to be
looking for us.

19:16.788 --> 19:17.788
Come on, Ozzy.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.255
$20 bill?

20:06.305 --> 20:07.875
Aww. What a cute dog.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.544
- Can I pet him?
- Sure.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.654
Is he a working dog?

20:13.712 --> 20:16.556
He helps me leave the house.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.390
He's my best friend.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.877
How'd that get there?

21:17.776 --> 21:19.847
Whoa.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
What is this?

21:31.957 --> 21:35.598
Could you please tell me
how much the book is?

21:37.062 --> 21:39.508
Not sure I have enough money.

21:40.899 --> 21:42.037
$20.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.577
That's exactly how much I have.

21:47.673 --> 21:48.845
Thanks.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.412
Come on, Ozzy.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.807
It's locked.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.110
I can't open it.

23:30.175 --> 23:31.779
Looks like it needs
some kind of...

23:32.878 --> 23:35.051
key or something.

23:48.693 --> 23:49.693
No, it...

23:49.694 --> 23:51.935
it couldn't be.

24:22.727 --> 24:25.765
İt... it's not in English.

24:37.175 --> 24:41.749
One day, I'll be the greatest
magician ever,

24:41.813 --> 24:46.489
and then we can
take over the world.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.766
I...

24:56.995 --> 24:58.474
Sorry.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.844
Did you see that?

25:32.564 --> 25:34.840
Abracadabra?

25:41.973 --> 25:43.213
How'd I do that?

26:36.695 --> 26:38.641
Hello, Bobby.

26:38.697 --> 26:39.971
Hello.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.236
Who are you?

26:43.301 --> 26:46.612
I'm Zazasphorous.

26:47.639 --> 26:49.243
And how do you know my name?

26:49.307 --> 26:52.777
I know all about you.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.023
This is Ozzy.

26:56.081 --> 26:58.322
I know.
He is a good animal.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.383
I miss him.

26:59.384 --> 27:01.625
You miss him?

27:01.686 --> 27:05.964
Well, I was once
his guardian and master,

27:06.024 --> 27:09.836
and now you are his master.

27:09.894 --> 27:12.067
I don't understand.

27:13.665 --> 27:17.613
I sent Pharsophrises,
Ozzy as you call him now,

27:17.669 --> 27:19.740
to protect you.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.248
To protect me?

27:21.306 --> 27:24.651
All these years,
he has watched over you.

27:24.709 --> 27:28.919
He has been your guardian
since you were quite young.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.859
He has protected you from harm.

27:32.984 --> 27:37.330
And now you
must protect the book.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.063
Protect the book?

27:40.125 --> 27:43.368
The book should never
be used for evil.

27:43.428 --> 27:44.702
Why me?

27:44.763 --> 27:47.869
It has always been your destiny,

27:48.099 --> 27:50.306
and now that you
have turned the key,

27:50.368 --> 27:53.815
you have the power.

27:53.872 --> 27:56.682
You are the chosen one.

27:56.741 --> 28:00.211
Wait. What do you mean
I'm the chosen one?

28:02.313 --> 28:04.725
Did that just happen?

28:08.386 --> 28:10.059
Abracadabra!

28:15.026 --> 28:16.164
Yeah, right.

28:16.227 --> 28:18.332
I have the power.

28:18.396 --> 28:22.208
"You are the chosen one."

28:22.267 --> 28:24.076
I'm hallucinating.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.992
How did I do that?

28:48.226 --> 28:51.833
You are the chosen one.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.204
Who said that?!

28:53.264 --> 28:55.801
Me, Four Legs,

28:55.867 --> 28:57.244
Pharsophrises,

28:57.302 --> 28:59.248
as the old wizard calls me.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.181
But I prefer Ozzy.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.185
Dogs don't talk.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.777
Y... you can't talk.

29:05.877 --> 29:07.857
Well, if you can talk,

29:07.912 --> 29:09.448
why didn't you talk before?

29:09.514 --> 29:10.857
I had nothing to say.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.794
Actually,
until you opened the book,

29:13.852 --> 29:15.923
I was silenced for centuries.

29:15.987 --> 29:17.762
You've been around
for centuries?

29:17.822 --> 29:19.028
How old are you?

29:19.090 --> 29:21.161
623 years old.

29:21.226 --> 29:27.040
That's about 4,200 in dog years.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.236
This is unbelievable.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.745
You can talk!

29:30.802 --> 29:33.078
Now, got to keep this quiet.

29:33.138 --> 29:34.138
You understand?

29:34.139 --> 29:35.982
I understand.

29:39.911 --> 29:42.790
This is amazing!

29:45.483 --> 29:48.293
Still can't read this.

29:48.353 --> 29:51.425
It's in some kind of foreign
language or something.

29:51.489 --> 29:55.369
It's a magical book.
You don't need to read it.

29:55.426 --> 29:58.270
The magic you believe
is now the magic you create.

29:58.329 --> 29:59.399
Really?

29:59.464 --> 30:00.875
You have opened
the magic connection

30:00.932 --> 30:02.934
between the book and the key.

30:03.001 --> 30:06.471
As long as they remain with you,
you have the power.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.296
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.461
What are you and Ozzy up to?

30:27.525 --> 30:28.868
Nothing.

30:28.927 --> 30:30.065
I've been meaning to remind you.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.005
Don't leave the lights on
in the hallway during the clay.

30:32.063 --> 30:34.942
- It costs money.
- Sure.

30:59.090 --> 31:02.333
I could have sworn I put that quiche
in the oven a minute ago.

31:40.164 --> 31:41.507
Ozzy, let's get out of here.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.385
Your dog helping you
with your schoolwork again, dork?

31:51.242 --> 31:52.550
He's talking to you.

31:52.610 --> 31:56.057
Come on.
You listening to me?

31:57.282 --> 31:58.659
Over here.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.397
How'd you get over there?

32:06.457 --> 32:07.527
Whuh.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.383
It's in English now.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.112
It's actually not.

32:23.174 --> 32:25.950
You're able to see the words
in English.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.990
How come I can read them now?

32:28.046 --> 32:29.320
Because you have the power.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.053
The book has accepted you.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.152
You are its protector.

32:33.217 --> 32:34.924
Protector of what?

32:34.986 --> 32:38.593
You must protect the book
to protect the world!

32:38.656 --> 32:40.260
Protect the world?

32:40.325 --> 32:43.329
There is much evil
that starves for this book,

32:43.394 --> 32:47.536
evil that will feed off
the power of this book,

32:47.598 --> 32:52.172
evil that can destroy your world
as you know it.

32:53.338 --> 32:57.013
To protect the world
as you know it.

32:58.443 --> 33:02.414
And remember
to keep the key close to you

33:02.480 --> 33:04.687
at all times.

33:07.085 --> 33:09.588
Wait. What evil? Who?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.498
Come on, Ozzy. Come on.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.009
- Thanks, Mom.
- Have fun.

33:21.065 --> 33:22.442
I'll pick you up after the movie, okay?

33:22.500 --> 33:23.535
Okay.

33:23.601 --> 33:24.722
And no popcorn for Ozzy.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.046
- No popcorn for Ozzy?
- Shh! Come on.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.544
I've been wanting
to see this movie so bad.

33:33.611 --> 33:35.386
It's all about magic and wizards.

33:57.735 --> 34:00.682
That looks like our book.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.422
It's Lord Gargheon.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.078
Wow.
This is the best 3-D ever.

34:39.143 --> 34:40.746
Ozzy, we got to
get out of here now.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.120
You are the chosen one.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.255
Bobby, what are you doing?

35:21.319 --> 35:23.663
I'm not gonna be bullied anymore.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.864
Let's see what this magic can do.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.710
You have the power.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.555
Come on, Ozzy.

36:31.556 --> 36:37.563
The evil wizard is now very old
and losing his powers.

36:37.695 --> 36:41.871
He needs the book to stop aging
and regain his powers,

36:41.933 --> 36:43.742
or he will be back,

36:43.801 --> 36:45.405
and he wants the book.

36:45.469 --> 36:47.574
He needs the book.

36:47.638 --> 36:50.619
Maybe I should just give it to him.

36:50.675 --> 36:52.416
No. No, no.

36:52.476 --> 36:56.424
The book must never get
into the hands of the evil one.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.255
And if it does?

36:58.316 --> 37:00.193
The world will be in danger.

37:01.352 --> 37:03.491
Magic is like fire.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.728
In the right hands,
it can do nothing but good.

37:06.791 --> 37:09.499
But in the wrong hands,

37:09.560 --> 37:13.269
the hands of evil,
it can do nothing but bad,

37:13.331 --> 37:15.641
it can only destroy.

37:17.301 --> 37:19.338
If the Lord Gargheon comes back,

37:19.403 --> 37:23.909
you must destroy the book.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.414
What happens if the book
is destroyed?

37:27.478 --> 37:30.652
Then neither good nor evil
can use the magic.

37:32.316 --> 37:34.227
I'll lose all my powers
to do magic?

37:34.285 --> 37:37.323
Magic fuelled by the book, yes.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.936
You need to enter
the school talent show.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.943
- Why? - It will help you
get over your social anxiety.

37:47.999 --> 37:51.276
That's what you're for.
You help me do that.

37:51.335 --> 37:54.782
And I'm helping you by telling you
to enter the school talent show.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.678
I'm scared.

37:57.742 --> 37:58.743
Of what?

37:58.809 --> 38:00.311
You know I don't like crowds.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.289
That's why you have me.

38:02.346 --> 38:05.691
Look, you're my best friend
in the whole world.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.492
I wouldn't be able to get out of bed
if it weren't for you.

38:08.552 --> 38:12.329
You're going to be the greatest magician
in the world, remember?

38:13.824 --> 38:17.033
I guess it would be kind of fun
entertaining people.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.332
It's a great feeling
to make someone smile.

38:19.397 --> 38:21.809
You've got magic powers now, kid.

38:21.866 --> 38:24.005
Do you really think
we should enter?

38:24.068 --> 38:25.638
If you don't, I will.

38:30.741 --> 38:33.017
Hey, kid, what'd I tell you

38:33.077 --> 38:35.421
about bringing that dog
in here the last time?

38:37.615 --> 38:40.494
Abracadabra.
Do be tiny.

38:40.551 --> 38:42.997
What you trying,

38:43.054 --> 38:45.034
some hocus-pocus on me?

38:46.657 --> 38:49.536
What, what you do to me?

38:53.964 --> 38:55.637
Come on, Ozzy. Let's go.

38:55.700 --> 38:56.838
What'd you do to me, man?

38:56.901 --> 38:58.608
Where y'all goin...
Hey! Hey!

38:58.669 --> 39:00.149
You did not... Hey!
Hey, on the house,

39:00.338 --> 39:01.578
you could have a milkshake.

39:01.639 --> 39:03.380
You could have
some French fries.

39:03.441 --> 39:05.921
Just come back
and make me big again.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.717
I'm too insecure like this.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.622
I warned you, Tiny.
You're fired.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.491
I'm what?!

39:20.358 --> 39:22.668
You need to do
more prestidigitation.

39:22.727 --> 39:25.503
You mean like sleight of hand?
Close-up magic, right?

39:25.563 --> 39:27.406
Prestidigitation.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.968
But I can't seem
to pronounce it.

39:30.034 --> 39:34.346
Prestidigita-tation.

39:34.405 --> 39:35.475
Prestidigitation.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.950
Yeah, I know what you mean.

39:37.007 --> 39:39.009
You know, coin tricks,
card tricks,

39:39.076 --> 39:40.076
floating objects,

39:40.077 --> 39:42.079
swapping things under cups.

39:45.950 --> 39:49.898
Prestipaticipation.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.592
Artisticat...

39:51.655 --> 39:53.100
constipation.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.904
Prestidigitation.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.573
Yeah, I can do this.

40:04.635 --> 40:05.841
I can do this.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.049
I can't do this.

40:12.109 --> 40:14.783
Don't be nervous.
I'm here.

40:14.845 --> 40:15.845
And remember,

40:15.846 --> 40:17.985
nothing too spectacular.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.130
♪ Thump, thump goes my drums ♪

40:22.186 --> 40:26.464
♪ And the sound of my heart
when you're near ♪

40:26.524 --> 40:30.131
♪ Say, can you see ♪

40:30.194 --> 40:34.438
♪ By the dawn's early light ♪

40:47.578 --> 40:53.153
♪ And the home of the brave ♪

41:06.897 --> 41:08.968
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

41:09.033 --> 41:11.513
teachers and students.

41:11.569 --> 41:12.673
I'm the Great Bobbini,

41:12.736 --> 41:16.206
and this is
my trusty assistant Ozzy.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.190
Better wow them now,
or you've lost 'em.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.801
I thought you said
don't overdo it.

41:41.866 --> 41:43.539
I make mistakes.

41:48.672 --> 41:52.848
And now I shall make
my trusty assistant Ozzy disappear.

41:59.884 --> 42:01.864
Ozzy.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.159
And now for my final trick.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.932
Ozzy, please.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.851
That was great, wasn't it?

42:59.910 --> 43:02.015
- You were great.
- You were great.

43:02.079 --> 43:05.754
See, and the magic made you
come out of your shell.

43:05.816 --> 43:06.816
You weren't shy.

43:06.817 --> 43:08.660
Yeah, I guess it did.

43:08.719 --> 43:10.960
I just wanted to entertain everyone.

43:11.021 --> 43:12.967
How do we do that, anyway?

43:13.023 --> 43:16.027
A good magician never reveals
how he does a trick.

43:16.093 --> 43:17.766
Yeah, but I'm the magician.

43:17.828 --> 43:20.308
I should know
how l did the trick.

43:20.364 --> 43:23.777
When we get home, I'll show you
how we did the trick.

43:25.202 --> 43:28.149
This is how we did the trick.

44:26.230 --> 44:27.230
- Aww.
- Aww.

44:27.231 --> 44:29.233
So adorable.

44:40.344 --> 44:41.344
Hey!

44:41.378 --> 44:42.721
Hi.

44:42.780 --> 44:44.782
I love your dog.
He's so cute.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.088
Thanks.

44:46.150 --> 44:48.255
That was so cool
what you did back at school.

44:48.318 --> 44:50.423
Where did you learn how
to do magic like that?

44:50.688 --> 44:52.759
Friend of mine,
Dr. Abernack taught me.

44:52.823 --> 44:55.667
He said it'd help me
get over my shyness.

44:55.726 --> 45:00.038
I read once that Houdini and other
magicians were really very shy.

45:00.097 --> 45:01.371
Really?

45:07.805 --> 45:10.809
Bobby, there's some kids
at the door asking for you.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.447
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.851
They said they know you
from school.

45:18.916 --> 45:21.453
Hope they're not here
to beat me up.

45:23.420 --> 45:25.457
Hey, we thought
you'd like to join our team,

45:25.723 --> 45:28.135
come play baseball
at the park with us.

45:28.192 --> 45:30.229
Um, I don't know.

45:30.294 --> 45:32.174
You were great at the talent show
the other day.

45:32.229 --> 45:33.731
Yeah. How'd you do those tricks?

45:33.797 --> 45:36.471
A good magician never
reveals his secrets.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.214
Well, are you gonna
join our team or not?

45:39.269 --> 45:40.714
I don't... I don't know.

45:40.771 --> 45:43.809
Come on.
What are you afraid of?

45:45.109 --> 45:48.113
Okay. Let me go
get Ozzy's leash.

45:48.178 --> 45:50.089
We don't need that dog.

45:50.147 --> 45:52.787
He'll try and catch the ball.
He'll get in the way.

45:52.850 --> 45:53.851
No, he won't.

45:53.917 --> 45:55.055
He doesn't even chase balls.

45:55.119 --> 45:57.099
He's not like a regular dog.

45:57.154 --> 45:59.065
Can't you go anywhere
without him?

45:59.123 --> 46:01.364
Yeah. Leave him here.

46:01.425 --> 46:02.426
What's wrong with you?

46:02.493 --> 46:05.269
Come on, guys.
We don't need this kid.

46:05.329 --> 46:06.808
He's still a loser.

46:16.874 --> 46:19.445
But if I have all these powers,

46:19.510 --> 46:22.457
why can't I stop the foreclosure
on the house?

46:22.513 --> 46:26.051
Why can't I make money
just magically appear?

46:27.484 --> 46:29.930
And why can't I bring Dad back?

46:36.026 --> 46:37.471
It doesn't work that way.

46:37.528 --> 46:40.941
Magic doesn't solve problems.

46:40.998 --> 46:42.875
Then what does it do?

46:42.933 --> 46:46.540
Even I can't answer that, Bobby.
I'm sorry.

47:05.889 --> 47:07.459
Mom.

47:09.459 --> 47:10.459
What's wrong?

47:11.528 --> 47:12.563
I'm fine, sweetie.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.810
What are you doing up?

47:14.865 --> 47:16.435
Can't sleep.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.537
Thinking about Dad again?

47:18.602 --> 47:21.378
Yeah.

47:21.438 --> 47:23.941
Yeah, me, too.

47:24.007 --> 47:25.953
Why?

47:26.009 --> 47:27.989
It's okay, Mom.

47:28.045 --> 47:30.116
There's nothing we could've done.

47:36.019 --> 47:38.863
Hey, I'm real proud of you.

47:40.090 --> 47:42.536
My little Houdini.

47:42.593 --> 47:44.038
You were so great,

47:44.094 --> 47:46.540
you took home first prize.

47:46.597 --> 47:49.009
My little boy is gonna be
a great magician.

47:49.066 --> 47:50.477
Thanks.

47:52.502 --> 47:54.413
I'm so proud of you, honey.

47:54.471 --> 47:56.212
Now go to bed.

I swear.

48:49.293 --> 48:52.069

all you had to do was ask.

48:52.129 --> 48:53.972
I don't want you calling

Got it.

Make sure they didn't
forget the anchovies.

48:59.636 --> 49:00.944
What was that, honey?

49:01.004 --> 49:03.109
I just said,

49:03.173 --> 49:05.119
"Hope they didn't forget
the anchovies."

49:05.175 --> 49:06.984
Thanks for the pizza, Mom.

49:07.044 --> 49:08.523
Yeah, all right.

49:08.578 --> 49:10.649
Hurry. I'm starving.

We need to come up

50:06.370 --> 50:09.214
You're good with ideas.
You'll come up with something.

50:09.272 --> 50:11.081
Glad you have faith in me.

50:12.109 --> 50:13.349
Who are you talking to?

50:13.410 --> 50:14.650
You know, just, um,

50:14.711 --> 50:17.123
thinking out loud to myself.

50:17.180 --> 50:19.319
You doing your homework?

50:19.383 --> 50:20.987
I will. Just, you know,

some new magic tricks.

50:24.521 --> 50:27.092

50:33.230 --> 50:36.302
Now, homework first.

50:36.366 --> 50:37.366
I will. I promise.

50:37.367 --> 50:38.573
Get to it, kiddo.

50:38.635 --> 50:40.512
Your homework's
not gonna finish itself.

50:46.276 --> 50:48.654
Abracadabra, homework do.

We're looking for you to be

52:18.768 --> 52:21.578
Look, it's Gargheon. We gotta find
a way to stall him long enough

52:21.638 --> 52:23.447
to perform for the judges.
Come on.

52:46.029 --> 52:49.340
Ozzy, you're brilliant.

52:49.399 --> 52:50.469
I didn't say anything.

52:50.534 --> 52:52.411
You've given me a great idea.

52:52.469 --> 52:54.380
I have?

54:32.135 --> 54:34.136
These cards say who's next.
Yeah.

54:35.005 --> 54:36.678
Here we are.

54:36.740 --> 54:37.775
Hi.

54:37.841 --> 54:39.343
- Hi.
- All right.

54:39.409 --> 54:41.252
- Hello.
- How are you?

54:43.613 --> 54:47.254
Good evening,
ladies... and gentleman.

54:48.618 --> 54:51.030
I'm the Great Bobbini,

54:51.288 --> 54:53.461
and this is
my trusty assistant Ozzy.

55:05.902 --> 55:09.372
For my first trick, I shall...

55:11.007 --> 55:12.611
Just one...

55:12.676 --> 55:14.349
I'm not ready yet.

55:14.411 --> 55:16.618
Yes, you are.
Trust yourself.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.990
Do one of the tricks you designed
the other night.

55:19.049 --> 55:21.962
He's talking to his dog.
But does the dog talk back?

55:22.018 --> 55:23.827
That would be magic.

55:23.887 --> 55:25.867
Okay.

55:25.922 --> 55:28.596
Bobby and small furry person,

55:28.658 --> 55:30.729
what is it that you do exactly?

55:30.794 --> 55:31.794
We do magic.

55:31.795 --> 55:32.795
Ooh, magic.

55:32.796 --> 55:33.796
Great.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.935
- Abracadabra, we love it.
- Yeah.

55:35.999 --> 55:37.672
We want to be wowed.

55:54.117 --> 55:55.687
That's something.

55:55.752 --> 55:57.629
That's magic.

55:57.687 --> 55:59.860
Seems to be hovering.

55:59.923 --> 56:01.493
It's magic.

56:01.558 --> 56:03.119
What else do you have there,
little man?

56:16.840 --> 56:18.410
Where's the snow?

56:18.475 --> 56:19.579
Right.

56:23.146 --> 56:24.921
Just trying to find
something here.

56:31.755 --> 56:35.100
All right.
That was surprising.

56:35.158 --> 56:37.001
- Okay. All right.
- That's good. That's good.

56:38.528 --> 56:40.735
All right.
This must be the big one.

56:40.797 --> 56:42.367
This is the... This is big...

56:42.432 --> 56:43.433
This is the finale.

57:03.553 --> 57:04.691
Where'd the dog go?

57:04.754 --> 57:05.960
The dog is no longer there.

57:06.022 --> 57:08.059
- All right. And magic.
- That's very good.

57:08.124 --> 57:09.569
Magic!

57:09.626 --> 57:12.607
It's very cute, but I'm not sure
it's what we're looking for.

57:12.662 --> 57:15.643
And now,
I give you not only a trunk,

57:15.698 --> 57:18.042
but the elephant that comes with it.

57:24.073 --> 57:25.984
All right.

57:27.010 --> 57:28.455
All right.

57:28.511 --> 57:30.047
That's pretty cool.

57:30.113 --> 57:31.888
- Thanks, Bobby.
- Not at all.

57:31.948 --> 57:33.859
However, we have seen
this one before.

57:33.917 --> 57:36.454
It's sort of like a circus trick.

57:36.519 --> 57:40.092
Not sure if you have anything else
that we haven't seen, perhaps.

57:40.156 --> 57:42.932
Hey, Ozzy, the judges say
they've seen this before.

57:42.992 --> 57:45.495
How 'bout we show 'em
something they haven't seen?

57:50.700 --> 57:52.145
- Oh.
- Oh, my.

57:52.202 --> 57:54.011
That is a large canine.

57:54.070 --> 57:55.070
- Yeah.

57:55.071 --> 57:57.051
- W... wow.
- Wow.

57:57.106 --> 57:58.642
That's magic.

57:58.708 --> 57:59.743
How did he do that?

57:59.809 --> 58:00.879
We have not seen that.

58:00.944 --> 58:02.184
No, we haven't seen that.

58:02.245 --> 58:03.724
Must be some mirrors...

58:03.780 --> 58:05.851
Or a giant dog costume?

58:05.915 --> 58:06.915
- Smoke or...

58:06.916 --> 58:08.020
- Very well done, Bobby.

58:08.084 --> 58:09.757
- Very well done.
- That was very good.

58:09.819 --> 58:11.196
- Come up here.
Congratulations, Bobby.

58:11.254 --> 58:12.756
You're moving on
to the next round.

58:12.822 --> 58:14.665
We'll see you in Vegas.

58:14.724 --> 58:16.169
Congratulations, Bobby.

58:16.226 --> 58:17.705
See you in Vegas, Bobby.

58:19.629 --> 58:21.870
That, that's the only magician
we're going to let in.

58:21.931 --> 58:22.931
Okay.

58:24.934 --> 58:26.880
Me and Ozzy have a plan

58:26.936 --> 58:29.212
so that we don't lose the house.

58:29.272 --> 58:31.775
We're not losing the house.

58:31.841 --> 58:34.515
What gave you that idea?

58:34.577 --> 58:36.523
Everything's fine.

58:50.793 --> 58:51.999
Go. Go.

58:56.032 --> 58:58.569
How we going to get
to the callbacks?

58:58.635 --> 59:00.706
They're 600 miles or more
from here.

59:00.770 --> 59:02.113
They gave you a plane ticket.

59:02.171 --> 59:03.331
We can't let Mom know

59:03.540 --> 59:04.814
we're trying to save the house.

59:04.874 --> 59:06.217
It's supposed to be
a surprise, remember?

59:06.276 --> 59:08.688
Then you need
to create a portal.

59:10.079 --> 59:11.149
A por-tal?

59:11.214 --> 59:13.057
An entrance
we can step through here

59:13.116 --> 59:15.289
that brings us out there.

59:15.552 --> 59:16.895
You mean like that time

59:16.953 --> 59:19.593
when you went in one box
and out the other?

59:19.656 --> 59:20.794
Exactly.

59:22.759 --> 59:24.568
How 'bout a toilet?

59:24.627 --> 59:26.573
Everybody's got a toilet, right?

59:26.629 --> 59:28.870
I guess that would work. Heh.

59:28.932 --> 59:31.139
It would be like a portal potty.

59:34.704 --> 59:36.206
That could get messy.

59:36.272 --> 59:39.185
I think your bedroom closet
would work just fine.

59:40.877 --> 59:43.790
- Should we test it?
- Of course, to be sure it works.

59:45.648 --> 59:47.127
Okay.

59:48.217 --> 59:49.287
On with the show.

59:49.352 --> 59:50.854
Let's see where I go.

59:53.089 --> 59:55.797
Step through,
and see where it takes you.

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:04.645
I think it works.

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:13.787
We're gonna be late.
Hurry, Ozzy.

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:16.619
What time are the callbacks
for the audition?

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.352
Less than an hour. We...

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.891
I need time to get changed,

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.022
and then we have to make sure
that the portal is still working.

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:26.897
- Come on.
- Let's go.

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:28.256
Come on, Ozzy.

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:30.362
Come on.

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:43.050
Where is everybody?

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:53.783
This isn't the way home.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.852
We're going uptown.

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:02.393
Ozzy, we gotta get
off this bus now.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:23.817
Hand over the key
and take me to the book.

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:26.388
Now!

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.424
Bobby!

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.198
Look out.

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:56.320
Bobby!

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:59.087
Hold on.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:08.422
- Bobby. You okay?

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:10.395
We missed the callbacks
for the show.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:13.263
Now we'll never have a chance
to save the house.

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:16.895
We had our one chance,
and we missed it.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:22.170
I've got an idea.

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.837
Bobby, who are you talking to?

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:27.814
Just talking on my phone.

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:30.043
Well, don't be long.
It's expensive.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:31.141
I won't.

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.822
So what's your idea?

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:43.223
So we're gonna take
my toy steam engine back in time?

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:45.459
To the audition callbacks.

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:49.264
Look, it's one thing to step through
a portal to another place,

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.202
but to another time?

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.967
I can't do that kind of magic.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.475
Yes, you can, with my help.

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.067
Okay.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.912
Abracadabra.

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:04.316
Abracadabra.

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.044
Abracadabra.

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:09.220
It's not working.

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:12.191
- Try a rhyme.
- A rhyme?

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.827
I'm not good at rhymes.

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:22.491
I need to go back in time
to the audition...

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.231
Nothing rhymes with "audition."

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:29.105
We missed the audition.

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:30.906
We need to go back.

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:33.243
I can't do this.

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.248
I can't figure out
how to do this in rhyme.

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:38.183
Just wanted to go back in time.

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:42.115
Yes. I did it.

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:44.624
Yes!

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.761
Yeah!

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:54.096
Yeah! Yeah!

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:58.165
Yeah! All right!

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:12.078
Wait.
We're going backwards.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:15.247
Of course, silly.
We're going back in time,

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:16.915
not forward in time.

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:19.255
That makes sense.

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:38.135
Ozzy.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.679
Ozzy, wake up.
We're here.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.348
It's still nighttime.

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:44.214
Maybe the train took us
back to last night

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:47.083
so that we can get a good night's
sleep for the audition.

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.417
Let me check my phone.

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:52.619
I'm not getting any reception
on my cell phone.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:59.633
We went back too far,
way too far.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:02.602
Quick, think of a rhyme
to go forward,

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:04.069
forward in time.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.332
I had enough trouble

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:07.237
figuring out how to rhyme
the first time.

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:12.034
What rhymes with "forward"?

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.604
Augh. Nothing rhymes
with "forward."

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:18.314
On the train,
need to go forward.

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:20.320
Just take us away.
We don't want to stay.

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.200
Where are we?

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:43.404
I don't know.

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:50.142
We're still not in the present.

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:53.244
We're still seven years too early.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.016
We didn't go anywhere.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.420
This is our hometown newspaper.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.982
We're not in Vegas.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:06.361
- It's a $50 coupon.
- For what?

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:10.035
It's real.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:12.003
50 bucks.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:13.165
I'm hungry. You hungry?

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:15.573
I'm a dog.
I'm always hungry.

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:16.735
Let's go.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:20.236
Boy, I didn't realize
how hungry I was.

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:22.680
That dog was scrumptious.
What's for dessert?

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:24.615
We have to get back
to the train soon,

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.084
but I'm a little thirsty.

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:27.450
We should stop and get
something to drink.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.615
But we can't miss
the callbacks this time.

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:31.089
We gotta win.

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:33.184
Mom needs that money
to pay for the mortgage.

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:35.729
Otherwise, we're going
to be homeless.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.158
Come on, Ozzy.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.814
Excuse me.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.313
Are you sure
you're okay to drive?

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.779
What's it to you, kid?

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:10.256
Look, I don't think it's safe for you
to be driving right now, mister.

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:14.361
What's it your business
you telling me what to do?

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:17.461
Why don't you call a cab?

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:18.526
You harassing me?

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:21.234
I'm gonna call the cops.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:23.777
No. Look, I've got...

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.335
$30 left.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.143
That should be enough for a cab.

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.764
You're right, kid.

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:53.237
You really do care.
Someone does.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.702
I gotta go, mister.

01:08:57.765 --> 01:09:00.337
Thank you, kid.
Thanks, dog.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.245
Don't mention it.

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.188
Yeah, I need a cab.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.292
It was good to do a good deed.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:17.524
Ready to ride?

01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:22.635
We're still too early,
so take us on a trip,

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:26.502
seven more years.
Let's go. Zip, zip, zip.

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:50.157
Ozzy, we're here.

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:51.288
We made it.

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:51.680
I'm not sure...

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:53.454
Is this our Bobby that we liked?

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.620
Supposed to be magic, right?

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:01.594
Look, somethings wrong, okay?
I'm feeling a little weak.

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.603
Gargheon's got the key now.

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.935
It's taking away some of your power
from the book.

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:07.565
You need to concentrate.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:08.630
Try harder.

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.505
Okay.

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.342
Here we go.

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.275
Ta-da.

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:49.337
Heh.

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.011
All right. Well,

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.576
that might've been enough magic
for today, all right?

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:54.985
Thank you.

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.422
Please, just give me a chance.

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:01.052
Look, I can create an illusion
that no one has ever seen before.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.627
My sweet little magic man,

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:07.463
I'm going to tell you what I told
Jason Beiver

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.797
when I saw him perform

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.359
when he was just
seven years old.

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.734
- My.
- I said,

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:13.796
"Jason, you are like a bird

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.068
soaring through the air."

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.639
You're the bird.

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:17.700
Soaring high.

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:18.836
And that bird...

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:20.970
Has been shot.

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.674
- Right.
- Do you see?

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:24.081
And it falls, and it's just...

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.047
It's feathers now,
and it's just...

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:28.054
It's flailing about
all over the ground.

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:30.522
- It's really sad.
- It's not good.

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:32.525
Okay. But you have wings, Bobby.

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:34.322
Use them.

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:35.589
And never give up
on your dreams.

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:36.959
Your dreams, Bobby.

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:39.863
Thank you. Next.

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:47.400
There he was,
I mean, began the weeping.

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.841
Just the excessive
little display of feeling.

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.673
What is that?

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.441
It's the parents.
It's the grandparents.

01:12:54.503 --> 01:12:55.504
Excuse me! Wait!

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.117
It's our little magician.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:00.376
Yes, the dead bird.

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:03.446
Look, kid, I don't know
how to tell you this,

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.924
but you didn't make it, all right?

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.790
Perhaps if you work really hard,

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:10.387
you could perform at a casino
someday.

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:13.997
- Wait.
- Sorry.

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.729
Can't we talk this out?

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.670
Come on.
Just give me a chance.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.502
Wait!

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.441
Have you ever seen a dog
turn into a werewolf?

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.479
No.

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:42.127
All right, I have to admit
that was impressive,

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:45.393
but it's not even a full moon
or anything, so...

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:46.933
Yes. Yes.
You are absolutely right.

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:49.128
It is said that one
can only transform

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.829
in the light of a full moon.

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:53.737
An old tale has it
that the first werewolf

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:56.868
was spotted in a small-town village
in Eastern Europe.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:59.173
Legend has it that
the power of the full moon

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.039
caused the blood
of the would-be werewolves

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.083
to pump faster and harder,

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:04.640
forcing them to literally jump

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:06.913
out of their skins
to become the werewolf.

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:11.720
Please turn your attention
to the current crescent moon.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:15.455
Let's make the perfect night
for a werewolf, shall we?

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:29.464
How did...

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:33.003
You know, let's make it
a blue moon at that.

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.082
Are you seeing that?

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.846
Okay, this is really weird.

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.818
I'm not sure how to take that.

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.596
I don't know how...
That can't be rigged up.

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:43.715
All right, kid.
Congratulations.

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:45.884
You made it to the finals.

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.518
- Let's go.
- That's good.

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:48.653
Yes.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.128
Thank you, guys.

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:51.755
Congratulations.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.130
I'm proud of you, kid.

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:55.189
Thanks.

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:39.107
We're gonna be great
on the show, Oz.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.704
Oz? Ozzy?

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.044
Where are you?

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.913
Good.

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.889
Fridge needs some stocking.

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:11.243
Oz?

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.247
This isn't funny.

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:16.544
Hello, Bobby.

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:18.609
Weren't expecting me, were you?

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.258
How'd you get in here?

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.759
Your mother let me in.

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:28.158
No, she didn't.

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:30.196
Is my mom okay?

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.960
Mom? Mom?

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.763
She can't help you right now.

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:37.997
What did you do to my mom?

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.199
Where's Ozzy?

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.902
They're both a little petrified
at the moment.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:45.036
You'd better not hurt them.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:50.345
Now, I'm looking for the lock,
that fits this key.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.950
I'll never give you the book.

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:59.924
Then you'll never see
your mother and Ozzy again.

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:13.705
Bobby, now that I have the key,

01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:15.639
I absorb much of your power.

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:18.974
The closer I'm to the book,

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.741
the weaker you get,

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.645
the stronger I become.

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:29.121
I can feel the magic
draining from your veins.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:35.357
Now, big man,

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:38.296
give me the book.

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:41.334
You want the book?

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:46.702
You're not using the powers.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.070
How can you do that?

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.939
This is an illusion.

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:55.141
A good magician never reveals
how he does his tricks.

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:19.202
It's time to close this chapter.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.694
Ozzy?

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:48.858
Ozzy.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:52.167
You okay, Oz?

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.865
Oz?

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.341
Say something.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:00.042
Say something.

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:04.206
Say something!

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:11.857
Ozzy, I don't care
if you can't talk.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:13.756
I love you anyway.

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:15.761
Even before you could speak

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:19.788
or any of this strange
wizard stuff happened,

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:23.393
you were always the most
magical thing in my life.

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:27.528
Bobby?!

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.807
Bobby?!

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.205
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:38.217
I'm fine.
Ozzy's fine, too.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:42.050
The bad man left.
He won't be back.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:50.953
I no longer have the book
to sustain my energy.

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:54.091
I must go soon.

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:58.229
The book is safe now,

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.466
locked away forever,

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:02.406
thanks to you, Bobby.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:05.877
Well, I guess I'll never be
a great magician.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.914
You are a great magician.

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.448
How can you say that?

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:11.848
I don't have magical powers
anymore.

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:16.356
But you don't need otherworldly
powers to be a good magician.

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:18.413
Who designed those magic tricks?

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.790
You did.

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:22.886
Who performed them flawlessly?

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:24.396
You did.

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:27.331
Yeah, but I had help.

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:29.391
I can't do them by myself.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:32.529
Now I'll have to quit the show,
and we'll lose the house.

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:36.474
But what about all those
great illusions you did?

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:39.171
You created them from scratch.

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:41.373
The book didn't give you
those ideas.

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:44.417
Those ideas were yours
and yours alone.

01:20:44.472 --> 01:20:49.046
The magic is inside of you,
Bobby.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:28.315
We're not gonna make the final show
on time, even if we fly.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:36.191
The magic is inside of you, Bobby.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.060
Thanks, Zazasphorous.

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.629
It's "The Million Dollar Talent Show"

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:16.965
and here's your host,
Patrick Schweiss.

01:23:17.025 --> 01:23:18.299
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.080
welcome to
"The Million Dollar Talent Show".

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:22.369
Boy, have we got some great acts
for you tonight.

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.458
Our judges have picked
the final contestants.

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:28.038
Now it's up to you at home

and we'll announce

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.541

Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:28.570
I'm the Great Bobbini,

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:31.668
and this is
my trusty assistant Ozzy.

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:36.713
Today we'd like to do
some prestidigitation for you.

01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:38.580
Now, if you don't know
what that word means,

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.712
it means the art of close-up magic
using sleight of hand.

01:24:41.776 --> 01:24:44.416
And I can't tell you how long
it took me to pronounce that.

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:50.286
Mom, Dad, look.

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:52.490
My friend Bobby's on TV.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:56.695
All right.
Ozzy, pick a card.

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:59.136
Pick a card.

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:03.567
He's picked the jack of diamonds.

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:07.169
All right.

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:10.341
Would you kindly
hold up your sign?

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:16.249
Now, um, would you
please flip that over?

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:20.626
Thank you.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.700
And now for my final trick,

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:30.702
I shall be the first magician ever
to hypnotize an animal,

01:25:30.758 --> 01:25:33.102
my dog Ozzy.

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:41.741
Sit. Sit. Sit.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:47.446
Sit. Sit.

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:48.544
Whoo!

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:53.490
Sit. Thank you.

01:25:57.886 --> 01:25:59.160
Sit up.

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:03.569
Now, Ozzy,
I need you to concentrate.

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:07.670
Look into my eyes.

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.402
And the countdown...

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:16.573
Ozzy, I need you to concentrate,

01:26:16.638 --> 01:26:18.140
okay?

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:20.743
On the countdown from 3, 2, 1,

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:24.449
I want you to become
as still as a mannequin.

01:26:25.785 --> 01:26:26.926
3, 2, 1.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.556
Freeze.

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:03.724
Whenever Ozzy disappears,

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:06.322
I know how to make him reappear.

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:08.765
Ozzy, you want a cookie?

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:34.489
We had some great talent tonight.

01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:36.495
We had over
12 million votes online.

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.394
Our computers
have tallied them up.

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:41.297
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is live.

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:43.461
In third place, we have...

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.802
Jaycee.

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:57.242
And in second place, we have...

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:11.358
the Great Bobbini.

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:27.711
And your
million-dollar winner is...

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:29.680
the Dancing Dolls.

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:32.874
We didn't win.

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.783
And I know you'd probably say

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:37.823
that I came in second
and I did it all my own,

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:41.486
but that's not gonna
save the house.

01:29:02.036 --> 01:29:03.709
Making fun of me.

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:04.942
Making fun of me.

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:07.043
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Yeah.

01:29:07.044 --> 01:29:08.847
- Stop!
- Think I'm old?

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:10.912
I'll show you old.

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:14.050
Hey, buddy.

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:15.788
Hi.

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.022
Dad?

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:20.498
Yeah?

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:22.556
But...

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.035
- What's with the tux?
- How?

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.566
You...

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:31.104
Are you okay, Bobby?

01:29:34.418 --> 01:29:35.726
Dad.

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:42.579
Hey, I love you too, sport.

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:52.357
I can't believe it.

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.127
But how?

01:29:56.023 --> 01:30:01.974
You told me that magic couldn't
save Dad or the house,

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:03.838
but it did.

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:25.491
- Hello, Bobby.

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:29.896
- Hello, Ozzy.
- Zazasphorous?

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:32.437
But I thought
I'd never see you again.

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:35.736
I think you need to understand
what happened

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:40.007
and to know that you are the reason
your father is alive.

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:42.604
What do you mean?

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:44.047
There was a hiccup,

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:46.847
a delay in the time-space
continuum,

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:51.982
but your father is now alive
because of you.

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.855
- Bobby, you changed the future

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:32.489
by doing one simple good deed.

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:05.494
Nice.

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:42.157
Thanks for being there
for me, Oz,

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:45.261
after all those years.

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:47.533
I think I can do it
on my own now.

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:48.835
D..., don't worry, though.

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:50.933
You'll always, you know,
be my best friend,

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:54.810
but it's just not your job
anymore.

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.931
Bosloy's Pizzeria.
Can I help you?

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:23.806
I'd like to order
your colossal imperial pizza,

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:24.934
everything on it,

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:28.105
and don't forget the anchovies.

01:36:00.001 --> 01:36:01.501
The End

01:36:02.001 --> 01:36:06.001
