00:46.213 --> 00:48.881
(people laughing and chattering)

00:58.658 --> 01:01.793
(booing)

01:01.828 --> 01:03.829
(Henry): Enough already!

01:03.864 --> 01:06.165
- Let's have Bert Grady!
- Yeah!

01:06.199 --> 01:10.202
- BOO! Boo!
- Oh come on, Higgins. Don't...

01:12.839 --> 01:16.575
- Higgins! Oh, here we go.
- (Higgins laughing)

01:16.609 --> 01:18.877
People, please! Let's give a
hand to this fine young juggler,

01:18.911 --> 01:20.540
W.C. Fields! And now,

01:20.546 --> 01:23.849
- the funniest man in vaudeville...
- Bert Grady!

01:23.883 --> 01:27.552
- ... Bert Grady!
- (Cheering and whistling)

01:33.592 --> 01:36.494
- That was saucy. Very saucy.
- Bravo!

01:36.528 --> 01:39.059
I sat down next to a guy at
the tavern. A chatty type.

01:39.059 --> 01:41.393
He told me his mother-in-law was
an angel. I said, "Lucky you."

01:41.427 --> 01:43.462
Mine's still alive!"

01:43.496 --> 01:46.031
(laughing)

01:46.066 --> 01:48.099
But that's not entirely
true. I do have a soft spot

01:48.134 --> 01:51.069
for my mother-in-law. It's right
behind this theatre, in fact.

01:53.339 --> 01:55.641
I missed her at first,

01:55.675 --> 01:58.076
so I reloaded and tried again. That did it.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.679
Now, you can't blame me; she told me

02:00.713 --> 02:02.847
she always wanted to go down
under. I just didn't realize

02:02.882 --> 02:05.583
"down under" meant Australia
until it was too late.

02:05.617 --> 02:09.120
Now she's 6 feet under.

02:09.155 --> 02:11.289
Not that she cared for me much
either, though. She said that

02:11.323 --> 02:13.357
she was gonna dance on my
grave. I said that I hope you do,

02:13.392 --> 02:15.393
'cause I plan to be buried at sea.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.628
- (laughing loudly)
- (music striking up)

02:17.663 --> 02:22.166
Thank you all very much. Thank you.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.737
Thank you. (Whistling)

02:26.772 --> 02:29.973
Ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls! A round of applause

02:30.008 --> 02:32.843
if you think that, hmm...

02:32.877 --> 02:34.912
W.C. Fields should win

02:34.946 --> 02:37.480
- the audience prize!
- (Booing)

02:37.515 --> 02:40.150
- Really? What are you doing?
- I don't even have to ask,

02:40.185 --> 02:42.186
do I? Once again,

02:42.220 --> 02:45.355
the audience prize goes to...

02:45.389 --> 02:49.026
- ... Mr. Bert Grady!
- (George): He deserves it.

02:49.060 --> 02:52.762
(Henry): Yes he does.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.864
We should try to meet him this time.

02:54.898 --> 02:57.535
Actually, I had a
thought about that, Henry.

03:00.971 --> 03:03.406
I noticed last time that
Bert Grady didn't leave

03:03.441 --> 03:05.408
by the front doors with
the rest of the performers.

03:05.443 --> 03:07.610
he must have slipped out
this way to avoid the fanfare.

03:07.645 --> 03:11.547
- We should pitch him our jokes.
- No. They're not ready yet, Henry.

03:11.581 --> 03:14.416
What's this? I told you I don't want to be

03:14.451 --> 03:17.686
- pestered after shows.
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm sure

03:17.721 --> 03:19.688
if you sign an autograph
you can be on your way.

03:19.723 --> 03:22.391
Well? Pen and paper?

03:22.425 --> 03:25.627
Oh no, we're not like that. Uh,
we're fans, just not that kind.

03:25.662 --> 03:26.729
What the hell do you want then?

03:28.865 --> 03:30.799
- Hello.
- Oh...

03:30.914 --> 03:35.383
Better not be anyone here to
pester me tomorrow night, Lewis.

03:35.418 --> 03:37.419
- We need to say something funny, George.
- It's too late,

03:37.454 --> 03:39.421
- just let him go.
- Uh, Mr. Grady...

03:39.456 --> 03:41.790
- What now?
- (George): We just wanted you

03:41.825 --> 03:44.059
to know how much we enjoyed your monologue.

03:44.093 --> 03:47.795
And we've written some jokes
that we think you might like.

03:47.830 --> 03:51.466
Two constables are walking the
beat, and them one of them...

03:51.500 --> 03:54.269
I write my own jokes. Thank you.

03:54.303 --> 03:57.038
Thank you.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.742
It's not easy being the star.
Don't take it personally.

04:01.777 --> 04:03.911
- Oh, no, of course.
- Perhaps I can give you

04:03.946 --> 04:07.815
- a tour of the theatre?
- Yes, that would be terrific,

04:07.850 --> 04:10.818
- Mr...
- Lewis Hoffat. I'm the assistant manager to Mr. Allen

04:10.853 --> 04:14.489
here at the Bradley Theatre.
And I'd love to hear your jokes.

04:33.891 --> 04:36.693
(gun being cocked)

04:38.727 --> 04:40.363
What the hell are you doing here?

04:43.567 --> 04:44.700
Why?

04:44.803 --> 04:50.373
- (gun firing again)
- (groaning)

05:10.683 --> 05:14.819
- Good evening, Dr. Grace.
- Detective.

05:14.853 --> 05:18.356
The deceased appears to be
someone of some notoriety.

05:18.391 --> 05:20.725
If you like that type of thing.

05:20.759 --> 05:24.195
He died about an hour
ago, approximately 11 PM.

05:24.229 --> 05:26.564
Cause of death appears obvious enough.

05:26.598 --> 05:29.633
Following a post-mortem, I hope to
determine the calibre of the bullet.

05:29.668 --> 05:32.704
I suspect you'll find it was a .22.

05:32.738 --> 05:35.339
That's consistent with what I'm seeing.

05:35.373 --> 05:38.642
(Murdoch): Pockets are empty.

05:38.677 --> 05:41.212
No wallet, timepiece, keys...

05:41.246 --> 05:43.214
(Dr. Grace): A robbery.

05:43.248 --> 05:46.883
- That's a rather violent one, no?
- Were there any witnesses?

05:46.918 --> 05:49.653
Only one; a Miss Glenys
Moore, manager of the hotel.

05:49.688 --> 05:52.489
She overheard the deceased say,

05:52.524 --> 05:54.725
"What the hell are you doing here?"

05:54.759 --> 05:57.861
just prior to the gunshots,
but she didn't see the incident.

05:57.895 --> 06:00.330
- Then he knew his killer.
- Perhaps he was relieved

06:00.364 --> 06:02.766
of his valuables to imply a robbery.

06:09.173 --> 06:11.141
So Henry, what do you do if
you miss your mother-in-law?

06:11.175 --> 06:13.710
Why George, you reload and you try again!

06:13.744 --> 06:15.745
So I'm in a tavern and
a man next to me says,

06:15.779 --> 06:18.013
"My mother-in law's an
angel." And I said to him...

06:18.048 --> 06:20.116
"You're lucky, mine is still alive."

06:20.150 --> 06:23.753
- (Brackenreid): Oy! Shh!
- How did that one about the grave go?

06:23.787 --> 06:26.256
Uh, she never liked me
either, she said she was going

06:26.290 --> 06:30.126
- to dance on my grave, and I said...
- Henry, we should do our work.

06:32.763 --> 06:34.730
I said, "I hope you do, because
I plan to be buried at sea!"

06:34.765 --> 06:37.532
- ... buried at sea! Ha ha!
- What the hell are you two

06:37.567 --> 06:40.069
- cackling like school girls for?
- Oh, sir, it was

06:40.103 --> 06:42.071
a terrific show last night
at the Bradley Theatre.

06:42.105 --> 06:44.073
You were there? Shame about Bert Grady.

06:44.107 --> 06:47.442
- Uh, how do you mean, sir?
- He was gunned down after the show.

06:47.477 --> 06:51.313
I'm off to the theatre
with Murdoch as we speak.

06:51.347 --> 06:54.716
(George): I don't believe it!

06:58.988 --> 07:01.122
You know, I have soft spot

07:01.157 --> 07:03.091
- for my mother-in-law...
- Oh, Higgins! Come on, man!

07:03.125 --> 07:06.828
- It's just a joke, George.
- Well, he just died Henry! It's too early for jokes.

07:06.862 --> 07:09.063
Too early.

07:09.098 --> 07:13.134
(man humming indistinctly)

07:21.610 --> 07:24.178
It's a moment of silence for Mr. Grady.

07:30.118 --> 07:32.953
(making fart noise)

07:32.987 --> 07:35.222
- (all chuckling)
- (Mr. Allen): What?

07:35.312 --> 07:38.281
This some kind of a joke to you?

07:38.315 --> 07:42.385
Without Grady pulling in the
people, we might all be out of a job!

07:42.419 --> 07:44.754
Now look I know he was a son
of a bitch and some of you

07:44.788 --> 07:46.756
are glad to see that he's gone,

07:46.790 --> 07:48.791
but you better start to pull your weight.

07:48.825 --> 07:52.728
One of you sad sacks might actually
win the audience prize, now.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.598
So get back to work! You too, dummy.

07:57.901 --> 07:59.869
(Hoffat): Excuse me, sir...

07:59.903 --> 08:01.871
Detective Murdoch, Inspector Brackenreid

08:01.905 --> 08:05.674
of the Toronto Constabulary.
We'd like a word about Mr. Grady.

08:05.709 --> 08:08.878
We gave him a minute of silence,
that's all that Grady deserved.

08:08.912 --> 08:11.479
We'll be investigating with
or without your cooperation,

08:11.514 --> 08:13.581
Mr. Allen. It's to your
benefit that we have it.

08:13.616 --> 08:15.850
Well, what's to investigate here?

08:15.885 --> 08:18.053
The papers said it was a robbery.

08:18.087 --> 08:20.855
The robbery may have been staged to
hide the killer's true intentions.

08:20.890 --> 08:22.857
We have reason to believe that Mr. Grady

08:22.892 --> 08:25.927
- knew his attacker.
- We'll be speaking with all your employees.

08:25.961 --> 08:28.062
Is there anything you care
to tell us before they do?

08:28.096 --> 08:31.265
Sure. Everybody hated him.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.400
Make yourselves at home, gentlemen.

08:36.539 --> 08:39.140
(squirting)

08:43.211 --> 08:46.613
Ahem... Detective William
Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

08:46.648 --> 08:49.016
- And you are?
- Uh, Ed Ward.

08:49.051 --> 08:51.852
And your surname?

08:51.886 --> 08:54.488
- I've just told you.
- You told me your name

08:54.522 --> 08:56.690
- was Edward.
- That's right. Ed Ward.

08:56.724 --> 09:00.727
- Edward who?
- Ed Ward is my name.

09:00.762 --> 09:03.396
- Sir, I need your surname.
- OK, you have it.

09:03.431 --> 09:06.032
It's Ward. Ed Ward.

09:06.768 --> 09:09.503
- Ah.
- Hey, please, sit.

09:12.137 --> 09:13.656
(Ward laughing)

09:13.657 --> 09:15.456
Isn't that great?

09:15.740 --> 09:19.342
That is my flatulence sack,
sir. Kids love this thing.

09:20.777 --> 09:24.379
Mr. Grady performed as a monologist,

09:24.413 --> 09:26.391
the most challenging of
disciplines in vaudeville.

09:26.571 --> 09:28.672
Was there jealousy amongst the performers?

09:28.706 --> 09:30.674
Well, I mean, I suppose we respected

09:30.708 --> 09:32.909
his talent, just not the man himself.

09:32.943 --> 09:35.812
Was he resented for his success?

09:35.846 --> 09:39.916
Well, not by me. I'm considered the
best prop comedian in all of Vaud.

09:40.030 --> 09:43.065
What do you think this is?

09:43.100 --> 09:45.902
- A pole.
- Not just any pole;

09:45.936 --> 09:47.937
it's my 11-foot pole.

09:47.971 --> 09:50.940
For everything I wouldn't
touch with my 10-foot pole.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.312
Anything else?

10:00.950 --> 10:03.419
Looks like you need some practice. Catch!

10:05.689 --> 10:07.856
- W.C. Fields, is it?
- Yeah.

10:07.890 --> 10:10.058
And I'll be jumping the
first train back to the States

10:10.092 --> 10:12.460
once my contract's up. Audiences are...

10:12.494 --> 10:17.332
- ... more forgiving there.
- Mr. Fields, I believe that Mr. Grady

10:17.366 --> 10:19.334
pelted you with a tomato
on stage last night.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.369
Quite embarrassing, I would have thought.

10:21.403 --> 10:24.972
Vaudevillians are supposed
to look out for one another,

10:25.006 --> 10:27.041
- but not that man.
- I don't suppose

10:27.075 --> 10:29.977
that compelled you to seek
retribution after the show?

10:30.011 --> 10:33.147
Retribution? For what?

10:33.181 --> 10:35.483
Grady may have been a
louse, but he was right.

10:35.517 --> 10:37.518
I was horrible last night.

10:40.322 --> 10:42.723
- Yep...
- Ooh, ooh!

10:42.757 --> 10:45.059
Not as easy as it looks.

10:53.134 --> 10:56.103
I understand Mr. Grady had
been winning the audience prize.

10:56.137 --> 10:59.473
Yes. Ever since he became a
monologist three months ago.

10:59.507 --> 11:02.141
- What did he do prior to that?
- He was in a prop comic

11:02.176 --> 11:04.544
- two-act with Ed Ward.
- They were partners?

11:04.579 --> 11:06.847
Yes, until he went off to become a star.

11:06.881 --> 11:10.083
Mr. Ward has been unable
to match Grady's popularity.

11:21.695 --> 11:23.863
I'm glad to see you're putting
George's wedding present

11:23.898 --> 11:26.799
- to good use.
- And I'm happy to have a wife

11:26.833 --> 11:30.003
who's willing to accompany
me on my investigations.

11:30.037 --> 11:33.939
I'm actually quite excited about it. I
haven't seen a vaudeville show in ages.

11:33.973 --> 11:37.376
Oh, Julia, I'd be careful
to temper my expectations.

11:37.411 --> 11:41.480
I didn't find any of the performers
to be particularly amusing.

11:41.515 --> 11:45.317
You can hardly determine that from
meeting them in a murder investigation.

11:47.653 --> 11:50.522
What do you do with an 11-foot pole?

11:50.556 --> 11:52.791
I couldn't be sure.

11:52.825 --> 11:54.826
You use it to touch the objects

11:54.860 --> 11:59.197
you wouldn't otherwise
touch with a 10-foot pole.

11:59.232 --> 12:01.800
You see, that's the sort of

12:01.834 --> 12:04.135
humour that will be on
display this evening.

12:04.169 --> 12:06.137
Well, I'm looking forward to it

12:06.171 --> 12:08.673
all the same. And hopefully
you'll glean something

12:08.707 --> 12:10.842
for your investigation.

12:10.876 --> 12:13.177
Hmm. Bert Grady, a
monologist, had been routinely

12:13.211 --> 12:15.480
winning the audience prize. I wonder if

12:15.514 --> 12:19.083
one of the other performers
murdered him to supplant him

12:19.117 --> 12:21.752
- as the top act.
- It's possible.

12:21.786 --> 12:23.754
The combination of professional jealousy

12:23.788 --> 12:25.889
and monetary gain is reasonable motive.

12:27.892 --> 12:30.661
- Shall we, Doctor?
- We shall.

12:30.695 --> 12:34.698
As long as you don't attempt
to tell any more jokes.

12:34.732 --> 12:37.233
(George): My mother-in-law hates me so much

12:37.268 --> 12:39.570
she said she'd dance on my grave.

12:39.604 --> 12:42.840
I said good, I plan to be buried at sea.

12:42.874 --> 12:44.775
(chuckling): That's awful, George.

12:44.809 --> 12:46.877
You do know in that scenario she'd wind up

12:46.911 --> 12:49.079
beside you for an eternity.

12:49.113 --> 12:51.448
Well yes, I suppose you're
right. Good thinking, Edna.

12:51.483 --> 12:55.085
I guess Bert Grady didn't think
of that when he conceived the joke.

12:55.119 --> 12:57.220
You should let me take
you to a show sometime.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.222
Oh, I don't know, George.

12:59.256 --> 13:02.125
Well there's all kinds of acts
there. Something for everybody.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.694
Do you want me to just call a plumber?

13:04.728 --> 13:08.398
No, heavens! Never pay for what
you could do yourself for free.

13:08.432 --> 13:10.466
There we go.

13:10.501 --> 13:12.802
That's all it was a clogged Ptrap.

13:12.836 --> 13:16.405
I'm most thankful, George.

13:16.439 --> 13:20.309
It was my pleasure.

13:31.954 --> 13:34.490
(cracking knuckles)

13:36.826 --> 13:39.661
(audience laughing)

13:44.199 --> 13:47.135
(laughter swelling)

13:50.039 --> 13:52.541
(playing dissonant chord)

14:06.455 --> 14:08.956
(grunting) (audience murmuring)

14:08.990 --> 14:11.025
(audience applauding)

14:23.838 --> 14:25.607
(audience applauding)

14:26.341 --> 14:29.309
(Ward): So the lady says to me, "You
should stop and smell the roses."

14:29.343 --> 14:33.180
So I says to her... "Oh! You're all wet!"

14:33.214 --> 14:35.748
(laughing)

14:37.085 --> 14:39.319
Hey there folks, settle down.

14:39.353 --> 14:41.588
I got a real treat for ya.

14:41.622 --> 14:44.291
Ever seen one of these?
This is my 11-foot pole.

14:44.325 --> 14:47.727
... For everything I wouldn't
touch with my 10-foot pole!

14:47.761 --> 14:51.831
(laughing loudly)

14:51.865 --> 14:55.134
Well, it's funny when he says it.

14:55.168 --> 14:57.169
Thank you, I've been Ed Ward!

14:57.204 --> 15:00.339
(manager): Alright, ladies and gentlemen,

15:00.373 --> 15:02.408
it's up to you!

15:02.442 --> 15:06.878
Now, who should win
the audience prize, hmm?

15:06.913 --> 15:11.183
Should it be... W.C. Fields,

15:11.218 --> 15:15.488
- the eccentric juggler?
- (Applauding)

15:15.522 --> 15:21.727
Or should it be Toronto's strongest man?

15:21.761 --> 15:25.931
(Mr. Allen giggling)

15:25.965 --> 15:30.702
Or should it be Mr. Ed Ward?

15:30.737 --> 15:34.106
- (applauding loudly)
- There you are,

15:34.140 --> 15:36.341
ladies and gentlemen.
The audience prize goes to

15:36.375 --> 15:41.179
the one, the only Mr. Ed Ward!

15:41.213 --> 15:43.781
There ya go, boy.

15:43.815 --> 15:46.083
It seems Mr. Ward is profiting

15:46.118 --> 15:48.353
from his former partner's demise.

15:48.387 --> 15:52.357
Indeed. Jealousy, bad blood,
and now financial gain.

15:52.391 --> 15:57.194
- Motive for murder?
- Mr. Ward is becoming less amusing all the time.

16:05.366 --> 16:07.768
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Ward.</i>

16:07.802 --> 16:09.770
Did you enjoy the show, Detective?

16:09.804 --> 16:12.672
- My wife certainly did.
- Mm-hmm.

16:12.706 --> 16:16.309
Mr. Ward, you neglected to mention that
you and Mr. Grady used to be partners.

16:16.343 --> 16:20.547
- I fail to see the relevance.
- You now have a substantial amount of money in your pocket

16:20.581 --> 16:22.582
that would have otherwise
gone to Mr. Grady,

16:22.616 --> 16:25.685
were he were still with us.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.954
You think I'm wrapped up in this?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.856
Now is your opportunity
to convince me otherwise.

16:30.891 --> 16:33.459
Oh, no. I...

16:33.493 --> 16:36.028
- I feel faint... Oh, my!
- (whoopee cushion farting)

16:36.063 --> 16:40.199
Mr. Ward, where were you
last night at 11 o'clock?

16:40.233 --> 16:42.301
Last night? I, uh... I... I can't...

16:42.335 --> 16:44.303
Please, collect yourself

16:44.337 --> 16:46.738
and recall your whereabouts
last night, Mr. Ward.

16:46.772 --> 16:50.242
Uh... the dump! I was at the dump.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.411
- The refuse dump?
- Yes!

16:52.445 --> 16:55.147
Yes. That's where I get all my props.

16:55.181 --> 16:59.284
- At 11 o'clock at night?
- Please sir, you have to believe me.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.352
That's when the fresh load comes in.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.564
Sir, I've just been to...

17:13.598 --> 17:15.634
Are you making rubber bands again?

17:15.667 --> 17:17.800
What have you, George?

17:17.836 --> 17:19.803
Sir, I've just been to the refuse dump.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.839
While nobody can confirm that Mr. Ward

17:21.873 --> 17:23.840
was there at the exact time in question,

17:23.875 --> 17:25.843
I have been told that he
frequents the place late at night.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.345
That's the best time, apparently,

17:27.378 --> 17:29.713
- when all the fresh loads arrive.
- Ah, yes.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.082
Mr. Ward mentioned that.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.484
George, if he is innocent, we
have to consider the possibility

17:34.519 --> 17:38.122
that Mr. Grady's murder may have
nothing to do with his colleagues.

17:38.156 --> 17:40.190
Sir, what I keep wondering is,

17:40.224 --> 17:44.061
what's Mr. Grady, a man of means, even
doing in that part of town to begin with?

17:44.095 --> 17:46.396
That's an excellent question.

18:00.444 --> 18:02.912
- Mrs. Moore...
- Miss.

18:02.946 --> 18:05.148
... Miss Moore,

18:05.183 --> 18:07.316
you overheard Mr. Grady saying,

18:07.350 --> 18:10.319
"what the hell are you doing
here," just prior to the gunshots?

18:10.353 --> 18:12.722
Yes. As if he was surprised to see the man.

18:12.756 --> 18:15.658
Likely even more surprised
when he was shot by him.

18:15.693 --> 18:18.861
How can you be sure it
was Mr. Grady's voice?

18:18.896 --> 18:22.131
Oh, I knew his voice. He
was always here. Kept a room.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.166
For what purpose?

18:24.201 --> 18:26.235
I believe he wrote his jokes here.

18:26.269 --> 18:28.870
Always a notebook in hand.

18:28.905 --> 18:30.839
But that's not all he used it for.

18:30.873 --> 18:35.411
- He had female company.
- Always the same woman.

18:35.445 --> 18:38.414
- Could you describe her for us?
- Slender woman.

18:38.448 --> 18:41.016
Handsome except for the
scar on the side of her face.

18:46.723 --> 18:49.557
(key turning in lock)

18:53.229 --> 18:56.431
Oh, my! I should have
required a larger deposit.

18:58.634 --> 19:00.702
(George): Miss Moore,
did you notice anybody

19:00.736 --> 19:03.738
- suspicious in the hotel the night of the murder?
- In this hotel?

19:03.772 --> 19:06.541
We don't exactly cater to Toronto's finest.

19:06.575 --> 19:08.843
I believe what Constable
Crabtree is asking is,

19:08.877 --> 19:10.945
could someone have slipped
past you and gained entry

19:10.979 --> 19:12.179
into Mr. Grady's room?

19:12.214 --> 19:14.215
I wouldn't know. I left the front desk

19:14.249 --> 19:16.450
to see what happened outside.

19:18.787 --> 19:21.222
Well, clearly someone
was looking for something.

19:21.256 --> 19:24.458
This desk has been emptied out. Do
you know what Mr. Grady kept in here?

19:24.492 --> 19:27.061
I wouldn't know.

19:27.095 --> 19:30.564
Sir, do you think Mr. Grady
was murdered for his jokes?

19:30.598 --> 19:32.832
- That's possible.
- Well, if that's the case, sir,

19:32.867 --> 19:34.868
it stands to reason that
somebody at the theatre

19:34.902 --> 19:37.704
might be responsible. And
that makes me wonder, sir,

19:37.739 --> 19:40.307
if we should have a couple of constables

19:40.341 --> 19:42.342
stationed there at the theatre,

19:42.377 --> 19:44.544
undercover, posing as performers,

19:44.579 --> 19:48.481
- to keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
- Who did you have in mind, exactly?

19:48.515 --> 19:50.683
Well, I hadn't given it a
great deal of thought, sir.

19:50.717 --> 19:53.653
- But I suppose...
- Jackson and Worsley could do.

19:53.687 --> 19:56.589
- Excellent idea.
- Uh... Sir, nothing

19:56.623 --> 19:59.225
- against Worsley, but...
- Would you like to do it,

19:59.260 --> 20:02.695
- George? Perhaps you and Henry?
- That's an excellent idea.

20:02.729 --> 20:04.863
In fact, Henry and I have been
working out a little routine.

20:04.898 --> 20:09.234
Mm. Just clear it with Mr. Allen first,

20:09.269 --> 20:12.371
- and don't forget why you're there in the first place.
- Sir, absolutely.

20:20.446 --> 20:23.581
(in Murdoch's voice): Inspector, there's
been a robbery at the Toronto Bank.

20:23.616 --> 20:27.286
- (in Brackenreid's voice): Oh, bloody Hell!
- I know, sir.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.087
It's quite unfortunate.
Wha... wha... what is?

20:29.122 --> 20:31.623
- The robbery.
- What robbery?

20:31.657 --> 20:34.927
The Toronto Bank! I just told you it's
been robbed. Isn't that why you cursed?

20:34.961 --> 20:37.094
No, Murdoch, I cursed

20:37.129 --> 20:39.464
'cause I'm out of bloody Scotch!

20:39.498 --> 20:42.701
- Pass.
- We've only just started.

20:42.735 --> 20:44.803
- Pass!
- Mr. Allen, if somebody in your

20:44.837 --> 20:46.805
employ is indeed responsible
for Mr. Grady's death,

20:46.839 --> 20:50.575
is it not in your best interest to have
us around in case something happens?

20:50.609 --> 20:52.609
Fine, you can be ushers.

20:52.644 --> 20:54.278
Sir, I will point out that we

20:54.313 --> 20:56.647
do not have a two-act
in our lineup presently.

20:56.681 --> 20:58.716
You know what else we don't have?

20:58.750 --> 21:01.185
A cat orchestra. Now that's
what people really want to see.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.321
Sir, I will remind you that those are very

21:03.355 --> 21:06.557
- difficult to book. It's a dying art form, it seems.
- Damn it, Hoffat,

21:06.591 --> 21:08.559
I don't pay you to tell
me what we can't do,

21:08.593 --> 21:11.228
- I pay you to get things done.
- Yes, of course, you're right,

21:11.262 --> 21:14.331
sir, but nonetheless, I believe that if we
brought on a two-act it might be beneficial.

21:14.366 --> 21:18.935
- You really want to put these two coppers on the stage?
- Even if they flop,

21:18.970 --> 21:21.472
it'll be good for business.
Remember the Cherry Sisters?

21:21.506 --> 21:24.508
That was my mother-in-law's brilliant idea.

21:24.542 --> 21:27.010
Women just aren't funny.

21:27.044 --> 21:29.412
I'll never put one on the stage again.

21:29.446 --> 21:32.883
Yeah, but they were so bad that people
came to see just how bad they were.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.951
- Audiences relish it.
- Fine. But I don't want

21:34.986 --> 21:39.489
any of my boys knowing that they're
real coppers. And I'm not paying you!

21:39.523 --> 21:45.027
- What if we win the audience prize?
- Henry! Mr. Allen, you won't regret this. I already do.

21:45.061 --> 21:47.730
Now go find a place to
rehearse you're on tonight!

21:56.239 --> 21:58.374
(George): Let's do it again,
Henry. Now be a little bit

21:58.408 --> 22:00.442
more Murdoch-like if you could, this time.

22:00.476 --> 22:02.611
- (Henry): Yes, sir.
- I told you,

22:02.645 --> 22:04.979
- I'm out of bloody Scotch!
- I would like to interview

22:05.014 --> 22:09.451
- the witnesses, sir.
- Are you sure that's top priority, Murdoch?

22:09.485 --> 22:11.820
Perhaps you are right. I shall
start by checking the bank

22:11.854 --> 22:14.823
- for fingermarks.
- No, not fingermarks.

22:14.857 --> 22:16.892
I'm out of bloody Scotch!

22:16.926 --> 22:19.693
You would like for me to buy
you some more Scotch first?

22:19.728 --> 22:23.231
George, it's your line.

22:23.265 --> 22:26.700
Higgins...

22:31.173 --> 22:33.874
I think we've just found
the key to our case,

22:33.909 --> 22:36.343
- me old mucker.
- Indeed, sir.

22:40.935 --> 22:43.202
<i>Eleanor Hoffat, wife of Lewis Hoffat,</i>

22:43.296 --> 22:45.597
the theatre's assistant manager. Sir,

22:45.665 --> 22:48.300
she matches the description of
Mr. Grady's mistress exactly.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.572
<i>- (Dr. Grace): A robbery.
- It's a rather violent one,</i>

22:53.606 --> 22:55.674
Were there any witnesses?

22:59.579 --> 23:02.313
Why were you at the scene
of Mr. Grady's murder?

23:02.347 --> 23:05.216
- I wasn't.
- I saw you there.

23:05.250 --> 23:08.186
He was already dead by the time I arrived.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.221
Where were you at 11 PM, then?

23:10.255 --> 23:13.724
- In a hansom.
- On the way to the hotel

23:13.758 --> 23:20.232
to meet Mr. Grady. You were
carrying on relations with him.

23:21.266 --> 23:24.235
I can bring in the hotel manager

23:24.269 --> 23:26.904
to confirm that you were
indeed Mr. Grady's mistress.

23:27.008 --> 23:29.009
Yes, I was.

23:29.044 --> 23:32.379
How long had the affair been going on?

23:32.413 --> 23:34.748
Two months.

23:36.718 --> 23:39.086
Right, then. You're familiar with the room

23:39.120 --> 23:42.822
- that Mr. Grady kept?
- Yes.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.825
What was in his desk?

23:45.859 --> 23:48.395
- Notebooks.
- Notebooks.

23:48.429 --> 23:52.299
- For his monologues?
- Yes.

23:52.333 --> 23:55.435
Do you know of anyone who may have
wanted to obtain those notebooks?

23:55.469 --> 23:58.304
No. Detective, I assure you,

23:58.338 --> 24:01.473
I know nothing about poor Bert's murder.

24:01.508 --> 24:04.310
In fact I'd barely seen him this past week.

24:04.344 --> 24:07.146
Why was that?

24:07.181 --> 24:11.117
Because I didn't want to
carry on with him anymore.

24:11.151 --> 24:14.353
I was going there to end our relationship.

24:14.387 --> 24:16.722
Why that night?

24:16.756 --> 24:20.025
I couldn't keep the secret any longer.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.295
Lewis was devastated.

24:26.734 --> 24:30.536
Hurting my husband that way is
the worst thing I've ever done,

24:30.570 --> 24:33.438
and I'll never forgive myself.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.941
When did your husband learn of the affair?

24:38.211 --> 24:40.946
A week ago.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.289
Well, thank you for
bringing me lunch, Edna.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.591
Well, thank you for fixing my sink.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.127
- Oh, is it leaking again?
- No.

24:56.161 --> 24:59.230
You half sound as though
you expected it to.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.932
Well, I may have exaggerated
my plumbing prowess.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.805
That's a lovely sandwich, Edna.

25:07.839 --> 25:11.308
It's nothing remarkable,
it's just ham and cheese.

25:11.342 --> 25:15.345
And butter.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.082
Oh, I have something for you.

25:20.618 --> 25:23.754
(laughing): A vaudeville ticket?

25:23.788 --> 25:26.390
I have to work, but I hear
there's a new comedic sensation

25:26.424 --> 25:28.525
- making his debut this evening.
- Well, how can

25:28.559 --> 25:33.430
- I resist? Thank you, George.
- And thank you for the sandwich.

25:33.464 --> 25:37.333
I won't use butter next time.
You're even fussier than Simon is!

25:37.367 --> 25:39.335
Butter has its place in many things, Edna,

25:39.369 --> 25:41.370
but a friend of the sandwich it is not.

25:41.405 --> 25:43.506
(chuckling)

25:43.540 --> 25:46.943
Mr. Grady was a man of
considerable talent and charm.

25:46.977 --> 25:50.546
And Eleanor is quite, um, impressionable.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.782
- Where were you that night?
- At work.

25:52.817 --> 25:54.883
After the show. 11 PM.

25:54.918 --> 25:57.520
I work after the show. First in, last out.

25:57.554 --> 26:00.856
Can anyone corroborate this, Mr. Hoffat?

26:00.890 --> 26:03.659
- Your constables.
- My constables?

26:03.694 --> 26:05.695
Certainly they told you.

26:05.729 --> 26:08.831
I was giving Mr. Crabtree and Mr. Higgins
a tour of the theatre until midnight.

26:08.865 --> 26:11.967
(Brackenreid): Hoffat's alibi
was Crabtree and Higgins?

26:12.001 --> 26:14.703
- Now, there's a first.
- Something George neglected

26:14.737 --> 26:16.905
- to mention.
- I'm sorry, sirs.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.341
I am perhaps slightly distracted
with tonight's performance.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.343
At any rate, the killer was clearly

26:21.377 --> 26:24.046
after the contents of Mr. Grady's desk,

26:24.080 --> 26:26.715
his monologues which would imply

26:26.749 --> 26:28.817
someone with ties to the theatre.

26:28.851 --> 26:31.419
Sounds like we better get
back to the Bradley tonight.

26:31.454 --> 26:33.988
Oh, and we fully expect you
to report all of your findings

26:34.022 --> 26:36.524
after this evening's performance, George.

26:36.559 --> 26:38.693
If you're not too distracted, bugalugs.

26:38.728 --> 26:41.262
Sirs...

26:52.574 --> 26:56.610
(cheering and applauding)

27:01.716 --> 27:03.884
Oh, God. Edna's here!

27:03.918 --> 27:06.253
(Henry): Well, you did
give her a ticket, George.

27:06.287 --> 27:08.455
You're sure you know all your lines, Henry?

27:08.490 --> 27:11.958
Don't worry. I'll be great. I might
even crack the case while I'm at it.

27:11.993 --> 27:14.361
- Tough crowd tonight, boys.
- Let's give a large round

27:14.396 --> 27:16.863
of applause to the little but mighty

27:16.898 --> 27:20.400
- Toronto's strongest man!
- (Audience cheering)

27:20.434 --> 27:23.669
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

27:23.704 --> 27:25.571
making their Bradley Theatre debut,

27:25.606 --> 27:27.640
here they are,

27:27.674 --> 27:30.743
The Madcap Coppers! Take it away, boys!

27:34.915 --> 27:37.116
(applauding hesitantly)

27:40.186 --> 27:42.555
Sir, I believe George is meant to be you.

27:42.589 --> 27:45.291
Then Higgins is surely
meant to be you, Murdoch.

27:45.325 --> 27:47.393
(woman): What are they gonna do now?

27:47.428 --> 27:50.095
Inspector, there's been a
robbery at the Toronto Bank.

27:53.166 --> 27:55.935
(booing)

27:55.969 --> 27:58.804
I say, Inspector,

27:58.838 --> 28:01.506
there's been a robbery at the Toronto Bank.

28:01.541 --> 28:03.575
(booing and jeering)

28:03.609 --> 28:06.578
- George, it's your line.
- I, wha... What?

28:06.612 --> 28:08.713
Just say, "Bloody Hell!"

28:13.052 --> 28:15.487
- Just say, "Bloody hell!"
- It's gotta get started

28:15.521 --> 28:19.157
sometime, folks, and some people
shouldn't get started at all.

28:19.191 --> 28:21.693
Get off the stage.

28:21.727 --> 28:25.430
Well, since there's
nowhere else to go but up...

28:25.464 --> 28:28.399
What happened, George?

28:28.434 --> 28:30.468
Henry, I think you stepped
on my line. It threw me.

28:30.502 --> 28:33.637
- I did no such thing!
- I don't know what happened,

28:33.672 --> 28:35.639
- Henry, I'm sorry.
- You caught a glimpse of your

28:35.674 --> 28:37.641
sweetheart in the
audience and you froze up.

28:37.676 --> 28:40.644
If she even is my
sweetheart after this. Ugh...

28:40.679 --> 28:44.147
And if you have a deep grudge
against yourself, marry a widow.

28:44.182 --> 28:46.483
You married a widow.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.985
- I did. Ugh!
- (Audience laughing)

28:49.019 --> 28:52.388
I told her I would be her
captain in life, she said it was

28:52.422 --> 28:56.292
too late to be her captain, now
I'm stuck as her second mate.

28:56.326 --> 29:00.196
She's as fully large east and
west as she is north and south.

29:00.230 --> 29:02.898
She was meant for twins
but was never divided.

29:02.932 --> 29:06.369
I didn't kiss the bride for fear
the guests would lose their appetite.

29:06.403 --> 29:09.238
(audience laughing and applauding)

29:11.241 --> 29:13.575
Sirs, Mr. Fields' monologue
bore a striking resemblance

29:13.610 --> 29:16.712
- to Mr. Grady's routines.
- Fields was a juggler as of yesterday.

29:16.746 --> 29:18.747
And tonight he delivers a monologue

29:18.781 --> 29:20.849
- that brings down the house.
- There's no way he could have

29:20.884 --> 29:24.252
written something like that overnight.
It was a great bit of comedy.

29:24.286 --> 29:26.187
It's as if somebody wrote it for him, sir.

29:26.222 --> 29:29.892
- Perhaps he was the one that stole it from Grady's desk.
- He stole the bit!

29:29.926 --> 29:32.628
Hmm...

29:32.662 --> 29:35.130
The night that Hoffat showed
you around the theatre,

29:35.164 --> 29:37.165
do you recall if Mr. Fields was still here?

29:37.199 --> 29:39.767
- He had already left, sir.
- I'm sure he was feeling

29:39.801 --> 29:41.802
distraught because his
performance flopped...

29:41.837 --> 29:44.872
- a feeling I know from experience.
- Right.

29:44.907 --> 29:47.342
Have a look in Mr. Fields'
dressing room, see if there

29:47.376 --> 29:49.444
may be anything there
that could have been stolen

29:49.478 --> 29:52.547
- from Mr. Grady's hotel room.
- Sirs.

29:52.581 --> 29:54.615
I'll be with you in a moment, Higgins.

29:54.650 --> 29:58.753
I have a small matter
to attend to. Oh... Ah!

29:58.787 --> 30:01.055
That's better.

30:01.089 --> 30:03.691
I trust that it would have been
a flattering portrayal of us.

30:03.725 --> 30:07.428
Of course.

30:10.231 --> 30:14.201
- Edna!
- Well, well.

30:14.235 --> 30:16.437
George. I didn't know you were a comedian.

30:16.471 --> 30:19.406
- Not much of one, clearly.
- Well, I enjoyed the show.

30:19.441 --> 30:21.475
- Thank you for the tickets.
- Henry and I were thinking

30:21.509 --> 30:24.343
about the case, you see,
and that's a distraction.

30:24.378 --> 30:26.479
I think that came at the
cost of our performance.

30:26.513 --> 30:29.315
- Yes, of course.
- Come again tomorrow night.

30:29.349 --> 30:32.919
It will be less awful, I promise.

30:32.954 --> 30:35.922
I don't think I can, George,
I'm otherwise engaged,

30:35.957 --> 30:39.225
and I found the whole thing a
bit mean-spirited for my liking.

30:39.259 --> 30:43.396
- Good night, George.
- Good night.

30:43.430 --> 30:45.731
(Henry): George!

30:45.765 --> 30:47.967
Look what I found in Fields' dressing room.

30:48.001 --> 30:51.637
It's Bert Grady's monologues.

30:54.241 --> 30:58.043
Right.

31:00.379 --> 31:03.849
(Fields singing incoherently)

31:08.321 --> 31:10.723
(Murdoch): Mr. Fields, might I have a word?

31:10.757 --> 31:15.360
(very drunk): Would you
excuse us, my little chickadee?

31:18.297 --> 31:20.532
What are you breaking up
the party for, Detective?

31:20.566 --> 31:23.968
What were you planning to do once you ran
out of Bert Grady's material to perform?

31:24.003 --> 31:26.037
What are you talking about?

31:26.071 --> 31:28.973
This was Mr. Grady's notebook.
Some of the pages are missing.

31:29.008 --> 31:32.363
Presumably they contain some
yet-to-be-performed monologues.

31:32.364 --> 31:33.364
 So what?

31:33.479 --> 31:37.214
- It was found in your dressing room.
- What was it doing there?

31:37.249 --> 31:39.752
- That was going to be my next question.
- I've never seen it before.

31:39.986 --> 31:43.955
Mr. Fields, I saw your performance
tonight. It was remarkably like Mr. Grady's.

31:43.989 --> 31:48.659
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that you killed the man and stole his material.

31:48.693 --> 31:51.462
- I certainly did not.
- Where were you at 11 o'clock

31:51.496 --> 31:53.697
the night that Mr. Grady was murdered?

31:53.731 --> 31:56.500
I went straight to my hotel...  to drink.

31:56.535 --> 32:01.205
- I had a rotten show that night.
- Made worse by Mr. Grady humiliating you on stage.

32:01.239 --> 32:04.407
If you want the truth, here it is.

32:04.441 --> 32:08.478
I didn't write tonight's
material. I bought it.

32:08.512 --> 32:11.481
You bought it? From whom?

32:11.515 --> 32:13.717
I don't know. I received an
anonymous letter under my door

32:13.751 --> 32:15.819
offering to sell me jokes.

32:15.853 --> 32:19.722
I was desperate. The
juggling wasn't working out.

32:42.445 --> 32:45.514
- You all right, me old mucker?
- I wouldn't... I... I'm fine.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.983
So is Fields our man, Murdoch?

32:48.018 --> 32:50.119
I don't believe so, sir.

32:50.153 --> 32:52.554
The hotel confirmed that
he arrived shortly after

32:52.589 --> 32:55.023
the performance and promptly
ordered a bottle of whisky,

32:55.057 --> 32:57.593
and then a second one an hour later.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.761
Dedicated chap.

32:59.795 --> 33:02.063
What about Grady's notebook
being in his dressing room?

33:02.098 --> 33:03.732
He claims he's never seen it there before.

33:03.766 --> 33:05.734
So, planted by the killer perhaps.

33:05.768 --> 33:08.370
It's entirely possible, sir.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.772
- Sirs?
- What have you, George?

33:10.806 --> 33:14.542
The monologue that Bert Grady performed the
night he was killed is not in his notebook.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.946
I don't know if the torn
pages could account for that.

33:17.980 --> 33:22.283
What could be so valuable about bloody
jokes that you would kill for them?

33:22.317 --> 33:24.285
George, how much do you and Henry recall

33:24.319 --> 33:26.554
of Bert Grady's performance?

33:26.588 --> 33:30.658
(all laughing) She told me she
was gonna dance on my grave.

33:30.692 --> 33:32.760
I said "I hope you do, I
plan to be buried at sea."

33:32.794 --> 33:34.828
Why are we standing
around listening to jokes?

33:34.863 --> 33:36.797
This is a bloody murder investigation!

33:36.831 --> 33:38.832
- Bear with me a moment, sir.
- What do you do if you miss

33:38.867 --> 33:41.935
your mother-in-law? You
reload and try again.

33:41.970 --> 33:44.471
Now, now, now, I do have a
soft spot for my mother-in-law.

33:44.505 --> 33:47.975
It's right behind this theatre, in fact.

33:48.009 --> 33:50.043
I told my wife her mother was down-under.

33:50.078 --> 33:53.180
She thought I meant Australia.
At least she's six feet under.

33:53.214 --> 33:57.651
- A man in a tavern said to me that his...
- Stop. George, Henry,

33:57.685 --> 34:01.821
- get the shovels.
- Yes, sir.

34:08.795 --> 34:10.929
(Henry): What do you think, George?

34:10.964 --> 34:14.301
I think we've just found
somebody's mother-in-law.

34:22.837 --> 34:24.871
The deceased is indeed a
female of around 70 years.

34:24.905 --> 34:27.440
Based on the rate of decomposition,

34:27.474 --> 34:29.842
I would say she died
approximately 6 months ago.

34:29.877 --> 34:31.877
- And the cause of death?
- Three bullets to the chest.

34:31.911 --> 34:34.847
.22 calibre.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.416
Suggesting that this woman's
killer and Mr. Grady's

34:37.451 --> 34:41.152
- could be one and the same.
- (George): Sir!

34:41.187 --> 34:44.357
- Doctor Grace.
- Constable Crabtree.

34:44.391 --> 34:48.126
Sir, I think I know who our
victim is: a Mrs. Edith Bradley.

34:48.161 --> 34:51.196
- The theatre's namesake?
- That's right and rightful owner.

34:51.231 --> 34:54.733
She's said to have moved
6 months ago to Australia.

34:54.766 --> 34:58.003
"Down under", just as Mr. Grady
said in his comedy routine.

34:58.037 --> 35:00.739
(Dr. Grace): 6 months does
coincide with the time of death.

35:00.773 --> 35:03.508
And whose mother-in-law was
she unfortunate enough to be?

35:03.542 --> 35:05.877
In all my years in this business,

35:05.911 --> 35:07.945
this is the biggest joke I've ever heard.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.047
Why would I kill my star performer?

35:10.082 --> 35:12.517
Grady was a license to print money.

35:12.551 --> 35:14.519
Mr. Grady knew you
killed your mother-in-law.

35:14.553 --> 35:17.722
His monologue reflected
the details of the murder

35:17.757 --> 35:19.758
I believe he was planning to blackmail you.

35:19.792 --> 35:23.560
Now you're saying I killed Bert
Grady and my own mother-in-law?

35:23.595 --> 35:25.562
With Mrs. Bradley out
of the way, you'd be able

35:25.597 --> 35:27.564
to run the theatre as you see fit,

35:27.599 --> 35:30.834
and all of the proceeds would go to you.

35:30.869 --> 35:33.437
Well you're mistaken, Detective.

35:33.471 --> 35:37.741
Mrs. Bradley moved to
Australia 6 months ago.

35:37.776 --> 35:40.076
You waited outside of the hotel.

35:40.111 --> 35:42.879
When Mr. Grady arrived you shot him.

35:42.913 --> 35:45.915
You took his notebook and removed
the incriminating monologue.

35:45.949 --> 35:48.583
You then planted that
notebook in Mr. Fields' room.

35:48.618 --> 35:50.352
That's funny, Detective.

35:50.387 --> 35:52.755
Have you ever thought
about going into comedy?

35:52.790 --> 35:57.192
Well, if you liked that,
you're going to love this one.

36:01.331 --> 36:04.599
Constable Crabtree found
this in your office.

36:04.634 --> 36:08.137
The ballistics evidence is
a match for both murders.

36:08.171 --> 36:11.307
You know what I still don't understand is,

36:11.341 --> 36:17.612
how the hell did Grady know I killed her?

36:20.282 --> 36:22.417
Two murders solved in one
day. Good work, Murdoch.

36:22.452 --> 36:24.419
Thank you, sir.

36:24.454 --> 36:27.923
But Keith Allen did pose
an interesting question.

36:27.957 --> 36:30.258
- Question about what?
- How did Mr. Grady

36:30.292 --> 36:32.560
know that Mr. Allen
murdered his mother-in-law?

36:32.794 --> 36:35.163
What's it matter? You got
a confession, didn't you?

36:35.262 --> 36:37.363
And regardless of all of that,

36:37.398 --> 36:39.899
why blackmail someone
through a comedy routine?

36:39.933 --> 36:42.635
And why was Mr. Grady surprised to see

36:42.669 --> 36:45.171
Mr. Allen outside of his hotel that night?

36:45.205 --> 36:48.874
There are more questions than
answers. Let it go, Murdoch.

36:51.611 --> 36:54.547
I suppose you're right.

36:54.581 --> 36:57.049
Are you coming to Crabtree and
Higgins' final show tonight?

36:57.083 --> 36:59.184
- Oh yes, Julia insists.
- Well,

36:59.218 --> 37:01.921
here's hoping for a repeat
performance from our lads.

37:01.955 --> 37:04.289
I intend to get in on the action this time.

37:13.566 --> 37:17.436
W.C. Fields, ladies and gentlemen.

37:17.470 --> 37:20.405
Now, our next performer
will be making her debut

37:20.440 --> 37:24.275
here at The Bradley Theatre,
please welcome Desperate Dora,

37:24.309 --> 37:30.114
here to regale you with
stories of her busted romances!

37:30.148 --> 37:32.383
(applauding hesitantly)

37:32.417 --> 37:35.186
Sir, that's Eleanor Hoffat.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.521
I didn't know she was a comedian.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.791
Pays to be married to the new manager.

37:47.466 --> 37:51.168
- (woman *1): Come on, love!
- (woman * 2): Come on, dear!

37:51.203 --> 37:54.071
They tell me some foreign
countries find it difficult

37:54.106 --> 37:58.709
to recruit men for their armies,
but they've got nothing on me.

37:58.743 --> 38:03.947
I've been trying for years to
recruit just one man and can't do it.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.917
(audience laughing)

38:06.951 --> 38:10.186
Another monologist from nowhere,

38:10.221 --> 38:12.222
just like W.C. Fields.

38:12.256 --> 38:14.257
Perhaps she bought her routine as well?

38:14.291 --> 38:17.327
I'm going to have a word with her.

38:17.361 --> 38:19.962
I'm strong for conscription,

38:19.997 --> 38:22.165
but then what can I expect?

38:22.199 --> 38:25.801
Look at me, I'm so thin I
have to drink muddy water

38:25.836 --> 38:29.839
so you can't see through
me. I'm hardly a catch.

38:31.942 --> 38:35.044
Last summer I thought I had one landed,

38:35.078 --> 38:38.180
a travelling salesman.

38:38.214 --> 38:40.315
He suggested we go bathing.

38:40.350 --> 38:43.085
But the moment he got a
flash, he kept on travelling.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.688
A clinging wet bathing suit is alright

38:46.722 --> 38:49.824
if it has something to cling to.

38:49.859 --> 38:51.760
Mr. Hoffat. I need to speak
to your wife immediately.

38:51.794 --> 38:55.130
- Yeah, but she's in the middle of a routine!
- Yes. And who wrote

38:55.165 --> 38:57.666
- this monologue?
- Well, she did, of course.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.668
Then I have to arrest her
for writing the monologue that

38:59.702 --> 39:02.003
incited Mr. Allen to kill Mr. Grady.

39:02.137 --> 39:07.108
Wait! It wasn't her. I
wrote it, just as I had

39:07.143 --> 39:09.510
written for Mr. Grady
in exchange for money.

39:09.545 --> 39:12.580
As well as the one Mr.
Fields performed recently.

39:12.614 --> 39:15.216
- (audience laughing)
- Eleanor acted as my courier,

39:15.250 --> 39:17.618
delivering the monologues
to Mr. Grady in his hotel.

39:17.653 --> 39:21.656
That's how the affair began.

39:21.690 --> 39:24.358
It wasn't enough that
I was making him a star,

39:24.393 --> 39:26.927
he wanted my wife, too.

39:26.961 --> 39:30.498
I should never have put
her in that position.

39:30.532 --> 39:33.634
You provoked Mr. Allen to
do your murdering for you.

39:33.669 --> 39:35.836
How did you know his secret?

39:35.870 --> 39:39.506
I arrived early to the theatre one
morning and saw him digging a pit.

39:39.630 --> 39:42.132
When Mrs. Bradley left for Australia,

39:42.167 --> 39:44.902
I knew he had killed her.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.485
Mr. Hoffat, you realize
I must arrest you now.

39:48.519 --> 39:53.723
- On what charges?
- Inciting a crime is also a crime.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.892
The courts will have to
decide on your punishment.

39:55.926 --> 39:58.027
May I finish watching
Eleanor's performance?

39:58.061 --> 40:00.730
This has long been a dream of ours.

40:00.765 --> 40:03.733
(Eleanor): ... Perhaps it's just as
well that I cannot find a husband.

40:03.768 --> 40:06.669
After all, a man will spend three dollars

40:06.704 --> 40:09.805
a week on roses when he's courting a girl

40:09.839 --> 40:13.609
but once married he won't
even take home a nickel's worth

40:13.643 --> 40:17.079
- of dandelions. Thank you.
- (laughing and applauding)

40:19.416 --> 40:23.919
Keith Allen didn't think
that women could be funny.

40:28.257 --> 40:30.526
Thank you so much.

40:32.996 --> 40:36.011
You would like for me to buy you
some more Scotch first, Inspector?

40:36.037 --> 40:39.032
No, no, no, Murdoch! I'll pay for it.

40:39.067 --> 40:42.969
On the other hand, you'll have to cover me!

40:43.003 --> 40:46.272
I'm afraid you still owe me
from the last bottle, sir.

40:46.306 --> 40:49.509
I think someone's been helping
themselves to my bloody Scotch.

40:49.543 --> 40:52.078
- I doubt that, sir.
- Well then, we best check

40:52.112 --> 40:54.681
for fingermarks, Murdoch.
Very well, Inspector.

40:54.715 --> 40:57.383
- I'll be at the bank.
- Not the bank, Murdoch!

40:57.417 --> 41:01.420
The bottles! Check the
bottles for fingermarks!

41:01.454 --> 41:04.991
- Oh, bloody hell!
- (Laughing and applauding)

41:16.483 --> 41:20.486
Inspector! I thought they were quite good.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.388
Well, I didn't want to see it go to waste.

41:23.422 --> 41:25.891
- We did it, George!
- Well done, Henry.

41:25.925 --> 41:27.726
- We're going out on a high note.
- (Whistling)

41:27.760 --> 41:29.962
A woman's waiting for you out back.

41:29.996 --> 41:34.165
- Waiting for me?
- Yeah, you.

41:36.302 --> 41:39.670
A woman drove me to drink, you know.

41:39.705 --> 41:42.440
- I should write to thank her.
- (Chuckling)

41:42.475 --> 41:44.575
Mr. Fields. You should
be doing your own jokes,

41:44.610 --> 41:46.878
never mind this juggling business.

41:46.912 --> 41:49.113
Not sure about the voice though, huh?

41:56.588 --> 41:59.456
- I didn't know you were here.
- May I have your autograph?

41:59.491 --> 42:01.526
Well, who's the comedian?

42:01.560 --> 42:03.627
They let me watch from backstage.

42:03.661 --> 42:05.896
- How did you manage that?
- I said I was your sweetheart.

42:08.366 --> 42:10.367
I am, aren't I?

42:10.401 --> 42:12.469
I'd hoped so.

42:12.504 --> 42:14.471
Then you'll take me out?

42:14.506 --> 42:18.509
For the finest dinner a
constable's salary can afford.

42:18.543 --> 42:22.278
Well, Simon is at his
aunt's for the night, so...

42:22.312 --> 42:25.914
Perhaps you would come
over for tea afterwards?

42:25.949 --> 42:28.717
I'd like that. I'd like that very much.

42:28.752 --> 42:32.655
Good. The pipes need fixing again.

42:32.689 --> 42:34.857
- Oh...
- (Edna laughing)

42:34.891 --> 42:38.493
The joke's on you, George Crabtree.

42:47.136 --> 42:51.005
Oh, Julia. Come and
join me! The tea is here!

42:51.040 --> 42:54.008
Brilliant!

42:54.043 --> 42:56.944
William... How thoughtful!

42:56.979 --> 42:59.380
I promise never to stop courting you.

42:59.414 --> 43:03.284
Please...

43:05.320 --> 43:08.089
- (whoopee cushion farting)
- (snorting)

43:11.794 --> 43:14.729
It worked so well!

43:14.763 --> 43:16.930
(both laughing)
