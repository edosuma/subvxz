IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

MY BIG SISTER LEFT.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.420
- AND THE PHONE
YOU'RE CALLING ME FROM,

00:52.453 --> 00:54.822
DOES IT HAVE A CORD
THAT GOES INTO THE WALL?

00:54.855 --> 00:59.827

I PLAY ANGRY BIRDS.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.562
- OKAY, SAM, I'M GONNA
SEND SOMEONE TO YOUR HOUSE.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.233

WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU, OKAY?

01:09.870 --> 01:12.873

01:12.906 --> 01:14.442
CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING
ABOUT WHERE YOU LIVE?

01:14.475 --> 01:15.609
IS THERE AN ELEVATOR?

01:15.643 --> 01:17.845

01:17.878 --> 01:19.347
- OKAY, SAM, THAT'S GOOD.

01:19.380 --> 01:22.316
JUST SIT TIGHT.
DON'T HANG UP, OKAY?

02:02.223 --> 02:03.624
SO CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:03.657 --> 02:05.326
- I WAS SLEEPING.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.262
MY MOM AND MY SISTER
WERE FIGHTING

02:08.296 --> 02:12.600
ABOUT A--A BAD MAN
TAKING MY SISTER AWAY.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.470
- OKAY.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.240
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

[Law & Order theme]

02:23.544 --> 02:31.552
*

03:10.724 --> 03:13.661
- HI, LIV.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.696
I REACHED THE FATHER.
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.730
- HOW'S THE MOTHER?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.232
- THEY'RE DOING AN MRI.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.967
SHE HAS A GASH
ON THE BACK OF HER HEAD.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.335
THE NEIGHBORS HEARD
SOME RAISED VOICES.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.437
NOTHING DRAMATIC.
WHAT DID THE KID SEE?

03:23.471 --> 03:25.606
- WELL, IT'S HARD TO TELL.
HE'S BARELY FOUR.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.276
HE SAID THAT HE HEARD
HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER

03:28.309 --> 03:30.411
FIGHTING ABOUT A BAD MAN.

03:30.444 --> 03:34.448
- HI, UH, I'M GEOFF AVERY,
UM, GRACE'S HUSBAND.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.383
WHERE'S MY WIFE?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.318
- MR. AVERY,
THEY'RE DOING A BRAIN SCAN.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.752
SHE SUSTAINED A HEAD INJURY.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.289
- OH, MY GOD.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.690
[kiss]

03:42.723 --> 03:45.526
SAM'S OKAY.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.328
WHERE'S CATE,
MY DAUGHTER?

03:47.361 --> 03:48.329
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AT HOME.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.297
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.499
- WE'RE TRYING TO
PIECE THAT TOGETHER NOW.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.435
NOW, HOW OLD IS YOUR DAUGHTER?
- 16.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.437
- CAN YOU GET IN TOUCH WITH HER?
- NO.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.472
SHE WAS TEXTING
AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE,

03:58.506 --> 03:59.673
SO I TOOK HER CELL PHONE
AWAY.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.710
- SO, GEOFF,
WHERE WERE YOU TONIGHT?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.346
- WITH MY SISTERS, CLEARING OUT
MY MOM'S APARTMENT.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.648
SHE PASSED AWAY LAST WEEK
FROM BREAST CANCER.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.483
LOOK, IF MY DAUGHTER'S
BEEN ABDUCTED,

04:09.517 --> 04:10.818
YOU NEED TO
PUT OUT AN AMBER ALERT.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.420
- WE CAN'T ISSUE
AN AMBER ALERT.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.522
NOBODY ACTUALLY SAW HER
BEING TAKEN.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.691
- MY WIFE'S UNCONSCIOUS,
MY DAUGHTER'S MISSING.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.026
- SHE MAY HAVE FALLEN.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.461
THERE WERE SIGNS THAT
SHE'D BEEN DRINKING.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.596
- DAMN IT.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.632
SHE SWORE TO ME
THAT WAS UNDER CONTROL.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.066
- RIGHT.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.668
SO DOES CATE
STAY OUT LATE?

04:27.701 --> 04:28.669
DOES SHE HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

04:28.702 --> 04:29.837
- I DON'T THINK SO.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.505
- BUT YOU DON'T KNOW?

04:31.539 --> 04:34.074
- SHE BLOCKED ME FROM
HER FACEBOOK PAGE LAST MONTH,

04:34.107 --> 04:35.309
ON HER BIRTHDAY.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.577
CHANGED HER PASSWORD.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.645
- WHAT ABOUT GIRLFRIENDS?

04:37.678 --> 04:40.047
COULD SHE BE OUT
WITH ANY OF THEM?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.383
- UH, ANGELA RIVA.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.419
THEY'VE BEEN BEST FRIENDS
SINCE KINDERGARTEN.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.459
- SO WHAT'S YOUR GUT?

04:51.492 --> 04:52.793
SHE'S OUT PARTYING,

04:52.826 --> 04:54.428
DOES THE WALK OF SHAME
IN THE MORNING?

04:54.462 --> 04:55.696
- WELL, NINE TIMES
OUT OF TEN,

04:55.729 --> 04:56.764
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
TAKE A CHANCE

04:56.797 --> 04:57.798
IF THIS IS A HOMICIDE.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.633
WE KEEP GOING.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.538
- CATE AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
FRIENDS SINCE FIFTH GRADE.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.440
- IS SHE IN SOME KIND
OF TROUBLE?

05:06.474 --> 05:07.641
- THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE YOU?

05:07.675 --> 05:08.709
- I WAS
HER SURROGATE MOTHER.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.710
SHE WAS HERE, EATING,
EVERY NIGHT.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.078
NEVER WANTED TO GO HOME.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.547
I TOLD ANGELA
TO STAY AWAY FROM HER.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.682
SHE HANGS WITH A BAD CROWD.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.450
- SHE'S BEEN
DIFFERENT LATELY, MOM.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.085
- DIFFERENT HOW?

05:18.118 --> 05:19.620
- LAST FEW WEEKS, I SAW HER
AT THE LIBRARY EVERY NIGHT,

05:19.653 --> 05:20.788
ON THE COMPUTER,

05:20.821 --> 05:23.424
REALLY TRYING TO
TURN HER GRADES AROUND.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.793
- YOU BUY THAT
STUDYING STORY?

05:25.826 --> 05:28.529
- MY GUESS IS, SHE DOESN'T
WANT HER PARENTS TO KNOW

05:28.562 --> 05:31.432
WHO SHE'S CHATTING WITH
ONLINE.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.533
- WHAT BOOKS
HAS SHE CHECKED OUT?

05:32.566 --> 05:33.567
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.536
- I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT THIS GIRL IS MISSING.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.837
- DO YOU HAVE A WARRANT?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.105
- I KNOW LIBRARIANS
CAN BE PRICKLY,

05:38.138 --> 05:39.306
BUT YOU'VE HEARD OF
THE PATRIOT ACT?

05:39.339 --> 05:42.376
- OH, NOW THIS MISSING GIRL
IS INVOLVED WITH TERRORISM?

05:42.410 --> 05:43.411
- IF WE HAVE TO,

05:43.444 --> 05:44.612
WE'LL GET THE FBI IN HERE
WITH A FISA WARRANT.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.813
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN
TURNED DOWN.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.448
- AND THAT'LL TAKE
HALF A DAY,

05:47.481 --> 05:48.849
AND THE CLOCK'S TICKING
ON THIS GIRL.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.485
- OKAY, FINE.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.853
I JUST WISH YOU GUYS
WOULD GIVE MORE THOUGHT

05:52.886 --> 05:54.154
TO CIVIL LIBERTIES.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.658
- WE DO. EVERY DAY.
NOW JUST, PLEASE, HUNT.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.693
[typing]

05:59.727 --> 06:01.595
- HERE'S YOUR "TERROR CELL."

06:01.629 --> 06:02.796
IN THE PAST MONTH,

06:02.830 --> 06:04.765
CATE HAS CHECKED OUT
THE HUNGER GAMES TRILOGY

06:04.798 --> 06:08.569
AND TWO BOOKS ON CHILDREN
BORN THROUGH SPERM DONATION.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.439
- "HEARTWARMING STORIES
FROM DONOR CHILDREN

06:11.472 --> 06:13.474
"WHO CONNECTED
WITH BIOLOGICAL PARENTS,

06:13.507 --> 06:14.508
BROTHERS, AND SISTERS."

06:14.542 --> 06:16.744
- WHICH COMPUTER
DID SHE USE?

06:16.777 --> 06:19.647
- CATE AVERY'S BEEN MISSING
FOR 15 HOURS.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.948
WAS SHE ABDUCTED?
DID SHE RUN AWAY?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.550
- UNTIL THE MOTHER CAN TALK,
WE CAN'T BE SURE.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.452
- THERE'S NO HITS
ON HER ATM,

06:24.485 --> 06:25.919
NO NEW CONTACTS
IN HER CELL PHONE.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.755
- YOU GUYS,
LOOK WHO WE FOUND

06:27.788 --> 06:28.889
WANDERING THROUGH
THE HALLWAY.

06:28.922 --> 06:29.923
- HEY.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.426
- JOHN, HEY.
GLAD TO GET YOUR CALL.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.927
- HEY.
- UHH!

06:33.961 --> 06:35.463
- THE DOCTOR WAS IN TOWN
AT A CONVENTION,

06:35.496 --> 06:36.329
DROPPED THE DIME.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.498
THOUGHT HE COULD HELP US
WITH THE CASE.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.667
YOU ALREADY KNOW AMANDA.
THIS IS DETECTIVE NICK AMARO.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.668
- HOW ARE YOU?

06:40.701 --> 06:41.835
- HOW'S THE NEW ASSIGNMENT?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.837
- A SINGLE, GAY
CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN,

06:43.871 --> 06:46.774
LIVING IN OKLAHOMA CITY,
OPPOSED TO THE DEATH PENALTY.

06:46.807 --> 06:47.875
IT'S HEAVEN.
- [laughs]

06:47.908 --> 06:49.176
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

06:49.209 --> 06:50.511
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW

06:50.544 --> 06:52.580
ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF DONOR CHILDREN?

06:52.613 --> 06:53.714
- THAT IS A BIG TOPIC.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.517
SPERM BANKS HAVE ALWAYS
PROTECTED DONOR CONFIDENTIALITY,

06:56.550 --> 06:57.785
BUT UNTIL RECENTLY,

06:57.818 --> 06:59.987
NOBODY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW
THAT AFFECTS OFFSPRING.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.655
- 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT
A MISSING TEENAGE GIRL

07:01.689 --> 07:02.590
RESEARCHING ALL OF THIS

07:02.623 --> 07:04.892
WHO JUST JOINED
MEETYOURDONORSIBLING.COM.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.494
- I'VE SEEN THOSE SITES.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.661
TURKEY-BASTER KIDS
LOOKING TO SEE

07:07.695 --> 07:08.862
IF THEY HAVE
HALF BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.799
- I THINK THE PREFERRED TERM
IS ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.567
- ISN'T THAT WHAT I SAID?

07:13.601 --> 07:14.602
- EITHER WAY,
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON

07:14.635 --> 07:16.537
FOR THESE CHILDREN TO TRY
AND FIND THEIR DONORS.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.672
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
THE RAISED VOICES WERE ABOUT.

07:18.706 --> 07:21.008
OUR GIRL MAY HAVE GOTTEN
INTO A FIGHT WITH HER MOTHER

07:21.041 --> 07:22.576
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.811
- A GIRL SEARCHING
FOR HER ROOTS.

07:23.844 --> 07:24.912
THAT COULD CAUSE
SOME TENSION.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.580
- WELL, THE MOTHER
CAN TELL US.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.949
GRACE AVERY'S BEEN RELEASED
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.788
- I SLIPPED, HIT MY HEAD,
WOKE UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.657
GEOFF SAYS CATE'S MISSING.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.692
- SAM SAID THAT YOU
AND CATE WERE FIGHTING

07:38.726 --> 07:39.993
ABOUT A "BAD MAN."

07:40.027 --> 07:41.228
- NO.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.630
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.698
- HE'S GOT AN IMAGINATION.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.833
I-I-I DON'T KNOW.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.669
- WHAT WERE YOU AND CATE
FIGHTING ABOUT?

07:48.702 --> 07:51.839
- JUST MOTHER-DAUGHTER STUFF.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.675
- WE KNOW THAT CATE
WAS SEARCHING ONLINE

07:54.708 --> 07:55.843
FOR DONOR RELATIVES,

07:55.876 --> 07:58.612
AND I'M GUESSING
THAT YOU DO TOO.

07:58.646 --> 08:03.517
- [sighs]

08:03.551 --> 08:09.657
MY HUSBAND CAN NEVER KNOW.
PLEASE.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.991
- OKAY.

08:11.024 --> 08:15.996
- CATE WAS CONCEIVED
WITH DONOR SPERM.

08:16.029 --> 08:19.733
SOMEHOW SHE TRACKED DOWN
THE DONOR ONLINE

08:19.767 --> 08:21.268
AND WAS ABOUT TO MEET HIM.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.937
I SAID NO.
WE FOUGHT.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.707
THAT'S WHAT SAM
MUST HAVE HEARD.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.678
- AND GEOFF BELIEVES HE'S
CATE'S BIOLOGICAL FATHER?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.580
- YEAH.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.281
- SO YOU WENT
TO A SPERM BANK.

08:34.314 --> 08:37.918
- I GOT PREGNANT WITH CATE.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.621
GEOFF AND I GOT MARRIED.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.289
AND THEN,
12 YEARS LATER,

08:42.322 --> 08:46.627
I USED THE SAME SAMPLE
TO HAVE SAM.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.562
- HOW DID CATE FIND OUT?

08:48.596 --> 08:53.734
- SHE WAS MAKING A MEMORY BOOK
FOR HER GRANDMOTHER.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.836
UH, GOING THROUGH
OLD PHOTO BOXES,

08:55.869 --> 09:01.642
SHE FOUND A MEDICAL CARD
FOR NEW YORK CRYOGENICS.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.844
"DONOR 141."

09:06.780 --> 09:09.316
- GEOFF NEVER KNEW
ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

09:09.349 --> 09:10.584
- FAMILY SECRETS.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.052
- LIV,
THIS IS BEYOND THAT.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.055
HIS WIFE LIED TO HIM ABOUT
THEIR TWO KIDS FOR 16 YEARS.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.790
SHE MANIPULATED HIM
INTO MARRYING HER.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.760
- HOLD ON, NICK. WE'VE GOT
A HIT ON CATE'S DEBIT CARD.

09:19.793 --> 09:23.597
COFFEE BAR AT LINCOLN CENTER.
$24.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.798
FIN AND ROLLINS ARE EN ROUTE.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.935
- 24 BUCKS.
THAT'S A LOT OF LATTE.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.970
- MAYBE CATE'S NOT ALONE.

09:30.971 --> 09:36.076
- * MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE

09:36.109 --> 09:40.614
[soft jazz music
continues in headphones]

09:45.385 --> 09:46.386
- HI.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.690
- CATE AVERY?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.891
- WHO ARE YOU GUYS?

09:50.924 --> 09:51.925
- WE'RE THE POLICE.

09:51.959 --> 09:56.029
YOUR MOTHER'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.065
- ARE YOU EXPECTING SOMEONE,
SWEETIE?

10:06.406 --> 10:07.875
- MY LITTLE BROTHER WATCHES
TOO MUCH CYBERCHASE.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.109
I WASN'T KIDNAPPED,
ALL RIGHT?

10:09.142 --> 10:12.045
- OH, WE KNOW, CATE,
BUT WE ALSO KNOW

10:12.079 --> 10:13.747
THAT YOU WERE SEARCHING
ON THE INTERNET

10:13.781 --> 10:15.115
FOR YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.117
IS THAT WHO YOU MET
LAST NIGHT?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.852
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10:18.886 --> 10:19.887
I WAS WITH A GIRLFRIEND.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.123
- HMM. WELL, WE'RE GONNA
NEED HER NAME, HONEY.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.092
- WHY AM I EVEN HERE?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.995
- FOR STARTERS, YOU DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT,

10:28.028 --> 10:31.999
AND YOU LEFT YOUR THREE-YEAR-OLD
BROTHER HOME ALONE

10:32.032 --> 10:33.767
AND YOUR MOTHER
UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR.

10:33.801 --> 10:34.968
- THAT WAS HER FAULT.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.104
SHE WAS DRINKING.
SHE FELL.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.907
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME,
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.074
- WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU?

10:41.108 --> 10:43.143
BECAUSE THEY NEVER TOLD YOU
WHO YOUR REAL FATHER WAS?

10:43.176 --> 10:46.213
- THEY LIED TO ME.
MY WHOLE LIFE.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.816
- AND YOU FOUND OUT
THE TRUTH ON YOUR OWN.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.718
YOU'RE A GOOD DETECTIVE.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.185
- BUT SO ARE WE.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.121
YOU'RE 16.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.455
YOU STAYED OUT ALL NIGHT

10:55.488 --> 10:57.691
WITH A MAN THAT YOU MET
ON THE INTERNET.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.060
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.096
- MR. AVERY'S HERE
TO TAKE CATE HOME.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.998
- THANK GOD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

11:05.032 --> 11:08.035
- HERE TO CLEAN UP
ANOTHER MESS, DAD?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.773
- MAKE YOU WISH
YOU HAD A DAUGHTER?

11:12.806 --> 11:15.108
- SHE CLAIMS SHE WAS HAVING
COFFEE WITH A GIRLFRIEND.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.177
- LOOK, THIS SON OF A BITCH
MIGHT BE A PRO.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.179
I MEAN, LOOK HOW HE SITS
WITH HIS BACK TO THE CAMERA.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.214
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.086
AS SOON AS HE SEES
THAT SHE CHARGED THE COFFEES,

11:26.119 --> 11:28.021
HE MAKES A QUICK EXIT.

11:28.055 --> 11:31.058
- AND THIS "DONOR 141" IS
CATE AVERY'S BIOLOGICAL FATHER?

11:31.091 --> 11:34.094
- WHO SHE LIED TO HER PARENTS
AND THE POLICE ABOUT MEETING.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.929
- YEAH, BUT COME ON,
SHE'S A TEENAGER.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.098
SHE JUST FINDS OUT THAT
HER DAD'S NOT HER REAL DAD.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.868
- YOU MEAN, BECAUSE HE ONLY
RAISED HER SINCE BIRTH?

11:40.901 --> 11:44.071
- I'M JUST SAYING, HER WORLD
HAS JUST BEEN ROCKED, RIGHT?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.206
I MEAN, SHE MANAGES TO MAKE
THIS CYBER CONNECTION

11:46.239 --> 11:47.941
WITH HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

11:47.975 --> 11:49.509
AND HER MOM JUST WANTS TO SWEEP
THE WHOLE THING UNDER THE RUG.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.944
I'D PROBABLY LIE TOO.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.179
- WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS,
WHAT'S HIS AGENDA?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.514
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT
OF SPERM DONATION

11:54.547 --> 11:55.949
WAS FIRE AND FORGET.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.184
- I COULD THINK OF
HALF A DOZEN THINGS

11:57.217 --> 11:58.485
THAT THIS GUY IS UP TO.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.419
I MEAN, THEY DID SPEND
THE NIGHT TOGETHER.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.856
- CATE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
ON HIS RADAR.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.225
I'VE BEEN TRACKING
FOUR OTHER GIRLS

12:05.258 --> 12:07.094
THAT HAVE BEEN POSTING
ON THIS FORUM

12:07.127 --> 12:08.962
ABOUT DONOR 141.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.063
SO, "ASHLEY R.,"

12:10.097 --> 12:12.132
SHE WAS RAISED
BY A SINGLE MOM.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.767
SHE LOGS ON

12:13.801 --> 12:16.203
FROM THIS HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY
COMPUTER IN BALTIMORE.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.172
SHE SAYS,
"DONOR 141 IS A GREAT MAN.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.174
"I WENT TO NEW YORK
TO MEET HIM.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.777
ALL MY SISTERS OUT THERE,
YOU SHOULD TOO."

12:23.811 --> 12:27.247
- ALL RIGHT. FIN, AMARO,
TAKE A DRIVE DOWN TO CHARM CITY.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.183
LIV, ROLLINS, GO TO
NEW YORK CRYOGENICS.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.819
- AH, I ALREADY SPOKE
TO THEM,

12:31.852 --> 12:34.054
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA COMPROMISE
DONOR CONFIDENTIALITY.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.856
- AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOR A WARRANT.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.992
- I'M SURE YOU TWO
COULD THINK OF SOMETHING.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.231
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.800
- WE THINK IT'S TIME
TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP

12:46.834 --> 12:48.201
AND BUILD A FAMILY.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.202
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.137
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS

12:50.170 --> 12:52.272
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR IN A DONOR?

12:52.305 --> 12:54.074
- WELL, DON'T YOU HAVE A BOOK
THAT WE CAN GO THROUGH?

12:54.107 --> 12:54.975
- YES, OF COURSE.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.144
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
WE DO HAVE ONE IDEA.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.147
UM, MY COUSIN USED SPERM
FROM THIS BANK,

13:00.180 --> 13:04.217
AND HER DAUGHTER BROOKE
IS JUST SO LOVELY AND SMART,

13:04.251 --> 13:06.286
AND WE WERE THINKING
IT MIGHT BE NICE--

13:06.319 --> 13:07.955
- IF THEY COULD SHARE
THE SAME GENES?

13:07.988 --> 13:09.256
I GET IT. IT HAPPENS
A LOT, ACTUALLY.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.590
SO HOW OLD IS BROOKE?

13:10.623 --> 13:11.992
- SHE'S GOTTA BE, WHAT?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.226
- 17?
- 18.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.063
NO, SHE'S ALMOST 17 NOW.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.297
- OH, I SEE.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.066
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKELY

13:19.099 --> 13:20.267
THAT WE STILL HAVE
THAT DONOR IN OUR BANK.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.869
- THAT'S WHAT I TRIED
TO TELL HER.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.270
- WELL, SHE SAID
THAT IT WAS DONOR--

13:23.303 --> 13:26.073
- IT'S DONOR 141.
- SO COULD YOU JUST CHECK?

13:26.106 --> 13:27.240
- YES, OF COURSE.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.176
- THERE'S NO HARM IN CHECKING.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.310
- THAT'S RIGHT.
OKAY.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.179
- YEAH. I'M SORRY.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.348
WE ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF DONOR 141
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.950
HE WAS VERY POPULAR.

13:36.984 --> 13:37.985
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.253
COULD YOU JUST SHOW US
HIS PROFILE?

13:40.287 --> 13:43.190
AND THEN MAYBE
WE CAN FIND SOMEONE

13:43.223 --> 13:46.626
WHOSE PROFILE
IS CLOSE TO HIS.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.329
- ALL RIGHT, WHY NOT?
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.165
- GOOD.
- YES.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.237
- OF COURSE I KNEW
THEY WERE MEETING.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.406
ASHLEY WAS ALWAYS
SO CURIOUS ABOUT HIM.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.975
- YEAH, I GOT IN CONTACT
WITH HIM THROUGH THE WEBSITE.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.278
- SO, HOW DID YOU
AND YOUR DONOR FATHER

14:05.312 --> 14:06.313
ARRANGE TO MEET?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.081
- OH, WE'D BEEN EMAILING

14:08.115 --> 14:10.617
ABOUT ME COMING TO NEW YORK
OR HIM COMING TO BALTIMORE,

14:10.650 --> 14:11.418
AND THEN
MY SCHOOL THEATRE GROUP

14:11.451 --> 14:12.953
TOOK A TRIP
TO THE CITY LAST YEAR.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.421
MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.023
- SO WHAT CAN YOU
TELL US ABOUT HIM?

14:16.056 --> 14:20.527
- UM, DR. BAKER,
HE'S--HE'S AMAZING.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.529
BUT HE HAS A FAMILY
OF HIS OWN,

14:22.562 --> 14:24.364
SAYS THEY CAN'T KNOW
ABOUT ME.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.400
- SO WHAT DID YOU
AND DR. BAKER TALK ABOUT?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.937
- UM, HE TOLD ME
ABOUT HIS WORK.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.671
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST DOCTORS
IN NEW YORK.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.041
EX-VIVO LUNG TRANSPLANTS.

14:34.074 --> 14:34.841
SAVES LIVES.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.911
HE TOLD ME
HE FEELS CLOSE TO GOD

14:37.945 --> 14:40.647
WHEN HE HOLDS SOMEONE'S LIFE
IN HIS HANDS.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.915
I ONLY MET HIM THE ONCE.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.984
IT WAS IN BETWEEN SHOWS.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.685
THEN I WENT WITH MY CLASS
TO SEE, UM,

14:45.718 --> 14:47.988
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.689
- SHE BROUGHT ME
A SIGNED PLAYBILL.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.258
- YEAH.
[laughs]

14:51.291 --> 14:52.659
- HMM. YOU KNOW, MY WIFE,
SHE MADE ME GO TO THAT.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.294
[laughs]

14:54.327 --> 14:56.596
HEY, WASN'T IT SAD WHEN THEY
SENT THAT GUY TO PRISON

14:56.629 --> 14:57.664
FOR STEALING BREAD?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.566
- YEAH, THAT WAS
REALLY SAD.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.368
- YEAH, RIGHT?

15:01.401 --> 15:02.535
[baby crying]

15:02.569 --> 15:05.672
- OH, BRENDAN'S UP.
COULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

15:05.705 --> 15:08.541
- YEAH, SURE.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.043
BRENDAN?

15:10.077 --> 15:11.544
- ASHLEY'S BABY.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.513
SHE HAD TO
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.283
- TEEN MOM.
THAT'S A TOUGH GIG.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.418
IS THE BABY'S DAD
STILL IN THE PICTURE?

15:18.451 --> 15:22.089
- JOEY?
UH, WELL, SORT OF.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.024
[laughs]

15:24.057 --> 15:26.459
HE'S JUST A KID HIMSELF.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.495
SHY, SICKLY.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.998
THE OTHER KIDS BULLY HIM.

15:31.031 --> 15:34.001
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT HIM

15:34.034 --> 15:35.402
AROUND MY DAUGHTER.

15:35.435 --> 15:39.039
- AH, THERE HE IS.
[laughs]

15:39.072 --> 15:40.707
HE'S ADORABLE.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.575
WHAT IS HE,
THREE MONTHS OLD?

15:42.609 --> 15:43.977
- YEAH, JUST ABOUT.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.645
AW, BUDDY.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.981
- GOT A LITTLE...
RUNNY NOSE.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.682
THERE YOU GO, PAL.

15:49.716 --> 15:53.053
- I'M GONNA TAKE HIM BACK
TO GET CHANGED.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.654
- OH. I SHOULD GO
HELP ASHLEY--

15:54.687 --> 15:56.323
- OF COURSE.
- WITH THE BABY.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.058
- SURE.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.596
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO
STOLEN BREAD IN PHANTOM.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.597
ASHLEY COULD HAVE BEEN
SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT NIGHT.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.466
- PROBABLY WITH
THE DONOR DAD.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.634
AND DO THE MATH.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.370
THE BABY WAS BORN
NINE MONTHS LATER.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.739
MAYBE SHY JOEY
ISN'T THE FATHER.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.742
- WELL,
THIS SHOULD TELL US.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.444
- SO WE'RE SAYING
A DONOR FATHER

16:17.477 --> 16:20.647
HAD A CHILD WITH
HIS BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.482
- THEY'RE TESTING
THE BABY'S DNA NOW.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.750
I HOPE I'M WRONG.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.618
- WHAT KIND OF PREDATOR
ARE WE LOOKING AT?

16:25.652 --> 16:28.155
- WELL, IT COULD BE A PREDATOR,
OR IT COULD BE GSA.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.756
GENETIC SEXUAL ATTRACTION.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.359
WHEN CHILDREN
ARE SEPARATED EARLY

16:32.392 --> 16:33.626
FROM THEIR
BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES

16:33.660 --> 16:35.528
AND THEN REUNITED
MANY YEARS LATER,

16:35.562 --> 16:37.597
SOMETIMES THERE ARE
OVERWHELMING FEELINGS

16:37.630 --> 16:38.598
OF SEXUAL ATTRACTION.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.133
THIS CAN HAPPEN
BETWEEN SIBLINGS

16:40.167 --> 16:42.102
OR BETWEEN
A FATHER AND DAUGHTER.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.770
- DO WE HAVE ANYTHING
FROM THE DONOR PROFILE?

16:43.803 --> 16:47.507
- WE DO. UH, HE IS 6'1",
BROWN HAIR, BLUE EYES.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.177
CORNELL UNDERGRAD,
'93, PRE-MED.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.112
- AND HE TOLD ASHLEY
HE WAS A DOCTOR.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.047
THE NAME HE USED
WAS CALVIN BAKER.

16:54.081 --> 16:58.118
- THEY SAID HE WAS AN EX-VIVO
LUNG TRANSPLANT SPECIALIST.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.719
WORKED IN THE CITY
AS OF LAST MEMORIAL DAY.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.421
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
FOR THAT NAME,

17:01.454 --> 17:05.525
BUT EX-VIVO DOCS, CORNELL,
THAT'S GOTTA BE A SMALL POOL.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.060
LET'S SEE.
YEAH, THERE'S ONE.

17:07.094 --> 17:10.197
COLIN BARNES, CORNELL,
CLASS OF 1993.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.600
- HERE WE GO.
"SURGEON AT GROLLIER LEMAY.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.802
EX-VIVO LUNG TRANSPLANT
SPECIALIST."

17:15.835 --> 17:19.406
- AND THERE'S A TON OF HITS
FOR HIM ON THE WEB. LOOK.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.408
HERE'S A VIDEO.
- THAT WAS QUICK.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.809
- GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND,
MUNCH.

17:22.842 --> 17:26.446
- I WAS BLESSED TO BE ABLE
TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE

17:26.479 --> 17:28.481
AND SAVE THE SENATOR'S LIFE.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.716
A MIRACLE,

17:29.749 --> 17:32.552
TO BE ABLE TO HOLD SOMEONE'S
LIFE IN YOUR HANDS LIKE THAT.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.188
I FELT CLOSE TO GOD.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.689
- "CLOSE TO GOD."

17:36.723 --> 17:38.158
THE SAME WORDS
HE USED WITH ASHLEY.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.659
- YEAH, WELL,

17:39.692 --> 17:43.130
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED TO PAY
THIS DOCTOR A HOUSE CALL.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.867
- DR. BARNES.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.170
- EXCUSE ME.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.838
CAN I HELP YOU?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.673
- UM, THESE ARE DETECTIVES.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.442
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

17:55.475 --> 17:59.446
- UH, WE SHOULD TALK
PRIVATELY.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.681
- IT'S OKAY.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.183
[clears throat]

18:03.216 --> 18:03.950
QUICKLY, PLEASE.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.685
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN EVENT.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.520
- WELL, IT'S ABOUT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

18:07.554 --> 18:09.722
WITH THE DAUGHTERS YOU FATHERED
AS A SPERM DONOR.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.125
- THERE'S SOME MISTAKE.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.560
- WELL, THEN,
YOU'LL WANT TO CLEAR IT UP,

18:13.593 --> 18:16.463
SO WE CAN TALK HERE OR WE COULD
GO BACK TO THE PRECINCT,

18:16.496 --> 18:17.530
WHERE WE HAVE MORE PRIVACY.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.898
- DAD, WHAT'S WRONG?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.867
- TAYLOR, DARLING, I'M SURE
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.204
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
THE POLICE JUST NEED MY HELP.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.605
IT'S OKAY. ALL RIGHT?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.707
YOU GO BACK TO THE PARTY,
ALL RIGHT?

18:27.740 --> 18:28.741
[kiss]

18:28.775 --> 18:30.777
IT'S OKAY.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.582
IS SOMEBODY TRYING
TO CONTACT ME?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.617
BECAUSE I DONATED
ON THE CONDITION OF ANONYMITY.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.719
- SO YOU'VE NEVER CONTACTED
ANY OF YOUR OFFSPRING?

18:39.752 --> 18:43.490
- NO. AND I HAVEN'T EVEN
TOLD MY WIFE THAT I WAS A DONOR.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.225
AND IF SOMEBODY'S
TRYING TO FIND ME,

18:45.258 --> 18:47.594
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WOULD I AGREE TO THAT.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.929
- SO WHERE WERE YOU
THURSDAY NIGHT?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.498
- I WAS HOME
WITH MY FAMILY.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.599
- SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN

18:52.632 --> 18:56.236
WHY THERE'S A ROOM CHARGED
THAT NIGHT

18:56.269 --> 18:58.238
AT THE EMPIRE HOTEL

18:58.271 --> 18:59.506
ON YOUR CREDIT CARD?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.608
NOW, THAT IS YOU, RIGHT?
DR. COLIN BARNES?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.276
- YES, BUT I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A MASTERCARD.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.844
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

19:04.877 --> 19:09.716
- THREE OF DONOR 141's DAUGHTERS
TOLD US THAT THEY MET YOU.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.852
THEY SAID THAT YOU TOLD THEM

19:12.885 --> 19:14.687
THAT YOU WERE
AN EX-VIVO LUNG SURGEON

19:14.721 --> 19:17.524
AND HOW HOLDING A LIFE
IN YOUR HAND

19:17.557 --> 19:18.658
MAKES YOU FEEL CLOSE TO GOD.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.560
DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

19:20.593 --> 19:23.663
- SOMEBODY IS TRYING
TO EXTORT MONEY.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.764
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE.

19:24.797 --> 19:29.602
AND IF ANY GIRL SAYS
THAT SHE MET ME, SHE'S LYING.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.971
- THAT'S WHAT I TOLD
MY PARTNER.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.640
IT--IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.275
- OKAY, SO THEN,
YOU WON'T MIND

19:35.308 --> 19:37.610
SUBMITTING TO A LINEUP
AND A DNA TEST?

19:37.644 --> 19:38.978
- DON'T SAY ANYTHING MORE,
COLIN.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.947
I NEED TO CONSULT
WITH MY CLIENT.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.950
- THAT'S FINE, BUT IF
HE DOESN'T COOPERATE,

19:43.983 --> 19:45.652
IT MAKES US THINK HE HAS
SOMETHING TO HIDE.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.587
- THANKS.
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.856
CAN WE HAVE THE ROOM,
OLIVIA?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.926
- NUMBER SIX,
PLEASE STEP FORWARD.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.902
- NO. NONE OF THESE GUYS
IS MY DONOR FATHER.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.237
THEY'RE ALL TOO OLD.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.972
- ASHLEY,
IT WAS A YEAR AGO.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.241
- I'M POSITIVE.
HE'S NOT HERE.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.209
- MOVING ON, DETECTIVES.

20:11.043 --> 20:15.582
- NO. MY FATHER
HAD NICER EYES.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.850
- ARE YOU SURE, MELISSA?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.619
- I'M SURE.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.989
- NO.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.791
- CATE, WE NEED YOU
TO BE CERTAIN.

20:24.824 --> 20:25.992
- I'M TELLING YOU,

20:26.025 --> 20:27.694
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY
OF THESE GUYS BEFORE.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.028
- WE'RE DONE HERE,
DETECTIVES.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.597
THREE FOR THREE.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.632
I'M TAKING MY CLIENT HOME.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.004
- RIGHT HEIGHT, BUILD.
IT COULD BE BARNES.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.707
- WELL, HIS WIFE ALIBIS HIM
FOR THAT NIGHT,

20:40.740 --> 20:42.675
BUT WIVES LIE.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.345
- NONE OF THESE OTHER GIRLS
IDed COLIN BARNES?

20:45.378 --> 20:46.813
ARE THEY ALL PROTECTING HIM?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.415
- IF THEY HAD SEX WITH HIM,
THEY MIGHT BE.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.318
- BUSY GUY, SUCCESSFUL SURGEON,
FAMILY MAN.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.853
HE HAS TIME TO SEEK OUT AND
SEDUCE HIS DONOR DAUGHTERS?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.788
- WELL, HE DOES HAVE
A GOD COMPLEX.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.757
- WE'RE TRACKING
THE HOTEL ROOM CHARGES.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.359
HE CLAIMS THE CARD'S
NOT HIS.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.694
BUT THE BILLING ADDRESS
IS TO A POST OFFICE BOX

21:01.728 --> 21:03.062
A BLOCK AWAY
FROM HIS HOSPITAL.

21:03.095 --> 21:03.930
- AND WE'VE GOT TO WAIT
FOR THE LAB

21:03.963 --> 21:06.366
TO PROCESS THE DNA
ON ASHLEY'S BABY,

21:06.399 --> 21:07.233
COLIN, AND THE GIRLS.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.769
- AND WHAT IF HE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH?

21:09.802 --> 21:12.672
AND WHO DID THESE GIRLS
MEET WITH?

21:18.044 --> 21:18.878
- I'M NOT PROTECTING
ANYBODY.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.381
MY FATHER WASN'T IN THE LINEUP.
- NO.

21:21.414 --> 21:25.051
YOU SEE,
DONOR 141 WAS THERE,

21:25.084 --> 21:26.919
AND THAT WE'RE SURE ABOUT.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.723
- WHAT? CAN'T BE.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.793
- THE MAN THAT YOU MET WITH
ON THURSDAY NIGHT

21:33.826 --> 21:37.697
IS NOT
YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.767
- BUT--BUT WE LOOK ALIKE.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.103
AND EVERYTHING HE TOLD ME
MATCHED THE PROFILE.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.673
- WHAT ELSE DID HE TELL YOU?

21:46.706 --> 21:53.012
- THAT HE'D BEEN TRYING TO GET
IN CONTACT WITH ME FOR YEARS,

21:53.045 --> 21:55.014
BUT MY MOTHER
WOULDN'T LET HIM.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.484
SHE WAS SO AFRAID
OF LOSING ME

21:57.517 --> 22:00.086
THAT SHE WOULDN'T
LET ME SEE MY REAL FATHER.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.855
- HE WAS WEARING RUNNING SHOES
WHEN I MET HIM.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.991
HE WAS TRAINING
FOR A MARATHON.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.494
I'M ON THE CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM
AT SCHOOL.

22:07.527 --> 22:11.030
I TOLD HIM THAT, AND HE SAID
HE WASN'T SURPRISED.

22:11.063 --> 22:12.399
BECAUSE OF MY GENES.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.467
- OH.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.969
MELISSA, HAD YOU POSTED ANYTHING
ABOUT CROSS-COUNTRY

22:17.003 --> 22:18.371
ON YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE?

22:18.405 --> 22:21.474
- NO. WE--WE CONNECTED.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.411
HE SAID HE ALWAYS WANTED TO
MEET ME, TO GET TO KNOW ME.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.078
- THEY WHY'D HE GIVE YOU
A FAKE NAME?

22:29.048 --> 22:31.718
- YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT HIM.

22:31.751 --> 22:36.022
THE SECOND I SAW HIM,
HE WAS THE DAD I'D DREAMED OF.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.859
HE TOOK ME TO A RESTAURANT,
TREATED ME LIKE A GROWNUP.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.995
WE SPOKE FRENCH.

22:43.029 --> 22:47.534
- UH, WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER DINNER?

22:47.567 --> 22:50.970
- WE WENT BACK TO HIS HOTEL.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.573
WE--WE DANCED.

22:55.942 --> 22:59.045
AND, THEN I KNEW
IT WAS WRONG,

22:59.078 --> 23:03.550
THAT HE WAS
MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.553
I DIDN'T CARE.

23:06.586 --> 23:10.557
I HAD TO BE WITH HIM.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.592
I WANTED TO BE CLOSE TO HIM.

23:16.095 --> 23:20.800
- SO, BRENDAN, YOUR BABY,

23:20.833 --> 23:22.435
IT'S HIS?

23:24.504 --> 23:28.007
- IT WAS LIKE HE KNEW ME,
AND I WANTED TO BE WITH HIM.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.042
- SO YOU SPENT
THE WEEKEND TOGETHER.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.043
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.481
WE JUST HELD EACH OTHER.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.182
HE ASKED ME
TO DANCE WITH HIM.

23:36.215 --> 23:39.886
HE PLAYED THIS SONG.
IT WAS SO ROMANTIC.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.890
I FELT LIKE
I WAS IN LOVE.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.058
HE SAID THAT WE COULD NEVER
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN

23:46.092 --> 23:48.194
BUT THAT WE'D ALWAYS BE
IN EACH OTHER'S HEARTS.

23:48.227 --> 23:51.998
- HE TOLD ME HE WANTED
ONE THING IN LIFE--

23:52.031 --> 23:54.501
TO GIVE ME AWAY
AT MY WEDDING.

23:54.534 --> 23:57.169
TO WALK ME DOWN THE AISLE.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.205
HE WANTED TO DANCE WITH ME,

23:59.238 --> 24:02.141
LIKE FATHERS DO
WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS.

24:02.174 --> 24:05.878
HE PLAYED THIS AWESOME SONG.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.481
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT SONG IT WAS?

24:08.515 --> 24:10.817
- MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.118
- OKAY.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.087
SO, CATE, AFTER YOU
DANCED TOGETHER,

24:15.121 --> 24:16.656
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:21.594 --> 24:23.129
- WE KISSED.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.199
I KNEW PEOPLE
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND,

24:27.233 --> 24:31.938
BEING WITH MY FATHER
LIKE THAT,

24:31.971 --> 24:33.172
BUT I DIDN'T CARE.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.110
- DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH HIM?

24:38.144 --> 24:42.582
- YES.

24:42.615 --> 24:45.184
BUT--

24:45.217 --> 24:50.222
BUT I THOUGHT
HE REALLY LOVED ME,

24:50.256 --> 24:53.926
THAT HE WAS
MY REAL FATHER,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.962
THE ONE THAT I'D BEEN
WAITING FOR.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.534
BUT HE WASN'T?

25:05.271 --> 25:08.240
OH, MY GOD.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.249
I'M SORRY, DADDY.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.151
DADDY.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.920
- IT'S OKAY, BABY.
IT'S OKAY.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.221
- [crying]

25:28.194 --> 25:30.597
- HEY, SO THE DNA RESULTS
CAME IN.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.700
COLIN BARNES IS THE FATHER
OF CATE, MELISSA, AND ASHLEY.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.702
- ASHLEY'S BABY?
- NOT HIS.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.170
AND IT'S NOT
JOEY COHEN'S EITHER.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.640
AND WHOEVER THE FATHER IS,
HIS DNA ISN'T IN THE SYSTEM.

25:40.673 --> 25:44.043
- ALSO, I CHECKED BARNES'
CALENDAR FOR THE PAST YEAR,

25:44.076 --> 25:45.111
AND LAST MEMORIAL DAY
WEEKEND,

25:45.144 --> 25:48.280
HE AND HIS FAMILY WERE
RENTING A VILLA IN TUSCANY.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.016
- ALL RIGHT.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.151
SO THE GIRLS WEREN'T SLEEPING
WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

25:52.184 --> 25:53.920
BUT SOMEONE POSING
AS THEIR FATHER?

25:53.953 --> 25:55.655
- CATE'S DEVASTATED.
- SO IS ASHLEY.

25:55.688 --> 25:58.691
WHOEVER DID THIS,
HE KNOWS HOW TO SEDUCE.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.326
- ACTUALLY, HE KNOWS
WHO TO SEDUCE.

26:00.359 --> 26:03.162
TWO OF THESE GIRLS FANTASIZED
THEIR WHOLE LIFE

26:03.195 --> 26:05.197
ABOUT THE FATHER
THEY NEVER KNEW.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.198
- AND CATE HAD
JUST FOUND OUT

26:06.232 --> 26:08.334
THAT THE MAN SHE THOUGHT
WAS HER FATHER WASN'T.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.335
- DESPERATE
FOR A FATHER'S LOVE.

26:09.368 --> 26:10.937
THE PERFECT PREY.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.071
- THE MOMENT THEY MET HIM,
THEY WERE VULNERABLE.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.339
OVERCOME WITH EMOTIONS,

26:13.372 --> 26:15.307
THEIR INHIBITIONS
JUST DISAPPEARED.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.343
- SO THIS GOES BEYOND
GENETIC SEXUAL ATTRACTION

26:17.376 --> 26:18.210
OR STATUTORY RAPE.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.379
WE'RE DEALING WITH
A SOCIOPATH HERE.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.281
- LET'S GET A SKETCH ARTIST
TO WORK WITH THE GIRLS

26:22.314 --> 26:23.683
AND GET AN I.D.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.251
- YOU KNOW,
WHOEVER THIS IS

26:25.284 --> 26:27.620
KNOWS AN AWFUL LOT
ABOUT COLIN BARNES.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.288
OPENING A CREDIT CARD
IN HIS NAME?

26:29.321 --> 26:30.657
- GO BACK TO BARNES.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.291
SEE WHO HAS A VENDETTA
AGAINST HIM.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.729
- TAYLOR.
- COME ON, SWEETIE.

26:36.763 --> 26:37.730
COME BACK, MY LOVE.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.065
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

26:39.098 --> 26:41.267
- WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU'RE SICK, DADDY.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.268
- OH, TAYLOR, PLEASE.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.203
- HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE?

26:44.236 --> 26:46.806
A HUNDRED? MORE?

26:46.839 --> 26:49.642
I COULD BE DATING
ONE OF MY OWN BROTHERS.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.643
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS.

26:50.677 --> 26:51.711
I'M LEAVING.

26:51.744 --> 26:52.544
- TAYLOR, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

26:52.578 --> 26:55.648
- NO. YOU CAN'T
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

26:55.682 --> 26:58.785
- SHE'S RIGHT.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

26:58.818 --> 27:01.187
- DR. BARNES, WE NEED
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.155
- HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:03.189 --> 27:04.390
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE
RIGHT NOW.

27:04.423 --> 27:05.692
- WE UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE ANGRY,

27:05.725 --> 27:06.759
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW,

27:06.793 --> 27:08.194
SOMEONE RAPED
YOUR DONOR DAUGHTERS

27:08.227 --> 27:09.328
AND DID IT IN YOUR NAME.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.063
- OH, MY GOD.

27:11.097 --> 27:14.300
- MRS. BARNES, WHY DON'T WE
SIT DOWN AND TALK, OKAY?

27:14.333 --> 27:16.302
COME ON.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.772
- I SAVE LIVES.
I'M HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.273
MY COLLEAGUES RESPECT ME.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.342
AND MY PATIENTS,
THEY ALMOST WORSHIP ME.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.443
- SO YOU CAN'T THINK
OF ANYONE

27:24.476 --> 27:26.178
WHO'D WANT TO GET BACK
AT YOU?

27:26.212 --> 27:28.047
- COLIN, HAVE YOU TOLD THEM
ABOUT PHILIP KELLY?

27:28.080 --> 27:29.148
- PHILIP? THAT HACK?

27:29.181 --> 27:32.151
- IT'S A FELLOW SURGEON
THAT COLIN FIRED A YEAR AGO.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.152
- TELL HER.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.353
- YEAH, LAST EASTER,

27:34.386 --> 27:36.455
WE WERE AT PHILIP'S BIRTHDAY
PARTY IN THE HAMPTONS AND--

27:36.488 --> 27:37.523
- I WAS PREGNANT.

27:37.556 --> 27:40.459
I FELT QUEASY, AND PHILIP
POURED ME A GINGER ALE.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.294
COLIN SAW HIS HAND SHAKE.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.431
- AN OBVIOUS
INTENTION TREMOR.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.133
YOU KNOW, THANK GOD
THE HOSPITAL

27:47.166 --> 27:49.702
WASN'T SLAPPED
WITH A MALPRACTICE SUIT.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.404
THE NEXT DAY, I TOLD PHILIP
I HAD TO LET HIM GO.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.807
- HOW'D HE TAKE THAT?
- NOT WELL.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.710
WE WERE IN MEDICAL SCHOOL
TOGETHER AND, UH,

27:57.744 --> 28:00.246
HE THOUGHT THAT MEANT
I'D LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

28:04.817 --> 28:08.087
- PHILIP KELLY?
NYPD.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.258
- THAT'S JUST GREAT.
WHAT DID I DO NOW?

28:12.291 --> 28:13.359
- WHERE WERE YOU
LAST WEEKEND?

28:13.392 --> 28:15.361
- STUCK AT NORTH JERSEY
STATE PRISON,

28:15.394 --> 28:18.397
PULLING A GRAVEYARD SHIFT
IN THE HOSPITAL WING.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.500
YOU CAN CHECK WITH
MY SON-OF-A-BITCH SUPERVISOR.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.468
- OKAY, WE WILL.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.104
TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT COLIN BARNES.

28:25.137 --> 28:28.207
- THE BASTARD
WHO RUINED MY CAREER?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.242
SANCTIMONIOUS PRICK.

28:30.276 --> 28:33.179
- THERE'S THAT INTENTION TREMOR
THAT HE NOTICED.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.382
- LOOK, I WAS ON HALDOL.
I HAD IT UNDER CONTROL.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.318
- YEAH, BUT HE FOUND OUT
ABOUT IT AT YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.354
- I HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS--
EXCUSE ME--AT MY BIRTHDAY.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.523
- AND BARNES FIRED YOU
THE NEXT DAY.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.358
I'D HATE A GUY LIKE THAT.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.495
- I DO. BUT NOT JUST ME.
NOBODY LIKES THAT GUY.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.163
- THAT'S RIGHT,
'CAUSE YOU AND COLIN

28:51.197 --> 28:53.132
WENT TO
MED SCHOOL TOGETHER, SO--

28:53.165 --> 28:54.300
HEY, DID YOU KNOW ANYTHING

28:54.333 --> 28:56.202
ABOUT HIM BEING A--
A SPERM DONOR?

28:56.235 --> 28:57.236
- HOW COULD I NOT?

28:57.269 --> 28:59.371
HE BRAGGED ABOUT IT TO ANYBODY
WHO WOULD LISTEN.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.274
- SO, AFTER HE FIRED YOU,
IS THAT WHEN YOU DECIDED

29:02.308 --> 29:04.376
TO MAKE CONTACT WITH
HIS DONOR DAUGHTERS?

29:04.410 --> 29:06.412
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:06.445 --> 29:10.149
LOOK, THE ONLY DAUGHTER I KNOW
IS THE TEENAGER,

29:10.182 --> 29:11.884
AND SHE EVEN THINKS
HE'S A BLOWHARD.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.920
SHE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT HIM
AT MY PARTY.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.255
- TO YOU?
- NO. SOME GUY.

29:16.288 --> 29:19.558
I--I WAS DRUNK.
I DON'T REMEMBER WHO.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.427
TOLD ME HE GOT AN EARFUL.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.399
[My One And Only Love playing]

29:27.433 --> 29:32.504
*

29:32.538 --> 29:34.306
- IT'S OKAY, TAYLOR.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.209
- I COULDN'T TAKE
ANOTHER MINUTE IN THAT HOUSE.

29:37.243 --> 29:41.447
HE'S A LIAR.

29:41.480 --> 29:47.186
HE'S BEEN LYING TO ME
MY WHOLE LIFE.

29:47.219 --> 29:50.256
- LISTEN.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.492
DON'T WORRY.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.995
YOU'RE WITH ME NOW.

29:58.264 --> 30:01.467
- * LIKE AN APRIL BREEZE

30:01.500 --> 30:06.538
* ON THE WINGS OF SPRING

30:06.572 --> 30:14.246
* AND YOU APPEAR
IN ALL YOUR SPLENDOR *

30:14.280 --> 30:18.317
* MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE

30:23.990 --> 30:24.991
- LOOK, SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
TO MY DAUGHTER.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.225
SHE DIDN'T COME HOME
YESTERDAY,

30:26.258 --> 30:27.026
AND SHE'S NEVER DONE THAT
IN HER LIFE.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.594
- DOES TAYLOR
HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

30:28.627 --> 30:29.962
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE TIME
FOR BOYS.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.330
SHE'S EARLY ADMISSION
TO BROWN, PRE-MED.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.598
- THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.934
- YEAH, SHE THRIVES ON IT.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.469
TAYLOR WOULD NEVER RUN AWAY
TO HURT ME.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.570
SHE'S TOO MATURE.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.040
SOMETHING TERRIBLE'S
GOING ON.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.509
- WELL, YOU SAW HER.
SHE STORMED OUT OF HERE.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.944
SHE MUST HAVE LEFT
HER CELL PHONE.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.512
- DID SHE MENTION
MEETING ANYONE?

30:46.545 --> 30:49.949
- NO. SHE JUST LEFT.
AND SHE WAS REALLY ANGRY.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.388
- IS YOUR DAUGHTER
A JAZZ FAN?

30:56.422 --> 30:59.058
- JAZZ? NO.
NO. SHE HATES JAZZ.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.293
SHE AND COLIN
LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC.

31:01.327 --> 31:05.932
- SOMEONE EMAILED HER
THIS SONG YESTERDAY.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.466
YOU KNOW ANYONE
NAMED CYRANO?

31:07.499 --> 31:11.971
- NO. NO, THIS ISN'T MUSIC
SHE LISTENS TO.

31:12.004 --> 31:15.274
I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS SONG
FOR YEARS.

31:15.307 --> 31:18.410
- BUT YOU DO KNOW IT?

31:18.444 --> 31:19.979
- UH, YEAH.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.014
A GUY I DATED AT CORNELL,
BEFORE COLIN. SEAN.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.549
HE USED TO PLAY IT
ALL THE TIME.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.585
HE WANTED TO DANCE TO IT.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.555
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW SEAN?

31:29.588 --> 31:31.457
- NOT FOR YEARS.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.292
- WELL, IS THERE ANY WAY THAT
HE WOULD KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER?

31:33.325 --> 31:37.029
- I DON'T SEE HOW.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.464
WELL, WAIT.

31:38.497 --> 31:43.302
UH, THERE WAS
THAT PARTY, UH, LAST EASTER.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.703
PHILIP KELLY'S BIRTHDAY.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.305
- OKAY, WELL,
PHILIP TOLD US

31:46.338 --> 31:49.308
THAT HE SAW A MAN TALKING
TO TAYLOR AT THAT PARTY.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.543
WAS IT SEAN?

31:51.577 --> 31:54.480
- POSSIBLY.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.948
OH, MY GOD.

31:55.982 --> 31:58.050
DOES HE HAVE TAYLOR?

31:58.084 --> 32:00.586
THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S SEAN ALBERS.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.121
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE
PICKED HIM UP?

32:02.154 --> 32:03.122
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:03.155 --> 32:04.456
- WELL,
HIS APARTMENT'S EMPTY.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.658
- HE WORKS FOR A MEDICAL
SUPPLY COMPANY, OKAY?

32:06.692 --> 32:08.060
HE'S ON THE ROAD.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.062
- TARU SAYS HIS PHONE'S OFF.
NO GPS.

32:10.096 --> 32:13.499
WE TRACED THE CYRANO
EMAIL ADDRESS BACK TO SEAN.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.067
- WHY ARE THEY EMAILING
EACH OTHER?

32:15.101 --> 32:18.004
- SO, WHAT? WHAT, WE JUST SIT
HERE ON OUR ASSES?

32:18.037 --> 32:19.071
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT
UP FOR THIS,

32:19.105 --> 32:20.472
WHY DON'T YOU CALL
THE FBI, HUH?

32:20.506 --> 32:22.341
- TAKE IT EASY, COLIN.
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM?

32:22.374 --> 32:24.543
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON
THAT HE WOULD WANT TO HURT YOU?

32:24.576 --> 32:25.611
- WE BARELY KNEW HIM.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.546
THE GUY WAS A LOSER.
HE'S PROBABLY JUST JEALOUS.

32:27.579 --> 32:30.116
- THIS IS MORE VINDICTIVE
THAN SIMPLE JEALOUSY.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.450
IT SEEMS VERY PERSONAL.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.352
- AND YOU SAID
THAT YOU DATED HIM IN COLLEGE?

32:33.385 --> 32:36.055
- THAT WAS 20 YEARS AGO.
THEY BARELY WENT OUT.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.157
- I WASN'T ASKING YOU.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.093
IS THAT RIGHT, ANNE?

32:41.127 --> 32:43.062
- HE COULD BE UNDER
THE IMPRESSION

32:43.095 --> 32:45.497
THAT COLIN STOLE ME AWAY.

32:45.531 --> 32:48.367
AFTER I BROKE IT OFF WITH SEAN,
COLIN ASKED ME OUT.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.968
- YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS?

32:52.404 --> 32:55.041
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW I REMEMBER.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.476
HE WAS CAUGHT CHEATING.
- ON HIS MCATs?

32:57.509 --> 32:59.711
- NO. ACTUALLY, HE WAS TAKING
THE TEST FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.148
I WALKED IN TO TAKE MINE
AND I SAW HIM SITTING THERE

33:02.181 --> 33:04.116
AND I KNEW HE HAD ALREADY
TAKEN HIS OWN TEST,

33:04.150 --> 33:05.384
SO I ASKED HIM WHAT THE HELL
HE WAS DOING,

33:05.417 --> 33:07.119
AND HE SAID,
"MAKING 350 BUCKS."

33:07.153 --> 33:10.056
- SO YOU BLEW THE WHISTLE
ON HIM.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.124
- DAMN RIGHT I DID.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.660
- HE'S TEXTING ME. SEAN.
- WHAT?

33:14.693 --> 33:17.663
- HE WANTS TO SEE ME.
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

33:17.696 --> 33:18.797
- NO, IT'S NOT RIDICULOUS.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.167
HE SAYS IF I DON'T COME,
I'LL NEVER SEE TAYLOR AGAIN.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.110
- POLICE.
WHERE'S THE GIRL, SEAN?

33:31.143 --> 33:32.678
- LOOKS LIKE I GOT
YOUR ATTENTION.

33:32.711 --> 33:33.612
- ARE YOU DEAF?

33:33.645 --> 33:35.114
YOU HEARD MY PARTNER
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.415
- WHERE'S ANNE?

33:36.448 --> 33:38.184
- NO, YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.
YOU ANSWER THEM.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.551
- NO, I ONLY TALK TO ANNE.

33:39.585 --> 33:40.586
I THINK I WAS PRETTY CLEAR
ABOUT THAT IN MY TEXT.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.088
- OKAY, YOU WANT TO PLAY IT
LIKE THAT, CYRANO?

33:42.121 --> 33:43.455
GET UP. LET'S GO.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.728
- WHERE'S TAYLOR, SEAN?

33:49.761 --> 33:52.598
- I'LL ONLY TALK TO ANNE.
WHERE IS SHE?

33:52.631 --> 33:54.133
- ANNE'S ON HER WAY.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.534
- THEN I'LL WAIT.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.837
- OKAY. YOU HAVE TAYLOR,
YOU HOLD ALL THE CARDS.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.106
WE GET IT.
- I DON'T HAVE TAYLOR.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.807
TAYLOR WANTS TO BE WITH ME.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.710
- RIGHT. SHE CONTACTED YOU.
- YES.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.578
SHE OBVIOUSLY NEEDS ME
RIGHT NOW.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.114
- YOU TWO ARE CLOSE.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.516
- WE SHARED A CONNECTION
FROM THE MOMENT WE MET.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.683
- AT PHILIP'S PARTY.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.586
SHE WAS WHAT, 15?

34:14.620 --> 34:17.189
SHE'S A LOVELY GIRL.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.158
- BEAUTIFUL.
- YEAH.

34:19.191 --> 34:21.260
- SPECIAL.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.561
YOU KNOW,
FOR A FEW SECONDS,

34:22.594 --> 34:24.196
I COULD HAVE SWORN
I WAS LOOKING AT ANNE.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.598
- SO YOU STRUCK UP
A CONVERSATION,

34:26.632 --> 34:28.600
TOLD HER YOU KNEW
HER PARENTS.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.702
- WELL, SHE WAS JUST HAPPY TO
HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

34:30.736 --> 34:34.706
COLIN WAS BUSY PONTIFICATING,
ANNE WAS PREGNANT, DISTRACTED.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.775
- HAVEN'T WE SEEN ENOUGH
OF THIS CHARADE?

34:36.808 --> 34:38.577
- THE DETECTIVES KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

34:38.610 --> 34:42.114
EMPATHY, PROJECTION.
THEY'RE GETTING HIM TO TALK.

34:42.148 --> 34:45.217
- ALL TAYLOR NEEDED WAS SOMEONE
TO LISTEN TO HER, TO SEE HER.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.685
NOT LIKE HER FATHER,

34:46.718 --> 34:48.520
WHO WANTS HER ON THE SHELF
LIKE SOME IVY LEAGUE TROPHY.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.589
- SO YOU GAVE HER
THE ATTENTION.

34:50.622 --> 34:54.793
LIKE THE ATTENTION THAT YOU GAVE
TO COLIN'S OTHER DAUGHTERS.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.695
HIS DONOR DAUGHTERS.

35:07.273 --> 35:10.276
- I KNEW HE HAD
DONATED SPERM IN COLLEGE.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.880
AFTER TALKING TO TAYLOR AND
SEEING HOW LONELY SHE WAS,

35:14.913 --> 35:16.815
I STARTED WONDERING
ABOUT HIS OTHER DAUGHTERS.

35:16.848 --> 35:23.255
- WELL, IT'S NOT AS IF HE CARED
ABOUT ANY OF THEM, RIGHT?

35:23.289 --> 35:25.824
- THAT GUY...

35:25.857 --> 35:27.926
BEATING
THE BISHOP FOR A LIVING,

35:27.959 --> 35:30.529
PLAYING GOD.

35:30.562 --> 35:31.530
HE'S GOT A HUNDRED KIDS
OUT THERE.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.200
HE NEVER THOUGHT
FOR ONE SECOND WHAT IT MEANT

35:34.233 --> 35:36.535
FOR THEM TO GROW UP
WITH A HOLE IN THEIR LIVES.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.770
IN PAIN.
FATHERLESS.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.273
- SO YOU BECAME THAT FATHER.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.942
YOU WENT ONLINE
TO THE DONOR WEBSITE,

35:43.975 --> 35:47.646
YOU POSED AS DONOR 141,
ARRANGED TO MEET THE GIRLS.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.716
- I JUST WANTED TO GIVE THEM
A FATHER'S LOVE.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.318
- SURE.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.856
- THE EMOTIONS
WERE SO STRONG.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.259
THEY NEEDED MORE...

36:03.629 --> 36:06.398
SO I GAVE THEM
WHAT THEY NEEDED.

36:07.633 --> 36:10.702
I WAS A BETTER FATHER
THAN HE EVER WAS.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.305
HE DOESN'T DESERVE DAUGHTERS.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.407
HE DOESN'T DESERVE
A FAMILY.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.350
THEY'RE OUT THERE,
AREN'T THEY?

36:31.923 --> 36:33.659
I KNOW ANNE'S HERE.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.896
- SHE'S RIGHT OUTSIDE,
SEAN.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.901
SO TALK TO HER.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.405
- HE DOESN'T DESERVE YOU,
ANNE.

36:56.982 --> 37:02.288
I WILL NEVER FORGET SEEING YOU
AT THAT PARTY,

37:02.321 --> 37:05.324
PREGNANT, GLOWING.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.926
YOU SMILED RIGHT AT ME.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.662
YOU SAID,
"WE'RE SO BLESSED.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.897
THIS IS OUR MIRACLE BABY."

37:11.930 --> 37:12.898
[bangs metal]

37:12.931 --> 37:14.333
[exhales]

37:14.366 --> 37:16.668
WELL, NO MIRACLES FOR ME.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.970
I NEVER FOUND
THE RIGHT ONE.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.476
UNTIL NOW.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.679
TILL TAYLOR.

37:29.448 --> 37:32.818
- TELL HER
WHERE HER DAUGHTER IS.

37:32.851 --> 37:37.055
- I'LL TELL YOU, ANNE.
ONLY YOU.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.358
BUT I NEED TO SEE YOU
FIRST.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.934
- HERE WE GO.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.403
- WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER?

37:51.437 --> 37:52.270
PLEASE.

37:52.304 --> 37:54.906
- CAN'T WE JUST TALK
LIKE WE USED TO?

37:54.940 --> 37:59.445
- I'VE HURT YOU, SEAN.
I KNOW THAT.

37:59.478 --> 38:03.449
AND I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I'M SORRY.

38:03.482 --> 38:08.754
- I'M GONNA ASK YOU
FOR ONE SIMPLE FAVOR.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.856
- AND IF I GIVE IT
TO YOU,

38:10.889 --> 38:12.424
WILL YOU TELL ME
WHERE TAYLOR IS?

38:23.435 --> 38:25.504
- ONE DANCE.

38:27.506 --> 38:31.443
WE NEVER GOT TO DANCE.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.779
YOU ALWAYS SAID,
"NEXT TIME."

38:33.812 --> 38:35.514
"NEXT TIME."

38:38.884 --> 38:41.387
HOW ABOUT NOW?

38:44.390 --> 38:47.726
- WHATEVER YOU WANT,
SEAN.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.462
- AND I WANT HIM TO WATCH.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.933
YOUR HUSBAND, THE DOCTOR.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.969
I WANT HIM TO FEEL
WHAT IT'S LIKE

38:58.003 --> 39:00.105
TO SEE YOU
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

39:02.774 --> 39:05.744
[My One And Only playing]

39:05.777 --> 39:10.482
- * THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU
MAKES MY HEART SING *

39:10.516 --> 39:13.419
* LIKE AN APRIL BREEZE

39:13.452 --> 39:18.790
* ON THE WINGS OF SPRING

39:18.824 --> 39:25.531
- * AND YOU APPEAR
IN ALL YOUR SPLENDOR *

39:26.498 --> 39:31.603
* MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE

39:37.543 --> 39:44.816
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS DREAMED
ABOUT...

39:44.850 --> 39:49.821
GIVING AWAY MY DAUGHTER
AT HER WEDDING.

39:51.122 --> 39:54.092
- THAT'S VERY SWEET.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.061
MAYBE IT WILL STILL
HAPPEN.

39:57.563 --> 39:58.964
- NO.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.971
OUR DAUGHTER.

40:09.608 --> 40:14.212
BUT COLIN GETS TO DO THAT
INSTEAD OF ME.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.614
WITH TAYLOR.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.589
[sighs]

40:23.622 --> 40:28.894
OF COURSE, THERE'S STILL
ONE LITTLE PROBLEM.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.064
- WHAT'S THAT?

40:36.067 --> 40:38.504
- [whispers indistinct]

40:38.537 --> 40:42.240
- NO! NO! NO!

40:42.273 --> 40:45.977
NO, NO, NO! NO!

40:46.011 --> 40:47.846
- ANNE! ANNE!

40:47.879 --> 40:48.847
- NO!

40:48.880 --> 40:50.482
- I NEED TO GET IN THERE.
MY WIFE NEEDS ME.

40:50.516 --> 40:51.883
- TAKE IT EASY.
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.152
- PLEASE, LET ME JUST GO IN.
- TAKE IT EASY, OKAY?

40:54.185 --> 40:56.655
- HE KILLED HER.
HE KILLED HER.

40:56.688 --> 41:00.992
HE KILLED HER.
HE KILLED HER. HE KILLED HER.

41:02.661 --> 41:08.166
- DARLING.
- [crying]

41:08.199 --> 41:10.035
- I JUST DON'T GET IT.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.637
I MEAN, WHY KILL THE GIRL?

41:11.670 --> 41:12.871
IT'S NOT PART OF HIS M.O.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.006
- IN HIS MIND,
HE WANTED ANNE TO HURT

41:15.040 --> 41:16.007
THE SAME WAY HE DID.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.876
- AND HE'S STILL
TORTURING THEM.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.611
HE WON'T TELL US
WHERE TAYLOR'S BODY IS.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.146
- WELL, WE'VE CANVASSED

41:21.179 --> 41:22.881
ALL THE HOTELS AND CAFES
WE KNOW HE HIT.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.182
NOTHING YET.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.885
- NO, HE SAID
THAT TAYLOR'S SPECIAL.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.621
HIS USUAL HOTELS
WERE KIND OF MODEST.

41:29.655 --> 41:30.989
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
IN THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD.

41:31.022 --> 41:32.924
WE'VE GOT TO TRY
THE EAST SIDE.

41:36.061 --> 41:38.564
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
ANYBODY SAW THE GIRL?

41:38.597 --> 41:40.298
- SHE ORDERED ROOM SERVICE
LAST NIGHT.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.600
WHY?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

41:41.633 --> 41:43.635
- HEY, LOOK,
JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.906
- SEAN?

41:47.939 --> 41:49.575
- TAYLOR.

41:49.608 --> 41:51.543
- WE'VE GOT THE GIRL.
SHE'S ALIVE.

41:51.577 --> 41:54.212
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE'S SEAN?

41:58.717 --> 42:02.253
- TAYLOR, SEAN TOLD
YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER

42:02.287 --> 42:04.690
THAT YOU WERE DEAD.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.560
- YOU'RE LYING.
HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

42:08.594 --> 42:10.929
- HONEY, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO HE IS.

42:10.962 --> 42:12.330
- YES, I DO.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.066
THERE'S A REASON I NEVER FELT
CLOSE TO MY DAD.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.702
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S NOT
MY REAL FATHER.

42:16.735 --> 42:17.969
SEAN IS.

42:18.003 --> 42:19.204
LAST NIGHT, HE FINALLY
TOLD ME THE TRUTH.

42:19.237 --> 42:22.073
- TAYLOR, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- YES, IT IS!

42:22.107 --> 42:23.642
- PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON.
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

42:23.675 --> 42:25.076
I WANT SEAN!

42:28.313 --> 42:31.049
I WANT MY FATHER!
