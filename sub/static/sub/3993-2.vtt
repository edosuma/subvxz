WOMAN: The great artisans say
the more the teapot is used

00:17.720 --> 00:20.360
the more beautiful it becomes.

00:22.040 --> 00:28.320
The pot is seasoned by repeatedly
pouring tea over the surface.

00:28.320 --> 00:35.640
The deposit left on the clay creates
this beautiful patina over time.

Well, I can't see how a tiny splash
of tea is going to help.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.000
Sometimes
you have to look hard at something

01:20.000 --> 01:21.520

01:32.160 --> 01:35.080
I don't suppose
that you want to have a drink?

01:35.080 --> 01:40.400
Not tea, obviously.
Um, in a pub, with me, tonight.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.480
Um...?

01:42.480 --> 01:44.640
You wouldn't like me all that much.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.040

I can't.

What? Why not?

04:58.240 --> 05:01.880
Because I had a row in the shop

You...
You had a row with a machine?!

05:04.160 --> 05:07.240

Right. You're doing that thing.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.600
We were at uni together, and this guy
here had a trick he used to do.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.120
It's not a trick.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.160
He could look at you
and tell you your whole life story.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.600
Yes, I've seen him do it. Put the
wind up everybody, we hated him.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.720
We'd come down to breakfast
in the formal hall

08:16.720 --> 08:18.760
and this freak would know you'd been
shagging the previous night.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.120
I simply observed.
Go on, enlighten me.

08:21.120 --> 08:24.920
Two trips a month,
flying all the way around the world,
you're quite right.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.440
How could you tell? Are you going
to tell me there's a stain on my tie

08:28.440 --> 08:30.920
from some special kind of ketchup
you can only buy in Manhattan?

08:30.920 --> 08:33.400
No, I...
Is it the mud on my shoes?

08:34.919 --> 08:37.400
I was just chatting with
your secretary outside.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.960
She told me.

Sir William's office -
the bank's former chairman.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.840
The room's been left here
like a sort of memorial.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.920
Someone broke in late last night.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.480
What did they steal?
Nothing.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.960
Just left a little message.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.640
How many ways into that office?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.800
Well, that's where this gets
really interesting.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.640
Every door that opens in this bank,
it gets locked right here.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.600
Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.080
That door didn't open last night?

09:44.080 --> 09:46.080
There's a hole in our security.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.720
Find it and we'll pay you -

09:47.720 --> 09:49.320
five figures.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.080
This is an advance.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.720
Tell me how he got in.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.240
There's a bigger one on its way.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.440
I don't need an incentive,
Sebastian.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.000

CLEARS THROAT
..he's kidding you, obviously.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.760

10:04.760 --> 10:06.240
Thanks.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.440
Two trips around the world
this month.

11:57.440 --> 12:01.560
You didn't ask his secretary,
you said that just to irritate him.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.400
How did you know?
Did you see his watch?

12:03.400 --> 12:05.160
His watch?

12:05.160 --> 12:06.880
The time was right,
but the date was wrong.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.240
Said two days ago. Crossed the date
line twice and he didn't alter it.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.480
Within a month?
How did you get that? New Breitling.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.920
Only came out this February.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.640
OK. So do you think we should
sniff around here for a bit longer?

12:18.640 --> 12:20.640
Got everything I need
to know already, thanks.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.880
That graffiti was a message.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.160
Someone at the bank,
working on the trading floors.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.800
We find the intended recipient
and...

12:27.800 --> 12:29.800
They'll lead us to the person
who sent it?

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
Obvious.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.920
Well, there's 300 people up there,
who was it meant for?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.440
Pillars. What?

12:35.440 --> 12:36.520
Pillars and the screens.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.320
Very few places
you could see that graffiti from.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.760
That narrows the field considerably.
And, of course, the message was left

12:41.760 --> 12:44.040
at 11.34 last night.
That tells us a lot.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.880
Does it?
Traders come to work at all hours.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.640
Some trade with Hong Kong
in the middle of the night.

12:47.640 --> 12:52.000
That message was intended for
somebody who came in at midnight.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.760
Not many Van Coons

Just moved in. What?

13:34.680 --> 13:37.280
No, well, er, I've just moved in.

13:38.520 --> 13:42.440
Actually, I've just locked
my keys in my flat.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.840
Do you want me to buzz you in?

13:43.840 --> 13:46.360

14:37.520 --> 14:39.960
Yeah, any time
you feel like letting me in(!)

14:54.240 --> 14:56.400
Do you think he'd lost a lot of
money?

14:56.400 --> 14:58.600
Suicide is pretty common
among City boys.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.640
We don't know that it was suicide.
Come on.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.760
The door was locked from the inside,
you had to climb down the balcony.

15:03.760 --> 15:07.880
Been away three days
judging by the laundry.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.200
Look at the case, there was
something tightly packed inside it.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.040
Thanks. I'll take your word for it.
Problem?

15:15.040 --> 15:18.680
Yeah, I'm not desperate to root
around some bloke's dirty underwear.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.240
Those symbols at the bank, the
graffiti, why were they put there?

15:22.240 --> 15:24.320
Some sort of code? Obviously.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.720
Why were they painted? Want to
communicate, why not use e-mail?

15:26.720 --> 15:28.320
Well, maybe he wasn't answering.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.840
Oh, good, you follow.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.680
No.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.280
What kind of a message
would everyone try to avoid?

15:35.840 --> 15:37.320
What about this morning?

15:37.320 --> 15:40.800
Those letters you were looking at?
Bills?

15:42.760 --> 15:45.880
Yes. He was being threatened.

off this glass.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.280
Sergeant, we haven't met.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.600
Yeah, I know who you are

15:54.600 --> 15:57.000
and I would prefer it if you didn't
tamper with any of the evidence.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.760
I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?
He's busy. I'm in charge.

16:05.760 --> 16:09.600
And it's not Sergeant,
it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.240
We're obviously
looking at a suicide.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.840
It does seem the only explanation
of all the facts.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.360
Wrong, it's one possible explanation
of some of the facts.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.760
You've got a solution that you like,
but you are choosing

16:22.760 --> 16:24.800
to ignore anything you see
that doesn't comply with it.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.720
Like? Wound's on the right side of
his head.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.000
And? Van Coon was left-handed.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.440
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

16:30.440 --> 16:34.080
Left-handed? I'm amazed you
didn't notice. All you have to do
is look around this flat.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.000
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

16:36.000 --> 16:37.640
coffee mug handle
pointing to the left.

16:37.640 --> 16:40.080
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left. Pen and paper

16:40.080 --> 16:43.400
on the left of the phone.
Picked up with his right,
took messages with his left.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.200
D'you want me to go on?
No, I think you've covered it.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.960
I might as well, I'm almost
at the bottom of the list.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.680
There's a knife on the breadboard
with butter on the right side
of the blade

16:49.680 --> 16:51.400
because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely

16:51.400 --> 16:53.640
that a left-handed man would shoot
himself in the right of his head.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.800
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him -

16:55.800 --> 16:57.720
only explanation
of all of the facts.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.800
But the gun?
He was waiting for the killer.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.640
He'd been threatened. What?

17:02.640 --> 17:05.520
Today at the bank, sort of a warning.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.560
He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.079
And the bullet?
Went through the open window.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.000
Oh, come on(!)

17:12.000 --> 17:13.760
What are the chances of that?!

17:13.760 --> 17:16.000
Wait until you get the ballistics
report.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.800
The bullet in his brain wasn't
fired from his gun, I guarantee it.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.040
If his door was locked from the
inside, how did the killer get in?

17:23.040 --> 17:25.920
Good, you're finally asking
the right questions.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.240
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork,

17:35.240 --> 17:37.040
which of course can never be done.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.920
It was a threat,
that's what the graffiti meant.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.080
I'm kind of in a meeting.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.440
Can you make an appointment
with my secretary?

17:43.440 --> 17:46.680
I don't think this can wait.
Sorry, Sebastian.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.680
One of your traders, someone who
worked in your office, was killed.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.480
What? Van Coon.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.560
The police are at his flat.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.440
Killed?!
Sorry to interfere

17:55.440 --> 17:58.640
with everyone's digestion.
Still want to make an appointment(?)

17:58.640 --> 18:00.920
Would maybe nine o'clock
at Scotland Yard suit?

18:05.120 --> 18:08.800
Harrow, Oxford...very bright guy.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.840
Worked in Asia for a while, so...

18:12.840 --> 18:14.520
You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?

18:16.520 --> 18:20.760
Lost 5 million in a single morning,
made it all back a week later.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.360
Nerves of steel, Eddie had.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.760
Who'd want to kill him?
We all make enemies.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.520
You don't all end up with a bullet
through your temple.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.960
MOBILE RINGS
Not usually. Excuse me.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.200
It's my chairman.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.080
Police have been on to him.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.000
Apparently they're telling him

18:38.000 --> 18:39.880
it was a suicide.
Well, they've got it wrong,

18:39.880 --> 18:41.080
Sebastian. He was murdered.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.960
Well, I'm afraid
they don't see it like that.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.200
So? And neither does my boss.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.400
I hired you to do a job.
Don't get sidetracked.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.880
FADING FOOTSTEPS

18:52.880 --> 18:55.320
I thought bankers were all supposed
to be heartless bastards.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.600
HORN BLARES

19:43.440 --> 19:46.320
I need you to get over to Crispians.

19:46.320 --> 19:50.440
Two Ming vases up for auction -
Chenghua.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.640
Will you appraise them? Soo Lin
should go - she's the expert.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.240
Soo Lin has resigned her job.
I need you.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.040
PHONE RINGING

20:50.880 --> 20:53.640
Just locum work.
No, that's fine.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.840
You're, um...
Well, you're a bit over-qualified.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.920
Er, I could always do
with the money.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.440
Well, we've got two
away on holiday this week

21:05.440 --> 21:07.920
and one's just left to have a baby.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.680
It might be a bit mundane for you.

21:10.680 --> 21:14.480
Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.080
Mundane works.

21:16.080 --> 21:20.280
It says here you were a soldier.
And a doctor.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.680
Anything else you can do?

21:24.680 --> 21:26.720
I learned the clarinet at school.

21:26.720 --> 21:31.360
Oh...
LAUGHS
..well, I'll look forward to it.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.120
I said, could you pass me a pen?

21:42.680 --> 21:44.520
What? When?
About an hour ago.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.440
Didn't notice I'd gone out then?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.480
I went to see about a job
at that surgery.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.400
How was it?
Great. She's great.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.360
Who?

21:57.360 --> 21:58.640
The job.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.720
She?!

22:00.880 --> 22:01.840
It.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.160
Yeah, have a look.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.400
"The intruder
who can walk through walls."

22:13.400 --> 22:14.520
It happened last night.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.800
Journalist shot dead in his flat.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.680
Doors locked,
windows bolted from the inside.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.440
Exactly the same as Van Coon.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.480
God! You think...?
He's killed another one.

22:32.840 --> 22:36.520
Brian Lukis,
freelance journalist,

22:36.520 --> 22:38.880
murdered in his flat.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.920
Doors locked from the inside.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.080
You've got to admit,
it's similar.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.400
Both men killed by someone
who can walk through solid walls.

22:46.400 --> 22:50.120
Inspector, do you seriously believe
that Eddie Van Coon was

22:50.120 --> 22:51.520
just another city suicide?

22:53.360 --> 22:56.800
SIGHS
You have seen
the ballistics report, I suppose?

22:56.800 --> 22:59.160
And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun?

22:59.160 --> 23:01.560
No. No.
So this investigation might move

23:01.560 --> 23:04.200
a bit quicker if you were
to take my word as gospel.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.840
I've just handed you
a murder inquiry.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.040
Five minutes in his flat.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.200
Four floors up.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.960
That's why they think they're safe.

23:44.960 --> 23:48.080
Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're
impregnable.

23:50.240 --> 23:54.040
They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

23:54.040 --> 23:58.960
I don't understand. Dealing
with a killer who can climb.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.200
What are you doing?
Clings to the walls like an insect.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.280
CLUNK!
That's how he got in.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.280
What?!

24:05.280 --> 24:08.360
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof,

24:08.360 --> 24:10.320
dropped in through this skylight.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.400
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

24:12.400 --> 24:15.720
He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building,

24:15.720 --> 24:19.240
jumped the balcony and killed
Van Coon. Oh, hold on(!)

24:19.240 --> 24:23.720
That's how he got into the bank -
ran along the window ledge
onto the terrace.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.200
I have to find out
what connects these two men.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.280
Date stamped on the book
is the same day that he died.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.680
Sherlock?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.520
So, the killer goes to the bank,

25:21.520 --> 25:22.640
leaves a threatening cipher
at the bank.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.400
Van Coon panics, returns
to his apartment, locks himself in.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.440
Hours later, he dies.

25:27.440 --> 25:32.320
The killer finds Lukis at the
library, he writes the cipher

25:32.320 --> 25:34.920
on the shelf where he knows
it'll be seen. Lukis goes home.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.120
Late that night, he dies too.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.920
Why did they die, Sherlock?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.920
Only the cipher can tell us.

25:50.160 --> 25:53.160
The world's run on
codes and ciphers, John.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.800
From the million-pound
security system at the bank
to the PIN machine

25:55.800 --> 25:59.000
you took exception to. Cryptography
inhabits our every waking moment.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.560
Yes, OK, but...

26:00.560 --> 26:02.320
But it's all computer generated -

26:02.320 --> 26:04.840
electronic codes,
electronic ciphering methods.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.640
This is different.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.760
It's an ancient device.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.120
Modern code-breaking methods
won't unravel it.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.000
Where are we headed?
I need to ask some advice.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.400
What?! Sorry?

26:16.680 --> 26:18.920
You heard me perfectly.
I'm not saying it again.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.640
You need advice?
On painting.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.360
Yes, I need to talk to an expert.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.280
SIREN WAILS

26:31.000 --> 26:33.120
Part of a new exhibition.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.960
Interesting.
I call it...

26:35.960 --> 26:39.400
Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.
CHUCKLES

26:39.400 --> 26:41.280
Catchy(!)

26:41.280 --> 26:44.080
I've got two minutes before
a Community Support Officer

26:44.080 --> 26:45.360
comes around that corner.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.920
Can we do this while I'm working?

26:53.280 --> 26:57.240
Know the author?
I recognise the paint.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.960
It's like Michigan...hard-core
propellant.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.160
I'd say zinc.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.680
And what about the symbols?
Do you recognise them?

27:03.680 --> 27:05.840
I'm not even sure
it's a proper language.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.120
Two men have been murdered, Raz.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.240
Deciphering this is the key
to finding out who killed them.

27:11.240 --> 27:14.160
And this is all you've
got to go on(?)

27:14.160 --> 27:16.960
It's hardly much, is it?
Are you going to help us or not?

27:18.480 --> 27:19.600
I'll ask around.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.080
Somebody must know something
about it. Oi!

27:24.200 --> 27:25.280
METALLIC CLATTERING

27:25.280 --> 27:28.160
What the hell do you think you're
doing? This gallery is a listed
public building.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.520
No, no. Wait, wait.
It's not me who painted that.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.000
I was just holding this for...

27:37.600 --> 27:39.280
Bit of an enthusiast, are we?

27:39.280 --> 27:41.920
POLICE RADIO IN BACKGROUND

27:43.000 --> 27:46.560
She was right in the middle of
an important piece of restoration.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.480
Why would she suddenly resign?

27:48.480 --> 27:50.560
Family problems.
She said so in her letter.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.560
But she doesn't have a family.
She came to this country on her own.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.000
Andy! Look, those teapots,
those ceramics.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.800
They've become her obsession.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.280
She's been working on restoring them
for weeks.

28:00.280 --> 28:03.760
I can't believe
that she would just...abandon them.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.000
Perhaps she was getting
a bit of unwanted attention?

28:16.520 --> 28:17.640
DOOR SLAMS

28:19.240 --> 28:20.360
You've been a while.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.800
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.840
Custody sergeants don't really
like to be hurried, do they?

28:27.840 --> 28:30.360
Just formalities. Fingerprints,

28:30.360 --> 28:32.960
charge sheet, and I've got to be
in magistrates' court on Tuesday.

28:32.960 --> 28:37.040
What? Me, Sherlock!
In court, on Tuesday!

28:37.040 --> 28:39.680
They're giving me an ASBO!
Good, fine.

28:39.680 --> 28:43.040
You want to tell your little pal
he's welcome to go and own up
any time.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.280
This symbol, I still can't place it.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.920
No, I need you to go
to the police station

28:46.920 --> 28:50.120
and ask about the journalist.
The personal effects
will have been impounded.

28:50.120 --> 28:53.440
Get hold of his diary, or something
that will tell us his movements.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.160
Go and see Van Coon's PA.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.720
If you retrace their steps,
somewhere they'll coincide.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.080
SHUTTER CLICKS

29:07.160 --> 29:09.280
Scotland Yard.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.280
Flew back from Dalian Friday.

29:21.280 --> 29:24.120
Looks like he had back-to-back
meetings with the sales team.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.600
Can you print me up a copy?

29:25.600 --> 29:27.640
Sure.
What about the day he died?

29:27.640 --> 29:30.680
Can you tell me where he was?
Sorry, I've got a gap.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.520
I have all his receipts.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.520
Your friend...
Listen, whatever you say,

29:36.520 --> 29:38.120
I'm behind you 100 per cent.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.600
...he's an arrogant sod.

29:40.640 --> 29:44.000
Well, that was mild.
People say a lot worse than that.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.520
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
The journalist's diary?

29:54.360 --> 29:57.480
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda?
Appreciative?

29:57.480 --> 30:01.040
Um, no. That's not a word I'd use.

30:01.040 --> 30:04.800
The only things Eddie appreciated
had a big price tag.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.520
Like that hand cream.
He bought that for you, didn't he?

30:13.400 --> 30:15.600
Look at this one.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.000
Got a taxi from him
on the day he died, £18.50.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.840
That would get him to the office.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.560
Not rush hour. Check the time.
Mid-morning. 18 would get him

30:22.560 --> 30:25.920
as far as... ..The West End.
I remember him saying.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.040
Underground,
printed at one in Piccadilly.

30:29.040 --> 30:32.000
So he got a Tube back to the office.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.400
Why would he get a taxi into town,
and then the Tube back?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.640
Because he was delivering
something heavy.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.520
You wouldn't lug a package
up the escalator.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.440
Delivering?!

30:40.440 --> 30:42.440
To somewhere near
Piccadilly Station.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.760
Dropped the package,
delivered it, and then...

30:47.600 --> 30:50.000
Stopped on his way. He got peckish.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.600
So you bought your lunch
from here en route to the station

30:56.600 --> 30:58.240
but where were you headed from?

30:58.240 --> 31:00.160
Where did the taxi drop you?

31:00.160 --> 31:01.880
Oof! Right.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.840
Eddie Van Coon brought a package
here the day he died.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.320
Whatever was hidden inside
that case...

31:05.320 --> 31:07.280
I've managed to piece
together a picture

31:07.280 --> 31:10.800
using scraps of information -
credit card bills, receipts.
He flew back from China,

31:10.800 --> 31:12.320
then he came here. Sherlock.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.680
Somewhere in this street, somewhere
near. I don't know where, but...

31:14.680 --> 31:18.800
That shop, over there.
How could you tell?

31:18.800 --> 31:20.160
Lukis' diary. He was here too.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.360
He wrote down the address. Oh.

31:41.880 --> 31:44.320
SHOP BELL RINGS

31:47.840 --> 31:49.360
Hello.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.800
You want...lucky cat?

31:57.800 --> 32:00.440
No, thanks, no.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.200
£10! £10!

32:04.560 --> 32:07.480
I think your wife, she will like.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.480
Um, thank you.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.640
Sherlock...

32:20.880 --> 32:23.800
The label there.
Yes, I see it.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.400
It's exactly the same as the cipher.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.240
WATSON CLEARS THROAT

32:31.280 --> 32:35.120
It's an ancient number system -
Hang Zhou.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.480
These days only street traders
use it.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.640
Those were numbers written on the
wall at the bank and at the library.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.720
Numbers written in
an ancient Chinese dialect.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.400
It's a 15.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.520
What we thought was the
artist's tag, it's a number 15.

32:47.520 --> 32:51.480
And the blindfold, the horizontal
line. That was a number as well.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.880
The Chinese number one, John.
We found it.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.800
Two men travel back from China,

33:02.800 --> 33:07.440
both head straight for
the Lucky Cat emporium.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.640
What did they see?

33:09.640 --> 33:11.720
It's not what they saw.

33:11.720 --> 33:15.080
It's what they both brought back
in those suitcases.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.240
And you don't mean duty free.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.600
Thank you.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.000
Think about what Sebastian told us.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.720
About Van Coon, about
how he stayed afloat in the market.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.640
Lost 5 million.
Made it back in a week.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.480
That's how he made such easy money.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.240
He was a smuggler. Mm.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.040
Cover would have been perfect.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.360
Businessman,
making frequent trips to Asia.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.560
Lukis was the same,
a journalist writing about China.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.000
Both of them smuggled stuff about.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.280
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.440
But why did they die?

33:52.440 --> 33:56.120
It doesn't make sense.
If they both turn up at the shop
and deliver the goods,

33:56.120 --> 33:57.800
why would someone threaten them

33:57.800 --> 34:01.040
and kill them after the event,
after they'd finished the job?

34:05.360 --> 34:07.160
What if one of them
was light-fingered?

34:07.160 --> 34:09.120
How do you mean? Stole something.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.639
Something from the hoard.

34:10.639 --> 34:12.639
The killer doesn't know
which of them took it

34:12.639 --> 34:14.120
so threatens them both. Right.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.719
Remind me.

34:18.719 --> 34:21.320
When was the last time
that it rained?

34:30.320 --> 34:32.159
It's been here since Monday.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.760
HE RINGS DOORBELL

34:43.639 --> 34:46.920
No-one's been in that flat
for at least three days.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.960
Could have gone on holiday.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.760
Do you leave your windows open
when you go on holiday?

35:10.080 --> 35:12.840
Someone else has been here.

35:12.840 --> 35:17.480
Somebody else broke into the flat
and knocked over the vase,
just like I did.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.520

you could let me in this time?

Can you not keep doing this, please?

35:44.160 --> 35:45.880
I'm not the first.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.920
What?
Somebody's been in here before me.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.520
What are you saying?

35:56.040 --> 35:59.040
Size eight feet.

35:59.040 --> 36:03.800
Small, but...athletic.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.600

36:17.960 --> 36:20.360
Why didn't he close the window
when he lef...?

36:20.360 --> 36:23.280
Oh, stupid, stupid!

36:23.280 --> 36:25.280
Obvious.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.880
He's still here.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.440
John!

36:58.160 --> 37:00.160
Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone

37:00.160 --> 37:03.160
because no-one else can compete
with my massive intellect(!)

Somebody left here in a hurry
three days ago. Somebody?

37:51.760 --> 37:54.480
Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.200
How, exactly?

38:00.760 --> 38:02.080
We could start with this.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.080
You've gone all croaky.
Are you getting a cold?

38:05.080 --> 38:06.720

I'm fine.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.440
When was the last time
that you saw her?

38:10.440 --> 38:12.960
ANDY: Three days ago.
Here at the museum.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.920
This morning they told me
she'd resigned.

38:16.920 --> 38:20.480
Just like that.
Left her work unfinished.

38:20.480 --> 38:24.360
What was the last thing that she did
on her final afternoon?

38:28.000 --> 38:33.680
She does this demonstration
for the tourists, a tea ceremony.

38:33.680 --> 38:38.280
So she would have packed up her
things and just put them in here.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.480
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.800
If she's still alive.
Sherlock!

39:00.800 --> 39:03.440
Oh, look who it is.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.880
Found something you'll like.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.240
Tuesday morning,

39:13.240 --> 39:15.360
all you've got to do is turn up
and say the bag was yours.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.960
Forget about your court date.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.480
GIRL: Dude, that was rad!

39:26.360 --> 39:28.960
You want to hide a tree, then a
forest is the best place to do it,

39:28.960 --> 39:30.640
wouldn't you say?

39:30.640 --> 39:33.320
People would just walk
straight past, not knowing,

39:33.320 --> 39:35.120
unable to decipher the message.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.400
There. I spotted it earlier.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.280
They've been here.
And that's the exact same paint?

39:43.280 --> 39:44.280
Yeah.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.520
John, if we're going to
decipher this code,

39:46.520 --> 39:48.200
we need to look for more evidence.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.080
Answer your phone.
I've been calling you.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.840
PANTING
I found it.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.600
It's been painted over.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.320
I don't understand. It was...

41:16.320 --> 41:17.440
here.

41:19.120 --> 41:21.000
10 minutes ago. I saw it.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.760
A whole load of graffiti.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.840
Somebody doesn't want me to see it.

41:26.240 --> 41:29.120
Sherlock, what are you doing...?
Ssh! John, concentrate.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.960
I need you to concentrate.
Close your eyes.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.480
What? Why? Why? What are you doing?

41:33.480 --> 41:36.160
I need you to maximise
your visual memory.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.120
Try to picture what you saw.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.240
Can you picture it? Yeah.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.000
Can you remember it?
Yes, definitely.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.080
Can you remember the pattern?

41:43.080 --> 41:44.800
Yes. How much can you remember it?

41:44.800 --> 41:45.960
Look, don't worry.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.400
Because the average human memory
on visual matters
is only 62% accurate.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.680
Well, don't worry,
I remember all of it. Really?

41:51.680 --> 41:56.120
At least I would, if I could get
to my pockets. I took a photograph.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.920
MOBILE BEEPS

42:01.840 --> 42:06.320

42:20.800 --> 42:21.840

42:21.840 --> 42:23.720
come with partners.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.120
God, I need to sleep.

42:25.120 --> 42:28.240
Why did he paint it
so near the tracks? No idea.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.320
Thousands of people
pass by there every day.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
Just 20 minutes...

42:33.480 --> 42:35.320
Of course.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.640
Of course, he wants information.
He's trying to communicate

42:37.640 --> 42:41.880
with his people in the underworld.
Whatever was stolen,
he wants it back.

42:41.880 --> 42:45.520
It's somewhere here, in a code.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.800
We can't crack this
without Soo Lin Yao.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.760
Oh, good.

42:50.760 --> 42:53.520
Two men who travelled back
from China were murdered.

42:53.520 --> 42:56.640
And their killer left them messages
in Hang Zhou numerals.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.640
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.520
That cipher, it was just
the same pattern as the others.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.280
He means to kill her as well.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.200
Look, I've tried everywhere -

43:05.200 --> 43:07.800
friends, colleagues.
I don't know where she's gone.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.120
I mean, she could be
a thousand miles away.

43:11.760 --> 43:15.280
What are you looking at?
Tell me more about those teapots.

43:15.280 --> 43:19.800
The pots were her obsession.
They need urgent work.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.160
If they dry out,
then the clay can start to crumble.

43:22.160 --> 43:25.280
Apparently, you have to just
keep making tea in them.

43:25.280 --> 43:29.120
Yesterday, only one of those pots
was shining.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.840
Now, there are two.

43:40.560 --> 43:41.560
GRATING

44:21.000 --> 44:23.960
Fancy a biscuit with that?

44:25.800 --> 44:28.960
Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.480
Hello.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.280
You saw the cipher.

44:39.280 --> 44:42.880
Then you know he is coming for me.

44:42.880 --> 44:46.440
You've been clever
to avoid him so far.

44:46.440 --> 44:48.680
I had to finish.

44:48.680 --> 44:50.560
To finish this work.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.640
It's only a matter of time.

44:54.640 --> 44:57.200
I know he will find me.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.120
Who is he?
Have you met him before?

45:01.640 --> 45:05.200
When I was a girl, we met in China.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.640
I recognised his...

45:09.640 --> 45:12.000
signature.
The cipher?

45:13.920 --> 45:18.200
Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu.

45:18.200 --> 45:21.760
Zhi Zhu? The spider.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.360
You know this mark?

45:28.360 --> 45:31.480
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

45:31.480 --> 45:36.080
Huh? Ancient crime syndicate,
based in China.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.080
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

45:42.560 --> 45:44.400
Everyone who hauls for them.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.320
Hauls?

45:49.280 --> 45:50.840
You mean you were a smuggler?

45:54.920 --> 45:56.840
I was 15.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.440
My parents were dead.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.480
I had no livelihood.

46:04.280 --> 46:08.200
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

46:08.200 --> 46:10.200
except to work for the bosses.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.000
Who are they?

46:12.000 --> 46:16.040
They are called the Black Lotus.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.400
By the time I was 16,

46:22.920 --> 46:26.560
I was taking
thousands of pounds worth of drugs

46:26.560 --> 46:28.480
across the border into Hong Kong.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.360
I managed to leave
that life behind me.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.160
I came to England.

46:40.800 --> 46:43.080
They gave me a job, here.

46:45.960 --> 46:49.920
Everything was good. New life.

46:49.920 --> 46:52.720
And he came looking for you.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.200
Yes.

46:56.680 --> 47:00.440
I hoped, after five years...

47:00.440 --> 47:02.560
maybe they would have forgotten me.

47:03.840 --> 47:06.440
But they never really let you leave.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.040
A small community like ours...

47:12.560 --> 47:14.560
..they are never very far away.

47:20.760 --> 47:22.640
He came to my flat.

47:22.640 --> 47:27.280
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

47:27.280 --> 47:29.200
And you've no idea what it was?

47:29.200 --> 47:31.480
I refused to help.

47:31.480 --> 47:35.800
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

47:37.720 --> 47:39.560
Oh, yes.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.200
He's my brother.

47:56.640 --> 47:59.360
Two orphans.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.240
We had no choice.

48:05.240 --> 48:10.600
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like
beggars.

48:15.080 --> 48:17.720
My brother has become their puppet.

48:18.960 --> 48:23.400
In the power of the one
they call Shan.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.160
The Black Lotus general.

48:28.520 --> 48:30.800
I turned my brother away.

48:33.080 --> 48:35.520
He said I had betrayed him.

48:38.080 --> 48:40.480
Next day, I came to work

48:40.480 --> 48:42.880
and the cipher was waiting.

48:49.240 --> 48:51.080
Can you decipher these?

48:52.840 --> 48:55.520
These are numbers. Yes, I know.

48:55.520 --> 49:00.840
Here, the line across the man's
eyes, it's the Chinese number one.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.600
And this one is 15.
But what's the code?

49:04.720 --> 49:07.160
All the smugglers know it.

49:07.160 --> 49:08.840
It's based upon a book...

51:40.240 --> 51:42.280
GUNSHOT

51:43.520 --> 51:45.040
Oh, my God.

52:08.640 --> 52:10.520
GULPS

52:17.480 --> 52:19.120
How many murders is it going to take

52:19.120 --> 52:21.840
before you start believing
that this maniac's out there?

52:21.840 --> 52:23.560
MUTTERS

52:23.560 --> 52:25.960
A young girl was gunned down
tonight.

52:25.960 --> 52:29.800
That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.160
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon

52:31.160 --> 52:33.520
were working for a gang
of international smugglers.

52:33.520 --> 52:37.080
A gang called the Black Lotus,
operating here in London

52:37.080 --> 52:39.320
right under your nose.

52:39.320 --> 52:40.720
Can you prove that?

52:48.680 --> 52:51.320
What are you thinking?
Pork or pasta? Oh, it's you.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.360
I suppose it's never going
to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?

52:55.360 --> 52:56.920
I'd stick with the pasta.

52:56.920 --> 53:01.200
Don't want to be doing roast pork,
not if you're slicing up cadavers.

53:01.200 --> 53:03.560
What are you having?

53:03.560 --> 53:06.000
I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.880
So you're working here tonight?

53:08.880 --> 53:10.720
Need to examine some bodies. Some?

53:10.720 --> 53:13.520
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.

53:13.520 --> 53:15.080
They're on my list.

53:16.640 --> 53:18.960
Could you wheel them out again
for me?

53:18.960 --> 53:23.200
Well...their paperwork's
already gone through.

53:26.800 --> 53:29.960
You changed your hair. What?

53:29.960 --> 53:32.560
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

53:32.560 --> 53:34.160
Yes, well...

53:34.160 --> 53:35.400
It's good.

53:35.400 --> 53:37.800
It...suits you better this way.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.520
We're just interested in the feet.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.320
The feet? Yes.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.120
Do you mind if we have
a look at them?

54:01.840 --> 54:03.480
Now, Van Coon.

54:09.360 --> 54:12.800
Oh! So...

54:12.800 --> 54:16.120
So either these two men just
happened to visit the same
Chinese tattoo parlour,

54:16.120 --> 54:19.560
or I'm telling the truth.
What do you want?

54:19.560 --> 54:22.080
I want every book from Lukis'
apartment and Van Coon's.

54:22.080 --> 54:24.320
Their books?

54:27.600 --> 54:31.240
Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.720
Her brother was corrupted
by one of its leaders.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.160
Soo Lin said the name.

54:37.160 --> 54:39.920
Yes, Shan. General Shan.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.600
We're still no closer to finding him.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.920
Wrong! We've got almost
all we need to know.

54:43.920 --> 54:47.000
She gave us most of
the missing pieces.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.600
Why did he need to visit his sister?

54:49.600 --> 54:52.160
Why did he need her expertise?
She worked at the museum.

54:52.160 --> 54:54.360
Exactly. An expert in antiquities.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.920
Of course, I see.
Valuable antiquities, John.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.760
Ancient Chinese relics
purchased on the black market.

55:00.760 --> 55:04.000
China's home to a thousand treasures
hidden after Mao's revolution.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.440
The Black Lotus is selling them.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.960
Check for the dates... Here,

55:12.960 --> 55:15.600
John,
"arrived from China four days ago".

55:16.480 --> 55:18.160
Anonymous.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.640
The vendor doesn't give his name.

55:20.640 --> 55:23.120
"Two undiscovered treasures
from the East."

55:23.120 --> 55:27.640
One in Lukis' suitcase
and one in Van Coon's.

55:27.640 --> 55:29.120
"Antiquities...

55:29.120 --> 55:32.920
"sold at auction."

55:32.920 --> 55:35.280
Look, here's another one.

55:35.280 --> 55:37.000
Arrived from China a month ago,

55:37.000 --> 55:40.440
Chinese ceramic statue sold for
£400,000.

55:40.440 --> 55:43.840
Look, a month before that,
Chinese painting, £500,000.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.160
All of them
from an anonymous source.

55:46.160 --> 55:50.120
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them
into Britain.

55:53.480 --> 55:57.560
Every single auction coincides
with Lukis or Van Coon
travelling to China.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.720
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

55:59.720 --> 56:01.280
What if one of them stole something?

56:01.280 --> 56:03.600
That's why Zhi Zhu's come.
KNOCK AT DOOR

56:03.600 --> 56:06.760
Sorry, are we collecting
for charity, Sherlock?

56:06.760 --> 56:07.920
What?

56:07.920 --> 56:10.800
A young man's outside
with crates of books.

56:16.560 --> 56:18.360
So the numbers are references.

56:18.360 --> 56:19.760
To books.

56:19.760 --> 56:23.160
To specific pages
and specific words on those pages.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.440
Right, so...

56:25.440 --> 56:27.560
15 and 1, that means?

56:27.560 --> 56:29.760
Turn to page 15
and it's the first word you read.

56:29.760 --> 56:32.160
OK, so what's the message?
Depends on the book.

56:32.160 --> 56:35.080
That's the cunning of the book code.

56:35.080 --> 56:37.040
It has to be one that they both own.

56:40.720 --> 56:44.840
OK, fine. This shouldn't take
too long, should it(?)

56:57.320 --> 57:01.600
We found these...at the museum.
Is this your writing?

57:01.600 --> 57:05.200
Er, we hoped Soo Lin
could decipher it for us.

57:05.200 --> 57:07.160
Ta.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.720
Anything else I can do?

57:09.720 --> 57:11.880
To assist you, I mean.

57:11.880 --> 57:14.240
Some silence right now
would be marvellous.

57:28.920 --> 57:31.280
Cigarette.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.280
Imagine.

58:04.640 --> 58:06.800
CLOCK TICKS

58:12.280 --> 58:14.720
WATCH BLEEPS

58:14.720 --> 58:16.160
Oh...

58:17.400 --> 58:19.760
CHURCH BELLS RING

58:21.160 --> 58:22.680
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

58:22.680 --> 58:26.480
but we haven't got anything now
until next Thursday.

58:26.480 --> 58:29.320
WOMAN: This is taking ages.

58:29.320 --> 58:30.680
Sorry.

58:30.680 --> 58:34.040
WOMAN: What's the point of booking
an appointment if they
can't stick to it?

58:34.040 --> 58:35.680
Um, what's going on?

58:35.680 --> 58:40.840
That new doctor you hired, he
hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.

58:40.840 --> 58:43.600
Let me go and have a word.

58:43.600 --> 58:46.440
Excuse me. Sorry.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.960
KNOCKS ON DOOR
John?

58:51.480 --> 58:53.240
John?

58:58.680 --> 59:01.400
GENTLE SNORING

59:03.680 --> 59:07.560
Looks like I'm done.
I thought I had some more to see.

59:07.560 --> 59:10.640
Oh, I did one or two of yours.
One or two?

59:10.640 --> 59:13.920
Well, maybe five or six.

59:13.920 --> 59:16.280
I'm sorry,
that's not very professional.

59:16.280 --> 59:18.920
No, not really.

59:18.920 --> 59:21.400
I had...a bit of a late one.

59:22.680 --> 59:25.160
Oh, right.

59:26.280 --> 59:27.600
Anyway, see you.

59:27.600 --> 59:32.480
So...what were you doing
to keep you up so late?

59:32.480 --> 59:35.440
I was attending
a sort of book event.

59:35.440 --> 59:39.600
Oh. Oh, she likes books,
does she, your girlfriend?

59:39.600 --> 59:41.480
No, it wasn't a date.

59:41.480 --> 59:45.480
Good. I mean, I'm...
And I don't have one tonight.

59:48.160 --> 59:50.400
A book that everybody would own.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.280
15, entry 1.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.560
I need to get some air.
We're going out tonight.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.680
Actually, I've got a date. What?

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.840
Where two people who like each other
go out and have fun?

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.480
That's what I was suggesting.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.480
No, it wasn't. At least, I hope not.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.080
Where are you taking her?

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.640
Er, cinema.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.640
Dull, boring, predictable...

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.920
Why don't you try this?

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.800
In London for one night only.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.320
LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.440
Thanks, but I don't come to you
for dating advice.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.640
SARAH: It's years since anyone
took me to the circus.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.880
Right, yes.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.000
A friend recommended it to me
and I phoned up.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.080
Oh! What are they,
a touring company or something?

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.800
I don't know much about it.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.680
I think they're probably from China.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.040
I think so, yes.
There's a coincidence(!)

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.440
That's wonderful,
thank you very much.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.600
Hi, I have two tickets
reserved for tonight.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.800
And what's the name? Holmes.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.560
Actually, I have three in that name.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.080
No, I don't think so,
we only booked two.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.640
Then I phoned back
and got one for myself as well.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.720
I'm Sherlock.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.600
Hi. Hello.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.600
You couldn't let me have
just one night off.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.120
Yellow Dragon Circus,
in London for one day. It fits.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.840
The Tong sent an assassin
to England...

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.120
Dressed as a tightrope walker.
Come on, Sherlock, behave!

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.200
We're looking for a killer who can
climb, who can shin up a rope.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.920
Where else would you find
that level of dexterity?

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.200
Exit visas are scarce in China.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.120
They need a good reason
to get out of that country.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.920
All I need to do
is have a quick look around...

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.720
Fine. You do that,
I'll take Sarah for a pint.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.000
I need your help.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.760
I do have a couple of other things
on my mind this evening.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.000
Like what?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.040
You are kidding?
What's so important?

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.880
Sherlock,
I'm in the middle of a date.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.880
You're going to chase some killer
while I'm trying to...

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.960
What?

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.080
While I'm trying to get off
with Sarah.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.720
Hey... Ready?

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.200
Yeah.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.440
MURMUR OF CONVERSATION

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.640
You said circus.
This is not a circus.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.080
Look at the size of this crowd.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.560
Sherlock, this is...art.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.160
This is not their day job.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.640
Sorry, I forgot, they're not
a circus, they're a gang
of international smugglers.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.720
LOUDER DRUM BEAT

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.760

Classic Chinese escapology act.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.040
Hm?
The crossbow's on a delicate string.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.320
The warrior has to escape his bonds
before it fires.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.640
HE SHOUTS

THEY LAUGH

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.200
She splits the sandbag,
the sand pours out.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.080
Gradually,
the weight lowers into the bowl.

Thank God. My God!

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.120
APPLAUSE RESTARTS

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.800
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.440
From the distant moonlit shores
of the Yangtze River,

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.520
we present, for your pleasure,

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.800
the deadly Chinese bird spider.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.080
APPLAUSE

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.240
Did you see that?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.280
Well, well.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.240

DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.520
Found you.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.760
Come on.
Come on. Let's go!

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.640
I sent a couple of cars.
The old hall is totally deserted.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.000
Look, I saw the mark at the circus.
The tattoo that we saw

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.840
on the two bodies,
the mark of the Tong.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.359
Lukis and Van Coon were part of
a smuggling operation.

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:57.880
One of them stole something
in China. Something valuable.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.040
The circus performers
were gang members

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.200
sent here to get it back.
Get what back?

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.120
We don't know.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.800
You don't know?

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:10.840
Mr Holmes,
I've done everything you asked.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.640
Lestrade, he seems to think
your advice is worth something.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.920
I gave the order for a raid.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.120
Please tell me I'll have something
to show for it.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.960
Other than a massive bill
for overtime.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.240
They'll be back in China by tomorrow.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.920
No, they won't leave
without what they came for.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.840
We need to find a hideout.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.359
A rendezvous.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.640
Somewhere in this message
it must tell us.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.120
Well, I think
perhaps I should leave you to it.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.600
No, you don't have to go. Stay.
Yes, it'd be better if you left now.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.160
He's kidding.
Please stay if you'd like.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.200
Is it just me
or is anyone else starving?

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.640
Oh, God.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.120
So this is what you do.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.960
You and John,
you solve puzzles for a living.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.400
Consulting detective.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.440
Oh.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.040
Oh!

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.360
What are these squiggles?

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.360
They're numbers.
An ancient Chinese dialect.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.680
Oh, right. Well, of course
I should have known that.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.760
(I've done punch
and a bowl of nibbles.)

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.680
Mrs Hudson, you are a saint.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.080
If it was Monday,
I'd have been to the supermarket.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.640
Thank you. Thank you.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.480
SIRENS PASS BY

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.400
So these numbers, it's a cipher?
Exactly.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.800
And each pair of numbers is a word?

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.800
How did you know that?

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.520
Well, two words
have already been translated. Here.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.320
John. Mmm?

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320
John, look at this.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.760
Soo Lin at the museum, she started
to translate the code for us.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.440
We didn't see it.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.520
Nine mill.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.960
Does that mean millions?

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.000
Nine million quid. For what?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.120
We need to know
the end of this sentence.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.680
Where are you going?

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.480
To the museum, to the restoration
room. We must have been
staring right at it. At what?

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.400
The book, John. The book.
The key to cracking the cipher.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.520
Soo Lin used it to do this. Whilst
we were running around the gallery,

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.040
she started to translate the code.
It must be on her desk.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.200
Taxi!

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.640
ANGRY VOICE

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.320
Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320
Ja, danke(!)

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.080
THEY MUTTER

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.480
INAUDIBLE

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.280
A book that everybody would own.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.080
Please, wait!

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.760
Bitte!

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.840
Was wollt er?

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.480
Hey, du, was machst du?

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.680
Minute!
Gib mir doch mein Buch zuruck!

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.000
Yeah. No, absolutely.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.040
I mean, a quiet night in
is just what the doctor ordered.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.960
I mean, I love to go out of an
evening and wrestle a few Chinese
gangsters generally,

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.080
but a girl can get too much. OK.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.360
Er, shall we get a takeaway?

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.920
Yeah.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.120
Page 15, entry 1...

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.200
Page 15, entry 1.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.240
Dead man.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.960
You were threatening to kill them.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.680
That's the first cipher.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.400
9... 0... 15...

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.840
er, 15 and 36.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.040
36, 39, 39...

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.800
39...

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.280
9...

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.160
"Nine", "mill", "for"...

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.840
KNOCK AT DOOR

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.200
Blimey, that was quick.
I'll just pop down.

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.840
Do you want me to lay the table?

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.920
Um...eat off trays? Yeah.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.720
70...35...

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.360
Jade...

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.320
Jade.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.840
Sorry to keep you.
How much do you want?

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.520
Do you have it? What?

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.080
Do you have the treasure?
I don't understand.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.800
MUTTERS

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.720
"Nine mill for Jade pin.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.680
"Dragon den, black...

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.160
"tramway."

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.760
DOOR SHUTS

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.600
HOLMES: John! John, I've got it.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:52.480
The cipher, the book. It's the
London A-Z that they're us...

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.560
WOMAN: A book is like
a magic garden,

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.960
carried in your pocket.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.920
Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes.
I'm...

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.480
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.000
Forgive me
if I do not take your word for it.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.480
Ow!

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.680
Debit card, name of...

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.840
S Holmes.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.960
Take my card.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.080
Yes, that's not actually mine.
He lent that to me.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:58.040
And a cheque for £5,000 made out
in the name of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.480
Yeah, he gave me that to look after.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.480
Tickets from the theatre
collected by you, name of Holmes.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.720
Yes, OK.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.160
What's the name?
Er, Holmes.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.000
I realise what this looks like.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.640
But I'm not him.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.280
We heard it from your own mouth.
What?

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.360
"I am Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone."

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.400
Because no-one else can compete with
my massive intellect.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.560
Did I really say that?

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.720
I suppose there's no use me trying
to persuade you I was doing
an impression.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.200
I am Shan.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.960
You're... You're Shan?

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.360
Three times we tried to kill you
and your companion, Mr Holmes.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:48.000
What does it tell you when an
assassin cannot shoot straight?

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.600
GUN COCKS

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.000
GUN CLICKS

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.320
It tells you
that they're not really trying.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.720
Tramway.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.840
There.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:35.120
Not blank bullets now. OK.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.160
If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes,
we would have done it by now.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.960
We just wanted to
make you inquisitive.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.840
Do you have it?
Do I have what?

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.360
The treasure. I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.440
I would prefer to make certain.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.080
Everything in the West
has its price.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.960
And the price for her life -
information.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.080
SARAH GROANS

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.280
(I'm sorry. I'm sorry.)

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.520
Where's the hairpin? What?

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.440
The Empress pin
valued at £9 million sterling?

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.720
We already had a buyer in the West

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.960
and then one of our people
was greedy, he took it,

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.240
brought it back to London, and you,
Mr Holmes, have been searching.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:46.520
Please, please. Listen to me.
I'm not...

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.840
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
You have to believe me.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.680
I haven't found whatever it is
you're looking for.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.800
I need a volunteer from
the audience. No, please, please!

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.320
Ah, thank you, lady.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.480
Yes, you'll do very nicely.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.480
MUFFLED GROANS

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:30.960
Ladies and gentlemen, from the
distant, moonlit shores of NW1,

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.640
we present for your pleasure,

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:40.680
Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion
in a death-defying act. Please!

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.520
You've seen the act before.
How dull for you.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.080
You know how it ends.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.000
I'm not Sherlock Holmes!

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.520
I don't believe you.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.440
You should, you know.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.480
Sherlock Holmes
is nothing at all like him.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:02.040
How would you describe me, John?

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.920
Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?
Late?

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.480
That's a semi-automatic.
If you fire it,

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.320
the bullet will travel at
over 1,000 metres per second.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.840
Well?

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.200
Well...
THUMP

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.400
..the radius curvature of these
walls is nearly four metres.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.680
If you miss,
the bullet will ricochet.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.360
Could hit anyone.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.280
Might even bounce off the tunnel
and hit you.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.840
WHOOSH
THUMP

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:26.280
GROANS

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.080
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.920
It's all right.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.080
GRUNTS

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.400
You're going to be all right.
It's over now.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.000
Don't worry.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.040
Next date won't be like this.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.480
We'll just slip off. No need
to mention us in your report.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.600
Mr Holmes... I have high hopes
for you, Inspector.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.920
A glittering career.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.960
I go where you point me.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.480
Exactly.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.000
POURING LIQUID

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.680
WATSON: Ta.

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.440
So, nine million. Million.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:42.800
Million, yes. Nine million for
Jade pin dragon den black tramway.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.280
An instruction
to all their London operatives.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.960
A message.
What they were trying to reclaim.

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.800
What, a jade pin?
Worth £9 million.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.120
Bring it to the Tramway,
their London hideout.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.720
Hang on. A hairpin worth £9 million?

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.960
Apparently. Why so much?

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.120
Depends who owned it.

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.080
Two operatives based in London.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.960
They travel over to Dalian
to smuggle those vases.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.320
One of them helps himself
to something, a little hairpin.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.800
Worth £9 million.
Eddie Van Coon was the thief,

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.800
he stole the treasure
when he was in China.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.480
How do you know it was Van Coon,
not Lukis?

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.560
Even the killer didn't know that.
Because of the soap.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.560
PHONE RINGS

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.080
Amanda?
HOLMES: He brought you a present.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.560
Oh, hello.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.240
A little gift
when he came back from China.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:45.640
How do you know that?
You weren't just his PA, were you?

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.240
Someone's been gossiping.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.080
No. Then I don't understand why...

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.040
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.480
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.480
Sorry...? I don't think Eddie
Van Coon was the type of chap
to buy himself hand soap,

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.600
not unless he had
a lady coming over.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.200
And it's the same brand as that
hand cream there on your desk.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.840
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.440
It was over in a flash,
it couldn't last. He was my boss.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.040
What happened? Why did you end it?

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.040
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.840
Took me for granted.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.160
Stood me up once too often.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.960
We'd plan to go away for the weekend,
and then he'd just leave.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.720
Fly off to China
at a moment's notice.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.960
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.680
Can I just have a look at it?

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.640
He really climbed up
onto the balcony?

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:52.720
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.640
Thanks.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.080
He said he bought it
in a street market.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.000
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.520
Yeah, that's Eddie.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.960
Didn't know its value,
just thought it would suit you.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.880
Oh? What's it worth?

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.080
£9 million.

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.320
Oh, my God.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.880
Oh, my God!

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.000
Nine million?!

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.680
Over 1,000 years old

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.840
and it's sitting on her bedside table
every night.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.880
He didn't know its value. Didn't
know why they were chasing him.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.120
Should've just got her a lucky cat.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.520
You mind, don't you? What?

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.480
That she escaped. General Shan.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.440
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.240
Must be a vast network, John.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.000
Thousands of operatives.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.520
You and I,
we barely scratched the surface.

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.640
You cracked the code though,
Sherlock.

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.480
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them now he knows it.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.920
No. No, I crack this code,

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.000
all the smugglers have to do
is pick up another book.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.960
SIREN BLARES

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.080
Without you...

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:50.080
without your assistance,

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.360
we would not have found
passage into London.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.800
You have my thanks.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.640
We did not anticipate...

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.240
We did not know this man would come.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.760
This Sherlock Holmes.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.840
And now your safety is compromised.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.240
I will not reveal your identity.

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.340
