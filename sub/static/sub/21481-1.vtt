00:39.624 --> 00:42.434
<i>We're not a threat.
We're salvation.</i>

00:42.594 --> 00:44.574
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.664 --> 00:48.610
<i>Previously on "The 4400"...</i>

00:48.767 --> 00:51.646
<i>What? So Navarro was really
some kind of mind reader?</i>

00:51.803 --> 00:54.079
I believe "telepath" is the word
you're looking for.

00:54.239 --> 00:56.913
Just concentrate
on what you wanna ask me,

00:57.075 --> 00:58.281
and I'll hear you.

00:58.343 --> 00:59.945
He definitely knew
what we were thinking.

01:00.111 --> 01:02.113
<i>I can think of a few
practical applications for it.</i>

01:02.280 --> 01:03.918
<i>You should've come to me first.</i>

01:04.081 --> 01:06.028
<i>I'd have treated you better
than they ever will.</i>

01:06.184 --> 01:08.721
<i>We're at war here.
Don't pick the losing side.</i>

01:08.887 --> 01:13.734
There's a synthetic substance present
in the blood of every 4400.

01:13.892 --> 01:16.771
<i>They can it promicin inhibitor.</i>

01:16.928 --> 01:18.888
NTAC's been studying the 4400
since they got back.

01:18.963 --> 01:20.499
- They should've known.
- They do know.

01:20.665 --> 01:23.976
I was ordered to work on a drug
to suppress the production of promicin.

01:24.135 --> 01:27.275
Once I synthesized the inhibitor,
we gave it to every 4400.

01:27.439 --> 01:29.112
But if it comes down to a choice

01:29.274 --> 01:31.481
between the safety
of the American people

01:31.643 --> 01:36.854
and the welfare of the 4400, Tom,
that's no choice at all.

01:37.015 --> 01:39.695
Because if you're holding on to
any hope of keeping this covered up,

01:39.751 --> 01:43.164
you're gonna have to start by putting
me in the ground right here, right now.

01:43.922 --> 01:46.698
<i>Every male in this building
has got a gallon of adrenaline</i>

01:46.858 --> 01:49.498
<i>coursing through his veins right now,
and most of them are armed.</i>

01:51.129 --> 01:53.939
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,

01:54.099 --> 01:55.699
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.

01:56.201 --> 01:58.681
I wasn't pregnant
when I was abducted,

01:58.837 --> 02:00.339
but I was when I got back.

02:00.505 --> 02:01.865
<i>You've seen what she's capable of,</i>

02:01.973 --> 02:03.646
<i>what she can do
when she feels threatened.</i>

02:03.808 --> 02:05.446
<i>You know Isabelle has connections</i>

02:05.610 --> 02:07.681
<i>between the right
and left hemispheres of her brain</i>

02:07.846 --> 02:09.166
<i>that have never been seen before.</i>

02:09.247 --> 02:10.692
<i>You are the stewards of the future.</i>

02:10.848 --> 02:12.294
Your daughter is the Rosetta stone

02:12.450 --> 02:14.170
for understanding
what happened to the 4400.

02:15.253 --> 02:17.062
Isabelle?

02:20.325 --> 02:21.395
Isabelle!

02:21.960 --> 02:24.372
Hello, Shawn. I'm Isabelle.

02:31.636 --> 02:32.876
The world has changed.

02:33.471 --> 02:35.576
Everything is different now.

02:35.740 --> 02:38.060
The Promicin Inhibitor Program
was an international effort.

02:39.310 --> 02:42.154
Its goal was to prevent
the coming of a world

02:42.313 --> 02:45.260
dominated by a tiny fraction
of the population.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.919
In short, we were doing
everything we could

02:48.086 --> 02:52.557
to prevent the 4400 from developing
extra-human capabilities.

02:52.724 --> 02:55.500
We believe
that without the inhibitor program,

02:55.660 --> 02:58.220
<i>these abilities would show up
in virtually every one of the 4400.</i>

03:01.266 --> 03:03.186
<i>I don't think I need to explain
to this committee</i>

03:03.301 --> 03:07.010
<i>why that would be something less
than the best-case scenario.</i>

03:08.506 --> 03:10.383
<i>Overnight, normal human beings
like you and I,</i>

03:10.542 --> 03:12.342
<i>and all the institutions
we've come to rely on</i>

03:13.878 --> 03:15.619
<i>would be obsolete.</i>

03:20.451 --> 03:24.058
<i>The program wasn't perfect.
People got sick. Some died.</i>

03:24.222 --> 03:25.530
<i>That was not our intent.</i>

03:26.858 --> 03:28.838
<i>But now it's gone.</i>

03:30.361 --> 03:32.481
<i>And the future that we were trying
to prevent is here,</i>

03:32.530 --> 03:35.033
<i>and we are not ready.</i>

03:36.501 --> 03:38.674
<i>I believe it comes down
to a question of power.</i>

03:40.004 --> 03:43.383
<i>Us or them?</i>

03:43.541 --> 03:50.151
Because, believe me, it's going
to come down to us against them.

03:58.389 --> 04:01.461
Shawn, you're not making any sense.
Just tell me what's wrong with Isabelle.

04:01.626 --> 04:03.936
I told you, I can't explain.

04:04.095 --> 04:05.972
Is she sick? Is she hurt?

04:06.130 --> 04:08.235
You gotta see for yourself.

04:10.101 --> 04:11.409
Dad.

04:12.737 --> 04:14.648
Who the hell is this?
Where's Isabelle?

04:15.006 --> 04:17.077
I am your daughter. I'm Isabelle.

04:21.144 --> 04:23.648
- I don't get it.
- It's not a joke.

04:23.815 --> 04:26.557
Something happened. I changed.
I don't know how.

04:26.718 --> 04:28.129
She just walked in here.

04:28.286 --> 04:30.526
She knew my name. She seems
to know about you and Lily...

04:30.555 --> 04:31.863
Stop.

04:33.491 --> 04:36.961
I don't know what game
you're playing here, and I don't care.

04:37.595 --> 04:39.597
Richard. Richard...

04:43.601 --> 04:44.636
Lily.

04:45.970 --> 04:47.643
Lily.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.441
Lily?

04:50.408 --> 04:51.648
Is Isabelle with you?

04:52.910 --> 04:54.719
Lily? Lil...

04:57.348 --> 04:59.692
Lily, are you all right?

04:59.851 --> 05:02.491
Oh, Richard. I must've fainted.

05:03.755 --> 05:05.132
Is Isabelle with you?

05:06.457 --> 05:08.733
Who are you? Where's my wife?

05:08.893 --> 05:11.396
Richard, what are you talking about?

05:11.963 --> 05:14.341
I'm Lily, your wife.

05:14.499 --> 05:15.978
Why are you looking at me like...?

05:19.137 --> 05:22.141
- Oh, my God.
- Ma'am, I don't know who you are.

05:31.549 --> 05:32.653
Oh, my God.

05:41.592 --> 05:42.696
No!

05:45.863 --> 05:49.072
Your blood pressure is elevated.

05:49.233 --> 05:52.009
But I suppose that's to be expected.

05:52.170 --> 05:56.846
Heart, lungs, reflexes,
all within the normal range.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.768
Doctor, you call this normal?

05:58.876 --> 06:01.789
Richard, I wanna see Isabelle.
Where is my daughter?

06:01.946 --> 06:03.946
She's right outside.
<i>I'll</i> bring her in in a minute.

06:04.048 --> 06:06.756
I realize how alarming this must be.

06:06.918 --> 06:08.838
But at least you can take
some solace in the fact

06:08.920 --> 06:11.059
that your wife is a perfectly healthy
older woman.

06:11.222 --> 06:14.203
If I had to guess,
I'd say she's about 75.

06:14.359 --> 06:17.101
I'm 29, and I don't understand.

06:17.261 --> 06:21.266
Please, help me understand.
How could this happen?

06:21.933 --> 06:26.040
Maybe it's a reaction to being taken off
the promicin inhibitor.

06:26.204 --> 06:27.911
But truthfully, I don't know.

06:28.072 --> 06:32.987
There is a condition called progeria.
It's associated with rapid aging.

06:33.144 --> 06:36.455
So this kind of thing
has happened before?

06:36.614 --> 06:40.221
Mr. Tyler, when your wife
fainted this morning,

06:40.385 --> 06:41.386
she was a young woman.

06:41.552 --> 06:43.657
When she woke up
less than a minute later,

06:43.821 --> 06:47.064
she was 50 years older.

06:47.225 --> 06:51.435
I can guarantee you, this is a first.

06:53.297 --> 06:55.106
Excuse me.

06:58.569 --> 07:01.812
- Are you okay, Dr. Burkhoff?
- I'm fine. Not enough sleep, that's all.

07:01.973 --> 07:03.577
Research.

07:03.741 --> 07:07.814
Well, what do we do now?
Is there any way to reverse this?

07:07.979 --> 07:13.292
I wish I knew.
I need to do some thinking.

07:21.893 --> 07:23.770
Are you my mother?

07:35.173 --> 07:37.016
Isabelle?

08:01.833 --> 08:06.145
Every day, the 4400 are changing
and getting stronger.

08:06.304 --> 08:08.750
Instead of mobilizing
to meet this challenge,

08:08.906 --> 08:12.649
we're wringing our hands and trying
to determine who knew what when.

08:13.077 --> 08:17.651
I will save this committee the trouble
and expense of a long investigation.

08:17.815 --> 08:20.193
The inhibitor program was my idea.

08:20.585 --> 08:22.929
I was proud to lead it.

08:23.087 --> 08:26.330
The men on this board
were simply following my orders.

08:26.491 --> 08:30.234
If there's blame to be assigned,
it's mine.

08:30.394 --> 08:32.203
Mine alone.

08:33.898 --> 08:35.418
Yeah, I know Kyle
doesn't wanna see me.

08:35.566 --> 08:37.068
Is there some way
we can force him to?

08:37.235 --> 08:39.875
I'm his father.
I wanna know how he's doing.

08:40.037 --> 08:41.236
Look, I realize you're trying,

08:41.371 --> 08:44.319
but it'll be months before he goes
to trial, I'm not gonna wait that long.

08:44.475 --> 08:46.995
Do you really think people
are gonna let Ryland position himself

08:47.044 --> 08:48.364
as some kind of patriotic martyr?

08:48.446 --> 08:51.290
The man headed a conspiracy
that caused 28 deaths.

08:51.449 --> 08:52.655
He says it was accidental.

08:52.817 --> 08:55.024
A significant percentage
of this country believes him.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.757
Try overwhelming.
You guys listen to talk radio lately?

08:57.922 --> 09:00.095
I mean, the calls are, like,
90 percent in his favor.

09:00.258 --> 09:02.858
You can buy a "Free Dennis Ryland"
T-shirt within a block of here.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.201
Maybe they should put him up
for the Nobel Peace Prize.

09:05.363 --> 09:08.124
Just tell him I need to see him.
We don't have to talk about the case.

09:08.266 --> 09:10.872
I just have to see my son.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.311
Just ask him one more time, okay?

09:15.473 --> 09:18.511
And tell him we love him.

09:20.278 --> 09:21.848
Give him some time, Thomas.

09:22.013 --> 09:25.085
Kyle needs to live with his choice
for a while.

09:25.716 --> 09:27.525
We're back.

09:29.153 --> 09:31.963
Tom, break's over.

09:47.838 --> 09:51.445
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to call the proceedings to order.

09:51.609 --> 09:53.850
Everyone, just take your seats
so we can get started.

09:54.545 --> 09:56.145
Members of the press,
I was including you

09:56.247 --> 09:59.421
in that "ladies and gentlemen"
designation, thank you.

10:00.451 --> 10:05.127
Mr. Ryland, I'd like to pick up
the questioning where we left off.

10:05.289 --> 10:07.428
You insist that you alone
gave the go-ahead

10:07.592 --> 10:10.300
for the Promicin Inhibitor Program,
is that right, sir?

10:10.461 --> 10:12.668
Yes, sir.
It was my program all the way.

10:12.830 --> 10:16.505
So this committee is to understand
that your department

10:16.667 --> 10:18.948
was able to plan and implement
an international conspiracy

10:20.838 --> 10:22.977
without some
Cabinet-level approval?

10:23.140 --> 10:25.381
That's correct.
I was given a broad mandate

10:25.543 --> 10:28.046
in my duties as head of NTAC.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.852
I felt that the project fell
within that mandate.

10:31.015 --> 10:34.292
So there was no need
to seek outside approval...

10:37.321 --> 10:40.461
- Excuse us, everybody.
- Did you hear that?

10:40.625 --> 10:42.298
Well, yeah, the microphones
went haywire.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.701
No, not that. Something else.

10:45.162 --> 10:48.075
Just set that approval issue to the side
for the moment.

10:50.368 --> 10:53.838
Did you ever discuss the project
with anyone outside of NTAC?

10:54.005 --> 10:56.212
I mean, someone, somewhere,
must have taken an interest

10:56.374 --> 10:58.081
in what your people
were doing over there.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.744
- Listen to me.
- What? What's wrong?

10:59.910 --> 11:02.590
- A simple question, Mr. Ryland.
- What do you mean, "What's wrong"?

11:03.648 --> 11:06.959
Surely, it can't be that difficult
to answer.

11:07.752 --> 11:09.752
If I could have your attention
up here, Mr. Ryland.

11:09.820 --> 11:11.857
You need to relax, Miles.

11:21.065 --> 11:23.170
Security! Stop that man!

11:29.340 --> 11:32.116
Get some protection on Ryland.
Stay here. I'll be right back.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.552
We need an ambulance!
Someone call an ambulance!

11:34.712 --> 11:36.214
Stand back, please. Back. Back.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.723
Hey!

11:58.569 --> 12:00.242
Stop! T.J.!

12:10.881 --> 12:12.986
Someone get these photographers
out of here.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.527
You stay with him.

12:14.685 --> 12:17.029
I don't understand what I did.

12:17.188 --> 12:20.692
Would somebody please tell me
what I just did?

12:22.693 --> 12:25.867
Hang on, Dennis.
The ambulance is coming.

12:33.504 --> 12:34.642
Yeah, it was her.

12:34.805 --> 12:37.615
The blood we picked up at the scene
matches the DNA in our records.

12:37.775 --> 12:39.575
That was T.J. Kim running
from the courthouse.

12:39.677 --> 12:42.077
When she hit this place,
T.J. drove every man in the building

12:42.146 --> 12:43.284
into a homicidal rage.

12:43.447 --> 12:45.791
Now it sounds like
she just zapped one guy.

12:45.950 --> 12:48.521
She's learning to control
what she can do. They all are.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.326
Ever since we took them off
the inhibitor,

12:50.454 --> 12:52.024
they're either developing
new abilities,

12:52.189 --> 12:54.066
or they're refining the ones
that they've got.

12:54.225 --> 12:57.297
So they are getting more dangerous.
I guess Ryland was right.

12:57.461 --> 12:59.181
I'll be sure to mention that
to my daughter.

12:59.263 --> 13:01.209
Okay, save the point-counterpoint.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.205
At the moment,
we've been tasked with two jobs.

13:03.334 --> 13:06.315
We track down T.J. Kim.
What's the second job?

13:06.470 --> 13:08.279
We are to protect Ryland's
co-conspirators

13:08.439 --> 13:09.519
from any further reprisals.

13:09.673 --> 13:11.633
So we arrest them,
and now we're their bodyguards?

13:11.776 --> 13:15.087
Well, the entire country just saw
a 4400 turn a government hearing

13:15.246 --> 13:16.691
into her own personal slasher film.

13:17.014 --> 13:20.393
If T.J. gets to Ryland again, or any
of them, before we can bring her in,

13:20.551 --> 13:23.071
people are gonna start to wonder
if the United States government

13:23.120 --> 13:24.640
is capable of protecting its citizens.

13:25.122 --> 13:27.159
And that's the beginning of chaos.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.298
Back to work, please.

13:38.869 --> 13:40.371
Tom.

13:40.704 --> 13:45.278
In case you're wondering,
Dennis is still in surgery.

13:45.442 --> 13:48.286
They say that it is touch-and-go.

14:16.574 --> 14:19.214
It's okay. Give me your hands.
Try and relax.

14:19.376 --> 14:20.616
Relax.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.004
Is it better?

14:44.835 --> 14:46.644
Much better.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.910
For now.

14:55.913 --> 14:58.189
When this thing first me on,
it was bad,

14:58.349 --> 14:59.623
but at least she was healthy.

14:59.783 --> 15:01.626
Now she's had diabetes,
emphysema.

15:01.785 --> 15:03.505
Seems like every day,
there's something new.

15:03.587 --> 15:05.123
I'll come help her every day.

15:05.289 --> 15:06.893
Listen, we got everyone
working on this.

15:07.057 --> 15:08.331
We're gonna figure it out.

15:08.492 --> 15:11.701
- Is my mother okay?
- Yeah.

15:12.263 --> 15:15.005
She had a little problem.
Shawn fixed it.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.304
It's all in the wrists.

15:17.868 --> 15:18.938
Can I see her?

15:22.873 --> 15:24.079
Please?

15:32.616 --> 15:34.220
Mom?

15:37.955 --> 15:39.866
Isabelle.

15:41.025 --> 15:44.131
- Come here.
- Is there anything I can do?

15:44.695 --> 15:49.110
I'm fine. Really. Sit down.

15:54.405 --> 15:56.817
You were such a beautiful baby.

15:56.974 --> 15:59.420
I used to hold you all daylong.

15:59.576 --> 16:03.285
I knew exactly what you were feeling,
what you wanted.

16:03.681 --> 16:04.989
We were so close.

16:05.149 --> 16:08.892
I'm sorry for growing up so fast.
I didn't mean to.

16:09.053 --> 16:10.999
I didn't want to.

16:11.789 --> 16:13.996
Neither did I.

16:18.896 --> 16:23.140
Crazy thing is, I keep thinking
about Patty, Ryland's wife.

16:23.300 --> 16:26.179
I feel like I should call her
or something, help her through this.

16:26.337 --> 16:29.147
Maybe you should. You and Ryland
were friends for a long time.

16:29.974 --> 16:31.146
It's okay to be conflicted.

16:31.308 --> 16:34.812
Yeah, well, Ryland's little experiment
almost got you killed. Shawn too.

16:34.979 --> 16:37.740
The guy knew that Kyle was stalking
Jordan Collier and he did nothing.

16:37.815 --> 16:39.556
I'd say that trumps friendship.

16:41.085 --> 16:42.826
You have so much on your mind.

16:43.287 --> 16:46.461
Kyle, Ryland, the 4400s.

16:46.623 --> 16:49.900
I need to get you away from here,
away from your problems.

16:50.060 --> 16:53.564
Yeah, well, it sounds nice.
But I can't go anywhere.

16:53.731 --> 16:56.268
I'm starting investigation
in the morning.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.344
What if I told you
I could take you away

16:58.502 --> 17:00.778
between now and then?

17:02.473 --> 17:04.180
My ability.

17:04.340 --> 17:10.189
Since I'm off the inhibitor,
I think I can control it now.

17:10.881 --> 17:12.883
What, you mean you wanna...?

17:13.050 --> 17:15.490
You wanna take me into another
dream world? Alternate real...?

17:15.519 --> 17:18.363
- I don't even know what to call it.
- Call it a vacation.

17:18.521 --> 17:23.368
A week. A year. As long as we want.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.066
All that in the space
of a few moments.

17:28.031 --> 17:29.875
Should we try it?

17:30.734 --> 17:33.340
What, right here? Now?

17:34.938 --> 17:38.545
- What do we do?
- We're already doing it.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.060
There's no one on the beach.

17:51.221 --> 17:54.600
It's all ours, Thomas, so is the hotel.

17:54.758 --> 17:57.500
We can stay here
for as long as we like.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.504
There is no jet lag.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.940
That sounds perfect.
It is perfect too.

18:27.124 --> 18:28.797
The door's open. Come in.

18:32.129 --> 18:34.439
What? What is it?

18:36.433 --> 18:38.811
- You're naked.
- I'm more comfortable this way.

18:38.969 --> 18:41.643
Haven't really gotten used
to them. Clothes.

18:42.306 --> 18:43.717
I have a bathrobe.

18:49.213 --> 18:51.159
Is this better?

18:53.450 --> 18:55.225
Almost.

18:57.454 --> 18:58.990
Just...

19:14.638 --> 19:16.515
Never met anybody
that read the encyclopedia

19:16.673 --> 19:18.983
- from cover to cover before.
- Oh, I'm not finished.

19:19.143 --> 19:22.147
I just delivered those
to you yesterday.

19:22.980 --> 19:25.517
Okay, you're a fast reader.
That's really cool.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.654
Listen, they're looking for you
down in the labs.

19:28.819 --> 19:29.854
You're like an hour late.

19:30.220 --> 19:31.858
They sent you to get me?

19:34.458 --> 19:36.904
- Aren't you in charge?
- Well, yeah, more or less.

19:37.060 --> 19:38.539
You know, I go where I'm needed.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.204
They were scared of me,
weren't they?

19:41.365 --> 19:42.742
- Pretty much.
- That's all right.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.538
I think my parents are frightened of me.

19:44.701 --> 19:46.703
I don't think your mom and dad
are scared of you.

19:46.870 --> 19:48.070
I think they're just confused.

19:48.172 --> 19:51.085
I don't blame them.
It's mostly how I feel too.

19:51.241 --> 19:53.915
I don't understand
what happened to me.

19:54.077 --> 19:56.216
I don't understand
what happened to my mother.

19:56.580 --> 20:02.258
And I'm trying to read and learn things,
but mostly, I just...

20:02.519 --> 20:04.362
I still feel lost.

20:04.855 --> 20:07.597
See, now you sound like
a real 4400.

20:08.091 --> 20:11.129
But I'm not a 4400.

20:11.662 --> 20:17.442
Not like my mother and father,
or you.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.648
Looks like I'm gonna live.

20:24.074 --> 20:26.748
Sorry to disappoint you, Tom.

20:29.012 --> 20:30.582
Why'd you ask to see me, Dennis?

20:31.248 --> 20:35.424
I hear that you and Skouris
are in charge of the investigation.

20:35.586 --> 20:37.793
Yeah. We know who did it.
We'll find her.

20:38.288 --> 20:42.100
T.J. Kim attacked this building
six weeks ago.

20:42.259 --> 20:44.102
No one's tracked her down yet?

20:44.261 --> 20:46.639
We got a little sidetracked
cleaning up your mess, Dennis.

20:46.797 --> 20:49.141
Did you ever think
that maybe she has help?

20:49.299 --> 20:55.716
Other 4400s who feel the same way
about the government she does?

20:55.872 --> 20:57.442
When we catch her, we'll ask.

20:58.809 --> 20:59.844
Will you?

21:01.111 --> 21:06.185
I wanna make sure you're gonna take
this thing as far as it goes, Tom.

21:06.350 --> 21:09.297
The same way you did
when you came after me.

21:10.954 --> 21:14.800
And I want my people protected.

21:14.958 --> 21:17.029
They were acting under my orders.

21:17.194 --> 21:18.195
They're under guard.

21:18.362 --> 21:21.036
So was the courthouse
when Kim attacked.

21:21.565 --> 21:26.378
I'd feel better if you brought them in.

21:27.404 --> 21:30.442
We offered sanctuary
to every single conspirator.

21:30.607 --> 21:32.177
There were no takers.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.304
<i>I guess no one wanted to cooperate</i>

21:35.412 --> 21:37.824
<i>with the organization
that was working to put you in prison.</i>

21:37.981 --> 21:39.621
<i>We had to fight
just to get them to let us</i>

21:39.716 --> 21:41.696
<i>post agents outside their houses.</i>

21:41.852 --> 21:45.129
Crocket, are you ready to go
for a walk, boy?

21:46.189 --> 21:47.395
Come on, Crocket. Let's go.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.036
They wanted no part of us.

21:49.192 --> 21:53.106
They all seemed confident
that T.J. Kim was acting alone.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.570
Crock?

21:59.736 --> 22:01.215
What's wrong? It's me.

22:37.240 --> 22:40.312
This just arrived 15 minutes ago.

22:41.311 --> 22:43.222
<i>This is a message
from the Nova Group.</i>

22:43.380 --> 22:46.259
<i>We are the defensive wing
of the 4400.</i>

22:46.416 --> 22:47.588
<i>Today, the world has seen</i>

22:47.751 --> 22:50.027
<i>what happens to those
who try to harm us.</i>

22:50.187 --> 22:52.189
<i>A second demonstration
of our capabilities</i>

22:52.356 --> 22:54.734
<i>is planned for October 19th.</i>

22:54.891 --> 22:56.370
<i>A new era dawns.</i>

22:56.526 --> 22:57.869
Defensive wing, huh?

22:58.061 --> 22:59.861
What happens
when they decide to play offense?

22:59.963 --> 23:02.683
- I guess we find out in five days.
- They didn't say what they want.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.642
No demands.
No room for compromise.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.041
We don't even know how many 4400s
are in this Nova Group.

23:07.170 --> 23:10.049
We couldn't handle one when she
walked in here and attacked the place.

23:10.207 --> 23:12.887
Now there's a whole team of assassins
out there, all with abilities?

23:12.943 --> 23:15.981
They got someone who can kill you
by lowering your body temperature.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.716
Don't forget the beast master.

23:17.881 --> 23:19.952
What? That dog got pissed off
pretty quick.

23:20.117 --> 23:21.277
I've been all over the files,

23:21.418 --> 23:23.898
and none of these abilities
have been registered with us.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.094
They're off the inhibitor now.
We can't even pretend

23:26.156 --> 23:28.396
to have a comprehensive list
of what these people can do.

23:28.492 --> 23:32.235
Is anyone else feeling
a little overmatched here?

23:40.404 --> 23:42.645
You two remember Gary Navarro?

23:43.840 --> 23:46.616
Hey, Gary. Been a while.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.888
You're right, Baldwin.

23:50.046 --> 23:51.923
I do think you two sold me out.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.618
It really bothered me for a while,

23:53.784 --> 23:56.144
but now I understand
it's just standard operating procedure.

23:56.219 --> 23:58.779
Well, I guess that mind-reading thing's
working pretty well, huh?

23:58.855 --> 23:59.935
Better than ever, actually.

24:00.056 --> 24:01.976
Gary's telepathic abilities
have been very useful

24:02.125 --> 24:03.934
to the National Security Agency.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.934
They've agreed to let us borrow him
while we investigate the Nova Group.

24:06.963 --> 24:08.283
You're clear on what we're doing?

24:08.365 --> 24:11.005
You want to use a 4400
to track down other 4400s.

24:11.168 --> 24:13.114
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Not at all.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.815
It won't be my first time.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.683
So can we get started?

24:23.380 --> 24:26.418
Never heard of the Nova Group.
Not until this morning, anyway.

24:26.583 --> 24:28.103
Now I gotta go on television
in an hour

24:28.218 --> 24:30.562
and explain that the Center
had nothing to do with this.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.721
Shawn.

24:32.222 --> 24:34.725
I know there's a lot of history
between NTAC and this place.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.893
But I trust you realize
how serious this is.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.700
Believe me, if I knew anything,
I would tell you.

24:39.863 --> 24:42.183
Well, do you mind if the three of us
walk around the place,

24:42.332 --> 24:44.292
- talk to people?
- You and your pet mind reader'?

24:44.401 --> 24:45.812
No, I can't let you do that.

24:45.969 --> 24:47.569
These people
haven't done anything wrong.

24:47.671 --> 24:49.151
I won't let you invade their privacy.

24:49.239 --> 24:51.879
And I actually can't believe
that you brought this guy here again.

24:52.676 --> 24:54.849
How much do they pay you
to spy on your own kind?

24:55.011 --> 24:58.185
Are you getting a clear signal?
See anything you like up there?

25:00.817 --> 25:02.657
As far as I can tell,
he's not hiding anything.

25:04.788 --> 25:07.962
I have a lot of work to do.
If I hear anything, I'll give you a call.

25:08.124 --> 25:10.365
For now, that's the best I can do.

25:21.805 --> 25:23.011
Sorry about my nephew.

25:23.874 --> 25:26.286
- Why?
- He was kind of rude back there.

25:26.443 --> 25:29.014
I get that kind of stuff a lot.
I don't take it personally.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.283
You mind if I ask you...?

25:30.447 --> 25:34.122
You've sort of implied
that you've pursued 4400s in the past.

25:34.284 --> 25:36.355
What exactly do you do
for the NSA?

25:36.520 --> 25:39.626
- Overseas stuff, mostly.
- But like what? Give me an example.

25:40.156 --> 25:41.760
They fly me someplace.

25:41.925 --> 25:44.565
I approach the subject,
find out what he's thinking.

25:44.728 --> 25:46.435
And I tell the people I work for,

25:46.596 --> 25:48.803
who then fly me home
where I live comfortably.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.740
What happens to the subject?

25:52.402 --> 25:53.779
I don't ask.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.055
That's good.

26:07.217 --> 26:09.720
The neural pathway comparisons
are particularly illuminating.

26:09.886 --> 26:11.806
Make sure you understand them
before you move on.

26:12.122 --> 26:14.966
Dr. Burkhoff,
I don't understand any of this.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.731
A bunch of her neurons
don't work anymore.

26:17.894 --> 26:20.568
Every time one of hers turns off,
one of mine turns on.

26:20.730 --> 26:21.970
Exactly.

26:22.132 --> 26:23.907
And what's true for neurons

26:24.067 --> 26:26.479
is true for muscle fibers,
synaptic pathways.

26:26.903 --> 26:31.079
There is a one-to-one
correspondence

26:31.241 --> 26:34.154
between the amount you lost
and the amount you gained.

26:34.311 --> 26:36.592
So all this is just a way
of saying I'm doing this to her?

26:36.746 --> 26:40.284
The correlation is too precise
to be random.

26:40.450 --> 26:45.126
Your rapid aging
has caused her rapid aging.

26:45.288 --> 26:47.461
How do we stop it?
Put me back the way I was?

26:47.624 --> 26:50.104
- I'm afraid I can't.
- So, what do we do about it?

26:50.260 --> 26:54.834
There is a possibility
that if the aging agent were eliminated,

26:54.998 --> 26:57.478
that Lily might be restored
to her normal self.

26:57.634 --> 27:00.171
- The aging agent?
- He means me.

27:00.337 --> 27:01.611
I'm killing you.

27:01.771 --> 27:04.291
The only way for you to live
is for me to die. Isn't that right?

27:04.407 --> 27:06.080
Don't answer that, Dr. Burkhoff.

27:06.242 --> 27:09.519
Thank you for your time,
but we're done here.

27:10.180 --> 27:12.091
Where are you going?

27:12.482 --> 27:14.962
We're not discussing this.

27:15.118 --> 27:16.324
Not now.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.691
Not ever.

27:26.296 --> 27:29.766
- It's true, isn't it?
- I think so.

27:35.271 --> 27:36.716
But it's only a theory.

27:38.775 --> 27:41.153
Guys, I went over this six weeks ago
with the men in black.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.415
Humor us.

27:42.579 --> 27:45.719
I went on two dates with T.J. Kim.
Then I cut it off.

27:45.882 --> 27:47.962
- Girl had a lot of baggage.
- How long ago was that?

27:48.051 --> 27:49.428
About two months ago.

27:49.586 --> 27:51.361
If I'd known there would be
government agents

27:51.521 --> 27:53.694
showing up every other day
to ask me about her,

27:53.857 --> 27:54.927
I would've taken notes.

27:56.726 --> 28:00.765
Hey, so listen.
All this stuff about October 19th,

28:00.930 --> 28:02.534
you guys think it's serious?

28:03.767 --> 28:05.644
I mean, like,
should I be getting out of town?

28:06.069 --> 28:07.349
I don't think that's the answer.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.883
As far as we know,
you're as safe here as anywhere else.

28:13.043 --> 28:16.252
That kid was lying. Or at least
he wasn't telling you everything.

28:16.413 --> 28:17.933
The whole time
you were talking to him,

28:18.081 --> 28:19.617
he was thinking about an address.

28:19.783 --> 28:21.729
331 Reynolds Avenue.

28:35.231 --> 28:38.075
Looks like it's clear. Nobody's home.

28:38.234 --> 28:40.942
Nobody's been home for a while,
I'd say.

28:42.772 --> 28:44.445
Look at this.

28:44.607 --> 28:47.554
It's the government report
on the return of the 4400.

28:47.711 --> 28:48.917
I tried to read this once.

28:49.546 --> 28:50.650
Kind of dry.

28:53.950 --> 28:57.420
It looks like someone made it
right through to the end.

29:01.524 --> 29:03.504
"Wesley Hauser."

29:06.162 --> 29:10.235
- "Wesley Hauser. Wesley Hauser."
- Who the hell is Wesley Hauser?

29:10.467 --> 29:14.438
Hauser was a Marine.
Did two tours of duty in Vietnam.

29:14.604 --> 29:17.847
He led protests against the war
after he got home in '72.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.111
Disappeared in '75.

29:19.275 --> 29:21.475
Once he got out of quarantine,
he never checked back in.

29:21.578 --> 29:23.683
Guy's been living off the grid
for almost two years.

29:23.847 --> 29:25.793
Which means he never went
on the inhibitor.

29:25.949 --> 29:27.929
So who knows
what he's capable of by now.

29:28.084 --> 29:30.564
He was disillusioned with the
government before he disappeared.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.400
I wouldn't say we've done much
to win him over since he's been back.

29:33.456 --> 29:35.776
When he was in quarantine,
he was housed in barracks three,

29:35.925 --> 29:37.461
same building as T.J. Kim.

29:37.861 --> 29:40.467
An agitator. An organizer. A radical.

29:40.630 --> 29:42.830
Sounds like we have our
second member of the Nova Group.

29:45.635 --> 29:47.114
Baldwin.

29:48.805 --> 29:49.943
You're kidding me.

29:50.206 --> 29:52.049
All right. All right. I know.
Put him through.

29:52.475 --> 29:55.513
- He says he's Wesley Hauser.
- No way.

29:58.615 --> 29:59.889
Yeah, hello?

30:00.049 --> 30:01.722
<i>How'd you like my apartment?</i>

30:01.885 --> 30:04.285
Well, to be honest, it felt a little empty
without you there.

30:04.354 --> 30:07.267
<i>I'm on a tight schedule.
A lot to do before next week.</i>

30:07.423 --> 30:10.423
Sounds like you have interesting plans.
Why don't we get together someplace,

30:10.460 --> 30:12.736
- talk them over?
<i>- No more talking.</i>

30:12.896 --> 30:16.207
<i>There's nothing to say.
Your time is ending.</i>

30:16.366 --> 30:18.209
<i>Ours begins October 19th.</i>

30:25.275 --> 30:26.276
Come on. Let me go.

30:27.610 --> 30:29.370
Why'd you run
when we asked you about Hauser?

30:30.079 --> 30:31.759
You two used to eat together
in quarantine.

30:31.881 --> 30:33.758
- We've got it on camera.
- So...?

30:33.917 --> 30:35.397
The guy had a lot
of good war stories.

30:35.552 --> 30:37.632
- Doesn't make us best friends.
- So why did you run?

30:37.720 --> 30:40.132
Because when I see NTAC agents,
I run the other way.

30:40.290 --> 30:44.170
You people almost killed us all.
Can you blame me?

30:46.729 --> 30:49.005
Turn around. Turn around.

30:53.369 --> 30:56.316
- Are we done here?
- Get out of here.

30:58.575 --> 31:00.555
I mean, call me sensitive,

31:00.944 --> 31:03.948
but I felt like saying to him,
"We exposed the inhibitor.

31:04.113 --> 31:06.389
We saved your life."

31:09.919 --> 31:12.627
You guys just don't really get it,
do you?

31:12.789 --> 31:14.393
It's not just that guy.

31:14.557 --> 31:17.697
Every 4400 we've talked to today,
they're scared of you.

31:18.061 --> 31:19.938
Or they don't trust you.
Or they hate you.

31:20.363 --> 31:22.138
I'm sorry, but the days
when you could expect

31:22.298 --> 31:24.904
friendly conversation
from these people, they're gone.

31:25.368 --> 31:27.439
You're the bad guys now.

31:27.937 --> 31:29.746
Get used to it.

31:40.783 --> 31:42.823
Now, I'm just warning you,
motherhood's no cakewalk.

31:42.952 --> 31:45.023
Since when are you an expert?

31:45.188 --> 31:49.193
I'm only saying she landed on twins.
Kind of a big responsibility.

31:49.359 --> 31:51.862
Especially when she's trying to get by
on a teacher's salary.

31:52.028 --> 31:55.168
- What are you gonna name them?
- I don't really want to play anymore.

31:55.331 --> 31:57.937
- Is that okay?
- Oh, what's wrong, sweetheart?

31:58.301 --> 32:00.941
Nothing,
except I know Marco's gonna win,

32:01.104 --> 32:04.711
I'm gonna come second, and you're
gonna end up alone with no money.

32:10.647 --> 32:11.648
Don't be jealous.

32:11.814 --> 32:14.988
He is smarter than you,
but Mom likes you better.

32:20.423 --> 32:22.460
So who's smarter than me?

32:22.926 --> 32:24.701
Who knows?

32:25.361 --> 32:27.841
I'm not even sure
she knows exactly.

32:27.997 --> 32:30.278
In some ways she was better off
on the promicin inhibitor.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.539
At least she wasn't overwhelmed
back then.

32:33.036 --> 32:36.984
All she wants to do is record
what she sees in those notebooks.

32:37.540 --> 32:40.680
It's like some kind of compulsion.

32:42.278 --> 32:45.851
Well, think about it for a minute.

32:46.082 --> 32:50.053
Every morning she wakes up
and knows pretty much what's coming.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.764
She's already lived the whole day
once in her head.

32:52.922 --> 32:54.993
By the time
something actually does happen,

32:55.158 --> 32:56.159
it's like a rerun.

32:56.326 --> 33:00.468
- I hate watching reruns.
- Yeah, try living one.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.076
Hey, what about Kevin Burkhoff?

33:03.800 --> 33:06.542
Maybe he can figure out a way
for Maia to control her visions.

33:06.903 --> 33:10.214
- He's brilliant.
- I don't say this about many people,

33:10.373 --> 33:12.319
but he is smarter than me.

33:17.347 --> 33:18.348
I know you.

33:18.514 --> 33:21.654
- Of course you do. It's Diana Skouris.
- You work at NTAC.

33:21.818 --> 33:25.561
I'm not here on business, though.
I'm here about my daughter, Maia.

33:25.955 --> 33:28.663
The precog. What about her?

33:28.825 --> 33:31.396
She's still 10, right?
She's not 65 now, is she?

33:31.928 --> 33:33.874
Interesting guess.

33:34.030 --> 33:37.034
- Kind of wide of the mark, though.
- Good.

33:42.939 --> 33:44.976
Might as well come on in.

33:45.575 --> 33:47.350
Thank you.

33:49.479 --> 33:51.959
- Oh, sorry about the clutter.
- That's okay.

33:52.115 --> 33:55.722
I fired the maid last week.
She was always cleaning.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.065
Excuse me.

34:06.262 --> 34:10.233
So your daughter,

34:11.801 --> 34:12.802
what's troubling her?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.809
I'll let you do it.

35:20.470 --> 35:22.040
I caused all this, right?

35:22.572 --> 35:24.813
And getting rid of me is the only way
to save my mother.

35:24.974 --> 35:25.975
No.

35:26.142 --> 35:28.053
That's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?

35:28.277 --> 35:29.585
No, it wasn't.

35:29.745 --> 35:31.122
I don't want her to die either.

35:31.280 --> 35:34.193
So I'll let you do it.
I'll even shut my eyes.

35:34.884 --> 35:38.855
Isabelle, I would never hurt you.

35:39.822 --> 35:41.358
Why?

35:42.325 --> 35:44.285
I don't understand.
It's the only way to save her.

35:44.360 --> 35:45.361
We don't know that.

35:45.528 --> 35:47.633
And I won't make a choice
between the two of you.

35:48.397 --> 35:49.808
Won't or can't?

36:03.913 --> 36:06.917
Sorry. I don't mean
to invade anyone's space.

36:07.083 --> 36:10.428
Oh, that's okay. It's not my desk.

36:10.887 --> 36:13.527
But it looks like you'll be here
for a while now, huh?

36:13.689 --> 36:16.101
Assuming this place is still standing
on October 20th, yeah.

36:16.259 --> 36:20.230
Maybe we should talk to Jarvis.
Get you a room of your very own.

36:20.396 --> 36:21.500
That's fine with me.

36:23.032 --> 36:25.911
To tell you the truth,
I could use a little bit of a buffer zone.

36:28.004 --> 36:32.680
This problem you're having
with your daughter's precog ability.

36:33.843 --> 36:36.380
I keep wanting to give you
my opinion.

36:36.546 --> 36:37.957
But I don't want to intrude.

36:38.114 --> 36:41.687
So you are listening to my thoughts.

36:42.051 --> 36:45.498
You and Baldwin. I can't help it.

36:45.755 --> 36:46.835
I try to tune you guys out,

36:46.956 --> 36:49.436
but every now and then
something leaks through.

36:49.959 --> 36:52.337
I'll try to keep that in mind.

36:55.831 --> 36:59.278
You said you had an opinion
about Maia. What is it?

36:59.802 --> 37:03.978
When I first developed
this thing of mine,

37:04.307 --> 37:06.651
I was a basket case. You saw me.

37:06.809 --> 37:09.255
I truly thought I was going insane.

37:09.478 --> 37:12.152
So I fought against it.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.392
And that just made it worse.

37:14.550 --> 37:17.827
I had to give in to it,
let it take control of me.

37:18.454 --> 37:22.994
And then slowly,
I learned how to take control of it.

37:23.559 --> 37:24.902
Listen, your kid stops fighting,

37:25.061 --> 37:30.443
and eventually it'll become like seeing,
or hearing, or any other sense.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.307
She won't even think about it.

37:33.336 --> 37:35.816
It's just a part of who she is.

37:39.542 --> 37:41.647
That's how it worked for me,
anyway.

37:45.248 --> 37:46.693
Thank you.

37:47.283 --> 37:49.083
Diana, we just got a call
from Seattle police.

37:49.185 --> 37:53.031
Someone down there read our APB.
They know exactly where Hauser is.

37:56.292 --> 37:59.136
You guys are lucky, actually.
In another day or two,

37:59.295 --> 38:01.366
we would've buried him
in the potter's field.

38:01.530 --> 38:03.942
- Buried who?
- Him.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.477
I always read the APB memos

38:05.635 --> 38:08.047
when they circulate
in the police department.

38:08.204 --> 38:09.808
Kind of a hobby.

38:09.972 --> 38:11.349
Gets boring in here.

38:11.841 --> 38:14.151
Anyway, there was a description
of a regimental tattoo

38:14.310 --> 38:15.380
on the memo for Hauser.

38:15.544 --> 38:18.115
82nd Airborne.
"Death From Above."

38:18.281 --> 38:20.921
I remember it from a John Doe
they brought in here three weeks ago.

38:21.350 --> 38:22.727
This guy drowned in the harbor.

38:22.885 --> 38:25.195
Well, a lot of veterans
have that tattoo.

38:25.354 --> 38:28.528
Do a lot of veterans look exactly
like the mug shot you circulated?

38:29.659 --> 38:32.071
Don't believe me?
Take a look for yourselves.

38:35.064 --> 38:37.874
Say hello to Wesley Hauser.

38:44.073 --> 38:46.451
Hauser died two and a half weeks
before Ryland was attacked.

38:46.609 --> 38:48.729
Obviously, that wasn't him
on the phone the other day.

38:48.778 --> 38:52.555
And that copy of the 4400 report
with all his notes over it?

38:52.715 --> 38:55.218
For all we know,
that could've been a plant.

38:55.384 --> 38:56.692
Somebody wanted us distracted.

38:56.852 --> 38:58.332
They deliberately put us on the trail

38:58.421 --> 39:00.367
of some phantom member
of the Nova Group.

39:00.523 --> 39:02.043
How did we first find out
about Hauser?

39:02.191 --> 39:04.193
T.J.'s old boyfriend
gave us the address.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.930
No, he was thinking it.

39:07.763 --> 39:09.208
At least according to Gary he was.

39:09.365 --> 39:11.902
Gary Navarro put us
on to Wesley Hauser.

39:34.123 --> 39:35.124
Get in.

39:41.931 --> 39:43.968
You lied to me, Daniel.

39:44.133 --> 39:46.238
You never said anything
about killing people.

39:46.402 --> 39:48.541
No, we were protecting you, Shawn.

39:48.704 --> 39:51.947
If we tell you in advance,
you're culpable.

39:57.046 --> 39:59.720
- What is she doing here?
- She's dying. She needs your help.

39:59.882 --> 40:02.988
I told you, I don't want anything more
to do with you.

40:03.152 --> 40:04.792
The Nova Group
was supposed to protect us.

40:04.954 --> 40:06.695
That's why I gave you money,
Daniel.

40:06.856 --> 40:09.837
That's why I gave you money.
Not to start a terrorist organization!

40:09.992 --> 40:11.472
We'll talk about your concerns later.

40:11.594 --> 40:13.369
She's got a stomach wound
and it's infected.

40:13.529 --> 40:16.271
She needs you right now
or she's not gonna make it.

40:16.432 --> 40:19.379
Shawn, she's a 4400.

40:19.535 --> 40:22.607
And if we don't help each other,
what hope do we have?

40:27.076 --> 40:28.885
Give me your hand.

41:55.831 --> 41:57.208
What are you doing here?

41:58.501 --> 42:01.141
You're awake. Good.

42:03.072 --> 42:05.552
It's important
that you know it was me.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.860
I'm the guy who killed you.

42:36.438 --> 42:38.941
<i>Med post, do you have a 20
on Gary Navarro?</i>

42:39.475 --> 42:43.218
- Yeah, he just walked by. Why?
- Get him.

42:43.379 --> 42:44.824
Hey. Stop!

42:44.980 --> 42:46.891
Go. <i>I'll</i> check on Ryland.

42:48.517 --> 42:50.724
He's seizing. He's bradying down.

42:50.886 --> 42:54.993
I need a crash cart and Ativan.
Find Dr. Danoff. Now!

43:02.531 --> 43:05.011
Stay right there, Gary.

43:10.372 --> 43:11.646
Isabelle.

43:11.807 --> 43:14.481
Isabelle. Oh, God!

43:14.643 --> 43:16.179
Somebody call an ambulance!

43:17.680 --> 43:19.120
What's everybody
standing around for?

43:19.214 --> 43:22.525
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- They're on their way.

43:26.989 --> 43:28.696
- Somebody ll an ambulance.
- Dad.

43:44.106 --> 43:46.347
What am I?

43:48.077 --> 43:49.613
<i>It's miraculous, Shawn.</i>

43:51.080 --> 43:53.617
When I watch you heal someone,

43:53.782 --> 43:56.786
well, it makes me wonder
why they hate us so much.

43:57.319 --> 43:59.925
They hate us
because you're killing them, Daniel.

44:00.089 --> 44:02.797
They're afraid of us.
I can't blame them.

44:03.692 --> 44:08.072
You make it sound like we acted out
of some sort of blood lust.

44:08.864 --> 44:12.209
These were precise,
tactical strikes, Shawn.

44:12.368 --> 44:14.177
And you and every other 4400

44:14.336 --> 44:16.077
were ultimately much safer
because of them.

44:16.238 --> 44:17.546
You killed people.

44:17.706 --> 44:20.346
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.

44:20.509 --> 44:22.749
I gave you money to start
a defensive arm for the Center,

44:22.811 --> 44:24.691
in case the government
ever came after us again.

44:24.813 --> 44:25.883
It was a precaution.

44:26.048 --> 44:28.085
And all we've done
is taken precautionary measures.

44:28.250 --> 44:31.094
Shawn, do you think that because
their inhibitor program was exposed,

44:31.253 --> 44:33.859
that the government's just gonna
leave us in peace?

44:34.023 --> 44:36.867
They know we've gotten stronger,
which threatens their hold on power,

44:37.026 --> 44:38.706
which increases their need
to eliminate us.

44:38.827 --> 44:41.068
So we strike first?

44:41.764 --> 44:43.835
Is that it?

44:44.533 --> 44:46.103
Is that what happens on the 19th?

44:46.468 --> 44:48.311
Look, Shawn.

44:49.038 --> 44:50.949
You do great work
at that center of yours.

44:51.507 --> 44:53.282
You just focus on that.

44:53.442 --> 44:55.854
I don't wanna distract you.
Knowledge can be a burden.

44:59.114 --> 45:00.923
And thanks for helping T.J. out.

45:01.517 --> 45:03.463
You're a hero to your own people.

45:03.619 --> 45:05.565
Don't forget that.

45:08.857 --> 45:10.336
Yeah.

45:13.729 --> 45:15.367
It did not work, you know.

45:15.531 --> 45:18.774
Ryland was OD'ing,
but the doctors pulled him out of it.

45:18.934 --> 45:20.811
He'll be awake
within a couple of hours.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.949
Well, I'm sure
you're as disappointed as I am.

45:24.139 --> 45:26.085
Don't worry, we'll get him.

45:26.341 --> 45:30.380
Let's talk about Wesley Hauser.
You first met him in quarantine.

45:31.213 --> 45:32.248
I liked Wes.

45:32.414 --> 45:35.486
He was ten kinds of crazy,
but his heart was in the right place.

45:35.651 --> 45:39.030
I guess he was bipolar or something,
but he never took medication.

45:39.188 --> 45:41.395
After quarantine,
he lived on the streets.

45:42.391 --> 45:44.098
I used to visit him
down at the docks.

45:44.259 --> 45:45.966
You know, give him food,
a little money.

45:46.128 --> 45:47.801
So when did you decide to kill him?

45:47.963 --> 45:51.240
Wes, he didn't need
my help with that.

45:51.400 --> 45:53.676
He drank about three bottles
of Mad Dog a day.

45:54.136 --> 45:58.551
One morning, about a month ago,
I went down to see him,

45:59.742 --> 46:02.985
and I found him by the dumpster,
dead.

46:03.145 --> 46:05.225
And somewhere in the middle
of your grieving process,

46:05.314 --> 46:06.714
you figured
he'd make a handy decoy.

46:06.815 --> 46:08.419
No, Hauser wouldn't have minded it.

46:08.584 --> 46:11.690
I mean, he hated people like you
going back to his Marine Corps days.

46:12.054 --> 46:15.968
So when I found him,
I said a word or two over his body.

46:17.659 --> 46:19.332
And I pushed him into Elliot Bay.

46:19.495 --> 46:21.634
So how long you been working
with this Nova Group?

46:21.797 --> 46:23.997
Did someone approach you?
Was the whole thing your idea?

46:24.066 --> 46:27.445
Tell me.
You and this girlfriend of yours.

46:27.603 --> 46:30.516
Is it like a role-playing thing
you get up to,

46:30.672 --> 46:32.392
Or is she actually taking you
into these...?

46:33.208 --> 46:35.711
I don't know. What do you call it?
Fantasy worlds?

46:37.479 --> 46:39.186
Oh, and this guy, Marco.

46:40.349 --> 46:43.796
Does he know that you're too

46:43.952 --> 46:47.195
embarrassed to tell your partner
that you two have been dating?

46:48.690 --> 46:50.033
Done showing off?

46:50.959 --> 46:53.735
Why don't you tell us what's
gonna happen on October 19th?

46:54.029 --> 46:56.873
I guess you're gonna have
to find yourself another telepath.

47:02.805 --> 47:04.546
Good luck with that.

47:05.407 --> 47:07.819
- So you got nothing out of him?
- He told us about Hauser.

47:07.976 --> 47:10.656
But as far as the Nova goes,
it's gonna take time to break him down.

47:10.746 --> 47:12.419
- How much time?
- He's a telepath.

47:12.581 --> 47:14.686
- He knows what we're thinking.
- Longer than usual.

47:14.850 --> 47:15.920
Okay, so it's not easy.

47:16.084 --> 47:18.894
But Gary Navarro
has a Level 7 security clearance.

47:19.054 --> 47:20.374
We must assume he's been using it

47:20.455 --> 47:22.230
to funnel national secrets
to the Nova Group.

47:22.391 --> 47:24.769
We need to know what he knows.
Now.

47:24.927 --> 47:26.497
He'll talk.

47:26.662 --> 47:28.182
Garys been inside our heads
for a year.

47:28.297 --> 47:30.174
I think I know
how to get inside of his.

47:34.770 --> 47:37.842
- Careful with this, please.
- Matthew.

47:39.575 --> 47:41.748
I didn't expect to see you back
for a couple weeks.

47:41.910 --> 47:44.686
Nova Group provides
my calendar for me.

47:44.847 --> 47:47.157
Wiped it clean, actually.

47:47.316 --> 47:49.159
It's difficult to lobby
on behalf of the 4400

47:49.318 --> 47:51.491
when some of them are boasting
about their body count.

47:51.653 --> 47:53.132
I suppose.

47:53.288 --> 47:55.393
Hows Lily?
Any improvement since I left?

47:55.557 --> 47:59.027
- If anything, she's getting worse.
- Sorry to hear that.

47:59.194 --> 48:00.639
Isabelle?

48:00.796 --> 48:03.436
She tried to kill herself
this morning.

48:04.366 --> 48:06.676
She jumped off the roof.

48:06.835 --> 48:09.748
A few minutes later, she was walking
around like nothing happened.

48:09.905 --> 48:10.945
I gotta tell you, Matthew.

48:11.073 --> 48:14.111
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm really glad you're back.

48:37.132 --> 48:38.907
Hello, Isabelle.

48:40.435 --> 48:42.346
Hello. Who are you?

48:43.372 --> 48:47.286
My name is Matthew Ross.
I work closely with Shawn.

48:47.643 --> 48:51.682
I'm an adviser to the 4400.
May I come in?

49:00.188 --> 49:03.192
I understand
there was an incident this morning.

49:04.026 --> 49:07.166
You attempted to harm yourself.

49:09.765 --> 49:11.403
I see.

49:14.136 --> 49:16.138
You had no right to do that!

49:16.305 --> 49:18.148
Don't you understand who you are?

49:18.307 --> 49:20.480
What you're here to do?

49:20.642 --> 49:22.622
- No.
- Well, I do.

49:22.778 --> 49:24.818
I know everything about you.
I know why you're here,

49:24.880 --> 49:27.053
and I know
what you're supposed to do.

49:28.283 --> 49:29.660
Sit.

49:29.818 --> 49:31.991
And I'll tell you a story.

49:32.955 --> 49:34.332
You'll like it.

49:34.489 --> 49:37.299
It's about your past
and it's about your future.

49:46.635 --> 49:49.013
I know you went
to a lot of trouble to get this.

49:49.171 --> 49:51.048
- Thank you.
- But...?

49:51.206 --> 49:52.846
I'm not sure
I wanna send Maia to a school

49:52.941 --> 49:55.148
that only teaches 4400s.

49:55.310 --> 49:59.452
It sounds like a great way to get her to
withdraw even further from the world.

49:59.614 --> 50:03.892
Just pretend it's got nothing to do
with the 4400 for a second.

50:04.052 --> 50:06.328
It's a good school.
You know, topnotch faculty.

50:06.488 --> 50:09.059
The facilities are great.
And it's all free.

50:09.224 --> 50:11.932
The 4400 Center picks up
the whole tab.

50:12.094 --> 50:14.597
They even have a class
on how to manage your abilities.

50:14.963 --> 50:17.705
Just give me some time
to think about it, okay? It's a big step.

50:19.801 --> 50:21.712
I was kind of hoping
Dr. Burkhoff would have,

50:21.870 --> 50:24.612
I don't know,
a magic pill or something.

50:24.773 --> 50:28.516
What's he working on?
Anything interesting?

50:28.677 --> 50:33.148
You know that promicin serum
that he invented that saved everybody?

50:33.315 --> 50:37.764
Well, I saw a syringe at his place,
and it looked like there was some in it.

50:37.919 --> 50:39.455
Well, he's a researcher, right?

50:39.621 --> 50:42.431
He's probably injecting into, what?
Mice? Guinea pigs?

50:42.591 --> 50:45.231
The only animals I saw at his place
were a couple of cockroaches.

50:45.394 --> 50:48.238
You don't think he's injecting it
into himself, do you?

50:49.031 --> 50:50.476
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

50:50.632 --> 50:53.545
I am not injecting myself
with the promicin serum.

50:53.702 --> 50:55.943
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

50:56.104 --> 50:57.742
I'm injecting myself

50:57.906 --> 51:01.854
with a modified version
of the promicin serum.

51:02.010 --> 51:04.854
Dr. Burkhoff, I have to ask you this:

51:05.747 --> 51:07.317
Have you stopped taking
your medication?

51:07.482 --> 51:10.827
Of course not.
I'm as sane as you are.

51:12.754 --> 51:15.894
Once the course of treatment
is finished,

51:16.058 --> 51:19.505
I will have taught my body
how to produce promicin.

51:19.661 --> 51:21.902
And then I will be the first

51:22.064 --> 51:25.204
non-returnee
to develop 4400 abilities.

51:25.367 --> 51:27.745
The first of many.

51:27.903 --> 51:31.112
You're talking about the next step
in human evolution.

51:31.273 --> 51:32.843
Do you think
the world's ready for that?

51:33.008 --> 51:35.608
The world is never ready for change.
You have to force it on them.

51:35.677 --> 51:38.590
Isn't that why the 4400
were brought back?

51:38.747 --> 51:41.956
Isn't that why the future
woke me up?

51:43.385 --> 51:47.026
You shouldn't be doing research
of this magnitude

51:47.189 --> 51:49.863
in, excuse me, but... In a dump.

51:50.025 --> 51:53.006
These are hardly sterile
working conditions.

51:53.161 --> 51:54.663
You could help me with that.

51:54.830 --> 51:56.707
You have a scientific background,
right?

51:56.865 --> 51:59.846
I have graduate degrees
in microbiology and epidemiology.

52:00.001 --> 52:02.982
Good. That'll be handy.

52:03.138 --> 52:06.017
I need someone
to monitor my progress

52:06.174 --> 52:09.314
as the changes continue.

52:10.979 --> 52:12.720
Changes?

52:18.720 --> 52:22.361
I think it's an exciting first step,
don't you?

52:25.527 --> 52:27.473
I was thinking, next time,
we could make a world

52:27.629 --> 52:30.803
where Kyle never shot Jordan Collier,
never went to prison,

52:31.233 --> 52:33.804
the inhibitor scandal
never happened.

52:33.969 --> 52:35.676
Sounds nice.

52:35.837 --> 52:37.517
Although I have to tell you,
at the moment,

52:37.606 --> 52:39.446
I'm not really feeling a need
to be transported

52:39.508 --> 52:41.852
to some kind of fantasy world.

52:42.010 --> 52:43.290
As long as this water stays hot,

52:43.411 --> 52:47.951
things are A-okay with me
right here and now.

52:48.550 --> 52:51.121
Maybe tomorrow we can try it again.

52:51.286 --> 52:52.287
I'll take a rain check.

52:52.454 --> 52:56.994
I'm going to a seminar
at the 4400 Center tomorrow.

52:59.127 --> 53:00.970
It's about what
we can expect physically

53:01.129 --> 53:02.506
now that we're off the inhibitor.

53:02.664 --> 53:05.645
Is everything okay? You're not
having any problems, are you?

53:05.800 --> 53:09.543
No, I feel fine. I feel great, actually.

53:10.839 --> 53:13.718
Well, then I don't get it.
Why do you need to go?

53:13.875 --> 53:17.914
I don't. I wanna go. I'm curious.

53:18.079 --> 53:21.060
But why? You never wanted
to go to the Center before.

53:21.216 --> 53:22.752
Why start now?

53:22.918 --> 53:27.628
I never felt the need
to be around other 4400s before.

53:27.789 --> 53:29.860
Now you do?

53:30.025 --> 53:33.165
It's just a seminar, Thomas.

53:34.296 --> 53:35.639
Yeah, okay.

53:37.199 --> 53:38.735
I get it.

53:46.808 --> 53:48.446
Do you recognize those names?

53:48.877 --> 53:51.756
They're 4400s.
All of them foreign nationals.

53:51.913 --> 53:53.790
Alesandro Ortiz from Venezuela.

53:53.949 --> 53:56.930
Ismael Namir from Libya.
Chitra Singh from Indonesia.

53:57.085 --> 53:58.928
They've all gone missing
in the past year.

53:59.087 --> 54:00.725
That's one year.

54:00.889 --> 54:03.665
That's about as long as you've worked
for the NSA, isn't it, Gary?

54:04.059 --> 54:05.561
We checked your travel records.

54:05.727 --> 54:09.038
You left Venezuela two days
before Ortiz disappeared.

54:09.197 --> 54:12.337
Same thing in Libya, Indonesia.
Everyone on that list.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.911
You were there. They went away.

54:14.069 --> 54:17.573
What exactly did you do
for the NSA, Gary?

54:18.139 --> 54:19.819
There's an arms race going on,
isn't there?

54:19.941 --> 54:21.545
Only now it's with 4400s.

54:21.710 --> 54:24.589
These people, I bet their abilities
make the wrong people very nervous.

54:24.746 --> 54:25.906
And the NSA couldn't stand by

54:26.047 --> 54:30.496
while foreign and potentially
hostile governments developed what?

54:30.652 --> 54:32.632
Human weapons
of mass destruction?

54:33.054 --> 54:34.556
Is this list complete, huh?

54:34.723 --> 54:37.033
Because I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.

54:37.192 --> 54:40.036
- I did not kill anyone.
- Oh, no, no, no.

54:40.195 --> 54:41.995
You got the right people
in the right ZIP code

54:42.097 --> 54:43.599
because you were living back home.

54:44.566 --> 54:46.102
What did you say? Oh, yeah.

54:46.268 --> 54:49.841
'Very comfortably
when the actual dirty work was done."

54:51.406 --> 54:55.115
And that's why you went across
to the Nova Group, isn't it, Gary?

54:55.277 --> 54:57.621
Because you just couldn't live
with yourself.

54:58.380 --> 55:03.853
The NSA told me
that I was helping my country.

55:07.289 --> 55:09.792
They didn't fill in the blanks.

55:11.159 --> 55:13.230
I had to do that myself.

55:13.561 --> 55:15.097
You felt used.

55:15.263 --> 55:17.209
They made you a weapon
against your own people.

55:17.365 --> 55:19.743
So when did you figure it out?

55:20.402 --> 55:22.404
What's up? Who are these guys?

55:22.570 --> 55:25.312
This is Agent Wood
and Dr. Boll of the NSA.

55:25.473 --> 55:28.682
They've been brought in
to help expedite the interrogation.

55:30.278 --> 55:32.815
First of all, no more sitting.

55:32.981 --> 55:34.221
What's going on here?

55:34.382 --> 55:37.386
- Brought in by whom?
- Gary Navarro tried to kill me.

55:37.552 --> 55:38.826
I made a phone call.

55:38.987 --> 55:40.547
You should be in jail right now,
Dennis.

55:40.622 --> 55:43.831
- I still have a few friends, Tom.
- I had him talking.

55:43.992 --> 55:46.996
- I was making progress.
- Not fast enough.

55:47.162 --> 55:49.904
The members of Gary's cell
know he's been taken.

55:50.065 --> 55:52.568
They're already changing
their plans.

55:52.734 --> 55:56.841
If it takes too long to break him,
the information he gives us is stale.

55:57.005 --> 56:00.214
- October 19th is three days away.
-  Yeah.

56:00.375 --> 56:03.117
I know you find this
hard to believe, Tom,

56:03.278 --> 56:05.656
but we are on the same side.

56:05.814 --> 56:08.294
We have the same goal.

56:08.450 --> 56:11.158
Those agents are tools.

56:11.986 --> 56:13.590
Use them.

56:23.531 --> 56:26.034
You're sitting in my spot.

56:26.201 --> 56:27.509
Sorry.

56:27.669 --> 56:31.242
It's okay.
There's room for two people to sit.

56:37.712 --> 56:41.683
You've got Stalin, Pol Pot
and the Marquis de Sade?

56:41.850 --> 56:43.170
Did you finish all the fun books?

56:43.818 --> 56:45.798
Well, I'm interested
in learning more about evil.

56:45.954 --> 56:49.492
Everybody's scared of me.
So I thought, what if they're right?

56:50.425 --> 56:53.895
- What if I'm bad?
- Why would you think that?

56:54.729 --> 56:57.505
Sometimes, I think
I feel it inside of me,

56:57.665 --> 56:59.145
like, I could be capable of anything.

57:00.201 --> 57:02.772
Everyone's capable of anything.

57:02.937 --> 57:05.008
- Believe me, I know.
- How?

57:05.507 --> 57:08.613
- Have you done bad things?
- Yeah, of course I have.

57:08.777 --> 57:09.983
Will you tell me about them?

57:12.180 --> 57:13.682
Okay.

57:14.849 --> 57:17.830
- I slept with my brother's girlfriend.
- How bad is that?

57:17.986 --> 57:21.024
Some people would call that
a major betrayal.

57:21.189 --> 57:22.463
A lot of hurt feelings.

57:24.025 --> 57:27.905
- This man did much worse than that.
- Well, I'm not a dictator.

57:28.062 --> 57:31.339
But I've done the big kind of bad too.

57:31.499 --> 57:32.539
I can't say much about it,

57:32.667 --> 57:35.341
but I gave some money
to some people.

57:35.503 --> 57:37.676
They used it for something
really, really wrong.

57:37.839 --> 57:40.376
And I don't think
that they're finished.

57:40.809 --> 57:43.187
- Well, can you stop them?
- I could turn them in.

57:43.344 --> 57:45.722
The thing is, so far, they've
only gone after bad people.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.417
- People that tried to kill me.
- Tried to kill all of us.

57:48.583 --> 57:50.324
So if they've only gone
after bad people,

57:50.485 --> 57:54.456
- then doesn't that make them good?
- Maybe.

57:55.056 --> 57:56.729
I don't know.

58:06.835 --> 58:09.372
We're relating now, aren't we?

58:09.537 --> 58:11.175
I read about this.

58:13.208 --> 58:15.814
Yeah, we are.

58:20.181 --> 58:22.058
How was it for you?

58:22.550 --> 58:24.461
I liked it.

58:25.687 --> 58:27.997
We talked.

58:28.156 --> 58:29.658
It helped me understand
good and evil.

58:30.225 --> 58:32.796
According to you, you get to pick.

58:32.961 --> 58:34.167
It's a choice.

58:35.630 --> 58:37.268
I have it right, don't I?

58:41.269 --> 58:42.771
Yeah, you do.

58:50.912 --> 58:52.550
I can't open my hand.

58:52.714 --> 58:56.389
I woke up from a nap,
and it was all bunched up like this.

58:56.551 --> 58:57.859
Arthritis, I can handle.

59:17.138 --> 59:18.139
Feels good.

59:27.749 --> 59:30.559
You're like a human heating pad.

59:32.053 --> 59:33.430
I like that.

59:33.588 --> 59:36.501
Human heating pad.
I'll take it as a compliment.

59:36.658 --> 59:39.161
Seriously, you better?

59:39.327 --> 59:40.772
Yeah.

59:45.567 --> 59:46.602
I've been trading e-mails

59:46.768 --> 59:48.770
with somebody
down at the Mayo Clinic.

59:48.937 --> 59:52.908
He says we should go to Sweden
and try this experimental treatment.

59:53.641 --> 59:55.086
Here.

59:55.810 --> 59:57.255
What's this?

59:57.712 --> 59:59.248
Open it.

01:00:07.388 --> 01:00:10.858
Can you believe that the Air Force
lets you do that now?

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.730
You give them some money,
and they let you ride along in an F-16.

01:00:15.897 --> 01:00:17.638
It says here
I get to take the controls.

01:00:17.799 --> 01:00:19.839
I talked to the guy
who was in charge of the program

01:00:19.901 --> 01:00:22.211
and I told him about
your background as a pilot,

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:26.819
and he said he would let you drive
for 30 seconds.

01:00:26.975 --> 01:00:29.046
Lily, I was a pilot in 1950.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.350
That's why it's only 30 seconds.

01:00:33.314 --> 01:00:35.453
Happy birthday, Richard.

01:00:35.617 --> 01:00:37.824
Thanks, but it's not my birthday
for another six weeks.

01:00:40.054 --> 01:00:42.796
Richard, I'm not going to be here
in six weeks.

01:00:44.859 --> 01:00:47.806
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:00:47.962 --> 01:00:50.408
You and I have both known
for a while.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.911
Richard, I'm dying.

01:00:55.136 --> 01:00:56.615
Lily.

01:00:56.771 --> 01:01:00.617
I know how hard this is on you,
but you can't give up.

01:01:00.775 --> 01:01:03.415
Shawn said he's willing to stay
here with you all day if he has to.

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:06.915
- He'll keep you healthy.
- He can't.

01:01:08.216 --> 01:01:10.025
Not anymore.

01:01:23.164 --> 01:01:25.371
Are all these people 4400s?

01:01:25.533 --> 01:01:28.139
Some are.
Some just wish they were.

01:01:28.302 --> 01:01:30.248
Why would they want that?

01:01:31.639 --> 01:01:33.710
Good morning.
Welcome to the Center.

01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:35.013
Are you a 4400?

01:01:35.777 --> 01:01:38.485
No, sweetie. Are you?

01:01:40.281 --> 01:01:41.919
Well, it is an honor to meet you.

01:01:42.383 --> 01:01:45.523
- Are you here to take our seminar?
- No. We're here to look at the school.

01:01:45.687 --> 01:01:47.598
We have an appointment
with Ms. Tobey.

01:01:47.755 --> 01:01:49.564
I'll get her right away.

01:01:49.724 --> 01:01:53.069
In the meantime, would you sign in
and register your ability?

01:01:53.227 --> 01:01:56.071
We're creating a database.

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:03.376
You sure you wanna do this?

01:02:04.005 --> 01:02:06.451
I wanna meet kids like me.

01:02:08.543 --> 01:02:11.524
My name is Alana Mareva.

01:02:11.679 --> 01:02:14.751
I have to admit,

01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:18.420
I was pretty hesitant
about coming here today.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.399
I was lucky. My life was pretty much
intact when I was returned.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.505
I never thought much
about being a 4400.

01:02:30.465 --> 01:02:33.639
But when we all got sick,

01:02:33.801 --> 01:02:38.147
and seeing everyone together
in quarantine,

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.579
it made me feel like
I had been denying a part of myself.

01:02:43.745 --> 01:02:47.283
So here I am.

01:02:47.448 --> 01:02:49.450
And I'm glad I came.

01:03:03.297 --> 01:03:05.470
Anything you wanna tell me?

01:03:11.105 --> 01:03:12.482
Gary.

01:03:15.343 --> 01:03:17.414
Let's end this.

01:03:18.846 --> 01:03:21.224
I'll let you sit down.

01:03:22.116 --> 01:03:23.891
Who contacted you first?

01:03:24.685 --> 01:03:26.562
Just give me a name.

01:03:28.489 --> 01:03:31.129
Oh, man.

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:44.043
So how about it?

01:03:45.973 --> 01:03:49.216
October 19th is two days away.

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:52.318
Now, you got something
to tell me or not?

01:03:53.948 --> 01:03:55.859
Suit yourself.

01:04:00.321 --> 01:04:02.164
One of our members
has been compromised.

01:04:02.323 --> 01:04:04.200
I have to assume
he's gonna give up my name.

01:04:04.358 --> 01:04:05.428
<i>What, so you call me?</i>

01:04:05.593 --> 01:04:07.664
For all I know,
NTAC is monitoring this line.

01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:09.429
Well, we're gonna have
to go underground.

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:10.600
It's gonna cost money.

01:04:11.032 --> 01:04:12.712
You think I'm just gonna write you
a check?

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.245
<i>You can arrange it
however you want.</i>

01:04:14.402 --> 01:04:15.437
I need it tomorrow.

01:04:15.603 --> 01:04:18.413
I will see you at the usual spot,
at the usual time.

01:04:18.773 --> 01:04:22.277
We are in a war,
and we all have to do our part.

01:04:38.359 --> 01:04:41.306
Talk to me, Gary.
What do you got to say, man?

01:04:41.929 --> 01:04:43.636
Talk to me! Talk to me.

01:04:47.435 --> 01:04:49.437
I need names.

01:04:52.506 --> 01:04:54.417
Give me a name!

01:05:01.282 --> 01:05:04.752
- Talk to me, Gary.
- Daniel Armand.

01:05:04.919 --> 01:05:07.092
Daniel Armand.

01:05:08.256 --> 01:05:10.327
Daniel Armand.

01:05:12.126 --> 01:05:14.504
Okay. That's a start.

01:05:15.296 --> 01:05:17.276
- Who else?
- That's it.

01:05:17.431 --> 01:05:19.672
He was my only contact.

01:05:20.301 --> 01:05:24.613
I never met anyone else in the group.
He kept us all separate.

01:05:24.772 --> 01:05:27.446
I'm sorry. I'm just having
a hard time believing that's true.

01:05:27.608 --> 01:05:30.919
His pulse is tachy at 210.
Systolic's up to 240.

01:05:31.078 --> 01:05:33.080
- We need to lay off.
- We've only got one name.

01:05:33.247 --> 01:05:35.087
Can't put him under again.
Not for a few hours.

01:05:35.149 --> 01:05:38.995
We haven't got a few hours.
Don't worry. He's my responsibility.

01:05:39.153 --> 01:05:40.757
No. No.

01:05:40.922 --> 01:05:44.495
No, he's not. He's ours.
And he's done for the day.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:57.640
Okay, so he's back.
It's not like we weren't expecting this.

01:05:58.406 --> 01:06:00.545
No. Relax.

01:06:00.741 --> 01:06:02.743
He won't get anywhere
near Isabelle.

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:05.618
We'll find him, and we'll deal with it.

01:06:08.516 --> 01:06:09.688
You made a mistake.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:12.990
- You got the wrong person.
- I have to go. I don't think I do.

01:06:13.154 --> 01:06:15.828
Those things you told me,
those things you said I'm going to do.

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:18.334
That's not me. I have a choice.

01:06:18.526 --> 01:06:19.686
And I don't know who you are,

01:06:19.794 --> 01:06:22.034
and I don't know how you think
you know so much about me,

01:06:22.096 --> 01:06:25.009
- but you're wrong.
- Isabelle,

01:06:25.433 --> 01:06:27.504
I understand
why you're having trouble adjusting.

01:06:28.102 --> 01:06:31.345
Growing up is hard,
but don't be angry at the messenger.

01:06:31.505 --> 01:06:32.779
It's not my plan.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:38.253
I'm just here to help facilitate,
to help you reach your full potential.

01:06:38.746 --> 01:06:40.692
Think of me as a favorite uncle.

01:06:40.848 --> 01:06:43.192
No. No, I don't have any uncles.

01:06:43.384 --> 01:06:45.921
I don't have any uncles,
and I won't be a part of any plan.

01:06:46.087 --> 01:06:49.660
That's fair enough.
You can always opt out.

01:06:50.591 --> 01:06:53.731
You can even try saving
your mother if you like.

01:06:54.795 --> 01:06:55.796
How?

01:07:11.145 --> 01:07:15.025
- What is that?
- Open it.

01:07:18.886 --> 01:07:21.833
There aren't a lot of things
that'll hurt you, Isabelle.

01:07:21.989 --> 01:07:25.493
But that right there, that'll do the job.

01:07:26.127 --> 01:07:27.868
If you can't accept the fact
that your life

01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:29.940
is vastly more important
than your mother's,

01:07:30.097 --> 01:07:32.600
just give yourself that shot.
You'll be dead in minutes.

01:07:33.934 --> 01:07:35.743
And Lily? Who knows?

01:07:35.903 --> 01:07:39.043
Maybe she'll wake up
and be a young woman again.

01:07:42.009 --> 01:07:47.220
- Will it really save her?
- I don't know. It's a gamble.

01:07:47.381 --> 01:07:51.090
But if you can't live
with who you are, then don't.

01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:06.333
Sorry about that.

01:08:07.468 --> 01:08:09.539
I knew it. I knew it.

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:12.444
I knew I had a clean cup
somewhere.

01:08:12.606 --> 01:08:15.246
Now, where are the filters?

01:08:15.443 --> 01:08:18.481
- It's okay. I don't need coffee.
- I swear I just saw them.

01:08:18.645 --> 01:08:20.591
Do you mind
if I just use paper towels?

01:08:20.781 --> 01:08:24.354
- Kevin, if I do this...
- If you do it?

01:08:26.886 --> 01:08:28.093
You're already doing it.

01:08:28.856 --> 01:08:29.857
You're here, right?

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:32.765
If I monitor you
throughout this experiment,

01:08:32.926 --> 01:08:34.497
I need you to know one thing.

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:37.134
If it gets to a point
where your life is in danger,

01:08:37.298 --> 01:08:39.175
I am cutting this off.

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.540
I will not stand by
and watch you die.

01:08:42.603 --> 01:08:46.915
Well, I would hope not,
because I'm too valuable.

01:08:48.876 --> 01:08:50.947
I think this is gonna be fun.

01:08:51.112 --> 01:08:55.857
I haven't really worked with anyone
for quite some time.

01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:59.327
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:01.957
So...

01:09:03.491 --> 01:09:05.528
Wanna draw some blood?

01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:13.738
Nina.

01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:17.207
We were just downstairs. The guard
on duty said Wood signed Gary out.

01:09:17.371 --> 01:09:19.510
Gary was transferred
to an NSA-run facility.

01:09:19.673 --> 01:09:21.482
But he's a 4400.
He's our jurisdiction.

01:09:21.642 --> 01:09:24.054
And someone at the Pentagon
signed an order overriding us.

01:09:24.211 --> 01:09:25.884
Apparently.
They feel we lack experience

01:09:26.046 --> 01:09:27.457
in high-pressure interrogation.

01:09:27.648 --> 01:09:29.768
And who do you think put
that little bug in their ear?

01:09:29.817 --> 01:09:32.764
I don't know if it was Ryland or not.
But we had our shot at Navarro.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.120
Now, tomorrow is October 19th.

01:09:34.255 --> 01:09:36.394
We are a day away
from an announced terrorist attack.

01:09:36.557 --> 01:09:39.094
The NSA thinks
they can get him to talk.

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:42.571
- So where are they taking him?
- They didn't share that information.

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:45.540
This is so wrong.
This is the only place in the country

01:09:45.698 --> 01:09:48.009
that's at least somewhat equipped
to handle 4400s.

01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:50.410
Do you think
that I didn't tell him that?

01:09:50.571 --> 01:09:52.608
They weren't interested.

01:10:08.055 --> 01:10:09.864
- Isabelle.
- Hi.

01:10:10.024 --> 01:10:12.004
May I come in?

01:10:16.497 --> 01:10:17.771
Are you going somewhere?

01:10:17.932 --> 01:10:20.105
I saw Dad putting luggage
into his car.

01:10:20.267 --> 01:10:24.807
Oh, we're just gonna try another clinic,
but we will be away for a while.

01:10:24.972 --> 01:10:26.918
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

01:10:27.074 --> 01:10:29.076
No, it's all right. Thank you.

01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:32.784
Now, if there's anything that you need,
you can talk to Shawn.

01:10:32.947 --> 01:10:33.948
He's...

01:10:34.114 --> 01:10:37.220
He'll be looking out for you, okay?

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.524
And...

01:10:41.055 --> 01:10:43.467
I wanna give you this.

01:10:45.793 --> 01:10:49.741
It's my wedding band.
I inherited it from my grandmother.

01:10:50.431 --> 01:10:52.877
Her name was Lily too.

01:10:55.536 --> 01:10:58.642
You used to love to play with it
when you were a little baby.

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.486
I remember.

01:11:02.543 --> 01:11:06.252
- I used to like to bite on it.
- And my finger too.

01:11:07.615 --> 01:11:08.753
You can wear it if you want.

01:11:08.949 --> 01:11:12.624
I always knew
that I would give it to you one day.

01:11:13.654 --> 01:11:18.330
It doesn't fit me anymore,
and I'd hate to lose it.

01:11:19.893 --> 01:11:21.964
I'll keep it safe for you.

01:11:23.797 --> 01:11:25.435
I know you will.

01:11:27.601 --> 01:11:30.844
I'm sorry I have to leave so soon.

01:11:31.372 --> 01:11:33.477
I wish we had more time together.

01:11:34.041 --> 01:11:36.021
Well, when do you think
you'll be back?

01:11:36.176 --> 01:11:37.314
It's hard to say.

01:11:38.579 --> 01:11:40.616
Goodbye, Isabelle.

01:11:48.622 --> 01:11:50.329
Bye.

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:19.028
Thank you very much.
<i>I'll</i> take her from here.

01:12:19.186 --> 01:12:20.824
Thank you.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:22.828
Okay,

01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:26.371
you told her we were going over
to the hospital?

01:12:27.728 --> 01:12:31.232
- How'd it go over?
- Oh, fine.

01:12:31.398 --> 01:12:34.641
I had it easy. I got to lie.

01:12:39.573 --> 01:12:42.645
You're the one
who has to tell her the truth.

01:13:19.913 --> 01:13:21.950
What's going on?

01:13:22.249 --> 01:13:24.195
What's happening?

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.201
We'll get him.

01:13:41.368 --> 01:13:43.649
Funny, that's the exact same thing
Navarro said about you.

01:13:43.804 --> 01:13:44.976
So far, he's wrong.

01:13:45.139 --> 01:13:47.059
He never should've been moved
in the first place.

01:13:47.207 --> 01:13:49.087
- There was no reason.
- There was every reason.

01:13:49.209 --> 01:13:51.689
You're too soft, Tom.
I don't know what's happened to you.

01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:53.586
No, I had him, Dennis! You lost him.

01:13:55.115 --> 01:13:56.253
Sunset's in four hours.

01:13:56.417 --> 01:13:58.457
At this point, we can't even say
with 100% certainty

01:13:58.552 --> 01:14:00.192
that it's gonna rise again
in the morning.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.880
And the one guy
who can tell us is gone.

01:14:01.955 --> 01:14:04.834
That's a defeatist attitude.
We'll get him.

01:14:05.292 --> 01:14:08.637
Yeah, I know. You keep saying that.

01:14:19.907 --> 01:14:21.352
Hey, Shawn.

01:14:21.508 --> 01:14:23.681
- You got something for me?
- Where's Daniel?

01:14:24.244 --> 01:14:25.382
Busy. He sent me.

01:14:27.147 --> 01:14:29.957
- No, no, no. That's not how we work.
- Today it is.

01:14:31.118 --> 01:14:32.290
You can trust me.

01:14:32.453 --> 01:14:36.401
You saved my life. I owe you.

01:14:37.124 --> 01:14:41.072
Come on. Let's get this over with.
I feel a little naked standing out here.

01:14:45.966 --> 01:14:47.707
Thanks.

01:14:48.969 --> 01:14:51.575
Listen,
if there's ever anything you need-

01:14:57.377 --> 01:14:59.379
You sold us...

01:15:05.686 --> 01:15:06.766
Get in there, get in there.

01:15:11.558 --> 01:15:14.164
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:15:14.862 --> 01:15:17.062
I don't guess we'll be seeing her
in court anytime soon.

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:19.303
No, you did the right thing
by calling us, Shawn.

01:15:19.466 --> 01:15:20.604
Seriously.

01:15:21.034 --> 01:15:22.945
You're a hero.

01:15:45.826 --> 01:15:47.806
One minute to go.

01:15:49.096 --> 01:15:52.737
Just tell me one thing.
Are we as prepared as we can be?

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.880
The entire country's
on level-red terror alert.

01:15:55.035 --> 01:15:57.879
All commercial air traffic
has been suspended for the day.

01:15:58.038 --> 01:16:01.019
The National Guard
has been deployed to likely targets.

01:16:01.308 --> 01:16:03.549
"Likely targets." Kind of a broad term.

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:05.553
I wish T.J. could've narrowed
that down for us.

01:16:05.712 --> 01:16:09.683
Well, me too. But we have to keep her
sedated to inhibit her ability.

01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:13.320
She's already turned this place
into a war zone once.

01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:16.426
So now we wait.

01:16:17.124 --> 01:16:20.799
Anyone else feel like they're staring
at a doomsday clock?

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.247
Well, that's it.

01:16:35.409 --> 01:16:37.514
October 19th.

01:16:39.112 --> 01:16:41.615
Looks like the world's still here.

01:16:41.815 --> 01:16:44.022
For the moment, anyway.

01:17:01.134 --> 01:17:03.080
Oh, my God!

01:17:06.073 --> 01:17:09.179
- What? What happened?
- It's the Nova Group.

01:17:09.343 --> 01:17:11.118
<i>Certainly, "miracle"
is an imprecise term,</i>

01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:13.258
<i>but I'm not sure how else
to describe it.</i>

01:17:13.413 --> 01:17:14.414
<i>To repeat:</i>

01:17:14.581 --> 01:17:17.221
<i>I'm broadcasting live from
the Nubian Desert, north of Khartoum,</i>

01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:20.888
<i>where overnight,
a thousand-acre patch of barren sand</i>

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:24.297
<i>has somehow been transformed
into fertile wheat fields.</i>

01:17:24.458 --> 01:17:27.064
<i>Scientists are at a loss
to explain the conversion,</i>

01:17:27.227 --> 01:17:30.265
<i>but tests confirm that the wheat
is real and edible.</i>

01:17:30.464 --> 01:17:32.664
There hasn't been food growing
in that part of the world

01:17:32.733 --> 01:17:34.440
since before the birth of Christ.

01:17:34.635 --> 01:17:36.808
They make us all terrified,

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:40.144
and then rather than attacking us,
they give us a gift.

01:17:40.307 --> 01:17:42.719
<i>Our station
has just received a statement</i>

01:17:42.876 --> 01:17:46.551
<i>from the radical 4400 organization
known as the Nova Group,</i>

01:17:46.713 --> 01:17:50.354
<i>claiming responsibility
for this morning's transformation.</i>

01:17:50.517 --> 01:17:52.997
<i>You are witnesses to the beginning
of a new era.</i>

01:17:53.153 --> 01:17:55.030
<i>What happens next is up to you.</i>

01:17:55.188 --> 01:17:58.726
<i>The 4400 can be mankind's
greatest ally,</i>

01:17:58.892 --> 01:18:01.338
<i>or its most dangerous adversary.</i>

01:18:01.495 --> 01:18:05.204
Don't kid yourself. It's an attack.
An act of aggression, anyway.

01:18:05.365 --> 01:18:07.605
They just showed everyone
that they can change the world,

01:18:07.734 --> 01:18:10.237
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

01:18:32.993 --> 01:18:36.600
- Hello?
- I'm very disappointed in you, Shawn.

01:18:36.763 --> 01:18:40.267
- Daniel.
<i>- I realize you're still a young man.</i>

01:18:40.801 --> 01:18:43.680
But I'm afraid I can't forgive you.

01:19:07.461 --> 01:19:11.307
<i>Keith, I'm broadcasting live
from the Nubian Desert...</i>

01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:55.876
It's okay, Kyle. Daddy's...

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:59.489
Daddy's here. I'm right here.

01:19:59.913 --> 01:20:01.915
I'm right here.

01:20:02.616 --> 01:20:04.618
Just go to sleep.

01:20:52.566 --> 01:20:54.341
Hey, I'm Tyler.

01:20:54.835 --> 01:20:56.280
Maia.

01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:35.645
<i>Lily.</i>

01:21:39.079 --> 01:21:40.990
We are here.

01:21:44.751 --> 01:21:48.699
- Hasn't changed much, has it?
- No.

01:21:50.123 --> 01:21:52.228
We were so happy here.

01:21:52.392 --> 01:21:55.032
Just you and me, and the baby.

01:21:55.428 --> 01:21:57.635
It was so much simpler.

01:21:58.899 --> 01:22:03.780
- Would you like to head on inside?
- No, not just yet.

01:22:04.738 --> 01:22:07.617
No, let's stay out here for a while.

01:22:07.774 --> 01:22:09.947
It's so peaceful.

01:22:31.331 --> 01:22:32.935
<i>Remember when you went
into labor?</i>

01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:35.609
I could hardly get the car into gear.

01:22:41.341 --> 01:22:43.787
But you gave me directions
to the hospital.

01:22:43.944 --> 01:22:45.548
How did you stay so calm?

01:22:49.449 --> 01:22:50.985
Lily?

01:22:51.305 --> 01:22:57.196
