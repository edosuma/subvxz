00:10.710 --> 00:12.500
Brian! Brian!

00:13.440 --> 00:16.590
Brian Lexington was released
from Westgate State Prison,

00:16.630 --> 00:20.540
convicted in the rape of Valerie Naff.

00:25.470 --> 00:28.870
I just happened to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

00:32.540 --> 00:34.840
I'm still in a dream.

00:34.900 --> 00:36.530
You know,
I haven't woken up yet.

00:36.540 --> 00:39.490
New DNA testing revealed he was not a match

00:39.530 --> 00:42.500
after new DNA testing at state prison.

00:42.650 --> 00:45.110
Right now I'm just really happy.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.320
Brian! Brian!

00:46.690 --> 00:49.740
Lexington stood outside
the Biscayne courthouse today

00:49.780 --> 00:51.700
a free man.

00:57.430 --> 00:59.260
...a free man.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.550
..a free man.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.900
How does it feel to be released from prison?

01:03.910 --> 01:05.550
What are you going to do first?

01:05.930 --> 01:08.840
Brian! Brian!

01:08.890 --> 01:11.180
Are you angry about the wasted
six years you spent behind bars?

01:11.210 --> 01:14.210
I don't want to dwell on the negative.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.310
I'm just glad to be out.

01:18.340 --> 01:19.540
...just glad to be out.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.380
...just glad to be out.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.860
Will the State Attorney's office
apologize to Mr. Lexington?

01:36.980 --> 01:38.030
We wish him the best.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.320
As our technological capabilities advance,

01:40.350 --> 01:42.400
so does the strength of our justice system.

01:42.460 --> 01:44.660
This day would not have been possible

01:44.700 --> 01:50.800
without Miami-Dade's Justice Project
and DNA analyst Natalia Boa Vista.

01:56.470 --> 01:59.670
Today,Brian Lexington has been exonerated.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.190
Thanks to the newest advances in DNA research,

02:02.220 --> 02:05.760
I am very proud to say
justice has been served.

02:07.890 --> 02:09.449
Lieutenant Caine.

02:10.940 --> 02:12.360
Lieutenant Caine.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.800
Valerie?

02:14.850 --> 02:16.720
I understand it's official.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.810
The conviction's been overturned.
Brian Lexington is innocent?

02:19.930 --> 02:22.410
As of right now,he's a free man.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.740
Okay,well,I need to know

02:24.780 --> 02:26.840
if he didn't rape me,then who did?

02:44.460 --> 02:51.260
CSI:Miami
Season 04 Episode 11

02:51.460 --> 02:58.260
¡¶ Payback ¡·

03:18.460 --> 03:19.970
Hey.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.430
You were visiting Valerie Naff's rape case?

03:23.860 --> 03:25.120
Yeah.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.500
So weird how life works,isn't it?

03:31.040 --> 03:32.290
When you think about it,

03:32.310 --> 03:35.400
you guys had that rapist's DNA all along.

03:35.990 --> 03:39.890
We had one foreign pubic hair
in Valerie Naff's sexual assault kit.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.690
The rapist used a condom. That is it.
One hair,one root.

03:43.720 --> 03:48.120
We had absolutely no possibility for a profile.
We just didn't have the technology back then.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.980
Exactly.And now six years later

03:51.630 --> 03:53.510
nuclear DNA is pulled from a single root,

03:53.520 --> 03:55.310
duplicated,analyzed--

03:55.550 --> 03:57.980
a profile that excluded Brian Lexington.

03:58.590 --> 03:59.960
Yeah.

04:00.010 --> 04:02.570
You really stopped the presses on that one.

04:02.940 --> 04:04.570
What's that supposed to mean?

04:04.620 --> 04:06.320
I think that it's one thing to exonerate,

04:06.360 --> 04:09.500
it's something else entirely
to hold a press conference.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.820
Why,do you think that I'm shining
a light on this lab's mistakes?

04:17.040 --> 04:20.390
and the problem is the press
doesn't always see that difference.

04:22.120 --> 04:27.200
You know,I spend every waking hour
knee-deep in lab reports and evidence logs

04:27.260 --> 04:30.420
and analyzing DNA from hundreds of different cases.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.880
Feds like to see results.

04:32.950 --> 04:38.680
So if that means that the future of this grant
depends on me making a couple of public appearances,

04:38.750 --> 04:40.810
I'm going to do it.

04:44.950 --> 04:47.050
Did you run the DNA sample
through CODIS yet?

04:47.130 --> 04:49.130
Yeah.

04:49.140 --> 04:50.950
No hits yet.

04:51.220 --> 04:53.150
We've got no suspects.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.690
Okay,well,if you need me,
I'll be in the evidence locker with Ryan.

05:13.870 --> 05:15.360
Did you pull the file?

05:15.390 --> 05:16.670
I did.

05:16.730 --> 05:20.900
Brian Lexington convicted of
the 1999 rape of Valerie Naff.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.070
These are Valerie's pajamas.

05:28.290 --> 05:29.820
Some stuff that was
collected from her house:

05:29.850 --> 05:32.770
a remote,tissue box,
ripped magazine,

05:32.830 --> 05:34.580
couple housekeys.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.200
Valerie's underwear.

05:43.240 --> 05:47.090
So Brian claimed that he stole
Valerie's underwear earlier in the day,

05:47.700 --> 05:49.290
but he didn't rape her.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.010
That was his story

05:51.070 --> 05:54.140
after we found his fingerprints
all over her underwear drawer.

05:58.340 --> 05:59.890
Brian was one of her movers,wasn't he?

05:59.920 --> 06:00.990
Yeah.

06:01.020 --> 06:03.430
So his prints would have been
all over her furniture.

06:03.490 --> 06:06.520
We also found his shoeprint
outside her bedroom window

06:06.550 --> 06:08.860
and her underwear in his car.

06:15.830 --> 06:17.870
Guy sounds like a sexual deviant.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.560
Yeah,and the victim ID'd him.

06:20.610 --> 06:21.670
I would have locked him up.

06:21.710 --> 06:22.580
We did.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.090
Unfortunately,it was for the wrong crime.
He didn't rape her.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.320
And the guy who did has been
a free man for six years.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.480
So we need to go back and take
a harder look at everything.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.450
I'm going to rerun the prints from the crime scene
six years ago and see if it matches anything new.

06:33.490 --> 06:36.110
Everything old is new again.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.730
Caine.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.480
Yes,Brian.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.190
Here I am,Caine.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.780
See?

06:44.220 --> 06:46.340
You came after me

06:46.370 --> 06:47.710
and you were wrong.

06:47.730 --> 06:49.070
Brian,

06:49.120 --> 06:51.250
on the day the lady was raped,

06:51.780 --> 06:56.810
we caught you with a pair of her underwear,
so you understand my concern about you.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.690
I didn't rape her.

06:58.730 --> 07:00.160
No,apparently not.

07:00.190 --> 07:01.510
What can I do for you today?

07:01.550 --> 07:04.020
A little late for that,
don't you think?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.120
Half-dozen years.

07:06.970 --> 07:09.530
I'm filing a lawsuit

07:09.590 --> 07:13.930
naming you and this department
and anyone else I can think of.

07:13.970 --> 07:16.650
- That's your right.
- Malicious prosecution.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.670
Not to mention the injuries
I received in prison.

07:19.710 --> 07:22.970
And I'm hiring George Hammett to represent me.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.260
You'll be a perfect match.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.640
I want to be sure

07:27.690 --> 07:30.680
that I get what I'm entitled to.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.700
I'm certain you will,Brian.
And Brian?

07:33.900 --> 07:37.960
For your sake,I hope
I never see you in here again.

07:48.270 --> 07:49.810
Alexx,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.810
I want you to see something.

07:53.020 --> 07:56.040
Girl slammed into the center
divider on the 95 doing 80.

07:56.290 --> 07:57.420
DUI?

07:57.440 --> 08:00.800
Police said there were no skid marks at the scene,
so she didn't step on the brakes.

08:01.210 --> 08:04.860
Weird thing is her trauma's
not bad enough to kill her.

08:04.910 --> 08:06.740
Could be internal trauma.

08:06.780 --> 08:08.600
Let's see what we've got.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.540
She had a tough couple months.

08:14.550 --> 08:16.990
Appendectomy scar's still healing.

08:17.050 --> 08:18.280
It looks infected.

08:20.210 --> 08:23.020
Kept the incision from healing properly.

08:34.150 --> 08:35.980
Oh,my God.

08:38.890 --> 08:40.720
That's no infection I've ever seen.

08:40.740 --> 08:43.130
It's a surgical sponge from the appy.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.330
The infection built until
it sent her into toxic shock.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.860
Could have hit when she was driving.

08:50.840 --> 08:54.200
What kind of hacks do they let
practice medicine these days?

08:54.740 --> 08:57.900
My question exactly.

09:07.690 --> 09:09.300
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.030
You have to see what I found in Valerie's pajamas.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.340
Where am I looking?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.810
Near the missing button.
You see it?

09:17.850 --> 09:19.740
Silver flakes,yeah.

09:19.790 --> 09:21.840
It's a powder.Trace ran it.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.740
"Graphite powder."
What does that mean?

09:25.770 --> 09:30.700
Locksmiths inject graphite powder
into keyways to lubricate locking mechanisms.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.940
And Valerie probably had her
locks replaced when she moved in.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.830
Then why is there graphite
powder on Valerie's pajamas?

09:46.250 --> 09:48.660
I've got a pretty good idea.

09:52.980 --> 09:55.110
We questioned everyone who
came in and out of that house,

09:55.130 --> 09:58.430
including the locksmith,
but I think this deserves another round.

10:04.540 --> 10:07.150
Look,I told them all this years ago.

10:07.510 --> 10:09.600
I re-keyed the whole place that day,

10:09.670 --> 10:12.020
left three keys,was gone by noon.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.980
How do you explain the graphite
powder on her pajamas?

10:15.010 --> 10:16.920
I installed a bedroom lock.

10:16.970 --> 10:19.230
She was unpacking.
Her clothes were everywhere.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.260
I thought you had the guy.

10:21.310 --> 10:23.480
He wasn't the rapist.
The case has been reopened.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.170
So has your background:
18 months ago,

10:25.180 --> 10:27.330
you were arrested for domestic violence.

10:27.830 --> 10:30.400
Yeah,well,my ex is the one with the temper.

10:32.390 --> 10:33.840
Listen,lady,

10:33.890 --> 10:36.740
you've got the wrong guy.

10:36.810 --> 10:40.170
Then you won't mind giving us a DNA sample.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.440
Hey,wait up.

10:51.090 --> 10:52.450
Hey.What's up?

10:52.520 --> 10:54.130
Nothing. I,uh...

10:56.440 --> 10:59.600
Your bracelet,I found it in my couch.
I thought you might want it back.

11:00.370 --> 11:01.700
Thanks.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.250
You're welcome.

11:05.110 --> 11:06.200
Yeah.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.910
I had a great time last night.

11:08.230 --> 11:09.880
Me,too.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.390
Next time we'll have to
actually watch the movie.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.940
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:15.690 --> 11:17.240
All right,I got to get back in the field.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.120
Okay. Oh,well,take this with you.

11:20.470 --> 11:21.970
Why?

11:22.430 --> 11:24.420
It's not mine.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.920
My bad.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.420
So bad.

11:33.890 --> 11:35.360
Eric.

11:35.950 --> 11:37.840
Can I borrow you for a second?

11:38.060 --> 11:40.300
You can have him.

11:40.810 --> 11:42.480
Thank you.

11:44.380 --> 11:45.870
What's going on?

11:46.120 --> 11:47.620
Nothing.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.180
What have you got?

11:50.220 --> 11:52.210
Kelly Gerber,22.

11:54.850 --> 11:55.890
It's a car accident.

11:55.910 --> 11:58.580
That's the TC report.
Compare it to mine.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.940
Infection killed her?

12:02.970 --> 12:04.780
From a shoddy appendectomy.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.140
She was dead before she hit the guardrail.

12:07.570 --> 12:09.540
Okay,then the hospital's the crime scene.

12:09.590 --> 12:10.670
I'll sniff around.

12:10.710 --> 12:12.160
I'd appreciate that.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.180
Call me.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.550
Will do.

12:30.840 --> 12:31.780
Dr. Forest,please dial 118.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.700
Gerber? I'm sorry,I don't. Last week?

12:34.770 --> 12:36.570
Yeah,it was an appendectomy.

12:37.780 --> 12:38.830
That's probably why.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.990
It was sandwiched between
two coronary artery bypasses.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.730
One of them had complications.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.080
Doctor,the girl died.

12:46.270 --> 12:47.700
Really?

12:48.340 --> 12:49.400
Yeah.

12:49.440 --> 12:52.530
Our ME said the cause of death was toxic shock.

12:52.820 --> 12:57.630
Well,as sorry as I am,
you do realize that no surgery is ever routine.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.380
I do.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.700
I also know that mistakes can be made.

13:09.460 --> 13:10.760
I have to,uh,

13:10.820 --> 13:13.890
remove a tumor from a
58-year-old lung cancer patient.

13:18.140 --> 13:21.710
You do realize that these questions
aren't going to go away.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.630
I do,and I'm not running from them.

13:25.810 --> 13:27.710
Excuse me.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.690
So,where are we at?

13:47.880 --> 13:50.810
Well,Calleigh brought me
the swab from the locksmith,

13:51.290 --> 13:53.560
but it doesn't match the DNA from the pubic hair.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.750
It doesn't?

14:00.690 --> 14:02.590
I really thought we had him.

14:02.690 --> 14:03.690
What's that?

14:03.740 --> 14:04.780
Plan "B"?

14:04.850 --> 14:06.720
No,it's more like "W."

14:06.950 --> 14:10.780
The locksmith told Calleigh he brought
three new keys on the day of the crime.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.360
There's only two in here.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.140
Someone took a key off the ring?

14:15.560 --> 14:17.380
Might be some skin cells.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.720
Maybe.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.520
Will you swab the keyring for epithelials?

14:23.360 --> 14:25.510
I'm the one who started
this whole merry-go-round.

14:25.570 --> 14:27.060
Thank you.

15:12.450 --> 15:13.750
Horatio?

15:14.940 --> 15:15.470
Yeah?

15:15.500 --> 15:18.660
I have information on the old rape case,
or new rape case.

15:18.730 --> 15:19.710
I'm listening.

15:19.750 --> 15:23.220
Ryan had me process a keyring found
at Valerie Naff's house six years ago.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.800
It had Valerie's epithelials on it,

15:24.820 --> 15:28.580
but it also had male epithelials
that match the DNA from the pubic hair.

15:28.630 --> 15:31.650
So our rapist has a key to the front door.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.810
And let himself in.

15:36.850 --> 15:40.840
Which means he's still out
there with that same key.

15:56.290 --> 16:01.360
I don't know. I just can't talk to you face to
face like this.It's too much. It's too soon.

16:01.450 --> 16:04.130
No,Valerie. It's too late.

16:05.910 --> 16:08.190
Don't you think an apology is in order?

16:08.280 --> 16:09.600
Everything all right,guys?

16:09.650 --> 16:11.460
It will be,as soon as he leaves.

16:12.290 --> 16:13.600
You can't run,

16:13.640 --> 16:14.870
not this time.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.520
Brian,I believe the lady asked you to leave.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.760
It's a free country,

16:19.950 --> 16:21.830
and I am a free man.

16:21.860 --> 16:25.850
You are,but you're standing on
private property,so take off.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.240
You okay?

16:35.130 --> 16:37.020
He's naming me in the lawsuit.

16:37.410 --> 16:38.380
Wrongful accusations.

16:38.390 --> 16:40.670
He's naming a lot of people,Valerie.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.160
Could I come in,please?

16:45.730 --> 16:47.230
Yeah.

16:47.970 --> 16:49.800
Come on in.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.050
Valerie,

16:54.080 --> 16:58.670
we have reason to believe that the man who raped
you did not come in through the bedroom window.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.480
Well,then,so how did he get in?

17:01.580 --> 17:03.510
We think he had a key.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.740
Now,I know it's been six years,
but try to remember,

17:07.810 --> 17:10.569
who else had a key to this house?

17:11.270 --> 17:13.900
I remember his breath,

17:14.260 --> 17:15.200
his grip.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.069
I don't remember a key.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.839
Okay,what about your boyfriend,Doug?

17:21.119 --> 17:24.339
Doug and I didn't get together
until after the incident.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.339
So he never had a key.

17:26.390 --> 17:28.260
He doesn't have a key now.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.340
Nobody has access to my home but me.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.560
Somebody had a key,Valerie.

17:37.530 --> 17:40.710
Lieutenant,you're telling me
that the person that did this to me

17:40.740 --> 17:44.350
could have been living around me for
the last six years with a key to my house,

17:44.390 --> 17:46.810
and I wouldn't know who it is?

17:47.080 --> 17:49.000
It's possible.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.150
You Alexx Woods?

18:01.170 --> 18:02.920
Dr. Woods.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.700
You must be Dr. Kessler.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.490
Yeah,you want to tell me what's going on?
What are you doing?

18:07.530 --> 18:10.700
Trying to pull a bullet
out of this guy's kidney.

18:10.730 --> 18:13.980
Sending an investigator
over to question my competence?

18:14.170 --> 18:18.020
What happens in my OR
is none of your business.

18:18.080 --> 18:23.820
A 22-year-old girl ended up in my morgue
with a surgical sponge in her gut.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.490
Well,it's not my job to count sponges.

18:25.510 --> 18:26.830
Oh...

18:26.860 --> 18:28.830
so it's the scrub nurse's fault.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.730
That's funny,'cause she said
you left in the middle of the surgery.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.980
Dr. Woods,this is my fifth year
as attending thoracic surgeon.

18:37.020 --> 18:42.330
Do you have any idea how many people are out
there living happy,healthy lives because of me?

18:44.340 --> 18:46.340
Try to sticking to the dead ones.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.650
Try not sending them to me.

18:55.350 --> 18:57.270
There's something we're not seeing.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.920
Exactly.

18:59.340 --> 19:02.370
Horatio said she kept her keys on a shelf.

19:02.590 --> 19:04.030
Yeah,I see them there.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.490
If he touched that shelf,
his prints are gone by now.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.880
What about the picture frame
on the shelf next to the keys?

19:08.910 --> 19:10.390
It's a gift.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.430
It's a picture of her house.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.010
Housewarming.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.730
Another visitor with opportunity.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.630
So someone gave her a gift and stole a key.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.690
What are the odds she still has the gift?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.700
It's been six years.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.570
You're OCD.Have you ever
thrown a picture frame away ever?

19:34.630 --> 19:36.620
I'll call her.

19:40.030 --> 19:40.700
Hello?

19:40.720 --> 19:43.180
Hi,Valerie,it's Ryan Wolfe,
Miami-Dade CSI.

19:43.420 --> 19:44.430
Hi.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.500
Yeah,we're just going through a case file.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.220
Well,we're looking at old photographs
of your house from the day you moved in.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.640
Let me ask you something.

19:50.690 --> 19:54.760
Do you remember if someone gave you
a sterling silver picture frame as a gift?

19:55.070 --> 19:58.730
Uh,yeah,my real estate agent,
Jeff Colson,gave it to me.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.400
Okay,great.
Thank you so much.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.460
It was the real estate agent.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.730
No,you're wrong,way off.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.040
I've been asked these questions all before.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.620
Well,the case has been reopened.

20:11.650 --> 20:13.870
Turns out the guy that raped
her stole the housekey.

20:13.960 --> 20:14.880
Look,

20:14.890 --> 20:18.370
I still think it was Brian Lexington,that mover.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.580
I was with Valerie on moving day.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.360
He was practically drooling
whenever she walked by.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.020
He probably stole her key.

20:25.070 --> 20:27.530
Yes,but,Jeff,proximity says you did.

20:28.370 --> 20:29.480
Let's have a toast.

20:29.510 --> 20:31.700
I just have to find my champagne glasses.

20:34.580 --> 20:36.740
And then you came back that night.

20:44.430 --> 20:47.840
All the evidence is pointing right at you,Jeff.

20:50.780 --> 20:54.610
You might want to give me a DNA sample
and eliminate yourself as a suspect.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.470
Get a warrant.

21:15.300 --> 21:16.000
Hey, Jessica.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.800
Can you stick this warrant under his nose?

21:17.900 --> 21:18.700
I need a signature.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.800
The judge is returning to chambers in five minutes.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.000
You got your supporting docs?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.100
Uh, yeah.

21:26.400 --> 21:26.900
You gonna sign it?

21:39.900 --> 21:41.700
- That the warrant, Frank?
- Yeah.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.100
Judge Harrison's our go-to,

21:43.500 --> 21:44.400
sealed and delivered.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.000
Colson's camped out here today trying to sell this dump.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.400
Let's go to the open house.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.300
All right.

21:59.100 --> 21:59.700
Hey, Jeff?

22:02.700 --> 22:03.200
Jeff?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.600
Miami-Dade Police, Jeff.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.600
Maybe he's out back.

22:12.100 --> 22:12.600
Frank...

22:14.000 --> 22:14.800
he's right there.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.600
Talk about a rush to judgment.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.700
This is no coincidence, Frank.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.100
So somebody knew he was our primary suspect.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.700
And beat us to him.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.800
Guess you won't be needing that search warrant for his DNA.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.600
This'll tell us if he's the rapist.

23:01.300 --> 23:01.900
Ugh.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.200
Multiple contusions to his scalp.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.500
He was hit upside the head withsomething, honey.

23:10.300 --> 23:12.100
Vic also took some body blows.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.600
Bruised abdomen...and ribs.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.700
There's a considerable amount of injurieshere, Horatio.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.800
This attack was overkill.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.800
Looking to buy?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.500
Not in this lifetime, Alexx.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.800
There was a piece of sculpture here.

23:33.000 --> 23:33.900
What are you thinking?

23:34.300 --> 23:36.300
I'm thinking it was the murder weapon.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.100
Tell you this:

23:40.700 --> 23:41.700
it was personal.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.600
Fueled by rage.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.600
And nobody has more than a rape victim.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.500
Are you sure, Lieutenant Caine?

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
My real estate agent.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.200
There must be a mistake.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.100
It doesn't appear to be the case, Valerie.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.500
I thought he was one of the good guys.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.900
I recommended him to my friends.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.400
I mean, I spent hours with him looking at houses.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.700
Empty houses.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.000
How did I miss it?

24:21.900 --> 24:23.300
You know what I don't want to do?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.300
I don't want to make this your fault.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.500
Who killed him?

24:34.500 --> 24:36.000
Well, I'm trying to determine that,

24:36.100 --> 24:37.400
and so what I'm doing

24:37.800 --> 24:40.600
is I'm talking to all the people who knew Jeff

24:40.700 --> 24:41.900
and I need to talk to you.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.300
That's why I'm really here, isn't it?

24:51.500 --> 24:52.600
I'm a suspect.

24:57.300 --> 24:57.800
Um...

24:59.000 --> 25:01.200
Where were you two hours ago

25:01.300 --> 25:02.200
and what were you doing?

25:03.800 --> 25:04.700
I was at home.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.200
You were at home with your boyfriend Doug?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.000
Doug didn't do this.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.400
He's the only one I can count on.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.800
He's been with me through everything.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.800
Where would I find Doug...

25:20.800 --> 25:21.600
right now?

25:37.600 --> 25:38.600
Going somewhere?

25:39.200 --> 25:40.300
My girlfriend deserves a vacation.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.500
Thinking about tooling around the Caribbean.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.600
Can I help you with something?

25:45.200 --> 25:46.500
Calleigh Duquesne, CSI.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.800
Fairline's a safe bet, 39 knots.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.200
It's a large purchase on a landscaper's salary.

25:57.900 --> 25:59.000
I get a lot of work.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.000
Is that where you smashed your knuckles-- at work?

26:02.100 --> 26:03.500
Oh, comes with the territory.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.400
Yardwork.

26:04.700 --> 26:05.700
Hands take a beating.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.300
Jeff Colson took a beating, too.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.800
Should I know who that is?

26:11.300 --> 26:11.900
Maybe.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.700
He raped your girlfriend six years ago.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.000
Wait, are you saying you found him?

26:17.700 --> 26:18.300
The real guy?

26:19.200 --> 26:20.700
We found him dead. Yeah.

26:23.900 --> 26:24.400
Really.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.000
Does Valerie know?

26:26.100 --> 26:26.700
Have you told her?

26:27.300 --> 26:27.800
We have.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.400
She's under investigation as well.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.900
I know she never thought you'd get her attacker.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.700
To be honest, neither did I.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.700
Did you get to him first?

26:38.000 --> 26:38.600
What?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.700
Look, I have no idea how he wound up dead,

26:42.800 --> 26:43.500
but, uh,

26:44.600 --> 26:45.800
after what Valerie and I have been through

26:45.900 --> 26:48.000
I think we'll both sleep better knowing he is.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.500
As long as you sleep on dry land.

26:51.200 --> 26:51.700
Pardon?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.300
We're gonna want to talk to you again.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.200
Boa Vista, can I talk to you for a second?

27:05.600 --> 27:06.500
Yeah, what's up?

27:06.700 --> 27:08.500
Did you talk to anybody about my DNA request?

27:08.800 --> 27:10.000
- For the search warrant?
- Yeah.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.600
- No.Who would I talk to?
- Well, I don't know.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.500
- You've been pretty chummywith the press lately.
- Did you page me?

27:15.600 --> 27:18.400
You know, everybody knows that cops corner the market on gossip, Frank.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.600
Don't come interrogating me.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.300
I hand-walked that search warrant directly to Judge Harrison.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.600
Now, there's information on this investigation,

27:24.800 --> 27:26.400
and it's leaking from somewhere.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.200
You know, it may have nothing to do with you guys.

27:29.200 --> 27:29.800
What do you mean?

27:30.900 --> 27:32.500
There might be a mole in the department.

27:33.000 --> 27:33.900
Are you serious?

27:34.100 --> 27:36.200
I got it from a pretty reputable source.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.500
They say it's someone in the lab.

27:38.900 --> 27:39.400
Well, that's easy.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.400
Who's got a grudge?

27:41.300 --> 27:42.600
They say it's someone we like,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.300
someone we, uh, trust.

27:46.200 --> 27:46.800
Well, whoever it is,

27:46.900 --> 27:49.000
somebody got to our rape suspect before we did.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.500
Not a suspect anymore.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.200
Here's the DNA on your dead real estate agent.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.300
I just ran it.

27:59.000 --> 27:59.900
He's the rapist.

28:01.200 --> 28:01.700
Wow.

28:02.100 --> 28:03.100
So, six years ago,

28:03.200 --> 28:05.300
Jeff Colson raped Valerie Naff.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.100
You were after the right guy.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.200
It's one case closed.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.100
One wide open.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.400
What did you get on the glass, Eric?

28:25.300 --> 28:27.500
A whole bunch of minerals in the doctor's OJ.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.600
The AA showed traces of calcium and magnesium,

28:30.700 --> 28:33.000
and, uh, the MS--I'm waiting for the results now.

28:35.700 --> 28:38.900
The MS found vitamin B6 and 5-HTP.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.300
I guess it's nothing.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.200
It's just vitamins to keep him healthy.

28:43.700 --> 28:44.900
Or to keep his secret.

28:45.800 --> 28:46.400
What do you mean?

28:47.700 --> 28:50.300
The 5-HTP in combination with the other vitamins--

28:50.400 --> 28:52.600
also known as minimizing supplements.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.700
Minimizing for what?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.000
The side effects of Ecstasy.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.800
He was sweating bullets in my morgue,

28:58.900 --> 29:00.600
and you know how cold we keep that room.

29:01.900 --> 29:06.400
Why would a 36-year-old thoracic surgeon take Ecstasy on a regular basis?

29:06.600 --> 29:08.500
He should be past that kind of partying.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.700
Maybe it's not about the party.

29:16.900 --> 29:18.300
My sister-- she, um...

29:21.900 --> 29:25.400
She deals with nausea and pain that never lets up.

29:26.800 --> 29:27.400
Ever.

29:30.100 --> 29:30.900
Marisol.

29:31.900 --> 29:32.400
I heard.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.500
I'm sorry, Eric.

29:37.700 --> 29:39.800
I don't know.You look for relief anywhere you can get it.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.400
Legal or not.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.400
Thank you.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.100
One phone call to the Chief of Staff--

29:58.200 --> 29:59.600
they'll do a urine test.

29:59.700 --> 30:00.800
One call.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.100
Okay, you want me to get into a program?

30:07.000 --> 30:07.500
Done.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.300
You're not putting up much of a fight.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.000
You're not giving me a whole lot of options.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.900
I suppose I'm not.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.000
Especially when you're worried

30:18.400 --> 30:21.800
what an investigation into your Ecstasy use might uncover.

30:22.700 --> 30:23.300
What?

30:26.300 --> 30:27.200
The sweating,

30:28.200 --> 30:29.500
the eyelid tremor.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.500
What happens in my OR?

30:33.900 --> 30:35.900
They're early signs of Parkinson's.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.200
It's not recreational.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.200
It's professional.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.400
It keeps the tremors under control.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.900
It stops my hands from shaking.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.500
And your hands were shaking

30:58.600 --> 31:01.500
when you were performing Kelly Gerber's appendectomy.

31:02.700 --> 31:05.300
And that's why you left in the middle of the procedure.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.400
I'm on top of it.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.000
For how long?

31:19.100 --> 31:19.800
I don't know.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.800
But... in the meantime,

31:23.900 --> 31:25.400
I can still do some good.

31:27.700 --> 31:28.700
And when I can't,

31:30.100 --> 31:30.800
I'll stop.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
But that day's not here yet.

31:40.100 --> 31:40.800
Doctor...

31:43.300 --> 31:45.100
that day has passed.

32:07.100 --> 32:08.800
Valerie says she was alone.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.700
Boyfriend says he was at the marina.

32:12.900 --> 32:13.900
What if we're off track?

32:15.700 --> 32:19.000
What if the murder of the real estate agent was a crime of opportunity?

32:20.400 --> 32:21.700
What if it's unrelated to the rape?

32:22.100 --> 32:23.600
Open houses are sitting ducks.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.500
Yeah, somebody goes in there to rob the place.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.100
Real estate agent gets in the way.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.100
What about overkill?

32:29.200 --> 32:30.900
Overkill doesn't have to mean personal.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.800
...By the convicted rapist Brian Lexington...

32:33.500 --> 32:34.900
Valerie Naff's on the news.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.400
...after serving six years of that 1999 sentence.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.900
On October 8, 1999,

32:42.100 --> 32:43.400
in a court of law,

32:44.100 --> 32:47.200
suffering from the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.500
I, Valerie Naff,

32:49.800 --> 32:53.100
identified Brian Lexington as the man who raped me.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.300
I now know that this allegation is incorrect,

32:56.500 --> 32:58.300
and I recant my statement.

32:58.500 --> 33:02.800
I would like to offer my sincerest apologies to Brian Lexington and his family.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.000
- That was rape victim Valerie Naff...
- A public statement.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.300
That's odd timing.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
Horatio, it's Calleigh.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.100
You're not gonna believe this.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.300
That's all for now.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.100
I don't have anything else to say.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.100
I said it all in my press conference.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.100
That's quite a change of heart.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.100
I felt bad for him.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.300
- It was my testimony that put him behind bars.
- Valerie, the other day,

33:35.400 --> 33:38.400
I witnessed a conversation between you and Brian at your house.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.200
What was the substance of it?

33:40.900 --> 33:43.200
- What difference does it make?
- It makes a big difference,

33:43.800 --> 33:44.400
and here's why.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.700
I think he invited you to join the lawsuit against the county.

33:49.700 --> 33:54.100
You accepted knowing that the jury will award him triple if he has the victim...

33:54.200 --> 33:54.900
You know I'm right.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.600
Don't you judge me.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.600
I deserve whatever I can get.

33:59.700 --> 34:00.700
That night changed everything.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.600
I have never been the same.

34:02.700 --> 34:06.000
Valerie, somebody wanted the man who raped you dead.

34:06.100 --> 34:07.900
Now, I'm beginning to think it's Brian.

34:10.199 --> 34:10.699
Brian?

34:13.100 --> 34:16.400
Valerie, he has a fixation with you that is common knowledge.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.400
He did call me,

34:21.500 --> 34:23.900
and he said that he thought Jeff was a suspect.

34:25.100 --> 34:25.600
Excuse me.

34:29.699 --> 34:30.800
Yeah, Frank.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.100
Brian Lexington--

34:32.199 --> 34:33.600
scoop him up, please.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.100
Do you think Brian Lexington killed Jeff Colson?

34:36.199 --> 34:38.199
He had six years to think about it, Valerie.

34:56.100 --> 34:56.699
Hey.

34:57.000 --> 34:57.500
Hey.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.400
We're not running on a whole lot of physical evidence, Alexx.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.200
Is our victim going to be able to help us?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.700
Real estate man put up quite a fight.

35:06.700 --> 35:09.200
Forearm bruising indicates self-defense.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.200
But it didn't stop him from being punched like a heavy bag.

35:15.800 --> 35:19.000
Three cracked ribs and a bruised pancreas.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.200
So what killed him?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.600
Intracranial hemorrhaging.

35:24.300 --> 35:27.500
Four depressed skull fractures to the parietal bone.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.500
That's what killed him.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.700
Horatio showed me the potential murder weapon from the house fire.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.600
Yeah, a marble sculpture.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.000
And these two marks seem consistent.

35:46.300 --> 35:49.000
If someone hit you four times with,

35:49.600 --> 35:50.300
I don't know,

35:51.100 --> 35:52.500
say a tire iron,

35:52.900 --> 35:55.800
your head would break apart like Humpty Dumpty.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.200
But his skull only cracked.

35:57.300 --> 35:57.900
What does that mean,

35:58.000 --> 35:58.900
that the killer let up?

35:59.300 --> 36:01.600
Or your killer was hurt in the fight.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.300
Sustained some kind of injury.

36:03.800 --> 36:04.400
Wait a minute.

36:05.000 --> 36:05.600
What?

36:06.200 --> 36:07.500
Could be an old injury.

36:07.700 --> 36:09.900
Brian Lexington's file said that he got beat up in jail.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.100
He got stabbed.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.300
I'm going to pull his medical records,

36:13.400 --> 36:14.500
and I'm going to see how bad.

36:14.900 --> 36:15.500
Thank you, Alexx.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.900
Is my client a suspect in your murder investigation?

36:21.200 --> 36:23.200
We're sure as hell not here to sip tea, Hammett.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.900
Why would I kill Jeff Colson?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.200
Because he put you in prison for six years.

36:27.700 --> 36:28.800
I've moved on with my life.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.900
Yes, but that's not what your lawsuit says.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Look, you filed a subpoena for my client's medical records.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.000
Questions about a stab wound he sustained in prison.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.300
This man received a clean bill of health when he was released.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.500
Be that as it may,

36:44.600 --> 36:47.100
I want him to raise his hands over his head right now.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.000
Okay.

36:54.000 --> 36:54.600
As you can see,

36:54.700 --> 36:56.200
my client isn't handicapped.

36:56.300 --> 36:57.200
Full range of motion.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.900
I think we've answered all your questions.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.400
Not all my questions, counselor.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.700
Brian, how did you know that Jeff Colson was the rapist?

37:04.900 --> 37:06.100
There are leaks out there.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.400
- You just have to know where to find them.
- Don't...

37:08.800 --> 37:09.500
say another word.

37:10.100 --> 37:10.800
We're leaving.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.400
The victim was a rapist,lieutenant.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.800
Refocus your efforts.

37:16.900 --> 37:17.400
Move on.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.300
Thank you, counselor.

37:20.000 --> 37:20.700
Noted.

37:21.800 --> 37:22.600
Frank?

37:24.400 --> 37:25.500
This guy's too stupid.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.600
I missed a step somewhere.

37:26.700 --> 37:29.300
- I'll keep digging.
- I want to take a look at the attorney, Frank.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.000
- Hammett?
- He's involved.

37:37.800 --> 37:38.500
Hey Jessica?

37:38.800 --> 37:40.500
Can I stick this warrant under his nose?

37:41.000 --> 37:41.700
I need a signature.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.100
I'm here for a pickup.

37:43.400 --> 37:43.900
Hold on, honey.

37:46.200 --> 37:46.800
You going to sign it?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.100
Oh, right.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.500
Yeah-yeah, it was a warrant.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.800
Last name was "Colson."

37:58.300 --> 37:58.800
Hammett?

37:58.900 --> 38:02.400
Frank, how many discussions do we need on Brian Lexington before you move on?

38:02.500 --> 38:03.500
This isn't about your client.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.400
It's about you.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.200
What's the problem?

38:05.300 --> 38:06.800
Let's start with bribing messengers.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.500
Bribing? What?

38:08.600 --> 38:09.600
Cut the performance, Hammett.

38:09.700 --> 38:12.400
I got a 20-year-old gofer at Liaison Messenger Service

38:12.500 --> 38:14.500
practically has your number on his speed-dial.

38:14.700 --> 38:18.000
How much cash did you slip in his pocket to get an inside track on search warrants?

38:18.900 --> 38:20.000
Not enough, apparently.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.800
Information on your rape investigation helps me poke holes in the old one.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.400
It strengthens my client's civil suit.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.200
You told your client we were on to Jeff Colson.

38:29.300 --> 38:30.900
Now, that sounds like conspiracy to me.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.900
I never thought it would lead to his murder.

38:33.000 --> 38:33.800
Well, you thought wrong.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.000
At the very least,

38:35.100 --> 38:38.000
the Florida State Bar Association will have something to say about this.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.800
You're going to be flipping burgers when it's all said and done.

39:02.400 --> 39:02.900
Hey.

39:03.200 --> 39:03.700
Hey.

39:07.700 --> 39:08.700
Where'd you get the new photo?

39:09.200 --> 39:10.400
Owners of the house.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.700
They'd planned to auction this before it disappeared.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.100
- It weighed in at 25 pounds.
- Oh, yeah?

39:15.700 --> 39:16.400
Check this out.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.700
Valerie's boyfriend,

39:17.800 --> 39:18.300
Doug Stets,

39:18.400 --> 39:23.000
was admitted to Dade Memorial Hospital August 19, 2003,

39:23.500 --> 39:24.600
for emergency surgery.

39:24.900 --> 39:25.500
What kind of surgery?

39:27.600 --> 39:28.300
Oh, my God.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.500
We should send a car over to the marina right away.

39:31.500 --> 39:32.600
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.300
I punched him a few times to send him a message.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.200
But that's it.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.200
You killed him, Doug,

39:36.300 --> 39:37.600
because he raped your girlfriend.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.800
Raise your arms above your head.

39:41.800 --> 39:42.500
Do it, Doug.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.800
Both arms, smart-ass.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.300
Can't do it,can you?

39:54.900 --> 39:55.800
It's a shoulder strain.

39:55.900 --> 39:57.100
I play baseball on weekends.

39:57.300 --> 39:59.700
But that's not where you got your injury,is it, Doug?

40:00.100 --> 40:03.300
You sustained a permanent injury on a job site.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.100
What's that?

40:04.300 --> 40:05.300
It's a hospital record

40:05.500 --> 40:07.900
that describes how your shoulder was broken

40:08.000 --> 40:10.900
and your axillary nerve was severed.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.000
Yeah, I broke my shoulder.

40:17.100 --> 40:17.700
So what?

40:17.900 --> 40:19.000
Nerve damage, Doug.

40:19.300 --> 40:20.500
Colson took lots of body shots

40:20.600 --> 40:21.900
because you couldn't raise your arm.

40:27.900 --> 40:28.800
And the murder weapon,

40:28.900 --> 40:30.700
that statue, weighs 25 pounds.

40:30.900 --> 40:31.900
I didn't swing that.

40:32.300 --> 40:33.000
You couldn't.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.300
Least not very well.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.000
That's why you only cracked his skull instead of splitting it open.

40:37.100 --> 40:37.700
Hey, Frank.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Excuse me, Doug.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.100
Frank...

40:41.600 --> 40:43.900
the killer has limited upper-body strength.

40:45.200 --> 40:45.900
So, it's him.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.300
No, it's a woman.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.200
You killed Jeff, Valerie.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.500
I thought if I joined the lawsuit,

41:40.600 --> 41:41.700
that it would make it better.

41:43.900 --> 41:46.400
But no dollar amount is going to make me right again.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.900
He found me this house.

41:53.600 --> 41:54.900
You know, I trusted him.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.800
I believed him when he told me that Brian raped me.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.000
And then when I found out that it was Jeff,

42:06.100 --> 42:06.900
it's just, I...

42:08.500 --> 42:10.000
I saw his face everywhere.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.300
It just haunted me.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.700
He wasn't a man spending his life behind bars.

42:19.800 --> 42:23.500
He was living it like nothing had ever happened.

42:23.700 --> 42:24.300
Like...

42:25.600 --> 42:27.800
he had no memory of what he did to me.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.300
I trusted you.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.200
I trusted you!

42:58.000 --> 43:00.400
You understand why I did what I did?

43:03.700 --> 43:06.600
Valerie, you were in a very difficult position.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.300
- So you approve?
- No.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.300
I don't approve.

43:13.300 --> 43:14.800
But I understand how you got there.

43:19.500 --> 43:20.600
What's going to happen to me?

43:22.300 --> 43:23.300
Whatever it is...

43:23.900 --> 43:25.100
I'm going to walk you through it.

43:25.900 --> 43:26.400
You're right.
