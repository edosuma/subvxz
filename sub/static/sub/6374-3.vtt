00:01.700 --> 00:04.000
AND ????

00:04.000 --> 00:05.900
IF BRADFORD MEADE
IS YO' DADDY.

00:05.900 --> 00:08.100
(man) IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S
BELOVED DOG HALSTON.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.300
PARTIAL RETROGRADE AMNESIA?
THE LAST THING
ALEXIS REMEMBERS

00:11.300 --> 00:13.400
IS MOM'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
TWO YEARS AGO.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.100
WITH ALEXIS
STILL IN THE HOSPITAL,

00:15.100 --> 00:17.200
I WANT TO POSTPONE
THE WEDDING.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.300
YOUR FATHER WAS A HERO.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.500
?????

00:19.500 --> 00:20.800
(Justin) NO, I'M NOT.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.100
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL NEED
AN INTERN AROUND THE OFFICE

00:23.100 --> 00:25.100
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS
BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.300
OH, MY GOD!

00:26.300 --> 00:28.300
AND MY DAD'S
ILL STUCK IN MEXICO.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.300
(Ignacio) I KILLED IGNACIO SUAREZ?

00:30.300 --> 00:31.300
????

00:32.299 --> 00:34.900
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS BABY OF YOURS.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.700
CHRISTINA TOLD ME ABOUT CHARLIE,
THAT SHE CHEATED ON ME.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.800
CHARLIE WAS THE ONLY REASON
WE COULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.400
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU,
BETTY.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.000
HENRY,'RE DRUNK.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.700
(slurs)
AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.200
HENRY, STOP.

00:56.300 --> 01:00.200
LOOK, THIS IS NOT HOW I EVER
PICTURED US BEING TOGETHER.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.500
YOU'RE DRUNK
OF... WINE COOLERS.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.200
"MELON AND APRICOT."
IT'S GROSS.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.100
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.100
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.900
I HAD A CIGARETTE, TOO.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.500
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT
CHARLIE AND THAT DENTIST?

01:19.100 --> 01:19.700
I...

01:21.900 --> 01:23.800
LOOK, I'VE WANTED TO.
I JUST...

01:24.900 --> 01:27.300
STARTED THINKING THAT MAYBE
IT WASN'T THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.400
HENRY,
THERE IS A BABY INVOLVED.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.100
WHICH MIGHT NOT BE MINE.
BUT MAYBE IT IS,

01:32.400 --> 01:35.200
AND I-I CAN'T GET
MY HEART BROKEN AGAIN.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.400
IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD
IS TELLING US

01:37.400 --> 01:38.700
WE SHOULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.700
WE'RE LIKE
MELON AND APRICOT.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.000
LOOK,
I DO WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.200
I DO, IT'S...

01:47.600 --> 01:51.300
IT'S JUST--
WE DON'T KNOW WHOSE BABY IT IS,

01:52.300 --> 01:53.700
AND WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT,

01:55.600 --> 01:56.800
AND I CAN DO THAT

01:58.500 --> 01:59.700
IF YOU CAN.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:10.300 --> 02:11.600
(Daniel) WOW.
(Amanda) YEAH.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.900
THAT'S IT?
THOSE ARE
THE D.N.A. RESULTS.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.400
SO, UH, H-HOW MANY TIMES
DO YOU THINK WE...

02:16.400 --> 02:18.300
<i>ALOT, BUT JUST REMEMBER,</i>

02:18.300 --> 02:20.000
IF YOUR DAD'S D.N.A.
DOES MATCH MINE,

02:20.000 --> 02:21.700
WE'RE ONLY HALF BROTHER
AND SISTER,

02:21.700 --> 02:23.700
WHICH MEANS IF WE DID IT,
LIKE, 20 TIMES,

02:23.700 --> 02:27.000
IT WAS ONLY WRONG TEN.
OKAY, THAT ACTUALLY
MADE SENSE TO ME.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.600
<i>YOU ARE SO MY SISTER.
OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.</i>

02:34.600 --> 02:36.500
(gasps)
BRADFORD'S NOT MY FATHER!
YOU'RE NOT MY SISTER?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.200
KISSING ISN'T WEIRD AT ALL.
IT'S GREAT.
WE'RE NOT RELATED.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.700
WE COULD KISS ALL WE WANT,
RIGHT?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.100
YEAH,
WE CAN TOTALLY DO THIS.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.700
NOTHING TABOO HERE.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.000
(giggles)
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T WE HOP IN--

02:49.000 --> 02:53.200
DANIEL, NO. I HAVE
UNRESOLVED ISSUES WITH YOU.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.000
SO JUST SQUEEZE A BOOB,
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.200
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.300
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.400
TRY THIS.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.500
IT'S TOMATO JUICE, RAW EGG
AND A LITTLE BACON GREASE...

03:12.000 --> 03:13.400
A TRICK I LEARNED
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.100
HANGOVER GONE
BY THIRD PERIOD.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.600
TASTES AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.900
SORRY WE DIDN'T
TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF

03:22.900 --> 03:24.500
BEFORE YOU WENT
TO BED LAST NIGHT,

03:24.500 --> 03:26.900
BUT WE COULD NOT UNTIE
THOSE DOUBLE KNOTS.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.400
I WORRY ABOUT TRIPPING.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.700
SO YOU MUST BE DYING
TO CALL THAT BITCH.

03:31.700 --> 03:32.700
CHARLIE?

03:34.400 --> 03:35.700
HONESTLY, I'M AFRAID TO.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.200
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO
WHEN I HEAR HER VOICE.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.600
I' NEVER BEEN THIS MAD.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.800
THIS IS YOU MAD?

03:42.900 --> 03:43.600
YEAH.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.100
I FEEL LIKE
A FEMALE ORANGUTAN

03:46.100 --> 03:47.200
WHEN SHE'S IN ESTROUS

03:47.200 --> 03:49.300
AND A NONDOMINANT MALE
TRIES TO MOUNT HER.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.800
SHE JUST BARES HER FANGS
AND ATTACKS BLINDLY.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.600
THAT STORY
WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE

03:55.600 --> 03:58.200
IF YOU COMPARED YOURSELF
TO THE MALE ORANGUTAN,

03:59.100 --> 04:00.900
AND IF I KNEW
WHAT ESTROUS WAS.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.500
YOU HUNGRY?

04:02.500 --> 04:03.100
OH! OH.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.000
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME
FOR SPILLING THE BEANS.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.700
HE HAD TO FIND OUT SOMEHOW,
RIGHT?

04:08.700 --> 04:12.100
YEAH. SO WHAT ???? 
 I DON'T KNOW. 

04:12.100 --> 04:14.200
WAIT,
TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT,

04:14.200 --> 04:15.800
WHICH IS EASY,
BECAUSE I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO

04:15.800 --> 04:16.800
FOR THIS BENEFIT TONIGHT.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.200
OH, PLEASE, DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT THE BLACK & WHITE BALL.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.500
I HAVE BEEN GLUING CRAP
ONTO THESE THINGS FOR TWO WEEKS.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.400
GLITTER CAME OUT IN MY PEE
YESTERDAY.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.100
YEAH,
BUT IT'S ALL FOR CHARITY,

04:26.100 --> 04:27.900
AND IT'S DANIEL'S
FAVORITE EVENT OF THE YEAR.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.600
HE GETS TO GO UP ONSTAGE
AND PRESENT

04:29.600 --> 04:31.700
THAT GIANT CHECK THINGY.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.600
YEAH, MEN GET EXCITED ABOUT
THINGS LIKE THAT, DON'T THEY?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.300
(bell tinkles)
OH, YAY! THE SANDWICH GUY!

04:41.100 --> 04:42.400
I GOT TOO EXCITED, RIGHT?

04:42.400 --> 04:43.600
WELL, MAYBE.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.800
OKAY, CHICKEN AND CHEESE SPECIAL
ON A BAGUETTE.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.800
NO CHICKEN, NO CHEESE,
NO BAGUETTE.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.900
I JUST SOLD HER
A PLATE OF LETTUCE FOR 7 BUCKS.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.200
<i>YES, BUT THAT'S HER BREAKFAST,
LUNCH AND DINNER,</i>

04:58.200 --> 05:00.100
SO REALLY, IT'S A BARGAIN.
MM.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.500
COULD I PLEASE GET
THE TURKEY SUN-DRIED TOMATO

05:02.500 --> 05:06.500
ON A BAGUETTE, PLEASE?
YES! MAN,
I KNEW YOU WERE AN EATER.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.300
OH. THANK YOU...

05:09.600 --> 05:10.500
I GUESS.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.300
SO YOU'RE NEW.
WHAT HAPPENED TO ROBERT?

05:13.300 --> 05:15.200
YOU KNOW,
I THINK HE INHERITED MONEY...

05:16.000 --> 05:17.200
OR WAS ARRESTED.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.000
OH.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.900
I DON'T KNOW. THERE WAS
A LAWYER AND CASH INVOLVED.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.500
WELL, WELCOME.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.100
HEY, BETTY. CAN YOU GET ME THIS
FOR THE, UH, BENEFIT TONIGHT?

05:29.100 --> 05:31.700
UH, OKAY, YES. THANK YOU.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.300
DANIEL!

05:33.800 --> 05:35.800
THE iBOT
MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR?

05:35.800 --> 05:37.700
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE WALKING BY TODAY

05:37.700 --> 05:39.600
NO, I STILL NEED THERAPY.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.500
I'M
STILL IN A LOT OF PAIN, BETTY.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.500
THANKS.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.600
OK, I KNOW
THAT YOU FEEL REALLY BAD

05:44.600 --> 05:46.900
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
ALEXIS THING...

05:46.900 --> 05:48.600
BUT DO YOU THINK
MAYBE YOUR PAIN

05:48.600 --> 05:50.700
COULD BE MORE EMOTIONAL
THAN PHYSICAL?

05:50.700 --> 05:53.100
MY LEG ISN'T CRYING, BETTY.
IT'S HURTING.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.900
JUST GET ME THE WHEELCHAIR,
OKAY?

05:54.900 --> 05:58.400
OKAY, I'LL JUST ADD IT
TO MY LIST.
OH, AND ABOUT THE CHECK.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.900
CAN YOU, UM, MAKE SURE
THE CHECK IS BIG,

05:59.900 --> 06:02.300
BUT NOT SO BIG IT MAKES
MY HEAD LOOK SMALL?
OKAY.

06:02.300 --> 06:06.500
AND IT SHOULD BE...
(clears throat) BLUE OR GREEN.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.000
BLUE. GOT IT.
SEE, 'CAUSE LAST YEAR,
IT WAS BEIGE,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.200
AND IN ALL THE PHOTOS,
I WAS KINDA WASHED OUT.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.500
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.200
(telephone rings)
DANIEL MEADE'S OFFICE.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.200
<i>FASHION GIVES BACK--</i>

06:17.200 --> 06:19.400
<i>ONCE AGAIN, IT'S
THE "MODE" BLACK & WHITE BALL</i>

06:19.400 --> 06:21.600
<i>BENEFITING
NEW YORK CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.</i>

06:21.600 --> 06:23.600
<i>YES, THE CLOTHES
WILL BE FABULOUS</i>

06:23.600 --> 06:25.800
<i>AND THE KIDS WILL BE SICK.</i>

06:26.600 --> 06:29.500
<i>UNFORTUNATELY, THIS YEAR,
CLAIRE MEADE WILL NOT BE ABLE</i>

06:29.500 --> 06:31.100
<i>TO FULFILL
HER USUAL HOSTESS DUTIES</i>

06:31.100 --> 06:33.800
<i>AS SHE'S ON THE LAM,
WHICH, I UNDERSTAND,</i>

06:33.800 --> 06:36.600
<i>IS WHAT MARIO BATALI
IS SERVING AS THE MAIN COURSE.</i>

06:36.600 --> 06:38.500
<i>BUT IN THE SPIRIT
OF BLACK & WHITE, </i>

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000
<i>THE BALL WILL BE PRESIDED

<i>OR SHOULD I SAY EX-FIANCÉE?</i>

06:45.000 --> 06:47.100
<i>SINCE APPARENTLY, THE WEDDING
HAS BEEN POSTPONED.</i>

06:47.100 --> 06:49.200
<i>TROUBLE IN PARADISE?</i>
TURN IT OFF.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.800
UGH.
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.800
MY CLOSEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD
WILL BE THERE TONIGHT.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.000
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW HAPPY
THIS IS GONNA MAKE THEM?

06:56.000 --> 06:59.200
OH! IT'S JUST
A TEMPORARY SETBACK.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.200
YOU'LL STILL HAVE THE WEDDING
IN A FEW MONTHS.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.100
IF BRADFORD THINKS
HE LOVES YOU NOW,

07:03.100 --> 07:05.600
HE'LL THINK
HE LOVES YOU THEN.
THE LONGER WE WAIT,

07:05.600 --> 07:09.100
THE MORE TIME BRADFORD'S SPAWN
WILL HAVE TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.700
(sighs)
I'M DONE, MARC. IT'S OVER.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.300
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME, LADY.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.800
THE WILHELMINA SLATER I KNOW
AND OCCASIONALLY WISH I WAS

07:15.800 --> 07:17.000
DOES NOT THROW IN THE TOWEL

07:17.000 --> 07:18.500
JUST BECAUSE
THE OLD MAN SHE'S SCAMMING

07:18.500 --> 07:21.700
<i>HAS SUDDENLY GONE ALL SOFT
FOR HIS TRAMNESIAC DAUGHTER.</i>

07:21.700 --> 07:22.700
YOU'RE TOUCHING ME.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.900
IT WAS A RISK.
OH.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.300
I JUST DIDN'T COUNT ON
THE FATHER/DAUGHTER REBONDING.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.700
I HATE THAT LOVE WON OUT.
WELL, MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULD
REMIND DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL

07:30.700 --> 07:32.300
THAT SHE HATES DADDY,
AND THAT SHE SPENT

07:32.300 --> 07:34.400
THE LAST TWO YEARS
TRYING TO BRING HIM DOWN.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.700
WAIT A MINUTE.
AAH!

07:38.900 --> 07:41.200
OH, DID I SAY SOMETHING SMART?
I LOVE IT WHEN I DO THAT.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.600
HOW ARE YOU AT PHOTOSHOP?
A-MAH-ZING.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.300
I'M ABOUT TO REWRITE HISTORY.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.700
THIS SURE BEATS A 40-OUNCE.

07:50.700 --> 07:53.500
THE WEDDING'S POSTPONED.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

07:53.500 --> 07:56.500
WILHELMINA IS LOSING
HER GRIP ON BRADFORD.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.200
WHY WE GOTTA TALK ABOUT HIM
DURING FAMILY TIME?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.200
I MADE THIS RUM PUNCH
OUT OF POMEGRANATE.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.500
THERE AIN'T NO MORE GUAVA.

08:03.500 --> 08:07.200
YOGA, PLEASE. IF I'M EVER
GOING TO GET HIM BACK, IT'S NOW.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.200
I'VE GOT TO GO
TO THAT BALL TONIGHT.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.400
I'VE GOT TO TALK TO HIM.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.500
YOU A WANTED FELON.
CINDERELLA CAN'T GO TO NO BALL.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.700
SHE CAN
IF IT'S A MASKED BALL.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.700
OH, HEY! UH,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.500
THERE'S JUST A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH MY SANDWICH.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.300
OH, MAN. IS THERE A HAIR?

08:29.600 --> 08:32.400
I'M, LIKE, THE ONLY ONE LEFT
IN MY FAMILY WITH A FULL HEAD.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.799
UH, NO. IT'S JUST THAT THERE ARE
ONLY THREE SUN-DRIED TOMATOES.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.000
YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW.
I MADE IT.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.200
OH, OKAY.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.600
UH, IT'S JUST THAT ROBERT
WOULD ALWAYS PUT MORE,

08:44.000 --> 08:44.600
SO...

08:46.400 --> 08:48.300
SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ROBERT IS.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.600
I'M NOT HIS KEEPER, OKAY?

08:49.600 --> 08:52.300
BUT ROBERT DIDN'T KNOW JACK
ABOUT FOOD.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.600
A SUN-DRIED TOMATO
IS A CONCENTRATED FLAVOR.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.400
MORE THAN THREE
ON A SANDWICH

08:56.400 --> 08:58.800
WOULD OVERWHELM
THE SMOKY FLAVOR OF THE TURKEY.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.300
OKAY, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK MY TURKEY CAN HANDLE IT.

09:02.300 --> 09:05.400
SO COULD I JUST PLEASE HAVE
SOME MORE SUN-DRIED TOMATOES?

09:07.000 --> 09:07.900
NAH.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.400
IT WOULD BE WRONG.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.500
I-I WANT MY SANDWICH
THE WAY I WANT MY SANDWICH.

09:13.000 --> 09:13.800
WOW.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.800
(chuckles) YOU KNOW,
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU,

09:18.100 --> 09:19.900
I THOUGHT, "WOW. THERE GOES
A GIRL FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.200
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?"

09:21.700 --> 09:25.200
NOW I SEE YOU'RE JUST LIKE ALL
THE OTHER SPOILED "MODE" GIRLS.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.400
NO. NO, I'M NOT!

09:28.400 --> 09:29.800
YOU KNOW, I BET
BEFORE YOU GOT HERE,

09:29.800 --> 09:32.200
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A SUN-DRIED TOMATO WAS.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.800
YOU JUST REACHED INTO THE CART

09:33.800 --> 09:36.400
AND PULLED OUT WHATEVER
HAD THE MOST CHEESE.
I...

09:36.700 --> 09:38.200
I STILL EAT CHEESE.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.200
I MEAN, HOW DARE HE ACT
LIKE HE KNOWS WHO I AM?

09:41.200 --> 09:43.600
AND WH-WHY DO I EVEN HAVE
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF?

09:43.600 --> 09:47.800
OKAY, BETTY, NOT REALLY SURE
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.500
SUN-DRIED TOMATOES,
REALLY?

09:49.500 --> 09:52.700
I MEAN, DON'T YOU FIND THEM
KIND OF SALTY AND BREATHY?

09:52.700 --> 09:54.700
NO, IT'S NOT JUST THAT.
IT'S...

09:55.500 --> 09:57.300
I MEAN,
HE WAS SO RUDE TO ME.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.300
BETTY, YOU NEED
TO CALM DOWN, OKAY?

09:59.300 --> 10:01.600
I MEAN, GO ONLINE TO THAT--
THAT WEB SITE YOU LIKE.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.800
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE WITH THE BABY DUCKS

10:02.800 --> 10:04.200
WHO THINK THE CAT'S
THEIR MOTHER?

10:04.200 --> 10:07.500
socuteitssick.com--
I LOVE THAT WEB SITE.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.300
EXCEPT ONE OF THE BABY DUCKS
IS MISSING.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.200
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT IS THIS GUY'S NAME?

10:14.200 --> 10:15.300
I DON'T KNOW.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.600
SOMETHING LAME, LIKE GIO.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.800
Come back for what?

10:21.800 --> 10:23.700
For a chance to run.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.700
<i>HEY, PAPI.
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING?</i>

10:26.700 --> 10:28.800
SEÑOR DELGADO'S
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.000
DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA KILL HIM?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.300
LET'S HOPE NOT.
(gun cocks)

10:31.600 --> 10:33.100
HEY, DID YOU BOOK
YOUR FLIGHT YET?

10:33.100 --> 10:37.300
NOT YET. I JUST WANTED
TO CALL AND SAY...

10:38.800 --> 10:39.600
I LOVE YOU ALL.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.300
<i>AY. YOU'RE SUCH
A NERVOUS FLYER.</i>

10:41.300 --> 10:44.400
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
OOH, IT IS GETTING GOOD.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.700
OKAY, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
LOVE YOU, BYE.

10:47.800 --> 10:52.200
YOU SEE? I'M NOT SUCH A MONSTER.
I LET YOU SAY GOOD-BYE.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.700
AT LEAST TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.900
WHO ARE YOU?
(door opens)

10:57.200 --> 10:59.000
(man) I THINK YOU KNOW
MY FATHER.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.500
RAMIRO VASQUEZ.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.400
IT SEEMS YOU DID NOT KILL ME
AFTER ALL.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.900
UH, NO,
FRIDAY DOESN'T REALLY HELP ME.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.300
I REALLY NEED TO GET
THE WHEELCHAIR HERE TONIGHT.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.400
WELL, THIS THING
CAN WALK AND TALK.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.600
CAN'T YOU JUST STICK IT
ON THE TURNPIKE

11:23.600 --> 11:26.000
AND GIVE IT MONEY FOR TOLLS?
THANK YOU.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
OKAY,
SO YOU DON'T GET SARCASM.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.500
COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST HOLD IT FOR ME,

11:29.500 --> 11:31.400
AND I-I PROMISE
I WILL FIND A WAY TO--

11:31.400 --> 11:34.500
<i>WELL, YOU MUST BE HAPPY</i>

11:34.500 --> 11:37.300
UM, I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
WHY?

11:37.300 --> 11:39.200
I JUST GOT FIRED

11:39.200 --> 11:41.700
<i>BECAUSE YOU WENT CRYING
TO YOUR BOSS.</i>

11:41.700 --> 11:43.200
NOW I DON'T HAVE A JOB.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.600
OH, MAN. I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GO BACK TO STEALING CABLE

11:46.600 --> 11:49.800
FROM MY NEIGHBOR,
WHICH I DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT,

11:50.600 --> 11:52.700
ALL BECAUSE
SOME LITTLE "MODE" GIRL

11:52.700 --> 11:54.300
WASN'T HAPPY
WITH HER SANDWICH.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.900
NO, LOOK, I WASN'T TRYING
TO GET YOU FIRED. I WAS JUST--

11:56.900 --> 11:58.900
YEAH, WELL,
NONETHELESS, YOU DID.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.500
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
THAT'S IT FOR ME,

12:04.400 --> 12:06.000
BUT BEFORE I GO,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.700
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS FAT-FREE MAYO.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.100
THERE'S 125 CALORIES OF PURE FAT
PER TABLESPOON,

12:15.100 --> 12:17.800
<i>AND I PUT TWO IN EVERY SANDWICH.</i>

12:17.800 --> 12:18.600
OOH!

12:20.700 --> 12:22.100
SEE YOU AROUND,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.200
"MODE" GIRL.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.300
(Marc) NICE, BETTY.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.400
YOU'RE FINALLY ONE OF US.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.000
NO.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.400
NO, I'M NOT ONE OF YOU.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.500
WILHELMINA, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO GO TO THIS MUCH TROUBLE.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.100
WELL, SOMEONE'S GOTTA TEACH YOU
HOW TO BE A WOMAN AGAIN.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.200
(sighs) IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.000
IT'S LIKE I FINALLY GOT
THE SPORTS CAR I ALWAYS WANTED,

13:09.000 --> 13:10.800
BUT I FORGOT
HOW TORIVE A STICK.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.300
OR MAYBE IN THIS CASE,
IT'S MORE LIKE AN AUTOMATIC.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.400
DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE NOT GOING
THROUGH TH ALONE.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.000
I'M HERE. THAT'S WHAT
BEST FRIENDS ARE FOR.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.800
IT'S SO CRAZY. I CAN'T
REMEMBER OUR FRIENDSHIP.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.100
WELL, THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT THIS.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.900
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
GIRLS, COME ON. OFF, OFF.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.100
SHE'S A TRANNY,
NOT A DRAG QUEEN. LET'S GO.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.000
<i>(woman) DR. FISHMAN
TO RADIOLOGY.</i>

13:31.800 --> 13:33.900
I HAVE PICTURES
OF ALL KINDS OF FUN

13:33.900 --> 13:35.600
THE TWO OF US HAD
THE PAST YEAR.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.900
MAYBE IT'LL JOG YOUR MEMORY.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.900
OH, HERE WE ARE
AT FASHION WEEK,

13:42.900 --> 13:45.100
AND THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY.
YOU MADE ME DRINK

13:45.100 --> 13:48.200
SOMETHING CALLED
AN IRISH CAR BOMB.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.300
MM. I HAD A HANGOVER
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.500
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.000
SORRY. I GUESS A BIT OF ALEX
MUST HAVE SLIPPED IN THERE.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.400
OH.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.100
WE SQUARE DANCE?

14:03.300 --> 14:04.900
WOW. I DON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF THIS.

14:04.900 --> 14:08.000
OH, UH, APPARENTLY,
WE LOVE TO DO-SI-DO.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.700
AND HERE WE ARE...
MARCHING FOR GAY RIGHTS.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.300
SO ARE WE...

14:17.300 --> 14:19.100
NO, NO. JUST POLITICAL.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.400
I REALLY HAVE TO GO. I NEED
TO CHECK ON YOUR FATHER.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.400
I HOPE HE'S GOTTEN
OUT OF BED TODAY.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.000
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG?
IS HE SICK?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.700
NO, NO, NO. IT'S...
IT'S--IT'S NOTHING.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.200
JUST FORGET
I SAID ANYTHING.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.900
BESIDES,
BRADFORD WOULD KILL ME.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.200
WILHELMINA,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.200
I MEAN,
WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

14:40.700 --> 14:42.200
BEST FRIENDS.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.000
GOD. I HAVE MISSED
TALKING TO YOU.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.900
LOOK, I'M REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

14:48.900 --> 14:52.000
HE'S BEEN DEVASTATED SINCE
HE POSTPONED HIS WEDDING.

14:52.000 --> 14:52.800
WHAT?

14:53.100 --> 14:55.300
HE'S GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?
TO WHO?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.000
TO YOUR...

14:58.000 --> 14:59.300
BEST FRIEND.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.400
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF BUMMED
MR. MEADE'S NOT MY FATHER.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.400
I MEAN,
HE IS RICH AND BALD.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.000
(gasps)
YOUR DADDY WARBUCKS FANTASY.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.800
I DON'T KNOW
WHY THAT'S SO STRONG.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.100
OKAY, CAN WE FORGET AND FOCUS ON YOUR MOTHER

15:14.100 --> 15:17.300
AND WHAT BEING FEY SOMMERS'
DAUGHTER CAN GET US?

15:17.300 --> 15:20.100
AND BY "US," I MEAN YOU,
AND BY "YOU," I MEAN ME.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.800
THINK ABOUT IT--
THE INVITES, THE SWAG.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.100
(gasps) YOU ARE RIGHT.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.600
I AM FREAKIN'
FEY SOMMERS' DAUGHTER.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.500
AND... GENIUS IDEA.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.100
YOUR COMING-OUT PARTY

15:32.100 --> 15:34.500
IS TONIGHT
AT THE BLACK & WHITE BALL.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.000
YAY!
(gasps) IT IS?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
IT'S PERFECT.
THIS WAS FEY'S BIG EVENT.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.600
EVERY YEAR, SHE WOULD ARRIVE
IN SOME FABULOUS RED GOWN

15:41.600 --> 15:43.200
AND UTTER HER FAMOUS LINES...

15:43.200 --> 15:44.700
(imitates Fey)
"BLACK & WHITE BALL?

15:45.300 --> 15:47.300
I GUESS
I DIDN'T GET THE MEMO."

15:47.800 --> 15:49.300
I CAN TOTALLY DO THAT.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.700
AND WHEN YOU ARRIVE
HOLDING HER UGLY MUTT,

15:51.700 --> 15:53.800
THERE WILL
BE A MEDIA FEEDING FRENZY,

15:53.800 --> 15:57.100
AND I WILL BE RIGHT THERE
TO FEAST ON WHATEVER SCRAPS

15:57.100 --> 15:59.200
ARE LEFT AFTER THEY'RE DONE
WITH YOUR CARCASS.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.100
NOPE. TOO ANGRY.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.300
CALM DOWN, HENRY.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.400
(Marc)
HEY, GRUBSTINK!

16:11.400 --> 16:13.300
GRUBSTINK!
WE NEED OUR CHECKS EARLY.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.700
YEAH, I GOTTA BUY ME
A RED DRESS, GRUBSTANK.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.400
IT'S GRUBSTICK.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.200
<i>(pounds desk)
GRUBSTICK. GOT IT?</i>

16:20.200 --> 16:22.600
IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST
AND MOST HONORED NAMES

16:22.600 --> 16:25.300
IN DUTCH HISTORY,
WHICH LOOSELY TRANSLATES TO,

16:25.300 --> 16:27.500
"HE WHO GIVES THE FAIREST PRICE
FOR HIS BRICKS."

16:27.500 --> 16:32.200
<i>THE NAME IS VENERATED, AND I AM
PROUD TO BE A GRUBSTICK.</i>

16:35.100 --> 16:36.400
DID HE JUST GET
REALLY HOT?

16:36.400 --> 16:39.000
I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE ATTRACTED
TO ANYONE IN MY LIFE.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.300
CHARLIE, THIS IS HENRY.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.700
CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU GET THIS.
WE NEED TO TALK.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.500
HEY, JUSTIN.
HOW YOU DOING?

17:09.500 --> 17:10.400
OKAY.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.900
BEEN HAVING KIND OF
A TOUGH TIME LATELY, HUH?

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
I GUESS.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.200
DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO PLAY BASKETBALL?

17:22.300 --> 17:23.099
SURE.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.000
BACK AT HARVARD, THEY USED TO
CALL ME DR. SWISH.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.300
IT'S JUST
A BASKETBALL TERM.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.500
WHY DO YOU ASK?

17:30.500 --> 17:32.200
I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.000
REALLY? BASKETBALL?

17:35.300 --> 17:36.700
MY DAD LOVED IT.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.300
THIS WAS HIS.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.000
COME ON.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.100
LET'S GO SHOOT SOME HOOPS.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.200
WAIT. SANDWICH GUY!
OH, MAN.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.400
GIO! LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY,

17:53.400 --> 17:54.700
BUT I JUST FINISHED TALKING
TO YOUR BOSS,

17:54.700 --> 17:56.100
AND YOU CAN
HAVE YOUR JOB BACK.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.700
WOW. THAT WAS...
THAT WAS NICE OF YOU.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.700
SEE? I'M NOT A "MODE" GIRL.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.700
A "MODE" GIRL
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.200
YEAH, I GUESS NOT,
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.500
I DON'T WANT IT BACK.

18:09.900 --> 18:10.700
WHY?

18:10.700 --> 18:11.800
BECAUSE LOSING THAT JOB

18:11.800 --> 18:14.100
WAS EXACTLY THE KICK
IN THE BUTT I NEEDED.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.600
IT WAS TAKING ME AWAY
FROM MY 5-YEAR PLAN.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.300
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FIVE YEARS?

18:18.300 --> 18:21.300
TO START MY OWN PLACE,
YOU KNOW?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.000
GIO'S SANDWICH DEPOT.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.400
300 SEATS, A THOUSAND KINDS
OF SANDWICHES

18:26.400 --> 18:28.300
AND THE WORLD'S LONGEST
CONDIMENT BAR.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.900
YOU NAME IT, IT'S ON THERE.
GO AHEAD. NAME ONE.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.800
UM... MUSTARD?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.200
OF COURSE THERE'S GONNA
BE MUSRD THERE.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.600
COME ON.
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
SORRY.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.000
????

18:39.000 --> 18:40.600
GIO'S COULD BE HUGE.

18:40.600 --> 18:45.100
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I
STILL FEEL KIND OF GUILTY

18:46.100 --> 18:47.500
ABOUT GETTING YOU FIRED.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.700
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

18:48.700 --> 18:49.500
WELL...

18:51.700 --> 18:52.900
SOMETHING WILL TURN UP.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.100
HEY!

19:01.400 --> 19:02.000
(Betty) WAIT!

19:02.500 --> 19:04.700
YOU HAVE A VAN.
WE NEED A VAN.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.200
WOULD YOU DRIVE ME TO NEW JERSEY
TO PICK UP A WHEELCHAIR?

19:07.200 --> 19:10.000
WE'D PAY YOU.
SURE, I COULD DO THAT.

19:10.000 --> 19:10.800
GET IN.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.000
SAUERKRAUT?

19:20.700 --> 19:22.100
DON'T EMBARRASS YOURSELF.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.500
MY FATHER LEFT MY MOM FOR YOU?

19:26.500 --> 19:28.900
OH, THIS MEMORY LOSS
MUST BE FRUSTRATING.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.100
CLAIRE IS THE ONE
THAT LEFT YOUR FATHER.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.600
AND YOU WERE RIGHT THERE to move in.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.900
WELL, IT--
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.300
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE THERE FOR HIM--

19:37.300 --> 19:38.900
A SHOULDER TO LEAN ON,

19:38.900 --> 19:40.700
SOMEONE TO BRING HIM SOUP--

19:40.700 --> 19:44.100
AND I NEVER COULD HAVE PREDICTED
THAT WE'D FALL IN LOVE,

19:45.300 --> 19:46.200
BUT WE DID.

19:46.200 --> 19:49.300
WELL, IF HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH,
WHY'D HEALL OFF THE WEDDING?

19:49.300 --> 19:51.600
BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU MORE.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.100
WITH THE ACCIDENT AND ALL,
HE DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.000
I JUST HOPE HIS...

19:56.900 --> 19:58.500
HIS HEART CAN TAKE IT.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.700
WILHELMINA, WAIT.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.100
THAT WAS QUITE A BEATING YOU
GAVE ME ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.100
<i>AS I REMEMBER, IT WAS TO PROTECT
ROSA FROM ONE OF YOUR BEATINGS.</i>

20:17.100 --> 20:19.600
SHE WAS MY WIFE.
I HAD THE RIGHT.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.100
<i>GET YOUR FEET DOWN,
YOU ANIMAL!
AY! AAH!</i>

20:22.400 --> 20:24.700
MY COOK RAN AWAY
WITH MY WIFE.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.500
YOU HUMILIATED ME.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.900
THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME
GOING THROUGH THE YEARS

20:28.900 --> 20:33.500
WAS THE HOPE THAT...
MAYBE ONE DAY...

20:35.500 --> 20:37.200
I COULD HAVE MY REVENGE.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.300
IT SEEMS
THAT DAY HAS COME.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.300
SO YOU WANT ME DEAD?

20:42.600 --> 20:43.800
PERHAPS.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.500
BUT RIGHT NOW,

20:46.600 --> 20:47.900
I WANT MY FLAN.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.600
YOUR FLAN?

20:50.600 --> 20:51.700
YOUR BEST DESSERT.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.500
SOMETIMES I WAKE UP,
AND I MISS MY WIFE.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.600
SOMETIMES I MISS MY FLAN.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.100
YOU'RE INSANE.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.200
NO.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.600
JUST HUNGRY.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.000
YOU'LL MAKE YOUR FLAN...

21:07.800 --> 21:09.500
MAYBE I SPARE YOUR LIFE.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.800
REMEMBER THAT. ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN DO THIS. LET'S SHOOT.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.700
BUT YOU'RE DRIBBLING
WITH ONE HAND, RIGHT? NOT TWO.
OKAY.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.800
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU WANNA
STEP OFF WITH YOUR LEFT,

21:21.800 --> 21:23.700
BOUNCE IT IN WITH YOUR RIGHT,
OKAY?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.300
ALL RIGHT, ONE HANDED.

21:27.900 --> 21:31.000
(man) OH, NICE, NICE.
OKAY, LET'S TRY AGAIN.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.300
MAYBE LOSE THE BRACELETS,
I DON'T KNOW.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.100
COME ON, JUSTIN.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.400
WE CAN DO THIS.
YOU JUST GOTTA CONCENTRATE.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.100
(Daniel) ONE HAND, JUSTIN.
(Justin) I CAN'T.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.500
JUSTIN, YOU HAVE
TO VISUALIZE, OKAY?

21:57.500 --> 21:59.600
OKAY, SO LINE IT UP
AND MAKE THE SHOT.

22:00.900 --> 22:01.800
LEFT FOOT.
(grunts)

22:03.000 --> 22:04.900
NO, NO, NO.
HERE, JUST WATCH ME.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.000
YOU CAN WALK?

22:15.400 --> 22:18.300
UH... BASKETBALL MIRACLE.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.000
TAKE IT, BETTY.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.300
UH, MM...

22:31.300 --> 22:35.800
(off- key) * T-THE HURT
YOU CAUSED WHEN YOU WALKED *
AHEM. THAT'S A...

22:35.800 --> 22:38.800
(turns off radio)
THAT'S A REALLY HARD SONG
TO SING.

22:39.300 --> 22:41.400
SO TELL ME,
IF YOU'RE NOT A "MODE" GIRL,

22:41.400 --> 22:43.900
THEN WHY DO YOU WORK THERE?
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.800
IT'S GONNA OPEN
A LOT OF DOORS FOR ME.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.300
I WANT TO HAVE
A MAGAZINE OF MY OWN ONE DAY.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.500
AH. HOW--
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.600
I'M AN ASSISTANT NOW, BUT THEN
I WANT TO BE WRITING FOR ONE.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.700
YOU'RE A WRITER?
MM-HMM.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.300
THAT'S COOL.
WHAT HAVE YOU WRITTEN?

22:58.800 --> 22:59.700
A LO

22:59.700 --> 23:02.900
ACTUALLY, I PRACTICALLY RAN
THE QUEENS COLLEGE NEWSPAPER,

23:02.900 --> 23:05.800
BUT SINCE I'VE LEFT,
THE QUALITY HAS GONE WAY DOWN.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.100
NO, I MEAN LATELY.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.100
UH, WELL... (sighs)

23:10.500 --> 23:13.700
NOTHING REALLY, BUT I DO
HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS.

23:13.700 --> 23:16.000
GOOD.
KEEPING IT ALL UP THERE.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.500
THAT'S HOW HEMINGWAY DID IT.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.300
HE WAS THINKING,
"WHAT A NICE MORNING,"

23:20.400 --> 23:23.700
AND "THE SUN ALSO RISES" JUST
MAGICALLY APPEARED ON THE PAGE.

23:23.700 --> 23:24.700
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

23:24.700 --> 23:27.500
NO, NO, NO. I'M SORRY.
I JUST, YOU KNOW,

23:27.500 --> 23:29.200
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
ONE OF THESE PEOPLE

23:29.200 --> 23:31.900
WHO JUST WAITS
FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN.
NO.

23:31.900 --> 23:34.100
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU,
LIKE, 30 NOW?

23:34.800 --> 23:36.400
I'M 23.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.200
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.400
HOW ABOUT YOU WORRY
ABOUT DRIVING? OKAY?

23:53.600 --> 23:55.500
(scoffs) YOU'RE FAKING IT
TO MEET GIRLS?

23:55.500 --> 23:58.500
IT'S THIS ONE GIRL.
SHE'S MY NEW PHYSICAL THERAPIST.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.700
SHE IS JUST--
SHE'S SO TOTALLY...

24:02.300 --> 24:03.200
SMART.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.200
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOUR AUNT BETTY, DO WE?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.900
SHE ALREADY THINKS
I'M A TOTAL SCREWUP.

24:07.900 --> 24:11.600
I PROMISE I WILL HAVE
A TOTAL RECOVERY NEXT WEEK,

24:11.600 --> 24:13.100
JUST AS SOON
AS I'VE HAD ONE,

24:13.100 --> 24:17.200
UH, REALLY SMART CONVERSATION
WITH HER. DEAL?

24:18.100 --> 24:19.700
YOU'RE KIND OF A DOG.

24:21.300 --> 24:22.100
I AM.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.100
YOU REMIND ME OF MY DAD.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.400
NOW THIS MACHINE HAS TO COME
BACK IN PRISTINE CONDITION.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.400
YOU GOT IT? PRISTINE.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.100
HOW DO I WANT IT BACK?

24:34.100 --> 24:35.800
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE PERFECT.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.200
(quietly) I THINK HE WANTED YOU
TO SAY "PRISTINE."

24:38.600 --> 24:39.400
PRISTINE.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
NOW JUST ONE SECOND.

24:43.500 --> 24:44.200
THIS...

24:44.200 --> 24:46.000
THIS ISN'T
THE iBOT WE RESERVED.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.400
YEAH. NICK LACHEY'S PEOPLE
JUST CALLED.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.800
HE TWISTED HIS ANKLE
IN A GYROTONICS CLASS.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.800
PROBABLY DIDN'T STRETC
ANYWAY, WE'RE GIVING IT TO HIM.

24:53.800 --> 24:57.500
BUT... BUT...
MY BOSS WANTED THE iBOT.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.800
YEAH, SAD STORY.
YOU'RE GETTING THIS ONE.
(cell phone rings)

25:01.200 --> 25:02.000
HELLO?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.100
BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR.
(man) YEAH.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.700
WE RESERVED THE iBOT.
WE PAID FOR IT,

25:06.700 --> 25:09.600
AND HE'S GIVING US
THE... TULIP?

25:10.700 --> 25:12.300
DANIEL CAN'T RIDE
A TULIP.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.700
GIVE HIM A GOOD REASON
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.500
COME ON.
YOU'RE A WRITER.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.400
MAKE UP A GOOD STORY.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.400
(man) WE'LL DELIVER IT
TOMORROW.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.500
EXCUSE ME.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.500
YEAH,
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.300
SIR?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.600
UM, LOOK, I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE TALKING ABOUT THIS,

25:32.400 --> 25:34.900
BUT MY BOSS WORKS
FOR THE C.I.A.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.900
YEAH, AND WE REALLY NEED
THAT CHAIR.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.600
HOW COULD HE HAVE BELIEVED
THAT CRAZY STORY?

25:41.600 --> 25:43.700
'CAUSE IT WAS GOOD.

25:43.700 --> 25:45.200
WELL, I Y HAVE BORROWED
A LITTLE OF IT

25:45.200 --> 25:47.900
FROM "CASINO ROYALE,"
BUT I DID PUT MY OWN SPIN ON IT.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.200
HELLS YEAH, YOU DID.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.000
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU ARE
A WRITER AFTER ALL.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.900
THANKS. MAYBE I AM.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.400
WAIT A MINUTE.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.100
IS THIS REAL?

26:03.500 --> 26:06.300
AM I PINNING
AN ENDANGERED SPECIES HERE?

26:06.300 --> 26:07.700
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO FEEL BAD,

26:07.700 --> 26:09.600
I HAVE A HAT
MADE OF BALD EAGLE.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.100
(singsongy) GUESS WHO JUST
CALLED BRADFORD TO HER BEDSIDE.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.400
TOOK HERONG ENOUGH.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.300
LOOKS LIKE SHE'LL BE GIVING
HER BLESSING FOR THIS WEDDING

26:17.300 --> 26:19.200
WITHIN THE HOUR.

26:19.200 --> 26:23.800
PERFECT. EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO MY PLAN.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.300
(gasps) SOFT.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.000
OH! HARD.
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.300
SQUARE DANCING.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.200
BETTER THAN I REMEMBER.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.400
KILL HIM ANYWAY.

26:54.600 --> 26:55.800
THIS ONE ALMOST WENT IN,

26:55.800 --> 26:58.000
BUT I TOUCHED SOMETHING GROSS
ON THE POLE.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.700
WOW, HONEY. GOOD FOR YOU

27:01.700 --> 27:04.200
SO...
THIS BASKETBALL THING--

27:04.200 --> 27:06.200
THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING FOR, UM,

27:06.200 --> 27:07.000
A LITTLE WHILE?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.600
YEAH. I LIKE IT,
AND I THINK I'M GETTING BETTER.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.000
(glass shatters)
(Justin) OH!

27:11.600 --> 27:13.600
YEAH, DEFINITELY.
I CAN SEE THAT.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.900
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.800
I THOUGHT DANIEL WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE IN A WHEELCHAIR.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.300
DANIEL, IT'S BETTY AGAIN.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.400
WE GOT YOU YOUR CHAIR,
BUT IT'S ALMOST 7:00,

27:28.400 --> 27:29.700
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO MEET US HERE.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.000
AND I'VE GOT
THE LINT ROLLER,

27:31.000 --> 27:32.500
SO I'LL JUST GO OVER YOU
WHEN YOU GET HERE.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.000
(laughs) MAN.

27:34.900 --> 27:35.700
WHAT?

27:35.700 --> 27:38.000
YOU KNOW, I THINK I KNOW
THE REASON WHY YOU DON'T WRITE.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.500
YOU'RE TOO BUSY
DE-LINTING YOUR BOSS' ASS.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.300
SEE, NO.
I DIDN'T SAY THE "A" WORD,

27:42.300 --> 27:43.900
AND MY JOB
DOESN'T JUST CONSIST

27:43.900 --> 27:45.000
OF SILLY LITTLE THINGS
LIKE THAT.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.300
I HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT
RESPONSIBILITIES.

27:49.700 --> 27:50.700
EXCUSE ME. WHAT IS THAT?

27:50.700 --> 27:52.500
THAT--THE CHECK
ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THAT BIG,

27:52.500 --> 27:54.200
AND WE ASKED FOR IT TO BE BLUE.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.100
HOW IS THAT GONNA LOOK
NEXT TO DANIEL'S TINY PALE HEAD?
(laughs)

27:59.100 --> 28:01.300
STOP LAUGHING AT ME.

28:01.300 --> 28:04.200
AND NOT THAT
IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

28:04.200 --> 28:05.900
BUT I WILL GET BACK
TO MY WRITING.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.900
(Gio) I'M SURE YOU WILL.
I WILL.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.800
I JUST DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME RIGHT NOW

28:09.800 --> 28:12.500
BECAUSE I'M GOING THROUGH
SOME HUGE FAMILY PROBLEMS.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.300
QUACK.
EXCUSE ME?

28:14.300 --> 28:17.500
EVERY TIME YOU MAKE AN EXCUSE,
I'M GONNA QUACK.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.300
YOU... YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO QUACK.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.600
YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.800
MY DAD IS STUCK IN MEXICO.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.600
QUACK.
NO, SERIOUSLY,
AND MY SISTER'S FIANCÉ--

28:27.600 --> 28:29.700
QUACK. QUACK.
WILL YOU JUST LET ME FINISH?

28:29.700 --> 28:31.700
QUACK. ALL EXCUSES.

28:31.700 --> 28:34.000
THE PROBLEM IS
YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.700
YOU GO THROUGH LIFE--
WOOF!

28:36.200 --> 28:37.400
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

28:37.400 --> 28:38.500
WELL, IF YOU'RE GONNA QUACK,
THEN I'M GONNA WOOF

28:38.500 --> 28:40.900
EVERY TIME YOU MENTION
YOUR STUPID PLAN.

28:41.700 --> 28:42.700
QUACK.

28:42.700 --> 28:45.000
NO, QUACKING.
THAT WASN'T AN EXCUSE.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.700
YEAH, WELL,
I CHANGED THE RULES.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.400
QUACK! QUACK!

28:48.400 --> 28:50.600
WOOF! WOOF! WOOF!
WOOF! WOOF!
QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!

28:50.600 --> 28:51.400
YOUR PHONE'S RINGING.

28:53.700 --> 28:54.900
WOOF! HELLO?

28:56.900 --> 28:57.700
HILDA.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.300
WHAT? HE CAN WALK?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.200
WHAT'S BLACK AND WHITE
AND RICH ALL OVER?

29:11.200 --> 29:13.800
WHY, THE GUESTS
AT "MODE'S" BLACK & WHITE BALL

29:13.800 --> 29:16.400
BENEFITING THE CHILDREN'S
HOSPITAL OF BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,

29:16.400 --> 29:17.200
LIKE IT MATTERS.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.300
LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT EVA MENDES IS WEARING.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.600
FORGET EVA MENDES.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.800
IS THAT FEY SOMMERS'
ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER,

29:22.800 --> 29:24.700
AMANDA TANEN? (mouths words)

29:33.700 --> 29:37.200
BLACK & WHITE BALL?
I GUS I DIDN'T GET THE MEMO.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.600
(woman) IS THAT ZAC EFRON?

29:38.600 --> 29:40.300
(man) ZAC! THAT IS HIM.

29:41.700 --> 29:42.700
LOUDER.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.300
(woman) RIGHT HERE!
RIGHT HERE! RIGHT HERE!

29:46.100 --> 29:47.800
BLACK & WHITE BALL?

29:47.800 --> 29:50.100
I GUESS I DIDN'T GET THE MEMO.
(mouths words)

29:50.100 --> 29:53.300
HEY, THAT'S FEY SOMMERS'...
DOG.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.100
HI.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.900
I'M FEY SOMMERS' DAUGHTER.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.600
YEAH. CAN I GET A WATER?
TODAY.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.200
I DIDN'T GET THE MEMO.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.100
UGH. THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.600
THEY TOOK PICTURES
OF THE WRONG BITCH.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.200
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.????

30:10.200 --> 30:12.800
I WAS NAIVE TO THINK THAT THE PRESS
WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CARE.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.000
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK
FOR YOUR CELEBRITY.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.500
DOES PARIS HILTON HAVE
EVERYTHING HANDED TO HER?

30:16.500 --> 30:18.000
WELL, ACTUALLY, SHE DOES,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.900
<i>BUT THAT CELEB-UTARD
WORKS HARD TO STAY IN THE NEWS.</i>

30:22.200 --> 30:24.900
YOU'RE RIGHT. I HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.600
SHOULD I DO SKANKY? 'CAUSE I
COULD TOTALLY DO SKANKY.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.100
WHAT IF I JUST GO PEE
ON THE CARPET?

30:28.100 --> 30:30.100
OH, SWEETIE, COURTNEY LOVE DID ???

30:30.100 --> 30:32.700
NO, IT'S GOTTA BE BIGGER.
YOU'VE GOT TO OUT-LOHAN LOHAN,

30:32.700 --> 30:34.900
OUT-BRITNEY BRITNEY.
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.100
YES, THERE IS.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.700
OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT JOSH DUHAMEL?

30:40.700 --> 30:41.700
WHERE?

30:42.500 --> 30:43.400
JOSH! (giggles)

30:44.100 --> 30:45.000
JOSH!

30:46.500 --> 30:47.400
JOSH! (giggles)

30:52.500 --> 30:53.400
(man) HEY!
(man) WHOA!

30:55.100 --> 30:56.000
YEAH. THERE YOU GO.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.100
MICHAEL BOLTON.
NOT THE GOOD ONE.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.500
OH. HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO MEET YOU.

31:23.800 --> 31:27.100
BRADFORD MEADE,
YOU'RE ENGAGED TO HIM.
OH, DARLING. MM.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.000
TELL ME, HOW'S OUR ALEXIS DOING?
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.900
IT SEEMS SOMEONE
TOLD HER ABOUT US.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.600
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO,

31:33.600 --> 31:34.700
BUT SHE'S A SMART GIRL,

31:34.700 --> 31:36.600
EVEN WITH SOME OF
HER BRAIN MISSING.

31:36.600 --> 31:37.900
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.400
SHE'S NOW COMPLETELY ONBOARD
WITH THE WEDDING.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.500
SHE IS?
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

31:42.500 --> 31:43.600
YEAH, I WAS SURPRISED, TOO.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.700
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY CLOSE
TO CLAIRE.

31:45.700 --> 31:48.000
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT CLOSE
TO CLAIRE. HERE.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.900
(Bradford)
I'M NOT WEARING THAT THING.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.200
THIS IS A BAD IDEA,
FISH.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.500
I HAVE TO SEE BRADFORD.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.100
BLACK & WHITE BALL, HUH?

31:57.100 --> 31:59.100
THIS LOOKS LIKE
AN ALL-WHITE BALL TO ME.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.300
COME ON.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.600
OH!
THIS WHEELCHAIR IS SEXY!

32:05.600 --> 32:08.500
NOT TO MENTION, USEFUL
FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WALK.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.800
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS SO COOL.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.000
OOH, SORRY.

32:13.000 --> 32:13.800
SORRY.

32:15.000 --> 32:15.800
(laughs) THIS IS GREAT.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.100
HEY, DANIEL, THANKS
FOR HELPING JUSTIN OUT TODAY.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.600
OH, HE'S A GREAT KID, YOU KNOW?
YEAH! (laughs)

32:25.700 --> 32:27.700
OH, SORRY.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD PLAYING
BASKETBALL WITHOUT YOUR LEGS.

32:27.700 --> 32:28.700
WHOA. SORRY.
HOW'D YOU MANAGE?

32:28.700 --> 32:31.800
YEAH, NO,
UH, JUSTIN WAS REALLY GOOD.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.200
BETTY?

32:37.800 --> 32:40.300
BETTY,
HOW DO I STOP THIS THING?
I DON'T KNOW.

32:40.300 --> 32:41.000
WHOA!

32:46.800 --> 32:47.700
(man) OKAY, I GOT IT.

32:47.700 --> 32:48.500
UH...

32:50.000 --> 32:52.700
I FORGOT. THE DOCTOR CALLED.
I CAN WALK!

32:54.100 --> 32:55.100
HOW COULD YOU?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.700
BETTY, I'M SORRY.
COME ON.

32:57.700 --> 33:01.500
YOU KNOW, I WASTED MY ENTIRE DAY
TRYING TO GET THAT STUPID THING,

33:01.500 --> 33:03.600
ALL SO YOU COULD
PLAY GRAB ASS? THAT'S RIGHT.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.200
THAT JUST HAPPENED.
I SAID "ASS."

33:05.200 --> 33:06.100
I HEARD YOU.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.900
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I COULD'VE BEEN DOING
WITH THAT TIME?

33:08.900 --> 33:11.300
I COULD'VE WRITTEN A SHORT STORY
OR--OR A WHOLE BUNCH

33:11.300 --> 33:13.400
OF SHORT STORIES, DEPENDING ON
HOW SHORT THEY WERE.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.500
OR WRITTEN IN MY JOURNAL,
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE

33:15.500 --> 33:18.000
MY LAST ENTRY WENT SOMETHING
LIKE, "I LOVE LANCE BASS.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.100
I WANT TO MARRY HIM."

33:19.800 --> 33:20.800
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE HEARD--

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
YEAH, I KNOW!

33:24.200 --> 33:25.700
HECTOR, DON'T DO THIS.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.100
FOR 30 YEARS, I THOUGHT
I KILLED YOUR FATHER.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.400
IT--IT TORTURED ME.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.400
SHUT UP.

33:31.900 --> 33:33.500
DON'T BECOME HIM.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.000
YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.500
HE IS THE WAY HE IS
BECAUSE OF YOU.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.800
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.000
HECTOR, DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

33:41.500 --> 33:42.500
YOU WERE 5 YEARS OLD,

33:42.500 --> 33:44.800
AND ROSA WOULD--
WOULD HIDE YOU IN THE KITCHEN

33:44.800 --> 33:46.400
WHEN YOUR FATHER
WAS DRUNK.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.800
NO, I DON'T REMEMBER.

33:49.800 --> 33:53.600
<i>I'D MAKE YOU ARROZ CON LECHE
TO KEEP YOU FROM CRYING,</i>

33:53.600 --> 33:56.300
SO HE WOULDN'T HEAR YOU
AND COME IN AND HIT YOU AGAIN.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.000
STOP IT!

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
HECTOR...

34:00.000 --> 34:02.700
ROSA CARED FOR YOU
AS IF YOU WERE HER OWN,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.200
BUT WE THOUGHT YOU'D BE SAFE
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.100
STOP IT!

34:06.100 --> 34:08.199
YOU WEREN'T, WERE YOU?

34:08.800 --> 34:11.199
HECTOR, WERE YOU?

34:17.600 --> 34:19.800
AND SPEAKING OF HONORING GENIUS,

34:19.800 --> 34:21.199
I'D ALSO LIKE
TO TAKE THIS MOMENT

34:21.199 --> 34:24.100
TO THANK ONE OF THE BIGGEST
PHILANTHROPISTS

34:24.100 --> 34:25.300
IN ALL OF FASHION--

34:26.100 --> 34:27.199
KENNETH COLE.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.900
(Kenneth) THANK YOU, DANIEL.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.699
I AM SO HONORED TO BE HERE,

34:36.699 --> 34:41.199
ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH A WORTHY
AND IMPORTANT CAUSE.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.400
(lowered voice)
WHAT'S THIS FOR AGAIN?

34:45.400 --> 34:47.199
(whispers) UH,
NEW YORK CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

34:47.699 --> 34:48.300
(normal voice) RIGHT.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.600
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.500
ARE YOU REMEMBERING
TO TAKE YOUR HEART MEDICINE?
CLAIRE?

34:55.199 --> 34:57.000
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

34:57.000 --> 35:00.300
SHE BEEN WITH ME, THAT'S WHERE
SHE BEEN, AND SHE IS FINE.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.700
WE GOT A LIFE NOW.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.600
YOGA, REALLY,
I'D LIKE SOMETHING CHOCOLATE.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.800
IT--IT--
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.100
WELL, ALMOST ONCE.
CLAIRE, THIS IS DANGEROUS.

35:14.100 --> 35:16.500
SOMEONE MIGHT SEE YOU.
I DON'T CARE.

35:19.700 --> 35:23.700
BRADFORD, COME WITH ME.
WALK OUT THAT DOOR RIGHT NOW.
DON'T DO THIS.

35:23.700 --> 35:25.100
PLEASE, JUST HEAR ME OUT.

35:25.100 --> 35:28.300
WE CAN DO THIS.
WE CAN DISAPPEAR.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.800
WE STILL HAVE
THOSE OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.600
THERE'S MONEY TO LIVE ON.
A FRESH START--

35:31.600 --> 35:34.800
NEW NAMES, NEW LIVES.
FOR GOD SAKE, CLAIRE,
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.800
I KNOW. I SOUND CRAZY.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.000
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED, HOW COULD I NOT BE?

35:42.800 --> 35:43.900
BUT, PLEASE.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.300
GOD, I LOVE YOU,

35:46.700 --> 35:49.400
AND I KNOW YOU LOVE ME.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.500
(Marc) MY GOD, WHAT THAT WOMAN
WILL DO FOR AN OPEN BAR.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.300
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL THE POLICE

35:57.800 --> 36:00.000
THE POLICE WILL
JUST PUT HER BACK IN JAIL.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.500
I KNOW
HOW TO REALLY HURT HER.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
I SUFFERED

36:04.300 --> 36:06.800
THROUGH YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH FEY FOR 20 YEARS.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.700
DON'T YOU OWE THIS TO ME?

36:11.600 --> 36:15.400
AND NOW ACCEPTING OUR DONATION
TO NEW YORK CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,

36:15.500 --> 36:17.900
OUR VERY OWN SHELDON.

36:20.300 --> 36:21.200
THANK YOU.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.300
THE LAST YEAR
HAS BEEN REALLY HARD FOR--

36:25.300 --> 36:27.200
ISN'T THAT INSPIRATIONAL?

36:27.200 --> 36:28.400
FRIENDS,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.800
I CANNOT WAIT ANOTHER MOMENT
TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.900
DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD,

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
THE BRADFORD MEADE-
WILHELMINA SLATER WEDDING

36:37.000 --> 36:38.400
IS BACK ON.

36:44.100 --> 36:45.800
BRADFORD, DARLING,
WHERE ARE YOU?

36:46.300 --> 36:47.700
CLAIRE, YOUR LIFE IS OVER.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.800
IT ENDED
THE DAY THAT YOU MURDERED FEY.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.300
I'M SORRY.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.100
WHY ISN'T HE DEAD?

37:12.100 --> 37:14.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T
DONE THIS YET. KILL HIM.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.200
HECTOR.
KILL HIM.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.100
YOU'RE SUCH
A DISAPPOINTMENT AS A SON.
HECTOR.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.000
KILL HIM!

37:29.600 --> 37:30.200
HEY.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.400
I BROUGHYOU THIS.

37:33.300 --> 37:34.600
THERE'S A BITE OUT OF IT.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.500
OKAY, I DIDN'T BRING IT FOR YOU,
I JUST THOUGHT OF IT.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.400
THE POINT IS,
I'M VERY SORRY, BETTY.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.700
DON'T BE.
I'M YOUR ASSISTANT,

37:44.700 --> 37:46.800
AND IT'S MY JOB TO DO
WHATEVER YOU ASK ME TO,

37:46.800 --> 37:49.800
EVEN IF IT IS SLIGHTLY OFFENSIVE
TO THE HANDI-CAPABLE.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.200
I THINK THAT MY MELTDOWN

37:52.200 --> 37:55.700
HAD A LOT MORE
TO DO WITH ME THAN YOU.

37:56.900 --> 37:57.900
I'M SORRY.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.500
SO WE'RE GOOD.
THAT'S GREAT.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.000
DANIEL, THERE'S MORE.

38:03.100 --> 38:06.800
LOOK,
I APPRECIATE THIS JOB,

38:07.700 --> 38:10.800
BUT I CAN'T LOSE TRACK
OF WHAT I WANT.

38:11.100 --> 38:14.000
ARE YOU QUITTING?
NO, NO, NO.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.800
I WAS JUST WONDERING, IF YOU
DON'T NEED ME DURING LUNCH,

38:19.100 --> 38:21.000
I'M GONNA ENROLL
IN A WRITING CLASS.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.100
OH, I THINK THAT'S GREAT,
BETTY.

38:23.100 --> 38:23.900
REALLY?

38:23.900 --> 38:24.600
YEAH.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.500
GREAT.
I'M GONNA BE A WRITER.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.400
GOOD.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.100
(woman) SHE'S SUCH A SLUT.
I LOVE HER.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.800
I KNOW. GOD.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.600
THE WHOLE OFFICE
IS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.500
I KNOW THEY ALWAYS DO,

38:44.500 --> 38:47.800
BUT NOW IT'S WITH ENVY
INSTEAD OF PITY AND DISGUST.

38:47.800 --> 38:51.800
AND LOOK! THAT'S MY FOOT
BEHIND THAT GUY. AAH!

38:52.900 --> 38:55.100
COME ON.
YOU WERE A HIT LAST NIGHT.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.500
OH, I KNOW.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.900
THE SWAG, MELISSA ETHERIDGE
BUYING ME A DOMESTIC BEER,

38:59.900 --> 39:01.300
APPEARING NUDE
IN THE TABLOIDS--

39:01.300 --> 39:04.100
I DIDN'T THINK I'D HAVE IT
THIS TOGETHER UNTIL I WAS 40.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.800
BUT LAST NIGHT
WHEN I WAS STANDING NAKED ON THE RED CARPET,

39:06.800 --> 39:09.100
DOING ALL THOSE POSES
THOSE GUYS WERE SHOUTING OUT,

39:09.100 --> 39:11.900
I REALLY HAD TIME TO THINK,
AND IT HIT ME--

39:11.900 --> 39:14.100
I'M NEVER GONNA GET
TO TALK TO MY MOTHER.

39:14.100 --> 39:18.300
AW.
SHE'S GONE, AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO MY FATHER IS.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.100
IT'S LIKE I'M AN ORPHAN.

39:20.100 --> 39:23.800
HEY,
YOU ARE NOT AN ORPHAN.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.700
YOU'VE GOT ME...

39:26.000 --> 39:27.500
AND YOU'VE GOT HALSTON,

39:28.000 --> 39:29.800
AND YOU'VE GOT THAT CREEPY GUY
THAT SAW YOUR PICTURE

39:29.800 --> 39:33.000
AND CALLED AND ASKED YOU TO STEP
ON HIS JUNK IN YOUR HEELS.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.200
AND THAT MEANS A LOT,
BUT I NEED SOMETHING MORE.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.000
WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FAME?

39:40.800 --> 39:41.600
MARC,

39:42.300 --> 39:44.700
I NEED TO FIND MY FATHER.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.600
IF I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I'VE COME FROM,

39:46.600 --> 39:48.700
HOW AM I EVER GONNA KNOW
WHO I AM?

39:50.000 --> 39:50.600
(clicks tongue) OH.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.400
"TRIED IT YOUR WAY--
NOT TERRIBLE. GIO."

40:04.000 --> 40:05.200
BETTY, HI.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.400
OH, HEY.
HEY.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.600
HOW ARE YOU? I HEARD YOU HAD
SOME OF HILDA'S HANGOVER PUNCH.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.400
YEAH, I DID.
KIND OF WORKED.
HM.

40:12.700 --> 40:15.300
UM, ANYWAY, LISTEN,
I-I-I REALLY NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

40:15.300 --> 40:17.500
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
BUT--

40:17.500 --> 40:20.200
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT OKAY. IT'S SHABBY
AND DISRESPECTFUL,

40:20.200 --> 40:21.900
AND I CAN ONLY SAY
THAT I WILL NEVER MIX

40:21.900 --> 40:23.900
WINE COOLERS
AND MY ANTIHISTAMINE AGAIN.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.900
THAT'S PROBABLY
A GOOD IDEA.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.700
AND I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I TALKED TO CHARLIE,

40:29.200 --> 40:30.300
AND SHE ADMITTED EVERYTHING.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.900
OH, UM...

40:32.800 --> 40:34.000
WHO'S THE FATHER?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.800
UM, WE'RE GONNA DO
A PATERNITY TEST.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.700
UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T DO IT
UNTIL HER 14th WEEK, SO...

40:40.300 --> 40:42.000
I GUESS
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU AND I

40:42.000 --> 40:44.100
WILL JUST HAVE TO SIT TIGHT
AND WAIT.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.500
YEAH, OKAY.

40:46.500 --> 40:50.200
UH, THEN THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL DO. WE WAIT.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.100
BYE.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.900
HEY, UH,
DO YOU WANT TO GET LUNCH?

40:57.900 --> 40:59.800
UH, OH, I CAN'T.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.900
I, UM, I HAVE
SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO,

41:01.900 --> 41:04.400
AND IT CAN'T WAIT. NOT THAT I
DON'T WANT TO, I DO.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.000
UM, UM, BUT I'LL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT IT LATER.

41:06.000 --> 41:06.900
OKAY.
OKAY.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.700
LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT YOUR LUNCH ANYWAY.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.700
SOMEONE GET YOU A PRESENT?

41:10.100 --> 41:14.700
UM, N-NO. UH,
THAT'S JUST HOW THEY WRAP IT.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.000
IT'S A FANCY PLACE.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.300
(Hilda) CREATIVE WRITING?

41:23.300 --> 41:25.800
UH-HUH. I WAS REALLY NERVOUS
ABOUT SIGNING UP,

41:25.800 --> 41:27.800
BUT THEN I FOUND MY LUCKY
TROLL PEN, AND I THOUGHT,

41:27.800 --> 41:29.300
HEY, THIS IS A GOOD SIGN.

41:29.300 --> 41:32.600
OH, BETTY,
YOU'RE GONNA NAIL THIS.

41:32.600 --> 41:33.700
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE NOTES
YOU WRITE ME.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.100
<i>THEY'RE ALWAYS SO FUN.
MIRA.</i>

41:35.700 --> 41:38.700
"HILDA,
HAVE A SPLENDIFEROUS DAY."

41:40.100 --> 41:41.200
(laughs) THAT'S IMAGINATION,
YOU KNOW,

41:41.200 --> 41:43.700
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT'S EVEN A WORD.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.300
ANYBODY HERE?

41:49.900 --> 41:51.400
<i>DAD?
PAPI?</i>

41:51.400 --> 41:53.900
(gasps)
AAH! OH, MY GOD!

41:54.200 --> 41:57.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
OH, MY G.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HOME.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.500
GRANDPA!
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
COMING BACK TOMORROW.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.900
OH, ARE YOU STARVING?
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?
NO, NO, NO.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.400
??????

42:05.900 --> 42:07.700
WE MISSED YOU.
YEAH.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.800
