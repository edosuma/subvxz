Oh, daddy dear, you know
you're still number one

40:59.460 --> 41:01.109
But girls, they...

41:01.120 --> 41:02.610
Grey: You want to talk
about the face?

41:02.620 --> 41:04.030
No.
No, I do not.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.200
I would like a beer,
though.

41:05.210 --> 41:07.326
You got it.
Mm.

41:07.330 --> 41:10.822
Hey, I, uh --
I signed this.

41:10.830 --> 41:11.785
You were right.

41:13.290 --> 41:15.326
I was thinking maybe
I take road,

41:15.330 --> 41:17.070
you take
parallel parking.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.160
...walk in the sun

41:18.170 --> 41:19.285
But girls...

41:19.290 --> 41:21.167
I'm proud of you.
Hmm.

41:22.420 --> 41:24.456
Hmm.

41:24.460 --> 41:25.825
You know, I was thinking
I would show up

41:25.830 --> 41:27.536
and just find
a note or something.

41:27.540 --> 41:29.371
You and her, Bonnie
and Clyde-ing up to Canada.

41:29.380 --> 41:31.325
Thought about it, but,
uh, can't do it.

41:31.330 --> 41:33.457
Can't run,
not from yourself.

41:33.460 --> 41:34.700
Yeah.

41:34.710 --> 41:36.917
Yeah, bummer,
isn't it?

41:36.920 --> 41:39.115
Yeah, kinda is.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.667
Plus, this place would
fall apart without me.

41:40.670 --> 41:42.114
[ Billiard balls clack]

41:42.120 --> 41:43.917
Wow.
I don't know about that.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.285
Positive. Yeah.
It would fall apart?

41:45.290 --> 41:46.609
I think it would --
You've been gone for like --

41:46.620 --> 41:48.451
Grey...
Don't.

41:48.460 --> 41:50.280
[ Both chuckle ]

41:53.000 --> 41:56.163
Just want to, just want to

41:56.170 --> 41:57.535
There you go.

41:57.540 --> 41:59.246
Where's that from?

41:59.250 --> 42:01.241
Some, uh, woman
ordered it for you.

42:01.250 --> 42:03.320
She was...

42:03.330 --> 42:04.991
uh, just here
a second ago.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.536
Just want to

42:06.540 --> 42:09.031
They just want to

42:09.040 --> 42:12.328
When the working day
is done

42:12.330 --> 42:16.118
Oh, girls,
they want to have fun

42:16.120 --> 42:21.114
Oh, girls
just want to have fun
