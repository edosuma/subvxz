WEBVTT

01:45.523 --> 01:47.354
Spartacus!

01:49.318 --> 01:51.809
You charge without thought--

01:51.988 --> 01:54.695
a weakness an opponent could turn
to advantage.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.572
A difficult feat from his backside.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.120
You speak without thought as well--

02:02.790 --> 02:04.951
another weakness.

02:08.170 --> 02:12.413
Thracians-- always on their back
with their legs spread.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.331
Where they belong.

02:15.511 --> 02:19.174
Forget everything you learned
outside these walls,

02:19.348 --> 02:21.589
for that is the world of men.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.598
We are more.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.556
We are gladiators!

02:26.731 --> 02:28.722
( men cheer)

02:29.900 --> 02:32.642
Study, train,

02:32.820 --> 02:34.811
bleed,

02:34.989 --> 02:37.776
and one day your name
will be legend,

02:37.950 --> 02:40.783
spoken in hushed whispers
of fear and awe,

02:40.953 --> 02:45.492
as the city speaks of Crixus,
champion of Capua.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.167
( men cheer)

02:47.335 --> 02:49.417
But his legend

02:49.587 --> 02:52.374
was not birthed in the arena.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.085
It was given life here

02:55.259 --> 02:57.671
in this ludus,

02:57.845 --> 02:59.881
under the sting of my whip!

03:02.266 --> 03:03.255
Attack!

04:10.251 --> 04:12.162
Attend.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.918
The vulcanalia is announced.

04:17.299 --> 04:19.210
Vulcanalia?

04:19.385 --> 04:22.092
A festival to ward off wildfires.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.756
Dominus Batiatus has seen fit
to fight 20

04:26.934 --> 04:28.674
at this year's vulcanalia--

04:28.853 --> 04:32.095
his gift to the people of Capua.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.764
Our lowest shall fight at dawn,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.978
eight pairs to follow,

04:37.153 --> 04:41.988
after which your master
will present his primus--

04:42.158 --> 04:44.399
two of our finest

04:44.577 --> 04:46.568
to meet in the arena.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.405
Crixus then?

04:50.583 --> 04:52.073
Crixus certainly.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.991
And his opponent?

04:54.170 --> 04:57.708
Against the champion of Capua--

04:57.882 --> 05:00.589
what would it matter?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.926
( insects chirping, dogs barking )

05:12.104 --> 05:16.643
20 men-- | pledged 20 men
to fill the ranks of the vulcanalia,

05:16.817 --> 05:19.900
my own coin
to see each victor paid.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.447
What thanks do | get
from the magistrate?

05:22.615 --> 05:26.233
He fears he will be unable to attend
our reception on the eve of the games

05:26.410 --> 05:29.117
- due to pressing concerns.
- Of what sort?

05:29.288 --> 05:32.075
I hear a rumor
he dines with Solonius instead.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.912
Solonius? But he offers
not one man for the vulcanalia.

05:36.086 --> 05:40.705
Yet his tongue still manages to find
its way to the magistrate's asshole.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.590
Is that new?

05:43.761 --> 05:46.127
For the reception, yes.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.422
The rising cost of this thing
raises concern.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.137
It raises opportunity.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.927
I question not its import.
I question its scale.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.642
This drought has stretched
our resources thin,

05:57.816 --> 05:59.898
and now without the attendance
of the magistrate--

06:00.069 --> 06:04.028
Darling, you must spend coins
to receive coins.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.813
My husband taught me that.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.856
A wise man.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.448
He has his moments.
And this will be one of them.

06:11.622 --> 06:15.456
You'll delight and astound,
securing business for the year to come,

06:15.626 --> 06:19.619
and perhaps even tempt Glaber's wife
to take up the cause of patronage.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.253
||ithyia?

06:21.423 --> 06:24.039
I thought she was still in Rome
with that ungrateful husband of hers.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.129
She returns absent him for the games.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.045
She's acquiring quite a taste for them,

06:29.223 --> 06:31.635
one which I shall nourish to advantage.

06:31.809 --> 06:35.142
This new color suits you.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.689
Shall I dye the rest to match?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.646
( bird screeches )

06:42.820 --> 06:45.186
( cock crows )

06:53.414 --> 06:55.826
( pigeon cooing )

06:56.000 --> 06:58.241
The bird would be better
served in my bowl.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.915
Odds the meal would be your last.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.716
He stands but tall.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.467
He stands a legend.

07:11.015 --> 07:14.849
After Carthage suffered defeat
by the Romans,

07:15.019 --> 07:16.930
they forced hundreds of his people

07:17.104 --> 07:19.846
to fight against each other
in the arena.

07:20.024 --> 07:22.185
Half a day passed,

07:22.359 --> 07:25.442
and only two remained--

07:29.325 --> 07:33.819
Barca and the chief of his people,

07:35.539 --> 07:37.575
the noble Mago.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.961
Skill and the testament of years
were his allies...

07:49.053 --> 07:51.385
strength and youth-- Barca's.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.718
Mago fell to his knees.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.856
And Barca became the Beast of Carthage.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.940
He sent an old man on his way.

08:09.114 --> 08:12.106
Mago was a warrior of fierce renown,

08:12.284 --> 08:14.445
a chief upon a throne of blood.

08:18.248 --> 08:21.832
He was also Barca's father,
as the story tells.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.872
Is it true?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.961
In the world of the gladiator,

08:30.135 --> 08:33.127
a man's fame and glory
constructs its own truth.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.630
Fame and glory.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.930
I seek neither.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.604
Coin then, like me.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.983
Batiatus: Open the gates.
And have the guard ready.

08:51.407 --> 08:53.989
A moment, Dominus.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.195
10 paces.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.654
Is there any news of my wife?

08:59.832 --> 09:01.823
She was indeed sold
to a Syrian merchant.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.160
You found her?

09:03.335 --> 09:05.792
l have cause to believe
she sails upon the Orontes.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.579
To Damascus then,
or perhaps Antioch?

09:08.757 --> 09:10.964
Do I appear a fucking arrow,

09:11.135 --> 09:13.296
my nose pointing towards your wife's
dripping thighs?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.051
You press beyond position.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.008
Dominus.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.047
The search continues.
That's all you need to know.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.093
Until then, fight, win.
The price of her freedom requires

09:22.271 --> 09:24.853
substantial sums on your part.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.862
Too common.
Show me something of note.

09:41.039 --> 09:45.032
A moment. I have just the thing.
My finest piece-- a flawless gem

09:45.210 --> 09:47.997
imported at great cost
from the mines of Scythia.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.387
- Price?
- 30 dinarii.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.552
30?

10:04.730 --> 10:08.348
This piece-- is it something
that llithyia would favor?

10:08.525 --> 10:12.484
It's the only piece l'd show her.
She has very refined tastes.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.690
25.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.823
g .__ :

10:17.993 --> 10:20.700
and I'll resist
pitching you off the balcony.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.782
28then.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.742
Hmm.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.124
Come along then.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.882
Doctore: Form two. Ready?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.839
One.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.004
(men grunting)

10:40.182 --> 10:42.844
Form one. Ready?

10:43.852 --> 10:45.388
One.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.897
Two.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.109
Form two. Ready?

10:55.489 --> 10:57.025
One.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.158
Two.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.539
Form three.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.083
Stand.

11:17.469 --> 11:21.257
Spartacus, do you dream
of the mines?

11:21.431 --> 11:24.764
My focus is on blood and battle,
Doctore.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.142
Yet your training proves you
worthy of neither.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.101
I'm a Thracian.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.640
It is in my blood.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.809
Thrace?

11:34.987 --> 11:37.524
Hmm.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.691
A swamp of piss.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.499
( chuckles )

12:07.769 --> 12:09.350
Kneel.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.198
The land from which you hail

12:31.376 --> 12:33.367
matters no longer.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.036
The only thing that does

12:36.214 --> 12:38.626
is the sound of my voice

12:38.800 --> 12:40.961
and the sand beneath your feet.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.721
( men laugh )

12:45.891 --> 12:47.381
(spits)

12:47.559 --> 12:50.972
You will learn to worship it.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.353
Back to training.

12:53.523 --> 12:58.438
The sand smells like Thrace.

12:58.612 --> 13:02.400
Perhaps I should shit
to complete the aroma.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.860
( men laugh )

13:05.035 --> 13:07.777
You-- you're summoned.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.254
This drought seems never to end.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.759
How do you fare?

13:31.937 --> 13:33.768
Domina provides for me.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.935
That's good. Good.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.101
How long have you served Domina?

13:41.905 --> 13:44.271
All my life.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.826
l was born in this ludus.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.952
You've recently come to blossom.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.204
I barely noticed until I saw you

13:52.374 --> 13:54.786
at the games with Domina
three moons past.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.953
I fought Arnoch of Tarquinii.
Did you enjoy my victory?

13:59.131 --> 14:01.497
l was pleased

14:01.675 --> 14:03.211
when it ended.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.798
It's no easy task
to sever a man's head.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.927
You must find the right angle.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.677
I do not favor the games.

14:14.855 --> 14:18.018
( laughs)

14:18.191 --> 14:21.183
Well, that is an odd bent

14:21.361 --> 14:25.445
for a slave at a gladiator school.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.650
One not to be straightened.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.199
I do not mean to insult.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.364
Domina awaits.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.727
You walk too slowly to my chambers.

15:05.906 --> 15:10.275
I do not want to arouse the suspicions
of my men as to my purpose.

15:11.411 --> 15:15.154
What might that be,
0 Champion of Capua?

15:15.332 --> 15:18.074
Whatever Domina desires.

15:30.180 --> 15:33.388
I bought this necklace
for the reception.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.389
Do you think it's too much?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.937
My blood rises,

15:38.105 --> 15:41.097
though to give the necklace credit
would be false.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.311
And what quickens your pulse?

15:46.238 --> 15:49.105
A touch of your lips,

15:49.282 --> 15:51.694
your breasts,

15:51.868 --> 15:54.245
and all of the pleasures below.

15:59.459 --> 16:03.168
I need your cock inside me,

16:03.338 --> 16:06.125
and I need it in me now.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.175
Never lose focus,

16:15.350 --> 16:19.218
not if Jupiter himself
were to rip open the heavens

16:19.396 --> 16:21.603
and dangle his cock
from the skies.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.059
A gladiator's first distraction

16:24.234 --> 16:26.065
is his last.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.898
Not all contests end in death.

16:29.072 --> 16:33.486
Two fingers-- a sign of surrender

16:33.660 --> 16:35.821
and shame.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.699
The oath I swore to this place
did not include begging.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.670
He inquires as to the nuances--

16:47.841 --> 16:50.207
I need no lesson in submission.

16:52.137 --> 16:55.095
You prefer a different lesson--

16:55.265 --> 16:57.506
in obedience perhaps?

16:59.477 --> 17:01.684
To the hole,

17:01.855 --> 17:03.811
both of you!

17:17.871 --> 17:19.953
Perhaps I spoke out of turn.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.863
Perhaps.

17:22.042 --> 17:25.330
What I perceived as courage in you
reveals itself foolishness.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.994
To surrender in the arena--
I cannot do it.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.834
I must have victory.

17:30.008 --> 17:33.125
What happens if that is
something you cannot provide?

17:34.679 --> 17:36.715
Oh, silence then?

17:36.890 --> 17:40.633
Next time you vex Doctore, you'll find
my tongue of a similar fashion.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.471
Your company here
was not my intent.

17:42.646 --> 17:46.184
Yet here I stand beside you,
my cock soaking in the same shit.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.144
Apologies.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.024
That's all?

17:50.195 --> 17:52.902
No reason behind it?

17:53.073 --> 17:56.611
No glimpse into the fevered brain of
what the fuck are you doing?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.901
I seek only to please Batiatus.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.070
Pluto's asshole.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.830
The answer has no balance
with your actions.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.534
He made me a promise.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.749
What could he offer a man
who seeks neither fame nor glory?

18:11.841 --> 18:14.002
My wife...

18:16.012 --> 18:18.719
taken from me when l was
captured by the Romans.

18:18.890 --> 18:22.257
l prevail in the arena,
and he will find her.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.011
Is she worth it?

18:28.191 --> 18:30.182
She's worth everything.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.611
As is mine.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.119
Two years here,

18:40.287 --> 18:43.404
pay my debt with the winnings--
hold her in my arms again.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.203
Perhaps this smell
will have washed off by then.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.709
( laughs)

18:54.926 --> 18:56.757
What name do you call her?

18:56.928 --> 18:58.919
Aurelia.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.462
Yours?

19:01.474 --> 19:04.261
Sura.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.427
So...

19:06.604 --> 19:09.220
buried up to our balls in garbage--

19:09.399 --> 19:11.560
is this part of your plan
to get Sura back?

19:19.075 --> 19:22.567
You would waste your ration
cleaning a bit of cloth?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.162
It bears meaning to me.

19:31.379 --> 19:32.994
Gather.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.836
Your master's hand has been at work.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.879
The pairings of the vulcanalia
have been decided.

19:43.933 --> 19:48.142
Crixus, unbeaten champion of Capua,

19:48.313 --> 19:51.271
you will honor the house of Batiatus

19:51.441 --> 19:53.432
by fighting in his primus.

19:53.610 --> 19:56.647
And who will challenge me, Doctore?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.904
A man of skill and dedication.

20:03.078 --> 20:06.570
His ability, his hard work
and his hunger

20:06.748 --> 20:09.205
shall be rewarded--

20:09.376 --> 20:12.038
Gnaeus.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.751
At last we meet, brother.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.257
Don't die too quickly.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.260
Me?

20:22.430 --> 20:24.716
I will fuck your corpse.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.882
(men laughing)

20:27.060 --> 20:29.517
With what cock?

20:30.647 --> 20:32.888
Ashur has the remainder.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.274
May the gods be with you.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.027
One by one.
One by one, you fucking cunts.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.904
Batiatus himself handed me this list.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.441
Give it here, shitfuck.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.696
Ashur: Savages.

20:51.543 --> 20:54.000
Fucking cock.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.206
Let me see.

20:59.384 --> 21:01.966
Shit, give it here.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.128
Did you gain position?

21:04.305 --> 21:06.011
As did you.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.173
We are set to fight each other

21:08.351 --> 21:10.717
at the beginning of the games.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.272
The first match--

21:13.440 --> 21:15.772
the slot of the meek and insubstantial.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.933
We shall prove otherwise.

21:18.111 --> 21:21.274
And to what aim? The victor's purse
won't be more than half a coin.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.858
So little?

21:23.032 --> 21:24.738
Not enough for either
of our causes.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.115
And the primus?

21:26.286 --> 21:27.867
Considerably more.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.449
I've already bested Crixus once
in the final test.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.990
Now I must fight my way up
through the dregs to face him again?

21:34.169 --> 21:35.375
Dregs, am |?

21:35.545 --> 21:37.536
You know my meaning.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.500
lf Batiatus hadn't stayed my hand,

21:39.674 --> 21:41.710
lwould have parted his brains
from his skull.

21:41.885 --> 21:44.592
There's no love lost
between myself and Crixus.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.468
( exhales )

21:46.639 --> 21:49.301
But I caution-- he's dangerous.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.020
A reputation built on what,

21:53.188 --> 21:55.975
facing men such as Gnaeus
and his little net?

21:56.149 --> 21:59.391
Crixus forged his reputation
against far worse--

21:59.569 --> 22:02.402
demons belched from
the underworld.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.437
The Gargan twins.

22:04.616 --> 22:05.822
Uh-huh.

22:07.535 --> 22:11.494
Decimus and Tiberius,
sons of a whore raped by a jackal,

22:11.664 --> 22:13.655
more beasts than men.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.792
They terrorized the eastern seaboard
for many years until their capture.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.953
They were cast in the arena to die

22:20.131 --> 22:23.339
and instead flourished on meals
of bone and blood--

22:30.099 --> 22:33.933
the bodies of stout men
left in their wake, half devoured.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.470
No one dared face them willingly
except for one--

22:37.649 --> 22:40.482
Crixus, the champion of Capua.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.649
The blood flowed.
The crowd roared.

22:44.822 --> 22:47.279
And the demons fell
beneath his sword.

23:11.641 --> 23:14.132
Spartacus: The sons of a jackal?

23:14.310 --> 23:16.392
So they say.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.271
This story is a jest

23:20.441 --> 23:22.568
like Crixus himself.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.442
Did you hear this one?

23:27.865 --> 23:30.402
One day maybe you'll prove yourself.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.944
Till then you'll fight at dawn
with the rest of the shitwhores.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.059
I keep pace with the mighty Spartacus.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.224
Does that place my worth
among the dregs?

24:04.402 --> 24:07.519
-( laughs) I misspoke.
- A thing with you, is it not?

24:07.697 --> 24:12.031
I shall call you equal.
More will need to be earned.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.192
It will be a good fight.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.235
May the gods see us both survive.

24:16.414 --> 24:19.326
There are many I would see dead
in this place.

24:22.045 --> 24:24.582
You may not have a choice.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.088
There's always a choice.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.598
That look gives me worry.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.183
Words I've often heard from my wife.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.603
Your net's aim
is remarkably true, Gnaeus.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.907
You strike an impressive figure

24:55.078 --> 24:58.445
battling that little wooden man.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.501
I long to see you in the arena,

25:02.669 --> 25:04.330
among the men.

25:04.504 --> 25:08.167
There you are
with your fierce net,

25:08.341 --> 25:12.505
like a young, wet girl.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.965
Fucking cunt.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.973
The sun has made Gnaeus mad.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.437
He charged like a crazed goat.

25:29.612 --> 25:33.525
I saw his eyes.
They were wild with thirst.

25:35.410 --> 25:38.994
Barca, Kerza, tend to Gnaeus.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.534
Back to work!

26:03.646 --> 26:06.558
Ashur,

26:06.733 --> 26:10.191
there's something I need you
to get for me.

26:10.361 --> 26:14.070
Whatever your needs,
Ashur provides.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.905
Follow me

26:17.076 --> 26:19.567
away from prying ears.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.557
I must make a point
to stop standing beside you.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.933
Gnaeus is of an unsteady nature.

26:48.107 --> 26:51.941
If your intent was to claim Gnaeus's
berth in the primus, you're a fool.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.399
He served five years
before being afforded the privilege.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.407
Sura cannot afford years.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.284
Nor your death,

27:02.455 --> 27:05.788
which is surely your station
if you face Crixus in the arena.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.415
Gladiators,

27:08.586 --> 27:10.372
your public has arrived.

27:10.546 --> 27:13.879
Dress quickly.
The reception begins.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.048
(music playing )

27:25.436 --> 27:27.768
( laughs )
Crixus,

27:27.939 --> 27:30.396
let good Mercato have a closer look
at your sword.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.773
Dominus.

27:32.944 --> 27:35.560
( Batiatus guffaws )

27:35.738 --> 27:40.107
The very blade used to strike down
Tiberius and Decimus.

27:41.744 --> 27:44.486
If you were to bestow Capua
with a gift of a munus,

27:44.664 --> 27:47.201
what better means
than by securing Crixus

27:47.375 --> 27:51.334
along with a dozen or so of my other
offerings to round out proceedings?

27:51.504 --> 27:54.792
l have been contemplating the games
in honor of my good friend--

27:54.966 --> 27:58.458
Ashur, good Mercato has set his mind
to a day of games.

27:58.636 --> 28:01.218
Let's see his order well filled,
shall we?

28:01.389 --> 28:03.380
Go.

28:03.558 --> 28:06.675
- Oh, the dust and the heat.
- It worsens by the hour.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.844
l'd yet be in Rome
if it weren't for the games.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.977
You must promise to visit
while I'm here.

28:11.148 --> 28:13.139
My father's villa
is beyond depressing.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.603
It's unfortunate that your husband
couldn'tjoin you.

28:15.778 --> 28:17.018
How fares the legatus?

28:17.196 --> 28:20.233
In a mood.
Since his return from Thrace,

28:20.408 --> 28:22.694
the senate has become
his mistress.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.609
Her demands on him
are boundless.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.698
Men and their ambitions.

28:26.873 --> 28:30.616
You know, they should learn
to appreciate the finer things in life.

28:31.961 --> 28:35.328
That necklace-- I adore it.

28:35.506 --> 28:37.713
Oh, this? It's a trinket.

28:37.884 --> 28:41.001
Calls to mind a piece I had
from Ramel one season,

28:41.178 --> 28:44.545
when emerald was still
the fashion.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.181
I hear it's coming back around.

28:47.351 --> 28:50.514
Oh, perhaps l'll root mine out then.

28:52.148 --> 28:55.481
Friends old and new,
gratitude for honoring

28:55.651 --> 28:58.688
the storied ludus of Batiatus
with your presence this eve.

28:58.863 --> 29:03.197
Tomorrow's vulcanalia promises
many glories in the arena.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.359
But tonight
may I present you

29:06.537 --> 29:09.620
with the finest gladiators
in all of the republic?

29:13.711 --> 29:15.997
( crowd exclaiming )

29:16.172 --> 29:18.959
Look, touch,

29:19.133 --> 29:21.499
feel the quality of the stock.

29:21.677 --> 29:24.794
Place orders for any of the men
you covet.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.511
Come, don't be bashful.
They won't bite.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.552
And if they do, a 10% discount.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.272
The crowd fancies our Thracian,
don't they?

29:44.450 --> 29:48.284
A curiosity born of his fortune
against Solonius's men.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.820
Better curiosity than indifference.

29:50.998 --> 29:54.866
Perhaps we could fuel this interest
into a conflagration of coin.

29:55.044 --> 29:57.751
With Gnaeus of questionable skull,

29:57.922 --> 30:00.163
what make you of Spartacus
as replacement in the primus?

30:00.341 --> 30:02.423
With respect, Dominus,

30:02.593 --> 30:04.879
the public seeks an honorable fight.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.965
Spartacus is yet an animal.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.721
Well, I'll think on.

30:09.892 --> 30:13.430
One day, though,
a contest to be promoted.

30:19.235 --> 30:21.226
A moment alone--

30:21.404 --> 30:23.941
a rarity for a man
with such an adoring public, huh?

30:25.282 --> 30:28.069
( clears throat )
To business then.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.530
A difficult task
on a short notice, yet...

30:31.664 --> 30:34.622
carried to completion.

30:42.299 --> 30:43.755
Cockfucker.

30:43.926 --> 30:48.295
Your Gaul is of a fine cut,
is he not?

30:48.472 --> 30:50.679
None finer in all of the republic.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.091
Such a man.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.981
l tremble to see him again
at the arena.

31:01.152 --> 31:03.689
As do we all.

31:15.416 --> 31:18.123
The Thracian yet lives.

31:20.337 --> 31:22.373
For now.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.374
Is there nothing more
of interest to see?

31:26.552 --> 31:29.635
Well, my husband will shortly announce
his primus.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.136
And there's ample wine.

31:31.307 --> 31:34.390
I fear it already beckons
my sleep.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.808
Perhaps l'd best take leave.

31:39.982 --> 31:43.315
Of course.

31:43.486 --> 31:47.149
Of course, there is one thing
that I thought you might enjoy.

31:47.323 --> 31:50.736
It's something of a much more
physical nature.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.902
You,

31:54.080 --> 31:55.741
come with me.

32:22.858 --> 32:27.477
Five dinarii says he doesn't last
another 20 strokes.

32:34.036 --> 32:36.618
I've never seen a gladiator fuck before.

32:38.457 --> 32:42.325
Look at the way he rams her,

32:42.503 --> 32:45.290
like an enraged bull.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.455
A gladiator's virtues extend

32:47.633 --> 32:49.919
well beyond
the sands of the arena.

32:50.094 --> 32:54.007
As lovers they are said
to be ravenous beasts.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.921
You can touch.

32:59.854 --> 33:02.766
Forgive me, Aurelia.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.773
They provide unimaginable pleasures.

33:19.582 --> 33:21.994
Can he do it again?

33:22.168 --> 33:24.124
Make him do it again.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.790
Proceed.

33:33.637 --> 33:36.549
- So are we in agreement?
- Rabanus will meet Crixus.

33:36.724 --> 33:40.137
We'll move Hamilcar up
to fill the void.

33:46.609 --> 33:49.271
I overheard Batiatus and Doctore
in conference--

33:49.445 --> 33:52.357
the primus their intent.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.193
The Sardinian is to face Crixus.

33:56.869 --> 33:59.702
The news does not balance
my cause.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.874
Whatever your thoughts,
cast them out.

34:10.049 --> 34:14.713
Good citizens,
you have enjoyed my food, my wine,

34:14.887 --> 34:19.005
the aphrodisiac presence
of my beautiful wife.

34:19.183 --> 34:21.970
Now marvel at the announcing
for tomorrow's primus.

34:22.144 --> 34:25.511
Crixus, the champion of Capua,

34:25.689 --> 34:29.056
will stride across the sand and face--

34:30.527 --> 34:32.609
( crowd exclaiming )

34:34.240 --> 34:36.731
Spartacus!

34:36.909 --> 34:38.570
No, let them fight.

34:50.464 --> 34:51.829
Enough.

34:57.888 --> 35:00.049
I'll take your fucking heart.

35:00.224 --> 35:02.260
Come and take it, coward.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.854
Ha!

35:13.028 --> 35:15.861
See the hatred burning
beyond control.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.567
Eh?

35:17.741 --> 35:19.732
This was merely a taste.

35:19.910 --> 35:24.779
Tomorrow they will settle this grudge
in the arena.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.868
( crowd cheers )

35:29.753 --> 35:34.087
Crixus the undefeated,

35:34.258 --> 35:37.921
Spartacus-- the dog who defies death.

35:40.264 --> 35:42.630
A fight for the ages.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.764
Glory to Capua!

35:44.935 --> 35:47.051
Glory to Rome!

35:47.229 --> 35:48.435
To Rome!

36:03.579 --> 36:06.696
The reception nearly ruined,
and what is his punishment?

36:06.874 --> 36:08.865
The fucking primus.

36:09.043 --> 36:11.284
You heard the crowd.
I made the best of the situation.

36:11.462 --> 36:14.204
The Thracian is yet to stand
a single match as gladiator.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.997
Why leap him ahead of all the others
to face Crixus?

36:17.176 --> 36:20.885
Because of what he possesses--
the public's interest.

36:21.055 --> 36:23.046
They stroke a rabid dog.

36:23.223 --> 36:26.386
Spartacus has struck a chord.
I intend to maximize its profit.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.972
He's unpredictable.

36:29.146 --> 36:31.387
He has no regard for rules
or for honor.

36:31.565 --> 36:33.226
And if something
happens to Crixus--

36:33.400 --> 36:35.982
He poses no threat to Crixus.
He is but a novelty

36:36.153 --> 36:38.644
to be used and discarded
after a purpose.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.199
Fucking gods' cock,
is there no wine left?

36:41.367 --> 36:44.655
What are you standing there for?

36:44.828 --> 36:46.784
Go and get some fucking wine.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.006
(jug crashes)

37:00.177 --> 37:02.213
Apologies.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.424
I did not mean to startle.

37:08.852 --> 37:11.264
When we spoke last,

37:11.438 --> 37:13.144
I meant no offense.

37:13.315 --> 37:17.228
I am practiced with sword,
not words.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.644
lf Domina discovers
I dropped the lastjug--

37:19.822 --> 37:23.906
Hand me the pieces.
I'll see them over the cliff.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.667
Wait.

37:43.220 --> 37:48.260
Perhaps this gift will explain
where words fail.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.222
Please.

38:08.829 --> 38:10.239
( gasps )

38:23.594 --> 38:26.051
I'm trying to decide.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.257
Upon what?

38:28.432 --> 38:31.139
Congratulations or condolences.

38:31.310 --> 38:34.052
You may have bested Crixus once

38:34.229 --> 38:36.481
by tripping him with that bit of cloth,

38:36.648 --> 38:39.139
but to face him in the arena--

38:39.318 --> 38:41.934
I believe his reputation inflated.

38:42.112 --> 38:45.900
Tomorrow I shall prove it so.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.907
Next he'll boast he can defeat
Theokoles himself.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.490
Perhaps, if I knew the man.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.655
( laughter)

38:54.833 --> 38:57.996
Theokoles-- the shadow of death.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.502
He speaks so brazenly of the arena.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.334
He knows nothing of its history.

39:05.344 --> 39:08.632
Theokoles is no man, Thracian.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.760
He is something else entirely.

39:14.937 --> 39:17.724
They say he stands over 10' tall.

39:17.898 --> 39:21.811
The very ground trembles at his feet,

39:21.985 --> 39:24.977
his shadow eclipsing the sun.

39:25.155 --> 39:29.068
Most men fall dead
at the sight of the giant.

39:29.243 --> 39:31.985
They are the fortunate ones.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.703
My father tells of a munus

39:42.881 --> 39:45.463
where the shadow fought
over 100 men.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.760
But one survived.

39:51.974 --> 39:54.340
A tale

39:54.518 --> 39:56.554
to frighten children.

39:57.563 --> 40:00.100
Theokoles is no legend.

40:00.274 --> 40:02.560
Before he retired from the arena,

40:02.734 --> 40:05.646
only one man ever faced him
and lived.

40:05.821 --> 40:08.187
And he breathes among us,

40:08.365 --> 40:11.607
his whip ever at our backs.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.945
Now is not the hour
for idle talk.

40:16.123 --> 40:19.240
Tomorrow you step into the arena,

40:19.418 --> 40:23.002
many for the first time,

40:23.171 --> 40:25.708
for some perhaps the last.

40:34.224 --> 40:36.886
( gate opens, footsteps )

40:37.060 --> 40:40.598
( crowd roaring, metal clanging )

40:45.027 --> 40:47.234
They cheer for blood.

40:47.404 --> 40:50.237
And they shall have it.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.735
May the gods bring you fortune
as they did me this morning.

40:58.665 --> 41:02.624
Sura believed in the gods

41:02.794 --> 41:05.536
when the Romans took her.

41:05.714 --> 41:09.923
Not one descended from the heavens
to intervene.

41:12.054 --> 41:14.966
I shall correct their mistake
presently.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.431
I believe you will.

41:23.482 --> 41:26.474
( blood gushes, man screams )

41:26.652 --> 41:30.520
Capua!

41:30.697 --> 41:33.439
The crowd favor your offerings.

41:33.617 --> 41:37.280
Yes, a fine showing all around.
You honor our fair city, Batiatus.

41:37.454 --> 41:39.445
The honor is mine, Magistrate.

41:39.623 --> 41:43.332
Truth told, I feared the event would
pass without anything of note this year.

41:43.502 --> 41:47.586
It's very difficult to procure
men of worth for these minor games.

41:47.756 --> 41:51.294
Good Solonius was already taken
with loftier engagements.

41:51.468 --> 41:54.301
Perhaps Solonius will be available
next year.

41:54.471 --> 41:56.632
One can but pray.

41:59.643 --> 42:02.931
Perhaps I was wrong
to return absent the rain.

42:04.606 --> 42:07.188
Some water perhaps,

42:07.359 --> 42:09.350
or maybe some wine.

42:09.528 --> 42:13.020
Ugh, the thought churns the stomach.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.989
Your company last night

42:17.160 --> 42:19.537
yet astounds the senses.

42:19.705 --> 42:20.911
Too much?

42:21.081 --> 42:22.617
Of wine, definitely.

42:22.791 --> 42:25.999
Of other interests,

42:26.169 --> 42:29.332
I think the surface barely scratched.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.918
Some water then

42:32.092 --> 42:34.299
to slake your current thirst.

42:34.469 --> 42:35.800
( laughs)

42:42.269 --> 42:44.100
Here we go then.

42:45.522 --> 42:47.854
Good citizens of Capua,

42:48.024 --> 42:50.015
it is my great honor

42:50.193 --> 42:52.479
to introduce to you

42:52.654 --> 42:55.612
the primus
of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus.

42:55.782 --> 42:58.524
( crowd cheering )

43:08.044 --> 43:10.376
Enter Thraex!

43:16.887 --> 43:19.173
Behold Spartacus!

43:20.182 --> 43:25.051
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

43:25.228 --> 43:28.641
Renowned for his magnificent victory

43:28.815 --> 43:31.852
at the games of Senator Albinius,

43:32.027 --> 43:34.018
where he single-handedly
slaughtered

43:34.196 --> 43:37.438
four of Solonius's gladiators-- four!

43:42.746 --> 43:44.282
Enter murmillo!

43:57.719 --> 44:02.133
The marvel before you
needs no introduction.

44:02.307 --> 44:06.892
He's known by his sword,
by his shield, by his glory!

44:07.062 --> 44:08.802
( roars )

44:12.901 --> 44:17.270
Crixus, champion of Capua.

44:17.447 --> 44:20.029
Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!

44:24.162 --> 44:27.154
Finally, Crixus.

44:28.834 --> 44:31.951
Look how his form
catches the sun.

44:33.713 --> 44:36.500
Capua!

44:36.675 --> 44:38.916
Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!

44:47.060 --> 44:49.517
Capua!

44:52.524 --> 44:55.812
Batiatus:
In honor of the name of Batiatus

44:55.986 --> 44:58.272
and the sacred vulcanalia--

44:58.446 --> 45:00.858
( screams )

45:14.296 --> 45:18.585
You've not yet finished the oration,
and yet the Thracian attacks.

45:18.758 --> 45:22.091
- Was that not supposed to happen?
- No, it was not.

45:22.262 --> 45:24.628
How exciting.

45:53.543 --> 45:56.034
( screams )

46:24.824 --> 46:27.440
Is that all the Thracian is capable of?

46:27.619 --> 46:30.406
After what he did
against Solonius's men,

46:30.580 --> 46:32.081
I had hoped for more.

47:05.115 --> 47:07.731
( crowd chanting )
Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!

47:30.807 --> 47:33.890
Kill him!

47:34.060 --> 47:36.802
Crixus, I love you!

47:36.980 --> 47:39.016
(laughing)

47:39.190 --> 47:41.852
Capua!

47:42.027 --> 47:45.144
Shall I begin?

48:01.087 --> 48:03.169
(coughs)

48:05.091 --> 48:07.628
( screams )

49:24.504 --> 49:27.541
Now you die, Thracian.

49:29.092 --> 49:32.584
( crowd chanting )
Kill kill kill kill!

50:44.834 --> 50:47.917
Spartacus fought well.

50:53.593 --> 50:55.925
Let him live
to fight another day.

51:10.985 --> 51:13.647
A sour bite to end the meal.

51:13.821 --> 51:16.278
Apologies,

51:16.449 --> 51:18.815
yet Spartacus was
of some cost to me.

51:20.578 --> 51:23.365
You've already lost the crowd.

51:30.421 --> 51:32.457
He lives.

51:33.716 --> 51:35.752
How disappointing.

52:14.799 --> 52:17.006
His reputation is well-earned.

52:17.176 --> 52:19.758
My blade could find no weakness.

52:24.309 --> 52:28.678
And yet it was there--

52:29.731 --> 52:31.972
at least 10 points

52:32.150 --> 52:35.233
where you could have
seized advantage.

52:35.403 --> 52:37.564
You needed more training.

52:42.076 --> 52:44.453
I shall train harder then.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.654
No.

52:48.833 --> 52:51.666
It is too late for such things.

53:18.780 --> 53:19.018
(theme music playing )

53:19.030 --> 53:20.816
(theme music playing )
