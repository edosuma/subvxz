00:01.251 --> 00:04.584
(insects chirping)

00:19.394 --> 00:22.727
(vehicles approaching)

00:24.607 --> 00:27.690
(panting)

00:45.253 --> 00:48.586
(walkers growling in distance)

00:56.639 --> 00:58.254
Step.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.642
(panting)

01:38.807 --> 01:41.890
(crying)

01:43.603 --> 01:45.264
Please.
Please don't.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.349
Please, God, no.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.357
I hate this.
Please!

01:53.905 --> 01:56.112
(door opens, creaks)

02:11.256 --> 02:12.462
(door creaks)

02:36.906 --> 02:38.646
Welcome home,
haircut.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.755
There's more
at the library.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.590
A lot more.

03:01.764 --> 03:02.890
(sniffles)

03:03.057 --> 03:04.217
You, uh--

03:04.392 --> 03:06.303
you have a library?

03:06.477 --> 03:07.808
Your friend Daryl

03:07.979 --> 03:10.186
didn't get a chance to see it
before he bounced.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.060
He escaped?

03:13.234 --> 03:14.770
Yeah.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.559
You know
where he is?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.729
No.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.944
I'd tell you
ifl did.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.484
(Eugene sniffles)

03:24.662 --> 03:26.948
Vonda N. McIntyre.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.784
Th-this will be
satisfactory.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.368
(sniffles)

03:30.543 --> 03:31.828
You hungry?

03:32.003 --> 03:33.789
I'll get you something.
What do you want?

03:33.963 --> 03:35.373
What do I want?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.584
Yeah, to eat.
What do you want?

03:37.759 --> 03:38.839
Anything?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.295
Sure. Whatever.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.835
Really?
Anything I want?

03:42.013 --> 03:43.253
Dude, yes.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.296
You can have anything.
What do you want?

03:45.475 --> 03:47.431
- Can I have lobster?
- No, you can't have lobster.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.967
What the hell
do you think this is?

03:49.145 --> 03:51.386
Do you have canned pasta
and tomato sauce?

03:51.564 --> 03:54.647
You want orange-y or red?

03:54.817 --> 03:55.977
Orange-y.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.562
All right.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.692
What about pickles?
l-l like pickles.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.447
We're out of pickles.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.654
What about
potato chips?

04:05.828 --> 04:07.204
We got chips.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.862
Number 42 makes them.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.407
Number 42 is a coding system
for persons here?

04:12.585 --> 04:14.416
For the workers, yeah.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.703
They make
said chips fresh?

04:16.881 --> 04:18.963
Yeah,
they got a kettle--

04:19.133 --> 04:20.589
No, thanks.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.506
Okay.
I'll be back in 10.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.137
Enjoy your new place.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.389
(door creaks)

04:30.186 --> 04:32.268
(birds chirping in distance)

04:37.402 --> 04:39.893
(inhales deeply)

04:47.996 --> 04:52.285
(shuddered breathing)

04:54.877 --> 04:56.413
J‘ We're on Easy Street J‘

04:57.880 --> 05:01.008
J‘ And it feels so sweet J‘

05:01.175 --> 05:02.881
J‘ 'Cause the world
is but a treat J‘

05:03.052 --> 05:05.668
J‘ When you're on Easy Street J‘

05:05.847 --> 05:07.838
J‘ And we're breaking out
the good champagne J“

05:08.016 --> 05:09.301
.l‘ l'm sittin' pretty... .l‘

05:19.152 --> 05:23.020
(knock on door to the tune of
"Shave and a Haircut")

05:31.539 --> 05:32.904
(men grunting, fists thudding)

05:43.760 --> 05:46.672
(music playing)

06:32.350 --> 06:34.011
(pounding on door)

06:34.185 --> 06:37.097
Negan:
Good mornin', sunshine.

06:37.271 --> 06:40.559
Is it just as cozy
as you remember?

06:40.733 --> 06:43.145
You spent a lot of time
on the wrong side of the door

06:43.319 --> 06:47.779
after that stupid road trip
with the wife and Tina.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.985
So let's talk about now.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.491
We went out looking
for your little failed project

06:52.662 --> 06:54.778
for a few hours,
just around the perimeter--

06:54.956 --> 06:56.662
tip to taint,
as it were--

06:56.833 --> 06:59.575
right about the time
I had you thrown in here,

06:59.752 --> 07:01.583
and when I got back,

07:01.754 --> 07:04.245
I realized I...

07:04.424 --> 07:06.540
was short...

07:06.717 --> 07:08.332
a wife.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.511
Which one?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.297
Sherry.

07:16.978 --> 07:20.141
You know anything about that,
Dwighty boy?

07:20.314 --> 07:22.396
'Cause I got to tell you,

07:22.567 --> 07:25.730
that is one hell of a coincidence,

07:25.903 --> 07:30.738
her leaving just a few short
hours after Daryl took off.

07:30.908 --> 07:34.196
Oh, and he didn't
force his way out.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.450
No.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.328
Somebody opened the door
for him.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.168
It wasn't Sherry.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.931
(Negan whispers)
Dwighty boy...

07:57.101 --> 07:59.183
was it you?

08:01.397 --> 08:03.604
Did it work
the other way around?

08:03.774 --> 08:05.856
You were supposed to
break him.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.267
Did he break you?

08:07.445 --> 08:09.436
I mean,
let's face it--

08:09.614 --> 08:13.653
you've got some
pretty legitimate grievances.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.535
You change your stripes
on me, Dwighty?

08:17.705 --> 08:21.368
You startin'
to see things different?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.951
(pounding on door)

08:28.257 --> 08:31.169
After all this...

08:31.344 --> 08:34.507
before and after...

08:34.680 --> 08:39.390
hell, after everything...

08:41.854 --> 08:44.231
who are you, Dwight?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.808
I'm Negan.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.564
(Negan sighs)

08:54.742 --> 08:58.326
(lock clicks, door opens)

09:00.456 --> 09:03.789
(door creaks)

09:25.898 --> 09:29.811
Daryl isn't like you.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.692
He's...

09:31.862 --> 09:34.114
emotional.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.573
So he's either
on his way home,

09:37.743 --> 09:39.654
or he's coming
back here

09:39.829 --> 09:42.161
to try to kill
some more of us.

09:42.331 --> 09:45.539
Mostly you and me.

09:45.710 --> 09:50.044
Either way,
we'll find him.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.957
So...

09:55.052 --> 09:56.667
do you think you know
where Sherry went?

09:56.846 --> 09:59.303
(sighs)

09:59.473 --> 10:01.464
Yeah.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.349
Bring her back.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.852
Sort it out.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.228
Stitch him up.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.647
Fix what you can fix.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.986
You don't think
she did it?

10:24.165 --> 10:26.406
You think she did?

10:26.584 --> 10:28.540
I got to know her
a little bit.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.826
Not well.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.417
Well enough to know
what happened.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.583
She saw Daryl in here,
in the state he was in.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.171
She let him go.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.211
She was soft.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.595
She has a big heart.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.382
You were just beaten
and thrown in a cell--

10:44.560 --> 10:46.096
unfairly, if you ask me.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.511
And you're back to it.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.853
You may wind up running
an outpost for him.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.063
You get it.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.364
I like to think that I do.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.616
The type of selfless,
tender soul

11:06.791 --> 11:10.534
who would marry Negan
to save her husband's life?

11:10.711 --> 11:13.544
That's exactly the kind of
person who really isn't...

11:13.714 --> 11:15.545
expected
to be around anymore.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.421
Thanks.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.847
Just trying to help.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.227
(motorcycle engine starts)

12:29.498 --> 12:32.706
(engine revving)

12:36.213 --> 12:38.545
Laura: Stuff people grow,
stuff people make,

12:38.716 --> 12:41.002
stuff, you know,
people scavenge.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.260
Beer, bread,
cut your head.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.510
Eugene:
Cut your what?

12:45.681 --> 12:47.262
Barber.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.139
Might be able to kill
that thing on your head.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.301
(chatter)

12:53.731 --> 12:55.596
We use
a points system.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.141
You're one of us now,
not them.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.106
They eat shit,
we eat good.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.272
Write what you took
or what they did,

13:04.450 --> 13:06.361
how much it was worth,
sign your name.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.912
That's it.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.371
Hey!

13:14.210 --> 13:15.746
Must be your lucky day,
haircut.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.126
Are these homemade?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.207
Man: Yeah.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.714
That's some good
DIY stuff there.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.139
No-- no, thank you.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.347
You want something...

13:38.526 --> 13:40.437
' (gasps)
- ...you take it, haircut.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.567
(walkers growling)

13:42.738 --> 13:44.899
Negan: We'll send Simon over
to take a peak,

13:45.074 --> 13:46.780
sort of
good-cop this thing first,

13:46.951 --> 13:48.782
see how far
we get.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.193
There he is.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.907
Man of the hour!

13:52.081 --> 13:54.413
Come on over here,
big fella.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.918
Don't be rude,
asshole.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.208
Say hello.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.466
H-h-hello.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.224
You got a name,
asshole?

14:13.394 --> 14:14.804
Eugene.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.856
Now us.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.809
Who are you?

14:19.984 --> 14:22.600
All: I'm Negan.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.231
Well, Eugene...

14:30.077 --> 14:32.409
...I know
you remember Lucille.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.034
Now, you see this
right here?

14:36.208 --> 14:39.826
You might have to get
real close.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.713
That, my friend,
is the bullet you made.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.419
Now, under normal circumstances,

14:45.593 --> 14:50.963
I'd be showing you that
real close over and over again.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.096
- (tongue clicks)
- (shuddered breathing)

14:53.267 --> 14:54.848
But, Eugene, see,

14:55.019 --> 14:58.807
all I really want to know
is if you are a smarty-pants.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.848
You know things?

15:05.195 --> 15:07.356
Answer the question.

15:10.451 --> 15:14.194
l-- I am, indeed,
a smarty-pants.

15:14.371 --> 15:18.114
I... taught myself
to cast bullets.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.873
I... found a--

15:20.044 --> 15:24.663
found a machine shop
with the necessary...

15:26.050 --> 15:29.668
l-l read a lot, and, um...

15:29.845 --> 15:31.085
although my--

15:31.263 --> 15:34.630
even though my memory
is not considered eidetic,

15:34.808 --> 15:37.299
I don't skim
and I don't scrimp.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.309
If knowledge is dropped,
I do, indeed, pick it up.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.971
(chuckles)

15:42.149 --> 15:46.108
Oh, you really are
just some asshole.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.519
(chucang)

15:52.952 --> 15:55.819
N-no. I'm not.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.082
l have PhDs
in biochemistry,

16:02.252 --> 16:05.335
as well as immunology
and microbiology,

16:05.506 --> 16:08.088
and I've completed my doctorate,
which makes me a doctor.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.714
Prior to the collapse,

16:09.885 --> 16:13.469
I was part of a 10-person team
at the Human Genome Project,

16:13.639 --> 16:15.800
working under
Dr. T. Brooks Ellis

16:15.975 --> 16:19.138
to weaponize diseases
to fight weaponized diseases.

16:19.311 --> 16:23.805
Fire with, uh...
you know... f-fire.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.895
Well, see,
interdepartmental drinks were--

16:27.069 --> 16:28.855
(walker growling)

16:33.450 --> 16:35.862
Uh-huh.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.322
All right, then,
Dr. Smarty-pants.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.613
You ought to be able
to crack this

16:40.791 --> 16:43.453
without breaking a sweat.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.618
You see, I have a lot of
free labor here at the fence--

16:45.796 --> 16:48.788
living dead pricks
that help keep the riffraff out.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.752
Problem is,
they don't keep.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.166
They fall apart.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.677
Like that
poor sack of...

16:55.848 --> 16:58.260
pile of shit there.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.050
So, Dr. Smarty-pants,

17:03.439 --> 17:05.555
how do we keep them
on their feet?

17:10.154 --> 17:11.564
Uh...

17:13.157 --> 17:16.649
(sighs)

17:19.163 --> 17:21.199
You, um...

17:21.373 --> 17:24.160
smelt on the regs,
correct?

17:25.586 --> 17:28.077
I saw that among the
legacy equipment on the floor

17:28.255 --> 17:30.291
that you possess
an operational smelter.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.797
And?

17:32.968 --> 17:36.756
You already possess the means
to resolve your issue.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.421
Step one,
melt down scrap metal.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.807
Step two, pour it over
the compromised walker

17:41.977 --> 17:44.719
as they are in contact
with the chain link.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.013
The liquid metal
will harden...

17:47.191 --> 17:50.228
both maintaining
bodily integrity for the walker

17:50.402 --> 17:53.189
as well as affixing them
to the fence.

17:53.363 --> 17:56.025
Bonus points
for covering their head

17:56.200 --> 17:57.440
and protecting them
from head trauma

17:57.618 --> 18:00.405
from hostiles
and calamities.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.116
God damn!

18:07.294 --> 18:10.832
If that ain't the coolest thing
I've ever heard in my life!

18:11.006 --> 18:15.420
Not only is that practical,
it is just bad-ass!

18:16.428 --> 18:17.543
Whoa.

18:17.721 --> 18:22.636
Look at you,
Dr. Smarty-pants.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.516
(shuddered breathing)

18:24.686 --> 18:29.601
Did Rick have you doing this
kind of valuable stuff for him?

18:31.652 --> 18:33.859
Oh.

18:34.029 --> 18:38.489
His loss, our gain.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.115
I feel like
I need to give you

18:40.285 --> 18:41.786
some kind of
signing bonus here.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.071
Uh, w-well, I wa--
I was gifted these pickles.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.956
(chuckles)

18:48.127 --> 18:49.708
Ahh.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.379
No.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.711
As a token of my gratitude,
I'm gonna send you over

18:55.884 --> 18:57.715
a few of my wives
to your apartment tonight,

18:57.886 --> 18:59.672
show you
a good time.

18:59.847 --> 19:03.465
Now, I don't think
I have to worry about this.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.679
But who knows
how truly smart you are?

19:06.854 --> 19:09.436
No sex.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.848
That is
a grave no-no.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.563
However,
you can have a little dinner,

19:15.737 --> 19:18.774
some drinks,
share a few laughs.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.531
There is nothing like
beautiful women that smell good

19:21.702 --> 19:24.865
to make you feel
human again.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.701
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

19:30.085 --> 19:33.327
D-d-did you say "wives,"
meaning plural?

19:33.505 --> 19:35.712
Hell yes,
I did.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.424
What does
Dr. Smarty-pants say

19:39.595 --> 19:42.507
to his knew bestest friend
in the whole wide world?

19:44.933 --> 19:47.140
(whistles)

19:47.311 --> 19:49.893
What does he say?

19:50.063 --> 19:51.974
Thank you.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.355
Fully, completely...

19:53.525 --> 19:57.734
sincerely,
seriously... thank you.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.272
Okay.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.527
Why don't you
go have some fun?

20:23.889 --> 20:26.801
(video game beeping)

20:29.144 --> 20:30.850
Tanya: What the hell
am I even looking at?

20:31.021 --> 20:33.683
The insect-like creature
is called a Yar.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.188
It is attempting
to exact revenge

20:35.359 --> 20:38.977
upon the evil Qotile
for the destruction of Razak IV.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.398
Maybe you should
take it easy, Amber.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.568
Maybe I shouldn't,
Frankie.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.737
Uh, we could
play something else.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.996
Warlords?

20:52.167 --> 20:54.408
It's four-player
and quite the hoot.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.826
Whatever you want.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.086
This is your night.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.967
Do you want
a massage?

21:04.137 --> 21:05.217
Negan loves them.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.845
And I was
a licensed therapist.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.347
You know, before.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.053
Mm.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.560
Mm.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.395
While I appreciate
the gesture

21:19.569 --> 21:21.184
and your commitment
to your assigned objective,

21:21.363 --> 21:23.649
lam fully aware that none of
you ladies are here this evening

21:23.824 --> 21:25.439
of your own volition.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.576
Video games are all about me
showing all of you a fun time.

21:29.746 --> 21:32.829
Would you care
for more microwave popcorn?

21:35.210 --> 21:37.041
Hey, just because
this was Negan's idea

21:37.212 --> 21:39.168
doesn't mean
that we don't want to be here.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.081
I'd be down with just having
an intelligent conversation.

21:43.176 --> 21:47.385
Well, I suppose a conversation
would be acceptable

21:47.556 --> 21:49.217
under the current
circumstance.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.632
What would you like
to talk about?

21:51.810 --> 21:54.893
Uh, how about
the Human Genome Project?

21:55.063 --> 21:57.270
I could talk about that shit
all night.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.229
(popcorn kernels rattling)

22:02.654 --> 22:03.734
In truth...

22:03.905 --> 22:06.487
the bulk of my work
for the HGP

22:06.658 --> 22:08.694
fell under the auspices
of the Black Box Program,

22:08.869 --> 22:11.656
of which lam not
at liberty to discuss.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.287
In all likelihood,
even if! could,

22:14.458 --> 22:16.540
it'd probably escape
your comprehension.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.450
Did he just insult us,
Tanya?

22:18.628 --> 22:19.708
It was not a dis.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.087
It was simply
a statement of fact.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.090
My intelligence
has been objectively measured.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.342
I am fully
a man apart.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.252
So, what, are you, like,
one of those guys

22:29.431 --> 22:30.591
who can make a bomb

22:30.766 --> 22:32.097
out of bleach
and a toothpick or something?

22:32.267 --> 22:33.882
Of course not.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.302
That would at least require
dry yeast, hydrogen peroxide,

22:36.480 --> 22:37.890
and a small amount
of liquid dish soap,

22:38.065 --> 22:40.556
maybe some, you know,
bathroom or drain cleaner,

22:40.734 --> 22:42.725
some balloons
or something like that,

22:42.903 --> 22:44.985
few other
common household sundries.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.939
Seriously?

22:49.951 --> 22:51.532
Eugene:
Serious as sepsis.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.542
(insects chirping)

23:11.306 --> 23:12.512
So stupid.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.467
I'm hoping to illustrate
the opposite.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.930
Just slaves?

23:18.105 --> 23:19.220
Excuse me?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.309
(sighs)
Whatever.

23:26.154 --> 23:31.649
Dr. Eugene, did you just
make helium out of toilet stuff?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.242
Hydrogen.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.778
Oh.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.992
(door opens)

23:38.166 --> 23:40.578
It's cool, Keno.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.743
We're good.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.167
Hey. Relax.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.755
You're one of us.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.598
I should disclose in advance

24:01.773 --> 24:05.015
I may have oversold this one
by classifying it as a bomb.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.809
As the hydrogen peroxide
decomposes,

24:07.988 --> 24:09.819
the reaction will release energy
in the form of heat.

24:09.990 --> 24:13.073
Dr. Eugene, can you please
just show us some good shit?

24:13.243 --> 24:14.323
(both laugh)

24:14.494 --> 24:16.234
(laughs)

24:23.211 --> 24:24.621
I'm gonna light
this candle.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.206
- Cool!
- Finally.

24:26.381 --> 24:27.621
(both laugh)

24:27.799 --> 24:29.130
No, I mean,
I'm gonna light this candle.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.257
(both laugh)

24:32.554 --> 24:33.885
(lighter clicks)

24:35.599 --> 24:38.215
(chuckles)

24:41.813 --> 24:43.053
Oh, no.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.437
(both laugh)

24:44.608 --> 24:47.941
(humming to the tune of
"1812 Overture")

24:52.824 --> 24:55.691
(laughter)

24:55.869 --> 24:57.234
(explosion)

24:57.412 --> 24:59.528
(screams, laughter)

24:59.706 --> 25:00.786
Yay!

25:00.957 --> 25:02.697
Yeah!

25:02.876 --> 25:05.333
(both laugh)

25:05.504 --> 25:06.869
Yeah!

25:07.047 --> 25:09.163
(chuckles)

25:09.341 --> 25:10.421
Mm.

25:10.592 --> 25:13.174
(both laugh)

25:31.488 --> 25:35.231
Honey?

25:55.095 --> 25:58.212
Sherry: D-- we always said
that if we got separated,

25:58.390 --> 26:00.972
I should come back here
and wait for you.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.303
You'd show up
with beer and pretzels.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.514
You remember that?

26:05.689 --> 26:06.929
I know.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.519
You probably don't.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.949
You always said
that when we started dating,

26:19.119 --> 26:22.862
you forgot to tell me
you had a shitty memory.

26:23.039 --> 26:26.202
You used to get so frustrated
by it...

26:26.376 --> 26:30.244
knowing you wouldn't remember
those good days...

26:30.422 --> 26:32.037
those special days.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.974
I felt bad for you.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.509
I remember you said
there was so much

26:45.687 --> 26:47.552
you wanted to hold on to,

26:47.731 --> 26:50.097
and then it'd be gone.

26:50.275 --> 26:55.360
But you're lucky
you don't remember things, D.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.275
I wish I could wait for you now.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.570
But I don't know
if you'd come with me

27:04.748 --> 27:07.034
or if you'd take me back there

27:07.208 --> 27:08.914
or you'd kill me.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.585
You didn't want to live
in that world,

27:12.756 --> 27:14.337
and I made you.

27:16.176 --> 27:20.510
I did what I did because
I didn't want you to die.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.179
But now you've killed,

27:23.350 --> 27:26.808
and you've become everything
you didn't want to be,

27:26.978 --> 27:29.264
and it's my fault.

27:29.439 --> 27:32.351
You were better than me.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.732
Most people are.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.143
I let Daryl go

27:37.322 --> 27:39.563
because he reminded you
of who you used to be.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.108
And I wanted to let you forget.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.376
I don't think
I'm gonna make it out here,

27:54.547 --> 27:56.799
but you're wrong.

27:58.134 --> 28:01.877
Being there isn't better
than being dead.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.716
It's worse.

28:04.724 --> 28:08.512
I hope you realize that.
I hope you get away.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.225
I hope you remember
the good days,

28:12.399 --> 28:14.981
even just one of them, but...

28:15.151 --> 28:17.267
I don't think you will.

28:17.445 --> 28:20.937
I don't think
you'll ever read this.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.357
I loved who you were.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.277
I'm sorry
I made you into who you are.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.612
Good-bye.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.452
Honey.

29:06.494 --> 29:09.657
(sighs)

29:29.100 --> 29:30.431
(knock on door)

29:30.602 --> 29:34.720
Tanya: We can hear the Yars
and the Qotile, Eugene.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.225
l was given to understand
that last night's shinny

29:40.403 --> 29:42.644
was supposed to be
a singular incident.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.108
He didn't send us.

29:47.327 --> 29:49.238
We need your help.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.993
You saw Amber
last night.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.333
She just drinks
and cries.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.046
She didn't want this.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.424
Um, we signed up for it.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.130
It's better for us.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.137
She had to.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.138
Her mom needed meds.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.644
She can't work.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.224
Amber thought...

30:21.402 --> 30:24.144
that she could
live with it.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.403
She can't.

30:29.577 --> 30:32.068
She asked us
to help her end it.

30:35.416 --> 30:38.158
You aren't afforded any...

30:38.336 --> 30:40.497
mental-health services?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.628
Tanya: No.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.209
Are you serious?

30:44.384 --> 30:46.045
I mean, there's
a licensed masseuse here.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.504
Uh, odds being
what they are--

30:47.679 --> 30:49.590
There's no one
like that here.

30:50.765 --> 30:54.599
So this... is it.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.385
She just wants
to take something.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.931
She wants to go to sleep
and not wake up.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.021
That would be
wildly irresponsible.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.937
She dies at night,
in her sleep,

31:07.115 --> 31:10.198
she turns while everyone
is asleep...

31:10.368 --> 31:11.904
We'll handle that part.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.911
We were hoping that you could
make something for her,

31:15.081 --> 31:17.413
'cause we know
that you can make things.

31:17.584 --> 31:20.792
Look, I know that this is crazy
and you barely know us...

31:20.962 --> 31:24.420
but we can tell
that you are a good man.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.831
(scoffs)

31:27.719 --> 31:30.005
There aren't
many of those left.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.138
(inhales deeply)

31:34.309 --> 31:37.642
Truth of the matter is,
I'm not good.

31:40.023 --> 31:43.060
I'm not lawful,
neutral, or chaotic--

31:43.234 --> 31:44.815
none of the above.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.033
Are you saying
you can't do it?

31:57.665 --> 32:00.452
Lack of ability
is not the problem here.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.618
I could jerry-rig
a lethal toxin

32:02.795 --> 32:05.923
with the assets
at hand here, no problemo.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.251
- l have the--
- Then help us.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.008
A pill, a shot,
whatever.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.342
We need
two of them.

32:14.515 --> 32:15.971
'Cause we don't know
when we could get our chance.

32:16.142 --> 32:20.511
Frankie: She's gonna do it,
with or without us.

32:20.688 --> 32:23.930
She'll suffer, and maybe
someone else will get hurt.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.727
You are good,
Eugene.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.112
You have to be.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.578
How much
does she weigh?

32:43.753 --> 32:47.211
Don't know.
Maybe 120.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.998
Why?

32:50.176 --> 32:52.667
If you could get me
her exact weight,

32:52.845 --> 32:56.053
I could guarantee a
semi-precise T.O. pain-free D.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.135
A.S.A.P.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.988
(indistinct conversations)

33:25.753 --> 33:27.368
Best I can do
for now.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.707
Come back later.

33:28.881 --> 33:31.133
We're playing poker
with some guys.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.506
Try to hook you up.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.759
You kidding?
Can't play poker.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.260
I got to be
out diggin' postholes

33:36.431 --> 33:37.637
at the crack
of dawn tomorrow.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.172
I would like
a single blister pack

33:39.350 --> 33:40.965
of your most extra-strength
cold capsule.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.384
Woman: Hey.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.928
The line's a line!

33:45.106 --> 33:47.313
What, they not have them
where you come from?

33:47.483 --> 33:48.984
You don't know
how they work?

33:49.152 --> 33:50.267
No,
I am familiar--

33:50.445 --> 33:51.685
Get in it,
prick.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.501
What is your number?

34:11.174 --> 34:12.414
What's yours?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.002
16.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.838
All right,
number 16.

34:16.012 --> 34:19.049
My name
is Dr. Eugene Porter.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.429
I've recently
been appointed

34:20.600 --> 34:24.058
to the newly created post
of Chief Engineer of this facility.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.934
I report
directly to Negan,

34:26.105 --> 34:28.687
which means you report
directly to my ass.

34:33.946 --> 34:36.938
The cold capsules, now.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.526
I didn't know.

34:38.701 --> 34:43.320
We just-- we get so many
new faces, I didn't...

34:58.930 --> 35:01.137
I want this, too.

35:01.307 --> 35:02.808
And this.

35:04.852 --> 35:07.229
I don't even know
what you call this.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.557
I'm gonna call it
a Gremblygunk.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.271
(They Might Be Giants' "Everything Right
Is Wrong Again" plays)

35:19.450 --> 35:22.066
J‘ Everything right
is wrong again J‘

35:22.245 --> 35:24.486
J‘ Just like
in the long, long trailer J‘

35:24.664 --> 35:27.280
J‘ All the dishes got broken
and the car kept driving J‘

35:27.458 --> 35:31.121
J‘ And nobody
would stop to save her J‘

35:32.213 --> 35:34.295
J‘ Wake me when it's over,
touch my face J‘

35:34.465 --> 35:37.081
J‘ Tell me every word
has been erased J“

35:37.260 --> 35:39.091
J‘ Don't you want
to know the reason J“

35:39.262 --> 35:41.469
- J‘ Why the cupboard's not appealing? J‘
- Did you find her?

35:44.684 --> 35:46.299
Where is she?

35:46.477 --> 35:48.263
I killed her.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.516
She ran away from me
right into a mess of dead ones,

35:55.695 --> 35:58.311
so, I, uh...
made it quick.

36:00.491 --> 36:01.776
Mm.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.693
It still hurts.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.532
Feels better
with a bandage.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.412
I wasn't talking
about that.

36:10.084 --> 36:12.120
I would tell you to just
forget about her, but...

36:12.295 --> 36:13.660
(chuckles)

36:13.838 --> 36:15.044
...I don't see anyone else
doing that anytime soon,

36:15.214 --> 36:16.454
considering
what she did.

36:18.926 --> 36:20.882
Oh, we've all done things.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.837
Yes,
but before we got here,

36:25.016 --> 36:27.052
before we understood...

36:27.226 --> 36:28.261
we were cowards
about it.

36:31.105 --> 36:35.348
We don't-- we don't
get to have big hearts.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.734
Remember that.

36:46.871 --> 36:49.328
Eugene:
Wh-what is this?

36:49.498 --> 36:51.079
You'll find out.

37:41.092 --> 37:46.632
You are gonna want to pay
close attention to this.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.466
Ohh!

37:51.644 --> 37:53.976
(breathing heavily)
No, no, no, no!

37:54.146 --> 37:55.431
Why?
(Doctor chokes)

37:55.606 --> 37:57.107
I didn't do anything.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.142
I found
this little souvenir

38:00.319 --> 38:02.651
tucked away in your desk.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.062
I-I-I don't know
what that is.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.982
(sighs)

38:08.911 --> 38:10.867
Unh!

38:11.038 --> 38:12.574
(coughs)

38:12.748 --> 38:15.330
(clears throat)

38:23.926 --> 38:26.212
(sighs)

38:26.387 --> 38:27.627
You...

38:27.805 --> 38:30.797
left the door open
and let my puppy out.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.761
Mnh-mnh.

38:34.854 --> 38:38.017
You knew Sherry
hated Daryl being here,

38:38.190 --> 38:41.432
so you let him out for her,
be the hero.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.692
Then you could
move in.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.148
That...

38:45.323 --> 38:48.486
is some weaselly shit
right there.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.695
But I didn't.
She's the one who ran--

38:50.870 --> 38:52.076
Oh, she ran?

38:52.246 --> 38:54.737
You know
why she ran?!

38:54.915 --> 38:59.284
Because she knew
I would blame her, which...

38:59.462 --> 39:01.043
Idid.

39:02.048 --> 39:05.506
But, see, Sherry told
Dwighty boy the whole story

39:05.676 --> 39:08.292
right before
she was torn apart.

39:08.471 --> 39:12.305
A super hot girl,
horrifically killed

39:12.475 --> 39:14.431
because of your greedy,
delusional,

39:14.602 --> 39:16.308
tiny little prick.

39:16.479 --> 39:17.639
It's not true.
Dwight?

39:19.732 --> 39:22.348
He's lying about it.
I would never do that.

39:22.526 --> 39:24.357
Why? Why?
Why would he do that?

39:24.528 --> 39:27.770
Why would he intentionally
try to hurt you?

39:27.948 --> 39:29.028
Sherry's gone.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.781
And if he's lying...

39:32.203 --> 39:34.114
and she's out there,
I will find her.

39:34.288 --> 39:37.325
And then Iwill burn
the other side of his face off

39:37.500 --> 39:39.036
until he dies.

39:39.210 --> 39:43.453
So, what was he gonna get
out of this?

39:45.925 --> 39:47.131
No.

39:47.301 --> 39:48.541
No.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.256
You see,
I know my Dwighty boy.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.297
See, all he needed...

39:54.475 --> 39:56.887
was one more night
in the hole,

39:57.061 --> 39:59.848
get his head
screwed on straight.

40:01.023 --> 40:03.184
It worked before,
and it worked now.

40:03.359 --> 40:05.771
Ain't that right,
Dwight?

40:05.945 --> 40:07.355
Oh, yeah.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.911
(crying)
No, please.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.166
No, please.

40:23.337 --> 40:24.838
Please, please, please!

40:25.005 --> 40:26.165
Oh, Jesus,
don't burn me.

40:26.340 --> 40:27.750
Please!

40:27.925 --> 40:29.381
Please!

40:29.552 --> 40:31.042
No.

40:32.471 --> 40:34.052
No, no, please!

40:34.223 --> 40:36.009
Now you know
I hate this shit.

40:36.183 --> 40:38.765
Just tell me you did it
and that you're sorry,

40:38.936 --> 40:40.642
and I don't have to do this.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.178
Yes.

40:42.356 --> 40:46.065
Yes, I did it--
all of it.

40:46.235 --> 40:49.318
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.364
Please...

40:55.870 --> 40:57.110
I'm sorry.

41:04.211 --> 41:05.667
- (groans)
- (iron clanks)

41:05.838 --> 41:07.544
That's all
you had to say.

41:07.715 --> 41:11.549
That is all
you had to say.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.343
(sighs)

41:22.313 --> 41:24.395
(screaming)

41:32.823 --> 41:35.280
(sighs)

41:35.451 --> 41:39.740
(crying)

41:51.926 --> 41:53.257
(chuckles)

41:54.887 --> 41:57.469
A good thing we got
a spare Dr. Carson.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.471
I trust you, Dwighty boy.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.473
I never shoulda doubted you.

42:02.978 --> 42:05.390
Sherry was
one of my favorites.

42:05.564 --> 42:06.940
I'm sorry.

42:07.107 --> 42:08.358
I'm not.

42:10.277 --> 42:11.483
Hoo.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.610
Ice-cold.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.988
I love it.

42:29.588 --> 42:31.670
(knock on door)

42:33.217 --> 42:35.959
(knock on door)

42:36.136 --> 42:37.672
Come.

42:39.473 --> 42:42.715
(door creaks)

42:42.893 --> 42:45.225
Hello.

42:45.396 --> 42:46.977
Are you all right?

42:47.147 --> 42:48.307
(door closes)

42:48.482 --> 42:50.063
Better than that.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.901
You can call next,
but it might be a while.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.481
Oh.

42:58.117 --> 43:00.779
Did you make
the pills?

43:00.953 --> 43:02.739
Idid.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.949
But you can't
have them.

43:10.879 --> 43:13.165
Amber's counting on us.

43:13.340 --> 43:14.841
We told her
that you were gonna help us,

43:15.009 --> 43:16.749
- and she says that she--
- Pump your brakes, Red.

43:16.927 --> 43:19.669
Do not insult
my intelligence, Frankie.

43:20.848 --> 43:21.837
Said pills
aren't for Amber.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.677
Said pills
are for Negan.

43:23.851 --> 43:25.762
That's why
you wanted two.

43:27.896 --> 43:30.023
Didn't he kill
your friends?

43:30.190 --> 43:31.646
Several.

43:33.110 --> 43:36.352
But I imagine we killed
about 30 or so of his.

43:36.530 --> 43:37.895
Turnabout
and all that.

43:39.033 --> 43:42.241
Give us the pills
or we'll tell Negan about it.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.777
We'll tell him that
it was your idea to make them

43:44.955 --> 43:47.241
and that you tried
to get us to help.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.748
That would be a tactical error
on your part.

43:49.918 --> 43:51.294
They'll believe me
overyou

43:51.462 --> 43:54.795
for the same reason he believed
Dwight over the doctor.

43:54.965 --> 43:58.207
You're replaceable to him.

43:58.385 --> 43:59.761
I, on the other hand,
am not.

43:59.928 --> 44:02.180
You're a coward.

44:05.184 --> 44:07.220
You're a coward.

44:07.394 --> 44:10.306
That is a correct assessment.

44:19.365 --> 44:22.949
(door closes)

44:45.015 --> 44:49.008
(knock on door to the tune of
"Shave and a Haircut")

45:03.659 --> 45:07.151
(door creaks)

45:20.175 --> 45:22.757
May I come in?

45:33.480 --> 45:35.641
So, how you
liking it here?

45:37.484 --> 45:40.396
Are we doing right
by Dr. Smarty-pants?

45:43.741 --> 45:45.902
You know,
Frankie and Tanya...

45:46.076 --> 45:48.818
nothing but good things
to say about you.

45:53.917 --> 45:55.327
(sighs)

45:55.502 --> 45:57.458
It's all right.

45:57.629 --> 45:59.039
I get it.

46:00.132 --> 46:02.794
I know how hard it can be
to accept change,

46:02.968 --> 46:05.334
to get on
the right team.

46:05.512 --> 46:08.424
But I need you
to understand something.

46:09.892 --> 46:13.805
I do not make this invitation
to everyone.

46:15.105 --> 46:18.188
And I sure as shit

46:18.358 --> 46:21.191
do not make it lightly.

46:21.361 --> 46:24.353
(shuddered breathing)

46:24.531 --> 46:26.146
Hey.

46:26.325 --> 46:27.906
Hey!

46:29.703 --> 46:33.867
You do not need
to be scared anymore.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.661
You don't need
to be scared.

46:39.004 --> 46:41.791
You just have to answer me
one question.

46:41.965 --> 46:44.217
And it's a big one.

46:46.553 --> 46:47.633
Who are--

46:47.805 --> 46:49.011
I'm Negan.

46:49.181 --> 46:53.424
I'm utterly, completely,
stone-cold Negan.

46:55.437 --> 46:56.722
l was Negan
before I even met you.

46:56.897 --> 47:00.560
ljust needed
to meet you properly to know.

47:00.734 --> 47:02.099
I'm Negan.

47:08.742 --> 47:10.573
Eugene:Hey,
be careful with that.

47:10.744 --> 47:13.577
(walkers growling)

47:13.747 --> 47:15.408
Hey, you want to get burned
by molten metal?

47:15.582 --> 47:18.119
'Cause that's exactly how
you get burned by molten metal.

47:43.777 --> 47:45.017
Regarding me
clamping down--

47:45.195 --> 47:46.355
You on board?

47:46.530 --> 47:48.566
lam.
Just like you.

47:50.951 --> 47:52.031
Don't know
if you recall my handle--

47:52.202 --> 47:53.612
I don't.

47:53.787 --> 47:56.574
Eugene.

47:56.748 --> 47:57.954
You're Dwight.

48:03.422 --> 48:05.208
We are Negan.

48:08.635 --> 48:10.466
Yeah.
