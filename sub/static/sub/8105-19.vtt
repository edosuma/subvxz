WEBVTT

00:28.570 --> 00:30.446
Do you feel the Spirit?

00:37.996 --> 00:41.916
And in the 39th year of his reign,
Asa was diseased in his feet

00:42.042 --> 00:43.793
until the disease was exceedingly great,

00:43.919 --> 00:49.507
yet he didn't seek help from the Lord,
but from the physicians.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.969
Now, there is nothing wrong
with seeing a doctor.

00:53.095 --> 00:57.515
But can a doctor heal through the power
that Jesus gave his disciples?

00:57.641 --> 01:00.268
Men of science can walk through life
with blindfolds,

01:00.394 --> 01:02.895
never knowing that you or I
could not take a single step

01:03.021 --> 01:05.106
if we were not uplifted by God.

01:11.155 --> 01:16.617
Agnes, thank you for letting me be
an instrument of God's love for you.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.137
In faith...

01:37.389 --> 01:39.056
...all things are possible.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.938
My friends, I want you to let Agnes

01:46.064 --> 01:48.483
feel the wave of faith
in this church here today,

01:48.609 --> 01:51.068
lifting her into God's hands.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.156
Praise God!

01:55.282 --> 01:57.617
You can do it. Come on, sister.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.753
Praise Jesus!

02:08.879 --> 02:10.254
Thanks be to God!

02:11.340 --> 02:14.008
Thank you, Lord! Thanks be to God!

02:14.134 --> 02:15.760
Thank you, Lord!

02:31.735 --> 02:33.903
- Is he all right?
- No!

02:37.366 --> 02:39.075
My son!

02:40.619 --> 02:43.371
Daddy, I think I need a doctor.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.248
Didn't remember my DVD player?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.708
Well, if you wanted it,

03:28.834 --> 03:30.918
you shouldn't have left it behind
when you moved out.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.380
I get it.
It's a drag watching porn on VHS.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.924
I'll call you
as soon as I'm done with it.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.801
That's if you ever get
a phone installed.

03:38.927 --> 03:43.556
Oh, forget it. I'll come by
and get it myself. After work, Thursday?

03:44.600 --> 03:45.850
Won't be home Thursday.

03:45.976 --> 03:49.061
No problem. I still have a key,
I can let myself in and out.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.230
I guess maybe I could
bring it in tomorrow.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.608
After all, how many times
can you hit "pause"

03:53.734 --> 03:56.611
at the part where Lindsay Lohan
wins the spelling bee?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.195
What is it about girls who can spell?

03:58.322 --> 04:01.908
- It's a math contest.
- What is it about girls who can count?

04:02.034 --> 04:04.076
It's poker night, isn't it?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.120
You said weeks ago that I could play.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.997
- Stop making excuses.
- Gotta go!

04:08.123 --> 04:11.334
Building full of sick people.
If I hurry, maybe I can avoid them.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.671
The abdominal series showed
no evidence of obstruction.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.299
- What did you have to eat?
- Chicken sandwich.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.259
We travel, lots of fast food.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.139
Thank you, I barely felt it.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.934
You're welcome.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.061
God told me you were kind.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.898
You talk to God?

04:34.024 --> 04:37.443
God's presence often descends on Boyd
to help him guide others.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.071
- This been going on long?
- Since he was 10.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.909
God told me
I would meet a woman healer

04:45.035 --> 04:49.205
who was harboring vengeful thoughts
about a man she works with.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.625
That's God's job.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.629
I'll keep that in mind.

04:58.382 --> 05:01.342
- His urine is dilute.
- What does that mean?

05:01.468 --> 05:04.011
Could mean that for some reason
his kidneys aren't purifying

05:04.137 --> 05:07.181
the way they should, which would
let toxins accumulate in his body.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.892
We'll run the blood work
and see what it tells us.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.144
Thank you, I appreciate it.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.609
God talks to him?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.945
It's not psychosis. He's just religious.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.198
The only medical issue that showed up
on the blood work is low sodium.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.702
No. You talk to God, you're religious.
God talks to you, you're psychotic.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.912
A lot of people experience
their religion

05:30.038 --> 05:31.706
as something more than symbolic.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.873
That doesn't mean...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.835
God ever talk to you
when you were in the seminary?

05:38.046 --> 05:40.923
- No.
- God's loss, our gain.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.175
He's either psychotic or a scam artist.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.636
He was actually really impressive.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.848
Well, yeah, with the burning bush
and all, it's quite the show.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.934
He was intelligent, polite, dignified.
He's not a typical 15-year-old.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.811
And he told Cameron God wants her

05:53.937 --> 05:56.147
to stop being pissed at me
over the article.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.774
God knows you stole Cameron's article?

05:58.900 --> 06:01.652
He knows she's harboring
vengeful thoughts.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.695
I'm over it.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.699
I could tell that from the Berlin Wall
of body language between you.

06:06.825 --> 06:11.454
I'm shocked that he picked up on it.
Low sodium. Check for Addison's?

06:11.580 --> 06:13.873
No pigmentation
and potassium levels were normal.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.082
Cirrhosis?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.585
Liver feels fine,
transaminases are normal.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.505
We should monitor his saline
intake to correct the low sodium.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.549
No more than 1 meq per liter, per hour.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.009
Let's push the patient history,

06:25.135 --> 06:27.595
see if there's any evidence of drugs
or other delusions.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.764
I'll take care of it.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.893
You're gonna talk to a patient?

06:34.019 --> 06:35.561
God talks to him.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.230
It'd be arrogant of me to assume that
I'm better than God.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.784
So, you're a faith healer?
Or is that a pejorative?

06:49.910 --> 06:53.412
Do you prefer something like
"divine health management"?

06:55.457 --> 06:57.666
Thought God might have mentioned
that I was coming.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.420
I'm OK with faith healer, Dr House.

07:03.298 --> 07:06.842
That's a nice one.
You didn't even go with,

07:06.968 --> 07:09.428
"I see an H in a medical coat."

07:09.554 --> 07:12.306
- The nurses talk about you a lot.
- Yeah, don't believe them.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.433
I keep a sock in my pants.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.645
Faith. That's another word for
ignorance, isn't it?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.606
I never understood how people could be
so proud of believing in something

07:20.732 --> 07:22.775
with no proof at all.
Like that's an achievement.

07:22.901 --> 07:26.487
God's asking for our trust. You can't
love somebody and not trust them.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.656
Trust has to be earned.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.825
You can't trust someone
hiding in a closet.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.619
You don't trust anyone.

07:35.831 --> 07:39.834
You seem lucid.
There's no confusion, no lethargy.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.418
What drugs have you been taking?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.046
Nothing, some aspirin.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.173
I get focused on something,
I forget to eat,

07:46.299 --> 07:48.217
next thing you know,
I've got a hunger headache.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.636
So, aspirin and hospitals are OK.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.140
That's an interesting attitude for
someone who's kept any number of people

07:54.266 --> 07:56.267
from getting medical help.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.352
Just because I believe in prayer

07:58.478 --> 08:01.480
doesn't mean I don't believe
in germs and toxins.

08:04.818 --> 08:09.947
That bottle's been opened before.
You refilled it at the water cooler.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.740
- Yes.
- How often do you do that?

08:11.867 --> 08:14.577
Few times an hour.
He likes to stay hydrated.

08:16.371 --> 08:20.666
- You think germs might have gotten in?
- I think water might have gotten in.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.218
- We can adjust your pain meds.
- Again.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.972
Suppose we increase your oxycodone?

08:36.099 --> 08:40.144
We both know the only reason
I'm talking lucidly now

08:40.270 --> 08:43.439
is because I did not take my full dose
this morning.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.069
You've done your best

08:49.196 --> 08:51.363
and I have been a good soldier.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.367
It's time we accept it's over.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.706
What about the trip
you were talking about taking?

09:00.832 --> 09:03.459
You've wanted to see Florence
since you were a teenager, right?

09:03.585 --> 09:05.711
Yeah, go now all drugged up?

09:06.546 --> 09:09.381
It's not exactly the trip
I'd been dreaming of.

09:12.052 --> 09:17.097
OK, but you're strong,
you're dealing with this

09:17.224 --> 09:21.852
and there is the right combination of
pain meds out there. And we'll find it.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.230
Don't give up on us.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.150
And don't be startled by the sound
you're about to hear.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.487
Excuse me.

09:31.613 --> 09:35.115
I have a friend with... boundary issues.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.920
- Can this wait five minutes?
- Is she dying?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.171
Yeah.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.799
Before the end of this consult?

09:51.925 --> 09:54.969
They could build monuments
to your self-centeredness.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.932
Patient, 15-year-old, faith healer,
hotline to God.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.435
- What are his symptoms?
- He is not a saint.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.479
He figures out what's going on
in people's lives

10:05.605 --> 10:07.231
by watching, listening, deducing.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.441
And you're worried about
trademark infringement?

10:09.567 --> 10:13.070
Then he passes on advice from God
so he can watch them jump.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.488
It's a power trip.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.783
Oh, and there the similarities end.
Why is he here?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.660
I fear for the human race.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.121
A teenager claims to be the voice of God

10:22.247 --> 10:24.206
and people with advanced degrees
are listening.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.542
The majority of Americans believe in
a personal god.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.878
- What are his symptoms?
- Massive cramps, low sodium.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.880
Turns out he's been
drinking water non-stop,

10:32.007 --> 10:33.716
God told him to purify his body.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.551
Huge water intake
would cause low sodium.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.511
Which would cause the cramping.
Yeah, I got it.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.638
What, that's it? You solved it?

10:41.182 --> 10:44.226
You just brought me out here
to rant because faith annoys you?

10:44.352 --> 10:47.354
Mmm-hmm. He's all better.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.818
You know, I'd get it if people were just
looking for a way to fill the holes.

10:52.944 --> 10:56.322
But they want the holes,
they wanna live in the holes

10:56.448 --> 10:59.700
and they go nuts when someone else
pours dirt in their holes.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.787
Climb out of your holes, people!

11:22.182 --> 11:26.352
Go tell it on the mountain

11:28.396 --> 11:30.356
Over the hills and everywhere

11:30.482 --> 11:34.318
Go tell it on the mountain

11:34.444 --> 11:38.280
That Jesus Christ is born

11:38.406 --> 11:42.326
Go tell it on the mountain

11:42.452 --> 11:46.038
Over the hills and everywhere

11:46.164 --> 11:49.416
Go tell it on the mountain

11:49.542 --> 11:52.252
That Jesus Christ is born

11:52.379 --> 11:55.881
Boyd, are you all right?

11:56.007 --> 11:57.007
Boyd.

12:05.141 --> 12:09.603
Come on, let's go.
Can you tell me your name?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.773
Do you know where you are? Boyd?

12:16.528 --> 12:17.611
Boyd?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.573
God doesn't want you to be afraid.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.327
He sent me here to heal you.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.913
You think he hasn't heard your prayers,
but he heard them all,

12:28.039 --> 12:29.123
even the ones you didn't say.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.458
I'm sorry, Boyd, come on,
let's get you back to your room.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.963
- In faith, all things are possible.
- Let's go.

12:36.089 --> 12:40.426
Lord, I call on you to relieve
the suffering of your daughter...

12:40.552 --> 12:42.761
- Grace?
...and make her whole again.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.389
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
What is this?

12:45.515 --> 12:48.392
He's just had a complex partial seizure.
He's disoriented.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.603
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Well, get him back to his room. Now.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.608
You OK?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.243
Are we certain he even had a seizure?

13:06.369 --> 13:09.621
Him singing and healing,
he does it all the time, doesn't he?

13:09.747 --> 13:11.081
Isn't it interesting

13:11.207 --> 13:13.459
that religious behavior is so close
to being crazy,

13:13.585 --> 13:14.793
we can't tell them apart.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.922
The repetition, the lack of affect
and awareness. It was a seizure.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.883
- Infection?
- No fever.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.344
Could be Wilson's or maybe it's
a glycogen storage disease.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.431
- Or a brain tumor.
- Or tuberous sclerosis.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.850
Hmm.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.727
How to settle this?

13:31.853 --> 13:35.981
We could ask our patient to ask God
or we could MRI his brain.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.816
Which way do you wanna go?
I'm open to all.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.109
- House!
- Yes.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.904
Why the hell do you let an unstable
patient wander the hallways?

13:42.906 --> 13:43.864
His leash broke.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.491
The last thing a terminal patient needs

13:45.617 --> 13:47.326
is to hear somebody
taunt them with a cure.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.953
She was freaked, she was angry.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.999
And now she's not freaked and angry
and you are.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.627
She says she's feeling better.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.338
Maybe not singing and dancing,
but she's feeling a little bit happy

13:59.464 --> 14:00.756
for the first time in months.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.467
A sudden drop in pain
could create euphoria.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.302
Why don't you let her have her vacation?

14:05.428 --> 14:08.096
Oh, that's great.
And when vacation's over?

14:08.223 --> 14:10.474
When she crash-lands
from all this denial?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.935
She was dealing with her illness.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.436
Now her expectations are rising.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.064
And you're not the one who has to be
there when all that false hope

14:17.190 --> 14:18.565
gets yanked out from under her.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.532
Don't you guys have anything to do?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.411
How long have you been healing people?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.330
You believe that's what I'm doing?

14:34.624 --> 14:35.874
I'd like to.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.043
But you don't.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.672
Why do you always do things
you don't want to do?

14:44.842 --> 14:47.344
It's OK, I don't expect a real answer.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.654
God would probably want you
to take the stick out of your butt

15:05.780 --> 15:07.447
and get over this.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.575
If there is some higher order
running the universe,

15:09.701 --> 15:12.369
it's probably so different from
anything our species can conceive,

15:12.495 --> 15:14.871
there's no point in
even thinking about it.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.499
But I doubt it gives a damn
about my butt.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.794
So you believe God might exist,
but you don't think about it?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.254
It's the most important issue...

15:22.380 --> 15:24.840
I think penguins might as well
speculate about nuclear physics.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.260
- Why are we having this conversation?
- What? I'm curious.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.598
You cannot tell someone they are
your colleague and not a friend,

15:32.724 --> 15:35.017
and then casually chat
about the afterlife.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.331
You actually keep score?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.336
Your MRI results aren't done yet.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.339
Go back to your room. No singing.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.176
Well, you would get a point for
figuring why the low sodium.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.053
What are my guy's points for?

16:11.179 --> 16:14.723
Your trick about the spat
between Dr Cameron and Dr Foreman

16:14.849 --> 16:16.308
apparently impressed someone.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.726
And the second point?

16:21.189 --> 16:24.566
Do you think it could be
because I healed Grace?

16:26.194 --> 16:28.570
She's been back to see me, I like her.

16:28.696 --> 16:32.616
You like messing with people.
That's why you're here now.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.036
Maybe you think that your batteries
are powered by God, maybe you don't.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.497
Either way, you enjoy what you do.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.708
Yes, I like helping people.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.211
I get a rush when I see the look
on their faces when they realize

16:44.337 --> 16:45.754
their burdens are gone.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.422
But you make sure
you're in the next state

16:47.548 --> 16:50.634
by the time the endorphins wear off
and the arthritis comes back.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.428
That doesn't happen.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.223
Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.266
God told me.

16:59.102 --> 17:02.646
You see, that's not fair.
We were having fun.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.898
It's hard to keep sniping rationally

17:05.024 --> 17:06.858
when you throw a bomb
like that in there.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.283
He spoke with me about you, too.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.077
Forgive my enemies?

17:17.203 --> 17:20.163
Never date a Taurus
when Mercury is in retrograde?

17:20.289 --> 17:23.125
Yeah, I learned that one myself,
the hard way.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.086
God says you look for
excuses to be alone.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.923
See, that is exactly the kind of
brilliance that sounds deep,

17:30.049 --> 17:33.385
but you could say it about any person
who doesn't pine for the social approval

17:33.511 --> 17:36.304
of everyone he meets, which you were
cleverly able to deduce about me

17:36.431 --> 17:38.390
by not being a moron.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.559
Next time, tell God to be more specific.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.188
God wants you to invite Dr Wilson
to your poker game.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.581
Don't talk to my patient.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.292
What are you talking about?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.336
You get all huffy when my patient
stumbles into yours in the hallway,

18:08.463 --> 18:10.964
but you got no qualms about
chatting my guy up.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.217
This is fun, it's like Password.
Keep talking.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.762
I'll jump in when I get a clue
what the hell you're talking about.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.306
God knows about my poker game.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.474
You think I told him?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.310
Either that or I start going to church
every Sunday.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.936
That would mess with
my bowling league.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.272
Aside from yelling at him
to get back to his room,

18:27.398 --> 18:29.149
I've never spoken to your patient.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.157
MRI shows an abnormal area.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.827
Tuberous sclerosis.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.371
- It's the right neighborhood.
- Accounts for all the symptoms.

18:43.498 --> 18:48.210
- All of them.
- Leading cortical tuber's identifiable.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.379
- We can do this surgically.
- Tell our patient, "Congratulations."

18:51.506 --> 18:54.841
Soon his chats with God
will be a thing of the past.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.719
Tie goes to the mortal.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.737
Did you know the Catholic Church keeps
a doctor at Lourdes?

19:15.863 --> 19:17.656
He hears the same thing every day.

19:17.782 --> 19:22.536
But, out of the thousands of cases of
people who have claimed to feel better,

19:22.662 --> 19:27.249
the Catholic Church has only recognized
a handful as miracles.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.459
But they do recognize a handful.

19:29.585 --> 19:34.172
Well, they're a church.
It's what they do.

19:35.591 --> 19:39.761
Look. For the past couple of years,

19:39.887 --> 19:42.430
the world's been getting smaller.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.516
Eight months, six months...

19:46.686 --> 19:49.688
I watch a trailer for a movie
and I think,

19:49.814 --> 19:52.649
"Am I gonna be here
when that comes out?"

19:54.694 --> 19:58.154
But maybe there is still
a horizon out there.

19:58.281 --> 20:03.326
You know, maybe... Maybe I can make
plans for a year from now.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.619
Two years.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.249
I like the view.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.295
The view is a lie,
and if you believe it,

20:13.421 --> 20:15.672
you're going to crash so hard.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.302
Let me take new images of your liver.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.721
You can't accept that it could be true.

20:22.847 --> 20:26.016
Well, if it is true,
you shouldn't be afraid of proving it.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.815
Tuberous sclerosis is
a genetic disorder.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.319
It causes small, benign tumors
to grow in various parts of the body.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.280
- In this case, the brain.
- You said benign.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.451
They probably are, but benign or not,
they're not in a good location.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.412
- We need to remove them.
- You're talking brain surgery?

20:47.538 --> 20:50.457
His symptoms are getting worse,
which means the tumors are growing.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.252
Surgery will correct it all,
the chemical imbalance, the seizures,

20:54.378 --> 20:55.587
the auditory hallucinations.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.881
Hallucinations?

20:58.007 --> 21:01.343
Without the surgery,
it's just gonna get worse.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.094
Might even be fatal.

21:03.220 --> 21:07.724
With the surgery, your son should be
a perfectly normal 15-year-old boy.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.061
I'm not normal.

21:19.862 --> 21:23.239
I need you to talk to my patient.
I'll get this one.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.452
Why do I have the feeling
you're plotting world domination?

21:27.578 --> 21:30.872
Moses is refusing surgery.
You have a gift.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.667
People thank you for telling them
they're going to die.

21:34.961 --> 21:39.214
If I can get him to agree to surgery,
I want in on the poker game.

21:39.340 --> 21:42.968
You would let this kid die
just to get into a stupid game?

21:43.094 --> 21:44.719
You'd let him die just to keep me out?

21:51.769 --> 21:52.769
Hi.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.731
I'm Dr Wilson.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.818
I knew they'd send somebody else.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.696
- That God has a big mouth.
- House.

22:04.699 --> 22:08.702
Can I ask why you don't want
the tumors removed?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.412
God put them there for a reason.

22:10.538 --> 22:13.790
You think God needs a telephone
in your head to talk to you?

22:13.916 --> 22:16.251
Isn't he everywhere?
It's not a long-distance call, is it?

22:16.377 --> 22:18.670
This is the way God does things,
through natural law.

22:18.796 --> 22:22.382
If he went around doing big
flashy miracles all the time,

22:22.508 --> 22:24.926
- nobody would need faith.
- How come everyone else needs faith,

22:25.052 --> 22:28.263
but you just get the guy
screaming his existence in your ear?

22:31.058 --> 22:32.475
Your turn.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.815
Do you think God wants you to die?

22:38.941 --> 22:42.569
This is the way that the Lord often is
with his chosen ones.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.822
He gives the most trials
to those that he loves the most.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.657
How sweet.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.869
You abdicate your authority,
avoid those tricky parental issues,

22:50.995 --> 22:54.289
like whether to let him drive at 16.
Just let him die at 15.

22:54.415 --> 22:59.002
So, you believe your son is...

22:59.128 --> 23:02.130
...erm, a saint?

23:03.132 --> 23:07.802
The way I understand it, one of
the hallmarks of a saint is humility.

23:07.928 --> 23:11.723
Now, someone with true humility
would consider the possibility

23:11.849 --> 23:15.393
that God hadn't chosen him for
that kind of honor.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.604
Well, he'd consider the possibility

23:17.730 --> 23:21.733
that he just had an illness.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.284
You have a gift for manipulation.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.578
I listen, I have an actual conversation
with people,

23:33.704 --> 23:36.498
which, shockingly, does raise
the odds they'll be cooperative.

23:36.624 --> 23:37.707
That's what I'm saying.

23:37.833 --> 23:41.503
You read that kid and you manipulated
the hell out of him.

23:43.798 --> 23:45.465
Bring pretzels.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.853
I know that knock.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.440
Use your key, I'm not getting up.

24:15.204 --> 24:18.790
Game's not till tomorrow night
and those aren't pretzels.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.627
I took some images of
Grace Palmieri's cancer.

24:25.506 --> 24:26.631
Yeah?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.265
Her tumor's shrunk.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.951
Don't tell my patient.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.416
I want all the records on miracle woman.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.210
Every test,
every treatment she's ever had,

25:04.336 --> 25:06.838
every question she's ever answered
in this hospital.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.425
And anything sent from previous doctors.
Go back to neonatal if you have to.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.432
Which part of "keep them away from
each other" confused you?

25:17.558 --> 25:21.060
They're friends.
She thinks he saved her life.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.647
Now we have obligingly offered
medical proof

25:24.773 --> 25:26.441
that his delusions are true.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.943
They've withdrawn permission
for the surgery.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.071
I put the lawyers on it.
Her tumor shrank?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.406
I'm on it.

25:35.784 --> 25:39.704
Tell Jesus that we need another 24 hours
to normalize his sodium level.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.706
He's already normalized.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.792
Actually, tell Joseph.
Jesus will know you're lying.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.377
And I want you and Foreman and
Cameron

25:46.503 --> 25:49.088
to go over every line of every file
on that woman.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.924
Isn't he the one we're supposed to save?

25:52.009 --> 25:56.012
The only way to save him
is to prove that she is still dying.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.356
MRI machine checks out.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.983
Maybe the radiologist mis-charted
which machine they used.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.443
I checked both.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.947
This is insane,
we're diagnosing a recovery.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.073
What about six months ago?

26:15.199 --> 26:17.367
Maybe there was a malfunction in
her "before" pictures,

26:17.493 --> 26:20.620
some shadow that made the tumor
look bigger than it really was.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.039
I'll go see what I can find out.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.500
Maybe it's a delayed effect
from radiation.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.043
Sometimes it could take a while.

26:27.169 --> 26:28.878
She hasn't had radiation
for six months.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.380
- Here.
- Nowhere. Her records...

26:30.506 --> 26:33.299
There's about a dozen appliances
in every home that give off radiation.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.844
Dosages that wouldn't hurt a hamster if
it was tied to the machine for a year.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.555
If the machine's operating properly.

26:39.682 --> 26:41.432
Sometimes remissions just happen.

26:43.143 --> 26:46.020
You think House will just shrug
and say that

26:46.146 --> 26:48.147
if one of us doesn't check the home?

27:15.926 --> 27:17.760
- Kings on nines.
- Out.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.096
Thank you.

27:22.474 --> 27:28.646
Wilson. This is a dry cleaner,
tax accountant, guy from the bus stop.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.023
This is Wilson.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.691
How come he gets a name?

27:32.943 --> 27:34.944
Seniority. Hello.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.003
Find anything?

27:52.129 --> 27:55.631
Do you have any idea how many
electrical devices give off radiation?

27:55.758 --> 27:58.051
- All of them.
- I'm going to be here all night.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.719
Everybody's a whiner.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.180
Be a doer, not a me-tooer.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.390
Raise.

28:05.309 --> 28:06.351
I'm out.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.687
She's got at least four different types
of pain pills here

28:09.813 --> 28:11.731
and an LED device.

28:15.486 --> 28:17.028
I'll raise your raise.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.325
Keep looking.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.376
Fold.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.589
You were bluffing,
he knew you were bluffing.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.383
Your luck's changing tonight.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.720
So, did they find anything?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.389
Or are you gonna have to
accept the fact

28:44.515 --> 28:46.974
that every now and then
remissions happen?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.539
This call had better be worth my time.

29:09.665 --> 29:13.251
This is what happens when it's not
our patient. We don't know enough.

29:13.377 --> 29:17.088
- That's why you're there.
- She's got a boyfriend...

29:18.090 --> 29:21.551
- Unless you think he's radioactive...
...who could show up any minute.

29:21.677 --> 29:25.179
The honor of working for you
is not worth a felony charge.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.264
Give me a minute.

29:34.773 --> 29:38.609
I'm saying the odds of you
having a straight flush are pretty low.

29:43.699 --> 29:44.615
House?

29:55.961 --> 29:57.378
I'll fold.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.006
- Fold.
- Fold.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.884
I'm screwed, aren't I?

30:15.981 --> 30:18.774
Nine bucks for a straight flush.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.743
He's not coming home. Relax.

30:32.289 --> 30:36.959
There's nothing in this universe
that can't be explained, eventually.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.046
Take this game.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.925
Only two people knew that
you wanted in on it.

30:44.051 --> 30:45.468
I didn't tell him...

30:45.594 --> 30:48.513
- I told you, I didn't tell him.
- Why would you?

30:48.639 --> 30:51.599
No, the only person he's been getting
all intimate and conversational with

30:51.725 --> 30:53.142
is your cancer chick.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.936
How would she know?

30:55.062 --> 30:56.646
The subject of my poker game

30:56.772 --> 30:59.232
isn't likely to come up in
the course of a patient interview.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.109
Well, that's the kind of thing that
you mention

31:02.236 --> 31:04.987
to someone you're used to
sharing the details of your day with.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.199
Don't.

31:08.951 --> 31:12.286
Your rabbi.
Guidance counselor, parent.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.539
She's not your mom, is she?

31:14.665 --> 31:16.874
I'm seriously saying don't.

31:18.043 --> 31:20.962
- You've been having sex...
- This is so not the place.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.047
...with our miracle woman.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.557
Excuse me.
May I talk to you?

31:32.683 --> 31:34.100
Of course.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.727
Boyd's getting dressed,
he's ready to check out.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.647
He can't check out
without your permission.

31:39.773 --> 31:42.441
- His sodium level still isn't normal.
- I told him.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.695
He said that God said it was OK,
he was fine.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.073
Could you talk to him?

31:50.951 --> 31:52.285
Tell them my name isn't Wilson.

31:53.787 --> 31:58.124
Most people in your situation
just have their careers to worry about.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.126
You've got that and divine retribution.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.460
Tell them.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.130
Tell me how it happened,
and I'll tell them whatever you want.

32:06.508 --> 32:09.051
She'd had a bad day, pain-wise.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.805
Her ride didn't show up
to take her home.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.142
- So, you offered?
- Yeah.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.312
She didn't have any groceries,
she was too sick to go out,

32:19.438 --> 32:24.984
I figured I could afford
to take a half hour

32:25.110 --> 32:26.319
and pick her up a few things...

32:26.445 --> 32:29.030
- Stay and make sure she's OK.
- Yeah.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.616
And never leave.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.869
You told me you got an apartment.

32:35.412 --> 32:38.164
But you moved in with her.
You lied to me.

32:39.249 --> 32:40.249
Tell them.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.838
His name is not Wilson
and he's screwed up worse than I am.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.007
OK. Yes, I lied to you.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.133
I'm sorry.

32:49.259 --> 32:52.511
Half the doctors who specialize in
oncology turn into burned-out cases.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.598
But you, you eat neediness.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.350
Lucky for you.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.562
Thanks for the game, guys.
I don't think I'll be coming back.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.314
You're a functional vampire.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.108
Sure, you're heroic, useful to society,

33:06.234 --> 33:07.985
but only because it feeds you.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.240
There's nothing worth stealing,
so don't even look.

33:19.373 --> 33:23.167
You don't just have a fetish
for needy people, you marry them!

33:23.960 --> 33:25.044
- Here we go.
- You mean it!

33:25.170 --> 33:29.173
And then time passes, and suddenly
they're not so needy any more.

33:29.299 --> 33:32.134
Your fault.
You've been there for them too much.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.805
They're getting healthy,
independent and that's just ugly.

33:35.931 --> 33:39.517
God, you must be pissed at God
right now, making her all happy.

33:39.643 --> 33:41.727
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're being stupid.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.690
You know what you're risking
by sleeping with a patient.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.274
Oh, that's crap.

33:47.401 --> 33:49.902
You're not mad
because I'm risking my job.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.404
You're not even mad
cos I lied to you.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.823
You're mad because I lied to you
and you couldn't tell.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.325
- Yeah. You got me nailed.
- Yeah.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.869
That's why you didn't want me
in your poker game.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.788
Because when it comes to
being in control,

34:00.914 --> 34:03.582
Gregory House leaves
our faith-healer kid in the dust

34:03.709 --> 34:06.335
and that's why
religious belief annoys you.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.462
Because if the universe operates
by abstract rules,

34:08.588 --> 34:10.798
you can learn them
and you can protect yourself.

34:10.924 --> 34:14.677
If a supreme being exists,
he can squash you any time he wants.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.429
He knows where I am.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.433
I think it's yours.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.643
Yeah.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.981
I'll be right there.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.986
Jesus is spiking a fever.
He's delusional.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.821
Tuberous sclerosis
doesn't cause fever.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.740
I know.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.324
I'll drive.

34:43.457 --> 34:48.043
Pick any random guy off the street,
bring him in here,

34:48.170 --> 34:52.173
examine him exhaustively, you will find
at least three things wrong with him.

34:52.299 --> 34:55.426
This kid has tuberous sclerosis,
a mild case.

34:55.552 --> 34:56.844
But his tumors are growing.

34:56.970 --> 35:00.055
We assumed that the tumors were growing,
cos he's getting sicker.

35:00.182 --> 35:02.641
But he could have grown old and died
and never known about them

35:02.768 --> 35:03.851
if he hadn't come here.

35:03.977 --> 35:07.146
We were looking for something, it's more
or less in the right part of the brain.

35:07.272 --> 35:10.775
It's like we found someone
standing over a dead body holding a gun,

35:10.901 --> 35:12.526
we arrested them,
didn't look any further.

35:12.652 --> 35:16.989
Sometimes people really do
just stumble into a murder scene.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.366
His fever's 103 and rising.

35:19.493 --> 35:21.577
If we don't do anything, he's gonna be
chatting with God

35:21.703 --> 35:22.953
face-to-face real soon.

35:23.079 --> 35:26.081
Fevers don't come from
a long-term underlying condition.

35:26.208 --> 35:31.212
He's a garden-variety religious nut
who happens to have an infection.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.339
It's lumbar puncture time.

35:35.801 --> 35:39.970
No, no, God told me,
no more of man's medicine.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.722
If we have faith in him,
he'll make me well.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.767
It's just a test.
We just want to find out what's wrong.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.561
God knows what's wrong,
God will take care of it.

35:47.687 --> 35:52.149
He's delirious and he's a minor.
This is your decision and not his.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.610
"The Kingdom of Heaven is like
a treasure hidden in a field,

35:54.736 --> 35:57.947
which when a man finds, he hides,
and for joy he goes and sells

35:58.073 --> 35:59.782
all he owns and buys that field."

35:59.908 --> 36:02.409
Buy all the land you want,
don't blow your brains out.

36:02.536 --> 36:05.371
You're watching your son kill himself.
He's out of his mind with fever...

36:05.497 --> 36:09.959
Dad! If your faith is weak, I will fail.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.586
I need you.

36:18.218 --> 36:22.638
I'm sorry, you don't even know
what's wrong with him.

36:24.558 --> 36:26.517
God knows the answer

36:26.643 --> 36:29.478
and I would rather leave it
in his hands than yours.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.072
Wilson.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.782
I need you to do your thing.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.870
You do know that I don't actually
have magical powers.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.371
I have faith.

36:47.497 --> 36:50.040
You're better off trying to slip
some antibiotics into a meal.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.835
Which antibiotics?
We don't know what infection he's got.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.420
- Go as broad as you can.
- Forget it.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.922
Our best hope is your silver tongue.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.716
What if it's not an infection?

36:58.842 --> 37:01.802
Were you not paying attention when
I was doing my murder scene metaphor?

37:01.928 --> 37:03.679
What if the tuberous sclerosis
is guilty.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.848
It had the gun in its hands,
it was standing over the...

37:05.974 --> 37:07.099
Doesn't cause fever.

37:07.225 --> 37:10.561
It causes everything else. What if
the fever's the innocent bystander?

37:10.687 --> 37:13.480
The fever could have been set off
by something he picked up anywhere.

37:13.607 --> 37:14.940
It could have been a bug he got here.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.072
Or a bug he gave here.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.870
He gave it to your patient.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.749
That's why her tumor shrank,
the virus went after the cancer first.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.710
Are you saying
a virus attacked her tumor?

37:34.836 --> 37:39.757
For 200 years, there've been reports of
wild viruses that target tumors.

37:39.883 --> 37:43.469
Early 1900s, an Italian medical journal
wrote up a woman with cervical cancer

37:43.595 --> 37:45.596
who was injected with
a weak strain of rabies.

37:45.722 --> 37:48.140
I have no idea why they did that,
but her tumor shrank.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.725
You think he gave her rabies?

37:49.851 --> 37:54.355
One of the virus types most prone
to go after cancer cells is herpes.

37:54.481 --> 37:55.981
Herpes encephalitis.

37:57.651 --> 37:58.984
It would fit.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.655
Seizure, low sodium,
even the blurred vision.

38:02.781 --> 38:06.700
And it would mean, if you're right,
Grace's cancer is coming back.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.996
You're not gonna be able
to convince them.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.248
They don't want any more tests,
they don't wanna...

38:13.375 --> 38:15.292
They can't argue with the mark of Cain.

38:17.295 --> 38:21.507
I'm not going to change my mind.
No more tests. God knows the way.

38:21.675 --> 38:23.926
OK, let's start with the shirt.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.971
What are you doing? What are you
doing?

38:27.097 --> 38:28.806
I'm on a mission from God.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.475
If you won't let me undress you,
then strip.

38:31.601 --> 38:32.977
What's he doing? What's going on?

38:33.103 --> 38:35.646
That woman you helped?
You gave her a virus.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.606
No, she's healed, I have a gift.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.693
A gift is jewelry, socks.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.736
What you have is herpes encephalitis.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.364
And the only way
you could've transmitted it

38:45.490 --> 38:48.117
is by scratching one of your own sores
and touching another person.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.327
That's something you get from sex,
right?

38:50.453 --> 38:53.747
Either that or cold sores.
Your kid got it from the sex.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.667
No, no. No sores. No, my body's clean.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.043
They examined me when I came in!

38:58.169 --> 38:59.545
- No sores.
- Herpes hides.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.007
You have an outbreak, it goes away,
it comes back, goes away. Strip!

39:03.133 --> 39:05.759
Maybe you didn't have a sore when
you came in, but you've got one now.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.970
Dad, I've never, ever...

39:08.096 --> 39:12.224
Do you wonder why a perfect child of God
should feel so desperate

39:12.350 --> 39:14.351
to "purify his body" that he needed
to scarf down

39:14.477 --> 39:16.270
a dozen gallons of water a day?

39:16.396 --> 39:18.272
Boyd, is he right?

39:18.398 --> 39:22.818
Dad! No, he's crazy! Help me!
Dr Wilson, help!

39:22.944 --> 39:25.612
God said no medicine, no procedures.

39:25.739 --> 39:28.323
Taking off your clothes doesn't count
as either of those.

39:28.450 --> 39:29.825
This one's your call.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.247
Son...

39:36.708 --> 39:39.752
- Dad, you have to have faith in me.
- I have faith in the Lord.

39:39.878 --> 39:44.923
You, I trust,
as much as you can trust a teenage boy.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.761
Take off your clothes.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.191
Relax.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.818
A few Hail Marys, a little acyclovir,

40:04.944 --> 40:07.196
you'll be picking up angels again
in no time.

40:25.799 --> 40:27.091
Come in.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.601
My father told me
I have to apologize to you.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.063
You still hearing the voices?

40:44.234 --> 40:45.818
You're lucky.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.613
You go through life with a certainty
that what you're doing is right.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.992
I know how comforting that is.

40:59.624 --> 41:00.833
Good luck.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.976
You're not gonna give me my final point?

41:20.103 --> 41:21.562
You knew it was me?

41:22.188 --> 41:23.480
Who else?

41:34.868 --> 41:37.369
You don't think God should get
a point knocked off?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.913
- The tumor shrank.
- Because of a virus.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.165
Do you know what the odds are?

41:41.291 --> 41:42.875
She had to have
the right type of cancer,

41:43.001 --> 41:45.043
he had to have the right type of virus.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.963
- The exposure...
- She won the lottery.

41:48.089 --> 41:51.091
You say "won the lottery",
he says "miracle".

41:51.217 --> 41:54.928
Yeah, the hand of God reached into
this kid's pants, made him have sex

41:55.054 --> 41:58.348
so he could scratch a rash and stick
his fingers in some woman's face,

41:58.474 --> 42:00.058
give her a few extra months.

42:00.185 --> 42:03.478
Come on, he's just another liar
and manipulator.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.939
Well, nobody's as perfect as you are.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.904
It is possible to believe in something
and still fail to live up to it.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.088
So, how's your girlfriend?

42:31.007 --> 42:34.092
She got a little extra time out of this.
Not a lot.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.178
She didn't crash.

42:36.304 --> 42:39.097
No. She says she's happier when
she believes in something

42:39.224 --> 42:40.933
bigger than she is.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.018
She still believes.

42:43.144 --> 42:45.479
Faith. She's going to Florence.

42:46.356 --> 42:48.398
You moving out?

42:48.524 --> 42:49.900
Yeah.

42:50.026 --> 42:51.568
Moving back in with me?

42:53.988 --> 42:56.240
I don't think that's a great idea.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.285
But we're OK?

43:01.996 --> 43:03.497
House, you are...

43:07.418 --> 43:08.877
...as God made you.
