00:56.960 --> 00:59.030
The housekeeper used to be called
Mrs Hughes.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.109
I don't know if she's still here.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.519
Leave everything to me, m'lord.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.635
I'll see you upstairs.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.278
I won't be up before the gong.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.115
Can I help?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.758
Stick it under my arm if you can.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.875
You're an angel from above.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.949
I don't know about that.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.234
Do you know where
Lord Gillingham's room is?

01:19.320 --> 01:21.197
There's a maid on the gallery with a list.
She'll show you.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.918
See?
You've got the answer to everything.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.956
And I suspect you have, too,
Mr Gillingham.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.234
Was the train on time, Sir John?

01:32.320 --> 01:34.390
Absolutely.
It was all as efficient as you like.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.673
Mrs Jefferson?

01:37.960 --> 01:39.598
How nice to see you.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.353
Which one's Mr Sampson?
And why have we asked him?

01:42.480 --> 01:46.632
Ah, well, I see him at White's every now
and then and he seemed keen to come.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.314
- He's over there, talking to Mama.
- Ah, yes.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.515
Who's the glamorous pirate?

01:52.040 --> 01:54.600
Don't you recognise
Johnnie Gillingham's son?

01:54.680 --> 01:57.240
- Anthony Foyle?
- Yes, but he's Lord Gillingham now.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.993
Ah. I haven't seen him
since his father's funeral.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.715
I know, but I wrote afterwards
and he answered.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.233
Well.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.273
- How nice of you to come.
- It's good to be back at Downton.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.397
Mary, you remember Anthony Foyle?
Sorry, Gillingham.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.311
I remember a very superior young man

02:13.400 --> 02:16.437
who found three little girls
extremely tiresome to deal with.

02:16.520 --> 02:19.592
I seem to be rather outnumbered
by your parents' old friends.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.193
Oh, don't worry.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.396
You and Papa are really going
to get to know each other this time.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.038
I promise.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.078
You're the agent here now, aren't you?
Mary told me.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.717
You must miss darling Sybil so dreadfully.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.756
Yes.
Did you have a good journey?

02:33.960 --> 02:37.032
I'm afraid Tom's small talk
is very small indeed.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.872
Not everyone can be Oscar Wilde.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.758
- That's a relief.
- Go up when you like.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.275
We'll gather in the drawing room at eight.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.231
Ten staying and only three maids
and two valets between them.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.311
Not quite like before the war, is it?

02:53.400 --> 02:54.753
Very little is.

02:54.920 --> 02:55.989
Hmm.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.993
Well, they're mostly easy
and the Duchess of Yeovil's no trouble at all.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.953
Of course, we don't know Mr Sampson
or Sir John Bullock

03:03.040 --> 03:05.395
and we haven't seen
Lord Gillingham for a while.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.831
Oh, Anna, can you look in on Mrs Jefferson?

03:09.280 --> 03:10.508
They're in the Chinese.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.159
Of course.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.798
Oh, Edna, Lady Raven

03:13.880 --> 03:15.472
might need a helping hand.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.437
She's in Fontenoy.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.909
She says she's used to having no maid,
but I rather doubt it.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.718
I'm not sure I've got time.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.119
Make time.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.919
Poor Lady Raven.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.753
When you think of her life
ten years ago and now.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.753
I'm told she has some dingy little house
north of the park.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.796
It's a wonder they still ask her to stay.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.711
Well, perhaps her ladyship does not wish
to cast away an old friend

03:38.800 --> 03:40.472
because she lives north of the park.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.877
I know, I know. But still, it's sad.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.872
We never moved back after the war.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.951
It was a hospital, you know.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.519
And now?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.909
- It's a girls' school.
- Hmm.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.560
But we're quite comfortable
in the Dower House.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.119
Did you ever see it?

03:59.240 --> 04:01.708
I remember having tea there once
with your grandmother.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.268
She gave me ice cream
and I got it all over my dress.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.074
Nanny was furious.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.878
That sounds like Grandmama.

04:07.960 --> 04:11.111
She'd always say how
children should be spoiled.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.877
She's gone now, so she'll never know
if I took her advice.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.315
- You have no children?
- No.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.630
No children, no wife.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.676
I've come close a couple of times.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.716
- In fact, I'm close now.
- Hmm.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.835
What about you?

04:25.680 --> 04:27.716
I have a son, George.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.599
You know that Matthew...

04:31.320 --> 04:33.356
Oh, God, I'm, I'm sorry.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.356
Of course I know. I just wasn't thinking.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.309
Please forgive me.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.399
There's nothing to forgive.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.476
I go this way and you're down there.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.314
Oh, not those bowls, Ivy!

04:53.400 --> 04:57.234
Chilled soup should be
an exquisite mouthful, not a bucket of slop!

04:57.320 --> 04:58.594
I'll get the smaller ones.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.795
Daisy, how are the squabs doing?

04:59.920 --> 05:00.909
Fine, Mrs Patmore.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.155
What about the syllabubs?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.391
The orange peel and brandy mix
is cooling in the larder.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.072
I'll whip the cream during the first course.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.479
What about the savoury?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.749
Mushrooms peeled and cut,

05:09.840 --> 05:10.955
anchovy butter's ready,

05:11.040 --> 05:13.315
I'll make the toast when they eat the pudding.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.150
Oh, my God, the vegetables.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.632
She'll bust a gut if she keeps that up.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.551
Have you settled him in satisfactorily,
Mr Gillingham?

05:22.640 --> 05:25.074
I wish you would call me Green.
That's my real name.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.752
Mr Carson wouldn't approve.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.070
- He believes in the old ways.
- And what do you believe in?

05:29.880 --> 05:31.393
I believe in getting on with my work.

05:31.480 --> 05:35.189
All work and no play makes Jack
a dull boy and Jill a dull girl.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.918
Perhaps I should organise some games.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.350
I'll "organise" you, if you don't watch out.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.798
They finally got you into white tie, I see.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.679
More's the pity.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.398
I've never felt more stupid in my life.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.314
I was wondering

05:53.640 --> 05:56.154
why we've never spoken since I came back.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.151
I hope we can still be friends?

06:01.080 --> 06:02.672
Of course. Of course we can.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.833
But we can't have lunch again
at the pub in the village?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.594
Braithwaite, Edna,

06:14.080 --> 06:15.593
I'm trying to walk a tightrope here...

06:15.680 --> 06:17.398
As long as you're not my enemy.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.719
God, no.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.711
I hope things turn out well for you.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.472
I do, truly.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.356
I gather the Abbey is once more
to be a scene of great splendour.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.556
Are you going up there for any of it?

06:38.640 --> 06:41.200
I'm supposed to go for dinner
on the last night.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.631
- To hear Melba sing.
- Oh.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.676
I envy you.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.159
But you don't sound very glad.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.514
I don't want them to spend their days
in Stygian gloom.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.113
I really don't.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.474
They say "life must go on"
and of course it must.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.511
But it seems disloyal to Matthew.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.157
Not disloyal, exactly.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.509
- What does Lady Mary feel?
- Oh, you know Mary.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.678
She's always quite opaque.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.519
I love Al Jolson, don't you?

07:11.600 --> 07:13.158
I've got all his records.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.719
Including "April Showers"?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.712
Of course. I love it madly.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.749
- Are you ever in London?
- I might be.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.269
We're a little exposed up here

07:24.360 --> 07:25.952
to sow barley as a winter crop.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.790
The Duke always swore by it.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.631
Did you know that barley beer
was probably the first alcoholic drink?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.633
It was developed by Neolithic man.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.633
So we all owe him quite a debt.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.234
Do we? Oh, there's poor Lady Raven.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.830
I really ought to go and talk to her.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.638
Of course, your grace.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.633
What a treat to find you here...

07:48.760 --> 07:50.318
Don't call her "yourgrace".

07:50.760 --> 07:51.909
I thought it was correct.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.468
For a servant, or an official at a ceremony,

07:54.560 --> 07:58.838
but in a social situation call her Duchess.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.071
But why? I don't call you Countess.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.509
Certainly not.

08:02.880 --> 08:03.869
There's no logic in it.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.753
Oh, no. If I were to search for logic,

08:06.840 --> 08:10.150
I should not look for it among
the English upper class.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.238
Thomas, get me a drink will you,
for God's sake.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.151
It's Barrow now, sir. But yes, of course.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.915
- What about a hand at cards?
- Why not?

08:22.640 --> 08:26.110
I'll get them to set up a table for you
in the smoking room. Barrow?

08:26.560 --> 08:27.788
Er, already done, m'lord.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.592
Will you play, Lord Grantham?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.159
I don't think so.
Not tonight.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.229
Do you ever play?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.432
Well, I used to.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.114
- But tonight I'd rather be with you.
- It's no trouble.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.392
We have plenty of horses
and Papa would be delighted.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.909
- Have you anything to ride in?
- We packed it all, just in case.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.195
Well, that settles it.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.390
I'll send a message to the stables tonight.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.275
Will you come out with me?

08:51.480 --> 08:52.674
Actually, I might.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.593
I haven't been in the saddle forages.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.036
I'll be as stiff as a board the next day.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.032
Would anyone else
like to go riding tomorrow morning?

09:03.120 --> 09:04.394
- Sir John?
- No.

09:04.640 --> 09:05.629
Mr Sampson?

09:06.120 --> 09:07.792
Must I?

09:08.040 --> 09:09.075
Edith?

09:09.960 --> 09:12.155
- Do you ride?
- Not if I don't have to.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.758
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.399
Why on earth are you doing that
at this ungodly hour?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.830
- Where are the girls?
- I sent them to bed.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.433
Then I thought I might get ahead of myself.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.440
Come to think of it, I might lay out
what I need for the breakfast.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.509
All set for tomorrow?

09:31.680 --> 09:33.318
I think so.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.789
But where should we feed
Dame Nellie on Sunday?

09:35.920 --> 09:39.071
She can't eat in the servant's hall.
And what about the pianist?

09:39.240 --> 09:42.869
Well, he can join us
and she can have a tray in her room.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.710
You don't think she should
dine with the house party?

09:47.040 --> 09:48.553
An Australian singer?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.392
Eating with her ladyship?

09:50.480 --> 09:51.708
Never mind the Duchess!

09:51.800 --> 09:53.358
No, I do not!

10:05.200 --> 10:06.189
Mr Molesley?

10:06.360 --> 10:07.475
Hello.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.438
- What are you doing?
- Mrs Patmore left an order with Mr Bakewell.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.999
She said it was urgent.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.798
Oh, what's this, Mr Molesley?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.598
Are you delivering for Bakewell's now?

10:16.960 --> 10:17.995
I'm just filling in.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.559
Until something turns up.

10:19.640 --> 10:20.834
You're a delivery boy?

10:21.160 --> 10:24.436
Now, now, Daisy.
There's no shame in hard work.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.593
You sit there, Mr Molesley,
and I'll fetch you some tea.

10:27.680 --> 10:28.954
Thank you.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.549
You played late.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.517
I hope you didn't think me rude
forgoing to bed.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.035
No, not a bit.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.793
How was the game?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.316
Sampson is a very skilled player.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.909
Oh.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.673
Where were you last night?

10:53.000 --> 10:53.989
Being thrashed by Sampson.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.911
Poor you.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.549
I hope that means I can count on you tonight.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.557
You can always count on me.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.236
What are your plans for today?

11:03.400 --> 11:05.391
I thought I'd go to the South Wood,
look at the new planting.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.718
Won't you help me entertain our guests?

11:08.520 --> 11:09.635
Just give me two hours off

11:09.720 --> 11:11.358
and I'll do what ever you want.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.591
We're going for a walk after breakfast.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.035
Why don't you come?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.116
I don't think so.
I've got too much to do.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.033
Rounding this lot up.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.514
Coffee?

11:22.840 --> 11:23.989
Not yet, thank you.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.836
I'm going to manage it somehow.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.117
I've a feeling he's very good at putting off
what he doesn't want to do.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.475
He's not as calculated as that.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.437
How little we know our own parents.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.910
Apparently he took a fortune
off Sir John Bullock.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.149
What about your employer?

11:42.240 --> 11:43.753
Ah, his lordship's too clever for that.

11:43.840 --> 11:44.955
He got out the game early.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.029
That's not what I heard.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.397
- What were they playing?
- Poker.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.468
Of course it was poker.
You can't lose a fortune playing snap.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.393
I could.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.958
Mabel Lane Fox?

11:56.400 --> 11:59.392
So, you've caught the greatest heiress
of the Season.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.277
She's very nice, in fact.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.634
I'm sure.

12:02.720 --> 12:07.271
Of course, everyone wants it,
on both sides, but we do get on.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.152
You may be surprised to hear
that a match which is wanted by everyone

12:11.240 --> 12:13.800
can turn out to be extremely happy.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.871
Do you speak from experience?

12:15.960 --> 12:17.598
Absolutely.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.832
Matthew and I were flung at each other's
heads from the moment he arrived.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.798
If anything, it rather slowed matters up.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.110
But you were happy?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.872
Wonderfully happy.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.432
How lucky you are.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.593
Am I?

12:33.680 --> 12:35.830
You've known a great love.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.309
Doesn't that enrich any life?

12:38.960 --> 12:40.393
I'm not sure.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.038
Matthew changed me.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.791
I loved him, but he changed me.

12:47.440 --> 12:51.797
If I were as tough as I was before I met him,
I bet I'd be happier now.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.069
Maybe.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.070
But we can't go back, can we?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.673
Apparently not.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.669
What will you do with that?

13:05.760 --> 13:08.877
Cover it and dry it on the stove,
then put it into muslin bags.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.315
Old Lady Gillingham's maid
just buys it in packets.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.753
Perhaps she's not a country girl.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.354
Well, judging by you,
she's the poorer for that.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.398
You've plenty of time for chatter.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.515
You can blame me.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.953
I'm afraid it's a failing of mine.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.195
I do blame you.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.279
What is the matter?

13:28.360 --> 13:29.839
I don't know.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.514
There's something about him
that gets my goat.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.511
He was just trying to be nice.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.149
Carson.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.310
We're all going on a tour
of the gardens in ten minutes.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.436
When we get back, it might be nice
to have some coffee.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.752
Very well, m'lady.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.556
- Is everything under control?
- It is.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.677
It's exciting to think
of Nellie Melba singing at Downton.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.114
Ah! I'm not sure about exciting.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.679
It's certainly very expensive.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.797
I know, but a house party can be so flat
if there's no special moment.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.356
And it wouldn't be special enough
to watch the sun set by the lake?

14:01.600 --> 14:03.318
- Good morning ladies.
- Good morning.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.389
- What is it?
- I can't get the lid off this.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.913
Give it here.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.033
I'll do it.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.509
Stand back.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.232
Let a real man handle it.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.828
Come on.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.797
I wonder what happened to that "real man".

14:33.280 --> 14:34.599
See?

14:34.680 --> 14:36.477
Told you I was master here.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.749
That'll teach you to show off.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.348
I hurt myself, thank you very much.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.954
Well, you'll mend,
which is more than I can say for that jar.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.635
Daisy, Ivy,

14:47.720 --> 14:50.188
clear this mess up.
As I assume Mr Clever Clogs won't.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.992
I'm getting quite fluent.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.870
You're taking German lessons?

15:04.960 --> 15:06.473
Well, if I'm going to live there.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.676
No, no. Of course.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.190
I just can't get over the fact
you're doing all this to be with me.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.592
Whatever it takes.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.590
Michael was admiring the library.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.352
It's marvellous.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.317
Edith tells me there's a Gutenberg Bible.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.915
Yes. It's a shame our librarian,
Mr Pattinson, isn't here.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.994
He's the only one
who knows where anything is.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.874
Well, if you'll excuse me,

15:33.960 --> 15:36.155
I must go and sort out the wine for tonight.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.193
He doesn't approve of me.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.756
- He doesn't know you.
- Nor is he likely to.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.996
Serve the Margaux at dinner,
and keep the Haut-Brion for tomorrow.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.158
No, the '99, if we have enough.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.958
I want to go out with a bang.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.359
And you can choose the white.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.634
Very good, m'lord.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.917
One thing. Her ladyship
has been kind enough to invite

16:00.000 --> 16:02.150
the servants to hear
Dame Nellie tomorrow evening.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.673
It's a rare opportunity for them.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.113
She's very generous.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.431
Er, but I wondered, what are we to do
about the kitchen staff?

16:08.520 --> 16:10.715
Why? Do you fear
the corrupting influence of opera?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.313
Oh, not at all, m'lord.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.199
But before the war they wouldn't usually
have been included.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.436
Oh, I think we must bend that far, Carson.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.999
Modern times and all that.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.957
As you wish, m'lord.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.112
I've arranged for Dame Nellie's accompanist
to sleep with the male servants...

16:24.200 --> 16:26.794
Well, I doubt he'd expect to sleep
with the female ones.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.914
And Dame Nellie will have dinner in her room.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.319
Very good.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.668
Whatever you think.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.989
How wonderful to see an estate
that's still all in one piece.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.230
Don't speak too soon.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.276
What do you mean?

16:54.360 --> 16:56.954
Well, we have a big tax bill to pay.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.919
Papa wants to sell land,
but I'd like to see if we can avoid it.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.036
The trouble is, I can't get him to listen.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.791
Shall I tell you what I'd do?

17:06.160 --> 17:07.309
Please.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.233
Make him agree for you
to meet the tax people,

17:10.319 --> 17:12.880
then bring back the best deal they can offer.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.878
In that way you'll have a real case to argue.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.076
We had a similar choice when Father died.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.391
In the end, we let the house, but kept the land.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.199
Thank you.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.760
It's nice to know one's not alone.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.796
That others are facing the same trials.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.029
No. You're not alone.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.233
What's up?

17:50.320 --> 17:51.912
I've jiggered my bloody wrist, that's what.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.719
Oh, I'll have no swearwords in here,
thank you very much.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.119
Unless I'm doing the swearing.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.269
What's going on?

17:57.360 --> 17:58.349
Why aren't you upstairs?

17:58.440 --> 17:59.509
Jimmy's hurt his wrist.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.069
He can't carry the tray.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.149
What?

18:02.240 --> 18:03.309
I'll do my best, Mr Carson.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.549
Is something wrong?

18:04.640 --> 18:05.868
Why are you down here now?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.791
- Who's in the dining room?
- I'm going straight back up.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.718
I just wondered what the delay was.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.552
Oh, no, it's no good.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.119
Mr Barrow, you'll have to do it.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.433
Mr Carson, must I remind you
that I am the under-butler?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.317
I don't care if you're the high cockalorum.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.152
You're a footman tonight.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.359
Sorry, Mr Barrow.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.351
It wasn't her husband, it was a dog.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.035
I'm getting up a game.
What about you, Gillingham?

18:37.120 --> 18:39.315
- I don't think so.
- I'll join you, if you like.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.992
- Is there a place for me?
- Certainly.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.752
Shall I meet you in the smoking room
in ten minutes?

18:42.840 --> 18:44.159
Very good.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.554
I should be careful, if I were you.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.278
Sampson is a very sharp player.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.873
Oh, I think I can look after myself.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.598
Well, it looks terribly heavy.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.631
I'm playing cards with Sampson
and your father later.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.915
He'll have to talk to me
if we're sitting together at a card table.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.911
I hope James isn't really hurt.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.911
- Oh, I don't think so, m'lady.
- Good.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.110
But I suppose we'll have to muddle
through tomorrow as well.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.591
Don't worry about that, m'lady. I have an idea.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.429
You do realise we can sell land
as a capital gain

19:16.920 --> 19:18.353
and pay no tax on it at all?

19:18.720 --> 19:20.995
And end up with an estate
that can't support the house.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.913
I doubt it will change my mind.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.356
I'm glad you only "doubt" it.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.237
I must be making some progress.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.079
What's that?

19:34.400 --> 19:36.470
Is there anyone who wants to dance?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.909
I jolly well do. If it's with you.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.193
I love dancing,

19:42.880 --> 19:45.553
but these days I haven't got a partner.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.228
Tom?

19:48.920 --> 19:50.353
You're dressed for it.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.351
Would you care to dance with me, Duchess?

19:54.440 --> 19:55.793
I should love it.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.633
I hate to pass up the chance
to hold you in my arms...

19:58.800 --> 20:00.199
Why do you have to play?

20:00.320 --> 20:01.469
Because I've said I will.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.633
What about it?

20:06.480 --> 20:08.357
I thought I'd keep Granny company.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.797
Don't use me as an excuse.

20:11.040 --> 20:14.157
If you don't want to dance, tell him.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.879
Do you know Racing Demon?

20:24.440 --> 20:25.839
I've heard of it, but I've never played.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.554
I'll teach you while I'm here, if you like.

20:27.640 --> 20:28.959
We'll bring in some of the others.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.957
You need a pack of cards for every player.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.149
We can manage that.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.715
Anna?
Can you give me a hand with this shirt?

20:34.800 --> 20:35.915
I've got his shoes to clean.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.319
Of course.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.749
I'm very fond of Ireland.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.029
Where did you grow up?

20:46.080 --> 20:47.479
Bray, in County Wicklow.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.710
Oh, I love Wicklow.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.754
Of course you must know
the Powerscourts.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.910
I know of Lord Powerscourt, yes.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.352
Lady Powerscourt is my niece.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.032
Have you met her?

20:59.120 --> 21:02.237
I've seen her.
I wouldn't say, exactly, I've met her.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.951
I don't know why I'm doing this.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.592
By the way, I took your advice
and I'm pleased I did.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.750
- Thank you.
- Glad to be of service.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.474
Rose?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.033
Where did you get that?

21:29.560 --> 21:30.913
I found it in the attic.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.912
I got Alfred to bring it downstairs.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.470
- I'm so sorry, but I, I can't dance after all.
- Perhaps...

21:40.520 --> 21:41.953
What was that about?

21:43.240 --> 21:44.753
The gramophone.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.956
It belonged to Matthew. I didn't think.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.508
What a pity.

22:03.760 --> 22:04.875
Four nines.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.031
- You're too good for me.
- He's too good for all of us.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.554
Nonsense. I've been lucky, that's all.

22:10.880 --> 22:11.915
I'm wondering if I ought to stop.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.228
I'm in pretty deep.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.992
I'm in a lot deeper, I'm sad to say.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.958
Your luck is about to change, gentlemen.
I'm certain of it.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.232
I fit doesn't, how do you like to be paid?

22:21.320 --> 22:23.072
Oh, don't worry.
I'm happy with IOUs.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.394
We can settle up when we leave,
or at the club.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.668
Besides, you may
have won it all back by the end.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.273
Not a chance.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.679
I hope you can all keep my secret?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.911
I wouldn't want to worry Lady Grantham.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.076
We must practise our poker face.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.475
Antes, gentlemen...

22:42.640 --> 22:44.073
Goodnight.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.756
How are you enjoying the party?

22:46.840 --> 22:49.149
I look like a fool.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.558
I talk like a fool. I am a fool.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.436
Alfred said you were dancing.

22:54.520 --> 22:57.592
With an old bat who could be my granny,
and thinks I grew up in a cave.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.957
My clothes deceive no one.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.675
Don't be so hard on yourself.

23:02.760 --> 23:03.988
I'm a fish out of water,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.597
and I've never felt it more than today.

23:14.840 --> 23:15.829
Good day, m'lord?

23:15.920 --> 23:16.955
Good until tonight.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.951
I took a walloping from Mr Sampson.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.429
At poker.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.717
I was a fool to play with someone
who so obviously knew what he was doing.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.598
Lord Gillingham tried to warn me off,
but I wouldn't listen.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.194
- Do you know the gentleman well?
- No.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.272
But I was discussing the party at the club

23:32.360 --> 23:34.749
and he hinted a bit
and I suppose I took the bait.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.354
Anyway.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.233
Perhaps keep it to yourself, Bates.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.959
Of course, m'lord.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.229
Good man.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.994
M'lady?

23:49.680 --> 23:50.795
What's the matter?

23:51.280 --> 23:54.317
Did you know that Lady Rose
had found Mr Crawley's gramophone?

23:55.440 --> 23:56.839
I did, yes.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.512
She wanted it for her records.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.312
I told her to ask you.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.274
Well, she didn't.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.678
I feel very sad tonight.

24:06.760 --> 24:07.909
And no wonder.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.998
She shouldn't have had it brought down,
and set off all your memories.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.078
No, it's not that.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.752
At least, it's not only that.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.472
Sometimes I don't know
whom I'm most in mourning for.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.874
Matthew or the person
I used to be when I was with him.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.557
You're a fine person, m'lady.

24:28.280 --> 24:32.432
Fine and strong, and you'll learn that
for yourself as time goes by.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.317
I made rather an idiot of myself
in front of Lord Gillingham.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.319
He won't mind.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.715
No.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.076
No, I don't think he will.

24:50.640 --> 24:54.474
Can you stop a moment, please,
and let me out?

24:57.200 --> 24:59.475
Isobel. Isobel, my dear.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.718
Will you come up tonight and hear Melba?

25:03.560 --> 25:06.074
Well, I can't decide. I, I have a lot to do.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.033
Look, my dear, I don't want to be unkind,

25:09.120 --> 25:11.270
and you have my sympathy, truly.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.071
But it won't bring him back

25:14.560 --> 25:16.551
for you to sit alone, night after night.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.354
I know.

25:19.360 --> 25:23.035
But you see, I have this feeling
that when I laugh

25:24.240 --> 25:26.037
or read a book or hum a tune,

25:26.640 --> 25:28.392
it means that I've forgotten him.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.112
Just for a moment.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.358
And it's that that I can't bear.

25:34.040 --> 25:37.510
"Better by far that
you should forget and smile,

25:37.760 --> 25:40.638
"than that you should remember and be sad."

25:41.160 --> 25:44.277
But Rossetti was writing about her own death,
not her child's.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.399
Will you come?

25:57.360 --> 25:59.237
I came as soon as I got your message.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.432
I hope I didn't drag you away
from anything important.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.112
Oh, no, no, no, I've finished for the day.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.873
At Bakewell's?

26:07.080 --> 26:08.559
I am in a predicament.

26:08.640 --> 26:12.474
James, the first footman,
has sprained his wrist and cannot carry.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.950
Mr Barrow feels the duties are beneath him,

26:16.040 --> 26:18.076
and in the meantime, we have

26:18.160 --> 26:20.674
a party of sixteen staying at the house.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.119
You want me to be a footman?

26:24.200 --> 26:27.476
I know it is far below your talents,

26:27.560 --> 26:29.869
but you do understand the duties

26:30.280 --> 26:33.511
and since you are working at Bakewell's...

26:34.560 --> 26:35.993
You mean I can fall no further.

26:36.240 --> 26:40.631
I wondered if you might do us
the great favour of helping me out.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.550
I have come down in the world, Mr Carson.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.750
We both know that.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.514
I am a beggar and so, as the proverb tells us,

26:52.080 --> 26:53.479
I cannot be a chooser.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.109
Hmm.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.875
Do you know
if Dame Nellie has arrived?

27:03.360 --> 27:04.873
I believe so, m'lady.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.795
But too late for tea? What a shame.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.719
I was getting nervous, but apparently
Dame Nellie is here now.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.915
Good.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.876
Are you enjoying yourself so far?

27:16.960 --> 27:19.235
Ah, seeing the old house at full strength
again? Yes, I am.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.199
At any rate, I'm enjoying most of it.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.839
Only most?

27:24.160 --> 27:26.037
I don't want Sampson invited back.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.592
- I think he's rather a tyke.
- Hmm.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.839
How do you find Mr Gregson?

27:30.920 --> 27:33.036
Well, Sampson hammered him,

27:33.440 --> 27:35.078
but he took it like a man,
I will say that.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.039
I hope you weren't caught up in it?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.636
I was more of a spectator.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.792
I hate gambling.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.708
How can grown men
throw away their fortune like that?

27:44.800 --> 27:46.392
What could be more stupid?

27:46.480 --> 27:49.074
I couldn't agree more.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.797
Mr Molesley? I thought it was you.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.233
Are you a footman now?

27:55.280 --> 27:56.679
I'm having my career backwards.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.239
Ah, Mr Molesley.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.550
Alfred will be acting first footman tonight.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.471
So can you take your lead from him?

28:03.280 --> 28:04.429
Why not?

28:04.520 --> 28:06.238
Perhaps Daisy'd like
to give me a pointer or two.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.435
Or Ivy?

28:07.520 --> 28:10.353
And here are some clean gloves
that should fit you.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.032
Gloves, Mr Carson?

28:13.120 --> 28:14.951
I'm sorry, Mr Molesley,

28:15.040 --> 28:17.270
you're not the butler here.
That is my job.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.238
You are a footman
and a footman wears gloves.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.834
So if we could begin?

28:34.640 --> 28:36.039
Everyone ready?

28:36.120 --> 28:37.109
- Go!
- Hey!

28:37.200 --> 28:39.555
You're pushing!
You can't just bulldoze us all to one side!

28:39.640 --> 28:41.119
It's all part of the rules.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.428
Oh, I've got the ace...

28:47.080 --> 28:48.479
Oh, I've got the ace...

28:48.840 --> 28:49.955
Someone's cheating...

28:54.360 --> 28:55.634
What on earth can she be doing?

28:56.040 --> 28:57.393
Should someone go up and see?

28:57.480 --> 28:59.277
I thought she was going to sing after dinner.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.389
She is.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.596
Well, then why would we want
to see her before?

29:06.920 --> 29:10.071
I, er, I suppose you'll get
up a game again tonight?

29:10.160 --> 29:12.390
- After the singing?
- During it, with any luck.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.475
Then you must count me in.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.551
- You'll play again?
- Lf you'll have me.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.718
I think I've, er, got the trick of it now.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.638
Very well. If you insist.

29:20.720 --> 29:21.835
Don't say I didn't warn you.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.911
Do you know Isabella Moncrieffe?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.035
No.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.959
She's blown up like a balloon.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.474
What do you mean, she's in her room?
How long has she been there?

29:34.720 --> 29:36.790
Her maid took her some tea
when she arrived...

29:36.880 --> 29:38.916
- What?
- And I'm about to send up dinner.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.633
Well, doesn't she want to eat with us?

29:40.960 --> 29:42.393
I didn't think it appropriate, ma'am,

29:42.840 --> 29:44.478
and his lordship agreed with me.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.309
I can't believe my ears.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.314
Robert?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.150
A world-famous singer is in our house,

29:54.240 --> 29:56.390
a great artist honoured by the King,

29:56.600 --> 29:59.273
but you felt it beneath your dignity
to eat with her?

29:59.960 --> 30:02.315
- I don't re...
- Am I the only member of this family

30:02.400 --> 30:03.833
who lives in the twentieth century?

30:04.720 --> 30:05.755
What room is she in?

30:06.040 --> 30:07.268
Princess Amelia, m'lady.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.549
You will have her next to you at dinner,

30:09.760 --> 30:10.875
and you will like it!

30:11.040 --> 30:12.758
But what do I say to her?

30:13.080 --> 30:14.672
What does one say to a singer?

30:18.480 --> 30:19.879
I blame you.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.035
Now spoon it into the shells.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.079
No, not like that!

30:27.160 --> 30:28.229
Oh, give it here!

30:28.320 --> 30:29.355
Mrs Patmore, we can do this.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.751
Oh, can you?
With Ivy slapping it out like a trained seal.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.719
Alfred, just remember
that one's for the Duchess.

30:35.800 --> 30:36.994
She can't eat it...

30:37.080 --> 30:38.957
Oh, oh, my God...

30:39.640 --> 30:41.153
- What is it?
- I...

30:41.240 --> 30:43.151
I've got a pain like a vice, it's like a vice!

30:43.240 --> 30:44.309
Ivy! Fetch Mrs Hughes.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.674
Alfred, help me get her to a chair.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.716
No, but who'll finish the dinner?

30:47.800 --> 30:51.793
I've not made the béchamel yet,
nor the dill sauce for the salmon!

30:51.880 --> 30:53.757
- Daisy?
- But I've all me own stuff to do.

30:53.840 --> 30:54.989
I'll do it.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.389
- Madge is ringing for the doctor.
- Why? What is going on?

30:57.480 --> 31:00.950
Alfred's making the sauces for the dinner
and Mrs Patmore's having a heart attack.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.149
I'm not surprised.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.355
No, I mean really!

31:05.640 --> 31:07.551
- What on earth...
- Don't ask.

31:12.640 --> 31:13.675
Molesley?

31:13.760 --> 31:15.398
Oh, you're back? I'm so glad.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.590
They can't keep a good man down.

31:17.680 --> 31:18.795
On the contrary, m'lady.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.677
That's exactly what they can do.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.669
I'm going to slip away later, for some cards.

31:24.760 --> 31:25.909
I hope you won't mind.

31:26.280 --> 31:27.713
Not with Sampson again?

31:27.800 --> 31:28.835
You said you'd lost a packet.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.309
Well...

31:31.240 --> 31:32.275
Ah.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.273
It's time to turn.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.878
I'm so sorry about earlier.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.916
I hope you didn't feel we'd abandoned you.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.954
This is delicious.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.229
I'm so pleased you like it.

31:47.320 --> 31:49.629
Haut-Brion is one of my favourites.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.268
Did you read that on the menu?

31:52.600 --> 31:55.114
I didn't need to.
I've made quite a study of claret.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.119
Oh, well, then.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.919
This is going to be much less uphill
than I thought.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.992
I'll ring tomorrow and make an appointment.
Tom can come with me.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.833
I'm sure you don't need my help,
but it's yours for the asking.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.359
Thank you.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.953
May I take you out for dinner,

32:10.200 --> 32:11.189
when you're in London?

32:12.120 --> 32:15.635
I don't think Miss Lane Fox would approve.
And nor would I, really.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.154
But I can't tell you what a lift it is
to hear that you'd like to.

32:19.480 --> 32:20.674
Really?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.319
Is something the matter?

32:26.480 --> 32:27.674
I fit is, it shouldn't be.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.798
It's the first time I've heard her laugh
since it happened.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.995
I know,

32:34.080 --> 32:35.513
and I don't want her
to spend her life in sorrow.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.397
She's not the Lady of Shalott.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.514
It's just I find it hard
to join in the merrymaking.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.831
We haven't all been making merry.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.190
But you see, what it comes down to
in the end is this nice Lord Gillingham,

32:50.320 --> 32:52.470
or Sir John over there, or him, or you.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.313
You're all alive.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.868
And my son's dead.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.075
Anna.

33:23.600 --> 33:24.794
Anna!

33:25.560 --> 33:26.834
Anna!

33:30.120 --> 33:31.678
Are you so involved in your game,

33:32.640 --> 33:34.676
you were unaware
Mrs Patmore has been taken ill?

33:35.360 --> 33:37.396
What? What sort ofill?

33:37.480 --> 33:39.755
III enough to make this racket inappropriate.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.231
Well, I was going to win.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.239
Yes, I think you were.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.073
- Which is a good omen.
- What for?

33:49.840 --> 33:51.432
Never you mind.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.753
Why are you being like this?

33:55.840 --> 33:57.432
I was just having fun.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.711
- I'll leave you to it.
- Please do.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.838
Thank you for organising that, Mr Gillingham.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.634
It was terrific.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.795
- How is she?
- She'll live.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.279
I think it was brought on by anxiety,

34:15.360 --> 34:17.590
a sort of panic over all the things
that had to be done.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.114
There was a lot to be done.

34:19.199 --> 34:20.757
Yes, but you mustn't let it over power you.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.512
Can I listen to Dame Nellie?

34:22.800 --> 34:23.994
I think so.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.588
But put your feet up
when they've left in the morning.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.750
You should stay for the concert.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.112
Well, I don't want to be a nuisance,
but it does seem too good to miss.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.591
I'll go and put my bag in the car.

34:36.880 --> 34:37.915
I don't know.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.752
Screaming in the servants' hall,

34:39.840 --> 34:43.310
singers chatting to his lordship,
and a footman cooking the dinner.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.868
What a topsy-turvy world we've come to.

34:59.880 --> 35:03.429
I needed something to get me through it,
and I see you've had the same idea.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.709
- Are you all right?
- No.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.073
I'm afraid I've let you down.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.479
What? Why?

35:12.680 --> 35:15.433
Since Sybil died, you've all allowed me
to believe I was one of you.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.988
You are one of us. Now.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.032
No, I'm not.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.152
Not when you're among your own people.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.798
Tom, something's upset you.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.913
Was it the Duchess?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.275
If so, I wouldn't pay the slightest attention.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.158
It wasn't her fault.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.435
She was only trying to be nice.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.839
It was me.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.994
I don't belong here, and these past few days
have shown me that.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.868
I don't accept what you're saying,
and Cora certainly won't.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.793
But we must go now, or we'll get stick.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.036
Do any of you ever leave school?

36:12.440 --> 36:13.953
I'm sneaking off.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.474
- I wish I knew why.
- You will.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.675
I hope I didn't let you down.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.079
I'm sure you didn't.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.549
Mr Carson said they
gobbled it up like gannets.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.631
That's what I want to do, Mrs Patmore.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.873
One step at a time.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.392
I've got a bit of a headache.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.998
Because of the singing?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.989
Well, it's not making it any better.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.718
It was probably all that shouting in the game.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.831
And I'll thank you not to comment.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.399
I'll pop down and get something.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.358
And now for one of my favourites.

37:25.680 --> 37:30.037
O <i>Mio Babbino Caro</i> by Puccini,
from <i>Gianni Schicchi.</i>

37:30.400 --> 37:33.233
And I'd like to dedicate this to love

37:33.840 --> 37:35.159
and to lovers.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.079
What a relief.

37:37.160 --> 37:41.073
I thought we might have been in
for some of that dreadful German lieder.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.628
You can always rely on Puccini.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.948
I prefer Bartok.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.519
Oh, you would.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.155
Straight to the six.

37:59.640 --> 38:00.789
Flush.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.556
- I don't understand. How...
- How what?

38:06.680 --> 38:07.669
Come on, Sampson.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.950
You're not trying to get out
of paying up, are you?

38:11.920 --> 38:13.399
Of course not.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.711
Would you care for something stronger?

38:31.360 --> 38:33.237
I shouldn't let Mr Carson see you with that.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.594
- You want some?
- Uh-uh.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.591
I expect you're sick of it, too.

38:37.840 --> 38:38.909
A grown woman screeching

38:39.000 --> 38:40.911
like a cat on a bonfire.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.519
That's very naughty.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.670
I think Dame Nellie has a beautiful voice.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.119
Don't be silly. Let me pass.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.473
You look to me like you could use
a bit of real fun, for once.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.073
Is that what you want?

38:56.240 --> 38:58.037
What I want is to go back upstairs.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.433
You're not telling me that sad old cripple
keeps you happy.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.071
If you must know, yes,
he keeps me very happy.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.550
Now let me by. Please.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.599
Perhaps you've forgotten
what you're missing.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.518
I wonder what she's doing.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.072
Maybe she's fallen asleep.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.031
Well, she wouldn't get much sleep up here,
that's for sure.

40:46.080 --> 40:49.311
I think we're both even.
So we'll, er, leave you to it.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.399
I assume you'll take an IOU?

40:57.840 --> 41:01.799
Well, firstly I'll take all the IOUs
you've accumulated during your stay.

41:01.880 --> 41:04.155
You may send me a cheque for the rest.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.952
I'm not sure I can allow that.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.235
Well, you'd better allow it,
or I'll tell Lord Grantham how you won

41:08.320 --> 41:11.437
and there won't be a club in London
to touch you with a ten-foot pole.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.630
Will you take a note
for the remainder of the debt?

41:20.920 --> 41:22.148
Yes.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.629
It wouldn't be in your interests to cross me.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.233
You think you're so holy, don't you?

41:33.800 --> 41:36.360
You're just a cheat, like me.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.908
I have won against a card sharp.

41:40.600 --> 41:42.272
There is pleasure in that.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.999
I'm so pleased you came.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.868
So am I.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.916
I was wrong to hesitate. But then,

41:52.520 --> 41:55.159
guilt has the power
to make all of us do strange things.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.390
Oh! Well, not all of us.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.880
Guilt has never played a major part in my life.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.713
Amen to that.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.153
I think these are yours.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.671
- Oh, I can't accept this.
- Please do.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.918
I won it off Sampson fair and square.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.553
Fair and square, eh?

42:19.640 --> 42:21.995
Well, I won, anyway.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.158
- But then the money's yours.
- No, I don't want it.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.956
Isn't that a better way to end the house party?

42:28.640 --> 42:29.993
How did it go?

42:30.080 --> 42:32.196
Mr Gregson has saved my bacon.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.872
But don't tell your mother.

42:35.840 --> 42:37.512
How on earth did you do that?

42:37.600 --> 42:40.478
I revived a dubious talent
from my misspent youth.

42:42.440 --> 42:45.318
Well, that was a nice surprise,
I must say.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.949
My whole stay has been full of nice surprises.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.153
- I can't tell you how pleased I am that I came.
- Really?

42:52.440 --> 42:54.271
Then I'm pleased, too.

43:08.320 --> 43:09.912
- What is it?
- Whisky.

43:11.720 --> 43:12.994
God, it's huge.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.078
I thought you might need it.

43:20.280 --> 43:21.474
You understand me, don't you?

43:23.680 --> 43:24.908
I like to think so.

43:32.880 --> 43:35.348
Some fresh coffee, Mr Molesley.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.671
- Shut the door.
- My god.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.954
Shut the door.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.194
Will you help me?

43:44.800 --> 43:46.119
Will you find me some clothes?

43:46.200 --> 43:48.430
- Yes, of course I will, but...
- Then would you see to Lady Mary?

43:48.520 --> 43:51.796
Say, um, just say I've gone home
with a headache.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.872
I can manage Lady Mary,
but, Anna, we must tell someone...

43:54.960 --> 43:56.712
No, no, no!

43:56.960 --> 43:58.234
But you have to tell Mr Bates...

43:58.320 --> 43:59.799
Him least of all!

43:59.880 --> 44:02.440
If he knew, he'd murder the man
who's done it and then he'd be hanged.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.551
- But surely...
- He's a convicted felon!

44:04.960 --> 44:07.838
Do you think they'd spare him a second time?
 No.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.517
Maybe the doctor's still here...

44:10.800 --> 44:11.869
Will you listen!

44:11.960 --> 44:14.997
I need your help or I wouldn't have told you.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.436
Nobody else must ever know.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.994
You promise me!

44:23.000 --> 44:24.228
Wait here.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.515
I'll fetch you some water and a comb.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.273
And see what I can find you
in the way of a dress.

44:42.520 --> 44:44.829
Did you enjoy your evening?

44:45.920 --> 44:47.239
Yes, I did rather.

44:48.400 --> 44:51.790
You weren't too shocked,
having to talk to a professional singer?

44:52.560 --> 44:55.358
You always make me out
to be so narrow-minded, but I liked her.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.948
Because she appreciated your wine.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.951
There are worse reasons.

45:00.680 --> 45:03.319
And have you formed
an opinion of Mr Gregson?

45:04.360 --> 45:06.351
Yes, as a matter of fact.

45:06.480 --> 45:08.277
I'm not sure he's what we want for Edith,

45:08.360 --> 45:12.990
but it's a changing world and I must admit,
he's a decent cove.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.630
Heavens, a Damascene conversion.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.036
What's brought this about?

45:19.520 --> 45:22.239
- Was it something he said?
- It wasn't that so much.

45:23.240 --> 45:25.470
But he did behave in a way
that I thought was...

45:26.080 --> 45:27.593
really quite gentlemanly.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.359
Are you awake?

45:43.800 --> 45:44.994
What happened to you?

45:46.120 --> 45:49.556
I was drinking a powder
when I suddenly felt dizzy...

45:50.480 --> 45:51.913
and I must have fainted.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.310
I think I hit the edge of the sink
as I went down.

45:55.440 --> 45:56.634
Stupid.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.870
- You've changed your dress.
- Yes.

46:00.440 --> 46:01.759
It's badly marked.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.798
I've put it in to soak,
but I'm not sure I can save it.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.074
Mrs Hughes lent me this.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.632
Goodnight, Mr Bates. Mrs Bates.

46:11.080 --> 46:13.389
And thank you for looking after me
while I've been here.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.999
Goodnight, Mr Gillingham.

46:16.520 --> 46:17.919
Goodnight, Mr Gillingham.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.309
What's the matter?

46:25.800 --> 46:27.028
Nothing.

46:27.680 --> 46:29.432
I just feel like walking on my own, that's all.

46:42.320 --> 46:43.719
Anna?
