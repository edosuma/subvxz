Henry!

01:29.673 --> 01:31.471
Get out of here!

01:31.633 --> 01:35.763
Just go home
and leave this all to me!

01:35.929 --> 01:37.021
Go!

Liam?

03:50.647 --> 03:51.944
What's the matter?

03:58.280 --> 03:59.623
Hey.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.282
Hey, you found them!

04:00.449 --> 04:01.951
They were in a snow hole.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.744
I'd never have seen it.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.287
The camp blew away
in the night.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.924
Cheap tourist junk.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.334
Hawkeye here spotted them

04:10.500 --> 04:12.093
about half a mile up
over the glacier.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.424
Good work.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.756
Anybody hurt?

04:15.922 --> 04:17.845
They'll hurt when I bill them
for the fuel.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.640
Great, thanks.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.447
Henry.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.785
This is for Henry.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.071
Straight from
the governor's office.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.035
Henry Tyson's
medical adjudication.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.292
So it's only
a matter of weeks then.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.622
Yes.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.879
So now the governor
has no choice.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.672
Okay, boss?

05:03.011 --> 05:05.059
I've put your bowl
on the floor, sweetie,

05:05.222 --> 05:07.224
in case you're sick again.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.313
He was up three times
through the night

05:09.476 --> 05:11.069
and now he's got
a temperature.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.730
What is his temperature?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.318
I don't know.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.483
He's burning hot.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.823
So you haven't taken
his temperature?

05:18.985 --> 05:20.658
He's burning up.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.003
You asleep, kiddo?

05:29.412 --> 05:32.757
You've got your mum
all wound up now.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.839
You hear me?

05:35.001 --> 05:36.093
Liam?

05:41.633 --> 05:42.725
You not well, son?

05:42.884 --> 05:43.976
Liam?

05:51.935 --> 05:54.188
Why don't you call the doctor
if you're that concerned?

06:18.169 --> 06:18.840
Vincent Rattrey?

06:19.004 --> 06:19.755
Professor Stoddart?

06:19.921 --> 06:20.717
Hello, nice to meet you.

06:20.881 --> 06:21.723
Let me take that for you.

06:21.882 --> 06:22.724
Thank you.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.135
And their research suggests

06:24.301 --> 06:25.894
industrial perfluoroalkyl
compounds

06:26.052 --> 06:27.804
have begun to breach
the blood/brain barrier

06:27.971 --> 06:29.723
in arctic predators.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.392
Cannibalism's
a psychotic behavior.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.855
Bears devouring
other bears.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.773
I mean, it's the last resort
for any species.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.775
Just put it on the back seat.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.621
We've just come
out of the dark months--

06:44.779 --> 06:46.326
the winter dark.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.742
People are out
and about again.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.332
Bears, too.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.337
Does it not really
mess with your body clock,

06:53.496 --> 06:54.588
your mood and things?

06:54.748 --> 06:57.547
Don't people suffer
from depression?

06:57.709 --> 06:59.211
The opposite.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.344
Elation.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.676
They say "Glethi."

07:02.839 --> 07:03.840
Glethi?

07:04.007 --> 07:05.099
Glethi.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.764
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian,
Icelandic, Lap.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.273
We've got them all here,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.229
and I guarantee you'll
never know which is which.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.936
Friday evening,
I'll make dinner.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.194
I'll get Natalie round too.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.446
I'll have finished
my report by then.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.607
Lots to talk about, Vincent.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.654
Cannibalism's not the only
aberrant behavior we're seeing.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.246
What's the report on,
Professor?

07:31.409 --> 07:34.288
Environmental Impact Assessment
for a tourist development.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.671
While you're here,

07:35.830 --> 07:37.582
these are yours
for departmental use.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.877
You'll need your own rifle
and a hat.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.296
Something groovy
with earflaps.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.839
And, uh...

07:44.005 --> 07:45.973
...welcome to Fortitude!

08:13.034 --> 08:16.004
I read a review of this
only last night,

08:16.162 --> 08:18.665
and the man was saying
it was the very best

08:18.832 --> 08:20.834
digital projector
currently available.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.130
Like going to the pictures
at home, eh?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.718
I thought Liam was coming over.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.266
Liam's sick today.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.678
Liam's not coming?

08:33.638 --> 08:35.231
Have you two fallen out?

08:35.390 --> 08:36.642
No.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.520
What's that you've got?

08:40.687 --> 08:41.779
I found it.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.409
Found it where?

08:53.950 --> 08:55.202
Was Liam's
dad in the army?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.836
Afghanistan.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.293
His last tour
was February.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.504
So this is your first summer
in the Arctic?

09:01.666 --> 09:02.918
Yeah.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.428
Is it bad?

09:15.180 --> 09:16.853
Liam's got the mumps.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.606
Since he was sick last night,

09:20.769 --> 09:22.237
Liam has not
opened his eyes.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.489
Hasn't woken at all?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.194
No.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.655
Sleep is a healing strategy that
the body of a child employs.

09:28.818 --> 09:34.245
Liam's body is tackling
a heavy viral infection.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.626
You know,
even when a child is asleep,

09:36.785 --> 09:38.753
they can be fully aware
of what's going on around them.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.166
So what Liam needs
from us is calm,

09:42.332 --> 09:45.085
someone with him
at all times.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.969
Probably best
if it's his mother.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.631
Are you and Frank planning on
having any more children?

09:49.798 --> 09:50.890
Are we what?

09:51.049 --> 09:52.517
Has his dad had the mumps?

09:52.675 --> 09:54.052
Uh...

09:54.219 --> 09:56.893
He hasn't told me
one way or the other.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.978
Well, ask him.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.063
Tell him to give me a call
at the surgery if he hasn't.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.831
This could be a trunk.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.366
And that's a tusk.

10:16.533 --> 10:20.037
So it has to be a mammoth.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.046
I think it's
a prehistoric mammoth,

10:22.205 --> 10:23.548
thawed out of the permafrost.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.923
I think we need
to get out of here

10:25.083 --> 10:27.632
before any bears show up.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.092
We could both
use this, Jason.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.350
When that mine shuts,
I have nothing, Jase.

10:33.508 --> 10:34.851
Nothing lined up.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.101
Nothing saved.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.353
Nothing.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.773
Carrie's ten now.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.309
She needs things.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.317
We could try and sell this
to the Research Center

10:47.480 --> 10:50.074
as a scientific specimen.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.485
Split it 50/50.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.367
What do you think?

11:01.244 --> 11:02.587
Let's get it on the truck.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.773
Very impressive, Hildur.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.031
And now look.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.818
See?

11:33.985 --> 11:35.362
They've wired it up

11:35.528 --> 11:37.622
with teeny weeny light bulbs.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.408
It really comes to life,
doesn't it?

11:44.996 --> 11:46.714
It's time you and Henry

11:46.873 --> 11:49.171
sorted out your
differences, Dan.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.507
By taking him
his exile letter?

11:51.669 --> 11:52.921
Well, he can't die here.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.181
That's the law.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.225
Look, he's old,
he's lonely,

11:58.384 --> 11:59.306
he's dying.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.221
You're his friend,
so fix it.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.360
Margaret.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.896
Liam Sutter.

12:10.063 --> 12:10.985
Ten years old.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.399
What about him?

12:12.565 --> 12:13.817
He's got the mumps.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.360
99% sure mumps.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.618
But...

12:16.778 --> 12:17.904
But what?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.244
It just might be something else.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.370
Yes?

12:22.533 --> 12:24.376
Why are you telling us this?

12:24.535 --> 12:26.333
Because his dad
was in Afghanistan,

12:26.496 --> 12:31.297
and childhood poliomyelitis
is rife out there.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.633
Incubation period
up to 37 weeks,

12:34.796 --> 12:36.594
so it is possible

12:36.756 --> 12:39.555
we are just seeing it now
in Liam.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.310
Polio?

12:41.469 --> 12:43.187
It's a quarantine issue.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.064
You up for that, Governor?

12:45.223 --> 12:46.145
Seal off the town?

12:46.307 --> 12:47.479
It will be your responsibility.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.942
Well, wouldn't we just isolate
the Sutter child

12:52.105 --> 12:53.823
and quarantine the family?

12:53.982 --> 12:57.327
If he's been carrying polio
for the past 37 weeks,

12:57.485 --> 13:01.115
I think it's way, way, way, way,
way too late for that.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.409
I'll run some tests.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.089
Polio?

13:10.248 --> 13:13.092
I know.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.191
♪♪

14:22.487 --> 14:25.161
You're so gorgeous.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.500
So.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.881
You're search and rescue?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.509
Mm-hmm.

14:36.667 --> 14:41.264
What do you do
when you find out there's women?

14:41.422 --> 14:45.393
Do you swoop down
and save them?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.603
Yeah, something like that.

14:50.765 --> 14:54.611
Maybe they're gonna need someone
to save you from me.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.737
You think?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.739
Mm-hmm.

15:00.858 --> 15:04.453
You know, in this place...

15:07.657 --> 15:10.786
...things can come at you
from nowhere.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.831
Things?

15:14.997 --> 15:17.500
What kinds of things?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.544
Monsters.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.337
Monsters.
Mm-hmm.

15:21.504 --> 15:25.759
You won't see them,
you won't hear them.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.804
Until they have you
in their teeth.

15:33.683 --> 15:34.775
You know?

15:38.521 --> 15:40.273
And then they're gone.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.620
Into the darkness
before you know it.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.533
Hi.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.201
You're Vincent Rattrey.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.246
Natalie Yelburton.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.164
So...

16:38.331 --> 16:41.005
You're the guy that thinks PFAs
could be responsible

16:41.167 --> 16:43.044
for these reindeer abnormalities
I've been finding.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.088
You saw my paper?

16:45.254 --> 16:46.756
Skimmed it.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.472
So what's this
experiment here for?

16:49.634 --> 16:50.635
This?

16:50.801 --> 16:52.144
Oh, this is dinner.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.619
Where did you get this?

17:09.779 --> 17:11.076
Out of its mouth.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.957
Its mouth?

17:13.115 --> 17:15.083
I found a carcass.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.211
Thawed out of the ground.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.749
You know, wiry,
matted ginger hair, a trunk.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.464
Has somebody
put you up to this?

17:23.626 --> 17:26.596
No.

17:26.753 --> 17:30.008
There's an entire carcass?

17:40.768 --> 17:44.864
I mean, its value to science
is just incalculable.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.193
What's your name, please?

17:48.359 --> 17:49.451
Jason.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.540
So... put a precise number on
incalculable for me, Professor.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.960
How do you mean?

17:58.119 --> 17:59.416
What's it worth?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.581
It's priceless.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.624
No, I mean
what's it worth to you?

18:03.791 --> 18:06.761
How much will the Research
Center give me for it?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.671
No, you...

18:08.838 --> 18:11.842
No, you listen to me.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.635
The law about finds
of this nature

18:13.801 --> 18:14.768
is perfectly clear.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.723
Okay...

18:15.886 --> 18:18.856
Hey!

18:20.558 --> 18:22.356
Hey. I know you!

18:22.518 --> 18:25.021
Your name's Jason!

18:27.315 --> 18:28.407
Jason!

18:44.915 --> 18:47.134
Are you still
employed at the hotel?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.385
Yes.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.171
Has anyone in Fortitude

18:50.338 --> 18:51.931
spoken to you
about the incident

18:52.089 --> 18:54.888
or given you reason to believe

18:55.051 --> 18:58.305
they may have learned
about the incident?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.223
No.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.859
I'm required to ask you
if you feel safe in Fortitude.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.691
Yes.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.987
I'm required to ask you

19:10.149 --> 19:13.198
if you have any plans
to leave Fortitude.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.113
No.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.292
Because you know if you do,
you must tell us.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.543
Otherwise, you would be

19:21.702 --> 19:22.828
in serious breach
of your license

19:22.995 --> 19:24.087
and liable to recall.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.338
Mm-hmm.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.174
Are you seeing anybody?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.974
Is that an official question?

19:43.140 --> 19:45.939
Officially...

19:46.102 --> 19:48.651
it would be none
of anybody's business.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.040
Thank you.

20:14.463 --> 20:18.184
I don't like you going
up there without telling me.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.185
All I was doing was
going up to the cabin

20:20.344 --> 20:23.097
to fix the storm shutters.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.608
Listen, you stood in a bear
trap, for goodness sakes.

20:25.766 --> 20:26.858
You could have lost your leg.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.644
Okay, look,
I'm sorry, Hildy.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.610
I'm sorry.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.323
So how's everything
coming along?

20:37.486 --> 20:38.738
How's your speech?

20:38.904 --> 20:40.531
Do you need
any good jokes for it?

20:41.991 --> 20:43.584
The ice drill's en route.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.086
Really?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.336
Left Oslo
this morning,

20:46.495 --> 20:48.964
so it arrives on Wednesday.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.921
All happening

20:57.381 --> 20:59.930
Storm shutters.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.140
What?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.443
You're lying to me, Eric.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.713
<i>We live in the one place
on earth</i>

21:29.872 --> 21:31.795
<i>guaranteed a quiet life.</i>

21:31.957 --> 21:33.880
The honeymoon was a night
of thrills and...

21:34.043 --> 21:36.671
Thrills and magic,
thrills and magic.

21:36.837 --> 21:40.307
<i>Eric took me up
onto the glacier in a tent,</i>

21:40.466 --> 21:45.222
<i>and now we are building
a hideaway in the ice,</i>

21:45.387 --> 21:50.393
<i>a hotel hewn
into the glacier itself,</i>

21:50.559 --> 21:54.405
where lovers of the wilderness,
lovers of the Northern Lights,

21:54.563 --> 21:56.156
or just lovers...

21:56.315 --> 21:59.990
<i>Or just lovers.</i>

22:24.051 --> 22:25.143
Good morning.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.269
How you doing?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.180
Fortitude Police.

22:30.349 --> 22:35.480
Now, I see you're not
carrying any hunting rifles

22:35.646 --> 22:37.523
for protection
from the polar bears.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.987
I understand.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.776
I understand, sir,
where you're coming from...

22:40.943 --> 22:41.944
Good.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.328
But the waiting period
for firearms

22:43.487 --> 22:45.239
put that precaution
out of our reach.

22:45.406 --> 22:47.659
So that is that.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.168
I beg your pardon?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.670
That is that.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.003
See, we're only
traveling inland.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.337
No bears.

22:57.793 --> 23:02.299
No bears inland.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.477
What my friend means is
since, as we all know,

23:06.635 --> 23:07.887
polar bears
are coastal predators

23:08.053 --> 23:09.930
and we're not traveling
along the coast,

23:10.097 --> 23:12.816
then the recommended precautions
were not applicable

23:12.975 --> 23:14.648
in our time scale.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.274
How are you?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.613
I'm good.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.573
What's he doing?

23:25.404 --> 23:26.451
He's Norwegian.

23:26.614 --> 23:27.991
Ah.

23:31.285 --> 23:34.255
Look at this.

23:34.413 --> 23:38.839
A polar bear will be eating you
before you are dead.

23:39.001 --> 23:42.596
Once he has a hold of you,
he is eating you.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.508
This is all the bear left
of Billy Pettigrew

23:45.674 --> 23:47.972
once he was done
with eating him.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.479
So you need to go
back into town

23:50.638 --> 23:53.016
and equip yourselves properly
before you continue.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.105
Oh, fuck this.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.519
Fuck this?

23:56.685 --> 23:57.777
Fuck this!

24:03.859 --> 24:04.951
And fuck him.

24:25.506 --> 24:26.348
Hey!

24:26.507 --> 24:28.259
We have a gun!

24:47.444 --> 24:51.074
This would not stop me,
never mind a bear.

24:55.953 --> 24:58.832
So you will walk back
down the glacier into town.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.047
You will keep my rifle
for protection.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.463
When you get back,
you will bring my rifle to me

25:05.629 --> 25:07.302
and I will return
your handgun.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.936
Is that the cop
you told me about?

25:17.099 --> 25:18.726
No.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.815
I put that one
in the hospital.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.520
Do you mind if I make
more steam?

25:59.975 --> 26:01.067
No.

26:14.907 --> 26:15.999
That's me.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.506
Ah!

26:32.883 --> 26:34.556
Pints?

26:34.718 --> 26:36.937
For concussion.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.098
Are you taking wine
to the professor's?

26:39.264 --> 26:40.356
Yep.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.444
Who's that?

26:44.603 --> 26:46.480
It's the sheriff.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.945
Is he a good sheriff
or a bad sheriff?

26:49.108 --> 26:50.826
Well, no one knows.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.486
Why not?

26:52.653 --> 26:53.745
In Fortitude,

26:53.904 --> 26:56.748
there's two fundamental rules.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.750
You have to have a roof
over your head

26:58.909 --> 27:00.911
and you have to be able
to provide for yourself,

27:01.078 --> 27:02.955
so it follows
everyone's got a job,

27:03.122 --> 27:04.874
<i>no one is poor,</i>

27:05.040 --> 27:08.044
<i>so there's no stealing
and there's no crime.</i>

27:08.210 --> 27:10.338
<i>Everybody's always happy.</i>

27:10.504 --> 27:12.256
<i>Then there 's
nothing for him to do, then?</i>

27:12.422 --> 27:13.674
<i>So nobody knows</i>

27:13.841 --> 27:17.846
<i>whether he's a good sheriff
or a bad sheriff.</i>

27:18.011 --> 27:19.433
Henry?

27:19.596 --> 27:21.098
Drinking yourself to death?

27:24.059 --> 27:25.151
Join me.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.985
Do you want me
to throw this lot out?

27:33.152 --> 27:34.244
No, leave them.

27:41.451 --> 27:44.671
Are we gonna talk, Henry?

27:44.830 --> 27:47.299
"Billy Pettigrew
was a geologist," it says.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.004
Yes.

27:49.168 --> 27:53.594
"He was looking for something
up on the glacier."

27:53.755 --> 27:55.723
That's right.

27:55.883 --> 27:59.057
No wife and no kids.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.221
Just like you and me, Dan.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.311
Yes.

28:03.473 --> 28:08.070
And no mention anywhere at all
of the bullet that killed him.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.402
Nobody found a bullet.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.909
That was down to you.

28:14.067 --> 28:18.163
The state he was in, they
weren't looking for a bullet.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.541
If I don't keep myself
topped up,

28:20.699 --> 28:23.828
I shake like
a fucking leaf.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.261
I was stone cold sober
that morning.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.263
It was a mercy you shot him.

28:35.422 --> 28:39.222
A mercy I shot him.

28:41.428 --> 28:44.682
Meant to hit the bear,
but I shot him.

28:44.848 --> 28:45.940
Bang.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.318
Then the car door slams,
and I think,

28:52.481 --> 28:55.405
"No engine, no siren?"

28:55.567 --> 28:59.697
The car door slams,
and there you are.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.206
You were there.

29:01.365 --> 29:04.039
Weren't you?

29:07.955 --> 29:10.959
The Governor is advised
that your prognosis

29:11.124 --> 29:14.469
is now final stage
palliative care.

29:14.628 --> 29:17.552
You can go back
to the mainland, Henry.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.886
Tell me.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.801
You can die in peace
in a hospice,

29:20.968 --> 29:21.844
being cared for.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.353
Not by yourself in this hovel.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.638
Forget what happened.

29:24.805 --> 29:25.897
He was as good as dead.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.023
Tell me!

29:28.767 --> 29:30.394
I can't tell you.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.483
Why don't you trust me?

29:37.651 --> 29:39.779
If Frank hadn't shown up,

29:39.945 --> 29:44.121
another couple of hours,
I'd have gnawed it off.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.331
How long till
you can walk?

29:48.578 --> 29:50.046
I can walk now.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.256
Means I don't have
to sit through

29:55.419 --> 29:56.511
poor Hildur's presentation.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.388
Do you know a bloke
called Jason?

30:02.551 --> 30:03.723
Coal miner.

30:03.885 --> 30:04.761
Yeah, I know him, why?

30:04.928 --> 30:06.680
We had a fight.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.021
A fight?

30:10.183 --> 30:12.026
Well, more of a scuffle.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.654
He showed me a bit
of something that he'd found.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.406
What?

30:16.565 --> 30:18.238
Animal remains.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.494
What kind of animal?

30:20.652 --> 30:22.996
Can I just say

30:23.155 --> 30:25.499
if he did find it
on this island...

30:25.657 --> 30:27.830
You don't want to look like
a gullible arsehole.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.995
Can you arrest him?

30:30.162 --> 30:32.665
Find out if he's
telling the truth.

30:32.831 --> 30:37.302
Because if he is,
this thing needs protecting.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.007
I'll tell you what:

30:41.173 --> 30:43.517
when I get back, I'll pay him
a visit, all right?

30:51.850 --> 30:54.444
So what do we do next?

30:54.603 --> 30:57.857
We let him stew for
a while, mull it over.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.695
I'll go and see him again

31:02.861 --> 31:04.909
and tell him he's got 24 hours
to make an offer.

31:05.072 --> 31:08.246
Or the carcass gets torched.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.046
I'll go this time.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.297
Fuck with him.

31:14.456 --> 31:15.298
No, you won't, Ronnie.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.173
This thing needs calm
and fucking diplomacy.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.132
I mean, look at you.

31:34.059 --> 31:37.359
<i>Liam hasn't opened his eyes.</i>

31:37.521 --> 31:41.321
<i>He isn't responding to my voice
or his dad's.</i>

31:41.483 --> 31:44.703
<i>I think...</i>

31:44.861 --> 31:46.863
I think we need
to get him out of here.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.783
I think he's...

31:49.950 --> 31:52.829
I want him in a proper hospital
where they know what to do.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.621
I think he's much sicker
than that woman...

31:54.788 --> 31:56.040
Hey, hey, it's okay.

31:56.206 --> 31:57.708
I think he's much sicker
than that woman says.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.126
She's...

31:59.292 --> 32:02.171
I don't trust her,
that Dr. Allerdyce, she's...

32:02.337 --> 32:04.385
Jules, listen to me.

32:04.548 --> 32:07.222
If Liam is not better
by tomorrow morning,

32:07.384 --> 32:09.728
I will have him
airlifted.

32:11.388 --> 32:13.311
Airlifted?

32:13.473 --> 32:15.396
If there's no improvement
in Liam's condition

32:15.559 --> 32:16.731
by tomorrow morning,

32:16.893 --> 32:20.067
I will requisition a flight
to the mainland.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.982
Really?

32:22.149 --> 32:24.243
Yes, of course.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.118
Good.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.535
Now, I have to go.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.703
Have you met Elena?

32:34.870 --> 32:36.668
Elena?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.173
Hi.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.333
You must be Jules.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.219
Yeah, that's right,
Jules Sutter.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.176
You're married
to the Search and Rescue guy?

32:45.338 --> 32:46.260
The new guy.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.642
You know Frank?

32:50.093 --> 32:52.516
Well, I know who he is.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.732
How much does an ice drill cost?

32:59.895 --> 33:04.025
We'll recover the capital
outlay soon enough, Charlie.

33:04.191 --> 33:05.818
You're putting all your eggs
in one little basket.

33:05.984 --> 33:06.826
I have no choice.

33:06.985 --> 33:07.986
You know that.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.245
The mines are mined out.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.530
There's no future apart
from tourism, is there?

33:10.697 --> 33:12.290
Tourists.

33:12.449 --> 33:15.578
That's all the glacier
