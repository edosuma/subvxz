WEBVTT

00:07.010 --> 00:08.455
Previously, on House of Lies...

00:08.456 --> 00:10.029
I want to buy you, Marty.

00:10.030 --> 00:14.109
- We pay you to walk the fuck away.
- Go fuck yourself.

00:14.110 --> 00:15.570
Funny running into you
outside the dungeon.

00:15.571 --> 00:17.149
- I know.
- Uh, the, wha-huh?

00:17.150 --> 00:18.229
Doug and I play in a weekly

00:18.230 --> 00:20.039
- Dungeons & Dragons game.
- Right.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.179
You think you might consider
maybe going out with me?

00:23.180 --> 00:25.149
- Who the fuck are you?!
- Whoo!

00:25.150 --> 00:27.029
Wait a minute! Wait!

00:27.030 --> 00:30.000
I see you're getting acquainted
with my friend, huh?

00:30.338 --> 00:34.698

00:35.010 --> 00:37.169
Hey, Pop, I got to catch a plane, okay?

00:37.170 --> 00:40.109
Can you take Roscoe to school for me?

00:40.110 --> 00:42.039
Well, maybe if you spent

00:42.040 --> 00:44.009
a little less time on
that driving range...

00:44.010 --> 00:45.199
All right, I'll take him.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.079
I think it's good

00:47.080 --> 00:49.119
that you're getting all
this practice in, Marty.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.179
Can't have you looking like

00:50.180 --> 00:52.229
a duffer if we ever get out there.

00:52.230 --> 00:55.999
I think someone's angling for
an invite to your private club.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.039
- You think?
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.209
I'm a woman of the people.

00:59.210 --> 01:01.129
I play on the public course.

01:01.130 --> 01:03.109
But I'll make an exception.

01:03.110 --> 01:06.999
Uh, wait... Do they allow
black people at your club?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
That is so funny.

01:10.060 --> 01:14.079
Hey! Look at Roscoe on fleek!

01:14.080 --> 01:15.159
I'm launching my own vlog.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.039
You know, me in fresh 'fits

01:17.040 --> 01:19.179
- commenting on trends, you know?
- Uh-huh.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.129
Well, how's that fresh job hunt going?

01:21.130 --> 01:23.119
You know you still got
to get one of those

01:23.120 --> 01:25.009
for after school, right?

01:25.010 --> 01:27.129
Dad, I've been pounding the
pavement... nobody's hiring.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.009
All these businesses are concerned

01:29.010 --> 01:30.169
about the slow rate of economic growth.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.069
That's bullshit.

01:32.070 --> 01:35.099
Hey, Pop, isn't this usually
the time when you...

01:35.100 --> 01:36.169
All right.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.179
I really don't have time for this, okay?

01:38.180 --> 01:40.129
Just talk to him.

01:40.130 --> 01:43.049
What's up, my sexy bitches!

01:43.050 --> 01:45.119
Roscoe Kaan here. I'm in the Kaan loft.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.079
Today we talk about
suit jackets and pins.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.009
What?

01:51.010 --> 01:52.129
Uh, don't be pissed.

01:52.130 --> 01:56.999
I was trying to find a pen when
I found your bucket list...

01:57.000 --> 01:59.049
and read every word of it.

01:59.050 --> 02:00.999
What?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.159
Oh, my God.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.059
Tess, how could you?

02:04.060 --> 02:05.219
Doug, I actually think this is great.

02:05.220 --> 02:08.098
You are a confident, ambitious person

02:08.100 --> 02:11.019
who knows what he wants and
sets very tangible goals.

02:11.020 --> 02:12.189
- Well, yes, obviously.
- I mean, you knew

02:12.190 --> 02:14.999
that you wanted to go
through the car wash

02:15.000 --> 02:16.209
- with the windows open...
- Who wouldn't?

02:16.210 --> 02:18.149
And act in an episode of Bones.

02:18.150 --> 02:20.019
Okay, when I wrote the list, it was

02:20.020 --> 02:21.039
- the height of Bones.
- Okay, no, no, no, I...

02:21.040 --> 02:22.209
- Doug, I really do think...
- Then they did this whole

02:22.210 --> 02:24.049
- this is great.
- London season...

02:24.050 --> 02:25.149
Okay, "Send a message in a bottle."

02:25.150 --> 02:28.009
- Oh, I keep putting that off.
- Okay, "Witness a miracle."

02:28.010 --> 02:29.039
Oh, I've done that one.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.179
"Watch the movie The Bucket List."

02:30.180 --> 02:31.199
- I got halfway through it.
- Okay.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.129
I'll tell you what, how about I help you

02:33.130 --> 02:36.019
cross a few things off the list.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.019
"Receive oral sex in a
revolving restaurant."

02:38.020 --> 02:40.009
I could be on board with that.

02:40.010 --> 02:41.139
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:41.140 --> 02:43.139
I can also totally get you a TED Talk.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.089
Wait, you can get me a TED Talk?

02:45.090 --> 02:47.069
Thought the first thing

02:47.070 --> 02:49.149
would at least be equally as exciting.

02:49.150 --> 02:51.109
But yeah, the executive curator,

02:51.110 --> 02:53.159
she's my friend.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.159
Well, let's call her.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.999
That's amazing. Let's...

02:57.000 --> 03:00.009
go for it.

03:00.010 --> 03:02.009
Do you remember when we were doing that

03:02.010 --> 03:03.109
- economics problem set together?
- Of course.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.039
I got really frustrated and
I shouted, "Fuck me blind!"

03:05.040 --> 03:07.029
And then out of nowhere,
Ken pops his head

03:07.030 --> 03:08.189
out of some other room and is like,

03:08.190 --> 03:10.149
"Get me a blindfold!"

03:10.150 --> 03:11.229
Yes. Yes.

03:11.230 --> 03:13.109
Lot of confidence for
a bald 19-year-old.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.099
Listen, I'm really happy you called.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.199
- Yeah?
- I don't know if you know,

03:16.200 --> 03:19.139
but I kind of had... a
little thing for you

03:19.140 --> 03:22.129
back in the day.

03:22.130 --> 03:25.019
That's not why you called.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.109
Well, I mean, do a lot of girls

03:26.110 --> 03:28.049
ask you out to a romantic breakfast?

03:28.050 --> 03:30.089
So, what's up? What's,
so, what's going on?

03:30.090 --> 03:34.039
I'm working as campaign manager
for Seth Buckley's mayoral run.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.179
He's unhappy with the
economic advice he's getting.

03:36.180 --> 03:38.119
There's a meet-and-greet
fund-raiser with the candidate

03:38.120 --> 03:40.159
- on Thursday.
- Ah, Thursday I can't do it.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.229
I'm all packed up.

03:42.230 --> 03:44.999
Look, before, I wasn't meaning to...

03:45.000 --> 03:47.050
Not even a thing. Don't
even worry about it.

03:48.130 --> 03:50.089
Shit. You know what? I've got to run.

03:50.090 --> 03:52.219
But Thursday, you
should definitely come.

03:52.220 --> 03:54.179
There's gonna be free food, free wine...

03:54.180 --> 03:56.119
I mean, I'll be there.

03:57.190 --> 03:59.159
Come on, it'll be fun.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:13.110 --> 04:15.129
Sorry. Sorry about that.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.009
There was a miscommunication
with the nanny.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.149
There are lots of miscommunications

04:19.149 --> 04:21.139
with my nanny.

04:23.220 --> 04:25.139
Okay.

04:27.020 --> 04:29.069
I have about five minutes, so...

04:29.070 --> 04:30.199
So let's see the house.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.299
Your daughter's beautiful, by the way.

04:32.300 --> 04:32.999
Thank you.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.999
We're thinking of adopting
a black baby, too.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.039
- Where's yours from?
- My vagina.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.049
Well, his board's pressuring him

04:39.050 --> 04:41.079
to embrace the digitalization trend

04:41.080 --> 04:42.199
overtaking the auction world.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.079
Mm, but Daniel Hathaway
thinks the Internet is tawdry

04:45.080 --> 04:46.189
and commonplace.

04:46.190 --> 04:49.229
Thank God he has high-class
friends like us who get him.

04:49.230 --> 04:51.999
Mm-hmm. Bend to the popular whims

04:52.000 --> 04:54.049
of your less evolved cohorts.

04:54.050 --> 04:56.039
Daniel, no, dear boy,
perish the thought!

04:56.040 --> 04:58.119
You simply must triple
down on you, dear boy.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.179
We insist. You must purchase huge lots

05:00.180 --> 05:03.069
and conspicuous pieces.

05:03.070 --> 05:06.019
Uh, buy out student art shows

05:06.020 --> 05:08.099
and create new stars...

05:08.100 --> 05:10.089
Ugh! Sorry, I don't have
an ear for accents.

05:10.090 --> 05:12.999
And while this exceptionally
risky strategy

05:13.000 --> 05:15.179
puts Hathaway's auction
house and personal fortune

05:15.180 --> 05:16.219
- in great jeopard.
- Mm.

05:16.220 --> 05:18.169
We will sleep easy at night

05:18.170 --> 05:22.019
knowing that at the very
least, we fucked over a dude

05:22.020 --> 05:23.229
- who murdered his own wife.
- Whoa.

05:23.230 --> 05:25.109
Marty, I don't like what you're implying

05:25.110 --> 05:27.049
- about our judicial system.
- What do you mean?

05:27.050 --> 05:28.229
Daniel Hathaway was
acquitted, do you remember?

05:28.230 --> 05:30.129
Mm. Their fights were epic,

05:30.130 --> 05:32.219
and she stood to win a
lot in that divorce,

05:32.220 --> 05:35.029
but what reasonable
person wouldn't conclude

05:35.030 --> 05:36.149
she slept-walked off the balcony?

05:36.150 --> 05:38.229
How amazing would it be to be so rich,

05:38.230 --> 05:40.230
you could get away with
killing your wife?

05:41.230 --> 05:43.169
You know what I meant.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.119
- Tell us what you meant exactly.
- No, I think we know what you mean.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.009
Just like to make it
look like an accident.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.169
- Okay, we got it, we got it, we got it.
- In any case,

05:48.170 --> 05:50.039
kiddies, kiddies, kiddies,
Hathaway's has a market cap

05:50.040 --> 05:52.029
of three billion, so what do we say?

05:52.030 --> 05:53.229
- ♪ Go murder, go murder ♪
- Oh, oh, sure.

05:53.230 --> 05:55.999
♪ If it, if it's making money ♪
♪ Go murder ♪

05:56.000 --> 05:57.079
♪ Then murder. ♪

05:57.080 --> 05:59.069
Oh, wow! That's the politician girl?

05:59.070 --> 06:01.129
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no way she's interested.

06:01.130 --> 06:03.009
- Hold on. I can...
- Nope. I'm gonna seek other counsel.

06:03.010 --> 06:04.109
- Okay.
- We don't need you to do that at all.

06:04.110 --> 06:06.099
Marty, do we have business out of town

06:06.100 --> 06:08.029
on the 18th of next month?

06:08.030 --> 06:09.109
I don't know.

06:09.110 --> 06:12.039
Just have a thing back in
L.A. that night, you know?

06:12.040 --> 06:14.109
Yeah, if we have a road game that means

06:14.110 --> 06:16.019
I'm gonna have to fly
back in the middle of it.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.209
It's annoying.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.169
Yeah, I'll check with your assistant.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.049
It's fine.

06:21.050 --> 06:22.139
Unless you want to deal with
it personally, I mean...

06:22.140 --> 06:24.079
You know what? You know...

06:24.080 --> 06:26.039
If I ask you what the thing
is, will you just shut up

06:26.040 --> 06:28.089
and let me finish answering this e-mail?

06:28.090 --> 06:29.999
You were answering an e-mail,
right then, when I was talking?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.109
Oh, forget it.

06:31.110 --> 06:32.209
- I'm sorry, no.
- Okay.

06:32.210 --> 06:34.039
It can wait. It's not important.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.149
Good, good.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.149
Do you know what a TED Talk is?

06:38.150 --> 06:40.099
Does that ring a bell?

06:40.100 --> 06:42.019
They've asked me to give a
TED Talk, so you know...

06:42.020 --> 06:43.069
No big deal. Who cares?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.149
Sorry, hey. I'm sorry, Marty.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.999
Let me jump in there real quick.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.019
Doug, did you just say you're
gonna give a TED Talk?

06:48.020 --> 06:49.159
Oh, yeah, you heard that? Yeah, yeah.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.009
It's called "Be the Dungeon
Master of Your Own Destiny."

06:52.010 --> 06:53.029
And you're giving it?

06:53.030 --> 06:55.189
Yeah, should be pretty
enlightening, hmm.

06:55.190 --> 06:56.229
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you...

06:56.230 --> 06:58.129
Redfin has it as 1.8.

06:58.130 --> 07:00.049
I know Venice Beach is desirable.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.090
That's why I want to move there.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.049
I-I can go up to three, okay?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.129
Okay.

07:07.130 --> 07:08.209
Venice Beach?

07:08.210 --> 07:10.209
Oh, surprise!

07:10.210 --> 07:12.999
Not a surprise.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.009
We knew you were competing
for the Hathaway's job.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.099
I've just been insatiable lately.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.049
It's like I want everything.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.209
Gotta go big or go home.

07:19.210 --> 07:21.049
Oh, I hate that expression.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.009
You know who doesn't, though?

07:22.010 --> 07:23.209
Your old pal Skip, yeah.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.119
- He loves them big.
- Oh, yeah.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.119
Skip... I turned him down and
he goes Dumpster diving.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.079
Skip Galweather's sloppy seconds? Yuck.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.209
Yeah, when's your Hathaway's meeting?

07:33.210 --> 07:35.169
That would be tomorrow morning, boo-boo.

07:35.170 --> 07:38.079
Oh, this afternoon.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.129
Good luck.

07:39.130 --> 07:41.139
And you have shit on your blouse.

07:41.140 --> 07:43.029
I can't.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.089
Thank you so much. Excuse me.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.099
Hey, remember when that crazy
girl stabbed you in the leg?

07:48.100 --> 07:51.199
I will cut your dick off and I
will stir my champagne with it.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.099
Skip Galweather offers to buy K and A,

07:54.100 --> 07:55.219
and you don't think to tell me that?

07:55.220 --> 07:57.219
You were still working at Davis/Dexter.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.069
Oh, that's beside the point.

07:59.070 --> 08:01.129
That is a huge decision
that has implications

08:01.130 --> 08:03.129
on the financial
well-being of our child.

08:03.130 --> 08:04.149
Remember her?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.149
Well, if she's so high up on your list,

08:06.150 --> 08:08.059
maybe you wouldn't move her
to Venice Beach, right?

08:08.060 --> 08:10.069
- You can always sell your loft...
- Further away from her father.

08:10.070 --> 08:12.029
- And move closer to us, okay?
- That's a great idea, isn't it?

08:14.020 --> 08:16.199
Hi, I'm not a "I told
you so" kind of guy,

08:16.200 --> 08:19.219
but you did have a shot to
give me and Sarah the baby.

08:19.220 --> 08:22.000
Anyway.

08:25.180 --> 08:28.229
Here's the thing... I'm not
averse to increasing profits,

08:28.230 --> 08:32.149
but art wasn't meant to be
consumed like a quiz on BuzzFeed

08:32.150 --> 08:35.019
or a cat playing the piano.

08:36.030 --> 08:39.219
Remember that you have to die.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.129
What?

08:41.130 --> 08:43.169
"Remember that you have to die."

08:43.169 --> 08:46.059
It's the literal translation
of memento mori.

08:46.060 --> 08:49.029
Art that embraces mortality

08:49.030 --> 08:50.209
as a means of bringing us
to a closer understanding

08:50.210 --> 08:52.209
of the ephemeral nature

08:52.210 --> 08:54.129
of earthly endeavors.

08:54.130 --> 08:56.189
How much pee-pee's in your
underpants right now?

08:56.190 --> 08:58.149
Yeah, because I wear
underpants on game day.

08:58.150 --> 09:00.049
Our time here is limited.

09:00.050 --> 09:02.079
It shouldn't be wasted on trifles.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.029
Life should be spent creating beauty.

09:05.030 --> 09:06.119
Protecting beauty.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.009
Appreciating the beauty that

09:09.010 --> 09:11.029
appears before us every single day.

09:11.030 --> 09:12.219
Ah.

09:12.220 --> 09:15.129
Well, we couldn't agree more.

09:15.130 --> 09:17.159
You gotta keep doing what you're doing.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.039
Take it up to warp speed.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.079
Okay, so you think the strategy
is "go big or go home"?

09:22.080 --> 09:23.159
Yeah.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.179
Uh, go big or...

09:27.060 --> 09:28.179
Well?

09:28.180 --> 09:31.019
Uh, um, I can't.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.049
I'm sorry.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.159
Go big or go home...

09:34.160 --> 09:37.039
It must seem like an appealing strategy,

09:37.040 --> 09:38.119
and the smart move would be for us

09:38.120 --> 09:39.129
to tell you what you want to hear,

09:39.130 --> 09:42.019
but, uh, it's business suicide.

09:42.020 --> 09:43.039
- Oh?
- The art market

09:43.040 --> 09:44.189
is overinflated,

09:44.190 --> 09:46.149
the bubble could burst at any time.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.029
And I think that you've
been through enough.

09:49.030 --> 09:51.039
Losing your wife and then

09:51.040 --> 09:54.099
being accused of playing a part
in that is something I can't

09:54.100 --> 09:57.129
imagine how it would feel.

09:57.130 --> 10:01.009
I think the last thing that you
need is to be fed a destructive

10:01.010 --> 10:03.049
line of bullshit on top of all of it.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.229
What we need to do is
baseline your numbers,

10:04.230 --> 10:06.139
do a SWOT analysis,

10:06.140 --> 10:09.009
but you can rest assured
we'll take care of you

10:09.010 --> 10:10.169
and we will take care of your company.

10:10.170 --> 10:11.229
Absolutely.

10:11.230 --> 10:13.169
- 100%.
- I... I think

10:13.170 --> 10:15.059
- that's it.
- Yeah. Yeah. All right.

10:15.060 --> 10:17.009
- Great. Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.219
- Jeannie.
- Mm-hmm?

10:18.220 --> 10:20.049
Could you hang on for a second?

10:20.050 --> 10:21.129
Yeah.

10:21.130 --> 10:23.159
What was that?

10:23.160 --> 10:26.019
Mr. Hunky Murderer makes
googly eyes at her

10:26.020 --> 10:27.059
and then suddenly...

10:27.060 --> 10:28.099
all sense is out the window.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.089
Hey, Doug, you know how
there's the Olympics

10:30.090 --> 10:31.109
and the Special Olympics?

10:31.110 --> 10:33.029
Now, are you giving a TED Talk

10:33.030 --> 10:35.139
or, like, a Special TED Talk?

10:35.140 --> 10:36.209
Just a TED Talk.

10:36.210 --> 10:39.999
Doug... Monica clearly pitched
our strategy, all right?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.059
Now, we go in there and do
the same thing, we're done.

10:42.060 --> 10:44.100
It'll look terrible.

10:45.130 --> 10:47.009
What?

10:47.010 --> 10:49.039
Oh, go big or go home, right.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.149
Hello? You gonna fill us in?

10:52.150 --> 10:55.099
On that? Daniel just asked me to dinner.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.149
Uh... So you're gonna date him?

10:57.150 --> 10:59.149
So he's not perfect. Every
guy's got something.

10:59.150 --> 11:01.089
See, this one doesn't
clean up after himself,

11:01.090 --> 11:03.019
that one throws his
wife off a balcony...

11:03.020 --> 11:04.099
It's not a date.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.139
I'm just trying to win
us the consult. Jesus!

11:06.140 --> 11:08.139
Yeah. Okay.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.069
Well, looks like

11:10.070 --> 11:11.199
staying the course and not tripling down

11:11.200 --> 11:14.059
is their best move. See,
as other auction houses

11:14.060 --> 11:16.149
dive deeper into digital,
Hathaway's can actually

11:16.150 --> 11:19.149
parlay its purity into
an advantageous niche.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.079
Except the stay-the-course
strategy today

11:21.080 --> 11:22.999
means no afterwork tomorrow.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.189
Oof. Damn.

11:24.190 --> 11:26.169
Well, look, don't let
it get you down, buddy.

11:26.170 --> 11:28.059
Marty's not being critical.

11:28.060 --> 11:30.079
He... He's just pushing
you to be better.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.099
I'm sorry, what's happening?

11:31.100 --> 11:33.229
But how can we be better?

11:33.230 --> 11:37.199
Hmm. See, my role as Dungeon Master

11:37.200 --> 11:40.039
led me to a huge business
win for one simple,

11:40.040 --> 11:42.009
yet powerful reason.

11:42.010 --> 11:43.039
I was being myself.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.149
- Mm.
- Thus our journey becomes one of

11:45.150 --> 11:48.099
- seeking out and embracing our essence.
- Yeah.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.219
Look, take you, Clyde.

11:49.220 --> 11:51.059
Oh, please don't take me, Clyde.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.159
- No, let him take you, let him take you.
- You and Marty...

11:52.160 --> 11:54.099
You were riding high as Marty's go-to,

11:54.100 --> 11:56.199
then Jeannie comes back and
utterly displaces you.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.149
- She did do that.
- Mm.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.209
But you took solace, knowing you were

11:59.210 --> 12:01.999
- still ahead of good old Doug.
- Ah.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.099
But then, boom...

12:03.100 --> 12:05.069
I reel in a mega client.

12:05.070 --> 12:06.159
Are you serious?

12:06.160 --> 12:08.199
The good news is

12:08.200 --> 12:10.079
you can turn it around,

12:10.080 --> 12:11.159
but the answers, Clyde,

12:11.160 --> 12:13.999
well, they're not out there.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.099
Do you know where they are?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.129
- Don't.
- Oh. I think I know. I know.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.139
Marty, Marty, please don't

12:17.140 --> 12:18.059
- point to my heart.
- Is it in there?

12:18.060 --> 12:19.109
Precisely.

12:19.110 --> 12:20.159
That's where they are.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.059
Look, you're Clyde

12:22.060 --> 12:23.574
and you need to figure
out what that means.

12:23.575 --> 12:24.079
Mm. Okay.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.219
Be the Dungeon Master
of your own destiny.

12:26.220 --> 12:28.219
You know what? Winning Tess's business

12:28.220 --> 12:30.219
has nothing to do with
you embracing anything.

12:30.220 --> 12:31.999
It was just dumb luck.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.059
- Was it?
- Yeah.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.079
- Was it?
- Yeah...

12:34.080 --> 12:35.149
Was it? Yes!

12:35.150 --> 12:36.189
Where are we at on this game plan?

12:36.190 --> 12:38.109
Where are we at on this game plan?

12:40.020 --> 12:42.049
Did you just pack this along
in your bag, just in case?

12:42.050 --> 12:43.089
No.

12:43.090 --> 12:44.139
Daniel had it sent over for me.

12:44.140 --> 12:45.129
- What? One more time.
- What was that?

12:45.130 --> 12:47.179
Daniel had it sent over for me.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.209
So you're letting him dress you now.

12:48.210 --> 12:50.209
I mean, that's not creepy.

12:50.210 --> 12:52.049
Ever since Phoebe was born,

12:52.050 --> 12:54.159
I have been in sweatpants every night.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.219
So if someone wants to send me

12:55.220 --> 12:58.039
- a Zuhair Murad gown...
- A "Zuhaish Maan"?

12:58.040 --> 13:00.199
Zuhair Murad. I'm gonna fuckin' wear it.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.169
I'm gathering we still have nothing?

13:02.170 --> 13:03.999
I'm actually onto something.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.049
Nah.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.129
We'll drill down and we'll ping you

13:06.130 --> 13:07.159
when we're a little further
up the learning curve.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.099
What the fuck is going on today?

13:09.100 --> 13:10.119
- This is insane.
- Okay, great.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.079
Okay. Well, have fun at
the ball, Cinderella.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.139
- Thank you.
- Hey, just remember...

13:13.140 --> 13:15.039
that gown, at midnight,

13:15.040 --> 13:17.009
turns back into your blouse
with the shit stain on it.

13:17.010 --> 13:18.099
Try not to get murdered.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.099
Avoid the balcony!

13:19.100 --> 13:20.099
Have fun with O.J.!

13:20.100 --> 13:22.200
Clyde.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.039
You look magnificent.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.179
Thank you.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.200
Please.

13:32.130 --> 13:34.049
So where are we going?

13:34.050 --> 13:35.060
The Met.

13:36.170 --> 13:38.060
Isn't the Met closed?

13:46.100 --> 13:48.060
Not for the two of us.

13:51.050 --> 13:54.180
You have a key to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art?

13:59.130 --> 14:00.189
How do you have a key?

14:00.190 --> 14:02.070
You ask a lot of questions.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.230
I like that.

14:09.110 --> 14:12.019
I mean, there's no chance that he...

14:12.020 --> 14:14.059
he actually kills her, right?

14:14.060 --> 14:15.169
- Oh, God, no. No way. No.
- Mm-mm.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.099
It's, like, a three percent chance.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.209
- It's, like, five, tops.
- Right. Right.

14:18.210 --> 14:21.219
You know, Daniel actually
had a first wife.

14:21.220 --> 14:24.129
Died in a car accident,

14:24.130 --> 14:25.179
but in light of later events,

14:25.180 --> 14:28.049
not so clear it was an accident.

14:28.050 --> 14:30.000
Huh.

14:34.030 --> 14:35.069
Nah, she gonna be all right.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.209
- I think so. Right?
- Oh, are you kidding me?

14:36.210 --> 14:38.059
- It's Jeannie!
- You don't mess with Jeannie!

14:38.060 --> 14:40.099
Right? I do not want to be the guy

14:40.100 --> 14:41.199
who tries to murder Jeannie.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.199
Don't try it.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.149
But if she does get killed,

14:44.150 --> 14:45.209
I get her office back, though, right?

14:45.210 --> 14:46.219
Come on. Absolutely.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.199
Thank you!

14:47.200 --> 14:49.029
After an appropriate mourning period...

14:49.030 --> 14:50.139
- All right.
- Clyde's office.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.099
'Cause I know exactly what
I want to do with it.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.160
I bought stuff for it.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.069
We don't want her to
actually die, Clyde.

14:58.070 --> 14:59.199
I know.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.120
Of course... stop. Of course not.

15:04.180 --> 15:07.189
Jose Cuervo 250.

15:07.190 --> 15:09.119
No, no, I didn't... I didn't order...

15:09.120 --> 15:13.020
You... have an admirer.

15:20.090 --> 15:23.129
$2,000 bottle of tequila, huh?

15:23.130 --> 15:25.149
Yeah. I can afford it, though, Marty.

15:25.150 --> 15:27.129
Seven times.

15:27.130 --> 15:28.119
Seven times what?

15:28.120 --> 15:30.009
Seven times my revenue.

15:30.010 --> 15:31.089
When Skip buys my firm,

15:31.090 --> 15:33.049
that's what he's going
to put in my pocket.

15:33.050 --> 15:35.049
But don't worry, I will
probably throw you

15:35.050 --> 15:37.009
a pity fuck on my private jet.

15:37.010 --> 15:39.009
Oh, that's sweet.

15:39.010 --> 15:40.099
Yeah, I know.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.099
Bye.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.209
Bye, Mo.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.059
Hey.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.169
Buck up, you.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.170
You'll get your own fuck jet one day.

15:51.090 --> 15:52.219
Oh! What's that doing there?

15:52.220 --> 15:54.010
Sorry.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.209
The food is delicious.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.179
And, um, this room is stunning.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.219
Interesting fact...

16:03.220 --> 16:06.129
Initially, neoclassicism was considered

16:06.130 --> 16:08.099
something of a fad for
the Parisian elite,

16:08.100 --> 16:12.169
until Marie Antoinette brought
the goût grec to Versailles

16:12.170 --> 16:17.009
and reappropriated it
as Louis XVI style.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.059
- I'm being so boring.
- No.

16:19.060 --> 16:22.019
No, I actually have always
wanted to learn more about art.

16:22.020 --> 16:24.089
I didn't grow up with much around me.

16:24.090 --> 16:25.999
We only had two pieces.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.139
One was, um, dogs playing poker...

16:27.140 --> 16:29.009
A fantastic piece.

16:29.010 --> 16:30.199
And, uh, a paint-by-numbers Johnny Cash.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.099
I don't know that one.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.219
It's very rare.

16:33.220 --> 16:35.139
But I imagine there was warmth and love.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.109
Not so much?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.079
Not so much, no.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.169
I think that's why

16:43.170 --> 16:45.009
I wanted to have a kid, you know?

16:45.010 --> 16:48.029
Do the whole "better than
they had done" thing.

16:48.030 --> 16:49.110
How's that going?

16:55.060 --> 16:57.029
Should we be talking business?

16:57.030 --> 16:58.119
'Cause I'm billing you for this.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.159
Quite right.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.010
I want to get my bloody money's worth.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.079
Our end state vision for you

17:04.079 --> 17:06.108
is to keep your brick and mortar strong,

17:06.109 --> 17:09.150
while creating a separate online brand.

17:11.150 --> 17:12.189
- Mmm...
- I know,

17:12.190 --> 17:14.079
but we're envisioning it

17:14.079 --> 17:15.999
as a purely VIP experience,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.229
dealing only in exclusive pieces,

17:17.230 --> 17:19.039
while maintaining

17:19.040 --> 17:20.138
a prohibitive pay wall

17:20.140 --> 17:22.040
and a capped number of members.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.029
I like that.

17:26.030 --> 17:27.079
Great.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.169
I really like that.

17:29.170 --> 17:32.169
You know...

17:32.170 --> 17:34.029
it's such a beautiful night,

17:34.030 --> 17:36.009
and it's a full moon.

17:36.010 --> 17:38.090
I think we should go up to the roof.

17:39.230 --> 17:42.020
You know, I'm not that into the moon.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.229
Not into the moon,

17:45.230 --> 17:48.009
or not into going up to the roof

17:48.010 --> 17:49.149
with a man who's been accused

17:49.150 --> 17:51.169
of pushing someone off a high balcony?

17:53.140 --> 17:54.999
- Little bit of both.
- Okay.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.179
Well, don't worry,

17:57.180 --> 17:59.210
I only kill my wives.

18:01.220 --> 18:03.119
Hold up. He actually said that?

18:03.120 --> 18:04.219
He told you you looked like his wife?

18:04.220 --> 18:06.089
It sounds creepier than it wa...

18:06.090 --> 18:08.019
No, wait, did he, did he say
the one that he maybe killed,

18:08.020 --> 18:09.069
or the one that he definitely killed?

18:09.070 --> 18:10.179
- I didn't ask.
- Well, that's smart.

18:10.180 --> 18:12.009
Okay, so you're on the
roof at this point.

18:12.010 --> 18:13.089
How'd you get out of there?

18:13.090 --> 18:15.089
I just put my clothes on and left.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.169
- Okay.
- She just put her clothes on and left.

18:16.170 --> 18:17.229
Oh, fucking, fucking...

18:17.230 --> 18:20.109
You were supposed to receive
a cancellation call.

18:20.110 --> 18:23.030
Mr. Hathaway has decided to go
with another consulting firm.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.060
Excuse me?

18:27.190 --> 18:29.119
You can't go back there!

18:29.120 --> 18:30.189
It's okay, we know each other.

18:30.190 --> 18:32.029
She fucked him last night

18:32.030 --> 18:33.159
on the roof of the Met, so we're good.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.059
Thank you, though.

18:35.060 --> 18:37.059
I'm confused. I thought,

18:37.060 --> 18:39.099
when I left last night,
we were in agreement,

18:39.100 --> 18:42.089
and now I'm finding out you
gave the consult to that cunt?

18:42.090 --> 18:43.129
Okay, hold on a second.

18:43.130 --> 18:44.209
Um, sorry, I'm supposed to hand over

18:44.210 --> 18:46.139
a multimillion-dollar
consult just because...

18:46.140 --> 18:48.059
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.099
Yeah, I don't think you get to stake out

18:49.100 --> 18:50.189
the moral high ground, Jeannie.

18:50.190 --> 18:52.129
Sorry, but we used each other.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.139
Yeah, I wanted to have sex with
you; you wanted my business.

18:54.140 --> 18:56.209
I didn't fuck you for the business.

18:56.210 --> 18:59.189
I actually... Uh, even if I did,

18:59.190 --> 19:02.039
I can absolutely stake out the
moral high ground with you.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.129
What's that supposed to mean?

19:03.130 --> 19:06.029
I don't know. Let's ask one
of your wives. Oh, wait.

19:06.030 --> 19:07.389
This doesn't seem like a good road.

19:07.390 --> 19:07.999
- No.
- No.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.049
I mean, what's lying to
someone you just met when

19:10.050 --> 19:11.059
you've sent a loved one hurtling

19:11.060 --> 19:12.189
over a third-story balcony?

19:12.190 --> 19:14.209
Ooh, I wouldn't have said that part.

19:14.210 --> 19:16.109
Should we be intervening?

19:17.220 --> 19:18.219
Oh, sure.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.219
Stop. That's an original.

19:20.220 --> 19:23.189
Hey! Hey! Hey!

19:23.190 --> 19:25.020
Get the fuck out. Get out.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.199
Caught it.

19:31.180 --> 19:34.059
Clyde!

19:34.060 --> 19:36.159
- Oh, my God, you came!
- Hey.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.229
Hey, I'm so glad. Come on.

19:37.230 --> 19:39.139
I'll, um... I'll introduce
you to the candidate.

19:39.140 --> 19:41.190
Yes. Please.

19:42.190 --> 19:44.109
Hey.

19:44.110 --> 19:46.159
Congratulate me, Dad.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.069
Somebody get a job?

19:48.070 --> 19:50.059
I got a lead on a job.

19:50.060 --> 19:51.209
Several jobs, actually.

19:51.210 --> 19:53.229
I mean, I got myself a modeling agent.

19:53.230 --> 19:56.119
That's not what we talked about, Roscoe.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.069
But, Dad, if it goes through,
it's gonna be a lot better money

19:59.070 --> 20:00.219
than working at Domino's.

20:00.220 --> 20:03.069
Yeah, well, you're still gonna
get a real job after school.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.109
So I have to be miserable
because you are?

20:05.110 --> 20:06.149
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!

20:06.150 --> 20:08.149
You're getting it. You see
how smart this kid is?

20:08.150 --> 20:10.209
Grandpa, tell Dad he's being

20:10.210 --> 20:12.069
totally unreasonable.

20:12.070 --> 20:14.119
Grandpa, tell Roscoe that
you are still driving him

20:14.120 --> 20:16.999
around tomorrow after school
to get job applications.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.219
Uh, I can't tomorrow. I'll
be in San Diego tomorrow.

20:19.220 --> 20:23.029
It's Rita's niece's confirmation.

20:23.030 --> 20:25.039
Oh. Uh, how long are
you going to be gone?

20:25.040 --> 20:28.099
Oh, just a few days. Hmm?

20:28.100 --> 20:29.219
- Mm, maybe more.
- Mm-hmm.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.119
Well, I'm just asking because,

20:31.120 --> 20:33.229
you know, Phoebe's gonna
be here this weekend.

20:35.210 --> 20:38.109
No. This-this is not the moment.

20:38.110 --> 20:40.049
- Not the moment?
- Uh-uh.

20:40.050 --> 20:42.219
Sweetheart, you are a
68-year-old with Parkinson's.

20:42.220 --> 20:45.159
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you
have nothing but time.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.029
- Okay? Okay?
- Okay. All right.

20:47.030 --> 20:48.079
You got this.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.199
That's... Okay.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.200
She... she...

20:53.030 --> 20:55.119
Roscoe, could you give us a moment?

20:55.120 --> 20:57.129
Yeah.

20:57.130 --> 21:01.119
Why do I feel like I'm in
the principal's office?

21:01.120 --> 21:05.089
I've... done you a disservice.

21:05.090 --> 21:07.009
- What are you talking about?
- Knowing that

21:07.010 --> 21:09.009
I was there for Roscoe,

21:09.010 --> 21:11.119
both physically and emotionally...

21:11.120 --> 21:14.199
You've been able to skate by?

21:14.200 --> 21:16.039
And you're still...

21:16.040 --> 21:18.119
Now, you're still skating by.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.209
That's no good.

21:19.210 --> 21:21.099
That's no good for Roscoe.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.209
It's... no good for Phoebe.

21:23.210 --> 21:26.019
That's no good for you.

21:26.020 --> 21:29.199
I was ready to enjoy my retirement

21:29.200 --> 21:32.139
a long time ago, you know?

21:32.140 --> 21:35.099
Don't get me wrong. I-I wouldn't...

21:35.100 --> 21:37.099
I wouldn't give up my
time with these kids

21:37.100 --> 21:41.069
for nothing in the world, but...
I want to be their grandfather.

21:41.070 --> 21:43.079
You know? I want to...
I want to spoil them.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.039
I want to...

21:45.040 --> 21:47.099
give her piggyback rides, and...

21:47.100 --> 21:49.069
too much candy, and...

21:49.070 --> 21:54.019
and dump 'em back in
their father's hands...

21:54.020 --> 21:56.139
so you can do the parenting.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.109
Hmm?

21:58.110 --> 22:00.100
Like I know you can.

22:02.180 --> 22:04.189
Tell him what you were thinking.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.059
Seth, you're gonna love this.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.099
All right, I roughed out some numbers,

22:07.100 --> 22:08.219
and there's actually a
feasible path forward

22:08.220 --> 22:10.199
on a government-private
sector partnership

22:10.200 --> 22:13.149
that will step up the building
of desalination plants.

22:13.150 --> 22:14.179
That's a good idea.

22:14.180 --> 22:16.069
I know. It feels like
a good idea, right?

22:16.070 --> 22:18.069
Hi. Excuse me for just a moment, guys.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.209
Yeah, of course. Course.

22:19.210 --> 22:21.069
No, no, no, that's great, that's great.

22:21.070 --> 22:23.009
But how do you control costs?

22:23.010 --> 22:25.079
Yeah, well, most of it
is actually defrayed

22:25.080 --> 22:27.179
by the businesses.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.049
She's pretty. Ah.

22:29.050 --> 22:31.029
Bronwyn, yeah. And smart.

22:31.030 --> 22:32.109
Mmm.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.059
That's why you're here, isn't it?

22:34.060 --> 22:35.149
Also heard there was free food.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.079
Well, I hate to burst your bubble,

22:37.080 --> 22:39.109
but the food is not free.

22:39.110 --> 22:41.089
- I'm kidding. It's free.
- Right.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.119
But I'm fairly certain
Bronwyn is a lesbian.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.049
Nope, absolutely not.

22:45.050 --> 22:46.189
Actually, I'm certain
that she's a lesbian,

22:46.190 --> 22:50.109
because I officiated her wedding
to Katie, who is a woman.

22:50.110 --> 22:55.019
So, lesbian and married. Fantastic.

22:55.020 --> 22:58.039
However she got you here,
though, I'm glad you're here.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.039
I'd like for you to advise the campaign.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.069
I'm not really a politics guy.

23:01.070 --> 23:03.019
Could have fooled me.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.199
Look, I know you got a day job,

23:04.200 --> 23:06.199
and you're probably kicking
ass at Kaan & Associates.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.059
But this is an opportunity
for you to get in

23:08.060 --> 23:10.079
on the ground floor of something
that's potentially great,

23:10.080 --> 23:13.079
and to be an essential component
of what makes it great.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.029
All right, I want you
to be part of this.

23:15.030 --> 23:17.149
- I'm not taking no for an answer.
- Uh...

23:17.150 --> 23:18.999
I'm kidding.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.199
I will take no for an answer,
but it would make me very sad.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.059
And nobody's gonna vote for
a guy who looks like this.

23:25.090 --> 23:27.169
Yeah, I wouldn't vote for that guy.

23:27.170 --> 23:30.229
See, you're already advising me.

23:32.180 --> 23:34.059
I thought she was hungry.
She's not hungry.

23:34.060 --> 23:35.219
Okay, there's no fever.

23:35.220 --> 23:38.089
It's not gas. She's just been
crying and crying. I can't get

23:38.090 --> 23:40.069
- her to go to sleep. She won't sleep.
- It's okay. It's okay.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.179
- She will not sleep, Marty.
- Shh, shh, shh. It's okay, good.

23:41.180 --> 23:44.069
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Oh.

23:44.070 --> 23:45.199
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.209
Shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh.

23:47.210 --> 23:50.229
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, it's okay.

23:50.230 --> 23:53.169
So, uh, Pop used to do this thing.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.119
- Shh. Can you lay that out for me?
- Yes.

23:57.210 --> 23:59.069
Yes.

23:59.070 --> 24:02.219
Called it the five S's.

24:02.220 --> 24:05.179
You swaddle. Shh...

24:08.010 --> 24:09.159
I know, I know.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.089
Swaddle. Okay.

24:12.090 --> 24:15.109
You swing.

24:15.110 --> 24:17.209
Shush.

24:17.210 --> 24:19.039
And side.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.099
Shh.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.089
I know. Shh, shh, shh.

24:22.090 --> 24:25.140
And stick the pacifier in its mouth.

24:27.230 --> 24:30.039
Is she asleep?

24:30.040 --> 24:31.179
That's called sleep.

24:31.180 --> 24:33.099
Fuck you.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.149
Yeah.

24:34.150 --> 24:36.159
Maybe you don't want to
be moving, uh, far away

24:36.160 --> 24:38.019
from the baby whisperer at this point.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.040
Just sayin'.

24:43.230 --> 24:45.120
I was outbid on the house anyway.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.209
Shit.

24:47.210 --> 24:48.219
Look, Jeannie,

24:48.220 --> 24:50.199
you can move if you want to, obviously.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.189
That's your prerogative.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.209
Not even sure I want to move.

24:53.210 --> 24:55.060
I just want...

24:56.100 --> 24:58.119
I don't even know what I want.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.199
And I should have told
you about the offer.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.150
Yeah, you should have.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.169
Speaking of which, Monica tells me

25:07.170 --> 25:10.029
that... Skip is prepared

25:10.030 --> 25:13.009
to shell out seven times
her firm's revenue.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.189
- Are you kidding?
- Seven times.

25:14.190 --> 25:18.169
That multiplier is five
times on a good day.

25:18.170 --> 25:21.209
Wow. Well, at least the money's
going to someone deserving,

25:21.210 --> 25:23.209
- like Monica.
- Mmm.

25:23.210 --> 25:27.039
If it goes to Monica.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.059
So, you know, Skip is
eyeing a number of firms.

25:30.060 --> 25:33.040
Sure, most of them can't compete.

25:35.010 --> 25:37.009
Most of them can't,

25:37.010 --> 25:40.189
but some of them can?

25:40.190 --> 25:44.999
I mean, it is so much money
to just walk away from.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.050
- Are you considering...?
- I don't know, I don't know.

25:49.220 --> 25:51.199
- Maybe.
- Wow...

25:51.200 --> 25:56.149
God, could you imagine
stepping off the hamster wheel

25:56.150 --> 25:59.079
for a while, and having the time

25:59.080 --> 26:02.079
and the financial wherewithal

26:02.080 --> 26:05.119
to reflect on what comes next?

26:05.120 --> 26:07.099
Yeah, we don't even need to
reflect on what comes next.

26:07.100 --> 26:10.020
You know, just... be.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.119
Marty Kaan, secret Buddhist.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.040
We could... be there for
Phoebe in a very real way.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.049
You know, she wouldn't see

26:23.050 --> 26:26.129
the stressed-out versions
of ourselves from work.

26:26.130 --> 26:27.119
Yeah.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.209
And no travel.

26:28.210 --> 26:30.159
- How about that?
- No travel.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.169
- Yeah.
- No.

26:31.170 --> 26:34.099
Or yes to travel, but only good travel.

26:34.100 --> 26:36.119
- Yeah.
- When I was little,

26:36.120 --> 26:39.119
I always wanted to go to Barcelona.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.029
I don't even think I
knew it was in Spain.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.219
I just... It sounded so fancy.

26:43.220 --> 26:45.190
We could bring Phoebe.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.089
Uh, I'm not saying "we." I...

26:50.090 --> 26:51.229
- I could her... bring her, or you...
- No, no, no.

26:51.230 --> 26:53.139
- Could bring her separately.
- No, no. No, yeah, no. No.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.139
"We" is... No, we could...
we could bring Phoebe.

26:55.140 --> 26:57.029
We may, you know, we could
travel as a family.

26:57.030 --> 26:58.209
Bring Roscoe, too.

26:58.210 --> 27:02.189
"We" doesn't have to mean, you know, we.

27:02.190 --> 27:06.069
Hell, maybe we take
this away from Monica,

27:06.070 --> 27:07.189
she even kills herself.

27:07.190 --> 27:11.219
Now, that is... dark.

27:11.220 --> 27:14.129
- But it's... also...
- But it's good. No, it's good.

27:14.130 --> 27:16.179
Except, she is Roscoe's mother.

27:16.180 --> 27:18.059
So that makes it a little tricky for me.

27:18.060 --> 27:19.169
Yeah.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.219
I wish I didn't love Roscoe so much,

27:21.220 --> 27:23.999
because that's kind of my
favorite part of this plan.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.812
Are we jumping in?

27:36.253 --> 27:40.746
